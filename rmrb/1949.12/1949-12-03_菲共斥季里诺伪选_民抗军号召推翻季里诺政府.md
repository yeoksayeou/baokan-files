Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 1st. Electone News Agency, New York, 29th: In a statement regarding the recent elections in the Philippines, the Philippine Communist Party called on the people to "seriously consider the path taken by the Chinese people, draw appropriate lessons from this election, and act according to these lessons."

American puppet Quirino won the recent election through large-scale deception, violence, and terror. According to reports, after the "election victory," the Quirino regime has intensified its operations against farmers in Luzon Province who are engaged in armed resistance due to opposition to oppression and the failure to implement land reform. Peasant uprisings are developing in other parts of the country, and the People's Anti-Japanese Army has issued a call to overthrow the Quirino government.

In the weeks before the election, thousands of special police and civilian "police" were mobilized and armed to carry out organized terror against Quirino's opponents. They also engaged in large-scale fraud. In Lanao Province, even eleven and twelve-year-old children were called to vote for Quirino, and in those cities where the population had decreased since the last election, the number of voters suddenly doubled. On the other hand, 40 percent of registered voters in Manila were unable to vote because Quirino government officials had removed the polling booths.

Manila newspapers called the election "the bloodiest in Philippine history." Manila's working-class districts were searched by police with armored vehicles and machine guns, and the railway workers' strike was broken up with tanks. When it was found impossible to hold a conference in his own constituency, Philippine General Labor Union Secretary @① Luo withdrew from the congressional election in protest.

　　菲共斥季里诺伪选
    民抗军号召推翻季里诺政府
    【新华社北京一日电】电通社纽约二十九日讯：菲律宾共产党在关于最近菲律宾的选举声明中，号召人民“严重地思考中国人民所采取的道路，从这次选举中吸取适当的教训，并根据这种教训来行动。”
    美国傀儡季里诺在最近的选举中，以大规模的欺骗、暴行及恐怖手段获胜。据消息称，季里诺政权在“选举胜利”后，已加紧对因反对压迫与不实行土地改革而进行武装反抗的吕宋省农民的作战。农民暴动正在向国内的其它地方发展，民抗军已发出推翻季里诺政府的号召。
    在举行选举以前的数周中，数以千计的特别警察及民“警”被动员与武装起来，有组织地对季里诺的反对派进行恐怖统治。他们还进行了大规模的舞弊。在拉劳省，连十一岁与十二岁的小孩子都被叫去投季里诺的票，在上次选举以来人口已经减少的那些城市，突然发现选民人数增加了一倍。另一方面，马尼拉有百分之四十已登记的选民，无法投票，因为季里诺政府官员把投票棚拆走了。
    马尼拉报纸称这次选举是“菲律宾历史上最血腥的一次”。马尼拉工人区遭到带有装甲车和机关枪的警察的搜查，并用坦克破坏了铁路工人的罢工。菲律宾总工会书记＠①洛，当发现不可能在他自己的选区里召开大会的时候，退出了国会议员竞选，以表示抗议。
