　　An Introduction to the Situation in Rural Areas of Beijing's Suburbs
　　Shi Yan
　　The suburbs of Beijing consist of eight districts, encompassing ten outer city areas, twelve towns, and two hundred and sixty administrative villages, comprising one thousand six hundred and fifty-four natural villages. The total population is 646,270, with the agricultural population accounting for 54.9% and the non-agricultural population accounting for 45.1%. There are a total of 1,004,071 mu of cultivated land, averaging 2.8 mu per agricultural person. If non-agricultural people are also included, the average is only 1.5 mu per person.

　　While Beijing's suburban rural areas share characteristics common to all rural areas, they also possess unique features due to their proximity to the city. The main features are described below:

　　I. High Concentration of Land: According to statistics from six land reform experiment villages (Bagou, Huaifang, Xiaocun, Pingfang, Gaobeidian, and Xiaohongmen), the feudal landlord class, accounting for 9.3% of the total population, occupied 56% of all land, while the poor and hired peasants, accounting for 43.8% of the total population, occupied only 12.9% of the land. Furthermore, the land occupied by the landlord class was generally of higher quality. According to statistics from the six villages, the landlord class occupied 89.3% of all paddy fields, 58.3% of vegetable gardens, and 57.6% of irrigated land. The income per mu of paddy field or vegetable garden is generally equivalent to about 4 mu of dry land, and each mu of irrigated land is equivalent to about 2 mu of dry land. From this, it can be seen that the better the quality of the land, the greater the degree of concentration.

　　The primary reason for the high concentration of land is that Beijing has historically been the base of feudal rulers. Warlords, bureaucrats, feudal nobles, and eunuchs were highly concentrated here, and they all occupied land in the suburbs. Taking just the Nanyuan Haizi area as an example, sixty landlords of this type occupied 52,792 mu of land (incomplete statistics). Li Shouxin, Wu Peifu, Duan Qirui, Zhang Xun, and others each occupied more than a thousand mu of land. These landlords mostly lived in the city, relying on renting out land and extracting the peasants' blood and sweat to support their dissolute lives.

　　Because a large amount of land was occupied by these parasites, the peasants who labored on the land year-round had little or no land of their own, or only bad land, which greatly reduced their enthusiasm for production. This is the root cause of the inability of suburban agricultural productivity to develop.

　　II. Some Land is Operated in a Capitalist Manner: Due to proximity to the city, two characteristics have emerged in suburban rural production: (1) Simple machinery and modern equipment have been adopted on some land. For example, paddy fields in the western suburbs and Nanyuan have electric-powered wells, rice threshers, and rice hullers. Some vegetable gardens have greenhouses and hotbeds, and some orchards use chemical pesticides to prevent insect damage. (2) Agricultural production has been commercialized. According to imprecise statistics, the entire suburban area has 35,470.7 mu of vegetable gardens, 30,185.3 mu of paddy fields, 15,407 mu of orchards, and 1,318.6 mu of fishponds. These lands are all producing commodities to supply the needs of the city. In addition, there are over 40,000 mu of irrigated land that, in addition to growing two seasons of crops each year, also grow one season of vegetables for urban consumption. Even in the case of dry land, the land along the Yongding River in Shijingshan, Mentougou, Fengtai, Changxindian, and other districts is abundant in peanuts and watermelons, while some land in Fengtai, the southern suburbs, and the eastern suburbs produces cotton, and the western suburbs also produce water chestnuts. These agricultural products are also produced to supply the needs of the market.

　　To enable the land to produce the commodities needed by the city, and to adopt machinery and modern equipment, huge amounts of capital must be invested in the land. Therefore, there are more agricultural operations of a capitalist nature in the rural areas of Beijing's suburbs. According to statistics from the six villages of Bagou, etc., they use approximately forty households, using 46.9% of the total number of vegetable gardens, 86.4% of paddy fields, 56.2% of irrigated land, and 29.2% of dry land. This is also a characteristic of the agricultural land relations in Beijing's suburbs.

　　III. Peasants Have a Relatively High Class Consciousness: The concentration of land ownership and use has produced two phenomena: (1) Many tenant and poor peasants, (2) Many hired laborers. According to statistics from the six villages of Bagou, etc., there are 286 hired laborer households, accounting for 13.2% of agricultural households, and 400 tenant and poor peasant households, accounting for 18.5%.

　　Due to the large number of tenant and poor peasants (reflecting the large number of peasants who need land), landlords have adopted extremely harsh methods in the tenancy system. When renting land, a deposit must be paid, and rent must be paid in advance before the harvest. The rent is generally five dou per mu of dry land, and some charge six or seven dou. The large number of hired laborers is the result of the bankruptcy of the vast number of peasants under the cruel feudal exploitation of the feudal landlord class.

　　This has created an extremely sharp class contradiction. The peasant masses harbor great hatred for the landlord class that extracts their blood and sweat, and once enlightened, will form a strong fighting force. At the same time, due to their proximity to the city, peasants are more culturally advanced than peasants in general rural areas, and are more receptive to new things, so their class consciousness is also faster than that of peasants in general newly liberated rural areas. This is the most favorable condition for land reform in the suburbs of Beijing.

　　IV. The Landlord Class is More Vicious: The class consciousness of the masses in Beijing's suburbs is relatively fast, and the ruling methods of the landlord class are also more severe. This is reflected in the following aspects:

　　(1) Directly in Power: In general rural areas, landlords often hide behind the scenes during times of chaos and let their lackeys come forward to take power, while they secretly manipulate things. Beijing has always been the base of feudal rulers, and feudal rule has been very stable in any period, so the landlords in Beijing's suburbs are mostly directly in power. They not only rely on the feudal ownership of land to carry out economic exploitation of the peasants, but also use their direct control of political power to strengthen their exploitation and further carry out bestial harm to the peasants. Therefore, there are more extremely heinous despotic landlords in the suburbs than in general rural areas. Taking just the eastern suburbs as an example, there are the so-called "Four Heavenly Kings and One Tiger." From such titles, it can be seen how ferocious they are.

　　(2) Forming a Unified Entity with Secret Agents and Reactionary Taoist Sects: Before the liberation of Beijing, secret agents, with the help of landlords, had penetrated into rural areas in the suburbs to carry out activities. After liberation, landlords colluded even more with a large number of secret agents lurking in the suburbs, using farmers backwardness and ignorance, using sectarian societies as a cover, and actively carrying out sabotage activities.

　　(3) Struggle Methods are Varied: Most landlords oppress and exploit peasants in a naked way, but some landlords also use deceptive and anesthetizing means to make peasants unaware of the exploitation they are subjected to, at least for a time. For example, Xu Zhangshi, a landlord in Xiaohongmen, was considered by some people to have not exploited others when class designations were being made because he treated his hired laborers "well" at ordinary times. This kind of deception and anesthetization is used even more after liberation. Landlords have bought off hired laborers and bribed cadres, voluntarily taken out part of the land to distribute to peasants, and also used poor relatives and friends to disperse their property, attempting to use these tricks to maintain their feudal ruling position.

　　V. A Large Number of Non-Agricultural People Live Intermingled: The non-agricultural population of the entire suburban area accounts for 45.1% of the total population. Most of these people live in the outer city areas and towns, and many also live intermingled in rural areas. Looking at the six land reform experiment villages mentioned above, Xiaocun represents the rural areas near the suburbs, with the non-agricultural population accounting for 44.1%. The five villages of Bagou, Huaifang, Pingfang, Gaobeidian, and Xiaohongmen can represent the rural areas far from the suburbs, with the non-agricultural population accounting for about 10% to 20%. Among this part of the population, there are very few industrial workers. The 132 industrial workers in the six villages of Bagou, etc., account for only 5.8% of the non-agricultural population. The rest are craftsmen, small vendors, rickshaw pullers, or engage in selling vegetables, yellow soil, fishing, shrimp catching, and other occupations. Some people have no fixed occupation and do whatever work comes along. They also want a portion of the land. However, because there is not much land, it is already difficult to solve the land problem for the peasants alone, and it is practically impossible to solve the problem of the non-agricultural population from the land.

　　Based on the above analysis, it can be seen that a large amount of land in the rural areas of Beijing's suburbs is occupied by the feudal landlord class, and the right to use the land is also relatively concentrated, making it difficult for the vast number of peasants to breathe under the heavy pressure of the cruel feudal tenancy system, greatly hindering the development of productive forces, and seriously hindering urban construction and industrial construction. Therefore, the implementation of land reform will inevitably win the support of the vast number of peasants. Although the landlord class in the suburbs of Beijing is stubborn, vicious, and cunning, because the peasants' class consciousness is faster and easier to mobilize, as long as we firmly grasp the policies, patiently mobilize the masses, and implement the mass line, we will certainly be able to smoothly achieve the goal of completely eliminating the feudal forces in the suburbs of Beijing!

　　北京郊区农村情况介绍
    石  岩
    京郊八个区，辖十个关厢，十二个镇，二百六十个行政村，一千六百五十四个自然村。共有人口六四六、二七○人，其中农业人口占百分之五十四点九，非农业人口占百分之四十五点一。耕地共一、○○四、○七一亩，平均每一农业人口可有二亩八分地；如将非农业人口亦计算在内，平均每人仅有一亩半。
    京市郊区农村虽具有一般农村的特点，但因靠近都市，又有其不同之点。兹将主要特点，分述于后：
    一、土地高度的集中：根据巴沟、槐房、小村、平房、高碑店、小红门六个土改试验村的统计，占全人口百分之九点三的封建地主阶级占有全部土地的百分之五十六，占全人口百分之四十三点八的贫雇农，只占有土地百分之十二点九，同时地主阶级占有的都是好地。从巴沟等六村的统计看，地主阶级占有全部稻田的百分之八十九点三，菜园百分之五十八点三，水地的百分之五十七点六。每亩稻田、菜园的收入，一般约当旱地四亩，水地每亩约当旱地二亩，从这里也就可以看出：愈是质量好的土地，集中程度也愈大。
    土地高度集中后，主要原因，是由于北京历来为封建统治者的根据地。军阀、官僚、封建贵族太监集中在这里的很多，他们都在郊区占有土地。仅以南苑海子内来说，六十户这类地主，即占有土地五二、七九二亩（不完全的统计），李守信、吴佩孚、段祺瑞、张勋等占有土地都在千亩以上。这类地主多住在城内，靠出租土地，榨取农民的血汗来供给他们荒淫糜烂的生活。
    由于大量的土地为这批寄生虫所占有，终年在土地上劳动的农民没有或只有少量的坏地，因而大大减低了农民生产的积极性，这便是郊区农业生产力不能发展的根源。
    二、土地的经营方式，有些是资本主义性的。由于靠近都市，郊区农村在生产上便产生了两个特点：（一）有些土地上已采用了简单的机器及近代设备：如西郊及南苑的稻田，设置有电力水井、使用落稻机、剥米机等，有些菜园设置有暖室、温床，有些果园则施用化学药品防止虫害等；（二）农业生产商品化：据不精确的统计，全郊区共有菜园三五、四七○点七亩，稻田三○、一八五点三亩，果园一五、四○七亩，渔塘一、三一八点六亩。这些土地，都是为供给都市需要的商品而生产；此外，还有约四万多亩水浇地，每年除种两季庄稼外，还要种一季供都市人口食用的菜蔬。即以旱地而言：石景山、门头沟、丰台、长辛店等区沿永定河两岸的土地盛产花生、西瓜，丰台、南郊、东郊部分土地产棉花，西郊还产荸荠等，这些农产品也是为了供给市场的需要而生产的。
    要使土地能够生产都市需要的商品，采用机器及近代设备，都须有巨额的资本投到土地上。因此，京郊农村中带有资本主义性质的农业经营较多，他们使用的土地，据巴沟等六村的统计，约有四十户，使用菜园总数的百分之四十六点九，稻田的百分之八十六点四，水地的百分之五十六点二，旱地的百分之二十九点二。这也是京郊农业土地关系的一个特点。
    三、农民的阶级觉悟较高：由于土地的占有及使用的集中，便产生了这样两个现象：（一）佃中、贫农多，（二）雇农多。根据巴沟等六村的统计，雇农二八六户，占农业户口的百分之十三点二，佃中贫农四○○户，占百分之十八点五。
    由于佃中、贫农多（反映了需要土地的农民多），地主在租佃制度方面采取极厉害的办法：租地时须交押金，租子在未收获时预交，租额一般每亩旱地是五斗，有交至六、七斗者。雇农多是由于在封建地主阶级的残酷封建剥削下，广大农民破产的结果。
    这造成了极端尖锐的阶级对立，农民群众对于榨取他们血汗的地主阶级怀着极大的仇恨，一经启发，便会形成坚强的斗争力量。同时，由于靠近都市，农民受都市的影响，比一般农村农民的文化程度高，对于新事物容易接受，因而阶级觉悟也就比一般新区农村农民为快，这是京郊土改最有利的条件。
    四、地主阶级更为凶狠：京郊群众的阶级觉悟较快，地主阶级的统治手段也比较厉害，这表现在以下几方面：
    （一）直接当政：一般农村的地主，在时局混乱时，往往躲到幕后，让他们的狗腿子出面当政，自己则暗中操纵。北京历来是封建统治者的根据地，在任何时期，封建统治都很稳固，所以京郊地主多直接当政。他们不仅依靠土地的封建占有对农民实行经济上的剥削，而且利用其直接掌握政权加强其剥削，并进一步的对农民实行兽性的残害。因此，郊区罪大恶极的恶霸地主也就较一般农村为多。仅以东郊一区来说，就有所谓“四大天王一只虎”，从这样的称号中，就可以看出他们是何等的凶恶了。
    （二）与特务、反动道门结成一体：北京解放前，特务分子已在地主帮助下，深入到郊区农村活动。解放后，地主更与大批潜伏在郊区的特务勾结起来，利用农民的落后愚昧，以会门为掩护，积极进行破坏活动。
    （三）斗争方式是各式各样的：一般地主多是赤裸裸的对农民进行压迫剥削，但也有一部分地主用欺骗麻醉手段，使农民虽受剥削而一时尚不自觉者。如小红门的地主徐张氏，因为平时待雇工较“好”，在划阶级时有些人就说他没有剥削。此种欺骗、麻醉的方式，在解放以后应用的更多。地主有收买雇工、利诱干部的，有自动拿出一部分土地分给农民的，也有利用贫苦的亲友以疏散财产的，企图运用这些花样，保持他们的封建统治地位。
    五、杂居有大批非农业人口：全郊区非农业人口占总人口百分之四十五点一。这些人大部分住在关厢、街镇，混居在农村的也不少。以前述的六个土改试验村来看，小村是代表近郊的农村，非农业人口占百分之四十四点一；巴沟、槐房、平房、高碑店、小红门五村可以代表远郊农村，非农业人口约占百分之十到二十。这部分人口中，产业工人很少，巴沟等六村产业工人共一三二人仅占非农业人口的百分之五点八，其余的则为手工业者、小商贩、三轮车夫，或从事卖菜、卖黄土、打鱼、捞虾等业，有些人没有固定职业，遇到什么活就干什么。他们也都想要一部分土地。但是因为土地不多，单解决农民的土地问题已感不敷分配，事实上不可能再从土地上来解决非农业人口的问题。
    根据以上分析，可知京郊农村大量的土地为封建地主阶级所占有，而且土地的使用权也比较集中，使广大的农民在残酷的封建的租佃制度的重压下喘不过气来，大大妨碍了生产力的发展，使都市建设及工业建设受到严重阻碍。因此实行土地改革，必然会获得广大农民的拥护。虽然京郊的地主阶级顽强、凶狠、狡诈，但因农民的阶级觉悟较快，易于发动，只要我们紧紧地掌握政策，耐心地发动群众，贯彻群众路线，我们就一定能够顺利的达到彻底消灭京郊封建势力的目的！
