At the meetings, Wan Jingshu from the textile dyeing industry, Liu Kejing from the construction industry, and Yan Xigu from the tea industry spoke one after another, all agreeing that purchasing public bonds is primarily the task of the industrial and commercial sectors, so these sectors should enthusiastically subscribe.
