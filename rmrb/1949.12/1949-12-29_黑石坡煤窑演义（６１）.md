The people stared for a while, and Old Yin stamped his feet anxiously, saying, "Is there really nothing we can do?" At this moment, Lin Bao barged in, announcing to everyone, "The coal yard is in an uproar! Shuan Cheng, you..." Shuan Cheng and Xi Lu quickly stood up to go and sort things out. Da San said to Old Yin, "Don't panic! The wind isn't so strong yet. Quickly find a way to buy calcium carbide and light carbide lamps! I guarantee it will break through in less than ten days!" The little foreigner, upon hearing this news, also ran towards the coal yard. Bian Xiao, however, said that there were still some opinions on the division of land to be arranged, and he wanted to pull Lin Bao to help, so the two of them left. Old Yin, Da San, and Tian Lu then began calculating the purchase of calcium carbide.

Calcium carbide could be bought, and there were lamps, but there was no money! Old Yin thought about how he had written three "urgent"s in his letter to Old Bai, so he could only wait for a reply! He then changed the subject and asked, "Are you sure it will work in ten days?" Da San said, "We can hear the sound of the picks digging 'kong kong' on both sides, so I'm eight or ninety percent sure." Old Yin said, "But how can some people say that the families on the slope above the mine, so far from the bottom of the mine, can also hear the sound?" Tian Lu said, "That's different! The distance is definitely not that far!" Da San took his broken top hat off his head and said, "Old Yin, you can't be impatient about this! @His mother, they can only dig two or three feet a day. The West Mine has to go around the northwest wall and then turn back to dig, and the terrain near the ground is probably watery, so you can't! Besides, you've seen it: no one wants to dig the 'seven'! @His mother, the West Mine has been producing less coal these days!" At this time, Tian Lu made a suggestion, saying that the coal miners are all digging hard lumps of coal, and this "seven" is neither soft nor hard, so the miners are not used to it. But iron @stone is also neither soft nor hard, so see if it's okay to change a few digging @masters to dig the "seven"! Da San said, "Let's try it, let's try it!" As he spoke, he put on his top hat, stood up, walked back and forth in the room with his hands folded, and sighed, "@His mother, I've really been suffocating these days! If I had my old temper... Alas! In the past, if things didn't go my way, I would either get angry or sulk without saying a word, but neither of those work now! Well, I'll talk to them reasonably! But even if people clearly trust you, they still have to say a few unpleasant words to you... Alas!" After saying that, he didn't say another word, just kept walking back and forth. Old Yin felt that his temper had indeed changed a bit, so he looked up at him, but when he looked, he saw that his broken top hat and cotton-padded jacket were covered in mud and water, his face was also black, and he had lost weight, with two big eyes that looked like two hollows: he was just too tired! Old Yin thought: How come I didn't notice his appearance in the past! Old Yin turned his head to look at Tian Lu again, but Tian Lu was also so tired that he fell asleep leaning against the kang! Old Yin said to Da San, "Let's go take a look at the coal yard! Let your second brother rest for a while!" Tian Lu woke up with an "Ah" and walked with them.

**57 Victory**

Before Old Yin and the others reached the coal yard, they heard a earth-shattering noise coming from the coal yard, so they quickly broke into a run and hurried over. It turned out that Old Bai had arrived. He received Old Yin's letter on the way here, so he took a shortcut and ran straight here. When he entered the village and arrived at the coal yard, the coal miners were arguing about the hard wind that had started at the bottom of the mine, and Shuan Cheng was still hoarsely explaining to the people. Old Bai didn't ask why, but immediately jumped onto the big stove in the coal yard and shouted, "Hey! The county has allocated 1,000 catties of loan grain to our village! The grain has arrived at the district!" This shout made people lose their composure and not know how to deal with it. The little foreigner also climbed onto the stove and opened his mouth: "Didn't I say? The wind isn't that strong yet, and we can go down by buying calcium carbide lamps! I guarantee it will break through in ten days! Let's go, let's carry the grain!" The people immediately shouted again: "The wind is still not too strong!" "I think carbide lamps might work!" "Let's go! Maybe we won't even need ten days!" "Forget about it! Let's get the grain first!"... Shuan Cheng said, "Yes! I'll send someone!" But people started pulling and grabbing people and livestock automatically. When Old Yin and the others arrived, Lin Bao also came down from the slope "hehe" smiling. Liu Gou's family ran up and grabbed him, saying, "Lin Bao, there's a solution again! I think I'll postpone my supply for another two days!" Then a bunch of people ran up and surrounded Lin Bao and Xi Lu, saying, "Let's also put together five days without receiving!" "Record five days for me too..." Lin Bao said, "I only have two ears, can you let me remember it! Alas! I didn't see it for the first three days, but everyone was glaring and insisting on receiving! Grandpa Xi Lu, you should record it quickly!" Xi Lu also kept smiling and saying, "Hey, hey, okay! We welcome you not receiving it for a day!" Shuan Cheng ran up and called Lin Bao, "Lin Bao, whether you record it or not, people just won't take it out of the account if they don't receive it! Our Uncle Xi Lu is a bit older than you, go run a trip, and manage to get the grain back." A young man came and pushed Lin Bao forward, saying, "Old man, ride my donkey!" Lin Bao "cough! cough!" sighed and left with the people. Da San announced a day off work and told everyone to tidy up their furniture.

That night, the grain was carried back, and the next day Xi Lu, Shuan Cheng, and the little foreigner went to Yangquan to buy a catty of calcium carbide, and the bottom of the mine was bright again. Da San also assigned a few @ diggers who had dug the "seven", and even old man Bian Xiao, this @ kiln master, also finished dividing the land and automatically went down to the coal mine. Indeed! These people dug in one or two feet in one shift, and those digging the air ducts on both sides could not only hear the sound of the picks, but even the shouts. It was just that the hard wind was still choking people and making them uncomfortable. The West Mine was a little better, but those digging the "seven" in the East Mine had to come to the coal yard to change the air after digging for a meal's worth of time. Old Yin went down once and fainted for half a day before waking up. However, people all seemed to have a ten-point certainty, all of them were peaceful and energetic, and the unpleasant lazy words disappeared. The coal production of Tai Cheng and the others in the West Mine was also higher.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（６１）
    康濯
    人们瞪了会子眼，老尹急得直跺脚，一边说：“这可一点法也没有了么？”这时林宝闯了进来，告大家道：“窑场上闹翻了天哩！拴成你们……”拴成喜禄忙立起来安顿去；大三对老尹道：“甭发慌！风还硬得不那么厉害，快想法买电石点电石灯吧！我保险不出十天准透开！”小洋鬼一听这讯，就也往窑场跑去了，扁小却说还有些对分地的意见要去安插，并要拉着林宝帮忙，他二人也就走了。老尹大三天禄便计算买电石的事。
    电石倒能买着，灯也有，就是钱没法！老尹想着他给老白的信上写了三个“万急”，只得等回信吧！便转过话头问：“十天准行么？”大三道：“两边听得镢头刨的‘空空’乱响，怎么我也有八九成底底了。”老尹道：“可怎么有人说：窑顶坡坡上的人家，离窑底那么远，也听见响音的？”天禄道：“那跟这不一样！远的确不远了！”大三把破礼帽从脑袋上抓下来说：“这事老尹你不能性急！＠他妈一天怎么也只刨个二三尺，西窑又非绕西北墙再翻回刨，近地势怕有水，你没法！再说，你也见来着：刨‘七’是谁也不乐意干！＠他妈西窑这两天出炭又出少了！”天禄这时却提了个意见，说刨炭的刨头们尽刨的是硬块炭，这“七”不软不硬的，刨头们刨不惯手；可铁＠石也是不软不硬，看换几个刨＠的把式刨刨“七”行不！大三道：“试吧试吧吧！”说着，他戴上礼帽立起来，抄着两手在屋里来回走着，并叹息着说：“＠他妈这阵子可真憋得我够受！要依着我那脾性态度呀……唉！往日我要不如心意，不是动火就是死憋住不说，可这会这两下都不顶！好吧，我就跟人家说说道理吧！可人家明明信服了你，也非跟你说两句不受听的话……唉！”说完，他又一声不响，只管来回走着；老尹觉着他这人的脾性倒的确改了些，就抬着头看他，但这一看，却见他那破礼帽和棉袄肩上背上尽是泥水，脸也黑了，人也瘦了，俩大眼还象落了两个洼：他也就是太劳累了！老尹想着：过去自己怎么没注意他这模样啊！老尹又回头看看天禄，天禄却也累得靠着炕头睡着了！老尹对大三说：“走，窑场看看去！你老二就让他歇一会吧！”天禄却“啊”的一声，醒转来，和他们相跟着走了。
    五十七　胜利
    老尹他们还没走到窑场，就听见窑场那边闹得震天动地，他们赶紧撒开腿加快脚步，慌忙往过跑；原来那边是老白来了。他在来这里的半路上接了老尹的信，就抄了条小道直往这边小跑，进了村，赶到窑场，窑黑们正为窑底起了硬风在乱咯吵，拴成还在破着嗓子给人们解说；老白却没问情由，一来便跳到窑场的大火炉上吆喝：“喂！县里给咱村拨了一千斤贷粮！粮到了区上了！”这一吆喝闹得人们倒乱了手脚，不知怎么对付；小洋鬼却也爬上火炉开了腔：“我不是说过么？风还硬得不厉害，买电石点灯能下去！十天保险透开！走吧，驮粮去吧！”下边立时又嚷闹起来：“风就是还不太硬！”我看电石灯还怕就是能行！“闹吧！还许十天也用不了哩！”“管球它哩！粮食闹来再说！”……拴成道：“对！我派人！”人们却七拉八扯地自动开了人和牲口。赶老尹们赶到，林宝也“呵呵”笑着从坡上下来了，柳沟家便跑上去拉住他说：“林宝，又有法啦！我看我再晚两天支供应！”接着就有一堆人跑上去围住林宝和喜禄道：“咱也再凑合五天不领！”“给我也记上五天吧……”林宝道：“我可只有两耳朵，你们也让我记住不呀！唉！没见头三天，可一个个都是立眉瞪眼地非支不行！喜禄爷，你快给记上吧！”喜禄也一边“嗨，嗨，行！一天不支也欢迎！”一边笑得合不拢嘴。拴成跑上来叫林宝道：“林宝，记不记的，反正人们不支就不上帐呗！咱喜禄叔比你还上点年岁，你跑一趟吧，经管着把粮闹回来。”有个青年来就推着林宝往前走，并说：“老汉，你骑我的驴去！”林宝“咳！咳！”叹息着，跟人们走了。这边大三宣布歇工一天，并让大伙拾掇拾掇家具。
    当天连夜就驮回了粮食，第二天喜禄拴成小洋鬼相跟去阳泉，买回一斤电石，窑底就又亮了。大三并拨了几个刨过＠的刨“七”，连老汉扁小这＠窑把式，也忙完了分地，自动下了炭窑；果真！这人们一班就刨进一二尺，两边刨风筒的，不光听见镢头响，就连吆喝也能听见。只是硬风还是让人呛得不行憋的难受，西窑倒好点，东窑刨“七”的，一人刨个顿把饭工夫，就得上窑场来换换气，老尹有回下去还晕了半天醒不来；不过人们却都象拿住了十成底底，一个个安安生生地，劲头足足地，不受听的赖话也没了影，西窑泰成们的炭又出得多些了。
