　　Suiyuan Uprising Troops
  　Strengthen Reorganization Preparations
  　Generals Dong Qiwu and Sha Lanfeng Answer Questions from Our Reporter
    [Our reporter Li Yi's special dispatch from Guisui, 20th] "Strive to make the troops like the People's Liberation Army!" This is the most central goal of General Dong Qiwu's troops, who revolted in Suiyuan on September 19th of this year. On December 20th, this reporter visited Generals Dong Qiwu and Sun Lanfeng, former heads of the Suiyuan military, in Guisui Xincheng to inquire in detail about the reorganization of the army. Generals Dong and Sun first told the reporter that the reorganization of the original Suiyuan troops is being strengthened in preparation. Before their uprising, the Suiyuan troops had eight infantry divisions and seven cavalry brigades, which will be reorganized into two infantry corps and one cavalry division. The commanding officers of the army have been appointed by the Central People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and the surplus personnel will be properly安置安置, or engaged in production. General Sun Lanfeng said that this rational reorganization is the beginning of a new life for the old army. He repeatedly emphasized that "the troops must be lean and efficient." General Sun said: The uprising on September 19th was a watershed. Only today can I say that I have begun to embark on the road of serving the people. He said that participating in the CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) meeting had helped him find direction and become a smart person. Finally, Generals Dong and Sun specifically mentioned three things to the reporter: First, they will first eliminate Kuomintang secret agents; second, they will launch a 4,000-person study group in the near future to train cadres for the transformation of the troops; third, they have followed Chairman Mao's instructions and divided the troops into four regions for large-scale production.

  　董其武纱兰峰两将军答本报记者问
    【本报记者李翼二十日归绥专电】“为使部队解放军化而奋斗!”这是本年九月十九日在绥远举义的董其武将军所部当前最中心的努力目标。本月二十日记者于归绥新城往访原绥远军方负责人董其武、孙兰峰两将军，详询有关军队整编问题。董、孙两将军首先告诉记者说，原绥远部队的整编事宜正加强准备中。他们起义以前，绥远部队共有八个步兵师，七个骑兵旅，将整编为两个步兵军，一个骑兵师。军队指挥干部已由中央人民革命军事委员会任命，编余人员将分别适当安置，或从事生产事业。孙兰峰将军说，此种合理整编为使旧军队获得新生命的开始，他一再强调“兵必须精”。孙将军说：九月十九日举义是一个分水岭，我到今天才可以说是开始走上了为人民服务的大道。他说由于参加了政协会议，使他找到了方向，变成了聪明人。最后，董、孙两将军特别向记者谈及三事：第一，他们将首先肃清国民党特务分子；第二，他们将在近期开办四千人的学习团，为改造部队培养骨干；第三，他们已依照毛主席的指示，将部队划分四个地区进行大生产。
