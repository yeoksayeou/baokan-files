    Section 4: The Revolutionary, Militant, and Practical Nature of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy

    Due to the widespread dissemination of Marx's doctrine, which won the support and love of the broad proletariat, bourgeois political economists became alarmed. In order to protect the interests of the bourgeoisie and to defend the reputation of fallen bourgeois gentlemen, they, especially the vulgar economists, began to wantonly and madly attack Marx's doctrine, even fabricating rumors and slanders. They seized upon a misspelled name in Marx's "The Poverty of Philosophy" and began to scream wildly. They used such nitpicking and fault-finding to fabricate rumors and slanders, attempting to break through the only truth of Marx's doctrine, while daring not to engage in a frontal theoretical struggle with him. Later, only some seemingly more clever bourgeois scholars dared to find a basis in Marx's theory to fundamentally overthrow Marx. They claimed that Marx's theory of rent was plagiarized from the German Rodbertus's theory of rent, and that the theory of surplus value was not Marx's own creation. Some said that there were contradictions in the theory of value in the first and third volumes of Capital, and so on. At that time, Engels severely refuted such malicious attacks and rumors against Marx's economic theory by bourgeois political economists, striking down their despicable tricks (see Engels's preface to the second and third volumes of Capital). At the same time, because Capital is a correct, concrete, and profound reflection of the capitalist social economy, it fully demonstrates its truthfulness, profoundness, and foresight in criticizing bourgeois political economy and answering the accusations of bourgeois political economists, showing that it is a powerful and sharp theoretical weapon of the proletariat. Therefore, it finally destroyed all the malicious attacks of bourgeois political economists, exposed the hypocrisy, weakness, deceptiveness, and reactionary nature of bourgeois political theory, and made Capital more widely popular in various countries, becoming the earliest classic work of Marxist-Leninist political economy.

    After Marx's death, Engels single-handedly took on the task of fighting against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois political economy (see the preface to the third edition of the first volume of Capital). After Engels's death, Lenin and Stalin succeeded in taking on this combat task, launching fierce and resolute struggles with the various schools of bourgeois political economists after Marx and Engels. On the one hand, they continuously criticized various erroneous and reactionary views of bourgeois scholars, exposing the class essence of various schools of bourgeois economics. At the same time, they gave heavy blows to the attacks of bourgeois political economy on Marxist-Leninist political economy.

    Lenin and Stalin Defended and Developed Marxist-Leninist Political Economy in the Struggle Against Opportunists

    With the growth of the proletariat's strength, the upsurge of the proletarian revolutionary movement, and the more widespread dissemination of Marxism, especially the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, the bourgeois spokesmen intensified their work of distorting, sabotaging, falsifying, and emasculating Marxist political economy after the malicious attacks and rumors of bourgeois political economy against Marxist political economy were declared a failure. Either they used various superficial economic phenomena to explain that the capitalist economy was rational and eternal, or they called themselves Marxist political economists, as the opportunists of Germany, France, and England, the "Austrian Marxists," the Russian Mensheviks, and other "left" and right opportunists did. They secretly distorted, emasculated, and revised the doctrines of Marxist political economy to suit the requirements of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the true Marxist political economists had to take on the combat task of defending Marxist political economy.

    Lenin and Stalin waged tireless and irreconcilable struggles with various opportunists on various economic issues. For example, as we can see in the writings of Lenin and Stalin, Lenin and Stalin fought against Plekhanov, Bogdanov, Kautsky, Bernstein, Hilferding, Rubin, and other schools of opportunists and revisionists. On the other hand, we can also see Lenin and Stalin's numerous and fierce struggles with the Narodniks, Romantics, Anarchists, Social Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and the Trotsky-Bukharin bandits in Russia on various economic doctrines and viewpoints. In many sharp struggles, the incomparable scientific value and invincible truth of Marxist political economy were fully proven. Like Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin defended the Marxist political economy doctrine amidst various distortions, misunderstandings, and malicious attacks, and further developed this doctrine into Marxist-Leninist political economy.

    In China, after Marxist-Leninist political economy was introduced, it first suffered persecution from imperialism, feudalism, and the comprador bourgeoisie, and launched a cruel struggle with them. Later, on the one hand, it grew and developed in the long-term struggle against the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary rule, against China's feudal and semi-feudal economic doctrines and economic propositions, against the economic doctrines and economic propositions of China's comprador and bureaucratic bourgeoisie, against the economic doctrines and economic propositions of the imperialists and their agents, and against the economic doctrines and economic propositions of the Chinese national bourgeoisie's weakness and duplicity. On the other hand, it also grew and developed in the struggle against various economic propositions of the Chinese petty bourgeoisie, against the Chinese Trotskyist gang, and against various opportunist and revisionist economic propositions in China, and made remarkable achievements in the work of Sinicizing Marxist-Leninist political economy. In the future, with the victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution, it will further play its fighting role in the New Democratic construction.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（５９）
　  政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    王学文
    第四节马列主义政治经济学的革命性、战斗性与实践性
    由于马克思学说的普遍传布，获得广大无产阶级的拥护爱戴，资产阶级政治经济学者，于是就着了慌，他们为了保护资产阶级的利益，为了资产阶级绅士坠落了的声誉辩护，他们尤其是庸俗派，他们就开始恣意疯狂的对马克思的学说进行攻击，甚至造谣诬蔑。他们抓住了马克思在哲学的贫困一书中写错了一个人名，就大肆狂叫起来。他们就是这样用挑剔吹毛求疵，来造谣中伤，企图攻破唯一真理的马克思学说，而不敢与他做正面的理论斗争。以后只有一些看来似乎比较高明的资产阶级学者，才敢想从马克思理论中找出根据来，从根本上来推翻马克思，他们说什么马克思的地租论是从德国罗贝尔图地租学说中抄来的，又说什么剩余价值说并不是马克思自己的创造。有的说在资本论第一卷及第三卷中价值论有什么矛盾等等。当时恩格斯对于资产阶级政治经济学者这种对马克思经济学说的恶意攻击，造谣中伤，都给予了严厉的还击，打击了他们这种卑鄙的伎俩（见资本论第二卷第三卷恩格斯序言）。同时，由于资本论是资本主义社会经济正确的、具体的、深刻的反映，故在批判资产阶级政治经济学与回答资产阶级政治经济学者在责难中，充分表现出它的真理性、深刻性与远见性，显示出它是无产阶级有力的、锐利的理论武器，因此终于摧毁了一切资产阶级政治经济学者的恶意攻击，暴露了资产阶级政治学理论的虚伪性、薄弱性、欺骗性与反动性，使资本论在各国更加广泛地流行起来，成为马列主义政治经济学最早的古典著作。
    与资产阶级，小资产阶级政治经济学的斗争，马克思逝世后，由恩格斯独力担当起了这个任务（见资本论第一卷第三版序文）。恩格斯逝世后，则由列宁斯大林继起担当了这个战斗的任务，与马克思恩格斯以后的资产阶级各派政治经济学者，展开了激烈的坚决的斗争。一方面继续不断的批判了资产阶级学者各种错误的反动的观点，揭发了各派资产阶级经济学的阶级本质。同时对于资产阶级政治经济学对马列主义政治经济学的攻击，都给予了沉重的回击。
    列宁、斯大林从与机会主义者斗争中捍卫与发展了马列主义政治经济学
    随着无产阶级力量的成长，无产阶级革命运动的高涨与马克思主义的更加广泛传播，特别是苏联十月社会主义革命的胜利，使得资产阶级代言人，在资产阶级政治经济学对马克思主义政治经济学的恶意攻击造谣诬蔑宣告失败以后，加紧了对马克思主义政治经济学的歪曲破坏伪造阉割的工作，他们或者分开用种种表面的经济现象来解释资本主义经济是合理的与永恒的，或者他们自称为马克思主义政治经济学者，如德法英的机会主义者，“奥地利的马克思主义者”，俄国的孟塞维克以及其他各种“左”的和右的机会主义者所做的那样，他们暗中歪曲阉割修正马克思主义政治经济学的学说，使它适合于资产阶级的要求。因此真正的马克思主义政治经济学者，便不得不担当起了捍卫马克思主义政治经济学的战斗任务。
    列宁、斯大林与各色机会主义者，在各种经济学的问题上展开了不懈恕不调和的斗争，例如我们在列宁与斯大林的著作中可以看到的，列宁斯大林曾与普列哈诺夫，波格达诺夫，考茨基，伯恩斯基，希尔费丁，鲁滨等等各派机会主义者，修正主义者斗争，另一方面也可以看到列宁、斯大林在俄国与民粹派、浪漫派、无政府主义派、社会革命党、孟塞维克、托洛茨基——布哈林匪徒在各种经济学说观点上无数次的剧烈的斗争。在许多尖锐的斗争中，完全证明了马克思主义政治经济学无可比拟的科学价值和它不可战胜的真理性。列宁、斯大林也和马克思、恩格斯一样，在各种各样的歪曲误解和恶意攻击中捍卫了马克思主义的政治经济学学说，并且进一步发展了这个学说，成为马克思列宁主义的政治经济学。
    在中国，自马列主义政治经济学介绍进来以后，它首先遭受了帝国主义、封建主义与买办资产阶级的迫害，并与它们展开了残酷的斗争，以后一方面是在与国民党反革命统治、与中国封建主义的与半封建的经济学说经济主张，与中国买办的、官僚资产阶级的经济学说经济主张，与帝国主义者及其代理人的经济学说经济主张以及与中国民族资产阶级软弱性两面性的经济学说和经济主张，进行长期的斗争中成长发展起来，另一方面也是在与中国小资产阶级的各种经济主张以及与中国托洛茨基匪帮与中国各种机会主义的与修正主义的经济主张，进行斗争中成长发展起来，并使马列主义政治经济学的中国化工作获得显著的成就。今后将随着中国人民民主革命的胜利，在新民主主义建设中，更加发挥它战斗的作用。
