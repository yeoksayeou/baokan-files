　　May Your Life Be as Long as the Southern Mountain's Evergreen Pine
    —A Record of the North China Military Region's Troops Stationed in Beijing Celebrating Stalin's Birthday

    In the square, shaded by dozens of red flags, millions of red silk flowers adorned the chests of countless soldiers. A giant statue of Stalin, hung in the center of the venue, overlooked the armed forces of the Chinese people. On either side of the statue hung a golden couplet, celebrating Stalin's "Fortune as boundless as the Eastern Sea" and "Life as long as the Southern Mountain's evergreen pine." The anti-aircraft guns erected in front of the venue were polished to a shine by the soldiers. Large and small tanks, armored vehicles, and mobile artillery pieces arranged on both sides of the venue emitted a dazzling light. On the red lacquered table, laden with longevity peaches and noodles, sat Chinese-style incense burners and candlesticks. As the candles were lit and military music played, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De entered the venue. As Commander-in-Chief Zhu De approached the statue of Stalin, photographers joyfully captured this moving moment, smiling and saying, "We will send this film to Stalin."
    Chief of Staff Tang Yanjie of the North China Military Region stepped to the microphone and, on behalf of the North China Military Region troops, wished Stalin a happy birthday. He said, "Today, people all over the world are warmly celebrating Stalin's birthday. We celebrate Stalin's birthday to learn from Stalin. Stalin means victory." The Chinese people learned Stalin's theories, armed themselves to oppose armed counter-revolution, and after more than twenty years of arduous struggle, the Chinese people have triumphed. Standing next to a tank, combat hero Ning Zhenhua told me, "Without Stalin, there would be no victory today, and there would be no heroic title for me today." At this moment, we also heard combat hero Yang Zhirun's call from the rostrum: "In the future, we must strengthen the national defense construction of New China and support Stalin with practical actions."
    Around Commander-in-Chief Zhu De were piled many gifts presented to Stalin. Among these gifts was a green signature book filled with congratulatory messages and names. This signature book was presented by the well-known Hero Company of the North China Military Region. On the night of the 20th, all the soldiers of the company did not sleep, and each wrote their name in the signature book, writing different sentences expressing their love for Stalin. This company used three cannons to control the Taiyuan Airport in the battle to liberate Taiyuan. Yan Xishan's bandits once fired three thousand shells at them every day, but they never feared. They fought hard in the mountains and finally annihilated the enemy and successfully completed their mission. After Commander-in-Chief Zhu De reviewed the troops, the mass calisthenics of the special forces began. Hundreds of agile heroes in black uniforms emerged from both sides of the Stalin statue, divided into five arrowheads, and appeared before us. They performed actions such as "hitting a baseball" and "digging artillery positions," and then formed four tanks, vividly driving to the side of the rostrum. As they formed the words "Sino-Soviet Friendship," "Long Live Stalin," and "Boundless Longevity," the People's Air Force appeared above our heads at the right time. The planes circled in the sky ten times, scattering countless red and green strips of paper, all of which were printed with many words congratulating Stalin. In the center of the venue, on either side of the towering Stalin statue, eight female soldiers wearing red and green silk costumes, holding large paper-made longevity peaches, danced joyfully in front of the Stalin statue. They placed the longevity peaches in front of the Stalin statue and sang songs praising Stalin. Millions of hands throughout the venue were raised to the sky, and millions of voices cheered in unison, "Long Live Stalin! Long Live Stalin!"

　　寿比南山不老松
    ——记华北军区驻京部队欢庆斯大林寿辰
    陈迹
    在数十面红旗掩映着的广场上，千万朵红绸作成的花挂在万千战士的胸旁。悬挂在会场中央的斯大林巨像，俯视着中国人民的武装。巨像两旁，悬着一副金字的对联，庆祝斯大林“福如东海长流水”、“寿比南山不老松”。会场前方屹立的高射炮被战士们擦得发亮。会场两旁排列的大小坦克车、装甲车和机动炮发射出耀眼的光芒。陈设着寿桃寿面的红漆桌上，放着中国式的香炉烛台。当燃起蜡烛，奏起军乐的时候，朱总司令走进会场；当朱总司令走近斯大林巨像时，摄影师欣悦地照下这个动人的镜头，他们笑着说：“我们要把这影片送给斯大林。”
    华北军区参谋长唐延杰走到扩音器前面，代表华北军区部队向斯大林祝寿，他说：“今天全世界人民都在热烈庆祝斯大林寿辰。我们庆祝斯大林寿辰，要学习斯大林。斯大林就是胜利。”中国人民学会了斯大林的理论，武装起来反对武装的反革命；经过了二十多年的艰苦奋斗，中国人民胜利了。站在坦克车的旁边的战斗英雄寗振华告诉我：“没有斯大林，就没有今天的胜利，更不会有我今天的英雄称号。”这时候，我们又听到主席台上一位战斗英雄杨志润的号召：“今后我们要加强新中国的国防建设，以实际行动拥护斯大林。”
    在朱总司令的周围，堆满了许多献给斯大林的礼物。在这些礼物中，有一本绿色的签名簿，上面写满了祝词和名字。这个签名簿，是华北军区闻名的英雄连所献送的。在二十日的夜晚，全连战士没有睡觉，每个人都在签名簿上写了自己的名字，写了各不相同的热爱斯大林的句子。这个连在解放太原的战役中，曾用三门炮控制了太原飞机场，阎匪锡山曾经每天以三千发炮弹投向他们，他们从未畏惧。他们在丛山峻岭中艰苦作战，终于歼灭了敌人，胜利完成了任务。朱总司令阅兵后。特种兵部队的团体操开始了。几百个矫健的身穿黑衣的英雄，从斯大林巨像两旁，分成五个箭头，涌现在我们面前。他们表演了“打捧球”和“挖炮兵阵地”等动作，又排成四辆坦克车，活生生地驶到主席台边。当他们排成“中苏友好”、“斯大林万岁”、“万寿无疆”等字样时，人民空军适时地出现在我们头顶。飞机在天空盘旋十周，散发了无数红绿色的字条，字条上，都印了许多祝贺斯大林的词句。在会场的中心，在矗立着的斯大林巨像的两侧，八个穿着红绿绸缎衣裳的女战士，手拿着纸札成的大寿桃，欢悦地在斯大林像前舞蹈。她们把寿桃摆在斯大林巨像之前，唱起了赞颂斯大林的歌声；全场千万双手举向天空，千万个声音一齐欢呼“斯大林万岁！斯大林万岁！”
