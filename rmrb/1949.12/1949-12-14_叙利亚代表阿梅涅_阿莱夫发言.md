Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th: The following is a summary of the speech by Amineh Arlef, representative of the Syrian Women's Association for the Protection of Mothers and Children, at the third meeting of the Asian Women's Representative Conference:

　　Women from all over the world are very happy to participate in the Asian Women's Representative Conference.

　　We Syrian women, like other women, have joined their ranks. We want to declare to the world: We Syrian women will never allow the imperialists to turn our country into a base for aggression against the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic Republics! We have come from a very far place to pay our respects to the victorious Chinese people who have liberated themselves from the clutches of imperialism and turned their country into a fortress of peace.

　　We are here to pay our respects to the Soviet women and to the women of the People's Democracies, who are the vanguard of the struggle for peace and democracy!

　　We must also pay our respects to the democratic women in the imperialist countries, because they are also fighting the imperialists alongside us.

　　We are here to ask you to listen to the voices of Syrian women so that you can understand how they are fighting the imperialists for their own liberation.

　　The Syrian people hate the American, British, and French imperialists who have caused them so much suffering. They feel the friendship of the Soviet Union. It was because the Soviet Union is a friend of all countries, and because the Soviet representative Vyshinsky used the veto in the United Nations, that the British and French troops withdrew from Syria.

　　The "Syrian Women's Association for the Protection of Mothers and Children" is fighting for peace, for the liberation of the country, and for the protection of the rights of mothers and children. This organization has suffered oppression from all the successive governments in Syria. Its chairman, Shaluna Benny, was once wanted, and its secretary, Omi Shasha Koya, and forty-one members were arrested and imprisoned. Women once organized mass demonstrations demanding the release of all arrested democrats and an end to Nazi-style barbarism, but without success. All those arrested held a seven-day hunger strike. This movement had a great impact on the Syrian people living under terror. Under the current government, our group, along with many other democratic groups, held demonstrations on October 2nd, the International Day of Struggle for Peace. This movement received a great response from the people. When the marching队伍 passed through the market, the masses expressed their enthusiastic approval and support, and the police could not stop them.

　　This group also held a meeting to celebrate International Women's Day, with a large-scale demonstration in Homes. The marchers carried banners calling on Syrian women to unite with women all over the world to fight against imperialism and strive for peace, and repelled police arrests, achieving the goal of submitting a petition to the government.

　　Finally, we want to combine the voices of Syrian women with the voices of women all over the world and shout: We don't want war! The responsibility of us women and mothers is to strengthen all our forces to defend peace and prevent our country from being used as a base for attacking the Soviet Union, attacking People's Democratic countries, and all freedom-loving countries!

　　We pay our respects to the Soviet Union, the first bastion of peace, which has given protection to mothers and children!

　　We pay our respects to the women all over the world who are fighting for peace and the liberation of their countries!

　　We pay our respects to the Women's International Democratic Federation and thank it for its efforts!

　　Long live the unity of women all over the world in the struggle for peace and democracy!

　　Long live liberated China!

　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

　　叙利亚代表阿梅涅·阿莱夫发言
    【新华社北京十三日电】叙利亚妇女保护产妇与儿童联合会代表阿梅涅·阿莱夫，在亚洲妇女代表会议第三次会议上的发言摘要如下：
    世界各地的妇女们，都很快乐地来参加亚洲妇女代表会议。
    我们叙利亚妇女也和其他妇女一样地参加到她们的队伍里来了。我们要向全世界宣告：我们叙利亚妇女永远不允许帝国主义者将我们的国土变成侵略苏联和其他人民民主共和国家的基地！我们是从很遥远的地方来向把自己从帝国主义的魔掌下解放出来的、把国家变成和平堡垒的、胜利的中国人民致敬的。
    我们是来向苏联妇女致敬，来向人民民主的妇女们致敬的，她们是和平与民主斗争的先锋！
    对于帝国主义国家里的民主妇女，我们同样也要致敬，因为她们也同我们一道，在对帝国主义者作着斗争。
    我们来此，是想要你们诸位听一听叙利亚妇女的呼声，使你们了解她们是怎样为了自己的解放而与帝国主义者在斗争着。
    叙利亚人民痛恨美、英、法帝国主义者使他们受了许多痛苦。他们感到了苏联的友谊。因为苏联是各国人民的朋友，因为苏联的代表维辛斯基在联合国使用了否决权，才使英法军队从叙利亚撤退。
    “叙利亚妇女保护产妇与儿童联合会”是为着和平，为着国家的解放、保护母亲和儿童的权益而斗争的。这个组织遭受叙利亚先后当政的一切政府的压迫。它的主席沙卢娜本尼曾经被通缉，它的书记奥米沙沙可亚和四十一位会员曾经被逮捕和监禁。妇女们曾经组织过群众示威运动，要求释放全体被捕民主分子，停止纳粹式的野蛮行为，但没有成功，全体被捕的人曾举行绝食七天的斗争。这一运动曾经给在恐怖中的叙利亚人民以很大影响。在现政府统治下，我们这个团体也曾和其他许多民主团体举行过十月二日国际和平斗争日的示威运动。这一运动得到人民群众的很大响应。游行队伍经过街市时，群众都热烈表示赞同和拥护，警察也无法阻止。
    这个团体也曾集会庆祝国际妇女节，在贺么斯有过大规模的示威运动。游行者手执号召叙利亚妇女与全世界妇女团结起来，为反对帝国主义争取和平而斗争的标语，并击退警察的逮捕，达到向政府提出请愿书的目的。
    最后，我们要把叙利亚妇女的呼声和全世界妇女的呼声汇合起来高呼：我们不要战争！我们妇女和母亲的责任是增强我们一切力量以保卫和平，和阻止把我们的国家做为进攻苏联、进攻人民民主国家和一切爱自由的各国人民的基地！
    我们向和平的第一堡垒、已给予母亲与儿童们以保障的苏联致敬！
    我们向世界各国为着和平和她们的国家的解放而斗争的妇女们致敬！
    我们向国际民主妇联致敬，同时并感谢它的努力！
    全世界妇女为争取和平与民主团结万岁！
    解放的中国万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
