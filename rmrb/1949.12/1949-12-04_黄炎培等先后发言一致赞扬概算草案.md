Committee members Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Nanxian, Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Committee member Li Zhucheng, and Committee member Zhang Dongsun spoke in succession, unanimously praising this draft budget and agreeing with the proposal to issue public bonds. Committee member Huang Yanpei said that this budget is a truly honest budget. Based on the report by Vice Chairman Li Fuchun of the Northeast People's Government and what he himself saw of the rapid economic recovery in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, he optimistically believes that as long as everyone works hard, next year's income can increase more than the estimated budget. He supports the proposal to issue public bonds and calls on everyone to concentrate their efforts to promote the sale of these public bonds. Committee member Zhang Bojun expressed his complete agreement with the proposal to issue public bonds, believing that people from all democratic parties should earnestly and responsibly support the issuance of these public bonds, and especially conduct extensive publicity and mobilization among the people. In his speech, Committee member Zhang Nanxian believed that the People's Government's issuance of public bonds is a good way to solve the country's financial difficulties. In the past, from Yuan Shikai to the Kuomintang reactionaries, they made the issuance of public bonds a tool for speculation by bureaucratic capitalists, which was ultimately detrimental and harmful to the people. Now the People's Government's issuance of public bonds is beneficial to the country, the people, and those who purchase the bonds themselves, and the people will certainly support it very much. Vice Chairman Li Jishen pointed out that in the past, in the budgets of the Kuomintang reactionary government, even peacetime military expenditures accounted for 80 percent. Now, under the circumstances that the People's Government's large-scale military operations are still continuing, the estimated military expenditure only accounts for 38.8 percent, which is very commendable. Vice Chairman Li Jishen especially praised the great spirit of hard struggle, which is the tradition of the People's Liberation Army. Vice Chairman Li further pointed out that even in the peacetime budgets of the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past, there was no budget for economic construction expenditures, while we have an estimated 23.9 percent of economic construction expenditures under such difficult war circumstances today, which is even more commendable. Regarding public bonds, he hopes that everyone will work hard to complete and exceed the prescribed amount.

　　黄炎培等先后发言一致赞扬概算草案
    黄炎培委员、章伯钧委员、张难先委员、李济深副主席、李烛尘委员和张东荪委员等先后发言，一致赞扬这个概算草案，并且同意发行公债的提议。黄炎培委员说，这个概算是真正老实的预算。他根据东北人民政府李富春副主席的报告以及他自己所看到的北京、天津、上海等地经济迅速恢复的情形，乐观地认为只要大家努力，明年的收入还可以比概算的估计有增加。他赞成发行公债的提议，并且号召大家集中力量来推销这个公债。章伯钧委员表示完全赞成发行公债的提议，认为各民主党派人士应该认真负责地支持这个公债的发行，特别要向人民作广泛的宣传和动员。张难先委员在发言中认为人民政府发行公债是解决国家财政困难的一项好办法。过去从袁世凯到国民党反动派，他们使发行公债成为官僚资本家投机的工具，结果对人民无利有害。现在人民政府发行公债对国家人民和购买公债者本人都有利，人民一定都是非常拥护的。李济深副主席指出，在过去国民党反动政府的预算中，平时的军事支出也要占百分之八十。现在人民政府在大规模军事行动还在继续的情形下，军事支出概算只占百分之三十八点八，这是很难得的。李济深副主席特别赞扬人民解放军传统的艰苦奋斗的伟大精神。李副主席又指出，就是在过去国民党反动政府的平时预算中，也没有经济建设支出的预算，而我们在今天这样困难的战争情形下，还有百分之二十三点九的经济建设支出概算，更是难能可贵。关于公债，他希望大家努力完成并且超过规定的数额。
