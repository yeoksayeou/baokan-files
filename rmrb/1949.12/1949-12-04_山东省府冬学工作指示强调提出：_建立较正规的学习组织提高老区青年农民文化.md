　　Shandong Provincial Government's Winter Study Work Instructions Emphasize:
    Establishing More Formal Learning Organizations to Improve the Culture of Young Farmers in Old Liberated Areas
    [Our Newspaper] Shandong News: The Shandong Provincial People's Government recently issued instructions, calling on all localities to seize the slack farming season, carry out winter study work, and establish formal learning organizations. The instructions pointed out: In addition to universally carrying out current affairs education and democratic education throughout the province, each region should differentiate its educational guidelines and content based on different target audiences and needs: In newly liberated areas, in-depth education on policies such as rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and reasonable burden should be carried out; young male and female farmers in old liberated areas should earnestly learn literacy and cultural and scientific knowledge, while older and middle-aged people should focus on production education; the educational policy in disaster areas must unite production and disaster relief. Regarding the cultural learning of young people in old liberated areas, due to the needs of production and construction and the demands of farmers, especially young farmers, after land reform, the Provincial People's Government believes that this work must be organized with great attention. Therefore, it is required to consolidate and restore existing night schools and literacy classes, improve literacy groups, develop new people's schools, establish more concentrated and formal learning organizations, strengthen classroom teaching (stipulating that cultural courses account for four-fifths and political courses account for one-fifth), and group students according to cultural level and mass opinion, gradually establishing systems such as roll call, examination, and leave of absence, and generally stipulating that completing four volumes of farmer's cultural textbooks constitutes graduation. This winter, all young farmers entering school are required to finish reading one volume of farmer's cultural textbooks, and they must not only be able to read, write, speak, and use them, but also combine mass thinking in literacy learning to explain production, hygiene, and common sense of natural science.

　　山东省府冬学工作指示强调提出：
    建立较正规的学习组织提高老区青年农民文化
    【本报讯】山东消息：山东省人民政府顷发布指示，号召各地抓紧农闲季节，开展冬学工作，建立正规学习组织。指示指出：全省除应普遍进行时事教育与民主教育外，各地区在不同对象、不同需要的条件之下，教育方针与教育内容亦当有所区别：在新区，应深入进行减租减息，合理负担等政策教育；老区青年男女农民应切实学习识字、学习文化科学知识，老年壮年应注意生产教育；灾区教育方针，则必须团结生产救灾来进行。关于老区青年的文化学习问题，由于生产建设的需要及土地改革以后农民特别是青年农民的要求，省人民政府认为此一工作必须以极大的注意力来组织进行，因此就要求在现有基础上整顿与恢复原有的夜校识字班，提高识字小组，发展新的民校，建立比较集中正规的学习组织，加强课堂教学（规定文化课占五分之四，政治课占五分之一），依照文化程度及群众意见，编号分组，逐渐的建立点名、考试、请假等制度，并大体规定以学完四本农民文化课本为卒业。今年冬季，要求入学青年农民都能念完一本农民文化课本，并不仅要会念、会写、会讲、会用，而且要在学习识字中结合群众思想，讲解生产、卫生、自然科学常识。
