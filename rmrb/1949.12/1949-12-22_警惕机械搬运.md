　　Beware of Mechanical Handling
　　In the mass movement to create new records in Northeast China, comrades Zhang Shangju and Zhao Guoyou truly played a pioneering role for the working class. Now, the entire movement is advancing steadily, moving towards creating new and higher "technical norms" and "production standards," and comprehensively improving industrial production.

　　"A single spark can start a prairie fire." It is no accident that the slogan of creating new records in Northeast China could develop into a large movement involving hundreds of thousands of people. It is by no means a simple production competition or blitz, but rather the result of the maturity and sufficiency of the conditions in Northeast China. Northeast China has had a year of peaceful construction. It is rich in resources, has a large industrial base, and all transportation within the territory has been restored. State-owned enterprises have now, on average, restored 35 percent of the total production during the puppet Manchukuo period. The major factories and mines have successively mobilized workers to launch movements against waste, to inventory assets, and to make rationalization proposals. They have begun to implement economic accounting systems. As a result, production has developed rapidly, and the workers' awareness has been raised, creating conditions for the movement in all aspects. Thus, the creation of new records was imminent and became a truly mass-based, huge wave of production.

　　Some newly liberated cities have not yet completed the restoration of production order, and the objective and subjective conditions are not complete. It is worth considering whether it is wise to rashly propose a "New Record Creation Movement." A provincial newspaper once described a factory's New Record Creation Movement: "They can all leave early and arrive late, go without food for a day, and go without sleep for three days. Some comrades do not rest even when they are injured on duty..." This production enthusiasm is good, but if it is used as a driving force for the New Record Movement, it will not only be unsustainable, but it will also affect production, harm workers' health, waste tools and raw materials, and cause damage. Even in Northeast China, experience has shown that they still have to find the appropriate focus and typical demonstrations for the movement based on the specific circumstances and characteristics, rather than "movement for the sake of movement." This should arouse our vigilance.

　　警惕机械搬运
    在东北创新纪录的群众运动中，张尚举、赵国有两位同志真正起了工人阶级的先锋作用。现在，整个运动是在稳步地前进，它正朝着创造新的更高的“技术定额”与“生产标准”，全面提高工业生产的方向前进。
    　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    “星星之火可以燎原”，创纪录的口号在东北能够发展成为数十万人的大运动，这绝非偶然，也决不是一个简单的生产竞赛或突击，而是由于东北条件准备成熟和充分的结果。东北和平建设已有一年，资源丰富，工业基础大，境内交通全部恢复，国家企业目前平均已恢复到伪满时生产总量的百分之三十五。各主要厂矿先后发动职工，展开反浪费，清理资财，合理化建议等运动，开始实行经济核算制，因之生产迅速发展，工人觉悟提高，为运动创造了各方面的条件，创纪录也就一触即发，而成了真正群众性的生产巨大浪潮。
    　　　　　 ×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    有些新解放城市生产秩序尚未完成恢复，主客观条件均不完备，也贸然提出了“创新纪录运动”，这是值得考虑的，一个省的报纸曾这样描写某厂创新纪录运动道：他们都能够早走晚走，一天不吃饭，三天不睡觉，有的同志因公受伤也不休息……”这种生产热情是好的，但若把它当作新纪录运动来推动，则不但不会持久，而且会影响生产，妨害工人健康，浪费工具原料，造成损害的。即使在东北，经验证明，他们在运动中，仍然要根据具体情况与特点，找出运动恰当的重点，典型示范，而不是“为运动而运动”。这应引起我们警惕。
