Storatov's Speech at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Agricultural Biology Group
Translated by the Agricultural Biology Research Office of National Peking Agricultural University
Editor's Note: Storatov's speech reveals the struggle between two lines in the world of biology. It sharply criticizes Weismann and Morgan's fallacy of "nature being eternally不变," and promotes Michurin's theory of studying the laws of natural development and controlling nature. This has extremely important implications for current Chinese biological and agricultural sciences, and is hereby introduced.

	Content of the Debate Between the Michurin Line and the Weismann-Morgan Line

Lysenko's report, "The State of Biological Science," has already been translated into Chinese. My book, "The Basic Principles of Michurin Biology," I've been told, is being translated in Beijing and will be published soon. From these two books, one can comparatively understand the content of the debate in biological science. No matter how detailed this report may be, it is impossible to include all the materials of the debate. Therefore, I must only discuss important issues.

In biological science, for many years, biologists from two sides—the Michurin line and the Weismann-Morgan line—have been engaged in a sharp debate. The Michurin line is named after a great Russian biologist, Michurin (born in 1855, died in 1935), while the Weismann-Morgan line is named after the German biologist Weismann and the American biologist Morgan.

What is the difference between these two lines in biological science? To answer this question, it is necessary to introduce the content of the debate between these two lines.

In the debate, many specific issues in biological science were discussed, many of which were highly specialized. For example, agronomists first pay attention to wheat (self-pollinating plants). If a certain variety of wheat is cultivated in one place for a long time, will it change its original genetic traits? They also noticed what would happen if we planted two obviously different varieties of rye (cross-pollinating) on adjacent plots. Animal husbandry experts concerned with improving the quality of livestock breeds would first pay attention to what results would be obtained if cattle or pig breeds were subjected to inbreeding (brother-sister, father-daughter, mother-son mating). Biologists engaged in the study of general biological problems would first pay attention to whether a new variety could be obtained by grafting a branch of one variety onto the trunk or root of another variety, which would combine the traits and characteristics of these two different varieties. Issues such as these, both those raised above and those not yet raised, are the subject of debate in biological science. Although the issues discussed in the debate have a very specialized and specific nature, the debate in biological science has at least two characteristics. The first characteristic is the intensity and extreme sharpness of the debate, and the division of opinions is very clear. The second characteristic is the universal and widespread nature of the debate. Not only biologists are concerned about the debate, but also some intellectual strata who have no direct relationship with biological science.

Why does this debate have such characteristics? Because many of the specialized and specific issues discussed in the debate are actually based on a general worldview. In each specific issue in the debate, this general basis is fully and clearly expressed. It is also due to this general basis that the great divide between the two camps—two lines—in biological science is demarcated. What exactly is this general basis?

	Definition of the Purpose of Biological Science

The most general is the definition of the purpose of biological science.

What is the answer of the Michurin line to the question of the purpose of biological science? The answer of the Michurin line is very clear. The purpose of biological science—say the Michurinists—is to reveal the objective laws of development of the biological world (plants and animals). And, for the sake of human happiness, to use these laws to more effectively control nature. In other words, to increase the yield of crops and improve the quality of livestock. To create some plants that cannot be cultivated in certain places due to the natural environment, but are needed for human production activities, and to create livestock types that can more perfectly meet human needs. And to learn how to control nature—to prevent droughts and other natural disasters from cultivating plants. In simple terms, the purpose of biological science is to make mankind increasingly powerful in their struggle for survival by increasing their means of livelihood, and to make the lives of all mankind—not individual parts—more and more fulfilling and healthy. The Michurinists say that the purpose of biological science also includes exploring living conditions that can sustain human life, and exploring methods to alleviate or completely eliminate the pain that diseases inflict on mankind.

What is the answer of the Weismann-Morgan line to the question of the purpose of biological science? The Weismann-Morgan theorists themselves do not give a clear answer to this question. What is their real answer? To this, we can only guess. The fact of not answering the question specifically is not accidental. The Weismann-Morgan theorists cannot—they do not have the strength—to directly state their purpose. If they were to state their purpose straightforwardly, they would completely expose their reactionary true colors. However, from the content of the entire Weismann-Morgan theory, we can clearly know that the purpose, the ultimate goal, of the Weismann-Morgan line is to prove that nature is constant and unchanging, that everything on earth is eternally不变. That different ethnic groups in society are inherently unequal because they are born with superiority or inferiority, that humans have no power to understand the laws of nature, that poverty in the human world is due to the increase in population exceeding the means of livelihood that the earth can produce, and so on. Needless to say, how reactionary such a purpose is, how far the Weismann-Morgan theorists are from the true purpose of science, and that all their activities are serving the dark and reactionary forces.

	The Heredity of Animals and Plants Can Be Changed

For many general issues in biological science, the Michurinists and Weismann theorists have different answers, just as they do on the issue of purpose. Now let's discuss a few of these issues.

The first question is whether heredity—the heredity of plant and animal species—can be changed? The Michurinists answer this question very clearly: the heredity of plant and animal species can be changed. Every variety of cultivated plant cultivated by humans changes over time, and every variety of livestock raised by humans inevitably changes over time.

The Weismann-Morgan theorists' answer to this question is exactly the opposite. They say that if two different varieties of plants do not cross—if each variety maintains pure-line breeding—then the heredity of this plant variety cannot be changed. If a pure-line breeding of a certain variety of livestock is maintained—using livestock of the same variety to mate with each other—then the heredity of this variety will not change.

So, to which side should scientific truth belong? To answer this question, it is necessary to look at the actual activities in human history. History tells us that over time, certain varieties of plants and certain varieties of animals disappear, while others new varieties arise to replace them. This is the result of changes in the heredity of plant and animal varieties. Certain plant types and animal types die out—disappear—due to old age, and new plant types and animal types appear on the original basis to replace them. In practice, the variation process takes a long time, extending to many years, so it is sometimes difficult to observe. Applying scientific methods to conduct experiments can greatly shorten the long time process of variation, and it can be observed in a short time frame—the process of three to five generations of plants or animals. Michurin biologists have accumulated a lot of empirical evidence in this area. Natural realities and scientific experiments have proved that scientific truth belongs to Michurin biology.

	Improving Living Conditions Can Change Heredity

The second question is: What force changes the heredity of animals and plants? The Michurin biologists answer this question very clearly: the change in the heredity of plants and animals is the result of living conditions affecting the organism. When living conditions change, heredity inevitably changes as well. If we take a certain plant variety and cultivate it under different living environmental conditions, after many generations, then according to the combination of many different living conditions, we can obtain two or three or more varieties from this variety; if we keep the living conditions of a certain animal variety or plant variety relatively unchanged, then this animal variety or plant variety can also maintain a relatively unchanged state. If we take a very good—excellent livestock breed and raise it under poor and bad conditions, this livestock breed will become a poor—bad breed. Conversely, if we improve the conditions for raising livestock generation after generation—improve the conditions for raising, then this livestock will become better and better generation after generation, and the quality will be improved.

The Weismann-Morgan theorists can be said to not address the second question—that is, what force changes heredity—at all. Because they basically deny the variability of heredity. (But this was before the Michurinists—the materialist biologists—criticized the Weismann-Morgan theorists.) When the facts accumulated by the Michurin biologists proved it, the Weismann-Morgan theorists had to admit the variability of heredity, but even though they admitted it, they still had many reservations, which are not worth paying attention to. What is worth paying attention to is that after the Weismann-Morgan theorists admitted the variability of heredity, they had to answer the question about the causes of variability. In answering this question, they exposed the reactionary nature of their worldview. The Weismann-Morgan theorists declare that humans cannot know the reasons why heredity varies. This concept of "unknowability" is one of the most reactionary concepts in philosophy. They say that human understanding of nature is limited, and that humans have no power to increasingly deeply understand—reveal—the laws of nature. Such a concept dooms people to a fate of shrinking back and makes people incompetent. This is not a scientific concept. The entire development of scientific knowledge proves that people go from not knowing to knowing. What people did not know yesterday may become known today, and what is not known today can be known tomorrow. On this basis, our knowledge is accumulated generation after generation. This is what science is like, and this is how science develops and spreads.

The essence of the third question is as follows: Can a plant or an animal develop new traits and new characteristics under the influence of living conditions, and can these traits and characteristics be inherited by the next generation? Michurin biology answers this question very positively: Yes, it can. Under the influence of changing living conditions, plants and animals, corresponding to these changes in living conditions, can not only but must develop new traits and new characteristics, and they must be inherited by the next generation. Without this phenomenon, there would be no transformation from one type of organism to other new types of organisms in nature. The Weismann-Morgan theorists answer the above question in the negative. They say that plants and animals cannot inherit the new traits or characteristics they acquire under the influence of living conditions to the next generation. Such a denial ultimately leads the Morgan theorists to deny the development of nature, and thus deny that one type of organism can be transformed into another type of organism.

	Humans Can Create Animal and Plant Types According to Goals

The essence of the fourth question is another explanation of the third question, and it is applied to agricultural production. This question can be raised in this way: Can we create plant types and animal types according to certain plans and goals, so that these plant types and animal types can better meet our requirements than existing types? Michurin biology gives a positive answer to this question: Yes, we can. Not only does it give a positive answer, but it has also been proven in practical work and experiments. From the many facts mastered by the Michurin biologists, we present a few examples: Among all the winter wheat types in the world, experiments have shown that none of them can withstand the severe winter in Siberia. The Michurin breeders in the Soviet Union created a new type of winter wheat that can not only safely resist the severe winter in Siberia, but also develop normally and healthily there. Under the environmental conditions of the Moscow region, grapes have never been grown, and no grape type can survive the winter in the Moscow region and bear fruit there in the summer. The Michurin breeders successfully created a new grape type that can safely overwinter in the climate conditions of Moscow and also have a high yield. In the whole world—wild and cultivated—there has never been cotton with naturally colored fibers. When this cotton was needed in actual production, the Michurin breeders in the Soviet Union successfully created this cotton that met the needs. We don't need to list such facts anymore. The more we go on, the more such facts will be accumulated in science in the future. These facts all prove that humans have the power to create the plant types and animal types we need according to goals and plans. The Weismann-Morgan theorists deny this possibility. Their denial is not because they grasp any true facts. Rather, it is because their entire worldview—all their theoretical principles—does not allow them to admit that humans have the possibility of controlling living beings. Michurin biology encourages the courage of researchers, cultivates their daring and creative spirit, and their unwavering pursuit of truth. As for Weismann biology, it reflects the bourgeois outlook on life, dooming people to a passive fate and making them very docilely bow to nature.

	The Most Important Difference Between the Two Lines—Whether a Plant Species or Animal Species Can Be Transformed Into Another Plant Species or Animal Species

We don't need to list every specific issue in the biological science debate one by one. The above materials are enough to make us clear about the important fundamental difference in essence between Michurin and Weismann-Morgan biology. So I will describe this part of the report.

Modern physics and chemistry have reached a very high level in understanding the laws of development of the inanimate world. Just mentioning the achievements in atomic separation is enough. In the early 20th century, scholars had already proved that the atoms of radium can be split into atoms of helium, and later research on helium knew that it could also be separated into atoms of many other elements. For example, because of the splitting of atoms, phosphorus atoms can be changed into sulfur atoms, and nitrogen atoms can be changed into carbon atoms. In the inanimate world, the transformation of one form of matter into another is now explained by transforming one basic element into another. In the biological world, then, a question arises: Can a living form of matter be transformed into another living form of matter? In the biological world, there are certain plant species and animal species. We want to ask: Can one plant species be transformed into another plant species? Can one animal species be transformed into another animal species? Michurin biology answers: Yes, it is possible. Weismann-Morgan biology answers: No, it is not possible. This is the most important difference between the two lines in biology.

One species can be transformed into another, and the Michurin biologists' answer is based on correct experimental facts. Now every researcher can use the methods of Michurin biology to transform winter types (sown before winter) of plants such as wheat and rye into spring types (sown in spring). There are many kinds of wheat, and now every researcher can use the Michurin method to transform one kind into another. The basis of this method is to change living conditions. Changes in the living conditions required by a certain plant cause changes in the plant's traits.

	The More Living Beings, the More Livelihood Materials Can Be Created

Now the level of development reached by Michurin biology is already able to transform wheat into rye. They know what forces influence this transformation. In the near future, biology will implement this transformation as accurately as chemistry transforms one element into another. In the near future, there is no doubt that biology will be able to discover methods to change other plant species into another species. Such a transformation has already been proven experimentally. Michurin biology is also striving to confirm such a change. The purpose of Michurin biology is to raise biology to the same high level as physics and chemistry today. In the future, biology will reach such a level, there is no doubt about it.

There is also a great principled difference between the Michurin side and the Weismann-Morgan side in biological science. This difference is as follows: The starting point of the Weismann-Morgan theorists is that the number of organisms produced in the biological world is far greater than the food that the earth can possibly supply. In other words, their view is that the number of living beings produced in the world exceeds the conditions necessary for their survival. Our—the Michurinists'—view is exactly the opposite. We assert that the more living beings the earth produces, the more livelihood materials can be created. One living being creates living conditions for other living beings. This assertion is also based on empirical evidence. For example, it is an undeniable fact that the fertility of the soil where plants grow is created by the plants themselves. Therefore, the more plants grow, the more they can increase the fertility of the soil where they grow. Soil without plant growth is quickly destroyed—it loses its fertility. If life stops in a certain place, then the living conditions necessary for life there must also disappear at the same time.

　　生物科学中的论战
    斯托拉托夫在中苏友好总会农业生物学组演讲
    国立北京农业大学农业生物研究室译
    编者按：斯托拉托夫的这篇讲演，揭示了世界生物学界两条路线的斗争，尖锐地批驳了魏斯曼、莫尔干“自然是永恒不变”的谬说，发扬了米邱林关于研究自然发展规律并控制自然的学说，这对当前中国生物科学农业科学有极重要的启示作用，特介绍于此。
    　　　　米邱林路线与魏斯曼、莫尔干路线论战的内容
    李森科的报告——“生物科学状况”，已经有中文译本，我所著的“米邱林生物学的基本原理”一书，据有人告诉我，北京已经有人正在翻译，不久就可以出版。由以上二本书，能够比较的了解生物科学中论战的内容。在这个报告内，无论怎样详尽，也不可能包括所有论战的材料。因之，我就不得不仅仅对于重要问题加以讨论。
    生物科学中，许多年以来，两个方面——米邱林路线和魏斯曼、莫尔干路线——的生物学者们进行尖锐的论战。米邱林路线是由一个伟大俄罗斯生物学家——米邱林（一八五五年生一九三五年死）而得名的，魏斯曼、莫尔干路线的命名是由于它产生于德国生物学家魏斯曼和美国生物学家莫尔干。
    生物科学中这两个路线的区别是什么呢？要回答这个问题，必需要介绍这二个路线论战的内容？
    在论战中，曾讨论了许多生物科学中的具体问题，其中有不少是很专门化的问题，比方：农艺学者们首先注意小麦（自花授粉的植物），在一个地方长期的栽培小麦某一品种，它是否改变原来的遗传性状呢？也注意到，如果我们在相连的小区上，栽种二个显然不同的黑麦（异花授粉）品种，会发生什么样的事情呢？关心改良家畜种的品质的畜牧家们，就会首先注意如果用牛种或者猪种，实行近亲繁殖（兄妹、父女、母子交配）便会得到什么样的结果呢？从事一般生物学问题研究的生物学家们，就首先注意，由于一个品种的枝条嫁接到另一个品种的树干或根上，能否得到一个新的品种，而是结合这两个不同品种的性状和特征呢？诸如此类的一些问题，以上所提出的和还没有提出的专门问题，都是生物科学中论战的主题。虽然在论战中所讨论的问题具有很专门化、具体化的性质，但是生物科学中的论战，至少有二个特点，第一个特点是论战的剧烈和极端尖锐化，争论的分野是极明显的。第二个特点是论战的普遍广泛性。关心论战的不仅是生物学家，而且有些是对于生物科学没有直接关系的知识分子阶层。
    这个论战为什么有这样的特征呢？因为论战所讨论的许多专门的具体的问题，实际是以一般性的世界观为基础的。在论战中每一个具体问题上，充分明显的表现这一般性的基础，也由于这一般性的基础，划分了生物科学中两大阵营——两个路线的鸿沟。这一般性的基础到底是什么呢？
    　　　　对生物科学目的底定义
    最富于一般性的就是对于生物科学目的底定义。
    对于生物科学的目的，这个问题，米邱林路线作什么样的答复呢？米邱林路线的答复是很明确的。生物科学的目的——米邱林论者们说——是揭发生物界（植物和动物）发展的客观规律。并且为了人类的幸福，利用这些规律来更有效的控制自然。换句话说，使农作物的产量得以增高，家畜的质量得以改进。来创造某些地方为自然环境所不能培栽的，而为人类生产活动所需要的一些植物，创造能够更完善的满足人类需要的家畜型。并且学习能够控制自然——防止旱灾和其他自然界中的灾害去栽培植物。简单的说：生物科学的目的是使人类在他们增加生活资料的生存斗争中变得愈来愈富强，使全人类——不是个别的部分——的生活，过得越来越美满、越健康。米邱林论者们说生物科学的目的，也包括探求能够维持人类生命的生活条件，并且探求方法以减轻或者完全消灭疾病所给人类的痛苦。
    魏斯曼、莫尔干路线，对于生物科学目的问题作怎样的答复呢？魏斯曼、莫尔干论者们自己对这个问题，不作明确的答复，他们的真实的答复是什么呢？对于这个，我们只好去猜测了。这样的不具体答复问题的事实，并不是偶然的。魏斯曼、莫尔干论者们不能够——他们没有力量——直接的说出他们的目的。如果直捷了当的说出来他们的目的，那么，他们就会完全暴露自己的反动真面目了。但是由魏斯曼、莫尔干整个学说的内容，我们就可以很清楚的知道魏斯曼、莫尔干路线的目的，最后目标是证明——自然是恒久不动的，在地球上的一切，是永恒不变的。在社会上不同的民族，本来就是不平等的，因为他们天生就有优劣性，人没有力量认识自然规律，认为人间的贫穷是由于人口的增加，超过地球所能生产的生活资料，如此等等。不用说这样的目的，是多反动，魏斯曼、莫尔干论者们离开真正科学的目的是多么远，以及他们的一切活动，都是为着那黑暗的反动势力而服务效劳的。
    　　　　动植物的遗传是会改变的
    对于生物科学中许多一般性的问题，也是和目的方面的立场一样，米邱林论者和魏斯曼论者也是有不同的答复。现在我们来讨论这样的几个问题。
    第一个问题就是遗传性——植物种和动物种——是否改变？米邱林论者回答这个问题是十分清楚的，植物遗传性和动物遗传性是改变的。人类所栽种的栽培植物，每一个品种在时间的过程中都在改变，人类所饲育的家畜，每一个品种在时间的过程中，也不可避免的在改变。
    魏斯曼、莫尔干论者，对于这个问题的答复，是恰恰相反的，他们说：如果两个不同品种的植物不发生杂交——如果保持每一个品种的纯系繁殖——那么这个植物品种的遗传性就不能改变。如果保持某一品种家畜纯系的饲育——用同一品种的家畜互相交配，那么这一个品种的遗传性就不改变。
    于是科学的真理，究竟应该属于那一方面呢？要回答这个问题，必需看看人类历史上的实际活动。历史告诉我们，在时间的过程中，某些植物的品种，某些动物的品种是要消失的，而另外又产生些新的品种来代替，这是植物品种和动物品种的遗传性改变的结果。某些植物型和动物型由于老衰而死灭——消失，而在原来的基础上，起而代之的，是新的植物型和动物型出现。在实际上变异过程是需要很长的时间，延长到许多年，因之有时候很难得观察到的。在应用科学方法举行实验，可以大量的缩短变异的长久时间过程，能够在很短的时间阶段上——植物或动物三五代的过程——就能观察着的。米邱林生物学者们，在这一方面已经累积了不少的实证。自然的实际情形和科学实验都证明了，科学真理是属于米邱林生物学的。
    　　　　改良生活条件就可以改变遗传
    第二个问题是什么力量改变动物和植物的遗传性呢？米邱林生物学者回答这个问题是很清楚的，植物和动物的遗传性的改变是由于生活条件影响有机体的结果。当生活条件有了改变，遗传性就不可避免的也要改变。如果我们取某一个植物品种，栽培在不同生活环境条件下，经过许多子代的过程，那么按照许多不同生活条件的组合，我们就可以从这个品种得到两三个或者更多的品种；如果使某一个动物品种或植物品种的生活条件保持相当不变的情况，于是这个动物品种或植物品种也能保持相当不变的状态。如果我们拿一个很好的——优良家畜种，而在不好的恶劣条件下饲养，这个家畜种就要变为不好的——恶劣种。相反的如果我们一代一代的改良饲育家畜的条件——改良饲养的条件，那这家畜就会一代一代的变好，品质都会改良。
    魏斯曼、莫尔干论者对于第二个问题——就是什么力量改变遗传性的问题——可以说是似乎不存在的。因为他们基本上连遗传的变异性也都要否认的。（但是在米邱林论者——唯物论的生物学者们——批判魏斯曼、莫尔干论以前的事。）当由于米邱林生物学者们所累积的事实证明之下，魏斯曼、莫尔干论者们已经不得不承认遗传性的变异性，可是，他们虽然是承认，仍然有许多保留的，这还不值得重视，值得注意的是另一方面，就是魏斯曼、莫尔干论者既然承认遗传的变异性以后，就不得不回答关于变异性原因的问题。由于答复这个问题，就暴露了他们世界观的反动面目。魏斯曼、莫尔干论者们宣称：人是无法知道遗传性所以变异的原因。这种“不可知”的观念是哲学中最反动的观念之一。他们说：人对于自然的认识要受限制的，人没有力量能够越来越深刻的了解——揭发——自然规律。这样的观念给人们注定畏缩不前的命运，使人们变得无能，这不是科学的观念，一切科学知识的整个发展是证明人们从没有认识而进到有认识，昨天人们还不知道的事情，今天已经可能变得知道，今天不知道的，明天就可以知道，在这个基础上，我们的知识就这样一代一代的累积着的。科学就是这样的，科学也是这样发展和推广的。
    第三个问题的要点如下：在生活条件的影响下，一个植物或者一个动物，能否发生新的性状，新的特征，这性状和特征能否遗传给下代？米邱林生物学答复这个问题是很肯定的，是的，能够的；在改变生活条件的影响下，植物和动物相当于这些生活条件的改变，不仅可以而且一定需要发生新的性状，新的特征，并且是要遗传给下代的。如果没有这种现象，自然界内也就不会从一个有机体型转变到另一些新的有机体型。魏斯曼、莫尔干论者，对上面这个问题，答复是否定的。他们说植物和动物在生活条件影响下，是不能把所获得的新的性状或特征遗传给下代的。这样的否认，最后引到莫尔干论者否认自然界的发展，也就否认了一种有机体型可能转变为另一种有机体型。
    　　　　人类可以按照目标创造动植物型
    第四个问题的本质，也就是第三个问题的另一种说明，而应用到农业生产方面。这个问题可以这样提出：我们能否按照一定的计划和目标去创造植物型和动物型，使这些植物型和动物型能够比现有的类型，还更完善的满足我们的要求。米邱林生物学，对于这个问题作肯定的答复：是的，能够的。不仅只作肯定的答复，而且在实际工作上和实验上都有了证明。我们从米邱林生物学者们所掌握的许多事实中，提出几个实例：在全世界所有的冬种小麦型中，根据实验证明，没有一个类型能够抵抗西伯利亚的寒冬。苏联的米邱林选种者创造了新的小麦冬种型，不仅能够很安全的抵抗西伯利亚的寒冬，而且是正常的在那里很健全的发育。在莫斯科区域的环境条件下，一向是没有生长过葡萄的，也没有一种葡萄型能够越过莫斯科区域的冬季，在夏季在那里能够结实。米邱林选种者成功的创造了新的葡萄型，这种新的葡萄型能够在莫斯科的气候条件下安全过冬，而且收获量也很高。在全世界上——野生的和栽培的——一向就没有自然颜色纤维的棉花，当实际生产上需要这种棉花的时候，苏联的米邱林选种者就创造成功这合乎需要的棉花。我们不必再例举这样的事实，越往后，科学上将来会累积更多象这样的事实。这些事实都是证明，人是有力量，按照目标和计划创造我们所需要的植物型和动物型。魏斯曼、莫尔干论者否认这种可能性。他们如此的否认，并不是他们把握着什么真真的事实。而是因为他们整个世界观——他们的理论上所有原则——都不允许承认人是有可能控制生物的。米邱林生物学是鼓励研究工作者的勇气，培养他们敢作敢为的创造精神和坚定不移的追求真理。至于魏斯曼生物学是反映着资产阶级的人生观，使人们注定了消极的命运，使人们很驯服的向着自然低头。
    　　　　两个路线的最重要的区别——能与不能把一个植物种或动物种变为
    　　另一个植物种或动物种
    我们不必一一的提出，关于生物科学论战中每一个具体问题，上述的材料已经足够使我们弄清楚米邱林和魏斯曼、莫尔干生物学之间，在本质上有一个很重要的基本区别。于是我来叙述这报告的这一部分。
    现在的物理学和化学对于认识无生物界的发展规律方面，已经达到很高的水准，只提出原子分离的成就，就很够了。在廿世纪的初叶，学者们已经证明镭的原子可能分裂为氦的原子，以后研究氦知道还可以分离成许多其他元素的原子。比方，因为原子的分裂，便可以将磷的原子变为硫磺的原子，氮素的原子可变为炭的原子。在无生物界内一种物质形态变为另一种物质形态，现在已经用一个基本元素变成为另一基本元素来说明的。在生物界内，于是发生一个问题，能否将一个有生命的物质形态，改变为另一个生命的物质形态呢？在生物界内，是有一定的植物种和动物种。我们要问能否将一个植物种变为另一个植物种呢？一个动物种变为另一个动物种呢？米邱林生物学答复说：是的，可能的。魏斯曼、莫尔干生物学却答复说：不，不可能的。这就是生物学内两个路线的最重要的区别。
    一个种可能改变为另一种，米邱林生物学者这样的回答，是根据正确的实验事实的。现在每一个研究者都能够利用米邱林生物学的方法，将冬种型（冬季前播种的）的小麦黑麦等植物改变为春种型（春季播种的）。小麦是有好多种，而现在每一个研究者能够用米邱林的方法将一个种变为另一个种。这方法的基础，就是改变生活条件，某种植物所需要的生活条件有了改变，就引起植物性状的改变。
    　　　　生物越多越能创造生活资料
    现在米邱林生物学所达到的发展水准，已经能够将小麦变成黑麦，他们知道这个转变是由于什么力量的影响所完成的。在不久的将来，生物学实行这一种转变也会象化学将一个元素转变为另一个元素那样正确。在不久的将来，毫无疑问的，生物学能够发现使其他植物的种改变为另一个种的方法。这样的转变在实验上已经证明了。米邱林生物学也就是为证实这样改变而奋斗，米邱林生物学的目的是使生物学提高到今天的物理学和化学那样高的水准。将来生物学是要达到这样的水准的，是毫无疑问的。
    生物科学内米邱林方面和魏斯曼、莫尔干方面之间，还有很大的原则上的区别，这个区别如下：魏斯曼、莫尔干论者的出发点，认为生物界内所产生的有机体数量，比地球上可能供给的食料要多得太多。换一句话说：他们的观点就是认为世界上所产生和生物，超过他们生存所要具备的条件。我们——米邱林论者——的观点，是恰恰相反的来看这个问题。我们断言地球的生物越产生得多。越能创造更多的生活资料。一个生物为其他生物创造生活条件。这个断言也是有实证的。比方，已经不可否认的事实，生长植物的土壤，他的肥力是由植物本身所创造的。于是植物生长越多，越能够增高生长植物的土壤的肥力，没有植物生长的土壤，很快的就毁坏了——消失它的肥力，如果某一个地方的生活都停止，于是在那里的生活必需条件也必定同时也消灭了。
