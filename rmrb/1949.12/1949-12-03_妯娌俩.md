Two Sisters-in-Law

　　Jin Gui and Yin Gui, these two brothers were not at home. Jin Gui was working in the district, and Yin Gui was a primary school teacher in the county. At home were only Jin Gui's wife, Yin Gui's wife, and Jin Gui's child, Xiao Chou. Everyone said: Jin Gui's wife and Yin Gui's wife were very good! Just like real sisters, they never argued. The two sisters-in-law were quite young; Jin Gui's wife was twenty-six years old this year, and Yin Gui's wife was two years younger than her sister-in-law. The two young wives helped each other, busy all day long making soles, spinning thread…, each trying to get ahead of the other, and both were production models in the group. With the men not at home, the two sisters-in-law supported the family, and life was easy and happy.

　　However, these two good sisters-in-law suddenly had a conflict. Jin Gui's wife said, "Sooner or later we will have to separate, so it's better to separate early and be done with it, each eating their own and saving trouble." Yin Gui's wife also shouted, "Separate then! Anyway, who is afraid of not being able to live without whom!" Neighbors asked them why they wanted to separate when they were getting along so well! They were both silent.

　　It so happened that one evening, Yin Gui returned from school. As soon as he entered the door, he asked his wife strangely, "Why did you move the fire inside when it's not cold yet?" Yin Gui's wife was pulling the bellows to start the fire, the room was full of smoke, stinging her eyes so much that she wanted to cry, and her head and shoulders were covered in soot. She was starting the fire while grumbling, "This fire is really annoying!" Looking up, she saw her husband standing in front of her, and after hesitating for a while, she said, "If I don't move it inside, what am I supposed to do!" Yin Gui wanted to find Jin Gui to discuss something, so he didn't bother to argue with his wife and asked, "Is my older brother home?" "I don't know!" Yin Gui's wife said, rubbing her eyes. Yin Gui then walked towards his sister-in-law's room, and before he even entered, he shouted, "Is my older brother there?" But as soon as he entered, he was immediately stunned. There was also a stove fire in his sister-in-law's room. Jin Gui's wife was putting rice into the pot, which was bubbling vigorously. She turned her head and saw that it was Yin Gui, and said, "He hasn't been back these days." "Uncle, Uncle." Xiao Chou was crawling on the kang, stretching out his small hands and shouting loudly. Yin Gui walked to the edge of the kang, hugged his little nephew and kissed him several times. Because Jin Gui was not at home, he came out.

　　The courtyard was very quiet. Yin Gui looked at the shed where the fire used to be, now empty, and felt a little puzzled: Why did they move the fire inside, why did they start two fires, what were they up to? Later, he quickly figured it out, and he walked from the courtyard to his own room.

　　Yin Gui's wife had already cooked the meal and was sitting by the stove waiting to eat. "Tell me, why are you cooking with two fires?" Yin Gui asked, walking to the stove. Yin Gui's wife looked up, smiled娇里娇气, tilted her head, and twisted her body without saying anything, but changed the subject: "Eat some of the ready-made food!" Yin Gui shook his head, squatted down on the chair facing the door, and after a while, Yin Gui's wife couldn't hold back anymore: "It's not convenient to eat from one pot, whether it's good or bad. My sister-in-law wants to separate, so that no one is taken advantage of by anyone else?" When Yin Gui heard this, he realized that they had really separated and said, "What about the money you earn from production in the future?" "Each person does their own work, earns their own money, and eats their own food!" Yin Gui's wife said bluntly, "Sooner or later, we have to go down this path." Yin Gui listened, knowing that they were having a quarrel, and asked again, "What is it really about?" "What is it about!" Yin Gui's wife puffed out her small mouth and said angrily, "Mother-in-law doesn't care anymore, and now there's a sister-in-law. Humph!" When Yin Gui saw his wife bring up that matter again, he explained to her: "I told you, that day's matter is no one's fault, it's just that I said a few careless words."

　　A few days ago, Yin Gui came back from school. Jin Gui's wife was patching the wall in the courtyard, sweating profusely, and there were many mud spots on her clothes. Yin Gui asked, "Did the wall collapse?" "It collapsed a little bit, it's fine to patch it up!" Jin Gui's wife said, wiping sweat with her sleeve while panting. Yin Gui asked again, "Why are you the only one doing it＠呢?" As he spoke, he rolled up his sleeves and helped her with everything from fetching water to mixing mud to ＠. Jin Gui's wife was very happy to see Yin Gui working so enthusiastically. Because she was happy, she started talking more, "After a rain, the wall collapsed, I couldn't take care of it with the child, and it's been delayed until today. Xiao Chou's aunt has been staying at her mother's house for these days and hasn't come back yet. Our family has been quite busy these days, and things are all piled up." Jin Gui's wife looked at Yin Gui and continued unintentionally, "Xiao Chou's aunt is good at everything, but she likes to stay away……." She had only said half of her words when she heard: "Sister-in-law, you're busy!" It turned out that Yin Gui's wife had come back with a small package and saw her husband and sister-in-law ＠the wall, so she greeted them, but she didn't hear them say anything. Yin Gui helped his sister-in-law quickly＠the wall and then took a rest.

　　Yin Gui returned to his own room and asked his wife, "If you have nothing to do in the future, stay at home more." Yin Gui's wife explained to her husband, "My mother is sick, so I stayed there for a few more days." In fact, it would have been better if she hadn't said anything after this point. Yin Gui was a straightforward person and had never been able to keep a secret. He told her everything that Jin Gui's wife had just said. This time, Yin Gui's wife got a little angry: "If you have something to say, say it face to face. Humph! I hate people who secretly gossip behind people's backs." Yin Gui's wife turned her face away from her husband, as if she had suffered a great grievance, so angry that she wanted to cry. When Yin Gui saw that something was wrong, he knew that his wife was overthinking again, walked over, patted her shoulder, and said, "Don't be suspicious, sister-in-law didn't say anything." Yin Gui's wife was a competitive person, and she usually rushed to do things between sisters-in-law, not wanting to give others a handle—few sisters-in-law get along well together. In order to compete for this face, Yin Gui's wife always worked ahead of others and ate after others; she also handed over the money she earned from production to her sister-in-law. Today, after hearing what her husband said, she had several problems in her heart, always feeling that her sister-in-law must have said something to her husband behind her back, and she really felt uncomfortable. Facing the wall, she cried sadly for a while, her shoulders twitching slightly, and her eyes filled with tears. Yin Gui quickly handed her a towel and asked her to wipe her tears, but she ignored him. Yin Gui personally wiped her tears for her, smiling and saying, "You really have the temper of a child, crying as soon as you say so." "I can eat, but I can't stand being angry!" Yin Gui's wife said, sobbing.

　　Yin Gui said, "It's not good to always be together and pick on each other." "If it doesn't work, then separate." Yin Gui's wife had never said such things before; at this time, she was like a madwoman, saying "separate" left and right, and Yin Gui kept saying good things.

　　The night was very quiet. Jin Gui's wife was putting Xiao Chou to sleep in her room, and she was sitting under the lamp making soles. Today, she had no other work to do, so she had been taking care of the child, and she hadn't had time all day to go to the factory to get work. She couldn't help but think of Yin Gui's wife's goodness. If it were in the past, Yin Gui's wife would have run to bring the work over. At this time, she began to blame herself for the fact that Yin Gui's wife had said "separate" that night, and she felt bad about it. But usually she was not that kind of尖薄 woman! The more Jin Gui's wife thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt, and her heart was chaotic, as if it was stuffed with a handful of firewood. "Sister-in-law, why did you separate to eat, it's more convenient together." Yin Gui said as soon as he entered the room. Jin Gui's wife raised her head, looked at Yin Gui, cracked her mouth, and smiled unnaturally, her eyes staring straight ahead, showing an awkward look. Yin Gui sat on the edge of the kang, saw that Xiao Chou was sleeping soundly, and lowered his voice, saying, "Sister-in-law, let's still be together, it's not good to separate at home when there are only two of you. You are both very active in production, it's more convenient to discuss things together, and besides, it's not good if you are not united, it will have a bad impact!" Yin Gui kept talking, and Jin's wife kept listening.

　　In Jin Gui's wife's room, Jin Gui's wife, Yin Gui, and Yin Gui's wife were sitting, and the three of them were holding a family meeting. Jin Gui's wife said first, "The street is mobilizing women to help each other in production, and even we two sisters-in-law can't help each other, it's really laughable, it's all my fault for having a bad temper." Yin Gui's wife also admitted her mistake: "It's not your fault, it's my fault for being小性多." As she spoke, she glanced at her husband, meaning to blame her husband for talking about that tasteless thing that night. Yin Gui was very happy to see that his two sisters-in-law had reconciled.

　　The next morning, Jin Gui's wife and Yin Gui's wife were sitting in the courtyard doing work as usual. Jin Gui's wife said, "Let's move the fire back to the courtyard, it's too hot to stand it in the house." Yin Gui's wife said, "One fire is just right under the shed." The two sisters-in-law were talking and laughing, talking about life, talking about production, and they seemed like a pair of real sisters again.

　　妯娌俩
    翟树雷
    金桂和银桂，这亲哥儿俩都不在家。金桂在区里工作，银桂在县里当小学教员。家里只有金桂媳妇、银桂媳妇和金桂的孩子小臭。人人都说：金桂媳妇和银桂媳妇可好着哩！就象亲姐妹似的，从来没有闹过意见。妯娌俩都挺年轻；金桂媳妇今年二十六岁，银桂媳妇比嫂嫂小两岁。两个年轻媳妇你帮着我、我帮着你，成天价忙着纳底子呀、纺线线啊……，一个赛似一个往前头跑着干，她们俩在组里都是生产模范。男人们不在家，她们妯娌俩支撑着家务，日子过的倒也轻松愉快。
    可是，这样好的妯娌俩突然闹上了矛盾。金桂媳妇说：“早晚也是要分开，不如趁早分开痛快，各人吃各人的省心。”银桂媳妇也嚷嚷着：“分开就分开呗！横竖谁离了谁还怕不能过哩！”邻居们问她们在一块好好的，为什么要分开呢！她们都不啃气。
    可巧，这天傍黑，银桂从学校里回来。一进门就挺奇怪的问他媳妇：“怎么天还不冷就把火挪到屋里来？”银桂媳妇正在拉风匣生火，屋里满都是烟，熏得她眼里直想流泪，头上肩上满都是烟灰，她一边生火、一边唠叨着：“这火真气死人哪！”抬头一看，丈夫站在面前，迟疑了半天才说：“不挪到屋里怎么办！”银桂因为要找金桂商量点事儿，顾不得和他媳妇纠缠，便问：“大哥在家没有？”“不知道！”银桂媳妇揉着眼睛说。银桂便向嫂嫂的房里走去，还没进门便嚷着问：“大哥在吗？”可是，他一进门马上就怔住了，嫂嫂屋里也生着一炉火。金桂媳妇正往锅里下米，锅开的鼓动鼓动的，她扭回头来，看见是银桂，便说：“他这几天老没有回来。”“叔叔，叔叔。”小臭在炕上爬着，张着小手大声的喊着。银桂走到炕边，抱住小侄子亲了几个嘴。因为金桂不在家，就出来了。
    院里挺肃静的，银桂看看从前生火的棚子正空空的，心里有点纳闷：她们为啥把火挪到屋里，为啥生两炉火，玩什么把戏？后来很快想通了，他从院里走到自己屋里。
    银桂媳妇已经把饭做好了，坐在炉台边等着吃饭。“我说，你们为哈生两火做饭呢？”银桂走到炉台边问着。银桂媳妇仰着头，娇里娇气的笑了笑，歪着脖儿扭捏着不说，却拐了个弯：“现成的饭吃点吧！”银桂摇摇头，一屁股蹲在冲门的椅子上，呆了一会，银桂媳妇却沉不住气了：“一个锅头吃饭不方便，吃好吃坏的。嫂子愿意分开，省的谁沾了谁？”银桂一听，敢情她们当真的分开了，便说：“以后你们生产挣的钱怎么办？”“各人干，各人挣，各人吃呗！”银桂媳妇干脆的说：“早早晚晚也得走这条道儿。”银桂听着，知道她们是闹上了蹩扭，又问：“究竟为啥？”“为啥！”银桂媳妇鼓着小嘴气囔囔地说，“婆婆不管了，倒出来了个嫂子。哼！”银桂见媳妇又提那天那桩子事，就向她解释着：“我不是给你说过，那天那事谁也不怨，就怨我扯了几句淡话。”
    前些日子，银桂从校里回来。金桂媳妇正在院里堵墙头，一个人累了满头大汗，衣服上溅了很多的泥点。银桂问：“墙塌了？”“塌了这么一点，补上就好啦！”金桂媳妇一边用袖子擦汗，一边喘着气说。银桂又问：“怎么就你一个人＠呢？”说着便挽起袖子，帮着又是打水，又是和泥，又是＠。金桂媳妇看着银桂那么起劲的干着，心里很喜欢。这一喜欢话可也就跟着多了，“下场雨，墙头塌了，我跟着孩子顾不过来，一直拖延到今天，小臭婶婶在娘家住了这些天，还没回来，咱家里这几天也挺忙，事都堆到一堆了。”金桂媳妇看了看银桂，接着无意地说：“小臭婶婶那样都好，就是好住……。”她的话说了半截，便听见：“嫂子你忙哩！”原来是银桂媳妇拿着小包袱回来，见自己丈夫和嫂子在＠墙，便招呼了一下子，也没有听见她们说什么。银桂帮着嫂子七手八脚的把墙＠起，就歇下了。
    银桂回到自己屋里，问他媳妇说：“以后没有事，多在家里住。”银桂媳妇就向丈夫解释说：“俺娘病了，在那里多住了几天。”其实说到这里不说，也就好了。银桂是个直性子人，向来舌头底下就压不住一粒米，他把方才金桂媳妇说的话全盘说了出来。这一下银桂媳妇可有点儿火：“有啥话，当面鼓，对面锣的说出来。哼！我就讨厌鬼鬼崇崇的背地里说长道短。”银桂媳妇把脸一扭，背着丈夫，象受了多大委屈，气的呼吃呼吃的直想哭。银桂一看不对头，准知道媳妇又多了心，走过去，拍着她的肩膀说：“你别犯疑心病，嫂嫂也没有说啥。”银桂媳妇是个好强的人，平常妯娌间的事抢着干，不愿落别人的话柄儿——妯娌们在一块没有几个好的。为了争这口气，银桂媳妇总是干到前头，吃到后头；生产挣的钱也交嫂嫂。今天经丈夫这么一说，她心眼里好几股岔儿，老觉着嫂嫂背地里不定向丈夫都说了些啥，心里委实不好受，对着墙壁，一时难过的哭起来，肩膀微微的抽搐着，眼窝里噙着泪水。银桂赶忙递给她手巾，让她擦泪，她不理。银桂便亲自替她擦着，一面笑着说：“你真是小孩脾气，说哭就哭。”“饭可吃，气可不能受啊！”银桂媳妇抽搐着说。
    银桂说：“常在一块，净挑眼还行。”“不行，就弄开。”银桂媳妇平常从来没有说过这样的话；这时，她象疯了似的，左一个分开，右一个分开，银桂一直是说着好话。
    夜里挺静的，金桂媳妇在自己屋里把小臭哄睡，一个人坐在灯下纳底子，心里想着：小组长说，以后做袜子的工钱给的小米又多了，小臭婶子也回来了，可要好好的干一阵，多做几双袜子，多挣几个钱。等过八月十五，痛痛快快吃一天。正想着，她被银桂媳妇和银桂说话的声音打乱，她开始以为是俩口子在抬扛；后来又听见银桂媳妇杀气腾腾说：“分开！……”她忽的就有了一股气，把刚才那番生产计划也打消了。她想：平常我待她不错啊！人心真是看不透，想不到她存心要分开。哼！分开就分开！
    这天夜里，银桂和他媳妇谈了半宵。金桂媳妇马马虎虎听了个“分”字，也打划着自己的事。
    银桂这次回来，万也想不到真的就分开了。银桂倒不是说：分开就绝对不好，这里面有个原因，街里号召妇女们生产互助，家里就她们妯娌俩，两个人分开，生两炉火，做两炉子饭，又费煤又不经济时间；再说，分开以后，各人生各人的产，没有两个人在一块方便，办法多，银桂左思右想，她们素常在一块也挺好，为这点小事闹意见太不值得。
    银桂媳妇刷洗了锅碗后，拿了双底子，向丈夫说：“我上前院金枝那里做去，那里有电灯。你要困就先睡吧！”
    银桂拦住媳妇说：“不能走，你到底打算怎样？好好的分开，不蹩扭吗？”银桂媳妇索性坐下来，看着丈夫不声不啃。“你一个人，一天又是生火，又是做饭，又得干活，多麻烦，”银桂大声的说。这些话正说在银桂媳妇的心里，本来一分开，银桂媳妇就有些后悔。比如从前，有些啥事商量，商量，计算着搞什么生产合适啦！两个人在一块谈谈笑笑那种高兴……，她想起好多事，再想分开后的蹩扭劲儿。可是既然分开了，又不好意思向丈夫说什么。银桂媳妇两手玩弄着衣角，两只眼睛瞅着在地上移动着的脚尖，看了看丈夫，又想说话，可又吞吞吐吐的不说，抿着嘴笑着。银桂象看出她的心事似的，站起来说：“我去找嫂嫂谈谈。”银桂媳妇也站起来，还想说什么，可是银桂早迈着大步出去了。
    金桂媳妇正在坑上给小臭做夹袄，今天他没有别的活可干了，弄了个孩子，一天也没有腾出空来，去工厂里拿活去。不由的她想起银桂媳妇的好处，若是往常，银桂媳妇早跑着把活给送来，这时她反倒埋怨开自己，那天夜里，银桂媳妇说了个分，自己就不是味了。可是，平常她不是那路尖薄的女人啊！金桂媳妇愈想愈是不得劲儿，心里乱遭遭的象塞了一把柴火。“嫂子，你们怎么分开吃饭了，在一块多方便。”银桂一进屋便这样说。金桂媳妇抬起头来，看着银桂，裂着嘴，很不自然的笑着，眼睛直＠＠的，显着怪难为情的样儿。银桂坐在炕边，看看小臭睡得呼呼地，便放低了声音说：“嫂子，还是合在一块儿吧，就你们两个人，在家里分开多不好。你们生产都挺积极，在一块商商量量的多方便，再说，你们若是一闹不团结，影响也不好啊！”银桂一个劲说着，金媳妇一个劲听着。
    在金桂媳妇的屋里，坐着金桂媳妇、银桂和银桂的媳妇，她们三人在召开家庭会议。金桂媳妇首先说：“街里动员妇女要咱们互助生产，连咱妯娌两都不能互助，真可笑，这都怨我的脾气不好。”银桂的媳妇也承认着错：“不怨你，怨我的小性多。”说着看了她丈夫一眼，那意思象责备丈夫在那天晚上谈那没味的话。银桂看着她妯娌俩又重归和好了，心里很是喜欢。
    第二天清早，金桂媳妇和银桂媳妇又象往常似的坐在院里做活，金桂媳妇说：“把火还挪到院里吧，在屋里热的受不了。”银桂媳妇说：“一炉火在棚下正合适。”她们妯娌俩个说说笑笑，谈着生活，谈着生产又好象一对亲姐妹一样。
