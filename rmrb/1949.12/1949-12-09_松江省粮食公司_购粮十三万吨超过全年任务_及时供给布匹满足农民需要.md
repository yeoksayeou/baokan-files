  　Purchases 130,000 Tons of Grain, Exceeding Annual Target
    Promptly Supplies Cloth to Meet Farmers' Needs
    [Our Newspaper] The Songjiang Province Grain Company has achieved remarkable results in purchasing surplus grain from rural areas. From October 1st to November 27th, in just over fifty days, it purchased over 130,000 tons, exceeding the annual grain purchase target by 64 percent. Among these, 58,872 tons were purchased through cooperatives, accounting for 45 percent of the total purchases; 71,997 tons were purchased directly from farmers, accounting for 55 percent of the total purchases. Soybeans accounted for the largest proportion of the grain purchased, at 62 percent of all types of grain.
    The main reasons for being able to complete and exceed the annual grain purchase target in such a short period are: 1. The correct price policy was implemented, appropriately narrowing the price difference between industrial and agricultural products, which won the support of the broad masses of farmers and dispelled farmers' speculative ideas of waiting for prices to rise. According to statistics, total purchases accounted for more than 80 percent of the grain on the market, leaving no opportunity for unscrupulous merchants attempting to speculate by purchasing grain at low prices. 2. The difficulties in obtaining materials were appropriately resolved, and farmers were supplied with cloth and daily necessities in a timely manner, meeting their seasonal needs. The company transferred 35,000 bolts of various types of cloth from Shenyang and supplied them to farmers at low prices. For example, fine blue cloth was sold by private merchants for 26,000 yuan per foot (Northeast currency, same below), while the company sold it for only 22,500 yuan. 3. The grain purchase time was timely, one month earlier than in previous years, giving farmers time to sell grain before delivering public grain. The company also set up grain purchase stations in various counties, simplifying payment procedures and achieving immediate sales upon arrival. 4. Under the leadership of the local Party and government, the business capabilities of the grain purchasing cadres improved, and they worked tirelessly day and night, providing great convenience to the farmers.

  　购粮十三万吨超过全年任务
    及时供给布匹满足农民需要
    【本报讯】松江省粮食公司收购农村余粮获得显著成绩。从十月一日至十一月二十七日五十余天内，计收购十三万余吨，超过全年购粮任务百分之六十四。其中通过合作社购入者五万八千八百七十二吨，占总购入数百分之四十五；直接向农民购买的有七万一千九百九十七吨，占总购入数的百分之五十五。收购粮食中以大豆为最多，占各种粮食的百分之六十二。
    在短期内能完成并超过全年购粮任务的主要原因是：一、执行了正确的价格政策，使工农业品的比价差额适当缩小，获得广大农民的拥护；同时打消了农民观望等待涨价的思想。据统计总购入数约占上市粮食的百分之八十以上，使欲低价收购粮食企图投机的奸商无机可乘。二、适当解决了物资的困难，及时供应农民布匹日用品，满足了农民的换季需要。该公司曾由沈阳拨回各种布三万五千匹、低价供给农民，如青细布私商每尺二万六千元（东北币下同），公司仅售二万二千五百元。三、购粮时间及时，比往年提早一月，使农民在未送公粮前有工夫卖粮。该公司并在各县普设购粮栈，简化了付货手续，达到随来随卖。四、在当地党、政领导下，购粮干部业务能力提高，不辞辛苦澈夜工作，给予农民极大便利。
