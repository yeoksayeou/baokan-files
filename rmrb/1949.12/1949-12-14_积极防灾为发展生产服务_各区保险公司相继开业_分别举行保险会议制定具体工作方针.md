　　Actively Preventing Disasters to Serve Production Development
  　Insurance Companies in Various Regions Open One After Another
    Holding Insurance Meetings to Formulate Specific Work Guidelines
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Since the conclusion of the National Insurance Conference at the end of September (as noted in the second page of this newspaper on October 21st), the head office of the People's Insurance Company of China, the East China District Company, and the directly subordinate Tianjin Branch, opened for business on October 20th in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin respectively. The Northeast District Company was reorganized and established in Shenyang on November 1st, the Central China District Company opened in Hankou on November 11th, and the Northwest District Company opened in Xi'an on December 12th. The insurance work in the Southwest and former South China regions is currently being planned. In order to promote the construction of the New Democratic economy and implement the resolutions of the National Insurance Conference, various regions have successively convened insurance conferences for each region. Based on the head office's work guidelines and in connection with the actual conditions of each region, they discussed various specific issues.

    The Central China District Insurance Conference was held in Hankou from October 25th to 29th. It was determined that the main business targets of the Central China District's insurance business at present are: various public-owned enterprises, large private factories and warehouses, goods transported by various public and private transportation organizations, and collateral for People's Bank pledged loans. It is forbidden for non-brokers to engage in broker duties. The insurance rates in the district were revised and lowered, and brokers' commissions were unified (fire insurance is uniformly 20 percent, transportation insurance is 10 percent, and war insurance does not pay commissions). After the establishment of the Central China District Company, its Changsha Branch was established on November 11th, and the Nanchang Branch was established on December 1st. In other major locations within the district, offices or agencies will be established within the year as needed.

    The East China District Insurance Conference was held in Shanghai from November 7th, lasting six days. The conference discussed the decisions of the National Insurance Conference and the issue of establishing a foreign exchange insurance professional company based on the China Property Insurance Company and combined with import and export trade. The East China District Company also plans to strive to open five branch companies in Sunan (in Wuxi), Zhejiang (in Hangzhou), Shandong (in Jinan), Nanjing, and Qingdao, and three directly subordinate offices in Southern Anhui (in Wuhu), Northern Anhui (in Hefei), and Northern Jiangsu (in Taixian) before December 1st. Branch offices will be established in Bengbu in Northern Anhui and Nantong in Northern Jiangsu.

    The Northeast District Insurance Conference was held in Shenyang from November 8th to 10th. In addition to exchanging the insurance work experience of the Northeast in the past five months and reviewing the insurance business performance of the Shenyang and Harbin branch companies and the 44 agencies in various cities and counties, the conference also passed a business competition to mobilize various branches during the winter to meet the needs of the masses in winter.

    The insurance conferences in various regions, according to the decisions of the National Insurance Conference, clarified that the future New Democratic insurance undertaking is a policy of serving the development of production, emphasized the establishment of a new work style, that is, changing from passively engaging in ex-post compensation to actively strengthening ex-ante disaster prevention, in order to fundamentally protect the lives and property of the people. In terms of business, in addition to fire insurance, transportation insurance, and war insurance (such as airplane bombing), which have already been opened first, personal insurance, which is particularly related to improving the welfare of the working people and accumulating production funds, will also strive to be promoted around the New Year.

    华中区保险会议于十月二十五日至廿九日在汉口举行。确定了华中区保险业务当前主要业务对象为：各公营企业单位，各大私营工厂、仓库，各公私运输机构承运物资及人民银行质押贷款之质押品。禁止非经纪人从事经纪人职务。修改并减低了区内保险费率，划一经纪人佣金（火险一律百分之二十，运输险百分之十，兵险不支佣金）。华中区公司成立后，其长沙分公司于十一月十一日，南昌分公司于十二月一日分别成立，区内其他主要地点，视需要将于年内设立办事处或代理处。

    各地区保险会议根据全国保险会议的决定，明确了今后新民主主义保险事业是为发展生产服务的方针，强调树立新的作风，即从消极的从事事后赔偿，改变为积极的加强事前防灾，以期从根本上保护人民的生命财产。业务方面，除火险、运输险、兵险（如飞机轰炸）等业经首先开办外，与提高劳动人民福利及积累生产资金特别有关的人身保险，也将争取在新年前后推行。（中国人民保险公司通讯小组）
