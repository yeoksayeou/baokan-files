　　China Geological Society Capital Area Annual Meeting Concludes
　　Discussions and Summaries of Geological Education and Work
　　[This newspaper reported] The 25th Annual Meeting of the Capital Area of the China Geological Society successfully concluded yesterday (the 26th). Starting at 9:00 a.m., the conference divided into two groups, the Northeast Mineral Products Group and the Datong Geology Group, for discussions.

　　Professor Ma Xingyuan chaired the Mineral Products Group. Professor Wang Zhuquan from Peking University first gave a general and specific introduction to the distribution and geological overview of non-ferrous metals in the Northeast. Subsequently, various units that went to the Northeast for mineral exploration during the summer presented detailed reports on various mining areas.

　　Regarding gold and copper mines, there were reports on: Wang Zhuquan, Huatonggou in Fuxian County; Meng Xianmin, Furong in Zhuanghe County, Ma Xingheng; Biezegou in Qingyuan, Xiadabao; Wang Jiayin, Juzi in Panshi, and other mining area reports.

　　Regarding silver, lead, and zinc mines, there were reports from: the first work group of Tsinghua summer program, Tianbaoshan in Jilin; the third work group, Xiuyan, etc.

　　After the Mineral Products Group finished discussing the reports from various regions, Mr. Gu Gongxu from the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted an experiment using a "Geiger-Muller counter" to identify minerals containing radioactive elements.

　　The Datong Geology Group discussion was chaired by Mr. Yue Xixin from the Beijing Geological Survey. They held detailed discussions on the history of surveys in the area, the Cambrian-Ordovician stratigraphic layering, the economic value of loess and coalfields, and future prospecting guidelines. Professors Zhang Xi＠, Wang Hongzhen, Yang Zunyi, and Mr. Yue Xixin spoke the most in the meeting, and their opinions were highly valued.

　　The plenary session was held at 2:00 p.m., chaired by Professor Meng Xianmin. First, Zhang Xi＠ presented a preliminary summary of the discussion on geological education: (1) Standards: In politics, it is necessary to grasp the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoints, and methods; in professional skills, it is necessary to ensure independent work and the ability to create geological maps. (2) Training cadres: In terms of curriculum content, it is necessary to streamline and focus on basic (core) training; in terms of methodology, it is necessary to suit the national conditions, strengthen visual education, and find ways to compile Chinese textbooks; in terms of the system, there is a suggestion for a work-study program (referring to universities)—that is, after completing three years of courses, students can go to enterprise departments for a one-year internship and then return to school for one year; in terms of quantity, in order to meet the current urgent needs, it is recommended to add specialized courses or training classes. In addition, he also proposed the need for better cooperation between enterprise departments and academic departments, especially paying attention to publishing popular geological publications, compiling specialized terminology, and unifying geological teaching materials. Next, Gao Ping presented a preliminary summary of the discussion on geological work: (1) The current problems in the work are: the results are not sufficiently applied to industrial and mining construction; the estimation of reserves is not accurate enough; the prospecting tools are insufficient. (2) The task of geological workers is to clearly recognize that they are the vanguard of production and construction. (3) Future work guidelines: (1) Correct individualism and closely connect with the masses. (2) Unify leadership and strengthen organization. (3) Basic work: Complete the 1:1,000,000 national geological map and the 1:200,000 provincial maps. (4) Key work: Focus on petroleum, iron, and other national defense metals; the Northeast is the first key area, and North China is the second key area; and identify the key areas for each region, such as petroleum in the Northwest and tungsten, antimony, and tin in Hunan and Jiangxi. (5) Research work: must be combined with practical problems. (6) Learn from foreign countries, especially from the advanced Soviet Union.

　　The conference then listened to reports from the accountant Yue Xixin and the secretary Wang Hongzhen on administrative matters, and proceeded to discuss issues such as the general association's charter and the provisional working regulations of the branch associations. Later, chaired by Professor Sun Yunzhu, the papers "Ancient Geography of China After the Luliang Movement and Before the Caledonian Movement," "Preliminary Study of the Tungsten Mine in Miyun County, Hebei," and other valuable papers related to geology, mineral resources, and paleontology in various regions, a total of fourteen articles, were read.

　　Finally, the conference unanimously passed a tribute to Chairman Mao. At 5:30 p.m., amidst applause, the chairman of the conference, Sun Yunzhu, announced the closing of the conference.

　　中国地质学会首都区年会闭幕
　  讨论总结地质教育及工作
    【本报讯】中国地质学会第二十五届首都区年会已于昨（二十六）日胜利闭幕。大会上午九时起分东北矿产、大同地质两小组进行讨论。
    矿产小组由马杏垣教授主持。首由北大王竹泉教授就东北有色金属分布，地质概况做一般具体的介绍。继由本年暑期赴东北勘察矿产的各单位提出各矿区详细报告。
    关于金铜矿方面有：王竹泉，复县化铜沟；孟宪民，庄河县芙蓉，马杏恒；清原稗子沟，下大堡；王嘉荫，磐石咀子等等矿区报告。
    关于银铅锌矿方面有：清华暑期第一工作组，吉林天宝山；等第三工作组，岫岩等报告。
    当矿产小组讨论各区报告终了以后，科学院顾功叙先生做了一个用“盖格—米勒计数器”鉴定含放射性元素矿物的实验。
    大同地质的小组讨论是由北京地质调查民岳希新先生主持的。针对该区域调查历史，寒武奥陶纪地层分层，关于黄土，煤田的经济价值及今后探矿方针等方面详细商讨；会场中的发言以张席＠、王鸿祯、杨遵议等教授和岳希新先生最多，所提的意见亦甚受人重视。
    下午二时举行全体会，由孟宪民教授主持。首由张席＠提出关于地质教育讨论的初步总结：（一）水准方面：在政治上要把握马列主义的立场，观点方法；在业务上要保证独立工作，能测制地质图。（二）培养干部方面；在课程内容上要确实精简，注重基本（重心）训练；大方法上，要适合国情，加强形象教育，并设法编著中文课本；在制度上，有工读制（指大学）的建议——即读完三年课程可到企业部门实习一年，然后再返校读一年；在数量上，为配合目前急需，建议增设专修科或训练班。另外并提出要求企业部门与学术部门更好地配合，特别要注意发行通俗的地质刊物，编译专门名词，统一地质学教学资料等。次由高平提出初步地质工作讨论总结：（一）目前工作中存在的问题是：成果不够工矿建设应用；储量估计欠准确；探矿的工具不够。（二）地质工作者任务，要明确认识到自己是生产建设的先遣队。（三）今后工作方针：（１）纠正个人主义，密切联系群众。（２）统一领导，加强组织。（３）基础工作：完成百万分之一全国地质图，和二十万分之一分省图。（４）重点工作：以石油、铁和其他国防金属重点；东北为第一重点，华北为第二重点；并找出各区载的重点，如西北以石油、湘赣以钨锑锡为重点。（５）研究工作：要结合实际问题。（６）向国外学习，特别是向先进的苏联学习。
    大会继听取会计岳希新、书记王鸿桢关于事务的报告，并转入讨论总会会章、分会暂行工作条例等问题。后由孙云铸教授主持宣读“吕梁运动后加里东运动前之中国古地理”、“河北密云县境钨矿初步研究”，及其他有价值的关乎各地地质、矿产资源、古生物等的论文，共十四篇。
    最后大会一致通过向毛主席致敬。于午后五时半在一片掌声中由大会孙云铸主席宣布闭幕。
