　　The Root of Impatience
    Du Lijun
    "You are good in all other aspects, but you have a slight problem—impatience..."
    In group criticism meetings, one often hears this kind of comment. The person being criticized feels it is a "small problem," so they don't pay much attention and let it slide, thinking, "I just won't be impatient in the future!"
    Like this, simply correcting the mistake without any ideological analysis is wrong; it won't be of great help in correcting the error.
    In fact, is impatience a "small problem"? Are the impatience issues you, he, and I commit all the same? Where is the root of impatience?
    Impatience is by no means simply a hasty temperament. All forms of impatience are governed by specific ideological activities. After careful examination, there are roughly three types of ideological roots of impatience:
    First, concern for face: There is a young comrade in our class. She applied to join the Youth League and wrote her autobiography, tearing it up and rewriting it repeatedly. She was so anxious that she was about to cry. I asked her why she was like this. She said, "Those who entered school with me have all joined the Youth League. When we graduate in the future, people will definitely say, 'You studied at Huada for five or six months, and you didn't even strive to become a League member!'—Wouldn't that be too embarrassing! At the same time, I also think, if my application to join the League is not approved this time, people will definitely laugh at me. This is really too embarrassing! Therefore, as soon as I write my autobiography, I get so anxious and flustered that I can't write anything!" From her words, apart from the impure motive for joining the League, her impatience is basically governed by concern for face. Why is she impatient? She is afraid of being "laughed at," "too embarrassed," and "too ashamed!" Later, comrades in the group solemnly analyzed this root for her at the criticism meeting and gave other examples. She said excitedly, "Before, everyone criticized me for being impatient, and I didn't know how to start correcting it. Now, I understand that my impatience is not simple; it is built on the foundation of concern for face! To defeat my impatience, I must first defeat my self-centered concern for face..."—This is the first type.
    Second, individual heroism: There is a comrade in our class who studies theoretical books quite a bit. When holding discussions, he never respects other people's speeches, doesn't listen to other people's opinions, but only manipulates dogmas and makes lengthy arguments. The group criticized him for being impatient. He said, "I am upholding my opinion and obeying the truth—my temperament is naturally impatient!" Later, the comrades criticized him, saying, "Your impatience cannot be explained by 'naturally impatient.' From the ideological root, your impatience is a manifestation of individual heroism! You are not starting from learning, not starting from solving problems, but wanting to overwhelm others and show off yourself!"
    This comrade also shows impatience in other aspects: for example, in order to show off himself, he often proposes overly high tasks to comrades when implementing organizational decisions. He doesn't accept other people's opinions, so that his "methods" don't work and he becomes detached from the masses. This kind of impatience governed by individual heroism is very dangerous if it continues to develop, and he will make big mistakes when implementing policies at his work post after graduation. Now, he has accepted the comrades' criticism and is doing a deep self-criticism.
    Third, purely task-oriented view: In one class, during the disaster relief campaign, a group leader did not publicize, mobilize, or study the situation within the group, but subjectively launched a "mutual challenge based on individuals." As a result, those who had things or money to donate, of course, had no problem, but those who really had nothing to donate faced great difficulty and were very dissatisfied with the group leader, saying that he was "a distorted form of coercion," which created a gap in the comrades' feelings and affected the group's learning mood.
    From this example, the impatience of this group leader is governed by a purely task-oriented view. He didn't mobilize the masses in the group, didn't enlighten the masses ideologically about the disaster relief campaign, and didn't study the actual situation of each person in the group, but simply completed the task for the sake of completing the task, as a result, he became detached from the masses.
    There are many more roots of impatience. The three mentioned above are just what I have discovered from my study life at school. If these impatience issues continue to develop, when we work and grasp policies after graduation, we will make big mistakes.
    Impatience is not a "small problem." The mistakes made by each person are not necessarily exactly the same. To fight against impatience, we must start by digging into the ideological roots!

### 急性病的根源

　　急性病的根源
    杜黎均
    “你别的什么都好，只是有点小毛勃—急性箔…。”
    在小组检讨会上，常听到有这样的批评。被批评的人觉得这是“小毛病”，便不太注意，也就滑过去了，心里想着：“以后不急就是啦！”
    象这样单就错误而改错误，毫不作思想分析，是不对的；这对于错误的改正，不会有什么大的帮助。
    其实，急性病是“小毛病”吗？你所犯的、他所犯的、我所犯的急性病都相同吗？急性病的根源在那里？
    急性病决不是单纯的性情急躁，凡是急性病都被一定的思想活动所支配着，仔细挖掘一下，急性病大约有三种类型的思想根源：
    第一、爱面子：我们班有一位小同志，她申请入团写自传，撕了又写，写了又撕；写不好，急得要哭。我问她，为什么这样呢？她说：“和我一起入学的，都入团了，将来毕业后，人家一定说：“你在华大学习五六个月，怎么连一个团员都没有争取上！”——这样，显着多不好意思！同时，我又想，这次申请入团、如果批不准、人家一定笑话我、这真太难为情啦！所以，我一写自传，就急得一头火，越急越写不出来！”从她这段话来看，除了入团动机不够纯正外，她的急性病基本上是被面子观念所支配着的，为什么急呢？怕的是人家“笑话”，“多不好意思”，“太难为情”！后来，小组同志在检讨会上郑重地给她分析了这个根源，并举出别的例子。她兴奋地说：“从前，大家批评我急性病，我也不知道怎样下手改。现在，我才明白，我这个急性病并不简单，原来是建筑在爱面子的基础上！打垮我的急性病，必须先打垮我的从个人出发的爱面子才行……。”——这是第一种类型。
    第二、个人英雄主义：我们班有一位啃理论书比较多的同志，开讨论会时，他说话向来是不尊重别人发言，不倾听别人意见，只搬弄教条，大发议论。小组批评他急性病，他说：“我这是坚持意见，服从真理呀——我的性情，生来好急！”后来，同志们检讨了他，说：“你这个急性病不是用‘生来好急’就可以解释得了的，从思想根源上来看，你这急性病是个人英雄主义的表现！你不是从学习出发，不是从解决问题出发，而是想压倒别人，表现自己！”
    这位同志在其他方面也表现着急性病：例如他为了表现自己，在执行组织决定时，往往向同志们提出过高的任务。别人提意见他也不接受，以致他的“办法”行不通，脱离了群众。这样受个人英雄主义所支配着的急性病，如果发展下去是非常危险的，将来毕业后到工作岗位上执行政策时，要犯大错误。现在，他已接受同志们的批评，在深深地作自我检讨。
    第三、单纯任务观点：有一班，在救灾运动中，有一位小组长在组内不宣传，不动员，不研究组内情况，主观在发动了以人为单位的互相挑战”。这样一来，有东西或有钱可捐的，当然不成问题，但确实无东西无钱可捐的，却作了大难，对小组长非常不满，说他是“变形的强制”，以致在同志感情间有了隔阂，影响了组内的学习情绪。
    从这个例子来看，这位小组长的急性病，是被单纯任务观点所支配着的，他在组内不去动员群众，不去从思想上启发群众对救灾运动的认识，不去研究组内每一个人的实际情况，只是单纯的为完成任务而完成任务，结果，他脱离了群众。
    急性病的根源还很多，以上所说的三种，只是我从校内的学习生活中所发现到的。这些急性病如果再继续发展下去，等毕业后搞工作掌握政策的时候，我们将会犯大错误。
    急性病，不是“小毛病”，每一个人所犯的，也不一定都完全相同。跟急性病作斗争，必须从挖掘思想根源着手！
