　　"Advocate Learning Art to Serve the People"
　  (Reading Article 45 of Chapter 5 of the Common Program)
　　Er Zhong
　　The position of new literature and art in the new culture is very important. Because through it, the new generation of masters is expressed in various literary and artistic forms, and the new generation of masters also obtains a new way of life suitable for being masters—joyful, healthy, scientific, free,… In short, it reverses the past humiliating, sad, sorrowful, and resentful life forms of being oppressed. …
　　Today's era: First, in the arduous struggle of the past century, the people of the whole country have explored a major experience, that is, only under the leadership of the proletariat can the thorough liberation of the Chinese nation be achieved; second, the people are no longer in the initial stage of naive resistance, but in the struggle of class self-awareness; third, in the long-term struggle, the people have cultivated a large number of people full of new ideological consciousness. In short, now that the People's Government has been established by overthrowing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the whole country has entered a new era of construction.
　　Therefore, the content of this generation's literature and art serving the people should focus on portraying the people's heroes led by the proletariat, tempered in long-term struggles, and carrying relatively systematized ideological consciousness, as well as the heroic achievements of these heroes in armed struggle, economic construction, or production processes, attracting everyone to learn from them and cultivating more such people for the new society to meet the needs of construction. This is the very important task given to literature and art by the real environment.
　　However, our literary and art workers still do not have a sufficient understanding of new types of people. This is where the weaknesses frequently exposed in current literary and art work lie. Reflected in literary and artistic works, there are several unhealthy manifestations:
　　First, they are good at writing about villains but not good at writing about positive figures. When writing about the backward side of reality, they are eloquent, but when it comes to the progressive side of the masses, they often dodge, gloss over, and dare not let the protagonist speak out.
　　Second, they are not good at writing about the ideological development process of a people's hero and the actual actions guided by this ideology. For example, when writing about heroes in the army, it is just about charging and not being afraid of death. As for the revolutionary heroism of heroes in the ideological battlefront in the army, apart from "Yang Yong's Meritorious Service," which is a relatively successful drama, it is often expressed weakly. Often, negative things are written very richly, and the transformation is written as "sudden enlightenment and instant Buddhahood." Raising ideological awareness is regarded as something that can be obtained overnight, and after one obtains it, it is perfect. What is most noteworthy is that the leading role of the Communist Party is often ignored. In fact, without the leadership of the Communist Party, how can Zhao Zhankui become today's hero? How can there be so many people's heroes appearing? Literature and art, in form and content, are far behind the rich and vivid real life.
　　Third, they regard the fanaticism of the petty bourgeoisie as the joy of the working people. Some people criticize the poetry of the liberated areas as being of the "sun" school and the "hey-ho-hey" school. This criticism has a certain degree of truth. Open our poetry—especially songs—and if we remove words like "sun," "red," "radiance," "hey-ho-hey," etc., the content will appear poor. It's not that there is no new content, but that literary and art workers have not understood it. Chairman Mao, in his opening speech at the CPPCC, clearly explained the various forms of struggle of the Chinese people in the past, present, and future, thereby unfolding a bright vista. Among all the poems praising the New China CPPCC during this period, this spirit was not well reflected—in fact, this spirit is precisely the spirit of the people. As long as we go to the working people, we will see that they are joyful and express it in various ways. Why don't we express this joy of the working people? Subjectively speaking from the author's point of view, the main reason is that literary and art workers are not familiar with the people, do not conduct thorough investigation and research, and do not experience life. They just write casually for convenience, and the result is only obliterating the people's nature of literature and art and reducing the role and value of the works.
　　Fourth, they use slogans to replace the realistic postures of the masses. Correct political slogans represent the demands of the people, which is true, but political slogans must never become the artistic form of expressing the masses. Mr. Lu Xun had already criticized this. To this day, we have not been able to eradicate it. Why? In a word, it is because we do not know what language and posture the masses use to deal with these political slogans. For example, some poor peasants who have turned themselves around and have a secure life use smiles, or no smiles, verbal or silent actions, and various postures to express their love for Chairman Mao because they often see the livestock in their troughs, the pumpkins on their racks, the sorghum and soybeans in the fields, and men, women, old, and young wearing new clothes… From these, they embody the joy of their happy life after turning themselves around and their deep support and love for Chairman Mao. However, our authors often superficially handle these vivid and real contents, and even political slogans replace artistic forms.
　　Because our understanding of the actual life of the masses is insufficient, we often use slogans to replace the various real lives of the masses, use negative descriptions to overwhelm positive ones, omit the process of ideological development, and set aside the leadership of the Communist Party, etc., which invisibly makes many parts of our literary and artistic works form idealism, which is essentially anti-scientific and not of the people. Therefore, it also loses the significance of "enlightening the people's political consciousness." I think this is something that literary and art workers should pay attention to and study.

　　“提倡学艺术为人民服务”
　  （读共同纲领第五章第四十五条）
    尔重
    新的文学艺术在新文化中所占的地位是很重要的。因为通过它把新一代的主人用各种文学艺术形式表现出来，而新一代的主人也从而得到一个新的适合于做主人的生活形式——愉快的，健壮的，科学的，自由的，……总之，一反过去的屈辱、悲伤、愁苦、怨愤的被压迫的生活形式。……
    今天的时代：第一，全国人民在百年来的艰苦斗争中已经摸索了一条主要经验，即只有在无产阶级领导下才能求得中华民族彻底解放；第二，人民已经不是初期的幼稚的反抗，而是阶级自我认识的斗争；第三，人民在长期斗争中，已经锻炼出一大批充满着新的思想意识的人物。总之，现在是已由打倒了帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义建立了人民政府，全国走入了新的建设时代。
    因此，这一代的文学艺术为人民服务的内容，就要着重地表现无产阶级所领导的，在长期斗争中洗炼了的，带着比较系统化的思想意识的人民英雄，以及这些英雄在武装斗争经济建设或生产过程中的英勇业绩，吸引大家向着他们学习，为新社会培养出更多的这类人物，以满足建设的需要，这便是现实环境所赋予文学艺术的十分重大的任务。
    但，我们的文艺工作者对新型人物的体会还很不足。这就是目前文艺工作上所经常暴露弱点的地方。反映在文学艺术作品上便有下列几种不健康的表现：
    第一是善于写反派不善于写正面。写实际中落后一面则振振有词，至于群众进步的一面，往往是躲躲闪闪，轻描淡写，不敢让主角张口说话。
    第二是不善于写一个人民英雄的思想发展过程及其由这种思想指导下的实际行动。例如写部队的英雄就是冲锋不怕死，对于部队中英雄在思想战线上的革命英雄主义气派，除“杨勇立功”是部比较成功的戏剧外，往往表现得软弱无力。往往是把反面东西写得很丰富，把转变写成“一朝澈悟，立地成佛”。把思想的提高，当为一夜即得的事，而且一得之后，就尽善尽美。最值得注意的是把共产党的领导作用，经常地忽略过去。其实，没有共产党的领导，怎能说赵占奎会成为今天的英雄呢？怎能说会有许许多多人民英雄的出现呢？文学艺术在形式上，在内容上，远远落后于丰富的生动的现实生活后面。
    第三是把小资产阶级的狂热，当为劳动人民的喜悦：有人批评解放区的诗歌，就是“太阳”派，“嘿嗬嘿”派，这个批评是有一定限度道理的。打开我们的诗歌看——特别是歌，如果把“太阳”“红”“光芒”“嘿嗬嘿”……一类的词去掉，内容就显得贫乏了。新的内容不是没有，而是文艺工作者未曾体会到，毛主席在政协开幕词中，已经把中国人民的过去的现在的未来的各种斗争形式均有明确的说明，从而展开了一个光明的远景。这一期间所有歌颂新中国人民政协的诗歌里，没有很好把这种精神反映出来——事实上这种精神正是人民的精神。只要我们到劳动人民中去看，他们是在喜悦，而且用各种姿态表现着。我们为什么不把劳动人民这种喜悦表现出来呢？从作者主观上说，主要的还是文艺工作者不熟悉人民，不好好进行调查研究，不去体验生活，只是为了方便省事，信手写来，其结果只是抹煞了文学艺术的人民性，而降低了作品的作用与价值。
    第四是以口号代替群众的现实姿态。正确的政治口号代表着人民的要求，这是不错的，而政治口号绝不能成为表现群众的艺术形式，这一点鲁迅先生早已批评过了。迄今，我们还未能根除，原因何在？一言以蔽之，就是我们不知道群众在用什么语言姿态处理这些政治口号。例如一些翻了身，生活有了保障的贫苦农民，他们是用笑，或不笑，有声的或无声的各种行动，各种姿态表示着对毛主席的热爱，因为他们经常看到自己槽上的牲口，架上的倭瓜，地里的高粱大豆，男女老少穿上了新衣裳……从这些上面体现着他们翻身后美满生活的喜悦，对毛主席深沉的拥护与爱戴。而我们的作者却往往是浮而的处理了这些生动真实的内容，甚至政治口号代替了艺术形式。
    由于我们对群众的实际生活体会不够，时常用口号代替了群众各色各样的现实生活，用反派压倒正面的描写，略去了思想发展过程，撇开了共产党的领导等等，就无形中使我们文艺作品许多地方形成了唯心论，本质上是反科学精神的，非人民大众的。因此，也就失去了“启发人民政治觉悟”的意义。我觉得这是文艺工作者应该引起注意和研究的。
