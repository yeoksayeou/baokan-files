　　Noon, the youth, women, and children were putting on a play. Next to the stage at "Yellow River Ground," Lin Bao and Xi Lu led some people in hammering "Yellow River Stakes," preparing to light "Yellow River Lamps" and circle the "Yellow River" at night: this involved hammering three hundred and sixty-one two-or-three-foot-long wooden stakes into a square formation, nineteen stakes wide and nineteen stakes long, each stake a few feet apart, then using corn stalks to connect the stakes, forming a winding, twisting path from the outside in, either the "Five Horses Break Cao Formation" or the "Nine Curves Linked Ring Formation." Since ancient times, every year during the Lantern Festival, from the fourteenth to the sixteenth, the people of Black Stone Slope had to walk in and out of the formation for three nights, circling the "Yellow River." However, in the past eight or nine years, people had suffered great disasters and hardships, and had no mood to circle it. Now that they wanted to circle it, even the master of hammering the Yellow River Formation was hard to find. Only Lin Bao and Xi Lu were left, and Lin Bao didn't even fully know how. He asked Xi Lu to give specific instructions, but Xi Lu wasn't willing to just give instructions. He also wanted to personally hammer in the stakes and tie the corn stalks. After a whole afternoon of being old-fashioned and serious, he rushed to finish. Then he stood outside the entrance of the formation, looking at the couplet on both sides of the gate, which was different from previous years: "After crossing the Yellow River, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek; Attack Taiyuan, capture Yan Xishan alive." He recited it, touching his beard and smiling with squinted eyes.

　　It got dark, the moon came out, and the gongs and drums started playing. The whole village squeezed and bumped into each other, pouring into the Old Lord Temple. In the middle of the temple courtyard, pillars and colorful silks were used to build a square shed. In the front of the shed, a curtain was hung with portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, bought from Yangquan. Under the portraits, steamed buns, jujube flower cakes, and incense candles were offered on a horizontal table. Glass lanterns hung in front of the shed, with five large characters on a horizontal strip: "People's Savior Shed." The people of the whole village came to the shed, accompanied by musical instruments, shouting slogans in unison, and everyone took turns bowing three times to the people's savior. Qian Danao and some landlords who had been struggled against also squeezed into the crowd. They were a little flustered, as if afraid that people wouldn't let them participate in the ceremony. But seeing that nothing happened later, Qian Danao laughed and said to the crowd when he came out: "Look at that portrait, our Chairman Mao looks really blessed and prosperous!" But everyone didn't bother to listen to him, and frantically shouted slogans: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" Afterwards, they pushed and shoved, clamoring to go down and circle the Yellow River! Only one person was left in the back courtyard of the temple, and that was Tian Lu: he suddenly knelt down in front of the shed, kowtowed three times, stood up and walked into the shed again, silently looked at the portraits of the people's leaders for a long time, then slowly went down to the temple to the Yellow River Ground.

　　At this time, on every stake in the Yellow River Formation, a small oil lamp was lit, with colored paper covering the outside. The lamplight flickered with the beat of the gongs and drums, as if on the river. Inside the formation, musical instruments led the way, followed by men and women, old and young, and children riding on adults' necks, weaving back and forth, as if people were also on the river. After circling, the musical instruments and people returned to the temple. At the entrance of the temple, two furnaces of pestle-shaped fire were burning red, and the flames flickered out of the surrounding holes like tongues. The gongs and drums were played around the fire, and people sang and shouted around the gongs and drums. The young people also took out firecrackers from Ju Bao's house and set them off one after another.

　　The fifteenth day arrived, and the whole village "swished" with new clothes and new hats. Piles of women and children in red clothes, green pants, and floral shoes, silk, wool, and foreign cloth, were everywhere: these were all the clothes that the old rich men wore in previous years! Seeing Liu Goujia wearing a red satin jacket with团花, holding a floral towel, about to tie it on her head, she ran into Xiao Yanggui, and asked Xiao Yanggui to pull out some white hairs on her head, saying that it would make her look younger. Xiao Yanggui spat at her, and the two began to wrestle. Suddenly, the people around them surrounded them, pulled them together, and someone even tied them back to back with a rope. Everyone watched and laughed. Old Yin walked over, laughing so hard that he couldn't stand up. Liu Goujia said to Old Yin: "Look at our whole village, except for the old rich men, you are the only one who isn't wearing new clothes! Untie this rope for us, Old Yin, I'll take off this big jacket and give it to you!" Old Yin wouldn't untie it, but a few young people suddenly ran up and grabbed Old Yin, pulling him straight to his house, saying that they would also change Old Yin into new clothes...

　　These days, every family eats white flour dumplings. On the fifteenth and sixteenth days, the youth, women, and children put on new plays during the day, and circled the Yellow River as usual at night. Not a single person in the whole village wasn't playing and making noise, even Tian Lu was the same, and this was the first time in his life that he had rested for three days in a row! When he was watching the play, he ran into Shuan Cheng and suddenly said to Shuan Cheng: "This is really the first time in our history!" Shuan Cheng laughed: "It's nothing rare! Isn't next year the second time? Isn't the year after that the third time? From now on, this will be forever! Good days will only get better year by year." Tian Lu nodded his head, but then sighed deeply: "Alas..." But after a while, he squeezed to the front to watch the play again.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（５６）
    康濯
    响午，青年、妇女、儿童们排开了戏。戏楼底旁边的“黄河地”上，林宝和喜禄领了一些人在钉“黄河橛”，准备晚上点上“黄河灯”转“黄河”：这是在场上用三百六十一根二三尺长的木头橛，钉成横宽各十九根的四方阵，每根每根离开三几尺，再使玉茭秸连结橛子，梆一条从外到内又转出来的曲溜拐弯道路，或是“五马破曹阵”，或是“九曲连环阵”。亘古到今，黑石坡每年元宵，从十四到十六，人们都要在阵里转进转出转三夜“黄河”，只是这八九年人们大灾大难，没心思转了，闹得这会要转，连钉黄河阵的把式也难找，只有林宝和喜禄三两个，林宝还不全会，他就叫喜禄专门指点；但喜禄却不甘心指点，他还要亲自下手钉橛梆玉茭秸，古板正经地忙了一后响，赶忙完了，他又站到阵门外，看着门两边比往年都不同的对联：“过了黄河，消灭蒋介石；打到太原，活捉阎锡山。”一边念，一边摸着胡子，眯眯笑着。
    天黑了，月亮出来了，锣鼓细乐吹打起来，全村人挤着碰着，涌进了老君庙。庙院当中，使立柱和彩绸搭了个四方棚，棚里正面布上幔上挂着从阳泉买来的毛主席和朱总司令像，像下面横桌上供着馒头、枣花糕和香烛；棚前玻璃花灯吊着，横帔五个大字：“人民救星棚”。全村人们来到棚前，配着乐器，拴成喊着口令，大家轮班对人民救星三鞠躬，乾大脑和一些被斗过的地主也挤在人群中，他们却有些心慌意乱，象是怕人们不让他们参加行礼，但见后来没事，乾大脑就在出来的时候，嘻笑着对众人说：“看那像，咱毛主席长得真福泰！”不过众人没顾上听他的，都发疯一般地喊起了口号：“毛主席万岁！”“朱总司令万岁！”以后就推推撞撞嚷闹着下去转黄河去了！后边庙院里只丢下一个人，这是天禄：他忽然在棚前跪下，叩了三个头，站起来又走进棚里，在人民领袖像前不声不响地看了半天，才慢慢下庙到黄河地去。
    这时黄河阵里的每一根橛上，都点着一盏小油灯，灯外边套着色纸，灯光随着锣鼓点一闪一闪，像在河里一样；阵里边乐器领头，男女老少跟着，还有小孩孩骑在大人脖子上，穿过来扭过去，人也象在河里一般。转完了，乐器和人又回到庙上，庙门口两炉棒锤火正烧得通红，火苗从四周窟窿眼里象舌头一样忽闪忽闪吐出来，锣鼓也就围着火敲，人们再围着锣鼓唱着嚷着，青年们还拿着从聚宝家闹出来的鞭炮，放了一个又一个。
    十五到了，全村“刷”地一下都是新穿新戴，妇女儿童一堆堆的红衣绿裤花鞋，绸缎、呢绒、洋布，满处都是：这尽是往年正月老财们身上的衣裳哩！看柳沟家穿着团花红缎袄，拿了块花毛巾，正要往头上扎，却碰见小洋鬼，就叫小洋鬼给她头上拔掉些白头发，说是也让她年轻些；小洋鬼吐了她一口，二人便扭打起来。旁边人们忽然围上去，把他俩拉在一块，不知是谁还闹了根绳把他俩背对背梆住，大家在一边看着笑着，老尹走过来，也笑得立都立不住。柳沟家对老尹说：“你看咱一村除了老财们，可就是你没穿新衣裳！你给解了咱这绳吧，老尹，我把这大袄脱给你穿！”老尹不给解，几个青年却猛的跑上去拉住了老尹，并直往他们家拉，说是也要给老尹换新衣裳去……
    这几天家家吃白面煮饺，十五十六白天，青年、妇女、儿童们演新戏，黑夜照样转黄河；浑村没一个人不耍耍闹闹，就连天禄也一样，这并且是他一辈子头一回连着歇了三天！他看戏的时候碰见拴成，忽然对拴成说：“这真是咱们亘古以来头一回哩！”拴成笑道：“不稀罕！明年不就是第二回？后年不又是第三回？往后这就是长年永辈子的啦！好日月只会一年强比一年。”天禄点了点脑袋，却又长长地叹了口气：“唉……”但一会，他又挤到前边看戏去了。
