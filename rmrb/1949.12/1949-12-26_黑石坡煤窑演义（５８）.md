　　After a while, Lin Bao ran over to give Old Yin a letter. He casually asked, "Third Grand Uncle, when do you think this ventilation shaft will be open?" Third Grand Uncle didn't say a word. Little Foreign Devil said, "You might as well ask yourself when you're going to die!" People burst into laughter. Little Foreign Devil quickly added, "Don't laugh! In this water and fire business, who can say for sure with their eyes closed?" Third Grand Uncle turned his face away and said, "Anyway, it won't be more than a month. This is different from whether a person dies or not!" Jia Lu and Lin Bao couldn't help but shout at the same time, "Good heavens!" Lin Bao continued, "What will we spend in the meantime? The supplies in the storeroom are almost gone!" Everyone stared with wide eyes, speechless! Borrow grain? Just now, Old Yin received a letter from Old Bai, saying that the higher-ups were lending a batch of grain, but the notice said it was an agricultural loan to help poor farmers who had been allocated land to solve the problem of seeds and farm tools, and it wouldn't be lent to industry and mining for the time being. Old Bai also said in the letter that he disagreed with this one hundred percent, and he had gone to give his opinion. Old Yin looked at the letter, and then at the situation at the meeting, and couldn't help but crane his neck, flutter his eyelids, and get angry. He thought: The previous criticisms from above that the land reform here didn't pay attention to the characteristics of the industrial and mining areas were correct, but why are you only remembering those few agricultural counties when preparing for production now, and forgetting the words "industrial and mining area" here? Old Yin decided to write several letters to give his opinion! However, what to do now? Shuan Cheng also had no solution, so he had to reluctantly ask everyone to discuss it.
　　Everyone was also sitting there, stumped! After a long time, Liu Goujia suddenly said, "If there's no rice, can't we draw supplies? If there's nothing to eat, can't we go hungry?" But who would listen to her jokes at this time! Only Old Yin took her words to heart, and his heart stirred. He remembered that there were many workers in the nearby villages who were doing odd jobs, so he quickly said to the Little Foreign Devil next to him, "Can you reduce the wage payout? That might be a solution!" The Little Foreign Devil fluttered his eyelids twice, and his heart also stirred. He quickly ran to the vicinity of where Liu Goujia was sitting and shouted, "Everyone! I have an idea! I think we have to make this mine work no matter what! Whoever has food at home should not draw supplies, or draw less supplies, what do you think!" Liu Goujia: "Just say what you have to say, why are you spitting all over my face? Why don't you start by saying you won't draw supplies?" The Little Foreign Devil quickly shouted again: "But I have to make it clear: we can't do it. Our family of five only had two and a half pounds of rice a day to begin with. Now we're risking our lives to pump water, and we only get four pounds. @ Damn it, we eat more when we pump water, and there's nothing left in our jar!" Tai Cheng then also said: "Aren't we the same? Even though we have two or three laborers, we have a family of nine! We only get five pounds a day!" Third Grand Uncle looked at Tai Cheng, and got angry again. Luckily, Tian Lu held him back, but he still whispered to the people next to him, "Tai Cheng probably wants to earn nine pounds a day! He can't be happy unless he's earning more than he did when he was digging the West Mine himself!" Unexpectedly, Third Grand Uncle's words reached Tai Cheng's ears. He suddenly stood up and shouted, "Everyone is here! I didn't say anything to offend Third Grand Uncle, but he secretly said that I wanted to earn nine pounds! He said that I was unhappy because I wasn't earning as much as I did when I was digging the West Mine myself! Isn't this clearly trying to pick a fight with me again?" Third Grand Uncle was really angry, but Tian Lu tried his best to restrain him, so he had to turn his face away and breathe heavily through his nostrils. When Tai Cheng saw his appearance, he became even more energetic, and he blushed and clapped his hands and said, "Now we have democracy and equality. I earn as much wages as I do work. I didn't say that I was jealous that you, a bachelor, earned so much!" The Little Foreign Devil hurried up to pull Tai Cheng and said, "Are you taking a joke seriously? The mine is our own mine, and we all do the same work!" Tai Cheng refused to be pulled away, as if he had some great hatred for Third Grand Uncle, and wanted to vent it all at once. He still shouted, "Everyone says that one pound a day is fine with me! This is also a meeting discussion! I didn't slack off or be lazy!" People couldn't help but start to persuade, provoke, sigh, and shout curses mixed together. Niu Bao probably felt offended by Tai Cheng's words, so he also took advantage of the chaos and shouted loudly, "I think we should just have democracy and equality! No matter how tall or short, everyone gets three pounds a day! Anyway, the land is also divided equally! Besides, this can also reduce supply costs!" Liu Goujia said: "That's right! Three pounds a day, I'll have half a pound more a day!" Tai Cheng also said: "I agree! Let's make everything the same." Some of the miners had originally been secretly pushing Niu Bao's idea, and now that it was shouted out, people saw that the meeting couldn't be held, so they all started to act out, shouting and yelling. This one said, "Okay! One pound a day is fine!" That one said, "Let's just do three pounds! When the ventilation shaft is open and we earn more, everyone gets thirty pounds a day!" The Little Foreign Devil was so anxious that he couldn't stop everyone from shouting, so he also raised his voice and shouted, "Is this still a meeting? I think everyone should get a hundred pounds!" People were in piles here and groups there, waving their arms at you and shouting for a while, spitting at you and jumping up and down, sticking out their bellies for a while, and some people said, "Go back and tell your wife, your daughter, and your son to eat a bowl of rice each, counting the grains before putting them in the pot. No one is allowed to take more! Anyway, it's democracy and equality!" The Little Foreign Devil ran to grab Shuan Cheng and Old Yin and said, "You guys explain it to them! This is going to turn the world upside down!" But the two of them were discussing something and ignored him. When he turned around, he ran into someone shouting at him, so he angrily shouted again, "Let's all be equal! Each household should take out their pots, bowls, chopsticks, tattered clothes, and divide them equally!" Suddenly, a person jumped onto a stool and shouted, "Let's make it equal! Three pounds of rice a day for everyone, does everyone agree?" He saw the whole field shouting in one voice: "Agree!" Afterwards, there was laughter, scolding, shouting, and yelling. Third Grand Uncle suddenly said again, "I don't agree! I agree to supply according to population! I'm a bachelor, one pound a day is enough!" This provoked people to argue even more fiercely. In the end, Shuan Cheng managed to shout everyone to a stop.

    一会，林宝跑来给老尹送了封信，他顺便问道：“大三爷，你说这风筒得多时才能透？”大三没言声，小洋鬼道：“你这还不如问你自己多会死哩！”人们哄笑起来，小洋鬼忙又道：“甭笑嘛！这水火营生，黑着俩眼的谁能说准？”大三却撇过脸来道：“反正多也过不了一个月，这可跟人死不死的不一样！”嘉禄和林宝不觉同时叫了起来：“老天爷！”林宝接着说：“这可拿什么花销？柜上家当眼看就光了的！”大家不觉立时都瞪着眼没话说！借贷粮么？刚才老尹接到老白的信，信上说上边正有一批粮食往下贷，可通知上说那是农贷，是帮助分到地的贫苦农民解决籽种农具的，工矿上头暂时还不借给；老白在信上并说他一百个不同意这么办，他又提意见去了。老尹看着这信，又看着会上的情形，不觉仰着脖子，扑展着眼皮，也生了气；他想：前些时上边批评这里土地改革没注意工矿区的特点，倒是对的，但为什么现在准备生产，你自己倒光结记住了那几个农业县份，把这边“工矿区”三个字忘了？老尹决定要写好几封信提意见！不过，眼下怎么办呢？拴成也是没一点法，只得勉强叫大家讨论。
    大家也都是呆呆地蹩着！老大一会，柳沟家忽地说：“没米不兴不支供应？没吃的不兴饿着？”但这会还有谁听她的耍笑话啊！只有老尹听进了她的话，不禁心中一动，想起左近各村有不少工人花白工动弹的，于是他连忙对他旁边的小洋鬼道：“你能少支工资不？这倒是个法哩！”小洋鬼扑展了两下眼皮，也心中一动，忙跑到柳沟家坐的附近吆喝道：“大伙！我有个意见！我看咱这窑反正得破着命闹成！咱们谁家当下有吃的，就不支或是少支点供应，看这行不！”柳沟家：“你说就说嘛，怎么唾沫直往我脸上喷？你先说你不支行么？”小洋鬼忙又吆喝：“可话得说明白：咱可不行，咱一家五口，起先打点一天才二斤半米，这会破着老命打水，也才四斤；＠他妈的一打开水又吃得多，咱瓮里又没余没剩的！”泰成接着也道：“咱不一样？虽说劳力是两三个，可一家九口哩！咱一天也才五斤！”大三看了看泰成，又动了火，亏得天禄拉住了他，但他还是对旁边人们悄悄道：“泰成许是想一天挣九斤哩！明明这会没有他早先自个刨西窑挣得多，他就能舒心？”不想大三这话却传进了泰成耳朵里，他陡地往起一立，吆喝道：“这可是大伙都在！我又没说什么跟大三叔过不去的话，可他却悄悄说我想挣九斤！说我嫌这会没早先自个刨西窑挣得多！这不明明又是跟我闹蹩扭？”大三可也真动了气，但天禄使劲制住他，他只得撇过脸去俩鼻孔直出大气；泰成见他这模样，就更有了劲，又红着脸拍着马掌道：“这会兴的是民主平等，我干多少营生就挣多少工资，我也没说是看着你光棍一人挣得多就眼红呀！”小洋鬼忙上去拉住泰成说：“句把耍笑话你就当真？窑是自个的窑，又都干的一手营生的！”泰成不服拉，象是对大三有什么大仇气，要一下发泄干净一般，还嚷着：“大伙说我一天一斤也行呀！我这也是会场讨论的呀！我也没偷懒耍猾呀！”人们不觉劝说的、挑逗的、叹气的、嚷骂的混起来；牛宝许是泰成的话冲犯了他，就也趁乱劲大呼大叫道：“我看干脆民主平等！不管七长八短，一人一天三斤！反正地土也是平分的！再说这也能少花供应！”柳沟家道：“对！一人三斤，我一天还多半斤！”泰成也道：“我赞成！都闹成一样”窑黑们里头原本就有人暗里捣拉过牛宝这意见，现在一嚷开，人们见会也开不成了，就都闹开了别扭，一齐大嚷大闹，这个说：“行！一人一天一斤也行！”那个说：“就三斤吧！赶风筒透了挣多了，一人一天三十斤！”小洋鬼急得紧嚷也嚷不住大家，也就踊开嗓门吆喝道：“这还是不是开会哟！我看他妈一人一百斤吧！”人们这里一堆那里一伙，你对我挥着胳膊嚷一阵，他对你喷着唾沫跳起脚肚子一挺一挺地闹一气，还有人道：“回去叫你媳妇你闺女你小子一人吃一碗饭，数着米粒下锅，谁也不许多盛！反正是民主平等！”小洋鬼跑去抓住拴成老尹道：“你们快给解释解释吧！这这翻了天啦！”但他二人正商议什么，没搭理他，他回过头又正碰见个人对他嚷，他就又生气地嚷着：“咱们都市平他妈的吧！各家各户把锅盆碗筷破衣烂裳都拿出来平分了呀！”忽地一个人跳到凳子上一声吆喝：“咱们闹平它！一人一天三斤米，大伙赞成不？”只见全场一音喊道：“赞成！”过后又是笑骂叫嚷；大三却猛又说道：“我不赞成！我造成按人口闹供应！我光棍一个的，一天一斤就行！”这可又挑逗的人们咯吵得更厉害；最后还是拴成才把大家吆喝住。
