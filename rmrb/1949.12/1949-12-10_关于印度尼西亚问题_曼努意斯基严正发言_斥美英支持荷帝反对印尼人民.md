　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: TASS, New York—Manuilsky, head of the Ukrainian Republic delegation, delivered a speech on the Indonesian question to the Ad Hoc Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 3rd.
    Manuilsky first pointed out that the Ukrainian delegation had put forward a five-point proposal on the Indonesian question. The Ukrainian delegation cannot agree to the proposal put forward here by the delegations of Australia, Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt and other countries and defended by the Indian representative.
    Subsequently, Manuilsky refuted the Dutch representative's assertion that the resolutions of the so-called Hague Conference had satisfied the interests of the Indonesian people. He said: The war waged by the Dutch aggressors, supported by the United States and Britain, against the Indonesian people is now being waged with no less cruelty than in the past. The Dutch aggressors, armed with almost the most modern military equipment supplied by the United States, are using tanks, planes, and artillery to wage a war of aggression against the Indonesian people.

    斥美英支持荷帝反对印尼人民
    【新华社北京九日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：乌克兰共和国代表团团长曼努意斯基，三日在联合国大会特别政治委员会上发表关于印度尼西亚问题的演说。
    曼努意斯基首先指出，乌克兰代表团已提出关于印尼问题的五点提案。乌克兰代表团不能同意代表奥大利亚、阿富汗、缅甸、埃及和其他国家代表团在此间提出并由印度代表加以辩护的提案。
    继而，曼努意斯基驳斥了荷兰代表关于所谓海牙会议的决议已满足印尼人民利益的断言。他说：受到美国和英国支持的荷兰侵略者所从事的反对印尼人民的战争，现正以不亚于已往的残忍性在进行中。由美国供给的几乎是最现代化的军事装备所武装起来的荷兰侵略者，正利用坦克、飞机和大炮进行反对印尼人民的侵略性战争。
