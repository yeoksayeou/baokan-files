Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th: TASS Moscow, December 29th: The newspaper *Izvestia* published an editorial entitled "Capitalist Economy Plunged into Irresolvable Contradictions," pointing out: As 1950 approaches, the capitalist economy presents a rather unsightly picture. In the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, the economy is moving forward with confidence, while in capitalist countries, especially in the United States, production is declining, unemployment is growing, economic chaos and anarchy are intensifying, and signs of an impending economic crisis are emerging.

The editorial continued: The increasingly imminent economic crisis exposes the ugliness and absurdity of the capitalist economy with new force. The capitalist economy follows the principle of ensuring huge profits for the exploiters and violates the interests of the people. The masses are falling into poverty, while the warehouses of monopoly capitalists are piled high with goods that cannot find a market. The more hopeless the situation of the imperialists, the more they place their hopes on military adventures. American monopoly capitalist tycoons regard the arms race, especially the US military "aid" plan to Western Europe, as a means of maintaining their immense profits. The policy of preparing for war is reflected in the so-called "Marshall Plan." The American imperialists want to "prevent the crisis" by using this plan to enslave Western Europe and turn it into an American colonial dependency.

However, what is the reality? In reality, the "Marshall Plan" accelerated the arrival of the crisis, and all aspects of the European and American imperialist economies are increasingly showing signs of crisis. The current level of industrial production in Western Europe as a whole is the same as it was twenty years ago. The number of unemployed and semi-employed people in the capitalist world today is no less than 40 million. The failure of the "Marshall Plan" once again exposes and emphasizes how decadent and bankrupt the capitalist system is. After suffering repeated failures in economic development, capitalist countries are trying to find a way out in new wars.

The editorial concluded that in the greatest competition between the two systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system—people can clearly see the superiority of the socialist system. The socialist system is developing with increasing prosperity and shows, by its very existence, the decline of the imperialist system and the coming of its end.

　　资本主义经济陷入了无可解决的矛盾
    【新华社北京三十日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：消息报以“资本主义经济陷入了无可解决的矛盾”为题发表社论，指出：当此面临一九五○年的时候，资本主义经济呈现出一幅颇不雅观的景象。在苏联和人民民主国家，经济是满怀信心地向前迈进，而在资本主义国家，首先是在美国，生产正在下降，失业正在增长，经济的混乱和无政府状态正在加紧，即将到来的经济危机的病征正在出现。
    社论继称：日益迫近的经济危机，以新的力量暴露了资本主义经济的全部丑恶与荒诞。资本主义经济是遵循着保证剥削者获得巨额利润的原则，并且是违反人民利益的原则的。群众正在陷于贫穷的困境，而垄断资本家的仓库则堆满了找不到市场的货物。帝国主义者的情况越是没有希望，他们就越把希望寄托在军事冒险上。美国垄断资本大亨们把军备竞赛、特别是把美国军事“援助”西欧的计划，看作是保持他们的庞大无比的利润的手段。准备战争的政策表现在所谓“马歇尔计划”上。美帝国主义者想靠这个奴役西欧并把它变为美国殖民地附庸的计划来“防止危机”。
    然而，实际上是怎样呢？实际上“马歇尔计划”加速了危机的降临，欧美帝国主义经济的各方面都越来越使人感觉到危机的征候。现在西欧的工业生产水平，整个说来和二十年前一样。目前资本主义世界各国失业与半失业人数，不下四千万。“马歇尔计划”的失败，再次地暴露和着重地说明了资本主义制度是如何腐朽与破产。在经济发展方面遭受了接连不断的失败后，资本主义国家就力图在新的战争中寻找出路。
    社论结语称，在两个制度——社会主义制度与资本主义制度的最大的竞赛中，人们明显地看出社会主义制度的优越性。社会主义制度在日益昌盛地发展着，并以其存在来表明帝国主义制度的衰亡及其末日的来临。
