Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. Since the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions was established more than half a year ago, it has organized more than 700,000 of the city's 1.2 million workers; more than 900 factories and industries have established trade unions or trade union preparatory committees. The trade union branches for seamen, railways, municipal administration, printing, clothing, catering, and some spinning mills have been formally established. To this end, the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions decided on the 22nd of last month to organize a preparatory office for the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and issued a notice deciding to convene a citywide employee representative meeting on New Year's Day 1950 to formally establish the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions.
