Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 15th: To celebrate the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin, the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" journal of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has published a special celebratory issue today. The journal prominently features Chen Boda's special article written to celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday: "Stalin and the Chinese Revolution," as well as Stalin's speech at the meeting of the Chinese Committee of the Executive Committee of the Communist International on November 30, 1926: "On the Future of the Chinese Revolution," and Liu Shaoqi's speech at the celebration of the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution on November 7th this year: "On the World Influence of the October Revolution and the Chinese Revolution." Other contributors to the journal with articles and poems of congratulation include Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, He Xiangning, Wu Yuzhang, Mao Dun, Li Dequan, Xu Deheng, Xiao San, and others. All the poems and articles enthusiastically congratulate Marshal Stalin on his 70th birthday, praise Stalin's revolutionary doctrine, and thank Stalin and the Soviet people under his leadership for their great assistance to the Chinese Revolution.

　　Soong Ching Ling, in her congratulatory short article, cheered "Long live Stalin, produced by the people!" "Long live Stalin's leadership in the liberation of all mankind!" and called on everyone to learn from Stalin, from his people, and from his party.

　　Li Jishen's article stated: Marshal Stalin and the Soviet people under his leadership have provided the Chinese Revolution with many unforgettable concrete aids. This assistance is still continuing and expanding, helping us to build the Chinese people's own new country. When drinking water, remember the source. We deeply express our respect and gratitude for this selfless friendship, especially for Marshal Stalin's remarkable foresight on the Chinese Revolution and his encouragement and support for the cause of world people's liberation.

　　Zhang Lan wrote: Stalin seeks liberation for mankind, seeks peace and happiness for mankind, and seeks true freedom for mankind. Naturally, mankind wholeheartedly loves, supports, and prays for him.

　　Shen Junru's article stated: The interests of the people of the world are inseparable from Marshal Stalin. For the interests of the Chinese people and for the interests of the people of the world, we wish Marshal Stalin longevity and health.

　　He Xiangning, in her article, listed various facts, emphasizing that the victory of the Chinese Revolution is inseparable from Stalin's name. The article stated: "When the Chinese people were in the most difficult times, it was the Soviet Union that extended a friendly hand to the Chinese people. When the Chinese people were most in need of help, it was the Soviet Union that immediately gave the Chinese people unconditional and most selfless assistance. In the Chinese People's Revolution over the past twenty years, and in the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution today, can any historical fact be separated from the assistance of our Chinese people's most sincere friend? And all this is inseparable from Stalin's glorious name."

　　Wu Yuzhang's article pointed out: Stalin's revolutionary theory is also the source of the victory of the Chinese Revolution.

　　Mao Dun's article stated: "The people of the world are increasingly understanding that if they do not want to be enslaved, do not want to be cannon fodder for war mongers, then they can only resolutely support the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and fight together. The people of the world are today warmly celebrating Stalin's 70th birthday, which demonstrates this understanding and determination!"

　　Li Dequan's article stated: "Now the remaining forces of imperialism are frantically preparing for a new war. We must cooperate closely with the Soviet people, unite all peace-loving and democratic nations, fight together, strengthen and expand the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and lay the foundation for lasting peace for all mankind."

　　Xu Deheng's article stated: We in the new China of people's democracy are especially excited to celebrate Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday in this year of our birth. In the future, our new China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, will learn from the 32 years of Soviet experience in national construction and quickly transform from a backward agricultural country into a brand-new industrial country.

　　The congratulatory poems written by Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Xiao San, and others also warmly praised Stalin's great life.

　　In addition, the journal also carries a brief biography of Stalin written by Zhang Zhongshi, which briefly narrates Stalin's life and activities in various historical periods before and after the October Revolution.

    宋庆龄在她的庆祝短文中欢呼“人民所产生的斯大林万岁！”“斯大林对全人类解放的领导万岁！”并号召大家向斯大林，向他的人民和他的党学习。
    李济深的文章说：斯大林大元帅和他领导下的苏联人民，曾经予中国革命许多永不能忘的具体援助，现在这种援助尚在继续与扩大，帮助我们建设中国人民自己的新国家。饮水思源，我们对这种大公无私的友情，尤其对斯大林大元帅对中国革命的卓异远见和他对世界人民解放事业之鼓励与扶助，不能不深致其崇敬与感激。
    张澜著文说：斯大林为人类谋解放，为人类谋和平幸福，为人类谋真正的自由，人类对他当然竭诚的爱护、拥戴、祝祷。
    沈钧儒的文章说：全世界人民的利益是和斯大林大元帅分不开的，为了中国人民的利益，为了全世界人民的利益，祝斯大林大元帅长寿和健康。
    何香凝在文章中列举各种事实，强调指出中国革命的胜利是和斯大林的名字分不开的。该文说：“当着中国人民最困难的时候，向中国人民伸出友谊的手的，就是苏联。当着中国人民最需要帮助的时候，立即给予中国人民无条件的最不自私的帮助的，就是苏联。二十多年来的中国人民革命，以及今天中国人民革命的胜利，有那一段史实能和我们中国人民最真诚的朋友的帮助分得开的？而这一切，都是和斯大林的光荣名字分不开的。”
    吴玉章的文章指出：斯大林的革命理论，也就是中国革命胜利的源泉。
    茅盾的文章说：“全世界的人民愈来愈明白：如果不愿被奴役，不愿给战争贩子当炮灰，那就只有坚决地拥护以苏联为首的和平民主阵营而共同奋斗，全世界的人民今天热烈地庆祝着斯大林的七十寿辰。就表示了这样的认识和决心！”
    李德全的文章说：“现在帝国主义的残余势力又在猖狂地准备新的战争。我们必须与苏联人民密切合作，团结一切爱好和平民主的民族，共同奋斗，加强与扩大以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，为全世界人类奠定永久和平的基础。”
    许德珩的文章说：在我们人民民主的新中国诞生的这一年，欣逢斯大林大元帅的七十生辰，中国更感到兴奋。今后我们新中国，在毛主席领导之下，将学会苏联三十二年的建国经验，很快由一个落后的农业国变成一个崭新的工业国。
