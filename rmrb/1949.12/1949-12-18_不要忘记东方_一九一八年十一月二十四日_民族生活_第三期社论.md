　　Do Not Forget the East
    ——Editorial of "National Life" Issue 3, November 24, 1918
    Joseph Stalin
    After the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, Stalin served as the Minister of the People's Commissariat for Nationalities Affairs of the Soviet Government until 1923. This article is an editorial written by Stalin for the third issue of the ministry's newspaper "National Life" on November 24, 1918. From this, it can be seen that Stalin was very concerned about the fate of the Chinese people as early as 1918.

    At a time when the European revolutionary movement is surging, the old thrones and crowns are collapsing one after another, giving way to the revolutionary committees of workers and soldiers, and the occupied areas are driving out the running dogs of imperialism from their territories, everyone's attention is naturally turned to the West. There, in the West, a new socialist life should first begin with a storm. At such a time, the Far East and its hundreds of millions of people enslaved by imperialism "disappear" from view and are forgotten.

    However, it is impossible to forget the East even for a minute, even because it is the "inexhaustible" reserve force and "most reliable" rear of world imperialism.

    The imperialists regard the East as the foundation of their happiness. Aren't the incalculable natural resources of Eastern countries (cotton, oil, gold, coal, iron ore) the "apple of discord" (Note 1) for the imperialists of various countries? Frankly speaking, this can explain why the imperialists never forgot China, India, Persia, Egypt, and Morocco when they were fighting and talking in Europe, because frankly speaking, they were always concerned about the East. This mainly explains why they are so enthusiastic about maintaining "order and law" in Eastern countries, without which the far-reaching rear of imperialism is not guaranteed.

    However, what the imperialists need is not only the resources of the East. What they need is the large number of "docile" "talents" in the Eastern colonies and semi-colonies. What they need is the "attentive" and cheap "manpower" of the Eastern nations. In addition, what they need are the "docile" "young friends" of the Eastern countries, from whom they recruit so-called "colored" troops, immediately using them against "their own" revolutionary workers. Therefore, they call the Eastern countries their "inexhaustible" reserve force.

    The task of communism is to smash the long sleep of the oppressed nations of the East, to infect the workers and peasants of these countries with the revolutionary spirit of liberation, to incite them to fight against imperialism, and thereby deprive world imperialism of its "most reliable" rear and its "inexhaustible" reserve force.

    Without this, there can be no talk of the final victory of socialism, no talk of completely defeating imperialism.

    The Russian revolution was the first to stir up the oppressed nations of the East against imperialism. The representative conferences of Persia, India, and China are the first signs that the long sleep of the workers and peasants of the East is about to pass.

    The revolution in the West has undoubtedly given the revolutionary movement in the East a new impetus, infusing them with a heroic spirit and confidence in victory.

    The imperialists themselves and their new annexations are providing a lot of assistance to the revolutionary transformation of the East, which is drawing new countries into the anti-imperialist struggle and expanding the foundation of the world revolution.

    The task of the communists is to participate in the growing spontaneous movement in the East, to develop this movement, and to make it a conscious anti-imperialist struggle.

    In this sense, the resolution of the recent conference of Muslim communists (Note 2) on strengthening propaganda work in Eastern countries—Persia, India, and China—undoubtedly has profound revolutionary significance.

    We hope that our Muslim comrades can implement their highly important decisions.

    Because it is necessary to always understand the truth that: whoever desires the victory of socialism cannot forget the East.

　　(Translated by Zhang Zhongshi from Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Volume 4, pages 171-173)
    (Note 1) This is from Greek mythology, which says that the three goddesses, Hera, Aphrodite, and Athena, took the golden apple to the shepherd Paris and asked him to judge who was the most beautiful and give the apple to whom. Paris gave the apple to Aphrodite, and since then, this apple has become the root of discord between Aphrodite and the two goddesses, Hera and Athena. This saying is transformed into the source of discord or the seed of jealousy.

　　不要忘记东方
    ——一九一八年十一月二十四日“民族生活”第三期社论
    斯大林
    在十月社会主义革命胜利以后，斯大林曾任苏维埃政府民族事务人民委员部部长，直至一九二三年。本文系斯大林于一九一八年十一月二十四日为该部机关报“民族生活”第三期所写的社论。从这里可以看出，斯大林在一九一八年就很关心中国人民的命运。

    当日益高涨的欧洲革命运动的时候，旧的王座王冠纷纷瓦解，而让位给工人和士兵的革命委员会，被占领的地区从自己的地域内赶走了帝国主义的走狗，这时大家的视线，自然是朝向西方了。在那里，在西方，首先应当有暴风雨般的新的社会主义生活了。在这样的时际，远东和其数万万被帝国主义所奴役的人口，从视野中“自行”消失了，被忘记了。
    可是，忘记东方连一分钟也不行的，即使因为它是世界帝国主义的“取之不尽”的后备力量和“最可靠的”后方。
    帝国主义者们是把东方视作自己幸福的基础。东方各国的不可计算的天然富源（棉花、石油、金子、煤、铁矿），难道对各国帝国主义者们不是“倾轧的苹果”（注一）吗？老实说，这就可以说明，帝国主义者们在欧洲打仗和空谈西方时，从未忘怀中国、印度、波斯、埃及、摩洛哥，因为老实说他们是时时关心东方的。这主要地就可以说明，他们为何那样热心地维持东方各国的“秩序和法律”，没有这，帝国主义的深远后方是没有保证的。
    不过，对帝国主义者们所需要的不仅是东方的富源而已。它们所需要的是东方殖民地和半殖民地所有的大量的“温顺的”“人才”。它们所需要的是东方各民族的“殷勤的”和低廉的“人手”。此外，它们所需要的是东方各国的“温顺的”“青年朋友”，它们从这种“青年朋友”中征募所谓“有色”军队，立即无用它们去反对 “自己的本国的” 革命工人。所以，它们把东方各国叫做自己的“取之不尽”的后备力量。
    共产主义的任务，就在粉碎东方各被压迫民族的长久沉睡，以解放的革命精神感染这些国家的工人和农民，掀起他们来和帝国主义作斗争，并以此剥夺世界帝国主义的“最可靠的”后方，它的“取之不尽”的后备力量。
    没有这，就谈不到社会主义的最终胜利，谈不到完全战胜帝国主义了。
    俄国的革命头一次掀起了东方各被压迫民族去反对帝国主义。波斯、印度、中国的代表会议是东方工人农民的长久沉睡行将成为过去的头一个标志。
    西方的革命，无疑地，给了东方的革命运动一个新的推动，给他们贯注了英勇的精神和胜利的信心。
    帝国主义者们自己和他们的新的兼并对东方革命化的事情正在给予不少的援助，这种兼并把新的国度卷入反帝国主义斗争之中，而扩大了世界革命的基础。
    共产主义者的任务，就在参与东方日益增长的自发运动事情，向前发展这一运动，使之成为自觉的反帝国主义的斗争。
    在这个意义上，不久以前举行的回人共产主义者代表会议（注二）关于加强东方各国——波斯、印度、中国宣传工作的决议案，无疑地有着深刻的革命意义。
    我们希望，我们的回人同志能执行自己的高度重要的决定。
    因为需要永远领会这个真理，即：谁愿望社会主义胜利，那谁就不能忘记东方。
　　（张仲实译自斯大林全集，俄文版，第四卷一七一—一七三页）
    （注一）系希腊神话，说海娜、亚夫罗德、亚典三个女神拿了金苹果到牧童巴里斯处，叫他评判谁最美丽，就把苹果给谁。巴里斯把苹果给与亚夫罗德，自此，此苹果就成了亚夫罗德与海娜和雅典两个女神之间不和之根源。此话转为不和之源或忌妒之种子。

    （注二）系指一九二八年十一月莫斯科所举行的回人共产党员第一次大会而言。大会选举了俄国共产党（布）回人组织中央局。
