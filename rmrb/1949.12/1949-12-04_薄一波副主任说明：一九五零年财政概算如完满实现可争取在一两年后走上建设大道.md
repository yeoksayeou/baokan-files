Vice Chairman Bo Yibo Explains:
	If the 1950 Fiscal Budget is Fully Realized, We Can Strive to Embark on the Road to Construction in One or Two Years
	Following this, Vice Chairman Bo Yibo made an explanation regarding the basic spirit of the draft national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget for 1950 and the guarantees for realizing this budget. Vice Chairman Bo first explained that although this draft budget was compiled based on incomplete materials plus empirical estimates, it is close to the facts. He pointed out that the fiscal task for 1950 is first and foremost to ensure the needs of the war victory. He then explained that the People's Government cannot but take over all the old army and old public employees, providing them with food so as to gradually transform them, and prepare to shift to economic construction within one or two years. However, this means that in 1950, the country is estimated to have to supply 9 million military, government, and public education personnel, which is why military and administrative expenses account for more than 60 percent of the total expenditure budget, with direct and indirect expenditures for military and government personnel accounting for the most significant portion. Economic construction investment used for restoring production accounts for 23.9 percent of the expenditure budget. Vice Chairman Bo pointed out that this draft budget takes into account both spending according to income and earning according to expenditure, and takes it reasonably and uses it appropriately. If this budget can be fully realized, it will be beneficial to stabilizing people's livelihoods and developing production, and the price situation next year will be much better than this year. However, to fully realize this draft, serious struggles are still needed. Vice Chairman Li Fuchun of the Northeast People's Government and Committee Members Rao Shushi and Deng Zihui of the Central People's Government unanimously expressed their support for this draft budget in their reports, and stated that each major administrative region will work hard to complete the tasks assigned to each region by this budget. Based on the experience of the Northeast, Vice Chairman Li Fuchun specifically pointed out that by stepping up efforts and implementing this budget, we can strive to get the new China on the road to construction in one or two years.

　　薄一波副主任说明：
    一九五零年财政概算如完满实现可争取在一两年后走上建设大道
    接着薄一皮副主任就一九五零年度全国财政收支概算草案的基本精神和实现这个概算的保证作了一个说明。薄副主任首先说明，这个概算草案虽是根据不完全的材料加上经验推算估计编成的，但是接近事实的。他指出一九五零年度的财政任务，首先仍然是保证战争胜利的需要。他接着说明，人民政府不能不把所有的旧军队旧公教人员一齐包下来，给他们饭吃，以便逐渐加以改造，并且准备在一、二年内转入经济建设。但是这样就使得一九五零年度全国估计要供给军政公教人员九百万人，因此也就使得军事费和行政费占了全部支出概算的百分之六十强，其中军政人员直接间接的开支占了最主要的部分。用在恢复生产上的经济建设投资占支出概算的百分之二十三点九。薄副主任指出，这个概算草案兼顾了量出为入和量入为出，并且取之合理，用之得当。这个概算如能完满实现，对安定民生和发展生产是有利的，明年的物价状况也将比今年好得多。但是要使这个草案完满实现，还需要进行严重的斗争。东北人民政府李富春副主席和中央人民政府饶漱石、邓子恢两委员在他们的报告中一致表示拥护这个概算草案，并且表示各大行政区一定为完成这个概算所给予他们每一个地区的任务而努力。李富春副主席根据东北的经验特别指出，照这个概算加紧努力，贯彻实施可以争取新中国在一、二年之后走上建设的大道。
