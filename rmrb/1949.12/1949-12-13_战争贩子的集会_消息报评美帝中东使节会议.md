　　Assembly of Warmongers
  　Izvestia Comments on the US Imperialist Envoys' Meeting
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th] According to TASS, Moscow: Izvestia published an article by Osipov on the 5th, discussing the recent meeting of US diplomatic personnel from Near Eastern and Middle Eastern countries in Istanbul, considering this meeting to be an assembly of warmongers.
    Osipov pointed out that the plans of US monopoly capital include acquiring new oil concessions and controlling the entire economy of Near Eastern countries. These plans are connected with the military aggressive measures of US imperialism and plans to establish a Near Eastern bloc of nations. How to oppose the growing national liberation movements of the oppressed peoples of the Near East and Middle East also occupies a significant position on the agenda of this meeting.
    The American emissaries have accepted the task of turning the Near Eastern countries into bridgeheads and bases for the US Army, Navy, and Air Force. US imperialists are encouraging the governments of the Near Eastern countries to take measures to create a "Collective Security Treaty of Arab States," which is designed to be the foundation for organizing a broader aggressive alliance including Turkey, Greece, Iran, and other countries.
    Osipov further pointed out that despite the joint plans of the US and Britain to use the territories of the Near Eastern countries for aggressive purposes, and despite their common goal in opposing national liberation movements, the Near East remains a stage where the interests of US and British imperialism clash fiercely. This explains why the news about the Istanbul meeting of US diplomatic personnel and the recent US economic measures in the Near East did not arouse enthusiasm in London. The Labor government suspects that the Istanbul meeting is pursuing some anti-British goals connected with the interests of US oil monopolies, and this is not without reason. This is why Britain is hastily taking certain measures in the Near East and Middle East to maintain its position and erect some barriers against the US offensive.
    The author concludes: The struggle of the peoples of all countries who desire peace, freedom, and independence, and who oppose the reactionary, imperialist, and war camp, is not relaxed for a moment in the Near East. No matter what resolutions the Istanbul warmonger meeting passes, the peoples of the Near Eastern countries, having tasted the suffering inflicted by the colonizers, are unwilling to serve as cannon fodder for war instigators.

### 战争贩子的集会　消息报评美帝中东使节会议

　　战争贩子的集会
  　消息报评美帝中东使节会议
    【新华社北京十二日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报五日刊载奥西波夫的专文，论述最近在伊斯坦堡举行的美国驻近东、中东各国外交人员会议，认为这次会议是战争贩子的集会。
    奥西波夫指出，美国垄断资本的计划包括获取新石油特许权，控制近东各国的全部经济。这些计划是与美国帝国主义的军事侵略性措施以及建立近东国家集团的计划相联系的。如何反对近东、中东被压迫民族日益增长的民族解放运动，在这次会议的议程上也占着显著的地位。
    美国的密使们已接受任务，要把近东各国变为美国陆、海、空军的桥头堡垒和基地。美国帝国主义者正在鼓励近东诸国政府采取措施，以图创建“阿拉伯国家集体安全公约”，该公约被设计成为组织包括土耳其、希腊、伊朗及其他国家在内的更广泛的侵略联盟的基础。
    奥西波夫进而指出：尽管美英有把近东各国领土用于侵略目的的联合计划，尽管它们在反对民族解放运动中有着共同的目的，但是，近东依然是美英帝国主义的利益发生激烈冲突的舞台。这说明为什么关于美国外交人员伊斯坦堡会议的消息，以及最近美国在近东的经济措施引不起伦敦的热诚的原因。工党政府猜疑伊斯坦堡会议追逐某种与美国石油垄断公司的利益有联系的反英目的，这不是没有根据的。英国所以急急忙忙在近东、中东采取某些措施，以保持其地位和树立起某些抵御美国进攻的壁垒，其原因就在这里。
    作者结语称：愿望和平、自由与独立，反对反动派、帝国主义与战争阵营的各国人民的斗争，在近东是片刻也不放松的。不论伊斯坦堡战争贩子会议通过了什么决议，备尝殖民者所给予的痛苦的近东各国人民，却不愿充当战争挑拨者的炮灰。
