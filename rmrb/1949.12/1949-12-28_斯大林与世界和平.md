　　Stalin and World Peace
　　Qian Junrui
　　I. The Central Task of the People of the World Today is to Strive for a Solid and Lasting Peace
　　In the past half-century, the people of all countries have experienced two world wars. In the two world wars, tens of millions of people were killed and wounded, and hundreds of millions had their houses burned, starved, and froze; the number of people who died of illness and starvation was countless. Factories, workshops, and farms were destroyed in large numbers. Except for a very small number of capitalists and landlords, everyone in the world lived a miserable and terrible life at that time. This is one aspect of the result of the two world wars launched by the imperialist aggressors. This world war is a product of the development of capitalism to its highest stage, namely imperialism. Before imperialism, mankind had many wars, but there would not have been, and could never have been, world wars at that time, because at that time, no reactionary rule could have the world-wide rule of financial capital like the imperialist era. After the imperialist era is over, world wars will certainly be gone, and even war itself will be eliminated. Because war is a product of the system of exploitation, the socialist era that replaces the imperialist era will eliminate the system of exploitation and eliminate the root cause of war. Therefore, war will not be able to occur at that time.

　　Since ancient times, the masses of people in all countries have always loved peace. However, it was not until the birth of Marxism a hundred years ago that the real way to eliminate war was found, that is: led by the proletariat, uniting the broad masses of working people, and organizing revolutionary struggles to overthrow the reactionary classes' system of oppression and exploitation, and to dig out the roots of launching wars. Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin, they were all great warriors and leaders who opposed war and organized true peace.

　　Before and during the First World War, Lenin and Stalin most resolutely opposed this imperialist war, and called on, led, and organized revolutionary struggles in various countries to oppose it. This struggle first succeeded in one-sixth of the world's land. The Russian landlord and bourgeois class's policy of continuing the imperialist war was interrupted by the October Socialist Revolution, thus creating the first socialist country in human history, the Soviet Union.

　　Before and during the Second World War, Stalin most resolutely opposed this war of aggression launched by the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist imperialists, and called on, led, and organized the world's people's anti-fascist war to oppose it. As a result, the fascist war of aggression failed, and the people's anti-fascist war won, thus opening up a broad road for world lasting peace.

　　Now, not long after the end of the Second World War, the U.S. and British imperialist blocs are about to take the old road of Wilhelm II and Hitler, desperately organizing new wars, and attempting to threaten all mankind once again with the deaths of millions of people and the destruction of human civilization. The leaders leading these murderers are Truman, Marshall, Dulles, Churchill, and Bevin, and the real masters behind these leaders are the financial giants of Wall Street and the London "City."

　　This is the biggest threat pressing on the heads of all mankind today. The most urgent and central task of the people of all countries today is to strive to oppose this threat of new war and defend and consolidate world peace. Only when the people of all countries in the world win in this great struggle can they ensure the independent and free life of each country and nation, carry out the construction of material and spiritual happiness, have friendly cooperation between all nations based on complete equality and mutual assistance, and gradually move towards the world commonwealth that all mankind desires.

　　II. Stalin's Policy is a Policy of Peace

　　Stalin, the best successor of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, his entire doctrine and actions are to satisfy the greatest and most long-term interests of all mankind. The deceased Dimitrov once said: "Just as the working class is international, so is Stalin; just as Bolshevism is international, so is Stalin; just as Marxism-Leninism is international, so is Stalin; the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism points out the path of liberation to all the exploited and oppressed people in the world, and Stalin's theory and practice include the interests of workers of all countries, all nationalities, and all races." (Stalin and the International Proletariat)

　　The Soviet Union, which was built under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, and after Lenin's death, under the leadership of Stalin, is a strong fortress against imperialism and a strong fortress for world peace. Stalin inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism, led the Soviet people to build socialism in a peaceful environment, allowed the Soviet people to live a free and happy life, and provided the people of the world with a strong backing and a strong base to facilitate their struggle to change the social system of their own countries and dig out the roots of war. This is one aspect.

　　On the other hand, the socialist Soviet Union, at the beginning of its founding, announced its peace policy. In November 1917, the first action of the Soviet state was to announce the Decree on Peace on concluding a just and democratic peace. Under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet Union has always consistently pursued this peace policy, and has unyieldingly opposed all attempts and actions to undermine peace with the greatest determination and strength, and resolutely defended the cause of world peace. The Soviet Union's peace policy is based on the Soviet Union's socialist system and the interests of the Soviet people. Since the socialist society has abolished the system of man exploiting man and man oppressing man, and created fraternal friendship and cooperation between different nations and different races, it certainly does not need to exploit and oppress other countries and other nations, does not need to expand outwards, and does not need to plunder colonies. Precisely because the socialist social system has eliminated the roots of unemployment and economic crises (the contradiction between the social nature of production and capitalist private ownership), the socialist Soviet Union will never need to use the method of launching wars to escape any economic crisis, as imperialist countries do. This is why the Soviet people are so consistently and resolutely opposed to war and defend peace.

　　Stalin's peace policy is not only suitable for the interests of the Soviet people, but also suitable for the interests of all peace-loving countries, and suitable for the interests of all mankind. This peace policy is manifested in the Soviet Union's foreign policy, which is to strive for international peaceful cooperation with all its strength and to ensure the security of all countries. Stalin is the creator of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. The Second Soviet Congress passed the Decree on Peace on November 8, 1917, and appealed to the working classes and the masses of people of all countries: "To successfully carry out the cause of peace and the cause of freeing the oppressed working masses from all enslavement and all exploitation." When Japanese imperialism attacked our Northeast in 1931, the Soviet Union was the first to oppose this war of aggression and launched sanctions against Japan by various countries. The Soviet Union joined the then League of Nations in 1934. Stalin analyzed this matter in this way: "Although the League of Nations is weak, it can still be used as a platform to expose aggressors, as a tool for peace that, although weak, can still hinder the spread of war." In March 1939, Stalin further explained the peace policy, saying: "We maintain peace and advocate strengthening our country's commercial relations with all countries in the world, as long as these countries also maintain the same relations with the Soviet Union and do not attempt to infringe upon our country's interests, we will always maintain this position." At that time, the imperialists were frantically carrying out an arms race, and the Japanese and Italian imperialists had already launched wars of aggression against China and Abyssinia. The British and French appeasers were desperately organizing wars against the Soviet Union. In this extremely difficult situation, the Soviet Union, loyal to the cause of peace, resolutely signed non-aggression treaties and mutual assistance pacts with many countries (such as the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact and the Soviet-Czech Mutual Assistance Pact in 1935; the Soviet-Mongolian Mutual Assistance Pact in 1936; the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in 1937); even on the eve of the fascist Germany and Japan launching attacks on the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union signed non-aggression and neutrality pacts with them to stop and delay their wars of aggression. As Stalin said: "Amidst the stormy waves of this great economic change and military and political catastrophe, the Soviet Union still stood firm, continuing its cause of socialist construction and the struggle to maintain peace." Everyone knows that the Soviet Union's struggle in those years had great gains. They educated the broad masses of people in the Soviet Union and the world, allowing them to gradually recognize the sinister faces of the fascist aggressors, which greatly helped the formation and development of the world's anti-fascist united front in World War II.

　　III. Stalin is the Creator and Leader of the World Peace Camp

　　In the Second World War, the anti-fascist united front led by the Soviet Union defeated fascist Germany, Japan, and Italy. All freedom-loving and peace-loving people in the world directly and indirectly participated in that sacred and great anti-fascist war. Why did they actively participate in this just anti-fascist war? The purpose of their participation, as Stalin declared on November 6, 1941, was to: "Eliminate racial discrimination; equality of all nations and the inviolability of their territories; liberate all enslaved nations and restore their sovereignty; allow all nations to live their lives according to their own wishes; provide economic assistance to oppressed nations and practically help them obtain material happiness; restore freedom."

　　This battle program issued by Stalin when the anti-fascist war was at its most difficult became the program for the peaceful struggle of the people of all countries after World War II, and it has become the action program for mobilizing and organizing all peace-loving and democratic forces to strive for lasting peace for several years and in the future. This program was specifically manifested in the Yalta Agreement signed by Stalin himself. This agreement solemnly stated: "Only through the continued development of common cooperation and mutual understanding between our three countries can the highest aspiration of mankind—a firm and lasting peace—be realized." Based on the same spirit, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States also signed the Tehran Agreement and the Potsdam Agreement. Under the leadership of Stalin's peace policy, the Soviet Union has faithfully implemented these agreements and, in accordance with these agreements, demanded the early signing of peace treaties with Germany and Japan. Under the leadership of Stalin's peace policy, the Soviet Union has most actively participated in the work of the United Nations, exposing and countering all conspiracies from the imperialist bloc to undermine the foundation of the United Nations, and at the successive UN General Assemblies and Foreign Ministers' Conferences, has done its best to expose the various tricks of the new war instigators, oppose the propaganda of new war, and oppose the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is a tool for organizing new wars. Under the leadership of Stalin's peace policy, since 1946, the Soviet Union has put forward many effective steps to safeguard peace to the UN General Assembly, such as the proposal for universal disarmament and reduction of armed forces, the proposal to ban atomic weapons, the proposal to condemn war propaganda, the proposal to reduce the armed forces and armaments of the five major powers by one-third, and the proposal put forward in September this year to sign a peace pact to strengthen peace by the five powers of the United States, Britain, China, France, and the Soviet Union, etc. Stalin also personally proposed in his letter to Smith to conclude a Soviet-American peace treaty.

　　Under the call of Stalin's peace policy, the people of all countries in the world have gradually mobilized and organized themselves in order to oppose the serious threat of new war. Stalin once said in response to a question raised by Agi Kimball, a reporter from the United Press: "I firmly believe that no nation and their army wants a new war. They want peace and are willing to work for peace. In order to maintain peace and tranquility in the world, it is necessary to expose the instigators of new war in time, so that they do not have the opportunity to misuse their power to oppose the interests of peace." Stalin's unwavering confidence and his call, which conformed to the true wishes of the people of all countries, encouraged and promoted the conscious unity of all peace-loving forces in the world to oppose the danger of new war and defend world peace.

　　In April 1949, representatives from 57 countries around the world, representing 12 international organizations and 561 national organizations, representing more than 600 million organized workers, farmers, intellectuals, and other peace-loving people around the world, held a World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Paris and Prague. At this congress, thousands of representatives, in various languages, shouted the same name—the great Stalin; blessed the same person: Long live Stalin! This is by no means accidental. Because he, the great Stalin, is the initiator, organizer, and leader of the world peace camp. Under the call of the World Peace Congress, this movement to defend peace and oppose the danger of new war is surging in every corner of the world. Various countries are holding peace conferences and organizing peace committees. The World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the International Union of Students are all stepping up the mobilization of workers, women, youth, and students around the world to fight for lasting world peace.

　　IV. Stalin's Banner is a Guarantee of the Victory of Lasting World Peace

　　Stalin represents the true strength of all mankind and has unshakable confidence in the cause of lasting world peace. On October 28, 1948, a reporter from Pravda asked Stalin: What might be the result of the reactionary gentlemen's support for aggression and the policy of launching new wars? Stalin replied decisively: "The result can only be the shameful failure of the instigators of new war. Churchill, the main instigator of new war, has already made himself lose the trust of the people of his own country and the democratic forces of the world. The same fate awaits all other war instigators. The people of all countries still have fresh memories of the horrors of the last war. The power of the masses of peace-loving people is so great for Churchill's disciples who are carrying out aggression that they cannot overcome this power and cannot turn this power to new wars."

　　History will prove in the near future that Stalin's brilliant prediction is completely correct. The people of the world have gone through two world wars and resolutely oppose a new third world war. This is beyond doubt. Now, the strength of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union has far surpassed that of the imperialist aggression camp headed by the United States. The brilliant success of the Soviet Union's post-war new five-year plan and the soaring growth of its international prestige, the increasing strength of the new democratic countries, and the increasing awakening and unity of all peace-loving forces in the world all show that the world peace and democracy camp is becoming stronger. Among them, what is particularly important is that, first, the great victory of our Chinese people has greatly changed the balance of power between the two major camps in the world. It has basically broken the bloody and sinful hands of the imperialists in the Pacific and in Asia, on which they rely to launch new wars. As one of Stalin's closest comrades-in-arms, Malenkov, said: "The victory of Chinese democracy not only opened a new chapter in the history of the Chinese people, but also opened a new chapter in the history of the Asian people who are oppressed by U.S. imperialism." He also said: "The victory of Chinese democracy means that the position of the world democratic and anti-imperialist camp, which is fighting for lasting peace, has been greatly strengthened." Second, it is the establishment of the German Democratic Republic. Stalin said this when celebrating the establishment of democratic Germany: "The establishment of the peace-loving democratic republic of Germany is a turning point in European history. There is no doubt that the side-by-side existence of peace-loving and democratic Germany and peace-loving Soviet Union makes new war in Europe impossible, ends the bloodshed in Europe, and makes it impossible for world imperialism to enslave European countries."

　　The establishment of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic has opened new historical periods in the East and the West, and has severely hit the new war plans of the imperialist aggressor groups. Stalin's assessment and prediction greatly encouraged all peace-loving and democratic forces in the world, giving them higher confidence and greater courage, while also maintaining higher vigilance, resolutely and bravely advancing.

　　When the people of the world are now enthusiastically celebrating Stalin's 70th birthday and shouting "Long live Stalin," everyone feels extremely proud, because the great Stalin is the creator and commander of our world peace and democracy camp, and is the organizer, encourager, and leader of the peaceful forces of all countries and all nations in the world. In him is embodied the invincible strength of all mankind's pursuit of democracy and lasting peace.

　　All peace-loving people, continue to stride forward under Stalin's glorious banner! Stalin's banner is the banner of victory, and it is the guarantee of the victory of the world's people's democracy and lasting peace.

　　Long live Stalin!
　　Long live lasting democratic peace in the world!

　　斯大林与世界和平
    钱俊瑞
  　一、全世界人民今天的中心任务是争取巩固的持久的和平
    半世纪来，各国人民已经经历了两次全世界规模的大战。在两次大战中，几千万人被打死和打伤了，几万万人被烧掉了房子，挨了饿，受了冻；病死和饿死的人数不清。工厂、作坊和农庄大批大批地被毁坏。除了极少数的资本家和大地主，全世界人在那时都过着一种凄惨可怕的生活。这就是帝国主义侵略者发动了两次世界大战的一方面的结果。这种世界大战是资本主义发展到最高阶段即帝国主义阶段的产物。在帝国主义之前，人类是有过很多次战争的，但那时不会有过，也决不可能有世界大战，因为在那时，没有那一种反动统治能够有象帝国主义时代金融资本那样具有世界范围的统治。在帝国主义时代被结束之后，世界战争固然没有了，就是战争本身也是要消灭的。因为战争是剥削制度的产物，取帝国主义时代而代之的社会主义时代，就会消灭剥削制度，就会消灭那个引起战争的根源，因此，在那时就不可能再发生战争了。
    自古以来，各国人民大众总是爱好和平的。但是，直到一百年前马克思主义诞生了，方才找到了真正消灭战争的道路，那就是：由无产阶级来领导，团结广大的劳动人民，组织革命斗争，来推翻反动阶级的压迫和剥削的制度，挖掉发动战争的根子。马克思和恩格斯，列宁和斯大林，他们都是反对战争和组织真正和平的伟大战士和领导者。
    在第一次世界大战之前和大战之中，列宁和斯大林最坚决地反对这种帝国主义战争，并且号召、领导和组织各国国内的革命斗争来反对它。这一斗争首先在世界六分之一的土地上成功了，俄国地主资产阶级继续帝国主义战争的政策，被十月社会主义革命打断了，这样就出现了人类历史上第一个社会主义国家苏联。
    在第二次世界大战之前和大战之中，斯大林最坚决地反对这种由德、意、日法西斯帝国主义所发动的侵略战争，并且号召、领导和组织全世界人民的反法西斯战争，来反对它。结果，法西斯侵略战争失败了，人民的反法西斯战争胜利了，从而为世界的持久和平开辟了一条大路。
    现在，在第二次世界大战结束之后还不久，美英帝国主义集团却又要走威廉第二和希特勒的老路，拼命组织新的战争，妄图再一次用千千万万人的死亡和人类文明的毁灭来威胁全人类。领导这些杀人魔王的头子便是杜鲁门、马歇尔、杜勒斯、邱吉尔和贝文，而站在这批头子后面的真正的主人却是华尔街和伦敦“城”的金融大王们。
    这是今天压在全人类头上的最大的威胁。各国人民大众今天最迫切和最中心的任务就是为反对这种新战争的威胁，保卫和巩固世界和平而奋斗。全世界各国人民只有在这一伟大斗争中胜利了，才能确保各个国民族独立自由的生活，才能进行创造物质与精神幸福的建设，才能有以完全平等互助为基础的各民族间的友好合作，也才能逐步地走向全人类所想望的世界大同。
    二、斯大林的政策就是和平政策
    斯大林，这位马克思、恩格斯和列宁的最好的继承者，他的全部学说和行动是为了满足全人类的最大和最长远的利益。已经去世了的季米特洛夫曾经说过：“如同工人阶级是国际的一样，斯大林也是国际的；如同布尔塞维克主义是国际的一样，斯大林也是国际的；如同马列主义是国际的一样，斯大林也是国际的；马列主义的学说，是对世界全体被剥削者和被压迫者指出了解放的道路，斯大林的理论和实践，包括了一切国家、各种民族、各种人种的工人的利益”。（斯大林与国际无产阶级）
    在列宁和斯大林领导下，而在列宁死后，就在斯大林领导下，建设起来的苏联，是反对帝国主义的强大堡垒，是世界和平的强大堡垒。斯大林继承和发展了马克思列宁主义，领导苏联人民在和平的环境中建设社会主义，使苏联人民过自由幸福的生活，使全世界人民，有一个强大的靠山，有一个强大的根据地，以便利于他们进行自己的斗争，改变自己国家的社会制度，挖掉发动战争的根子。这是一方面。
    另一方面，社会主义的苏联，在其开国之初，就宣布了自己的和平政策。一九一七年十一月苏维埃国家的第一个行动，就是宣布关于缔结公正与民主的和平的和平法令。在斯大林的领导下，苏联始终一贯地奉行这个和平政策，不屈不挠地以最大的决心和力量反对一切破坏和平的企图和行为，坚决地保卫世界和平的事业。苏联的这种和平政策是以苏联的社会主义制度和苏联人民的利益为基础的。社会主义的社会既然已经废止了人剥削人、人压迫人的制度，创造了各个不同的民族和不同的种族之间兄弟般的友好和合作，因此，它决不需要剥削和压迫别的国家和别的民族，决不需要向外扩张，也决不需要掠夺殖民地。正因为社会主义的社会制度已经消灭了失业和经济危机的根源（生产的社会性与资本主义私有制的对立），因而社会主义的苏联决不会和帝国主义的国家一样，需要用发动战争的办法来逃避什么经济危机。这就是为什么苏联人民如此一贯地坚决反对战争和保卫和平的道理。
    斯大林的和平政策不仅适合于苏联人民的利益，而且也适合于一切爱好和平的国家的利益，适合于全人类的利益。这种和平政策表现于苏联的对外政策上，就是用全力来争取国际的和平合作，并保障各国的安全。斯大林就是苏联这个和平对外政策的制订者。一九一七年十一月八日的第二次苏维埃代表大会通过了和平法令，向一切国家的工人阶级和人民大众呼吁：“把和平事业以及使被压迫的劳动群众摆脱一切奴役和一切剥削的事业顺利进行到底。”一九三一年日本帝国主义进攻我们东北，苏联首先反对这种侵略战争，发动各国制裁日本。一九三四年苏联参加了当时的国际联盟，斯大林对于这件事曾这样分析道：“国际联盟虽然软弱，但总还可以作为揭露侵略者的讲台，作为一种虽然软弱、但总还可以阻碍战争蔓延的和平工具。”一九三九年三月，斯大林对和平政策作了进一步的说明，他说：“我们维护和平，主张加强我国与世界各国之间的商务关系，只要这些国家也对苏联维持同样的关系，而不企图侵犯我国利益的时候，我们是始终保持这个立场的。”当时，各帝国主义疯狂地实行军备竞赛，日本和意大利帝国主义已经发动了侵略中国和侵略阿比西尼亚的战争，英法绥靖主义者则拼命地组织反对苏联的战争。就在这种极端困难的情况下，忠于和平事业的苏联，还坚决地和许多国家订立互不侵犯协定和互助公约（如一九三五年的法苏互助公约和苏捷互助公约；一九三六年的苏蒙互助公约；一九三七年的中苏互不侵犯协定）；甚至在法西斯德国和日本快要发动对苏的进攻的前夜，苏联还和它们签订互不侵犯和中立公约，来阻止和延缓它们的侵略战争。正如斯大林所说：“在这种经济大变动和军事政治大灾难的惊涛骇浪中间，苏联还是屹然不动，继续进行其社会主义建设的事业和维护和平的斗争。”大家都知道，苏联当年的这种斗争是有很大的收获的。它们教育了苏联和全世界的广大人民，让他们逐渐地认识法西斯侵略者的凶恶面目，这对第二次大战中全世界反法西斯统一战线的形成和发展有极大的帮助。
    三、斯大林是世界和平阵营的创造者和领袖
    在第二次世界大战中，以苏联为首的反法西斯统一战线打败了法西斯的德国、日本和意大利。全世界一切爱好自由和平的人民都曾直接地和间接地参加了那次神圣的伟大的反法西斯战争。他们为什么积极地参加这个正义的反法西斯战争呢？他们参加的目的，正象斯大林在一九四一年十一月六日所宣称的，就在于：“消灭种族的歧视；各民族平等及其领土的不可侵犯；解放一切被奴役的民族并恢复其主权；各民族得按照其自己的愿望过他们的生活；给被压迫的民族以经济援助，并实际地帮助他们获得物质幸福；恢复自由”。
    斯大林在反法西斯战争进行得最艰难的时候所发表的这个作战纲领，就成了第二次大战后各国人民和平奋斗的纲领，就成了几年以来以及今后动员和组织一切爱好和平民主的力量，争取持久和平的行动纲领。这个纲领曾经具体地表现在斯大林本人签过字的雅尔达协定上面。这个协定庄严地写着：“惟有我们三个国家之间继续和发展共同合作与相互了解，人类的最高愿望——坚固而永久的和平，才能实现。”根据了同样的精神，苏联和英美还签订了德黑兰协定和波茨坦协定。在斯大林的和平政策领导下，苏联信守不渝地实行了这些协定，并根据这些协定，要求及早地签订对德和约和对日和约。在斯大林的和平政策领导下，苏联最积极地参加了联合国的工作，揭露和反击了各种来自帝国主义集团的破坏联合国根基的一切阴谋，并在历次的联合国大会和外长会议上，尽力揭穿新战争挑拨者的各种诡计，反对新战争的宣传，反对作为组织新战争的工具的北大西洋公约。在斯大林的和平政策领导下，苏联从一九四六年以来曾向联合国大会提出了许多保卫和平的有效步骤，如普遍裁减军备和武装部队的议案，禁止原子武器的议案，谴责战争宣传的议案，裁减五大国武装部队和军备三分之一的议案，以及今年九月间所提出的由美、英、中、法、苏五强签订加强和平公约的议案等等。斯大林还亲自在他给史密斯的信里提议缔结苏美和平公约。
    全世界各国的人民就在斯大林的和平政策的感召之下，为了反对新战争的严重威胁，已经逐渐地动员和组织起来。斯大林曾经在回答合众社记者艾吉·基莫尔所提问题的时候，说道：“我深深相信，无论那个民族和他们的军队，都不愿意再有新的战争。他们希望和平，并愿为和平而努力。为了保持和平和全世界的安宁，必须及时揭露新战争的煽动者，不让他们有可能妄用自己的力量去反对和平的利益。”斯大林的这种坚定不移的信心和符合于各国人民的真实愿望和号召，鼓舞和推动了全世界一切爱好和平的力量，自觉地团结起来，反对新战争的危险，保卫世界的和平。
    一九四九年四月全世界五十七国的代表，代表了世界十二个国际性的团体和五百六十一个全国性的团体，代表了全世界六万万以上有组织的工人、农民、知识分子和其他爱好和平的人们，在巴黎和布拉格，开了一个世界和平拥护者大会。在这个大会上，几千个代表用各种不同的语言，呼喊着同一个名字——伟大的斯大林；祝福着同一个人：斯大林万岁！这决不是偶然的。因为他，伟大的斯大林，乃是全世界和平阵营的倡导者，组织者和领袖。在世界和平大会的号召下，这个保卫和平，反对新战争危险的运动，正在世界各个角落汹涌澎湃地开展着。各国都开着保卫和平大会，组织保卫和平委员会。世界工联，世界民主妇联，世界民主青联，世界学联，都在加紧地动员全世界的工人、妇女、青年、学生，为着争取世界的持久和平而斗争。
    四、斯大林的旗帜是世界持久和平胜利的保证
    斯大林代表着全人类的真实力量，对世界持久和平的事业，具有不可动摇的胜利的信心。一九四八年十月二十八日，真理报记者曾经问斯大林：那些反动的绅士们支持侵略，支持发动新战争的政策，“这一切的结果可能是什么呢”？斯大林斩钉截铁地回答道：“其结果只能是新战争鼓动者的可耻的失败。邱吉尔这个新战争的主要鼓动者，业已做到了使自己丧失其本国人民和全世界民主力量对他的信任。同一命运等待着其他的一切战争鼓动者。上次战争的惨象，各国人民的记忆犹新。主张和平的人民大众的力量，对进行侵略的邱吉尔门徒们来说，是如此的强大，他们战胜不了这种力量，不能将这种力量转向新的战争去。”
    历史将要在不久的将来证实斯大林的英明预见是完全正确的。全世界人民经过了两次世界大战，坚决地反对新的第三次大战，这是毫无疑义的。现在以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的力量已经远远地超过了以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营。苏联战后新五年计划的辉煌成功，及其国际威信的飞跃增长，各新民主国家的日益强盛，全世界一切爱好和平力量的日益觉醒和团结，这一切都说明了世界和平民主阵营正在更加强大起来。其中特别重要的，第一、就是我们中国人民的伟大胜利，它大大地改变了世界两大阵营力量的对比，它在太平洋，在亚洲，基本上打断了帝国主义者所赖以发动新战争的一双血淋淋的罪恶的手。正如斯大林的最亲密的战友之一马林科夫所说：“中国民主的胜利，不仅揭开了中国人民历史的新的一章，并且揭开了受美帝国主义压迫的亚洲各国人民历史的新的一章。”他又说：“中国民主的胜利，意味着正在为持久和平而斗争的世界民主反帝阵营的地位大大地加强了。”第二、就是德意志民主共和国的成立。斯大林在庆祝民主德国的成立时，曾这样说：“德意志民主的爱好和平的共和国的成立，是欧洲历史的转折点。无可怀疑，爱好和平的民主的德国与爱好和平的苏联之并肩存在，使得欧洲不再有新战争的可能，结束欧洲的流血，并使世界帝国主义奴役欧洲国家成为不可能。”
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的成立，在东方和西方都开辟了新的历史时期，都严重地打击了帝国主义侵略集团的新战争计划。斯大林的估计和预见大大地鼓舞了全世界一切爱好和平民主的力量，使他们具有更高的信心和更大的勇气，同时也抱着更高的警惕，坚决和奋勇地前进。
    当全世界人民现在热狂地庆祝斯大林的七十寿辰，高呼“斯大林万岁”的时候，大家都感到万分的骄傲，因为，伟大的斯大林就是我们世界和平民主阵营的创造者和司令员，是全世界一切国家一切民族的和平力量的组织者、鼓舞者和领导者。在他身上体现着全人类的追求民主与持久和平的无敌的力量。
    一切爱好和平的人们，继续在斯大林的光辉旗帜下大踏步前进吧。斯大林的旗帜，就是胜利的旗帜，就是世界人民民主与持久和平胜利的保证。
    斯大林万岁！
    世界持久的民主的和平万岁！
