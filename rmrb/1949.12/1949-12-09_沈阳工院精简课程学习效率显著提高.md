　　【Northeast News】Shenyang Institute of Technology has appropriately reduced the amount of coursework, improved extracurricular activities and teaching methods to enhance students' learning efficiency. This work has achieved initial results.

　　Since the beginning of this semester more than two months ago, the general feeling among students has been that the courses are too heavy and they are extremely tense and busy. They automatically get up one hour earlier every morning. The stipulated one hour of extracurricular activity time in the afternoon is also spent in the classroom doing exercises. Lights are supposed to go out at 9:30 pm, but in reality, most students do homework until 12:00 am before going to bed, which affects their health. However, most students still have not fully digested the course content, and can only mechanically apply formulas when doing exercises, and they can't keep up with the courses.

　　The main reasons for this situation are that the workload of the courses is too heavy, with each class having a maximum of 41 hours and a minimum of 34 hours of classes per week, while the stipulated self-study time is at most less than 4 hours and at least only 2 hours. Most courses require timely review and exercises. Secondly, there are too many extracurricular activities (including off-campus publicity, participation in various commemorative meetings and other social activities, and various on-campus extracurricular activities), and the on-campus extracurricular activities are not centered on regular course learning. Most of them engage in large dramas and choruses and other recreational activities. Although mutual aid groups have been established, they are not conducting mutual aid learning at all. In addition, there are still shortcomings in teaching methods, such as insufficient preparation, unclear focus, unclear organization, and too fast a pace.

　　In response to the above facts, the institute decided in the middle of this month to appropriately reduce the courses of each class or the class hours of a certain course, canceling or postponing them, and extending the course originally scheduled to be taught in three and a half years to four years. The factory internship originally scheduled for the second semester of the fourth year will be moved to the summer and winter vacations. For example, differential equations in the second grade of the Department of Chemical Engineering is both a remedial course and not very important to the department, so it has been canceled. The organic chemistry of the class has been changed from six hours per week to four hours, and changed from one year to one and a half year course. Mechanics in the second grade of the Department of Civil Engineering has been postponed. In this way, the courses per week for each class are only 29 to 33 hours. Secondly, improve extracurricular activities, such as changing the forms of large dramas and choruses into various forms of small concerts. Extracurricular activities are centered on regular course learning, and efforts are concentrated on improving mutual aid groups. Regarding teaching, the Department of Chemical Engineering and the Mathematics and Physics Teaching Group are the key points. Professors teaching the same and similar courses are organized to listen to and discuss each other's classes. On the one hand, they study how to improve the course content under the principle of adapting to the students' current level and maintaining the due standards and workload. On the other hand, they study how to improve teaching methods.

　　After this improvement, the students at the institute generally feel much more relaxed now. The phenomenon of getting up early and going to bed late has also been basically overcome. In particular, the students in the classes of the Department of Civil Engineering have immediately improved the mutual aid groups after reducing the workload of the courses. After reviewing the day's courses by themselves using the method of taking notes, they use mutual questioning, discussion, and testing methods in the mutual aid group to help each other learn. In this way, the courses and exercises taught that day can be reviewed and solved during the stipulated self-study time.

### 沈阳工院精简课程学习效率显著提高

　　沈阳工院精简课程学习效率显著提高
    【东北讯】沈阳工学院适当减轻课程分量，改进课外活动及教学方法，以增进学生的学习效率，这一工作已收初步效果。
    该院自本期开学两个多月以来，一般同学均感课程过于繁重而极度紧张忙碌，每天早上自动提前一小时起床，午后规定的一小时课外活动时间也留在教室里演算习题，晚上规定九时半熄灯，实际上大部同学均作业到十二时始就寝，影响了健康。但多数同学仍对课程内容未全部消化，演算习题便只能硬套公式，而且课程也只始终追赶不上。
    形成这种情况的原因，主要由于课程的分量过重，各班每礼拜的课程最多四十一小时，最小三十四小时，而规定的自习时间最多不到四小时，最少的仅两小时，大部课程又须及时复习与演算习题；其次则由于课外活动（包括校外宣传、参加各种纪念会等社会活动与校内各种课外活动）太多，而校内课外活动又没以正课学习为中心，大多搞大剧大合唱等文娱活动，互助小组虽然成立，但完全没有进行互助学习。此外在教学方法上还存在准备不够充分、中心不够明确、条理不够清楚、进度太快等缺点。
    针对以上事实，该院于本月中旬决定适当减少各班的课程或某课程的授课钟点，分别予以取消或缓开，并将原定三年半教完的课程延长为四年教完，原定第四年下期的工厂实习则移于暑假与寒假。如化工系二年级的微分方程既为补习课程，对本系又不甚重要，因此取消，该班的有机化学则由每礼拜六时改为四时，并改一年为一年半课程。土木系二年级的机动学则缓开。这样一来，各班每礼拜的课程则仅二十九到三十三小时了。其次改进课外活动，如把大剧、大合唱等形式改为各种形式的小演唱。课外活动以正课学习为中心，并集中力量健全互助小组。关于教学方面，则以化工系及数理教学小组为重点，组织教相同与相似课程的教授互相听课与讨论，一方面研究在适合学生现有程度及保持应有的标准及分量的原则下，改进课程内容，另一方面则研究如何改进教学方法。
    该院经过这一番改进后，现在一般同学均感觉轻松多了。早起晚睡的现象也基本克服。特别是土木系各班同学由于减轻了课程分量后，又立即健全了互助小组，每天自己用记大纲的方式把当天的课程复习完后，又在互助小组中利用相互问答、讨论、测验等方式互助学习，这样就在规定的自习时间中把当天所讲的课程与习题复习与演算完毕。
