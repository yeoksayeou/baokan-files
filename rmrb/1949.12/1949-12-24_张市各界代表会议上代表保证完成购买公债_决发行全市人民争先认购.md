[Our Newspaper] Yesterday at 10 a.m., Zhang City held its Second Session, Third People's Representative Conference, celebrating the anniversary of Zhang City's re-liberation and listening to Mayor Sun Jingwen's summary report on municipal work. More than ten representatives spoke enthusiastically at the meeting. They all expressed satisfaction with the Zhang City government's work over the past year and unanimously expressed their support for the Central People's Government's issuance of Victory Parity Bonds. Communist Party representative Li Rui (from the Third District Party Committee) said: "We unanimously support the Central People's Government's issuance of People's Victory Parity Bonds. Parity bonds are equivalent to long-term savings, and our Party members must take the lead in buying them." Worker representative Mao Lewen said: "In the future, the working class must exert even greater strength and creativity, continue to carry out the savings movement, accumulate wealth, and expand reproduction. We are very supportive of the central government's issuance of bonds and will work hard to mobilize the masses to subscribe." A women's representative said: "Last year today, my man was arrested. I was still wearing a lined jacket. I fainted from sadness and hunger. At that time, I had no food and worked for others, and people laughed at me. Since liberation, I have become a cadre and participated in production. Not only does no one laugh at me, but they also say I am a good cadre. I will spin more yarn to buy bonds." Mr. Li Shaofang, a representative of the business community, said: "Zhang City's industry and commerce suffered greatly under the Kuomintang rule. Since liberation, industry and commerce have gradually developed, especially myself! If the People's Liberation Army had not come, I would never have gotten out of prison. We unanimously support the bonds and will strive to buy them first." Representatives from farmers, youth, Hui people, and others spoke successively, unanimously agreeing that municipal work had achieved considerable success and unanimously supporting the issuance of bonds, guaranteeing purchases. The meeting unanimously passed a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, expressing that the people of the city were ready to enthusiastically purchase bonds; and a telegram to Marshal Stalin congratulating him on his seventieth birthday. It was also decided to launch in-depth propaganda to mobilize all citizens to purchase bonds.
