[Beijing News] The first Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and Government Committee members of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, elected by the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference and appointed with the approval of the Central People's Government, held their inauguration ceremony at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 9th). In addition to over a thousand cadres from various units of the Municipal Government, the ceremony was attended by all members of the Consultative Committee of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, as well as over fifty representatives from various parties, organizations, and sectors. The ceremony began with the solemn and majestic national anthem. First, Mayor Nie Rongzhen delivered a speech. He proposed that the basic work guidelines and tasks of the Municipal Government are: to establish and consolidate revolutionary order, to restore and develop production, to carry out people's cultural and educational undertakings, to carry out various municipal construction projects, to convene the People's Representative Conference, and to implement the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference. Mayor Nie particularly emphasized that to accomplish this task, it is necessary to sincerely listen to the people's opinions and wholeheartedly serve the people; to resolutely oppose bureaucracy and diligently act as the city's cleaners and servants for all the people. Regarding which government tasks are important and which are minor, he said: "Whatever matters only concern us personally are minor matters; whatever concerns the interests of the people are major matters and must be done well." He encouraged the new and old cadres of the Municipal Government to learn from each other, unite with each other, and continue to work hard and improve themselves. Mayor Nie solemnly announced, "We have the confidence to complete the tasks entrusted to us by the two million people of the capital and the Central People's Government!" Deputy Mayor Wu Han then spoke. He heard on the radio while returning from Moscow that he had been elected as the Deputy Mayor of the capital. In a brief speech, he declared that under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Mayor Nie, and under the supervision of the people of the city, he had the confidence to fulfill the important task entrusted to him by the people of Beijing. After Committee Members Weng Dujian and Liang Sicheng delivered speeches, guests successively delivered speeches. The first to be invited to speak was Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Consultative Committee of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference. He first pointed out that today's inauguration ceremony for the first popularly elected Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and Government Committee members of Beijing marks a new stage in the construction of the people's democratic power in Beijing. He then explained that although the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government in the past were not popularly elected, they were democratic because they represented the will of the people and wholeheartedly served the people. He went on to explain that the tasks of the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the people are now arduous. It must eliminate feudal remnants in all aspects, restore and develop production, and engage in economic, political, cultural, and municipal construction. To accomplish such arduous tasks, it is necessary to closely connect with the masses, especially the working people, and constantly improve one's work through criticism and self-criticism. Finally, Comrade Peng Zhen spoke about the new and old cadres, saying: "Regardless of new or old cadres, we have only one standard: whoever can do the work well under the leadership of the Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and Government Committee members, and in accordance with the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference, is a good cadre. We should use this as a standard to measure our cadres." Following this, Yu Xinqing, representative of the Beijing Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Guan Shixiong, representative of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League, Han Zhao'e, representative of the Beijing Organizing Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Ling Qijun, representative of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, Xiao Ming, representative of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, Qin Qifang, representative of the Beijing Women's Federation, Xu Liqun, representative of the Beijing Working Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, and Gu Qizong, representative of the Beijing Students' Federation, successively delivered speeches, unanimously expressing their heartfelt support for the government they had elected and expressing their willingness to jointly complete various construction tasks under the leadership of the government. After the speeches were completed, the ceremony was declared complete amidst harmonious music.
