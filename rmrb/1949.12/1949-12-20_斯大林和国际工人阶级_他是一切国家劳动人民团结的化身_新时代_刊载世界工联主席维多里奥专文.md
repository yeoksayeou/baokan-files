Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 19th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The latest issue of the New Era magazine published a special article by Vittorio, President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, entitled "Stalin and the International Working Class."

　　The article stated in brief: On December 21, 1949, the working people of the entire world will celebrate the seventieth birthday of their leader, Stalin. On that day, in factories and buildings, in offices and fields of every country, words of emotion, admiration, respect, and gratitude will be spoken to Stalin. Regardless of nationality, race, or religion, workers, peasants, and intellectuals all over the world send out heartfelt cries.

　　Vittorio emphasized: The appeal of Stalin's name transcends all national and ethnic boundaries; its power is also immense in countries still under capitalist rule. Stalin is the embodiment of the unity of the working people of all countries. Stalin's worldwide prestige is a powerful factor in the civilization and progress of human society, which is victoriously resisting the imperialist barbarians. The love for Stalin reflects the growing and maturing political consciousness of the international working class, who hail Stalin as their recognized leader, beloved teacher, and the genius guiding them. The author further wrote: Stalin enjoys extraordinarily great prestige throughout the world because he has unreservedly dedicated his life and talent to the working class. Stalin's immense prestige stems from his extraordinary intellectual power, his outstanding qualities as a thinker and scientist, political and military strategist, and the organizer of the working class's greatest victory in the entire history of mankind.

　　Every country's workers know that the existence of the Soviet state created by Lenin and Stalin has weakened the entire imperialist camp and strengthened the camp of those striving to break free from the capitalist yoke. They know that every victory of the Soviet Union in the cause of building a socialist society is also a victory for the working class and oppressed people elsewhere. There are many reasons for the worldwide workers' love and admiration for Stalin, among which the Soviet Constitution, which the working people everywhere call the Stalin Constitution, should be particularly mentioned. Never in the world has a constitution or any other official document of any country been as embraced as the Soviet Constitution. The propaganda organs of monopoly capital's attempts to prevent the people of capitalist countries from increasingly supporting Stalin have all failed miserably. The situation in Italy is the same. Here, twenty years of fascist propaganda has particularly focused on achieving this goal. But the Italian people's respect and love for Stalin continue to grow. For the people, Stalin's name is a symbol of justice and a guarantee that this justice will sooner or later triumph in Italy.

　　Stalin is not only the leader and teacher of the international working class, but also their role model. His own glorious history provides a brilliant example, educating the staunch and unyielding revolutionary ranks of the working class in all countries, and educating millions of loyal soldiers dedicated to the cause of the working class and capable of accomplishing heroic deeds. Warriors striving for a better future for mankind can produce Stalinist leaders by diligently studying all aspects of Stalin.

　　Stalin's unwavering spirit in defending peace inspires peace fighters in all countries. The forces for peace are greater than the forces for war. Peace will surely triumph. And on this point, the people of all countries should first of all thank the great Soviet Union under the leadership of Stalin for its decisive contribution to peace every day.

　　Letters and telegrams expressing congratulations and love are pouring into Moscow from all countries and every corner, all saying: "Long live Joseph Stalin!"

　　斯大林和国际工人阶级
    ——他是一切国家劳动人民团结的化身
    “新时代”刊载世界工联主席维多里奥专文
    【新华社北京十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近一期新时代杂志刊载世界工会联合会主席维多里奥的专文，题为“斯大林和国际工人阶级”。
    该文略称：在一九四九年十二月二十一日，全世界的劳动人民均将庆祝他们的领袖——斯大林的七十寿辰。到那一天，在每个国家的工厂和建筑物、在办公室和田野里，都要向斯大林说出感动、钦佩、敬爱和感激的言词。不分国籍、种族或宗教，全世界的工人、农民和知识分子都发出了出乎真情的呼声。
    维多里奥强调称：斯大林的名字的吸引力，超越了一切国家和民族间的界限；它的力量在仍然受资本主义统治的国家里，也是很巨大的。斯大林是一切国家劳动人民团结的化身。斯大林的遍及全世界的声望，是人类社会的文明和进步的有力因素，这个社会正在胜利地抗击着帝国主义野蛮人。对斯大林的热爱，反映了国际工人阶级政治觉悟的日益增长和成熟，他们祝斯大林为他们公认的领袖，敬爱的导师和指导他们的天才。　作者进一步写道：斯大林在全世界享有的异常巨大的声望，是因为他毫无保留地将他的生命和天才贡献给工人阶级。斯大林的巨大声望，是由他的异常的智慧力量，他的作为思想家和科学家、政治和军事战略家、整个人类历史当中工人阶级最伟大胜利的组织者的杰出品质而产生的。
    每个国家的工人都知道，列宁与斯大林所创造的苏维埃国家的存在，削弱了整个帝国主义阵营，加强了争取解脱资本主义枷锁者的阵营。他们知道，苏联在建设社会主义社会事业中的每一胜利，同时就是其他地方工人阶级与被压迫人民的胜利。全世界工人对斯大林的热爱和敬仰，原因是很多的，其中特别应该提到苏联宪法，一切地方的劳动人民都把它叫做斯大林宪法。全世界千百万工人知道、并且记得斯大林宪法的主要原则。世界上从来没有一个宪法或任何国家的任何其他官方文件，象苏联宪法这样受到拥护。独占资本宣传机关制止资本主义国家人民日益拥戴斯大林的一切企图，均归惨败。意大利的情形也是如此。在这里，二十年来的法西斯宣传，特别着力于达到这个目的。但意大利人民对斯大林的尊敬和热爱却不断增长。对人民来说，斯大林的名字，乃是正义的象征，也是这种正义迟早将在意大利取得胜利的保证。
    斯大林不仅是国际工人阶级的领袖和导师，他还是他们的榜样。他本人的辉煌历史，提供了光辉范例，教育了各国工人阶级中坚强不屈的革命队伍，教育了千百万致力于工人阶级事业并能完成英雄业迹的忠诚战士。争取人类美好前途的战士们，努力学习斯大林的各个方面，这样就能产生斯大林式的领袖。
    斯大林在保卫和平中间的坚强不移的精神，鼓舞了一切国家的和平战士。拥护和平的力量比战争力量为大。和平必能胜利。而在这点上，各国人民首先应感谢斯大林领导下的伟大苏联每天对于和平的决定性贡献。
    表示祝贺和爱戴的函电，从一切国家和每个角落纷纷送到莫斯科，都说：“约瑟夫·斯大林光荣万岁！”
