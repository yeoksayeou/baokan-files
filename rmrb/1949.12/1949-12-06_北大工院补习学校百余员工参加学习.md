　　Over a Hundred Employees of Peking University Institute of Engineering Remedial School Participate in Learning

　　[Our dispatch] The employee remedial school of Peking University Institute of Engineering began on November 7th. A total of 103 employees participated in the learning. This includes 40 people in the literacy class, 52 people in the elementary class (learning some deeper words and sentences), and 11 people in the advanced class (roughly equivalent to the first and second years of junior high school).

　　Classes have been underway for over 20 days now, and not a single person has been absent or late for any class. Old worker Lao Gao, who is older, is in the classroom with his textbook waiting a dozen or so minutes before class. He said, "When I was young, I couldn't afford to study because my family was poor, and I was blind for half my life. Now that the Communist Party has come, helping us learn, I can't be careless." Old worker Lao Li is also working very hard under the stage, using scraps of paper to make an exercise book and writing characters every day, and he now recognizes more than 100 characters. Because the workers' enthusiasm for learning is high, each literacy class will change from a dozen or so new characters to about 20. Shi Zhengyin, the staff member in charge of academic affairs, said, "I am doing the academic affairs work as a side job, but I am not afraid of being tired, and I hope to study this aspect in detail so that the workers' learning is more secure."

　　In addition to the increase in knowledge, the workers' political level has also improved. Worker Lao Xing said, "In the past, I only knew that workers were servants, but now I understand that workers are the real masters." With the improvement of their political level, their work has also become more active. The rice dumplings of the Institute of Engineering were exchanged for cornmeal with the millet issued, which was subject to double exploitation. The students and technicians negotiated and hoped to install the old electric mill of the school. Master Li said, "No problem." After studying in the evening, four of them worked overtime to install a machine, saving the school 1,800 jin of millet.

　　北大工院补习学校百余员工参加学习
    【本报讯】北大工学院员工补习学校于十一月七日开学，参加学习的员工共一百零三人。计识字班四十人，初级班（学一些较深的字句）五十二人，高级班（和初中一二差不多）十一人。
    现在开课已经二十多天，每一堂都没有一个人旷课和迟到，年老的工友老高在上课以前十几分钟便在教室里拿着课本等着。他说：“年青的时候因为家里穷念不起书，当了半辈子瞎子。现在共产党来了，帮助我们学习，我怎么也不能马马虎虎了。”工友老李在堂下也很用功，拿碎纸订了个练习簿天天写字，现在已经认识了一百多字。由于工友们的学习情绪高涨，每堂识字班将由十几个生字改为二十个左右，负责教务的职员石正殷说：“教务工作我是兼差，但我不怕累，并且希望对这一方面详加研究，使工友们学习更有保障。”
    除了知识的增进外，工友的政治水准也提高了。工友老刑说：“过去我就知道工友是待候人的，现在才明白工友是真正的主人。”随着政治水平的提高，工作也更积极起来。工学院的饭团用发下来的小米换棒子面要受到双重的剥削，同学们和技工商议希望把学校的旧电磨按起来，李师傅说：“没有问题。”晚上学习后他们四个人加夜班按好了一部机器，节省了学校经费一千八百斤小米。
