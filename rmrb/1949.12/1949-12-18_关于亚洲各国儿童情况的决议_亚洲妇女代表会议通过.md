Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th. The Asian Women's Representative Conference passed the following full text of the resolution on the situation of children in Asian countries on the 16th:

　　The Asian Women's Representative Conference, having listened to the report on the protection of children's rights and the speeches of representatives from various countries on this issue, is proud of the happy lives of children in the Soviet Central Asian Republics, is infinitely excited by the achievements and efforts of the People's Republics of China, Mongolia, Korea, and Vietnam in improving the lives of children, and expresses indignation at the miserable situation of exploitation and inhumane treatment suffered by children in colonial and dependent countries.

　　The Representative Conference points out that the exploitation and suffering of children in Asian colonial and dependent countries are the result of imperialism's enslavement of the people of these countries. In these countries, the imperialists and their running dogs massively exploit the cheap labor of child laborers, sacrificing the lives of tens of thousands of child laborers to accumulate their huge profits. Due to working in inhumane conditions, lacking legal protection, malnutrition, and lack of sanitation, the child mortality rate is shockingly high. Under the rule of imperialism and reactionary governments, the lives of the people are reduced to mere survival, and children become the easiest victims of chronic and infectious diseases, and are bought and sold or become child prostitutes. The imperialist wars of aggression and the instigation of ethnic hatred further deepen this suffering. Schools for the children of working people are almost non-existent. Furthermore, the colonizers instill distorted education such as slavish ideas and racial superiority doctrines into the few students who are able to attend school, spread war ideology, turning children into tame slaves serving imperialism, and develop abnormal psychology in children through low-taste movies and books, leading to undesirable tendencies of child murder and crime. The imperialists and reactionaries who rule these countries imprison and torture children who struggle for survival and their own rights, and even kill them. The existence of slave child laborers and child prostitutes, the deaths of large numbers of children, and the inhumane lives they lead in India, Pakistan, Burma, Indonesia, Malaya, Japan, the Philippines, Ceylon, Thailand, Iran, and the Middle East and Near East countries are powerful evidence that the colonial system has brought disease, hunger, disaster, and death to children. This is why the women of these countries are using all their strength to fight against imperialist rule to end these intolerable crimes against children.

　　The Representative Conference notes the Soviet Union's concern and protection for children's welfare in the Central Asian Republics, and believes that this is the best fact and example showing how happy and beautiful life a socialist society can bring to children. In these republics, the state has created all the conditions for cultivating a healthy younger generation, implemented various measures to protect children, and guaranteed children's right to enjoy free education. Since the establishment of the Soviets, thousands of schools, libraries, children's theaters, children's welfare stations, milk factories, nurseries, kindergartens, and sanatoriums have been established. Education in these republics is based on the high principles of Soviet patriotism, humanism, and respect for other nationalities. Soviet families, facing the pleasant prospect of a constantly improving standard of living, are helping the state to cultivate children, making them creators and builders of a free country.

　　In the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Mongolia, the People's Republic of Korea, and the liberated areas of Vietnam, as a result of the victorious armed struggles that overthrew imperialism and established genuine democratic regimes, efforts are being made in these countries to create a prerequisite for children to obtain a happy life. Laws protecting the interests of children have been formulated, and various measures have been taken to improve the living conditions of children. The number of schools has increased compared to the past, giving the children of working people the opportunity to be educated under the care of the state. Nurseries and kindergartens have been established and are growing with state support. The children of these countries are enjoying the fruits of victory for the first time after being freed from imperialism and feudalism.

　　The Representative Conference points out that in order for the children of colonial and dependent countries to be as healthy and happy as the children of liberated countries, it is necessary to recognize that the rule of imperialism and its running dogs is the root cause of the miserable lives of children in these countries; only by overthrowing imperialist rule in Asia, achieving national independence, and establishing a people's democratic regime can all the demands for the protection of children's rights be fundamentally realized. Any attempt to solve the children's problem under the current rule of imperialism and its running dog reactionaries is merely an illusion. Therefore, the Representative Conference calls on the mothers and women of Asian colonial and dependent countries to resolutely and bravely unite all the people to strive for the liberation of their nations from imperialist oppression and to establish a people's democratic regime; only in this way can we strive for the future happiness of our children. In order to achieve the victory of national liberation and people's democracy, we women must unite with all the people, actively participate in the national united front, and take various methods to carry out resolute struggles against imperialism and its running dogs in order to achieve our goals. The rising national liberation movements in Asian countries show that the people of Asia, who have long been oppressed by imperialism, have recognized the path they must take and are moving along this path towards victory, so that their children can live in countries where the people hold power and develop into healthy, educated, and happy citizens.

　　The Representative Conference believes that the women of various colonial and dependent countries must carry out continuous struggles to protect the daily and immediate interests of children, even if they encounter many difficulties in carrying out these struggles, in order to unite the masses, gather the strength of the masses, and raise the consciousness of the masses in these struggles. To this end, we must strive to combat the exploitation and oppression of child labor, to ensure that working people obtain wages sufficient to maintain their lives in order to implement effective legislation prohibiting child labor, to protect young workers and improve their working conditions; to strive to increase children's health and education funding in the national budget and reduce military spending; to strive for free primary education, to oppose fascist education, and to strive to use the national language in schools.

　　The Representative Conference points out that the International Democratic Women's Federation is a loyal defender of children's rights, and calls on women of all countries to unite under its banner, to fight for the rights of children through various organizations and methods, and to take June 1st - International Children's Day as a day to mobilize broad masses of women to realize these demands. The Representative Conference condemns the United Nations for failing to fulfill its due obligations to protect children's rights, and supports the World Federation of Democratic Youth's appeal to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to protect children in order to urge it to fulfill its responsibility to protect children.

　　关于亚洲各国儿童情况的决议
  　亚洲妇女代表会议通过
    【新华社北京十七日电】亚洲妇女代表会议十六日通过关于亚洲各国儿童情况的的决议全文如下：
    亚洲妇女代表会议听取了保护儿童权利的报告以及各国代表对这一问题的发言后，对苏联在中亚细亚各共和国儿童的幸福生活感到骄傲，对中国、蒙古、朝鲜以及越南等人民共和国在改善儿童生活上的成就和努力感到无限兴奋，并对殖民地各附属国家的儿童所受剥削和非人待遇的悲惨情况表示愤慨。
    代表会议指出：亚洲殖民地及附属国家儿童所受的剥削和痛苦，是帝国主义奴役这些国家的人民的结果。在这些国家内的帝国主义及其走狗，大规模地榨取着童工的廉价劳动力，牺牲成千成万童工的生命来聚集他们的巨大利润。由于在非人的条件下工作，没有法律的保障，营养不良，缺乏卫生条件，就使得儿童死亡率高到惊人的程度。在帝国主义及反动政府的统治下，人民生活降低到只能苟延残喘的地步，儿童就成为慢性病、传染病的最容易袭击的牺牲者，并被买卖或沦为幼娼。帝国主义对于殖民地的侵略战争及挑拨种族仇恨的结果，更加深了这种痛苦。为劳动人民子女而设立的学校几乎不存在。而殖民者更向少数能够入学的学生灌输奴化思想种族优越学说等畸形的教育。传播战争思想，使儿童变成为帝国主义服务的驯服奴隶。并通过低级趣味的电影和书籍，在儿童中发展不正常的心理，并引起儿童杀人犯罪的不良倾向。统治这些国家的帝国主义者和反动派更监禁折磨为生存、为自身权利而斗争的儿童，甚至加以杀害。印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、印度尼西亚、马来亚、日本、菲律宾、锡兰、泰国、伊朗及中东及近东等国奴隶童工与幼娼的存在，大批儿童的死亡及所过的非人的生活，是殖民制度给儿童带来了疾病、饥饿、灾难、死亡的有力见证。这就是为什么这些国家的妇女正用一切力量来进行斗争，反对帝国主义的统治，来结束这种对儿童所犯的不能容忍的罪恶。
    代表会议注意到苏联在中亚细亚共和国对儿童福利的关心保护，认为这是最好的事实和榜样，说明了社会主义社会能够给儿童带来多么幸福美丽的生活。在这些共和国里，国家为培养健康的年青的一代而创造了一切条件，实施了保卫儿童的各种措施，保证儿童有权享受免费教育。自从苏维埃成立以来，数以千计的学校、图书馆、儿童剧院、儿童福利站、牛奶厂、托儿所、幼稚园及休养所都建立起来了。这些共和国的教育是以苏维埃的爱国主义、人道主义及尊重其他民族的高度原则为基础的。面对着生活水准日益提高的愉快远景的苏维埃家庭，正在帮助着国家培养儿童，使他们成为爱好自由的国家的创造者与建设者。
    在中华人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜人民共和国及越南各解放区里，由于进行了胜利的武装斗争而推翻了帝国主义，建立了真正的民主政权的结果，在这些国家里，正在努力造成一种前提条件，使儿童能获得幸福的生活。制定了保护儿童利益的法律，并采取了各种措施来改善儿童的生活条件。学校数目比以前增加，使得劳动人民的子女有机会在国家的爱护下受到教育。托儿所、保育院建立起来了，并在国家的支持下日益发展。这些国家的儿童在摆脱了帝国主义封建主义后，第一次地享受到胜利的果实。
    代表会议指出：要使殖民地附属国的儿童都能象已解放了的国家的儿童那样的健康幸福，就必须认识到帝国主义及其走狗的统治，是造成这些国家儿童悲惨生活的根本原因；只有打倒帝国主义在亚洲的统治，获得民族的独立与建立人民民主政权，才能从根本上实现保护儿童权利的一切要求。任何企图从现在的帝国主义及其走狗反动派的统治下来解决儿童问题的主张，都只是幻想。因此，代表会议号召亚洲各殖民地及附属国的母亲与妇女们，坚决勇敢地团结全体人民，争取自己的民族从帝国主义压迫下解放出来，并建立人民民主政权；只有这样，才能为自己的孩子争取未来的幸福。而要取得民族解放与人民民主的胜利，我们妇女就必须和全体人民团结团结起来，积极参加民族统一战线，采取各种方法，向帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决的斗争，才能达到目的。现在亚洲各国的高涨的民族解放运动，显示了亚洲长期在帝国主义压迫的人民已认清了自己所要走的道路，而且正沿着这道路走向胜利，以便使自己的孩子能在人民掌握了政权的国家内生活着，发展成为健康的、有教养的、快乐的公民。
    代表会议认为各殖民地和附属国的妇女们必须为保护儿童的日常切身利益而进行不断的斗争，即使在进行这种斗争中会遇到许多困难，以便在这些斗争中去团结群众，聚积群众的力量，提高群众觉悟。为此，我们必须为反对对童工的剥削压榨，为保证劳动人民获得足够维持生活的工资以便实现禁止童工的有效立法，为保护青工及改善其劳动条件而努力斗争；争取在国家预算中增加儿童健康和教育经费，削减军事预算；争取免费初级教育，反对法西斯教育，并争取在学校中采用本国语言。
    代表会议指出，国际民主妇女联合会是儿童权利的忠实保卫者，号召各国的妇女团结在它的旗帜下，通过各种组织与方式，去为儿童的权利而斗争，并把六月一日——国际儿童日作为动员广大妇女来实现这些要求的日子。代表会议谴责联合国没有尽到它对保卫儿童权利应有的义务，并支持世界民主青年联盟对联合国人权委员会发出保卫儿童的呼吁，以督促其负起保卫儿童的责任。
