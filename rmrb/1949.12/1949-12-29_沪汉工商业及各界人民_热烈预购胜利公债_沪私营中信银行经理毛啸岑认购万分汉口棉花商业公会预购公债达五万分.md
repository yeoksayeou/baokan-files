　　[This newspaper's Shanghai dispatch on the 28th] The movement of pre-purchasing People's Victory Parity Bonds by workers, teachers and staff of primary and secondary schools, and government cadres in Shanghai continues to expand. Regarding shop assistants: the employees of Zhenda, Lao Jiafu, and Dajing three stores held a temporary year-end bonus consultation meeting between labor and management on the 27th. According to the old practice of last year, an additional month's salary should be issued at the end of the year. Considering the actual situation of the capital side, the employees only hoped that the capital side would issue half a month's salary and decided to purchase public bonds with it. The Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank Labor Union called on everyone to temporarily deposit their bonuses as parity deposits so that they could be converted into public bonds in the future. Many employees subscribed to 100 shares. Youth League member Ji Lu subscribed to 200 shares. Within two days, the number of subscriptions by the bank's employees exceeded 4,000 shares. The bank's labor union also actively promoted purchases to visiting customers. Employees of the Printing Industry Labor Union, the Bureau of Weights and Measures Verification, and China Dyestuff Company also enthusiastically launched subscriptions. Employees in the offices of the Federation of Industry and Commerce have initially subscribed to more than 2,000 shares. After studying the 1950 fiscal revenue and expenditure budget and the report on the issuance of Victory Parity Bonds, the teachers and staff of the No. 1 Central National School in the 11th District immediately launched subscription campaign. They have now jointly subscribed to 450 shares. After several seminars and group discussions, Fan Chunxi, the headmaster of Xiaoguang Middle School, used his half-year salary, except for the necessary pocket money, to purchase public bonds. Although the comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China are all on the supply system, they still expressed their willingness to save all or part of their spring daily necessities allowance for next year to purchase. Comrade Wang Xing, a female comrade, exchanged the gold ring she had kept for public bonds. All 28 staff members of the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have subscribed to 1,000 shares. In addition, in order to successfully complete the promotion of the People's Victory Parity Bonds, the Shanghai Municipal Second Session of People's Representatives Consultative Committee held its first Standing Committee meeting on the 27th, deciding to form a People's Victory Parity Bonds Shanghai Municipal Promotion Committee to lead the city's sales work. The preparatory committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce also held its third plenary preparatory committee meeting on the same day, deciding to establish the Industry and Commerce Branch of the People's Victory Parity Bonds Promotion Committee. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Democratic Youth Federation, and the Student Federation also issued a joint notice yesterday, calling on Shanghai youth to carry out publicity and explanations to people from all walks of life and their relatives and friends, to ensure that everyone speaks up, everyone contributes, saves money, and everyone enthusiastically subscribes to Victory Parity Bonds.
　　[This newspaper's Shanghai dispatch on the 28th] The pre-purchase of public bonds by the industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai has begun. Mao Xiaocen, manager of the Shanghai private Zhongxin Bank, in response to the call of the People's Government and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, took the lead in subscribing to 10,000 shares of public bonds today.
