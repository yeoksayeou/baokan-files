    Section 3: The Class Nature, Party Character, and Internationalism of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy

    The Party character or Party spirit of Marxist-Leninist political economy requires us to criticize all anti-proletarian, anti-communist, and anti-Marxist-Leninist views, as well as various non-proletarian and non-Marxist-Leninist economic theories and propositions. It enables the Party, the class, and the people to truly, correctly, specifically, and profoundly understand and grasp the essence of each social and economic structure, the laws of economic movement, its trends of change and development, and the class dynamics, class changes, and changes in class relations of all social classes. Based on this understanding, we can formulate strategic lines for revolutionary struggle to successfully carry out and complete the tasks of revolutionary struggle. It also ensures that the Party, the class, and the people are not influenced or corroded by those anti-Party, anti-proletarian, non-Party, and non-proletarian theories and ideas, and maintain their ideological and theoretical, and therefore also political and organizational, purity, preserving their authority in grasping objective truth without being obscured or distorted by them. Therefore, the Party character or Party spirit of Marxist-Leninist political economy is completely inseparable from the interests of the proletarian or working class's correct party – the Communist Party – and thus also from the interests of the proletarian and working class and the interests of the working people. This is because the political party of the proletarian or working class – the Communist Party – not only represents the interests of the proletarian and working class, but also represents the interests of all oppressed and exploited working people in the world today, representing the interests of all mankind. The highest, most concentrated, most systematic, and most generalized expression of these interests is the Party character or Party spirit in Marxist-Leninist scientific theory.

    The highest manifestation of the Party character or Party spirit of Marxist-Leninist political economy lies in the consistency and unity of Marxist-Leninist political economic theory and practice. The consistency and unity of theory and practice is also the fundamental source of the scientific and revolutionary nature of Marxist-Leninist political economy. What its theory embodies and guides is also what practice reflects and what practice must regulate. This means that what Marxist-Leninist theory expresses is not only a true reflection of objective social and economic practice, but also a guideline that the Communist Party and the proletariat must follow in their actions. It reveals the structure and essence of various social and economic formations, elaborates the laws of development of various social and economic systems, exposes the lives, dynamics, demands, and interrelationships of various classes, and directs us towards the direction and slogans of the proletarian revolutionary movement. It can lead the proletariat or working class and other working people forward, striving for the realization of communism throughout the world. Therefore, the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union teaches us: "The party of the working class cannot fulfill its role as the leader of its class, cannot fulfill its role as the organizer and leader of the proletarian revolution, if it does not master the advanced theory of the workers' movement, if it does not master the theory of Marxism-Leninism." "Only a party that has mastered the theory of Marxism-Leninism can move forward with certainty, can guide the working class forward." "Conversely, a party that has not mastered the theory of Marxism-Leninism is bound to wander and grope, be uncertain in its actions, and unable to lead the working class forward." (Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Conclusion) But to master the theory of Marxism-Leninism, one must first master "the laws of production development, the laws of socio-economic development," i.e., Marxist-Leninist political economy. Therefore, the theory of Marxist-Leninist political economy is so closely linked to the practical actions of the proletarian and working-class party – the Communist Party. Therefore, the Party character of Marxist-Leninist political economy is so inseparably linked and combined with the Party character of the proletarian and working-class party – the Communist Party. Their close combination serves as a bond guaranteeing the victory of the socialist revolutionary movement and the national proletarian revolutionary movements of the world's proletariat and working class, as well as the people's democratic revolutionary movements led by the proletariat. Therefore, in capitalist society, Marxist-Leninist political economy is a weapon for the Party to lead the proletariat in class struggle against the bourgeoisie, to resist and overthrow the capitalist system, and to achieve socialist revolution. In socialist society, it is the theoretical basis for the Party to lead the socialist working class in socialist economic construction, promote the development of socialist society, and also to criticize and struggle against various erroneous and opportunistic economic ideas and economic theories, and to serve as a weapon for criticism and self-criticism in the struggle between the old and the new in socialist society. In a new democratic society, political economy is the guiding principle and guiding theory for the Party to lead the working class and the masses of the people in new democratic economic construction, to struggle against and overcome various economic factors that hinder and undermine new democratic economic construction, to criticize various erroneous economic ideas and economic theories, to develop the new democratic economy, to build a new democratic society, and to prepare for a gradual transition to socialist society.

    Since Marxist-Leninist political economy was introduced to China, it has immediately become a powerful weapon for the Chinese proletariat and the Chinese Communist Party to dissect and analyze modern China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal society and its economic base. It has become a sharp tool for them to oppose and criticize various erroneous economic ideas, erroneous economic views, erroneous observations and understandings of the Chinese economy, as well as some counter-revolutionary economic theories and economic doctrines. Whether in the present, past, or future, in the people's liberation struggle led by the proletariat and the masses of the people, and even in the struggle to build a new democratic economy, we must firmly grasp this guiding theory and critical weapon.

    Therefore, Marxist-Leninist political economy, as its name clearly indicates, has class nature and Party character. The Chinese Communist Party is the party representing the working class, and it also represents the interests of the masses of the people. Therefore, this theory has an inseparable relationship with the Party's theory, the Party's line, principles, and policies. Its observation and understanding of society, its analysis of economic phenomena, its dissection of class and class relations, and the determination of the Party's line, principles, and policies, and the establishment of the Party's action resolutions are all closely linked. Moreover, they are all concrete manifestations of the Party character of Marxist-Leninist political economy.

　　Internationalism

    Although, according to Engels, "since the conditions under which people produce and exchange goods vary from country to country, and also change from generation to generation in the same country, it cannot be the same for all countries, for all historical periods," this does not mean that the universal truths of Marxist-Leninist political economy do not exist and cannot be applied to various different countries. In fact, on the contrary, the theory of Marxist-Leninist political economy not only can exist and be applied in one country or individual countries, but can also be applied in the same various countries or all countries. For example, Marx's analysis of the capitalist economy and the theory of revealing the laws of capitalist economic movement can be applied in countries where capitalism exists and develops; and Lenin's theoretical analysis of imperialism can also be applied to all imperialist countries and countries and spheres of influence penetrated and dominated by imperialist economic and political forces.

  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点

    第三节马列主义政治经济学的阶级性、党派性与国际性
    马列主义政治经济学的党派性或党性，就是要我们批判一切反无产阶级、反共产党、反马列主义，与其他非无产阶级、非马列主义的各种经济学说和主张，使党与阶级、与人民能够真正正确地、具体地、深刻地认识和把握每个社会经济结构的实质，经济运动的规律，它变化发展的趋向，和社会各阶级的阶级动态、阶级变动与阶级关系的变动等，并依此而定出革命斗争的策略路线来圆满地进行和完成革命斗争的任务。而使党、阶级和人民不受那些反党、反无产阶级、非党、非无产阶级的理论思想影响或侵蚀，并保持其思想上和理论上，从而也是政治上和组织上的纯洁性，保持它对客观真理把握的权威而不为它们所掩蔽所歪曲。所以马列主义政治经济学的党派性或党性，是和无产阶级或工人阶级的正党——共产党的利益，从而也是与无产阶级与工人阶级的利益和劳动人民的利益完全是不可分离的。因为无产阶级或工人阶级的政党——共产党，它不但代表着无产阶级和工人阶级的利益，而且代表现在世界所有一切被压迫被剥削的劳动人民的利益，代表着全人类的利益。而这种利益的最高最集中最系统最概括的表现，便是马列主义科学理论上的党派性或党性。
    马列主义政治经济学的党派性或党性的最高表现，便是在于马列主义政治经济学理论与实践的一致与统一性，理论与实践的一致和统一，也是马列主义政治经济学科学性革命性的基本泉源，它理论所体现和指导的，也是实践所反映，实践所必须规范的，这也就是说马列主义理论所表现的，不仅是社会经济客观实践的真实反映，而且也是共产党和无产阶级行动所必须依循的准绳，它揭露各种社会经济结构和实质，它阐发了各种社会经济的发展规律，它暴露了各阶级的生活、动态、要求与相互关系，它指示我们无产阶级革命运动的方向和口号，可以使我们领导无产阶级或工人阶级及其他劳动人民前进，为全世界的共产主义的实现而奋斗。因此，联共党史教导我们：“工人阶级的党不精通工人运动的先进理论，不精通马列主义理论，便不能实现其为本阶级领导者的作用，便不能实现其为无产阶级革命的组织者和领导者的作用。”“只有精通了马列主义理论的党，才能确有把握地向前进展，才能引导工人阶级前进。”“反之，没有精通马列主义理论的党，都不得不徘徊摸索，在行动上没有把握，不能领导工人阶级前进。”（联共党史简明教程结语）但要精通马列主义理论，必先要精通“生产发展的规律，社会经济发展的规律”，即马列主义政治经济学。因此，马列主义政治经济学的理论与无产阶级和工人阶级政党——共产党的实践行动是这样紧密地联结着。因此，马列主义政治经济学的党性与无产阶级和工人阶级政党——共产党的党性又是这样不可分离地联系着结合着。它们这样紧密地结合着成为保证全世界无产阶级和工人阶级，社会主义革命运动与各国无产阶级革命运动，以及无产阶级领导的人民民主革命运动胜利的纽带。因此，马列主义政治经济学，它在资本主义社会里，是党领导无产阶级与资产阶级进行阶级斗争反抗与推翻资本主义制度达成社会主义革命的理论斗争的武器。在社会主义社会里，它是党领导社会主义的工人阶级进行社会主义经济建设，推动社会主义社会发展的理论根据，同时也是对各种错误的以及机会主义的经济思想经济学说进行批判，进行斗争，并为社会主义社会新旧斗争批评与自我批评的武器。在新民主主义社会里，政治经济学，则是党领导工人阶级及人民大众进行新民主主义经济建设，与阻碍破坏新民主主义经济建设的各种经济因素进行斗争，战胜克服他们，批判各种错误的经济思想经济理论，发展新民主主义经济，建成新民主主义社会，准备逐步地过渡到社会主义社会去的指导原理，指导理论。
    自从马列主义政治经济学介绍到中国来以后，即刻就成了中国无产阶级，中国共产党解剖分析近代中国半殖民地半封建社会及其经济基础的有力武器。成为他们反对批判各种错误的经济思想，错误的经济见解，错误的对中国经济的观察与认识，以及一些反革命的经济理论经济学说斗争的锐利的利器。不论现在，过去与将来，在无产阶级领导人民大众进行人民解放斗争中，以至建设新民主主义经济的斗争中，都必须紧紧掌握这一指导的理论与批判的武器。
    所以，马列主义政治经济学，正如它的名称所明确显示的，是有阶级性党派性的。中国共产党是代表工人阶级的政党，同时也是代表人民大众的利益。所以这种理论与党的理论，党的路线，方针政策，有着不可分离的关系，它对于社会的观察认识，对于经济现象的分析，对于阶级与阶级关系的解剖，以及对于党的路线，方针政策的确定，与党的行动决议的成立，都是密切联系着的。而且它们也都是马列主义政治经济学党性的具体体现。
　　国际性
    马列主义政治经济学，虽然按照恩格斯的说法“由于人们在生产物品与交换物品时所处的条件，在各国各不相同，并且在同一国度里也是一代一代变化着的，因此它对于一切国度，对于一切历史时代，不能都是一样的”。但这并不是说马列主义政治经济不的普遍真理不存在，不能适用于各种不同的国家。而事实上，恰恰相反，马列主义政治经济学的理论，不但能够在一国内或个别国家内存在与适用，并且在同样的各个国家或一切国度内都可以适用的。例如马克思对资本主义经济的分析，揭发资本主义经济运动规律的理论，在有资本主义存在发展的国家内都是可以适用的；又如列宁对于帝国主义的理论分析也同样的可以适用于各帝国主义国家及有帝国主义经济政治势力浸透支配的国家与势力范围。
