Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 21st—Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government delivered a speech today at the General Celebration of Marshal Stalin's Seventieth Birthday held by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The full text is as follows:

　　Today is the seventieth birthday of Marshal Stalin, the leader of the Soviet people and the working people of the world. Today, not only the entire Soviet Union, but also all of China, the whole world, and all enlightened people are celebrating and cheering, celebrating Marshal Stalin's health and longevity.

　　Why do we celebrate Marshal Stalin's birthday?

　　First, Stalin, like Marx, Engels, and Lenin, pointed out to all mankind the only bright future for mankind, which is socialism and communism, and proved this truth with the successful facts of the Soviet Union. Marx and Engels pointed out that socialism is the only way out for mankind, but they passed away before seeing the realization of socialism. Lenin led the socialist revolution in the Soviet Union, making it the first socialist country in the world, but he also passed away in 1924 before seeing the success of socialist construction. Stalin not only led the socialist revolution together with Lenin, but also developed the theories and undertakings of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, and led the socialist construction of the Soviet Union to success. Now, the working people of the world have strengthened their confidence because they have seen the success of socialism; even the enemies of socialism cannot deny the fact that socialism has succeeded on one-sixth of the world's land. Realizing socialism is Stalin's first great achievement in human history, so all working people cannot but thank Stalin and celebrate Stalin.

　　Second, Stalin led the world in upholding international peace and people's democracy, defeating the fascist aggression and continuing to defeat the conspiracies of new war instigators. During World War II, the fascist group led by Hitler caused extremely serious disasters to mankind. Who led the world in extinguishing this disaster? Who played a decisive role in the great war to eliminate Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese warlords? It was Stalin, the Soviet army and people led by Stalin, and the anti-fascist, anti-imperialist people of the world led by Stalin. The Hitler group has been overthrown, and American imperialism has risen to take its place, trying its best to create new wars. However, under the leadership of Stalin, the peace-loving and democratic people of the world now have greater strength and higher awareness than before, and are now united to carry out a resolute struggle against new wars. Therefore, we believe that the danger of new wars can definitely be overcome. Defeating fascism and preventing the danger of new wars is Stalin's second great achievement in human history. Therefore, all peace-loving and democratic people cannot but thank Stalin and celebrate Stalin.

　　Third, Stalin pointed out the path to liberation to all oppressed nations and all colonial and semi-colonial peoples in the world, and helped them to achieve liberation with practical actions. Stalin pointed out to China and all other oppressed nations that the liberation movement of oppressed nations can only achieve victory if it stands with the Soviet Union, if it is combined with the socialist movement of the working class in the capitalist world, and if it is under the leadership of the proletariat of its own nation. Stalin pointed out that in colonial and semi-colonial countries, armed self-defense against armed enemies is of particular importance. Stalin and the Soviet people he led gave great assistance to the Chinese people's revolutionary war from 1925 to 1927 and to the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan from 1937 to 1945. In 1919, the Soviet government was the first to abolish the unequal treaties imposed on China by Tsarist Russia. This year, it was the first to establish equal and friendly diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and actively assisted the Chinese people in their economic recovery. All of this shows that Stalin is the best friend of the Chinese people and the best friend of the colonial and semi-colonial peoples of the world. Combining the socialist movement with the national liberation movement of oppressed peoples is Stalin's third great achievement in human history. Therefore, the Chinese people and the oppressed nations of the world cannot but thank Stalin and celebrate Stalin.

　　Stalin is the banner of socialism, the banner of lasting peace and people's democracy, and the banner of liberation for oppressed nations. In short, Stalin is the banner of victory for all progressive undertakings of mankind.

　　On behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, on behalf of the Chinese people, and on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, I celebrate the leader of progressive humanity, long live Stalin! Celebrate the best friend of the Chinese people, long live Stalin! Celebrate Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation, long live!

　　朱德副主席演说：
    斯大林是社会主义的旗帜是持久和平与民主的旗帜是被压迫民族解放的旗帜
    【新华社北京二十一日电】中央人民政府副主席朱德今日在中苏友好协会总庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰大会上发表演说，全文如下：
    今天是苏联人民和全世界劳动人民的领袖斯大林大元帅七十岁的生日。在今天，不但全苏联，而且全中国，全世界，一切觉悟的人民，都在欢呼庆祝，庆祝斯大林大元帅的健康和长寿。
    我们为什么要庆祝斯大林大元帅的寿辰呢？
    第一、斯大林和马克思、恩格斯、列宁一样，向全世界人类指出了人类的唯一光明前途，就是社会主义和共产主义，并且用苏联的成功的事实证明了这个真理。马克思、恩格斯指出，只有社会主义才是人类的出路，但是没有见到社会主义的实现就去世了。列宁在苏联领导了社会主义革命，使世界上有了第一个社会主义国家，但是他也没有见到社会主义建设的成功，就在一九二四年去世了。斯大林不但和列宁在一起领导了社会主义革命，而且发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁的学说和事业，领导了苏联社会主义建设达到成功。现在全世界的劳动人民，都因为看到了社会主义的成功，坚定了自己的信心；就是社会主义的敌人，对于社会主义已经在世界六分之一的土地上成功的事实，也没有办法否认了。实现社会主义，这是斯大林在人类历史上的第一个大功劳，所以一切劳动人民不能不感谢斯大林，庆祝斯大林。
    第二、斯大林领导全世界拥护国际和平与人民民主的人类，战胜了法西斯主义的进攻，并且正在继续战胜新战争挑拨者的阴谋。在第二次世界大战期间，希特勒所领导的法西斯集团曾经对于人类造成了极端严重的灾难。谁领导世界扑灭了这场灾难呢？在消灭希特勒、墨索里尼和日本军阀的大战中，谁起了决定的作用呢？这就是斯大林，就是斯大林所领导的苏联军民，就是斯大林所领导的全世界反法西斯主义反帝国主义的人民。希特勒集团打倒了，美帝国主义又起而代之，竭力制造新战争。但是在斯大林领导之下的全世界爱好和平民主的人类，现在已经有了比以前更大的力量、更高的觉悟，现在已经团结起来进行反对新战争的坚决斗争。因此我们相信，新战争的危险一定可以战胜。战胜法西斯主义，阻止新战争危险，这是斯大林在人类历史上的第二个大功劳。所以一切爱好和平民主的人类不能不感谢斯大林，庆祝斯大林。
    第三、斯大林向全世界被压迫民族，向全世界殖民地半殖民地人民指出了解放的道路，并且用实际行动援助他们得到解放。斯大林向中国和其他一切被压迫民族指出：被压迫民族的解放运动，只有和苏联站在一起，只有和资本主义世界工人阶级的社会主义运动结合在一起，只有在本民族的无产阶级领导之下，才能够得到胜利。斯大林指出：在殖民地半殖民地国家中，向武装的敌人进行武装的自卫斗争，有特别重要的意义。斯大林和他所领导的苏联人民，对于中国人民在一九二五年到一九二七年的革命战争，对于中国人民在一九三七年到一九四五年的抗日战争，都给了伟大的援助。苏联政府在一九一九年首先废除了帝俄在中国的不平等条约，在今年首先和中华人民共和国建立平等友好的外交关系，并且积极地援助了中国人民的经济恢复工作。这一切都说明斯大林是中国人民最好的朋友，也是全世界殖民地半殖民地人民最好的朋友。把社会主义运动和被压迫民族解放运动结合在一起，这是斯大林在人类历史上第三个大功劳。所以中国人民和全世界被压迫民族不能不感谢斯大林，庆祝斯大林。
    斯大林是社会主义的旗帜，是持久和平和人民民主的旗帜，是被压迫民族解放的旗帜。总起来说，斯大林是人类一切进步事业胜利的旗帜。
    我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府，代表中国人民解放军，代表中国人民，代表中国共产党，庆祝进步人类的领袖斯大林万岁！庆祝中国人民最好的朋友斯大林万岁！庆祝中苏友好合作万岁！
