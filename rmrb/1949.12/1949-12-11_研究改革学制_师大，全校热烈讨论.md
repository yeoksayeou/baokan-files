　　Research and Reform the Education System
  　Normal University Engages in Enthusiastic Discussion Throughout the School
    [Our Newspaper] Normal University has been contemplating the reform of the education system for a long time. For more than half a year, everyone has discussed the issues of university duration, curriculum content, and teaching methods three times, laying the foundation for preliminary reform.

    Since Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Education, came to the school on the 29th of last month to give a report on the reform of Normal University, the university has formed the "Normal University Improvement Research Committee" as the highest leading body for the reform, and is carrying out the work in stages. So far, all teachers, students, workers, and police in the school have been engaged in in-depth discussions around the following issues: 1. The tasks of the Normal University in the future; 2. Whether or not departments should continue to exist; 3. Review of the curriculum and teaching methods of each department; 4. Review of the administrative organization. Among them, the discussion of the first question is the most profound and clear. Everyone unanimously believes that the main task of the Normal University is to train teachers for secondary schools and social education, as well as some educational administrators. Moreover, the discussion further explored "Does the Normal University also have the task of researching advanced academics?" The conclusion is that researching advanced academics is necessary, but it should be centered on teaching secondary schools well and doing a good job in education. As for whether departments need to exist, some students believe that the past division of departments was in line with the reactionary university system (at least three departments were required to become a university). In the future, it will not be a formal Normal University, but a "People's Normal University" that meets practical needs. Curriculum content and teaching methods are discussed according to the situation of each department. However, one principle is that the new curriculum content must have the viewpoints and positions of Marxism-Leninism, and be determined with the needs of secondary schools in mind. Teaching methods must be practical and strengthen the internship system. Regarding the school's administrative organization, improvements or revisions should be made in response to past shortcomings and according to the actual work needs of each department, and the spirit of "democratic centralism" should be fully promoted in leadership.

    In order to further develop the work, the Improvement Research Committee has decided to continue the discussion starting on the 7th of this month, focusing on "the reform of the existing class curriculum".

### 研究改革学制　师大，全校热烈讨论

　　研究改革学制
  　师大，全校热烈讨论
    【本报讯】师大改革学制酝酿已久，半年多来，大家曾对大学年限、课程内容、教学方法等问题，作了三番五次的讨论，奠下了初步改革的基础。
    自上月二十九日教育部钱俊瑞副部长来校作了关于师大改革的报告后，师大即组成“师大改进研究委员会”，作为改革的最高领导机构，分期展开工作。到目前为止全校师生工警都围绕着下列几个问题作深刻的讨论：一、今后师范大学的任务；二、院系应否存在；三、各系课程与教学方法的检讨；四、行政组织检讨。其中尤以第一个问题讨论最深刻最明确，大家都一致认为师大的主要任务为培养中等学样与社会教育师资和一部分教育行政人员，而且，更进一步的讨论到“师大是否也负有研究高深学术的任务？”结论是研究高深学术是应该的，不过应以教好中学与搞好教育为中心。至于院系是否有存在的必要，有些同学的意见认为过去的分院是符合反动派的大学制度（至少三院才成为大学），今后并不是形式上的师范大学，而是要做到实际需要的“人民师范大学”。课程内容与教学方法是根据各系的情况而讨论，然而有一原则就是新课程内容必须是有马列主义的观点、立场，针对着中学的需要而定，教学方法必须要做到联系实际，加强实习制度。关于学校行政组织，应针对以往缺点，根据各部门之实际工作需要而改进或重定，在领导上要充分发扬“民主集中制”的精神。
    为了进一步的展开工作，改进研究委员会定本月七日开始以“现有班的课程之改革”为中心继续讨论。
