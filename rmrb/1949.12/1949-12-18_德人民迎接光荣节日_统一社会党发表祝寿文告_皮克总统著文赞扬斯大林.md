In an article published in the magazine, Grotewohl said: "Peace-loving humanity celebrates Stalin's 70th birthday as a great festival, and they highly value Stalin's historical contributions. The cause of peace and socialism finds unwavering support in the Soviet Union and in Stalin himself. Stalin and the Soviet Union have given workers all over the world confidence in a bright future. On the day of Stalin's 70th birthday, hundreds of millions of people around the world sincerely wish him good health, expressing their love for Stalin. They consider Stalin to be the great organizer and fighter for the cause of socialism and peace.” In his article entitled "Stalin – Leader and Teacher of the International Proletariat," Pieck pointed out: The international working class considers Comrade Stalin to be its teacher and leader. He creatively developed the doctrines of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, and applied these doctrines with genius to the situations arising from historical progress.

The Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, has arranged fourteen lectures in Berlin to commemorate Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday. These lectures fully illustrate that Stalin is the leader of the working people of the world, a brilliant thinker, a military leader, and an outstanding statesman. Mass leaders Alexander Abusch and Obermann will deliver the following speeches: "Stalin and the Struggle for German Unity" and "Stalin and the German Working Class Movement."

The letter emphasizes that the revival of democratic Germany is entirely due to the assistance of the progressive democratic forces of all countries, especially the assistance of the Soviet people under the leadership of Marshal Stalin, the most loyal and friendly friend of democratic Germany. The letter calls on all farmers of the German Democratic Republic to actively cooperate in consolidating German-Soviet friendship.
