　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 19th: A large number of Soviet agricultural machinery workers have participated in a nationwide mass competition launched to celebrate the 70th birthday of the great Stalin. Workers at machine and tractor stations have guaranteed to prepare the machines needed for spring field work ahead of schedule to celebrate this glorious festival and to greet Stalin's birthday with significant production victories. Machine and tractor stations cultivated approximately 46 million hectares more of collective farm land than last year, and greatly exceeded the pre-war level of mechanized cultivation.
    Soviet agriculture is the most advanced and mechanized agriculture in the world. The universally distributed network of machine and tractor stations established according to Stalin's suggestion has greatly helped farmers to transition to collective farming and for collective farms to master the latest achievements in agricultural science. The Soviet Union now has about eight thousand machine and tractor stations fully equipped with first-class technology. Machine stations are also being established for collective farm afforestation, the construction of reservoirs and ponds, the cultivation of grasslands and pastures, and livestock breeding, following the example of machine and tractor stations, to mechanize labor-intensive processes.
    Before the war, three-quarters of the land in Soviet collective farms was worked by tractors, and nearly half of the grain was harvested by combine harvesters. Recently, the machine and tractor station network has not only been restored, but has also been expanded. The efficiency of machines has also been improved. For example, the average total work done by each tractor per year now exceeds the pre-war level by 13 percent. This year, electric tractors were used in farmland for the first time. Now, combine harvesters are used not only to harvest grain, but also to harvest flax, potatoes, and sugar beets, and the latest types of machines are used to pick cotton, plant tobacco, and trees.
    Thanks to the great Stalin's fatherly concern for the mechanization of agriculture, millions of collective farms have been able to enjoy prosperity. Due to the mechanization of cultivation, the labor required by collective farms to cultivate one hectare of land has been reduced by one-half, and the labor to harvest one “pood” (approximately 16 kg) of grain has been reduced by two-thirds.
    Agricultural mechanization is of great importance in victoriously completing the historic task of eliminating the gap between town and country. Machine and tractor stations are small industrial centers in agricultural areas, with their own repair shops, power stations, agricultural experiment stations, and clubs. Due to the mechanization of agriculture, millions of peasants have become tractor drivers, combine drivers, and mechanics.

### 在斯大林英明领导下　苏联农业加速机械化  农业机械工作者参加祝寿竞赛

　　在斯大林英明领导下
  　苏联农业加速机械化
    农业机械工作者参加祝寿竞赛
    【新华社北京十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联大批农业机械工作者已参加了为庆祝伟大斯大林七十寿辰而发起的全国规模的群众性竞赛。机器和拖拉机站的工人已保证先期准备好春季农田工作所需要的机器，来庆祝这一光辉的节日，并以显著的生产胜利来迎接斯大林的寿辰。机器和拖拉机站耕作了较去年多出约四千六百万公顷的集体农场的农田，并且大大地超过了战前机械化耕作的水平。
    苏联农业是世界上最进步和最机械化的农业。按照斯大林的建议而建立起来的普遍分布的机器和拖拉机站网，对于农民转变到集体耕作和集体农场掌握农业科学上的最新成就，有莫大帮助。苏联现在拥有完全装备着头等技术的约八千个机器和拖拉机站。集体农场的造林工作、建筑储水池和池塘的工作、栽培草地与牧场的工作和牲畜饲养方面的工作，也正在效法机器和拖拉机站而建立起机器站，使消耗劳动的过程机械化。
    战前，苏联的集体农场即已有四分之三的土地由拖拉机来工作，并且几有一半的谷物由联合机来收割。最近，机器和拖拉机站网不仅已经恢复，并且已经扩大了。机器的效率也已提高，例如，现在每台拖拉机每年平均工作总数就超过战前的百分之十三。今年，在农田上首次使用了电动拖拉机。现在，农业中不仅用联合机收割谷物，并且也用来收割亚麻、马铃薯和甜菜，并用最新型的机器来采棉、种植烟草和树木。
    由于伟大的斯大林对农业机械化的慈父般的关怀，千万个集体农场方得享受富裕。由于耕作的机械化，集体农场在耕作一公顷土地时所需的劳动，已减少了二分之一，而收获一丁纳（合二百市斤）谷物的劳动，就减少了三分之二。
    农业机械化在胜利地完成消灭城乡间鸿沟的历史性任务上，有巨大的重要性。机器和拖拉机站是农业区域中的小的工业中心，它们设有自己的修理间、电力站、农业实验所和俱乐部。由于农业的机械化，千百万农民已成为拖拉机司机、康拜因机司机和机械师等。
