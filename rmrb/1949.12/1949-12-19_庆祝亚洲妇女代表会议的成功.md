　　Celebrating the Success of the Asian Women's Representative Conference
    The Asian Women's Representative Conference, convened under the leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation, has concluded victoriously. Progressive people all over the world are celebrating the complete success of this conference. The people of our capital, at yesterday's celebration rally, representing the people of all of China, unanimously praised the outstanding achievements of the Asian Women's Representative Conference and expressed their willingness to strive for the realization of all its resolutions.
    The Asian Women's Representative Conference, attended by representatives and guests from twenty-three countries, demonstrated the broad unity of the Women's International Democratic Federation. The entire spirit of the conference illustrates the fact that the international peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is growing stronger. Based on the experience of women's movements in various countries, this conference pointed out a truth, namely, that women in colonial and semi-colonial countries must unite, actively participate in the national liberation movement under the leadership of the proletariat and its political parties, participate in armed struggle, oppose imperialism and its running dogs in various countries. This increasingly strong force, coupled with the assistance of the international peace and democracy camp, will surely be able to defeat the imperialists' conspiracies to provoke new wars, repel their aggression against various nations, eliminate their running dogs and agents in various colonial countries, and achieve lasting world peace, people's democracy, and the complete liberation of the broad masses of women.
    Asia has been enslaved by imperialism for centuries. Until the end of the 19th century, the East, except for Japan, became a colony and semi-colony of imperialism. Half of the world's population was thrown into hell, and women suffered particularly deep oppression. However, "waves of blood cannot drown the truth." The people of the East and the women of the East have successively launched long and brutal heroic struggles against imperialist enslavement, and have continuously achieved victories. The Soviet Union's October Revolution opened up a path for all mankind to completely break capitalist oppression and strive for the liberation of the working people and the broad masses of women. Since then, women in the Soviet Union have obtained the same democratic rights and freedoms as men, and have become a model and leader for women throughout Asia. Women in Outer Mongolia and North Korea have been liberated with the direct and powerful assistance of the Soviet Union. For decades, the broad masses of women in our country have actively participated in the national liberation movement led by the Communist Party, participated in the democratic movement and armed struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. This struggle, with the assistance of the world democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union, finally forged a new China of people's democracy. Now, women in our country, together with the entire people, are doing their best to support the People's Liberation Army in wiping out the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang, and at the same time actively participating in industrial and agricultural production to build their own beautiful and happy motherland. The vast majority of Vietnam's territory has been liberated, and Vietnamese women are also struggling to build their own completely independent motherland.
    The existing experience of various countries has proven that the national liberation movement of colonial and semi-colonial countries cannot be victorious without the participation of the broad masses of women. Only by actively participating in the national liberation movement can women in these countries truly liberate themselves. Now, through the Asian Women's Representative Conference, the people and women of the East have the best opportunity to concentrate the rich experiences of various countries, which is convenient for guiding the women's movement in various countries, and the success of this conference lies in this. We believe that with the mature experience of the women's movements in various countries, with more countries that have already achieved revolutionary victory willing to help other nations, and with the high degree of unity, confidence, and awareness of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the cause of the liberation of the people and the liberation of women in the whole of Asia will gradually achieve greater and even comprehensive victory.

### 庆祝亚洲妇女代表会议的成功

　　庆祝亚洲妇女代表会议的成功
    在国际民主妇联领导之下召开的亚洲妇女代表会议，已经胜利闭幕了。全世界进步人类都在庆贺这个会议的完满成功。我国首都人民在昨天的庆祝大会上，代表着全中国的人民，一致颂扬亚洲妇女代表会议的卓越成就，表示愿为实现它的一切决议而奋斗。
    二十三个国家的代表与来宾参加的亚洲妇女代表会议，显示了国际民主妇女的广泛团结。大会的整个精神说明一个事实：即以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营越发坚强壮大了。这个会议，依据各国妇女运动的经验，指明了一个真理，即各殖民地半殖民地国家的妇女必须团结起来，在无产阶级及其政党领导之下，积极参加民族解放运动，参加武装斗争，反对帝国主义及其在各国的走狗。这种越来越大的力量加上国际和平民主阵营的援助，就一定能够战胜帝国主义者挑拨新战争的阴谋，打退它们对于各民族的侵略，消灭它们在各殖民地国家的走狗和代理人，获致世界持久和平，人民民主和广大妇女的彻底解放。
    亚洲被帝国主义奴役了几个世纪。迄十九世纪末叶，世界的东方除了日本而外，都成了帝国主义的殖民地与半殖民地。世界人口的半数被投入地狱中，妇女们所受的压迫尤为深重。但是，“血的浪涛是淹没不了真理的”，东方的人民和东方的妇女曾前仆后继地展开了长期残酷的反对帝国主义奴役的英勇斗争，并不断获得了胜利。苏联的十月革命给全人类开辟了一条彻底打破资本压迫、争取劳动人民和广大妇女解放的大道，从那时起，苏联的妇女就获得了与男子同样的民主权利与自由，并成为全亚洲妇女的模范和领袖。外蒙古和北朝鲜的妇女，在苏联直接的强有力的援助下，已获解放。几十年来，我国广大妇女积极参加了共产党领导的民族解放运动，参加了反对帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义的民主运动和武装斗争，这种斗争得到以苏联为首的世界民主力量的援助，终于打出了一个人民民主的新中国。现在，我国妇女正和全体人民一起，尽力支援人民解放军所荡国民党匪帮残余，同时积极参加工农业生产，建设自己美好幸福的祖国。越南绝大部分国土已经解放，越南妇女也正在为建设自己的完全独立的祖国而奋斗。
    各国已有的经验都证明：没有广大妇女参加的殖民地半殖民地国家的民族解放运动不是能胜利的。这些国家的妇女也只有积极参加民族解放运动，才能真正解放自己。现在，通过亚洲妇女代表会议，使东方的人民与妇女有了最好的机会，集中各国丰富的经验，便于指导各国的妇女运动，这个会议的成功就在于此。我们相信，有了各国妇女运动的成熟经验，有了更多愿意帮助其他民族的业已取得革命胜利的国家，有了国际民主妇女高度的团结、信心和觉悟，全亚洲的人民解放和妇女解放的事业，必将逐步获得更大的直至全面的胜利。
