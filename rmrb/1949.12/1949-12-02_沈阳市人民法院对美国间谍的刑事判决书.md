　　Facts and Reasons

　　Defendant Sasaki Hirotsune, Japanese alias Sakuma Yu, Chinese alias Zhang Zhizhong, engaged in Japanese secret service work in the Xing'anling area during the puppet Manchukuo period. After the Japanese bandits surrendered on August 15, 1945, he came to Shenyang and became an intelligence officer of the Kuomintang bandit Ministry of National Defense's Second Department in May 1947. Around October 1947, he was introduced to Nishida within the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang by the Japanese American spy Kita shi@① Takuji to act as a spy, his code name being S.S.K. This criminal translated intelligence for Nishida and recruited four Japanese secret agents, Tani Tohtsuji, Sawada Yoshio, Shimokawa Sadatsugu, and Hirai Nobuyuki, as his espionage pawns, actively collecting our military and political intelligence such as "Harbin military and political situation" and "Harbin internal and external security situation." He went to the "American Consulate" once or twice a week to report to Nishida. After being transferred to the leadership of the "American Military Liaison Group Shenyang Branch" with Nishida on January 5, 1948, he developed five more people, including Xiao Yaoting, to join his espionage organization. In May 1948, he sent Xiao Yaoting to infiltrate our liberated areas such as Siping to collect important intelligence such as "Kaiyuan People's Liberation Army movements" and "Siping military, political, economic, and social dynamics" and provide it to American espionage agencies. At the same time, the American espionage organization with another code name "T.S." established by Nishida was also placed under the command of Sasaki Hirotsune. According to Sasaki Hirotsune's report to Nishida in April 1948 on the distribution of the "T.S." espionage organization that had been established: "The headquarters moved to Beiping in February 1937, with branches in Shenyang and Beiping. The intelligence outposts under the Shenyang branch are in Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Tumen, Hailar, Manzhouli, and Hunchun," etc., eleven places. By this point, the espionage organization under this criminal's control had become increasingly large.

　　After June 1948, this criminal successively recruited eleven people, including Yang Chaohe, Yamamura Yoshiaki, Sakashita Kiichi, Takeuchi Hajime, and Cao Chengde, to join his espionage organization.

　　Yang Chaohe, alias Yanai Yuichi, served as an intelligence officer in the Kuomintang bandit Liaoning Police Headquarters in May 1947 and as an intelligence officer in the Kuomintang bandit Ministry of National Defense's Second Department Shenyang Station after June 1948. He joined the American espionage organization in August of the same year. Yamamura Yoshiaki was originally a lieutenant company commander in the Japanese Kwantung Army garrison force. After the Japanese bandits surrendered on August 15, 1945, he participated in espionage work in the Kuomintang bandit Cavalry Headquarters and the 53rd Army. He also joined the American espionage organization in August 1948. These criminals Yang Chaohe, Yamamura Yoshiaki, Sakashita Kiichi, and Takeuchi Hajime all carried out the task of stealing our military and political intelligence under the command of Sasaki Hirotsune. Yang Chaohe stole our "People's Liberation Army's September offensive dynamics" and received a reward of 3 million counterfeit circulation coupons. Yamamura Yoshiaki collected important intelligence such as "the political situation in the liberated areas" and "the troop deployment of the People's Liberation Army in Siping and Kaiyuan" and handed it over to Sasaki Hirotsune. Sakashita Kiichi also collected intelligence such as "the transportation situation of the North Manchurian Railway," "the highway transportation situation in Inner Mongolia," and "the train transportation statistics table of Binjiang Station." Takeuchi Hajime took various photos of the Heilongjiang upper reaches area in the liberated area and used his residence as a meeting place for spies. Cao Chengde, a native of Inner Mongolia, was originally an employee of the puppet Manchukuo government. He joined the American espionage organization in 1948 through the introduction of Xiao Yaoting and successively collected intelligence such as "the organizational overview of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government" and "the resumes and living conditions of the main responsible persons."

　　In total, Sasaki Hirotsune collected 78 pieces of important intelligence from us and handed them over to Nishida, thus receiving written rewards from Nishida.

　　In October 1948, the American espionage agency, in view of Shenyang's impending liberation, in order to continue sabotaging the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people, ordered Sasaki Hirotsune and others to go underground through Nishida. Sasaki Hirotsune, in accordance with Nishida's instructions, drafted the "October Underground Activity Plan," deciding to use Xiao Yaoting, Sakashita Kiichi, Yang Chaohe, Yamamura Yoshiaki, Takeuchi Hajime, and the "T.S." espionage organization commanded by Sasaki Hirotsune to open stores as cover, using the Yali Restaurant as an espionage liaison point, continue to lie dormant in Shenyang, and strengthen the task of stealing military and political intelligence from our People's Liberation Army, liberated areas, and Inner Mongolia. Cao Chengde was responsible for drafting the "Work Plan for Various Stations Under the Eastern Mongolia Headquarters," deciding to establish a general intelligence station in Shenyang—with liaison stations in Wangyemiao, Changchun, Siping, Jinzhou, Zhengjiatun, Tongliao, and other places, with sixteen intelligence officers, under the unified command of Sasaki Hirotsune, with Sakashita Kiichi as his assistant. On October 26, 1948, Sasaki Hirotsune and Sakashita Kiichi went to Nishida at the "American Army Liaison Group Shenyang Branch" to receive the underground mission, and received two American-made R.D.R. AC-DC 15-watt transceivers, one small generator, one set of American-made ciphers, five gold ingots, American cigarettes, and other supplies as espionage communication tools and activity funds. After the liberation of Shenyang, this was discovered by our Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the defendants were arrested one after another, and the above-mentioned radio stations and supplies were seized.

　　The criminal facts of the defendants have already been confessed in court by the principal offender Sasaki Hirotsune regarding his role as an American spy, establishing an espionage organization under the command of American espionage agencies, collecting our military and political secrets, regularly sending them to Nishida on the second floor of the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang, and arranging underground work and setting up secret radio stations, etc., and the details of the sabotage activities have all been confessed in court. Furthermore, the co-defendants Yang Chaohe, Sakashita Kiichi, Xiao Yaoting, Yamamura Yoshiaki, Cao Chengde, and Takeuchi Hajime have testified in court about the specific details of the crimes without error, and there are conclusive pieces of evidence such as the letters of instruction seized from Nishida, the work plans of the criminals, the activities of the American espionage organization, the resumes of personnel, as well as the intelligence drafts, radio stations, and ciphers from previous times, which are sufficient to prove that the defendants Sasaki and others constituted the crime of espionage endangering the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people.

　　Defendant Boyan Cang participated in the Japanese puppet organization during the puppet Manchukuo period and served the enemy for a long time. After the Kuomintang bandits occupied Changchun, this criminal served as a spy through the introduction of American spies Nakamura Joji and Aso Tatsuo on January 7, 1947, and was under the leadership of Li Jiasheng, the head of the "American Army Liaison Group Changchun Branch." His espionage code name was TOAS#4. In February of the same year, he was ordered by Li Jiasheng to accompany another Mongolian traitor and American spy Tao Ke Tao to Zhengjiatun and other places to organize Mongolian traitors to carry out sabotage activities and attempted to "策反" our Inner Mongolia government military and political personnel and conspire to instigate a coup in Inner Mongolia. In July of the same year, he was ordered by Li Jiasheng to establish intelligence stations in our liberated areas of Qian Gorlos Banner, Baichengzi, Wangyemiao, and Hailar. During the period before the "American Army Liaison Group Changchun Branch" withdrew, this criminal successively collected important intelligence such as "the political activities and organizational situation of Wangyemiao in Inner Mongolia," "the current military and political situation in Wangyemiao," "the railway situation from Qiqihar to Baichengzi," "the organizational and work situation of the Qian Gorlos Banner People's Government," "the situation of the Ethnic Representatives Conference in Harbin," "the dynamics of important officials in Wangyemiao," and "the situation of the liberated areas between Changchun and Tieling" and sent them to Li Jiasheng, the head of the "American Army Liaison Group Changchun Branch." In November 1947, the enemy in Changchun was in imminent danger under our army's encirclement, and the "American Army Liaison Branch" was forced to withdraw from Changchun and move to Beiping. This criminal was still under the leadership of Li Jiasheng, and Nakamura Joji and Aso Tatsuo were often sent to inspect his work. Subsequently, due to the interruption of communication, this criminal came to Shenyang on July 13, 1948, according to the original plan to contact the "American Army Liaison Group Shenyang Branch" and sent the "changes in the organization of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government and the resumes of the newly appointed responsible persons" to the espionage agency. After that, he carried out espionage sabotage activities under the leadership of Shen Lefu, the head of the Shenyang American Army Liaison Branch, and his assistant Nishida. On October 27 of the same year, on the eve of the liberation of Shenyang, Mydam from the Shanghai American Army Liaison Group headquarters came to Shenyang to arrange underground work and summoned the criminal to the group, awarded him the underground mission, and handed him two American-made R.D.R. AC-DC 15-watt transceivers, one hand-cranked generator, ten American-made ciphers, and 300 US dollars and sixteen bags of foreign flour as communication and activity funds. After the liberation of Shenyang, our Municipal Public Security Bureau detected this and arrested him.

　　Based on the above facts and evidence, defendant Boyan Cang, a Mongolian traitor, acted as an American spy, established an espionage organization, actively stole our military and political secrets, and provided them to American espionage agencies, and attempted to instigate rebellion, which is sufficient to constitute the crime of espionage between selling out the interests of the people of the motherland and sabotaging the revolutionary cause of the people.

　　Defendant Wu Renjie (alias Li Jiade) worked as an English translator at the Shenyang office of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in 1946. In December of that year, he accompanied American spy Balanson to Tongliao in northern Liaoning to steal intelligence from our liberated areas under the guise of investigating relief efforts. In December 1947, he was formally employed as an American spy through the introduction of American spy Balanson (Barandson) and was under the leadership of the spy Wells (Walsh) in the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang. In March 1948, he was transferred to the leadership of the spy Hnnt on the second floor of the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang and was responsible for intelligence traffic between Shenyang and Tianjin. He had transported our military and political secrets from the liberated areas from Shenyang to Tianjin. After this criminal was transferred to the leadership of Hunter, the intelligence was delivered to this criminal by a person named Minami. When face-to-face instructions were required, they were all in accordance with Hunter's instructions, entering Hunter's office on the second floor of the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang in the evening. On October 12, 1948, after this criminal returned to Shenyang from Tianjin, Hunter told him that "land transmission of intelligence has ceased, and communication will be changed to radio." On October 28, Shenyang was in danger, and Hunter summoned the criminal to Hunter's office next to the office of Walter on the second floor of the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang to receive the underground mission and provided activity funds, ten gold bars and gold ingots in total. Hunter used a car to send two American-made R.D.R. AC-DC 15-watt transceivers, one hand-cranked generator, five American-made ciphers, and a box of cigarettes to the criminal's home. After the liberation of Shenyang, this criminal hid in the Hanzhong Clinic at Building 3, No. 3 Heping New Village. This was detected by our Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the criminal was arrested.

　　The defendant Wu Renjie, acting as a liaison for American espionage agencies, responsible for transmitting intelligence and setting up secret radio stations to carry out espionage and sabotage activities, the evidence from the seized radio ciphers and his confession of facts are sufficient to constitute his crime of sabotaging the revolutionary cause of the people of the motherland.

　　It has been found that the defendants Sasaki Hirotsune, Boyan Cang, Wu Renjie, and others regularly received instructions on espionage activities at the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang and the former American Army Liaison Branch in Changchun, received funds to carry out espionage activities, and provided intelligence on Chinese state secrets. All of the above proves that the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang and the former American Army Liaison Branch in Shenyang and Changchun were all espionage command and cover agencies of American imperialism. In particular, the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang, as the location of the American Army Liaison Branch (i.e., the American espionage agency's 44th Overseas Observation Group), housed espionage ringleaders (such as Nishida, Wells, Hunter, etc.) in the consulate and covered up their espionage activities. It has truly become a center of conspiracy and criminal activities that endanger the national interests of the People's Republic of China and sabotage the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people, which is intolerable to the people of the People's Republic of China. In order to protect the interests of the state and people of the People's Republic of China, the entire foreign personnel of the former "American Consulate" in Shenyang should be expelled from the country.

　　In summary, except for the defendant Cao Chengde, who died of illness while on bail pending trial during the legal proceedings, which should be suspended from trial, and the former "American Army Liaison Branch" in Shenyang and Changchun, which has left the territory of the People's Republic of China and is not discussed for the time being, the judgment is hereby made as the main text.

    事实暨理由
    被告佐佐木弘经，日本化名佐久间佑，中国化名张执中，伪满时即在兴安岭一带从事日寇特务工作，一九四五年八月十五日日寇投降后来沈阳，于一九四七年五月充蒋匪国防部第二厅情报员，一九四七年十月间经美国间谍日人北ｓｈí＠①卓次介绍给前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”内之西田充当间谍，其代号为Ｓ·Ｓ·Ｋ·。该犯为西田翻译情报，并收罗日本特务谷户通滋、泽田义夫、下川贞次、平井信行等四人为其间谍爪牙，积极搜集我军政情报如“哈尔滨军政情况”“哈尔滨内外治安情况”等，每周赴“美领事馆”一次或二次，向西田汇报工作，一九四八年一月五日随西田转“美军联络团沈阳分团”领导后又发展了肖耀庭等五人，参加其间谍组织，并于一九四八年五月派肖耀庭混入我解放区四平等地先后搜集我“开原解放军动向”“四平军政经济及社会动态”等重要情报，供给美国间谍机关，同时西田建立的另一代号“Ｔ·Ｓ·”的美国间谍组织亦交由佐佐木弘经指挥，据一九四八年四月佐佐木弘经向西田报告已建立的“Ｔ·Ｓ·”间谍组织分布情况是：“本部于三七年二月迁北平，支部有沈阳、北平两地，沈阳支部所属情报据点有长春、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、图们、海拉尔、满洲里、珲春，”等十一处，至此该犯统辖之间谍组织已日益扩大。
    一九四八年六月后该犯又先后吸收杨朝和、山村嘉昭、坂下喜一、竹内始、曹承德等十一人参加其间谍组织。
    杨朝和化名柳井友一，于一九四七年五月曾任蒋匪辽宁警察总队情报员，一九四八年六月后为蒋匪国防部第二厅沈阳站情报员，同年八月加入美间谍组织。山村嘉昭，原系日寇关东军警备部队中尉中队长，一九四五年八月十五日日寇投降后，曾参加蒋匪骑兵总队及五十三军作谍报工作，亦于一九四八年八月加入美间谍组织，该犯杨朝和、山村嘉昭、坂下喜一、竹内始等，均在佐佐木弘经指挥之下进行刺探我军政情报。杨朝和曾刺探我“解放军九月攻势动态”获得报酬伪流通券三百万圆。山村嘉昭曾搜集我“解放区政治情况”“四平、开原解放军兵力配备状况”等重要情报交与佐佐木弘经，坂下喜一亦曾搜集我“北满铁路运输情况”“内蒙公路交通情况”“滨江站火车运输统计表”等情报。竹内始，曾拍照解放区黑龙江上游地区之各种照片，并以其住宅作间谍接头地点。曹承德内蒙古人，原为伪满职员，一九四八年经肖耀庭介绍参加美间谍组织，曾先后搜集我“内蒙人民自治政府组织概况”、“主要负责人简历、生活情况”等情报。
    总计佐佐木弘经前后共搜集我重要情报七十八件，交给西田因而得到西田书面奖励。
    一九四八年十月美国间谍机关，因鉴于沈阳行将解放，为了继续破坏中国人民革命事业，乃由西田令被告佐佐木弘经等转入潜伏活动，佐佐木弘经，当遵照西田指示，拟订“十月潜伏活动计划”决定以肖耀庭、坂下喜一、杨朝和、山村嘉昭、竹内始，及佐佐木弘经所指挥之“Ｔ·Ｓ·”间谍组织用开设商店为掩护，以亚利餐厅为间谍联络据点，继续潜伏沈阳活动，加强刺探我解放军解放区及内蒙之军政情报。并由曹承德负责拟订“东蒙本部所属各站工作计划”决定在沈阳设立情报总站——王爷庙、长春、四平、锦州、郑家屯、通辽等地设联络站，情报员为十六名，由佐佐木弘经统一指挥，坂下喜一为助手，一九四八年十月二十六日，佐佐木弘经偕同坂下喜一至“美陆军联络团沈阳分团”西田处受领潜伏任务，并领回美制Ｒ·Ｄ·Ｒ·式交流直流两用十五瓦特收发报机两部，小型发电机一台，美制密码一套，及金元宝五个，美国纸烟等物资，作为间谍通报工具和活动经费。沈阳解放后，为我市公安局侦悉，当先后将被告等逮捕，并查获上列电台及物资。
    查被告等之犯罪事实，业已由主犯佐佐木弘经对于充当美国间谍，在美国间谍机关指挥下建立间谍组织，搜集我军政机密情报，经常送交前驻沈“美领馆”二楼西田处，并布置潜伏工作、架设秘密电台等破坏活动之经过详情均已当庭供认不讳，复经共同被告杨朝和、坂下喜一、肖耀庭、山村嘉昭、曹承德、竹内始等，就犯罪之具体经过，当庭质对不误，且有查获之西田指示信，该犯等工作计划，美间谍组织活动情况，人员履历，以及历次情报纸稿、电台、密码等确凿证据，足以证明被告佐佐木等构成危害中国人民革命事业之间间谍罪行。
    被告伯彦苍于伪满时即参加日伪组织，长期侍敌。蒋匪进占长春后，该犯于一九四七年一月七日经美国间谍美籍日人中村让次、麻生达夫介绍充当间谍，受“美军联络团长春分团”团长李嘉胜之领导，其间谍代号为ＴＯＡＳ＃４。同年二月曾奉李嘉胜之命随同另一蒙奸美国间谍陶克陶到郑家屯等地组织蒙奸进行破坏活动，并妄图“策反”我内蒙政府军政人员，阴谋策动内蒙政变，同年七月又奉李嘉胜命令在我解放区前郭旗、白城子、王爷庙、海拉尔等地建立情报站，该犯于“美军联络团长春分团”撤退前这一期间曾先后搜集我“内蒙王爷庙政治活动与组织情况”“王爷庙政府与军事现状”“齐齐哈尔至白城子铁路情况”“前郭旗人民政府的组织与工作情况”“哈尔滨民族代表会议情况”“王爷庙要员动态”“长春至铁岭间解放区情况”等重要情报送交“美军联络团长春分团”团长李嘉胜，一九四七年十一月，长春敌人在我军包围下岌岌可危，“美军联络分团”被迫撤离长春，迁至北平，该犯仍受李嘉胜领导，且经常派中村让次，麻生达夫检查其工作，其后由于联络中断，该犯乃于一九四八年七月十三日按原定计划来沈阳与“美军联络团沈阳分团”取得联系，又将我“内蒙人民自治政府组织变动状况及新任负责人简历”等送交该间谍机关，其后即在沈阳美军联络分团长沈乐甫及其助手西田领导下进行间谍破坏活动，同年十月二十七日沈阳解放前夕，上海美军联络团总部派密亚当（Ｍｙａｄａｍ）来沈布置潜伏工作，当将该犯召至该团授予潜伏任务并交与该犯美制Ｒ·Ｄ·Ｒ·式交流直流两用十五瓦特收发报机两部，手摇发电机一部，美制密码十本，及美金三百元，洋面十六袋，作为通报和活动经费，沈阳解放后被我市公安局侦悉，缉捕归案。
    根据上述事实和证据，被告蒙奸伯彦苍，充当美国间谍，建立间谍组织积极刺探我军政机密情报，供给美国间谍机关，并妄图策动叛乱，足以构成出卖祖国人民利益，破坏人民革命事业之间谍罪行。
    被告吴人杰（化名李嘉德）一九四六年在联合国善后救济总署沈阳办事处任英文翻译，该年十二月曾随同美国间谍巴兰森赴辽北通辽一带，以调查救济情况为名刺探我解放区情报，一九四七年十二月经美国间谍巴兰森（Ｂａｒａｎｄｓｏｎ）介绍正式充当美国间谍，受前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”内之间谍威尔斯（ｗａｌｓｈ）领导，一九四八年三月改由前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”二楼内之间谍亨特（Ｈｎｎｔ）领导，均担任沈阳与天津间情报交通工作，曾将我解放区之军政机密情报由沈阳送往天津，该犯改归亨特领导后情报均系由名唤米那米者交与该犯，如须面示机宜时则均系遵照亨特之指示，于晚间进入前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”二楼亨特处。一九四八年十月十二日，该犯由天津返沈后、由于沈阳即将解放，亨特当告以“陆上传递情报停止，改用电台联络”。十月二十八日沈阳危急，亨特乃将该犯召至前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”二楼瓦尔德办公室旁边一间房子的亨特处接头，授予潜伏任务，并给与活动经费，金块、金元宝共十个，由亨特将美制Ｒ·Ｄ·Ｒ·式交流直流两用十五瓦特收发报机两部，手摇发电机一部，美制密码五本，及纸烟一箱等用汽车送至该犯家中。沈阳解放后，该犯隐蔽于和平新村三栋三号汉中诊所。事为我市公安局侦悉，乃将该犯逮捕。
    查被告吴人杰，充当美国间谍机关之交通，负责传递情报，架设秘密电台，进行间谍破坏活动，从查获电台密码等证据，及其供认事实，足以构成其破坏祖国人民革命事业之间谍罪行。
    查被告佐佐木弘经、伯彦苍、吴人杰等经常在前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”及前驻沈阳长春美军联络分团接受关于间谍活动之指示，领取开展间谍活动之经费，提供有关中国国家秘密之情报，以上种种，足证前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”及前驻沈阳长春美军联络分团均为美帝国主义的间谍指挥与掩护机关，特别是前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”，为美军联络分团（即美国间谍机关四四海外观察组）之所在地，收容间谍头子（如西田、威尔斯、亨特等）在馆内居留，并掩护其间谍活动，实已成为危害中华人民共和国国家利益并破坏中国人民革命事业之阴谋与犯罪活动之中心，非中华人民共和国人民所能容忍。为保护中华人民共和国的国家及人民的利益计，应对该前驻沈阳“美国领事馆”全体外籍人员予以驱逐出境的处分。
    总上论结，除被告曹承德于诉讼进行中因病保外死亡，应予停止审判，和前驻沈、长“美军联络分团”已离开中华人民共和国国境暂不置议外，特予判决如主文。
