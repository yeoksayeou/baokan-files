Teaching and Learning
    Beishi Student Liu Dianjie
    A few days ago, the third-year male students in our school went to visit a primary school. During the visit to a sixth-grade history class, the teacher was lecturing on Wang Anshi's reforms in the Song Dynasty. When talking about how farmers were exploited by landlords, she said: "In the spring, farmers borrow seeds from landlords, and the interest rate is 100% per month. That is, if you borrow one dou, you have to return two dou after one month. With compound interest, it's four dou after two months and eight dou after three months..." This statement is obviously an exaggeration. The children may not have noticed it at the time, but soon they will definitely begin to doubt it, and even wonder, "Did the landlords really exploit the peasants?" Our teaching purpose was originally to enlighten the children's class consciousness, but in this way, the effect may be contrary to our purpose.
    Similarly, a few days ago, during a visit to a kindergarten, the teacher told the children about the busy farming season in autumn, but talked about harvesting wheat.
    From these two points, we cannot but say that some teachers have not studied enough. We know that some teachers were born and raised in the city and have never been to the countryside, so they don't understand the rural situation at all. Therefore, when they encounter teaching materials related to the countryside, they inevitably add some subjective imagination, and errors like the above are bound to occur. I hope some teachers pay more attention to these areas. We must strive to teach well, and also strive to learn all kinds of knowledge of production struggle and political struggle.

　　教与学
    北师学生  刘殿杰
    前几天我们学校男三年级同学去参观某小学，在参观六丁的历史课时，正讲到宋朝的王安石变法，教员讲到农民怎样被地主剥削的情形时，她说：“春天农民向地主借种子，利钱是月利率百分之百。就是借一斗一个月就得还二斗，利上加利，两个月就是四斗，三个月就是八斗……。”这种说法显然是过分夸大的。小朋友们当时也许不会觉察到，但是不久他们一定会怀疑起来，甚至于会怀疑到：“地主是不是真的剥削农民？”我们的教学目的本来是为了启发小朋友的阶级思想，但是这样一来所得到效果很可能和我们的目的相违背。
    同样在前些日子参观某校的幼稚园时，教员给小朋友讲秋天农家忙，却说到秋天收麦子。
    由这两点看来，我们不能不说有些教员们学习的不够。我们知道有些教员自小就生在城市里没有到乡间去过，对农村的情况根本不了解，所以一遇到有关农村的教材时，就不免要加上一点主观的想象，象上面那样的错误不免就要发生，希望有些教员们在这些地方多注意一下。我们要努力的教，也要努力的学习生产斗争和政治斗争的各种知识才好。
