With One Heart, We Wish Stalin Longevity!
    Jin Feng
    "Stalin is the banner of victory, Stalin is the dawn of youth! We sing joyfully to welcome victory, we follow Stalin closely!" Looking up at the huge oil painting of Stalin hanging high on the Soviet Embassy building, the young students of Beijing, the capital of the new People's Republic of China, raised a joyful song. This is the common voice of all progressive people in China and the world. With gratitude, with love, and with incomparable confidence in victory, they cheered for Stalin. Because they knew that at this very moment, in many places around the world, many people were singing with them, singing together, "Following Stalin closely!"
    On this day, the quiet Dongjiaomin Lane was filled with joyful bustle. From early morning, teams of workers, soldiers, students, and citizens, men and women, old and young, carrying flags, carrying gifts, walking, riding on decorated floats, beating gongs and drums, playing military music, dancing the yangko, happily and joyfully, passed along this road towards the Soviet Embassy. People constantly shouted, "Long live Stalin!"
    
    　　　　The Joyful Congratulatory Procession Pours into the Soviet Embassy
    Sincere hearts, enthusiasm, and red flags flowed ceaselessly into the Soviet Embassy, and soon, they came out satisfied. A large crowd of men, women, old and young from the Soviet Embassy stood there, applauding, and shouted slogans in Chinese with the congratulating Chinese brothers: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Stalin!" "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" Truly, they were like one big family! Watching all this, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Tikhvinsky said softly, "The Chinese people are liberated, and the Soviet Consulate is also liberated!" From the Northern Warlords to the Kuomintang bandit Chiang Kai-shek, reactionary rulers, ever since the founding of the Soviet Union, were deeply afraid of the Chinese people befriending the Soviet Union. They were afraid that the Chinese people would learn from the Soviet people to overthrow their reactionary rule, afraid that the socialist Soviet people would help the Chinese people overthrow their reactionary rule. Therefore, they had always placed many secret agents to monitor the Soviet Embassy and consulates. "At that time," Tikhvinsky said, "young students who wanted to come and see the books and newspapers in our attached reading room were scared away by the agents, who would put them on a blacklist!" Therefore, the people of Beijing, especially the young students, had to quicken their pace when passing the consulate gate. But how much they wanted to go in and take a look! After the liberation of Beijing, young people came to the Soviet Consulate in groups to see the people of the socialist country, to see Stalin's people, just as Chairman Mao said, "The Chinese people's respect and love for Stalin, and their friendship with the Soviet Union, are entirely sincere. Any provocation, slander, or defamation by anyone will ultimately be useless." Now, the Chinese people are freely running into the Soviet Embassy.
    People felt particularly excited about the 70th birthday of Stalin, the great teacher and leader of the world working class. Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, personally delivered gifts! Longevity peaches, longevity noodles, a porcelain statue of Stalin and the God of Longevity – these were birthday gifts in the Chinese national style that Stalin would be pleased to see. The words "May your life be as long as the Southern Mountain" were written on the God of Longevity, representing the unanimous wishes of the Chinese working class for their leader.
    The military music, filled with great joy, attracted comrades from the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal Committee. The shouts of "Long live Comrade Stalin" resounded for a long time, and the raised hands remained raised for a long time. Stalin's name had encouraged them in thousands of battles. When they were still mobilizing peasants in remote villages, when they were using homemade grenades to blow up Japanese devils' bunkers, when they were counterattacking the Kuomintang's brutal attacks, when they were leading workers and students to fight against the reactionaries in the cities, Comrade Stalin's instructions on the basic line and policy of the Chinese revolution had enabled them to break through confusion and move forward firmly. "Ura, Stalin," they shouted, in the name of the Chinese Communist Party, thanking him, in the name of the Chinese people, thanking him.
    The Central People's Public Security Corps and the Beijing General Inspection Corps entered amidst the majestic military music of the People's Liberation Army March. The Chinese people's armed forces were established under the guidance of Stalin's basic theory on the Chinese revolution. Now, they began a birthday performance, building human pyramids, forming a fortress of peace, and holding high the victorious banner of Stalin, to receive the review.
    Dozens of brightly dressed, colorful girls from the Women's Vocational School, danced joyfully, sang loudly, shining with a beautiful youthfulness. They sang happily in praise of Stalin, because they knew that Stalin was a friend of all the oppressed, Stalin helped and guaranteed that their youth would no longer be worn away in endless suffering, but would emit a more beautiful brilliance in the labor and construction to create a better life for themselves. Their youth will be eternal with labor, just as Stalin's youth will be eternal in the hearts of the working people.
    
    　　　　Follow Mao Zedong, Follow Stalin
    Now, walking in the congratulatory procession were also the famous Chinese painters Xu Beihong, Ye Qianyu, and many scientists and professors. Chinese intellectuals have learned from historical lessons and recognized their path: follow Mao Zedong, follow Stalin, and only then can the gardens of true science, culture, and art bloom with wonderful flowers. All the imperialists in the world and their running dogs can only destroy science, culture, and art.
    At this moment, joyful firecrackers rang out! These firecrackers had celebrated their own liberation, and today, they were presented as a birthday gift from the Chinese people to the great and beloved teacher and leader, Comrade Stalin, to wish him boundless longevity!

　　万众一心，祝颂斯大林！
    金凤
    “斯大林是胜利的旗帜，斯大林是青年的曙光！我们尽情欢唱着迎接胜利，我们紧紧跟着斯大林！”仰望着苏联大使馆楼上高悬的斯大林的巨幅油画像，年轻的中华人民共和国首都北京的青年学生扬起了一片欢愉的歌唱。这是全中国全世界进步人类共同的心声。怀着感激，怀着热爱，怀着无比的胜利的信心欢呼着斯大林。因为他们知道，就在这同一时候，世界上有多少地方，多少人民是在和他们一起歌唱，一起歌唱“紧紧跟着斯大林！”
    这一天，清静的东交民巷充满了欢乐的喧闹。从清早，一队队祝寿的工人、士兵、学生、市民，男的、女的、老的、小的、打着旗帜，抬着寿礼，步行的、乘着彩车的、敲着锣鼓的、奏着军乐的、扭着秧歌的、高高兴兴快快乐乐地，从这条马路上经过向着苏联大使馆前进。人们不断地喊着“万岁，斯大林！”
    　　　　欢乐的祝寿行列涌进苏联大使馆
    虔诚的心，热情和红旗川流不息地涌进苏联大使馆，不久，又尽兴的走出来。苏联大使馆的男男女女老老少少站了一大堆，鼓着掌，和祝寿的中国兄弟一起喊着中国话的口号“毛主席万岁”！“中国共产党万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”“中苏友好万岁”！真正是亲兄弟般的一家人啊！看着看着，苏联大使馆代办齐赫文斯基轻轻地说：“中国人民解放了，苏联领事馆也解放了”！反动统治者们，自北洋军阀起到国民党匪帮蒋介石止，从苏联立国的一天起，就深深怕中国人民交上了苏联朋友，他们害怕中国人民向苏联人民学习来打倒他们的反动统治，害怕社会主义苏联人民来帮助中国人民打倒他们的反动统治，因此，他们对于苏联大使馆和领事馆，从来就是放了许多特务暗探监视着的，“那时，”齐赫文斯基说：“青年学生们要想来看看我们附设的阅览室的书报，都给特务唬回去了，要把他们记上黑名单呢！”因此北京的人民特别是青年学生要想经过领事馆门口，不得不加快脚步跨过去。但是，他们是多么想进去看一看啊！北京解放以后，青年们成群结队地跑到苏联领事馆来，看一看社会主义国家的人民，看一看斯大林的人民，正如毛主席所说的“中国人民对于斯大林的敬爱，对于苏联的友谊，是完全出于诚意的。任何人的挑拨离间，造谣污蔑，到底都没有用处”。如今，中国人民是自由自在地跑进苏联大使馆来了。
    对于斯大林世界工人阶级伟大的导师和领袖的七十寿辰感到特别兴奋。全国总工会副主席李立三和北京市总工会筹委会主任肖明亲自送礼物来了！寿桃寿面，斯大林的瓷像和寿翁，这是中国民族形式的寿礼，斯大林看了会欢喜的。寿翁上面写着“寿比南山”，这是中国工人阶级对于自己领袖一致的祝颂。
    洋溢着巨大欢乐的军乐声引来了中共中央华北局和北京市委会的同志们。“斯大林同志万岁”的口号声久久不绝，举起的双手久久不放不来。斯大林的名字，曾经在千百次战斗中鼓舞了他们，当他们还在山僻小村中发动农民时，当他们拿着自制的手榴弹去炸毁日本鬼子的碉堡时，当他们反击着国民党的横暴进攻时，当他们在城市中领导着工人、学生向反动派斗争时，斯大林同志关于中国革命的基本路线和方针的指示曾经使他们打破迷茫，坚定前进，“乌拉，斯大林”，他们喊着，以中国共产党的名义喊着，感谢他，以中国人民的名义喊着，感谢他。
    中央人民公安纵队和北京纠察总队在奏着人民解放军进行曲的雄壮军乐声中进来了。中国人民的武装是在斯大林关于中国革命的基本理论指导下建立起来的。现在，他们开始了祝寿表演，垒起罗汉，构成了和平的堡垒，高扬着胜利的斯大林的旗帜，接受检阅。
    妇女职业学校几十个花团锦簇、五彩缤纷的女孩子，欢跳着、高唱着、闪耀着一片美丽的青春。她们欢跃着歌颂斯大林，因为她们知道斯大林是一切被压迫者的朋友，斯大林帮助和保证她们今后的青春不再在永无尽头的苦难中磨损过去，而将在为自己创造更美好生活的劳动建设中发出更美丽的光彩，她们的青春将随劳动而永存，正如斯大林的青春将永存在劳动人民的心中一样。
    　　　　跟着毛泽东走跟着斯大林走
    现在，走在祝寿的行列中的，还有中国的名画家徐悲鸿、叶浅予和许多科学家与教授。中国的知识分子已从历史的教训中认清了自己的道路，跟着毛泽东走，跟着斯大林走，真正的科学文化和艺术的园地才能开出奇葩。世界上一切帝国主义者和它的走狗，是只有毁灭科学文化和艺术的。
    这时，欢乐的鞭炮响起来了！这鞭炮声曾经庆祝过自己的解放，今天，则是作为中国人民的寿礼献给伟大的亲爱的导师和领袖斯大林同志的，敬祝他的万寿无疆！
