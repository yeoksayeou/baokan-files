　　Declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the China Democratic League
　　Adopted by the Fourth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the China Democratic League on December 17, 1949
　　The Fourth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the China Democratic League has concluded successfully. This meeting was convened under the new situation, namely that the Chinese People's Liberation War has achieved basic victory, the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government have been proclaimed, and the international peace and democracy camp has gained the upper hand. Just as we were holding the meeting, the Chinese People's Liberation Army marched straight in, sweeping away the last nest of the Chiang bandits on the mainland, and quickly liberated Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and other vast areas; in the international arena, with the increase of the forces of peace and democracy, the imperialist camp is even more desperate and frantic, its sinister intentions revealed, openly preparing for war, and妄想妄想把人类拖入血海深渊之中，以“挽救”其垂死的命运。 The epoch-making and brilliant victory of the Chinese people and the people of the world has put forward new demands to us—requiring us to work harder under the leadership of the Communist Party to fight for the complete victory of the revolution and national construction; requiring us to unite more closely around the Soviet Union to smash the conspiracy of the warmongers and strive for lasting world peace and people's democracy; requiring our Democratic League to embark on a new stage and a new era to shoulder new historical tasks! The great significance of the Fourth Plenary Session (Enlarged) lies in this.
　　The achievements of the meeting were great. First, we reviewed our shortcomings, summarized our experiences, accepted the lessons of the past, and especially revised the "League Constitution," defining the nature and tasks of the Democratic League: "The China Democratic League is a component of the people's democratic united front, a political alliance centered on intellectuals, especially petty-bourgeois intellectuals; its main task is to unite the vast number of intellectuals, enlightened industrialists and businessmen, and patriotic democratic elements among overseas Chinese, to move towards progress, consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, implement the Common Program, and actively participate in the various construction works of the new China, and completely accomplish the new democratic revolution." Second, "We sincerely and solemnly accept the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as the program of the China Democratic League. We accept the entire spirit and words of the Common Program. We call on all League members to unanimously support this Common Program and assume the responsibility for realizing this people's great charter" ("Resolution on Accepting the Common Program and Suspending the League Program"). Third, we sincerely accepted the leadership of the Communist Party of China. As stated in the general outline of the "League Constitution": "This League accepts the leadership of the Communist Party of China and closely cooperates with it in its work, in order to make its greatest efforts in the great cause of revolution and national construction." We deeply realize that: "The closer we are to the Communist Party, the more humbly we accept the leadership of the Communist Party, the more sound our organization will be, the more our work will be carried out, the more our influence will be expanded, and the more we will be able to shoulder our responsibilities and fulfill our mission. Therefore, we must resolutely rely on the CCP, accept the leadership of the CCP, and advance under the banner of Mao Zedong!" ("Summary of Local League Affairs"). Fourth, in this meeting, we re-elected some central committee members, strengthened the central leading organs, and were particularly pleased that some comrades from other democratic parties joined the Democratic League, expanding our organization and strengthening our strength. "We warmly welcome comrades from all democratic parties to actively participate in the Democratic League in their individual capacities, and everyone will concentrate their efforts to work for the revolution and national construction!" (Summary Report of League Affairs Discussion). Finally, and most importantly, during the meeting, Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou gave us speeches, giving us extremely valuable and important instructions, illuminating our future, guiding our work, and strengthening our confidence. After their joy and excitement, all the representatives, based on their instructions, carried out studies, reviewed their work, improved their thinking, and enhanced unity. We express our highest respect to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou!
　　The end of the meeting is a new beginning. We must implement the instructions of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, the spirit and resolutions of this meeting, into our work, in order to complete our historical tasks. We earnestly hope that the Communist Party of China will strengthen its leadership over us; we earnestly hope that people from all walks of life will give us guidance at any time! We ask all League members to further unite, study hard, forge ahead courageously, and move from victory to victory!
　　Eternal glory to the League members and all people's heroes who sacrificed for the liberation of the Chinese people!
　　Support the leadership of the Communist Party of China and strive to realize the Common Program!
　　Consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front and strive to completely realize the new democracy!
　　Strengthen and expand the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and fight for lasting peace and people's democracy!
　　Long live the People's Republic of China!
　　Long live the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

　　中国民主同盟四中全会扩大会议宣言
    一九四九年十二月十七日中国民主同盟四中全会扩大会议通过
    中国民主同盟四中全会扩大会议已经圆满闭幕了。这次会议是在新形势下召开的，即中国人民解放战争已经获得了基本的胜利，中华人民共和国和中央人民政府已经宣告成立，国际间的和平民主阵营已经取得了优势。正当我们开会的时候，中国人民解放军长驱直入，扫荡了蒋匪在大陆上的最后巢穴，迅速地解放了川、康、滇、黔、桂以及其他的广大地区；在国际间则随着和平民主力量的增涨，帝国主义阵营乃更绝望、更疯狂，图穷匕现，公开准备战争，妄想把人类拖入血海深渊之中，以“挽救”其垂死的命运。中国人民和世界人民的划时代的光辉胜利，向我们提出了新的要求——要求我们在共产党的领导之下，加倍努力，为革命建国的彻底胜利而斗争；要求我们更加紧密地团结在苏联的周围，为粉碎战争贩子的阴谋、争取世界的持久和平与人民民主而斗争；要求我们民主同盟必须走上一个新阶段、新纪元，以担负起来新的历史任务！四中全会扩大会议的伟大意义，正在于此。
    会议的成就是很大的。第一，我们检讨了缺点，总结了经验，接受了过去的教训，特别是修改了“盟章”，确定了民盟的性质和任务：“中国民主同盟是人民民主统一战线中的一个组成部分，是一个以知识分子、特别是小资产阶级知识分子为中心的政治联盟；它的主要任务就是团结广大的知识分子、开明的工商业者和华侨中的爱国民主分子，走向进步，巩固并扩大人民民主统一战线，实现共同纲领，积极参加新中国的各项建设工作，彻底完成新民主主义革命”。第二，“我们热诚地，郑重地接受中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领为中国民主同盟的纲领。我们接受共同纲领的全部精神和文字。我们号召全体盟员一致拥护这个共同纲领并担负实现这个人民大宪章的责任”（“关于接受共同纲领及停止民盟纲领的决议”）。第三，我们诚恳地接受了中国共产党的领导。正如“盟章”总纲中所说：“本盟接受中国共产党的领导，与之密切配合工作，以期在革命建国的伟大事业中尽其最大的努力”。我们深深地体会到：“我们越靠近共产党，越能虚心接受共产党的领导，我们的组织就越能健全，我们的工作就越能开展，我们的影响就越能扩大，我们就越能担负起来我们的责任，完成我们的使命。因此，我们要坚决地依靠中共，接受中共的领导，在毛泽东的旗帜下前进！”（“地方盟务总结”）。第四，在这次会议中，我们补选了一部分中央委员，加强了中央领导机构，特别欣幸的，就是其他民主党派中有些同志加入了民盟，使我们扩大了组织，增强了力量。“我们热烈欢迎各民主党派的同志们，以个人资格踊跃参加民盟，大家集中力量，为革命建国而努力！”（盟务研讨总结报告）。最后，也是最重要的，就是在会议进行中，毛主席和周总理曾向我们讲话，予我们以极宝贵、极重要的指示，照明了我们的前途，指导了我们的工作，加强了我们的信心。全体代表们在欢欣鼓舞之余，曾根据他们的指示，进行了学习，检讨了工作，提高了思想，增进了团结。我们谨向毛主席和周总理表示崇高的敬意！
    会议的结束乃是一个新的开始。我们一定要把毛主席和周总理的指示，把这次会议的精神和决议，贯彻到工作里去，以完成我们的历史任务。我们恳切希望中国共产党要对我们加强领导；我们恳切希望各界人民要对我们随时指教！我们要求全体盟员进一步地团结起来，努力学习，奋勇前进，从胜利走向胜利！
    为中国人民解放而牺牲的盟员们和一切人民英雄们永垂不朽！
    拥护中国共产党的领导，为实现共同纲领而奋斗！
    巩固并扩大人民民主统一战线，为彻底实现新民主主义而奋斗！
    加强并扩大以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，为持久的和平与人民的民主而斗争！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
