Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th: The following is a summary of the speech given by Mr. Vermersch, representative of the French Friendship Delegation, a guest attending the Asian Women's Representative Conference, at the conference on the morning of December 12th:

　　The French people are struggling against domestic imperialism, Anglo-American imperialism, and the dark forces of the Vatican. In our country, there are also bandits like the Chinese Kuomintang gang, such as De Gaulle, Blum, Bidault, Schuman, and Moch. Their treasonous acts are exactly the same as those of Chiang Kai-shek.

　　Because the Soviet army achieved victory over Hitler's Germany, the anti-enemy movement in France during the war was able to develop, and the democratic movement continued to expand after the war. Moreover, because of the strong national independence movement in Vietnam, French imperialism had to recognize the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. However, the French imperialists were unwilling to lose their position in Vietnam and once again launched a war of massacre against the Vietnamese people. The French people understand that attacking the Vietnamese people is an unjust crime, and they also know that this war of massacre brings only poverty and persecution to our people. Therefore, the French people oppose the Vietnam War, not only as an expression of solidarity with Vietnam but also as a struggle for our own rights and interests.

　　To oppose the Vietnam War, many demonstrations have been held in various parts of France. In the peace referendum we held on October 2nd this year, more than seven million men and women unanimously opposed the Vietnam War. In the National Assembly, the Communist Party parliamentary group—which includes many women—sternly exposed the crimes of the colonialists. Women's organizations, especially the French Women's Union, have printed many publications, slogans, leaflets, and daily newspapers to condemn the crimes of the Vietnam War and to call for anti-war actions. Many women in our local committees have been legally punished for this action.

　　We started with actions in the National Assembly, followed by propaganda, and now we are beginning to fight the Vietnam War with practical and effective struggles. At the call of the French Women's Union, parades and demonstrations have been held throughout France. To oppose the shipment of weapons to Vietnam, strikes have been held in Dunkirk and Marseille. Mothers whose children were killed in the war or whose sons were left in Vietnam and unable to return have held demonstrations in front of the Ministry of the Army in Paris. In Paris, young soldiers were imprisoned for refusing to go to Vietnam.

　　The French people are also engaged in another struggle against the anti-French imperialist reactionary government. French women have written on their banners: "French mothers will never send their children to fight the Soviet Union." The struggle of the French people is to free France from the rule of imperialism, especially American imperialism, and to oppose the conspiracy to prepare for a third world war. This war is being waged by imperialists against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. We also oppose oppression in North Africa, West Africa, and Madagascar. In these places, especially in Madagascar, the French government has terroristically massacred as many as 80,000 people.

　　The struggle for independence in the Asian colonies and semi-colonies has been combined with the struggle of the people in the imperialist countries to confront the common enemy of all nations. As for us women, we have firmly stated at the Budapest conference that we will strengthen our struggle against our own country's imperialism. We have written this aspiration on a flag, and today we will send it to our Vietnamese sisters. We firmly believe that with the Soviet Union, the vanguard of liberation in Asia and the world, and with Mongolia and China, other countries in Asia will be able to be completely liberated from the hands of imperialism. We also firmly believe that the people in the imperialist countries, united under the leadership of the working class, can defeat the reactionary forces.

### 法国友谊代表团代表魏尔密士发言

　　法国友谊代表团代表魏尔密士发言
    【新华社北京十三日电】参加亚洲妇女代表会议的来宾法国友谊代表团代表魏尔密士于十二日上午在亚洲妇女代表会议上发言摘要如下：
    法国人民正在向本国帝国主义、英美帝国主义以及梵蒂冈的黑暗势力作斗争。在我们国内也有和中国国民党匪帮一样的强盗，比如戴高乐、勃鲁姆、皮杜尔、舒曼、莫克，他们的叛国行为，是完全和蒋介石一样的。
    因为苏联军队对希特勒德国取得了胜利，使得法国在大战时期抗敌运动能够开展，大战以后民主运动继续扩大；又因为越南强大的民族独立运动，使法帝国主义不得不承认越南民主共和国。但法帝国主义者又不甘心失掉在越南的地位，就又向越南人民再次进行屠杀战争。法国人民了解，向越南人民进攻是一种不正义的罪行，也知道这种屠杀战争给我们人民带来的只有贫困与迫害。所以法国人民反对越南战争，不但是对越南团结的表现，同时也是为我们自己的权益而斗争。
    为了反对越南战争，在法国各地举行过很多次示威运动。今年十月二日我们举行的和平测验，七百多万男女一致反对越南战争；在国会中，共产党议员集团——其间包括很多的妇女，他们严厉地揭发殖民者罪行；妇女团体方面，特别是法国妇女联合会，曾经印行了很多印刷品、标语、传单、日报，来谴责越南战争的罪行，来号召反战的行动。我们各地委员会中的许多妇女，为了这一行动，受到法律的处分。
    我们先从国会的行动作起，继之是宣传，现在我们是开始以实际有效的斗争来反对越南战争了。由于法国妇女联合会的号召，法国各地都举行了游行示威。为了反对军火运赴越南，在敦克尔克，在马赛都曾先后举行罢工。还有那些被战争杀害了孩子的母亲或者儿子留在越南不得回家的母亲，都曾在巴黎陆军部前举行过示威。在巴黎，青年的士兵因为拒绝开往越南，被关进监牢。
    法国人民也正在进行着另一种反法帝国主义反动政府的斗争。法国妇女在她们的旗帜上写着：“法国的母亲永远不会把她的孩子送去和苏联作战”。法国人民的斗争是为了使法国不受帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义的统治；是为了反对准备第三次世界大战阴谋。因为这次战争是帝国主义者向苏联及人民民主国家进行的。我们也反对向北非、西非、马达加斯加进行压迫。在这几个地方，特别马达加斯加一地，法国政府就恐怖地屠杀了八万人之多。
    亚洲各殖民地半殖民地独立的斗争，已经和帝国主义国家内人民的斗争结合在一起，对抗各民族共同的敌人。拿我们妇女来说，我们已在布达佩斯的会议上，坚决表示要加强我们的斗争来反对本国帝国主义。我们把这个志愿写在一面旗帜上，今天就送给我们越南的姊妹。我们坚信有了亚洲和全世界解放的先驱苏联，有了蒙古、中国之后，亚洲其他各国是可能从帝国主义手中全部解放出来的。我们也坚信，在帝国主义国家的人民，团结在工人阶级领导下，是可以战胜反动势力的。
