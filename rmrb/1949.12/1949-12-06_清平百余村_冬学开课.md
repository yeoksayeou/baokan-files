　　Qingping Over a Hundred Villages
  　Winter School Begins
    [Pingyuan News] In Qingping County, Pingyuan Province, winter schools have started in 148 villages, with an enrollment of 12,088 students, including 7,560 males and 4,528 females. The winter school movement is now expanding from key villages to general villages. Since the adoption of the resolution on the winter school plan at the county party representative meeting, the party representatives of each district have conducted research and deployment based on the different requirements and awareness of the masses in each district. In the process of mobilization, the leadership method of penetrating key points, creating experience, and promoting the general was adopted first. Secondly, it is necessary to open up the thinking of party members, make them realize the importance of winter school, and clarify that winter school is a school for educating the masses to engage in production, and at the same time, go deep into the masses to mobilize and persuade them to voluntarily participate in winter school. At the same time, the problem of teachers was specifically resolved, short-term training courses for winter school teachers were held, coupled with the core leadership and promotion of branch party members and village cadres, so winter schools in many villages were quickly established. In Cuilou, a key village in the fourth district, party members, village cadres, and winter school teachers first mobilized their families to attend winter school, using this practical action to influence and educate the masses to also participate in winter school voluntarily. The cadres of Yangzhuang mobilized their wives and daughters-in-law to attend winter school first. Under their leadership and organization, 57 women have signed up to enter winter school.
    Now, except for the second district, which is a cotton-producing area where the masses are busy cutting cotton stalks and winter school has not yet officially started, other districts in the county have basically broken through the key points and are developing in an all-round way.

　　清平百余村
  　冬学开课
    【平原讯】平原省清平县已有一百四十八个村的冬学开学，入学人数达一万二千零八十八人，其中男七千五百六十人，女四千五百二十八人。现冬学运动正由重点村向一般村全面展开中。自从在本县党代表会议上对冬学计划作出决议后，各区党代表回去，均根据各区群众不同的要求和觉悟，进行了研究和布置。在发动过程中，首先采取深入重点，创造经验，推动一般的领导办法。其次要打通党员思想，使之认识到冬学的重要，明确冬学是教育群众进行生产的学校，并在同时深入群众动员说服，以达到其自愿参加冬学。同时又具体解决了师资问题，召开冬学教员短期训练，再加上支部党员村干的核心领导与推动，于是不少村庄的冬学很快就办起来。四区崔楼重点村，党员，村干，冬学教员等，先动员了自己家里人上冬学，以此实际行动，影响教育了群众也自动参加了冬学。杨庄的干部动员自己的妻子、儿媳首先上冬学，在她们的带头和组织下，有五十七名妇女已报名入了冬学。
    现在全县除二区是棉产区群众忙于砍花柴冬学尚未正式开学外，其他各区已基本上突破了重点，正向全面发展着。
