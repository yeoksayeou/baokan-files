Approximately 40,000 people from over 300 units, including factories, government offices, military units, schools, and organizations, attended. The flags of the 31 countries whose representatives participated in the Asian Women's Conference were hung high on the white stone railings in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony. On the rostrum, between the towering portraits of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin, was the emblem of the Asian Women's Representative Conference, symbolizing peace and freedom.

The大会 [Conference] began with the national anthem of the People's Republic of China and the Internationale. Cai Chang, Nie Rongzhen, Li Lisan, Feng Wenbin, Zhang Xiaomei, Xiao Ming, Chai Zemin, Xu Deheng, Qian Duansheng, and twelve others, along with Madam Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation and head of the Presidium of the Asian Women's Conference, and thirteen others, were elected to the Presidium of the大会 [Conference].

They must mobilize all the women of Asia and the women of the world to stop this war."

Among the guests, Madam Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation, spoke first. She pointed out that the peace camp has no geographical boundaries.
