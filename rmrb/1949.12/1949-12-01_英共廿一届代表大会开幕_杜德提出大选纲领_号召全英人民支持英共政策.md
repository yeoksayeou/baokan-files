Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 30th: According to TASS, Liverpool: The 21st Congress of the British Communist Party opened here on November 28th. British Communist Party Vice-Chairman Pollitt delivered a speech at the meeting, presenting the party's election program "Britain's Road to Socialism" for discussion at the Congress.

Pollitt emphasized that the programs of both the Conservative and Labour parties cannot solve the problems faced by the British people, and the only program that can solve these problems is the Communist Party's program. This program points out the only positive way to solve the British crisis. The purpose of this program is: Britain's national independence, economic recovery, prosperity, improved living standards, and peace.

After outlining the program, Pollitt, on behalf of the leadership of the British Communist Party, called on "all people in the labor movement and all progressive people who are troubled by the existing austerity policies, deteriorating living conditions, and war movements to support this program."

Moffat, Chairman of the Scottish Branch of the National Union of Mineworkers, proposed a motion condemning the Tito group as agents of Anglo-American imperialism, which was unanimously passed by the Congress. The work of the Congress is continuing.
