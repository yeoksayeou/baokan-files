Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: The personnel of the Dimitrov Shipyard, the Bozhinov Factory, the "Volcano" Factory, and other industrial enterprises in Varna, Bulgaria, held gatherings to request that the Varna City Council rename Varna as Stalin City, as a symbol of the Bulgarian workers' heartfelt, boundless love and admiration for Comrade Stalin, the best friend of the Bulgarian people. The celebratory meeting of the Varna City Council unanimously passed a resolution, amidst thunderous applause and shouts of "Stalin! Stalin! Stalin!", requesting the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly to rename Varna as Stalin City.

The achievements of the socialist emulation initiated by the Bulgarian working people to celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday are now being summarized. In industry, metalworkers are in the lead. The employees of forty metal manufacturing enterprises were the first to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule. They decided to produce consumer goods worth tens of millions of leva before the end of the year. Workers in cement factories are already producing for next year's plan. Socialist emulation is also widespread in agriculture. The autumn sowing plan has been successfully completed. The deep ploughing and meticulous cultivation plan is nearing completion. Two state farms located in Dobruja have planted protective forest belts for the first time. Forty farms are adopting pasture crop rotation this year. People engaged in developing agriculture have also actively participated in the nationwide socialist emulation. Fifty-three state farms will be organized before the end of the year.

　　保加利亚人民欢腾祝寿
  　社会主义竞赛遍全国
  　发那城将改名斯大林城
    【新华社北京十九日电】塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚发那城的季米特洛夫造船厂、波吉夫工厂、“火山”工厂及发那的其他工业企业的人员们曾举行集会，要求发那市议会将发那城改名为斯大林城，作为保加利亚工人对这位保加利亚人民最好的朋友斯大林同志表示衷心的无限爱戴和敬仰的象征。发那市议会的庆祝会议在雷动的掌声和“斯大林！斯大林！斯大林！”的欢呼声中一致通过决议，要求保加利亚国民议会主席团将发那城改名为斯大林城。
    保加利亚劳动人民所发起的为庆祝斯大林七十寿辰的社会主义竞赛成绩，现正加以总结。工业中以金属工人居于首位。四十个金属制造企业的员工，最先提前完成本年生产计划。他们决定在年底以前生产价值数千万利瓦的消费品。水泥工厂的工人，已在为明年的计划进行生产了。社会主义竞赛也广布于农业中。秋季播种计划已胜利地完成。深耕细作的计划接近完成。位于多布鲁查的两个国营农场，已首次植下防护林带。四十个农场今年正在采行牧草作物轮种制。从事于发展农业的人民，亦已积极参加遍于全国的社会主义竞赛。在年底以前将组织五十三个国营农场。
