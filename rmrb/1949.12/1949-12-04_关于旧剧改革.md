On the Reform of Old Operas
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Luo Qing
Comrade ××:
I have been in Beijing for more than a month, and I have had the chance to see Peking Opera three times, including two performances by the famous artist Cheng Yanqiu, "The Story of the Embroidered Purse" and "Tears in the Wilderness." His Peking Opera, in terms of classical artistic cultivation, or, more precisely, in terms of the technical cultivation and certain creativity of this classical opera, is commendable and worthy of cherishing—of course, not without room for discussion. However, the content of the play, especially in terms of its ideology, has left me deeply touched and distressed!

For example, the entire content and plot of "The Story of the Embroidered Purse" thoroughly promotes the so-called "benevolence" and "virtuous governance" of landlords, bureaucrats, and usurers, praising almsgiving and unearned income. What is its historical value? What good is it today?

The content and plot of "Tears in the Wilderness" are generally considered good because it exposes the darkness of a certain feudal rule in the Ming Dynasty and depicts the suffering of the people. Such historical excavation and playwriting are beneficial to the people and worthy of promotion and encouragement. However, there are also aspects that require deep deliberation, such as the segment of the "kuai sanyan" aria: "I don't blame the yamen runners for carrying out orders, I don't blame the county magistrate for extorting taxes, I don't blame Yang Sichang... I only blame being born into a chaotic world." Such thinking may have existed in some historical figures, but today, will it obscure the class consciousness of revolutionary and working people? Although it is only a segment of an aria, and even if efforts are focused on the singing technique, making the lyrics difficult to hear clearly, it greatly damages the content and meaning of the play.

It has been so long since Beijing's liberation, and it is the stronghold of Peking Opera. Peking Opera occupies such a broad position in the entertainment life and social education of people in a considerable area of China. I believe that the agencies, organizations, and many people who care for and love this highly developed classical drama with a rich and profound national artistic tradition, have spent a lot of valuable effort in researching, critiquing, transforming, and seeking to preserve and promote its advantages while abandoning and overcoming its shortcomings over a period of time. However, these signs of Peking Opera reform are still insufficient, at least for the time being.

Cheng Yanqiu is a glorious representative of the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Like Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, and others, he was originally an excellent and progressive figure in the Peking Opera circle. Today, they are all older, but they still adhere to their principles and continue to dedicate themselves to the stage, which is commendable. However, if they want to serve the people with Peking Opera in the future, they must reform these plays to meet the demands of the broad masses of the people, especially the working people. They must help Peking Opera to turn over a new leaf. Peking Opera is an artistic form in which Chinese classical drama has achieved its highest development. It was originally created by the broad masses of the people in history, but it has become a tool for the ruling class in history to glorify themselves and fool the people. Today, to turn it over means to restore the historical people reflected in it to their original appearance and position in history, and to make it an artistic means of expressing the struggles of the people in history.

I remember that back in the spring of 1944, when the Yan'an Ping Opera Troupe and some comrades who loved Peking Opera, such as Yang Shaoxuan, Qi Yanming, A Jia, Ren Guilin, and Wei Jinsheng, under the call and encouragement of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, produced the first new-style Peking Opera "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels," Chairman Mao specifically instructed: "History is created by the people, but on the old opera stage (in all old literature and old art that is far from the people), the people have become dregs, and the stage is ruled by masters, mistresses, and young ladies. This reversal of history is now reversed by you, restoring its original appearance. From now on, the old opera has opened a new chapter... I hope you will write and perform more, forming a trend and promoting it throughout the country." What a significant and glorious task this is!

The Yan'an Ping Opera Troupe and Peking Opera enthusiasts in some old liberated areas followed Chairman Mao's instructions and continued to make some attempts to adapt and create new Peking Operas, taking "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels" as an example. Plays such as "Three Attacks on the Zhu Family Village," "The Red Turban Rebellion," "Daming Prefecture," and "Li Zicheng Enters Beijing" are all good examples. However, "The Story of the Embroidered Purse," which is performed in the capital today, does not fully conform to this new direction. The material of "Tears in the Wilderness" is more in line with this direction, but unfortunately, the lyrics and other aspects that express the content still have many aspects worth studying and correcting, and it cannot be called a completely new-style Peking Opera. As for the entire stage in Beijing, it goes without saying that it is almost entirely ruled by masters, mistresses, and young ladies. Everything is still the old false historical face, and the true face of history has not yet been restored. The people in history have not yet turned over on today's stage. I believe that outstanding figures in the Peking Opera circle, such as Mei, Zhou, and Cheng, will not ignore such a situation, nor will they tolerate it.

I believe that the glorious task of Mei, Zhou, and Cheng in the future mainly lies not in personally performing operas, but in participating in the reform of Peking Opera under the leadership of the People's Government. This reform work includes four aspects: reforming the script (revising old scripts and creating new scripts), innovating acting skills, promoting colleagues, and cultivating a new generation. The main tasks of Mei, Zhou, and Cheng in these areas should focus on innovating acting skills and promoting colleagues. Reforming and creating scripts is the biggest and prerequisite task, which requires correct ideological guidance. Cultivating a new generation can only begin when the first three tasks have achieved a certain degree of success and results. That is to say, after Peking Opera is reformed, the good results and experiences will continue to be promoted and disseminated, and new actors will be trained to moderately preserve this national classical art. In the process of reforming Peking Opera, Mei, Zhou, and Cheng must first and foremost pay attention to hard work at all times, reform their old views and old styles in art and technology, and become new views and new styles that conform to Mao Zedong Thought, so as to set an example.

The issue of Peking Opera reform is quite complex, and I am a layman, so I dare not talk casually. I am only expressing my feelings after seeing the current situation. Really, when can the old reform "form a trend and be promoted throughout the country"? Although I know that cultural revolution, the revolution of ideology, is often more long-term and arduous than economic and political revolution, I always hope to shorten the process as much as possible by using the existing conditions. While I am anxious, I am also very confident that as long as the capital of the People's Republic inherits the tradition of Yan'an and makes a start, our hopes can be realized more quickly.

October 16th in Beijing.

　　关于旧剧改革
    罗青
    ××同志：
    我来京一个多月，在极偶然的机会下，曾看过三次京剧，其中两次是著名艺员程艳秋的“锁麟囊”和“荒山泪”。他主演的京剧，在古典艺术的修养上，不，更确当的说，在这种古典剧的技巧修养和某些创造性上，是很可赞赏，值得珍贵的，——当然并不是就没有商榷余地了。但是，在剧的内容，尤其是思想上，则使我感触特深而陷于苦闷！
    比方，“锁麟囊”一剧，整个内容、剧情，澈头澈尾是替地主、官僚、高利贷者的所谓“仁慈”与“德政”宣传的，歌颂恩赐，歌颂不劳而获，这在历史上有什么价值呢？这在今天有什么好处呢？
    “荒山泪”一剧的内容和情节，一般说是好的，因为它暴露了明代某一封建统治的黑暗，描写了人民的疾苦。象这样的历史的发掘和剧本的编演，对人民是有益的，值得发扬和提倡。然而，也还有很须深刻推敲之处，如有一段快三眼唱词：“我不怪公役奉行命令，我不怪县太爷暴敛横片，我不怪杨嗣昌……但怪生做了乱世之民”。这种思想，在历史上某种人物，可能有的，但在今天，是否会模糊革命的和劳动人民的阶级意识呢？虽然仅仅是一段唱词，甚至由于着重在唱的技巧上做功夫，词句不易听清，可是，它使这一部剧的内容和意义，受到了很大的损害。
    北京解放这么久，又是京剧的大本营，京剧在中国相当广大的地区人民的文娱生活和社会教育上，占着如此宽阔的地位。我相信，掌管指导这一部门的机关、组织以及许多关心爱好这一具有丰富深厚的民族艺术传统而高度发展了的古典剧的人们，若干时间以来，在研究、批判、改造、求得其优点的保存与发扬，缺点的扬弃克服上，定已费了不少宝贵的心力，但是，这种京剧的革新的迹象，至少在目前还是很不够。
    程艳秋是光荣的人民政协第一届的代表，他和梅兰芳、周信芳等人一样，原都是京剧界优秀而又力求进步的人物，今天，年事都较高，而仍坚守原则岗位，继续献身舞台，这是应当钦佩的。但是，他们今后要拿京剧为人民服务，假如不把这些剧本加以改革，就不能满足广大人民，特别是劳动人民的要求了。他们必须帮助京剧翻身，京剧是中国古典戏剧得到最高的发展的一种艺术形式，它原本是历史上的广大人民所创造的，但却变成了历史上的统治阶级歌颂自己而愚弄人民的工具，今天使它翻身，就是使反映在它里面的历史上的人民，取得历史上的本来面目和地位，要使它成为表现历史上人民的斗争生活的艺术手段。
    我记得，还在一九四四年的春天，当延安的平剧院和一些爱好京剧的同志如杨少萱、齐燕铭、阿甲、任桂林、魏金生等，在毛主席和党中央的号召鼓励下，编演出第一部新型京剧“逼上梁山”的时候，毛主席就曾特别指示过：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧剧舞台上（在一切旧的离开人民的旧文艺旧艺术上），人民都变成了渣滓，由老爷、太太、小姐统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们又颠倒过来，恢复了本来面目，从此旧剧开了新生面。……你们这个开端，将是旧剧革命的划时代的开端……希望你们多编多演，蔚成风气，推行全国”。这是何等重大而光荣的工作呢！
    延安的平剧院和各老解放区的部分的京剧爱好者，曾遵循毛主席这个指示，并以“逼山梁山”一剧为榜样，继续做过一些关于改编与创作演出新京剧的尝试，如“三打祝家庄”、“红巾起义”、“大名府”、“闯王进京”等剧，都是较好的范例。可是，今天在人民首都演出的“锁麒囊”，则是不完全符合这一新的方向，“荒山泪”的取材，比较符合这个方向，可惜表达内容的唱词和其他方面还有很多值得研究改正之处，还不能称得是完全的新型京剧。至于整个北京市舞台，更不待说，则几乎还整个的为老爷、太太、小姐统治着，一切还是旧的假历史的面目，还没有恢复历史的真面目，历史上的人民，还没有在今天的舞台上翻身，这样的情况，我想京剧界的优秀分子如梅、周、程诸君，决不会忽视，也决不能容忍下去的。
    梅、周、程诸人今后的光荣任务，我以为，主要的还不在于亲自演剧，应在人民政府的领导之下，把主要精力，放在参加京剧的改造工作上。这种改造工作，包括改造剧本（修改旧剧本与创作新剧本），革新演技，推动同行，培养新代等四方面，而梅、周、程诸人在这些方面的主要任务，则以革新演技与推动同行为重点。改造和创作剧本，则是一个最大的和先决的任务，这更要依靠正确的思想指导，培养新代，则须在前三项工作做到一定程度和成绩时，才可以开始。这就是说，京剧经过改造以后，把好的成果和经验，继续发扬传播，培养出新的演员，以适度的保存这一民族的古典艺术。而梅、周、程诸人，在这个改造京剧的工作和过程中，必须首先的，时时刻刻的注意下苦工，改造自己的艺术、技术上的旧观点和旧风格，成为符合毛主席思想的新观点新风格，以资表率。
    关于京剧改造的问题，颇不简单而我又是一个门外汉，更不敢随便谈。我只是看到目前的情况，不胜感触，所以向你反映一点观感。真的，旧的改造，何时才能“蔚成风气，推行全国”呢？我虽然知道，文化革命，意识形态的革命，往往比经济的政治的革命，更带有长期性艰苦性，但我总希望能利用现有条件，尽可能的缩短其过程。我一面感到着急，一面也很具信心，只要人民共和国的首都，继承延安的传统，作一个开端，我们的希望是可以较快的实现的。
