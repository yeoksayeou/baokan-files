Gift-Bearing Processions from All Over Heading Towards Paris

The most moving event in France's preparations to celebrate Stalin's seventieth birthday is the spontaneous and genuine mass movement of individuals giving gifts to Stalin, which is developing throughout the country. This movement is taking place in every town and village. The Communist group in Menton is preparing to send Stalin a symbolic gift. During the war, a group of Soviet combatants escaped from the clutches of the Hitlerite bandits and hid in the home of a female Communist in this town. These Soviet soldiers later joined the French guerrillas and fought against the Hitlerite bandits. When they left the woman who had helped them, they left behind a portrait of Stalin painted on cloth as a memento. At parting, they told her: "Keep it well. Remember: Stalin will save France and all of Europe from fascism." Now, the Communists of Menton will send this portrait painted by Soviet soldiers during the difficult days of the occupation—symbolizing the indestructible friendship and brotherhood between the people of France and the Soviet Union in the anti-fascist struggle—to Comrade Stalin. The miners of Billy-Montigny will send Stalin their lamps, inscribed with the words: "Dear Comrade Stalin: In commemoration of your seventieth birthday, the miners of Billy-Montigny vow never to allow an attack on the Soviet people." The gift from the French Union of Young Women of the 2nd arrondissement of Paris to Stalin is a banner embroidered with the slogan that inspires French youth: "The country of Danielle Casanova (referring to a female hero of the French Resistance who was murdered by the Nazi army) will never fight against the country of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya (referring to a famous Soviet female partisan who was murdered by the Nazi army)."

The gifts for Stalin will be exhibited in a large hall in Paris starting on December 6th. The processions carrying the gifts are now heading towards Paris from all over France. They have left Marseille, Lille, Strasbourg, Saint-Étienne, and their respective cities. The processions stop from time to time along the way to hold meetings and receive new gifts. The gratitude of the French working people to the great organizer and inspirer of the struggle for peace and friendship between nations is vividly expressed here, which is of great political significance.

The French people have shown in these days their firm determination to support the cause of peace and to maintain and consolidate their friendship with the Soviet Union, regardless of all the conspiracies of the warmongers. They are full of confidence in the victory of the democratic camp fighting for peace, because they see Stalin standing at the head of this camp, whose name is the banner of unconquerable tenacity in the struggle.

　　各地送礼行列正向巴黎前进
    法国在庆祝斯大林七十诞辰的准备中最感动人的事件，是在全国各地发展中的各别给斯大林送礼的自发和真正的群众运动。这一运动正在每一个市镇和乡村开展中。蒙顿地方的共产党小组准备送给斯大林一件象征性的礼物。在战争中，曾有一群苏联的战斗人员自希特勒匪帮的拘禁中逃出来，躲藏在这个镇上一位女共产党员的家中。这些苏联士兵后来参加了法国游击队，并进行反希特勒匪帮的斗争。他们在离开这位曾帮助他们的妇女时，留下了一幅画在布上的斯大林像作为纪念。在离别时，他们告诉她；“好好地保藏着它吧。记着：斯大林将自法西斯主义之下拯救出法国和整个欧洲。”现在，蒙顿的共产党将把这幅苏联士兵在占领时期的艰苦日子内绘的画像——象征着法苏两国人民在反法西斯斗争中不可摧毁的友谊和兄弟情谊——送给斯大林同志。比利蒙蒂格尼的矿工将把他们用的灯送给斯大林，灯上刻着：“亲爱的斯大林同志：为了纪念你的七十诞辰，比利蒙蒂格尼的矿工宣誓永远不允许发动对苏联人民的攻击。”巴黎第二区的法国女青年联盟送给斯大林的礼物，是一面锦旗，上面绣着鼓舞法国青年的口号：“但尼尔和卡诺瓦（按系被纳粹军队杀害的法国抵抗运动的女英雄）的国家，永远不会对丹娘（按系被纳粹军队杀害的苏联著名女游击队员）的国家作战”。
    送给斯大林的礼物，将于十二月六日开始在巴黎的一个大厅内举行展览。携带着礼物的队伍，现在正自全法国各地向巴黎前进中。他们已离开了马赛、里尔、斯特拉斯堡、圣德田和他们各自的城市。队伍的行列不时在路途上逗留下来，举行会议，并收受新的礼物。法国劳动人民对争取和平和各国间的友谊的伟大组织者和鼓舞者的感激，在这里极生动地表现了出来，这是具有极大政治意义的。
    法国人民在这些日子里显示了：他们不顾战争贩子的一切阴谋，而支持和平事业和保持并巩固他们与苏联的友谊的坚定决心。他们对于为和平而斗争的民主阵营的胜利，充满信心，因为他们看到了斯大林站在这个阵营的前头，他的名字就是斗争中不可征服的顽强的标帜。
