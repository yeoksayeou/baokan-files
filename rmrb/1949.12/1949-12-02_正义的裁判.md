　　A Just Verdict
    Following the Wald assault case involving an American national, the American espionage case in Northeast China has also been concluded by the Shenyang Municipal People's Court. The criminals Sasaki and others have been sentenced to imprisonment, and all foreign personnel of the former U.S. Consulate in Shenyang, who directed and shielded the espionage activities, have been expelled from Chinese territory. This is a just verdict, declaring the dignity of the laws of the People's Republic of China, the inviolability of its sovereignty, and the unacceptability of insulting its people.
    The trial of this espionage case once again exposes the insidious, ferocious, and unscrupulous nature of American imperialism, which is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. It turns out that the former U.S. Consulate in Shenyang was a center for espionage activities. Those so-called "diplomatic personnel" sent to Northeast China by Washington had no legitimate business; they were only secretly engaged in those shameful and villainous activities. They bought off remnants of Japanese fascists and Mongolian and Han traitors, established a vast espionage organization, set up eleven intelligence strongholds, and spied on our military and political intelligence, undermining our People's Liberation Area and the people's revolutionary cause. Even after the Kuomintang bandit troops in the Northeast had been completely wiped out, the American imperialist elements in Shenyang not only did not give up but instead arranged for subversive activities, attempting to penetrate Inner Mongolia, instigate rebellion, and subvert our People's Government; they also openly gathered crowds to beat our workers and acted violently. Our People's Government absolutely cannot allow imperialist elements and their servants to run wild and act unlawfully within Chinese territory, plotting wrongdoing. Therefore, after the criminal conspiracy of this group of criminals was discovered, they quickly fell into the legal net and suffered the punishment they deserved.
    The judgments of the Shenyang Municipal People's Court in the two cases uphold the justice and authority of the Chinese people and give a deserved lesson to those imperialists who dare to endanger our people's motherland and infringe upon our people's rights. It is absolutely impermissible for diplomatic personnel of any country stationed in any country to engage in espionage activities, and it is also a violation of criminal law to beat the people of the host country. The so-called "diplomatic personnel" sent by the U.S. government to the Kuomintang reactionary government were originally just ordinary僑民 (overseas Chinese) on the territory of the People's Republic of China, which had no diplomatic relations with the U.S. government. Now, they are using the signboard of the so-called "Consulate" to engage in espionage activities and gather crowds to commit violence, completely losing even the qualifications of ordinary僑民 (overseas Chinese). Our People's Government, in exercising national sovereignty, will bring to justice the criminals who directly engaged in criminal acts and expel all foreign personnel of the former U.S. Consulate in Shenyang who directed and shielded the criminal activities to eliminate the source of this evil, which is something that should be done and must be done. When the criminal Wald was arrested, the American imperialist government clamored loudly. Now, the Shenyang Municipal People's Court has not only convicted Wald but also subsequently pronounced the verdict in the American espionage case and made public the indictments and judgments of both cases. The crimes of Wald, Stuart, and their ilk have been exposed to the world, and the American government has nothing more to quibble about. It must be understood that the Chinese People's Government is the people's own strong government, and it has the determination and strength to defend the country's independence, freedom, and territorial integrity, to protect the people's revolutionary achievements and all legitimate rights and interests, and will never allow foreign imperialism to invade our sovereignty, interfere in our internal affairs, and oppress our people. The era in which imperialists ran wild and acted unlawfully on Chinese territory is gone forever, and the era in which imperialists relied on blackmail and intimidation to deceive the Chinese people is gone forever.

### 正义的裁判

　　正义的裁判
    继美侨瓦尔德行凶案之后，东北的美间谍案，也已由沈阳市人民法院审结判决，罪犯佐佐木等分别被处徒刑，指挥和掩护间谍活动的美前驻沈阳领事馆的全体外籍人员被驱逐出中国国境。这是正义的裁判，它宣告了中华人民共和国法律的尊严，主权的不可侵犯，和人民的不可侮辱。
    这一间谍案的审判，再一次地暴露出美国帝国主义的阴险凶狠，无恶不作，是中国人民的死敌。原来美国前驻沈领事馆是个间谍活动的中心。由华盛顿派到东北的那些所谓“外交人员”，没有什么正当业务，而只是偷偷摸摸地进行那种见不得人的罪恶勾当。他们收买日本法西斯残余分子和蒙汉奸细，建立庞大的间谍组织，建立十一处情报据点，刺探我军政情报，破坏我人民解放区和人民革命事业。在东北的国民党匪军已经全部被肃清以后，沈阳的美国帝国主义分子不但没有死心，反而布置潜伏活动，企图打入内蒙，策动叛乱，颠覆我人民政府；并公然聚众毒打我国工人，横逞凶暴。我人民政府决不能容许帝国主义分子和他们的奴仆在中国境内横行不法，图谋不轨，所以这一群罪犯的犯罪阴谋被发觉后，便迅速地落入法网，遭受应得的惩罚。
    沈阳市人民法院对于两案的判决，伸张了中国人民的正义和威权，对于胆敢危害我人民祖国和侵犯我人民权利的帝国主义，给了应得的教训。无论那个国家的任何外交人员派驻任何国家，从事间谍活动固然是绝不允许，而殴打驻在国人民亦属触犯刑律。美国政府派往国民党反动政府的所谓“外交人员”，在与美国政府互无外交关系的中华人民共和国的领土上本来只是普通的侨民，现在竟然借所谓“领事馆”的招牌，进行间谍活动，并聚众行凶，就连普通的侨民资格也完全丧失了。我人民政府执行国家主权，将直接从事犯罪行为的罪犯法办，而将指挥和掩护犯罪勾当的美国前驻沈领事馆全体外籍人员驱逐出境，消灭这一罪恶的渊薮，乃是应当做而且必须做的事情。当罪犯瓦尔德被拘捕后，美国帝国主义政府曾大肆叫嚣。现在沈阳市人民法院不但将瓦尔德定罪，而且接着将美间谍案宣判，并将两案的起诉书和判决书全部公布，瓦尔德、史笃克辈的罪行，已暴露在全世界的面前，美国政府再没有什么可以诡辩了。须知中国人民政府是人民自己的强有力的政府，它有决心和力量保卫本国的独立自由和领土主权完整，保卫人民的革命成果和一切合法权益，而决不允许外国帝国主义侵略我国主权，干涉我国内政，压迫我国人民。帝国主义者在中国领土上横行不法的时代是永远地一去不复返了，帝国主义者依靠讹诈恫吓来欺骗中国人民的时代是永远地一去不复返了。
