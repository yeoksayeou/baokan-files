     Section 4: The Revolutionary, Militant and Practical Nature of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
     The Militancy of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
     Marxist-Leninist economics is also militant. Marxist-Leninists believe that the "direct task of science is to put forward a real slogan of struggle, that is, to objectively point out that this struggle is the product of a certain production relations system, to understand the inevitability of this struggle, the content of this struggle and its development process and conditions..." (Lenin: "What are the 'Friends of the People'") Marxist-Leninist political economy, whether in the narrow or broad sense, whether it is guiding the international proletariat in the struggle to overthrow the capitalist system and establish a socialist society, or guiding the masses of people in colonial and semi-colonial countries in the struggle for a people's democratic revolution to establish a new democratic society, or in the struggle against domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces after the victory of the revolution, is such a militant science or militant weapon.

     The militancy of Marxist-Leninist political economy is also manifested in the fact that Marxist-Leninist political economy itself was established, grew and developed in struggle, that is, it was established, grew and developed in the sharp struggle against bourgeois political economy, petty-bourgeois political economy, anarchists, revisionists, all kinds of opportunists, and other various reactionary and erroneous economic theories, economic viewpoints and economic thoughts. Its theoretical essence is full of revolutionary militancy.

     Marxist-Leninist Political Economy was Established and Grew in the Struggle Against Various Schools of Bourgeois Political Economy

     When Marx engaged in political economy research, it was precisely when the death knell of bourgeois political economy was ringing and it was heading towards vulgarization. At that time, bourgeois political economists were striving to distort the truth and were striving to defend the bourgeoisie's exploitation of the proletariat. Therefore, when Marx established proletarian political economy, he had to stand on the position of safeguarding the interests of the proletariat and first strictly criticize this kind of bourgeois political economy. Only in this process of criticizing bourgeois political economy could Marx's, that is, the proletariat's, political economy be established.

     Therefore, from the day of its birth, Marxist-Leninist political economy has carried out a long-term struggle against various schools of bourgeois political economy, various economic theories and economic viewpoints such as utopian socialists, and the economic theories and viewpoints of petty-bourgeois political economists, and in particular, has given profound and serious blows to the theoretical viewpoints of the vulgar schools of bourgeois political economy.

     The first volume of Marx's Das Kapital, published in 1867, is Marx's representative work exposing the laws of economic movement in capitalist society and criticizing bourgeois political economy theory. Therefore, the subtitle of Das Kapital is also called "Critique of Political Economy" for this reason. Precisely because Das Kapital is a critique of bourgeois political economy doctrines, it is fully revolutionary and critical. It exposes the truth of capitalist society and points out the contradictions and exploitation of capitalism. Therefore, it aroused the anger and terror of the bourgeoisie and its hired "managers"—bourgeois political economists. They hated the publication of Das Kapital very much. When the first volume of Das Kapital was published, "The spokesmen of the bourgeoisie, learned and unlearned, initially wanted to suffocate Das Kapital with silence" (Marx: Preface to the first edition of Das Kapital, Volume 1), just as they had treated Marx's other works before. Marx and Engels fought against this despicable attitude of silence on the part of the bourgeoisie and its "managers" in many ways. They used various methods to publish articles in newspapers and magazines to publicize and introduce their theories to the working class (some of these articles were collected in the book "Political Economy Essays" published by the Liberation Press during the Anti-Japanese War, and after the war, four articles were collected by Shen Zhiyuan in the form of an appendix in "Preparation for Studying Das Kapital". In addition, Engels's "Commentary on Das Kapital" for the "Two-Week Review" is also collected in Engels's "On Das Kapital" translated by Zhang Hanfu and Xu Dixin. Guo Dali's translation of "Correspondence on Das Kapital" also includes Engels's "Commentary on Das Kapital" published in the "Democratic Weekly" (called "Marx's Das Kapital" in "Political Economy Essays"), and Wang Yanan and Guo Dali's translation of the second edition of "Das Kapital" also includes ten letters from Marx and Engels on Das Kapital, which are all very important papers or letters introducing Das Kapital). However, the actual course of events was completely contrary to the wishes of the bourgeoisie. Marx's doctrine was warmly welcomed and widely supported by the proletariat and communist parties of various countries. Therefore, the bourgeoisie's tactic of trying to suffocate Das Kapital with silence quickly failed. After the failure, bourgeois political economists changed to using criticism, and began to pick on and criticize Marx's writing style and method of explanation. They criticized Marx's masterpiece for being unpopular, saying that it was not easy for the proletariat to understand, but the response of the vast majority of readers at the time was that: "The narration of this book, except for a very special few parts, is generally characterized by being easy to understand, clear and very vivid (although the object it explores is the peak of science)". And it is believed that Marx is completely the opposite of many scholars of bourgeois political economy, pointing out that those bourgeois economic scholars "write books in very obscure, very dry and uninteresting words that simply break the brains of ordinary people." (Preface to the second edition of the first volume of Das Kapital)

　　政治经济学教程绪论（５８）
　  政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    王学文
    第四节　马列主义政治经济学的革命性、战斗性与实践性
    马列主义政治经济学的战斗性
    马列主义经济学同时是具有战斗性的。马列主义者认为一种“科学底直接任务是要提出一个真正的斗争的口号，即是要客观地指明这个斗争是一定生产关系体系底产物，要了解这个斗争的必然性，这个斗争的内容及其发展行程和条件……”（列宁：“什么是人民之友”）。马列主义政治经济学不论狭义的或广义的，不论它在指导国际无产阶级为推翻资本主义制度，建立社会主义社会而斗争中，不论它在指导殖民地半殖民地人民大众为人民民主革命建立新民主主义社会而斗争中，也不论它在革命胜利以后，与国内外反革命势力斗争中便是这样一种战斗的科学或战斗的武器。
    马列主义政治经济学的战斗性，也表现于马列主义政治经济学本身是从斗争中建立成长发展起来的，即是说它是在与资产阶级政治经济学、小资产阶级政治经济学、无政府主义者、修正主义者、各色各样的机会主义者，及其他各种反动的错误的经济理论与经济观点经济思想的尖锐斗争中建立成长与发展起来的，它理论的本身就充满着革命的战斗性。
    马列主义政治经济学是在与资产阶级各派政治经济学斗争中建立成长起来的
    当马克思从事政治经济学研究的时候，正当资产阶级政治经济学丧钟敲响走向庸俗化的时候。当时资产阶级政治经济学者正努力于歪曲真理，正努力为资产阶级对无产阶级的剥削辩护。因此当马克思建立无产阶级政治经济学的时候，必须站在维护无产阶级利益的立场上，先对这种资产阶级政治经济学予以严格的批判，而且也只有在这种对资产阶级政治经济学批判的过程中，马克思的，也即无产阶级的政治经济学才能建立起来。
    所以马列主义政治经济学从它诞生之日起，就对资产阶级各派政治经济学，与空想的社会主义者等各种经济理论经济观点，与小资产阶级政治经济学者的经济理论观点，进行批判展开了长期的斗争，特别是对于庸俗派各派资产阶级政治经济学的理论观点，给予了深刻的严重的打击。
    一八六七年出版的马克思资本论第一卷，就是马克思暴露资本主义社会经济运动规律，批判资产阶级政治经济学理论的代表著作，所以资本论的副题又叫做“政治经济学批判”，就是因为这个缘故。正因为资本论是批判资产阶级政治经济学学说的，它带有充分的革命性、批判性，它揭露了资本主义社会真相，指出了资本主义的矛盾和剥削，因此引起了资产阶级及其御用的“管事”们——资产阶级政治经济学者们的愤怒与恐怖，他们十分痛恨资本论的出版。当资本论第一卷出版时，“资产阶级的代辩人，博学的，无学的，当初都想用沉默来把资本论闷死”（马克思：资本论第一卷第一版跋文），好象以前他们对待马克思的其它各种著作一样。马克思与恩格斯对于资产阶级及其“管事”们这种卑鄙的缄默态度，作了很多的斗争，他们用了各种方法在报纸杂志上定文章，向工人阶级宣传介绍自己的理论（这些文章的一部分，抗日时期曾收集在解放社出版的政治经济学论丛一书里，战后有四篇又为沈志远以附录形式搜集在研习资本论的准备，此外章汉夫许涤新译的恩格斯论资本论一书中亦搜有恩格斯为两周评论而作的资本论述评一文，郭大力译的资本论通讯集中亦附有恩格斯在民主周刊发表的资本论述评（在政治经济学论丛中叫做马克思底资本论），王亚南与郭大力译的资本论第二版也附有十篇克思与恩格斯关于资本论的通信，都是介绍资本论很重要的论文或通信）。可是事实的进行却与资产阶级的愿望完全相反，马克思的学说得到了各国无产阶级与共产党的热烈欢迎与广泛拥护。于是资产阶级企图用沉默的方法来把资本论闷死的战术很快就宣告失败了。失败后资产阶级政治经济学者就改用批评的方法，开始是挑剔非难马克思的文体和说明方法，他们非难马克思这部巨著，写的不通俗，说它不易为无产阶级所了解，可是当时广大读者的反映却认为：“这书的叙述，除了极特殊的少数部分外，一般地是以容易理解、明晰和非常生动（虽然它所探讨的对象是科学的高峰）为特征的”。并认为马克思与资产阶级政治经济学的许多学者完全相反，指出那些资产阶级经济学者“用非常晦涩，非常枯燥无味，简直要把普通人的关脑炸破的文字来著书。”（资本论第一卷第二版跋文）
