[This news dispatch from Shanghai] Our reporter Zhou Ziqin reports: In Shanghai, labor-capital disputes in private enterprises, due to the People's Government's adherence to the principle of "both labor and capital benefit, develop production" and its correct and reasonable mediation, have enabled Shanghai's labor-capital relations to develop along a proper path.

After Shanghai's liberation, labor-capital disputes once increased month by month. In the five months from June to October, the Labor Bureau of the People's Government received and handled 3,691 labor disputes. From the nature of the disputes, in the three months of June, July, and August, totaling 1,684 cases, those belonging to the resumption of business and work accounted for 40%, those improving employee treatment accounted for 30%, those where capitalists requested work stoppages, production reductions, or wage reductions and layoffs due to a lack of raw materials and poor sales accounted for 20%, and the remaining 10% were individual disputes. From the industries where disputes occurred: the textile industry (mainly dyeing, knitting, towels, bedsheets, and woolen spinning) accounted for 25%, machinery, ironwork, hardware, and electrical machinery industries accounted for 13.7%, the chemical industry (mainly rubber, papermaking, and pharmaceuticals) accounted for 11.5%, the catering industry accounted for 8.1%, commerce accounted for 11.4%, the transportation industry accounted for 6%, arts and culture accounted for 4%, financial enterprises accounted for 3.4%, the porterage industry accounted for 6.1%, and others accounted for 10.8%. In September and October, labor-capital disputes increased substantially, with the textile industry ranking first, followed by the porterage industry, and the rest being the catering, machinery, ironwork, clothing, hardware, electrical materials, and chemical industries.

From the above situation, it can be seen that: In the labor-capital disputes that occurred in the past five months, the main issues were the resumption of work and business and requests for wage adjustments and improved treatment. This is because when Shanghai has not yet completely broken away from the imperialist-dependent colonial market and entered an independent and self-reliant new democratic economic market, some production is bound to temporarily tend towards a sluggish and shrinking phenomenon, so the issue of resuming work and business is bound to occur during this transition period; but on the other hand, due to the unreasonable phenomena existing in the past wage system, the wages of some workers were indeed too low and the disparity was too great, so it was inevitable that workers in employment would propose wage adjustments. According to Shanghai's experience, it is impossible to raise this issue too early and demand a universal solution, but individual phenomena that are too low should be appropriately adjusted. Secondly, it can be seen that the industries with the most disputes are mainly consumer industries such as textiles, porterage, catering, and clothing. The former is due to the blockade by US imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, which hindered raw materials and sales, thus increasing production difficulties; the latter is because of the destruction of the corrupt Kuomintang reactionary ruling organs, those consumer industries are bound to decline, thus increasing labor-capital disputes.

When mediating labor-capital disputes, the Labor Bureau conducts careful investigations in advance, firmly grasps the principle of "both labor and capital benefit, develop production," and handles them reasonably according to the specific circumstances, using administrative power to intervene appropriately when necessary, and never letting them drift. For example, in early September, the Great China Match Company applied to tighten production and lay off employees, and stopped work in factories in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Zhenjiang at the same time. After investigation, the factory still had the strength to start work, and immediately ordered it to resume work within a time limit and not to reduce staff arbitrarily. The Shanghai Cement Factory also requested to lay off three-quarters of the workers in September, and after investigation and education, only one-fifth of the workers were reduced. When dealing with some complex cases, such as the dispute on the Dongshan ship of the Sanbei Shipping Company and the dismissal dispute at the Lanxin Theater, which involved all parties, all relevant parties were invited to handle them together, and the results were quickly concluded after several mediation sessions.

Regarding the settlement of labor-capital disputes, according to Shanghai's experience, in addition to passively mediating, it is necessary to actively strengthen policy education for both labor and capital. In order to carry out this work, the Labor Bureau, in cooperation with the General Labor Union, established nine workers' schools with a total of more than 1,300 students. At the same time, through the newspaper's reader question-and-answer column, the questions raised by both labor and capital are systematically answered publicly, or correct guidance is given by means of individual written replies. This method plays a great role. At the beginning of the liberation, some workers had certain excessive actions due to insufficient understanding of the policies and carrying vengeful thoughts, but after education, these deviations have been greatly reduced. In the most difficult days, workers voluntarily proposed to reduce wages and benefits to maintain production and took the initiative to make concessions to capitalists. For example, in August and September alone, there were as many as 50 cases in which workers voluntarily proposed to reduce wages and benefits. It can be seen that workers are willing to sacrifice their temporary interests to take care of the overall situation with great spirit. On the capitalist side, they were initially skeptical of the government's policies and passively waited and watched the development of production, but due to the correct and reasonable handling of labor-capital disputes by the People's Government, most of these doubts have been eliminated. Especially since September, due to the continuous victories of the People's Liberation Army and the rapid restoration of transportation throughout the country, industrial orders have increased greatly, and many factories that had stopped work have started work. Those who used to work only half-time or every other day are now working full-time, and some new factories have also been established. Capitalists have seen the prospects for the development of industry in the new China, greatly increasing their confidence and enthusiasm.

In the future, the solution to labor-capital relations in Shanghai's private enterprises will mainly be through the signing of collective contracts, rectifying labor discipline, rewarding production, and improving production efficiency. The Shanghai Labor Bureau is now calling on private enterprises to widely sign collective contracts (the photography industry has already signed them) and is mobilizing all industries and factories to establish relatively reasonable management methods, concentrating on sorting out several factories with relatively poor labor discipline, in order to correct the phenomena of anarchism, lack of organization, and lack of discipline existing in some workers.

　　经人民政府正确合理调处
  　沪劳资关系步入正规
    工人照顾困难自动降低工资
  　资方解除顾虑迅速恢复生产
    【本报上海专讯】记者周子芹报导：上海市私营企业的劳资争议，由于人民政府坚持了“劳资两利、发展生产”的方针，正确合理的进行了调处，因而使上海市的劳资关系能循着正当的道路发展。
    上海解放后，劳资争议曾经一度逐月增多。由六月到十月的五个月中，经人民政府劳动局收到和处理的劳资纠纷达三六九一件。从纠纷的性质来看，六、七、八三个月共一六八四件，其中属于复业复工者占百分之四十，改善职工待遇者占百分之三十，资方因原料缺乏、销路欠佳要求停工减产或减薪解雇者占百分之二十，其余百分之十为个别争议。从发生争议的行业看：纺织业（主要是染织、针织、毛巾、被单、毛纺）占百分之二十五，机器、铁工及五金电机业占百分之十三．七，化工业（主要是橡胶、造纸、制药）占百分之十一．五，饮食业占百分之八．一，商业占百分之十一．四，交通运输业占百分之六，游艺文化占百分之四，金融企业占百分之三．四，搬运业占百分之六．一，其他为百分之十．八。九、十两月份劳资争议有大量增加，其中以纺织业占第一位，搬运业次之，其余即为饮食、机器、铁工、服饰、五金电料、化学工业等。
    从以上情况首先可以看出：在以往五个月所发生的劳资争议中，主要是复工复业和要求调整工资改善待遇问题。这是由于当上海尚未完全摆脱依附于帝国主义性的殖民地市场而走入独立自主的新民主主义的经济市场时，有些生产势必暂时的趋于萧条萎缩现象，故在此过渡期复工复业问题必然发生；但另方面则由过去工资制度中存在不合理现象，部分工人工资确实太低，悬殊太大，故在业工人中提出调整工资是必然的。根据上海经验，过早的提出这一问题，并要求普遍解决是不可能的，但个别过低现象则应适当加以调整。其次可以看出：发生争议最多的主要是纺织、搬运及饮食、服饰等消费性行业。前者是由于美帝国主义及国民党反动派的封锁，原料及销路受到阻碍，因而增加了生产困难；后者则由于腐化的国民党反动统治机构的摧毁，那些消费性的行业势必走向没落，因而增多了劳资争议。
    在调处劳资争议时，劳动局事先均进行慎重的调查，紧紧掌握“劳资两利，发展生产”的原则，根据具体情况进行合理处理，必要时运用行政力量适当加以干涉，决不任其自流。如大中华火柴公司于九月初申请紧缩生产，裁减职工，并将上海、杭州、镇江各厂一齐停工。经调查结果，该厂尚有力量可以开工，当即令其限期复工，不得任意减员。上海水泥厂亦于九月份要求裁减四分之三的工人，经调查教育后，只减去工人五分之一。在处理一些复杂案件时，如三北轮船公司东山轮纠纷，兰心戏院解雇纠纷，皆牵涉各方面，就邀请各有关方面共同处理，结果经几次调解即迅速了结。
    关于劳资争议的解决，根据上海的经验，除消极的进行调处外，必须从积极方面加强劳资双方的政策教育，劳动局为了进行这一工作，曾配合总工会创设了九个工人学校，学生总数达一千三百余人。同时并通过报纸的读者问答栏，有系统的把劳资双方提出来的问题公开予以解答，或用个别函复的办法，给以正确的指导，这种办法起的作用是很大的。在解放之初，曾有部分工人因对政策了解不够，带着复仇思想，因而产生某些过火行动，但经过教育之后，这些偏向已大大减少。在最困难的日子里，工人曾自动提出减低工资待遇，维持生产，主动向资本家让步。如八九两月份工人自动提出减低工资待遇者即达五十件之多。可以看到工人是不惜牺牲自己的暂时利益来照顾全局的伟大精神。在资本家方面，最初对政府政策怀疑，对发展生产消极观望，但由于人民政府正确合理的处理劳资争议，这些怀疑也就大部消除了。特别自九月份以后，由于解放军节节胜利，全国各地交通迅速恢复，工业定货大大增加，已停工的许多工厂都开工了，过去只开半工或隔日工的，现在也开全工了，还有些新的工厂也办起来了。资本家看到了新中国工业发展的前途，大大提高了信心和积极性。
    今后上海市私营企业劳资关系的解决，主要是通过订立集体合同，整顿劳动纪律，奖励生产，提高生产效率。现上海市劳动局正号召私营企业广泛地订立集体合同（已签订的有照像业）并发动各业各厂树立起比较合理的管理方法，集中力量整理好几个劳动纪律比较差的工厂，以改正部分工人中存在着的无政府、无组织、无纪律的现象。
