　　A Record of Soviet Experts and Anti-Epidemic Team's Work in Inner Mongolia to Prevent and Control Plague
    Li Zhizhong
    This time, I accompanied Soviet epidemiology expert, Stalin Prize winner, and Director of the Epidemiology Department of the Second Moscow Medical University, Professor Rogozin, as well as the captain of the Soviet Red Cross Half-Moon Society Anti-Epidemic Expedition Team, Maisky, and others to the plague epidemic centers in Chahar and Inner Mongolia to carry out epidemic prevention work. Although the time, including the return to Beijing for summary, was only twenty-two days, under the leadership of the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee and with the concerted efforts of Chinese and Soviet anti-epidemic workers, not only was the spread of the plague contained, the source of infection discovered, and scientific epidemic prevention methods popularized, achieving a great victory. More importantly, our Soviet friends provided us with many good examples in their work, allowing all those who worked with them, be they local Party and government cadres and the people, or anti-epidemic workers, to learn a great deal. In addition to a separate summary of this work, here I would like to discuss some of my gains.
　　I. Resolutely, Quickly, and Accurately Complete Tasks Under Any Circumstances.
    On November 3rd, we picked up Professor Rogozin from the airport and took him to the Beijing Hotel. It was already 5:00 PM, and he hadn't had lunch. However, he refused all hospitality and immediately requested to understand the epidemic situation in Chahar. He said that after receiving the order to assist China in epidemic prevention work on the night of October 28th, he only spent two hours preparing before taking off from Moscow early on the morning of October 29th. He was delayed by wind and snow on the way for two days and expressed great regret for this delay. He was determined to stop the plague epidemic threatening the central areas of the new China in the shortest possible time to realize Marshal Stalin's concern for the Chinese people. Therefore, it was necessary to use every minute and every second to complete the task quickly and accurately. Thus, as soon as he landed, he first asked Vice Minister He to introduce the epidemic situation, then attended the second meeting of the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee, and only ate dinner at 11:00 PM. At the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee meeting, a plan was set to stop the spread of the plague within two weeks; we set off for Zhangjiakou early the next morning. The Soviet Red Cross Half-Moon Society Anti-Epidemic Expedition Team, which had previously helped us eliminate the plague in Northeast China and Rehe, had originally completed its mission and returned home, but was also recalled and arrived in Beijing on the morning of November 4th. The entire team of thirty-two people did not get off the train but traveled with Professor Rogozin and others to Zhangjiakou early on the 4th.
    From then on, our entire work moved towards the plan of stopping the plague epidemic within two weeks. In areas with convenient transportation, better material conditions, higher cultural standards, and more complete sanitary facilities, two weeks is not a short time. For plague with a known source of infection and prevention methods, it can be stopped in two weeks. However, in Chahar and Inner Mongolia, with inconvenient transportation and poor economic and cultural conditions, many places do not even have traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. The plan to stop the epidemic in two weeks was a daunting task. It was necessary to overcome many difficulties, especially to change the work style of some comrades who were not good at seizing valuable time, often holding unprepared meetings, making lengthy and aimless speeches, doing things slowly, and easily wasting a day. Sometimes, their determination to overcome difficulties was also insufficient.
    When we arrived in Zhangjiakou, it was already 10:00 PM. Upon arrival at the provincial government, Professor Rogozin immediately asked the provincial chairman to introduce the epidemic situation and the anti-epidemic measures that had been taken. He listened patiently and asked carefully. The meeting was held in a cold room and proceeded tensely until 2:00 AM before dinner was served. During the meeting, he apologized to the responsible comrades of the province; immediately discussing work upon arrival was to implement the decisions of the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee and express Marshal Stalin's concern for the Chinese people. Therefore, he asked everyone to overcome all difficulties and complete the task on time.
    From then on, it became a routine: upon arriving at each place, listening to reports from local Party and government and health workers, and then deciding on solutions. This was the case from Zhangjiakou to Chahan Bengbeng in Inner Mongolia. They only slept three to five hours each day, and dinner was postponed until 12:00 AM. Sometimes, work continued until midnight, and they would get up again after two or three hours of sleep to continue working. The day's work was completed on the same day.
    In Chahar, an anti-epidemic team spent a day in the county seat discussing and arranging work with the county government without immediately distributing the anti-epidemic team members to the villages. We happened to arrive, and Professor Rogozin believed that the anti-epidemic team should start work immediately upon arrival. After we listened to the local work plan, we calculated that it would take fifteen days to complete preventive vaccinations for the entire county's epidemic area population. The difficulty was the lack of syringes. In addition, there was no transportation for implementing the step-by-step epidemic reporting from the village to the county. The isolation facilities were not yet found. He was very anxious. Yes, there were many difficulties in carrying out all work. The key question was whether we had exhausted all methods and were determined to overcome the difficulties. After considering the situation with the local responsible comrades, all solutions were found. The next day, the anti-epidemic team members set off immediately, and the completion speed of the original work plan was shortened by three to five times.
    Having the greatest sense of responsibility, the greatest subjective initiative and courage is the foundation for overcoming all difficulties, enhancing the confidence of victory, and reaching the final victory. Of course, this courage and confidence are built on a solid scientific foundation and correct summary of experience. In the past, pneumonic plague and septicemic plague were generally considered difficult to cure. Among bourgeois scholars, the few individual cases of cured pneumonic plague patients had to be published in medical journals and become important documents. However, under the guidance of Stalin's thought of caring for the people, Soviet medical workers did not only cure individual cases of pneumonic plague and septicemic plague but changed the terrible "law" that "nine out of ten pneumonic plague patients die." The Maisky team cured many pneumonic plague and septicemic plague patients in Northeast China and Rehe, reducing the mortality rate of pneumonic plague and septicemic plague patients to below 50%. This experience can eliminate much of the excessive fear of plague. Even more successful was their experience in eradicating plague in a short period after the October Revolution, the spirit of mobilizing all forces to fight against the epidemic, which was implemented and successful in the epidemic prevention work of the people of Northeast China, and once again implemented and brilliantly successful in Inner Mongolia and North China within two weeks.
    Under the demonstration of this working spirit, everyone who came into contact with them became tense, changed the time unit from days to seconds, and changed "wait a while" and "take it easy" to start working immediately. With the great movement of the masses, various difficulties were overcome, and many objective conditions unfavorable to the work were transformed. For example, in less than a week, 180,000 people were vaccinated in the vast and sparsely populated urban and rural areas of Inner Mongolia and Chahar. Despite the freezing weather, anti-rat trenches were dug in all the epidemic-stricken villages. Rat catching, rat prevention, and environmental sanitation work were carried out. Village health committees and a daily reporting system were quickly established. The maintenance of the health of villagers in the epidemic area and the promotion of quarantine work, the establishment of isolation facilities and laboratories, the expansion and deepening of publicity, and the investigation of sources of infection were all completed quickly and accurately. The overall work plan from Inner Mongolia to Zhangyuan was completed two days ahead of schedule.
    This achievement was not expected by some people, could not be accomplished in countries outside the socialist and new democratic social systems, and was unimaginable and impossible for bourgeois scholars to accomplish. The working spirit of the Soviet people is the Stalinist working spirit, which has now been implemented in every Soviet citizen. Because the Soviet people have this spirit, they have not only continuously defeated domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary enemies 32 years after the October Revolution but also carried out socialist political, economic, and cultural construction and defeated fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan, becoming a strong bulwark for world people's democracy and lasting peace. In health work, in a very short period after the revolution, they completely eradicated various epidemics such as smallpox, plague, cholera, and typhus left over by the Tsarist regime and thoroughly changed the people's ignorance, superstition, and unsanitary customs.
　　II. Characteristics of People's Scientists
    The Soviet anti-epidemic experts, headed by Professor Rogozin, firmly grasped scientific principles at all times and in all places, opposing any unscientific statements or views. In the reflections of the epidemic situation in various places, it was always said that people died in this village, and cats, cows, pigs, and dogs also died. This came not only from the mouths of general cadres but also from some health workers. Every time Professor Rogozin listened patiently, he would say, "Plague can only be transmitted from rats to humans and from humans to humans. Other livestock (except camels) are not infected with plague. Other livestock also have their plagues, but they are not necessarily transmitted to humans." This was upholding the truth. Unlike some of our comrades, who mistakenly made far-fetched associations and even uncritically accepted some incorrect opinions.
    They have profound theories and technologies, which are summarized from 32 years of socialist health construction experience. These theories are closely related to the people and are successful experiences summarized through the practice of the broad masses. The Maisky team also has successful experiences summarized from the practice of the people of Northeast China. This is fundamentally different from the bourgeois scientists of Britain, the United States, Germany, Japan, and France, who only pay attention to the observation of individual and unique phenomena, are locked in ivory towers, are high above the masses, and even adhere to scientific theories that are contrary to the interests of the masses. Therefore, the anti-epidemic methods they propose always maintain the highest scientific principles, and they never forget the interests of the masses. Such strong scientific principles combined with such a strong mass viewpoint are the prominent characteristics of Soviet scientists, the most progressive people's scientists of mankind.
    First of all, they have different views from Japanese epidemiologists on the source of plague transmission. Japanese epidemiologists believe that plague is a disease of domestic rats and that domestic rats are carriers. However, Soviet epidemiologists, through actual investigations in Northeast China, especially by culturing plague bacilli from wild rats, and in the actual investigation of Chahan Bengbeng Village this time, saw that the families of all patients were located on the edge of the village near the wilderness. Therefore, wild rats are carriers and the source of transmission. The anti-epidemic methods obtained from this are very different. Moreover, scholars of Japanese imperialism certainly do not care about the interests of the people. When encountering plague, they first burn the houses. Before we arrived this time, the houses of every person who died in the epidemic village had been burned, which was a method left over from Japan. In fact, only the roofs, doors, and windows were burned. The rags, wooden barrels, and broken shoes in the house that could transmit the disease were still scattered within the roofless ruins. During the burning of houses in Houyintu Village, according to local people, many rats ran out of the burned houses and fled elsewhere. Professor Rogozin opposed this method and advocated the use of scientific, drug-based disinfection methods that do not damage anything. In fact, this terminal disinfection by burning houses is in no way comparable to regular disinfection. In particular, rat catching, rat prevention, and flea extermination, these important epidemic prevention steps, were completely not adopted by the people who burned the houses. Some epidemic villages mistakenly killed all the dogs and cats. However, the rats and fleas were still untouched. Professor Rogozin said: Dogs do not transmit plague, and cats catch rats. In the Mongolian wilderness, dogs play a great role. If all the cats and dogs are killed, the masses will be dissatisfied. This is indeed the case. When the masses knew that they had to kill dogs and cats, they said, "As long as people don't die or get sick, killing dogs and cats is inevitable."
    In the early stages of the epidemic, the residents of Chahan Bengbeng fled in all directions, becoming the main cause of spreading the epidemic. It just so happened that some villages did not accept people from epidemic villages, so that some patients died on the road, in caves in the wild, and an old man is still missing. Professor Rogozin believed that this not only spread the virus further but was also not a fundamental epidemic prevention method. If early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment are carried out, patients can be cured, and the villages isolating patients and other places will not be infected and spread.
    Someone said that the first female patient in Qianyintu Village became ill after returning from a meeting in Linxi. After repeated questioning and calculation, the date of onset of this patient was actually a month after returning from the meeting in Linxi, so it was impossible to prove that the patient was infected from Linxi. Professor Rogozin pointed out particularly sharply that this was what some people said to oppose women going out to meetings. Someone else said that two patients got better after being seen by a lama. Professor Rogozin jokingly pointed out: Legend has it that King Louis XIV of France could cure plague. All patients who were touched by him would get better. In fact, none of the people touched by Louis XIV were plague patients; the real plague patients all died. This is a story from "Arabian Nights" (i.e., One Thousand and One Nights), which is promoting superstition. The clear and firm class stance of the experts is admirable.
    From Beijing to Inner Mongolia, almost everyone wore masks in the previous days, and some were like facing a formidable enemy. Professor Rogozin said: Wearing masks is effective in preventing influenza. Plague bacilli do not fly all over the air but are transmitted through sick rats, patients, and fleas. Plague is not everywhere now, and this will cause social tension and panic, which is not good. Wearing masks is necessary when contacting patients and when operating in the laboratory. What's the use of wearing masks on the street?
    Based on the last date of onset being November 4th, it was originally suggested to the Central Government that the lockdown could be lifted two weeks later, on November 18th, if no new patients occurred. When we returned to Zhangyuan from Inner Mongolia and Chahar on November 13th, we learned that prices fluctuated after the lockdown, and the exchange supply of grain and coal was difficult. We asked him for his opinion: Could the lockdown be lifted a few days earlier to take care of the people's lives? He immediately and unhesitatingly gave an affirmative answer and immediately sent a telegram through Chairman Zhang of Chahar Province suggesting that the Central People's Government could lift the lockdown two days earlier.
    On November 15th, just as we were returning to Zhangjiakou, during a banquet hosted by Commander Wang of the military region, we learned that four suspected plague deaths were found in Tiaohuliugou Village, Baoyuan County. When this news reached the ears of the two experts, Rogozin and Maisky, the originally very joyful banquet was immediately replaced by anxiety. They had planned to go there the next day, until they called everywhere to inquire and learned that only a few people were sick and had been sick for six days. Only after they notified Zhangbei by telephone to send doctors to check did they and everyone else feel relieved. It was finally proved to be a cold.
    The above facts illustrate that people's scientists are at all times and in all places proceeding from the interests of the masses, working with the masses at all times, and have a very clear class viewpoint. They use all their scientific knowledge to serve the people, and this scientific knowledge is summarized from the practice of the people.
　　III. Scientific Working Methods
    Their scientific methods in carrying out work are also worth learning. I greatly admire Professor Rogozin. After the tiring journey of insufficient sleep, when listening to the often lengthy epidemic reports through translation, he could grasp the key points with just one listen, remember the numbers of onset, and quickly analyze complex problems and arrive at correct inferences. Professor Rogozin has a very fast and accurate memory of people, names, village names, and the time of events. Having learned some simple sentences after two weeks in China, this keen ability to receive new things is a manifestation of tireless concentration, great concern for the surrounding things, careful observation, and a spirit of humble learning, and is also the result of long-term scientific training.
    Even more prominent is that he does not draw conclusions or parrot others before conducting an on-site investigation. He personally arrived at every village in Inner Mongolia where onset occurred, as well as the homes of the patients, and personally looked at the terrain and rat holes of those villages, and checked the bacilli cultured from plague deaths before drawing a definite conclusion. These conclusions were the result of repeated investigations with the masses, village chiefs, local Party and government leaders, and anti-epidemic team workers. Although Chairman Mao has long educated us on this realistic attitude, in actual work, we still sometimes make the mistake of being careless and not seeking thorough understanding. Although most of the plague information was correct this time, there was still some incorrect information. For example, it was reported that many pigs died in Liuduan, Kangbao, but after investigation, it turned out that someone went to the market to sell a dozen piglets, which were suffocated on the road while wrapped in cotton quilts, and the other pigs did not die.
　　IV. Equal, Fraternal Friendship Attitude
    On November 9th, when Professor Rogozin, Secretary of the Chahar Subdivision Party Committee Shi Yulin, and anti-epidemic team members drove two trucks to Qianyintu Village, the masses were very surprised by the sudden arrival of these unexpected guests in this remote Inner Mongolian village with only thirty households. When Comrade Shi said, "This is the anti-epidemic team sent by Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government and the anti-epidemic expert invited from Moscow to prevent plague for everyone," this sentence alone was like saying the password at night, and the masses immediately recognized them as their own people, rushing to surround them, greeting them warmly, and asking about everything. Professor Rogozin then conducted a disease investigation. Yes, the Chinese people all know the resounding names of Beijing, Chairman Mao; Moscow, and Marshal Stalin. However, Professor Rogozin, Captain Maisky, and their anti-epidemic team members gave them an even deeper impression of kindness and friendship this time.
    For many years, the Chinese people have seen all kinds of "foreigners," from "solemn" missionaries to rowdy American soldiers. In short, they are superior to the Chinese people, riding on the necks of the Chinese people. They have their own purposes in coming to China. The attitude adopted by the Chinese people is to respect ghosts and gods and stay away from them. Because they are enemies of the people. The people are very able to recognize the bottom line and intentions of these "foreign adults" in coming to China. This time, the Chinese people adopted a completely different attitude towards Soviet friends, welcoming them in queues, seeing them off enthusiastically, shouting "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" and "Long live Stalin!" sincerely thanking Comrade Stalin for his concern for the Chinese people. In the Longwang Temple in Inner Mongolia, thousands of people lined up in the cold wind waiting to see off the anti-epidemic experts. At the evenings in Zhangbei and Zhangjiakou, the masses enthusiastically presented flowers and gifts and spoke heart-to-heart. Especially on the night of November 17th, there were over 10,000 people seeing them off at the Zhangjiakou Railway Station, singing, drumming, shouting slogans, and throwing paper scraps. As the train departed, they kept cheering and waving. Many Soviet friends were moved to tears. The old professor's voice trembled and his eyes were wet when he spoke. "The Chinese people are so good!" This was the voice of the Soviet anti-epidemic team members. Similarly, the Soviet people are so good! So great! Sincerely, equally, and self-sacrificingly helping the Chinese people. This is the second time for the people of Chahar. This time it was a reunion of old friends. The first time was in 1945, when the Soviet Red Army defeated Japanese imperialism and liberated the people of Chahar from their iron hooves. In Langwogou, Zhangbei, we paid tribute to the more than 300 Red Army martyrs who bravely and gloriously sacrificed and were buried there. This great spirit of internationalism lives forever in the hearts of the people of Chahar. This time the anti-epidemic team came again, with the same spirit, to help capture and destroy the plague, rescuing the people from the disaster of plague. How could they not express goodwill to Soviet friends? The people are the judges, the most just judges.
    Everyone who works with Soviet friends is reluctant to part when they separate. In Inner Mongolia, Zhangbei, and Zhangjiakou, whenever the Soviet anti-epidemic team leaves, the Chinese anti-epidemic team members surround them, embracing and saying goodbye, and then encouraging each other: See you again in Beijing, in Moscow, goodbye!
    This touching and enthusiastic scene demonstrates the unbreakable friendship between the great Soviet people educated by Stalin and the great Chinese people educated by Chairman Mao.
    The great Soviet people are warm, sincere, straightforward, and clear-cut. They raise opinions and criticize shortcomings. They will not be artificial, hypocritical, or polite. When working, they work seriously and solemnly. When playing, they play to their heart's content. When we completed the task, the 50-year-old Professor Rogozin often couldn't help but dance and sing after dinner. The Soviet anti-epidemic team members sang the Chinese "Marching Tune" and "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China." Then everyone danced the Yangko together. They are selfless, always caring for everyone and every individual. When I raised a glass to congratulate Captain Maisky and his daughter, who had been separated for a long time and had come to Beijing to deliver live bacteria strains, on meeting in the capital of the new China, he immediately said: Cheers to the health of all comrades' relatives and friends present! They respect the Chinese people so much. When they saw the achievements of the Chinese anti-epidemic team's work, they admired it so much. When they saw the magnificent buildings in the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, and the Temple of Heaven, and saw the exquisite ancient industrial products such as bronze, porcelain, silk, satin, and brocade, they greatly praised the greatness and wisdom of the Chinese laboring people who created China's long-standing ancient civilization. Professor Rogozin frequently asked for the names of the design engineers of these buildings, but we couldn't answer. At that time, the feudal emperors would not have taken these laboring people into their eyes, and would not have recorded their names in the annals of history? Regarding the backwardness that still remains in China today, Soviet friends are confident that it can be quickly eliminated by the efforts of the Chinese people. They always encourage the Chinese anti-epidemic personnel working together, confirming that every Chinese person who moves forward has a very bright future.
    They all possess these highest human virtues, which is a common point, but each person has different, special strengths and personalities. For example, the old professor is so sharp, clear, always talking and laughing, very humorous, very good at joking, speaks very poetically, and shows his great erudition in all aspects. Captain Maisky is very calm and treats people with great kindness and amiability. The epidemic prevention methods he suggests are the most specific and the most applicable in Chinese villages. Everyone else has their own strengths.
    Professor Rogozin and the experts, Captain Maisky and the anti-epidemic team members, have already left China. The reason why they are so welcomed by the Chinese people and have left an indelible contribution to the Chinese people is due to what the old professor often said: "Comrade Stalin requires every expert to not only be proficient in their own business but also to be proficient in Marxism-Leninism." This is also the path that the scientists of the new China should take and the direction they should strive towards.

　　记苏联专家及防疫队去内蒙防治鼠疫
    李志中
    这次我与苏联流行病学专家，斯大林奖金获得者，莫斯科第二医科大学流行病学讲座主任教授罗果金博士，及苏联红十字半月协会防疫远征队麦斯基队长等同去察北及内蒙鼠疫流行中心地带，进行防疫工作，时间连回北京总结，虽不过短短的二十二天，而在中央防疫委员会的领导下，中苏防疫工作者协力合作中，不但制止了鼠疫的蔓延，探得了传染来源，普及了科学的防疫方法，得到很大的一个胜利。更重要的是苏联朋友们，在工作中，给我们许多好的榜样，使我们凡是与他们共同工作者，不管是地方党政干部及人民，不管是防疫工作者，学习到不少的东西，除了另做此次工作总结外，这里谈的是我的一点收获。
　　一、在任何的条件下，坚决、迅速、准确的完成任务。
    十一月三日，我们把罗果金教授自飞机场接到北京饭店，已是下午五点钟了，他还未吃中饭，但他拒绝了一切的招待，马上要求了解察北的疫情。他说十月二十八日夜，接到协助中国防疫工作的命令后，只经过有两小时的准备，便于十月二十九日一早，自莫斯科起飞了。路上曾被风雪所阻，迟了两天，言下表现出非常惋惜这两天的延误。他决心一定在最短期间，制止威胁新中国中心地区的鼠疫流行，以实现斯大林大元帅关心中国人民的意愿。所以要利用一分钟，一秒钟，迅速与准确的完成任务。就这样，刚一着陆，便先要求贺副部长介绍疫情，继而参加中央防疫委员会的第二次会议，直到夜十一时才吃饭。在中央防疫委员会议上，定下了两星期内制止鼠疫蔓延的计划；我们便于次日一早出发去张家口了。原在东北及热河帮助我们消灭鼠疫的苏联红十字半月协会防疫远征队，原已完成任务回国，也重新被召返回，于十一月四日晨赶到北京，全队三十二人未下车，即原车与罗果金博士等于四日早起程到张家口。
    从此我们整个工作，便朝着两星期内制止鼠疫流行的计划迈进。如在交通便利，物质条件较好，文化水准提高，卫生设施完善一些的地区，两星期是一个不短的时间，对已找到了病源地，并且有了预防方法的鼠疫，两星期是可以制止着的。而在察北、内蒙，交通不便，经济文化较差的，许多地方连个中医都没有，两星期制止流行的计划，便是一个艰巨的任务。必需克服很多困难。特别要改变不少同志的作风，他们不善于抓着宝贵的时间，时常进行没有准备的会议，作冗长没有中心的发言，做事慢慢吞吞地，随便一幌便是一天，有时克服困难的决心又不太够。
    当我们到张家口，已经晚十时了。一到省政府，罗果金博士便要求省主席介绍疫情，及已作了的防疫措施。耐心的听，仔细的追问，会议在一间冷的房内紧张地进行到深夜二时，才吃晚饭。会中他向省负责同志道了歉；一到马上谈工作，这是为了执行中央防疫委员会上的决议，及表达斯大林大元帅对中国人民的关心。因此要求大家克服一切困难，按时完成任务。
    从此以后，便成了规律，每到一处，便听取当地党政及卫生工作者的报告，然后决定处理办法。从张家口到内蒙察汗崩崩，都是这样。每天只睡三——五小时，晚饭推迟到夜十二时。有时工作继续到半夜，睡二——三小时再起来工作。当天的工作，当天完成。
    在察北，一个防疫队，到了县城一天，与县上商量布置工作，没有把防疫队员，马上分发到村庄。恰遇我们也赶到了，罗果金博士认为：防疫队应该一到就马上展开工作。当我们听取了当地工作计划之后，一计算，需要十五天才能把全县疫区人口预防注射完毕，困难是缺乏注射器。另外在执行由村到县的逐级疫情报告时，没有交通工具。设隔离所，房子还没有找到。他非常焦急了。是的，进行一切工作，困难是多的，问题的关键在于我们是否用尽一切办法，下定决心克服困难。在与当地负责同志考虑了一下之后，一切办法都来了。第二天防疫队员马上出发，原工作计划的完成速度，缩短了三倍到五倍。
    具有最大的责任心，具有最大的主观的能动性及勇气，是克服一切困难，增强胜利信心，和到达最后胜利的基础。当然这种勇气与信心是建筑在坚强的科学基础，及正确的经验总结上的。过去对肺鼠疫及败血性鼠疫，公认为不易治愈的，在资产阶级的学者中，有些治好的个别的肺鼠疫患者，都要在医学杂志上发表，成为重要文献。但苏联的医务工作者，在斯大林关心人民的思想指导之下，治好肺鼠疫及败血性鼠疫却不是个别的病例，而是改变了“肺鼠疫十病九死”的可怕的“定律”。迈斯基队在东北及热河，治好许多肺鼠疫及败血性鼠疫病人，肺鼠疫及败血鼠疫病人的病死率减低到百分之五十以下了。这种经验是可以消除许多对鼠疫过分恐惧心理的。更成功的是十月革命后，他们在短期内消灭鼠疫的经验，那种动员一切力量向疫病作斗争的气魄，在东北人民的防疫工作中贯彻了，并且成功了，又一次在内蒙及华北，也在两星期内贯彻了，辉煌的成功了。
    就在这种工作的精神的示范下，所有接触过他们的人，都紧张起来，把以天为时间单位改为以分秒计算，把“等一等”、“慢慢来”改为马上就干。以群众的伟大运动，克服种种困难，转变了许多不利于工作的客观条件。如不到一星期，在地广人稀的内蒙及察北城乡，预防注射了十八万人。虽是天寒地冻，所有的疫区村庄都挖了防鼠沟。并进行了捕鼠，防鼠，环境卫生工作。很快的建立了村卫生委员，及每日通报制度。对疫区村民健康的维护及检疫工作的推行，隔离所、化验室的设立，扩大并深入的宣传，以及调查传染来源等等工作都迅速、准确的完成了任务。并提前两天完成了从内蒙到张垣的全面的工作计划。
    这种成绩是有些人所没有预计到的，是在社会主义及新民主主义社会制度以外的国度，所不可能完成的，而也是资产阶级学者，所不能想象的，所不可能完成的。而苏联人民这种工作精神是斯大林式的工作精神，现在已贯彻到每一个苏联公民身上。就因为苏联人民有了这种精神，才能在十月革命三十二年后，不但接连战胜了国内外反革命的敌人，而进行了社会主义的政治、经济、文化建设，并战胜了法西斯德、意、日，成为世界人民民主与持久和平的坚强保垒。而在卫生工作上，在革命后很短期间，完全根除了沙皇遗留下来的天花、鼠疫、霍乱、斑疹伤寒等种种疫病，并且把人民的愚昧、迷信、不卫生的风俗习惯，彻底改变了。
　　二、人民科学家的特点
    以罗果金博士为首的苏联防疫专家，任何场合，任何时候，都紧紧的掌握着科学的原则，反对任何不科学的说法、看法。在各地反映疫情中，总有这个村死了人，也死了猫，死了牛，死了猪，死了狗等。这不但出自一般干部的口内，而且有的出自卫生工作者的口中。每当罗果金博士耐心的听完后，就说：“鼠疫只能自鼠传人，又自人传人，别的牲畜（除骆驼外），均不感染鼠疫，其他牲畜也有它们的瘟疫，但不一定传给人。”这是坚持了真理。不象我们有些同志，错误的牵强附会，甚至不批判的接受一些不正确的意见。
    他们有高深的理论与技术，这是自三十二年社会主义的卫生建设经验中，总结出来的，这些理论是与人民密切联系的，是经过广大群众实践的成功的经验总结。在迈斯基队，并有经过东北人民，实践成功的经验总结。这与英、美、德、日、法的资产阶级科学家，只注意个别的，独特的现象的观察，关在象牙之塔内，高高在上，与群众相隔绝，甚至坚持与群众利益相违背的科学理论，有原则的差别。所以他们每次建议的防疫方法，总是保持了最高的科学原则，而更时时不忘的是群众的利益。那么坚强的科学原则，结合着那么强烈的群众观点，便是苏联科学家，人类最进步的人民科学家，突出的特点。
    他们首先与日本的流行病学家，对鼠疫的传染来源有不同的见解。日本流行病学家以为鼠疫是家鼠的病，家鼠是带菌者。但苏联流行病学者自东北的实际调查中，特别是自野鼠中培养出鼠疫杆菌，又在这次察汉崩崩村的实地调查中，见到凡发病的人家，都在村边靠近野地的一端。所以野鼠是带菌者，是传染来源。由此而得的防疫方法，就有很大的差异。更加之日本帝国主义的学者当然不照顾人民利益，一遇鼠疫，首先烧房子。这次在我们没有到之前，疫村每个死了人的房子，都被烧了，这是日本遗下的方法。其实只烧了房顶及门窗，房内可以传病的破布、木桶、破鞋，均依然如故的散在无顶的残垣之内。而在后音土村烧房子时，据当地群众说，有不少老鼠，自被烧的房内跑出逃往他处。罗果金博士反对这种办法，而主张用科学的，药物的不损害一件东西的消毒法。其实这种烧房子的终结消毒，无论如何比不上随时消毒。特别是捕鼠、防鼠、灭蚤，这些重要的防疫步骤，完全未被烧房子的人们所采用。有些疫村错误的把狗打光了，猫杀光了。但老鼠、跳蚤仍是未动。罗果金博士说：狗是不传染鼠疫的，猫是捕老鼠的，在蒙古的原野上，狗的作用很大，如把猫狗全打死了，群众是不满意的。实在是这样，群众知道要打狗杀猫时说：“只要不死人，不生病，打狗杀猫也是无可奈何的事。”
    在疫病流行初期，察汗崩崩的居民四散的逃亡，成为散布疫病的主因。恰好有些村庄不收留自疫村来的人；以致有些病人死在路上，死在野外的山洞里，至今还有一个老汉去处不明。罗果金博士认为这不但更加散布病毒，而且也不是根本防疫的办法。如果早期发现，早期诊断，早期隔离，早期治疗，病人既可痊愈隔离病人的村庄及其他地方也不致传染蔓延。
    有人说，前音土村最初的一个女病人，是自林西开会回来发病的。当时一再追问，推算，此病人发病日期距自林西开会回来时间，竟有一月之久，所以不可能证明该病人是自林西传染而来。罗果金博士特别尖锐的指出：这是一些人反对女人出去开会所说的。另有人说：有两个病人经喇嘛一看更好了。罗果金博士说笑话似地指出：传说法国国王路易十四专会治鼠疫，凡病人经他一摸，便好了。其实路易十四所摸的，都不是鼠疫病人；真正的鼠疫病人是都死了。这是“天方夜谭”（即一千零一夜）的故事，是替迷信作宣传的。专家的阶级立场的明确与稳固是很可佩服的。
    自北京到内蒙，在前些天几乎人人带上了口罩，有些如临大敌。罗果金博士说：带口罩预防流行性感冒是有效的，鼠疫杆菌不会在空气中满天飞，而是借病鼠、病人，及跳蚤传染的，现在并非到处都有了鼠疫，这样引起社会上的神经紧张与恐慌是不好的。带口罩是在接触病人时，在化验室操作时所必需，在街上带口罩有什么用呢。
    根据最后发病日期为十一月四日，原建议中央在两星期后，即十一月十八日，再不发生新病人，即可解除封锁。当我们十一月十三日自内蒙及察北回张垣，得知封锁后物价波动，粮煤交流供应困难，我们即向他征求意见：可否早几天解除封锁，以照顾人民的生活，他马上不犹疑的就作了肯定地答复，并即通过察省张主席打电报建议中央人民政府，可以早两天解除封锁。
    十一月十五日正当我们回张家口，在军区王司令员欢宴的时候，得知在宝源县调狐狸沟村，发现四人疑似鼠疫死者，当这消息一传到罗果金、迈斯基二位专家的耳中时，本来非常欢愉的宴会，马上就被焦虑所代替，他们本准备第二天出发去那里，直到向各处打电话询问，得知只是病了几个人，已病了六天。当时用电话通知张北派医生前去检查后，他们以及大家才安下心来。最后证明是感冒。
    以上这些事实，是说明人民科学家是时时刻刻，处处从群众的利益出发，时时刻刻结合着群众进行工作，并具有非常明确的阶级观点，他们以全部的科学知识来为人民服务，而这些科学知识又是从人民的实践中总结出来的。
　　三、科学的工作方法
    他们在进行工作中的科学方法，也是值得学习的。我非常敬佩罗果金博士，在睡眠不足的疲惫旅程之后，听取经过翻译的时候，常是冗长的疫情报告，只要一遍便抓着了要点，记着了发病的数字，并很快的分析了复杂的问题，得到正确的推断，对好坏分辨的的很快。罗果金博士对人、人名、村名，发生事件的时间记忆的非常快而且准确。来中国两周已会说一些简单的字句，这些对新事物敏锐的接收能力，正是注意力不疲倦的集中，并十分关心周围事物，十分细心观察与十分虚心学习精神的表现，也是长久的科学锻炼的结果。
    更突出的是在未实地调查之前，不下结论，决不人云亦云。他是在亲自到达内蒙每个发病的村庄，及发病的人家，并亲自看了那些村子的地形、老鼠洞；并检查了从鼠疫死者培养出的杆菌，才下肯定的结论。这些结论都是经过了向群众、村长、地方党政负责人，及防疫队工作人员反复调查的结果。这种实事求是的态度，虽早经毛主席教育过我们，但在实际工作中，我们粗枝大叶的不求甚解的毛病仍有时犯。这次鼠疫的情报，虽大部正确，但仍有个别的情报不确。例如：据报康保六段死猪很多，但经调查，其实是有人去集上卖十几只小猪，在路上用棉被子包着，闷死了，其他的猪未死。
　　四、平等的亲兄弟般的友谊态度
    十一月九日，当罗果金博士、察北分区地委书记史玉林及防疫队员等，坐了两辆卡车，开到前音土村时，这一个偏僻的只有三十户人家的内蒙村落，突然来了这些不速之客，群众很为惊奇。当史同志说：“这是中央人民政府毛主席派来的防疫队与自莫斯科请来的防疫专家，来给大家预防鼠疫的。”只这一句，就如同夜间说出通行口令一样，群众马上认识是自己人，争相围拢来，亲热的招呼，问长问短。罗果金博士便进行了疾病调查。是的，中国人民都懂得北京、毛主席；莫斯科、斯大林大元帅这几个响亮的名字。但罗果金博士，迈斯基队长及其防疫队员，这次更给他们一个深刻的亲切友谊的印象。
    多年来，中国人民是看过各式各样的“洋人”的，自“道貌岸然”的传教师，到凶酒胡闹的美国兵。总而言之，他们是高于中国人的，是骑在中国人民脖子上的，他们来中国自有他们的目的。而中国人民所采取的态度是敬鬼神而远之。因为他们是人民的敌人。人民很能识别这些“洋大人”的底细和来中国的企图。这次中国人民对苏联朋友却采取了全然不同的态度，排队的欢迎，热情的欢送，喊中苏友好万岁，喊斯大林万岁，从衷心感谢斯大林同志对中国人民的关怀。在内蒙龙王庙，千百的群众在寒风里列队等候着欢送防疫专家。在张北及张家口的晚会上，群众热烈的献花献礼，心心相印的讲话。特别在十一月十七日夜，在张家口车站有万余的欢送群众，唱歌、打鼓、喊口号、丢纸屑。车开了，一直在欢呼招手。使许多苏联朋友感动的流泪了。老博士在讲话时，也感动的声音发抖，眼睛湿润了。“中国人民真好啊！”这是苏联防疫队员的声音。同样苏联的人民真太好了！太伟大了！真心的、平等的、自我牺牲的帮助中国人民。这对察北人民是第二次了。这次是故友重逢。第一次是在一九四五年，苏联红军击败了日本帝国主义，把察北人民从铁蹄下解放出来。在张北狼窝沟，这次我们凭吊了埋在那里的英勇光荣牺牲的三百多名红军烈士。这种伟大的国际主义的精神，永久活在察北人民心里。这回防疫队又来了，以同样的精神，协助捕灭了鼠疫。从鼠疫的灾害中解救出了人民，他们怎不对苏联朋友表示好感呢？人民是评判员，是最公正的评判员。
    凡与苏联朋友一齐工作的，当分别时，没有不恋恋不舍的，在内蒙、在张北、在张家口，凡苏联防疫队一离开，中国的防疫队员们，便围拢来，拥抱、惜别，后来，互相鼓励一番：在北京、在莫斯科再见吧，再见！
    这种动人的热烈的场面，是表现了斯大林教育下的伟大苏联人民，与毛主席教育下的伟大中国人民的牢不可破的友谊。
    伟大的苏联人民是热情的、真诚的、直爽的、明快的，有意见就提，有缺点就批评，不会做作、虚伪、客气的。工作时是认真严肃的工作。玩起来，是尽兴的玩。当我们完成了任务，已五十岁的罗果金博士常在晚饭后，情不自禁地跳舞，唱歌。苏联防疫队员唱中国的“行军小调”，“没有共产党就没有新中国”。于是大家一齐扭秧歌。他们是毫无自私之心，永久关心大家，关心每一个人：当有一次我举杯庆贺迈斯基队长，与来北京送活菌菌苗的他久别的女儿，在新中国首都相会时；他马上就说：祝在座的一切同志的亲友健康而干杯！他们是那样尊重中国人民。当他们看见中国防疫队工作的成绩，是那样的赞佩。当他们看见故宫、颐和园、天坛等处的雄伟建筑，及看见古代的各种工业品如铜、磁器、绫、罗、绸等等作得那么精致，便非常赞扬中国悠久的古代文明创造者：中国的劳动人民的伟大与智慧。罗果金博士频频的问：这些建筑的设计工程师的名字，我们答不出。那时封建帝王，那会把这些劳动人民看在眼里，那会把他们的名字记在史册呢？对今天中国还遗留下的落后，苏联朋友确信很快可以由中国人民的努力消除掉。他们总是鼓舞着一起工作的中国防疫人员，确认前进的每一个中国人都有很远大的前途。
    他们都具有这些人类最高的美德，这是共同之点，但每个人都有不同的，特殊的长处与个性。如老博士是那么尖锐，明快，总是谈笑风生，很幽默，很会开玩笑，说话很有诗意，从各方面表现他非常博学。迈斯基队长，则是很沉着的，很亲切的和蔼的对待人。他所建议的防疫方法最具体，在中国乡村是最适用的。其他每人都有特长之处。
    罗果金博士及专家们，迈斯基队长及防疫队员们，已经离开了中国。他们之所以如此受中国人民的欢迎，给中国人民留下不可磨灭的功绩，是由于老博士所常说的：“斯大林同志要求每一个专家不但要精通自己的业务，而且要精通马列主义。”这也就是新中国科学家们所应走的道路与努力的方向。
