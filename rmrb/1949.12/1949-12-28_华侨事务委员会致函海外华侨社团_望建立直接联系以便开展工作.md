Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, in order to investigate and study the situation of overseas Chinese and carry out its work, sent letters on the 22nd to overseas Chinese organizations and overseas Chinese newspapers and schools, hoping to establish direct contact. The letter first pointed out: Overseas Chinese compatriots contributed money and efforts to support the motherland and persisted in the War of Resistance during the eight-year war. During the three-year War of Liberation, they either returned to the country to participate in the War of Liberation, or adhered to the people's democratic stance in their places of residence, and waged unyielding struggles against the Kuomintang bandit gang's special agents and running dogs sent abroad. These are indelible contributions of overseas Chinese compatriots to the motherland. The letter continued: After the establishment of the Central People's Government, it has been extremely concerned about overseas Chinese compatriots, especially those in Southeast Asia who are in dire circumstances, and urgently needs to find ways to rescue them. Therefore, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission was quickly established to take charge of this matter. The letter said: The tasks of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission are to investigate and study the situation of overseas Chinese abroad, formulate plans to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese abroad and related welfare undertakings for returned overseas Chinese, unite overseas Chinese in various places, contact overseas Chinese organizations, assist overseas Chinese compatriots to return to the country for investment, find ways to facilitate overseas remittances, take care of and improve the lives of overseas Chinese dependents, provide relief to distressed overseas Chinese, assist overseas Chinese students to return to the country for further education, and guide overseas Chinese affairs at home and abroad.

The letter finally hoped that patriotic overseas Chinese compatriots would widely publicize the Central People's Government's concern for overseas Chinese abroad and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's purpose of serving overseas Chinese; and hoped that overseas Chinese organizations and overseas Chinese schools in various places would establish direct contact with the Commission, and that the newspapers, magazines, and other publications published by overseas Chinese compatriots would be sent to the Commission for reference. In addition, it is hoped that overseas Chinese compatriots in various places, whether individuals or groups, will provide more opinions on future overseas Chinese affairs work.

　　华侨事务委员会致函海外华侨社团
　  望建立直接联系以便开展工作
    【新华社北京二十七日电】中央人民政府华侨事务委员会为调查研究华侨情况以便开展工作，特于二十二日分别致函海外华侨社团和华侨报馆学校，希望建立直接联系。该函首先指出：海外侨胞在八年抗战中，出力出钱，支持祖国，坚持抗战。在三年的解放战争期间，或回国参加解放战争，或在侨居地坚持人民民主立场，与国民党匪帮派往国外的特务走狗作不屈不挠的斗争。这些都是国外侨胞对于祖国的不可磨灭的贡献。该函继称：中央人民政府成立之后，对于国外侨胞备极关怀，尤其是正处于恶劣环境中的东南亚各地侨胞，亟待设法援救，乃迅速成立华侨事务委员会以主持其事。该函说：华侨事务委员会的任务，为调查研究国外华侨的情况，拟定保护国外华侨的正当权益及有关归侨福利事业的方案，团结各地华侨，联络华侨社团，协助侨胞回国投资，设法便利侨汇，照顾与改善侨眷的生活，救济难侨，协助侨生回国升学，以及指导国内外侨务工作。
    该函最后希望爱国侨胞将中央人民政府对国外华侨关怀的本意和华侨事务委员会为华侨服务的宗旨，普遍传告；并希望国外各地的华侨社团和华侨学校直接与该会建立联系，侨胞所出版的报章杂志及其他刊物，检寄该会，以备存查。此外还希望国外各地侨胞，无论个人或团体，对于今后的侨务工作，多多提供意见。
