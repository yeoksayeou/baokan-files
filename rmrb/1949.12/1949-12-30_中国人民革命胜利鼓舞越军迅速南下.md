　　Today, the democratic movement throughout the world is surging like a tidal wave. The five million troops that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang raised with so much money have now vanished. Due to the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, standing on the northern border will not be contemptible enemies, but friends with smiling faces. Under their loving gaze, the Vietnamese army and people will rapidly head south to take the capital directly.

　　Another factor in our favor is the disintegration of the French Empire, an empire weakened by two world wars and paralyzed by a series of French government collapses, internal strife, and the hopeless war in Vietnam. The national struggle of the French people demanding an end to the war of aggression in Vietnam has intensified in the past few months. A general strike involving five million French working men and women was held on November 25th. At the same time, French dockworkers and stevedores refused to load French ships bound for Vietnam.

　　The sparsely populated kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia, three years ago, were strategic bases from which the French aggressors intermittently launched attacks against Vietnam. Today, these two countries are breaking free from French control, as the strength of local national movements has become more active. We have been able to develop an Indochina battlefield, where Laos and Cambodia will fight as victoriously as Vietnam.

　　From a military point of view, the French imperialists should have learned many painful lessons in using mercenary troops. Thousands of recruited Vietnamese soldiers have turned into tools that strike back at French imperialism itself. French strategists had placed their hopes on these mercenaries to extinguish the Vietnamese revolutionary army.

　　Today, the confidence of imminent victory is inspiring the Vietnamese people's hatred for their oppressors. Today, we have the strength to launch a full-scale counter-offensive against the well-equipped French army. In fact, our planned general counter-offensive has already begun in some areas.

　　Currently, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army is everywhere, whether around the enemy or in enemy-controlled cities and villages. All the people united around President Ho Chi Minh are determined to eliminate the French aggressors once and for all. The entire democratic world and all oppressed peoples of all countries are watching our victorious battle.

　　We are determined to fight to the end. We will avenge the tens of thousands of compatriots who have been insulted, tortured, and massacred en masse by the enemy. We are not only fighting to restore the freedom and happiness of our own people, but this will also help liberate the forced people of France and the oppressed people of the French Federation and all countries in the world. The victory of the Vietnamese people and other Indochinese people will bring the victory of world peace a leap forward.

　　The winter of 1949 will determine the fate of the French imperialists, and the spring of 1950 will tell us: "Welcome Victory!"

### 中国人民革命胜利鼓舞越军迅速南下

　　中国人民革命胜利鼓舞越军迅速南下
    在今天，全世界的民主运动正如洪涛巨浪一样地汹涌澎湃。蒋介石匪帮用那样多钱豢养的五百万部队，现在已化为乌有。由于中国人民革命的胜利，站在北边界那一面的，将不是卑贱的敌人，而不是面含微笑的朋友，在他们的敬爱的凝视下，越南的军队和人民将迅速奔向南方直取首都。
    另一个有利于我们的因素，是法兰西帝国的瓦解，这个帝国已成为两次世界大战所削弱，并且由于法国政府的一连串倒台，法国内部的争吵及无望的越南战争而瘫痪。法国人民之要求结束在越南的侵略战争的全国性斗争，已在过去几个月中更为加强。有五百万法国劳动男女参加的总罢工，已于十一月二十五日举行。同时，法国的码头工人和脚夫，都拒绝为开往越南的法国轮船装货。
    人口稀少的老挝和柬埔寨王国，三年以前曾是法国侵略者自那里断断续续向越南进攻的战略基地。今天，这两个国家正在摆脱法国的控制，因为当地的民族运动的力量已更加活跃。我们已能发展一个印度支那战场，老挝和柬埔寨将在这个战场上和越南一样胜利地作战。
    从军事观点来说，法帝国主义者在利用雇佣部队方面应该已得到许多痛苦的教训。数以千计的征募的越南兵，已变成反过来打法帝国主义自己的工具。法国的战略家们曾把他们扑灭越南革命军队的希望寄托在这些雇佣兵身上。
    今天，业已在望的胜利的信心，正鼓舞着越南人民对压迫者的仇恨。今天，我们已有力量对装备良好的法国军队发动全面反攻。事实上，我们计划中的总反攻，已部分地在某些地区开始了。
    目前，越南人民解放军遍于各地，无论是敌人的周围和敌人控制下的城市与乡村。团结在胡志明主席周围的全体人民，决心一举永远消灭法国侵略者。整个民主世界和所有被压迫的各国人民，正注视着我们胜利的战斗。
    我们坚决作战到底。我们要为数以万计的被敌人侮辱、折磨和大批屠杀的男女同胞复仇。我们不仅是为恢复我们自己人民的自由与幸福而战，而且这也有助于解放法兰西被迫的人民及法兰西联邦和全世界各国被压迫的人民。越南人民和其他印度支那人民的胜利，将使世界和平的胜利跃进一步。
    一九四九年冬天将决定法帝国主义者的命运，而一九五○年的春天将告诉我们：“迎接胜利”！
