　　Zhejiang Cotton Company
　　Directly Purchases Lint to Protect Cotton Farmers' Interests
　　[This newspaper's report] The Zhejiang Cotton Company, with the goal of safeguarding the due interests of cotton farmers and meeting the raw cotton needs of public and private yarn factories, is carrying out cotton purchasing operations. As of November 23rd, the total amount of lint purchased has reached 26,500 dan, equivalent to more than 80,000 dan of seed cotton. Among these, 14,000 dan of lint, equivalent to 42,000 dan of seed cotton, have been transported to Shanghai to supply industrial raw materials. In the process of purchasing cotton, the Cotton Company has continuously struggled against exploitative middlemen, enabling the purchasing work to proceed smoothly. When the company first started purchasing, it was often deceived by middlemen. Later, after staff members went to the producing areas, closely cooperated with cotton farmers to understand the situation, and directly purchased from cotton farmers, the exploitation by merchants was reduced, and the interests of cotton farmers were protected. The cotton farmers said in unison: "Since the Cotton Company came, we have eaten a lot more rice!" The company's purchases through affiliated ginning mills accounted for 50%, direct purchases accounted for 35%, and purchases through middlemen accounted for only 15%.
　　The company's purchasing work not only protected the interests of cotton farmers, but also ensured that the quality of the purchased cotton met the established standards.

　　浙江棉业公司
    保障棉农利益直接收购皮棉
    【本报讯】浙江棉业公司在维护棉农应得利益，及供应公私纱厂原棉需要的目标下，进行收购棉花业务。截至十一月二十三日为止，总共收购皮棉已达二万六千五百担，折合籽花有八万担之多。其中已运上海供应工业原料的皮棉，共为一万四千担，折合籽花达四万二千担。棉业公司在收购棉花中曾不断与中间剥削商人进行斗争，使收购工作得顺利进行。该公司开始办理收购的时候，还时常遭受到中间商人的蒙蔽，后在工作人员亲赴产区与棉农密切合作了解情况之后，直接向棉农收购，减少了商人剥削，保护了棉农利益。棉农们异口同声的说道：“棉业公司来到之后，我们多吃了好多米啊！”该公司通过所属轧花厂收购者占百分之五十，自己收购占百分之三十五，通过中间商收购仅占百分之十五。
    该公司的收购工作，不仅保障了棉农的利益，且收购棉花的品质，又都能符合订定标准。
