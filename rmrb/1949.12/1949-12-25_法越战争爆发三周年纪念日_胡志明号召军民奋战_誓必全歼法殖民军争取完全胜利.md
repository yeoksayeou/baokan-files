　　Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam Dispatch via Vietnam News Agency: "The Voice of Vietnam" broadcast on the third anniversary of the outbreak of the French-Vietnamese War (December 19th) a letter from Ho Chi Minh, President of the Republic of Vietnam, to the Vietnamese military and civilians. In the letter, President Ho Chi Minh affirmed: "Vietnam will continue to fight until all French colonial troops are annihilated, until complete victory, thereby restoring the country's true unity and independence." The letter to the people declared: "Since the French colonialists launched the war of aggression against Vietnam, French cabinets have fallen several times, many French military and political leaders stationed in Vietnam have been replaced or recalled, and France has spent hundreds of billions of francs and suffered countless French soldier casualties. French troops are being squeezed by our troops into a few cities or difficult-to-attack communication lines. As for those French lackeys, Bao Dai, Nguyen Van Xuan, and other traitors, they are waiting behind their masters' bayonets to die with their masters, and their fate will be the same as that of Wang Jingwei, Pétain, and Laval."

　　President Ho Chi Minh warned other Vietnamese who work for the French or serve in the French army: "There are only two paths for you to choose. One is that you remain unrepentant and follow the invaders to the death, and your names will be recorded in history as incorrigible traitors. The other is that you immediately surrender, return to the embrace of the motherland, and make up for past mistakes with new actions. This is the only and most glorious way to save yourselves. You must choose one of these two."

　　President Ho Chi Minh analyzed the current situation in Vietnam, saying: "Today, the French aggressors are much weaker than they were three years ago, while we have become three or four times stronger than in the past, and our chances of winning victory have therefore increased. The French colonialists are sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire, and they are therefore trying their best to seek help from international reactionaries. We are full of confidence in our final victory because we are growing stronger day by day, because the world's democratic movement is growing stronger day by day, and the complete victory of the People's Republic of China proves this."

　　President Ho Chi Minh called on the people of Vietnam to work hard to overcome any great difficulties that are bound to exist in the final stage of the victorious struggle. He expressed "heartfelt thanks to the individuals and people of all friendly countries who have taken a noble stance on Vietnam." He especially thanked the French democratic groups who have struggled in the past and are still struggling to make the French government end its war of aggression against Vietnam.

　　President Ho Chi Minh continued: "We, on behalf of the government, army, and people of Vietnam, solemnly declare to the world: The war of aggression is still going on, and the French colonialists should bear full responsibility for this. The Vietnamese people are willing to cooperate with the people of France and the world, but they will never allow themselves to be enslaved again. Vietnam will continue to fight until the last French colonial soldier is eliminated, until true national independence and unity are restored due to the complete victory of the war."

　　President Ho Chi Minh concluded: "In these days, we will celebrate the birth of our liberation army, who fought on the front lines of our August Revolution and have now become our heroic and victorious national army. We must learn from their example and do everything in our power to accelerate the arrival of the day of our general counter-offensive, the arrival of this day, which will rebuild Vietnam, eliminate the French aggressors, and lead us to victory, to our true independence and unity."

　　法越战争爆发三周年纪念日
    胡志明号召军民奋战
    誓必全歼法殖民军争取完全胜利
    【新华社北京二十三日电】越南通讯社北越讯：“越南之声”于法越战争爆发三周年纪念日（十二月十九日）广播越南共和国主席胡志明的告越南军民书。胡志明主席在告军民书中肯定地说：“越南将继续战斗，直到全部歼灭法国殖民军，直到完全胜利，从而恢复国家的真正统一与独立为止。”告人民书宣称：“自从法国殖民主义者发动侵略越南的战争以来，法国的内阁已倒台数次，许多驻越南的法国军政首领已被撤换或奉召回国，法国已消耗了数以千亿计的法郎，伤亡的法国士兵数以计。法国部队正被我们的部队挤到少数的城市里或不易进攻的交通线上。对那些法国走狗保大、阮文春和其他卖国贼来说，他们正在他们主子的刺刀背后等待与其主子一同死亡，他们的命运将和汪精卫、贝当及赖伐尔等的命运一样。”
    胡志明主席警告那些为法国人工作或在法军中服务的其他越南人说：“只有两条道路供你们选择。一条是你们至死不悟追随着侵略者，你们的名字就会作为怙恶不悛的卖国贼记入史册，或者是你们立即投诚，回到祖国的怀抱，以新的行动弥补过去的错误。这乃是挽救你们自己的唯一而最光荣的道路。你们必须在这二者之间选择一条。”
    胡志明主席分析目前的越南形势说：“今天的法国侵略者已经比三年前削弱了很多，而我们已比过去壮大了三、四倍，我们赢得胜利的机会也因而增加了。法国殖民主义者在泥沼中愈陷愈深，他们因此竭力想从国际反动派方面寻求帮助。我们对我们的最后胜利充满信心，因为我们正在一天比一天壮大，因为世界的民主运动正在一天比一天强大，中华人民共和国的完全胜利就证明了这一点。”
    胡志明主席号召越南全国人民努力克服任何胜利斗争的最后阶段内一定会有的巨大困难。他对“那些对越南采取崇高立场的各友好国家的个人与人民致衷心的谢意”。他特别感谢那些过去和现在一直在为使法国政府结束其对越南的侵略战争而进行斗争的法国民主团体。
    胡志明主席继续说：“我们代表越南的政府、军队和人民向世界正式宣布：侵略战争直到现在还在进行，法国殖民者应该对此负全部责任。越南人民愿与法国及全世界的人民合作，但是，他们将永不使自己再被奴役。越南将继续战斗，直到消灭最后一个法国殖民军士兵，直到真正的国家独立与统一由于战争的完全胜利而恢复为止。”
    胡志明主席最后说：“在这几天内，我们将庆祝我们解放军的诞生，他们曾在我们八月革命的前线作战而现在已成为我们英勇的和胜利的国家军队。我们必须学习他们的榜样和尽一切力量加速我们总反攻时日的到来，这个时日的到来，将自整修越南消灭法国侵略者，领导我们走向胜利，走向我们的真正独立与统一。”
