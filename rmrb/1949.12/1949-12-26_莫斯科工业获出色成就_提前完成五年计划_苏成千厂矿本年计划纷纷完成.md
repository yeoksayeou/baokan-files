Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th: TASS, Moscow, December 23rd: Thousands of Soviet manufacturing plants, factories, mines, and construction sites have reported the early completion of their annual plans. The industries of several of the Soviet Union's largest industrial centers—Moscow, Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, etc.—have achieved outstanding successes. Moscow industry, in less than four years, has already completed the post-war five-year plan in terms of total production. Some Moscow factories that have not yet completed the five-year plan have also begun production for 1950. Workers at the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant completed the 1949 plan on the 21st. Dozens of mines in the Donets, Kuznetsk, Urals, Far East, and Moscow coalfields have all completed the fourth year of the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule. Of particular note are the achievements of the Kuznetsk coal miners, as all mines in this region have completed this year's plan. The power generation of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station has exceeded this year's plan by 13 percent.

The brilliant achievements of the socialist competition to celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday are evident everywhere: In the Sverdlovsk Oblast, more than 500 factories have completed their annual plans; in Riga, 250; and in Barnaul, more than 40 have completed this year's plan. Ten work departments of the Red October Factory in Stalingrad, as well as the construction organizations under it, are now producing according to their 1950 plans. The final week of 1949 will bring new economic achievements.

    苏成千厂矿本年计划纷纷完成
    【新华社北京二十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：苏联成千的制造厂、工厂、矿坑及建筑场所，已纷纷报告一年计划已提前完成。苏联若干最大的工业中心——莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克等地的工业，已获得出色的成就。莫斯科工业在不到四年的期间，在总生产量上业已完成战后五年计划。莫斯科某些尚未完成五年计划的工厂，也已开始进行一九五○年的生产。库兹涅茨克钢铁厂的工人们，在二十一日就完成了一九四九年的计划。顿尼兹、库兹涅茨克、乌拉尔、远东、莫斯科等煤田的数十个矿坑，都提前完成了战后五年计划的第四年计划。特别值得注意的，是库兹涅茨克煤矿工人的成绩，这一地区的所有矿坑，都已完成了今年计划。德聂泊水力发电站的发电量，已超过今年计划的百分之十三。
    为庆贺斯大林七十寿辰的社会主义竞赛的辉煌成绩，到处皆是：在斯维德洛夫斯克州，有五百余家工厂完成了一年计划；在里加，有二百五十家；在巴尔瑙尔有四十余家完成了今年计划。在斯大林格勒红十月工厂的十个工作部门以及该夺的建设组织中，现正在按照它们一九五零年的计划进行生产。一九四九年的最后一周，将带来新的经济上的成就。
