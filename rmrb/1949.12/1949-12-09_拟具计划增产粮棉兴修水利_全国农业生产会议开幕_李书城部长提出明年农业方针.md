Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th. The National Agricultural Production Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government opened in Beijing this morning. Attending were more than 230 individuals, including responsible persons and experts/professors in agriculture from the Northeast, North China, Northwest, East China, Central South, and Southwest Major Administrative Areas, as well as various provinces.

The conference was opened with a speech by Minister of Agriculture Li Shucheng. Minister Li pointed out that China's agricultural economy currently accounts for 80 to 90 percent of the entire economy. Restoring and developing the agricultural economy is an extremely important issue at present.

After analyzing the favorable conditions and possible difficulties in agricultural production in 1950, Minister Li proposed the guiding principle for the agricultural production movement in 1950: primarily restoration, striving for improvement under possible conditions. He said: It is hoped that the output in the old liberated areas will generally increase by 10% compared to this year; areas with better conditions should strive to restore to pre-war production levels. New liberated areas are required to maintain the production level of 1949; areas with better conditions should strive for a slight increase. Minister Li said: In 1949, the estimated national grain harvest was only 212.5 billion catties, a quarter lower than before the Anti-Japanese War. In 1950, we hope that the output in the old liberated areas will increase by 10%, which is an increase of 10 billion catties. The total cotton production in 1949 was approximately 8.3 million piculs, a decrease of 42% compared to before the Anti-Japanese War. We hope to increase production to 13 million piculs in 1950. He said: This is our extremely arduous and must-be-achieved great task.

Minister Li put forward the following specific tasks for this conference: First, based on the plans and opinions of local governments, formulate a relatively specific and appropriate plan for national agricultural production in 1950; Second, study various specific measures to implement the plan; Third, according to the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, this conference should focus on resolving the increase in grain and cotton production and the construction of water conservancy projects.

Subsequently, Vice Premier Huang Yanpei of the Government Administration Council delivered a speech. Vice Premier Huang pointed out that the inability of China's agricultural production to improve in the past was due to the corruption and incompetence of the previous rulers. Now that the people have organized their own government, which has formulated various good policies that are in the interests of the people, it is hoped that all agricultural workers will strive to implement these policies and serve the peasants wholeheartedly.

Also speaking at today's meeting were Minister of Forestry and Land Reclamation Liang Xi, Director of the Planning Bureau of the Financial and Economic Committee Song Shaowen, Director of the Central Cooperative Administration Bureau of the Financial and Economic Committee Meng Yongqian, President of the Agricultural College of North China University Le Tianyu, cotton expert Sun Enlin, insect pest expert Liu Chongle, agricultural economics expert Zhang Xin, President of the Agricultural College of Nanjing University Jin Shanbao, water conservancy expert Li Piji, and others.

　　拟具计划增产粮棉兴修水利
  　全国农业生产会议开幕
    李书城部长提出明年农业方针
    【新华社北京八日电】中央人民政府农业部召开的全国农业生产会议今日上午在京开幕。出席的有东北、华北、西北、华东、中南、西南各大行政区及各省农业方面的负责人和专家、教授等共二百三十余人。
    会议由农业部部长李书城致开幕词。李部长指出：中国目前农业经济占整个经济比重的百分之八十到九十。恢复和发展农业经济，在当前是极其重要的问题。
    李部长在分析了一九五○年农业生产的有利条件和可能发生的困难之后，提出一九五○年农业生产运动的方针是：以恢复为主，在可能条件下争取提高。他说：希望老区明年产量一般地比今年提高一成；条件较好的地区，争取恢复战前的生产水平。新区则要求保持一九四九年的生产水平；条件较好的地区，争取略加提高，李部长说：一九四九年全国估计仅收粮食二、一二五亿斤，比抗日战争前降低四分之一。一九五○年希望老区产量增加一成，就是增产一百亿斤。一九四九年棉花总产量约八三○万市担，较抗日战争前减少百分之四十二，希望一九五○年增产到一、三○○万市担。他说：这就是我们极其艰巨而必须达成的伟大任务。
    李部长提出这次会议的具体任务如下：第一、依据各地方政府的计划和意见，拟定一个一九五○年全国农业生产的比较具体和恰当的计划；第二、研究贯彻计划的各种具体措施；第三、根据政务院财经委员会的指示，这次会议应以解决食粮与棉花的增产和兴修水利为中心。
    接着由政务院副总理黄炎培讲话。黄副总理指出：过去中国农业生产之不能改进，乃是由于过去的当政者腐败无能所致。现在人民已经组织了自己的政府，这个政府已规定了各种符合人民利益的良好政策，希望全体农业工作者努力贯彻这些政策，全心全意地为农民服务。
    今日在会议上讲话的还有林垦部部长梁希、财经委员会计划局局长宋劭文、财经委员会中央合作管理局局长孟用潜、华北大学农学院长乐天宇、棉作专家孙恩麟、虫害专家刘崇乐、农业经济专家张心一、南京大学农学院长金善宝、水利专家李丕济等。
