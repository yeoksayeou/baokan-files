We thank you for expressing your confidence in us, and we will prove that this confidence is well-placed. We oppose all those who slander the Soviet Union, and we will do everything in our power to ensure that the great Soviet Union and a peace-loving, unified Germany remain friends forever." The letter was signed by employees of the Deutsche Werft and Howaldtswerke shipyards in Hamburg.
