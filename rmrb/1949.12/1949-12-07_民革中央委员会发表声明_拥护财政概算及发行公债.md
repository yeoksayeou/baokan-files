　　RCCK Central Committee Issues Statement
　　Endorsing Fiscal Budget and Issuance of Public Bonds
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a statement endorsing the "1950 National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budget" and the "Decision on Issuing People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds." The full text is as follows:
　　The fourth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee passed the "1950 National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budget" and the "Decision on Issuing People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds." These two items are interrelated. As Chairman Mao said, the national budget reflects the entire national policy because it stipulates the scope and direction of government activities. The 1950 National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budget correctly identifies the main tasks of the government in this year, and after a practical review of the crux of the current financial and economic problems, it clearly indicates that issuing People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds is an important countermeasure to overcome the financial difficulties of this year. Therefore, these two items indicate that a correct fiscal policy is subordinate to correct political tasks, and a correct fiscal policy is leading a sound economic policy to move forward. Such a policy will inevitably gain the enthusiastic support of the people across the country.
　　Striving for and ensuring the final victory of the People's Liberation War and consolidating the fruits of the victory of the People's Liberation War are the main political tasks at present. Thanks to the heroic and invincible People's Liberation Army, the remaining forces of the Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs are rapidly collapsing, and the liberation of the whole country is just around the corner. In the process of victorious development, various emergency expenditures are forcing the increase of the fiscal deficit. These increases in expenditure are inevitable and necessary because they are the expenses that the government's established, far-sighted, and wise policy must bear, and they are also the expenses necessary for healing wounds and restoring production. Some of these expenses, at first glance, may seem to be purely consumptive; but in the long run, they are all constructive. We should endure the pain of these burdens in order to promote the great development of our economic construction.
　　The crisis of fiscal deficits often leads to the crisis of currency inflation. In 1949, we had several price fluctuations. Although this situation has gradually improved due to the gradual recovery of production in the liberated areas and the expansion of the area where banknotes are used, and is absolutely different in nature from the currency crisis during the decline and collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary government, reducing issuance and stabilizing prices are still tasks that the people and the government cannot ignore at all times.
　　The decision on issuing People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds is precisely the method by which the Central People's Government, in order to eliminate the currency crisis, make up for the fiscal deficit, and stabilize prices, borrows the people's surplus purchasing power to achieve this goal. This method is beneficial and harmless because the bonds to be issued in this method have many excellent qualities: First, the comprehensive real value unit is based on the people's basic necessities of life, so that purchasers can maintain the value of the currency. Secondly, the bond units are not large, and the interest is also calculated in kind, which is relatively generous, and can attract small amounts of idle funds into legitimate uses. Third, the total amount of public bonds is not large, which fully demonstrates the People's Government's realistic and responsible work style. Finally, the redemption of public bonds places greater hope on urban citizens, and is relatively fair in comparing the contributions of urban and rural people to the Liberation War. In summary, the issuance of People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds accurately conforms to the principle of "mutual benefit for both public and private interests." We fully endorse this decision of the Central People's Government Committee and are willing to work together with the people across the country to respond to the government's call to overcome property difficulties and strive for price stability.

### 民革中央委员会发表声明　拥护财政概算及发行公债

　　民革中央委员会发表声明
  　拥护财政概算及发行公债
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会拥护“一九五零年度全国财政收支概算”及“发行人民胜利折实公债”的声明，全文如下：
    中央人民政府委员会第四次会议，通过了“一九五零年度全国财政收支概算”及“关于发行人民胜利折实公债的决定”。这两项案件是相互关联的。正如毛主席所说，国家的预算反映着整个国家的政策，因为它规定了政府活动的范围和方向。一九五零年度全国财政收支概算正确的标明了这一年度中政府的主要工作任务，而在切实的检讨了当前财政经济问题的症结之后，又明确的指示出发行人民胜利折实公债为克服本年度财政难关重要对策的一种。因此，这两项案件表示，正确的财政政策是服从于正确的政治任务的，而正确的财政政策也正领导着一个健全的经济政策向前发展。这样的政策必然会获得全国人民热烈的拥护。
    争取并保证人民解放战争的最后胜利和巩固人民解放战争胜利的成果，是当前主要的政治任务。由于人民解放军的英勇无敌，蒋李白匪帮的残余力量正在迅速地土崩瓦解，全国解放已经是指日可期了。在胜利发展的过程中，各项紧急支出催迫着财政赤字的增加。这些支出的增加是必然的，也是必需的。因为这是政府既定的富有远见而英明的政策所必需负担的费用，也是疗治创伤恢复生产所必需的费用。这些费用的一部分，在一时看来，也许是属于纯消费性的；而从长期看来，则都是建设性的。我们应该忍受这些负担的痛苦，以促成我们经济建设的巨大发展。
    财政赤字的危机往往召来货币膨胀的危机。在一九四九年度，我们曾有几度的物价波动。这种情形虽然因为解放区生产逐渐恢复与纸币使用区域扩大而渐次改善，与国民党反动政府在没落崩溃过程中的货币危机在本质上绝对不同，但是，减少发行，稳定物价，仍为人民与政府时刻不容忽视的任务。
    关于发行人民胜利折实公债的决定，正是中央人民政府为了消除货币危机，弥补财政赤字，稳定物价而借用人民剩余购买力来达到这一目的底方法。这个方法是有利无弊的，因为这方法中所拟发行的债券具备了许多优良的物质：第一，以人民基本生活必需品为综合折实单位，使购买者可以保持币值。其次，债券单位不大，利息亦以实物计算，比较优厚，可以吸引小额游资入于正当用途。第三，公债总额不多，充分表现了人民政府实事求是与负责任的作风。最后，公债消纳寄托较大希望于城市市民，比较城市人民与农村人民对于解放战争的贡献，也是十公公平的。总结说来，人民胜利折实公债的发行，确切地符合着“公私两利”的原则，我们完全拥护中央人民政府委员会的这一决定，并愿与全国人民一致为响应政府战胜财产困难与争取物价稳定的号召而奋斗。
