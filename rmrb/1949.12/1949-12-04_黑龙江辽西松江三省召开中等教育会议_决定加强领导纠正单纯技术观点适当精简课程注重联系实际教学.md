The Three Provinces of Heilongjiang, Liaoxi, and Songjiang
Convene Secondary Education Conference
Decide to Strengthen Leadership, Correct Purely Technical Viewpoints, Appropriately Streamline Curriculum, Emphasize Connecting Teaching with Practical Reality

[Northeast News] In order to consolidate and improve secondary education, the three provinces of Heilongjiang, Liaoxi, and Songjiang have successively convened education conferences to discuss future teaching, staff learning, school leadership, and other issues.

The Third Heilongjiang Provincial Education Conference's summary pointed out: In order to prepare to welcome the high tide of cultural construction, first and foremost, ideological education must be strengthened. It is necessary to correct the more or less existing purely technical viewpoints among teachers and students, and the mechanical and one-sided understanding of education serving production. For example, considering history, geography, music, and physical education to be irrelevant to production; believing that increasing students' labor and social activity time equates to good integration with production; regarding direct participation in production as serving production construction, and education work not as serving production construction. Regarding the issue of improving teaching, the summary believes: Only by streamlining unnecessary courses and improving teaching can the quality of teaching be improved. For example, the content of middle school courses should be appropriately streamlined (but can be appropriately supplemented when necessary), and the number of lessons should be reduced. The teaching progress should adhere to the principle of "seeking speed in thoroughness," and be steady and solid. In terms of teachers, they must first prepare their lessons well and create "lesson plans." Teaching methods should be flexible, lively, and connected to reality, opposing purely imparting methods: making more use of object teaching, expanding the scope of the classroom to factories, rural areas, society, and nature. At the same time, mobilize and create instruments and specimens, and organize demonstration teaching in an organized and led manner.

As for the learning regulations for teachers, the main focus is on learning political theory and professional skills, ensuring two hours of study every day. The content of study includes basic theory and current affairs policies, scientific knowledge of the subjects they teach and research on teaching materials and methods, and research on policies, laws, instructions, and decisions related to education work. The learning method should be mainly self-study, with discussions held periodically. In addition, regarding leadership issues, it is also stipulated that middle schools implement a grade-level teacher system.

The Liaoxi Provincial Secondary Education Conference pointed out that in order to strengthen school leadership and improve the quality of teaching, it is necessary to first strengthen students' ideological education, and second, to strengthen cultural education, stipulating that class time should not exceed thirty hours per week for junior high schools and thirty-two hours per week for senior high schools, and reduce unnecessary extracurricular activities and meetings, so that students have ample time for self-study.

The Songjiang Provincial Secondary School Principals Conference's summary pointed out: In terms of teaching ideology and methods, in addition to emphasizing learning from the Soviet Union, efforts should also be made in the direction of combining theory with practice, culture with politics, and consistency between knowledge and action, paying attention to object-based, experimental, and visual teaching methods. Students' extracurricular activities and organizations should be suitable for the needs of teaching, and it was proposed to establish a strict system of principal responsibility.

　　黑龙江辽西松江三省
    召开中等教育会议
    决定加强领导纠正单纯技术观点适当精简课程注重联系实际教学
    【东北讯】为了巩固和提高中等教育，黑龙江、辽西、松江三省先后召开教育会议，讨论今后的教学、教职员学习、学校领导等问题。
    黑龙江省第三次教育会议总结指出：为了准备迎接文化建设的高潮，首先要加强思想教育，必须纠正教员与学生中或多或少的存在着的单纯技术观点，对教育为生产服务的机械片面的了解。如认为史地、音乐、体育科与生产无关；多增加学生劳动和社会活动时间，就是和生产结合得好；直接参加生产才是为生产建设服务，教育工作就不是为生产建设服务。关于提高教学问题，总结认为：只有精简不必要的课程，改进教学，才能提高教学质量。如中学课程内容应酌量精简（但必要时可作适当补充），授课间要减少。教学进度要本“透中求快”原则，稳扎稳打。在教员方面，首先要好好准备功课，制作“教案”。教学方法要灵活、生动、结合实际，反对单纯注入的方法：多利用实物教学，把课堂范围扩大到工厂、农村、社会、大自然中去。同时，自己动用创造仪器、标本，有组织有领导的组织观摩教学。
    至于教员的学习规定主要学习政治理论和业务，保证每天学习二小时。学习内容为基本理论和时事政策，自己所教课目的科学知识及教材、教学方法的研究，教育工作的政策法令、指示决定的研究等。学习方法以自学为主，可按期讨论。此外，关于领导问题亦规定中学实行级任制。
    辽西省中等教育会议中指出为了加强学校领导，提高教学质量，首先要加强学生之思想教育，其次是加强文化教育，规定上课时间初中每周不得超过三十小时，高中不得超过三十二小时，并减少不必要的课外活动和会议，使学生有充分的自习时间。
    松江省中等学校校长会议总结指出：在教学思想和方法上，除强调向苏联学习外，并应向着理论与实践结合、文化与政治结合、认识与行动一致的方向努力，注重实物、实验、形象教学法，学生课外活动和组织应当适合教学的要求，并提出建立严格的校长负责制。
