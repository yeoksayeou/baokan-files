　　The meeting of the Central People's Government Committee held on December 2nd was an extremely important meeting. This meeting analyzed the causes, nature, and prospects of price increases in 1949, and stipulated a concrete plan to strive for price stability, namely the 1950 annual budget of revenues and expenditures and the method of issuing the People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds. The price issue is a matter of urgent concern to the people of the whole country. After this meeting, we believe that the people of the whole country will be able to work together to ensure the realization of the 1950 annual budget of revenues and expenditures and the completion of the bond issuance plan, so as to overcome financial difficulties and strive for price stability.
    In 1949, there were three major price increases: one in April, one in July, and one in November. These three price increases had a great impact on the lives of the frontline troops and the people of the whole country. People who did not understand the reasons for the price increases therefore developed doubts. They asked: In 1949, almost the entire mainland of China was liberated, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was convened, the Central People's Government was established, and diplomatic relations were established with ten countries including the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Mongolia, Germany, and Albania. Military, domestic, and foreign affairs have all been smooth. Why are there still large price fluctuations? In the Kuomintang era, prices rose, and after the Communist Party came, prices still rose. What is the difference between the two parties in this regard? These questions have already been clearly answered in the report by Vice Premier Chen Yun at the meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. The several price increases in 1949 were an inevitable byproduct of the great military victory. The fundamental reason was the sharp increase in national expenditures, while national income was yet to be restored. The inability to make ends meet had to be temporarily compensated by issuing a large amount of banknotes, which inevitably led to a decline in currency value. However, this difficult phenomenon of not being able to make ends meet, relying on issuance, leading to currency depreciation and price increases is completely temporary and can be overcome. Therefore, this is only a difficulty in the process of victory, and it is completely different from the difficulties in the process of the demise of the Kuomintang reactionary government. All pessimistic ideas about financial and price issues are unfounded.
    Why has national expenditure increased sharply? This is because the People's Liberation Army has expanded, this is because a large number of military, government, public, and educational personnel formerly belonging to the Kuomintang government have been taken over, this is because destroyed production and transportation have begun to recover, and this is because other government affairs that the country urgently needs to carry out have been carried out. All of these are major events and good things that are related to the fundamental interests of the people. However, national income cannot increase as quickly or as greatly. Many incomes are temporarily stagnant. The tax revenue in the cities and rural areas of the newly liberated areas is either stagnant due to war and blockade, and needs to be reorganized and restored, or is restricted by the season and cannot be collected temporarily. Investments in restoring production and restoring transportation cannot recover costs in the short term, let alone make profits. In the process of victorious development, the increase in expenditure is inevitable, and the temporary decrease in income is also inevitable. Therefore, fundamentally speaking, financial difficulties are a temporarily unavoidable phenomenon.
    But this difficulty can only be temporary. Why? Because fiscal revenues are bound to increase gradually. And some fiscal expenditures are bound to decrease gradually, and this is also inevitable. Fiscal revenues are bound to increase because both rural and urban tax revenues will return to normal, and with the development and completion of land reform, and with the recovery of industry, transportation and domestic and foreign trade, both of these tax revenues will have a natural and appropriate increase. At the same time, the state's investment in restoring industry and transportation will gradually generate profits. On the negative side, with the victorious completion of the People's Liberation War, the state's military expenditure will gradually decrease. Today, some of the military, government, public and educational personnel who are detached from production will be completely transferred to production, and some will engage in amateur production. All these changes in the state's revenue and expenditure situation are inevitable, and some have already begun to be prepared. They will begin to be implemented around the second half of 1950, and major changes will take place in 1951. The result of this transformation will inevitably be the balance of state revenue and expenditure. Therefore, the current phenomenon of not being able to make ends meet and relying on the issuance of banknotes to make up for fiscal expenditure can only be temporary.
    From this it can be seen that the difficult phenomena of currency depreciation and price increases in 1949 have their inevitability, and we can overcome this difficulty also has inevitability. We must admit the difficulties, but at the same time we must oppose pessimistic views in the face of difficulties.
    In the struggle to overcome financial difficulties and strive for price stability, 1950 is a key year. In 1950, the war has not yet completely ended, and the expenditure of military expenses and the living expenses of military, government, public and educational personnel throughout the country will exceed 1949 due to the liberation of the southwest (including Tibet) and Taiwan, Hainan Island and other places to accommodate a large number of Kuomintang military, government, public and educational personnel. In 1950, the People's Liberation Army will reach more than five million, and administrative public and educational personnel will reach more than three million, totaling nine million. And in 1950, generally speaking, we can only plan and prepare for demobilization and transfer, and cannot immediately demobilize and transfer in large quantities. And to accommodate a large number of Kuomintang military, government, public and educational personnel, so as not to be displaced and cause social unrest, is the established policy of the Central People's Government, and it is a smart policy that has more advantages than disadvantages. Therefore, 1950 is still a year of financial difficulties. Only after overcoming the difficulties of 1950 will it be possible to strive for a long-term stability of fiscal revenue and expenditure and currency prices thereafter. For this purpose, it is necessary to increase the income that can be increased in 1950 and reduce the expenditure that can be reduced. The decision of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2 on the 1950 annual budget of revenues and expenditures and the issuance of the People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds is a victorious call for the Central People's Government to lead the people of the whole country to overcome the financial difficulties of 1950 and improve the state's financial and price situation.
    Why is it that by implementing the Central People's Government's decision on the 1950 annual budget of revenues and expenditures and the issuance of the People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds, the state's financial and price situation will definitely be improved? This is because the 1950 annual budget of revenues and expenditures and the method of issuing the People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds are both realistic and have full possibilities for realization. This is because the Central People's Government led by the Communist Party of China and participated by various democratic parties is responsible for realizing the 1950 annual budget of revenues and expenditures. This government is an unprecedented responsible and efficient government in Chinese history. It is loyally supported by the people of the whole country, it is loyally supported by all democratic parties, it is loyally supported by the entire People's Liberation Army, and it is loyally supported by the people's governments at all levels. The people will enthusiastically complete the work of paying taxes (this tax revenue is entirely used for revolutionary war and revolutionary construction) in order to strive for the improvement of the financial and price situation. The people who have the ability to purchase bonds will enthusiastically purchase bonds (this bond is not only beneficial to the country and the entire people, but also beneficial to the purchasers) in order to strive for the improvement of the financial and price situation. All the People's Liberation Army and all public officials will work hard to oppose waste, practice thrift and engage in all possible amateur production in order to reduce the country's expenditure and strive for the improvement of the financial and price situation. The people's governments or military and political committees of the major administrative regions and the people's governments at all levels under their jurisdiction will strictly obey the unified scheduling of the Central People's Government in financial and economic aspects, and hand over all the income that should be handed over to the Central People's Government in order to strive for the improvement of the financial and price situation.
    The meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2 proved that the people's confidence in the Central People's Government is justified. The meeting stipulated the correct method to strive for the improvement of the financial and price situation. The representatives of various democratic parties and democratic classes showed a consensus of opinions on the current financial and economic issues. The responsible leaders of the major administrative regions showed enthusiastic support for the financial and economic measures of the Central People's Government. The experience of the Northeast People's Government announced at the meeting greatly strengthened the belief of the people of the whole country in the bright future of the new China. The Northeast Liberation War had only ended for a year, but the prices in the Northeast in 1949 were so stable that although the currency issuance had a large increase, the annual price only rose by 80%. The industrial construction in the Northeast is rapidly moving towards restoring the pre-war level. This example makes us fully believe that no other place in China, under the leadership of the same Communist Party of China and the Chinese working class, will not be able to find a bright way out in the face of difficulties.
    Chairman Mao Zedong said at the meeting of the Central People's Government Committee: "Our situation can be summarized as: there are difficulties, there are ways, and there is hope." That's absolutely right. China, with its vast territory, abundant resources, large population, and diligence and bravery, is an invincible force that can overcome any difficulty after overthrowing imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries and achieving liberation. Difficulties will pass, and the light is ahead of us. Let the patriotic people of the whole country unite, resolutely implement the call of the Central People's Government, guarantee the realization of the 1950 annual budget of revenues and expenditures, guarantee the completion of the issuance plan of the People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds, and strive to defeat financial difficulties and strive for price stability!

### 战胜财政困难，争取物价稳定！

　　战胜财政困难，争取物价稳定！
    十二月二日所举行的中央人民政府委员会会议，是一次极重要的会议。这个会议分析了一九四九年物价上涨的原因、性质和前途，规定了争取物价稳定的具体方案，即一九五○年度财政收支概算和发行人民胜利折实公债办法。物价问题是全国人民所迫切关心的。在这一次会议以后，我们相信，全国人民必能同心同德，保证实现一九五○年度财政收支概算和完成发行公债计划，借以战胜财政困难，争取物价稳定。
    一九四九年物价有过三次大的上涨：四月一次，七月一次，十一月一次。这三次物价上涨，对于前线军队和全国人民的生活，影响很大。不了解物价上涨原因的人们，因此发生了怀疑。他们问：在一九四九年里，解放了中国的几乎全部大陆，召集了人民政治协商会议，成立了中央人民政府，与苏、保、罗、捷、匈、朝、波、蒙、德、阿等十国建立了外交关系，军事内政外交，无不着着顺利，为什么物价却还有大的波动呢？国民党时代是物价上涨，共产党来了物价仍然上涨，在这一点上两党有什么分别呢？这些疑问，在中央人民政府委员会的会议上，陈云副总理的报告业已明确地答复了。一九四九年的几次物价上涨，是伟大军事胜利的一个不可避免的副产物，其根本原因是国家支出猛烈增加，而国家收入则有待于恢复，入不敷出暂时不能不依靠发行大量钞票来弥补，因而不能不造成币值下跌。但是这种入不敷出、依靠发行、以致币值下跌、物价上涨的困难现象完全是暂时的，完全有办法克服的，因此这只是胜利过程中的困难，与国民党反动政府灭亡过程中的困难完全不同。一切对于财政物价问题的悲观思想，都是没有根据的。
    国家支出为什么猛烈增加呢？这就是因为人民解放军扩大了，这就是因为原属国民党政府的大量军政公教人员被接收了，这就是因为被破坏的生产和交通已经开始恢复了，这就是因为国家所迫切需要进行的其他政务已经进行了。所有这些，都是人民根本利益所关的大事和好事。但是国家收入却不能同样快同样大地增加起来，许多收入暂时还停顿着。新解放区的城市的税收和农村的税收，或者是因为战争和封锁而陷于停顿，需要整理和恢复，或者是受着季节的限制，暂时不能征收。用于恢复生产和恢复交通的投资短期间不能收回成本，更说不上得到利润。在胜利发展的过程中，支出的增加是不可避免的，收入的暂时减少也是不可避免的，因此，从根本上说来，财政困难是一种暂时不可避免的现象。
    但是这种困难只能是暂时的。为什么？因为财政收入是要逐步增加的。而某些财政支出却要逐步减少，这也是必然而不可避免的。财政收入必然要增加，因为无论农村和城市的税收都将要恢复正常状态，而且随着土地改革的发展和完成，随着工业、交通和内外贸易的恢复，这两方面的税收都将有自然的适当的增加。同时，国家用于恢复工业和交通的投资将要逐步取得利润。在反面，随着人民解放战争的胜利完成，国家的军费支出将要逐步减少，今天脱离生产的军政公教人员，将有一部分完全转入生产，一部分进行业余生产。国家收支状这一切转变，都是不可避免的，而且有的已经在开始了准备，大约到一九五○年下半年就要开始实行了，大的转变则将在一九五一年。这种转变的结果必然是国家收支的平衡。因此，今天的入不敷出、依靠发行钞票弥补财政支出的现象，只能是暂时的。
    由此可见，一九四九年的币值下跌、物价上涨的困难现象，有它的必然性，而我们能够战胜这种困难，也有必然性。我们必须承认困难，但是我们必须同时反对在困难面前的悲观观点。
    在战胜财政困难，争取物价稳定的斗争中，一九五○年是一个关键。一九五○年战争还未完全结束，军费的支出和全国军政公教人员的生活费的支出都将因西南（包括西藏）和台湾海南岛等地的解放收容大批国民党军政公教人员而超过一九四九年。一九五○年人民解放军将达到五百余万，行政公教人员将达到三百余万，两者共将达到九百万。而在一九五○年，大体上说来，还只能计划和准备复员和转业，还不能立即大量复员和转业。而收容大量国民党军政公教人员，不使流离失所，引起社会骚乱，则是中央人民政府的既定政策，并且是一个聪明的利多害少的政策，因此一九五○年仍然是财政困难的一年。只在了渡过了一九五○年的困难，就有可能争取此后财政收支的平衡和币值物价的长期稳定。为些目的，必须在一九五○年增加可能增加的收入，减少可能减少的支出。而中央人民政府委员会十二月二日所通过的一九五○年度财政收支概算和发行人民胜利折实公债的决定，便是中央人民政府领导全国人民为克服一九五○年度财政困难并改善国家财政物价状况而进军的必胜的号令。
    为什么执行中央人民政府关于一九五○年度财政收支概算和发行人民胜利折实公债的决定，国家财政和物价状况就一定能够得到改善呢？这是因为，一九五○年度财政收支概算和发行人民胜利折实公债办法都是实事求是的，有实现的充分可能性。这是因为，负责实现一九五○年度财政收支概算的是中国共产党所领导和各民主党派所参加的中央人民政府，这个政府是中国历史上空前未有的负责任有效率的政府，它受到全国人民的忠心支持，它受到一切民主党派的忠心支持，它受到全体人民解放军的忠心支持，它受到各级地方人民政府的忠心支持。人民将要踊跃完成纳税的工作（这种税收是完全用于革命战争和革命建设的），以便争取财政和物价状况的好转。有购买公债能力的人民，将要踊跃购买公债（这种公债是不但对国家对全体人民有利，就对购买者也是有利的），以便争取财政和物价状况的好转。全体人民解放军和全体公职人员将要努力反对浪费，厉行节约和进行一切可能的业余生产，借以减少国家的开支，以便争取财政和物价状况的好转。各大行政区人民政府或军政委员会及其所属的各级人民政府将要严格服从中央人民政府在财政经济方面的统一调度，并向中央人民政府上解一切应当上解的收入，以便争取财政和物价状况的好转。
    中央人民政府委员会十二月二日的会议，证明了人民对于中央人民政府的信心是有理由的。会议规定了争取财政和物价状况好转的正确办法。各民主党派各民主阶级的代表们表现了对于当前财政经济问题的意见一致。各大行政区的负责领导人表现了对于中央人民政府财政经济措施的热烈拥护。在会议上宣布的东北人民政府的经验，极大地加强了全国人民对于新中国光明前途的信念。东北解放战争才结束了一年，但是东北一九四九年的物价就如此稳定，以致通货发行虽有大的增加，全年物价却只上涨了百分之八十。东北的工业建设正向恢复战前水平迅速迈进。这个榜样使我们完全相信，全中国任何其他地方，在同一个中国共产党和中国工人阶级领导之下，决不会在困难面前找不到光明的出路。
    毛泽东主席在中内人民政府委员会的会议上说：“我们的情况概括地说来就是：有困难的，有办法的，有希望的。”完全不错。地大物博，人民众多，而又勤劳和勇敢的中国，在打倒了帝国主义和国民党反动派，获得了解放以后，是一个能够战胜任何困难的无敌的力量。困难将要过去，光明在我们前面。让全国爱国人民团结一致，坚决地执行中央人民政府的号召，保证一九五○年度财政收支概算的实现，保证人民胜利折实公债发行计划的完成，为打倒财政困难，争取物价稳定而奋斗！
