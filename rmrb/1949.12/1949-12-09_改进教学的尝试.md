　　Attempts to Improve Teaching
　　Qinghua Correspondence Group
　　During the summer vacation, many students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University went to the Northeast for internships. They witnessed the laboring people restoring and developing industry under the leadership of the Communist Party, saw the rich resources of the motherland, and became more confident in the inevitable victory of the motherland's construction. They also resolved the worries of "unemployment upon graduation." The only question was "how to learn more practically." We also saw that some old technicians could not perform their work very well, which strengthened our demand for political study. Shortly after returning from the Northeast, the new China was officially born. Chairman Mao declared that the Chinese people had stood up forever. Our teachers and students were enthusiastically preparing to welcome the high tide of the motherland's construction and more clearly proposed to "help each other between teachers and students and learn from each other" to do a good job in New Democracy's study. At the same time, political classes also began, and that's how we entered the new semester.

　　Since the beginning of the semester, professors have tried their best to "combine with China's actual situation" in teaching content. Professor Wang Zunming taught "Steel and Steel Heat Treatment." In the past, the reference books were American; when talking about the composition of iron, it was either from the Great Lakes region or New York State; when talking about iron smelting methods, they were only suitable for the United States. Since returning from the Northeast, coupled with the problems we raised during the summer internship, the lecture style of this semester has changed. For example, when talking about the chapter on steelmaking, he first pointed out that most of China's iron ore is lean ore, containing only 30% iron, which must be enriched to turn the lean ore into rich ore before being sent to the blast furnace. He also carefully explained the principle and procedure of reduction roasting (enrichment method) and cited Anshan Iron and Steel Company as an example, which left a deep impression on the students. When teaching automobile engineering, Mr. Song Jingying compared the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States has more cars and fewer trucks, while the Soviet Union is the opposite, with trucks outnumbering those in the US by a factor of thirty. He said, "Our country's future automobile industry should learn from the Soviet Union and build more trucks to help urban and rural exchanges."

　　In terms of combining theory with practice, many teachers are boldly trying to create new forms and are constantly listening to students' opinions and improving them. When Mr. Song Jingying taught automobile engineering, when he taught about cylinders, he taught us to design one according to the actual situation; when he taught about pistons, he took real objects to teach us how to draw them; he used these things as exercises so that we no longer did exercises to cope with the teacher, but to connect the theory in the classroom with real things. Mr. Song also taught internal combustion engines in the third grade. He first asked the students to disassemble the car engine, posted the blueprints in the classroom for the students to look at first, and then lectured on the book, so that the students could easily remember and understand. Mr. Zheng Linqing, who taught manufacturing methods and tool studies, used slides to enlarge the photos to make them clearer since drawing on the blackboard was not easy to understand. When talking about milling cutters and reamers, he put all kinds of milling cutters and reamers in the department library for us to refer to with notes. When talking about the tools used in the automatic lathe cam design, Mr. Zheng made a model with cardboard for us to look at, which made it easier to understand.

　　In terms of mutual help between teachers and students and learning from each other, great efforts have also been made. There are teaching groups in the organization, where teachers and students discuss teaching issues together. In order to understand the students' situation, the teachers actively sought out students to hold seminars, listened to the students' opinions humbly, and took notes seriously. After careful analysis, they helped each student choose a focus according to their wishes. The examination methods also truly achieved the goal of examinations being for summarizing learning. Mr. Song Jingying tried a new method. He taught students to read magazines about steam boilers and used oral exams to check the effect of his teaching and the students' self-study results. For the manufacturing methods exercises, Mr. Zheng Linqing initially required students to read reference books and make reports. The students suggested that this was equivalent to copying books. He immediately changed the method and taught students to study the manufacturing process of actual machine parts, such as what processing processes must be carried out when manufacturing a certain size of gears in large quantities, what tools and machine tools should be used, and what cutting speed and feed rate should be used. This made it easier for students to understand the relationship between the chapters.

　　改进教学的尝试
    清华通讯组
    暑期中清华机械系有很多同学到东北去实习，看到了在共产党领导下劳动人民用自己的力量在恢复和发展工业，看到了祖国丰富的资源，更坚定了对祖国建设必然胜利的信心和解除了“毕业即失业”的苦恼。问题只在“如何学得更实用”。我们又看到有些旧技术员不能很好的进行工作，这加强了我们对政治学习的要求。从东北回来不久，新中国正式诞生，毛主席宣布中国人民从此永远站起来了，我们师生都以热烈的心情准备迎接祖国的建设高潮，更明确的提出了要“师生互助，教学相长”来搞好新民主主义的学习，同时政治课也开始了，就这样我们步入了新的学期。
    开学以来，教授们在教学内容上尽可能的“结合中国实际情况”。王遵明教授教“钢铁及钢铁热处理”，在过去，参考书是美国的；谈到铁的成分，不是五湖区的就是纽约州的；谈到炼铁的方法也只是适合于美国的情况。他自从东北参观回来，再加上我们提出暑假实习所碰到的问题后，本期讲课就改变方式了，如讲到炼钢的一章，先指出中国的铁矿大多是贫矿，含铁仅有百分之三十，须经过富集，把贫矿变为富矿，再送到鼓风炉去，并仔细说明还原焙烧法（富集方法）的原理和手续，并举出了鞍山钢铁公司作为例子，这样，同学便留下一个很深的印象。在上汽车工程时，宋镜瀛先生把美国和苏联做了比较，美国小汽车多，卡车少；而苏联恰恰相反，卡车三十倍于美国。他说：“我国将来汽车工业，要向苏联学习，多造卡车，帮助城乡交流”。
    在理论和实际联系方面，许多先生都在大胆的尝试，创造新的形式，并且随时听取同学的意见，加以改良。宋镜瀛先生在教汽车工程时，教到汽缸，便教我们根据实际情形去设计一个；讲到活塞，便拿实际东西教我们描画；以这些东西当做习题，使我们做习题不再是为了应付先生而做习题，而是要把课堂上的理论去联系实际的东西。三年级的内燃机也是宋先生教，他先让同学去拆汽车引擎，把蓝图贴在教室内让同学先看，然后再讲书，这样同学便容易记住，容易了解。教制造方法及工具学的郑林庆先生，为了补助在黑板上画图不易清楚，就利用幻灯把照片放大来看，讲到铣刀铰刀时，就把各式的铣刀和铰刀放在系图书馆内让我们用笔记对照参看，讲到自动车床凸输设计所用的工具时，郑先生就以硬纸板做个模型，拿给我们看，使更容易明白些。
    在师生互助和教学相长方面，也作了很大的努力。在组织上有教学小组，师生共同讨论教学问题。先生们为了了解同学的情况，主动的找同学开座谈会，虚心的听取同学的意见，认真的记下来，在仔细分析后，就帮助每个同学依照志愿选择重点。在考试方法上也真正做到了考试是为了总结学习。宋镜瀛先生试用了新的方法，他教同学看蒸汽锅炉的杂志，用口试来检查自己教的效果和同学自学的成绩。制造方法的习题，郑林庆先生起初是规定同学去看参考书，做报告，同学提出意见说，这样等于抄书，他马上改变方法，教同学研究实际机件的制造程序，例如要大批制造一定大小的齿轮时，必须经过那些加工过程，用些什么工具和工具机，用多大的进刀和切削速度，这样使同学容易融会贯通了解各章的关系。
