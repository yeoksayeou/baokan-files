Professors from Normal University and Tsinghua University
　Support the Issuance of Victory Bonds

    The decision on the issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds, passed by the Fourth Session of the Central People's Government Committee, is a completely necessary measure that addresses the current situation and takes into account the welfare of the entire people. Standing from the position of educators, we must resolutely support it and complete the purchase of bonds as a glorious task.
    Today, the glorious task placed before the people of the whole country is to eliminate the remnant reactionary forces and achieve complete victory nationwide, so as to rapidly embark on the road of restoring construction and developing production. The issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds is the method that must be adopted to achieve this goal.
    As Vice Premier Chen Yun said: "The people's purchase of bonds is also a burden under the current national economic difficulties, but this burden is much better than the losses suffered due to the increased issuance of banknotes and the depreciation of currency, because as a result of the depreciation of currency, the value of the depreciated part is completely lost. The bonds that are purchased may seem like a burden at the moment, but after all, the principal can be repaid with interest, which is not a loss." Standing in the position of educators, we must make universal and in-depth propaganda to the broad masses about the truth that the issuance of bonds is beneficial to the people. Comrade Chen Yun is right.
    Speaking of the income of educational workers today: it is better than that of other classes, and we should have a deeper understanding of the significance of issuing bonds. When purchasing bonds, we should take the lead and launch a warm movement to strive for purchases. We must regard the purchase of bonds as a major test in the process of our ideological transformation, as a concrete manifestation of loving the motherland and loving the people, just as Vice Premier Guo Moruo said: "Glory belongs to those who victoriously bear the burden."

    First, the national financial budget most easily reflects the nature of a country. Our financial budget this time also happens to show the substance of the people's regime. All national income must be taken directly or indirectly from the people, and all national expenditure is for the people: to liberate all the people of the country from the oppressed situation of being in dire straits; to cultivate the people's strength; to restore and develop production. As for frankly stating the financial difficulties, the crux of the difficulties, and the solutions to the difficulties without any ambiguity, it is not only because the people care about these things and should be told frankly, but also because being honest and doing things in a down-to-earth manner is fundamentally the character of the people's regime.
    Second, I believe that the announcement of this financial budget will increase the infinite trust of the general public, general public employees, and general industrialists and businessmen in our newly established regime. Financial economy is originally the most thorny issue. The difficulties that everyone guesses are perhaps even greater than the difficulties that the government has clearly stated; from the budget, we have clearly seen that our main difficulties are caused by continuous victorious wars and by restoring and expanding production. That kind of difficulty itself is full of hope. Chairman Mao's words about the financial budget, "There are difficulties, there is hope, and there are solutions," are decisive and give everyone great confidence.
    Third, I believe that the method of issuing victory bonds that accompany the announcement of this budget will proceed very smoothly. It is fair and reasonable for industrialists and businessmen to underwrite the bonds today. In the Liberation War, the peasants almost shouldered all the burdens of manpower and material resources. Industrialists and businessmen are able to live and work in peace and contentment under the new revolutionary order, and of course they must also fairly share some responsibilities. Moreover, the phased issuance of this small amount of bonds will stabilize prices, and the first to benefit will be industrialists and businessmen. They directly help the government, and indirectly they are helping themselves. And the government's good credit for them and the adoption of the indexed method for the bonds will definitely encourage them and make them have a competitive movement to purchase the bonds.

  　拥护发行胜利公债
  　　　　　师大历史系教授　马特
    中央人民政府委员会第四次会议通过的关于发行人民胜利折实公债的决定，完全是针对当前要局，照顾全民福利的必要措施。我们站在教育工作者的立场，必须坚决的拥护，并把购买公债当作光荣的任务来完成。
    今天摆在全国人民面前的光荣任务，是肃清反动残余势力，取得全国范围的完全胜利，以使迅速走上恢复建设和发展生产的道路。人民胜利折实公债的发行，就是为达到这个目的的而不得不采取的办法。
    诚如陈云副总理所说：“人民购买公债，在全国经济困难情况下，也是一种负担，但这种负担比起因增发钞票，币价下跌所受损失要好多了，因为币价下跌的结果，其下跌部分的币值，是全部损失了的。购买了的公债，在一时看来是担负，但究竟可以还本得息，不是一种损失。”我们站在教育工作者的岗位上，必须对于发行公债有利人民的真理向广大群众作普遍而深入的宣传，陈云同志的话是对的。
    就今天教育工作才的收入而说：比其他阶层都较好，我们对发行公债的意义应更了解深切。在购买公债时，我们应起带头作用，掀起一个热烈的运动来争取购买。要把购买公债当作自己思想改造过程中一大考验，当作热爱祖国热爱人民的一个具体表现，正如郭沫若副总理所说：“光荣属于胜利的负担者。”

    第一，国家财政概算最容易反映一个国家的性质。我们这次的财政概算，也恰好表现出了人民政权的物质。国家全部收入，要直接间接取之于人民，国家全部支出，也无在不是为了人民：为了使全国人民，都由水深火热的被压迫状况下解放出来；为了培养民力；为了恢复并发展生产。至若一点也不含糊的把财政上的困难，困难的症结，解决困难的办法，合盘表白出来，那就不仅是因为人民关心的事，要坦白的让人民知道，同时还因为老实的讲，踏实的做，根本就是人民政权的性格。
    第二，这次财政概算的公布，我相信，一般人民，一般公教人员，一般工商业者，都会对于我们这个刚刚成立不久的政权，增加无限的信任。财政经济原是最棘手的问题。大家猜想中的困难，也许比政府明白表白出的困难还大多得；从概算中，我们已清楚我们主要的困难，是由连续的胜利战争造出的，是由恢复并扩张生产造出的。那种困难本身，正充满了希望。毛主席有关财政概算所讲的“是有困难的，是有希望的，是有办法的”话，斩钉截铁，使每个人发生极大的信心。
    第三，们随这次概算公布的发行胜利公债办法，我相信是会进行得非常顺利的。公债由工商业者承销，在今日是公平而合理。在解放战争中，农民差不多承担起了一切人力物力的负担。工商业者得在新的革命秩序下安居乐业的从事经营，当然也得公平分担一点责任。况且这一项数目不大的公债，分期发行，把物价稳定下来，首先受惠的就是工商业者，他们直接帮助政府，间接就是帮助他们自己。而政府对于他们的良好信用，和公债采取折实的方式，定会鼓励他们，使他们对公债发生个竞购运动。
