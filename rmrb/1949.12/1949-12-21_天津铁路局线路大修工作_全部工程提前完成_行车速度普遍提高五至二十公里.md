　　Tianjin Railway Bureau's Line Overhaul Work
    All Projects Completed Ahead of Schedule
    Train Speed Generally Increased by Five to Twenty Kilometers
    [Our Dispatch] The Tianjin Railway Bureau, acting on orders to carry out major overhaul work, has successfully completed it half a month ahead of schedule after overcoming difficulties in manpower, materials, and tools. Awards are being prepared for excellent work areas such as Dingxing and Luofa. After receiving instructions from the Ministry of Railways on September 12, the Tianjin Railway Bureau immediately convened a meeting of section-level cadres to formulate construction methods, dispatched senior cadres to the front lines to strengthen organizational leadership, and established close ties with the trade union, public security section, and local government. Drawing on the experience of amateur road maintenance, they relied on the masses, mobilizing 800,000 farmers, local cadres, and soldiers, which solved the manpower shortage. Workers in various sections voluntarily made pickaxe handles, iron planes, and sieves, and farmers brought their own furniture, which solved the tool shortage. Adopting design drawings from Soviet experts and manufacturing anti-creep devices in large quantities solved the material shortage. Cadres, workers, and the masses in all sections and districts worked together, completing the entire project half a month ahead of schedule. In late November, the Engineering Department of the Railway Bureau dispatched six groups to conduct major inspections in areas such as Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Dezhou, Changxindian, and Fengtai. The Zhangjiakou Sub-bureau also sent people to conduct inspections, inspecting a total of 132 work areas. The results were good. According to standard testing, 14 work areas scored above 90 points, 68 work areas scored above 80 points, and the rest were above 60 points. Only the Guye No. 2 work area failed. The Dingxing and Luofa work areas were the best. The average score for all work areas on the line was 81.5.
    After this major overhaul, the entire line has been completely renewed, the quality of the line has been strengthened, and the gauge, straightness, joints, front and rear heights, and width and height of the roadbed have all been straightened and reinforced. This has increased train speed by five to twenty kilometers in general, and by thirty kilometers between Gaobeidian and Baoding. Drainage is smooth, and the service life of the sleepers has been extended. However, individual work areas still have many shortcomings, such as the poor focus on the loess slope work, the uneven ballast in several work areas in Dezhou, and poor tamping work. The curve at kilometer 331 of Gujiazhuang exceeds 50 mm, the outer rail is worn, ten consecutive rail joints in Wali all exceed 20 mm, there are loose and missing spikes in the Zhonghe work area, and forty screws are loose in Xuguantun. These do not meet the standards set by the Ministry.

　　天津铁路局线路大修工作
    全部工程提前完成
    行车速度普遍提高五至二十公里
    【本报讯】天津铁路局奉令进行大修工作，经过克服人工材料工具困难，已提前半月胜利完成。并对定兴、落垡等优良工区，准备给以奖励。九月十二日，天津铁路局接到铁道部指示后，即召集科段级干部会议，制定施工办法，派高级干部亲到各现场加强组织领导，并与工会、公安段、地方政府取得密切连系。接受上次业余养路经验依靠群众，动员了八十万农民及地方干部、军队，解决了人力困难。各段工友们自动做镐把、铁刨子、筛子，农民自带家具，解决了工具困难。采用苏联专家设计图样，大批制造防爬器，解决了材料困难。各段区干部职工及群众，一齐动手，全部工程提前半月完成。上月下旬，路局工务处又派出六个小组分赴京、津、唐、德、长辛店、丰台等地区进行大检查。张家口分局亦派人进行了检查，共检查了一百三十二个工区，结果成绩良好。根据标准测验得九十分以上者十四个工区，八十分以上者六十八个工区，其余均在六十分以上，不及格者只古冶第二工区一个工区，定兴、落垡两工区最好，全线各工区平均分为八十一．五。
    经过此次大修，全路已焕然一新，加强了线路质量，轨距、曲直、接缝、前后高低、路基宽高度等都绳正与加固了。使行车速度，普遍提高五公里到二十公里，高碑店到保定间提高了三十公里，排水通畅，枕木延长寿命。但个别工区仍有不少缺点，如黄土坡工作抓得不紧，德县的几个工区石碴不整齐，捣固工作差；古家庄三三一公里的曲线超过五○公厘，外轨磨损，洼里十个连续轨缝都超过二十公厘，中河工区有道钉浮起不正及缺道钉现象，许官屯有四十个螺丝松动，这都是不合乎部定标准的。
