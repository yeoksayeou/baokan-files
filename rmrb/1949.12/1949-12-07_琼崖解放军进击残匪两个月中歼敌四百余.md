Xinhua News Agency, Qiongya, 6th. Buoyed by the founding of the People's Republic of China and the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army into South and Southwest China, the Qiongya People's Liberation Army, following its anti-looting campaign in September, bravely attacked remnant bandit strongholds and along highways in October and November, annihilating 442 enemies. In October, the Liberation Army launched widespread offensives in Qiongdong, Qiongnan, Qiongxi, and Qiongbei, eliminating four enemy strongholds in the southern part of Wenchang County and annihilating over 170 enemies. After a small number of remnant bandits who escaped the annihilation campaign in the Yangjiang area of Southwest Guangdong fled to Qiongya, the Qiongya bandit army frantically carried out armed grain robbery. On October 18th, the remnant bandit 64th Army, 159th Division, concentrated two regiments to harass the Qinghe Township area on the border between Lingao and Chengmai in the Qiongbei Liberation Area. On the 19th, the People's Liberation Army annihilated a part of these bandits, and the remaining bandits fled towards Nada. On October 31st, the bandit 64th Army, 131st Division, again launched a full-scale looting campaign in the Powei area of Chengmai. The People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local militia, fought back valiantly, completely defeating the bandits, killing and wounding over 20 of them. In November, the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the bandit army to protect the people's autumn harvest. On the 11th, in the Changjiang and Beili areas, a battalion of the 156th Division, 466th Regiment, was annihilated, and the bandit battalion commander was captured. The battalion's deputy commander immediately led a company to surrender to the Liberation Army. The remnant bandits guarding Ganen County, intimidated by the power of the Liberation Army, fled in panic to Beili the next day. On November 17th, the Liberation Army intercepted a transport team of the bandit army's Independent Artillery 8th Battalion on the coastal highway of Yaxian County, seizing over 10,000 rounds of various bullets and shells. On the 18th, when the Liberation Army attacked the Lin Yu stronghold between Yulin and Sanjiang, 62 bandits of the 4th Army, 268th Division, were killed, wounded, or captured. The Liberation Army in the Qiongdong area also intercepted and annihilated a platoon of the bandit 32nd Army, 252nd Division, which had penetrated into the Shibi Market on the border between Ding'an and Lehui, on the 21st. In total, 442 enemy soldiers were annihilated in October and November, and 18 light and heavy machine guns, 14 submachine guns, 235 rifles, 12 rifle grenades, and one 60mm mortar were seized.
