Kawashima confessed to his vile crimes:
　　Unit 731 established a special prison where inmates were used as germ warfare test subjects, killing 3,000 Chinese and Soviet people in five years.
    In response to the prosecutor's questions, Kawashima stated that Unit 731's organization consisted of eight departments. The First Department was the main research unit for preparing bacteriological weapons and engaged in human experimentation. In the center of Unit 731's building complex was a special prison, invisible from the outside, used to confine Chinese patriots and Soviet citizens, on whom they forcibly conducted lethal germ experiments. Among them were women, some with infants. Within the unit's area, in addition to the prison, was a crematorium where the bodies of those who had been tortured to death were incinerated. If a person infected with bacteria did not die, they would be subjected to repeated experiments until they were thrown into the crematorium.
    Prosecutor: "Does this mean that anyone who was imprisoned in Unit 731's prison was destined to die there?"
    Kawashima: "Yes, that is correct."
    Over five years, approximately 3,000 people painfully died in the unit's prison due to forced infection with deadly bacteria.
    The Second Department of Unit 731 conducted field experiments with deadly bacteria. The Second Department experimented with various bacteriological weapons—bombs containing infectious bacteria and plague flea dispersal devices, etc. The Second Department had a dedicated department for breeding fleas. The department had its own firing range and its own aircraft near Anda Station (in Heilongjiang Province).
    Kawashima, with a shameless nonchalance, described how bombs containing plague fleas were tested on living people at the firing range. For example, in the summer of 1941, fifteen people from the unit's prison were taken by plane to this firing range. They were tied to iron pillars, and then ceramic bombs containing plague fleas were dropped from the plane onto the firing range. The defendant confessed, "Colonel Ohtani, who carried out this operation, regretted that not all of the people in this experiment died."
    The ceramic shells of the germ bombs were manufactured by the Third Department of Unit 731.
    Kawashima confessed that the main duty of the Fourth Department of the unit was to mass-breed and culture bacteria for bacteriological warfare.
    Furthermore, under the jurisdiction of Unit 731 were four detachments located near the Soviet-Manchurian border—in Linkou, Hailin Station (in Songjiang Province), Suifenhe, and Hailar (in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region).
    Prosecutor: "Therefore, do you confirm your testimony that these detachments would be the mainstays for the use of bacteriological weapons once war against the Soviet Union broke out, and that these detachments were dispatched to areas directly adjacent to the Soviet Union for this purpose?"
    Kawashima: "Yes, that is correct."
    The defendant confessed that Unit 731's activities became particularly intense after Fascist Germany launched its war against the Soviet Union.
    In the summer of 1941, Unit 731's commander, Lieutenant General Shiro Ishii, convened a special meeting of the heads of each department and informed them that he had received various instructions from the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff regarding intensifying preparations for bacteriological warfare. Ishii specifically ordered the completion of the task of cultivating 200 kilograms of fleas within a specific period.
    The work of the Fourth Department, headed by Kawashima, was also expanded. The department's production thus increased to producing 300 kilograms of plague bacteria per month, or 800 to 900 kilograms of typhoid bacteria, or 500 to 700 kilograms of anthrax bacteria, or one ton of cholera bacteria.

### 川岛供认无耻罪行：　七三一部队设特别监狱，关进的人都被用作病菌试验品，五年中杀害中苏人民三千。

　　川岛供认无耻罪行：
　  七三一部队设特别监狱，关进的人都被用作病菌试验品，五年中杀害中苏人民三千。
    川岛回答检察官的质问时称；七三一部队的机构有八个处。第一处是准备细菌武器中的主要研究部门，并从事活人实验。在七三一部队大厦广场的中央有一座在外面看不见的特别监狱，用来禁闭中国爱国者和苏联人，在他们身上强迫施行致命的细菌的实验，其中有妇女，有的还带着婴儿。在该队的地区内，除监狱外还有火葬场，被虐杀的人们的尸体，就在那里焚毁。如果染上细菌的人未死，他就会反复受实验，一直到他被投到火葬炉里。
    检察官：“这是否就是说，凡是关进七三一部队监狱里的人，都非死在那里不可呢？”
    川岛：“是的，是这样。”
    在五年中，在该部队的监狱里因强使传染致死的细菌而痛楚死去的人，约有三千名。
    七三一部队的第二处作致死的细菌的野外实验。第二处曾实验各种细菌武器——装有传染细菌的炸弹和鼠疫跳蚤散播器等。第二处有一个专门繁殖跳蚤的部门。该处在安达（按在黑龙江省）站附近有它自己的靶场和它自己的飞机。
    川岛以无耻的满不在乎的态度，描述装有鼠疫跳蚤的炸弹，如何在打靶场活人身上实验的情形。例如在一九四一年夏天，把该部队监狱里的十五个人，由飞机带到这个靶场上。他们被绑在铁柱上，然后从飞机上将装有鼠疫跳蚤的陶瓷炸弹投在靶场上。被告供称：“执行这件事情的大谷大佐对于这次实验中的人们没有完全死光，引为遗憾。”
    细菌弹的陶瓷弹壳是七三一部队第三处制造的。
    川岛供称：该队第四处的主要职务是为细菌战而大规模繁殖和培养细菌。
    此外，在七三一部队的管辖下还有四个支队，设在苏满边境的附近——在林口、海林（按在松江省）站，苏尼夫及海拉尔（按在内蒙自治区）。
    检察官：“因此，你是否证实你的供词，说这些支队在对苏战争一旦爆发时，将是使用细菌武器的几个支柱，并且这些支队就是为了这个目的而被派到直接毗连苏联的地区呢？”
    川岛：“对的，是这样。”
    被告供认在法西斯德国对苏联开战之后，七三一部队的活动特别紧张。
    一九四一年夏季，七三一部队队长石井四朗中将召集该部各处处长举行特别会议，并通知他们说，他已收到日军参谋总长关于加紧准备细菌战争的各种训令。石井特别指定要完成在一定期间之内培植二百公斤的跳蚤这一任务。
    以川岛为首的第四处的工作也扩大了。该处的产量因此增至每月生产三百公斤鼠疫菌，或八百至九百公斤伤寒菌，或五百至七百公斤炭疽热病菌，或一吨霍乱菌。
