Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th (via TASS, New York, December 29th): The *Worker* newspaper reports that the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States recently held an enlarged meeting. The meeting discussed four main issues: (1) the internal situation of the labor movement, including the divisive policies of the CIO leadership and the new tasks for struggling for unified labor action; (2) the people's future steps for struggling for peace, including the most vigorous struggle against Titoism and the attempts of Titoites to undermine the American peace movement; (3) the prospects for the 1950 elections and the need to resolutely implement the united front policy and establish a broad people's democratic alliance policy; (4) the results of the Foley Square trial and the nationwide propaganda campaign surrounding the Communist leaders' appeal to higher courts, as well as strengthening the Communist Party and raising its vigilance.

The *Worker* newspaper said that the National Committee adopted an action program on each of the above issues.

The National Committee co-opted Hall (one of the eleven Communist leaders on trial at Foley Square) as a secretary of the National Committee. Therefore, in addition to USCP Chairman Foster and General Secretary Dennis, the USCP secretaries now also include Winston, Williamson, and Hall. The National Committee also elected F. Vanni, former Labor Secretary of the Illinois State Committee of the Communist Party, as Secretary of the Department of Public Affairs, and A. Johnson as Secretary of the Defense Committee.

The National Committee also decided to reorganize and strengthen all organizations of the Communist Party.
