Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 26th -- TASS Beirut, December 25th: According to "Al-Hadaf" newspaper, citing authoritative sources, serious divisions have arisen within the Indian government since Nehru's return from the United States. Nehru's negotiations in Washington have provoked strong opposition within the Indian government. The opposition is led by Nehru's Deputy Prime Minister, Patel, and is supported by the British High Commissioner to India, Nye. Patel and his group are doing their utmost to obstruct the implementation of the agreements signed by Nehru in Washington, especially the clauses regarding facilitating the penetration of American capital into India. As a result of this opposition, the Indian government has rejected Nehru's proposal to grant the United States the right to establish factories in India in exchange for American grain. Authoritative sources are convinced that the Counselor of the US Embassy in India has lodged a strong protest with the British High Commissioner in India, protesting Britain's anti-American policy in India.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 26th -- TASS, December 25th: The British "Daily Worker" published materials proving the increasing financial control of India by the United States. Throughout 1949, financial negotiations between Indian and American representatives continued intermittently, and the meetings between American and Indian industrialists in Delhi strengthened these negotiations. The "Daily Worker" pointed out that India has obtained two loans from the International Bank under US control. However, these two loans are short-term, and the interest rate is as high as four percent. The purpose of the industrialists' meeting in Delhi was to discuss the conditions under which it would be suitable for American companies to invest in or acquire Indian companies. The demands of American capitalists are: first, American companies can freely obtain profits from India; second, American companies are guaranteed immunity from any "nationalization"; and third, maintain "domestic stability." That is to say, to make Indian trade unions subject to the control of the Indian government.

　　印度政府内部分歧
    尼赫鲁在美时签订了便利美资入侵的协定，亲英派表示反对。  同时美使馆“抗议”英国“反美政策”。
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社贝鲁特二十五日讯：据“阿尔·哈达夫”报引权威方面消息称，自尼赫鲁从美国返印以来，印度政府内部发生了严重的分歧。尼赫鲁在华盛顿的谈判，引起了印度政府内部的强烈反对。反对派是以尼赫鲁的副总理巴特尔为首，并获得英国驻印度高级专员奈伊的支持。巴特尔及其集团竭力阻挠尼赫鲁在华盛顿所签订的协定的执行，特别是关于便利美国资本渗入印度的条款。反对派这一反对的结果，使印度政府拒绝了尼赫鲁所提关于给美国在印度设立工厂的权利以换取美国谷物的议案。权威人士确信：美国驻印大使馆参事已向英国驻印高级专员提出强硬抗议，抗议英国在印度实行反美政策。
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社二十五日讯：英工人日报登载了证明美国对印度的财政控制增强的材料。在一九四九年全年内，印度与美国两国代表之间的财政谈判时断时续，美国和印度两国工业家在德里举行的会议加强了这些谈判。工人日报指出，印度已从美国控制之下的国际银行获得两笔贷款。但这两笔贷款是短期的，而且利率竟高达百分之四。工业家们在德里会议的目的，是商议在什么条件上才适合于美国对印度公司投资或收买印度公司。美国资本家的要求是：一，美国公司能从印度自由取得利润；二，美国公司获得免于任何“国有化”的保证；三，维持“国内稳定”。这就是说，要使印度工会受到印度政府的控制。
