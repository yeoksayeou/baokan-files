　　Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 18th—The remnant forces of the Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandit armies, who roamed the Guangdong-Guangxi border region, have been basically eliminated, except for a portion who fled to Vietnam. The People's Liberation Army of the South China Front, in carrying out the mopping-up mission from the 9th to the 14th of this month, annihilated and captured more than 16,000 enemy troops and liberated Zhennanguan, a vital national defense location on the southern border of Guangxi, as well as the coastal towns of Fangcheng and Dongxing. After the People's Liberation Army annihilated three bandit corps on the Guangdong-Guangxi border, the remaining bandits fled to the Dayongshan area of Beiliu, Yulin, and Luchuan, attempting to cross the Shiwan Mountains and escape to Vietnam or flee south along the Nanning-Zhennanguan highway. In order to completely eliminate the remaining bandits within the national borders, the People's Liberation Army, regardless of fatigue, immediately pursued and mopped them up. On the 9th and 10th, the People's Liberation Army captured alive in this area the bandit commander of the 48th Army, Zhang Wenhong, the deputy commander of the 126th Army, Wang Weicang, and the deputy commander of the 229th Division, Pan Qiao, along with more than 3,000 officers and soldiers. The puppet Beiliu, Rongxian, and Yulin county chiefs led their troops of over 500 in surrendering.
　　After liberating Yongchun, another route of the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated on the 11th the bandit Xiang-Gui-Qian Highway Protection Army Headquarters, the puppet Nanning Prefecture Commissioner's Office, the bandit Independent 4th Regiment Headquarters, two companies of the Guilin Pacification Headquarters Training Team, and the Guixi Garrison New Recruit Regiment, which had fled to the Xin'anwei area southwest of Yongchun, capturing alive the bandit Xiang-Gui-Qian Highway Protection Army Lieutenant General Commander Mo Dehong, Major General Chief of Staff Zhou Tianhuan, Nanning Prefecture Major General Commissioner Mo Jiao, and 48th Army Deputy Chief of Staff Tao Yunjang, along with over 1,000 officers and soldiers. On the 12th, 602 bandits from the Ministry of National Defense Assault First and Second Columns and a portion of the remnant bandits of the 80th Division surrendered under the leadership of Battalion Commander Huang Chuny. On the 13th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army carried out a 140-li long-distance raid, pursuing and annihilating a mixed force of 1,000 bandits composed of the remnant troops of the 174th Division, the 172nd Division, the 304th Division, and the 3rd Corps directly subordinate teams south of Feiyinwei, in Shuangfeng Village.
　　The People's Liberation Army liberating Qinzhou, after completely annihilating the directly subordinate units of the bandit Central China Military and Political Chief Executive's Office, pursued along the coastal highway towards the Guangdong-Guangxi border line, liberating the coastal strategic point of Fangcheng on the 8th, and annihilating more than 1,500 remnant bandits of the 303rd Division of the 126th Army en route. On the 9th, they marched into Dongxing, a major coastal defense town.
　　Another route of the People's Liberation Army marched south from Nanning in a fierce pursuit of the remaining bandits attempting to flee to Vietnam, capturing Shangsi on the 8th, and completely annihilating the puppet Shangsi County Security Regiment. En route, they pursued and annihilated most of the directly subordinate team of the bandit 71st Army, the 88th Division Headquarters, and the 262nd Regiment, capturing the bandit 71st Army Commander Xiong Xinmin and over 3,100 officers and soldiers. This unit continued to liberate Sile on the 9th and pursued and annihilated the entire 187th Regiment of the 63rd Division of the 14th Army, 30 li northeast of Sile city in Nalong, capturing the bandit Colonel Regiment Commander Tao Fushun and over 550 people. At the same time, the bandit 303rd Division Commander Qin Guoxiang, Deputy Division Commander Shi Wangyuan, Chief of Staff Yang Foren, and the bandit 188th Division Chief of Staff Liu Juyun, along with 1,209 officers and soldiers, surrendered. The People's Liberation Army liberated Mingjiang and Ningming on the 10th, liberated Pingxiang on the 11th, and marched into Zhennanguan, a border town bordering Vietnam. On the 13th, about 10,000 remnant bandits of the 1st Corps fled into Vietnam from Aidian, east of Zhennanguan. The remaining bandits also attempted to flee abroad from that location, but on the 14th, they were pursued and completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army at Gongtianshan, north of Aidian, capturing over 4,000 bandits, including the 97th Army Deputy Commander Guo Wenhuan. By this point, the remaining Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandit troops who had fled to the Guangdong-Guangxi border region were basically eliminated.
