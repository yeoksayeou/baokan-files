　　"Gaining Both Fame and Fortune"
　　Xiang Yang
　　The Central People's Government, in order to make up for the fiscal deficit next year, to stabilize the people's livelihood, to restore and develop economic construction..., in short, for the greatest benefit of all the people, has resolved and adopted the issuance of Victory Index-Linked Bonds. That is to say, it is borrowing money from the people in the form of bonds. So buying bonds is the same as lending money to the government. And the government borrows money to do things for everyone, to solve difficulties for everyone, and to develop production. At the same time, the bonds are calculated on an index-linked basis, with interest, and are also guaranteed, so buying bonds is the same as index-linked savings. Only a people's government can be so thoughtful and fair in issuing bonds.
　　But who should this money be borrowed from? That is to say, who has the strength to lend money to the government? Of course, everyone should fulfill this obligation, but I think the main reliance should be on wealthy friends in the industrial and commercial sectors in the cities, as well as landlords and rich peasants in the newly liberated areas. Because everyone knows that in the Liberation War, the peasants bore the entire burden of manpower and materials, and in fact, they should no longer be relied upon.
　　Don't we often say, "Everyone does their part," "Those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength"? Then, today, when the government is issuing bonds to solve difficulties for everyone, those with money should fulfill the responsibility of "contributing money" to show that "one should not decline to do what is right." Especially those who hold idle funds, I think this is an excellent opportunity!
　　During the reactionary rule, there were some people whose money could not find, nor could possibly find, a proper outlet, so they engaged in speculation and hoarding, which was an inevitable phenomenon under the oppression of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. But we cannot deny that this is an improper behavior. However, today, imperialism has been driven away, bureaucratic capitalists have been overthrown, the country belongs to our people, and we ourselves are the masters. Therefore, those who engage in speculation and hoarding should quickly change their ways and use their funds in the right way. Buying bonds is the best way out.
　　Speculation and hoarding are illegal today and cannot be forgiven by the people. On the contrary, buying bonds is "gaining both fame and fortune."
　　In short, if the funds used for speculation and hoarding are used to buy bonds, not only can the government use it to develop production, but our funds will also be guaranteed, and we can also get interest with certainty. At the same time, we are also fulfilling our due responsibility to the country. Why not do it?!

　　“名利双收”
    向阳
    中央人民政府为了补足明年财政上的赤字，为了安定人民的生活，恢复和发展经济建设……，简单说为了全体人民的最大利益，决议并通过了发行胜利折实公债。也就是说要通过公债的形式向人民借一笔钱。所以说购买公债就等于借钱给政府。而政府借到了钱是为了给大家办事，给大家解决困难，是为了发展生产。同时公债是用折实计算，给利息，也有保障，购买了公债就等于折实储蓄。发行公债能想的这么周到，办得这么公平，是只有人民的政府才能这样做的。
    然而这钱要向谁借呢？也就是说谁有力量把钱借给政府呢？当然是大家都该尽这个义务的，不过我想主要的还是要依靠城市中工商界有钱的朋友们，以及新解放区的地主富农们。因为谁都晓得在解放战争中，农民们担负了整个的人力和物力，事实上不应该再依赖他们了。
    我们不是常说：“大家的事大家干”，“有钱出钱，有力出力”吗？那末在政府发行公债，要替大家解决困难的今天，有钱的人是应该尽“有钱出钱”的责任，来表示“当仁不让”的时候了。其中特别是手中握有游资的人们，我以为更是一个绝好的机会！
    在反动派统治的时候，有一部分人，他们的钱由于找不到也不可能找到正当的出路，所以就干起了囤积居奇的事，这是在帝国主义官僚资本主义压迫下必然形成的一种现象。但我们却不能否认这是一种不正当的行为。然而今天呢，帝国主义已被赶走，官僚资本家已被推翻，国家是我们人民自己的，主人是由我们自己来做了。所以做投机倒把，囤积居奇的人们，应该赶快改行，把拥有的资金用在正路上去。购买公债就是最好的出路。
    囤积倒把在今天是违法的，是不能被人民原谅的，相反，购买了公债，却是“名利双收”。
    总之，若把做囤积居奇的资金购买了公债，不但政府可以利用它发展生产，而且我们的资金也有了保证，又可十拿十准的得到利息，同时，自己也是对国家尽了应尽的责任，这又何乐而不为呢？！
