Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 14th: According to TASS: Soviet women enjoy undying glory both in the peaceful period of socialist construction and in the harsh years of the Patriotic War. Now, they stand at the forefront of the fighters for building communism, enthusiastically support the Soviet state’s peaceful foreign policy, and strengthen the socialist motherland with their selfless labor.

　　Soviet Supreme Soviet Deputy Chimnaz Aslanova, in a description published in Pravda about the development of women in the Azerbaijan Republic under the socialist system, stated that women now account for nearly 50 percent of the students in higher education institutions in the Azerbaijan Republic. Eleven thousand young working women attend night schools. Tens of thousands of women serve in the republic's important industry – the oil industry. Among the women in the republic, there are People's Artists, professors, and Stalin Prize winners.

　　Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Karelo-Finnish Republic, Marulgina, in a report in Izvestia, described how women's talents and creativity are developed in the Soviet era. In the United States, Britain, and other capitalist countries, there are unequal and humiliating laws that degrade women's dignity. But in the Soviet Union, women are guaranteed truly equal rights for the first time in history. Millions of women have been absorbed into activities and construction work for the happiness of the motherland. In the Karelo-Finnish Republic, as in other union republics, women represent a tremendous force. They can be seen in factories, forests, and fishing grounds, in railway and river transportation, and in education and public health agencies. And, everywhere, women have achieved remarkable success in their work.

　　Communications from several cities published in Pravda also describe the glorious achievements of Soviet women. In Stalingrad, they actively participated in the city's reconstruction. More than 40,000 women volunteers participated in rebuilding Stalingrad. A communication from Riga, the capital of Latvia, said: In Latvia, under bourgeois rule, women were deprived of the right to participate in state administration. The vast majority of women were confined to their homes, serving like slaves or serfs. Now, women in Soviet Latvia hold important positions in various aspects of the economy and culture. Thousands of women have become representatives of the Soviet and cadres of party organizations.

　　苏联妇女以忘我的劳动
    加强社会主义祖国力量
    【新华社北京十四日电】据塔斯社讯：苏联妇女，无论是在和平的社会主义建设时期，或在爱国战争的严酷考验的年代中，都享有永不磨灭的光荣。现在，她们站在建设共产主义的斗士的前列，热烈地拥护苏维埃国家的和平外交政策，并以她们的忘我的劳动来加强社会主义祖国的力量。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表契姆纳兹·阿斯拉诺娃，在真理报上描述阿塞拜疆共和国妇女在社会主义制度下发展称：现在，妇女几占阿塞拜疆共和国高等教育机关在学人数的百分之五十。一万一千名青年劳动妇女参加了夜校。数万名妇女服务于共和国的重要工业——石油工业。在共和国的妇女中，有人民艺术家、教授和斯大林奖金获奖者。
    卡累利阿——芬兰共和国部长会议副主席马尔乌吉娜，在消息报中描述妇女的才能和创造力在苏维埃时代是如何地发展着。在美国、英国和其他的资本主义国家，有着对妇女的不平等的、侮辱她们尊严的卑劣和残忍的法律。但在苏联，妇女是有史以来第一次被保证享有真正平等的权利。数百万妇女被吸收到为祖国的幸福的活动和建设工作中。在卡累利阿——芬兰共和国，也象在别的加盟共和国一样，妇女代表着巨大的力量。在工厂、森林和渔场，在铁路和江河运输，在教育和公共卫生机关，都可以看到她们。并且，在各个地方，妇女在工作中都获得了显著的成就。
    真理报刊载的来自若干城市的通讯，也描述着苏联妇女的光辉的业迹。在斯大林格勒，她们积极地参加了该城的复兴工作。有四万多妇女志愿工作者参加重建斯大林格勒。来自拉脱维亚首都里加的通讯说：从前，在资产阶级统治下的拉脱维亚，妇女们是被剥夺参加国家行政的权利的。绝大多数妇女都被关在家庭里，象奴隶或农奴一样地服役。现在，苏维埃拉脱维亚的妇女，担任着经济和文化各方面的重要的职位。数千名妇女已成为苏维埃的代表和党组织的干部。
