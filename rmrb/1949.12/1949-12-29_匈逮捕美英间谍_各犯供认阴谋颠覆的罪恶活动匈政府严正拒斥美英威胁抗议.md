　　Hungary Arrests American and British Spies
　　Criminals Confess to Sinister Activities of Conspiracy and Subversion. Hungarian Government Sternly Rejects American and British Threats and Protests
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 28th: The Hungarian State Security Agency arrested American national Vogeler, British national Sanders, Hungarian national Gyger, and others in November for conducting subversive and sabotage activities in Hungary. American and British imperialism have continuously lodged protests and made threats, attempting to exonerate these spies, but have been sternly rejected by the Hungarian government.
According to TASS, the Hungarian Ministry of Interior's Press Office issued a statement on the 25th regarding this case, stating: American professional spy Vogeler, under the orders of a spy agency, served as the leader of the Hungarian branch of the American International Standard Electric Company after World War II, to cover up his espionage activities. British intelligence agent Sanders and Gyger, the most important henchman of the American and British spies, also operated under the cover of the company. They recruited spies in Hungary, established a vast spy organization, collected economic and military intelligence, compiled technical plans, maps, and other materials of military secrets, and supplied them to their overseas spy centers. They engaged in subversive activities such as hindering production, financial speculation, and trading in prohibited goods, and organized criminal activities to enable spies to illegally cross borders and escape from Hungary. Due to all these sinister activities, the State Security Agency arrested Vogeler, Sanders, Gyger, and eleven other accomplices. Faced with a large number of documents and evidence obtained by the Hungarian authorities during the cracking of the crime den, the criminals have confessed to their sinister activities one by one.
At the same time, the Press Office of the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement on this case, stating: The American Embassy in Budapest submitted a note from the American government to the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 20, groundlessly demanding the release of Vogeler, demanding compensation for his arrest, and clamoring for threats of corresponding measures. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a note to the American Ambassador to Hungary on the 24th, stating: The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic most firmly declares that those who engage in activities against the existing democratic system of Hungary and against the Hungarian people cannot be allowed to enjoy freedom of movement and impunity in Hungarian territory, regardless of which country these spies, saboteurs, and slackers are citizens of. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic most firmly rejects these threats, because it believes that the aforementioned note from the American government is another crude attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic.
The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued the following statement: On December 19, the British Foreign Office notified the Hungarian Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in London that Britain demanded that the Hungarian government allow British consular officials to have the possibility of talking alone with the British citizen Sanders, who was arrested by the Hungarian authorities for committing espionage, sabotage, and other serious crimes. Britain will suspend trade and financial negotiations with Hungary until this is satisfied. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out: This notification from Britain is merely an attempt to exert pressure on the Hungarian government so that British citizens engaged in espionage activities can be acquitted. Regarding Anglo-Hungarian economic relations, the Hungarian government most firmly rejects the British government's attempt to threaten Hungary by this means.

　　匈逮捕美英间谍
　  各犯供认阴谋颠覆的罪恶活动匈政府严正拒斥美英威胁抗议
    【新华社北京二十八日电】匈牙利国家保安机关于十一月间逮捕了在匈进行颠覆破坏活动的美英间谍福格勒（美籍）、杉德斯（英籍）、吉格尔（匈籍）等。美英帝国主义曾不断提出抗议与威胁，企图使该间谍等免罪，已遭匈政府严正拒斥。
    据塔斯社讯，匈内政部新闻处于二十五日对本案发表声明称：美国职业间谍福格勒奉间谍机关的命令，在第二次大战后担任美国国际标准电讯公司匈牙利分公司的领导工作，掩护其间谍活动。英国特务机关人员杉德斯及美英间谍最主要的走狗吉格尔，亦在该公司的掩护下进行活动。他们在匈牙利招雇间谍，建立庞大的间谍组织，收集经济与军事情报，构成军事秘密的技术计划，地图及其他材料，供给他们在海外的间谍中心机构，进行阻碍生产、金融投机、买卖违禁品等颠覆活动，并组织使间谍分子非法越过边界，逃出匈牙利的犯罪活动。由于这一切罪恶活动，国家保安机关逮捕了福格勒、杉德斯、吉格尔及其他十一名同谋者。面对着匈牙利当局在破获罪窟时所获得的大批文件证据，各犯对他们的罪恶活动，已一一直认不讳。
    同时，匈外交部新闻处也为本案发表声明称：美国驻布达佩斯公使馆于十二月二十日将美国政府的照会一件，递交匈外交部，毫无根据地要求释放福格勒，要求为其被捕赔偿损失，并叫嚣以相应措施相威胁。匈外交部已于二十四日向美驻匈大使提出照会称：匈牙利人民共和国政府最坚决地宣布，对于那些进行反对匈牙利现存民主制度和反对匈牙利人民的活动的人们，无论如何不能允许他们在匈牙利领土上享有自由活动和不受惩罚的权利，不管这些间谍，破坏者与怠工者是那一个国家的公民。匈牙利人民共和国政府最坚决地拒斥这些威胁，因为它认为美国政府的上述照会，是干涉匈牙利人民共和国内政的另一粗暴的企图。
    匈外交部并发表下列声明：十二月十九日，英国外交部曾通知匈牙利驻伦敦特命全权公使称，英国要求匈牙利政府准许英国领事馆人员有可能单独与被匈牙利当局逮捕的犯有间谍、怠工破坏及其他严重罪行的英国臣民杉德斯谈话，英国在得到满足前，停止与匈牙利的贸易和财政谈判。匈外交部指出：英国这一通知只是一种想对匈牙利政府施行压力，使从事间谍活动的英国臣民得以免罪。关于英匈经济关系，匈牙利政府最坚决地拒斥英国政府想以这种手段来威胁匈牙利的企图。
