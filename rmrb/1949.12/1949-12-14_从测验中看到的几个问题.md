　　Several Problems Seen from the Quiz
    Propaganda Department of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    This political consultation conference document learning quiz was prepared and developed a week in advance. The quiz was conducted relatively seriously and formally. After the quiz, individual and collective reports were conducted. Therefore, it generally greatly promoted the learning of cadres throughout the city, and also exposed many problems belonging to the leadership in learning. Therefore, this quiz and learning inspection must be summarized in order to advance learning further.
  　First
    A total of 1,930 cadres and staff (excluding the Iron and Steel Company system) participated in the study of the CPPCC documents this time. This accounts for approximately 86 percent of the actual number of people. We have received 985 test papers and participant lists (some have not yet been sent). The number of people who did not participate was 463. The overall average score of the quiz was 61 points. The highest average score of the unit was 81 points, and the lowest average score of the unit was 32 points. From the quiz, the study of the CPPCC documents is still not in-depth, and the results are not very good, because the quiz stimulated it a bit, otherwise, I am afraid there would not be such results. This shows that our cadre learning is still poor, methods need to be studied, and the system is not formal. Learning in various agencies is also unbalanced (some have no learning at all). Therefore, we need to rectify and improve our learning.
  　Second
    The quiz can help people know their own progress and indeed promote learning, but some individual agencies are indifferent to it, learning for the sake of the quiz. However, some agencies have turned from deviation to the right track, and felt the need for learning from the promotion of the quiz. Some are purely for the quiz, and the end of the quiz is considered to have completed the task. The following are some ideological manifestations before and after the quiz:
    (1) Feeling that the quiz can promote and help learning is a good manifestation.
    1.  Before the quiz, because we had to prepare, everyone was generally nervous and invigorated. Everyone bought books. Those who were not notified to buy them also bought them automatically (the sales of Xinhua and Northwest bookstores alone were two to three thousand copies). Employees of the Electric Power Bureau, after the test questions were announced, some went home to study until late at night. Many people memorized and wrote, and there was a learning atmosphere everywhere.
    2.  After the quiz, it was another stimulus for everyone. Cadres in the Party Training Class believed: "It is good to have such quizzes, otherwise we would not know whether we have learned anything and how much we have understood after studying every day." Some who did not participate regretted it very much and asked for frequent quizzes in the future. Those who failed worked especially hard. In the past, newspapers were only read in general, but this time, everyone scrambled to read newspapers, determined to strive for "meeting next time." Some who did not participate in the quiz because of work asked participating comrades for questions to test themselves. A female comrade in the Industrial Zone scored more than 50 points on the first test and more than 60 points this time. She said: "I must get another 10 points next time." Another comrade challenged her and said: "I guarantee 80 points next time." There are also many comrades with low cultural levels who achieved very good results in this quiz, such as Deng Yubao in Qiling District, Zhao He in Qianshan District, Zhou Dianqing in the Industrial Zone, and Wang Demin in Tiedong District, all of whom scored above 82 points. Their good results are entirely due to their own efforts, and such comrades should be commended.
    3.  After the quiz, there was a general demand for learning. Many agencies established systems and combined them with work, which also improved work enthusiasm. For example, the Industry and Commerce Bureau now stipulates that after running every morning, they will study, so as to avoid getting up late and being late for study. Their accountant tried to change the way of working so that there was enough time to spare for studying. These agencies such as the Enterprise Management Office and the Construction Company have all changed. They have all been discussed at meetings. The Municipal Party Committee itself is also like this, only individual agencies such as the Trade Union are still relatively poor. Some agencies pay attention to business, but their political study is poor, which is also not right. It is okay for business to be a larger proportion, but it is still necessary to focus on studying politics and theory. 　 (2) Learning for the sake of the quiz is the second manifestation.
    1.  Copying down the 15 questions published in the newspaper, reciting and writing them out from memory, and some reciting the articles word for word. As a result, during the quiz, it was found that some questions were not within the 15 questions, so they complained that the higher authorities had not notified them (in fact, they had all been published in the newspaper). Some regretted that they should not have memorized dogma, felt that they had suffered a loss and should not have memorized it. Others have realized that memorizing dogma is not a good way to learn, and next time they must connect with their thinking and truly understand the spirit of the documents.
    2.  Some knew that the quiz was coming soon. Because the Worker's Life newspaper said that questions would be drawn for the quiz, they "gambled" on the questions. Some said that the first question must be there, and some said that the third question must be there. They were betting on treasures, and whoever guessed it would be suitable. As a result, some were right and some were wrong. After such a person finished the quiz, it was over.
    3.  Some were very active before the quiz, getting up early and working late, preparing to cope with the battle. But after the quiz, they felt relaxed. They didn't get up in the morning, and they weren't active in learning. It was like passing a "checkpoint." Some asked, "Will there be a quiz in the future?" He may think that it is best not to have a quiz again.
    4.  Some agencies were afraid of losing face, so they sent those who were better at studying to participate in the quiz, so that the overall average would look better. Some deserted at the last minute, knowing that there was a quiz and taking a side trip, or asking for sick leave. This also happened in Group A.
    5.  After the papers were graded, they argued over the scores. "Why do I have one point less than him? Why does he have more than me?" Even if someone said something to him, he would say: "We can't do it, why are you looking for me?"
    (3) The third type is a small number of people who give up on themselves and feel that they are not good enough anyway.
    Those who participated in the quiz thought, "There is no way, I have to participate." Those who did not participate in the quiz were thinking, "I'm glad I didn't participate, wouldn't I just fail if I did?" Some old staff members are afraid of quizzes and unwilling to study. Some have a cultural level that is not very low, but they don't study. Some sit with everyone to read books in order to obey the system, but they don't turn a page after more than an hour. Some cadres think that it is enough to do a good job, and there is no hurry to study (they don't know that learning is directly proportional to work. If you know how to learn, you will know how to do things, just like doing business by relying on old inventory and not selling much for long). In addition, comrades in rural work and those with low levels feel inferior, "People with cultural levels can still get ahead." These comrades should learn from Deng Yubao, Zhao He, Zhou Dianqing, Wang Demin, and other comrades.
    Third
    We must establish a regular quiz system in the future. Therefore, the results must be announced immediately after the quiz, and the time should not be delayed. In order to review the papers quickly, the best way is to have a collective review. This not only promotes overall learning, but also the act of grading papers is itself a form of learning. If the quiz does not produce results quickly, it will reduce the meaning and effect of the quiz. As for the democratic review method, this was done well by several agencies. But some have deviations, and the scoring standards are not uniform. The Tax Bureau is better. Therefore, when reviewing:
    1.  First, each group should discuss the test questions in detail, draw conclusions, and hand them over to the person in charge for summary and announcement, as the standard for correct answers, or the main person in charge (comrades with higher levels) should give a detailed explanation of the answers as the review standard.
    2.  A group of three to five people should be formed to jointly review their own test papers, without exchanging them. They should be allowed to express their opinions and cause disputes, so that they can be convinced. This method of review is not for dividing the work of looking at the papers, but mainly to improve everyone's understanding from the review, so that they can compare themselves and make their thinking consistent.
    3.  Correct the wrong ones, supplement the omissions, help them, and give opinions on each person's paper.
    4.  After the review, each group should hold a report, explain the problems found in the review, summarize the ideological deviations, and propose a learning plan based on the ideological situation. Those who fail should study again.
    Fourth
    Comrades with cultural levels have stronger comprehension abilities, faster learning progress, and can also gain more things; such as the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Tax Bureau, the New China teachers and staff, and the newspaper. Therefore, it illustrates the importance of learning culture. Many comrades from worker-peasant backgrounds feel that the discussions are good at ordinary times, but they don't know what to write when they write. All comrades with some cultural level, as long as they have studied, can answer relatively well in this quiz. Therefore, we call on comrades with low cultural levels to pay great attention to learning culture.

### 从测验中看到的几个问题

　　从测验中看到的几个问题
    中共鞍山市委宣传部
    这次举行政协文件学习测验是在前一星期就经过了准备与酝酿的。测验的举行比较严肃与正规。测验后又经过个别的与集体的汇报。所以对全市干部学习，一般的起了很大的推动作用，同时也暴露了属于学习领导上的好多问题。因此，我们这次测验与学习检查必须进行总结，以求得把学习向前推动一步。
  　第一
    这次参加学习政协文件的干部和职员（钢铁公司系统在外）一共是一九三○人。约占实有人数百分之八十六，现已实收到的参加测验名单和卷子是九八五人（有一部分还未送来）。没参加的人数是四六三人，测验成绩的总平均分是六一分，最高分数的单位总平均是八一分，最低分数的单位总平均是三二分。从测验中看，政协文件的学习，还是不深入的，成绩也不很好，因为测验还刺激了一下，否则，恐怕还不会有这种成绩。这说明了我们的干部学习还差，方法还得研究，同时制度也不正规，各机关学习也不平衡（有的根本没有学习）。因此，我们在学习方面有加以整顿与改进的必要。
  　第二
    测验能知道自己的进步，确能推动学习，但也有个别的机关漠然视之，为测验而学习，不过有的机关由偏差转入正途，从测验的推动而感觉到了学习的需要，有的单纯为了测验，测验结束就算是完成了任务，下面就是关于测验前后的几种思想表现：
    （一）感觉测验能推动与帮助学习，这是一种好的表现。
    １、测验以前，因为要做准备，所以普遍的紧张了，振作了，人人买书，没有通知买的也自动的买了（仅新华、西北两书店销售就有两三千本），电业局的职员，从公布试题以后，有的回家还学，一直学到夜深，好多人背的背，写的写，到处都是学习空气。
    ２、测验以后，对大家又是一个刺激，党训班的干部就认为：“这样测验测验好，不然还不知道我们天天学，到底学会没有，懂了多少。”有些没有参加的很懊悔，要求以后经常测验。不及格的特别努力，过去报纸只是一般的看，这次，大家争着看报纸，一定要争取“下次见面”，有的因为有工作没有参加测验的，找参加的同志要题目自己测验。工业区一个女同志第一次考五十多分，这次考六十多分，她说：“下次一定还得长十分”。另外一个同志向她挑战说：“下次我保证八十分”。还有很多文化水平低的同志，这次测验成绩很好，如七岭区邓玉宝，千山区的赵和，工业区的周殿清，铁东区的王德民都在八十二分以上。他们考的好，完全因为自己努力的结果，这样的同志应该表扬。
    ３、经过测验，普遍有了学习的要求，好多机关订立了制度，并且结合了工作，也提高了工作情绪，如工商局现在规定了每早跑步后，接着就学习，这样可以避免起不来和学习迟到的现象。他们的会计设法改变了工作方式，使得时间充裕了，可以抽出时间来学习。企业管理处、建设公司这些机关都变了，都经过了开会研究，市委本身也是如此，只是个别的如工会等机关还比较差，有些机关注意了业务，但在政治上学习是差的，这样也不对，业务比重大些，这是可以的，但是注重学政治、理论，还是必须的。 　 （二）为测验而学习，这是第二种表现。
    １、把报上公布的十五道题抄了下来，背诵、默写，有的死背条文一字不差。结果，测验时，发现有不是十五道题以内的，便埋怨上级没通知（实际报纸上也都公布过），有的悔恨自己不该背教条，感觉吃了亏不如不背，也有的已体会到背教条不是学习的好办法，下次一定要联系思想，真正领会文件的精神。
    ２、有的知道快要测验了。因为工人生活报上说抽题测验，所以，就“押”起题来，有说第一题一定有，有说第三题一定有，在押宝，谁押到谁合适，结果，也有对的，也有错的，这样人测验完啦，也就没事了。
    ３、有的测验前很积极，起早贪晚，准备应付战斗。但是测验完了，倒觉得轻快了，早上也不起来了，学习也不积极了，算是过了一“关”，有的问“以后还测验不测验”？在他也许认为最好不要再测验了。
    ４、有的机关怕丢人，测验时，派学习好些的参加，这样使总平均好看些。有的临阵脱逃，知道测验开了小差，或请个病假，甲组也如此。
    ５卷子评阅以后，斤斤计较分数，“我怎么比他少一分呢？他怎么比我多”，甚至人家向他说句话，他都说：“我们不行，找我干啥”。
    （三）第三种是少数人，自甘暴弃，反正不行。
    参加测验的认为“没法子，只好参加”，没有参加测验的在想“我幸亏没参加，参加还不是不及格”。一部分老职员怕测验又不愿学习。有的文化水平并不很低，也不学习。有的为了服从制度，和大家坐在一起看书，但一点多钟也不见他翻一页。也有的干部认为做好工作就行，学习不学习不着急（不知道学习与工作成正比，会学就会做，好比做买卖光凭点老货底卖不多久）。此外农村工作同志和水平低的同志感觉不如人，“还是有文化水平的吃得开”，这些同志应该向邓玉宝、赵和、周殿清、王德民这些同志看齐。
    第三
    今后必须建立经常的测验制度。因此，测验以后就得马上公布成绩，不要拖延时间，为了使卷子快点看完，最好的方法，是集体评阅。这样不仅推动了全体学习，而且评卷子本身就是个学习。测验如果不很快得出结果，便减低了测验的意义和效果。至于用民主评阅的方法这次好同几个机关做了。但有的有偏差，分数标准也不齐，税务局较好。因此，评阅时：
    一、首先由各小组把试题加以详细的讨论，得出结论，交给负责人归纳并集会公布，作为正确答案的标准，或由主要负责同志（水平较高的同志）将答案给以详细解释做为评阅标准。
    二、由三至五人组成小组，共同评阅该三至五人自己的试卷，不必交换，应允许自己发表意见并引起争论，这样也能使他服气。这种评法，不是为了看卷子而分工，主要的能从评阅中提高每个人的认识，可以对照自己，使得思想一致。
    三、不对的给以纠正，遗漏的给以补充，帮助他，并对每人卷子上提出意见。
    四、评完以后，各小组举行汇报，将评阅中所发现的问题给以解释，总结出思想偏差，根据思想情况提出学习计划，不及格的重新学习。
    第四
    有文化水平的同志，理解能力较强，学习进度也快，也能多得东西；如中苏友协、税务局、新中教职员、报社等。因此，说明了学习文化的重要。很多工农出身的同志，感觉平时讨论也不错，但一写就不知道写什么了。凡有些文化水平的同志，这次测验，只要学习过的，答的都还可以。因此，我们号召文化水平低的同志应该大力注意学习文化。
