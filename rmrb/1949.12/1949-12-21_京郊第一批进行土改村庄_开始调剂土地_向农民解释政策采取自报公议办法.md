　　The First Villages in the Suburbs of Beijing to Carry Out Land Reform
    Begin to Adjust Land
    Policies Explained to Farmers Using a Method of Self-Reporting and Public Discussion
    [Beijing News] Most of the first villages in the suburbs of Beijing to carry out land reform have entered the stage of land adjustment. A small number of villages have begun to distribute farm tools, livestock, houses, etc., and seven villages have successfully completed this process. The main focus of land adjustment is to solve the land problems of farm laborers and poor peasants, followed by poor and unemployed people who are willing to cultivate the land. The general method of adjustment is to divide the land to be distributed into several grades according to yield, taking into account the distance of the location, and then distribute it based on population, with reference to the original amount of land cultivated. The distribution goes through three processes: self-reporting and public discussion, review by the farmers' association (or farmers' representative meeting), and approval by a general meeting.

    Before adjusting land, each district underwent full deliberation and preparation. The Western Suburbs (Sixteenth District) first strengthened education for farmers. During self-reporting and public discussion in the Eastern Suburbs (Thirteenth District), each village first announced the number of acres to be extracted, and let typical households report first, so that everyone would have a basis when reporting. In the distribution of farm tools and livestock, the Southern Suburbs (Fourteenth District) extracted and distributed the surplus farm tools and livestock, except for those needed by landlords for their own production.

    　　　　Fully Mobilize the Masses and Raise Farmers' Awareness
    Experience has shown that in the process of adjusting land and distributing farm tools, it is necessary to follow the mass line, explain the policies clearly to the farmers, and require everyone to be selfless and impartial. In Yuzhu Village, Mentougou (Twentieth District), Youth League members took the lead in allowing other farmers to report first when adjusting land, demonstrating a fine style of being selfless and not caring about personal interests, which had a great impact on the masses. When the farmers' association deliberates on the distribution of fruits, non-members of the farmers' association should be invited to participate, which can not only enhance the prestige of the farmers' association but also unite all farmers more widely. In the distribution of fruits in Wulituo Village, Shijingshan, attention was paid to uniting non-members of the farmers' association, so farmers actively requested to join the farmers' association. Before collecting grain from landlords, a full investigation should be conducted before collection. Weimenkou Village in Shijingshan once convened a meeting of landlords, mobilizing them to report their own figures, encouraging those who were honest and exposing the true situation of those who were stubborn, which had a very good effect. The Fengtai (Fifteenth District) Farmers' Association was divided into three groups: investigation, registration, and storage, so that orderly division of labor and cooperation resulted in a well-organized distribution. Some deviations also occurred in the work of various districts: in the land adjustment in Guozhangzhuang, Beichangxindian, there was localism, and people were unwilling to let outsiders share the land; in the distribution of houses in Moshikou, Shijingshan, the method of drawing lots was used, which was not really based on the specific situation, so the distribution was not as fair and reasonable as possible. These deviations were discovered by the leaders of each district and corrected in a timely manner. On the 14th, the Beijing Municipal Suburbs Committee also instructed each district to pay attention to: (1) The distribution must be orderly and led. (2) The distribution steps should adopt the method of self-reporting and public discussion, and it should be explained to the landlords that they are not allowed to sabotage and should honestly listen to the distribution. Finally, people are selected to count, register, and distribute. (3) The distribution should be unified and should not affect next year's production. The spirit of class friendship should be fully developed. When distributing large farm tools jointly, it must be carried out on a voluntary basis.

    This land adjustment has fully mobilized the masses in various districts and greatly raised the class consciousness of the farmers. The masses are very satisfied with this fair and reasonable distribution method. They are determined to step up production in the future and move towards the direction of getting rich.

　　京郊第一批进行土改村庄
    开始调剂土地
    向农民解释政策采取自报公议办法
    【北京讯】京市郊区第一批进行土地改革的村庄，大部已进入调剂土地阶段。少数村庄已开始分配农具、牲畜、房屋等，已有七个村庄胜利完成。在调剂土地上主要是解决雇农与贫农土地问题，其次是愿意种地的贫苦的失业人民。调剂办法一般是把应分配的土地按产量分为若干等级，并照顾位置的远近，再参照种地的原有土地数量，以人口为单位分配之。分配时经过自报公议、农会（或农代会）审核、大会通过等三个过程。
    各区在调剂土地之前，都经过充分酝酿与准备。西郊（十六区）首先加强对农民的教育。自报公议时，东郊（十三区）各村先公布抽出土地数字，让典型户先报，大家报时好有所依据。在分配农具牲畜中，南郊（十四区）除留作地主本人生产所需农具外多余的农具、牲畜抽出来加以分配。
    　　　　充分发动群众　提高农民觉悟
    在调剂土地及分配农具等过程中，经验证明，必须走群众路线，把政策向农民解释清楚，人人应大分无私。门头沟（二十区）在峪村青年团员在调剂土地时让其他农民先报，表现了大公无私，不计较个人利益的优良作风，对群众影响很大。农会审议分配果实时，应吸收非农会会员参加，这样不但能提高农会威信，并可更广泛地团结全体农民。石景山五里坨等村分配果实中，注意了团结非农会会员，因此农民纷纷要求加入农会。征收地主粮食前要经过充分调查，然后予以征收。石景山卫门口村曾召集地主开会，动员地主自报数字，对老实的加以鼓励，顽固的就揭破他的实况，效果极好。丰台（十五区）农会分调查、登记、保管三组，这样有秩序的分工合作，分配时则有条不紊。各区在工作中也发生了一些偏向：北长辛店郭张庄调剂土地中，有本位主义思想，不愿外来人分地；石景山模式口在分配房屋时，用抽签的办法，不是真正根据具体情况，使分配的尽量公平合理。这些偏向经各区领导上发现后，都已及时纠正。京市郊委于十四日又指示各区注意：（一）分配时必须有秩序、有领导。（二）分配步骤采自报公议办法并向地主讲明不准破坏，老老实实听候分配。最后选人去清点、登记、分配。（三）要统一分配，不要影响明年生产，充分发扬阶级友爱精神，在合伙分配大农具时，必须在自愿结合下进行。
    此次调剂土地，各区都充分发动了群众，大大提高了农民的阶级觉悟。群众对这种公平合理的分配办法都感到非常满意。他们决心今后加紧生产，朝着发家致富的方向走去。
