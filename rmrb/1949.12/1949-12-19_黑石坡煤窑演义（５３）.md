　　Da San retreated to the corner again and squatted down, and the meeting was momentarily at a loss of what to do. Lao Yin, Shuan Cheng, and a large group of people slowly surrounded Da San, quietly trying to persuade him, while the people on this side were also gossiping in small voices. Only Lao Bai stood by the stove, staring straight at Da San. After a long while, as if he had mustered all his strength, he trembled his lips and shouted at Da San: "How is your head put together? Our liberation and emancipation are not for everyone to work and eat? We have also dealt with the Qian Danao and Yu Bao crowd, and Tai Cheng and Niu Bao earned work points through their efforts, and you won't even let them work? Could it be that you want them to starve? Not to mention that you are delaying the big affairs of the whole village, you are making a scene in front of the Qian Danao crowd, and it makes it seem like our workers are internally discordant, aren't you afraid of being laughed at? Hmph! You are a worker! Even if you are backward, there should be an end to it!" Da San immediately rushed to the middle of the meeting and said: "Am I, Zhang Yuanlu, really unwilling to work? For so many years, I have been so jealous of this big mine that my eyes are burning. Everyone looks up to me now and lets me work, okay, I'll do it! What I said just now was all wrong, and I admit my mistake! But we are opening the mine for everyone! I have to make it clear to everyone: I admit my mistake, but I just can't figure out what I said before! If you all think my attitude is okay, then I'll do it!" The Qian Danao crowd below quietly discussed wanting to withdraw their shares. Little Foreign Devil hurried over to block them. Tai Cheng also stood up angrily, wanting to shout that he wouldn't do it, but Shuan Cheng went up and stopped him. Lao Yin took Da San outside to persuade him. The cadres were connecting here and there, trying to resolve people's opinions on Da San. The meeting slowly calmed down. When Lao Yin and Da San came back, Da San was also much softer. He said to everyone: "I think I'm backward, I'll slowly change my thinking later. Everyone, please let me take a step, I'll always make progress anyway. But if you want me to do it, I have one more thing to say." People said: "Say it!" "You have to allow me attitude!" Most people at the meeting couldn't help but burst into laughter! Little Foreign Devil said: "You've seen the rules, anyway, you can say what you need to say, right?" Da San said: "No, it has to be said first! In the meeting, everyone is the boss, anyone can bring up anything, whoever is stronger than me, I'd rather worship them as a teacher and be an apprentice; but once I'm down in the mine, I'm the boss! Don't let me say what needs to be said because of democracy or whatever." Lao Yin came out and explained the leadership rules for a while. Shuan Cheng said with a smile: "It's nothing! Uncle Da San, Uncle Xi Lu and I are the managers, and you are still a consultant when you are down in the mine! If your attitude is not right, we can also say something to you!" Everyone below said in unison: "Right!" and laughed again, Da San couldn't help but smile too.
    The meeting went on seriously. Shuan Cheng proposed that the mine should have rules, and no one should violate them. The meeting unanimously passed the proposal and asked the shareholder representatives to draft a preliminary version first. Then, someone raised the question of how many shares Xi Lu should have in the mine. Xi Lu hurriedly shouted: "Our mine has long been ruined and abandoned! Now everyone is paying for the capital and working together with one heart. We didn't contribute any money or effort. It's already a blessing from heaven that my father and son can earn a supply by working! Don't mention how many shares there are, or we'll withdraw our shares and not do it." Everyone gossiped for a while, feeling that opening a mine was a money-losing business anyway, and the matter of shares was not a big deal. Xi Lu insisted on only counting labor shares, so it was decided to start working first and talk about it when the mine was successful; Xi Lu still didn't agree, and after everyone tried to persuade him, he finally stayed. Finally, the discussion turned to wages. Everyone decided to implement fixed wages, receiving rice according to labor, and later dividing profits according to the amount of labor each person contributed. Wages were divided into three to five catties of millet per work unit for water workers, diggers, carriers, idle workers, water worker leaders, branch managers, and idle worker leaders. Managers and bookkeepers received four catties. Only the foreman, some said five or six catties, and some said eight catties. There was a lot of arguing, and later Da San said: "I won't talk about supplies, I'll just work first! If there's no food, I'll take some and record it on the account, and talk about it when the mine is successful." People thought he was just being difficult again and didn't agree, but he repeatedly stated that he was sincere; Lao Bai said: "If he wants to be difficult, let him be, forget it." Everyone argued for a while before agreeing to him. At this time, he said again: "Everyone who has shares has to work!" People said: "That goes without saying!" But Liu Goujia shouted: "What am I supposed to do? I'm a manager and foreman!" Little Foreign Devil said: "Look, I forgot about you! What kind of trouble are you making! Go away! Who agreed to you buying shares!" Liu Goujia quickly said: "Go away, you little foreign devil! I'm an old useless person, if I don't find a way to live, what will I eat? I think, my voice is loud, I'll call people!" People started joking with her, but she stubbornly and seriously declared again and again: she really wanted to find something to do! Isn't this also intentionally being difficult? Da San suddenly shouted: "I have an idea! Let Goujia be 'tally'!" In an instant, everyone laughed and said: "Right!" "Support!" Only Lao Yin didn't understand what "tally" meant. Lao Bai told him: that was when the East Mine was draining water, she would sit beside the first water wheel at the mine entrance and count the number of water buckets; Lao Yin couldn't help but nod and smile. Da San said again: "But I have to say it first! The elders didn't allow women to enter the mine, don't say I offended Lord Lao later!" People argued: "Who's talking about that now!" Little Foreign Devil shouted again: "Liu Goujia, don't look at how cold it is, but people wear half-legged revealing pants when they go down into the mine! I don't even wear revealing pants when I go down into the mine! You're not allowed to be afraid then!" Liu Goujia chased after the Little Foreign Devil with her dry tobacco pipe, and the people next to them also crowded up, pushing the two of them together, fighting and making noise, stirring into a团.
　　Fifty Draining Water
    The village lent the mine seven hundred silver dollars, and the mine's furniture and expenses were quickly arranged properly. Tian Lu secretly led most of the miners to worship Lord Lao. The shareholders' meeting also passed the rules and discipline, and the manpower was also properly allocated: Tai Cheng was still in charge of the West Mine, Tian Lu was the water worker leader of the East Mine, Liu Goujia and Little Foreign Devil took turns tallying, and after Lin Bao finished the land account, he was invited to the mine to manage the sale of coal and help Xi Lu manage the cabinet room; the cabinet room was also renovated, and the big fire at the mine also started up, and the Little Foreign Devil also set up a fire at the tallying location; Tian Lu was even more digging water ditches and installing water wheels all day long... In a few days, everything was ready, and the big mine became lively day and night in three shifts.
    On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth lunar month, the first shift started draining water, and Da San tried draining it himself. Liu Goujia found ten copper coins, strung them on a hemp rope, and hung the hemp rope by the stove. Every time Da San drained a bucket, she would dial down a coin. After dialing down all ten, she would draw a line on the coal wall with white ash and then start dialing the coins from the beginning to count. On this side, Da San was wearing a pair of half-legged shorts, with bare legs and feet, and a worn-out cotton-padded jacket on his upper body, showing that his whole body's tendons and bones were bursting with energy, looking like a good strong man who was only in his early thirties; he silently held his breath and drained bucket after bucket of water, each bucket full, and then poured it into the wooden trough with force, and the water flowed straight out. Before the first bucket had finished flowing out, the second bucket was poured in! People lit incense to record the time, and Lao Yin took out his watch to watch. In eight hours, Da San only took four short breaks and drained a total of one thousand eight hundred and fifty-odd buckets! Inside and outside the mine, whether they were shareholders or not, whether they were from the village or from other villages, and even women and children, everyone shouted: "No ambiguity!" "It really pisses off the young men!" There's no way to say it! The mine finally decided on one thousand five hundred buckets per shift.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（５３）
    康濯
    大三又退回墙角圪蹴去了，会上一时都＠＠地不知怎么办；老尹拴成一大伙，慢慢围上大三，悄悄打劝起来，这边人们也才三三两两小声咯嚷。只有老白站在火炉边，两眼直直地瞅着大三，老大一会，他象憋足了多大的劲，嘴哆嗦着对大三嚷道：“你那脑袋是怎么长着的啊？咱们翻身解放，还不是为了大伙都劳动都吃饭？乾大脑玉宝们咱也处理了，泰成牛宝们那记工也是他出了力的，你就连他们动弹也不让？莫非你要让他们挨饿？甭说你这耽误浑村大事吧，你当着乾大脑们这么闹，显得咱工人内里不和宜的，也不怕人家笑话？哼！你是个工人！你落后也该有个头啊！”大三紧接着却猛冲到会场中间，说道：“我张远禄莫非就真不乐意干？这多年来，我一见这大窑就眼红得冒火，大伙这会又看的起我，让我动弹，我行，我干！刚才我那些都不对，我也认错！可咱这是为了大伙开窑！我有话都跟大伙表明：错咱是认错，要说我前边说的那些，我肚里就是闹不通！大伙看着我这架势要是行，我就干！”下边乾大脑们悄悄捣拉开想退股了，小洋鬼忙跑去挡住，泰成也气愤愤地立起来，想吆喝着不干，拴成跟上去制住了他；老尹把大三拉到外边解劝去了，干部们就在这里那里窜连着，想法解开人们对大三的意见，会场才慢慢平和下来，等老尹大三回来，大三也软和多了，他对大伙道：“我认为落后，等我下去慢慢思想改正，众大伙算是让我一步吧，我反正总得进步。可要叫我干的话，我还有一句话得说说。”人们道：“说吧！”“得许我动态度！”会上多数人不觉哄笑起来！小洋鬼说：“你那章程人们也见过的，反正把式上头，该说的还能不兴你说？”大三道：“不，话得说在先！会场上嘛，大伙是掌柜的，谁有什么也兴提，谁比我强，我宁愿拜师父当徒弟；可下了窑底，我就是掌柜！别日后又是民主什么的，该说的也不让我说。”老尹出来把这领导的规章说了一阵，拴成笑说道：“这没什么！大三叔，我跟咱喜禄叔是经理了，下了窑你还好赖大点子哩！你要态度不对付，可也得兴咱俩说你！”下边都齐声说：“对！”并又哄笑起来，大三不觉也笑了。
    会又正经讨论下去。拴成提出窑上要闹个章程，大家谁也不许违法，会上一音通过，并让股东代表先闹个底底。接着，有人提出这窑喜禄到底该算多少股子，喜禄急忙忙嚷道：“咱这窑早就毁了撂了的哩！这如今大伙掏垫本出力气齐心一体来拾掇，咱钱没出钱力没力气，咱父儿俩倒能动弹挣供应的，这就好上天啦！快别提股多股少的，要不咱退股不干了。”大家咯嚷了一阵，觉得一开窑反正是赔钱买卖，股不股的事不大，喜禄又一个劲拧住只算身股，于是决定先动弹，窑成了再说；喜禄却还不答应，大伙你劝我说的，他才呆了下来。最后讨论工资，大家决定实行硬资，按工领米，日后并按各人工的多少，折股分红；工资按水工、刨头、担头、闲工、水工头、领岔的、闲工头，又分成每工三斤到五斤小米不等，经理、司账都是四斤。只有领事，有说五斤六斤，还有说八斤的，咯嚷得工夫不小，后来大三说：“我不说供应，先干！没吃的，我取点，给记上账，赶窑闹成了再说。”人们只当他又是闹蹩扭，都不赞成，但他再三表明：他是真心实意；老白说：“他要闹蹩就闹吧，算了。”大伙又咯吵了一会，才同意了他。这时他又说：“入了股的可都得动弹！”人们道：“那还用说！”柳沟家却嚷了起来：“我可干什么营生啊？我的个经理领事的！”小洋鬼道：“你看我倒把你忘了！我说你又闹什么风流哩！去你的吧！谁同意你入股来着！”柳沟家忙道：“去你的小洋鬼的吧！咱一个老无用的，不找个生活，可吃什么？我看，我这嗓音高，我给叫人吧！”人们跟她耍笑开了，但她却古板正经地再三声言：她可是真要找个干的！这不也是存心闹蹩扭么？大三忽然吆喝道：“有了！沟家‘打点’吧！”一刹时谁都哄笑着道：“对！”“拥护！”只有老尹不懂“打点”是干什么，老白就告他：那是东窑打水的时候，让她坐在窑口头一道旋旁边，计算打水的壳篓数；老尹不觉也点头笑了。大三却又道：“话可得说在头里！老辈不是不许妇女进窑的，后日不要又说我冲犯老君爷！”人们咯吵道：“这会还说那哩！”小洋鬼却又嚷起来：“柳沟家，你甭看天冷，可人们下窑都是穿半截露肉裤子的哩！我下窑是连露肉裤子也不穿！到时候可不许你着怕呀！”柳沟家伸着旱烟管死追着小洋鬼，旁边人们也哄哄地挤了上去，把他两个推到一堆，打打闹闹地，直咯搅成一团。
  　五十　打水
    村里借给了窑上七百块现洋，窑上家具、花销很快安排妥贴，天禄并领着多数窑黑私下里敬了老君爷，股东大会又通过了章程和纪律，人马也拨调停当：西窑还是泰成经管，东窑天禄的水工头，柳沟家和小洋鬼轮流打点，林宝作完了土地帐，又请他上窑场管卖炭并帮喜禄管柜房；柜房又修正了，窑场上的大火也生起来了，小洋鬼并在打点的地势也盘了个火；天禄更是整日刨水沟、安旋……不几天，万事停当，大窑又日夜三班热闹起来。
    腊月二十五，第一班开工打水，大三自己试打。柳沟家寻了十个制钱，穿在一根麻绳上，麻绳吊在火炉边，大三每打一壳篓，她就往下拨一个钱，拨完了十个，就在煤墙上用大灰划一道道，再从头拨钱记数。这边大三穿了条半截短裤，光着腿脚，上身一件破夹袄，显出浑身筋骨都往外冒着劲气，看来怎么也只象个三十开外的好壮年；他不声不响，摒住气一壳篓一壳篓地往上打水，每一壳篓水都挺满，再使劲倒进木槽，水便直往外流，头一壳篓的还没有流完，第二壳篓就又倒进去了！人们点着香记时间，老尹掏出自己的表看着，八个钟头，大三只小歇四回，共打了一千八百五十几壳篓！窑里窑外是股东的、不是股东的，本村的、外村的，还有妇女儿童，谁个不嚷着：“不含糊！”“真他妈气死年轻汉！”没说的！窑上最后决定了每班一千五百壳篓。
