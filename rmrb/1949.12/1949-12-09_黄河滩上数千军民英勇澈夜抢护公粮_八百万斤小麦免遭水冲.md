　　Thousands of Soldiers and Civilians Heroically Rescued Public Grain Overnight on the Yellow River Beach
    Eight Million Jin of Wheat Saved from Flooding
    [Reported by this newspaper] The people of Jinan City, thousands strong, rescued public grain, demonstrating boundless enthusiasm for protecting state property. The Pingyuan General Branch of the North China Grain Transportation Company transported over 40,000 bags of wheat, totaling over eight million jin, via water from the upper reaches of the Yellow River. It was stored on the vast silt滩 (tan - shallow water or beach) between the Old Xuzhuang Dangerous Project and the Xiaoluzhuang Dangerous Project, piled up like mountains. Originally, the Yellow River's water flow decreases in winter, and the main current returns to its original course. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 30th of last month, the water situation began to change. The main current, from the Dawangmiao Dangerous Project in Qihe territory on the opposite bank, rushed directly to the Old Xuzhuang silt滩, causing the滩 to be scoured and collapse, stretching about 500 meters, with the灘 bank being about 5 meters steep and the water being about 4 meters deep, with a fierce current. The wheat bag stacks were only 3 meters away from falling into the floodwaters, and it seemed that millions of jin of wheat were about to be washed away. In this serious situation, the Jinan-Qinghe Winter Repair Headquarters and the Jinan Yellow River Management Office, upon receiving the news, immediately led all cadres to rush to the rescue. They also separately telegraphed to higher levels and urgently mobilized over a thousand people, including winter repair workers from the entire river, flood prevention teams, and surveying teams, to participate in the rescue. Hundreds of people, including the Luokou Public Security Police Station, the Waterborne Public Security Police Station, the Luokou Town Government Transport Team, and dock workers, also rushed to the scene. Villagers from Yaoshan, Wangfu, Biaoshan, Huanggang, and other villages along the river in the Eleventh District spontaneously went to participate. Winter repair workers from the Dawangmiao Dangerous Project in Qihe on the opposite bank also crossed the river that night to provide assistance. Over two hundred people from the Railway Bureau's Public Security Department, over a hundred people from the Municipal Public Security Bureau's forces, and over a hundred people from a certain unit of the Municipal Garrison also rushed to the rescue. Responsible cadres from the provincial and municipal people's governments rushed to the scene overnight to provide personal guidance. Thanks to the rapid concentration of manpower and everyone's enthusiasm for protecting public grain, in the overnight rescue struggle, nearly 50,000 bags of wheat, each weighing over two hundred jin, were transported to a safe area, reversing between escaping old dangers and encountering new ones.
