How Did Yanjing Paper Mill Reduce Costs?

The Beijing Public-owned Yanjing Paper Mill has recently achieved significant results in increasing production, improving quality, and reducing costs. During the Japanese occupation, the factory's two machines produced a maximum of 200 reams of paper per day; during the Kuomintang rule, one machine produced a maximum of only 70 or 80 reams per day, and most of it was unsellable due to poor quality. After liberation, in September, the factory's daily paper production reached over 240 reams. Moreover, the quality has been improving month by month. Before September, substandard paper accounted for more than half of the total production; even in the best months, substandard paper accounted for 21 percent, and damaged paper accounted for 6 percent. There were many pinholes in the paper, and the quality was uneven, which seriously affected sales. According to statistics, only about 1,800 reams were sold each month. After September, substandard paper was reduced to 17 percent, and in October it was reduced to 8.8 percent. Statistics for the first ten days of November showed that substandard paper was only 0.68 percent, with fewer pinholes and more even quality. As a result, the sales problem was solved. Monthly paper sales have now increased to 7,707 reams.

The factory was able to achieve these results due to the following reasons:

First, a factory-wide anti-waste campaign was launched to find ways to reduce electricity and coal consumption, as well as other unnecessary expenses. In the past, the rotary cutter (used for trimming paper) kept rotating regardless of the amount of paper. Now, it is only turned on when there are at least five reams of paper to be cut. In the past, the pulping team used to operate three machines, but now, in order to save electricity, only two machines are operated, and the same task is completed. In the past, the machine was turned on as soon as the materials were loaded, wasting a lot of electricity. Now, the machine is only turned on after half of the materials are loaded, saving one hour of electricity per day. Workers in the boiler room voluntarily collect unburnt small pieces of coal, saving an average of more than 130 catties of coal per day. In terms of coal and electricity, each ream of paper now uses one kilowatt-hour less electricity and two and a half catties less coal than before. Significant savings have also been achieved in other materials such as felt, equipment, and machine oil. The top felt used in the paper machine used to be replaced every period, but now it is used for at least half a month.

Second, everyone is finding ways to improve technology. In order to improve the quality of paper, the factory established a small laboratory to test the quality of paper, ensuring reliable bleaching, and to test the effectiveness of rosin, alum, and pigments. Workers can come up with their own solutions to technical and other difficulties. For example, in the past, two shredders and four grinders were needed to supply one and a half paper machines. After everyone brainstormed, it was discovered that in the past, dry materials were added and watered with tap water, which easily caused blockages, resulting in insufficient shredded material and a lot of sand (causing pinholes). Later, everyone came up with the idea of soaking the materials first, which not only made the materials go down faster but also removed sand and reduced pinholes in the paper. The test results showed that now only one shredder and two grinders are needed to supply materials for two paper machines. When it was discovered that paper materials were easily damaged by hot air, worker Huang Wencai came up with a solution of adding a wire mesh, and this difficulty was also overcome. Most of the factory's workers have three or four years of experience and have certain skills. Combining this with their enthusiasm for production has made it possible to solve various difficulties in production.

Third, appropriately addressing workers' welfare issues. For example, in the past, workers who fell ill were not taken care of. Now, a clinic has been established (serious illnesses are sent to nearby hospitals, and medical expenses are subsidized by the factory depending on the circumstances). The problem of workers' dormitories has also been solved. Other issues, such as glasses and gloves for workers in the iron workshop, aprons and masks for workers in the raw materials department, and gas masks for workers in the pulping department, have all been properly addressed, greatly improving workers' morale.

Fourth, the factory management staff have transformed their old work style of standing over the workers and managing them. They are now able to truly work with the workers and become one with them, helping workers improve their skills and discovering and solving problems in a timely manner. The unity between the management staff and the workers has increased production.

Fifth, timely inspection of finished product quality and establishment of a shift handover system. In the past, the factory did not have an inspection system, and no one cared about the quality of the products. Now, the production committee conducts a general inspection every day, and each production unit conducts its own inspections at any time. If any bad paper is found, it is repaired. In the past, the factory did not have a shift handover system. Once, due to a lack of communication between the people handing over and taking over shifts, three or four hundred catties of rosin were ruined, and production was delayed. Now, during shift handover, the machines and raw materials are clearly handed over, so that the incoming workers can smoothly start the machines and continue production.

　　燕京造纸厂是怎样减低成本的？
    京市公营燕京造纸厂，在增加生产、提高质量、减低成本各方面，最近已获得显著成绩。该厂在日寇统治时期，两部机器，每天出纸最多二百令；国民党统治时期，一部机器，每天出纸最高只七、八十令，且由于纸质坏，大部卖不出去。解放后，该厂在九月份，每天产纸已达二百四十令以上。而且质量也是逐月提高，九月份以前，该厂不合格的纸即占二分之一以上，最好的月份，不合格的纸也占百分之二十一，损纸占百分之六，纸上沙眼多，纸质不匀，严重的影响了销路，据统计每月只销售一千八百多令。九月份以后，不合标准的纸已减至百分之十七，十月份减至百分之八点八。十一月中旬十天统计：不合标准纸仅有百分之点六八，而且沙眼少，纸质也匀。这样，销路问题也就获得解决。现每月售纸已增至七千七百零七令。从成本上看：六月份每令纸的成本合小米六十八斤，十一月份合五十四斤，平均每令纸的成本减少了十四斤米。
    该厂所以能获得这些成绩，是由于以下几个原因：
    第一、全厂开展了反浪费运动。在想办法减少用电、用煤，及其它不必要开支方面。该厂过去转刀（裁纸用的）不管纸多纸少一直在转动，现在不集中五令纸就不开动。打浆二班过去开动三部机器工作，现在为了节省电力，只开动两部，同样也完成了和过去相同的任务。过去是一放料子就开动机器，浪费了不少电，现在要等放上一半料子时再开机器，这样每天就节省了一小时的电力。锅炉房工人自动拣未烧透的小煤块，平均每天即可节省煤一百三十多斤。煤电方面，每令纸比过去已少用一个电字和二斤半煤。其它毛布、器材、机器油，都比过去节省了许多。抄纸机用的上毛布，过去每时期换一次，现在起码要用半个月。
    第二、大家想办法改进技术。该厂为了提高纸的质量，特成立小型试验室，试验纸的质量，使漂白有把握，又试验松香、＠土、颜料的效能。遇到技术与其他困难等问题，工人都能自己来想办法。如过去两部碎料机、四部碾子，才能供给一部半抄纸机，经过大家想办法，检查出过去放干料子，另外用自来水浇，使料子容易堵塞，碎出料子不够用，而且沙子多（出沙眼）；后经大家想出先泡料子的办法，既使料子下得快，又能清除沙子，减少纸上的沙眼。试验的结果，现在只用一部碎料机两部碾子，就能供给两部抄纸机用料子。当发现纸料子容易为热气吹坏时，工人黄文才想出一个办法，加添了一个铁丝网，这个困难也被克服。该厂大部工人都有三、四年的工龄，都有一定的技术，再和他们的生产热情结合起来，就使生产中的各种困难得到解决。
    第三、适当解决工人的福利问题。比如，该厂过去工人病了没人管，现在已建立了卫生所（重病送附近医院，药费由厂方根据情形补助）。工人宿舍问题也已解决，其它如铁工班工人的眼镜、手套，原料部工人的围裙、口罩，打浆部工人的防毒面具，都得到适当解决。使工人生产情绪大大提高。
    第四、工务人员转变了过去站在工人头上管工人的老作风，已能真正和工人一块工作打成一片，并帮助工人提高技术，及时发现与解决问题。由于工务人员与工人的团结，提高了生产。
    第五、及时检查成品质量，建立交班制度。该厂过去没有检查制度，产品好坏没有人管，现在开始由生产委员每天作总的检查，各生产单位则随时自己检查，一发现有坏纸，就进行修理。该厂过去没有交班制度，有一次由于交班人互不通气，坏了三、四百斤松香，还耽误了生产。现在交班时将机器、原料都交代清楚，使接班工人能顺利开动机器，进行生产。
