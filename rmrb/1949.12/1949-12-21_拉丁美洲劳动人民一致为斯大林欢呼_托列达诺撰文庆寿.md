Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: According to TASS news: Toledano, President of the Latin American Labor Federation, published an article in the Soviet Labor newspaper on the 16th entitled "A Friend of the Common People" to celebrate Stalin's birthday.

　　Toledano first pointed out that the builders of the new socialist world, and the working men and women of imperialist countries, semi-colonies, and colonies, are watching Stalin and, under his guidance, are moving towards freedom and happiness. Today, when American imperialists are instigating a new war to dominate the world, the powerful forces of peace and democracy, headed by the Soviet Union, are blocking the path of the war-makers, and Stalin is the standard-bearer of this resolute struggle.

　　Toledano continued, the working men and women of Latin America do not want to be colonial slaves of Wall Street. This is why the Latin American working class, in addition to carrying out constant arduous struggles for basic rights, must also firmly raise the banner of struggle for peace. The conspiracy of American monopoly capitalists and their agents to smash independent Latin American trade union organizations and hinder their struggle for the interests of the working people has failed. The Latin American labor movement has victoriously defeated the attacks of splitters and has turned to the counter-offensive.

　　Toledano emphasized that the image of Stalin, the leader and friend of all progressive mankind, inspires the laboring people of distant Latin America who are engaged in arduous struggles. In every corner of Latin America, this dear and affectionate name is praised. In the mines of Chilean miners, in the homes of Venezuelan oil workers, Stalin's portrait is hung. When two strangers mention Stalin's name to each other, they become friends and brothers. In celebrating Stalin's 70th birthday, the laboring people of Latin America will unite more closely in struggle.

　　Toledano concluded: Stalin's great achievements, his firm belief in the bright future of all nations, and his deep love for the workers have won him the utmost love and respect of all mankind. The Latin American Labor Federation, together with the common people of the world, cheers for Comrade Stalin and prays for Comrade Stalin's longevity for the welfare of all the people of the world.

　　拉丁美洲劳动人民一致为斯大林欢呼
    托列达诺撰文庆寿
    【新华社北京二十日电】据塔斯社消息：拉丁美洲劳工联合会主席托列达诺，十六日在苏联劳动报上发表题为“平民的挚友”一文，为斯大林祝寿。
    托列达诺首先指出：社会主义新世界的建设者，和帝国主义国家、半殖民地与殖民地的劳动男女，都注视着斯大林，并在他的指示之下，走向自由和幸福的道路。在美帝国主义者为称霸世界而鼓动新战争的今日，以苏联为首的强大的和平与民主力量，正阻塞着战争制造者的道路，而斯大林则是这种坚决斗争的力量的旗手。
    托列达诺继称，拉丁美洲的男女工人，不愿当华尔街的殖民地奴隶，这是拉丁美洲的工人阶级为什么除了为基本权利而进行经常的艰苦斗争之外，还要坚定地举起为和平而斗争的旗帜的原因。美国垄断资本家及其代理人想粉碎独立的拉丁美洲工会组织并阻碍其为劳动人民利益而斗争的阴谋破产了，拉丁美洲的劳工运动胜利地击败了分裂者的进袭，且转入了反攻。
    托列达诺强调指出全体进步人类的领袖和朋友斯大林的形象，鼓舞着进行艰苦斗争的遥远的拉丁美洲劳动人民。拉丁美洲每一个角落都传颂着这个亲爱而又亲切的名字，在智利矿工的矿坑里，在委内瑞拉石油工人的家里，都挂着斯大林的肖像，当两个陌生人之间互相提到斯大林的名字时，他们就变成了朋友和兄弟。在庆祝斯大林的七十寿辰时，拉丁美洲的劳动人民将在斗争中团结得更紧密。
    托列达诺结语称：斯大林巨大的功绩，他对各民族人民光辉未来的坚定信念，他对劳动者的深挚的爱，使他受到全人类莫大的爱戴与尊敬。拉丁美洲劳工联合会与全世界的平民，一同为斯大林同志欢呼，并为全世界人民的福利祝祷斯大林同志万寿无疆。
