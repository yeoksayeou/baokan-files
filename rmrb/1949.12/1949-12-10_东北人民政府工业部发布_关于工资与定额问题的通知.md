Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 8th: After the widespread launch of the movement to create new production records in all state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government promptly issued a "Notice on Wage and Quota Issues." The notice emphasized: To consolidate the enthusiasm of the workers in the movement to create new production records, avoid labor turnover, and fix the main, more skilled workers in specific production positions, it is necessary to correctly solve the wage and quota problems. Because the stipulation of reasonable quotas is also a prerequisite for the formulation of correct production plans and the establishment of an economic accounting system. The notice clearly pointed out:

(1) The current wage system is unreasonable, with very little distinction between skilled technical labor and unskilled labor, and very little distinction between heavy labor and light labor. This phenomenon must be reasonably resolved through the movement to create new production records.

(2) In the movement to create new production records, it is necessary to increase the wages of skilled technical workers and workers engaged in heavy labor who play a major role in industry and mining. Only in this way can we conform to the principle of "equal pay for equal work." Because the value created by technical workers and ordinary workers in the same period is completely different, and only in this way can we encourage all workers to more actively learn technology and improve their skills. Therefore, raising wages should not be an egalitarian increase; a general increase in wages is unreasonable.

(3) After labor productivity is improved through the movement to create new production records, the average wage of workers should be higher than the current level (i.e., appropriately increased with the increase in labor productivity). It is absolutely not permissible that after the movement to create new records, labor efficiency is universally improved, but the workers' wages remain at the original wage level without any increase; it is even more impermissible that after the movement to create new records, the amount of wages workers receive is reduced. The increase in wages should be implemented in accordance with the principles stipulated in Article 2.

(4) In the past, there was also egalitarianism in wages between heavy industry and light industry. In order to change this situation, the proportion of wage increases should also be different according to different enterprise sectors. The specific increase figures should be submitted to the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government for approval by the Finance and Economics Committee.

(5) Currently, there are two erroneous views on technical quotas among employees and cadres: one is that the old technical quotas (or Manchukuo standards) that have always existed cannot be changed, and that the Manchukuo standards should be used as the standard for technical quotas, and that as long as this quota is exceeded, an excess reward (or excess wage) should be given; the other is that technical quotas must be raised to the highest new record standard. It is wrong to stipulate technical quotas according to these two views. The quota we need is between the new record achieved by advanced producers and the technical standards that naturally exist now, and it is a standard that can be achieved by ordinary employees under normal active working conditions.

(6) In order to better complete the quota work, all factories and mines should quickly establish a systematic and meticulous statistical and registration work in the movement to create new records; and gradually carry out technical calibration.

(7) The main quotas of each factory and mine must be completed in late December and reported to the ministry for approval. From next year, the movement to create new production records will be combined with excess rewards.

(8) Factories and mines that have already implemented piece-rate wages, because some technical quotas were unreasonable in the past, and because of the improvement of labor attitude or technology and operation methods in the movement to create new records, have generally exceeded them by a large amount. Now, wages should be adjusted immediately in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 and 3, and jointly studied with the Communist Party branch and the trade union, and the quota should be changed in accordance with the provisions of Article 5, and the wages of time-rate workers related to this work should be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Article 2.

### 东北人民政府工业部发布“关于工资与定额问题的通知”

　　东北人民政府工业部发布
    “关于工资与定额问题的通知”
    【新华社沈阳八日电】当全东北国营工矿各企业创造生产新纪录运动广泛开展以后，东北人民政府工业部及时发布了“关于工资与定额问题的通知”。通知着重指出：要巩固职工群众在创造生产新纪录运动中的积极性，避免劳动力的流动，把主要的较为熟练的工人固定在一定的生产岗位上，必须正确地解决工资与定额的问题。因为合理定额的规定，也是正确的生产计划的制定与经济核算制建立的前提。通知明确指出：
    （一）目前的工资制度是不合理的，熟练的技术劳动与不熟练劳动区别很小，繁重劳动与轻易劳动的区别很小。这种现象，必须经过创造生产新纪录运动加以合理解决。
    （二）在创造生产新纪录运动中，要提高在工矿中起主要作用的熟练的技术工人与劳动繁重的工人的工资。只有这样，才符合“按劳得值”的原则。因为技术工人与普通工人在同一时期内所创造的价值是完全不同的，而且也只有这样才能鼓励所有的工人更积极地学习技术，提高技术。因此，提高工资，不是来一个平均主义的提高；一般地提高工资是不合理的。
    （三）经过创造生产新纪录运动而劳动生产力提高以后，工人的平均工资应高于现在的水平（即随劳动生产率的提高而适当提高）。绝对不能是经过创造新纪录运动以后，劳动效率普遍提高了，而工人的工资仍停留在原来工资水平不加提高；更不能是经过创造新纪录运动以后，工人所得工资数量反而降低了。工资的提高，应根据第二条规定原则执行。
    （四）过去重工业与轻工业之间的工资也存在着平均主义。为了改变这种情况，工资的提高应按照不同的企业部门，其提高的比例亦应不同。具体提高数字应呈请东北人民政府工业部转请财政经济委员会批准。
    （五）目前在职工及干部中对于技术定额有两种错误的说法：一种是认为不能改变一向存在的陈旧的技术定额（或伪满标准），认为需要以伪满标准为技术定额的标准，只要超过这种定额即应给予超额奖励（或超额工资）；另一种则认为：技术定额必须提高到最高新纪录的标准。按照这两种说法来规定技术定额，都是错误的。我们需要的定额是介乎先进生产者所达到的新纪录和现在自然存在的技术标准之间，而为一般职工在正常的积极工作条件下都能达到的标准。
    （六）为了更好地完成定额工作，各厂矿在创造新纪录运动中，应迅速建立系统周密的统计、登记工作；并逐步进行技术标定。
    （七）各厂矿主要定额必须在十二月下旬完成并报部请批。从明年起，创造生产新纪录运动将与超额奖励结合进行。
    （八）已经实行计件工资的厂矿，因此过去有些技术定额不合理，由于在创造新纪录运动中劳动态度或技术和操作方法的改进，一般都大量地超过了。现在应即按照第二、三条规定调整工资，及时会同中共党的支部、工会研究，按照第五条规定改变其定额，并按照第二条规定调整与该项工作有关的计时工人的工资。
