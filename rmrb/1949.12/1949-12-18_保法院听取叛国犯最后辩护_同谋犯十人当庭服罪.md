Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: TASS, Sofia—The Bulgarian Supreme Court continued the trial of Bulgarian traitor Kostov and his accomplices on the 13th, hearing the defense lawyers' arguments and the defendants' final statements. Kostov's defense lawyer, Qium Iyev; Stefanov's defense lawyer, Rusiyev; Piflov's defense lawyer, Stopanov; and the defense lawyers of the other defendants all emphasized in their speeches the difficulty of defending those who had committed such grave crimes against their country and people. All defense lawyers requested the court to be lenient with the defendants.

Chief Justice Boris Lochanov said: During the seven-day trial, the court heard the defenses of the defendants, questioned witnesses, and allowed the prosecutors and defense lawyers to speak. The situation of the case is now completely clear.

Before adjourning to deliberate, the court, in accordance with the law, gave the defendants the opportunity to make a final statement.

Defendant Boyar Chaliyev said in his final statement: "I have committed crimes that endanger the Bulgarian people. I plead guilty and ask for a chance to reform myself, if possible."

Defendant Antanasov Ivanovski said: "I have told the court everything, and I recognize the seriousness of my crime." The defendant pleaded for leniency from the court.

Defendant Hadji-Panzov made his final statement, saying: "Citizens, judges, I plead guilty. I deeply and sincerely regret it." He pleaded for leniency from the court.

Defendant Tuzhev said in his final statement: "Citizens, judges, I confessed my crime during the preliminary investigation. My statement is absolutely sincere."

Defendant Dzhevrenov said: "I committed the crime of participating in a conspiracy, I plead guilty. I sincerely regret it." He pleaded for leniency.

Defendant Zhongchev said in his final statement: "In my written confession during the preliminary investigation and my oral confession in court, I have admitted my crime. I fully realize that I have committed crimes that endanger the country, the people, and the Party. I know that I must be convicted." He pleaded for leniency from the court.

Defendant Kristov made his final statement, saying: "I plead guilty. I deeply regret and sincerely repent the crimes I have committed. I implore the honorable court for leniency."

Defendant Nachev Petkov said in his final statement: "I not only plead guilty but also know my crime." He pleaded for leniency from the court.

Then, defendant Pavlov was allowed to make his final statement. He said: "As I said at the beginning of the court hearing, I plead guilty. I admit my crimes and charges. The main reason why I committed these crimes was my relationship and acquaintance with Kostov. I implore the honorable court to be lenient. I beg for a chance to atone for my sins."

The Chief Justice then allowed defendant Kostov to speak. The statements of other defendants and the testimony of witnesses all show that Kostov is guilty of maintaining contact with the Bulgarian royal police, conspiring against the state, and maintaining criminal contact with British and American intelligence agencies and the Tito fascist clique. But Kostov hypocritically and cowardly tried to escape punishment. In his final statement, he attempted to adhere to the cunning and cowardly approach he had tried to follow from the first day of the trial.

Defendant Stefanov said in his final statement: "I have committed one of the most serious crimes that greatly damages the vital interests of the Bulgarian people and the Bulgarian state. All the crimes I have committed—participating in conspiracies, espionage, and sabotage—were also committed by Kostov." He also said: "The main organizer and leader of the treasonous conspiracy, and the one who brought us to the dock, Kostov, does not have the courage to tell the truth about the crimes he and we committed in court, which shocked me greatly. Citizens, judges, and jurors! I deeply regret the crimes I have committed. I am willing to accept the verdict of the Supreme Court of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, considering it a just punishment for all the crimes I have committed."

The judge announced the court's adjournment, and the verdict is expected to be announced on December 14th.

　　保法院听取叛国犯最后辩护
  　同谋犯十人当庭服罪
    【新华社北京十六日电】塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚最高法院于十三日继续审讯保加利亚叛国犯科斯托夫及其同谋犯案，听取被告辩护律师的辩护及被告的最后辩护。科斯托夫的辩护律师究姆·伊耶夫，斯捷法诺夫的辩护律师鲁西耶夫，匹夫洛夫的辩护律师斯托潘诺夫及其他被告听辩护律师，在他们的发言中，都着重指出替那些对他们的国家与人民犯了这么深重罪孽的人进行辩护的困难。所有的辩护律师都请求法院对被告从宽处分。
    首席推事鲍里斯·洛查诺夫说：在七天审讯过程中，法院听取了各被告的辩护，讯问了证人并让起诉人和被告辩护律师发言，现在案件的情况已经完全明白。
    在退庭磋商以前，法庭依法给被告以最后申辩的机会。
    被告波雅尔查利耶夫在最后申辩时说：“我已经犯了危害保加利亚人民的罪。我服罪，并请求给我以自新的机会，如果可能的话。”
    被告安塔纳索夫·伊凡诺夫斯基说：“我已向法院把一切都讲出来了，我认识我犯罪的严重性。”被告恳请法院从宽处分。
    被告哈德伊——潘佐夫作最后申辩，他说：“公民们，法官们，我服罪。我深深地真心地悔恨。”他恳请法院从宽处分。
    被告吐捷夫在最后申辩时说：“公民们，法官们，在预备侦讯时，我就承认我的罪。我的口供是绝对真诚的。”
    被告杰夫列诺夫说：“我犯了参加共谋的罪，我服罪。我真心反悔。”他恳请从宽处分。
    被告钟切夫在最后申辩时说：“在我的预备侦讯时的书面供词及法庭上的口头供词中，我都承认了我的罪。我充分认识到我犯了危害国家、人民及党的罪。我知道必须判我的罪。”他恳请从宽处分。
    被告克里斯托夫发言作最后申辩：他说：“我服罪。我深深地后悔，真心地悔恨我所犯的罪。我恳请可尊敬的法院从宽处分。”
    被告纳切夫·彼特科夫在最后申辩时说：“我不仅服罪而且知道我的罪。”他恳请法院从宽处分。
    继而准许被告巴夫洛夫发言作最后申辩。他说：“正如我在法院侦讯开始时所说的一样，我服罪。我承认我的罪行和罪状。我所以犯这些罪，主要是由于我与科斯托夫有关系和相识。我恳请可敬的法院宽大处理。我乞求给我赎罪的机会。”
    首席推事继而允准被告科斯托夫发言。其他被告的口供和证人的证言，都说明科斯托夫犯有与保加利亚保皇警察保持联系、阴谋反对国家、与英美谍报机关及铁托法西斯集团保持犯罪联系等罪。但科斯托夫伪善地怯懦地力图逃避惩罚。在最后申辩时，他企图固守他从审判的第一天起就力图遵循的狡猾而怯懦的方针。
    被告斯捷法诺夫在最后申辩时说：“我犯了大大损害保加利亚人民与保加利亚国家切身利益的最严重的罪行之一。我犯的一切罪行——参加阴谋、间谍活动及怠工活动——也是科斯托夫所犯的。”他又说：“叛国阴谋的主要组织者与首领，并使我们到了被告席上的科斯托夫，没有勇气在法庭上把他和我们所犯的罪的真相讲出来，这使我极为震惊。公民们、法官们和陪审官们！我深深地悔恨我所犯的罪。我愿接受保加利亚人民共和国最高法院的判决，认为这是对我犯的一切罪行的公正征罚。”
    法官宣告闭庭，判决可望于十二月十四日宣布。
