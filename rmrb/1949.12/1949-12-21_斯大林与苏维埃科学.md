　　Stalin and Soviet Science
　　Chairman of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, C. N. Vavilov, translated by Zhang Ruiting
　　The great October Socialist Revolution realized Lenin and Stalin's program on the national question, laying the foundation for this friendship. The world has already confirmed that socialism means the complete elimination of national oppression. Since the existence of nations, the national question has been resolved for the first time under socialism. The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state's national policy, implemented under the firm and wise leadership of the great Stalin, revived the oppressed nations of the former Tsarist Russia, prospered their economies and cultures, transformed them into progressive socialist nations, and achieved true equality among all nations. It established mutual trust, closeness, and solid friendship among all nations.
　　Stalin was the genius creator of this friendship. In 1929, he wrote about the new socialist nations: "The working class and its internationalist party are the forces that consolidate these new nations and lead them."
　　The friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly consolidated. Stalin, in 1935, spoke of this friendship: "...The friendship between the nationalities of the Soviet Union is a great and serious achievement. Because, as long as this friendship exists, the nationalities of our country will be free and invincible. As long as this friendship exists and flourishes, we fear no one, whether domestic or foreign enemies."
　　The solid friendship between the Soviet nationalities was brilliantly confirmed in the Great Patriotic War. Soldiers from Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and Armenia, sons of all Soviet nations, bravely fought shoulder to shoulder with the heroic soldiers of the great Russian nation. They demonstrated heroism, mutual trust, and boundless love for the great socialist motherland, the Soviet government, and the invincible Lenin-Stalin Party.
　　Far behind the fascist bandits, in the forests of Belarus, in the Leningrad and Kalinin regions, on the steppes of Kuban, Don, and Ukraine, Georgians, Latvians, Uzbeks, Tatars, Dagestanis, Turkmen, Lithuanians, and Belarusian, Russians, and Ukrainians partisans fought shoulder to shoulder bravely, as brothers. During the severe trials, the strong friendship of the Soviet nationalities was consolidated with the noble blood of its sons - the soldiers. This friendship shows that it is the guarantee of the strength and invincibility of the socialist state.
　　"The friendship between the nationalities of our country," Comrade Stalin said, "has undergone all the difficulties and trials of the war, and it has been tempered once again in the general struggle of all Soviet people against the fascist bandits. This is the source of the strength of the Soviet Union."
　　The power and nobility of the friendship between nationalities were not only proven on the battlefields against shameless world fascism, but also by the daily practice of peaceful socialist construction. Mutual assistance has become the law in the close-knit family of Soviet republics. In the Soviet state, in the socialist state, there is no competition; all it has is the socialist competition of laborers, which is based on the creative initiative of laborers and its purpose is to seek the general happiness of the socialist state. The unprecedented war in the world inflicted huge losses and destruction on the Soviet state. However, due to the strength of the socialist system, due to the heroism and selflessness of the Soviet nationalities, and due to their unity around the heroic Communist Party and the genius leader and teacher Stalin, the Soviet Union's serious wounds have been healed. In a very short time, not only were the factories, workshops, and agriculture destroyed by the fascist occupiers restored, but also a huge socialist industry was built and is being built. The Soviet economy has far exceeded the pre-war level. The Soviet Union today is powerful and its economic power is unprecedented, and this power is growing day by day. This is the power of the socialist system that unites all nationalities into one.
　　The common interests of the Soviet nationalities are an endless source of vigorous Soviet patriotism.
　　"The strength of Soviet patriotism," Stalin said in 1944, "lies in the fact that its foundation is not racial prejudice, nor national prejudice; but the deep loyalty of all nationalities to their Soviet motherland, and the brotherly friendship of all the working people of our country."
　　"Soviet patriotism is not separation," Stalin further pointed out, "on the contrary, it is uniting all our nationalities and peoples into a unified and close-knit family. This should be seen as the foundation of the unbreakable and increasingly consolidated friendship between the nationalities of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet people also respect the rights and independence of foreign nationalities, and are forever willing to live in peace and friendship with neighboring countries. This should be seen as the foundation of the growing and consolidating ties between our country and all freedom-loving nations."
　　The foreign enemies of the Soviet Union, past and present, deeply know the great power and overall significance of the friendship between nationalities. Precisely for this reason, they have tried their best to attack it. They have used every possible means to spread hostility among the Soviet nationalities. Hitler did this at the time. When preparing for the armed invasion of the Soviet Union, he created and cultivated a cadre of counter-revolutionary nationalists from Ukraine and Belarus. After temporarily seizing Ukraine and Belarus, he used these greedy lackeys of fascism to achieve his goals, attempting to rely on their help to divide the great friendship between the Soviet nationalities. However, the whole world knows how the Soviet people dealt with these fascist dogs, and how the loyal sons of the motherland, the patriots of Belarus and Ukraine, cleaned them up. Only a few fascist lackeys escaped the people's revenge. These traitors and betrayers of the Belarusian and Ukrainian nationalities found refuge in the German and Anglo-American occupied zones; birds of a feather flock together, this is the law of nature. These miserable rebels colluded with the Anglo-American reactionaries and are now hiding in some Anglo-American shelters.
　　The events of recent years irrefutably point to the powerful vitality of Stalin's strategy. Today, the friendship between the Soviet nationalities has far surpassed the borders of the Soviet Union. The friendship between nationalities is the model of friendship that has been formed in the mutual relations of the People's Democratic countries and their relations with the Soviet Union. The friendship between the nationalities of the Soviet Union teaches the people of all countries. It teaches them to value the great principles of proletarian internationalism; to firmly uphold the banner of national independence; to resist the Anglo-American war instigators, who, under the guise of cosmopolitanism, are undermining the sovereignty of all nations.
　　The friendship between nationalities has become the banner of the struggle for peace, for the victory of Lenin-Stalin truth throughout the world. Humanity has been and is now advancing along the road of progress and freedom, finally defeating the robbers who build their happiness on the oppression and poverty of the masses. The very existence of the powerful multinational socialist state, the Soviet Union, has greatly accelerated the process of liberation of the oppressed masses of humanity from the shackles of capitalism. Today, it can be said with full confidence that no matter how furious the instigators of new wars are, no matter how they obstruct the path to this victory, victory will ultimately be on the side of the forces of peace, socialism, and democracy. The great ideas of Lenin and Stalin will be victorious throughout the world.
　　Today, the scholars of the Soviet state, together with all the Soviet people and all progressive people in the world, wholeheartedly celebrate the seventieth birthday of the great leader and teacher Stalin.
　　For scientific workers, as for all laborers, Comrade Stalin is first and foremost the great revolutionary and statesman, the loyal student of the great Lenin, who received the banner of the victory of the October Revolution from Lenin, and with his strong hand led all the Soviet people towards communism with this banner. With this banner, the banner of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people realized a socialist society for the first time in the world. Under Stalin's leadership and direction, our motherland has transformed from a backward agricultural country into a first-class industrialized socialist power, with a comprehensively developed industry, rational agriculture, and a grand transportation system. The Soviet army, headed by Marshal Stalin and in accordance with his strategic plan, crushed fascism during the years of the Patriotic War.
　　Soviet scholars pay deep respects to Stalin, the genius of the revolutionary country, and they clearly understand that Stalin is the pride of Soviet science, an exceptionally powerful scholar, and one of the greatest representatives of the science of the development of human society.
　　Lenin and Stalin embodied the archetype of a completely new type of scholar, in whom grand revolutionary practical activity is inextricably linked with the broadest scope of scientific thought. The unprecedented revolutionary transformation from capitalism to socialism, by its very nature, necessarily produces such a unity of revolutionary practice and social theory in the cause of the leader of the greatest revolution. "Marxism-Leninism is strong and vibrant precisely because it relies on advanced theory that correctly reflects the needs of the development of society's material life, raises this theory to its proper height, and strives to fully utilize all the mobilizing, organizing, and transforming forces of this theory." (Stalin: "Problems of Leninism," 11th edition, p. 548)
　　Lenin and Stalin's social science is an alloy of superior hardness of theory and practice, produced on the basis of a vast amount of historical experience, and it is already a force that overcomes everything. "Theory is the synthesized experience of the workers' movement in all countries," Stalin wrote in "Problems of Leninism." "Of course, theory, if it is not linked to revolutionary practice, will become a theory without an object; similarly, practice, if it is not guided by revolutionary theory, will become blind practice. However, if theory is formed in close connection with revolutionary practice, then it can become a great force of the workers' movement; because theory, and only theory, can give the movement confidence, give it the ability to determine its direction, enable it to understand the internal connections of surrounding events; because theory, and only theory, enables practice not only to understand how and where the various classes are moving at present, but also to understand how and where these classes will move in the near future." (Stalin: "Problems of Leninism," 11th edition, p. 14)
　　Affirming the deepest organic connection between theory and practice, this runs through the speeches of our great leader and teacher, from the initial stages of his revolutionary activity to the present day, whether before the victory of the revolution or during the construction of the socialist state. The unity of his activities, as a revolutionary or as a theorist, has in many ways determined the exceptional achievements in the proletarian revolution.
　　In the works of Lenin and Stalin, the doctrines of Marx and Engels were developed and deepened. In the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, Marxism cannot be limited to propositions that were timely and correct for the era of pre-monopoly capitalism. "Marxism is science. If it does not enrich itself with the new experience of the proletarian class struggle, if it does not digest this experience from a Marxist point of view, from a Marxist method, can Marxism, as a science, survive and develop? Obviously not. Is it not obvious that Marxism must improve old formulas and enrich them, taking into account new experience, while preserving the Marxist viewpoint and its method?" (Stalin: "On the Opposition," 1921-1927 essays and lectures, p. 510)
　　The decisive and creative development of Marxism was of great significance to the success of the October Revolution. On the eve of the October Revolution, Stalin said: "It is not impossible that Russia is precisely the country that is building the road to socialism... Must abandon the outdated notion that only Europe can show us the way. There exists dogmatic Marxism and creative Marxism. I stand on the latter." (Complete Works, Vol. 3, pp. 186-187)
　　Further developing Marxism and making it concrete in light of the conditions of our motherland, Marxism is not a dogma, but a guide to action - this is the extraordinary power of Lenin and Stalin's true science. Truly progressive science is as strong as foresight. It is precisely the genius of scientific foresight that explains the entire revolutionary political activity of Lenin and Stalin. We turn over "Problems of Leninism," "A Short History of the CPSU(B)," and the volumes of Stalin's Complete Works, and everywhere we encounter this manifestation of foresight. In many cases, Comrade Stalin's works are history written in advance of us. Thus, it is clear that in the history of the Soviet Union, in the development of human society, this development is not carried out blindly, but is consciously guided on the basis of science.
　　The doctrines on imperialism and the general crisis of capitalism, the doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the doctrine of the possibility of building socialism in one country, the doctrine of the socialist multi-ethnic state, the doctrine of the relationship between the proletariat and the peasantry, the doctrine of national industrialization, the doctrine of agricultural collectivization - these should be called the most important parts of Lenin and Stalin's social science. This science has become the standard for the economic foundation, social structure, and relations with surrounding countries of our country.
　　This science reveals the contradictions of capitalism, which have led capitalism to the life-and-death stage of imperialism and proletarian revolution.
　　Inheriting and developing Lenin's doctrine, Stalin developed with exceptional completeness the doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialist construction under the conditions of the victorious revolution and the encirclement of imperialism. Stalin found and implemented the solution to the basic socio-economic tasks of the special stage of the coexistence of the two systems.
　　The most important feature of Stalin's doctrine on the development of the Soviet Union on the road towards communism is its constant emphasis on the world significance of the October Proletarian Revolution. Stalin had already foreseen the huge scale of the revolutionary movement in the East and West in 1927. In Western Europe, the events unfolding before our eyes with worldwide significance - the victory of the cause of people's democracy in a series of countries - truly prove the correctness of Stalin's prediction.
　　In 1927, Stalin instructed that "The October Revolution opened up a new era, that is, the era of the alliance of the oppressed peoples and the proletariat of all countries to carry out colonial revolution under the leadership of the proletariat." (Complete Works, Vol. 10, p. 243) Observing the revolutionary movement in China and its continuous stages, Stalin decisively pointed out the third stage, the Soviet revolution, "which does not yet exist, but will appear" (Complete Works, Vol. 10, p. 14). Now the victory of the people's democratic forces in China completely confirms Stalin's prediction.
　　The most prominent feature of Lenin and Stalin's scientific theories is their infallibility, the realization of the conclusions of these theories in the course of historical events. One of the fundamental reasons for this infallibility lies in the immovable foundation of Lenin and Stalin's science. This foundation is dialectical materialism. Lenin and Stalin were the great inheritors of the philosophical doctrines of Marx and Engels, militant materialists who defended materialism and transformed it into a powerful offensive weapon for the liberation of society and human thought.
　　Stalin, the great leader who leads the people towards communism, the genius teacher and scholar, his entire life is permeated with dialectics, the invincible Marxist dialectical method for solving any difficulty. Stalin's scientific creation is a remarkable example of the application of Marxist dialectics.
　　Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's dialectical materialism has combativeness and deep optimism. This philosophy brings confidence to the victory of progressive humanity in building communism, this philosophy injects confidence in the possibility of fully understanding nature and making it subject to the needs of man. The philosophy of dialectical materialism, under the conditions of the socialist state, becomes the worldview of the masses of the people. But the dialectical worldview does not become a dogma here, it does not freeze into a completed and solidified scientific system. Dialectical materialism, according to its own dynamic basic essence, is in a state of eternal development and change, only retaining its basic principles of materialism and dialectical characteristics. The fact that the dialectical worldview is most widely consolidated among the masses in our motherland should be attributed to Stalin.
　　The profound materialist understanding of the role of science by the revolutionary leaders Lenin and Stalin, understanding it as a tool for human progress and happiness, has determined the destiny of the science of the motherland in the Soviet state after October in a completely new way. Science has been recognized by the new socialist state as the most important national cause of the people. Under the new conditions, the science of the motherland has rapidly transformed from the superficial superstructure of Tsarist Russia into the most important part of the foundation on which the victorious revolution began to build a new socialist society. Science has changed in its basic characteristics, in its purpose, in its content, and in its scale.
　　The characteristics of Soviet science were explained by Stalin in his speech at the reception for workers in higher education on May 17, 1938, in the Kremlin. At that time, he defined this science as a science that serves the people with spontaneous enthusiasm, a science that opens its doors to the new forces of the country. In the Stalin era, the science of our motherland has become the science of the people due to a series of reasons, first of all, it has a direction that serves the people without any discount, secondly, the people - workers and collective farmers - enter science in a magnificent torrent, that is, entering scientific research institutes, universities, joining the technical leaders of factories, etc. Soviet science is the science of the people, also because its extremely important and broad achievements are disseminated among the people by all possible means. Through popular books with huge print numbers, through radio, through thousands upon thousands of lectures made in every corner of the country, in cities and in villages, science becomes the property of all the Soviet people.
　　Before the October Revolution, only 20% of the children and teenagers of the appropriate age were studying in primary and secondary schools in Russia. In the Stalin era, since 1933, primary education in the Soviet state has become universal and compulsory. The Party and the government are striving to make secondary education also universal, and to make higher education as accessible as possible. The Soviet intelligentsia has greatly increased, and its composition has fundamentally changed compared to before the revolution. Comrade Stalin pointed out this in the 18th Party Congress, saying: "Hundreds of thousands of young people, from the working class, peasants, and working intellectuals, have entered universities and secondary vocational schools, and after graduating, they have supplemented the weak ranks of the intelligentsia. They inject new blood into the intelligentsia and revive it in a new way, in a Soviet way. They fundamentally changed the entire face of the intelligentsia according to their own image and likeness. The remnants of the old intelligentsia have dissolved into the new Soviet people's intelligentsia. This has created a new Soviet intelligentsia, which is closely linked to the people, and the vast majority of them are determined to serve the people with all their hearts. To sum up, we now have a large, new, people's, socialist intelligentsia, which is fundamentally different from the old bourgeois intelligentsia in terms of composition and socio-political outlook." (Stalin: "Report at the 18th Congress of the CPSU(B)")
　　The new, progressive, and people's science inevitably changed in its content. Stalin emphasized in his aforementioned speech at the Kremlin on May 17, 1938, that this science is unwilling to be a traditional slave, and bravely breaks traditions, norms, and markers, if they become old. Soviet science has made a decisive break with the old traditions in many of its departments. All sciences concerning society - history, economics, law, etc. - have been transformed in a new way. Physics, chemistry, and geology have become assistants to technology. Michurin's science and its new views on evolution and directed change, and its practical conclusions in the field of agriculture, have triumphed in the field of life sciences. The new Stalin's science that serves the motherland enables the completion of Lenin's instruction on the electrification of the country; it provides the theoretical basis for the construction of huge hydraulic projects and the Moscow subway; it enables our scholars and engineers to master atomic energy in a very short period of time.
　　Soviet science is the science of the Party. It corresponds to the ideology of the vanguard of the progressive class - the working class - that is guiding humanity towards a wonderful future. This partisanship of our science determines its program and its direction in many situations. The distinct peculiarity of our entire science lies in its clearly expressed materialistic basis and practical direction. To fight against idealistic tendencies that want to drag science off the right track - this is the essential characteristic of all departments of Soviet science. In the science of capitalist countries, it is precisely in recent years that the idealistic tendencies have strengthened. Soviet science opposes the science of capitalist countries and forms an unshakable bulwark of materialism. Another characteristic of our science is its constantly growing connection with practice. The question of consolidating the achievements of scientific research into life is a more fundamental question for Soviet scholars year by year. The state raises this question to scholars of any specialty, raising such questions to mathematicians and physicists, and similarly to writers and philosophers. The era of so-called pure science is gone forever in the Soviet state.
　　Closely related to the increased national significance of science is the flourishing growth of science in the Stalin era. Before the October Revolution, there were approximately three thousand people in Russia participating in higher education and research institutions. Among them, there were barely one thousand who were precisely engaged in scientific research. And now, there are 100,000 experts in the Soviet Union engaged in scientific research work. In other words, in our country, the number of scholars and researchers has increased approximately one hundredfold in thirty-two years. Due to such a huge increase, the small group of scholars before the revolution has now become a large army of science, this increase especially clearly shows what kind of encounters science has in the Soviet state. The large army of science itself needs thousands of large and well-equipped research institutes. Such research institutes have been established in the Soviet state under the instructions of the Party and the government, and under the special attention of Lenin and Stalin. A typical example of the increase in scientific institutions in the Soviet era, which has never been seen in any country in the world, can be said to be the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The Academy of Sciences has existed in Russia since the beginning of the eighteenth century. Before the October Revolution, its system included five small laboratories, the Pulkovo Observatory, the main physical observatory, and a considerable number of various museums and archives. And in the thirty-two years of the Soviet era, the Academy of Sciences has increased in an unprecedented way - it has become a huge association of scientific research institutions. There is no such Academy of Sciences anywhere in the world. In 1949, the Soviet Academy of Sciences had a total of: fifty-seven institutes, fifteen laboratories, four observatories, seven museums, thirty-three scientific stations, and ten scientific societies, distributed in Moscow, Leningrad, Crimea, and other parts of the Soviet Union. In addition to the central scientific institutions, the Academy of Sciences also has sixteen branches spread throughout the Soviet Union, from Sakhalin Island to Kishinev and Petrozavodsk. The Soviet Academy of Sciences has transformed from a scientific institution with aristocratic privileges and little connection to the economic and cultural development of the motherland into an important national institution with a direction that fully satisfies the requirements of industry, agriculture, and culture. Parallel to the Soviet Academy of Sciences, independent academies of sciences have emerged in the ten republics that joined the Soviet Union. Several of these have now become huge and important scientific centers. Relying on the government and the Party, and the exceptional attention of Lenin and Stalin personally to the development of the science of the motherland (which is needed for the socialist state to move towards communism), such an astonishing growth and development of the Academy of Sciences has become possible.
　　The astonishing prosperity of Soviet science, its growing achievements, and the emotions of patriotism and national pride, raise the question of the position and significance of Soviet science in the Soviet motherland in a new way. In the pre-revolutionary era, the Tsarist regime and the intelligentsia themselves saw the surrounding backward technology and held a skeptical attitude towards the science of the motherland. They cultivated the worship of foreign science. Even the greatest discoveries of their own scholars were not seen in their eyes, and the entire country was considered a scientific backwater. Times have changed. The leap in the quantity and quality of our science and technology in the Stalin era shows our true strength to us and to the world. Having reached the current height of science, we can now look to the future and, on the other hand, look back at the past. The results of historical investigation in the Soviet era have successfully determined that there have been many outstanding achievements and discoveries in the past in our motherland in all fields of knowledge. The right to invent a series of the most important technical discoveries belongs to our country. However, the genius of the people displayed in the achievements of individual famous scholars and engineers in the Tsarist era was merely "a voice in the wilderness" (meaning a reform request that no one would heed and that would not be tolerated - from Matthew 3:3), and only now, in the Soviet state, can we assess our past in the field of science according to its value.
　　This past, as well as our great achievements in recent decades, gave our leader and teacher Stalin the basis to express his confidence on February 9, 1946, that in the near future Soviet scholars will surpass the achievements of foreign science. The unprecedented rise and prosperity of our science in recent years (which the whole world has seen), realized under Stalin's direction and leadership, and encouraged by him, leaves us no doubt that Comrade Stalin's instructions will be completed by Soviet scholars.
　　Together with all the working people and all progressive humanity in the world, Soviet scholars warmly celebrate Stalin and wish the great leader and teacher health and strength.

　　斯大林与苏维埃科学
    苏联科学院主席  Ｃ·Ｎ·华维洛夫  张瑞亭译
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，实现了列宁——斯大林关于民族问题的纲领，奠定了这个友谊的基础。全世界已经确信，社会主义意味着民族压迫的完全消除。自有民族以来，民族问题首次在社会主义下获得了解决。在伟大的斯大林的坚定而英明的领导下以实现的布尔什维克党与苏维埃国家底民族政策，使以前帝俄时代的被压迫民族复活起来，使经济文化繁荣起来，使他们变成进步的社会主义民族；达到了各民族的真正平权。确立了各民族间的相互信任、亲密和坚固的友谊。
    斯大林是这种友谊底天才的创造者，一九二九年他论到新的社会主义民族时曾写道：“工人阶级及其国际主义的政党是巩固这些新的民族并领导他们的力量。”
    苏联各民族间的友谊日见巩固。斯大林在一九三五年论及这个友谊时曾说：“……苏联各民族间的友谊是一件巨大的和严重的成就。因为，只要这种友谊存在一天，我国各民族将是自由的和不可战胜的。只要这种友谊存在和昌盛一天，我们谁都不怕的，不论是国内的或是国外的敌人。”
    苏维埃各民族间的牢固友谊，在伟大的卫国战争中得到了光辉的证实。乌克兰、白俄罗斯、乌兹贝克、卡萨赫、土克曼、乔治亚、亚美尼亚各族人民的战士，一切苏维埃民族的儿子，和伟大的俄罗斯民族底英勇的战士在一起勇敢地并肩作战。他们表现了英雄气概与相互信任，以及对伟大的社会主义祖国，对苏维埃政府和不可战胜的列宁——斯大林党的无限热爱。
    在法西斯强盗很远的后方，在白俄罗斯的森林里，在列宁格拉和加里宁州，在库班、顿河、乌克兰的草原上，乔治亚人、拉脱维亚人、乌兹贝克人、鞑靼人、达吉克人、土克曼人、立陶宛人，与白俄罗斯人、俄罗斯人及乌克兰人的游击队一起，如亲兄弟一般勇敢地并肩作战。在严重的考验期间，苏联各民族的强大友谊是用其儿子——战士——高贵的血巩固起来的。这友谊表明，它就是社会主义国家强盛和不可战胜的保证。
    “我国各民族间的友谊——斯大林同志说——经历了战争的一切困难和考验，它在所有苏维埃人们反法西斯强盗的一般斗争中，它又受了一次锻炼。这就是苏联力量的源泉。”
    各民族间友谊底力量和高贵，不但在反抗无耻的世界法西斯的战场上证明了，它们还由和平的社会主义建设之日常实践所证明了。相互帮助成了苏维埃共和国亲睦大家庭中的法律。在苏维埃国家里，在社会主义国家里，是没有竞争的；她所有的是劳动者底社会主义竞赛，这种竞赛是以劳动者创造性的主动精神为基础的，它的目的在于求得社会主义国家的一般幸福。世界上空前未有的战争，使苏维埃国家蒙受了巨大的损失与破坏，然而由于社会主义制度的强大；由于苏维埃各民族的英雄气概和忘我精神；由于他们团结在英雄的共产党和天才的领袖与导师斯大林的周围，苏联的严重创伤已经痊愈了。在极短的时间内，不但恢复了被法西斯占领者所破坏了的工场、作坊与农业，而且建设了并在建设着巨大的社会主义工业。苏维埃经济已远超过了战前的水准。苏联在今天是强大的和经济上的威力是空前的，而且这个威力还在逐日增长着。这就是团结各民族为一体的社会主义制度底力量。
    苏维埃各民族间的共同利益是有活力的苏维埃爱国主义底无尽源泉。
    “苏维埃爱国主义的力量，——斯大林在一九四四年曾说，——就在于它的基础不是种族的偏见，也不是民族的偏见；而是各民族对自己苏维埃祖国的深厚的忠诚，以及我国一切民族劳动者底兄弟般友谊。”
    “苏维埃爱国主义不是分离——斯大林进一步指明，——恰恰相反，而是团结我国所有民族和人民而成为一个统一的亲睦的大家庭。应当把这看作苏联各民族间不能破坏和日趋巩固的友谊底基础。同时苏联各族人民也尊重国外各民族的权利与独立，并永远愿与邻国和平和友好相处。应当把这看作我国和爱好自由的各民族生长与巩固中的联系底基础。”
    苏联的国外敌人，过去和现在都深切地知道各民族间友谊底强大力量和整个意义。正因为如此，他们尽力打击它。他们用一切可能的方法，在苏联各民族间传播着敌意。希特勒在当时就是这样做的。他在准备武装进攻苏联时，曾造就和培养了乌克兰和白俄罗斯的反革命的民族主义者干部。在暂时夺到乌克兰和白俄罗斯之后，他为了达到自己的目的，便使用法西斯主义底这些贪婪的奴才，企图依靠他们的帮助来分裂苏联各民族间的伟大友谊。但是，全世界都知道：苏维埃人民是如何对付这些法西斯走狗的，祖国忠实的儿子——白俄罗斯与乌克兰的爱国者——是如何收拾了他们的。只有少数法西斯奴才逃过了人民的报复。白俄罗斯及乌克兰民族的这些卖国贼和叛徒们，在德国英美占领区找到了避难所；物以类聚，这是自然底法则。这些可怜的反叛者和英美反动派同流合污，现在正躲在英美的一些庇寒所里。
    最近数年的事件，不容反驳地指明了斯大林策略的强大的活力，今天，苏维埃民族间的友谊，已远远地越出了苏联的境界。各民族间的友谊是现今人民民主国家相互关系以及她们和苏联的关系上所形成的那个友谊底范本。苏联各民族间的友谊教导了一切国家的人民。它教导她们要重视无产阶级国际主义底伟大原则；要坚决地保持民族独立的旗帜；要抗击英美战争挑拨者，这批挑拨者在以世界主义思想作掩饰下来破坏各民族的主权。
    各民族间的友谊，成为争取和平、争取全世界列宁——斯大林真理胜利的旗帜。人类曾经而且现在也是沿着进步与自由底道路前进，最后战胜那把自己的幸福建筑在人民大众底压迫和贫困上的强盗们。强大的多民族的社会主义国家——苏联——的存在事实本身，大大加速了人类被压迫群众从资本主义桎梏下解放的过程。今天可以充满信心地说：不论新战争的挑拨者如何狂怒，不论他们在走向这个胜利的途中如何阻挠，胜利终是在和平、社会主义和民主力量这方面的。列宁—斯大林的伟大思想，将要在全世界获得胜利的。
    今天，苏维埃国家的学者们，同苏维埃全体人民和全世界所有进步人士，一致热诚地庆贺伟大领袖及导师斯大林的七十诞辰。
    对于科学工作者，如对一切劳动者一样，斯大林同志首先是伟大的革命者和政治家，是伟大列宁底忠诚的学生，他从列宁那里接到十月革命胜利的旗帜，并以其坚强的手带着这个旗帜，领导全体苏维埃人民走向共产主义。同着这个旗帜，列宁、斯大林的旗帜，苏维埃人民第一次在世界上实现了社会主义社会。在斯大林底领导和指示下，我们祖国，从一个落后的农业国，变成头等工业化的社会主义强国，具有全面发达的工业、合理的农业、宏大的运输。苏维埃军队，以斯大林大元帅为首，并依照他的战略计划，在卫国战争的几年里面，粉碎了法西斯主义。
    苏维埃学者们向革命的国家的天才斯大林深致敬礼，他们并十分清楚地了解：斯大林——就是苏维埃科学的骄傲，是异常有力的学者，是人类社会发展的科学之最伟大代表者之一。
    列宁和斯大林体现了完全新型学者的典型，在这种新型学者身上，宏大的革命实践积极性同科学思想底最广规模不可分地结合着。从资本主义到社会主义前所未见的革命转变，由其特殊性便必然产生最伟大革命底领袖底事业中的革命实践与社会理论这样的统一。“马列主义之所以强而有力和生气勃勃——斯大林说，——就是因为它凭借于正确反映着社会物质生活发展需要的先进理论，把这个理论提到它应有的高度，并努力来彻底利用这个理论所有的动员的，组织的和改造的力量。”（斯大林：“列宁主义问题”，十一版，五四八页）
    列宁和斯大林底社会科学——就是理论和实践的超等硬度的合金，它产生于巨量历史经验底基础上，已是战胜一切的动力。“理论是世界各国工人运动底综合经验。——斯大林在“列宁主义问题”里写道，——当然，理论若不和革命实践联系起来，就会变成无对象的理论，同样，实践若不以革命理论为指南，就会变成盲目的实践。可是，理论如果是在和革命实践密切联系中形成的，那它就能成为工人运动底伟大力量；因为，理论，而且只有理论，才能使运动具有信心，使它有确定方针的能力，使它能了解四周事变底内在联系；因为，理论，而且只有理论，才使实践不仅能了解各阶级在目前如何行进和向那里行进，而且能了解这些阶级在最近将来会如何行进和向那里行进。”（斯大林：“列宁主义问题”，十一版，一四页）
    肯定理论和实践的最深刻的有机联系，这，不论是在革命胜利以前，或是在社会主义国家建设时，都贯穿在我们伟大领袖及导师的言论中，自其革命活动的初步，以迄于今日。他底活动的统一性，作为革命者，或作为理论家，在许多方面都决定了无产阶级革命中的异常的成就。
    在列宁和斯大林底著作中，马克思和恩格斯的学说被发展并深刻化。在帝国主义及无产阶级革命时代，马克思主义不能被对垄断前资本主义时代是适时的正确的命题所限制。“马克思主义——就是科学。若其不以无产阶级阶级斗争的新经验来丰富自己，若其不以马克思主义观点、在马克思主义方法的角度下来消化这些经验，那么作为科学的马克思主义能不能留存和发展呢？显然，是不能的。马克思主义，须要在照顾新的经验的基础上，在保存马克思主义观点及其方法的情形下，改进旧的公式并丰富它们，这不是很明显吗？”（斯大林：“论反对派”，一九二一——二七论文与讲演，五一○页）
    马克思主义之断然的创造性的发展，对于十月革命的成功有伟大的意义。十月革命的前夕，斯大林说过：“辟筑走向社会主义道路的国家恰恰就是俄国，这，不是没有可能的……。必须摒弃已经过时的观念，说只有欧洲能指给我们道路。存在着教条的马克思主义与创造性的马克思主义。我站在后者的基础上。”（全集，卷三，一八六—一八七页）
    针对我们祖国的条件进一步发展马克思主义，并使之具体化，马克思主义不是教条，而是行动的指导，——这就是列宁、斯大林底真实科学之异乎寻常的力量所在。真正进步的科学常和预见一样强。恰是科学的预见天才说明着列宁、斯大林底全部革命的政治活动。我们翻阅“列宁主义问题”，“联共（布）历史简要读本”、斯大林全集诸卷，到处遇到这种预见底表现。在许多场合下，斯大林同志的著作在我们之前尤之乎预先写定的历史。这样便明白了：在苏联底历史里，在人类社会底发展里，这次发展不是盲目进行的，而是在科学的基础上被有意识地指导着。
    论帝国主义和资本主义底普遍危机的学说，无产阶级专政的学说，在一个国家内建设社会主义之可能性的学说，论社会主义多民族国家，论无产阶级和农民相互关系，论国家工业化，论农业集体化——这些应称为列宁、斯大林社会科学底最重要的部分。这个科学已成为我们国家经济基础、社会结构与同周围国家关系之标准器了。
    这个科学揭开了资本主义的矛盾，这些矛盾已把资本主义引上帝国主义的和无产阶级革命的生死交关的阶段。
    斯大林承继并发展列宁底学说，他异常完备地发展了在胜利了的革命及帝国主义围绕的条件下无产阶级专政和社会主义建设的学说。斯大林找到了并实现了对两个制度并存的特殊阶段的基本社会经济任务底解决办法。
    斯大林底关于苏联在朝向共产主义的道路上发展的学说，其最重要特点在于其不断地强调十月无产阶级革命底世界意义。斯大林还在一九二七年便预先料到革命运动在东方及西方的巨大规模。在西欧，展开在我们眼前的具有全世界重要性的事件——一系列国家中人民民主事业底胜利——确实证明斯大林预测之正确。
    一九二七年，斯大林指示说，“十月革命开辟了一个新时代，即世界各被压迫国人民与无产阶级联盟并在无产阶级领导下进行殖民地革命的时代。”（全集，卷十，二四三页）观察中国的革命运动及其连续的诸阶段，斯大林便断然地指出第三个阶段，苏维埃革命，“它现在还未曾有，但它将就出现”（全集，卷十，一四页）。现在中国人民民主势力的胜利完完全全地确实证明斯大林的预测。
    列宁和斯大林底科学理论底最显著的特点，就是它们底毫无错误，这些理论底结论在历史事件进程中的实现。这样毫无错误底基本原因之一在于列、斯科学立脚基础之不可动摇。这个基础就是辩证唯物主义。列宁和斯大林就是马克思、恩格斯哲学学说底伟大承继者，战斗的唯物主义者，他们保卫了唯物主义并将其变成争取社会及人类思想解放的有力的进攻武器。
    斯大林、领导人民走向共产主义的伟大领袖、天才的导师和学者，他的整个生命便浸透着辩证法，不可战胜的解决任何困难的马克思主义的辩证方法。斯大林底科学创造——就是马克思主义辩证法应用底显著典型。
    马、恩、列、斯底辩证唯物主义有着战斗性及深沉乐观性。这一哲学给进步人类建设共产主义的胜利，带来信心，这一哲学对完全理解自然及使它服从于人底需要之可能，注入确信。辩证唯物主义底哲学，在社会主义国家底条件下，成为人民大众底宇宙观。但辩证的宇宙观在这里不变作教条，它不冷固成为完成的凝固的科学体系。辩证唯物主义，依照自己动的基本本质，它是处在永远发展及变化的状态中，只是保留自己基本的原则的唯物主义的和辩证法的特性。辩证的宇宙观之在群众中间最广泛地巩固起来，这一点在我们祖国应归功于斯大林。
    革命领袖列宁和斯大林对科学作用的深邃的唯物主义的理解，将其理解作为人类进步及幸福的工具，这便全新地决定了十月之后在苏维埃国家里祖国科学底命运。科学被新的社会主义的国家承认为最重要的人民的国家的事情。在新的条件下，祖国科学，已从沙皇俄国作为门面上装饰的上层建筑，迅速地变成胜利了的革命在其上开始建设新的社会主义社会的基础底最重要的一部分。科学于其基本特征、于其目的、于其内容、于其规模均起了变化。
    苏维埃科学底特点被斯大林在一九三八年五月十七日在克里姆林宫招待高等学校工作者的发言中予以说明。那时他确定这个科学是带着自发的热望服务人民的，是对国家新生的力量敞开大门的科学。在斯大林时代，我们祖国科学之所以成为人民的是由于一系列的原因，这里首先是由于它具有一不折不扣为人民服务的方向，次之，是由于人民——工人与集体农民——以壮阔的巨流涌入科学，就是进入科学研究所，高等学校，加入工厂的技术领导者等。苏维埃科学之所以是人民的，还由于它底极为重要的宽广的成果以一切可能的途径传布在人民中间。凭借巨大印行数字的通俗书籍，借助无线电，借助于在国家各个角落、城市中和乡村中所作的成千成万的讲演会，科学成为全体苏维埃人民底财产。
    十月革命以前，在俄国小学、中学里读书的只是适龄儿童和少年总数的百分之二○。在斯大林时代，从一九三三年起，在苏维埃国家里初级教育已成为全面的、义务的了。党和政府正竭力使中等教育也成为全面的，并使高等学校入学尽可能地容易。苏维埃的知识界大大地繁增了，而且其成分，和革命以前比较，根本上起了变化。斯大林同志在十八次党代表大会指出这点说道：“数十万的年轻人，从工人阶级，农民和劳动知识分子中间出身的人，进了高等学校和中等实业学校，他们毕业后就补充了知识界薄弱的队伍。他们把新的血液注进知识界中去，并用新的方式，用苏维埃的方式把它复活起来。他们按照自己的形象和模样来根本改变了知识界底整个面貌。旧知识界底残余已溶解在新的苏维埃的人民的知识界中了。这样就造成了新的苏维埃的知识界，它是和人民密切联系着，其中绝大多数人都决意竭诚尽忠服务于人民。总结起来，我们现在便有人数众多的，新的，人民的，社会主义的知识界，它无论按成分或社会政治面貌来说，都是根本和旧时资产阶级知识界不同的。”（斯大林：“联共（布）十八次代表大会上的报告”）
    新的，进步的，人民的科学不可避免地在其内容上起了变化。斯大林在一九三八年五月十七日在上面曾述及的在克里姆林宫里的发言中，曾强调说，这个科学不愿作传统的奴婢，并且勇敢地打破传统、规范及标的，要是它们变为老朽的话。苏维埃科学已在自己许多部门中对老朽的传统作了断然的破除。所有关于社会的科学——历史学、经济学、法学等——都已依新的方式加以改造。物理学、化学及地质学已变成技术的帮助者。米丘林科学及其对进化和变导的新观点，及它在农业范围内的实践结论，在生命科学底领域内胜利了。为祖国服务的新的斯大林的科学使能完成列宁底国家电气化的指示；它为巨大的水力工程的建筑和莫斯科地下铁道提供了理论基础；它使我们底学者和工程师们在极短的时期内更掌握了原子能。
    苏维埃科学——是党性的科学。它符合于那引导人类走向美妙的未来的进步阶级——工人阶级——底前卫部分底思想意识。我们科学底这一党性，在许多情况中决定它底纲领与它的方向。我们整个科学底明确的特异点在于它底明白表示出来的唯物主义基础和实践的方向。同那些要把科学拖出正路的唯心主义倾向作斗争，——这就是苏维埃科学所有部门的本质的特点。在资本主义国家底科学里，恰是在最近几年之内，唯心主义的倾向加强起来，苏维埃科学与资本主义国家底科学对立，而形成了摇撼不动的唯物主义的砥柱。我们科学底另一特点，就是其与实践间不断增长的联系。关于巩固科学研究的成就到生活中去的问题，对于苏维埃学者是一年比一年更为基本的问题。国家把这个问题提到任何专长的学者之前，对于数学家和物理学家提这样的问题，对于文学家和哲学家同样提这样的问题。所谓纯粹科学的时代在苏维埃国家里是一去不返了。
    和科学底提高了的国家意义紧密相关的，则是科学在斯大林时代里蓬勃的增长。十月革命以前在俄国参与高等学校及研究机关的人，约有三千。在其中，精确地讲，与科学研究有关者差强有一千人。而现在，苏联有十万个专家从事科学研究工作。换句话说，在我们国家里，三十二年中间学者研究家的数目增加了约一百倍。由于这样巨大的增长，革命以前时的小小学者集团，现在变成了科学的大军，这个增长特别明白地表示出在苏维埃国家里科学有怎样的际遇。科学的大军自身需要成千的、大的、设备很好的研究所。这样的研究所在苏维埃国家里已按照党和政府的指示并在列宁斯大林对此特别关注之下建立起来了。全世界任何国家都未曾见到过的苏维埃年代科学机关增大底典范例子可说是苏联科学院。科学院在俄国自十八世纪之初便存在了。十月革命以前，在它的系统里有五个不大的实验室，布尔科夫天文台，主要的物理观测所及为数颇多的各种博物馆及档案。而在苏维埃的三十二年间，科学院闻所未闻地增大了——它变成科学研究机关的一个巨大的联合体了。世界上任何地方都没有这样的科学院。一九四九年中，苏联科学院共有：五十七个研究所，十五个实验室，四个观象台，七个博物馆，三十三个科学站及十个科学学会，分布在莫斯科，列宁格勒，克里米及苏联其他各地。科学院的系统中除了中央科学机关外，另一方面还有十六个分院，遍布于全苏，自库页岛以迄于基善涅夫和彼得罗萨沃茨克。苏联科学院，从一个门阀特权的与祖国经济文化少有关联的科学机关，变成了重要的国家机关，具有完全的满足工业、农业、文化要求的方向。与苏联科学院并列的，在十个加入苏联的共和国里，出现了独立的科学院。其中有几个现已成为巨大的重要的科学中心。依靠着政府和党及列宁斯大林个人对祖国科学发展（这是社会主义国家走向共产主义所需要的）问题的异常注意，科学院这样惊人的成长与发展成了可能。
    苏维埃科学惊人的昌盛，其增长着的成就，爱国主义及民族骄傲底情感，乃以新的方式提出在苏联祖国科学底地位和意义的问题。在革命前的时代，沙皇政权及知识界本身看到周围落后的技术，便对祖国科学抱怀疑的态度。培养着对外国科学的崇拜。直至自己学者底最巨大的发现也看不到眼里，整个国家被认为是科学的穷乡僻壤，时代变了。我们底科学和技术在斯大林时代量上和质上的飞跃显示出我们真正的力量给我们及全世界看。我们既达到了科学现在底高度，此刻便能够瞻望未来，并在另一方面回首过去。在苏维埃年代中对历史考察的结果，已成功地断定了在我们祖国的过去，在知识底各领域里曾有许多卓越的成就与发现。一系列最重要的技术发现底发明权是属于我们国家的。但是，显示在帝俄时代个别著名学者及工程师底成就中之人民的天才，只是“旷野的呼声”（意谓无人会、不见容于世的改革要求——事出马太福音三章二节）罢了，而只有在此时苏维埃国家里，我们方能够按其价值来估量科学领域中我们底过去。
    这个过去以及近数十年来我们伟大的成就，给我们底领袖和导师斯大林以根据，他乃在一九四六年二月九日表示确信在最近期间苏维埃学者将凌驾外国科学底成就而上之。我们科学近几年来史所未见的高涨及昌盛（这全世界都已看见），在斯大林底指示和领导下实现，并为他所鼓舞的高涨，使我们毫无疑义；斯大林同志底指示将被苏联学者所完成。
    同全体劳动者全世界所有进步人类一起，苏联学者们热烈地庆贺斯大林，并祝伟大的领袖和导师健康，强壮。
