The representative of the Ukrainian Republic, Manuilsky, rose to speak. He meticulously listed facts, pointing out that the so-called Hague Agreement was merely a transaction between Dutch imperialists and the Hatta traitorous clique to sell out the Indonesian people. Manuilsky solemnly put forward the following proposals: (1) The withdrawal of Dutch troops to the original positions before the December 1948 war should be the first action to restore normalcy to the Indonesian situation; (2) The Dutch government should immediately release Indonesian political prisoners and stop the Dutch occupation authorities' acts of terror against the Indonesian people; (3) A United Nations committee composed of members of the Security Council should be responsible for supervising the implementation of the above two resolutions and investigate the Dutch authorities' actions of torture, massacre, and persecution of Indonesian people's democratic leaders; (4) The committee should be instructed to draft and submit to the Security Council recommendations for resolving the conflict between the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia within three months (from now on), based on the principle of recognizing the independence and sovereign rights of the Indonesian people; (5) Abolish the United Nations Commission for Indonesia.

The Soviet representative, Tsarapkin, then spoke, also citing many facts to expose the essence of the Hague Agreement. He pointed out that as early as June 1948, this conspiracy had been agreed upon and reached at the Tangkilang Conference between Sukarno and Hatta on one side and the American representative of the United Nations Commission for Indonesia on the other. He further pointed out that the purpose of this transaction was to seek American aid to destroy the Indonesian national liberation movement. Shortly after this conference, the Sukarno-Hatta government immediately proceeded to abolish trade unions, shoot leaders of the People's Democratic Front, obstruct land reform, and collude with the Dutch, accepting Dutch weapons to destroy the national liberation movement of Indonesian patriots. Tsarapkin finally pointed out that the situation in Indonesia has become a threat to peace and security, and the General Assembly must discuss the Indonesian issue and pass a resolution to end Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia. However, the solution to the Indonesian issue must not be sought in transactions with the Dutch colonialists and their American patrons. The solution to the Indonesian issue must be sought in a policy of protecting the Republic of Indonesia rather than forcing its elimination, giving the Indonesian people full freedom to decide their destiny. Therefore, the Soviet delegation fully supports the Ukrainian delegation's proposal and believes that the measures proposed by the Ukrainian delegation are a legitimate way to effectively and fairly resolve the Indonesian issue.

　　乌克兰代表团提案主张
  　安理会各国应组委员会负责公平解决印尼问题
    乌克兰共和国代表曼努意斯基起立发言。他详细地列举事实，指出所谓海牙协定只是荷兰帝国主义者与哈达卖国集团出卖印尼人民的交易。曼努意斯基严正地提出了下列提案：（一）将荷兰军队撤至一九四八年十二月战争发生以前的原阵地，以作为使印尼局势恢复正常的第一个行动；（二）荷兰政府应立即释放印尼政治犯，并停止荷兰占领当局对印尼人民的恐怖行为；（三）由安理会各理事国组成联合国委员会，负责监督以上二项决议之执行，并调查荷兰当局对印尼人民民主领袖的刑讯、屠杀及迫害等行动；（四）责成该委员会在三个月内（自现在起）根据承认印尼人民的独立与主权权利的原则，起草并向安理会提出解决荷兰与印尼共和国间冲突的建议；（五）取消联合国印尼委员会。
    苏联代表查拉普金继起发言，他也引证许多事实揭穿海牙协定的实质。他指出，早在一九四八年六月，在以苏加诺和哈达为一方和以联合国印尼委员会的美国代表为另一方的塘吉浪会议上，就已协议并达成了这个阴谋。他又指出，这个交易的目的，是在求得美国的援助以摧残印尼民族解放运动。当这次会议之后不久，苏加诺——哈达政府立即就进行取消职工会，枪杀人民民主阵线的领袖，阻挠土地改革，并与荷兰狼狈为奸，接受荷兰武器，以摧残印尼爱国者的民族解放运动。查拉普金最后指出：印尼的情势已成为对和平与安全的威胁，大会必须讨论印尼问题，并通过决议，以结束荷兰在印尼的殖民地统治。但是，印尼问题的解决，决不能求之于与荷兰殖民者及其美国恩主之间的交易。印尼问题的解决，必须求之于这一方针：即采取保卫印尼共和国而不是强迫消灭印尼共和国的方式给予印尼人民以决定其命运的充分自由。因此，苏联代表团完全赞成乌克兰代表团的提案，并且认为，乌克兰代表团所提议的措施，乃是有效而公平地解决印尼问题的正当途径。
