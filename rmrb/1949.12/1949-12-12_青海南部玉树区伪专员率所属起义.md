Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, November 11th: Late-breaking news: Ma Jun, the Kuomintang government's administrative inspector and pseudo-commissioner of Yushu District in southern Qinghai, led all district employees—from Yushu, Nangqian, and Chengduo counties—in telegraphing their uprising on November 2nd, breaking away from the Kuomintang reactionary rule. On that day, over a thousand people from Yushu, including leaders of thousand-household units, hundred-household units, various institutions, and people from all walks of life, gathered to celebrate liberation. (Note: Yushu and Nangqian are key points for Qinghai entering Xikang. The entire district has a population of approximately 20,000 and serves as a trading hub for various ethnic groups in southern Qinghai, with thriving commerce. Leaders of thousand-household and hundred-household units are official positions appointed by Tusi, governing one thousand or one hundred households, respectively.)

Ma Jun's uprising telegram to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the People's Liberation Army, and Commander Peng of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army on November 2nd stated: The Kuomintang reactionaries disregard the entire nation and people, acting selfishly and engaging in dictatorial betrayal of the country, violating the interests of the people, and willingly serving as running dogs of American imperialism. You have been eliminating violence and bringing peace to the 475 million compatriots, liberating the entire country, eliminating the violence of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and expelling the forces of American imperialism from China, saving the people from deep water and scorching fire. All sectors of this district held a celebration of liberation today, and from now on, we are willing to work under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government to build a new China and a new Qinghai.
