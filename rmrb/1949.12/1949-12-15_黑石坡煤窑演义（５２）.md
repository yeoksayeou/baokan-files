　　The Black Stone Slope Coal Mine Chronicles (52)

　　It was night, and Old Yin attended the meeting of Little Foreign Devil's group. Tai Cheng indeed admitted his mistake and said that he had wholeheartedly agreed to using silver dollars to start the mine: "Anyway, with Old Yin in charge, what's there to be afraid of!" Old Yin hurriedly said, "Tai Cheng can't say that, it's the decision of the whole village!" But few people spoke below. Little Foreign Devil and Old Yin conspired for a while, then suddenly someone said: "Our group is full of idlers, there aren't many experienced miners, let's just see how the other groups do it!" Little Foreign Devil saw that the atmosphere at the meeting was better than the first time, and thought: let's see what they do! Anyway, those groups have more skilled people. But Old Yin said, "What if all the other groups do that?" Little Foreign Devil quickly chimed in: "Exactly! If you don't have your own ideas and just listen to others, how can that be called liberation and turning over a new leaf with democracy?" People mumbled for a while, and then Little Foreign Devil introduced the opinions of groups like Shuan Cheng and Bian Xiao. The meeting immediately erupted in shouts: "That's right! Bian Xiao's idea isn't bad!" "Little Foreign Devil, you're like a new bride breaking wind! You should have said it earlier, it would have saved a lot of time!" "This is the one that isn't bad! Whoever wants to do it can do it, nobody loses." "If he's willing, then he'll definitely do a good job!" ... Old Yin suddenly remembered that organizing mutual aid and cooperation must be based on need and willingness. He had done so much in Yan Village organizing work teams! But how could he have forgotten it when it came to handicrafts? However, he also saw that the masses were truly mobilized, they had their own ideas, and didn't beat around the bush. The principle of "discussing things with the masses" was indeed the truth! But he was still worried that no one would invest, but when he looked up, he saw that nine people immediately signed up! He was overjoyed, and based on everyone's ideas, he said a few words, arranged for checking the participants' class backgrounds and selecting people to participate in land distribution, and then went to other groups.

　　He went to Tian Lu's group. He didn't enter the door, but he heard many people inside shouting: "Let's go with what we discussed yesterday! Isn't that our democratic opinion!" Tian Lu explained: The opinions of the whole village must be consistent in order to get things done; Da San then yelled, "Can one person, one opinion, be called democracy? This is a major event for the whole village! It's not just about our group!" People asked Da San to explain in more detail his plans for repairing the kiln, but he wouldn't say anything. After a lot of persuasion, Tian Lu also asked him to speak, and then the meeting immediately fell silent. After he finished speaking, Old Yin heard people whispering inside near the window: "The kiln definitely needs to be started!" "Whether you say it or not, you and I both have small family kilns, we don't necessarily have to go to the big kiln! What if the silver dollars don't come back?" "I heard that Bian Xiao's group's idea is..." "That's a good method! If it's done that way, the people who do it will be more careful, and treat it like their own business!" At this time, someone in the room also proposed Bian Xiao's method, and it was immediately passed enthusiastically, and seventeen people signed up! Old Yin simply didn't go in. When people asked him to say a few words, he refused, and turned to look for other groups. The result was: Shuan Cheng helped the women hold a meeting and agreed to Bian Xiao's method, and even his own group changed to this opinion. A total of fifty-seven people in the village participated in the shareholding, and Qian Da Nao, Yu Bao, and Xi Lu and his sons all signed up. Even the Liu Gou family insisted on participating! Old Yin couldn't help but grab Shuan Cheng and Bian Xiao, and talked about needs, voluntariness, the mass line, and so on. It was late at night, but he didn't feel sleepy.

　　Forty-nine Arrangement

　　Old Bai took some time to come to Black Stone Slope Village to inspect the work. He arrived just as the large kiln was about to start construction, so he stayed for two days and attended the first shareholders' meeting of the large kiln.

　　This meeting was convened very efficiently, and the shareholders were very enthusiastic. Only Tai Cheng, Niu Bao, and their group, who had given free labor to the Western kiln, didn't seem too happy. But after discussion, it was decided that their past work of giving free labor would also be recorded as work, and they would be paid wages if the kiln made money. They immediately relaxed, talking and laughing. The meeting then elected Shuan Cheng, Tian Lu, Da San, Xi Lu, Tai Cheng and other seven shareholder representatives, and nominated Shuan Cheng and Xi Lu as the general and deputy managers, respectively. Xi Lu refused, and after a lot of talking, it was decided that he, as the deputy manager, would only manage the accounting room, and he finally agreed. People then nominated Da San to be the supervisor. But for some reason, Da San stood up and yelled, "I can't do it!" Then he lowered his head and squatted down without speaking. People couldn't help but stare. Old Bai and Old Yin were even more surprised: it was clearly decided with him below, so why was this happening! People persuaded and questioned him. Later, Tian Lu even squatted next to him for a while and explained for a long time, and he finally turned his face and said: "I'm afraid the silver dollars will fill the sinkhole, and we won't even hear a sound!" These words were undoubtedly directed at Tai Cheng. Tai Cheng's face turned red, and he clapped his hands and said: "Uncle Da San, why are you holding on to my joke? Besides, I've already admitted my mistake! Your understanding is higher, and your skills are stronger, and I'm not distrustful of you! Even if you have opinions about me, you're delaying everyone's affairs!" Da San said, "I nominate Tai Cheng as the supervisor!" Tai Cheng hurriedly asked the crowd for help, "What are you all saying! He's deliberately picking on me!" Da San suddenly stood up, waved his hat, and shouted: "What am I picking on! Haven't I spent decades running kilns for Zhang Ju Bao? Haven't I relied on traitors to eat leftovers? Haven't I given free labor and still want to be paid! Humph, what am I!" It turned out that before the meeting, Old Bai and Old Yin had calmed down Da San's anger towards Tai Cheng. But the decision at the meeting to count Tai Cheng's free labor reignited his dissatisfaction. Tai Cheng had no choice but to pretend to be a good person and not speak, but Da San still said: "Also, traitors, spies, and landlords are just like us, becoming shareholders and opening kilns. What is the reason for this? Maybe my understanding is wrong, and Old Bai and Old Yin have given me a lot of reasons about this, but I just can't hold back this feeling!"

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（５２）
    康濯
    黑夜，老尹参加了小洋鬼这组的会。泰成果然认了错，并说他是一心赞成拿现洋闹窑：“反正有老尹作主，怕什么！”老尹忙说：“泰成可不能这么说，是浑村大伙作主！”下面却没什么人说话。小洋鬼和老尹窜通了一阵，忽然有人说：“咱这片子尽些闲工担头的，老窑黑不多，咱们就看人家别组办吧！”小洋鬼见会上架势比头一回好，也便想着：看人家就看人家呗！反正那些组把式多的。不想老尹却说：“人家组要都这么办呢？”小洋鬼忙接口道：“就是嘛！自己没主意，尽听人家，这还叫解放翻身闹民主？”人们咯嚷了一阵，小洋鬼才介绍了拴成扁小那些组的意见，会上不觉乱嚷起来：“行！扁小那意见不赖！”“小洋鬼你他妈也新媳妇放屁啦！你早说可少耽误多少工夫！”“这就是一个不赖！谁乐意谁干，谁也不吃亏。”“他自愿的，那也准干的好！”……老尹猛地想起了组织互助合作，一定要按需要和自愿，这在严村闹拨工组，自己作过多少啊！可怎么一到手工业上头，却又忘了呢？不过，他又看到这群众真是发动起来了，有主张，不含糊，到底“有事和群众商量”是千真万确的道理！只是他还着怕没人入股，但他抬头一看，却见立时就有九个人报名！他一阵高兴，就根据大家捣拉的说了说话，又安插了检查成份和推选参加分地的人，就上别的组去了。
    他去了天禄那组。他没进门去，只听得里边不少人在嚷着：“就昨天讨论的吧！那不是咱民主的意见么！”天禄就解说：浑村的意见要闹一致，才能办事；大三接着吆喝道：“一人一个意见，也能叫民主么？这他妈是浑村大事哩！又不光是咱这个组的事！”人们便叫大三再细致些说说他拾掇窑的谱谱，他却又不啃声，大家好劝说了一会，天禄也叫他说，他才开口，会上也立时不声不响了。赶他说完，老尹在窗台边听见里边有人悄悄捣拉：“窑是非闹不行！”“说不说吧，你说你我都有聚宝的小土窑动弹，咱又不一定要上大窑的！如若现洋回不来呢？”“听说扁小那组的意见是……”“那倒是个法！那么一闹，干的人也就经心啦，当成自己的事啦！”这时屋里也有人提出了扁小的办法，马上就热热闹闹通过了，而且报名的有十七个！老尹干脆不进去了，人们叫他说说话他也不，又转出来寻别的几组；结果是：拴成帮妇女们开会，同意了扁小的办法，连他自己那组也变成了这个意见；全村共参加五十七个人股，乾大脑玉宝和喜禄父子俩都报了名，连柳沟家也非要参加不行！老尹不禁乐得抓着拴成和扁小，说开了需要、自愿、群众路线什么的，天气大半夜了，他也不觉瞌睡。
    四十九　安顿
    老白抽了个工夫，来黑石坡村检查工作，正赶上这里大窑快动工，他就住了两天，参加了大窑头一次的股东大会。
    这个会召集得很利索，股东们劲头也挺大，只有泰成牛宝那伙给西窑花白工打过水的，看来不什么痛快，但后来经过讨论，决定了给他们过去打水的营生也记上工，赶窑赚了钱照发工资，他们立时就都舒眉展眼，有说有笑。会上接着选出了拴成天禄大三喜禄泰成等七个股东代表，并推拴成喜禄当正副经理，喜禄怎么也不干，说了半天，后来决定他这副经理光管柜房，他才答应。人们接着又推大三领事；但不知为什么，大三却立起来吆喝：“咱不行！”完了，他又闷着头子圪蹴下去不说话。人们不觉都瞪了眼，老白老尹更觉稀罕：明明是在下边跟他捣拉定了的嘛，这又是为什么啊！人们对他又劝说又讯问，后来天禄还靠近他圪蹴了一会，解说了半天，他才脸一撇道：“咱怕现洋填了水窟窿，还听不见个声音的！”这话不用说是正冲着泰成，泰成脸一红，拍着巴掌道：“大三叔你怎么拧住我那耍笑话不放？再说咱也认了错了的！你认识也高，把式也强，我又不是不信服你！即便是你对我有意见吧，可你这也耽误大伙的事呀！”大三道：“我提泰成领事！”泰成忙向大伙求救道：“这这你们说吧！他这是存心跟我闹别扭嘛！”大三却猛往起一立，挥着礼帽大撒手嚷起来：“我闹什么别扭！我没几十年给张聚宝闹窑，我没仗凭汉奸们吃灰食，我也没花白工打水还要记工算工钱！哼，我怎么着？”原来开会以前，老白老尹是平住了大三对泰成的火性的，这会却因为会上给泰成算水工，又挑起了他不满的劲头来；泰成只得装好人不说话，但大三还说：“再有，汉奸特务老财们也跟咱一样样当股东开窑，这可到底是他妈什么缘由，我这认识许又是错误，这上头，老白老尹也给我说过满篇道理，可我就是别不住这股劲！”
