    Shanghai Exporters to Purchase Large Quantities in Sichuan
    [This Newspaper’s Report] The shipping industry and import/export merchants in Shanghai are extremely enthusiastic after the liberation of Chongqing. As the export of Sichuan specialties is anticipated, Shanghai's Sichuan merchant groups are actively preparing goods for shipment to Chongqing in exchange for Sichuan specialties. It is reported that various Shanghai-based Sichuan river shipping companies have repeatedly received requests from various merchant groups to reserve tonnage, with export-oriented manufacturers being the most numerous, as Sichuan specialties occupy an important position in export goods. According to the China Bristle Company, Chongqing bristles are of the best quality for export pig bristles, enjoying a remarkable reputation overseas, with an estimated annual output of 18,000 dan. Tung oil production is approximately 50,000 tons per year, accounting for half of the national production, and the current inventory in Sichuan is as high as 25,000 tons. Shanghai merchants engaged in the tung oil export business are currently planning to go to Sichuan to purchase and transport it.
    According to sources from Shanghai's Minsheng Company, since the liberation of Chongqing, many people have inquired with the company about the date of the Shanghai-Chongqing shipping route opening. As Shanghai-Chongqing shipping is expected to begin this month, the company has begun accepting goods for shipment to Chongqing in order to rapidly promote material exchange.
