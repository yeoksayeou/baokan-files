　　People Scramble to Buy Stalin's Works

　　The liberated Chinese people are increasingly recognizing that the great Soviet Union is the best international friend and that Marshal Stalin is the mentor of the world revolution. Everyone wants to quickly learn from the advanced Soviet experience to build their own country. Therefore, a high tide of "learning from the Soviet Union" has been set off across the country. This is particularly evident and strong in the capital's celebration of Marshal Stalin's seventieth birthday and the spectacle of millions of readers crowding into the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore to scramble to buy Stalin's works.
　　During the birthday celebration week, major bookstores in the capital unanimously offered special discounts to readers. Large numbers of workers, students, and citizens flocked to the Xinhua Bookstore from all directions. The large number of customers disrupted the bookstore's usual working system. More than a dozen comrades who were doing other work upstairs were temporarily transferred to the front desk, but they were still overwhelmed. Six cadres were drawn from the North China General Branch, but they still couldn't handle the crowd. Finally, a group of cadres from various stores who were in Beijing for an accounting conference were also put to work at the front desk. The inside and outside of the store were packed. Bundles of new books, just placed on the shelves, were sold out in the blink of an eye. The book sales team increased from one to six. On the 17th, the upstairs dormitory was used as a temporary warehouse, and a book sales team was set up on the stairs. On the 18th, people couldn't squeeze into the bookstore, so the book sales team set up two stalls in front of the door, but the crowds of people buying books clogged the sidewalk and obstructed traffic. Later, the readers spontaneously organized themselves, collected everyone's desired book list into a single order, and sent a representative to buy them. The book sales team was reduced to two people per group, one to retrieve books and one to collect money, without even bothering to issue invoices. Despite having so many book sales teams, they were still disproportionate to the large number of readers. Everyone anxiously asked the bookstore staff who was from the bookstore. Later, a reader suggested to the bookstore, "The bookstore's badges are too small and difficult to identify in a dense crowd. It would be best to make large-character armbands of red or white cloth." A person was specially set up outside the door to stamp "Birthday Commemoration Stamps" for readers, but in less than half a day, they were too tired to lift their arms. Several people took turns stamping but still couldn't solve the problem. Finally, the readers simply took matters into their own hands, relieving the bookstore of the burden. Many people who bought books elsewhere also came to the door to get stamped. Everyone considered it an honor to have the "Celebrating Marshal Stalin's Seventieth Birthday Commemoration" stamp. The situation in front of the Sanlian Bookstore was the same.
　　Xinhua Bookstore and Sanlian Bookstore organized a "Cultural Mobile Supply Team," loaded books and people onto a large truck, and went to the streets with gongs and drums, taking advantage of the lunch break of various factories to sell books. On the 17th, they arrived at the 70th Ordnance Factory. Before they could unload the books, the workers surrounded the truck. The bookstore comrades changed their approach. One comrade took a "book sample" off the truck for everyone to choose from. The tailgate of the truck was lowered, and the truck immediately became a sales department, collecting money and handing out books at the same time. Some worker comrades, because they didn't have money readily available, held onto books like "Stalin's Biography" and "Problems of Leninism," showing infinite envy and reluctance to let go. The bookstore comrades gave them the books on credit, and the factory's accountant would collect the book money in the future. In one hour, more than 500 copies of books such as the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" were sold, with more than one million yuan in cash. The factory hadn't bought enough when the books were sold out. Workers from nearby factories came when they heard the news, but they all returned disappointed. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Staff School sent someone to the bookstore and firmly demanded that books be delivered that day. Unfortunately, the truck broke down. The bookstore had to repair the truck overnight and deliver the books early the next morning.

　　新华书店空前拥挤
    争购斯大林著作
    郑重
    解放了的中国人民，日益认清了伟大的苏联是最好的国际朋友，斯大林大元帅是世界革命的导师，都想迅速学习先进的苏联经验来建设自己的国家，因之，在全国掀起了“向苏联学习”的高潮。这在首都庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰运动中，在千万读者拥挤到北京新华书店争购斯大林著作的盛况中，表现得尤其鲜明、强烈。
    首都各大书店在祝寿运动周中，都一致举行特价优待读者。广大的工人、学生和市民，从四面八方拥到了新华书店。顾客的众多打破了书店平日的工作制度，楼上有十几个作别的工作的同志临时调到门市上来，还是应接不暇、又从华北总分店抽来六个干部，仍旧照顾不过来，最后把一批从各店来京正在举行会计会议的干部也投入门市工作中。门里门外挤得水泄不通，看车子的从一人增到三人还是忙不过来。一捆一抱的新书，刚才放到书架子上，转眼间就卖空了。售书小组从一个增加到六个。十七日把楼上宿舍作了临时书库，在楼梯上设了一个售书组。十八日人们没法挤进书店了，售书小组便到门前摆了两个摊子，但买书的人群拥塞了人行道，妨碍了交通。后来读者们就自动组织起来，把大家要买的书集中开成一个单子，推一个代表去买。售书小组缩小到每组二人，一人取书，一人收款，也顾不得再开发票。虽然有了这么多的售书小组，但和读者的众多还不成比例，急得大家满屋子问谁是书店的同志。后来有个读者便向书店提出建议，“书店的证章太小，在稠人中难以辨认，顶好制作红布或白布的大字袖章”。门口外面专设一人给读者盖“祝寿纪念章”，但不到半天就累得抬不起胳臂来了，几个人轮换着盖还不能解决问题，最后读者们干脆自己动手，解除了书店的负担。有好多人从别处买了书也到门口来盖章，大家都以盖上了“庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰纪念”的图章为光荣。三联书店的门前，也是这种情形。
    新华书店和三联书店组织了“文化流动供应队”，由大卡车装上书和人，敲锣打鼓，出动街头，乘着各工厂中午休息时间赶去卖书。十七日到了七十兵工厂，还没等得把书卸下来，工人们一下便把卡车包围了，书店同志们就变更办法，由一个同志带“书样”下车供大家挑选，把车的闸板放下来，卡车马上成了一个售卖部，一面收款一面递书。有些工人同志因为钱不方便，手中拿着斯大林传略和列宁主义问题等书，流露出无限欣羡的神色不忍释手，书店同志们便把书赊给他们，将来由该厂会计代收书款。一个钟头卖了联共党史等书五百多本，现款一百多万元。这个厂子还没十分买够，书就卖光了。附近各工厂的工友们闻风赶了来，都失望而返。市总工会职工学校派人跟到书店来，坚决要求当天给送书去，不巧卡车坏了，书店只好连夜修车，到第二天早晨方才送去。
