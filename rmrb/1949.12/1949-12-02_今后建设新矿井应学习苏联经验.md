　　In the Future, the Construction of New Mines Should Learn from Soviet Experience
    In order to improve coal quality and reduce ash content, coal washing equipment must be restored. In improving technology and increasing production efficiency, it is determined that new mines built in the future should learn from Soviet technology and experience. Each mine can strive to improve coal mining methods and increase the recovery rate according to different situations, focusing on mechanization. Organize labor scientifically, reduce surface employees, increase underground employees, divide responsibilities, cooperate closely, calculate working time in seconds, and give full play to mechanical efficiency. It is required that in 1950, each mining area should generally increase production efficiency by 20% to 30% and reduce costs by 8% to 10%. The meeting emphasized that each mining area should strengthen safety work, achieve safe production, prevent accidents, reduce accidents, carry out safety education among employees, train safety personnel, systematically improve safety facilities, and strictly establish a dedicated system for safety inspection reports. Establish a dedicated system for mining machinery to effectively protect the safety of the machines. For the future development of mines, gradually increase mechanical equipment. The Central Fuel Department plans to establish a mining machinery manufacturing management agency to unify the manufacture of coal mining machinery, and prepare to use the equipment of Fushun, Fuxin, Jixi and other electromechanical plants to expand them and gradually switch to the mass manufacture of mining machinery. In order to improve old mines, build new mines, and quickly increase production and quality, and further to overcome the difficulties of insufficient experience and lack of equipment, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry will establish a new mine construction management agency next year to concentrate experienced engineering and technical personnel from all over the country. Unify the use of materials to complete the task of building new wells. At the same time, in order to train a large number of new Chinese mine construction talents, the Central Fuel Industry Department plans to assign each coal mine administration to train technical personnel, and to absorb educated youths and technical workers for specialized education to meet the needs of various mines. Finally, in order to solve the current difficulties in the lives of mine workers, overcome the phenomenon of egalitarian wages, achieve more pay for more work, implement a piece-rate progressive bonus wage system, and ensure the continuous improvement of production capacity and technology. Solve the problem of employee dormitories, strictly implement the regulations on the payment of labor insurance fees, cultural and educational fees, and medical expenses, and develop cultural and welfare facilities for mine workers.

　　今后建设新矿井应学习苏联经验
    为了提高产煤质量，减少灰分，必须恢复选煤设备。在改进技术提高生产效率上，确定今后新建矿井，应学习苏联技术及经验。各矿可根据不同情况，力求改进采煤方法，提高回采率，有重点的走向机械化。科学的组织劳动力，减少井上员工，增加井下员工，分工负责，密切配合，以秒计算工作时间，充分发挥机械效率。要求一九五○年各矿区一般的应提高生产效率百分之二十至三十，降低成本百分之八到百分之十。会议强调提出了各矿区要加强保安工作，做到安全生产，防止事故，减少事故，在员工中开展保安教育，培养保安人员，有计划的改进保安设施，严格树立保安检查报告专责制度。对矿山机械建立专责制，切实保护机器之安全，为了今后矿山之发展，逐渐增加机械设备，中央燃料部计划设立矿山机械制造管理机构，统一进行煤矿机械的制造，并准备利用抚顺、阜新、鸡西等机电厂设备，予以扩充，逐渐转入大量的制造矿山机械，为了改善旧矿井，建设新矿井，迅速提高产量质量，更为了克服经验不足，器材缺乏的困难，中央燃料工业部将于明年设立新矿井建设管理机构，集中全国有经验的工程技术人员。统一使用材料，完成建设新井的任务。同时为了大批培养新中国的矿山建设人材，中央燃料工业部计划各煤矿管理局分工培养技术人员，吸收知识青年与技术职工予以专门教育，以应各矿山之需要。最后，为了解决目前矿山职工生活困难，克服平均主义工资现象，作到多劳多得，实行计件累进奖励工资制，保证生产能率及技术之不断提高。解决职工宿舍，厉行支付劳保费，文教费，医药费等规定，开展矿山职工文化福利设施。
