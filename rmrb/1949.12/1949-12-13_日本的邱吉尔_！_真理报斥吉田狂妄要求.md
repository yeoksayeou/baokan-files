Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: TASS Moscow, December 8th: *Pravda* published an article by Mayevsky entitled "Japan's Churchill," which stated: Everyone knows the ugly face of the warmonger Churchill. However, in addition to the Churchill of England, there is also a "Churchill of Japan." This is the nickname the newspaper gave to the current Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida. It should be pointed out that they have every reason to call him that. In the past, Yoshida was one of the authors who, under the supervision of General Tanaka, drafted the heinous plans for Japan's invasion of Northeast China and other countries. Now, in order to ingratiate himself with his American masters, he has resolutely decided not to lag behind Churchill in his provocative tricks.

　　Yoshida, in his speech to the Diet a few days ago, stated that he "hopes" to see the Kuril Islands, which belong to the Soviet Union, become "Japanese territory." He fully supports the impudent demands of certain right-wing socialists, such as Nishimura, lackeys of imperialism, on Soviet territory.

　　In order to divert the people's attention from the fact that Japan has become a private property of Wall Street, the Japanese reactionaries are completely following the American plan and inciting revanchist tendencies. They are still dreaming of occupying foreign lands and are greatly irritated that the Kuril Islands can no longer be used as a bridgehead for aggression against the Soviet Union.

　　Wouldn't the American warmongers and their servants in Japan be beaming with joy if the Kuril Islands became part of the network of bases that American imperialism is building around the world? However, no matter how much this Japanese Churchill and other Churchills shout, they will not be able to do this.

### “日本的邱吉尔”！　真理报斥吉田狂妄要求

　　“日本的邱吉尔”！
  　真理报斥吉田狂妄要求
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科八日讯：真理报刊载马耶夫斯基题为“日本的邱吉尔”的论文称：战争贩子邱吉尔那副丑恶的样子是谁都知道的。但是，除了英国的邱吉尔之外，还有一个“日本的邱吉尔”。这是报纸给日本现任首相吉田所起的绰号。应该指出：它们完全有理由来这样称呼他。在过去，吉田是在田中将军监督之下起草日本侵略中国的东北和其他国家的罪恶计划的作者之一。他现在为了专心向美国主子邀宠，已断然决定他在挑拨伎俩上决不要有一处落后于邱吉尔。
    吉田数日前在国会的演说中，表示他“希望”看到属于苏联的千岛群岛，变成“日本的领土”。他充分支持某些帝国主义的仆从右翼社会党西村之流对苏联领土的无礼要求。
    日本反动派为了使人民群众不注意日本已变成华尔街的私产，正在完全按照美国的计划，煽动复仇主义的倾向。他们仍在梦想占领外国的土地。并为千岛群岛不能再充作侵略苏联的桥头堡垒而大为激怒。
    要是千岛群岛成为美帝国主义者正在全世界建立的基地网中的一环，美国战争贩子和他们在日本的仆从们难道还不会高兴得眉开眼笑吗？但是，不管这个日本的邱吉尔和其他的邱吉尔怎样叫嚷，这一点是他们办不到的。
