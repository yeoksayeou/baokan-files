　　Sisters Who Escaped the Fire Pit
    Pei Lan
    Prostitutes: these are women who fundamentally do not believe in any goodwill in the world. Their experiences in the old society – being sold, deceived, insulted, and violated – have turned their hearts as cold as ice. However, in Beijing, the capital of New China, a miracle is now occurring: prostitutes are beginning to universally feel that there truly are people and organizations that are genuinely saving them from the sea of suffering.

    When the Beijing Municipal Government closed the brothels and concentrated over 1,290 prostitutes to establish a production and education center, the intentions of the People's Government were not yet understood by the prostitutes. They even believed the rumors spread by the madams and pimps: "Maybe one day they'll load you all onto trucks and send you to the Northeast to be paired with coal miners," "They'll sell you off for thirty yuan apiece!" Because of this, they cried, made trouble, some refused to eat… But the facts that followed quickly led them to reject their original thoughts.

    On the night of the initial gathering, everyone's belongings were left in the original brothels. When the government sent two large trucks to help them move their belongings after the concentration, they all thought their things were doomed, to be confiscated or embezzled (this was their experience in the old society); but strangely, not a single thread was missing from their belongings, and they were returned to them intact. Zong Xiangfei had three gold rings and thought they would definitely be lost, but all of them were returned to her. Some people who originally didn't have quilts or cotton clothes were given help by the center after arriving. Many also had contracted various venereal diseases in the past, so the government organized a medical team of about sixty people to specifically examine and treat them; more than a dozen people were addicted to opium, and the medical team specially prescribed a medicine for them to take. Now, most don't even need the medicine anymore. Li Qiuyan, who had been addicted to opium for several years, completely quit in just over ten days. The prostitutes discussed among themselves: "Our parents sold us, but the government saved us from the fire pit. Although our parents loved us, they had no way to save us."

    After the establishment of the Production and Education Center, the staff of each unit lived with them, helping them study. The heads of the center also frequently visited each unit to understand their lives, studies, and health conditions. More than thirty female workers from the clothing factory went to visit them, and the Peking University Medical College, Normal University, Chong Ci, Bei Man and other girls' middle schools, and the New China Women's Vocational School also wrote letters to express their sympathy, and raised funds for some paper, pens, ink, toothpaste, towels, and over 5.1 million RMB to help them solve difficulties in their studies and lives. The heartfelt comfort brought the trainees a warmth they had never enjoyed before. The trainees said with emotion: "Who used to look up to us! Today, the world has changed!"

    "We have now found a truly reliable home!" This is a truth they have experienced from their actual lives. Many trainees voluntarily tell their life stories and report the situations of other trainees, as if to their own family members. They sincerely express that they want to study hard here and return home to engage in production after studying well.

    Now, these women who were recently being humiliated and trampled upon have begun to live healthy and happy lives, changing their abnormal living habits. They study in shifts, elect class leaders, and establish schedules. They wake up at eight in the morning and go to bed at nine in the evening, study for four hours in the morning and afternoon, and engage in cultural and recreational activities after dinner. Those who are literate teach those who are illiterate to learn to read and write letters, and everyone helps each other wash clothes and clean up. They automatically take turns on duty and manage themselves.

    Their enthusiasm for learning is very high. Of the 1,290 trainees, 80 percent are illiterate, and now they are all actively asking to open their minds and learn to read. Trainee Qiao Lingyun used duck egg powder, which she used to use to powder her face, to replace chalk and write on a wooden board. The center issued notebooks and pencils to the trainees who lacked paper and pens, and they were extremely happy. They practiced in their notebooks whenever they had time. Staff members frequently introduce books such as "The Story of Liu Hulan" and "The Unyielding Hou Wu's Wife" to the literate trainees. Sixteen-year-old Li Shuqin said: "Liu Hulan was only sixteen years old, and she was so brave. I want to learn from her!" The older ones did not have much confidence in learning to read and asked to learn skills. The center immediately consulted with relevant departments to recruit work based on their requirements.

    Trainees from the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh units wrote and performed a play describing how they were beaten by the pimps, suffered the anger of the bosses, and lived an inhuman life. Many people couldn't help but shed tears after watching it. People who had consistently believed that suffering this kind of pain was their fate began to reject their past understanding. The first- and second-class prostitutes, who had always looked down on the third- and fourth-class prostitutes, now began to realize that everyone was an insulted and violated sister. They unanimously demanded that the flesh-eating, blood-drinking, conscienceless bosses and pimps be punished.

    The slogan "New women must rely on labor to eat" began to appear in their dormitories. This is the path for them to start a new life.

　　跳出火坑的姐妹们
    培蓝
    妓女，这是一部分根本不相信世界上还有任何善意的女人。她们在旧社会里被出卖、被欺骗、被侮辱与蹂躏的身世，使她们的心肠变成冰一样冷。但是，在新中国的首都北京，现在却出现了一个奇迹——妓女们开始普遍感觉到人世间真有这样的人和机关，真正来拯救她们脱离苦海。
    在京市府封闭妓院，将一千二百九十多妓女集中起来成立生产教养院之初，人民政府的意图还不能为妓女们所了解，她们甚至相信老板领家的造谣：“说不定那一天就把你们一大卡车押到东北去，配给煤黑子（掘煤工人），”“三十元一个，就把你们卖掉了！”为此，她们哭、闹，有的不吃饭，……但是，以后的事实迅速地使她们否定了原来的想法。
    开始集中的那天晚上，他们每个的人东西都放在原来的妓院里。集中后，公家派两部大卡车给她们搬东西时，她们都觉得自己的东西是完蛋了，要被没收或贪污了（这是她们在旧社会所经历过的）；但是奇怪，她们的东西边一针一线都没有遗失，原封不动地还给了她们。宗香妃有三个金戒指，以为一定要丢失的，不想一个也不少的交还了她。有些原就没有被子和棉衣的人，到院后，院部也尽力帮助她们解决了。也有不少的过去传染了各种性病，政府组织了约六十人的医务组，专给她们检查治疗；十多个人有大烟瘾，医务组专门配了一种药品给她们吃，现在大半连药品也不用吃了。李秋燕好几年的烟瘾，十几天完全戒掉了，妓女们纷纷舆论着：“爹娘卖了我们，政府把我们救出火坑。爹娘虽然爱我们，可是她们没有办法救我们。”
    生产教养院成立后，各所工作人员和她们生活在一起，帮助她们学习，院部负责人也经常到各所去了解她们的生活、学习及疾病情形，被服厂三十多个女工去慰问她们，北大医学院、师大、崇慈、贝满等女中，新中国妇女职业学校也写信慰问她们，还募捐了她些纸、笔、墨水、牙粉、毛巾及人民币五十一万余元，送给她们解决学习生活上的困难。亲切的安慰带给学员们从来未曾享受过的温暖。学员们感慨的说：“过去谁看得起我们！今天，世道大变了！”
    “我们现在找到了真正可靠的家！”这是她们从实际生活中体验到的一个真理。许多学员自动诉说自己的身世，并反映其她学员的情况，象对自己家里人一样。并诚恳表示，她们要在这里好好学习，学习好后回家生产。
    现在这些不久以前还在被凌辱、践踏的女人，已经开始健康、愉快的生活，改变了不正常的生活习惯，她们分班学习，选举了班长，制订了作息时间，早晨八点钟起床，晚上九点钟睡觉，上、下午学习四个钟头，晚饭后进行文化娱乐活动。识字的教不识字的学习认字、写信，大家互相帮助洗衣服，打扫清洁卫生，她们自动轮流值日，自己管理自己。
    她们学习的情绪很高。一千二百九十名学员，有百分之八十是文盲，现在都积极要求开脑筋，学识字。学员乔灵芸用几天前擦脸用的鸭蛋粉代替粉笔，在木板上写字，院部给缺乏纸笔的学员发了练习簿和铅笔，她们高兴极了，一有空就在本子上练习。工作人员经常介绍“刘胡兰的故事”、“坚贞不屈的侯五嫂”等书给识字的学员们看，十六岁的李淑琴说：“刘胡兰也只有十六岁，就那么勇敢，我要好好学习她！”年龄较大的对学习识字信心不大，要求学习技术，院部即依据她们的要求，尽力和各有关部门协商，招揽活计。
    一、二、三、四、五、七所的学员们，自己编演了一出话剧，描述自己怎样被领家吊打，受老板的气，过着非人的生活，许多人看后不禁流下泪来。过去一贯认为受这种痛苦是命该如此的人，今天也开始否定过去的认识了。过去头二等妓女一贯看不起三、四等妓女，现在开始认识到：大伙都是被侮辱被蹂躏的姐妹了。她们一致要求惩处那吃肉喝人血，伤天害理的老板领家。
    “新妇女要靠劳动吃饭”的标语，开始出现在她们的宿舍里，这就是她们今后重新做人的道路。
