Some Experiences in Making New Picture Strips
    Cui Wei, Branch of the Beijing Municipal First People's Education Center

    Remodeling old picture strips and creating new ones is no longer a new endeavor in the old liberated areas of China, especially in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, where there have been good experiences and works. However, the fact that this work still needs to be widely promoted cannot be denied.
    This time, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal People's Education Center, I drew the new picture strip "Liu Hulan". In the process of drawing, I gained the following immature experiences.

    Do not stick to the single-line flat coating method in calligraphy
    The single-line flat coating method is to use black lines to outline the contours and then apply colors flatly. Because it can give people a clear concept, it is often used in general folk art, especially in New Year pictures. This time, I also mostly adopted this painting method, but I did not stick to this painting method. I also used the realistic techniques of light and shade and perspective of Western painting to increase the sense of reality of the picture. Some pictures also use the color tone unification method of Western painting to give the picture a unified emotion. For example, Liu Hulan braving the snow to comfort the troops uses cool colors; Shi Sanhai and Stone secretly discussing how to harm Liu Hulan uses a dark tone. According to the reactions I heard, this method is acceptable to the masses, and the impression felt is even deeper. This shows that the degree to which the masses accept art will not be as low as some people imagine, and what the masses like to see and hear is not necessarily just the rigid single-line flat coating method.

    One picture strip may as well narrate two facts
    New picture strips cannot have as many pages as comic books. One picture strip can depict multiple facts, which is often used in old picture strips. This time, I drew Liu Hulan's rescue of the wounded and the liberation of Chen Wuzi together. The conversation between Liu's mother and the commander and the People's Liberation Army's march, and the masses' support for the front, are also drawn together. This not only saves space but also makes the picture full and lively, which is more popular with the masses.
    However, when using this method, do not forget the theme of the picture, do not destroy the unity of the picture, and also distinguish the time and order when explaining.

    Pay attention to the portrayal of characters
    This time, because I did not have a good painting foundation, the character portrayal was very poor. However, I adopted a remedy, which is to use the characters' clothing and colors to help the masses analyze the characters. This method can also be used by people with poor painting foundations.

### 制作新洋片的几点经验

　　制作新洋片的几点经验
    北京市立第一人民教育馆分馆  崔巍
    改造旧洋片，创作新洋片，在中国老解放区已不算是一种新的尝试了，特别是在陕甘宁边区里，已有了很好的经验与作品出现。但是这种工作，现在还须要普遍推广的事实也是不可否认的。
    这一次，我在北京市立民教馆领导下，绘制了新洋片“刘胡兰”。在绘制过程中，获得以下几点不太成熟的经验。
    在书法上不要拘泥于单线平涂法
    单线平涂法，就是用黑线条勾勒轮廓，颜色平涂的方法。因为他能给人以明确的概念，为一般民间艺术，特别是年画里经常地采用。我这次也多半采用了这种画法，但是我没有拘泥于这种画法，也采用了西洋画的明暗、透视的写实手法，使画面增加了现实的感觉。有些画面也采用西洋画的色调统一的方法，使画面给人以统一情绪，象刘胡兰冒雪劳军，就采用了寒色调子；石三海与石头密议谋害刘胡兰，就采了阴暗的调子。根据我听到的反应，这种手法群众是可以接受的，并且所感受的印象更深。这说明群众接受艺术的程度不会如有些人所想象的那么低，群众所喜见乐闻的也不见得只是呆板的单条平涂法。
    一张洋片无妨叙述两个事实
    新洋片不能象连环画那样篇幅多，在一张洋片可以把多种事实绘制上去，这在旧洋片中是经常使用的。我这次把刘胡兰救治伤员和解放陈五子，就绘在一起。把刘母和司令员谈话，与人民解放军的进军，群众的支前，也绘在一起。这样不但节省篇幅，而且使画面饱满、热闹，更为群众所欢迎。
    但是用这个方法不要忘掉了画面的主题，不要破坏了画面的统一，讲解时候也要分清时间、次序。
    要注意人物的刻划
    这次因为我没有很好的绘画基础，人物的刻划很差。不过我采用了一个补救的办法，就是用人物的服装和色彩来帮助群众分析人物。这办法一般绘画基础较差的人也无妨使用。
