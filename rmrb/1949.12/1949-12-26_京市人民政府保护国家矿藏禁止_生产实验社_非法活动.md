Beijing Municipal People's Government Protects National Mineral Deposits, Prohibits Illegal Activities of "Production Experiment Cooperative"
[Beijing News] In order to protect national mineral deposits and prohibit private kiln mining in the Mentougou mining area, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has ordered the "Mentougou Private Small Coal Mine Voluntary Collective Production Experiment Cooperative Preparatory Office" to cease its illegal activities. The Mentougou Coal Mine, operated by the Jingxi Coal Mine Company, has a mining area of approximately 568 hectares, 73 acres, 17 square millimeters. It was taken over by the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan. When the Kuomintang confiscated it after the victory, there were no small kilns mining illegally in the mining area. However, due to the lax discipline and bureaucratic monopoly of the Kuomintang reactionary government, privileged individuals took advantage of the situation to privately open small kilns in the mining area. From 1946 to 1948, as many as 256 small kilns were opened successively. In the area of one kilometer long and half a kilometer wide near Dayu Gully, there were 112 small kilns. Because each small kiln only aimed at its immediate private interests, they competed to seize resources, disregarding engineering, failing to drain accumulated water, tunneling through each other underground, and not leaving coal pillars. During the rainy season, the surface cracked, and mountain floods poured down, causing all the mines to be flooded simultaneously, further affecting the mining of lower coal seams, which was very harmful to the coalfield. After liberation, in order to protect national mineral deposits, the government ordered the closure of private mining kilns in the Mentougou mining area; at the same time, it made every effort to support the small kilns in the private mining area in western Mentougou. Currently, 161 kilns have resumed operation, producing 3,000 tons of coal per day, which has exceeded the past output of earthen kilns. However, recently, some of the closed small kilns, using excuses such as "severe coal shortage," "worker unemployment," and "suffering of disaster victims," gathered more than ten small kilns such as Fengyuan, Chengxing, and Jicheng, and without the approval of the People's Government, privately organized the so-called "Mentougou Private Small Coal Mine Voluntary Collective Production Experiment Cooperative Preparatory Office" in an attempt to resume their theft mining in the public mining area. The cooperative, on the one hand, used the name of increasing production to publicize requests for resumption of work; at the same time, it instigated workers to secretly steal coal from small kilns, and the government has uncovered more than 30 cases. In view of this, the Beijing Municipal People's Government issued an order on December 20 to prohibit the resumption of work of private small kilns in the Mentougou mining area, and to stop all activities of the "Mentougou Private Small Coal Mine Voluntary Collective Production Experiment Cooperative Preparatory Office."

　　京市人民政府保护国家矿藏禁止“生产实验社”非法活动
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府为保护国家矿藏，禁止门头沟矿区私窑盗采，明令“门头沟民营小型煤矿自愿集体生产实验社筹备处”停止非法活动。京西煤矿公司所经营之门头沟煤矿，其矿区面积约为五百六十八公顷七十三公亩一十七公厘，抗战中被日寇接管，胜利后国民党没收时，矿区内并无一家小窑盗采。但由于国民党反动政府政纪废弛，官僚垄断，特权即依势在矿区内私开小窑，一九四六年至一九四八年三年间，相继开凿小窑达二百五十六座之多。在大峪沟附近长一公里、宽半公里面积内即有小窑一百一十二座，因各小窑只以目前的私利为目的，故争相抢夺，不顾工程，不排积水，窑下互相穿透，不留煤柱，至雨季，则地表龟裂，山洪下注，使各矿同时被淹，并进而影响下层煤藏之开采，对煤田之妨害甚为严重。解放后，政府为保护国家矿藏，对门矿区内私采小窑分别予以停闭；同时对门头沟西部私人矿区内之小窑，则尽力予以扶植，现在开工者已达一百六十一座，日产煤三千吨，已超过往年土窑量。但近来部分被封之小窑，竟以“煤荒严重”、“工人失业”、“灾民困苦”等为借口，纠集丰源、诚兴、集成等十数家小窑，未经人民政府批准，即私自组织所谓“门头沟民营小型煤矿自愿集体生产实验社筹备处”企图在公矿区内，恢复其盗采。该社一面以增加生产为名，宣传请求复工；同时更唆使工人私下小窑偷煤，已经政府查获者达三十余起。北京市人民政府有鉴于此，乃于十二月二十日有令禁止门矿区内私营小窑之复工，并停止该“门头沟民营小型煤矿自愿集体生产实验社筹备处”之一切活动。
