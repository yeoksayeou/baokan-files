　　The People of Mentougou Eliminate a Great Evil
　　Traitor and Special Agent Wang Zhenhai Executed
    [Beijing News] Yesterday (the 15th), the Military Law Office of the Beijing Military Control Commission held a court session in Mentougou. Based on the accusations and demands of the people of Mentougou District, Wang Zhenhai, a traitor and special agent who murdered revolutionary cadres, coerced and beat military dependents, and harmed the people, was sentenced to death according to law and executed immediately. The local people were overjoyed. This criminal, nicknamed "Old Man Heaven," served as a squad leader and intelligence agent for the Japanese puppet regime and the Kuomintang bandit gang's puppet self-defense force from 1938 until the liberation of Beijing. Relying on the power of the enemy and puppet regimes, he successively murdered People's Liberation Army workers Yang Xiaowen and Zhang Yulong, as well as villager Liu Zhensheng, and others; tortured village cadres Gao Jingxing and eight others; coerced and beat military dependents Liu Changshan and more than ten others. The father of military dependent Zhang Yulong and the son of Zhao Shuhe died as a result. He took advantage of his power to force military dependent Sun Yaohuan and many villagers to become displaced, or extorted valuable property from them. In addition, he forced the widow Lu Gaosheng into sexual relations and lured twelve militiamen, including Gao Xiaolong, to join the puppet army, committing numerous crimes. After the liberation of Beijing, the people in the Mentougou area reported the crimes to the Mentougou Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the District People's Government. More than thirty written accusations were filed. After being arrested, the criminal remained cunning and showed no signs of repentance. At the court session yesterday, victims and relatives of the victims, including Zhang Yucheng, Yang Shan, Zhang Tingzhen, Cui Tingxun, Liu Xinglin, and Wang Laodao, accused the criminal of his crimes. Three thousand villagers present at the court unanimously demanded justice and revenge for the victims. The Military Law Office of the Municipal Military Control Commission executed the criminal according to law.
