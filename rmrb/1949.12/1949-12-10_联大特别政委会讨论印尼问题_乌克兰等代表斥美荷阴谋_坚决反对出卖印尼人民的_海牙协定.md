　　UN Special Political Committee Discusses Indonesian Question
  　Ukrainian and Other Representatives Denounce US-Dutch Conspiracy
    Firmly Oppose the "Hague Agreement" that Sells Out the Indonesian People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th] TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee began discussing the Indonesian question on December 3rd.

    As is well known, as a result of the deal between the representatives of the Dutch government and the "representatives" of the Republic of Indonesia at the so-called Hague Round Table Conference, an agreement has been reached on the establishment of the so-called "United States of Indonesia," which will become part of the Dutch-Indonesian Federation under the rule of the Dutch Queen.

    At the meeting on December 3rd, the Indian representative, Mr. Rau, who first spoke, submitted a proposal on behalf of fourteen countries (Afghanistan, Australia, Burma, the Kuomintang, Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen), expressing welcome to the Hague Agreement, "expressing gratitude" to the participants in the Round Table Conference, and congratulating "the imminent establishment of the independent state—the United States of Indonesia—as an independent sovereign nation."

    The history of the United Nations' discussion of the Indonesian question is filled with attempts by US and British representatives to obstruct a fair solution to the problem. There is no doubt who the real author of this proposal is.

    The proposal was immediately supported by the US representative, Mr. Austin, who praised the Hague Agreement, saying that it guaranteed a stable solution to the Indonesian problem.

    The Dutch representative urged the members of the Committee to forget the past and only look to the future. As is well known, past events have proven that the Dutch government has repeatedly violated its obligations. He attempted to defend the Hatta group, who sat with the Dutch colonialists in The Hague, and attempted to make this group the representative of the Indonesian people.

　　联大特别政委会讨论印尼问题
  　乌克兰等代表斥美荷阴谋
    坚决反对出卖印尼人民的“海牙协定”
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会于十二月三日开始讨论印尼问题。
    如所周知，由于荷兰政府的代表与印尼共和国的“代表”在所谓海牙圆桌会议上的交易，关于成立所谓“印尼合众国”的协议已经达成，这个国家将成为隶属于荷兰女王统辖之下的荷兰印尼联邦的一部分。
    在十二月三日的会议上，第一个发言的印度代表劳氏，代表十四个国家（阿富汗、澳大利亚、缅甸、国民党、埃及、印度、伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚及也门）提出议案，表示欢迎海牙协定，对圆桌会议的参加者“表示谢意”，并庆贺“作为独立主权国家的独立国——印尼合众国的不久成立”。
    联合国在讨论印尼问题的历史上，充满了美英代表阻挠这个问题公平解决的企图，这个提案的真正作者是谁是毫无疑问的。
    这个提案立即得到美国代表奥斯汀的支持，他夸奖海牙协定，说它保证了印尼问题稳定的解决。
    荷兰代表力促委员会的各委员国忘掉过去而只展望将来，如所周知，过去的事情证明荷兰政府一再违背它的义务，他企图为那个在海牙与荷兰殖民者坐在一起的哈达集团辩解，企图使这个集团成为印尼人民的代表。
