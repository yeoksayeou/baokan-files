Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in order to further unify trade union organizations in various regions to adapt to the new unified national situation, recently issued a "Notice on Establishing Ten National Industrial Trade Unions in the Next Six Months," requiring local trade unions, under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, to officially establish ten national industrial trade unions, including railway, postal and telecommunications, seafarers, textile, and fuel, before May of next year (1950). The full text of the notice is as follows:

    Establishing unified national industrial trade union organizations is necessary to unify efforts in production, facilitate education, research, and the formulation of unified wage systems and welfare benefits.

    (1) The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has been established, and China has formed an unprecedentedly unified situation. Under this new unified national situation, all aspects of work require further unification and centralization. Our working class mass organization—the trade union organization—was in a dispersed guerrilla warfare environment for a long time in the past. Although it also organized workers according to the principle of industry, it had to establish trade union organizations on a local basis. Therefore, in the past long period, the local federation of trade unions was the most important link in the national trade union organization system. At the same time, it will still not lose its important significance in the foreseeable future. However, now all important industrial sectors and cultural and educational sectors in the country have unified national administrative management agencies in the Central People's Government, and furthermore, there will soon be unified national economic plans, production plans, management systems, wage treatment methods, and so on. In this way, there must be unified trade union organizations in various national industrial sectors to concentrate the opinions of the national working class masses and unify their actions for production and construction, and give play to the contribution of the working class and its trade union organizations to the great cause of production and construction; it is also convenient to carry out political, cultural, and technical education for the working class according to the special conditions of each industrial sector, and more systematically improve the consciousness and cultural and technical level of the working class; at the same time, it also facilitates the research and formulation of unified wage systems and employee welfare benefits methods for various national industrial sectors. If we do not establish national industrial trade union organizations according to these industrial sectors, and still disperse these industrial workers in the organizations of local trade unions, it will inevitably hinder the unity of the industry, fail to meet the requirements of the objective situation, and fail to fulfill the due role of the above-mentioned industrial trade unions.

    At present, those with the conditions to establish national organizations include: railway, postal and telecommunications, seafarers, textile, fuel, hardware, food, educators, publishing and printing, and stevedores trade unions.

    (2) At present, those with the conditions to establish national industrial trade union organizations include: railway, postal and telecommunications (or postal and telecommunications separated), seafarers, textile, fuel (or coal mining and electrical power separated), hardware (including military industry), food, educators, publishing and printing, and stevedores trade unions, a total of ten or twelve industrial trade unions. Except for the railway, postal, and telecommunications three industrial trade unions, which are already formally preparing, the rest are just beginning (such as textile, coal mining, and seafarers) or have not yet started. Therefore, immediately starting the work of establishing these industrial trade unions is an important organizational task in the current national workers' movement. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and its subordinate local trade union organizations must, from now on, take the establishment of these industrial trade union organizations as the focus of their current organizational work, and must formally establish the above industrial trade unions from now until May of next year (1950). The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is responsible for formulating the plan and steps for establishing these industrial trade unions in the next six months, as well as the scope included by each industrial trade union, and notify the preparatory committees of each industrial trade union and the national local federations of trade unions to implement it uniformly.

    (3) The basic method for establishing national industrial trade unions is to convene employee representative meetings of various industrial sectors in a planned and prepared manner, and establish preparatory committees for each industrial trade union. Those who already have a preparatory committee and whose preparatory work has been completed can convene employee representative congresses of various industrial sectors, elect the national committee of each industrial trade union, and formally establish the industrial trade union. The agenda of the national employee representative meetings or congresses of various industries should generally include the following three main items:

    The agenda of the industrial employee representative meeting should include three main items: production, collective contracts, and trade union organization.

    First, production issues: Identify the major problems that must be solved and can be solved in the current production of the industry, and discuss and solve them (such as the responsibility system of the railway trade union, etc.).

    Second, collective contract issues: Each industrial sector should have the general trade union, representing all workers and staff, sign a unified collective contract for the industry with the administrative authority. The content of the collective contract should be determined based on our level of preparation and objective circumstances. If we are able to stipulate more comprehensive labor conditions (such as working hours, wages, labor protection issues, etc.), we will stipulate them comprehensively; if we cannot stipulate them completely for the time being, we can first select one or two issues that can be stipulated uniformly to stipulate them. For the collective contracts of industrial sectors including private units (such as the textile industry, etc.), we can first stipulate a general outline of the collective contract. Under the unified principles stipulated in the outline, we will then stipulate them specifically according to the local conditions and factory conditions. Once each representative meeting concludes and the trade union is formally established, it should sign this collective contract with the industrial authority. Discussing collective contract issues should be the central agenda of all industrial trade union representative meetings.

    Third, trade union organization issues: At the representative meeting, the organizational charter of each trade union should be adopted and the method of organizing grassroots trade unions should be formulated.

    (4) For representatives of representative meetings or congresses, if there are lower-level trade union organizations, the lower-level trade union organizations should convene member meetings or representative congresses to elect them; for departments where there are no lower-level trade union organizations (such as cultural and educational departments, etc.), the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should convene a certain meeting to first establish a preparatory committee, and then promote the organization from top to bottom. For the organizational work of establishing the above-mentioned industrial trade unions, the national local trade unions should actively guide the existing grassroots trade union organizations to carry out the above-mentioned preparation work according to instructions, and for those who do not have grassroots trade union organizations, they should immediately help them organize in a planned manner to complete the task of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to establish these industrial trade unions.

　　中华全国总工会发出通知
　  建立十个全国产业总工会
    要求各地方工会帮助在明年五月以前完成
    【新华社北京二十五日电】中华全国总工会为进一步统一各地的工会组织，以适应全国统一的新形势，特于日前发出“关于在最近半年内建立十个全国产业总工会的通知”，要求各地方工会在中华全国总工会领导下，在明年（一九五○年）五月以前将铁路、邮电、海员、纺织、燃料等十个全国性的产业工会正式建立起来。通知全文如下：
    建立全国统一的产业工会组织，才能统一努力生产的行动，便于进行教育，研究与规定统一的工资制度与福利待遇办法。
    （一）中华人民共和国中央人民政府业已成立，中国业已形成空前统一的局面，在此全国统一的新形势下，各方面的工作都要求进一步的统一与集中。我们工人阶级的群众组织——工会组织，过去长期处在分散的游击战争的环境之中，虽然也是按照产业的原则去组织工人的，但不得不以地方为单位去建立工会的组织。因此，在过去这一长时期中，地方总工会是全国工会组织系统中之最重要的一环。同时，在今后相当时间中仍不失去其重要意义。但现在全国各重要产业部门及文化教育部门，在中央人民政府这中，均已有了全国统一的行政管理机关，而且进一步即将要有全国统一的经济计划、生产计划、管理制度、工资待遇办法等等。这样，必须要有全国各产业部门统一的工会组织，方可集中全国工人阶级群众的意见，并统一其为生产建设而努力的行动，发挥工人阶级及其工会组织对于生产建设伟大事业的贡献；也才便于按照各个产业部门的特殊条件去进行工人阶级的政治、文化、技术教育，更有计划地提高工人阶级的觉悟程度与文化、技术水平；同时，也便利于研究与规定全国各个产业部门统一的工资制度与职工福利待遇办法。如果再不按照这些产业部门去建立起全国性的各个产业工会组织，而仍将这些产业工人分散在各个地方工会的组织之中，就必然要妨碍产业的统一性，不能适应客观形势的要求，尽到上述产业工会应有的作用。
    目前有条件建立全国性组织的，计有：铁路、邮电、海员、纺织、燃料、五金、食品、教育工作者、出版印刷事业、搬运工人等十个产业总工会。
    （二）在目前已有条件去建立全国性的产业总工会的组织者，计有：铁路、邮电（或邮政、电信两个分开）、海员、纺织、燃料（或煤矿与电气事业两个分开）、五金（包括军工）、食品、教育工作者、出版印刷事业、搬运工人等十个或十二个产业总工会。以上除铁路、邮政、电信三个产业总工会已在正式着手筹备外，其余均方在开始（如纺织、煤矿、海员）或尚未开始。因此，立即开始建立这些产业总工会的工作，乃是当前全国工人运动中在组织上的重要的任务。中华全国总工会及其所属各地方的工会组织，自即日起，必须以建立这些产业工会的组织为当前组织工作的重心，并须从现在起到明年（一九五○年）五月以前，将以上这些产业总工会正式建立起来，并由中华全国总工会负责拟制关于最近半年内建立这些产业总工会的计划、步骤与各个产业总工会所包括的范围，通知各产业总工会筹备委员会及全国各地方总工会，统一按此执行。
    （三）建立全国各个产业总工会的基本方法是：有计划、有准备地召集各产业部门的职工代表会议，成立各产业总工会的筹备委员会。已有筹备委员会且其筹备工作业已就绪者，即可召集各产业部门的职工代表大会，选举各产业总工会的全国委员会，正式成立该产业总工会。全国各产业职工代表会议或代表大会的议事日程，一般的应包括以下三项主要内容：
    产业职工代表会议事日程，应包括生产，集体合同，工会组织等三项主要内容。
    第一、生产问题：应找出本产业当前生产中必须解决与可能解决的重大问题，加以讨论与解决（如铁路工会的负责制问题等）。
    第二、集体合同问题：各产业部门均应由总工会代表全体工人和职员与行政主管机关签订该产业部门之统一的集体合同。集体合同的内容，应视我们准备的程度及客观情况而定，能够规定比较全面的劳动条件者（如工时、工资、劳动保护问题等），即全面规定之；一时不能规定完备者，可先择一两个可以统一规定的问题规定之。包括有私营单位的产业部门（如纺织业等）的集体合同，可先规定一个一般的总的集体合同纲要，在纲要所规定的统一原则下，再分别按照各地各厂情况具体规定之。每一个代表会议结束，工会正式成立，即应与该产业主管机关，签定此项集体合同。讨论集体合同问题，应为所有产业工会代表会议的中心议程。
    第三、工会组织问题：在代表会议中应通过各该工会组织章程并制定工会基层组织方法。
    （四）代表会议或代表大会之代表，已有下层工会组织者，由下层工会组织召集会员大会或代表大会选举生产之；尚无下层工会组织之部门（如文化教育部门等），由全国总工会召集一定的会议，先将筹备委员会建立起来，再自上而下地推动组织之。全国各地方工会对于建立上述各产业工会的组织工作，对已有基层工会组织者，应根据指示积极指导其进行上述各项准备工作，对于尚无基层工会组织者，应立即有计划地帮助他们组织起来，完成全国总工会关于建立各该产业总工会之任务。
