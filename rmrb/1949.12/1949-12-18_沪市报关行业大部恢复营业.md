　　Shanghai Customs Brokerage Industry Largely Resumes Operations
    [By Our Correspondent] With the significant progress in the exchange of goods between domestic and foreign markets, Shanghai's transportation and customs brokerage firms have resumed operations one after another. According to statistics, there are more than 350 transportation and customs brokerage firms in Shanghai. Since September, due to the gradual expansion of business, 170 transportation and customs brokerage firms (mainly engaged in land transportation) have fully resumed operations, and about 120 firms specializing in customs brokerage have also returned to normal operation. The rest have not yet resumed operations due to unsound organization or excessive dependence on foreign countries.

　　沪市报关行业大部恢复营业
    【本报讯】随着内外物资交流的显著进展，沪市运输报关商行纷纷复业。据统计上海全市共有运输报关商行三百五十余家，九月份以后，因业务逐渐扩展，已有一百七十家运输兼报关商行（主要做陆运）全部恢复营业，专做报关业务的亦有一百二十家左右恢复了正常状态。其余则因组织不健全或对外依赖性太大尚未复业。
