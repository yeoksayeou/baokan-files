　　【Beijing News】He Xiangning, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, delivered a speech at Premier Zhou Enlai's banquet in honor of delegates from various countries to the Asian Women's Conference. The full text is as follows:
　　I feel honored to be able to participate in such a conference of global significance. I sincerely congratulate the success of the conference and wish all the delegates good health.
　　Chinese women have achieved liberation in the entire victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution. After nearly sixty years of arduous struggle, the Chinese people have realized the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the overthrow of the warlords, and finally, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and with the concerted efforts of all democratic classes and all democratic parties, they have completed the elimination of imperialist forces in China, fundamentally eliminated the Kuomintang reactionary regime of imperialist pawns, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and achieved the brilliant victory of the New Democratic Revolution. The root cause of the Chinese revolution's achievement of such a great victory is the influence of the Soviet October Revolution, the Soviet Union's enthusiastic assistance to the Chinese people's anti-imperialist struggle, and the continuous assistance from 1924 to today, which makes the people of our country extremely grateful to the Soviet Union for defeating German-Italian fascism in the West and defeating Japan in the East. We are inseparable from the Soviet Union and the people of New Democracy. Today, at the Asian Women's Conference, we victorious Chinese women should first of all thank the Soviet people, Soviet women, and their great leader Stalin, because their victory laid the foundation for our victory today.
　　I want to thank the women representatives from Mongolia and North Korea, who are advancing victoriously in the East. Because your victorious struggles are also a factor in promoting the victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution.
　　I also extend my gratitude to the representatives from the capitalist world and the colonial countries who are fighting for national liberation. Because your struggles have achieved the goal of weakening and containing imperialism, which has helped the victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution. The victory of the liberation of Chinese women is inseparable from your arduous struggles.
　　We firmly believe that under the leadership of the International Democratic Women's Federation, and after the success of our All-Asian Women's Conference, our women will surely make greater progress and achieve greater gains in the common cause of defending the fruits of victory and striving for liberation and victory.
　　What is our task?
　　I think the center of our task is to defend peace and consolidate lasting peace. Only by realizing this central task, completely defeating the warmongers and imperialist schemers, and firmly maintaining lasting peace, can our Soviet Union complete its great construction, our New Democratic China transform its backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, Mongolia and North Korea smoothly complete their construction programs, and women from all countries fighting for peace avoid war attacks and defeat all attempts by imperialism to launch more brutal attacks on the people under war mobilization.
　　I think we will definitely be able to achieve this goal. Because the strength of the world's democratic camp is growing day by day, while the imperialist camp is weakening day by day. The founding of the People's Republic of China and the founding of the German Democratic Republic have increased the proportion of the world's people's strength. We are bound to win, and we should consolidate this confidence in victory!
　　I firmly believe that our conference will be able to fulfill its historical mission.
　　Women of the world unite!
　　Democratic women of Asia unite!
　　Long live the Asian Women's Conference!

　　周总理欢宴亚洲妇代会各国代表会上
    中华民主妇联名誉主席何香凝演说全文
    【北京讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会名誉主席何香凝在周恩来总理欢宴亚洲妇女代表会议各国代表的宴会上发表演说，全文如下：
    我能够参加这样具有世界性意义的大会感觉到很光荣。我诚恳地祝贺大会的成功，和各位代表同志们的健康。
    中国妇女在中国人民大革命的整个胜利当中，得到了胜利的解放。中国人民经过了将近六十年很艰难的斗争，才实现了推翻满清，打倒军阀，和最后在毛主席和中国共产党的领导、各民主阶层，各民主党派的通力合作之下，完成了肃清帝国主义在中国的势力，根本消灭了帝国主义走狗封建主义和官僚资本主义的国民党反动政权，取得了新民主主义革命的光辉胜利。中国革命的取得这样伟大的胜利，其根源是和苏联十月革命的影响，苏联对中国人民的反帝国主义斗争的热诚援助，由一千九百二十四年起到今天不断的援助使我们全国的人民万分感谢苏联在西方打倒了德意法西斯蒂，在东方打倒了日本，我们和苏联及新民主主义的人民分不开的。今天，在亚洲妇女代表会议席上，我们胜利了的中国妇女，首先应该感谢苏联人民，苏联妇女和她们伟大的领袖斯大林，因为她们的胜利，就是为了我们今天的胜利打下基础的。
    我要感谢在东方胜利地前进着的蒙古，北朝鲜的妇女代表同志们。因为你们的胜利的斗争，也就是推动我们中国人民大革命胜利的一个因素。
    我也同时向资本主义世界，和正在为民族解放而斗争的殖民地国家的代表同志致感谢。因为你们的斗争，达到了削弱和牵制帝国主义的目的，这就帮助了中国人民大革命的胜利。中国妇女的解放胜利是和你们的艰苦斗争分不开的。
    我们坚决相信，在国际民主妇联的领导下，在我们全亚洲妇女代表会议的成功以后，我们妇女为着保持胜利果实，为着争取解放胜利的共同事业，将必有更大的进展，得更大的收获。
    我们的任务是什么呢？
    我想，我们任务的中心，就是为保卫和平，巩固持久的和平。只有实现这一中心任务，使得战争贩子们，和帝国主义的阴谋家们彻底失败，巩固地保持着持久和平，我们的苏联才能完成伟大的建设，我们的新民主主义中国才能使落后的农业国变成先进的工业国，蒙古和朝鲜才能顺利地完成它的建设程序，为和平而斗争的各国妇女才能避免战争的袭击，和击败帝国主义在战争动员之下，向人民更凶残进攻的一切企图。
    我想，我们一定能够实现这一目的。因为世界民主阵营的力量在一天天增涨，而帝国主义阵营则一天天削弱。中华人民共和国的成立，德意志人民共和国的成立，就增加了世界人民力量的比重，我们是一定胜利的，我们应该巩固这一胜利信心！
    我坚决相信我们这大会一定能够完成它的历史使命。
    全世界民主妇女团结起来！
    全亚洲民主妇女团结起来！
    亚洲妇女代表会议万岁！
