[Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] According to TASS reports: The Security Council held discussions on the Indonesian question from December 2nd to 14th. Representatives of colonial countries—the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, etc.—praised the so-called "United Nations Commission for Indonesia" report and the resolutions passed at the Hague "Round Table Conference."

　　The representative of the Ukrainian Republic, Mr. Galagan, stated in his speech on the 12th that the imperialist policies pursued by the United States and Britain in Indonesia violated the highest purpose and tasks of the United Nations Charter. Instead of allowing the Indonesian people to obtain the independence and self-determination stipulated in the Charter, the United States and Britain attempted to enslave the Indonesian people again and restore the old colonial order in Indonesia. The "United Nations Commission for Indonesia's" report on the work of the Hague "Round Table Conference" and the agreements signed at this conference fully demonstrate this point. The "United Nations Commission for Indonesia" has been turned by the United States into a tool to cover up the Dutch aggression in Indonesia. The Renville Agreement and the Hague Agreement, concluded under the pressure of this commission, fully expose it as a tool of the US policy towards Indonesia.

　　Mr. Galagan then put forward Ukraine’s proposal on the Indonesian issue, namely: (1) Dutch troops should first withdraw to the positions occupied before the military action of December 19, 1948; (2) The Dutch government should release political prisoners and end the terror against the Indonesian people; (3) The United Nations Commission must include representatives of all member states of the Security Council and be responsible for supervising the implementation of the above provisions; (4) Authorize the commission to draft recommendations on adjusting the conflict between the Netherlands and Indonesia within the next three months and submit them to the Security Council. These recommendations must be based on the principle of recognizing the independence and autonomy of the Indonesian people; (5) Abolish the "United Nations Commission for Indonesia."

　　During the discussion, the US-British colonial countries and their followers did their best to oppose the correct proposal of the Ukrainian representative. They endorsed the Canadian proposal, namely that the Security Council should pass a resolution expressing praise for both parties at the Hague Conference.

　　The Soviet representative, Mr. Tsarapkin, supported the Ukrainian representative’s proposal in his speech and strongly condemned the Hague Agreement as a shameful page in the activities of the United Nations.

　　The US-British bloc's majority in the Security Council did not offer any arguments to defend their position and rejected the proposal of the Ukrainian delegation. However, the Canadian proposal was also rejected because the Soviet representative, a permanent member of the Security Council, and the representative of the Ukrainian Republic both voted against it.

　　联合国安理会讨论印尼问题
    乌克兰反对海牙协议
    苏联否决美英集团无耻提案
    【本报讯】据新华社电综合塔斯社消息：安理会于十二月古二日至十四日举行关于印尼问题的讨论。殖民国家——美国、英国、法国、比利时等国的代表在会上赞扬所谓“联合国印尼委员会”的报告以及海牙“圆桌会议”通过的决议。
    乌克兰共和国代表加拉干十二日在会上发言，指出美国与英国对印尼所奉行的帝国主义政策，违背联合国宪章最高的目的和任务。美国和英国不但不让印尼人民获得宪章中所规定的独立与自决，反而企图再次奴役印尼人民，恢复在印尼的旧殖民地秩序。“联合国印尼委员会”关于海牙“圆桌会议”的工作报告和这个会议上所签订的各项协定，正表明了这点。“联合国印尼委员会”已被美国变为掩饰荷兰在印尼侵略行动的工具。在这个委员会压迫之下缔结的伦维尔协定和海牙协议，充分地暴露了它是美国对印尼政策的工具。
    加拉干继即提出乌克兰对印尼问题的提案，即：（一）荷兰军队应首先撤至一九四八年十二月十九日军事行动以前所占领的阵地；（二）荷兰政府应释放政治犯，并终止对印尼人民的恐怖行为；（三）联合国委员会必须包括安理会各理事国的代表，负责监督执行上述条款；（四）授权委员会在今后三个月内草拟关于调整荷兰、印尼间冲突的建议，并提交安理会，这种建议须以承认印尼人民独立和自主权利为原则；（五）取消“联合国印尼委员会”。
    在讨论中，美英殖民国家及其追随者竭力反对乌克兰代表的正确提案，他们赞成加拿大的提案，即由安理会通过对海牙会议双方表示赞扬的决议。
    苏联代表查拉普金在发言中支持乌克兰代表的提案，并痛斥海牙协议是联合国活动中可耻的一页。
    安理会中美英集团的多数，没有提出任何论据来辩解他们的立场，就否决了乌克兰代表团的提案。但是，加拿大的提案也被否决，因为安理会中的常任理事苏联代表以及乌克兰共和国的代表都投票反对。
