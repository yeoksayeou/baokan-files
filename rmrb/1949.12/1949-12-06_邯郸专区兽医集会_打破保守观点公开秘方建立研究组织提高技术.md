　　Handan Special District Veterinary Meeting
　　Breaking Conservative Views, Publicizing Secret Formulas, Establishing Research Organizations, and Improving Technology
　　[Hebei News] The Handan Prefectural Office convened a symposium of veterinarians from the entire district from November 10th to 15th. More than 40 veterinarians participated and studied the conditions and causes of livestock diseases in various counties. Deputy Commissioner Shi Huixuan encouraged everyone to serve the people and assist the government in doing a good job in the production movement. At the meeting, the veterinarians from various counties first discussed the epidemic situation of livestock this year and analyzed the causes of livestock epidemics as: (1) Farmers do not pay attention to hygiene when feeding livestock. (2) After livestock get sick, veterinarians did not treat them in time, resulting in the death of many livestock. This year, Handan had 665 livestock deaths due to animal epidemics (mostly jaundice). In Cixian County, 170 livestock died in the eighth and ninth districts alone. Guantao and Feixiang were lighter, but still had 460 deaths, causing considerable losses to the people, and greatly affected this year's tasks of sowing, autumn plowing, and watering. Although the four counties vigorously supported the breeding of more than 1,190 young livestock, the young livestock were not strong enough, and the number of deaths still exceeded the number of breeding by more than 100, which could not meet the production needs of farmers. After inspection, research and discussion, the veterinarians of each county fully realized that their own passive conservatism was the loss of the people, and felt the warm reception at the government meetings. They initially broke the conservative view of ancestral secret formulas that existed in the old society, and began to clarify the idea of serving the people. As a result, they volunteered to contribute secret formulas and exchanged experiences with each other, expressing their determination to resolutely protect the people's draft animals in the future. A total of 201 prescriptions were collected at the meeting, which can cure 39 kinds of livestock diseases. In the future, in order to further conduct regular research and improve technology, under the specific assistance of the Prefectural Office, the veterinarians established the Special District Veterinary Research Association, and elected Liu Yi and other seven people to serve as directors and members. The meeting also decided that after the veterinarians from each county returned to the county, they should quickly organize county-level veterinary research associations, take charge of protecting livestock in separate areas, and ensure the victorious completion of the future mass production movement. After the meeting, the veterinarians from each county returned to their counties extremely excited and happy to start livestock treatment work.

　　邯郸专区兽医集会
  　打破保守观点公开秘方建立研究组织提高技术
    【河北讯】邯郸专署于十一月十日至十五日，召开全区兽医座谈会。参加有兽医四十余人，研究了各县牲畜病的情况及原因。石蕙轩副专员勉励大家要为人民服务，协助政府把生产运动作好。会议上各县兽医首先交谈今年牲畜疫症情况，分析了畜疫发生的原因是：（一）农民喂牲口不注意卫生。（二）牲畜得病后，兽医没有及时治疗，致使牲畜死了很多。邯郸今年因兽疫（黄症较多）死亡牲口达六百六十五头，磁县八、九两个区即死掉一百七十余头，馆陶、肥乡较轻，也死掉四百六十头，使人民受到不少损失，对今年播种、秋耕、浇水的任务影响很大。虽然该四县大力扶持繁殖幼畜达一千一百九十余头，但因牲口小不顶用，而死亡与繁殖数目仍相差一百余头，不能满足农民生产需要。各县兽医经过检查研究与讨论，充分认识了自己消极保守，就是人民的损失，又感到政府会议中的热心招待，初步打破存在着旧社会祖传秘方的保守观点，开始明确了为人民服务的思想。因之纷纷自献秘方，互相交流经验，表示今后坚决保护人民耕畜。在会上共汇集了药方二百零一个，能治三十九种牲口病症。今后为更进一步经常研究提高技术，各兽医在专署具体帮助下建立了专区兽医研究会，选出刘义等七人分任主任及委员。会上又决定各县兽医回县后，迅速组织县级兽医研究会，分片负责进行保护牲畜工作，保证今后大生产运动的胜利完成。会后各县兽医均极兴奋愉快的回县着手进行牲畜治疗工作。
