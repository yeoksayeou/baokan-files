Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 21st. The Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government today issued instructions on carrying out mass propaganda work and literary and art work during the New Year and Spring Festival. The full text is as follows:

The New Year of 1950 is the first New Year after the founding of the People's Republic of China. As the People's Liberation Army has achieved a basic victory throughout the country and is wiping out the remaining bandits, most of China has begun to shift to peaceful construction. The people of the whole country will celebrate the New Year and Spring Festival of 1950 with unprecedented joy. In order to use this opportunity to carry out mass literary and art activities, to conduct propaganda and education work for the people, and to conduct condolences and celebrations for the People's Liberation Army and the families of soldiers, the culture and education departments of the people's governments at all levels should immediately carry out preparatory work in accordance with the following instructions, in coordination with mass organizations, literary and art organizations, organs, troops, and schools.

　　　　Pay Attention to Six Points of Propaganda Content

(1) The content of the New Year and Spring Festival propaganda in 1950 should focus on the following points:

1.  Publicize the great victory of the People's Liberation Army, publicize the establishment of the Central People's Government, publicize the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, publicize the wise leadership of Communism and Chairman Mao, and publicize the glory of the People's Liberation Army and the glory of combat heroes, families of soldiers, and families of martyrs.

2.  Publicize carrying the revolutionary war through to the end, publicize supporting the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet. Publicize paying agricultural taxes, paying commercial taxes, and purchasing People's Victory Treasury Bonds. Publicize unity, hard work, and overcoming difficulties in victory.

3.  Publicize the restoration and development of production, publicize the great achievements of workers and peasants in production and construction, and publicize the labor heroes of various production departments.

4.  According to local conditions, publicize the struggle against local tyrants, anti-special agents, elimination of bandits, and rent reduction and interest rate reduction in the new areas.

5.  Publicize internationalism, publicize Sino-Soviet friendship, and expose the crimes and conspiracies of American imperialism in its aggression against China.

6.  Publicize the new morality of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and loving public property. Publicize literacy and hygiene, and oppose superstition and backward thinking.

　　　　Propaganda Should Promote New Yangko Dance

(2) In terms of propaganda methods, lectures, entertainment parties, celebrations, and condolences can be adopted, and should be decided according to different regions, different situations, and different objects. During the Spring Festival, local people's governments and people's organizations should organize condolences and celebrations for local troops and the families of soldiers and martyrs, focusing on praising the merits and discipline of the army, reviewing and strengthening assistance to the difficulties of the army, families of soldiers, and families of martyrs. Condolences and celebrations should take into account local finances and the burden on the people, and avoid extravagance and waste. The army should carry out propaganda to support the government and cherish the people, and can also carry out celebrations with local residents, organs, groups, schools, and factories. Similarly, in addition to mutual celebrations, various organs, groups, schools, and factories should also celebrate with nearby residents. New Year and Spring Festival art activities can take various forms according to the situation, such as movies, dramas, songs, Yangko dance, drums, clappers, shadow plays, and various other acrobatics. New Yangko dance is a most popular and mass artistic form, which should continue to be promoted and improved; at the same time, various original artistic forms familiar to the local people should be widely used and transformed. For various old artists and old art organizations (such as rural amateur opera troupes, old theaters in cities, various entertainment venues, etc.), they should also be encouraged to use their inherent artistic forms to promote new content and actively participate in the New Year and Spring Festival activities. In all art activities, attention should be paid to showing the new undertakings and new characters of New China, and showing the vigorous atmosphere of the founding of the country.

　　　　Prepare Materials to Supply the Masses

(3) Local literary and art work groups and literary and art workers should actively prepare various materials, such as short scripts, lyrics, songs, New Year pictures, Spring Festival couplets, etc., for the masses to use, and should assign cadres to rural areas, factories, and troops to help the masses carry out creation and performance activities. Where possible, literary and art work teams or film and slide projection teams should be organized to conduct mobile performances or screenings in rural areas and factories. However, all activities must pay attention to not hindering production, not hindering work, not violating frugality, and strive to cooperate with the political and cultural learning of the masses (such as winter schools in rural areas, study classes in factories, military training in troops, etc.). After the Spring Festival, attention should be paid to summarizing the experience of mass literary and art activities.
