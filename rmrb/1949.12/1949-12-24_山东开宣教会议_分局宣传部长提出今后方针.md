Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th -- The Shandong Branch Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a propaganda and education meeting in Jinan from November 17th to 26th. Attendees included propaganda ministers from the Lunan, Jiaodong, and Bohai District Party Committees and their affiliated prefectural party committees, propaganda ministers from the Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Zibo, and Weifang Municipal Party Committees, and the Changwei Directly Subordinate Prefectural Committee, as well as Party member cadres from other major propaganda and education departments, totaling over 100 people. The attendees reported on their work and offered suggestions. Peng Kang, the Propaganda Minister of the Branch Bureau, gave a summary report, and Fu Qiutao, the Deputy Secretary of the Branch Bureau, delivered a speech.

Peng Kang's summary report first pointed out that the propaganda and education work had achieved considerable results in the past six months. For example, in the battles to liberate Qingdao, Changshan Island, and eliminate the remaining enemy forces in Shandong, propaganda work played a powerful supporting role. Policy and discipline education were conducted in advance, and workers and peasants were mobilized to restore transportation and join the army to go south. In flood control work, propaganda mobilized hundreds of thousands of people to participate in flood control, saving Shandong from the Yellow River floods. In production, the slogans "Add one more cart of manure, hoe one more time, and harvest 10% more grain" were widely promoted, and timely drought and flood prevention propaganda was carried out. In the cities, propaganda about policies in all directions was carried out, which raised the consciousness and enthusiasm of the working class for production and also dispelled the concerns of industrialists and businessmen about developing production. In addition, education on internationalism, the people's democratic dictatorship, and opposition to disorganization and lack of discipline was carried out among the vast number of cadres. Peng Kang then pointed out some shortcomings in the propaganda and education work: for example, education on internationalism and the people's democratic united front was not conducted sufficiently; there were more temporary and concentrated mass propaganda mobilizations and fewer regular, meticulous, and systematic political propaganda and education. The organization of propaganda and education departments was not yet sound, and the phenomena of disorganization and lack of discipline in propaganda and education work had not been well overcome. Leaders had also failed to conduct timely work inspections and summaries.

After analyzing the current situation in Shandong, Peng Kang proposed that Shandong should focus on the following aspects in its future propaganda and education work: (1) Conduct widespread and in-depth education on the people's democratic dictatorship, the people's democratic united front, and internationalism. (2) Regarding the relationship between urban and rural areas, promote mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, the idea that cities serve rural areas, and that rural areas support cities, and establish the idea of a worker-peasant alliance. (3) Educate cadres and Party members to strengthen their national concept, overall concept, and a high sense of responsibility to the people of the whole country. Based on the above guidelines, propaganda and education work should be carried out regularly and systematically in the future, organizations should be strengthened, propaganda and education committees should be established, the discipline of propaganda and education work should be strengthened, and the system of requesting instructions and reporting should be implemented.

Fu Qiutao, Deputy Secretary of the Shandong Branch Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, emphasized in his speech that the cultural and theoretical education of cadres is a serious task for the Shandong Party in the future. Only by improving cultural and theoretical levels and mastering Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can we correctly grasp the Party's policies and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Without a certain level of cultural and theoretical knowledge, we cannot correctly implement the Party's policies, which will harm the interests of the people.

　　山东开宣教会议
    分局宣传部长提出今后方针
    【新华社济南二十日电】中共中央山东分局十一月十七日到二十六日在济南召开宣传教育会议，到会有鲁中南、胶东、渤海三个区党委和所属地委宣传部长，济南、青岛、徐州、淄博、潍坊五个市委和昌潍直属地委的宣传部长，和其他主要宣传教育部门中的党员干部，共一百多人。与会者分别汇报工作情况并提出工作意见，分局宣传部长彭康作总结性报告，分局副书记傅秋涛作了讲话。
    彭康的总结性报告首先指出了半年来宣传教育工作得到了不少成绩，如在解放青岛、长山岛、消灭山东境内残余敌人的战役中，宣教工作起了有力的配合作用，事前进行了政策和纪律教育，随后又动员工人、农民，恢复交通，参军南下。在防汛工作中，宣传动员了几十万人民参加防汛，使山东得免黄河水患。在生产中广泛宣传“多上一车粪、多锄一遍地、多打一成粮”的口号，并及时进行防旱防涝宣传。在城市进行了四面八方的政策的宣传，提高了工人阶级的觉悟和积极生产情绪，也打破了工商业者对发展生产的顾虑。此外更在广大干部中进行了关于国际主义、人民民主专政，反对无组织无纪律的教育。彭康接着也指出了宣教工作中存在的一些缺点：如国际主义和人民民主统一战线教育进行得不够，临时的突击的群众宣传鼓动多，而经常的、细致的、有系统的政治宣传教育少。宣教部门的机构还不够健全，宣传教育工作中的无组织无纪律现象未能很好克服，领导上也没有能及时进行工作的检查和总结。
    彭康在分析山东当前形势后，提出今后山东在宣教工作方面应当：（一）广泛地深入地进行人民民主专政和人民民主统一战线教育及国际主义教育。（二）对城乡关系，应宣传城乡互助，城市为农村服务，农村支持城市的道理，树立工农联盟的思想。（三）教育干部和党员加强国家观念、整体观念和对全国人民的高度责任心。根据以上方针，今后要经常有计划地进行宣传教育工作，健全机构，建立宣传教育委员会，加强宣传教育工作的纪律性，贯彻执行请示报告制度。
    中共中央山东分局副书记傅秋涛在讲话中，强调指出干部的文化教育和理论教育是山东党今后的严重任务。只有提高文化水平和理论水平，掌握马列主义和毛泽东思想才能正确掌握党的政策和人民政协共同纲领。没有一定的文化理论水平，就不能正确执行党的政策，就将使人民利益受到损害。
