　　U.S. Imperialism Promotes the Establishment of West German Army
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th. Combined TASS reports: U.S. imperialism is vigorously promoting the establishment of a West German army to serve as pawns in the aggression against the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies. According to a New York Worker's Daily reporter, Bradley, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and a war peddler, declared at a secret gathering of reporters: "From a military point of view, the establishment of a West German army is desirable." The reporter continued: The Washington Observer speculates that West Germany will first establish a "domestic security force" as a police force, and then expand it into an army. In a recent "Congressional Record Special Issue" published by the U.S. Congress, Representative Bowge, a true representative of Wall Street tycoons and a war peddler, even suggested that the United States organize twenty-five divisions of German mercenaries, whose senior officers should be filled by Americans. He shamelessly declared: "German mercenaries can be bought cheaply, and it is enough to pay German mercenaries only a small portion of the salary paid to the U.S. military." Daller, who served as a legal advisor to the U.S. prosecutor in the Nuremberg war crimes trials, also openly declared at a gathering of lawyers in New York: The rearmament of West Germany and the establishment of a new modern German army will be the main topic in all future political discussions. He also said that the "defense" of Western Europe would be impossible without the help of German soldiers. At the same time, news from Washington continues to quote remarks predicting "five divisions of German troops within a year." The United Press London reporter also stated that authoritative sources admit that Western military strategists are very concerned about the "possibility of the German army pushing the front line of the Atlantic Treaty to the Elbe River in the future."

The latest news report published a special article by Slavin, commenting on Bradley and Bowge's crazy plan to establish mercenaries in West Germany with dollars. The author pointed out that, like a gang of robbers, the war-mongering gang also has experts in various fields. For example, John Dulles is a former master spy, and his brother, Swafford Dulles, incites war hysteria. Bradley specializes in making murder plans for aggressive wars, and Churchill has a hand in everything. Representative Bowge has discovered a new object for American investment: German blood, and invented a new profitable business, buying mercenaries in Germany at low prices. He suggested sending "cheap Germans" to the slaughterhouse instead of "expensive Americans." The author further pointed out that Bowge's suggestion is not new, and the American aggressors have long planned to establish mercenary armies for them to drive and achieve their goals of conquest. At the same time, he avoids talking about atomic weapons, because the atomic monster in the hands of those who instigate war hysteria has recently been defeated.

  　美帝促建西德军队
    【新华社北京二十九日电】综合塔斯社消息：美帝国主义正力促建立西德军队，充当进攻苏联和东欧人民民主国家的走卒。据纽约工人日报记者称，美联合参谋部主席、战贩布莱德雷曾在一群记者秘密集会上宣称：“从军事的观点看来，建立西德陆军是可取的”。该记者继称：华盛顿观察家揣测西德将首先建立“国内保安队”作为警察队，然后再扩编为军队。在美国国会最近发表的“国会记录特刊”中，华尔街大亨的真正代表和战贩、众议员鲍治，更建议美国组织二十五个师的德国雇佣军，其高级军官应由美人充任。他并无耻地宣称：“德国的雇佣兵是可以廉价买到的，可以用只相当于发给美国军队的薪饷的一小部分，来报酬德国的雇佣军就够了。”曾充任审讯纽伦堡战犯美检察官的法律顾问的戴勒，在纽约一群律师集会上也公然宣称：西德重整军备和建立新的近代化德军，将为一切未来政治讨论中的主要议题。他并说西欧的“防御”假如没有德国士兵之助，将是不可能的。同时，华盛顿方面来的消息，仍继续引用预言“一年之内，德国有五师兵”的言论。合众社伦敦记者亦称，权威人士承认，西方军事战备家对“将来由德国陆军把大西洋公约的前线推到易北河的可能性”，甚表关怀。
    最近消息报上刊载斯拉文所著的专文，评论布莱德雷与鲍治以美元在西德建立雇佣军的这种疯狂计划。作者指出，好象强盗匪帮一样，战争贩子帮里也有各方面的专家。例如，约翰·杜勒斯是过去的间谍大行家，他的兄弟斯福特·杜勒斯则鼓动战争歇斯底里。布莱德雷则是专门制造侵略战争的杀人计划，邱吉尔则是什么事情都有他一份的。众议员鲍治则发现了美国投资的新对象：德国人的血，发明了利润优厚的新事业，以低价在德国收买雇佣兵。他建议将“廉价的德国人”送上屠场，而不用“费钱的美国人”。作者进一步指出，鲍治的建议并不是新的，美国的侵略者们早已计划成立雇佣军队，供他们驱使以达到征服的目的。同时，他避而不谈原子武器，这是因为鼓动战争歇斯底里的人手中的原子妖怪，最近已经被打倒了。
