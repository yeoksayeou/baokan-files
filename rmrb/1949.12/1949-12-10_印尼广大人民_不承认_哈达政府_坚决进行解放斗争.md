　　The broad masses of the Indonesian people
  　Do Not Recognize the "Hatta Government"
  　Resolutely Carry Out the Liberation Struggle
    However, the Indonesian people did not kneel before the foreign aggressors; they continued to carry out the liberation struggle under difficult conditions. The Dutch government insisted that the so-called Hatta government represents the Republic of Indonesia; this assertion does not conform to the facts. Even units within the Republic Army are disobeying Hatta's orders and joining the Indonesian People's Resistance Army en masse, which is a clear proof of this.
    The broad democratic strata of Indonesia, like the resistance forces, neither recognize the so-called Hatta government nor the "Round Table Conference" and its decisions. The declaration of the resistance forces (signed by Hayono, the leader of the patriotic movement in central and eastern Java) stated that the Indonesian people will not recognize the decisions of the "Round Table Conference" because it restricts the power of the Republic of Indonesia. The declaration also demanded the release of political prisoners. According to reports from the Indonesian News Agency, there are 70,000 political prisoners imprisoned in Java and Sumatra alone.
    All news from Indonesia indicates that neither the so-called Hatta government nor the Netherlands can control the situation in Indonesia, despite their occupation of many cities.
    Therefore, if the proposal of the US-British bloc is passed, it will mean that the committee approves the decisions of the Hague "Round Table Conference," which the Indonesian people firmly oppose.
    The Ukrainian Republic delegation is well aware of these decisions and therefore declares with full responsibility that the secret agreements concluded in The Hague between the Dutch aggressors and the Hatta group deprive the Indonesian people of the autonomous right to establish their own independent state, the right to dispose of their country's economic resources, and the right to establish independent diplomatic and trade relations with other countries.

### 印尼广大人民　不承认“哈达政府”　坚决进行解放斗争

　　印尼广大人民
  　不承认“哈达政府”
  　坚决进行解放斗争
    但是，印尼人民并没有在外国侵略者的面前屈膝，他们在困难的条件下继续进行解放斗争。荷兰政府硬说所谓哈达政府代表印尼共和国，这种断言并不符合事实。连共和国陆军中的部队，都不服从哈达的命令而整批地加入印尼人民的抵抗军，这就是一个明证。
    印尼广大的民主阶层，也和抵抗部队一样，既不承认所谓哈达政府，也不承认“圆桌会议”和它的决定。抵抗部队的宣言（由爪哇中部与东部爱国运动的领袖哈约诺签字）说：印尼人民不会承认“圆桌会议”的决定，因为它限制了印尼共和国的权力。宣言并要求释放政治犯。根据印尼通讯社的报道，仅在爪哇与苏门答腊两地，就有七万政治犯被监禁中。
    来自印尼的一切消息都说明，无论所谓哈达政府或荷兰，都不能掌握印尼的形势，尽管他们占有印尼的许多城市。
    因此，如果通过了美英集团这一提案，那将意味着委员会批准印尼人民所坚决反对的海牙“圆桌会议”的决定。
    乌克兰共和国代表团深知这些决定，因而充分负责任地宣告：荷兰侵略者与哈达集团在海牙成立的秘密协议，剥夺了印尼人民建立他们自己的独立国家的自主权利，剥夺了他们处理他们国家的经济资源，以及与其他国家建立独立外交和贸易关系的权利。
