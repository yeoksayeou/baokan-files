　　Record of Unloading Overweight Rocks
　　Fengtai Station Chen Xueliang
　　On the night of December 22nd, a string of seven cars was parked in front of the Transport Office building at Fengtai Station. They were loaded with large stones for engineering construction being transported from Nankou Station to Xingang Station.

　　Because Nankou Station did not have a weighbridge, they had to come to Fengtai to be weighed. After weighing, it was discovered that two of the cars were overloaded, exceeding the limit by more than six tons in total.

　　Too much weight would damage the undercarriage of the cars, so it was necessary to unload some of the stones. Under normal circumstances, these two cars would have to be shunted to the freight yard and unloaded by the loading and unloading team.

　　But there was no time for that now. Shunting to the freight yard and unloading would interfere with catching the 5:15 train to Tianjin, which would make it impossible to fulfill the superior's call for "punctual train operation." If we left them off without attaching them, we would have to wait for the next train at 11:00, which would extend the "vehicle dwell time." Furthermore, waiting for the loading and unloading team to get here with their equipment would take more than half an hour, and it was already 4:10. We couldn't finish unloading in forty minutes, and everyone was anxious.

　　At this moment, Qiao Zhanxi of the rolling stock inspection section called on everyone, saying, "Being anxious won't solve the problem. Can't we just put in some effort and unload it ourselves?" In response to his call, everyone sprang into action. Ban Runju also called on the transport personnel upstairs.

　　At the same time, Cheng Jianhai, who was in charge of weighing the goods, also notified the loading and unloading team.

　　It was especially cold as dawn approached, and the northwest wind was howling. Each large stone on the cars weighed about seventy or eighty pounds, and there were no gangplanks between the cars. However, the transport members Hu Jinquan, Pang Wenxun, and Chen Xueliang, the veteran worker Li Yunhe, and the eight people from the rolling stock inspection section all pitched in together, lifting the large stones one by one. After thirty minutes, the loading and unloading team arrived, but we had already successfully completed the task of unloading the overweight stones.

　　After getting off the cars, the dozen or so people were panting, their hands and bodies covered in dirt. Ten minutes later, the two cars were safely coupled to the train, and at 5:08, with a "whoosh," it left the station. People watched the rolling wheels and the engine's smoke soaring into the sky, and they smiled happily and victoriously.

　　Twenty-fifth, Fengtai

　　倒装大石记
    丰台车站  陈学梁
    在十二月二十二日的夜里，丰台站运输室的大楼前，一连串停着七辆车皮。上面载着由南口站运往新港站的工程建筑用的大石。
    因为南口站没有地磅，所以必须到丰台来过磅。在过完磅以后，发现有两辆车皮装载逾重，一共超过了六吨多。
    装多了，车底受不了，所以必须要倒装。要是在平时，就必须把这两辆车甩到货场，由装卸队去倒装。
    可是现在那么办可等不了。因为甩到货场去倒，还要赶着挂五点一刻去天津的列车，这样便完成不了上级的号召：“列车正点运行运动”。你说甩下不挂吧，就得等十一点开的下一趟车，那样一来又延长了“车辆停站时间”。再说是等装卸队拿着家伙赶到这儿来干，也得等半点多钟，现在已经四点十分了。四十分钟也倒不完，大家都在急焦着。
    这时侯，检车段的乔占锡号召大家说：“只是急，不解决问题，我们不会自己卖卖力气，自己倒它一下吗？”一声号召，大家都响应了，动了起来。班润举又号召了楼上运输的人员。
    在这时候，负责货物过磅的程建海也通知了装卸队。
    天快亮的时候，特别的冷，西北风飕飕的刮着，车上的每一块大石都在七、八十斤左右，两车之间又没有跳板。可是，运输的团员胡金全、庞文训、陈学梁，老工友李云和再加上检车段的八个人，一齐动手，把大石一块一块地搬了起来，三十分钟后，装卸队赶到了，可是我们倒装大石的任务，已胜利地完成了。
    十几个人下车后，气喘吁吁，满手满身是土。十分钟后，这两辆车皮已经安全的套上了列车，在五点零八分“呜”的一声开出站了。人们看着滚滚的车轮，看着机车的烟云冲天，都愉快胜利的笑了。
    二十五，丰台
