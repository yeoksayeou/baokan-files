　　Heilongjiang Provincial Trade Union Federation
    Formulates Next Year's Worker Education Plan
    Focusing on Cultural Education, Absorbing 20,000 Organized Workers to Participate in Learning.
    [This newspaper's Northeast News] The Heilongjiang Provincial Trade Union Federation recently formulated the 1950 worker cultural and educational work plan, which will raise the province's worker education work to a higher level. The plan stipulates: 1. The guiding principle of worker education is to focus on cultural education, with an emphasis on strengthening worker night schools. Mobilize 20,000 organized workers from public and private factories to enroll in schools, requiring them to improve their cultural level to the equivalent of two years of ordinary primary school within one year. 2. Systematically carry out class education and education on current events and policies, strengthen the working class's education in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and establish a revolutionary outlook on life. 3. Vigorously cultivate and promote worker cadres. The provincial trade union federation will hold a training class every one and a half months, with 70 people in each class. It is required to complete the training of all 208 trade union cadres in the province by May of next year. Each county must also hold a worker cadre training class every month, so that 3,600 trade union cadres can be trained by May of next year. 4. Organize worker technical learning groups on a factory-by-factory basis to improve workers' technical skills. 5. Carry out educational cultural and recreational activities, strengthen worker communication work, and encourage writing.
    [This newspaper's Northeast News] Worker education work in Heilongjiang Province is developing more and more actively. At present, there are 104 regular night schools in the province, absorbing 10,395 workers to participate in learning. The first worker training class opened by the Provincial Trade Union Federation to train worker cadres had 44 participants. Most counties have also opened training classes. Among the 63 amateur worker theater troupes that have been established in the province, there are 1,786 actors. In addition, the province has 50 factory clubs, 19 county worker clubs, 4 employee cinemas, and 1 employee theater.
