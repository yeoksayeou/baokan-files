    Support the Issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds!
　　Strive to Complete the Victory Bonds
    Zhang Bojun
    Regarding the two major bills decided upon by the Fourth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, namely: the 1950 National Revenue and Expenditure Budget and the issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds, I have the following thoughts: (1) These two bills were repeatedly discussed beforehand. After the Standing Committee of the National Committee and the Central Government Committee, as well as responsible leaders from various departments and regions, repeatedly exchanged opinions before the meeting, considered the actual situation, and then drafted the bills, they were submitted to the formal meeting and unanimously passed. Such a democratic style of discussing major national plans and a responsible attitude are not only unimaginable for the dictatorial Kuomintang government of the past, but even so-called bourgeois conferences cannot exhibit such a style. Their national budgets and bonds were only for the private benefit of a few privileged classes and were detrimental to the vast majority of the people. (2) Regarding the national budget and bonds themselves, after hearing Chairman Mao's principled explanation and the reports and explanations made by Comrades Chen, Bo, Li, Deng, and Rao, we are completely convinced that these two major decisions will inevitably be supported by the people of the whole country and faithfully implemented. I sincerely hope that all democratic parties and patriotic people should actively strive to complete these two tasks. (3) I believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved a series of great victories in the military, political, and diplomatic fields in 1949. Now, with the passage of these two major bills, we firmly believe that in 1950, we will inevitably achieve brilliant victories in overcoming financial difficulties, stabilizing prices, and stabilizing people's livelihoods. All our enemies, especially the American imperialists and war-mongers, will feel a more tragic defeat, and the forces of world democracy and peace will take a further step forward.

    拥护发行人民胜利折实公债！
　　为完成胜利公债而努力
    章伯钧
    关于中央人民政府委员会第四次会议所决定的两大法案，即：一九五○年度全国财政收支概算，和发行人民胜利折实公债，我有如后的感想：（一）这两个法案，是事先经过反复讨论的。经过全国委员会常务委员会和中央政府委员会，以及各部各地区负责首长，于会前迭次交换意见，斟酌实际，而后做成草案，交付正式会议而获得一致通过的；像这样讨论国家大计，民主作风，共同负责的态度，不仅是过去独裁的国民党政府所不能设想的，就是所谓资产阶级的会议，也不能表具这样的风格；他们关于国家预算和公债，只是为着少数特权阶级私益而斗争的，对于广大人民是不利的。（二）关于国家概算和公债的本身，我们在听到毛主席原则性的说明，和陈、薄、李、邓、饶诸负责同志所提出的报告及解释后，使我们完全相信这两项重大的决定，将必然地获得全国人民的拥护，与忠诚执行的效果。我深切的希望一切民主党派和爱国人士，应当踊跃争先地为完成这两项任务而努力。（三）我认为在毛主席领导下，一九四九年中国人民在军事、政治、外交各方面，一连串的获得了伟大的胜利，现在经过这两大法案的通过，我们万分相信在一九五○年，对于战胜财政困难、稳定物价和安定民生，又将必然地获得辉煌的胜利，我们一切的敌人特别是美帝国主义者和战争贩子，更要感到悲惨的失败，而世界民主和平的力量，将更要向前迈进一步。
