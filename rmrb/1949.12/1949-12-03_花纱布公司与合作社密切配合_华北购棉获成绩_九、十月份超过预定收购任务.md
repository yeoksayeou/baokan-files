　　Cotton Yarn Cloth Company Closely Cooperates with Cooperatives
  　North China Achieves Success in Cotton Procurement
    Exceeding Planned Procurement Targets in September and October
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the conclusion of the "North China Cotton Procurement and Purity Preservation Conference" in early September, significant progress has been made in the cotton procurement work in various provinces and counties. The planned procurement tasks for September and October have been completed and exceeded, cotton price policies have been correctly grasped, the interests of cotton farmers have been guaranteed, and the purity of improved varieties has been maintained. Furthermore, this cotton procurement has strengthened the relationship between cooperatives and state-owned enterprises, and promoted the development of cooperative business.
    In terms of organizing and allocating resources for this cotton procurement, the North China Cotton Yarn Cloth Company and the North China Cooperative Federation jointly formulated a "Cotton Procurement Agreement" (referred to as the "Cotton Procurement Agreement"). Based on cotton production conditions, "key cotton procurement areas" were selected. The company organized more than fifty cotton procurement teams to purchase in major cities, while the cooperatives focused on rural areas. From early October, the local branches of the Cotton Yarn Cloth Company and the local cooperatives collectively or individually signed cotton procurement contracts based on the "Agreement" and specific circumstances. By late October, more than two hundred contracts had been signed in over forty counties. Areas without contracts proceeded according to the principles of the "Cotton Procurement Agreement". With the close cooperation between the Cotton Yarn Cloth Company and the cooperatives, the planned procurement for September and October has been exceeded, driving more than three thousand cotton gins and ten thousand workers in rural areas to engage in cotton ginning and baling. Cotton ginning and baling teams and cooperatives were widely organized, developing rural sideline production.
    In terms of preserving the purity of improved varieties, through the organization and education of the cooperatives, the separation of improved varieties for collection, ginning, and storage was implemented, collecting excellent varieties for the future promotion of 1 million mu of Si Zi Cotton No. 2.
    Regarding the control of cotton price policies, when new cotton entered the market this year, the new price in Xinxiang was 750 yuan, equivalent to 5.12 jin of millet. Subsequently, the key cotton procurement areas actively increased the cotton-grain price ratio. Through the method of credit purchase, each jin of standard cotton (lint length 7/8 inch) should not be lower than 9 jin of millet, and those below the standard should be reduced accordingly, but not lower than 8 jin. By September, the average cotton price in the entire region had reached 9.02 jin, ensuring that each jin of cotton could be exchanged for 8 to 10 jin of millet, safeguarding the interests of cotton farmers and stimulating their enthusiasm for cotton planting, laying the foundation for expanding cotton fields next year.
    Through this cotton procurement, cooperative members in various places were given a 2% premium over the market price when they delivered cotton to the cooperatives, and they could also exchange for various daily necessities such as agricultural tools, fertilizers, market cloth, and kerosene, making the broad masses truly experience that entering a cooperative means selling agricultural products at higher than market prices and buying industrial products and other living materials at lower than market prices. Therefore, they are all actively forming and joining cooperatives. For example, in Yep County (newly established county) in Pingyuan Province, more than one thousand new members were developed in the key cotton procurement villages within half a month, and more than twenty cooperatives have been developed in Ding County, Hebei Province, since the cotton procurement began. Other areas such as Xinxiang Prefecture, Nangong, and Meng County have all developed cooperative organizations and strengthened the organizational awareness of members during the cotton procurement business.
    Currently, the issues that need special attention and must be resolved are: First, how to flexibly control the cotton-grain price ratio to achieve stable prices and protect the real interests of farmers. Due to individual areas implementing mechanical millet-for-cotton exchanges and paying large amounts of cash, resulting in a concentrated currency market, the skyrocketing price of rice drove up the prices of all commodities, and the competition between cotton and grain prices led to the vicious consequences of overall price fluctuations, which must be resolved quickly. Some areas' farmers do not really lack rice, and we should supply farmers with the means of production and daily necessities they need based on local actual needs. This will avoid stimulating rising grain prices and reduce the amount of currency in circulation. In areas with price fluctuations, the method of credit sales should be widely promoted, calling on farmers to sell cotton on credit to the public, converting it into real objects at the current price, and returning it when due. If farmers do not need grain and money at the moment, they can be given money or real objects at the then-current market price on a regular basis. In this way, it saves the real value of goods for farmers and completes the state's procurement tasks. This is beneficial to both the public and private sectors, and farmers can accept it.
    Second, some cooperatives and agency stores are pursuing profits and engaging in corruption, which urgently needs to be overcome. In addition, due to the inadequate prevalence of cooperative organizations and the limited number of cotton collection points, some farmers have to endure the pain of selling cotton to merchants in the market at low prices. The North China Cooperative Federation has therefore issued a "Supplementary Instructions on Cotton Procurement", calling on local cooperative cadres to seize the opportunity of cotton procurement, and vigorously organize and develop rural supply and marketing cooperatives in conjunction with the cotton procurement business. In order to combine winter production and disaster relief work, attention should also be paid to the organization and development of the cottonseed oil extraction industry. Prepare to establish oil extraction teams or cooperatives.

　　花纱布公司与合作社密切配合
  　华北购棉获成绩
    九、十月份超过预定收购任务
    【本报讯】九月初“华北收花保纯会议”闭幕后，各省县的收购棉花工作，已获得了很大成绩，完成并超过了九十两月份预定的收购任务，正确掌握了棉价政策，保证了棉农利益，进行了良种保纯。此外通过这次购棉，密切了合作社与国营企业的关系，并使合作社的业务获得发展。
    这次购棉在力量的组织配备方面，开始由华北花纱布公司和华北合作总社共同商订“收购棉花协议”（简称收棉协议）根据产棉情况择定“收棉重点”，公司方面组织了五十多个收花小组到各大城市收购，合作社则着重乡村。从十月上旬起，各地花纱布分支公司与各地合作社根据“协议”和具体情况集体或个别订立购棉合同，到十月下旬，已有四十余县订立了二百多个合同。其余未订合同的地区即依照“收棉协议”的原则进行。在花纱布公司与合作社的密切配合下，九、十两月份已超过预定的收购计划，并带动起农村三千多辆轧车万余名工人进行轧花与扎包，广泛组织了轧花和打包小组及合作社，发展了农村副业生产。
    在良种保纯方面，通过合作社的组织教育，实行了择良分收、分轧、分藏，收集优良品种，作为明年推广斯字棉二号一百万亩之用。
    掌握棉价政策方面，今年新花上市时，新乡的新价格为七五○元，合小米五斤十二两，嗣后经过各收棉重点主动提高棉粮比价，通过赊购办法，每斤标准棉（绒长八分之七英寸）不得低于小米九斤，不够标准者递减，但也不得低过八斤。到九月份全区棉价已达到平均九．○二斤，保证了每斤花交换八斤到十斤米的价格，卫护了棉农利益，刺激了农民植棉的积极性，奠下明年扩大棉田的基础。
    经过这次购棉，各地合作社员向合作社交花时，均给高于市价百分之二的优待，又能在合作社交换到农具、肥料、市布、煤油等各种日用品，使广大群众真正体验到入了合作社，即能高于市价出卖农产品，低于市价买到工业品及其他生活资料种种好处，所以都纷纷组社及入社；如平原省邺县（新设县）半月之中在收棉重点村建立合作社发展社员一千余人，河北定县收棉以来已发展了二十多处合作社。其他如新乡专区、南宫、孟县等地都在收棉业务中发展了合作社的组织，加强了社员的组织观念。
    目前需要特别注意和必须解决的问题是：一、如何灵活掌握棉、粮比价，以达到平稳物价、保障农民真正利益的目的。由于个别地区，施行机械的以米换棉并大批的支付现款，造成了贷币集中市场，米价暴涨带动百货，棉粮竞升，引起整个物价波动的恶果，必须迅速解决。有些地区农民并不真正缺米，应根据当地实际需要，供给农民需要的生产资料和日用必需品，这样既能避免刺激粮价上涨，又可减少货币流通量。在物价波动地区更应广泛推行赊售办法，号召农民把棉花赊给公家，按现价折成实物，到期归还。如农民目下不需要粮款，即可定期按当时市价给款或实物归还。这样，既替农民保存了实物价值，又完成了国家的收购任务。公私两利，农民们是能够接受的。
    二、还有部分合作社和代收店追逐利润，营私舞弊，这是急需克服的。此外由于合作组织尚不够普遍，及收棉点还太少，以致有的农民不得不忍痛拿棉花在市场低价卖给商贩，华北合作总社为此特发出“收棉补充指示”，号召各地合作干部，抓紧收棉时机，结合收棉业务，大力组织与发展农村供销社。为了结合冬季生产救灾工作，并应注意棉籽榨油业的组织与开展。准备成立榨油小组或合作社。
