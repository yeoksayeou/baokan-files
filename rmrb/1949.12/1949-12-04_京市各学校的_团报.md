"League Newspapers" of Various Schools in Beijing

The "League Newspapers" run by the Communist Youth League branches in various schools in Beijing are the most attractive to readers among the wall newspapers in the schools. Like the Youth League, they are loved and supported by the majority of students. Through them, they assist the schools in guiding learning, strengthen the relationship between the Youth League and the masses, and expand the ranks of the Youth League in the schools.

The League branches in various schools generally attach importance to the work of the League Newspapers. In order to improve the organizational structure of the League Newspapers and give full play to their role as a bridge between Youth League members and students, some League branches have equipped outstanding League members to form League Newspaper committees and absorbed some progressive students to participate. The responsible comrades of each branch and group are frequent contributors and correspondents, and they mobilize every League member and student to contribute, making the League Newspaper a common garden for all students. Most of the League Newspapers appear in the form of wall newspapers, which are eye-catching, attract attention, and transmit news quickly. Some schools, such as Jiaotong University Beijing Management College, North China University No. 2, and Municipal Girls' No. 1 Middle School, use mimeographed tabloids, so that each group can get a copy, which is more convenient for readers to refer to and save.

The League Newspapers that are well-run in various schools organize their content around the central task of unity and learning. They exchange learning experiences and methods, commend and criticize models and laggards in learning, fight against erroneous ideas, and encourage students' learning enthusiasm. During the New Democracy study movement launched in various schools this semester, many students still resisted ideologically, believing that seeking knowledge away from books was empty talk, and did not realize that only a learning method that combines books with practice is a powerful weapon to improve learning efficiency. In response to this problem, the League Newspapers took on the task of clearing up thinking and doing a good job in learning, carried out propaganda among the majority of students, established correct learning views, and laid an ideological foundation for the development of the movement. After some middle school Youth League tabloids published articles respecting teachers and loving students, the relationship between teachers and students has obviously been improved. The League Newspapers have directly and indirectly served learning.

The League Newspapers not only help the schools in their studies, but also play a role in promoting other movements. According to the central work of the Youth League in each period, they help students' ideological brewing and mobilization in advance, point out the correct direction in the progress of the movement, and correct deviations and shortcomings. For example, in the evaluation of people's scholarships, saving for disaster relief, and voluntary labor in various schools, the League Newspapers have played a powerful supporting role.

The League Newspapers have also fulfilled their responsibilities in improving students' political and ideological level and assisting in national construction. Since the summer vacation, students have undergone intensive political studies and are eager to understand the organizational life of the Youth League and the basic knowledge of the League. On the basis of this request from the students, the League Newspapers held a symposium on the work of the League Newspapers, so that students could put forward their opinions and requirements for the League Newspapers, humbly accept the students' suggestions and criticisms, and formulate work guidelines and reporting plans. Many League Newspapers have set up columns such as "League Life," "Introduction to the Youth League," and "League News" to promote students' understanding of the League and resolve students' ideological concerns and misunderstandings about joining the League. They also published articles on League members' motivations for joining the League, self-criticism, and ideological transformation processes. The "Small Comments" in the League Newspapers promptly corrected and criticized the closed-doorism trend in the construction of the League, which educated the League members and also educated the masses. In some schools, the loose work style of individual League members has affected the prestige of the League among the masses. This has been improved through public criticism from the League Newspapers and self-criticism from the League members. With a spirit of bold criticism, the League Newspapers are testing the work of the League and urging the progress of the students in front of the majority of students. The League Newspapers closely contact the masses, cultivate a large number of excellent students to become the backbone of the League among the masses, and many have been gradually absorbed into their own ranks.

Due to the fact that the League Newspapers in various schools are still in the stage of growth and initial creation, there are still many shortcomings in their progress: First, some League Newspapers lack the spirit of discussing issues, so that students' understanding of the issues cannot be deeper. Second, the publication time of the League Newspapers is long, and they cannot closely cooperate with the progress of the movement. The movement is about to end, and the calls and instructions are only published, which weakens the role that the League Newspapers should play. Other shortcomings include the failure of a small number of League Newspapers to universally mobilize writing, forming a situation where a few League members run the newspapers, and the content lacks a lively and lively style. However, judging from the existing achievements of the League Newspapers, these shortcomings can be gradually overcome.

### 京市各学校的“团报”

　　京市各学校的“团报”
    北京市各学校青年团支部，举办的“团报”，在各校壁报中是吸引读者最多的，它和青年团一样受着广大同学的爱戴与拥护、通过它协助了学校指导学习，密切了青年团与群众的关系，也壮大了青年团在学校里的队伍。
    各校团支部一般都重视团报工作，为了健全团报的组织机构，使它充分发挥青年团同学之间的桥梁作用，有的团支部配备了优秀团员成立团报委员会，并吸收一部分进步同学参加。各分支和小组的负责同志是经常写稿的通讯员，并动员每个团员和同学写稿，使团报成为全体同学的共同园地。团报大部是以壁报形式出现的，这样的形式醒目，引人注意，传达消息快；也有一部分学校，如交大北京管理学院、华北大学二部、市立女一中等，采用油印小报的形式，每一个小组都能得到一份，这样更便于读者的参考与保存。
    各学校团报办得好的，都是团结学习这一中心来组织内容。它交流学习经验和学习方法，表扬和批评学习中的模范和落后分子，与错误思想进行斗争，鼓励同学们的学习情绪。在本学期各校展开新民主主义学习的运动时，不少同学在思想上还有抵抗，认为离开书本求学问就是空谈，未认清只有使书本与实际联系的学习方法才是提高学习效率的有力武器。针对这一问题团报便负起了打通思想、搞好学习的任务，在广大同学中进行宣传，树立正确的学习观点，为运动的开展打下思想基础。不少中学的青年团小报在登载了尊师爱生的文章以后，师生关系显然有了新的改进。团报直接间接地都服务了学习。
    团报不但帮助了学校的学习，在其他运动中同样起了推动作用，它根据青年团每一时期的中心工作，在事前帮助同学的思想酝酿与动员，在运动进行中指出正确方向，纠正偏向与缺点。例如各校进行评定人民助学金、节约救灾、义务劳动等工作中，团报都有力地起了配合作用。
    在提高同学政治思想水平，辅导建国工作上，团报也尽了它的责任。暑假以来的同学们经过紧张的政治学习都迫切要求了解青年团的组织生活和团的基本知识，团报在同学们这一要求的基础上召开团报工作座谈会，使同学们提出对团报的意见和要求，虚心接受同学们的建议和批评，订出工作方针和报导计划，不少团报都专辟了“团内生活”、“青年团介绍”、“团讯”等栏，促进同学对团的认识，解决同学对入团的思想顾虑和错误认识。并且登载团员的入团动机、自我检讨、思想转变过程等文章；团报“小言论”里及时纠正和批评建团中的关门主义倾向，这样教育了团员也教育了群众。有的学校中个别团员作风散漫以致影响了团在群众中的威信，经过团报的公开批评和团员的自我检讨而得到了改善。团报以大胆批评的精神在广大同学面前考验着团的工作也督促着同学们的进步，团报密切联系群众培养了大批的优秀同学成为团在群众中的骨干，也有不少逐渐地被吸收到自己的队伍中来。
    由于各校的团报正在成长和初创时期，在进步中还存在着不少的缺点：第一，有些团报缺乏对问题讨论的精神，使同学们对问题了解不能更深刻。第二，团报出刊时间长，不能密切配合运动的进行，运动将要结束了，号召和指示才登出来，削弱了团报应起的作用。其他如少数团报发动写稿不普遍形成几个团员办报，内容缺乏生动活泼的作风等。但是从团报已有的成绩看来，这些缺点是可以逐步地克服的。
