The Netherlands has handed over some weapons and supplies to Dutch troops fighting Indonesian guerrillas in the interior. The Dutch Communist Party's newspaper, *De Waarheid*, pointed out: According to the plans of the American ruling clique, the war against the guerrillas will likely be carried out by Hatta's troops and the Dutch colonial army.

    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社海牙二十三日讯：据来自印尼的消息称：爪哇、苏门答腊与婆罗洲的情势，仍然紧张。近来，这些岛上的荷军已重新整编。他们主要集中在爪哇与苏门答腊沿海的大城市。荷兰已将部分武器和供应品交给在内地对印尼游击队作战的荷兰军队。荷共机关报真理报指出：按照美国统治集团的计划，反对游击队的战事大概将由哈达的军队及荷兰殖民军进行。至于荷军，则将根据侵略的北大西洋公约规定的任务在苏门答腊与爪哇重新训练。“荷印新闻”载称：反对哈达政府的达鲁尔·伊斯兰部队，正在展开相当大的活动。该报写道：实际上，西部与中部爪哇的大部分，都为达鲁尔·伊斯兰所控制。
