　　The Solidarity of the Working Class and the Tasks of Communist and Workers' Parties
  　Information Bureau Resolution
    I. The new war preparations being carried out by Anglo-American imperialists, and the crusade by bourgeois reactionaries against the democratic rights and economic interests of the working class and the people, demand that we intensify the struggle of the working class to maintain and consolidate peace, and organize a resolute counterattack against the onslaught of warmongers and imperialist reactionaries.
    The solidarity of the ranks of the working class is the guarantee of victory in this struggle. Post-war experience has proven that the policy of splitting the working-class movement is one of the primary tactics used by imperialists to launch new wars, suppress democratic and socialist forces, and drastically lower the living standards of the masses.
    In the history of the international working-class movement, the solidarity of the working class, both within a single country and on a global scale, has never been as decisive as it is now.
    The solidarity of the working class is a necessary condition for safeguarding peace, thwarting the heinous schemes of warmongers, defeating the conspiracies of imperialists against democracy and socialism, stopping the establishment of fascist rule, resolutely resisting the crusade of monopoly capital against the vital interests of the working class, and ensuring the improvement of the economic conditions of the working masses.
    These tasks can only be achieved on the basis of uniting the broad masses of the working class, regardless of their party affiliation, trade union organization, or religious beliefs. Unity from below - this is the most effective way to strengthen all the forces of the workers to defend peace and the national independence of their countries, and to defend the economic interests and democratic rights of all working people.
    Despite the opposition of the leadership centers of those trade unions and political parties headed by splitters and enemies of unity, the solidarity of the working class can be achieved.
    The post-war period is marked by the great achievements made in eliminating the division of the working class and in uniting all democratic forces; these achievements are manifested by the establishment of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Democratic Women's Federation and the World Federation Democratic Youth, and the convocation of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace.
    The achievements in unity are manifested in the consolidated French General Confederation of Labour, the establishment of a unified Italian General Confederation of Labour (Italian General Confederation of Labor), and the militant actions of the French and Italian proletariat.
    In the people's democracies, historical achievements have also been won in the unity of the working class: unified working-class parties, unified trade unions, unified cooperatives, youth, women and other organizations have already been established.
    This unity of the working class has played a decisive role in the economic and cultural development of the people's democracies, in ensuring the leading role of the working class in the country, and in fundamentally improving the material welfare the working masses.
    All of this demonstrates the great desire of the working people to consolidate their ranks, and demonstrates the real possibility of establishing a united working-class front against the reactionaries – from American imperialists to right-wing socialists.
    The U.S. and British imperialists and their lackeys in European countries are trying to split and disintegrate the proletariat and the forces of all the people, placing special hope on right-wing social democrats and reactionary trade union leaders. These right-wing social democrats and reactionary trade union leaders, acting on the direct orders of American and British imperialists, have split the ranks of the working-class movement from above, attempting to destroy the unified working-class organizations established after the war.
    They are trying to undermine the World Federation of Trade Unions from within; they are organizing groups of splitters, such as the "Workers' Force" in France and the so-called Labor Alliance in Italy, and now they are working to establish an international trade union organization dedicated to division.
    The leaders of Catholic organizations in various countries are also trying to divide the workers.
    The treacherous activities of the right-wing socialist leaders are the activities of the most vicious enemies of the unity of the working class and accomplices of imperialism – this is the conclusion drawn by the first meeting of the Communist Information Bureau – a conclusion that has been fully confirmed.
    Today, right-wing socialists are showing themselves to be not only the running dogs of their own national bourgeoisies, but also the running dogs of American imperialism, turning the social democratic parties of European countries into American parties and direct weapons of American imperialist aggression.
    In countries where right-wing socialists are in power (Britain, France, Austria, and the Scandinavian countries), they are eager to support the "Marshall Plan", the "Western European Union," the "North Atlantic Treaty," and all other forms of American expansion.
    These pseudo-socialists play a despicable role, persecuting the working class and democratic organizations that defend the interests of the working people.
    These right-wing socialists have become increasingly degenerate, betraying the interests of the working class, democracy, and socialism, completely abandoning the doctrines of Marxism, and today appearing as supporters and advocates of American imperialist predatory thought.
    Their theories of "democratic socialism" and a "third force," their cosmopolitan nonsense about the need to abandon national sovereignty, are nothing more than an ideological smokescreen to conceal Anglo-American imperialist aggression.
    The so-called "International Socialist Conference Committee" -- the pitiful offspring of the rotten Second International -- has become the center where the most vicious splitters and saboteurs of the working-class movement gather. This organization has become a spy center serving the intelligence agencies of Anglo-American imperialism.
    Only through a resolute struggle against these right-wing socialist splitters and saboteurs in the working-class movement can the working class achieve unity.
    II. The Information Bureau believes that the primary task of the Communist Parties is to wage an unremitting struggle to unite and organize all the forces of the working class, to deliver a powerful counterattack to the overbearing demands of Anglo-American imperialism, to thwart its plans to launch a new world war, to defend and consolidate the cause of peace and international security, and to defeat the offensive of monopoly capital against the living standards of the working masses.
    In the current international situation, it is the responsibility of the Communist Parties to explain that if the working class does not ensure the unity of its ranks, it will lose its most important weapon in the struggle against the growing danger of a new world war and against the attack of imperialist reactionaries on the living standards of the working people.
    While engaging in an irreconcilable and consistent struggle in theory and action against right-wing socialist and reactionary trade union leaders, relentlessly exposing them and isolating them from the masses, the Communists must also patiently and persistently explain to the socialist democratic working masses the overall significance of the cause of working-class unity, attract them to actively participate in the struggle for peace, bread and the democratic right of freedom, and implement a policy of joint action to achieve these goals.
    A tried-and-true method of uniting the working class is the consistent action of various working-class groups, joint action in individual enterprises in direct municipalities, in entire industrial sectors, in a city, a region, a country, or worldwide; mobilizing the broadest masses to fight for their urgent and most easily understood demands, and thus helping to establish the long-term unity of the proletariat.
    The unified action of the working class from below can be seen in the establishment of peace committees in many factories and agencies; in the organization of mass demonstrations against warmongers; in the joint actions of workers to defend democratic rights and improve economic conditions.
    In the struggle to win the unity of the working class, special attention should be paid to the Catholic working masses and the general working people, as well as their organizations.
    In carrying out this work, it should be firmly remembered that religious belief is not an obstacle to the unity of the working people, especially when this unity is needed to save peace.
    Concrete joint actions in terms of economic demands and the coordination of struggles between class trade unions and Catholic trade unions, etc., can serve as an effective way to attract Catholic workers to participate in the general front for the struggle for peace.
    The most important task of the Communist Party in every capitalist country is to make every effort to ensure the unity of trade unions.
    At present, it is of great importance to attract those workers who have not yet been organized by industry to participate in trade unions and active struggles. In capitalist countries, such workers constitute a considerable proportion of the proletariat. If the Communist Parties carry out genuine work among the unorganized workers, they will achieve great success winning the unity of the working class.
    The Information Bureau believes that on the basis of the unity the working class, it is necessary to achieve the national unity of all democratic forces and mobilize the masses of people to wage a struggle against Anglo-American imperialism and domestic reactionaries. It is extremely important to carry out daily work in the mass organizations of the working people, women, youth, peasants, cooperatives and other organizations.
    The unity of the working-class movement and the strengthening of all democratic forces are not only necessary for solving the daily tasks of the working class and the working people, but also for solving the main problems faced by the proletariat – as a leading class in the struggle to abolish the power of monopoly capital and transform society according to socialist principles.
    On the basis of the success achieved in establishing the unity of the ranks of the working-class movement and in strengthening all democratic forces, it will be possible in various capitalist countries to develop the struggle to win the establishment of a government that unites all patriotic forces against the enslavement of their countries by American imperialism, a government that will adopt a policy of ensuring a lasting peace among all nations, will stop the arms race, and will raise the living standards of the working people.
    In the people's democratic countries, the task of the Communist and Workers' Parties is to further consolidate the unity of the working class that has already been achieved, and to further consolidate the unity of trade unions, cooperatives, women, youth, and other organizations.
    The Information Bureau believes that to achieve further success in the struggle for the unity of the working class and the strengthening of democratic forces depends, first and foremost, on the improvement of the entire organizational and ideological work of each Communist and Workers' Party. Of particular significance for these parties is the ideological exposure and irreconcilable struggle against any manifestations of opportunism, sectarianism and bourgeois nationalism, as well as the struggle against the infiltration of enemy agents into the party. The lessons arising from the exposure of the Tito-Ranković spy group urgently require the Communist and Workers' Parties to raise their revolutionary vigilance to the greatest extent. The Tito group of spies has today become the most frantic saboteurs of the ranks of the working class and the democratic movement, carrying out the will of the American imperialists. Therefore, whenever these imperialist agents attempt to be active in the working class and democratic organizations, a resolute struggle must be waged against their conspiracies. The organizational and ideological-political strengthening of the Communist and Workers' Parties based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism is the most important condition for the victorious struggle of the working class for the unity of its ranks, for the cause of peace and the national independence of their countries, and for democracy and socialism.

　　工人阶级的团结与共产党及工人党的任务
  　情报局决议
    一、英美帝国主义者所进行的新战争准备，资产阶级反动派反对工人阶级与人民群众民主权利及经济利益的十字军，都要求我们加紧工人阶级的斗争，去保持与巩固和平，并对战争贩子及帝国主义反动派的猛攻组织坚决的反击。
    工人阶级队伍的团结，是这一斗争获得胜利的保证。战后的经验证明：分裂工人阶级运动的政策，是帝国主义者策略武库中首先使用的法宝之一，他们用这些法宝来发动新战争，镇压民主与社会主义的力量，和大肆降低人民群众的生活水准。
    在国际工人阶级运动的历史上，工人阶级在一国范围内以及在世界范围内的团结，从来没有象现在这样具有决定意义。
    工人阶级的团结，乃是保障和平，挫败战争贩子的罪恶计谋，击败帝国主义者对民主与社会主义的阴谋，制止建立法西斯统治的方法，坚决反击垄断资本反对工人阶级切身利益的十字军及确保劳动大众经济条件之改善的必要条件。
    这些任务首先要把工人阶级的广大群众，不分其所属党派、工会组织或宗教信仰而团结起来的基础上，才能得到实现。　 从下面团结起来——这就是加强工人的一切力量来保卫和平与其国家的民族独立及保卫全体劳动人民经济利益和民主权利的最有效的方法。
    尽管有以分裂分子和团结的敌人为首的那些工会和政党的领导中心的反对，但工人阶级的团结是可以达到的。
    战后时期是以在消除工人阶级的分裂上，及在团结全体民主力量上所取得的巨大成就为标志的；这些成就表现在世界工会联合会、国际民主妇联、世界民主青年联盟的成立上、表现在世界拥护和平大会的召开上。
    团结的成就表现在巩固的法国总工会上、表现在一个统一的意大利工会联合会（意大利总工会）的建立上、表现在法国和意大利无产阶级的战斗行动上。
    在人民民主国家，在工人阶级的团结上，也赢得了历史性的成就：统一的工人阶级政党、统一的工会、统一的合作社、青年、妇女及其他组织，都已经建立起来了。
    这一工人阶级的统一，在人民民主国家的经济和文化发展、在确保工人阶级在国家的领导作用和在根本改善劳动群众物质福利这三方面所已取得的成就上，已起了决定性的作用。
    所有这一切，显示出劳动人民对于巩固其队伍的巨大的愿望，显示出建立一个反对反动派——从美国帝国主义者到右翼社会党人——的联合力量的统一的工人阶级战线的真正可能性。
    美、英帝国主义者及其在欧洲国家的仆从，力图分裂和瓦解无产阶级和全体人民力量，对右派社会党人和反动的工会领袖寄以特别的希望。右派社会党人和反动的工会领袖，他们遵照美国和英国帝国主义者的直接命令，从上面分裂了工人阶级运动的行列，力图破坏在战后建立起来的统一的工人阶级组织。
    他们力图从内部破坏世界工联；他们组织分裂分子的集团，如法国的“工人力量”和意大利的所谓劳工联盟，现在他们努力准备成立一个从事分裂的国际工会机构。
    各国的天主教团体的领袖们也力图分裂工人。
    右翼社会党领袖们的叛卖活动，是工人阶级的统一之最凶恶的敌人和帝国主主帮凶的活动——这是共产党情报局第一次会议所下的断语——这个断语已完全获得证实。
    今天，右翼社会党人所表现出来的，不仅是本国资产阶级的走狗，而且还是美国帝国主义的走狗，把欧洲国家的社会民主党变成了美国党和美国帝国主义侵略的直接武器。
    在右翼社会党人执政的国家（英、法、奥和斯堪的纳维亚国家），他们出头热衷拥护“马歇尔计划”、“西欧联盟”、“北大西洋公约”以及其他一切美国扩张的形式。
    这些伪社会主义者扮演卑鄙的角色，迫害工人阶级和保卫劳动人民利益的民主组织。
    这些右翼社会党人，已愈来愈堕落，它们背叛工人阶级、民主和社会主义的利益，完全抛弃了马克思主义的学说，今天已以美国帝国主义掠夺思想的拥护者和鼓吹者的面目出现。
    他们的“民主社会主义”和“第三种力量”的理论，他们的关于需要放弃国家主权的世界主义胡说，无非是掩盖英美帝国主义侵略的思想烟幕。
    所谓“国际社会党会议委员会”——烂到骨头的第二国际的可怜子嗣——已成了工人阶级运动最凶恶的分裂者和破坏者团聚的中心。这个组织已经成了一个为英美帝国主义谍报机关服务的间谍中心。
    只有对工人阶级运动中这些右翼社会党的分裂者和破坏者进行坚决的斗争，工人阶级才能得到团结。
    二、情报局认为，共产党的首要任务就是进行不懈的斗争，团结和组织工人阶级的一切力量，予英美帝国主义底蛮横要求以强有力的反击；挫败其进行新的世界大战的打算；保卫并巩固和平事业与国际安全；使垄断资本对劳动大众生活水准的进攻归于失败。
    在目前国际局势下，共产党的责任就是要说明：如果工人阶级不确保其队伍的团结，那么它在反对增长着的新世界大战危险、和反对帝国主义反动派对劳动人民生活水准之进攻的斗争中，就会丧失自己最重要的武器。
    共产党人一方面在理论和行动上从事不调和的和一贯的斗争，反对右翼社会党的和反动的工会领袖，无情地揭发他们，使他们从群众中孤立起来；同时，还必须耐心而坚持不懈地向社会民主党的工人群众说明工人阶级团结事业底全盘意义，吸引他们参加争取和平、面包与民主的自由权利的积极斗争，并执行一个联合行动的政策，以达到这些目的。
    使工人阶级团结的一个百试百验的办法，就是各种各样工人队伍的行动一致，直辖市个别企业中、整个工业部门中、一个城市中、一个地区中、一国或全世界范围内的联合行动；动员最广大的群众为他们的迫切和最明白易晓的要求而斗争，并这样来帮助建立无产阶级队伍的长期团结。
    工人阶级从下面来进行的统一行动，可见于许多工厂和机关中成立和平委员会上；可见于组织反对战争贩子的群众示威上；可见于工人们为保卫民主权利和改善经济状况而作的联合行动上。
    在争取工人阶级团结的斗争中，应特别注意到天主教工人群众和一般的劳动人民以及他们的组织。
    在进行这一工作时，应牢牢地记住：宗教信仰并不是劳动人民团结的一个障碍，特别是在为拯救和平而需要这一团结的时候。
    经济要求方面的具体的联合行动和阶级工会与天主教工会等等的斗争的配合，可以作为吸引天主教工人参加为和平而斗争的总阵线的有效方法。
    每个资本主义国家的共产党的最重要的任务，就是尽一切努力确保工会的团结。
    目前，吸引那些还没有按产业组织起来的工人参加工会和参加积极的斗争，具有很大的重要性。在资本主义的国家中，这种工人构成了无产阶级的一个相当大的比例。假如共产党在无组织的工人当中进行了真正的工作，那他们在获致工人阶级的团结上，将得到巨大的成就。
    情报局认为，在工人阶级团结的基础上，必需要达到一切民主力量的全国大团结，动员起人民群众进行反对英美帝国主义和国内反动派的斗争。极端重要的是在劳动人民的群众组织，妇女、青年、农民、合作社和其他组织中进行日常工作。
    工人阶级运动的团结和一切民主力量的加强，不仅对于解决工人阶级和劳动人民的日常任务是必要的，而且对于解决无产阶级——作为一个领导废除垄断资本政权和按照社会主义方针改造社会的斗争的阶级——所面临的主要问题也是必要的。
    在建立工人阶级运动的队伍的团结和在加强一切民主力量获得成功的基础上，将使得在各资本主义国家中有可能发展斗争，以争取成立一个团结一切反对美帝国主义奴役其国家的爱国力量的政府，这个政府将采取确保各族人民间巩固和平的政策、将停止军备竞赛并提高劳动人民生活水平。
    在人民民主国家中，共产党和工人党的任务，就是更加巩固业已获致的工人阶级的团结，更加巩固工会、合作社、妇女、青年及其他组织的团结。
    情报局认为，在争取工人阶级团结和加强民主力量的斗争中，要取得进一步的成就，首先就取决于每个共产党和工人党的整个组织和思想工作的改进。　 对这些党有特出意义的，就是对机会主义、宗派主义和资产阶级民族主义的任何表现作思想上的暴露并进行不调和的斗争，以及反对敌人的奸细混入党内的斗争。由铁托——兰科维奇间谍集团的暴露而引起的教训，迫切地要求共产党和工人党把它们的革命警觉性提高到最大程度。　 铁托集团奸细今日已成为工人阶级和民主运动队伍的最疯狂的破坏者，他们执行着美帝国主义者的意旨。　 因此，无论任何时候，当这些帝国主义代理人企图在工人阶级和民主组织中活动时，就必须对他们的阴谋进行坚决的斗争。　 共产党和工人党建基于马列主义原则的组织上和思想——政治上的加强，是工人阶级为自己队伍的团结、为和平事业和各该国民族独立和为民主与社会主义而进行胜利斗争的最重要的条件。
