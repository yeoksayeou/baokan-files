Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th: The China National Salvation Association has been established for fourteen years. Now, it has been decided to simultaneously announce the end of its work in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou on the 18th, and issue a declaration. The full text is as follows:

Fellow countrymen!
Friends at home and abroad!
Comrades!

The China National Salvation Association was born in a time when the Chinese people were suffering from internal and external disasters, and the national crisis was extremely profound. For fourteen years, it has grown, developed, progressed, and advanced along with the strength of the Chinese people; it has coordinated with the mainstream of the people's great revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party, and has continuously carried out work and struggle to unite all Chinese people, save the national crisis, oppose internal and external oppressors, and complete the cause of people's liberation.

Now, this work and struggle has achieved the expected results, and the political propositions advocated by the China National Salvation Association have all been realized. It has successfully completed its historical mission. As a people's political organization, it no longer needs to exist. It announces its own glorious end to all fellow countrymen, friends, and comrades.

On the day of the Association's end, it is necessary to make a historical summary of the experiences of work and struggle over the past fourteen years, and at the same time point out the direction and goals of the efforts of our comrades in the future.

Fellow countrymen! Friends and Comrades!

Fourteen years ago, during the low ebb of the thirty-year history of the Chinese People's Great Revolution, were the darkest and most dangerous days.

Chiang Kai-shek, at the head of the Chinese big bourgeoisie, betrayed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary teachings after 1927, colluded with imperialism and feudal forces, and carried out a bloody rule against the Communists and the people, which resulted in a very serious national disaster. After invading and occupying Northeast China, the Japanese bandits advanced into Inner Mongolia and North China, attempting to make China Japan's exclusive colony. The Kuomintang reactionary government surrendered to the national enemy on the one hand, and carried out a frantic anti-Communist civil war on the other. At that time, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army led by the Chinese Communist Party was withdrawing from Jiangxi and was on its way north to resist Japan. Most parts of the country were shrouded in white terror, and workers, peasants, and students were oppressed and could hardly breathe. The national bourgeoisie stood by and watched. Most intellectuals were passive, decadent, and lost their direction. The fall of the country was imminent, but the surroundings were as silent as death. This was what Mr. Lu Xun called "the silent China" at that time.

This situation could not continue for long. In the second half of 1935, the Chinese Communist Party first published the famous August 1st Declaration, calling on all parties and factions to unite and jointly resist Japan. Due to the strict news blockade in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the response to this historical document was very weak at the time, but in the big cities, the impact had gradually increased the patriotic enthusiasm and initiative of progressive young students and intellectuals. First, the students in Beiping launched two anti-Japanese demonstrations and marches on December 9th and 16th, clashed with the military police, and broke the temporary silence. Then, on December 18th, the Shanghai Cultural Circles National Salvation Association was announced, and later expanded into the All Circles National Salvation Association. The angry tide of resisting Japan and saving the country began to surge from north to south.

The Shanghai All Circles National Salvation Association was organized with the cultural circles as the backbone, uniting the professional circles, industrial circles, women's circles, student circles, and education circles. The initial initiators and participants were only a small number of people with a sense of justice and patriotic enthusiasm, mainly intellectuals. However, soon after, the national salvation movement was widely launched in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and deeply penetrated into all strata. On May 11, 1936, under the call and leadership of Mr. Soong Ching Ling, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, and Mr. Shen Junru, the National All Circles National Salvation Association was established in Shanghai, and the national salvation movement quickly unfolded across the country. Organizations of the National Salvation Association were established in major cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Guangzhou, and even overseas. The call of the National Salvation Association for "unity against foreign aggression" and "stopping the civil war and saving the country by resisting Japan" became the common demand and unanimous voice of the people across the country. The National Salvation Movement was not only supported by the professional circles, sports circles, young students, but also gained the sympathy and support of some business and industrial figures and Kuomintang soldiers.

Although this movement adopted the method of legal struggle, it was severely suppressed and attacked by the reactionary government from the beginning. From 1935 to 1937, people across the country were arrested, imprisoned, and even sacrificed their lives for participating in the National Salvation Association. On November 22, 1936, seven leaders of the National Salvation Association, Mr. Shen Junru, Mr. Zou Taofen, Mr. Li Gongpu, Ms. Shi Liang, Mr. Zhang Naiqi, Mr. Sha Qianli, and Mr. Wang Zaoshi, were arrested and sent to the Suzhou Higher Court for detention. Mr. Sun Xiaocun and Mr. Cao Mengjun were also arrested in Nanjing. They were not freed until the start of the War of Resistance against Japan in August 1937.

However, the people's national salvation movement was not suppressed by the reactionary government. On the contrary, it rapidly developed to its climax. People across the country demonstrated and petitioned everywhere, opposing pro-Japanese diplomacy and demanding that the Nanjing government send troops to resist Japan. Due to the call of the August 1st Declaration and the influence of the national salvation movement, on December 12, 1936, General Zhang Xueliang and General Yang Hucheng and the Northeast Army revolted in Xi'an. Chiang Kai-shek was forced to accept the demand to stop the civil war and jointly resist Japan. Later, the Kuomintang government had to change its policy and stop suppressing the Communists, which promoted the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party after the July 7th Incident and the all-out War of Resistance against Japan. The serious national crisis since 1918 was saved, and China avoided the path of complete colonization.

In the early days of the War of Resistance against Japan, members of the National Salvation Association across the country and the thousands of young people called and mobilized by the National Salvation Association went to the front lines, the rear areas, and the guerrilla areas behind enemy lines to participate in the work of resisting the enemy, and played a considerable role in the struggle for unity, resistance, and progress. A large number of comrades from the National Salvation Association entered northern Shaanxi and northern Jiangsu, joined the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and were tempered into many excellent revolutionary cadres in actual combat. (⑴⑵)

In the later period of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group prepared to surrender and compromise with Japanese fascism and resume the anti-Communist civil war. After the Anhui Incident in 1941, the situation was critical. Some comrades of the National Salvation Association were forced to flee to Hong Kong and overseas, and comrades scattered across the country continued to oppose dictatorship and division, surrender and compromise with Japan; they advocated the establishment of a democratic coalition government and resisted Japan to the end. During the period when the China Democratic Political League—the predecessor of the China Democratic League—was established, some comrades of the National Salvation Association played an organizational and promoting role. Throughout the entire period of the War of Resistance against Japan, the comrades of the National Salvation Association made their best efforts to avoid domestic division and adhere to the resistance against Japan to the end, and achieved the expected results.

After the end of the War of Resistance against Japan, the strength of the Chinese people was greatly enhanced compared to before the war. However, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group still remained an enemy of the people, stole the fruits of victory, sold itself to American imperialism, tore up the resolutions of the Old Political Consultative Conference, and launched a large-scale anti-Communist and anti-people civil war. China was about to be ruined again and become an exclusive colony of American imperialism. During this period, the National Salvation Association changed its name to the China National Salvation Association and cooperated with the Chinese Communist Party to carry out the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Most of the comrades of the Association participated in the China Democratic League and other democratic parties, adhered to the people's point of view and revolutionary stance, resolutely opposed the middle road and the third road, and opposed the illusion of peaceful compromise with American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government. In May 1948, the China National Salvation Association and various democratic parties in Hong Kong jointly responded to the May 1st Slogan of the CPC, advocating the convocation of a new Political Consultative Conference and the establishment of a democratic coalition government. Due to the great victory of the People's Liberation Army's all-out counterattack after 1947, the People's Republic of China was born, and the Central People's Government was established. The consistent political propositions of the National Salvation Association were fully realized. The cause of liberation of the Chinese people has achieved a basic victory.

Fourteen years, only fourteen years, and China's face is very different. Not only has the national crisis been saved, but the Chinese nation has stood up. The Chinese people have been liberated. Who's strength did they rely on? It relied entirely on the great strength of the Chinese people, on the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the heroic combat of the People's Liberation Army. If we were to say that without relying on the strength of the people, without relying on the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, the China National Salvation Association and the National Salvation Movement could turn the world upside down and save the critical situation, that would be a completely wrong idea. We comrades of the National Salvation Association never think like that.

But on the other hand, we want to say proudly that our work over the past fourteen years has not been in vain. Over the past fourteen years, the National Salvation Movement has produced some results in uniting the Chinese people and carrying out education and transformation. First of all, our comrades and friends of the National Salvation Association have educated and improved ourselves in the common work and struggle of these fourteen years. After educating and improving ourselves, we have educated and improved some backward masses. In this way, we have indeed guided a group of people to progress and to the truth. The National Salvation Association united many of the most outstanding writers, educators, musicians, artists, journalists, and scientists, and has been constantly struggling for the establishment of a new culture for the Chinese people since the darkest period fourteen years ago. On the cultural front, our comrades have indeed completed a part of the combat mission.

It should be particularly mentioned here that the most outstanding leaders and the most steadfast martyrs of the National Salvation Movement, Mr. Zou Taofen, Mr. Tao Xingzhi, Mr. Li Gongpu, and Mr. Du Chongyuan, used their talents in writing, poetry, works, lectures, and organization to play an immeasurable role in enlightening the masses and educating the masses. They suffered sacrifices for the cause of the people, and they became a permanent model for Chinese intellectuals to sacrifice themselves and be loyal to the people. They and all the people's heroes who dedicated themselves to the National Salvation Movement will be immortal!

The National Salvation Association and the National Salvation Movement have these achievements, but they have not been completely without twists and turns. Our comrades of the National Salvation Association did not have this magnificent spirit and correct revolutionary understanding from the beginning. As we have already said, at the beginning, the members of the National Salvation Association were mainly intellectuals with a sense of justice. They only carried out work with temporary enthusiasm for saving the country, and their political and ideological understanding was not deep enough. At first, most of us were groping in the dark, and it was not uncommon to take the wrong path and run into walls more than once.

But later, we finally found the way, and we moved towards the light. This was all because we learned and exercised from work and struggle, and learned some valuable experience from work and struggle.

What are the main experiences learned from the work and struggle of the past fourteen years?

First, we recognized the greatness of the people's strength. Although the National Salvation Association has always called for relying on the people and believed that the final victory belongs to the people, both during the War of Resistance against Japan and during the People's Liberation War. But a large part of the people, including some of our comrades and friends, were still skeptical. Later, the facts proved that the strength of the Chinese people is incomparably powerful, and everything depends on the strength of the people. If we separate ourselves from the people, we will accomplish nothing. Some friends also over-believed in their own strength and did not believe in the strength of the people. They finally lost their way and dropped out of the ranks.

Second, we recognized that there are not many roads for the Chinese revolution, only the road of the Chinese Communist Party, the road of Mao Zedong. We are in the great historical era of proletarian revolution. Without the strong leadership of the proletariat, it is impossible for the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries to overthrow the rule of imperialism and feudalism and gain freedom and liberation. Over the past fourteen years, we have seen a lot. Many Chinese intellectuals, including our former friends, wanted to set aside the Communist Party and find an independent path for themselves. What kind of path did they find? It is the road to reaction, a dead end.

Third, we recognized that unity is strength. There must be struggle in unity, and struggle is for unity and consolidating unity. Experience tells us that without the struggle against the civil war and against internal and external fascism before the War of Resistance against Japan, the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and the all-out War of Resistance against Japan would not have been possible. In the past three or four years, without the resolute struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the great unity of the people across the country, as manifested by the People's Political Consultative Conference, would not have been possible. In the National Salvation Movement, some friends only knew how to struggle but did not understand unity, and ruined all the things that should have been done well. But some others only united without principle, neglecting the necessary criticism and struggle in politics and ideology. As a result, they abandoned their own positions in vain and did not achieve true unity.

Fourth, we recognized that we must constantly seek progress and learn again and again. Not progressing is regressing, and time does not allow you to stop halfway. Our comrades have been constantly seeking progress for more than ten years. We did not recognize the truth from the beginning, and we have not been without mistakes all the way. Many comrades were bourgeois liberals in the past, but now they tend towards Marxism-Leninism; in the past, they were British and American old democrats, but now they are on the road to socialism and communism. Even the more advanced elements among us once had erroneous ideas of bourgeois nationalism, but now, they have broken through the narrow cage of nationalism and become patriotic internationalists. This shows that ideological backwardness is not terrible, and education and transformation cannot be successful all at once. The main thing is that we can constantly seek progress, and we must have the courage to accept the truth and pursue the truth.

Today, the situation is completely different. The times have progressed too fast. The people of China have united, and the new China of new democracy has been born. We have a common program unanimously supported by the people across the country, we have a bright vision of moving towards socialism and communism, and we have the correct and unified leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Can we comrades of the National Salvation Association still stay in our original position? Can we not improve ourselves politically and ideologically and catch up? That is not possible. In order not to lag behind the times, in order to be able to shoulder the greater tasks of today and tomorrow, we must improve ourselves politically and ideologically.

Precisely because of this, we are no longer satisfied with our own organization. In order to improve ourselves and more widely unite and educate the masses of the people, the organizational form of the China National Salvation Association can no longer meet the subjective requirements of our comrades.

In fact, in recent years, our comrades of the National Salvation Association have been scattered to work in various different positions. Many of our comrades have honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party. A large part of them have joined the China Democratic League and other democratic parties, and have participated in various people's organizations. Our comrades have never regarded the China National Salvation Association as their own mountain stronghold or their own small circle. Therefore, the elimination of the organizational form of the China National Salvation Association will make it easier for our comrades to work more actively in various positions.

Although we are working separately, our direction should be consistent, and our goals should also be consistent.

We ask our comrades not to be satisfied with themselves, but to wash away the dust on their bodies at any time and correct their shortcomings.

We ask our comrades to serve the people more loyally, believe in the strength of the people, and do everything for the people.

We ask our comrades to get closer to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong.

We ask our comrades to work hard to strengthen and consolidate the great unity of the people.

We ask our comrades to learn, learn again, constantly seek progress, and always face the truth.

What is all this for? It is to thoroughly implement the New Democracy Common Program, to build a new China that is independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong, and to quickly move towards socialism and communism, and realize the bright prospects pointed out by Chairman Mao Zedong in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship."

Compatriots! Friends! Comrades! The China National Salvation Association, as a people's political organization, no longer exists. Let us shout:

Long live the China National Salvation Association!

Long live the people's heroes who sacrificed themselves for the National Salvation Movement!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

December 18, 1949

　　中国人民救国会结束宣言
    【新华社北京十七日电】中国人民救国会创立已届十四年。现在该地决定于十八日在北京、上海、广州三地同时宣布结束工作，并发表宣言，全文如下：
    全国同胞！
    国内国外的朋友们！
    同志们！
    中国人民救国会产生在中国人民遭受内外灾难，民族危机十分深重的时日，十四年以来。它随着中国人民的力量的伸张、成长、发展、进步；它配合了中国共产党所领导的人民大革命的主流，为了团结全中国人民，挽救民族危机，反对内外压迫者和完成人民解放事业，不断地进行工作和斗争。
    现在这一工作和斗争已经获得所预期的效果，中国人民救国会所号召的政治主张已经全部实现。它胜利地完成了它所负担的历史任务。作为人民的政治性的组织，它已没有存在的必要。它向全国同胞，朋友们和同志们宣告它自己的光荣的结束。
    在本会宣告结束这一天，把十四年来工作斗争的经验，作历史性的总结，同时指出本会同志们今后努力的方向和目标，是有必要的。
    全国同胞！朋友们和同志们！
    十四年以前，正当中国人民大革命三十年历史中的低潮时期，是最昏暗是危殆的一些日子。
    以蒋介石为首的中国大资产阶级，在一九二七年以后，背叛了孙中山先生的革命遗教，勾结帝国主义和封建势力，进行反共反人民的血腥统治，由此招致了十分严重的民族灾难。日本强盗在侵占东北之后，又向内蒙和华北进兵，企图使中国成为日本的独占殖民地。国民党反动政府一面向民族敌人投降屈服，一面进行疯狂的反共内战。当其时，中国共产党领导的工农红军，正由江西撤出，在北上抗日的途中。全国大部分地区在白色恐怖笼罩下，工农学生被压迫得喘不过气来。民族资产阶级袖手旁观。大部分知识分子消极颓丧，迷失了方向。亡国就在眼前，周围却象死一般地静寂．这就是当时鲁迅先生所称为“无声的中国”。
    这种形势是不可能长期继续下去的。一九三五年下半年，中国共产党首先发表了著名的八一宣言，号召各党各派联合共同抗日。由于国民党统治区内严密的新闻封锁，这一历史的文件，当时所引起的回音虽然十分微弱，但在大城市中，影响所及，已使进步的青年学生知识分子的爱国情绪和积极性逐渐上升。首先是北平学生，于十二月九日和十六日，发动了两次的抗日大示威游行，和军警冲突，打破一时的沉闷空气。接着，十二月十八日，上海文化界救国会宣告成立，以后扩充为各界是救国联合会，抗日救亡的怒潮，从北到南，开始汹涌起来了。
    上海各界救国联合会是以文化界为骨干，联合职业界、工界、妇女界、学生界、教育界组织起来的。最初的发起者和参加者只是一小部分具有正义感和爱国热情的人士，主要是一些知识分子。但是不久以后，救国运动就在国民党统治区内广泛展开，普遍深入到各阶层。一九三六年五月十一日，在宋庆龄、马相伯、沈钧儒诸先生号召和领导之下，全国各界救国联合会在上海成立，救国运动在全国各地迅速展开。北平、天津、南京、广州各大城市，以至海外，都建立了救国会的组织。救国会所号召的“团结御侮”，“停止内战，抗日救亡”成为全国人民共同的要求和一致的呼声。救国运动不但为职业界、运动界、青年学生所拥护，而且也获得一部分工商界人士和国民党军人的同情支援。
    这一运动虽然采取合法斗争的方式，但从开始就受到反动政府的严厉镇压和打击。从一九三五到三七年，全国各地都有因参加救国会而被捕入狱以至牺牲生命的。一九三六年十一月二十二日，救国会七位领袖沈钧儒、邹韬奋、李公朴、史良、章乃器、沙千里、王造时先生被捕，送苏州高等法院羁押，孙晓村、曹孟君先生也在南京被捕，直到一九三七年八月抗战开始才恢复自由。
    但是人民救国运动到底没有被反动政府镇压下去，相反地，却迅速发展到最高潮。全国人民到处示威请愿。反对亲日外交，要求南京政府出兵抗日。由于八一宣言的号召和救国运动的影响，一九三六年十二月十二日，张学良、杨虎城将军和东北军在西安起义，蒋介石被迫接受停止内战共同抗日的要求。以后，国民党政府就不得不改变政策，停止剿共，由此促成七七以后的国共合作和全面抗战，一九一八以来严重的民族危机得到了挽救，中国避免走上完全殖民地化的道路。
    在抗战初期，全国各地的救国会会员和救国会所号召动员的千千万万的青年群众，到了前线后方和敌后游击区，参加抗敌工作，在争取团结、抗战和进步的斗争中，起了相当重要的作用。大批的救国会同志，进入陕北和苏北，参加八路军和新四军，在实际的战斗中，锻炼成不少优秀的革命干部。（⑴⑵）
    在抗战后期，蒋介石反动集团准备向日本法西斯投降妥协，重行进行反共内战。一九四一年皖南事变以后，形势危急。救国会一部分同志被迫流亡香港海外，和分散在国内各地的同志们，继续不断进行反对独裁分裂、对日投降妥协；主张建立民主联合政府，抗战到底。当中国民主政团同盟——中国民主同盟的前身——产生的时期，救国会一部分同志们曾起了组织和推动的作用。在抗日战争进行的整个时期内，救国会同志们，为了避免国内分裂，坚持抗战到底，尽了最大的努力，也得到了预期的效果。
    抗日战争结束以后，中国人民的力量比战前大大增强了。但是蒋介石反动集团却依然与人民为敌，窃取了胜利的果实，向美帝国主义卖身投靠，撕毁了旧政协决议，发动大规模的反共反人民内战。中国又要被断送掉，成为美帝国主义的独占殖民地了。救国会在这一时期，改名为中国人民救国会，配合中国共产党，进行反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的斗争。本会大部分同志们参加了中国民主同盟和其他民主党派，坚持人民观点和革命立场，坚决反对中间路线和第三条道路，反对对美帝国主义和国民党反动政府存和平妥协的幻想。一九四八年五月，中国人民救国会和各民主党派在香港共同响应中共五一口号，主张召开新政协，建立民主联合政府。由于一九四七年以后人民解放军全面反攻的巨大胜利，中华人民共和国诞生，中央人民政府成立，救国会一贯的政治主张得到了全部实现。中国人民解放事业，获得了基本的胜利成功。
    十四年，仅仅十四年，中国的面目大不相同了。不但民族危机得到了挽救，而且中国民族站立起来了。中国人民翻身了。这是倚靠了谁的力量呢？这完全倚靠了中国人民的伟大力量，倚靠了中国共产党的正确领导和人民解放军的英勇战斗。如果说，不倚靠人民的力量，不倚靠共产党和人民解放军，中国人民救国会和救国运动能够旋乾转坤，挽救危局，那是完全错误的想法，我们救国会同志们从不作如此想。
    但是另一方面，我们要骄傲地说，我们这十四年来的工作，并没有白费力气。这十四年来，在团结中国人民，进行教育改造这一方面，救国运动是产生了一些效果的。首先，我们救国会的同志们，朋友们，在这十四年的共同的工作和斗争中，教育了我们自己，提高了我们自己，于教育了和提高了自己之后，又教育和提高了一些落后群众。这样，我们确实引导了一部分人，走向进步，走向真理。救国会团结了不少最优秀的著作家、教育家、音乐家、艺术家、新闻记者和科学家，从十四年前最黑暗的时期起，就不断为建立中国人民新文化而斗争。在文化战线上，我们同志们确实完成了一部分的战斗任务。
    在这里应该特别提出的是救国运动的最卓越的领导者和最坚贞的殉道者邹韬奋、陶行知、李公朴、杜重远先生等，他们用了文章，诗歌，著作，讲演和组织的才能，在启发群众，教育群众的工作中，起了不可估量的作用。他们为了人民的事业而遭受牺牲，他们成为中国知识分子自我牺牲，为人民尽忠的永久典范。他们和一切为救国运动献身的人民英雄们将永垂不朽！
    救国会和救国运动有这一些成就，并不是完全没有经过曲折的，我们救国会同志们，并不是从开始就有这种雄伟的气概和正确的革命认识。我们已经说过，在开始的时候，救国会的成员，主要是一些具有正义感的知识分子，只是凭一时的救亡热情来进行工作，在政治上、思想上还不够有深切的认识。最初，我们大部分人只是在黑暗中摸索，摸错了路，碰上了壁这样的事，是不止一次再次的。
    但是到后来，我们终于摸出路来了，我们走向光明了。这全是因为我们从工作和斗争中学习锻炼，从工作和斗争中吸取一些宝贵的经验。
    十四年来工作和斗争中所吸取的主要经验是什么呢？
    第一、我们认识了人民力量的伟大。虽然救国会始终号召一切倚靠人民，认定最后胜利是属于人民的，在抗战时期如此，在人民解放战争时期亦如此。但有一大部分人，包含我们的一部分同志和朋友在内，还是将信将疑的。到后来，事实证明中国人民的力量是无比强大的，一切决定于人民的力量，脱离了人民就会一事无成。也有些朋友，过分相信自己的力量，不相信人民的力量，他们终于迷失了道路，他们掉了队伍。
    第二、我们认识了中国革命并没有很多的道路，只有中国共产党的道路，毛泽东的道路。我们是在无产阶级革命的伟大的历史时代。没有坚强的无产阶级的领导，殖民地半殖民地人民要想推翻帝国主义封建主义的统治，获得自由解放是没有可能的。十四年以来，我们看得多了，有不少中国的知识分子，连从前我们的朋友在内，要想撇开共产党，自己去找出一条独立的道路。他们所找出来的什么路呢？是走向反动的路，是一条死路。
    第三、我们认识了团结就是力量。团结之中要有斗争，斗争是为团结和巩固团结，经验告诉我们，在抗战以前没有反内战反内外法西斯的斗争，后来的国共合作全面抗战就没有可能。最近三四年来，没有反帝反封建反官僚资本的坚决斗争，从人民政协所表现的全国人民大团结，也是不可能实现的。在救国运动中间，有些朋友们只懂得斗争，不懂得团结，把本来应当搞好的事情全给搞垮了。但另有一些人，只是无原则地去团结，忽略了政治上思想上应有的批评斗争，结果是从然放弃了自己的立场，并没有做到真正的团结。
    第四、我们认识了要不断求进步，要学习再学习。不进步就是退步，时间不容许你停顿在中途。我们同志们十余年来都在不断求进步，决不是一开头就认识了真理，决不是一路来都没有犯错误。很多的同志们，在以前是资产阶级自由主义者，现在倾向马克思、列宁主义；在以前是英美旧民主主义者，现在是向着社会主义共产主义的路上走。我们中间，甚至比较前进的分子，也曾经有过资产阶级民族主义的错误思想，而现在，却已冲破了狭隘的民族主义的樊笼，成为爱国的国际主义者。这就说明了思想落后并不可怕，教育改造并不是一下子可以成功，主要却在于我们能不断求进步，我们要有勇气接受真理和追求真理。
    在今天，形势完全不同了。时代进步得太快了。全中国人民已经团结起来，新民主主义的新中国已经诞生。我们有了全国人民一致拥护的共同纲领，我们有了走向社会主义共产主义的光明远景，我们又有了中国共产党的正确的统一的领导。我们救国会的同志们还能停留在原来的地位上吗？还能不从政治上思想上提高自己迎头赶上吗？那是不能够的。为了使我们不落在时代后面，为了使我们能够担当起今日和明日的更重大的任务，我们是必须从政治上思想上提高自己。
    正因为如此，我们不再满足于我们自己的组织。为了提高我们自己和更广泛地团结和教育人民群众，中国人民救国会这一组织形式，已经不再能适应我们同志们的主观要求了。
    事实上，在近年来，我们救国会的同志们已经分散到各种不同的岗位上工作。我们的不少同志，很光荣地参加了中国共产党。一大部分参加了中国民主同盟和其他民主党派，参加了各种人民团体。我们的同志也从没有把中国人民救国会看作一个自己的山头或自己的小圈子。因此中国人民救国会这一组织形式的消灭将更便于我们同志们在各种岗位上更积极地分头努力。
    虽然是分头努力，我们的方向应当是一致的，我们的目标也应当是一致的。
    我们要求同志们不要自己满足，要随时清洗身上的尘灰，纠正自己的缺点。
    我们要求同志们更忠诚为人民服务，相信人民的力量，一切为人民。
    我们要求同志们更紧密地靠近中国共产党，靠近毛泽东主席。
    我们要求同志们努力加强和巩固人民的大团结。
    我们要求同志们学习，再学习，不断求进步，永远面向真理。
    这一切是为了什么呢？是为了彻底实现新民主主义共同纲领，为了建设独立民主和平统一富强的新中国，为了迅速走向社会主义和共产主义，实现毛泽东主席在“论人民民主专政”中所指出的光明的远景。
    同胞们！朋友们！同志们！作为人民的政治性的组织的中国人民救国会不再存在了。让我们高呼：
    中国人民救国会万岁！
    为救国运动牺牲的人民英雄们万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    　一九四九年十二月十八日
