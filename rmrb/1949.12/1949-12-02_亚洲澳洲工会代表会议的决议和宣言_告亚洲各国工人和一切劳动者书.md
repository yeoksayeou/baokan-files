　　Resolutions and Declaration of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference
    A Letter to Workers and All Laborers of Asian Countries

    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 1st] The full text of the "Letter from the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference to Workers and All Laborers of Asian Countries" is as follows:

    To all male and female laborers of Asian countries!
    Brothers and Sisters!

    We, the representatives of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference, representing millions of laborers from fourteen Asian countries, extend our brotherly greetings to you!

    Our representative conference was convened in accordance with the will and aspirations of Asian workers to discuss how to consolidate the mutual ties between trade unions in Asian countries and their connections with the world workers' movement; to discuss the most pressing issues for all laborers in our countries, such as how to eliminate the exploitation of our countries by imperialists, how to strive for genuine national independence and the people's democratic freedom, how to improve the lives of laborers, and the path to complete liberation.

    The Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference was held in November of this year in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, which was proclaimed by the Chinese people.

    The representative conference noted with great satisfaction the historical significance of the Chinese people's great victory. This victory was achieved because the Chinese working class united all classes, factions, groups, and individuals who opposed imperialism and its running dogs, formed a national united front, established a revolutionary army led by the working class, and, with the support of the entire people, especially the entire peasantry, waged a revolutionary war, defeating the combined forces of internal reactionaries and foreign imperialism.

    The representative conference, on behalf of Asian laborers, warmly congratulates the Chinese working class and the entire heroic Chinese people, and congratulates them on the establishment of their People's Republic.

    In some Asian countries where laborers have become masters of their own destiny, great democratic reforms have been realized and are being realized. In the People's Republic of China, the Mongolian People's Republic, and North Korea, the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and feudalism have been eliminated or are being eliminated once and for all. All laborers have been transformed from a position of slavery into masters of the state and society, able to create a happy future according to their own will. Progressive labor legislation has been implemented or is being prepared for implementation, the principle of equal pay for equal work is being implemented, and the material and cultural lives of laborers are being gradually improved.

    The victory of democracy in these countries encourages all oppressed people in Asia to rise up and fight against the imperialist colonial system of enslavement.

    The holding of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference in Beijing is clear evidence of the growing democratic forces in Asia. Democratic forces are growing stronger around the world. The camp of world peace and democracy is gaining the support of people in all countries.

    The great Soviet Union is the leader of the world's democratic forces. It is the hope and light of all working people. The great example of freedom, equality, and brotherly friendship among the various nationalities of the Soviet Union is of worldwide historical significance.

    While congratulating the outstanding successes of the liberated nations of Asia, the representative conference calls on all laborers to pay special attention to the cruel oppression, lack of rights, and inhuman living conditions suffered by laborers in Asian colonies, semi-colonies, and vassal states. The representative conference fully exposed the cruel exploitation of imperialist colonialists. Facts have proven that capitalism bears full responsibility for the enslavement and impoverishment of laborers in oppressed countries.

    The greedy imperialists, in order to restore and consolidate their rule over the Asian people, to intensify their enslavement, to extract more profits from them, and to seek a way out of the ever-growing economic crisis, are intensifying their economic, political, and military pressure on the oppressed people of Asia. The British, French, and Dutch imperialists, during the Second World War, promised the Asian countries that had fought alongside peace-loving people around the world to grant them the right to national independence. However, after the war, they violated this promise and used armed aggression to oppose the national liberation movements of the Asian people. American imperialism is leading this attack to suppress national liberation movements and equipping those reactionary forces in Asia.

    This barbarous and brutal plundering behavior of imperialism cannot but arouse resolute resistance from the people of the oppressed Asian colonial countries to defend their national independence, just as the armed forces of the people of France, the Netherlands, and Belgium resisted the fascist aggressors who invaded and enslaved their countries during the Second World War. In many oppressed countries in Asia, such as Vietnam, Malaya, Indonesia, Burma, and the southern part of Korea, the masses of people, unable to endure the brutal oppression of imperialism, are engaged in armed resistance, have established people's armed forces, are waging guerrilla warfare, and have established guerrilla zones and liberated areas of varying sizes, waging a brutal struggle against the attacks of imperialist robbers and their running dogs. In particular, the Vietnamese people have achieved great victories in their struggle against French colonialists.

    The representative conference expresses its boundless respect to these national heroes who are engaged in patriotic struggles against imperialist oppression. This patriotic struggle, as a result of correct leadership and the efforts and fearlessness of the entire people, will eventually achieve the sacred goal of national liberation.

    Imperialism, fearing that the development of national liberation movements in Asian countries would undermine the foundation of their rule, is even more frantically carrying out brutal suppression of the people in these oppressed countries. In addition to sending troops to attack the liberated areas and guerrillas in these countries, they are everywhere supporting reactionary forces, allowing these national traitors in these countries to establish fascist-style bloody rule under the protection of imperialist forces. Wherever they rule, they carry out white terror, destroy all democratic trade unions and other democratic organizations, and oppress, arrest, and even massacre the leaders and activists of these democratic organizations.

    In Malaya, under the domination of British imperialists, the activities of the Malayan Trade Union Federation have been banned, and its leaders, Veerasingam and Ganapathy, have been sentenced to death.

    In Indonesia, in the past year alone, more than 25,000 patriots and trade union activists have been imprisoned, and the leaders of the Central Indonesian Trade Union Organization, Harjono, Oetjiwa, and Darusman, have been executed by firing squad.

    In South Korea, the outstanding activists of the workers' movement - Kwon Jin-taek, Vice Chairman of the South Korean Textile Workers' Union, and Yoo Hyung-shik, member of the Presidium of the Labor Alliance, have been killed.

    In Iran, many trade union leaders have been arrested, and eight people have been sentenced to death in absentia, including Reza Rousta, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Trade Union Federation.

    In India, tens of thousands of activists in the workers' movement and other people's democratic movements have been thrown into prison. Comrade Tang Ke, General Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress and member of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, has been imprisoned without trial for more than a year. All the representatives elected by the All-India Trade Union Congress to attend the Second World Trade Union Congress have been arrested.

    In Burma, many democratic groups have been persecuted, many democratic fighters have been arrested, and they are often subjected to torture and massacres in concentration camps.

    In Thailand, democratic forces are persecuted by the reactionary rule supported by American imperialism. They not only oppress democratic trade unions, but also provoke conflicts between workers of different nationalities and ethnicities, with the aim of weakening the growing unity of the working class.

    In Japan, MacArthur Headquarters prohibited delegations from democratic trade unions from going abroad, preventing them from attending the Second World Trade Union Congress and this Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference, and instructed the reactionary Japanese government to suppress the workers' movement with armed forces. American tanks and machine guns were used against striking workers.

    At the same time, the agents of imperialism, the reactionary leaders of the American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the British Trades Union Congress, are, in accordance with the orders of their masters, dividing the workers' movement within various countries and throughout the world. They are committing heinous crimes in the Asian workers' movement, instructing and colluding with reactionary elements in these countries to establish reactionary police unions, and attempting to unite these pseudo-unions led by the police to form a so-called Asian Labor League, in an attempt to suppress the struggle of Asian laborers for national independence and their rights to life and democratic freedom.

    The representative conference calls on trade unions and laborers of Asian countries to fight for the realization of the principles in the resolution on colonial and semi-colonial countries adopted by the Second World Trade Union Congress in Milan:

    Eliminate the system of colonies, protectorates, and dependencies as the scope of economic exploitation of imperialism. Develop trade union organizations regardless of race, color, nationality, or creed. Demand legislation to protect labor. Oppose any discrimination in social, economic, or political aspects based on differences in race, creed, or gender. Demand equal pay for equal work in public and private enterprises. Demand the abolition of anti-labor laws and the abolition of slave labor. Fight to protect the daily and immediate economic and political interests of workers.

    The representative conference, representing millions of laborers in Asia, firmly protests against the destruction of trade unions and other democratic organizations and the persecution of the leaders of these democratic organizations by imperialism and its running dogs in India, Japan, Iran, South Korea, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, and other oppressed countries in Asia.

    The representative conference demands the restoration of democratic freedoms in these countries, especially the freedom to organize trade unions, the immediate release of workers' movement activists and all fighters for national liberation and democratic freedom in prisons; and calls on workers in Asian countries to resolutely oppose the conspiracies and actions of those American and British capitalist running dogs to split workers' organizations, consolidate their unity, and not be deceived by these traitors to the working class.

    The representative conference calls on workers and all people in oppressed countries in Asia to resolutely resist the armed aggression of colonialists, and to give all possible support to the patriotic people who are waging arduous struggles to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland.

    Workers and workers' movement activists in oppressed Asian countries! Your representatives said at the conference that when you cannot work in cities under white terror rule, you should go to guerrilla areas, join the guerrillas, and expand and strengthen the backbone and leadership of the working class in these people's armed forces in the process of continuous struggle. The representative conference welcomes this patriotic action, which shows how workers have chosen a heroic path to expand the struggle for national liberation.

    Workers and laborers in oppressed Asian countries! You know that your liberation is inseparable from the liberation of your nation. To achieve fundamental improvements in your social status and working conditions, you must first strive for genuine national independence and the democratic freedom of the entire masses. You should become the bravest, most resolute, and most thorough fighters in the struggle for national liberation. You should take the initiative to unite the vast peasantry, intellectuals, urban petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie who oppose imperialism, and form a strong national united front, and let this united front, under your leadership, carry out the struggle against imperialism and its running dogs. The worker-peasant alliance is one of the basic conditions for your ultimate victory. Only when your struggle truly gains the support of the vast masses of people throughout the country who oppose imperialism and its running dogs, especially the support of the vast peasant masses, can you achieve your goal of striving for national liberation and your own liberation.

    Male and female workers! In cities under white terror, you must be good at using tactics flexibly to protect your own interests. Activists among the workers should go to all places where there are masses, even to trade unions and other organizations and institutions led by reactionary leaders, to organize the masses to defend their daily struggles for their own interests, such as opposing slave labor, opposing unfair treatment, and so on. In this way, you can accumulate strength, prepare strength, and wait for favorable opportunities to come, so that when the opportunity comes, you can organize large-scale mass movements and give the reactionary forces a powerful blow.

    Brothers and sisters who are being devastated and oppressed by imperialism, precisely because of the victory of the national liberation struggle in many Asian countries, especially the great victory of the Chinese people, the national liberation movements in many Asian regions will be greatly encouraged and will inevitably expand further. However, in some places where the forces of imperialism and its running dogs are still very strong, these reactionary demons will implement even more bloody terror policies in an attempt to eliminate all progressive forces. Therefore, it should be foreseen that the environment in which the laboring brothers in such countries and regions find themselves will temporarily become more serious. But as long as you understand everything mentioned above and are good at flexibly using it according to specific conditions, then the blows of the reactionary forces will not achieve their purpose, you will be able to avoid falling into the traps they have set, and you will eventually be able to unite the vast masses to carry out the struggle and gradually weaken the enemy. When the opportunity arrives, you will be able to create the conditions to completely annihilate the national enemy and achieve complete victory.

    The representative conference pointed out that imperialism and its running dogs are attempting to organize a reactionary united front to attack the democratic and peaceful forces in Asia. Therefore, it is extremely necessary for the working class and all oppressed people of Asian countries to unite to resist the attacks of reactionary forces. The representative conference calls on the working classes of all countries in the world, especially the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands, to give warm sympathy and all assistance to their brothers in oppressed countries. This is your sacred responsibility of internationalist solidarity.

    Laboring brothers of all Asian countries, in this struggle, you are not isolated, you can get the sympathy and support of laboring brothers all over the world. The World Federation of Trade Unions is a faithful protector of the interests of all oppressed people in Asia and a fighter for the cause of the liberation of the working class.

    The representative conference is pleased to report to you that the Asian Standing Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions has been established, and its task is to consolidate and strengthen the links between trade unions in Asian countries and between trade unions in Asian countries and the leading bodies of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    Long live the unity, friendship, and brotherly mutual assistance of the Asian working class and all laborers!

    Long live international workers' solidarity!

    Long live the independence, liberation, democratic freedom of the people of all nations!

　　亚洲澳洲工会代表会议的决议和宣言
    告亚洲各国工人和一切劳动者书
    【新华社北京一日电】“亚洲澳洲工会代表会议告亚洲各国工人和一切劳动者书”全文如下：
    亚洲各国男女劳动者们！
    兄弟们和姐妹们！
    我们，代表亚洲十四个国家千百万劳动者的亚澳工会代表会议的代表们，向你们致兄弟的敬礼！
    我们的代表会议是按照亚洲工人们的意志和愿望召开的，为了讨论如何巩固亚洲各国工会相互的联系以及与世界工人运动的联系，为了讨论我们国家一切劳动者所最关心的如何扫除帝国主义者对我们的压榨、如何争取民族的真正独立和人民的民主自由，如何改善劳动者的生活与达到完全解放的道路等问题。
    亚澳工会代表会议，已于本年十一月间在中国人民宣告成立的中华人民共和国的首都——北京，举行过了。
    代表会议以巨大的欣慰，指出中国人民获得伟大胜利的历史意义，这个胜利的获得，是由于中国工人阶级团结了一切反对帝国主义及其走狗的阶级、派别、团体和个人，组成民族统一战线，建立了由工人阶级领导的革命军队，在全体人民，首先是全体农民的拥护下，进行革命战争，击败了内部反动派和外国帝国主义联合力量的结果而达到的。
    代表会议代表亚洲劳动者热烈的祝贺中国工人阶级及整个英勇的中国人民，祝贺他们的人民共和国的成立。
    在劳动者已成了自己命运的主人的若干亚洲国家里，已经实现了和正在实现着巨大的民主改革。在中华人民共和国，在蒙古人民共和国，在朝鲜北部，已经一劳永逸地扫除了或正在扫除着帝国主义、封建主义的压迫和剥削，一切劳动者已经从奴隶地位变成国家社会的主人，已经能按照自己的意志去创造幸福的将来，已经实施或正在准备实施进步的劳动立法，实行同工同酬的原则，逐步改善劳动者的物质和文化生活。
    这些国家里民主的胜利，鼓舞着亚洲所有被压迫人民起来进行反对帝国主义殖民地的奴役制度的斗争。
    亚澳工会代表会议在北京的举行，乃是亚洲民主力量增长之明显证据。民主力量在全世界上正在日益增长着。世界和平民主的阵营，获得一切国家的老百姓的拥护。
    伟大的苏联是世界民主力量的领导者。它是所有劳动人民的希望和光明。苏联各族人民自由、平等及兄弟般友谊的伟大范例，具有全世界历史的意义。
    代表会议在祝贺亚洲已解放各民族的卓越成功时，要请一切劳动者特别注意亚洲各殖民地、半殖民地及附庸国家劳动者所遭受的残酷的压迫、无权的地位与非人的生活。代表会议完全暴露了帝国主义殖民者的残酷剥削。事实证明，被压迫国家劳动者遭受奴役和贫困的绞杀，应由资本主义负全部的责任。
    贪婪的帝国主义者，为了恢复和巩固对亚洲人民的统治，为了加强对他们的奴役，为了从他们身上榨取更多的利润，并寻求打开日益发展的经济危机的出路，他们正在加强对亚洲被压迫人民的经济、政治、军事的压力。英、法、荷帝国主义者在第二次世界大战中，曾答应和全世界爱好和平的人民并肩作战的亚洲各国人民，给他们以民族独立的权利，可是在战后，竟违反了这个诺言，用武装进攻去反对亚洲人民的民族解放运动？美国帝国主义则领导着这个镇压民族解放运动的进攻，并装备那些亚洲的反动力量。
    帝国主义这种野蛮残暴的掠夺行为，不能不引起被压迫的亚洲殖民地国家人民的坚决反抗，以保卫自己民族的独立，正如第二次世界大战中，法、荷、比人民武装，反抗侵略和奴役这些国家人民的法西斯侵略者一样。在亚洲许多被压迫国家里，如越南、马来亚、印尼、缅甸、菲律宾、朝鲜南部等国的人民群众，因受不住帝国主义的残暴压迫，正在进行武装反抗，建立了人民武装队伍，进行游击战争，并建立了或大或小的游击区和解放区，为反对帝国主义强盗及其走狗的进攻而进行残酷的斗争。特别是越南人民在反对法国殖民者的斗争中，已经取得了很大的胜利。
    代表会议的对于这些正在进行爱国斗争来反对帝国主义压迫的民族英雄们，表示无限的敬意。这种爱国斗争，由于正确的领导与全体人民的努力和不怕牺牲的结果，会终于达到民族解放的神圣目的。
    帝国主义害怕亚洲各国民族解放运动的发展会挖掉他们统治的基石，更加狂疯地对这些被压迫国家的人民实行残暴的镇压。除了派遣军队进攻这些国家的解放区和游击队外，并到处扶植反动势力，使这些国家中的民族叛徒在帝国主义武力保护下，建立起法西斯式的血腥统治。凡是他们统治的地方，都肆行白色恐怖，摧残一切民主工会及其他民主组织，压迫、拘捕甚至屠杀这些民主组织的领导者和积极分子。
    在英帝国主义者支配下的马来亚，禁止了马来亚工会联合会的活动，它的领导者维拉西兰和加纳帕西，被处死刑了。
    在印度尼西亚，仅在去年一年内，就有二万五千余爱国主义者和工会积极分子被投入狱中，印度尼西亚中央工会组织的领导者哈利诺、欧其华和达罗斯曼竟遭枪决了。
    在朝鲜南部，工人运动的卓越活动者——南朝鲜纺织工会副主席——权镇泽，劳动同盟主席团委员——刘亨植，都遇害了。
    在伊朗，有很多工会领导者被捕了，有八人被缺席判处死刑，其中包括有工会联合会中央委员会主席烈札、鲁斯达在内。
    在印度有几万个工人运动的及其他人民民主运动的积极参加者，被投入监狱。全印职工大会总书记——世界工联执行局委员唐其同志，未经审讯，被囚于狱中已有一年多了。全印职工大会所选举的出席第二届世界工会代表大会的代表均被逮捕了。
    在缅甸，许多民主团体遭到迫害，许多民主战士遭受拘捕，并且在集中营中经常遭受酷刑和屠杀。
    在泰国，民主力量受到由美帝国主义所支持的反动统治的迫害，他们不仅压迫民主工会，并且挑拨不同国籍和民族的工人之间的冲突，其目的在于削弱工人阶级日益增涨的团结。
    在日本，麦克阿瑟总部禁止民主工会的代表团出国，阻碍他们参加第二届世界工会代表大会和这次亚澳工会代表会议，指使日本反动政府用武装力量来压制工人运动。美国的坦克和机关枪被用来对付罢工的工人。
    同时帝国主义的代理人，美国劳工联合会、美国产业工会大会和英国职工大会的反动领导者们，都依照他们主子的命令，分裂各个国家中以及整个世界范围内的工人运动。他们在亚洲工人运动中，干着滔天的罪行，指使并勾结这些国家中的反动分子建立反动的警察的工会，并企图联合这些由警察领导的伪工会，来成立所谓亚洲劳动联盟，想以此来压抑亚洲劳动者们争取民族独立及自己生活权利和民主自由的斗争。
    代表会议号召亚洲各国工会和劳动人民为实现米兰第二次世界工会代表大会所通过的关于殖民地和半殖民地国家的决议中的各项原则而斗争：
    消灭作为帝国主义经济剥削范围的殖民地、保护国和附属国的制度。不分种族、肤色、国籍和信仰，发展工会组织。要求保护劳动的立法。反对任何基于种族、信仰或性别之不同而在社会、经济或政治方面有所歧视。要求在公私企业中实行同工同酬。要求废除反劳工法，要求取消奴隶劳动。为保护工人一切日常切身的经济和政治利益而斗争。
    代表会议代表亚洲千百万劳动者，坚决抗议帝国主义及其走狗在印度、日本、伊朗、朝鲜南部、缅甸、马来亚、印度尼西亚和亚洲其他被压迫国家里对工会和其他民主组织的摧残以及对这些民主组织的领导者的迫害。
    代表会议要求在这些国家内恢复民主的自由，特别是组织工会的自由，立刻释放监狱中的工人运动活动者和一切争取民族解放和民主自由的战士；并号召亚洲各国的工人们，坚决反对那些美国英国资本家走狗分裂工人组织的阴谋和行动，巩固自己的团结，不要受这些工人阶级叛徒们的欺骗。
    代表会议号召亚洲各被压迫国家的工人和全体人民对殖民者的武装进攻，实行坚决的抵抗，对于正在为保卫祖国独立自由而进行艰苦斗争的爱国志士，给以一切可能的支援。
    亚洲被压迫国家的工人们和工人运动者们！你们的代表在会议上说，当你们在白色恐怖统治的城市里不能工作的时候，你们就到游击区域去，参加游击队，在不断的斗争过程中扩大并加强工人阶级在这些人民武装队伍中的骨干和领导。代表会议欢迎这种爱国行动，它表明了工人们选择了如何英勇的道路，来扩大民族解放的斗争。
    亚洲各被压迫国家的工人和劳动者们！你们知道，你们的解放是与你们民族的解放分不开的。你们要争取到自己社会地位和劳动条件的根本改善，必须首先争取到民族的真正独立自主和整个人民群众的民主自由。你们应当成为民族解放斗争最勇敢、最坚决、最彻底的战士。你们应当主动地去团结一切被帝国主义及其走狗所压迫的广大的农民、知识分子、城市小资产阶级以及反对帝国主义的民族资产阶级、组成强大的民族统一战线，并使这个统一战线在你们的领导下去进行反对帝国主义及走狗的斗争。工农联盟是你们最终胜利的基本条件之一。只有你们的斗争真正获得全国一切反对帝国主义及其走狗的广大人民群众的拥护，特别是广大农民群众的拥护，才能达到你们争取民族解放和自己解放的目的。
    男工和女工们！在白色恐怖的城市里，你们要善于灵活地运用策略来保卫自己的利益。工人中的积极分子，要到一切有群众地方去，那怕是由反动首领所领导的工会及其他组织和机关中去进行工作，来组织群众保卫自己利益的日常斗争，如反对奴隶劳动，反对不公平的待遇等等。这样来积聚力量，准备力量，等候顺利时机的到来，以便在时机到来的时候，组织广大的群众运动，给反动势力以有力的打击。
    正在遭受帝国主义摧残压迫的劳动者兄弟姊妹们，正是由于亚洲许多国家中民族解放斗争的胜利，特别是中国人民的伟大胜利，对于许多亚洲地区的民族解放运动将会受到很大的鼓舞而必然更加扩大起来。但对于另一些在帝国主义及其走狗的势力还很强固的地方，这般反动的恶魔会要更加施行血腥恐怖的政策，企图消灭一切进步的力量。因此应当预见到，在这样的国家和地区中的劳动兄弟们所处的环境，暂时会更加严重起来。但是只要你们领会了上面所说的一切，善于根据具体条件去灵活的运用，那末，反动势力的打击就不会达到目的，你们就能避免陷入他们所设的陷阱，终于能够团结广大群众进行斗争，逐渐削弱敌人。当时机到了的时候，你们就能创造条件来彻底歼灭民族敌人，取得完全胜利。
    代表会议指出，帝国主义及其走狗正在企图组织反动的联合战线来向亚洲的民主和平力量进攻。因此亚洲各国工人阶级和一切被压迫人民团结一致来抵抗反动势力的进攻是万分必要的。代表会议号召全世界各国，特别是美、英、法、荷等国的工人阶级应当给被压迫国家的弟兄们以热烈的同情与一切的援助，这是你们国际主义团结的神圣的责任。
    亚洲各国劳动者弟兄们，在这个斗争中，你们不是孤立的，你们可以得到全世界劳动者兄弟的同情和支持。世界工会联合会是亚洲所有被压迫人民利益的忠实保护者和工人阶级解放事业的战士。
    代表会议很满意地报告你们，世界工联亚洲常设联络局成立了，它的任务是巩固并加强亚洲各国工会间以及亚洲各国工会与世界工联的领导机构之间的联系。
    亚洲工人阶级与全体劳动者的团结、友谊和兄弟般的互助万岁！
    国际工人团结万岁！
    各民族人民独立解放与民主自由万岁！
