　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: According to the Singapore Nanyang Siang Pau, Kuala Lumpur reports: The British colonial authorities in the Federation of Malaya have recently modified Article 17 of the so-called "Emergency Regulations" promulgated last June. The revised article stipulates that, in addition to the existing power to order the detention or deportation of residents at any time, those arrested may be "bailed" after paying a deposit. The amount of the deposit and the method of guarantee are to be determined by the British colonial authorities. However, the colonial authorities may, on the pretext of "failure to comply with the specified conditions," re-detain or deport those who have paid bail at any time. Therefore, this amended article has opened up a new avenue of extortion for the British colonial authorities in Malaya. According to official statistics quoted by the newspaper, 351 Malayan residents were arrested in the week of October 6th to 12th.

　　马来亚英殖民政府勒索居民
    【新华社北京十二日电】据新加坡南侨日报载吉隆坡讯：马来亚联邦英殖民地当局最近将去年六月公布的所谓“紧急条例”第十七条，加以修改。修正后的条文除了规定仍可随时下令拘留居民或驱逐出境外，并规定被捕者可在缴付保金后予以“保释”。保金的数目及具结的办法，则概由英殖民地当局订定。但殖民地当局对交保的人得以“未遵守指定条件”为借口，随时重行加以拘留或驱逐出境。因此这一修正条文给马来亚英国殖民地当局，开辟了一项新的勒索途径。另据该报引自官方的统计，在十月六日至十二日的一周间，马来亚居民被逮捕者即达三百五十一人。
