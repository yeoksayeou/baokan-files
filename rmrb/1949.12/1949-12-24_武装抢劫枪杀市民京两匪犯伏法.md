　　Armed Robbery and Murder of Citizens: Two Criminals Executed in Beijing
　　[Beijing News] Based on the investigation and prosecution by the Beijing Public Security Bureau, the Military Tribunal of the Beijing Military Control Commission held a military trial for the bandits Wang Wenmao and Shi Hongda, who colluded to rob people's property and shoot innocent people. They were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on December 23. Accomplices in the case, Liu Hongsheng and Li Guoliang, were sentenced to seven years and one year of imprisonment, respectively.
　　The bandit Wang Wenmao organized two armed robberies. On March 15, while robbing Sun Menglin's home, he shot and killed Sun's wife, Mrs. Sui. The bandit Shi Hongda (also known as Guo Zhiyun and Guo Chongde) continuously fired his gun and injured the victim Yang Ziqiang's right arm during a robbery on March 6.
　　These bandits had committed numerous atrocities and oppressed the people before liberation. After liberation, they remained unrepentant and instead organized armed robberies and shot citizens. During the trial, they were extremely cunning. The Military Tribunal of the Municipal Military Control Commission sentenced the main criminals Wang Wenmao and Shi Hongda to death in accordance with the law. The fugitives Zhang Yu and Wang Huaiyu will be dealt with separately after their arrest.

　　武装抢劫枪杀市民京两匪犯伏法
    【北京讯】京市军事管制委员会军法处根据市公安局的侦审结果与公诉，对结伙抢劫人民财物、枪杀事主的匪徒王文茂、史鸿达等举行军事审判并判处死刑，于本月二十三日执行枪决。各案从犯刘鸿升、李国良等分别处有期徒刑七年及一年。

    这些匪犯在解放前就作恶多端，欺压人民；解放后，仍执迷不悟，反而组织武装抢劫，并枪杀市民，审理中复狡猾异常，市军管会军法处依法将各案主犯王文茂、史鸿达判处死刑。逃犯张瑜、王怀玉待获案后另结。
