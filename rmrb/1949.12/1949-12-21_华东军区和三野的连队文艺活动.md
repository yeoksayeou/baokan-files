Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 19th - Cultural workers of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army have spent the past two months deep among the companies, extensively carrying out mass cultural activities, promoting the various tasks of the units. When they studied the resolutions of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in late September and first went down to the companies, many company-level cadres were afraid that cultural work would not take off; most soldiers also felt that "illiterates have no way." Therefore, they first organized soldiers to discuss "Can illiterates really write and perform plays?" to dispel the soldiers' concerns ideologically; at the same time, they actively taught them to read music, sing songs, perform rhythmic storytelling, teach them to read, recite lines, rehearse plays, and organize company-level get-togethers. Later, they further promoted "real people playing real events," collectively discussing actual materials that could cooperate with the central tasks of the company, collectively writing scripts, and revising and reviewing them during rehearsals. After the performance of such plays, they were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of commanders and fighters, strengthening their confidence in participating in cultural work. For example, when a guard unit of a military region was training, they performed "Wang Guixuan is proud, only seven rings out of three shots." Wang Guixuan himself played Wang Guixuan, performing very vividly. The soldiers who watched said, "Wang Guixuan has a lisp and doesn't know a single character, but he can perform, so we can all perform." Many soldiers went to the cultural officer and asked: "If there are any more plays, save a role for me." The plays written in this way can indeed educate the troops and promote work. In a certain military's shooting practice, some complacent soldiers got "sesame cakes" (meaning zero points), while those who usually practiced diligently did well. The soldiers then wrote "Next Time, Watch Me." This play clearly contrasted the two typical examples of failure and success. Some soldiers said after watching: "He's acting like me! This time it's just my own fault for not working hard enough. Next time, watch me." When a guard unit of a certain military region performed "Where Did the Gun Go?", the soldiers shouted "Oppose sloppy work style" at the most tense moment.

When work was tense, rhythmic storytelling replaced acting. One day, when a certain unit was training, there was a sudden downpour, freezing everyone. So the soldiers wrote rhythmic storytelling themselves: "Comrades, our determination is strong, floating in the ocean in the heavy rain; the sounds of songs and waves are indistinguishable, the sea avoids us on both sides. This kind of spirit is really fierce, there is no resistance when attacking Taiwan!" The rhythmic storytelling encouraged everyone's emotions.

In addition to acting and rhythmic storytelling, there were also "homemade lanterns" and "flashlight filmstrips" drawn by the soldiers themselves, as well as boat poems, lantern poems, and gun poems, which were all welcomed by the broad masses of commanders and fighters.

In this way, cultural activities became effective political education, which aroused the attention of commanders of various units to cultural work, regarding it as an important part of political work. Some company-level cadres said: "Your rhythmic storytelling and short plays have a greater effect than my lectures." Since then, many soldier theater troupes have been established in various units. Some battalion political instructors concurrently served as the heads of the soldier theater troupes, and many battalion and company-level cadres personally wrote scripts, directed, or participated in performances. Within two months, a certain military organized eighty soldier theater troupes, cultivated 1,670 outstanding soldier actors, held 411 evening parties, and performed 398 programs. A guard unit of a certain military region wrote 108 scripts within two months. Among these scripts, a one-act play "Take a Look at Our Squad Leader" by a certain military showed the deep class love of the People's Army and was welcomed by the entire army. A certain division created "Military Dance" based on the four major movements of soldiers: bayonet fighting, shooting, throwing grenades, and digging fortifications, which was also warmly welcomed by commanders and fighters.

The CCP committees at all levels in the troops gave a lot of encouragement and support to the development of company-level cultural movements. The Shandong Military Region held cultural and entertainment competitions to encourage cultural activities. Soldier theater troupes from various troops traveled long distances to Jinan to participate, and many theater troupes won awards. Many units, based on the opinions of all personnel, used the money left over from food expenses to buy musical instruments, curtains, and other performance equipment.

However, there are still individual units that do not pay enough attention to cultural work. In the soldier theater troupes that have already been organized, some organizations are still relatively loose, and there is a tendency for some theater troupes to entertain for the sake of entertainment and to pursue trophyism. There are more scripts about the transformation of backward elements and fewer scripts praising advanced elements. Therefore, some people reflect: "There are so many backward elements." These shortcomings will be gradually corrected in the future broader mass company-level cultural movement.

### 华东军区和三野的连队文艺活动

　　华东军区和三野的连队文艺活动
    华东军区和第三野战军各部文艺工作者，两月来深入连队，广泛地开展连队群众性的文艺活动，推动了部队各项的工作。当他们在九月下旬学习了全国文学艺术工作者代表大会决议，刚下连队的时候，很多连队干部害怕文艺工作搞不起来；一般战士也觉得“大老粗没办法”。于是，他们首先组织战士讨论“大老粗到底能不能写戏，演戏？”从思想上打消了战士的顾虑；同时积极教他们读乐谱，学唱歌，说快板，教他们识字，读台词，排戏，组织营连同乐晚会。以后更进一步提倡“真人演真事”，由战士们自己集体讨论，选择能配合连队中心任务的实际材料，集体编写剧本，在排演中修改，审查。这类剧本演出以后，受到广大指战员的热烈欢迎，坚定了他们参加文艺工作的信心。如某军区警卫部队在练兵中演出“王贵轩骄傲，三枪只七环”，扮演王贵轩的就是王贵轩本人，演得非常生动。战士们看了都说：“王贵轩是短舌子，一个大字不识，他能演，我们也都能演”。很多战士找到文化干事要求：“再演戏，给我留个脚色”。这样编出来的戏，确实能够教育部队，推进工作。某军在练习打靶中，有些自满的战士吃了“烧饼”（零分的意思），而平时虚心苦练的，却都打得不错。战士们就编了“下次看我的”。在这个戏里明确地对比了失败和成功的两种典型，有的战士看后说：“他演的就是我呀！这次只怪我自己不努力，下次看我的。”某军区警卫部队演出“枪到那里去了”，演到最紧张的时候，战士们就高呼：“反对马虎作风”。
    在工作紧张的时候，快板就代替了演剧。某部有一天在练兵时，忽然大雨倾盆，冻得大家发抖，于是战士们就自己编起快板来：“同志们，决心强，大雨之中飘海洋；歌声浪声分不开，海水见了避两傍。这种气概真猛壮，打到台湾没有抵挡！”快板声鼓舞了大家的情绪。
    除演戏快板外，还有战士自编自画的“土幼灯”、“电筒打的幼灯片”，和船头诗、灯笼诗、枪杆诗等，都受到广大指战员的欢迎。
    这样，文艺活动成了有效的政治教育，也就引起了各部指挥员对文艺工作的重视，把它看成政治工作重要内容之一。有些营连干部说：“你们编快板，排小戏，比我上课讲话的效果还大。”各部队从此陆续建立了许多战士剧团，有的营教导员兼了战士剧团的团长，不少营、连干部都亲自编剧本，作导演或参加演出。某军两个月内组织了八十个战士剧团，培养了出色的战士演员一千六百七十人，举行晚会四百一十一次，演出节目三百九十八个。某军区警备部队两个月内编了一百零八个剧本。这些剧本中，某军的独幕剧“看看咱班长”，表现了人民军队深切的阶级友爱，受到全军的欢迎。某师依据战士刺枪、射击、投弹、挖工事四大动作，创造了“军人舞”，也受到指战员热烈欢迎。
    部队中的中共各级党委对于开展连队文艺运动，给了很多的鼓励和支持。山东军区为鼓励文艺活动，曾举行文化娱乐竞赛，各地部队战士剧团都远道赶到济南参加，不少剧团获奖。很多单位根据全体人员的意见把伙食剩余的钱买了乐器、布幕等演戏用具。
    但是，目前也还有个别单位对文艺工作没有足够重视。在已经组织的战士剧团中，有些组织还比较散漫，有个别剧团还存在为娱乐而娱乐和锦标主义的偏向。剧本写落后分子转变的较多，表扬先进分子的较少。因此有人反映：“那里有这样多的落后分子”。这些缺点将在今后更广泛的群众性的连队文艺运动中，逐渐加以纠正。
