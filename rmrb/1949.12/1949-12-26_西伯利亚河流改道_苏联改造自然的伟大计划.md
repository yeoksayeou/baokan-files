　　Siberian River Diversion
    ——A Great Soviet Plan to Transform Nature
    By Romasikov, translated by Hai Cheng
    The People's Daily published on November 19th that the Soviet Union is using atomic energy to execute an unprecedented plan to transform nature in human history. This plan is to divert the bottom waters of two major Siberian rivers, the Ob and the Yenisei, so that part of the water flows through the desert area of the Turan Lowland in Central Asia, turning the original barren land into fertile arable land. At the same time, it will eliminate the source of dry winds, which used to cross the Caspian Sea and attack the South Russian Plain, causing droughts in the Volga and Don River basins nine years out of ten. In addition, this plan will open up a navigation route directly from northern Siberia to the Caspian Sea, and obtain an inestimable amount of hydropower. The completion of this plan will make the lives of the Soviet people more prosperous.
    This article is translated from the February issue of the Soviet science magazine "Knowledge is Power," originally titled: "The Rivers of Siberia Will Flow into the Aral Sea." What is described here is only a plan. This plan has now begun to be implemented.
    —Translator
    East of the Caspian Sea lies a vast, but extremely water-scarce land, known as the Turan Lowland. If it were placed on a map of Europe, it would cover most of it. Three deserts are distributed here: the Kara-Kum, Kyzyl-Kum, and Betpak-Dala, whose scorching breath contributes to the generation of ferocious dry winds.
    Soviet scientists have long thought about how to turn this arid land into a garden of vibrant colors, and how to launch an attack on the source of dry winds.
    Such a grand task seems beyond human capabilities: it requires greatly changing the climate and geographical features of a huge area of our motherland. It requires forcing nature to bring abundant rain here during the hot season of the year, whereas now there is only an endlessly blue sky in summer, and the meager rainfall mainly occurs in winter, when it is of no importance to crops.
    It is necessary to create new, powerful rivers, to let their water flow through the desert lands, and to irrigate them with their water. A Yusahe proverb says: "Where the water stops, the soil stops." The most fertile land, if it is arid, is of no value, because the nutrients it contains cannot reach the roots of plants in a dry state.
    The water of the rivers that now flow into the Aral Sea is clearly not enough to irrigate all these areas. Even if, assuming that all the water from the two major arteries of the Aral Sea basin—the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya—were used for irrigation, stopping the water from flowing into the Aral Sea and letting the Aral Sea dry up, then the amount of irrigated land could be increased to about twice as much. But even in this case, there would still be many millions of hectares of fertile land that would not be utilized, and the irrigated area would only account for about eight percent of all arable land.
    If water could be supplied to the vast area east of the Caspian Sea, and millions of hectares of irrigated and greened land could evaporate billions of tons of moisture, it might then be possible to satisfy the thirst of the dry winds, thereby facilitating and accelerating the work of forest defense belts.
    But how to accomplish all this? Where can the enormous energy be obtained to change the direction of air currents and guide rain-bearing clouds towards the desert? How can glaciers be created in the mountains to nourish new rivers? Since the beginning of human existence, no one has dared to even imagine such a task. For centuries, the Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Turkmen have labored, taking meager water to irrigate their fields. For centuries, the farmers of the Volga River basin have sown crops, looking at the sky with hope and fear, while nature has sometimes shown itself to be gratuitously generous, and sometimes wrathful and gratuitously cruel to all of them.
    But can it be said that the Soviets have not entered into a struggle with nature, and that they have not become victors in such a struggle? The waterway linking the White Sea and the Baltic Sea, the subjugation of the turbulent Dnieper River, the Magnitogorsk iron ore in the blast furnaces of the Urals and Kuzbass, the flowering apple trees of Siberia, winter sowing seeds and spring sowing,—are not all these victories over nature? The whole thing is only in the scale of the work, and now in our country this depends on the tenacity, courage, and diligence of people. But can it be said that the Soviets lack such qualities?
    The experienced hydraulic engineer Davidov thought so. He had worked on irrigation in Central Asia for many years, and he had personally recognized the drought here for many years. For him, an engineer educated in the Bolshevik spirit, it was very clear: any task that helps consolidate the Soviet economy can and must be completed, no matter how difficult, even if it is utopian. But the Soviet engineers did not use the method of creating new glaciers and changing air currents to determine the completion of the task.
    Davidov remembered a very interesting feature of the Turan Lowland—it is one of the rarest places on the Earth's surface, because most of it, the part adjacent to the Caspian Sea, is below sea level.
    It is this feature—the low-lying terrain of the Turan Lowland—that the Soviet engineers decided to use to solve all the problems.
    Let's look at the map.
    We unfold the map of the Soviet Union, and we will see that in the northeast of the Turan Lowland, in the vast land of Western Siberia, flow two huge, water-rich rivers—the Ob and the Yenisei.
    In terms of drainage area, they are among the world's top ten rivers—the Ob River ranks fifth, and the Yenisei River ranks seventh. The flow of the two rivers accounts for slightly less than a quarter of the total river flow in the Soviet Union. If the annual flow of the Ob and Yenisei Rivers were all poured into railway water tankers, it would form a train as long as 190 million kilometers!
    The map also shows us an interesting detail. The watershed between the Ob River basin and the Aral Sea basin is a high ground, which is divided into two parts by a very narrow and deep corridor. In the middle of this corridor, at a distance of twenty or thirty kilometers from each other, are the sources of two rivers: one is the Ubogan River, a tributary of the Ob River, and the other is the Turgay River, which flows in a southern direction towards the Aral Sea. This corridor is called the Turgay Gate or Ubogan-Turgay Valley, and it runs directly from the water-rich Ob River basin to the water-scarce Turan Lowland.
    All of this clearly tells the experienced hydraulic engineer Davidov that the Ob River can just lend some water to the Turan Lowland, and the shortest route is through the Turgay Gate.
    The geological history of the Turgay Gate is very interesting. In ancient times—the Tertiary Period, the West Siberian Plain was a sea, and the Ubogan-Turgay Valley was a strait: this strait connected the Siberian Sea and the Tethys Sea, which submerged the current Caspian Sea, the South Russian Plain, the Black Sea, and the modern Mediterranean Sea. After several thousand years, powerful internal forces stirred the crust of the young planet. Land rose from the sea, and the Siberian Sea of the Tertiary Period retreated northward. At that time, two rivers flowed on the land—the ancient Ob and Yenisei. But powerful glaciers came from the north, which blocked these rivers. They turned back and opened up new roads along the former strait, towards the Aral Sea and the Caspian Sea.
    Later (already in the Quaternary Period), the glaciers melted. The orogenic processes continued, and there was such a moment: the Turgay Gate rose above the water surface. Nature "closed the door," and the river water, in search of a way out, turned north again, flowing towards the Kara Sea along the slope of the Siberian Plain that was freed from the ice.
    The passage to the south, although closed, still remains. Along this passage, two rivers flow in different directions from the earliest point in the middle of the passage, namely the Ubogan and Turgay rivers that we have already mentioned, and in some places there are also some small, bitter salt lakes scattered. The length of this corridor is 930 kilometers. If the highest part is deepened and a canal is dug here, then the road that water once followed from Siberia to the Caspian Sea will be reopened.
    Taking water from Siberia and forcing it to flow to Central Asia, this is how the bold outline of this project was drawn up.
    The concept, almost a fantastic concept, needs research and numbers to prove its value.

    Rebuilding the Ancient Siberian Sea
    If a dam of about 70 meters high is set up on the Ob River, below the confluence of the Irtysh River, then the water level raised by it will reach above the Ob, Irtysh, Tobol rivers and their tributaries, and closely reach the Turgay Gate. A huge reservoir will be formed (it will be called the Ob Reservoir), with a water area of about 250,000 square kilometers, and an approximate volume of 4,500 cubic kilometers.
    This will be the largest artificial reservoir in the world. But even among naturally formed reservoirs, it, created by human hands, is only inferior to the Caspian Sea.
    In terms of area, the Aral Sea will be four times smaller than it, and Lake Baikal eight times smaller. The places submerged by it are mostly deserts, mostly covered by forests, shrubs, and swamps.
    Based on the complete solution of this problem, we see the re-emergence of the Siberian Sea of the Tertiary Period that existed millions of years ago. Although smaller in scale and different in nature, the sea created by human hands is now fresh water and will work for socialism.

    Waterway from Siberia to the Caspian Sea
    The threshold of the Turgay Gate is only 50 meters higher than the water level of the Ob Reservoir. In order to "open" the gate, as we have already said, it is necessary to excavate a canal and chisel through this threshold. The water of Siberia will obtain a free exit through the canal, pass through the Turgay River, Lake Chalkar-Tengiz, and the low-lying Kara-Kum Desert near the Aral Sea, and directly enter the Aral Sea, irrigating the desert lands along its path.
    In Davidov's design, the Aral Sea is a reservoir. The winter water flow, when the irrigation system is not needed, will accumulate here. But how can the Aral Sea be turned into a freshwater reservoir?
    After the Siberian water fills the Aral Sea and raises its water level, the water of the Aral Sea will then flow according to the natural slope of the terrain, and will eventually flow into the Caspian Sea. The Aral Sea will become living water. The Siberian water will gradually drain out the saltwater from the Aral Sea, washing it, and turning it into a freshwater reservoir. Of course, along with the water, the animal life of the Aral Sea will change. Perhaps, after it becomes freshwater, it will be migrated by Siberian fish, and the local fish will adapt to the new living and nutritional conditions, and change their appearance. Here, a very interesting task is put forward for biologists—to study the impact of the environment on organisms.
    The following is the road that the water flowing out of the Aral Sea will take: according to the natural slope of the terrain, along the connecting canal, the water will flow into the Sarykamysh Depression. After filling it, it will create a second intermediate reservoir. Water ponds of some irrigation systems will be distributed here. The depression will become a freshwater lake, and on its shores and at its bottom will begin to form new flora and fauna that are novel to these places that have always been deserts.
    Between the Sarykamysh Depression and the Caspian Sea, there extends an ancient, now dried-up riverbed of the Uzboy River, almost 800 kilometers long. It will accept the Siberian water surface and bring it to the Caspian Sea.
    The Sarykamysh Depression, the Uzboy, and the Caspian Sea are all lower than the water surface of the world's oceans. The Caspian Sea surface is 25 meters lower than the Baltic Sea surface, and sometimes even lower, which is very interesting. Precisely because of this, the water from the Aral Sea to the Caspian Sea will be free-flowing.

    Hydropower
    After accumulating water to create irrigation reservoirs, hydraulic engineers are always planning to not use the energy of waterfalls. Five hydroelectric power stations will be built on the Ob River, at the Turgay Gate, and on the Uzboy River.
    The height to which the dam blocks the water and the amount of water make it possible for us to determine the power of these hydroelectric power stations with such a magnificent number—about ten million kilowatts.
    It is not necessary to use the energy where there are power stations: energy can be transmitted to hundreds of kilometers away by conductors. Russian electrical scholars discovered this possibility in the last century. Let's take another look at the map and see where this electrical energy will be transmitted: to the Urals, to Kazakhstan.
    The Eastern metal smelting industry, the Karabogaz chemical industry, and the oil production areas of Koppeh Dagh will obtain huge amounts of electrical energy from these future hydroelectric power stations. This great prospect is impossible to exaggerate.

    Ob Dam—Double-Outlet Faucet
    In the shower room, we often see double-outlet faucets, which release water into the bathtub or into the showerhead at will. The Ob Dam will work like this faucet. It divides the water into two directions: downward, through the turbines of the hydroelectric power station, northward to the Kara Sea, and into the reservoir for sending water to Central Asia.
    The Ob River flows an average of 10,000 cubic meters of water per second to the dam. The hydroelectric power station uses 9,000 cubic meters of it. Then, only 1,000 cubic meters of water is left to fill the "bathtub"—the reservoir. This is too little, because a lot of water is needed to irrigate the Turan Lowland. That is to say, it is necessary to look for another water source near the Ob River.
    Parallel to the Ob River, separated only by a flat watershed, flows the Yenisei River. It is as water-rich as its neighbor. It makes sense to install a dam on the Yenisei River to supplement the water spent from the Ob Reservoir to generate energy.
    The water surface of the Yenisei Reservoir will be 35 meters higher than the water surface of the Ob Reservoir. After the water level is raised, the water will fill the river valley of the Bukas River (a tributary of the Yenisei River), and then pass through the watershed canal into the Keti River (a tributary of the Ob River).
    The water flow of the Yenisei River will transport 9,000 cubic meters of water per second to the Ob Reservoir through the canal between the Bukas and Keti, and put 1,000 cubic meters into the turbines of the Yenisei Hydroelectric Power Station. The underwater waterfalls between Keti and the Ob Reservoir will also be utilized—another hydroelectric power station will be built here.
    The new hydroelectric power station will guarantee the supply of cheap energy to the Kuzbass and Novosibirsk industrial centers.
    Another task will also be solved. Millions of cubic meters of valuable timber can be transported out of the Siberian forests. Cheap energy will create the full possibility of unusually developing the logging industry. The amount of these wood fibers will be enough to guarantee most of the world's paper use.

    Igarka-Maku Route
    Setting up sluice gates along the river channels of the Ob and Yenisei Rivers is not only for obtaining electrical energy, but also for creating deep water to communicate transportation between the Kara Sea and the Caspian Sea. Sea-going vessels will be able to load timber, furs, and other raw materials from Dudinka, from Igarka, from Ust-Port, and from the new port of the Ob Reservoir to Maku, and return with oil, tea, rice, and fruits, and can also collect Ural metals and light industrial products from Central Asia along the way. This route will be more than 5,000 kilometers long per trip. Its start and end will be like this: Igarka—Tobolsk—Aralsk—Krasnovodsk—Baku. (Attached picture)

　　西伯利亚河流改道
    ——苏联改造自然的伟大计划
    罗玛式科夫作  海澄译
    十一月十九日人民日报刊载，苏联正用原子能执行一个人类历史上空前的改造自然计划，这个计划就是把西伯利亚两条大河——鄂毕、叶尼塞底水流改道，使其一部水流经中亚细亚底图郎低地沙漠区，使原来的不毛之地变成丰饶的可耕地。同时它还消灭掉旱风底发源。这个旱风，原来经常越过里海，袭击南俄平原，以致造成伏尔加河、顿河流域十年九旱。除此以外，这个计划的结果，还打通了从西伯利亚北边直通里海的航线，并取得难以估计的大量水电。这个计划底完成将使苏联人民底生活更为充裕。
    这篇文章译自苏联科学杂志“知识即力量”二月号，原题作：“西伯利亚的河流将流入咸海”。这里所描写的还只是一个计划。这个计划现在已经开始执行了。
    ——译者
    里海以东，横着一片巨大的、但却极其缺水的土地，那就是以图朗低地之名著称的土地。假使将它放置在欧洲地图上，它将遮盖得住它的大部分。这里分布着三个沙漠：喀拉库姆、肯怎儿库姆、别特巴克达尔，它们底炽热的呼吸，促成凶残的旱风底产生。
    苏维埃的科学家们老早就想，怎样把这片干涸的土地变成千紫万红的花园，怎样向旱风产生的发源地展开攻袭。
    这样宏大的任务似乎是人力所不能达到的：须要大大改变我们祖国巨大地区的气候及地理面貌。须要强使自然在一年的热天在这里降下丰富的雨来，而现在这里夏天时只有万里无云的青天，可怜的一点雨量主要是在冬天降下，这时它们对农作是了无重要的。
    须要创造新的、强大的河川，让它们的水流经荒漠的土地，并以其水灌溉它们。愉萨赫谚语说：“水断在那儿，土断在那儿。”最肥沃的土地，要是它是干涸的话，任何价值都没有，因为在它里面包含的营养物质在干的状态下不能及于植物的根的。
    现在注入咸海的河流，其水旦显然是不够来灌溉所有这些区域的。即使是，假定把咸海盆地底两条大动脉——阿姆河和锡尔河——流水的全部拿来浇地，止掉水之注入咸海，让咸海干掉，那么灌溉田地的数量可以增大到约两倍。但就在这样情形下，还有许多许多万公顷的沃土未能被利用，而灌溉面积对全部可耕土地来说只不过占百分之八而已。
    假使能供给里海以东广大地区以水，数百万公顷灌溉的和绿化的田地能进行蒸发数十亿吨的潮润，可能，那时就能够满足旱风的干渴，从而便利了并加速了森林防御带的工作。
    但这一切如何作成呢？从那儿能弄来巨大的能量来改变气流的走向并把含雨的云引向沙漠呢？怎样能在山里创造冰河来滋养新的河流呢？从人类存在的时候起，未有谁敢于甚至是设想这样的任务。千百年中乌兹别克人、达吉克人、吐谷曼人辛劳着，取来贫乏的水来浇自己的田地，千百年中伏尔加河流域的农夫播下庄稼，带着希望和恐惧张望天空，而自然对所有他们，一下表现是无缘无故地多恩多惠，一下又是暴怒的，无缘无故地残忍。
    但难道说苏维埃人没有走入同自然的斗争吗，他们不是在这样的斗争中成为胜利者吗？联接白海和波罗的海的水道，制服波浪汹涌的聂伯河，乌拉尔和库兹巴斯鼓风炉中的马格尼陶果尔矿砂，西伯利亚开花的苹果树，冬莳种籽春天播下，——难道这一切不是对自然的胜利么？全部的事情只是在于工作的规模，而现在在我们国家里这是赖于人之顽强、勇敢、勤劳的。但难道说苏维埃人缺少这样的品质么？
    饶有经验的水利工程师达维多夫曾这样想。他曾在中亚细亚搞灌溉工作多年，他亲眼认识到这里多少年来的干渴。对于他，布尔塞维克教养的工程师，这是非常清楚的：任何任务，只要有助于巩固苏维埃经济，都能够而且必须完成，也不管它是如何困难，以至是空想的也好。但苏维埃工程师却不是用创造新冰河的方法，改变气流的方法决定完成任务的。
    达维多夫想起了图郎低地最有趣的一个特点——它是我们地球地表上最稀罕的地方之一，因为它的大部分，毗连于里海的部分，在海洋水平面以下。
    就是这样个特点——图朗低地的卑下形势——苏维埃工程师决定用之以解决全部的问题。
    让我们看看地图
    我们展开苏联地图，我们将看到在图朗低地的东北，在西西伯利亚广阔土地上流着两条巨大的水量充足的河流——鄂毕和叶尼塞。
    按流域面积来讲，它们位在世界十大河流里面——鄂毕河占第五位，叶尼塞河占第七位。两河的水流量为苏联全部河流水流量的四分之一稍弱。假使把鄂毕、叶尼塞尔河全年水流都灌入铁道水车里，那么就弄成长达一亿九千万公里原一付列车哩！
    地图还表明给我们一点有趣的细节。鄂毕河流域与咸海盆地的分水岭是一块高地，这块高地被一条很窄很深的走廊分成两部，在这条走廊的中间，相距离二三十公里，有两条河流的发源地：一条是鄂毕河的支流邬巴甘河，另一条是土尔阶河，它却是流向南方向着咸海的方向的。这条走廊称作土尔阶门或邬巴甘，土尔阶河谷，它从多水的鄂毕河流域直通到乏水的图朗低地。
    所有这一切清楚地告诉富有经验的水工学者达维多夫，刚刚是鄂毕河可以借给图朗低地一点儿水，而这个最短的路便是经过土尔阶门。
    土尔阶门的地质史是很有趣的。在古昔的时候——第三纪，西西伯利亚平原是一个海，而邬巴甘——土尔阶河谷是一条海峡：这条海峡贯通着西伯利亚海和大地中海，那个大地中海淹浸着现在的里海，南俄平原，黑海，及现代的地中海。经过了若干千年，强大的内部力量冲动了年青行星的地壳，从海里崛起了陆地，第三纪的西伯利亚海退向北方，在陆地上那时流着两条河——古代的鄂毕和叶尼塞。但强大的冰河自北方袭来，它潴塞住这些河流，它们就倒回了头，顺着以前的海峡，向着咸海和里海方面开拓了新的道路。
    又往后来（已是第四纪），冰河融解了。造山的过程则仍在继续，还有那么个时刻：土尔阶门升起了，高于水面以上。自然“关起了门”，河水为找寻流出的道路，便又折转向北，顺着从冰下解放出来的西伯利亚平原底倾斜面，流向喀拉海。
    向南方的通道，虽是封闭了，但还残存着。顺着这个通道，从位在通道中间的最早点，向不同的方向流下两条河，就是我们已经说过的邬巴甘和土尔阶，另外则在若干地方还散布着些微小的味苦的盐湖。这条走廊的长度为九百三十公里，如果把最高的部分挖深，在这里掘开一条运河，那么某时水曾从西伯利亚流到里海所遵循的道路，便重新辟开了。
    从西伯利亚取水并强使之流向中亚细亚，这样个工程决定就是这样被勾出概括的胆大的轮廓的。
    构思，几乎是幻想的构思，这需要研究及数字来证明它存在底价值。
    重建古西伯利亚海
    如果在鄂毕河上，额尔齐斯河入口以下，设置一个高约七十公尺的水坝，那么由于它而升高了的水平面将在鄂毕、额尔齐斯、托波尔诸河及它们的支流以上，并紧紧地达到土尔阶门、将形成一个巨大的水库（它将称作鄂毕水库），其水面积将有约二十五万平方公里，大概的容积将有四千五百立方公里。
    这将是全世界最大的人工水库。但即使是在天然形成的水库中间，用人底双手创造的它，变仅仅亚于里海而已。
    依面积说，咸海将较它小四倍，贝加尔湖小八倍。由它淹浸的地方则都是荒漠的，大部分是森林、灌木丛以及沼泽所漫没着。
    基于这个问题底全部底解决，我们便看到，存在于几百万年以前的第三纪西伯利亚泫底再出。虽说规模较小，性质相异。用人底双手的创造的现在这个海，将是淡水的，并将为社会主义而工作。
    从西伯利亚到里海的水道
    土尔阶门的门坎将只高于鄂毕水库的水平面总不过五十公尺。为要“打开”大门，如我们已说过的，便必得开掘运河，凿通这道门坎。西伯利亚的的水经过运河将获得自由的出路，经过土尔阶河，柴喀、腾吉兹湖及卑下的咸海附近的喀拉，库姆沙漠而直入咸海，并灌溉了它经过道途上的荒漠的土地。
    在达维多夫的设计里，咸海是一个水库。冬天的水流，那时灌溉的系统并不需要，将潴汇于此。但是咸海怎样能变成淡水底水库？
    西伯利亚的水注满了咸海，提高了它的水平以后，那时咸海的水便依照地形自然倾斜面而流动，最终便将流入里海。咸海将成为活水了。西伯利亚的水将逐渐地从咸海排出去咸水，洗涤它，而将它变成淡水水库。当然，同水一道，咸海的动物界变将变化。可能，它谈水化之后，将为西伯利亚的鱼类所徙居，而本地的鱼类将适应新的生活及营养条件，而改变其外貌。这里便为生物学者提出一个饶有兴味的任务——研究环境对生物的影响。
    以下是从咸海流出的水所要走的道路：按照地形的自然倾斜面，顺着联系运河，水将流入萨雷喀莓式洼地，将其注满以后，便造成了第二个中间水库。这里将分布些灌溉系统的水塘。洼地将成为淡水湖，在其岸上及其水底将开始形成对这些从来是荒漠的地方新颖的植物界并动物界。
    从萨雷喀莓式洼地到里海中间，延伸着一条古老的现已干掉了的乌兹波河底河道几乎有八百公里。它将接受西伯利亚的水面将它带到里海。
    萨雷喀莓式洼地、乌兹波、以及里海都低于世界海洋的水面。里海水面比波罗的海水面低二十五公尺，有时且更低，这是很有趣的。正由于此，从咸海到里海的水将是自流的。
    水力
    为了创立灌溉水库而把水潴集以后，水利工程师便时时企划不去利用瀑布底能。在鄂毕河，在土尔阶门，及在乌兹波河上将建设五个水力发电站。
    水坝把水挡起的高度及水量，使我们可能以这样宏伟的数字——约一千万千瓦——来决断这些水力发电站的威力。
    并不一定要在有发电站的地方来用去能：能可以导体传递到几百公里以外。俄国的电工学者还在上一世纪就揭开这个可能性了。我们再看一看地图，将看到这个电能将往何处传递：向乌拉尔，向卡查赫斯坦。
    东方底金属冶炼业、喀拉布加兹底化学工业、柯柏、达格底石油产地将自这些未来的水电站获得巨量的电能，这个伟大的远景是夸说不尽的。
    鄂毕水坝——双口龙头
    在淋浴浴室里我们常见到双口龙头，随自己的便或放水到浴盆，或放水到喷头。鄂毕水坝将象这样龙头一样工作。它把水分成两个方向：向下经过水电站的涡轮往北到喀拉海，及进入为向中亚送水的水库。
    鄂毕河平均每秒钟流到水坝一万立方公尺的水。这里面水电站应用去九千立方公尺。则是注满“浴盆”——水库——的水便只剩下一千立方公尺了。这太少了，因为灌溉图朗低地所需的水要很多很多。就是说，必须在鄂毕河附近找寻另外的水原。
    和鄂毕河并列，中间只隔着平坦的分水岭，流着叶尼塞河。它之水量充足，如同它的邻人一样。为补充从鄂毕水库支出以产生能的水，在叶尼塞河上装置水坝便有意义了。
    叶尼塞水库的水面将较鄂毕水库水面高出三十五公尺。水位提高之后，水将注满布喀斯河（叶尼塞支流）底河谷，再经过分水岭运河通入开奇河（鄂毕河支流）。
    叶尼塞河的水流，将通过布喀斯和开奇间的运河，每秒九千立方公尺运水到鄂毕水库，而以一千立方公尺放入叶尼塞水电站的涡轮。从开奇到鄂毕水库中间水底瀑流亦将加以利用——这里将再建筑一个水电站。
    新的水电站将保证供应库兹巴斯和新西伯利亚工业中心以廉价的能。
    另外一个任务亦将解决。从西伯利亚的深林里将可能运出成百万立方公尺的宝贵木材。廉价的能将创造异常地发展伐木业的全然可能。这些木质业纤维底量将够保证全世界用纸底大部分。
    依加尔喀——马库航线
    沿鄂毕河和叶尼塞河的河道设闸堵水不仅是为取得电能，还为了创造深水以沟通喀位海和里海间的交通运输。海轮将可目杜丁喀，自依加乐喀，自乌斯奇港及鄂毕水库底新港口载运木材、皮毛及其他原料到马库，回来则载运石油、茶叶、米、水果，途中还可采集乌拉尔的金属及中亚细亚轻工业产品。这条航线一趟将长达五千余公里。它的起迄将是这样：依加尔喀——托波尔斯克——阿拉尔斯克——克拉斯诺沃茨克——巴库。（附图片）
