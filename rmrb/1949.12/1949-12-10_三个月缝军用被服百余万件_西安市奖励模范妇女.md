　　Xi'an City Rewards Model Women
　　[Xi'an News] The Xi'an City Women's Production Support Front Labor Model Conference for sewing military socks, clothing, and bedding was held on the 27th of last month in the auditorium of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Women's Middle School. Attendees included 73 labor models and representatives from various units such as the Xi'an Municipal Government, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Women's Federation, the Northwest Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Women's Department of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, the Municipal Student Union, the Young Women's Christian Association, district offices, and various primary and secondary schools, totaling over 70 people. At the meeting, Liu Fang of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Women's Federation reported on the achievements of the labor models and summarized the work of supporting the front. The summary pointed out that during this support-the-front effort, more than 60,000 working women and over 900 female teachers and students participated in sewing military uniforms and socks. Through their efforts, they sewed a total of 500,000 pairs of military socks, 210,000 military quilts, 250,000 sets of cotton military uniforms, 600 military overcoats, pasted over 36,000 pairs of shoe soles, and buttonholed 20,000 sets of military uniforms in three months. This also led to the emergence of a group of active working women who will become powerful assistants in carrying out women's work in the future. After the report, children from the Primary School Affiliated to the Teachers College presented flowers to the 73 labor models amidst music. Subsequently, the person in charge of the Municipal Government and many others spoke, unanimously praising the brilliant achievements demonstrated by working women, especially labor models, in supporting the front, and expressed the hope that they would continue to maintain the glorious title of "Labor Model." Finally, towels, cloth, soap, socks, and other items donated by eight units, including the Municipal People's Government, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Women's Federation, were distributed to all labor models as awards. After the meeting, everyone took a group photo and held a dinner and evening party to entertain all the labor models.
