Beware of the Hypocrites of Imperialism

The American imperialists, with certain political aims, once conducted work in the Liberated Areas through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The North China representative of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, in his work in North China after liberation, has again exposed the fact that he violated the mutual understanding with the China Liberated Areas Relief Association and attempted to harm our country's sovereignty. The solemn statement issued today by Xiong Jinjing, the person in charge of the China Liberated Areas Relief Association, is very necessary.

During the period when the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, controlled by the American imperialists, worked in China, it handed over relief materials worth US$535,617,000 to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, of which only 2 percent was allocated to the Liberated Areas. At that time, it flaunted the so-called principle of non-discrimination in the distribution of materials to disaster victims in all war zones of China. In fact, its purpose was not really to provide relief to the people in the Liberated Areas, but to use its mere 50,000 tons of materials to blur our people's understanding and buy our people's favor, in order to cover up the crime of American imperialism in providing a large amount of material assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in carrying out the anti-people war. However, our people's eyes are sharp, and they see its true sinister purpose very clearly and will never be deceived.

Now, the North China representative of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund has violated the mutual understanding in the exchange of letters with the China Liberated Areas Relief Association, disregarded our reasonable suggestions, and even put forward conditions that would damage our country's sovereignty in a threatening tone, asking us to accept them, attempting to use hundreds of thousands of US dollars worth of materials to bribe our people to bow their heads to American imperialism. The Chinese people have never bowed their heads under the oppression and aggression of imperialism for a hundred years. They have been fighting bravely and making persistent efforts, and now they have finally won the basic victory throughout the country and stood up in the world. American imperialism still vainly attempts to continue to implement its bribery policy, which cannot but increase our people's hatred and vigilance against American imperialism!

The fact that there are elements in the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund who attempt to harm China's sovereignty and do not really carry out relief work for children and pregnant women is also worthy of attention and vigilance by countries and representatives who participate in the fund and are genuinely willing to do such relief work.

As for the North China representative and its organization of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, we can only be happy that they have ended because their attempts have failed. Another group of honey-tongued pickpockets has been sent away, thank goodness!

### 警惕帝国主义的伪善者

　　警惕帝国主义的伪善者
    美帝国主义者曾经抱着一定的政治目的，通过联合国善后救济总署在解放区进行工作。联合国儿童紧急基金会华北代表，在解放后的华北工作，又暴露了它违背和中国解放区救济总会间的相互谅解，企图损害我国主权的事实，中国解放区救济总会负责人熊瑾玎今天发表的严正声明，是非常必要的。
    美帝国主义者控制下的联合国善后救济总署在华工作时期中交给蒋匪集团之救济物资共值美金五三五、六一七、○○○元，其中分配给解放区者仅及百分之二。当时他标榜着对中国全国战区灾民所谓物资分配之不歧视原则，事实上它的目的并不是真的要救济解放区人民，而是企图利用其区区五万吨物资模糊我们人民的认识，贿买我人民的好感，以掩盖美帝国主义者以大量物资援助蒋匪进行反人民战争之罪行。但是我人民的眼睛是雪亮的，对它的真正罪恶目的，看得非常明白，绝不受骗上当。
    现在联合国国际儿童紧急基金会华北代表既违背了和中国解放区救济总会换函中的互相谅解，置我合理建议于不顾，又复以威胁口吻，提出有损我国主权的条件，要我们接受，企图以几十万美元的物资，贿买我人民向美帝国主义低头。我中国人民，在帝国主义百年来的压迫侵略下，就从来没有低过头，一直英勇奋斗，再接再厉，现在终于获得全国基本的胜利，在世界上站立起来了。美帝国主义还妄想继续执行其贿买政策，这不能不使我国人民对美帝国主义增加痛恨和警惕！
    联合国国际儿童紧急基金会里，有这类企图损害中国主权而并不真正进行救济儿童孕妇等工作的分子，这一件事实，也很值得参加该会而真正愿意做这种救济工作的国家和代表们的注意和警惕。
    至于联合国国际儿童紧急基金会华北代表及其机构，因为企图不逞而结束，对于我们来说是只有感到高兴。又送走了一批口蜜腹剑的扒手，谢天谢地！
