To Improve Learning Efficiency, Peking University Streamlines Courses
Arts Faculty Departments Select Key Courses
Teachers and Students Concentrate on Enriching and Reforming Content

[By Our Correspondent] Peking University's Arts, Law, Science, Engineering, and Medicine faculties have implemented streamlined courses in some departments to improve the teaching and learning efficiency of teachers and students and to promote curriculum reform. Since the beginning of this semester at Peking University, students' universally high learning enthusiasm and some students' ambition have led to a general increase in the number of credits selected compared to previous years. As a result, teachers and students are busy attending and leaving classes all day, rushing to read reference books, rushing to do exercises, and rushing to write reports, putting them in a completely passive state, unable to obtain a thorough understanding and unable to actively and systematically develop their studies. At the same time, it has seriously affected students' health, because students in the Arts, Science, Engineering, and Law faculties spend more than seventy hours per week studying, while medical students spend more than eighty hours. Under these circumstances, the political study of the various departments cannot be properly carried out.

In view of this situation, appropriately streamlining courses has become necessary. First, the University Committee widely collected opinions from students and professors, stipulated flexible measures for the credit system, and set the total number of credits for students to select and the total weekly study time. In principle, students should select courses totaling twenty credits, and the total weekly student time should not exceed sixty hours. If this is exceeded, the departments can streamline courses according to the specific circumstances.

At the beginning of implementation, some teachers and students had different views on streamlining courses. For example, some professors in the Engineering College believed that streamlining courses would make students lazy and not study hard; some students believed that streamlining courses would only allow professors to teach some basic courses, which would be neither "profound" nor "difficult to understand," and would lose academic "dignity." After studying the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's cultural and educational policies, everyone realized that streamlining courses would not lower the level of courses, but would instead seek a deep and thorough understanding of the courses. Thus, the streamlining of courses was implemented. The Science, Medicine, and Arts faculties, as well as the Mechanical Engineering Department of the Engineering College, have streamlined courses according to the principles of the University Committee. Students have dropped unnecessary courses, maintaining seventeen to twenty credits, and professors have streamlined lecture content, adjusted course hours, stopped offering some unnecessary courses, or changed some required courses to electives.

When streamlining courses, the departments generally cooperate with teachers and students to achieve ideological unity, jointly propose streamlining plans, and gradually improve them during implementation. In this way, students have sufficient time to study their courses in depth, and professors can fully prepare and improve teaching methods; at the same time, it promotes curriculum reform. The departments and classes of the Arts Faculty have stipulated one or two key courses, and teachers and students concentrate their efforts to jointly discuss and collect materials to transform and enrich their content. For example, the key courses in the Chinese Department are Literary Theory and History of Chinese Literature. Professor You Guoen has begun to explain using the viewpoints and methods of historical materialism, and students are divided into several discussion groups for research. The key courses in the Western Language Department are Russian and English prose. The content of English prose used to be mainly British classical literature, but now it is mainly progressive literary creations, and teachers and students jointly collect materials. The key course in the Philosophy Department is Materialist Dialectics, taught by Ai Siqi. After learning together, the professors and students in the department use it to criticize the idealism and dualism they learned in the past. After streamlining the courses, the teaching confidence of teachers and students has been improved. Professor Huang Min of the Vietnamese Group of the Department of Oriental Languages ​​said to the students: "In the past, I have never seen students with such high learning enthusiasm. We must work together." Many professors in the Department of Oriental Languages ​​guarantee to teach students the language they are learning well in two years.

　　提高学习效率北大精简课程
  　文学院各系级选定重点课程
    师生集中精力充实改造内容
    【本报讯】北京大学文法理工医各学院部分系级实行精简课程，以提高师生教与学的效率，并推动了课程改革。北大本期开学以来，由于学生普遍高涨的学习热情与部分学生的好高鹜远，以致选修学分数目较之往年普遍增加，结果师生整天忙于上课下课、赶看参考书、赶习题、赶报告，完全处于被动状态，无法求得透澈的了解，不能主动地有计划地展开学习。同时，又严重地影响了学生的健康，因为文理工学院学生每人每周学习时间超过七十小时，医学院则超过了八十小时。在此情况下，各系级的政治学习亦无法好好展开。
    针对此种情况，适当地精简课程已成为必要。首先，校委会广泛搜集学生与教授的意见，规定出学分制度的变通办法和学生选修学分总数和每周学习总时间，即学生选课以二十个学分为原则，每周学生总时间不超过六十小时，如有超过，各系级，各系级可根据具体情况精简课程。
    在开始实行时，一部分师生对精简课程有不同地见解。如工学院有的教授认为：精简了课程学生就会偷懒，不好好学习；有的学生认为精简了课程，教授只能讲些基本课程，既不“高深”也不“难懂”，有失学术“尊严”。在学习了人民政协共同纲领文化教育政策之后，大家认识到精简课程不会降低功课水平，而是为了求得对课程深入透澈的理解。于是精简课程乃得交付实行。理、医、文学院及工学院机械系等都已根据校委会原则精简了课程，学生即退选了不必要的课程，保持十七个至二十个学分，教授即精简讲课内容，或调整课程钟点，或停开一部分不必要的课，或将一些必修课程改为选修。
    各系级精简课程时，一般是师生合作，取得思想上的一致，共同提出精简计划，并在实行中逐步改进。这样学生比较有充分的时间去钻研功课，教授也可以充分预备，改进教学方法；同时也推动了课程的改革。文学院各系各班规定了一门或两门的重点课程，师生集中力量共同讨论、共同收集资料来改造、充实其内容。如中文系重点课为文艺学与中国文学史，游国恩教授已开始应用唯物史观的观点和方法进行讲解，同学分为若干讨论小组进行研究；西语系重点课为俄文及英文散文，英文散文内容以前多为英国古典文学，现在则以进步的文学创作为主，由师生共同收集资料；哲学系以唯物辩证法为重点课程，由艾思奇讲授，系内教授与学生共同学习后即以此来批判旧时所学的唯心论与二元论。精简课程后，师生的教学信心都提高了。东语系越南组教授黄敏对学生说：“在过去，从未见过学生学习情绪这样高，我们要一齐努力。”东语系许多教授都保证两年教好学生所学的语文。
