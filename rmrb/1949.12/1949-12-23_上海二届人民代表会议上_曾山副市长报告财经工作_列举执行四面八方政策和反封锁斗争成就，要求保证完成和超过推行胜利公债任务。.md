Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 22nd: At the Second Shanghai People's Representative Conference, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai Zeng Shan delivered a detailed report on Shanghai's financial and economic work since liberation. With various figures and concrete facts, Deputy Mayor Zeng earnestly and responsibly reported to the representatives the achievements Shanghai's financial and economic work had made in implementing the correct "Four Directions, Eight Sides" policy and in the anti-blockade struggle over the past five months. He also pointed out the difficulties that still exist and put forward suggestions for overcoming them. His report was warmly supported by representatives from all walks of life.

		Finance
    Cracking Down on Speculation in Silver Dollars and Gold Notes, Launching Real Value Savings and Remittances to Prosper the Economy and Stabilize People's Livelihoods

In the financial section of his report, Deputy Mayor Zeng pointed out that since liberation, due to the elimination of the puppet "Gold Yuan Coupon," the prohibition of free trading and circulation of silver dollars, gold notes, and foreign currencies, and the crackdown on speculation in silver dollars and gold notes, the Renminbi has established credibility among the masses and gradually expanded its circulation, becoming an important condition for developing production, prospering the economy, and stabilizing people's livelihoods. By launching real value savings, domestic remittances, and collateralized remittances, correctly managing private banks and money shops, and gradually controlling interest rates, the financial industry has gradually moved onto the right path of supporting production. In these two tasks, the People's Government did not hesitate to use huge amounts of funds to redeem the puppet "Gold Yuan Coupon" in order to protect the people's interests. In the three months after the launch of real value savings, the government made huge subsidy expenditures to ensure the livelihoods of workers and their families; at the same time, it also reduced disputes between labor and management caused by wage adjustments.

		Trade
    Actively Connecting Urban and Rural Areas, Vigorously Supplying Grain, Coal, and Raw Materials, Overcoming Speculation, and Stabilizing Prices

In terms of trade, due to actively restoring and connecting urban and rural relations, uniting import and export merchants to conduct anti-blockade measures, and vigorously regulating supply and demand, the supply of coal, rice, and cotton in Shanghai has been resolved successively. At present, coal and rice reserves are abundant, and efforts are being made to store them in preparation for the lean season next year. If the joint purchase of cotton is further strengthened, it can also guarantee the operating needs of factories for three days and three nights to five days and five nights per week. Other industrial raw materials have also been gradually largely resolved. Therefore, Shanghai had achieved price stability for two to three months after August. During the national price increases in mid-October, Shanghai's state-owned trade continued to make every effort to supply goods, often selling millions of catties of grain, tens of thousands of bolts of cloth, and thousands of pieces of yarn every day, recovering more than 1 billion in currency daily. However, Deputy Mayor Zeng pointed out that a large amount of idle capital in Shanghai has not yet been transferred to production, which is fueling market fluctuations. Furthermore, a small number of speculators have not stopped their behavior of undermining the interests of the majority. He hoped that the conference representatives would pay close attention to this and give the government more support to overcome it.

		Industry and Commerce
    Devastated and Broken Before Liberation, Now Gradually Moving Towards Stability and Activity with Government Support and Assistance After Liberation

In the industry and commerce section of his report, Deputy Mayor Zeng first asked everyone to recall the situation when the People's Liberation Army entered Shanghai and listed specific materials to illustrate the miserable state of Shanghai's industry and commerce, which was devastated and riddled with holes. Deputy Mayor Zeng pointed out that after liberation, the People's Government immediately did its best to assist in the recovery, implementing a series of measures such as allowing self-provided foreign exchange to purchase imported cotton, exempting cotton import taxes, announcing special export methods for yarn and cloth, foreign trade methods, promoting export trade methods, establishing a foreign exchange exchange, helping manufacturers collect unsalable materials, and exchanging cotton for forward yarn from yarn factories, etc., making every effort to promote exports and encourage the import of raw materials for the textile industry to assist private factories in resuming production. Although Shanghai was a severely colonialized city in the past, and coupled with the blockade and sabotage by imperialism and the Kuomintang after liberation, industry and commerce were still in extreme difficulty in the first one or two months. However, due to the rapid development of the Liberation War, labor-management relations were largely resolved under the principle of mutual benefit for both labor and management, especially with the strong support of the government (such as large-scale orders and purchases of finished products, supply of raw materials such as raw cotton, yarn, and soybeans, and expansion of industrial loans), the improvement of transportation, the expansion of Sino-Soviet barter trade, and the gradual increase in internal and external exchanges, the reverse scissors difference between industrial products and grain has greatly changed, finally enabling Shanghai's industry and commerce to gradually enter a period of stable and active transition.

Deputy Mayor Zeng used various figures and statistics to explain in detail the transitional period of Shanghai's industry and commerce. He said that the light and heavy industrial units taken over by the government not only immediately resumed more than 90% of production after liberation, but also increased their output month by month. The output of yarn and cloth in September increased by about 50% compared with May. The increase in the output of heavy industrial units was particularly significant. In the private sector, this situation is also fully reflected in the statistics of the goods tax levied by the Goods Tax Bureau and the electricity consumption statistics of the Public Utilities Bureau. In terms of production and sales, the production and sales of wheat flour alone increased by more than double in October compared with September. Electricity consumption increased by about 13% in September compared with June, of which industrial electricity consumption increased by 22%. According to the industrial operating rate statistics surveyed by the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, August increased by 27% compared with July, September was more than double that of July, and October was still increasing. Especially in the heavy industry sector, because of the strong support of the government, machinery, electrical machinery, steel smelting, especially shipbuilding, the entire industry is operating and still cannot finish the orders on hand.

		Factory Recovery Achievements

Deputy Mayor Zeng then listed the situation of various industries, explaining the achievements of factory recovery. In the cotton textile industry, which accounts for the largest proportion of Shanghai's industry, the actual number of spindles in operation in private yarn factories increased from 72.9% in July to 80.69% in September. In the week of October 16th to 22nd, the output of yarn and cloth increased by about 30% compared with the previous week. For example, the reproduction industries such as machine dyeing and weaving, underwear, towels, handkerchiefs, and canvas also saw a general increase in the operating rate of various factories due to the expansion of sales in North China and along the Yangtze River. Among them, the largest-scale Xinguang Underwear Factory has been operating day and night since October. In other industries, taking the enamel industry, which relies heavily on foreign raw materials, as an example, more than three-quarters had resumed production by the beginning of November. Deputy Mayor Zeng pointed out that with the progress of industry and the activity of the market, the financial and commercial industries engaged in legitimate business generally improved. In the financial industry, small and medium-sized banks and shops have made profits, and the income and expenditure of large banks and shops are also close to balanced. Taking the four major companies as an example, the turnover of retail stores increased by an average of double in September compared with July and August. On the other hand, many gold and silver shops have changed their business, luxury commerce is gradually declining, and consumer commerce is operating normally, which is also a good phenomenon in economic transformation.

Deputy Mayor Zeng also pointed out that Shanghai's industry and commerce still face practical difficulties such as a shortage and price increase of raw materials, the impact of idle capital speculation, and the fact that urban-rural relations have not been done better. He hoped that the business community would work together under the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to develop production and prosper the economy and overcome the current difficulties.

		Rail and Shipping Rapidly Recovered, Tax Revenue Increased, and There Was a Surplus

In the fourth and fifth parts of the report, Deputy Mayor Zeng also reported with detailed figures how the railways and shipping fought hard and rapidly recovered and developed under the enemy's sabotage and bombing; how the railway finances went from losses to gradual surpluses and were able to use the surpluses for self-reliant recovery and construction; and the gradual improvement of tax rules and rates, and the monthly increase in tax revenue. The statistics on municipal treasury expenditures further proved the People's Government's policy of taking from the people and using it for the people. Taking October as an example, the expenditures of the Higher Education Department and the Education Bureau ranked first, accounting for more than 27% of the total expenditures, and the Health Bureau ranked third. What is particularly exciting is that Deputy Mayor Zeng pointed out in his report that the municipal treasury has had a slight surplus in the past five months. This is a very good foundation for future municipal construction.

		Five Tasks for the Future

Finally, Deputy Mayor Zeng put forward five tasks for the future: (1) In the financial field: resolutely implement the financial policy in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. At present, Shanghai should focus on guiding idle capital into legitimate industry and commerce, especially into factory production and transportation, in order to reduce its capital turnover difficulties and accelerate the recovery and development of production. However, in order to achieve this goal, severe sanctions must be imposed on financial speculators and those who undermine the national financial industry, so as to ensure the stability of Shanghai's financial market. (2) In the field of trade: continue to develop urban-rural mutual assistance, store grain and coal, break through the enemy's blockade, and strengthen internal and external exchanges. Encourage the import of essential raw materials to support the development of production, regulate supply and demand, and stabilize prices. Guide private trade to implement the trade policy of the People's Government and operate legitimate business under the principle of considering both public and private interests. Speculative activities that disrupt the market must be strictly banned. (3) In the field of industry and commerce: continue to work hard to restore Shanghai's industry and commerce, provide convenience to those who have difficulties in restoring production; and gradually guide the industry and commerce that completely relied on imperialism in the past to transform into self-reliant production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. (4) In terms of transportation: 1. Improve transportation efficiency and reduce transportation costs. 2. Increase transportation tools. 3. Improve employees' political awareness and work enthusiasm. 4. Actively defend against air raids. 5. Organize financial income and adjust freight rates to achieve a balance between income and expenditure. Enrich the transportation industry and facilitate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. (5) In terms of financial tasks: 1. We should correctly recognize the difficulties in the national finances in the final victory next year. The Central People's Government has decided to issue the People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds, which is a powerful measure to overcome national financial difficulties and strive for price stability, and is beneficial to the working people and military and government personnel and teachers and farmers across the country, and is also beneficial to the normal operation of industry and commerce. Therefore, we must call on the six million people in Shanghai to actively support it, especially industrialists, businessmen, and wealthy households should actively subscribe and guarantee to complete and exceed the task of promoting the People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds assigned to Shanghai by the Central People's Government. 2. Continue to organize tax revenue and study a rational local tax system that is conducive to production. Establish a budget and final account system, save administrative expenses, and enrich the funding for municipal construction.

　　上海二届人民代表会议上
    曾山副市长报告财经工作
    列举执行四面八方政策和反封锁斗争成就，要求保证完成和超过推行胜利公债任务。
    【新华社上海二十二日电】上海市副市长曾山六日在上海市第二届各界人民代表会议上对解放以来上海市的财政经济工作作了详细的报告。曾副市长以各种数字和具体事实，诚恳负责地向代表们报告了五个月来上海财政经济工作在执行正确的四面八方政策和反封锁斗争中反获得的成就，并指出目前尚存在的困难，提出了克服困难的意见。他的报告得到各界代表热烈的拥护。
    　　　　金融
    打击银元金钞投机举办折实储蓄汇兑繁荣经济安定民生
    曾副市长在金融部分的报告中指出：解放以后，由于进行了肃清伪金圆券，禁止银元、金钞、外币的自由买卖和流通，打击了银元、金钞的投机活动，人民币在群众中建立了威信，逐步扩大了流通范围，成为发展生产、繁荣经济、安定民生的重要条件。由于举办了折实储蓄、内汇和押汇，正确地管理了私人银钱业和逐步掌握利率的结果，使金融事业逐步走向扶助生产的正道。在这两项工作中，人民政府为了保障人民利益，曾不惜以巨额资金收兑伪金圆券。折实储蓄举办后三个月中，政府进行了巨额的补贴支出，保障了职工及其家属的生活；同时也因此减少了劳资间因调整工资所引起的纠纷。
    　　　　贸易
    积极沟通城乡关系大力供应粮煤原料克服投机稳定物价
    贸易方面，由于积极恢复和沟通城乡关系，团结进出口商进行反封锁和大力调剂供求的结果，上海煤、米、棉的供应都已次第解决。目前，煤及米存量充裕，并正尽力存储，以备明年青黄不接时之所需；棉花如继续加强联购工作，也可保证各厂每周三天三夜到五天五夜的开工需量。其他工业原料等，也都已逐渐大部解决。因此，上海八月以后曾获得二、三个月时间的物价稳定。十月中旬全国物价上涨中，上海国营贸易仍尽力供应，经常能每天卖出粮食数百万斤、布万匹、纱千件，每日收回通货达十亿之多。但曾副市长指出：上海还有大部分游资未转入生产，对市场的波动起着推波助澜的作用；更有少数投机者还未停止其破坏多数人利益的行为，希望大会代表深刻注意，并给政府更多支持，予以克服。
    　　　　工商业
    解放前支离破碎百孔千疮解放后政府扶植协助恢复现在已逐步走向平稳活跃
    在工商业部分的报告中，曾副市长首先请大家回忆当解放军进入上海时所面对着的情况，并列举具体材料说明当时上海工商业支离破碎、百孔千疮的惨状。曾副市长指出，解放后人民政府一开始就尽可能协助恢复，一连串实行了准许自备外汇购买棉花进口，免除棉花进口税，公布纱布特许出口办法、对外贸易办法、推广输出贸易办法，成立外汇交易所，帮助各厂商收进滞销物资，以棉花调换纱厂期纱等，尽力推动外销和鼓励纺织业原料进口，协助私厂恢复生产。虽然由于上海过去是严重的殖民地化的城市，解放后加上帝国主义和国民党的封锁破坏，在开始一、二个月，工商业仍处极端困难中，但是由于解放战争飞跃地向前发展，在劳资两利的原则下，劳资关系大部得到解决，尤其是得到政府大力扶植（如大量订购、收购成品，供应原棉、纱、大豆等原料，扩大工业贷款），交通运输情况的改善，中苏易货的展开，内外交流逐渐繁密，工业品与粮食的反剪力差大为改变，终于使上海的工商业逐步走进平稳活跃的转捩时期。
    曾副市长以各种数字和统计详尽地说明了上海工商业的转捩时期。他说：政府接管的轻重工业各单位，不但解放后立即复工十分之九以上，而且生产量按月递增。九月份纱与布的产量较五月份增加约百分之五十左右。重工业各单位产量增高尤其显著。私营企业方面，从货物税局课征货物税统计和公用局用电统计中亦可充分反映出这一情况。生产品产销情况，单麦粉产销十月份较九月份增加一倍多。用电量九月份较六月份增加约百分之十三，其中工业用电量增加了百分之二十二。根据工商联合会筹备会所调查的工业开工率统计：八月份比七月份增加百分之二十七，九月份较七月份高出一倍以上，十月份更在增加中。特别在重工业方面，因为政府大力扶植，机器、电机、钢铁制炼，特别是造船业，全体开工还来不及做完定货额。
    　　　　工厂恢复成绩
    曾副市长接着列举各业情况，说明工厂恢复的成绩。占上海工业最大比重的棉纺工业，私营纱厂实际周转的纱锭数字，已从七月份的百分之七二．九增至九月份的八○．六九。在十月十六日至二十二日一周内，纱布产量较前周约增百分之三十。又如机器染织、内衣、毛巾、手帕、帆布等复制工业，由于华北及长江沿线销路展开，各厂开工率亦普遍增加。其中规模最大的新光内衣厂，十月份起已日夜开工。其他工业中，即以原料大部仰给国外的搪瓷业为例，十一月初也已有四分之三以上复工。曾副市长指出，随着工业的进展和市面的活跃，从事正当营业的金融业与商业，一般都好转。金融业中，中小行庄已有盈余，大行庄收支亦接近平衡。零售店以四大公司为例，九月份起营业额较七、八两月平均增加了一倍。另一方面，许多金银字号已改行，奢侈性商业渐趋衰退，消费性的则营业平平，也是在经济改造中的好现象。
    曾副市长也指出：上海工商业还存在着原料短缺和涨价、游资投机影响、城乡关系还未做得更好等实际困难。他希望工商界在人民政协共同纲领下，为发展生产与繁荣经济而共同奋斗，克服当前困难。
    　　　　铁道航运迅速恢复税收增加已有结余
    在报告的第四、五两部分中，曾副市长同样引据详尽的数字报告了铁道航运怎样在敌人破坏、轰炸下艰苦奋斗、迅速恢复发展的情况；铁道财政的从亏损到渐有盈余，且能以盈余进行自力的恢复和建设的情况；以及税则税率的逐步改善，税收的逐月增加。市库支出方面的统计更证明了人民政府取之于民用之于民的方针。以十月份为例，高教处和教育局的支出占第一位，为总支出的百分之二十七强，卫生局为第三位。特别令人兴奋的是曾副市长在报告中指出了五个月来市库已略有结余。这是今后市政建设的很好基础。
    　　　　今后五项任务
    曾副市长在最后提出了今后五项工作任务：（一）金融方面：坚决执行人民政协共同纲领中金融政策，当前上海应努力着重引导游资投入正当工商业，特别是转入工厂生产与运输交通事业，以减少其资金周转的困难，加速恢复和发展生产。但为要达到此目的，必须对金融投机及破坏国家金融事业者予以严厉制裁，以便保证稳定上海市场金融。（二）贸易方面：继续发展城乡互助，存储粮煤，冲破敌人封锁，加强内外交流。鼓励必需原料进口，以扶助发展生产，调剂供求，稳定物价。引导私营贸易，执行人民政府的贸易政策，在公私兼顾的原则下，经营正当业务。对于扰乱市场的投机行为，必须严格取缔。（三）工商方面：应继续努力恢复上海工商业，对恢复生产有困难者，予以便利；对过去完全依赖帝国主义之工商业，逐渐引导转变为对国计民生有利的自立更生之生产事业。（四）交通运输方面：一、提高运输效率，减低运输成本。二、增加运输工具。三、提高员工政治认识与工作积极性。四、积极防空。五、整理财政收入，调整运费，以求收支平衡。充实运输事业，便利城乡物资交流。（五）财政任务方面：一、应正确认识到明年全国财政上在最后胜利中的困难，中央人民政府已经决定发行人民胜利折实公债，这是克服全国财政困难，争取物价稳定的有力措施，对全国工资生活的劳动人民和军政公教人员及农民有好处，而对工商业的正常经营也是有益的。所以我们要来号召上海六百万人民积极拥护，特别是工商业者和殷实富户应踊跃认购，并保证完成和超过中央人民政府分配给上海推行的人民胜利折实公债的任务。二、继续整理税收，研究有利于生产的合理的地方税制。建立预决算制度，节省行政开支，充实市政建设之经费。
