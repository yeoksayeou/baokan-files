Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued the following notice regarding the fact that railway unions at all levels are not required to pay membership dues to local trade unions in various provinces and cities:

Based on the opinion of the Preparatory Committee of the National Railway Union, due to the large number of provinces, cities, counties, and villages that the railway lines pass through, which differs from the situation of general industrial unions, it is impossible to pay membership dues to local trade unions. Therefore, it is decided that:

(1) Railway unions at all levels throughout the country shall not pay membership dues to local trade unions (including provinces, cities, counties, and villages).

(2) The Northeast Railway Union shall pay 10% of its monthly membership dues to the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions. Railway unions within the customs area will uniformly pay 10% of the monthly membership dues payable to local trade unions to the National Railway Union for transfer to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and will no longer pay to the local trade unions.

It is hoped that the National Railway Union, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, and the general trade unions of various regions, provinces, and cities within the customs area will act in accordance with the above two measures.

　　中华全国总工会通知
  　全国铁路工会各级组织不向地方工会缴纳会费
    【新华社北京三十日电】中华全总工会发出关于各级铁路工会不向各省市地方工会缴纳会费的通知如下：
    根据全国铁路总工会筹备委员会的意见，由于铁路沿线所经过之省、市、县及村镇太多，与一般产业工会之情况不同，无法向地方总工会缴纳会费，特决定：
    （一）铁路工会在全国之各级组织一律不向所在地方工会（包括各省、市、县及村镇）缴纳会费。
    （二）东北铁路工会，应将每月所交会费的百分之十缴给东北总工会；关内各铁路工会将每月应缴纳地方工会百分之十的会费统一缴给全国铁路总工会转交中华全国总工会，不再缴给各地方工会。
    以上两项办法望全国铁路总工会、东北总工会与关内各地区、省、市总工会照办。
    　　　　　　中华全国总工会
    　一九四九年十二月十五日
