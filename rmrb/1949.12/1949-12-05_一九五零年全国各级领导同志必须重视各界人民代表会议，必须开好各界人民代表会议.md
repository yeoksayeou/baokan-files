　　The Central People's Government Committee passed the "General Rules for the Organization of People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in Cities," the "General Rules for the Organization of People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in Counties," and the "General Rules for the Organization of People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in Provinces" at its fourth meeting on the 2nd of this month. This is an important step in promoting close ties between people's governments at all levels and the broad masses of the people. At present, approximately 80 percent of the country's territory, with a population of approximately 400 million, has been liberated, and the overall situation has been basically determined. Moreover, most cities, counties, and provinces have already met the conditions for convening people's representative conferences of all circles. At this time, it is entirely necessary and timely for the Central People's Government to promulgate unified decrees on the organization of representative conferences of all circles at all levels, stipulating several important principles to be followed by all parts of the country.

　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China advocated convening people's representative conferences of all circles as early as November 1948; and since the summer of 1949, it has vigorously promoted and urged this.

　　Facts have proven that people's representative conferences of all circles are an excellent organizational form for people's governments to connect with the broad masses of the people, and also an effective method for mobilizing the broad masses of the people to assist the government in completing various revolutionary and construction tasks. In places where people's representative conferences of all circles have been convened, the policies, laws, and administrative intentions of the people's governments have been understood and grasped by the representatives and the broad masses through the reports of responsible comrades of the people's governments and the discussions, decisions, and dissemination by the representatives. This has greatly promoted their political awareness, improved their policy and ideological level, and inspired their sense of responsibility and initiative. The broad masses have spontaneously risen to assist the government in implementing various government orders; and the people's governments have been able to understand the lives and demands of the people of all strata more fully, and commit fewer bureaucratic errors. At the same time, because representatives of all strata gather together to fully express their views and opinions, exchange ideas and consult with each other, their difficulties and demands are understood by the other parties, breaking down the usual barriers and moving towards further unity. Unanimous decisions are reached on many issues, making it much easier for the people's governments to carry out various work tasks, and avoiding many deviations, and correcting errors in a timely manner. Therefore, people's representative conferences of all circles are also a school for cadres and the people to learn from each other. Therefore, in many places, after successfully holding people's representative conferences of all circles, the relationship between the government and the people has become increasingly close, further consolidating the people's democratic regime. Thus, various complex revolutionary tasks, such as grain requisition, tax collection, financial expenditure, suppression of bandits, anti-local tyrant struggles, rent reduction and interest rate reduction, resolution of labor-capital relations, public-private relations, implementation of land reform, restoration and development of economic and cultural and educational undertakings, etc., have been carried out more easily and smoothly because of the assistance of the broad masses. Conversely, in places where people's representative conferences of all circles have not been convened, or where the conferences have not been held well, that is, not earnestly, not realistically, not freely, and not democratically, various tasks still have to rely on a small number of cadres to do, and the results are relatively poor, and even serious bureaucracy occurs, and major errors are not corrected quickly.

　　Through almost a full year of experience in 1949, the vast number of leading cadres throughout the country have recognized the great significance and role of convening people's representative conferences of all circles. However, there are still many comrades who do not fully understand the significance and role of people's representative conferences of all circles, and therefore adopt an intolerable passive attitude towards this major task. These comrades delay the convening of people's representative conferences of all circles, using excuses such as "the local work lacks a foundation," "the masses have no organization," and "holding meetings delays time." Or, although they are convened, they are not held earnestly, not realistically, lack preparation beforehand, the spirit of democracy is not fully promoted at the meeting, the representatives cannot speak freely, and cannot focus on discussing and solving one or two central issues each time, so that the meeting does not yield much. The reason for this phenomenon is the prevalence of the closed-doorism that separates them from the masses. These comrades only trust a small number of cadres, do not trust the broad masses and the representative figures of the masses, and think that a few people can do everything, are unwilling to listen to the opinions of the masses, and are unwilling to carry out various tasks together with the broad masses and their representatives. The thinking of these comrades is completely wrong. Leading comrades at all levels should know that convening people's representative conferences of all circles is the best way to systematically mobilize the masses, assist the people's government, establish revolutionary order, suppress counter-revolutionary activities, and promote various complex and arduous tasks. The scope and effect of mobilizing the broad masses through the people's representative conferences and the representatives attending the meetings are greater than any other method. If we do not adopt this method of convening people's representative conferences of all circles to systematically contact the masses and mobilize the masses, but rely on a small number of cadres to carry out individual activities, or use mandatory orders to promote work, then the work will definitely encounter difficulties, take detours, and even make mistakes. The fundamental question is: Is it better to rely on a small number of people to work, or to let the broad masses jointly take responsibility? All experience has proven that people's representative conferences of all circles should be convened quickly in all places, whether in old or newly liberated cities and counties, and the conditions for holding meetings must not be set too high, because many conditions can be gradually created later, and the meetings can also be improved one at a time.

　　The three general rules for the organization of people's representative conferences of all circles are produced in accordance with the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference and are important decrees of the Central People's Government. We hope that people's governments in various regions will conscientiously, rapidly, and universally abide by and implement them. According to the three organizational rules, from January 1950, all liberated cities and counties across the country must strive to hold meetings once every three months. In 1950, every city with a population of more than 30,000 and every county must strive to hold meetings four times, striving not to be lacking. Each meeting should be publicly published in the local newspaper and should be reported to the people's government at the next higher level up to the Central People's Government, so that the Central People's Government knows the situation of the meetings held in all cities and counties across the country, in order to summarize experience and guide the country. As for the provincial people's representative conferences, we believe that all provinces liberated before the spring of 1950, whether old or new, must strive to convene once in 1950, striving not to be lacking, and must also report to the higher level and the central government. In short, we hope that leading comrades at all levels will attach importance to people's representative conferences of all circles, must boldly and freely convene them, and must hold them well.

### 一九五零年全国各级领导同志必须重视各界人民代表会议，必须开好各界人民代表会议

　　一九五零年全国各级领导同志必须重视各界人民代表会议，     
    必须开好各界人民代表会议
    中央人民政府委员会于本月二日第四次会议上通过了“市各界人民代表会议组织通则”、“县各界人民代表会议组织通则”和“省各界人民代表会议组织通则”。这是推动各级人民政府与广大人民密切联系的重要步骤。现在全国已有百分之八十左右国土大约四万万人口获得了解放，大局业已底定，而且大多数市、县、省都已具备了召开各界人民代表会议的条件；这时，中央人民政府对于各级各界代表会议的组织，颁布统一的法令，规定若干项重要原则，以资全国各地遵循，是十分必要的和适时的。
    中国共产党中央委员会，早在一九四八年十一月，便倡议召开各界人民代表会；而在一九四九年夏季以来，更极力提倡督促。
    事实证明，各界人民代表会议是人民政府联系广大人民群众的极好的组织形式，也是动员广大人民群众协助政府完成各项革命工作和建设工作的有效办法。凡是召开了各界人民代表会议的地方，经过人民政府负责同志的报告和代表们的讨论决定和传达，人民政府的政策法令和施政意图为代表们及广大群众所了解和掌握，这就大大地促进了他们的政治觉悟，提高了他们的政策思想水平，启发了他们的责任心和积极性，广大群众便自动地起来协助政府推行各项政令；而人民政府也就能比较更多地了解各阶层人民的生活和要求，少犯官僚主义的错误。同时，由于各阶层代表相聚一堂，充分地发表自己的主张和见解，相互切磋协商，使彼此的困难和要求得到对方的谅解，打破平素的隔阂，走向进一步的团结，在许多问题上谋得一致的决定，人民政府推行各项工作任务也就便利得多，并且可以避免发生许多偏差，并及时纠正错误，故各界人民代表会议又是一个干部和人民互相学习的学校。因此，许多地方在开好各界人民代表会议以后，政府和人民的关系便日趋密切，使人民民主政权获得进一步巩固。于是各项复杂的革命工作，例如征粮、收税、财政开支、剿匪、反恶霸、减租减息、解决劳资关系、公私关系、实行土地改革恢复和发展经济事业和文化教育事业等等，因为有了广大群众的协助，一切都比较容易、比较顺利地进行了。反之，凡是没有召开各界人民代表会议或会议开得不好即开得不认真、不切实、不放手、不民主的地方，各项工作仍不能不依靠少数干部来做，结果就比较做得差些，甚至产生严重的官僚主义，犯大错误而得不到迅速纠正。
    通过一九四九年差不多一个整年的经验，全国各地广大的领导干部已经认识了召开各界人民代表会议的重大意义和作用。但是，仍有许多同志对于各界人民代表会议的意义和作用仍然认识不足，因而对于此项重大任务采取了不可容忍的消极态度。这些同志们以所谓“当地工作缺乏基础”，“群众没的组织”，“开会耽误时间”等等为借口，拖延各界人民代表会议的召开。或者，虽然召开了，但开得不认真，不切实，事前缺乏准备，会场没有充分发扬民主精神，代表们不能畅所欲言，不能每次集中讨论和解决一二个中心问题，以致会议的收获不大。其所以产生这种现象，是由于脱离群众的关门主义思想在作怪。这些同志只信任少数干部，不信任广大群众及群众的代表人物，以为少数人就可包办一切，不愿听取群众的意见，不愿把各项工作协同广大群众及其代表们一起来做。这些同志的想法是完全错误的。各级领导同志应当知道：召开各界人民代表会议，正是有系统地发动群众，协助人民政府，建立革命秩序，镇压反革命活动，推进各种复杂繁重的工作的最好方法。经过人民代表会议和出席会议的代表们，去动员广大群众，其范围和效果较任何其他方式为大。如果不采取这种召开各界人民代表会议进行有系统地联系群众和动员群众的方式，却依靠少数干部个别活动的方式，或强迫命令的方式去推行工作，那是一定会使工作遭遇困难，走弯路，甚至犯错误的。根本的问题在于：究竟是依靠少数人工作好，还是让广大群众共同来负责好？一切经验已经证明：各界人民代表会议在一切地方，不论是老的和新解放的城市和县份，均应迅速召开，而决不可把开会的条件提得太高，因为许多条件可以在以后逐渐创造，会议也可以一次比一次地改进的。
    三个各界人民代表会议的组织通则，是根据人民政协的共同纲领产生的，是中央人民政府的重要法令，我们希望各地人民政府认真地迅速地普遍地遵照执行。按照三个组织通则，从一九五○年一月起，全国一切解放了的市和县，均须争取每三个月开会一次，一九五○年每一个三万人口以上的市和每一个县，共须争取开会四次，力求不缺少。每次会议均应在当地报纸上公开发表，并应报告上级人民政府直至中央人民政府，使中央人民政府知道全国一切市县开会的情况，以便总结经验，指导全国。至于省人民代表会议，我们认为，凡在一九五○年春季以前解放的省，不论老的和新的，一九五○年一律要争取召开一次，力求不缺少，同样要报告上级和中央。总之，希望各级领导同志重视各界人民代表会议，一定要大胆放手召开，并要开得好。
