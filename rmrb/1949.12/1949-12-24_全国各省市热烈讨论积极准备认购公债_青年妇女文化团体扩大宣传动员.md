[Reported by this newspaper] Shanghai, Nanjing, Xi'an, Taiyuan and other cities, as well as people from all walks of life in Hebei and Henan provinces, warmly support the Central People's Government's decision to issue Victory Real Value Public Bonds, and are actively preparing to purchase them. The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, in order to mobilize the city's industrial and commercial circles to actively purchase public bonds, has decided to hold a symposium on "Supporting the People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds" and sent a telegram to the Central People's Government, stating that it will mobilize the strength of the entire Shanghai industrial and commercial community to resolutely respond to the call of the Central People's Government and ensure the realization of the entire issuance plan for the People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds. The person in charge of the preparatory committee of the city's trade union also said: The Shanghai working class warmly supports the Central People's Government's issuance of Victory Real Value Public Bonds, and is willing to work hard to thoroughly complete its issuance plan. The preparatory committee of the Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce held a grand symposium on December 10. More than 120 representatives from more than 70 industries in the city's industrial and commercial circles spoke enthusiastically at the meeting and unanimously supported the People's Government's decision to issue real value public bonds. Pan Yuanquan, director of the preparatory committee, said: The government's issuance of Victory Real Value Public Bonds is a practical and wise measure that not only solves the country's financial difficulties, but also takes care of the interests of the people. Financial stability and price stability will result, and industry and commerce can achieve smooth development and prosperity. He said that when the government officially issues public bonds, the industrial and commercial circles should take the lead in purchasing them. A pre-purchase campaign is already being actively brewing in various agencies in the city. The preparatory committee of the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions also issued a message calling on all workers and staff in the Northwest to actively purchase public bonds and actively carry out the production and economy movement. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Federation of Trade Unions, the Representatives of All Circles, the Youth League Committee, the Women's Federation, and the Student Federation have all successively issued calls to mobilize party members, members, league members, and people from all walks of life in the city to actively purchase Victory Public Bonds. The presidium of the Shanxi Provincial Congress of Literary and Art Workers called on all representatives to carry out publicity in various forms to promote the purchase of public bonds by people from all walks of life. Youth and women's organizations in Shijiazhuang called on the city's youth and women to work hard to save and promote the purchase of public bonds.
    The Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions called on the province's 320,000 workers to take the attitude of the leading class, give full play to their initiative, increase production, reduce costs, increase social wealth, reduce national expenditures, and actively purchase Victory Real Value Public Bonds. At the symposium of industrial and commercial circles in Kaifeng, the capital of Henan Province, Zhu Jingzhi said: The government's issuance of public bonds is the best way to balance revenue and expenditure and stabilize prices. Only when prices are stable can business be good. Zhai Xizhen said: The People's Government has begun construction before the revolutionary war is completely over. After the issuance of public bonds, the construction work will definitely be faster and better. I will definitely take out profits to purchase public bonds.
