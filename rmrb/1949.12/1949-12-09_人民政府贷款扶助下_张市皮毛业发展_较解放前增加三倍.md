　　With People's Government Loan Support
  　Zhangjiakou Fur Industry Develops
  　Tripling Pre-Liberation Levels
    [This newspaper reports] The renowned Zhangjiakou fur industry, under the multifaceted support of the People's Government, has rapidly developed from its pre-liberation state of decline. In the ten months since liberation, the number of fur businesses has increased by 52, and the import of raw hides has more than tripled compared to before liberation. Zhangjiakou is a distribution center for Northwest fur trade. Apart from various wools and some raw hides being exported to Europe and America via Beijing and Tianjin, most hides are processed in Zhangjiakou's fur factories and workshops. The peak period for Zhangjiakou's fur industry was in 1929, when the city had twelve fur trade guilds, totaling 704 businesses, employing 31,200 people. The import volume included 7,530,000 hides, 13,500,000 jin of wool, and 300,000 jin of bristles. Thereafter, due to the relentless destruction by the Kuomintang reactionary government and the Japanese invaders after the War of Resistance, Zhangjiakou's fur industry steadily declined. During the three years after the Kuomintang reactionaries launched the anti-people war, Zhangjiakou's fur industry suffered even more miserably. In 1948, the import of hides decreased by 92% compared to 1929, while wool and bristles decreased by 90%. By the time of liberation, Zhangjiakou's fur industry had only six trades with 198 businesses, employing 892 people. Because the fur industry is one of Zhangjiakou's main industries, its prosperity or decline is closely related to domestic and foreign trade, the exchange of goods in Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia, and the strength of the purchasing power of the people in Chahar Province. Therefore, the government has given it much support since liberation. In the past ten months, the bank has successively provided loans of 167 million yuan to support the fur, leather, rawhide, and leather-making industries. The Zhangjiakou branch of the North China Fur Company has repeatedly organized local private factories to process fur and purchased finished goods from private fur manufacturers, thereby enabling Zhangjiakou's fur industry to recover and develop from the stagnant state under the rule of the enemy, puppets, and Kuomintang reactionaries. The number of fur businesses has increased from 198 at the time of liberation to 250, and the number of employees has increased from 892 at the time of liberation to 1,376. The import volume of fur has greatly increased. According to statistics from the Fur Company, from January to the end of September (including public and private fur businesses), the import volume included 254,338 hides and 1,965,723 jin of wool. The import volume of private manufacturers alone is three times that of pre-liberation levels. In the future, with the support of the state-owned economy, if efforts can be made to improve technology, expand equipment, and adopt new management methods, Zhangjiakou's fur industry will develop more rapidly.

　　人民政府贷款扶助下
  　张市皮毛业发展
  　较解放前增加三倍
    【本报讯】著名全国的张家口市皮毛业，在人民政府的多方扶助下，已由解放前一蹶不振的状态迅速发展起来。解放十个月来，皮毛业户数已增加五十二户，输入皮张巴达解放前三倍多。张家口是西北皮毛贸易集散地，除各种毛类与部分生皮经京津出口销往欧美各国外，大部皮类都在张市的皮毛工厂及作坊加工。一九二九年为张市皮毛业的极盛时期，当时全市有皮毛业十二行共七○四户，从业人员达三一、二○○人。输入各种皮子七、五三○、○○○张，毛绒一三、五○○、○○○斤，猪鬃三○○、○○○斤。此后因国民党反动政府及抗战后日寇的百般摧残，张市皮毛业即每况愈下。至国民党反动派发动反人民战争后的三年间，张家口的皮毛业就更凄惨了。一九四八年输入的皮子较一九二九年减低了百分之九十二，毛绒及猪鬃均较前减低百分之九十。至解放前，张市的皮毛业仅有六个行业一九八户，从业人员八九二人。由于皮毛业是张市的主要行业之一，皮毛业之盛衰对国内外贸易，对绥蒙的物资交流，和察北群众生产购买力的强弱均有密切关系，故解放后政府即多予以扶助，十个月来，银行先后货款十六万七千余万元，扶助了毛裘、皮毛、粗皮、制革等业。华北皮毛公司张市分公司数度组织该市私营工厂加工，并收购各私营皮毛厂商的成货，从而使张市皮毛业由敌伪和国民党反动派统治时的停滞状态，获得了恢复和发展。皮毛厂商由解放时的一九八户增至二五○户，从业人员由解放时的八九二人增至一、三七六人；皮毛输入量较前大有增加，据皮毛公司统计：从一月至九月末（公私营皮毛业在内），输入各种皮张二五四、三三八张，各种绒毛一、九六五、七二三斤，其中私营厂商输入的数字即达解放前三倍。今后在国营经济的扶助下，如能努力改进技术，扩大设备，采取新的经营方式，则张市皮毛业当愈加迅速向前发展。
