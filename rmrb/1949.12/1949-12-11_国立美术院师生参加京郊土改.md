　　National Art Academy Teachers and Students Participate in Land Reform in the Suburbs of Beijing
    [Beijing News] Feng Fasi, Ai Zhongxin, Li Hua and eleven other professors and over a hundred students from the National Art Academy (formerly Beijing Art School) requested to participate in the land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing. After consultation between the school authorities and the preparatory committee of the Beijing Suburban Farmers' Association, it was decided to divide the teachers and students participating in the land reform into twenty-four groups, with the district team headquarters as the core of leadership, and merge with the original land reform work groups in the southern suburbs (District 14) and western suburbs (District 16) to work together. In order to understand the land reform policy and the method of class division before the land reform, the teachers and students specially invited Chai Zemin, secretary of the Beijing Suburban Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to the school on the 7th and 10th to give a report, and held heated discussions after listening to the report. They have decided to go to the countryside on the 13th. The teachers and students participating in the work are all very excited about the land reform and are eager to temper and transform themselves in this historically significant revolutionary movement.

　　国立美术院师生参加京郊土改
    【北京讯】国立美术学院（原北京艺术专科学校）冯法祀、艾中信、李桦等十一位教授和百余同学要求参加京市郊区土地改革工作。经该校当局与京市郊区农会筹委会商洽结果，决定将该院参加土改的师生分成二十四个小组，设区队部为领导核心，与南郊（十四区）西郊（十六区）原有土改工作组合并工作。该校师生为了在土改前先了解土改政策及划阶级方法，特于七日及十日请中共北京市郊委书记柴泽民到校报告，并在听取报告后展开热烈讨论。他们已决定十三日下乡。参加工作师生，对土地改革都感到莫大兴奋，热望能在这一富有历史意义的革命运动中锻炼与改造自己。
