　　Traitor and Spy Kostov
    The traitor and spy Kostov and his ilk were arrested on July 25th this year, following a resolution passed by a special session of the Bulgarian National Assembly, authorizing the Chief Prosecutor to arrest them. This was because they were employed by American, British, and Yugoslavian intelligence agencies to conspire to subvert the people's democratic regime. This is a link in the rebellion network set up by the imperialist camp in people's democratic countries. Following the Rajk case in Hungary and the Linder case in Czechoslovakia, this rebellion network, painstakingly deployed by the imperialist camp, has been shattered and will soon be completely eliminated. In March of this year, Sofia held a trial of espionage cases, the defendants of which were mostly those who illegally profited and speculated in currency under the direct command of foreign bosses. In their confessions, they clearly told the people of the world that those who directed these petty criminals to disrupt the market were precisely the "gentlemen of Wall Street and the City of London," including Blake, the secretary of the American political mission to Bulgaria in 1944-45, Baker, the American Commercial Counselor, Colonel Thompson, the head of the American military mission, and Andrews of the British mission. These imperialist elements, nominally diplomatic representatives but actually spy commanders, have already been spurned and expelled by the people. Naturally, they are not reconciled and will continue to plot sabotage, but what they will encounter will be even more severe defeat.

　　叛徒间谍科斯托夫
    科斯托夫这一起叛徒间谍分子，是今年七月二十五日，由保加利亚国民议会特别会议通过了国民议会主席团的决议，授权检查长将他们逮捕的。因为他们为美英及南斯拉夫谍报机关所雇用，阴谋颠覆人民民主政权。这是帝国主义阵营在人民民主国家布置的叛乱网的一环。继匈牙利的拉伊克案、捷克的李德纳案以后，帝国主义阵营苦心布署的这回叛乱网已被打得粉碎，将要很快消灭净尽了。在今年三月间，索非亚曾举行过一次审讯间谍案，被告们多是那些在外国老板们直接指挥下的非法牟利及货币投机者。在他们的口供中，清楚地告诉世界人民，指挥这些宵小分子进行捣乱市场的人们，正是那些“华尔街与伦敦城的绅士们”，其中有一九四四——五年美国驻保加利亚政治使团秘书布莱克，美国商务参赞拜克，美国军事使团团长汤姆逊上校，英国使团的安德鲁斯。这一批名义上是外交代表，实际上是间谍指挥人的帝国主义分子们，业已遭到了人民的脱唾弃与驱逐。自然，他们是不甘心的，还要继续图谋破坏，然而他们所碰到的，将是更严重的失败。
