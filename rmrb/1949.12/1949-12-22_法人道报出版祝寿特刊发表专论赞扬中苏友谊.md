Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 21st: TASS reports: L'Humanité published a special issue on the 18th to celebrate Stalin's birthday, which was sold in Paris by hundreds of volunteer news vendors. The front page of the special issue featured a huge portrait of Stalin, with the huge headline: "Long Live Stalin!" The editorial written by Thorez dedicated to Comrade Stalin's seventieth birthday was also titled the same. The special issue also contained an article by L'Humanité's Moscow correspondent, Elmit, visiting Stalin's birthplace, Gori, and an article by Monmousseau, secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, recounting his first trip to the Soviet Union twenty-five years ago and his meeting with Stalin. Volunteer news vendors accompanied the Sunday L'Humanité special issue with a booklet describing the various stages of Stalin's life, activities, and struggles, with illustrations, and the cover of the booklet was printed with Comrade Stalin's photo.
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 21st: On the 20th, the French Communist Party's L'Humanité published a photograph in the upper left corner of the cover, in the most prominent position, of Chairman Mao arriving at the Yaroslavsky Railway Station in Moscow, being greeted by Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Molotov and Marshal Bulganin, and reviewing the Soviet military honor guard. On the same day, the newspaper published an essay by Pierre Courtade entitled "Sino-Soviet Friendship." The author said: "Mao Zedong's arrival in Moscow is not only the leader of a great friendly people being received by the Soviet leaders, but also Comrade Mao Zedong coming to pay tribute to Comrade Stalin, and to express the love and gratitude of a fighting Communist to the teacher of all Communists and all mankind."
Speaking of the Chinese Communist Party and its victory, the author said: The Chinese Communist Party is a mature party that has undergone nearly thirty years of legal, illegal, and semi-legal struggles, and is a party that has always been based on loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism. Mao Zedong used a few words to summarize the principles of the victorious action of the Chinese people's forces: "Summarizing our experience, it boils down to one point, which is the people's democratic dictatorship based on the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class (through the Communist Party)." Mao Zedong said: "This is our formula, this is our main experience, this is our main program."
The author pointed out: "This is also Lenin and Stalin's formula, experience, and program." And said: "Because of such a theory, the Chinese revolution was able to defeat foreign imperialists and domestic reactionaries. This theory proves to be much more powerful than the US dollar. Because of this theory, through this theory, the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union has been established. Yesterday, Moscow Radio announced without hesitation that this friendship will make the socialist camp invincible."

　　法人道报出版祝寿特刊发表专论赞扬中苏友谊
    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：人道报为庆祝斯大林寿辰于十八日出版特刊，并由数百名志愿的报贩在巴黎出售。特刊首页刊载了斯大林的巨幅肖象，标着：“斯大林万岁！”的巨大标题。多列士所写的献给斯大林同志七十大庆的社论，亦以此为题。特刊并载有人道报驻莫斯科记者艾尔米特访问斯大林诞生地哥里的文章和法国总工会书记蒙摩安叙述他在二十五年前首次赴苏联旅行及会晤斯大林的文章。志愿报贩随星期日人道特刊赠送叙述斯大林的生活、活动与斗争的各个阶段并附有图解的小册子，小册子的封面印有斯大林同志的照片。
    【新华社布拉格二十一日电】法共人道报二十日于封面左上角以最显著地位，刊载毛主席到达莫斯科雅罗斯拉夫车站时与到站欢迎的苏联部长会议副主席莫洛托夫和布尔加宁元帅检阅苏军仪仗队的照片。同日，该报发表比埃尔·古尔塔德所作的题为“中苏友谊”的论文。作者说：“毛泽东到了莫斯科，这不仅是一个伟大友邦人民的领袖被苏联领袖们所接待，也是毛泽东同志来向斯大林同志来向斯大林同志致敬，并向他表示一个战斗的共产党员对一切共产党员与全人类导师的爱戴与感激。”
    谈到中国共产党及其胜利时，作者说：中国共产党是一个经过将近三十年的合法、非法和半合法斗争的成熟了的政党，是一个向来建立在忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则上的党。毛泽东用了几句话总结了中国人民力量胜利行动的原则：“总结我们的经验，集中到一点，就是工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政”。毛泽东说：“这就是我们的公式，这就是我们的主要经验，这就是我们的主要纲领。”
    作者指出：“这也是列宁斯大林的公式、经验和纲领”。并说：“由于这样一个理论，中国革命才能打倒外国帝国主义者和国内反动派。这个理论证明比美金厉害得多。由于这个理论，通过这个理论，中苏两个伟大民族的友谊，就建立起来了。昨天莫斯科广播毫不犹豫地宣布，这一友谊将使社会主义阵营成为无敌。”
