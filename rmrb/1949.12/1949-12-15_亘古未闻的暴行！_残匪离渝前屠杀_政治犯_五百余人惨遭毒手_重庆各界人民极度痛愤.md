　　Unprecedented Atrocities!
  　Remnant Bandits Massacre "Political Prisoners" Before Fleeing Chongqing
  　Over Five Hundred People Perish Tragically
    People of All Circles in Chongqing Express Extreme Grief and Indignation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Before fleeing Chongqing, the Kuomintang secret agent bandit gang, with unprecedentedly cruel methods, massacred over five hundred political prisoners in concentration camps. Among the identified dead, in addition to some Communist Party members, were also Huang Xiansheng, a former subordinate of General Zhang Xueliang and former Kuomintang army commander, Zhou Junshi, former president of Tongji University and renowned scientist, Wang Bai, former president of Chongqing Xinshu Newspaper, as well as many other figures from cultural and journalistic circles and young students. The location of the massacre was within the "Sino-American Cooperation Institute" concentration camp on the western outskirts of Chongqing, at Ciqikou and the foot of Mount Gele. This concentration camp stretched for twenty li, surrounded entirely by desolate mountains and wild grasses, with strict security, and its inner workings were never revealed. After the liberation of Chongqing, the truth of this murderous lair was brought to light. According to survivors who narrowly escaped the butcher's knife, the last major massacre in this concentration camp occurred on the night of November 27th, three days before the liberation of Chongqing. The bandits carried out the massacre in three separate locations: "One location was 'Baigongguan' (originally the residence of an old soldier named Bai Ju, later occupied by bandits), which was the detention center for 'key' political prisoners. Thirty-five people were bound and executed by shooting at this location. Huang Xiansheng, Zhou Junshi, and Wang Bai were killed here. Another location was 'Zhazidong,' about three li from 'Baigongguan.' Over two hundred political prisoners were imprisoned there. Initially, the bandits still bound them separately and executed them by shooting, but later, fearing political prisoners' riots and escapes, they used the most brutal methods to kill them inside the cells. They first swept the cells with carbine rifles, then entered the rooms and shot them individually. Finally, they set fire to burn the corpses and houses together. To this day, the corpses of hundreds of victims are charred, with incomplete limbs, a tragic sight. The third location was near the residence of the deceased secret agent chief Dai Li (now named 'Dai Gongci'). Thirty-two people were shot to death by random gunfire. This group of victims was originally imprisoned in the New World Hotel in the city. The bandits transported them here by car, shot them randomly, and pushed them into pre-dug earthen pits. The death toll in the above three locations is about three hundred people. Adding the political prisoners killed in the recent one or two months, the total reaches over five hundred. People from all walks of life in Chongqing are extremely grieved and indignant about this. Every day, people flock to the site of the martyrdom to pay their respects and search for the remains of relatives and friends. Currently, the Chongqing Military Control Commission has organized a liaison office and a funeral committee to register survivors, comfort the families of the deceased, and collect evidence of various atrocities committed by the secret agents, preparing to accuse them to the whole of China and the world."

　　亘古未闻的暴行！
  　残匪离渝前屠杀“政治犯”
  　五百余人惨遭毒手
    重庆各界人民极度痛愤
    【新华社重庆十四日电】国民党特务匪帮在逃离重庆前，以亘古未闻的残忍手段，屠杀集中营内五百余名政治犯。已查明之死者，除若干共产党员外，尚有张学良将军的旧部曾任国民党军长的黄显声，前同济大学校长著名科学家周均时，前重庆新蜀报社长王白与及其他许多文化界、新闻界人士和青年学生。大屠杀地点在重庆西郊磁器口与歌乐山麓的“中美合作所”集中营内。这集中营纵横长达二十里，周围尽属荒山野草，警戒森严，其内幕从未泄露。重庆解放后，这座杀人魔窟的真相乃得大白天下，据在屠刀下侥幸逃生者说，此集中营最后一次大屠杀发生于重庆解放前三天——十一月二十七日深夜，匪徒分别在三处执行屠杀，“一处在‘白公馆’（原来一个旧军人白驹的住宅，后被匪住用），该处为“首要”政治犯的监禁处，在此处被绑出枪决三十五人，黄显声、周均时、王白与即在此遇害。另一处为“渣滓洞”，距“白公馆”约三里。该处囚禁政治犯二百余人，匪徒最初尚分别绑出枪决，后因恐惧政治犯暴动和逃跑，乃以最残酷之手段就室内处死，先以卡宾枪向各囚室扫射，再入室分别射杀，最后纵火将尸体及房屋一齐烧毁，至今数百死者尸体焦黑，股体不全，惨不忍睹。第三处为已故特务头子戴笠住宅（现名“戴公祠”）的附近，被乱枪射杀者三十二人。这批牺牲者原来被囚禁于城内新世界饭店，匪徒以汽车载到此处，乱枪射杀后推入预先挖好的土坑中。以上三处死难者约三百人，加上最近一二月被杀的政治犯在内，共达五百人以上。重庆各界人民对此异常痛愤，每日赴殉难地点凭吊及找寻亲友遗体者络绎不绝。现重庆市军管会已组织联络处及治丧委员会，登记脱险者，抚慰死难者家属，并搜集各种特务暴行的证据，准备向全中国全世界控诉。
