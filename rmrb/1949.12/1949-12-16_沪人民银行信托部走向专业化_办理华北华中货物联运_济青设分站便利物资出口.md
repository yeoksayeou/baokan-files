The Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China Trust Department, in order to promote the exchange of goods and to specialize trust business, has established an intermodal transport section to be responsible for agency transportation and customs declaration business. To meet actual needs, it has first begun handling freight intermodal transport in the North China and Central China regions. Currently, transportation between Shanghai and Jinan is smooth, and full-truckload cargo on the Jinan-Qingdao section can be transported smoothly. The department has now begun dispatching personnel to establish branches in Jinan and Qingdao to be specifically responsible for handling export intermodal transport business. As for domestic sales materials, recently the exchange of goods between Shanghai and North China, Wuhan, Qingdao, Anhui and other places has been frequent, and the department has actively launched intermodal transport business. In the South China region, it will start handling business when conditions are ripe.

It is also learned that the scope of agency transportation and customs declaration by the department's intermodal transport section is divided into three types: short-distance within the city, domestic and international water and land, and domestic and international air transport. Those who entrust transportation and customs declaration should, after contacting the department and reaching an agreement, fill out a "Consignment and Customs Declaration Entrustment Form" together with various relevant documents and submit them to the department for agency. All expenses shall be paid by the client. If the client fails to pay or does not pay enough, the department will pay on their behalf, and the interest on the advance payment will be calculated according to the bank's prescribed interest rate. However, if the consignee refuses to accept the goods or no one accepts them, the client shall handle it themselves.
