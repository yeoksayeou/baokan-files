　　Fascist America
    Lin Moqing
    The United States' descent into fascism has been a general trend in the years since the war. Let's look at some recent events.

    First, the right to assembly. In November 1949, when the Chinese Workers Mutual Aid Association of San Francisco convened a meeting of 400 members to celebrate the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in South China, before the main speaker had even begun to speak, 40 thugs suddenly burst into the meeting place, threw lead pipes, eggs, and bottles filled with blue dye, beat the audience, and destroyed the venue.

    When the famous African-American singer Paul Robeson attended a concert in New York, thugs wielding clubs rushed into the venue, and the concert was forced to stop. But what is even more noteworthy is that a few days later, Robeson, under the protection of some people, returned to that place and held another concert. For this second concert, New York Governor Dewey took the trouble to order his judge to investigate the incident. The judge's task was not to investigate how the thugs disrupted the meeting, but to investigate whether the people who protected Robeson from attack would constitute an "illegal private militia." In Governor Dewey's eyes, only the former is important - the freedom to protect the activities of thugs versus the freedom of Robeson to sing.

    Let's talk about the right to associate. In Tallapoosa, Georgia, a Mrs. Martin, who voluntarily served as a Textile Workers Union organizer for the CIO, was kidnapped one day by several thugs (four men and five women), tied up, driven out of town, gagged, and finally warned: "Don't come back to town, or you'll be shot on the spot."

    Now let's turn to the right to strike. The workers of the American Zinc Company in East St. Louis, Illinois, have been on strike for eleven months. During this long strike, the company openly hired many strikebreaking thugs to suppress the workers. Shootings, explosions, and beatings were constantly occurring. On May 26th, two union staff members were killed by these thugs. A few days later, as 300 striking workers were marching, the same group of thugs used weapons to disperse the march, and as a result of live ammunition firing, two striking workers were seriously injured. Only under the pressure of public opinion did the local police finally have to take action, and the main culprits were arrested and imprisoned, but a few hours later, they were bailed out by their employers with money. In Tacoma, Washington, a group of strikebreaking thugs beat striking picketers with baseball bats, brass knuckles, and pistols. When the picketers notified the police authorities, the police delayed for forty-five minutes before arriving, by which time the thugs had already broken through the picket line and fled.

    Most strangely, it is forbidden to hang a portrait of Roosevelt. A San Francisco painter, Reverly, displayed a portrait of President Roosevelt at the San Francisco Conference. A few days later, he received orders to remove the portrait, otherwise he would be in danger of losing his job. Because the American authorities believe that Roosevelt has become too "controversial" a figure today and is no longer a "highly respected" leader.

    Speaking of freedom of belief, American civil servants are undergoing unprecedented "loyalty investigations." As early as 1943, The New Republic magazine disclosed a series of questions from the FBI, and these questions are still being cited today. Every civil servant must pass these questions, which include: Does he often associate with black people? Does he support cooperatives? Has he ever campaigned for a union? Has he criticized the House Un-American Activities Committee? Does he stay up late at night? Has he opposed the poll tax? Does he hire Jews?

    From these things, we can see to what extent the fascism of the United States has reached.

### 在法西斯化的美国

　　在法西斯化的美国
    林墨卿
    美国走上法西斯，已是战后几年来的一个总的趋势了。我们看最近发生的一些事吧。
    先说集会的权利。一九四九年十一月，当旧金山中国工人互助协会召集会员四百人的大会，庆祝中国人民解放军在华南的胜利时，主要发言人还没有开始演讲，四十个暴徒突然撞进到会场里面来，用抛掷铅管、鸡蛋和装满蓝色染料的瓶子，殴打观众，并且捣毁了会场。
    著名的美国黑人歌王罗伯逊一次出席美国纽约某地的音乐会时，挥动着棍棒的匪徒们冲进会场，音乐会为之停开。但值得人们注意的，却还不在于此，因为几天以后，罗伯逊在一些人的保护之下，又回到那个地方，重新举行一次音乐会了。为了这第二次音乐会，纽约州长杜威却不惮厌烦地，命令他的法官进行调查这一事件。法官的任务，不是调查暴徒如何捣乱会场，而是调查保护罗伯逊免受攻击的人们，是否将构成“非法的私人的民兵”。保护暴徒活动的自由与保护罗伯逊歌唱的自由这两件事，在杜威州长的眼里，只有前者是重要的。
    再谈结社的权利吧。在乔治亚城的泰拉普萨，一个自愿担任产联纺织工人工会组织者的马丁夫人，在某一天遭遇到几个暴徒的（四男五女）绑架，手脚都被捆起来赶出城去，嘴里并且塞上物品，最后得到的警告是：不能够再回到城里去，“否则你就要被当场枪毙。”
    然后让我们转来看看罢工的权利吧。伊里诺州东圣易斯地方美国锌公司的工人，已经举行历时十一个月之久的罢工了，在这冗长的罢工期间，公司方面公开雇用了很多破坏罢工的暴徒，来镇压工人。枪杀、爆炸和殴打是经常不断发生的，五月二十六号那天，就有两个工会工作人员，牺牲在这批暴徒的手里。几天以后，三百名罢工工人正在举行游行时，同一批暴徒又用武装冲散了这次游行，实弹射击的结果，两名罢工工人受到重伤。仅在舆论的压力下，地方警察最后才不得不被迫采取行动，主犯被捕并且监禁起来了，但是，几小时以后，他们又被他们的雇主用金钱保释出来。在华盛顿的塔柯玛地方，一群破坏罢工的匪徒，用垒球棒、铜铗和手枪等，殴打正在罢工的纠察队，当纠察队通知警察当局以后，警察耽搁了四十五分钟才来，那时，这批匪徒早已冲破纠察线，而远走高飞了。
    最奇的，莫如不许悬挂罗斯福画像。旧金山的一个画家雷佛利哲，陈列一幅罗斯福总统在旧金山会议上的画像，几天以后，就接到命令要把画像移去，否则将遭受到失业的危险。因为美国官方认为罗斯福今天已经变成一个太容易“惹起议论”的人物，不再是一位“极尊荣”的领袖了。
    讲到信仰自由，则美国的公务员们正在经历着史无前例的“忠诚调查”，早在一九四三年，新共和杂志就曾披露联邦调查局的一系列问题，一直到今天，这些问题还是被援引着的。每个公务员都须在这些问题的考验中及格，它们包括：他是不是常与黑人在一起？他是不是支持合作社？他是不是曾经为工会进行宣传？他是否批评过非美委员会？他是否一直到深夜还不睡觉？他是否反对过人头税？他是否雇用犹太人？
    从这些事情，可以窥见美国的法西斯化已经到了什么样的程度了。
