　　Think More for the Children
    Ling Bing
    After watching "The Adventures of San Mao the Orphan," I heard a mother, holding her child's hand, say in the crowd heading for the exit: "San Mao is really unlucky!"
    Clearly, she was not referring to San Mao's failure to be a good son to the thieving couple, or being stripped of his clothes and driven back to the streets after being terrified. Rather, she expressed regret at San Mao's unwillingness to live the luxurious life of the "Kong-Soong family" and his decisive abandonment of the opportunity to be "Little Lord Fauntleroy."
    Here, it naturally reflects that the speaker, and some of the people she represents, still have a class-based exploitative consciousness in their minds. They only seek the luxury and joy of their own lives, disregarding the fact that this luxury and joy is built on the hunger and suffering of millions, even thinking it should be so. These people will naturally not pay attention to how to correctly educate children, so that the next generation, who can no longer be "Kong-Soongs" under the rule of the liberated people, can grow up healthily, establish new moral viewpoints, and thus become useful people welcomed by the people in the future. This mother, naturally, did not think about how much influence her one sentence would have on her child's small mind.
    We acknowledge that for people who have grown up in the old society for decades, especially those from the exploiting class, a thorough transformation of their thinking is a rather long and difficult process. Beijing has been liberated for less than a year, and we cannot demand the same level of progress from everyone; in daily life and conversations, it is inevitable that some exploiting class consciousness will be revealed from time to time. However, for the future of the next generation, to protect them, to think more for the children, it should be easy to understand now, and it should be the time to start.
    At the same time, this mother's thoughts also reflect the possible thoughts of the children. Isn't the Kong family's life good? Although "Kong Guohao" doesn't like San Mao, the wife "Song Shoumei" insists on having San Mao. Relying on the influence of his wife's brother, the "Chairman of the Board," Kong Guohao would never dare to mistreat San Mao. He has servants attending to him, wears good clothes, eats good food, has toys, has a tutor, learns music, and hosts banquets for San Mao... San Mao doesn't like any of these things – but these are all things that urban children who can see "The Adventures of San Mao the Orphan" like. San Mao is willing to "suffer" with his poor friends – but this is not necessarily what the children watching the movie are willing to do. They might think: "San Mao is really unlucky!"
    This involves the film itself. Compared to the handling of the thieving couple, "The Adventures of San Mao the Orphan" is relatively negligent in handling the Kong-Soong family. We can clearly see the sinfulness and shamefulness of the thieving couple's life, and San Mao has no joy or benefit there. But what I saw of the Kong-Soong family was only the superficial vulgarity and luxury of life, but it could not clearly show the essence of sin, nor could it show what harm it did to San Mao himself. A group of poor children broke into the Kong family, ate some food, made a fuss for a while, and then nothing else happened; and the Kong family was still the Kong family. Later, when Shanghai was liberated, there was no combination with the liberation of the working people to give the Kong-Soong family a deserved and appropriate treatment, so that people could deeply see the sinfulness of the Kong-Soong family, see the shameful essence of that kind of life, and prove that the path San Mao took was completely correct.
    I think this is a big flaw in "The Adventures of San Mao the Orphan." Even if adults can intellectually infer the sins and consequences of the Kong-Soong family, it should be written out in more depth in the film. And children need to recognize it from a perceptual point of view. Thinking more for the children is also necessary here.

　　多替孩子们想想
    凌冰
    看完了“三毛流浪记”，在拥向出口的人群中，我听到一个牵着孩子的母亲说：“三毛真没福气！”
    显然，她不是指的三毛没有很好地给偷盗夫妇做儿子，在饱受惊吓之后，被剥掉衣服赶回马路。而是对三毛不安于过“孔宋之家”的豪华生活，决然地放弃了做“汤姆小少爷”的机会的作为，很表示遗憾。
    在这里，很自然地反映了说话的人和她所代表的一些人们脑子里，还存在着阶级的剥削意识。但求一己生活的豪华欢乐，对这种豪华和欢乐建筑在千万人的饥饿和痛苦的基础之上的事实，却置之不顾，甚而认为应该如此。这些人自然不会注意到怎样正确地去教育孩子，使已经不可能在翻了身的人民的政权之下再做“孔、宋”的下一代，自小儿健全起来，建立新的道德观点，从而将来成为一个有用的人，为人民所欢迎的人。这位母亲，自然也没有想到，她的这一名话，会给与孩子细小的心灵以多大的影响，
    我们承认，在旧社会里生长了几十年的人，特别是出身于剥削阶级的人，思想的彻底改造是一个相当长期而艰难的过程。北京解放不到一年，我们不能对每一个人的进步都要求一般高；在日常生活和谈话中，难免有时流露些剥削阶级的意识。但是，为了下一代的未来，为了爱护他们，在孩子们面前，多替孩子们想想，现在也该是很容易明白的事情了，也该是开始的时候了。
    同时，这位母亲的想法也反映了孩子们可能有的想法。孔家的生活不是很好么？尽管“孔国豪”不喜欢三毛，而太太“宋瘦梅”却非要三毛不可。仗着太太的哥哥“董事长”的势力，孔国豪绝不敢亏待三毛。有仆人前呼后拥的侍候，穿好吃好，有玩具，有家庭教师，学习音乐，为三毛宴客，……三毛对这一切东西都不喜欢——而这些却都是能够看到“三毛流浪记”的城市小朋友们所喜欢的。三毛甘愿和穷朋友们一起去“受苦”——而这却不一定是看电影的小朋友们所乐意的。他们也许会想：“三毛真没福气！”
    这就牵涉到影片的本身。比起处理偷盗夫妇，在处理孔宋这一点上，“三毛流浪记”是比较疏忽的。我们可以明显地看到偷盗夫妇生活的罪恶可耻，三毛在那里没有一点快乐和好处。而我所看到的孔宋之家，只是表面的庸俗而奢华的生活，却不能明显地看到罪恶的本质，也看不出对于三毛本身有什么害处。一群穷孩子打进孔家，吃了东西，闹一阵之后，也再没有别的；而孔家依然是孔家。到后来上海解放了，也没有结合着劳动人民的解放而给孔宋一个应得的，适当的处理，使人们深入一层地看出孔宋的罪恶来，看出那种生活的可耻的本质来，并证明三毛所走的道路完全是正确的。
    我认为这是“三毛流浪记”的一个很大缺点。即使成年人可以从理智上推知孔宋的罪恶和下场，也应当在影片里较深入地写出来。而孩子更需要从感性上来认识它。多替孩子们想想，在这里也是必要的。
