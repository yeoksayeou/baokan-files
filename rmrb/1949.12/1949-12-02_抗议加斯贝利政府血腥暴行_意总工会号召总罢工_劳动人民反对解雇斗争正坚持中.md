Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 1st: TASS, Rome, 30th: The Executive Committee of the Italian General Confederation of Labor decided today to hold a 24-hour national general strike starting at 6:00 AM on December 1st, to protest the bloody atrocities of the police who massacred laboring people in Torremaggiore, Foggia province, in southern Italy. On November 29th, when laboring people in Foggia province held a general strike to protest the police's rule by club, the police attacked a people's gathering in Torremaggiore, opened fire on the masses, killing two laboring people on the spot and injuring many others.

  "Unità" called on the people of the whole country to "strongly protest the Gasperi government's acts of slaughtering laboring people."

  In addition, the struggle of the Italian laboring people against eliminating production and laying off workers continues to expand. Following the successful 24-hour strike by enterprises in Naples on November 23rd, laboring people in Terni city and Terni province in central Italy, responding to the call of the "Citizens' Committee for the Defense of Local Interests" (composed of representatives of all parties except the Christian Democratic Party), began another 24-hour general strike on the morning of the 28th, protesting the steel factory's layoff of 1,200 workers. Recently, the Waux Carylio factory in Livorno in north-central Italy, and the Magneti, Marelli, and Breda factories in Milan, have all held strikes. At the same time, the struggle of agricultural workers in northern Italy against layoffs and for collective contracts is still ongoing.

  　意总工会号召总罢工
    劳动人民反对解雇斗争正坚持中
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社罗马三十日讯：意大利总工会执委会今日决定自十二月一日上午六时起，举行二十四小时全国总罢工，抗议警察屠杀南部福查省托里马基奥劳动人民的血腥暴行。十一月二十九日当福查省劳动人民举行总罢工，抗议警察的大棍统治时，警察便进攻在托里马基奥的人民集会，对群众开枪，有两个劳动人民当场身亡，另多人受伤。
    “团结报”呼吁全国人民对“加斯贝利政府残杀劳动人民的行为，提出强力抗议”。
    又讯：意大利劳动人民抗议消灭生产、解雇工人的斗争，继续扩展。继那不勒斯各企业十一月廿三日举行廿四小时胜利罢工之后，中部特尔尼城和特尔尼省劳动人民，廿八日晨响应“公民保卫地方委员会”（由基督教民主党除外的一切党派代表组成）的号召，又开始二十四小时总罢工，抗议钢铁工厂解雇一千二百名工人。最近，意中北部里窝那的华克斯·卡里约工厂，米兰的马尼蒂、马勒利和布雷达诸大工厂，都曾举行罢工。与此同时，北意农业工人反解雇、争取集体合同的斗争，也仍在坚持中。
