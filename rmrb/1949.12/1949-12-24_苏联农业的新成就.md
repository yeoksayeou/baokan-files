　　New Achievements in Soviet Agriculture
  　　　　Stubble Mulch Wheat Planting Method
    One of the most difficult problems in Siberian agriculture, the planting of winter wheat, has been solved by the Michurin disciples, headed by Academician Lysenko. Before this, all attempts to grow winter wheat in Siberia had been unsuccessful because the wheat planted on cultivated land using ordinary methods would freeze to death. Scientists have confirmed that the only reliable way to prevent Siberian winter wheat from freezing to death is to use tractor-pulled disc drills to plant wheat in uncultivated land with wheat stubble left on it. This method can protect crops from the harmful effects of Siberian winds. Experiments conducted by the Siberian Grain Institute have shown that stubble mulch planting solves the problem of overwintering for rye and wheat on the open steppes of Siberia. Stubble can protect not only hardy varieties, but also any varieties from southern Ukraine, Crimea, Kuban, and other places. Farmers' recent experience shows that the yield of winter wheat in Siberia can reach as much as 3.3 tons per hectare. Last year, on 263 hectares of land, the average yield was 1.6 tons per hectare. Academician Lysenko believes that the method of planting winter wheat on stubble land has been well developed, and agricultural authorities and collective farms can set their own goals to expand the area of ​​winter wheat on the Siberian steppes to at least one million hectares in the coming years. After the widespread adoption of stubble mulch planting, Siberia will become a major supplier of winter wheat.
    　　　　Crop-Grass Rotation System
    This year, the most complete implementation of the crop-grass rotation system was achieved in all the fields of the Gaman Prairie. Although the spring climate was unfavorable, the result was still a bumper harvest on a huge production area, namely: 3,360 kg of autumn-sown rye, 3,050 kg of autumn-sown wheat, 1,630 kg of spring wheat, 3,050 kg of barley, and 2,500 kg of oats per hectare of land.
    In fields defended by forests, using the same agricultural techniques, the harvest was greatly increased compared to the undefended grasslands. The beneficial effect of forest defense increased the harvest, namely: an additional 360 kg of autumn-sown rye, 730 kg of autumn-sown wheat, 470 kg of spring wheat, 590 kg of oats, and 940 kg of barley were harvested per hectare of land.
    In individual sections of the land with forest-defended fields, the best grain harvest was 3,700 kg to 4,800 kg per hectare of land.
    Millet harvesting has begun on the fields of the Academy. In the first few days, an average of 4,000 kg of millet was harvested per hectare of land.

　　苏联农业的新成就
  　　　　留秸地小麦种植法
    西伯利亚农业中最困难的问题之一，种植冬季小麦问题，已经由以科学院会员黎仙柯为首的米邱林的弟子们给解决了。在此以前，想在西伯利亚种植冬季小麦的一切企图都没有效果，因为用平常的方法种在已耕地上，小麦就被冻死了。科学家已经证实，防止西伯利亚的冬小麦免于冻死的唯一可靠方法，就是用拖拉机牵引的圆盘播种机小麦种在留有麦秸的未耕地上。这个方法可以保护作物不受西伯利亚剧风的有害影响。西伯利亚谷物研究所所进行的实验表明，留秸地种植法给裸麦与小麦解决了在西伯利亚的空旷草原上过冬的问题。麦秸不仅可以保护耐寒的品种，也可以保护来自南方乌克兰、克里米亚、库班等地的任何品种。农民近年的经验表明，西伯利亚的冬季小麦的产量每公顷可达三点三吨之多。去年在二百六十三公顷的土地上，每公顷平均产麦一点六吨。科学院会员黎仙柯认为，在留秸地上种植冬季小麦的方法已经十分发展，农业机关和集体农庄可以自定目标，在今后数年内将西伯利亚草原上的冬季小麦面积扩展到至少一百万公顷。广泛采用了留秸地种植法以后，西伯利亚将变成冬季小麦的主要供应地了。
    　　　　庄稼牧草轮种制
    今年，在加曼纳草原所有的田野上，最完善地实现了庄稼牧草轮种制。春天的气候虽然不好，但结果还是在巨大的生产面积上获得了丰收，即：由一公顷土地上收了三千三百六十公斤秋播裸麦，三千零五十公斤秋播小麦，一千六百三十公斤春麦，三千零五十公斤大麦和二千五百公斤燕麦。
    在由森林防御的田野里，使用一样的农业技术，收获较比未防御的草原上是大大提高了。森林防御地之良好的影响使收获增加了，即：在每一公顷的土地上多收获了三百六十公斤秋播裸麦，七百三十公斤秋播小麦，四百七十公斤春麦，五百九十公斤燕麦和九百四十公斤大麦。
    在有森林防御田野之个别地段上，食粮收获最好的是在每一公顷的土地上收获了三千七百公斤至四千八百公斤。
    在该学院的田野上已开始收割黍子。在最初几天中，平均由一公顷土地上打了四千公斤黍子。
