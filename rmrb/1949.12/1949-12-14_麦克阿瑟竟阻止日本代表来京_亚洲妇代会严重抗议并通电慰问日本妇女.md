    Asian Women's Conference Strongly Protests and Sends Telegram of Condolences to Japanese Women
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th] The Asian Women's Representative Conference sent a telegram protesting the fact that the MacArthur Headquarters of the American Imperialist stationed in Japan refused to issue passports to prevent Japanese representatives from attending the conference. The telegram is as follows: MacArthur Headquarters, Tokyo
    We lodge a serious protest against your use of refusing to issue passports to prevent Japanese women from attending the Asian Women's Representative Conference. Japanese women and the Japanese people are working hard to establish an independent, democratic, and peaceful Japan. All your oppressive measures will ultimately not be able to stop the Japanese people from advancing.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th] The Asian Women's Representative Conference sent a telegram of condolence to Japanese women who were unable to send representatives to the Asian Women's Representative Conference due to MacArthur Headquarters' refusal to issue passports. The telegram is as follows: To the Japanese Women's Preparatory Committee for Participation in the Asian Conference, to the democratic women of Japan:
    The American occupation authorities have prevented you from attending the Asian Women's Representative Conference by refusing to issue passports. All our representatives express a serious protest to MacArthur Headquarters. The efforts of Japanese women and the Japanese people to oppose the United States' support for Japanese fascism and to turn Japan into a new war base, and to establish an independent, democratic, and peaceful Japan, are of great significance to Far Eastern and world peace. The Asian Women's Representative Conference pays tribute to the democratic women of Japan and wishes them success in their efforts.
