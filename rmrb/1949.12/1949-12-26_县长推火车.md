County Head Pushes Train
    Chai Renping

    The small train on the Handan-Changzhi Railway sped eastward. As it went beyond the foot of the Taihang Mountains, climbing the winding slope between Wu'an Station and Kangcheng Station (advancing one section and then retreating one section before going straight up), the engine's power was at full capacity. The "dada" sound reverberated through the sky, and black smoke billowed from the engine. However, the train's speed gradually decreased until it finally stopped.

    Two driver workers jumped off the train, followed by the ticket inspector. At this moment, three comrades in uniform jumped down from a coal car behind the engine. One of them asked with surprise, "Comrade, is there something wrong with the train? Are the passengers in danger? If there is danger, please ask the passengers to get off as soon as possible."

    The driver worker replied, "There is no danger. The reason the train stopped is because the number four engine is broken and attached to the back of the train. It weighs as much as several carriages, so it's a bit difficult to climb the big slope. We just need a few hands to push it up." As he spoke, they ran to the front and started scattering yellow soil on the tracks (to reduce the smoothness of the tracks). Understanding their intention, the three comrades also helped them scatter soil. After a while, a driver worker jumped onto the engine and started the machine. The railway workers went to both sides and started pushing. The three uniformed comrades also helped push with all their might.

    With a whistle and the engine at full power, coupled with the efforts of those pushing, the train rumbled slowly up the steep slope. Everyone was sweating from the exertion. The driver workers and railway staff thanked the three comrades, "Thank you for your trouble, comrades. Where do you work? Where are you going?" The comrade with a handgun said, "We are from the Wu'an County government. This is our county head, and this is our section chief. They are both going to the special commissioner's office for a meeting."

    The train continued eastward. After leaving Kangcheng Station and the ticket inspector collected the tickets from the three comrades, a passenger behind asked the ticket inspector at the carriage door, "Do your railway comrades still need tickets when they ride the train?"

    "They are not railway cadres. They are the county head and section chief of Wu'an."

    "Then why did they help you push the train?"

    "They not only helped us push the train, but as soon as the train stopped, they immediately came down and asked if the passengers were in danger!"

    The passenger said happily, "They are truly people's county heads, different from the past. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, would ordinary people be riding in a train while the county head and section chief were down pushing?"

    Another person, who looked like a farmer, said, "You must be from the new district, seeing this as very strange. We have seen many such things in the liberated areas in the past few years! High-ranking cadres helping the masses with harvesting, carrying manure, transporting grain... During the War of Resistance, many high-ranking cadres reclaimed wasteland on the mountains, their hands covered in blisters, bleeding, and still they continued to reclaim!..." Then, a woman holding a child interjected, "Ah! I remember now, it was them three at Wu'an Station. When they got on the train, they saw that the passenger seats were full, so they went to the coal car. A county head from the old days would probably not be willing to sit in a coal car, right?"

    A whistle interrupted everyone's discussion. A while later, the train arrived at Handan Station, and the three of them got off the train. The passengers in the carriage all watched them, but the three of them did not notice, each picking up their luggage and walking towards the city.

　　县长推火车
    柴任平
    邯长路上的小火车由西向东驰去，当它驰出太行山脚，到武安站至康城站中间的迂回坡头上坡时（上一节再退着上一节，然后再直上），马力开足了，哒哒的声音，响澈了天空，车头上的黑烟直冒，但是车行速度却由快到慢，最后终于停了下来。
    两个司机工人，跳下车去；押车的查票员，也接着下去。这时三个穿制服的同志，从车头后边一个炭车箱上跳下来，其中一个惊疑的问着：“同志，车出了毛病吗？乘客有危险没有？有危险可请乘客早些下来。”
    司机工人回答：“没危险，车停的原因是因为四号车头坏了，挂在这列车的后面。它顶好几个车皮重，所以上大坡就有些困难。只要搭上几把手推推就上去了。”说着他们几个就跑上前头，挖起黄土向铁道上撒去（减去铁道的光滑）。这三位同志领会了他们的意思，也去帮助着他们撒土。一会，一个司机工人跳上车去开动了车机，车务人员到两边开始推着；这三个着制服的同志也用力地帮着推。
    气笛一叫，马力开的足足的，加上推车人的努力，火车便轰隆轰隆的慢慢地开上了高坡。大家累的冒出汗来，司机工人和车务员都向这三个同志表示道谢：“麻烦你们了，同志。你们在那里工作？上那里去？”那个带手枪的同志说：“我们是武安县政府的，这是我们县长，这是我们科长，他们都到专署开会去。”
    火车又开向东去了。当开出康城车站，查票员收了这三个同志的票以后，后边一个乘客问车箱门口的那个查票员：“你们铁路上的同志坐车还打票吗？”
    “他们不是铁路上的干部，是武安的县长科长。”
    “那怎么还给你们推车呢？”
    “不光帮我们推车呢，刚才车一停下，他们马上下来，就关心乘客有没有危险呢！”
    这个乘客欣喜地说：“到底是人民的县长，与过去不同了。要是国民党反动时代那有老百姓坐着车，县长科长下去推的事。”
    另一个农民模样的人说道：“你是新区来的吧，对这事看的很奇怪。这几年来在解放区看到这类的事可多啦！大干部们帮助群众收割啦、担粪啦、背粮啦，……。在抗战时好多大干部在山上开荒，手上都磨起了泡，流着血，还要开呢！……”接着，一个抱孩子的妇人抢着说：“啊！想起来啦，在武安车站就是他们三个，上到车箱门口看了年人坐的满满的，他们就到那个炭车上了。要是旧时候的县长恐怕不肯去坐煤车吧！？”
    汽笛一叫，打断了大家的议论。一会儿火车到了邯郸车站，他们三个人下车了。车箱里的乘客都注视着他们，但他们三个人都未觉察，各拿起行李，向城里的方向走去。
