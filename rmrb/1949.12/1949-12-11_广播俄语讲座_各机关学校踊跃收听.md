Broadcast Russian Lectures
　　Various Organizations and Schools Enthusiastically Listen
　　[Beijing News] Since the broadcast Russian lectures jointly organized by the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station began, registration for listening has been extremely enthusiastic. As of the 10th, more than 90 units have registered collectively, with approximately 5,000 people. The Agricultural College of North China University in Shijiazhuang, which is far away, also has 400 people participating in the study collectively. Recently, the People's Broadcasting Station has received many calls from listeners every day, raising many questions. The teachers have answered them in each lecture. Leading comrades of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government took the lead in learning, with a total of more than 200 people participating; the teachers and students of Baiman Middle School studied together and established a sign-in system and learning rules. The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will soon issue a notice based on the current situation, hoping that all collective learning units will quickly organize themselves into groups and classes, persevere, and regularly report on their learning progress to the association.
