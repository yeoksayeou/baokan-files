Any land (excluding existing housing foundations) received or used by any agency, military unit, or school in the suburbs of this city is state-owned land. All military units, agencies, and schools occupying such land must send personnel with official documents, certificates, contracts, and written descriptions of the land's origin, acreage, usage, purpose, and income to the Municipal Government Suburban Work Committee at No. 36 Gongjian Hutong, Jingshan Back Street, before January 20, 1950, to register.
