　　On Beijing's Taxation

    The Second Session of the People's Representatives of All Circles in Beijing passed five proposals from the Beijing Municipal People's Government regarding fiscal taxation. These five proposals have elevated Beijing's fiscal taxation to a new stage: from a transitional stage of partial reform after liberation to a stage of implementing the tax policies of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. These five proposals mark the beginning of this new stage.

    I. The Recovery Period of "Supporting the City with the Countryside"

    At the beginning of liberation, the tax work adopted a policy of gradual improvement, temporarily using the old tax system and abolishing or adjusting those tax items and rates that urgently needed reform. In Beijing, for example, the original thirty-seven old tax items were initially reduced to twenty-one, and later to seventeen. Unreasonable levies and miscellaneous taxes were abolished, thus greatly reducing the burden on the people during the process of reorganizing the old taxes. The newly liberated areas suffered the Kuomintang's frenzied plunder and the damage of war, coupled with the significant changes in the relationship between urban and rural areas after the initial liberation. Industry and commerce needed a period of respite, recuperation, reorganization, and consolidation. During this period, tax reduction played a role in stabilizing order and restoring the economy.

    After liberation, Beijing's taxes were reduced. This is clearly shown in the tax revenue figures of the Beijing Municipal People's Government for the first half of 1949: only 270,000 jin of millet in February, gradually increasing each month, but only 5.8 million jin of millet by June, totaling 18.69 million jin. Compared with the 14.6 million jin of millet in September of the second half of the year, it is evident that the first half of the year was a period of economic recovery for Beijing. Further comparison with the situation before liberation: the municipal government's revenue in February 1948 was equivalent to 19.5 million jin of millet, and 16.8 million jin in September. Thus, the six months after liberation were indeed a period of recuperation and recovery for Beijing's economy.

    The light burden on the people of Beijing does not mean that the Beijing Municipal Government's expenditures were tightened. On the contrary, comparing expenditures, no month after liberation was lower than the previous year. From February to June 1948, the municipal government's expenditures totaled 25.59 million jin of millet, while expenditures during the corresponding period in 1949 totaled 42.75 million jin of millet. Reduced income and increased expenditure resulted in a deficit. After the liberation of Beijing, from February to June, the municipal government's average income only accounted for 43.7% of the average expenditure. This deficit was subsidized by the North China Government, in other words, subsidized by the vast number of peasants. This is the situation of "supporting the city with the countryside." This situation is only justifiable during the period of healing wounds but should not continue for a long time. Therefore, the amount of the deficit should gradually decrease with the economic recovery, which means that taxes should increase at the same rate as the economic recovery, until the goal of "supporting the city with the city" is achieved. Furthermore, to achieve urban leadership over the countryside economically, the city must be able to subsidize rural construction with urban revenue, which is "supporting the countryside with the city." This is the ultimate goal of urban construction.

    II. Heavier Burden on Those with More Income

    One of the purposes of the five tax proposals put forward by the Beijing Municipal Government is to increase revenue. Mayor Nie clearly stated in the last paragraph of his report to the People's Representatives Conference: "In order to realize the above-mentioned municipal construction, it is necessary to pay a considerable amount of expenses. Therefore, it is necessary to reorganize the tax system, and the burden on the citizens of Beijing cannot be reduced." Beijing has entered a stage of construction, so the municipal government's expenditure in the second half of the year will inevitably exceed that of the first half. The actual expenditure from February to June was 42.7 million jin of millet, while the estimated expenditure for the second half of the year totaled 95 million jin of millet, an increase of more than double. The income in the first half of the year was only 18.68 million jin of millet, so if the goal of balancing revenue and expenditure and supporting the city with the city is to be achieved in the second half of the year, the income must be increased fourfold. According to the estimated amount that can be collected in the second half of the year in the five proposals, it may be 62 million jin of millet. Even if other taxes are added, there may still be a considerable deficit. A portion of Beijing's construction still needs to be subsidized by the peasants.

    To maximize the goal of supporting the city with the city, the people of Beijing will have to bear four times the burden in the second half of the year compared to the first half. The question then is how to strengthen tax collection?

    When we talk about increasing taxes, we feel uncomfortable. This is the result of being subjected to reactionary rule for a long time. In the past, under reactionary rule, taxation was a tool for the reactionary government to plunder the people, so increasing taxes meant strengthening plunder. This is absolutely true. The reactionary government, in order to protect its own class interests, inevitably targeted the oppressed people for taxation. Not to mention the exorbitant taxes and levies, such as the pacification tax, protection tax, and military service fee familiar to the citizens of Beijing; even in terms of regular taxes, they always started by strengthening indirect taxes. Indirect taxes, such as commodity taxes, can be passed on by merchants to consumers. The most obvious are the commodity taxes on daily necessities such as grain, oil, and salt. When these commodity taxes are increased, the burden on the rich is proportionally lighter, while the burden on the poor is proportionally heavier. Direct taxes are different in nature from indirect taxes. Direct taxes are based on the amount of income. For example, property tax is only paid by those who own property, and those with more property pay more tax, while those without property have no burden. Under reactionary rule, direct taxes were never handled well because they were not in line with the interests of the ruling class. They were the propertied class and would not ask their own people for money. Under a people's democratic regime, the focus of taxation must be different; it should be placed on direct taxes.

    The five proposals on fiscal taxation by the Beijing Municipal People's Government implemented the tax policies of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The tax items proposed in these five proposals are: income tax and business tax on profit-making enterprises, property tax, land tax, agricultural tax, and an additional levy of primary school education fees and sanitation fees on the above-mentioned taxes. These are all direct taxes. This means that in the future, the expenses required by the Beijing Municipal People's Government in its administration and construction undertakings will be mostly borne by citizens with profit-making enterprises, property, land, and agricultural income, and those with higher incomes will bear a heavier burden, while those with lower incomes will bear a lighter burden.

    To make those with more income bear more of the municipal expenses, all the above-mentioned taxes adopted the principles of classification and progressive taxation. The income tax on profit-making enterprises is based on the amount of income to determine the tax rate. Those with a taxable amount of less than one point are exempt from tax, which provides care for many small businesses. From the tax exemption point to 1.5 million yuan, it is divided into twenty levels, with the tax rate increasing by 1% for each level. The level range below 1 million yuan is 100,000 yuan, and the level range above 1 million yuan is shortened to 50,000 yuan. Above 1.5 million yuan is the highest level, with an income tax of 25%. The principle of property tax is also the same. On the one hand, it is divided into six types from buildings to earthen houses according to their quality. Each type is further divided into twenty levels. Each level is further divided into housing and business use. The first-level building for business use is 22 jin of millet per room per quarter, while the first-level earthen house for residential use only costs 1.5 jin of millet per room per quarter. Earthen house residences below the third level only cost 1 jin of millet.

    The progressive rate of land tax is even more significant. First, it is divided into twenty levels according to location and value. The first-level land is taxed at 503 jin of millet per mu, while the twentieth-level land is taxed at only 15 jin of millet. Then, it is levied progressively based on the area occupied by the owner. The progressive method is based on the tax amount of one standard mu as the progressive starting point (the tax amount of one standard mu is the total tax amount of the city divided by the total number of mu in the city), and the excess part is subject to a fixed amount of millet levied by multiples, with the highest progressive point being 550 jin of millet per standard tax amount.

    The calculation of agricultural tax is more complicated. In principle, the tax exemption point is first established based on the living needs of the cultivator, so that the general poor peasants do not have to bear the burden. The cultivated land above the tax exemption point is the burden mu. The calculation of mu is based on the average annual output, with nine market dou of corn as one standard mu. Then, according to the amount of burden mu, it is divided into tax grades. There are thirteen grades of progressive tax. Below two burden mu, it is calculated at 0.8 points, and the maximum amount is for those with more than 24 burden mu, with each burden mu calculated at 2 points.

    In summary, those who are poor are exempt from tax, and the more income, the more tax paid. This is the progressive principle. This principle is the fairest. It is completely opposite to the situation under the previous reactionary rule, where the poorer one was, the more heavily exploited one was.

    III. Has the People's Burden Increased?

    The tax revenue in Beijing has increased in the second half of the year. Land tax and property tax already existed. Although they are old taxes being levied again, taxpayers may temporarily feel an increased burden. The unified levy of income tax and business tax on profit-making enterprises has increased the tax amount. Previously, income tax was 6 jin per point, and business tax was 2 jin per point, totaling 8 jin. Now, the unified levy is 12 jin per point, an increase of one-third. On the surface, it seems that each industrial and commercial household has to pay one-third more tax than in the past, but in reality, the burden has not increased proportionally. This is because the business conditions of general industrial and commercial households were not good in the past. Beijing's economy is gradually recovering, so if the same merchant bears one point of tax, paying 8 jin in the past, and now paying 4 jin more because business is better, the burden has not increased proportionally. The increase in industrial and commercial tax is basically due to the prosperity of business. Therefore, this increase is completely reasonable.

    We can ask again, is the current tax burden on Beijing citizens higher than before liberation? On the surface, it seems higher. The tax revenue in the first half of the year before liberation was about 42 million jin of millet. The municipal government's expenditure in the second half of this year will reach 95 million jin of millet. If we want to balance revenue and expenditure, tax revenue must be more than doubled compared to before liberation. However, under reactionary rule, there were various miscellaneous levies in addition to the regular taxes. The ratio of regular taxes to miscellaneous levies for various industries and businesses was 42 to 58, with miscellaneous levies being higher than regular taxes. Now that miscellaneous levies have been completely abolished, although regular taxes have more than doubled, the total burden on citizens has not changed much.

    For individual legitimate industrial and commercial operators, it is likely to be lighter than before liberation. Because under reactionary rule, there was no fixed standard for paying taxes. Those with power or those who bribed the tax authorities could set the tax amount very low, or could delay payment and wait for currency devaluation before settling. Those with power paid less, and legitimate merchants had to pay more; whoever benefited, others suffered. The unlucky ones were naturally small and weak industrial and commercial households. The situation of Beijing's tax revenue under reactionary rule in the autumn of 1948 is a clear example:

    　　　　　　　　　　　　Autumn　　　　　　　　　　　Winter
    Shengxifu (Hat Shop)　　　　60.23　　　　　　　　120.46
    Zhongyuan Company (Department Store)　　　　157.95　　　　　　　　316.00
    Hengdeli (Watch Shop)　　　　26.70　　　　　　　　53.40
    Qinghuachi (Bathhouse)　　　　65.70　　　　　　　　132.00
    Tongshenhe (Hat Shop)　　　　1　　　　　　　　108.72
    Hua'an Hotel　　　　　　　　1　　　　　　　　18.10
    Donglaishun (Restaurant)　　　　1　　　　　　　　302.00
    Dongshunxing (Noodle Shop)　　　　48.00　　　　　　　　200.00
    Yunsheng (Radio)　　　　120.00　　　　　　　　1,120.00
    Jiyou (Jade Shop)　　　　　　　　90.00　　　　　　　　1,200.00
    Datong (Gasoline)　　　　　24.00　　　　　　　　400.00
    Wulong (Ornaments)　　　　90.00　　　　　　　　500.00
    Masila (Barbershop)　　　　1　　　　　　　　500.00
    Huixiantang (Restaurant)　　　　1　　　　　　　　550.00

    There was no reason to say that the tax paid by Zhongyuan Department Store could be lower than that of Wulong Ornament Store. The most surprising thing is that Zhongyuan Company was even lower than Masila barbershop and Huixiantang restaurant. This kind of situation will never happen now. The business tax is promoted by the "Industrial and Commercial Tax Collection Promotion Committee," which is responsible for promoting self-determination of each industry in a democratic way. This committee includes representatives of industry and commerce and representatives of other people's organizations. Therefore, there is no possibility of tax evasion. As long as it is fairly distributed, legitimate industrial and commercial households will not be additionally exploited. So their existing burden, although the tax rate is set high, may actually be lower.

    IV. The Nature of Taxation Has Changed

    What we have discussed above is still on the people's burden of Beijing's tax revenue. Our conclusion is that the burden in the second half of the year is heavier than in the first half of the year, and not much different from before liberation. But there is a difference in the distribution of the burden. Now, those with more income bear a heavier burden, and those with less income bear a lighter burden, which is exactly the opposite of before liberation. Our discussion is still looking at the problem from a formal point of view. This is not enough, because the essence of taxation has changed after liberation. Taxation is the state asking the people for money. The nature of the state determines the nature of taxation. Under the reactionary regime, the state was a machine for the exploiting class to oppress the people, and taxation was a tool for exploitation, used to protect the interests of feudal landlords, bureaucratic capital, and imperialism. Now the people have turned over. The state is a machine to protect their own interests. The things that the people's government wants to do are all beneficial to the people. These things, such as opening roads, cleaning up sewers, building factories, and supporting the liberation war, cannot but cost money. When the people take out money, it is taxation. Therefore, in a country where the people are the masters, more taxes are not a bad thing, but on the contrary, it is a good thing, because this shows that the people's government is seriously doing things for the people.

    We can check the proportion of various expenditures of the Beijing Municipal Government before liberation: personnel expenses accounted for 90%, temporary expenses accounted for 2%, and business expenses accounted for 8%. This is the typical finance of reactionary rule. The people's money was used to support bureaucrats, that is, to support government personnel who suppressed the people. Less than 10% was used on the people.

    At the beginning of liberation, the main task of the military control period was to consolidate the revolutionary order. Therefore, in terms of financial expenditure, it should be biased towards the government's own regular expenses. Therefore, in February, regular expenses accounted for 99.42% of the total expenditure. This is inevitable. But the people's government must immediately embark on the direction of construction. Of course. By June, regular expenses had been reduced to 68.68%. Reducing the proportion of regular expenses and increasing the proportion of business expenses is the basic policy of the people's municipality. Vice Mayor Zhang announced in the report of the First Session of the People's Representatives of All Circles in Beiping: "The estimated expenditure in the second half of the year totals 95.07 million jin of millet, an increase of more than double compared with the first half of the year. Among them, regular expenses account for 47.75% of the total expenditure, professional expenses such as education, health, and construction account for 40.18%, and reserve expenses account for 12.07%." This is a concrete manifestation of realizing the people's municipality.

    At the Second Session of the People's Representatives, Mayor Nie announced again: "In this year's budget for the second half of the year, business expenses have accounted for 40.18% of the total expenditure, not including the business expenses used in the reserve fund. The budget for the next year, which is being compiled, plans to increase business expenses to slightly more than 50% of the total annual expenditure."

    The progress of Beijing's municipality can be marked by these figures as milestones.

    The more money spent on one's own welfare, the better. Mayor Nie has assured the people of Beijing: "We are adopting the policy of taking from the people and using it for the people, and we will never waste a penny." Under this guarantee, the citizens of Beijing will inevitably accept the new tax proposals with a happy spirit.

    V. Tax Policy for Developing Production

    We must also understand that the tax revenue of any country is not simply for financial revenue, but also to achieve its economic and political goals in a certain period in the tax work. The tax revenue under reactionary rule was used to oppress the people and to seek benefits for imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic bourgeoisie. Our people's government's tax policy is to achieve the goals of developing production, ensuring supply, promoting economic prosperity, and taking into account both public and private interests. Taxation is an important means to promote China from an agricultural country to an industrial country. The five proposals of the Beijing Municipal People's Government this time are based on this policy. It is to solve several important economic problems in Beijing.

    The first is the issue of promoting industrial construction. Therefore, the principle of protecting industry is stipulated in the proposals for income tax and business tax on profit-making enterprises: industry is lighter than commerce, manufacturing of production tools such as machinery is lighter than manufacturing of ordinary daily necessities, manufacturing of necessities is lighter than manufacturing of non-necessities, and manufacturing that can replace imported necessities and export commodities is given tax reduction treatment. Therefore, the income tax part of machinery manufacturing, etc., is reduced by 40%, and other levels of reduction rates are separately stipulated according to the above principles. In the business tax part, machinery industry, etc., is levied at 0.5%, while the money industry, etc., is levied at 4% of its income. In addition, it is stipulated that for industries and businesses that have special benefits for the national economy and people's livelihood, or are especially needed by Beijing, they can apply for an increase in the reduction rate. In terms of land tax, industrial construction is taken into account, and factories are encouraged to develop outside the city. Therefore, land for building houses outside the city is temporarily exempt from tax. In terms of property tax, it is also stipulated that newly built houses are exempt from tax for three years. These many regulations combined will encourage people's capital to be invested in industrial construction. Not only that, but in order to take care of the industrial construction of national capital, it is stipulated that all public and private enterprises pay taxes to the municipal government according to this unified tax rule. This can make private enterprises not feel unfair.

    Secondly, it is necessary to solve the problem of land use and citizen residence in Beijing's future development. Beijing was originally not a production city, so the entire physical environment is not suitable for production development. To this day, the population and factories are still crowded in the city. If this situation is allowed to develop, industry will develop, the population will inevitably increase, and the already crowded areas will inevitably become more crowded, affecting the lives of residents. Therefore, the government must disperse various undertakings and populations to the suburbs as soon as possible in many aspects, and build a new Beijing with demonstration effects in a planned way. This tax proposal also takes this issue into account. In the property tax, the first is to encourage house rentals, and the property tax on self-occupied houses is increased from the original 60% of the taxable amount of rented houses to 80%. That is, many homeowners who now have houses but are unwilling to rent them will be willing to rent out their houses to reduce their burden because the taxable amount of self-occupied houses is higher. The current housing situation in Beijing, although there is already a crowded phenomenon, is not an absolute housing shortage, but is due to uneven distribution. A few people occupy too many houses, and some are even locked up empty. The new property tax can make the distribution of residence more even. However, because the cumulative rate of housing area is not used, the effect may not be very large. In terms of land tax, as mentioned above, there are already regulations on tax exemption for building houses outside the city. This is a measure to encourage development in the suburbs. There is no doubt that the new Beijing cannot be limited by this ancient city wall. Coupled with the establishment of a transportation network in the suburbs, the prosperity of the suburbs will inevitably reduce the congestion in the city, so that the citizens of Beijing can enjoy a better physical environment.

    　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×

    The five fiscal and tax proposals passed by the Second Session of the People's Representatives of All Circles in Beijing will not only be accepted and supported by the people of Beijing, but will also enable Beijing to take a step towards building a people's capital. We believe that the two million people of Beijing have deeply recognized and understood the benefits of this tax policy from practical experience, and will guarantee its smooth completion one by one.

　　论北京的税收
    北京市第二届各界人民代表会议通过了北京市人民政府关于财政税收的五个提案。这五个提案已经把北京市财政税收提高到了一个新阶段：从解放后部分改革的过渡阶段，提高到了实现人民政协共同纲领的税收政策的阶段。这五个提案是新阶段的开始。
    一　以乡养城的恢复期
    解放之初，税收工作是采取逐步改进的方针，暂时沿用旧税制，把急切需要改革的税目和税率加以取消或调整。以北京来说，三十七种旧税目最初就减少到二十一种，后来又减少到十七种。不合理的苛捐杂税被废止了，因之在整理旧税过程中，人民的负担大为减轻。新解放区遭受了反动统治临终时的疯狂搜刮和战争的损伤，再加上初解放时，内外城乡系有了重大改变，工商各业必须有一个时期的喘息，休养，改组和整顿。在这个时期，税收减轻正可以发生安定秩序，恢复经济的作用。
    解放后，北京的税收是减轻了。这一点在北京市人民政府一九四九年上半年的赋税收入数字中表示得极清楚：二月份只有二十七万斤小米，以后每月逐渐增加，但是到六月份还只有五百八十万斤小米，一共是一千八百六十九万斤。和下半年九月份一千四百六十万斤小米相比较，就可以看得出上半年税收之轻了。再可以和解放前的情况比较：一九四八年二月份的市府收入折合小米是一千九百五十万斤，九月份是一千六百八十万斤。这样看来，解放后经过了半年的时间，正是北京市经济上休养和恢复的时期。
    北京市人民负担轻并不是说北京市政府的支出缩紧了。相反的，从支出方面来比较，解放后没有一个月份不超过前一年的。一九四八年二月到六月市府支出共二千五百五十九万斤小米，而一九四九年相当时间支出共四千二百七十五万斤小米。收入减少，支出增加，发生了差额。北京市解放后，从二月到六月市政府平均收入只占平均支出的百分之四十三点七。这个赤字是由华北政府津贴的，换一句话说，是由广大农民来津贴的，所以这是“以乡养城”的情况。这种情况只能在医治创伤的时期才说得过去，但决不应当长期这样下去的。所以赤字的数目应当跟着经济的恢复逐渐减低，那就是说，税收应当跟着经济恢复的速率而提高，一直做到“以城养城”的目标。再进一步，在经济上要实现以城市领导乡村，必须能以城市收入补助乡村建设，那是“以城养乡”。这是城市建设的最后目标。
    二　收入多的负担重
    北京市政府提出这五个税收提案，目的之一是在增加收入。聂市长在代表会议的报告的最后一段里说得很清楚：“为了实现上述市政建设，势须支付相当巨额的经费。因此，整理税收，实有必要，北京市民的负担不可能减轻。”北京市已进入建设阶段，所以下半年的市府支出必然要超过上半年。自二月至六月实支四千二百七十万斤小米而下半年的概算支出共计九千五百万斤小米。增加了一倍多。上半年的收入只有一千八百六十八万斤小米，所以如果下半年要做到收支相抵，以城养城，在收入方面必须增加四倍。如果依五个提案里所预计在下半年可以征收的数目加以估计可以有六千二百万斤小米，即便再加上其他税收，这可能有相当数目的赤字。北京市的建设还得有一部分靠农民的津贴。
    要尽量做到以城养城的目标，下半年北京人民已经要比上半年增加四倍的负担了。于是问题是怎样去加强税收呢？
    当我们一说到加税，心里就会不舒服，这是长期受反动统治的结果，过去在反动统治下税收是反动政府掠夺人民的工具，所以加税就成了加强掠夺。这是千真万确的。反动统治为了要保护自己的阶级利益，所以税收的对象必然是被压迫的人民。且不提那些苛捐和摊派，如像北京市民所熟悉的绥靖捐，守护捐，兵役费等；就是以正税来说，也总是从加强间接税下手的。间接税，如象货物税，是可以由商人转嫁到消费者身上去的。最明显的是粮食，油盐等生活必需品的货物税，这些货物税加重了，有钱人比例上负担轻，而穷人却比例上负担重。和间接税性质上不同的是直接税。直接税是以收入多少为根据的。如象房产税，有房产的人才要纳税，房产多的人税也纳得重，没有房产的就没有负担。在反动统治下，直接税是永远搞不好的，因为直接税和统治阶级利益不合。他们是有产阶级所以不会向自己人要钱的。在人民民主的政权之下，税收的重点必然要有不同，它应该是放在直接税上面的。
    北京市人民政府关于财政税收的五个提案实现了人民政协共同纲令的税收政策。这五个提案中所提出的税目是：营利事业所得税和营业税，房产税，地产税，农业税，以及随上述诸税附征的小学教育费及清洁卫生费。这些都是直接税。这是说今后北京市人民政府在行政上和在建设事业上所需的费用将要大部分由有营利事业的，有房产的，有地产的，有农业收入的市民来负担了，而且收入大的，负担重，收入少的，负担轻。
    为了要使收入多的人多负担市政经费，所以上述诸税都采用了分类和累进原则。营利事业所得税依所得多寡规定税率。纳税额不满一分者免税，使很多小本经营的事业得到了照顾。更从免征点起到一百五十万元共分二十级，每级税率累进百分之一。一百万元以下的级距为十万元，一百万元以上的级距缩短为五万元。一百五十万元以上为最高级，征所得税百分之二十五。房产税的原则也是这样的。一方面依好坏从楼房到土房分为六种。每种再分二十级。每级再依用途分住房与营业。一级的营业用的楼房每间每季是二十二斤小米，而一级的居住用的土房每间每季只要一斤半小米。到第三级以下的土房住宅只要一斤小米。
    地产税的累进率更为显著。先依地位和价值分为二十级。一级地每亩收五○三斤小米而二十级地只收一五斤小米。然后再依所有者占有面积累进征收。累进方法是以一标准亩之税额为累进起点（一标准亩之税额为以全市总税额除以全市总亩数），超过部分依倍数加征定额小米，最高累进点是每标准税额五百五十斤小米。
    农业税的计算比较复杂，原则上是先以耕者的生活需要确立免税点，使一般贫苦农民不必负担。免税点之上的耕地为负担亩。亩的计算是根据常年产量，九市斗玉米为一标准亩。再根据负担亩的多少按税等计分。累进税等共有十三级。两个负担亩以下按零点八分计，最高额是在二十四个负担亩以上的，每个负担亩按二分计。
    总结说来，凡是生活贫苦的可以免税，收入愈多，纳税也愈多。这是累进原则。这个原则是最公平不过的了。和以往反动统治下，愈究苦被剥削得愈重的情形，完全相反。
    三　人民负担是否增加？
    北京市下半年的税收是加重了。地产税，房产税原来就有的，虽系旧税重征，纳税人一时会有加重了负担的感觉。营利事业所得税和营业税统一征收提高了税额。上次所得税每分六斤，营业税每分二斤，合起来是八斤。现在统一征收每分十二斤，增加了三分之一。表面上看来是每家工商业户比了过去要多纳三分之一的税，实际上却不是比例上增加了负担。因为过去一般工商业户的营业状况是不好的。北京的经济逐渐在恢复中，所以同一商家如果分担一分税，过去纳八斤，现在营业好了，加纳四斤，比例上并没有增加负担，工商税的增加基本上是出于营业的繁荣。因此，这种增加完全是合理的。
    我们可以再问，现在的北京市民税收负担是不是比解放前为高呢？表面上看来是高了。解放前半年的税收约四千二百万斤小米。今年下半年市府支出要到九千五百万斤小米。如果要求收支相抵，税收比解放前要高过一倍。但是在反动统治下正税之外还有种种杂捐。各行业商户正税和杂捐的比例是四二比五八，杂捐高过正税。现在杂捐完全取消了，所以正税增加一倍多，市民的总负担却并没有多大变改。
    以个别的正当工商业者来说，很可能比解放前负担为轻。因为在反动统治下，纳税并没有一定标准的，那个有势力，或是和收税机关使一些袖手钱，税额就可定得很低，或是可以延迟付款，等通货贬值了再去清理。有势力的纳少了，没有势力的正当商人就得多纳些；谁便宜了，别人就吃亏。倒霉的自然是弱小工商家。一九四八年秋季反动统治下北京税收的情形是个很明白的例子：

    当时中原百货公司所纳的税可以低于五龙饰物店那是没有任何理由可以说的。最令人惊奇的是中原公司甚至低于马斯拉理发店和会仙堂饭庄。现在这种情形绝对不会发生的了。营业税是由“工商业税征收推进委员会”负责推动各行各业自行民主评定的。这个委员会包括工商业代表和其他人民团体的代表，因之，不可能有逃税的情形。只要公平分配，正当工商家就不会额外受到榨取了。所以他们现有的负担，虽则税率是定得高了，实际上却可能反而低落了。
    四　税收本质改变了
    我们在上面所讨论的还是就人民负担上论北京的税收。我们的结论是下半年的负担比起上半年是重了，比起解放之前则相差不远。但在负担的分配上却有了分别，现在是收入多的负担重，收入少的负担少，和解放前刚刚相反。我们这种讨论还是从形式上来看这个问题。这是不够的，因为解放后税收的本质改变了。税收是国家向人民要钱。国家的本质决定了税收的本质。在反动政权下，国家是剥削阶级压迫人民的机器，税收是剥削的工具，是用以保护封建地主，官僚资本和帝国主义的利益的。现在人民翻了身。国家是保护自己利益的机器了。人民政府要办的事，都是有利于人民的事。这些事象开马路，整理下水道，建设工厂，支援解放战争等等不能不花钱。人民拿钱出来，就是纳税。因之在人民做了主人的国家，税多并不是件坏事，相反的，是件好事，因为这样才表示人民政府在认真地为人民办事了。
    我们可以查一查解放前北平市政府支出各项的比例：人事经费占百分之九十，临时费占百分之二，事业费占百分之八。这是反动统治的典型财政。人民的钱是拿去养官僚的，也就是拿去养活镇压人民的政府人员的。用在人民身上的不到百分之十。
    解放之初，军管时期主要的工作是在巩固革命秩序，因之财政支出方面应当是偏重于政府本身的经常费，所以二月份经常费占了总支出的百分之九九．四二。这是必然的。但是人民的政府却须即日走上建设的方向。固然。到了六月份经常费就降低到了百分之六八．六八。降低经常费的比例和提高事业费的比例是人民市政的基本政策。张副市长在北平市第一届各界代表会议的报告里就宣布：“下半年的支出概算共计小米九千五百零七万斤。较前半年增加一倍以上。其中经常费占总支出的百分之四十七点七五，教育，卫生，建设等等专业费占百分之四十点一八，预备费占百分之十二点零七。”这是实现人民市政的具体表现。
    在第二屈代表会议上聂市长又宣布：“今年下半年的预算，事业费已占总支出的百分之四十点一八，预备费内所用于事业费的尚不计算在内。正在编制的明年度预算，事业费拟更增加到岁出总额的百分之五十稍强。”
    北京市政的进步就可以这些数字为里程牌。
    为自己福利所费的钱是愈多愈好。聂市长已向北京人民保证：“我们是采取着取之于人民，用之于人民的方针，决不浪费一文。”在这个保证之下，北京市民必然会以愉快的精神来接受新的税收提案。
    五　发展生产的税收政策
    我们更须明白：任何一个国家的税收，决不单纯只是为了财政收，而是同时要在税收工作中达到其一定时期的经济目的与政治目的。反动统治之下的税收是用来达到压迫人民的，为了帝国主义，封建势力和官僚资产阶级谋利益的。我们人民政府的税收政策是达到发展生产，保证供给，繁荣经济，公私兼顾的目的。税收是促成中国由农业国变成工业国的重要手段。这次北京市人民政府的五个提案就是根据这个政策而提出的。它是要解决北京市的几个重要的经济问题。
    首先是促进工业建设的问题。因之在营利事业所得税和营业税提案里规定了保护工业的原则：工业轻于商业，机器等生产工具制造业轻于普通生活资料制造业，必需品制造业轻于非必需品制造业，并对于能够代替舶来必需品和输出商品的制造业，予以减税待遇。因之所得税部分机器制造业等减征百分之四十，其他依上述原则分别规定了五级的减征率。在营业税部分机器工业等征收百分之零点五，而银钱业等征收其收益百分之四。此外再规定了对国计民生有特殊利益，或是北京所特别需要的工商业，这可以呈请提高其减轻率。在地产税方面照顾工业建设，并鼓励工厂在城外发展，所以对城外建屋用地，暂不征税。房产税方面又规定新建房屋免税三年。这许多规定综合起来，使人民的资本踊跃投向工业建设。不但如此，又为了要照顾民族资本的工业建设，所以规定了一切公营企业与私营企业均按这统一税则向市政府纳税。这样可以使私营企业不会感觉到不公平。
    其次要解决的是北京市今后发展中的土地利用和市民居住问题。北京原本不是个生产城市，因之整个体形环境并不适合于生产发展的。人口和工厂至今还是拥挤在城内，如果让这种情况发展下去，工业发达，人口必然会增加，已经拥挤的区域必然会更形拥挤、影响到居民的生活。因之，政府在很多方面必须及早把各种事业和人口疏散到郊区，有计划的建设一个有示范作用的新北京。这次税收的提案也照顾到了这个问题。在房产税中首先是鼓励房屋出租，把自住房屋之房产税从原来的占出租房屋纳税额的十分之六提高为十分之八。那就是使现在许多有房屋而不愿出租的房主，因为自住房屋的纳税额是高了而愿意把房屋出租以减轻其负担。现在北京房屋的情况，虽则已经有拥挤的现象，但是并不是绝对的房荒，而是由于分配不匀。少数人占用了太多的房屋，甚至还有空锁起来的。新的房产税可以使居住分配比较平匀一些。但是因为并没有运用房屋面积的累积率，所以在效果上可能不会很大。在地产税方面，如已在上文提到的，已有了城外建屋免税的规定。这是鼓励向四郊发展的措施。无疑的新北京决不可能被这古老的城墙所局限的。配合上四郊交通网的设立，四郊的繁荣必然可以减低城内的拥挤，使北京市民可以享受较好的体形环境。

    北京市第二届各界代表会议所通过的五项财政税收提案，不但将为北京人民所接受和拥护，而且将使北京市向建设人民首都的方向迈了一步。我们相信二百万北京人民都曾从实际经验中深刻的认识和了解这个税收政策的好处，逐一保证其顺利完成。
