　　West African Democratic Alliance Leaders on Hunger Strike in Prison
　　Ivory Coast People Actively Show Support
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 22nd] TASS reports, citing the Paris Humanité, that thirty-two leaders of the Ivory Coast region of the "African Democratic Rally," imprisoned by the French colonial authorities, began a hunger strike on December 12th. They have been held in prison for more than ten months without being interrogated or investigated. Among those detained are eight members of the "African Democratic Rally" leadership committee. Residents of the Ivory Coast are demanding the release of those detained. In the eleven regions of the "African Democratic Rally," the Ivory Coast region alone has 800,000 members (out of a total population of 2.3 million in the region). Humanité published an article by D'Arboussier on the 19th, pointing out: "Currently, seven hundred activists of the 'African Democratic Rally' are imprisoned. The African people are no longer willing to see their best sons filling the prisons."
    According to a report from Agence Telegraphique Congolaise, the French colonial authorities are carrying out brutal persecution of the African people, attempting to frustrate the African people's democratic movement. However, under the leadership of Houphouët-Boigny, chairman of the "African Democratic Rally," the people of the Ivory Coast have united around the "African Democratic Rally." To protest colonial oppression and support their leaders in prison, they have decided to systematically boycott all imported goods.

　　西非民主联盟被禁闭领袖在狱中绝食抗议
    象牙海岸人民积极声援
    【新华社北京二十二日电】塔斯社引巴黎人道报消息，被法国殖民地当局关在监狱里的三十二名“非洲民主联盟”象牙海岸区的领袖，自十二月十二日起开始绝食抗议。他们被关在监狱里已有十个月以上，既不加以审讯亦不着手调查。在在押者中，有八名“非洲民主联盟”领袖委员会的委员。象牙海岸的居民要求释放在押者。在“非洲民产联盟”的十一个区中，仅象牙海岸一区即拥有盟员八十万人（该区总人口为二百三十万人）。人道报于十九日刊登了达波赛的论文，他指出：“目前，有七百名‘非洲民主联盟’的活跃分子被禁锢狱中。非洲人民已不再愿看到他们最优秀的儿子充塞在监牢中。”
    另据电通社消息，法国殖民当局正在对非洲人民进行残酷迫害，想借以挫折非洲人民的民主运动，然而，在“非洲民主联盟”主席奥佛埃——鲍埃格尼的领导下，象牙海岸的人民已团结在“非洲民主联盟”的周围。他们为了抗议殖民地压迫和声援他们狱中的领袖，决定有系统地抵制一切入口货。
