Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 3rd (via TASS, Moscow): The newspaper "Izvestia" published an article on November 27th describing the agricultural production cooperatives in the People's Democratic countries, stating: The development of agricultural production cooperatives in the People's Democratic countries of Central and Southeastern Europe takes various forms. In Bulgaria, agricultural cultivation cooperatives are the most common. Farmers who participate in these cooperatives lease their land for public use. The majority of the cooperative's income (from 50 to 70 percent) is distributed to the members based on their labor, while a smaller portion (from 20 to 40 percent) is paid to the cooperative members as land rent. All farming activities of the cooperative are collectively cultivated according to the principle of remuneration based on work. Members of the collective farms calculate their work in work-day units, based on the quantity and quality of their work. Agricultural production cooperatives differ from Soviet collective farms mainly because the land cultivated by these cooperatives is the private property of its members.

In the People's Democratic countries, the number of agricultural cooperatives is increasing. By September of this year, Bulgaria already had 1,600 agricultural cultivation cooperatives, including 147,000 farm households, cultivating 5.4 million decares of arable land (Note: one decare equals ten ares, or 1.52 Chinese mu). The Polish people are also following the same path. By November of this year, Poland had 170 agricultural cooperatives. Romania had already formed 65 collective farms by October. Romanian farmers jointly share the land needed for collective cultivation, as well as livestock for cultivation, major farm implements, farm buildings, and all enterprises for processing agricultural products. However, residences and their surrounding land, small farm implements, and livestock remain private property. Like other People's Democratic countries, the collective farms in Romania also adopt the labor organization principles commonly used in Soviet collective farms. On collective farms, great attention is focused on the protection of public property.

Due to the benefits of large-scale collective farming and the widespread use of machinery and the most modern agricultural techniques, agricultural production cooperatives often achieve better harvests than individual farmers. Collective cultivation methods are increasingly convincing farmers of the need for organized cooperation.

### 集体耕种广泛利用机器　各人民民主国家农业合作社日增

　　集体耕种广泛利用机器
  　各人民民主国家农业合作社日增
    【新华社北京三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报十一月二七日载文叙述人民民主国家的农业生产合作社称：中欧与东南欧人民民主国家农业生产合作社的发展，具有各种不同的方式。在保加利亚，农业耕作合作社最为普遍。参加这种合作社的农民们把自己的一份土地出租作为公用，合作社收入的大部分（从百分之五十到百分之七十）是按劳动分配给社员，小部分（从百分之二十到百分之四十）则付给合作社社员作为他们的地租。合作社的一切农事，都依照按劳取酬的制度共同耕作，集体农场的成员们按工作的数量和质量来计算工作日单位。农业生产合作社不同于苏联集体农场，主要是因为这些合作社所耕种的土地，是它的社员们的私有财产。
    在人民民主国家，农业合作社的数目正在增加。今年九月保加利亚已经有了一千六百个农业耕作合作社，其中包括十四万七千农户，耕种可耕地五百四十万狄卡尔（按：一狄卡尔合十公亩，合一．五二市亩）。波兰人民也正在走上同样的道路。今年十一月，波兰已有了一百七十个农业合作社。罗马尼亚到十月就已经组成了六十五个集体农场。罗马尼亚农民共同享有集体耕作所需之土地和耕作用的牲口、主要农具、农场建筑物，以及对农产品加工的一切企业。但住宅及其附近的土地，小型农具和牲畜仍属私人财产。如同其他人民民主国家一样，罗马尼亚的集体农场上也采用苏联集体农场所通用的劳动组织原则。在集体农场上，巨大的注意力集中在公共财产的保护上。
    由于大规模集体耕种的好处，由于广泛利用机器和最现代化的农业技术，农业生产合作社常较个体农户得到更好的收获。集体耕作方法使越来越多的农民深信有组织合作的必要。
