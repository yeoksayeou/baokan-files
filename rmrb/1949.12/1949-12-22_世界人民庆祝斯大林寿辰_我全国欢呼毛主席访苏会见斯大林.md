The news that our Central People's Government Chairman Mao Zedong arrived in Moscow amidst the enthusiastic celebrations around the world for the 70th birthday of Stalin, the great leader of the world's people, was met with a grand welcome by the Soviet government, and he immediately met with Marshal Stalin. This is a major event for the people of China and the Soviet Union, and also a major event for the people of the whole world.

The facts of the past thirty-two years have proven that only socialist countries, socialist people, and socialist leaders truly aid the cause of the Chinese people's liberation. Without the Soviet Union, without Stalin, without their assistance, the Chinese revolution could not have achieved such a great victory as it has today. Therefore, the Chinese people harbor infinite gratitude and heartfelt love for the Soviet people and their great leader. At the same time, it is impossible for the Chinese people to consolidate their victory and continue to be victorious without more assistance from Stalin and the Soviet people. Our people must learn more from the Soviet Union's revolutionary and construction experiences and further develop the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Chairman Mao brought this true feeling and desire of the Chinese people to the Soviet people and Marshal Stalin. Therefore, when the news of Chairman Mao's arrival in Moscow spread, people all over the country were excited and encouraged, unanimously believing that this was another major event in the nation's political life following the founding ceremony, a symbol of the further consolidation of Sino-Soviet relations and the new development of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and would make a significant contribution to the cause of world peace and democracy. International public opinion also attaches great importance to this meeting.

In his speech upon arriving at the Moscow station, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The important tasks at present are to consolidate the world peace front headed by the Soviet Union, oppose the instigators of war, consolidate the relations between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people." The people of the whole country firmly believe that the meeting between the leaders of the Chinese and Soviet people will provide a full guarantee for the realization of these tasks.

The activities celebrating Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday are gradually reaching a climax. Progressive people all over the world regard celebrating Stalin as a particularly important matter. This is because celebrating Stalin means "supporting his cause, supporting the victory of socialism, and supporting the direction he has pointed out for mankind"; because celebrating Stalin means "celebrating the liberation of mankind, celebrating the hope and future of mankind."

The Soviet people are in a surging patriotic upsurge. Workers in enterprises in various industrial centers across the country—Central Ural Kharkov, Orel Oblast, Kiev, Donets Basin, Donbass, Stalinno, Gorky, and other places—are celebrating Stalin's birthday with Stakhanovite work methods and socialist competitions. Reports of completing production plans ahead of schedule and providing new production guarantees are flying to Moscow like snowflakes. Enterprises under the agricultural machinery industry have decided to complete the annual plan and overfulfill the production quota before the birthday. Agricultural machinery workers have pledged to Stalin to prepare the machines needed for spring field cultivation ahead of schedule. Collective farms across the country have completed the fourth quarter plan for repairing tractors, ensuring a solid foundation for next year's bumper harvest. Various clubs, cultural palaces, museums, and theaters are decorated with special concerts, evenings, exhibitions, and new entertainment programs. The birthday of the great Stalin is celebrated like the great October Revolution Day.

People's democratic countries have also launched mass birthday celebration movements. This is manifested in labor competitions in the production and enterprise sectors of various countries (such as the Stalin shift system in Czechoslovakia, the summary of birthday competition achievements in Bulgaria, and the labor competition of German miners), in congratulatory letters and large-scale signature campaigns from the people of various countries, in mass gift-giving movements in various countries, and also in mass activities of large-scale publication and reading of Stalin's biographies and his works. Through these mass movements, the working people of the people's democratic countries expressed their infinite love for Stalin.

People in capitalist countries, especially in Western European countries, are also celebrating his health for Stalin's great achievements and lofty ideals. The working class, revolutionary parties, and progressives in countries such as Britain, France, Italy, the United States, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, and Greece use exhibitions, birthday celebrations, lectures, gift-giving, signatures, special issues and commemorative albums, and various forms of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's works to expand the influence of Stalin's cause and doctrine.

In the new China, celebrating Stalin's birthday has a particularly profound significance. Stalin has always been the best friend of our people, always sympathizing with and assisting our people's revolutionary movement. Stalin's doctrine, Stalin's methods and theories, especially Stalin's analysis and judgment on the nature and strategy of the Chinese revolution, is the greatest help for the victory of the Chinese revolution. Today we celebrate Stalin, that is, celebrate the victory of our own revolution. Based on this understanding, the broad masses of people of all classes and nationalities across the country have universally launched birthday celebration activities under the slogan of supporting Stalin and learning from Stalin. Our Central People's Government Chairman Mao Zedong, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, various parties, and various people's organizations have sent congratulatory messages. Grand birthday celebrations were held in major cities across the country. People from all walks of life in the capital also launched a signature campaign to celebrate the birthday. Xinhua News Agency recently republished Chairman Mao's essays and speeches made ten years ago to celebrate Stalin's 60th birthday, which is particularly important at present. Chairman Mao's essays and speeches enable the Chinese people to further understand the reason for celebrating Stalin's 70th birthday.

　　　　Women's Movement Combined with Armed Struggle; Asian Women's Conference Achieves Consistent Conclusions

The Asian Women's Representative Conference, which was held in Beijing and had great significance, successfully closed on the 16th of this month. During the conference, progressive women representatives and guests from twenty-three countries exchanged and synthesized their specific experiences in carrying out struggles in different environments, and further determined the struggle paths of women in Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries to fight for national independence, their own rights, and children's rights. The results of the conference show that Asian women, who have been under the rule and oppression of imperialism and feudalism for a long time, have reached an unprecedented level of awakening and unity.

The conference listened to the report of Mrs. Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation, on "The Struggle of the International Democratic Women's Federation for National Independence and Peace," the report of Chinese representative Deng Yingchao on "Asian Women's Struggle for National Independence, People's Democracy, and World Peace," the report of Iranian representative Masin Faroki on "Protecting the Rights of Asian Women," and the report of Indian representative Amita Devi on "Protecting Children's Rights"; it heard the accusations of representatives from various countries about how American, British, French, and Dutch imperialists devastated and enslaved women and children in colonies and semi-colonies; it passed the "Letter to Asian Women Sisters" and the "Letter to American, British, French, and Dutch Women"; and it passed three resolutions on "On Striving for Women's Rights," "On the Situation of Children in Asian Countries," and "On the Activities of the International Democratic Women's Federation to Aid Women's Organizations in Asian Countries." All these reports, accusations, declarations, and resolutions illustrate one truth: the women's movement and women's liberation in colonial and semi-colonial countries cannot be separated from the entire national liberation movement and can succeed independently; Asian colonial and semi-colonial women can only obtain true freedom and liberation when they overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudal forces, and comprador bourgeoisie, and the people become the masters of their own destiny. At the same time, all these reports, accusations, declarations, and resolutions also point out a conclusion: the women's democratic movement in Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries must be combined with armed struggle and become a powerful coordination of armed struggle; they must unite with all the people, form a broad national people's democratic united front, and actively participate in the national liberation movement and armed struggle under the leadership of the working class and its political party, to fight for national independence and the establishment of people's democratic power.

Through this conference, the oppressed women of Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries have united with the Asian women who have already been liberated, united with the women of socialist and people's democratic countries, and also united with the progressive women in capitalist countries. This unprecedentedly broad and great unity, coupled with the strong assistance of the international peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, is a major guarantee for Asian women to overcome their common enemy—imperialism and its Asian agents. This conference, like the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference, has achieved great success.

The revolutionary struggle of the Asian people against the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs is continuing to develop.

　　　　Anti-Imperialist Struggles Continue to Increase in South Korea, Indonesia, Malaya and Other Places

According to recently published battle results, the South Korean People's Guerrilla Army launched 5,508 battles in the seven months from April to October, and there are more and more peasant uprisings. The Indonesian people have further recognized the face of the Sukarno-Hatta reactionary clique, and are now uniting around the Indonesian Communist Party to resist the implementation of the "Hague Agreement" and persist in and develop armed struggle. The Malayan guerrillas, who have persevered for more than a year in a difficult environment, have established even broader and closer unity and cooperation with the various ethnic groups of Malaya since being reorganized into the Malayan National Liberation Army in February this year. Ten detachments have now been established, and the number of attacks on British military police is increasing. The British colonial government's "military offensive" and "political offensive" have both failed. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which controls 90 percent of Vietnamese territory, successfully commemorated the third anniversary of "December 19" (the day the French imperialists launched a full-scale offensive), while on the side of the French aggressors, morale was low and desertions increased. The movement of the French people demanding an end to the war of aggression is expanding. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people are confidently preparing to achieve even greater victories in the coming 1950.

The strength of the international peace camp headed by the Soviet Union and the victory of the Chinese people's revolution are encouraging the Asian people to advance the revolutionary struggle.

### 世界人民庆祝斯大林寿辰　我全国欢呼毛主席访苏会见斯大林

　　世界人民庆祝斯大林寿辰
    我全国欢呼毛主席访苏会见斯大林
    在全世界各地热烈庆祝世界人民的伟大领袖斯大林七十寿辰声中，我中央人民政府毛泽东主席抵达莫斯科，受到苏联政府的隆重欢迎，并即会见了斯大林大元帅。这是中苏两国人民的一件大事，也是全世界人民的一件大事。
    三十二年来的事实证明，只有社会主义的国家、社会主义的人民和社会主义的领袖，真正援助中国人民的解放事业。如果没有苏联，没有斯大林，没有他们的援助，中国革命不可能取得象今天这样伟大的胜利。所以中国人民对苏联人民及其伟大领袖，怀着无限的感激和衷心的热爱。同时，中国人民要巩固胜利，并且要继续胜利，没有斯大林和苏联人民的更多的援助，是不可能的。我国人民必须更多地学习苏联的革命经验和建设经验，必须更进一步发展中苏两国人民的友谊。毛主席把中国人民的这种真情和愿望，带给了苏联人民和斯大林大元帅。因此当毛主席抵达莫斯科的消息传出以后，全国各地人民都为之兴奋鼓舞，一致认为这是全国政治生活中继开国盛典后的又一件大事，是中苏两国邦交更加巩固和中苏两国人民友谊将获新发展的象征，对于世界和平民主事业将有重大贡献。国际舆论对这次会见也极为重视。
    毛主席在抵达莫斯科车站时发表的演说中指出：“目前的重要任务，是巩固以苏联为首的世界和平阵线，反对战争挑拨者，巩固中苏两大国家的邦交和发展中苏人民的友谊。”全国人民坚决相信：中苏两国人民领袖的会见，将使这些任务获得充分实现的保证。
    庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰的活动，正逐渐趋向高潮。全世界进步人类把庆祝斯大林这一件事情，看作特别重大的事情。这是因为庆祝斯大林，就是“拥护他的事业，拥护社会主义的胜利，拥护他给人类指示的方向”；因为庆祝斯大林，就是“庆祝人类的解放，庆祝人类的希望和将来”。
    苏联人民处在汹涌澎湃的爱国热潮中。全国各工业中心——中部乌拉尔哈尔科夫、奥勒尔州、基辅、顿尼兹盆地、顿巴斯、斯大林诺、高尔基等地的企业工人，纷纷以斯塔哈诺夫工作方式和社会主义竞赛，来庆祝斯大林的生日。提前完成生产计划并提供新的生产保证的报告，雪片似地飞到莫斯科。农业机器工业所属各企业，决定在寿辰以前完成全年计划和超计划的生产定额。农业机械工作者向斯大林保证先期准备好春季农田耕作所需要的机器。全国各集体农场完成了修理拖拉机第四季计划，保证为明年的丰收打下稳固的基础。各俱乐部、文化宫、博物馆和戏院，布置着特别的音乐会、晚会、展览会和新的娱乐节目。伟大斯大林的寿辰，象伟大十月革命节一样受到庆祝。
    各人民民主国家也展开了群众性的祝寿运动。这表现在各国生产企业部门的劳动竞赛上（如捷克的斯大林轮班制，保加利亚的祝寿竞赛成绩总结，德国矿工的劳动竞赛等），表现在各国人民的祝贺信件和大规模的签名运动上，表现在各国群众性的献礼运动上，也表现在大规模出版和阅读斯大林传记及其著作的群众性活动上。人民民主国家的劳动人民通过这些群众性运动，表示了对斯大林的无限爱戴。
    资本主义国家特别是西欧各国的人民，也为斯大林的丰功伟绩及其崇高理想而庆祝他的健康。英、法、意、美、荷、挪威、瑞士、奥地利、希腊这些国家的工人阶级、革命政党和进步人士，通过展览会、祝寿会、演讲会、送礼、签名、发行特刊与纪念册以及马恩列斯著作的各种方式，来扩大宣传斯大林的事业和学说的影响。
    在新中国，庆祝斯大林的生日有着特别深刻的意义。斯大林一直是我国人民最好的朋友，一直同情和援助我国人民革命运动。斯大林的学说，斯大林的方法和理论，尤其是斯大林关于中国革命性质问题和策略问题所作的分析和论断，对于中国革命的胜利是一个最伟大的帮助。今天我们庆祝斯大林，也就是庆祝自己革命的胜利。基于这种认识，全国各阶级各民族的广大人民，在拥护斯大林、学习斯大林的口号之下，普遍展开祝寿活动。我中央人民政府毛泽东主席、中国共产党中央委员会、政务院周恩来总理、各党派和各人民团体，纷纷致电祝贺。全国各大城市都举行盛大的祝寿会。首都各界人民还发起了签名祝寿运动。新华社最近重新发表毛主席于十年前为庆祝斯大林六十寿辰所作的论文和讲话，这在目前特别重要。毛主席的论文和讲话使中国人民更进一步了解庆祝斯大林七十寿辰的道理。
    　　　　妇女运动结合武装斗争　亚洲妇代会获一致结论
    在北京召开的具有重大意义的亚洲妇女代表会议，已于本月十六日胜利闭幕。在这次会议的进行期间，二十三个国家的进步妇女代表和来宾，交流了和综合了她们在不同环境中进行斗争的具体经验，并进一步确定了亚洲殖民地和半殖民地国家妇女为争取民族独立、争取自身权利和儿童权利的斗争途径。会议的结果显示：长期在帝国主义和封建主义统治压迫下的亚洲妇女，已达到了空前觉悟和团结的程度。
    这次会议听取了国际民主妇联总书记瓦扬·古久里夫人关于“国际民主妇联为民族独立与和平的斗争”的报告，中国代表邓颖超关于“亚洲妇女为民族独立、人民民主、和世界合平而斗争”的报告，伊朗代表玛辛·法洛琪关于“保护亚洲妇女权利”的报告；和印度代表阿米塔·台维关于“保护儿童权利”的报告；听取了各国代表对于美、英、法、荷帝国主义者怎样摧残和奴役殖民地半殖民地妇女和儿童的控诉；通过了“致亚洲各国妇女姊妹书”和“告美、英、法、荷妇女书”的两项宣言；通过了“关于争取妇女权利”、“关于亚洲各国儿童情况”和“关于国际民主妇联援助亚洲各国妇女团体之活动”的三项决议。所有这些报告、控诉、宣言和决议，说明一个真理：殖民地半殖民地国家内的妇女运动和妇女解放，决不能离开整个民族解放运动而可以单独成功；亚洲殖民地半殖民地各国妇女，只有在推翻帝国主义、封建势力和买办资产阶级的反动统治，而人民成为自己命运的主人时，才能获得真正的自由和解放。同时，所有这些报告、控诉、宣言和决议，也指出一个结论：亚洲殖民地半殖民地各国的妇女民主运动，必须与武装斗争结合起来，并成为武装斗争的有力配合；她们必须与全体人民加紧团结起来，组成广泛的全民族的人民民主统一战线，在工人阶级及其政党的领导之下，积极参加民族解放运动和武装斗争，以争取民族独立和人民民主政权的建立。
    经过这次会议，亚洲殖民地半殖民地各国的被压迫妇女，和已经获得解放了的亚洲妇女团结起来了，和社会主义、人民民主国家的妇女团结起来了，也和资本主义国家内的进步妇女团结起来了。这种空前广泛的伟大的团结，加上以苏联为首的国际和平阵营的有力援助，是亚洲妇女能够战胜她们的共同敌人——帝国主义及其亚洲代理人的重大保证。这次会议如同亚澳工会代表会议一样，是获得了伟大的成就的。
    亚洲人民为反对帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治而进行的革命斗争，在继续发展中。
    　　　　南朝鲜印尼马来亚等地反帝国主义斗争继续增强
    据最近公布的战果，南朝鲜人民游击队在四月至十月的七个月中，曾展开五千五百零八次的战斗，农民起义的事情，愈来愈多。印度尼西亚人民已进一步认清了苏加诺——哈达反动集团的面目，现在正为反对“海牙协议”的实施而团结在印尼共产党的周围，坚持和发展武装斗争。在艰苦的环境中支持了一年余的马来亚游击队，自今年二月间改编为马来亚民族解放军后，与马来亚各族人民的团结合作更加广泛和亲密，现已成立了十个支队，袭击英军警的次数日益频繁。英国殖民地政府的“军事攻势”和“政治攻势”都告失败。控制着越南土地百分之九十的越南共和国政府，胜利地纪念了“一二、一九”（法帝国主义发动全面进犯的日子）的三周年，而在法国侵略者的一方面，则士气低落，逃亡日多，法国人民要求停止侵略战争的运动，日益扩大。越南人民在胡志明主席的领导之下，有信心地准备在即将到来的一九五○年取得更加伟大的胜利。
    以苏联为首的国际和平阵营力量的强大，中国人民革命的胜利，鼓舞着亚洲人民把革命斗争推向前进。
