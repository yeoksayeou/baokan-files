　　Decision on the Issuance of the People's Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds
    (Passed at the Fourth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2, 1949)
    1.  In order to support the People's Liberation War, rapidly unify the country, facilitate the stability of people's livelihoods, and embark on the path of economic recovery and development, it is decided to issue the People's Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds in 1950.
    2.  The raising, repayment of principal, and payment of interest on these public bonds will all be calculated based on a standard of physical goods. The unit is designated as "Fen." Each "Fen" is calculated based on the total average wholesale price of six catties of rice (millet in Tianjin), one and a half catties of flour, four chi of white cloth, and sixteen catties of coal in the six major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. The average market price will be uniformly announced by the People's Bank of China every ten days.
    3.  The total amount of these public bonds is 200 million "Fen," to be issued in installments throughout 1950. The first installment will be issued on a regular basis between January and March 1950. The time for continued issuance will be decided by the Government Administration Council.
    4.  These public bonds will be repaid over five years. 10% of the total amount will be repaid in the first year, with an increase of 5% each year thereafter. Principal will be repaid by lottery each year, starting one year after the issuance deadline.
    5.  The annual interest rate for these public bonds is set at five percent, also calculated based on physical goods. Interest will be paid once a year, starting one year after the issuance deadline.
    6.  The Government Administration Council is responsible for formulating the Regulations on the People's Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds based on this decision and promulgating them for implementation.
