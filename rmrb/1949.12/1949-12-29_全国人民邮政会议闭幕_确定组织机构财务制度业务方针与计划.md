    [Our Newspaper] The first National People's Postal Conference, hosted by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government, opened on the 10th of this month and concluded victoriously on the 28th after 18 days. During the conference, each unit reported on their work, exchanged experiences, and carefully studied and discussed the proposals. Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, Vice Chairman Bo Yibo of the Financial and Economic Committee, and Director Song of the Enterprise Bureau gave clear instructions, which will greatly promote the People's Postal Service in coordinating with the New Democratic political, economic, and cultural construction and completing the tasks of supporting the war and restoring production in the future.
    In his concluding report, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Zhu Xuefan pointed out the results of the main topics of this conference: (1) Postal organization structure: It was determined to establish a National Postal Administration under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to uniformly lead the national postal service. Major administrative regions will set up postal general sub-bureaus to represent the Postal Administration and be responsible for guidance and inspection of postal services in their respective regions. Postal administrations will be established in each postal district, and first, second, third, and fourth class post offices will be set up in various places. Local postal savings and remittance bureaus may continue to exist as needed for business and are subject to the leadership of the local postal administration. It was determined that military postal service is a permanent organization and part of the military establishment, under the unified leadership of the Military Commission. In terms of business, it is under the guidance of the Postal Administration, and local post offices should provide as much assistance as possible to facilitate communication for combatants. (2) Postal construction plan for 1950: It should cooperate with the development of transportation, rapidly restore postal offices and postal routes. The main postal routes should strive to reach the 1936 level, that is, restore to 53,995 kilometers. The existing rural postal routes are 69,015 kilometers, and efforts should be made to develop them further on the existing basis. (3) Financial system: It was determined that the national postal income and expenditure should be uniformly allocated and controlled by the Postal Administration, and a budget and final accounts system and financial reporting system should be established to bring postal financial administration into order. (4) In the 1950 postal budget, except for the Northeast, which may have a surplus, and North China, where revenue and expenditure are close to balanced, all regions have deficits. Efforts should be made to reduce the deficit and reduce the state treasury subsidy. (5) Postage: According to the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee, the postage for ordinary letters should be adjusted appropriately based on the standard of twelve liang of millet per twenty centimeters. (6) Business policy: It was determined that the postal parcel business should focus on receiving and sending individual miscellaneous parcels; under the principle of mutual assistance and cooperation with other transportation departments, commodity parcels should be received and sent to promote the normal exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. It was determined that postal savings and remittances must accept the guidance of the People's Bank in terms of policy. It was determined that newspaper distribution is one of the main businesses of the post office, and a foundation should be laid in 1950 to meet the new upsurge of economic and cultural construction. (7) Develop rural postal services with focus and planning. (8) 1950 production plan: Letters should increase by 44 percent compared to 1949, parcels increase by 38 percent, and remittances increase by 413 percent. (9) Revise the titles of postal personnel to completely eliminate the remnants of feudalism and imperialism, in order to strengthen unity; establish a labor insurance system as soon as possible to protect the lives of employees.
    Minister Zhu also requested that each postal district formulate its own budget and production plan, implement them effectively, conduct regular inspections, improve work efficiency, and make postal letters, remittances, and other businesses rapid, secure, simple, and inexpensive, and expand the scope of postal business; strengthen the relationship between the trade union and administration, streamline and save, and strive to complete the 1950 production plan.
    Finally, Zhao Zhigang, Deputy Director of the Postal Administration, delivered the opening speech. He pointed out that the focus in 1950 should be on restoration and reorganization, and clarified that postal operations should be enterprise-oriented, management should be democratic, and the development policy should focus on postal monopoly businesses, especially emphasizing that newspaper distribution business should be completed as a political task; and pay attention to strengthening unity, calling on everyone to be honest and dedicated.
    Everyone adjourned at 5:30 in the afternoon.
