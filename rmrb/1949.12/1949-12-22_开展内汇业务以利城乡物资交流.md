Developing Domestic Remittance Business to Benefit Urban-Rural Material Exchange
Lu Dun'gen

Editor's Note: Shanghai is the center of national remittance and the concentration point of national currency. We are publishing an article by Comrade Lu Dun'gen, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch, on the situation and experience of the Shanghai Branch in developing remittance business. This article raises issues in developing remittance, and has good experience in mastering exchange rates, managing remittance, and improving internal remittance processing procedures. We hope that banking colleagues in various regions will pay attention to studying it.

Expanding domestic remittance business is not only because it is a type of bank business, but also a political task aimed at helping the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and smashing the enemy's blockade, in light of the expanding liberated areas. Under the enemy's blockade of our import and export trade, domestic remittance business is of more important significance than foreign business for building an independent and self-reliant New Shanghai. The Shanghai Branch started remittance business with Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Jinan, and Xi'an on June 22. The general situation of the remittance business in the past three months is introduced below:

	I. Overview of Domestic Remittance Business in June, July, and August

After completing the training of cipher personnel and the preparatory work such as contacting affiliated banks for remittance and exchanging impression specimens, the Shanghai Branch started domestic remittance business on June 21. At that time, except for the Northeast region where remittance was temporarily unavailable due to currency relations, the initial remittance locations numbered 27. Subsequently, they were added successively. By the end of August, the remittance network had spread to major cities across the country, with 138 remittance locations. The cumulative amount of remittances received for the three months was 20,880,540,000 yuan; the cumulative amount of remittances sent was 14,028,840,000 yuan. Compared with Shanghai's private banks and financial institutions, the Shanghai Branch accounted for 25.09% of the city's total remittances received in July (comparisons for June were unavailable due to incomplete statistics from private institutions), and 40.76% in August. For remittances sent, the Shanghai Branch accounted for 49.50% of the city's total in July, and 59.84% in August. This shows that the Shanghai Branch is gradually progressing in the remittance business and gaining an advantage.

According to the analysis of the content of remittances received by our bank in July and August, loans ranked first, accounting for 21% of the total remittances received; followed by institutional funds, accounting for 16%; remittances from the banking industry ranked third, accounting for 12%; and state-owned enterprises accounted for 5.8%. In terms of the content of remittances sent in July and August, state-owned trading enterprises ranked first, accounting for 37% of the total remittances sent; followed by state-owned production enterprises, accounting for 19%; remittances from institutions, industry and commerce, and banking institutions ranked third, totaling 20.86%.

	II. Problems Encountered in Developing Domestic Remittance

As the remittance business gradually develops, the Shanghai Branch has encountered the following problems:

(1) Mastering exchange rates. In the early stages of handling remittance, we had no experience in determining exchange rates, and transportation costs could not be estimated due to abnormal traffic conditions. Therefore, we decided to adhere to the principle of being close to the natural exchange rate, which was about 80% of the exchange rate of private banks and financial institutions at the time. Later, we learned that the exchange rates of private institutions fluctuate mostly based on their own liquidity. If we blindly followed their fluctuations, we would be completely passive and it would be inconsistent with the policy of helping urban-rural material exchange and developing production. Therefore, we decided to adopt a strategy of low prices and high volume, in order to reduce the costs of industrial and commercial fund transfers, lower freight costs, and facilitate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Therefore, from July, we generally lowered exchange rates, with the natural exchange rate only as a reference, thus taking the initiative in mastering exchange rates.

(2) Slow fund transfer from affiliated banks. In mid-July, there was a phenomenon of delayed fund transfers from affiliated banks, which caused dissatisfaction among many customers. In order to better serve the people, we conducted an inspection of delayed fund transfers in July and found the following reasons: ① Letters related to remittances did not indicate "Remittance Section Received" on the envelope, so the letters traveled within the branch, and the Remittance Section received them late. ② The dispatch and receipt group's mail delivery was not coordinated with the postal schedule, and the day's mail could not be sent out on the evening postal route, delaying it for one day. ③ Telegrams were sent slowly. The radio station's telegram transmission adopted a unified numbering system for various departments, and transmission was done according to the number, which could not meet the needs of the business for priority transmission, resulting in backlog. ④ The passwords of the affiliated banks were not uniform, and the cipher personnel were not skilled enough, which delayed the time. ⑤ Sundays or other holidays intervened, and letters of authorization were also delayed. ⑥ Postal routes were delayed, such as in Tunxi in July, where floods caused mail to take a month to arrive. ⑦ Affiliated banks could not deliver remittance notices to the payee due to their own liquidity or holidays. ⑧ Affiliated bank personnel handling remittance were not skilled enough and lacked a strong sense of business, only striving for outgoing remittances and not actively paying incoming remittances. ⑨ Remittance items through the office had to be concentrated at the branch, with cumbersome procedures, delaying the time. ⑩ No one was assigned to pay constant attention to the payment of remittances. Based on the above ten principles, in addition to striving for improvement ourselves, all matters beyond the scope of the branch, such as unified allocation of funds, expansion of remittance limits, unified remittance regulations, and ciphers, need to be researched and improved by the head office, district offices, issuing departments, and other affiliated banks.

(3) Remittance Limits. When we first started remittance business, we stipulated a limit of 100,000 yuan per remittance because the affiliated banks had not set limits. Due to this restriction, remitters inevitably had situations of remitting more by using multiple names. Therefore, we stipulated regulations for large-amount remittances. If they were indeed in compliance with the regulations, there was no limit on the amount per remittance. We generally do not handle interbank fund transfers to avoid arbitrage. However, we offer a 40% discount for the transfer of funds by business banks.

(4) Remittance Target. Initially, our remitters were mainly ordinary citizens sending money home due to limit considerations, and there were not many industrial and commercial remittances. Later, as the limits were relaxed, it became more common. In order to give preferential treatment to state-owned enterprises, develop production, and take care of employees, we also formulated the following preferential remittance measures: (1) State-owned enterprises that provide a letter stating the purpose of the remittance will receive a 40% discount on the exchange rate. (2) For the purchase and transportation of essential materials in this city, a 30% discount on the exchange rate will be given if the competent authority agrees with the bank on the amount of the remittance in advance. (3) State-owned enterprises and institutions entrusted to collect payments from other places will be charged a handling fee at a 30% discount. (4) Private enterprises and institutions entrusted to collect payments from other places will be charged a handling fee at an 80% discount. (5) Employees sending home remittances of less than 100,000 yuan, certified by the labor union, will receive an 80% discount on the exchange rate, but only once a month when salaries are paid and remitted as a whole.

(5) Remittance Purpose. In order to understand the nature of capital flows, we ask remitters or recipients of large outgoing and incoming remittances to indicate the purpose of the remittance, except for small remittances. We also ask private banks and financial institutions in Shanghai to fill out an analysis form on the purpose of remittances, in order to understand the situation and facilitate the management of the financial market.

(6) Settlement Issues. In the past three months, the remittances of the Shanghai Branch, except for June when outgoing remittances were 63% of incoming remittances, incoming remittances have consistently been greater than outgoing remittances in July and August. Outgoing remittances in July were 74% of incoming remittances, and outgoing remittances in August were 64% of incoming remittances. Therefore, as of the end of August, the total amount owed by affiliated banks to the Shanghai Branch reached 68,589,600,000 yuan. As of September 12, it had reached 108 billion yuan. The settlement and allocation of these debts urgently needs to be resolved by the head office or district office.

	III. How to Improve Domestic Remittance Business

To actively develop domestic remittance business, based on the experience of the past three months, the following points are provided for reference for improvement:

(1) We must strengthen our business sense and establish the credit of the People's Bank's remittance business. Affiliated banks should fully demonstrate the spirit of cooperation based on the principle of subordinating partial interests to overall interests. We should strive for outgoing remittances with all our strength, and we should pay the same attention to the payment of incoming remittances and strive for speed. Because taking care of the interests of the payee is also improving the credit of the People's Bank's remittance.

(2) Remittance limits should be gradually increased, and finally reach no limit, so the remittance amount will inevitably increase. In order to implement a centralized clearing system, issuance treasuries should be established in major cities to uniformly allocate funds. Using buy-remittance methods for clearing is not sufficient to meet the needs of large-scale fund allocation, and clearing by this method causes fluctuations in exchange rates to stimulate prices.

(3) Because remittance represents the reverse direction of material transportation between the two places, we must strengthen the investigation and research of agricultural, industrial, and commercial conditions in various places, and fully understand the relationship between materials and capital flows in various places. For example, Ping Shui, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, and Sui'an in Zhejiang Province produce tea. Every time new tea is on the market, merchants from all over go to purchase it, so the incoming remittances in the above-mentioned places will inevitably increase. We must arrange and plan the position in advance. Affiliated banks in various places should exchange information on material exchanges and maintain contact.

(4) Master the exchange rate flexibly and proactively based on local prices and the supply and demand of positions, and do not completely track the exchange rates of private banks and financial institutions. And adhere to the principle of low prices and high volume.

(5) In terms of remittance practice, we must uniformly stipulate business processing procedures, unify remittance regulations and remittance codes, train cipher personnel to achieve rapid and accurate standards, formulate pre-printed inquiry letters, establish a remittance inquiry system, collect data and compile relevant statistical reports. The accounting systems of the affiliated banks must also be consistent.

　　开展内汇业务以利城乡物资交流
    卢钝根
    编者按：上海是全国汇兑的重心，又是全国货币的集中点，现将上海分行副理卢钝根同志所写关于上海分行开展汇兑的情况和经验一文发表，这篇文章提出了开展汇兑中的问题，并对掌握汇率，管理汇兑及改善汇款内部处理手续上均有好的经验，希望各地银行工作同志注意加以研究。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    展开内汇业务，不单因为他是银行的一种业务，而是针对解放区的日益扩大，帮助城乡物资交流，粉碎敌人封锁的一种政治任务，在敌人对我进出口贸易封锁的情况下，为着建设独立自主的新上海，内汇业务较外江业务更有其重要的意义。上海分行于六月二十二日与京、津、汉、济、西安等地开始通汇，兹将三月来汇兑业务概况，介绍于后：
    　　　　一、六、七、八月来内汇业务概况
    上海分行在完成了密押人员的训练及与联行接洽通汇互寄印鉴等筹备工作以后，于六月二十一日起即开始举办内汇业务，当时除东北区因货币关系暂未通汇外，初次通汇地点计二十七处，随后陆续加，截至八月底止，汇兑网已普及于全国各大都市，通汇地点达一三八处，汇入汇款三年月累计金额为二○八，八○五四万元；汇出汇款三年月累计为一四○，二八八四万元。与上海市私营行庄比较，则汇入汇款方面六月份因私营行市未及统计无法比较，七月份本行占全市总额百分之二五．○九，八月份占百分之四○．七六。汇出汇款七月份本行占全市总额百分之四九．五○，八月份占百分之五九．八四。显示了上海分行在汇兑业务上逐渐进展，取得优势。
    本行汇入汇款的内容据七、八两个月的分析，以贷款为首，占汇入总额百分之二十一；其次为机关经费，汇款占百分之十六；银钱业汇款居第三位，占百分之十二；公营企业占百分之五．八。七、八两个月汇出汇款之内容以公营贸易事业为首，占汇出总额百分之三十七；其次为公营生产事业占百分之十九，机关、工商业、银钱业汇款同列第三位，合计占百分之二○．八六。
    　　　　二、在开展内汇中所遇到的问题
    在汇兑业务日渐开展之际，上海分行所遭遇到的问题有下列数个：
    （一）汇水的掌握。在办理汇兑的初期，我们对于汇水的决定没有经验，运输费因交通不正常也无法估计，故决定以接近自然汇率为原则，当时的约为私营行庄汇率的百分之八十。后来由于了解行庄的汇率多以其本身头寸的松紧为伸缩，汇水较高，我们如果跟随其盲目波动，则完全被动，且于帮助城乡物资交流发展生产方针不合，因此我们遂将采取廉价多汇，借以减低工商业调拨款项的费用，使货运成本降低，有利于城乡物资的交流。故从七月份起我们将汇水普遍降低，自然汇率仅作为参考，这样在汇水掌握方面争取主动。
    （二）联行解款迟缓。在七月中曾发生联行迟解的现象，引起不少顾客的不满，我们为了更好的为人民服务，曾于七月间进行了一次汇款迟解的检查，发现迟解原因如下：①有关汇款的信件未在封面注明汇款科收字样，以致信件在分行内部旅行，汇款科收到已迟。②收发组函件发出与邮班不衔接，当日邮件未能于当晚邮班寄出，延迟一天。③电报拍发迟缓，电台拍发电讯采用各部处统一编号，依号拍发，不能适应业务之需要予以优先拍发，致有积压。④各联行密码不统一，办理密押人员技术不熟练，以致耽搁时间。⑤星期日或其他假日间隔，委托书亦随之延迟送出。⑥邮路迟滞，如屯溪七月内因大水为患，邮件需时一个月始能到达。⑦联行因本身头寸或假期关系，不能将汇款通知书送达收款人。⑧联行办理汇兑人员技术不熟练，业务观念不强，仅争取汇出汇款，解付汇入汇款不积极。⑨办事处所经汇款项，须集中分行，手续繁琐，耽搁时间。⑩未指派专人经常注意汇款之解付。根据以上十个原则，除我们本身力求改进外，所有非分行范围所及之处，如统一调拨资金，扩大通汇限额，统一汇兑章则，密押，尚须由总行区行发行分处及其他联行研究改进之。
    （三）汇款限额。在开始举办汇兑的时候，我们因联行限额未定，所以对于每笔汇款规定以十万元为限，由于此项限制，汇款人难免有借名多汇的情事，乃经规定大额汇款办法，如确系合于规定，每笔限额不加限制。我们对于同业调款一般不予承做，以免套汇，对于事业银行调拨头寸则予以六折优待。
    （四）汇款对象。我们的汇款人起初因限额关系，以一般市民赡家汇款为主，工商业汇款不多，后以限额放宽，乃见普及，并为优待公营企业及发展生产照顾职工，又订定了汇水优待办法如下：（１）公营企业汇款备函说明汇款用途者，汇率六折优待。（２）本市必需物资的购运，事先由主管机关与本行商定汇款数额者，汇水七折优待。（３）公营企业机关委托向外埠代收款项，手续费按七折收取。（４）私营企业机关委托向外埠代收款项手续费按八折收取。（５）职工十万元以下赡家汇款经职工会证明者，其汇率按八折优待，惟每月以发薪时一次并全体汇出者为限。
    （五）汇款用途。为了了解资金来往的性质，除小额汇款外，我们对于巨额汇出汇入款项均请汇款人或汇款收款人注明汇款用途，并请上海市各私营行庄填送汇款用途分析表，借以了解情况，便利金融市场的管理。
    （六）清算问题。过去三个月上海分行的汇款除六月份汇出为汇入的百分之六十三外，七八两月经常汇入大于汇出，七月份汇出款为汇入款之百分之七十四，，八月份汇出为汇入的百分之六十四。因此截至八月底止各联行轧欠上海分行款合计达六八，五八九六万元，截至九月十二日止已达一○八亿元，此项欠款之清算调拨亟须由总行或区行解决。
    　　　　三、怎样改进内汇业务
    要积极开展内汇业务，根据三个月来之经验提供下列各点以作改进之参考：
    （一）必须加强业务观念，建立人民银行的汇兑业务信用。联行之间要根据部分利益服从整体利益的原则充分发挥合作精神。汇出汇款固要全力争取，对于汇入款的解付也要同样的重视，力求迅速。因为照顾了收款人的利益也就是提高了人民银行汇兑的信誉。
    （二）汇兑限额要逐渐提高，最后达到无限额，如此汇兑金额势必增加。为了实行集中清算制度，应在各大城市设立发行库，以便统一调度资金。利用买汇的方式进行清算，不足以应付大量资金调度之需要，且依此法进行清算，使汇水的涨落波动足以刺激物价。
    （三）由于汇兑代表两地物资输送的反方向，所以我们要加强各地农产，工商业情况的调查研究工作，充分了解各地物资以及资金往还的关系，例如浙江平水、杭州、温州、遂安等地产茶，每届新茶上市，各地商人前往收购，则上述各地的汇入款必增，必须事先布置，筹划头寸，各地联行并应交换物资交流的情报，保持联系。
    （四）依据各地物价以及头寸供求情况灵活而主动的掌握汇水，不要完全跟踪私营行庄的汇率。并以廉价多汇为原则。
    （五）汇兑实务方面要划一规定业务处理手续，统一汇兑章则与汇兑密码，训练密押人员达到迅速而准确的标准，拟订套写的查询书，建立汇款查询制度，搜集资料编制有关的统计表报。各联行的会计制度也必须一致。
