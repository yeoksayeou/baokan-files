[Beijing News] The Mentougou Coal Mine, Chengzicun Coal Mine, and Xishan Coal Mine, all under the public-owned Jingxi Coal Mine Company, conducted safety inspections last month, correcting the erroneous thinking of leaders and workers who had neglected safety, and reducing worker injuries and deaths. From January to the end of October, the Mentougou mine had a total of 16 deaths and 20 serious injuries, while the Chengzicun mine had 9 deaths and 171 serious injuries. However, from November to now (December 10), the Mentougou mine has had no deaths or serious injuries (the Xishan mine is not currently producing coal), and the Chengzicun mine has also had no deaths, with serious injuries reduced to 2 (36 in October, 48 in September), and 109 minor injuries, mostly abrasions.

After liberation, injury and death incidents occurred repeatedly in the various public-owned coal mines of Jingxi. The leadership believed that injuries and deaths were inevitable underground, and individual leading comrades even believed that safety could not be guaranteed if production was to be maintained; workers also had the fatalistic view that "going down the mine means a three-tenths chance of disaster." Therefore, each time an injury or death occurred, only compensation and medical treatment were provided, and everyone was called upon to pay attention. It was not regarded as a matter of responsibility to the people and a matter of class standpoint to be handled with caution, nor was responsibility investigated or lessons learned to avoid the same incidents from happening again. For example, due to outdated explosives and digging out "dud shots" (i.e., shots that failed to ignite), the Mentougou mine had a total of 36 injuries from March to July, and the Xishan mine had three consecutive injuries from February to April, and another death in May. However, the mines still did not pay close attention, resulting in two deaths and five injuries in the Chengzicun mine in August and September. After this safety inspection, most workers now know: "As long as we pay attention, danger can definitely be avoided." "In addition to the supervisors being responsible, we should also help each other, especially taking care of new workers." Leaders and cadres have also realized that as long as workers are educated and vigilance is raised, injuries and deaths can be avoided. They analyzed the past injury and death incidents. The deaths of nine people in the Chengzicun mine were completely avoidable; of the sixteen deaths in the Mentougou mine, both above and below ground, only one was unavoidable due to ground movement and roof collapse, while nine were due to their own carelessness, and six were due to poor equipment and the irresponsibility of supervisors. However, the leadership did not pay enough attention in the past, so they failed to prevent them in time, and repeatedly made the same mistakes.

Before this safety inspection, the Communist Party Committee of the mining area first convened a meeting of party, government, and trade union leaders from the mining area and major mines on November 7. According to the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal Industrial Bureau, it was explained that ensuring worker safety was a matter of the Party's standpoint, a matter of the Party's attitude towards the working class, and that the erroneous thinking of not caring about worker safety must be corrected. This safety inspection mainly involved specific analysis of past injury and death situations, tracing the causes, and clarifying responsibilities. Workers who had done a good job in safety work were rewarded, and those who had made mistakes were given appropriate treatment.

Cadres from each mine first prepared ideologically, and then the administration and trade union convened workers and injured workers to discuss in groups, reviewing each injury and death, unifying understanding, and exchanging experiences. Then, the workers' opinions were collected and submitted to the factory management committee, which, based on the actual situation, proposed personnel who should be punished and rewarded, and summarized the experiences and lessons learned.

Among the eleven production teams in the Mentougou mine, the tenth team did the best job in safety work and had never had any injuries or deaths. The reasons are: (1) The team leader and squad leader are responsible, and the workers are united. Old workers take care of new workers, and new workers learn from old workers. (2) The squad leader is serious about shift handover, and after taking over, he first checks the work site before assigning work. (3) Construction is carried out according to regulations. (4) Workers obey the command and leadership of engineering personnel. (5) Workers have a lot of experience and know how to deal with unexpected events. The main reasons for the occurrence of injuries and deaths are: (1) The leadership neglects safety and emphasizes production. For example, the Chengzicun mine simply praised units that produced a lot of coal, without paying attention to specifications. As a result, workers did not work according to regulations in order to produce more coal, resulting in accidents. (2) Workers do not pay attention to safety, thinking that injuries and deaths are natural, resulting in carelessness at work. In the Mentougou mine, 496 people were injured by pushing coal carts in ten months, accounting for more than one-third of the total number of injuries and deaths, and 465 people were injured by loading and unloading, accounting for slightly less than one-third of the total number of injuries and deaths. (3) The explosives and detonators are not good, and the performance is inconsistent. When they should detonate, they do not, and when workers become impatient and go to investigate, they suddenly explode.

After this inspection and investigation of responsibility, in addition to commending groups and individuals who complied with safety regulations, the leadership also conducted self-criticism. Those who had committed serious errors have been punished. The Mentougou mine dismissed a worker representative and a veteran worker (i.e., a technically skilled worker); two technicians in the Chengzicun mine were given a major demerit, and two supervisors received serious warnings. The Mentougou and Chengzicun mines also adopted workers' opinions and formulated underground safety systems and rules. Now most workers in the mines have attached importance to safety issues. The bad habits of not working according to regulations and stealing coal (i.e., secretly digging coal from the walls of roadways) have been basically eliminated.

The main reasons for the success of this safety inspection are: (1) Resolute implementation of instructions from higher authorities. (2) Promoting democracy and getting cadres to understand the issues. (3) Relying on the working class and following the mass line. However, on the other hand, the mines have not paid enough attention to workers' environmental hygiene and medical equipment. The Mentougou mine has a total of 5,000 workers and family members, but only one doctor and four nurses. The doctor once saw more than 300 patients a day (in June). The Chengzicun mine has a total of 2,100 workers and family members, but only one doctor, one assistant doctor, and two nurses. The doctors have never been down the mines and do not understand the workers' working conditions. Neither clinic has sick leave facilities (the company is currently negotiating with all parties to build a more complete hospital). Seriously injured people must wait for the train to be sent to Beijing for treatment. There is not a single hospital in the entire Mentougou district that can treat fractures. The water that the workers in the Mentougou mine drink is drawn from the bottom of the mine without filtration, containing a lot of sulfate and coal slag. In May, the number of patients with gastrointestinal diseases reached 595, accounting for more than one-third of all medical and surgical patients. In winter, there are especially many coughs, colds, and coal fumes. Workers in the Chengzicun mine have to walk half a mile from their dormitories to the mine entrance to change into their thin or padded clothes, and then wait in line for more than half an hour before going down the mine in turn. In this situation, workers' physical strength and work efficiency will obviously be affected. If the mines can continue to conduct safety education among workers in the future, and also pay attention to workers' environmental hygiene, supplement medical personnel and equipment, and further enable medical personnel to work underground so that injured patients can be treated immediately to avoid the deterioration of injuries, then not only will injuries and deaths be reduced, but illnesses will also be reduced.

### 执行上级指示依靠工人阶级  安全检查获得成绩　京西煤矿伤亡大减

　　执行上级指示依靠工人阶级
    安全检查获得成绩
  　京西煤矿伤亡大减
    【北京讯】公营京西煤矿公司所属门头沟煤矿、城子村煤矿、西山煤矿等矿，上月举行安全检查，纠正了领导上和职工忽视安全的错误思想，减少了工人的伤亡。自一月至十月底，门矿共死十六人，重伤二十人，城矿死九人，重伤一百七十一人。但自十一月迄今（十二月十日），门矿已无死亡与重伤（西山矿现未出煤），城矿亦无死亡，重伤减至二人（十月三十六人，九月四十八人），轻伤一百零九人，多是擦伤。
    解放后，京西各公营煤矿，一再发生伤亡事件。领导上认为井下短不了伤亡，个别领导同志甚至认为要生产就不能保证安全；工人们也有“下井三分灾”的宿命观点。因此，每次发生伤亡，只是抚恤医疗，号召大家注意，并没有把它看作对人民负责和阶级立场问题来慎重处理，也没有追究责任，接受教训，以避免发生同样事件。例如：由于炸药过时爆炸及掏“瞎炮”（即未点着之炮），门矿自三月至七月，共炸伤三十六人，西山矿二月至四月连续炸伤三人，五月又炸死一人。但各矿仍不加紧注意，致城矿八、九两月两次又炸死五人。经过这次安全检查，大部工人已经知道：“只要注意，危险一定能躲开。”“除监工负责外，我们也应该互相帮助，特别照顾新上班的。”领导上和干部们也认识到：只要教育工人，提高警惕，伤亡是可以避免的。他们分析了过去的伤亡事件，城矿所死九人，完全可以避免；门矿井上下共死十六人，只有一个是因为地动落顶，不可避免，其余九个是自己不慎，六个是设备不善和监工的不负责任。但是过去领导上重视不够，以致未能及时防止，而且屡蹈覆辙。
    在这次安全检查之前，首由中共矿区党委会召开矿区和各大矿党政工负责人，在十一月七日举行党内扩大干部会议，根据中共北京市委会和市政府工业局的指示，说明保证工人安全，是党的立场问题，是党对工人阶级的态度问题，不关心工人安全的错误思想，必须纠正。这次安全检查主要是对过去发生伤亡的情况，具体分析，追究原因，明确责任。对安全工作做得好的职工，予以奖励，对有过失的，予以适当处理。
    各矿干部，首先做思想准备，然后由行政上和工会召集职工以及受伤的工人分组讨论，将各次伤亡，一件一件的检讨，统一认识，交流经验。然后再把职工的意见集中到工厂管理委员会，依据实际情况，提出应该处分和奖励的人员，并总结经验教训。
    门矿十一个生产组里，以第十组安全工作作得最好，从来没有过伤亡。原因是：（一）组长、班长负责，工人团结。老工人照顾新工人，新工人向老工人学习。（二）班长交接班认真，接班后先检查工作地点情况，再分派工作。（三）按规矩作工程。（四）工人服从工程人员的指挥和领导。（五）工人经验多，应付意外事件有办法。检讨伤亡发生的原因，主要的有下列三点：（一）领导上忽视安全，强调生产。如城矿单纯表扬产煤多的单位，而没注意规格。以致工人为了多出煤而不按规矩作，致发生意外。（二）工人不重视安全，认为伤亡是当然的，以致工作时疏忽大意，门矿十个月来，因推煤车受伤的即达四百九十六人，占伤亡总数的三分之一强，因装运受伤的亦达四百六十五人，占伤亡总数的三分之一弱。（三）炸药雷管不好，性能不一致，该响时不响，工人等得不耐烦而前往探视时，又突然爆炸。
    经过这次检查，追究责任，除表扬遵守安全规定的团体与个人外，领导上也作了自我检讨。对于犯有严重过失者，已予处罚。门矿开除了一个工人代表和一个老班（即技术熟练之工人）；城矿两个技工被记大过，两个监工受到严重警告。门矿、城矿并采取职工意见，制定了井下安全制度及规则。现在各矿大部职工已重视安全问题。以前不按规矩作活和偷煤（即偷挖巷道墙壁之煤）的恶习，已基本上消除了。
    这次安全检查获得成绩的原因，主要的是：（一）坚决执行了上级的指示。（二）发扬民主，搞通了干部思想。（三）依靠工人阶级，走群众路线。但是另一方面，各矿对于工人的环境卫生和医疗设备还注意不够。门矿职工连家属共五千人，只有一个大夫，四个护士。大夫曾一天看过三百来个病人（六月里）。城矿职工连家属共两千一百人，只有一个大夫，一个助理大夫，两年护士。大夫们从来没下过矿井，不了解工人工作地的情况。两处医务所都没有病休（现公司正与各方面商洽建设一个较完善的医院）。重伤的人必须等火车送到北京城里去治。整修门城区没有一个能治骨折的医院。门矿职工喝的水，就是从矿底下抽上来未经过滤的，硫酸根和煤渣等很多。五月时，肠胃病患者达五百九十五人，占内外科全体病人的三分之一强。到冬天，咳嗽感冒和煤薰的特别多。城矿工人从宿舍换好单的或夹的破衣服，要走半里地，到井口还要排班等半小时以上，依次下井。在这种情形下，工人体力和工作效率，显然要受影响。如果今后各矿除在工人当中继续进行安全教育以外，并能注意工人环境卫生，充实医务人员和设备，进一步使井下有医务人员办公，以便随时有伤患者马上治疗，避免伤患的恶化，那就不但使伤亡的减少，而且也能使病患的也减少了。
