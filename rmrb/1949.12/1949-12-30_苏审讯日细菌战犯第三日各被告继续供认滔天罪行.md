Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th—TASS, Berlik, December 28th: The court session on the morning of December 27th interrogated defendant Kajitsuka Ryuji—former Chief of the Medical Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Lieutenant General Medical Officer, Doctor of Medicine, and expert in bacteriology. Kajitsuka directly led the scientific research of Unit 731, the purpose of which was to find the most effective bacteriological weapons and to experiment with these weapons on living people. The defendant was one of the advocates of researching how to use bacteriological weapons, and he actively supported the demands of Ishii Shiro—the arch-criminal and Japanese bacteriological warfare ideologue—to accelerate the research of bacteriological weapons for combat. Kajitsuka actively participated in the formation of Unit 731 and equipped it with appropriate experts.

Kajitsuka Ryuji is one of the advocates of researching and using bacteriological weapons. He confessed that Unit 731 was established on the order of Hirohito.

The defendant confessed that Unit 731 was established according to a secret order from the Japanese Emperor Hirohito. At the time, Kajitsuka was the Director of the Medical Affairs Department of the Japanese Army Ministry, and therefore was very familiar with the planned activities of this unit. The defendant admitted that he had participated in equipping Unit 731 with highly skilled experts—bacteriologists. He had put effort into having Ishii Shiro appointed as the unit's commander because he and Ishii had a close relationship due to their joint research in bacteriology for a long time.

The state prosecutor asked which leading figures in the Japanese Army Ministry's General Staff and Army Ministry supported and approved of this criminal idea. Kajitsuka replied: Lieutenant General Nogata, who later became the Director-General of the Army Ministry, and Colonel Suzuki, the Director of the First Strategic Division of the General Staff, most actively supported this idea. Ishii Shiro's idea about preparing for bacteriological warfare also received the support of Araki, the former Japanese Minister of the Army. Ishii had presented Araki with a plan to establish a bacteriological unit.

Unit 731 was stationed on the Soviet border in order to prepare for war against the Soviet Union at any time.

Prosecutor: When was Unit 731 established, and based on what decision was it established?

Kajitsuka: Unit 731 was formed at the end of 1935 or the beginning of 1936, according to a secret imperial edict from the Japanese Emperor.

Kajitsuka also confessed: Emperor Hirohito issued an order to expand and reorganize Unit 731, and former Minister of the Army Tojo also issued a special secret order to expedite the implementation of the Emperor's edict.

The defendant said: Before the reorganization, the unit was ostensibly called the "Kwantung Army Staff Department Epidemic Prevention Bureau." After the reorganization, the name was changed to "Kwantung Army Unit Water Supply and Disease Prevention Bureau." The personnel of this so-called bureau had expanded to one thousand people.

Prosecutor: Why were all the detachments of Unit 731 stationed very close to the Soviet border?

Kajitsuka Ryuji: To prepare for war against the Soviet Union at any time.

The defendant confessed that he once visited Unit 731, which was then commanded by Ishii Shiro.

The defendant stated: Ishii Shiro had already devised methods for conducting bacteriological warfare. These methods included spreading fleas infected with plague and bacteria from airplanes, using bacteriological bombs, and conducting sabotage activities. He explained these methods to me in detail. Ishii Shiro then told me about making vegetables, fruits, fish, meat, and other foods contain lethal bacteria, and using these foods to experiment on living people. Ishii Shiro told me that these experiments had yielded "good results," that is to say: everyone died.

Kajitsuka Ryuji then explained to the court how Unit 731 used bacteriological weapons in China proper.

In answering the prosecutor's questions, Kajitsuka Ryuji stated: Personnel from Ishii Shiro's unit had gone to southern Shanghai and spread fleas infected with plague there from airplanes. That experiment proved to be very effective.

Prosecutor: Your profession is a doctor, is it not?

Kajitsuka Ryuji: Yes, Prosecutor.

Prosecutor: In that case, as a doctor, as a representative of a humane profession, did you think that throwing countless fleas infected with plague at the peaceful residents of China was just an experiment?

Kajitsuka Ryuji: I did think so at the time, but it was an inhumane and vicious act.

Defendant Kajitsuka Ryuji then confessed: When he was the Director of the Medical Affairs Bureau of the Kwantung Army, he directly guided Unit 731's "scientific research" regarding the cultivation and use of lethal bacteria, as well as the effects of frostbite.

In answering the prosecutor's questions, defendant Kajitsuka Ryuji confessed that Unit 731 had conducted "experiments" on living people with frostbite with his consent and approval.

Kajitsuka Ryuji revealed the detailed circumstances of Unit 731's criminal activities, attempting to diminish the role he played in preparing for bacteriological warfare and the atrocities committed against living people before the trial. However, when confronted with the testimonies of Yamada and other defendants, he had to fully admit his crimes.

Following this, the court began questioning defendant Sato Shunji.

Interrogation of Defendant Sato Shunji

Major General Medical Officer and Doctor of Medicine, Sato Shunji, served as the commander of the "Wave" Unit (Guangzhou) and the "Rong" Unit (Nanjing) from 1941 to 1944. Later, he served as the Chief of the Medical Affairs Department of the First Army—a part of the Japanese Kwantung Army. He had led the activities of a detachment of Unit 731.

The "Rong" Unit possessed one hundred breeding devices specially for cultivating fleas to propagate plague bacteria.

Sato Shunji did not deny his crime of being one of the direct organizers of preparing for bacteriological warfare.

The defendant confessed: The organizer and first commander of the Nanjing Unit was the well-known bacteriological warfare ideologue, Ishii Shiro, who later served as the commander of Unit 731. The Nanjing Unit had twelve detachments, totaling 1,500 people, many of whom were experts in bacteriology. Overtly, the unit was called the Epidemic Prevention and Water Supply Bureau. In reality, however, most of its personnel, like in Unit 731, were engaged in the preparation of bacteriological weapons. They had special equipment and could produce ten kilograms of lethal bacteria every day. A group of "experts" was engaged in the mass cultivation of fleas. For this purpose, they used special incubators. These fleas were used as a tool to spread plague bacteria.

Prosecutor: What was the situation regarding the "Rong" Unit's cultivation of fleas and plague bacteria?

Sato Shunji: In order to cultivate fleas, the "Rong" detachment possessed one hundred special incubators. The bacteriology department had a special section engaged in the cultivation of plague bacteria.

Sato Directly Organized Bacteriological Warfare, Slaughtering Peaceful Residents in Ningbo and Other Places

Defendant Sato stated: The "Rong" Unit (formerly known as the "Jade" Unit) was dispatched as a base for Unit 731's expeditions to use bacteriological weapons against Chinese troops and peaceful residents.

Sato served as the Chief of the Medical Affairs Department of the Fifth Army (a part of the Kwantung Army) in 1944. At that time, he actively helped the 643rd Detachment increase the production of bacteriological equipment.

Sato then further confessed: Defendant Onoue (commander of the 643rd detachment of Unit 731) had requested his help in increasing the production of bacteriological weapons. He needed mice and other things to breed fleas. Sato, through the personnel of the Fifth Army, ordered the troops to capture mice and send them to the 643rd Detachment.

Prosecutor: Defendant Sato, what do you know about the "Rong" Unit's participation in Unit 731's bacteriological warfare against the Chinese people?

Sato: Bacteriological weapons—spreading fleas infected with plague from airplanes—were used in the Ningbo City area in 1940, in the Changde City area in 1941, and in the Central China campaign in 1942. Some personnel from the "Rong" Unit helped Unit 731 in the Central China campaign.

Sato was also accused of experimenting on living people. He used various prevarications to evade responsibility for these atrocities, but the documents exposed him. The court read out several paragraphs of the stenographic record of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal's trial on August 26, 1946.

This document was submitted to the International Tribunal by Assistant Chief Prosecutor Sutton (United States) and was accepted by the court as evidence.

Sato personally admitted: This document records the atrocities of the "Jade" Unit (also known as the "Rong" Unit). These atrocities were the same as those committed in Unit 731's prison.

Interrogation of Defendant Hirasakura Zensaku

Hirasakura Zensaku was the head of Unit 100 and personally participated in the dispatch team sent to the Soviet border.

From July 1942 until the Kwantung Army surrendered to the Soviet Army, Hirasakura Zensaku was the responsible head of Unit 100. Hirasakura told the court: Unit 100 was called the Kwantung Army Animal Infectious Disease Experiment Bureau to cover up its activities. In fact, it was mainly engaged in preparing for bacteriological warfare. The unit's headquarters was located in Mengjiatun, a few kilometers away from Changchun. The unit was directly subordinate to the Kwantung Army through the Veterinary Bureau Chief, defendant Takahashi. Unit 100 had detachments in Dalian, Hailar, and other places, with several groups in each detachment. Later, the Hailar detachment was moved to another location. The personnel of Unit 100's headquarters numbered as many as 800 people.

Prosecutor: What infectious diseases were mainly used in bacteriological warfare? Hirasakura: Glanders, rinderpest, and anthrax.

Hirasakura also described to the court the circumstances of the dispatch team sent by Unit 100 to the Soviet border area, in which he had personally participated.

Hirasakura described in court the circumstances of Unit 100 conducting bacteriological experiments on living people. These experiments were carried out by defendant Mitomo.

Interrogation of Defendant Takahashi Takaatsu

The court interrogated defendant Takahashi Takaatsu, Lieutenant General Veterinary Officer, during the afternoon session on December 27th. From 1941 until Japan's surrender, Takahashi served as the Director of the Kwantung Army Veterinary Bureau. Takahashi directly guided the activities of Unit 100 and actively participated in preparing for bacteriological warfare. He often promoted the idea that bacteriological weapons were one of the most effective methods of warfare.

Takahashi Confessed

Manufacturing Bacteriological Weapons to Prepare for War Against the Soviet Union

Defendant Takahashi confessed in court: The mission of Unit 100 was to manufacture bacteria on a large scale as a means of bacteriological warfare and bacteriological sabotage.

Prosecutor: Against which country was the bacteriological warfare to be carried out? Takahashi replied: Mainly against the Soviet Union.

Prosecutor: What bacteria did Unit 100 cultivate to use as weapons of bacteriological warfare? Takahashi replied: Anthrax, glanders, mottled disease, and rinderpest bacteria.

Prosecutor: In September 1941, who ordered General Wakamatsu, the commander of Unit 100, to begin large-scale manufacturing of bacteria? Takahashi replied: At that time, I was the Director of the Veterinary Bureau. I directly issued the order in the name of General Umezu, the Commander of the Kwantung Army.

Defendant Takahashi then described the activities of Unit 100. He said: Unit 100 had several detachments in the Manchurian territory along the Soviet border. These detachments were the outpost units of Unit 100.

Takahashi confessed: He had personally taken measures to accelerate the large-scale manufacturing of glanders bacteria and other bacteria. Then he said: A group of personnel from Unit 100, under his order and with the consent of the Second Intelligence Division of the Kwantung Army, went to Bei'an Province in 1944 to collect information about the herds of animals in the rivers, ponds, pastures, and grasslands. This sabotage intelligence group was led by defendant Hirasakura.

Prosecutor: What was the ultimate purpose of this reconnaissance? Takahashi replied: The purpose was that, once a war broke out between Japan and the Soviet Union, Unit 100 would be able to cause all the livestock in the province to become infected with infectious diseases and drive them towards the Soviet army's operational areas.

Defendant Takahashi admitted in response to the prosecutor's questions that he himself was responsible for Unit 100 conducting bacteriological experiments on living people. The court's afternoon session also interrogated defendant Mitomo Katsuo.

　　苏审讯日细菌战犯第三日各被告继续供认滔天罪行
  　审讯被告＠冢龙二
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社伯力二十八日讯：十二月二十七日上午开庭审问被告＠冢二——前日本关东军医务局局长、中将医官、医学博士兼细菌学专家。＠冢直接领导七三一部队的科学研究，这种工作是在于设法发现最有效的细菌武器并把这种武器在活人身上进行实验，被告是研究如何使用细菌武器的倡导者之一，他积极支持石井四郎——首恶的日本细菌战理理想家——的要求，加紧研究用于作战的细菌武器，＠冢积极参与组成七三一部队并为七三一部队配备适当的专家。
    ＠冢龙二是研究和使用细菌武器的倡导人之一，他供认：七三一部队是奉裕仁之命成立的。
    被告供认：七三一部队系依照日本天皇裕仁的密令成立的，当时＠冢是日本陆军省军医署署长，因此很了解这个部队的计划中的活动。被告承认，他曾参与为七三一部队配备高度熟练的专家——细菌学家，他曾出力使石井四郎被委为该部队长官。因为他与石井曾因共同研究细菌学而长时期交往甚密。
    国家检察官讯以日本陆军部参谋部和陆军省里那些首要人员支持和赞同这种罪恶意见，＠冢答称：后来担任陆军省总务长的野方中将和总参谋部第一战略处处长铃木上校等最积极支持这种意见。石井四郎关于准备细菌战的意见还得到前日本陆相荒木的支持，石井曾向荒木提出关于成立细菌部队的计划。
    七三一部队驻扎苏联边境为的是准备随时对苏作战
    检察官：七三一部队是什么时候成立的，根据什么决定成立的？
    ＠冢：七三一部队是在一九三五年末或一九三六年初奉日本天皇的秘密敕令组成的。
    ＠冢又供认：天皇裕仁发出过扩大和改编七三一部队的勒令，前陆相东条也下过特别密令，命令加速执行天皇这个敕令。
    被告说：该部队在重编之前表面上称为“关东军参谋部防疫局”，改编之后的名称叫“关东军部队用水供应及疾病预防局”。这个所谓局的人员曾扩充到一千人。
    检察官：为什么七三一部队的所有支队全都驻扎在苏联边境非常近的地方呢？
    ＠冢龙二：准备随时对苏作战。
    被告供称：有一次他去访问当时由石井四郎所统率的七三一部队。
    被告称：石井四郎已经拟出进行细菌战的方法，这些方法包括从飞机上散布染有鼠疫的足蚤和细菌、利用细菌炸弹以及进行破坏活动。他对我详细说明这些方法。石井四郎继而告诉我使菜蔬、水果、鱼、肉、及其他食品里含有致死的细菌，并用这些食品来对活人做实验的情形。石井四郎对我说，这些实验得到“良好的结果”，就是说：人全死了。
    ＠冢龙二继而向法庭说明七三一部队如何在中国本部运用细菌武器。
    ＠冢龙二回答检察官的讯问时称：石井四郎部队的人员曾去上海南部并且从飞机上往那里散布染有鼠疫的跳蚤。那次实验证明是非常有效。
    检察官：你的职业是医生，对吧？
    ＠冢龙二：是的，检察官。
    检察官：这样说来，你身为医生，身为一种人道的职业的代表者，竟以为把无数染有鼠疫的跳蚤投向中国的和平居民只是一种实验吗？
    ＠冢龙二：当时的确以为是的，但是那是一种惨无人道的毒辣的行为。
    被告＠冢龙二继又供称：当他任关东军医务局局长时，他曾直接指导七三一部队关于培养与利用致死的细菌以及冻伤效果等这些方面的“科学研究。”
    在答复检察官讯问时，被告＠冢龙二供认七三一部队曾在他的同意与认可之下来对冻伤的活人做“实验”。
    ＠冢龙二供出七三一部队的罪恶活动的详细情况，企图在审判前贬低他在准备细菌战争和对活人所做的那些暴行中所充任的角色。但是用山田及其他被告的供词来向他质对时，他不得不完全承认他的罪状。
    继之法庭开始审问被告佐藤春二。
    审讯被告偌藤春二
    少将医官、医学博士佐藤春二自一九四一年至一九四四年曾任“波”部队（广州）和“荣”部队（南京）长官，后来担任第一军——日本关东军之一部——医务处长，他曾领导七三一部队一个支队的活动。
    “荣”部队拥有百架繁育器专门培养跳蚤繁殖鼠疫菌
    佐藤春二对于他是准备细菌战的直接组织者之一的罪状供认不讳。
    被告供认：南京部队的组织者和首任长官是著名的细菌战思想家石井四郎，石井后来担任七三一部队长官。南京部队有十二个支队，共一千五百人，其中有许多细菌学专家。表面是该部队称为防疫及供水局。但实际上，其大部分人员象在七三一部队一样，都从事细菌武器的准备工作。他们有特殊设备，每天能制造十公斤的致死的细菌。一群“专家”曾从事大批培养跳蚤，为了这个目的他们使用特殊的孵育器。这些跳蚤被用作散布鼠疫菌的工具。
    检察官：“荣”部队培养跳蚤和鼠疫菌的情形如何？
    佐藤春二：为了培养跳蚤，“荣”支队拥有一百架特殊的孵育器、细菌处有专门的一科从事培殖鼠疫细菌的工作。
    佐藤曾直接组织细菌战屠杀宁波等地和平居民
    被告佐藤称：“荣”部队（以前称为“玉”部队）是被派遣以细菌武器对付中国军队与和平居民的七三一部队进行远征的基地。
    佐藤在一九四四年担任第五军（关东军的一部）的医务处长，他当时积极地帮助六四三支队增加细菌设备的产量。
    佐藤然后又供称：被告尾上（七三一部队六四支队长）曾要求他帮助增加细菌武器的产量。他需要老鼠等等的东西来繁殖跳蚤。佐藤通过第五军的人员下令部队捕捉老鼠送给六四三支队。
    检察官：被告佐藤，你所知道的关于“荣”部队参加七三一部队对中国人民的细菌战的情形如何？
    佐藤：一九四○年在宁波城地区，一九四一年在常德城地区和一九四二年在华中战役中都使用了细菌武器——把染有鼠疫的跳蚤自飞机上向下散播。“荣”部队的某些人员在华中战役中帮助七三一部队。
    佐藤还被控对活人进行实验之罪。他用种种遁辞来规避对这种暴行的责任，但是文件揭穿了他。法庭宣读一九四六年八月二十六日东京国际军事法庭审讯速记记录的若干段。
    这一文件是由首席检察官助理沙顿（美国）提交国际法庭，并被法庭接受为证据。
    偌藤亲自承认：这个文件里记载着“玉”部队（也称“荣”部队）的暴行。这些暴行与七三一部队监狱中所进行的暴行一样。
    审讯被告平樱善作　
    平樱善作是一百号部队的负责人，曾亲自参加派向苏联边境的派遣队。
    从一九四二年七月直到关东军向苏军投降，平樱善作一直是一百号部队的负责长官。平樱对法庭说：一百号部队为了掩护其活动而称为关东军兽类传染病试验局。而事实上，它主要从事准备细菌战。该部队的总部及设在距长春数公里的孟家屯。该部队通过兽医局长被告高桥直接隶属于关东军。一百号部队在大连，海拉尔等地设有支队，每支队设几个组。后来海拉尔支队又移到另外一个地方。一百号部队总部的人员多达八百人。
    检察官：在细菌战中主要利用什么传染病？平樱：鼻疽病，牛瘟，及炭疽热病。
    平樱又向法庭叙述一百号部队派到苏联边境地区的派遣队的情形，他曾亲自参加这种派遣队。
    平樱在法庭上叙述一百号部队对活人进行细菌实验的情形。这些实验由被告三友执行。
    审讯被告高桥高笃
    法庭在十二月二十七日下午开庭时审讯被告高桥高笃中将兽医官。从一九四一年直到日本投降，高桥一直担任关东军兽医局长。高桥直接指导一百号部队的活动，并且极积极地参与准备细菌战。他经常宣传细菌武器是战争最有效的方法之一。
    高桥供认
    制造细菌武器准备对苏作战
    被告高桥在法庭上供称：一百号部队的任务是大规模制造细菌、作为细菌战及细菌破坏的手段。
    检察官：细菌战是对什么国家进行？高桥答：主要是对苏联。
    检察官：一百号部队培殖什么细菌来用作细菌战的武器？高桥答：炭疽热，鼻疽病，斑驳病及牛瘟的细菌。
    检察官：一九四一年九月间谁命令一百号部队长官若松将军开始大规模制造细菌？高桥答：那时我是兽医局局长。直接由我以关东军司令梅津将军的名义下令。
    被告高桥继而叙述一百号部队的活动。他说：一百号部队在沿苏联边境的满洲领土内有若干支队，这些支队是一百号部队的前哨部队。
    高桥供称：他曾亲自采取措施，加速大批制造鼻疽病细菌及其他细菌。然后他说：一百号部队曾有一批人员于一九四四年奉他的命令并且在关东军第二谍报处的同意之下前往北兴安省收集关于在河流，水池，牧场及草原一带的畜群的情报。这个从事破坏活动的谍报组由被告平樱领导。
    检察官：这种侦察的最后目的是什么？高桥答称：目的是一旦日苏发生战争的时候，一百号部队能够使该省的所有牲畜都流行传染病，并将它们赶向苏军的作战地区。
    被告高桥在回答检察官的问题时承认他本人负一百号部队对活人进行细菌试验的责任。法庭的下午庭并审讯了被告三友胜雄。
