Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 30th – The People's Liberation Army has victoriously concluded the large-scale encirclement and annihilation battle in the Chengdu area. The last main force of the Kuomintang reactionaries remaining on the mainland, the Hu Zongnan bandit troops, were completely eliminated by our forces on the 27th, and Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, was declared liberated on the same day. After the Second Field Army and a part of the Fourth Field Army began to approach Chengdu from the southeast, west, and north, the Hu bandit Zongnan ordered his three corps to break through towards Ya'an and Xichang along the Sichuan-Kangding Highway, with his 5th Corps as the vanguard, the 18th Corps in the center, and the 7th Corps bringing up the rear. The Hu bandit himself fled to Taipei from Guanghan on the 23rd. When the vanguard of the bandit army fled to Qionglai, Pujiang, and Xinjin, the pocket-shaped positions pre-arranged by our Second and Fourth Field Armies in this area were completed. At the same time, our First Field Army also marched south at great speed from southern Shaanxi and southern Gansu, arriving in time at Guanghan and the line east and west of it, on the outskirts of Chengdu. At this point, the Hu bandit troops were completely trapped in our army's encirclement, with no way to escape. On the 25th, our army launched an attack, and by the 27th, the battle was victoriously concluded and Chengdu was liberated. During our army's Chengdu campaign, Dong Zongheng, former Deputy Director of the Kuomintang Sichuan-Hubei Pacification Headquarters, Cao Suyuan, Deputy Commander of the 16th Corps, Zhang Xuanwu, Commander of the 41st Army, and Yan Yi, Commander of the 47th Army, led their troops in uprising in the Jintang and Guanghan areas on the 21st of this month. Luo Guangwen, Commander of the 15th Corps, and Chen Kefei, Commander of the 20th Corps, led three armies in uprising in Peng County on the 24th. Pei Huizeng, Deputy Director of the Kuomintang Sichuan-Shaanxi-Gansu Border Area Pacification Headquarters and Commander of the 7th Corps, led more than 10,000 of his troops in uprising in Deyang County on the 25th. Zeng Qingji, Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Joint Logistics 4th Supply Area and Commander of the 4th Supply Sub-area, Ouyang Jiaqing, Commander of the 41st Supply Sub-area, and Xiong Zhiding, Deputy Commander of the Liaison and Transportation Command of the 7th Supply Area, led all the officers and soldiers of more than 80 units of the Southwest Joint Logistics in uprising in Chengdu on the 23rd. Up to now, of the approximately 300,000 Hu Zongnan bandit troops and other Kuomintang troops remaining in Sichuan, apart from those who have revolted or surrendered since the 9th of this month, the vast majority have been annihilated, and those scattered and fleeing are being searched for and eliminated by our army. Now the Kuomintang bandit army in the Southwest region has been basically eliminated. The He Guoguang troops remaining in the southern part of western Kangding, the Eighth Army of Li Mi in southern Yunnan, and the 26th Army of Yu Chengwan, totaling less than 40,000 men, will be quickly annihilated if they do not immediately awaken and return to the people. The people of the Southwest are welcoming the first liberated New Year of 1950 with the joy of celebrating their own liberation.

  　胡宗南匪军全部就歼 
    四川省会成都解放
    【新华社西南前线三十日电】人民解放军已胜利结束了成都地区的大围歼战，国民党反动派残留在大陆上的最后一支主力胡宗南匪部已于二十七日被我全部解决，四川省会成都亦于同日宣告解放。自第二野战军和第四野战军一部开始从东南西三面迫近成都后，胡匪宗南即令其所辖的三个兵团沿川康公路向雅安、西昌方向突围，以其五兵团为前锋，十八兵团居中，第七兵团断后，胡匪本人则于二十三日由广汉逃台北。当匪军先头部队逃抵邛崃、蒲江、新津一带时，我第二、第四两野战军在该地区所预布的袋形阵地即已完成。同时我第一野战军亦以飞快速度分路从陕南、甘南兼程南下，及时进抵成都外围广汉及其东西之线。至此，胡部匪军即完全陷入我军的包围圈内，无路可逃。二十五日，我军开始发动攻击，至二十七日即胜利结束战斗，解放成都。当我军在成都战役期间，先后有原国民党川鄂绥署副主任董宗珩、十六兵团副司令曹苏元、四十一军军长张宣武、四十七军军长严翊等率部于本月二十一日在金堂、广汉地区起义，第十五兵团司令罗广文、二十兵团司令陈克非等率三个军于廿四日在彭县起义，国民党川陕甘边区绥署副主任兼第七兵团司令裴会曾率所部万余人于二十五日在德阳县起义，国民党联勤第四补给区副司令兼第四补给分区司令曾庆集、第四一补给分区司令欧阳家清、第七补给区连输司令部副司令熊志等于二十三日率所部西南联勤八十余单位全体员兵在成都起义。至此残留在四川的胡宗南匪部及其他国民党部队约三十万，除自本月九日以来先后起义及投诚者外，其绝大部分业已就歼，其零星逃散者，正被我军搜捕肃清中。现在西南地区国民党匪军已基本上被消灭，残存西康南部地区的贺国光部，云南南部的第八军李弥部及二十六军余程万部共计不到四万人，如不立即觉悟，归向人民，亦不难迅速就歼。西南人民正以欢庆自己解放的心情，迎接一九五○年第一个解放后的新年。
