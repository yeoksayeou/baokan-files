He also presented each martyr's family with two hundred bricks of tea as a sign of cordial sympathy. On November 13, he went to the headquarters of the Yining National Army to represent the People's Liberation Army in extending greetings to the brotherly troops of the National Army in the Yili, Tacheng, and Altay regions. He presented the brotherly troops of the National Army with two thousand bricks of tea, a silk banner, and two American-made bazookas captured by the First Corps in battle against the Kuomintang bandit troops. Commander Wang delivered a speech at the rally to review the Yining city defense battalion of the National Army, saying: The convergence of the People's Liberation Army and the National Army has become an invincible people's armed force. The two should learn from each other and exchange experiences. The National Army is the army of the sons and daughters of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, familiar with the languages, customs, and habits of the people, and should work with the People's Liberation Army to do a good job in mass work. All units of the National Army should strengthen political education.
