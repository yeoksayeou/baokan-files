Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 24th: Winter school work has been widely launched in Northeast and North China. In many areas of Jilin Province, winter schools began in early December, with approximately 600,000 students enrolled. In non-disaster areas of Liaoxi Province, winter schools have also started, while in disaster areas, they are being established selectively in areas where production and self-help have been successful. Liaodong and Songjiang provinces have each selected a county for pilot programs. Winter schools in the suburbs of Shenyang City also began in late November, with 400 students and teachers from various schools participating in the work. In the near suburbs of Changchun City, winter schools have officially opened in two districts. The Lüda area continues to promote the literacy movement. This year, winter schools in the Northeast are mainly focused on village and township cadres and organized masses, with cultural courses as the primary focus and political courses as secondary. In the work, attention is paid to strengthening organizational leadership. Liaodong, Jilin, and other provinces have established unified winter school committees at all levels and formulated plans to promote the work. In mobilizing the masses to attend winter school, all localities have paid attention to preventing coercion and have adopted methods of in-depth publicity and patient persuasion.

In the North China region, Shanxi Province has opened approximately 17,000 winter schools, with 1.2 million men and women farmers enrolled. In the Cangxian area of Hebei, winter schools have opened in more than 500 villages in eight counties, including Suning and Hejian, with over 23,000 students enrolled. In the Dingxian area, 725 winter schools of various forms have been established in counties such as Xinle and Boye, with over 27,000 students enrolled. In Suiyuan Province, 116 winter schools have been established in five counties, including Fengzhen and Xinghe. Winter schools have also opened in some areas of Chahar and Pingyuan provinces. In the North China provinces, due to the completion of land reform in most areas, the enthusiasm of the masses for learning exceeds any previous year. All localities have also made full preparations before the start of school, first by conscientiously training teachers. In Hebei Province, compulsory teachers were trained in late October. In Jiahe and Hejian counties alone, 893 people were trained. In Shanxi Province, more than 9,000 intellectuals and teachers in the countryside were trained in Changzhi, Yuci, and other four districts to serve as voluntary teachers in winter schools. In terms of teaching materials, the Propaganda and Education Committee of Shanxi Province has compiled and printed political teaching materials for farmers in winter schools, with the Common Program as the main content. The Taiyuan branch of Xinhua Bookstore has sold more than 90,000 copies of textbooks for people's schools. In learning, all localities are generally able to proceed in conjunction with the overall situation in the local area, and on the principle of not affecting production. Many areas have adopted itinerant teaching or group study by production sector. Some local government organs and stationed troops actively assist in the establishment of winter schools, sending cadres to attend classes in nearby winter schools, which promotes the work of winter schools.
