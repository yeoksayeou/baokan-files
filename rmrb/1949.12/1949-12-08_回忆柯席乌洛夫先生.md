　　Remembering Comrade Kosygin
    Jiang Shan
    I was surprised to read the phrase "the deceased 'Russian Reader' editor Kosygin" in Mr. Cao Jinghua's "New Translation of Selected Works of Lu Xun in Russian" in the "People's Literature and Art" section of the People's Daily on November 27th. I woke up that night and repeatedly recalled the impressions that Comrade Kosygin had left on me.
    In the winter of 1945, I was studying at Great China University in Shanghai. At the same time, I squeezed out time to attend the Shanghai Russian Language School. The Russian school was established under extremely difficult conditions. It borrowed the site of a primary and secondary school, divided into morning and evening classes. The morning class was from 7:00 to 8:00, and the evening class was from 8:00 to 9:00, using other people's spare time to rent classrooms for classes. However, due to the enthusiasm of Chinese progressive youths for learning Russian and the particularly low tuition fees of the school, although the time was early and late, quite a few young men and women came to study.
    The first class was taught by a Chinese teacher. He told us that the course would be shared by him and a Soviet citizen, Comrade Kosygin. We were all very excited and looked forward to meeting him soon. The next day, the second class, Mr. Gu introduced him to us. He was tall, looked to be about forty or fifty years old, with golden and somewhat disheveled hair, but his face was rosy and he looked particularly energetic. He showed a sincere and harmonious smile as he stood in front of the podium and said "Zdravstvuyte" (Good morning). The weather outside was very cold, and he was still steaming when he entered the classroom; he pushed his glasses up onto his forehead, picked up the book, and began to lecture. He spoke slowly and clearly, mostly using gestures, and occasionally explaining in Chinese. It wasn't until nearly eight o'clock, when the primary and secondary school students downstairs began to make noise, sometimes even banging open the door of our classroom, that he closed the book and said "Dosvidanya" (Goodbye)! This was my first impression of Comrade Kosygin.
    In Shanghai, especially in winter, there were still very few pedestrians on the road at seven o'clock in the morning, but he was never late. Once I was late and rushed into the classroom, forgetting to close the door. He came over and gently closed the door, smiling and saying "Good morning" to me in Chinese. He didn't scold me, nor did he ridicule me, but I felt very embarrassed; I never dared to be late again after that. Every time he arrived before seven o'clock, he would ask everyone if they had any difficulties. In class, half of the time was spent lecturing and half was spent on conversation practice. He patiently asked each student about the vocabulary they had learned in turn. If they answered correctly, he would smile and praise "Khorosho" (Very good); if they couldn't answer, he would ask someone else. After class, he wouldn't leave immediately, but always enthusiastically answered questions for the students.
    He also never missed a class. One day, the school worker didn't come for some reason, and the classroom door hadn't been opened by seven o'clock. We didn't have class that day, and we all thought it didn't matter, but he asked us to make up for this lesson on Sunday morning.
    He worked at the Epoch Publishing House during the day and came to the Russian school in the morning and evening to teach. At that time, he told us that the school had received warnings from the Kuomintang secret service, but they did not retreat because of this. He also told us that he and Mr. Gu were still planning to compile a "Chinese-Russian Dictionary". He was so busy all day long, not for personal life, but for the exchange of Chinese and Soviet culture, and for teaching Chinese youth.
    Comrade Kosygin has passed away. He was an ordinary Soviet citizen. However, his spirit and impressions will always remain in the hearts of the Chinese youth who have been educated and helped by him.

### 回忆柯席乌洛夫先生

　　回忆柯席乌洛夫先生
    江  山
    在十一月二十七日人民日报“人民文艺”曹靖华先生的“新译俄文鲁迅选集”中，读到“已去世之‘俄文读本’编者柯席乌洛夫”一语，使我感到惊讶。那天夜里醒来，我翻复地回忆着柯席乌洛夫先生所留给我的印象。
    一九四五年冬天，我在上海大夏大学念书，同时，又挤出时间来上了上海俄文专修学校。俄专是在极困难的条件之下成立的，借着一个中小学的校址，分早夜两班，早班是七点到八点，夜班是八点到九点，利用人家的课余时间，租借教室上课。但由于中国进步青年学习俄文的热情，和学校收费特别低廉，虽然时间上是起早落晚，来上学的男女青年也相当不少。
    第一堂是雇用中先生上的，他告诉我们：本课程将由他和一位苏联人柯席乌洛夫先生来分担，我们都很兴奋，并盼望早一点见到他。隔一天，第二次上课，雇先生就把他介绍给我们了。他高大的个儿，看上去大概有四五十岁了，头上留着金黄而有点颓的头发，但是脸色红润，精神显得特别饱满。他站到讲台面前就露出了诚恳而和睦的笑容，说一声“斯特拉夫斯特”（早安）。外面天气很冷，他走进教室后，头上还直冒着热气；他把眼镜往上一推，戴在额角上，拿起书来就开始讲课。他讲得慢而清楚，多半是比手势，偶而也用中文解释，直到将近八点钟，楼下的中小学生开始吵闹，有时把我们的教室门也撞开的时候，他才合上书本，说一声“杜斯维达尼亚”（再见）！这是柯席乌洛夫先生给我的第一个印象。
    在上海，尤其是冬天，清早七点钟马路上的行人还很稀少，但是，他从来没有迟到过。有一次我迟到了，匆忙地撞进教室去，忘了关门。他过来轻轻地把门关上，用中文笑着对我说“早安”。他不是骂我，也不是讥笑我，但我心里感到非常不好意思；自从那一次以后，我也没有敢迟到过。每一次他都在七点以前赶到，就问问大家有什么困难。上课时，，一半是讲授，一半是会话练习。他很耐心地把学过的生字来轮流地问着每一个同学，答得对的，他就笑着称赞“哈拉萧”（很对）；答不出来就再问别人。下课后，他也不立刻就走，总是热心地为同学们解答疑难。
    他也是从来不缺课的。有一天，校工不知何故没有来，七点多钟了还没有把教室门打开，那天我们就没有上课，我们都认为无所谓，他却要求我们在下星期日的早上补上了这一课。
    他白天在时代社工作，早夜来俄专上课。那时，他告诉我们：校方曾接到过国民党特务机关的警告，他们没有因此而退缩。他又告诉我们：他同顾先生还在计划着编纂一本“中俄辞典”。他这样终日忙碌，不是为了个人生活，而是为了交流中苏文化，为了教导中国的青年。
    柯席乌洛夫先生去世了，他是一个平凡的苏联人。但是，他的精神和印象，将永远遗留在受过他教育和帮助的中国青年的心里。
