Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, December 8th: The Australian Communist Party has nominated twenty Senate candidates and thirty-two House of Representatives candidates to participate in the Australian Federal Parliament election.

The characteristics of this Australian election campaign are the similarity of the policies of the ruling Labor Party and the Liberal Party and Country Party coalition, which act as the "opposition party"; another characteristic is the increase in fascist atrocities against progressive candidates. Communist candidates have been banned from giving radio speeches on all state-run and commercial radio stations, their talks published in newspapers are subject to censorship, and most meeting places are not allowed for their use. When gathering in the streets, they are subjected to interference from the police and hooligans. Organized thugs often travel from city to city, engaging in violence, throwing things at people, and even throwing nitric acid at Communist speakers.

The Australian Communist Party, facing its first threat of being banned in ten years, announced on the eve of this election that it has full confidence in its unwavering opposition to the monopoly capitalist groups led by Menzies (Liberal Party) and Fadden (Country Party), and in its ability to unite the brave and combative Australian working class to meet the current arduous tasks.

　　反动派暴力劫持选举
  　澳共竞选横遭阻挠
    【新华社北京十二日电】据电通社悉尼八日讯：澳大利亚共产党已提出二十名参议员候选人和三十二名众议员候选人参加澳大利亚联邦议会的竞选。
    此次澳大利亚竞选运动的特点，是执政的工党和作为“反对党”的自由党和乡村党联盟的政策相似；另一特点是反对进步候选人的法西斯暴行的增多。共产党候选人已被禁止在一切国营及商用电台发表广播演说，他们在报纸上发表的谈话要受到检查，大多数的集会场所不准他们使用，在街上集会时，受到警察和流氓的干涉。有组织的打手时常一城一城地巡游，进行暴力行为，投掷东西打人，甚至把硝镪水撒在共产党演说者的身上。
    十年来遭受到第一次被禁止的危险的澳大利亚共产党，在这次选举的前夕宣布，它的不屈不挠的反对由孟席斯（自由党）和费登（乡村党）领导的垄断资本家集团，以及它对于勇敢的富有战斗性的澳大利亚工人阶级团结一致以迎接当前艰难任务的能力，具有充分的信心。
