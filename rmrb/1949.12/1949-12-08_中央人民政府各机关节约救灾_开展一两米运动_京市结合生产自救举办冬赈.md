Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th — The central government organs, in order to launch an economy and disaster relief movement, convened an economy and disaster relief meeting on November 29th by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, decided to establish the "Central People's Government Organs Economy and Disaster Relief Committee." Continue the "One or Two Jin of Rice" campaign of the original North China People's Government, and stipulate that each staff member of the organs shall save two jin of millet per month from November to the end of February next year to help the disaster victims. In order to ensure that the saved rice reaches the victims quickly, the meeting decided that the saved rice will not be converted into cash, but the Economy and Disaster Relief Committee will discuss with the Ministry of Finance to allocate the actual deducted millet each month to the disaster-stricken provinces, which will be paid under the central grain item of each province and forwarded to the disaster areas.

[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to help the refugees who were displaced to the city by the floods, and the workers and poor citizens who were unemployed due to the long-term exploitation and oppression by the reactionary government in the past, has been organizing relief projects since the middle of last month by the relevant departments such as the Construction Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and the Suburban Committee of the Municipal Government, and is preparing to issue production subsidies and relief food to combine winter relief work with production and self-relief. At the same time, it conducts education on self-reliance among citizens, promotes the principle of focusing on relief, and focuses on criticizing the idea of ​​simply relying on relief and the tendency of egalitarianism. The specific relief methods are: (1) Those with labor power are used in the form of work-for-relief. The projects that have been initially completed include repairing dirt roads, sidewalks, and dredging the Yuhe River. A total of more than 22,000 people participated in the above-mentioned work-for-relief labor, and more than 160,000 jin of millet has been issued. In addition, more than 5,800 people are carrying out quarrying projects. (2) Those who have no labor power, or who have labor power but lack production capital, or who have no fixed occupation and therefore lack clothing and food and cannot maintain their lives, will be issued relief food or production subsidies after the district offices and public security police stations have investigated and verified. In the suburbs, 125,000 jin of grain have been allocated, which will be managed by the Suburban Committee of the Municipal Government. In the urban area, the district offices of each district are conducting key re-examinations based on the preliminary investigations of the public security police stations, and the first batch of more than 200,000 jin of grain will be distributed to the districts within days. (3) For those who are severely short of winter clothes, the government will issue winter clothes based on the situation, and the distribution method is under study. (4) Those who are homeless and have no labor power will continue to be taken in by the districts and sent to the production and education institutes (formerly relief homes) under the Civil Affairs Bureau for resettlement separately.

　　中央人民政府各机关节约救灾
  　开展一两米运动
    京市结合生产自救举办冬赈
    【新华社北京七日电】中央人民政府各机关，为展开节约救灾运动，于十一月二十九日由内务部召开节约救灾会议，决定成立“中央人民政府机关节约救灾委员会”。继续进行原华北人民政府的一两米运动，并规定各机关工作人员自十一月份起，至明年二月底止，每人每月节约小米二斤，救助灾民。为保证节约米迅速到达灾民手中，会议决定该项节约米不折现款，即由节约救灾委员会商同财政部，将每月实扣小米数，拨往受灾各省，于各该省中央粮项下开支，转发灾区。
    【北京讯】京市人民政府为救助水灾流离本市的难民，及因过去遭受反动政府长期剥削压迫而失业的工人及贫困市民，已自上月中旬起，由建设局、民政局、公安局、市府郊委会等有关部门举办赈工程，并准备发放生产补助金及救济粮，使冬令救济工作与生产自救相结合。同时在市民中进行自力更生的教育，宣传重点救助的原则，着重批判了单纯依赖救济的思想与平均主义的倾向。具体的救济办法为：（一）有劳动力者，用以工代赈的方式。现已初步完成的工程有整修土路、便道与疏浚御河。参加上述工赈劳动的共有二万二千余人，已发工赈小米十六万余斤。此外，尚有五千八百余人正在进行采石工程。（二）无劳动力，或虽有劳动力而缺乏生产资本，或无固定职业因而缺衣无食无法维持生活者，经区公所及公安局派出所调查属实后，发给救济粮或生产补助金。郊区方面，已拨给粮食十二万五千斤，由市府郊委会统筹办理。城区方面，各区区公所正在根据公安局派出所的初步调查，进行重点复查，首批粮食二十余万斤日内即将分发各区。（三）御寒衣物奇缺者，政府将斟酌情况发给寒衣，发放办法正在研究中。（四）无家可归而又无劳动力者，由各区继续收容，送交民政局所属生产教养院（即前救济院）分别安置。
