Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 19th: A summary of TASS news from Sofia: The elections for members of the Bulgarian National Assembly and district councils began on the 18th throughout the country.

Throughout the country, voting took place amidst great enthusiasm and active participation of voters. At some polling stations, teams of working people gathered and waited in front of the doors before voting began at 7:00 AM. At 10:00 AM, the Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, Kolarov, personally cast his ballot into the ballot box at polling station number 129 in the fourth district of Sofia. Voters applauded and cheered enthusiastically. At that time, 340 of the 390 registered voters at polling station 129 had already voted.

The first to conclude voting was the village of Korlachevtsi in the Radomir district. This is the hometown of the late Bulgarian leader Dimitrov. Before noon, 85 percent of the voters in Yekholo city in the Yambol district had voted, 70 percent in Tutrakan city, and half of the voters in other cities and towns across the country had voted.

On the evening of the 16th, the Sofia Municipal Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Sofia Municipal Committee of the Fatherland Front held a Sofia Laboring People's Election Congress at the Sofia People's Theater. Two hundred thousand laboring people gathered in the square outside the theater to listen to broadcast speeches. Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Kolarov, and Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Chervenkov, both delivered speeches at the meeting. Chervenkov stated: The elections for the National Assembly and local people's councils are taking place amidst a fierce struggle between the democratic camp led by the great Soviet Union and the imperialist camp. The trials of Rajk in Hungary and Kostov in Bulgaria demonstrate that American and British imperialists and their servant Tito are trying their best to restore fascism in the people's democratic countries and turn their territories into bridgeheads for anti-Soviet struggle. The failure of these plans by American and British imperialists and their agents in our country is clear evidence of the strength and stability of the people's democratic system. Kolarov and Chervenkov called on voters to vote for the candidates of the Fatherland Front, saying that this is a vote for peace, democracy, and socialism, a vote to consolidate Bulgarian-Soviet friendship. The audience inside and outside the People's Theater paid warm tribute to the Bulgarian Communist Party, which is leading the Bulgarian people along the road of building a socialist foundation. Whenever the speakers mentioned Stalin's name, stormy cheers erupted in the hall. After the meeting, the laboring people held a torchlight parade.

　　人民民主制度强大巩固
  　保全国开始议会选举
  　各地人民积极参加投票
    【新华社北京十九日电】综合塔斯社索非亚消息：保加利亚国民议会及区议会议员的选举，十八日已在全国各地开始。
    全国的投票在选民的政治热情巨大高涨和积极参加投票的情形下进行，若干投票站门前在上午七时开始投票以前，已有成队的劳动人民麇集等候。上午十时，保加利亚部长会议主席科拉罗夫亲将选票投到索非亚第四选区第一二九号投票站的票箱中，选民们热烈的鼓掌欢呼，那时，在一二九号投票站登记的三百九十名选民，已有三百四十名投了票。
    投票最先结束的是拉多米尔区的科尔拉契尔齐村。这是保加利亚故领袖季米特洛夫的故乡。在正午以前，杨波尔区耶霍洛城的选民有百分之八十五投了票，吐特拉干城有百分之七十，全国其他城镇都已有半数的选民投了票。
    十六日晚，保加利亚共产党索非亚市委会和祖国阵线市委会，在索非亚人民戏院召开索非亚劳动人民选举大会，二十万劳动人民麇集在戏院外面的广场上聆听广播讲演。部长会议主席科拉罗夫如保共书记契尔文科夫均在会上演讲。契尔文科夫称：国民议会与各地方人民议会的选举，是在以伟大的苏联为首的民主阵营和帝国主义阵营之间的激烈斗争中进行的。匈牙利的拉伊克与保加利亚的科斯托夫审判案，说明了美英帝国主义者及其从仆铁托正竭力使人民民主国家回复到法西斯主义，并且把它们的领土变为反苏联斗争的桥头堡垒。美英帝国主义者及其在我国的走卒的这些计划的失败，乃是人民民主制度强大与稳固的明证。科拉罗夫与契尔文科夫号召选民投祖国阵线候选人的票，并说，这就是投和平、民主与社会主义的票，就是投保苏友谊巩固的票。人民戏院内外的会众，一起向领导保加利亚人民沿着建设社会主义基础之道路前进的保加利亚共产党热烈致敬，每当讲演人提到斯大林的名字时，会场上就响起了暴风雨般的欢呼。会毕，劳动人民举行了火炬游行。
