Brief News Items

	★ The open-hearth furnace of the Tianjin Steel Plant of the North China Steel Company completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule on the 28th of last month. The quality of the steel ingots produced, the sulfur content and phosphorus content are all below the specified standard of 0.05. The achievement of this result is mainly due to the improvement of furnace repair technology, which corrected the past shortcomings of easy damage to the furnace bottom and easy melting of the furnace roof, shortening the steel melting time from seven hours to six hours. At the same time, due to the good repair of the furnace, the number of steelmaking operations has also greatly increased. In addition, the workers' steelmaking technology is becoming more and more skilled. It only takes more than forty minutes from pouring out the molten steel to the second feeding, which is close to the standard time, which is also one of the reasons for achieving the aforementioned results.
	★ The efficiency of coal washing work in the Xiangjiang Coal Mine, a state-owned mine in Xiangtan, Hunan, has been greatly improved. Taking October as an example, the ash content of clean coal was reduced from 21.9 percent to 17 percent, and the coal content in washed slag was reduced from 20.9 percent to 5.6 percent. The man-hours required to wash one ton of coal have also been reduced from 1.99 to 1.48.
	★ All twelve iron factories in Xiamen were severely damaged by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops before liberation and were forced to close down for two months. Now, except for two that are unable to resume work for the time being due to heavy losses, the remaining ten have resumed work one after another.

    ★华北钢铁公司天津制钢厂的马丁炉，已于上月二十八日提前完成今年生产计划，所产钢锭的质量，含硫量和含磷量都在规定标准○．○五以下。这一成绩的获得，主要是由于修炉技术的改进，纠正了过去炉底易坏，炉顶易熔化的缺点，使钢料化清时间从七小时缩短为六小时。同时，由于炉子修得好，炼钢的次数也大为增加。此外，工人炼钢技术日益熟练，每炉从倾出钢水到第二次进料，只要四十多分钟，已经接近标准时间，也是取得前述成绩的原因之一。
    ★湖南湘潭公营湘江煤矿洗煤工作的效率大为提高。以十月份为例，净煤的灰粉由百分之二一．九减至百分之一七，洗碴中的含煤量由百分之二○．九减至百分之五．六。洗煤一吨所需工时，也由一．九九个减至一．四八个。
    ★厦门全市十二家铁工厂，解放前饱受蒋匪军的摧残，被迫关门已经二个月。现除二家因损失太重一时无法复工外，其余十家都已先后复工。
