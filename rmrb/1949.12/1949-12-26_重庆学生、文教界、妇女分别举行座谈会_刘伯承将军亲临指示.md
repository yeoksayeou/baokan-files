Commander Liu Bocheng gave detailed instructions on the issues of students participating in the people's revolutionary movement and studying. In his speech, Commander Liu explained the cultural and educational policies in the Common Program, hoping that students would study hard to prepare for participation in construction, and participate in social activities as much as possible without affecting their studies, combine with reality, and serve the people. The symposium for cultural and educational circles held on the 15th was attended by more than 100 people from cultural and educational circles. At the meeting, Deputy Mayor Cao Diqiu gave a specific explanation of the New Democratic cultural and educational policies, hoping that cultural and educational circles would assist in taking over cultural and educational institutions, expose secret agents, examine and eliminate the poison of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in education, and study the reform of the education system and curriculum. Zhang Ziyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, was also invited to speak, calling on cultural and educational circles to strengthen unity and participate in cultural and educational construction. The cultural and educational representatives attending the meeting spoke enthusiastically, accusing the Kuomintang bandit gang of destroying cultural and educational undertakings and persecuting and murdering progressive elements in cultural and educational circles. They also proposed reforming the education system, reviewing teaching materials, and introducing a large number of Soviet cultural construction achievements, organizing conferences to study the education system, and banning yellow books and pornographic films. The representatives also emphasized the work of stepping up learning and self-reform. At the women's symposium on the 16th, 180 representatives attended. Representatives of students and teachers proposed that they should organize to strengthen learning in the future. Women worker representatives were very excited about being promoted from their past oppressed and exploited status to the leading class of the country and attending meetings with everyone. The women worker representatives expressed their intention to step up production and actively participate in construction. Commander Liu Bocheng also attended and gave a speech, pointing out that women's work in the future should focus on participating in production, strengthening learning, and being vigilant against enemy sabotage. Finally, according to everyone's unanimous request, Lin Pinglan and fifteen others were elected, and Rao Guoying and sixteen others were hired by the Military Control Commission as preparatory committee members for the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation to establish the preparatory committee of the Chongqing Democratic Women's Federation.
