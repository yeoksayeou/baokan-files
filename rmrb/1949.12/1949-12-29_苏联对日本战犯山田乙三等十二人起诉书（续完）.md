　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 27th:

　　The intensifying preparation for bacteriological warfare against the Soviet Union.

　　In 1941, after Hitler launched a perfidious attack on the Soviet Union, the Japanese militarists, who were waiting for an opportunity to join the war against the Soviet Union, actively organized and prepared bacteriological units and their detachments in Manchuria in order to launch bacteriological warfare.

　　According to the "Kwantung Army Plan" (i.e., the plan adopted in the summer of 1941 to deploy the Japanese Kwantung Army to attack the Soviet Union), Units 731 and 100 organized officers and non-commissioned officers for special training in mastering and using bacteriological weapons.

　　Atsushi Takahashi, the former head of the Kwantung Army Veterinary Department, testified: "Since the Kwantung Army's operational plan was drafted, the headquarters of every army stationed in Manchuria has organized 'Livestock Epidemic' units. Doctors and bacterial experts sent from Unit 100 were in charge of these units. The First Operations Division of the Japanese Army General Staff was the supervisor for establishing these units. The task of the 'Livestock Epidemic' units was to prepare and launch bacteriological warfare and diversionary activities against the Soviet Union."

　　After Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union, Units 731 and 100 intensified training to master and use bacteriological weapons and systematically dispatched groups to the Soviet border to spread bacteria.

　　Defendant Kiyoshi Kawashima testified regarding Japan's intensified preparation for bacteriological warfare: "In the summer of 1941, after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, I visited General Ishii several times, once in the presence of Lieutenant Colonel Murakami and Colonel Akira Otani, who were in charge of the unit. At that time, General Ishii strongly emphasized the importance of intensifying the unit's work and read to us an order from the Japanese Chief of Staff. The Japanese Chief of Staff demanded that research on plague germs as bacteriological warfare weapons be stepped up. The order specifically emphasized the need to breed fleas in large quantities to spread the plague."

　　Toyohiko Nishi, the former head of the Education Department of Unit 731, spoke about Japan's preparations for bacteriological warfare when Hitler's Germany attacked the Soviet Union. He testified: "When Hitler's Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, the Kwantung Army stationed in Manchuria concentrated on the Soviet border. Scientific research for establishing effective tools for bacterial attacks had largely been completed by Unit 731. The further activities of this unit were to improve methods of mass-producing and spreading bacteria. Experiments proved that plague bacteria were the most effective means of attack."

　　In 1942, Units 731 and 100 conducted special reconnaissance of the Soviet border areas in preparation for bacteriological warfare. Earlier, Unit 100, on the orders of the Japanese Kwantung Army headquarters, systematically dispatched bacterial groups to the Soviet border. For the purpose of sabotage, these groups released bacteria into reservoirs on the border for several years. These facts have been proven by the testimonies of defendants Heisakura, Mitomo, and witnesses Kawashima and others.

　　In September 1944, Unit 100 held so-called exercises at the test range in the Anda station area of Unit 731, with representatives from the Kwantung Army headquarters participating, to test the effectiveness of bacteriological weapons. Witness Fukuzumi, who participated in the exercise, testified: "Regarding the search for methods of using bacteria on a large scale, special equipment and aircraft were used at special test ranges. These tests, when conducted on a large scale, were called 'exercises.' Such an 'exercise' was held at Anda station in September 1944. The target of the test was 300 pairs of cattle and sheep. The test produced good results because all the livestock became ill and died. Representatives from the Kwantung Army headquarters came by plane to observe the test."

　　The activities specially intensified by Units 731 and 100 and their detachments in preparing for bacteriological warfare against the Soviet Union had already begun as early as 1934.

　　Defendant Toyohiko Nishi testified on this point: "In May 1945, when I personally reported to General Ishii, he particularly emphasized the need to intensify bacteriological cultivation work, primarily plague bacteria. Because, in his opinion, the situation was developing and there might be a need to attack the enemy with bacteria at any time."

　　To implement this instruction, all detachments of Unit 731 intensified the large-scale capture and breeding of rodents (large rats and mice) in order to spread plague-infected fleas. To achieve this goal, special groups were established in squads and military units.

　　During the same period, experimental work was intensified, and equipment was replaced to increase the production and storage of bacteria. When asked about the production potential of the bacteriological units under his command, former Japanese Kwantung Army Commander Yamada admitted that the effectiveness of these bacteriological units was extremely great, and Unit 731 alone was sufficient to supply Japan with the weapons it needed for bacteriological warfare if necessary.

　　The swift defeat of the Japanese invaders by the Soviet Union shattered the Japanese ruling clique's sinister plan to launch bacteriological warfare.

　　The Soviet Union and its armed forces thwarted the sinister plan of the ruling clique of imperialist Japan to launch bacteriological warfare.

　　The entry of Soviet troops into Manchuria and the rapid, paralyzing strikes against the enemy quickly defeated the main force of the Japanese army, the Kwantung Army, and forced imperialist Japan to surrender unconditionally. Defendant Yamada testified: "The Soviet Union's war against Japan and the rapid penetration of Soviet troops into Manchuria deprived us of the possibility of using bacteriological weapons against the Soviet Union and other countries."

　　On the eve of surrender, in order to eliminate traces of their crimes, the Japanese ordered the destruction of all buildings, equipment, and documents of the bacteriological units and their subordinate detachments.

　　Thus, the preliminary investigation confirmed that the actual activities of the 731 and 100 bacteriological units under the command of the Japanese General Staff and the Kwantung Army Command were an integral part of the overall sinister plan of the ruling clique of imperialist Japan.

　　At the same time, the following fact has also been confirmed: In order to achieve its sinister goals, the Japanese warlords did not hesitate to commit any crime, even using living people as inhumane experimental subjects. Thousands of prisoners were exterminated because they were forcibly injected with deadly bacteria.

　　Personal Crimes of the Accused

　　Yamada Otozo Directed Preparations for Bacteriological Warfare and Encouraged Human Experimentation

　　The crimes of each defendant in this case are specifically manifested in the following facts:

　　1. Yamada Otozo, from 1944 until the Japanese army surrendered, served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Kwantung Army. He directed the preparations for bacteriological warfare by Special Units 731 and 100. During his tenure, Yamada personally and the responsible officers under him, as well as the inspectors of these special units, constantly received reports from the commanders of these units and did everything possible to keep the units in a constant state of readiness.

　　Defendant Yamada, through personal inspections and reports from the commanders of the bacteriological units, was aware of the evil experiments conducted on living humans, and he encouraged these atrocities. Therefore, Yamada is responsible for the barbaric massacre of thousands of people who died from injections of deadly bacteria.

　　Defendant Yamada, in describing his leadership role in Unit 731, said: "Because I was the Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, Unit 731 was directly under my command. Regarding all the production and use of bacteriological weapons, Unit 731 was tactically led by me. This means that if it was necessary to use bacteriological weapons against enemy forces, then this order could only be issued by me, because Unit 731 was a special unit under my command."

　　Bacteriological Unit 100 was also commanded by Defendant Yamada.

　　Ryuuji Kajitsuka Directly Directed Unit 731 in Preparing for Bacteriological Warfare

　　2. Ryuuji Kajitsuka, since taking office as Director of the Kwantung Army Medical Affairs Bureau in 1939, directly guided the work of Unit 731, which was engaged in preparing for bacteriological warfare. Ryuuji Kajitsuka was one of the founders of research into methods of using bacteriological weapons.

　　As early as 1931, Ryuuji Kajitsuka actively supported Shiro Ishii, a theorist of bacteriological warfare. At Ryuuji Kajitsuka's invitation, Shiro Ishii intensified his research into bacteriological weapons for war purposes. From 1934 to 1936, while in charge of the Medical Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Army Department, Defendant Ryuuji Kajitsuka and individual experts actively participated in the organization and staff work of Unit 731 and especially spoke highly of Ishii, who was appointed as the head of Unit 731.

　　During the interrogation, Defendant Ryuuji Kajitsuka fully admitted that he knew the entire activities of Unit 731 and its detachments—from the evil experiments on living humans to the use of bacteriological weapons.

　　Defendant Ryuuji Kajitsuka testified: "I am certain that experiments on living humans were frequently conducted in Unit 731, with the aim of finding the most effective bacteriological weapon. I know that Unit 731 applied bacteriological weapons to Chinese troops and peaceful civilians in 1941 and 1942. The military medical and health team that I led had made preparations for bacteriological warfare."

　　Ryuuji Kajitsuka denied that he personally participated in the direct practical activities of preparing for bacteriological warfare against the Soviet Union, but he has been fully exposed by the statements of Defendant Yamada, Takahashi, and the testimony of witness Kawano and others.

　　Takahashi Takaatsu Directly Led Unit 100 in Preparing for Bacteriological Warfare against the Soviet Union

　　3. Takaatsu Takahashi, from 1941 until Japan's surrender, served as the Director of the Veterinary Department of the Japanese Kwantung Army and directly led the activities of Unit 100, actively participating in the preparation for bacteriological warfare.

　　Referring to the role he played in the activities of Unit 100, Defendant Takaatsu Takahashi testified: "I directed the preparation for bacteriological warfare and bacteriological diversionary warfare against the Soviet Union." "In Unit 100, I ordered the preparation and management of the production of glanders and anthrax bacteria, cattle plague vaccine, and mottled disease bacteria, in order to use them in bacteriological warfare and bacteriological diversionary warfare against the Soviet Union."

　　Defendant Takaatsu Takahashi, who directed the work of Unit 100, often argued that bacteriological weapons were the most effective war tool.

　　Kiyoshi Kawashima Organized Large-Scale Bacterial Production and Participated in the Use of Living Humans as Experimental Subjects

　　4. Kiyoshi Kawashima, from 1941 to 1943, served as the Chief of the Production Department of Unit 731 and organized the large-scale production of bacteriological weapons. Defendant Kiyoshi Kawashima personally participated in the evil "research" extensively carried out by the unit and the "experiments" on living humans.

　　Defendant Kiyoshi Kawashima testified on this matter: "I recognized that our method of using living humans for experiments—killing them in batches with poisonous bacteria—was barbaric and a crime against humanity."

　　In 1942, Defendant Kiyoshi Kawashima participated in the work of preparing combat weapons for the Special Expeditionary Army dispatched to the Central China battlefield, in order to use bacteriological weapons in the war in Central China.

　　Toyohiko Nishi Commanded Bacterial Detachment and Participated in Experiments on Living Humans

　　5. Toyohiko Nishi, from January 1943 to 1945, served as the captain of the 673rd Detachment of Unit 731. He commanded all the work of the detachment he led and prepared the necessary materials for Unit 731 to manufacture bacteriological weapons. From July 1944, Defendant Toyohiko Nishi concurrently served as the head of the so-called training department of Unit 731 and personally participated in the evil and inhumane experiments on living humans.

　　When the Soviet Union's victory was approaching in 1945, in order to conceal the traces of his criminal acts, Defendant Toyohiko Nishi burned down all the houses and archives of the 673rd Detachment he led.

　　Tomio Karasawa Actively Organized the Manufacture of Bacteria to Supply Bacteriological Weapons to Central China

　　6. Tomio Karasawa, from 1943 to 1945, served as the Section Chief of the Production Department of Unit 731. He was an active organizer of the large-scale manufacture of bacteriological weapons. From 1940 to 1942, Defendant Karasawa participated in the work of supplying bacteria to the Special Detachment of Unit 731 in Central China, in order to use bacteriological weapons in the war. From 1943 to 1944, Karasawa directly participated in the evil experiments of using prisoners to test deadly bacteria.

　　7. Masao Otoe, from October 1943 to 1945, served as the captain of the 643rd Detachment of Unit 731, directly guiding the extensive investigation of the most effective combat bacteriological weapons and methods of mass production.

　　Defendant Otoe testified: "I knew that Unit 731 was engaged in the research and large-scale manufacture of bacteria for bacteriological warfare against the Soviet Union. In the 643rd Detachment I led, rodents and plague-carrying fleas were cultivated and sent to Unit 731, where they were used to prepare bacteriological weapons."

　　Under the leadership of Defendant Otoe, the detachment's training department systematically prepared specialists for bacteriological warfare. In 1945, in order to cover up his crimes in preparing for bacteriological warfare, Otoe destroyed all the equipment and archives of the detachment.

　　Haruji Sato Increased Bacterial Production and Trained in the Use of Bacteria

　　8. Haruji Sato, from 1941 to 1943, served as the commander of the "Nami" and "Sakae" Units, and from 1944, he served as the Chief of the Medical Affairs Department of the 5th Army (part of the Kwantung Army). He led the activities of the 643rd Detachment of Unit 731.

　　As the leader of the "Nami" and "Sakae" Units, Defendant Sato was actively engaged in the research and manufacture of bacteriological weapons. Later, as the Chief of the Medical Affairs Department of the 5th Army, Defendant Sato gave active assistance and support to the 643rd Detachment, which was manifested in increasing bacterial production and issuing special orders to the 5th Army to collect rodents for this detachment.

　　During questioning, Defendant Sato testified: "As the commander of the 'Sakae' Unit, I led the unit in researching and mass-producing bacteriological weapons. For this purpose, the Nanjing 'Sakae' Unit was equipped with powerful equipment, staffed with bacteriological experts, and manufactured large-scale deadly bacteria. Under my leadership, the training department prepared 300 bacteriologists each year for the purpose of using them in bacteriological warfare."

　　In addition to his own statements, the statements of Defendants Otoe, witnesses Kawashima, and others also confirm Sato's crimes.

　　Zensaku Hirasakura Organized Anti-Soviet Reconnaissance Work and Released Poison in the Triletschi Area

　　9. Zensaku Hirasakura, from July 1942 until Japan's surrender, was an employee of Unit 100 and played an active role in researching and mass-producing bacteriological weapons for attacking the Soviet Union.

　　From 1942 to 1944, Defendant Hirasakura led a detective team composed of Unit 100 personnel and repeatedly participated in anti-Soviet special reconnaissance work aimed at finding the most effective methods of using anti-Soviet bacteriological weapons. During the same period, with the aim of sabotage, he repeatedly released poison into reservoirs on the Soviet border, especially in the Triletschi area.

　　Katsuo Mitomo Cruelly Poisoned Living Humans and Participated in Sabotage against the Soviet Union

　　10. Katsuo Mitomo, from April 1941 to 1944, was a member of Unit 100 and played an active role in producing deadly bacteria for bacteriological warfare and anti-Soviet sabotage.

　　Mitomo personally and extremely cruelly murdered prisoners, testing certain types of bacteriological weapons on them.

　　In July and August 1942, Defendant Mitomo, as a member of the detective team of Unit 100, participated in anti-Soviet sabotage activities in the Triletschi area.

　　11. Sanzo Kikuchi, from April 1943 to August 1945, served as a soldier in the 643rd Detachment of Unit 731. From February 1944 to February 1945, Kikuchi was a staff member of the first division laboratory of the detachment and engaged in the cultivation of typhoid and dysentery bacteria, helping with the research of bacteriological weapons. Kikuchi was re-trained in June 1945 at the Unit 731 (bacteriological weapon personnel were trained in this unit) bacteriological training course.

　　This is confirmed by Kikuchi's own confession and the testimony of witnesses Saito, Okada Mizushige, and others.

　　12. Juji Kurushima, after receiving special training in October 1944, served in the 162nd Detachment of Unit 731 and served as a nurse and laboratory worker in the first division of the detachment, participating in the cultivation of cholera, typhoid, and other bacteria. Kurushima confessed that he knew that Unit 731 was preparing for bacteriological warfare and was manufacturing bacteriological weapons.

　　Of the defendants on trial, Yamada Otozo, Takahashi Takaatsu, Karasawa Tomio, Kawashima Kiyoshi, Otoe Masao, Nishi Toyohiko, Hirasakura Zensaku, Sato Haruji, Mitomo Katsuo, Kikuchi Sanzo, and Kurushima Juji, eleven pleaded guilty to all the charges brought against them. Defendant Ryuuji Kajitsuka admitted to some of the charges.

　　In addition to personal confessions, the crimes of the defendants in this case have been proven by the testimony of many witnesses, written evidence, and the research conclusions of the forensic expert committee.

　　The Criminal Activities of the Twelve People Should Be Tried by Military Law

　　苏联对日本战犯山田乙三等十二人起诉书（续完）
  　加紧准备对苏的细菌战
    一九四一年，在希特勒对苏发动背信弃义的进攻之后，那些正在等待时机来参加对苏战争的日本军国主义者，积极地在满洲组织和准备细菌部队及其支队，以便发动细菌战争。
    按照“关东军计划”（即一九四一年夏季采取的部署日本关东军以进攻苏联的计划），七三一部队和一百号部队组织了军官和下级军官，掌握和使用细菌武器的特殊训练。
    前关东军兽医部门负责人高桥笃供称：“自拟制了关东军的作战计划之后，驻在满洲的每一支军队的总部，都组织了‘牲畜流行病’部队。从一百号部队派来的医生和细菌专家，就是这些部队的负责人。日本陆军参谋本部的第一作战处，就是建立这些部队的主管人。‘牲畜流行病’部队的任务，是准备和发动对苏的细细菌战和牵制活动”。
    希特勒进攻苏联之后，七三一和一百号部队加紧训练掌握和使用细菌武器，并有系统地派遣小组至苏联边境散放细菌。
    被告川岛清就日本加紧准备细菌战一事供称：“一九四一年夏季在德苏战争发之后，我曾数度访问石井将军，有一次是有该部的负责人村上中校和大谷明上校在场的。那时石井将军力言加紧部队工作的重要性，并对我们宣读日本参谋总长的命令。日本参谋总长要求加紧研究作为细菌战武器的鼠疫菌。该项命令特别强调有必要大量饲养跳蚤，以散布鼠疫。”
    被告前七三一部队教育处长西丰彦谈日本准备在希特勒德国进攻苏联时进行细菌战的情形，他供称：“希特勒德国在一九四一年进攻苏联，驻在满洲的关东军集中于苏联边境，为建立细菌袭击的有效工具的科学研究，大体已由七三一部队所完成。这个部队的进一步活动，是改进大量生产细菌和散布细菌的方法。经实验证明：鼠疫细菌是最有效的进攻手段。”
    七三一及一百号部队曾于一九四二年特别侦察苏联边境地区，以准备进行细菌战争。更早以前，一百号部队奉日本关东军总部命令，有系统地派遣了细菌小组至苏联边境。这种小组若干年来为阴谋破坏起见，散放细菌于边境的蓄水池。这些事实业已为被告平樱、三友，和证人川岛及其他人的供词所证明。
    一百号部队于一九四四年九月间，在七三一部队于安达站地区的靶场，在关东军总部的代表们参加之下，举行了所谓演习，试验细菌武器的效果。参加此次演习的、证人福住作证称：“关于寻觅大量使用细菌的方法，是使用特别器械和飞机在特别靶场进行的。这种试验如在大规模进行时，就叫作‘演习’。这种‘演习’于一九四四年九月间在安达站举行过。试验是以三百双牛羊为目标。这种试验产生了良好的效果，因为所有牲畜都染上了病，死了。关东军总部的代表们曾坐飞机前来参观这个试验。”
    七三一部队、一百号部队、及其支队在准备对苏联的细菌战争上所特别加紧进行的活动，早在一九五四年即已开始。
    被告西丰彦曾就此点供称：“一九四五年五月，在我亲自向石井将军作报告时，他特别强调加紧进行细菌培养工作的需要。首先是鼠疫细菌。因为据他看来，情势在发展着，随时都可能有以细菌袭击敌人的需要。”
    为执行这种训令，七三一部队的所有支队，加紧进行大规模捕捉与饲养啮齿动物（大老鼠小耗子（的工作，以便散布染有鼠疫的跳蚤。为了达到这个目的，在分队和军事部队中都成立了特别小组。
    在同一时期，实验的工作加紧了，装备更换了，以便增加细菌的生产量和储存量。前日本关东军总司令山田于被问及在他指挥下的细菌部队的生产潜能时，他承认：这种细菌部队的效能是极为巨大的，仅七三一部队就足以在必要时供应日本在细菌战中所需的武器。
    苏联迅速击败日寇，粉碎了日本统治集团发动细菌战争的罪恶计划。
    苏联及其武装部队挫败了帝国主义日本的统治集团发动细菌战争的罪恶计划。
    苏联部队进入满洲境予敌人以迅速的使其瘫痪的打击，在短期内就把日军主力部队关东军击溃了，同时迫使帝国主义日本无条件投降。被告山田供称：“苏联对日作战和苏军迅速深入满洲，使我们用细菌武器与苏联和其他国家作战的可能性被剥夺了。”
    在投降的前夕，为了消灭罪迹，日本就命令他们把细菌部队及所属支队的建筑、装备和文件，统统销毁了。
    这样，初步的调查就证实了日本参谋本部和关东军司令指挥之下的七三一和一百号细菌部队的实际活动，是帝国主义日本统治集团的罪恶阴谋总计划中的一个组成部分。
    同时下一事实亦已证实：日本军阀为了达成其罪恶的目的，不惜进行任何罪行，甚至以活人作此种不人道的实验品，数千囚犯因为强迫注射致命的细菌而被消灭。
    被告个人的罪行
    山田乙三指挥准备细菌战争鼓励用活人作实验
    在本案中每一个被告的罪行，具体表现在下列事实上：
    一、山田乙三，自一九四四年以迄日军投降为止，任日本关东军总司令，他指导七三一和第一百号特种部队准备细菌战争。在任内，山田个人和其属下负责军官及该特种部队的视察人员，曾不断接到该部队各指挥官的报告，并尽一切方法使该部队经常处于准备状态中。
    被告山田由于亲自视察和接到细菌部队指挥官的报告，他是知道以活人作此种罪恶实验的，他并鼓励这种暴行。因此山田是要对因注射致命的细菌而死的数以千计的人民的野蛮屠杀负责的。
    被告山田于叙述他对七三一部队所起的领导作用时说：“因为我是关东军总司令，所以七三一部队直接由我指挥。关于一切细菌武器的生产和使用，七三一部队在战术上都是由我领导。这就意味着：假如需要使用细菌武器来对付敌军的话，那么，这个命令就只能由我发出，因为七三一部队是由我指挥的特种部队。”
    一百号细菌部队也是由被告山田指挥的。
    ＠冢龙二直接指导七三一部队从事准备细菌战争
    二、＠冢龙二，自从一九三九年充任关东军医务局局长以来，便直接指导七三一部队的工作，就是从事于准备细菌战争。＠冢是研究运用细菌武器之方法的一个创始人。
    还在一九三一年，＠冢便积极支持一个细菌战争理论家石井四郎，石井并应＠冢之邀，而为战争目的加紧研究细菌武器的。一九三四至三六年，在主持日本陆军部医务局的时候，被告＠冢和个别专家积极参与七三一部队的组织与参谋工作，并特别为石井说项，使被任命为七三一部队的首长。
    在审问时，被告＠冢完全承认他晓得七三一部队及其各支队的全盘活动——从以活人作罪恶的实验以至使用细菌武器。
    被告＠冢龙二供称：“我确知用活人做试验是时常在七三一部队中进行，其目的在找出一种最有效的细菌武器。我知道七三一部队在一九四一和一九四二年曾将细菌武器施之于中国军队与和平的老百姓。我所领导的军队医疗卫生队已经为细菌战争做好准备。”
    ＠冢龙二否认他本人曾参加准备对苏联细菌战的直接实际活动，但是他已完全为被告山田、高桥之供状和证人川野等人的供词所暴露出来了。
    高桥高笃直接领导一百号部队准备对苏联细菌战争
    三、高桥高笃，自一九四一年至日本投降时任日本关东军兽医处处长，并直接领导第一百号部队的活动，曾积极参加细菌战争之准备工作。
    谈及他在第一百号部队活动中所起的作用时，被告高桥高笃供称：“我指导细菌战争和对苏联细菌牵制战的准备工作。”“我在第一百号部队中，命令准备并管理制造鼻疽和炭疽热细菌，牛瘟疫苗和斑驳病的细菌，以便把它们用于细菌战争和对苏联细菌牵制战。”
    指导一百号部队工作的被告高桥高笃，经常力言细菌武器是一种最有效的战争工具。
    川岛清组织大规模生产细菌参加用活人作试验品
    四、川岛清，自一九四一年至一九四三年任七三一部队生产处处长，并组织大规模的细菌武器的生产。被告川岛清亲身参加该部队所大肆进行的罪恶的“研究”和在活人身上的“试验”。
    被告川岛清对此问题供称：“我认识到我们用活人做试验的方法——整批地把他们用毒菌杀死——是野蛮的，并且是违反人道的罪恶。”
    被告川岛清在一九四二年参加了为派往中国华中战场的特别派遣军准备作战武器的工作，以便在华中战争中使用细菌武器。
    西丰彦指挥细菌支队参加活人试验
    五、西丰彦，自一九四三年一月至一九四五年任七三一部队六七三支队队长，他指挥他所率领的支队的全部工作，为七三一部队准备制造细菌武器的必要材料。自一九四四年七月起，被告西丰彦兼任七三一部队的所谓教练处处长，曾亲身参加用活人作罪恶的惨无人道的试验。
