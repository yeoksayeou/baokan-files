　　Stalin—Creator of Friendship Among Nations
    Yuegube·Kaolas
    Translated by Zhang Xingshi
    The greatest genius of mankind—Lenin, and his great successor—Stalin, are the creators and inspirers of the new socialist era; this era is an unprecedented era, an era that outstanding people have always dreamed of, an era that guides the world's humanity towards happiness.
    Stalin, the organizer of the new socialist society, has pioneered new paths in all areas of life. He has demonstrated endless energy and consistently diligent working ability. The socialist construction of the Soviet Union, Soviet science, literature, and art, have all been led by Stalin's genius onto the road of continuous improvement.
    Stalin's profound knowledge and observation of all life phenomena are astonishing. He is the greatest dialectical materialist theorist who combines theory with practical problems. He is a master of the most advanced science, a profound strategist, a visionary politician, a great commander, an outstanding diplomat, and an organizer. Stalin is the concrete embodiment of the struggle for peace, for happiness, for freedom, for progress, for the victory of true culture to liberate mankind from the slavery and oppression of the old world.
    Stalin—this is the giant who leads progressive humanity. His far-reaching gaze penetrates the destiny of all nations. His all-encompassing genius as a leader and mentor allows him to find a powerful lever in various life phenomena and problems, and the struggles and actions of millions of people are directed by this lever.
    Friendship among nations is one of these levers. Stalin and Lenin jointly formulated the program of the working class on the national question, which served as the foundation for the great friendship of the Soviet nations. As early as 1904, in his outstanding essay "How Does Social Democracy Understand the National Question," Stalin discussed and explained the Bolshevik Party's national program. He pointed out that the proletariat should have its own program on the national question, which is different from the bourgeois program, just as the proletariat itself is different from this class that is opposed to it. In 1913, Stalin's work "Marxism and the National Question" was published. This book received high praise from Lenin. This work is the Bolshevik theoretical and programmatic declaration on the national question, a relentless blow to the opportunist views of the Second International on this issue. This created the Leninist-Stalinist program of the proletariat on the national question, which firmly rejects all forms of coercion in national relations; recognizes the equality and sovereignty of all nations in determining their own destiny; and recognizes that only on the basis of voluntary cooperation and after the overthrow of capitalist rule, the solid union of all nations is possible. During the period of preparation for the Great October Revolution, Stalin further discussed and developed the Bolshevik Party's national program, explaining the foundations of the Bolshevik Party's national policy to the working masses of the oppressed nations in Russia, thereby promoting their unity around the Russian proletariat.
    The day after the October armed uprising, Stalin served as the People's Commissar for Nationalities Affairs. He and Lenin together led the establishment of the national republics and formulated policies to help those previously oppressed nations. He drafted the declaration for the establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922. He and Lenin were the creators of the Soviet Union, establishing a multi-ethnic socialist country. This is the most solid country in the world, in which true friendship among nations has flourished.

　　斯大林——各民族间友谊的创造者
    约古柏·考拉斯
    张醒石译
    人类底最伟大的天才——列宁，及其伟大事业的继承者——斯大林，是新的社会主义时代底创造者和鼓舞者；这个时代是从来未曾有过的时代，是优秀的人们一直幻想着的时代，是引导世界人类走向幸福的时代。
    新的社会主义社会的组织者斯大林，在生活底一切领域中开拓了新的道路。他表现了无尽的精力和始终不卷的工作能力。苏联的社会主义建设，苏维埃科学、文学、艺术，都由斯大林天才领导而走上不断提高的道路。
    斯大林对于一切生活现象认识和观察之渊博是惊人的。他是一个把理论与实际问题结合在一起的，最伟大的辩证唯物主义的理论家。他是最先进科学的巨匠，精深的战略家，远见的政治家，伟大的统帅，卓越的外交家和组织者。斯大林是争取和平、争取幸福、争取自由、争取进步、争取人类摆脱旧世界奴役与压迫的真正文化之胜利的具体形象。
    斯大林——这是领导进步人类的巨人。他的深远的目光洞烛了各民族的命运。他的领袖和导师底无所不包的天才，使他在各种各样生活现象及问题上可以找到一个有力的杠杆，千百万群众的斗争和行动靠这个杠杆而得到方向。
    各民族之间的友谊是这些杠杆之一。斯大林与列宁共同制定了工人阶级在民族问题上的纲领，这个纲领便作了苏维埃各民族伟大友谊之基础。早于一九○四年，斯大林在他的卓越论文“社会民主党怎样了解民族问题”一文中，就论述并解释了布尔什维克党的民族纲领。他指出：无产阶级在民族问题上应该有它自己的纲领，这个纲领既和资产阶级的纲领有别，正如无产阶级本身是和这个与他对立的阶级不同一样。一九一三年斯大林的著作“马克思主义与民族问题”出版了。这本书得到了列宁极高的评价。这部著作乃是布尔什维主义对民族问题的理论和纲领式宣言，是对第二国际在这个问题上的机会主义观点的一个无情打击。这就造成了无产阶级对民族问题底列宁——斯大林的纲领，这个纲领是坚决否定民族关系上的一切强制形式；承认各民族在决定本身命运中的平等和主权；承认，只有在自愿合作的基础上和推翻资本家政权以后，各民族的坚固联合方有可能。在准备伟大的十月革命的时期，斯大林进一步论述并发展了布尔什维克党底民族纲领，向俄国被压迫民族劳动群众解释了布尔什维克党民族政策的基础，从而推动他们团结于俄国无产阶级的周围。
    十月武装起义以后的第二日，斯大林任民族事务人民委员。他和列宁在一起，领导了各民族共和国的建立，制定了帮助那些以前被压迫各民族的政策。他起草了一九二二年苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（苏联）成立的宣言。他和列宁一起，是苏联的创造者，建立了多民族的社会主义国家。这是世界上最巩固的国家，在它里面发荣滋长了各民族间的真正友谊。
