Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government convened the first conference of education section chiefs from special districts and counties from November 6th to 25th. The conference reviewed the province's primary education work over the past year and formulated an implementation plan for universal education in the future. After a year of restoration and rectification, primary education in Shanxi Province has initially implemented the guidelines decided by the former North China People's Government's May Primary Education Conference and has achieved considerable success. There are now 16,704 junior primary schools and 425 senior primary schools in the province, with more than 860,300 primary school students. The tendency in old liberated areas' primary education to not focus on cultural learning has been largely corrected. In newly liberated areas, the reactionary education system and ideological control of the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs were rapidly destroyed. New textbooks were adopted, and methods such as rotation training and intensive training were adopted to transform a large number of old teachers. However, due to Shanxi's long-term war environment, primary schools are mostly run in a decentralized manner. As a result, the development of primary schools in the province is uneven. Many areas lack a formal education system. Teachers have low skill levels and high turnover. The cultivation of children's health education and concepts such as love of country and discipline are generally neglected. On the other hand, the idea of old-fashioned formal education is still retained. There is a lack of democratic management in children's lives, and the ingrained habits of corporal punishment and disguised corporal punishment have not been completely eliminated. This has become an obstacle to further improvement of primary education in the province. Currently, more than half of the province's 1,835,000 school-age children are still out of school. On average, there is only one primary school for every 631 children in the province. Two-thirds of the existing schools are not formal enough, and the quality of teachers and education administrators is not high, and the quantity is even more lacking.
    The conference discussed and formulated an education plan to enroll all school-age children within three to five years and methods to improve teaching. At the same time, based on specific conditions, it resolved issues such as primary school leadership, teachers, funding, school buildings, and textbooks. The meeting decided that each special district and county should strengthen the supervision system, and each district should establish a joint principal system. Vocational teachers should strengthen their studies and participate in rotation training separately. Each special district and county should run normal schools well, train old intellectuals, and cultivate teachers. Textbooks should be reprinted in large quantities, and unified funding expenditure standards should be implemented. In addition, where conditions permit, the establishment of seasonal or mobile primary schools should be encouraged, and a two-part system or the opening of early, noon, and evening classes should be implemented to accommodate more children in school.

　　山西召开教育科长会议
  　订普及教育实施计划
    争取三五年内使全部学童入学
    【新华社太原十日电】山西省人民政府十一月六日到二十五日间召开第一届专署、县教育科长会议，检查了全省一年来的小学教育工作，并制订了今后普及教育实施计划。山西省的小学教育经过一年来的恢复和整顿，已经初步贯彻了前华北人民政府五月小学教育会议所决定的方针，获得不少成绩。全省现在共有初级小学一万六千七百零四座，高级小学四百二十五座，小学生八十六万零三百多人。老区小学教育中不以文化学习为主的偏向，大体已经纠正；新区则迅速摧毁了蒋、阎匪帮的反动教育体系和思想统治，采用了新课本，并采取轮训、集训等方法，改造了大批旧教员。但是，由于山西长期处于战争环境下，小学多是分散办理的，因而全省小学的发展也不平衡，不少地区缺乏正规学制，教员水平低而且流动性大，对于儿童的卫生健康教育和爱国家、守纪律等观念的培养，一般地是忽视的。另一方面，还保留有旧型正规化教育的思想，对儿童生活缺少民主管理，体罚和变相体罚的积习仍未彻底消除。这就成为全省小学教育进一步提高的障碍。现在全省一百八十三万五千多个学龄儿童中，还有一半以上失学，全省平均每六百三十一个儿童中才有一座小学。已有的学校中三分之二还不够正规，教师和教育行政人员的质量不高，数量更大感缺乏。
    这次会议讨论并制订了三年到五年内使学龄儿童全数入学的教育计划和改进教导工作等办法，同时根据具体情况，解决了小学的领导、师资、经费、校舍、课本等问题。会议决定各专区、县加强督学制，各区建立联合校长制；职教员加强学习并分别参加轮训，各专署、县办好师范学校，训练旧知识分子，培养师资；大量翻印课本并统一经费开支标准。此外，在条件许可下，提倡建立季节性的或巡回的小学，实行二部制或开设早、午、晚班，以收容更多儿童入学。
