　　Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 Furnace
　　Breaking Old Iron Smelting Quotas, Daily Output of 330 Tons
    Under the guidance of Soviet engineers, and with the efforts of administration, the trade union, and Party and Youth League members, workers' unparalleled work enthusiasm has created this amazing new record.
    [Beijing News] The No. 1 blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has created an amazing new production record, breaking the old quota and maximum iron smelting volume of the furnace for more than ten years. The total daily iron production reached 331 tons on the 26th of this month. The old production quota for the blast furnace was 250 tons. During the period of enemy伪(puppet regimes) and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the maximum daily output was only 180 tons; after liberation, the average daily output was about 150 tons. Recently, the Soviet engineer Zhiminotov, hired by the factory, conducted several inspections of the furnace and believed that the furnace's output could reach more than 300 tons. The inability to increase production during the enemy伪 and Kuomintang periods was due to the enemy not allowing workers to understand technology, the lack of workers' production enthusiasm, and the insufficient wind power and impure raw materials of the furnace. As long as these shortcomings are overcome and workers' production enthusiasm is brought into play, output will definitely increase. On the 18th of this month, the factory received instructions from the North China Iron and Steel Corporation, requiring the factory to create a new record before the closing of the National Iron and Steel Conference. When this arduous production task was put forward, the entire factory immediately became tense. The administration, the trade union, the General Party Branch of the CCP, and the Youth League branch held separate meetings to discuss how to accomplish this task. On the 19th, various preparatory work began immediately: The iron smelting plant first systematically inspected the machines in the entire plant, and implemented the overhaul of the No. 3 blower and the No. 2 boiler room to strengthen the wind power of the No. 1 blast furnace; the power plant also assisted in overhauling the boiler room and switchboard, and completed the waterway of the water pool overnight; other factories, such as the coking plant, the iron foundry, the machine factory, and the transportation section, also worked intensively to coordinate. Three days later (i.e., on the 22nd of this month), the overhaul was completed, and trial operation of the furnace began. Output increased day by day. On the 25th, output had reached 276.5 tons, and on the 26th, it exceeded the task and reached 331 tons.
    During the overhaul process, the military representative, the factory director, and every staff member made great efforts, and the workers showed a high degree of work enthusiasm. All employees of the mobile section of the iron smelting plant worked continuously for 24 hours twice. Foreman Zhang Jichao did not sleep all night. Everyone advised him to go to sleep, but he was still very uneasy after returning, so he came back and continued to work; worker Wei Liankui burned his foot but struggled to go to work, and was only sent back at the factory gate. The workers' sense of responsibility and awareness fully demonstrated their spirit of being masters of their own affairs. This new record broke the conservative ideas of the factory employees. Before the new production record was created, many workers were worried that increasing production in this way would shorten the life of the blast furnace. After the explanation by Soviet engineer Zhiminotov and this achievement, the workers' thinking was cleared. This new production record is absolutely impossible for the enemy伪 and the Kuomintang reactionaries to dream of.

　　石景山炼铁厂一号炉
　　突破炼铁旧定额　日产三百三十吨
    苏联工程师的指导，行政、工会、党团员的努力，工人无比的工作热忱，创造了这惊人的新纪录。
    【北京讯】石景山钢铁厂炼铁厂第一号炼铁炉创造了惊人的生产新纪录，突破了该炉十多年来的旧定额和最高熔铁量，每日产铁总量已于本月二十六日达到了三百三十一吨。该炼铁炉的产量旧定额是二百五十吨。敌伪和国民党反动统治时期最高产量每日仅达一百八十吨；解放后的产量平均每日约一百五十吨。最近，该厂所聘请的苏联工程师日米诺托夫对该炉进行了多次的检查，认为该炉是产量可能达到三百吨以上，敌伪和国民党时期的产量不能提高，是由于敌人不许工人懂得技术，工人的生产积极性没有发挥，和该炉机器的风力不够、加料不纯等原因造成。只要克服这些缺点，发挥工人的生产积极性，产量一定能够提高。该厂在本月十八日接到了华北钢铁公司的指示，要求该厂在全国钢铁会议闭幕前，创出新纪录来。当这是艰巨的生产任务提出以后，全厂顿时紧张起来，行政、工会和中共总支部、青年团支部都分别开会，讨论怎样来完成这一任务。在十九日立即开工进行各种准备工作：炼铁厂首先有计划地进行全厂机器的检查，实行检修三号送风机和二号锅炉房，以加强一号炼铁炉的风力；动力厂也协助检修锅炉房及配电盘，并在一夜中突击完成通水池的水道；其他各厂，如炼焦厂、铸铁厂、机器厂、运输课等也都紧张的配合工作。在三天以后（即本月二十二日），检修完毕，开始试车开炉，产量逐日增加，二十五日产量已达到二百七十六点五吨，二十六日已超过了任务，达到三百三十一吨。
    检修过程中，军代表、厂长以及每个工作人员，都尽了极大努力，工人更发挥了高度的工作热忱，炼铁厂机动课的全体员工曾有两次连续工作了二十四小时。领班张纪樵一夜未睡，大家劝他去睡觉，他回去后，仍很不安，结果又回来接着干；工人魏连奎脚烫伤了仍挣扎上班，走到厂子大门才又被送回去。工人们的责任心与觉悟程度，充分表现了他们当家作主人的精神。由于这一新纪录，打破了该厂员工的保守观念，在新的生产纪录未创造出来以前，许多工人都很担心这样增加产量会缩短炼铁炉的寿命，经过苏联工程师日米诺托夫的解释和这次的成绩，工人们才打通了思想，这个产量的新纪录绝不是敌伪及国民党反动派所能梦想得到的。
