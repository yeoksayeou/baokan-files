Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th: According to a report from the Telecommunications Agency in London: The rise in British prices has become increasingly significant. Recent figures show that in the three months since the devaluation of the pound, the wholesale price index for food has risen by 6.3 percent, non-ferrous metals by 17.2 percent, cotton by 9 percent, wool by more than 14 percent, and other textiles by more than 9 percent. Chemical products and oils have risen by more than 4 percent. Even the Ministry of Labour's price index acknowledges that the cost of living has risen by 12 percent in the past two years. London authorities now admit that the "buying spree" in October was due to widespread fear of scarcity and rising prices, and they also admit that the impact of the devaluation of the pound on the living standards of the British people has not yet fully unfolded.

In November, the number of unemployed in Britain increased again. According to official figures from the Ministry of Labour, the total number of unemployed is now 323,600, an increase of more than 23,000 compared to October. The actual number of unemployed is likely to be much higher than this official figure.

British workers are launching a struggle to increase wages, and an increasing number of trade unions are opposing the wage freeze policy implemented by the right-wing leaders of the Trade Union Congress. According to a TASS report citing the Workers' Daily: The Executive Committee of the Electrical Workers' Union has rejected the wage freeze policy. The National Union of Boot and Shoe Makers' Committee has reiterated its decision to strive for a wage system based on the price index. Leaders of another major organization—the Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen—have also rejected the wage freeze policy.

　　英物价续涨失业增加工人正展开增资斗争
    【新华社北京二十五日电】据电通社伦敦讯：英国的物价上涨已越来越显著。最近发表的数字表明：自英镑眨值后三个月来，食品批发价格指数已上涨百分之六点三，非铁金属上涨百分之十七点二，棉花上涨百分之九，羊毛上涨百分之十四以上，其他纺织品上涨百分之九以上。化学产品及油类上涨百分之四以上。甚至劳工部的物价指数，也承认两年来生活费已上涨百分之十二。伦敦当局现在承认：十月份里的“购买热”是由于广泛发展的对匮乏与物价上涨的恐俱之故，他们同时承认：英镑眨值对英国人民生活水平的影响尚未完全展开。
    十一月份，英国失业人数又复增加。根据劳工部的官方数字，失业总数现为三十二万三千六百人，较十月份增二万三千人以上。而实际失业的人数，当大大超过这一官方数字。
    英国工人正展开争取提高工资的斗争，反对职工大会右翼领袖执行的冻结工资政策的工会正日益增多。据塔斯社讯引工人日报报道：电力工人工会执行委员会，已否了冻结工资的政策。全国靴鞋匠工会委员会重申他们的决定，即争取以物价指数为基础的工资制度。另一大会——工程及造船制图者协会的领袖们，亦已否决了工资冻结政策。
