　　Beijing's Youxin and Three Other Soap Manufacturers
　　Achieve Profits Through Joint Production
　　Achieving Low Costs, High Quality, and Good Sales
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] Since Youxin, Lizhong, Xinchang, and Dahua, four soap factories in Beijing, implemented joint operations on August 20th, although only two months have passed, production has seen significant development. The "Beijing" brand soap produced has basically achieved cost reduction and quality improvement, resulting in brisk sales and the ability to sell as far as Suiyuan Province and other places. In November, traditionally a slow month, most of the 240+ soap factories in the city lost money (mainly due to high costs and low sales). Several well-known factories only managed to barely break even, while the joint venture earned a profit of over 100 boxes of soap.
　　Before the liberation of Beijing, there were fewer than 200 soap and alkali manufacturers in the city. During the early stages of liberation in March and April this year, the number suddenly increased to 600. The reason was that soap-making technology and equipment were relatively simple, and many private capitalists invested in this type of production, leading to blind production and a relative surplus of finished products. Many manufacturers competed with each other, even resorting to adulteration. Some factories' products had a soap content of only 20%, greatly affecting sales, and many manufacturers were gradually eliminated. Currently, there are still over 240 soap and alkali manufacturers in the city, most of which are operating independently, wasting manpower, and making it impossible to reduce costs. After the four factories jointly operated, the reduction in staff and expenses, and the expansion of capital, ensured a certain quality and specifications for the finished products. Therefore, costs were reduced, quality was improved, and sales increased.

　　京市又新等四家造胰业
  　联营生产获利
  　做到成本低质量高销路好
    【本报讯】京市又新、利中、信昌、大华等四家造胰工厂自八月二十日实行联营后，虽仅两个多月，但生产已获显著发展，出产“北京”牌肥皂基本上已作到减低成本、提高质量，因之销路畅旺，并能远销至绥远省等地。在十一月份的淡月，全市二百四十多家造胰厂大部赔了钱（主要原因是成本高、销货少），几家有名的工厂也只作到勉强维持，而联营社却盈余肥皂一百多箱。
    北京解放前，全市造胰制碱业不到二百家。在今年三、四月间解放初期突增至六百家。其原因是造胰技术和设备比较简单，许多私人资本多投向此种生产，致发生盲目生产成品相对过剩现象。许多厂家彼此竞销，甚至争相掺假，某些厂子的出品含皂量仅百分之二十，大大影响了销路，许多厂家即逐渐被淘汰。到现在，全市造胰制碱业仍有二百四十多家，其中大部分都是分散经营，人力浪费，以致成本无法降低。该四家工厂联合经营后，由于职员和开支的减少，资金的扩大，保证了成品一定的质量和规格。因之，成本降低，质量提高，销路增加。
