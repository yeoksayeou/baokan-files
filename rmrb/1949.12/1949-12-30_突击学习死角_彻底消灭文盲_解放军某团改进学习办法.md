　　Eliminating Illiteracy by Concentrated Study of the "Blind Spots"
　  A Certain Regiment of the People's Liberation Army Improves Study Methods
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] In order to strengthen cultural studies and thoroughly eliminate illiteracy, a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army of the North China Military Region recently held a cultural instructor conference for the entire regiment. They reviewed the past study situation and decided to adopt new methods to improve the studies of some comrades who were lagging behind. According to statistics, the regiment still had 228 people who knew less than 30 characters. In the third battalion, 29 people knew less than 10 characters, and some could not even write their own names. The reasons for the uneven development of study were reviewed as follows: First, the mobilization for study was not thorough and widespread enough. Some units were satisfied with the high general enthusiasm for study in the troops and neglected to help and educate individual personnel, causing some people to still have ideological obstacles and not participate in study. Second, there were problems with the teaching methods. Some instructors did not proceed from the overall situation and only took care of the few comrades who had a better foundation in learning; sometimes they spoke too quickly, and lacked individual help for a few older comrades with poor memory, and even showed an impatient attitude towards teaching. In addition, some comrades were concerned about saving face and did not ask questions if they did not learn, thus causing the laggards to fail to catch up. Third, the organization of study for support personnel was not strict enough. The work was unplanned, and the work time and study time were not well separated, causing some support personnel to use the excuse of not having time to avoid study, and in some units, most of those who knew few or no characters were support personnel. Based on the above situation, after discussion by the cultural instructors of the entire regiment, it was decided to implement the following four measures in the future: (1) Concentrate on eliminating the "blind spots" in learning, and adopt various ways to help and encourage and praise individuals to stimulate their interest in learning. (2) Using the company as a unit, those who know less than 30 characters are grouped separately (if there are many people, each company can be divided into several groups), and special and careful teaching methods are adopted to guide, enlighten, and repeatedly practice. This allows the entire group to gradually improve at the same level; and with fewer people, it is quieter, everyone pays attention to listening, and it is easier to remember. (3) Strictly organize support personnel. The cooking squad should unify work and study into several groups. During class, one or two groups can be drawn out to study, and the rest take on all the work, rotating in turn; and launch competitions between groups. (4) Strictly enforce the make-up class system and select special personnel to conduct make-up classes for those who are absent every day.

　　突击学习死角  彻底消灭文盲
　  解放军某团改进学习办法
    【本报讯】人民解放军华北军区某团为加强文化学习，达到彻底消灭文盲的目的，于日前召开全团文化教员会议，检讨了过去学习情况，并决定采取新的办法，搞好一部分学习较差的同志的学习。据统计，该团还有二百二十八人识字在三十个以下，第三营识字不上十个的还有二十九人，其中还有连名字都不会写的。检讨学习发展不平衡的原因：第一，是学习动员还不够深入普遍，有些单位看到部队一般学习情绪很高就满足了，忽视对个别人员的帮助教育，致使某些人仍存在着思想障碍，不参加学习。第二，教学方式有毛病，有的教员不从全面情况出发，只照顾少数学习较有基础的同志；有时讲得太快，对少数年龄较大、记忆力差的同志缺乏个别的帮助，甚至表现不耐烦教人的态度；加上一部分同志爱面子，学不会也不再问，因此使落后的老赶不上。第三，对杂务人员的学习组织不严密，工作没计划、工作时间和学习时间没有好好分开，致使一部分杂务人员借口没时间不学习，有些单位识字少的或不识字的大部是杂务人员。根据以上情况，经全团文化教员讨论后，决定今后实行四项办法：（一）突击消灭学习中的“死角”，采取多方帮助，多鼓励表扬的方式，启发个别学习落后同志的学习兴趣。（二）以连为单位，把识字不足三十个的人单独划组（人多时每连可分作数组），采取特别细心的教学方法，诱导启发，反复练习。这样使全组在同一水平上逐步提高；而且人数少，比较清静，大家都注意听，便于记住。（三）严密组织杂务人员。炊事班工作学习都统一编成数个小组，上课时可抽出一、两组去学习，其余的担任所有工作，逐次轮流；并发动组与组间展开竞赛。（四）严格补课制度，选出专人每天给缺课人员进行补课。
