Relying on Workers to Improve Management
  North China Agricultural Machinery Plant Increases Production
    Over 3,000 Agricultural Machines of Various Types Manufactured in Nine Months
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Since its opening after liberation, the North China Agricultural Machinery Plant has achieved remarkable results after nine months of arduous operation. Compared with the time of liberation, the number of workers has increased eightfold, and nearly 30 types of agricultural machinery have been produced, totaling more than 3,000 units. The following are some management experiences of the plant that are worth introducing, which have enabled it to develop so rapidly.
    Learning from the Experience of the Soviet Union and Northeast China; Clearly Establishing the Enterprise's Management Thought
    I. Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and Northeast China. The plant frequently studied more than ten newspapers from Northeast China, Dalian, Shijiazhuang, and other places, discussed Dalian's experience on "Learning from the Soviet Union's Scientific Industrial Management System," and the Northeast Bureau's instructions on "Implementing the Economic Accounting System." Combining these with the plant's situation at the time, it clearly stipulated and implemented the following policies and principles:
    (1) Resolutely grasp the policy of "starting from scratch, growing from small to large, and developing from handicraft to mechanization" step by step, and struggled against the high-mindedness of some technical cadres; increase workers based on actual needs, and never pursue numbers.
    (2) Clearly establish the enterprise's management thought from the beginning, and oppose the negative view that "it is necessary to lose money first when restoring production." They first undertook the task of manufacturing seven machines such as pulping and papermaking machines for the Beijing People's Paper Mill, and obtained nearly one million catties of millet. Then they added necessary equipment, tools, and some workshops, laying a material foundation for manufacturing agricultural machinery.
    (3) Implement the policy of "everything serving production," with more than 90% of the funds and more than 80% of the personnel used for direct production.
    (4) In terms of workers' welfare, the principle of "only with the development of production can life be improved" was implemented. At the beginning, some workers made welfare demands, which could not be met, so everyone was explained clearly. After the profit was made from manufacturing papermaking machines, a portion was voluntarily taken out to establish the most necessary infirmary, cooperative, barbershop, basketball court, etc. The workers were very satisfied with this.
    (5) Establish scientific management methods and systems. In August, all the plant's cadres studied the scientific management methods of the Sino-Soviet joint venture factory in Dalian, and began the responsibility system in production, sorted out the production organization, and established a daily report system for major cadres, as well as labor discipline and reward systems based on conscious effort; and gradually established a cost accounting system under the principles of saving raw materials, reducing costs, increasing production, improving quality, and accurately grasping prices. The work began to enter a new stage.
    Develop Production According to Farmers' Needs
    II. Develop production according to farmers' needs through investigation and research. The plant conducted investigations of farmers' needs during experiments in the countryside, and accepted many valuable opinions from farmers: such as the weeding hoe handle being too high and inconvenient, the double-horse drawn plow being changed to a single-horse drawn plow to save livestock, the double handle of the plow being changed to a single handle, and wheels being installed in front of the plow blade, etc. Based on industrial exhibition experience, it was known that the farmers liked weeding hoes, horse-drawn plows, and grass cutters and mowers the most. Meeting these needs of farmers became the basis of their production plan. In the past four months, these products have been in short supply. Orders from farmers in Chahar, Suiyuan, Jizhong, Jinan, Jidong, Jinzhong, Ji Lu Yu, Taihang, and Pingyuan areas, for weeding hoes alone, amounted to 54,000 units. Based on the characteristic of North China having droughts nine years out of ten, they are manufacturing water pumps on a large scale, researching the use of power by wind power and other methods, and conducting various sample experiments. Twenty-nine types have now been made.
    Resolutely Rely on the Working Class to Give Play to the Wisdom of the Working Class
    III. Resolutely rely on the workers and give play to the wisdom of the working class. In mobilizing workers to discuss the factory's production plan, offer ideas, and formulate plans, the workers felt that they were the masters of the factory, and the production mood became active. Later, many manufacturing difficulties were overcome by the collective efforts of the workers. When the factory accepted the task of making a 1,500-pound capacity pulping machine for a paper mill, not only had the factory never made such a machine, but it was said that few iron factories in the country could manufacture it. A large wheel of seventy-two hours had to be made. It required melting 1,600 catties of iron, but in the past, Japanese technicians had no confidence in even 1,000 catties, but this time the workers bravely accepted it. After repeated painstaking research and experiments, they finally made it.
    The flat iron raw materials used for making weeding hoes, plows and various agricultural machinery were expensive and not easy to buy on the market, and even if they were bought, they were not the right size. The rolling mill that originally manufactured this raw material had been discontinued during the Kuomintang rule and dismantled into an empty frame. In particular, the "template" of this machine was taken away when the Japanese invaders withdrew, so everyone had no confidence in restoring it. Workers Li Jun and Wang Quanliang were determined to revive the machine that had been stopped for more than four years. They searched everywhere for parts, drew their own drawings day and night, and after more than ten days of painstaking research, they finally made the "template" that could make more than 30 kinds of round and flat raw materials for making machines.
    In order to improve production efficiency and reduce costs, the leadership put forward the call to "turn manual iron work into machine work." After the workers' painstaking research and creation, many parts on the weeding hoe that were originally made by hand were changed to be manufactured by machines. Therefore, the output of weeding hoes decreased from 19 workdays in June to 2.5 workdays in November; and the water pump decreased from 121 workdays in June to 32 workdays in October.
    Unite Technical Personnel and Systematically Improve Technology
    IV. Unite technical personnel. The plant attaches great importance to uniting technical personnel. They conducted patient political education for technical personnel and criticized their erroneous thoughts and styles. In terms of life issues, they tried their best to take care of them and provide them with work convenience as much as possible. In this way, the technical personnel were able to work with peace of mind and played a certain role in improving production. Ma Ji and Li Zhenyu, who had just returned from studying agricultural machinery in the United States, worked hard to change the two-horse drawn plow into a single-horse drawn plow, adapting to the situation of fewer livestock in the countryside. It also adapted to the farmers' demand for light and nimble use, smooth furrows, and good soil turning. Recently, they have organized a technical research association by engineers and workers to systematically improve technology.
    Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices
    V. Respect teachers and love apprentices. In order to unite masters and apprentices in production, the plant has been paying attention to promoting respect for teachers and love for apprentices from the very beginning.
    In the past, the masters had an old style of "keeping a trick up their sleeve," but now they are honored to "train more apprentices." Many masters have formulated competitive methods for training apprentices, established a young workers' night school, hired veteran masters and technical personnel, and spent two hours every night in class. In addition, it is stipulated that examinations will be held every three months to promote apprentices to formal workers. As long as the grades are passing, there is no limit to the years. Therefore, the workers and apprentices greatly improved their ambition, seriously studied technology, and highly demonstrated their enthusiasm. This month, Yang Yinghai, an apprentice who assembled weeding hoes, created a new record of 11.755 minutes per unit (generally it takes 15 minutes).

　　依靠工人改进管理
  　华北农械总厂提高生产
    九个月制造各种农业机械三千多部
    【本报讯】华北农业机械总厂，自解放后开工迄今，经过九个月的艰苦经营，现在已获显著成绩，较刚解放时，工人已增加八倍，生产了近三十种农业机械，数量达三千多部。该厂之所以能够这样迅速发展，在经营管理上有如下几点经验值得介绍。
    学习苏联和东北的经验　明确树立企业经营思想
    一、学习苏联和东北的先进经验。该厂经常研究东北、大连、石家庄等地十余种报纸，讨论了大连关于“学习苏联科学的工业管理制度”的经验，东北局关于“实行经济核算制”的指示，结合当时该厂的情况，明确规定与执行了下述的方针与原则：
    （一）坚决掌握“从无到有，从小到大，由手工业到机械化”一点一滴发展的方针，和某些技术干部好高务远的思想进行了斗争；根据实际需要增添工人，绝不追求数字。
    （二）开始即明确树立企业经营思想，反对“恢复生产时一定要先赔本”的消极看法。他们首先给北京人民造纸厂承做了打浆与造纸等七部机器，获得小米近百万斤，然后添置了必要的器材工具和部分工房，为制造农业机械打下物质基础。
    （三）贯彻“一切为生产服务”的方针，以百分之九十以上的经费和百分之八十以上的人员用于直接生产。
    （四）在工人福利方面，实行了“只有生产发展，才能改善生活”的原则。开始时有些工人提出福利要求，做不到，便给大家解释清楚，而在制造造纸机获利后，就主动拿出一部分来建立了最必要的医务室、合作社、理发室、篮球场等。工人对此很满意。
    （五）建立科学的管理方法与制度。八月间，全厂干部学习了大连中苏合办工厂的科学管理方法，开始了生产上的专责制，整理了生产组织，建立了主要干部日报制，和自觉基础上的劳动纪律、奖励制度等；又在节省原料，减低成本，增加生产，提高质量，确实掌握物价的原则下，逐渐建立了成本核算的会计制度，工作开始进入一个新阶段。
    根据农民需要发展生产
    二、经过调查研究，根据农民需要发展生产。该厂曾在下乡实验中，调查农民要求，并接受了农民许多宝贵的意见：如耘锄柄太高，不方便，双马拉犁改成单马拉犁可节省牲口，犁的双柄要改成单炳，犁刀前面要装轮子等。并根据工展经验，知道农民最欢喜的是耘锄，马拉犁，铡草与割草机。满足农民这些需求，便成了他们生产计划的依据。四个月来，这些产品供不应求。察哈尔、绥远、冀中、冀南、冀东、晋中、冀鲁豫、太行、平原等地农民的订货，仅耘锄一项，即有五万四千部。他们又根据华北十年九旱的特点，大规模制造水泵，研究以风力等各种方法使用动力，并作多种样品实验，现已制成二十九种。
    坚决依靠工人阶级发挥工人阶级的智慧
    三、坚决依靠工人，发挥工人阶级的智慧。在发动工人讨论工厂生产计划中，出主意、订计划，使工人感到自己是工厂的主人，生产情绪便积极起来。以后许多制造上的困难，都在工人集体努力下克服了。当厂里接受了造纸厂一千五百磅容量打浆机的任务时，因为这种机器不独该厂没做过，据说国内所有铁工厂也很少能制造的。要做七十二时的大轮。需熔铁水一千六百斤，过去日本技师连一千斤也没有把握，这次工人们却勇敢地接受了。他们经过三番五次的苦心研究试验，终于做成了。
    做耘锄，犁和多种农业机械所用的扁铁原料，市场上既贵且不容易买，买来也不合尺寸，原制造此项原料的轧钢机，国民党统治时期已经停用，拆成了空架子，特别这一机器的“样板”在日寇退走时带走了，因此大家都没有信心去恢复他。工人李俊、王全亮决心要使停止了四年多的机器苏醒，他们到处找回零件，夜以继日地自己绘图，经过十几天的苦心钻研，终于做出了“样板”，能做三十多种造机器的圆扁原料。
    为了提高生产效率，减低成本，领导上提出“把铁的手工活变成机器活”的号召，经过工人们的苦心钻研与创造，原来用手工做的耘锄上的许多零件，都改用机器制造。所以耘锄产量由六月份的十九工，降至十一月份的二工半；水泵则由六月份的一百二十一工，降到十月份的三十二工。
    团结技术人员有计划提高技术
    四、团结技术人员。该厂是非常重视团结技术人员的。他们对技术人员进行了耐心的政治教育，并对其错误的思想作风进行批评。生活问题上，则尽量照顾，尽可能给以工作上的方便。这样，使术技人员们都安心工作，并在改进生产中发挥了一定的作用。刚从美国留学回来，专门研究农业机械的马骥和李振宇，经过努力研究，把二马拉的犁改成了单马拉，适应了农村牲口少的情况。也适应了使用轻捷，犁沟平整，翻土完好等的农民要求。最近他们由工程师和工人组织了技术研究会，有计划的提高技术。
    尊师爱徒
    五、尊师爱徒。为使师徒团结生产，该厂一开始就注意提倡尊师爱徒。
    师傅们过去有一种“留一手”的旧作风，现已变成以“能多培养徒弟”为光荣了。好些师傅都订了培养徒弟的竞赛办法，成立了青工夜校，聘请老师傅及技术人员，每晚抽出二小时上课。另外，还规定了每隔三个月举行考试，提拔学徒为正式工人的制度，只要成绩及格，是不拘年限的。因此工徒们大大提高了进取心，认真的学习技术，高度发挥积极性。本月份装配耘锄，工徒杨瀛海以每部十一．七五五分钟创造了新纪录（一般要装十五分种）。
