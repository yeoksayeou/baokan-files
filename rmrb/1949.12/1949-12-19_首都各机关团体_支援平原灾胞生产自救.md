　　Capital Agencies and Organizations
  　Support the Production and Self-Salvation of Disaster-Stricken People in Pingyuan
    [Reported by this newspaper] Due to the long-term plunder by enemy puppets and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, rural areas in Pingyuan Province have suffered consecutive years of poor harvests, compounded by natural disasters such as floods, droughts, insects, and hailstorms this year, resulting in a very serious disaster situation. In addition to the provincial people's government allocating large amounts of grain and funds to organize the masses for production and self-salvation, Beijing agencies, organizations, enterprises, and schools are extremely concerned about the disaster-stricken people in Pingyuan Province. They are economizing on food and clothing and actively donating large quantities of supplies. According to statistics, the Central People's Government and the former North China People's Government have successively remitted 270 million yuan and 300,000 jin of millet to the province. This has greatly increased the confidence of the disaster victims in the province in production and self-salvation. The disaster-stricken people and governments at all levels in the province are very grateful for the concern shown by the capital's agencies, organizations, enterprises, schools, and people from all walks of life.

    【本报讯】平原省由于敌伪蒋匪长期掠夺，农村连年歉收，更加今年水旱虫雹等自然灾害，灾情十分严重，除该省人民政府已拨大批粮款组织群众生产自救外，北京各机关、团体、企业、学校，对平原省灾胞极为关怀。他们节衣缩食，积极大量捐助。据统计，经中央人民政府及前华北人民政府先后汇往该省捐款已达二亿七千万元，小米三十万斤。大大增加了该省灾民生产自救的信心。该省灾胞及各级政府，对首都各机关、团体、企业、学校及各界同胞的关切之情，均十分感激。
