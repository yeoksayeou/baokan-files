　　Jiaocheng Elementary School Teachers, Students, and Masses Work Together
    To Build 68 School Buildings
  　Shanxi Provincial Government Issues Commendation
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Jiaocheng County, Shanxi Province, launched an elementary school construction movement, building 68 school buildings. The elementary school buildings in the county had been in disrepair for years. Starting in March this year, some schools, in order to overcome financial difficulties, teachers and students personally participated, moving bricks and tiles, and building campuses, which won praise from the masses. After July, the leadership appropriately promoted this, with the village making a budget and the county approving it, spending some money to hire workers and buy lime, etc. The rest relied on the personal efforts of teachers and students, and the local masses automatically proposed methods of donating materials and helping with labor, setting off a wave of school construction in the villages. In the past two months, 68 elementary school buildings have been built, totaling 476 classrooms, 46 playgrounds, and 1,025 sets of desks and benches, using only 39,359 catties of millet, with the masses contributing 1,506 workdays. The school buildings in the county have largely been resolved. The Shanxi Provincial Government has issued a commendation. Furthermore, in Dongyingpan District, Zhangbei County, Chahar Province, 35 administrative villages also used the same method to build 29 schools.

　　交城各小学师生群众齐动手
    修建校舍六十八处
  　山西省府通令表扬
    【本报讯】山西交城县展开小学建校运动，修建校舍六十八处。该县小学校舍，连年失修，今年三月起，部分学校为克服财政困难，师生亲自动手，搬砖运瓦，修建校园，曾博得群众赞扬。七月后，领导上适当加以提倡，由村造预算县批准，花一部分钱雇工匠、买石灰等，其余皆靠师生亲自动手，当地群众自动提出献料助工的办法，各村掀起建校热潮。两个月来已修建小学校舍六十八处，计教室四百七十六间，游戏场四十六处，桌凳一千零二十五副，仅用去小米三万九千三百五十九斤，群众助工一千五百零六个。全县校舍大部得到解决。山西省府已通令表扬。又察哈尔省张北县东营盘区三十五个行政村，也用同样办法，建校二十九处。
