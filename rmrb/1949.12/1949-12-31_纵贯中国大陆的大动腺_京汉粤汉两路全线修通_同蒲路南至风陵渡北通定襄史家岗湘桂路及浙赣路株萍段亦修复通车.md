Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th: The two major railways traversing mainland China, the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou railways, have been fully repaired. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway, with a total length of 1,384 kilometers, was fully repaired on the 27th and fully opened to traffic on the 28th. Passenger and freight transport will begin on January 1, 1950. The Beijing-Hankou Railway, with a total length of 1,212 kilometers, completed the repair of its last section, from Shijiazhuang to Anyang, as early as the 12th of this month, and will be fully opened to traffic on January 1, 1950. Thus, China's north-south railway transportation, starting from Manchuria on the northern border, passing through Harbin, Shenyang, Beijing, and Wuhan, can directly reach the southern port of Guangzhou, connecting the Northeast, North China, Central China, and South China. The Beijing-Hankou Railway was interrupted after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937 and had not been fully opened to traffic for thirteen years. The repair of this railway began on January 4th of this year. With the efforts of the Railway Engineering Corps, railway workers, and the people along the line, the Beijing-Baoding section was first repaired. After the liberation of Wuhan, in order to support the People's Liberation Army's advance into Central and South China, the Zhengzhou-Hankou section of the railway was also soon repaired and opened to traffic. Subsequently, the Anyang-Xinxiang and Baoding-Shijiazhuang sections were also repaired one after another. The last section, the 231 kilometers between Shijiazhuang and Anyang, was the most difficult to repair. Not only were all the rails and sleepers lost, but many roadbeds had been turned into farmland. However, the soldiers of the 4th Detachment of the Railway Engineering Corps braved the winter cold and worked day and night, completing the repair in just over a month. As for the full repair of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, thanks to the joint efforts of the staff of the Hengyang Railway Bureau, the 2nd Detachment of the Railway Engineering Corps, and the Central China Railway Force, it was completed only two and a half months after the liberation of Guangzhou on October 14th.

　　[Another Dispatch] The repair of the southern section of the Tongpu Railway from Linfen to Fenglingdu has been completed on the 25th, thanks to the efforts of more than 3,000 railway workers and more than 2,000 civilian workers from the Taiyuan Railway Bureau. The northern section has been repaired to Shijiagang, which belongs to Dingxiang County, north of Xin County. The Tongpu Railway with Taiyuan as the center now runs trains north to Shijiagang and south to Fenglingdu, making transportation along the line extremely convenient.

　　[Our newspaper Hankou, 30th] More than 1,700 kilometers of the people's railways, including the Guangdong-Hankou, Xiang-Gui (except for the Lijiachiao near Guilin), and the Zhuzhou-Pingxiang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways, were fully opened to traffic on the 28th. A grand opening ceremony was held on the 30th.

　　纵贯中国大陆的大动腺
  　京汉粤汉两路全线修通
    同蒲路南至风陵渡北通定襄史家岗湘桂路及浙赣路株萍段亦修复通车
    【新华社北京二十九日电】纵贯中国大陆的京汉、粤汉两大铁路均已全线修复。全长一千三百八十四公里的粤汉铁路系于二十七日全线修复，并已于二十八日全线通车。一九五○年元旦将开始办理客货运业务。全长一千二百十二公里的京汉铁路，其最后一段石家庄到安阳间的修复工程，早于本月十二日竣工，一九五○年元旦即可全线通车。至此，我国南北铁路交通，从北方国境线上的满洲里起，经过哈尔滨、沈阳、北京、武汉已可直达国境南端的大港口广州，贯通了东北、华北、华中和华南。京汉铁路自一九三七年抗日战争瀑发后即告中断，十三年来未能全线通车。该路的修复工程于今年一月四日即已开始，在铁道兵团、铁路员工和沿线人民的努力下，首先修复北京保定段。武汉解放后，为支援人民解放军向华中华南进军，该路郑州至汉口一段，不久亦告修复通车。其后安阳至新乡和保定至石家庄两段又相继修复。最后石家庄至安阳间二百三十一公里的一段，为工程最艰苦的一段，不仅钢轨、枕木全部散失，许多路基且已夷为农田。但铁道兵团四支队的战士们，冒冬季严寒昼夜赶修，仅以一个多月的时间即告修成。至于粤汉铁路的全线修复，经衡阳铁路局员工、铁道兵团二支队和华中铁道部队的共同努力，距十月十四日广州解放仅两个半月。
    【又讯】同蒲铁路南段临汾至风陵渡的修复工程，经太原铁路局的三千多铁路员工和两千多民工的努力，已于二十五日竣工。北段则已修至忻县以北定襄县属的史家岗。刻以太原为中心的同蒲路列车已北通史家岗南通风陵渡，沿线交通运输极为便利。
    【本报汉口三十日电】粤汉、湘桂（除桂林附近的李家桥外）和浙赣路株萍段共一千七百余公里的人民铁道，已于二十八日全线通车。并于三十日举行了隆重通车典礼。
