Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th: A delayed dispatch from Osaka: The Overseas Chinese New Democratic Association in Japan held a grand meeting on November 6th at the Central Public Hall in Osaka, Japan, to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China. The meeting was held despite a warning issued on the 5th by the Osaka Police Department and the American occupation authorities stating "the flag of the People's Republic of China must not be hung at the meeting venue." Over a thousand people attended the meeting, including overseas Chinese in Osaka and Japanese and Korean guests.

　　The meeting began with a speech by Chen Chengjia, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Overseas Chinese New Democratic Association. He said: It is a joyous occasion that we can hold this meeting in Osaka, with the participation of overseas Chinese and Japanese and Korean friends, to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China. He called on all overseas Chinese in Japan to strengthen their unity and work closely with the Japanese and Korean people to fight for the defense of peace. Yu En'yang, Vice President of the Overseas Chinese General Association in Japan, said: Overseas Chinese in Japan should unite with the Japanese and Korean people to defeat the reactionary forces. Gan Wenfang, of the Central Committee of the Overseas Chinese Democratic Promotion Association, said: In light of the recent series of police incidents in Japan, it is difficult for me to report to our people in the motherland that Japan has become democratic. The Japanese people should remember Marx's famous saying, "A nation that oppresses other nations cannot itself be free." Let us join hands with those Japanese people whose hands have not been stained with the blood of the Chinese people to jointly fight for the defense of peace in East Asia.

　　During the guest speeches, Kawakami Kan'ichi, a member of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Communist Party, praised the founding of the People's Republic of China as an unprecedented revolution in human history, on par with the October Revolution. He said: If we in Japan do not establish a people's government and join hands with the Chinese people and the Korean people who are striving for the reunification of their motherland, we cannot defend Japan's national independence. Hashimoto Masao of the Labor-Farmer Party said: The victory of the Chinese people today proves that we will surely be able to achieve the same victory in Japan as the Chinese people, with our own hands. He said: The Japanese people resolutely oppose the attempt to conclude a separate peace treaty without the participation of the Soviet Union and New China.

　　After the meeting, recreational performances were held. The meeting concluded with a closing speech by Lai Zhucun, Deputy Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Overseas Chinese New Democratic Association, and was adjourned victoriously amidst thunderous applause.

　　留日华侨为祖国欢呼
　  大阪千余人大集会庆祝新中国诞生决心与日朝人民团结共同保卫和平
    【新华社北京二十五日电】大阪迟到消息：留日华侨新民主协会于十一月六日在日本大报中央公会堂召开盛大的庆祝中华人民共和国成立的大会。大会是在日本大阪警察厅和美国占领当局于五日发出“不得在大会会场悬挂中华人民共和国国旗”的警告下举行的。大会到有大阪华侨及日本、朝鲜来宾共千余人。
    大会首由华侨新民主协会执行委员会委员长陈承家致词。他说：今天能在大阪召开侨胞及日本、朝鲜各位先生参加的庆祝中华人民共和国成立的大会，是一件可喜的事情。他号召全体留日华侨要加强团结，并和日本及朝鲜人民紧密携手，共为保卫和平而斗争。留日华侨总会副会长于恩洋说：留日华侨应该和日本及朝鲜人民互相团结，击溃反动势力。华侨民主促进会中央委员会甘文芳说：鉴于日本最近一连串的警察事件，我很难向我们祖国人民报告日本已经民主化。日本人民应当记着马克思的“压迫其他民族的民族，本身也得不到自由”的名言，让我们和那些手上未曾染过中国人民的血的日本人，亲密携手，共同为保卫东亚和平而斗争吧。
    在来宾发言时，日本共产党众院议员川上贯一称赞中华人民共和国的成立，是与十月革命同为人类历史上空前的大革命。他说：如果我们日本不建立人民的政府并和中国人民及正在争取祖国统一的朝鲜人民携手，便不能保卫日本的民族独立。劳农党的桥本正雄说：中国人民今天的胜利，证明我们一定能用我们人民的手，在日本获得与中国人民同样的胜利。他说：日本人民坚决反对没有苏联和新中国参加的单独缔结和约的企图。
    会后举行游艺节目。大会最后在华侨新民主协会执委会副委员长赖珠村致闭幕词后，于雷动的掌声中宣告胜利闭会。
