　　Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative

　　Organizes Suburban Disaster Victims for Sideline Production

　　[Report from this newspaper] In order to help disaster victims in the suburbs of Beijing to produce and help themselves, and to develop winter sideline and handicraft production, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has organized farmers in Nanyuan and Xiyuan to engage in production such as boiling saltpeter and making straw ropes. Since the beginning of November, until the end of November, eighty saltpeter boiling groups have been organized, with a total of ninety-one saltpeter pots. There are 604 households participating in the production, with a total of more than 900 people. Each saltpeter pot can produce an average of 400 catties of saltpeter per day and night, and after expenses, a profit of one shi and two dou of corn can be obtained. Each person can earn a net profit of seventeen or eighteen catties of corn per day, which can support ten people. Ninety-one pots can solve the livelihood problems of nearly ten thousand people. In order to solve the difficulties for saltpeter producers in purchasing saltpeter pots and utensils, the cooperative has adopted the method of advance purchase, and has now pre-purchased 134,611.5 catties of crude saltpeter. The cooperative is now negotiating with Beijing Fengli Chemical Company and Tianjin Huabei Chemical Company to sign a contract to exchange crude saltpeter for coarse grains for direct supply to the saltpeter producers for consumption. In addition, the villages of Haidian, Liulangzhuang, Bagou, Beiwu, and Yimuyuan in Xiyuan District originally had a foundation for making straw ropes. Because production was decentralized, it was not possible to directly enter into contracts with factories that needed straw ropes, and it was not possible to avoid exploitation by purchasing merchants. Therefore, the cooperative is organizing straw rope production groups or production cooperatives on the basis of restoring the old foundation and absorbing household handicraft workers; on the other hand, it is uniformly purchasing products and supplying them to major factories at low profits. This will not only eliminate intermediate exploitation but also avoid the squeeze of larger factories producing straw ropes on the rural straw rope industry. Currently, Bagou, Liulangzhuang, Haidian and other villages have jointly organized 250 machines. Each machine can produce six bundles of straw ropes per day and night (each bundle has five coils, each coil is thirty zhang), and a net profit of two catties and four taels of corn can be obtained after deducting all expenses. Two hundred and fifty machines can solve the livelihood problems of more than nine hundred people every day.

　　京市供销总社
    组织郊区灾民进行副业生产
    【本报讯】北京市供销合作总社为扶助郊区灾民生产自救，开展冬季副业及手工业生产，特在南苑、西苑组织农民从事熬硝、打草绳等生产。自十一月初开始，到十一月底已组织起八十个熬硝小组，共九十一个硝锅。参加生产者有六○四户，共九百余人。每一硝锅一昼夜平均可产硝四百斤，除开支外可获利一石二斗玉米。每人每天可净赚玉米十七、八斤，能养活十口人，九十一个锅共可解决近万人的生活问题。为了解决硝民购置硝锅用具等困难，该社采用预购的办法，现已预购到皮硝一三四六一一．五斤，现该社正与北京丰利化学公司和天津华北化学公司协商签订合同，用皮硝交换粗粮，以直接供给硝民吃用。此外，西苑区海甸、六郎庄、巴沟、北屋、一亩园等村，原有打草绳基础。因为是分散生产，不能和需用草绳之工厂直接订立合同，不能避免收购商从中剥削。故总社一面在恢复旧有基础上组织草绳生产小组或生产合作社，并吸收家庭手工业者参加；一面统一收购产品，低利供给各大工厂。这样既可免除中间剥削，又可避免生产草绳之较大工厂对农村草绳业之排挤。现巴沟、六郎庄、海甸等村，已共组织起二五○台机子，每台机子一昼夜可出草绳六捆（每捆五盘，每盘三十丈），除去一切开支外，可得二斤四两玉米之纯利。二五○台机子每天可解决九百余人之生活问题。
