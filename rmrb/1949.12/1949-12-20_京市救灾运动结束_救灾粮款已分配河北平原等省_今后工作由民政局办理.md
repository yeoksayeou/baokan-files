　　Beijing Disaster Relief Campaign Concludes
  　Disaster Relief Funds and Grain Distributed to Hebei Plain and Other Provinces
    Future Work to be Handled by the Civil Affairs Bureau
    [Beijing News] The Beijing disaster relief campaign, which lasted two months and penetrated all levels of the city, has now concluded victoriously. The Beijing All-Circles Disaster Relief Committee, composed of various government agencies, organizations, and parties, and its affiliated branches, officially ended on the 10th of this month after completing its mission. All unfinished matters have been transferred to the Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Bureau for continued handling. Thanks to the widespread spirit of mutual assistance and friendship between urban and rural residents, and the enthusiastic assistance to farmers in disaster areas, the committee had received a total of 520,420,790.61 yuan in donations, 121,231.6 jin of food grain, and 52,371 items of clothing, shoes, and socks from all walks of life by the time the Disaster Relief Committee concluded its work. The Standing Committee of the Disaster Relief Committee has decided on the distribution method for all grain, funds, and clothing, which has been approved by the State Council of the Central People's Government. The majority of the cash funds have been allocated to Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi provinces to relieve the disaster victims in those provinces. The food grain, due to its diverse types and inconvenient transportation, has all been donated to Beijing to relieve disaster victims in the suburbs of Beijing and disaster victims who are displaced in Beijing and other areas. Clothing items have been allocated to Hebei Province and Beijing. The allocation of grain, funds, and clothing is as follows: (1) Hebei Province: 150 million yuan, 32,537 items of clothing. (2) Pingyuan Province: 263,312,428 yuan (of which 50 million yuan was additionally allocated to the province after the end of the committee, with the approval of the State Council upon the Municipal Government's request). (3) Shanxi Province: 50 million yuan. (4) Urban area of Beijing: 43,231.6 jin of food grain, 8,134 items of clothing, and 40,000 yuan in temporary relief funds. (5) Suburban area of Beijing: 78,000 jin of food grain, 8,134 items of clothing. (6) Beijing Women's Production and Education Center: 40 items of clothing. In addition, there is a remaining 57,068,362.61 yuan and 3,526 items of clothing, which have been transferred to the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau and will be handled by the bureau along with any subsequently received grain, funds, and clothing. Organizations or individuals who have not yet delivered the pledged grain, funds, or clothing can promptly deliver them to the following locations designated by the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau: (1) Cash should be delivered to the Business Department of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China and its three affiliated offices in the Eastern, Western, and Southern districts for collection. (2) Food grain should be delivered to Warehouse No. 42, Dongxiaopai Fang Hutong, Dongdan, and Warehouse No. 27, Laku Hutong, Di'anmen Nei, which belong to the Beijing General Supply and Marketing Cooperative for collection. (3) Clothing should be delivered to the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, No. 8, Nanwei Hutong, Xisi Beidajie.
