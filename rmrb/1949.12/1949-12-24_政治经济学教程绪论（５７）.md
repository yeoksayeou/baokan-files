　　Introduction to Political Economy Tutorial (57)
    Section 3: The Class Nature, Party Affiliation, and Internationalism of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    Bourgeois political economy can never have its unity and internationalism.
    All these demonstrate that in different stages of capitalist development, due to the different interests of the bourgeoisie, different economic theories emerge. And because the interests of the bourgeoisie in capitalist countries are inconsistent and the economic development of capitalist countries is unbalanced, representing the different interests of the bourgeoisie in various countries, different, contradictory, mutually exclusive, and forever unifiable economic theories occur in each country. Therefore, due to the contradictions and disunity of the bourgeoisie itself and the interests of the bourgeoisie in various countries, it is determined that bourgeois political economy can never have its unity and internationalism. They can only be narrow nationalist, or narrow bourgeois nationalist, and fanatical aggressive. In colonial and semi-colonial countries, it manifests as comprador, servile, and treasonous.
    Section 4: The Revolutionary, Combative, and Practical Nature of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    The fourth characteristic of Marxist-Leninist political economy is its revolutionary, combative, and practical nature.
    The proletariat is the most revolutionary class in modern times, the gravedigger of capitalist society, and the creator of socialist society. Therefore, as one of the sciences of proletarian revolution, Marxist-Leninist political economy must possess full revolutionary, combative, and practical nature. First, let's talk about revolutionary nature.
    Revolutionary nature – critical nature
    From its establishment, Marxist-Leninist political economy has theoretically analyzed and criticized the capitalist economy and the dominant role of the bourgeoisie in the capitalist economy scientifically. In the process of criticism, it pointed out the inevitable path of human social development and the correct future of the proletarian revolution. It believes that the capitalist economy is only a temporary transitional nature in the entire history of mankind. That is to say, Marxist-Leninist political economy not only recognizes the occurrence, establishment, and development of the capitalist economy, but also points out the inevitable death of capitalism, the inevitable overthrow of the capitalist system by the proletarian revolution, the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship, and the replacement of it by a socialist society. Today, in colonial and semi-colonial countries, the working class leads the masses of the people to overthrow the social system of colonial and semi-colonial countries, establish a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and transition to socialism through new democracy. Therefore, this view and understanding of Marxist-Leninist political economy is revolutionary, and its criticism of capitalist society and capitalist economy, as well as colonial and semi-colonial society and its economy, is also revolutionary.
    Close connection between scientific, revolutionary, combative, and practical nature
    The ultimate purpose of theory is to "transform the weapon of criticism into the criticism of weapons." Marxist-Leninist political economy is both a weapon of criticism and a basis for the criticism of weapons. The task of this science itself is not only to clarify the laws of various social and economic movements, but more importantly, to overthrow and eliminate capitalism and all other systems of exploitation of man by man, to establish a socialist society and a socialist economy without exploitation, or other social economies of transitional forms leading to socialism. Therefore, when revolutionary theory is grasped by the revolutionary masses, it becomes revolutionary practice. Therefore, the scientific, revolutionary, combative, and practical nature of Marxist-Leninist political economy are so closely unified and combined in Marxist-Leninist political economy.
    Revolutionary critical nature is one of the basic characteristics of Marxist-Leninist political economy.
    This revolutionary critical nature is obviously fundamentally different from those criticisms that grab a bit here and a bit there, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. This revolutionary critical nature is one of the basic characteristics of Marxist-Leninist political economy. In "What is to be Done", Lenin gave a concise and incisive exposition of the critical revolutionary characteristics of Marxism, the combination of the highly rigorous scientific nature and revolutionary nature of its theory itself, and the task of scientific revolutionary struggle:
    "Marx thought that the whole value of his theory lies in that this theory 'in its essence, is a critical and revolutionary theory'. And the latter quality is really completely and absolutely inherent in Marxism, because this theory directly recognizes its own task is to expose all forms of antagonism and exploitation in the current society (capitalist society), examine its development, prove its temporary nature and the inevitability of its transformation into another form, and thus to help the proletariat to eliminate any exploitation as quickly and as easily as possible. The irresistible attraction that makes socialists in various countries tend to this theory lies in that this theory combines the strict highest scientific nature (it is the peak of social science) and revolutionary nature, and not accidentally combined, not only because the founder of this doctrine himself combines the character of a scholar and the character of a revolutionary in himself, but because it combines these two characteristics inseparably within the theory itself. Indeed, it is directly recognized here: the task of theory, the purpose of science is to help the proletariat to carry out its economic struggle which is already in practice." (Lenin: "What is to be Done")
    The content of Marxist-Leninist political economy itself is also full of revolutionary and critical nature.
    As far as the content of Marxist-Leninist political economy itself is concerned, for example, the content of the first volume of "Capital"—the production process of capital, the content of the second volume—the circulation process of capital, the content of the third volume—the total production process of capitalism, have a meticulous, detailed, and clear analysis of the essence of the capitalist economy. Through these analyses, the laws of capitalist economic movement are pointed out, and the truth and actual content of capitalist society and its economic foundation are exposed. From this, it points out the process of capitalist economic movement, how the proletariat is squeezed by the bourgeoisie in capitalist society, and at the same time how it is organized and trained by the bourgeoisie, and how the proletariat organizes itself and trains itself to fight against the bourgeoisie. And it indicates the inevitable trend of capitalist economic development, to illustrate the inevitable victory of the proletariat and the inevitable rise of socialist economy to replace capitalist economy. It also tells us how to organize forces to fight against the domestic counter-revolutionary remnants and fight against foreign enemies after the victory of the revolution. Therefore, it itself is full of scientific, revolutionary, and critical nature.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（５７）
    第三节马列主义政治经济学的阶级性、党派性与国际性
    资产阶级政治经济学永远不可能有它的统一性与国际性
    这些都说明着资产阶级在资本主义发展不同的阶段上，由于资产阶级利益的不同，而有不同的经济学说出现，并由于资本主义各国资产阶级利害不一致与资本主义各国经济发展的不平衡，代表各国资产阶级不同的利益，各国遂有各不相同相互矛盾、相互排斥永远不能统一的经济学说发生出现。所以由于资产阶级本身与各国资产阶级利益的矛盾与不统一，决定了资产阶级政治经济学永远不可能有它的统一性与国际性，它们只能是狭隘的国家主义的或狭隘的资产阶级的民族主义的与疯狂的侵略主义的。而在殖民地半殖民地国家内，则表现其为买办性、奴隶性、叛卖性。
    第四节　马列主义政治经济学的革命性、战斗性与实践性
    马列主义政治经济学的特点之四，便是它的革命性、战斗性与实践性。
    无产阶级是现代最革命的阶级，是资本主义社会的掘墓人，社会主义社会的创建者，故作为无产阶级革命的科学之一的马列主义政治经济学，必然具备着充分的革命性、战斗性与实践性。首先说革命性。
    革命性——批判性
    马列主义政治经济学从它成立那时起，就从理论上对资本主义经济以及资产阶级在资本主义经济中所具的支配作用，加以科学的分析与批判，并在批判的过程中，指示出了人类社会发展的必然的道路与无产阶级革命的正确的前途。它认为资本主义经济在整个人类历史上只不过是暂时的过渡的性质。这就是说：马列主义政治经济学不单单认识到资本主义经济的发生、成立与发展，并且指示出了资本主义的必然死亡，将由无产阶级革命来推翻资本主义制度，建立无产阶级专政，由社会主义社会起而代之的必然性。在今天殖民地半殖民地国家里则由工人阶级领导人民大众，来推翻殖民地半殖民地的社会制度，建立工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，通过新民主主义过渡到社会主义去。所以马列主义政治经济学的这种观点，这种认识是革命的，它对于资本主义社会与资本主义经济以及对于殖民地半殖民地社会及其经济的批判也是革命的。
    科学性、革命性、战斗性与实践的密切联系
    理论的极终目的是“批判的武器变为武器的批判”，马列主义政治经济学既是批判的武器，又是武器批判的根据。这种科学本身，其任务不仅在于阐明各种社会经济运动的规律，重要的还是在于推翻和消灭资本主义的与其他一切人吃人的剥削制度，建立没有人剥削人的社会主义社会和社会主义的经济，或者其他引导到社会主义去的过渡形式的社会经济。因此革命的理论当为革命的群众所掌握时就变为革命的实践。因此马列主义政治经济学的科学性、革命性、战斗性与实践性，在马列主义政治经济学里便是这样严密地统一着结合着。
    革命的批判性是马列主义政治经济学的基本特色之一
    这种革命的批判性，显然是与那些东抓一把西抓一把头痛医头脚痛医脚的批判，是有着根本的区别的。这种革命的批判性是马列主义政治经济学的基本特点之一。列宁在什么是人民之友一书中，曾对马克思主义特具的批判的革命的特色，和它理论本身高度的严格的科学性与革命性的结合及科学的革命的斗争的任务，有扼要精辟的阐述：
    “马克思认为他本人理论底全部价值，是在于他这理论‘按其实质本身是批判的和革命的理论’。而后面这个品质，真正是完全和绝对为马克思主义所固有的，因为这个理论直接认定它自己的任务是要暴露现社会（资本主义社会）里对抗和剥削底一切形式，考察其发展情形，证明其暂时性质及其转变为另一种形式的不可避免性，并这样来帮助无产阶级使它尽可能迅速地和尽可能容易地消灭任何剥削。那使世界各国社会主义者都趋向于这个理论的不可遏止的吸引力，也就是在于这个理论把严格的最高度的科学性（它是社会科学底顶峰）和革命性结合起来，而且不是偶然结合起来，不仅是因为这学说底创始人自己把学者品性和革命家的品性结合于自己一身，而是因为它把这两种特性不可分离地结合在这个理论本身的内部。的确在这里直接认定：理论底任务，科学的目的就是帮助无产阶级来进行其已在实际进行着的经济斗争。”（列宁：“什么是人民之友”）
    马列主义政治经济学本身的内容也是充满着革命性、批判性的
    就马列主义政治经济学本身的内容而言，例如资本论第一卷的内容——资本的生产过程，第二卷的内容——资本的流通过程，第三卷的内容——资本主义的总生产过程，对于资本主义经济的实质，有着周密详细而明确的分析，通过这些分析指出了资本主义经济运动的规律，暴露了资本主义社会以及这个社会经济基础的真相与实际内容。由这来指出资本主义经济运动过程，无产阶级在资本主义社会怎样被资产阶级所压榨，同时怎样又被资产阶级所组织起来，训练起来，无产阶级又怎样组织自己，训练自己怎样来与资产阶级进行斗争。以及指示出资本主义经济发展的必然趋势，来说明无产阶级的必然胜利，社会主义经济之必然代替资本主义的经济而兴起。它又指示给我们，当革命胜利以后，应当怎样组织力量以反对国内的反革命残余势力以及和国外的敌人斗争。因此，它本身乃是充满着科学性、革命性与批判性的。
