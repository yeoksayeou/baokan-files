It is said that when the People's Liberation Army arrived at Bianshui, the people of Tangdiwan became a little chaotic.

　　Grandpa Tai Wu was cursing, saying that everyone hadn't even seen the shadow of the Communist Party, so how could they know the Communist Party would steal things? But some people said he was senile. The last time the "Three People's Principles Youth League" from Zhijiang sent people to the village to collect self-defense donations, those people wearing dark glasses clearly said: "If the Communist Party comes, they will even snatch the children's diapers!" How could we not hide?

　　The urgent shouts became more and more intense. He San's wife, who sold white sugar glutinous rice cakes in the small shop next to the highway, became even more flustered. She picked up a few old clothes from the bedside, dragged her child, and ran out of the door in a hurry, joining some people who had been deceived by rumors and ran to the back mountain of Tangdiwan.

　　Grandpa Tai Wu didn't hide. He lay in bed thinking: "It is said that the Communist Party came from Mayang. If they really snatch even diapers, why didn't the people of Mayang hide?" There was a burst of horses' hooves on the highway, and the sound of artillery carts dragging over the small bridge. Grandpa Tai Wu got up and lit the lamp twice, thinking about going outside the village to see, but he was a little afraid. No matter how fiercely the rogues in dark glasses from the city described the Communist Party, according to past experience, the passage of troops has never been a good thing, and our farmers are bound to suffer; it's better not to go looking for trouble. But another thing puzzled him: why didn't any soldiers come into the village to conscript laborers, and even the dogs were sleeping soundly? It was really strange!

　　After dawn, Grandpa Tai Wu couldn't bear it any longer. He hid in the haystack above the highway to see what kind of people the Communist Party soldiers were. The haystack was directly opposite He San's wife's small shop. This woman probably left in too much of a hurry, didn't even close the door, and even those snow-white glutinous rice cakes were still spread out on the table.

　　A team of soldiers came from the west, wearing large bamboo hats and straw sandals, forming two long lines, only heading towards Zhijiang, and not a single one stopped. After a while, four more came, one with thick eyebrows supporting a short man, and the other two limping (one with a cane) were dragging behind. "Okay, okay, there are cakes to buy here, eat something, and I guarantee you'll get better," the thick-browed man shouted.

　　Arriving next to the shop, they called out "Boss" several times, but no one answered. The three sick soldiers sat on the highway, not entering the shop. The thick-browed man said anxiously while standing in the house: "What to do? There's food to eat but we're starving, and the boss isn't home." The one with the cane said: "Regardless of whether he's home or not, just leave the money for the cakes." But no one paid attention to him. Everyone muttered for a while, then poured rice from the rice bags they brought to cook porridge, and didn't mention buying cakes again. The snow-white glutinous rice cakes aroused the appetite of the one with the cane, and he came to the table several times to look at them, but didn't touch them, only saying casually: "Hmm, these cakes must be very sweet, with white sugar in them."

　　While eating porridge, the short man suddenly thought of something and said: "What should we do about the firewood we burned in this house?" The thick-browed man raised his head: "Give money, what else? It's not even worth a firewood ticket." The one with the cane laughed and said: "You find a ghost to give money to, the boss isn't home." This stumped the thick-browed man. After a pause, he said: "Leave the money here and write a note." "Then why didn't you buy cakes first? It delayed us a lot of time."

　　The conversation was interrupted. After finishing the porridge, he took out a bill, wanting to put it on the table, but suddenly felt uneasy, afraid that someone else would take it. Then, the thick-browed man looked around for someone. When he found Grandpa Tai Wu, he was very happy and handed the bill to him, saying: "Old man, I'm sorry, we burned some firewood here to cook porridge. This is a hundred yuan for the firewood. Please give it to the boss. We are the People's Liberation Army." At this, Grandpa Tai Wu was greatly surprised. After completely understanding the words, he was so moved that he couldn't speak, his mouth always moving, but no sound came out. The two hands holding the bill were also shaking desperately. He stretched his neck, watched the four soldiers leave, and then muttered to himself: "So these are the Communist Party soldiers? They even pay for burning a few pieces of firewood. This is strange. I've lived to seventy-seven this year, and I've never heard of such soldiers... Are they really Communist Party soldiers? No wonder they win so many battles!"

　　That afternoon, the village of Tangdiwan became lively again. The people who had fled returned home quickly, and He San's wife was selling cakes in that small shop as usual, and business was very good. Grandpa Tai Wu scolded her for not hiding last night. The arrival of such an army in Zhijiang was a blessing, and the days of our suffering have come to an end. He told her not to listen to rumors anymore, and that we poor people will have good days. He San's wife also laughed and scolded herself: "Last night, I was really possessed by a ghost, following them around, which delayed me from making a good morning's business."

　　糯米粑
    蒋牧良
    听说人民解放军到了便水，塘底湾的人就有些乱糟糟起来了。
    太五阿公在骂人，说大家没有见共产党的影子，怎么知道共产党要抢东西？可是有的人却说他老糊涂了，上一次芷江的“三民主义青年团”派人来到村里收自卫捐，那几个戴黑眼镜的人就明明说：“如果来了共产党，连小孩的尿布也要给抢走的！”怎么能不躲一躲？
    急促的喊声一阵紧似一阵了，留在公路旁边那小店子里卖白糖糯米粑的和三嫂，更加心慌，她抱起了床头几件烂衣服，拖着孩子，三脚两步跑出了门，就和一些被谣言受骗的人跑到塘底湾的后山里。
    太五阿公没有躲走，他躺在床上想：“听说共产党从麻阳来的，如果他们真的连尿布都要抢，麻阳人又怎么不躲一躲？”公路上有了一阵一阵的马蹄响，又有炮车拖过小桥的声音，太五阿公起来点过两次灯，想到村外看看，可是他有些不敢。不管从城里来的戴黑眼镜的流氓把共产党说得那样凶，可是依往例，过兵从来就不是回好事，咱们庄稼人一定要遭殃；还是不要去找苦头吃吧。但是另外一件事又把他弄迷糊了，怎么没有兵进村里来抓夫，连狗也睡得稳稳的，真是怪事！
    天明以后，太五阿公再也熬不住了，他躲到公路上面的稻草堆里，要看看共产党到底是些什么人物。草堆正对着和三嫂的小店，这女人大概走得太慌，门也没关，连那些雪白的糯米粑也还摊在桌上。
    西头来了一队兵，戴着大斗笠，穿着双梁鞋，拉成两大长串，只管向芷江奔去，没有一个人停下。过了一会，又来了四个，一个深眉毛扶着一矮子走，另外两个跛着脚（一个拄着棍子）都拖在后面。“好了好了，这儿有了粑粑买，吃点儿东西，保你病都好些。”那深眉毛喊。
    来到店子旁边，接连叫了几声“老板”，没人答应，那三个病兵坐在公路上，没有进店，深眉毛站在屋子里发急说：“怎么办？看着东西要挨饿，老板不在家。”拄棍子的说：“管他在不在家，只要留下买粑粑的钱就行。”可是谁也没有理他。大家又嘀咕了一会，便从带来的米袋子里倒出米来熬稀饭，没有再提买粑粑。雪白的糯米粑引动了拄棍子的食欲，几次来到桌子前看看，但没有动手，只搭讪着的说：“唔，这粑粑大概很甜，搁了白糖哩。”
    在吃着稀饭的时候，矮子忽然想起了什么样的说：“咱们烧了这屋子里的柴火怎么办？”深眉毛抬一下头：“给钱，还有怎么办？又不够一张柴票。”拄棍子的笑起来了，他说：“你找鬼给钱去，老板不在家。”这可难倒了深眉毛，停停才说：“留了钱在这儿，写个字条。”“那么为什么先又不买粑粑？耽搁了咱们许多工夫。”
    话中断了，等到吃完稀饭掏出一张票子，想搁在桌上，忽又觉得不安，怕的别人拿了去。接着，那深眉毛就到处找人，一发现了大五阿公，他很欢喜的把票子交给他说：“老公公，对不起，咱们在这里熬稀饭烧了些柴火，这是一百块柴钱，请你交给老板，咱们是人民解放军。”这一来，太五阿公像吃了一大惊，等到把话完全听懂了，他就感动得说不出话来，嘴巴老是那么张动，只是发不出声音。那捏着票子的两手也拼命抖着；伸长勃子，看着那四个兵走了，然后才自言自说：“这就是共产党的兵嘛？连烧几根柴也要把钱，这是怪事，今年我也活到七十七岁，从来没听说过有这样的兵……他们真是共产党的兵嘛？怪道他们这样找胜仗哩！
    这一天下午，塘底湾那村子里又热闹起来，躲出去的人又很快回到家里，和三嫂一样在那小店子里卖粑粑，生意很好。太五阿公骂她昨天晚上就不该躲，这样的军队到了芷江，那是天开眼，咱们吃苦的日子已到了尽头。他叫她以后不要再听谣言，咱们受苦人有好日子过了。和三嫂也笑着自己骂自己：“昨天晚上，我真是鬼摸了头罗，跟他们乱走，倒耽搁了我一上午的好生意。”
