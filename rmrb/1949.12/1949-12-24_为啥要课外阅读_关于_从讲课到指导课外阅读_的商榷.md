　　Why Extracurricular Reading?
　　A Discussion on "From Lecturing to Guiding Extracurricular Reading"
　　Dong Jieren
　　The article "From Lecturing to Guiding Extracurricular Reading" on the fifth page of the People's Daily on December 14th mentioned that extracurricular reading should revolve around classroom teaching and should be guided, which is very good. But why should there be extracurricular reading? The author takes Chinese language teaching as an example, saying that it is because the content of the textbooks is simple and easy, and extracurricular reading can "enrich the content and improve the quality." Typical examples are the three articles "Receiving Honored Guests," "Lenin and the Blacksmith," and "Little Devils in the Red Army." This view is worth discussing.

　　First, let's see if the content of the textbooks is too simple and easy. Taking "Receiving Honored Guests" as an example, students should understand why peasants love their leaders so much, which is completely different from the "respect" for emperors in the past. Students should understand why Chairman Mao warmly receives peasants, which is completely different from the deception, appeasement, and control of feudal lords in the past. Students should understand some of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policies. Students should understand why a revolutionary leader cannot lead the revolution without learning from the masses; the true meaning of being both a student and a teacher of the masses, etc. Is the understanding of these principles simple and easy for first-year junior high school students?

　　Furthermore, students should see how this story is written, and how issues such as the Hui nationality issue are written. In order to cultivate students' reading and writing abilities, which sentences should be analyzed. Is this simple and easy for first-year junior high school students?

　　In addition to studying in this way, the latter two articles should also be linked to the students' ideological performance to more effectively improve their thinking.

　　The teaching time for each Chinese language article is only two or three hours. It doesn't provide much time to allow students to solve these problems in terms of content and to solve the organization of sentences from a logical and grammatical perspective. If we also "especially emphasize" (and not just "also") introducing the biographies of the authors or the central figures in the textbooks and extracurricular reference materials, it will not only hinder the "clear exposition" of the textbook content but even "searching for chapters and extracting sentences" can only be done on a "chapter-by-chapter, sentence-by-sentence" basis.

　　When teaching the above three Chinese language articles, how can we focus on solving the problems in the textbooks by introducing students to read the books mentioned? And how can we "enrich the content and improve the quality" of the textbooks? The author did not explain. This method, in fact, cannot solve the original problem raised (because students are not interested in Chinese language class, which is why "from lecturing to guiding extracurricular reading" was proposed). Although it will solve another problem - as pointed out in the "ideological and political education in literary reading teaching" cited by the author.

　　Regardless of the author's original intention, readers will think that this means: the Chinese language textbooks themselves will not make students interested. Only by talking about some other materials (although related to the central figures in the textbooks, but not necessarily the focus of this lesson) or extracurricular readings, will students become interested. Teachers should despise the textbooks, not prepare teaching materials well, and use extracurricular reading guidance to replace classroom teaching, reducing the role of class to self-study. As a result, the teaching task will not be completed.

　　Editor's note: Dong Jieren's article is a good and necessary supplement to the other side of the article "From Lecturing to Guiding Extracurricular Reading." The criticisms in the article, such as "despising textbooks... using extracurricular reading guidance to replace classroom teaching, reducing the role of class to self-study..." are still worth discussing. We believe that it is also very important to cultivate students' extracurricular reading ability and interest when teaching Chinese language courses in middle schools.

### 为啥要课外阅读　关于“从讲课到指导课外阅读”的商榷

　　为啥要课外阅读
    关于“从讲课到指导课外阅读”的商榷
    董介人
    十二月十四日人民日报第五版“学校生活”中“从讲课到指导课外阅读”一文，说到课外阅读要围绕着课内教学，要有指导，这是很好的。但是为什么要有课外阅读呢？作者以国文教学为例，说是因为课文的内容简单浅易，课外阅读能使“内容丰富，质量提高”。典型例子是“接待贵客”“列宁和炉匠”“红军中的小鬼们”等三篇，这一观点，却值得商榷。
    首先看课文内容是否太简单浅易呢？按“接待贵客”这篇来说，应该叫学生知道农民为什么这样热爱领袖，这与过去对皇帝的“尊敬”是完全不同的；应该叫学生知道毛主席为什么热诚招待农民，这与过去封建主的欺骗、抚慰、牢拢为什么完全不同；应该叫学生了解些中共的民族政策；应该叫学生知道为什么一个革命领袖不向群众学习就不能领导革命；当群众的学生，又当群众的先生的真实意义等。这些道理的领会，对初中一年级是简单浅易吗？
    再叫学生看这一篇故事是怎样写出的，其中的问题如回民问题是怎样写出的，为了培养学生的阅读和写作能力，应该分析那些句子，这对初中一年级是简单浅易吗？
    后两篇除了也要这样钻研外，还应联系学生的思想表现，更有效的提高学生的思想。
    每篇国文教学时间仅二、三小时，让学生在内容上解决这些问题，从逻辑上和文法上解决章句的组织，时间并不太丰富。如果还要“特别着重”（而不仅只是“还要”）介绍作者或课文内容的中心人物的传记及课外参考材料。那不但会妨碍“清晰的阐述”课文内容，甚至连“寻章摘句”也只能作到“挨章讲句”而已。
    讲上述三篇国文时，介绍学生阅读所提的那些书，怎么才能有重点的解决课文中的问题呢？又怎能使课文“内容丰富质量提高”呢？作者没有说明。这个方法，事实上不能解决原来所提出的问题。（因为学生对国文课没兴趣才提出的“从讲课到指导课外阅读”。）虽然会解决另一个问题——作者引证的“文学阅读教学上的思想政治教育”中所指出的。
    无论作者本意如何，读者会认为这是说：国文课课文本身不会使学生发生兴趣，只有另讲些材料（虽然与课文的中心人物有关系，但不一定是本课的重点。或课外读物，才会使学生发生兴趣。当教员的就要轻视课文，不去好好的准备教学材料，而用课外阅读的指导代替课堂教学，把上课作用降低到自修作用，结果，完不成教学任务。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：董介人这篇文章，作为对“从讲课到指导课外阅读”一文的另一面的补充是很好的，也是必要的，文中所批评的如“轻视课文……用课外阅读的指导代替课堂教学，把上课降低到自修作用……”等，还值得商榷。我们认为：教中级学校的国文课，如何培养学生的课外阅读能力和兴趣，也是很重要的事情。
