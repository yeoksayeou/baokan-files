　　Comrade Stalin—The Great Successor to Lenin's Cause
　　Truth Daily Editorial
　　The great founders of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, Lenin and Stalin, taught us that only a party guided by advanced theory can fulfill the role of an advanced fighter.

　　The Bolshevik Party is powerful and invincible because it is fighting for the realization of communism under the guidance of the most advanced and revolutionary theory—Marxism-Leninism. The strength of Marxist-Leninist theory lies in its ability to enable the party to determine its direction, understand the internal connections of things, foresee the course of events, and not only discern how things are currently developing and in what direction, but also how things will develop in the future.

　　Comrade Stalin, in his historic report at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), particularly emphasized the role and significance of revolutionary theory in all the activities of the Party. Comrade Stalin said: "Our Party knows the direction of development and moves in that direction. Why does our Party have this superior condition? Because it is the party that successfully guides things with Marxism, the party of Leninism. Because its work is guided by the doctrines of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. There is no doubt that as long as we remain loyal to this doctrine and keep this compass in our hands, we will certainly achieve success in our work in the future."

　　Lenin and Stalin, the genius leaders of the working class and the greatest founders of revolutionary science, enriched Marxism, advanced it, and raised it to a new and higher stage.

　　Lenin and Stalin made the most profound Marxist analysis of imperialism as the final stage of capitalism. They proved that in the era of imperialism, the victory of the socialist revolution is possible in a capitalist country where the revolution occurs first and separately. Lenin and Stalin comprehensively developed the doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the doctrine of the leading and guiding role of the party in the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the doctrine of the Soviet system as the best political organizational form in the first transitional stage from capitalism to communism. Lenin and Stalin laid the foundation for the possibility of building a socialist society by the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat surrounded by imperialist countries. They pointed out the unparalleled importance of the worker-peasant alliance in the victorious socialist construction.

　　More than a hundred years have passed since the birth of Marxism. During this period, dozens, even hundreds, of bourgeois governments have tried to eliminate Marxism. The results of their attempts are well known.

　　Comrade Stalin said in 1934: "Bourgeois governments rise and fall, but Marxism still exists. Moreover, Marxism has achieved complete victory on one-sixth of the earth's surface..."

　　Today, nearly 800 million people have been liberated from the shackles of world imperialism. The power of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism is so strong and indestructible.

　　The strength and vitality of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism lie in the fact that their practical actions are based on the needs of the development of society's material life. The broad masses of working people throughout the world are increasingly convinced that capitalism has become an obstacle to the further development of productive forces. At the same time, only when society has undergone socialist transformation can it show broad prospects for the material well-being of the masses and the rapid improvement of culture.

　　Comrade Stalin instructed us that the higher the political level and the Marxist-Leninist understanding of government and party staff members, the more improved and beneficial the work itself will be, and the more effective the results of this work will be.

　　Now that our country is successfully moving towards communism, and the communist education of the working people is of decisive significance, special attention should be paid to the cause of propagating the ideas of Lenin and Stalin. We are educating the broad masses with Marxist-Leninist ideas, and we are precisely using this to accelerate the historical task set by Comrade Stalin—the gradual transition from socialism to communism.

　　"A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" states: "It can be said without exaggeration that after the death of Engels, the greatest theorist Lenin, and after Lenin—Stalin and other students of Lenin, are the only Marxists who have advanced the theory of Marxism, they have enriched Marxist theory with the new experience of the proletariat's class struggle under the new conditions."

　　Comrade Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, has brought exceptionally valuable contributions to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. He creatively developed all aspects of Marxist-Leninist theory. Comrade Stalin comprehensively advanced the doctrine of the Party, expounded the main principles of socialist industrialization of the country, established the theory of agricultural collectivization, and armed the Party and the working class with the most important theoretical instructions on all the fundamental problems of socialist construction. Comrade Stalin further developed Lenin's theory of socialist revolution and reached the conclusion that even when the capitalist encirclement still exists, the construction of communism in our country is possible. Stalin's conclusion advanced Marxism-Leninism a step further, armed the working class with new ideological weapons, and pointed out to the Party a great prospect for winning the victory of communism.

　　Comrade Stalin scientifically promoted the great experience of the Soviet state and created a complete and perfect doctrine of the socialist state.

　　Stalin's genius, with the brilliance of Marxist-Leninist theory, illuminates our country's road of gradual transition from socialism to communism, and points out the new laws and new dynamics of Soviet socialist society. Comrade Stalin, the greatest theorist of communism, comprehensively and profoundly developed the problems of the international communist movement. He generalized the rich experience of the liberation struggle of the proletariat in capitalist countries and the national liberation struggle of oppressed nations in colonial and semi-colonial countries during the period of the general crisis of capitalism. Comrade Stalin's works are an inexhaustible source of strategic and tactical guidance for communist parties and workers' parties in various countries.

　　Lenin-Stalin's thought is a great mobilizing force, organizational force, and reforming force. Under the banner of this thought, the working class, in alliance with the working masses of peasants, eliminated capitalism in our country and built a socialist society. Under the banner of Lenin and Stalin's thought, the Soviet people won a victory of worldwide historical significance in the Great Patriotic War. Under this invincible banner, our people have achieved new successes in the development of socialist economy and culture and in the further consolidation of the power of the Soviet state in the post-war period.

　　The great Lenin-Stalin thought lives and triumphs in the international workers' movement. The ever-victorious power of this thought is brilliantly manifested in the achievements of socialist construction in the people's democratic countries, in the historically significant victory of the Chinese people, and also in the growing and consolidating movement for peace, democracy, and freedom.

　　The rabid camp of the doomed imperialist reactionaries is doing its utmost, with all its material and spiritual forces, to hinder the road of Marxist-Leninist doctrine from reaching the broad working masses in capitalist countries. But these attempts are in vain! Historical experience tells us that new social ideas, generated on the basis of the mature conditions of the development of society's material life, will break through all the obstacles set up by the dying reactionary classes and open up a road for themselves to move forward.

　　Comrade Stalin, the greatest theorist of Marxism-Leninism, illuminates the road to a better future for the working people of all countries—the road to communism—with the torch of his genius. The name of Stalin, surrounded by the people's deep love and respect, signifies the greatness and strength of the Soviet Union and the Bolshevik Party, and signifies the ideological power of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism.

　　Millions of people around the world are preparing to celebrate Stalin's seventieth birthday, expressing their respect and admiration for this great leader and thinker of the working class, the genius successor to Lenin's cause, and the triumphant inspirer and organizer of communist construction.

　　The working people of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have launched a large-scale socialist competition to commemorate Comrade Stalin's seventieth birthday. Meetings of workers, peasants, and advanced intellectuals are being held everywhere, expressing the working people's infinite love for Stalin.

　　Millions of working people in various countries see Stalin as their leader and mentor, and in his creations, they learn the art of striving for the victory of peace, democracy, and socialism, and learn how to build a new and happy life.

　　Under the leadership of the genius leader Stalin, the Soviet people are moving forward, moving towards the victory of communism, moving towards the victory of communism.

　　斯大林同志——列宁事业的伟大继承者
　  真理报社论
    布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家的伟大奠基者列宁和斯大林教导我们说：只有先进的理论指导之下的党，才能完成先进战士的作用。
    布尔什维克党之所以强有力而不可战胜，就因为它是在最先进的最富革命性的理论——马列主义指导之下为实现共产主义而奋斗。马列主义理论的力量，在于它使党能够确定方向，能够了解事物的内在联系，预见事物的进程，同时不仅能辨别事物在目前如何发展和朝什么方向发展，而且还能看出事物在将来如何发展和朝什么方向发展。
    斯大林同志在联共（布）第十七次大会上的历史性的报告中，曾特别强调革命的理论在党的一切活动中的作用和意义。斯大林同志说：“我们的党知道事物的发展方向，并循着这个方向前进。我们党为什么有这种优越条件呢？就因为它是以马克思主义成功地引导事物的党，是列宁主义的党。就因为它的工作是以马克思、恩格斯和列宁的学说为指南。毫无疑义，只要我们始终忠实于这个学说，只要我们始终把握着这个指南针，那我们今后在自己工作中一定会有成就的。”
    工人阶级的天才领袖、革命科学的最伟大奠立者列宁和斯大林，丰富了马克思主义，向前推进了它，并把它提高到新的高级的阶段。
    列宁和斯大林对于作为资本主义最后阶段的帝国主义加以最深刻的马克思主义分析，他们证明：在帝国主义时代，社会主义革命在一个首先单独发生革命的资本主义国家中获得胜利是可能的。列宁和斯大林全面地发展了关于无产阶级专政的学说，关于党在无产阶级专政的制度中的领导作用和指导作用的学说，关于作为从资本主义到共产主义第一个过渡阶段的社会里最好的政治组织形式的苏维埃制度的学说。列宁和斯大林奠立了在帝国主义国家包围之下无产阶级专政国家建设社会主义社会之可能性的基础，他们指出了工农联盟在胜利的社会主义建设中的无比重要性。
    马克思主义诞生至今已一百多年了。在这期间，数十个、数百个的资产阶级政府，都曾尝试着消灭马克思主义。他们这些尝试的结果，是众所周知的。
    斯大林同志在一九三四年曾说：“资产阶级政府登台又垮台，而马克思主义仍然存在着。而且，马克思主义已在全球六分之一的地面上获得了完全胜利，……”
    今天，将近八亿人民已从世界帝国主义的枷锁中解放了出来。马克思主义——列宁主义——斯大林主义的力量是如此地强有力和无坚不摧。
    马克思主义——列宁主义——斯大林主义的力量与活力，正在于它们的实际行动是依据社会物质生活发展之需要的。全世界广大的劳动群众，愈来愈确信：资本主义已成为生产力进一步发展的阻碍。同时只有在社会经过了社会主义的改造时，才能给群众的物质幸福和文化的迅速提高，显示出广阔的远景。
    斯大林同志指示我们：政府和党的各部门工作人员的政治水平和马列主义领悟程度愈加提高，那么工作的本身就会更提高，更有益，同时这个工作的成果也就会更有效。
    现在，当我们国家成功地迈向共产主义、劳动人民的共产主义教育具有决定性的意义的时候，对列宁和斯大林思想的宣传事业尤其需要特别重视。我们以马列思想来教育广大群众，我们正是以此来加速这个由斯大林同志所规定的历史任务——从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的任务。
    “联共（布）党史简明教程”中说道：“可以毫不夸张地说，恩格斯去世后，最伟大的理论家列宁，而在列宁之后——斯大林和其他列宁的学生们，乃是仅有的这样的马克思主义者，他们把马克思主义的理论向前推进了一步，他们以无产阶级在新条件下的阶级斗争的新经验丰富了马克思主义理论。”
    列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林同志，给马列主义宝库带来了异常珍贵的贡献，他创造性地发展了马列主义理论的一切问题。斯大林同志全面地推进了关于党的学说，阐扬了国家的社会主义工业化的主要原则，建立了农业集体化的理论，并且以关于社会主义建设的一切基本问题的最重要的理论指示，武装了党和工人阶级。斯大林同志进一步发展了列宁的社会主义革命的理论，并得出了这个结论：即使资本主义的包围还存在的时候，我国的共产主义建设也是可能实现的。斯大林的这个结论把马列主义向前推进了一步，以新的思想武器武装了工人阶级，给党指出争取共产主义胜利的一个伟大远景。
    斯大林同志科学地推广了苏维埃国家的巨大经验，创造了完整的和完善的社会主义国家的学说。
    斯大林的天才，以马列主义理论的光辉，照亮了我国由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的道路，指出了苏维埃社会主义社会的新规律和新动力。共产主义最伟大的理论家斯大林同志全面而深刻地发展了国际共产主义运动的问题。他普遍化了资本主义总危机时期内资本主义国家无产阶级的解放斗争和殖民地半殖民地被压迫民族的民族解放斗争的丰富经验。斯大林同志的著作，是各国共产党与工人党的战略与策略指南的无尽泉源。
    列宁——斯大林的思想，是伟大的动员力量、组织力量和改革力量。在这个思想的旗帜下，工人阶级在和农民劳动群众的联盟中，消灭了我国的资本主义，并建设了社会主义社会。在列宁、斯大林的思想旗帜下，苏联人民在伟大的卫国战争中获得了具有全世界历史意义的胜利。在这个所向无敌的旗帜下，我国人民在战后时期，在社会主义经济和文化的发展上，在进一步巩固苏维埃国家的威力上，都达到新的成就。
    伟大的列宁——斯大林思想，在国际工人运动中生存着，战胜着。这种思想的常胜力量，光辉地表现在人民民主国家社会主义建设的成就中，表现在中国人民的具有历史意义的胜利中，也表现在增长着、巩固着的争取和平、民主和自由的运动中。
    命定灭亡的帝国主义反动派的狂暴阵营，尽其一切物质力量与精神力量，以阻碍马列主义学说传入资本主义国家广大劳动群众中去的道路。但是这些企图是白费的！历史的经验告诉我们：在社会物质生活发展条件成熟的基础上所产生的新的社会思想，是会冲破垂死的反动阶级所设置的一切障碍，而为自己开拓向前挺进的道路的。
    马列主义最伟大的理论家斯大林同志，以自己天才的火炬，给各国劳动者照亮着迈向更好的未来的道路——迈向共产主义的道路。被人民的深爱和尊敬围绕着的斯大林的名字，表明着苏联和布尔什维克党的伟大和力量。表明着马克思主义——列宁主义——斯大林主义的思想力量。
    全世界千百万人民正准备庆祝斯大林的七十岁寿辰，对于这位工人阶级的伟大领袖和思想家，列宁事业的天才继承者，共产主义建设凯旋的鼓舞者和组织者，表示尊崇的敬意。
    苏联和人民民主国家的劳动人民，展开了大规模的社会主义竞赛，以纪念斯大林同志的七十寿辰。工人、农民和先进的知识分子的集会到处举行着。表示出劳动人民对斯大林的无限爱戴。
    各国的数以百万计的劳动人民，在斯大林身上，看见了自己的领袖和导师，在他的创作中，他们学习着争取和平、民主和社会主义事业胜利的艺术，学习着建设新的幸福的生活。
    苏联人民在天才领袖斯大林领导下向前迈进，向共产主义的胜利迈进，向共产主义的胜利迈进。
