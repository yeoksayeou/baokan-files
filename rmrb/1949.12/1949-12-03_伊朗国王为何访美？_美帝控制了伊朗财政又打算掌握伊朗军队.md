Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th (via TASS, Moscow, December 28th): Today's Pravda, in a prominent position, published the second part of an international commentary, commenting on the Iranian King's visit to the United States. It stated that the American masters are attempting to conceal the aggressive nature of their talks with their Iranian guest behind a smokescreen of verbal "love of peace." The opinions expressed frankly by some American newspapers have dispelled this smokescreen. The U.S. State Department announced that the Iranian King's visit was a "goodwill mission," but the New York Herald Tribune shamelessly commented on this announcement: In our time, this means he is trying to get two things—weapons and money. The Iranian King confirmed at a press conference that he and Truman had discussed the issue of U.S. military aid to Iran to prevent "Communist expansion into the Middle East." The Herald Tribune insisted that during the talks, the Iranian King had discussed the reorganization of the Iranian army with representatives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with American "help."

Pravda continued, stating that with the Iranian King's visit to the United States, the attention of capitalist newspapers has once again focused on the competition between Britain and the United States in Iran. Under the pressure of a stronger and more aggressive American competitor, British imperialism is forced to hand over one foothold after another. Shortly after the war, the United States forced Britain to "give" them a quarter of the shares of the British-Iranian Oil Company. American "advisors" have controlled Iran's financial power. The American military mission commands the Iranian army and gendarmerie. But are the Iranian people willing to be tools of imperialist aggression, willing to be cannon fodder in a war planned for the profits of Wall Street? Iran's progressive and patriotic forces are increasingly determined to take up arms to defend the national interests of the Iranian people, oppose the enslavement of Iran by foreign capital, and prevent Iran from becoming a springboard for British and American imperialists.

　　伊朗国王为何访美？
  　美帝控制了伊朗财政又打算掌握伊朗军队
    【新华社北京三十日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：今日真理报以显要地位刊载的国际述评第二部分中评论伊朗国王访美称，美国主子正企图用口头上“爱好和平”的烟雾来掩饰他们与伊朗宾客会谈的侵略性质。美国一些报纸所露骨地表示的意见已驱散这一烟雾。美国国务院宣布伊朗国王的访问是“亲善使命”，但纽约先驱论坛在评论这一宣布时无耻地说：在我们的时代这意味着他正试图得到两件东西——武器和金钱。伊朗国王在记者招待会上证实：他和杜鲁门曾经讨论美国给伊朗军事援助以阻止“共产主义扩张到中东”的问题。先驱论坛报力称在会谈时，伊朗国王曾与联合参谋部的代表讨论在美国“帮助”下改组伊朗军队的问题。
    真理报继称，随着伊朗国王的访美，资本主义报纸的注意力，再度集中在英美在伊朗的竞争上。在更强大的和更具侵略性的美国竞争者的压力下，英国帝国主义被迫交出一个又一个的据点。战后不久，美国即强迫英国把英商英伊石油公司股份的四分之一“让”给他们。美国“顾问”已控制了伊朗的财政权。美国军事使团指挥着伊朗军队和宪兵。但是伊朗人民是否愿当帝国主义侵略的工具，愿意在为了华尔街的利润计划着的战争中当炮灰呢？伊朗的进步和爱国力量正愈来愈坚决地拿起武器，保卫伊朗人民的民族利益，反对外国资本奴役伊朗及变伊朗为英美帝国主义者的跳板。
