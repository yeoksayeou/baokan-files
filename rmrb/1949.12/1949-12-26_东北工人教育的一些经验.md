　　Some Experiences in Workers' Education in Northeast China
　　By Our Correspondent in Northeast China, Yao Fu
　　Main Experiences of the Past Three Years
　　To run regular spare-time schools well, long-term planning is necessary to establish a school system.
　　To run regular spare-time schools well, long-term planning, a certain school system and regulations, class assignments according to level, and steady progress are necessary to enable workers to master systematic scientific and cultural knowledge. This is the main experience of Northeast China in running workers' education in the past three years. Students of the Tiexi District United Evening School in Shenyang and the May First Factory Evening School improved their general literacy and arithmetic skills to the level of first grade in elementary school after studying for three months, and it is estimated that they can reach the level of elementary school graduation within one year. However, some factories and mines in certain areas still adopt the "one-size-fits-all" teaching method, which has little effect and remains in a state of "monkey turning into human," "listening to a point for an hour," temporary and chaotic, and intermittent. This has affected the workers' enthusiasm for learning.
　　Methods to Consolidate Evening Schools: Everyone Runs Evening Schools, Integrating Learning with Application
　　Mobilizing "everyone to run evening schools" is a good way to consolidate evening schools and overcome difficulties. Repeated experience has shown that it is relatively easy to mobilize workers to enroll in schools after the leadership calls for it, but it is very difficult to consolidate and persevere. The experience of Dalian is to find the "crux of the matter," first launch a "literacy complaint" movement to concentrate many losses and deceptions among the illiterate masses to educate workers; and then encourage everyone to study through entertainment evenings, dramas, acrobatics, and other forms. When the masses are voluntarily mobilized and participate in learning, the leaders of learning pay great attention to consolidating the learning enthusiasm of students, understanding the difficulties of illiterate people in learning culture, and actively solving all specific problems, such as helping with writing strokes and helping with recognition. Further, it is important to grasp the link of developing achievements and consolidating achievements—the best way is to use the method of "integrating learning with application," teaching bookkeeping, writing diaries, writing newsletters, and reading popular reading materials; holding "recollection and chat meetings" on the literacy front line; and rewarding those who make rapid progress to motivate the backward, so that they can persevere. Harbin mobilized workers to enroll by combining mobilization through trade union organizations with universal registration of illiterates and enrollment, so that they felt that they were learning for themselves; and they elected their own group leaders, formulated their own discipline and learning covenants, which everyone could abide by together, overcoming the problems of being late and leaving early. The method of the Tiexi District United Evening School in Shenyang is to teach the existing students well and use the students' own living achievements to mobilize students. When the school started in August this year, there were only 70 or 80 students, and the students' enthusiasm was not high. Soon, the benefits of learning became apparent, and the enthusiasm changed. Then, fathers brought sons, husbands called wives, brothers mobilized sisters, and masters mobilized apprentices to come to the evening school together. Now there are 287 students. All the workers automatically repaired the school building, made tables, chairs, and blackboards, and helped to select teachers and borrow classrooms, overcoming various difficulties.
　　Utilizing Three Forms to Organize Technical Learning
　　Flexible organizational forms and suitable learning times cannot be ignored. Large factories and mines can organize evening schools with the factory as a unit. For areas where residences are scattered, factories are small, and there are few workers, it is best to organize joint evening schools in the workers' residential areas. The 35 joint regular evening schools in Harbin are composed of workers from public and private enterprises, which can solve the difficulty of teacher shortage. The best way to learn technology is to focus on the factory as a unit. The Northeast mainly conducts it in three forms: (1) Learning while doing. For example, the Shenyang Railway Factory uses the method of signing teacher-student teaching contracts to strengthen technology. This method is now being vigorously promoted in various parts of the Northeast and will form a movement. (2) Organizing amateur technical research groups in a freely combined manner, encouraging research, and the leadership providing various conveniences. (3) Establishing technical schools with the factory as a unit, focusing on absorbing workers with higher elementary school education to participate. In the new record movement, there have been new developments recently. The Andong Paper Mill has adopted the method of dividing groups by workshop and combining cultural learning with technical learning, learning what is done, so that learning is combined with work. As for the learning time, the Xi'an Coal Mine initially had one hour of learning after work, but everyone could not persist. Later, it was changed to arriving at work one hour before work, learning and then working, and the attendance rate increased from 20% to 90%.
　　Another factor in running a good regular spare-time school is to have enough fixed teachers, unified teaching materials suitable for workers' tastes, and new teaching methods. Cultural teachers and technical teachers in various workers' spare-time schools in Northeast China are mainly self-sufficient in principle. The main sources are: (1) local primary and secondary school teachers; (2) staff who are enthusiastic about helping workers learn; (3) workers with high cultural or technical skills. In addition, we must make good use of all usable forces. In addition to sending cadres from the trade union's cultural and educational department to directly help, we also absorb cadres from government organs and students on vacation as short-term volunteer teachers. Fixed teachers should be given certain subsidies. As for the issue of teaching materials, it is currently being actively resolved. Harbin, Dalian, and other places have compiled workers' textbooks. The Northeast established a "Workers' Reading Material Compilation and Review Committee" to compile workers' textbooks first. The first and second volumes of the elementary level have been published, and the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth volumes have been compiled and reviewed.
　　Difficulties with Workers' Teaching Materials Solved Uniformly Throughout the Region
　　In order to further close the relationship between workers and teachers, various places have held teacher-student get-togethers. To make up for the lack of experience of teachers, Harbin held a meeting of teacher representatives to exchange experiences, promote the "three meetings" method of teaching students to speak, think, and do, and promote more review, which are all good methods.
　　Workers' regular evening schools should be led uniformly by the local Federation of Trade Unions and supported by the government. Recently, in order to strengthen workers' education, various industrial cities in Northeast China have established workers' education committees to uniformly solve the issues of workers' education policies, plans, teaching materials, teachers, funding, housing, and time.
　　In addition, in order to cooperate with workers' education, we will continue to hold larger-scale employee clubs and small libraries with the factory as a unit in the future, and strive to create a learning environment to help workers learn.

　　东北工人教育的一些经验
    本报驻东北记者  药夫
    三年来的主要经验
    办好正规业余学校，必须长期打算，确立学制。
    要办好正规业余学校，就要长期打算，有一定的学制与制度，按程度编班，踏踏实实的一步步前进，使工人掌握系统的科学文化知识，这是东北三年来举办工人教育的主要经验。沈阳铁西区联合夜校与五一工厂夜校的学员学习了三个月，一般文盲的国语，算术都提高到小学一年级程度，估计一年内可达到初小毕业水平。但某些地区的厂矿仍采取“一揽子”教学方法，收效甚微，长期停留在“猴子变人”，“听不听一点钟”，临时乱抓，时作时辍的状态，因此影响了工人学习情绪。
    巩固夜样方法：大家办夜样学与用一致
    发动“大家办夜校”是巩固夜校，克服困难的好办法。多次经验证明：当领导上号召之后，动员工人入校是比较容易的，但巩固与坚持下去就十分困难。大连的经验是找“节骨眼”，首先开展“文盲诉苦”运动，把分散在文盲群众中的许多吃亏上当的事情集中起来教育工人；又通过娱乐晚会、戏剧、杂耍等形式，鼓励大家学习；群众自愿的动起来了，参加学习之后，这时学习领导者又十分注意巩固学员学习情绪，体贴文盲学文化的困难，主动解决一切具体问题，如一笔一划的帮助写，帮助认等等。进一步便抓住发展成绩与巩固成绩的环节——最好是用“学与用一致”的方法，教给记帐、作日记、写通讯、看通俗读物；召开识字前线的“回忆漫谈会”；奖励进步快的带动落后，使之坚持不懈。哈尔滨动员工人入学，采取了通过工会组织进行动员，普遍登记文盲与招生相结合的办法，使他们感到是为自己学习；并由自己选举小组长等，自己订纪律、订学习公约，大家都能共同遵守，克服迟到早退的毛病。沈阳铁西区联合夜校的办法，是教好现有学生，用学生自己的活的成绩去动员学生。今年八月开始时，该校仅有学生七八十名，学生的情绪也不高；不久，学习的好处表现出来，情绪转变了，于是父亲带儿子，丈夫叫妻子，哥哥动员妹子，师傅动员徒弟，一齐到夜校来，现学生已达二八七名。全体工友自动修理校室，做桌凳、黑板，自己帮助选择教员，借教室等，克服了种种困难。
    利用三种形式组织技术学习
    灵活的组织形式与适宜的学习时间是不能忽视的。各大厂矿，可以本厂为单位组织夜校。对于住地分散，工厂较小，工人少的地区，最好在工人住区组织联合夜校。哈尔滨的三十五处联合正规夜校，就是吸收公、私企业工人参加组成的，这样可以解决教员缺少的困难。技术学习最好的以厂为单位，有重点的去办。东北主要通过三种形式来进行：（一）边做边学。如沈阳铁路工厂用订立师徒教学合同的方法，来加强技术。现东北各地正大力推广这种方法，将形成运动。（二）以自由结合的方式，组织业余技术研究组，鼓励钻研，领导上给以各种方便。（三）以工厂为单位，有重点的办技术学校，吸收高小文化程度的工人参加。在新纪录运动中，最近又有新的发展，安东造纸厂采取了按车间编小组，文化学习与技术学习结合的办法，作什么学什么，使学习与工作结合起来。学习的时间，西安煤矿起初是不班后学习一小时，大家不能坚持，后改为上班前一点到班，学习后再工作，出席率由百分之二十提高到百分之九十。
    办好正规化业余学校的另一因素，是要有足够的固定的教员，统一的适合工人口味的教材和新的教学方法。东北各工人业余学校，文化教员与技术教员都是以自己解决为原则，主要来源是：（一）本地中小学教员；（二）热心帮助工友学习的职员；（三）文化程度高或技术高的工人。此外，还要好好使用一切可以使用的力量，除工会文教部派干部直接帮助外，还吸收机关干部，与假期中的学生作短期义务教员。固定的教员应给予一定的津贴。至于教材问题，目前正在积极解决，哈尔滨、大连等地已编写了工人课本，东北成立了“工人读物编审委员会”，首先编写工人课本，现初级一、二册已出版，三、四、五、六册已编审告竣。
    工人教材困难全区统一解决
    为进一步密切工人与教员的关系，各地曾举行师生联欢会。为弥补教员经验之不足，哈尔滨曾召开了教员代表会，交流经验，提倡教学员会说、会想、会做的“三会”方法，并提倡多复习等，都是很好的办法。
    工人正规夜校应由地方总工会统一领导，取得政府支持。东北各地最近为加强工人教育，各工业城市成立工人教育委员会，统一解决工人教育方针、计划与教材、教员、经费、房子、时间等问题。
    此外，为了配合工人教育，今后将继续举办规模较大的职工俱乐部和以厂为单位的小型图书馆，努力创造学习环境，以帮助工人学习。
