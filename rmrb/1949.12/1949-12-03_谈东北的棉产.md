　　Talking About Cotton Production in Northeast China
    Lin Shan
  　I. Planting Area
    The Northeast is known for its abundance. On the one hand, it has a surplus of grain, but on the other hand, it lacks a lot of cotton yarn and cloth. One ton of grain can only be exchanged for one bolt of cloth. Insufficient cotton production has always been a problem in the Northeast. According to the usual standard calculation, an average person's clothing, bedding, and necessary production materials require more than seventeen square yards of fabric. The population of over 40 million in Northeast China needs 80 million square yards of fabric, equivalent to approximately 1.8 million dan (100 catties) of seed cotton. At an average yield of 26 catties per small mu (Guannei [area south of Shanhaiguan] city mu) in Northeast China, it is necessary to develop to 7 million small mu, equivalent to over 4.7 million large mu (Northeast new mu). The area suitable for cotton planting in Northeast China is estimated to be 5 million mu (7.5 million small mu). In 1945, it had developed to 2.2 million mu (3.3 million small mu). The frost-free period in the Northeast cotton area is 170 days, shorter than the 200 days in the Pingjin [Beijing-Tianjin] area. However, the temperature is quite high during the vigorous growth period of June, July, and August. During the flowering and boll-opening period of August, September, and October, the sunshine is long and there are many sunny days, which makes cotton grow and mature faster than in Guannei. It is also very suitable for planting early-maturing varieties such as "Guannong No. 1." The average yield per small mu in the country has been about 25 catties over the years, about 30 catties in Hebei and Shaanxi, and about 27 catties in Northeast China, which is comparable to Henan and Shandong. Based on this situation, the Northeast should develop cotton planting. However, it is generally believed that the Northeast is too cold and not suitable for cotton planting, and that it is better to grow more grain to exchange for cotton from North China. But the fact is not so. Although the cotton production in the Northeast is not as good as that in North China, the output is not small. In the Northeast, cotton farmers are satisfied with exchanging 15 catties of sorghum for 1 catty of cotton. If it is transported from Guannei, it will cost more than 15 catties of sorghum. In terms of the national cotton supply and demand, the country currently has 4.5 million spindles, requiring 10 million dan of seed cotton, plus another 5 million dan for other needs. Last year, only 40 million small mu were planted with cotton, producing only 10 million dan of cotton. The shortage of several million dan needs to be supplemented by a large amount of American cotton yarn and cloth. Now, some factories in the Northeast are shut down due to lack of raw materials, and even factories in Tianjin can only operate at half capacity. China has never had enough cotton and must develop rapidly to solve the cotton needs of the Northeast. If we rely entirely on foreign cotton yarn, it is neither possible nor should be done. Therefore, it is a definite task to restore and develop the cotton production industry in Northeast China as quickly as possible. This year, due to the limited cotton seeds, we can only restore to 100,000 hectares (equivalent to 1.5 million small mu), which can yield more than 300,000 dan of seed cotton. By the next year and the year after, we can gradually expand to 300,000 hectares (4.5 million small mu).
    II. Cotton Planting Technology
    The main technical problems are variety improvement and pest control.
    The main cotton variety in the Northeast is Guannong No. 1, which is widely promoted south of Liaoyang. This variety belongs to the improved King Cotton system of American cotton. It was introduced from Korea and selected by the Guandong Agricultural Experiment Station, hence the name Guannong No. 1. It matures one week earlier than the original variety, and the yield and cotton quality are also better. It is suitable for spinning 16-20 count cotton yarn and is suitable for planting south of Liaoyang. In the colder cotton areas north of Liaoyang, up to Zhengjiatun and Taonan, there is "Liaoyang No. 1." This variety is a white-seeded cotton system from Zhengjiatun and was selected by the Liaoyang Cotton Farm. It matures earlier than "Guannong No. 1," and the cotton fiber is fine and long, capable of spinning 32 count yarn, but the yield is low. In addition, there are some remaining degraded American cotton varieties, belonging to the King Cotton or Tuozi Cotton system, introduced from Korea or eastern Hebei. The yield and quality are slightly worse than "Guannong No. 1," but they are still barely suitable for the cotton area south of Liaoyang. The cotton seeds transported from eastern Hebei this year are also this type of cotton seed, which can be used temporarily when cotton seeds are scarce. There are also some local varieties of upland cotton that have been handed down, but the quality and yield are very poor. The future ways to improve cotton varieties in the Northeast are: (1) Select earlier-maturing varieties from "Guannong No. 1" and promote them further north. (2) Use "Guannong No. 1" as a base and cross it with other long-staple American cotton varieties such as Si Zi Cotton to breed early-maturing long-staple cotton seeds to meet the needs of spinning 30 count or higher fine yarn. (3) Collect excellent materials to breed insect-resistant varieties. The current promotion is to utilize various cotton seeds in a planned way, limit the foreign seeds to a certain range, keep the original "Guannong No. 1" alone in one area, designate at least one district in each county, and then set up specially contracted seed-retaining cotton fields of more than 100 mu in each district to restore "Guannong No. 1" or "Liaoyang No. 1" to purity, in order to gradually eliminate foreign varieties and replace the mixed and degraded improved varieties. After three years, the planting area of Guannong No. 1 and Liaoyang No. 1 can be restored. After five years, all can be purified. After eight years, more excellent varieties will be developed.
    Pest control is the key to the success or failure of cotton planting in the Northeast. Cotton pests and diseases occur commonly throughout the country, but they are particularly serious in the Northeast because the cotton growing season in the Northeast is very short. If cotton seedlings suffer from pests, they do not have time to recover to health in order to complete boll-opening before frost. In the past, cotton in the Northeast developed very rapidly, and successful pest control was also a factor. A large amount of derris root was transported from Southeast Asia and Taiwan to make derris powder, and sulfur was transported from Japan. Hundreds of thousands of sprayers were equipped, and hundreds of thousands of cotton farmers were guided to become familiar with pest control techniques. This foundation is not available in other cotton areas in the country. But today, the sources of derris root and sulfur are difficult, and the replenishment of sprayers cannot be solved quickly. Now, in addition to using the remaining derris root to make derris powder, tobacco water, soybean oil emulsion, and flour paste can be used to solve the problem (but there are difficulties in terms of effectiveness and promotion). We are also preparing to promote the planting of yellow flower tobacco (small leaf tobacco) to make nicotine sulfate, and to use the industrial and mining conditions in the Northeast to manufacture synthetic pesticides such as DDT and 666. This is a complex technical problem.
    III. Business Operations and Management
    Cotton has its own special characteristics compared to ordinary agricultural products. Cotton production is purely an industrial raw material and a commodity that occupies an important position in the market. Moreover, cotton cultivation is a relatively sophisticated and technical operation. Therefore, the operation of the cotton industry must strengthen the planning of relevant businesses and organize extensive mutual assistance and cooperation among cotton farmers in order to facilitate development.
    The first is the issue of cotton prices. If growing cotton is not more profitable than growing other crops, no matter how good the cotton seed yield and quality are, and no matter how good the pest control methods and cultivation techniques are, farmers will not grow more cotton. The saying that cotton farmers in the Northeast have circulated: "One bundle (ten catties) of cotton for three dou (forty-five catties) of grain (sorghum)" and "One mu of cotton (about twenty-six catties) for two mu of land (three hundred and sixty catties of grain)." Based on past data and current survey results, the results are similar. Five catties of sorghum for one catty of seed cotton (large flower seed) is suitable for the general situation in the Northeast. The current price of exchanging one catty of lint cotton for fourteen to seventeen catties of sorghum has played a significant role in the rapid promotion of cotton planting this year. When we examine the history of the rise and fall of cotton areas in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the past, the ratio of cotton prices is very important. Analyzing from the price of cloth, control and plunder were more than commercial profits, commercial profits were more than industrial profits, and industrial profits were more than agricultural income. In fact, industry and agriculture were losing money, which seriously affected the shortage of cotton sources. It is urgent to increase agricultural profits in order to develop production as a whole. However, bureaucratic capital, on the contrary, relied on American cotton as a backing and desperately strengthened control and plunder. This is why the cotton price issue could not be resolved in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the past and became a fundamental obstacle to the development of the cotton industry. Only today's New Democratic economy can solve this long-standing problem in the cotton industry.
    In terms of business management, enterprise-based management has a great role to play. However, we cannot establish a new and complete cotton industry management system at the moment. We will temporarily divide this complete work into various relevant system departments to be responsible for separately. Although it can also solve many major problems such as cotton price advance purchases, loans, and adjustment of cotton seeds, many specific tasks have not been quickly and completely implemented, such as the management and construction of ginning mills, the selection and distribution of cotton seeds, the grading of pricing and inspection, the cooperative organization of promotion, and the allocation of pesticide sprayers. There are some unreasonable and unscientific waste and disconnection phenomena. This will more or less affect the development of the cotton industry in the Northeast. Organizations should be improved as soon as possible to organize hundreds of thousands of cotton households and turn them into a strong cooperative economic force to accelerate the development of cotton production in the Northeast and solve the long-standing problem of insufficient cotton sources in the Northeast.

　　谈东北的棉产
    林山
  　一、种植面积
    东北素称富饶，一方面剩余大量的粮食，而另一方面却缺少很多花纱布，一吨粮食只换一匹布。棉产不足是东北历来存在的问题。通常标准推算，一个人的衣被用品以及需要配合的生产资材，平均要十七平方码以上的布料，东北四千多万人口要八万平方码的布料，折合约一百八十万担（百斤）皮棉，以东北平均每小亩（关内市亩）产二十六斤计算需要发展到七百万小亩，合大亩（东北新亩）四百七十多万亩。东北纺织能力，伪满原有五十六万锭，最近可能恢复到四十万锭，每锭平均年可纺花两担二十斤，共需八十八万担，可产棉布七百多万匹，每人可摊十七尺；另加其他需要的棉花一人半斤，计一百多万担，共需植棉四百万小亩，合大亩二百七十万亩。东北适宜植棉的地区，估计有五百万亩（七百五十万小亩）。一九四五年曾发展到过二百二十万亩（三百三十万小亩）。东北棉区无霜期一百七十日，比平津二百天为短，在生育茂盛期的六、七、八月间温度相当高，在开花吐絮期八、九、十月间日照长而晴日多，对于棉花的生长与成熟比关内迅速，较种植早熟性的品种，如“关农一号”亦甚适宜。历年全国平均每小亩产量约二十五斤，河北陕西约三十斤，东北约二十七斤，与河南山东相当。根据这一情况，东北应发展植棉。但一般都认为东北天气冷不宜植棉，以为大可多种粮食来换华北的棉花，而事实并不如此，东北产棉虽不及华北，所产不多。但在东北以十五斤高粱换一斤棉花，棉农就满足，要从关里运来，得化比十五斤高粱更多的代价。就全中国的棉产供需上来说，全国现有四百五十万纺绽，需一千万担皮棉，另外其他尚需要五百多万担。去年植棉不过四千万小亩，产棉仅一千多万担，其不足之数百万担，要靠大量的美棉纱布来补充。现在东北的纱厂有因无原料而停工的，即天津的纱厂亦只能半开工。历来中国棉花就不够，必须迅速发展才能解决东北用棉。如果全靠外来棉纱，既不可能，也不应该，因此尽可能迅速恢复与发展东北棉产事业，是确定任务。今年因为棉籽有限，只能恢复到十万垧（合一百五十万小亩），可收皮棉三十万担以上。至明后年可逐步扩大到三十万垧（四百五十万小亩）。
    二、植棉技术
    技术问题，主要是品种改良与防治病虫害。
    东北的棉种主要是关农一号，在辽阳以南普遍推广。此品种是属美棉中改良金字棉的系统，自朝鲜传入，经关东农事试验场选出，故名关农一号，比原种早熟一周，产量棉质也较优良，适合纺十六至二十支棉纱，适宜在辽阳以南种埴。在辽阳之北以至郑家屯洮南一带较寒冷的棉区，有“辽阳一号”，此品种是郑家屯白籽中棉系统，经辽阳棉作场选出，成熟比“关农一号”更早，棉绒细长，能纺三十二支，产量少。此外还残存一些退化美棉，属金字棉或脱字棉系统，经朝鲜或冀东传入，产量与质量比“关农一号”差些，还勉强适合辽阳以南棉区，今年自冀东运入棉籽也是这一类棉种，可在棉籽缺乏时暂为利用。还有一些当地留传下来的各种中棉，品质与产量都很差，今后改良东北棉种的途径：（１）从“关农一号”中，选更早熟品种，往北推广。（２）以“关农一号”为基础，与其他长绒美棉如斯字棉等杂交，育成早熟长绒棉种，使适合纺三十支以上细纱的需要。（３）收罗优良材料，育成抗虫品种。目前的推广是有计划的利用各种棉种，把外来种籽限止在一定的范围，把原有的“关农一号”单独保持在一个地区，每县至少特定一个区，再就每区设置一百亩以上的特约留种棉田，把“关农一号”或“辽阳一号”恢复纯净，以逐步淘汰外来品种与代替混杂退化了的良种。三年之后就可以恢复关农一号与辽阳一号的播种面积，五年之后可以全部纯化，八年之后将有更优良的品种发展起来。
    防治虫害是东北植棉成败的关键，棉作病虫害在全国各地都普遍发生，但在东北特别严重；因为东北棉花生长期间很短，如果棉苗遭受了虫害便没有时间来恢复健康以完成霜前吐絮。过去东北棉花发展得很快，治虫得力亦其因素，从南洋台湾运入大量的鱼藤根制成地力斯石硷，从日本运入硫黄，配备了几十万架喷雾器，指导几十万家棉农熟悉治虫技术，这个基础是全国各棉区所未有。但今天鱼藤根与硫黄来源困难，喷雾器的补充也不易迅速解决，现在除了利用存余的鱼藤根制鱼藤粉使用之外，可用烟草水，豆油乳剂与面糊浆水来解决（但在效力与推广上都有困难），并准备推广种黄花烟（小叶烟）来制硫酸尼古丁，与利用东北工矿条件来制造合成农药如ＤＤＴ与六六六等，这是一个复杂的技术问题。
    三、业务经营与管理
    棉花与普通的农产自有其特殊性质，棉产是纯粹的工业原料，又是市场上占有重要地位的商品，而且棉花的栽培又是比较精细而技术化的经营，因此棉业的经营必须是加强有关业务的计划性与组织广大的棉农互助合作，才能便利于发展。
    首先是棉价问题，如果种棉得不到比种别的农作物还有利的话，不管棉种产量质量多好，治虫方法与栽培技术多高明，农民总是不能多种棉花。东北棉农所流传的“一捆（十斤）花三斗（四十五斤）粮（高粱）”和“一亩棉（约二十六斤）二亩田（三百六十斤粮食）”就过去的资料与现在的调查情况来分析，结果也相近，五斤高粱换一斤籽棉（大花籽）是适合东北的一般情况，现在以一斤皮花换十四斤到十七斤高粱的作价，对于今年能迅速推广植棉起了很大作用。我们考察过去蒋管区的各棉区盛衰历史，棉花的比价关系很大，以布匹的价格来分析，统制掠夺多于商业利润，商业利润多于工业利润，而工业利润又多于农业收益，实际是工农赔本，严重的影响棉源不足，亟应提高农业利润，才能整个的发展生产。但是官僚资本相反地却以美棉做靠山，拼命加强统制掠夺，这就是棉价问题在过去蒋管区不可能解决，而成为棉业发展的基本障碍。只有今天新民主主义的经济，才能解决这个历来棉业的症结。
    在业务管理上，企业化的管理是有很大的作用。但现在我们一时还不能建立起来一个新的完整的棉业管理系统，暂时把这套完整的工作分割到各个有关的系统部门来分别负责进行，虽然也能解决许多重大的问题如棉价预购贷款，调剂棉籽等等，但是在许多具体工作上，还未能迅速完备的贯彻起来，如轧花厂的管理与修建，棉籽的选择与分配，分级的作价与检查，推广的合作组织，农药喷雾器的配备等等，都有些不合理不科学的浪费脱节表现，这将或多或少影响到东北棉业的发展，应及早健全组织，将数十万棉户组织起来，变成宏厚的合作经济力量，以加速东北棉产的发展，解决历来东北棉源不足的问题。
