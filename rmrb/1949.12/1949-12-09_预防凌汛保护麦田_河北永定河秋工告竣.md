　　Preventing Ice Flooding to Protect Wheat Fields
  　Hebei's Yongding River Autumn Works Completed
    [Our Newspaper] After the establishment of the Hebei Province Yongding River River Affairs Bureau in mid-September, it immediately studied the entire river's flood control project based on instructions from higher authorities and the characteristics of the river. It prepared to commence all construction in the coming spring, but in order to prevent risks during this winter's ice flood season and protect wheat fields, it was decided to implement a portion of the autumn works with a focus before the river froze. After detailed planning, construction began on November 12th. In the upstream Beijing urban area section alone, a total of 863 cubic meters of stone embankment was repaired, using 31,194 jin of white lime, 1,019 bags of cement, and employing 3,704 masons. In the Liangxiang County section, the two major dangerous works at Daning Village and Daotian Village, 29 sections of side weirs were repaired, with a total length of 110 zhang, 203 piles were driven, 520,000 jin of soft materials were used, and 2,817 skilled workers and 1,990 laborers were employed. In the downstream flooded areas of Wuqing, Anci, and Yongqing districts, protective embankments for wheat were built. According to statistics from Anci County alone, over 18,000 zhang were completed, with over 20,000 cubic meters of earthwork, using over 20,200 man-days. After 25 days, thanks to the efforts of cadres and workers, as well as the river guards along various sections, overcoming various difficulties in the cold weather, the autumn works were fully completed. In the future, defenses will be strengthened to prevent approximately one thousand hectares of wheat fields in the downstream areas from being flooded.
