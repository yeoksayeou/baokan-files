Key Points of the British Communist Party's Policy
　　Developing Trade with the Soviet Union and China
　　Expanding Nationalization

　　The report outlined four key points of the party's policy: (1) raising wages and expanding social services; (2) developing trade with the Soviet Union, People's Democratic countries, and New China; (3) ending the current criminal and wasteful military spending; and (4) nationalizing shipping, shipbuilding, steel, docks, mechanical engineering, the construction industry, and land.

　　The Communist Party defined its tasks as: thwarting imperialist war plans, ending Britain's dependence on the United States, and establishing inseparable ties and friendly relations with the socialist camp – the peace camp.

　　The report stated: "We are convinced that the British working class, loyal to the great international tradition of worker solidarity, will never participate in a war against the socialist Soviet Union, the new democratic countries, or New China. This Congress will solemnly guarantee to do everything possible to prevent such a war." The report also stated: The Party should organize its strength in such a way as to unite the vast forces that support peace. The report emphasized: A third world war is not inevitable, and the forces of peace far outweigh the forces of war; they can defeat the warmongers. In the struggle for peace, the working class has a great responsibility. It can prevent war. However, it should be understood that in order to prevent war, it is necessary to constantly fight against the policies of the Labor government.

　　When discussing the significance of the future British general election, the report emphasized that only the Communist Party's policies reflect the demands and interests of the broad masses.

　　Regarding the Party's attitude toward mistakes, the report stated: The Party has not yet fully learned from the mistakes it made after the war, which has indeed affected the Party's achievements. The report also pointed out that the main shortcoming in the Party's work is its failure to fully organize the masses to fight. The report emphasized the urgent need to transform the Party into a mass party, improve the theoretical level of Party members, and called on the entire Party to be vigilant to prevent the dangers caused by the destructive activities of saboteurs now organized by the Tito group to disintegrate the Party ranks.

　　Executive Committee member J. Horner presented a report to the congress on "The Struggle for the Liberation of Colonial Peoples." Executive Committee member J. Gardner gave a report to the congress on "The Political Education of Party Members," emphasizing the need to be vigilant.

　　Party Vice-Chairman R. P. Dutt presented the Party's election program, entitled "Britain's Road to Socialism," for discussion at the congress.

　　The Congress approved the report of the Executive Committee and unanimously approved the election program and certain other resolutions.

　　In a closed-door meeting, the delegates elected an Executive Committee composed of thirty-six members.

　　The Congress concluded with a closing speech by British Communist Party Chairman W. Gallacher. The Congress declared its closing in the singing of the Internationale.

　　英共政策要点
  　发展与苏中贸易
  　扩大实行国有化
    报告规划了党的政策的四个要点：（一）提高工资，扩大社会服务；（二）发展与苏联、人民民主国家和新中国的贸易；（三）终结目前这种犯罪的而且浪费的军事开支；（四）将航运、造船、钢、码头、机械工程、建筑工业和土地国有化。
    共产党规定自己的任务为：挫败帝国主义的战争计划，终止英国对美国的依赖，与社会主义阵营——和平阵营建立不可分的联系和友好关系。
    报告指称：“我们确信，忠于其工人阶级团结的伟大国际传统的英国工人阶级，决不参加反对社会主义苏联，新民主主义国家或新中国的战争。本届大会将庄严保证竭尽全力阻止这样的战争”。报告又称：党应该这样地组织它的力量，以便把拥护和平的广大力量团集起来。报告强调：第三次世界大战并不是不可避免的，和平的力量远超过战争的力量，它能够打败战争贩子的。在争取和平的斗争中，工人阶级负有巨大的责任。它能够阻止战争。但是，应该懂得，为了阻止战争，必须不断地与工党政府的政策斗争。
    报告在论及未来的英国大选的意义时，强调指出：只有共产党的政策，才反映了广大群众的要求和利益。
    报告在论及党对于错误所持的态度称：党还没有从自己在战后犯过的错误中吸取全部的经验教训，而这确实影响了党的成就。报告又指出，党的工作中的主要缺点，是未能充分地组织群众进行斗争。报告强调迫切需要把党变成为一个群众性的党，提高党员的理论水平，并号召全党提高警惕，以防止由于铁托集团现在所组织起来的破坏分子进行瓦解党的队伍的活动而引起的危险。
    执行委员会Ｊ·贺恩纳向大会提出一项关于“殖民地人民解放斗争”的报告。执行委员会委员Ｊ·加德纳向大会作了关于“党员的政治教育”的报告，强调需要提高警惕。
    党的副主席Ｒ·Ｐ·杜德提出党的竞选纲领，提交大会讨论，纲领的题目是“英国的社会主义道路”。
    大会批准了执行委员会的报告，并一致批准了竞选纲领及其他某些决议。
    在一次秘密书会议上，代表们选举了由三十六位委员组成的执行委员会。
    大会闭幕时由英共主席Ｗ·加拉赫致闭幕词。大会在国际歌声中宣告闭幕。
