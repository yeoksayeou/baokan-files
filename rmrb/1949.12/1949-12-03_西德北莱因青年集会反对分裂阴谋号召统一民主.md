　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 29th (TASS) — West German youth are increasingly and resolutely opposing the dividers of Germany and striving for a unified and democratic Germany. Erich Honecker, Chairman of the Free German Youth League, stated in a speech to the North Rhine-Westphalia (British Zone) branch of the League that the main task before the West German Free German Youth League is to strengthen the unity of the German working youth and prevent West Germany from being turned into a colony of Britain and the United States.

　　Other speakers at the meeting unanimously emphasized that the progress and development of the German Democratic Republic have a great influence on the work of the West German Free German Youth League. Cheers paying tribute to the German Democratic Republic and its Chairman Wilhelm Pieck repeatedly resounded in the meeting hall. The delegates warmly welcomed the invitation of West German youth to participate in the All-German Youth Congress to be held in Berlin in the summer of 1950. The meeting decided to send 10,000 young men and women from North Rhine-Westphalia to participate in the congress.

　　In other news, the Committee for German Unity in the American-occupied zone of Hesse recently passed a resolution demanding that "all parts of Germany be granted the same rights as those enjoyed by the German Democratic Republic." The resolution calls for the conclusion of a peace treaty and the withdrawal of all occupation forces, and protests the handover of the Ruhr area to foreign capital.
