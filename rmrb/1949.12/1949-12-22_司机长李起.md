　　Driver Li Qi
　　By Bì Yě

　　Li Qi, the driver of Locomotive No. 1751 at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, is a probationary party member. With thick eyebrows, a dark red, square face, leggings tightly bound around his calves, and the long fur of his old sheepskin coat fluttering in the wind, he appears extremely valiant.

　　When workers at the depot mention Li Qi, everyone knows he was a "soft mushroom" (lazy and unproductive). With thirteen years of experience, he never worked properly for a single day before liberation, indulging in eating, drinking, and "stealing." He was even arrested and tortured during the enemy puppet regime for "stealing" things. "Working to death for those bastards only gets you a trouser belt in the end? I'll be lazy when I can be, steal when I can steal. No one will get a penny's worth of advantage from me as long as I live!" This was Li Qi's philosophy of life in the past.

　　But after Fengtai was liberated on December 14, 1948, Li Qi was transformed as if he had been reborn. Only when the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army came did he realize that there was a world for the workers, that the working class created the world. It was as if he was a piece of scrap iron before, and the Communist Party was a smelting furnace, melting him down and forging him into a good piece of steel.

　　In July, he became a probationary party member. The Communist Party thought highly of him, and he was overjoyed. But the organization gave him a task: to be responsible for improving Locomotive No. 1751 to match the model locomotive No. 1939. This worried him again.

　　How could Locomotive No. 1751 compare to Locomotive No. 1939! No. 1939 had three drivers and six stokers, nine people with one heart; No. 1751 had nine people with nine different hearts! But the task given by the higher-ups had to be completed. Fortunately, Li Qi was an old friend of Li Yonglu, the driver of Locomotive No. 1939, and had worked on the same locomotive. He studied with Li Yonglu in his spare time and researched diligently himself. As a result, he found a way: first unite, then achieve results. First, unite the internal team, solve difficulties for everyone, encourage them more, and criticize and find fault less.

　　So Li Qi invited the drivers and stokers of Locomotive No. 1751 to a self-criticism meeting. At first, no one wanted to speak at the meeting. Li Qi knew that everyone had their own thoughts, showing their faces but not their hearts. In order to get everyone to open up, Li Qi first frankly criticized himself, saying that he had not taken the lead well and had not taken good care of everyone. As a result, everyone's brows relaxed, and they began to talk and laugh, criticizing themselves. Stoker Qiao Chengxiang said, "We only joked around when we worked, unwilling to work hard. If someone offended us, we would get angry and simply stop working. That's how we dawdled! We have to change in the future and learn from Li Qi!" Stoker Liu Zhaoyuan said, "I am too confident, considering only my own words as important, and dismissing everyone else's, showing attitude, causing disunity. I liked to be lazy when working, leaving early and arriving late, only thinking of myself, not of the public. I must overthrow this 'reactionary' in my heart and work hard with Comrade Lao Li!" They all confessed their faults, making Li Qi laugh. He encouraged everyone, saying, "As long as nine people are of one mind, yellow earth will turn into gold. We will work hard together and guarantee to catch up with Locomotive No. 1939!"

　　The stoker Xiao Yonglu, who lived in the same courtyard as Qiao Chengxiang (Xiao Yonglu was also surnamed Li, because he had the same name as the driver of Locomotive No. 1939, so everyone called him Xiao Yonglu), was always worried, his face like a bitter melon. Li Qi asked him, but he always refused to say, his face tight. Later, after Li Qi investigated, he learned that Xiao Yonglu's hometown in Tangshan had been flooded, and a family of ten had come to rely on him, without shelter or food. Li Qi wanted to help him, but he didn't have the means. He not only had his own family to support, but he also had to subsidize a worker's family with fifty kilograms of cornmeal every month. So he ran around for Xiao Yonglu's affairs in the wind and snow, wearing out his only pair of rubber shoes, his soles soaked with snow water. Later, with the help of the union, Xiao Yonglu's brother was introduced to work in a cement factory, solving Xiao Yonglu's difficulties.

　　In this way, the knot in Xiao Yonglu's heart was untied by Li Qi.

　　"Driver, I will work hard for you to see!" Xiao Yonglu was so grateful that he was about to cry.

　　The other drivers and stokers were also touched and grew closer to Li Qi.

　　Driver Li Qi smiled, no longer worried, so his second step was to diligently study how to exert everyone's strength and how to catch up with Locomotive No. 1939. Li Qi thought of first achieving a result to boost everyone's confidence.

　　Coincidentally, on December 10th, Locomotive No. 1751 received a task from the higher-ups—to pull thirty-eight freight cars to Tianjin.

　　This train of freight cars converted to 16.9 (one conversion is 43.5 tons, meaning the train weight was 7351.5 tons), calculated as 40 (one calculation is 11 meters, meaning the train length was 440 meters).

　　After accepting this task, Li Qi carefully inspected the oil furnace, water boiler, and other parts as if managing a household. At the same time, he motivated stokers Liu Zhaoyuan and Qiao Chengxiang:

　　"The Communist Party is leading everyone to create models in order to increase production. Let's work hard today and see if we can create a new record. Just do it boldly!"

　　Upon hearing about creating a model, Liu Zhaoyuan grinned widely, and Qiao Chengxiang became even more energetic.

　　Li Qi seized the opportunity to contact the dispatchers at each station along the way, requesting them to take care of Locomotive No. 1751's passage, clearing the route for him in advance. He guaranteed to arrive at each station on time.

　　At 14:40, Locomotive No. 1751, pulling a long train of freight cars, left Fengtai Station with billowing smoke. Qiao Chengxiang's work enthusiasm was particularly high today, shoveling coal evenly and accurately into the furnace, sweat dripping down his face. The train moved forward quickly, the wind howling, and plumes of smoke trailed behind the train. Li Qi looked at the road ahead, then at the water gauge. When going uphill, he immediately activated the sander; when on flat ground, he fully applied the brakes, busily doing this and that.

　　Every train had to stop for twenty minutes at Langfang Station to add water, but Li Qi tried his best not to let the locomotive spray water along the way. The water gauge told him he was confident he could run to Tianjin Station without adding water. Li Qi had notified the dispatcher at Langfang Station of the locomotive's condition in advance, so the water replenishment could be omitted. As a result, the train quickly passed through the Langfang water station without stopping for even a second.

　　Sure enough, Locomotive No. 1751 broke the previous record. It left Fengtai at 14:40 and arrived in Tianjin at only 16:39. Normally, the train journey took about three hours, but Li Qi and his team created an amazing record in just one hour and fifty-nine minutes!

　　The Tianjin District Dispatch Office issued a commendation for Locomotive No. 1751 for improving technical speed and increasing vehicle turnover rate.

　　"In the past, people would wrinkle their noses and walk away when they saw us workers, but now we workers are in charge and creating the world!" Qiao Chengxiang happily waved his peaked cap.

　　"Look at our No. 1751, we must catch up with No. 1939!" Liu Zhaoyuan patted his chest and said.

　　"I was right, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are leading us, and we workers have turned over..." Li Qi said solemnly.

　　司机长李起
    碧野
    丰台机务段一七五一号机车司机长李起，是一个候补党员。粗眉毛，黑红黑红的方脸，裹腿紧紧绑在腿肚子上，老羊皮袄领子上的长毛给风吹得一飘一飘的，显得十分英武。
    段上的工友一提起李起，谁都知道他是个“软蘑”，他的工龄十三年，浑身本领，在解放前就没好好干过一天活，吃、喝、“偷”，在敌伪时期他就为了“偷”东西给抓去受过苦刑。“给王八旦干死干活，还不是只落根裤带？能蘑就蘑，能偷就偷，我活在世上一天谁也别想沾我一分便宜！”这就是以往李起的人生哲学。
    可是一九四八年十二月十四日丰台解放后，李起就象换了骨转了胎，全变成另外一个人了。共产党、人民解放军来了，他才知道有个工人的世界，才知道工人阶级创造世界的真理。这好比他从前是块废铁，共产党是座化铁炉，把他熔化了，把他炼成了一块好钢铁。
    七月间他成了候补党员，共产党瞧得起他，他齐心眼都乐开了，可是组织上给了他一个任务，要他负责把一七五一号机车搞好，跟模范机车一九三九号看齐，这可又把他愁住了。
    一七五一号机车那能跟一九三九号机车比呀！人家一九三九号三个司机，六个司炉，九人一条心；一七五一号可就九人九条心呵！可是上级给的任务是一定要完成的。幸好李起跟一九三九号机车的司机长李永禄是老朋友，曾在同一台机车上干过活，他一边凑空儿跟李永禄学习，一边自己苦心钻研，结果他找出了一个办法：先团结好，然后搞成绩。最先把内部团结好，多替大伙解决困难，多帮助鼓励，少批评挑刺。
    于是李起邀齐一七五一号机车的司机和司炉开了个检讨会，起先谁也不愿在检讨会上发言。李起知道各人有各人的心思，只露脸，不露心。李起为了要把大伙心里的话逗出来，就先很坦白地检讨了自己，说自己没有好好带头干，没有好好照顾大伙。这一来，大伙的眉头平展了，有说有笑的就自圪扯起来。司炉乔成祥说：“咱做活时只顾开玩笑，不肯干，谁冲了咱，咱就发脾气，干脆放下活不干啦。这就是咱泡的办法！以后咱得改，好好跟李起学！”司炉刘兆元说：“我自信心太强，自己说话算话，大伙说话就不算话，耍态度，闹得大伙不团结。干起活来我爱偷懒，早走晚来，只有私心，没有公心。我得打倒我这心里的‘反动派’，跟老李同志一块好好干！”这样你一言，我一语的就全坦白啦，把李起逗乐啦，他鼓励大伙说：“只要九人一条心，黄土就变成金，我们大伙好好干，保证能撵上一九三九号机车！”
    跟乔成祥同院住的司炉小永禄（小永禄也姓李，因为跟一九三九号机车司机长同名同姓，所以大伙叫他做小永禄），整天愁得脸象苦瓜。李起问他，他绷着脸总是不肯说，后来经过李起调查研究了一番，才知道了小永禄唐山老家给水淹了，一家大小十口就奔来依靠他，没住没吃的。李起心想帮助他，可是力不从心，自己不单有家口，并且每月还要补助一个工属五十斤老玉米。于是他在大风大雪里，为小永禄的事东奔西跑，把唯一的一双胶鞋都跑破了，脚底板渗满了雪水，后来经工会的帮助，才算把小永禄的兄弟介绍进了洋灰厂做工，解决了小永禄的困难问题。
    这么一来，小永禄心里的苦疙瘩就给李起解了。
    “司机长，我要好好干给你瞧！”小永禄感激得直要掉眼泪。
    另外的司机和司炉，都感动得跟李起扣上了心眼。
    司机长李起笑展了眉，不再发愁了，于是他第二步就又苦心钻研怎样发挥大伙的力量，怎样去跟一九三九号机车看齐。李起心想先搞个成绩，提高大伙的信心。
    恰好十二月十号这一天，一七五一号机车接受了上级给予的一个乘务——把三十八节货车拉到天津去。
    这列货车换算十六．九（一换算为四十三吨半，即列车重量为七千三百五十一吨半），计算四十（一计算为十一米，即列车长度为四百四十米）。
    李起接受这一乘务后，象过小日子似的，立即把油炉、水锅等处小心地检查了个遍。同时他给司炉刘兆元和乔成祥做鼓动工作：
    “共产党领导大伙搞典型（创造模范），是为了提高生产，我们今天好好干，瞧瞧能不能创造个新纪录。你们只管大胆干！”
    一听说要赶搞典型，刘兆元就乐得张大了嘴巴，乔成祥更是多来劲。
    李起抓紧机会给沿途各站的调度员联络好，请求照顾他的一七五一号走行，事先给他辟开路线，他保证能准时到站。
    十四点四十分，一七五一号机车牵引着长长的一列货车，浓烟滚滚地出了丰台站，乔成祥今天工作情绪格外高涨，一铲铲的煤又均匀又准确的往炉里扬进去，干得汗珠儿满脸直淌。列车迅速地往前走行，风呜呜地直叫，一团一团的烟长长地曳在列车后面。李起一时望望前边奔来的路面，一时望望水表，一到上坡，立即开动扬砂器，一到平路，就开足了制动器，紧张忙碌地干这又干那。
    每列车到廊坊站，总要停二十分钟来加水，可是李起一路上极力不让机头喷水，水表告诉他有把握不加水，就可以一口气跑到天津站。李起事先把机车的状态通知了廊坊站的调度员，可以省略补水，于是列车很快就从廊坊的给水站冲了过去，连一秒钟也有停。
    果然一七五一号机车突破了历来的纪录，十四点四十分由丰台开车，到达天津只十六点三十九分，平常列车走行时间要三个钟头左右，李起他们这次只以一点五十九分创造了惊人的纪录！
    天津区调度所特别为一七五一号机车提高技术速度，增加车辆周转率发布了表扬令。
    “从前人家瞧见我们工人拧着鼻子就走，现在我们工人当了家创了世界啦！”乔成祥乐得直挥鸭舌帽。
    “瞧瞧我们的一七五一号，非跟一九三九号看齐不可！”刘兆元拍着胸脯说。
    “我说的没错吧，共产党、毛主席领导我们，我们工人就翻了个过，……”李起很庄严的说。
