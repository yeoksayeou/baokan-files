　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government and the Changsha Special District of Hunan Province have decided to conduct activities to comfort the troops during the New Year. The Civil Affairs Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government recently issued a notice, pointing out that the work of comforting the troops this year should focus on comfort and get-togethers, such as hanging honorary plaques and sending honorary lanterns, to enhance the political status of the families of martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary workers. In carrying out comfort, preferential treatment, and relief work, we should mobilize and organize the families of soldiers and workers to actively participate in production. For individual cases of special hardship, the government should provide each of their direct relatives with a preferential grain ration of one to one and a half *dou*. The Changsha Special District of Hunan Province recently established a committee to comfort the troops, and decided to carry out a "Support the Army Week" throughout the special district from December 30th of this year to January 5th of next year, and to widely educate the masses to support and comfort the People's Liberation Army. In the movement to comfort the troops, the main measures taken will be writing letters of condolence and holding get-togethers with the army, in order to avoid increasing the burden on the people.
