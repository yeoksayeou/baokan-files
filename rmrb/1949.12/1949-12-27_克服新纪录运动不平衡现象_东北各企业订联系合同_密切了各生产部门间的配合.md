Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 26th. To overcome the imbalances between various production departments in the new record creation movement, state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China are universally signing liaison contracts between their production departments. Many factory leaders are personally going deep into the workshops to understand the key areas where production departments are disconnected, widely absorbing the opinions of workers, technicians, and staff to develop improvement methods and specifically organize interconnected workshops and teams to sign liaison contracts. The casting iron team of the Fifth Machinery Factory of the Mechanical Engineering Bureau under the Ministry of Industry, due to poor coordination between the team's work processes, led to the October cast iron production failing to meet the needs of the machine processing field, causing related departments to experience downtime waiting for materials, resulting in 20 percent of the factory's machines not being fully utilized. After the factory leaders convened the entire team for research and discussion, they signed a liaison contract. In November, the team's productivity increased more than twofold compared to October, and the rejection rate decreased from 1.95 percent to 0.65 percent, eliminating the downtime waiting for materials in related departments caused by the team's low productivity. Under the active leadership and organization of the trade union, the Shenyang Woolen Mill proposed general conditions for guaranteeing quality to each other in November among more than 40 workshops in the factory and signed liaison contracts, correcting some deviations in the new record creation movement. For example, in the past, the blending group of the wool-making department, in order to create new records for saving blending oil, would add water and reduce oil without limit, resulting in reduced wool top quality and increased difficulty in spinning wool. After signing a liaison contract with the spinning department, the oil-water ratio was accurately blended, and the quality of the wool top was improved, with the proportion of defective products reduced from 9.2 percent of all wool tops to 5.5 percent. In addition to specific regulations on output, quality, consumption standards, and time, the liaison contracts between the work processes of the Andong No. 1 Paper Mill also stipulate how to reward those who exceed the task and how to punish those who hinder the normal production of another department due to subjective reasons on one side. Other units, such as Shenyang Automobile General Factory, Fushun Victory Coal Mine, the Third Machinery Factory, and the No. 2 Rubber Factory, have also successively signed liaison contracts, which have played a significant role in transforming individual new records into collective new records and improving the overall factory and mine production efficiency.
	The establishment of liaison contracts must be combined with certain production standards.
	During the deliberation and discussion of the establishment of liaison contracts in various factories and mines, in addition to individual workers fearing being bound by the contract and emphasizing objective difficulties, some grassroots cadres and workers also have the opposite deviation: believing that the establishment of liaison contracts is to set "challenge letters," without considering or giving little consideration to the conditions or strength of their own units, rashly making "determined guarantees," thus easily causing the contract to fail. Some departments also place excessive demands on other departments, causing a stalemate in the signing of liaison contracts. The above-mentioned deviations have been promptly noticed and corrected by the leading organs of the industrial and mining enterprises. The experience of various factories has proved that whether the liaison contract is established in a practical manner must be combined with certain production standards. The liaison contract between the paper-making and adjustment departments of the Andong No. 1 Paper Mill clearly stipulates that the paper machine should produce 8.5 tons of paper per day, and the adjustment machine should provide 9.25 tons of raw materials, making the goals of both parties clear and increasing work confidence. Conversely, the liaison contracts of some workshops in the Shenyang Woolen Mill only put forward general guarantee conditions without making specific regulations on output, quality, consumption standards, etc., so that the workers did not have clear goals to strive for, affecting the further development of their production enthusiasm. At present, because various factories and mines still lack experience in signing liaison contracts, the contract period is set to one month, waiting to gradually accumulate experience to make this work more perfect.

　　克服新纪录运动不平衡现象
　  东北各企业订联系合同
    密切了各生产部门间的配合
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】东北各国营工矿企业为克服创造生产新纪录运动中各生产部门的不平衡现象，正在各生产部门之间普遍签订联系合同。不少工厂的领导干部都亲自深入车间，了解各部门之间生产发生脱节现象的关键所在，广泛吸收工人、技术人员和职员的意见，得出改进办法，具体组织相互联系的车间、小组，签订联系合同。工业部所属机械管理局第五机械厂的铸铁班，因该班各工序之间联系不好，致十月份的铸铁生产，供给不上机器加场的需要，使与该班生产相互关联的部门发生停工待料现象，因而全厂有百分之二十的机器未能充分使用。经该厂领导人召集全班工人进行研究讨论后，即签订了联系合同，十一月份中该班生产力较十月份即提高了两倍以上，废品则由百分之一点九五，减少到百分之零点六五，消灭了因该班生产力低而引起的有关部门的停工待料现象。沈阳毛织厂在工会积极领导和组织下，十一月份全厂四十多个车间互相提出保证质量的一般条件，相互签订联系合同，纠正了在创造新纪录运动中的某些偏向。如该厂制毛部调和组过去为了创造节省调和油的新纪录，便无限制地多掺水少加油，结果使毛条质量降低，增加纺毛困难。与纺毛部签订联系合同后，油水比例调和准确，毛条质量即有改进，不良品由占全部毛条的百分之九点二减为百分之五点五。安东第一造纸厂各工序间的联系合同上，除对产量、质量、消耗标准和时间都有具体规定外，对超过任务如何奖励和因一方主观原因而妨碍另一部门进行正常生产如何处罚，亦有所规定。其他如沈阳汽车总厂、抚顺胜利煤矿、第三机械工厂、橡胶二厂等单位，亦先后签订了联系合同，对于由个人新纪录转为集体新纪录和提高全厂矿生产效率上，都起了很大推动作用。
    订立联系合同，必须与一定的生产标准相结合。
    各厂矿在酝酿和讨论订立联系合同时，除个别工人怕受合同约束、强调客观困难外，部分基层干部和工人亦发生相反偏向：认为订联系合同就是定“挑战书”，不考虑或少考虑本单位的条件或力量，轻率的“决心保证”，因而易使合同落空；另有一些部门则对别的部门提出过高要求，使双方在签订联系合同时造成僵局。上述偏向均经工矿领导机关的及时注意纠正。各厂经验证明：联系合同订立的切实与否，必须与一定的生产标准相结合。安东第一造纸厂抄纸与调成部门的联系合同上，明确规定抄纸机每日抄造纸八吨半，调成机供给原料九点二五吨，使双方努力目标明确，增加了工作信心。相反的，如沈阳毛织厂某些车间的联系合同，仅提出一般保证条件，没有对产量、质量、消耗量标准等方面作出具体规定，使工人们没有明确的奋斗目标，影响了他们生产积极性的进一步发挥。目前因为各厂矿对于签订联系合同的工作还缺乏经验，所以合同期限都定为一个月，以待逐步积累经验，使这一工作更趋完善。
