　　Lu Zhongnan District

　　Prices Fall
　　Urban-Rural Trade Returns to Normal
　　[Our Newspaper] Commodity prices in the Lu Zhongnan District, which had once fluctuated, have comprehensively fallen since the beginning of this month under the effective measures taken by state-owned trading departments and cooperatives. The decline started in the cities, and by the 4th, commodity prices throughout the district were basically stable. Initially, because urban prices fell first, merchants flocked to rural areas to sell goods at high prices, creating an abnormal difference between urban and rural prices, which affected the normal development of urban-rural material exchange. State-owned trading departments immediately coordinated with cooperatives to sell goods, and sent people to sell goods at listed prices in various markets where there were no state-owned stores. Currently, the situation has largely reached the point where industrial products are cheaper in cities than in rural areas, and agricultural products are cheaper in rural areas than in cities. Urban-rural trade has returned to normal.

　　鲁中南区
  　物价回落
  　城乡贸易已趋正常
    【本报讯】一度波动的鲁中南区物价，在国营贸易部门及合作社采取有效措施下，本月初即告全面下落，以城市为前导，至四日全区物价基本上趋于平稳。初期因城市物价先落，商人纷纷携货至乡村高价出售，使城乡价格差额形成不正常状态，影响城乡物资交流的正常发展。国营贸易部门当即通过合作社，配合抛售货物，并派人携货至无公营商店之各集市按牌价出售。目前大致上已达到工业品，城市低于乡村；农产品，乡村低于城市的情况。城乡贸易已趋正常。
