　　The Secret to the Wage System Has Been Discovered
  　An Introduction to the Production Management Experience of Dalian State-Owned Enterprises (Part Two)
    Tian Lin
    The Dalian state-owned enterprises implement a seven-grade wage system with fewer grades and larger grade differences (the salaries of staff members are fifteen grades). Based on this, they have implemented progressive piece-rate wage systems and piecework wage systems in a step-by-step manner. This wage system was initially promoted in Sino-Soviet joint ventures. The coefficients of the seven-grade wage system from grade one to grade seven (with the lowest grade as one) are: 1, 1.20, 1.45, 1.75, 2.15, 2.60, 3.20. Regardless of the different wage standards between heavy industry and light industry, the coefficients are the same. This coefficient shows that the seven-grade system not only has large grade differences, but also that the grade differences are progressive. Simply put, whoever has better skills and a higher grade earns more money. Moreover, the progression rate from grade one to grade four and from grade five to grade six is not large, but the progression rate from grade four to grade five and from grade six to grade seven is very large. It seems strange, but the reason is simple. Precisely because the progression rate is different, it encourages ordinary workers below grade four to work hard to learn skills and become skilled workers, and encourages five and six-grade skilled workers or experienced workers to work harder to master technology and become the best seven-grade workers. Therefore, Soviet comrades said that the seven-grade wage system contains a major political significance for cultivating cadres and training talents. The facts are indeed so. In factories implementing this system, workers are constantly upgraded through a strict skill assessment system. In this way, workers' wages gradually increase with the continuous improvement of their skills. For example, although the cement factory only implemented the seven-grade wage system last year, the average wage of each worker has increased by 25% compared to the previous year.
    The seven-grade progressive wage system itself has the effect of encouraging workers to improve their skills. When a progressive piece-rate wage system, piecework system, and progressive piecework system are implemented on its basis, the encouragement effect is even greater. For example, the glass factory stipulates that the standard number of square meters for cutting glass in eight hours is 280 square meters. If the worker produces more than this number, cuts well, and saves diamonds, they will receive a progressive wage increase based on their basic salary, that is, the wage the worker receives according to the seven-grade wage system. If a basic worker exceeds the standard output by 5%, they will receive a 10% wage increase, up to a 75% increase, with a 100% wage increase. If the worker does not reach the standard output due to non-absenteeism or other subjective reasons, they can still receive their basic salary. However, if there is too much waste, wages will be deducted. This system is relatively simple and easy to implement, which not only guarantees the livelihood of workers, but also encourages workers to study technology and improve production. The large number of rationalization proposals put forward when the glass factory and paint factory implemented this system last year is the best illustration of workers' efforts to improve technology. Because the output of the glass factory last year increased by 136% compared to the previous year, the total wage also increased by 24%. This wage system is also a bridge from the general time-based system to the piecework system. It is precisely because the glass factory and paint factory implemented this wage system, gradually improved the factory management organization and management system, and gradually found a more appropriate output quota, that they began or partially began to implement the piecework system this year.
    The piecework system can better stimulate production. Therefore, it can best improve the lives of workers. Taking the Dalian Zhongchang Railway Factory as an example, although the factory had more or less egalitarian shortcomings in the implementation of the piecework system, by the spring of this year, workers' wages had increased by an average of 37% compared to the previous year (this number includes the wages of new workers; if new workers are not counted, the increase rate would be much larger); by September, the highest wage had increased by 253% compared to April of the previous year before the piecework system was implemented (the above are all calculated in currency; if calculated in corn, the increase rate would be much larger, because since the Dalian currency reform in November last year, Dalian prices have fallen significantly). As workers' incomes increased, the factory not only did not lose money, but accumulated more funds. Because the value created by each worker in the past year has increased by 130% compared to the previous year, and if calculated at the level of this spring, it has increased by 200% compared to the previous year. The factory's capital accumulation rate is much larger than the increase rate of workers' wages, which is one of the basic guarantees for the rapid development of production and the gradual improvement of workers' lives. In the most difficult times in the previous year, workers with heavier family burdens often needed to sell junk and eat soybean cakes to support their families, but since last year, due to the gradual increase in wages, coupled with the gradual decline in prices since the Dalian currency reform in November last year, workers above grade five can eat rice for an average of ten and a half months a month, and some workers have even bought radios. Among the 530 workers in the steel structure workshop of the railway factory, 73 people deposit money in the bank every month. Not only has the life of employed workers been improved, but due to the development of production, a large number of unemployed workers have also found jobs. The number of workers in the railway factory alone (including apprentices) has more than doubled this year compared to the previous year.
    How is the piecework wage system calculated? According to the nature of the work, such as the paint factory's canning, it can be divided into stages such as cutting iron plates, rolling the body, flanging, and forming. Here, a unit price (the cost of labor per unit of product) is set for each stage. However, if the stages are closely linked and inseparable, a unit price is set for the entire process. As for the people, if cutting glass is done by one person, it is calculated on an individual piecework basis. If riveting requires the coordinated action of four people, including aligning, holding the rivet, and firing the fire, it is calculated on a collective piecework basis (individual piecework should be done as much as possible for those who can do individual piecework). In addition, such as repairing broken electric rollers, the degree of damage is different, and they need to be repaired quickly, so it is stipulated how much money will be given for repairing one within a certain period of time. When implementing the piecework wage system, a 10% increase on the seven-grade wage is generally used as the basic salary. The unit price is determined based on the basic salary and the output quota. For example, for cutting glass, based on the daily quota (the quota is generally unchanged throughout the year) of 280 square meters, it takes 1.7 minutes per square meter, then if a seven-grade worker cuts, the unit price per square meter is the basic salary of a seven-grade worker for 1.7 minutes, and if a six-grade worker cuts, it is the basic salary of a six-grade worker for 1.7 minutes. For example, for riveting, if four workers of different grades need one hour to rivet one hundred seven-fen nails, then the unit price for riveting these one hundred nails is the sum of the hourly basic salaries of these four workers. When distributing wages, it is calculated according to the basic salary coefficient of each person. In this way, workers with higher grades earn more money for doing more work. Therefore, in factories implementing the piecework system, workers work especially hard to learn technology and strive to research and put forward rationalization proposals to improve machines and tools.
    The progressive piecework system stipulates how many pieces are made within a certain period of time. Within the stipulated number, wages are calculated according to the piecework system, and wages are calculated according to a certain progressive rate for the number exceeding the stipulated number within the stipulated time. This is better than a simple piecework system in that it can give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of workers.
    The more developed the production, the more the correctness of the seven-grade system, the progressive piece-rate wage system, and the piecework wage system is seen. In the beginning, state-owned factories outside of Sino-Soviet joint ventures did not adopt this wage system, but another egalitarian wage system. According to the latter wage system, workers' wages were set relatively high from the beginning when production had not yet developed, and there were many grades, with some factories having as many as thirty or forty grades, and the difference between grades was very small. This wage system, in the most difficult period when production was stalled in 1947, was well-received by the general workers because it took care of the lives of the vast majority of workers and provided relief to unemployed workers, and thus improved the class consciousness of the workers to a considerable extent. However, because social relief and wages were not distinguished in nature, workers received the same wages and rations regardless of whether the factory was open or closed; and because the wage system itself had egalitarian flaws, it could not stimulate production and technological development, and a sentence was popular among the workers: "Technology or no technology, the money earned is about the same." Therefore, although some factories also developed production, the speed of development was far behind that of Sino-Soviet joint ventures. For example, the value created by workers in the Sino-Soviet joint venture railway factory increased by 130% last year compared to the previous year (calculated per worker), while in the state-owned Dalian Textile Factory, it only increased by 64% during the same period (calculated by total number). Precisely because of this, the wages of Sino-Soviet joint venture factories gradually increased, while the wages of other state-owned factories relatively decreased. The former, such as the railway factory, saw the highest wage rise to 175 jin of corn last October (excluding rations), while the latter, such as the Guanghe Machinery Factory, still only had a highest wage of 136 jin (excluding rations) during the same period. As a result, raising the standard again would be inconsistent with the overall industrial development and would also be feared to affect costs. Not raising it would make the workers dissatisfied. Later, after studying the wage system of Sino-Soviet joint ventures, it was recognized that it was determined according to the principle of "distribution according to labor." There is no doubt that "distribution according to labor" should become the wage principle of the new democratic society, because only in this way can the improvement of productivity be encouraged, production developed, and thus the lives of workers improved. By discovering this secret, the Lüda state-owned enterprises have since obtained a powerful factor to stimulate the development of production.
    In April of this year, the Lüda Administrative Office's Industry Bureau issued a circular to all subordinate factories to imitate the new wage system of distribution according to labor in Sino-Soviet joint ventures. The workers generally responded: "Now, the Eight Immortals cross the sea, each can show their special abilities!" After the responsible persons of each factory issued the circular, after explaining it to cadres and workers, they immediately carried out a wage evaluation movement based on the seven-grade system, re-determined the workers' grades, and initially determined the production quotas and product specifications. On this basis, the progressive piece-rate wage system was implemented, and the piecework system and progressive piecework system were gradually carried out. In the factories that changed to the new wage system, all workers worked harder and were active, so in the first month, there were significant changes in output and quality. For example, after the Guangyuan Oil and Fat Factory implemented the progressive piecework system, the oil yield of the soybean field in June increased by 98%. The Guanghe Machinery Factory began to change to the piecework system in July. Workers were afraid that the products would not meet the specifications, so they carefully improved their technology. As a result, the waste of lathe parts in July decreased from 190 pieces in June to only 5 pieces. The Jinzhou Textile Factory saved two million Guandong yuan in wrapping materials alone in September.
    As of now, almost all state-owned factories outside of Sino-Soviet joint ventures in Dalian have been changed to the seven-grade wage system, and the piecework system and progressive piecework system have been implemented among 78% of the workers. After re-grading in each factory, the excessively high wages of many ordinary workers have decreased, but the wages of many skilled workers have increased. However, not only have skilled workers been encouraged, but the emotions of ordinary workers have not been lowered as a result. They know in their hearts that after the implementation of the progressive piece-rate wage system and the piecework system, the basic wage cannot limit them from obtaining higher compensation by improving their skills. Sure enough, due to everyone's research on technology, the average wage has begun to rise. For example, the Guangyuan Oil and Fat Factory spent more than 330,000 yuan more on wages in June than in April. And the factory? Not only did it not lose money, but it increased its income by more than 3.6 million yuan due to reasons such as the reduction in labor costs per unit product. The textile factory has eliminated the waste of cotton.
    However, many factories still have many shortcomings and difficulties in implementing the correct wage system, which need to be further studied and improved. For example, it is necessary to continue to overcome the view of individual cadres that simply accommodates the interests of workers, to reasonably determine uniform worker grade standards, to stipulate correct production quotas and product specifications, to establish a strict inspection system and inspection organization, to improve the accounting system, etc. Only in this way can the wage system be more reasonable and more able to encourage workers to actively improve technology, increase the quantity and quality of products, and reduce costs, so that Dalian's industry can develop further.

　　工资制度的决窃摸到了
  　大连公营企业生产管理经验介绍之二
    田林
    大连公营企业所实行的是等级少、级差大的七级工资制度（职员的薪资是十五级），并以此为基础，有步聚地实行了超额累进奖薪工资制度和计件工资制度。这种工资制度起初是在中苏合营企业中推行的。七级工资制从一级到七级的系数（以最低一级为一）是：一、一．二○、一．四五、一．七五、二．一五、二．六○、三．二○。不管重工业和轻工业的工资标准有高低不同，但系数都是一样的。这个系数说明七级制不仅级差大，而且级差是累进的。简单的说，就是谁的技术好、等级高，谁就挣更多的工钱。不仅如此，从一级到四级和从五级到六级的累进率不大，但是从四级到五级和从六级到七级的累进率却很大。看起来好象很奇怪、其实道理很简单。正因为累进率不同，就鼓舞着四级以下的普通工人努力学技术变成技术工人、五、六级技术工人或熟练工人更努力精通技术，成为技术最好的七级工人。所以苏联同志说七级工资制包含有培养干部造就人才的重大政治意义。事实的确如此。在实行这种制度的工厂中，经过严格的考工制度，工人不断地升级。这样，工人的工资就随着技术的不断提高而逐步增加。如洋灰工厂在去年虽然只实行了七级工资制，平均每个工人的工资就已经比前年增加了百分之二十五。
    七级累进工资制本身具有鼓励工人提高技术的作用，当在它的基础之上实行超额累进奖薪制、计件制、计件累进制时，鼓励作用就更大。如玻璃工厂规定八小时裁玻璃的标准数为二百八十平方米，如工人生产超过此数，裁得也好，又节省了金刚石，就按本俸即工人按七级工资制所得的工资累进加薪。基本工人超过标准产量百分之五即加薪百分之十，直到超过百分之七十五，奖薪百分之百为止。如果不是由于欠勤或其他主观原因，工人达不到标准产量，仍然可领本俸。但如废货过多，则须扣工资。这种制度比较简单易行，不但能保障工人生活，而且还能鼓励工人钻研技术，提高生产。去年玻璃工厂和油漆工厂等实行这种制度时，合理化建议大量提出，就是工人努力改进技术的最好说明。因为去年玻璃工厂的产量比前年提高了百分之一百三十六，所以工资总额也随着增加了百分之二十四。这种工资制度又是从一般计时制过渡到计件制的桥梁。玻璃工厂和油漆工厂就是因为实行了这种工资制度，逐渐健全了工厂管理机构和管理制度，逐渐摸到了比较恰当的产量定额，今年就开始或部分地开始实行了计件制。
    计件制更能刺激生产。因此，也就最能使工人生活得到改善。以大连中长路铁路工厂为例，尽管该厂在实行计件制中也曾或多或少地有着平均主义的缺点，但是到今年春季，工人工资就比前年平均增加了百分之三十七（此数包括新工人工资在内，如新工人不算，增加率要大得多）；到九月份，最高工资比前年四月实行计件制前则增加了百分之二百五十三（以上均按货币计算，如按玉米计算，则增加率要大得多，因自去年十一月大连货币改革以后，大连物价大大下降）。工人收入增加了，而工厂却不仅没有赔钱，反而积累了更多的资金。因为平均每一工人在去年内创造的价值，已比前年增加了百分之一百三十，如以今年春季的水平计算，就比前年增加了百分之二百。工厂资金积累率比工人工资上升率大得多，这是生产迅速发展，工人生活逐步改善的基本保证之一。在前年最困难的时候，家庭负担较大的工人常常需要卖破烂东西，吃豆饼来维持家属生活，但自去年以来到现在，由于工资逐渐增加，加上去年十一月大连实行币制改革以来物价逐步下降，五级以上工人平均一个月可以吃上十天半月的大米，有些工人还买了收音机。铁路工厂钢铁构造工场的五百三十个工人中，就有七十三个人按月到银行去存款。不仅在业工人生活得到了改善，由于生产发展了，因而大批失业工人也有了工作。单是铁路工厂工人数量（连学徒在内）今年就比前年增加了一倍以上。
    计件工资制是怎样计算工资的呢？按工作性质来说，如油漆厂制罐筒，可以分成截铁板、滚身、翻边、成形等阶段，在这里就分阶段定单价（单位产品的工价）。但如各阶段紧密联系分不开，就以全过程定单价。按人来说，如裁玻璃是一人裁，就以个人计件。如铆钉，得有对眼、把钉、烧火等四个人协同动作，就集体计件（凡能个人计件者尽量作到个人计件）。另外如修理坏电滚，坏的程度不同，又需要赶快修好，就规定多少时间内修好一个，给多少工钱。在实行计件工资时，一般都以七级工资加百分之十当作本俸。单价就是根据本俸和产量定额来规定的。如裁玻璃，根据每天定额（定额一般的在一年之中不变动）二百八十平方米计算，一平方米需要一．七分钟，那么如果七级工人裁，一平方米的单价就是七级工人一．七分钟的本俸，六级工人裁，就是六级工人一．七分钟的本俸。如铆钉，四个工人级别不同，铆一百颗七分钉，需要一小时，那么铆这一百颗钉的单价就是这四个工人一小时本俸的总和。分配工资时就按各人本俸系数计算。这样，工人的等级高，多作活，就多挣钱。所以实行计件制的工厂，工人特别努力学技术，并且努力研究，提出合理化建议，以改良机器和工具。
    计件累进制是规定一定时间以内作多少件数，在规定数内按计件制算工钱，在规定时间内超过之数按一定的累进率算工钱。这是比单纯的计件制更能高度发挥工人的积极性和创造性的。
    生产愈发展，愈加看出七级制、超额累进奖薪制和计件工资制度的正确性。当初，中苏合营以外的公营工厂，所采取的不是这种工资制度，而是另一种平均主义的工资制度。按照后一种工资制度，一开始在生产尚未发展时，工人的工资就定得比较高，而且等级很多，有的工厂竟多到三四十级，而级与级之间则相差很少。这种工资制度，在一九四七年生产陷于停顿的最困难时期，由于照顾了广大工人的生活，救济了失业工人，曾得到一般工人的好感，并因此在相当程度内提高了工人们的阶级觉悟。但是由于没有把社会救济和工资从性质区别开来，不管工厂开工或停工，工人一样拿工钱和配给；又由于工资制度本身存在着平均主义的毛病，不能刺激生产和技术的发展，工人中流行着这样一句话：“技术不技术，反正挣钱差不多。”所以虽然有些工厂的生产也有发展，但是比起中苏合营的工厂来，发展速度还差得很远。如中苏合营的铁路工厂工人创造的价值去年比前年提高了百分之一百三十（以一个工人计算），而在公营的大连纺织厂，同时期内只增加了百分之六十四（以总数计算）。正因为如此，所以中苏合营工厂的工资逐渐上升，而其他公营工厂，工资就相对地下降。前者如铁路工厂工人最高工资在去年十月已升到合包米一百七十五斤（配给除外），后者如广和机械厂同时期的最高工资仍然只合一百三十六斤（配给除外），结果是，要再提高标准吧，与整个工业发展不相称，还怕影响成本。要不提高吧，工人不满意。后来，研究了中苏合营企业的工资制度，认识到它是根据“按劳给酬”的原则定出来的。毫无疑问，“按劳给酬”是应该成为新民主主义社会的工资原则的，因为只有这样才能鼓励生产力的提高，发展生产，从而改善工人的生活。摸到了这个诀窃，旅大公营企业从此便获得了刺激发展生产的有力因素。
    今年四月，旅大行政公署工业厅通令所属各工厂仿行中苏合营企业的按劳给酬的新工资制度。工人们普遍反应：“这一下八仙过海，可以各显神通了！”各厂负责人在通令下达后，经过向干部和工人进行讲解说明，立即以七级制为标准进行了评资运动，重新确定了工人的等级，初步定出了生产定额和产品规格。在这样的基础之上，并实行了超额累进奖薪制，逐步地进行了计件制和计件累进制。在改行新工资制的各工厂，工人们人人加油，个个积极，因此在第一个月，产量和质量就起了显著变化。如广源油脂工厂在实行计件累进制后，六月份大豆场的出油量就提高了百分之九十八。广和机械厂七月份开始改行计件制工人生怕产品不合规格，都仔细改进技术，结果七月份车床零件的废货从六月份的一百九十件降低到只有五件。金州纺织厂在九月份仅包扎用料等项就节约了关东券二百万元。
    截至目前为止，大连中苏合营以外的公营工厂几已全部改为七级工资制，并在百分之七十八的工人之中实行了计件制和计件累进制。各厂经过重新定等级后，许多普通工人的过高工资下降了，不少技术工人的工资却上升了。但是不仅技术工人得到了鼓励，普通工人的情绪也并没有因之降低。他们心里有数，明白实行超额累进奖薪制和计件制后，基本工资限制不了他们用提高技术来取得更高的报酬。果然不错，由于人人在技术上钻研，平均工资已开始上升。如广源油脂工厂六月份就比四月份多支出工资三十三万元以上。工厂呢？不仅没赔钱，反而因为单位产品的人工成本降低等原因而增加了三百六十余万元的收入。纺织厂则已消灭了棉花的浪费现象。
    但是，许多工厂在执行正确的工资制度中还存在着许多缺点和困难，需要继续加以研究改进。譬如需要继续克服个别干部中单纯迁就工人利益的观点，需要合理地确定统一的工人等级标准，规定正确的生产定额和产品规格，建立严密的检查制度和检查组织，改进会计制度等，只有这样，才能使工资制度更合理，更能鼓励工人积极改进技术，提高产品的数量和质量，减低成本，从而使大连的工业更加向前发展。
