　　Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Delivers Congratulatory Speech
　　[Beijing News] The full text of the congratulatory speech by Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, at the opening ceremony of the Asian Women's Representative Conference is as follows: Respected delegates and guests from various countries:
　　Today, on behalf of the two million people of Beijing, I extend warm greetings to the conference and to the delegates and guests from various countries who are fighting for the peace, democracy, and women's liberation of the world and defending the welfare of children! And I sincerely welcome the holding of this great Asian Women's Representative Conference in Beijing!
　　The successful convening of the Asian Women's Representative Conference is a result of the growing strength of the world's peace and democratic forces under the leadership of the Soviet Union and the development of the world's women's movement. The convening of this conference will enable women from Asian countries to exchange experiences in struggle, and will more closely link the struggle of women in the world with the struggle of people around the world to defend world peace and democracy. The people of the city consider it a great honor that a conference with such great historical and international significance can be held in Beijing!
　　This conference is being held in Beijing, the capital of New China, which has only recently been liberated and has just held its Second People's Representative Conference and First Women's Representative Congress. This will be of great help to the people of Beijing, especially the women. This will encourage the people and women of the city to further strive for the restoration and development of production, the construction of a new Beijing, and the complete liberation of China. In the nine months since liberation, 4,900 women in Beijing have been directly organized into production and work under the leadership of the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, and about 4,000 have been organized into study. The broad masses of women have begun to break feudal shackles, establish a new outlook on life, and begin a new life. In terms of maternal and child welfare work, the number of public and private nurseries in the city has increased from 11 to 43, and a new maternal and child health experimental zone has been established to conduct household surveys, disease investigations, maternal and child life education, and disease treatment in a step-by-step manner. The women of Beijing are on the road to liberation. The convening of the Asian Women's Representative Conference will give them the opportunity to receive a more profound internationalist education. They will further learn from the women of the advanced socialist country, the Soviet Union, and work together with their sisters around the world who are fighting for peace and democracy!
　　However, precisely because Beijing has not been liberated for long, and various construction projects have not yet been fully on track, we have not had time to prepare better conditions to welcome this great conference. We deeply regret this, but the people of the whole country have the confidence to overcome this shortcoming appropriately in the near future, because the people of the whole city are working hard on production and construction under the direct leadership of the people's leader Chairman Mao. All the women of Beijing will strive to implement all the resolutions and calls of the International Democratic Women's Federation and the Asian Women's Conference!
　　Finally, I wish the conference success!
　　Chen Shaomin, Representative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Delivers Congratulatory Speech
　　[Beijing News] The full text of the congratulatory speech by Chen Shaomin, representative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, at the opening ceremony of the Asian Women's Representative Conference is as follows:
　　With the most excitement and pleasure, I represent the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to celebrate the opening of the Asian Women's Representative Conference. The Chinese working class believes that the convening of the Asian Women's Representative Conference in Beijing, the capital of New China, is the glory of the Chinese people, the glory of Chinese women, and the glory of the Chinese working class. The women's movement and the workers' movement are inseparable. The Asian and Australasian Trade Union Representative Conference has just concluded victoriously in Beijing, and the Asian Women's Representative Conference has also opened in Beijing. This symbolizes the close connection between the workers' movement and the women's movement, and shows that the Asian people's liberation movement has been actively developing and growing in the unity of the broad masses of workers, women, and other progressive human beings. On behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, I pay tribute to the International Democratic Women's Federation, which leads the world's women's movement, to the advanced women of all countries who are resolutely fighting for lasting peace and people's democracy, and to the Asian women who are engaged in a heroic struggle for national liberation and democratic freedom, and to all the delegates attending this conference!
　　Today, the cause of liberation of the Chinese people has achieved a basic victory, and Chinese women have also been liberated along with the liberation of the entire people. The birth of the People's Republic of China, the formulation of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, especially the clear provisions on the equal rights of women in political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life in the program, and its inclusion as one of the general programs, have made the status of Chinese women unprecedentedly and clearly elevated. The reason why Chinese women have been able to achieve these victories is because Chinese women have actively participated in the Chinese people's liberation struggle, and have closely combined the struggle for their own liberation with the cause of liberation of the people of the whole country; it is because Chinese women have always adhered to Mao Zedong's line in their own struggle, and have accepted the most resolute, bravest, and most selfless leadership of the working class and its political party—the Chinese Communist Party; it is because the liberation struggle of Chinese women has been supported by the working class and women and advanced people of the whole world, headed by the Soviet Union, who are fighting for international peace and people's democracy. If there were no great liberation of the entire Chinese people, no wise and far-sighted leadership of the Communist Party, and no support from international peace and democratic forces, it would be impossible to achieve the liberation of women.
　　In the cause of their own and the entire nation's liberation, Chinese women have carried out heroic and unyielding arduous struggles in various different posts. Many outstanding members have joined the guerrilla war and the People's Liberation Army, fighting side by side with men in front of or behind enemy lines, and have produced many famous female guerrilla fighters and female combat heroes. The broad masses of rural women not only worked hard and shouldered the main responsibility for rural production, but also participated in various kinds of work to support the front lines like men. In particular, many female workers, before the liberation of the cities, carried out arduous and difficult struggles against the enemy in various ways, opposing the cruel exploitation and oppression of imperialism and bureaucratic capital, opposing their sabotage of factories, protecting the property of the state, and cooperating with the offensive of the People's Liberation Army. Because Chinese women know that without armed struggle, it is impossible to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs, and it is impossible to win the liberation of the people of the whole country and all women. After liberation, female workers actively participated in inventory and acceptance work, worked hard in production as masters of the country, and emerged with many female model workers. Chinese women have played an active role in the construction of New China's political, economic, cultural, and educational undertakings. While carrying out this arduous work, they have also waged an irreconcilable struggle against the conservative thinking and dependence left to them by the old society. The women of New China have already stood up with the Chinese people. The new China will be built into an independent, democratic, united, peaceful, prosperous, and strong new China because a large number of progressive women participate in the construction work, so as to quickly restore the wounds of war.
　　Comrades, Soviet women have long been liberated, and women in North China, North Korea, and Mongolia have also been liberated. We believe that under the leadership of the International Democratic Women's Federation and under the direct leadership of the Asian Women's Representative Conference, Chinese women will surely be able to unite closely with their sisters in various Asian countries, struggle for the thorough liberation of the people of all Asian countries, and be able to achieve their own liberation at the same time as the liberation of the people of all Asian countries.
　　We, the Chinese working class, especially female workers, warmly wish the conference success.
　　Long live the International Democratic Women's Federation!
　　Long live the success of the Asian Women's Representative Conference!
　　Long live Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people!
　　Long live Marshal Stalin, the revolutionary teacher of the people of the world!
　　Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Delivers Congratulatory Speech
　　[Beijing News] The full text of the congratulatory speech by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, at the opening ceremony of the Asian Women's Representative Conference is as follows: Chairman, delegates, and guests from various countries:
　　Today, the Asian Women's Representative Conference is opening in Beijing, the capital of our people, and I represent the literary and art circles of all of China to express congratulations. I respectfully wish the conference a victorious progress and great achievements! I respectfully wish all the delegates and guests good health!
　　The purpose of the conference is to awaken and unite the women of all of Asia to jointly oppose the shackles of feudalism and the aggression of imperialism, so as to strive for the welfare of women and children in all of Asia, the independence and liberation of the oppressed nations of the Far East, and the lasting peace of the people of the world.
　　This purpose is very far-reaching, but it is bound to be successful!
　　Women suffer the greatest oppression and the deepest suffering in any nation.
　　All those who suffer the greatest oppression and the deepest suffering, as long as they are awakened and united, their resistance will be the strongest and their struggle will be the sharpest.
　　Therefore, the awakening and unity of the women's world is a great force that cannot be underestimated.
　　Hasn't the International Democratic Women's Federation had very heroic and excellent performances in the cause of striving for people's democracy and striving for world peace? Isn't that the best proof?
　　Today, we Asian women have awakened from the dual oppression of feudalism and imperialism and have embarked on the road of unity. This shows infinite light in our future of striving for people's democracy and world peace, and our strength has been strengthened immeasurably.
　　Asia is the base camp of feudalism and the lifeline of imperialism.
　　The awakening and unity of Asian women means the collapse of the base camp of feudalism from its foundation and the complete severance of the lifeline of imperialism.
　　Imperialism mainly relies on the exploitation of colonies to maintain its life. Imperialism urgently needs colonial Asia, and even more urgently needs Asian feudalism to consolidate its colonial rule.
　　When Asian feudalism is overthrown and Asian women and Asian people are liberated from the shackles of colonialism together, the life of imperialism will lose its last sustenance, and the hope of world peace will gain its final guarantee.
　　From now on, the strength of our anti-imperialist democratic peace camp has indeed been strengthened immeasurably due to the awakening and unity of Asian women.
　　We earnestly hope that this awakening can be further promoted and improved.
　　We earnestly hope that this unity can be further expanded and consolidated.
　　We earnestly hope that all of us Asian women can organically combine with the International Democratic Women's Federation, so that all Asian women can become fighters for people's democracy and vanguards in striving for lasting world peace.
　　Long live the unity and progress of Asian women!
　　Long live the liberation of all oppressed nations in the world!
　　Long live lasting world peace and the victory of people's democracy!
　　Yang Gang, Representative of the International Association of Journalists, Delivers Congratulatory Speech
　　[Beijing News] The full text of the congratulatory speech by Yang Gang, representative of the International Association of Journalists, at the opening ceremony of the Asian Women's Representative Conference is as follows:
　　Presidium and all delegates of the Asian Women's Representative Conference! Dear sisters!
　　On behalf of the International Association of Journalists, I pay tribute to all the delegates attending the Asian Women's Representative Conference and the executive members of the International Democratic Women's Federation!
　　In the four years since its birth, the International Democratic Women's Federation has led women all over the world in a great struggle against fascism, for lasting world peace, and for the democratic rights of women and children, giving the imperialists and their reactionary agents among various nations a serious blow, thus strengthening the world's democratic peace camp led by the Soviet Union, and strengthening the unity of women all over the world.
　　More than half of the world's women, especially women in colonial and semi-colonial countries, have been unable to send representatives to gather together due to the oppression, blockade, and obstruction of imperialists and domestic reactionaries in various countries. Today, not only are there representatives of women of various Asian nations, but also representatives of sisters from Europe, Africa, and the Americas, holding this historically significant conference in the capital of the People's Republic of China, which most powerfully proves that the strength of the world's democratic women and all progressive people has been unprecedentedly strengthened. We believe that due to the convening of this conference, the combat solidarity between women of various Asian nations, as well as between Asian women and women of the world, will be further consolidated and close. One of the highest tasks of the tens of thousands of progressive journalists of various countries united in the International Association of Journalists is: "To make newspapers a powerful weapon to advocate and organize opposition to new world wars and all forms of fascism."
　　Dear sisters! We will continue to use our journalistic weapons, and together with you, resolutely and effectively oppose our common enemies—imperialist aggressors, instigators of new world wars, and all anti-people evil forces, further consolidate the camp of lasting world peace and people's democracy, and realize the independence, liberation, freedom, democracy, and happy life of all nations!
　　Long live the success of the Asian Women's Representative Conference!
　　Long live the cause of unity and liberation of Asian women and women all over the world!
　　Long live the International Democratic Women's Federation!
　　Congratulatory Message from the World Federation of Democratic Youth
　　[Beijing News] The full text of the congratulatory message from the World Federation of Democratic Youth to the Asian Women's Representative Conference is as follows:
　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth expresses the congratulations of 60 million young people around the world to the Asian Women's Representative Conference organized by the International Women's Federation.
　　We believe that this conference will make a great contribution to the struggle of Asian women for women's rights, democracy, national independence, and lasting peace.
　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth looks forward with great hope to the results of this historically significant conference, which marks the organized determination of all nations in Asia to end the rule of foreign imperialism on this vast continent and has taken a major step forward. The victorious liberation of China and the establishment of the People's Republic of China clearly point out that the struggle of the freedom-loving people of Asia, together with the forces of peace and democracy in the world, is stronger than the imperialists and their henchmen. The imperialists and their henchmen have plunged Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaya, and Burma into the flames of wars of plunder, and they are attempting to turn Japan into a fascist militarist state to prepare for the Anglo-American imperialist war. There is no doubt that this conference held in Beijing, the capital of New China, will help all nations in Asia to fully move towards a future without war, enslavement, and hardship!
　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth's determination to fight for peace has been further strengthened by the brilliant achievements of the World Youth and Student Festival and the resolutions of the Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. They are watching the struggle of Asian women organized under the banner of the International Democratic Women's Federation with envious eyes. We are convinced that this conference will consolidate the active cooperation of democratic forces between youth and women and between the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the member states of the International Democratic Women's Federation.
　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth congratulates the success of the Asian Women's Representative Conference. Long live the International Democratic Women's Federation!

　　Congratulatory Message from Mrs. Gordon, President of the International Democratic Women's Federation
　　[Beijing News] The full text of the congratulatory message from Mrs. Gordon, President of the International Democratic Women's Federation, to the Asian Women's Representative Conference is as follows: Dear Chinese women:
　　Your beautiful land, which has produced many great thinkers and beautiful artists, is what I have always dreamed of knowing. But my wish has never been as strong as it is today; because today, after years of struggle and pain, you have finally lifted all oppression and recreated China's unity.
　　I am particularly proud that women have so bravely joined men in the task of liberating their motherland and have achieved victory, while also achieving their own liberation.
　　Although I cannot be there in person to warmly congratulate you, please believe that my heart is always thinking of every stage of your work and various gatherings filled with friendship. I want to join you in paying tribute to the delegates of the Asian Women's Representative Conference, to whom the International Women's Federation has entrusted important tasks.
　　I know very well that the prestige of your success will play a very great exemplary role for the women of all oppressed countries, and it is also a great encouragement.
　　For the success of this Asian Women's Representative Conference, I thank Comrade Cai Chang and the efforts of Chinese women.
　　Joint Congratulatory Message from Various Groups in Beijing
　　[Beijing News] The full text of the joint congratulatory message from the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Democratic Youth Federation, the Student Federation, and the Preparatory Committee of the Educational Workers' Trade Union to the Asian Women's Representative Conference is as follows: Dear delegates, dear sisters:
　　On behalf of the workers, women, youth, teachers, and students of Beijing, I extend warm congratulations to your conference, which is related to the cause of human peace and women's liberation!
　　You are either from the great bulwark of peace, the socialist Soviet Union, or from the new democratic countries, or from the colonial and semi-colonial countries that are bravely fighting against imperialism and domestic reactionaries; you are the glorious spokespersons of hundreds of millions of women in Asia, and you are gathering here to exchange experiences, discuss the peace and democratic movement of Asian women and their own liberation cause, and discuss the health and welfare of children; your meeting has strengthened the democratic forces of the world and promoted the world peace movement.
　　Thanks to the wise leadership of Marshal Stalin, the great teacher of all mankind, and Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, and thanks to the indomitable struggle of the people of the world, the forces of imperialism have been greatly weakened, the Chinese people's revolution has achieved a rapid and brilliant victory, and we have been able to have such unprecedented glory to receive you. Today, we have prepared twenty-six flags to present to the representatives of each country to express our highest respect. Please bring our greetings and respect to the sisters and brothers of your countries.
　　Liberated Beijing has been transformed from a fortress of feudal emperors and warlord bureaucrats into the capital of the people. We have already elected our own mayor and the People's Municipal Government half a month ago. At the same time, the People's Government has implemented the will of the people, closed all the brothels in Beijing, and liberated more than 1,200 sisters who have been insulted and harmed for a long time. From now on, this most dirty and barbaric system in the old society will never exist in the capital of the people. We, the people of Beijing, have begun to grasp our own political power and participate in the construction of our motherland as masters.
　　Dear delegates, we, the women, workers, farmers, youth, teachers, and students of Beijing, feel great joy and pride that you are meeting in this former imperial palace, today's People's Hall. We welcome you, pay tribute to you, and wish the conference success!
　　Long live the unity of women all over the world!
　　Long live the International Democratic Women's Federation!
　　Long live Marshal Stalin, the great teacher of mankind!
　　Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!

　　祝贺亚洲妇代会议开幕
  　北京市副市长吴晗祝词
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府吴晗副市长在亚洲妇女代表会议开幕式上的祝词全文如下：敬爱的各国代表和各国来宾：
    我今天代表北京市二百万人民向大会和为全世界和平民主妇女解放，保卫儿童福利而斗争的各国代表和来宾们致热烈的敬礼！并热诚地欢迎这个伟大的亚洲妇女代表会议在北京召开！
    亚洲妇女代表会议能够胜利召开是由于在苏联领导之下的世界各国和平民主力量壮大和世界妇女运动发展的结果，这个会议的召开将使亚洲各国妇女交流斗争经验，使世界妇女的斗争和世界人民保卫世界和平民主的斗争更密切地联系起来，对于具有如此伟大历史意义和国际意义的会议，能在北京召开，全市人民引为极大的荣幸！
    这个会议在才解放不久，在才开过第二届人民代表会议和第一次妇女代表大会的新中国首都北京召开，对北京市人民尤其是妇女们，将有极大的帮助。这将鼓舞全市人民和妇女更进一步为恢复与发展生产，建设新北京，彻底解放全中国而奋斗。北京市的妇女在解放后的九个月中，直接在市民主妇联领导下组织到生产和工作中的已有四千九百人，组织在学习中的约有四千人，广大妇女开始打破封建束缚，建立了新人生观，开始了新的生活。妇婴福利工作方面，在全市公私立托儿所已由十一处增加至四十三处，新举办了妇婴卫生实验区，有步骤地进行家庭状况，疾病调查，妇婴生活教育和疾病治疗，北京市的妇女正在走向解放的道路。亚洲妇女代表会议的召开，则将使他们有机会接受更深刻的国际主义教育，她们将更进一步向先进社会主义国家苏联妇女学习，和世界各国为和平民主而奋斗的姊妹共同努力携手前进！
    但正由于北京市解放不久，各项建设还没有完全上轨道，所以来不及准备更好的条件来迎接这个伟大的会议。这是我们深感歉仄的，但全国人民有信心在不久之后就能适当地克服这缺点，因为全市人民正在人民领袖毛主席直接领导下努力生产建设工作，全北京市的妇女将为贯彻国际民主妇联和亚洲妇女会议的一切决议和号召而努力！
    最后谨祝大会成功！
  　中华全总代表陈少敏祝词
    【北京讯】中华全国总工会代表陈少敏在亚洲妇女代表会议开幕式上的祝词全文如下：
    我以最兴奋和最愉快的心情，代表中华全国总工会来庆祝亚洲妇女代表会议的开幕。中国工人阶级认为亚洲妇女代表会议能在新中国的首都北京召开是中国人民的光荣，是中国妇女的光荣，也是中国工人阶级的光荣。妇女运动和工人运动是不可分开的。亚澳工会代表会议刚刚在北京胜利的结束，亚洲妇女代表会议又在北京开幕，这象征着工人运动与妇女运动之间的密切联系，并显现了亚洲人民的解放运动已经在广大的工人和妇女及其他进步人类的团结当中，积极发展壮大起来了。我代表中华全国总工会向领导全世界妇女运动的国际民主妇联致敬，向为持久和平与人民民主坚决斗争的各国先进妇女致敬，向为着民族解放、民主自由而进行英勇斗争的亚洲妇女及出席这次大会的诸位代表致敬！
    今天中国人民的解放事业，已经获得了基本的胜利，中国妇女也随着整个人民的解放，得到了解放。中华人民共和国的诞生，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的制定，特别在纲领上对于妇女政治、经济、文化教育和社会生活的平等权利的明确规定，并且列为总纲之一，使得中国妇女的地位空前的，明确的提高起来。中国妇女之所以能获得这些胜利，是因为中国妇女积极参加了中国人民的解放斗争，把争取妇女自身的解放和争取全国人民的解放事业紧紧地结合在一起；是因为中国妇女在自己的斗争中一向坚持了毛泽东的路线，接受了最坚决、最勇敢、最大公无私的工人阶级及其政党——中国共产党的英明领导；是因为中国妇女的解放斗争得到了以苏联为首的、为国际和平与人民民主而斗争的全世界工人阶级和妇女以及先进人民的支持。假使没有整个中国人民的大解放，没有共产党英明的、有远见的领导，没有国际和平民主力量的支持，要想求得妇女的解放是不可能的。
    中国妇女在自身和全民族解放的事业里，曾经在各个不同的岗位上进行了英勇不屈的艰若斗争，许多优秀分子参加了游击战争，参加了人民解放军，在敌前或敌后，一直和男人并肩作战，产生了许多有名的女游击队员和女战斗英雄。广大的农村妇女，不但努力劳动，担负起农村生产的主要责任，而且和男人一样的参加了支援前线的各种工作。尤其许多女工们，在城市解放以前，就和敌人用各种方式进行了艰若卓绝的斗争，反对帝国主义和官僚资本的残酷剥削压迫，反对他们破坏工厂，保护了国家的财产，配合了人民解放军的进攻。因为中国妇女知道，不进行武装斗争，是无法推翻帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治，是无法争取到全国人民和全体妇女的解放的。在解放以后，女工们又积极参加清点接收工作，以国家主人翁的姿态努力生产，涌现出了许多女劳动模范。中国的妇女在新中国的政治、经济、文化教育建设事业中都发挥了积极的作用。她们在进行这种艰若工作的同时，还向着旧社会所遗留给自己的保守思想和依赖性，进行了不调和的斗争。新中国的妇女，已经和中国人民一起站立起来了。新的中国会因广大的进步的妇女参加建设工作，以便迅速恢复战争的创伤，建立成为一个独立、民主、统一、和平、富强的新中国。
    同志们，苏联妇女已经早就解放了，中国、朝鲜北部、蒙古的妇女也已解放了。我们相信在国际民主妇联的领导下，在亚洲妇女代表会议的直接领导下，中国的妇女一定能和亚洲各国的姊妹们亲密的团结起来，为争取亚洲各国人民的澈底解放而斗争，并一定能够在亚洲各国人民解放的同时，获得自己的解放。
    我们中国工人阶级，尤其是女工，热烈地预祝大会的成功。
    国际民主妇联万岁！
    亚洲妇女代表会议成功万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    全世界人民革命导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
  　全国文联主席郭沫若祝词
    【北京讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若在亚洲妇女代表会议开幕式上的祝词全文如下：主席，各位代表和各国来宾：
    今天亚洲妇女代表大会在我们的人民首都北京开幕，我代表着全中国的文艺界来表示庆贺。敬祝大会的胜利进行，并获得伟大的成就！敬祝各位代表和来宾的健康！
    大会的目的是要唤起并团结全亚洲的妇女，共同反对封建主义的束缚、帝国主义的侵略，以争取全亚洲的妇女和儿童的福利，远东各被压迫民族的独立和解放，全世界人民的持久和平。
    这目的是很远大的，然而是一定可以成功的！
    妇女在任何民族中所受的压迫最大，所受的痛苦也最深。
    凡是受压迫最大、受痛苦最深的人，只要一有了觉醒，而且而了团结，她的反抗力也就最强，斗争性也就最尖锐。
    因而妇女界的觉醒和团结是不可轻侮的一个伟大的力量。
    国际民主妇联在争取人民民主，争取世界和平的事业中，有了很英勇、很优秀的表现，不就是极好的证明吗？
    今天我们亚洲妇女从封建主义和帝国主义的双重压迫之下，觉醒了起来，而且走上了团结的道路。这在我们争取人民民主和世界和平的前途是现出了无限的光明，我们的力量是无比地加强了。
    亚洲是封建主义的大本营，帝国主义的生命线。
    亚洲妇女的觉醒和团结，这就意味着封建主义大本营的从基底上的崩溃，帝国主义生命线的彻底断送。
    帝国主义主要是靠着殖民地的剥削来维持它的生命的。帝国主义迫切地需要殖民地的亚洲，更迫切地需要亚洲的封建主义以巩固其殖民地的统治。
    亚洲的封建主义打倒了，亚洲妇女和亚洲人民一道从殖民地的枷锁下解放了出来，帝国主义的生命就失掉了它的最后的寄托，世界和平的希望也就获得了它的最后的保障了。
    今后我们反帝国主义的民主和平阵营的力量，由于亚洲妇女的觉醒和团结，的确是无比地加强了。
    我们热烈地希望：这觉醒能够更加推广和提高。
    我们热烈地希望：这团结能够更加扩大和巩固。
    我们热烈地希望：我们全亚洲妇女能够和国际民主妇联有机地结合起来，使亚洲妇女全都成为人民民主的斗士，争取世界持久和平的急先锋。
    全亚洲妇女团结进步万岁！
    全世界被压迫民族解放万岁！
    持久的世界和平与人民民主胜利万岁！
  　国际记者协会代表杨刚祝词
    【北京讯】国际记者协会代表杨刚在亚洲妇女代表会议开幕式上的祝词全文如下：
    亚洲妇女代表会议主席团和全体代表们！亲爱的姊妹们！
    我代表国际记者协会向出席亚洲妇女代表会议的全体代表和国际民主妇女联合会的执行委员们致敬！
    国际民主妇女联合会自诞生以来的四年中间，领导着全世界妇女进行反对法西斯、争取世界的持久和平、和保卫妇女儿童的民主权利的伟大斗争，给予帝国主义及其在各民族中间的反动代理人以严重的打击，因而加强了以苏联为领袖的全世界民主和平阵营，加强了全世界妇女的团结。
    占全世界妇女半数以上的亚洲妇女们，特别是殖民地半殖民地的妇女们，由于帝国主义者和各国国内反动派的压迫、封锁、阻挠，曾经是不可能派遣代表聚首一堂的。今天，不仅有亚洲各民族的妇女代表，而且还有欧洲、非洲和美洲的姊妹们的代表，在中华人民共和国的首都，举行这个富有历史意义的会议，就最有力地证明：世界民主妇女和全体进步人民的力量是空前壮大了。我们相信，由于这次会议的召开，亚洲各民族妇女之间、以及亚洲妇女和全世界妇女的战斗团结，必将更进一步巩固和亲密起来。团结在国际记者协会中的数以万计的各国的进步新闻工作者的一个最高任务就是：“使报纸成为鼓吹并组织反对新的世界战争和一切形式的法西斯主义的有力武器。”
    亲爱的姊妹们！我们将继续运用我们的新闻武器，和你们在一起，坚决有效地反对我们的共同敌人——帝国主义侵略者、新的世界战争的挑拨者和一切反人民的恶势力，进一步巩固世界持久和平和人民民主的阵营，来实现各个民族的独立、解放、自由、民主和幸福的生活！
    亚洲妇女代表会议成功万岁！
    亚洲妇女和全世界妇女团结解放事业万岁！
    国际民主妇女联合会万岁！
  　世界民主青联祝词
    【北京讯】世界民主青年联盟致亚洲妇女代表会议的祝词全文如下：
    世界民主青年联盟向国际妇女联合会组织的亚洲妇女代表会议表达全世界六千万青年的祝贺。
    我们相信这个大会将对亚洲妇女为争取妇女权利、民主、民族独立和持久和平的斗争有着伟大的贡献。
    世界民主青年以极大的希望期待着这个有历史意义的大会的结果，它标志着亚洲一切民族对结束外国帝国主义在这个广阔大陆上的统治底有组织的决心，并向前迈进了一大步。中国胜利的解放和中华人民共和国的建立，明显地指出爱好自由的亚洲人民，与全世界的和平与民主力量在一起所进行的斗争，是比帝国主义者和他们的走卒更强大的。帝国主义者及其走卒使越南、印度尼西亚、马来亚和缅甸卷入掠夺战争的火焰中，他们企图使日本变成法西斯军国主义的国家以准备英美的帝国主义战争。毫无疑问，在新中国首都北京召开的这个大会，将帮助亚洲一切民族全面地向着没有战争，奴役和困苦的将来而前进！
    世界民主青年为和平而斗争的决心，由于世界青年和学生联欢节的光辉成就与世界民主青年联盟的第二次代表大会决议，已进一步地加强了。他们以羡慕的眼光注视着组织在国际民主妇女联合会旗帜下的亚洲妇女的斗争。我们确信，这个大会将巩固青年和妇女之间的以及世界民主青年联盟和国际民主妇联各会员国之间的民主力量的积极合作。
    世界民主青年联盟祝贺亚洲妇女代表会议的成功。国际民主妇联万岁！

  　国际妇联主义戈登夫人祝词
    【北京讯】国际民主妇联主席戈登夫人致亚洲妇女代表会议的祝词全文如下：亲爱的中国妇女们：
    你们曾产生过许多伟大的思想家和优美的艺术家的美丽的国土，是我一向所梦想认识的。但我的愿望从来没有象今天这样强烈；因为今天你们经过多年的斗争和痛苦以后，终于解除了一切压迫，再创造了中国的团结一致。
    妇女们曾这样英勇地同男子们一道担任解放祖国的任务，而获得胜利，同时也获得她们自己的解放，这是我特别感到骄傲的。
    我虽然现在不能亲来向你们热烈地祝贺，但是请你们相信我的心，对于你们的工作每一阶段，和各种友情洋溢着的集会，都是时时念念不忘的。我要同你们一起向国际妇联寄与重大任务的亚洲妇女代表会议的各位代表们致敬。
    我很知道，你们成功的威信，对于各被压迫国家的妇女起一种很伟大的模范作用，同时也是一种巨大的鼓励。
    为这一次的亚洲妇女代表会议的成功，我谢谢蔡畅同志和中国妇女们的努力。
  　京市各团体联合祝词
    【北京讯】北京市民主妇联、市总工会、市农会筹委会、民主青年联合会、学生联合会、教育工作者工会筹委会联衔致亚洲妇女代表会议的祝词全文如下：亲爱的代表们，亲爱的姊妹们：
    我代表北京市的工人，妇女，青年，教师和学生，向你们正在进行的，关系着人类和平与妇女解放事业的大会致热烈的祝贺！
    你们或来自伟大的和平保垒社会主义苏联，或来自新民主主义国家，或来自那正向帝国主义与国内反动派英勇斗争的殖民地半殖民地国家；你们是亚洲几万万妇女的光荣的发言人，你们在这里聚首一堂，交流经验，讨论亚洲妇女的和平民主运动与自身的解放事业，讨论孩子们的健康和福利的问题；你们的会议加强了世界民主力量，推进了世界和平运动。
    感谢全人类伟大导师斯大林大元帅和中国人民领袖毛泽东主席的英明领导，感谢全世界人民的不屈不挠的斗争，使帝国主义势力大大地消弱，使中国人民革命得到迅速的辉煌的胜利，使我们能有如此空前的荣耀来接待你们。今天我们预备了二十六面旗子，献给每一国家的代表，以表示我们崇高的敬意。请把我们的问候和敬意带给你们国家的姊妹兄弟们。
    解放了的北京已经从封建帝王和军阀官僚的堡垒变成人民的首都了。我们已经在半个月前，选举了自己的市长，选举了人民的市政府。同时，人民政府执行了人民的意旨，封闭了北京所有妓院，解放了一千二百多长期被污辱被损害的姊妹们，从此，这个旧社会中最肮脏的野蛮的制度永远不再存在于人民的首都了。我们，北京的人民，已开始掌握了自己的政权，以主人翁的地位来参加祖国建设了。
    亲爱的代表们，你们在这旧日的帝王宫殿、今天的人民礼堂开会，我们，北京的妇女、工人、农民、青年和教师、学生感到莫大的欢欣与骄傲。我们欢迎你们，向你们致敬，并祝大会成功！
    全世界妇女团结万岁！
    国际民主妇联万岁！
    伟大的人类导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
