(TASS Sofia, December 14th) During the trial of Traicho Kostov and his accomplices on December 12th, the prosecutor presented several documents to the court concerning the defendants' crimes. After the defendants' lawyers also presented relevant documents, Chief Magistrate Boris Lochanov declared:

    "Considering that the documents presented by the prosecutor and the defendants' lawyers may be important for a correct verdict in this case, the court deems it possible to record these documents in the judgment to be passed in this case. Thus, the court's investigation is considered complete."

    The Chief Magistrate then invited Chief Prosecutor Vladigor Dimchev to speak. The prosecutor said:

    Comrades! The investigation by the court into the treason case of Traicho Kostov and his accomplices has clearly demonstrated that the purpose of this conspiracy we are dealing with is to overthrow the state power legally established in our country by force and to undermine national independence and state sovereignty.

    　　　　Conspiracy to Infringe on Bulgarian Territory and Physically Eliminate Bulgarian People's Leader Dimitrov

    The purpose pursued by this conspiracy we are dealing with is to sever a part of the territory of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and offer it to other countries, thereby infringing on the territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. The purpose of this conspiracy is also to physically eliminate Comrade Georgi Dimitrov, Premier of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the leader and mentor of our people.

    It has been determined that the culprits and instigators of this conspiracy are lackeys of Britain and the United States, and these traitors had hoped for military intervention from Tito's Yugoslavia.

    This conspiracy is part of the conspiracy and hostile policy pursued by the Anglo-American imperialist bloc against our people's democratic regime and national independence and state sovereignty.

    Moreover, from an international perspective, this conspiracy against Bulgaria is part of the Anglo-American imperialists' conspiracy against the people's democratic countries of Southeastern Europe. The Anglo-American imperialists are using the traitor Tito and his espionage partners as the main tools to realize this conspiracy plan.

    This aggressive policy of the Anglo-American imperialists towards Southeastern Europe began during World War II with Churchill's plan to open a second front, not in the West but in the Balkans, with the aim of occupying the Balkan countries under the pretext of liberating them from the rule of the Hitler occupation forces. However, as is well known, this plan was not realized, or more precisely, it was only partially realized later, only in Greece, which is still occupied by Anglo-American troops today and has virtually lost her national independence.

    Anglo-American troops were prepared to occupy Yugoslavia, as well as Bulgaria and other countries in Southeastern and Central Europe, but their plans were foiled by the glorious victory of the heroic Soviet army, which liberated these countries from the clutches of the German occupation forces, thereby enabling the people of these countries to establish a truly democratic regime in their own country and embark on the path of socialist construction.

    The Anglo-American imperialists are not reconciled to this situation in the Balkans and the Danube Basin, namely, that the people's democratic countries have freed themselves from dependence on imperialism. The political and economic independence of the people's democratic countries is a thorn in the side of the imperialists. They want to see these countries in the same position as royalist-fascist Greece is now, that is to say, they dream of turning these countries into their colonies and undermining their national independence.

    The Western imperialists, especially the Anglo-American imperialists, cannot bear to watch how our country, after winning victory on September 9, 1944, is building a new democratic republic; with the help of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, this new democratic republic is growing stronger day by day and is developing in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. The imperialists are not reconciled to losing their predatory control over many countries after World War II, countries which the great Soviet army—the liberator—freed from the shackles of the Hitler aggressors. The imperialists also cannot bear to watch how these countries, thanks to the Soviet Union's selfless assistance, are rapidly moving towards socialism. The imperialists are doing everything possible to obstruct the peaceful and victorious development of the Bulgarian people and the people of other people's democratic countries along the path of democracy and socialism.

    This is precisely the starting point of the Anglo-American imperialists' subversive conspiracy policy towards our country and other people's democratic countries, and this is precisely the starting point of the so-called "covert aggression" and "internal aggression" policies.

    The lackeys of Britain and the United States are trying to recruit forces for their "internal aggression" from the fascist and reactionary groups in these countries, from the enemies of the people's democratic regime. The conspirators' sinister attempt to restore the old reactionary royalist-fascist regimes in the people's democratic countries by means of despicable coups is well known to everyone. The criminal gang of Maniu and Mihalache in Romania, the Ferenc Nagy gang in Hungary, Mikolajczyk in Poland, and the military-fascist conspiracy that occurred in Czechoslovakia in February 1948 all harbored this intention. In our country, several military-fascist organizations, such as "Kru Wang," "Neutral Officers," and others, harbored this conspiracy. This is also the sinister scheme harbored by those traitors—the well-known Anglo-American spies Getov, Nikola Petkov, Kosta Lulchev, and others.

    In our country and other people's democratic countries, all these conspiracies were organized under the direction and with the help of Anglo-American intelligence agencies. We have abundant facts to convincingly prove that many clues to the conspiracies and anti-government activities in the people's democratic countries lead directly to the embassies of the United States, Britain, and Yugoslavia stationed in these countries. In this trial, many such facts have also been mentioned. In this regard, it must be emphasized that even today, the number of personnel in the US and British embassies in Bulgaria is excessively large, which is completely disproportionate to the negligible official business handled by these embassies in our country. Our public has the right to ask: Strictly speaking, what are so many people doing in the above-mentioned embassies? After the attempts of the US and British intelligence agencies to organize and instigate reactionary and fascist forces against the People's Republic of Bulgaria were declared a failure, they began to pin their hopes on a group of conspirators headed by Traicho Kostov, who had been carrying out the espionage missions entrusted to them for a long time. In their conspiracy plan against our country, the Anglo-American imperialists used the traitorous Tito espionage gang as their main weapon.

    We see from the materials of this trial that Kadel, Djilas, Tito, and Rankovic frequently demanded that Traicho Kostov, the leader of the conspiratorial group's center, act quickly and decisively.

    In order for us to clearly understand the role played by the Tito gang in the conspiracy against our country, it is first necessary to accurately clarify its relationship with the Anglo-American imperialists. We know that this relationship has been well established in the trials of Rajk and Brankov in Budapest.

    As early as during the war, the Tito gang turned to Britain and the United States. The Tito gang obtained the leadership of the Communist Party by deceptive means, and then seized power in Yugoslavia. Thus, the independence of the Yugoslav people and the Yugoslav state was sold by the Tito elements to the Anglo-American imperialists.

    The British intelligence service, which has the most experience in this regard, first began working among the Tito elements, and soon the American intelligence agency followed suit. The British intelligence service correctly saw that Tito was a reliable and stubborn Trotskyist. The British intelligence service was convinced that Tito, together with the Trotskyists Rankovic, Djilas, Kadel, and others, would carry out the Anglo-American imperialist aggression policy in Yugoslavia and other Balkan and Danube River countries. The Tito gang fully proved that this hope was well-founded, and they played the despicable role of lackeys of the Anglo-American imperialists.

    But the sinister plans of the Anglo-American imperialists were not limited to Yugoslavia alone. The Tito elements were given the task of carrying out subversive work in other people's democratic countries and trying to establish their own agencies in these countries.

    In order to achieve this goal, the Tito elements launched extensive activities in Bulgaria. Their tasks have been clearly defined by the lackeys of Britain and the United States. They must infiltrate the Bulgarian Communist Party. In this regard, Traicho Kostov and his accomplices became their suitable allies.

    Traicho Kostov had long gained the trust of the British intelligence service. In fact, the British intelligence service had persuaded Nikola Jeshev to recruit Traicho Kostov as an agent of the fascist police.

    Acted as an Anglo-American Tito Lackey to Establish a Conspiracy Organization

    Shortly after September 9, 1944, Traicho Kostov met with Colonel Byrnes of the British intelligence service. After the initial meeting, Traicho Kostov unhesitatingly became a lackey of the British intelligence service. There was harmony and agreement between Traicho Kostov and his accomplices and the representatives of the Anglo-American intelligence agencies. Traicho Kostov and his accomplices enthusiastically carried out the instructions of the Anglo-American intelligence agencies. In order to realize the specific tasks they had accepted, Traicho Kostov and his accomplices organized illegal conspiracy organizations and their branches. All the defendants began to engage in work that harmed the national independence of our country as Tito's lackeys, in other words, as lackeys of the Anglo-American intelligence agencies, and began to work to separate Bulgaria from the Soviet Union, despite the fact that they all understood and deeply knew that the Bulgarian people were able to win victory on September 9, 1944, entirely due to the decisive assistance of the Soviet army; despite the fact that the establishment and consolidation of our people's democratic country was due to the huge, generous, and selfless assistance given and still being given by the Soviet Union; despite the fact that the progress of our economy, culture, and politics was due to our friendly relations and cooperation with the Soviet Union; despite the fact that the maintenance of our independence and our national sovereignty has proved to be possible and has become possible entirely due to the protection given to us by the Soviet Union.

    All the defendants fully recognized the harm they had caused to our people and our country and the harm they had caused to the cause of peace and democracy due to their treasonous espionage and subversive activities.

    Today, every patriot and every honest Bulgarian citizen knows that the friendship and cooperation between our country and the Soviet Union is the guarantee of our national independence, our national sovereignty, and the peaceful development of our culture and economy. The Soviet Union is not only the guarantee of our country but also of all people's democratic countries to move forward along the path of progress and socialism. The Soviet Union is the hope and inspiration for the liberation of all enslaved and oppressed countries in the world. The defendants clearly understood this, but despite this, they still wanted to isolate our country from the Soviet Union and wanted to establish a hostile bloc against the Soviet people.

    The prosecutor continued: The Tito gang and the Kostov espionage group colluded with each other and tried every means to intensify its activities. The Tito faction began its work in accordance with the orders of the Anglo-American intelligence agencies. The Kostov group promised to work to establish a Southern Slav Federation and to cut off the Pirin region of Bulgaria and incorporate it into Yugoslavia.

    The purpose of the federation envisioned by the Tito faction and the Kostov group was to completely destroy the national independence of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and make it completely subordinate to Yugoslavia. At the same time, this federation was to be suddenly declared by means of a coup with the help of Tito's military forces, without the Bulgarian people knowing and against their will. The plan to cut off the Pirin region of Bulgaria and incorporate it into Yugoslavia was also carried out in the same way. Since this federation was to be used to oppose the Soviet Union and help the Anglo-American imperialist camp, the organization of this federation could not but be carried out completely secretly from the Soviet Union.

    The Tito faction was given the right to enter various state organs in Bulgaria at will, and the Yugoslav military attachés were also guaranteed that they could freely obtain all the materials of the Ministry of the Army, even the most secret ones. They were also guaranteed that they could obtain all the secret materials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Kolishevski, Dimitar Vlahov, Saffirovski, Pero Mangovski, Haji Panzov, and all other open or hidden spies of Tito, employees of the Yugoslav Embassy, were guaranteed that they could enter the premises of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party at any time and meet with Kostov. Saffirovski was able to enter the Pirin region completely according to his own will and had the right to carry out anti-Bulgarian and anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda there without interference from anyone. Vlahov and several other lackeys of Tito were also given the same freedom of action.

    Due to the vigilance of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the People's Government, and due to the counterattack of the Macedonians in the Pirin region against the Tito faction and Kostov's supporters, the plan to cut off the Pirin region of Bulgaria and incorporate it into Yugoslavia also failed.

    The evidence obtained in this case irrefutably confirms that the defendants formed a conspiracy illegal organization to achieve their goals. The leadership core of this organization was composed of Kostov, Ivan Stefanov, and Nikola Pavlov. According to their instructions, the other defendants organized some branches, which were directed by this three-person leadership core. Speaking of this, it should be mentioned a testimony from the defendant Pavlov, who said: "...Kostov, Stefanov, and I were to organize a core and concentrate the command of all conspiracy activities in this core."

    Ordered to Place Conspiracy Personnel in Leadership Positions

    According to the defendants' confessions, the personnel of this conspiracy organization were to be placed in leadership positions in party and state organs in accordance with the instructions of British and American agents and Tito's faction. Kostov's occupation of important positions in the party and state administrative organs made this work much easier.

    Kostov admitted that, on his recommendation, Stefan Bogdanov (Kostov knew that he had sworn an oath to the fascist police to be an agent), was immediately appointed to a responsible position in the state security organs after September 9, 1944. Nikola Pavlov was appointed as a member of the Inspection Commission of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and Ivan Maslarov was appointed as the Organizational Minister of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

    Ivan Stefanov was rapidly promoted to a position in the state administrative organs, and he served as the manager of the People's Bank of Bulgaria and the Minister of Finance. Nikola Petkov, Ivan Gevrenov, Ivan Dochev, Boris Kristov, and some other members of this conspiracy organization also occupied important responsible positions.

    Even before September 9, 1944, the fascist police and the British intelligence service told Kostov about the people recruited by the police. After September 9, 1944, Kostov and Nikola Pavlov, because they had the great opportunity to review the documents found in the police organs at that time and identify which party members were employed by the police, they could recruit these people to realize the conspiracy, which was ordered to them by foreign secret service agencies. This is how the conspiracy organization was established.

    This conspiracy organization recruited a large number of people.

    Tito and the Anglo-American intelligence agencies repeatedly issued instructions, stating that it was necessary to take strong action to eliminate anyone who obstructed their actions, and to arrest and assassinate Georgi Dimitrov. Dimitrov had a high prestige in the party and among the people, and was loved by them, so he was a major obstacle to the realization of the conspirators' sinister plans.

    Kostov described in his handwritten confession his meeting with Tito at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav conference in Evksinograd, saying: "Tito expressed in sharp terms his disagreement with the Soviet policy on the Marshall Plan. He pointed out that economically backward countries like Yugoslavia and Bulgaria could not progress without so-called American aid. Tito said: but before providing this aid, the United States proposed that we break with the Soviet Union as a condition.

    Tito emphasized that the American plan stipulated that not only should anti-Soviet forces be increased in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, but also in all other people's democratic countries, various pressures—economic, political, and military—should be put on them in order to make them leave the Soviet Union and join the Western bloc. Traicho Kostov said in his confession that I had warned Tito of Georgi Dimitrov's inevitable resistance to him. In this regard, Tito could not hide his hatred for Dimitrov. Tito shouted furiously: 'How long will this old man hinder me?'"

    Strengthening Sabotage in Various Economic Aspects

    When the defendants learned that although everything indicated that the People's Government was becoming stronger, the Bulgarian Communist Party had won the vast majority of votes in the National Assembly elections, the regime of the Fatherland Front had been further consolidated, especially after the drafting and adoption of the Constitution, after the nationalization of industries, mines, and banks, and because of the labor enthusiasm of the working masses, the defendants decided, in accordance with the advice of the British and American secret service agencies, to strengthen sabotage in all aspects of economic life when their sabotage activities could not produce effective influence.

    The prosecutor continued: When the entire Bulgarian people were infused with labor enthusiasm and realized the Two-Year Plan and later engaged in completing the Five-Year National Economic Plan, the defendants acted against the will and hope of our people and used their high and responsible positions to split and disintegrate our economic life.

    When the Fatherland Front government made tremendous efforts to alleviate the situation of the working people of our country, the defendants did their best to create difficulties and plunge our people into famine. The purpose was to arouse dissatisfaction with the Fatherland Front government led by Georgi Dimitrov, so as to create a psychological basis for a coup and prepare for the coup.

    The prosecutor pointed out: However, the defendants could not undermine the completion of the economic plan and prevent the progress of our country.

    It must be emphasized that the conspirators delayed, obstructed, and attempted to sabotage trade negotiations between our country and other people's democratic countries, especially trade negotiations with the Soviet Union. Traicho Kostov gave this instruction to Boris Kristov when the latter went to Moscow to serve as a commercial counselor. Similar instructions were also given to Ivan Stefanov. When Traicho Kostov and Ivan Stefanov participated in trade negotiations, they adopted similar methods.

    The prosecutor further emphasized that the trial of the defendants was not because of their beliefs or their principles, but because of their specific crimes, which were not only confessed by the defendants themselves but also proven by the materials possessed by the court.

    Comrade Judges: In our country and in Hungary, the Tito elements, who were completely in agreement with the British and American secret service agencies, wanted to eliminate the most outstanding and influential leaders of the labor movement from their path. They intended to kill Comrade Georgi Dimitrov and other comrades.

    Traicho Kostov could only see the Bulgarian people's dependence on their People's Government and their deep sympathy for the Soviet Union. It was precisely for this reason that the conspirators were expecting military intervention from the Tito faction.

    The prosecutor continued: Comrade Judges: You have interrogated the defendants, questioned the witnesses, and listened to the statements of the expert committees. You also have the documents presented in this case. The facts listed in the indictment have been confirmed, and these facts prove that the charges listed in the indictment are correct.

    The Defendants' First Charge is Treason

    The first charge against the defendants is treason. They have established a conspiracy organization. The purpose is to subvert the legally constituted regime of our country through coups, terrorist activities, and socially dangerous crimes. It has been determined that the defendants formed a conspiracy organization. As you have heard from the defendants' confessions, the head of this organization is the so-called three main elements or leadership center that has pleaded guilty. For example, the defendant Stefanov admitted when talking about his conversation with Djilas: "During our meeting, Djilas drew attention to the need to work more earnestly in our country's officer cadres in order to ensure our position in the army. In Djilas' opinion, this would certainly guarantee the convenience if we took action against the government. I quickly informed Kostov of my meeting with Djilas. He replied: 'We already have some of our own people in the military organization.'"

    The defendants accepted the Tito faction's proposal to use the military assistance of the Yugoslav army to achieve the purpose of the conspiracy.

    The defendants' confessions also revealed that they decided to use terrorist methods to assassinate Chairman of the Council of Ministers Georgi Dimitrov and other outstanding leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

    The defendants are also guilty of treason by spreading slanderous rumors of such a nature as to cause distrust of the People's Government and its workers.

    The prosecutor pointed out: The defendants have committed crimes aimed at worsening relations between our country and other countries, especially with the Soviet Union.

    The Tito faction and the British and American secret service agencies demanded strong action from the conspirators. Therefore, Traicho Kostov prohibited the supply of economic information to Soviet representatives. Later, this prohibition proved to be not only a nationalist bias but also a deliberate and planned implementation of a hostile policy.

    The defendant Ivan Stefanov committed the crime of attempting to undermine our country's relations with the Soviet Union and Romania. I agree with the indictment's accusation that the defendants committed espionage. In this regard, the court has abundant materials regarding all the defendants.

    Regarding this point, the prosecutor urged the court to pay attention to the following article of the Bulgarian Constitution: "Betrayal of the motherland is a serious crime against the people and shall be dealt with most severely by law." The prosecutor said: This article also applies to espionage. The defendants have also violated the crime listed in Article 111b of the Criminal Law. The prosecutor stated: Regarding this point, I ask to confirm that the defendants are guilty of treason and espionage, because our law stipulates that "anyone who, in performing a duty related to foreign countries appointed or delegated by the state, intentionally harms the state in the performance of such duty shall be punished."

    The defendants, who are responsible under this article of the Criminal Law, confessed that they had delayed and obstructed trade negotiations with the aim of making the negotiations fail. According to this negotiation, our economy, which is in urgent need of goods and materials, would have been obtained, but the delay of the negotiations caused real damage to our economy, and this delay may have worsened our relations with friendly countries. All of this was done deliberately by the defendants in order to create such an impression among the people: that negotiations with the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union are not smooth, so it is necessary to seek other ways and establish contacts with the imperialist countries.

    As early as November 1944, Traicho Kostov tried to practice his promise to the British intelligence service, that is, to guarantee that he would send his own person to be the trade representative in Moscow.

    This person was Boris Kristov, who had been a lackey of the secret police. On December 2, 1944, Kristov was appointed as the trade representative. On December 18, he received detailed instructions from Kostov regarding his activities in Moscow. In the conversation between Traicho Kostov and Kristov, Kostov said to the latter that he knew that Kristov had been a lackey of the secret police in the past, and he also told Kristov that he had worked for the British intelligence service. He also said that in the future they must continue to work in the same direction.

    The prosecutor recounted Kristov's confession in the court, stating that Kristov's mission in Moscow was to obstruct and alienate Bulgarian-Soviet relations.

    The prosecutor continued that Ivan Stefanov also adopted the same position. When Traicho Kostov replaced the sick Minister of Trade Dimitar Neikov in Moscow, and when Ivan Stefanov participated in the activities of the trade delegation, they both followed the same policy. However, due to the intervention of Comrade Georgi Dimitrov and due to the Soviet state's goodwill towards the Bulgarian people, the defendants' treasonous intentions failed.

    Ivan Dochev, Boris Simov, and others are also guilty of this crime. The defendants, who were charged in the indictment with engaging in sabotage and slack work, committed the crime listed in Article 102, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. This charge has been completely proven. Sabotage and slack work were proposed by the espionage agencies of foreign enemies. Each member of the three-person leadership center—Traicho Kostov, Ivan Stefanov, and Nikola Pavlov—as well as Ivan Gevrenov, Sonu Chonchev, and others, each caused damage and carried out the destructive and subversive activities detailed in the indictment within their own scope.

    The prosecutor pointed out that the sabotage activities have been confirmed by the expert committees. We have heard the speeches of the representatives of these committees, and their judgments have been attached to the case.

    The prosecutor continued, judges, estimate the defendants' criminal activities and consider the circumstances under which they committed the crimes. I believe that there is no room for commutation. On the contrary, I believe that some of them, such as Traicho Kostov, Ivan Stefanov, Nikola Pavlov, Nikola Nachev, and Ivan Gevrenov, committed crimes under such circumstances that aggravated their guilt.

    Article 90 of our Constitution entrusts us to severely punish treason and espionage in accordance with the law.

    When deciding the verdict of the court, you must consider all the materials of this case, but you must also consider our Constitution and Criminal Law.

    There Should Be No Forgiveness for These Criminals

    I ask you not to have any leniency towards the criminals for the following reasons: (1) These people are spies who are very aware of the damage their actions have caused to the country; (2) because these people are in important positions in state administrative organs, and these positions entrust them with a high degree of attention, vigilance, and honesty in serving the people; (3) because the purpose of their activities is to seize all the achievements that the people have gained in the long, arduous, and cruel struggle against royalist fascism, and to once again subject our people to the fascist and capitalist regime; (4) because the purpose of their efforts and crimes is to separate the Bulgarian people from the path they have embarked on since September 9, 1944, and to separate them from the path of strengthening the sincere ties with the Soviet people—the only guarantee of our national independence and state sovereignty; (5) because the problem is not just a one-time action, but a systematic hostile action that has been carried out against our people for many years, and it is a systematic hostile activity aimed at obstructing our people's efforts to build socialism in our country; (6) because when our people began to build their happy future, the criminals did not carry out destructive and subversive work to destroy everything that the people had already established through occasional actions, but through a series of premeditated activities; (7) because they adopted terrorist methods and did not hesitate to physically eliminate Comrade Georgi Dimitrov, who had served our motherland honestly and faithfully throughout his life; (8) Finally, because they decided to use violent methods to achieve their goals and tasks, and even relied on foreign aid, the aid of the Tito army. This situation further aggravates their crimes.

    Judges, you will probably find more reasons to aggravate the defendants' guilt.

    Judges! I am going to start inspecting the specific activities of each defendant in my group of six defendants. The indictment talks about each of them quite fully. Under these circumstances, I can only add a little.

    Kostov is the Central Figure in the Case and Should be Responsible for His Crimes

    1. Traicho Kostov Yunev. This is the central figure in this case, and for this reason, more attention should be paid to him than to his accomplices.

    When the Central Committee of the Party suffered a defeat in 1942 and Traicho Kostov fell into the hands of the police, he surrendered. In his written confession, he justified his surrender by claiming that he had been subjected to so-called material and spiritual pressure, but in fact, he surrendered because he was afraid of being sentenced to death.

    Traicho Kostov hoped to preserve his life by betraying all his comrades and underground organizations. He even wrote a guarantee to act as a police lackey.

    Traicho Kostov admitted in his written confession that Nikola Jeshev, a spy for the British intelligence service, received instructions from the former, stating that the British intelligence service intended to recruit Kostov. Sure enough, in November 1944, Traicho Kostov visited General Oxley, a member of the Allied Control Commission in charge of custody, and met Colonel Byrnes of the British intelligence service in the latter's office. Without much effort, Kostov was offered to serve the British intelligence service.

    During the first meeting between Kostov and Byrnes, the latter outlined the main tasks for Traicho Kostov, and Kostov promised to work in accordance with the directions given.

    Shortly after this meeting, Traicho Kostov met Kadel.

    After his betrayal and signing of the guarantee to become an agent of the secret police, Traicho Kostov worked for the British, American, and Tito's espionage agencies until he was arrested by the State Security Agency.

    Jeshev, an experienced police spy, believed that Traicho Kostov was a person who might hold an important position in the Communist Party in the future, and would therefore be extremely useful. The British espionage agency agreed with this. For this reason, the police and the British espionage agency did not only maintain Kostov's prestige, but also helped him to enhance his prestige. Nikola Jeshev suggested that Kostov befriend Ivan Maslarov, Nikola Pavlov, Stefan Bogdanov, and others, who, like him, had become secret spies of the police and must work to "maintain his prestige." For this purpose, Pavlov was transferred from Skopje to the Pleven prison. A group loyal to Traicho Kostov was formed around him. After he served as the secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party after September 9, 1944, he immediately promoted his group to responsible positions in the party and state administrative organs.

    The British and American secret service agencies used Traicho Kostov's important position in the party. The latter contacted them directly and maintained the most regular contact with Tito's espionage agencies, which were arbitrarily controlled by the British and American intelligence services.

    In order to complete his mission, Kostov established a conspiracy organization headed by him, and brought his friends Nikola Pavlov and Ivan Stefanov into the leadership center. The prosecutor pointed out that because the purpose of the conspiracy organization was to overthrow the legally established Dimitrov government and seize power by force, the conspirators wanted to win over army officers and militiamen to their side and wanted to break into the State Security Agency.

    The British and Tito's espionage agencies suggested to the three-person leadership core that they take resolute action to physically eliminate all those who hindered the conspirators from realizing their plans, especially Dimitrov, because he was the biggest obstacle to the conspirators' sinister plans. The three-person leadership core accepted this suggestion.

    They intended that as soon as they seized power, they would announce the formation of a federation with Yugoslavia, so that Tito could send troops to invade Bulgaria and support the conspiracy with armed forces.

    Kostov's purpose, generally speaking, was to make Bulgaria join Yugoslavia and form an anti-Soviet bloc under the control of imperialist countries.

    This purpose also lay in turning the territories of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria into a bridgehead for the anti-Soviet and anti-people's democratic countries war that the Anglo-American imperialists were now preparing.

    The prosecutor emphasized that all of this, like Kostov's entire criminal activity, was first proven by the confessions of his accomplices, who pleaded guilty in court, confirmed Kostov's crimes, and described his leading role in the criminal conspiracy. The prosecutor mentioned Kostov's confession, believing that it had been proven that Kostov had accepted the tasks of the Anglo-American espionage agencies and the repeated instructions of Tito's espionage agencies to assassinate Georgi Dimitrov, the main obstacle to the conspirators. Kostov confirmed that, in order to achieve this goal, he also used methods such as creating serious riots, which would inevitably aggravate Dimitrov's illness, resulting in his death. The prosecutor cited some evidence, confessions of defendants and witnesses to confirm Kostov's criminal contacts with the Anglo-American espionage agencies and the Tito group. The prosecutor pointed out that Kostov had handed over information about state secrets to the Anglo-American agencies, which was admitted by Kostov in his handwritten confession and had been confirmed. In this regard, Kristov's confession is particularly valuable. During the six days of the trial, the evidence collected through thorough and comprehensive investigation should be considered to have completely confirmed that the defendant Kostov was a lackey and informer of the police in the Bulgarian Communist Party since 1942, and then contacted the British intelligence service through Colonel Byrnes, the head of the British Balkan espionage agency, and served them.

    It should be considered that it has been determined that the defendant Kostov, with the consent and approval of the Anglo-American reactionaries, established criminal contacts with Tito and his confidants, wanting to deprive the People's Republic of Bulgaria of its national independence and state sovereignty with the military assistance agreed to be given by the Tito government, and incorporate it into Yugoslavia. Kostov's criminal contacts with the Tito fascist ruling group to arrest and assassinate Dimitrov have also been confirmed. This is the main and irrefutable evidence presented to you, citizens and judges, about the indictment against Kostov.

    Kostov's criminal activities have been proven in the spirit of the indictment. As indicated in the indictment, Kostov should be held responsible for it.

    Other Defendants Should Also Be Responsible for Their Crimes

    2. Ivan Stefanov Haji-Mateev. The prosecutor pointed out that after September 9, 1944, Ivan Stefanov became close to Traicho Kostov. Kostov, Nikola Pavlov, and Stefanov formed the "three-person leadership core"—the underground center of the treasonous conspiracy.

    As a member of the "three-person leadership core", he personally recruited Georgi Petrov to participate in the conspiracy organization, and on his recommendation, the latter was appointed as the administrative secretary of the Ministry of Finance. With Petrov's help, Stefanov directed sabotage work in the Ministry of Finance.

    He appointed Sonu Chonchev as the manager of the People's Bank of Bulgaria and used him to carry out sabotage activities in the financial aspect. Stefanov promoted Ivan Gevrenov to the director of the rubber industry department, conducting sabotage in various factories in this industry.

    The prosecutor detailed Ivan Stefanov's criminal activities, citing materials from the expert committee and other materials.

    The prosecutor said that after the defendant Stefanov confessed and after reviewing the submitted documents, it should be considered that Stefanov's charges are completely established and that he should be convicted.

    3. Nikola Pavlov Kolev. The prosecutor continued, in 1942, in the police organs, without any physical or spiritual coercion, Pavlov submitted a written pledge to Jeshev, guaranteeing that he would act as a police lackey. The prosecutor pointed out that when he was transferred to the Pleven prison after being sentenced to imprisonment, Nikola Pavlov established contact with Traicho Kostov in that place. According to Nikola Pavlov's confession, they made plans for hostile activities in prison. Shortly after September 9, 1944, Traicho Kostov, who was the secretary of the Party Central Committee, summoned Pavlov and placed him to work in the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Nikola Pavlov was one of Traicho Kostov's most trusted lackeys.

    As a member of the conspiracy guidance center, Nikola Pavlov, together with Ivan Stefanov and Traicho Kostov, bears responsibility for all the crimes he personally committed and all the crimes committed by other members of the conspiracy organization.

    Nikola Pavlov confessed in the preliminary investigation to the criminal activities he was still engaged in until his arrest. This activity has also been confirmed by other defendants.

    Nikola Pavlov Kolev is guilty of all the charges listed in the indictment.

    4. Nikola Nachev Petkov. In explaining the characteristics of Nikola Nachev's criminal activities, the prosecutor pointed out that Nachev had been serving the British intelligence service since 1941 and was an agent of the Bulgarian fascist police. He maintained close relations with Kiril Slavov, who also maintained contacts with the British intelligence service.

    Nikola Nachev arranged for the contact between Traicho Kostov and Kiril Slavov, and at the same time supplied information to the British intelligence service through Kiril Slavov.

    After thoroughly examining Nachev, Traicho Kostov invited him to join the conspiracy organization. Nachev agreed. The prosecutor said that Kostov explained to Nachev that he should recruit people, specifically selecting from among those who maintain contacts with Western countries. Nachev recruited Dimitar, Kochimmidov, and Boris Kristov.

    The prosecutor said: The defendant has personally told you that he has engaged in slack work and sabotage, and has cited several specific examples of sabotage.

    The prosecutor believes that the crimes committed by the defendant Nikola Nachev have been determined, and therefore he must be convicted according to the indictment.

    5. Boris Andonov Kristov. The prosecutor stated: The defendant has pleaded guilty to the charges in the indictment. He admitted (recorded on page 273 of the trial record) as

　　保加利亚叛国案起诉人总结发言
    【塔斯社索非亚十四日电】在十二月十二日审讯特拉伊科·科斯托夫及其同谋犯时，起诉人向法院提出若干关于被告犯罪的文件。在被告律师也提出了有关的文件之后，首席推事鲍里斯·洛查诺夫宣称：
    “由于考虑到起诉人及被告律师所提出的文件对于本案的正确判决可能是重要的原因，法院认为把这些文件记载于本案所要通过的判决中是可能的。这样，法庭的调查就被认为是完备的了。”
    首席推事继乃请首席起诉人乌拉第果尔·第姆切夫发言。起诉人说：
    同志们！法院对于特拉伊科·科斯托夫及其同谋犯的叛国案的调查业已完全明白地证明，我们所对付的这个阴谋之目的，在于以武力推翻在我国依法建立起来的国家政权，破坏民族独立和国家主权。
    　　　　阴谋侵害保国领土并从肉体上消灭保国人民领袖季米特洛夫
    我们对付的这个阴谋所追求之目的，在于割裂保加利亚共和国领土的一部分，把它奉送给别的国家，从而侵害保加利亚共和国的领土完整。这个阴谋的目的也在于肉体上消灭保加利亚人民共和国总理、我国人民的领袖和导师格奥尔基·季米特洛夫同志。
    业已确定：这一阴谋的罪魁及其煽动者是英美的走狗，而且这些谋叛者曾期望于铁托南斯拉夫的军事干涉。
    这个阴谋是英美帝国主义集团对我国的人民民主政权和民族独立与国家主权所奉行的阴谋与敌对政策之一环。
    而且，从国际的观点看来，反对保加利亚的这个阴谋是英美帝国主义者反对东南欧人民民主国家的阴谋的一部分。英美帝国主义者正在利用叛徒铁托及其间谍伙伴作为实现这一阴谋计划的主要工具。
    英美帝国主义者对东南欧的这种侵略性政策始于第二次世界大战的时候邱吉尔的开辟第二战场的计划，不是在西方而是在巴尔干，其目的不是别的，而是在于以从希特勒占领军的统治下解放巴尔干各国为借口，来占领巴尔干各国。然而，如所周知，这个计划并未实现，或者更正确地说，后来只是部分地实现了，只是在希腊实现了，希腊直到今天仍然为英美军队所占领，且实际上已经丧失了她的民族独立。
    英美军队曾准备占领南斯拉夫以及保加利亚与东南欧和中欧的其他国家，但是，由于英勇苏军的光荣的胜利，他们的计划破产了；苏军从德国占领军的魔爪下解放了这些国家，并从而使这些国家的人民能够在本国建立一个真正民主的政权和走上社会主义建设的道路。
    英美帝国主义者不甘心于巴尔干与多瑙河盆地的这一情况，即人民民主国家摆脱了对帝国主义的依赖性。人民民主国家政治上与经济上的独立是帝国主义者的眼中钉。他们愿意看到这些国家处在和现在保皇法西斯希腊一样的地位，即是说，他们梦想变这些国家为他们的殖民地，并破坏他们的民族独立。
    西方帝国主义者特别是美英帝国主义者是不能够眼巴巴地看着我国在一九四四年九月赢得胜利之后，如何在建设一个新民主共和国；在苏联及其他人民民主国家的帮助下这个新民主共和国正日益发展壮大，且在政治、经济与文化各方面都在发展。帝国主义者不甘心于在第二次世界大战后失去他们对许多国家的劫掠性的控制，这些国家归于伟大的苏军——解放者把她们从希特勒侵略者的桎梏下解放出来。帝国主义者也不能眼巴巴地看着这些国家由于苏联大公无私的帮助，正在迅速地向社会主义迈进。帝国主义者尽一切可能阻挠保加利亚人民及其他人民民主国家的人民和平地、胜利地沿着民主与社会主义的道路发展。
    这正是英美帝国主义者对我国及其他人民民主国家奉行颠覆性的阴谋政策之出发点，这正是所谓“暗地侵略”与“内部侵略”政策的出发点。
    英美的走卒试图从这些国家的法西斯和反动集团当中，从人民民主政权的敌人当中为他们的“内部侵略”招雇力量。阴谋者的罪恶企图在于以卑鄙的政变，在各人民民主国家恢复旧有的反动的保皇法西斯政权，这是大家都知道的。罗马尼亚的马尼乌和米哈拉克谋叛的犯罪伙帮，匈牙利的费伦克·奈基一伙、波兰的米科拉兹柯、捷克斯洛伐克一九四八年二月发生的。军事法西斯阴谋等，都是抱着这种企图的。在我们的国家中，若干军事法西斯组织，诸如“克鲁王”、“中立军官”及其他等，都怀有这种阴谋。这也是那些谋叛者——人所共知的英美间谍盖托、尼古拉、彼特科夫、科斯达·鲁尔切夫及其他等人所怀抱的罪恶图谋。
    在我国和其他人民民主国家中，这一切阴谋是在英美谍报机关指使与帮助下组织的。我们有丰富的事实足以令人信服地证明各人民民主国家中的阴谋和反政府活动的许多线索，都是直接引向美国、英国及南斯拉夫驻在这些国家中的使馆的。在这次审讯中，许多这种事实也被提到了。在这方面必须强调指出：甚至在今日，美英驻保加利亚的使馆人员过分地多，而与这些使馆在我们国家中所办公务的微不足道，是绝不相称的。我们的公众有权发问：严格说来，这许多人在上述的使馆中干些什么事呢？当美英特务机关组织与唆使反动派和法西斯力量反对保加利亚人民共和国的企图宣告失败后，他们便开始把他的希望寄托在以特拉伊科·科斯托夫为首的一群谋叛者的身上，这些谋叛者长时间以来就一直执行交托给他们的间谍任务。在他们针对我们国家的阴谋计划中，英美帝国主义国者利用叛逆的铁托间谍伙帮作为他们的主要武器。
    我们从这次审讯的材料中看到：卡德尔、德热拉斯、铁托及兰科维奇经常要求阴谋者集团领导中心的特拉伊科·科斯托夫迅速和坚决地行动起来。
    为了使我们明确了解铁托伙帮在反对我们的国家的阴谋中所起的作用，那首先需要确切说明它与英美帝国主义者的关系。我们知道：这种关系已在布达佩斯的拉伊克和布兰科夫的审讯中很好地确定下来了。
    早在战争期间，铁托伙帮就转向英美了。铁托伙帮以欺骗的手段获得了共产党领导地位，随后又攫取了南斯拉夫的政权。这样，南斯拉夫人民和南斯拉夫国家的独立便由铁托分子出卖给英美帝国主义者了。
    在这方面经验最多的英国情报处，首先在铁托分子间开始工作，不久则为美国特务机关继起追上。英国情报处正确地看出铁托是一个可以依靠的顽梗不化的托洛斯基分子。英国情报处深信：铁托同托洛斯基分子兰科维奇、德热拉斯、卡德尔和其他等人一道，会在南斯拉夫及其他巴尔干和多瑙河流域国家中执行英美的帝国主义侵略政策。铁托伙帮充分证明了这种希望是有根据的，他们扮演了英美帝国主义者走卒的卑鄙角色。
    但英美帝国主义者的罪恶计划并不仅限于针对南斯拉夫一国。铁托分子们获得了任务，也要在其他人民民主国家内进行颠覆工作，并试图在这些国家中建立他们自己的代理机构。
    为了达到这个目的，铁托分子在保加利亚展开了广泛的活动。他们的任务已由英美走卒加以明确的规定。他们必须钻进保加利亚共产党的内部。在这方面，特拉伊科·科斯托夫及其同谋者成为他们的适宜的盟友。
    特拉伊科·科斯托夫很久以前就获得英国情报处的信任了。事实上英国情报处曾劝说尼科拉·杰什夫招雇特拉伊科·科斯托夫为法西斯警察的代理人。
    充当美英铁托走狗成立谋叛组织
    在一九四四年九月九日之后不久，特拉伊科·科斯托夫即曾与英国情报处的拜当上校会晤。在初次的会晤后，特拉伊科·科斯托夫就毫不犹豫地变成了英国情报处的走狗了。特拉伊科·科斯托夫及其同谋与美英谍报机关的代表们之间、是融洽一致的。特拉伊科·科斯托夫及其同谋们热心地执行美英特务机关的训令。为了实现他们所接受的确定任务，特拉伊科·科斯托夫及其同谋者组织了非法的谋叛组织及其分支机构。所有的被告们开始作为铁托的走狗，换句话说，作为英美特务机关的走狗而从事危害我们国家民族独立的工作，开始为使保加利亚脱离苏联而工作，尽管事实上他们都了解到并且深切地知道保加利亚人民在一九四四年九月九日之所以能够获得胜利，完全由于苏联军队的决定性援助；尽管我们人民民主国家的成立与巩固是由于苏联过去给与而现在仍然给与的巨大、慷慨、大公无私的帮助；尽管我国的经济、文化及政治的进步是由于我们与苏联的友好关系和合作；尽管我们独立和我们国家主权的维持之所以证明为可能而且成为可能，是完全由于苏联所给予我们的保护。
    所有的被告们都完全认识到由于他们的叛逆的间谍行为和颠覆活动，他们使我们的人民和我们的国家所受到的害处，以及他们使和平与民主事业所受到的害处。
    今天每一个爱国者、每一个正直的保加利亚公民都知道：我们国家与苏联的友谊和合作是我们民族独立、我们国家主权、我们文化经济之和平发展的保证。苏联不仅是我们国家而且也是所有人民民主国家循着进步与社会主义大道向前发展的保证。苏联是全世界一切被奴役被压迫国家获得解放的希望和鼓舞，被告很明了这一点，但是尽管如此，他们仍然想使我国与苏联相隔离，想建立反对苏联人民的敌对集团。
    起诉人继称：铁托伙帮与科斯托夫间谍集团互相勾搭，千方百计地企图加紧它的活动。铁托党羽遵照英美特务机关的命令开始了他们的工作。科斯托夫集团答应了为建立南方斯拉夫人联邦和割去保加利亚的彼林区使之并入南斯拉夫而进行工作。
    铁托党羽和科斯托夫集团所设想的联邦，其目的是将保加利亚人民共和国的民族独立摧残得一干二净，使它完全成为南斯拉夫的附属物。同时，这个联邦要不让保加利亚人民知道且违背他们的意志，在铁托的军事力量的帮助下以政变的办法来突然宣告成立。割去保加利亚的彼林区而并入南斯拉夫也用这同样的一套办法。由于这个联邦是要用来反对苏联和帮助英美帝国主义阵营的，所以组织这个联邦不能不完全是瞒着苏联来进行。
    铁托党羽得到任意进入保加利亚各个国家机关的权利，南斯拉夫的武官还得到保证，他们可以任意得悉陆军部的一切材料，即使最秘密的也一样。他们也得到保证可以得悉内政部的一切秘密材料。科利雪夫斯基，季米特尔·伏拉霍夫（前译为伏拉克索夫），南斯拉夫公使馆的职员萨菲罗夫斯基、彼罗·曼哥夫斯基、哈德伊·潘佐夫和其他一切铁托的公开或暗藏的间谍，都得到保证，可以随时任意进入保共中央委员会的房舍和科斯托夫会面。萨菲罗夫斯基可以完全听随自己的意思进入彼林区，并且有权利不受到任何人的干涉在那里进行反保加利亚，反苏的煽动和宣传。伏拉霍夫和其他若干铁托的走狗也都得到同样的行动自由。
    由于保加利亚共产党和人民政府的警惕，由于彼林区马其顿人对铁托党羽和科斯托夫支持者的反击，想割去保加利亚彼林区而并入南斯拉夫的计划也同样归于失败。
    本案所获的据证无可置辩地证实了被告为了达到他们的目的成立了一＋个阴谋的非法组织，这个组织的领导核心由科斯托夫、伊凡·斯捷法诺夫、尼可拉·巴夫洛夫组成。根据他们的训令，其他的被告又组织了一些分支，由这三人领导核心指挥。说到这里，应当提一提被告巴夫洛夫的一段供词，他说：“……科斯托夫、斯捷法诺夫和我要组织一个核心，把一切谋叛活动的指挥权都集中在这个核心手里。”
    受令安插谋叛人员到领导职位上去
    据被告供认：按照英国和美国特务和铁托党羽的训令，这个谋叛组织的人员要安插到党和国家机关的领导职位上去。科斯托夫在党与国家行政机构中盘踞要津，使得作这件工作大为方便。
    科斯托夫承认：在他的推荐之下，斯提芬·波格达诺夫（科斯托夫是知道他曾向法西斯警察具结作特务的），在一九四四年九月九日后立刻就被任命到国家保安机关担任负责任的工作。尼可拉·巴夫洛夫被任命为保共中央监察委员会的委员，伊凡·马斯拉罗夫被任命为保共中央委员会的组织部长。
    伊凡·斯捷法诺夫被迅速提拔到国家行政机关中任职，他担任了保加利亚人民银行的经理和财政部长。尼可拉·彼特科夫、伊凡·杰夫列诺夫、伊凡·杜捷夫、鲍里斯·克里斯托夫和这个谋叛组织的其他一些人员也盘踞着重要的负责职务。
    甚至还在一九四四年九月九日以前，法西斯警察和英国情报处就把警察所招罗的人物告诉了科斯托夫。一九四四年九月九日以后，科斯托夫和尼可拉·巴夫洛夫，因为那时候查看在警察机关中发现的文件而得到查明那一些党员是被警察雇用的大好机会，这样他们就可以网罗这些人来实现阴谋，这是外国特务机关命令他们作的。谋叛机构建立的情形就是这样。
    这个谋叛组织网罗了大批的人。
    铁托以及英美谍报机关接连不断地来训令，说明有必要采取有力行动，消灭任何一个阻挠他们的行动的人，并逮捕和暗杀格奥尔基·季米特洛夫。季米特洛夫在党和人民群众中有很高的威望，受到他们的热爱，因此是实现谋叛者的罪恶计划的大障碍。
    科斯托夫在他亲笔的供词中形容他和铁托在埃夫克西诺格勒的保南会议时会面的情形，他说：“铁托以尖锐的辞句表示他不同意苏联对马歇尔计划的政策。他指出象南斯拉夫和保加利亚这样经济落后的国家，是所谓没有美国援助就不能进步的。铁托称：但在提供这种援助以前，美国提出我们和苏联破裂作为条件。
    铁托着重指出美国的计划规定不仅要在南斯拉夫和保加利亚增加反苏力量，并且也在所有其他的人民民主国家中增加反苏联力量，对他们加以各种压力——从经济上、政治上和军事上——以便使他们离开苏联并使他们参加西方集团。特拉伊科·科斯托夫在其自白中称，我曾以格奥尔基·季米特洛夫对他不可避免的抵抗警告铁托。在这一方面，铁托不能掩藏他对季米特洛夫的憎恨。铁托狂怒的叫喊道：‘这个老头子还要阻挡我多久？’”
    加强在经济各方面的破坏
    当被告获悉：虽然每件事情表示人民政府的更加强大，保加利亚共产党在国民议会选举时得到了绝大多数的选票，祖国阵线的政权特别是在起草和通过宪法后，在工业、矿山和银行国有化之后已经进一步巩固以及由于劳动群众的劳动热情，被告的破坏活动不能产生有效的影响的时候，被告却按照英国和美国特务机关的劝告，决定加强在经济生活各方面的破坏。
    起诉人继称：当全保加利亚人民灌注着劳动热情而实现了两年计划及以后从事完成五年国民经济计划的时候，被告却违反我国人民的意愿与希望而行事，利用其高而负责的职位分裂和瓦解我们的经济生活。
    当祖国阵线政府竭尽巨大的努力以缓和我国劳动人民的境遇时，被告却尽其所能的来制造困难和使我国人民陷于饥馑。其目的系在激起对格奥尔基·季米特洛夫所领导的祖国阵线政府的不满，以便这样来为政变制造心理基础，进而准备政变。
    起诉人指出：然而，被告等不能破坏经济计划的完成及阻止我国的进步。
    必须着重指出：阴谋者延缓，阻碍并企图破坏我国与其他人民民主国家的贸易谈判，特别是与苏联的贸易谈判。特拉伊科·科斯托夫在鲍里斯·克里斯托夫赴莫斯科任商务参赞时曾给予后者以此种训令。此种训令并曾给予伊凡·斯捷法诺夫，当特拉伊科·科斯托夫和伊凡·斯捷法诺夫参加贸易谈判时，他们采用了类似的方法。
    起诉人进一步着重指出：对被告等的审讯不是因为他们的信仰，不是因为他们的原则，而是因为他们的具体罪行，这种罪行不仅被告自行供认并且也由法庭所拥有的材料所证明。
    推事同志：在我国和在匈牙利，与英国和美国特务机关完全一致的铁托分子，想从他们的路上清除最卓越和有影响的劳工运动领袖。他们意欲杀害格奥尔基·季米特洛夫同志和其他的同志。
    特拉伊科·科斯托夫只能看到保加利亚人民对其人民政府的依慕及其对苏联的深深的同情。正是因为这个理由，阴谋者就期望着铁托分子的军事干涉。
    起诉人继称：推事同志：你们已经审问过被告，讯问过证人，听取了专家委员会的声明。你们手头并有在这一案件中提出的文件。起诉书中所列举的各项事实都已得到证实，这些事实证明起诉书所列举的罪状是正确的。
    被告等第一项罪名是叛国罪
    被告等的第一项罪名是叛国罪。他们已建立谋叛的组织。其目的为通过政变、通过恐怖活动和危及社会的罪行，颠覆我国的合法组成的政权。业经确定：被告等组成了谋叛组织。如你们曾由被告供词中听取的，这个组织的首脑是业经服罪的所谓三个首要分子或领导中心。例如：被告斯捷法诺夫在讲到他与德热拉斯的谈话时，便曾承认过：“在我们会谈时，德热拉斯促起注意需要在我国的军官干部中更认真地进行工作，以便确保我们在军队中的地位。就德热拉斯的意见，这必定会保证如遇我们对政府采取行动时的便利。我很快地把我与德热拉斯的会谈告知科斯托夫。他回答道：‘我们业已有一些自己人在军事组织中。’
    被告等接受了铁托分子的利用南斯拉夫军队的军事援助以达到阴谋目的的提议。
    被告等的供词并透露他们决定凭借恐怖方法，以谋杀部长会议主席格奥尔吉·季米特洛夫和保加利亚共产党的其他杰出的领袖。
    被告等并因散布可能引起对人民政府及其工作者不信任的这种性质的诽谤斓言而犯有叛国罪。
    起诉人指出：被告等曾犯旨在恶化我国与其他国家并且首先是与苏联的关系的罪行。
    铁托分子、英国和美国特务机关曾要求阴谋者大力的行动。因此，特拉伊科·科斯托夫禁止供给苏联代表一种经济性质的情报。后来，这种禁令表明不仅是一种民族主义的偏向，而且是有意的、有计划的实行一种敌对政策。
    被告伊凡·斯捷法诺夫犯了企图破坏我国对苏联和罗马尼亚之关系的罪行。我同意起诉书中对被告犯了间谍罪的控诉。在这一方面法庭持有关于所有被告的丰富材料。
    关于这一点，起诉人促请法庭注意保加利亚宪法的下述条文：“背叛祖国是反人民的重大罪行，应以法律的最严厉处置。”起诉人称：这一条文也适用于间谍罪。各犯并触犯刑法第一一一条乙项的罪行。起诉人声称：关于这一点，我要求确认各被告犯了叛逆罪和间谍罪，因为我国法律规定“凡在执行国家所任命或委派的有关外国的职责时，故意使这种职责之奉行危害国家的人，应受处罚。”
    按照刑法的这一条而应负责任的被告供称，他们曾怀着使谈判失败的目的，拖延与阻挠贸易谈判。根据这次谈判，是会得到我国经济所急需的货物和材料的，然而，谈判的拖延使我国经济遭受了真正的损害，这种拖延还可能使我们和友邦的关系趋于恶化。所有这一切都是被告故意这样做的，以便在人民群众当中造成这么个印象：即和人民民主国家与苏联进行谈判并不是顺利的，因此，必须另谋他途，和帝国主义国家建立联系。
    早在一九四四年十一月，特拉伊科·科斯托夫曾试图实践他对英国情报处的诺言，即是保证派他自己的人做驻莫斯科的贸易代表。
    这个人就是曾经做过秘密警察走狗的鲍里斯·克里斯托夫。一九四四年十二月二日克里斯托夫被任命为贸易代表。十二月十八日他接受了科斯托夫对于他在莫斯科活动的详细训令。在特拉伊科·科斯托夫和克里斯托夫的谈话中，科斯托夫曾对后者说，他知道克里斯托夫过去曾是秘书警察的走狗，而且他又告诉克里斯托夫说，他曾为英国情报处工作过。他还说，将来他们一定在同样的方向来继续工作。
    起诉人追述克里斯托夫在法院中的供词称，克里斯托夫在莫斯科的任务乃是阻挠保苏关系，并离间保苏关系。
    起诉人继称，伊凡·斯捷法诺夫也采取同样的立场。当特拉伊科·科斯托夫在莫斯科代替了生病的贸易部长季米特尔·奈科夫，当伊凡·斯捷法诺夫参加贸易代表团的活动的时候，他们两人都遵循着同样的方针。然而，由于格奥尔基·季米特洛夫同志的干涉，由于苏维埃国家对保加利亚人民的善意，被告们的叛逆意图便失败了。
    伊凡·吐捷夫、鲍里斯·西莫夫及其他等人也犯有这种罪。起诉书所提出的被告因从事破坏与怠工活动，犯刑法第一百零二条第一项所论列之罪。这一罪状已完全被证明了。破坏活动和怠工是外国敌人的谍报机关所提议的。三人领导中心的每一个成员——特拉伊科·科斯托夫、伊凡·斯捷法诺夫和尼可拉·巴夫洛夫以及伊凡·杰夫列诺夫、索努·钟切夫及其他等人，每人都在他自己的范围之内造成损害，进行起诉书中所详细举出的破坏和颠覆性活动。
    起诉人指出，破坏活动已由专家委员会所确证了，我们听过这些委员会的代表的发言，而且他们的判定已附在案件上。
    起诉人继称，法官同志们估计了被告的犯罪活动，考虑了他们犯罪的环境，我认为，无论如何是没有减刑的余地的。相反地，我认为，其中某些人如特拉伊科·科斯托夫、伊凡·斯捷法诺夫、尼可拉·巴夫洛夫、尼可拉·纳切夫、伊凡·杰夫列诺夫都是在使他们的罪加重的这种情况下犯罪的。
    我国宪法第九十条责成我们依法严惩叛国及间谍罪。
    在决定法庭的判决时，你们必须考虑到本案的一切材料，但是你们也必须考虑到我国的宪法和刑法。
    对这些罪犯不应有任何宽恕
    我要求你们为了下列理由不要对罪犯怀有任何宽大：（１）这些人是很了解他们行为对国家所造成的损害的间谍分子；（２）因为这些人是在国家行政机关盘踞重要职位的人，而这些职位责成他们在为人民服务时应有高度的注意、警觉和诚实；（３）因为他们活动的目的，在于夺取人民在反对保皇法西斯的长期艰苦与残酷的斗争中所得的一切成果，再度使我国人民为法西斯和资本家政权所征服；（４）因为他们的努力和罪行的目的，是在使保加利亚人民脱离他们在一九四四年九月九日以后所踏上的道路，脱离加强与我们民族独立和国家主权的唯一保证——苏联人民——的真诚联系的道路；（５）因为问题为不只是一次的行动，而是多年来一直对我国人民所进行的有系统的敌对行动，是旨在阻挠我国人民在我国建设社会主义之努力的有系统的敌对活动；（６）因为当我国人民开始建设其幸福的未来的时候，罪犯们不是通过偶尔的行动，而是通过一连串预谋的活动，来进行以破坏人民所已经建立的一切的破坏颠覆性工作；（７）因为他们采取恐怖行动的方法，甚至在意图肉体消灭毕生对我们祖国作诚实与忠心服务的格奥尔基·季米特洛夫同志时，他们丝毫都没有迟疑过。（８）最后，因为他们决定使用暴力的方法来达到其目的和任务，并且甚至凭借外国的援助、铁托军队的援助。这种情况更加重了他们的罪。
    法官同志们，你们还将可能发见更多的加重被告罪行的理由。
    法官同志们！我将要开始检察我的由六名被告组织的小组中每一个被告的具体活动。起诉书很充分地谈到他们每一个人。在这种情况下，我只能略加补充。
    科斯托夫是本案中心人物应对其罪行负责
    一、特拉伊科·科斯托夫·尤涅夫。这是本案的中心人物，并且因为这一理由，理应对于他较之对于他的同谋付以更大的注意。
    当一九四二年党的中央委员会由于遭受失败而特拉伊科·科斯托夫沦入警察机关之手时，他投降了。在他所写的供词中，他辩解自己的投降是由于所谓曾受到物质上和精神上的压力，但实际上却是由于害怕被判处死刑而投降的。
    特拉伊科·科斯托夫希望以背叛他所有的同志和地下组织来保全他的生命。他甚至写了充当警察走狗的保证书。
    特拉伊科·科斯托夫在他所写的供词中供认：英国情报处的间谍尼科拉·杰什夫接到前者的训令，表示英国情报处有意招雇科斯托夫。果然，一九四四年十一月，特拉伊科·科斯托夫访问了盟国驻保管制委员会委员奥克斯莱将军，并在后者的办公室中会到英国情报处的拜雷上校，没有多费周折就提议科斯托夫为英国情报处服务。
    在科斯托夫与拜雷的首次会晤时，后者给特拉伊科·斯托夫规划了主要任务，科斯托夫答应按照所指示的方针去工作。
    在这次会晤后不久，特拉伊科·科斯托夫会到了卡德尔。
    在他背叛及签署成为秘密警察的代理人的保证后，特拉伊科·科斯托夫为英国、美国和铁托的间谍机关工作，直到他被国家保安机关逮捕时为止。
    富于经验的警察间谍什夫认为特拉伊科·科斯托夫是一个将来可能在共产党中取得重要位置，并且因而会极端有用的人。英国间谍机关同意了这一点。因为这种理由，警察和英国间谍机关的确不仅维持科斯托夫的威信，并且帮助他去提高威信。尼科拉·杰什夫建议科斯托夫与伊凡·马斯拉罗夫、尼可拉·巴夫洛夫、斯提芬·波格达诺夫等人结交，这些人象他一样已成为警察的秘密间谍并必须为“保持他的威信”而工作。为了此一目的，巴夫洛夫被从斯科普里转移到普列文监获。在特拉伊科·科斯托夫周围组成了一个忠实于他的集团。他在一九四四年九月九日以后担任保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记后，立即把他的集团提拔到党和国家行政机关的负责职位。
    英国和美国特务关机利用了特拉伊科·科斯托夫在党内的重要地位。后者与他们直接联系并与铁托的特务机关保持最正规的联系，而铁托的特务机关是为英国和美国情报处所任意支配的。
    科斯托夫为完成他的任务，建立了以他为首的谋叛组织，并且把他的朋友尼可拉·巴夫洛夫和伊凡·斯捷法诺夫拖入领导中心去。起诉人指出，因为谋叛组织的目的在于推翻依法成立的季米特洛夫政府并用武力夺取政权，所以谋叛者便想争取陆军军官、民团到他们那边去，想打进国家保安机关去。
    英国和铁托的谍报机关向三人领导核心提出建议，要他们坚决行动，从肉体上消灭一切妨碍阴谋者实现其计划的人，特别是季米特洛夫，因为他是谋叛者的罪恶计划的最大障碍。三人领导核心接受了这个建议。
    他们打算一夺得政权，就宣布与南斯拉夫组成联邦，使铁托可以派军侵入保加利亚，以武装力量支持这个阴谋。
    科斯托夫的目的总的说来就是使保加利亚加入南斯拉夫，构成帝国主义国家手下的一个反苏集团。
    这个目的还在于把南斯拉夫和保加利亚的领土变成英美帝国主义者现在准备中的反苏、反人民民主国家的战争的桥头堡垒。
    起诉人强调，所有这一切，和科斯托夫整个罪恶活动一样首先为其同谋犯的供词所证明，他们在法庭上服了罪，证实科斯托夫的罪行，并且叙述了他在罪恶阴谋中的领导作用。起诉人提到科斯托夫的供词，认为已经证明，科斯托夫接受了英美谍报机关的任务和铁托特务机关的接二连三的训令，要暗杀阴谋者的主要障碍格奥尔基·季米特洛夫。科斯托夫证实，为了达此目的，他还用了诸如造成严重骚乱的办法，这种事情必不可避免地会加剧季米特洛夫的病况，致他于死命。起诉人至此援引了一些证据、被告和证人的供词，来证实科斯托夫与英美谍报机关及铁托集团的犯罪联系。起诉人指出，科斯托夫曾把有关国家机密的情报交给英美南特务机关，这是科斯托夫在其亲笔所写的供词中承认了的，这一点也已得到确证。在这方面，特别有价值的是克里斯托夫的供词。在六天的审讯过程中，经彻底和全面地调查汇集起来的证据，应该认为已完全确证被告科斯托夫自一九四二年起即为警察在保加利亚共产党内的走狗、奸细，其后又通过英国巴尔干谍报机关首脑拜雷上校与英国情报处接上关系，为他们服务。
    应该认为已经确定的是，被告科斯托夫得到英美反动派的同意和批准，与铁托及其亲信建立了犯罪联系，想凭借铁托政府约定给予的军事援助，来剥夺保加利亚人民共和国的民族独立和国家主权，使之并入南斯拉夫。科斯托夫与铁托法西斯统治集团为逮捕与暗害季米特洛夫而建立的犯罪联系也已得到了确证。这就是对科斯托夫的检举所提给你们、公民和法官们的主要的无可辩驳的证明。
    科斯托夫的犯罪活动，已根据起诉书的精神予以证明，象控诉书所指明的，科斯托夫应负其责。
    其他各犯亦应对其罪行负责
    二、伊凡·斯捷法诺夫·哈德伊——马捷也夫。起诉人指出，在一九四四年九月九日以后，伊凡·斯捷法诺夫就和特拉伊科·科斯托夫接近起来了。科斯托夫，尼可拉·巴夫洛夫与斯捷法诺夫组成“三人领导核心”——叛国阴谋的地下中心。
    作为“三人领导核心”之一员，他亲自吸收乔吉·彼特罗夫参加阴谋组织，且在他的推荐下，后者被任命为财政部行政秘书。在彼特罗夫的帮助下，斯捷法诺夫在财政部中指导破坏工作。
    他委任索努·钟切夫为保加利亚人民银行经理，并利用他在财政方面进行破坏活动。斯捷法诺夫提升伊凡·杰夫列诺夫为橡胶工业司司长，在这一工业的各工厂中进行破坏。
    起诉人详述伊凡·斯捷法诺夫的犯罪活动，引证专家委员会的材料及其他材料。
    起诉人说，在被告斯捷法诺夫供认不讳后，在审查过提出的文件后，应认为斯捷法诺夫的罪状是完全成立的，并应对他判罪。
    三、尼可拉·巴夫洛夫·科列夫。起诉人继续说，一九四二年，在警察机关中，在没有任何身体上与精神上的胁迫的情况下，巴夫洛夫向杰什夫提出书面誓约，保证他充当警察的走狗。起诉人指出，在判他有期徒刑后把他转到普列文监狱时，尼可拉·巴夫洛夫在该地与特拉伊科·科斯托夫建立了联系。根据尼可拉·巴夫洛夫的供词，他们在监狱中订出了进行敌对活动的计划。一九四四年九月九日之后不久，身为党中央委员会书记的特拉伊科·科斯托夫召见巴夫洛夫，并安置他在保加利亚共产党中央委员会中工作。尼可拉·巴夫洛夫是特拉伊科·科斯托夫的最亲信的走狗之一。
    作为阴谋指导中心的一个成员，尼可拉·巴夫洛夫和伊凡·斯捷法诺夫及特拉伊科·科斯托夫一同担负他个人所犯的一切罪行以及阴谋组织的其他成员所犯的一切罪行的责任。
    尼可拉·巴夫洛夫在初步调查中，对他直到被捕以前还在进行的犯罪活动，供认不讳。这一活动也为其他被告证实了。
    尼可拉·巴夫洛夫·科列夫犯有起诉书中所举各项罪状。
    四、尼可拉·纳切夫·彼特科夫。在说明尼可拉·纳切夫的犯罪活动的特点时，起诉人指出，纳切夫自一九四一年以来就为英国情报处服务，并且是保加利亚法西斯警察的特务。他与基里尔·斯拉沃夫保有密切关系，后者也与英国情报处保有联系。
    尼可拉·纳切夫布置特拉伊科·科斯托夫与基里尔·斯拉沃夫的联系，同时经过基里尔·斯拉沃夫以情报供给英国情报处。
    在彻底考查过了纳切夫之后，特拉伊科·科斯托夫便请他参加阴谋组织。纳切夫同意了。起诉人说，科斯托夫向纳切夫说明，他应该招雇人，专门在与西方国家保有联系的人中挑选。纳切夫招雇了季米特尔，科契米多夫及鲍里斯·克里斯多夫。
    起诉人称：被告已亲自告诉你们，他曾进行怠工和破坏，并举出若干关于破坏的具体事例。
    起诉人认为被告尼可拉·纳切夫所犯的罪是确定了的，因此必须按起诉书定罪。
    五、鲍里斯·安多诺夫·克里斯托夫。起诉人称：被告对起诉书所控罪状已服罪。他供认（载于审判记录第二百七十三页）如下：“最后我承认特拉伊科·科斯托夫曾拉我进行对保加利亚人民的颠覆和敌对工作。我承认我曾进行破坏保加利亚与苏联的关系的工作。我承认我曾奉特拉伊科·科斯托夫之命供给南斯拉夫贸易参赞以间谍情报。”因此他对判决书中所举的罪状服罪。
    克里斯托夫的罪行不仅从他的供词中得到了确定，而且从其他被告——伊凡·斯捷法诺夫与特拉伊科·科斯托夫——的供词中也得到了确定。因此他必须对起诉书中对他所列罪状负责。
    六、伊凡·斯拉沃夫·杰夫列诺夫。起诉人追溯杰夫列诺夫成为谋叛组织之一员的情形，他指出：其后被告本人还拉别人参加这个组织。
    他曾网罗阿塔纳斯·尼波利耶夫，齐吉·卡桑杰夫，与米哈尔·杰拉斯莫夫参加谋叛组织。正如他自己所承认的，他知道这些人是保加利亚共产党的敌人。
    杰夫列诺夫履行他所接受的破坏任务，曾成功地使若干企业减产。
    专家委员会的结论、文件与被告的供词证明：（１）杰夫列夫是谋叛组织的一员；（２）他曾进行予保加利亚以巨大损害的怠工及破坏活动，并指导这些活动的进行；（３）按照斯拉沃夫的训令，他曾给英国以关于保加利亚国营工业状况的情报，从而犯了叛国罪，因此必须予以定罪。
    起诉人结语称：法官同志们，冷静和客观地估计一下被告们的破坏活动使我们的国家和人民蒙受了多么大的损害；他们的间谍活动对我们国家的安全引起了什么样的危害。估计一下如果他们敢于从事他们所准备的政变，那会给予我们的国家以什么样的危险。
    法官同志们，我相信你们的判决会是公正的。你们的判决必定会向我们国内的反动派和外国敌人表明，我们能够以一切方法来保卫我们人民的政权，保卫我们沿着走向社会主义的道路的发展和我们劳动群众的安宁和繁荣。
    我们将以你们将要宣布的判决，向我们的敌人表明：祖国阵线及我们全体人民坚持着他们在一九四四年九月九日所赢得的阵地，他们准备打击那些胆敢攻击他们阵地的任何人。
