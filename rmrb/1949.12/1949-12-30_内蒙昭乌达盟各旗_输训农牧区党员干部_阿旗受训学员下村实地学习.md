　　Inner Mongolia Zhaowuda League 各地 winter training work is actively underway. The first phase of the Party Training Class organized by the CPC A Banner Committee began on November 12th and ended on November 26th, training fifty Party members from pastoral areas. The second phase also began on November 29th. The village construction and political training class organized by the Banner government trained sixty-six cadres from November 1st to 15th. The second phase has begun training 114 cadres for construction and land certificate issuance. CPC committees and banner governments in Dongzhong Banner, Donghou Banner, and other places are also vigorously organizing rotational training for Party members and village cadres.

　　The main purpose of winter training work is to rectify the ideology of Party members and cadres, raise class consciousness, summarize the experience of leading production, and improve work ability. In the training class organized by the A Banner government, the trainees were divided into groups and went to the villages to conduct practical study on construction and land certificate issuance.

　　After this study, most of the cadres improved their thinking and their work style changed significantly. For example, Zhao Chun, the village chief of Hailatu Village in the Fourth District of Ba Left Banner, used to make arbitrary decisions in his work, had no planning, acted independently, and was afraid to have the masses raise issues with him. Since receiving training, his work style has greatly changed. He has established a division of labor and a meeting system among the cadres, and he checks and reports on the work on time. Xu Fengqi, a village cadre in Xinglongshan Village, used to only care about personal production. After returning to the village from training, he actively led the masses in production work, established a village cooperative, educated two second-rate members to go up the mountain to burn charcoal, and helped the masses develop production plans.

　  阿旗受训学员下村实地学习
    【本报讯】内蒙昭乌达盟各地冬训工作正积极展开。中共阿旗旗委开办的党训班第一期从十一月十二日开始，至十一月二十六日已告结束，训练了牧业区党员五十名。第二期亦已于十一月二十九日开始。该旗旗政府开办的村建政训练班，从十一月一日至十五日已训练干部六十六名。第二期又开始训练建政及办理颁发地照工作的干部一百一十四名。东中旗、东后旗等地中共党委和旗政府，亦正大力组织党员与村干部的轮训工作。
    各地冬训工作的主要目的，是在于整顿党员、干部思想，提高阶级觉悟，总结领导生产经验，提高工作能力。在阿旗旗政府开办的训练班中，受训的干部曾分编小组，下到村里去实地学习建政与颁发地照工作。
    经过了这次学习的干部，大部思想都提高了一步，作风亦有了显著的转变。如巴左旗四区海拉吐村村长赵春，过去工作中犯包办代替毛病，工作无计划，闹独立性，群众有意见也不敢向他提。自受训后，他的作风大有转变，在干部间建立了分工及会议等制度，并按时检查与汇报工作。兴隆山村村干徐凤岐，过去只顾个人生产，从受训回村后即积极领导群众的生产工作，建立了一个村联社，教育了两个二流子上山烧炭，又帮助群众订出生产计划。
