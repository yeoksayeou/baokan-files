    I would like to express my thanks to you on behalf of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Chinese authorities gave us extremely warm hospitality when we held the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference in your country and convened the WFTU Executive Bureau meeting in Beijing.
    Today, as we leave your country, we feel that the solidarity of workers all over the world and the harmony and friendship among people, which serve as the foundation for all policies of peace, have been greatly consolidated.
    We congratulate the Chinese people on their greatest success in building their new people's motherland, and congratulate them on inflicting the most thorough defeat on their enemies. We will make the whole world realize that the creation of the People's Democratic China has historical importance for the interests and future of people all over the world.
    Please accept, Minister, my best wishes.
