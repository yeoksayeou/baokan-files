【Our Newspaper News】Since the news of Chairman Mao Zedong's visit to the Soviet Union and meeting with Marshal Stalin reached factories in Beijing, a joyful and inspiring atmosphere has filled workshops, squares, clubs, and workers' dormitories for days. Workers have unanimously used their labor enthusiasm to celebrate this historically significant piece of good news.

When the extra edition of the newspaper reporting Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union reached the Nancheng Tram Repair Factory on the evening of the 17th, the workers, who had just finished their shift, completely forgot their fatigue and cheered and jumped for joy at the good news. Peng Zhennan, a young machinist, said to his fellow workers, "Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin are both our most trusted and respected leaders. The meeting of the two great leaders is a sign of the development of friendship between China and the Soviet Union." Then, he said, "At a time when American and British imperialists are clamoring for war, the two great leaders, representing the will of the people of both countries, have come together, let the imperialists see the strength of the world peace camp. This pair of iron fists will crush any conspiracy of aggression." The workers' enthusiasm for labor in the factory has been a hundred times higher in recent days.

The same enthusiasm also filled the Beijing Machine Factory. Workers discussed, "This is Chairman Mao's first time abroad. In Moscow, he not only met with Marshal Stalin, but also met with the leaders and representatives of various new democratic countries. The world peace front will be further consolidated." Hu Guang, the factory director, said excitedly, "With the Soviet Union in the world, and the great Stalin, and now a new China with a population of 475 million liberated people and the great Chairman Mao, everything will be easier to handle in the future."

On Sunday, in the square of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, the news of Chairman Mao's visit to Moscow spread. The young workers who were engaged in half-day voluntary labor immediately cheered and jumped. They forgot their fatigue. They originally planned to carry 800 weeding hoes, but after calculation, they carried 1,000. They unanimously believed that Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union this time must bring back better and newer experiences from the Soviet Union to lead the great construction of new China. Today, they are carrying relatively simple agricultural machinery, but they believe that in the near future, relying on the workers' creativity and wisdom, as well as the help of the Soviet big brother, they will produce more and newer types of machines. They looked forward to the beautiful scenery of China's agricultural mechanization with infinite excitement. At the birthday celebration party on the 21st, the workers of the whole factory cheered enthusiastically and sang heartily, wishing Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao eternal health. From the 18th to today, everywhere you can hear workers talking about Chairman Mao's visit to Moscow.

In the 70th Arsenal, the news of Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union was broadcast to the whole factory through more than 80 loudspeakers, which set off a frenzy of celebration. The workers expressed their willingness to celebrate with their labor enthusiasm. The female workers in the clothing factory also expressed great excitement. Wu Yaxian, a female worker in the second branch factory, said, "We have proposed to step up production and work hard to save money to express our female workers' celebration of this good news."

【Our Newspaper News】The news of the meeting between the leaders of the Chinese and Soviet people greatly excited the soldiers of the Public Security Corps and the Railway Corps. They held small discussion meetings to discuss it enthusiastically. In the discussion, the soldiers of each unit unanimously believed that this not only showed the deep friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union and the strength of the world's democratic forces, but also, following the founding of the People's Republic of China, was another major event that made the imperialists tremble. Zhang Juting of the Guard Company of the Third Regiment of the Public Security said: "Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union was to express the gratitude of the entire Chinese people to the Soviet Union and its leader, Comrade Stalin. I am very honored that there is also a share of me in the gift that Chairman Mao brought." In the discussion, he more deeply expressed his understanding, he said: "Chairman Mao's appearance in Moscow, the Soviet Union, as the leader of the victorious Chinese country, must be a great encouragement to all colonial and semi-colonial countries in the world, and conversely a great blow to the stateists headed by American imperialism." The soldiers of the Guard Company of the Railway Corps Command said in the discussion that, "For the imperialists, it should also be said that Chairman Mao went to the Soviet Union with the victory of the struggle against them." All the soldiers believed that Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union will enable us to begin victorious construction. Chairman Mao will surely bring us back more experience in building the country. Li Changhe, a soldier of the Third Regiment of Public Security, said: "I am determined to start by responding to Chairman Mao's instruction that 'the army should participate in production and construction work,' and to respond to the government's call for thrift, to assist the government in completing construction tasks. At the same time, we are also determined to do a good job in public security, to protect the capital, to protect Chairman Mao, and to protect our victorious construction." The soldiers of the Railway Corps unanimously believed that without the help of the Soviet Union, the Railway Corps would not have achieved today's achievements. Zhao Furen and Wang Fu, soldiers of the Guard Company of the Headquarters, said: "In our most difficult times, Stalin did his best to help us. The Soviet experts and engineers hired by our country taught us personally day and night, through wind and rain, so that this peasant army became a veritable railway soldier."

    【本报讯】中央人民政府毛泽东主席访苏会见斯大林大元帅的消息传到北京市各工厂后，几天以来，欢欣鼓舞的气氛一直充满着各车间、广场、俱乐部和职工宿舍，工人们一致用劳动热情来庆祝这一世界上具有伟大历史意义的喜讯。
    当十七日晚上报导毛主席访苏的号外新闻传到南城电车修造厂时，刚刚下了班的工人完全忘掉了疲乏，为这一喜讯欢呼跳跃。青年机工彭振南向他的工友们说：“毛主席和斯大林大元帅，都是我们最信任最敬爱的领袖，两大领袖的会见，是中苏两国友谊发展的标志。”接着，他说：“在美英帝国主义正在叫嚣战争的时候，两大领袖代表着两国人民的意志汇合在一起了，让帝国主义者看看世界和平阵营力量的强大吧。这一双铁拳将要击碎任何侵略阴谋。”该厂工人们的劳动热情几天来都是高涨百倍。
    同样的热情也充满了北京机器厂，工人们纷纷议论：“毛主席这是第一次出国，在莫斯科不但会见了斯大林大元帅，和各新民主主义国家的领袖们代表们也都见面了，世界和平阵线将更进一步的巩固。”该厂胡光厂长兴奋地说：“世界上有了个苏联，又有了伟大的斯大林，现在更有一个四万万七千五百万人民解放了的新中国和伟大的毛主席，今后一切事情更好办了。”
    星期日在华北农业机械厂的广场上，传来了毛主席去莫斯科的消息，正在从事半日义务劳动青年工人们，立即欢呼跳跃起来，他们忘记了疲劳，本来计划搬运八百部耘锄，结果一算却搬运了一千部。他们一致认为：这次毛主席访苏，一定要带回来苏联更好的更新的经验，领导新中国的伟大建设事业。他们今天搬运着比较简单的农业机械，但他相信不久的将来，依靠工人们的创造和智慧以及苏联老大哥的帮助，将要制出更大量的更新式的机器，他们无限兴奋地瞻望了中国农业机械化的美景。在二十一日祝寿的晚会上，全厂工人们狂热的欢呼，纵情的歌唱，祝斯大林大元帅和毛主席永远健康。从十八日起直到今天，到处都可听到工人们对毛主席去莫斯科的谈论。
    在七十兵工厂，毛主席访苏的消息曾经用八十多个扩音喇叭向全厂播送，掀起了狂欢的热潮，工人们表示要以劳动的热情来庆祝。被服厂的女工们，也表示极大的兴奋，第二分厂女工吴雅贤说：“我们已提出了加紧生产，努力节约，来表示我们女工对这件喜讯的庆祝。”

    【本报讯】中苏人民领袖会晤的消息大大兴奋了公安总队与铁道兵团的战士们，他们纷纷召开小型座谈会热烈讨论。在讨论中，各部战士一致认为这不仅表明了中苏两大民族的深厚友谊与世界民主力量的壮大，同时也是继中华人民共和国成立之后，又一次使帝国主义者们发抖的大事件。公安三团警卫连的张巨亭说：“毛主席的访苏是带着全中国人民对苏联及其领袖斯大林同志的感谢去的。我很荣幸，毛主席带去的这件礼品中也有我的一份。”在讨论中，他更深刻的道出了自己的认识，他说：“毛主席作为胜利的中国国家的领袖出现在苏联的莫斯科，对全世界各殖民地与半殖民地的国家必然是一个很大的鼓舞，相反的对于以美帝为首的国主义者们就是一个很大的打击。”铁道兵团司令部警卫连的战士们在座谈中，战士郑景贵与蒲秀文说：“对帝国主义者们说，还应该说毛主席是带着对他们斗争的胜利去苏联的。”所有的战士们都认为毛主席的访苏将使我们开始胜利的建设。毛主席也一定会给我们带回更多的建国经验来。公安三团的战士李长和说：“我坚决从响应毛主席‘军队参加生产建设工作’的指示作起，从响应政府的节约号召作起，来协助政府完成建设任务，同时我们也决心作好公安工作，保卫首都、保卫毛主席，保卫我们的胜利建设。”铁道兵团的战士们更一致认为：没有苏联的帮助，铁道兵团也不会有今天的成绩。司令部警卫连的战士赵福仁与王福说：“在我们最困难的时候，斯大林尽力帮助我们，由我国聘请的苏联专家和工程师们没白天没黑夜的，风里雨里的亲自教导我们，才使这支农民队伍成为名符其实的铁道兵。”
