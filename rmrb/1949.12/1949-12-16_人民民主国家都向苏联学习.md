—Editor's Note

The People's Democratic countries of Central and Southeastern Europe recently celebrated the fifth anniversary of their existence. Reviewing the outstanding achievements of these five years, the working people of these countries, with confidence in the future, warmly thank the powerful socialist Soviet Union and the world people's leader, Stalin.

The Soviet Union liberated the people of Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Albania from fascist enslavement, opening up the road to socialism for them. The Soviet Union protects the sovereignty and independence of the People's Democratic countries from the sinister encroachments of Anglo-American imperialists. The Soviet Union provides assistance to the People's Democratic countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields. Soviet machinery, equipment, raw materials, and Soviet technical assistance enable these countries to accelerate the recovery of industry, transportation, and agriculture, and to carry out construction along socialist lines. This year, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria experienced poor harvests, and Soviet grain greatly helped the people of these countries maintain their food supply.

But there is another kind of help, a kind that is not calculated by weight, money, or production capacity. This is the help that the Soviet Union's practical experience in building socialism provides to these countries.

When the Soviet state was first established in 1917, there were no precedents, no examples to teach the Soviet people how to build socialism. But the genius of Lenin and Stalin pointed out the road, and the Soviet people, with tireless efforts, built the edifice of socialism stone by stone in endless struggles. In this country that spans Europe and Asia and whose nations, economies, cultures, and other characteristics are incomparably disparate, everything needed to be rebuilt from scratch, with no historical precedents to follow. Everything had to be built and tested in practice, explored and verified in practice.

In this way, over more than thirty years, the Soviet Union accumulated a wealth of experience in realizing the ideas of Lenin and Stalin—experience in establishing the most advanced social and political system in history. This experience includes many aspects of people's lives: experience in fighting class enemies, fighting imperialist bandits and their agents; experience in establishing state institutions and creating socialist countries; experience in socialist planning, socialist industrialization, and agricultural construction; experience in carrying out cultural revolutions and cultivating new intellectuals; experience in diplomacy; experience in establishing the armed forces of socialist countries to defend against imperialist aggression; and experience in educating the people with a new socialist consciousness and the new ethics of communist builders. All of these diverse and rich experiences of the Soviet people in heroic struggle and creative labor under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party have been synthesized by Stalin into general theoretical principles, which are written in his works.

They generously share these brilliant treasures of experience (which the Soviet people increase every day and every hour in the gradual transition to socialism!) with the people of the world, especially with the fraternal people of the People's Democratic countries, for common enjoyment. The working people of Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Albania widely absorb the rich experience of the Soviet Union, using it to suit the specific characteristics of each country. The experience accumulated by the Soviet people in building society is being applied in the East as well as in the West.

After finally being liberated from the agents of American imperialism—the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang—the leaders of the People's Republic of China, when drafting blueprints for national economic construction, learned from the experience that the Soviet Union gained in completing Stalin's socialist industrialization plan.

Mao Zedong, leader of the Chinese Communist Party, wrote: "...The imperialists calculate that we cannot manage the economy well... We must overcome difficulties, and we must learn what we do not understand... The CPSU is our best teacher, and we must learn from the CPSU."

It is not without reason that the people of the world unanimously thank the Soviet state and the great Stalin. The Korean people sing of Stalin: "The command post of the era, the conqueror of fascism, the great friend of the people everywhere!" There is also a song in Albania: "Stalin is also the whole world, we can't find a better friend than the Soviet Union!"

The Soviet state is built on the true democratic principles of socialism.

Stalin's experience points out: "In capitalist countries with antagonistic classes, democracy, in the final analysis, is only for the strong, for the propertied minority. On the contrary, in the Soviet Union, democracy is for the working people, that is to say, for the entire people."

The Stalin Constitution, in the words of Comrade Stalin, is "a document that proves with facts that everything that has been realized in the Soviet Union can also be fully realized in other countries." The basic principles of the socialist society established by the Soviet Union are reflected in the Constitution and stamped with the seal of legislation. What Comrade Stalin said thirty years ago has become a living fact today. In the People's Democratic countries, the power of the working class has been established, where the Soviet Union's experience in building socialist countries is naturally being utilized.

The Soviet Constitution is a "constitution of victorious socialism." The People's Democratic countries have embarked on the road to socialism and are victoriously resolving the task of transitioning from capitalism to socialism. Its constitution is a reflection of the rights won by the people of the People's Democratic countries, a reflection of the new political system of the society they created after the Soviet Union liberated these countries from the fascists, and consolidates it by legislative means. Their constitutions are based on the principle of equality of all races and nationalities; on strict and thorough principles, and emphasize guaranteeing civil rights and practical methods of implementation.

Approaching the early completion of the Stalin Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union has accumulated countless experiences in national economic planning. For many years, the Soviet national economy has been determined and guided by state plans, the purpose of which is to multiply the nation's social wealth, gradually improve the material and cultural standards of the people, defend the independence of the Soviet Union, and strengthen national defense.

The principles and methods of Soviet socialist planning have served as, and are serving as, a guide for action in the People's Democratic countries. The successful completion of Poland's Three-Year Plan, Czechoslovakia's Two-Year Plan, Hungary's Three-Year Plan, and Bulgaria's Two-Year Plan and Romania's similar plan demonstrates that these countries are utilizing the Soviet Union's experience, adapting it to their own specific conditions, and that this is the guarantee of their initial success in the socialist construction of the national economy.

The Soviet Union is the first country in history to demonstrate the role of socialist competition, which is to encourage the creative initiative of millions of people and expand the scope and strength of their labor. The epoch-making significance of socialist competition was discovered by Lenin and Stalin. According to Stalin, this is "a lever, with the help of which the working class can complete the task of building the national economy and cultural life on a socialist basis."

The workers under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the People's Democratic countries have seen the creativity of socialist competition born in the Soviet Union, so it is not surprising that they have adopted it. In 1945-46, advanced workers in Poland began a labor competition. Millions of Polish workers learned from the example of the Soviet working class and participated in this movement. By 1947, Polish worker party member and veteran miner Strausski was the first in the country to complete 260 percent of his production quota and challenged other miners to compete with him, and this movement greatly developed. Thousands upon thousands of workers were encouraged by Strausski's example. He is called "Poland's Stakhanov."

The workers of the People's Democratic countries not only learn from the Soviet Union through books and newspapers. Outstanding Soviet workers, leaders in socialist competition, went to these countries to educate their comrades with their own examples. In 1947, Boriskin, a Stakhanov movement activist from the Moscow coalfield, went to Bairnek to teach Bulgarian workers how to drill several coal faces at the same time. He went down the mine and practically taught them how to achieve high-record coal sawing quantities. Stoykov, the creator of labor competition in Bulgaria and twice decorated for his labor achievements, said the following, indicating the significance of Stakhanov's methods for the Bulgarian workers:

"Boriskin's arrival was a turning point. The competition expanded widely, and production began to rise faster. In 1945, each coal miner dug two and a half tons of coal per shift, while in 1949 the number was seven tons."

The movement to produce high-quality goods initiated by Zhutkikh, the foreman of the Moscow Krasnokholmsky Woolen Factory, immediately resonated in the People's Democratic countries. Zhutkikh received a letter from a group of Bulgarian textile workers, telling him that they had organized a "Zhutkikh Team" to produce first-class quality goods. They wrote:

"We, the female workers of the Bulgarian Vilabisova factory, inspired by the achievements of our Soviet brothers and sisters and learning from their experience, decided to organize ourselves into a high-quality team according to your example."

Zhutkikh wrote back, detailing their methods and wishing the Bulgarian comrades success.

Every progressive method created in Soviet production is widely applied in the People's Democratic countries. Hungarian train drivers are making new record achievements after studying the experience of Soviet Stakhanov workers. Polish shoemakers are beginning to adopt the methods of Soviet Stakhanov worker Matrosov. In Romania, many high-speed lathes are hung with portraits of Leningrad worker Boltkiewicz, who initiated the high-speed machine use movement. In Bucharest's weaving mills, one can see portraits of the textile workers Volkova and Ivanov—these people's examples stimulate Romanian textile workers to improve their work.

Of inestimable value to the People's Democratic countries is the Soviet Union's implementation of the Lenin-Stalin cooperative plan. Lenin and Stalin said that the Soviet Union's socialist construction is a profound revolution, the result of which is equivalent to the October Revolution of 1917. The Soviet Union, which went from having 25 million small farms each scattered with primitive tools by its owners, to being a great industrial and collective farm power, has demonstrated to the world the absolute superiority of socialist agriculture built on the basis of collective labor and modern agricultural machinery.

The outstanding achievements of Soviet collective farm peasants have made the peasants of the People's Democratic countries eager to grasp their methods and experience and apply them to their own countries in order to end years of backwardness and poverty.

Bulgarian farmers, after seeing the story of the Blagoev Collective Farm in the Odessa region of Ukraine in the newspaper, wrote to the "Fatherland Front" newspaper asking about the lives of Soviet collective farmers. Ukrainian collective farmers wrote ten replies, all of which were published in this newspaper. These replies aroused great interest in the Bulgarian countryside, in labor agricultural cooperatives, and in machine and tractor stations. Bulgarian farmers called these replies "pathfinders," which is a very fitting description.

It has become common practice for delegations of farmers from the People's Democratic countries to visit the Soviet Union. Delegations of farmers from Romania, Poland, Albania, and Hungary have all visited collective farms in the Soviet Union. A large delegation of Czech farmers is currently in the Soviet Union. Hungarian newspapers published a report from that country's delegation, which said:

"The farmers of Hungary sincerely thank the Soviet people. The Soviet army not only brought us freedom. Without its heroic liberation struggle, we would not have been able to realize our land reform. Now the Soviet people have opened up for us the most precious treasure—the Soviet farmers' thirty years of rich experience."

Polish farmers sent three delegations to learn about Soviet collective farms. One delegation leader, Kratko, said:

"What we saw in the Ukrainian collective farms impressed us deeply. Stalin's collective farm system has greatly changed the countryside and put the peasants on the right path. In these years after the war, Ukrainian socialist agriculture has made amazing achievements. Collective farmers live a prosperous and cultured life. We learned a lot from what we saw."

The achievements of advanced Soviet agricultural science, which works hand in hand with millions of farmers, have aroused profound interest in the People's Democratic countries.

Czech Minister of Agriculture Duris said: "The Czech Five-Year Plan stipulates that agricultural production will increase by 37 percent by the end of 1953... We are trying to ensure the completion of these tasks. The theories of Michurin and Lysenko are being widely applied to all animal and plant breeding... We carefully study Soviet agriculture. When our Czech and Slovak people visit Soviet collective farms and state farms, they are amazed by Soviet agriculture, and we are constantly learning from Soviet agricultural experience and achievements.

When applying Soviet experience to develop agricultural production cooperation and organize agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms, the leaders of the People's Democratic countries never forget that before they can eliminate the capitalist elements in the countryside, they must constantly try to limit them, strengthen the alliance of workers and peasants under the leadership of the working class, and develop socialist industry in order to supply agriculture with the technological re-equipment.

In a short historical period, the Soviet Union realized a cultural revolution. The cultural level was raised to an unprecedented height, and socialist new intellectuals, people's intellectuals, were created.

The People's Democratic countries are learning from the Soviet Union's cultural revolution experience. The People's Republic of Poland inherited from the old regime four million illiterate and semi-literate people. The methods and organizational forms for eliminating illiteracy that had been implemented in the Soviet Union with great success about twenty years ago are being applied in Poland with good results. The Polish parliament passed regulations to eliminate illiteracy and semi-illiteracy within three years.

Czechoslovakia has drawn on the Soviet example and opened workers' supplementary classes to prepare workers and peasants for enrollment. Scientists, writers, filmmakers, actors, artists, musicians, and doctors from the People's Democratic countries study and apply the achievements of Soviet socialist culture—the most advanced culture in the world, consciously bearing the mission of serving the people.

The Soviet Union is the birthplace of the most progressive and revolutionary ideology—Leninism. As a force for mobilization, organization, and construction, the ideas of Lenin and Stalin, his great power, have been confirmed by the entire course of social development in the first half of the twentieth century—especially in the thirty-two years since the great October Revolution.

The famous British scientist Bernal wrote: "Nowhere outside the Soviet Union is there a philosophical system worth mentioning that can gain widespread belief and encourage action."

Bernal spoke of bourgeois philosophical theories as "anti-intellectual" and "bestial" beliefs, reflecting the bankruptcy of capitalism. He said:

"Only a Marxist understanding can show that the banner of 'Western civilization' being unfurled for a new war of destruction is precisely the battle flag that Hitler Goebbels intended to use to gather deceived people for an anti-communist war."

Just as the American imperialists, under the banner of cosmopolitanism, combine the preaching of bestial nationalism with calls to eliminate the sovereignty of other countries, the working masses are learning from the Soviet Union and raising the banner of proletarian internationalism. The entire thirty-two-year history of the socialist country proves that the people of the Soviet Union have consistently realized the great Stalin's call: "Be faithful to proletarian internationalism to the end." The working people abide by this call and learn from the experience of the Soviet people (who have clearly demonstrated in many things and are demonstrating that they organically combine international solidarity with the lofty feelings of Soviet patriotism), wage a relentless struggle against any manifestation of bourgeois nationalism, and at the same time expose national nihilism.

Stalin said: "An internationalist is ready to defend the Soviet Union unreservedly, without hesitation, and unconditionally." This undeniable truth has taken root in the hearts of the masses all over the world.

Progressive humanity yearns to acquire progressive ideology, the communist ideology—Leninism.

Among the working masses of the People's Democratic countries, the irresistible desire to study the ideas of Lenin and Stalin is growing. The workers of the People's Democratic countries, especially the vanguard of the workers—the Communist Party members, regard Stalin's works and the history of the CPSU as a manual for building socialism and a guide for combat.

The Soviet Union's supply of its rich and diverse experience to the People's Democratic countries has helped them immeasurably. In the eyes of the People's Democratic countries, the Soviet Union's experience is the best and most tested roadmap to socialism, and the writings of Lenin and Stalin are a reliable compass. The working people of these countries do not have to go down untrodden roads to socialism. Many of the difficulties that the Soviet people—the pioneers in establishing the most progressive social and political new system—had to overcome are unnecessary for them.

The words of Xiyanko, the captain of the Stalin Collective Farm in Ukraine, to the Polish farmers' delegation, express this idea. He first detailed the achievements of the collective farm to the visitors, and then he said:

"It is easier for you now. You have a place to learn and seek experience. When we organized the collective farms, there was no example to follow. But, look at our achievements."

The People's Democratic countries are absorbing the latest achievements of Soviet experience in building a new socialist society. Participants in the labor competition followed and adopted the latest experience of Soviet communist builders. By borrowing and creatively adopting Soviet experience, the People's Democratic countries and their people, under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party, can accelerate their progress and shorten the time it takes to transition to socialism.

The workers of Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Albania know this. The words of the Polish writer Rudnicki vividly express this gratitude to the Soviet Union:

"From every advanced worker group in industry, from every bricklayer shock brigade that exceeds the production quota, from every agricultural production cooperative, we see the great influence of the Soviet people, who teach us to be masters of the country. If most of the Polish people have only been engaged in building socialism for five years, the experience of their vanguard must be counted as thirty years—the Soviet state has existed for thirty years. That is why we are creating true miracles today."

× × ×

The People's Democratic countries are growing stronger and moving towards socialism with the help of the great Soviet Union and the application of its experience; this has made the Anglo-American imperialists irritable. They scream in hoarse voices: "The hand of Moscow!" They drag out the weapons of anti-communist slander, crudely imitating what their predecessors—Curzon, Hoover, Goebbels and others—did. But those who hate and are hostile to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries do not see that their weapons have rusted to the point of being unusable.

In the words of Barbusse, people all over the world are "guided by a great example." They are learning from the Soviet Union, and will continue to learn from the Soviet Union, how to fight for peace, democracy, and socialism, and how to obtain the right to a better life. It is no wonder that Anglo-American imperialists have to mix some spiritually bankrupt confessions with their anti-Soviet clamor.

Really, what can they teach humanity? The "art" of cruel exploitation? The "technique" of deception and conspiracy? Fascist methods of rule? War-mongering? Did Dulles not once admit frankly at a foreign ministers' meeting that the American delegation could not say what the definition of "democracy" was? Dulles said: "We find this difficult, and I don't think we've done enough." How can we expect Dulles to give the only correct definition of "democracy," thus proving that "democracy," as understood by American imperialists, is reactionary and fascist, is the negation of all democracy?

As for the anti-Soviet clamor, the working people know very well that these despicable and filthy anti-Soviet slanders are worthless. The Soviet Union has torn off the masks of the enemies of peace and the Anglo-American war-mongers who stifle democracy and the Tito traitors of the imperialist camp. The Soviet Union's victories in the field of peaceful labor give the working masses new strength—the working people regard the Soviet state as the natural leader of the anti-imperialist and democratic camp.

The famous Chinese scholar Guo Moruo said: "The Chinese people are very clear about the war intentions of American imperialism... We Chinese believe that if we want to guarantee peace, the international peace movement must be led by the Soviet Union, the most reliable fortress of peace."

Bishop Johnson of Canterbury said at the Soviet Peace Conference held in Moscow: "You are active socialist pioneers, that is, pioneers of peace. We are pleased to express to you how grateful we are to you."

French representative, writer Lafayette said: "People of the Soviet Union, we thank you for giving us new strength to fight for peace and win victory."

The great Soviet Union is giving the People's Democratic countries fraternal and selfless help. It provides the peoples of these countries with the rich treasure trove of experience in building socialism. That is why the Soviet Union enjoys such a high degree of spiritual authority and prestige. No one can shake it.

　　人民民主国家都向苏联学习
    莱昂尼多夫著  石谷译
    此文原题“经验的宝藏”登于“新时代”，第四十六期。为了更恰当地表达本文的内容起见，改用今题。
　　——编者注
    中欧和东南欧人民民主国家最近庆祝了它们存在的五周年。这些国家的劳动人民回顾五年中杰出的成就，对将来具有信心，热烈地感谢社会主义的强大的苏联和世界人民领袖斯大林。
    苏联把罗马尼亚、波兰、捷克斯拉夫、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚的人民，从法西斯的奴役下解放了，为他们打开了走向社会主义的道路。苏联保护人民民主国家的主权和独立，不受英美帝国主义者罪恶的侵犯。苏联给人民民主国家政治、经济、文化各方面的帮助。苏联的机器、设备、原料和苏联的技术援助，使这些国家加紧恢复工业、运输和农业，和依照社会主义的路线进行建设。今年罗马尼亚、捷克、和保加利亚歉收，苏联的谷物大大帮助了这些国家人民维持食粮的供给。
    但还有一种帮助，一种不是以重量钱数或生产能力来计算的帮助。这就是苏联建设社会主义实际经验对这些国家所给予的帮助。
    在一九一七年苏维埃国家初创的时候，没有先例，没有榜样教给苏联人民怎样建设社会主义。但列宁和斯大林的天才指出了道路，苏联人民以不倦的努力，在无休止的斗争中，一块块石头地建立起了社会主义的大厦。在这个横跨欧亚地区和各民族、经济、文化、及其他特点无比参差的国家中，一切都曾需要从新建立，在历史上没有先例可以依据。一切都要建筑，并在实际建筑中考验，要在探索并在实际探索中证实。
    象这样，在三十多年中，苏联积垒了实现列宁、斯大林思想的丰富经验——建立历史上最先进的社会的和政治的制度的经验。这些经验包括人民生活的多方面：与阶级敌人斗争，对帝国主义强盗及其代理人斗争的经验；建立国家机构和创造社会主义国家的经验；社会主义计划，社会主义工业化和农业建设的经验；实现文化革命和培养新的知识分子的经验；外交方面的经验；建立社会主义国家的武装，防御帝国主义侵略的经验；把新的社会主义的意识及共产主义建立者的新伦理教育人民的经验。所有这些体现在布尔塞维克党领导下的苏联人民的英勇斗争和创造劳动的各种各样的丰富经验，都被斯大林天才化合成为一般理论原则，写在他的著作中。
    他们将这些经验的灿烂宝藏（苏联人民在逐步向社会主义过渡中，每天和每小时地在增加这宝藏！）慷慨地分给全世界的人民，首先是给兄弟般的人民民主国家的人民，共同享用。罗马尼亚、保加利亚、捷克、波兰、匈牙利和阿尔巴尼亚的劳动人民，广泛地吸取苏联丰富的经验，利用它，使其适合于各国的具体特点。苏联人民在建设社会中所积垒的经验，正在应用于东方，也和应用于西方一样。
    从美帝国主义的代理人——反动的蒋介石匪帮——手中终于获得解放以后，中华人民共和国的领袖们，在起草国家经济建设的蓝图时，向苏联在完成斯大林社会主义工业化计划中所获得的经验学习。
    中国共产党领袖毛泽东写道：“……帝国主义者算定我们办不好经济。……我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。……。联共就是我们的最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习。”
    全世界人民一致感谢苏维埃国家和伟大的斯大林，并不是无因的。朝鲜人民这样歌唱斯大林：“时代的司令台，法西斯的征服者，一切地方人民的伟大朋友！”在阿尔巴尼亚也有一只歌：“斯大林也就是全世界，我们再也找不到比苏联更好的朋友！”
  　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    苏维埃国家是建立在社会主义真正民主原则之上。
    斯大林经验指出：“在具有敌对阶级的资本主义国家中，分析到最后，民主只是为着强者，为着有产的少数人。相反地，在苏联，民主是为着劳动人民，这就是说，为着全体人民。”
    斯大林宪法用斯大林同志的话来说，乃是“一个文件，它用事实证明了凡是在苏联所已实现的，在其他国家也都完全可能实现。”苏联所建立的社会主义社会的基本原则，反映在宪法中，并在此盖了立法的铃记。斯大林同志三十年前说的话，今天都变成为活生生的事实。在人民民主国家中，工人阶级的政权已经建立了，在那里，苏联建设社会主义国家的经验，自然是正被利用着。
    苏联宪法是“胜利的社会主义的宪法”。人民民主国家已经走上了社会主义的道路，和正在胜利解决由资本主义过渡到社会主义的任务。它的宪法，是人民民主国家的人民所争得的权利的反映，是苏联从法西斯手中把这些国家解放以后它们所创造的社会的政治的新制度的反映，并用立法手段巩固之。它们的宪法建立在一切种族和民族平等的原则上；在严格的彻底的原则上，产且强调保证公民权利和切实执行的方法。
    接近提前完成斯大林五年计划的苏联，积垒了国民经济计划的无数经验。多年以来，苏联的国民经济，是由国家计划来决定和指导的，计划的目的是使全国的社会的财产倍增，逐步提高人民的物质及文化水平，保卫苏联独立和加强国防。
    苏联社会主义计划的原则和方法，曾作为，并正作为人民民主国家行动的指南。波兰的三年计划，捷克的二年计划，匈牙利的三年计划和保加利亚的二年计划与罗马尼亚相类似的计划都胜利完成了，这就是说明了这些国家正利用苏联的经验，使其适合本国的特殊条件，它们进行国家经济的社会主义建设的最初成就的保证，就在这里。
    苏联是历史上第一个国家表现了社会主义竞赛的作用，是鼓励千百万群众创造的主动性，和扩张他的劳动范围和力量。社会主义竞争的划时代的重要性是列宁和斯大林所发现的。照斯大林的说法，这是“一根杠杆，由于它的帮助，工人阶级就能够完成在社会主义基础上建立全国经济的和文化的生活之任务。”
    人民民主国家共产党和工人党领导下的工人，曾看出诞生在苏联的社会主义竞赛的创造力，因此他们之采用它，是无足奇的。一九四五—四六年波兰先进工人们开始了劳动的竞赛。千万的波兰工人学习苏联劳动阶级的榜样，参加此一运动。到一九四七年，波兰工人党员老矿工斯特劳斯基在国内首先完成生产定额百分之二百六十，并且向其他矿工挑战，要他们和他竞赛，这个运动也大为开展。成千成万的工人受了斯特劳斯基榜样的鼓励。人们称他为“波兰的斯达汉诺夫。”
    人民民主国家的工人不仅从书报中向苏联学习。出色的苏联工人，社会主义竞赛中的领袖们，到这些国家去，用自身的例子教育其同志。在一九四七年，莫斯科煤田的斯达汉诺夫运动者保立斯金到拜尔涅克去，教保加利亚工人同时钻几个煤面的方法。他下矿去，用实际上教给他们如何获得高纪录的锯煤量。保加利亚劳动竞赛的提创者和两次因劳动成绩获得奖章的斯多益科夫，说了下面这段话，表明斯达汉诺夫方法的教育对于保加利亚工人的意义：
    “保立斯金的来到是一个转折点。竞赛广泛展开了，生产量开始更快上升。在一九四五年每个掘煤工人每班掘煤二吨半，而在一九四九年的数目是七吨。”
    莫斯科克拉斯诺霍木斯基毛织厂领班朱特赫所首创的生产上等质量物品的运动，立即在人民民主国家内得到响应。朱特基赫得到一群保加利亚纺织女工人的来信，告诉他：他们组织了一个“朱特基赫队”生产头等质量的货物。她们写道：
    “我们保加利亚维拉比斯可瓦工厂的女工，受苏联兄弟姊妹的成就所鼓舞，并学习他们的经验，决定照你们的榜样，将我们组织成为一个上等质量队。”
    朱特基赫去信时详细叙述他们的方法，并祝保加利亚同志们成就。
    苏联生产中创造的每一种进步方法，都在人民民主国家中广泛应用。匈牙利的火车司机们，在研究了苏联的斯达汉诺夫工作者的经验之后，正在作出新纪录的成绩。波兰的制鞋工人正开始采用苏联斯达汉诺夫工作者马特洛索夫的方法。在罗马尼亚很多高速的车床上悬挂着创始高速机器使用运动的列宁格勒工人波尔特开维支的像片。在布加勒斯特的织布机上，可以看到伏尔可娃和依凡诺夫纺织工人的像片——这些人的榜样刺激罗马尼亚纺织工人提高工作。
    对于人民民主国家有难以估量的价值的，是苏联实行列宁斯大林合作计划。列宁斯大林说过的，苏联的社会主义建设，是一深刻的革命，其结果相等于一九一七年的十月革命。苏联从有二千五百万块小农田而每一块由所有者用原始的工具分散的国家，变为伟大的工业与集体农庄的强国，这就向全世界说明了建设在集体劳动及现代农业机械基础之上的社会主义农业的绝对优越性。
    苏联集体农庄农民的卓越成就，使人民民主国家农民的热望掌握他们的方法和经验，应用于本国，以便结束年代已久的落后与穷困。
    保加利亚的农民在报纸上看到乌克兰奥德塞区勃拉戈也夫集体农庄的故事，就写信给“祖国阵线报”询问关于苏联集体农民的生活。乌克兰集体农民们写了十封回信，都发表在这报上。这些回信在保加利亚乡村、在劳动农业合作社、和机器及拖拉机站，引起极大的兴趣。保加利亚的农民称这些为“带路人”，这是非常恰合的称道。
    人民民主国家的农民代表团访问苏联已成为常事。罗马尼亚，波兰，阿尔巴尼亚，和匈牙利的农民代表团都到苏联访问过集体农庄。有一个很大的捷克农民代表团现在正在苏联。匈牙利的报纸上发表了该国代表团的报告，其中说：
    “匈牙利的农民衷心感谢苏联人民。苏军不但带给我们自由。如果没有它英雄的解放斗争，我们就不能实现我国土地改革。现在苏联人民又为我们打开了最珍贵的宝库——苏联农民三十年的丰富经验。”
    波兰农民派遣了三个代表团去了解苏联的集体农庄。有一个代表团团长克拉特珂说：
    “我们在乌克兰集体农庄所看的，给我们深刻的印象。斯大林的集体农庄制度大大地改变了乡村，使农民走上了正路。在战后这几年中，乌克兰的社会主义农业作出了惊人的成绩。集体农民过着丰饶和文化的生活。我们从所看到的东西学到很多。”
    与千万农民携手合作的苏联先进农业科学的成就，引起人民民主国家深刻的兴趣。
    捷克农业部长都立斯说：“捷克五年计划规定一九五三年底农业增产百分之三十七。……我们正在设法保证完成这些任务。米邱林和李森科的学说正被广泛应用于一切动植物育种。……我们细心研究苏联的农业，在我们捷克和斯拉伐克人民参观苏联集体农庄和国营农庄时，对苏联农业引起羡慕，我们正经常向苏联农业经验和成就学习。
    在应用苏联经验来发展农业生产合作及组织农业生产合作社和国营农庄时，人民民主国家的领袖们决不遗忘：在能够消灭乡村的资本主义分子之前，必须不断设法限制他们，加强在工人阶级领导下的工农联盟，和发展社会主义工业，以便供给农业上的技术重新装备。
    在一个历史的短时期内，苏联实现了文化革命。将文化水平提到空前高度，和创造了社会主义的新知识分子，人民的知识分子。
    人民民主国家正在学习苏联文化革命经验。波兰人民共和国从旧政权承袭了四百万文盲和半文盲。约在二十年前，在苏联实行过有巨大成就的消灭文盲的方法与组织形式，正在波兰应用，成绩良好。波兰议会通过了在三年内清除文盲和半文盲的法规。
    捷克吸取苏联的榜样，开办了工人补习班，为工农入学的准备。人民民主国家的科学家、作家、影片家、演员、艺术家、音乐家、和医生研究并应用苏联社会主义文化——世界上最进的、自觉负有为人民服务的使命的文化——的成就。
    苏联是最进步和革命的思想意识——列宁主义——的诞生地。作为动员、组织、和建设的力量，列宁、斯大林思想，他的伟大力量已在二十世纪前半——尤其是伟大的十月革命以来的三十二年中——被全世界社会发展的全部过程所证实。
    著名的英国科学家贝纳尔写道：“除苏联外，任何地方都没有一种哲学上值得称道的思想体系，能够获得广泛的信仰并鼓励行动。”
    贝纳尔谈到资产阶级的哲学理论是“反理智的”和“禽兽的”信仰，反映了资本主义的破产，他说道：
    “只有马克思主义的了解，才能显示：为了新毁灭战争而展开的‘西方文明’的旗帜，正是希特勒戈贝尔打算用以集合受欺骗的人民进行反共战争的战旗”。
    正当美帝国主义者，在世界主义的旗帜下，将禽兽的民族主义的说教，结合着消灭别国的主权的号召时，工人群众向苏联学习，高举起无产阶级国际主义的大旗。社会主义国家全部三十二年的历史证明了苏联的人民始终不断的实现着伟大的斯大林的号召：“对无产阶级的国际主义忠实到底。”劳动人民信守这号召，和向苏联人民的经验学习（苏联人民在许多事情上，明显地表现了与正在表现他们将国际团结与苏维埃爱国主义崇高感情作有机的结合），向任何资产阶级民族主义的表现作无情的斗争，同时并暴露民族的虚无主义。
    斯大林说：“一个国际主义者是准备好毫无保留地、毫不犹豫地、和无条件地保卫苏联的。”这一无可置疑的真理言辞已根深蒂固地在全世界的群众心中。
    进步的人类渴望获得进步的思想意识、共产主义的思想意识——列宁主义。
    在人民民主国家的劳动群众中，学习列宁、斯大林思想的不可抗拒的欲望正在增长。人民民主国家的工人，尤其是工人的先锋队——共产党员，把斯大林的著作，联共党史，看作是建立社会主义的手册和战斗的指南。
    苏联将它丰富而多样的经验供给人民民主国家，这就无上地帮助了她们。在人民民主国家看来，苏联的经验乃是走向社会主义的道路最好的、经过了考验的路线图，而列宁、斯大林的著作乃是可靠的指南针。这些国家的劳动人民无须经过无人跑过的道路走向社会主义。苏联人民——建立最进步的社会和政治新制度的先驱——所不得不克服的许多困难，对他们均不必要了。
    乌克兰斯大林集体农庄队长西扬科向波兰农民代表团说的话，就表达了此一思想。他先向参观者详述了农庄的成就，然后他说：
    “你们现在就容易多了。你们有地方可学习，寻找经验。在我们组织集体农场时，还没有任何榜样。可是，你看我们的成就。”
    人民民主国家在建设社会主义新社会时，正吸取苏联经验的最近的成就。参加劳动竞赛者追随了和采用了苏联共产主义建设者的最近经验。由于借用着和创造地采用着苏联的经验，人民民主国家及其人民，在马列主义政党领导之下，能加速进展，缩短过渡到社会主义的时间。
    罗马尼亚、保加利亚、波兰、捷克、匈牙利、和阿尔巴尼亚的工人知道这个。波兰作家卢德尼基的话很生动地表现了这种对苏联的感谢：
    “从工业中每一个先进工人小组，从每一个超过生产定额的铺砖工人突击队，从每一个农业生产合作社，我们看到苏联人民伟大影响，他们教导我们作国家的主人。如果大多数的波兰人民从事建设社会主义只有五年，它们的先锋队的经验却必须算是三十年——苏维埃国家存在了三十年。这便为什么我们在今天创造真正奇迹的原因。”

    人民民主国家在伟大的苏联的帮助及应用其经验，而力量日益强大，并向社会主义前进；这使英美帝国主义者暴燥起来了。他们尖声喊哑嗓子：“莫斯科的手！”他们拖出反共谰言的武器，生硬地仿效其前辈——冠松，胡佛，戈贝尔一流人之所为。但憎恨和仇视苏联和人民民主国家的人没有看到他们的武器，已生锈到不堪使用的地步了。
    用巴比塞的话来说，全世界的人士在受“伟大的榜样的指引”。他们正向苏联学习，而且将继续向苏联学习怎样为和平、民主、社会主义而斗争，和怎样取得更好的生活之权利。无怪英美帝国主义者要在反苏叫嚣之外，夹杂上一些精神破产的自供了。
    真的，他们有什么可教导人类的呢？残酷剥削的“艺术”么？欺骗和阴谋的“技巧”么？法西斯的统治方法么？贩卖战争么？杜勒斯不是有一次在有一次外长会议席上坦白承认美国代表团说不出“民主”的定义是什么吗？杜勒斯说：“我们觉得这是一件难事，我不认为我们已做得够。”我们如何能期望杜勒斯给“民主”下唯一的正确的定义，因而证明“民主”依照美帝国主义者所了解，是反动和法西斯，是一切的民主的否定呢？
    至于反苏的叫嚣，劳动人民知道得很清楚，这些卑鄙龌龊的反苏谰言是一文不值的。苏联撕毁和平敌人和窒息民主的英美战争贩子及帝国主义阵营的铁托叛徒的假面具。苏联在和平劳动领域上的胜利给劳动群众以新的力量——劳动人民视苏维埃国家为反帝的、民主的阵营的当然领袖。
    著名的中国学者郭沫若说：“中国人民很清楚了解美帝国主义的战争企图……我们中国人相信，如果要保障和平，国际和平运动必须由最可靠的和平堡垒苏联来领导。”
    次特伯雷主教约翰生在莫斯科举行的苏联保卫和平大会上说：“你们是积极的社会主义先锋，也就是和平的先锋。我们很愉快向你们表示，我们多么感谢你们。”
    法国代表，作家拉斐特说：“苏联的人民，我们感谢你们，给了我们新力量来为和平战斗并取得胜利。”
    伟大的苏联正给予人民民主国家以兄弟般的、无私的帮助。它把建立社会主义的丰富的经验宝藏供给这些国家的人民使用。这便是为什么苏联享有如此高度的精神权威与威信。谁也不能动摇它。
