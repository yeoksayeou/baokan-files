(Beijing News) The Jingxi Coal Mine Company convened an enlarged cadre meeting of its affiliated mines to summarize the work since the company's establishment, study and discuss and determine the guiding principles and tasks for production development in 1950, and formulate a production plan. The meeting lasted three days and ended on the 8th of this month. The meeting was attended by: key cadres and engineering technicians from Mentougou, Chengzi, Xishan, Datai, Liangxiang Dongyuji and other coal mines, representatives from the Beijing Coal Mine Trade Union, the Jingxi Mining Bureau, and responsible cadres from the CCP branches and trade unions of each mine, totaling more than 40 people. Mu Zexian, Director of the Municipal Government Industry Bureau, also attended and provided guidance. The meeting was presided over by Gu Jingbo and Feng Peizhi, the company's general and deputy managers, and Gao Zhende, the supervisory committee member. In his report summarizing and reviewing the work, Manager Gu Jingbo pointed out that since the company's establishment on May 10, under the correct leadership of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Industry Bureau, it had overcome floods and ensured the supply of coal for Beijing and Tianjin. Certain achievements had also been made in production, construction, drainage, and worker welfare. Although the Mentougou and Xishan mines were flooded, the annual output of the Mentougou, Chengzi, and Xishan mines can still reach 380,000 tons this year (a decrease of 140,000 tons compared to last year). However, the production enthusiasm and efficiency of the workers have greatly improved, and drainage is being carried out quickly and actively. Output is now increasing daily. Before and after the floods, the company opened three inclined shafts in Xiaoxishan; Chengzi Mine added underground engineering; Datai and Liangxiang built Cangdao and high lines; Mentougou Mine persisted in drainage projects; Xishan Mine supported 57 small kilns with drainage; built 1,005 houses (mainly workers' dormitories); and supported the private kiln Dongyuji to jointly operate with it; fully supplied the necessary equipment for each mine; and appropriately resettled unemployed workers. In reviewing the shortcomings of the work, Manager Gu pointed out: (1) When formulating various work plans, the mass line was not followed, and the plans were formulated only based on the subjective wishes of a few people. When implementing various plans, the masses were not mobilized, so the plans could not be completed on time. (2) The idea of relying on the working class to develop production was not clear, and the unity of the staff and workers was not close. Although the factory management committees of each mine had been established, they were only a formality. (3) The old, unreasonable bureaucratic system was not abolished and reformed in time. (4) The company's leadership lacked a system and specific plans.

After a day and a half of group discussions, the attending cadres carefully studied and spoke enthusiastically. The spirit of democracy was fully developed at the meeting, and finally, various opinions were concentrated, and a conclusion was reached on the guiding principles and tasks for production development in 1950. The meeting specifically decided: (1) Mentougou and Xishan mines should actively drain water and produce coal; Chengzi should quickly continue coal mining projects; water prevention projects in Mentougou, Chengzi, Dayu and surrounding areas should continue. (2) Liangxiang, Datai, and Xiaoxishan will actively prepare for engineering in the first half of next year and produce in large quantities in the second half of the year. Because Liangxiang coalfield has good coal seams and quality and rich reserves, and has a promising future, the focus of engineering in 1950 is set on Liangxiang. (3) The seven mines of Mentougou, Chengzi, Liangxiang, Datai, Xishan, Xiaoxishan, and Dongyuji, etc., plan to produce 807,880 tons of coal in 1950. If the coal kilns are flooded, the coal production can still reach 653,880 tons to supply Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding. In addition, each mine will establish an economic accounting system, formulate production standards and production efficiency, and strive to reduce costs, and clean up warehouses and materials in the next year; streamline and save, and utilize waste materials. In production, employees should closely unite to ensure the completion of tasks. After the meeting, each mine will formulate a specific production plan and submit it to the company for study before the 25th of this month, and then submit it to the Industry Bureau for approval and implementation.

　　京西煤矿公司扩大干部会议
  　计划明年产煤八十万吨
    供应平津保三地用煤
    【北京讯】京西煤矿公司召集所属各矿举行扩大干部会议，总结该公司成立以来的工作，研究讨论并确定了一九五○年发展生产的方针和任务，拟出生产计划。会议历时三天，于本月八日结束。出席会议的有：门头沟、城子、西山、大台、良乡东毓记等煤矿的主要干部、工程技术人员、北京市煤矿工会、京西矿务处及各矿中共支部、工会负责干部共四十余人。市政府工业局牟泽衔局长亦出席指导。会议由该公司正副经理谷静波、冯佩之，监委高振德主持。谷静波经理在总结和检讨工作的报告中指出：公司自五月十日成立迄今，在北京市人民政府工业局正确领导下，战胜水患，保证了京、津两地的燃煤。在生产、建设、排水、工人福利等工作上，也收到了一定成绩。门头沟、城子、西山三矿产量，虽然门头、西山两窑被淹，但今年年产量仍可达三十八万吨（比去年减少十四万吨），而职工生产情绪，生产效率大大提高，迅速积极排水，现在产量正逐日增加。水患前后，公司在小黑山开凿三个斜井；城子矿增设井下工程；大台、良乡修建苍道和高线路；门矿坚持排水工程；西山矿扶植了五十七家小窑排水；修建房屋一千零五间（主要为工人宿舍），并扶植了私窑东毓记与其合营；充分供应了各矿所需的器材；适当地安置了失业工人。谷经理在检讨工作中的缺点时指出：（一）制订各种工作计划时，未走群众路线，只凭少数人主观愿望制订。当执行各种计划时，则又不发动群众，以致计划不能按时完成。（二）依靠工人阶级发展生产的思想不明确，职工团结得不密切，各矿工厂管理委员会虽已成立，但只具形式。（三）未及时废除和改革旧有不合理的官僚制度。（四）公司领导上缺乏制度及具体计划。
    会议经过一天半的分组讨论，出席干部认真研究热烈发言，会上充分发扬了民主精神，最后将各种意见集中，得出一九五○年发展生产的方针和任务的结论。会议具体决定：（一）门头、西山两矿积极排水出煤；城子迅速继续进行采煤工程；门头、城子、大峪一带防水工程要继续进行。（二）良乡、大台、小黑山明年上半年积极作准备工程，下半年大量生产。由于良乡煤田的煤层、煤质好，蕴藏量丰富，前途远大，所以一九五○年工程重点定为良乡。（三）门头、城子、良乡、大台、西山、小黑山、东毓记等七矿，一九五○年计划产煤八十万七千八百八十吨，煤窑如被水淹产煤亦可达六十五万三千八百八十吨，以供应平、津、保三地燃用。此外，各矿在明年度树立经济核算制度，制订生产标准、生产效率，力求减低成本，并清理仓库、物资；精简节约，利用废料。在生产当中，职工密切团结，保证任务完成。各矿于会后，即行拟定生产具体计划，本月二十五日前送公司研究后，呈工业局批准执行。
