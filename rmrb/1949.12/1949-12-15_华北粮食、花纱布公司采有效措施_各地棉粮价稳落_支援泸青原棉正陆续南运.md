　　North China Grain and Cotton Yarn Company Adopts Effective Measures
  　Grain and Cotton Prices Stabilize and Fall in Various Regions
    Raw Cotton Supporting Shanghai and Qingdao is Being Shipped South Continuously
    [Tianjin News] After the North China Grain Company and the North China Cotton Yarn Company took measures to stabilize grain and cotton prices in the entire North China region, prices in urban and rural areas of North China have tended to stabilize, ensuring the lives of the broad masses of people. In November, prices in various parts of North China fluctuated, with grain and cotton rising the fastest. To this end, in addition to organizing the direct supply of grain and yarn in large cities such as Beijing and Tianjin, the North China Grain Company and the North China Cotton Yarn Company jointly instructed their subordinate branches on December 1 to set stable standards for grain and cotton prices in each market based on the local price level at that time, the laws of grain and cotton circulation, quality, grade differences, and surrounding conditions, and to grasp their implementation.
    After receiving the instructions, the branches of the two companies closely cooperated through joint meetings and other methods, and actively contacted local financial and economic departments to study and stipulate grain and cotton price standards. Then, the grain branches vigorously transferred and sold grain, and combined with the cotton collection teams of local cooperatives and cotton yarn branches to directly supply the masses. By December 7, grain and cotton prices in various markets in North China had stabilized and fallen to the expected standards, including Baoding, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Xinxiang, Handan, Langfang, Xushui, Zhuoxian, Xinji, Nangong, Wu'an, Gaoyi, Boye, Gaoyang, Gaocheng, Yuci, Pingyao, Fenyang, Linfen, Anyang, Yuxian, Jiyuan and other major markets. The general price of millet stabilized at 600 yuan per jin, lint cotton was about 4,800 yuan per jin, and seed cotton was 1,700 yuan per jin. The ratio of cotton to millet generally reached more than one to eight.
    However, there are still a few areas such as Dingxian, Yangcun, and Hanyang where cotton prices or grain prices are high, or both cotton and grain prices are high. For this reason, the two companies recently issued a second joint instruction, ordering each branch to continue to implement the price stabilization work, so that the differences between regions will become reasonable, so as to facilitate the exchange of materials.
    [Another News] The large amount of cotton from North China supporting the textile industry in Shanghai and Qingdao in November has been shipped out recently under the close cooperation of the Tianjin Transfer General Depot (formerly the North China Railway Transfer Depot) of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the Cotton Yarn Company. The cotton planned to be shipped to Shanghai in December is now being shipped continuously.

　　华北粮食、花纱布公司采有效措施
  　各地棉粮价稳落
    支援泸青原棉正陆续南运
    【天津讯】华北粮食公司与华北花纱布公司，在华北全区采取了稳定粮食、棉花价格后，已使华北城乡物价趋向稳定，保障了广大人民的生活。十一月份，华北各地物价波动，尤以粮食棉花上涨最快。为此，华北粮食公司与华北花纱布公司除了在京、津等大城市内组织粮食纱布的直接供应外，并于十二月一日联合指示所属各地分支公司，根据当地当时物价水平，棉粮流通规律、质量、等级差别及周围情况，对各市场粮、棉价格，定出稳定标准，掌握执行。
    两公司分支机构接获指示后，通过联席会等方式密切配合，并主动与当地财经部门联系，研究规定粮棉价格标准。然后由粮食分支公司大力调拨出售粮食，并结合各地合作社和花纱布分支公司的收花小组直接供应群众。至十二月七日，华北各市场粮食和棉花价格均已稳落到预期标准，其中包括保定、唐山、石家庄、太原、新乡、邯郸、廊坊、徐水、涿县、辛集、南宫、武安、高邑、博野、高阳、藁城、榆次、平遥、汾阳、临汾、安阳、盂县、济源等主要市场，一般小米价每斤稳落到六百元，皮棉每斤约四千八百元，籽棉每斤一千七百元，棉花与小米比价一般达到一比八以上。
    但目前仍有少数地区如定县、杨村、汉阳等地有棉价或粮价较高，或棉粮均高的情况，为此该两公司最近又发出第二次联合指示，饬各分支公司继续贯彻稳价工作，使地区间差额走向合理，以利物资交流。
    【又讯】十一月份华北支援上海青岛两地纺织工业的大量棉花，在中央人民政府贸易部天津转运总栈（原华北铁路转运栈）与花纱布公司密切结合下，已于日前运完。十二月份计划运上海的棉花现正继续起运中。
