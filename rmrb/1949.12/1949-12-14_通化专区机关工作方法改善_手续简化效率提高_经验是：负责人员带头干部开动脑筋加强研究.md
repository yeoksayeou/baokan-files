　　【Our Newspaper's News】The Party and government organs in the Tonghua Special District of Liaodong Province have recently been actively improving their working methods. The leading personnel of the prefectural committee and the administrative office all went to Zhian Village in Tonghua County to absorb the experience of the village people's congress pilot program, and the cooperative general agency also went to the countryside to pilot village cooperatives. The Deputy Director and Party Secretary of the Forestry Bureau, and others, also went to the work areas to provide specific guidance, in order to better complete this year's logging tasks. The main responsible persons of organs such as the Public Security Branch, the Trade Union, and the Mining Bureau, have all gone deep into the rural areas or mines to experiment, discover problems, and provide guidance. The demonstrative role of leading cadres has greatly influenced ordinary cadres. All organs are on time for work and have changed the lax phenomenon of not separating dormitories from offices. Some units have formulated weekly or daily work plans. In the past, the Electrical Industry Bureau's Engineering Section only had a few section chiefs discuss research work. Now, workers are included, and everyone uses their brains, strengthening leadership. The improvement of the auditing work of the Administrative Office's Finance Section is the most significant. In the past, it took three or four days per county to audit the final accounts of thirteen counties (cities) each month. After research and scientific division of labor, it now takes only two or two and a half days to approve one county's accounts, saving nearly half the time compared to before. Wang Huanbi of the Secretariat improved the file archiving method, saving public expenditure; he also completed a month's work in four and a half days. The administrative office organs are preparing to give spiritual and material rewards.

　　通化专区机关工作方法改善
  　手续简化效率提高
    经验是：负责人员带头干部开动脑筋加强研究
    【本报讯】辽东省通化专区的党政机关近积极改进工作方法。地委、专署负责人员均到通化县治安村，吸取该村试行村人民代表大会经验，合作总社也下乡试办村合作社。林务局副局长、党委书记等，亦到作业地区，进行具体指导，以便更好地完成今年的采伐任务。公安分处、工会、矿务局等机关的主要负责人，都深入到农村或矿山实验，发现问题，进行指导。领导干部的示范作用，大大影响了一般干部。各机关按时办公，并改变了宿舍办公室不分的松懈现象。有的单位制订了一周工作计划或每日计划。电业局工务科，过去研究工作只有几个股长商量一下，现在则吸收工友参加，大家用脑子，加强了领导。专署财政科审计工作的改进最为显著，过去每月审核十三个县（市）的决算，每县需三、四日，经过研究，科学分工，现在两天或两天半即可批完一个县的，较前节省时间几达一半。秘书处王焕陛改进了文件的归案法，节省了公家的开支；他并以四天半的时间完成了过去一个月的工作。专署机关正准备给以精神物质的奖励。
