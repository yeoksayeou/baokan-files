Everyone Should Study "A Short Biography of Stalin"
	Wang Ziye

In these days celebrating the seventieth birthday of Marshal Stalin, I suggest that everyone study "A Short Biography of Stalin."

"A Short Biography of Stalin" was published by the Soviet Marx, Engels, and Lenin Institute more than a decade ago. In 1947, the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House revised and supplemented it, making it the most popular new version today. The new version supplements materials from around the time of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, and other chapters have also been revised to some extent. The editors are: Alexandrov, Galaktionov, Krushkov, Mitin, Motsalov, and Pospelov.

When this book was published in the Soviet Union, the initial print run was as high as one million copies. The publication of the new edition of "A Short Biography of Stalin" is not only a major event in the social and political life of the Soviet Union, but also warmly welcomed by the working people of the world.

At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, Russia experienced a great people's revolution, led by Lenin and Stalin. Lenin and Stalin were the new leaders of the new masses, the founders of the Bolshevik Party, the founders of the Soviet state, and the founders of the building of a communist society.

The lives and careers of Lenin and Stalin are inseparable from the half-century history of the Bolshevik Party, from the history of the revolution, and from the history of the Soviet state and the Soviet people.

In the biographies of Lenin and Stalin, we can obtain the rich experience of the Bolshevik Party, the source of understanding Marxism-Leninism, and the great and vivid example of serving the people with unlimited loyalty.

The pages of Lenin's and Stalin's biographies unfold before us the full picture of the leaders of the new era, who from a young age devoted themselves with unlimited loyalty to the people and to the cause of communism.

For those who are advancing along the road indicated by Leninism, the biographies of Lenin and Stalin are the key to understanding the experience of Bolshevik struggle and victory, and a source of inspiration for labor and struggle.

Studying the biographies of Lenin and Stalin is an important means of receiving communist education. We should start our Marxist education by studying the biographies of Lenin and Stalin. This is a shortcut to understanding and mastering Leninism, and it is easier to study the collections of Lenin and Stalin later.

Comrade Stalin—Lenin's loyal comrade-in-arms and the great successor to his immortal cause—'s biography illustrates the close and inseparable ideological connection between Lenin and Stalin in all stages of the struggle for the Party, for the cause of the revolution, and for the cause of the working people. Comrade Stalin's biography depicts the scale of the great cause of transforming the country and the people that Stalin has undertaken.

Stalin's name is loved by all the people of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet people regard Stalin as the embodiment of heroism and loyalty to the motherland. Because of Stalin's name, the Soviet people transformed the country; because of Stalin's name, the glorious Soviet Red Army defeated the enemy; because of Stalin's name, millions of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals worked selflessly and diligently during the war, contributing everything to the front and to victory; because of Stalin's name, the Soviet people are struggling to realize the new Five-Year Plan and successfully restore the wounds brought about by the war.

Stalin's name is deeply imprinted in the heart of every Soviet citizen. The most sublime aspiration of Soviet youth is to be a Lenin-Stalin-type politician.

The younger generation of the Soviet people all regard Stalin as their great teacher, loving father, and good friend.

The best qualities of the Bolsheviks embodied in Lenin and Stalin are: a spirit of fearlessness, a broad vision, an iron, unyielding will that can overcome everything, revolutionary enthusiasm, unlimited confidence in the creativity of the people, great organizational genius, clarity and firmness, truthfulness and loyalty, knowing no fear in the struggle, unlimited love for the people, hatred for the enemy, not losing reason in times of danger and difficulty, and not being overwhelmed by victory.

Studying Comrade Stalin's biography makes us more confident in the victory of Lenin and Stalin's immortal cause and more confident in the victory of the communist cause.

Stalin is the genius leader and teacher of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the great strategist of the socialist revolution, and the leader and wise commander of the Soviet state. He is merciless towards the enemies of socialism, has an extremely profound spirit of principle, and in his work, he has a clear revolutionary future and purpose, as well as a strong will to not stop until the goal is achieved; he has wise and concrete leadership; and he has an inseparable connection with the masses. These are the characteristics of Stalin's work style.

Stalin's entire activity shows that he has both great theoretical strength and exceptionally broad and magnificent practical revolutionary struggle experience.

Together with his close comrades-in-arms, and led by the great Bolshevik Party, Stalin leads an unprecedented multi-ethnic socialist state of workers and peasants. His instructions are the guide to action for all departments of socialist construction. Comrade Stalin's work is exceptionally broad; his energy is amazingly strong. The problems that Stalin is concerned with encompass everything: from the most complex issues of Marxism-Leninism to the compilation of children's textbooks; from dealing with Soviet foreign policy issues to daily attention to the construction of the proletarian capital; from the establishment of the Northern Sea Route to the dehumidification project of the Colchis lowland; from the development of Soviet literature and art to the revision of the collective farm life regulations, and finally to solving the most complex theoretical and practical problems of military art.

Stalin has an indestructible logical power, his mind is as clear as crystal, and his will is as strong as steel. Everyone knows that he is infinitely loyal to the Party, has deep confidence in the people, and is enthusiastic about protecting them. He is humble and frank, considerate of people, and merciless towards the enemies of the people. He opposes exaggeration, opposes empty talk, opposes empty words, opposes retreating in the face of difficulties, and opposes being flustered when things happen. Whenever Stalin encounters complex political problems that need to be carefully estimated, he is always wise, calm, and not impatient. And Stalin is also extremely good at planning bold revolutionary methods and implementing rapid transformation steps.

Stalin is the loyal successor to Lenin's cause, and it can also be said that Stalin is Lenin today.

Comrade Stalin's life and career are inseparable from the international workers' movement and the anti-imperialist national liberation struggles of the people in the colonies.

Millions of workers in countries around the world recognize Stalin as their teacher, because they have learned from Stalin's typical works in the past and present how to defeat class enemies and how to prepare the conditions for the final victory of the proletariat. Stalin's influence is also the influence of the glorious and great Bolshevik Party, because workers in capitalist countries recognize this party as a model working-class party to be emulated. Under the leadership of this party, not only was the capitalist system overthrown, and not only was the Soviet regime, that is, the labor regime, established, but a socialist society has already been built in the Soviet Union.

Workers in countries around the world know that every word of Stalin represents the Soviet people and that what is said will be done. The working masses of countries around the world, based on the facts of the victory of the Soviet socialist revolution, the success of Soviet socialist construction, and the victory of the Soviet people's Great Patriotic War, have realized that Lenin and Stalin's cause is extremely correct and in line with reality. Now all freedom-loving nations recognize Stalin as a loyal and determined defender of peace, security, and democratic freedom.

The end of this book quotes Molotov's words: "We are fortunate that in the difficult years of the war, we had the wise and experienced Great Stalin of our Soviet Union to guide the Red Army and the Soviet people forward. The glorious victory of our army will be recorded in the history of our country and the world together with the name of Marshal Stalin. Now, under the leadership of the great leader and organizer Stalin, we have embarked on peaceful construction in order to bring the socialist society to its peak and not to disappoint all the friends in the world who have high hopes for us."

　　人人都应学习“斯大林传略”
    王子野
    在庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰的时日，我建议大家都来学习“斯大林传略”。
    “斯大林传略”苏联马、恩、列学院十几年前曾出过一个本子，一九四七年苏联国立政治书籍出版局重新修订、补充，成为现在最流行的新版本，新版本补充了苏联伟大的卫国战争前后时期的材料，其余的各章节也有某些修正。编著者是：亚历山大洛夫，迦拉克季奥诺夫，克鲁什可夫，米丁，莫察洛夫，波斯彼洛夫。
    这部书在苏联出版时第一次印行数即达一百万册之巨。新版“斯大林传略”的出版不仅是苏联国家社会政治生活上的一件大事，而且也受到全世界劳动人民的热烈欢迎。
    　　　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    十九世纪和二十世纪之交，俄国爆发了一次伟大的人民的革命，它是列宁和斯大林领导的。列宁和斯大林乃是新群众的新领袖，是布尔什维克党的首创者，是苏维埃国家的建立者，是建立共产主义社会的奠基人。
    列宁和斯大林的生平和事业与布尔什维克党半个世纪的历史是分不开的，与革命的历史是分不开的，与苏联国家和苏联人民的历史是分不开的。
    在列宁斯大林的传记中，我们可以获得布尔什维克党的丰富经验，可以获得认识马克思主义列宁主义的泉源，可以获得无限忠诚地服务于人民的伟大而生动的范例。
    列宁和斯大林传记的篇页在我们面前展开了新时代的领袖的全貌，他们从年轻时起就无限忠诚地献身于人民，献身于共产主义的事业。
    对于沿着列宁主义所指示的道路前进的人们，列宁和斯大林的传记乃是认识布尔什维克斗争和胜利的经验的锁钥，是鼓舞劳动和斗争的泉源。
    研究列宁和斯大林的传记是接受共产主义教育的重要手段。我们开始学习马克思主义的教育最好从研究列宁和斯大林的传记入手。这是认识和掌握列宁主义的捷径而便于往后研究列宁和斯大林的文集。
    斯大林同志——列宁的忠实战友和他的不朽事业的伟大继承者——的传记说明列宁和斯大林在为党、为革命事业、为劳动人民的事业而斗争的一切阶段上有着密切不可分的思想联系，斯大林同志的传记给我们描绘出斯大林所作的改造国家和人民的伟大事业的规模。
    斯大林的名字为苏联全体人民所热爱着，苏联人民认为斯大林是英雄主义和忠实于祖国的化身。因为斯大林的名字，苏联的人民改造了国家；因为斯大林的名字，光荣的苏联红军战胜了敌人；因为斯大林的名字，千百万的工人、集体农民、知识分子在战时曾忘我地辛勤劳作，把一切贡献给前线，贡献给胜利；因为斯大林的名字，苏联人民为新五年计划的实现而斗争，顺利地恢复了战争所带来的创伤。
    斯大林的名字深印在苏联每一个公民的心中。苏联青年的最崇高的想望是作一个列宁——斯大林型的政治家。
    苏联人民的年青一代都把斯大林看作是自己的伟大的导师、慈父和良友。
    在列宁和斯大林身上所体现出来的布尔什维克的最优良的品质是：大无畏的精神、远大的眼光、铁的、不屈服的、足以克服一切的意志、革命的热情、对人民创造力的无限的信心、伟大的组织天才、明确和坚定、真实和忠诚、在斗争中不知道恐惧、对于人民无限的爱、对敌人的仇恨、在危险和困难的时机不失去理智、胜利时不冲昏头脑。
    研究斯大林同志的传记使我们对列宁斯大林的不朽事业的胜利更具信心，对共产主义事业的胜利更具信心。
    ×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    斯大林是联共党的天才领袖和导师，是社会主义革命的伟大战略家，是苏维埃国家的领导者和英明统帅。对社会主义敌人毫不留情，极深刻的原则精神，在工作中，既有明确的革命前途和目的，又有非达到目的不止的坚强意志；英明而具体的领导；同群众有不可分的联系，这就是斯大林的工作作风的特点。
    斯大林的全部活动表明他既有极大的理论力量，又有异常广阔宏伟的实际革命斗争经验。
    同自己的亲密战友在一起，以伟大的布尔什维克党为首，斯大林领导着史无前例的多民族的工农社会主义国家。他的指示是社会主义建设事业各个部门的行动指南。斯大林同志的工作异常阔广；他的精力之强令人惊异。斯大林所关怀的问题无所不包：从最复杂的马克思主义列宁主义问题直到编订儿童教科书；从处理苏联对外政策问题直到日常关注无产阶级首都的建设事宜；从建立北方海上航路问题直到柯尔希达低原除湿工程；从苏联文学艺术发展问题直到校订集体农场生活章程，最后还要解决军事艺术上最复杂的理论和实践问题。
    斯大林具有无坚不摧的逻辑力量，他的头脑如水晶般明亮，他的意志如钢铁般坚强。大家都知道他对党无限忠实，对人民深具信心，热烈爱护，他谦虚坦白，对人体贴入微，对人民公敌毫不留情，他反对夸张，反对清谈，反对空话，反对见难而退，反对遇事张惶。斯大林每遇解决复杂政治问题需要周密估计利弊所在的时候，总是明哲镇定，毫不急躁。并且斯大林又是极其善于规划大胆的革命办法和实行争遽转变步骤的能手。
    斯大林是列宁事业的忠实继承者，也可以说斯大林就是今天的列宁。
    斯大林同志的生平与事业与国际工人运动以及各殖民地人民反帝民族解放斗争是分不开的。
    世界各国千百万工人，认定斯大林是他们的导师，因为他们过去和现在，都从斯大林的典型著作中学习怎样战胜阶级敌人，学习怎样准备无产阶级最终胜利的条件。斯大林的影响，也就是光荣伟大布尔什维克党的影响，因为资本主义各国工人，认定这个党是可供效法的工人阶级模范政党。在这个党的领导下，不但推翻了资本主义制度，不但建立了苏维埃政权，即劳动政权，而且已经在苏联建成了社会主义社会。
    世界各国工人知道，斯大林的每一句话都是代表苏联人民说出来的，都是说了就要做的。世界各国劳动群众，根据苏联社会主义革命胜利，苏联社会主义建设成功，苏联人民伟大卫国战争胜利完成的事实，已经领会了列宁、斯大林事业万分正确，合乎实际。现在所有爱好自由的民族，都认定斯大林是忠诚坚决保卫和平、安全及民主自由的。
    这部书的结尾引用了莫洛托的话：“我们幸运的地方，就是在艰苦的战争年代，有我们苏联的英明谙练的伟大斯大林引导红军和苏联人民前进。我们军队的光荣胜利，将与斯大林元帅的名字连在一起载入我国和全世界的史册。现在，我们在伟大的领袖和组织者斯大林领导之下，已经着手进行和平建设，以期社会主义社会臻于极盛境地，而不辜负全世界所有一切友人对我们的厚望。”（本文根据一九四七年二月七日“少共真理报”专论改写）
