　　Long Live Marshal Stalin
    Ma Xulun
    Today, the entire Chinese people, with unparalleled warmth and excitement, celebrate the 70th birthday of the great world revolutionary leader, Marshal Stalin. This is because Marshal Stalin and the Soviet people he leads have provided the Chinese people with various unforgettable forms of assistance. This assistance has encouraged the Chinese people's confidence in the victory of the revolution; this assistance has accelerated the victorious success of the Chinese people's great revolution, and this assistance will further enable our New Democratic nation to be built up quickly. The Chinese people will soon obtain a happy and fulfilling life. The enthusiastic celebration of Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday by the entire Chinese people is by no means accidental.
    Marshal Stalin not only guided the Soviet people to liberation, and guided the Soviet people to create and build a happy socialist country, he also wants to help the people of the whole world to seek liberation, and to create and build their own happy countries. He is not only the teacher and friend of the Soviet people, but also the teacher and friend of the people of the whole world. Therefore, it is by no means accidental that the people of the whole world so enthusiastically celebrate his 70th birthday today.
    The enthusiastic celebration of Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday by the entire Chinese people and the people of the world precisely demonstrates the determination of the entire Chinese people and even the people of the world to firmly support the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. Even though the remnant forces of imperialism are still frantically preparing for a new war, the people of the world will surely be able to unite under the wise leadership of Marshal Stalin, smash the conspiracies of imperialism, and strive for the lasting peace of all mankind.
    Long live the great world revolutionary teacher, Marshal Stalin!
