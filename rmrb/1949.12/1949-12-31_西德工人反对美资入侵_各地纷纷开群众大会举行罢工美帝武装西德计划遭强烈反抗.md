Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th—The large-scale incursion of American monopoly capital into West German industry has sparked a wave of angry protests from West German workers.

Since late last month, workers in Düsseldorf, Ratingen, Oberhausen (all in the British occupation zone), Nuremberg and Stuttgart (all in the American occupation zone) have successively held mass protest meetings. Workers in Dortmund, Hanover (both in the British occupation zone) and Frankfurt (American occupation zone) have also held protest strikes, passing resolutions opposing the intrusion of American capital into West Germany and the treasonous actions of the Bonn "government" in actively implementing American aggressive plans.

According to a DPA Frankfurt dispatch: preparations for implementing the plan for American capital's incursion into West Germany have entered a decisive stage. Ten members of the US Congressional Committee on Banks and Currency arrived in Frankfurt earlier this month to conduct final negotiations on US investment in West German industry. As revealed by TASS: during the negotiations, the representatives of American bankers put forward investment conditions that included enjoying unlimited privileges and earning huge profits. At the same time, the American side demanded a decisive influence in the management of enterprises receiving its loans, as a major condition for the loans. To this end, Adenauer has proposed increasing the capital of the largest German steel concern, "United Steel Works," from the current 460 million marks to 875 million marks, with foreign capital (mainly American capital) accounting for 30 percent of the total and enjoying veto power on the board of directors. At the same time, West German bankers and industrialists are following the wishes of American monopoly capitalists and planning to establish a German-American bank with a capital of 20 million US dollars, and have appointed Hjalmar Schacht, the former head of the Reichsbank of Hitler's Germany and a war criminal, as the German representative.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 27th—The Western imperialist bloc's conspiracy to arm West Germany is being strongly resisted by the German people. Max Reimann, Chairman of the Communist Party of Germany (West Germany), recently strongly criticized the imperialist bloc's military build-up plan in the West German "Federal Parliament," denouncing the West German "Federal Government" as "a puppet government receiving wages from American imperialism," and impeached Adenauer. At a rally in Schwenningen on the 18th, Reimann also called on German youth to refuse to participate in new military service.

According to a TASS Berlin dispatch: Members of the Industrial Council, representing 97,000 workers, met in Nuremberg and resolved that all trade unions should use all means to oppose the military build-up in West Germany. The Student Committee of the Allerget Higher Technical School and other youth organizations also expressed serious protests against the remilitarization of West Germany. According to Dentsu: The "League of Those Persecuted by the Nazis" protested against the military build-up in West Germany, pointing out that "this is a violation of the Potsdam Agreement and another serious step towards a new imperialist war." The Brandenburg Democratic Women's League also protested to Adenauer, saying, "We German mothers want our children to live," and demanded the establishment of friendly relations with peaceful and democratic countries headed by the powerful Soviet Union. Democratic newspapers reminded the people about the upcoming establishment of an 110,000-strong mercenary army, saying that when Hitler forcibly imposed military service in 1935, Goebbels' newspapers announced that a core of Nazi troops would be formed with 100,000 people. The Berliner Zeitung quoted US Congressman Paulge's assurance to American youth that they could stay at home during the next war because the United States could hire foreign troops in Europe with less money, thereby increasing the vigilance of the West German people.

　　西德工人反对美资入侵
　  各地纷纷开群众大会举行罢工美帝武装西德计划遭强烈反抗
    【新华社北京二十九日电】美国垄断资本的大举侵入西德工业已激起西德工人抗议的怒潮。
    自上月下旬以来，杜塞尔多夫、莱德特、奥勃霍森（以上英占区）、纽伦堡和斯图加特（以上美占区）等地的工人，曾先后召开群众性抗议大会。多特蒙德、汉诺威（以上英占区）和法兰克福（美占区）等地的工人，又先后举行抗议性罢工，通过决议，反对美国资本侵入西德与波恩“政府”积极执行美国侵略计划的卖国行为。
    据德意志通讯社法兰克福消息：关于实行美国资本侵入西德计划的筹备工作，已进入决定性阶段。美国国会所属银行与货币委员会委员十人，早于本月初到达法兰克福，对美国投资西德工业一事，进行最后谈判。据塔斯社揭露：在谈判中，美银行家代表提出享有无限特权与赚取厚利的投资条件。同时，美方要求在接受其贷款的企业管理中起决定性影响，作为贷款的主要条件。为此阿登纳建议将德国最大的钢铁康采恩——“联合钢厂”的资本，自目前的四亿六千万马克增至八亿七千五百万马克，而外国资本（主要是美资）可占总额的百分之三十，并在董事会中享有否决权。与此同时，西德银行家与工业家正遵奉美国垄断资本家的意旨，拟设一德美银行，资金为二千万美元，并任命前希特勒德国的帝国银行行长、战犯沙赫特为德方代表。
    【新华社北京二十七日电】西方帝国主义集团武装西德的阴谋活动，正遭到德国人民的强烈反抗。德国共产党（西德）主席雷曼最近在西德“联邦议会”上，猛烈抨击帝国主义集团的建军计划，斥责西德“联邦政府”是“领取美国帝国主义工钱的傀儡政府”，并对阿登纳提出弹劾。十八日在施文尼根的一个集会上，雷曼又号召德国青年拒绝参加新的军事服役。
    据塔斯社柏林讯：代表九万七千工人的工业的理事会会员曾在纽约伦堡开会，决议各工会采用一切方法反对在西德建军。阿勒格脱高级技术学校学生委员会和其他青年组织对西德重新军国主义化亦提出严重抗议。另据电通社讯：“遭纳粹迫害者同盟”抗议在西德建军，指出“这是违反波茨坦协定与走向新帝国主义战争的又一严重步骤”。勃兰登堡民主妇女联盟也向阿登纳提出抗议称：“我们德国的母亲们要我们的孩子活下去”，并要求与以强大苏联为首的和平民主国家建立友好关系，民主报纸对即将建立的十一万雇佣军队一事提醒人民称：一九三五年希特勒强迫军事服役时，戈培尔的报纸曾宣布以十万人组成纳粹军队的核心。柏林日报则引录美国国会议员鲍治向美国青年所提的保证，即在下次大战时，他们可以留在国内，因为美国可以用较少的金钱在欧洲雇到外国军队，以提高西德人民的警惕。
