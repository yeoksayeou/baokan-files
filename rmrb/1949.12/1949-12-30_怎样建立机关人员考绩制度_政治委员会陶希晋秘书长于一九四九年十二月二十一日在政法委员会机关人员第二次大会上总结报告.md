Establishing a Performance Appraisal System for Government Employees

　　Summary Report by Tao Xijin, Secretary-General of the Political Committee, at the Second General Meeting of Government Employees of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee on December 21, 1949

　　When the North China People's Government concluded its work, it originally planned to conduct a performance appraisal, but it failed to do so due to insufficient preparation. This was a shortcoming in the concluding work of the North China People's Government. When the Political and Legal Affairs Committee was established, Vice Premier Dong Biwu mentioned this issue, pointing out that there should be a system for cadre performance appraisal, and there should not be unclear rewards and punishments, or a situation where there are punishments but no rewards.

　　The Performance Appraisal System
　  Is a Basic Method in the Leadership Work of Government Agencies

　　The General Office and Personnel Department of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee, after more than a month of deliberation, discussion, and review, finally, through the evaluation committee and leadership approval, determined that seventeen comrades in this agency should receive commendations and rewards. At the same time, one driver comrade was punished, and several other working comrades were criticized for not being responsible enough in their work. The seventeen comrades who received awards were mostly those who had been tested in their work during the North China People's Government, and half of them were personnel from the newly liberated areas. We have piloted this performance appraisal and gained initial experience, which has created a basic method for the leadership work of government agencies in the future. From now on, we must establish a regular and universal performance appraisal system for our government employees. Based on this experience, we will gradually enrich and improve it, and promote it to all subordinate ministries and commissions. The purpose is to promote work, improve administrative efficiency, enable us to work better under the new conditions, and thereby train our new national workers to be more capable of serving the people.

　　How to establish a performance appraisal system for our government employees? The initial experience includes the following four points:

　　Performance Appraisal Must Have a Focus
　  The Purpose is to Give Everyone a Direction for Effort

　　First, our performance appraisal should have a focus so that everyone has a direction for effort, and the system will be easy to define, grasp, and implement. After this period of review, there is a phenomenon of inertia, apathy, and lack of vigor in the ideology and work style of our government employees.

　　(1) Not using their brains, lacking initiative in their work, only doing what they are told to do, failing to take responsibility for their division of labor, not doing anything without a budget, and just drafting whatever instructions they receive. They do not think for themselves, do not seek to overcome difficulties, and reduce us to mediocre civil servants. This problem comes from the bureaucratic government of the old society. On the other hand, it is due to the influence of the bad work style of some problematic comrades in our past political work.

　　(2) Sticking to old ways, staying in small circles, empiricism, and having no sense of the new environment, new tasks, and new working conditions, and therefore unable to unleash creativity. This was most evident at the beginning of the establishment of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee. In general, the various divisions and offices mechanically applied the old set of working methods of the Secretariat of the North China People's Government. Although there has been some correction during recent studies, some have not yet been freed from small circles. This evaluation is a clear example. Some comrades are limited by an old circle in how they view people and things, and they adopt the old way of making appraisals as a form of evaluation, and they often resist the establishment of a new system. Veteran and new cadres have certain knowledge and experience, and they should exchange ideas with each other, but they do not seem to be very harmonious. The small circles have not been opened up, mainly because of empiricism, and empiricism often leads to sectarianism. Therefore, in this study, we asked everyone to first focus on ideological methods, and we asked each division and section to arrange their own business and handle problems from the perspective of objective analysis and investigation and research.

　　(3) Egalitarianism. This reflects the ideological style of the scattered small producers in the countryside. They do not know the focus of their work every day and every week, they like to proceed step by step, and the arrangements for work are often flat and straightforward, and the establishment of institutions is very stable. A few comrades have a tendency toward liberalism, and they take a lenient attitude toward the phenomenon of freedom and looseness in government agencies.

　　(4) "Whether you work or not, it's the same pay," and "reforming the stove takes five or ten years." This is also an expression of inertia and apathy. The years of revolution and work history should be valued, but this is by no means the main thing. The main thing should be morality and talent, and then seniority. The comrades in the administrative office are right to say: this time we are not "evaluating ranks" but "evaluating performance." Of course, the original supply and treatment system of the government agency also has some unreasonable aspects, so our rewards and punishments for performance appraisal cannot be too rigid. Modifications must be made within the scope of possibility.

　　(5) A hired hand mentality. This is something that reflects the oppression of laborers and civil servants by landlords, rich peasants, capitalists, and the bureaucratic governments of the old society. Now all of our government employees are one of the masters of the country and are revolutionary employees, so they should no longer have this view. Do not do only as much work as you are paid for, do not be afraid that you will be fired tomorrow, and do not work with the intention of showing it to your superiors instead of serving the people. Our attendance and performance appraisal are definitely not based on this attitude.

　　Performance Appraisal Standards
　  Mainly Look at Whether There is a Contribution to the People and the Size of the Contribution

　　In short, the focus of our performance appraisal this time is to overcome the above-mentioned adverse phenomena. Therefore, the criteria for performance appraisal mainly depend on whether there is a contribution to the people. That is, we must first look at whether there is creativity, whether they can master the business, and be proficient in the business. We must see whether they can overcome difficulties and complete tasks. We must see whether they have a selfless work attitude and a spirit of collectivism, helping others and promoting others. We must see whether they can be as diligent and thrifty as one person doing the work of two and one penny doing the work of two pennies. Anyone who has the above should be rewarded.

　　Proceeding step by step and sticking to old ways may be a good employee in the old government, but they will not be commended here, because they have not made any contribution to the people, and therefore the people do not need to give them extra remuneration and rewards.

　　A significant issue in this performance appraisal is that the work achievements of the seventeen comrades who received awards are inseparable from their political development and progress in some aspects of their ideological methods. For example, Wu Ying's meticulousness and initiative in establishing personnel archives; telephone operator Du Huiqing's ability to be called a "telephone book"; Zhang Bao's delivery of letters despite wind and rain, learning to ride and repair bicycles, with significant savings; Wang Chouzi's diligence and cleanliness in managing six rooms alone; Teng Lingge's training of three apprentices to learn typing, self-repairing machines, and saving expenses. Their achievements are inseparable from a certain degree of progress in their thinking. If politics is not developed, and if the ideological method is not correct, then it is impossible to create. The so-called undeveloped politics means that one is insensitive to new things, does not study the people's cause, cannot jump out of small circles, and cannot complete tasks in overcoming difficulties.

　　Performance Appraisal Principles Include Rewards and Punishments
　　Second, our performance appraisal system is a specific work review and the establishment of a clear reward and punishment system. The principle is: rewards and punishments, educating everyone, with rewards as the main focus, encouraging progress. Rewards indicate the direction of our progress, and punishments urge us to move forward.

　　The seventeen comrades who received awards this time certainly have many shortcomings, but it is only said that they have played a leading role in some aspects. This is about the matter, not about the person. The development of our cause is endless. What is a model today may not be anything in the future. If today's model does not continue to progress, it may become backward tomorrow. Therefore, those who receive awards should not be proud, but should continue to work hard. Those who have not received awards should not be unhappy, but should strive to learn from the models. Our goal is for everyone to move forward.

　　Secondly, the rewards and punishments of government agencies cannot only be spiritual. In addition to material rewards this time, several people have been promoted, several have had their supply and treatment and salaries changed, those who are not qualified have been demoted, and those who are capable have been promoted. By doing so, we are benefiting the people. It is beneficial to initially break the ideas of "whether you work or not, it's the same pay" and "reforming the stove takes five or ten years."

　　Performance Appraisal Methods
　  Combine Administrative Leadership with Democratic Evaluation

　　Third, our performance appraisal is carried out by combining administrative leadership with democratic evaluation. That is to say, it is not just a way of evaluation by the masses, because that can easily lead to only looking at the surface and burying talent. Government agencies are different from mass organizations. They have a certain leadership relationship, they have a division of labor and responsibility system, and they have different tasks. Work achievements are sometimes not easy for everyone to understand. At the same time, the system in government agencies is the head system. Although we must also follow the mass line in our work, it is not the same as in mass organizations. Therefore, the performance appraisal of government employees needs to be grasped by leaders at all levels, and combined with democratic evaluation, the purpose is to improve work and educate everyone.

　　The Performance Appraisal System Should Be Regular

　　Fourth, our performance appraisal should be regular. In the future, it should be done universally once a year or every six months. Because we are just starting out, we may first do it next spring when the work plan is completed. However, personnel assessment is a regular job, so we must establish and improve the leave system, work log system, and assessment registration system. We cannot rely solely on impressions and bury merit.

　　If everyone agrees with the above four points of initial experience summary after discussion, then specific assessment regulations should be formulated for formal implementation next year.

　　Vice Chairman Peng Zhen recently instructed us that in the current difficult time for cadres, one person should do the work of several people, train apprentices, and be a "little teacher." We must improve ourselves and train cadres with an attitude of tirelessly learning and not being weary. Secondly, we must launch business studies and investigation and research work in order to start developing the business work of our departments. The spirit of our performance appraisal this time is consistent, and everyone should accept Comrade Peng Zhen's call and implement it specifically.

　　Today coincides with the 70th birthday of the world's revolutionary leader Comrade Stalin. Vice Chairman Peng Zemin gave awards and gave us a lot of encouragement and instructions. On this memorable day, it is a milestone in our efforts to promote work and improve ourselves. Those who receive awards are glorious, and those who do not receive awards are also glorious, because glory belongs to the people, and it belongs to the unity and concerted efforts of the comrades.

　　怎样建立机关人员考绩制度
    政治委员会陶希晋秘书长于一九四九年十二月二十一日在政法委员会机关人员第二次大会上总结报告
    华北人民政府结束时，原打算办一次考绩，因准备不够，未能做到，这是华北人民政府结束工作的一个缺点。政法委员会成立时，董必武副总理曾提到这一问题，指出对干部考绩须有定制，不应有赏罚不明和有罚无赏的现象。
    考绩制度
　  是机关领导工作上的一个基本方法
    政法委员会办公厅和人事处这次经过一个多月的酝酿、讨论和检查，最后经过评议委员会和领导上核定了本机关十七位同志应受到表扬和奖励，同时处罚了一位司机同志，并批评了另外数位工作同志，因他们对工作不够负责。这受奖的十七位同志，大多数是华北人民政府时在工作上已有些考验的，其中半数是新解放区来的人员。我们试办了这次考绩，取得初步经验，这就开创了今后机关领导工作上的一个基本方法。我们从此要建立我们机关人员经常的普遍的考绩制度，以这一次的经验，逐渐充实完备起来，并推广到所属各部会去。其目的就是为了推进工作，提高行政效率，使我们在新的条件下，工作得更好，并因之锻炼我们这批新的国家工作人员，使更有能力为人民服务。
    怎样建立我们机关人员的考绩制度？初步经验有以下四点：
    考绩须有重点
　  目的在于给大家一个努力方向
    第一、我们考绩应有重点，使大家有努力方向，制度也就易规定和掌握执行。经过这一时期的检查，我们机关人员的思想作风和工作作风上，是存在着一种因循、疲塌、缺乏朝气的现象。
    （一）不用脑筋，工作上缺乏主动性，上面说啥才做啥，分工不负责，无预算不办事，批示什么就干什么稿，自己不想主意，有困难不求克服，把我们降低为庸俗的公务人员。这毛病是旧社会官僚政府来的，另一方面是由于我们过去政权工作中一部有毛病的同志的坏作风的影响。
    （二）墨守成规，走小圈子，经验主义，对新环境新任务和新工作条件，毫无感觉，因之发挥不出创造性。政法委员会成立之初，表现得最明显。各处室办事，一般是机械运用华北人民政府秘书书厅的老一套工作方法，最近学习中虽有纠正，但还有一些未从小圈子中解放出来，这次评议考绩便是一个明显例子，有些同志囿于一种老圈子看人看事，办考绩沿用通常作鉴定方式的老一套，对一种新制度的建立常是有抵抗的。新老干部互有一定的知识经验，应当相互交流，但还不很融洽似的。小圈子没打开，主要是经验主义作崇，而经验主义必又往往产生宗派主义。所以这次布置的学习，我们要求先搞思想方法，要求各处室科从客观分析和调查研究来布置自己业务和处理问题。
    （三）平均主义思想。这反映了农村散漫的小生产者的思想作风，不知道每日每周自己的工作重点，喜欢按步就班，布置工作常是平铺直叙，建立机构则是四平八稳，少数同志自由主义的倾向，对政府机关中的自由散漫现象采迁就态度。
    （四）“干不干，二斤半”“五年十年改灶”，这也是因循、疲塌的思想表现。革命年限和工作历史是应该被重视的，但这决不是主要的，主要的应该是德、才，其次才是资。行政处同志提得对：这次我们不是“考级”而是“考绩”。当然，机关原供给待遇制度，也有某些不合理的，因此我们考绩的奖惩，不能过分拘泥。在可能范围内须加修正。
    （五）雇佣观点。这是旧社会的地主富农资本家和官僚政府压迫劳动者和公务员反映出来的东西，现在我们所有机关人员，都是国家主人之一，是革命职员，便不应再有这种观点，不要拿多少薪就做多少事，不要怕明天就不要我，不要做工作存心是给上级看而不是为人民服务。我们考勤考绩决不凭这种态度的。
    考绩标准
　  主要看对人民有无贡献和贡献大小
    总之，我们这次考绩工作重点，就是为克服上述这些不良现象，因此考绩的标准，主要看对人民有无贡献。这即是我们首先要看有无创造性，能否掌握业务，精通业务，要看能否克服困难，完成任务；要看是否有忘我的工作态度和集体主义的精神，帮助别人，推动别人；要看是否能够作到以一个人顶二个人和以一文钱办两文钱事的那样勤劳节省。有了上述一条，就应受奖励。
    按步就班，墨守成规，在旧政府或许是好职员，在我们这里是不受表扬的，因为他对人民并无贡献，因而人民无须给他额外的酬劳奖励。
    这次考绩中显著的一个问题，就是受奖的十七位同志的工作成就，是和他的政治开展与思想方法在若干方面的进步分不开的。例如吴颖同志对建立人事档案的细心积极；电话员杜慧卿能被称为“电话簿”；张保送信风雨夫阻，学会骑车和修车，已有显著节省；王丑子一人管六个屋子，勤劳整洁，滕麟阁已带出三个徒弟学会打字，自修机器又节省开支，他们的成绩都是和其思想上一定的进步分不开的。政治如不开展，一定思想方法不对头，就一定不能创造。所谓政治不开展，就是对新事物无感觉，对人民事业不钻研，不能跳出小圈子，不能在克服困难中完成任务。
    考绩原则有奖有罚
    第二、我们考绩制度就是具体的工作检查和建立严明的奖惩制度。原则是：有奖有罚，教育大家，以奖为主，鼓励前进。奖就是指示我们前进的方向，罚就是督促我们前进。
    这次受奖的十七位同志缺点当然是很多，只是说他们在若干方面，起了带头作用。这是对事不是对人，我们事业的发展是无止境的，今天的模范在将来看，就算不得什么了。今天的模范如不继续进步，明天也许变成为落后的了。因此受奖的人不应骄傲，要继续努力。未受奖的人不应不愉快，应争取向模范看齐。我们的目的是要大家前进。
    其次，政府机关的奖罚，不能仅是精神上的，这次除奖励物质外，有几位提升职务，有几位改变供给待遇和薪资，不称职的拉下来，有能力的提上去。我们这样做，是于人民有利的。是于初步打破“干不干，二斤半”和“五年十年改灶”的想法有利的。
    考绩方法
　  行政领导结合民主评议
    第三、我们考绩是以行政领导结合民主评议来进行的。这即是说，不是仅由群众作鉴定的方式，因为那样容易发生仅看表面，埋没人材。政府机关和群众团体不同，它有一定的领导关系，它有分工负责制，它有不同的任务，工作成绩有时不易被每人都了解的，同时政府机关工作中的制度是首长制，虽然在工作上也要走群众路线，但不和群众团体中一样。所以机关人员的考绩需要各级领导掌握，而结合民主评议来进行，目的为改进工作教育大家。
    考绩制度应是经常性的
    第四、我们考绩应是经常性的。以后每一年或每半年普遍搞一次。因为我们初创，也可能在明年春季工作计划完成时先搞一次。但人事考核是经常工作，因此要建立与健全请假制度，工作日志制度，考核登记制度等。不能仅凭印象，埋没功劳。
    以上四点初步经验总结，大家讨论后如同意，则应制订具体的考核条例，以便明年正式实行。
    彭真副主任最近指示我们：在目前干部困难的时候，要一个人顶几个人工作，要带徒弟，当小先生，要以学不诲厌、不倦的态度提高自己和培养干部，其次要发动业务学习，和调查研究工作，这样来着手开展我们各部门的业务工作。我们这次考绩的精神是一致的，大家应接受彭真同志的号召而具体贯彻下去。
    今天适逢世界革命领袖斯大林同志七十寿辰，彭泽民副主任发奖并给我们很多勉励和指示，在今天这可纪念的日子，是我们推进工作和提高自己的里程碑。受奖者是光荣的，未受奖者也是光荣的，因为光荣属于人民，是属于同志们的团结一致共同努力。
