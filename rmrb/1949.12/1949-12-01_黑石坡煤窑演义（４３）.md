It turned out that Bai Quan's family reported a rare thing to Shuan Cheng: that the Old Lord God haunting was fake, and that it was Jubaao and Qian Danao pretending to deceive people! The whole village had never known about this, and she had secretly heard it several times when she was delivering boiled water and cigarettes to Jubaao. Bai Quan's family also said: at that time, because Yubao had contributed to this matter, Jubaao wanted to marry her to Yubao, but she didn't want to, and they forced her. She argued with them face to face, saying that she would reveal the secret of the haunting and shout the ghost story out. That's how they didn't force her. But afterwards, she wasn't allowed to leave the gate, and they cruelly made it difficult for her to keep her life. When Jubaao fled to Taiyuan, she refused to go with him. Before he left, he even said, "Stinky girl! If you spread my ghost story, be careful when I come back to give you a good beating!" That's how he scared Bai Quan's family!

After Shuan Cheng heard this, he saw that Bai Quan's face was pale, and her dark eyebrows were constantly shaking, as if she was very afraid, so he quickly said, "Could it be that you are still afraid of Jubaao returning? Why didn't you say anything when you were complaining about your suffering some time ago? You are still a member of the poor peasant group!" Bai Quan's family said, "Look at what you're saying! What am I afraid of Jubaao returning! But this is about Jubaao harming Xilu! When Chunqi and Xilu were criticized, it hasn't been resolved yet. I thought if we complained about this suffering, wouldn't that be a little inappropriate?" Shuan Cheng felt that her thinking was correct, but he said, "This matter has also harmed Uncle Da San quite a bit!" Bai Quan's face flushed red, and she lowered her head without saying a word. Shuan Cheng continued, "Besides, this matter has also harmed our whole village! Not to mention those years, even now, because of this, the meetings are noisy and unclear. It would have been good if you had told our group earlier!" Bai Quan's family said, "That's right! When I thought of this just now, I felt that my mistake was not small, and I was panicked... What do you think should be done about this!" Shuan Cheng only felt that this was not a small matter, and he couldn't come up with a solution for a while, so he agreed with Bai Quan's family not to publicize it for the time being, and the two of them went back to the temple for a meeting.

Unexpectedly, when the two of them were wandering on the slope, Xiao Yang Gui was coming out to relieve himself. He happened to hear Bai Quan's family talking about the haunting on this side of the temple wall. He was so curious that he listened to the whole story in a panic before leaving. Later, Shuan Cheng went back and continued the meeting, but he didn't come to any conclusion. He just said that when Lao Yin returned, they must discuss opening the kiln and planning the big kiln. As for borrowing money, everyone could talk about it after going down. At present, they should still focus on distributing the fruits. After the meeting, Shuan Cheng only told the poor peasant group about the haunting. Xiao Yang Gui, however, kept this rare thing to himself, and he couldn't hold it in, so he quietly spread a bit of the shadow of this matter. Although not many people heard this shadow at that time, Yubao somehow faintly heard some of it, which stirred up the matter and disrupted the work in the village.

Thirty-Nine: Confession

It turned out that Yubao had been full of worries these days, turning them over and over in his mind. He was thinking about the bad things he had done, including helping Jubaao harm Xilu and Uncle Da San. After liberation, Qian Danao told him to spread rumors that the Communist Party killed and cooked people, and that the Yan army would occupy Yangquan, telling people not to tell Hua Da the truth, and the embezzlement he did during the struggle against Chunqi, and several other things he hadn't confessed. He had always believed that these things were too sinful, and he was determined not to say them; but these days, he always felt guilty, as if everyone knew his mistakes, and he couldn't sleep or sit still day and night. Now, no one in the village pays any attention to him, and he feels like he has nowhere to hide his face when he sees people. How can he be a person in the future! Even Uncle Niu Bao and his wife don't pay much attention to him. Uncle Niu Bao and his wife know about his bad deeds, wouldn't they reveal his secrets? Yubao also heard that Qian Danao was being detained in the county. The leaders in the county were teaching him well. He was producing and learning every day, and he had also confessed a lot of things, which also made him panic. Besides, he saw that the villagers had indeed turned over and become masters, and the work was going smoothly, and Shijiazhuang had also been liberated... Now, Yubao also heard that someone knew about his haunting, and he became even more panicked, feeling that there was no benefit to not confessing. He hesitated for another two days, and finally made up his mind to go to the temple to find Shuan Cheng and the members of the committee, and in one breath, he told about Qian Danao's arrangement for him to spread rumors, the embezzlement during the struggle against Chunqi, the situation of Jubaao instructing him to harm Xilu, and the fact that Jubaao asked him to spread rumors about the haunting with Niu Bao and Niu Bao's wife after the flood in the East Kiln. He also said that Jubaao's borrowing money from the owner of the Liugou Big Kiln for Xilu was also fake, and the money was actually Jubaao's own. Jubaao wanted to make the big kiln his own, and he flooded the kiln and then pretended it was haunted because there was no other way to explain it. Jubaao didn't sell the land or spend any money when he repaired the Old Lord Temple, he just falsely reported the accounts. He even used the gray from repairing the temple to whitewash his own house and kiln. Da San was also forced away by Jubaao who wanted to harm Xilu. When Da San was in the village, those bad things said about him were also Jubaao and Qian Danao's idea. Even the pumpkins in Da San's field were stolen by Yubao under Qian Danao's instructions...

Yubao confessed quite frankly this time. As soon as he spoke, the temple was crowded with people, and people asked questions one after another. In the end, Yubao was talking and crying in a cowardly manner, begging everyone to be lenient and deal with him. But the surrounding people gnashed their teeth and shouted to detain him and send him to the government. The Liugou family even wanted to use their tobacco pipes to beat him. Fortunately, Shuan Cheng and the others managed to calm everyone down.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（４３）
    康濯
    原来白泉家告给了拴成一件稀罕事：说那老君爷闹鬼是假的，是聚宝和乾大脑跟玉宝装着哄骗人的！浑村一直没有外人知道这事，她是好几回给聚宝送开水烟丸的时候，偷偷听说的；白泉家并说：那会就因为玉宝办这事有功，聚宝就要把她嫁给玉宝，她不愿，人家强逼她，她便当面跟人家闹，说要揭了那闹鬼的底，把鬼事往出嚷，这么着人家才没硬逼她。可是以后就不许她出大门，并狠毒地制得她好不容易才丢下条命；聚宝逃往太原的时候，她一定不跟去，人家临走还说“臭丫头！往后你要把老子闹鬼的事往外传，当心老子回来给你好看！这么吓唬白泉家哩！
    拴成听完这些，只见白泉家满脸发白，黑漆漆的眉毛不住抖动，还象很着怕的，就忙道：“莫非这会你还怕聚宝回？前些时诉苦你为啥不说？你还是个贫农组员哩！”白泉家道：“看你说的！我怕什么聚宝回啊！可这是聚宝害喜禄的事嘛！春起喜禄挨了斗争，前些时还没解决，我思谋要咱要诉出这苦，可不是不大对付么？”拴成觉着她这心思也对，但却又道：“这事把大三叔也害得不轻哩！”白泉家脸红了红，低头没话；拴成接着说：“再说这事也还害了咱浑村！不说那几年吧，这会就也因为这，闹得开会也咯吵不清的。你要早些跟咱小组说说也好嘛！”白泉家道：“可不是！刚才我想起这件事，觉出我这错误不小，就心慌地不行……你看这事怎么办吧！”拴成光觉着这不是个小事，一时还拿不出个对付办法，便跟白泉家约好先别声张，二人就又回庙里开会去了。
    不想他二人在坡坡上捣拉的时候，小洋鬼正出来解手；他在庙墙这边猛听见白泉家说到闹鬼的事，稀罕的不行，就心慌慌地直把根底缘由听完才走开。后来拴成回去接着开会，也没开出个长短，只是说等老尹回来一定要讨论开窑，计划大窑的事，等跟大三商议了再说，借现洋嘛，大伙下去了可以咯嚷咯嚷，这会还是要抓紧分果实；赶会开完，拴成只把闹鬼的事跟贫农组人们说了说，小洋鬼却别着这个稀罕事，一阵一阵地实在别不住，就不声不响地慢慢把这事传出了点影子。当时虽说听到这影子的人还不多，却不知怎么玉宝也隐隐忽忽听到一些，这可就把事情惹大了，把村里工作也搅乱了。
    三十九　坦白
    原来这些时玉宝正满肚子心事在翻上倒下地嘀咕。他想着他干的坏事，就还有帮聚宝害喜禄和大三的事，解放后乾大脑叫他造谣说共产党杀人煮人，说阎军还要占阳泉，叫人们不要给华大说实话，和春起斗争时候他的贪污等几件没坦白。他一直认定这几件事罪恶太大，下定决心不说的；但这些日子却总是心中有鬼，好象人人都知道他这些错误一般，日夜睡不安坐不稳。这会村里又是谁也不待搭理他，他见了人就只觉一张脸没处藏，这往后可怎么作人啊！就连牛宝叔嫂二人也不大理他，他的坏事牛宝叔嫂又都知道，他们不会给揭了底么？玉宝又听说乾大脑在县里扣着，县里领导教化好，他成天又生产又学习，并也坦白了不少事，这也叫他心慌。再说，他见到村里老百姓的确是翻身起来了，办工作是条条大道走得稳稳实实，而且石家庄也解放了呀……现在，玉宝又听到他那闹鬼的事也象有人知道了，他更慌乱起来，觉得再不坦白可就没一点好处。他又摩蹭了两天，最后还是下了狠心，上庙寻见拴成和众委员们，一口气把他听乾大脑安排的造谣、春起闹斗争的贪污，和聚宝指使他害喜禄的情由、水淹东窑以后聚宝叫他跟牛宝和牛宝他嫂造谣闹鬼的事实都说了；他并且还说到聚宝替喜禄去柳沟大窑主那借钱也是假的，钱实在就是聚宝自己的；聚宝是想把大窑闹归自己，后来水淹了没法交代才想法闹的鬼；修老君庙聚宝也没卖地也没花钱，他只是假报帐目，他连粉刷自己的房窑也是用的修庙的大灰；大三也是聚宝想害喜禄才逼走的，大三当日在村的时候，那些说他的坏话也是聚宝和乾大脑的主意，就连大三地里的窝瓜也是乾大脑指使玉宝去偷的……
    玉宝这一回说得倒还干脆。他一说，庙上就不知怎么挤满了人，人们还你问一句他问一句，到末了玉宝并一边说一边心虚得哭哭啼啼地，一个劲求大伙宽大他处理他；但周围人们却咬牙切齿地喊扣喊送政府，柳沟家还非要伸出旱烟管揍他，亏得拴成扁小们好容易才把大伙安静下来。
