　　[This News Agency] Jilin dispatch: Jilin Province is widely launching a winter literacy campaign organizing 600,000 people to study. In counties such as Huadian, Yitong, and Jiaohe, winter literacy committees have been established in each district. They are composed of district-level cadres, secretaries of the CCP branches in each village, village government chairmen, women's directors, and school teachers. Specific personnel are selected to be responsible for mobilizing and organizing the masses to participate in winter literacy programs, researching how to lead the study, and supervising and inspecting the winter literacy study situation in various locations. Some villages have already established winter literacy committees and have begun winter literacy studies. Sunjia Village in Tiangang District, Jiaohe County, has organized three literacy classes and eleven study groups. Out of the village's population of 1,003, except for the elderly over 60, those who are sick, and women with nursing infants (300+ people), the rest have all participated in the study and are divided into groups A, B, and C according to their level of literacy. Communist Party members participate separately in each group to promote everyone's learning. The Lafa District of the county has also conducted short-term winter literacy training courses, gathering village cadres and winter literacy teachers to summarize last year's winter literacy experience. After the winter literacy campaign started in the Yidan District of Yitong County, students from each central school were responsible for setting up cultural posts, hanging single-character signs and blackboard newspapers on the streets and at intersections to help everyone learn. At the same time, each winter literacy class conducts a test once a week and writes the test results on the blackboard newspaper, praising the good and criticizing the bad. In Yushu County, there are 320,000 illiterate people and 70,000 out-of-school children, accounting for more than 80% of the total population. Now, all party and government cadres in the county are working together to open more than 2,000 winter literacy schools, aiming for 120,000 people to participate in the study. The first step is to organize district and village cadres, party and youth league members, women's association members, and model self-defense team members to take the lead in participating in winter literacy programs to promote learning.

　　The teachers for the winter literacy programs are mainly primary school teachers and middle school and normal school students in the villages, followed by local cadres at all levels with a relatively high level of education, organizing the masses to solve the problem through mutual teaching and learning. The textbook uses the "Winter Literacy Textbook" compiled by the Northeast People's Government's Department of Culture and Education, supplemented by newspapers for those who already know some characters. In order to solve the urgent need for textbooks for the elementary classes of various winter literacy programs, the Provincial Department of Education has adapted the "Supplementary Winter Literacy Textbook" based on the "Civil School Literacy Textbook" of North China, which was published in the Jilin Worker-Peasant Daily on November 28, so that various villages can quickly start classes.

　　组织六十万人学习吉林冬学运动展开
    【本报讯】吉林消息：吉林全省组织六十万人学习的冬学运动，正在各地广泛展开。桦甸、伊通、蛟河等县，各区先后成立冬学委员会，由区负责干部及各村中共支部书记、村政府主席、妇女主任、学校教员等组成，选出专人，分头负责动员和组织群众参加冬学，研究怎样领导学习与促督检查各地冬学学习情形。有些村已成立冬学委员会，并已开始冬学的学习。蛟河县天岗区孙家村已组织了三个识字班，十一个学习小组，全村一千零三口人，除六十岁以上老人以及有病的与有吃奶孩子的妇女三百余人以外，其余全部参加了学习，并按文化程度分甲、乙、丙三组，中共党员分开参加各组，推动大家学习。该县拉法区并办了短期冬学训练班，集训村干与冬学教员，总结了去年冬学经验。伊通县伊丹区开办冬学后，由各中心学校学生负责设文化岗，在街头和十字路口挂单字牌，黑板报，帮助大家学习。同时各冬学每星期测验一次，将考试成绩写在黑板报上，好的表扬，坏的批评。榆树县全县有文盲三十二万，失学儿童七万，占总人口百分之八十以上，现全县党政干部一齐努力，要开办两千多处冬学，达到十二万人参加学习。头一步是组织区村干部、党团员、妇女会员、模范自卫队员等带头参加冬学，推动学习。
    冬学的师资，主要是小学教员和在乡中学生和师范生，其次是以文化程度较高的各级地方干部为主，组织群众以互教互学方式来解决。课本采用东北人民政府文教部编的“冬学课本”，已识一部分字的以报纸为补充教材。省教育厅应为解决各冬学初级班课本的急需，曾根据华北“民校识字课本”，改编“冬学识字补充课本”，刊于十一月二十八日吉林工农报，以便各村迅速上课。
