Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 11th: Due to the development and needs of the situation, a large number of rural cadres in North China have been promoted to work in counties and districts. These cadres, due to their low level of education or complete illiteracy, have encountered many difficulties and obstacles in their work. Therefore, improving the cultural level of these cadres is an urgent task for the leadership. Wuqiang County has attached importance to and solved this problem, achieving preliminary results. According to statistics from the county last September, out of 143 cadres, 40 were illiterate and 96 were semi-literate or had only attended junior primary school. The county leadership paid no attention to organizing cadres to study. Some individual leading cadres even ridiculed comrades who loved to study. Consequently, a confused idea of "working the same even if illiterate" and "being a roughneck is glorious" arose among the general cadres, creating an atmosphere where having a high level of education was shameful. It was not until March of last year that the county's leading organs began to feel the serious obstacles and harm to the work caused by the low level of education. Only then did they launch a learning movement. By January of this year, 13 cadres in the ten districts who were originally illiterate could write simple letters. Statistics from four districts in April showed that 37 cadres who were originally illiterate could roughly recognize characters, and 21 could write simple letters and read newspapers. Since the leadership in the county started ideological self-examination in March of last year, they also explained the great significance of learning at various meetings, citing the harm that neglecting learning caused to the people's cause. They established a learning system, paying attention to simultaneously mobilizing everyone to formulate specific plans, conscientiously adhering to a two-hour learning system, calling on each person to learn two new characters every day, and requiring them to be able to read newspapers and write simple letters. Before each time the work groups went to the countryside in the districts, they would also formulate plans, conduct inspections during gatherings, promptly commend, and carry out criticisms, launching a learning competition. At the same time, the districts compiled concise sentences based on the central work and departmental work and issued them to everyone to learn, so that they learned what they did, making it easy to accept, easy to remember, and immediately usable. For example, the county's promotion agency compiled sentences related to land reform policies such as "Urging the Recovery of Old Loans" and "Organizing Production" for the cadres of the seventh district to study, combining cultural learning with policy learning. In order to strengthen learning, the county successively transferred more than 60 primary school teachers, assigning them to various districts and departments, combining them with the original learning activists to form a learning core. When county cadres went to the countryside, they helped district cadres study. When district cadres went to the countryside, they selected learning group leaders and launched mutual assistance in writing letters. After cadres met, they tested each other, so that the leadership and the led, activists and general comrades, the literate and the illiterate were combined into a unified mutual assistance organization. The county's organization of learning was flexible and diverse. Each district-level and unit formulated a literacy progress table, which was filled out at each gathering, thus both checking and criticizing and commending. During collective learning, cadres helped each other, while when dispersed, they learned from primary school teachers, practicing writing letters, writing reports, and communicating with superiors or colleagues.

　　提高农村干部文化水平
  　武强抓紧领导学习
  　卅四个文盲学会写信
    【新华社北京十一日电】由于形势的发展与需要，华北各地大量的农村干部，被提拔起来担任县、区的工作。这些干部因文化程度低或根本不识字，在工作中遇到了不少困难和障碍。因此提高这些干部的文化水平，是领导上一个迫切的任务。武强县重视与解决这一问题，获得了初步成绩。据该县去年九月统计，一百四十三个干部中就有四十个文盲，九十六个半文盲或仅上过初小的，而县领导上毫不注意组织干部学习，甚至个别领导干部还讽刺爱学习的同志。因而一般干部间也产生“不识字也一样工作”、“老粗光荣”的糊涂观念，造成文化程度高反而耻辱的空气。直到去年三月间该县领导机关始感到文化水平太低对工作的严重障碍与危害性，从那时才开展了学习运动，至今年一月，十个区内就有十三个原先是文盲的干部会写便信了。四月份四个区的统计，又有三十七个原先是文盲干部能粗识文字，能写便信、看报的二十一人。该县自去年三月开始领导上即一面进行思想检查，一面在各种会议上以忽视学习给予人民事业的危害性，说明学习的重大意义，并建立学习制度，注意同时发动大家自订具体计划，认真坚持两小时学习制度，号召每人每天识两个生字，要求会看报、会写便信等。各区工作小组每次下乡前也订出计划，集会时进行检查，及时表扬，并进行批评，开展学习竞赛。同时，各区根据中心工作与部门工作编成简明的句字，发给大家学习，做到作什么学什么，故接受快，容易记，且马上能用。如县推进社编写了“催收旧贷”、组织生产”七区干部学习有关土地改革政策的字句等，使文化学习与政策学习结合起来。为了加强学习，该县曾先后调了六十多个小学教员，分配到各区和各部门，结合原有学习积极分子，形成学习核心。县干部下乡时即帮助区干学习，区干部下乡时，选出学习组长，并发动互助写信。干部见面后互相测验，使领导与被领导，积极分子与一般同志，识字的与不识字的结合成统一的互助组织。该县组织学习的方式是灵活的多样的。各区级各单位制识字进度表，每次集会时填写，这样一面检查，一面又是批评表扬。集体学习期间干部互助，分散时则向小学教员学习，练习写信、写报告、与上级或同级通信。
