　　Beijing West Station Employees Challenge Entire Railway Bureau
　  Guarantee Purchase of 4,000 Shares of Public Bonds
    Enthusiastic Subscription Exceeds 1,000 Shares in Nine Hours
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to promote the mass purchase of Victory Real Value Public Bonds by all employees, the Chinese Communist Party branch of Beijing West Station convened a branch meeting for special discussion; today, it held a meeting of Party members, Youth League members, and activists to mobilize subscriptions. The employees all recognize that the current financial and economic difficulties must be overcome by relying on ourselves, fully demonstrating the class position of the master, and all enthusiastically subscribed. Comrade Sun Zhenjun, a Party member, took the lead in subscribing to 50 shares. Everyone responded positively, and Li Yuchao and Li Shouyi from the loading and unloading team, not wanting to lag behind, also subscribed to 50 shares each. Many workers in the station subscribed to 20 or 30 shares, setting off a wave of enthusiasm for subscribing to Victory Public Bonds. In nine hours, more than 1,000 shares have already been subscribed. They are challenging the entire railway bureau, guaranteeing the purchase of 4,000 shares. This has driven other units in the area, such as the engineering section and the vehicle inspection section, to launch subscription campaigns.
    [Another Dispatch] The Tianjin Railway Beijing Locomotive Depot, Engineering Depot, and Vehicle Inspection Depot respectively held symposiums, unanimously believing that the issuance of People's Victory Real Value Public Bonds is completely reasonable. On the one hand, this can solve the current national financial and economic difficulties, and at the same time, it is conducive to developing production, and prices can also be relatively stable. They unanimously support and guarantee to mobilize everyone to subscribe. In addition, comrades from the ninth team of Beijing West Station initiated a challenge of one share per person, and everyone responded enthusiastically.
