Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th. The Central People's Government Ministry of Finance today issued the "Notice Entrusting the People's Bank of China to Issue People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds." The full text of the notice is as follows:

　　1. The People's Bank of China is entrusted with the printing, issuance, price calculation and announcement, collection of bond funds, payment of bond principal and interest, bond recovery and cancellation, and other technical matters related to the first phase of the 1950 People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds.

　　2. Local branches of the People's Bank of China and its affiliated specialized banks, as well as entrusted sales agencies, may issue a "Temporary Receipt" after receiving the subscriber's payment but before receiving the bonds, which can be exchanged for formal bonds.

　　3. The issuance period for this public bond is from January 5, 1950, to the end of March, and interest will be calculated from April 1st. In order to take care of the interests of early subscribers, the government has stipulated that those who subscribe and pay from January 5, 1950, to the end of the month will receive a subsidy of two-twelfths of the annual interest; those who subscribe and pay from February 1st to the end of the month will receive a subsidy of one-twelfth of the annual interest; and those who subscribe and pay from March 1st will no longer receive a subsidy.

　　4. Bond payments must be made in Renminbi. However, to facilitate payment for subscribers holding gold, foreign currency, or foreign exchange, they are permitted to exchange up to 30% of the total subscription amount for Renminbi at designated banks according to the exchange rate.

　　5. Agencies entrusted by the People's Bank of China to sell the bonds will receive a handling fee of five per thousand of the bond proceeds and will not receive any other subsidies.

　　6. Foreign nationals and their enterprises within China who wish to subscribe to this public bond will receive the same treatment as Chinese citizens.

　　China People's Bank Measures Regarding Subsidized Interest Rates for Subscribing to the First Phase of the 1950 People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds

　　(1) Article 6 of the People's Victory Indexed Public Bond Regulations stipulates that the interest rate is 5% per annum, and interest will be paid once a year from March 31, 1951. As the issuance of this public bond began on January 5, 1950, in order to take care of the interests of early subscribers, special provisions are made for subsidized interest rates.

　　(2) The subsidized interest rate provisions are divided into two periods: the first period (January 5 to January 31) will receive a subsidy of two-twelfths of the annual interest; the second period (February 1 to February 28) will receive a subsidy of one-twelfth of the annual interest; from March 1 to the end of the issuance period, no interest subsidy will be given.

　　(3) The above-mentioned interest subsidy shall be deducted from the bond payment at the indexed price on the date of subscription.

　　(4) The amount of interest paid for the subsidy shall be calculated to the nearest yuan, and amounts below the yuan shall be rounded off.

　　(5) An example of the calculation method for the interest subsidy is as follows:

　　Assuming that the price of a one-fen bond is 15,000 yuan, the annual interest should be 750 yuan. Divided by twelve, each month is 62 yuan and 5 jiao, that is, the first period subsidy is 125 yuan, and the second period subsidy is 62 yuan and 5 jiao. (In actual calculations, the amount below yuan in the above example shall be rounded off in accordance with the previous article)

　　Unit Calculation Table for Subsidized Interest Rates by Stage
　　First period 　　One-fen bond　0.008333333　　Ten-fen bond　0.083333333
　　　　　　　　One-hundred-fen bond　0.833333333　　Five-hundred-fen bond　4.166666666
　　Second period　 One-fen bond　0.004166666　　Ten-fen bond　0.041666666
　　　　　　　　One-hundred-fen bond　0.416666666　　Five-hundred-fen bond　2.083333333

　　Note 1: The above two types of interest subsidies are calculated to eight decimal places. If the amount of public bonds subscribed is large, the number of decimal places can be increased and used flexibly, and should not be limited by the numbers in the table.

　　Note 2: The numbers in the table are the result of dividing the annual interest of 5% for each type and one unit into one-twelfth (second-period interest subsidy) and two-twelfths (first-period interest subsidy).

　　China People's Bank Measures for Entrusted Sales of the First Phase of 1950 People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds

　　(1) In addition to the People's Bank of China Head Office and its affiliated institutions designated for sales, the People's Bank of China may entrust local post offices, silver shops, cooperatives, etc., to sell the bonds on its behalf as needed. The entrustment procedures shall be handled by means of an exchange of documents.

　　(2) The People's Bank of China shall give each entrusted sales agency a handling fee of five per thousand of the bond sales amount, but no other expenses will be subsidized.

　　(3) After each entrusted sales agency receives the public bonds entrusted for sale and verifies that there are no errors, the person in charge shall issue a formal receipt to be kept by the People's Bank of China. If the unsold portion of the public bonds is returned, and the People's Bank of China verifies that it is consistent, a receipt shall also be issued to the sales agency to clear the procedures.

　　(4) Each entrusted sales agency shall submit the amount of bond sales and a list of the bonds sold to the entrusting bank for verification and receipt on the same day.

　　(5) If each entrusted sales agency is far away from the entrusting bank or is unable to deliver the public bond funds and list on the same day due to transportation reasons, the entrusting bank may consider the actual situation and agree on a clearing time, and must report to the superior bank for record.

　　(6) Local branches of the People's Bank of China have the right to inspect the sales of bonds and the remittance of bond funds by the entrusted sales agencies at any time.

　　(7) Local branches of the People's Bank of China shall submit a request to the government for commendation of those entrusted sales agencies that have achieved outstanding results in selling bonds, and may terminate the entrustment at any time and pursue legal action against those who violate the provisions of Article 4, or who commit illegal acts of fraud and undermine the credit of the public bonds.

　　(8) The handling fee that each entrusted sales agency should receive may be deducted from the bond sales proceeds remitted, and a handling fee receipt shall be issued to be kept by the People's Bank of China.

　　(9) These measures shall be implemented by the Head Office of the People's Bank of China and filed with the Ministry of Finance for record, and the same shall apply to amendments.

　　China People's Bank Service Measures for Overseas Chinese to Subscribe to the First Phase of the 1950 People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds

　　(1) In order to facilitate overseas Chinese compatriots to subscribe to this public bond, the Bank of China in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou are designated to handle subscription and other procedures on their behalf.

　　(2) When overseas Chinese compatriots subscribe to this public bond, they can send a letter stating the type, quantity, mailing address, and method of handling the bonds they wish to purchase, and remit the funds to the designated Bank of China mentioned above for handling. Overseas Chinese compatriots can transfer funds to the Bank of China in the above-mentioned locations through the designated bank in their country. Foreign banks that are willing to remit funds for our overseas Chinese compatriots to subscribe to public bonds may follow the above regulations.

　　(3) The entrusted bank shall convert various foreign currencies remitted by overseas Chinese compatriots for subscription to this public bond into Renminbi according to the foreign exchange rate of each location on the date of receipt of the remittance, and then convert them into bonds according to the price of each fen of the public bond. The fractional amount that is insufficient to subscribe to one fen of the public bond may be deposited by the agent bank as "indexed deposits"; the funds insufficient for the "indexed deposit" unit shall be temporarily collected, and the agent bank shall inform the subscriber by letter for handling.

　　(4) If overseas Chinese compatriots entrust the agent bank to keep the public bonds on their behalf, each agent bank shall handle the safekeeping procedures and issue a safekeeping certificate to the subscriber.

　　(5) If the public bonds kept by each agent bank on behalf of overseas Chinese compatriots have been drawn or have reached the maturity date for repayment of principal and interest, and the subscriber is unable to send the safekeeping certificate to the agent bank on schedule due to some reason, the agent bank may first handle the repayment of principal and interest based on the bond. If the subscriber has not specified the use of all the principal and interest due in advance, the agent bank shall deposit it as an "indexed deposit" on their behalf and inform the subscriber by letter to send the safekeeping certificate as soon as possible for endorsement or exchange.
