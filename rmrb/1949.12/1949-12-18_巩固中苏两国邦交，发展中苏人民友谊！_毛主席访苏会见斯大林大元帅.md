    Dear Comrades and Friends: I am very pleased to have the opportunity to visit the capital of the world's first great socialist country, the Soviet Union. The people of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union have a deep friendship. After the October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet government, according to the policies of Lenin and Stalin, was the first to abolish the unequal treaties imposed on China during the Tsarist era. In the nearly thirty years since then, the Soviet people and the Soviet government have repeatedly assisted the Chinese people's cause of liberation. The Chinese people will never forget this brotherly friendship from the Soviet people and the Soviet government in times of difficulty.
    The important tasks at present are to consolidate the world peace front led by the Soviet Union, oppose war instigators, consolidate the diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. I believe that due to the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China, due to the joint efforts of the new democratic countries and the peace-loving people of the world, due to the common wishes and close cooperation of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, and especially due to the correct international policies of Marshal Stalin, these tasks will be fully realized and achieve good results.
    Long live Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation!
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th: TASS, Moscow, December 16th: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Stalin, received Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on December 16th.
