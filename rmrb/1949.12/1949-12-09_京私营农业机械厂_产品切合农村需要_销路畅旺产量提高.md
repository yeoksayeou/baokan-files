Beijing News: Private iron factories in Beijing that manufacture agricultural machinery are seeing increased business due to the close connection between their production and the needs of farmers. Agricultural machines such as rice mills, threshing machines, and straw rope machines produced by Xin Fu, Guo Hua, and Cheng Zhang factories have been actively promoted in rural areas this autumn, and they have cooperated with farmers in rice milling. The Xin Fu Iron Factory's production of these three types of machines totaled more than 100 units this year, a two-fold increase compared to before liberation. Sales have spread to Haidian, Changping, Zhuolu, Zhangjiakou, Taiyuan, and even Shanghai and Hankou have sent letters requesting drawings of threshing machines, preparing to order them from the factory. The factories sell rice mills and straw rope machines on a cash-on-delivery basis, while threshing machines are sold to farmers on a credit basis with payment in rice. As for the factories' deep involvement in rural areas and cooperation with farmers in rice milling, the factories provide the machinery, fuel, and technology, while the farmers participate in simple labor. This machine milling not only improves the quality of the rice, making the grains finer and more complete, compared to using manual or animal-powered stone mills, but also greatly increases the milling efficiency. In the past, four or five people plus two mules and a stone mill could produce about 300 jin of rice per day. Now, four or five people can manage a machine, consuming 400 jin of firewood per day, and can mill 6,000 jin of rice. Therefore, farmers are extremely welcoming of machine milling. In addition, the production of steel plate mills is also increasing daily. For example, the steel plate mills produced by the Gong Da Cheng Factory are light, compact, easy to carry and install. The largest weighs 450 jin, while the smallest weighs only 80 jin. They can grind wheat and corn, with high efficiency and low cost, so sales are good. Over the past four or five months, Nanjing, Taiyuan, Kaifeng, Zhangjiakou, and other places have purchased more than 30 units, more than double the amount before liberation. If they are further promoted in rural areas or small and medium-sized cities, sales should be even more brisk.

　　京私营农业机械厂
  　产品切合农村需要
  　销路畅旺产量提高
    【北京讯】京市制造农业机器的私营铁工厂，因生产与农民需要密切结合，业务益见开展。信孚、国华、成章等工厂生产的碾米机、打稻机、草绳机等农业机器，今秋以来纷纷下乡推销，并与农民合作加工碾米。信孚铁工厂三种机器产量今年共百余台，比解放前增加达两倍，销路遍及京西海甸、昌平、涿鹿、张家口、太原，甚至上海、汉口等地也来信索取打稻机图样，准备向该厂订造。各厂出售碾米机、草绳机是用现款订制，出售打稻机是以大米折实贷售农民的方式。至于各厂深入乡村与农民合作加工碾米，系由工厂出机器、燃料和技术，农民参加简单劳动，这样用机器碾米比原来用人力、畜力使用石碾不但米的质量提高，米粒精细完整，且碾米效率大为提高。过去四、五个人加上两个骡子、一盘石碾，日产约三百斤米，现在四、五个人管一部机器，每日消耗四百斤木柴，可碾六千斤米，因此农民对用机器碾米极为欢迎。此外，制造钢板磨的工厂生产也日渐提高，如公大成工厂的钢板磨，机型轻巧便于携带按装，最大号的重四百五十斤，最小号的只重八十斤，可磨小麦、玉米，效能高、成本低，所以销路好。南京、太原、开封、张家口等地，四、五个月来先后购去三十余台，比解放前增加一倍多；如再深入农村或中小城市推广，销路当更畅旺。
