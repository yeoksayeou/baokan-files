Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 22nd: At the Second Shanghai People's Representative Conference, Mayor Chen Yi delivered the opening address on the 5th. The full text is as follows: Representatives, Comrades:

The Chairman has decided that I shall announce the opening of the Second Shanghai People's Representative Conference.

		Four Months of Tortuous and Complex Struggle to Overcome the Enemy's Blockade and Sabotage
The First Representative Conference concluded on August 5th, exactly four months ago. When the imperialist and Kuomintang reactionaries' blockade began not long before in July, there was not much experience in countering the blockade. At that time, the situation of Shanghai's industry and commerce was extremely serious. For example, the machinery industry was almost on the verge of collapse, the cost of the textile industry was higher than the selling price, department stores had difficulty in sales, and grain prices led commodity prices to rise, making the vast majority of wage earners uneasy, resulting in more than 2,000 labor-capital disputes in July. Shanghai's industry and commerce were actually in a state of difficult survival at that time. Some people were very pessimistic, believing that prices could not be stabilized; that industry and commerce were blockaded, the sea routes were blocked, and there was no future. Imperialist elements had been constantly predicting in June and July that Shanghai would perish under the rule of the People's Government. However, after concentrated discussion and careful study at our First Representative Conference, we unanimously adopted the policy and six major tasks proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee to oppose the blockade by imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries and build a new Shanghai. In the past few months, under the leadership of the People's Municipal Government, the people of Shanghai have unanimously implemented the policy of the First Representative Conference. After various twists and turns and complex struggles, after the stabilization of prices in August and September, the situation of Shanghai's industry and commerce began to improve, the income of the municipal treasury also began to be more ample than before, and local municipal construction and municipal repairs also began. This proves that the anti-blockade policy submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee to the First Representative Conference and adopted is correct, and the efforts of the government and the people have not been in vain. The enemy's blockade, bombing, and sabotage cannot scare us. We have ways to deal with disasters and floods. Especially the birth of the great People's Republic of China on October 1st, the establishment of the great Central People's Government, followed by the recognition of the new China by the great friendly Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, the great political achievements, coupled with the rapid development of the military on the front lines in the past four months, plus the efforts to restore the economy and overcome disasters all over the country, proved the great creativity of the Chinese people and opened up a bright future. Under the impetus of the excellent political and military situation across the country, the economic situation in Shanghai has also begun to improve in fact.

		Shanghai Cooperates with the Whole Country, the Whole Country Supports Shanghai, Overcoming Difficulties.
What is the experience of overcoming difficulties and striving for improvement in the past four months? I believe that it lies in the close unity between the government and the people, in the people's support and implementation of the government's policies, in the government and the people relying on thrift, hard work, and self-reliance, and in focusing on supporting the front lines and breaking the blockade as a link in the struggle against the enemy. We would like to point out here that "the role of the People's Shanghai in supporting the front lines is very great." It lies in emphasizing unity and education, not being afraid to bear increased burdens, and adopting the principle of sharing food for the treatment and work of the large number of salaried personnel, and correcting the practice of kicking aside in some aspects; it lies in adopting strict punishments and suppression of speculative manipulation and improper business activities for profit; even more, it lies in the fact that the People's Government has mastered a considerable amount of materials, which has played an active role in stabilizing prices; even more, it lies in the fact that there is a Central People's Government in the country that has never been able to truly unify the country and truly be honest and impartial in Chinese history. Under his leadership and help, with Shanghai cooperating with the whole country and the whole country supporting Shanghai, it has guaranteed that our Shanghai can overcome the difficulties in July and have price stability and economic improvement in August and September. We should study the above experiences and lessons, and not forget them.

The Second Representative Conference opens today. I suggest that we continue to make efforts to counter the blockade based on the experience of the past four months, and never stop until we achieve our goal. We should emphasize that the second price surge in October, which began to stabilize relatively in November, has created a great possibility that the situation in Shanghai will continue to improve. But at the same time, we should point out that the so-called improvement is insufficient and not comprehensive, because there are still serious difficulties at present, such as the approaching end of the year, the wages of the vast majority of workers and public educators can only barely maintain their lives, refugees are returning, the phenomenon of unemployment cannot be solved, and although many sectors of industry and commerce are becoming more active and developing (many of which are very important sectors, such as the machinery industry, the hardware industry, etc.), some sectors are still in an extremely serious situation. The above-mentioned difficulties need to be overcome urgently. In summary, the economic and production situation in Shanghai has partly or mostly moved towards a better path, and some parts or several important departments are still in a very difficult situation, with the danger of production stopping. As far as the improvement is concerned, we are full of confidence and have all the means to gradually improve the affairs of Shanghai; as far as the current difficult parts are concerned, we should not be blindly optimistic, and we should not relax our attention. This is the specific situation of Shanghai's economic production that our Second Shanghai People's Representative Conference is facing at its opening. Recognizing this situation naturally makes it necessary for us to adopt a self-reliant course of action based on the basis of improvement to overcome the existing difficulties.

		Profiteering and Speculation are Bound to Fail and Must Be Changed.
Let me compare the basic differences between the price surge in July and the price surges in October and November. The reasons for the price surge in July were: Shanghai was initially liberated, the enemy blockaded, transportation was not restored, rural work was not developed, urban and rural areas did not communicate, the foreign market was cut off, the domestic market was not opened, and most of Fujian, South China, Southwest, Northwest, and Central China were still occupied by the enemy. The situation in Shanghai at that time was sitting and eating the mountains, with only outflow and no inflow, and almost all industry and commerce were on the verge of collapse. Is the situation of the second price increase in Shanghai in October and November the same as the above situation in July? Obviously not. Because the enemies in the Southwest, Northwest, and South China have been driven away, or will soon be completely eliminated. The domestic market is opened without hindrance, transportation is restored quickly, rural work is developed, urban and rural areas communicate, and Shanghai and other provinces increase their mutual needs. As a result, Shanghai's economic life has been greatly enlivened. Although price increases are still inevitable, the main reason is that the war burden has increased, which has increased the issuance of currency. As long as the remaining enemies are completely eliminated, the associated enemy blockade will also be basically broken. Everyone who thinks more can understand that this increase is not terrible, can be overcome, and cannot prevent the improvement of our cause. The most regrettable thing is that some people not only do not understand the difference between the price fluctuations in July and October and November, but especially do not understand the difference between the People's Government and the Kuomintang reactionary government, do not understand the difference between our temporary difficulties after victory and the irreparable difficulties when the Kuomintang reactionary government perished, and even do not understand the difference between the Renminbi and the pseudo-gold and silver coupons. As a result, they lost their minds and were fooled by speculators under the conditions of price fluctuations. This is a major event that should be strengthened in propaganda and education. Even in terms of speculators, in the two price increases in July and October and November, did your estimates that prices would continue to rise and would not fall back be consistent with the facts? Did each of you make money or lose money? Those many speculators who have been sanctioned by the People's Government, are you willing, and can you repent? It is good for me to raise these questions. At least after review, it can promote awareness and awaken some people to turn back. Here, I solemnly point out that in the new China era of the people, all problems are undergoing great changes, and many old views, old styles, and old calculations should also change accordingly, which is good for both people and oneself.

		Accept Chairman Mao's New Instructions to Restore the Economy Through Self-Reliance
Now I don’t want to talk about how to maintain the basis of improvement, I just want to talk about how to overcome the current serious difficulties. Here, let me introduce Chairman Mao’s recent instructions. Chairman Mao said at the meeting of the Central People's Government on December 2: "To sum up our situation, we have difficulties, we have solutions, and we have hope. Our financial situation is difficult, and we must explain our difficulties to the people and not hide them. But at the same time, we must also explain to the people that we do have ways to overcome difficulties. Since we have ways to overcome difficulties, our cause is hopeful, and our future is bright. Our situation will be better year by year. It is estimated that next year will be better than this year. Within three to five years, our economic cause can be fully restored, and within ten to eight years, our economy can be greatly developed." Chairman Mao's instruction should become our action instruction to end this year and welcome the next year to overcome difficulties. He helps us to be unwavering and confident that in the next few years, we can strive for our cause to move from overcoming difficulties to improvement and great development. According to my personal understanding, our greatest difficulty lies in the heavy war burden, but in fact, it is clearly pointed out that the remaining enemies will soon be completely eliminated, and this burden can be gradually reduced. The so-called indeed having ways to overcome difficulties, my understanding is that this refers to the government and the people uniting as one, adopting appropriate policies, and engaging in economic recovery through production mutual assistance, thrift, and self-reliance. The active support and purchase of the Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds issued by the Central People's Government by the people across the country is also one of the most important ways to overcome difficulties. China is vast, rich in resources, and has a large population. In addition, we have a clear and honest political situation and we can do it ourselves. This is of course promising, and there are certainly many ways, so our hope is infinite. If my understanding is not too wrong, applied to the current situation in Shanghai, the local difficulties that exist can be overcome by the people and the government uniting to overcome them through self-reliance. For example, why can’t the difficulties of closing down in the textile industry, silk weaving industry, publishing industry, shipping industry, theater and film industry, and other industries be solved by self-reliance? I suggest that the industries that have improved find ways to help the industries that have not improved, the enterprises that have prospered help the enterprises that have not prospered, and various enterprises facing difficulties explain the difficulties to all employees, and call on them to overcome the difficulties as the first priority. All citizens mobilize the city's idle funds to help the improvement of industry and commerce, and eradicate improper behavior of speculation and profiteering. The People's Government should follow a policy that takes into account both public and private interests and benefits both labor and capital to help solve difficulties. I believe that the six million people of Shanghai have infinitely great economic power. If they are fully mobilized, well organized, and added to the appropriate assistance from the Central People's Government leading the national forces, what difficulties cannot be overcome? The pessimistic tone is completely unfounded. Our Second People's Representative Conference should stand under Chairman Mao's instructions and fight to overcome the current difficulties and to strive for most of the improvement and all of the improvement. Here, please listen carefully to the municipal report of the past four months and conduct a good review; listen carefully to the Shanghai financial report and add a careful summary and discussion; carefully consider the election of the Consultative Committee of the People's Representative Conference of all sectors of the city. If our representative conference does these three agendas well and makes our conference a complete success, I believe that after the Second Representative Conference, the situation in Shanghai will definitely be greatly improved, and the municipal work will definitely be promoted to a new stage!

　　上海二届人民代表会议上
    陈市长号召克服困难
    开幕词中建议根据四个月经验，继续努力反封锁，渡过难关，自力更生，把上海的事办好。
    【新华社上海二十二日电】陈毅市长五日在上海市第二届各界代表会议上致开幕词。全文如下：各位代表先生，各位代表同志：
    主席决定我来宣布上海第二届各界代表会议开幕。
    　　　　四个月的曲折复杂斗争战胜了敌人的封锁破坏
    第一届代表会议于八月五日闭幕，迄今恰满四个月。当七月间帝国主义和国民党反动派的封锁开始不久，一般对反封锁的经验尚不多，当时上海工商业的情况是极其严重的。例如：当时的机器业几乎处于崩溃的境地，纺织业成本高于卖价，百货业销售困难，粮价领导物价而上涨，使广大依靠工薪为生的人员惴惴不安，因而劳资纠纷在七月份达二千件以上。上海工商业在当时实际处于难于维持的状态。一部分人士很悲观，认为物价是不能稳定的；工商业被封锁，海口不通，是无前途的。帝国主义分子六七两月曾不断预言上海在人民政府管理之下要灭亡。可是经过我们第一届代表会议的集中讨论，细心研究，一致通过中共市委所提的反对帝国主义和国民党反动派的封锁，和建设新上海的方针及六大任务。几个月来，上海人民在人民市政府领导之下，均一致执行第一届代表会的方针，经过各种曲折与复杂的斗争，经过八九两月物价稳定，上海工商业的情况开始好转了，市库的收入也开始较前宽裕了，市政局部建设与市政修整也开始了。这证明中共市委提交第一届代表会所通过的反封锁的方针是正确的，政府与人民的努力不是白费的。敌人的封锁轰炸破坏是吓不倒我们的。我们对灾荒水患是有办法对付的。尤其是十月一日伟大的中华人民共和国的诞生，伟大的中央人民政府的成立，接着伟大友邦苏联及各人民民主国家承认新中国，伟大的政治成就配合着四个月来前线军事的神速发展，加上在全国各地恢复经济、克服灾荒的努力，证明了中国人民的伟大创造力，打开了光明灿烂的前途。我们上海的经济情况在全国优良的政治军事情况的推动之下，也在事实上开始好转了。
    　　　　上海配合全国，全国支援上海，克服了困难。
    四个月来克服困难争取好转的经验是什么呢？我认为是在于政府与人民的亲密团结，是在于人民拥护和执行政府的政策，是在于政府与人民依靠节衣省食、努力生产、自力更生，是在于着重抓到了支援前线、打破封锁的对敌斗争的环节。我们在此指出“人民的上海对于支援前线的作用是很大。是在于强调团结教育，不怕担负加重，对庞大薪工人员的待遇和工作采取匀饭吃的方针，纠正了某些方面一脚踢开的办法；是在于对投机操纵和不正当营业牟利的活动采取了严厉的惩处与镇压；更在于民人政府手中掌握了相当大的物资，对平抑物价起了积极作用；更在于在全国有了在中国历史上从来没有过的真能统一全国的、真能廉洁奉公的中央人民政府，在他的领导和帮助之下，以上海配合全国，以全国支援上海，便保证了我们上海能渡过七月的难关，而有八九两月的物价稳定与经济情况好转。我们应该研究上述的经验教训，不要忘记它。
    第二届代表会今天开幕，我建议应根据四个月的经验继续作反封锁的努力，不达目的绝不休止。我们应着重指出：十月份第二次物价高涨，到十一月份已开始相对的稳定，这业已造成了上海情况会继续好转的极大可能。但同时我们应该指出所谓好转是不充分的，是不全面的，因为目前仍然存在着严重的困难，如年关迫近，广大工人群众及公教人员的薪给只能勉强维持，难民倒流，失业现象不能解决，工商业很多部门虽已日见活跃日益向前发展（其中许多部门而且是很重要的部门，如机器业、五金业等），但某些部门仍处在极其严重的境地，上述困难是急待克服的。总括说来，上海经济生产情况一部或大部业已走向好转的途径，一部分或某几个重要部门，仍然处境极其困难，生产有停闭的危险。就好转方面来说，我们充满了信心，有一切办法把上海的事逐渐办好；就目前困难的部分来说，尚不容我们盲目乐观，尚不应该放松我们的注意力。这就是我们上海第二届各界代表会目前开幕时面临的上海经济生产情况的具体形势。认清楚这个形势，自然使我们必须采取根据好转的基础，去克服现有困难的自力更生的行动方针。
    　　　　哄抬物价，投机取巧，必然失败，必须改变。
    让我来比较一下七月物价高涨与十月、十一月物价高涨的基本区别。七月物价高涨的原因是：上海初解放，敌人封锁，交通未恢复，农村工作未展开，城乡不交流，国外市场断绝，国内市场亦未打开，福建、华南、西南、西北及华中之大部，尚为敌人所盘踞，上海的当时情况是坐吃山空，有出无进，几乎全部工商业濒临绝境。十月和十一月上海第二次物价上涨的情况，是不是与七月份上述情况相同的呢？显然不是的。因为西南、西北、华南的敌人业已赶走，或不久即完全被消灭。国内市场无阻碍地打开，交通恢复很快，农村工作展开，城乡通气，上海与各省互相需求增加。因而上海经济生活大大的活跃起来，虽然仍然免不了物价上涨，其主要原因是由于战争负担加重，增加了通货的发行。只要残余敌人完全消灭，连带的敌人封锁亦将基本打破。每一个人多加思索，均能明了这个上涨是不可怕的，是可以克服的，是不能阻止我们事业的好转的前途的。最可婉惜的，是一部分人们不仅不了解七月与十月十一月两者物价跳动的区别，尤其不去了解人民政府与国民党反动派政府的区别，不去了解我们胜利后暂时困难与国民党反动派灭亡时无可挽救的困难的区别，甚至对人民币与伪金银券的区别也不了解，因而失掉头脑，在物价波动的条件下，受了投机商人的愚弄，这倒是应该加强宣传教育的一件大事。即是就投机商人们来说，你们在七月与十月十一月的两次物价上涨中，你们的估计认为物价一定继续涨，一定不能回跌，是不是与事实符合？你们每一个人是不是都赚了钱或是赔了本呢？那许多受了人民政府制裁的投机商人，你们心不心甘，是否能有悔悟？我提一提这些问题有好处，至少经过检讨可以促进觉悟，可以唤起一些人回头。这里我郑重提出，在人民的新中国时代，一切问题正在掀起伟大的改变，许多旧观点、旧作风、旧的算盘也应跟着改变，对人对己均有好处的。
    　　　　接受毛主席新指示自力更生恢复经济
    我现在想不说如何保持好转的基础，我只想说一说如何去克服目前的严重困难。这里让我来介绍毛主席新近的指示。毛主席在十二月二日中央人民政府会议上说：“我们的情况概括地说来就是：有困难的，有办法的，有希望的。我们的财政情况是有困难的，我们必须要向人民说明我们的困难所在，不要隐瞒这种困难。但是我们同时也必须向人民说明，我们确实有办法克服困难。我们既然有办法克服困难，我们的事业就是有希望的，我们的前途是光明的。我们的情况会一年比一年好起来，估计明年要比今年好。在三年五年的时间内，我们的经济事业可以完全恢复，在十年八年的时间内，我们的经济就可以得到巨大的发展。”毛主席这个指示，应该成为我们结束今年迎接明年的克服困难的行动指示。他帮助我们能坚定不移地有信心在最近几年内能争取我们的事业从克服困难走向好转和巨大发展。照我个人的理解，我们的最大的困难在于战争负担很重，但是事实上明白指出，残余敌人不久即完全消灭，这个负担可以逐步减轻。所谓确实有办法克服困难，我的理解这是指政府与人民团结一致，采取适当政策，从生产互助、节衣省食、用自力更生的办法去从事经济的恢复。全国人民能积极拥护和争购中央人民政府所发行的胜利折实公债，也是克服困难最重要的办法之一。我们中国地大、物博、人多，加上我们政治清明，自己会搞，这当然是有指望的，办法当然是很多，因而我们希望是无穷的。假如我理解的不会大错，运用到上海目前情况，则目前存在着的局部困难，是可以用人民与政府团结起来用自力更生的办法去克服的。例如纺织业、丝织业、出版业、航业、剧影业以及其他各业的停闭困难，为什么不能用自力更生办法去解决呢？我建议已好转的各业设法协助未好转的各业，已兴旺的企业协助未兴旺的企业，各种面临困难的企业向全体职工说明困难，号召以渡过困难为第一义。全体市民动员全市游资来协助工商业好转，根绝投机牟利的不正当行为。人民政府当一本公私兼顾，劳资两利的政策来协助解决困难。我相信上海六百万人民具有无限大的经济力量，充分发动起来，很好组织起来，加上中央人民政府领导全国力量适当协助，有什么困难不能克服呢？悲观的论调是完全无根据的。我们第二届各界代表会议，应站在毛主席指示之下，为克服目前困难而奋斗，为争取大部好转和全部好转而奋斗。在这里请各位代表细心听取四个月来市政报告，并加以很好的检讨；细心听取上海财经报告，并加细心的总结和讨论；细心考虑来推选本市各界人民代表会议协商委员会。如果我们代表会把这三个议程做得很好，使我们的会议获得完满的成功，我相信第二届代表会之后，上海的情况一定更大好转，市政工作一定能提到更新的阶段！
