　　North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company
　　Supplies Yarn and Cloth to Various Regions
　　Exchanges Yarn and Cloth for Cotton to Cooperate with Production and Help People Overcome Famine; Organizes Weaving Machines in Disaster Areas, Reaching Six to Seven Thousand
　　[Reported by This Newspaper] Since its establishment in September, the North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has adhered to the方針 of developing production, supplying raw materials, promoting finished products, implementing urban-rural exchange, and determining market prices. In addition to directly supplying the Tianjin market in large quantities, its branches in major cities, including Tianjin, Tangshan, Beijing, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Handan, Linqing, Xinxiang, Taiyuan, and their respective subordinate branch companies, have also fully demonstrated the basic spirit of urban-rural mutual assistance and exchange. Besides directly signing contracts with local yarn factories to supply raw materials and promote finished products, the company has also successively dispatched large quantities of yarn and cloth to various regions. From September to November, a total of nearly 250,000 bolts of white cloth, over 100,000 bolts of colored cloth, and over 9,000 pieces of various yarns were sent. In addition to supplying the market in large quantities, these materials were also sold through retail agencies and directly supplied to farmers in small quantities, meeting their needs. In many places, three or four farmers jointly bought a bolt of cloth to share, which was widely appreciated. In addition, during this year's cotton harvest, various regions directly used the method of exchanging yarn and cloth for cotton. According to the experience of many places, farmers particularly welcomed colored cloth. The branch companies further utilized the method of exchanging yarn for cloth to support the development of weaving machines in various regions, especially in disaster areas, achieving considerable success in combining production with famine relief. Currently, the total number of electric and manual looms organized and supported in various regions is estimated to be around six to seven thousand, and this work is still developing.
    Furthermore, some places, such as the Jinpu Railway area and a part of the Northwest, use publicly owned production and transport cotton to the company in exchange for yarn and cloth. The Northwest even exchanges cloth for wool and cotton, and then exchanges them back for yarn and cloth, greatly promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The cotton exchanged by the companies is directly supplied to spinning factories as raw materials. Branch company institutions in Baoding, Gaoyang, and other places also recover some cloth processed by farmers from the local market and directly transport it to Zhangjiakou and Baotou in the Northwest to open up sales channels. They also supported dyeing factories in production and processing, solving the livelihoods of some workers and farmers, especially people in disaster areas, and promoting the development of production.
