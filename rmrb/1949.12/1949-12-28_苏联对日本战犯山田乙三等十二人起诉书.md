Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 27th. TASS Moscow, December 24th. The newspapers published the indictment in the case of the trial of former Japanese army personnel, accusing Yamada Otozo, Wei Zizhong Ryuji, Takahashi Takaatsu, Kawashima Kiyoshi, Nishi Toyohiko, Tang Ze Tomio, Oue Masao, Sato Haruji, Hirazakura Zensaku, Mitomo Katsuo, Kikuchi Joso, and Kurushima Shigeharu of preparing and using bacteriological weapons, which is a violation of Article 1 of the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on April 19, 1943.

For many years, imperialist Japan was the main breeding ground for aggression in the Far East.

The ruling clique of imperialist Japan, after engaging in a sinful conspiracy with Hitler Germany and fascist Italy, planned, launched, and carried out aggressive wars against peace-loving people in order to jointly establish world hegemony with Hitler Germany.

The purpose of these aggressive wars was to attempt to establish the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"—a colonial state under Japanese rule. The extreme expansionist intentions of the Japanese imperialists are manifested in the forcible annexation of large areas of territory of Japan's peace-loving neighbors to establish such a colonial state.

Imperialist Japan is the breeding ground for aggression in the Far East.

Only after the Soviet army decisively defeated the Kwantung Army and forced Japan to surrender did the Japanese invaders' aggression come to an end.

The extent of the Japanese ruling clique's aggressive desires can be seen from a series of public statements made by government leaders who determined Japanese policy. One of the main Japanese war criminals, Hashimoto Kingoro, a "thinker" of the Japanese aggressive militarist group, wrote in a paper entitled "The Sphere of Influence of the Greater East Asia Empire" published on January 5, 1942: This "sphere of influence" should include the following countries: "Japan, Manchuria, China, the Far Eastern part of the Soviet Union, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, British India, Afghanistan, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, the Philippines, and the islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans." Similarly, the so-called "Greater East Asia" map stipulated in the plans and drafts of the "General War Research Institute," which was established by the special decree of the Japanese Emperor and directly under the Japanese Prime Minister, was also determined in this way.

In their sinful aggressive plans, the Japanese imperialists considered anti-Sovietism as their main task. In the strategic plans of the Japanese warlords, the Soviet Union was often listed as the "first target." Anti-Soviet war of aggression was widely promoted among the Japanese residents. All Japanese news organizations, which were completely controlled by the Japanese government's intelligence bureau, were particularly engaged in this war propaganda.

In carrying out its criminal plan, the Japanese ruling clique carried out a series of aggressive actions: in 1931, it created the "Shenyang Incident," and the Japanese army invaded and occupied Manchuria; in 1937, the Japanese army invaded China and created the so-called "Lugouqiao Incident"; in 1938, the Japanese warlords attacked the Soviet Union in the Hassan Lake area, but were defeated by the Soviet army; in 1939, the Japanese imperialists attacked the Halhin Gol area of the Mongolian People's Republic, which was friendly to the Soviet Union, but were also defeated by the armies of the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union; at the end of 1941, the Japanese militarists dragged Japan into World War II, siding with Hitler Germany.

Only after the Soviet army decisively defeated the main striking force of Japan—the Kwantung Army concentrated in Manchuria—and caused Japan to surrender to the Allied forces, did Japan's aggression come to an end.

Events related to the Japanese imperialists have been reviewed in the international trial of major Japanese war criminals in Tokyo. The International Military Tribunal has fully confirmed that the Japanese ruling clique, together with Hitler Germany, planned, launched, and carried out aggressive wars. Japan had been actively preparing for a large-scale anti-Soviet war of aggression for many years. The court determined the fact that Japan conducted anti-Soviet aggressive wars in the Hassan Lake area in 1938 and in the Halhin Gol area in 1939. The court also confirmed that Japan entered into a criminal conspiracy with Hitler Germany and fascist Italy aimed at opposing human peace.

The court also confirmed that Japan greatly violated the laws and customs of war. This was manifested in the atrocities and inhumane treatment of prisoners of war and free residents in the occupied areas by the Japanese warlords.

The investigation into the current case has confirmed that in planning and preparing for aggressive wars against the Soviet Union and other countries, in order to achieve their goals, the Japanese imperialists intended to use on a large scale, and also partially used, the criminal tool—bacteriological warfare weapons—to exterminate humans in batches.

Organizing special forces to prepare for and conduct bacteriological warfare

The investigation confirmed that shortly after seizing Manchuria, the Japanese General Staff Headquarters and the Ministry of the Army organized bacteriological laboratories and included these laboratories in the Japanese Kwantung Army. The laboratory was headed by Shiro Ishii. Ishii Shiro was known in Japan as a thinker of bacteriological warfare, and later served as a lieutenant general medical officer. In this laboratory, the use of acute infectious disease bacteria was studied for offensive bacteriological warfare.

According to former Japanese Major General Medical Officer, defendant Kawashima Kiyoshi, according to the secret imperial decree of Emperor Hirohito, the Japanese General Staff Headquarters and the Ministry of the Army established two extremely secret agencies in Manchuria in 1935 and 1936 to prepare for and conduct bacteriological warfare. In order to maintain secrecy, one of the agencies, organized on the basis of Ishii's laboratory, was named "Kwantung Army Water Supply and Disease Prevention Bureau"; the other was called "Kwantung Army Veterinary Infectious Disease Experiment Bureau." In 1941, after Hitler Germany attacked the Soviet Union, these two agencies were renamed "Unit 731" and "Unit 100." The aforementioned Shiro Ishii was appointed as the commander of Unit 731, and Veterinary Major General Wakamatsu was appointed as the commander of Unit 100.

Two Sinful Secret Agencies

Unit 731 and Unit 100 raised thousands of people to manufacture bacteriological weapons, preparing for bacteriological warfare against the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China, using bacteria to exterminate large numbers of humans and infect livestock and crops, causing economic damage.

The staff of these units consisted of bacteriology experts and scientific and technical workers guided by the most famous bacteriologists. Unit 731 alone had three thousand people. This fact proves the scale of the work of the bacteriological units.

The Japanese military headquarters allocated a considerable amount of funds to maintain the units preparing bacteriological warfare weapons. For example, in 1939, a large military area with many laboratories and offices was established in the Pingfang Station area, 20 kilometers away from Harbin, for Unit 731 to reside in. A large amount of materials were stored, and the area around the military area was designated as a restricted area to maintain secrecy. The unit had its own airport and special test site at Andun Station. Unit 100 also had extensive housing, special equipment, and large areas of land for its use in the Mengjiatun area, ten miles south of Changchun.

Unit 731 and Unit 100 had many detachments under them. The main task of these detachments was to prepare for the practical application of the bacteriological weapons manufactured by the two units in the war. The bacteriological units and detachments were directly under the command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Kwantung Army.

In addition to the testimonies of witnesses and the confessions of the defendants, this matter is also confirmed by the order issued by Umezu Mijiro, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Kwantung Army, in December 1940, and captured by the Soviet army in Manchuria in 1945, regarding the organization and mobilization of four new detachments of Unit 731.

General Yamada Otozo, who succeeded Umezu Mijiro as Commander of the Kwantung Army and is now one of the defendants in this case, also confirmed in his confession that the bacteriological units were directly under his command.

Describing the characteristics of Unit 731, Yamada confessed: "...The purpose of organizing Unit 731 was to prepare for bacteriological warfare mainly against the Soviet Union, but also against the Mongolian People's Republic and China." According to Yamada's confession, Japan also made preparations for bacteriological warfare against other countries. Yamada also confessed that the work of Unit 100 was to manufacture bacteriological weapons for bacteriological warfare. In addition, Unit 100 "was also ordered to carry out sabotage, throwing highly contagious bacteria into pastures and water reservoirs. In this regard, Unit 100 had close contact with the intelligence department of the Kwantung Army Headquarters in its work..."

Former Japanese Kwantung Army Veterinary Captain, Veterinary Lieutenant General, defendant Takahashi Ba confessed: "The task of the 'Veterinary Epidemic Disease Unit' was to prepare for and conduct bacteriological warfare and sabotage activities. These units and their detachments systematically conducted bacteriological research, intending to find various most effective bacteria that could be used as bacteriological weapons, and to find ways to multiply them on a large scale and the technology to use them to exterminate large numbers of humans and infect livestock and crops, causing economic damage."

Unit 731 had eight sections. Only one of them (Section 3) dealt with water supply and disease prevention. However, the factories in Section 3 also manufactured shell casings for bacteriological bombs called "Ishii-style bombs." These bombs were used to scatter fleas infected with plague from airplanes. The other sections of Unit 731 were all engaged in matters related to preparing for and conducting bacteriological warfare.

The preliminary investigation materials confirmed that Section 1 specialized in researching and cultivating bacteria of plague, cholera, glanders, anthrax, typhoid and paratyphoid, and other diseases for bacteriological warfare purposes, in order to use these bacteria in bacteriological warfare. In this research process, not only animals but also living people were used for experiments. For this purpose, an internal prison was also organized to detain 300 to 400 people.

Section 2—the so-called experimental section—tested bacteriological weapons in test sites and in combat situations. Section 2 commanded a special aviation team; the aviation team had aircraft equipped with instruments and an airport at Andun Station. The section had a special department under it for cultivating and breeding fleas for spreading plague.

Section 2 manufactured special weapons for spreading bacteria: pen-style and cane-style throwers, porcelain bombs, etc. It can be seen from the equipment list of the sabotage team found in the Japanese military archives that the Japanese used pen-style throwers as standard equipment.

One of these sections was called the "Education Section." This section trained specialized cadres who knew how to use bacteriological warfare weapons for Japanese combat troops and sabotage teams.

Huge Bacteria Culturing Equipment

The equipment of Unit 731 alone could produce no less than 300 million trillion microorganisms in a few days, so that the bacterial clumps they made were measured in centimeters.

In order to prepare a large number of bacteria sufficient for bacteriological warfare, Unit 731 had a production (Section 4) section. As defendant Kawashima, the chief of this section, said, this section became a "factory" for large-scale production of various bacteria. The section was equipped with powerful and effective instruments and was divided into two departments, each of which could independently manufacture bacteria. The first department has the following main equipment: four boilers for preparing bacterial culture solution, each with a production capacity of one ton of culture solution, fourteen autoclaves for disinfecting the culture solution, each three meters long and one and a half meters in diameter. There are a total of thirty such autoclaves. Ishii, the commander of Unit 731, invented a special incubator. The first department has two rooms for cooling the culture solution. Each room can accommodate up to one hundred incubators at the same time. This department has a total of five thermostats, which can accommodate a total of 620 Ishii-style incubators. The second department has two boilers, each with a capacity of two tons, eight autoclaves, each capable of holding 60 incubators, and other equipment. The section also has special refrigerators for storing the finished "products."

According to the existing materials on the production capacity of the main equipment for culturing bacteria in Unit 731, experts have discovered that in one production cycle (lasting only a few days), the above-mentioned equipment of Unit 731 alone can produce no less than 300 million trillion microorganisms. Experts emphasized that, considering the production period, this bacterial yield should be considered very large.

This huge production volume allowed Unit 731 and Unit 100 to measure the bacterial clumps they manufactured in centimeters. This explains why the defendants talked about calculating the number of bacteria in centimeters in their confessions. In addition, it also relates to the weight of the milky thin bacterial clumps taken directly from the surface of the culture solution.

Therefore, in explaining the production capacity of Unit 731, defendant Kawashima confessed: "Based on its existing equipment and production capacity, the production section can manufacture 300 centimeters of plague bacteria per month."

Another defendant, Tang Ze, made the same confession: "The production capacity of the section preparing bacteria can be increased to 300 centimeters of plague bacteria per month, if all the equipment is activated."

Weapons of Mass Murder

Unit 731 stored 4,500 incubators, using mice and other animals to breed fleas, and could produce kilograms of plague-infected fleas in a short time. They also prepared to spread large amounts of deadly bacteria by airplanes, dropping bacteriological bombs, etc., to create terrible plagues and cause millions of people to die tragically.

As proven by investigations and confirmed by experts, all these large batches of pathogens (including plague, cholera, typhoid, and other pathogens) were for the production of bacteriological weapons for the purpose of mass slaughter of people.

Large-scale work of culturing fleas and infecting them with bacteria was also carried out in Unit 731 and its detachments. Mice and other rodents were not only cultivated by the personnel of the bacteriological units, but also by special forces dispatched by the regular forces of the Kwantung Army for the purpose of carrying out large-scale slaughter of people. These animals were used to culture fleas and infectious diseases. The scale of flea cultivation can be illustrated by the fact that Unit 731 had 4,500 incubators, which were used to cultivate fleas with rodents.

As the defendants confessed, the function of these incubators was to produce kilograms of plague-infected fleas in a short period of time. According to experts' estimates, this number is equivalent to tens of millions of fleas, all of which were specifically used as bacteriological weapons.

According to the evidence presented by witness Morita, the scale of culturing and breeding fleas can also be proven by the fact that in the 543rd detachment in Hailar alone, nearly 13,000 mice were raised in the summer of 1945.

Preliminary investigations have confirmed that Japanese bacteriological warfare units conducted similar bacteriological warfare preparations in Central and South China. Their code names were "Bo" and "Rong". Between 1941 and 1943, these units were commanded by the defendant, Major General Medical Officer Sato.

According to the defendant Sato's personal confession, the "Rong" unit had the ability to cultivate and breed huge amounts of bacteria for bacteriological warfare.

According to the defendant Yamada's confession, the Japanese Army "approved and listed on the armament list three main methods of using bacteriological weapons: spreading bacteria from the air, dropping bacteriological bombs, and finally using clandestine sabotage methods."

According to the plan of the Japanese imperialists, specially equipped aircraft, specially trained military units and sabotage groups were to spread large amounts of deadly bacteria, such as plague, cholera, scarlet fever, glanders, anthrax, and other highly infectious diseases, in the enemy's front lines and rear areas, spreading bacteria in residential areas, reservoirs, wells, grains, and livestock by all possible means.

The Japanese imperialists deliberately adopted the means of rapidly spreading deadly bacteria. In their despicable plan, they stipulated spreading infectious diseases such as plague and cholera to the army and peaceful residents. According to their plan, these infectious diseases must cause terrible epidemics and cause millions of people to die tragically. They were prepared to use this inhumane weapon that posed a great danger to the peaceful residents of belligerent and neutral countries.

Criminal Experiments on Living People

The main method of testing the effectiveness of bacteriological weapons was to systematically and on a large scale conduct inhumane and criminal experiments on living people.

These criminal experiments were carried out on Chinese patriots who were determined to be tortured to death by the Japanese military police, participants in the resistance movement against the Japanese invaders, and Soviet citizens.

According to the investigation, Japanese bacteriological unit personnel, with the approval and consent of the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, used criminal experiments to massacre people.

Defendant Yamada admitted that he had permitted the use of living people for experiments. Yamada confessed: "I...permitted such experiments, and thus in fact approved the forcible extermination of Chinese people, Russian people...sent by the Kwantung military police and my subordinate Japanese military organs for experiments."

Factory of Death

They conducted large-scale experiments on living people. How many patriotic Chinese people, guerrillas who bravely resisted the Japanese invaders in Northeast China, as well as many Soviet citizens and soldiers, and Mongolian people were used to test the effects of various deadly bacteria.

Gu Shi, who was interrogated as a witness, provided testimony regarding experiments on infecting people with typhoid fever. He confessed: "...Around 1943, I was ordered by Tabei, the chief of the first section, to participate for the first time in experiments on infecting people detained in the prison of Unit 731 with typhoid fever. I prepared a liter of sweet water, and I threw typhoid bacteria into it. Then I diluted this cup of sweet water with water and gave it to about 50 Chinese prisoners to drink. As far as I remember, they were prisoners of war. Some of them had previously received typhoid fever injections."

Defendant Kawashima Kiyoshi, when questioned about the activities of the first section of Unit 731, confessed: "Unit 731 extensively conducted experiments on living people to test the effects of various deadly bacteria. Chinese patriots and Russians in prison who were determined to be executed by the Japanese counter-intelligence agencies were the materials for these experiments. Unit 731 had a special prison for imprisoning criminals. The criminals to be experimented on were strictly controlled and isolated in this prison. In order to conceal this conspiracy, the officers and soldiers of Unit 731 called the people who underwent these experiments 'lumber'."

On the battlefield close to the front line, these inhumane experiments on living people were also carried out on target ranges with special equipment. The prisoners were first tied to iron pillars on the target range, and then the effects of various bacteriological bombs were tested on them.

Defendant Tang Ze confessed: "When experimenting on the effects of bacteria on living people under battlefield conditions, I was personally present at the target range twice. The first time I was at the target range was at the end of 1943, when ten people were brought in. They were tied to pillars that had been planted in advance, five meters apart from each other. Then electric blasting bombs were detonated 50 meters away. As a result, several of the people being experimented on were injured by bomb fragments. Afterwards, I learned that they were also infected with anthrax, because the bombs contained anthrax bacteria. The second time was in the spring of 1944, when ten people were brought in. They were tied to pillars in the same way as the first time. Then a bomb containing plague bacteria was detonated about ten meters away from those being experimented on."

Another defendant, Nishi Toyohiko, who participated in these criminal experiments at the target range near Andun Station, confessed: "In January 1945, when I was at the target range of Unit 731 at Andun Station, I witnessed Lieutenant Colonel Igari, the chief of the second section of Unit 731, along with Erki, a scientific staff member of the section, conducting experiments on infecting ten Chinese prisoners of war with gas gangrene. These ten Chinese prisoners of war were tied to pillars ten to twenty meters apart. Then they detonated bombs electrically. As a result, they were all injured by blasting bombs and infected with gas gangrene. A week later, they all died extremely miserably." The bodies of the people who were put to death were cremated in a special crematorium set up by Unit 731 near the prison. The witnesses and defendants interrogated in this case confessed to the inhumane tortures, abuses, and insults suffered by all the people who were brought into the secret chamber of the special prison of Unit 731 as "experimental materials".

Witness Kuragari confessed: "There were several laboratories on each floor, with several small rooms in the middle, where people to be experimented on were held. Lieutenant Tasaka, the squad leader, told me that these people were called 'lumber' in Unit 731. I remember very clearly that there were Russians in addition to Chinese in these prison rooms. In one prison room, I saw a Chinese woman. The people held in the prison rooms were all wearing shackles. Three Chinese people had no fingers, and some others only had the bones of their fingers. Yoshimura explained to me that this was the result of experiments on frostbite on them."

Yamagishi, the former deputy director of the Japanese concentration camp who was interrogated as a witness, confessed: "I don't remember the names of everyone who was sent to Unit 731 and killed. I only remember these names now: Soviet soldier Jimchenko. He refused to provide any information about the Soviet army. With my permission, coercive measures were taken against him. The investigator tortured him, tying his hands and feet and hanging him from the beam. However, Jimchenko did not say a word. I then decided to execute him, so I sent him to Unit 731."

Defendant Kawashima confessed: "If a prisoner still recovered despite being infected with deadly bacteria, they would still be subjected to repeated experiments, continuing until they died from the bacterial infection. The people infected were treated as research subjects for various treatments. They were still given ordinary meals. After they were completely healed, they were then used for experiments on infecting them with another bacterium. Under these circumstances, no one could survive from this factory of death."

The defendant confessed:

In Unit 731 alone, no less than 600 people died each year from inhumane experiments. No less than 3,000 people were killed by bacteria in this killing factory from 1940 to 1945.

Japanese police agencies and Japanese military authorities in Manchuria were ordered to send imprisoned Chinese and Soviet citizens to Unit 731, with the consent of the commander of Unit 731, to be used as "special materials" for so-called "investigations." In order to conceal this conspiracy, the military police's official documents gave it a special name, calling it "special transport goods."

Witness Tachibana Takeo, the former Japanese advisor to the military police of "Manchukuo," confessed: "A type of person interrogated by the special service of the military police station under my jurisdiction had to be eliminated. Among these people were guerrillas who were extremely hostile to the Japanese authorities in Manchuria. The court did not hold trials for these arrested people, because we sent them to Unit 731 to be exterminated by the bacteriological unit." Another witness, Kimura, the former adjutant in charge of the Japanese military police in Harbin, confessed during the interrogation: When Ishii, the commander of Unit 731, was talking with Kasuga, the director of the Harbin military police station, he was also present. Ishii expressed his belief that he would continue to receive arrested people as "experiments" in the future, just as in the past.

Official documents of the Japanese military police headquarters seized by the Soviet army from the Japanese archives in Manchuria confirmed that there had been so-called "special transport" of prisoners since 1939. In particular, there was Order No. 224 of Major General Shirokura, the commander of the Kwantung Army military police, regarding the "special transport" of 30 prisoners to Ishii's unit in 1939.

Defendant Kawashima Kiyoshi's confession revealed the fact of large-scale extermination of prisoners: "Every year, 500 to 600 prisoners were brought to Unit 731. I have seen how the personnel of the first section of Unit 731 received these people from the military police in groups." "Based on the information I learned from working in the unit, I can say that due to experiments, no less than 600 people died in Unit 731 every year." "During the five years that Unit 731 was stationed at Pingfang East Station (transliteration), from 1940 to 1945, no less than 3,000 people were killed due to infection with deadly bacteria passing through this killing factory. I don't know the number of people who were eliminated before 1940."

Unit 100 Committed Similar Evils

In addition to experimenting with pathogens on living people, they also experimented with highly toxic poisons and freezing living people's limbs.

Similar crimes were also committed in Unit 100. Section 6 of the second section of the unit specialized in experimenting on living people.

Witness Enoki Akizuru, a laboratory worker in the unit, stated when describing the unit's activities: "Kwantung Army Unit 100 was known as the livestock infectious disease unit, but in reality it was a bacteriological unit, because it spread and disseminated glanders, anthrax, and livestock plague bacteria that promoted livestock infectious diseases. Unit 100 used experiments on livestock and living people to test the performance of bacteria. Therefore, the unit had horses, dairy cows, and other animals, and there were also isolated living people. I only knew that there were living people because I saw them myself."

Another witness, Fukuzumi, who worked as a veterinarian in Unit 100, confessed: "Since Unit 100 was an experimental unit, its personnel included scientific workers, bacteriologists, chemists, veterinarians, and agricultural scientists. The purpose of all the work carried out in this unit was to prepare for various bacteriological wars against the Soviet Union. This unit engaged in scientific research at its headquarters and detachments, seeking methods for the large-scale use of bacteria and highly toxic poisons to destroy animals and humans on a large scale." "In order to determine the effects of these poisons, experiments were conducted on animals and living people."

Defendant Mitomo, who served in Unit 100, confessed that he personally used prisoners for inhumane experiments and killed many prisoners.

Mitomo confessed: "Here is an example: During the two weeks of August 1944, various experiments were conducted on a Russian person. His body was already very thin. Matsui instructed to kill this Russian person by injecting potassium cyanide. The Russian person died immediately after the injection. I performed the injection in the military detention room. At the beginning of September 1944, the military police shot two Russian people in front of me at the livestock burial ground, and the two people were buried there. They were shot according to Lieutenant Nakajima's instructions. They were shot because, in view of their thinness and unsuitability for further experiments, they could no longer be used for experiments."

In addition to the criminal experiments of infecting prisoners with plague and other highly infectious diseases, Unit 731 widely conducted inhumane experiments of freezing living people's limbs, forcing prisoners to put their hands and feet in special refrigerators until their limbs were frostbitten.

Witness Gu Shi confessed: "Groups of Russians, Chinese, and Mongolians, ranging in number from two to sixteen people, were brought into the open air with shackles on their feet. Using weapons to threaten them, they were forced to put their bare hands (sometimes one hand, sometimes both hands) into buckets of water, and then forced them to expose their hands, freezing them for ten minutes to two hours, depending on the temperature of the weather. When they were frostbitten, they were brought back to the laboratory in the prison."

Most of these criminal experiments ended with the limbs of the people subjected to these experiments rotting and dying. The purpose of these experiments was to find ways to prevent frostbite during planned military operations against the Soviet Union.

The Use of Bacteriological Weapons in the War Against China

While preparing for large-scale bacteriological warfare, the Japanese imperialists partially used bacteriological weapons in the war of aggression they launched against China in 1940.

In the summer of 1940, a special bacteriological dispatch team led by General Ishii, the commander of Unit 731, was sent to the Central China Theater. In the Ningbo area, Unit 731's aircraft used fleas to spread plague to enemy areas, where an epidemic plague therefore occurred.

The source of the 1940 Ningbo plague was the spreading of the disease by Japanese aircraft.

Regarding the organization of the above-mentioned dispatch team, defendant Tang Ze confessed: "In the second half of 1940, I received an order from my direct superior, Major Suzuki, to prepare 70 kilograms of typhoid bacteria and 50 kilograms of cholera bacteria. Major Suzuki explained to me the reason for doing so, saying that he was ordered by the commander of the unit, General Ishii, to manufacture bacteria. Ishii was then preparing to deploy the special dispatch team of the unit to use bacteria to fight against the Chinese army. I carried out this order. At the same time, because the personnel of the second section told me, I knew that the second section cultivated five kilograms of fleas for Ishii General's dispatch team to spread this infectious disease as spreaders of plague. In September 1940, General Ishii went to Hankou with a group of officers of the unit, and returned in December 1940. The officers who went to Hankou with General Ishii said when they returned to the unit that spreading infectious diseases with fleas had produced positive results. Due to the spread of fleas, there was an epidemic infectious disease. Major Nozaki, who participated in this dispatch team, pointed out a Chinese newspaper to me as proof. The newspaper published a paper saying that the Black Death occurred in the urban area of Ningbo. The author of the paper then reached the correct conclusion: The Japanese are responsible for the occurrence of this plague, because witnesses saw Japanese aircraft circling in this area and dropping some things at low altitude. I personally read the above article."

Defendant Nishi Toyohiko had personally seen a secret newsreel describing the activities of the Japanese bacteriological unit fighting against the Chinese army in Unit 731. He confessed: "The following shots appeared on the screen. Some special vessels were tied to the aircraft, with instructions stating: Containing fleas carrying plague germs. The shots were taken when the aircraft was flying over the enemy. Certain movements of the Chinese army and a residential area can be seen on the ground." Nishi Toyohiko then confessed: The screen showed the situation of the real bacteriological offensive and the completion of the task: "The aircraft returned to the airport. Then there were the words 'Task Completed'. Ishii got off the aircraft. The next title was 'Result'. The screen showed a Chinese newspaper and its Japanese translation. The Chinese newspaper wrote that a serious, infectious plague suddenly occurred in the Ningbo area."

In addition to the above confessions of defendants Tang Ze and Nishi Toyohiko, documents found in the archives of the Japanese Kwantung Army confirmed the fact that a special dispatch army was transported to the Central China Theater. In particular, there was Order No. 659, Bing Zi (兵字), issued by former Japanese Army Commander General Umezu on July 25, 1940: He ordered the commander of the railway troops of the Kwantung Army to transport a team of personnel from Unit 731 and special top-secret goods to Central China.

In addition, Order No. 178 issued by the commander of the Kwantung Army railway unit on July 20, 1940, regarding the implementation of the above order, was also seized. This order emphasized the special secrecy of this transportation, so it instructed not to include it in the schedule, and pointed out the transportation routes of Pingfang, Harbin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Guan and Tianjin.

In 1941, Unit 731 spread plague germs in Changde, Hunan

In 1942, they were divided into several teams to spread germs in Central China again.

In 1941, Unit 731 made an expedition to Changde area in Central China. During this expedition, Japanese aircraft scattered infectious plague fleas in the area.

In 1942, when the Japanese army withdrew from a fierce battle area in Central China, Unit 731 organized another expedition.

Regarding the preparation for this expedition, the defendant Tang Ze confessed: "The expedition to the Chinese army under the command of General Ishii was carried out in the middle of 1942. Under the order of Major Suzuki, I supervised the preparation of 130 kilograms of paratyphoid and anthrax bacteria before this expedition. As far as I know, fleas as vectors of infectious diseases were also used in this expedition. General Ishii and his troops went to Central China to engage in the expedition, when the Japanese army in Central China was withdrawing. The personnel of this expeditionary dispatch team took advantage of the army's withdrawal to spread bacteria in the abandoned areas, aiming to infect the advancing Chinese army with infectious diseases."

Another defendant, Kawashima Kiyoshi, fully confirmed Tang Ze's confession: "In July 1942, after preliminary preparations, the dispatch team was divided into several teams and went to Central China..." This time, bacteriological weapons were used on land, and this area was spread with germs according to the principles of clandestine sabotage. "The advancing Chinese army entered the infected area and was hit by bacteriological weapons."

As proven by the evidence of witness Takayuki, the chief of the intelligence section of the Japanese 30th Army Headquarters, members of bacteriological unit "A" also participated in this activity.

    这些侵略战争的目的是企图建立所谓“大东亚共荣国”——日本统治下的殖民地国家。日本帝国主义者的极端扩张主义的意图，表现在通过武力吞并爱好和平的日本邻国大片领土，以建立这样的一个殖民国家上。
    帝国主义的日本是远东侵略温床
    只有在苏军决定性地击溃了关东军迫使日本投降之后，日寇的侵略才告结束。
    从决定日本政策的政府领袖所作的一系列的公开声明中，可以看出日本统治集团的侵略欲望，达到了怎样的程度。日本主要战犯之一，日本侵略的军国主义集团的“思想家”桥本欣五郎，在一九四二年一月五日发表以“大东亚帝国势力范围”为题的论文写道：这个“势力范围”应包括下列数国：“日本、满洲国、中国、苏联的远东部分、马来亚、荷属东印度、英属印度、阿富汗、澳大利亚、新西兰、夏威夷、菲律宾和太平洋及印度洋的各岛。”同样，按照日本天皇的特别敕令而建立的直属于日本首相的“总体战研究所”，在它的计划与草案中所规定的所谓“大东亚”版图，也是这样确定的。
    日本帝国主义者在其罪恶的侵略计划中，认为反苏是主要任务。在日本军阀的战略计划中，苏联经常是被列为“第一个对象”。在日本居民中间广泛地宣传反苏掠夺战争。完全受日本政府情报局所控制的一切日本新闻机构，特别从事这种贩卖战争的宣传。
    日本统治集团在履行其犯罪计划时，进行了一系列的侵略行动：一九三一年曾制造“沈阳事件”，日军侵略满洲并占领满洲；一九三七年，日军侵略中国，制造了所谓“卢沟桥事件”；一九三八年，日本军阀在哈桑湖地区进攻苏联，但被苏军击溃；一九三九年，日本帝国主义者进攻苏联友好的蒙古人民共和国的哈尔新——葛尔河地区，但也被蒙古人民共和国和苏联的军队击溃；一九四一年末，日本军国主义者将日本卷入第二次世界大战，与希特勒德国站在一边。
    只有在苏军决定性地击溃了日本的主要突击力量——集中在满洲的关东军并引起日本向同盟国投降之后，日本的侵略才告结束。
    与日本帝国主义者相关联的事件，已在东京的日本主要战犯的国际审判中审查过。国际军事法庭已充分证实：日本统治集团与希特勒德国一道策划、发动并进行了侵略战争。日本多年中曾积极地准备大规模的反苏侵略战争。法庭确定日本在一九三八年于哈桑湖地区和一九三九年于哈尔新——葛尔河地区进行反苏侵略战争的事实。法庭也同样确认日本与希特勒德国和法西斯意大利进入了旨在反对人类和平的犯罪同谋。
    法庭也证实了日本大为违反关于战争的法律与惯例。这表现在日本军阀对战俘和占领区内自由居民的兽行和不人道的待遇上。
    关于目前一案的调查，业已证实在计划与准备反对苏联及其他国家的侵略战争时，为了达到他们的目的，日本帝国主义者曾打算大规模利用、并且也部分地利用了犯罪的工具——细菌战武器，来整批地灭绝人类。
    组织特种部队来准备和进行细菌战
    调查证实：在夺得满洲后不久，日本参谋本部和陆军省即组织了细菌实验所，并把这一实验所包括在日本关东军中。实验所由石井四郎主持。石进四郎在日本以细菌战思想家闻名，后任中将军医官。在该实验室中研究利用急性传染病细菌以进行攻势细菌战。
    据前日军少将军医被告川岛清供称；按照天皇裕仁的秘密敕令，日本参谋本部及陆军省在一九三五年和一九三六年就在满洲设立了准备和进行细菌战的两个极秘密机关。为了保守秘密，其中一个在石井的实验所的基础上组织起来的机关，即命名为“关东军部队用水供应及疾病预防局”；另一所则叫做“关东军兽类传染病试验局”。一九四一年在希特勒德国进攻苏联之后，这两个机关即改名为“第七百三十一号部队”与“第一百号部队”。上述石井四郎被任命为第七百三十一号部队长官，兽医队少将若松被任命为第一百号部队的长官。
    两个罪恶的秘密机关
    七三一部队和一百号部队，豢养数千人制造细菌武器，准备对苏联蒙古中国进行细菌战，利用细菌灭绝大批人类和传染牲畜、庄稼，造成经济损害。
    这些部队的工作人员是由细菌学专家和由受最著名的细菌学家所指导的科学与技术工作者组成。仅第七三一部队，即有三千人。这一事实证明了细菌部队工作的规模。
    日军司令部拨出颇大一笔款项来维持准备细菌战武器的部队。例如，一九三九年，即在离哈尔滨二十公里的平房车站地区，建立了一个拥有许多实验所和办公室的大军事地区，供第七三一部队居住。大批物资储蓄起来，军事区周围划为禁区，以严守秘密。该部队在安达站设有自己的飞机场和特别试验场。第一百号部队在长春以南十哩的孟家屯地区，也有广大房舍、特别装备及大片土地，供其使用。
    七三一部队与一百号部队下面辖有许多支队。这些支队的主要任务，是准备在战争中实际应用两部队所制造的细菌武器。细菌部队及支队直属日本关东军总司令管辖。
    除证人的证言与被告的口供外，此事并为前日本关东军总司令梅津美治郎在一九四○年十二月发布、而于一九四五年在满洲为苏军缴获的有关组织与调动七三一部队的四个新支队的命令所证实。
    继梅津美治郎任关东军司令，现为本案被告之一的山田乙三将军，也在其口供中证实细菌部队曾由他直接统率。
    山田在描写第七三一部队的特性时供称：“……组织七三一部队的目的，在于准备主要是对付苏联而又兼及蒙古人民共和国及中国的细菌战争。”根据山田的口供，日本也曾进行对其他国家的细菌战争的准备。山田并供称，第一百号部队的工作是制造细菌战争所用的细菌武器。此外，第一百号部队“并奉令进行破坏行为，以富于传染性的细菌投入牧场和畜水池。在这方面，第一百号部队在其工作中，与关东军司令部谍报处有密切联系……”
    前日本关东军兽医队长、兽医队中将被告高桥巴供称：“兽类流行病部队”的任务，是准备和进行细菌战争和破坏活动。这些部队及它们的支队，有计划地进行细菌学研究，意图找出可以作为细菌武器的各种最有效的细菌，并找出大规模繁殖它们的方法以及利用它灭绝大批人类和传染牲畜、庄稼，造成经济损害的技术。
    七三一部队有八个处。其中只有一个处（第三处）处理用水供应及疾病预防事宜。但是第三处的工厂也制造名叫“石井式炸弹”的细菌弹的弹壳。这些炸弹是用来由飞机上散掷染有鼠疫的跳蚤的。七三一部队的其他各处，全是在准备和进行细菌战的事宜。
    初步调查的材料证实，第一处专门为了细菌战目的而研究和培育鼠疫、霍乱、壤宜病、炭疽热病、伤寒及副伤寒与其他疾病的病菌，以便在细菌战中利用这些病菌。在这一研究过程中，被用来实验的，不仅有动物而且还有活人。为了这一目的，还组织一个内部监狱，以便拘留三百到四百人。
    第二处——所谓实验处，在试验场上并在战斗情况中试验细菌武器。第二处统辖着特种航空队；航空队拥有装着仪器的飞机并在安达站有机场。该处下辖专门培育与繁殖用于传播鼠疫的科。
    第二处制造散播细菌的特种武器：自来水笔式和手杖式的投掷器，瓷瓦器炸弹等。从在日军档案中找出的破坏小组的装备表上可以看出，日本人采用自来水笔式投掷器作为标准装备。
    这些处中有一处叫做“教育处”。该处为日军战斗部队和破坏小组训练知道如何使用细菌战武器的专门干部。
    庞大的养菌设备
    仅七三一部队的装备，几天里就能生产不下三万万亿微生物，以至用公分来计算他们制出的细菌团。
    为了大量准备足够进行细菌战所需的细菌，七三一部队设有生产（第四）处。正如该处处长被告川岛所说一样，该处成为大规模生产各种细菌的“工厂”。该处配装有效力宏大的仪器，分为两科，各科均能独立制造细菌。第一科有下列主要装备：四具准备细菌培养液的锅炉，每具均有制造一吨培养液的生产能力，十四具对培养液加以消毒的热压器，每具长三公尺，直径一公尺半。这样的热压器共有三十具。七三一部队长官石井发明特别培养器。第一科有两个冷却培养液的房间。每间可同时容纳多达一百个培养器。这一科总共有五个整温器，总共可容六百二十个石井式培养器。第二科有两个锅炉，每个容量为二吨，八个热压器，每个可容六十具培养器和其他装备。该处并有保存制成“产品”的特别冷藏器。
    根据有关七三一部队培养细菌主要设备的生产能力的现有材料，专家们已发现在一个生产周期（为时仅数日），仅七三一部队的上述装备即能生产不下三万万亿微生物。专家们强调指出，考虑到生产的期限，应该认为这一细菌产量是非常大的。
    这种巨大的生产量使七三一部队与第一百号部队用公分来计算他们制造出的细菌团。这说明了被告们在口供中为什么谈到用公分来计算细菌数量。此外，还关涉到直接从培养液浮面上取出的乳状稀薄细菌团的重量。
    因此，在说明七三一部队的生产能力时，被告川岛供称：“根据它现有的设备和生产能力，生产处每月能制造鼠疫细菌三百公分。”
    另一被告唐泽提出同样的口供：“准备细菌的一处的生产能力，能提高到月制鼠疫细菌三百公分，假如一切设备均被开动的话。”
    大规模杀人的武器
    七三一部队中存有四千五百具孵育器，用老鼠等动物繁殖跳蚤，一个短时间能制出的染了鼠疫的跳蚤以数公斤计。他们还准备用飞机、投细菌弹等方法散布大量致命的细菌，要造成可怖的瘟疫，使百万人民惨死。
    有如调查所证明和专家们所证实的，所有这些大批的病菌（其中包括鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒及其他病菌）都是为了生产细菌武器，以大规模屠杀人民的。
    在七三一部队和其支队中也进行着大规模的培养跳蚤而且将细菌传染给它们的工作。老鼠和其他啮齿类的动物不仅受到细菌部队人员的培养，而且还受到关东军正规部队为从事大规模屠杀人民的目的所派遣的特种部队的培养，这些动物是被用来培养跳蚤和传染病的。关于跳蚤培养的规模从七三一部队中存有四千五百具孵育器这点，就可得到说明，这些孵育器是以啮齿动物来培养跳蚤的。
    象被告们所供认的这些孵育器的郊能，可在一个短时间内制出数公斤染了鼠疫的跳蚤，据专家估计，这数目相当于数千万个跳蚤，这些跳蚤都专门作为细菌武器之用。
    据证人森田提出的证据，培养和繁殖跳蚤的规模，从下述事实中也可得到证明：即仅在海拉尔的第五四三号支队中，一九四五年夏季一次就豢养了近一万三千只老鼠。
    初步的调查证实，日本细菌战部队在华中及华南曾进行了类似的细菌战准备工作。它们的暗号是“波”“荣”，在一九四一和一九四三年间，这些部队是由被告少将军医官佐滕统率的。
    据被告佐滕的亲自供认，“荣”部队拥有巨大培养和繁殖细菌进行细菌战的能力。
    据被告山田的供词，日本陆军“批准了并在军备单上列入了使用细菌武器的三项主要方法：从空中散布细菌，投掷细菌弹，最后是使用暗中破坏的方法”。
    根据日本帝国主义者的计划，专门装备的飞机，专门训练的军事部队及破坏活动组，要在敌人的前线和后方散布大量致命的细菌，如象鼠疫、霍乱、猩红热、鼻疽、炭疽热、及其他烈性的传染病，以各种可能的办法在居民区、贮水池、水井、谷物和牲畜中散播细菌。
    日本帝国主义者畜意采用迅速散播致死的细菌这种手段，他们在他们卑鄙的计划中规定向军队和向和平居民散布鼠疫、霍乱等等传染病，根据他们的计划，这种传染病必须造成可怖的瘟疫流行并且使数以百万计的人民惨死。他们准备运用这种对交战国和中立国的和平居民都有极大危险的惨无人道的武器。
    对活人的罪恶实验
    测验细菌武器的效果的主要方法，就是有系统地和大规模地对活人进行惨无人道的罪恶的实验。
    这种罪恶的实验曾经施之于那些被日本宪兵机关确定要刑讯致死的中国爱国分子、反抗日本侵略者的抵抗运动的参加者以及苏联公民。
    根据调查所证明：日本细菌部队人员在日本关东军司令的认可和同意之下，曾经采用罪恶的实验来残杀人民。
    被告山田承认，他曾经准许用活人作实验。山田供认：“我……准许作这种实验，因而就实际上批准了强力消灭那些被关东宪兵机关和我属下的日本军事机关送去作实验的中国人、俄国人……。”
    死亡工厂
    他们大规模地用活人作实验，多少我国的爱国志士、在东北英勇反抗日寇的游击队员，还有许多苏联公民和战士、蒙古人民被用以测验各种致死的细菌的作用。
    作为证人而受讯的古市提供了关于对人传染伤寒症的实验的证言。他供称：“……大约在一九四三年，我奉第一处处长田部井之命第一次参加对七三一部队的监狱所拘禁的人传染伤寒症的实验。我预备了一公升的甜水，我在其中投以伤寒菌。然后我用水把这杯甜水冲开，分给约五十名中国犯人喝，就我所记得的他们是战俘，其中若干人先前曾受过预防伤寒的注射。”
    被告川岛清在被讯关于第七三一部队第一处的活动时供称：“七三一部队曾用活人广泛地进行实验，以测验各种致死细菌的作用。被日本反谍机关确定处死的关在监狱里的中国爱国分子和俄国人就是这种实验的材料。七三一部队设有监禁犯人特别的监狱，要受实验的犯人在这种监狱被严密管制和隔绝；为了要掩饰这种阴谋，七三一部队的官兵把经受这种实验的人称为‘木材’。”
    在接近战线的战地，这种对活人的惨无人道的实验也有具有特别设备的靶场上进行。先把犯人绑在靶场的铁柱上，然后在它们身上实验各种细菌弹的效果。
    被告唐泽供称：“当用活人在战地状况下实验细菌效果时，我有两次曾亲在靶场上。第一次我在靶场上是在一九四三年年底，当时有十个人被押来，他们被绑在事先栽就在柱子上，彼此相隔五米。然后用电在五十米之外爆发爆裂弹。结果，受实验的几个人被炸弹碎片炸伤，事后我知道，他们同时也受到炭疽热的传染，因为炸弹里装有炭疽热病菌。第二次是一九四四年春季，当时有十个人被押来，他们和第一次一样被绑在柱子上。然后在距离那些受实验的人约十米的地方爆发装有鼠疫细菌的炸弹。”
    另一个参加在安达站附近的靶场上作这种罪恶实验的被告西丰彦供称：“一九四五年一月间，当时我在安达站七三一部队的靶场上，我目击七三一部队第二处处长井狩中校会同该处科学人员二木对十个中国战俘传染瓦斯壤疽症的实验。这十个中国战俘都绑在相隔十米至二十米的柱子上，然后用电爆发炸弹，结果，他们都被爆裂弹炸伤，都受瓦斯壤疽病的传染，一星期后，他们全都异常悲惨地死去。”被置死的人的尸体在监狱附近七三一部队所设置的特别火葬炉中焚毁。本案中所讯问的证人和被告们供认了关于被当作“实验材料”而带进七三一部队特别监狱密室里的所有的人所受到的惨无人道的刑讯、暴行和侮辱。
    证人仓狩供称：“在每一层楼都有若干实验室，中间有几个小房间，关着要受实验的人，小队长田坂少校对我说，这些人在七三一部队里叫做‘木材’，我记得很清楚，关在这些监房里的除了中国人外，还有俄国人。在一个监房里，我看见一个中国妇女。关在监房里的人都上着脚镣。有三个中国人没有手指，另外还有一些人只有手指的骨头。芳村向我解释，这是对他们实验冻伤的结果。”
    作为证人而受讯的前日本集中营副主任山岸供认：“我不记得那些解到七三一部队而被弄死的每个人的名字。现在我只记得这几个名字。苏军兵士吉姆琴科。他一概拒绝供出关于苏军的任何情报。在我准许之下，曾对他施以强制手段。侦查官对他用刑，绑住他的手和脚吊在梁上。然而吉姆琴科一句话也不招。我于是决定处死他，因此把他送到七三一部队去。”
    被告川岛供称：“如果犯人尽管受到致死的细菌的传染而仍然痊愈，他们还免不了要受一再的实验，一直继续到他因传染细菌而死。受传染的人被当作各种治疗的研究品，他们还是进平常的饭食，在他们完全痊愈之后，他们就被跟着用来作关于传染另一种细菌的实验。在这种情况下，没有人能从这个死亡工厂里生还。”
    被告供认：
    只在七三一部队每年就有不下六百人死于惨无人道的实验，一九四○至四五年在这个杀人工厂中被用细菌杀死的不下三千人。
    日本警察机关和满洲日本军事当局奉命在与七三一部队长官取得同意之下，把被囚禁的中国人和苏联公民送到七三一部队里去，用作所谓“调查”的“特殊材料”。为了掩饰这种阴谋，宪兵官方文件中给它取个特别名称，称为“特别运送品”。
    证人前“满洲国”陆军宪兵队日本顾问立花武夫供称：“我管辖下的宪兵署特务处所审讯的一种人必须予以消灭。在这些人当中有极端仇视日本在满洲当局的游击队员们。法庭并不对这些被捕的人开庭审判，因为我们把他们送给七三一细菌部队加以消灭。”另一证人前哈尔滨日本宪兵负责人的副官木村在审讯时供认：当七三一部队长石井与哈尔滨宪兵署署长春日芳谈话的时候，他也在场，石井曾表示相信将来他将和过去一样继续得到被逮捕的人作“试验”。
    苏联军队从满洲的日本档案中所缴获的日本宪兵署的官方文件证实：自从一九三九年起，就有所谓“特别运送”俘虏的事。特别是关东军宪兵司令城仓少将关于一九三九年将三十名俘虏“特别运送”至石井部队去的第二二四号命令。
    被告川岛清的供状，表明了大规模消灭俘虏的事实：“每年有五百到六百俘虏被带到七三一部队。我见过七三一部队的第一处人员如何从宪兵队那里一群一群地收到这些人”。“根据我在该部队工作所了解的情报，我可以说，由于实验，每年几不下六百人死于七三一部队”。“在七三一部队驻扎于平房（译音）东站的五年期间，自一九四○年至一九四五年，由于通过这个杀人工厂的致命细菌的传染而杀害的不下三千人。在一九四○年以前，被消灭的人数我不知道”。
    第一百号部队同样作恶
    除了用活人实验病菌，还用活人实验烈性毒药和水冻活人四肢。
    在一百号部队中也犯有类似的罪行，该部队第二处第六科专门用活人作实验。
    该部队的实验室工作者证人烟木秋露陈述该部队的活动时称：“关东军一百号部队号称牲畜传染病部队，但实际上它是细菌部队，因为它传播和散布鼻疽、炭疽热及助长牲畜传染病的畜类瘟疫细菌。一百号部队中以对于家畜和活人的实验来试验细菌的性能，因此该部队有马匹、乳牛及其他动物，而且也有隔离起来的活人，因为我亲自看见过，我才知道有活人。”
    另一个在一百号部队中当过兽医的证人福积供认：“一百号部队因为是一个实验部队，它的人员有科学工作者，细菌学家、化学家、兽医及农业学家。这个部队中所进行的全部工作的目的是准备多样性的对苏细菌战争。这个部队在本部及其分队都从事科学研究，寻求为大批毁灭兽类和人类而大规模使用细菌和烈性毒药的方法。”“为了确定这些毒药性能的效果，就以动物和活人进行实验”。
    在一百号部队任职的被告三友供称，他亲自用俘虏作非人性的实验，杀死许多俘虏。
    三友供称：“有下面的一个例子。在一九四四年八月的两个星期当中，对一个俄国人进行了各种各样的实验。他的身体已经很消瘦，松井指示用注射＠化钾的方法把这个俄国人杀死。俄国人在注射后立即死亡。我是在军人禁闭室进行注射的。在一九四四年九月初，宪兵当着我面前在牲畜掩埋场枪毙了两名俄国人，这两个人就埋在那里。他们是按照中岛中尉的指示枪毙的。枪毙他们是因为鉴于他们的瘦弱，和不适于作进一步实验，而再不能拿他们进行实验的缘故。”
    除了以鼠疫和其他烈性传染病进行传染俘虏的罪恶实验之外，七三一部队广泛进行冰冻活人四肢的非人性实验，强迫俘虏把他们的手和脚放在特制的冰箱里，直到四肢冻伤为止。
    证人古市供称：“成群的俄国人、中国人及蒙古人，数目从两个人到十六个人不等，上了脚镣，被带到露天里，用武器威胁他们，强迫他们把光着的手（有时一只手，有时两只手）放进水桶里，然后逼着他们把显着的手露着，冻十分钟到两小时不等，看天气的温度而定，到他们被冻坏了的时候，再带回监狱的实验室。”
    这些罪恶的实验大都以受这种实验的人的四肢烂掉和死亡来结束。这些实验的目的是在计划中的对苏军事行动期间，寻求防止四肢冻坏的办法。
    对中国战争中细菌武器的使用
    日本帝国主义者一方面准备大规模的细菌战，同时在他们对中国发动的侵略战争中已经在一九四○年部分地使用细菌武器。
    在一九四○年夏天，七三一部队长石井将军率领的特别细菌派遣队曾被派至华中战区。在宁波地区，七三一部队的飞机利用跳蚤把鼠疫散布到敌人地区，那里因此发生了流行性鼠疫。
    一九四○年宁波鼠役的来源是日本飞机散布的
    被告唐泽关于上述派遣队的组织情况供认：“在一九四○年的下半年，我从我的直接上司铃木少校那里得到准备七十公斤伤寒菌和五十公斤霍乱菌的命令。铃木少校向我解释这样作的原因说，他奉部队长石井将军的命令制造细菌。石井当时正准备布置该部队的特别派遣队使用细菌对中国军队作战。我执行了这项命令。同时因为第二处的人员告诉我，我知道第二处为石井将军的派遣队培养了五公斤跳蚤，作为鼠疫的散布者散布这种传染病。在一九四○年九月，石井将军曾与该部队一批军官同去汉口，在一九四○年十二月返回。与石井将军同往汉口的军官们返回部队时说，利用跳蚤散布传染病产生了积极效果。由于跳蚤的散布，发生了流行性传染病。参加这个派遣队的野崎少校把一份中文报纸指给我作为证明，那张报纸登载着一篇论文说，黑死病在宁波城区发生。论文作者继而达到了正确的结论：日本人对此次鼠疫的发生是要负责任的，因为目击者曾看见日本飞机在这块地区盘旋并且低空投下一些东西。我亲自读过上面这篇文章。”
    被告西丰彦曾亲自看到过描写在七三一部队中，与中国军队作战的日本细菌部队之活动的秘密新闻片，他供称：“银幕出现了下面这几个镜头，有些特殊的器皿系在飞机上，上有说明书称：内有带着鼠疫病菌的跳蚤。镜头是飞机在敌方上空飞行时摄下的。可以看见地面上中国军队某些运动和一片居民区。”西丰彦继而供称：银幕上映出真正的细菌进攻和任务完成的情形：“飞机回到机场。接着是‘任务达成’的字样。石井从飞机上下来。下一个标题是‘结果’。银幕照出中国报纸及其日文译文。中国报纸上写着严重的、传染性的鼠疫突然在宁波地区发生”。
    除被告唐泽和西丰彦的上述供状外，在日本关东军档案中所发现的文件证实了往华中战区运送特别派遣军的事实。特别是发现了前日本陆军司令梅津大将一九四○年七月二十五日兵字第六百五十九号命令：他命令关东军铁路部队司令将七三一部队之一队人员和特种极密的货物运至华中。
    此外还搜获关东军一七八铁道部队长于一九四○年七月二十日所发出的关于执行上述命令的命令。这个命令强调这次运输的特别秘密，因此建设不要把它列入班次，并且指出平房、哈尔滨、沈阳、上海、固安和天津的运输路线。
    一九四一年七三一部队在湖南常德散布鼠疫菌
    一九四二年他们又分成数队到华中散布病菌
    一九四一年，七三一部队远征华中的常德地区。在这次远征中，日机在该地区散放传染性鼠疫的跳蚤。
    一九四二年，当日军从华中某激战地区撤退时，七三一部队又组织了一次远征。
    被告唐泽对于准备此次远征一事供称：“在石井将军统率下的对中国军队的远征，是在一九四二年中进行的。在铃木少校命令之下，我在此次远征之前监督准备了一百三十公斤的副伤寒和炭疽热的细菌。据我所悉，在此次远征中也使用了作为传染病媒介的跳蚤。石井将军及其部队开往华中从事远征，当时的华中日军正在撤退。这一远征派遣队的人员利用军队的撤退，便在弃守的地区散布细菌。旨在使前进的中国军队染上传染病。”
    另一个被告川岛清完全证实了唐泽的供词：“一九四二年七月，在进行初步准备之后，派遣队即分成数队赴华中……。”这一次的细菌武器是在陆上使用的，这一个地区被按照秘密破坏活动的原则，散布了病菌。“前进的中国军队进入传染区而且受到细菌武器的打击”。
    正如证人日本第三十军军部情报处处长高雪的证据所证明的一样，细菌部队“Ａ”队的队员也参加了此次活动。
