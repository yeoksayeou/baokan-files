Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th—The Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Deng Yingchao, delivered a report on "Asian Women's Struggle for National Independence, People's Democracy, and World Peace" at the Second Plenary Session of the Asian Women's Congress today. The report was divided into six issues. Deng Yingchao first explained that the Asian nations are nations with a long cultural history. Due to the plunder and persecution by imperialist bandits, the Asian people, especially Asian women, have fallen into a tragic state of slavery. However, the Asian people and Asian women are by no means submissive slaves. They have been and are constantly fighting heroically for national independence and people's democracy. In the struggle against Japanese imperialists and the current imperialist groups headed by US imperialists and their lackeys, the role played by Asian women is very important. Today, in many Asian countries, the armed struggle for national independence and people's democracy has become or is increasingly becoming the main form of people's struggle, and the women's democratic movement has been or is increasingly combining with the armed struggle, becoming a powerful complement to the armed struggle. China's experience tells us that only by resolutely opposing armed counter-revolution with armed people can the people of oppressed nations in colonies and semi-colonies gain freedom and liberation. For centuries, the Asian people and Asian women have been unyielding in their struggle for national independence, people's democracy, and lasting peace, and now they have gained rich fruits of victory. The great victory of the Chinese people has further encouraged the struggles of the people in colonies and semi-colonies around the world.

Regarding the main tasks of Asian women in the future, Deng Yingchao pointed out: Women in all unliberated colonies and dependencies should unite closely with all the people, that is, under the leadership of the working class, unite the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, revolutionary intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie, establish a national united front, and persist in the struggle to achieve the complete liberation of the nation and the establishment of a people's democratic government. Women in countries that have been liberated should be very concerned about the suffering of their sisters in oppressed countries and use all means to support their liberation struggles. At the same time, we must unite more closely with all peace-loving countries and people around the world. We must resolutely support the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and we will always unite closely under the banner of the Women's International Democratic Federation and fight together with democratic women all over the world.

Deng Yingchao's report lasted for two hours. After the report, representatives from various countries held discussions. Today's speakers included: Amita Devi, representative from India; Masin Farroqi, representative from Iran; and Park Jung-ae, representative from Korea. Each representative unanimously condemned the imperialists' cruel persecution of the people and women of their countries, and firmly expressed their determination to unite around the Women's International Democratic Federation and fight against imperialism and its lackeys.

At today's meeting, Shi Liang, Minister of Justice of the Central People's Government, read a congratulatory letter from Song Qingling, Vice-Chairman of the Central People's Government, to the conference. British guest Mrs. Marian Ramelson, Czech guest Anna Hordirov, representatives from Xinjiang, the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions presented gifts, banners, and messages to the conference.

　　亚洲妇代会议举行二次大会
  　邓颖超作重要报告
    指出今后亚洲妇女的主要任务
  　印度伊朗朝鲜代表痛斥帝国主义罪行
    【新华社北京十一日电】中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席邓颖超在今日亚洲妇女代表会议第二次大会上作了关于“亚洲妇女为民族独立、人民民主与世界和平而斗争”的报告。报告共分六个问题。邓颖超首先说明亚洲各民族是具有悠久文化历史的民族。由于帝国主义强盗们的掠夺和迫害，亚洲人民特别是亚洲妇女沦于悲惨的奴隶地位。但是，亚洲人民和亚洲妇女决不是顺从的奴隶，他们曾经和正在不断地为民族独立和人民民主而英勇斗争。在抵抗日本帝国主义者和现在的反对以美帝国主义者为首的帝国主义集团及其走狗的斗争中，亚洲妇女所起的作用是非常重要的。今天在许多亚洲国家里，要求民族独立与人民民主的武装斗争已经或正在日益成为人民斗争的主要形式，妇女的民主运动也已经或正在日益和武装斗争结合起来，成为武装斗争的有力配合。中国的经验告诉我们：只有坚决地以武装的人民来反对武装的反革命，殖民地半殖民地被压迫民族的人民才能得到自由和解放。几个世纪以来亚洲人民和亚洲妇女不屈不挠为争取民族独立，人民民主与持久和平而斗争，到了现在，已经获得了丰富的胜利果实。中国人民的伟大胜利，更鼓舞了全世界殖民地半殖民地人民的斗争。
    关于今后亚洲妇女的主要任务，邓颖超指出：在所有尚未解放的殖民地和附属国里的妇女们，应该与全体人民紧紧地团结在一起，即在工人阶级的领导之下，团结农民阶级、小资产阶级、革命的知识分子及民族资产阶级，建立民族的统一战线，坚持斗争，以争取民族的彻底解放和人民民主政权的建立。在已经解放了的国家里的妇女们，要十分关心那些被压迫国家姊妹们的痛苦，并且用一切的办法来支援她们的解放斗争。同时我们还必须和全世界一切爱好和平的国家与人民更加亲密地团结起来，我们要坚决地拥护以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，我们并永远紧紧地团结在国际民主妇女联合会的旗帜下，和全世界民主妇女共同奋斗。
    邓颖超报告历时两小时，报告完毕后，各国代表进行讨论。今天发言的计有：印度代表阿米塔·台维，伊朗代表玛辛·法洛基，朝鲜代表朴正爱。各代表一致痛斥帝国主义者对于她们国家的人民和妇女的残忍迫害，并坚决表示团结在国际民主妇联周围，为反对帝国主义及其走狗而斗争。
