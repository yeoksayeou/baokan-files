Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 24th: A unit of our People's Liberation Army, with a 280-li long-distance raid, captured Zhanjiang City, the last stronghold of the Kuomintang bandit army in Leizhou, on the 19th. The entire rearguard of the fleeing bandits, the 151st Division and three battalions from the 53rd Division of the 62nd Army, were wiped out. The People's Liberation Army swiftly seized the docks, cutting off the enemy's escape route by sea, and then encircled and annihilated them separately. The bandit army, relying on the support of three warships in the port, stubbornly resisted from buildings, but was ultimately annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in several buildings such as the Zhanjiang City Post Office, the Municipal Government, and the Customs. In this battle, in addition to the killed and wounded, more than 800 bandit soldiers below the battalion commander level were captured. Zhanjiang City was previously liberated on October 15th with the uprising of some personnel from the Kuomintang 62nd Army headquarters and the coordinated attack of the People's Liberation Army Yuegui Border Column. This is the second liberation.
Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 23rd: The People's Liberation Army liberated Longzhou, an important border town in Guinan, on the 19th, and Chongshan County on the same day, eliminating two companies of the remnant bandit army of the 87th Division. Longzhou is located in the upper reaches of the Zuojiang River and is a transportation hub between China and Vietnam. The waterway along the Zuojiang River northeast leads to Nanning, and steamships can pass all year round. There are highways to the three key passes of Zhennanguan, Ping'erguan, and Shuikouguan.
