Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 20th: Since the liberation of Luxian County, an important town in Southern Sichuan, on the 3rd of this month, order in the entire city has been rapidly restored. The Military Control Commission was officially established and began operating on the 15th. The former 23rd Ordnance Factory, the Luxian County Power Plant, the flour mill, and other factories have continued to operate without damage due to the workers' active protection of the plants. The "People's Volunteer Repair Team," organized by about 100 people, including dock workers, rickshaw pullers, students, and teachers, is actively repairing bridges and roads, and a portion of them went to Longchang on the 13th to work.
