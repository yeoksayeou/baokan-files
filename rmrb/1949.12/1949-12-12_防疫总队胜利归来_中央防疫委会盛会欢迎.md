　　Anti-Epidemic Task Force Returns Victorious
  　Central Anti-Epidemic Committee Holds Grand Welcoming Ceremony
    [Our Newspaper] The Central Anti-Epidemic Task Force has returned victoriously after completing its anti-epidemic mission in Chahar Province. The Central Anti-Epidemic Committee held a grand welcoming ceremony on the 10th. Over 800 representatives from the Anti-Epidemic Task Force and various Beijing municipal health organizations attended. Li Dequan, Minister of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, Vice Minister He Cheng, and Zhu Lian, Director of the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee Office, spoke, pointing out that the rapid eradication of the plague in Chahar Province not only relieved the serious threat to the four million people of Chahar Province but also protected the safety of the two million people in the new China's capital, enabling the central leadership and some great international conferences to proceed with their work normally. Subsequently, Jiang Yaode, captain of the Anti-Epidemic Task Force, and Jiang Tao, deputy captain, gave speeches in response. Guan Fuyi, from the First Midwifery School, spoke about her experiences participating in the anti-epidemic work. The conference also distributed award banners and commemorative medals and took group photos.
