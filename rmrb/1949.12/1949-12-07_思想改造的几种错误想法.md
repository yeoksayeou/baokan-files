　　Several Erroneous Ideas About Ideological Remolding
　　Zhang Fan
　　Today, as the War of Liberation approaches national victory, a high tide of studying Marxism-Leninism is sweeping across the vast liberated areas. Intellectuals are universally demanding to participate in the revolution, to make progress, and to thoroughly remold themselves, and are enthusiastically participating in various revolutionary schools to study. This is naturally a very good phenomenon. However, many people among them have some erroneous ideas about the work of remolding their own ideology. According to what I have seen, the more serious obstacles to progress are the following:

　　Some people are approaching ideological remolding with the mindset and attitude of a patient entering a hospital. They think that everything should be left to the "doctor" to arrange. If they need an injection, they get an injection; if they need surgery, they get surgery. They don't care about anything themselves. They just need to endure the pain and suffering, and after a certain period of time, they will suddenly recover, feeling extremely relaxed and happy. This view of the ideological remolding process as a passive treatment, with everything determined by external forces, is completely wrong. People with this kind of thinking cannot remold themselves well because they have not recognized and grasped the most basic characteristic of ideological remolding, which is that the decisive factor for the success of ideological remolding is oneself, not anyone else. Because the process of ideological remolding is the process of internal struggle within one's own thinking, that is, using the proletarian ideological viewpoint to analyze, criticize, and defeat various non-proletarian ideological viewpoints. This struggle is painful because the one undertaking the task of attack is oneself, and the object being struggled against is also oneself. One is the main force in this struggle, and others can only play a role in enlightening and helping. Without oneself, this struggle cannot be started, and no one else can replace oneself in carrying out ideological struggle. "Marxism-Leninism is a medicine; if you swallow it reluctantly, all problems will be solved." This idea is wrong; Marxism-Leninism is a weapon of struggle. You must master this weapon and use unparalleled courage and determination to wage an irreconcilable struggle against your old ideas and old viewpoints in order to truly solve your own ideological problems. It is impossible to solve problems by taking a passive and negative attitude like a patient entering a hospital to carry out ideological remolding.

　　Some people think that ideological remolding is as easy as "in the blink of an eye, a hen turns into a duck." After listening to a few big lectures, having a few discussions at discussion meetings, and spending a few weeks, they will become a new person. This idea is a typical reflection of the petty bourgeoisie's illusions and impatience, and it does not recognize another basic characteristic of ideological remolding: it is a long-term and painful process of struggle. Because our old ideas and old viewpoints have been formed over a long period of time while standing on a certain class position and under the deception and concealment of the reactionaries, they have a stubborn strength. To thoroughly eliminate the old ideological viewpoints and replace them with the proletarian ideological viewpoint, it is impossible without a long-term, painful ideological struggle and experiencing various tests. People who fantasize about being able to remold their thinking in a very short period of time easily become disappointed and discouraged when they find that they are still the same or are not making rapid progress, and they become afraid of wavering when they experience the pain of ideological struggle. Therefore, if you do not have the courage and preparation for a long-term, arduous struggle and facing various tests in your mind, it is impossible to persist in ideological remolding.

　　Some people vaguely know that ideological remolding is a long-term and painful process of struggle, but they have the following idea: since ideological remolding cannot be accomplished overnight and must go through various tests, those who seem to be making progress now may not be making progress in the future; similarly, those who are behind now may not be worse than others in the future, so it doesn't matter if they are a little behind now, let's take it slowly. It is very wrong to use this statement to cover up one's own backwardness and to defend one's own lack of progress. It blocks the path to progress. Because it is very clear that if you push everything to the future and do not seize the present to actively remold yourself, then no matter how long the period, remaining the same is still remaining the same. I think that this struggle of ideological remolding is just like an armed uprising, requiring that we maintain an active attack at all times and gain victories, large or small. Without such tense and active action, this struggle will be completely defeated.

　　There are also some people, and this is more common, who have the idea of remolding for the sake of remolding. They recognize the transition from the arrival of the new society and the death of the old society, and they deeply feel that if they do not remold themselves well, they will lag behind in the new society. In particular, seeing that friends who were originally similar to themselves have made leaps and bounds of progress, they are stimulated and become active, which is the demand for ideological remolding driven by a competitive spirit. It cannot be denied that this idea has its progressive significance, but it is not enough to stay at this stage. The purpose of this kind of learning is individualistic, for the sake of preventing oneself from falling behind, not for the sake of training oneself to be able to serve the people well, and it does not recognize that studying in a revolutionary school is itself a revolutionary task, and only by studying well can one guarantee working well. It is impossible to study Marxism-Leninism and remold oneself from an individualistic standpoint because only by standing on the proletarian standpoint can one well accept the truth of Marxism-Leninism and well remold oneself. The most basic condition for ideological remolding is a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm.

### 思想改造的几种错误想法

　　思想改造的几种错误想法
    张  帆
    在解放战争接近全国胜利的今天，广大的解放地区掀起了学习马列主义的高潮，知识分子普遍要求参加革命，要求进步，要求澈头澈尾改造自己，纷纷参加各种革命学校学习。这自然是很好的现象。但其中也有很多人对改造自己思想这个工作存在着一些错误的观念，据我所见到的，比较严重的阻碍进步的有这么几种：
    有人是怀着病人进医院这样的心情和态度，来进行思想改造的。一切只听任“大夫”摆布就行，得打针就打针，得开刀就开刀，自己就万事不管，只要能忍苦熬痛，经过若干时日便霍然痊愈，轻松愉快之至。这种把思想改造过程看作一种被动的，一切决定于外力的治疗是完全错误的。有这样思想的人是不能很好的改造自己的，因为他没有认识和掌握思想改造最基本的一个特点，那就是：思想改造成功的决定因素是自己，而不是任何旁人。因为思想改造的过程，就是自己思想内部斗争的过程，也就是以无产阶级的思想观点分析、批判，战胜各种非无产阶级的思想观点的过程。这斗争是痛苦的，因为担当进攻任务的是自己，被斗争的对象也正是自己。自己是这个斗争的主力，旁人只能起启发帮助的作用。撇开了自己，这个斗争是闹不起来的，任何旁人都不能代替自己进行思想斗争。“马列主义是一服药，硬着头皮吞下去，就什么问题都解决。”这想法是不对的；马列主义是一种斗争的武器，必须掌握了这个武器以无比的勇敢和坚毅和自己的旧思想旧观点作不调和的斗争，才能真正解决自己的思想问题。以病人进医院那样被动消极的态度去进行思想改造是不能解决问题的。
    有人以为思想改造是“眼睛一霎，老母鸡变鸭”那么轻而易举的事。听上几回大课，讨论会上扯过几阵子，几个礼拜功夫就会变成一个新人。这种想法正是典型的小资产阶级的空想和急性病的反映，没有认识到思想改造另一个基本特点：它是一个长期而痛苦的斗争过程。因为我们的旧思想旧观点是长期站在一定的阶级地位，以及在反动派的蒙蔽欺骗下造成的，它有着顽强的力量，要彻底清除旧的思想观点代之以无产阶级的思想观点，没有长期的痛苦的思想斗争和经历各种考验是不可能。幻想在很短时期内就能改造自己思想的人，发现自己依然原封不动或进步不快就容易失望灰心，经历到思想斗争的痛苦时就害怕动摇。所以，进行思想改造如果在思想上没有长期艰苦斗争和正视各种考验的勇气和准备是无法坚持下去的。
    有人笼统的知道了思想改造是长期而痛苦的斗争过程这句话，但却有了这样的想法：既然思想改造并非一蹴而就，而且还要经过各种考验，眼前显得进步的将来就未必进步；同样，眼前落后的也未必将来不如人，所以现在落后些没关系，慢慢来吧。以这样的说法来掩饰自己的落后，替自己的不进步辩护，是很错误的，是给自己堵塞了进步之路。因为这是很明白的：把一切推向将来，不抓紧目前积极改造自己，那么无论经过多么长远的时期，原封不动依然是原封不动。我以为思想改造这个斗争，简直跟武装起义一样，要求每时每刻保持主动的攻击，获得或大或小的胜利，没有这样紧张和积极的行动，这个斗争是会一败涂地的。
    还有人，而且是比较普遍的，对思想改造抱着为改造而改造的想法。他们认识了新社会的到来和旧社会的死亡这个转变，深深觉得如果不好好改造自己，在新社会就会落伍。特别是见到原来跟自己差不多的朋友飞跃的进步了，刺激得自己也积极起来，这是好胜心所驱使的思想改造的要求，这是一般知识分子开始改造自己时常有的想法。不能否认，这种想法虽有其进步意义的，但停留在这一阶段上却也是不够的。这种学习的目的是个人主义的，为是使自己不致落伍，并非为了锻炼自己能很好的为人民服务，没有认识到进革命学校学习本身就是一种革命的任务，只有学习得好，才能保证工作得好。站在个人主义的立场而学习马列主义和改造自己是不可能的，因为只有站在无产阶级的立场才能很好的接受马列主义的真理，很好的改造自己。思想改造最基本的条件是高度的革命热情。
