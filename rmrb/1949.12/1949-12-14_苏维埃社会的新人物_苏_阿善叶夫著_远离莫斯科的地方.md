　　New Characters of Soviet Society
    ——On V. Azhayev's "Far From Moscow"
    By Su Gailingna Koliesnikova
    The publication of Vasily Azhayev's novel "Far From Moscow" was a major event in the literary world last year.

    The book has been a great success since its first appearance. Readers across the country held meetings to discuss this sensational and brilliant work that has captivated all regions of the Soviet Union. Every day, the author received numerous letters and telegrams from all over the Soviet Union, inviting him to give speeches at reader gatherings. Many libraries have more than a hundred copies of "Far From Moscow" on their shelves, but this is far from meeting the needs of readers. Although nearly ten thousand copies of the book have now been printed, the demand is still far from being met.

    "Far From Moscow" is an extremely moving book, recounting the story of installing an oil pipeline through the swampy great forests and 20,000-meter-long ditches in the most critical moments of the Great War, close to the enemy's border. At that time, oil was urgently needed to supply ships and railway transport in the Far East. Thanks to the heroic efforts of the construction workers, the pipeline was finally completed within the specified time.

    Welding craftsmen, stimulated and inspired by the example of the industrious Stakhanovite Umari Magomet, lay on the ice in order to speed up the welding of oil pipes, descended into the freezing straits wearing diving suits, and worked in the trenches made by drilling through the frozen ground using the method invented by engineer Topolev.

    The leaders of this massive project—Party organizer Shalkind, Construction Minister Batmanov, chief engineer Balei, and his assistant, young engineer Koptsev, and the rest of the staff—shared all the difficulties and hardships of working in such arduous conditions. They went to the most important work areas, spent the night by campfires in the woods, and walked tens of thousands of meters through the damp and low-lying great forests. Their tireless energy and cheerful mood vibrated the emotions of the weary and inspired those who lacked confidence.

    Engineer Topolev, an older expert, was not confident when he saw the new measures. He considered the plan to install the oil pipeline within twelve months to be a fantastical decision. But this idea was gradually dispelled by the normal progress of the work speed, and he became as enthusiastic as Batmanov, Shalkind, Balei, Koptsev, and the rest.

    Page after page, the author reveals vivid scenes of active and creative labor, something that is only possible in Soviet society. The spirit of self-sacrifice shown by the construction workers in their work is precisely the characteristic of the majority of Soviet people who selflessly devote themselves to the work in progress.

    Although the story takes place in the rear, the reader can see that, during the Patriotic War, the front and the rear were united in the same camp.

    With extremely refined strokes, the author allows us to clearly see the Bolshevik leadership, which he calls the Bolshevik organizational technique.

    When Batmanov arrived in the Far East, the construction work was behind schedule. Former engineer Grabsky and Topolev believed that the work could not be completed in at least three years, but Batmanov repeatedly pointed out that the work could be completed. He studied his entire staff and placed each person in the work best suited to them. Batmanov gradually and persistently shortened the dates set by his predecessors, and he urged the workers to strive to improve their skills and remove all difficulties that might hinder their progress. Because of the Communist Party's organization represented by Party organizer Shalkind—a resolute and far-sighted man—Batmanov's influence was even greater.

    Chapter after chapter, we see the development of the moral qualities of the characters.

    Alexei Koptsev, a young Communist Party member, initially fiercely opposed being sent to that remote area when he believed that his duty should be on the front line. However, when he participated in the work of installing the oil pipeline, he realized that, for the Soviet people, there was not much difference between the front and the rear during the war. Balei, although outwardly he seemed like a Bolshevik, was not a Party member, and he was wholeheartedly focused on his work. Previously, he had thought that he was not completely prepared to join the Party. However, after Comrade Stalin's historic speech on November 6, 1941, Balei felt that he could not remain outside the Party for a moment longer. Engineer Topolev, who had previously thought that actively participating in public affairs activities contradicted scientific work, also became so interested in the work that, regardless of his age, he went to the most remote work areas to personally supervise the installation of the oil pipeline under the frozen straits, while constantly working to further improve the work process.

    Azhayev's novel is such a book, in which we see the present illuminated by the brilliance of the future. Because it reflects the thoughts and feelings of the Soviet people, it so deeply moves the Soviet reader.

    It gives the reader a picture of modern Soviet society, pointing out its unique strength, due to the Soviet people's boundless loyalty and love for their motherland. In the Soviet center and in the areas far from Moscow, they are working selflessly for their future. (Jiang Hong, abridged translation from "Soviet Women")

　　苏维埃社会的新人物
    ——苏·阿善叶夫著“远离莫斯科的地方”
    苏·盖林娜科利斯尼可伐  著
    华西里·阿善叶夫所著小说“远离莫斯科的地方”的出版，是去年文学界的一件大事情。
    这书从它的初次出现起就获得了极大的成功。全国各处的读者都开会讨论这部轰动苏维埃各区域的天才著作。每天，作者收到从苏维埃各地寄来的大批邀请给读者集会作演讲的书函和贺电。许多图书馆的书架上放着一百多本“远离莫斯科的地方”，但远是不能满足读者的需用。虽然本书现在已经印行了将近一万本，但仍然是远不及需求的数量。
    “远离莫斯科的地方”是一本极其动人的书，记述在大战中最危急的时候，在紧临敌人边境的地方，穿过卑湿的大森林和二万米长的水沟装置油管道的故事。当时，石油是急迫的需要去供给远东的船舶和铁路运输用，感谢修建工人们的英勇行为，油管线终于在规定的时间内完成了。
    电焊工匠们，受了不辞辛劳的斯达哈诺夫运动者乌玛里·马戈梅特榜样的刺激和鼓舞，为了增快焊接油管的速度，全身躺卧在冰上，穿了游沪衣下降到凝冰的海峡底下，在用工程师托波里夫发明的方法打穿冻结的地面所做成的壕沟里工作。
    这件巨大工程的领导者们——共产党组织工作者沙尔金德，建设部长巴特曼诺夫，总工程师鲍莱兹和他的助理，青年工程师柯甫肖夫，和其余的工作人员们共同分担在这样艰苦条件下工作的一切艰难和困苦。他们到最重要的工作部门去，在树林中火堆旁边过夜，经过潮湿而低下的大森林，走几万米远的路程。他们的不倦的精力和愉悦的心情，震发了疲困者的情绪，激励了没有信心的人们。
    工程师托波里夫，一个年老的专家，他不能自信的见到了这新的措施。他认为在十二个月内装完油管线的计划是一个狂幻的决定。但他这种想法逐渐地被工作速度的正常进行所消除了，并且，他也变得和巴特曼诺夫、沙尔金德、鲍莱兹、柯甫肖夫以及其余的人同样的热心了。
    一页又一页的，作者表露了只有在苏联社会里才可能有的一种积极创造的劳动的生动画面。修建工人们在工作中表现的不顾自己的牺牲精神，正是那些忘我地投身于正在进行着的工作中的大部分苏联人所具有的特征。
    故事的情节虽然发生在大后方，然而读者可以看到，在爱国战争中，前方和后方是团结在同一个营垒中间的。
    用极精炼的笔法，作者让我们清晰地看到布尔塞维克的领导，那就是他称为布尔塞维克组织技术的。
    当巴特曼诺夫到远东的时候，建筑工作的进行已落在预定计划的后面了，前工程师格拉布斯基和托波里夫认为这工作至少在三年内不能完成，但是巴特曼诺夫一再指出来工作是可以完成的。他研究他的全体工作人员，并且把每个人安置在他最适合的工作上，巴特曼诺夫逐渐而又坚持地缩短了他的前任者所限定的日期，他劝导工人们努力于改进他们的技术，解除足以阻碍他们前进的一切困难。由于后面有党组织者沙尔金德——一个刚毅而有远见的人，所代表的共产党的组织，使得巴特曼诺夫的影响更加扩大了。
    一章又一章的，我们看到人物的道德品质的发展。
    亚历克赛·柯甫肖夫，一个年青的共产党员，最初，当他认为他的责任应该在前方火线上的时候，激烈地反对被遣送到那辽远的地区去。但是，当他参加到装安油管线的工作中时，他认识到：对于苏联人民来说，战时在前方和后方是没有多大分别的。鲍莱兹，虽然外表上看来象一个布尔塞维克，然而他并不是一个党员，他全心全意地专注于他的工作。以前他曾经想过，他还不完全预备加入党。可是，在斯大林同志一九四一年十一月六日的那次有历史意义的演说发表后，鲍莱兹感到他一刻也不能再停留在党外了。工程师托波里夫以前也认为积极参与公共事业的活动与科学工作是相矛盾的，现在也变得对这工作这样的有兴趣了，不顾他的年老，他到最远的工作地区去，亲自监督在冰冻的海峡底下装安油管，同时不断的工作着，使工作过程得以更趋完善。
    阿善叶夫的小说是一部这样的书，在那些书中，我们看到为未来的光辉所照耀着的现在。因为它反映了苏联人民的思想和感情，所以，它是这样深切的感动苏维埃读者。
    它给了读者一幅现代苏维埃社会的图影，指出他的唯一的力量，由于苏维埃人民对他们祖国的无限忠诚与热爱。在苏维埃中心和远离莫斯科地区的人们，为着他们的将来，他们都不顾一切地工作着。（江虹节译自“苏维埃妇女”）
