Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th: The National Agricultural Production Conference victoriously concluded on the 20th. The conference lasted thirteen days. Before the closing, Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, Li Shucheng, gave a summary report. Minister Li pointed out that the achievements of this conference were: further understanding the basic situation of national agricultural production, stipulating the general policy of restoring production as the main focus for 1950, formulating a general plan to increase grain production by 10 billion jin, plant 50 million mu of cotton, and produce 1.3 billion jin of ginned cotton, and clearly proposing that various regions can formulate requirements for the restoration and increased production of major special export crops according to local conditions.

Regarding the standard for the 1950 grain and cotton production increase plan, Minister Li said: The requirement to increase grain production by 10 billion jin (raw grain) next year is based on the current production level, that is, the level of water conservancy, cultivation, fertilization, and production technology, and to increase production through subjective efforts; it does not depend on good or bad weather. If the weather next year is the same as this year, this number should still be achieved. If the weather next year is better than this year, the increase in production must exceed 10 billion jin.

Minister Li asked all regions to ensure the implementation of the plan and proposed the following specific implementation methods and steps: First, strengthen investigation and research and organizational work. All regions must formulate specific plans suitable for local conditions under the overall policy plan, revise them from the bottom up, and formulate specific implementation methods. To make the plan more practical and specific and to deepen the leadership of production, investigation and research must be strengthened. In the old liberated areas, economic zones can be divided, and investigations of typical villages and typical households can be organized; in the new liberated areas, investigations can be conducted through land reform and methods of reforming burdens. After the plan is formulated, the most important issue is organizational work. To this end, we must first carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization work, implement the policy of rewarding production, advocate getting rich through labor, further develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement on a voluntary basis, and mobilize large numbers of women to participate in agricultural production.

Second, extend technological improvements to farmers. All rural workers must take leading farmers to improve technology as their regular and important task; all agricultural technology institutions and agricultural scientists should conduct experimental research based on the needs of farmers' production and their own conditions, and cooperate with local administrative leading organs to deepen into the masses, improve the existing production methods and experience, and widely apply new technologies.

Third, provide farmers with necessary investment and loans, but mainly rely on and mobilize the strength of the masses to develop rural credit lending and overcome the idea of ​​solely relying on state loans. In addition, attention should be paid to attracting private capital to invest in agricultural construction.

Fourth, in disaster areas, it is necessary to organize and assist the masses in carrying out a production self-rescue movement, relying on developing sideline businesses, transportation and sales, and other methods to overcome the famine, and strive to accumulate food. At the same time, accumulate fertilizer, repair agricultural implements, and prepare seeds to ensure timely sowing on the basis of winter and spring production self-rescue, and plant as many early-maturing crops as possible.

Fifth, enrich and improve agricultural institutions at all levels. All regions can determine the organizational structure of agricultural departments according to the development and needs of the work, and according to the arrangement of the work in the entire region, and report it to the Government Administration Council for approval; it cannot be required to be completely uniform at present.

As for the establishment and improvement of experimental research institutions and various professional organizations, at present, each region must be responsible for administrative leadership and guide its daily business under the unified policy plan of the central government, and change the isolated and self-contained practices of the Kuomintang era. The organizational unity between agricultural experimental research institutions and agricultural universities cannot be achieved at present, but coordination in work must be achieved.

Sixth, Chairman Mao instructed that "The People's Liberation Army, in addition to continuing to fight and performing duties, should undertake a part of the production tasks." We must regard the People's Liberation Army as a great force for national production and construction and actively help them carry out production.

Sun Xiaocun, Deputy Director of the Planning Bureau of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and Zhang Naiqi, member of the Government Administration Council, also spoke at the closing ceremony. During the conference, Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government and Vice Chairman Bo Yibo of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council came to give instructions.

Minister Li Shucheng requested all regions to ensure the implementation of the plan and proposed six implementation methods and steps.

　　全国农业生产会议闭幕
　  制定明年增产计划
    增产粮食百亿斤、植棉五千万亩、产皮棉十三亿斤。
    【新华社北京二十五日电】全国农业生产会议，已于二十日胜利闭幕。会议历时十三天。闭幕前由中央人民政府农业部部长李书城作总结报告。李部长指出这次大会的成就是：进一步了解了全国农业生产的基本情况，规定了一九五○年以恢复生产为主的总方针，制定了增产粮食一百亿斤、植棉五千万亩、产皮棉十三亿斤的总计划，并明确提出各地可因地制宜，拟定主要特种作物出口产品的恢复与增产的要求。
    关于一九五○年粮棉增产计划的标准问题，李部长说：明年要求增产粮食一百亿斤（原粮），是在现有生产水平，即水利、耕锄、施肥与生产技术等水平上加以主观努力，使之提高，做到增产；并非依靠天年好坏。如果明年天年还象今年，仍应达到这个数字，如明年天年较今年为好，则增产数字须超过一百亿斤。
    李部长要求各地保证计划的实现，并提出了以下具体的实施办法与步骤：第一、加强调查研究与组织工作。各地必须在总的方针计划下拟定出适合当地情况的具体计划，经过自下而上的修正，并制定具体实施的办法。为了计划的更加切实具体，对生产的领导更加深入，必须加强调查研究。在老区可划经济区、组织工作进行典型村、典型户的调查；在新区可通过土地改革与改革负担办法进行调查。计划制定后，最重要的问题就是组织工作。为此首先要进行深入的宣传动员工作，贯彻奖励生产的政策，提倡劳动发家，在自愿的原则下进一步开展互助合作运动，大量发动妇女参加农业生产。
    第二、把技术改进推广到农民中去。一切农村工作者必须把领导农民提高技术当成自己的经常的重要任务；一切农业技术机构与农业科学工作者均应根据农民生产的需要与本身条件进行试验研究，并和各地行政领导机关配合起来，深入群众把现有的生产办法与经验提高一步，广泛地运用新技术。
    第三、给农民以必要的投资与贷款，但是，主要地应该是依靠与发动群众的力量，开展农村的信用借贷，克服单纯依赖国家贷款的思想。此外还要注意争取私人资本向农业建设投资。
    第四、在灾区，必须组织与扶助群众开展生产自救运动，依靠开展副业、运销等办法渡过灾荒，并争取积蓄食粮。同时要积存肥料，修补农具，准备种子，以便在冬春生产自救的基础上保证按时播种，并尽量多种早熟作物。
    第五、要充实与健全各级农业机构。各地可根据工作的发展与需要，根据全区工作的按排，确定农业部门的组织机构，报政务院批准；目前还不能要求完全划一。
    至于建立与健全试验研究的机构与各种专业的组织，目前必须在中央统一方针计划下，由各地区负责行政领导并指导其日常业务，改变国民党时孤立的自成系统的作法。农业试验研究机关与农业大学之间，目前还作不到组织的统一，但必须作到工作上的配合。
    第六、毛主席指示“人民解放军除继续作战和负勤务者外，应当负担一部分生产任务”。我们必须把人民解放军看作国家生产建设的一个伟大力量，积极地帮助他们进行生产。
    闭幕时发言的还有政务院财经委员会计划局副局长孙晓村、政务院委员章乃器。大会进行期间中央人民政府副主席朱德、政务院财经委员会副主任委员薄一波都曾亲临指示。
    李书城部长要求各地保证计划实现，提出六项实施办法与步骤。
