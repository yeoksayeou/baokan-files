　　Black Stone Slope Coal Kiln Chronicles
    Kang Zhuo
    On this side, old Bai Xilu and Da Tianlu decided to install a "whirl" to use rattan-woven "shell baskets" for bailing water. Going down the slow slope from the east kiln, every ten or so feet, a wooden trough was installed on the side of the roadway against the coal wall. The end of the trough facing downwards was built higher, so that the trough was connected to the ground above by ten or so feet, dug into a flat water channel, which is a "whirl." The person bailing water stood under the trough, like a villager standing on a low bank, holding the shell baskets in both hands, bailing water like irrigating the land, pouring the water into the trough. The water flowed along the channel for ten or so feet to the front, where there was another whirl, and the water was bailed to the front again, until the kiln entrance, where a water outlet was dug to connect to the flat ground outside the kiln. A ditch was dug on the flat ground, and the water soon seeped into the sand. According to this setup, a whirl was installed at the beginning from the place where there was water at the kiln entrance, bailing out ten or so feet of water before adding another whirl. The water workers, Da San estimated: Twelve or thirteen whirls would have to be installed at the bottom, bailing water in three shifts day and night. Each water worker bailed one thousand five hundred shell baskets per shift, two shell baskets making one load. They could bail out more than two thousand two hundred loads a day. Bailing for half a month to twenty days, the east kiln could be activated, and the remaining water could be bailed out slowly, so the ventilation shafts could be opened. He then calculated the capital. Xilu's abacus was spinning rapidly, and he quickly calculated clearly: The west kiln would operate with ten people, producing less than ten tons of large, medium, small coal and broken coal every day, but not much less. The income was estimated to be one hundred fifty to one hundred sixty thousand Jinchaji border currency, equivalent to one hundred thirty to one hundred forty discounted millet; The east kiln could bail out one whirl's worth of water every three days. The first three days would require nine workers for three shifts day and night, the next two or three days would require eighteen workers. By the twentieth day, about six whirls would be bailed out, costing about two hundred forty water workers. Adding the twenty-day cost for the west kiln of two hundred workers, plus the foreman, worker leaders, odd-jobbers, and the accounting room, it would amount to about seven hundred workers for twenty days. Each worker would average four pounds of millet, plus lamp oil and furniture, requiring five thousand pounds of millet. After deducting the income from the west kiln, about two thousand discounted millet would have to be prepared before work could begin, but the large expenses for bailing water and ventilating the shafts after the sixth whirl had not been calculated. This was indeed not a small amount! Taicheng said, "We have no objection. Our west kiln can't produce ten tons of coal a day, but we'll risk our lives to do it! But Lao Bai, you have to put in the effort to shoulder this heavy burden and get a sure footing!" Lao Bai said, "Okay! Let's all come up with ideas!" At this time, Lao Yin had finished distributing the fruits and arranged for the measurement of the land. Lao Bai and Xilu, Da Tianlu went to him to discuss the kiln.

    　　　　Forty-five Decision
    Lao Yin had just finished several major tasks and was taking a breather, chatting idly with the cadres at the temple. Lao Bai and the others went up and told him about the kiln's plan. Lao Yin looked up, fluttering his eyelids, thinking hard to see if there were any other problems. After a while, he remembered what he had heard in Pingtan Ridge in the past, and hurriedly asked, "Can this kiln definitely make a profit? Those big machine-operated kilns in Yangquan cost less to capitalize and produce more and cheaper coal. Will they suppress our earthen kiln?" Da San turned his face away and hummed, as if he was about to get angry; Shuancheng said, "Don't be afraid of that. Neighboring villages still want to buy our kiln!" Tianlu said, "Our coal is strong. Even if it's a bit more expensive than the Yangquan mine, neighboring villages will save on transportation costs by coming to us. The profit is very high. Before the Liugou large kiln was flooded, how much did the big kiln owner earn!" Xilu also said, "That's the truth! I can guarantee that." Lao Bai said, "Lao Yin, don't worry about that. We're afraid of not having enough coal. Wouldn't it be better to have more? For example, I've been to Taiyuan and Yuci. How big is the Yuci spinning mill! But in our mountain gullies, people still use spinning wheels and treadle looms to weave cloth! Lao Yin, I don't have much education, but I think we can't underestimate this kind of earthen kiln! That's how China is! Am I right?" This eased Lao Yin's mind a little. He fluttered his eyelids and thought for a while, deciding he had nothing else to say.
    But the cost of opening the kiln startled him again! Lao Bai said it would take three to four thousand pounds of millet, which made even Bian Xiao, Bai Quan, and the others exclaim, "That's so much!" "Heavens! This is a big deal!" Lao Bai said, "I'll go to the county to see about a loan. Isn't the silver dollar not distributed yet? How much is there?" Shuancheng calculated, "It's almost a thousand, and three to four thousand pounds of millet should be enough." Da San hurriedly yelled, "Right! That's enough!" But many people were at a loss, and Xiao Yanggui stuck out his tongue an inch long, saying, "We can't be confused about this! Didn't Shuancheng's brother mention this before? No one dared to make a decision back then!" Lao Bai had already made up his mind. He explained that the silver dollar could not be touched under any circumstances and returned to the county. Lao Yin discussed with Xilu for a while, hoping that Xilu would take the lead in borrowing money from the public to run the kiln. Xilu was anxious and said, "Why are you bringing this up again? Oh, my dear Lao Yin! Do you think I'm being insincere? Look, even Chunqi took my tattered clothes and belongings, and others replaced them for me. Besides, I was also given some fruits: I'm also a liberated farmer! If I'm even half insincere to our Communist Party and our whole village, Lao Yin! I'll tear out my heart and lungs for everyone to see! Don't mention it! Anyway, I'll contribute a share and work hard with everyone in the village." Lao Yin had nothing to say, so he sat down and thought to himself, still feeling uneasy about the kiln.
    On the other side, the village was planning to distribute the land while waiting for Lao Bai, but Lao Bai didn't return for four days, and people were shouting anxiously. On the fifth day, Lao Bai returned and conveyed three things to Lao Yin: First, the county had no objection to opening the kiln at Black Stone Slope. Second, no grain loans could be obtained. He said angrily, "Lao Yin, you were right: production is not the focus! Damn it! I wrote a letter to the district, disagreeing with the higher-ups!" Lao Yin asked, "What's the third thing?" At this time, the village cadres had all arrived. Lao Bai took out his notebook filled with crooked handwriting and slowly conveyed Chairman Mao's report "The Current Situation and Our Tasks," finally saying that the middle peasants should not be moved too much when dividing the land, and there were new standards for classifying people's components, and there should be no arbitrary disturbances. This was a bolt from the blue for Lao Yin! Could it be that the thorough distribution he had been planning for so long was not going to work? Lin Bao gave him all the accounts he had prepared for the land distribution. After checking, it was true! According to the equal distribution calculation, almost half of the village's households were moving the middle peasants! He couldn't help but shout in a feverish panic, "Oh dear!" But after a while, Bian Xiao said, "Chairman Mao's method is also right. We have so little land to begin with. Someone like Lin Bao, a middle peasant, has never touched a kiln for generations. His father worked as a long-term laborer for ten years. It's not very appropriate to move him even if it's only three or four acres of land." Shuancheng said, "Chunqi and Lin Bao voluntarily gave up three acres! There are quite a few middle peasant households like him. I've long thought it was really hard to say to move those people!" Lin Bao smiled awkwardly, "Chunqi's contribution is okay! To be honest, I wouldn't be happy if I had to be moved again." Xiao Yanggui said, "It's not just the middle peasants! The Liugou family has four acres of land per person. According to the equal distribution, it's not even enough for two acres per person. She also has to be moved!" Bai Quan's family hurriedly said, "She's just relying on the land. According to the yield, it's not even enough for the average. Why should she be moved!" The Liugou family said, "Let's just talk about the land, Xiao Yanggui. I might even have to be struggled against!" Xiao Yanggui fluttered his eyelids at her twice and said, "Struggle against you? There's no time for that! If you were thirty years younger, it might be a little interesting to struggle against you!" People laughed happily! Lao Yin was frowning, looking up. Shuancheng said, "Most of us here are poor peasants and workers. Do you think Chairman Mao's method is okay?" Da San said, "Okay! I don't want the land!" Then Xiao Yanggui and Tianlu also said they had enough land and didn't want it. Many others didn't want it either. Lao Bai laughed, "What? Are the cadres setting an example? No one wants it?" Shuancheng said, "We're all kiln workers, and we might not be able to farm it well if we have too much land!" Xiao Yanggui said, "Whether you're a kiln worker or not, someone like our Third Uncle Da is so red and white and fat and energetic, he'll go blind if you give him land." Lao Yin lowered his head and asked, "Then what will you eat?" Tianlu said, "Ah, eat! We'll eat coal!" People laughed again. Lao Yin suddenly remembered that this was an industrial and mining area, and he couldn't help but look at Lao Bai, making a heavy decision in his heart: They had to open the kiln! At this time, Da San stood up, reached out and grabbed his top hat and waved it, saying, "Stop talking about this bullshit! We couldn't get a grain loan anyway! Let's talk about using the silver dollar to start the kiln!" So he immediately summoned the cadres, conveyed the opinions of checking components and soliciting land distribution, and discussed using the silver dollar to jointly operate the kiln by the whole village and Xilu. The cadres all left with heavy burdens. Lao Bai was transferred to the district to lead the resident area because there was no one in the district. He left a few key cadres to discuss for a while, preparing to leave. Lao Yin divided the work among the committee members: Bian Xiao and Lin Bao were in charge of land distribution, and Shuancheng and Tianlu were in charge of the kiln. Afterwards, because Tianlu was in a hurry to go down to the kiln for a shift, he pulled Shuancheng and went to Da San to discuss the kiln.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义
    康濯
    这边老白喜禄大三天禄却决定了要安上“旋”，使滕条编的“壳篓”打水。从东窑顺慢斜坡下去，每隔十来丈，就在行道一边靠煤墙装设个木水槽，槽朝下的一头垒高些，让这槽跟上边十来丈地面连接着，刨成一道平平的水渠，这就是一道“旋”；打水的人站在槽下面，象庄户人站在低岸上，两手提着壳篓，往高岸一壳篓一壳篓打水浇地一样，打上水倒进水槽，水顺渠道流到十多丈的前边，那里再有一道旋，再把水打到前面，直到窑口，就凿个水口通窑外平地，平地上刨一条渠沟，水流不远便钻进砂土去了。就照这个架势，一开头从窑口有水的地方安旋，打净十来丈水再加一道旋一班水工，大三估量着：到最下边得安十二三道旋，每天日夜三班打水，每个水工一班打一千五百壳篓，两壳篓合一担，一天能打出二千二百多担，打它半月二十天，东窑就能活动开，剩下的水慢慢打着，就能开工透风筒了。再合算垫本，喜禄算盘子打得滴溜转，一会就算得清清楚楚：西窑动弹十个人，每天出大中小炭和碎炭不到十吨也差不很多，约摸收入十五六万元晋察翼边币，折合一百三四十折算小米；东窑每三天能打净一道旋的水，头三天日夜三班共九个工，二三天十八个工，到二十天约打到六道旋，花二百四十来个水工，加上西窑二十天二百个工，再加领事、工头、领岔、闲工和柜房，二十天约合七百个工，一个工平均四斤小米，连灯油家具，得五千斤米，除了西窑收入，还得准备二千来折算米才能动工，但六道旋以后，打水、透风筒的大花销还没计算。这的确不是个小数目！泰成说：“咱是没意见，咱西窑一天出不了十吨炭吧，反正破着命干呗！可老白呀！你得使出劲担上这付重担子，拿住个准谱谱哩！”老白道：“行！大伙想法呗！”这时老尹领导分完了果实，丈量土地也布置下去了，老白就和喜禄大三天禄们找他商议窑上的事去。
    　　　　四十五　决心
    老尹正办完了几件大事，歇了口气，在庙上和干部们闲捣拉。老白他们上去把窑上的计划告给以后，老尹又仰着＠子扑展着眼皮，一个劲捉摸着；看还有什么问题没有。一会，他想起过去在平潭垴听到的事，就忙问：“这窑准能见利么？阳泉那片子那么些机器大窑，人家垫本花得少，出炭又多又贱，不会压住咱这土窑？”大三撇过脸去哼了一声，象要生气；拴成道：“那不怕，左近邻村还想买咱的窑哩！”天禄说：“咱这炭强，比阳泉矿上贵点子吧，邻村来咱这少掏脚钱，还是一样。利是有大利的，柳沟大窑没淹那工夫，大窑主挣了多少啊！”喜禄也说：“这是实在话！这咱也能保险。”老白道：“老尹，这你甭结记。咱们这会怕的是炭少，多啦不更好？比方说吧，我到过太原榆次，那榆次纺纱厂多大！可咱山沟沟哩还不一样有人摇纺车蹬木机织布！老尹，我是文化低，可我看咱们也不能小看这号土窑！咱中国就有这么个架势！你说对不？”这倒让老尹宽了宽心，他扑展着眼皮想了想，算是没说的了。
    但开窑的垫本却又让他吓了一跳！老白说要三四千斤小米，这可连扁小白泉家们不禁也叫了起来：“那么些呀！”“老天！这可是大事！”老白说：“我这就去县里看看贷款的事。现洋不是还没分么？ 多少？”拴成合计了一下道：“不到一千也差不多，三四千斤米倒够了。”大三忙吆喝道：“对！就这就行！”但不少人却＠＠地没有主意，小洋鬼更把舌头吐出一寸长，连说：“这可不能稀里糊涂！过去不是拴成他兄弟也提过这事？那会就谁也不敢作主的！”老白却主意已经打定，他交代了现洋怎么也不能动，就回县了。这边老尹又跟喜禄商议了一阵，他总希望还是由喜禄出头向公家贷款来经营窑，喜禄却急的不行，忙说：“你怎么又提这啊？好咱的个老尹哩！你莫非当着我是虚情假意？你看，连春起闹了我那点破衣裳家什，也使别的补给我了，另外我又还分了些果实：我也是翻身农民哩！我对咱共产党、对咱浑村大伙要有半点不实在，老尹！咱掏出心肝五脏让大伙看看也行！甭提这啦！反正咱我顶个身股，跟浑村大伙一道使劲干就是。”老尹没的说了，就坐下来一个人又扑展着眼皮想着，不知怎么他对窑的事总有些心眼不落实。
    再说村里一边计划分地，一边等老白，但老白一去四天不回，人们急得直叫唤。第五天，老白回来了，他给老尹传达了三件事：一是黑石坡开窑县里没意见，二是贷粮款都不成，他气愤愤地说：“老尹，还是你说的：生产不是重点！＠他妈！我给分区写了信，不同意上头这么办！”老尹又问：“第三件呢？”这时村里干部们都来了，老白就掏出他那写满歪歪扭扭的字的笔记本，慢慢传达了毛主席“目前形势和我们的任务”的报告，最后说到平分地土时动中农的面不能太大，划成份也有了新标准，不能随便闹。这一件事却给了老尹一个晴天霹雳！他辛辛苦苦计划了多久的彻底平分，莫非又不行？林宝给了他准备分地的一切清账，一查看，可不！按平分算，全村动中农的户数，差不多有一半！他不禁浑身燥热地嚷道：“哎呀！”但一会扁小却说：“毛主席这办法倒也对。咱这地势地土原本就少，象林宝那号中农吧，几辈子没沾过窑，他父亲还扛了十来年长工，一人并对三四亩地，动他就是不很合适。”拴成道：“春起林宝倒自动了三亩哩！象他那号中农户很不少，我早就捉摸着动那些人实在难说！”林宝蹩蹩扭扭地笑道：“春起的倒算了！说实话，这回要再动我的，我掏开心眼就是不大痛快。”小洋鬼道：“不光中农哩！柳沟家一人四亩地，按平分，一人还不够二亩，她也得动哩！”白泉家忙道：“她尽赖地，按产量还不够平均数，怎么就动了她的！”柳沟家说：“光说地吧，小洋鬼，我还许得挨斗争哩！”小洋鬼对她扑展了两下眼皮道：“斗你？没那个工夫！你要年轻三十岁嘛，那斗斗许有点意思！”人们欢喜地笑了！老尹却一个人仰着＠子发愁；拴成说：“咱这里多数是贫农工人的，大伙看毛主席这办法行不？”大三道：“行！我不要地！”接着小洋鬼和天禄也说地够了，不要了，别人也有不少不要的，老白笑道：“怎么这是干部起模范么？都不要？”拴成说：“尽把子黑虎虎的窑黑，要多了还许种不好哩！”小洋鬼道：“窑黑不窑黑吧，象咱大三叔又红又白又胖古楞东的，给他地他也得瞎了。”老尹低下头来问道：“那你们吃什么？”天禄道：“唉，吃！吃炭呗！”人们又笑起来，老尹也猛又想起这里是工矿区，不觉望了望老白，心中重重地下了决心：就是得开窑！这时大三往起一立，伸手抓过礼帽一挥道：“紧说这干球！这不是贷粮也没有啦！说现洋闹窑吧！”于是立时召集了干部们，传达了检查成分、征求分地的意见和讨论拿现洋由浑村和喜禄一道闹窑，干部们就都担着重担子走了。老白因为区里没人，调他去驻区领导，他把几个主要干部留下捣拉了一阵，准备走；老尹又跟委员们分了分工：扁小林宝们管分地，拴成天禄管窑；完了，因为天禄还要赶着下窑去干一班营生，他就拉上拴成，寻大三捣拉窑上的事去了。
