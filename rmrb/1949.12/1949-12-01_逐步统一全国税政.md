Gradually Unify the National Tax Policy
    He Li

The opening of the first National Tax Work Conference in Beijing, the capital of the people, is of even greater significance for the tax policy construction of New China. The people of the whole country hope to gradually, effectively, and rapidly unify the national tax policy, to benefit the guarantee of victory in the revolutionary war, the development of production, and the prosperity of the economy.

The people's tax work in the Liberated Areas has achieved great success during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation. Because at that time we were in the economically backward countryside, coupled with the enemy's division and devastation, the economic life of the peasants was greatly damaged. Although under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, land reform was carried out to develop production, the peasants' production level has always been low, and life is still inevitably difficult. Under such conditions, all the people, administrative cadres, and tax workers in our Liberated Areas finally guaranteed the supply for the revolutionary war, and enabled the government's finances to have a certain strength to carry out various undertakings and help the people carry out various production and construction projects. The past achievements of our tax work in various Liberated Areas are inseparable from today's victory in the national revolutionary war.

However, precisely because our tax work in the past originated and developed in a divided guerrilla environment, it is inevitably carrying a great deal of regionalism. Whether in tax administration, tax law, tax rates, and tax collection procedures, we had to handle the tax work of a place according to the specific environment, characteristics, and our own experience at that time and place. At that time, it was appropriate and not to be criticized for each Liberated Area to independently solve problems according to its own local conditions. But today, most of the country has been liberated, and only a small part of the southwest and Taiwan is about to be liberated. The situation of the enemy's division no longer exists. The lives of the people across the country are closely related, and the measures or changes in one region often affect the whole country. In this situation where everything in the country is tending towards concentration and unity, tax work, like other work, is one of the direct links between the government and the people, so it must strive for unity to achieve better unity with the people. Therefore, we hope that all tax authorities should not only summarize past experiences, but also pay attention to critically absorbing past experiences, and should not be confined to past experiences. Today, we must have a national concept in everything. Even a very small matter must start from the whole country, that is, from the interests of all the people, so that the national tax work can tend to be rational and sound.

In the past, the tax policy was not unified, not only in the Liberated Areas, but also the Kuomintang bandit gang, which ruled China for more than 20 years, did not have a truly unified scale. In order to squeeze the people, the number of taxes levied was countless. In particular, local taxes were even more diverse, with several taxes a day. Taking Beijing as an example, under the three tax systems of direct, commodity, and local taxes, there were more than 30 kinds of excessive and miscellaneous taxes. Just as the satirical saying popular among the people at that time: "The Kuomintang has ten thousand taxes." In addition, there were disguised tax laws levied by imperialism in China, and the fees in Shanghai alone reached more than 300 kinds. After liberation, most of the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes in various places were abolished. However, due to our insufficient understanding of the situation in large cities and newly liberated areas, we had to temporarily continue to use the old system for some taxes. Today, most parts of the country are stable, and we urgently need to sort out and reform these tax systems to meet the requirements of the vast number of people.

The work of unifying the national tax policy is a rather complicated matter today. There are many aspects that need to be unified. Here are some of the major ones:

First of all, we must gradually achieve a balance and rationality between urban and rural taxation. In the past, because the Liberated Areas were in the countryside, the people's liberation war relied entirely on the support of the peasants. The peasants not only had to contribute money, but also had to contribute a lot of manpower and material resources, and the burden was very heavy. Even today, the proportion of peasants' burden still exceeds the industrial and commercial tax. Due to the low productivity of the peasants, their income is very small, and the burden rate, according to last year's statistics, accounts for 20% to 25% of their total income, while the income of industry and commerce is generally many times higher than that of the peasants, and their burden rate only accounts for more than 4% to less than 20% of their net income, so that the tax revenue of some cities cannot even be self-sufficient. Therefore, the unification work in the future must achieve a balance and rationality in the tax burden between urban and rural areas. That is to say, in the future, the proportion of industrial and commercial taxes should be increased so that industry and agriculture have the opportunity for balanced development. For the sake of national construction, the industrial and commercial circles should be duty-bound to do this today. Only when the national economy is prosperous, prices are balanced, agricultural production is booming, and industrial production has sufficient raw materials and markets can commerce achieve normal circulation, which is beneficial to industry, agriculture, and commerce.

Secondly, improve the tax system. The formulation and unification of various taxes is an important step in opening up tax sources, which is an important issue related to financial revenue. Because everything is in its infancy today, and we lack statistical surveys, we have not yet discovered many taxable sources. Even if we have discovered them, we have not had time to formulate appropriate tax items. For example, today we only have customs tax, but we have not yet formulated a tax system on the land borders with the Soviet Union, Mongolia, India, Vietnam, and Myanmar. For example, regarding aquatic products, we only stipulate marine product tax, and we have not yet formulated tax collection methods for freshwater products in inland rivers. We should conduct more investigations and determine tax items in detail for all such cases. Only by developing all kinds of tax sources and increasing tax revenue through sorting out can we seek sufficient financial resources and ensure a balance of financial revenue and expenditure. The next is the tax rate. Today, there are great differences in the tax collection of many goods. Taking flour as an example, the tax rate in the Northeast Liberated Area is 8%, while the tax rate in other Liberated Areas is 2.50%, which affects the level of flour prices in various places and affects the flour industry in the Northeast. If we unify the tax rates in various places, we can make their development balanced. Various industrial products should only be taxed once after they are produced, and there should be no so-called "separate measures" and repeated taxation, which hinders the development of production and exchange. For example, after timber in the Northeast is taxed in the Northeast, it is transported to North China or other areas, which is a matter of checking for tax evasion and paying supplementary tax, and should not be taxed again.

The procedures for tax collection must also be simplified and unified as much as possible. Although this issue is a technical issue, if it is not consistent, it will also affect the sales of goods. For example, some areas are still using fake tax tickets. Of course, at the beginning of our takeover of an area, due to the limitations of various conditions, this expedient method can be adopted. However, because other previously liberated areas have already abolished fake tax tickets and made their own new tax tickets, there is the difficulty of distinguishing between true and false in inspection, and merchants inevitably suffer from delays. Therefore, in the future, there should be unified regulations for tickets, inspections, etc., to facilitate internal and external exchanges.

The unification of institutions is also one of the issues to be resolved at this meeting. The tax system should be as unified as possible, eliminating redundancies, strengthening the internal division of labor, clarifying the scope of responsibilities, and determining the principles of tax distribution in accordance with the financial system. As for the adjustment of personnel establishment, the principle of streamlining should be followed to achieve less employment and more work.

In this unification movement, the basic key lies in the unification of thought and legislation. In addition to objective reasons, the lack of unified thinking is also an important reason for the various phenomena of disunity mentioned above. The deviation of tax thinking: One is the one-sided "benevolent government" viewpoint. In the past reactionary ruling era, many of our comrades opposed exorbitant taxes, so some people advocated light taxes regardless of national needs. Naturally, a government that serves the people should not have too heavy taxes on the people. In fact, we are much lighter today than the Kuomintang bandit gang's destructive tax policy of killing the chicken to get the eggs. However, we should know that we are still in a period of war today, and all production and construction are yet to begin. Without sufficient supply, we cannot achieve victory, nor can we complete construction. Speaking of benevolent government, if the people cannot be liberated and the people's production and living standards cannot be improved, what is benevolent government? Therefore, whether among the people or among the cadres, we must correct this thinking, on the one hand, we must actively transport and contribute, and on the other hand, we must do a good job in tax collection. Another wrong idea is the pure fiscal point of view that does not care about developing production and prospering the economy. They only know how to extract from the people, as long as they complete the task. Regardless of whether this tax is reasonable, whether it is in line with the overall line and general policy in all directions, it affects production. Coupled with the remnants of localism, considering issues mostly from a local perspective and lacking an overall concept, this will hinder the correct development of fiscal work and must be eliminated.

The correction of thinking is not the entire solution to the problem. On the basis of ideological awareness, there must also be laws to guarantee it. Therefore, unified regulations must be formulated so that everyone has a standard to follow. In the future, all national tax and monopoly laws and regulations shall be formulated, promulgated, and implemented uniformly by the Central People's Government, and all localities shall strictly abide by the regulations promulgated by the Central Government. If there are any opinions, in addition to complying with the implementation, they shall be submitted to the Central Government for consideration and modification. Before the Central Government modifies them, they shall not be modified without authorization or refuse to implement them under the pretext of special circumstances. Any phenomena of disorganization and indiscipline cannot be tolerated.

In order to overcome the blindness in tax work, we must strengthen investigation and research, starting from the actual production situation and affordability of the masses. Only with in-depth investigation can we make correct calculations, so that the masses' burdens will not be excessively light or excessively heavy, and the state's financial revenue can achieve accurate budgets and final accounts, and balance revenue and expenditure.

The unification of tax policy is now at a time when it brooks no delay, and we hope that this meeting can be appropriately resolved. Of course, because the country has not yet been completely unified today, and everything is in its infancy, it is also impossible to have a comprehensive and accurate statistics on the wealth of the people. This unification of tax policy cannot unify all the problems, but many basic laws and regulations can be largely determined. The coming year is a year for sorting out the national tax policy. As long as everyone has a unified understanding and works together, we will definitely victoriously and steadily move the tax policy towards the road of unification!

### 逐步统一全国税政

　　逐步统一全国税政
    贺笠
    此次首届全国税务工作会议在人民的首都——北京开幕，对新中国的税政建设具有着更重要的意义。全国人民都希望逐步地有效地迅速将全国税政统一起来，以利于保障革命战争胜利，发展生产，繁荣经济。
    解放区的人民税收工作，在八年抗日战争及三年来的解放战争中具有很大成绩。因为当时我们是处在经济落后的农村，加上敌人的分割摧残，农民的经济生活遭到极大的破坏，虽历经共产党及人民政府领导进行土地改革发展生产，但由于农民的生产水平向来低下生活仍不免于困难。就在这样的条件下，我们解放区的全体人民、行政干部及税务工作同志，终于保障了革命战争的供给，并使政府的财政能有一定力量举办各种事业，帮助人民进行各种生产建设。我们各解放区过去税收工作的功绩与今天全国革命战争的胜利是分不开的。
    但是正因为我们的税收工作过去是在被割裂的游击环境中发生和发展起来的，它就不可免地要带着很大的地域性，无论在税收行政、税法、税率及征税手续等方面，都不能不按照当时当地的具体环境、特性和自己的经验来处理一个地方的税收工作。当时各解放区，这种按照自己地方的不同的情形而独立解决问题是应当的，无可厚非的。但是到了今天，全国大部地区已经解放，敌人仅有西南和台湾一小部地区也不久即将解放，过去敌人分割的局面已不存在了，全国人民的生活息息相关，一个地区的措施或变动往往影响全国。在此全国一切事业都在趋向集中和统一的形势下，税收工作亦如其他工作，是政府与人民直接联系的纽带之一，因而它更必须力求统一，以与人民求得更好的团结。因此，我们希望各税收机关不仅要总结过去的经验，尤应注意批判地吸取过去的经验，而不应拘泥于过去的经验，我们今天事事都要有国家观念，那怕是一件很小的事情，均必须从全国出发，亦即从全体人民利益出发，才能使全国的税收工作趋于合理健全。
    过去税政之不统一，不仅解放区如此，即在中国统治二十余年的国民党匪帮，亦无真正统一的规模。他们为了压榨人民，课税之多，不胜枚举。特别地方税更是五花八门，一日数税。即以北京而论，在直接、货物、地方三种税收系统之下，苛杂达三十余种。正如当时人民所流行的讽刺语：“国民党万税”。加之帝国主义在中国征收的变相税法，上海一地的规费即达三百余种。解放以后，各地苛捐杂税大部废除。但由于我们对大城市及新解放区情况了解不够，不能不在某些税收上暂时沿用旧制。今天全国大部地区均已安定，我们对这些税制亟须加以整理改革，以适合于广大人民的要求。
    全国税政的统一工作，在今天是一件相当繁杂的事情，它所需要统一的方面是很多的，兹特举其大者，说明如下：
    首先必须使城市税收与农村税收逐渐达到平衡合理。过去因为解放区是在农村，人民解放战争全靠农民支持，农民不但要出钱，还要拿出大量的人力物力，负担是很重的。直到今日农民的负担比重还超过工商业税。农民由于生产力的低下，收入甚少，而负担率据去年统计，占其总收入百分之二十至百分之二十五，而工商业收入一般均超过农民好多倍，而其负担率则只占其纯收入百分之四以上至百分之二十以下，以至有些城市税入尚不能自给。因此今后的统一工作，必须使城乡税负上达到平衡合理。这就是说，今后应提高工商税的比率，使工农业都有平衡发展的机会。为了国家建设，今天工商界对此应是义不容辞。只有国家经济繁荣，物价平衡，农业生产兴旺，工业生产才有充足的原料和市场，商业也才能得到正常的流转，于工农商均有好处。
    其次，健全税收制度。各种税收的厘订与统一，实为开辟税源的重要步骤，这是关系财政收的重要问题。由于我们今天一切都在草创，缺乏统计调查，许多应征的税源我们还未发现，即已发现我们也还来不及订出适当的税目，如象我们今天只有海关收税，而陆地上与苏联、蒙古、印度、越南、缅甸诸国边境，都还未订出税收制度。又如关于水产，我们只规定海产税而内河淡水产也尚未订出税收办法，诸如此类，我们均应多加调查，详细确定税目。只有把各种税源都开辟出来，从整理中增加税收，才能求得财源充足，保证财政收支平衡。再次是税率，今天在许多货物的税收上都存在着很大的差异。以面粉而论，东北解放区的税率规定为百分之八，其他上解放区的税率则为百分之二．五○，这样就影响到各地面粉事业价格的高低，影响东北面粉事业。如果我们把各地的税率统一起来，就可使它们的发展得到平衡。各种工业产品在其生产出来以后，只应统一征税一次，不应再有所谓“单行办法”，重复征收的现象，有碍于生产及交换的发展，比如东北的木料在东北征税之后，运到华北或其他地区，那就是检查漏税和补税问题，而不应再征。
    征税的手续也须力求简化与统一。这一问题虽属一技术问题，但如果不求得一致，那也会影响到商品的畅销。如有些地区至今仍在改用伪税票。当然，在我们刚接管一个地区的开始，由于各方条件的限制，这种变通办法是可以采用的。但是由于其他先解放的地区早已废除了伪税票而自制了新税票，所以在检查方面即有真伪难辨之苦，而商贩亦不免有受稽延之烦，因此今后对于票照、检验……均应有统一的规定，以利内外的交流。
    机构的统一亦为此次会议应解决的问题之一，税收系统应尽量使其一元化，裁撤骈枝，加强内部分工，使责任界限分明，并依照财政体制，确定税款分配原则。至于人员的编制调整，应以精简为原则，做到用人少，做事多。
    在这统一运动中，基本关键在于思想与立法的统一。以上所谈各种不统一的现象，除客观原因外，思想的不统一亦为重要原因之一。税收思想的偏差：一是片面的“仁政”观点。在过去反动统治时代，我们许多同志都反对过苛捐税，因而有的人不管国家需要如何，一味主张轻税。自然，一个为人民服务的政府对人民的税收是不应过重的，实际上我们今天比国民党匪帮那种毁灭性的杀鸡取卵的税收政策，不知要轻多少倍。但是，我们应该知道，我们今天还是在战争时期，一切生产建设正待开始，如果没有充分的供给，就不能取得胜利，也不能完成建设，就说仁政吧：如果人民不能得到解放，不能提高人民生产、生活水平，那算什么仁政呢？因此，不管在人民当中或干部当中，都必须端正这种思想，一方要积极输将，一面要做好税收工作。另一种错误思想，是不管发展生产繁荣经济的单纯财政观点。他们只知道取给于民，只要完成任务就行。不管这种税收是否合理，是否与四面八方的总路线总政策相符合，以致影响生产。加上地方主义的残余思想作崇，考虑问题多从局部出发，缺乏整体观念，这都会妨碍财政工作正确的发展，必须加以肃清。
    思想的端正还不是问题的全部的解决，在思想自觉的基础上还必须有法律来保证。因此必须定出统一法规，使大家有所准绳。今后凡有关全国性的税务及专卖法令条例，均应由中央人民政府统一制订公布实行，各地对中央颁布之条例均应切实遵守。如有意见，除一面遵照执行外，一面呈请中央考虑修改。在中央未修改前不得擅自修改或借口特殊不予执行。任何无组织无纪律的现象均不能容许。
    为克服税务工作中的盲目性，必须加强调查研究，从群众的实际生产状况与负担能力出发，只有有了深入调查，才能作出正确计算，这样才不致使群众负担发生畸轻畸重的现象，国家财政收入也才能达到精确的预决算，平衡收支。
    税政的统一，今天已到刻不容缓的时候，切望这次会议能得到适当的解决。当然，由于今天全国还未完全统一，一切都在草创，对于人民的财富，也不可能有全面的精确的统计，这次税政的统一工作，尚不能把一切问题都统一起来，但许多基本的法例规章大体可以确定。今后的一年是整理全国税政的一年，只要我们大家认识一致，共同努力，定会胜利地、稳步地使税政迈向统一的道路！
