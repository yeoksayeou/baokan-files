　　上海召开二届各界代表会议
  　讨论克服当前财经困难
    贯彻中央人民政府委员会四次会议精神团结一致拥护并推行人民胜利折实公债
    【新华社上海十五日电】上海市第二届人民代表会议，于五日揭幕，十一日结束。到会有工人、郊区农民、工商界、青年妇女、文化教育界、民主党派、宗教、台湾民主自治同盟代表、特邀代表、军管会、市政府、中共上海市委会、警备公安部队代表等共六百六十七人。这次代表会议贯彻中央人民政府委员会第四次会议的精神与第一届各界人民代表会议的方针，着重讨论了上海财政经济问题和克服当前困难的办法。会议第一日，由陈毅市长致开幕词，潘汉年副市长向代表们报告了关于上海市八、九、十三个月市政工作。第二日曾山副市长作了关于财政经济工作报告，财政局、劳动局、民政局代表又作了三个补充报告。到会代表听取报告后，都进一步了解到在三个月反封锁斗争中，上海市生产情况基本上已经好转。虽然目前还存在着困难，但困难的性质已经改变了。七月份上海所遭遇的是原料、销路等的严重困难，现在则转为由于物价波动和年关逼近的资金困难。而解决这一困难的途径，除了团结一致，继续进行反封锁斗争外，则为拥护和推行中央人民政府决定发行的人民胜利折实公债。
