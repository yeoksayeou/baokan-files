　　Xinjiang Daily Inaugurated in Dihua
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 25th] Xinjiang Daily was inaugurated in Dihua on the 6th. The inaugural issue of the newspaper, in its editorial titled "Striving to Build a New Xinjiang for the People," pointed out the tasks in various aspects of politics, economy, culture, and education after the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang. When discussing the ethnic issues in Xinjiang, the article stated: "Xinjiang is a multi-ethnic region. Due to the oppression, appeasement, and massacres by successive generations of reactionary rulers, serious divisions and hatred have been created among the people of various ethnic groups, resulting in unfortunate incidents of mutual killing among ethnic groups in history. We oppose ethnic discrimination, oppose Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, and resolutely implement equality, unity, and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups within China, making Xinjiang truly a united, friendly, and harmonious big family of all ethnic groups. We must earnestly implement the ethnic policies established in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, ensuring that all ethnic minorities have the freedom to develop their languages and scripts, maintain and reform their customs and habits, and religious beliefs. The People's Government should help the people of all ethnic groups develop their political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings."
