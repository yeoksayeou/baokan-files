　　Madame Vaillant-Couturier's Reply

    Dear friends:

    On behalf of Madame Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the 80 million women members of the 59 national organizations affiliated with the Women's International Democratic Federation, we extend our sisterly greetings to you.

    We have stepped into the gate of China, and along the way, we have received warm welcomes from Chinese sisters. We truly do not know how to express our gratitude.

    Most of us come from faraway countries, whose people in the past did not understand China very well. But today is different. The whole world is celebrating every victory of yours. Every fighter who fights to defend lasting world peace understands that any serious blow to imperialism by any country is a common victory for everyone. Your victory has further strengthened the democratic and peaceful camp headed by the Soviet Union; your victory is our new inspiration, strengthening the confidence and strength of those of us who fight against imperialism and for national independence. Never before have we felt so strongly that the barriers between the peoples of all countries are artificial, created by imperialists to serve their huge war plans.

    Never before have we felt so strongly how closely united are the women of the world, the mothers of the world. Among these mothers are some who have paid a great sacrifice to defeat Hitler and Japanese fascists, and today the Soviet mothers, who are fighting for peace with all their strength, the Chinese mothers who actively participate in the cause of national liberation, the mothers in the oppressed countries, and the mothers in the imperialist countries. We all have a common goal, which is that we want our children to live, to live happily in a peaceful world. Therefore, our common responsibility is to do everything we can to stop aggressive war.

    Long live the great unity of the women of the world!

    Long live all the forces of peace under the leadership of the great Soviet Union!

    Long live the All-China Democratic Women's Federation!

    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

　　古久里夫人答词
    【新华社北京四日电】国际民主妇女联合会总书记瓦伦特·古久里夫人在北京东站的欢迎会上的答词全文：
    亲爱的朋友：
    我们谨代表国际民主妇联主席戈登夫人以及国际民主妇联所属的五十九个国家八千万妇女会员向你们致姐妹的敬礼。
    我们踏进了中国国门，沿途受到中国姐妹们的热烈欢迎，真不知如何来表达我们的感激的心情。
    我们大多数来自遥远的国家，这些国家的人民过去对中国不甚了解，可是今天不同了，全世界都在庆祝着你们的每一个胜利了。每一个为保卫全世界持久和平而战斗的战士，都了解，任何一个国家对帝国主义的严重打击，也就是大家共同的胜利。你们的胜利，更加强了以苏联为首的民主和平阵营；你们的胜利，是我们新的鼓舞，使我们为反对帝国主义以及争取民族独立而斗争的人们更增强了信心和力量。我们从来没有象今天这样感觉到各国人民之间的障碍原来都是人为的，都是帝国主义分子所制造用以为他们巨大的战争计划服务的。
    我们从来没有象今天这样感觉到全世界的妇女、全世界的母亲们是如何地密切地团结。这些母亲们中间，有些曾经为打败希特拉和日本法西斯蒂付了很大的牺牲，而今天又以全力为和平斗争的苏联母亲们，积极参加国家解放事业的中国的母亲们，在被压迫国家的母亲们，还有那些在帝国主义国家的母亲们，我们都有一个共同的目标，就是我们要我们的孩子能活下去，能够在和平的世界里幸福地生活，因此，我们共同责任就是要以全力制止侵略战争。
    世界妇女大团结万岁！
    在伟大苏联领导下所有一切和平力量万岁！
    中华全国民主妇联万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
