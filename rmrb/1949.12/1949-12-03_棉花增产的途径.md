Ways to Increase Cotton Production
　　Zhang Guangju

　　I.
　　According to statistics, China's raw cotton production once reached a peak of 1.7 million dan (100 catties), while the 1949 statistics show only 8 million dan, a difference of almost one-fold. Therefore, how to promote increased cotton production is a problem that urgently needs to be studied. To find the correct way to increase production, we must first understand the reasons for the decline in cotton production over the years. In my personal opinion, one reason is the reduction of cotton field area, and the other is the reduction of yield per unit area.

　　The reasons for the reduction of cotton field area: (1) The inability to guarantee the supply of grain in cotton-producing areas, and the unreasonable cotton-grain price ratio, are the basic reasons for the reduction of cotton field area. The formation of this reason is due to the long-term blockade and division by the enemy in the past, and the destruction and obstruction of transportation, forming an abnormal state of material exchange, coupled with the plunder and devastation by the Japanese invaders, which made grain expensive and cotton cheap in cotton-producing areas (while grain was cheap and cotton expensive in grain-producing areas). Low cotton prices hurt farmers, and planting cotton was not only unprofitable but also affected the lives of cotton farmers (in 1936, one catty of lint cotton was equivalent to 11.8 catties of millet; during the Japanese occupation from 1938 to 1943, one catty of lint cotton was equivalent to 5.285 catties of millet; from 1946 to 1948, one catty of lint cotton was equivalent to 7.52 catties of millet). Secondly, the increase of various disasters and the lack of food also made farmers dare not plant a large amount of cotton. (2) Due to the plunder and destruction by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, the labor force and livestock decreased. Cotton cultivation requires more labor than general food crops. Under the condition that planting cotton has no significant benefit, coupled with the difficulty of labor and livestock, the cotton field area will inevitably decrease. In addition, due to the inconvenience of transportation and the difficulty in adjusting fuel, farmers in cotton-producing areas mostly plant tall-stalk crops to solve the fuel problem, which also affects the reduction of cotton field area. (3) Due to the fragmentation of land, farmers must first plant a considerable amount of food crops, and then plant cotton, which also makes it difficult to expand the cotton planting area.

　　Based on the above reasons, according to available statistics, the national cotton field area in 1937 was 62 million mu (one mu is approximately 0.165 acres), accounting for 4.37 percent of the national total cultivated land area of 141.9 million mu. The national cotton field area in 1949 was only 39 million mu, accounting for 2.7 percent of the national total cultivated land area.

　　Reasons for the reduction of cotton yield per unit area: ① Due to the lack of labor and livestock, cotton cultivation technology has also been reduced. The number of times of plowing has been reduced. In the past, land could be plowed twice, but now it is only plowed once, only spring plowing is carried out without winter plowing, and the plowing is very shallow, which hinders the growth of cotton plants. The number of times of intertillage has also been reduced, generally only hoeing three or four times, and some only hoeing twice. In terms of sowing time, it is also impossible to sow in time according to the season due to the limitation of labor and livestock. In addition, the extensive management of cotton fields can reduce cotton production. According to recent incomplete investigations, in 1948, the number of plowing times was reduced by 20.17 percent compared with the pre-war period, the average number of harrowing times was reduced by 12.22 percent, and the average number of intertillage times was reduced by 18.5 percent (in the old liberated areas with a better production base, it will be restored to the pre-war level). ② Lack of fertilizer: The lack of fertilizer in cotton fields is one of the reasons for the decrease in cotton yield. In terms of the amount of fertilizer applied, the average reduction of fertilizer in paddy fields and dry land is 30.24 percent. Some farmers apply more fertilizer to grain-producing land and less fertilizer to cotton land in order to increase food production. In some areas, due to the serious lack of fertilizer, no base fertilizer is applied before sowing, and some farmers even specifically reserve thin land for cotton fields. For example, the soil in general cotton fields in North China is extremely deficient in nitrogen, and coupled with the reduction in the amount of manure in recent years compared with the pre-war period, the organic matter in the soil is even more lacking, which is not conducive to the growth of cotton and even leads to serious diseases. ③ Cotton field irrigation: According to the cotton planting experience in various regions, irrigated cotton fields often produce one-third or more than dry land cotton fields. In the past few years, although the paddy fields in some old liberated areas have increased slightly, from a national perspective, the irrigation facilities in cotton fields have been destroyed and have not yet fully recovered to the pre-war level, which has reduced the irrigation area of cotton fields. In North China, Northwest China, and parts of East China and Central China, there are droughts nine years out of ten. In the spring when cotton is sown, there are often spring droughts, which prevent cotton from being sown on time. If the drought lasts for too long, in some areas, the seedlings are not caught even after sowing two or three times, and only water can be carried for spot planting. Cotton with spot planting requires too much labor, and the sowing area has to be reduced. After sowing, the seedlings often cannot grow well due to continuous drought, and there are phenomena such as missing seedlings and drought withering, as well as delaying the maturity period of cotton, increasing the number of frost-damaged flowers and late-stage cotton bolls. ④ Pests and diseases: In recent years, the loss of cotton due to pests has become increasingly serious, which is also an important reason for the reduction of production. Therefore, the masses are extremely eager to prevent and control pests. The main pests that have occurred in cotton this year are: cotton aphids (oil drought), red spiders (fire dragon), and cotton bollworms (cotton seed worms), especially cotton aphids, which are very harmful. The phenomenon of cotton aphids occurring every year in cotton-producing areas and reducing cotton production by 10-20 percent is common. Red spiders are more common in cotton-planting areas in North China this year, directly hindering the mid-term growth of cotton crops. Cotton bollworms are even more serious this year. The seed cotton of the affected cotton bolls mostly becomes stiff petals. According to statistics in Cheng'an cotton-producing area, 56 percent of the seed cotton has become stiff petals. According to the statistics of Tongxian Cotton Farm of North China Cotton Improvement Office, 16 percent of the cotton seeds are damaged by cotton bollworms. In other regions, the damage rate of cotton seeds is also mostly above 10 percent, which reduces cotton production and lowers the grade and quality of cotton. Secondly, the reduction of production due to diseases is also very serious. For example, 15-30 percent of the cotton in Anyang County is damaged by black fruit disease, and 50 percent of the cotton fields in Cheng'an have suffered from root rot and wilt disease. ⑤ Cotton field waterlogging: Water accumulation in cotton fields is not suitable for drainage, which seriously affects the yield and quality of cotton. Every year, some areas suffer from reduced harvests due to water damage, especially this year, such as Jiangsu Province, where the average yield this year is only 15 catties, and the average yield in the northeastern part of Hebei Province is only 14-15 catties due to water damage.

　　Due to the above reasons, the average yield of lint cotton per mu was reduced from 26 catties in 1936 to 21.3 catties in 1949. The yield per unit area decreased by 18 percent compared with the pre-war period.

　　II.

　　Now that we have found the main reasons for the above-mentioned production reduction, we must prescribe the right medicine and clearly implement the policy of stimulating cotton production.

　　1. Guarantee a reasonable cotton price: The government should openly guarantee the minimum cotton-grain price ratio standard (a minimum of 8 catties of rice for one catty of medium-grade American cotton lint is a fairly appropriate standard at present). At the same time, there must be organized regulation and supply of food, especially in cotton-producing areas where food sources are difficult to obtain, to ensure that cotton farmers can buy grain at reasonable prices when they sell cotton. In addition, the policy of "good cotton, good price" should be earnestly implemented to encourage cotton farmers to improve the quality of cotton and protect their due interests.

　　2. Use cotton to pay agricultural tax: In order to take care of the lack of grain in cotton-producing areas, implement the payment of agricultural tax in cotton. In principle, the conversion ratio should be based on the prices announced by the government. At the same time, the proportion of summer tax in concentrated cotton field areas should be exempted or reduced, and collected together in autumn to regulate the difficulty of food in cotton-producing areas.

　　3. Develop cooperative organizations in cotton-producing areas: Cotton must be processed, and more than 90 percent is commercial production. Therefore, in cotton-producing areas with conditions, cooperatives should be developed immediately to regulate food, feed, and fuel in cotton-producing areas, and to handle the processing, transportation, and sales of cotton products, so as to avoid the manipulation and exploitation of middlemen. At the same time, through the organization of cooperatives, it is convenient to collectively improve cotton production.

　　4. Issue cotton loans: Cotton production loans should be mainly used for special purposes and for lending in kind, such as fine cotton seeds, bean cakes and chemical fertilizers, small-scale improved agricultural tools, and medicines and machinery for preventing and controlling pests and diseases. The cotton production improvement agencies should make overall plans and work with the cooperatives to manage the issuance, lend out physical objects, convert them into seed cotton, and repay them in autumn.

　　5. Unify state-owned cotton purchasing institutions and implement grading inspection: In order to improve the quality of cotton and effectively protect the interests of cotton farmers, it is necessary to implement organized unified purchasing, set up state-owned professional cotton purchasing institutions, formulate cotton grade identification standards and specimens, and strictly implement grading inspection. Persist in ensuring an appropriate ratio of cotton to grain prices and good prices for good cotton, protect the interests of cotton farmers, and stimulate increased cotton production.

　　Secondly, in order to achieve increased production, according to the current specific situation in rural areas, the following series of specific tasks must be done well.

　　1. Select soil and increase fertilization: Many areas do not pay attention to selecting suitable soil for cotton planting and do not fertilize or fertilize less. It is necessary to pay attention to the reasons for the reduction of cotton production due to soil relations in various places and make appropriate improvements. Guide farmers to use sandy soil with medium fertility or above as much as possible to plant cotton. China's cotton-producing areas generally lack nitrogen, and now it has become a serious problem. Therefore, increasing fertilizer in cotton fields is the most effective way to increase cotton production at present, and it is the main reliance for increasing cotton production by 20 percent next year. Various places should use the slack season to organize the masses to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, promote and popularize the experience and methods of accumulating fertilizer in various places over the years, and pay special attention to supplying coal to solve fuel problems and save a large amount of firewood for fertilizer. Plan to promote and popularize the supplementary application of chemical fertilizers.

　　2. Prevention and control of pests and diseases: It is the most important way to increase cotton production. It is necessary to find effective prevention and control methods that are suitable for various places (preferably locally available) and are simple and easy to implement, and to thoroughly implement prevention and control technology among the masses and mobilize the masses to prevent and control pests. At present, the prevention and control of cotton aphids and red spiders in North China, Northeast China, and parts of Central China has more such conditions. The main agents rely on tobacco water, lime sulfur mixture, and flour mixture, and the popular use of hot water soaking method. In addition, it is necessary to prepare as many medicinal materials as possible, strengthen technical guidance, focus on cotton areas that promote improved varieties, implement progressive scientific prevention and control methods, and conduct demonstrations in places where promotion is needed.

　　3. Improve cotton planting and cultivation techniques: Cotton field cultivation requires less labor and more labor, which is most suitable for mobilizing women and children to participate in cotton field work, but attention should be paid to technical guidance. In response to the shortcomings in cotton planting techniques in various places, crop rotation should be promoted. In addition, we must also pay attention to the early growth of cotton, pay attention to appropriate planting distance (in many places, the row spacing and plant spacing of American cotton are too dense, and some row spacing is even smaller than plant spacing, and overemphasize large row spacing, etc.), improve the bad habit of intercropping other crops in cotton fields: ...etc.

　　4. Drought prevention and flood control: In addition to expanding the irrigation area of cotton fields, we should also organize water collection and spot planting in arid areas, drought resistance, and seedling protection, and more hoeing to prevent drought. Various experiences have proved that these are very successful methods. The cotton areas in the Yangtze River basin and some cotton areas in North China suffer great losses due to excessive rainfall and flooding of rivers every year. In addition to paying attention to large drainage projects and preventing flood disasters, we should also vigorously promote the planting of high-ridge cotton so that accumulated water can be discharged from the deep ditches between rows.

　　5. Promote improved cotton varieties and advocate mass seed selection: Most of the existing cotton seeds of farmers are mixed, inferior, and degraded, and a large area of ​​Zhongmian (intermediate cotton) is still maintained. This is one of the main reasons for the reduction of cotton production. It is necessary to expand the promotion of fine American cotton, and at the same time, we should advocate mass seed selection activities, generally improve the original cotton seeds of farmers, and systematically reduce the area of ​​Zhongmian.

　　棉花增产的途径
    张广居
    一
    中国原棉产量据统计最高曾达一、七○○万市担，一九四九年统计则仅达八○○多万市担，几乎相差一倍，因之如何促进棉花增产，实为当前亟需研究的一个问题。要想找到增产的正确途径，首先须认识历年来棉花减产的原因，据我个人的见解：一为棉田面积减少，一为单位面积的减产。
    棉田面积减少的原因：（１）棉区粮食供应不能保证，棉粮比价的不合理，为减少棉田面积的基本原因。这种原因的形成，是由于过去敌人长期的封锁分割及交通的破坏阻塞，形成物资交流的非正常状态，加上日寇的掠夺摧残，致使产棉区粮贵棉贱（产粮区则粮贱棉贵），棉贱伤农，植棉不仅无利可图，且影响到棉农生活（一九三六年一斤皮棉合小米一一．八斤，日寇统治时期一九三八至一九四三年一斤皮棉合小米五．二八五斤，一九四六年至一九四八年一斤皮棉合小米七．五二斤）。其次，由于各种灾害的增多，食粮缺乏，亦使农民不敢大量植棉。（２）由于过去日寇、国民党反动派的掠夺破坏，劳畜力减少，棉花栽培较一般食用作物费工多，在植棉无显著利益的条件下，加以劳畜力困难，棉田势必减少。又因交通的不便，燃料调剂困难，棉区农民为解决燃料，多播种高秆作物，亦影响棉田面积缩减。（３）由于土地分散，农民首先要种植相当数量的食用作物，其次才种棉花，因之也使植棉面积不易扩大。
    根据上述原因，据手头材料统计，一九三七年全国棉田面积为六、二○○万亩，占全国总耕地面积一四一、九○○万亩的百分之四．三七。一九四九年的全国棉田面积仅达三、九○○万亩，占全国总耕地面积百分之二．七。
    棉田单位面积减产原因：①由于劳畜力缺乏，棉花耕作技术也随之降低。在耕地的次数上是减少了，过去能耕两遍的，现在仅耕了一遍，只进行春耕而不进行冬耕，而且耕的很浅，妨碍了棉株的生长。在中耕次数上也减少了，一般只锄到三、四次，有的仅锄两次。在播种时间上，也因劳畜力的限制不能按照季节及时播种，再加上棉田管理技术的粗放，都能使棉花减产。根据最近不完全调查，一九四八年比战前降低耕地次数百分之二○．一七，耙的次数平均降低百分之一二．二二，中耕次数平均降低百分之一八．五（在生产基础较好的老解放区将恢复到战前水平）。②肥料缺乏：棉田肥料缺乏是棉花降低产量的原因之一，在施肥数量上，水、旱地平均减少百分之三○．二四，有的农户为了增加食粮生产，将肥料多施于产粮地，少施于棉花地。有些地区因为肥料严重缺乏，下种以前即不施基肥，并有专留薄地作棉田的。如华北一般棉田土壤本极缺乏氮素，再加上圈肥数量近年比战前减少，土中有机物更显缺乏，以致不利于棉花的生长，甚至酿成严重的病害。③棉田灌溉问题：根据各地区植棉经验，灌溉的棉田常比旱地棉田多产三分之一或一倍以上。几年以来个别老解放区水田虽略有增加，但从全国来看，棉田灌溉设备已经破坏，至今尚未完全恢复战前水平，因而使棉田灌溉面积减少。在华北、西北及华东、华中的部分地区，十年九旱，在春季棉花播种时常遭春旱，使棉花不能按时播种。如遇旱时过久，有些地区，种两三次亦未捉苗，只有组织挑水点种。凡点种的棉花，因需用劳力过多，不得不减少播种面积。播种以后幼苗常因继续天旱不能很好生长，并发生缺苗旱枯现象，以及延迟了棉花的成熟期，增加霜后花及晚期棉桃。④病虫害问题：几年以来棉花受虫害的损失日趋严重，亦为减产重要原因之一，因此群众要求防治极为迫切。今年棉花所发生的虫害，最主要的有：棉蚜虫（油旱）、红蜘蛛（火龙）、红铃虫（棉子虫），尤以棉蚜虫为害甚大，在棉产区每年都有棉蚜发生，棉花产量减产百分之一○——二○的是常有现象。红蜘蛛今年在华北植棉地区发生比较普遍，直接妨害了棉作中期生长。红铃虫今年更严重，被害的棉铃籽棉多变成僵瓣，在成安棉产区统计：籽棉变成僵瓣的有百分之五六。另据华北棉产改进处通县棉场统计，被红铃虫为害的棉子占百分之一六。其他地区棉子被害率也多在百分之十以上，既减少棉花产量，又降低棉花品级与品质。其次因病害的减产亦甚严重，如安阳县被黑果病侵害的就占有百分之一五——三○，成安部分棉田有百分之五○，遭受了根腐委凋病。⑤棉田挑水问题：棉田积水不宜宣泄，严重的影响了棉花的产量与质量，每年都有一部分地区因水害歉收，尤以今年为严重，如江苏今年平均产量仅一五斤，河北之东北部因水害平均产量亦仅达十四五斤。
    由于以上原因，由一九三六年每亩平均皮棉产量二六市斤，降低到一九四九年的每亩平均二一．三市斤。每一单位面积较抗日战争前减低百分之一八。
    二
    既然找到了上述的减产主要原因，就必须对症下药，明确贯彻执行刺激棉花增产的政策。
    一、保证合理棉价：政府要公开保证最低限度的棉粮比价标准（一斤中级美棉皮棉最低换米八斤是目前相当合适的标准。）同时须有组织的进行食粮的调剂和供应。尤其是粮食来源困难的棉区，保证棉农售出棉花，能购到合理价格的粮食。此外还应认真执行良棉优价政策，鼓励棉农提高棉花品质，保障他们应得的利益。
    二、棉花代征公粮：照顾棉区缺粮，实行以棉花折交公粮。折合比率，原则上应按政府公布的价格，同时在棉田集中区应免去或减少夏征比例，于秋季一并征收，以调剂棉区食粮的困难。
    三、发展棉区合作社的组织：棉花须经过加工，且百分之九十以上是商品生产，因之有条件的棉区，要立即发展合作社，调剂棉区食粮、饲料和燃料，办理棉产的加工运销，避免中间商人的操纵和剥削，同时通过合作社的组织，便于集体性的改进棉花生产工作。
    四、发放棉贷：棉产贷款，应以专款专用及贷放实物为主，如优良棉种、豆饼和化学肥料、小型改良农具、防除病虫的药械等。由棉产改进机关统筹计划，会同合作社掌握发放，贷出实物，折成籽棉，秋后偿还。
    五、统一国营棉花收购机构，历行分级检验：为了提高棉花品质，切实保障棉农利益，必须实行有组织的统一收购，普设国营的专业收花机构，制定棉花等级鉴定标准和标本，严格实施分级检验。坚持保证棉粮适当比价和良棉优价，保障棉农利益，刺激棉花增产。
    其次要做到增产，根据当前农村的具体情况，必须做好下列一系列的具体工作。
    一、选择土壤和增施肥料：许多地区不注意选择适宜土壤植棉和不施肥或少施肥的习惯，必须重视各地因土壤关系影响棉花减产的原因，并予以适当的改善。指导农民尽可能选用中等肥度以上的砂质土壤种植棉花。我国棉区普遍缺氮，现更形成严重问题，故增加棉田肥料是当前提高棉花产量最有效的办法，是明年棉花增产二成的主要依靠，各地应利用农闲季节组织群众大量积肥，发扬与推广历年各地积肥经验与积肥方法，并特别注意供应煤炭解决燃料，节省出大量柴草用作肥料，有计划地提倡和推广化学肥料补充施用。
    二、防除病虫害：是使棉花增产最重要的办法，必须找出适合各地方（最好能就地取才的），和简便易行的有效防治方法，将防治技术深入贯彻到群众里去，发动群众普遍来防治，目前比较具有这样条件的是华北、东北及华中部分地区的棉蚜和红蜘蛛的防治。药剂主要依靠烟草水、石灰硫磺合剂和面粉剂，及普遍使用开水浸种的方法。此外必须尽量准备一大批药材，加强技术指导，以推广良种的棉区为主，实施进步科学方法的防治，并在需要推广的地方，进行示范。
    三、提高植棉耕作技术：棉田耕作轻劳动较多，最适宜于动员妇女儿童参加棉田工作，但须注意技术的指导，针对各地植棉技术上的缺点，提倡轮作。此外还需注重棉花早期生长，注意适当的栽植距离（许多地方美棉的行株距，都有太密的毛病，有的行距竟比株距还小，以及过分强调大株行距等），改进棉田夹种其他作物的坏习惯：……等。
    四、防旱防涝：除扩大棉田灌溉面积外，并在旱区组织挑水点植，抗旱保苗及多锄防旱等。各种经验证明，这些都是很成功的办法，长江流域棉区和华北部分棉区，每年因雨水太多和河水泛滥，遭受水害的损失很大，除注意大的排水工程和防止水患工作外，还应大力提倡种高垄棉花，使积水从行与行间之深沟排出。
    五、推广优良棉种和倡导群众选种：农民现有棉种大部杂劣退化，且还保持有广大面积的中棉，这是减低棉产的主要原因之一，须扩大推广优良美棉，同时并应倡导群众选种运动，普遍提高农民原有的棉种及有步骤地减少中棉面积。
