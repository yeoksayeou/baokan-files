　　The Budding of New Teacher-Student Relationships
　　——A Record of the "Manufacturing Internship" of the Fourth Grade of Tsinghua Mechanical Engineering Department
　　"Metalworking Internship" is the most basic technical training for us studying mechanical engineering in factories. But we didn't pay attention to it in the second and third grades. This time when we went to the Northeast for internship, we felt the pain of not having learned metalworking well. As soon as we came back, we universally asked to learn. "Manufacturing Internship" is a new course opened by the department to supplement our metalworking training.
　　The first lesson of the internship was a discussion between teachers and students about the specific content and plan of the internship.
　　After the internship started, because the students chose a particularly large number of credits this semester and were busy with their studies, the "Manufacturing Internship" was neglected by the students. Among us, there was a general phenomenon of laxity. Tardiness, leaving early, carelessness. The internship only lasted for three weeks, and six tools were damaged.
　　In order to correct the deviations in learning, a review meeting was called. In the past, teachers could have ignored these "idle matters," but now the attitude is not like that. They actively and patiently helped us overcome the shortcomings in our learning. At the meeting, the teachers made self-criticisms. Mr. Liu Jincheng said sincerely: "The manufacturing internship was not done well because we neglected the leadership in teaching and had no plan. Ideologically, we have always regarded this course as an additional job." This frank and responsible spirit deeply moved us.
　　They also criticized our incorrect learning viewpoints without any politeness. For example, some students chose this course only to touch new machines. As soon as they heard about it, they wanted to draw diagrams first, so they didn't use their brains and were not interested in the work. Some students cared about face and were embarrassed to ask about "small problems," but the teachers said, "There is nothing to be embarrassed about between teachers and students."
　　When discussing future learning methods, the teachers put forward specific methods: the work to be done next week should be arranged this week, and some reference books should be found for the students, so that the students can understand it in advance. They suggested that students write reports, write down the work steps in detail, and then they would correct them for the students.
　　When talking about the problem of damaged tools, Liu Zuxin said very moved: "I damaged two tools in the last internship. Now that I think about it, it was entirely due to carelessness. At that time, I thought that as long as I could learn something and there were no major problems, that would be fine. I didn't expect the difficulty of adding equipment at present, and I didn't even think that the school would train talents for the country for a long time, and that one less tool would hinder many people's learning."
　　In the review meeting, the atmosphere of the meeting was serious, and therefore everyone's mood was a bit heavy. Mr. Zhang Jing encouraged us and said: "Don't be afraid of damaging tools, and then be timid and afraid to support the machine, losing confidence. The main purpose of our meeting today is to review the shortcomings so that our learning can be carried out better in the future."
　　Through this review meeting, we experienced the new teacher-student relationship - "teachers and students help each other, teaching each other." Our manufacturing internship has also entered a new stage. The internship group is organized more tightly, and the leadership and planning in learning can also be carried out step by step. After deep reflection and review, the students overcame the previous tendency of not cherishing and not being responsible for the property of the people's motherland, and initially achieved the learning attitude of "boldness and care." Now it has been three weeks, and there has been no incident of damage to tools or machines.
　　We must not only "attach importance to cooperation between teachers and students and between students," but also further consolidate and develop the new teacher-student relationship.

　　新师生关系的萌芽
    ——记清华机械系四年级的“制造实习”
    “金工实习”是我们学机械工程的在工厂中最基本的技术训练。而我们在二三年级的时候，都没注意它。这次去东北实习，才感到没学好金工的苦痛。一回来，普遍地要求学习。“制造实习”就是系里为补助我们的金工训练而开设的新课。
    实习的第一课便是师生一块讨论实习的具体内容和进行的计划。
    实习开始以后，由于这学期同学选的学分特别多，功课一忙，“制造实习”便被同学忽视了。在我们当中，普遍地存在着松懈的现象。迟到早退，粗心大意。实习只进行了三周，毁坏的工具便有六件。
    为了纠正学习中发生的偏向，召集了一次检讨会。在以前，教师本可以不管这些“闲事”，现在不是这样的态度了。他们积极耐心地帮助我们克服学习中的缺点。在会上教师们作了自我检讨。刘金铖先生诚恳地说：“制造实习没搞好，是因为我们疏忽了教学上的领导，没有计划，在思想上还一直把这门课看作另加的工作。”这种坦白认真负责的精神，深深地感动了我们。
    对我们不正确的学习观点，他们也毫不客气地作了批判。象有的同学选这门课，目的只在摸摸新机器，一听就先要绘图，便不伤脑筋，对工作不感兴趣了。有的同学爱面子，遇到“小问题”，便不好意思问，但教师们都说：“师生之间没有什么不好意思的”。
    在讨论今后学习方式时，教师提出了具体的办法：下星期要做的工作，在这一星期便安排好，并且要为同学找一些参考书，让同学事先把弄明白。他们建议同学写报告，详细写下工作步骤，他们再给同学改正。
    谈到损坏工具的问题时，刘祖忻同学非常感动地说：“我上次实习弄坏了两件工具，现在想来，完全由于粗心。当时以为只要自己能学到东西，不出大乱子就算了。没想到目前添置设备的艰难，更没想到学校要为国家长期培养人才，少一件工具就妨碍了多少人学习。”
    在检讨会中，会场的空气是严肃的，因之每个人的心情有些沉重。张儆先生便鼓励着我们说：“不要怕损坏工具，便一直畏手畏脚，不敢支机器，失却了信心。我们今天的会，主要在检讨缺点，让我们的学习以后进行得更好。”
    经过这次检讨会，我们体验到了新的师生关系——“师生互助，教学相长”。我们的制造实习也步入了新的阶段。实习小组组织得更严密了，学习上的领导与计划也能按步就班进行了。同学们在深刻地反省检讨以后，克服了以前对人民祖国财产不爱护不负责的偏向，初步地做到了“胆大心细”的学习态度。到现在又已三周，再没有发生过一件损坏工具或机器的事件。
    我们不但要“重视师生之间及同学彼此之间合作”，而且还要把新的师生关系进一步的巩固和发扬。
