　　CPC Licheng County Committee
    Gains Experience in Rotating Training of Party Members
    Concentrating Efforts to Transform Party Members' Thinking, Concise and Focused Curriculum, Connecting with Inspection of Branch Work.
    [Report from this newspaper] The first phase of the rural Party member training class run by the CPC Licheng County Committee concluded on the 16th of last month. The 192 Party members who received training understood the prospects for revolutionary development and cleared up the lax thinking of some people who mistakenly believed that the revolution had been completely successful; after studying the mass line, they criticized, in connection with their actual work, work styles such as commandism or tailism; after studying the Party Constitution, everyone expressed their determination to build the branch well and unanimously requested to strengthen learning and improve the proletarian ideological level of Party members of peasant origin. At the same time, the organizational work of the branch was discussed, and specific issues of production leadership in each village were studied.
    The training class lasted only ten days. In order to achieve these results in such a short period, the Licheng County Committee provided the following points of experience in its summary:
    (1) Have a clear educational policy, with everything revolving around transforming the thinking of Party members and improving their awareness. The County Party Secretary and the Minister of Propaganda personally led the classes and strengthened the daily leadership of the training class, inspiring the learning enthusiasm of the students, absorbing the organizational branches of the district committees, and absorbing the outstanding branch committees of each village to form the backbone of learning and promote learning. In addition, constantly use individual conversations, small classes, and other methods to cultivate activists, mobilize the learning enthusiasm of all students, launch a learning competition, and create a mass learning upsurge, so that some of the poorer learners also become active.
    (2) Grasp the principle of concise and focused education content, mainly using lectures and question-and-answer methods, combined with organized discussions. Each lecture is not greedy for quantity, but grasps the spirit of timely and in-depth discussions, with good results. In the past, training classes would have a full day of lectures followed by two or three days of continuous discussion, so that students would forget what was said in the lectures during the discussion. This problem has been corrected.
    (3) Master the method of combining theory with practice. After explaining a problem, immediately grasp the spirit of this to examine the thinking and work of each branch, induce everyone to speak, and say out various correct and incorrect understandings, and then let everyone argue and analyze. At the same time, control the progress of the discussion to avoid it becoming empty talk or getting caught up in trivialities.

　　中共黎城县委会
    轮训党员获经验
    集中力量改造党员思想，课程少而精，联系检查支部工作。
    【本报讯】中共黎城县委会开办的农村党员训练班，第一期已于上月十六日结束。受训的一九二名党员，认识了革命发展的前途，清除了一部分人错误地认为革命已经完全成功的松懈思想；经过对群众线路的研究，联系实际工作批判了强迫命令或尾巴主义等工作作风；在学习党章之后，大家纷纷表示决心把支部建设好，并一致要求加强学习，提高农民出身的党员之无产阶级思想水平。同时，又讨论了支部组织工作，具体研究了各村生产领导问题。
    训练班受训日期仅十天，在短期内能获这些成绩，黎城县委在总结中提供了几点经验：
    （一）有明确的教育方针，一切围绕改造党员思想与提高党员觉悟来进行。县委书记和宣传部长亲自领导上课，并加强训练班的日常领导，启发广大学员的学习积极性，吸收各区分委组织总支，吸收各村优秀支委组织分支，由他们构成学习骨干，推动学习。另外，不断地用个别谈话、上小课等方式，培养积极分子，发动全体学员的学习积极性，展开学习竞赛，造成群众性的学习热潮。使一些学习较差的也转趋积极。
    （二）教育内容掌握少而精的原则，主要采用讲课与解答问题的方式，结合组织讨论。每次讲课不贪多，抓紧及时的深入的讨论，结果很好。以往办训练班，上一整天课再连续讨论两三天，以致讨论时学员把上课讲的忘记了，这种毛病已得到纠正。
    （三）掌握理论与实际相结合的方法。讲了一个问题，即掌握此精神去检查思想与各个支部的工作，诱导大家发言，说出各种正确的与不正确的认识，再由大家争论、分析，同时掌握讨论会的进行，以免流于空论或钻牛角尖。
