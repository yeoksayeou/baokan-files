Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th -- According to a TASS report from London, the British Labor government decided on November 16th to postpone the steel industry nationalization bill, which was passed by the House of Commons on May 9th this year, until after next year's general election. The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the 18th stating that this decision was "a voluntary surrender by the government to the demands of British steel tycoons and Wall Street." The statement also pointed out that as the general election approaches, the leaders of the Conservative and Labor parties are getting closer and closer, and the Labor Party has betrayed the interests of the working class. Only the resolute struggle of organized workers can defeat this betrayal by the Labor Party.

Nationalization of the steel industry was one of the important promises in the Labor Party's 1945 election platform. However, the Labor government did not submit this bill to the House of Commons until October 27, 1948, and it was only passed by the House of Commons this May, after the Labor Party suffered a disastrous defeat in the local elections, in an attempt to reverse the Labor Party's political decline. However, when completing the final legislative procedure on the 16th of this month, the Labor Party actually accepted the so-called "compromise plan" and agreed to postpone the implementation of steel industry nationalization until after next year's general election. According to the opinions of the London Observer quoted by the Electric News Agency, this decision in fact means completely abandoning the nationalization of the steel industry, because the Labor Party may not get an absolute majority in next year's general election. Therefore, accepting the "compromise plan" is to leave a way out for forming a "coalition government" with the Conservative Party.

### 英共执委会发表声明　斥工党政府投降美帝　拖延实施钢铁工业国有化

　　英共执委会发表声明
    斥工党政府投降美帝
    拖延实施钢铁工业国有化
    【新华社北京三十日电】据塔斯社伦敦讯，英国工党政府于十一月十六日决定将今年五月九日在下院通过的钢铁工业国有化法案，延至明年大选后实施。英国共产党执行委员会十八日发表声明称，此项决定是“政府自愿地对英国钢铁大亨和华尔街要求的投降。”声明并指出，大选日益迫近，保守党和工党领袖也越来越靠拢，工党出卖了工人阶级的利益，只有有组织的工人的坚决斗争，才能击败工党的这种背叛。
    按钢铁工业国有化，是一九四五年工党竞选纲领中的重要诺言之一。但工党政府迟至一九四八年十月二十七日，才向下院提出此项法案，直到今年五月，工党在地方选举惨败之后，才由下院予以通过，企图借此挽回工党在政治上的颓势。但在本月十六日完成最后立法程序时，工党竟又接受所谓“折衷方案”，同意把实施钢铁工业国有化的日期，延至明年大选以后。据电通社引伦敦观察家的意见，这一决定事实上意味着完全抛弃钢铁工业国有化，因为明年大选，工党可能得不到绝对多数，所以接受“折衷方案”，是为了与保守党成立“联合政府”留一后路。
