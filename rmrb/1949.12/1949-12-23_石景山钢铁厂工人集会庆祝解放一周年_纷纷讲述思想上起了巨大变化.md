　　Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Workers Gather to Celebrate the First Anniversary of Liberation
　　Sharing the Tremendous Changes in Their Thinking
　　[Beijing News] The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held a commemorative evening on the 18th of this month to celebrate the first anniversary of liberation. At the meeting, workers shared the tremendous changes in their thinking, work, and life over the past year; the meeting also observed a moment of silence to pay tribute to the Liberation Army soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the liberation of the plant. Zhang Youyi, a worker at the mechanical plant, said, "In the year since liberation, I feel that I have been making progress day by day. In the past, I used to loaf on the job, but now I not only work actively, but also participate in amateur schools and technical classes after work." Worker Liu Xuehai said, "I don't know what to say, I just feel happy from the bottom of my heart. Today, the white flour we eat, the clothes we wear, and the houses we live in have all been greatly improved and guaranteed compared to the past. There will no longer be any worries in life." Yang Kaiwen, Deputy Director of the Labor Union, said, "It is not easy for us to be masters of our own affairs. We must contribute our strength on the production front to overcome difficulties and speed up production, and use actual production achievements to celebrate the first anniversary of the plant's liberation."

    纷纷讲述思想上起了巨大变化
    【北京讯】石景山钢铁厂于本月十八日举行庆祝解放一周年纪念晚会，工人们在会上讲述了一年来在思想上、工作上、生活上所起的巨大变化；会上并为解放该厂牺牲的解放军战士们默念致哀。机械厂工人张有义说：“解放后一年中，自己感到一天比一天进步，过去磨洋工，现在不但积极干活，下工后还参加了业余学校、技术班。”工人刘学海说：“我不知该说什么好，只是从心眼里痛快，今天吃的白面，穿的衣服，住的房子都比过去得到了极大的改善与保障，生活上绝不会再有什么顾虑了。”工会副主任杨开文说：“我们当家作主人不是容易的事，我们要在生产战线上拿出我们的力量来克服困难，加紧生产，以实际的生产成绩，来庆祝工厂解放的一周年。”
