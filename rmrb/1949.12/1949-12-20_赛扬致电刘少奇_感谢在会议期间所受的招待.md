Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, sent a telegram to Liu Shaoqi, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, when leaving Chinese territory, to express his gratitude for the hospitality received during the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference. The telegram is as follows:

Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions:

As we are about to leave the territory of the People's Republic of China, the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions extends to you its warmest respects and gratitude for your fraternal hospitality, which will make our stay in your country unforgettable. We express our gratitude for your valuable assistance in ensuring the success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference. The decisive victory of the Chinese people in their national liberation war is a supreme example, a most valuable lesson, and the greatest inspiration for the Trade Union Conference. This conference is a significant event in the history of the world workers' movement and its progress. This conference will further consolidate the ties between us and our common will to resolutely oppose imperialism – the instigators of new wars.

Long live the All-China Federation of Trade Unions!

Long live the great Chinese people and their working class!

Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
December 6, 1949
