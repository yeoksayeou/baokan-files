Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, December 15th: The People's Liberation Army, advancing along the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, pursued the enemy day and night, liberating Guangyuan County, Northern Sichuan, at 10:00 AM on the 14th. On the same day, at dusk, they controlled the Jialing River ferry, capturing over 1,200 enemy troops from the 177th and 55th Divisions of the 38th Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, December 11th: The Kuomintang Navy's Yangtze River Defense Fleet warships, Yong'an and Hao Xue, revolted on the Yangtze River near Zhong County, Sichuan, on the morning of November 29th. Under the leadership of Captains Nie Xiyu and Ji Shilu, they broke through the Kuomintang's blockade and gunfire along the river and arrived at a certain liberated area. Along the way, they were warmly welcomed and comforted by the people, Party, government, and military organizations in various liberated areas.

Also reported: During the People's Liberation Army's operations at the end of last month to liberate Chongqing and its surrounding areas, the Kuomintang River Defense Guard Regiment, led by Deputy Regiment Commander Wei Bingquan, along with a part of the Communications Corps, totaling 2,000 men, surrendered to the People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, December 15th: The "Hai Jie" and "Hai Zhou" anti-smuggling boats under the jurisdiction of the Kuomintang Ministry of Finance's Guangdong-Guangxi Salt Affairs Bureau, led by captains He Zitang and Liang Tianlu, broke away from the Kuomintang Movement faction and turned to the People's Government. After the liberation of Guangzhou, the Kuomintang bandit army forced the two boats to sail to Hainan Island, but the patriotic officers and soldiers of the two boats refused the false order and sailed from the waters of Macau to a certain liberated area on the 8th of this month, where they were warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians.
