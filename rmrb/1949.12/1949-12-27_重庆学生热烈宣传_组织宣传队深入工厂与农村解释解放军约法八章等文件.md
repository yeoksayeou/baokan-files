　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 26th: Chongqing students are enthusiastically carrying out propaganda activities after liberation. More than 50,000 middle school and university students in the city enthusiastically welcomed and comforted the People's Liberation Army when it entered the city on November 30th, organizing service teams and propaganda teams, or inviting the PLA to hold get-togethers. Now, most schools have organized factory propaganda teams and rural propaganda teams to go deep into factories and rural areas to publicize the PLA's Eight Main Rules of Discipline and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, among other documents. Students from the Rural Construction Institute use "Gan Chang" (rural market days) to carry out propaganda work. When female students go to textile factories to conduct propaganda, they are often retained by the female workers. The propaganda team of the Central Industrial College has set regulations that for questions raised by the masses, they must only answer those they are certain about. Currently, most schools in the city have formally resumed classes, and the preparatory committee of the Municipal Student Federation has also been established. To welcome the first New Year after liberation, schools are actively preparing to hold a New Year Propaganda Week.

　　重庆学生热烈宣传
    组织宣传队深入工厂与农村解释解放军约法八章等文件
    【新华社重庆二十六日电】重庆学生解放后热烈进行宣传活动。全市大中学生五万多人，在十一月三十日人民解放军进入市区时，就广泛地展开了狂热的欢迎和慰问解放军工作，组织服务队、宣传队或邀请解放军举行联欢会。现在各校大多数组织了工厂宣传队、农村宣传队，深入工厂、农村、宣传解放军约法八章和人民政协共同纲领等。乡村建设学院学生利用“赶场”（农村集市）进行宣传工作。女同学们到纺织厂去宣传时，常为女工们挽留不放。中央工业专科学校的宣传队，预定纪律，对于群众提出的问题，必须确切知道的才作答复。现在全市各校多数已经正式复课，市学生联合会筹备委员会也已成立。为迎接解放后第一个新年，各校正积极准备举行新年宣传周的工作。
