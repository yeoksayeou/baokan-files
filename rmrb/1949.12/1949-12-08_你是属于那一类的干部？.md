A Word From the People

　　To Which Category of Cadre Do You Belong?
    Hu Ping
    Since everyone read Comrade Gao Gang's report "To Whom Does the Honor Belong?", it has been very enlightening to the comrades' thinking. Everyone is enthusiastically discussing and asking each other: "Comrade, to which category of cadre do you belong?" Yes, this is a serious and revolutionary progressive question. Let us use the spirit of this document to examine ourselves and answer this question.
    Faced with new revolutionary construction tasks, we need a new spirit of enterprise, requiring everyone to put forth all their energy and wisdom, put aside all personal plans, and work hard to complete the tasks. Those who can do this must have a correct and unwavering understanding of the interests of the individual and the interests of the revolution, knowing that the greatest interest of the people is the highest interest of the Communists, and even their own highest interest. Starting from this point is precisely what Comrade Gao Gang calls the "first category of cadres." They have a high degree of revolutionary consciousness and initiative, and therefore in their work they are "active and energetic, able to overcome difficulties in practical work, discover problems, solve problems, complete tasks and create new experiences, delve into their work, do not talk empty words, do not shout about difficulties, bury themselves in hard work, and accurately complete and exceed the plan"; these comrades are the honor of the Party, the people's excellent servants, and are worthy of our study.
    If we carefully examine ourselves, we will find that we are far from meeting this requirement.
    Among us, some people, when faced with arduous work, will waver and think: "The objective conditions are too difficult, no matter how great the subjective effort, it is useless." "I have no experience in this kind of work, I can't do it!" Or simply say: "My ability is not enough." Yes, objective difficulties exist, but for us, it is not a question of evading or succumbing, but of how to resolutely fight and overcome the difficulties. Insufficient personal ability and experience exists, but for a revolutionary like us, the ability to solve problems and complete tasks is not something else, but mainly our political cultivation. There is no difficulty in the work that a Communist cannot overcome. What must be overcome is the problem existing in one's own thinking.
    Sometimes we also have the idea of doing a good job, and we have the desire to improve our political level to improve our work, but in practice, we are still very lax: for example, reading the Party newspaper carelessly, being too lazy to seriously connect studying documents with ourselves, and our work is also not energetic, not strictly demanding in every small step of specific work to make it better. It seems that we are satisfied with a certain degree, sometimes busy all day long, and when we come back late at night and lie on the bed, we do not check how the actual results of today's work are, but comfort ourselves with "I have been busy all day today, I am responsible to the revolution, and I have not rested for five minutes," or shout in our mouths: "The organization should pay close attention to cadre study, otherwise we will not do our work well," but we have not even read the "Social Development History" study assigned last month. There are also some comrades who do not understand enough about "creativity and sensitivity to new things" in their work, thinking that this is innate, and they can only do some work in a conventional way. Creating new experiences and thinking of new ways can only be done by other comrades with "strong ability". Some comrades even misunderstand creativity as "petty cleverness," thinking that they can create new ways with a "flash of inspiration," and do not understand that "creativity" is generated from our daily work of studying objective things practically from the interests of the revolution, thinking deeply, and being determined to serve the people and learn from the people.
    "To Whom Does the Honor Belong?" explains how we should use a standard to measure ourselves, and more profoundly explains how to achieve the height required by the document. "To Which Category of Cadre Do You Belong?" This is what we should seriously ask ourselves.

### 你是属于那一类的干部？

　　你是属于那一类的干部？
    胡  平
    自从大家看到高岗同志的报告“荣誉是属于谁的？”后，对同志们思想上有很大启发，大家热烈讨论并互相问着：“同志，你是属于第几类的干部？”是的，这是一个严肃而富有革命进取精神的问题，让我们一起来以这个文件的精神来检查自己，来回答这个问题吧。
    在新的革命建设任务前，要求有新的事业精神，要求每个人拿出全部的精力和智慧，撇掉一切个人打算，尽力地工作来完成任务，能够这样做的人，必然是具有对个人利益和革命的利益有正确的和坚定不移的认识，知道人民最大的利益即是共产党人的最高利益，更是自己最高的利益，从这点出发的就正是高岗同志所说的“第一类干部”。他们具有高度的革命自觉性和进取心，因而在工作中是“积极努力，生龙活虎，能在实际工作中克服困难，发现问题，解决问题，完成伤务并创造新的经验，钻研工作，不讲空话，不喊困难，埋头苦干，很准确地完并超过计划”；这些同志是党的荣誉，人民的优秀的勤务员，是值得我们学习的。
    如果我们切实地把自己检查一下，就会发现我们是很够不上这个要求的。
    我们中间，有些人在工作艰巨的时候，就会动摇起来，想：“客观条件太困难了，主观努力再大也是没有用的。”“我对这种工作没有经验，干不了！”或是干脆说：“我能力不够。”是的，客观困难是存在的，但对我们来说，不是逃避或屈服的问题，而是如何坚决战斗，并战胜困难的问题。个人能力及经验不够是存在的，但对我们一个革命者来说，解决问题完成任务的能力不是别的，主要是我们的政治修养问题，共产党人是没有什么工作中的困难不能克服的。必须克服的倒是自己思想中存在的问题。
    我们有时也有把工作搞好的想法，有要求提高自己政治水平来改进工作的愿望，但是在实践中，却仍是很松懈的：如把党报粗枝大叶地看看，学习文件懒于认真地联系自己，工作也是不带劲的，不在每一项具体工作的细小步骤上都严格地要求把它作的更好，似乎作到一定程度便心满意足，有时整天忙忙乱乱，深夜回来往床上一躺，并不检查今天工作的实际成绩如何，只是以“我今天忙了一天，我是对革命负责的，没有休息过五分钟。”来安慰自己，或是嘴里嚷着：“组织上要抓紧干部学习啊，不然我们工作作不好，”但是自己连上个月布置的“社会发展史”学习还没有看过。还有些同志对工作中的“创造性及对新鲜事物的敏感性”了解不够，以为这是天生的，自己只能墨守成规地作些工作。创造新经验，想新鲜办法是其他“能力强”的同志才能做得到的，有些同志甚至误解创造性为“小聪明”，自己“灵机一动”就能创造出新的办法来，不了解“创造性”是由于我们从革命的利益出发，切实地研究客观事物，深思熟虑，决心为人民服务而又向人民群众学习的日常工作中产生出来的。
    “荣誉是属于谁的？”说明我们应该以怎样的一个标准来衡量自己，更深刻地说明怎样才能做到文件所要求的那样高度。“你是属于第几类干部？”这是我们应该严肃地问问自己的。
