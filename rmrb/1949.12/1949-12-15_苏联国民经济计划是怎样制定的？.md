　　How the Soviet National Economic Plan is Formulated?
　　By Walinte

　　The main tasks of the Soviet national economic plan are determined by the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government. For example, the decisive link in the first Soviet Five-Year Plan was the task of developing heavy industry centered on the machine manufacturing industry. In the second and third Five-Year Economic Plans, the basic links were the main sectors of heavy industry - the metallurgical industry, the machine manufacturing industry, the fuel industry, the power industry, and the chemical industry. In the post-war Soviet Five-Year Plan, the primary task was to develop fuel extraction, ferrous metallurgy, power stations, and railway transportation.

　　Formulating a plan is a long-term and arduous task. First, it is necessary to summarize the past period. Then, the state planning agency issues instructions for formulating a new national economic plan, using the economic and historical tasks of the time as the starting point for its formulation. In other words, it determines the main links of the new five-year plan. Again, a draft plan is drawn up, which must be approved by the government. After this, it enters the decisive period - organizing the implementation of the plan.

　　The approved national economic plan has the force of law. Stalin's instructions on this matter were: Soviet plans are not predictions, not conjectures, but instructions that must be carried out. The Soviet Union formulates this plan scientifically, and it is the work program of all Soviet economic organs, enterprises, and the entire people - these are the creators of the plan.

　　What does the Soviet national economic plan include? The national economic plan first regulates the production plans of each industrial and agricultural sector. The plan itself includes the technical and economic conditions of production. In other words, it includes the quality of products, technological methods, raw materials, material and fuel consumption quotas, as well as the amount of labor and cost input. The national economy usually includes a vast construction program. The plan also predetermines the distribution of social products. A portion of the products is used to offset production costs, another portion is used to expand production and as a national reserve fund. In addition, a portion is extracted as an administrative fund, and a fund to meet social needs - for education and healthcare; at the same time, there is also a fund to consolidate national defense. The remaining portion of social products is enjoyed by producers according to the quantity and quality of labor expended. The plan also determines the quantity of commodity circulation and capital - thereby determining the work of transportation agencies and commercial organizations.

　　Labor-related measures occupy the most important position in the plan: allocating labor according to economic sectors, increasing labor productivity, stipulating wages, improving labor mechanization, etc., as well as training a large number of skilled workers in technical schools, railway schools, and factory apprentice schools. Finally, the economic plan contains a fiscal plan. Therefore, the funds contained in the national economic plan are the basic indicators of the entire Soviet national economic development.

　　The Soviet national economic plan includes the tasks of the entire industry, the tasks of the entire machine manufacturing industry, the tasks of the entire timber industry, etc., this is the so-called sectoralization of the economic plan. At the same time, inter-sectoral plans must also be formulated. The economic plan contains programs to guarantee the national economy with labor, to guarantee industry with equipment, steel, fuel, and building materials. Here, plans to reduce the cost of production and establish savings, etc., must be taken into account.

　　The plan drawn up according to all production sectors shows whether the speed of development of this sector is appropriate and meets the requirements of the national economy of the country. Planning the connections between the entire Soviet national economy to regulate the needs of individual parts for labor, equipment, and fuel, etc.

　　The tasks of the entire national economic plan are allocated to the various Union Republics. The Soviet national economic plan is configured according to the specific productive forces of each locality.

　　The social reproduction planning nature is the most important characteristic of the socialist economy. A considerable proportion is achieved between the various departments of the national economy by means of settlement methods. Regulating the development of the various sectors of the national economy by formulating appropriate settlements, achieving the correct proportion between savings and consumption and between production development and construction, and guaranteeing all state enterprises and construction projects with labor. Formulating settlements also determines the quantity of national material reserves. Therefore, the settlement method solves the regulation problem of socialist planning. So it also plays a major role in formulating the Soviet national economic plan.

　　Stalin played a great role in formulating the Soviet national economic plan. The talented and far-sighted leader of the Soviet people prescribed the path for the development of the entire Soviet economy and its individual sectors and regions. Kuibyshev, a famous activist of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, said at the Seventeenth Congress of the Federal Communist Party: The plan for building metallurgical plants was predetermined by Stalin. Stalin carefully observed the factories one after another, and pointed out which factories should be built first in the second five-year plan. The plan for building transport machinery manufacturing plants was also prescribed by Stalin. The construction of automobile factories, naval shipbuilding plants, and many other factories, as well as their construction locations and the strength they should have, were all in accordance with Stalin's instructions. The laying out and planning of the main railway lines was also due to Stalin's suggestions.

　　All the important issues in the third Five-Year Economic Plan were also determined by Stalin.

　　Stalin was the instigator of the Soviet five-year plan for the post-war national economic recovery and development.

　　As is well known, the Soviet people are successfully and ahead of schedule implementing this plan.

　　苏联国民经济计划是怎样制定的？
    瓦林特  作
    国民经济计划的主要任务是苏联共产党和苏联政府确定的。比如说：第一个苏联五年计划的有决定意义的环节，是以机械制造业为中心而来发展重工业的任务。在第二和第三个五年经济计划中，重工业的主要部门——冶金工业、机械制造业、燃料工业、动力工业、化学工业是其基本的环节。在战后苏联五年计划中，预定的首要任务是发展燃料开采业、黑色冶金工业、电站和铁路运输业。
    制定计划是一件长期的而艰巨的工作。首先是要总结过去一个时期。而后由国家计划机关发出制定新国民经济计划的指令，而以当时之经济和历史任务为其制定的出发点。换句话说：就是确定新五年计划的主要环节。再次，拟定计划草案，这个草案要由政府批准。此后，才进到有决定意义的时期——组织计划的执行。
    批准的国民经济计划具有法律的效力。斯大林对这事的指示说：苏联的计划并非预测，并非猜想，而是一切必须执行的指令。苏联按科学拟定这个计划，它是苏联所有经济机关、企业及全体人民的工作大纲——这些是计划的创造者。
    苏联国民经济计划的内容包括些什么呢？在国民经济计划中，首先是把每个工业和农业部门之生产品的制作计划调节起来。计划本身包括有生产的技术和经济条件。换句话说：就是包括产物的质量、工艺方法、原料、材料和燃料等消费定额，以及劳动力和成本费的投入数量。国民经济通常包括有广大的建筑大纲。计划也预定社会生产品的分配。一部分生产品拿去抵偿生产时的耗费，另一部分拿去扩大生产和作为国家的后备基金。除此之外，还抽出一部分作管理基金，和为满足社会需要的基金——为教育和保健之用；同时还有为巩固国防的基金。其余的一部分社会生产品，按耗费的劳动数量与质量给予生产者享用。计划也确定商品流通的数量和资金——从此而确定运输机关和商业组织的工作。
    劳动方面的措施在计划中占最重要的地位：按着经济部门分配劳动力、提高劳动生产率、规定工资、提高劳动机械化等等，以及在工艺学校、铁路学校、工厂艺徒学校培养大批熟练工人。最后，在经济计划内包含有财政计划。因此，国民经济计划所包含的款项，是苏联全部国民经济发展的基本指标。
    苏联国民经济计划包括着整个工业的任务、全部机器制造业的任务、全部木材工业的任务等等，这所谓经济计划的部门化。同时也要拟制部门间的计划。在经济计划中包含着保证国民经济以劳动力的纲领，保证工业以装备、钢铁、燃料和建筑材料的纲领。这里要计算到降低生产品的成本费和建立积蓄等等的计划。
    按全部生产部门拟成的计划，表明是否适当于此部门发展的速度，和国家国民经济的要求。策划苏联全部国民经济间的联系，来调节个别部分对劳动力、装备和燃料等等的需求。
    整个国民经济计划的任务分配各联盟共和国内。苏联的国民经济计划，根据各地方具体生产力而配置。
    社会再生产计划性质是社会主义经济最重要特点。在国民经济各部门间，用决算的办法达到相当的比例。以拟制相当的决算来调节国民经济各部门的发展，达到积蓄和消费以及生产发展和建筑中间正确的比重，保证国家所有企业和建筑工程以劳动力。拟制决算也确定国家物质后备数量。因此，决算方法，解决社会主义筹划的调节问题。所以在拟制苏联国民经济计划时，它也起主要的作用。
    斯大林在拟定苏联国民经济计划时起着伟大的作用。富有天才而远视的苏联人民的领袖，规定全部苏联的经济及其个别部门和区域发展的道路。布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家的著名活动家库依贝摄夫在联邦共产党第十七次代表大会上说：建设冶金工厂的计划是斯大林预定的。斯大林仔细的、一个跟一个的观察了工厂，并指出在第二个五年计划中，应当首先建筑的那些工厂。建筑运输机制造厂的计划也是斯大林规定的。汽车工厂、海舰建造厂和其他许多工厂的建筑和其建筑的地址及应有的强力，也都遵照斯大林的指示。铁路主要干线的敷设、计划，也是由于斯大林的建议。
    在第三个五年经济计划的一切重要问题也是斯大林确定的。
    斯大林是苏联战后国民经济复兴和发展之五年计划的鼓励者。
    众所周知的，苏联人民在顺利地和提前地执行这一计划。
