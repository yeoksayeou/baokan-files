Prospects for China's Coal Mining Industry
By our correspondent Shang Kai

Rich Underground Resources

From the surging waves of the Heilongjiang River to the towering Hengduan Mountains, from the vast plains of Shandong to the distant Xinjiang wilderness – beneath the beautiful land of our great motherland lie inexhaustible resources. Coal, known as "black gold" or "black jade," is particularly abundant. Estimated national coal reserves are approximately 200 billion metric tons, of which bituminous coal accounts for about 60 percent. It is dense, black, and lustrous, suitable for industrial and transportation fuel.

North China is the heart of China's coal production. Major mining areas include Kailuan, Jingxing, and Fengfeng in Hebei Province; Mentougou in western Beijing; D青山 (Da Qingshan) in southern Chahar; Datong and Yangquan in Shanxi Province; Tongguan and Hancheng in Shaanxi Province; Liuhegou and Jiaozuo in the plains; and Zichuan, Boshan, Zhangqiu, Xintai, Laiwu, and Zhongxing in Shandong Province. Among these, the Datong coalfield in North China has the largest reserves, estimated at 40 billion metric tons, with flat terrain and regular coal seams. Coalfields in Northeast China are mostly located in southern Manchuria, including Beipiao, Fuxin, Fushun, Tonghua, and Benxi. In northern Manchuria, there are mines such as Hegang and Jixi. South of the Yellow River, notable coal mines include Pingxiang in Jiangxi Province, Huainan in Anhui Province, Tianfu in Sichuan Province, Mingliang in Yunnan Province, and Donglin in Guizhou Province. Although widely distributed, except for Huainan, most of these mines have smaller coal seams and thicknesses, and are not the main focus of coal production. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the total national coal production had reached 32.7 million metric tons per year. When the Japanese invaders occupied major mining areas, they desperately plundered resources, reaching a peak production of 55 million metric tons in 1942.

Plunder by Imperialist Robbers

Coal was discovered and mined in China as early as the mid-Eastern Han Dynasty, but large-scale modern mining only began in the last four or five decades since the late Qing Dynasty. Because China was then a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, the coal industry, like other industries, suffered from the oppression and constraints of imperialist and feudal forces from the very beginning. Initially, the Qing emperors were superstitious and forbade coal mining in Northeast China. Later, when the maritime ban was lifted, imperialist powers such as Britain, Russia, Germany, and Japan successively seized mining rights in China by force, exploiting China's cheap labor to mine Chinese coal seams. Foreign capital gradually penetrated major coal mines through "Sino-foreign joint ventures." For example, in Northeast China, there were the Sino-British joint venture Nanpiao Coal Mine, the Sino-Russian joint venture Muleng Coal Mine, the Sino-Japanese joint ventures Benxi, Niuxintai, Dayagou, and Fuxin mines, as well as the Fushun Yantai Coal Mine, which was first operated by Tsarist Russia and then by Japan. The main mines wholly operated by Chinese capital were only the Zhongxing Mine in Shandong, the Huainan Mine in Anhui, and the Pingxiang Mine in Jiangxi, most of which were owned by warlords and bureaucratic capitalists, with very little commercial capital involved.

When World War I broke out, the imperialist powers had no time to look east, so public or public-private joint venture coal mines and private small kilns emerged in various parts of China, showing temporary prosperity. However, due to limited capital, most still used traditional methods of mining, resulting in high costs and low production. Although they competed with major mines operated by foreign capital, they eventually suffered losses and either closed down or were sold, facilitating the acquisition and annexation by imperialist invading capital. According to statistics, in 1923, Chinese capital still accounted for 46 percent of the national coal mining industry, but by 1928, Chinese capital had fallen to 18 percent.

Heroic Mine Protection Struggles

From the "September 18th Incident" (Mukden Incident) and the occupation of Northeast China, until after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, most of China's abundant coal resources were monopolized by Japanese imperialism. To support their war of aggression and extract super-profits, Japanese zaibatsu and warlords carried out extremely barbaric plundering, driving as many as 600,000 Chinese coal miners to mine for them. In mining engineering, the Japanese invaders naturally did not plan for the long term. For example, they did not support pit props in the pits, and even damaged coal pillars and tunnels. This exhaustive mining method made the mine projects chaotic and severely damaged their vitality. From 1931 to 1945, over fourteen years, Japanese imperialism plundered more than 390 million metric tons of coal from China.

During the dark years of Japanese imperialist rule, more than 600,000 coal miners and countless laborers who were temporarily conscripted suffered all kinds of torture, and the mortality rate increased alarmingly. At that time, in the Zhangzhuang Mine in Zichuan alone, an average of more than thirty people died every day. The Japanese invaders regarded human life as worthless and never paid attention to the safety equipment of the mines, so water and fire disasters often occurred. In the explosion at the Dashan pit in Fushun, Northeast China, 900 miners died. In the explosion at the central inclined pit of the Benxi Coal Mine, 1,600 miners were buried in the fire. In a water inundation incident in the Zichuan Mine in Shandong, more than 500 miners lost their lives.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the deeply suffering miners waged a heroic struggle against the Japanese invaders. When the bloodstained hands of the Japanese invaders reached Jingxing, the heroic Jingxing miners launched armed uprisings in succession, organized four anti-Japanese guerrilla teams of miners, echoed by the Yangquan miner guerrilla team, and persisted in the guerrilla war north and south of the Zhengtai Railway. On the eve of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Lu'an Shigjie miners also launched an armed uprising, cooperating with the troops to eliminate the enemies stationed in the mine. There are countless examples of this kind.

The nature of imperialism is plunder and destruction. On the eve of their final defeat, the Japanese robbers carried out barbaric destruction of the coal mines they occupied. In Hengshan Didao and other places in Northeast China, the Japanese invaders organized demolition teams to destroy mine machinery with explosives, set fire to houses, and flood the mines, causing uncountable losses.

Arduous Restoration Project

China's coal mining industry suffered great losses due to the destruction by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit troops. Major mining areas such as Fushun, Fuxin, Jixi, and Jiaohe in Northeast China, Zibo, Zaozhuang, and Xinwen in Shandong, and Datong in North China were dilapidated when we finally liberated them, making restoration work extremely difficult. But the Communists are good at overcoming difficulties, and the only magic weapon is to mobilize the workers, rely on the workers, ask everyone for ideas, and think of solutions collectively. The workers wiped away their tears, suppressed the fire of anger, and, in addition to celebrating the liberation, immediately undertook the arduous task of rebuilding the people's own mines.

The focus of the restoration work was to drain the accumulated water and renovate the tunnels. The first difficulty encountered in this project was the dilapidation and lack of mechanical and electrical equipment. Therefore, all employees voluntarily contributed equipment, pieced together old parts, and created substitutes. Where there was no electricity, steam power was used. Where there was no steam power, manpower was used. Without engineers, everyone discussed together in meetings. In this way, they fought day and night against the difficulties. When repairing the Hongshan Coal Mine power plant in Shandong, there were neither engineers nor materials. Veteran workers Tang Yude and Li Defu relied on their own experience to try to make substitutes. They did not leave the machine for eight months and finally repaired four motors and seven frozen and cracked boilers. In the winter restoration work at the Jixi Coal Mine in Northeast China, ironworker Zhang Fuwang often worked from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM. His hands were frostbitten, and blood flowed from the cracks, but he still worked with a hammer. In Datong, Fushun, Xinwen, and in the restoration process of every coal mine, countless heroic stories can be heard. According to statistics from coal mines across the country, under the policy of restoring and producing simultaneously in the past two or three years, output has increased significantly. National coal production has rapidly increased from 18 million metric tons in 1946 to 24.5 million metric tons in 1948. It is expected that the production task of 28.858 million metric tons will be completed by the end of this year. Not only has it supplied the needs of military, civilian, industrial, and transportation, and supported the People's Liberation War, but it has also laid the foundation for large-scale production in the future.

Bright Prospects

The coal mining industry of the new China has gradually recovered on the basis of dilapidation. The restoration plan and production tasks for 1949 are about to be completed victoriously. This is the result of the hard work of all miners and production engineering and technical personnel who have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm. At present, the national economy is still in a period of recovery, and the consumption of coal by industry and railways is still low. Therefore, in the next year or two, the coal mining industry should focus on construction in the Northeast according to regional conditions, while the Guannei (area south of Shanhaiguan) should focus on restoration. Based on the existing foundation, old wellheads, tunnels, and mechanical and electrical equipment should be repaired, while a batch of old wells will be abandoned due to the exhaustion of coal reserves. In general mining areas, deep mining equipment should be constructed, and new wellheads should be opened in a planned way. Under the principle of "safety first," coal mining technology should be improved, production efficiency should be increased, and efforts should be made to completely heal the wounds inflicted on China's coal mining industry by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit troops within three years.

In order to meet the great construction period and supply a large amount of industrial coal, it is impossible to guarantee relying solely on the current general coal mining methods and means. Therefore, striving for the full mechanization of coal mining should not be a distant goal. This requires that all our current engineering equipment repairs and facilities should pay attention to standardization and long-termization to prepare for the realization of fully mechanized coal mining. At the same time, starting to train and cultivate a large number of engineers and workers who use new machinery is an important guarantee for the realization of coal mining mechanization. The National Coal Mine Conference passed a plan to train technical cadres, including mining engineering, geological exploration, mining machinery, mining construction, coal preparation and coking, and mining management. They will study theory and practice in the mines. The Northeast, North China, and East China Coal Mine Administrations and major mines should establish vocational schools at all levels to train a large number of middle and lower-level technical cadres to meet the needs of each mine.

　　我国煤矿工业的展望
    本报记者  商恺
    丰富的地下宝藏
    从波浪滚滚的黑龙江，到峰峦起伏的横断山脉，从辽阔的齐鲁平原，到遥远的新疆原野——在我们伟大祖国的锦绣河山之下，蕴藏着无穷尽的富源。被人喻为乌金墨玉的煤炭，蕴藏量尤丰。估计全国煤炭埋藏量，约为二千多亿公吨，其中沥青煤约占百分之六十，质地细密，色黑而有光泽，可供工业和交通燃料之用。
    华北为我国煤产的重心。主要矿田如河北之开滦、井陉、峰峰，京西之门头沟，察南之大青山，山西之大同、阳泉，陕西之同官、韩城，平原之六河沟、焦作，山东之淄川、博山、章邱、新泰、莱芜及中兴等煤矿，都很著名。华北境内以大同煤田藏量最丰，估计为四百亿公吨，而且地形平坦煤层整齐。东北的煤田多在南满一带，主要者如北票、阜新、抚顺、通化、本溪；北满有鹤岗、鸡西等矿。黄河以南著名的煤矿有江西之萍乡，安徽之淮南，四川之天府，云南之明良，贵州之东林等，分布区域虽广，唯除淮南以外，大都煤层较少，厚度不大，不是产煤的重心。　在抗日战争以前，全国每年煤炭总产量已达三千二百七十万公吨。日寇侵占各重要矿区时，曾经拼命掠夺，一九四二年达到五千五百万公吨最高产量。
    帝国主义强盗的掠夺
    远在后汉中叶，我国即已发现和采掘煤炭，但大规模的现代化的开采，还是清末以来四五十年间的事。由于当时我国还是半封建半殖民地的社会，煤炭工业也和其他工业一样，一开始即遭受着帝国主义封建势力的压迫和束缚。起初满清皇帝迷信风水，禁止在东北采煤；后来海禁大开，英俄德日等帝国主义先后以暴力攫得了在中国的采矿权，利用中国的廉价劳动力，采掘中国的煤层。从此外国资本即通过“中外合办”的方式逐渐侵入了各主要煤矿。例如：在东北有中英合办的南票煤矿，中俄合办的穆棱煤矿，中日合办的本溪、牛心台、大窑沟、阜新等矿，还有先由帝俄后由日本经营的抚顺烟台煤矿；在华北有中英合办的开滦、焦作、门头沟煤矿；在山东有先德国独营后中日合办的淄博各矿。完全由中国资本经营的主要矿山，仅有山东之中兴矿，安徽之淮南矿，江西之萍乡矿等，其中又多军阀官僚资本，商民资本为数甚微。
    第一次世界大战爆发，帝国主义无暇东顾，于是我国各地公营或公私合营之煤矿，以及民间小窑纷纷出现，表现了暂时的繁盛；但因限于资力，仍多用土法开采，成本高产量低，虽与外资经营的各大矿竞争，最后因赔累不堪，或停办或转售，便利了帝国主义侵略资本的收买和吞并。据统计，一九二三年全国煤矿工业中，中国资本尚占百分之四十六，但到一九二八年，中国资本就降至百分之十八了。
    英勇的护矿斗争
    从“九一八”东北沦陷起，直到一九三七年抗日战争爆发以后，我国丰富的煤炭资源，绝大部分被日本帝国主义独占。日本财阀军阀为支持其侵略战争，为剥削超额利润，进行了极端野蛮的掠夺，驱使我国煤炭工人为其开采的即达六十万人之多。在采掘工程上，日寇当然不作长期打算，例如在坑内不支撑坑木，甚至挖坏煤柱和坑道，这种竭泽而渔的开采方法，使各矿井工程零乱，元气大伤。从一九三一年至一九四五年的十四个年头内，日本帝国主义掠夺我国煤炭达三亿九千余万公吨。
    在日本帝国主义统治的黑暗岁月里，六十余万煤矿工人，和临时抓去的无数劳工，受尽了各种苦痛的折磨，死亡率惊人的增高，当时仅淄川张庄矿，平均每天要死三十个人以上。日寇视人命如草芥，对矿井的安全设备从不注意，水火灾变经常发生。东北抚顺大山坑爆炸事件，死了九百矿工，本溪煤矿中央大斜坑爆炸，一千六百矿工葬身火窟，山东淄川矿一次水淹事件，五百余名矿工丧失生命。
    苦难深重的矿工们，在共产党领导下，对日寇进行了英勇的斗争。当日寇的血手伸到了井陉时，英勇的井陉矿工，曾连续举行了武装起义，先后组织四支矿工抗日游击队，和阳泉矿工游击队遥相呼应，坚持着正太路南北的游击战争。在抗日战争胜利的前夕，潞安石圪节矿工，也举行了武装起义，配合部队消灭了驻矿的敌人。这种可歌可泣的例子是不胜枚举的。
    帝国主义的本性是掠夺和破坏。日本强盗在其最后失败的前夕，曾对占领下的煤矿进行了野蛮的破坏。在东北的恒山滴道等地，日寇都组织了破坏队，用炸药炸毁矿山机械，并纵火烧房，放水淹井，造成了无法统计的损失。
    艰巨的恢复工程
    我国煤矿工业经过日本帝国主义和国民党匪军的破坏，损失是很大的，各主要矿区如东北之抚顺、阜新、鸡西、蛟河，山东之淄博、枣庄、新汶，华北的大同等地，到我最后解放时，已经残破不堪，恢复工作极为困难。但共产党人是善于克服困难的，唯一的法宝便是发动工人，依靠工人，大家出主意，集体想办法。工人们擦干了眼泪，抑止住愤怒之火，于欢庆解放之余，立即担负起重建人民自己矿山的艰巨任务。
    恢复工作的中心是排除积水整理坑道。在此工程中，首先遇到的困难是机电设备的残破和缺乏。于是全体员工自动献交器材，拼凑旧机件，创造代用品，没有电力的地方利用汽力，没汽力的地方利用人力，没有工程师便由大家开会商量；就这样日以继夜的和困难搏斗。修复山东洪山煤矿发电厂时，既没有工程师，又缺乏器材，老工人唐玉德和李德福凭着自己的经验，试制代用品，八个月未离机器一步，终于修好了四部电机和七部冻裂了的锅炉。东北鸡西煤矿铁工张福旺、在去年冬季的修复工作中，经常从上午七时工作到下午八时，手冻裂了，血从裂缝里流出来，仍然拿着锤子工作。在大同，在抚顺，在新汶，在各个煤矿的恢复过程中，都可以听到无数的英雄故事。根据全国各矿的统计，两三年来在一面恢复一面生产的方针下，产量已有显著的增高。全国煤产量，已由一九四六年的一千八百万公吨，迅速增至一九四八年的二千四、五百万公吨，预计今年年底便可完成二千八百八十五万八千公吨的生产任务。不但供应了军需民用和工业交通的需要，支援了人民解放战争，并且为将来大规模的生产打下了基础。
    光明的前景
    新中国的煤矿工业已在残破的基础上逐渐的恢复起来，一九四九年的恢复计划和生产任务，眼看要胜利的完成了。这是全体矿工和生产工程技术人员发挥高度劳动热情，艰辛努力的结果。目前国民经济尚在恢复时期，工业和铁路用煤尚少。因此煤矿工业在今后一二年内，根据地区情况应以东北为建设重点，而关里则以恢复为主，从现有基础上，修复旧有井口、坑道和机电设备，而一批旧井将因藏煤采尽而被废弃。在一般矿区，应该建设深部采煤设备，和有计划的开新井口。在“安全第一”的原则下，改善采煤技术，提高生产效率，争取在三年内完全医好日本帝国主义和国民党匪军所给予我国煤矿工业的创伤。
    为了迎接伟大的建设时期，供应大量的工业用煤，如果只靠目前一般的采煤方法和手段，是无法保证的；因此争取采煤的全面机械化，不应是很远的奋斗目标。这就要求我们今天的一切工程设备修复和设施，都要注意到标准化，长期化，为实现全面机械采煤做好准备。同时开始训练培养大批使用新式机械之工程师和工人，更是实现采煤机械化的重要保证。全国煤矿会议上通过了培养技术干部的计划，培养采矿工程、地质探勘、矿山机械、矿山建筑、选煤炼焦、矿山管理等技术干部，一面学习理论，一面到矿山实习。东北华北华东各煤矿管理局各及大矿应该设立各级专科职业学校，大批培养中下级技术干部，以应各矿之需要。
