　　Beijing News: The Jingxi Mining Bureau, in accordance with the Beijing Municipal People's Government's policy of managing and supporting private coal mines in the Mentougou mining area, has agreed with the Jingxi Coal Mining Company to acquire the houses and equipment of various private small coal kilns within the public mining area that have been sealed off or shut down due to the rainy season, to assist them in changing industries, and to promptly and appropriately resolve the employment issues of the workers in these private small coal kilns. As of now, the Mentougou mine of the Jingxi Coal Mining Company has acquired the houses and equipment of fifteen private kilns, including Yongxing and Baofeng; the Chengzi mine has acquired fifteen small kilns, including Huazhong and Hexing, and is still continuing to acquire more. The Mining Bureau has supported private small kilns to operate coal mining in the western private mining area of the mining district, including: the original Tongqing Kiln (now operating as Fuxing Heji), Hexing Kiln (now operating as Xiqing Shengji), Tianfu Kiln (now operating as Demaoji), and Sanhe Kiln (now operating as Zengxing Kiln). Multiple loans were granted during the transition.

　　Regarding the employment issue of small kiln workers, the Jingxi Mining Bureau, together with the Beijing Municipal Coal Mine Workers' Union, the district government, and other relevant authorities, promptly addressed the employment issue of workers after the kilns were flooded during this year's rainy season. In May, 261 workers were introduced to work in public Chengzi mine, Mentougou mine, and Wenxing Binji kiln and other small kilns. In July, a staff employment agency was established, introducing more than 480 small kiln workers to work in the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine, and mobilizing some workers to return home for summer farming. In August, in addition to introducing 113 people to the public Chengzi mine, 575 people had already started working in small kilns such as Junmin, Shengli, and Wuhua. Currently, there are 117 coal-producing private mines in the private mining area, accommodating 12,289 workers. More than 50 others will gradually produce coal, with an estimated minimum need of more than 2,000 workers. At present, the work issues of all small kiln workers have been rationally resolved.

　　京西矿务处收购私营小煤窑
    合理解决工人就业问题
    【北京讯】京西矿务处根据京市人民政府对门头沟矿区私营矿窑的管理与扶植方针，已与京西煤矿公司议定，收购公营矿区内被查封的、雨季停工的各私营小窑房屋、器材，协助其转业，并及时适当地解决了各私营小窑工人就业问题。截至目前为止，京西煤矿公司门头沟矿厂已收购了永兴、宝丰等私营窑十五家的房屋器材；城子矿厂收购了华中、合兴等十五家小窑，刻仍陆续收购中。矿务处扶植私营小窑到矿区西部私营矿区内经营采煤者有：原同庆窑（今开办复兴合记），和兴窑（今开办为西庆生记），天福窑（今开办为德茂记），三合窑（今开办为增兴窑）等。在转业中并予以多次贷款。
    关于小窑工人就业问题，早在今年雨季淹窑后京西矿务处即与北京市煤矿工会、区政府等有关机关及时处理了工人就业问题。五月份介绍工人二百六十一人到公营城子矿厂、门头沟矿厂和文兴斌记窑等小窑就业。七月份成立了职工职业介绍所，介绍小窑工人四百八十余人到宣化龙烟铁矿就业，并动员一部工人回家夏耕。八月份除介绍到公营城子矿一百十三人外，有五百七十五人已到军民、胜利、五华等小窑工作。现在私营矿区内产煤者一百十七家，容纳工人一万二千二百八十九人。尚有五十余家陆续产煤，估计最低需工人二千余名。目前各小窑工人均已合理地解决了工作问题。
