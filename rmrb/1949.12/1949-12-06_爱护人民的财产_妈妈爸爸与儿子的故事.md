　　Cherishing the People's Property
  　A Story of Mom, Dad, and Son
    Heng
    Since the child was sent to school at the age of seven, it had been more than two years since they had seen each other, due to his mom and dad's job transfers. This summer, Mom and Dad were transferred to work in Beijing, and the child's school also moved to Beijing. Mom and Dad brought the child back to spend the summer vacation. Naturally, they felt very close after not seeing each other for two years. But it also immediately gave Mom a lot of extra work, like sewing clothes for the child and tutoring the child!
    One day, Mom discovered that the child's pockets were full of broken copper, scrap iron, and old nails. Two large nails had poked two big holes in the right pocket that Mom had just mended the day before. Mom looked at the child's pair of broken shoes under the bed, which she had been mending for two afternoons without finishing. At the same time, because of meetings, the clothes she had changed out of two days ago were still piled on the chair at the head of the bed, unwashed. She also looked at the pile of broken copper, scrap iron, and some electric wires that the child had picked up these past few days, making the room a mess. She couldn't help but get anxious and said:
    "Daping! You're so old now, but you don't understand anything. You're always messing around in those dirty garbage piles. What good do you think you're doing with these scraps! I wash for you and mend for you every day! It's killing me, Mom! Sigh! You might as well go back to school sooner."
    The child, with tears in his eyes, stared at Mom with wide eyes, looking at her with a fearful expression. He also stole glances at the big pile of broken copper and scrap iron in the corner, stuttering:
    "That's what I picked up with Zhang Tong and Li Siwa."
    Mom didn't wait for the child to finish speaking, and became anxious again, saying:
    "Yes, I saw you rummaging through the garbage heap the day before yesterday. You're not allowed to do that anymore. If you're eating the people's millet, you have to sit properly in the classroom and study hard, learn skills so you can serve the people in the future. If you do this again, I'll write a letter to your teacher."
    The child raised his head, pursed his little lips, widened his small eyes, and looked at Mom, saying:
    "The teacher told us to pick them up."
    Mom said very strangely:
    "The teacher isn't telling you to come back and review your lessons properly, is he telling you to come back and rummage through dirty scraps?"
    The child said:
    "Our teacher told us that broken copper and scrap iron are all the people's public property, and good children should pick them up when they see them and hand them over to the teacher. The teacher will give them to the public in the future, so they can be made into useful things."
    At this moment, Mom's heart was somewhat moved. She felt that the child had a reason for picking up dirty things, and she shouldn't have treated the child that way, so her attitude softened and she said:
    "Okay! Tell Mom in detail how your teacher told you to cherish the people's property!"
    The child said:
    "When our school moved here, there were so many things in the yard and the house! There are glass bottles, ink bottles, tin cans, nails, screws, iron bars, iron buckles on doors and windows, electric wires, bowls, chopsticks, broken clothes, broken shoes... There are so many things! Zhang Tong threw glass bottles around to play with, seeing which one would break first. Liu Yucheng used the big floral teapot as a potty. Later, Teacher Li found out and said to us, "These things are all exchanged for with the people's blood and sweat. In the past, the Kuomintang bandit army was stationed here, and they specialized in ruining the people's property. The windows and doors in this courtyard were broken by them, and the big trees in the front yard were cut down by them. All the scrap here was thrown away by them." The teacher also said: We are the children of the people, and we must cherish the people's public property. Young Pioneers should play an exemplary role, collect all the scrap, and hand it over to the teacher.”
    The child said happily at this point: "Mom! I'm a member of the Young Pioneers, and I picked up the most. The teacher also said that I am a model student in cherishing the people's property."
    Mom felt uneasy in her heart, and said in a very gentle voice: "Daping! Did the teacher ask you to do this when you came home?" The child heard that Mom's voice was gentle, and happily said: "No, the teacher only said that we should pick up broken things when we see them. After the three of us came back, we saw that there were many things in your yard, so we agreed to pick them up and hand them over to the teacher when we returned to school in the future."
    As Mom listened to the child, she thought about the documents they had studied on cherishing the property of the people of the motherland. They had held two meetings, and everyone had made self-criticisms. Everyone only paid attention to saving electricity and tap water, but no one ever thought about picking up these scraps. During the general cleaning, they even buried a lot of broken copper and scrap iron in the pits. Thinking of this, Mom was very ashamed. Just then, Dad came back in a hurry from outside. Mom looked very sad and told him what had happened between her and the child. Finally, she sighed and said:
    "In these places, we still only look at our personal interests. We brought a bundle of scrap cloth and a pair of broken shoes from school to here. But we didn't pay attention to the many valuable things in the whole yard. For example, the big bed board outside our door is exposed to the sun and rain day and night, and it's about to fall apart, but we never thought of moving it inside. Alas! We are really not as good as the child."
    The child looked at his mom and dad's repentant faces and said earnestly: "Our teacher said that it doesn't matter if you make mistakes, as long as you work hard to correct them."
    Dad looked at his son and ran to the yard to move the dilapidated bed board into the house.

　　爱护人民的财产
  　妈妈爸爸与儿子的故事
    恒
    自从孩子在七周岁的时候被送到学校以后，因为爸爸妈妈的工作调动，已有两年多没有见面了。今年夏天，爸爸妈妈调到北京来工作，孩子所在的学校也迁到北京，爸爸妈妈便把孩子接回来过暑假了。两年没见面，自然觉着十分的亲热。但也立刻又给与了妈妈许多额外的工作，为孩子缝补衣服呀！为孩子补习功课呀！
    一天，妈妈发现孩子的口袋里，装满了许多的破铜烂铁旧钉子，有两个大钉子，把妈妈前天刚补好了的右边的口袋戳了两个大洞。妈妈看床下面的孩子的一双破鞋，补了两个下午还没有补成；同时，因为开会，换下来的衣服两天了，还堆在床头的椅子上没洗；又看了看房角下堆着的孩子这几天拾来的破铜烂铁和一些电线，把房间弄的乱七八糟的，不由的急了起来说道：
    “大平！你这样大了，简直什么也不懂的。整天在那些脏垃圾堆里搞，你看你弄这些破烂东西有什么用！我每天给你洗呀，补呀！把妈妈都要累死了，唉！这样你还不如早点上学去的好。”
    孩子含着眼泪，瞪着两只圆圆的眼睛，带着惧怕的神色望着妈妈，又偷偷的斜着眼看看房角下的那一大堆的破铜烂铁，吞吞吐吐地说：
    “那是我和张同、李四娃一块儿拾的。”
    妈妈没有等孩子说完，又急了起来说：
    “是的，我前天就看见你们在垃圾堆里扒烂东西了。以后再不许这样的，吃人民的小米，就得好好的坐在课堂里念书，好好学本领将来好给人民服务，再这样我可要写信告诉你的老师了。”
    孩子仰起头来，撅起了小嘴巴，鼓起了一双小眼睛，望着妈妈说：
    “是老师叫我们几个人拾的。”
    妈妈很奇怪的说：
    “老师不叫你们回来好好温习功课，叫你们回来扒烂脏东西的吗？”
    孩子说：
    “俺老师给俺们说，破铜烂铁都是人民公共的财产，好儿童应该见到就拾起来，交给老师，老师将来交给公家，可以制成有用的东西。”
    这时妈妈的心有一些动了，感到孩子拾脏东西是有理由的，不应该那样态度对孩子，态度就温和起来说：
    “好吧！你把你们老师怎样叫你们爱护人民的财产事，给妈妈详细的说一说吧！”
    孩子说：
    “我们学校搬到这里，院里屋里的东西多呢！有玻璃瓶、墨水瓶、洋铁罐子、钉子、螺丝、铁条、门窗上的铁扣子、电线、碗、筷子、破衣服、破鞋……，东西可多呢！张同把玻璃瓶摔着玩，看看那一个先坏。刘玉成把大花茶壶当了尿罐子。后来李老师知道了就对我们说：“这些东西都是人民的血汗换来的。以前这里驻的是国民党匪军，他们专门糟塌人民的财产，这院里的窗门是他们劈烂的，前院里那些大树是他们砍的，这里的破烂东西都是他们丢的。”老师又说：我们是人民的子弟，要爱护人民公共的财产，少年儿童队员，更应该起模范作用，把破烂东西都收集起来，交给老师。”
    孩子说到这里高兴的说：“妈妈！我是少年儿童队的队员，我拾的最多，老师还说我是爱护人民财产的模范学生呢。”
    妈妈心里感到不安了，声音非常温柔的说：“大平！老师叫你们回家来也这样做的吗？”孩子听见妈妈的声音温柔了，高兴的说：“没有，老师只说看见了破东西应当拾起来。我们三个人回来后，看到您们院里东西很多，我们就约定拾起来，将来回到学校交给老师。”
    妈妈一边听着孩子说，一边想起来他们学习爱护祖国人民财产的文件时，曾开了两次会，会上各个人都做了检讨，大家只注意到电灯和自来水的节约，却从没有人想到拾这些烂东西。大扫除的时候，还把很多的破铜烂铁都埋到坑里了。妈妈想到这里，很是惭愧。正好爸爸忙呼呼地从外边回来了。妈妈很难过的样子，把她同孩子的事说了一遍，最后叹了一口气说道：
    “这些地方，我们还是只看着个人的利益，一包碎布头，一双破鞋，我们从学校带到这里来。但是满院许多宝贵的东西，我们都没有放在眼里，例如我们门外的那付大床板，日晒夜露风吹雨打，都快散开了，我们都不曾想到去搬进来。唉！我们真不如孩子。”
    孩子望着爸爸妈妈忏悔的脸，认真的神气说：“我们的老师说了，错了没有关系，只要努力改正就行。”
    爸爸看了看儿子，跑到院里把那快散开的一付床板搬到屋里来了。
