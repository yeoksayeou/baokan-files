　　Stalin's Radiance Illuminates Red Square
　　First Impressions of a Visit to the Soviet Union
　　Shakoff
　　(November 7th)
　　This is the anniversary of the victory of the Soviet socialist October Revolution, a great day of historical significance. Every year on this day, the entire Soviet Union and even the people of the world joyfully hold celebrations, because the victory of the Soviet people is also the victory of the people of all countries. The victory of the Soviet October Revolution opened a new era of victory in the history of world revolution.
　　At eight o'clock in the morning, we gathered and set off, each comrade filled with joy and excitement, heading towards Red Square. From our ranks came bursts of hearty laughter, as we chatted with each other while walking. Someone loudly said, "Today we will definitely see Comrade Stalin in Red Square!" This sentence naturally aroused the fervent hope of every comrade, and a satisfied smile appeared on their faces.
　　Winter had already begun in Moscow, but it had not snowed, and the weather was not too cold; especially on this day, there was neither a piercing north wind nor a warm and lovely sunshine. This made the Soviet people's capital a hundred times more vibrant and lively.
　　When we entered the venue, Red Square had already become a sea of people.
　　Red Square was so solemn and beautiful, especially as it was dressed in its most beautiful clothes for the holiday, making it appear even more radiant and full of vitality.
　　First, the review of the armed forces began. Infantry, artillery, cavalry, and marines marched past in heroic columns; the speed of the aerial flying formations – we only heard the sound of the aircraft engines when they were overhead – made everyone feel invigorated and constantly look up.
　　From this review, we saw the Soviet Red Army commanders and fighters' strong fighting will, heroic spirit, energetic spirit, and their well-equipped and sophisticated weapons – the strength of the Soviet national defense. This also explains why the heroic Soviet Red Army was able to completely crush the most vicious enemy – the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist bandits – during World War II; at the same time, it makes us firmly believe that if the American and British imperialists dare to provoke a new war, they will inevitably meet the same fate as the fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan; the world peace and democracy forces led by the Soviet Union are sufficient to defeat any war provocateurs.
　　"The Soviet Union truly deserves to be the most powerful bulwark of world peace and democracy!" - Such words of admiration were constantly passed among our comrades.
　　Then the marching crowds poured in. Thousands upon thousands of red flags of all colors, portraits of leaders, slogans, etc., fluttered over people's heads, and slogans broadcast from loudspeakers resounded throughout the square. We often heard slogans such as "Long live the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War!" "Salute to the heroic and great Chinese people!" We saw several times portraits of Chairman Mao, Liu Shaoqi, and Comrade Zhou Enlai being held high in the marching队伍. When our Chinese delegation stood on the reviewing stand, we were constantly watched with respect, and we deeply felt unparalleled glory. This glory belongs to the Chinese people and also to Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people. This is the same reason why the Soviet people often cheer "Glory to Comrade Stalin!"
　　Yes, at any gathering, when the Soviet people hear the slogans "Long live Comrade Stalin!" or "Glory to Comrade Stalin!" the whole audience shouts "Hurrah!" and the applause is like thunder, lasting for a long time. This is enough to show the high enthusiasm of the Soviet masses in supporting and loving their great leader. This also fully demonstrates the spirit of unity of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. - This is one of the most important factors in the unparalleled strength of the Soviet socialist state.
　　The marching crowds flowed by continuously. The slogan "Long live Comrade Stalin!" seemed to resound particularly loudly in Red Square. And Red Square seemed to become even redder and brighter!
　　Someone in our ranks said loudly: Look! Stalin's radiance illuminates Red Square! The people around him heard his voice, and everyone showed smiles on their faces, looking at the radiant Red Square, looking at the brilliant and enthusiastic marching crowds, and saying in their hearts:
　　"Stalin's radiance illuminates Red Square!
　　Stalin's radiance illuminates Moscow!
　　Stalin's radiance illuminates the entire Soviet Union!
　　Stalin's radiance illuminates the whole world!"

　　斯大林的光辉照耀着红场
  　访苏杂记之一
    沙可夫
    （十一月七日）
    这是苏联社会主义十月革命胜利的纪念日，这是个有历史意义的伟大的日子，每年在这一天全苏联以至全世界的人民都欢欣鼓舞地举行庆祝大会，因为苏联人民的胜利也就是世界各国人民的胜利；由于苏联十月革命的胜利在世界革命历史上开辟了一个新的胜利的时代。
    早晨八点钟，我们就集合出发，每个同志充满着愉快兴奋的心情，向着红场前进。从我们队伍里不时发出爽朗的笑声，一边走一边互相交谈。不知谁高声说了这样的话：“今天我们在红场上总会看到斯大林同志了！”这句话自然地引起了每个同志热切的希望，并在脸上露出了满意的微笑。
    莫斯科的冬季已经开始，可是未曾下雪，气候并不太冷；特别是在这一天，既无寒凛刺骨的北风，却有温暖可爱的阳光。这使得这个苏维埃人民的首都更加生气百倍，活跃沸腾起来了。
    当我们进入会场时，红场已变成了人海。
    红场是那么庄严那么美丽，尤其是它为了过节日穿戴了最漂亮的服装，更显得红光焕发，充满着生命力了。
    首先，武装部队的检阅开始了。步、炮、骑与海军陆战队一队又一队英武地慢慢地开过去；空中飞行队伍的速度——飞到头顶上，人们才听到飞机马达的响声——使每个人感到振奋而不断仰首高瞩。
    我们从这检阅中看到了苏联红军指战员的坚强的战斗意志，英雄气概，精力充沛，以及他们的装备整齐，武器精锐——苏联国防力量的强大。这里也就说明了：为什么苏联英勇的红军能在二次世界大战时彻底粉碎了最凶恶的敌人——德、意、日法西斯匪帮；同时使我们坚决相信：如果美英帝国主义者敢于挑起新的战争，他们必将和法西斯德、意、日遭到同样覆灭的命运；以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量足以战胜任何战争挑拨者。
    “苏联真不愧为世界和平民主的最强大的堡垒！”——这样赞叹的话时时从我们同志中间传出来。
    接着群众游行的队伍涌过来了。千千万万的各色各样的红旗、领袖像、标语等等在人头上飘扬，从扩音机中传播出来的口号声响澈全场，我们不时听到：“中国人民解放战争胜利万岁！”“向英勇奋斗的伟大的中国人民致敬！”等等口号。我们几次看到游行队伍中高举着毛主席、刘少奇与周恩来同志的画像。我们中国代表团站在观礼台上时时受到人们敬意的注目，我们深深感到无上的光荣。这光荣是属于中国人民的，也是属于中国人民领袖毛主席的。这正象苏维埃人民常常欢呼“光荣属于斯大林同志！”是一样的道理。
    是的，在任何集会上苏联人民一听到“斯大林同志万岁！”或“光荣属于斯大林同志！”这样的口号时，就全场高呼“乌拉！”掌声如雷，历久不息。这足见苏联群众对自己的伟大领袖拥护爱戴的高度的热情。这里也就充分表现了苏联全国各族人民团结一致的精神。——这是苏维埃社会主义国家力量强大无比的最主要因素之一。
    群众游行的队伍不断地流过去。“斯大林同志万岁！”的口号似乎特别震响在红场上。而红场也就似乎变得更红更亮了！
    我们队伍中间有人高声地说：看呀！斯大林的光辉照耀着红场！周围的人都听到了他的声音，大家脸显笑容，眼望着光辉灿烂的红场，望着光辉热烈的游行的群众，心里且都在说：
    “斯大林的光辉照耀着红场！
    斯大林的光辉照耀着莫斯科！
    斯大林的光辉照耀着全苏联！
    斯大林的光辉照耀着全世界！”
