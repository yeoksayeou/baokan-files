　　China University of Political Science and Law
  　Commemorates "December 9th"
    [Our Newspaper] The General Branch of the New Democratic Youth League of China at the China University of Political Science and Law held a memorial evening for "December 1st" and "December 9th" at 6:00 PM on the 8th of this month. All faculty, staff, and students of the university attended. First, Xu Ping, the General Secretary of the General Branch, briefly reported on the significance of the commemoration. Then, He Li, member of the Central Committee of the Youth League and Minister of Students, briefly described the four historical stages of the Chinese student movement over the past thirty years, explaining that the task of the Chinese student movement in the current new stage is to build our own independent and democratic country. Finally, He Tong put forward two hopes and requirements to the students of the university: (1) The China University of Political Science and Law is the people's university of law. It is hoped that everyone will study Marxism-Leninism well, deeply understand the essence of the state and law, and criticize the old, reactionary views of the state and law; (2) It is hoped that everyone will study the documents and policies of the Chinese Communist Party to create the people's law. Then, the famous Soviet film "Steel Will" was shown.

  　纪念“一二、九”
    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团政法大学总支部于本月八日晚六时举行“一二一”、“一二九”纪念晚会，该校全体教职学工均出席参加，首由总支书徐平简略报告纪念意义后，继由团中央委员兼学生部长何礼简述三十年来中国学生运动的四个历史阶段，说明中国学生运动在现在新阶段的任务是建设我们自己的独立、民主国家。最后何同又对该校同学提出两点希望和要求：（一）政法大学是人民的法科大学，望大家好好研究马列主义，深刻了解国家与法律的本质，去批判旧的反动的国家观法律观；（二）望大家好好学习中共文件、政策以创造人民的法律。接着放映苏联名片“钢铁意志”。
