【Beijing News】Students from major universities and middle schools in the capital warmly commemorate the 14th anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement. The evening party commemorating "December 9th" and "December 1st" held by the Beijing Municipal Working Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Beijing Municipal Student Union took place yesterday (8th) at 8:00 PM in the auditorium of Fu Jen Catholic University. Over 800 student and teacher representatives from major universities and middle schools attended. Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as international friends attending the Asian Women's Representative Conference, including Czech representative Koetinovska Spoma, Korean representative Kim Kui-sun, Indian representative Amitadawe, and Vietnamese representative Ho Duc Minh, were also present. After Gu Qizong, Chairman of the Municipal Student Union, announced the opening of the meeting, everyone stood at attention and sang the national anthem—a song that inspired the people of the whole country during the "December 9th" Movement fourteen years ago. Xu Liqun, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered an opening speech, explaining the significance of commemorating "December 9th" and "December 1st," and pointed out that Beijing students should continue to work hard in implementing the new democratic education policy, and currently, it is necessary to strengthen the study of revolutionary political thought. Comrade Peng Zhen called on the students in his speech to learn from Chairman Mao and be good students of Chairman Mao. The four international friends also delivered speeches, paying tribute to the Chinese people and Chinese youth. Czech representative Koetinovska Spoma presented books she brought from the Czech Republic to Beijing students as a souvenir. After the speeches by the international friends, the Soviet film "Lenin in October" was shown.

Summary of Comrade Peng Zhen's Speech

【Beijing News】Summary of Comrade Peng Zhen's speech at the Beijing Municipal Commemoration of the "December 9th" and "December 1st" Evening Party.

Comrade Peng Zhen said: "December 9th" is worthy of commemoration by the Chinese people. The "December 9th" Movement wrote a glorious page in Chinese history. It is of great significance that we commemorate the "December 9th" Movement today in the people's capital. He analyzed the situation in North China at the time of the "December 9th" Movement in comparison with the current situation. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionary government signed a traitorous treaty with Japan, and the central army and the Kuomintang party headquarters withdrew from Hebei and Chahar. Chiang Kai-shek and Song Zheyuan were competing to betray the country. However, the Red Army, which marched north to resist Japan after the 25,000-mile Long March, and the anti-Japanese salvation movement launched by students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, struck a blow to the plans of the traitors and national betrayers to sell North China and sell China, and prepared for the War of Resistance against Japan ideologically, politically, and among the masses. He continued, "It has been fourteen years since the 'December 9th' Movement. In these fourteen years, the world situation has undergone great changes. Three of the world's six powerful imperialist countries have been overthrown, and the remaining three have also been crippled. China, which was precarious and clamoring for national salvation fourteen years ago, has now stood up and established the powerful People's Republic of China. The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is now incomparably strong." He said that the victory was achieved through three key factors: the leadership of the Communist Party, the people's armed forces, and the united front. These are the basic conditions for overthrowing imperialism and reactionaries. These three experiences were summarized by Chairman Mao in his "Foreword to 'The Communist.'" These three important experiences are also applicable and correct in explaining the changes in the world situation over the past fourteen years.

Comrade Peng Zhen then talked about how Chinese students can train themselves to become good cadres. He said: "'May Fourth', 'May 30th', 'September 18th', 'December 9th', 'December 1st', as well as the anti-violence and anti-hunger movements, each produced a group of revolutionary intellectual cadres. Many of the cadres during the 'December 9th' Movement became the backbone of our work in the North China Liberated Area and Tianjin and Beijing today, but there were also some who "bloomed but did not bear fruit," degenerated, or drifted away. This provides a valuable experience: intellectuals who combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers will achieve success and have a bright future; conversely, those who do not combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers will hardly achieve any success, or only be a flash in the pan. Secondly, Comrade Peng Zhen also explained that intellectuals must arm their minds with Marxism-Leninism, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve anything. After repeated explanations, he finally called on the students to closely combine with the workers and the working people, and called on the students to earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and earnestly study Chairman Mao, which he offered as a gift to the students on the 14th anniversary of the "December 9th."

    彭真同志讲话摘要
    【北京讯】彭真同志在北京市纪念“一二、九”“一二、一”晚会上的讲话摘要。
    彭真同志说：“一二、九”是值得中国人民纪念的，“一二、九”运动在中国历史上写下了光辉的一页，我们今天在人民的首都纪念“一二、九”运动是有很重大的意义的。他与现在的情况对照着分析了在“一二、九”运动当时华北的局势，那时国民党反动政府与日本订了卖国条约，中央军和国民党党部从冀察撤走，蒋介石和宋哲元在作卖国的竞争。但是当时经过二万五千里长征北上抗日的红军和“一二、九”学生发动的国民党统治区的救亡抗日的运动，打击了汉奸卖国贼们出卖华北出卖中国的计划，并在思想上政治上在群众中为抗日战争作了准备工作。他继续说，“一二、九”运动现在已经十四年了，这十四年世界情况有了很大的变化，世界上六个强大的帝国主义有三个被打倒了，剩下的三个也有的被打瘸了；十四年前朝不保夕高呼救亡的中国，现在已经站立起来，成立了强大的中华人民共和国，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营今天已经无比的强大。他说这个胜利之取得，有三个关键：就是共产党的领导，人民的武装和统一战线。这是打倒帝国主义和反动派的基本条件。这三条经验在毛主席著的“共产党人发刊词”就总结出了。这三个重要的经验用来说明十四年来世界形势的变化也是适用的，正确的。
    彭真同志继即讲到中国学生怎样把自己锻炼成为一个很好的干部。他说：“五四”、“五卅”、“九、一八”、“一二、九”、“一二、一”以及抗暴、反饥饿等运动，每次都产生了一批革命的知识分子干部，“一二、九”运动时期的干部很多都成为我们今天华北解放区和京津两地工作的骨干，但也有一些人“开花没有结实”，堕落了或者是不知飘流到那里去了。这里提供了一条很宝贵的经验，知识分子凡是与工、农、兵相结合的都有成就，有远大前途；反之，凡是不与工、农、兵相结合的，就很难有任何成就，或者只是昙花一现。其次彭真同志又说明了知识分子必须用马列主义来武装自己的头脑，不然也就很难有何成就。在经过反复说明之后，最后他号召同学们密切地与工人与劳动人民相结合，号召同学们认真地学习马列主义，认真地学习毛主席，他以此作为在“一二、九”十四周年纪念日献给同学们的礼物。
