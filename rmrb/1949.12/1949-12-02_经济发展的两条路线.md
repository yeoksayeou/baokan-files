　　Two Paths of Economic Development
    By Lieontev, translated by Fu Ying
    In the "New Era" issue 37 article, "The Collapse of the Myth of Western European Economic Recovery," it was explained that the officially announced goals of the Marshall Plan have been proven by facts to be shameless deceptions. However, the American monopoly capitalists and their Western European agents knew from the beginning that the Marshall Plan was not designed to promote the economic recovery of Western Europe. The fact that Western European economic recovery has not been achieved does not disturb these figures. What makes them uneasy is something else. It is not only that the officially announced goals of the Marshall Plan have been declared a failure, but that its true, but carefully concealed, goals have also failed – this is an increasingly evident fact.
    It is no secret that the Marshall Plan was initially used as a means to realize the American financial capital's crazy plan to establish its world hegemony. To achieve this goal, the strategists of the Marshall Plan formulated a policy to ensure:
    First, to export panic and unemployment from the United States, in other words, to solve the internal contradictions of American capitalism by economically and politically enslaving Western European countries;
    Second, to prevent the economic recovery and further development of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries;
    Third, to unite the forces of the international imperialist and reactionary camp, led by the American financial groups, to defeat the modern progressive forces, and to forcibly establish the world hegemony of American imperialism.
    To what extent have these true goals of the Marshall Plan been accomplished?
    To answer this question, we must look at the facts again.

    　　　　I. Important Capitalist Countries Suffer from Economic Panic
    The initiators of the Marshall Plan told the American people that the Marshall Plan would guarantee a market for American goods and a place for American capital to invest. The "export of panic" and the "export of unemployment" are theories extremely favored by Wall Street's learned servants. They firmly believe that panic and unemployment can be exported to other countries like any other commodity.
    These theories are the product of extreme ignorance and selfishness of private capital. It cannot stand the test. Facts have proved that panic and unemployment are extremely difficult to truly export; when panic and unemployment are exported, it does not reduce America's own panic and unemployment, but rather increases them. The Marshall Plan enslaved Western European countries to Wall Street, which made the serious economic disease of the United States spread to Western Europe faster. The Marshall Plan enabled American monopoly capitalists to obtain huge profits. However, it did not solve the internal contradictions of American capitalism, but undoubtedly promoted the more rapid deterioration of the American economic situation.
    By the end of 1948, the American economy had clearly turned for the worse and was heading towards panic.
    The causes of the American economic panic exist in the nature of capitalism, especially in the nature of modern monopoly capitalism. On the one hand, the living standards of the working masses are declining, and on the other hand, the profits of monopoly capital are increasing disproportionately. As a result, fatal contradictions have occurred in the domestic market. The initiators of the Marshall Plan intended to compensate for the shrinking of the domestic market by squeezing foreign markets from weaker competitors. But the hope placed on foreign markets is equally unfounded.
    The United Nations Secretariat's World Economic Report pointed out that the industrial production of the United States in 1948 was only 3% higher than in 1947, decreased by 5% in the first quarter of 1948, and decreased by 9% in the manufacturing machinery industry.
    The decline in American industrial production was even more severe in the second quarter of 1949. The Federal Reserve Board's industrial production index was 162 in July, but 169 in June, 174 in May, and 195 in November last year.
    Thus, industrial production in July was 17% less than in November 1948, reaching the lowest level since May 1946. Washington's employed optimists pretended to find a glimmer of hope in the slight seasonal increase in the August index (in August, the index increased by a few points, but did not reach the June level). American newspapers used eye-catching headlines to publicize the quarterly report of the President's Economic Advisory Committee, which declared that, according to the August index, the "economic recession" had ended. But the history of the 1929-33 economic panic pointed out that slight seasonal fluctuations did not change the overall bleak situation. The profound reasons that caused the economic panic cannot be eliminated by temporary seasonal factors.
    The initial survey figures for September dispelled optimism completely. In September, the production of steel, coal, and oil all declined. In the week ending September 24, railway vehicle freight volume (which reflects the general economic situation of the country) decreased by 11% from the previous week and by 27.2% from the same week last year. Several economists employed by monopoly capital predicted that the industrial production index would fall to 150 by December or the beginning of next year, which means that production would be reduced by more than 23% compared to the autumn of 1948.
    The reactionary leaders of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations – who are the slaves of monopoly capital – boasted to American workers that the Marshall Plan would guarantee them jobs. This became a pure deception.
    The Marshall Plan did not prevent the increase in unemployment, but rather accelerated it. One of the main items of American exports is industrial machinery. However, as a result of the Marshall Plan, this export item was almost completely canceled, because American monopoly capital advocated a policy of prohibiting trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and refused to give industrial equipment to Western European countries, fearing that Western European countries would recover and become American competitors. The American trade union publication "Labor's Progress" said that by the end of 1948, the goods exported under the Marshall Plan were worth about 2 billion U.S. dollars, of which only 60 million U.S. dollars - or 3% - were machines. In the period from April 1948 to April 1949, 200,000 workers in the electrical industry and the manufacturing machinery industry were laid off.
    The American progressive publication "National Defender" recently commented sarcastically: "The price the United States pays for prohibiting trade with Russia, Eastern Europe, and New China is the loss of three million jobs for American workers. If trade between the East and the West is restored, three million workers will be able to find jobs."
    Unemployment is becoming an increasingly terrible problem in the United States. In the first quarter of 1949, the number of unemployed increased by nearly 70% compared to the fourth quarter of 1948. The number of fully unemployed reached 6 million, while the number of partially unemployed was more than 12 million. Interestingly, even the reactionary Republican Senator Malone also called the number of fully unemployed 6 million and the number of partially unemployed 16 million in a speech in the Senate in September. The National Committee of the American Progressive Party expects that the United States will have 10 million fully unemployed by winter.
    The continuous increase in unemployment and the continuous reduction in wages indicate the continuous decline in the living standards of the working class. Labor disputes have occurred successively in various industrial sectors. According to newspaper reports, the number of people involved in industrial disputes in the first half of September was more than 3 million. Regardless of the government's and the reactionary leaders of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations' efforts, social conflicts are still becoming increasingly violent and irreconcilable.
    The advocates of the Marshall Plan promised American farmers that their agricultural products would sell well in Western European markets. What is the reality?
    At the end of July, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a statement in response to many inquiries about the impact of the British dollar panic on U.S. agriculture. The U.S. Department of Agriculture pointed out that in the years before World War II, one-third of the food exported by the United States was sold to the United Kingdom; during World War II, the food exported by the United States accounted for about 45% of the sales to the United Kingdom; the Department of Agriculture then admitted that the measures taken by the United Kingdom to reduce the purchase of food from the United States was a serious blow to the export of American agricultural products.
    This situation has produced the most bizarre results. Denmark's "Berlingske Tidende" reported that the United States intends to force Marshall Plan recipients to purchase American agricultural products, whether they are willing to or not. As a result, Denmark, which was originally expected to export meat and milk products to the United States, will not be allowed to export to the United States; not only that, it will be forced to import these products from the United States.
    Particularly noteworthy is the failure of the Marshall Plan's expectations regarding the expansion of American foreign trade. Despite the Marshall Plan's subsidies, American exports in 1948 decreased by 18% in value and 23% in quantity compared to 1947. The percentage of American exports in the world decreased from 26% in the first quarter of 1948 to 21% in the fourth quarter.
    This year, American foreign trade declined again. Statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce indicate that exports in July this year were 896.6 million U.S. dollars, while exports in June this year were 1.1042 billion U.S. dollars, and exports in July 1948 were 1.0223 billion U.S. dollars. Exports in July were about 18% lower than the average monthly exports in the first half of this year. The exports of cotton, machinery, and vehicles declined the most. It is particularly interesting that, according to statistics from the Bureau of the Census, American exports to Marshall Plan recipients decreased from 406.7 million U.S. dollars in June to 279.8 million U.S. dollars in July.
    The import situation in the United States is equally bleak. According to statistics from the Department of Commerce, imports in July reached 455.55 million U.S. dollars, while imports in June this year were 526.7 million U.S. dollars, and imports in July 1948 were 558.55 million U.S. dollars. Imports in July 1949 were about 19% lower than the average monthly imports in the first half of this year. It is particularly interesting that, according to statistics from the Bureau of the Census, the total imports from Marshall Plan recipients in July reached 57.6 million U.S. dollars, while imports in June were 65.7 million U.S. dollars. In the first half of 1949, the average monthly imports from these countries were 82.3 million U.S. dollars, while the average monthly imports in 1948 were 91.4 million U.S. dollars.
    The panic in American foreign trade occurred at a time when the struggle for markets in the capitalist world was becoming increasingly fierce. The sharp decline in exports not only caused shock and concern among the American ruling groups, but also aggravated the internal contradictions of the American ruling groups, which split the ruling groups. In this situation, the increasingly fierce infighting within monopoly capital often arises, on the one hand, the monopoly capital seeking to expand the world market, and on the other hand, the monopoly capital mainly engaged in production for the domestic market. In the United States, the Republican Party has always represented the second aspect of monopoly capital. A typical example of this infighting occurred in the Senate when the Senate debated extending the so-called Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. In the debate, Taft, Vandenberg, Malone, Millikin, and similar Republican diehards criticized the Truman government for sacrificing the domestic market and allowing foreign goods to flow freely in order to encourage exports. After the debate, the term of the bill was extended on September 15. The amendment proposed by the Republican Party was supported by 35 Republicans and 3 Democrats, but 43 Democrats voted against it, and the amendment was rejected. The meaning of the Senate resolution is that the Truman government will make more unconstrained efforts to destroy all obstacles in other countries to the import of American goods.
    But neither the extension of reciprocal trade agreements nor the hasty devaluation of the pound and more than a dozen other currencies (European, Asian, African and Australian currencies) ordered by Washington can improve the economic prospects of American capitalism. The reaction of the New York Stock Exchange to the successive devaluations of various currencies was a sharp drop in American stock prices, which is very interesting. Washington's economic doctors are unable to eliminate the deep-rooted causes of the diseases of American capitalism. Its festering sores are nakedly exposed, making people sick to their stomachs.

    　　　　II. The Soviet Union's Huge Economic Progress and the Economic Achievements of the People's Democratic Countries
    American monopoly capital refused to grant credit loans to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries under normal commercial conditions and imposed trade discrimination on the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, which is equivalent to implementing an economic blockade on these countries that have broken away from the imperialist camp; hoping to use these methods to undermine the economic recovery of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.
    But here too, American monopoly capital has made a big mistake.
    The Soviet Union, taking advantage of all the decisive advantages of the socialist economic system, was able to heal the serious damage caused by World War II and the German fascist occupation of a large part of Russian territory in an unprecedentedly short period. The Soviet people have achieved outstanding achievements in completing the great plan for peaceful economic development formulated by Comrade Stalin in his historic speech on February 9, 1946. In his speech commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Molotov was able to say that the total output of Soviet large-scale industry had reached the monthly average of 1940 in October 1947, which means that it had reached the pre-war level. The total volume of Soviet industrial production in 1948 exceeded that of 1940 by 18%.
    The Soviet economy continued its rapid expansion in the first half of 1949, and in June, the average daily output was 41% higher than the average daily output in 1940. In other words, Soviet industrial production in mid-1949 had exceeded the pre-war peak by two-fifths.
    It should be noted that the output of Soviet large-scale industry in 1940 was 11.7 times greater than that of pre-revolutionary Russia. Therefore, Soviet industrial production in mid-1949 was 16.5 times greater than in 1913. Let's mention the situation in Western European countries such as Britain and France for comparison. In Western European countries such as Britain and France, industrial production has stagnated at the level of 1913 in the past 35 years, while American industrial production is about twice that of 1913. We must also remember that for nearly a quarter of this period, the Soviet Union was engaged in resisting the armed aggression of a powerful and dangerous enemy, while the United States did not have a single enemy soldier set foot on its territory during this period, but made a fortune from the two world wars.
    The total output of Soviet industry in the second quarter of 1949 was 20% higher than in the second quarter of 1948. In other words, in one year, the volume of Soviet industrial production increased by one-fifth. In this year, the volume of industrial production in all capitalist countries decreased significantly.
    American millionaires harbor the crazy belief that without their restrictive "aid," the Soviet Union will not be able to achieve its post-war five-year plan. But the facts have proved that the Soviet people not only completed the bold goals of the post-war five-year plan, but also greatly exceeded them.
    The most advanced industrial factories in the Soviet Union issued a call to complete the five-year plan in four years, and millions of workers responded to this call. The struggle to complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule filled the builders of communism with fresh vitality and creativity.
    The socialist system not only guarantees the rapid development of industry, but also guarantees the rapid development of agriculture. Molotov described the development of Soviet agriculture in his speech commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution:
    "Our agriculture, nourished by the lifeblood of collective labor, is getting stronger year by year. If there had been no war – the war destroyed many of our best agricultural areas – our supply of various goods today would be much better than any country in Europe, and would be more than just better than the countries in Europe."
    The severe damage suffered by Soviet agriculture in the war was healed very quickly. In 1948, the total grain harvest had reached the level of the pre-war year of 1940, and the average harvest per hectare had exceeded that of the pre-war period. Livestock breeding also advanced rapidly. From July 1, 1948, to July 1, 1949, the number of large horned cattle in collective farms increased by 20%, the number of pigs increased by 79%, and the number of sheep and goats increased by 11%.
    The Stalin plan to transform the Russian steppe and forest-steppe regions has opened up new prospects for the rapid progress of socialist agriculture; collective farm peasants have welcomed this plan with great enthusiasm. The planting plan for protective belts has been exceeded.
    One of the characteristics of socialism is that it not only guarantees the continuous increase in output, but also guarantees the planned improvement of the material welfare of the working people. The continuous improvement of the people's living standards is an unchangeable law of socialism. With the expansion of production, the number of workers also increases. Labor productivity increases, and the prices of general consumer goods decrease. Workers' real wages increase, which means that people's purchasing power increases. In this case, phenomena such as panic and unemployment are completely impossible.
    In 1948, the real income of Soviet manual laborers and office workers was twice that of 1947. On March 1, 1949, state retail prices were reduced again, which means that the living standards of the Soviet people were greatly improved once again. In the second quarter of this year, state-owned and cooperative retail trade was 19% greater than in the second quarter of last year (with prices converted to be comparable); the meat purchased by the people increased by 51% compared to the same period last year, sugar increased by 17%, and confectionery increased by 40%.
    The outstanding achievements of the Soviet economy are of great significance. They provide more evidence to the world that Stalin's words are true. Stalin said:
    "The capitalist economic system is bankrupt and unstable; it is outdated and must give way to another higher economic system, that is, the Soviet socialist economic system; only the Soviet economic system is not afraid of panic and can overcome the difficulties that capitalism cannot solve."
    "The People's Democratic countries, learning from the Soviet Union to break away from the imperialist camp, have begun to strive for socialism. Their economic recovery and progress are also proceeding rapidly. In Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, although the level of economic development varies, their industry and agriculture are progressing rapidly, and at the same time, the living standards of their people are improving.
    American usurers firmly believe that the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe (which were economically weak in the past and enslaved by the imperialist powers) cannot recover from the destruction of the war. The Atlantic Westlocks were waiting with open mouths for these countries to come and beg them. Their estimates were completely wrong.
    They did not take into account the most important thing – the role of the Soviet Union. The People's Democratic countries have received strong support from their great friend since the first day of their liberation. The People's Democratic countries have received the selfless fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, and their effective cooperation has enabled them to quickly restore their economies and move forward with confidence. The drastic economic reforms implemented in these countries have laid the foundation for taking the path of socialist development. Abolishing the rule of landlords and capitalists and turning to the road of socialist construction has aroused the energy and labor enthusiasm of millions of workers, peasants, and advanced intellectuals.
    The basic task of the first two-year economic plan and three-year economic plan of the People's Democratic countries was to repair the damage suffered by their national economies from the war and the German occupation. By 1948, these countries had exceeded their pre-war industrial production levels: Czechoslovakia exceeded by 10%, Bulgaria exceeded by 71.5%, Poland exceeded by 21%, and Hungary exceeded by 27%. Although they suffered from war damage and three consecutive years of poor harvests in this part of Europe, the agriculture of the People's Democratic countries recovered quickly. In general, the grain production of these countries, calculated per capita, was 5.8% higher in 1948 than before the war. In the past, the budgets of these countries were in deficit, and they could only balance their budgets by borrowing (these debts were often attached to enslaving conditions). Now they have quickly put their finances on the right track and balanced their budgets.
    In the first half of 1949, the People's Democratic countries achieved new achievements in all economic sectors.
    Czechoslovakia completed its two-year plan ahead of schedule and started its first five-year plan on January 1, 1949. In the first half of this year, its industry (excluding food) exceeded its plan by 1.9%. In agricultural Slovakia, vast industrial development is now underway, exceeding its plan by 5%.
    In Poland, the goods produced by state-owned industry (including 90% of the total industrial capacity) in the first half of 1949 were 24% more than in the first half of 1948, completing 109% of the plan.
    In Romania, the 1949 national plan stipulates that the total industrial production volume will increase by 40%, and the result is that the plan has been exceeded. Industrial renovation completed 107.4% of the second quarter plan, the steel industry completed 117% of its plan, the building materials industry completed 108% of its plan, and the food industry completed 113% of its plan.
    In Bulgaria, industrial production in the second quarter of this year exceeded the second quarter of 1948 by 37.7%. Bulgarian agriculture has also made significant progress.
    In Hungary, the industrial production plan for the first half of 1949 was achieved by 103.5%, which increased the volume of industrial production in the first half of 1948 by 27.1%. The number of workers increased by 100,000 in the first half of this year. Hungary will complete its first three-year plan this year, seven months ahead of the original schedule, and will then start its first five-year plan.
    Albania, one of the most economically backward countries in Europe, is now progressing rapidly. New industrial factories are starting work. Recently celebrated the groundbreaking ceremony of a large textile factory.
    The completion and exceeding of the economic plan is largely due to the labor enthusiasm shown by the working class – the leading class in the People's Democratic countries. Labor competition has become a movement that includes millions of working people.
    Until recently, the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe reacted extremely quickly to the fluctuations of the capitalist world market, and each panic in the capitalist world had a serious impact on them. But now, all of this is just a memory of the evil past. These People's Democratic countries have broken away from the imperialist system and have begun to lay the socialist foundation, getting rid of the great evils of the bourgeois system such as economic panic and unemployment.
    After the American imperialists' plan to strangle the People's Democratic countries with an economic blockade went bankrupt, they began to actively use other more despicable methods to occupy the people who had broken away from capitalism, arranging extremely evil conspiracies, and using saboteurs, spies, and hired murderers as vicious weapons. With the fascist provocateurs buried in Belgrade at their disposal, American special agents and diplomats used despicable special agent methods to oppose the People's Republics of Central and Southeast Europe. The trial of Rajk and his accomplices proved that these hopes of Wall Street are doomed to complete failure due to the vigilance of the people of the People's Democratic countries and their loyalty to the people's democratic system and to socialism.
    What is happening in the socialist camp not only confirms the tremendous creative potential of the socialist system, but is also an irrefutable indictment of capitalism (capitalism that plunges people into economic panic and unemployment). London's "New Statesman and Nation" tells us that a Scandinavian banker expressed the thoughts that troubled the representatives of his class very well. He said:
    "People used to think that unemployment came down from the sky; but they now know better. They know where unemployment comes from, and this is important."
    It can be seen that the hope of the initiators of the Marshall Plan that their policies would prevent the economic development of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries has gone bankrupt. The prosperity of the Soviet Union and the steady progress of the People's Democratic countries stand in stark contrast to the economic chaos and disintegration of the Marshall Plan recipients and the entire capitalist camp. Capitalist countries are increasingly sinking into the mire of another devastating panic.
    The Marshall Plan has two basic estimates, - that is, the hope to save American capitalism from panic, and the hope to prevent the economic development of socialist countries - the miscarriage of these two estimates will inevitably aggravate the contradictions in the imperialist camp. Imperialists cannot eliminate these contradictions, just as they cannot stop the Earth from revolving around the sun.

　　经济发展的两条路线
    列昂节夫著  福英译
    在“新时代”第三十七期“西欧经济复兴底神话之坍台”一文中，说明了马歇尔计划底官方宣布的目标已被事实证明是无耻的欺骗。但是，美国的独占资本家及其西欧代理人开始就已完全知道马歇尔计划并不是为促进西欧底经济复兴而设计的。西欧经济复兴没有实现，这一事实本身，不会使这些人物感觉不安。使他们不安的，是别的事情。不仅是马歇尔计划底官方宣布的目标已宣告失败，其真正的但小心掩蔽的目标也告失败；——这是日益彰明的一件事实。
    一开始就已把马歇尔计划作为实现美国金融资本建立其世界霸权底疯狂计划之一种手段；这已不是什么秘密。为要达到这一目的，马歇尔计划战略家们拟定了这样的一种政策，即它要保证：
    第一，从美国把恐慌和失业输出去，换一句话说，以西欧诸国底经济的和政治的奴役来解决美国资本主义底内部矛盾；
    第二，阻止苏联与人民民主国家底经济的恢复与更向前发展；
    第三，把国际的帝国主义的和反动的阵营底力量统一起来，由美国的财阀为首，以击败现代的进步力量，并以强力建立美国帝国主义底世界霸权。
    马歇尔计划底这些真正目标，已完成到什么地步呢？
    要回答这个问题，我们必须再看看事实。
    　　　　一、重要的资本主义国度陷于经济恐慌之苦痛中
    马歇尔计划底创议者向美国民众说，马歇尔计划会保证美国货物有市场，美国资本有投资地方。“恐慌底输出”与“失业底输出”是华尔街博学的仆役们所极喜欢的理论。深信谓恐慌与失业是能够象任何其他商品一样输出到别国去的。
    这些理论，是私人资本底极端无识与自私自利底产物。它经不起考验。事实证明了恐慌与失业是极难真正输出的；当把恐慌与失业输出时，并不使美国自己的恐慌与失业减轻，而反是使其增加。马歇尔计划使西欧诸国受华尔街所奴役，这就使美国底严重的经济病传染到西欧去得更快。马歇尔计划使美国独占资本家获得丰厚的利润。但是，它并没有解决美国资本主义底内部矛盾，而是无疑问地促使美国经济地位更迅速恶化。
    在一九四八年年底，美国经济已显然转向恶化，趋向恐慌了。
    美国经济恐慌底原因，存在于资本主义底本质之中，尤其是现代独占资本主义底本质之中。一方面是劳动群众底生活标准之日益降低，另一方面是独占资本底利润之不配称的增加，结果是本国市场发生了致命的矛盾。马歇尔计划底创议者打算从较弱的竞争者压得外国的市场，来补偿本国的市场底缩小。但寄托于国外市场的希望，也同样是毫无根据的。
    联合国秘书处底世界经济报告指出美国一九四八年的工业生产，比一九四七年只高百分之三，一九四八年第一季下降了百分之五，而制造机器的工业则下降达百分之九。
    美国工业生产之下降，在一九四九年第二季更加厉害。联邦准备局工业生产指数七月份为一六二，但六月份为一六九，五月份为一七四，去年十一月份则为一九五。
    这样看来，七月工业生产是比一九四八年十一月减少百分之十七，达到自一九四六年五月以来的最低水平。华盛顿的雇用的乐观主义者们假装在八月份的指数底季节性的些微上升（在八月时，指数增加了几点，但没有达到六月份水平）发现了一线希望。美国报纸以醒目的大标题宣传美国总统经济顾问委员会底一季报告，该报告宣称，根据八月指数，“经济衰退”已告结束。但一九二九——三三年经济恐慌底历史指出：些微的季节性的波动并没有改变整个的黯淡的情况。引起经济恐慌之深邃的原因，不是暂时的季节性的因素所能消除的。
    九月份的最初的调查所得数字，就把乐观主义打消得一干二净了。九月间，钢、煤、与石油底生产都下降。截至九月二十四日为止的一个星期中，铁道车辆运货量（这反映全国一般经济状况）比上星期降低了百分之十一，比去年同一星期降低了百分之二七．二。被独占资本所雇用的经济学者们，有几位预言工业生产指数至十二月或明年年头将下降为一五○，这即是说，与一九四八年秋季比较，生产降低了百分之二十三以上。
    美国劳动联盟与产业工会联合会底反动领袖们——他们是独占资本底奴才——向美国工人夸下海口，说马歇尔计划会保证他们有工可做。这成为纯粹骗人的话。
    马歇尔计划并不能阻止失业之增加，反而是使失业增加得更快。美国输出底主要项目之一是工业的机器。但马歇尔计划之结果，几乎使这一项输出完全取消了，因为美国独占资本拥护禁止与苏联及人民民主国家贸易之政策，而且拒绝以工业设备给予西欧诸国，生怕西欧诸国恢复成为美国的竞争者。美国职工会刊物“劳动底行进”说，到了一九四八年年底，在马歇尔计划下输出的物品约值二十亿美元，其中只有六千万美元——或百分之三，是机器。在一九四八年四月至一九四九年四月这一个时期中，电器工业与制造机器工业的工人被解雇的有二十万人。
    美国进步派刊物“全国保卫者”最近很辛辣地评论道：“美国禁止与俄国、东欧、及新中国贸易，其代价是美国工人丧失了三百万个职位，如果恢复东方与西方的贸易，就能够使三百万工人有工可做。”
    失业在美国成为一个日益可怕的问题。在一九四九年第一季，失业人数比一九四八年第四季增加了将近百分之七十。完全失业者底人数达六百万人，而部分失业者底人数则在一千二百万人以上。很有意思地，连反动的共和党参议员马龙九月间在参议院演说时也称完全失业者底人数为六百万，而部分失业者底人数为一千六百万。美国进步党全国委员会预料美国到冬天将有一千万完全失业者。
    失业不断增加而工资不断降低，就表示着劳动阶级底生活标准不断下降。劳资纠纷在各工业部门相继发生。据报纸报导，九月上半月工业纠纷所涉及的人数在三百万人以上。不顾政府与反动的美国劳动联盟及产业工会联合会领袖们底一切努力，社会的冲突仍然是日益猛烈与不能调和。
    马歇尔计划底主张者向美国农民答应说，他们的农产品在西欧市场中会畅销。现实情形是怎样的呢？
    在七月末，美国农业发表了一个声明，答复许多人询问关于英国美元恐慌对美国农业有何影响的问题。美国农业部指出了在第二次世界大战以前的几年中，美国所输出的食物，有三分之一是卖给英国；在第二次世界大战期间，美国所输出的食物卖给英国的约占百分之四十五；农业部接着承认英国采取减少向美国地区购买食物之措施，对美国农业品的输出是一个严重的打击。
    这种情况产生了最稀奇古怪的结果。丹麦的“柏林斯克日报”报导说，美国打算强迫马歇尔计划受援国购买美国的农产品，不管愿意与否。结果，丹麦本来是预期将肉和牛乳产品向美国输出的，将不被允许向美国输出；不仅如是，将被强迫从美国输入这些产品。
    特别显著的，是马歇尔计划关于美国国外贸易扩张之预期，宣告失败。虽有马歇尔计划之补助，美国在一九四八年的输出按价值计算是比一九四七年降低百分之十八，按数量计算是降低百分之二十三。美国在全世界输出所占的百分比，在一九四八年第一季为百分之二十六，在第四季降为百分之二十一。
    今年，美国国外贸易再行下降。美国商业部统计数字指出今年七月份输出八亿九千六百六十万美元，而今年六月份则为十一亿零四百二十万元，一九四八年七月份则为十亿二千二百三十万元。七月份的输出，比今年上半年每月平均输出约低百分之十八。棉花、机器和车辆底输出，下降得最厉害。特别有意思的是，根据国势调查局底统计数字，美国向马歇尔计划受援国的输出，由六月份为四亿零六百七十万美元，至七月份则降为二亿七千九百八十万美元。
    美国输入情况也同样黯淡。根据商业部底统计数字，七月份的输入达四亿五千五百五十万美元，而今年六月份为五亿二千六百七十万元，一九四八年七月份则为五亿五千八百五十万元。一九四九年七月份输入，比今年上半年每月平均输入约低百分之十九。特别有意思的是，根据国势调查局底统计数字，从马歇尔计划受援国的输入，在七月份的总数达五千七百六十万美元，而在六月份则为六千五百七十万元。在一九四九年上半年，从这些国家的输入，每月平均为八千二百三十万美元，而在一九四八年的每月平均则为九千一百四十万元。
    美国国外贸易的恐慌，是在资本主义世界中争夺市场的斗争日益猛烈时发生的。输出之急激下降，不仅引起了美国统治集团吃惊和担心，而且使美国统治集团底内部矛盾加剧，这种内部矛盾使统治集团分裂。在这种场合，时常引起独占资本内部争吵之日益猛烈，一方面是争求扩张世界市场的独占资本，另一方面是那些主要是为国内市场而从事生产的独占资本。在美国，共和党历来是代表着第二方面的独占资本。这种争吵底典型例子，发生于参议院，当参议院辩论延长所谓互惠贸易协定法案时。在的辩论中，塔虎特、范登堡、马龙、密里金、和同类的共和党顽固人物，斥责杜鲁门政府为了鼓励输出，而牺牲国内市场，让外国货物自由。经过了辩论之后，才于九月十五日延长该法案底年期。共和党所提出的修正案，得到三十五位共和党人和三位民主党人之支持，但有四十三位民主党人投票反对，修正案被否决。参议院决议案底意思是说，杜鲁门政府将更不拘形迹地努力摧毁别国对于美国货物输入之一切障碍。
    但不论是互惠贸易协定之延长，或是金镑以及十几种其他货币（欧洲的、亚洲的、非洲的和澳洲的货币）由华盛顿下令而仓促贬值，都不能改善美国资本主义底经济前途。美国纽约证券交易对于各国货币相继贬值之反应是美国证券价格暴跌，这是很有意思的。华盛顿的经济医生没有能力消除美国资本主义底疾病底根深蒂固的原因。其腐臭的疮，赤裸裸的暴露出来，令世人见之作呕。
    　　　　二、苏联底经济巨大进步与人民民主国家底经济成就
    美国独占资本拒绝依照正常商业条件给予苏联与人民民主国家信用贷款，并对苏联与人民民主国家加以贸易歧视，等于对这些已脱离了帝国主义阵营的国家实施经济封锁；希望用这些方法破坏苏联与人民民主国家底经济复兴。
    但在这里美国独占资本也估计得大错特错了。
    苏联利用了社会主义的经济制度所有的决定性的优点，能够在空前的短促的时间，医治了第二次世界大战与德国法西斯占领俄国很大部分国土所引起的严重的破坏。苏联人民在完成斯大林同志于一九四六年二月九日在其有历史意义的演说中所制定的和平经济发展底伟大计划时，获得了杰出的成就。莫洛托夫在纪念伟大十月社会主义革命三十周年的演说中，能够说出苏联大规模工业底总生产量在一九四七年十月已达到一九四○年每月平均数，这即是说，已达到战前水平。苏联工业生产总量，在一九四八年已比一九四○年超过了百分之十八。
    苏联经济在一九四九年上半年继续其迅速的扩张，在六月，每日平均产量已比一九四○年的每日平均产量高出百分之四十一。换言之，苏联工业生产在一九四九年中叶已比战前最高峰超出了五分之二。
    应该注意，苏联大规模工业底生产量在一九四○年已比革命前的俄国大了一一．七倍。因此，苏联工业生产在一九四九年中叶比一九一三年大了一六．五倍。我们提一提西欧国家如英国法国的情形，来比较一下吧。西欧国家象英国法国，其工业生产在过去三十五年中，停滞于一九一三年的水平，而美国工业生产也大约为一九一三年之两倍。我们还须记得，这一时期底将近四分之一的时间，苏联是在从事抵抗强大的和危险的敌人底武装进攻，而美国在这一时期却没有一个敌国士兵踏上其国土，却是从这两次世界大战发洋财。
    苏联工业总产量在一九四九年第二季比一九四八年第二季高出百分之二十。换一句话说，在一年之中，苏联工业生产量增加了五分之一。这一年，一切资本主义国家底工业生产量却大减特减。
    美国富翁们抱着这样的一种疯狂的信念，以为没有他们的束缚性的“援助”，苏联就不能实现其战后五年计划。但事实证明苏联人民不仅完成了战后五年计划底大胆的目标，而且是大大地超过。
    苏联底最前进的工业工厂发布了五年计划四年完成之号召，而成百万的工人响应此一号召。为提前完成五年计划之斗争，使共产主义底建设者们都充满着新鲜的活力与创造性。
    社会主义制度既保证了工业底迅速发展，也保证了农业底迅速发展。莫洛托夫在纪念伟大十月社会主义革命三十周年的演说中，描写苏联农业底发展说：
    “我国农业，获得了集体劳动底生命液汁之滋养，一年比一年强大。如果没有战争——战争破坏了我国许多最好的农业区域——我们今天各种物品的供给会比欧洲任何国家好得多，而且会不只单是比欧洲的国家好。”
    苏联农业所遭受的战争的重创，治好得非常快。在一九四八年，谷物总收获量已达到了战前一九四○年底水平，而每公亩的平均收获量则已超过战前。牲畜饲养业也迅速前进。从一九四八年七月一日到一九四九年七月一日，集体农场中的大角的牲口数目增加了百分之二十，猪底数目增加了百分之七十九，绵羊和山羊底数目增加了百分之十一。
    改变俄国大草原与森林草原地区的斯大林计划，展开了社会主义农业迅速进步底新的前途；集体农场农民以极大的热诚欢迎此一计划。护卫地带的种植计划已被超过。
    社会主义底特征之一，就是它不仅保证了产量之继续不断增加，而且保证了劳动人民底物质福利之有计划的改善，人民底生活标准之继续不断提高，是社会主义底不变的法则。随着生产扩张，劳动阶级人数也增加。劳动生产力提高，而一般消费品底价格则下降。工人底实在工资增加，这意味着人民购买力增加。在这种情况下，象恐慌和失业这类的现象是完全不能发生的。
    在一九四八年，苏联体力劳动者与办公室劳动者底实在收，比一九四七年多一倍。在一九四九年三月一日国营零售价格再行削低，这意味着苏联人民底生活标准再一次地大提高。在今年第二季，国营和合作社的零售贸易，比去年第二季（把价格改为能相比的）大百分之十九；人民所购买的肉类比去年同一时期增加百分之五十一，糖增加百之十七，糖果增加百分之四十。
    苏联经济底杰出的成就，是有重大的意义的。它们向全世界提出更多的证据，证明斯大林底话是千真万确的。斯大林说：
    “资本主义的经济制度是破产的和不稳定的；它已过时，必须让位给另一较高的经济制度，即苏维埃的社会主义的经济制度；只有苏维埃经济制度才不怕会发生恐慌，才能够克服资本主义所不能解决的困难。”
    “人民民主国家，学着苏联脱离了帝国主义阵营，已开始为社会主义而奋斗。它们的经济恢复和进步，也进行得很快。在波兰、匈牙利、捷克斯拉夫、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、和阿尔马尼亚这些国家中，其经济发展底水平虽不同，但其工业和农业都进步得很快，同时，其人民大众底生活标准也提高。
    美国高利贷者深信：中欧和东南欧的国家（它们过去在经济上很弱，且被帝国主义强国所奴役），不能从战争底破坏恢复过来。大西洋彼岸的西洛克张着他们的嘴唇等待着这些国家来祈求他们。他们的估计是大错而特错了。
    他们没有计及最重要的一件事——苏联底作用。人民民主国家自其解放的第一天开始，就已得到他们的伟大的朋友底强有力的支持。人民民主国家得到苏联底无私心的兄弟般的援助，它们之间的相互的有效的合作，使得它们能够迅速地恢复其经济，并有信心地向前进。在这些国家中所实行的激烈的经济改革，奠下了采取社会主义发展道路之基础。废除地主与资本家底统治与转向社会主义建设底道路，唤起千百万的工人、农民与前进知识分子的精力与劳动热诚。
    人民民主国家底第一届二年经济计划和三年经济计划，其基本任务是修复其国民经济所遭受的战争与德国占领之破坏。到了一九四八年，这些国家都已超过其战前工业生产水平：捷克超过百分之十，保加利亚超过百分之七十一点五，波兰超过百分之二十一，匈牙利超过百分之二十七。虽然遭受了战争破坏以及欧洲这一带地方连续三年歉收，人民民主国家的农业恢复得很快。总的来说，这些国家的谷物生产，如按每一人口计算，一九四八年比战前高出百分之五点八。从前这些国家底预算是入不敷出，只有借债（这些债常附有奴役的条件）才能使出入相抵，现在它们已很快地使其财政依循着正确的路线，并平衡其预算。
    在一九四九年上半年，人民民主国家在一切经济部门中都获得了新的成就。
    捷克提前完成其两年计划，并在一九四九年一月一日开始其第一个五年计划。在今年上半年，其工业（食物除外）超过其计划百分之一点九。在农业的斯洛伐基亚，广大的工业发展现在在进行中，超过其计划百分之五。
    在波兰，国有的工业（包括总工业能力底百分之九十）所生产的货物，在一九四九年上半年比一九四八年上半年多百分之二十四，完成计划百分之一百零九。
    在罗马尼亚，一九四九年的国家计划，规定工业总生产量增加百分之四十，结果是超过了计划。工业整修完成了第二季计划百分之一百零七点四，钢铁工业完成其计划百分之一百十七，建筑原料工业完成百分之一百零八，食物工业完成百分之一百十三。
    在保加利亚，工业生产在今年第二季是比一九四八年第二季超出百分之三十七点七。保加利亚农业也同样有重大进步。
    在匈牙利，一九四九年上半年工业生产计划实现了百分之一百零三点五，这比一九四八年上半年工业生产量增加了百分之二十七点一。工人人数在今年上半年增加了十万人。匈牙利将在今年完成其第一个三年计划，照原来的时间表提前了七个月，并将接着开始其第一个五年计划。
    阿尔巴尼亚是欧洲经济最落后的国家之一，现在进步得很快。新的工业的工厂正在开始工作。最近庆祝一个大纺织工厂奠基典礼。
    经济计划之所以完成和超过，大部分要归功于劳动阶级——人民民主国家中的领导阶级——所表现的劳动热情。劳动竞赛变成为包括成千百万劳动人民的运动。
    直至最近，中欧和东南欧诸国，对于资本主义世界市场的波动，反应得极快，资本主义世界的每次恐慌都对它们发生严重的影响。但现在，这一切已只是罪恶的过去底记忆了。这些人民民主国家脱离了帝国主义制度，并开始奠下社会主义基础，摆脱了资产阶级制度底巨大罪恶如经济恐慌和失业。
    美国帝国主义者打算以经济封锁来扼杀人民民主国家，这个计算破产之后，他们就开始日益积极地用其他的更卑劣的方法来向那些脱离了资本主义的人民作占，布置罪在恶极的阴谋，使用破坏分子、间谍和雇佣谋杀凶手这些恶毒的武器。有其在贝尔格勒特所埋藏的法西斯挑拨分子可供其驱使，美国特务和外交人员使用了可鄙的特务方法来反对中欧和东南欧的人民共和国。拉伊克及其同谋者底审判，证明了华尔街底这些希望，由于人民民主国家底人民底警惕和他们对于人民民主制度与对于社会主义之忠诚，注定是要完全失败的。
    在社会主义阵营中所发生的事情，不仅证实了社会主义制度有奇巨的创造的潜能，同时又是对资本主义（资本主义使人民陷于经济恐慌与失业）的无可驳的控诉。伦敦的“新政治家与民族”告诉我们，有一位斯干的那维亚的银行家把他的阶级底代表们所十分烦恼的思想表达得很好。他说：
    “人民过去常以为失业是从天降下来的；但他们现在知道得更清楚了。他们知道失业是从何而来，而这是重要的。”
    这样可以看出，马歇尔计划底创议者之期望他们的政策将阻止苏联与人民民主国家底经济发展，这种希望已破产了。苏联底繁盛与人民民主国家底稳步前进，与马歇尔计划受援国以及整个资本主义阵营底经济的混乱及瓦解，成一明显的对比。资本主义国家正在日益沈没于另一次毁灭性的恐慌底泥沼中。
    马歇尔计划基本有两个估计，——即希望把美国资本主义从恐慌挽救出来，并希望阻止社会主义国家底经济发展——这两个估计之流产，必然加重了帝国主义阵营中的矛盾。帝国主义者已不能消除这些矛盾，有如不能阻止地球绕日而运转一样。
