The Northeast Industrial Department recently issued instructions on further organizing and promoting the new record movement. The original text is as follows:

　　The new record movement has achieved great success in various factories and mines. At the same time, it has raised and exposed a series of problems that must be resolved quickly. The main one is how the leadership should cooperate with the mass movement to create collective new records. In other words, after more than two months of development, the new record movement has, on the one hand, created tremendous achievements and demonstrated the unparalleled wisdom of the working class. On the other hand, it has raised a new issue for all enterprise leading cadres.

　　Due to the uneven development of the movement, especially because the production organization and leadership in many factories and mines lag behind the development of the movement, there is a phenomenon of the entire production process being incompatible and unable to coordinate. For example, this group is setting new records, while that group is stuck in the old ways, disconnected from each other. Workers are constantly setting new records, but production organization and material supply remain the same, unable to keep up. On the one hand, there are complaints about insufficient machines and equipment, while on the other hand, a large number of machines and equipment are not being utilized. In the same factory, some workers are very busy, while others are idle and have no work to do, and so on.

　　All of this shows that the current new record movement has raised a series of new issues for our leadership organs at all levels, requiring the leadership to provide appropriate and timely solutions. Because, obviously, in the widespread development of new records in various factories and mines, some have already encountered, and some will encounter, the obstacles of the above problems. If these are not resolved in a timely manner, the vigorous new record movement will not be able to continue to develop smoothly, or hundreds and thousands of new records will not yield their fruits, and even new unreasonable phenomena will be formed due to the leadership's inability to organize well. That is to say, the new record movement now raises the following questions for the leading organs: to plan production according to the new situation; to organize and allocate labor resources according to the new situation; to organize the supply of raw materials according to the new situation; to utilize and adjust machinery and equipment according to the new situation; to improve labor conditions according to the new situation; to allocate cadres according to the new situation; to improve work systems and methods according to the new situation... and so on. In short, it is not enough to ask the workers to create new records. These problems must be solved from the leadership level. We must improve our production organization and management system from the leadership level, and strengthen the factory management committee in the process of the movement to create new records in leadership in order to promote the movement, to further deepen and broaden the movement, to organize all individual new records into a whole, and to ensure the completion and exceeding of production plans and production tasks. Actively and specifically solving these problems means guiding the movement from the front. Failure to solve these problems hinders the development of the movement and the improvement of production efficiency.

　　Changing Labor Organization and Adjusting Equipment Utilization

　　In the two months of the movement, the following experiences have been summarized:

　　In the new record movement, the Benxi Foundry found that the organization of labor was unreasonable, and cranes, drying furnaces, and factory buildings were sometimes idle without work, and sometimes everyone used them, and if they were not enough, they waited, wasting a lot of working hours. In order to overcome this phenomenon, the leadership accepted the advice of Soviet experts and consulted with veteran workers, changed the labor organization and operation methods, changed the practice of opening a furnace every three days to every two days, adjusted the use of equipment (cranes, factory buildings, and drying furnaces, etc.), eliminated the waste of working hours, and improved the operation methods. As a result, output increased by one-third.

　　The Sand Casting Workshop of Machine Factory No. 5 originally could only complete 30 spiral milling castings per month. In the new record movement in late October, it reorganized the labor force and used a three-ton large furnace instead of the previous one-ton small furnace. The workshop was leveled again, the working area was more than doubled, and electric lights were installed and the crane was repaired. After changing these conditions, they can guarantee to complete all the castings for 65 spiral milling machines in November, more than twice the past.

　　After the leaders of Benxi Coal Mine used the standard test method to create a new record for tunneling and promoted this experience, due to the increase in labor productivity, the original equipment could not fully utilize the role of the original labor force. The leadership also changed the production organization according to this new situation. As a result, not only were more than 100 workers transferred to work in limestone and silica mines, but also the output of coal increased from 2,300 tons per day to 3,000 tons.

　　At present, due to the continuous emergence of new records in various factories and mines, many unreasonable production organizations and unreasonable equipment utilization in the past have been particularly exposed, and the phenomenon of waiting for materials and wasting time is very common, which affects the workers' production morale. Without changing the status quo, it will not be possible to meet the requirements of the movement to create new production records, and production will stagnate. After studying the experiences of the Benxi and Machine Factory No. 5 foundries, the Ministry of Industry believes that this is a successful experience of creating new production records from the leadership and promoting new production records, and its basic spirit is suitable for all factories and mines.

　　Contact Contract is the Best Form of Combining Individual and Overall New Records

　　In order to overcome the phenomenon of disconnection caused by the unbalanced development of the new record movement among various groups, workshops, and types of work, and to overcome the phenomenon of having hundreds and thousands of new records but failing to complete and exceed the production plans and production tasks of the entire factory and mine, in addition to the leadership reallocating labor and equipment, the establishment of "contact contracts" between various related production groups, workshops, or types of work is the best form to overcome this phenomenon. The contact contract is the best form to organize various individual new records to complete a general goal - a general new record or production plan and production task. It is an effective method to overcome the disconnection between the new record movement and the production plan and production task. This method should be universally promoted from point to surface in all our factories and mines.

　　Fushun Victory Mine, Shenyang Woolen Mill, and Mechanical Third Factory in September have all tried contact contracts. It not only consolidated individual new records, but also promoted the improvement of overall productivity.

　　The signing of "contact contracts" should be led and targeted. Leading cadres should have careful consideration and research in advance, not blindly. The result of the convergence of several or many contact contracts can, on the one hand, consolidate the achievements of new records, and on the other hand, promote the emergence of new and more new records. Therefore, it often progresses from individual and partial new records to collective, full-workshop, and full-factory new records. This will smoothly complete or exceed production plans and production tasks, and achieve lower costs and higher quality. The signing of contact contracts must also be democratic. Contact contracts cannot be imposed on the masses. They must be discussed in detail and seriously by all employees of the group, team, or workshop that is signing the contract under the leadership. Every employee must think deeply and deliberate carefully. Solving problems by simply talking big with enthusiasm will not work. If the contract is only between the group leader, foreman, or director, the value will be very small, there will be no foundation, and the role of the contact contract will be reduced. Contact contracts are often proposed and organized by the leading organs in a timely manner under the following circumstances: that is, when a worker or a group of workers or a workshop has created a new record, and feels that the departments directly or indirectly related to this worker or group, workshop cannot cooperate with their new record production, so that this new record cannot be guaranteed (such as another department cannot supply him with what he needs), when it cannot be developed, the leadership should promptly, after deliberation, call on and organize various interconnected workshops and groups to sign contact contracts. This will encourage the backward to look up to the advanced, on the one hand, guaranteeing the original new record, and on the other hand, promoting the new records of its related departments.

　　The content of the contact contract should be proposed according to the different internal conditions of each factory and mine, and according to the requirements of the other party signing the contract. It cannot be generally stipulated. The requirements of open-hearth furnaces for blast furnaces and blast furnaces for coking furnaces are different; the requirements of mining workers for underground transport workers and underground transport workers for above-ground transport workers are different; the requirements of scribing workers for foundry workers and foundry workers for pattern makers are different; the requirements of lathe operators for planing operators and for milling operators are different; the requirements of this group for that group and that group for another group are different. In short, the content of the contract should be determined according to various specific requirements. Generally, it can include: quantity, quality, time, how to reward the contract being concluded, and how to handle the contract not being executed, etc.

　　The signing of contact contracts can more fully mobilize the masses, can drive the backward, can overcome weak departments, can link the entire production, can implement mass inspection. This is a very good form to combine the individual and the whole.

　　Signing a contact contract does not mean that it is all over after it is signed. There are still many problems and many difficulties in the implementation process, and many organizational works must be carried out to make the contract truly realized. Every production process of the product must be inspected and tested. The inspection organization should become an organization that actively improves quality and eliminates defective products, not waiting for the finished product to be bad before the inspection department (or section) knows about it. In connection with this, it is necessary to universally promote the responsibility system in all factories and mines, so that there is a special responsibility for everything, no matter how big or small, so that every employee can fully exert his or her talents and creativity in the work position he or she is responsible for. The leadership must especially help organizations or workshops with more difficulties, and find ways to solve the difficulties specifically, otherwise, one link lagging behind will affect the overall situation, and the entire plan falling through will affect the morale of employees. This is what leading cadres must be vigilant about in the universal promotion.

　　Technical Calibration and Reasonable Quotas

　　Adapting to the new situation, improving production organization, and establishing contact contracts cannot completely solve the problems that have been raised in the current leadership of the new record movement. It is also necessary to establish and improve a management system suitable for the new level of production. The first is to gradually determine reasonable quotas. Factories and mines where the new record movement has been carried out in a relatively thorough manner should gradually determine reasonable quotas. "After the enthusiasm of the masses has been mobilized, it is necessary to propose the formulation of reasonable technical quotas in a timely manner, such as product quality standards, working hours calibration, standards for the use of raw materials, fuel, water, and electricity... etc." (Instructions of the Ministry of Industry on Continuing to Implement the Economic Accounting System). Now, some factories or workshops or groups where the masses have been more fully mobilized should first determine the quotas in various aspects. With reasonable quotas, the leadership can also actively grasp the organization and planning of production, so as to further improve our wage system.

　　The determination of reasonable quotas should generally go through three steps: 1. Fully mobilize the masses to create new records in various aspects, establish a systematic and thorough statistical work, and organize cadres to conduct technical calibration on the spot. Leading cadres should also personally participate in the calibration in the main links, accurately measure the efficiency of machinery and equipment and labor efficiency, and test the standard dosage of various product quality and raw materials, as an important basis for determining reasonable quotas. When the movement develops to a certain stage, the factory management committee should study the quotas and determine to implement quota management in the most advanced groups or workshops. 2. Before deciding on various quotas, the results of the factory management committee's research should be handed over to that group for democratic discussion, and the trade union and branch should be used to mobilize and deliberate in advance to discuss whether the various quotas are reasonable, dispel the concerns of workers about the implementation of quota management, and make completing and exceeding quotas a conscious action of all workers. 3. After the relevant employees have discussed and the factory management committee has approved, the bureau (company) level will approve the implementation. The technical quotas for the entire factory and the entire company that will be implemented starting in January next year must be approved by the Ministry of Industry. This new technical quota approved by the Ministry of Industry should generally remain unchanged for half a year.

　　Finally, the Ministry of Industry believes that what must be emphasized by the responsible comrades of the industrial and mining industries at all levels is that the movement to create new production records is a long-term movement that guarantees the continued and continuous rise of industrial production. At present, it is only the beginning. Moreover, judging from the general laws of the development of the movement and the degree of awareness of the working masses at present, it is relatively easy to initially mobilize the working masses and break through the old production standards. However, it is more complex and detailed work to further thoroughly improve our production organization and production leadership, and to maintain the continuous improvement of all new records under the conditions of close coordination and close cooperation. In particular, because many of our cadres are laymen in leading and managing industry, the work is even more difficult. Therefore, we require everyone to face the difficulties squarely, work diligently, learn humbly, and study business. First of all, we require our leading cadres at all levels to study the problems raised by the current new record movement to the leadership, and thereby improve production management and create better conditions for the new record movement, and gradually become experts in the work. Only in this way can the development of the new record movement have unlimited broad prospects.

　　东北工业部颁布指示
  　普遍订立联系合同逐渐确定合理定额
    进一步组织和推广新纪录运动
    东北工业部顷发布关于进一步组织和推广新纪录运动的指示，原文如下：
    创造新纪录运动在各厂矿获得了很大成绩，同时提出了和暴露了一系列必须迅予解决的问题，其中主要的是领导上如何配合群众运动创造集体的新纪录。也就是说新纪录运动经过两个多月的发展，它一方面创造了巨大的成绩，表现了工人阶级无比的智慧，另一方面它又给所有企业的领导干部提出了一个新的问题。
    由于运动发展的不平衡，特别是由于许多厂矿在生产组织、和领导方面落后于运动的发展，因此便产生整个生产过程不相适应，和不能配合的现象。如这部分小组是新纪录，那部分小组是老一套，彼此脱节；工人的新纪录不断出现，而生产组织，物资供应方面还是依然如故，配合不上；一方面在叫机器少设备不够，而另一方面却有大量机器和设备不去利用。在同一个厂这部分工人很紧张，另一部分工人空闲着没有工作等等。
    所有这些，说明目前新纪录运动向我们各级领导机关提出了一系列新的问题，需要领导上给以恰当的及时的解决。因为显然的，各地厂矿在新纪录广泛的发展过程中，有的已经遇到有的将要遇到以上这些问题的障碍。如不及时解决，生气勃勃的新纪录运动将不可能继续顺利发展，或者成千成百的新纪录得不到它的成果，甚至由于领导上不能很好组织而形成新的不合理现象。这就是说，新纪录运动现在向领导机关提出了这样的问题：要按照新的情况来计划生产；按照新的情况来组织和配备劳务力；按照新的情况来组织原材料的供应；按照新的情况来利用和调整机械设备；按照新的情况来改进劳动条件；按照新的情况来配备干部；按照新的情况来改进工作制度与工作方法……等等。总之，目前光是要工人来创造新纪录是不够了，这些问题必须从领导上来解决。要从领导上来改进我们的生产组织与管理制度，并在运动过程中把工厂管理委员会健全起来，创造领导上的新纪录，才能推进运动，才能进一步使运动深入和广泛；才能把一切个别的新纪录组织成为一个整体；才能够保证完成并大大的超过生产计划和生产任务。主动的具体的解决这些问题，就是站在运动的前面指导运动，这些问题不解决是妨碍着运动的开展和生产效率的提高的。
    改变劳动组织与调剂设备的运用
    在两个多月的运动中，总结有以下一些经验。
    本溪铸造场在创造新纪录运动中发现了劳动力组织不合理，吊车、干燥炉、厂房有时闲着无工作，有时大家则都用，不够用就等着，浪费工时很多。领导上为了克服这种现象，接受了苏联专家的建议，和老工人商量，改变了劳动组织和操作方法，过去三天开一火改为两天开一火，调剂了设备（吊车、厂房与干燥炉等）的运用，消灭了浪费工时，改进了操作方法，结果产量提高了三分之一。
    机器五厂翻砂场，原来每月只能完成三十台螺旋铣铸件，十月下旬在新纪录运动中，重新组织了劳动力，不用过去一吨的小炉，改用三吨的大炉。重新整平了场房，工作面积扩大了一倍以上，并按了电灯修理了吊车，改变了这些条件以后，他们在十一月份可保证完成六十五台螺旋铣全部铸件，超过过去两倍以上。
    本溪煤矿领导上用标准试验的方法，创造了掘进的新纪录并推广了这一经验以后，由于劳动生产率的提高，原有的设备不能充分发挥原有劳动力的作用，领导上又根据这种新的情况，改变了生产组织，结果不仅调出了一百多名工人转到了石灰石和硅石矿工作，而且煤的产量由每日二千三百吨提高到三千吨。
    目前各厂矿由于新纪录不断出现，就特别暴露了过去许多生产组织的不合理，设备的运用不合理，并由此而产生停工待料的浪费现象很普遍，影响了工人的生产情绪。不改变现状，就不能满足创造生产新纪录运动的要求，就会使生产停滞不前。工业部研究了本溪与机器五厂铸造场的经验，认为这是成功的从领导上创造生产新纪录，促进生产新纪录的经验，其基本精神适合于一切厂矿。
    联系合同是个别与整体新纪录结合的最好形式
    克服新纪录运动在各个小组、车间、工种之间发展不平衡而造成的脱节现象，克服有了成百成千新纪录而不能完成和超过全厂矿生产计划与生产任务的现象，除了领导上重新配备劳动力和设备以外，各个联系的生产小组、车间、或各个工种间订立“联系合同”是克服这种现象的最好形式。联系合同是把各个单独的新纪录加以组织，完成一个总目标——总的新纪录或生产计划与生产任务的最好的形式，是克服新纪录运动与生产计划及生产任务脱节的有效方法，这个方法应该在我们一切厂矿由点到面普遍推行。
    抚顺胜利矿、沈阳毛织厂及九月份机械第三厂，均试行了联系合同，它不仅巩固了个别新纪录，并推动了总的生产率的提高。
    订立“联系合同”应该是有领导的、有目标的。领导干部事先要有周密考虑和研究，不是盲目的，几个或很多联系合同汇合的结果一方面可以巩固新纪录的成果，另一方面又会促进新的更多的新纪录的产生，因而也就常常由个人的、部分的新纪录进到集体的、全车间、全厂的新纪录。由此而顺利的完成或超过生产计划与生产任务，并且达到降低成本与提高质量。订立联系合同又必须是民主的，联系合同不能强加于群众，必须有领导的经过订立合同的小组、班或车间全体职工详细的、认真的讨论，使每个职工深思熟虑、经过酝酿，单凭热情说大话是解决不了问题的。如果合同仅仅是组长、工长或主任之间的，价值就很小，就没有基础，就降低了联系合同的作用。联系合同常常是在这样情况之下应为领导机关及时的提出并加以组织：即当一个工人或一个小组一个车间创造了新的纪录之后，感到与这一工人或小组、车间直接间接联系的部门不能与其新纪录的生产相配合，因而使这一新纪录不能保证（如另一部门不能供给他需要的东西），不能发展时，领导上即应及时的经过酝酿，号召与组织各个相互联系的车间、小组订立联系合同。这样就会把落后的提起向先进的看齐，一则保证了原有的新纪录，一则又促进了与其联系部门的新纪录。
    联系合同的内容，应该根据各个不同厂矿内部的不同情况，根据订立合同的对方要求提出，不能一般规定。平炉对高炉与高炉对炼焦炉的要求不同；采掘工对坑内运输工与坑内运输工对坑外运输工的要求不同；划线工对铸工与铸工对模型工要求不同；车工对刨工与对铣工的要求不同；这个小组对那个小组与那个小组对另外一个小组要求不同。总之要根据各种具体不同要求来确定合同的内容。大体上可以包括：数量、质量、时间、订成合同如何奖励及不执行合同如何办等。
    订立联系合同能够更充分的发动群众，能够带动落后，能够克服薄弱部门，能够把整个生产联结起来，能够实行群众性检查，这是一个很好的把个别与整体结合起来的形式。
    订立了联系合同，并不是订立了就完事大吉的，在执行中还有很多问题很多困难，还要进行许多组织工作使合同能真正实现。产品的每一个生产过程都必须进行检查和试验。检查组织应该成为积极的提高质量消灭废品的组织，不是等成品坏了检查科（或股）才知道。与此相连系的要在一切厂矿里普遍推行负责制，做到事无大小，各有专责，使每一个职工，都能够在自己所负责的工作岗位上，充分的发挥其才能和创造，领导上特别要帮助困难较多的组织或车间，想办法具体解决困难，否则一环落后，就会影响全局，整个计划落空就会影响职工情绪，这是在普遍推行中领导干部必须警惕的。
    技术的标定与合理定额
    适应新的情况改进生产组织与建立联系合同，还不能全部解决目前领导新纪录运动中已被提出的问题。还必须要建立和健全适合于新的生产水平的管理制度。首先就是逐渐确定合理的定额。新纪录运动开展得比较深入的厂矿，即应逐渐确定合理的定额，“当群众的积极性已经发动后，必须适时的提出规定合理的技术定额，如产品的质量标准，工时的标定，原料、燃料及水、电使用的标准……等等”（工业部关于继续贯彻经济核算制的指示），现在有些群众已经比较充分发动的厂或车间或小组，即应首先确定各方面的定额。有了合理的定额，使领导上又能够主动的掌握生产的组织性和计划性，以便于进一步改进我们的工资制度。
    合理定额的确定，一般的应经过三个步骤：一、充分的发动群众创造各方面的新纪录，建立系统周密的统计工作，并组织干部到现场进行技术标定，领导干部也要在主要环节上亲自参加标定，准确的测定机器设备的效率和劳动效率，试验各种产品质量和原材料的标准用量，以作为确定合理定额的重要依据，运动发展到一定阶段，工厂管理委员会即应研究定额，确定在最先进的小组或车间实行定额管理。二、在决定各种定额之前，应将工厂管理委员会研究的结果，交给那个小组民主讨论，并事先经过工会与支部酝酿动员，讨论各种定额是否合理，打消工友对实行定额管理的顾虑，使完成与超过定额成为全体工友自觉的行动。三、经过有关职工讨论工厂管理委员会通过以后，再由局（公司）一级批准实行。明年一月开始实行的全厂全公司的技术定额，最后需经工业部批准，经工业部批准的这一新的技术定额，一般的应该是半年不变动。
    最后，工业部认为，必须引起各级工矿负责同志着重注意的，就是创造生产新纪录运动是长期的，保证工业生产继续不断高涨的运动，目前仅仅是开始，而且根据运动发展的一般规律和目前工人群众觉悟的程度来看，初步的把工人群众发动起来，突破旧的生产标准，还是比较容易的，而进一步彻底改善我们的生产组织和生产领导，使所有的新纪录在互相衔接密切配合的条件下保持经常不断的提高，则是比较更为复杂和细致的工作。特别是由于我们很多干部，对领导和管理工业都是外行，工作更有困难，因此要求大家必须正视困难，兢兢业业，虚心学习，钻研业务，首先要求我们各级领导干部，把现在新纪录运动向领导提出的问题加以钻研，并由此改善生产管理，给新纪录运动创造更好的条件，逐渐使自己成为工作内行。只有这样，新纪录运动的发展才有无限广阔的前途。
