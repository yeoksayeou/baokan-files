Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 9th: TASS Moscow dispatch: *Pravda*'s special correspondent in Sofia, Grubov, reports on the trial of traitor Kostov and others in Bulgaria, saying: On the 7th, the courtroom was packed with representatives from factories, villages, Party organizations, state and public organizations of the capital, who watched the trial intently and listened to every word of the indictment. The people in the courtroom were thinking about what their fate would have been if the criminal plan of Kostov and his accomplices had succeeded.

On the afternoon of the 7th, the chief spy Kostov was tried. He was short, fat, and clean-shaven, with cunning eyes hidden behind horn-rimmed glasses. He approached the podium and began to make sweet and ingratiating statements. From the first word of his confession, it was clear that he was an old and cunning traitor. He tried every means to confuse the court, divert it from the main issues, and avoid being struck. While admitting small details in his confused confession, Kostov tried to cover up his criminal traces and denied many things. He admitted that he had supported and participated in the Trotskyist group of left-leaning sectarianism within the Bulgarian Communist Party. When asked if he had any connections with British and Yugoslav intelligence agencies, and whether he was prepared to incorporate Bulgaria into Tito's Yugoslavia, Kostov avoided direct answers. He admitted that he had met with British Colonel Byre, but said they were just "friends meeting together for a cup of tea." Kostov's arrogance, stupidity and evasiveness, and his efforts to dilute the evidence presented during the preliminary investigation, aroused the indignation of the people present at the hearing. However, due to the conclusive evidence, Kostov was forced to admit his criminal acts. He had tried every means to oppose Soviet-Bulgarian friendship, had hindered the country's progress towards socialism, and had carried out Tito's and his masters' insidious plans for the Balkans.

The next to be tried was former Finance Minister Stefanov. Stefanov described his antagonistic activities in a slanderous and critical tone. These activities ranged from when he met his relative Rakovsky in Berlin in 1924 to when he worked for British intelligence. His confession exposed Kostov's false evasions, and he described Kostov as the head and organizer of a gang of murderers and spies.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 8th: TASS Sofia dispatch: Bulgarian newspapers continue to publish commentaries on the indictment of Kostov's treason case.

The Communist Party organ *Workers' Cause* published an editorial entitled "Conspiracy Against National Independence," stating: The indictment in the Kostov case proves that these criminals colluded with the rebellious Tito group from the time the Trotskyites in the Soviet Union committed treason. Kostov had connections with some organizers of the Soviet Trotskyist counter-revolutionary conspiracy, and Tito also received from them hatred for the great socialist country and the great party of Lenin and Stalin. Kostov and Tito made their acquaintance at that time and helped Tito climb to the leadership of the Yugoslav Communist Party, helping him to engage in his rebellious career there.

The Bulgarian Anti-Fascist Fighters Alliance organ *Battle* published an editorial stating: "In the history of our people, there has never been a more serious crime than the conspiracy committed against our country by the fascist bandit Kostov and his gang, with the help of the Tito group's worldwide opposition. Our people urgently demand that they be severely punished so that our country can forever be freed from the magical realm prepared by these spies and traitors.

　　真理报记者报导
  　审讯科斯托夫叛国案
  　保报著论要求严惩卖国贼
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报索非亚特派员格鲁伯夫报道保加利亚审讯叛国犯科斯托夫等的情形称：七日，法庭上挤满了首都各工厂、乡村、党、国家与公众组织的代表，他们深切地注视着审讯的情形，倾听起诉书的每一个字，法庭的人们都想着假如科斯托夫及其同谋犯的犯罪计划成功的话，他们的命运将会怎样。
    七日午后审讯奸细头子科斯托夫，他身材矮小、肥胖、胡子刮得很光，狡诈的眼睛藏在角质边眼镜的后面。他走近讲台并开始甜言密语地申述。从他供词的第一个字起，就清楚显露出他是一个老奸巨滑的卖国贼。他企图用一切方法使法庭混乱，使法庭离开主要问题，并使他自己免遭打击。科斯托夫在混乱的口供中虽然承认小的细节，但却力图掩饰他的犯罪痕迹，并否认许多事情。他承认他曾支持和参加过保加利亚共产党内的左倾宗派主义的托洛茨基集团。在问他是否曾与英国及南斯拉夫谍报机关有联系，是否准备将保加利亚并入铁托的南斯拉夫时，科斯托夫避免直接回答。他承认他曾与英国的拜雷上校会晤，但说他们只是“朋友相会在一起喝一杯茶”。科斯托夫骄横、愚蠢地遁辞，和他企图冲淡初步侦讯时提出之证据的努力，引起了到庭旁听的人们的愤慨。但是，由于证据确凿，科斯托夫被迫承认他的罪犯行为。他曾千方百计反对苏保友谊，曾经阻碍国家向社会主义前进，曾经执行铁托及其主子对巴尔干的阴险计划。
    次一被审讯的是前财长斯捷法诺夫。斯捷法诺夫用诽谤性的批评口吻描写他的敌对活动。这些活动从一九二四年他在柏林见到他的亲戚拉科夫斯基时起，到他为英国谍报机关工作时为止。他的供词揭露了科斯托夫的虚假遁词，他形容科斯托夫是杀人犯与间谍匪帮的头子和组织者。
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚报纸继续发表对科斯托夫叛国案起诉书的评论。
    共产党机关报工人事业报以“反对民族独立的阴谋”为题发表社论称：科斯托夫一案的起诉书，证明这些罪犯们从苏联托洛茨基分子谋叛的时候起，即已和叛逆的铁托集团勾结上了。科斯托夫与苏联托派反革命阴谋的某些组织者有联系，铁托也从他们那里得到了对伟大的社会主义国家和伟大的列宁与斯大林党的憎恨，科斯托夫和铁托就在那时订交，并且帮助铁托爬到南斯拉夫共产党的领导地位，帮助他在那里从事他的叛逆事业。
    保加利亚反法西斯战士联盟机关报“战斗”报发表社论称：“在我国人民的历史上，从没见过比法西斯匪帮科斯托夫一伙在铁托集团的全世界反对派的帮助下对我国进行的阴谋更严重的罪行了。我国人民迫切要求给他们严厉的惩罚，俾使我们的国家永远摆脱这些间谍和卖国贼所准备好了的魔境。
