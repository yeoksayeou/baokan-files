 　 Forty-seven Obstruction

    The next day, the cadres reported the opinions of each group's discussion, which poured a bucket of cold water on Lao Yin's excitement.

    There weren't many opinions about land distribution and class designation; but when it came to opening the kiln, no one said anything, and they all remained silent as if they had encountered a task that couldn't be done in the past. After a long time, Shuan Cheng said, "Our group finally managed to get everyone to agree to use cash to start the kiln, but they weren't willing to take it all out, and wanted to keep some for the New Year; I had to talk until my lips were chapped!" Little Foreign Devil continued, "Maybe I'm a bit better at telling jokes than Shuan Cheng; but when it comes to work, I'm useless. I talked until my throat was so dry that the sky turned red and the earth cracked, but people didn't object to opening the kiln, they just weren't willing to take out cash! Sigh, there were so many words! What about writing an IOU to guarantee no compensation, and even if I wrote an IOU, it wouldn't be enough, because they were afraid that even if I killed my whole family and sold the meat, I wouldn't be able to afford so much compensation! In the past, Lao Yin always helped me with meetings, but this time he didn't go! People also said: the cash is waiting to be eaten, and the year is not strong! Those kiln workers who have other jobs said: I'll only do it if I make a profit and don't lose money..." Lao Yin hurriedly asked everyone: "Then didn't people say what to do to support the kiln?" Little Foreign Devil said, "They said to ask the public for a loan!" People couldn't help but laugh reluctantly. Liu Goujia and Bai Quanjia, as in the past, opened their mouths with their hands clasped together, "Our women all said that they don't know anything about kilns, so let the men handle it! But when people heard that it would cost so much, they were terribly afraid." After a pause, the two remembered something, but Bai Quanjia didn't say it, so Liu Goujia said, "If you don't say it, I'll say it. People are afraid that Da San will offend the Old Lord again, and the kiln won't be started, but the whole village will be flooded again." Shuan Cheng hurriedly told everyone not to say those useless things and to discuss it properly; only then did he realize that only his group was willing to take out some cash, Little Foreign Devil's group wasn't taking any out, Tian Lu and the women's groups were just following what others did, and Bian Xiao's group, he said, "Our group all agreed to fix up the big kiln, but didn't agree to turn the kiln into a joint effort for the whole village, but to let those who are willing to do it join in, and those who don't have any capital can join with their labor, and the village can lend some cash. That's it!" People all clamored for a while, "This method is not bad." Lao Yin said, "Why is it that in our world, people are afraid of failing? Besides, Da San has already taken hold of sixty or seventy percent of the bottom line!" The meeting started to become chaotic. Lao Yin quietly said to Shuan Cheng, "This is all because we were too hasty and didn't let the poor peasant association communicate properly beforehand. Let's organize again later!" Shuan Cheng said, "I guess someone is leading the way in spreading rumors." Lao Yin said, "We'll talk about that later! But what do you think of Bian Xiao's method? I'm just afraid that it won't work well that way, and no one will participate. You take charge of the arrangement!" Shuan Cheng went to various parts of the meeting place to listen to opinions, and finally, based on everyone's clamoring, he told them to first find workers and poor peasants to communicate with, and then bring the opinions of each group down for discussion at night; in the end, Lao Yin said a paragraph, asking everyone to patiently explain: the village can't turn over if it doesn't start the kiln, and he continued to arrange for land distribution and class designation, and people were somewhat more lively than when they came, and then they dispersed.

    Shuan Cheng and Bian Xiao stayed behind at the temple, messing around with Lao Yin: trying to find out who exactly was spreading rumors; after a while, Da San rushed in "thump, thump, thump", he said, "Lao Yin, I have 70% of the bottom line for starting the kiln, but that's what I said to you, I didn't say it to everyone in the village. People are saying this and that, I think we don't have to do it, who can write a guarantee, let them do it!" Everyone hurriedly persuaded him, and he said, "I think those who say those inhuman things must be instigated! It can't be separated from that bunch of traitors! If we don't punish them again, our village's kiln will definitely not be started." Lao Yin said, "Look at you, you're so impatient again, sigh!" He was very afraid that something would happen again, so he quickly arranged for Shuan Cheng and Bian Xiao to calm him down, and then pulled Da San out, slowly persuading him to leave.

    Forty-eight Smooth

    It turned out that the one who took the lead in spreading rumors about borrowing cash was Tai Cheng. He had been criticized for eating ash food in the spring when he started the kiln, and now he saw that the big kiln was going to be managed by the whole village, so wouldn't the work he found for finding water in the West Kiln be wasted? Therefore, he had never been enthusiastic about fixing up the big kiln; at the same time, he had always had an opinion about being classified as a middle peasant during the class designation in the past, and receiving less fruit and grain, and he had always wanted to make trouble, but Shuan Cheng figured out and investigated these things; so after Lao Yin persuaded Da San to stop, he went to find Tai Cheng. Tai Cheng treated Lao Yin naturally differently, and when he heard Lao Yin directly say that it was wrong to misclassify his class designation, and praised his skills, asking him to put more effort into starting the kiln, he panicked and went along with the flow, saying, "Lao Yin, when you talk about those rumors about starting the kiln, I was just joking; you know Little Foreign Devil, we can't help but joke when we meet." Lao Yin said, "Then that's it! But it's just that..." Tai Cheng hurriedly said, "Old Yin, let me be frank and admit my mistake!" After a pause, he quietly told Lao Yin: "Besides Da San who can take out 70% of the bottom line for this kiln, our skills are not strong enough, it won't work." Then he said a lot about the shortcomings of the kiln, and said: "That year I started the West Kiln, Da San came back from the Fourth Mine and told Yu Bao that we could only dig to the northwest, but later the water came out exactly from the northwest wall." Lao Yin was somewhat moved, but he only arranged for him to worry more and think more, and then discussed these words with Da San; Da San explained one by one that they were not in the way, and told Lao Yin: that year, when the West Kiln was flooded, he had not dug so deep when he inspected it, so he didn't see the water in the northwest wall; Lao Yin then went to various places to visit and mess around with peace of mind.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（５１）
    康濯
  　四十七　阻碍
    第二天，干部们汇报各小组讨论的意见，却给老尹的高兴劲头泼了瓢凉水。
    分地和成分的事，倒没多的意见：但说到开窑，却谁也不言声，都象往日碰到没法办的工作那样呆着。老大一会，拴成才说：“咱那组总算是好说赖说通过了拿现洋大伙闹窑，可也不乐意都拿，都想留两个过年；这还是我说烂了嘴唇哩！”小洋鬼接着道：“咱这嘴要说个耍笑话嘛，许比拴成强点；可说工作就不顶球用。我他妈嗓子说得天红地旱那么干，人们开窑倒没意见，就是不肯拿现洋！唉，话多哩！什么叫我写字据保险不赔啦，又说写字据也不顶，怕把我一家子杀了卖肉也赔不起那么些！往日总是老尹帮我开会的，可这回碰对他又没去！人们还说：现洋等着吃哩，年景不强的！有那些有营生干的窑黑们又说：“光挣不赔他才干……”老尹忙问大伙：“那人们没说使什么抬掇窑？”小洋鬼道：“说是叫公家借！”人们不禁都勉强地笑起来。柳沟家和白泉家又象往日一样，一开口就两个手拉手一道说：“咱妇女们都说对窑不摸门，汉汉们看着办吧！可人们一听要花那么些，都怕的不行。”停了停，二人又想起件事，白泉家却不说，柳沟家道：“你不说我说。人说是不怕把现洋都填了水窟窿么？”小洋鬼说：“咱那组也说这来着。什么光现洋往水窟窿扔吧，还听个响声哩！可这费那些工夫的，连个响声也听不上。”扁小说：“这会反正谁有嘴谁也敢瞎说，听那些哩！说正经的吧！”柳沟家却又想起个事，硬叫白泉家说，白泉家红着脸道：“说就说呗！人们还怕大三又得罪了老君父，可窑没闹成，倒把浑村又淹了。”拴成忙叫大家甭说那些不顶用的，好好讨论；这才看到：五个组只他这个乐意拿点现洋，小洋鬼那是不拿，天禄和妇女们的是看人家怎么就怎么，扁小这小组，他说：“咱这都同意拾掇大窑，可不赞成把窑闹成浑村大伙的，要让乐意闹的碰股闹，没垫本就入身股，村里现洋借给点。就这！”人们一时都咯嚷道：“这办法倒不赖。”老尹说：“怎么这会咱们的天下，人们倒都怕闹不成呀？再说大三也拿住了六七成底底的！”会上杂七杂八地咯吵开了。老尹又悄悄对拴成说：“这只怪咱们太急，事先没让贫农团好好串通，下去再组织组织吧！”拴成道：“说怪话这事，我猜摸准有人挑头。”老尹说：“这回头再说吧！可你看扁小那办法怎么样？我只怕那么着闹不好，没有参加。你张罗着布置吧！”拴成就钻到会厂各处听意见，最后便根据大伙咯嚷的，让下去后先找工人贫农串通，黑夜把各组的意见带下去再讨论；末了，老尹又说了一段话，叫大家耐心解说：村里不闹窑就翻不了身，并又继续布置了分地和检查成分的事，人们比来的时候总算多少活跳了些，散了。
    庙上留下了拴成扁小们，在跟老尹捣拉：看说怪话的到底是些谁们；不一会，大三却“通通通”地直冲冲进来了，他说：“老尹，我这闹窑有七成底底，可是对你说的，我没跟浑村大伙说。人们说这说那的，我看咱不干也行，谁能写包票，谁来干！”大家忙紧着劝说他，他又道：“我看他妈说那不是人话的，准有人挑逗！反正离不了那窝子汉奸们！要不再治治他们，咱村这窑准没闹。”老尹道：“你看你又这么急性，唉！”他很怕又出事，忙安插了拴成扁小一顿，就拉着大三出去，慢慢打劝他去。
    四十八　顺利
    却说为借现洋的事挑头说怪话的是泰成。他春起闹窑吃灰食受过批评，这阵子又见要把大窑给浑村管，那他西窑找水的工不是得白丢了？因此他对拾掇大窑一直劲头不大；同时过去划成分把他划成了个中农，分果实少分了点粮食，他一直有意见，老想闹个蹩扭，但他这些事，拴成一思谋一调查就闹清了；于是老尹把大三劝说停当以后，就去寻泰成。泰成待老尹自然不同，又见老尹直说过划错了他的成分实是不对，并一个劲夸说他的手艺，要他闹窑多出力，他就心慌慌地顺水行船道：“老尹，你说起那些个讨论闹窑的怪话，我原也是耍耍笑笑说的；你知道小洋鬼那人，咱们一见面就离不了个耍笑。”老尹道：“那说了就算了！不过是……”泰成忙道：“黑家我坦白坦白，认个错吧！”停了停，他又悄悄告老尹：“这窑除了大三能拿个七成底底，咱把式不强，不行。”接着他把窑里怎长短的毛病说了一堆，并道：“我那年闹西窑，大三从四矿回来告玉宝，说是只能往西北刨，可后来出水倒正是西北墙出来的。”老尹多少动了动心，但也只安插了叫他多操心多想法，回头并把这些话跟大三研究；大三一一解说了都不碍事，又告老尹：那年西窑水淹的事，是他察看那会，还没刨那么深，因此才没看出西北墙有水；老尹便又放心地上各处串游捣拉去了。
