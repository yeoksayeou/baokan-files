Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 18th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram on the 16th to congratulate Marshal Stalin on his 70th birthday. The telegram reads as follows:

Respected Comrade Stalin:

On the occasion of your 70th birthday, a festival for the working class and all oppressed people around the world, we, on behalf of the working class of the People's Republic of China, extend to you—the great leader and teacher of the world proletariat—our highest respects and warm congratulations!

You are the banner of the victorious struggle for the liberation of the world proletariat and working people. Thanks to your wise leadership, the glorious socialist country of the Soviet Union has been established and consolidated—laying a solid foundation and opening up a broad road to liberation for the liberation of the world proletariat and oppressed nations. The victory of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people today is inseparable from the spiritual and material assistance given to us by the Soviet revolution, especially from your deep concern and wise instructions for the Chinese working class and the Chinese people! In the future, we must work with great enthusiasm to learn from the great nation-building experience accumulated by the Soviet working brothers under your leadership, unite the entire Chinese people to fight for the construction of a democratic and happy New China, and fight for lasting world peace and people's democracy! In order to answer your—the great friend and mentor of the Chinese people—encouragement and help to us.

Respectfully wishing you longevity!

　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions
