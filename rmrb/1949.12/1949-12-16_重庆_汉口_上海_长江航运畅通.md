Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, December 14th. Following the liberation of Wanxian, the Yangtze River waterway between Hankou and Chongqing in the upper reaches of the Yangtze resumed navigation on the 11th. Now, the entire Yangtze River waterway, stretching over 2,000 kilometers from Chongqing in the west to Shanghai in the east, is open and unobstructed. The channel equipment between Yichang and Chongqing was not significantly damaged before liberation, and Chongqing shipping vessels can directly reach Shanghai. However, due to the swift currents in the Yichang-Chongqing section at present, ordinary shipping vessels are not suitable for navigation. When going upstream from Shanghai and other places, it is necessary to change vessels in Yichang. Hankou has dispatched experienced navigators and pilots to Yichang and Badong to prepare to receive Chongqing ships coming to Hankou. After the resumption of navigation on the Sichuan River, ships sailing downstream from Chongqing include: the Minsheng Company's "Minzu" and "Minlian" vessels (which set sail from Chongqing on the 11th, carrying tung oil, pickled mustard tubers, and other Sichuan native products) and the Qianghua Company's "Huayuan" vessel (which set sail from Chongqing on the 11th). The Minsheng and Qianghua branch offices here, as well as the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, will also dispatch vessels upstream soon.

　　重庆——汉口——上海
  　长江航运畅通
    【新华社汉口十四日电】万县解放后，长江上游汉口至重庆间，已于十一日开始恢复通航。现西起重庆，东到上海二千余公里的长江航线已畅通无阻。宜（昌）渝间航道设备解放前未受重大破坏，重庆航轮可直达上海；惟因宜（昌）渝间目下江流湍急，普通航轮不宜行驶，由上海等地在上溯时，则须在宜昌换轮。汉口方面已派有领江、引水多人宜昌、巴东、准备接引渝船来汉。川江恢复通航后，由渝下驶轮船，计有：民生公司的“民族”“民联”两轮（十一日在渝启碇，载有桐油、榨菜等四川土产）和强华公司的“华源”轮（十一日在渝启碇）此间民生、强华分公司和国营招商局，最近也将派轮上驶。
