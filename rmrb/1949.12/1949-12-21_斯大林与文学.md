　　Stalin and Literature
  　　　　　(I)
    Mao Dun
    "National in form, socialist in content" is Stalin's most correct instruction on literature and art. Under this guiding principle, Soviet literature and art has achieved brilliant accomplishments of various styles. This is particularly evident in the rapid development of Soviet minority ethnic literatures and arts in the past three decades. Among the winners of the annual Stalin Literature and Art Prize are artists from Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and other ethnic groups. The form of their works is national—preserving and developing the excellent styles and traditions of their respective national literatures and arts, as well as the characteristics of their national literary languages. And the content is socialist—like the literary and artistic works of their brotherly nationalities, they express and reflect socialist construction, the noble qualities of the Soviet people, and the spirit of patriotism and internationalism. The guiding principle of "national in form, socialist in content" should be "applicable to all corners of the world."

    More than twenty years ago, in September 1927, when Stalin answered the first American workers' delegation's question about what a communist society would be like, he said: "Communist society will be a society... (6) where science and art will have fully developed and favorable conditions, so as to achieve full prosperity."
    Facts have confirmed Stalin's words. Today's Soviet literature and art already has fully developed and favorable conditions. It is already blooming brilliantly, and it will become even more magnificent and reach a peak of prosperity. This is inseparable from Stalin's overall wise leadership, especially his constant concern, instruction, and criticism of literature and art.
    Stalin himself, his lifelong career, his steely will, his crystal-clear mind, his infinite loyalty to the Party and the people... In a word, his supreme personality is the inspirer and inspiration for poets, writers, and artists to devote themselves to creation. At the same time, his individual and specific instructions on literature and art are so capable of arousing creators' deep thought and further progress and greater effort—this makes us have to call him a great literary theorist and critic at the same time.
    "Writers are engineers of the human soul." -- Any writer who hears this title from Stalin, in addition to feeling honored, can they not think that their responsibility is really very important? ...
    "Socialist realism." -- This not only pinpointed the problem and solved many disputes about literary creation and criticism methods that were either rightist or "leftist," but, more importantly, did it not give thousands upon thousands of writers an infinitely bright and infinitely promising future and vision? Did it not give thousands upon thousands of writers the path to let go of their creativity and fully develop their talents and skills? (I say thousands upon thousands of writers because this title and this method of creation and criticism are not only limited to Soviet writers who should and are willing to follow).
    With just these two points, plus the one that "the content is socialist and proletarian, and the form is national," Stalin's contribution to the progressive culture and literature and art of the world is already very, very great.
    Long live the greatest engineer of the human soul, the first socialist realist, the teacher and leader of the proletariat of the world and the people of all nations -- the wise and great Stalin! Long live! Long, long live!!!

　　斯大林与文学
  　　　　　（一）
    茅盾
    “民族的形式，社会主义的内容”，这是斯大林在文艺上最正确的指示。苏联文艺在这指导原则之下，获得了多采的具有各种各样风格的辉煌的成就。这特别表现在苏联各少数民族文艺近三十年来的飞跃发展上。每年一度的斯大林文艺奖的获得者，其中就有乌克兰、白俄罗斯、乔治亚、阿尔美尼亚、阿塞尔拜疆、乌兹别克，哈萨克等等民族的文艺家；他们的作品的形式是民族的，——保持并发展了各自民族文艺上优良的风格和传统，以及民族的文学语言的特点等等，而内容则是社会主义的，——和他们的兄弟民族的文艺作品一样表现并反映了社会主义的建设、苏维埃人民崇高的品质，爱国主义和国际主义的精神。“民族的形式、社会主义的内容”这一指导原则，应该是“放诸四海而皆准”的。

    还是二十多年以前，二七年九月斯大林答复第一次美国工人代表团关于共产主义社会将会是什么情形的问题时就说过：“共产主义社会将是那样的社会……（六）在那里，科学与艺术将得到充分发展的顺利的条件，以至于可以达到充分的全盛的繁荣”。
    事实证实了斯大林的话。苏联今天的文艺已具有充分发展的顺利条件，已经是光辉灿烂地开花，而且还会更加辉煌地达到全盛的繁荣境界。这和斯大林整个英明的领导，特别和他对文学艺术的经常关怀、指示、批评是分不开的。
    斯大林本身，他一生的事业，钢铁般的意志，水晶般的头脑，对党对人民的无限忠心……一句话，他的至高无上的人格，就是启发诗人作家艺术家舍身创作的鼓舞者，灵感人。但同时他对文艺的个别具体指示又是那样能够引起创作者的深思而更加前进，更加努力，——这使得我们不能不称他同时是伟大的文艺理论家、批评家。
    “作家是人类心灵底工程师”。——任何作家听了斯大林这个封号，除了觉得光荣之外，能够不想到自己的责任实在重大非常吗？……
    “社会主义的现实主义”。——这不但一针见血，解决了许多或右或“左”的关于文艺创作与批评方法的纠纷，而且，主要的，不是给了成千成万的作家们一个无限光明的无限前途与远景吗？不是给了成千成万的作家们放手创作，尽量发挥自己的才能与技巧的道路吗？（我说成千成万的作家是因为这个称号与这个创作与批评方法，不仅只限于苏联的作家所应该和愿意遵循的）。
    只这两条，再加上“内容是社会主义的，无产阶级的，形式是民族的”一条，斯大林对全世界进步文化与文艺的贡献，已经是非常非常之伟大了。
    人类心灵最伟大的工程师、第一个社会主义的现实主义者、全世界无产阶级和全世界各民族人民底导师、领袖——英明伟大的斯大林万岁！万岁！万万岁！！！
