Where Should Beijing's Weaving and Dyeing Industry Go?
　　Feng Zhong The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference proposes in its section on industry that the textile industry and other light industries beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood should be restored and increased. The total number of machine spindles in China is less than five million (half of which are concentrated in Shanghai), which is about one-seventh of India's thirty-five million spindles. Considering the clothing needs of the country's 475 million people, 50 million spindles are needed to adequately supply them; however, the current total in the country (including the areas to be liberated) is less than one-tenth of this, and the number of spindles in the Tianjin-Beijing and North China liberated areas is only 150,000. In the future, on the principle of not relying on outsiders and striving for self-sufficiency, the textile and dyeing industry has great prospects for development and must be developed in order to meet the daily clothing consumption needs of the broad masses of the people. Of course, our goal is to develop new-style electric weaving, but it will not be possible to fully adopt automatic electric weaving until the national industry is fully restored. Under these circumstances, the existing old-fashioned looms in large and medium-sized cities still need to maintain their production. During the long War of Resistance Against Japan and the anti-Chiang war, the people's purchasing power has generally dropped to the lowest level due to the unscrupulous exploitation of cities and villages by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits, thus forming the current phenomenon of sluggish sales. However, this does not indicate an oversupply of weaving production. This phenomenon will disappear with the liberation of the whole country, the increasing development of the New Democratic economy, and the gradual increase in people's purchasing power.
　　Beijing's weaving and dyeing industry currently has more than 580 establishments, which is quite a few in number. However, household industries account for about 350 of them, and there are more than 200 manual weaving and dyeing factories. There are only about 20 factories with electric looms, and most of the machinery and equipment are outdated, far inferior to those in Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places. At the same time, there is not a single spinning mill in the city, and the cotton yarn is entirely dependent on external supply. Therefore, the cost and quality of the woven cloth are also lower. However, due to the underdevelopment of China's textile industry, during the period of the national movement to resist foreign goods and love the country from 1929 to 1935, Beijing's weaving and dyeing industry once flourished and made great progress. Until the period of the Japanese occupation, it was devastated by the Japanese cotton yarn system and the promotion of Japanese goods. During the Kuomintang rule, it suffered from the economic aggression of imperialism and the oppression of bureaucratic capital. The capital of the weaving and dyeing factories was weakened day by day. In addition, in the last two months of the Kuomintang's rule in Beijing, many factories were stationed with reactionary troops, and some looms were even split into firewood. After such destruction, the weaving and dyeing industry was left only with a dying breath.
　　After the liberation of Beijing, with the support of the People's Government Trading Company through methods such as "loan yarn," "yarn for cloth," and "processing," the weaving and dyeing factories gradually recovered. However, due to the past destruction by the enemy and puppets, many factories themselves had problems such as lack of funds, poor turnover, and poor management. In addition, some unenlightened capitalists in the past oppressed and insulted workers, and carried out excessive exploitation of workers. After liberation, workers who had been under long-term oppression were naturally bound to vent their anger. At the same time, some workers did not understand the economic situation of Chinese society and made excessive demands. Some capitalists were unwilling to actively improve the lives of workers, felt uneasy and worried, and adopted a negative attitude towards production. As a result, the factories suffered losses, and labor-management disputes continued to occur, making it difficult for some factories to maintain their operations, and some even suspended work.
　　According to cost calculations and the current actual situation of many factories, if electric weaving is used, a worker can look after two machines and weave 45 pieces of white cloth per month (weighing 11 catties, 86 warps per inch, 70 wefts, 110 feet long, 27.5 inches wide); if manual weaving is used, a worker can weave 17 pieces of cloth per month, then the factory can maintain its operations. If the workers can weave a little more, then there will be a surplus. According to the fact that an ordinary electric loom can weave one piece of cloth per day, even if the machine is a bit old, each worker can weave 50 pieces of white cloth a month if they look after two machines, unless there are special circumstances. Therefore, Beijing's electric weaving factories are currently sufficient to maintain their operations with a surplus, which can be used for development and gradually adding new electric machines. The household weaving industry, because there is no labor-management relationship, the whole family is mobilized and works in shifts. Weaving one piece of cloth can earn about 20 catties of millet as remuneration. There is no such thing as profit or loss, so it can still be maintained and can temporarily solve the unemployment problem of some people. Only weaving factories with more than ten or eight manual machines have encountered more serious difficulties, and most of them are in a state of being difficult to maintain. There is a seemingly incomprehensible phenomenon at present: according to the fact that a skilled weaving worker can weave 15 or 16 pieces of cloth per month, the average output of most factories is only about 10 pieces per worker per month, and some individual workers only weave 5 or 6 pieces of cloth per month; but there are also some (a small number of) manual weaving factories where workers can produce an average of 20 pieces per month, and individual workers can even weave up to 25 pieces. A worker who has been weaving for 16 years told me: "There are no profound technical problems in weaving white cloth. The difference between weaving fast and weaving slow is only about three to five pieces a month." Why is it that manual weaving can have a production difference of several times? Of course, some factory workers and machines used to weave fancy striped cloth and the like, which are not suitable for weaving white cloth; some factories have poor management, and the coordination between shafting, sizing, and weaving is not good, which affects production. Improper resolution of labor-management disputes or poor management system is also detrimental to production. As long as the labor-management relationship is good, production will be successful. For example, in the Jinglun Weaving and Dyeing Factory, the relationship between the accounting department and the workers is harmonious, and the coordination between sizing, shafting, and weaving is good. The weaving does not "wait for the shaft," and the sizing workers seize the time to work harder to harden the yarn even on cloudy days. As a result, the workers in the factory weave an average of 20 pieces of cloth per person per month, and individual workers can weave 25 or 26 pieces. Although Jinglun's machines are slightly better (previously used to weave canvas), it is no accident that they can achieve this result. The capital cares about the workers, the workers work hard to produce, and production develops, which is beneficial to both labor and capital.
　　Based on the above situation, it shows that to develop production, it is necessary to improve labor-management relations under the principle of benefiting both parties; and to stipulate a reasonable progressive wage system. The experience of the national pharmaceutical industry tells us that the signing of collective labor-management contracts is an effective way to resolve labor-management disputes and stipulate a reasonable wage system. The collective labor-management contract of Beijing's weaving and dyeing industry has been brewing for nearly three months, but it has been delayed due to some minor issues that have not been signed. The main reason is that some losing weaving factory capitalists still have opinions on the wages and dismissal methods stipulated in the draft collective contract, and they are wrongly afraid of the difficulty of paying wages and dismissing workers once the factory cannot maintain its operations. But you should think about it. If you do not quickly sign a collective labor-management contract, labor-management disputes cannot be resolved reasonably, production cannot be developed, and the factory's losses will increase day by day until it is completely lost. If it really comes to the point where it is completely lost, even the strength to change careers or merge and cooperate with other factories will be completely lost.
　　Manual weaving is ultimately backward. After labor-management disputes are resolved, even if workers can reach a level of weaving 16 or 17 pieces of cloth per month and the quality is improved, the factories will still only be able to maintain their operations and will not be able to develop towards refitting new electric machines. Therefore, it is still necessary to think of ways to reduce costs. The five weaving and dyeing factories in Beijing, including Xieshengxin, Gongda, Qingfeng, Tianlong, and Xinhua, have merged and jointly operated under the guidance of the government, and have established the "Beijing Joint Weaving and Dyeing Factory." The machines of the five factories are put together, and the machines, furniture, parts, etc. contributed by each factory are converted into shares. The number of workers remains the same as before the five factories. The number of staff in the accounting department can be reduced by half. For example, in the past, five factories had to have five managers and five accountants, but now only one manager and one accountant are enough. The remaining staff will participate in the production departments such as shafting and tassel making. In addition, expenses such as rent, telephone, lights, water, and stationery will also be saved a lot. The telephone bill alone can save about 80,000 yuan per month. According to a rough estimate, the cost of weaving can be reduced by about 30%, which means that each worker in each factory had to weave 17 pieces of cloth per month to maintain operations, but now about 13 pieces are enough to maintain operations. The five factories that merged used to lose 20 pieces of yarn per month. According to the estimated cost, the current joint factory can have a surplus of more than 1,700 catties of millet per month. Moreover, the factory has expanded, management can be standardized, and the number of workers has increased, so they can learn from each other's skills and compete in production. These five factories were originally on the verge of being unable to maintain their operations, and three of them, including Gongda, Qingfeng, and Tianlong, had suspended work. After merging and cooperating, all the machines were put into operation again. In the past, workers were working in a dying factory, so it was difficult to build up the mood for production. Now, seeing that the factory has expanded and is working vigorously, with a bright future, they naturally have a different mood to work hard to produce. At the opening of the joint factory, the workers' representatives said that they must produce more. The factory also guaranteed to prepare sufficient yarn and to expand the factory with the monthly surplus and gradually add electric machines. Based on the experience of the establishment of the "Joint Weaving and Dyeing Factory," the joint production of several factories can indeed reduce costs and improve quality, which is a way out for the manual weaving factories that cannot maintain their operations. The more factories that merge and cooperate, the more the cost will be reduced.
　　Another problem in Beijing's weaving and dyeing industry is that in the past, Beijing's weaving and dyeing factories mainly produced woolen cloth, woolen serge, fancy striped cloth, flannel, etc., and their sales areas were very wide, even reaching Yunnan Province. Few factories produced white cloth. Now, they all weave white cloth for the calico company. The machinery and equipment and workers' skills are not suitable, and no matter what, the products are not as good as the Hongwufu cloth of Tianjin Zhongfang No. 2 Factory. Therefore, in the future, they can gradually resume developing towards the characteristics of weaving woolen cloth and striped cloth. Recently, plaid striped cloth and the like have become slightly active in the market, and will gradually restore its certain sales volume with the increase in people's purchasing power in the future.
　　Now is the time for the weaving and dyeing industry to look forward to the moon. The manufacturers do not have to worry about not being able to size the yarn on cloudy days like in July. They should improve labor-management relations as soon as possible based on the principle of benefiting both parties, sign collective contracts, and create conditions for developing production. Factories with manual weaving can learn from the experience of the establishment of the "Joint Weaving and Dyeing Factory," merge and cooperate, and produce collectively to reduce costs and improve quality. If they still do not find a way, and continue to drag on by losing money until they sell machines and raw materials, they will inevitably be completely eaten up. If it really comes to the point where it is completely eaten up, even the strength to change careers or merge and cooperate with other factories will be completely lost.

　　北京织染业应向那里走？
    冯仲    中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领中，关于工业一项提出了应恢复和增加纺织业及其他有利于国计民生的轻工业生产。中国的机器纺织业总数不到五百万纱锭（其中有一半集中在上海），比之于印度的三千五百万纱锭约为七分之一，就全国四亿七千五百万人口所需的衣着计，需要五千万纱锭才足以供应；而全国目前已有的（包括待解放区）尚不足十分之一，平津和华北解放区的纱锭则仅十五万锭。今后在不仰仗外人、力求自给的原则下，为了供应广大人民日常衣着消费的需要，纺织染业有极大的发展前途，而且是必须要发展的。当然，我们的目标是发展新式的电力机织布，但是在全国工业未能全部恢复之前，一时尚不可能全部采用自动电力机织布。在这种情况下，大中城市现有的老式织布机仍需维持其生产。在长期的抗日反蒋战争中，由于日寇及国民党匪徒对城市与乡村无度的压榨，人民的购买力已普遍降至最低程度，因之形成目前销路迟滞的现象，但这并不能表示织布生产过剩，这种现象将随全国的解放、新民主主义经济的日益发展与人民购买力的逐渐提高而消除。
    北京的织染业现在共有五百八十余家，以数目言确属不少，惟其中家庭工业约占三百五十余家，另外有约二百多家的人力织染工厂，而电力织布机的厂子仅仅二十余家，且大多机器设备陈腐，远逊于沪、青、津等地，同时全市无一家纺纱厂，棉纱全仰仗外地供给，因之，织出的布成本高质量也较低。但由于中国纺织业之不发达，在全国抵制外货爱国运动时期的一九二九年至一九三五年间，北京的织染业也曾一度兴盛，有了很大的发展。直至沦陷时期，在受日寇棉纱编制及日货推销的摧残；到国民党统治时期，更是外受帝国主义的经济侵略，内遭官僚资本的压迫，各织染工厂的资金一天天的削弱，加上国民党最后统治北京的两个月中，各工厂多驻满了反动军队，有的织布机竟劈成柴烧掉，经过这样的破坏，织染业只余奄奄一息了。
    北京解放，经过人民政府贸易公司用“贷纱”，“以纱换布”、“加工”等方式扶植，各织染厂逐渐恢复。但终因过去敌伪摧残，许多工厂本身均存在着资金缺少、周转不灵、管理不良等问题，加上过去某些不开明的资本家，因压迫侮辱工人，对工人进行过重的剥削，解放后，工人在长久压迫之下自然难免要出这口气，同时，这中间也有一部分工人由于对中国社会的经济情况了解不够，而提出过高的要求，有些资本家不肯积极改善工人生活，则心存不安和顾虑，对生产抱消极度态，因之厂子赔累，劳资之间不断发生纠纷，致使一部分工厂难以维持，甚至有的暂停了工。
    根据成本计算，及许多工厂的目前实际情况，如果用电力机织布，一个工人看两台机子，每月能织大白布（重十一斤，每寸经八十六根，纬七十根，一一○尺长，二十七寸半宽）四十五匹；人力织布一个工人每月能织布十七匹，则工厂就可以维持。工人如能再多织出一些，那就有盈余了。按照普通电力织布机每天能织一匹布，纵然机子陈旧一些，每一工人看两台机子，如无特殊情况，一个月织五十匹白布总是可以的。所以北京的电力织布厂目前是足以维持而有余，并能以盈余用于发展，逐渐添设新式电力机。家庭织布工业，因为无劳资关系，全家动员，轮流工作，织出一匹布就可以有约二十斤小米的报酬，无所谓赔与赚，所以也还能维持，且可暂时解决一部分人的失业问题。只是有十台、八台人力机子较多的织布工厂却遭到较严重的难关，大多数陷于难以维持的状态。对这问题目前发生了表面上难以理解的现象：按照一个熟练的织布工人一个月普通可织十五、六匹布、而多数的厂子每个工人每月平均产量只有十匹左右，甚至有个别工人一个月只织五、六匹布；但却又有的人力织布厂（少数的）工人每月每人平均生产到二十匹，甚至个别工人可以织到二十五匹。一个织布十六年的工人告诉我：“织大白布并没有深奥的技术问题存在，织的快的和织的慢的一月也不过差个三、五匹”。为什么同时人力织布，生产量竟能差到好几倍呢。固然，有些厂厂子的工人和机子从前只织花条布之类，不适于织大白布；有的厂子管理不善，打轴、浆线与织布不能很好的配合，这些都影响了生产。劳资间纠纷不适当的解决或管理经营制度不良，同样对生产是不利的。只要劳资关系搞得好的生产就有成绩，如经纶织染厂，柜房与工人之间感情融洽，浆纱、打轴、打穗与织布配合的好，织布不“等轴”，浆纱工人在连阴天也抓紧时间多卖力气将纱浆硬；因之该厂工人平均每月每人织布二十匹，个别工人可织到二十五、六匹，虽然经纶的机子略好（以前织帆布），但能得到这个成绩绝不是偶然的，资方关心工人，工人努力生产，生产发展，劳资双方都有利。
    根据以上情况，说明要发展生产，必须在两利原则下搞好劳资关系；并要规定合理的累进工资制。国药业的经验告诉我们，订立劳资集体合同是解决劳资纠纷规定合理工资制的有效办法；北京织染业劳资集体合同已经酝酿了近三个月，但终因一些枝节问题还未能签字，一直在拖延着。主要原因是一些赔钱的织布厂资方对集体合同草案中规定的工资及解雇工人办法尚有意见，错误恐惧着一旦到厂子不能维持时，发不了工资，又不易解雇工人的困难。但是应该想一想如不迅速订立劳资集体合同，劳资纠纷不能合理解决，生产发展不了，厂子赔钱更会一天天增多，直至赔干为止。
    人力织布终究是落后的，在劳资纠纷解决了之后，纵然工人们每人都能达到每月织十六、七匹布的水平，质量也提高，而各工厂仍然只够维持而已，尚谈不到向改装新式电力机方面发展，所以还必须要再从减低成本上想办法。北京的协盛鑫、工大、庆丰、天龙、信华等五家织染厂，经政府指导，已经合并联合经营，成立了“北京联营织染工厂”，五家的机子凑在一起，按各家出的机子、家具、零件等折价入股，工人仍维持以前五家的数目，柜房里的职员则可减少一半，如过去五个厂子必须有五个经理，五个司帐，现在只一个经理一个司帐就够了，多余的职员则参加到打轴、打穗等生产部门工作。此外如房租、电话、灯、水、文具等杂项开支也都节省许多，只电话费一项每月就可省约八万元。据粗略估计，织布成本共可减低约十分之三，也就是以前各厂每一工人每月要织十七匹布才能维持，现在约织到十三匹就可以维持了。合并的五家工厂，过去每月每家要赔二十块纱，现在的联营工厂，根据估计的成本，每月可盈余一千七百多斤小米，而且工厂扩大了，管理可以正规化，工人增多了，可以互相学习技术，竞赛生产。这五家厂子本来都已经到了难以维持的地步，且其中工大、庆丰、天龙等三家已暂停了工，经合并联营后，机子又全动起来了，工人们过去在一个垂死的工厂里做工，当然很难打起生产情绪；现在眼看着工厂扩大了，又朝气勃勃的干起来，前途有了光明，自然又是一番心情的要努力生产了。在联营工厂开张的时候，工人代表讲话说：一定要多生产。厂方也保证准备充足的纱，而且要以每月盈余扩充工厂，逐渐增添电力机。我们根据“联营织染工厂”成立的经验，几家工厂联营生产确能减低成本，提高质量，是目前不能维持的人力织布厂的一条出路。合并联营的厂家愈多，成本减低也愈多。
    北京织染业的另一问题是过去北京各织染厂多以织线呢、线哗叽、花条布、绒布等为主，销行地域很广，甚至曾达到云南省，很少有织大白布的厂子。现在则一律给花纱布公司织白布，机子设备及工人技术既不适宜，且无论如何出品不如天津中纺二厂的红五福布，所以今后仍可逐渐地恢复向织线呢条布等特点上发展。最近花格条布等在市场上已稍见活动，今后将随人民购买力的提高而恢复它一定的销路。
    现在正是织染业的望月，厂家们不必耽心再有象七月间连阴天不能浆线的时候，应尽速根据两利原则了搞好劳资关系，订立集体合同，为发展生产创设条件。人力织布的工厂更可吸取“联营织染工厂”成立的经验，合并联营，集体生产，以减低成本，提高质量，如果仍然不设法，任其赔钱蚀本，以致卖机器、卖原料地继续拖下去，势必吃干为止。如果真到吃干的时候，连转业或与他家厂子合并联营的力量也会完全失掉了。
