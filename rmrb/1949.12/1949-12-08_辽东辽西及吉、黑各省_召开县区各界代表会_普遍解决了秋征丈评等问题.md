Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th. Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Provinces have successively convened representative meetings of people from all walks of life in counties and districts. These meetings have focused on resolving one or two major issues related to the lives of the vast majority of the people. In Liaodong Province, seventeen counties and two hundred districts and towns have already held representative meetings of people from all walks of life. Leading cadres in various parts of the province have attached great importance to the representative meetings, making full preparations before the meetings to ensure that the masses have a correct understanding of the representative meetings, and sending personnel to assist in the leadership. Tonghua, Andong, and other counties first selected a district as a pilot, gained experience, and then promoted it to various districts. In Liaoxi, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, sixteen counties have already held representative meetings. Most of them made full preparations before the meeting. In the representative meetings of the people from all walks of life in the above-mentioned counties and districts, issues such as autumn grain collection, land measurement and appraisal (that is, in some newly liberated areas after the land reform, measuring land area and appraising land grade), developing sideline occupations, combining production with disaster relief, and connecting urban and rural trade were universally resolved. Yongji County, Jilin Province, resolved at the people's representative meeting to mobilize farmers to pay good grain, investigate black land, and re-evaluate output, in order to implement the policies of determining land rights, rewarding production, and rational burden. Fuxin County in Liaoxi Province determined that grain collection is the current central task, and specifically stipulated the methods for allocating tasks and conducting evaluation. In addition to typical reports on sideline production by representatives, Xinmin County in the same province also proposed the call to "have no idle people in the family, and no idle horses in the stable" at the people's representative meeting. When discussing the issue of connecting urban and rural trade, many counties and districts exchanged information on urban and rural consignment sales. The representative meeting in Heishan County, Liaoxi Province, decided to organize rural inspection teams to understand the needs of farmers; Fuxin County prepared to establish farmer reception stations to facilitate farmers entering the city. In addition, according to special circumstances, discussions and resolutions were also made on issues such as labor-capital relations, repairing river mouths, and organizing winter schools. The representatives expressed satisfaction with the convening of the meeting. The convening of county and district representative meetings has further strengthened the ties between the government and the people, and has also greatly educated and cultivated cadres and the masses.

　　辽东辽西及吉、黑各省
  　召开县区各界代表会
    普遍解决了秋征丈评等问题
    【新华社沈阳七日电】辽东、辽西、吉林、黑龙江各省已相继召开县、区各界人民代表会议。这些会议都集中地解决了有关绝大多数人民生活的一两个重大问题。辽东省已开过各界人民代表会议的有十七个县二百区、镇。该省各地领导干部对人民代表会议都很重视，在开会前除作了充分准备，使群众对人民代表会议有正确认识外，并派员分别帮助领导。通化、安东等县都先选择一个区作为试验，取得经验后再推及各区。辽西、吉林、黑龙江各省已开过代表会议的亦有十六个县。大部都在会前作了充分的准备工作。在上述各县区的人民代表会议中，普遍解决了秋征、丈评（就是在一部分实行土地改革后新解放区，丈量土地面积与评议土地等级）、开展副业、生产结合救灾及沟通城乡贸易等问题。吉林省永吉县在人民代表会议上决议发动农民交纳好粮，调查黑地，重评产量，以贯彻确定地权、奖励生产、合理负担等政策。辽西阜新县则确定征粮为目前中心工作，并具体规定了分配任务及进行评议的办法，该省新民县人民代表会上除由代表作了副业生产的典型报告外，并提出作到“家无闲人，厩无闲马”的号召。许多县区在讨论沟通城乡贸易问题时，更交换了城乡的代销情况。辽西省黑山县的代表会上既决定组织农村考察组，了解农民需要；阜新县准备成立农民招待站，便利农民进城。此外，各地根据特殊情况，对劳资关系、培修河口、组织冬学等问题亦作了讨论和解决。代表们对会议的召开都表满意。由于县、区代表会议的召开，进一步密切了政府与人民的联系，对干部和群众也有很大的教育作育。
