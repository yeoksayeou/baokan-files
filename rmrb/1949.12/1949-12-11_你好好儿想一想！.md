　　"Think it Over Carefully!"
　　Zhang Zhimin
　　Sunday came, and the office was closed. After breakfast, I went out with several comrades to various places. We didn't take a car; we walked around. Although it didn't seem like a long time, winter days are so short. As we walked back from the west, the moon's shadow closely followed us.

　　A day of running around had exhausted my already ailing body, making my bones feel like they were about to fall apart. I collapsed on the bed as soon as I got home. Just then, the gatekeeper shouted in the courtyard: "Zhang Zhimin! Someone's looking for you at the gate!"

　　Since someone had come to find me, I couldn't lie down any longer. I jumped out of bed and went out without even putting on my hat. Suddenly, I didn't feel tired at all, and my footsteps were as loud as ever.

　　I lived in the back courtyard, and I had to walk through three courtyards to get to the main gate. Afraid that the person waiting would get anxious, and it was so cold outside, I quickened my pace and ran all the way to the gate.

　　It was just dark, and the light at the gate didn't seem very bright. I vaguely saw a person in a dark green military uniform. As he approached, he reached out to shake my hand, and I realized it was Li Jincai. He was a handsome young man of about twenty-five or twenty-six from Wanping, my fellow villager. Although not exactly old comrades-in-arms, we had worked together, slept on the same kang, and shared the same pot. His older brother, Li Jinzhong, was also an old colleague of mine. His brother had sacrificed himself in 1943. Because of this, I was particularly close to Li Jincai.

　　He was pushing a brand-new bicycle. I couldn't make out the brand, but it looked like a foreign make. I only noticed the bright generator light on the front of the bike. Although it wasn't lit, the glass was bright enough. The spokes and wheels were gleaming, the rims were sky blue, and there were some gadgets that I don't remember. Anyway, it was a very beautiful bike.

　　I said, "Your bike is so beautiful! A fine bike for a fine man." He seemed to have many complaints about the bike, but he couldn't tell me all of them at the gate, so he just said, "It's good, but it's like a mother holding a child – it belongs to someone else."

　　"Whose is it?"

　　"Bought by the government. Each cadre gets one. I heard that some organizations give the bikes to individuals, but not ours. They just let us ride them!"

　　I said, "A bike is for riding, isn't it? It's fine to just let you ride it. What difference does it make whether it's given to you personally? I think the rules there are pretty good."

　　He muttered, "That's what you say, but it would be more convenient to have your own to ride." He casually pulled out the key from the bike, and the lock clicked shut automatically. We talked and walked to the front of my house.

　　My house was very small and low. The walls were made of reed mats. A large room had been divided into three small rooms. I lived in the one on the east side. To keep warm, I had haphazardly pasted some old newspapers on the mats, which made it look even less attractive. The lightbulb was only 25 watts, so it wasn't very bright. There was a small coal stove, which made the room smoky and not very warm. I opened the door and invited him in. His first exclamation was: "This is outrageous! How can you survive the winter in this room? Living in this capital city of Beijing, in a grand government office, and living in a house like this? Don't you feel suffocated? This house, in Beijing, is like the 'Economy Barber Shop' on Dongdan Market. In our hometown, it's just like a 'melon patch shed'! This, this is outrageous!"

　　Since he was a guest I hadn't seen in a long time, I couldn't immediately reprimand him for saying such things. I just retorted with a smile: "I'm quite satisfied with my house. It's small, warm, and has no problems except for the poor lighting. There are many offices and many people. If everyone lived in good houses, where would there be enough?"

　　Because an old colleague I hadn't seen for many years had come, I should treat him well. I pulled out a box of cigarettes from the drawer, took one out, and handed it to him. These cigarettes were newly issued "July 1st" cigarettes. The tobacco was golden yellow and smelled very good. Back in the liberated areas, these were considered high-quality cigarettes! In those days, people smoked large-leaf tobacco in pipes. Sometimes, several people would share one cigarette. "July 1st" cigarettes like these weren't available every day. So, as I handed him the cigarette, I said, "This is old border region 'July 1st' cigarette. Smoking this cigarette makes me think of the old border region!" He glanced at it without saying anything, just waved his hand, and took out a pink cigarette case with a floral pattern from his pocket. The case even had a small lighter attached to it. He opened it, took out a cigarette, and handed it to me, saying, "This is good. Try it!" I didn't hesitate. "Okay! I'll take yours! But the 'July 1st' cigarette is already very fragrant!" He lit the cigarette with the lighter. I took a strong drag, and before I could say, "This cigarette is indeed fragrant!" he asked, "How is it? Good to smoke, right?" I said, "My addiction isn't that strong. As long as it produces smoke, it's fine." After saying that, I took out my pipe from the box and asked him, "Do you still recognize it?" He took it and examined it carefully. This pipe was very crude. If you threw it on a pile of rotten firewood, someone might think it was just a piece of rotten wood and wouldn't even pick it up. But who knew it had a glorious history? In 1944, when we went up the mountain to cultivate buckwheat, Li Jincai dug up a piece of jujube wood. The wood looked like a pipe, with a big head and a tail. He gave it to me, and I took it back and spent a few spare hours carving it into the shape of a pipe with a knife. Then, I made a hole with a hot wire and polished the outside with walnut oil. For several years, it helped me with a lot of work. When I was tired of working, I would take it out, and whether it was large-leaf tobacco, yellow flower tobacco, or sesame stalks, it would satisfy my craving. After a few bowls, my spirits would immediately lift. But these years of bumps and bruises have left it scarred and not as beautiful as before. Especially these days, since I've had cigarettes, I've put it away, and it seems to have a lot of dust on it.

　　After examining it, he said, "You're really conservative. Why don't you throw this thing away? Do you want to take it to an antique shop to sell it as an antique?" I said, "It's not that I want to sell it as an antique, but I can't bear to throw it away. I've lost it several times, but I've always found it again. It's not like I don't have it now. It's good for smoking cigarette butts. When there are no cigarettes, it's still my close friend."

　　After sitting for a while, I started to ask him why he had come, where he was living now, and what work he was doing.

　　We had parted ways after leaving Zhangjiakou, and this was the first time we had met since then. At that time, he was a reconnaissance staff officer in the regiment. He was young, clever, and nicknamed "Smarty." Although he had only attended junior high school for a few days, he had learned a lot of knowledge after joining the army. Among the staff officers in the regiment, he was quite capable. He just liked to show off. That year, his regiment fought at Wangzhuang, and he made a great contribution. It was good to make a contribution, but he told everyone about it, always trying to show how resourceful he was in reconnaissance work, saying that his good reconnaissance was the only condition for taking Wangzhuang, afraid that someone wouldn't know he had made a contribution. This made people dislike him. In addition, he was not careful in his personal life. He always liked to be flashy. He would have his uniform altered into riding breeches. Regardless of whether the pens worked or not, he would carry two or three in his small pocket. The steel chain on his pocket watch was always exposed half a foot long, swinging back and forth on his chest, like a silver lock worn by a child. He thought he looked good, but others would just curl their lips when they saw him. He also loved to chat. When he started chatting, besides his "passing five gates and slaying six generals," it was all about eating and drinking. Which wine shop had newly arrived good baijiu, which restaurant had smoked chicken? Because he liked these things, he paid special attention to these things when he looked at others. Who got an extra quilt for what reason! Who was sick and the superiors approved rice for him? He was most informed about which organization's house was good and which unit ate more refined grains. When he said these things, others would say to him: "No wonder you're a reconnaissance staff officer!" A few days before we parted, because he had taken apart the cotton-padded clothes issued by the government and made them into lined clothes, the chief of staff criticized him. He pouted and said behind his back: "Such a small matter, it's all about the system! All about thrift! Don't you think about who did the reconnaissance at Wangzhuang. Without me, even if you, the chief of staff, were highly skilled at commanding, you would just be staring blankly. So many guns, cannons, bullets, rice, and white flour were captured, countless valuable things. And I used this little bit of broken cotton and it became a matter of system!" After that, I heard that he was punished. He never joined the Party. He filled out the application form several times, but the branch never approved it.

　　I asked, "How did you start wearing this kind of uniform?"

　　He said very proudly: "I'm doing work for the Public Security Bureau now. After running around on the front lines for so many years, it's time to rest in the rear!"

　　I said, "It's hard to say whether it's time or not. Aren't several of our field armies still advancing? It's not necessarily that simple. Wherever you're needed, you go."

　　Then he told me that he was recuperating in Tianjin, and his health was very bad. To take care of his health, the superiors introduced him to work in Tianjin.

　　I was just about to ask about the situation in Tianjin, but he asked me first: "What system do you have now? How much money do you get each month?"

　　I said: "It's still the same 'system' as before. Whatever is issued when, and a few coins a month to buy cigarettes."

　　He continued: "Speaking of which, we're a bit better off than you. We have a 'contract system.' Besides food, we can save dozens of catties of rice each month, but it's hard to swallow this pill. In one organization, there are several grades. Some have less important jobs than us, but they have a 'salary system.' When it comes time to get paid, you see them taking tens of thousands of dollars, and we're left with a few coins. We can't even buy anything worthwhile. But when it comes to work, we have to be model workers. When others come to work, they come. When others leave work, they leave. We live in the organization all day long. If something happens in the middle of the night, you can't not get up and take care of it. It seems that we old revolutionaries are not as good as the new revolutionaries?"

　　I felt that his thinking was very problematic. I immediately retorted: "What did you say is not as good? Are you saying it's not as good as having a higher position, not as good as earning more money, not as good as eating well? Did we join the revolution for personal status, for personal material enjoyment?"

　　"Of course not," he said. "But the more effort you put in, the more reward you should get. Aren't we old revolutionaries making a greater contribution than the new revolutionaries? I don't think it's reasonable."

　　"Old Li," I said, "We used to work together, and we know each other well. I might as well be frank! I think it's wrong to boast about your own merits. Aren't we able to live decently today because of the education of the revolution? How can we take credit for ourselves? The more our revolutionary ranks expand, the more talent joins the construction, isn't that more conducive to the development of the people and the country?"

　　I glanced at Jincai and said patiently, "Think it over carefully! What interests does this idea of yours stem from?"

　　Li Jincai did not speak. I continued: "Our war hasn't ended yet, and production and construction are by no means a matter of ten days or eight days. We can't talk about enjoyment yet. We must still be frugal and tide over this difficult time. We must adhere to the style of 'suffering first, enjoying later,' not calculating status and material benefits, and wholeheartedly dedicating ourselves to the revolution..."

　　Li Jincai lowered his head and pondered.

　　I really felt that his wrong thinking was very dangerous. I also wondered what he had really come to Beijing for. It couldn't just be to see me. There must be another reason. So I asked him, "Are you here to do anything else?"

　　He said unhappily: "Don't mention it. It's infuriating just to think about it. I came to send my wife and children here." When I heard that his wife and children had also come, and it was so cold outside, I quickly asked him: "Where are they? Why didn't you ask them to come in?" He said: "I sent them home and came back. I stayed at home for three days, and it really disgusted me. My wife is a feudal woman, and there's a child. Should I tell her to come out to work? She can't even read half a liter of characters. Should I get a divorce? The organization won't allow it."

　　I said, "How can you think of divorce? You already have children. I've seen your wife. She's a good, authentic peasant woman, honest, hardworking, and very good."

　　He didn't pay attention to my words, but continued in the order he wanted to say: "A month ago, she went to Tianjin to find me. She looked so embarrassed, like a refugee. How could I dare to let her see people? Her rusticity is indescribable. She didn't even dare to sit on the sofa. She took a walk on the street and couldn't find her way back to the gate. She caught a cold under my nose. The director even said: 'It's not easy to come once, stay for a few more days, take her out and look around. If we hadn't won, who from a poor family could afford to enter the city!' He didn't think about it. How could I show off such a treasure? How could I take her for a walk on the street? I still have face! I feel ashamed. This time, I'll settle her at home. I don't hope for a divorce. I don't hope to see her again. I told her to cultivate herself at home!"

　　This speech made me indignant. I felt that Li Jincai had become terrible! He treated his wife so ruthlessly, slandering and insulting this kind, working woman, and almost degenerating to the point of losing his position! Although I still took into account that he was a guest, my indignant heart made my voice impatient: "Then why did you marry her in the first place? It wasn't like she was the one who found you, right? At that time, you had a free love. Now you find her displeasing! What do you want to do in the future?"

　　"That was then! Of course, I thought she was good then, but that was relative. If there's no cinnabar, red soil is precious. Compared to the village, she was okay. But now..."

　　I interrupted: "What now? Now you've seen a big modern woman! This is a serious problem. Divorce is possible, but there must be a legitimate reason. You can't just break up when you don't want to. Besides, you can't cross the river and tear down the bridge. Wasn't it just us earthy peasants who persisted in these years of struggle? Is being earthy shameful? Are you saying that those who dress up like monsters all day long, who only eat and don't work, are glorious?"

　　"I'm not saying she's shameful. I just feel very embarrassed. I don't like looking at her."

　　"It's you who's changed. You have a problem. She hasn't changed. You feel unsatisfied. I think your wife is very good. There's no reason for divorce!"

　　The fire in the stove was burning fiercely. The red and green flames intertwined into a bright red peony. Although we were not arguing, because no one blushed, our opinions on this issue differed, so many questions that should have been asked were forgotten, and we both fell silent.

　　Just then, the gatekeeper shouted again: "Zhang Zhimin! Someone's looking for you again, go take a look!" I knew that friends would come to play on Sundays, so I thought it must not be official business. I asked Li Jincai to wait for me and come back to talk.

　　As I walked, I asked the gatekeeper: "What does he look like?" He told me: "He's someone on crutches." My heart jumped! I couldn't think of any of my friends who used crutches for a moment, so I quickly quickened my pace to the gate.

　　The light at the gate was shining, so dazzlingly bright. From afar, he looked like my old comrade-in-arms, Wang Qiang, whom I hadn't seen for five or six years. I warmly rushed forward and hugged him, but because he didn't use much effort with his crutches, he almost fell. At that time, I couldn't think of anything to ask him. I just pointed to his legs in surprise and said: "This, what happened?" His expression was extremely calm. He said: "It's nothing, it's almost better!" I asked again, and this was what I had to ask continuously: "This won't...?" He quickly said: "It won't be a disability!" I wanted to help him walk in, but he refused, and told me to walk in front. He still said optimistically: "I've practiced my martial arts well in the hospital these few months. I can chase bicycles with these crutches." I laughed, thinking his exaggerated statement was very interesting. But he jumped ahead of me in three or two leaps. He was indeed fast!

　　Entering the house, before I could introduce them, they already knew each other. When Wang Qiang was a political instructor, Li Jincai was his deputy company commander in the battalion. So, they had a relationship of superiors and subordinates. Li Jincai hurriedly stood up to offer him a seat, looking somewhat restrained. I turned a stool upside down and put a cotton cushion on top, so that he could sit comfortably. He skillfully leaned his two crutches against the stool, and his left leg lay straight on the crutches. Then he jokingly told us: "This movement is also newly learned."

　　We laughed, we all laughed! The laughter made me start to reminisce. Wang Qiang, like his name, was very strong. He was thirty-six years old, from an intellectual background, and went to Yan'an Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in 1938. After graduation, he always worked in the army. He was good at political work, and he was a good general in battle. During the Pinghan Line campaign, he was the political instructor. The battalion commander sacrificed himself. He led a battalion of men to wipe out the enemy and complete the mission. No one among the soldiers didn't say that Political Instructor Wang was both civil and military. Speaking of his lifestyle, it was also very difficult. When marching, he always gave the horse to the sick soldiers to ride. The soldiers were very familiar with the temper of that jujube-red horse with white hooves. If you said the horse was Political Instructor Wang's, they would correct you: "This horse belongs to the sick soldiers." The soldiers wrote articles praising him, and the articles were published a little late, which made the soldiers very anxious. They all said: "It doesn't matter if our articles are published or not, but Political Instructor's virtues must be praised!" Wang Qiang explained to the soldiers: "Our good work is the responsibility we should fulfill, what do we need praise for? If we don't do well, it's your fault, which will affect the revolution and should be criticized." These old impressions reappeared in my memory.

　　Under the electric light, I carefully looked to see if his appearance had changed. It had changed. He was older. Deep wrinkles like chicken feet were carved deeply on the corners of his eyes. This had already told me about his years of fighting. I looked more carefully and saw an apricot-kernel-sized scar on his lower lip. The color of the scar was purplish-black. I stared intently, wishing I could touch it with my hand and ask him if it still hurt. At this time, he spoke. He asked: "Are you looking at this scar? There are more on my leg. This is the achievement of forty-five years. Other places are okay, but this scar on my mouth swelled my face into a gourd. My mouth was so small that I could barely fit a chopstick in it. I couldn't eat anything for many days. It was only when the nurse fed me a little milk with a spoon that I realized that people are like watches, if one part doesn't work well, it won't work."

　　Again we laughed! He made us laugh heartily. I lit a cigarette for him. He began to ask where Li Jincai was working, what he was doing, and how his progress was. After asking, he told us: "This time I was injured in Taiyuan. After coming down, I recuperated in Shijiazhuang. My legs were injured by shelling, with seven or eight wounds of various sizes. Because mud was blown into the wounds when I was injured, the wounds never healed. I had five operations. Each time it was half painful, and it hasn't healed completely yet, but it doesn't matter too much, because it's almost healed. That's why I came to Beijing to see things. I stayed at my cousin's house and only found out you were here when I met an acquaintance on the street."

　　I was happy that he came, and didn't know how to treat him. But when he mentioned every detail, I seemed to see it with my own eyes. I saw that he was injured, he was trembling all over in pain, but he was very stubborn. He came to the hospital to recuperate. I saw the scalpels, scissors, and bloodied cloths flashing in my eyes. I looked at Li Jincai's expression, which was somewhat frightened. I wondered what would happen if it happened to him.

　　I took the thermos and poured a cup of hot water, handing it to Wang Qiang. He carefully held the cup, as if he saw how precious the water was! He pointed to the thermos and said: "It's much more convenient to drink boiling water with this thing. How long can this keep warm?" I said: "This is a 'Three Yuan' brand. It's supposed to keep warm for twenty-four hours, but I haven't specifically tested it." He also said: "Water is a treasure. Don't look at how much is flowing in the big river. When it's scarce, it's more expensive than perfume. For many days in Taiyuan, I couldn't drink boiling water. My throat was so dry it was smoking. At that time, I thought water must be sweeter than honey. For many days I couldn't wash my face. When I woke up, I would moisten the corners of my eyes with saliva and wipe away the eye gunk. At the celebration meeting, they celebrated the meritorious soldiers not by toasting with wine, but by toasting with water. And there were restrictions on toasting with water. It wasn't: 'Please have a cup!' But: 'Please take a sip!' Having a thermos now is really paradise, paradise!"

　　I didn't participate in the battle of Taiyuan, but when he said this, it made me think of when we were resisting "sweeps" during the Anti-Japanese War, when we couldn't drink water for several days, and we swallowed saliva, but we couldn't swallow enough saliva! When we finished swallowing, there was nowhere to find more. We were in a stone cave on a mountain, with water droplets dripping from above like pearls. I held a small bowl underneath, and it took half a day to drip a bowl of water, which was mixed and the color of coffee. Even this bowl of "coffee" had to promote mutual aid and friendship, and everyone shared it and drank it.

　　This man, still carrying unhealed wounds, spoke in a way that didn't seem like he had wounds on his body at all. His voice was so loud and powerful. He asked: "Do you know Liu Yun?"

　　I said: "I know him. Small guy, fat man, used to be a company commander."

　　"He was injured a month earlier than me. Very seriously, three machine gun bullets pierced his legs, and his bones were broken. As soon as he was carried down, the doctor said to amputate his legs. He refused to have them amputated. He said: 'I would rather die with a whole body.' Later, the wound festered and the flesh turned black. Amputating his legs was dangerous. That's why he was persuaded to have them amputated. Now the wound is healed. He's missing a left leg. When I came, he went to the Veterans' School."

　　My nerves tensed, and my back felt a little cold. I hated it. I knew that my comrade-in-arms' left leg was taken away by Chiang Kai-shek, the bandit. He also took away the legs of thousands upon thousands of people!

　　He also said: "And, and Jia Zhonglin, do you know him?"

　　I said: "I know, I know, we're quite familiar with him, what happened to him?"

　　"He died a heroic death!"

　　His voice became lower, his throat became a little hoarse, and tears welled up in his firm eyes. My eyes stung, and tears poured down, Li Jincai was also wiping his eyes. At this time, except for the small kettle on the stove hissing, the whole room was silent.

　　After a while, Wang Qiang opened his eyes wide again. His eyeballs weren't black and white, but orange-red. He slapped his thigh and said: "When the soldiers of the whole battalion heard that Battalion Commander Jia Zhonglin had sacrificed, their lungs were about to explode. They unanimously proposed: 'Avenge Battalion Commander Jia Zhonglin, and march into Taiyuan!' I was leading the assault company, and I was injured in my leg when attacking a bunker."

　　Li Jincai seemed to have something tormenting him in his heart. He couldn't sit still, and he paced back and forth on the ground, sometimes frowning, sometimes lowering his head. Weren't Wang Qiang's words just meant for him?

　　At this time, Wang Qiang wanted to leave. We all stood up. I asked again: "Old Wang, where are you planning to work in the future?"

　　He said: "When my injuries are healed, I'll still go to the army to continue pursuing the Chiang bandits and completely eliminate the enemy. What does this little injury matter? If a few pieces of meat are lost, can't they still be 'filled and repaired'?"

　　When he said this, I suddenly remembered something. I opened the box and took out an old diary, quickly flipped through a few pages, and handed it to Wang Qiang, saying: "Look, this is what you wrote to me on September 12, 1944, when we parted ways, comrade," I turned to Li Jincai: "You take a look too!" Li Jincai snatched it over and read: "When you feel dissatisfied with material enjoyment, you should savor the hard work of the past. When you are troubled by personal interests, you should remind yourself that our dedication to the revolution is not for personal interests. We are only fighting for the interests of the people. Whoever plans for personal gain will be abandoned by the people!" After Li Jincai finished reading, he lowered his head, as if expressing shame in the face of these two sentences.

　　I sent Wang Qiang out. Li Jincai also wanted to go together, because he had to catch the train to Tianjin, so the three of us went out together. Ahead of me, one was a young man pushing a car, lowering his head, as if thinking about something as he walked. He wasn't as frivolous as when he had just arrived. The other was a wounded soldier on crutches. He jumped with so much energy. Under the moonlight, I saw the shadows of his four legs swaying. I watched them walk very far, very far away.

　　Returning to my house, the fire was still burning in the stove, the kettle was still hissing on the stove, half a cup of water was left in the teacup that Wang Qiang had drunk from, and there were several cigarette butts on the floor that Li Jincai had smoked. Everything was as if the guests had just left.

　　I closed my eyes and lay down, but I didn't sleep. The scene of this Sunday night was clearly imprinted in my mind.

专栏：

　　“你好好儿想一想！”
    张志民
    星期日来了，机关里是休息，早饭后，我和几个同志一块儿出去转了许多地方，没有坐车，我们是走来走去的，虽说觉着时间并不太长，可是冬季的白天是那么短，在我们从西边向回走的时候，月亮的影子就紧跟在我们背后了。
    跑了一天已经把我这带病的身体累得骨头都象是要散了，回到家里就倒在床上。正在这个时候，门房的老头在院子里喊着：“张志民！门口有人找！”
    已经有人来找了，我不能再躺下去，我猛的从床上坐起来，连帽子也没有戴就走了出去，这会一点儿也不觉得累了，走路的脚步声还是和以前那么响。
    我是住在紧后面的院子里，要穿过三个院子才能走到大门口，我怕等的人着急，外面又那么冷，就加快了几步，一直跑到了门口。
    天刚黑，门口的电灯显得还不明亮，我迷迷糊糊的看去，是一个穿着深绿色军服的人，走近时，他向我来握手，我才看清原来是李进财。他是一个二十五六岁的漂亮小伙子，宛平人，跟我是乡亲，虽不能说是老战友吧，也在一块工作过，一个炕上睡过觉，一个锅里碰过马勺；他哥哥李进忠和我也是老同事，他哥哥在四三年就牺牲了，因为有这一层，我跟李进财也就特别熟悉。
    他推着一辆崭新的自行车，什么牌子的我看不清，看样子是个西洋货，我只是看到这车前一只雪明的磨电灯，虽说没有亮，但那块玻璃已经够亮的了；浮条、车轮都是雪明的，瓦圈是天蓝色的，是有些什么零碎的装置，我已经记不清了，反正是一辆很漂亮的车子吧。
    我先说：“你这辆车子好漂亮呀，真是什么人骑什么车。”他像是对这车子的事，还有很多不满，而又不能在门口一气向我说出来，就只说了几句：“好是好，老妈抱孩子，人家的。”
    “谁的？”
    “公家买的，一个师傅一个令，听说有的机关把车子发给个人，我们那不同，只是叫骑！”
    我说：“车子就是骑的吗，叫骑就行，发不发给个人又有什么关系，我看你们那儿的规矩就挺好。”
    他嘴叨念着：“话可是那么说，倒是自己有一辆骑着方便。”顺手把车子上的钥匙一拔，车子上的锁就“咔”一下自动锁上了，我俩说着，走着，到了我的房子门前。
    我住的房子很矮小，墙壁是用席子夹成的，这是一个大房间隔成了三个小房间，我住在靠东面的一间里；怕冷，我在席子上不整齐的糊了些废报纸，看来就越觉着不美观，灯泡是二十五烛的，显得不很亮，生着一个小煤炉，屋子里既烟又不热。我先打开了门，请他进去，他第一声惊讶的说：“这还像话呀！这屋子怎么能过冬呢？住在这首都北京城，又是堂堂的大机关，住这样的房子？你就不觉着憋气？这个房子要拿到北京来说，就像是东单市场的‘经济理发馆’，要拿到咱们乡下来说，简直就是‘看瓜棚子’，这，这不像话呀！”
    因为他是久不见的客人，我不能马上严厉的斥责他这种说法，我只是笑嘻嘻的反驳了几句：“我对我这房子挺满意，小，暖和，除去光线不太好就没毛病，机关多，人多，都住好的，那里有那么多。”
    因为是多年不见的老同事来了，我应该好好的招待招待，说着我从抽屉里就取出一盒纸烟，抽出一支递给他，这纸烟是新发下的“七一”烟，烟丝是金黄的，抽起来很香，以前在解放区这算是上等烟哩！那时候人们都是拿着烟斗抽大叶，有时候一根纸烟几个人吸，像这样“七一”烟，不是每天都能抽到的，所以我一边给他递着烟一边说：“这是老边区‘七一’烟，一抽这烟就可以想到老边区啦！”他瞟了一眼，也没有说什么，只是摆了摆手，就从口袋里掏出一个粉红色带花纹的烟盒，烟盒上面还装置着个小巧的打火机，他打开取出来一支先递给了我说：“这个好，你尝尝吧！”我毫没客气：“好！就来你的吧！”我毫没客气：“好！就来你的！不过‘七一’烟就挺香！”他给我打着自来火，我使劲的吸了一口，还没有容得我说：“这个烟的确香！”他就先问了：“怎么样？好抽吧？”我说：“我这个烟瘾不大，冒烟就行。”说完我从箱子里取出我的烟斗来问他：“你还认得它吧？”他拿过去细细的端详着，这个烟斗是很粗劣的，假使把它抛在烂劈柴堆里，也许有人就认为它是块烂木头，连拾也不拾，可是谁又知道它还有一段光荣历史呢？在一九四四年，我们上山开荒种荞麦的时候，李进财＠出来一块枣木疙疸，这块木头长的就挺像个烟斗，一个大头，还带着一个尾巴，他把它送给了我，我拿回去花了几个游戏的时间，用小刀就把它挖成个烟斗的样子，又拿铁丝烫了一个孔，外面我还拿核桃油擦了个精亮，几年来，它帮助我作了不少的工作，当我工作疲倦了的时候，把它掏出来，不管是大叶、黄花、芝麻梗，都能过瘾，一连来上几锅子，马上精神就来啦，不过这几年磕磕碰碰，弄的它满身伤疤，可没以前那么漂亮了，特别这几天有了纸烟，我把它搁起来，上面还似乎有许多尘土。
    他端详完了说：“你这人真够保守，这玩艺还不扔它干嘛！是不是想拿到古玩店去当古玩呀？”我说：“倒不是想当古玩，可是我舍不得扔它，丢了几次，我都又把它找回来了，这会也不是没有，拿它抽烟头挺好，没有纸烟的时候还是它亲。”
    坐了一会，我开始问他是来干什么的，现在在哪儿住？作什么工作？
    我们还是由张家口出来以后分手的，至今才又见面，那时间他在团里当侦察参谋，年青，聪明，外号叫“机灵鬼”，虽说只是上过几天高小，可是入伍以后学习的知识很多，在团里的几个参谋里，他还是个能干的，这人就是爱出风头。那年他们团打王庄，他立了一大功，立功倒是好，可是他见人就说，总要表示他在侦察工作上如何的有办法，说他侦察的好是打下王庄的唯一条件，生怕有一个人不知道他立了功。这样使得人家都讨厌他，再加上他生活上不检点，总是那么爱漂亮，跟人家一样发的衣裳，他要改成马裤，钢笔不管能使不能使，小口袋上一带就是两三支，怀表上的钢练子总是外面露着半尺多长，在胸脯上晃来晃去，像小娃带的银锁一样，他自己觉着挺美，可是别人一见就撇嘴，他又爱聊天，一聊起来除了他的“过五关斩六将”，就是吃吃喝喝的事，那个酒铺有新到的好白干呀，那个饭馆里有熏鸡呀，因为他好这些，所以他看别人的时候，也是特别着重这些事，谁谁谁凭什么多领了一床被子！谁谁谁有病，上级就给他批大米？这个机关的房子好，那个单位吃的细粮多，这些消息他最灵通，他一说这些话，别人就说他：“勿怪你是个侦察参谋呀？”我们分手的头几天，因为他把公家发的棉衣拆成了夹衣，参谋长批评了他一顿，他撅着嘴背地里说：“这么点小事又是制度啦！又是节约啦！不想想打王庄是谁侦察的，没有我，你参谋长再指挥的高明也是干瞪眼，里面缴获那么多的枪炮子弹，大米白面，值钱的东西没数，我用这点破棉花又成了制度啦！”从那以后，听说还受到处分。总也没有入党。填了几次表，支部都没有通过。
    我问：“你怎么穿起这样的衣裳啦？”
    他很得意的说：“咱这会是干公安局的差事，前方跑了这么几年腿，也该到后方歇歇啦！”
    我说：“说该也不该，我们好几个野战军，不是还在进军吗？你不一定是这么简单，想到那就到那儿吧？”
    这他才告诉我，他在天津养病，身体很坏，上级为了照顾他的身体，就介绍他在天津地方工作。
    我正准备打听一下天津那里的情形，可是他先来问我了：“你们现在是什么制呀？每月能拿多少钱？”
    我说：“还是跟过去一样的‘制’，到什么时候发什么，每月拿几个钱可以买烟抽。”
    他继续说：“说起来我们比你们强点，我们是‘包干制’，除了吃，每月可以剩几十斤米，可是这口气也挺难平，一个机关里就分好几等，有的比咱差事小，可是人家‘薪津制’，一到发钱的时候，眼看着人家一拿多少万，咱他妈剩几个钱，连一件成样的东西也买不了，可是要论工作，咱就得作模范，上班的时候人家来啦，下班的时候人家走啦，咱一天住在机关里，半夜里有了事，你也不能不起来办呀，看起来咱这老革命还不如新革命？”
    我觉得他的思想大成问题，我马上反问他道：“你说什么不如？是说不如人家地位高，不如人家挣钱多，不如人家吃的好吗？咱参加革命难道是为了个人地位，为了个人的物质享受吗？”
    “那当然不是，”他说，“可是出的力大，得的报酬就该多，难道咱这老革命还没有他们新革命贡献大吗？我看就不合理。”
    “老李”我说：“咱们过去一块儿工作过，彼此相熟，不妨直说吧！我觉得动不动就夸耀自己什么功绩是错误的。咱们今天能够不糊里糊涂过日子，还不是在革命的教育下才有了今天吗？怎么能自己居起功来？我们革命的队伍愈扩大，参加建设的人才愈多，不是更加有利于人民国家建设的发展吗？”
    我看了进财一眼，又耐心的说：“你好好儿想一想！你这个想法是从什么利益出发”
    李进财不作声。我又接着说：“咱们战争还没有结束，生产建设决不是十天八天的事，咱们还谈不到享受，还要艰苦节约，渡过这个难关。咱们要坚持‘吃苦在先，享受在后’的作风，不计较地位和物质待遇，全心全意献身革命……”
    李进财低头沉思着。
    我真觉得他这种错误思想很危险，我又想起他到底是来北京作什么呢？决不会是为来看我的，一定还有别的缘故，我就问了他一下：“来这还办别的事吗？”
    他很不高兴的说：“别提啦，提起来气的慌，我是来送我老婆跟小孩的。”我听说老婆小孩也来了，外边又那么冷，就急速的问他：“她们呢？怎么不叫她们进来呢？”他说：“我是送到家又回来了，在家呆了三天，真把人恶心死，老婆是个封建娘们，还有个孩子；叫她出来工作吧？斗大的字识不了半升，离了婚吧，组织上又不准。”
    我说：“怎么能想到离婚呢？孩子都有了，我见过，你那个媳妇不错，地道的庄稼妇女，老实，勤劳，挺好。”
    他并没有管我这些话，而是照他要说的次序说下去：“一月以前她就去天津找我了，那个狼狈劲呀，真像个逃难的，咱怎么敢叫她见人呀，那个土气就别提，连沙发也不敢坐，出街转一个圈，就找不回大门来，他可给我眼皮子底下潦了块病，局长还说：‘来一次不容易，多住几天吧，领着她逛逛，要不是咱们胜利了，咱穷人家谁进的起城呀！’他也不想想，这么块宝贝怎么叫我拿得出去，我怎么能领着她到街上逛逛呢？我还要面子哩！我嫌丢人，这回算把她安置到家里啦，没有希望离婚，我也不希望再见她，我告诉她在家修行着吧！”
    这一片话使我愤恨了，我感到李进财变得好可怕！他这样无情的对待他的妻子，污辱谩骂这个善良的劳动妇女，简直有些堕落到丧失立场的地步！我这时虽然还照顾他是个客人的情面，但我愤慨的心使我的声音急燥了：“那你以前为什么跟人家结婚呢？不是人家找你的吧？那时候你们是自由恋爱的，这会你又看着人家不顺眼啦！将来你还想怎么着呢？”
    “那时候是那时候呀！当然那时候是看着她好，不过那也是比较的，没有朱砂，红土子就为贵，在乡村里来比，她还算可以，可是这会……”
    我抢着说：“这会怎么，这会你又看见大摩登啦！这是个严重的问题，离婚是可以，那得有正当理由，想不干了就散伙那不行，再说你不能过河拆桥，坚持这几年的战斗的，不是就是咱这些土里土气的农民吗？土就技丢人吗？你是说一天打扮得跟妖怪似的，光吃不做的人光荣吗？”
    “我倒不是说她丢人，是我觉着怪不好意思，看她不顺眼。”
    “那是你变了，你有毛病，人家并没有变，你觉着不满足啦，我看你这个媳妇很好，没有什么理由离婚！”
    炉子里的火熊熊的燃烧着，红绿火苗交织成一朵鲜红的牡丹花，我们虽不是吵嘴，因为谁也没有脸红，但对这问题的认识上，意见是分歧的，所以许多应该问的话也忘记了问，两个人都沉默起来了。
    正在这个时候，门房老头又来喊了：“张志民！又有人找，去看看吧！”我知道星期日是会有朋友们来玩的，这就使我想到一定不是公事，所以就请李进财同志等我，回来再谈。
    边走我边问门房老头：“是个什么样子的人呀？”他告诉我：“是个架着拐子的”，我心里“扑通”一跳！我不能一时想到我的朋友谁拐了，就急忙的加快脚步赶到门口去。
    门口的电灯明起来了，明得那么耀眼，我老远的看去，就像我八九年前的老战友王强，我们是五六年不见了，我亲热的抢上去抱住他，因为他两条拐子没有吃力，差一点儿给摔倒，当时，我什么也想不起来问他，我只是惊讶的指着他的腿说：“这，怎么啦？”他的神色平静极了，他说：“这没什么，快好啦！”我又问，这也是我一定要连续问到的：“这不会……？”他急忙说：“不会残废的！”我要扶着他走进去，他不叫，并且叫我走在前面，他还是那么乐观的说：“这几个月在医院里把武艺练好了，架着这对拐子能追自行车。”我笑了觉得他这种夸大了的说法很有趣不过他三窜两蹦就跑到我前面去了，也的确是快！
    进屋，我还没有介绍，他们两个早已认识。王强当教导员的时候，李进财在他的营里当副连长，说来还是个上下级的关系，所以李进财忙的站起来让了个坐，看来像有几分拘束的样子，我把凳子倒放下，上面放了块棉垫，这样可以使他坐得舒服点，他熟练的把两条拐子向凳子上一靠，一条左腿笔直的平放在拐子上，就又取笑的告诉我们：“这个动作也是新学的。”
    笑了，我们都笑了！笑着使我开始了回忆，王强跟他的名子一样，就是挺坚强，三十王六岁，知识分子出身，是一九三八年到延安抗大学习，出校以后始终作部队工作，政治工作搞的好，打仗也是个好将，平汉线战役时，他当教导员，营长牺牲了，他指挥一营人消灭了敌人完成任务，战士们没有不说王教导员是文武双全的。要说生活作风，也是很艰苦的，行军有马总是给病号骑，就那个枣红白蹄小马，战士们都挺熟悉它的脾气，你要说这马是王教导员的，他们就会给你校正过来：“这马是病号的。”战士们给他写了稿子表扬他，报纸上发表的晚了点，可把战士们急坏了，都说：“我们的搞子登不登倒没啥，教导员的好处不能不表扬呀！”王强给战士们解释说：“咱们好好的工作是应该尽的责任，还要什么表扬呢？要作不好了是你负的责任不好，那就对革命有影响，就应该受到批评。”这些旧印象又呈现在我的回忆里。
    在电灯下，我仔细的看他的样子是不是变了？是变了，他老了，眼角上深深的刻着像鸡爪子一样的一堆皱纹，这已经告诉了我，他这几年战斗的日子，我又更细心的看去，在他嘴角下添了一块杏核大的疤，这块疤的颜色是紫黑色的，我两眼死盯盯的看着，恨不得去用手摸摸，问问他现在还疼不疼？这时他说话了，他问：“你看这块疤吗？腿上还有，这是四五年的成绩，别处还好说，嘴上这块疤脸肿成了个油葫芦，嘴小的刚伸进筷子去，多少日子不能吃东西，就是看护员拿小勺灌点牛奶我算知道了，人这玩艺跟表一样，那个零件不好使了也不行。”
    又笑了，他逗得我们哄笑，我给他点支烟，他开始问李进财在哪工作？作什么？现在进步怎样？问完就告诉我们：“这次带花是在太原，下来以后在石家庄休养，腿上是炮弹炸伤，大小有七八处，因为负伤时泥土炸进伤口，伤口总也不好，动过五次手术，每次都要疼个半死，一直到现在还没有长严，不过不太要紧了，因为快好了，这才来北京看看，到了表兄家住，街上碰见熟人才知道你在这。”
    我为他来而高兴，也不知怎么来招待他了，只是他说到每一个情节时，我都像亲眼看到一样，我看到他负伤了，他痛得浑身哆嗦，但他又很倔强，他在医院里来休养了，动手术的刀子、剪子、血布，都在我眼里闪见了，我望望李进财的神色，有些害怕的样子，我想要是犯在他身上可不知道怎么样了。
    我取过暖壶，倒了一杯热水，递给王强，他小心的端着这个杯子，像是看得这水是多么珍贵呀！他指着暖壶说：“有这么个玩艺喝开水就方便多了，你这个能保温多少时间呀？”我说：“这是三元牌的，听说是保二十四小时，可是没有专意试过。”他又说：“水这东西就是宝贝，你别瞧大河里流着那么多，到了缺的时候，比香水精还贵，打太原多少日子喝不上开水，嗓子里干的冒烟，那时候想水一定比蜜还甜，多少日子摸不着洗脸，睡觉起来用唾沫湿湿眼角，擦擦眼屎污就行了。在庆功会上给功臣们庆功，不是敬酒，而是敬水，敬水还得有限制，不是：‘请你来杯吧！’而是：‘请你喝一口！’这会有暖壶使，真天堂，天堂！”
    我没有参加打太原，但当他说到这里时，使我想到抗战中反“扫荡”的时候，几天喝不上水，嘴里咽着唾沫，可是唾沫也不能管够的咽呀！咽完了也没有处找去，我们在一个山上石洞里，上面像珍珠的滴着水点，我把小碗接到下面，半天滴了一碗水，混的像咖啡一样颜色，就这碗“咖啡”，还是要发扬互助友爱，大家分着喝下去。
    这个身上还带着没有痊愈的伤的人，他说起话来可一点也不像有伤在身上，声音是那么响亮有力。他问道：“你认识刘云吧？”
    我说：“认识，小个，胖子，以前当连长。”
    “他比我早挂花一个月，很重，腿上穿了三颗机枪子弹，骨头断了，刚抬下来，医生说给他锯腿，他不叫锯，他说：‘死也要落下个全尸首。’后来伤口化脓，肉都变黑了，不锯性命就危险，这才劝着他锯了。这会伤口好了，缺了一条左腿，我来的时候，他到荣军学校去了。”
    我神经紧张了，脊背有点发凉，我恨，我知道我这个战友的左腿，是叫蒋介石这匪贼夺去了，他还夺了千千万万人的腿哩！
    他又说：“还有，还有贾中林，你知道吧?”
    我说：“知道，知道，咱们挺熟悉的，他怎么啦？”
    “他壮烈牺牲了！”
    他的声音变低了，嗓子有些嘶哑，在他那坚毅的眼里滚起了泪珠，我的眼睛一阵发酸，泪就“扑扑”的下来了，李进财也在抹眼睛，这时除去炉子上的小水壶在“嘶嘶”的响着，全屋子是寂静无声的。
    过了一会，王强又睁大他那眼睛，眼珠上不是黑白分明，而是橙红色的，他拍起大腿说：“全营战士听说营长贾中林牺牲了，肺都要气炸了，一致提出‘为贾营长复仇，打进太原去！’我带的是突击连，这腿就是在攻一个碉堡的时候负伤的。”
    李进财心里像是有什么事在折腾，他坐不稳了，在地下来去的踱着，有时皱一皱眉头，有时把头低下来。王强的话不就像是专门对他讲的吗？
    这时王强要走，我们都站起来了，我又问：“老王以后准备到那儿去工作？”
    他说：“我伤好利落了，还是找部队去，继续追击蒋匪彻底消灭敌人。这点伤算什么？掉了几块肉不是还能‘填平补齐’吗？”
    他说到这里，我忽然想起来一件事，我打开箱子取出来一个陈旧的日记本，急速的翻了几页，递给王强说：“你看，这是你一九四四年九月十二和我临别时给我写下的，同志，”我转向李进财：“你也看看！”李进财夺过去念着：“当你对于物质上享受感到不满足时，你应该回味过去的艰苦作风，当你为个人的利益而烦恼时，你应该提醒自己，我们献身革命，决不是为了个人的利益。我们只是为人民的利益而斗争，谁要是为个人打算，谁就会被人民抛弃！”李进财念完就把头低下了，像是在这两句话面前表示着惭愧。
    我送王强出去，李进财也要一块去，因为要赶火车去天津，所以我们三人就一块出去了，在我的前面，一个是年青的小伙子推着车，低着头，像是边走边想什么，他不像刚来时候那么浮燥了；另一个是架着双拐的伤员，他一跳一跳是那么有劲，在月光下看着他四条腿的影子在摇晃，我望着他们走得很远很远了。
    回到了我的房子里，火炉依然是熊熊的烧着，炉上的水壶还在“嘶嘶”的叫着，茶杯里是王强喝剩下的半杯水，地下掷着几个李进财吸了的烟头，一切都象客人刚走的样子。
    我闭上眼躺下了，并没有睡，这星期日晚上的情景，清楚的印在我的脑子里。
