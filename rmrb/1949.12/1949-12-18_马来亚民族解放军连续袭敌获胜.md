　　Malayan National Liberation Army
  　Continuously Attacks and Wins Victories Against the Enemy
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: The Malayan Freedom News, published on November 1st, announced the continuous victories of the Malayan National Liberation Army. At midnight on May 8th this year, the 3rd Detachment of Northern Johore attacked the Jishan United Rubber Plantation in Jasin, Malacca, forcing the British troops to surrender their weapons. On August 26th, the guerrillas ambushed British troops on the Senawang-Pilin Road in central Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, seriously wounding the Chief of Police and the Deputy Labor Secretary of Negeri Sembilan (both British), killing two British military officers and five policemen, and seizing many new rifles, bullets, and other spoils of war. The 8th and 10th Detachments and others have also won victories in various parts of northern Kedah and central Pahang, Malaya.
    The spokesperson for the Headquarters of the 6th Detachment of the Malayan National Liberation Army (Western Pahang), in summarizing a year of combat from June 20th of last year to June 20th of this year, pointed out: Although the British troops have continuously carried out frantic and cruel offensives against the guerrillas, the guerrillas have repelled the enemy and have taken the initiative to attack the British troops. In one year, the 6th Detachment fought the British troops forty times, killing, wounding, and capturing 157 enemy regular soldiers and police (including 21 British soldiers and British police Deputy Superintendents, Air Force Majors, police officers, etc.), seizing 88 various types of guns and 1,977 bullets, eliminating 125 enemy agents and informants (many of whom were Kuomintang reactionaries), and destroying many enemy rubber plantations, locomotives, and police stations. These achievements are due, on the one hand, to the heroic fighting of the guerrilla fighters, and on the other hand, to the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people, especially the workers and peasants.
    According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Singapore: On the morning of the 12th of this month, guerrillas of the Malayan National Liberation Army attacked a police jungle unit in Negeri Sembilan, central Malaya, killing 16 and wounding 9. The guerrillas also destroyed three police vehicles.

　　马来亚民族解放军
  　连续袭敌获胜
    【新华社北京十六日电】十一月一日出版的马来亚自由报，公布了马来亚民族解放军不断获得胜利的战果。本年五月八日午夜，柔佛北部第三支队袭击马六甲野新吉山联合树胶园，英军被迫缴械投降。八月二十六日，游击队向马六甲中部森美兰庇＠文积路之英军伏击，结果重伤森州总警察署长及副劳工司（均英人），击毙英籍军官二人及警察五人，缴获不少新式枪支、子弹和其他战利品，如第八支队和第十支队等，在马来亚北部吉打、中部彭亨各地，都分别获胜。
    马来亚民族解放军第六支队（彭亨西部）司令部发言人在总结从去年六月二十日到今年六月二十日为止的一年战斗时指出：英军虽不断向游击队实行疯狂残酷的进攻，但游击队打退了敌人，并主动袭击英军。第六支队在一年中与英军作占四十次，毙、伤、俘敌正规军警一百五十七名（包括英兵二十一名以及英籍警察副监、空军少校、警官等）缴获各式枪支八十八支，子弹一千九百七十七发，消灭敌走狗情报员一百二十五名（内有许多是国民党反动分子），破坏敌人的许多树胶园、火车头、警察局。这些成绩，一方面是游击战士英勇奋战的结果，另一方面是因为得到广大人民特别是工农群众的热烈支持。
    另据法新社新加坡消息：本月十二日晨马来亚民族解放军游击部队在马来亚中部森美兰州袭击一警察丛林部队，击毙十六人，伤九人。游击队并毁坏警察队的汽车三辆。
