　　The South Korean people, under the military occupation of U.S. imperialism and the brutal suppression of the Lee Syngman puppet regime, have not only never ceased their struggle, but have increasingly developed it into armed uprisings.

　　The uprising on Jeju Island, the largest island in Korea with a population of 300,000, began in April of last year. The cause of the uprising was the Seoul authorities' attempt to force the island's farmers to pay rent on privately owned land. When Korea was liberated from Japanese colonial slavery, the farmers reclaimed their land, but the reactionary Seoul authorities considered this action illegal and demanded that they hand over half of their harvest as rent. The farmers refused to comply with this demand, and the reactionary Seoul authorities ordered the police to drive the farmers off these lands and confiscate their entire harvest. This aroused public outrage among all the island's residents. The farmers rose up, destroyed all the police stations on the island, arrested all the officials of the reactionary Seoul authorities, and established their own government on the island. When the U.S. occupation authorities held separate sham elections in South Korea in May of last year, all the residents of Jeju Island resolutely refused to participate. U.S. imperialism dispatched a police battalion, commanded by U.S. officers and equipped with machine guns and field artillery, to attack the island. However, this not only failed to intimidate the residents of Jeju, but the guerrillas led several so-called "punitive expeditions" into the mountains, defeated them, and armed themselves with the captured enemy weapons. In order to suppress the guerrillas operating in the mountains of the island, U.S. imperialism repeatedly dispatched aircraft. The "punitive expeditions" were ordered to trample all the crops on the island in order to torment the insurgents with famine. However, despite these measures by U.S. imperialism, the guerrilla movement quickly spread to other provinces of South Korea.

　　Under the blows of the insurgent people, the "punitive expeditions" established by U.S. imperialism were greatly shaken. Because Lee Syngman, in accordance with the wishes of the U.S. authorities, implemented forced mobilization, the working people who were mobilized, after obtaining weapons, began to mutiny en masse and join the guerrillas. In October of last year, several units of the South Korean army launched uprisings, with more than 4,000 officers and soldiers participating. About 1,500 people were arrested by the Lee Syngman puppet government for participating in this uprising, and several hundred of them have been shot. However, most of the insurgent soldiers eventually safely joined the guerrillas. At the end of last year, an entire regiment in the puppet army defected to the side of the insurgent people. Cases of police forces joining the guerrillas were frequently heard. On May 5th of this year, two battalions of the 8th Regiment of Gangwon Province revolted, and together with their commanders and fully armed, they went to North Korea. Five days later, a warship of the South Korean fleet followed their example. The entire crew of the ship launched an uprising and sailed the warship into Wonsan Port in North Korea. There have also been several instances of aircraft flying from South Korea to North Korea.

　　The South Korean guerrillas, with their heroic struggle and the support of the broad masses of the people, have increasingly expanded and consolidated their ranks. As soon as the guerrilla队伍 entered residential areas, it was immediately supplemented by volunteers. In Jeolla South Province and Gyeongsang North Province alone, from July 20th to 30th of this year, 785 people joined the guerrillas; throughout South Korea, from August 1st to 10th of this year, 3,382 people joined the guerrillas.

　　The strength of the guerrillas has also increased daily, and they have repeatedly defeated the puppet army. For example, on September 21st of this year, in Jeolla South Province, the guerrillas attacked and annihilated a police team; in the Hamhung and Hognam (transliteration) areas, the guerrillas defeated two police teams. A large guerrilla force active in the Baewang Mountain (transliteration) area attacked a battalion of the South Korean army, defeated them, and captured their officers and seized a large number of weapons.

　　According to statistics from the Democratic Korea newspaper, the guerrilla movement has now spread to 77 counties and 283 villages in South Korea. In the eight areas controlled by the guerrillas, people's committees have been established and land reform has been implemented. With the exception of large cities, all the territories and settlements in Jeolla South Province and Gyeongsang South Province are actually under the control of the guerrillas. The guerrillas active in Goheung, Boseong, Hwasun, Naju, Hampyeong, Suncheon and other counties attacked police stations, arrested and expelled the running dogs of the Lee Syngman puppet government, and helped to establish their own local government organs. The residents of these areas warmly support the guerrillas, causing all attempts by the Lee Syngman clique to suppress the guerrilla movement to fail.

### 如火燎原的南朝鲜人民武装斗争

　　如火燎原的南朝鲜人民武装斗争
    南朝鲜人民在美帝军事占领及李砂晚伪的残暴镇压下，不仅没有停止过斗争，而且日益发展为武装起义的行动。
    在拥有三十万人口的朝鲜这个最大海岛——济州岛上的起义，是在去年四月开始的。起义的原因是汉城当局企图迫使该岛农民缴纳私有土地的地租。当朝鲜从日本殖民地奴役下获得解放后，农民收回了自己的土地，可是汉城反动当局却认为农民的这种行动是非法的，并要他们拿一半收成作为地租，农民们拒绝执行这种要求，汉城反动当局遂命令警察将农民从这些地段上赶走并没收全部收成，这引起了该岛全体居民的公愤，农民们起来捣毁了岛上的一切警察局，逮捕了汉城反动当局的所有官吏并在岛上建立了自己的政权。当去年五月美占领军当局在南朝鲜单独举行伪选时，济州岛的全体居民就坚决拒绝参加。美帝派遣了由美国军官指挥的、配备有机关枪和野战炮的警察大队实行向该岛进攻，但是这不仅没有吓倒济州居民，而且游击队曾把几个所谓“讨伐队”引进了山地，并把他们击溃，和缴获了敌人的武器武装了自己。为了镇压该岛山地活动的游击队，美帝曾屡次出动了飞机。“讨伐队”曾得到命令将该岛所有庄稼践踏净尽，以便用饥馑来折磨起义者。然而尽管美帝使用这些手段，游击运动却很快扩展到南朝鲜的其他省份。
    在起义人民的打击下，由美帝成立的“讨伐队”大大动摇起来，由于李承晚按照美当局的意旨，施行强制动员，被动员去的劳动人民，得到武器后，便开始大批的哗变参加游击队，去年十月间南朝鲜军的几个部队发动起义，参加的官兵计有四千多人。因为参加此次起义而被李承晚傀儡政府逮捕了的约有一千五百多人，其中有几百人已被枪杀。然而大多数起义士兵终于安全投入了游击队。去年年底，傀儡军中曾有一个整团转到起义人民方面去。警察队伍投到游击队方面去的事日有所闻。今年五月五号江原省第八团的两营起义了，他们同自己的指挥官并带着全副武装开到北朝鲜。五天以后，南朝鲜舰队的某一艘军舰也仿效了他们。该舰的全体船员发动起义并把军舰开进了北朝鲜的元山港。飞机从南朝鲜飞往北朝鲜的事情也有几次。
    南朝鲜的游击队，随着自己的英勇斗争和广大民的支援，日益扩大和巩固了自己的队伍。当游击队的队伍刚刚进入居民区，它马上就补充了志愿军。只在全罗南道和庆尚北道，从今年七月二十日到三十日就有七百八十五人加入游击队；整个南朝鲜，从今年八月一日到十日有三千三百八十二人加入游击队。
    游击队的力量也日渐增强，他们屡次击败了傀儡军队。象今年九月二十一日，在全罗南道游击队袭击并消灭了警察队，在咸兴和霍南（译音）区游击队击溃了两个警察队，活跃在八王山（译音）山区的一支庞大的游击队，袭击了南朝鲜军队的一个营，击溃了他们，并捕获了他们的官长和缴获了大批的武器。
    据民主朝鲜报的统计，目前游击运动普及了南朝鲜的七十七县和二百八十三村。在游击队控制的八个区域内，成立了人民委员会并实行了土地改革，除开大城市以外，全罗南道和庆尚南道的全部地盘和居民点实际上都在游击队的控制之下。在高兴、补线、何胜、罗州、黄平、顺天和其他等县活动的游击队、袭击警察局，逮捕和驱逐李承晚伪政府的走卒，并帮助成立自己的地方政权机关。这些区域的居民热烈地支持游击队，使李承晚之流镇压游击运动的一切企图都归失败。
