　　Preparing to Purchase Victory Bonds
    Wuhan and Qingdao Hold Symposiums
    [Our Newspaper Hankou Dispatch, 22nd] The Yangtze River Daily here invited representatives from all sectors of Wuhan to a symposium on the 22nd. Representatives from industry and commerce believed that the issuance of bonds would help overcome difficulties and restore and prosper the economy as soon as possible, which is indeed in line with their own interests. The term is not too long, and the repayment with interest adjusted for inflation is even more beneficial to purchasers. They said: Comparing the three methods of issuing currency, increasing taxes, and issuing bonds to make up for the national fiscal deficit, issuing bonds is the best and most responsible to the people. Our industry and commerce have an unshirkable duty to do our best to subscribe.
    Currently, industry and commerce have already proposed to subscribe first, and some are preparing to compete for the first issue. Worker representatives said: Although we cannot afford to buy much, we will definitely purchase widely. Student representatives said: We must first mobilize our fathers to buy. Representatives from the China Democratic League also stated: In the past, the Kuomintang issued private bonds, but now they are true public bonds, and even if we have difficulties, we must subscribe. The meeting also proposed the establishment of a Wuhan All-Circles Committee for Promoting the People's Victory Bonds to carry out extensive publicity and promotion work.
    [Our Newspaper Qingdao Dispatch, 22nd] All sectors of Qingdao City are widely discussing and deliberating the Central People's Government's Victory Bond Regulations. Seamen and ship repair workers have already begun subscribing. In the workers' symposium, the speeches were extremely enthusiastic. They unanimously believed that the government's difficulties today are the difficulties of the working class and the people of the whole country. Wang Maochang, an employee of the China Merchants Bureau, said: The purpose of this Victory Bond is to concentrate idle funds to stabilize prices and rapidly restore and develop production to ensure the lives of the people of the whole country. Bi Shuyuan and Liu Guoqing said: The issuance of the Victory Bond is the Central People's Government's plan for the people of the whole country. Even if there is no interest, we should try our best to take out money to help the government overcome the current difficulties. Currently, the Qingdao industrial and commercial sectors are also deliberating.

　　准备购买胜利公债
    武汉青岛举行座谈
    【本报汉口二十二日专电】此间长江日报于二十二日特邀请武汉市各界代表举行座谈。工商界代表认为这次发行公债能渡过困难，早日恢复和繁荣经济，确与自己本身利益相结合。在期限上也不算长，同时折实加息偿还，对购买者更为有利。他们说：以后发行货币，增加税收，发行公债三种弥补国家财政赤字的方法作比较，发行公债是最好的，最对人民负责的。我们工商界义不容辞，要尽力认购。
    现工商界已经提出要首先认购，并有人准备争购第一号。职工代表说：我们虽无力多买，但一定会普遍购买。学生代表说：我们首先要动员自己的爸爸购买。民盟代表也表示：过去国民党发行的是私债，现在是真正的公债，即使我们有困难也要认购。会上并提出成立武汉各界推销人民胜利折实公债委员会，进行广泛宣传和推销工作。
    【本报青岛二十二日专电】青岛市各界广泛的展开酝酿与讨论中央人民政府的胜利公债条例。海员修船职工已开始认购。在工人座谈中，发言极为热烈，一致认为今天政府的困难，就是工人阶级和全国人民的困难。招商局职工王茂常说：这次胜利公债的目的是集中游资稳定物价，迅速恢复与发展生产，以保障全国人民的生活。毕庶元、刘国卿说：胜利公债的发行，是中央人民政府为全国人民作打算，就是不给利息，也应尽量拿出钱来帮助政府克服眼前的困难。现青市工商界亦正酝酿中。
