　　Through Various Forms of Production
  　Two Thousand Housewives in Nanjing are Organized
　　[Our Newspaper] The preparatory work of the Nanjing Municipal Women's Federation is developing vigorously. To date, the number of housewives united around the Women's Federation has increased to more than two thousand. Since the establishment of the preparatory committee of the Home Women's Federation, scattered housewives have been organized into mutual aid groups according to the distance of the area through various production methods such as shoemaking and sewing sock soles. All production work is carried out in units of groups. In order to absorb experience, the preparatory committee of the Home Women's Federation decided to focus on the Second District (Daxing Palace, Taiping Road area), where there is a relatively good mass base and a concentration of housewives, and assigned three working cadres to assist the women's work cadres of the district office in carrying out the organizational work of housewives. According to each person's work skills, different types of production mutual aid groups and life mutual aid groups are organized to closely unite the scattered housewives on the production mutual aid front.

　　通过各种生产形式
  　南京市家庭妇女二千人组织起来
    【本报讯】南京市家庭妇联筹委会的工作正蓬勃的开展，到目前为止，团结在妇联周围的家庭妇女已增至两千余人。自家庭妇联筹委会成立以来，即通过各种生产方式，如制鞋、缝袜底等，将分散的家庭妇女按地区的远近分别组织成为互助小组，一切生产工作都以小组为单位。家庭妇联筹委会，为吸取经验，决定以群众基础较好的家庭妇女较集中的二区（大行宫、太平路一带）作为中心，配备了三个工作干部下去，协助区公所的妇女工作干部，进行家庭妇女组织工作。并根据每人工作技能，分别组织不同性质的生产互助小组以及生活互助小组，把散漫的家庭妇女们在生产互助阵线上紧密的团结起来。
