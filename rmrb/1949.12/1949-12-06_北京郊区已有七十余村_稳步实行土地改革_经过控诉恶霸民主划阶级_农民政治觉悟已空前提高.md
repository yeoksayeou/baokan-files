　　Beijing Suburbs, December 5th (This Newspaper) After living under the yoke of feudal emperors, bureaucratic landlords for a long time, the 600,000 farmers in the suburbs of Beijing began to implement the land reform movement to overthrow the feudal system a few months after liberation. The first batch of more than 70 villages to carry out land reform, under the leadership of the land reform work team of the Suburban Work Committee, has, over the past month, carried out publicity on policies, sorted out and organized the masses' ranks, accused local bullies, and divided class components, and is about to confiscate the land of the feudal landlord class. The land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing started at the end of October. In mid-October, each district convened a meeting of farmer representatives to discuss the policy of land reform in the suburbs, learn how to divide classes, and study working methods and steps. After the meeting, 65 work teams composed of more than 500 cadres from the Suburban Work Committee went to the countryside to lead the land reform work in a planned and step-by-step manner. There are a total of 260 administrative villages in the suburbs of Beijing. The land reform of all villages is planned to be completed in three batches over a period of four and a half months.
    The characteristics of the suburbs of Beijing are: a large population and little land, with most of the land concentrated in the hands of a few feudal landlord classes. This feudal land ownership not only restricts the development of agricultural production, but also directly hinders the construction of the city and the development of industry and commerce. According to the characteristics of the rural areas in the suburbs of Beijing, the Beijing Military Control Commission issued the "Decision on Agricultural Land Issues in the Municipality's Jurisdiction" in May, which made basic regulations on the policy of land reform in the suburbs. After several months of experimentation in several villages by the Suburban Committee, the policy spirit has become clearer and preliminary experience has been gained; further supplements have also been made to some specific issues. The current policy of land reform in the suburbs is: to confiscate the land of the feudal landlord class and return it to the state, which will be distributed to farmers for use at the state's discretion. For landlords who rely on land for their livelihood, a portion of land roughly equivalent to that of an ordinary middle peasant should be reserved when confiscating land. For the evil bullies whose crimes are heinous and hated by the broad masses, the masses should be led to conduct organized accusation struggles, but indiscriminate detention, beatings, or other disguised corporal punishment are strictly prohibited. Those who need to be punished and sentenced must be sentenced by the court according to law. It is also clearly stipulated that industry and commerce should be protected, middle peasants should not be touched, and farmland and horticulture with progressive facilities rented out by landlords should still be used by the original tillers.
    After each work team arrived in the village at the end of October, they cooperated with the farmer representatives who had attended the meeting in the district to widely publicize the policies and investigate and understand the situation. Due to the victorious situation of the whole country and the influence of land reform in the old liberated areas, as well as the gradual improvement of farmers' awareness after liberation, everyone's demand for eliminating feudalism is very urgent. In some villages, after one or two mass rallies, the masses accused the local bullies of their crimes. For the evil bullies and local despots whose crimes were heinous and were indeed hated by the broad masses, the work team conducted grievance-telling or accusation meetings based on the demands of the masses. Those who must be punished were reported to the court for their crimes and sentenced according to law. Among the first batch of more than 70 villages to carry out land reform, after 21 villages carried out anti-local bully struggles, the masses were thoroughly liberated politically, gained democratic rights, and were in high spirits, and then turned to class division. In another part of the villages, the masses demanded to divide classes and adjust land first. The work team then led the farmers to study class division in groups. When farmers learned to tentatively divide their own classes, the work team went deep to understand the situation of the farmers' association, adjusted cadres, sorted out, expanded the farmers' association or established a farmers' representative meeting. For the determination of class components, each village underwent about half a month of investigation and research and democratic evaluation. In the division of classes, the class consciousness of farmers was raised by combining it with grievance-telling, breaking some farmers' feudal superstitious views that "poverty and wealth are determined by heaven." At the class division meetings in some villages, farmers righteously reasoned and struggled against the landlords who attempted to conceal and falsely report, so that most landlords could honestly report themselves and bow their heads to the farmers. Because farmers in the suburbs generally have a higher level of education and many village cadres are literate, it is easier to grasp the standards for class division, and the division of general components can be more accurate, but for some people who occupy and rent out land in rural areas and also engage in industry and commerce or other occupations in cities, errors sometimes occur due to the complexity of the situation. In this regard, the Suburban Committee has specific measures to instruct each district. In addition, due to the large population and little land in the suburbs, farmers also have the phenomenon of deliberately raising their components in order to obtain sufficient land. The work teams in each district have paid attention to preventing and correcting this. The components of each village were determined through democratic discussion and finalized in three announcements. When announcing the last announcement, it must be reviewed and approved by the district committee. If the district committee still has doubts about the component of a household and cannot confirm it, it must report to the Suburban Committee in a timely manner for further research and review. At present, the class components of most villages are nearing final approval, and some villages have begun to adjust land after determining the components.

　　北京郊区已有七十余村
    稳步实行土地改革
  　经过控诉恶霸民主划阶级
    农民政治觉悟已空前提高
    【本报讯】长久生活在封建帝王、官僚地主脚下的北京郊区六十万农民，在解放数月后，即已开始实行推翻封建制度的土地改革运动。第一批进行土地改革的七十多个村庄，在郊区工作委员会土地改革工作组的领导下，一个月来，经过宣传政策，整理与组织群众的队伍，控诉恶霸和划分阶级成份，并即将进行没收封建地主阶级的土地。北京郊区的土地改革工作是从十月底开始的。十月中旬，各区曾分别召开了农民代表会，讨论郊区土地改革的政策，学习划阶级，研究工作方法与步骤。会后，由郊区工作委员会五百余干部所组成的六十五个工作组即分别到达农村，有计划、有步骤地领导土地改革工作。北京郊区共二百六十个行政村，所有村庄的土地改革，计划以四个半月时间分三批完成。
    北京郊区的特点是：人多地少，大部分土地集中在少数封建地主阶级手里。这种封建的土地占有，不仅束缚着农业生产的发展，且直接妨碍城市的建设及工商业的发展。根据京市郊区农村的特点，北京市军管会在五月所颁布的“本市辖区农业土地问题的决定”中，对郊区土地改革的政策已作了基本的规定，后经郊委几个月来在数村进行实验，对政策精神已更加明确，并获得了初步的经验；对某些具体问题亦作了进一步的补充。目前郊区土地改革的方针是：没收封建地主阶级之土地归国家所有，由国家酌量分配给农民使用。对依靠土地为生的地主，在没收土地时应留予大体相当于普通中农之一份土地。对罪大恶极为广大群众所痛恨的恶霸分子，应领导群众进行有组织的控诉斗争，但严禁乱扣乱打或其他变相肉刑，对需要处刑和判罪者，须由法院依法判处。并明确规定；保护工商业，不动中农，对于地主出租的有进步设施的农田及园艺仍归原耕用者使用。
    在十月底各工作组到村后，即配合曾在区上开会的农民代表，广泛宣传政策，调查了解情况。由于全国的胜利形势和老解放区土地改革的影响，以及解放后农民觉悟的逐渐提高，大家对消灭封建的要求甚为迫切。有的村经过一两次大会宣传后，群众即控诉恶霸的罪行。对罪大恶极，确实为广大群众所痛恨的恶霸地主当权派，工作组即根据群众要求，进行诉苦说理或控诉大会。对于必须处刑的，将其罪状呈报法院，依法判处。在第一批进行土改的七十余村中，有二十一个村先后进行了反恶霸后，群众在政治上彻底翻身，获得了民主权利、情绪高昂，即转入划阶级。另一部分村子，群众要求先划阶级和调剂土地。工作组即领导农民分组学习划阶级。当农民学习试划自己的阶级时，工作组深入了解农会情况，进行调整干部，整理、扩大农会或成立农民代表会。对划订阶级成份，各村均经过半月左右的调查研究，民主评议。在划阶级中，结合诉苦，提高农民的阶级觉悟，打破某些农民认为“穷富由天定”的封建迷信观点。在有些村的划阶级大会上，农民对企图隐瞒虚报的地主，理直气壮地进行说理斗争，使在多数地主都能老实自报，向农民低头。因郊区农民一般文化程度较高，很多村干部都识字，对划阶级标准较易掌握，对一般成份的划订都能比较正确，但对一部分在农村占有和出租土地而又在城市经营工商业或进行其他职业者的成份，因情形复杂，有时也发生错误。对此，郊委已有具体办法指示各区。另外，因郊区人多地少，农民为获得足够的土地，也有故意提高成份的现象。各区工作组已注意防止和纠正。各村对划订成份，均经民主讨论，三榜定案。在公布最后一榜时，并需经过区委审查批准。区委对某户成份仍有疑问而不能肯定时，需及时报告郊委，作更进一步的研究审核。现大部分村的阶级成份已将近最后审定，并有部分村庄在确定成份后已开始进行调剂土地。
