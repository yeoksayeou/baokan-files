　　Northeast Military Region, a Certain Regiment
    Soldiers Study Culture Intensively
  　Leaders Pay Close Attention; No More Illiterate Soldiers Nationwide.
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Due to the emphasis placed by the leadership and the efforts of the soldiers, cultural learning in a certain regiment of the Northeast Military Region Garrison and a certain regiment of the Chahar Military Region has progressed rapidly. A certain regiment of the Northeast Military Region has been focusing on cultural learning during the recent four months of military training. The comrades in the entire regiment who were illiterate have learned at least a hundred characters. Most have learned two or three hundred characters, and those who know more than four hundred characters account for five percent; from June to now, 278 people in the entire regiment have been promoted from Group C to Group B, and 147 people have been promoted from Group B to Group A. In a certain regiment of the Chahar Military Region, only about ten percent are still illiterate. During three months of study, 230 people learned to read newspapers, and 145 people learned to write letters and write wall posters.
    The soldiers are extremely enthusiastic about learning. During breaks from training, voluntary labor, and extracurricular activities, they take out their notebooks from their pockets to study; on Saturdays, they also seek out cultural instructors to learn a few new characters. They generally save their allowances to buy stationery. According to statistics from a certain regiment of the Chahar Military Region, in three months, the entire regiment added 797 fountain pens and 479 pencils, with each person having an average of one study notebook and one pen. Zhao Shengyue of the Youth Company even subscribed to a newspaper with his own allowance for everyone to study. Challenges and competitions were launched between classes and individuals, and wall posters regularly reported learning achievements and experiences, creating a wave of learning. The creation of this learning upsurge is inseparable from the leadership's emphasis on soldiers' learning. A certain regiment of the Northeast Military Region held a meeting of all cultural instructors and, based on the reports, promptly clarified thinking among administrative cadres, correcting the tendency of cadres at all levels to underestimate cultural education, such as squeezing public errands and duties into cultural class time, suspending cultural classes for cleaning and hygiene, and not checking attendance during cultural classes. A roll call system was established, requiring attendance to be checked in each class; each group was required to report on time, and regular checks were conducted. In terms of learning, it was stipulated that new characters must be written in each lesson, and a review must be conducted every eight hours of instruction, allowing soldiers to silently write new characters and practice writing compositions and making sentences; exams were given once a month, and results were announced monthly. The regiment's propaganda and education section held a cultural education preparation meeting every week to arrange specific progress, study teaching methods, and conduct monthly inspections in each company, with commendations and criticisms issued through circulars. The leadership of a certain regiment of the Chahar Military Region grasped the learning situation, first classifying classes according to different levels, hiring instructors for each class, with the central instructors of each battalion grasping the cultural learning of the entire battalion, adhering to the learning system and frequently convening meetings according to the teaching progress to study learning methods and progress. Examination systems such as monthly tests and weekly tests were established, promotion and demotion boards were set up, and learning merit campaigns were launched, enabling the smooth progress of cultural learning in the entire regiment.

　　东北军区某团
    战士紧张学文化
  　领导上抓得紧，全国战士已无文盲。
    【本报讯】人民解放军东北军区警备某团、察哈尔军区某团，由于领导上的重视，战士们的努力，部队文化学习进展迅速。东北军区某团在最近四个月的军事练兵中，抓紧了文化学习。全团不识字的同志，最少的也识了百余字。大部分学了二、三百字，识四百字以上的占百分之五；六月到现在，全团丙组升乙组的二七八名，乙组升甲组的一四七名。察哈尔军区某团到现在不识字的只有百分之十左右了。三个月学习中，有二三○人学会了看报，一四五人学会写信、写墙报稿子。
    战士们的学习情绪极高，在练兵、义务劳动、课外活动的休息时间，都从口袋里掏出本子来学习；星期六也去找文化教员学几个生字。他们普遍的省下津贴买文具，据察哈尔军区某团统计，三个月中，全团添钢笔七九七支，铅笔四七九支，平均每人都有一个学习本子和一支笔。青年连赵胜岳并用自己的津贴订一份报纸供大家学习。班与班，个人与个人之间展开挑战竞赛，墙报上经常报导学习成绩和学习经验，造成了学习热潮。这种学习热潮的造成，和领导上的重视战士学习是密不可分的。东北军区某团曾召开全团文化教员会议，根据汇报，及时在行政干部中打通思想，纠正各级干部轻视文化教育的偏向，如把出公差、勤务等挤在文化课时间，为了清洁卫生等停开文化课，上文化课不检查人数，规定了点名制度，每堂课要检查人数；各组要按时汇报，定期检查。在学习上规定：授一课必须写生字，每授课八小时要复习一次，让战士们默写生字，练习作文、造句；每月考试一次，按月公布成绩。团的宣教股每周召开一次文化教育准备会，布置具体进度，研究教学方法，并每月到各连进行检查，以通报方式进行表扬批评。察哈尔军区某团领导上掌握学习情况，首先根据不同程度编班，各班聘请了教员，各营中心教员掌握全营文化学习，坚持学习制度并根据教学进度经常召集会议，研究学习方法与进度。建立了月测、周测等考试制度，设立升降牌，发动学习立功运动等，使全团文化学习得以顺利进展。
