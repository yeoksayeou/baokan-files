Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 28th: Since its establishment, the Third Field Army Mobile Bookstore of Xinhua Bookstore has been working in depth with the companies and has been warmly welcomed by the vast number of commanders and fighters. The East China Xinhua Bookstore began establishing mobile branches in the Third Field Army in May 1947, and successively established 36 branches and libraries in 259 companies. The staff has grown from five or six people to more than sixty. The bookstore established publishing work. Since May of this year, it has published 11 kinds of books, a total of 352,000 copies, among which the "People's Warrior Three-Character Classic" is the most popular, with 220,000 copies printed. In the early stage of work, due to frequent combat marches, the staff still had a purely business perspective, and the concept of serving the Liberation War and serving the troops was not clear, so the work progressed with difficulty. Later, under the instructions of the East China Xinhua Bookstore, the mobile branch should assist the troops in completing the political tasks of each period; and made the decision to not be afraid of losses and fully support the mobile branch; the staff also conducted a general review, initially established the idea of serving the troops, and the work gradually started. After the Jinan Campaign, a large number of mobile libraries were opened. When transportation conditions were difficult, the staff carried the books on their backs to follow the troops. After the Health Department branch arrived at the field hospital, it set up a ward library. Medical staff said: "The library played a role in spiritual recuperation." In the final stage of the Huaihai Campaign, the staff wrapped various readings favored by the soldiers and photos of the campaign process into small emergency packages and personally delivered them to the trenches, giving great encouragement to the commanders and fighters. After the battle, the bookstore staff went to the prisoner of war management office to hold photo exhibitions on our army's preferential treatment of prisoners and the people's support of our army, which also achieved good results. In addition, the mobile branch also handles the procurement of learning and office supplies for the troops. Because the mobile branch can truly serve the troops, it has gradually won the attention of leaders at all levels of the troops. They no longer regard the bookstore as a "burden," but do their best to assist the bookstore in solving difficult problems such as transportation.

However, there are still many shortcomings in the Third Field Army Mobile Bookstore, such as the small variety of warrior readings published, and the quantity is far from the actual needs; there are also phenomena such as lax discipline in the work, and it is impossible to master the scientific methods of management and business well. These must be gradually corrected. With the requirements of the development of the situation, the mobile bookstore plans to continue to expand cadres, enrich funds, strengthen the scientific management of business and publishing work, and plans to establish a warrior library in every company in the army.

　　第三野战军随军书店
    深入连队供应图书
    【新华社南京二十八日电】新华书店第三野战军随军分店自建店以来，深入连队工作，获得广大指战员的热烈欢迎。华东新华总店于一九四七年五月开始在第三野战军建立随军分店，先后成立了三十六个支店，二百五十九个连队的图书室；工作人员由五、六人发展到六十余人。该店建立了出版工作，今年五月以来共出版书籍十一种，三十五万二千册，其中以“人民战士三字经”最受欢迎，已印行二十二万册。工作初期，由于作战行军频繁，工作人员还存在着单纯营业观点，为解放战争服务，为部队服务的观念不明确，所以工作进展困难。后经华东新华书店指示：随军分店应当协助部队完成每个时期的政治任务；并作出不怕亏本、不怕损失、全力支援随军分店的决定；工作人员又普遍进行了检讨，初步树立了为部队服务的思想，工作逐渐展开。济南战役以后，大量开办了随军图书馆。当运输条件困难时，工作人员就自己背着书跟部队走。卫生部支店到野战医院后就举办病房图书室。医务工作人员说：“图书室起了精神疗养的作用”。淮海战役最后阶段，工作人员把战士最喜爱的各种读物和战役过程中的照片包成小急裹，亲自送到战壕里去，给指战员很大的鼓励。战斗结束后，书店工作人员就到俘虏管理处去，举办我军优待俘虏和人民支援我军的照片展览，也收到良好的效果。此外，随军分店并兼办采购部队学习和办公用品的工作。由于随军分店能为部队切实服务，逐渐赢得部队各级领导的重视。他们不再把书店看成“累赘”，而尽力协助书店解决运输工具等困难问题。
    但是，三野随军书店中仍然存在着不少缺点，如所出版的战士读物，种类既少，数量与实际需要也相差很远；工作中还有纪律不严等现象，并且不能很好地掌握管理业务的科学方法，这些都必须逐步纠正。随着形势发展的要求，今后随军书店打算继续扩充干部，充实资金，加强业务的科学管理和出版工作，并计划在全军每一连队建立一个战士图书室。
