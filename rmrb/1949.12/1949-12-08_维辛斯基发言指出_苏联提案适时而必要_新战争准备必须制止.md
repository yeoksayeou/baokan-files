　　Vyshinsky's Speech Points Out
  　Soviet Proposal is Timely and Necessary
  　New War Preparations Must Be Stopped
    British and other representatives of the US-British bloc, one after another, madly slandered the Soviet Union at the meeting. Therefore, at the meeting on December 1, when the discussion was finally concluded, Vyshinsky spoke again. He summarized the results of the discussion, refuted the slander against the Soviet Union and the Soviet proposal one by one, and reiterated the timeliness and necessity of the Soviet proposal. Vyshinsky cited numerous documents to refute British representative McNeil's slander that the Soviet Union refused to cooperate on the issue of reducing armaments and armed forces. He pointed out that it was precisely the US-British bloc that rejected the Soviet Union's insistence that the collection of intelligence on national armaments must include intelligence on atomic weapons, thus making disarmament ineffective. Vyshinsky also refuted the arrogant remarks of the representatives of Ecuador, Uruguay, Lebanon and other countries "demanding that the Soviet Union change its foreign policy." Vyshinsky said: Are you referring to the policy that has always been purified and inspired by the struggle for peace? The representative of Ecuador is not satisfied with the Soviet proposal to call a spade a spade, but we call war mongers and organizers of new wars by their true names. American and British generals and naval officers, ministers, and high officials, threaten day and night to launch new wars, destroy the residents of our cities and villages, and destroy our houses, factories, schools, hospitals, our economy and our culture. We expose these perfidious and barbaric plans and ask for only one thing, that these plans should be condemned, and that this hatred of peace should be stopped, because this activity is indeed hostile to peace and the interests of all mankind. But the gentlemen from Ecuador and Uruguay are not happy about this, and they oppose this demand. If this attitude is not encouraging aggressors, not encouraging new war provocateurs, what else could it be? Vyshinsky also exposed the so-called atmosphere of fear and mistrust in the world, therefore the Soviet proposal is "untimely." Vyshinsky pointed out that the Soviet proposal is valuable and important precisely because the world is indeed living in an atmosphere of fear.
    Vyshinsky finally pointed out: New war preparations must be stopped. All intolerable activities related to new war preparations that are being carried out systematically in some countries must be stopped. Unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international control to ensure the implementation of this ban must be practical. The voices of hundreds of millions of people and the voices of peace-loving countries must be heard. This is the lofty task that the Five-Power Pact for Strengthening Peace proposed by the Soviet government should and must fulfill.
    Vyshinsky's speech concluded the Soviet Union's discussion on the proposal to condemn new war preparations and the Five-Power Pact for Strengthening Peace.
    Subsequently, the US-British proposal, which was heavily promoted and titled "Essentials of Peace," was passed by the usual majority of the US and Britain. This proposal is not only composed of some general declarations haphazardly extracted from the UN Charter, but also mixed with some harmful and dangerous suggestions, such as suggestions aimed at restricting the national sovereignty of various countries.
    The Soviet proposal was routinely rejected by the majority of the US-British bloc. However, when each item was put to a vote, as many as thirteen countries voted in favor of the Soviet proposal, including the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian and Byelorussian Republics, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Afghanistan, Guatemala, Israel, the Philippines, and Yemen. As many as twenty-three countries, including Burma, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Mexico, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Thailand, abstained from expressing opposition to the Soviet Union's just proposal.

### 维辛斯基发言指出　苏联提案适时而必要　新战争准备必须制止

　　维辛斯基发言指出
  　苏联提案适时而必要
  　新战争准备必须制止
    英国以及美英集团其他国家的代表们，也先后在会上对苏联进行疯狂的诬蔑。因此，在十二月一日的会议上，当最后结束讨论时，维辛斯基再度发言。他总结了讨论的结果，对诽谤苏联与苏联提案的谰言一一予以痛斥；并再度阐明了苏联提案的适时与必要。维辛斯基援引许多文件驳斥了英国代表麦克奈尔诬蔑苏联在裁减军备与武装部队问题上拒绝合作的说法，他指出，恰恰是美英集团拒绝了苏联所坚持的在搜集各国军备的情报时必须包括原子武器情报在内的建议，因而使裁军不能有效地实现。维辛斯基也驳斥了厄瓜多尔、乌拉圭、黎巴嫩等国代表“要求苏联改变外交政策”的狂妄言论。维辛斯基说：你们是指的那一直被衷心争和平的斗争所净化与鼓舞的政策吗？厄瓜多尔的代表并不满意于把一个铲子叫做一个铲子的苏联提案，我们却名符其实地把战争贩子和新战争的组织者叫做战争贩子和新战争的组织者。美国和英国的将军们和海军将官们、部长们和大臣们，它们日日夜夜地威胁着要发动新战争，毁灭我们城市与乡村的居民，破坏我们的房屋、工厂、学校、医院，我们的经济和我们的文化。我们揭露这些无信义的和野蛮的计划，而只要求一件事情，就是这些计划应受到谴责，这种仇视和平的活动应予制止，因为这种活动确实是仇视和平与全人类利益的。但是，厄瓜多尔与乌拉圭的绅士们不高兴这些，他们反对这种要求。如果说这种态度不是鼓励侵略者，不是鼓励新战争挑拨者，那还能是什么呢？维辛斯基也揭露了所谓世界上存在着惊惧怀不信任的气氛，因此苏联的建议是“不合时宜的说法”。维辛斯基指出，苏联建议之所以有价值而且重要，正是因为世界确定是生活在惊惧的气氛中。
    维辛斯基最后指出：新战争准备必须制止。一切与新战争准备有关的正在若干国家里有系统地进行的不可容忍的勾当必须停止。无条件禁止原子武器以及为保证执行这个禁令而建立严格的国际管制必须实际。亿万人民的呼声，要求和平的国家的呼声必须听取。这是苏联政府所提出的五国加强和平公约所应该而且必须履行的崇高任务。
    维辛斯基的发言结束了苏联关于谴责新战争准备以及五强缔结加强和平公约提案的讨论。
    其后，大家渲染而以“和平要义”为题的美英提案即被英美的照例多数所通过。这一提案不仅是由联合国宪章胡乱摘引拼揍起来的若干一般性宣言所构成，而且其中还夹杂着一些有害和危险的建议，诸如旨在限制各国的国家主权的建议等等。
    苏联提案则照例地被美英集团的多数所否决。但在逐项提付表决时，投票赞成苏联提案的国家多至十三国，包括苏联、乌克兰及白俄罗斯共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、阿富汗、危地马拉、以色列、菲律宾、也门等。不愿表示反对苏联公正提案而弃权的国家多至二十三国，包括缅甸、多米尼加、埃及、墨西哥、伊朗、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、泰国等。
