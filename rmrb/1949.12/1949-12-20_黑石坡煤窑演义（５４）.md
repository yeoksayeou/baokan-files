　　Black Stone Slope Coal Mine Chronicles (54)
　　Kang Tuo
　　The water was bailed out day after day, and the people's enthusiasm was incredibly high. They were saying one shift of one thousand five, but everyone was trying their best to exceed that number, and they wouldn't even take a break for the first New Year after liberation, determined to keep bailing! At this time, the whole village was also checking components and discussing who should make up how much land, so the enthusiasm from the mine spread over, causing the whole village to clamor for more effort and a surge forward, deciding to rest only on the first day of the New Year. After the New Year, Lao Bai came again to inspect. He also went down the mine to bail water for a shift, getting out more than one thousand seven hundred buckets; Lao Yin couldn't finish a full shift, but he still went down to try it out twice; Shuan Cheng also scrambled to bail, barely making the quota the first time, but later he put in extra effort, doing more each time; Yu Bao, needless to say, got at least one thousand six; even Xi Lu's son and Qian Danao, who initially couldn't bail one thousand, slowly became capable, with Qian Danao always stiffening his neck and tilting his head, his whole body sweating profusely, his arms and legs trembling but not stopping. Anyone who saw him wanted to laugh. And then there was Tian Lu, who, once he got the hang of it, even managed to get more than one thousand nine hundred buckets in one shift! After bailing for ten days, not only were three water wheels installed, but the water was bailed down to the level of the fourth wheel! At this point, the first wheel was the hardest to bail, and if water couldn't be bailed out from here, the water below couldn't be bailed up either. So, several people fought to bail at the first wheel. Niu Bao had great strength, always getting one thousand six or seven per shift. When he went to work, he insisted on bailing at the first wheel, sometimes even arguing with others about it. And whenever those bailing at the first wheel took a break to smoke, idlers who weren't working would rush up to bail for a while. Looking at the West Mine, Tai Cheng also seemed to be competing with Da San, his work being much stronger than before, always producing eleven or twelve tons of coal every day!
　　More and more villagers were asking to buy shares in the mine, and some were even clamoring to turn the mine into a cooperative with shares for everyone in the whole village. People from other villages also came to meddle, wanting to order a batch of coal first. Whenever Xi Lu had nothing to do at the counter, he would go down the mine to take a look. Every day after work, he would carry a load of coal back. Bai Quan's family even organized seven women to carry coal from the West Mine every day, sending it to the iron furnace in the neighboring village. Even Niu Bao's sister-in-law often came, even specially finding a set of tattered clothes to wear, carrying fifty or sixty catties of coal, staggering and shouting as she walked away. The mine site saw countless people coming and going every day, countless words being spoken, and countless quarrels and laughs! It was truly a good scene of liberation!

　　Fifty-one　Problem

　　On the seventh day of the first month, the mine ran into a bit of trouble.

　　The number of buckets of water bailed that day was still enough, but Da San and his brothers all noticed that the water was going down less than usual. The counting was very strict, so there couldn't be any mistakes. Niu Bao was bailing at the first wheel, and it didn't seem like there were any mistakes! So, what was the reason?

　　The next day, during the early shift, Da San and his two brothers secretly inspected back and forth at each wheel, but didn't see anything! Until this shift was almost over, Xiao Yanggui came down to wait for his shift. Liu Goujia wanted to relieve himself, so he asked him to cover for a moment. He said, "Are you still shy? Just this pee?" Liu Goujia said, "You're so small, you're not afraid of seeing my urine bubble, but is it even smaller?" While they were joking, Niu Bao was also laughing while bailing water. Unexpectedly, Da San was at the second wheel, staring intently at Niu Bao. Whoa! It turned out this guy was playing tricks! He was bailing fast and didn't stop, and every bucket of water was quite full, but when he lifted the bucket, he shook it back and forth twice, and a lot of water immediately spilled out. When it was poured into the wooden trough, the water looked like a full bucket, but in reality, only half was left! Da San was immediately furious and rushed down to find his second brother. Coincidentally, Liu Goujia returned, and seeing Da San from afar, he quickly called him. He stopped, and after Liu Goujia quietly whispered a few words to him with a smile, he only heard him curse "Bah!" and went down. Over here, Xiao Yanggui shouted, "I didn't see you take so long for a pee! You came in and started yelling at Uncle Da San like a madman, could it be that he'll like you, you old thing?" Liu Goujia slapped him and grabbed someone to count in his place, pulling Xiao Yanggui to a secluded spot outside the mine and quietly telling him: it turned out that she had long wanted to figure out if Da San and Bai Quan's family could really be brought together, but then, when dividing the spoils, Da San discovered that his old white silk pants had been preserved in Ju Bao's clothes chest for many years, and had been displayed as public property. So, he took them back. Liu Goujia, seeing Da San take back the silk pants, was even more moved, and had spoken to Bai Quan's family several times, but Bai Quan's family never gave a definite answer. She herself was getting old and not as nimble or quick-tongued as she used to be, so she put the matter aside. Unexpectedly, when she went out to relieve herself, she ran into Bai Quan's group carrying coal, resting and joking under the opera stage. Somehow, they were also teasing Bai Quan's family, telling her to ask Da San to mediate! Saying Da San was skilled! Advanced! Liu Goujia went to ask about the reason and root of the matter, and Bai Quan's family surprisingly said: "We'll talk about it later! Let's see what this mine turns into, and see if his temper changes!" How could Liu Goujia not be anxious to tell Da San about this! Even Xiao Yanggui was happy to hear it, wishing he could quickly find Da San to arrange it!

　　Speaking of Da San, he was full of anger, looking for his second brother, but unexpectedly, after hearing Liu Goujia say that situation: "Let's see what this mine… Let's see if his temper…" He immediately shuddered. It turned out that he had also thought about that matter since liberation… At that moment, his anger was half doused! Coincidentally, he couldn't find his second brother either, and his enthusiasm for taking action was much lessened.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（５４）
    康濯
    水就这么一天两天地打着，人们的劲头是高得不能说。你说一班一千五，可谁也是拼着要多出这个数目，而且解放后的头一个年也不过，非打下去不成！这时全村又正检查成份，讨论谁该补多少地，于是窑上的劲头传过去，闹得浑村都嚷着要加油突击，决定只歇年初一一天。过了年，老白又来检查，他也下窑打了一班水，打出一千七百多壳篓；老尹打不完一班，但也下去试吧了两回；拴成也抢着打，头一回才凑合打够数，后来却别着劲，一回比一回多；玉宝不用说，起码一千六；就连喜禄的小子和乾大脑，开头还打不够一千，慢慢却也能够数，乾大脑每回还总是硬着脖子歪着脑袋，浑身别得汗如流水，胳膊腿发抖也不歇，谁看了他都想发笑；再有天禄，他打顺了手，有一班还怪稀罕地打出了一千九百多壳篓！这么打了十天，不光安上了三道旋，并且水打到了四道旋的地势了！这工夫，头道旋最难打，这里要打不出水，那下边的水也就会打不上来；于是又有几个人抢打头道旋，牛宝力气大，每班总是一千六七，他一上班就是非头道旋不打，有时他还会为这跟别人争吵；而每逢打头道旋的歇下来抽袋把烟，旁边没上班的闲人，总要抢上去打一阵，再看西窑那面，泰成也象要跟大三比试一般，营生比往日强得多，每天不差什么，总要出到十一二吨炭！
    村里要求入股的窑黑多起来了，并且还有嚷着：要把窑闹成浑村大伙都有股份的，外村也有人来捣拉，想先定一批炭；喜禄逢当柜上没事，也总要下窑看看，每天下工时候，他还总要担一担炭回去，白泉家还组织了七个妇女，每天上西窑担炭，往邻村铁炉上送；就连牛宝他嫂也常来，她还特外寻了身破衣裳穿着，担个五几十斤炭，支支扭扭地吆喝着走开去。窑场上，每天不知要来往多少人，要咯嚷多少话语，还要打闹要笑多少回哩！真个是翻身解放的好风光！
    五十一　问题
    正月初七，窑上却出了点毛病。
    这天打水的壳篓数倒还够，但大三弟兄却都发现水下去得比往日少、打点的很严，不会有差错的，牛宝打头道旋，也不象有错！这可是为什么？
    第二天早班，大三弟兄俩在各道旋来回暗里察访，也没见什么！直到这一班快完，小洋鬼下来等上班，柳沟家要解手，让他替两下，他说：“你还害臊么？就这尿吧！”柳沟家道：“你这么小的个子，不怕见我尿泡的，可个子更小了？”二人耍笑当中，牛宝也边打水边笑着；不想大三正在二道旋上，紧瞅着牛宝，嚯！原来是这家伙耍花头！看他也打得快也不歇，每一壳篓水也挺满，但他把壳篓往上提溜的时候，却前后晃两晃，水立时便倒出了很多，往木槽里晃着一倒，水看起来还象是一满壳篓，其实却只剩下一半了！大三顿时火起，急忙下去寻他老二去；恰好柳沟家回来，远远见了大三，就连忙叫他，他停了停，也不知柳沟家悄悄跟他笑说了几句什么，只见他骂了声“呸！”下去了。这边小洋鬼却嚷道：“没见你一泡尿那么大工夫的！一进来又疯着叫大三叔，莫非他还会喜爱你这老货？”柳沟家打了他一巴掌，就随便抓了个人打点，把小洋鬼拉到窑外的僻静地势，悄悄告给他：原来她早就想算过，能不能真给大三和白泉家说合成一件好事的，后来分果实，大三发现他过去那条白绸裤却在聚宝衣箱里保存了多年，当时并成了群众的浮财摆设出来，于是他又领回去了；柳沟家那会见了大三领绸裤，就更动了心，并跟白泉家说了几回，白泉家却总没个准话，她自己也老得没往日那么腿勤嘴快，这就把事情撂了。不想她刚才出去解手，正碰见白泉家那伙担炭的在戏楼底歇着耍笑，不知怎么她们也逗着叫白泉家寻大三说合咧！说大三把式强咧！进步咧！柳沟家去问了问缘由根底，白泉家却怪稀罕地说：“往后再说吧！看他这窑闹成个啥，看他那脾性改不改！”这情由，柳沟家可怎么能不急着告给大三啊！连小洋鬼听了也高兴得不行，他也恨不得赶紧寻大三去说合说合哩！
    再说大三，他正满肚子火气要寻他老二，不想碰见柳沟家一说那情由：“看他那窑……看他那脾性……”他立时浑身一抖；原来他自从解放以后，也是想过那事的哩……当时他的火气不觉给泼凉了一半！恰好寻他老二也寻不见，他想动动态度的劲头，也就小多了。
