　　Several Opinions on Carrying Out This Year's Winter Production
    Shanxi Provincial Government Agriculture Department
    In order to vigorously restore and develop agricultural production, and strive to restore and surpass the pre-war level within one to two years, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of organization, develop mutual aid and cooperation, and launch a winter production campaign on the basis of the Three Autumns Movement to lay a good foundation for next year's major production. For this purpose, the following suggestions are put forward:

    I. Use various methods to accumulate and ferment fertilizer in large quantities. Next year, it is required that 43 dan of fertilizer be applied per mu in the old liberated areas to reach the pre-war level, and 80% of the pre-war level in the new liberated areas. Mobilize the masses to diligently pad enclosures and collect manure. Organize smoking forests and digging manure pits according to conditions and habits. Combine epidemic prevention and hygiene, clear collapsed wall ash and soil, and collect bones to burn for fertilizer. Areas lacking coal should pay attention to repairing roads for transporting coal and burning coal to save grass for composting manure. Appropriately restore and develop oil mills and flour mills to make sesame cakes and accumulate pig manure. To do a good job in accumulating fertilizer, each village can hold forums for experienced farmers to exchange fertilizer accumulation experiences. Village cadres should help the masses formulate fertilizer accumulation plans door-to-door. After comparing model manure piles, areas that are mainly wheat fields should aim to accumulate enough fertilizer this winter and exceed it, while areas that are mainly autumn fields should aim to reach more than 75% of the amount of fertilizer to be applied next spring.

    II. Restore and develop the iron and wood farm implement manufacturing industry, and repair and manufacture farm implements in large quantities. First of all, conduct a specific investigation of the shortage of farm implements, and determine a certain amount of agricultural implement loans in the winter production loans to help solve the difficulties of those engaged in the restoration and development of the iron and wood farm implement manufacturing industry. Set up furnaces and factories in various market towns and villages according to the required quantity for repair and manufacturing. In order to solve the capital difficulties caused by inventory backlog, the masses can be organized to order goods according to standards and manufacture them, and strive to obtain a certain supplement or enough major farm implements such as harrows, plows, rakes, hoes, and shovels.

    III. Increase the purchase and breeding of livestock, and actively prevent and control livestock plagues. In addition to strengthening the existing feeding management of draft animals, it is necessary to systematically mobilize and organize livestock dealers to purchase from the Suiyuan-Mongolia livestock producing areas. Reward the breeding of male and female breeding livestock and raising pigs and sheep to breed livestock groups. In order to reduce livestock deaths, the Provincial Government Livestock Epidemic Prevention Institute will inject 100,000 head of draft animals and hold training for veterinarians. Each special county should focus on supporting the restoration and development of veterinary stations, establish an epidemic reporting network in epidemic areas, and initially establish livestock administration.

    IV. Organize coal mining and firewood gathering to supply fuel for next spring. Organize the masses to transport and store fuel by themselves, or sell it to towns. Localities can restore or develop coal markets and coal yards as needed to facilitate coal supply and sales. Mountainous areas accustomed to burning firewood should organize the masses to gather and store firewood so that they can devote themselves to spring plowing next spring.

    V. Advocate helping to restore handicrafts and sideline production that have sales channels. Handicrafts and sideline industries account for 20% to 25% of people's income. Localities should develop small-scale mutual aid and cooperative production based on the people's production and living needs and favorable export conditions, and systematically restore and develop sulfur, gypsum, alkali production, weaving mats, iron industry, and agricultural and sideline product processing industries (such as oil extraction, flour milling, and medicine making). In addition, roads should be repaired in a timely manner, bridges should be built, and transportation should be organized to strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, so as to promote production and increase farmers' income. Areas with poor harvests this year should pay more attention to this.

    VI. Develop water conservancy and irrigation. Mobilize the masses to restore and develop canals, waterwheels, wells, and other water conservancy machinery projects according to specific conditions, and carry out engineering surveys and measurements, and purchase engineering materials to prepare for next spring's work. Areas with existing water conservancy should combine winter irrigation and flood control, summarize the annual water conservancy work, check unreasonable feudal water regulations and organizations, and transform them according to actual conditions. In addition, the promotion of waterwheels and the repair of water conservancy machinery should also be started as soon as possible.

    VII. Rectify and establish farms, and prepare for the promotion of industrial crops. It is required that Taiyuan, Yuncheng, Changzhi, and Xingxian farms be agricultural experiment and breeding farms, Linfen, Fenyang, and Xinxian be agricultural breeding and promotion farms, and each county establish or rectify agricultural promotion farms. Farms at all levels should prepare according to this policy. In addition, cotton, tobacco, and hemp skins are required to expand by 30% to 50% on the existing planting area. Localities should actively organize the masses to purchase local or foreign high-quality varieties to prepare for promotion next year to ensure the minimum requirements for the supply of industrial raw materials.

    VIII. Clearing weeds from field edges and burning stubble is an important task for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. Localities should universally mobilize the masses to carry out this work, and effectively organize inspections to achieve the purpose of clean edges, clean fields, and increased production.

    In order to implement the above tasks, the following two points must be paid attention to in leadership: First, it is necessary to stimulate the development of winter production through the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and prepare for next year's major production campaign. From special counties to districts and villages, it is necessary to strengthen the planning of production, grasp the main tasks in the organization and implementation, and solve key problems, otherwise, it will inevitably fall into blindness, causing the plan to fail, and even causing losses to the masses. Second, vigorously implement the policy of organization, and universally develop various agricultural and sideline small-scale mutual aid and cooperative organizations in winter production, and give full play to the productive role of human, material, and financial resources. Clearly recognize that making one point of achievement this year will play a ten-point role next year. Through winter production mutual aid, lay the organizational foundation for next year's major production.

　　对开展今年冬季生产的几点意见
    山西省政府农业处
    为大力恢复与发展农业生产，争取于一二年内恢复并超过战前，必须在三秋运动的基础上，继续贯彻组织起来的方针，发展互助合作，开展冬季生产运动，为明年大生产打好基础。为此特提出如下几点意见：
    一、利用各种办法大量积肥沤粪。明年要求老区每亩施肥四十三担，达到战前水平，新区每亩施肥要求达到战前百分之八十。动员群众勤垫圈、多拾粪，根据条件和习惯组织薰林洞、挖茅坑，结合防疫卫生，清除塌墙灰土，拾骨烧肥。缺煤地区注意修通拉煤道路，烧用煤炭，节草沤粪。并适当的恢复和发展油坊、粉坊，制麻饼积猪肥。为把积肥工作作好，各村可召开老农座谈会，交流积肥经验。村干部应挨门逐户帮助群众订立积肥计划，经过比粪堆表模范，要求麦田为主地区，今冬积肥要求达到够用并超过之，秋田为主地区要达到明春施肥量百分之七十五以上。
    二、恢复和发展铁木农具制造业，大量修理制造农具。首先要具体调查农具缺乏情况，在冬季生产贷款中，确定一定的农具贷款，以帮助解决恢复和发展铁木农具制造业者的困难。各集市城镇及乡村按需要数量安炉设厂，进行修理制造。为解决其因存货积压的资本困难，可组织群众按标准实行订货，进行制造，争取＠、耧、耙、镢、锹等主要农具上，得到一定的补充或够用。
    三、增购繁殖家畜，并积极防治畜瘟。除加强现有耕畜饲养管理外，要有计划的动员组织扶植畜贩从绥蒙畜产区进行购买。并奖励饲养公母种畜及养猪养羊以繁殖畜群。为减少家畜死亡，由省府家畜防疫所注射耕畜十万头和举办训练兽医；各专县应有重点的扶植恢复与发展兽医站，在疫区建立疫情报告网，初步建立畜政。
    四、组织拉煤打些供应明春燃料。组织群众进行自运积存燃料，或推销城镇。各地按需要可恢复或发展炭集炭园，以便煤业供销。惯于烧柴的山岳地区，要组织群众打柴积柴，以便明春全力进行春耕。
    五、提倡帮助恢复有销路的手工业及副业生产。手工业及副业占人民收入的百分之二十到二十五，各地应根据人民生产生活需要和有利外销等条件，发展小型互助合作的生产，有计划的恢复发展硫磺、石膏、制碱、编席、铁业和农副产品加工制造业（如榨油、磨粉、制药等）。此外应及时修路、架桥、组织运输加强城乡物资交流，以推进生产并增加农民收入。今年歉收地区更应重视。
    六、发展水利灌溉事业。根据具体条件动员群众恢复和发展水渠、水车、水井及其他水利机械事业，并进行工程勘察测量，购置工料，为明春与工作准备。已有水利地区应结合冬浇和防洪，总结全年水利工作，检查不合理的封建水规和组织机构，依据实际情形予以改造。此外，推广水车及修理水利机械工作亦应即早着手。
    七、整顿建立农场，并进行推广工业作物之准备工作。要求太原、运城、长治、兴县等农场为农业试验繁殖场，临汾、汾阳、忻县为农业繁殖推广场，各县设立或整顿农业推广场，各级农场依此方针进行准备工作。此外棉花、烟叶、麻皮要求在现有种植面积上扩大百分之三十至五十，各地应积极组织群众采购当地或外区优良品种，为明年作推广准备，以保证供应工业原料最低限度之要求。
    八、清除地＠边堰杂草、刨烧谷茌实为防除病虫害的重要工作，各地应普遍的发动群众进行，并确实组织检查，以达光边净堰增加生产的目的。
    为了贯彻上述任务，在领导上必须注意下列两点：一、必须通过城乡物资交流刺激发展冬季生产，并为明年大生产运动作准备。由专县到区村均需加强生产计划性，在组织实施中掌握主要工作，解决关键问题，否则势必陷于盲目，使计划落空，甚至造成群众损失。二、大力贯彻组织起来的方针，普遍发展冬季生产中各种农副业小型互助合作组织，充分发挥人力物力财力的生产作用。明确认识今年作好一分成绩，明年发挥十分作用。经过冬季生产互助，为明年大生产奠定组织基础。
