　　Attempting to Support the Last-Ditch Struggle of Remnant Bandits
    US Transports Large Quantities of Military Supplies to Taiwan
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 20th: The latest evidence of the US government's continued active aggression against China and interference in China's internal affairs is seen in its military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan. The US government has recently transported a large quantity of military supplies to Taiwan to support the Kuomintang bandit gang in carrying out a counter-revolutionary struggle in Taiwan, preventing the liberation of Taiwan, and attempting to strengthen its control over Taiwan through this supply of military supplies, making Taiwan one of the forward military bases of the US in the Pacific.
    With the collapse of the Kuomintang bandit gang on the Chinese mainland, American imperialism is focusing its attention on Taiwan, doing its utmost to help the Kuomintang bandit gang manage this last nest of anti-people activity. According to an Associated Press report from Washington on the 8th, Taiwan has become a matter of "urgent concern to the State Department and the Department of Defense" of the United States. According to a US Information Service dispatch from Washington on the 14th: "US Secretary of State Acheson stated at a press conference today that the status of Taiwan is a very important issue. This issue is frequently brought up for discussion in the National Security Council. The National Security Council is composed of many of President Truman's top advisors."
    The US government is so interested in this territory of China that it does not hesitate to continue investing in the already defeated Kuomintang bandit gang. According to a Central News Agency (Kuomintang) dispatch from Manila on the 12th, quoting a senior official of the Philippine government: "According to confidential reports obtained by the Philippine government, large quantities of US aid military supplies are being shipped from the United States to Taiwan. The highest Philippine authorities have learned that Acheson has decided to take the most active action possible to support the Kuomintang government's last stronghold, Taiwan, and resist the threat of communist invasion." Another United Press dispatch from Washington on the 13th quoted US official sources as saying that the US government is considering the use of the $75 million military aid appropriation passed by Congress on the Taiwan issue. A New York Times editorial on the 14th strongly advocated that this "aid to China funds should be immediately used to consolidate Taiwan." The newspaper also proposed sending a US military delegation to strengthen control over Taiwan under the guise of supervising the effective use of weapons and military supplies.
    Other imperialist elements in the United States are simultaneously continuing to advocate the crazy plan of occupying Taiwan. The American militarists, represented by MacArthur, regard Taiwan as an indispensable and important stronghold in the US Pacific military base network. They travel back and forth between Washington, Tokyo, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, frequently contacting representatives of the Kuomintang bandit gang and instigating the so-called "Taiwan Independence League" organized by American spies to clamor for Taiwan's "independence." The following remarks by three Republican senators illustrate the dreams of these aggressors. Ferguson said: "The United States should send troops to Taiwan if necessary to prevent the CCP from invading." (Associated Press) Smith said: "He would very much like to see the United States acquire Taiwan for its own security. Just declare that the island is part of the occupied territory currently under MacArthur's administration." (Agence France-Presse) Crawford said: "The United States should be prepared to help Britain defend Hong Kong and defend Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, and the Philippines at all costs. ... Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, and the Philippines are inseparable."
    The Kuomintang bandit gang has repeatedly cheered the US conspiracy to invade Taiwan. Taipei newspapers published a statement from a so-called authoritative person saying: "If the United States is willing to assist Taiwan, the Chinese authorities will certainly cooperate, and the amount of US assistance will not be very large." An Associated Press dispatch from Washington stated that Chiang Kai-shek requested the United States to protect Taiwan in some form. Li Zongren, who went to the United States to seek assistance, is also engaged in the business of selling Taiwan. An Associated Press dispatch from Hong Kong on the 10th stated that the acting president, who is now in a New York hospital, will accept any US conditions in exchange for a temporary agreement.

　　妄图支援残匪最后挣扎
    美大批军火运台湾
    【新华社北京二十日电】美国政府继续积极侵略中国和干涉中国内政的最新的证据，见于该政府对于台湾蒋匪的军事援助。美国政府最近以大批军火运往台湾，支持国民党匪帮在台湾进行反革命挣扎，阻止台湾的解放，并企图通过这种这火的接济，加强对台湾的控制，使台湾成为美国的太平洋前哨军事基地之一。
    随着国民党匪帮在中国大陆的覆灭，美帝国主义即将视线集中于台湾，极力帮助国民党匪帮经营这一反人民的最后巢穴。据美联社华盛顿八日消息，台湾已成为美国“国务院与国防部迫切关心的问题”。又据美国新闻处华盛顿十四日电：“美国务卿艾奇逊今日在记者招待会中声称：台湾之地位，乃一极为重要的问题。此一问题时常在国家安全委员会中提出讨论。按国家安全委员会乃杜鲁门总统最高顾问多人所组成。”
    美国政府对于中国这一领土如此感到兴趣，竟不惜对于已经失败的国民党匪帮继续进行投资。据国民党中央社马尼拉十二日电引菲律宾政府某高级官员的话透露：“根据菲政府所获机密报告，大批美国援华军用物资正在从美国运往台湾途中。菲最高级当局获悉，艾奇逊已决定采取可能范围内最积极的行动，支持国民党政府的最后堡垒台湾，而抵抗共产党侵入的威胁。”另据合众社华盛顿十三日电引美国官方人士的谈话，说明美政府正在考虑国会所通过的七千五百万军事援助拨款的使用于台湾问题。纽约时报十四日社论极力主张：这笔“援华费用应立即用以巩固台湾”。该报并提出了派遣美国军事代表团，以监督武器军火的有效使用为名，来加强对于台湾的掌管。
    美国的其他帝国主义分子们同时在继续鼓吹着占领台湾的狂妄计划。以麦克阿瑟为代表的美国黩武主义分子，把台湾看作美国在太平洋军事基地网中一个不可缺少的重要据点。他们来往华盛顿、东京、台湾、香港之间，频频与国民党匪帮的代表接触，并策动美国奸细所组织的所谓“台湾独立同盟”叫嚣台湾“独立”。下面三个共和党参议员的谈话，说明这些侵略分子的梦想。福开森说：“美国在必要时，应该派军队至台湾，以防止中共侵入。”（合众社）史密斯说：“他深愿看到美国为其本身安全计取得台湾。只要声明这个岛是目前麦克阿瑟管理下的占领区之一部分就行了。”（法新社）克劳福说：“美国应准备帮助英国保卫香港，并不惜任何牺牲保卫日本、琉球、台湾、菲律宾。…日本、琉球、台湾、菲律宾都是不可分的。”
    国民党匪帮对于美国侵略台湾阴谋一再表示欢呼。台北报纸刊载一个所谓权威人士的谈话说：“如美国愿意援助台湾，中国当局必表合作，而美国援助所费为数并不甚大。”又美联社华盛顿消息说：蒋介石要求美国在某种形式下保护台湾。赴美国求援的李匪宗仁也在进行拍卖台湾的勾当。美联社香港十日电称：现在纽约一医院中的代总统，为换取一临时协定，将接受美国任何条件。
