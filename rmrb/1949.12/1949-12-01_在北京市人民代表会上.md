　　At the Beijing Municipal People's Congress
    Wang Ruoxian, Representative of the Women's No. 1 Middle School
    The Voice of Workers and Peasants
    Under the five-star flag, our student delegation marched into the meeting hall in formation.
    As warm applause filled the hall, Mayor Nie was about to report on his work. I listened attentively, but gradually my attention drifted. I realized I had always trusted our new government, but why exactly did I trust it? I had never explicitly thought about it. Now the government was reporting to us, wanting us to understand it, and even asking us to review its work. Workers and peasants, once trampled underfoot, were now speaking powerfully on the stage: "We not only thank the government, but we also unanimously support Mayor Nie's report..." This was the voice from their hearts.
    The Great Emancipation of Women
    "In the old society, women were abused both physically and mentally. Such things should not exist in our new society..." On the second day of the meeting, someone spoke on stage about the draft resolution to close brothels. Everyone in the audience focused their eyes on the speaker's mouth and the paper in their hand.
    As soon as the resolution was finished, the applause in the hall was so loud it almost broke the roof.
    When it came to voting, we all raised our hands high, especially the women, who really wanted to raise their hands to the ceiling.
    I believe we all shared the same thought: The evils left over from the old society must be eliminated by us. Women have truly been liberated.
    Everyone is Progressing
    After the draft resolution on tax revenue was proposed, a peasant representative said: "The government has done so much for us, and this tax, as Deputy Mayor Zhang said, is taken from the people and used for the people. Therefore, we will definitely guarantee the completion of the tax payment task."
    A worker representative said: "Most of the money from this tax revenue is put into construction projects. We are very honored, and we must work hard in production to live up to the government's expectations."
    A business representative also said: "As Deputy Mayor Zhang said, most of our industry and commerce have now recovered. We should no longer rely on the countryside. Building our own city requires us to pay for it ourselves. I am a taxpayer, but I strongly support the tax revenue resolution."
    Think about it, would they have said such things in the past? But now they all said it consciously and willingly, which proves that they are all progressing. Retreat is a dead end; only advance! Advance! And advance again!
    Great Unity of the People of Beijing
    On the afternoon of the day the meeting ended, it was announced that Mayor Nie had been elected. We were all happily smiling, and carried this joy to the restaurant until night.
    When it was time to eat, the worker representatives first proposed a toast to the student representatives. We were so happy that some of us stood on benches. Everyone raised a glass and shouted, "Long live the working class!"
    Comrade Peng Zhen, Deputy Mayor Zhang, peasant representatives... we toasted them, they toasted us, and then we all toasted the women representatives together. Glasses waved in the air, and it was impossible to tell who was laughing and who was speaking. In short, it was a scene of cheers, friendship, like an indestructible force.
    At this moment, I wanted to shout: "Long live the great unity of the people of Beijing!"
    Moving Towards Victory
    Through this meeting, I further understood the government. It is indeed doing things for us, and I have received a lot of ideological education. I know that doing things must be planned like this meeting, and at no time should we be detached from the masses, and we must always listen to the opinions of the masses and trust the masses.

　　在北京市人民代表会上
    女一中代表  王若仙
    工农的声音
    在五星国旗下，我们学生代表团，整队走进了会场。
    当会场内热烈的掌声响起的时候，是聂市长要报告他的工作了，我聚精会神的听着，可是慢慢的我的注意力跑了。因为我在想：我从来只是相信我们新的政府，可是我究竟为什么信任它？我没有明确的想过。现在政府向我们作报告，要我们去了解它，并且叫我们，来审查他的工作，从前被人踏在脚下的工人、农民们都有力的在台上讲着：“我们对政府除感谢而外，并且我们一致拥护聂市长的报告……”这是他们心里发出的声音。
    妇女大解放
    “这是旧社会里，肉体上和精神上蹂躏妇女的事，我们新社会里是不应该有这种事存在的……”在会议的第二天，有人在台上讲关于封闭妓院的决议草案，台下每个人的眼睛都集中在报告人的嘴和他手里的一张纸上。
    在决议刚刚讲完的时候，会场上掌声响的要震破了房顶。
    在表决的时候，我们都高高的举起了自己的手，尤其是妇女，真的想要把手举到房顶上去。
    相信我们都有着同一的想法：旧社会留下来的罪恶，要被我们消灭的。妇女是真的得到解放了。
    人人都在进步
    当税收问题的决议草案提出后，农民代表说：“政府给我们办了那么多事，并且这税是象张副市长说的一样，取之于民，用之于民的，所以我们一定保证完成纳税的任务。”
    工人代表说：“这次税收的钱大部都放在建设事业，我们非常光荣，我们一定要努力生产，不辜负政府的期望”。
    商界代表也说：“象张副市长说的一样，我们现在的工商业大部都已经恢复了，我们不应再依赖乡村。建设我们自己的城市是要我们自己出钱了，我是纳税的人，可是对于税收决议我是非常拥护的。”
    想想看，在从前，他们会说出这种话来吗？可是现在他们都自觉、自愿的说出来了，这证明他们都在进步。后退是走不通的，只有前进！前进！再前进！
    北京人民大团结
    在会议结束的那天下午，宣布聂市长当选了，我们都高兴的在笑，一直到夜晚把这欢笑带到了餐厅。
    要吃饭了，首先工人代表向学生代表敬酒，我们乐的有人站到凳子上了。每个人都举起了一杯酒在高呼：“工人阶级万岁！”
    彭真同志、张副市长、农民代表……我们向他们敬酒，他们向我们敬酒，然后又一起向妇女代表敬酒，酒杯在空中摇摆，听不出来是谁在笑，是谁在说，总之，一片欢呼、友爱，象一个永不能消灭的力量。
    这时候我想高呼：“北京人民大团结万岁！”
    走向胜利
    通过这次会议，我进一步的了解了政府，它确是在给我们作事，并且我得到了许多思想上的教育，我知道作事一定要象这次会议一样的有计划，并且任何时候都不脱离群众，随时都要听取群众的意见，要相信群众。
