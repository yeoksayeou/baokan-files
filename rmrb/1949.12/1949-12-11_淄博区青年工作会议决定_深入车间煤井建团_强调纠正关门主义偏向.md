　　【山东讯】 Youth League Zibo Industrial and Mining Special Zone Working Committee, held a Youth Work Conference on November 25th to discuss the work of building the League in factories and mines. The conference summarized and reported on the League building work from August to November, and arranged and discussed the work tasks from December to February of next year. The conference lasted seven days. During the meeting, everyone believed that the previous League building work had been successful. There are now 1,722 League members in the district, and 96 League branches have been established. League members have played a certain role in the central work called for by the Party, government, and trade unions. For example, the Suncun Coal Mine dug a new pit that is now being mined. When heavy rain threatened to collapse it, League members led the broad masses of workers to rush to protect more than 80 tons of coal. League members such as Che Xisheng, Yuan He, and Yue Ridong disregarded all danger and stood at the forefront during the coal rescue. The League's influence among the masses is gradually expanding, and the broad masses of progressive young activists are eager to join the League. The League's work has further attracted the attention of the Party, government, and all parties. However, because the League's leading bodies have not been established in a timely manner, a period of work in the past has not been arranged, summarized, and inspected in a timely manner, so the work is in a state of laissez-faire. At the same time, because cadres have not studied and researched League building documents well, there are still many biases and shortcomings in League building work, mainly: (1) The tendency of closed-doorism exists seriously. Most factories and mines have insufficient understanding of the purpose of League building, which is not only to meet the requirements of young activists, but more importantly to unite and educate the broad masses of young people. Therefore, the League's various activities cannot lead the masses, and the activities of individual leagues are isolated and prominent, and the requirements for joining the League are too high. (2) The previous League building work was mainly in organs and schools. There are very few League members in factories and mines. Among the 1,722 League members in the district, there are only 456 League members and 13 League branches in factories and mines, while there are 41 branches and 779 League members in organs and schools (the rest are in rural areas). The Hongshan Coal Mine has more than 5,000 workers, but not a single League member; among the eleven factories in Zhoucun City with a good foundation, there is only one League member, and the remaining 131 League members are all from organs and schools. At the same time, some League members in factories and mines are not mainly placed among workers and technical workers in workshops and coal mines, but among staff and cadres; in the Suncun Coal Mine, there are 45 League members, but only two in the coal mine, and in Xinbo, there are 29 League members, but not a single coal miner.

　　In future work, we should clarify the policy of "mobilizing the masses" and "building the League in the movement," closely focusing on the task of restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production, and according to the specific situation of Zibo, determine that the focus of League building must be on factories and mines, especially public factories and mines (but we must not ignore rural and private factories and mines), and go deep into workshops and coal mines to develop League members and establish League organizations. In terms of specific tasks, the conference arranged: (1) Through the Party's central work, according to different regions, correctly grasp the standards for joining the League, and carry out gradual and large-scale development of the League. In places where conditions are better, the League has a strong foundation, a greater influence, publicity is more extensive and in-depth, and a large number of activists have emerged in various works called for by the Party, the League's organization should be developed on a large scale; where conditions are better, but the League has not yet been established, League branches should be established quickly, and gradually developed, and actively create conditions to lay the foundation for large-scale development of the League. Where various works are relatively weak and the masses are less aware, workers and young workers should be mobilized in the work to improve workers' awareness, carry out publicity according to the specific ideological situation of employees, and gradually establish League organizations according to conditions. (2) With the League as the core, extensively unite and educate the broad masses of young people, actively participate in the central works called for by the Party, government, and trade unions, such as increasing production and building factories, clearing assets and saving expenses. League members should play an exemplary role in these works, and require the League's organization not only to make general calls and general education, but also to achieve specific organization and specific leadership, and truly become a powerful assistant to the Party. (3) Strengthen the learning and cultural and recreational leadership of League members and the broad masses of young people, so that League members and the masses of young people can be educated in various activities, and strengthen League Day activities, so that League life can be more vivid and lively.

　　淄博区青年工作会议决定
  　深入车间煤井建团
  　强调纠正关门主义偏向
    【山东讯】青年团淄博工矿特区工作委员会，于十一月二十五日召开青年工作会议，讨论工厂矿山的建团工作。会上总结汇报了八月至十一月的建团工作，布置讨论了十二月至明年二月的工作任务。会议历时七日。会议中大家认为过去的建团工作是有成绩的，现在全区已有一七二二名团员，建立了九十六个团支部，团员在党、政与工会所号召的中心工作中，都起了一定的作用，如孙村煤矿挖了一个新坑，正在开采中，天下大雨将要倒塌，团员带领广大工人，抢炭八十余吨车希生、元何、岳日栋等团员，在抢炭中皆不顾一切危险，站在最前头。团在群众中的影响逐渐扩大，广大进步青年积极分子，迫切要求入团，团的工作更进一步引起了党政及各方面的重视。但由于团的领导机构没能及时建立，过去一段工作没能及时布置总结检查，因而工作处于自流状态；同时由于干部对建团文件学习研究差，因而使建团工作还存在着许多偏向及缺点，主要是：（一）关门主义的偏向严重存在。绝大部分工厂矿山的团，对建团的目的，不仅要满足青年积极分子的要求，而更重要的是团结教育广大青年群众认识不足，因而团的各种活动，不能带领群众，个别团的活动陷于孤立突出，入团条件过高。（二）过去的建团工作主要是在机关学校，工厂矿山的支部里团员还很少，全区一七二二名团员中，工厂矿山只有四五六个团员，十三个团支部，而机关学校有四十一个支部，七七九个团员（余者是农村）。洪山煤矿有工人五千余，一个团员也没有；周村市大小有工作基础的十一个工厂中只有一个团员，其余一三一名团员皆是机关学校的，同时有些工厂、矿山的团员，不是主要放在车间煤井工人及技术工人中，而是放在职员干部中；孙村煤矿四十五个团员，煤井内只有二人，新博二十九个团员井内挖煤工人一个也没有。
    在今后工作上，应明确“发动群众”“在运动中建团”的方针，紧紧地围绕恢复发展工业农业生产的任务，并根据淄博的具体情况，确定建团的重点必须放在工厂矿山，特别是公营工厂矿山（但也不能忽视农村与私营工厂矿山），深入到车间煤井中发展团员，建立团的组织。在具体任务上，会议布置是：（一）通过党的中心工作，根据不同地区，正确掌握入团标准，进行逐步与大量发展团，在条件较好、团的基础较强、影响较大、宣传较广泛深入，并在党所号召的各种工作中，涌现出大批积极分子的地方，应大量发展团的组织；条件较好、而团还没有建立起来的，应迅速建立起团支部，逐步发展，积极创造条件，以打下大量发展团的基础，各种工作比较弱，群众觉悟差的，应在工作中发动工人与青工，提高工人觉悟，根据职工的具体思想情况，进行宣传，根据条件逐步建立团的组织。（二）以团为核心，广泛团结教育广大青年群众，积极参加党、政、工会所号召的：增产建厂、清资节约等中心工作，团员在这些工作中，要起模范带头作用，并要求团的组织不仅是一般号召，泛泛教育，而且要做到具体组织，具体领导，真正成为党的有力助手。（三）加强团员及广大青年群众的学习与文化娱乐的领导，使团员与青年群众在各种活动中受到教育，并加强团日活动，使团内生活，过的更生动活泼。
