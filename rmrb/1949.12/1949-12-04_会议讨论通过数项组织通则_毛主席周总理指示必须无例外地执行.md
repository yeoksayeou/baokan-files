　　The meeting then discussed and passed three organizational guidelines for people's representative conferences at the municipal, county, and provincial levels, as well as organizational guidelines for the State Council and its subordinate organs. During the discussion, Premier Zhou and Chairman Mao briefly explained the significance of the organizational guidelines for people's representative conferences at the municipal, county, and provincial levels. Premier Zhou said: People's representative conferences are the best way for the people's government to connect with and mobilize the masses in the early days of liberation, and no excuses should be used to refuse to convene such meetings. The three organizational guidelines do not contain detailed regulations in order to facilitate adaptation to local conditions. It is not appropriate to demand detailed regulations at this time. Chairman Mao said: The promulgation of these organizational guidelines is of great importance. These organizational guidelines are suitable and universally applicable laws for the current period. Although local people's governments can make additions according to specific circumstances, they must be implemented without exception.

　　会议讨论通过数项组织通则
  　毛主席周总理指示必须无例外地执行
    会议接着讨论通过了市的、县的和省的各界人民代表会议的三个组织通则和政务院及其所属各机关组织通则。在讨论时，周总理和毛主席对市县省各界代表会议的组织通则的意义作了简要的说明。周总理说：各界人民代表会议是解放初期人民政府联系群众动员群众的最好方法，不应利用任何借口拒绝召开这样的会议。三种组织通则都未作详密的规定，是为了便于因地制宜，现在要求详密规定是不合宜的。毛主席说：颁布这些组织通则有很大的重要性。这些组织通则就是目前时期适合的通用的法律，各地方人民政府虽然可以按照具体情况有所增益，但是必须无例外地执行。
