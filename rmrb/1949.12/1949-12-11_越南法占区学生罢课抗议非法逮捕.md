Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 10th: A strike by Vietnamese students which began on November 27th in Hanoi has, according to Reuters, spread to all large, medium, and small schools in the French-occupied provinces as of December 6th. Vietnam News Agency reports that the strike began in Hanoi after the French rulers there groundlessly arrested two college students, accusing them of being responsible for the desertion of two foreign legion soldiers. This action by the French authorities aroused the anger of all the students in Hanoi, and students at various universities and middle schools there began a strike on November 27th. As the strike spread to the French-occupied provinces, the puppet government in the French-occupied areas ordered the striking students to report to their schools within eighteen days, or face expulsion. However, the strike is still ongoing.

　　越南法占区学生罢课抗议非法逮捕
    【新华社北京十日电】十一月二十七日在河内开始的越南学生的罢课，据路透社报道，截至十二月六日止，已扩及法国占领区各省的一切大中小学校。越南通讯社消息称：此次罢课首先在河内开始，该地法国统治者曾无故逮捕某高等学校两名学生，借口该两学生应对两外国军团士兵的逃亡负责。法国当局的这一举动激起了河内全体学生的愤怒，该地各大学中学学生遂于十一月二十七日开始罢课。当罢课已蔓延至法占区各省时，法占区傀儡政府曾下令罢课学生须于十八天内向学校报到，否则开除学籍。但是，罢课仍在坚持中。
