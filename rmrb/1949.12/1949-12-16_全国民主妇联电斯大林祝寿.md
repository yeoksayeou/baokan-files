Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 15th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation recently sent a cable to Marshal Stalin to congratulate him on his birthday. The full text is as follows:

Dearest Marshal Stalin:

On December 21st, your 70th birthday, we, on behalf of the women of the People's Republic of China, extend our highest respects to you, the great mentor of the cause of human liberation worldwide, and warmly wish you boundless longevity!

Due to the establishment of the great Soviet Socialist Republic, it has not only laid the foundation for the cause of liberation of the proletariat worldwide, but also become a strong fortress for oppressed nations and oppressed masses around the world to overcome all enemies. In particular, the equal rights enjoyed by Soviet women in all aspects and the happy lives of women and children have become the goals of struggle for women worldwide seeking liberation. The people of all of China, after more than a hundred years of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, have finally defeated internal and external enemies and established their own country—the People's Republic of China. This should be thanked to the great Soviet Union for its assistance to us. At the same time, the Chinese people will always remember that the reason why we can achieve today's victory is mainly due to your wise instructions, which made us understand how to arm the people and overthrow the armed counter-revolutionaries.

Now that we celebrate your 70th birthday, we must make unremitting efforts to learn from the rich experience of Soviet construction. Chinese women are dedicating everything they have to the people's motherland, and following closely behind the advanced Soviet sisters, joining hands with the sisters in the world's peace and democracy camp to fight for world democracy and peace!

　　全国民主妇联电斯大林祝寿
    【新华社北京十五日电】中华全国民主妇女联合会顷致电斯大林大元帅祝寿，全文如下：亲爱的斯大林大元帅：
    十二月二十一日为您的七十大寿，我们谨代表中华人民共和国的妇女，向全世界人类解放事业的伟大导师的您致以崇高的敬礼，热烈地祝您万寿无疆！
    由于伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国的建立，不仅给全世界无产阶级解放事业奠定了基础，而且成为了全世界被压迫民族被压迫群众战胜一切敌人的坚强堡垒；尤其是苏联妇女在各方面所享受的平等权利和妇女儿童的幸福生活，更成为全世界妇女求解放的奋斗目标。我们全中国的人民，经过一百多年来反帝反封建的斗争，终于战胜了内外敌人而建立了自己的国家——中华人民共和国，这应当要感谢伟大的苏联所给予我们的援助；同时，中国人民将永远记着，我们之所以能取得今天的胜利，主要是由于您英明的指示，使我们懂得武装人民，去打倒武装的反革命。
    现在我们庆贺您的七十大寿，更要以不懈的努力来学习苏联建设的丰富经验。中国妇女正把自己的一切贡献于人民的祖国，并紧随着先进的苏联姊妹们之后，与世界和平民主阵营的姊妹们携手并肩地为世界的民主和平而奋斗！
  　　　　　　中华全国民主妇女联合会　十二月十五日
