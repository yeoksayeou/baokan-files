　　Overcoming Floods and Ensuring Coal Supply
    ——A Record of Drainage and Production in the Jingxi Mining Area
    Ji Gang
    By the beginning of December, the state-owned coal mines in Mentougou, Chengzi, and Xishan in the Jingxi mining area, as well as private mines and kilns, had basically overcome the floods and gradually resumed normal production. In the future, they will more fully supply coal for industrial use and fuel in Beijing and Tianjin. More than 19,000 workers from 159 state-owned and private coal mines and kilns in the entire mining area, under the leadership of the Jingxi Coal Mining Company, the Beijing Coal Miners' Union, and the Jingxi Mining Bureau, actively drained water and worked hard to produce coal in an organized and planned manner. Currently, the daily coal production of the entire mining area has reached more than 4,000 tons, and it is increasing daily. This year's annual output can reach more than 980,000 tons (380,000 tons from state-owned mines and more than 600,000 tons from private mines), which is sufficient to meet the needs. Today, there is no longer the dangerous scene of mountain floods raging four months ago, but instead, shiny black coal is piled up like mountains, with both fine and large pieces filling the pits and valleys. These harvests are all glorious achievements of the miners' struggle with nature.
    Concentrating All Efforts to Organize Drainage
    Four months ago, the people in the entire mining area had a weight on their minds, but today it has finally been lifted. Whenever coal kilns are mentioned, the miners say in unison, "It wasn't easy. This year, the Mentougou mining area in Jingxi concentrated all its manpower and financial resources, and really fought the mountain floods. Production was not affected much." Both state-owned and private mines had paid attention to flood prevention projects and strengthened various flood prevention equipment before the summer. Since July 10, due to the floods from the Dayu Gully in the southern part of the mining area and the result of indiscriminate mining and excavation by private kilns, the underground rainwater in the mines and kilns rose sharply. At that time, the rainfall reached 885.6 millimeters, exceeding that of previous years, and the water势 (shì) increased daily. The Jingxi Coal Mining Company promptly mobilized its employees to install water pumps in Mentougou Mine (where all the accumulated water underground in the mining area was collected) to pump water in large quantities. At that time, the Jingxi Mining Bureau organized private kilns to jointly drain water, and the miners continued to mine coal in the unflooded areas. By early August, the water势 (shì) had increased unabated. Mentougou Mine decided to withdraw the machinery from the 1,100-foot and 900-foot coal seams (the iron rolling mill in the 900-foot coal seam was not withdrawn). Due to the increased awareness and high production enthusiasm of the miners, on August 22, the flood once submerged the 600-foot level, and the mine had become a pool of water. However, the miners were still half-submerged in the water, risking their lives to drain water and strive to produce coal. The company also decided not to withdraw the machinery and concentrated all its efforts on drainage. All 21 water pumps in Mentougou Mine drained water together. The maximum inflow of water was 100 tons per minute, while the drainage volume was only 38 tons per minute. Later, after the Party, the government, and the trade union called on all employees to treat drainage work as a combat task and strengthened drainage work, more than 300 workers drained water day and night, averaging 52,000 tons of water drained per day, and as a result, the flood was finally discharged. As a result, the private kilns were also able to avoid being washed away by the water and were able to maintain continuous coal production. After October, the water volume gradually decreased, and drainage became more active. Today, only 12 water pumps are used for drainage. The inflow of water is more than 6 tons per minute, and the drainage volume is more than 37 tons per minute. It is estimated that the 900-foot coal seam can be drained by next spring. Currently, the water has been drained below 600 feet, and coal is being mined in the 600-foot, 450-foot, and 320-foot coal seams. Although Mentougou Mine was flooded, thanks to the active efforts of more than 2,600 miners in the mine's 17 production teams, machine rooms, and loading and transportation sections to overcome difficulties and work day and night, coal production reached 3,201 tons in September, and increased to 8,117 tons in November. It is estimated that 10,000 tons of coal can be produced in December. Chengzi Mine was not flooded and produces more than 200 tons per day. Xiaheishan produces more than 200 tons per day. Only Sishan Mine is still flooded, and production is not high.
    Some people say: Mentougou Mine is the "Water Control Company" of the Jingxi mining area, which is true. It undertakes all the drainage projects in the entire mining area. However, due to the excessive water this year, the Jingxi Mining Bureau also led and organized 57 small kilns in the western mining area to sign a contract with the Jingxi Coal Mining Company to set up three 50-horsepower water pumps in the western slope area of Chengzi Village, the buffer sealing area of Longmen State-owned Mine, and the western area of Quanmen to drain water on their behalf. In addition, they are also organizing joint drainage. During this period, thanks to the efforts of more than 14,000 employees of various private mines and kilns and the support of the municipal government in the form of batch purchases and fixed-order loans, the private mines and kilns were able to resume and develop production as soon as possible. The output of private mines and kilns was 27,786 tons in September and increased to 62,944 tons in November. It is estimated that 100,500 tons can be produced in December. This month, 50 private kilns that had been shut down are preparing to start mining. It is estimated that by the end of the month, private kilns in the entire mining area can produce more than 5,000 tons of coal per day.
    Leadership and Support
    Before the rainy season, the municipal government made a general estimate of this year's kiln flooding problem based on the past years' situation and gave specific instructions. State-owned and private mines paid attention to flood prevention projects. State-owned mines built sluice gates and increased flood prevention equipment, etc. Private mines and kilns built flood prevention walls, river channels, and filled pits and repaired cracks, etc., which achieved certain flood prevention effects. When carrying out drainage work, they grasped the situation in a timely manner, relied on the masses, decided on methods, mobilized the masses, and carried out work. Mentougou Mine also dug three inclined shafts in Xiaheishan and vigorously supported the development of small kilns in the western private mining area, introducing private kilns to approve coal and loans. This planned and step-by-step work avoided the phenomenon of being caught off guard when the kiln was flooded, resulting in the interruption of production and the occurrence of coal shortages. It enabled the drainage project to be completed steadily, thereby ensuring the supply of fuel coal.
    After overcoming the floods, the production of the mining area has entered a stage of recovery and development. In the future, the government should strengthen its leadership more vigorously. It should enable the entire Jingxi mining area to have greater development in order to strongly support the construction of the people's capital.
    State-owned Mines Formulate Next Year's Production Plan
    The 1950 production plans of the state-owned mines have been formulated at a meeting convened by the Jingxi Coal Mining Company in early December. The mines are now separately inviting various units in the mines to discuss and formulate specific work plans. The planned annual output for next year is 807,880 tons. If the kiln is flooded, the output will be 653,880 tons. The state-owned coal mines also decided to focus on the Liangxiang project. Datai and Liangxiang will make various preparations in the first half of the year and carry out large-scale mining in the second half of the year. Chengzi Mine will strengthen underground engineering. In order to complete the production tasks, the Mentougou Mining Area Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a production mobilization meeting for all Party members and Youth League members in the entire mining area on December 17, calling on all Party members and Youth League members to overcome difficulties and complete the 1950 production tasks, rely on the close unity of the employees of the mines, discuss and formulate production plans, and work together to do a good job in production. It also called on all Party members and Youth League members to save raw materials and utilize waste materials in production, be actively responsible, and take the lead in completing production tasks. At present, when formulating next year's work plans, the mines have also invited old workers and skilled workers from the mines to study and formulate them. The employees have expressed that only by working together to find solutions can we surely complete the production tasks victoriously.

　　战胜水患保证用煤
    ——记京西矿区的排水与生产情形
    纪刚
    京西矿区门头沟、城子、西山各公营煤矿及私营矿、窑，到十二月初，基本上战胜了水患，逐渐恢复正常生产，今后将更充分地供应京、津两地工业用煤及燃煤。全矿区公营各矿及私营煤窑一百五十九家的职工一万九千多人，在京西煤矿公司、北京市煤矿工会、京西矿务处领导下，有组织、有计划地积极排水，努力生产，目前全矿区每日产煤量已达四千余吨，且正在逐日增加中；今年年产量可达九十八万余吨公营三十八万吨、私营六十余区（万吨），足够所需。今日矿内，已无四个多月前山洪汹涌岌岌可危的景象，而是乌金墨玉，堆积成山，高末大块，满坑满谷，这些收获都是矿工们和自然斗争的辉煌战果。
    集中全力组织排水
    四个多月前，全矿区的人们心里系着一块七上八下的石头，今天算落了地。一提起煤窑来，矿工都异口同声地说：“不容易，今年京西门头沟矿区集中了全部人力、财力，真把山洪斗争得痛快，生产没受啥影响。”公私营各矿早于夏季前即曾注意防水工程，加强各种防水设备。自七月十日起，各矿窑由于矿区南部大峪沟来洪和平日私窑滥采乱挖破坏矿区的结果，井下雨水猛涨，当时降雨量达八百八十五点六公厘，超过往年，水势逐日汹猛。京西煤矿公司乃及时发动职工，在门矿按置水泵（全矿区井下积水汇集门矿）大量抽水；是时，京西矿务处组织各私窑联合排水，矿工仍在未淹地区采煤。至八月初，水势有增无已，门矿决定将一千一百英尺、九百英尺两处煤层机器撤上（九百英尺煤层铁轧未撤）。由于矿工们的觉悟提高，生产情绪极高，八月二十二日洪水一度淹到六百英尺，矿中已成一片水塘，而矿工们仍半身淹在水中，冒险排水力争出煤，公司亦决定不再撤上机器，集中全力排水。门矿二十一个水泵一齐排水，来水量最高时每分钟一百吨，而排水量每分钟仅三十八吨，后经党、政、工号召全体职工把排水工作当做战斗任务，加强了排水工作，三百多工人排水昼夜不停，每天平均排水五万二千吨，结果终将洪水泄下。各私营小窑亦因此避免被水冲淹，能保持继续出煤。十月以后水量陆续减少，排水更趋积极，至今只用十二个水泵排水，每分钟水的来量为六吨多，排水量每分钟为三十七吨多，估计到明年春天可排至九百英尺煤层。目前已排水六百英尺以下，已在六百英尺、四百五十英尺、三百二十英尺煤层采煤。门矿虽被水淹，但由于全矿十七个生产组及机器房、装运股等单位二千六百余矿工积极克服困难，昼夜努力生产，九月份产煤即达三千二百零一吨，至十一月份即增至八千一百十七吨，预计十二月份可产煤一万吨。城子矿未被水淹，日产二百多吨。小黑山日产二百余吨，只有四山矿仍被水淹，产量不多。
    有人说：门矿是京西矿区的“治水公司”，一点不假，全矿区的排水工程都由它包揽了，但是，由于今年水势过大，京西矿务处又领导与组织矿区西部五十七家小窑，与京西煤矿公司订立合同，在城子村西坡地区、龙门公矿缓封地区及圈门西部地区设五十马力的水泵三个代为排水，此外他们自己也正在组织联合排水。在此期间，由于各私营矿窑一万四千余职工的努力生产，和市政府以批购及定货贷款等方式的扶植，使各私营矿窑得以早日恢复发展生产。各私营矿窑产量，九月份为二万七千七百八十六吨，十一月份已增至六万二千九百四十四吨，十二月份估计可产十万零五千吨，本月内还有曾停工的五十家私窑准备动工开采，估计至月底，全矿区私窑每日可产煤五千多吨。
    领导与扶植
    市政府于雨季前对今年淹窑问题，根据过去历年情况，作了一般估计，并作了具体指示。公私营各矿注意了防水工程，公营矿修建水闸门、增修防水设备等，私营各矿窑修建防水墙、河道水渠、填坑补裂等，收到一定防水效果。在展开排水工作时，及时掌握情况，依靠群众，决定办法，发动群众，开展工作。门矿另于小黑山开凿三斜井，并大力扶植发展西部私营矿区各小窑，介绍私窑批煤、贷款。这样有计划，有步骤的工作，避免了窑淹时措手不及而生产中断、发生煤荒的现象。使排水工程稳步地完成，进而保证了燃煤的供应。
    战胜水患后，矿区的生产已进入恢复和发展的阶段，政府今后更应大力加强领导。使整个京西矿区有更大的发展，以有力的支持人民首都的建设工作。
    公营各矿拟定明年生产计划
    公营各矿一九五○年的生产计划，已经京西煤矿公司于十二月初召集各矿开会拟出，各矿刻正分别邀集矿上各单位研商拟定具体工作计划。明年全年产量计划为八十万七千八百八十吨，如窑被水淹，产量为六十五万三千八百八十吨。公营煤矿并决定以良乡工程为重点，大台、良乡上半年做各项准备工作，下半年大量开采。城子矿加强井下工程。为了完成生产任务，中共门头沟矿区党委于十二月十七日召集全矿区党、团员开生产动员大会，号召全体党、团员克服困难，完成一九五○年生产任务，依靠各矿职工紧密团结，讨论制订生产计划，大家齐心把生产搞好。并号召全体党、团员，在生产中节省原料，利用废料；积极负责，带头完成生产任务。目前各矿在制订明年工作计划时，亦已邀集各矿老工人，熟练工人研究拟定。职工们纷纷表示：只有大家共同想办法，一定能把生产任务胜利完成。
