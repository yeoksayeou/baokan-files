　　Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax and Business Tax
　　Beijing to Start Levying on the 6th
　　Industry Fractions to be Officially Announced Today
　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Committee for Promoting the unified collection of profit-seeking enterprise income tax and business tax has decided to commence the collection from the 6th of this month. The equivalent value of one jin of rice is set at 600 yuan, and the industry fractions will be officially announced today (the 3rd). After more than a month of investigation and evaluation, the Municipal Committee for Promotion held its seventh meeting the day before yesterday, where it finalized the specific issues of collection time and payment methods. All committee members expressed satisfaction with the municipal government's setting of the rice price at 600 yuan, considering it to be a quarter lower than the market price, in consideration of the burden on various industrial and commercial businesses. The collection period is set to begin on the 6th and end on the 25th, lasting for 20 days. After ten days, the rice price will be appropriately adjusted based on the prevailing price situation (but to encourage early payment, the rice price will not be lowered even if prices fall). Industrial and commercial businesses with actual difficulties can pay in two installments within the deadline. At the meeting, the representative of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China stated that the bank is actively planning to increase the number of payment locations to facilitate payments for industrial and commercial businesses, and will be open as usual on Saturday afternoons and Sundays; however, they hope that all industrial and commercial businesses will not delay payment until the last minute and will organize their payments in order to save time. The tax targets include 150 industries (20 industrial and 130 commercial), totaling 33,787 businesses, with an actual fraction of 1,997,917, not including businesses that opened after July of this year. Public enterprises, individual members (those not participating in trade associations), and the four districts of Mentougou, Nanyuan, Changxindian, and Fengtai have been assessed separately. This tax collection includes provisions for a reduction of 10% to 40% for industries and businesses with special benefits for the national economy and the people's livelihood or those particularly needed by Beijing.

　　营利事业所得税与营业税
  　京市六日开征
    各业分数今可正式公布
    【北京讯】北京市统一征收营利事业所得税与营业税工作，市推进委员会已决定自本月六日起开始征收，每斤米价折款六百元，各业分数定于今（三）日正式公布。在经过月余的调查与评议，前日市推进委员会开第七次会议时，就征收时间与缴款方法的具体问题作了最后的讨论。各委员对市府为照顾各工商业户负担而定的六百元米价，认为已较市价低达四分之一，都表示满意。征收时间，决定自六日开始，至二十五日止，为期二十天。十天后，按当时物价情况，适当调整米价一次（但为鼓励早缴，即使物价降落，米价不再降低）。如有实际困难之工商业户，在期限内可分两次缴纳。会上，人民银行北京分行代表表示：为使工商业户缴款方便，银行正在积极筹划增设缴款处，星期六下午与星期将照常办公；但希望各工商户勿将缴款时间拖在最后，并将票款整理好，以节省时间。征税对象计有一百五十行业（内工业二十，商业一百三十），三万三千七百八十七户，实际分数一百九十九万七千九百一十七分，不包括今年七月份以后的开业户。公营企业、单独会员（不参加公会者）及门头沟、南苑、长辛店、丰台四区已另行评议。此次征税，对于国计民生有特殊利益或为北京市所特别需要之工商业，有百分之十到百分之四十的减征规定。
