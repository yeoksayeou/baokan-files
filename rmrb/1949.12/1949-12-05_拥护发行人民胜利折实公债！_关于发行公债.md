    Support the Issuance of the People's Victory Discount Bond!
　　On the Issuance of Government Bonds
    Mao Dun
    The issuance of the People's Victory Public Bonds precisely demonstrates the government's genuinely responsible spirit in serving the people, and it precisely demonstrates the government's consideration for the overall interests of the people in everything it does. After reading Vice Premier Chen Yun's report on the issue of commodity prices and the issuance of public bonds, everyone can see the government's spirit of considering the overall interests of the people and being genuinely responsible. We do not shy away from the fact that price fluctuations are due to the increase in issuance, nor do we shy away from the fact that the state treasury will have difficulties next year; however, we should all more firmly recognize that "this difficulty is a difficulty in victory, and this burden is a burden of victory" and can inevitably be overcome. We must have this confidence, and firmly establish this confidence. Looking again at Minister Bo Yibo's report on the draft estimate of national fiscal revenue and expenditure for 1950, we can also know that under the circumstances of financial difficulties, investment in state-owned enterprises will still account for 23.9 percent of the total expenditure for the year. Investment in state-owned enterprises here includes industrial, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and transportation construction projects, and the total amount of this investment is compared with the total amount of victory public bonds issued, the total amount of public bonds issued is only equivalent to less than one-third of the total investment of enterprises, and therefore, we can also know that the victory public bonds are indeed constructive and absolutely different from the past Chinese public bonds. We will look at the report of Vice Chairman Li Fuchun of the Northeast People's Government on the Northeast Fiscal and Economic Plan for 1950, and we will know that as long as the war ends, there are ways to overcome financial difficulties, and economic recovery and construction will not be difficult to

    拥护发行人民胜利折实公债！
　　关于发行公债
    茅盾
    人民胜利公债的发行，正表示了政府为人民办事的切实负责的精神，正表示了政府处处为人民的全般利益着想。读了陈云副总理对于物价问题与发行公债的报告，大家都可以看到政府的这种为人民的全般利益着想和切实负责的精神。我们并不讳言物价的波动是由于发行的增加，也并不讳言明年度国家财政有困难；然而我们大家更应确实地认识，“这种困难是胜利中的困难，这个负担，是胜利的负担”，必然能够克服。我们必须有这信心，并且坚定这信心。再看薄一波部长关于一九五○年度全国财政收支概算草案编成的报告，又可以知道，在财政困难的情形下，明年度国营企业的投资仍占全年总支出百分之二十三点九，这里的国营企业投资包括工业、农林水利、交通建设等项目，而这投资的总数如与胜利公债发行的总数相比较，则公债发行的总数仅相当于企业投资总数三分之一弱，因此，我们又可以知道，胜利公债确实是建设性的，绝对不同于过去的中国公债。我们再看东北人民政府李富春副主席关于一九五○年度东北财政经济计划的报告，就又知道只要战争一结束，财政困难是有办法克服的，经济的恢复和建设是不难逐步实现的。毛主席对我们指示：“我们的情况，会一年比一年好起来，估计明年要比今年好。在三年五年的时间内，我们的经济可以完全恢复，在十年八年的时间内，我们的经济就可以得到巨大的发展。”毛主席的科学的预见，向来是完全兑现的。我们要使得广大人民知道我们国家财政困难的所在，以及克服困难的办法，拥护明年度的财政收支概算，拥护胜利公债。
