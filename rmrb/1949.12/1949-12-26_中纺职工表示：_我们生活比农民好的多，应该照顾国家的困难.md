　　Textile Workers of China Express: "Our lives are much better than the peasants', we should take care of the country's difficulties"
    [By Our Newspaper] Shanghai China Textile factories' workers enthusiastically discussed the government's method of handling year-end double pay and bonuses and unanimously expressed their support. The Trade Union of China Textile Factory No. 9 convened a general meeting of all Class A, Class B, and Long Day Shift workers on the 19th. The head of the trade union conveyed the government's and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' resolutions to the workers, and explained them specifically to the workers by comparing them with the lives of the People's Liberation Army and the peasants. It received enthusiastic support from the workers on the spot, and all raised their hands to express their agreement. Chen Zuocai, a worker from the roving frame section, excitedly ran to the front and said: "Our lives are much better than the peasants'. They are still actively supporting the front lines. Can we, the working class, lag behind? We firmly support the government's regulations." Pan Fengying, a worker from the spinning frame section, also said: "Now that the country is in difficulty, we should take care of it." Tang Guangxi, a worker from the weaving machine section, said: "I originally wanted to buy a pair of leather shoes, but now I won't. Now that the government's economy is in difficulty, we should endure a little hardship."
    China Textile Factory No. 15 also carried out explanatory and persuasive work among the workers. At the general meeting of all workers in the long day shift, the trade union comrades reported the resolution of the Central Finance and Economics Committee on the annual bonus, publicly read the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' letter to the workers of the whole country, and used specific facts to publicize and explain to the workers. After heated discussions, all the workers unanimously raised their hands to express their agreement. The workers of the spinning frame maintenance department also took the lead in shouting: "We support the government's resolution!" "We will always follow Chairman Mao!"
