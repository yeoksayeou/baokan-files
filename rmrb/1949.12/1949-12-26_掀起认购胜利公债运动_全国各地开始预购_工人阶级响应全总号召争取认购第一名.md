Launching a Campaign to Subscribe to Victory Bonds
	Pre-sales Begin Across the Country
    The Working Class Responds to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Call to Strive for First Place in Subscriptions
[Reported by this newspaper] The movement to support the Central People's Government's issuance of People's Victory Indexed Bonds is unfolding across the country and has entered the pre-subscription phase. The Shanghai Municipal Engineering Union's Shanghai Electric Power Company and British Tramway Company branches held executive committee meetings on the 20th and 21st, respectively, to discuss the promotion of bonds. Shen Xiang-sheng, director of the Shanghai Electric Power Company Union, took the lead in subscribing for 50 units, followed by Jiang Xiang-sheng, a laboratory engineer, who subscribed for 250 units. The number of subscriptions reached 1,070 units on the same day. A subscription competition unfolded at the British Tramway Company Union Executive Committee meeting. Worker Zou Xue-li was the first to express his intention to subscribe to bonds with one-third of his year-end bonus. Zhou Fa-fu then proposed to subscribe with half of his bonus, and Qi Shi-can expressed his intention to subscribe with two-thirds of his year-end bonus. Twenty people at the meeting expressed their intention to subscribe to bonds with most or part of their bonuses. Furthermore, Li Chang-fu, Tao Qi-ming, Bao Han, and 11 other workers from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ship Repair Factory have decided to subscribe to bonds with their entire year-end bonuses.

More than 20 cadres of the Zhengzhou Railway General Union's Xi'an Branch Preparatory Committee pre-purchased 50 units at a study meeting. According to incomplete statistics, all employees of the Xi'an Mass Daily First Printing Factory have subscribed for more than 120 units, and the effort is currently expanding. The subscriptions of the editorial staff also reached 100 units. More than 80 wounded and sick People's Liberation Army soldiers recuperating in a rear hospital in Xi'an unanimously stated: The People's Republic of China, which we exchanged for with blood, is our own country, and we must cherish it with practical actions. These wounded soldiers have saved their allowances to buy bonds and have put forward the slogan of recuperating well so that they can participate in production work as soon as possible. The various specialized committees of the Xi'an People's Representative Conference are jointly preparing to organize a "Xi'an People's Victory Indexed Bonds Promotion Committee" to lead the people of the city to enthusiastically subscribe to bonds.

The Preparatory Committee of the Ningxia Provincial Federation of Trade Unions notified trade unions throughout the province to study the documents related to the Victory Bonds issued by the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Hui representative Ma Shezhen Ahong said: "We Hui people fully support the Central People's Government's decision to issue bonds."

The Preparatory Committees of the Henan and Hubei Provincial Federations of Trade Unions have issued instructions, and the Central China Workers' Daily has also published an editorial, calling on workers in the two provinces and all provinces in Central China to enthusiastically subscribe to bonds, which has been met with unanimous and enthusiastic response from the workers. The responsible persons of the Hubei Provincial Women's Federation, the Communist Youth League, and the Educational College expressed that they would mobilize women, faculty, and students to promote enthusiastic subscription to bonds to all sectors of society.

The First Congress of Telecommunications Workers in Central China has sent a telegram to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, expressing its support for the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, its firm support for the issuance of People's Victory Bonds, and its commitment to promote the realization of this issuance plan with its utmost efforts.

Wang Jin-ying, a worker at the Zhengzhou Telecommunications Bureau, wrote an article in the Zhengzhou Daily entitled "The Working Class Should Take the Lead in Overcoming Financial Difficulties," calling on workers to help the government overcome difficulties as masters of the country. At the symposium of the Zhengzhou Industrial Advancement Association, initiated by Fu Zi-cheng, director of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Deputy Manager Zhang of the Wah Fei Tobacco Company, a signature campaign for pre-purchasing bonds was launched on the spot, and the number of pre-purchases exceeded 1,000 units.

Employees of Qingdao No. 1 Textile Factory are writing letters to the factory's trade union, expressing their determination to subscribe to bonds with their accumulated wages. Female worker Zhao Lan-yu wrote in her letter: "I was extremely happy to read the call from the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. I feel that this is a duty that should be fulfilled as a master of the country. When the bonds are issued, I will strive to be the first to subscribe." At the discussion meeting held by the Preparatory Committee of the Qingdao Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, Chi Xu-cheng, deputy manager of the privately-owned Zhenye Match Factory, said: The government's policy is to take from the people and use for the people. We should enthusiastically support it and subscribe in large quantities. The association also sent a telegram to the Central People's Government, guaranteeing to enthusiastically subscribe to bonds and strive to accelerate the glorious task of completing the new democratic economic construction. At the symposium held on the 19th by the employees of the Qingdao Merchants Bureau Ship Repair Factory, 54 units of bonds were subscribed. Employees of various public and private enterprises are generally brewing to subscribe, and employees of Zhongfang are proposing guarantees to the trade union to strive to be the first to subscribe.

The members of the Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference of Wuxi Sunan all expressed that they would set an example and call on the people of Sunan to enthusiastically subscribe. Zhou Xiao-hua, deputy director of the Preparatory Committee of the Wuxi Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, spoke on behalf of more than 100,000 workers in the city, saying: Although our workers' lives are difficult, we will save on food and clothing and take the lead in subscribing to bonds.

The Preparatory Committees of the Federations of Industry and Commerce of Suzhou and Changzhou in Jiangsu Province, and Jinhua in Zhejiang Province, have successively sent telegrams to the Central People's Government, expressing their firm support for the government's wise measure to overcome financial difficulties and strive for price stability, and their commitment to actively welcome and complete the glorious tasks that will be assigned to them.
