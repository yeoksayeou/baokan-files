Prevention of Plague Must Start Early
　　Northeast Epidemic Completely Eliminated
　　3.8 Million People Vaccinated, 15 Million Rats Caught

　　[Northeast News] This year, the Northeast achieved great success in preventing and controlling plague and other diseases. Among the five provinces and one city of Zhemeng, Rehe, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoxi, which have experienced plague outbreaks for years, only 417 people contracted plague this year, accounting for 7.6% of last year's total. There were 250 deaths, and the mortality rate decreased by 11.6% compared to last year. As of now, the epidemic has been completely eliminated. Cholera did not occur this year. Although other infectious diseases such as diphtheria and dysentery occurred, they did not spread widely. The major reasons for achieving such great success are: First, the anti-epidemic work was arranged early. The Northeast People's Government Health Department arranged the 1949 anti-epidemic work in the spring, first establishing and improving grassroots organizations (only Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces established grassroots organizations with 13,458 district, village, and town health assistants and health workers), strengthening publicity and education, mobilizing the masses to catch rats and prevent rats, cleaning houses and courtyards, plastering walls and kangs, and building isolation hospitals and central isolation centers. Secondly, the Health Department's mobile anti-epidemic teams and more than 1,900 anti-epidemic personnel directly under the provinces and cities also began work in various epidemic areas in late April. Second, the Soviet anti-epidemic team came to the Northeast before the epidemic occurred (early May) and went deep into Tongliao, Rehe, and other areas to carry out work. With a spirit of internationalism, they worked conscientiously and diligently, assisted in formulating specific anti-epidemic plans, educating cadres, and guiding rat catching, vaccination, diagnosis, isolation, blockade, and treatment, which played a decisive role in preventing and controlling plague. Third, preventive vaccinations were widespread and timely, especially in areas where plague had occurred in the past. Rat vaccines were widely administered. A total of more than 3.86 million people were vaccinated against plague, more than 2.42 million people were vaccinated with cholera-typhoid mixed vaccine, and more than 1.43 million people were vaccinated against smallpox. Fourth, the masses were mobilized to catch rats. A total of more than 14.59 million rats were caught this year, ten times more than last year and 700 times more than the year before last. This not only prevented the spread of plague, but also reduced the loss of more than 26,600 tons of grain (calculated at one qian of grain per rat per day). Fifth, blockade, isolation, disinfection, and other work were thorough, so most of the villages and villages where plague occurred were limited to one or two people, which prevented the spread. However, there are also shortcomings. The main shortcoming is that the prevention of infectious diseases other than plague and cholera is poor. Therefore, some other infectious diseases have occurred throughout the Northeast. Among them, the epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis that occurred in Shenyang City spread for more than two months and spread to all districts of the city. This deserves special attention in the future.

### 防鼠疫须早下手　东北疫情全部解除  注射三百八十万人捕鼠千五百万只

　　防鼠疫须早下手
  　东北疫情全部解除
    注射三百八十万人捕鼠千五百万只
    【东北讯】东北今年防治鼠疫等工作获得巨大成绩。经年发生鼠疫的哲盟、热河、吉林、黑龙江、辽西等五省一市中，今年患鼠疫的仅四一七名，为去年的百分之七点六，死亡二五○名，死亡率比去年减少百分之十一点六，到目前为止，疫情已全部解除。霍乱今年未发生，其他白喉、赤痢等传染病，虽有发生，但未扩大蔓延。获得这样巨大的成绩，主要由于：一、防疫工作布置较早。东北人民政府卫生部于春季就布置了一九四九年防疫工作，首先进行建立与健全基层组织（仅黑龙江、松江等二省就建立了拥有一三、四五八名区、村、屯卫生助理与卫生员的基层组织），加强宣传教育，发动群众捕鼠防鼠、清扫屋院、抹墙抹炕、修建隔离病院及中心隔离所等工作，其次卫生部的机动防疫队及各省市直属防疫人员一千九百余人亦于四月末分别到各疫区开始工作。二、苏联防疫队在疫情未发生前（五月初），即来到东北，深入通辽、热河等地区，进行工作。他们以国际主义精神认真负责艰苦工作，协助制订具体防疫计划，教育干部，指导捕鼠、注射、检诊、隔离、封锁及治疗，对防治鼠疫起了决定作用。三、预防注射普遍及时，特别是以往发生过鼠疫的地区，普遍地注射了鼠疫苗。计注射鼠疫苗的有三百八十六万余人，霍乱伤寒混合疫苗的有二百四十二万余人，接种牛痘的有一百四十三万余人。四、发动群众捕鼠，总计今年捕得一千四百五十九万余只，捕鼠比去年增加十倍，达前年的七百倍。这不仅防止了鼠疫的蔓延，而且少损失二万六千六百余吨粮食（以每只鼠每天吃一钱粮食计算）。五、封锁、隔离、消毒等工作彻底，因此发生鼠疫村屯，大部仅限一、二人，这样就防止了蔓延。但也有缺点，主要的缺点是：对鼠疫、霍乱以外的传染病预防较差，因此全东北发生了一些其他的传染病。其中如沈阳市发生的流行性脊髓脑膜炎，前后蔓延两个多月，遍及全市各区。值得今后特别注意。
