    Telegraph Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Accepting the Leadership of the People's Government
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st] After the liberation of Chongqing, the personnel of the Chongqing Telecommunications Bureau immediately telegraphed Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Premier Zhou of our Central People's Government, reporting on the situation in Chongqing and expressing their acceptance of the leadership of the People's Government and their determination to fight for the complete elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group. The telegram is as follows:
    Chairman Mao of the People's Government, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Premier Zhou: Thanks to your correct leadership and instructions, the people of the Southwest have been liberated one after another. Chongqing, under the ravages of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group who have thrown themselves into the arms of American imperialism, has also been liberated today. However, when the bandit troops retreated in a panic, they disregarded the lives and property of the people and carried out wanton destruction, leaving the people of the entire city with a hatred that will never be forgotten for ten thousand years. From now on, standing under your leadership and instructions, we will definitely fight for the thorough elimination of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group, and strive for the cause of the liberation of all mankind.

    【新华社北京一日电】重庆电信局人员在重庆解放后，立即致电我中央人民政府毛主席、朱总司令、周总理，报告重庆情况，并表示接受人民政府领导，为彻底消灭蒋匪集团而斗争。电文如下：
    人民政府毛主席，朱总司令，周总理：由于你们领导与指示的正确，西南的人民才会陆续得到解放。在投靠美帝国主义的蒋匪集团蹂躏下的重庆，今天也获得解放了。但在匪军狼狈溃退时，不顾人民的生命财产，大肆破坏，给全市人民留下了千万年不能忘记的大仇恨。我们今后站在你们的领导和指示下，一定为澈底消灭帝国主义和蒋匪集团而战，为全人类解放事业而奋斗。
