　　The Black Rock Slope Coal Mine Chronicle (49)

    Everyone offered more suggestions to Da San, and Tianlu also offered two. Then, the cadres also made some self-criticisms, and they proceeded to elect representatives for the poor peasant association. As a result, Shuancheng, Bian Xiao, Tianlu, Bai Quan's family, and a few others were elected. Shuancheng even suggested electing Da San, but most people said that his thinking and temperament were not quite right, and Da San himself said that he wasn't qualified, so he wasn't elected. Finally, everyone decided on several immediate tasks and handed them over to the representatives and the original worker-peasant association to handle, and then the meeting adjourned.
    Next, the first task handled by the worker-peasant association and the representatives was to examine class backgrounds. This was carried out by Lao Yin and cadres like Bian Xiao. In the past, class backgrounds had already been determined in the village, but because the standards for determining class backgrounds were unclear, and because Lao Yin didn't pay attention to the characteristics of the local industrial and mining area, although there weren't any major errors in classifying landlords and rich peasants, there were many inaccuracies in the classification of workers and peasants. For example, people like Tianlu who were half-worker and half-peasant, and Shuancheng and Xiao Yanggui who didn't do anything, had their class backgrounds classified very chaotically. Also, there were people like Taicheng, who didn't have much land, and whose annual income wasn't enough to feed them for more than three to five months, but because there were many laborers in the family, and they went down the kiln to carry coal, their family's life was quite good. This led to them being classified as middle peasants, which wasn't very appropriate. After discussions between Lao Yin, Lao Bai, and the county, and after asking for instructions from higher authorities, the Communist Party Central Committee's document on classifying classes was also published, and the standards became clear. The village then repeatedly discussed and clarified the class backgrounds. Only after this were they able to convene a village-wide worker-peasant congress.
　 This congress lasted for two days. On the first day, based on the opinions voiced in the small group discussions, they dealt with Yubao. At the same time, the county people's court had already sentenced Qian Danao two days prior to three years imprisonment, and released him back to the village to serve his sentence. His return was to solicit the village's opinion. Therefore, the congress also discussed his case. The mistakes he and Yubao confessed to at the congress were much more thorough than in the past, and their words from top to bottom were consistent. The congress decided to agree with the county's judgment on Qian Danao and told him to listen carefully to everyone in the future and work hard in production. As for Yubao, everyone saw that he confessed honestly and admitted to embezzling funds and promised to return as much as he could. The congress decided only to deprive him of his rights as a citizen and to decide when to restore his citizenship based on his future actions. This decision was to be submitted to the district and county for approval. After this decision, Shuancheng also expressed his opinion on Yubao's case. He said: "Yubao was originally a suffering person just like us, but because he didn't take the right path and only learned from the evil path, he was bought by landlords and traitors and used as a lackey to oppress us suffering people in turn. In this way, he became the enemy of us suffering people and committed a great crime against us! But now Yubao has a little understanding, and his bad ideas are also turning towards the good. He has confessed to us, admitted his mistakes, and repeatedly stated that he must follow us on the right path. We welcome his progress! People often say, 'A prodigal son returning home is more precious than gold!' In the future, as long as Yubao sincerely does good deeds and doesn't do bad things, we must also help and support him, just like helping and supporting our brothers and nephews! Does everyone agree or not?" Some people didn't quite agree with this passage, like Da San, but most people nodded in praise and shouted, "Agree!" Yubao himself stood upright with his head down, listening. When he finished listening, he raised his head, and people saw that his eyes were red, and he seemed to be about to shed tears. He said, haltingly, "I... everyone! If I don't... don't change for the... the good... I'm not... not human... Whatever... whatever everyone says... just do... do it..." Lao Yin also gave a speech at the end to educate Yubao, and the meeting adjourned.

    The next day, another congress was held to review the work and decide on the distribution of fruits, land surveying, preparation for land distribution, etc. Finally, everyone unanimously agreed that the whole village and Xilu would immediately start opening the large kiln. The method would first be discussed by the elected people and then discussed further. Anyway, everyone's enthusiasm was very high. In addition, a few more members of the worker-peasant association were added to the cadre team. After the meeting, the village held small meetings and large meetings, comparing lives and classifying grades, enthusiastically dividing up the spoils. It was like a temple fair for five or six days, with every household closing their doors, and men, women, old, and young all mobilized. Everyone said that this was the first great happy event since the beginning of the world, and everyone was busy day and night. Only the few people in the village who were decided to immediately start planning and tidying up the large kiln didn't participate in the distribution of the spoils.
　　　　
    Forty-four Planning
    Here, let's talk about how the village decided that Da San, Tianlu, Taicheng, and Xilu, led by Lao Bai, would plan to tidy up the large kiln. They studied it in and out of the kiln for two days, estimating that there were about 100,000 dan of water stored in the east kiln. Lao Bai went to the Yangquan mine to take a look, wanting to borrow a water pump to drain the water, but he couldn't borrow one from any of the mines. Lao Bai was extremely anxious, but at this moment, Taicheng somehow always seemed listless and kept saying, "This is impossible!" Tianlu kept trying to persuade him, "Don't worry, let's think of a way!" Da San glared and waved his arm, saying, "Now that we're managing our own kiln, how can it be impossible? Humph! Can't we install a 'whirlwind' to drain the water? If we want to do it, we can't give up halfway. We have to be clear about this!" Taicheng quickly said, "Okay! You think of a way, and we'll just follow along!" Taicheng seemed a little angry, and after that, he kept silent and just followed along with the planning. When asked about anything, he would always drawl, "I have no opinion! Anything is fine!" Because others were seriously thinking about everything, they didn't pay attention to him. He also knew how to use the abacus, so they just had him help Xilu calculate and calculate.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（４９）
    康濯
    大家又给大三提了些意见，天禄也提了两条，接着各干部也作了些检讨，就进行选贫农团的代表，结果选上了拴成扁小天禄白泉家和另外几个；拴成并提出了要选大三，但多数人说他思想脾性还不很对付，大三自己也说他够不上资格，因此没选上。最后，大家决定了几件眼下的工作，交由代表会和原来的工农会一道去办，便散了会。
    接着，工农会和代表会办的头一件工作，就是检查成份，这由老尹和扁小等干部负责进行。过去村里本来是划了成份的，但因为划成份的标准不明确，又因为老尹没注意这地区工矿的特点，虽说划地主富农等倒没大的错误，但在工人和农民的划分上，却有好多不大对付的，比如象天禄那样半工半农的和拴成小洋鬼那样什么也干的，成份就划得很乱，还有象泰成那样，地土不多，一年收入不够三五个月吃用，只因家里劳力多，下窑挑扁担一干，一家子光景却挺不赖，这么就给划成了中农：这些都不大合适。经过老尹老白和县里的讨论，并请示了上级，恰好这时共产党中央关于划阶级的文件又公布了，标准也明确了，村里就又进行反复咯嚷讨论，把成份划清。这以后才召开了全村工人农民的大会。
　 这个大会共开了两天。头一天，根据各小组会咯嚷的意见，处理玉宝，同时前两天县人民法庭已经判决了乾大脑，处分他三年徒刑，并开释回村执行，人也送回来了，征求村里的意见，因此会上也一道的讨论他的事。他和玉宝在会上坦白的错误倒比过去强得多，他二人上面下面说的也都碰，会上就决定同意县里对乾大脑的判决，并叫他往后好好听众大伙的话，努力生产。对玉宝，大家见他坦白得还老实，贪污款项他也承认尽他的力量吐出来，会上就决定只取消他作公民的权利，看他后日行动的好赖，再决定什么时候给他公民权，这个处理并请示区县批准；这么决定以后，拴成还对玉宝的事发表了一段意见，他说：“玉宝原也是跟咱们一样样的受苦人，只因他不走正道，光往邪道上学，就给地主汉奸收买了，当狗腿子使唤，反过来欺压咱受苦人；这么着，他就成了咱受苦人的仇人，对咱受苦人犯了大罪！可如今玉宝有了点认识了，坏脑筋也想往好里变了，也给咱坦白了，认了错，又五次三番声言：一定要跟咱们好好往正道上走：咱们欢迎他进步！人常说：“败子回头金不换！”往后只要玉宝真心实意干好事不干赖事，咱大伙也得帮助他拉把他，象拉把咱们的兄弟侄儿一样！大伙同意不同意？”这一段话，也有少数人不大同意，象大三就是；但多数人却点头称赞，吆喝“同意！”玉宝自己一直低着头直直地站着听，赶听完，抬起头来，人们见他眼也红了，还象要滚下眼泪一般，话不成声地说：“咱……大伙！咱往后要再不……不往好……好里改……改，咱就……就不不算人……大伙说怎么……怎么办就……就怎么办……”老尹最后也讲了一段话教育玉宝，会就散了。
    第二天，又开大会检讨了一阵工作，并决定了分果实、丈量地、准备分地等等，最后，全体通过浑村大伙和喜禄一道立时动手开大窑，办法先由选出的几个人合计个谱谱再讨论，反正大伙的劲头都鼓得挺足。此外，干部里边又多加了几个工农会的委员。会后村里就小会大会翻上倒下地比光景划等级，烘火热闹分浮财，直闹了五六天，象赶了五六天庙，家家关门闭户，男女老少齐出动，谁也说这是开天辟地头一遭大喜事，谁也是没日没夜地忙着；只有村里决定了叫立时动手计划拾掇大窑的几个人，没参加分果实的事。
    　　　　四十四　计划
    这里再说村里决定了大三天禄泰成和喜禄一道，由老白领着，计划拾掇大窑，他们在窑里窑外推敲了两天，估量出东窑约有存水十万担，老白便去阳泉矿上看了看，想借抽水机来打水；但跑遍各矿都借不到，老白急的不行，泰成却在这当口却不知怎么老是没劲没劲地老是说：“这没法闹！”天禄一个劲打劝人家：“甭着急，想法呗！”大三是两眼一瞪，胳膊一挥道：“这如今咱窑黑闹自己的窑，还没法？哼！不能安‘旋’打水？咱要干就不能半路拉稀，这可得说准定！”泰成忙道：“行！你想法吧，咱反正跟着干！”泰成象生了点气，以后他就不声不响地光跟着计划，问他什么他总是拉长声音道：“咱没意见！怎么也行！”别人因为正经心经意地想算一切，也就没管他，他还会两下算盘，只是让他帮着喜禄合算合算算了。
