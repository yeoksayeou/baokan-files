Beijing Water Company Reduces Water Prices

[Beijing News] In order to implement the resolution of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference and encourage citizens to use more clean tap water, the Beijing Water Company has reduced water prices starting in December. This is intended to improve environmental hygiene and promote the health of citizens. Except for industrial and commercial users, whose water prices will temporarily remain the same at a charge equivalent to 1.5 *jin* of millet per ton, the price for general households, government agencies, military units, and schools will be reduced to 1 *jin* of millet. To further encourage citizens to bathe and those without tap water facilities to drink tap water, the price for bathhouse water and retail water stations will be reduced to 0.75 *jin* of millet per ton. The monthly water price will be converted based on the millet price at the end of the previous month. This has been approved by the Municipal People's Government and will be implemented starting in December. However, the water price for December will be based on a millet price of 900 yuan per *jin* at the end of last month, but the company will temporarily use 800 yuan for conversion to reduce the burden on citizens. As a result, the water price for general users, excluding industrial and commercial users, has been reduced by one-third compared to the past, while the water price for bathhouse water and retail water has been reduced by one-half.
