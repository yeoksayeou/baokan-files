Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 15th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army has victoriously planted the solemn five-star national flag on Zhennanguan, the motherland's border in South China. The PLA, advancing westward from western Guangdong, entered Dongxing, a key coastal border city in western Guangdong, on the 9th. On the 10th, it liberated Mingjiang and Ningming in southwestern Guangxi. On the 11th, it annihilated the 33rd Division of the fleeing bandit 97th Army during pursuit. On the same day, it liberated Pingxiang and advanced into Zhennanguan, a key border defense location bordering Vietnam. When the commanders and fighters of the PLA ascended this majestic border pass, surrounded by mountains and possessing a natural strategic advantage, they all felt boundless excitement.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Hong Kong on the 13th: White bandit Chongxi has arrived in Hanoi, Vietnam. The mission of the White bandit in Hanoi is to discuss with the French authorities the retreat of the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit troops from the Guangdong-Guangxi border into Vietnam, in order to use Vietnam as a base, under the guise of the so-called "Vietnamese Volunteer Army" or other forms, to realize the conspiracy of preserving counter-revolutionary forces and waiting for an opportunity to counterattack.

    【新华社华南前线十五日电】中国人民解放军已胜利地将庄严的五星国旗插到华南的祖国边疆镇南关上。由粤西西进的解放军于九日进驻粤西沿海的边防要城东兴，十日解放桂西南的明江、宁明两城，十一日，在追击途中歼灭逃匪九十七军三十三师，同日，解放凭祥，并进驻与越南接壤的边防要地镇南关。当解放军的指战员们登上此一岗峦环抱、形势天成的边疆雄关时，无不感觉到无限的兴奋。
    【新华社北京十五日电】据美联社香港十三日电：白匪崇禧已抵达越南的河内。白匪到河内的任务是与法国当局商讨粤桂边境的国民党匪军残部退入越南，以便利用越南为根据地，在所谓“越南志愿军”或其他形势的掩护下，实现保存反革命力量，待机反攻的阴谋。
