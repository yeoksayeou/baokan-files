We are now jubilantly celebrating our liberation, but we have not forgotten that your talented and great theoretical guidance laid the foundation for the victory of the Chinese revolution. The Chinese people have already, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, defeated the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionaries, who were a concentrated manifestation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and achieved their own liberation, joining the equal and harmonious big family of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, enjoying for the first time the happiness of building our country freely according to our own will without imperialist interference. Dear Comrade Stalin, thanks to you and the existence of the Soviet Union, the people of the whole world have a bright and happy future. Please accept our heartfelt warmth and respect, congratulate you on your 70th birthday, and wish you eternal health!
