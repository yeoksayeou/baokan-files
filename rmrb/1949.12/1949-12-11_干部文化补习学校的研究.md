　　Research on Cadre Cultural Remedial Schools
　　The Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
　　(I) Overview
　　Since mid-September, the Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Government, and the Municipal Party Committee have established four cadre cultural remedial schools. They have been formally in session for two and a half months, with a total of 1,194 students. Excluding absences due to work, going to the countryside, and other reasons, about 1,000 students regularly attend classes.
　　Due to the extremely uneven age, rank, history, Party standing, and academic level of the cadres, it was decided that the cultural remedial schools must establish various different classes (currently, some are divided into junior high, higher primary, and lower primary classes; some have four lower primary classes, two higher primary classes, and one junior high class). At the same time, the characteristics of adults and cadres must be grasped, and the teaching content, teaching methods, and management methods should be different from those of general national schools. However, they also have common characteristics, which is that the students in the four schools have particularly high enthusiasm for learning culture, especially for learning Chinese language and arithmetic. As a result, the achievements in these two courses are relatively significant. This is because the cadres feel that their cultural level is insufficient due to the needs of their work and hope that the cultural remedial schools will make up for this deficiency.
　　The main achievement in the past two months is that we have systematically begun to help cadres improve their cultural level, and the leadership has also explored some preliminary experiences in running cultural schools. Some of these experiences are successful, and some are failures. From these successful and failed experiences, we have come to realize the following issues.
　　(II) Research on Several Specific Issues
　　(1) Stipulation of the School System: Cadre cultural remedial schools are spare-time cultural supplementary schools, but they are also relatively long-term formal schools. They require that the cultural level of all cadres participating in cultural remedial education be gradually and systematically raised to the junior high school level, so that they can participate in basic theoretical study in Group C in the future. In the past, the cultural remedial schools had no explicit regulations on learning goals and school systems, and the leadership had no clear requirements. The cadres participating in the study also had no clear goals to strive for. In order to achieve the above goals, we will tentatively set the school system at three and a half years, namely, one and a half years for lower primary school, one year for higher primary school, and one year for junior high school. From lower primary school to junior high school, we focus on the two subjects of Chinese language and arithmetic. The academic requirements for arithmetic should focus on practical application, so we only plan to learn up to simultaneous equations. The duration of this school system is four and a half years less than that of general national education, but because the curriculum of cultural remedial schools is concentrated and the students are adults, the main courses from primary school to junior high school can be completed in three and a half years.
　　(2) Class Arrangement: The current class arrangement is based on the Chinese language level after the examination, which is correct. However, some schools have too few classes, only three classes: junior high, higher primary, and lower primary. The levels within a class also vary greatly, which is not conducive to teaching. Therefore, in the future, more classes should generally be divided, with about 30 students in each class. It is convenient for teachers to take care of them, and they have similar levels. The multi-grade teaching method has proven to be ineffective, time-consuming, hindering progress, and involving each other. It is generally not suitable to adopt it. In addition, because the Chinese language level of general cadres has improved during their work, but their arithmetic level has declined, some people's Chinese language level is equivalent to junior high school, while their arithmetic level is only equivalent to higher primary school. In this case, it is best to take Chinese language in the junior high school class and arithmetic in the higher primary school class. This is to arrange classes by subject, so that the classes are more practical.
　　(3) Curriculum Content: Deciding what to teach must be in line with the requirements of the students' work. Many people participate in learning for the purpose of Chinese language and arithmetic. In the past, some of our schools arranged Chinese language, arithmetic, history, geography, politics, Russian, and natural science equally, which made the limited time insufficient for distribution, and the energy was scattered and could not be deepened. Therefore, the curriculum should be concentrated, focusing on Chinese language and arithmetic, supplemented by common sense, and adopting a weekly three-two-one system, that is, Chinese language three times, arithmetic twice, and common sense once, each time for two hours. With the foundation of Chinese language, there is self-study ability, and in the future, you can read history, geography, and other courses. The primary class is even more lacking in culture and needs to focus more on Chinese language and arithmetic, which can adopt a four-two system: that is, Chinese language four times and arithmetic twice. As for political learning, participate in the political learning of the agency.
　　Specific content of various courses: Chinese language should be based on the characteristics and requirements of adults and cadres, and requires textbooks that both improve culture and combine with improving politics. At present, the Chinese language textbooks for the higher and lower grades of general national schools are suitable for children, but not suitable for cadres. Therefore, the Chinese language readers for these two grades need to be re-edited, and only middle school Chinese language textbooks can be selected. The Chinese language textbooks for higher and lower grades are better with literacy textbooks. The junior high school textbooks are compiled and selected by the Editorial Committee, mainly to improve reading and writing skills, learn to make summaries, and focus on the selection of applied texts. Arithmetic uses existing arithmetic textbooks, but the explanation and exercises should use more facts from real life. Common sense is a comprehensive course, teaching relevant historical, geographical, and political common sense according to the development of the current situation.
　　(4) Teaching Methods: Adult and cadre education cannot completely use the teaching methods of national education. Because adults have strong comprehension and poor memory; because cadres "learn" and "use", they are required to be closely integrated. Therefore, teachers need to have rich social knowledge, not to be satisfied with teaching according to the book, but to be able to be familiar with the students' thoughts, and explain the students' difficulties. For example, the Chinese language class teaches "homophones" and "type characters", and the junior high school teaches "sentence structure" and "article writing", which are generally interesting to students and very popular with cadres. Some people propose that "the combination of school and agency" is correct, which is the same meaning as "the combination of school and family" in national education. Secondly, it is necessary to focus on object teaching, make some teaching aids under possible conditions, and in middle school, it is necessary to guide students to engage in more practice, such as practicing writing letters, writing simple work reports, and making simple statistics, which will appropriately exert students' comprehension and facilitate memory. Simple infusion-style education will inevitably emphasize rote memorization, which is not very suitable. Finally, the uneven level increases many difficulties in teaching. The progress of the course can only be based on the needs of the majority. For a few who can't keep up, or who are absent due to official business, we should emphasize tutoring outside of class, adopt the small teacher system, designate special personnel to help, and teachers use the gap to provide guidance, so that they can catch up with the general progress.
　　(5) Homework: To make students familiar with the course and learn to apply it, there must be homework. Only lectures in the classroom, without composition and arithmetic exercises, will have little effect. However, because the teachers are all part-time, it is impossible to spend a lot of energy revising homework. Therefore, the solution to this contradiction can be adopted in the following ways: A. Teachers mark and revise some homework. Point out the correct ones, praise the good ones, and criticize the incorrect ones, so that students have something to follow and automatically revise. The junior high school Chinese language class has now adopted the method of two lectures and one review per lesson, and the time for students and teachers to do homework and revise homework has been resolved. B. Small group collective revision. Divide the students into several groups, select the group leader with a higher level and active learning, and use the extra time, or the last half hour of each class (two hours), to discuss and revise homework in groups, "Everyone is a teacher, everyone is a student."
　　(6) Management System: Students are cadres and have self-consciousness, but there must also be certain systems and rules in order to ensure the normal progress of learning. It is wrong to deny various systems with the excuse of "we are not children." In the future, we must establish systems such as roll call, leave of absence, monthly exams, term exams (once every three months), annual graduation exams, and promotion and demotion systems. Important examinations must be reviewed for grades, posted publicly, and notified to the relevant agencies as one of the cadre appraisal materials.
　　(7) Meeting System: In order to exchange teaching experience and improve work, some meetings are needed, such as teaching symposiums, in which teachers and student representatives participate, reflecting opinions and improving teaching methods. The Education Committee should convene on time to solve some important problems in teaching in a timely manner. Establish class committees and group meetings among the students to assist the administration and ensure the implementation of school rules.
　　(III) Establishing a Correct Teaching Attitude
　　Among the teachers, some feel that they are teaching cadres, and some students are older, more experienced, and have higher positions than themselves. Therefore, they lack confidence and are overly humble, and as a result, the teaching effect is not great. Among the students, there are also those who flaunt their qualifications and do not abide by school rules, pick on teachers, ask strange questions, and are eager for success, wanting to "dig a well with one shovel" and other dishonest attitudes. Therefore, a correct teaching attitude must be established among teachers and students. On the teacher's side, we should promote a serious and serious attitude, and regard improving the culture of cadres as one of the revolutionary tasks. In teaching, we should give play to enthusiasm and creativity, and study various teaching experiences. Among the students, we should promote a down-to-earth learning attitude, earnestly learn culture, and prepare the foundation for future theoretical learning. At the same time, we should establish a style of respecting teachers and respecting teachers' guidance among the students.

　　干部文化补习学校的研究
    中共黑龙江省委宣传部
  　（一）概况
    九月中旬之后，省委省府、市委分别成立了四处干部文化补习学校，现已正式上课两个半月，计有学员一一九四人，除因工作、下乡等原因缺席外，经常上课的有一千人左右。
    由于干部的年龄、职别、历史、党龄、程度极不整齐，决定了文化补习学校就必须设各种不同的班次（现在有的分初中、高小、初小三班，有的初小分四班，高小两班，初中一班），同时又必须抓住成年人与干部的特点，而在教学内容、教学方法与管理方法上，应与一般国民学校有所不同。但他们也有着共同的特点，这就是四个学校的学员对学习文化，特别是对国文算术的学习，情绪特别高，因之这两门课程所收到的成绩也比较显著。这是由于工作的需要，干部感到文化不足，而希望由文化补习学校去补足这个缺憾。
    两个月的主要成绩，是系统的开始帮助干部提高文化，领导上也摸索了一些办文化学校的初步经验。这些经验有的是成功的，有的则是失败的，从这些成功与失败的经验中，使我们体会到下列问题。
    （二）几个具体问题的研究
    （１）学制的规定：干部文化补习学校，是一业余的文化补充学校，但它又是比较长期的正规学校，要求将所有参加文化补习的干部的文化水准逐步的有系统的提高到初中程度，将来能够参加丙组初浅理论学习。过去各文化补习学校对于学习目标与学制是无明文规定的，领导上也无明确的要求，参加学习的干部也无明确的奋斗目标。今后为达到上述目的，在学制上我们暂定为三年半，即初小一年半，高小一年，初中一年。初小至初中均着重于国文、算术两门，算术的修业要求，注意实际应用，因此只准备学到一次联立方程式。这个学制的年限比一般国民教育是少四年半的，但因为文化补习学校的课程集中，学员又是成年，故在三年半中，是可以完成由小学至初中的主要课程的。
    （２）编班问题：目前的分班是经过考试之后，基本上按照国文程度分班，这是对的，但有的学校分班太少，只有初中、高小、初小三班，一班之内也因程度悬殊，而不便于教学进行。因此，今后一般应多分班次，每班有三十人左右，教员即便于照顾，又有相近的程度，复式教学法，已证明效果不好，时间有限，防碍进度，且互相牵涉，一般不宜采用。此外，因一般干部在工作中国文程度是提高了，但算术程度却退步了，因之有的国文相当于初中，算术程度只相当于高小，在这种情况下，最好在初中班上国文，在高小班上算术，这是以学科编班，使班次更切合实际。
    （３）课程内容：决定教什么的问题，必须与学员在工作上的要求相适合，许多人参加学习的目的是为国文、算术而来，而我们过去有的学校将国文、算术、历史、地理、政治、俄文、自然等许多课程平均排列，则使有限时间不敷分配，精力分散不能深入，因之课程应该集中，应以国文、算术为主，辅之以常识，采取每周三二一制，即国文三次，算术两次，常识一次，每次两小时，有了国文的基础，即有了自修能力，将来即能阅读史地及其他各种课程。初级班由于更缺乏文化，更需要集中于国文、算术，可采取四二制：即国文四次，算术两次。至于政治学习，则参加机关政治学习。
    各种课程具体内容：国文应根据成年与干部的特点与要求，需要有既提高文化又与提高政治相结合的课本。目前一般国民学校的高初两级国文课本，适合于儿童，不适合于干部，因此，这两级的国文读本需要重编，中学国文课本只能选用。高初两级国文课本以识字课本为好，初中课本由编选委员会讨论编选，主要是提高阅读与写作能力，学会作总结，着重于应用文字的选择。算术即采用现有算术课本，惟讲解与习题，应多用现实生活中的事实。常识为一综合课程，按时局发展，讲授有关的史地与政治常识。
    （４）教学方法：成年与干部教育，不能完全使用国民教育的教学法。由于成年的理解力强而记忆力差；由于是干部“学”与“用”就要求密切结合。因之，教员就需要有丰富的社会知识，不能满足于照本教课，而要能够熟悉学员思想，针对学员疑难，加以解释，如国文课教“同音字”“类型字”，初中教“句的构造”“文章作法”，一般学生感到趣味，大受干部欢迎。有人提出“学校与机关结合”是正确的，这与国民教育当中的“学校与家庭相结合”是同一意义的。其次是要着重于实物教学，在可能条件下作些教具，在中学则需引导学员多从事实习，如练习写信，写简单工作报告，作简单统计等，这会适当的发挥学员理解力便于记忆，单纯的注入式教育必然要强调死记，是不大合适的。最后，程度不齐增加了教学上很多困难，课程进度只能是按照大多数的需要，对少数赶不上，或因公缺课者，应强调课外补习，采取小先生制，指定专人帮助，教员利用空隙给予指导，使之能赶上一般进度。
    （５）课外作业：要使学员熟悉课程，并学会应用，就必须有课外作业。只有课堂讲授，没有作文、算术习题，其收效是小的。但又由于教员全系兼职，不可能以很多精力修改作业，因此，这一矛盾的解决可采取如下方式：甲、教员榜改与抽改。指出正确的，表扬好的，批判不正确的，使学员有所遵循，自动修改。初中国文课现已采取每课两次讲授一次复习的办法，学员与教员的作业与修改作业时间，已获得解决。乙、小组集体修改，将学员划分若干小组，选出程度较高而又学习积极的作组长，利用课外、或每天上课（两小时）的最后半点钟，分组讨论修改作业，“大家当先生、大家当学生”。
    （６）管理制度：学员是干部，有自觉性，然也必须有一定的制度、规则，而后始能保证学习正常的进行，借口“我们又不是小孩子”，而否认各种制度是错误的。今后必须建立点名、请假、月考、期考（每三月一次）、年考毕业考试及升级降级等制度，重要考试，须审核成绩，张榜公布，通知各该机关，作为干部鉴定材料之一。
    （７）会议制度：为交流教学经验、改进工作，有些会议是需要的，如教学座谈会，由教员与学员代表参加，反映意见，改进教学方法。教育委员会应按时召开，及时解决教学上的一些重要问题，学员中建立班务会、小组会，协助行政，保证校规的执行。
    （三）树立正确的教学态度
    在教员中，有的感到是教干部的，有些学员比自己年龄大，经验多，地位高，因之缺乏信心，过分谦虚，其结果教学效果不大。在学员中，也有摆资格不守校规，向教员挑皮，提怪问题，急于求成，想“一锹挖个井”等等不老实态度。因此必须在教员与学生中建立正确的教学态度，在教员方面，应提倡认真严肃的态度，把提高干部文化，做为革命工作之一。在教学中应发挥积极性与创造性，研究各种教学经验。在学员中应提倡老老实实的学习态度，认真学习文化，为将来学习理论准备基础。同时应在学员中，树立尊重教员的作风，尊重教员的指导。
