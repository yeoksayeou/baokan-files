Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th: British workers have launched a struggle to resist the Labor government's attack on the living standards of the working people. According to Agence France-Presse and United Press reports: Electricity workers at three state-owned power stations in London went on strike on the 12th, demanding the restoration of special wages paid for working in harsh conditions, which had been discontinued since June. At the beginning of the strike, the British government dispatched troops to the factories to suppress the strike, causing anger among the workers. On the 13th, workers at London's largest state-owned power station in Barking also joined the strike, bringing the number of strikers to 2,800. The strike lasted until the 15th, when the workers agreed to resume work on the condition that the troops were withdrawn and that no strikers would be prosecuted for disrupting public services, while negotiations were conducted. However, after the workers at the Barking power plant resumed work, the authorities issued a notice stating that workers must resume work unconditionally. Workers at the three major power stations unanimously continued their strike, and workers at the Barking power plant warned the authorities that they would strike again if the conditions were not met. Meanwhile, electricity workers in Leeds and Liverpool sent telegrams to the striking workers in London expressing their support.

A British Information Service message stated that the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, representing 37 unions with 2.8 million members, notified the Engineering and Allied Employers' National Federation earlier this month, demanding a general wage increase of one pound per week for male workers in the engineering industry. The Confederation of Unions believes that this demand should be met from the employers' current profits and should not require an increase in the price of manufactured goods.

According to TASS: Representatives of 23,000 miners in East Wales and the miners' branch in Rhondda have resolved to demand higher wages. The Welsh miners expressed extreme indignation at the massacre of miners by the British colonial government in Nigeria, West Africa, and demanded that the British miners investigate this bloody case. The executive committee of the South Wales Miners' Federation and the miners' branches in Fforestfach, Rhondda, and other places, unanimously voted to ban the shooting of miners in Nigeria.

　　英工人展开罢工斗争
  　抗击工党政府进攻生活水平
    【新华社北京十七日电】英国工人已展开斗争，反抗工党政府对劳动人民生活水平的进攻。据法新社、合众社讯：伦敦三国有电力站的电力工人十二日举行罢工，要求恢复因在恶劣情况下进行工作而支付的特别工资，此项工资从六月间已经停止发给。英国政府于罢工开始时，即派遣军队进驻工厂镇压，引起工人愤怒。十三日位于巴尔金的伦敦最大国有电力站工人亦参加罢工，罢工人数达二千八百人，罢工持续至十五日，工人同意在撤出军队及不得以破坏公共事业的罪名对罢工工人起诉的条件下，一面复工，一面进行谈判。但当局在巴尔金电厂工人复工后，又发布工人必须无条件复工的公告，三大电力站工人一致继续罢工，巴尔金电厂工人则警告当局，如不履行条件，将再度罢工。同时，里子和利物浦的电力工人致电伦敦罢工工人表示声援。
    英国新闻处消息称：代表三十七个工会、拥有二百八十万会员的造船和机器工会联合会，本月初通知全国机器各业雇主联合会，要求机器工业男工每周普遍增加工资一磅。工会联合会认为此项要求应从雇主的现行利润中开支，无须增加制造品的价格。
    另据塔斯社讯：东威尔斯二万三千矿工代表和鲁达城矿工分会已议决要求增加工资。威尔斯矿工对于西部非洲尼日利亚英殖民地政府屠杀矿工工人一事极表愤慨，要求委托英国矿工调查此一血案。南威尔斯矿工联合会执行委员会及芬山、鲁达和其他地方的矿工分会，一致表决禁止在尼日利亚向矿工开枪射击。
