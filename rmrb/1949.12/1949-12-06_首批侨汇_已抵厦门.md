  　Has Arrived in Xiamen
    [News from this newspaper] Following the liberation of Xiamen, the first batch of overseas remittances is reported to have arrived in the city. To safeguard the interests of the dependents of overseas Chinese, the Bank of China in Xiamen has specifically sent letters to various Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureaus, stating that when overseas remittances are received, they should adhere to regulations and hand over the remittances to the Bank of China. When disbursing the funds, the Bank of China will convert them into Renminbi at the exchange rate of the day, or handle them using the original currency deposit method.
