　　Stalin is the Creator of the Peace Front
    By Alexander Baradin, President of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian Republic, translated by Yin Xi

    On November 6, 1942—while military operations against Hitler's Germany, which had perfidiously attacked the Soviet Union, were raging fiercely—as the Nazi armies approached Stalingrad and the outskirts of the North Caucasus, the great leader of the Soviet people, the head of the Soviet government—N. B. Stalin—defined the lofty purpose of the anti-fascist war of liberation in this way: “The abolition of racial exclusiveness; equality of nations and the inviolability of their territories; the liberation of enslaved nations and the restoration of their sovereign rights; the right of every nation to live according to its own wishes; economic assistance to oppressed nations and practical assistance to them in achieving material well-being; the restoration of liberty.” These words were spoken at a time when the Soviet people were not only defending their homeland but also defending world civilization from Nazi barbarous enslavement, engaging in large-scale battles against the powerful Hitler military machine one after another, and enduring unprecedented sacrifices for the sake of victory.

    These few concise words defined a great program of post-war peace construction, the realization of which should and could guarantee those suffering people a solid and lasting, truly democratic peace.

    From the day of victory until now, the Soviet Union has steadfastly followed this Stalinist program, tirelessly calling on governments and peoples of all countries to cooperate and coordinate on all post-war issues in a spirit of justice and mutual respect for the sovereignty and rights of all nations, so that large and small countries alike may benefit.

    The leaders of Soviet foreign policy have never forgotten that the great Stalin signed the Yalta Declaration, which stated: "Only through the continued and developed cooperation and mutual understanding between our three countries and all peace-loving peoples can the highest aspiration of mankind—a firm and lasting peace—be realized." Everyone knows how the heads of government of the other two countries at the time—participants in the Crimean Conference—treated the signing of this declaration. The declaration of the "American Century," atomic diplomacy, the Cold War, the arms race, aggressive pacts—this is what they countered Stalin's peace policy with, this is what they understood by "cooperation and mutual understanding," this is how they realized "the highest aspiration of mankind." The result clearly defines the two lines of world politics:

    One is the line of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is a bulwark for resisting the reactionary forces of imperialism and striving for peace and democracy among nations. The other is the line of the imperialist, anti-democratic camp headed by the United States, whose aim is to enslave other countries and peoples, forcibly establish the world rule of American monopoly capitalists, undermine democratic forces, and launch new wars. The creator and defender of the peace policy—the head of the Soviet state, the leader of the Soviet people—Stalin, has consistently and resolutely implemented this policy. Marshal Stalin, in answering a question from Allied Press correspondent Aiji Kimmer, said: "I deeply believe that no nation, no matter what its army, wants another new war. They want peace and are willing to work to guarantee peace. In order to maintain peace and tranquility throughout the world, it is necessary to expose the instigators of new wars in a timely manner and not allow them to use their power against the interests of peace." Stalin has called on and is calling on all democratic and progressive forces in the world to expose the instigators of new wars and their criminal plans.

    Stalin inspires the peace policy and organizes the world's peace front. The policy of the imperialist camp, which is to launch new wars and obey the interests of a small group of monopoly capitalists—the financial capitalist tycoons of the United States and Britain—is fundamentally hostile to the hopes of ordinary people who yearn for lasting and just peace. Now, the movement of the people against the adventurous policies of the instigators of new wars is expanding everywhere, committees for the defense of peace have been established everywhere, and peace conferences have been held in many countries, where progressive people are loudly denouncing the instigators of new wars. These fighters for peace, no matter where they meet—in Paris or Beijing, in Milan or New York, in London or Calcutta, no matter what nation they belong to, no matter what color their skin is, all shout in unison the name of the great friend of all peoples, the creator and defender of the peace camp—Stalin.

    They have not forgotten Stalin's words:

    "Not long ago the horrors of war were still so clearly remembered in the minds of the people, and the social forces fighting for peace are so vast, that Churchill's aggressive apprentices cannot overcome these forces and drag them into a new war."

    These words are full of profound wisdom, these words inspire and organize hundreds of millions of people to rise up against the instigators of new wars and fight for peace. This peace front is led by the victorious socialist country—the Soviet Union—led by Stalin.

    We—the Soviet people—are proud that our Soviet state has been and always will be a strong pillar of international security and just peace. The Soviet people are proud that all sincere supporters of peace in every remote corner of the earth hopefully regard Stalin and the Soviet Union as the most resolute and powerful defenders of the cause of peace.

    We are proud that in all corners of the world, in all countries, they shout with great love—the name of Stalin, the first soldier, commander, great organizer and inspirer of peace forces, great creator of peace, in the struggle for peace.

    Stalin's name has become the banner of hundreds of millions of ordinary people fighting for peace and democracy. Stalin has ignited the confidence of ordinary people on earth in striving for world peace, national independence, and friendship and goodwill between all countries and nations.

    Under the leadership of the great Stalin, the forces fighting for peace and against war will force the instigators of war to retreat and abandon their criminal attempts.

### 斯大林是和平阵线的创造者

　　斯大林是和平阵线的创造者
    乌克兰共和国科学院主席  亚历山大·巴拉丁作  印希译
    在一九四二年十一月六日——抗击背信弃义地进攻苏联的希特勒德国的军事行动正激烈进行的当儿，——其时纳粹大军迫近斯大林格勒和北高加索郊区，苏维埃人民的伟大领袖，苏维埃政府的首脑——Ｎ·Ｂ·斯大林——曾这样的确定了反对法西斯解放战争的崇高目的：“消灭种族例外性；各民族平等以及他们领土的不可侵犯；解放各被奴役民族及恢复其主权；每一个民族有按照自己愿望自行生活；给被压迫的民族以经济帮助，并在实际上协助他们获得物质幸福；恢复自由。”这些话发表的时机，是正当苏维埃人民不但保卫自己祖国，而且保卫全世界文明以免除纳粹野蛮奴役，对强大的希特勒军事机构进行一次又一次的大规模斗争，并且为了胜利而忍受空前牺牲的时候。
    这几句简洁的话确定了战后和平建设的伟大纲领，这个纲领的实现应当而且能够给那些受苦难的人民保证巩固和持久的、真正民主的和平。
    苏联从胜利的一天起直到现在，坚定不移地依照这个斯大林纲领，不倦地号召各国政府和人民以正义和互相尊重各民族主权与权利的精神，在战后一切问题上实行合作与协调，使大小各国均蒙其利。
    苏联对外政策的领导者们，一时一刻也未曾忘记，伟大的斯大林曾在雅尔达宣言中签了字，那儿曾说：“惟有我们三个国家之间及一切爱好和平的人民之间继续和发展共同合作与互相了解，人类之最高愿望——坚固而永久的和平，才能实现。”大家都知道，当时其他两个国家政府之首领——克里米亚会议的参加者，是如何对待这个宣言上的签字的。“美国世纪”的宣布，原子外交，冷战，军备竞争，侵略公约——这就是他们对抗斯大林和平政策的东西，这就是他们所了解的“合作与互相了解，”这就是他们实现“人类最高愿望”的方法。其结果很显著地确定了世界政策的两条路线：
    一个是以苏联为首的民主的反帝国主义阵营的路线，苏联是为反对帝国主义的反动势力而进行顽强彻底斗争的，并为争取各民族间的和平争取民主的堡垒。另一个是以美国为首的帝国主义的、反民主阵营的路线，其目的是奴役其他国家和人民，强制建立美国垄断资本家的世界统治，破坏民主力量和发动新的战争。和平政策的创造者和保卫者——苏维埃国家的首脑，苏维埃人民的领袖——斯大林，一贯地并坚决地实现这一政策。斯大林大元师在回答合从社记者艾吉·基莫尔的问题时，曾说：“我深深相信，无论那个民族，无论他们的军队，都不愿意再有新的战争。他们希望和平，并愿为保障和平而努力，为了保持和平和全世界的安宁，必须及时地揭露新战争的煽动者，不让他们有可能妄用自己的力量去反对和平的利益。”斯大林曾号召并正在号召世界上一切民主进步的力量来揭露新战争的煽动者及其罪恶的计划。
    斯大林鼓舞和平政策并组织全世界的和平阵线。帝国主义阵营的政策，是在发动新的战争，服从一小群独占资本家——美国和英国金融资本大亨们的利益，这种政策根本敌视一般渴望永久正义和平的老百姓之希望的。现在，人民反对新战争煽动者冒险政策的运动，到处在扩大着，到处成立了保卫和平委员会，在许多国家里举行了保卫和平大会，在这些大会上，进步人士都大声疾呼反对新战争的煽动者。这些为争取和平而斗争的战士，不论在什么地方——在巴黎或是在北京，在米兰或是在纽约，在伦敦或是在加尔各答开会的，无论他们属于那一个民族，无论他们是那一种肤色，到处都异口同声地喊着各族人民的伟大朋友，和平阵营的创造者与保卫者——斯大林的名字。
    他们没有忘记斯大林的话：
    “不久以前战争的恐怖在人民的记忆中，还记得如此清楚，而为和平奋斗的社会力量是如此庞大，以致邱吉尔的侵略学徒们不能克服这些力量把它们拉到新的战争方面去。”
    这些话充满了深厚的智慧，这些话鼓舞起并组织了亿万的人们起来反对新战争的煽动者，争取和平。这个和平阵线是以斯大林所领导的胜利的社会主义国家——苏联为首的。
    我们——苏维埃人民所引为骄傲的，是我们苏维埃国家过去和现在永远是国际安全和正义和平的强大柱石。苏维埃人民所引为骄傲的，是地球上每一个辽远角落里的一切真诚的拥护和平的人，都带着希望把斯大林和苏联视为和平事业中最坚决最有力的保卫者。
    我们所引为骄傲的，是在世界上所有的角落里，所有的国家内，以伟大的热爱喊着——争取和平的第一名战士、司令员、伟大的和平力量底组织者和鼓舞者，伟大的和平创造者——斯大林底名字。
    斯大林的名字已成为亿万老百姓争取和平、争取民主的旗帜。斯大林燃起了地球上一般老百姓争取世界和平，争取各民族独立，争取各国家各民族之间友谊与善良意志的信心。
    在伟大的斯大林底领导下，争取和平，反对战争的力量将迫使战争煽动者退却，放弃他们的罪恶企图。
