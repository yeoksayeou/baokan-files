Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: The following is a summary of the speech by Park Chung-hee, Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Women's League, at the second day of the Asian Women's Representative Conference:

　　Dear representatives, the Korean people and women have suffered cruel exploitation and oppression under thousands of years of feudal rule and the 90-year-long aggressive policy of Japanese imperialism.

　　The great Soviet army liberated Korea from the iron heel of Japanese imperialism, guaranteeing the Korean people the right to decide the destiny of their own motherland according to their own will, and guaranteeing the freedom and happiness of Korean women in the future.

　　On March 5, 1946, North Korea implemented land reform, permanently eliminating feudal land ownership; on June 24 of the same year, advanced labor laws were implemented; on August 10 of the same year, the law on the nationalization of industries was implemented, overthrowing the economic foundation of past national traitors. On July 30, the historically significant law on equal rights for men and women was implemented, freeing women from thousands of years of feudal bondage and imperialist oppression, and giving women the right to participate in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life.

　　Based on the victory of democracy, the North Korean people have laid the material foundation for a completely independent and autonomous country. We have not only successfully completed the People's Economic Plans for 1947 and 1948, but also the new Two-Year Economic Plan for 1949-1950 is being carried out victoriously.

　　These democratic reforms and construction have brought about epoch-making changes in the political, economic, cultural, and various social lives of our women. The only women's organization in North Korea, the North Korean Women's General League, established on November 18, 1945, now has 1.48 million members and has become a powerful link in the Korean Fatherland Unification Democratic Front.

　　North Korean women actively participated in the election of local political power organs on November 3, 1946, and the election of the Supreme People's Assembly on August 25, 1948. Thirty-three women were elected as members of the Supreme People's Assembly, and thousands of women members of people's committees at all levels and female staff members of government agencies.

　　North Korean women have demonstrated a high degree of creativity and have participated in economic work in factories, mines, enterprises, and other fields to revive and develop the national economy. For example, Comrade Jin Xiuzi of the Nanpu Textile Factory exceeded her personal production volume for 1948 by 543%, created a new weaving method, and trained more than 30 skilled workers.

　　Because North Korean working women, together with all workers, actively participate in the patriotic production increase struggle, North Korea's industrial production increased by 189.3% in 1947 compared to 1946. It increased by 263.3% in 1948, and will increase to 377.1% in 1949, rapidly eliminating the colonial deformity and backwardness in the Korean economic system.

　　Female staff members and workers in North Korea have ample opportunities for rest. In 1948 alone, 4,510 women received rest treatment in 20 sanatoriums, and 4,622 enjoyed 72 days of maternity leave (with full pay during leave) and subsidies. In factories, enterprises, and agencies where women are concentrated, nurseries, breast-feeding rooms, children's parks, and other facilities with adequate sanitation have been established. According to statistics, there are 51 permanent nurseries, accommodating more than 53,600 children.

　　After the rural women of North Korea were allocated land, they are carrying out activities such as accumulating fertilizer, increasing livestock production, and all the necessary fiber raw materials for light industry with high enthusiasm. Currently, there are more than 6,100 rural women who are members of the farmers' league committees at all levels, leading the development of the rural economy.

　　North Korea also guarantees women's right to education in terms of culture and education. In the past, there were no female university students in North Korea, but now there are more than 1,200, as well as 180 female teachers, including 61 female professors at universities and specialized schools. More than 3,700 female medical workers and health personnel are fighting for the development of people's health.

　　In 1948, 338 women were recognized by the state. In 1949, 23 women received medals from the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly.

　　However, South Korea is the opposite of North Korea, still a dark world of exploitation, enslavement, hunger, poverty, and bankruptcy.

　　American imperialism suppresses all democratic movements, dissolves the People's Committees established by the will of the people, and suppresses various democratic political parties. On the other hand, it protects and supports the reactionary forces of pro-Japanese national traitors, acting as its running dogs.

　　There is no democratic right to be seen in South Korea now. Patriotic people are being reported and imprisoned, and innocent people and children have become targets of abuse. South Korean women do not have even the most basic democratic rights. The South Korean Women's League has been persecuted.

　　These facts make us realize that wherever American imperialism extends its aggressive claws, the people will have no national independence and freedom, nor will there be a happy life for women and children. Therefore, it is no accident that the patriotic Korean people are carrying out armed guerrilla warfare against the American aggressive policy and to overthrow the Syngman Rhee puppet government, which has spread to various regions of South Korea.

　　Dear representatives, the political situation in my country clearly tells us that the great Soviet Union's foreign policy is to liberate small and weak nations and help them achieve independence and democracy. On the contrary, American imperialists are implementing aggressive policies to complete their expansion plans.

　　American imperialists not only hinder the unification, independence, and democratic development of my country, but also infringe upon the national independence and freedom of all Asian people, trampling on the freedom and rights and future happiness of women. Therefore, it is our common enemy.

　　If the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism are not thoroughly shattered, the independence of all oppressed nations in Asia's colonies and semi-colonies and the rights and happiness of women and infants will not be guaranteed. Asian women have a common task: to thoroughly shatter the barbaric aggressive policies of American imperialism and the conspiracy to provoke a new war.

　　In the struggle to defeat the enemy of the independence and liberation of the Asian people – American imperialism – Asian women should unite more closely, exchange experiences with each other, and strengthen mutual support.

　　We must shatter the conspiracy of American imperialism to organize the Pacific Alliance, oppose the arming of Japan, and support the democratic movement of the Japanese people and Japanese women. We must thoroughly defeat the national traitors of various countries manipulated by American imperialism and completely drive out all aggressive forces of American imperialism in Asia.

　　This great struggle is extremely arduous. But as long as we unite, we will have a strong force. No force can conquer our united strength, and the liberation struggle of Asian women will surely achieve final victory.

　　The heroic Chinese people, under the leadership of their great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, have achieved a great victory and established the People's Republic of China. This historically significant event has pointed out the direction of victory for the national liberation struggle of the Asian people.

　　Asian women must unite closely with all the people of Asia and the great Soviet people and women, and strengthen the unity of democratic women and peace-loving people all over the world.

　　朝鲜代表朴正爱发言摘要
    【新华社北京十二日电】北朝鲜民主妇女同盟委员长朴正爱在亚洲妇女代表会议第二日会议上的发言摘要如下：
    亲爱的各位代表们，我们朝鲜人民和妇女在数千年的封建统治及九十年来的日本帝国主义侵略政策之下，受尽了残酷的剥削和压迫。
    伟大的苏联军队从日本帝国主义的铁蹄下解放了朝鲜，保障了朝鲜人民以自己的意志来决定他们自己祖国的命运，保障了朝鲜妇女的自由和幸福的将来。
    一九四六年三月五日，北朝鲜实行了土地改革，永远肃清了封建的土地所有关系；同年六月二十四日，实施了先进的劳动法令；在同年八月十日，实施了产业国有化的法令，推翻了过去民族叛徒的经济基础。七月三十日，又实施了有历史意义的男女平等权法令，使妇女摆脱了数千年来的封建束缚和帝国主义压迫，使妇女有了参加政治、经济和文化等各方面生活的权利。
    在民主胜利的基础上，北朝鲜人民已经奠定完全独立自主国家的物质基础。我们不但胜利地完成了一九四七年和一九四八年度的人民经济计划，同时一九四九——一九五○年的新二年经济计划，也正在胜利地进行着。
    这种民主改革和建设，使得我们妇女在政治、经济、文化的各种社会生活中，有了划时代的改变。一九四五年十一月十八日成立的北朝鲜唯一的妇女团体——北朝鲜妇女总同盟，现在拥有一百四十八万盟员，成为朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中有力的一环。
    北朝鲜妇女们积极参加一九四六年十一月三日地方政权机关的选举和一九四八年八月二十五日全国最高人民会议的选举。三十三名妇女被选为最高人民会议议员，各级人民委员会女议员及机关女工作人员，共达数千名。
    北朝鲜的妇女发挥了高度的创造性，为了复兴与发展民族经济，参加工厂、矿工、企业等各方面的经济工作。举例来说，南埔纺织工厂的金秀子同志，以百分之五四三超过了一九四八年度的个人生产量，创造新的纺织法，培养了三十余名熟练工人。
    由于北朝鲜的劳动妇女和全体工人一起，积极参加着爱国的增产斗争，因而北朝鲜的工业生产一九四七年比一九四六年增加了百分之一八九．三。一九四八年增加了百分之二六三．三，一九四九年将增加到百分之三七七．一，迅速地肃清了朝鲜经济体系中的殖民地畸形和落后性。
    北朝鲜的女职员、女工有充分的休息机会。仅在一九四八年，就有四五一○名妇女在二十所休养所里，受到休息的待遇，四六二二名享受到产前产后七十二天的休假（休假期间工资照发）和补助金。在妇女集中劳动的工厂、企业及机关里，设立了有充分卫生设施的托儿所、接乳室、儿童公园等。据统计，有五十一所常设托儿所，共容有五万三千六百余名儿童。
    北朝鲜的农村妇女分得了土地后，以高度的热情进行着积肥，增产家畜，和轻工业中所需的一切纤维原料等。现在有六千一百余名农村妇女为农民同盟各级委员会的委员，领导着农村经济的发展。
    北朝鲜在文化教育方面，也保障了妇女入学的权利。北朝鲜过去没有女大学生，现在则有一二○○余名，还有一八○名女教员，其中包括六十一名大学及专门学校的女教授。三千七百余名女医务工作者与保健人员，正为发展人民的保健事业而斗争着。
    一九四八年，有三三八名妇女受到国家的表彰。一九四九年，有二三名妇女得到最高人民会议常任委员会的奖章。
    但是南朝鲜却和北朝鲜相反，依然是剥削、奴役、饥饿、贫困和破产没落的黑暗世界。
    美帝国主义镇压一切民主运动，解散了由人民意志树立的人民委员会，镇压各民主政派。另一方面，则保护与扶植亲日派民族叛徒的反动势力，充当它的走狗。
    现在南朝鲜根本看不到民主的权利。爱国的人民都遭到检举、监禁，无辜的人民和儿童也成了虐杀的对象。南朝鲜妇女根本没有初步的民主权利。南朝鲜妇女同盟则遭到迫害。
    这些事实使我们识清了无论在任何地方，只要在有美帝国主义伸出侵略魔手的地方，人民就不会有民族独立和自由，同时也不会有妇女儿童的幸福生活。所以爱国的朝鲜人民，反对美国的侵略政策，为打倒李承晚傀儡政府而进行的武装游击斗争，蔓延到南朝鲜各地区，这绝不是偶然的事情。
    亲爱的各位代表们，我祖国的政治形势清楚地告诉我们，伟大的苏联的对外政策是为了解放弱小民族帮助其独立和民主的。相反地，美帝国主义者却为了完成自己的扩张计划，实行侵略的政策。
    美帝国主义者不仅妨碍我祖国的统一、独立和民主发展，而且也侵害全亚洲人民的民族独立和自由，蹂躏妇女的自由和权利及未来的幸福。所以它是我们共同的敌人。
    如果不彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，全亚洲殖民地、半殖民地被压迫民族的独立及妇婴的权利与幸福，是不会有保障的。亚洲妇女有一个共同的任务：彻底粉碎美帝国主义野蛮的侵略政策与挑拨新战争的阴谋。
    在打倒亚洲人民独立解放的仇敌——美帝国主义者的斗争中，亚洲妇女应当更紧密地团结起来，互相交流经验，加强彼此间的声援。
    我们要粉碎美帝国主义组织太平洋同盟的阴谋，反对武装日本，要支持日本人民和日本妇女的民主运动。我们要彻底打倒美帝国主义操纵下的各国民族叛徒，彻底赶走美帝国主义在亚洲的一切侵略势力。
    这一伟大的斗争是万分艰苦的。但是只要我们团结起来，我们就有强大的力量。任何力量也不能征服我们团结的力量，亚洲妇女的解放斗争一定会取得最后的胜利。
    英勇的中国人民在其伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，取得了伟大的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国，这一有历史意义的事变，给亚洲人民的民族解放斗争，指出了胜利的方向。
    亚洲妇女要和全亚洲的人民以及伟大的苏联人民与妇女紧密团结起来，加强全世界民主妇女和爱好和平人民的团结。
