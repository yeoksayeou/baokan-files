　　Supporting the Handling of Year-End Double Salary Bonus Method
　　Shanghai Workers Wang Yongnian and Others Submit Letters to *Liberation Daily*
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Shanghai public factory workers Wang Yongnian and others recently sent a letter to the Shanghai *Liberation Daily*, supporting the Central People's Government's handling of the year-end double salary method. The original letter roughly stated:
    Editor,
    We are workers in a public factory. After seeing the "Circular of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Administrative Council of the Central People's Government on the Handling of the Original Year-End Double Salary or Bonus Issue in Public Enterprises" published in your newspaper on the 14th, we brought it up for discussion in our study group because it concerns our interests. Everyone expressed their opinions and frankly revealed their thoughts at the time. In the past, our year-end bonus income originally exceeded the sum of two months' salary and wages. Some workers with heavier living burdens had some complaints about this regulation. Other workers with higher political awareness believed that we workers should endure temporary difficulties to strive for future happiness. Most touching was an old worker in his sixties with very difficult economic circumstances. He said: In terms of my personal situation, the year-end bonus income is a sum of subsidy to repay debts to relatives and friends. Although it has increased the difficulties for myself and some others with the same needs, I deeply understand that at a time when the country has not yet been completely liberated, everyone has a responsibility to support the front. In order to strive for final victory, completely eliminate the reactionaries, and enable the smooth advancement of new democratic construction, my personal difficulties are truly insignificant! Moreover, today the state power is led by our working class, and the country's financial difficulties are also the difficulties of our working class! After such a heated and sincere discussion, some workers who were slightly uneasy in their hearts were also relieved, and everyone improved a step in their thinking.

    We hope that friends in all public factories will study the reasons why the State Administrative Council's Financial and Economic Committee pointed out that the People's Government was compelled to make this decision. We believe that the working class has a high degree of political awareness and will be able to deeply understand the country's difficulties and support this decision without complaint.
　　Wang Yongnian, Zhang Guifen
    Worker Zhou Guang also wrote a letter saying:
    Editor,
    I was deeply moved after reading the news "State Administrative Council Finance Committee Notice on Year-End Double Salary Method for Public Enterprises" published in the *Liberation Daily* on the 14th! At a stage when the People's Government still has financial difficulties, it still takes care of our workers' year-end double salary tradition. We workers have never encountered such warmth. In my opinion, in addition to supporting it, we workers should further explain it in detail to employees with relatively backward thinking so that everyone can understand. I also hope that our working class can give play to the revolutionary spirit, voluntarily take less within the possible range, or purchase public bonds at a discount, to consolidate our gained victory.

　　拥护处理年终双薪奖金办法
　  上海工人王永年等投书解放日报
    【本报讯】上海市公营工厂工人王永年等，顷致函上海解放日报，拥护中央人民政府处理年终双薪办法。原函略称：编者先生：
    我们是公营工厂的工人，看到贵报十四日所刊的中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会关于公营企业原有年终双薪或奖金问题处理办法的通告，我们曾在学习小组会上提出来漫谈，因为这是有关我们的利益的，当时每个人都发表了意见，坦白地暴露了自己的思想。在过去，我们年终奖金的收入，原是超过两个月的薪津以及工的总和的。有几位生活负担比较重的工友，对于这个规定，多少有点牢骚；其他政治觉悟较高的工友，认为我们工人应该忍受暂时的困难，来争取将来的幸福；最令人感动的，是一位六十多岁经济十分艰困的老工人，他说：论个人的境况，年终奖金的收入，是一笔的补助，来偿还亲友们的欠帐。现在虽然增加了我个人以及和我有同样需要的一部分人的困难，但我却深切子了解，在目前全国尚未完全解放的时候，人人都有支前的责任，为了争取最后胜利，彻底消灭反动派，使新民主主义的建设可以顺利推进，那我个人的困难真是微不足道！何况今天国家的政权，是我们工人阶级所领导的，国家财政的困难，也就是我们工人阶级的困难呀！经过这样热烈诚恳的讨论，有几位心上稍有不然的工友，也释然了，大家在思想上都提高了一步。
    我们希望各公营工厂的朋友们，大家都来学习政务院财经委员会所指出的人民政府迫不得已作此决定的原因，我们相信，工人阶级具有高度的政治觉悟，必然能够深切体谅国家的困难，毫无怨言地拥护这一决定。
  　王永年、张桂芬同启
    工人周光了也写信说：编者先生：
    十四日解放日报登载的“政务院财委会通告公营企业年终双薪办法”的消息，我读了以后，深觉感动！人民政府在财政尚存在着困难的阶段，还来照顾到我们工人的年终双薪的惯例，这样的温情，我们工人是从来没有遇到过的。我的意见，我们工人除了应该拥护以外，还应该进一步向思想比较落后的职工们详加解释，使大家都能明白。我更希望我们工人阶级能够发挥革命精神，在可能范围内自愿少拿，或购买折寮公债，来巩固我们已得的胜利。
