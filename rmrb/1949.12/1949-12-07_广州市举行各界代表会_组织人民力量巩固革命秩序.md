Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 5th: The Guangzhou Municipal People's Representatives Conference was successfully held from November 27th to December 1st. A total of 368 representatives attended the meeting. Ye Jianying, the Mayor of Guangzhou, explained in his opening speech that convening the People's Representatives Conference is a concrete step in implementing the people's democratic dictatorship. The representatives attending this conference are representatives of workers, farmers, the petty bourgeoisie, and the liberal bourgeoisie. This conference allows these people's representatives to democratically discuss issues to realize the people's democracy. At the same time, because the reactionaries are still carrying out various sabotage activities against us, this conference calls on everyone to work together to suppress and eliminate these counter-revolutionary activities as quickly as possible, which is the necessary dictatorship over the reactionaries. Fang Fang, representative of the South China Sub-Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Li Zhangda, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, Lai Chuanzhu, representative of the Military Control Commission, Deng Hua, representative of the 15th Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Lin Ping, representative of the Guangdong Military Region, Liao Siguang, representative of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and representatives of various democratic parties and various sectors spoke at the opening session. The meeting listened to the report by Zhu Guang, the Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou, on "The Work of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government in the Past Month and Future Work," and the report by Wu Fushan, Political Commissar of the Garrison Command, on "Eliminating Bandits and Special Agents and Consolidating Public Security." These two reports and the proposals put forward by the representatives were discussed in group meetings and plenary meetings. At the meeting, representatives from all walks of life focused on the issue of public security work, put forward many opinions, and engaged in heated discussions. The participants unanimously agreed that the garrison troops and public security organs have made great efforts in public security work, but language barriers have increased the difficulties in their work. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize and organize the power of the people to eliminate special agents and bandits to consolidate the revolutionary order. All the representatives fully agreed with the four basic directions and ten specific tasks proposed by Wu Fushan in the report on "Eliminating Bandits and Special Agents and Consolidating Public Security." The meeting passed resolutions on endorsing the government's administrative work and public security work reports, a decision on the Guangzhou Municipal People's Representatives Conference Consultative Committee, and a list of the Consultative Committee members. It also passed a telegram of greetings to Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the People's Liberation Army, passed a telegram to the Central People's Government and the United Nations General Assembly "Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement Denying the Credentials of the Pseudo Delegation to the Current Session of the United Nations General Assembly," as well as proposals such as "Condolences to the uprising personnel of China, Central Aviation Corporation, and the former Resources Committee," "Please the Central People's Government to issue an order to arrest and punish Li Jilan, the culprit who presided over the bombing of the Haizhu Bridge, according to law," and "All roads in Guangzhou should restore their original names." Finally, Mayor Ye Jianying delivered the closing speech. He appealed to people from all walks of life to regularly supervise and check the government's implementation of the resolutions of the conference and expressed that he would work hard to do the necessary work in the future so that the People's Representatives Conference would soon be qualified to perform the functions of the People's Congress.
