Dear Comrade Chairman Mao,

Our Central Committee has just met on October 15th and 16th, and we are extremely excited to hear that Guangzhou has been liberated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This victory, coupled with previous victories, demonstrates the strength of the new People's Republic of China. The birth of the new People's Republic of China has been celebrated here as an important new force in the camp of freedom and peace, and as a great example for all oppressed people in their struggle for national liberation. Our Central Committee enthusiastically passed a proposal to send you the attached letter in order to express our warm congratulations to you. Dear Comrade, please accept the greetings of our comrades!

The congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Tunisian Communist Party to Chairman Mao is as follows:

To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:

On the occasion of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Tunisian Communist Party, which is convinced of representing the sentiments of the Tunisian people, extends its warmest congratulations to Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese people. The emergence of the People's Republic of China, brought about by the earth-shattering victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army—the liberation of Guangzhou being its most recent victory—is a most important historical event, one that strikes a powerful blow against world capitalism. It marks the liberation of 475 million people from the shackles of American and British imperialism and the reactionary feudalism it supports. The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, and the defeat of German and Japanese imperialism by the Soviet Union, made the victory of the Chinese people possible. The Chinese people's victory relies first and foremost on all their struggles on their own land, most notably the struggle of the People's Liberation Army. This victory greatly strengthens the democratic and peaceful camp, at the forefront of which stands the great Soviet Union of Lenin and Stalin, the pillar of peace, and the most reliable friend and selfless supporter of all oppressed people. This victory is a powerful encouragement to all oppressed nations, especially the Tunisian people, to strengthen their struggle for national liberation against imperialist oppression.

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

	The Central Committee of the Tunisian Communist Party
	October 15th

  　致函毛主席祝贺新中国
    【新华社布拉格六日电】突尼斯共产党中央委员会代表麦罕默德·昂那法于十月二十日致函毛主席，祝贺中华人民共和国诞生，并附来突尼斯共产党中央委员会贺函。
    麦罕默德·昂那法致毛主席的贺函如下：亲爱的毛主席同志：
    我们的中央委员会刚在十月十五、十六两天集会，听说广州已由中国人民解放军解放，使我们异常兴奋。这一胜利加上以前的胜利，表示着新的中华人民共国的力量。新的中华人民共和国的诞生，曾经在此间当作一个自由和平阵营的重要生力军，和一切被压迫人民在为他们民族解放的斗争中的伟大范例而进行庆祝。我们的中央委员会热诚地通过了将所附的信件送给你的提议，以便对你表示热烈祝贺。亲爱的同志，请接受我们的同志的敬礼！

    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　十月二十日
    突尼斯共产党中央委员会致毛主席的贺函如下：中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志：
    值此中华人民共和国成立之际，确信代表着突尼斯人民的情感的突尼斯共产党中央委员会，特向毛泽东同志、中国共产党和中国人民致最热烈的祝贺。由中国人民解放军惊天动地的胜利——解放广州是它最近的一个胜利——所促成的中华人民共和国的产生，是一个最重要的历史事件，这一历史事件给予世界资本主义一个有力的打击，它标志着四万万七千五百万人民从美英帝国主义和它们所支持的反动封建的枷锁中解放出来。社会主义在苏联的胜利，德日帝国主义被苏联击败，使中国人民的胜利有了可能。中国人民获得这一胜利，首先依靠他们在国土上的一切斗争，最显著的是人民解放军的斗争。这一胜利大大地增强了民主和平阵营，在这一阵营的前列，站在伟大的列宁、斯大林的苏联，它是和平的支柱，是一切被压迫人民最可靠的朋友和大公无私的支持者。这一胜利对一切被压迫民族，尤其对于突尼斯人民是一个加强他们为民族解放，反对帝国主义者压迫的斗争中有力的鼓励。
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　突尼斯共产党中央委员会
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　十月十五日
