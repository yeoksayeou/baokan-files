In the Soviet Union, the state invests great effort in cultivating a large number of scientific talents. There are now hundreds of thousands of scientific workers throughout the country. They work not only in schools or research institutes, but also in laboratories of factories and collective farms. Many outstanding scholars and scientific and technological innovators have come from the ranks of workers and peasants. In addition to the famous Soviet Academy of Sciences, the oldest Moscow University, and Leningrad University, there are hundreds of higher specialized schools and scientific research institutes throughout the country that train scientific researchers. Researchers are divided into two types: those who are trained as candidate doctors of science, and those who are trained as doctors of science.

Those who participate in candidate doctor training are subject to tests in their chosen subject, Marxism-Leninism, and two foreign languages upon admission, in addition to age and seniority restrictions. Then, under the guidance of experts, they independently conduct three years of research and training according to a plan. Coursework in dialectical materialism, historical materialism, specialized subjects, and two foreign languages must be completed by the end of the second academic year. In the final year, the entire research work focuses on the degree thesis, which is decisive for the evaluation of the degree. Those who have the qualifications of a candidate doctor, are proficient in foreign languages, and can conduct independent scientific research can be admitted to prepare for further training as a doctor. The research period is not fixed, but it should not exceed three years. During this period, knowledgeable experts still guide the research.

The Soviet government provides these researchers with many favorable conditions. They can receive high-level publicly funded scholarships, have twelve days of winter vacation and two months of summer vacation each year, and receive subsidies for collecting scientific data. Scholarships are distributed monthly on a proportional basis. They also have libraries with rich collections of books and well-equipped laboratories. If the candidate doctor's thesis, according to the examiners' criticism, meets the requirements, it can be used as a doctoral thesis, and the author of this thesis may be listed for a doctoral degree. Regarding the content of the thesis, they not only focus on its profound scientific theoretical value, but more importantly, they pay attention to the degree to which it is closely integrated with the people's lives and the practical socialist construction.

In this way, the Soviet Union has many new production innovators and inventors every year who create many new production methods, new science, and technology. They have won Stalin Prizes, and they are working hard for the Soviet Union's socialist production and construction.

　　苏联怎样培养科学人才
    在苏联，国家费了很大的力量在培养大批科学人才，全国科学工作者现已达十几万人，他们不但在学校或研究院里进行工作，也在工厂、集体农场的实验室里工作，其中并有不少的优秀学者和科学技术改革者都是从工农队伍里来的。除了著名的苏联科学院、历史最悠久的莫斯科大学及列宁格勒大学外，全国还有好几百所造就科学研究员的高级专门学校和科学研究院。研究员分二种，一种是造就科学候补博士，一种是造就科学博士。
    凡是参加候补博士训练的，除了年龄、资历的限制外，入学时要受所学的学科、马列主义和二种外国语的测验，然后在专家指导下，按照计划独立地进行三年的研究和训练。辩证唯物论，历史唯物论，专门学科和二种外国语的课业要在第二学年结束时就学完，最后一年整个研究工作是在评定学位有决定意义的学位论文上。有了候补博士的资格，能够精通外国语和自动作独立科学研究的人，就可以被录取准备进一步培养为博士，研究期限不一定，但最多不得超过三年，其间仍有学识渊博的专家指导研究。
    苏联政府给这些研究员有很多便利的条件，他们可以得到高级公费奖学金，每年有十二天寒假和二个月暑假，并支给收集科学资料的补助金，每月按比例分给奖学金，他们还有藏书丰富的图书馆，设备完善的实验室。如考候补博士的学位论文，按照考核者的批评，符合需要，可以作为博士论文，那这篇论文作者就可能列入博士学位了。论文的内容，他们不仅着重它的高深的科学理论价值，更重要的是注意它们和人民生活、和实际的社会主义建设紧密结合的程度。
    这样，使苏联每年有很多新的生产革新者和发明家来创造许多新的生产方法、新的科学技术，他们获得了斯大林奖金，他们在为苏联的社会主义生产建设事业努力。
