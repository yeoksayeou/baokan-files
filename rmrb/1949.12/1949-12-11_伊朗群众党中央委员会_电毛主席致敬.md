Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 8th: The Central Committee of the Iranian People's Party (formerly translated as the Labor Party) sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, congratulating him. The telegram reads as follows:

　　On the occasion of the establishment of the new government of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Iranian People's Party extends fraternal greetings to you. The victory won by the Chinese people under your leadership in the struggle against domestic reactionaries and foreign imperialism is of great historical significance, especially for the oppressed people of Asia.

　　From the earth-shattering victory of the Chinese Revolution, the Iranian people truly see the prelude to their own liberation from the long-standing shackles of foreign imperialism and the exploitation of feudal merchant groups. These feudal merchant groups, in order to protect their privileges and to effectively oppress our workers and peasants, like the traitorous Kuomintang, throw Iran into the plunder of foreign trusts. They violate the will of the Iranian people and turn our motherland into a base for Anglo-American aggressors against the great socialist country, Iran's true friend—the Soviet Union.

　　The Central Committee of the People's Party, representing the will of the vast majority of the Iranian people, takes this opportunity to warmly salute the Chinese workers and their People's Army, and their great Communist Party. This party, under your leadership, has won one of the most glorious victories in human histroy.

　　The Central Committee of the People's Party firmly believes that the establishment of the people's regime in Chinan is a great step toward the liberation of mankind, and undoubtedly strengthens the world's progressive and peace-loving camp.

　　Long live the great Chinese people and their great Communist Party! Long live the People's Republic of China and its great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong!
　　　　　　　　　　The Central Committee of the Iranian People's Party G. Esfandari

　　伊朗群众党中央委员会
  　电毛主席致敬
    【新华社北京八日电】伊朗群众党（前译为劳动党）中央委员会Ｇ·爱斯刚达里电贺毛主席，电文如下：
    在中华人民共和国的新政府成立之际，伊朗群众党中央委员会向你致兄弟的敬意。中国人民在你领导下反对国内反动派及外国帝国主义的斗争中所获得的胜利，有重大历史意义，特别是对于亚洲被压迫人民来说。
    伊朗人民从中国大革命的震天动地的胜利中，真正看到他们自己从悠久的外国帝国主义的枷锁和封建商人集团的剥削中解放的前奏。那些封建商人集团，为了保护他们的特权，为了有效地压迫我国工人和农民，象国民党卖国贼们一样，把伊朗投入外国托拉斯的掠夺中去。他们违反伊朗人民的意志，把我们的祖国变成英美侵略者反对伟大社会主义国家、伊朗真正的友人——苏联的基地。
    代表绝大多数伊朗人民的意志的群众党中央委员会，在这个机会热烈地向中国工人和他们的人民军队、他们伟大的共产党致敬。这个党在你的领导下，获得人类历史上最光辉胜利之一。
    群众党中央委员会深信，人民政权在中国的成立，是走向人类解放的伟大的一步，并且毫无疑问地加强了世界的进步和平阵营。
    伟大的中国人民和他们伟大的共产党万岁！中华人民共和国及其伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
  　　　　　　　　　　伊朗群众党中央委员会　Ｇ·爱斯刚达里
