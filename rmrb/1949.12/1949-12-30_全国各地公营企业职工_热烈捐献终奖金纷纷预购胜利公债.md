Public Enterprise Employees Across the Country Enthusiastically Donate Year-End Bonuses and Eagerly Purchase Victory Bonds

[This newspaper reported] The Central Financial and Economic Commission's decision "Regarding the Handling of Year-End Double Pay or Bonus Issues for Certain Public Enterprises" and the call from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions continue to receive enthusiastic support from employees of various public enterprises across the country. In addition to the previous reports of many employees in Beijing, Shanghai, Hankou, and other places willing to receive less or no year-end double pay or bonuses, employees of various public enterprises in Tianjin are also giving up their year-end bonuses or using their salaries to purchase public bonds. On the 27th of this month, all employees of the New River Material Warehouse of the Tianjin Material Bureau of the Ministry of Railways Materials Bureau voluntarily announced that they would donate all their year-end double pay or bonuses to support the front lines. All employees of the Fengtai Transportation Section of the Tianjin Railway Bureau unanimously agreed to forgo their year-end bonuses. Employees of the North China Chemical Company and its affiliated factories have already pre-purchased 330 shares of public bonds with their year-end bonuses. The North China Machine Manufacturing Company has pre-purchased 159 shares of public bonds. Chen Bangning of the company tightened his belt and decided to purchase 30 shares within three months, becoming a model for the company. In addition, more than 180 employees of the Dongya Tobacco Company pre-purchased more than 400 shares of public bonds at a staff meeting held yesterday. More than 100 employees of the No. 4 Textile Factory also signed up to pre-purchase public bonds yesterday.

All members of the Seafarers' Union Jiaohai Customs Seafarers Branch unanimously decided not to receive their year-end double pay or bonuses to help the government overcome financial difficulties. They previously wrote to the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government to express their firm determination, and Director Kong and Deputy Director Ding have replied with commendations.

Lutai Post and Telecommunications employees in eastern Hebei held a general staff meeting on the evening of December 27 to discuss the Financial and Economic Commission's handling of year-end double pay. More than 20 employees spoke enthusiastically, unanimously expressing their desire not to receive bonuses or double pay, and to further intensify their work to welcome the 1950 construction plan. At the same time, considering that the salaries of post and telecommunications employees in eastern Hebei are half that of those in Tianjin, Beijing, and Tanggu, employees have been taking out part of their monthly salaries to relieve disaster victims. They requested that employees with higher salaries in Beijing, Tianjin, Tanggu, and other places voluntarily reduce their salaries or take out a portion for disaster relief to jointly overcome difficulties and complete the construction tasks of the New Democracy.

In East China, employees of the Nanjing China Merchants Bureau, the Suzhou Postal Workers' Union, the Yixing Telecommunications Bureau, the Anqing Telecommunications Bureau, the Anqing Branch of the China Merchants Bureau, the Hangzhou Electric Power Company, and other units have also donated their year-end bonuses or double pay. All employees of the Yixing Telecommunications Bureau requested that a total of more than two million yuan in year-end double pay and bonuses be waived, saving the country a considerable amount of expenditure.

In Central and South China, the donation of year-end double pay and bonuses initiated by employees of the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau in Hunan Province has spread throughout the province. In the ten days up to the 24th, the donation campaign has expanded to 23 counties and cities, including Changde, Hengyang, and Yueyang. All employees of 40 public enterprise units, including telecommunications, postal services, shipping, railways, highways, coal mines, and electrical machinery, donated all their year-end bonuses to the country. 90% of the employees of units such as the Hunan Postal Bureau and the Xiangtan Highway Station donated all their year-end bonuses. The majority of employees of the Second Transportation Department of the Provincial Highway Bureau also donated 50% to 80% of their bonuses. Workers from the Highway Bureau pointed out: The government is currently facing financial difficulties, and if we take double pay, it will increase the issuance of paper money, causing price fluctuations and affecting people's lives. All employees of the Linchuan Telecommunications Bureau in Jiangxi Province have also sent a telegram stating that they will not receive year-end bonuses or double pay.

After receiving a telegram from employees of the Changsha Branch of the China Merchants Bureau calling for the donation of year-end double pay and bonuses on the 21st, all 200-plus employees of the newly liberated Chongqing Branch of the China Merchants Bureau immediately signed up in response. The telegram from the Changsha Branch was also forwarded to all employees of the "201" and "203" landing craft and the Jiangqing wheel, which were sailing downstream, requesting that they respond in unison.

    【本报讯】中央财政经济委员会“关于某些公营企业年终双薪或奖金问题处理办法”的决定和中华全国总工会的号召，继续受到全国各地各公营企业部门职工的热烈拥护。除北京、上海、汉口等地许多职工愿意少领或不领年终双薪或奖金的实际行动已见前讯外，天津市各公营企业单位职工，亦纷纷放弃年终奖金或以薪金认购公债。铁道部材料局天津材料局新河材料库全体职工于本月二十七日自动宣布将年终双薪或奖金全部支援前线；天津铁路局丰台车务段全体职工一致通过不要年终奖金；华北化学公司及所属各厂职工将年终奖金预购公债已达三百三十分；华北机器制造公司已预购公债一百五十九分，该公司陈邦宁节衣缩食，决定在三个月内认购三十分，成为该公司的模范。此外，东亚烟草公司昨日召开职工大会时当场一百八十余人预购公债四百余分。中纺四厂昨日亦有一百余人签名预购公债。
    海员工会胶海关海员支会全体会员为帮助政府克服财政困难，一致不领年终双薪或奖金。日前曾上书中央人民政府海关总署作坚决表示，孔署长丁副署长已复电表扬。
    冀东芦台邮电职工于十二月廿七日晚召开全体职工大会，讨论财委会关于年终双薪处理办法时，二十多名职工热烈发言，一致表示不领奖金双薪而且还要更进一步的加紧工作，迎接一九五○年的建设计划。同时按冀东邮电职工薪金比较津京塘少一倍，职工在每月发薪时都拿出了一部救济灾胞，他们要求北京、天津、塘沽等地薪金高的职工自动减薪或拿出部分救灾，共同克服困难完成新民主主义的建设任务。
    华东地区南京招商局职工、苏州邮政工会、宜兴电信局、安庆电信局和招商局安庆分局、杭州电力公司等各单位的职工，也纷纷捐献年终奖励金或双薪。宜兴电信局全体职工要求免发的年终双薪、奖金共达二百多万元，为国家节省了一笔开支。
