Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: Tass, New York: The National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association held a mass meeting at Madison Square on the 5th, entitled "Declare the Atomic Bomb Illegal." Approximately 12,000 people attended, and they pledged to intensify and expand the struggle against war-mongers within the United States.

The Polish representative to the United Nations, Katz-Suchy, delivered a speech at the meeting, emphasizing that the struggle for peace and the consolidation of friendship between the American and Soviet people are the most urgent tasks facing humanity today. Suchy stressed that declaring the atomic bomb illegal is the first step towards American-Soviet cooperation. In his concluding remarks, Suchy said: As schemes of aggression are developing in West Germany and elsewhere, we know that the people's peace is the desire of millions upon millions of people in Europe, Asia, and everywhere. We know that the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are defending peace today. We know that millions upon millions of men and women are defending peace, vowing to oppose war and fight for peace. We are optimistic about the future because we believe in the power of the people. Because we know that no weapon can stop the desire for peace.

The Chairman of the National Committee of the American Progressive Party, former Governor of Minnesota, Benson, stated in his speech at the meeting that what he recently heard and saw during his visit to Eastern Europe demonstrated that war hysteria is completely non-existent there. He contrasted the friendly welcome in Warsaw with the ridiculous attempts by officials of the American embassy there to incite him against the Polish people. Benson emphasized that the aggressive "North Atlantic Treaty forces living standards to decrease everywhere and directly increases, rather than decreases, the dependence of all aspects of life in Western Europe even more on the United States." Benson also said: All his experiences in Europe had convinced him of the need to intensify the struggle to stop America's war movement. He said: The atomic bomb must be declared an illegal weapon immediately. Armaments must be reduced, living standards must be raised, and trade must be encouraged.

The conference received congratulatory telegrams from the All-Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Soong Ching Ling, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson, Chilean poet Neruda, and the Joliot-Curies, among others.

　　纽约万余群众集会
  　宣布原子弹非法
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美苏友好协会全国委员会于五日在麦迪逊广场举行“宣布原子弹非法”的群众大会。与会者约一万二千人，他们保证加紧和扩大反对美国国内战争贩子的斗争。
    波兰驻联合国代表卡茨·苏琪在大会上发表演说，强调争取和平的斗争和巩固美苏人民之间的友谊，是人类现在面临的最迫切任务。苏琪着重地说：宣布原子弹非法是走向美苏合作的第一步。苏琪在结语时说：当侵略阴谋在西德和其他各地发展的时候，我们知道人民的和平是欧洲、亚洲和一切地方千千万万人民的愿望。我们知道，苏联和人民民主国家今天在保卫和平。我们知道，千千万万男男女女在保卫和平，他们矢言反对战争，并将为和平而斗争。我们对于前途是乐观的，因为我们相信人民的力量。因为我们知道任何武器都不能阻止对和平的愿望。
    美国进步党全国委会员主席、前明尼苏达州州长宾生在大会上发表演说称，他最近访问东欧时耳闻目见的情况，说明在那里战争歇斯底里是完全不存在的。他把华沙的友好欢迎和该地美国大使馆的官员煽动他反对波兰人民的可笑企图，作了一个对比。宾生着重地说，侵略性的“北大西洋公约迫使各地的生活水准降低，而且直接地增加了而不是减少了西欧生活的各个方面更对美国的依赖性。”宾生又说：他在欧洲所得到的全部经验，使他深信必须加紧制止美国的战争运动的斗争。他说：必须立即宣布原子弹为非法武器。必须裁减军备，提高生活水准，并必须鼓励贸易。
    大会收到全苏对外文化协会、宋庆龄、坎特伯雷大主教约翰逊、智利诗人尼鲁达和约里奥——居里夫妇等人的贺电。
