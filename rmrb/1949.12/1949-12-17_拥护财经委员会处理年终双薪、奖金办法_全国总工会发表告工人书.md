Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 15th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in support of the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Commission's handling of the issue of year-end double pay or bonuses in certain public enterprises, issued a letter to workers today. A person in charge of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: The Federation of Trade Unions requires trade unions at all levels to organize meetings of workers and staff in factories and enterprises to discuss this document. The full text of the letter to workers is as follows: Workers and staff in public enterprises across the country:

　　The end of 1949, the year in which the people's liberation cause won unprecedented great victory, is fast approaching. In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang, some public enterprises had, as a result of long-term struggles by workers, obtained the benefit of year-end double pay or bonuses. Based on the current serious financial difficulties faced by the country in its victory, and the inconsistent situation in which year-end double pay was given to varying degrees or not at all in various public enterprises in the past, the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Commission issued a circular on the handling of this old practice at the end of this year, deciding: "1. All public enterprises that originally did not issue year-end double pay or bonuses shall continue not to issue them. 2. All public enterprises that originally issued year-end double pay or bonuses, but not exceeding half a month's wages, shall issue them according to the original stipulated amount. 3. All public enterprises that originally issued year-end double pay or bonuses exceeding half a month's wages shall issue half a month's double pay or bonus as usual, and the excess part shall be halved, but shall not exceed two months' wages at most, and may be issued in installments." The All-China Federation of Trade Unions believes that the method decided by the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Commission is the most appropriate method that takes into account both the state's financial difficulties and the economic interests of the workers. Therefore, it specifically calls on all workers and staff in public enterprises across the country to unanimously and resolutely support this decision of the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Commission.

　　Our workers and staff in public enterprises were completely slaves in bureaucratic capitalist enterprises before liberation, suffering oppression and exploitation, suffering insult and bullying, without any freedom or rights, and simply living a subhuman life. At that time, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we carried out long-term arduous struggles to oppose this cruel oppression and strive for improvement in our lives. For example, year-end double pay or bonuses, etc., were one of the results obtained through this long-term struggle. However, the purpose of our working class in carrying out this struggle in the past was not simply to obtain small improvements in living conditions, but to fundamentally overthrow the reactionary rule of the imperialist lackey Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, to build a new democratic country led by our working class, so that we could control our own destiny, create a happy future through our own efforts, and achieve the goal of a socialist society without the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man, which our working class aspires to. After many years of bloodshed, sacrifice, and heroic struggle, our Chinese working class has finally achieved victory on a national scale. We have changed from being oppressed slaves to being the masters of the country and the leading class of the new democratic New China! We are no longer oppressed or bullied, no longer insulted or scolded, we have obtained all democratic freedoms and all political rights. In the past, those who worked were looked down upon, but now they are respected by everyone in society. This earth-shaking fundamental change is because the state power in the past was the power of feudal compradors and bureaucratic capital, so our workers were oppressed. The current state power is the people's power led by our working class, so no one can oppress our workers. Therefore, the most important and greatest victory fruit we have obtained through decades of arduous struggle is the acquisition of the new democratic state power led by our working class. However, our enemies, imperialism and feudalism, the reactionary forces of bureaucratic capital, have not given up. They are still making their last struggles, still carrying out armed resistance, still using methods such as blockade and bombing to sabotage our work of restoring the economy, and are still trying to sabotage our state power, plotting to restore their rule and plunge us back into slavery. This has also increased the difficulties we face in victory, first of all, it has increased the country's various expenditures, causing our country's finances to be unable to make ends meet. Therefore, the serious problem currently facing our workers and the people of the whole country is: how to overcome all the current difficulties, especially the current financial difficulties of the People's Government, so as to effectively support the People's Liberation Army, liberate the entire Southwest and Tibet, liberate Hainan Island, liberate Taiwan, completely eliminate the base for the revival of counter-revolution, and strive for the final victory of the whole of China. And on this basis, to seek a rapid restoration and development of production, and build our own democratic and happy new country. To achieve this goal, we can only rely on our working class to unite with the people of the whole country to fight together, with the spirit of sacrificing self for the public, tightening our belts and helping the country to overcome the current financial difficulties and all the difficulties encountered in victorious development. Therefore, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions specifically calls on you: In order to consolidate the victory already obtained by our working class and the people of the whole country, in order to consolidate the new democratic power led by the working class itself, in order to lay the foundation for building a democratic and happy new China, we must endure temporary difficulties with the traditional spirit of heroic struggle and perseverance of our working class, and take eating bitterness, doing more, tightening our belts, and actively producing as a model for the people of the whole country to strive to build the country!

　　Workers and staff in public enterprises across the country! Use our working class's practical actions with a high degree of political awareness to actively support and implement the Government Administration Council's handling of the issue of year-end double pay or bonuses! As for the workers and staff in private enterprises, with regard to the old practice of year-end double pay or bonuses, they should also, through the trade union, consult with the capitalists based on the specific circumstances of the profits and losses of various private enterprises, in accordance with the general policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital. Our Chinese working class not only has the tradition of heroic struggle and overcoming difficulties, but also has the spirit of having a broad vision and taking care of the overall situation. Let us workers and the people of the whole country work together to overcome all difficulties, strive for the rapid and complete victory of the whole country, and build a democratic and happy new China!

　　拥护财经委员会处理年终双薪、奖金办法
  　全国总工会发表告工人书
    【新华社北京十五日电】中华全国总工会，为拥护政务院财政经济委员会关于某些公营企业原有年终双薪或奖金问题的处理办法，在今天发表了告工人书。全国总工会负责人说：总工会要求各级工会在工厂企业中组织工人职员会议来讨论这个文件。告工人书的全文如下：全国各公营企业中的工人、职员们：
    在全国人民解放事业获得空前伟大胜利的一九四九年的年终就快要到来了。某些公营企业原来在国民党统治时代，由于工人长期斗争的结果，获得有年终双薪或奖金的待遇。政务院财政经济委员会根据目前国家在胜利中遇到的严重的财政困难及过去在各种公营企业中发给年终双薪或多或少或有或无的不一致的情况，发表了今年年终对此项旧例处理办法的通告，决定“一、所有公营企业原来不发年终双薪或奖金者，一律照旧不发。二、所有公营企业原来发给年终双薪或奖金，但不超过半个月工资者，照原来规定数目发给。三、所有公营企业原来发给年终双薪或奖金超过半个月工资者，除照发半个月的双薪或奖金外，其超过部分一律折半发给，但最多不得超过两个月的工资，并可分期发给。”中华全国总工会认为：政务院财经委员会决定的办法是既照顾国家财政困难，又照顾工人经济利益的最恰当的办法。因此，特号召全国所有公营企业中的工人职员，一致坚决拥护政务院财政经济委员会的这个决定。
    我们公营企业中的工人职员，在未解放以前，完全是官僚资本企业中的奴隶，遭受压迫剥削，遭受侮辱欺凌，没有半点自由权利，简直过着非人的生活。那时我们在中国共产党领导下，进行长期的艰苦斗争，反对这种残酷的压迫，争取生活的改善。譬如年终双薪或奖金等等，便是这种长期斗争所获得的结果之一。但是我们工人阶级过去进行这种斗争的目的，则不简单是为了获得生活条件的细小的改善，而是为了根本推翻帝国主义走狗国民党官僚资本的反动统治，建设一个以我们工人阶级为领导的新民主主义的国家，使我们能够自己掌握自己的命运，能够以我们自己的努力创造幸福的将来，以达到我们工人阶级所理想的没有人剥削人现象的社会主义社会的目的。我们中国工人阶级经过多少年来的流血牺牲，英勇奋斗，到今天终于获得全国范围的胜利，我们已经从被压迫的奴隶地位，变成了国家的主人，变成了新民主主义新中国的领导阶级了！我们不再受人压迫欺凌了，不再受人侮辱打骂了，我们获得了一切民主自由，获得了一切政治上的权利。从前做工的人是被人看不起的，现在是被社会上大家尊重的了。这种翻天覆地的根本变化，就是由于过去的国家政权是封建买办官僚资本的政权，所以我们工人受压迫，现在的国家政权是我们工人阶级领导的人民政权，所以谁也不能压迫我们工人了。因此，我们几十年来艰苦斗争所获得的最主要的最大的胜利果实，就是取得了由我们工人阶级领导的新民主主义的国家政权。但是，我们的敌人，帝国主义和封建主义、官僚资本反动势力并没有死心，他们还在作最后的挣扎，还在进行武装反抗，还在用封锁轰炸等方法来破坏我们恢复经济的工作，还正在企图破坏我们的国家政权，阴谋恢复他们的统治，把我们重新打入奴隶地位。这也就增加了我们在胜利中的困难，首先是增加了国家的各种经费开支，使我们国家财政入不敷出。所以现在摆在我们工人和全国人民面前的严重问题是：怎样克服当前的一切困难，特别是人民政府当前的财政困难，以便有力地支援人民解放军，解放全部西南和西藏，解放海南岛，解放台湾，彻底铲除反革命复活的基地，争取全中国的最后胜利。并在这一基础上，求得迅速地恢复与发展生产，建设起我们自己的民主幸福的新国家。要达到这个目的，就只有依靠我们工人阶级团结全国人民共同奋斗，用舍私为公的精神，节衣缩食，帮助国家来战胜当前的财政困难以及在胜利发展中所遇到的一切困难。因此中华全国总工会特号召你们：为了巩固我们工人阶级和全国人民已得的胜利，为了巩固工人阶级自己领导的新民主主义的政权，为了奠定建设一个民主幸福的新中国的基础，必须以我们工人阶级英勇奋斗和坚韧耐劳的传统精神忍受暂时的困难，以吃得苦、做得多，节衣缩食，积极生产，来作为全国人民努力建国的模范！
    全国各公营企业中的工人、职员们！用我们工人阶级具有高度政治觉悟的实际行动，来积极支持并执行政务院财经委员会关于年终双薪或奖金问题的处理办法吧！至于私营企业中的工人、职员们，对于年终双薪或奖金的旧例，也应当经过工会，根据各种私营企业盈亏的具体情况，本着发展生产劳资两利的总方针，与资方进行协商解决。我们中国工人阶级不仅具有英勇奋斗，克服困难的传统，而且也具有眼光远大，照顾大局的精神。让我们工人与全国人民在一起，来为战胜一切困难，争取全国迅速彻底的胜利，建立民主幸福的新中国而共同奋斗！
