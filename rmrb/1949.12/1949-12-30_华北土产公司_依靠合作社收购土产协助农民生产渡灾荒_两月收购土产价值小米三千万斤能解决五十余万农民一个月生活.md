　　North China Native Produce Company
    Relies on Cooperatives to Purchase Native Produce to Help Farmers Produce and Overcome Disasters
    Two Months of Native Produce Purchases Valued at 30 Million Jin of Millet, Enough to Solve the Monthly Living Expenses of More Than 500,000 Farmers
    Combining Government's Autumn Grain Collection with Native Produce Purchases Brings Great Benefits to Farmers
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] In order to develop industrial and agricultural production, actively open up foreign trade, and organize a large number of native products for export, and help farmers in winter production and overcome disasters, the North China Native Produce Company has achieved results and gained experience. From November to mid-December, the company purchased 21 kinds of commodities, including mountain goods, medicinal materials, minerals, and miscellaneous grains, totaling more than 14.4 million jin, and more than 40,000 bolts of homespun cloth. This can be converted into more than 31 million jin of millet. Assuming that each farmer needs 60 jin of grain per month, this can solve the full month's living expenses of more than 500,000 farmers.
    In November, the company exported more than 14.4 million jin of only ten commodities, including bitter almonds, bean cakes, peach kernels, and straw hats.
    In order to prepare for the launch of native produce exchanges between North China, Northeast China, Central China, and East China next spring, the company sent out three investigation teams to Northeast China, Central China, and East China, and also sent out a portion of trial sales goods. North China is rich in white hemp, sulfur, asbestos, gypsum, and other industrial raw materials, and production will increase with the development of the national construction cause. In November, the company's domestic native produce exchanges to Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Northeast China and other places increased more than six times compared with October.
    During this period of native produce operation, the company has gained the following experience:
    1. State-owned commercial operations of native produce must be closely linked and rely on cooperatives. During this period, relying on cooperatives to purchase native produce has achieved great results. For example, the Shijiazhuang branch company purchased through cooperatives, accounting for 43.48% of the total purchase volume.
    Due to the close combination of state-owned commerce and cooperatives, both parties have gained business development. For example, the Handan branch company relied on the cooperative to complete the company's purchase task. The Rencun Cooperative in Lin County had a capital of one million yuan and more than 3,000 members in the past. Later, because it collected peach kernels for the native produce company, its capital has increased four times and its members have doubled, and the cooperative's prestige has also been improved. Some branch companies have signed barter contracts with cooperatives, such as the Changzhi branch company and the Pingshun County Cooperative, which signed a contract to exchange millet, salt, and cloth for hemp skin and codonopsis pilosula, reducing intermediate exploitation and solving the difficulties of grain, salt, cloth and other daily necessities for the masses in the disaster-stricken areas of Pingshun.
    However, some problems have also occurred in the combination, such as the contract is not specific enough, the time is long, the quantity is large, sometimes the goods cannot be delivered on time, and the quality is poor. We should pay attention to overcoming these problems in the future.
    2. Adopting the method of combining with the government's autumn grain collection during the purchase is of great benefit to the masses. For example, the Changzhi branch company, in cooperation with the Changzhi Special Office's autumn grain collection, stipulated a method of converting mountain goods and native produce into public grain. The masses handed over the mountain goods and native produce to the native produce company through the cooperative, and converted them into millet according to the different qualities of the goods. Then, the native produce company handed over this part of the rice to the government. In this way, the masses not only reduced the trouble of selling native produce and buying grain, but also prevented the price of native produce from falling and the price of grain from rising due to the urgency of selling native produce and buying grain, causing farmers to suffer losses. On the part of the native produce company, it completed the purchase task, helped the government complete the grain collection task, and adjusted grain and stabilized grain prices.
    3. The method of adjusting what is available and exchanging native produce for native produce was adopted in the purchase. Most of the areas where native produce is purchased are grain-deficient areas, such as Yangcheng, Zuoquan, and Geshun in Shanxi, the Bo'ai mining area in the plains, and the mountainous areas of Jianping, Yixian, and Shexian in Hebei, which are rich in peach kernels, pepper, hemp skin, etc., but lack grain, cloth, salt, etc. The masses all require to exchange mountain goods for these daily necessities; exchanging native produce for native produce is the best way to solve this requirement of the masses. In November, the Changzhi branch company purchased more than 130,000 jin of white hemp and more than 45,000 jin of codonopsis pilosula with 183,000 square feet of homespun cloth. The Shijiazhuang branch company also purchased more than 30,000 bolts of homespun cloth in the cloth production area and carried out adjustments in the mountain goods production area.
    In order to further solve the daily necessities of the masses in the native produce areas, the North China Native Produce Company has planned to sign contracts with the North China Salt Industry, Department Store, and Oil companies to exchange salt, department stores, oil, etc. for a large amount of native produce.

### 华北土产公司  依靠合作社收购土产协助农民生产渡灾荒  两月收购土产价值小米三千万斤能解决五十余万农民一个月生活

　　华北土产公司
    依靠合作社收购土产协助农民生产渡灾荒
    两月收购土产价值小米三千万斤能解决五十余万农民一个月生活
    结合政府秋征收购土产农民得到很大利益
    【本报讯】华北土产公司为了发展工农业生产，积极打开对外贸易，大量组织土产出口，并扶助农民冬季生产，战胜灾荒，已取得成绩和经验。该公司从十一月到十二月中旬，收购山货、药材、矿产、杂粮等二十一宗商品，共一千四百余万斤，土布四万余匹。可折小米三千一百余万斤，如按每个农民每月需粮六十斤计算，可解决五十余万农民之全月生活。
    该公司十一月份对外输出上，仅苦杏仁、豆饼、桃仁、草帽等十宗商品，即达一千四百余万斤。
    该公司为了准备明春开展华北、东北、华中、华东土产交流，曾派出东北、华中、华东三个调查小组，并发出试销货一部分。华北区盛产白麻、硫磺、石棉、石膏及其他工业原料，将随着全国建设事业的开展而增加生产。十一月份该公司运往上海、郑州、东北等地硫磺、花椒、药材等较十月份内国土产交流增加六倍强。
    在这一时期的土产经营中，该公司已取得下列经验：
    一、国营商业经营土产，必须紧密联系和依靠合作社，这一时期依靠合作社收购土产是有很大成绩的。如石家庄分公司，通过合作社收购的数量，占总收购数的百分之四三点四八。
    由于国营商业和合作社密切结合，双方都获得了业务上的开展。如邯郸分公司，依靠合作社完成了该公司收购任务。林县任村合作社，过去有资金一百万元，社员三千余人，后因给土产公司代收桃仁，到现在资金增加了四倍，社员增加了一倍，社的威信也因而提高了。有些分支公司与合作社订立换货合同，如长治支公司与平顺县社订立以小米、盐、布交换麻皮，党参的合同，减少了中间剥削，解决了平顺灾区群众粮食、盐、布匹等日用品的困难。
    但在结合中，也发生了一些问题，如订立合同不够具体，时间长，数量大，有时不能按时交货，而且质量差等问题。今后应注意克服。
    二、在收购时采用与政府秋征结合的办法，对群众有很大利益。如长治支公司，配合长治专署秋征，定出山货、土产折合交公粮的办法，群众把山货、土产通过合作社交给土产公司，按不同的货品质量，折成小米，然后土产公司把这部分米交给政府。这样，群众既减少了卖土产和买粮食麻烦，又不致因急于出售土产和急于买粮，而促使土产价格下跌，粮价上升，使农民吃亏。在土产公司方面，即完成了收购任务，又帮助政府完成了征粮任务，和调剂粮食，稳定粮价等。
    三、收购中采取了调剂有无，以土产换土产的办法。收购土产地区大部是缺粮地区，如山西之阳城、左权、各顺，平原之博爱矿区，河北之建屏、易县、涉县山地，均盛产桃仁、花椒、麻皮等，但都缺乏粮、布、盐等，群众都要求用山货换取这些日用品；以土产换土产，是解决群众这种要求的最好办法。长治支公司十一月份以土布十八万三千方尺，收购白麻十三万余斤，党参四万五千余斤。石家庄分公司，也在产布区收购土布三万余匹，到出产山货地区进行调剂。
    为了进一步解决土产区群众的日用必需品，华北土产公司，已计划与华北盐业、百货、油脂等公司、订立合同，以盐、百货、石油等，大量换取土产。
