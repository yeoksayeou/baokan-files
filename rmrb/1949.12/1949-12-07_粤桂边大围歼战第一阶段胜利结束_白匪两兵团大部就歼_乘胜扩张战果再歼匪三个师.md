Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 6th: The great encirclement and annihilation campaign carried out by the People's Liberation Army against Bai Chongxi's bandit troops on the Guangdong-Guangxi border has victoriously concluded its first stage. In this stage of the operation, the People's Liberation Army annihilated most of the remnants of the Bai bandit's Third and Eleventh Army Corps, and captured a large number of high-ranking bandit military officers, including Zhang Gan, deputy commander of the bandit "Central China Military and Political Office" and commander of the Third Army Corps, and Li Zhengzhong, chief of staff of the Eleventh Army Corps. From November 22nd to December 2nd, the East and South Route People's Liberation Army, advancing into Guangxi, captured and annihilated the main force of Bai Chongxi's bandit troops, the Third Army Corps and its commanded Seventh Army, Forty-eighth Army (both armies were annihilated by two divisions each in the Hengbao Campaign, and this time they were reorganized by the Bai bandits with miscellaneous troops), the 126th Army, the Eleventh Army Corps and its commanded Fifty-eighth Army, as well as the remnants of Yu Hanmou's bandit Fourth Army Corps, the Twenty-third Army, the Seventieth Army, and the 321st Division of the 109th Army, formerly under the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, who moved north from the Leizhou Peninsula to support the Bai bandits' southward escape, and the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column, etc., in the Rong County, Yulin, Bobai, Hua County, Xinyi, and Lianjiang areas on the Guangdong-Guangxi border. After a week of fierce pursuit and interception, the People's Liberation Army first encountered the bandit Seventh Army and Forty-eighth Army attempting to break through and escape south on November 26th and 27th north of Hua County, inflicting heavy casualties. The enemy then turned north and fled.

At that time, another unit of our army swiftly advanced westward from Luo Ding, attacking the bandit Eleventh Army Corps and the Fifty-eighth Army east of Rong County. Once in contact, the enemy quickly fled again. The People's Liberation Army pursued closely, captured Rong County and Beiliu on the 28th, and in one fell swoop annihilated most of the bandit Eleventh Army Corps headquarters and its Fifty-eighth Army and the Temporary First Division of the Ninety-seventh Army in Yangmeiwei, Rong County, and Beiliu, capturing Li Zhengzhong, chief of staff of the bandit Eleventh Army Corps, and killing Hu Ruoyu, deputy commander of the bandit Eleventh Army Corps, Cheng Xueyu, chief of staff of the Fifty-eighth Army, and Wang Shaochai, commander of the 226th Division, and many others, and shot down two bandit planes in the battle.

At this time, the bandit Third Army Corps, commanding the Seventh Army, Forty-eighth Army, and 126th Army, quickly shrank to the east and south of Bobai. The People's Liberation Army, which had captured Beiliu, marched 300 li in a day and night, pursuing swiftly, and quickly captured Yulin and Bobai on the 30th of last month and the 1st of this month, and eliminated the bandit Third Army Corps command post in Bobai City, capturing Zhang Gan, deputy commander of the bandit "Central China Commander-in-Chief Office" and commander of the Third Army Corps, Li Ying, commander of the 175th Division of the bandit Forty-eighth Army, and many others. Under the converging encirclement and attack of the People's Liberation Army's various pursuing armies, after a day of fierce fighting on the 1st of this month, most of the three armies of the bandit Seventh Army, Forty-eighth Army, and 126th Army were annihilated in the area between Bobai and Luchuan, with few escaping.

When the main force of the Bai bandits fled south, the remnants of Yu Hanmou's bandit Fourth Army Corps, the Twenty-third Army, the Seventieth Army, and the 321st Division of the 109th Army, and the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column, etc., moved north from the Leizhou Peninsula on the 28th of last month to support the southward escape, and the remnants of the bandit Fourth Army Corps headquarters even sneaked into Lianjiang on the 29th. On the 30th of last month, the People's Liberation Army launched a counterattack from the northeast and northwest of Lianjiang towards the bandit area, recaptured Lianjiang City, and completely annihilated the bandit Twenty-third Army and the 321st Division, the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column, etc., capturing Yu Yingqi, the former lieutenant general commander of the "Guibian East District Bandit Suppression Headquarters" and commander of the bandit 321st Division, and Lei Ying, commander of the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Column, etc. The bandit Fourth Army Corps headquarters and the Seventieth Army fled back to Zhanjiang in disgrace. So far, the People's Liberation Army has victoriously concluded the first stage of the great encirclement and annihilation campaign on the Guangdong-Guangxi border and is now dividing its forces to block and pursue the remnants of the bandit Xu Qiming Army Corps, Huang Jie Army Corps, and Liu Jiashu Army Corps, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 6th: The Guangdong-Guangxi border encirclement and annihilation campaign continues to expand its victories. On the 5th, the People's Liberation Army, in the area of Pingnan Market and Fengtang Market between Lingshan and Heng County, encircled and annihilated the bandit 125th Army and its three divisions, the 183rd Division, the 362nd Division, and the Temporary Second Division, which were attempting to escape to Hainan Island via Qin County. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the battle was resolved on the morning of the 6th, completely annihilating the bandits, with no one escaping, and capturing more than 10,000 bandits below the rank of army commander Chen Kairong.

Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 6th: In the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, two puppet county magistrates in Guangxi led their troops to surrender. Jiang Wenbo (with the rank of major general), the puppet county magistrate of Quan County, who had been roaming the mountains in northern Guangxi, recently led more than 300 of his troops to surrender to the Ludong Detachment of our Guibei People's Guerrilla General Team. He Fengchuan, the puppet county magistrate of Beiliu County in southeastern Guangxi, led the puppet county government and 76 members of the county defense general team to surrender to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the 3rd.
