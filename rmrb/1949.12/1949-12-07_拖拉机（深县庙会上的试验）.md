　　Tractor
    (Experiment at the Shen County Temple Fair)
    Xu Debiao
    Woo! Woo! Woo!…
    The tractor's engine roars,
    It's like a "water monster,"
    Attracting the crowds at the temple fair;
    Flowing toward the outside of the city.
    × × ×
    Arriving at a flat area outside the city,
    Toot! Toot! Toot!
    It roars a few times, and begins its performance.
    A string of plow disks digs into the soil,
    Waves of earth a dozen feet wide are turned up behind it;
    In the blink of an eye, it's plowed a long stretch.
    In just over ten minutes, it plows one mu of land.
    × × ×
    Tens of millions of eyes are fixed on it,
    Countless people are praising it with amazement.
    This one says: "It's much stronger than an ox,"
    That one says: "It plows both wide and deep and neat,"
    This one says: "Look how good it is,"
    That one says: "Doesn't eat, doesn't drink, and doesn't take much effort;"
    This one says: "Good as it is, we can't afford it,"
    That one says: "Government loans are no problem,"
    This one says: "Who among the common people knows how to drive this?"
    That one says: "Don't worry, someone will definitely teach you."

　　拖拉机
    （深县庙会上的试验）
    徐德表
    呜！呜！呜！……
    拖拉机的马达响着
    它象个“水怪”，
    吸引着庙会上的人群；
    向城外流去。
    ×    ×    ×
    走到郊外一块平地上，
    嘟！嘟！嘟！
    它咆哮了几声，表演起来。
    一串的犁盘伸进土里，
    丈来宽的土浪在它后边翻起；
    眨眼就是一拖长。
    十几分钟就耕完了一亩地。
    ×　　×　　×
    千万只眼睛盯着它，
    无数的人都称赞惊奇。
    这个说：“比牛劲大得多，”
    那个说：“耕的又宽又深又整齐，”
    这个说：“你看多么好，”
    那个说：“不吃不喝又不费力；”
    这个说：“好是好，可是咱买不起，”
    那个说：“政府贷款无问题，”
    这个说：“这个老百姓谁会驶？”
    那个说：“不用愁保管有人教会你。”
