　　Tianjin Private Merchants Go to Other Places to Purchase Export Goods
　　Application for Acceptance Financing is Exceptionally Enthusiastic
　　Bank of China Develops Purchase Certificates Worth More Than 4 Billion Yuan
　　[This Newspaper's Report] Since the Bank of China in Tianjin stopped export loans on the 15th of last month, in accordance with the instructions of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank, it has continued to operate inter-port acceptance financing business within a certain limit in order to buy time to support the export of native products. From the second half of last month to the 7th of this month, it issued purchase certificates for public and private enterprises and manufacturers totaling more than 4 billion yuan. Among the private acceptance financing, the purchase of straw hats and hemp hats in Shanghai was the largest, followed by the purchase of wool and other export goods in Xuzhou, Shijiazhuang, Jining, and Bengbu. Private manufacturers are exceptionally enthusiastic in applying for acceptance financing, mainly because general loans were once suspended, manufacturers were short of funds and needed working capital, and recently prices have stabilized and exchange rates have been adjusted, which is beneficial to most exports.

　　津私商赴外地采购出口物资
  　申请押汇异常踊跃
    中行开发采购证达四十余亿元
    【本报讯】天津市中国银行自上月十五日遵照人民银行天津分行指示，停止出口贷款后，为了争取时间扶助土产出口，对埠际押汇业务在一定额度内仍继续营作。在上月下半月至本月七日止，共开出公私营企业厂商购卖证达四十余亿元。私营押汇中以赴沪采购草帽、麻帽为大宗，其次为徐州、石家庄、集宁、蚌埠购卖羊毛等出口物资。私营厂商申请营作押汇者异常踊跃，主要原因，原由于一般贷款曾一度停止，厂商头寸紧迫，需要资金周转，和近日物价平稳，牌价调整，对大部出口有利所致。
