Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 13th: The following are excerpts from the speech given by Malayan representative Lin Lang at the Asian Women's Representative Conference today:

　　Malayan women, like women in many colonial countries in Asia, live a very dark and painful life. But Malaya is different from other colonies in that it is a colony composed of three major ethnic groups: Chinese, Malays, and Indians. It is an agricultural capitalist colony constituted by imperialist capital, Malay land, and Chinese and Indian labor. The nature of this colony determines the fate of our small-scale peasant economy's bankruptcy. The reproduction of offspring has also stagnated and slowed down.

　　You can go to the countryside of Malaya to investigate, and a Malayan farm family rarely has three children. Their women are often bare-backed and barefoot, and their children are mostly naked and unclothed. Their dwellings are no bigger than chicken coops. The Malay people number more than 1.4 million, but British imperialism has only left them less than 700,000 mu of land for cultivation, while taking 1.4 to 1.5 million mu of land for rubber plantations. The grain obtained by each Malay family can only last for four months of consumption, and the rest must be sold to the government at low prices. This chain tightly locks the livelihoods of the Malay people.

　　Especially the Chinese and Indian nationalities who plant rubber trees to make rubber sheets and work in tin mines in Malaya are subjected to excessive exploitation. One day's income is not enough to fill their stomachs. Therefore, Malayan workers' demand to be liberated from British colonial rule is even more urgent.

　　Precisely because of this, Malaya has become the most fiercely anti-imperialist struggle in Southeast Asia led by the working class in the past two decades. In the anti-imperialist struggle, our women are also very brave. In the War of Resistance Against Japan and the struggle against British imperialism, the prisons of Japanese fascists and British imperialism were filled with our female warriors.

　　After the war, Malayan women not only formed a women's federation with 100,000 members but also participated in the forefront of all struggles from the very beginning. In the struggle, we have also produced our own outstanding warriors. These are Comrade Ye Zhen, a leader of the people's masses who has persisted in the revolutionary struggle since 1941, Ying Minqin, a revolutionary intellectual who served as a representative of the Communist Party of North Malaya after the war, and Xie Ruisheng, who suffered gunshot wounds and prison hardships and is loved by the people. Now, the heroic sisters are rising up as bravely as they did during the Anti-Japanese War, fighting with their husbands and brothers in the mountains and forests and in the countryside against the imperialists.

　　We deeply know that in order to achieve the complete liberation of Malayan women, we must bravely shoulder the task of national independence and liberation of Malaya. We believe that as long as we closely unite the oppressed classes and sisters of all ethnic groups in Malaya, closely rely on the democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union internationally, and cooperate closely with sisters from Asian countries under the leadership of the International Women's Federation, and humbly learn from the Soviet Union and China, our work will surely be successful.

　　Now the victory of the Chinese revolution has illuminated our path forward, the great unity of Asian democratic women encourages us, and our victory is certain.

### 马来亚代表林朗发言

　　马来亚代表林朗发言
    【新华社北京十三日电】马来亚代表林朗今日在亚洲妇女代表会议上发言摘要如下：
    马来亚妇女和亚洲许多殖民地国家的妇女一样，过的是非常黑暗和痛苦的生活。但马来亚和其他殖民地不同，它是中国人、马来人和印度人三大民族构成的殖民地。它是以帝国主义的资本，马来人的土地，中国人和印度人的劳动力构成的农业资本主义化的殖民地。这一殖民地的性质就决定了我们小农经济破产的命运。子孙的繁殖也就停滞和缓慢了。
    你可以到马来亚的农村去考察，一个马来亚的农家是很少有三个孩子的。他们的妇女经常是光背赤足，他们的孩子大多赤裸裸的一丝不挂。他们的住屋不会比鸡笼更大。马来人民有一百四十多万，但英帝国主义仅仅留下不到七十万亩土地给他们耕种，而把一百四五十万亩土地拿来做树胶园。马来人每家所得的粮食，只能留下四个月的吃用，其余都得以低价卖给政府。这样一串链子紧紧锁住了马来人的＠子。
    特别是在马来亚种植橡胶树制造橡胶片的和在锡矿里工作的中印两民族，他们受着超度的剥削，一天的收入，不够一饱。因此马来亚工人要求从英国殖民地统治下解放出来，更是迫切。
    正因为如此，近二十年来马来亚也就成为东南亚以工人阶级为首的反帝斗争最激烈的地方。在反帝国主义斗争中，我们的妇女也是非常勇敢的。在抗日战争和反对英帝国主义的斗争中，在日本法西斯、英帝国主义的监牢里，都充满着我们的女战士。
    战后马来亚妇女不但组成了有十万会员的妇女联合会，而且一开始就参加到一切斗争的最前线。在斗争中我们也产生了自己的杰出的战士，这便是自一九四一年就坚持着革命斗争的人民群众领袖叶珍同志，战后担任过北马来亚共产党代表的革命知识分子应敏钦，以及受过枪伤和监牢的磨难的为人民热爱的谢瑞生。现在，英勇的姊妹们又和在抗日时期一样勇敢奋起，和丈夫、兄弟们一起在山林在农村同帝国主义者作战。
    我们深深知道要求得马来亚妇女的彻底解放，我们必须英勇地担负起马来民族独立解放的任务。我们相信只要在马来亚国内紧紧地团结各被压迫阶级以及各民族的姊妹，在国际上紧紧依靠以苏联为首的民主力量，在国际妇联领导下，和亚洲各国姊妹亲密合作，虚心向苏联和中国学习，我们的工作一定是有成绩的。
    现在中国革命胜利的光芒已照耀着我们前进的道路，亚洲民主妇女的大团结鼓舞着我们，我们的胜利是有把握的。
