During the third and fourth days of the meeting, group discussions were held. The representatives present were divided into twenty-three groups according to their respective units. In addition to discussing the above-mentioned work reports from the government, each group also discussed and reviewed the following cases: the plan to adjust winter housing rent, the interim measures for business tax collection, the measures for profit-making enterprise income tax collection, the organizational rules for the Labor-Management Dispute Arbitration Committee, the organizational regulations for the Factory Safety and Hygiene Committee, the temporary measures for private enterprises to hire temporary workers, the proposal to abolish the body search system, the resettlement of refugees and the winter relief plan, and the candidates for the Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee. The discussions in each group were very lively, and everyone felt that this meeting was better than the first one. Due to the group discussions, everyone had the opportunity to express their opinions. Each group also nominated a spokesperson to write down the group's opinions on paper and report to the general assembly, fully demonstrating the spirit of democracy and a serious and responsible attitude.

The fifth and sixth days of the meeting were for general assembly discussions, with a total of thirty-seven people speaking over the two days. Speakers unanimously expressed their support for the issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds. Worker representatives expressed their determination to compete for subscriptions; farmer representatives stated that they would purchase the People's Victory Indexed Bonds with the spirit of rushing to repair the sea dike; the industrial and commercial sectors stated that they would not lag behind; and the garrison troops stated that they would work harder to produce and use the proceeds to purchase bonds. The representatives unanimously agreed with the reports of Mayors Chen, Zeng, and Pan, believing that the government's disclosure of finances strengthened the people's sense of ownership, and that the government's difficulties were the people's difficulties, and the people must find ways to overcome them. At the same time, the representatives felt great satisfaction with the city treasury's balanced revenue and expenditure, and were full of hope for municipal construction. Regarding the winter relief plan, the representatives unanimously supported the Civil Affairs Bureau's proposed policy of accommodating, educating, and organizing refugees, and preparing for a large-scale resettlement back to their hometowns for production next year. The conference specifically organized a tax system committee to study the tax rules submitted by the Finance Bureau for review. The industrial and commercial sectors believed that the tax rates were completely reasonable and unanimously approved of the current self-declaration and payment system and the policy of light taxation and heavy penalties, but hoped that the starting point for taxation could be slightly lowered and the initial fines could be reduced. However, the latter opinion did not receive the support of the majority of people from other sectors. Regarding labor-management relations, everyone believed that there had been improvements, and many representatives provided moving materials proving that in the struggle against the blockade, many industrial and commercial enterprises were able to overcome difficulties due to the voluntary wage cuts and overtime work of their employees to help the employers. Both worker and industrial and commercial representatives believed that the signing of collective contracts was the best way to improve labor-management relations. The industrial and commercial representatives stated that they would explain and educate those few employers who did not yet understand. Regarding the Labor Bureau's proposal to abolish the factory's body search system for workers, all representatives except for a few industrial and commercial representatives unanimously expressed their support. A few industrial and commercial representatives expressed concern that factory property would not be protected after the abolition of the body search system; the worker representatives unanimously offered guarantees. Regarding the year-end bonus issue, the industrial and commercial representatives hoped to take into account the difficulties and not make rigid regulations. The worker representatives proposed: "The year-end bonus is part of the salary, and it is wrong for the employer to delay its payment; it is also wrong for the labor side to make excessive demands at present. We hope to negotiate based on specific circumstances. If the employer really has difficulties, they can talk sincerely, and a solution can always be found." The industrial and commercial sectors raised more concerns about difficulties such as poor capital turnover and production costs exceeding selling prices. Xu Dixing, a representative of the municipal government, pointed out: The causes of this difficulty, in addition to objective reasons, are subjectively due to the fact that many people in the industrial and commercial sectors do not understand the political situation. When prices fluctuate slightly, a few speculative merchants do not hesitate to borrow money at high interest rates to snap up raw materials, resulting in huge losses after prices stabilize. Chen Mu used specific figures to illustrate how the People's Bank of China is guiding idle funds to legitimate industry and commerce through various methods. The government has made efforts to solve the problem of funds, pointing out the bright future of legitimate industry and commerce. Many representatives at the meeting stated that speculative merchants should not be spared and hoped that the government would strictly crack down on them. After the general assembly discussion, the understanding of more than 600 representatives tended to be consistent. Many representatives felt that this meeting was very good and they had benefited a lot.

On the last day of the meeting, Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, who had just returned to Shanghai from Beijing, personally gave instructions. He conveyed the issues of the 1950 budget and the issuance of Victory Indexed Bonds decided by the Fourth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, further enhancing the confidence of all representatives in overcoming difficulties. Everyone more deeply realized the meaning of Chairman Mao's words "There are difficulties, there are methods, and there is hope." Then, Mayor Chen spoke, calling on the people of Shanghai to stand at their posts and actively respond to all measures of the Central People's Government with all possible efforts. The meeting received a total of one hundred and forty-two proposals. The proposals passed by the general assembly included: a telegram to the Central People's Government in support of the issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds, a telegram of condolences to the National People's Liberation Army, the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee, and the resettlement of refugees and the winter relief plan. The tax rules proposed by the aforementioned Finance Bureau, the proposals on labor-management issues proposed by the Labor Bureau, and the proposal to abolish the body search system were all approved in principle, and the parts that needed to be revised were all handed over to the Consultative Committee for specific discussion and revision. The meeting concluded victoriously after Zhang Yuanji delivered the closing speech.

　　各界代表一致表示认购公债决不后人
    会议第三、四日分组讨论。到会代表按单位分为二十三组。各组除讨论了以上政府的各项工作报告外，并讨论及审查了以下各案：调整冬季房捐方案、营业税稽征暂行办法、盈利事业所得税稽征办法、劳资争议仲裁委员会组织规则、工厂安全卫生委员会组织规程、私营企业雇用临时工暂时办法、废止抄身制度的建议、疏散难民和冬令救济方案以及上海市协商委员会的人选。各小组讨论都很热烈，大家认为这次会议比第一次开得更好。由于分组讨论，每个人都有发表意见的机会。各组并都推定发言人，将全组意见写在纸上，向大会报告，充分表现了民主精神和认真负责的态度。
    会议第五、六天为大会讨论，两天中发言的共三十七人。发言者对发行人民胜利折实公债一致表示拥护。工人代表表示决心争购；农民代表表示将以抢修海塘的精神，抢买人民胜利折实公债；工商界表示决不后人；警备部队表示将更加努力生产，以生产所得来购买公债。对陈、曾、潘正副市长的报告，代表们一致表示赞同，认为政府把财政公开，加强了人民主人翁观念，政府的困难就是人民的困难，人民一定要想办法克服。同时代表们对于市库收支平衡，感到莫大快慰，对市政建设充满了希望。关于冬令救济方案，代表们一致拥护民政局所提出的收容、教育、组织难民，准备明年大量疏散回乡生产的方针。财政局提请审查的税则，大会特组织税制委员会进行研究。工商界认为税率完全合理，一致赞成现行的自报实缴制度和轻课重罚政策，惟希望起征点略为降低和初锾从轻，但后一意见没有得到其他各界的多数人同意。关于劳资关系，大家都认为已经有了改善，不少代表提供了动人的材料，证明在反对封锁斗争中，许多工商业由于职工自动减薪、加工，协助资方渡过了难关。工人和工商界代表都认为订立集体合同是改善劳资关系的最好的办法，对少数尚不了解的资方，工商界代表表示将在同业中进行解释及教育。对劳动局提出废除工厂对工人的抄身制度，除个别工商界代表外，所有代表一致表示拥护。个别工商界代表表示怕废除抄身制后工厂的东西没有保障；工人代表当一致提出了保证。关于年奖问题，工商界代表希望照顾困难，不作硬性规定。工人代表提出：“年奖是工资的一部分，资方拖延不发是不对的；劳方如在目前提过高的要求也不对，希望根据具体情形双方协商，如资方实在有困难，诚诚恳恳地谈，总可以解决。”关于资金周转不灵，生产成本比售价高等的困难，工商界提得比较多。市政府代表许涤新指出：造成这一困难，除了客观原因外，主观上是由于工商界尚有不少人对政治形势不了解，物价稍有波动，少数投机商人即不惜以高利借款抢购原料，致物价稳定后遭受巨大损失；陈穆则以具体数字说明人民银行以种种办法引导游资走向正当工商业。政府在解决资金问题上所作的努力，指出了正当工商业的光明前途。会上许多代表表示投机商人不可饶恕，希望政府严加取缔。经过大会讨论，六百余位代表认识上趋于一致，许多代表认为这次会议开得很好，得益不少。
    会议最后一天，刚由北京返沪的华东军政委员会主席饶漱石亲临指示。他传达了中央人民政府委员会第四次会议所决定的一九五○年概算和发行胜利折实公债的问题，进一步提高了全体代表克服困难的信心。大家更深刻地体会到毛主席所说的“有困难的，有办法的，有希望的”这句话的意思。接着陈市长发言，号召上海人民站在自己的岗位上，尽一切可能的力量积极响应中央人民政府的一切措施。会议共收到提案一百四十二件。经大会通过的有：拥护发行人民胜利折实公债致中央人民政府电，致电慰问全国人民解放军，成立上海市协商委员会，疏散难民和冬令救济方案等。关于上述财政局所提的税则和劳动局所提的劳资问题的提案及废止抄身制度的建议，都原则通过，需要修改的地部分均交协商委员会具体讨论修改。会议最后由张元济致闭幕词后胜利闭幕。
