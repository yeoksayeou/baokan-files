　　Hoping to Eradicate Smallpox Nationwide Within Ten Years
　　Liu @ Xiang
　　Some say that smallpox originated in our country. Whether or not that is true, it is undeniable that smallpox has existed for a long time and been widespread in our country. There is no specific cure for smallpox. Once infected, there is no remedy other than general care. In the past, countless people died from smallpox every year, and those who survived were often left with disabilities. Smallpox is indeed a major enemy of the people's health. In the past, the Kuomintang's health authorities never effectively, nor were able to effectively, deal with it. Now, the People's Government Ministry of Health has just been established and is determined to eradicate smallpox, which has plagued us for thousands of years, within ten years. This is a major event of historical significance, and it also proves that the People's Government is truly responsible to the people. We medical workers should resolutely support this decision and strive for its realization.
　　Eradicating smallpox is entirely possible from a medical point of view. Although there is no specific treatment for smallpox, there is a specific preventive method that is not only reliable but also simple—vaccination.
　　The effectiveness of vaccination in preventing smallpox is beyond dispute. There are many facts to prove this, and medical books contain numerous records. Let's just study one typical example: Vaccination was only introduced to Sweden in 1801 and became widespread by 1810. Compulsory vaccination became law in 1816. The following statistics show that the effect of vaccination was significant:
Period 　　Number of deaths from smallpox per million people
1774–1801 (27 years)　 2,050
1801–1810 (9 years)　　680
1810–1855 (45 years)　 169

　　If we can implement universal vaccination nationwide, ensuring that everyone is vaccinated, smallpox will disappear. This is because the smallpox virus (technically called a filterable virus) can only exist in smallpox patients. If everyone is vaccinated and does not get smallpox, then the smallpox virus will have no way to continue to exist. After that, we only need to enforce quarantine measures to ensure that no smallpox is imported. Therefore, we are confident that it is entirely possible to eradicate smallpox within ten years.
　　Vaccination sounds simple, but if not done well, it may not achieve the expected results. Here are a few points to note:
　　(1) Nature of the vaccine: Generally, the vaccine is made by scraping the pustules from a patient's smallpox rash and inoculating them onto the skin of animals to induce pox. Usually, monkeys are used first, then rabbits, and finally cattle. After the pustules develop well, they are scraped off, ground into a slurry with carbolic acid and glycerol water, and then diluted to a certain concentration to become the vaccine. It is usually packaged in capillary tubes. When used, the tube is broken and the vaccine liquid is taken out. The reason why inoculation can cause pox is because the vaccine contains a sufficient amount of cowpox virus. This virus is easily killed. If the vaccine is not stored well, is exposed to heat, or is exposed to sunlight, or is stored for too long beyond its expiration date, most or all of the virus will die, and it will lose its effectiveness. Vaccination will fail. The vaccine must be stored in a cool, dark place, preferably in a refrigerator at 2 to 10 degrees Celsius. The expiration date is usually three months. Dried vaccine can be stored for a longer time and is less sensitive to heat, but because it is more difficult to manufacture and more expensive. At the same time, cowpox vaccine is made from pustules scraped from the skin of cattle, and it is difficult to ensure that it contains only pure cowpox virus. It will more or less contain some bacteria. If the bacteria content is not too high and does not cause disease, there is no harm; otherwise, it can be very dangerous, and inoculation can cause serious consequences. Therefore, special attention must be paid during manufacturing and inspection to ensure that it meets standards. The number of bacteria in each cubic centimeter of vaccine should not exceed 2,000, and pathogenic bacteria such as tetanus bacilli and pyogenic bacteria must absolutely not be present.
　　(2) Vaccination method: The most commonly used methods are the puncture method and the scratch method. For the puncture method, a needle tip parallel to the skin surface is used to quickly press the area where the vaccine has been dripped twenty or thirty times. Do not break the skin, just press the vaccine into the deep layer of the epidermis. The vaccination area should not exceed 0.3 cm in diameter. An economical method is to squeeze the vaccine onto a sterilized dish and use a needle tip dipped in it to inoculate the skin. For the scratch method, a needle or small pointed knife is used to scratch the skin where the vaccine has been dripped. Do not scratch too deeply to the point of bleeding, only some serum should seep out, and then the vaccine is rubbed into the scratch with a needle. The scratch should not be too large, about 0.3 cm. Whether using the puncture or scratch method, one inoculation is usually sufficient, but one or two more should be done in any of the following situations: ① those who have been vaccinated once without a reaction; ② those who have been in contact with smallpox patients; ③ those who cannot return for follow-up after vaccination. If vaccinating more than once, there should be a gap of at least 2.5 cm between each inoculation. In addition, some people advocate intradermal injection, believing that it is more effective, but it is not widespread, and ordinary vaccines contain bacteria to some extent, which can easily cause suppuration when injected intradermally. Using sterile egg vaccine can avoid this, but egg vaccine is also not widespread.
　　Attention should be paid to disinfection during vaccination. The vaccine capillary tube should be wiped clean with 70% alcohol before being broken open for use. The needles or small knives used for vaccination should be boiled or sterilized with flame. The skin at the vaccination site should first be washed with soap and then disinfected with 70% alcohol. After vaccination, it is not advisable to bandage. If it is absolutely necessary to prevent contamination of clothing, a thin layer of gauze can be used to cover it. Bandaging too thickly will instead make it easier for bacteria, especially anaerobic bacteria, to multiply. If the bandage used is not clean, it will cause adverse consequences. It is best to take a bath and change into soft, clean underwear before vaccination, and do not bandage after vaccination. The upper third of the outer side of the upper arm is the best site for vaccination. Some people are afraid of scars and want to be vaccinated on the thighs, which is not good because the legs are easily contaminated. Having a vaccination scar does not actually affect beauty.
　　(3) Checking the results after vaccination: It is not enough to just vaccinate without asking about the results. Because if the vaccine used is not good or the surgery is not good, it may not work even if it is vaccinated. There is a common concept that the lack of reaction after vaccination is a sign of immunity, which is wrong. There should be a reaction regardless of whether there is immunity or not, but the type of reaction is different. If there is no reaction at all, it means that the vaccination was not done well and must be re-vaccinated until there is a reaction. There are several types of reactions to vaccination: ① Normal reaction: This reaction should occur in those who are vaccinated for the first time or have been vaccinated but have been vaccinated for too long and their immunity has completely disappeared. Three to five days after vaccination, papules appear at the vaccination site. The papules gradually become herpes, developing to their peak on the eighth to tenth days and then slowly scabbing and fading away. The whole process takes about fourteen or fifteen days. ② Accelerated reaction: This reaction occurs in those who have had smallpox or have been vaccinated and still have some immunity. The process of pox development is the same as in the first category, but the process is accelerated. Papules are found on the third or fourth day, turning into herpes within a day or two, reaching their peak on the sixth or seventh day, and fading quickly. The whole process takes only about ten days. ③ Immune reaction: This type of reaction occurs in those who have had smallpox or have been vaccinated and still have a high degree of immunity. Papules and redness occur within two days, quickly fading without forming herpes. If vaccination is successful, there must be the above reactions, only the degree of severity is different. Therefore, a results check should be done after vaccination. For the first vaccination, the check should be done on the tenth to fifteenth day; for repeat vaccination, the check should be done on the second to fourth day. Those who have not been vaccinated well should be re-vaccinated to ensure the effectiveness of the vaccination.
　　(4) How often to vaccinate? How long immunity can be maintained after one vaccination is not very consistent, but generally speaking, it can be maintained for ten or eight years. It is best to repeat the vaccination every six or seven years if possible. If smallpox is epidemic or before going to an epidemic area, another vaccination should be done regardless of when the last one was given. Some people advocate vaccinating every year, which is not necessary.

　　希望在十年内全国消灭天花
    刘＠湘
    有人说天花发源于我国，不管是不是，天花在我国存在之久与流行之广是无可讳言的。天花没有特效疗法，得了病除一般护理外毫无办法。过去每年死于天花的不知有多少人，幸而不死的也多落了残疾。天花确是人民健康的一大公敌。过去国民党的卫生当局始终没有有效的也不会有效的来对付它。现在人民政府卫生部刚刚成立，便下决心要在十年内消灭为害了千百年的天花。这是一件有历史意义的大事，也证明人民政府确是对人民负责的。我们医务工作者应当坚决拥护这一决定并为其实现而奋斗。
    消灭天花在医学观点上是完全可能的。天花虽然没有特效的治疗法，却有特效的预防法，这方法不但可靠，而且简单——就是种牛痘。
    种痘对于预防天花的效力，已经是不容争辩的了。有很多事实可以证明，医学书籍上有大量的记载。我们只学一个典型的例子：瑞曲从一八○一年才有人种牛痘，到一八一○年已经普及，自一八一六年强迫种痘成为法律，下面的统计表明种痘的效果是很大的：时期　　每百万人中死于天花之数一七七四—一八○一（二十七年）　 二千○五十一八○一—一八一○（九年）　　六百八十一八一○—一八五五（四十五年）　 一百六十九
    如果我们能在全国范围普遍种痘，做到人人种痘，天花便会绝迹。因为天花病毒（术语叫作滤过性毒）只能存在于天花病人身上，如果人人都种了痘不会生天花，则天花病毒便无法继续存在。以后我们只须励行检疫，保证没有天花传入就行了。所以我们有信心在十年内消灭天花是完全可能的。
    种痘说来简单，但作得不好，也会得不到预期的效果。这里有几点必须注意：
    （一）牛痘苗的性质：牛痘苗一般是捋下病人的痘疱，种在动物皮肤上使之发痘。普通先用猴子，由猴子再种家兔，最后种到牛身上。待痘疱发育良好捋下来，加石炭酸、甘油水研磨成浆，再稀释到一定的浓度便成痘苗。普通装在毛细管内，用时折断取出痘浆。种了所以能发痘，是因为痘苗内含有足量的牛痘病毒。这种毒很容易死，痘苗保存得不好，受了热，晒了太阳或放得太久，过了有效期，痘毒便会大部或全部死去，就失去作用，种了不出。痘苗必须储藏在冷暗处，最好是摄氏二至十度的冰箱内，有效期普通是三个月。干燥痘苗可以保存得久，比较起来不怕热，但因制造起来比较繁难，价钱要大得多。同时牛痘苗是则牛皮肤上捋下的痘疱制成，很难作到只含有单纯的牛痘毒，而会或多或少的含些细菌，所含细菌如果不太多，不致于病，则没有妨碍；否则便很危险，种了可以引起严重的后果。所以必须在制造和检查时特别注意，必须合乎标准。而每公撮痘苗内含菌数不得超过二千，致病的细菌如破伤风杆菌、化脓性菌等更是绝对不能有的。
    （二）种痘方法：最常用的是点种法与划痕法，点种法是用与皮肤表面平行的针尖在皮上滴有痘苗的部位，很快的用力压二三十次，。不要刺破皮肤，只要将痘苗压入上皮的深层就行了。种痘面积不宜超过０．３公分直径。一个最经济的办法是将痘苗挤在消毒器皿上用针尖蘸了点种到皮肤上。划痕法是用针或小尖刀在滴有痘苗的皮肤上划痕，不要太深以致出血，只应有些血清渗出，然后把痘苗用针擦入痕内。划痕不可太大，以０．３公分左右为度。无论点种或划痕普通种一颗已足，但有下列情形之一者应多种一两颗：①曾经种过一次未发痘者；②曾与天花病人接触者；③种好之后不能再回来检视结果者。如果种两颗以上，每颗之间应间隔最少２．５公分。另外有人主张用皮内注射，认为效果更好，但不普遍，而且普通痘苗总多少含有细菌，注射皮内易引起化脓。用无菌的鸡蛋痘苗可以避免，可是鸡蛋痘苗也不普遍。
    种痘时应注意消毒，痘苗毛细管应先用７０％酒精擦净再折开用，种痘用的针或小刀都应煮沸或用炎焰消毒。种痘部位的皮肤应先用肥皂洗净及７０％酒精消毒。种痘以后不宜包札，如果十分必要怕染污了衣服可用一层薄薄的纱布盖上，包札太厚到反使细菌尤其是压气菌容易繁殖，如包扎用布不清洁则更会引起不良后果。最好是在种痘之前洗个澡换上柔软清洁的内衣，种痘以后不要包札。种痘部位以上臂外侧之上三分之一为宜，有人怕落疤痕而愿意种在大腿上是不好的，因为腿上容易染污，有个痘疤其实也并不会妨碍美观。
    （三）种痘后检查结果：只管种痘不问结果是不够的。因为如果用的痘苗不好或种时手术不好都可以种了不发生作用。一般有一个观念，认为种了没有反应便是有免疫力的表现是错误的，无论有无免疫力都应当有反应，不过反应的种类不同。如果毫无反应是种痘没种好，必须重新种，直到有了反应为止。种痘的反应有下列几种：①正常的反应：第一次种痘者或种过痘但隔的时间太久，免疫力已完全消失者应呈此种反应。种后三到五天种痘处出现丘疹，丘疹渐成疱疹，第八至十天发展到最高峰以后慢慢结疤而至消褪，全部过程约十四五天。②加速反应：曾生过天花或种过痘还有一部分免疫力者呈此种反应。发痘的过程与第一类同，但过程加速，丘疹在第三四天发现，一两天内变成疱疹，至第六七天达最高峰，以及很快消褪，全过程约只十天。③免疫反应：曾生天花或种痘尚有高度免疫力者呈此类反应。在两天内发生丘疹红肿，很快消褪不形成疱疹。如果种痘成功必得有以上的反应，只是轻重程度不同而已。所以种后应作结果检查，初次种痘的，应在第十至十五天检查，重复种痘的在第二至四天检查，没有种好的应当重种，才可以保证种痘的效果。
    （四）多少时间种痘一次？种一次免疫力可以维持多久，说法还不太一致，一般说来可以维持十年八年。如果能够每六七年重复种痘一次是最好的。如果遇到天花流行或到流行区去前不管上一次何时种的也应再种一次。有人主张每年种一次是不需要的。
