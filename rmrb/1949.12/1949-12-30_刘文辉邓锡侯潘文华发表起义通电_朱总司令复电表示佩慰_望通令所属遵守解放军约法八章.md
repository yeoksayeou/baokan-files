Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th: General Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Pan Wenhua and others issued a telegram announcing their uprising on the 9th of this month. The text of the telegram is as follows: Respectfully to Chairman Mao in Beijing, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and forwarded to the Commanders of all Field Armies and the people of the whole country:

Jiang Jieshi, the bandit, has stolen the power of the state for twenty years, and his crimes are obvious and recognized by all Chinese people. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, his measures have become increasingly perverse, such as destroying the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, launching an unprecedented domestic war, disrupting finance and economy, promoting the bankruptcy of the national economy, instigating corrupt officials to run rampant, making our country a laughing stock to its neighbors, and reducing our international standing. All kinds of crimes have intensified, only to see the vitality of the people wither and the national spirit be completely cut off. Jiang, the bandit, clinging to his evil ways, only seeks personal gain. In this day of low morale among soldiers and popular discontent, he still wants to resist the whole country with one corner, and use the lives and properties left in Sichuan and Kangding provinces after eight years of the Anti-Japanese War as a desperate gamble. How can the people of our two provinces endure this forever? Wenhui, Xihou, and Wenhua, in the past few years, although we have failed to unite the military and the people in time to cooperate with the People's Liberation War, it is never too late to mend. The past was wrong and the present is right, which is understood by wise men. Now, in order to meet the demands of the people, we have decided to lead our subordinates from this moment on to sever relations with the Jiang, Li, Bai, and Yan reactionary clique, and wholeheartedly obey the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng of the Second Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We hope that all military and political personnel in Sichuan and Kangding will be loyal to their duties, protect social order and public and private property, and await the takeover by the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government, and strive to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, so as to liberate the entire territory of Sichuan and Kangding as soon as possible. We express our sincere words and respectfully request your consideration.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th: Commander-in-Chief Zhu De replied to General Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Pan Wenhua and others on the 24th of this month. The text of the telegram is as follows:

General Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Pan Wenhua, honored sirs:

Having read your telegram of December 9th, I am delighted to learn that you have broken away from the Kuomintang reactionary group and joined the people's camp. I am very pleased and comforted. I hope you will order your subordinates to abide by the Eight Chapters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Headquarters on April 25th of this year and the Four Pledges of the Second Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on November 21st of this year, improve the relationship between the military and the people and the relationship between officers and soldiers, and strive to assist the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government to eliminate the remaining reactionaries and establish a revolutionary order.

    蒋贼介石盗窃国柄，二十载于兹，罪恶昭彰，国人共见。自抗战胜利而还，措施益形乖谬，如破坏政协决议各案，发动空前国内战争，紊乱金融财政，促成国民经济破产，嗾使贪污佥壬横行，贻笑邻邦，降低国际地位，种种罪行，变本加厉，徒见国民生机枯萎，国家元气斩绝。而蒋贼怙恶不悛，唯私是图。在士无斗志，人尽离心的今天，尚欲以一隅抗天下，把川康两省八年抗战所残留的生命财产，作孤注之一掷。我两省民众，岂能忍与终古。文辉、锡侯、文华等于过去数年间，虽未能扩时团结军民，配合人民解放战争，然亡羊补牢，古有明训，昨非今是，贤者所谅。兹为适应人民要求，决自即日起率领所属，宣布与蒋李白阎反动集团断绝关系，竭诚服从中央人民政府毛主席、朱总司令与中国人民解放军第二野战军刘司令员、邓政治委员之领导。所望川康全体军政人员，一律尽忠职守，保护社会秩序与公私财物，听候人民解放军与人民政府之接收，并努力配合人民解放军消灭国民党反动派之残余，以期川康全境早获解放。坦白陈词，敬维垂察。
