    Section 4: The Revolutionary, Combative, and Practical Nature of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy; The Bourgeois Advocacy of Separating Theory from Practice

    The bourgeoisie and their defenders and agents of economic interests advocate the separation of theory from practice. They believe that theory and practice can not only be separated but should be separated. When the bourgeoisie opposed feudalism, they advocated freedom of speech, but once they seized power and became the ruling class, they restricted, restrained, and suppressed the speech and theories of the proletariat and the masses. Later, with the development of the proletarian movement, the bourgeoisie further intensified their restrictions, restraints, and suppression of proletarian theories. The motive, starting point, and ultimate goal of their actions are nothing more than fearing the truth and practicality of proletarian theory and proletarian political economy, in order to suppress the awakening and actions of the proletariat and the masses, and to protect the interests of the bourgeoisie and their exploitative rule.

    However, the bourgeoisie's restrictions, restraints, and even high-pressure tactics ultimately cannot restrict, restrain, or suppress the spread of Marxist-Leninist political economy. Therefore, once Marxist-Leninist political economy began to spread, the bourgeoisie and their spokespersons advocated that theory and practice should be separated and could be separated. In the beginning, they said that Marx's theory was an ideal and not something that could be implemented. They listed many so-called reasons why it could not be implemented, such as: humans are selfish animals, and socialism and communism are collectivist, so they won't work. They also said that production must have capital, and if there is capital, there must be capitalists, and if there are capitalists, socialism cannot be implemented. Later, after the October Socialist Revolution in Russia, the Soviet Union carried out socialist economic construction. Factories no longer had capitalists, and rural areas no longer had rich peasants. Production continued as usual and even better. Then, the bourgeoisie and their spokespersons—bourgeois political economists—changed their tune and clamored loudly. Apart from all kinds of rumors, slanders, and libels, they either said that this was a special situation in Russia and that socialism would not work in other countries, or they said that socialism in Russia had failed and gone bankrupt, that what was being implemented was state capitalism, or that socialism in Russia would not work, had failed, and had returned to the road of capitalism, and so on. However, after World War II, many New Democratic countries were established in the East and Eastern Europe, and the New Democratic countries in Eastern Europe gradually began to enter socialist construction; in the New Democratic economies in the East, there were also socialist and semi-socialist economic components; therefore, the argument that communism would not work in other countries or was not suitable for China's national conditions had to be buried in the grave along with the demise of the bourgeois reactionary rule.

    The bourgeoisie fear the combination of proletarian theories and practice. They artificially isolate theory from practice. This approach can be said to be typical of the Japanese bourgeoisie's ruling methods. After World War I, Marxism was widely disseminated in Japan. The Japanese rulers did not dare to tear off their "freedom of speech" mask at the time, so they still allowed its publication and allowed the proletariat and progressive intellectuals to read it. However, they adopted clever methods to delete words and phrases in economics that they considered harmful to the bourgeoisie, such as revolution, communism, crisis, panic, strike, and sabotage, and replaced them with ××, ××. At the same time, they announced that they were only allowed to read and not allowed to act. In this way, they used the privileges of law and the police to forcibly separate the theory and practice of proletarian political economy, fearing the awakening of the proletariat and the masses and their revolutionary actions. Later, as the proletarian revolutionary movement in Japan flourished, the bourgeoisie felt threatened to their rule. Therefore, they completely tore off the so-called bourgeois democratic freedom of speech mask and adopted fascist suppression, banning the publication of all progressive newspapers and magazines, banning all Marxist-Leninist works and the publication and dissemination of Marxist-Leninist political economy books, and arresting and killing all revolutionary and progressive intellectuals and workers, creating a fascist bloody reign of terror, trying to suppress and eliminate proletarian culture in this way. As for the rule and oppression of the Chinese big landlords and big bourgeoisie, it was even a culmination of the imperialist fascist and Chinese feudalist ruling and oppressive methods, and completely adopted the extremely barbaric and brutal fascist despotism of banning, annihilating, and massacring the dissemination of Chinese Marxist-Leninist theories and Chinese Marxist-Leninists.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（６３）
  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第四节马列主义政治经济学的革命性、战斗性与实践性资产阶级主张理论与实践分离
    资产阶级及其经济利益的辩护者代理人，提倡理论与实践分离，他们认为理论与实践不但可以分离，而且应该分离。资产阶级当它反对封建主义时，主张言论自由，但它一旦夺取掌握政权自己成为统治阶级的时候，对于无产阶级与人民大众的言论学说就加以限制加以束缚加以抑压，以后随着无产阶级运动的发展，资产阶级对无产阶级学说的限制束缚抑压也更加加甚。他们所以这样做法，其动机出发点以及最后目的，都无非是因为害怕无产阶级理论无产阶级政治经济学的真理性和实践性，为了要压制无产阶级和人民大众的觉醒与行动，为了保护资产阶级的利益和它们的剥削统治。
    但资产阶级的限制束缚以至于高压，终究限制束缚抑压不住马列主义政治经济学的传播。故当马列主义政治经济学一经传播，资产阶级及其代言人，便主张理论与实践应该分离，并且是可以分离的。他们在开始的时候说什么马克思的学说是理想，而不是什么能够实行的东西，他们并列举很多所谓不能实行的理由，譬如他们说：人是自私自利的动物，社会主义与共产主义是集体主义，所以行不通。他们又说什么生产必须要有资本，既要有资本，就必须要有资本家，要有资本家，也就不能实行社会主义。以后经过俄国十月社会主义革命，苏联进行了社会主义的经济建设，工厂没有了资本家，农村没有了富农，生产都照样进行，并且进行的更好，于是资产阶级其代言人——资产阶级政治经济学者，又改变腔调大肆叫嚣起来，除去一切造谣诬蔑诽谤中伤以外，他们不是说这是俄国的特殊国情，在别国内社会主义是行不通的。便是说俄国社会主义失败了破产了，实行的是什么国家资本主义，或者又说俄国社会主义行不通，失败了又回复到了资本主义的道路等等。但是第二次世界大战以后，东方与东欧建立了许多新民主主义国家，并且东欧各新民主国家都逐步开始进入社会主义建设；在东方新民主主义经济里，也都具有社会主义半社会主义成份的经济；因此共产主义在别国行不通或者不适合于中国国情的论调，也就不得不随着资产阶级反动统治的灭亡，而葬入坟墓。
    资产阶级害怕无产阶级学说理论与实践的结合，他们把理论与实践人为地隔离起来，这一种做法，日本资产阶级统治的办法可以说是典型的。当世界第一次大战后，马克思主义在日本得到广泛的传布，日本统治者当时不敢撕下它“言论自由”的假面具，因此还允许它的出版，并允许无产阶级与进步的知识分子阅读，可是它采取巧妙的办法，把凡是他认为对资产阶级有害的比较激烈的经济学中的字眼词句如革命、共产、危机、恐慌、罢工、怠工等等字眼文句都予以删削，代之以××，××，同时宣布只许阅读，不准行动。他们就是这样利用法律与警察的特权把无产阶级政治经济学的理论与实践强制地分割起来，害怕无产阶级及人民大众的觉醒与他们革命的行动。迩后日本无产阶级革命运动蓬勃发展，资产阶级感到对它统治威胁，于是他们就完全撕破了所谓资产阶级民主言论自由的假面具，采取了法西斯的镇压，禁没一切进步书报杂志的发行，禁没一切马列主义的著作与马列主义政治经济学书籍的出版传布，捕杀一切革命的进步的知识分子与工人。造成了法西斯的血腥恐怖统治，想这样来镇压消灭无产阶级文化。至于中国大地主大资产阶级的统治压迫，更是集帝国主义法西斯主义与中国封建主义统治压迫办法的大成，对中国马列主义学说的传播与中国马列主义者，完全采取了禁没虐杀极端野蛮残暴的法西斯专制主义的办法。
