　　Pravda on the Asian Women's Congress
    It summarized the preliminary achievements of women in various countries who have broken free from colonial enslavement or are completing their liberation struggles.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th] TASS Moscow, 26th: Pravda commented today on the significance of the Asian Women's Representatives Conference recently concluded in Beijing, stating: The convening of this conference is the result of the large-scale national liberation movement carried out by the people of Eastern countries, and first and foremost the result of the epoch-making victory of the great Chinese people. The slogan of this conference is to unite hundreds of millions of women in the East to fight for peace and democracy and against imperialist enslavers and war-mongers.

    Pravda elaborated in detail on the speeches of several representatives at the conference. They recounted the appalling and cruel exploitation suffered by women and children in various countries still under the yoke of imperialism. Working women in colonial countries work ten to twelve hours and only receive half the wages of male workers. Hundreds of thousands of women die in childbirth. Due to the extremely dire living conditions, one-fourth of Indian infants die before they reach the age of one. The infant mortality rate in Indonesia reaches 40 percent. But neither cruel suppression nor economic oppression can thwart the will of the oppressed people to fight. Their belief that they will soon be liberated from the suppression of the colonizers is growing stronger day by day.

    The Asian Women's Representatives Conference summarized the preliminary achievements of women in various countries who have broken free from colonial enslavement or are completing their liberation struggles. Following the path paved by the Soviet Union, the people of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Democratic Vietnam have achieved considerable success in liberating women. In these countries, women have obtained full social status, participate in national administration, and play an active role in industry. The conference in Beijing also vividly demonstrated the support of progressive women in imperialist countries for their sisters in the East who are fighting for freedom and independence. Representatives of democratic women in imperialist countries, in their speeches, exposed the criminal policies of the ruling groups, introduced their struggles to end colonial wars, and how they oppose the bloody plans of American and British imperialists who want to push mankind into another war.

　　真理报论亚洲妇代会
    她总结了已经挣脱殖民奴役或正在完成她们解放斗争的各国妇女们的初步成就。
    【新华社北京二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：真理报今日评论新近在北京闭幕的亚洲妇女代表会议的意义称：这次大会的能够召开，是东方各国人民所进行的巨大规模的民族解放运动的结果，而首先是伟大中国人民划时代胜利的结果。这次大会的口号是团结东方亿万妇女群众，为争取和平民主，反对帝国主义奴役者和战争贩子而斗争。
    真理报详细阐述在这次大会上若干代表的演说。她们陈诉了现仍在帝国主义枷锁下的各国妇女与儿童所受惊人的残酷剥削。殖民地国家的劳动妇女工作十至十二小时，只得到男工一半的工资。数十万妇女死于产褥。由于生活境况十分凄惨，印度婴儿有四分之一活不了一年就夭折。印尼儿童死亡率达百分之四十。但不管是残酷镇压或是经济压迫，都不能挫折被压迫人民斗争的意志。他们不久即将自殖民者镇压下获得解放的信念，一天比一天强固。
    亚洲妇女代表会议总结了已经挣脱殖民地奴役或正在完成他们解放斗争的各国妇女们的初步成就。照着苏联所铺平了的道路，中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国民主越南的人民，在解放妇女方面已得到颇大成功。在这些国家里，妇女得到完全的社会地位，她们参加国家行政，并在工业中起积极的作用。北京的大会也生动地表明了帝国主义国家进步妇女对东方为自由独立而奋斗的姊妹们的支持。帝国主义国家民主妇女的代表们，在她们的演说里揭露了统治集团的罪恶政策，介绍她们为终止殖民地战争所进行的斗争、以及她们如何反对想把人类推入另一次战争中的美英帝国主义者的血腥计划。
