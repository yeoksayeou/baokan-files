　　Mobilize to Purchase Public Bonds
    He Li
    After the fourth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee passed the "Decision on Issuing People's Victory Commodity Bonds" on the fourth of this month, followed by the eleventh government affairs meeting of the Government Administration Council on the sixteenth, which passed the "Regulations on the First Phase of the 1950 People's Victory Commodity Bonds," it was decided to start issuing the bonds from January 5th of next year. The bonds will be in four denominations: one share, ten shares, one hundred shares, and five hundred shares, with an annual interest rate of five percent, to be repaid in installments over five years, and specific commodity conversion methods are specified. The issuance of these bonds is to make up for next year's fiscal deficit, reduce currency issuance, and avoid inflation. It is entirely in line with the interests of all the people and is the most effective measure to stabilize prices and ensure people's livelihood. Therefore, as soon as the bonds were announced, they were immediately supported by people from all walks of life across the country. Everyone especially remembers Chairman Mao's insightful saying: "Our situation can be summarized as: there are difficulties, there are solutions, and there is hope." His words have given us endless strength and guided us to an infinitely bright future. As many industrialists said: "Public bonds can stabilize prices, which will encourage people to invest in construction." Currently, all parts of the country are beginning to mobilize and work hard to complete this public bond issuance.
    However, the development of anything is not without difficulties. The realization of the public bond issuance requires the people, especially wealthy households holding idle capital, to take out money to solve the state's fiscal expenditure. China was originally an economically backward country, and after a long period of enemy and puppet devastation, its financial and material resources are far inferior to those before the war. Therefore, some people reflect: everyone expresses approval for this public bond issuance, but everyone in the business community says there are difficulties. Therefore, some people in the business community put forward some opinions. Some demanded "hope that the bonds can be liquid, and that when they are in financial difficulties, the bank can provide mortgage loans." Some proposed that "this public bond issuance should be universal, reaching every corner, with everyone purchasing and sharing the burden equally." Others proposed "hope to use goods to offset the payment for purchasing public bonds." Some even "hope to exchange gold and silver for public bonds." From these conversations, it is clear that there are various opinions on this public bond issuance within the business community.
    Obviously, this public bond issuance has revealed a contradictory mood among certain individuals, especially in the business community. On the one hand, they demand stable prices, while on the other hand, they are unwilling to take out their own money to deposit it with the state for several years. What should be done? There are only two paths: one is to endure temporary small difficulties to solve the state's major difficulties. If this is done, the state's fiscal deficit will be resolved, inflation will not occur, and they will also be spared from the difficulties of future price fluctuations. The other path is to only care about personal temporary interests, not take out idle capital to purchase public bonds, allowing the state's finances to continue to be difficult, allowing prices to continue to fluctuate, and making their production enterprises "live from hand to mouth" in the long term (as one industrialist put it). Which of these two paths should be chosen? Of course, it should be the former rather than the latter.
    A person should have foresight and should not haggle over narrow, temporary interests, so as not to "lose the big picture for the small."
    Public bonds cannot circulate on the market. If public bonds can circulate on the market, it is tantamount to a disguised form of currency issuance. The result will not be to recover currency and allow money to return to the market, but rather to increase currency inflation. What is even more terrible is that it will create opportunities for certain speculative merchants to profit, just like the stock exchanges during the Kuomintang bandit regime, which became places for speculation and manipulation, seriously harming the country and the people. The People's Government has learned from past experiences and specifically stipulated in this public bond regulation: "It must not replace currency in circulation on the market, it must not be mortgaged to state banks, and it must not be used for speculative trading." This regulation is extremely important. Without this, the effect of truly stabilizing prices cannot be achieved. The entire country must strictly abide by it.
    Related to this issue, some capitalists in Shanghai have requested the issuance of gold treasury bonds to replace public bonds. Because after liberation, our gold and silver were frozen, and their speculative capital (gold and silver) could no longer be active in the market. Therefore, they hope to issue gold treasury bonds, hand over their gold and silver to the government for safekeeping, and turn it into working capital, so that they can continue to speculate in the market. This opens the door wide for speculative merchants holding gold and silver, allowing them to do whatever they want. But for the government, this not only does not contract the currency in the market, but on the contrary turns frozen gold and silver into circulating funds, adding to market speculation, which is the opposite of the meaning of our issuing public bonds. This is for themselves, for speculative merchants; not for the country, for the people. The broad masses of the people, and even legitimate industrialists and businessmen, oppose this selfish demand.
    Public bonds cannot be replaced with goods either. Of course, certain goods that are beneficial to national construction, such as delivering export goods to the state, which the state uses to obtain foreign exchange, are also beneficial. But generally speaking, goods cannot be used as substitutes, because one of the purposes of this public bond issuance is to tighten the money supply, stabilize prices, and coordinate with next year's financial work in the state bank's overdraft, that is, the issuance of currency, to avoid inflation. If everyone hands over goods, it will inevitably lead to certain goods being stockpiled in the state's hands and unable to be sold, and conversely, currency cannot be recovered, and the phenomenon of inflation cannot be avoided.
    The idea of "equal burden" is also inappropriate. Yes, the people of the whole country have the obligation to purchase public bonds. This public bond regulation also stipulates methods of burden suitable for people of all strata. Those who have less can purchase one share or ten shares, and those who have more can purchase hundreds or thousands of shares. There is no doubt that many working people with very weak purchasing power will also tighten their belts, save money, and subscribe to public bonds. However, we should recognize that we cannot use an equal method to persuade people to purchase. Today, everyone knows that the lives of farmers are the hardest. As Mr. Chen Yintang of Dahua Kiln Company said: "No matter how heavy the burden in the city, it is better than in the countryside." Farmers have supported the long liberation war with their hard work, manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Even today, their tax burden is still the heaviest, and the tax burden in the cities is lighter. If today the business community does not demand equality in burden, but only demands equality in subscribing to public bonds, that is untenable. Workers and other salaried people will naturally also do their best to take out money to purchase public bonds, but these people after all have meager incomes and have family burdens, and it is impossible to take out a lot of money to purchase; therefore, this public bond issuance must mainly rely on the urban business community, especially those holding idle capital.
    Of course, there are also differences among these people. The issuance of these public bonds is mainly to absorb idle capital in society for production and construction, so that idle capital can find a legitimate outlet, otherwise allowing it to roam in society will inevitably lead to speculation and disruption of finance. Today, China's industry is developing, and there is less idle capital, so we should do our best to subscribe under the principle of not hindering production. However, commercial idle capital is more abundant, and profits are also better than industry, so we should purchase more. In particular, those who specialize in hoarding or financial speculation, as well as wealthy households holding gold, silver, and US dollars, should invest a large amount of their idle capital in public bonds. The People's Victory Commodity Bonds are converted into real objects and have interest, which is more beneficial than hoarding, and purchasing public bonds to solve the state's financial difficulties is also a contribution to society. This is truly a good thing that brings both fame and fortune.
    Now all parties are mobilizing, and we believe that a nationwide upsurge in purchasing public bonds will quickly arrive.

　　动员起来购买公债
    贺笠
    中央人民政府委员会第四次会议于本月四日通过“关于发行人民胜利折实公债的决定”之后，接着十六日政务政务院第十一次政务会议通过了“一九五○年第一期人民胜利折实公债条例”，决定自明年一月五日起开始发行，公债票额为一分、十分、一百分、五百分四种，年利五厘，在五年内分期偿还，并规定了具体折实办法。这次公债的发行，是为了弥补明年度的财政赤字，以减少通货发行，避免通货膨胀，它是完全符合全体人民利益的，是稳定物价，安定民生最有效的措施。因而当这次公债宣布之后，立即得到全国人民各界人士的拥护，大家特别记得毛主席的一句至理名言：“我们的情况概括地说来就是：有困难的，有办法的，有希望的。”他的话给了我们无穷的力量，指引给我们无限光明的前途。正如许多产业界人士说：“公债能稳定物价，就可使人敢于投资建设。”目前全国各地都开始动员起来，为完成这一公债而努力。
    但是，任何事物的发展都不是没有丝毫困难的，公债的实现是需要人民，特别是持有游资富户，拿出钱来以解决国家财政的开支，中国原就是一个经济落后的国家，又经过长期敌伪的蹂躏，财力物力已远不如战前，因此，也就有些人反映：这次公债没有一人不表造成，但在工商界大家又都在说有困难。于是有些工商界的人士提出一些意见，有的要求“希望公债券能有流动性，在自己手头紧迫时，希望银行能作抵押贷款。”有的提出“这次公债应普遍各个角落，人人取购，平均负担。”还有的提出“希望能以货物顶款，购买公债。”甚至有“希望以金银换购公债”的。从这些谈话中，说明这次公债在工商界是存在着各种不同意见的。
    很显明的，这次公债的发行，在某些人士，特别在工商界表现了一种矛盾心情。他们一方面要求稳定物价，而另一方面又不愿拿出自己的钱来以几年的时间存放在国家手中。怎么办呢？只有两条路，一是自己忍受暂时的小困难，以解决国家的大困难。如此作了，国家财政赤字解决了，通货不膨胀了，同时也使自己今后不受物价波动的困难。另一条路，是只顾个人暂时的利益，不拿出游资来购买公债，让国家财政继续困难，让物价继续波动，使自己的生产事业长期“朝不保夕”（某产业界人士语）。这两条路究竟应当选哪一条路呢？当然应当是前者而不是后者。
    一个人应该有远见，而不应当斤斤计较于狭小的暂时的利益，以免“为小而失大”。
    公债券不能在市场流动。公债如果可以在市场流动，那无异是变相的通货发行，其结果不是收回通货，使货币回笼，反而是会增加通货的膨胀，更可怕的是会造成某些投机商人以渔利的机会，象过去国民党匪帮统治时期的证券交易所，成为投机倒把兴风作浪的场所，危害国家人民，影响巨深。人民政府接受了过去的经验，在这次公债条例中特别明文规定：“不得代替货币流通市面，不得向国家银行抵押，并不得用以作投机买卖。”这一规定是极为重要的，没有这一条就不能收真正稳定物价的效果。全国人都必须严格遵行。
    与这一问题相关联的，上海有一部分资本家，要求发金库券来代替公债。因为解放后我们金银冻结起来，他们的投机资本（金银）不能再在市场活动。因此他们希望发行金库券，把他们的金银交给政府代为保管，变成活动资金，好在市场继续进行投机。这对持有金银的投机商人来说，是大开方便之门，可以为所欲为。但对政府来说，这样不但没有收缩市场通货，相反的把冻结的金银变成流通资金，加入市场投机活动，这与我们发行公债的意义恰恰相反。这是为自己，为投机商人打算；不是为国家，为人民打算。广大人民以至正当的工商业家是反对这种自私自利的要求的。
    公债也不能以货物来顶替的，自然某些有益于国家建设的货物，例如以外销物资交付给国家，国家用以取得外汇，那也是有益的。但一般说来不能以货物顶替，因为这次公债发行目的之一，是为的要紧缩货币，平抑物价，并配合明年度财政工作在国家银行的透支，即发行货币，免致造成通货膨胀。如果大家都交货物，不能不使某些货物在国家手里囤积起来无法销售，相反的货币又不能回笼，通货膨胀的现象仍不能避免。
    “平均负担”的说法也是不妥的。是的，全国人民都有购买公债的义务，这次公债条例也规定了适合于各阶层人民的负担办法，少者可以一分、十分，多者可至数百分数千分。毫无问题，许多购买力很弱的劳动人民，他们也会节衣缩食，省出钱来，认购公债。但是，我们应该认识，不能以平均的办法来劝购的，今天谁也知道，农民的生活最苦。正如大华窑业公司陈荫棠先生所说：“城市无论怎样重，也比农村好。”农民千辛万苦以人力物力财力支持了长期的解放战争，直至今天仍是他们的税负最重，城市税负较轻。如果今天工商界不在负担上来要求平均，而仅仅在认购公债上要求平均，那是说不下去的。工人及其他薪俸阶层的人自然也要尽力拿出钱来购买公债，但这些人毕竟收入微薄，又有家庭负担，不可能拿出很多钱来购买；因此这次公债，不能不主要依靠城市工商界，尤其是游资的持有者来担任。
    当然，这些人当中也是有区别的。这次公债的发行，主要是吸收社会的游资，以用于生产建设，使游资获得正当的出路，不然任其在社会上游离，势必投机倒把，扰乱金融。今天中国工业正在发展，游资较少，只应在不妨碍生产的原则下尽力认购。但商业的游资是较多的，而且利润亦较工业为优，应多购买。特别是那些专以囤积或以金融投机为业的人，以及持有金银美钞的富户，他们的游资应大量投入公债。人民胜利折实公债以实物折算，且有利息，较之囤积窖藏更加有利，而且以之购买公债，解决国家财政困难，亦是对社会的一件功劳，这实是名利双收，一举两得的好事情。
    现在各方正进行动员，我们相信全国争购公债的热潮，一定会迅速到来。
