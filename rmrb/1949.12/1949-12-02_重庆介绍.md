　　The city of Chongqing, liberated yesterday by the People's Liberation Army, is the largest political, military, economic, and cultural center in the southwestern provinces. After the People's Liberation Army captured Guangzhou on October 14th this year, the remnant forces of the Kuomintang bandit gang hastily moved their bogus central government signboard to Chongqing, attempting to make a final stand in southwestern China. However, less than fifty days after the liberation of Guangzhou, this largest political and economic center in the southwest was liberated.
    Chongqing covers an area of ​​300 square kilometers with a population of approximately 1.1 million. The city is located at the confluence of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River, resembling a peninsula. It is a hub for both water and land transportation. Ships can travel upstream along the Yangtze River to Yibin, and downstream through the Three Gorges to Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Upstream along the Jialing River, steamships can reach Hejiang and Nanchong. By land, the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway reaches Guiyang to the south, the Sichuan-Hunan Railway extends eastward to Hunan, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway goes west to Chengdu, and can be further extended south into Xikang and north into Shaanxi. Goods from Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, and Guizhou entering and leaving the Yangtze River all use Chongqing as a transshipment hub, making it the most commercially prosperous city in the southwest. The main export goods are tung oil, bristles, medicinal materials, and salt. There are over 600 industrial enterprises, mainly engaged in clothing manufacturing, chemical industry, match industry, papermaking and printing, and machinery industry. There are 15 large-scale machinery industries, 12 chemical industries, and 16 yarn and textile factories, employing a total of more than 37,000 workers. In terms of education, there are seven institutions of higher learning, including National Chongqing University, National Women's Normal College, and Sichuan Provincial College of Education, more than 80 middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools, and 279 primary schools.

　　重庆介绍
    人民解放军昨日解放的重庆市是西南诸省最大的政治、军事、经济和文化中心。今年十月十四日人民解放军攻占广州后，国民党匪帮残余势力即将其伪中央政府的招牌，匆匆搬到重庆，企图在中国西南大陆上进行最后顽抗。但距广州解放还不到五十天，这一西南最大的政治经济中心即被解放了。
    重庆市面积凡三百方公里，人口一百一十万左右，城当嘉陵江入长江之口，状如半岛。地居水陆总汇，轮船溯长江上达宜宾，顺江而下经万县出三峡可直抵武汉、南京、上海；沿嘉陵江上溯，汽船可达合江、南充。陆路方面，川黔路南达贵阳，川湘路可东出湖南，成渝路西去成都，可转而南入西康，北出陕西。陕、甘、川、康、滇、黔之商货出入长江者，皆以重庆为转运之总枢，故商业之盛，为西南之冠。出口货以桐油、猪鬃、药材和盐为大宗。工业有六百余家，其中以服用品制造业、化学工业、火柴工业、造纸印刷业、机械业为主，规模较大的机器工业有十五家，化学工业十二家，纱厂、纺织厂十六家，职工共三万七千余人。教育方面，专科以上学校有国立重庆大学、国立女子师范、省立四川教育学院等七所，中学、师范及职业学校共达八十余所，小学二百七十九所。
