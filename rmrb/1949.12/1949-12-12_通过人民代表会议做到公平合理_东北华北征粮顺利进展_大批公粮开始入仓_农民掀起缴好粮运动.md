　　Achieving Fairness and Reasonableness Through People's Representative Conferences
  　Grain Procurement Progresses Smoothly in Northeast and North China
    Large Quantities of Public Grain Begin to Enter Warehouses
  　Farmers Launch a Movement to Deliver Good Grain
    [This Newspaper's Report] Grain procurement work in the Northeast and North China provinces is progressing smoothly, with large quantities of grain already entering warehouses in various locations. In Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China, farmers in counties such as Keshan, Hailun, Nehe, and Tao'an are actively paying their dues. In Keshan County alone, over 2,000 grain carts are dispatched daily, with 395 tons of grain already stored. The procurement work across the province is expected to be completed by January of next year. Songjiang Province has also entered the grain delivery phase and is expected to complete its task by the end of the month. In Liaoxi Province, in the old liberated areas of Shuangliao, Tieling, Faku, and other eight counties, public grain has been universally delivered to warehouses. According to statistics from grain depots in Siping, Lishu, Changbei, Changtu, and other locations in the province, 5,000 tons of grain had been stored from the beginning of November to the 18th. Public grain from all counties in the old liberated areas of the province can be fully stored this month. In Rehe Province, the vast number of farmers are milling rice day and night to prepare for delivering public grain, and some districts and villages have already begun sending grain to warehouses. In North China, grain procurement work in Chahar is nearing completion. In Pingyuan Province, grain procurement work has been largely completed, except for the disaster areas around Lake West. In counties such as Linxian and Xiuwu in the province, public grain has been completely stored. In addition, grain procurement work is underway in Shanxi, Hebei, and Suiyuan provinces. Some areas of Pingyuan, Hebei, and Chahar provinces have suffered various disasters this year, and reductions and exemptions have been granted based on the severity of the disaster during procurement.

    The smooth progress of this year's grain procurement work is due not only to the encouragement of the victorious situation, which demonstrates the farmers' enthusiasm for actively supporting the front lines, but also, and most importantly, because local leadership organs have paid attention to the fairness and reasonableness of grain allocation and have implemented the policy of reasonable burden. In the Northeast, Rehe Province has learned from the mistakes of last year's grain procurement, such as distributing quotas based on population or acreage, and has paid special attention to the principle of "taking into account both public and private interests, fairness and reasonableness" this year. It has decided that each village will establish an evaluation committee to genuinely assess land grades and yields. In Liaoxi Province, in addition to providing appropriate reductions and exemptions for disaster areas with yields below 50% of normal, the burden on non-disaster areas will not exceed 20% of normal yields, reducing the burden on farmers by three-quarters compared to the puppet Manchukuo period. For those who achieve yields exceeding normal due to intensive cultivation, their burden will only account for 14% of their actual yields. In North China, Chahar, Hebei, and other provinces have held various meetings at the provincial, special district, and county levels to thoroughly study, calculate, evaluate, and allocate quotas, especially for disaster areas. They have carefully differentiated the severity of disasters, determined the extent of crop failures, and implemented larger reductions for larger disasters and smaller reductions for smaller disasters, truly achieving fairness and reasonableness. Pingyuan Province promptly criticized and educated individual cadres in certain areas who exaggerated the extent of the disaster in an attempt to seek reductions and exemptions, reflecting localism. To address the problem of unbalanced burdens between regions, Hebei Province proposed key adjustments and a revised calculation method, drawing two adjacent counties or districts for comparative evaluation to ensure consistent standards. In newly liberated villages in Suiyuan, Pingyuan, and other provinces, the policy of reasonable burden is being promoted, and farmers are being mobilized to conduct self-reporting and mutual reporting to investigate landlords' concealed land in order to enlighten the farmers' class consciousness and strive for fairness and reasonableness to the greatest extent possible.

    In this year's procurement work, all localities have paid attention to discussing and deploying autumn procurement tasks and implementing burden policies through people's representative conferences at all levels. In Rehe Province, in the first half of November, counties successively convened county-level people's representative conferences and decided to universally convene village-level people's representative conferences to organize evaluation committees to implement the policy of reasonable burden. In Liaoxi Province, counties also universally convened county-level and district-level people's representative conferences at the end of October and the beginning of November to discuss how to complete the autumn procurement task. At the meetings, people's representatives from all sectors self-reported their yields and fairly and reasonably allocated tasks. After the meetings, widespread publicity was conducted, influencing farmers to actively self-report concealed land. In Mancheng County, Hebei Province, due to the fact that the allocation of autumn procurement tasks was fairer and more reasonable than in previous years through people's representative conferences at all levels, and the district-to-district and village-to-village burdens were largely balanced, with the general burden in disaster areas, except for those with reductions and exemptions, not exceeding 15% of total agricultural income, and not exceeding 20% in non-disaster areas. In Guangling and Huairen counties, Chahar Province, after the task was assigned to the village, the village representative conference would first study it, draft a proposal, and then submit it to the masses for deliberation and discussion, solicit opinions, and then discuss it again through the representative conference before officially announcing the allocation figures. As a result, everyone was satisfied, enthusiastically delivered grain, and the task was completed quickly.

    Due to the correct implementation of the reasonable burden policy, the vast number of farmers in Northeast and North China have universally launched a movement to "deliver good grain" and "deliver public grain early and quickly." Farmers in Heilongjiang Province have universally adopted methods such as winnowing, sifting, and selecting to choose superior grain for delivery.

    In addition, various locations in North China have promptly corrected subjectivism in allocation and coercive command styles in procurement work. For example, Cheji Village in Dingxian County, Hebei Province, produced only 6,000 catties of cotton, but was assigned a procurement quota of 10,000 catties. After being discovered by the leading organs, it was immediately corrected. In some disaster-stricken villages in Chahar and Pingyuan provinces, reductions and exemptions were only given to poor households and not to middle peasants, or reductions were given to poor households and added to the burden on middle peasants. These phenomena have been corrected due to timely inspections by leading organs at all levels.

　　通过人民代表会议做到公平合理
  　东北华北征粮顺利进展
    大批公粮开始入仓
  　农民掀起缴好粮运动
    【本报讯】东北、华北各省征粮工作，正顺利开展，各地大批粮食已开始入仓。东北黑龙江省的克山、海伦、讷河、洮安等县农民积极缴纳，仅克山一县，每日即出动粮车二千余辆，入仓粮食已达三百九十五吨。全省征收工作预计明年一月即可结束。松江省也进入送粮阶段，预计月底即可完成任务。辽西省老区双辽、铁岭、法库等八县公粮已普遍入仓。据该省四平、梨树、昌北、昌图等处粮库统计，自十一月初至十八日止，入仓粮食已达五千吨。该省老区各县公粮本月可全部入仓。热河省广大农民正日夜碾米准备交公粮，部分区村已开始送粮入仓。在华北，察哈尔征收工作已接近结束。平原省除湖西灾区外，征粮工作已大体完成。该省林县、修武等县，公粮已全部入仓。此外，山西、河北、绥远等省，征粮工作正在开展。平原、河北、察哈尔等省的若干地区因今年遭受各种灾害，在征收中已分别灾情轻重予以减免。
    今年征粮工作之所以进行顺利，除了胜利形势的鼓舞，表现了农民积极支援前线的热忱外，其中一个最主要的原因，就是各地领导机关注意到了分配粮数的公平合理，贯彻执行了合理负担政策。在东北，热河省接受去年征粮中按人平摊、按亩平摊等错误作法的教训，今年特别注意“公私兼顾、公平合理”的原则，决定每村都成立评议委员会，切实评定地等、产量。辽西省除对灾区五成以下年景者作适当减免外，非灾区负担亦不超过常年产量的百分之二十，使农民负担较伪满时期减轻四分之三。因精耕细作而收获超过常年产量者，其负担只占实际产量的百分之十四。在华北，察哈尔、河北等省，通过省、专区、县的各种会议，详细研究、计算、评议、分配，特别是对灾区，周密地分别灾情轻重，确定了歉收成数，实行灾大多减，灾小少减，做到真正公平合理。平原省对个别地区干部夸大灾情企图减免的本位主义思想，及时提出了批评教育。对地区间负担不平衡问题，河北省提出重点调整，改算负担的办法，抽两相邻近的县或区，进行比较评定，做到标准一致。在绥远、平原等省新区村庄，则宣传合理负担政策，发动农民进行自报互报，清查地主黑地，以启发农民的阶级觉悟，尽量作到公平合理。
    在今年的征收工作中，各地都注意到了通过各界人民代表会议，讨论布置秋征任务，贯彻负担政策。热河省在十一月上半月，各县即相继召开了县人民代表会议，并决定普遍召开村人民代表会议，组织评议委员会，以贯彻合理负担政策。辽西省各县亦在十月底十一月初，普遍召开县区人民代表会议，讨论了如何完成秋征任务的问题。会上各界人民代表自报产量，公平合理地分配了任务。会后并进行广泛宣传，影响农民纷纷自报黑地。河北省满城县，由于通过各界代表会议，秋征任务的分配较历年均公平合理，区与区、村与村间做到大体平衡，灾区除减免者外，一般负担未超过农业总收入百分之十五，非灾区未超过百分之二十，察省广灵、怀仁等县，在任务分配到村后，先由村代表会加以研究，拟出草案，然后交群众酝酿讨论，提出意见，再经代表会讨论，才正式公布分配数字，结果人人满意，热烈交粮，任务完成很快。
    由于正确实行合理负担政策，东北、华北广大农民，均普遍掀起了“缴好粮”和“早缴快缴”公粮的运动。黑龙江农民普遍采取用风、筛、选等办法，挑选上等粮食送缴。
    此外华北各地在征收工作中，均及时纠正了分配中的主观主义与征收中的强迫命令作风。如河北定县车寄村全村产棉仅六千余斤，却布置征棉一万斤。经领导机关发现后，即予纠正。察哈尔、平原两省有些灾区村庄，只减免贫户不减中农，或减了贫户加在中农身上，这些现象由于各级领导机关及时检查也得到了纠正。
