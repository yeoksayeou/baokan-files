　　North China Factories Under the Ministry of Heavy Industry
    Inspect Production Safety Equipment
    Enormous State Property Spared from Losses

    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Heavy Industry instructed its affiliated North China companies and factories to conduct a comprehensive emergency inspection of equipment protecting state property and production safety, starting in mid-November, which has now initially concluded. Based on the actual inspections of over forty units from companies and factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, and Taiyuan, numerous problems were discovered related to machinery and equipment, construction, storage of materials, and safety equipment. At the same time, the following gains were made: (1) Phenomena that were previously overlooked and considered normal, but were in a dangerous state, were given attention and serious handling began, ensuring the elimination of major damage incidents. For example, in a certain chemical factory, a hundred tons of explosives were originally stored inside the factory; at the Shijingshan Foundry, ten thousand bundles of straw rope were stored on the ground floor of a factory building; a certain chemical factory had a flammable oil depot adjacent to a warehouse; the Northwest Steel Plant burned asphalt in front of a warehouse, etc. Although it was known in the past that these were inappropriate, no attention was paid to them. These issues have now been resolved during this inspection. At the same time, the original work has been pushed forward and deepened. For example, the power plant of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, due to the damage to the "turbine" of the No. 6 generator at the Shijingshan Power Plant, was alerted and planned to inspect the plant's 6,400-kilowatt large generator. Although it had already started, it had not been carried out seriously; however, during this emergency inspection, it was further strictly inspected, and as a result, major problems such as the corrosion of the turbine blades and the wear of the four bearings were discovered, and repairs were immediately carried out. (2) The workers' ideological awareness of cherishing state property has been strengthened, resulting in preliminary improvements in management, and preliminary formulation or ongoing formulation of various regulations and rules. For example, the warehouse of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company had many materials with no accounts at all in the past, and some of the account numbers did not match the goods. After a thorough inspection, systems such as material numbering, setting up cards, establishing acceptance and allocation, material scrapping, and fixed asset management were established. (3) Through this inspection, democracy was promoted, leadership was improved, and production efficiency was increased. For example, a certain machine factory promoted democracy during the inspection, and workers provided 734 suggestions on various unreasonable systems, equipment, technology, construction, and other issues. The leadership gave appropriate treatment to each suggestion separately, resolving those that could be resolved immediately or using them as a reference for improving future work; those that could not be done temporarily were explained clearly to the workers. During the inspection period of a certain automobile assembly plant, criticisms and improvements were made to the past bad work style of individual foremen, and the production of "pistons" increased sharply from 200 to 600, increasing by two times. (4) Increased national wealth. Through inspection, many valuable and useful materials were found in the waste piles: the foundry of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant found 90 machine parts outside the warehouse, 11 cartloads of angle iron and culverts outside the factory building, and 4 tons of usable steel plates and 4 drums of calcium carbide from crushed steel and waste calcium carbide. In addition, 41 tons of various pipes in more than 50 varieties, which had no accounts in the past, were found. A certain steel plant found 30 tons of usable lead wire in the process of sorting out waste materials, worth 200 million yuan (according to November market prices).

    Reasons for Success: Serious, Responsible Attitude from Top to Bottom, Paying Attention to Relying on Workers and Mobilizing the Masses
    Close Cooperation Between Administration, Labor Union, Party, and Youth League

The reason why this inspection was relatively fruitful is that: First of all, the leadership, starting from the Ministry of Heavy Industry, adopted an extremely serious and responsible attitude, established an inspection committee, used the method of level-by-level inspection and individual spot checks, and sent two inspection teams to directly conduct inspections and promote work. In order to arrange inspections and provide specific guidance, a total of four instructions were issued before and after, grasping the reports of each unit, and constantly using telegrams and telephones to urge and promote. Therefore, all companies and factories attached great importance to it, generally established inspection organizations, and seriously discussed inspection work in accordance with the instructions. Secondly, attention was generally paid to mobilizing workers and giving play to the power of the masses in the work. The ironmaking plant of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant also had a system for managing machines in the past, but it could never be adhered to. This time, after workers researched and discussed it, in addition to revisions and supplements, they also proposed strong guarantees. A certain power company linked the loss of state property with the vulnerability of workers to danger to enlighten education, and everyone did it very seriously, so the inspection was relatively detailed and in-depth. In addition, the close cooperation and unified pace of the administrative aspects of various cities and factories, the municipal committees and factory branches of the Communist Party, the labor unions, and the Youth League, all taking the inspection as the central work, is also one of the important keys. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China used the inspection instructions of the Ministry of Heavy Industry to arrange for cadres to study materials.

In the inspection, it was also found that individual units put the instructions aside; or the inspection work was generalized and lacked focus, raising problems without solving them; some inspections did not play their due role; some cadres and employees exaggerated the existing problems of the machines due to fear of responsibility; and some units still had damage incidents during the inspection period. Therefore, in order to truly avoid and reduce the occurrence of unfortunate accidents in the future, more efforts need to be made on the basis of this inspection: A strict and regular inspection system should be established, striving to be careful, concerned, and cherishing factory equipment, opposing any slackness and麻痹 (paralysis/apathy), and implementing the spirit of this inspection in daily work. And pay attention to combining safety protection with production, clearly stipulating various systems for protecting machine safety and protecting property, and promoting everyone to strictly implement them. It is also necessary to continuously implement employee education and enlighten all employees to consciously cherish state property.

　　重工业部所属华北各厂
    检查生产安全设备
    巨大的国家财产得免遭受损失
    【本报讯】重工业部布置所属华北各公司、工厂，从十一月中旬起对保护国家财产与生产安全设备普遍进行紧急检查，现已初步告一段落。根据京、津、张、唐、太原各公司，工厂四十余单位的实际检查，发现了有关机器设备、建筑、器材保管、安全设备等方面的问题很多。同时获得以下收获：（一）把一些过去熟视无睹习以为常而处于危险状态的现象予以重视，并开始认真处理，保证了消灭重大损害事件之发生。如某化学厂百吨炸药原搁厂内，石景山铸造厂一万捆草绳存在厂房楼下，某化学厂将易燃之油库与仓库毗连，西北钢铁厂在仓库前烧沥青等，过去虽明知不妥却未加理会，此次检查中均已解决。同时，把原来所做的工作更推动深入了一步。如石景山钢铁厂的动力厂，因鉴于石景山发电厂六号发电机“特尔滨”损坏而引起警惕，计划检查本厂之六千四百基罗瓦特大发机，虽已开始，而并未认真进行；而在此次布置紧急检查中，才更进一步地严格检查，结果发现汽叶已被腐蚀，四个轴承磨损等重大毛病，随即进行修整。（二）使职工在思想上加强了爱护国家财产观念，因之在管理上有了初步改进，初步订立了或正在订立各种条例守则，如石景山钢铁公司仓库，过去有许多器材根本没有帐，也有的帐货数字不符，经过彻底检查，订立了材料编号、设置卡片、建立验收调拨、材料报废、因定资财管理等制度。（三）通过这次检查，发扬民主，改进了领导，提高了生产效率。如某机器厂在检查中发扬了民主，工人对各种不合理的制度、设备、技术、建筑等问题，提供意见达七百三十四条。领导上均分别予以适当处理，能解决的马上解决，或作为改进今后工作参考；暂时不能做的则向工人解说清楚。某汽车制配厂检查期间，并进行了批评与改进过去个别领班的不良作风，做“活塞”生产遂由二百个激增至六百个，提高了二倍。（四）增加了国家财富。通过检查，从废料堆里找出了很多宝贵有用的物资：石景山钢铁厂铸造厂从仓库外找出九十件机器零件，厂房外找出十一马车的三角铁、道管等，从碎钢与废电石中，找出四吨可用之钢板和四筒电石，更找出过去没有帐的四十一吨各种管子，计五十多种。某制钢厂则在整理废料中找出可用的铅丝三十吨，价值二亿元（按十一月份市价。）
    　　　　获得成绩的原因：自上至下认真严肃负责注意依靠工人发动群众
    　　行政工会党团密切配合
    这次检查之所以比较有收获，其原因是：首先是领导上自重工业部起，都采取了极严肃的认真负责的态度，建立了检查委员会，运用逐级检查个别抽查的方法，派出了两个检查小组，直接深入检查与推动工作。为布置检查及具体指导工作，前后共发出四次指示，抓紧各单位作报告，并随时利用电报电话督促推动。因此，各公司工厂都极重视，普遍建立起检查组织，并按照指示认真讨论检查工作。其次是工作中普遍注意了发动工人，发挥了群众力量。石景山钢铁厂炼铁厂过去也有管理机器的制度，但总是不能坚持，这次经工人研究讨论，除修正补充外，并提出有力的保证。某电力公司把国家财产损失与工人易遭受危险连系起来启发教育，大家就做得非常认真，因此检查较为细致深入。还有各市及工厂行政方面、共产党各市委与工厂支部、工会、青年团的密切配合统一步调，皆以检查为中心工作，亦是重要关键之一。中共太原市委即以重工业部检查指示，布置作干部学习材料。
    在检查中，也曾发现个别单位把指示搁置一旁；或检查工作一般化缺乏重点，提出问题不解决问题；有的检查未发挥其应有的作用；部分干部职工，因畏惧责任而把机器现存问题说得更加严重；有的单位在检查期内仍有损坏事件发生。因此，为了今后真正避免与减少不幸事故发生，在此检查基础上，还需加以更大的努力：要建立严格的经常检查制度，务求慎重关心爱护工厂设备，反对任何懈怠与麻痹，把这次检查精神在日常工作中贯彻下去。并注意保护安全与生产相结合，明文规定保护机器安全及保护财产的各种制度，促使大家严格执行。还要不断地贯彻职工教育，启发全体职工自觉地爱护国家财产。
