Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 21st: The French Communist Party's official newspaper, L'Humanité, published an editorial by Cachin on the 15th entitled "Organize to Oppose the Shameful War," stating: The French Democratic Youth Committee recently issued a call to all French workers, political, and cultural organizations, demanding peace in Vietnam. This call was signed by militant youth from various backgrounds, including Communists, Christians, left-wing Socialists, Radical Party members, young artists, writers, athletes, exiled people, unemployed people, and more. "Returnees from Vietnam" are scheduled to hold their first national congress at the Paris Labor Exchange on December 17th. A national movement is being organized to make the government hear the voice of the vast majority of the French people. The laboring, democratic, progressive, and humane France demands that negotiations for a peace treaty with Ho Chi Minh begin immediately, and that France must withdraw its troops from Vietnam. Due to the recent developments in the situation in Vietnam, and the entry of Chiang Kai-shek's defeated mercenary army into Vietnamese territory, this movement has taken on special importance. All honest French men and women know that over ninety percent of the Vietnamese people are determined to fight to the death in order to live freely in their homeland, and they have been victoriously fighting for independence for three years. They are no longer willing to be subjected to the shameful exploitation of the "Indochina Bank" and the robbers of the Lazare Bank, the millionaires of the rice, coal, wine, and rubber industries, and the owners of casinos and brothels. They are determined not to let themselves endure the plundering of tens of millions of francs by international adventurers.

Now, we are told that the American imperialists hope to join France in eliminating the Vietnamese people. This is forgetting the blind behavior of Chiang Kai-shek's adventure in China. In China, Truman, Harriman, and Mr. Bullitt also tried to stop the democratic movement of the Chinese people, but people know how that turned out. Bao Dai will soon know the fate of Chiang Kai-shek.

To insist on pouring France's millions of francs into the bottomless pit of Vietnam is madness, it is a big mistake. The impoverished French people must use all their resources to rebuild their homes. Democratic France knows that a liberated, democratic Vietnam will become their friend in the world struggle for human liberation next year. This explains why we fully support the actions taken by the "Returnees from Vietnam" demanding that the government quickly achieve peace in Vietnam. Their hope that not a single Frenchman or Vietnamese will shed blood in Vietnam any longer is in France's interest, it is the demand of humanity, and it is a condition for world peace.

　　法共人道报发表加香所作社论
    反对可耻的侵越战争
    主张立即与胡志明和平谈判
    【新华社布拉格二十一日电】法共机关报人道报于十五日登载加香所作题为“组织起来，反对可耻的战争”的社论称：法国民主青年委员会最近向法国所有职工、政治、文化团体发出号召，要求在越南实现和平。这一号召是由各种不同来历的战斗青年签名的，其中有共产党员、基督徒、左派社会党员、激进党员、青年艺术家、作家、运动员、被放逐的人们、失业者等等。“从越南返国者”定于十二月十七日在巴黎职工大楼举行首次全国大会。人们正在组织一个全国运动，使政府听到绝大多数法国人民的呼声。劳动人民的、民主的、进步的、人道的法国，要求立刻与胡志明开始谈判和平条约，法国必须自越南撤军。由于最近越南形势的发展，由于溃退的蒋介石雇佣军队进入越南国土，这一运动更有了特殊的重要性。一切正直的法国男女们都知道：百分之九十以上的越南人民，为了能在他们的祖国自由生活，决心誓死作战，他们为了求得独立，已经胜利地进行了三年的战斗。他们决不愿意再受“印度支那银行”和拉杂尔银行的强盗们，米、煤、酒、橡皮业的百万富翁们和赌场妓寮老板们的可耻的剥削，他们决心不再让自己忍受国际冒险家们作千万金钱的搜刮。
    现在，人们对我们说，美帝国主义者希望和法国共同来消灭越南人民，这是忘记了蒋介石在中国的冒险的盲目行为。在中国，杜鲁门、哈里曼、蒲立特先生们，也曾经企图阻止中国人民的民主运动，但是，人们知道这事的结果已经如何，保大不久就会知道蒋介石的命运的。
    坚持把法国的万万金钱投入越南的无底洞里，这是发疯，这是大错。贫困的法国人民须要把全部资源去重建家园。民主法国知道解放后的民主越南，明年将成为他们在为人类解放的世界斗争中的朋友。这说明为什么我们全力支持“从越南回国者”们要求政府尽速在越南实现和平所采取的行动。他们希望在越南不再有一个法国人和一个越南人流血，这是法国的利益所在，这是人类的要求，这是世界和平的一个条件。
