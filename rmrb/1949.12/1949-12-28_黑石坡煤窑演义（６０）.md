　　Black Rock Slope Coal Mine Chronicles (60)
    Kang Tuo
    In the afternoon, they really did dig up the "Seven"! This news instantly spread throughout the village, causing everyone to panic as if they were in the midst of a war! It turned out that this "Seven" was grayish-white, not like soil, not like coal, not like stone, and had a choking odor. You couldn't dig much with force, but when you hit it right, you could dig up a large chunk. The older generation said: encountering "Seven" at the bottom of the mine means it's not seven feet, seven zhang, or seven li deep, but seventeen feet, seventeen zhang, or seventeen li, or even seventy li... No one could say for sure how deep it was, but it had to be a "Seven" number, so they called it "Seven." Great! Now, who knew if it was seven feet or seventy li deep? When Little Foreign Devil heard the news, he rushed to the mine, only to find the mine site and the accounting room in complete chaos. He hurried off to find Old Yin.
    Over here, Da San had already determined that the "Seven" wasn't a major problem and was resting with Tianlu in Old Yin's house. Old Yin was casually talking to them about the Zhengtai Railway, the Wudu Bridge, industry, and the working class. Also, because the village had already agreed to lend scrap copper and iron to the mine, and today Xilu and Linbao had gone to Yangquan to exchange it for grain, while Shuancheng had gone to the district for some business and hadn't returned, Old Yin and the others were waiting for them to come back to hold a meeting of shareholder representatives and a shareholders' meeting to discuss the "Seven" issue and settle the accounts. Little Foreign Devil rushed over, and as soon as he entered, he interrupted them, saying, "Look at you... What are you going to do about this 'Seven'! People are spouting nonsense again, saying the Old Lord is punishing Da San, that Da San is letting women go down the mine..." Old Yin quickly asked, "Who's saying all this?" Little Foreign Devil finally calmed down and said, "Ah! It's nothing, why ask about that! Let's talk about the real issue!" Tianlu said, "The real issue is that you should explain things to the people! Do you still believe in this feudal old mindset?" Little Foreign Devil quickly said, "Of course not! I already told Taicheng and Niubao to stop talking nonsense..." Old Yin laughed and said, "Is it them again?" Little Foreign Devil said, "Who? Hey... Look at my mouth! Hey... But they were just joking in front of everyone, I know they didn't mean any harm." Da San told Little Foreign Devil about the "Seven," and just then Xilu, Shuancheng, and the others returned. Everyone then went together to hold a meeting.
    56 Hard Wind
    After the "Seven" was dug out in the East Mine, Da San scheduled three shifts a day, day and night, with four people per shift to dig, but they could only dig two or three feet a day, and the height and width were only three or four feet. Although Da San firmly said at the shareholders' meeting, "This 'Seven' is not a big deal!" and Shuancheng and Tianlu were constantly supporting Da San from below, people were still uneasy. At this time, the village had finished dividing the land and posted the list, waiting only to collect final opinions, so people didn't have much else to do and focused all their attention on the mine, the air duct, and the "Seven." All sorts of good and bad words, openly and secretly, inevitably flew everywhere. Some of the mine's shareholders truly trusted Da San, Shuancheng, and Tianlu, or maybe they didn't quite trust them, but they knew that the mine had to be worked to the end no matter what, so they didn't say much. But there were also some who were panicking all day long. If you asked them about the "Seven," they would say, "How can we hold the bottom line? We've already dug more than seven feet! We shareholders are just doing our part and following the crowd." Taicheng also said, "I don't dare say anything right or wrong! I lost face at this mine, let's see about Da San this time!" When Little Foreign Devil heard some unpleasant words, sometimes he would explain a few words to people, but sometimes he would join in and add a sentence! Even the Liu Gou family was panicking these days. She didn't joke around much anymore. Baiquan's family, who lived with her, had moved out after dividing the house, but still came to find her from time to time, as if trying to stir something up, but she didn't have the mind to talk much with them. Later, someone in the village suddenly said, "What if the mine is ruined? When we lent the silver dollars, we said it would be repaid; but they're all shareholders! What are they going to repay us with!" This really struck a chord, and the whole village spread this sentence in no time! Da San remained silent, saying, "Anyway, I'll risk my life to do it, let everyone make a decision at the meeting!" Shuancheng was still very firm, explaining to people, "Why do you think the mine will be ruined and lose money? By this time next year, who knows how much we'll earn! Stop saying that!" Tianlu was also good, always saying, "This is our own world! Don't panic, we'll definitely make it!" Xilu was also calm, often saying, "This is a new era, with many people and broad minds, and strong spirit, so it's definitely safe." However, there weren't many others who spoke firmly and supported them! Yubao did say, "It's not a big deal! Anyway, I trust our Third Master Da San!" But no one listened to him. As for Old Yin, whether in meetings or casual talks, he always used the various principles he had heard from Da San to explain and reassure people. However, sometimes he thought to himself, "Better safe than sorry!" What if something really went wrong? How could he bear the responsibility? What could he do to deal with it...? He didn't dare to think further! He felt that Shuancheng, Tianlu, and Da San seemed to be more calm than him! Shuancheng and Tianlu were the ones he had recently introduced to join the Communist Party: this made him happy. He then pondered: should he also absorb Da San into the party...?
    Old Bai also knew that the "Seven" had been dug out in the ventilation tunnel at the bottom of the mine. He took the time to come and take a look. Afterwards, Old Yin quickly pulled him aside and quietly asked, "Do you think there's a problem?" He said, "No problem! Da San said that in no more than three days, we should be able to hear the sound of picks from the opposite side in the east and west ventilation tunnels, I think that's how it is." After speaking, he looked at Old Yin, as if he had seen through a little of Old Yin's thoughts, and said, "You must be very worried, right? It's nothing, this is not a big deal in the mine; it's no wonder you haven't seen this before, besides, there aren't many knowledgeable mine workers in this village!" Old Yin felt more at ease, but Old Bai said again, "Don't think it's over now, there may be more troublesome things in the future! Old Yin, now this mine is at a critical juncture, you keep a good eye on it! Whoever can remain calm and exert effort to overcome the critical juncture, that person will have endured the test... Aren't you establishing a Party organization and recruiting party members?" Old Yin felt his heart "thump thump" and felt full of energy, he quickly grabbed Old Bai, still wanting to talk more, but Old Bai was too busy to leave. Just then, Xilu came looking for them and said, "Good, you're all here! Shuancheng and the others have been worried these past two days, and I don't want to bother them anymore; but tell me! We're running out of grain again!" Old Bai said, "I'll take care of this, wait for news in three to five days!" After speaking, he left quickly.
    Fortunately, nothing else happened afterwards, and moreover, the tops of the east and west mine ventilation tunnels quickly heard the sound of picks from the opposite side. The tension at the mine eased somewhat, and people worked with a little more effort. But on the third day after Old Bai left, Xilu came to ask Old Yin in a panic again, "Still no news? The accounts really won't last for two more days! Most of the automatically reduced supply amounts are also due!" Old Yin quickly wrote a letter to Old Bai urging him to send it, and immediately sent someone to deliver it. Unexpectedly, just as the messenger left, someone outside was shouting, "Shuancheng! Old Yin! Old Yin!" Coming out, it was just Little Foreign Devil running inside trembling all over, while shouting, "No... No... No! Shuancheng... Shuancheng, where are you?" Old Yin said, "What happened? Rest a little, calm down, and tell us properly!" Little Foreign Devil was still panting and shouting, "Oh dear! @Damn it, this... this mine... mine..." Old Yin was also anxious, but Little Foreign Devil just wouldn't say. Just then, Shuancheng, Bian Xiao Da, Da San, Tianlu, and Xilu all came together, and Little Foreign Devil said, "Ask... ask our Third Uncle Da San..." Everyone then went into the house together.
    It turned out that something rare that was difficult to encounter even in a thousand years had happened in the big mine: the weather was warm early this year, and at the end of the second lunar month, the wind at the bottom of the mine had become hard! The oil lamp wouldn't stay lit!

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（６０）
    康濯
    到后晌，果然刨出了“七”，这讯息刹时传遍全村，闹得人人都象碰了兵慌马乱一样！原来这“七”灰白灰白的，不象土，不象炭，不象石头，还有一股味气呛人，使劲创也刨不下什么，可碰对了又能刨下一大块；老辈人们传说：窑底碰见了“七”，那不是七尺七丈七里深，便是十七尺十七丈十七里，或是七十里……那么深，谁也说不准，反正得碰个“七”的数目，因此就管这叫“七”。好呀！这可知道是七尺或七十里深的“七”呀！小洋鬼听见讯，赶到窑上，只见窑场和柜房闹得象一锅稀糊糊，他就急忙撒开腿找老尹去了。
    这边大三却已经看好了“七”碍事不大，正和天禄在老尹屋里歇着，老尹给他们闲捣拉着正太铁路、五渡大桥、工业和工人阶级的一些事；又因为村里早通过了把碎铜铁也借给窑上，今天喜禄林宝闹了那去阳泉换粮食去了，拴成去区里有事也没回，老尹们就一边等着他们回来开股东代表会和股东大会，说说“七”的事和结结帐目。小洋鬼赶到这里，一进门就打断他们道：“你看你们……这‘七’可怎么办呀！人们又瞎他妈胡扯老君爷罚大三啦，大三让妇女下窑啦……”老尹忙问：“尽谁们说的？”小洋鬼这才沉住气道：“唉！淡事情，问这些哩！说正经的吧！”天禄说：“正经的嘛，你该给人们解说啊！你还信服这封建旧脑筋？”小洋鬼忙道：“那还用说！我早就安顿了泰成牛宝他们，叫甭那么瞎说……”老尹笑道：“又是他们说的？”小洋鬼道：“谁们？嗨……你看我这嘴！嗨……可他们也是当着众人要耍笑笑说的，我知道他们也没什么恶意。”大三告给小洋鬼“七”的事，正好喜禄拴成他们都回了，大伙就相跟着开会去了。
    五十六　硬风
    东窑刨出“七”来以后，大三给这里拨调成每天日夜三班，每班四个人刨，但每天也只能刨进去二三尺，高宽还不过三四尺。虽说大三在股东大会上咬定一句话：“这‘七’不碍大事！”拴成天禄又在下边给大三一个劲撑腰，但人们总是不放心。这时村里分完了地，贴出了榜，只等搜集最后意见，因此人们都没多的事，便一心一意看着这窑这风筒和这“七”，明里暗里的好话赖话，不免也就满天飞。窑上的股东，倒也有不少真正信服大三拴成天禄他们，或是不大信服吧，反正知道窑怎么也得干到底，便没什么说头；但却也有一些整日心慌意乱，你若问他“七”的事，他便说：“咱还能拿住底底？反正早刨过了七尺了！咱这股东也不过是卖卖力气，跟众人跑的。”泰成也是这么说：“咱可长短也不敢说话！我是在这窑上丢了人的，这回大三嘛，看吧！”小洋鬼听见些不受听的话，有时他也给人解说两句，但有时他还要凑上去帮着说句把！就连柳沟家，这阵子也心慌的不行，她不大跟人耍笑了；跟她住在一块的白泉家，自己分了房搬出去了，却还不时来找她，象要捣拉个什么的，她却也没心思跟人家多说话。后来，村里忽然有人这样说：“万一这窑要毁了，可怎么办啊！咱们借给现洋那会，倒也有话说是包还；可尽是一把子什么股东！他拿个球来还！”这真是打动人心，一会就浑村传遍了这句话！大三听说了，倒还是不声不响，说嘛也是说：“反正我破着命干，大伙开会拿主意呗！”拴成还很硬，给人解说道：“你怎么想到这窑会毁会赔？赶明年这会，还不知要挣多少哩！快别那么说！”天禄也不赖，一说起就是这么一句：“这可是咱自己的天下哩！甭着慌，总会闹成的！”喜禄也不慌不忙，常说：“这会新世道，人多志广，劲头也硬，准保险。”可是，别人说硬话撑腰的却实在不多！玉宝倒说过：“不吃紧！反正我信得过咱大三爷！”但他的话没什么人听。再说老尹，不论开会或是闲捣拉，他总一个劲拿他从大三那里听到的各种道理，给人解说，宽人的心；不过，有时他一个人私下里想着：“不怕一万，就怕万一！”真个要有个万一的，自己可怎么担待？可想什么法对付……他也不敢往下想！他觉着好象拴成天禄大三比他还能沉住气些！拴成和天禄，是他最近介绍参加了共产党的：这倒也让他高兴；他便又捉摸着：该不该也吸收大三参加呢……
    老白也知道了这窑底风筒道里刨出了“七”，他抽个工夫匆忙地来看了一回，过后老尹赶紧拉住他悄悄问：“你说没问题么？”他道：“没问题！大三说迟不过三天，东西风筒道里，许能听见对面镢头刨着的音响，我看也就是那么的。”说完，他看了看老尹，象是看透了老尹一点什么心事一般，又道：“你许是很担心吧？没什么，这在窑里头算不了个大事；你没经见过这，也难怪你，再说这村见多识广的窑黑又不多的！”老尹安心了些，老白却又说：“甭看这会，往后还许有再麻烦的事情也说不定！老尹，如今这窑正是紧要关头，你好好瞅着吧！谁能沉住气使出劲冲过紧要关头，那谁就算是经住了磨炼的……你不是正在建立党的组织，吸收党员么？”老尹不觉心中“卜通通”发跳，并觉着浑身劲头足足地，忙拉住老白，还想好好说说话，但老白却忙的非走不行；正在这时，喜禄寻来说道：“好你们都在的！这两天拴成他们操心的不行，我也不想再搅扰他们；可你们说吧！粮食又快没有哩！”老白道：“这我负责，三五天听讯吧！”说完，他就紧着走了。
    以后幸好没别的事，而且东西窑风筒行道顶头起，很快就真个听见了对面镢头刨着的响音，窑上的紧张劲也松了些，人们干得也加了点力气。只是到老白走后的第三天，喜禄又慌慌张张来问老尹：“还没讯么？柜上可真是不够两天缴用了哩！自动少支供应的，也多数到期啦！”老尹忙写信给老白催问，并赶紧派人送去；不想送信的人刚出门，外边却有人直嚷：“拴成！老尹！老尹”走出来，只是小洋鬼浑身哆嗦地往里跑，一边又吆喝：“不行……不……不行！拴……拴成呢？”老尹道：“到底什么事？你歇一歇平平气，好好说说嘛！”小洋鬼还是直喘气直吆喝：“嗳呀呀！＠他妈的这……这窑……窑……”，老尹也急得不行，小洋鬼可就是不说，恰好这时拴成扁小大三天禄喜禄都相跟着来了，小洋鬼才说：“问……问咱大……大三叔吧！”众人便一同进屋。
    原来大窑里又出了千年难遇的稀罕事：今年天气暖和得早，才阴历二月底，窑底的风就硬了！油扁点不下去了！
