　　Beijing City Textile and Dyeing Industry Signs Labor-Management Collective Contract
　　Specifically stipulates reasonable methods for capital's dismissal of employees, maternity leave for female workers, employee cultural and educational expenses, etc.
　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Labor Bureau officially approved the Beijing Textile and Dyeing Industry Labor-Management Collective Contract on November 25. The signing and approval conference of the contract was solemnly held in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. In addition to the representatives of labor and capital and the representatives of the industry's trade unions and guilds, more than 100 people attended the conference. Representatives from agencies and organizations such as the Central Ministry of Labor, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Municipal Bureau of Industry also participated. At the meeting, the full text of the contract was first read out, and the representatives of both labor and capital unanimously approved it with applause and signed the contract in turn. Ma Guangdou, Deputy Director of the Labor Bureau, announced the official approval on behalf of the People's Government and emphasized in his speech: This contract is a step forward compared with the four collective contracts already signed. It more specifically stipulates the conditions for capital to dismiss employees, maternity leave for female workers before and after childbirth, and employee cultural and educational expenses. In particular, the adoption of a piece-rate progressive wage system will have a significant impact on future production development. He hoped that on the basis of this concrete realization of mutual benefit for labor and capital, both parties would respect and yield to each other to develop production. Guo Jingyan, the representative of the labor side, and Wan Jingshu, the representative of the capital side, and five others spoke at the meeting one after another, all unanimously guaranteeing to earnestly implement the provisions of the contract and improve production. At the end of the meeting, the entire audience warmly applauded to express their respect to the government. The signing of the Beijing Textile and Dyeing Industry Labor-Management Collective Contract has experienced various obstacles and difficulties. In June of this year, labor and capital began to brew and draft the original contract, and after many consultations and discussions and repeated revisions, an agreement was reached in August. However, later, due to internal conflicts on the capital side, some agreements in the contract were overturned. In October, due to urgent needs, the capital side voluntarily requested the Labor Bureau to sign the contract according to the original agreement. Wan Jingshu, the chief representative of the capital side, also made a review at the Labor-Capital Representative Conference, admitting that he should be responsible for the delay in signing the contract. After thoroughly studying the content of the contract, the Labor Bureau put forward some important amendments to both labor and capital, such as specific regulations on dismissal issues; setting the highest wage as the minimum wage; and suggesting that the progressive wage table be changed to an annex to take care of the different situations of large and small factories, etc. After a detailed explanation, both labor and capital said: "This is good for production" and unanimously accepted it.
　　This is the fifth labor-management collective contract signed in Beijing. In addition, the pottery, bathhouse, and handmade paper industries in Beijing have successively established temporary collective agreements and will sign formal collective contracts according to the needs of each industry.

　　京市织染业签订劳资集体合同
    具体规定资方解雇职工条件、女工分娩假
    期、职工文教费等合理办法。
    【北京讯】本市劳动局于十一月二十五日正式批准北京市织染业劳资集体合同。合同的签字和批准大会，在市商会隆重举行，出席大会的除劳资双方代表和该业工会，同业公会的代表百余人之外，中央劳动部，市总工会筹委会，工商业联合会筹委会，市工业局等机关团体都派有代表参加。会上，首先宣读了合同的全文，劳资双方代表一致地鼓掌通过，并依次在合同上签字。劳动局马光斗副局长代表人民政府当场宣布正式批准之后，并在致词中着重指出：这个合同较以前已经签订的四集体合同进了一步，他比较更具体地规定了资方解雇职工的条件，女工在产前产后的假期，及职工文教费等，尤其是采取了计件累进工资制，这对今后的生产发展，具有重大的作用。他希望双方在这个劳资两利具体化的基础上，互尊互让发展生产。劳方代表郭景岩，资方代表万敬书等五人，相继在会上讲了话，都一致保证切实执行合同的规定，把生产搞好；全场并在散会时热烈鼓掌向政府表示敬意。京市织染业劳资集体合同的签订，曾经历多种阻挠和困难。在今年六月间，劳资双方即开始酝酿，草拟合同原稿，经多次的协商讨论，一再修正，到八月间才获致协议。但后因资方内部发生矛盾，以致合同中的部分协议遭受推翻。到十月间资方因迫切需要，又自动向劳动局要求，按原协议进行签订。资方的首席代表万敬书并在劳资代表大会上作了检讨，承认应负延误签订合同的责任。劳动局在详尽的研究了合同的内容之后，向劳资双方提出一些重要的修正意见，如解雇问题的具体规定；把最高工资另订为最低工资；并建议将累进的工资表改作附件，以照顾大小各厂不同的情况等等。经详加说明后，劳资双方都表示：“这对生产有好处”而一致接受。
    这是京市第五个劳资集体合同的签订。此外，京市的窑业、浴堂及手工造纸业，已先后成立临时集体协议，并将根据各业的需要，进行签订正式的集体合同。
