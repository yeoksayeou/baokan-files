　　Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, December 30th dispatch: According to a Batavia dispatch from TASS, the broad masses of the Indonesian people have expressed extreme anger at the collusion between American and Dutch imperialists and the traitorous Hatta clique. Democratic groups believe that the so-called "transfer of sovereignty" to the "United States of Indonesia" by the Netherlands is a conspiracy commonly used by imperialists.
    The Politburo of the Indonesian Communist Party issued a statement exposing the imperialist nature of the "agreements" passed at the "Round Table Conference." The Politburo emphasized that these "agreements" would place heavy shackles on the Indonesian people. The Indonesian Communist Party urged the Indonesian people to mobilize all forces to fight for the complete independence of Indonesia.
    The Dutch Communist newspaper *De Waarheid* emphasized that the so-called "United States of Indonesia" was established at the behest of American monopoly capitalists. Washington has placed Indonesia under American control. The newspaper also published news that the United States is extremely concerned about establishing armed forces in Indonesia to attack the national liberation movement.

　　印尼共产党政治局发表声明
    痛斥“移交主权”阴谋号召人民争取完全独立
    【新华社北京三十日电】据塔斯社海牙二十九日电引巴达维亚消息说：印尼广大人民对美荷帝国主义者与叛徒哈达集团的勾结，表示极大的愤怒。民主团体认为荷兰的所谓“移交主权”给“印尼合众国”，是帝国主义惯用的阴谋。
    印尼共产党政治局曾发表声明，揭露在“圆桌会议”上所通过的“协议”的帝国主义性质。政治局强调说，这些“协议”将使印尼人民戴上沉重的枷琐。印尼共产党敦促印尼人民动员一切力量，来为争取印尼的完全独立而斗争。
    荷共真理报着重指出，所谓“印尼合众国”是在美国垄断资本家授意下成立的。华盛顿使印尼置于美国的控制下。该报并刊载美国极为关心在印尼建立进攻民族解放运动的武装部队的消息。
