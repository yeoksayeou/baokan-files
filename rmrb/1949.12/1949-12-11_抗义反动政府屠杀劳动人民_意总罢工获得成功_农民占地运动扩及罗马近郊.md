　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th. According to a TASS report from Rome: The general strike called by the Italian General Confederation of Labor on December 1st to protest the police massacre of laboring people in Torremaggiore has been successful. A report issued by the press office of the General Confederation of Labor stated: From 10:00 AM to noon on December 1st, all state-owned railway transportation was halted. In larger cities and towns, workers in all industrial enterprises went on strike and expressed their protests in rallies and gatherings. In Milan, Turin, Bologna, Florence, Naples, Bari, Palermo, and other major central cities, transportation was also halted. In Rome, where government authorities and strike-breaking unions particularly opposed the strike, 554 out of 730 trams were out of service. Suburban trains were also at a standstill. In many provinces, shops were closed, and many commercial employees and workers, as well as rural laborers, participated in the strike. The report concluded: "By participating in this strike, the Italian working masses have once again demonstrated their loyalty to the General Confederation of Labor and their determination to stop police violence."
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th. The movement of landless farmers and tenant farmers in Italy to fight for land has expanded to the outskirts of Rome. According to a TASS report on the 8th, 18,000 farmers and agricultural workers near Rome have participated in the movement to occupy the landlords' wasteland. On the 6th, police arrested about sixty farmers who were cultivating wasteland. A report issued by the Rome branch of the Agricultural Workers' Union stated: Farmers in the province of Rome continue to cultivate wasteland. Agricultural workers and landless farmers realize that only through tenacious struggle can they obtain the land that landlords do not cultivate, which by right belongs to the farmers. The union also urged farmers to continue cultivating wasteland.

    【新华社北京十日电】意大利无地农民与雇农争取土地的运动，业已扩及罗马的近郊。据塔斯社八日电报道，罗马附近已有一万八千农民和农业工人参加了占领地主荒地的运动。六日，警察逮捕了约六十名在荒地上耕作的农民。农业工人联合会罗马分会发表的报道称：罗马省的农民继续在荒地上耕作。农业工人和无地农民认识到：只有靠顽强的斗争，才能得到地主们所不耕的，按其权利原是属于农民的土地。该会并力促农民们继续在荒地上耕作。
