Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 8th: The so-called "government" of the remnant Kuomintang bandit gang, having barely escaped from Chongqing to Chengdu, has begun its flight to Taiwan in a state of panic. The Kuomintang bandit gang announced on the 7th that the bandit "government" would be moved to Taipei, and a so-called "headquarters" would be established in Xichang, the capital of Xikang Province, to command the remaining bandit troops in the Southwest to continue their struggle. In reality, even before this order from the bandit gang was announced, the remnant bandits had already begun scrambling to escape, and the Civil Air Transport of the American rogue Claire Chennault was doing extremely brisk business. Agence France-Presse reported on the 5th that many bandit officials were "scrambling to catch planes to Taiwan and Hong Kong. All Civil Air Transport planes have been chartered by the Executive Yuan and are under the direct control of Chiang Kai-shek."

Simultaneous with the repeated escapes of the bandit "government," the ugly drama of Chiang Kai-shek and the Guangxi clique warlords vying for the position of bandit leader continues to unfold. Bandit Chiang is intensifying his efforts to brew a restoration of the bogus "presidency." The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee passed a so-called resolution on the 3rd urging Bandit Chiang's restoration and demanding the resignation of Bandit Li Zongren; Bandit Chiang's henchmen in Taiwan, such as bogus legislators and bogus national representatives, are also joining in the clamor. However, Bandit Li Zongren, who fled to Hong Kong under the pretext of treating a "stomach ailment," has refused to step down. Bandit Li left Hong Kong on the 5th and arrived in the United States on the 7th to engage in activities to sell out the country and seek aid. Before leaving for the United States, Bandit Li cabled Bandit Yan Xishan in Hong Kong, claiming that "major decisions" of the bandit "government" should be discussed with him at any time. On the 4th, Bandit Li declared to American reporters in Hong Kong that "American aid to Kuomintang China should all go through him as 'acting president.'" United Press said: Li Zongren, who is going to the United States, "hopes that American military men will be interested in establishing a Kuomintang army along the southern border of Vietnam." However, only one day after Bandit Li arrived in the United States, the majority of the three bandit corps within Guangxi and Guangdong were annihilated.

　　残匪由成都逃亡台北
  　蒋李二贼争夺匪首地位
  　李匪离港赴美卖国求援
    【新华社北京八日电】才由重庆逃至成都的国民党残余匪帮的所谓“政府”，惊魂未定，又开始逃亡台湾。国民党匪帮已于七日宣布，匪“政府”迁设台北，并在西康省会西昌设立所谓“大本营”，统率西南残余匪军继续挣扎。实际上在匪帮的这个命令宣布以前，残匪即已争先恐后地开始逃命，美国流氓陈纳德的民运航空队生意极为兴旺。法新社五日消息说，许多匪官“争先恐后抢搭飞机到台湾和香港。所有民运航空队飞机都被行政院包下了，并由蒋介石直接支配”。与匪“政府”一再逃亡同时，蒋匪介石和桂系军阀之间争夺匪首地位的丑剧仍在继续发展。蒋匪正在加紧进行酝酿复辟伪“总统”的活动。国民党中常会已于本月三日通过所谓促请蒋匪复辟和要求李匪宗仁下台的决议；蒋匪在台湾的喽罗，伪立委、伪国大代表等也跟着一齐呐喊。但以医治“胃疾”为名跑到香港的李匪宗仁，则拒绝下台。李匪已于本月五日离开香港，并于七日到了美国，进行卖国求援活动。李匪到美国去以前在香港致电阎匪锡山声称匪“政府”“重大决策”都要随时同他“电商”。李匪四日在香港向美国记者宣称：“美国给予国民党中国的援助都应该经过作为‘代总统’的他”。合众社说：前往美国的李宗仁“希望美国军人们对沿越南边境建立一支国民党军队发生兴趣”。但是，在李匪刚刚到达美国的一天，桂粤境内的残匪三个兵团即大部被歼。
