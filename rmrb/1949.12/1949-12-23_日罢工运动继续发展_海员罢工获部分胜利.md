    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 21st: The seamen's strike initiated by the All-Japan Seamen's Union on the 16th ended on the night of the 18th with a partial victory. However, the struggle of most Japanese unions for year-end bonuses and against the low-wage policy of MacArthur Headquarters and the Japanese government continues to develop. According to United Press and Reuters news: After the Japanese seamen went on strike, ships in all major ports of Japan were forced to stop, and shipping traffic was paralyzed as a result. Under these circumstances, the shipping companies had to agree to most of the union's demands for year-end bonuses on the evening of the 18th, that is, an average of 10,100 yen per person. This amount is 2,400 yen lower than the union's original demand.

　　日罢工运动继续发展
    海员罢工获部分胜利
    【新华社北京二十一日电】全日海员工会于十六日发起的海员罢工，已于十八日夜以获得部分胜利而告结束，但大多数日本工会为要求发给年终津贴及反对麦克阿瑟总部与日本政府低工资政策而进行的斗争，仍在继续发展中。据合众社与路透社消息：在日本海员实行罢工后，全日各大港口中的船舶即被迫停驶，航运交通因而陷于瘫痪。航运公司方面在这种情况下，不得不于十八日晚答应工会方面关于年终津贴的大部分要求，即每人平均发年终津贴一万零一百日元。这个数目较工会原来的要求低二千四百日元。
