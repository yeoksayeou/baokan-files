　　North China's Exports Show Buoyant Growth
    Exports in Early December Exceed Total Value of Last Month
    [Tianjin News] Beginning this month, North China's export trade has shown buoyant growth. Due to the appropriate increase in foreign exchange rates this month, the export of most native products is now profitable. Furthermore, because of the large-scale exports of goods by state-owned companies, the value of exported materials in the first ten days of this month alone has exceeded the total export value of the entire previous month, approximately three times the total import value for the same period. Domestic coastal inter-port trade is also very prosperous, with an import-to-export ratio of two to one.
