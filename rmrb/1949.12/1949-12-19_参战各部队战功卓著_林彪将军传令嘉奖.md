Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 18th: Commander Lin Biao of the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army, Deputy Political Commissar and Director of the Political Department Tan Zheng, and Chief of Staff Xiao Ke, have issued a joint order commending all commanders and fighters of the participating units in the Guangxi-Guangdong Campaign, stating:

　　Comrades, commanders, and fighters on the Guangxi and Southern Guangdong Front:

　　(1) We have already won a historically significant victory in the southern routes of Guangxi and Guangdong. In the month-long operation that began on November 7th, the Zhang Gan Corps, Xu Qiming Corps, Lu Daoyuan Corps, Huang Jie Corps, Liu Jiashu Corps, commanded by the bandit Bai Chongxi, and the remnants of Yu Hanmou's forces in Guangdong, have all been annihilated, except for a small number who fled to Hainan Island, the mountainous areas of Guangxi, and French-occupied Vietnam, and a small number who dispersed and are still being mopped up. Our army has captured a great number of prisoners. In one month, our army liberated Guilin, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Nanning, and the entire Guangxi Province, as well as all towns and seaports in the southern part of Guangdong. Except for Hainan Island, the entire area under the jurisdiction of Central South China has now been liberated. The elimination of Bai Chongxi's bandit forces, who were fostered by American imperialism and its running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and regarded as a trump card, constantly providing spiritual and material support to the remaining reactionary forces in the country, is not only of great significance to the subsequent Hainan Island campaign, but also of great significance to the liberation of neighboring provinces and the early end of the war nationwide.

　　(2) In this operation, the Fourth Corps of our Second Field Army and the various corps of the Fourth Field Army cooperated very closely, demonstrating a high degree of unity and fraternal spirit. In the course of large-scale detours, encirclements, and fierce pursuits, our combat troops overcame great mountains, rivers, mud, hunger, and unbearable fatigue with fearless courage, advancing rapidly, causing the enemy to be terrified. Despite their cunning and rapid escape, they were ultimately unable to escape the encirclement of our various units and were completely annihilated. In order to promote the conscious spirit and the spirit of hard work in this operation, I hereby extend my heartfelt greetings and condolences to all commanders, pay my respects to the wounded comrades, and express my condolences to the sacrificed comrades. Their spirit will live forever!

　　Although Bai Chongxi's bandit forces have been eliminated, the bandits and reactionary armed forces entrenched in the countryside still need to be cleared, the remnants who fled overseas still need to be pursued, and Hainan Island still needs to be liberated. After a period of rest, you will have to carry out the above tasks and complete them victoriously. Our victory is great, and the comrades' contributions are also great, but we must not become arrogant or slack off in spirit or practical work because of this. We must know that our tasks are still arduous. Before the final end of the entire war, we must persist in fighting. Once the war is over, we must switch to rectification and training, improve our military and political qualities and culture to a higher degree and in a step-by-step manner, and at the same time develop production to improve the lives of the troops and reduce the burden on the people. Here, we must remember Chairman Mao's valuable instruction that the People's Liberation Army is forever a fighting force, and the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must defend the motherland and forever serve the motherland and the people.

　　参战各部队战功卓著
  　林彪将军传令嘉奖
    【新华社华南前线十八日电】人民解放军第四野战军司令员林彪，副政治委员兼政治部主任谭政，参谋长萧克顷通令嘉奖桂粤战役各参战部队全体指挥员战斗员称：
    广西及粤南前线全体指战员同志们：
    （一）我们在广西、广东的南路，业已赢得了具有历史意义的胜利。从十一月七日开始以来为期一个月的作战，为白崇禧匪部所指挥的张淦兵团、徐启明兵团、鲁道源兵团、黄杰兵团、刘嘉树兵团及广东残敌余汉谋所部，除一小部逃往海南岛、广西山地和越南法国占领区，一小部溃散尚待肃清者外，业已全部被我歼灭。我军俘获甚大，一个月时间我军解放了桂桂林、柳州、梧州、南宁和广西全境，及广东南路各城镇和全部海港，华中南所辖范围除海南岛一隅外，至此业已全部解放。为美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派所豢养并奉为王牌，在全国残余反动势力中经常在精神上，实力上起支持作用的白匪部队之被消灭，不但对以后的海南岛作战有着重要意义，即对邻省的解放和在全国范围内提早结束战争，亦具有重大意义。
    （二）这次作战中，我第二野战军第四兵团与第四野战军各兵团协同甚为密切，高度地表现了团结友爱的精神。我各作战部队在进行大的迂回、包围和猛追、穷追的行动中，皆以奋不顾身的勇气，战胜了大山、河流、泥泞、饥饿和难以忍受的疲乏，神速前进，使敌人闻风丧胆，尽管他们狡猾，并逃得那样的快，但始终无法逃出我军各部的包围圈，而于最后悉数被歼。为着发扬这次作战的自觉精神和艰苦精神，特向我各部指点员致亲切的慰问一慰劳，向受伤的同志致敬意，向牺牲的同志表示吊唁，他们的精神永垂不朽！
    白崇禧匪部被消灭了但盘据乡村的土匪反动武装尚待肃清，逃往海外的残敌尚待追捕，海南岛尚待解放，在休息一个时期之后，你们即须执行上项任务，并胜利地来完成它。我们的胜利是很大的，同志们的功劳也是很大的，但是决不可因此发生骄傲或在精神上、实际工作上松弛懈怠起来。须知我们的任务仍然是艰巨的，在战争全部最后结束以前，我们必须坚持作战，而在战争一经结束，我们即须转入整训，更高地、有步聚地提高我军军事与政治素质，提高文化，同时发展生产，以改善部队的生活与减轻人民负担。这里必须记着毛主席宝贵的指示，人民解放军永远是战斗队，人民解放军的指战员必须捍卫祖国、永远为祖国、为人民服务。
