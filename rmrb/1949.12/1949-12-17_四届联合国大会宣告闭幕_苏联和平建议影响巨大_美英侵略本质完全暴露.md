Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 15th: The Fourth United Nations General Assembly, which opened at Lake Success, New York, on September 20th, concluded on December 11th after 83 days. This session of the General Assembly took place under circumstances where, on the one hand, the people's democratic and peaceful forces were unprecedentedly surging, and on the other hand, the danger of US-British policies of preparing for a new war was becoming increasingly apparent. The struggle that took place at the assembly fully reflected this general situation.

　　During the UN General Assembly, the founding of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union's announcement that it possessed atomic weapons, and the worldwide demonstration on October 2nd to defend peace—this series of historical events unprecedentedly strengthened the world's democratic and peaceful camp and also powerfully weakened and disrupted the imperialist camp that was preparing for a new war. Therefore, the US-British bloc more frantically gathered a "majority" within the United Nations that would submit to its will to obstruct the passage of all proposals that would safeguard world peace, security, international friendship, and cooperation, attempting to further transform the United Nations into a rubber-stamp organ for approving its aggressive acts.

　　The central struggle of this General Assembly was the Soviet proposal to "condemn preparations for a new war, prohibit atomic weapons and control atomic energy, and have the five major powers conclude a pact to strengthen peace." This proposal conformed to the interests and demands of the people of the world, but the warmongering bloc headed by US imperialism stubbornly rejected it.

　　Relying on its voting machine "majority," US-British imperialists attempted to use the United Nations to slander the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries. During this General Assembly, the Kuomintang bandit gang representatives staged a farcical show to defame the Soviet Union, claiming a so-called "threat to the independence and territorial integrity of China and to peace in the Far East," as well as the US, Canada, and Bolivia defaming Poland, Romania, and Hungary for "violating treaties and infringing on human rights and basic freedoms."

　　The criminal activities of the US-British voting machine were also manifested in the following many voting cases: the Soviet proposal advocating the prohibition of atomic weapons and the control of atomic energy was rejected, while the French-Canadian proposal for the six permanent countries of the Atomic Energy Commission to continue fruitless consultations was passed; the Soviet proposal to guarantee the former Italian colonies to obtain independence was rejected, while the proposal that was actually a joint division of these colonies by the US, Britain, and France was passed; the Soviet proposal requesting Greece to end its civil war and for the Greek government to announce a general amnesty was rejected, while the joint US, British, Australian, and Kuomintang proposal that condoned the Greek royalist fascist government's massacre of the people and covered up its aggression against Bulgaria and Albania was passed; the Soviet proposal demanding an end to the illegal interference in the internal affairs of Korea and the dissolution of the illegal "Korean Commission" was rejected, while the US proposal to extend this illegal committee indefinitely and expand its powers was passed; the Ukrainian proposal demanding that the Dutch troops invading Indonesia withdraw to their original positions before December of last year, stop persecuting the Indonesian people, and have the Security Council be responsible for drafting a plan to resolve the Dutch-Indonesian conflict was rejected, while the so-called "welcoming The Hague Agreement" fourteen-nation proposal was passed; the Soviet proposal demanding that the United Nations collect complete intelligence on all armaments, including atomic weapons, in order to implement the prohibition of atomic weapons and reduce the armaments and armed forces of the permanent members of the Security Council by one-third was rejected, while the French-Norwegian proposal advocating only investigating armaments other than atomic weapons was passed; the Soviet compromise proposal demanding the simultaneous admission to the United Nations of all thirteen countries, including Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Mongolia, Italy, Portugal, Finland, Austria, Ceylon, Ireland, Nepal, and Transjordan, was rejected, while the Australian proposal demanding that the Security Council re-examine the applications of countries other than the people's democratic countries and the South Korean puppet government was passed. In addition, the General Assembly, in violation of the UN Charter, elected the Tito bandit gang government, which are murderers and spies, as a non-permanent member of the Security Council; in violation of the Second UN General Assembly's decision of November 1947 regarding the administration of Jerusalem by the Trusteeship Council, it passed the so-called internationalization plan that was in fact a split of Jerusalem by Transjordan and Israel; in violation of the UN Charter, it passed the illegal resolution on the indefinite existence of the so-called "Interim Committee" (i.e., the Little Assembly) and the illegal resolutions on the establishment of the so-called "Field Service" and "Field Observer Reserve" under the UN Secretariat, which are purely military organizations.

　　All this series of shameful records once again shows that the US-British imperialist bloc is determined to continue its crazy policy of preparing for a new war, to continue its evil policies of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, attacking colonial peoples, pursuing atomic warmongering, undermining the UN Charter, and especially abolishing the Security Council's role in maintaining world peace and security. Therefore, as this General Assembly was about to end, Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky solemnly stated: "The results of the General Assembly are unsatisfactory, and the cause of peace has suffered a serious blow as a result."

　　However, the actions of the US-British bloc's voting machine cannot in any way offset the great efforts made by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries for peace at the UN General Assembly and their great influence. From the struggle between the two camps within the United Nations, the people of the world have further recognized the aggressive nature of the US-British war-mongers and the firm stance of the Soviet Union in fighting for peace. The actual balance of power between the democratic camp and the imperialist camp is developing in the opposite direction to the UN General Assembly's voting machine. As an observer for Izvestia pointed out: "The Soviet Union's courageous call for peace at the UN General Assembly has been powerfully responded to by all sincere supporters of peace and has given them new strength. A powerful mass movement to defend peace is developing in all countries. All fighters for lasting peace and international security will unite around the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation at the Fourth UN General Assembly aimed at consolidating peace."

### 四届联合国大会宣告闭幕  苏联和平建议影响巨大　美英侵略本质完全暴露

　　四届联合国大会宣告闭幕
    苏联和平建议影响巨大
  　美英侵略本质完全暴露
    【新华社北京十五日电】九月二十日在纽约成功湖开幕的第四届联合国大会，历时八十三日，已于十二月十一日宣告闭幕。本届大会是在一方面人民民主和平力量空前高涨，另一方面美英准备新战争政策的危险性日益显明的情况下进行的。大会上进行的斗争，充分地反映了这一总的形势。
    在联合国大会开会期间，中华人民共和国与德意志民主共和国的成立，苏联宣布握有原子武器与十月二日全世界保卫和平的大示威，这一连串历史性事件空前壮大了世界民主和平阵营，也有力地削弱并打乱了正在准备新战争的帝国主义阵营。因此美英集团更疯狂地纠合在联合国内顺从其意志的“多数”，来阻挠通过一切维护世界和平安全国际友好合作的提案，企图进一步变联合国为批准其侵略行为的盖印机关。
    作为本届联大斗争中心的是苏联关于“谴责新战争准备、禁用原子武器并管制原子能、五强缔结加强和平公约”的提案，这个提案符合于全世界人民的利益和要求，但以美帝国主义为首的战争贩子集团、却顽固地加以拒绝。
    美英帝国主义者凭借其表决机器的“多数”，企图通过联合国来污蔑苏联、中华人民共和国与人民民主国家。在本届大会中，曾演出国民党匪帮代表诽谤苏联的所谓“对中国独立与领土完整及远东和平之威胁”，与美、加、玻（璃维亚）诽谤保、罗、匈三国“违反和约侵犯人权与基本自由”的滑稽丑剧。
    美英表决机器的罪恶活动，也表现在下列的许多表决案上：否决了主张禁用原子武器与管制原子能的苏联提案，而通过了由原子能委员会六常任国家继续作无结果协商的法、加提案；否决了保障前意大利殖民地取得独立的苏联提案，而通过了实际上是由美、英、法共同瓜分这些殖民地的提案；否决了要求希腊停止内战、并由希腊政府宣布大赦的苏联提案，而通过了纵容希腊保皇法西斯政府残杀人民与掩饰其对保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚进行侵略的美、英、澳、国民党联合提案；否决了要求结束对朝鲜内政的非法干涉、解散非法的“朝鲜委员会”的苏联提案，而通过了无限期延长这一非法委员会、并扩大其职权的美国提案；否决了乌克兰要求荷兰进攻印尼的军队撤回至去年十二月以前的原阵地、停止迫害印尼人民、并由安理会负责草拟解决荷印冲突计划的提案，而通过了所谓“欢迎海牙协议”的十四国提案；否决了要求联合国收集关于一切军备包括原子武器在内的完整情报、以实施禁止原子武器并裁减安理会常任理事国军备与武装部队三分之一的苏联提案，而通过了主张只对原子武器以外的军备进行调查的法挪提案；否决了要求全部批准阿（尔巴尼亚）、保、罗、匈、蒙、意、葡、芬、奥、锡（兰）、爱（尔兰）、尼（泊尔）、外（约但）等十三国同时加入联合国的苏联折衷提案，而通过了要求安理会重行审查除人民民主国家以外各国暨南朝鲜傀儡政府的申请的澳大利亚提案。此外，大会违反联合国宪章，选举了杀人犯和间谍的铁托匪帮政府为安全理事会的非常任理事国；违反二届联大于一九四七年十一月间关于由托管理事会管理耶路撒冷的决定，通过了事实上由外约但与以色列割裂耶路撒冷的所谓国际化方案；违背联合国宪章，通过了所谓“临时委员会”（即小型大会）无限期存在的非法决议以及在联合国秘书处之下成立纯粹军事组织性质的所谓“外勤队”和“外勤观察员后备队”的非法决议等等。
    所有这一连串可耻的记录，再一次显示美英帝国主义集团决心继续其进行新战争准备的疯狂政策，继续其干涉他国内政、进攻殖民地人民、奉行原子黩武主义、破坏联合国宪章、特别是取消安理会维护世界和平安全的作用的罪恶政策。所以，当本届大会将告结束时，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基严正表示：“大会的结果是不能令人满意的，和平事业因此遭受了严重的打击。”
    但是美英集团表决机器的动作，丝毫也不能抵消苏联与人民民主国家在联合国大会上为和平所作的伟大努力及其伟大影响。全世界人民从联合国内两个阵营的斗争中，进一步认清了美英战贩的侵略本质与苏联为和平而斗争的坚定立场。民主阵营与帝国主义阵营间实际力量的对比，正朝着与联大表决机器相反的方向发展。正如消息报观察家所指出：“苏联在联大保卫和平的勇敢呼吁，已得到所有和平的真诚拥护者的有力响应，并使他们得到了新的力量，强大的拥护和平的群众运动正在各国发展着。一切争取持久和平与国际安全的战士，都将团结在苏联代表团在四届联大所提出的旨在巩固和平的建议的周围。”
