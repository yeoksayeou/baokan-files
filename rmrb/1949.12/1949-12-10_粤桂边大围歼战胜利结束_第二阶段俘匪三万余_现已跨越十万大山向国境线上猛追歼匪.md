Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 9th: The great encirclement and annihilation campaign on the Guangdong-Guangxi border to eliminate the Gui clique bandit army victoriously concluded on the 8th. In the second phase of the encirclement and annihilation campaign (from the 2nd to the 8th), centered on Qin County, the People's Liberation Army annihilated most of the bandit "Central China Military and Political Office" direct units, the entire 125th Army, and parts of the 46th and 56th Armies under the 10th Corps, capturing over 30,000 bandits.

Since the end of the first phase of the encirclement and annihilation campaign, after the main force of the bandit army was annihilated, Bai Chongxi hurriedly ordered his "Central China Military and Political Office," 1st Corps, 10th Corps, and 11th Corps remnants to retreat rapidly from Nanning and various parts of the Guangdong-Guangxi border to Qin County. At that time, our South and East Route armies, after a large-scale annihilation of the enemy in the Bobai and Lianjiang areas, advanced rapidly despite all fatigue; while our Central Route army also marched south from Guilin and Liuzhou at full speed, and our West Route army went directly to Nanning, forming a heavy interception net, pursuing the fleeing enemy from multiple directions. All the Gui clique remnants fell into our net.

Our South Route army first captured the coastal cities of Hepu and Beihai from the 3rd to the 5th, and annihilated over 4,000 remnants of Yu Hanmou's bandit 23rd Army during the advance; then, taking advantage of the victory, crossed the Qin River to the west, advanced parallel to the fleeing bandits, and went straight to Qin County, the last sea outlet the bandit army attempted to rely on to escape, and captured the city in one fell swoop on the morning of the 7th, completely annihilating a part of the bandit "Central China Military and Political Office" direct units that had fled from Nanning and gathered there, including three artillery regiments, two engineering regiments, two security regiments, one guard regiment, and one replenishment regiment, capturing over 10,000 enemies and seizing vehicles, heavy artillery, and a large amount of supplies.

Our East Route army, which had come south from Wuzhou, captured Lingshan on the 5th, and on the same day intercepted the bandit 125th Army fleeing from the northeast direction in the Pingnan Market area northwest of the county. After ten hours of fierce fighting, it completely eliminated it, capturing bandit army commander Chen Kairong, 183rd Division Commander Wang Guanglun, Deputy Division Commander Yang Xingguo, Acting Chief of Staff Duan Yuantti, 362nd Division Commander Chen Shaohuan, Chief of Staff Bao Deying, Provisional 2nd Division Commander Yang Youqi, and nearly 10,000 others.

Our Central Route army occupied Heng County on the 4th, and after crossing the Yu River to the south, caught up with the rearguard 236th Division of the fleeing bandit 10th Corps in the area west of Lingshan on the 6th, annihilating over 1,000 bandits.

At this time, our Central, East, and South Route armies converged in the area west of Lingshan. Fraternal units cooperated with each other to completely annihilate the remnants of the fleeing bandit 11th Corps' 46th Army and parts of the bandit Ministry of National Defense Assault Detachment 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Companies, and the 3rd Column of the Traffic Police Headquarters, in the Xiaodong Market area north of Qinzhou, capturing over 10,000 bandits.

The remaining bandit army that fled to the west of Qin County was intercepted by our West Route army that went south from Nanning along the Yong (Nanning) Qin (County) road. On the 6th, our army first annihilated the remnants of the bandit 11th Corps headquarters and most of the 87th Division of the 71st Army in the Datang Market northwest of Qin County, and on the 7th annihilated a part of the bandit 56th Army in the Naxiao Market. At this point, the second phase of the encirclement and annihilation campaign came to a victorious conclusion. Our army has now crossed the Shiwan Mountain Range and is fiercely pursuing the few escaped bandits towards the border line of Mingjiang, Sile, and Longzhou. A part of the bandit army that was defeated on the Guangdong-Guangxi border and gathered in the Wuxuan area is also being surrounded and suppressed by us.

　　粤桂边大围歼战胜利结束
  　第二阶段俘匪三万余
    现已跨越十万大山向国境线上猛追歼匪
    【新华社华南前线九日电】歼灭桂系匪军的粤桂边大围歼战已于八日胜利结束。人民解放军在围歼战第二阶段（二日至八日）以钦县为中心的作战中，歼灭匪“华中军政长官公署”直属队大部，一二五军全部及十兵团所辖之四十六军、五十六军各一部，俘匪三万余名。
    自围歼战第一阶段结束、匪军主力被歼后，白匪崇禧慌忙命令其“华中军政长官公署”、一兵团、十兵团及十一兵团等残部分由南宁以及粤桂边各地迅速向钦县撤退。是时，我南路及东路大军于博白、廉江地区大规模歼敌后，不顾一切疲劳，乘胜疾进；而我中路大军亦自桂林、柳州间兼程南下，我西路大军则直取南宁，布成重重之拦截网，多路追击逃敌。桂系残匪全部入我网罗。
    我南路大军首于三日至五日连克滨海城市合浦及北海市，并在前进途中歼灭余汉谋匪部二十三军残部四千余；随即乘胜西渡钦江，与逃匪平行前进，直奔匪军企图赖以脱逃的最后海口钦县，并于七日晨一举攻占该城，将由南宁逃集该地的匪“华中军政长官公署”直属队一部全部歼灭，计有三个炮兵团、两个工兵团、两个保安团、一个警卫团、一个补充团，共俘敌万余，缴获汽车、重炮、及大批物资。
    我自梧州南下的东路大军则于五日攻占灵山，同日又在该县西北之平南墟地区截获自东北方向逃来的匪一二五军，经十小时激战，全部将其消灭，俘匪军长陈开荣，一八三师师长王光伦、副师长杨兴国、代理参谋长段元悌，三六二师师长陈绍桓、参谋长鲍德英，暂二师师长杨又齐等以下近万人。
    我中路大军则于四日占领横县，南渡郁江后，六日在灵山以西地区追及逃匪十兵团的后卫四十六军二三六师，歼匪千余。
    此时，我中、东、南三路大军遂于灵山以西地区会师，各兄弟部队相互协同在钦州以北之小董圩一带，将逃匪十一兵团残部四十六军及匪国防部突击总队一、二、三中队，交通警察总队第三纵队各一部悉数聚歼，俘匪亦达万余名。
    其余逃到钦县以西的匪军，则遭我由南宁沿邕（宁）钦（县）南下之西路大军截击。我军六日首于钦县西北之大塘墟歼灭匪十一兵团部残部及七十一军八十七师大部，七日又于那晓墟歼匪五十六军一部。至此，围歼战第二阶段乃告胜利结束。现我军已越过十万大山，向明江、思乐、龙州一带国境线上猛追少数漏网之匪。在粤桂边境被击溃后流集武宣地区的匪军一部，亦正被我包围清剿中。
