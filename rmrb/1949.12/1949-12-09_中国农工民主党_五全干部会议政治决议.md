Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 8th: Political Resolution of the Fifth National Cadre Conference of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party

From November 14th to November 26th, 1949, the Fifth National Cadre Conference of our party convened in the people's capital – Beijing. It listened to Comrade Zhang Bojun's political report, summarized the experiences and lessons learned from the party's work nationwide, and consequently, made the following decisions as the guiding principles for the entire party's actions in the future.

	I. The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the working class and the staunch leader of the Chinese people's democratic revolutionary front. It guarantees the inevitable victory of the New Democratic Revolution on the path to the realization of Socialism and Communism. Therefore, this conference unanimously decided: to accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China, to unite under the banner of Mao Zedong, to learn from the Communist Party of China, and to complete the historical mission of our party.

	II. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the only correct guiding ideologies for the Chinese revolution. Accept Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as our party's basic educational policy for the future. We must educate all party comrades with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, we must educate all party comrades with proletarian internationalist thought, immediately launch a high tide of learning within the party, resolutely struggle against the remnants of capitalist and feudalist thought, especially individualism, constantly learn from workers and peasants in practical life, cultivate a labor perspective, to carry out self-education, and establish a revolutionary outlook on life that is loyal to serving the people and a pragmatic style.

	III. The Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference not only includes the basic political propositions of our party announced by Comrade Zheng Yanda, as well as the main points of the program's policies, but is also more specific, richer, and more forward-looking, meeting the unanimous demands of the people nationwide. The socialist ideals that our party has always advocated will gain a foundation for realization through the implementation of the Common Program. Therefore, we will take the Common Program as our party's program of action and strive for its thorough implementation.

	IV. The Chinese people, on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance, united under the leadership of the Chinese working class and the Chinese Communist Party, have formed a strong people's democratic united front, have already achieved the basic victory of the revolution, and will more thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of domestic imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, complete land reform, and victoriously implement the construction of a new democratic country. Our party has always supported this people's democratic united front, has persistently struggled for its development and consolidation, and should make even greater efforts in the future. We should continue to strengthen ties and friendly cooperation with other democratic parties, from the central to the local level. In particular, we should, in accordance with our consistent policy, respect the friendship forged through years of shared adversity with the Democratic League, and strengthen cooperation with the Democratic League on the basis of progress and unity.

	V. As Chinese history enters a new era, and Chinese society embarks on a world-shaking transformation, in order to complete new political tasks, our party must and inevitably will undergo qualitative changes. This change must be achieved through self-education and the improvement of class consciousness. Therefore, as the general guideline for the party's organizational tasks, is to unite all party comrades on the basis of progress, conduct criticism and self-criticism ideologically and in life, in order to victoriously embark on a glorious future.

Therefore, the conference made the following more specific decisions:

	1. Stop recruiting party members to expand the organization, continue to earnestly carry out the reorganization of party affairs nationwide, and strictly enforce the discipline of the party's political education.

	2. Concentrate efforts to strengthen the education of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and internationalist thought, to establish a system of learning within the party.

	3. Strengthen the study of criticism and self-criticism within the party, so that all party comrades can correctly, universally, and profoundly apply this weapon of Marxism-Leninism, to establish a system of self-criticism.

	4. Workers, peasants, youth, student party members, and all mass organizations of workers, peasants, and students led by the party, should immediately encourage and help them to separately participate in national unified leadership organizations such as trade unions, peasant associations, and youth and student groups, accept unified leadership, abide by all regulations of group life, and cease party organizational relations.

	5. Encourage and help party members to join the Chinese Communist Party or the Democratic League, and try to introduce party members to work in various government organs and study in schools.

	6. All former party members who have interrupted their organizational relations for some reason, and who have no major acts that violate the interests of the people, and who today have the awareness and determination to serve the people, the party, on the principle of transformation and unity, is willing to accept their request to restore party membership, but must first undergo a serious and thorough investigation, and after the event, must be given strict education and transformation, and should be handled uniformly by the central government.

	7. Streamline and improve the central and local leading organs, strengthen the application of democratic centralism, and give full play to a proactive and responsible leadership role.

    【新华社北京八日电】中国农工民主党第五次全国干部会议政治决议
    一九四九年十一月十四日至十一月二十六日，本党第五次全国干部会议集会于人民的首都——北京，听取了章伯钧同志的政治报告，总结了全国党务工作的经验与教训，因而，作了以下的决定，以为今后全党的行动方针。
    一、中国共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，是中国人民民主革命阵线上的坚强领导者，它保证着新民主主义革命必然胜利的走上社会主义共产主义的实现，因此，本届大会一致决定：接受中国共产党的领导，团结在毛泽东旗帜下，向中国共产党学习，完成本党的历史任务。
    二、马列主义、毛泽东思想是中国革命的唯一正确的指导思想，接受马列主义、毛泽东思想作为我党今后基本的教育方针。我们必须以马列主义、毛泽东思想教育全党同志，必须以无产阶级的国际主义思想教育全党同志，立刻在党内展开学习的高潮，坚决地和资本主义的封建主义的思想残余，特别是个人主义进行斗争，经常在实际生活中，向工农学习，培养劳动观点，以进行自我教育，并确立为人民忠城服务的革命人生观和实事求是的作风。
    三、人民政协的共同纲领，不仅包括了郑演达同志所宣布的本党基本政治主张，以及纲领政策的要点，而且更具体，更丰富，更向前发展，切合于全国人民的一致要求。我党一向所主张的社会主义理想，将由共同纲令领的实施而获得实现的基础，因此，我们即以共同纲领为本党的行动纲领，为其彻底实现而奋斗。
    四、中国人民在工农联盟的基础上，在中国工人阶级及中国共产党的领导下团结起来，结成了坚强的人民民主统一战线，已经取得了革命的基本胜利，更将彻底地肃清国内帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的残余势力，完成土地改革，以至胜利地实行新民主主义国家的建设。本党是一向拥护和支持这一人民民主统一战线的，曾为其发展和巩固而坚持奋斗，今后自应更加努力，对于各民主党派，自中央到地方都要继续加强联系，友好合作；特别是对民主同盟，应本一贯的方针，尊重多年来患难与共的友爱，在进步和团结的基础上，加强与民盟的合作。
    五、在中国历史进入了新时代，在中国社会走上了翻天覆地的变革过程中，为着完成新的政治任务，本党必须而且必然的发生质的变化，这一变化一定是要通过自我教育及阶级觉悟的提高，因此，作为党的组织任务的总方针，就是在进步的基础上，将全党同志团结起来，从思想上生活上进行批评与自我批评，以期胜利地走上光荣的前途。
    因此，大会更具体的作了以下的决定：
    １、停止吸收党员发展组织，继续切实进行全国党务的整理，严格执行党的政治教育的纪律。
    ２、集中精力加强马列主义、毛泽东思想、国际主义思想的教育，以建立党内学习的制度。
    ３、加强党内批评和自我批评的学习，使全党同志能正确地普遍而又深刻地运用这一马列主义的武器，以建立自我批评制度。
    ４、工人、农民、青年、学生的党员以及党所领导的工农学生的一切的群众组织，应立即鼓励和帮助他们分别参加工会、农会、青年学生团体等全国的统一领导组织，接受统一领导，遵守团体生活的一切规定，停止党的组织关系。
    ５、鼓励和帮助党员参加中国共产党或民盟，并设法介绍党员参加各机关工作及学校学习。
    ６、所有曾经参加本党的党员，因故中断了组织关系，而无重大的违反人民利益行为，在今日有为人民服务的觉悟与决心者，党对于这些人在改造和团结的原则上，愿意接受他们恢复党籍的要求，但事先必须经过认真周密的调查，事后必须予以严格的教育改造，而且应由中央统一办理。
    ７、紧缩并健全中央及各地方领导机构，加强民主集中制的运用，发挥积极的负责的领导作用。
