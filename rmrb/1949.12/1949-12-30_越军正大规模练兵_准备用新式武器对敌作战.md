　　Vietnamese Army is Conducting Large-Scale Training
　　Preparing to Fight the Enemy with New Weapons
　　1950 will be a year of victory. President Ho Chi Minh once told everyone: "The spring of 1950 will be the spring of Vietnam's victory." But he warned: "Victory will not come by itself. We should not wait, but work hard to win victory."
　　In the defensive stage, we could only train and maintain 10,000 regular troops and three times as many guerrillas. Today, we are training a military force ten to thirty times larger than that, such a force is a prerequisite for launching a completely victorious counter-offensive against the French aggressors aided by imperialism. Four years ago, our soldiers only learned to use rifles and light machine guns. Today, they must be familiar with howitzers, and even learn to drive armored vehicles and tanks. We must also deal with the death throes of the mortally wounded and now struggling imperialist beasts. We should not ignore the world's reactionary camp, they will never just accept defeat.
　　However, in any case, we are on the uphill path, while French imperialism is on the downhill path. In view of the rapid improvement of the domestic and international situation, the spring of 1950 will mark a turning point in our war of liberation, perhaps the final turning point.

### 越军正大规模练兵　准备用新式武器对敌作战

　　越军正大规模练兵
　  准备用新式武器对敌作战
    一九五○年是胜利的一年。胡志明主席曾告诉大家说：“一九五○年的春天是越南胜利的春天。”但是他警告说：“胜利是不会自己到来的。我们不应等待，而要艰苦奋斗去赢得胜利。
    在防御的阶段，我们只能训练和维持一万正规军和三倍那样多的游击队。今天，我们正训练一支比那时大十倍至三十倍的军事力量，这样一支兵力是对帝国主义所援助的法国侵略者发动完全胜利的反攻的先决条件。四年以前，我们的士兵只学会使用步枪和轻机枪，今天，他们必须熟悉榴弹炮，甚至还要学习驾驶装甲车和坦克。我们还要对付受了致命伤而现在处于困境的帝国主义野兽的垂死挣扎，我们不应忽视世界反动阵营，他们是决不失败了就算的。
    但是，无论怎样，我们正走着上坡路，而法帝国主义正走着下坡路。鉴于国内外形势的迅速好转，一九五○年的春天，将标志着我们解放战争中的转折点，这或许是最后的一个转折点。
