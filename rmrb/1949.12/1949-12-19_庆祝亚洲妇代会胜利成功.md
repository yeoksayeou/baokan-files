　　Zhang Xiaomei's Opening Speech

　　[Beijing News] Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, delivered the following opening speech at the Beijing Municipal Conference celebrating the successful conclusion of the Asian Women's Conference yesterday (18th): Dear delegates from various countries, dear guests:

　　All two million men, women, and children in Beijing are celebrating the successful conclusion of the Asian Women's Representative Conference with incomparable joy and excitement. You have worked hard at the six-day conference, and we would like to extend our warm greetings and sincere regards to you. Delegates, your conference has victoriously completed a great historical task—uniting women from Asian and other countries around the world, and announcing to the world our common will and hopes. Your work will be written in history, and our descendants will remember you forever!

　　The Asian Women's Representative Conference is a victorious gathering of warriors from all countries fighting for democracy and peace; this conference has more powerfully told the world: Women throughout Asia are united! This conference has strengthened and consolidated the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp, and has greatly struck a blow to the forces of imperialism; moreover, due to the victory of the Chinese people, the US imperialism's conspiracy to use China as a major base to enslave the people of Asia and attack the Soviet Union has completely failed. Therefore, millions upon millions of people around the world are encouraged and cheered by this conference; on the contrary, the imperialists and their running dogs are frightened and trembling because of this conference, because they know: the victory of the people is the failure of imperialism, and they know even more that they are not far from the grave.

　　We sincerely thank the International Democratic Women's Federation for deciding to hold this conference in China. Holding the conference in China has given our Chinese women, especially Beijing women, a good opportunity to participate. During the conference, we learned a lot, and we deeply appreciated the greatness of internationalism. At the same time, we deeply realized that the struggle for lasting peace and people's democracy, the struggle for women's liberation, and the struggle for a happy future for our children have no national boundaries. Our struggles support and encourage each other. The glorious achievements of our Soviet sisters have pointed out the bright road to happiness for women all over the world!

　　Today, the Chinese people's revolution has been victorious. The experience of victory tells us: without the existence and help of the great Soviet Union, without the victory of the various new democratic countries, without the upsurge of the liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and without the development of the people's democratic struggles within the imperialist countries, the victory of the Chinese people would have been impossible. You believe that China's victory is also your victory, and we also believe that the liberation cause of all nations and the cause of striving for people's democracy and lasting peace are also our cause. Only when these causes have won victory on a global scale will our task be finally completed.

　　Dear sisters! The epoch-making Asian Women's Representative Conference has successfully concluded. Holding this conference in China is the glory of our People's Republic of China, and it is also the supreme glory of Chinese women, especially Beijing women. This is the result of the great victory of the Chinese revolution. I would like to state once again that this victory is inseparable from the struggle of sisters from all countries against imperialism and domestic reactionaries.

　　Now, you are about to return. We warmly send you off and hope that our sisters from various countries will often visit China. When you return to your motherland, please convey our Chinese people's lofty respect and cordial greetings to your people and your people's leaders. Let us unite more closely in the struggle to completely eliminate imperialism and strive for peace and victory!

　　Celebrate the successful conclusion of the Asian Women's Representative Conference!
　　Women of Asia unite!
　　Women of the world unite!
　　Down with imperialism!
　　Defend world peace!
　　Defend people's democracy!
　　Long live the liberation of oppressed nations!
　　Long live the International Democratic Women's Federation!
　　Long live Comrade Stalin, the great teacher of mankind!
　　Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!

　　Full Text of Mayor Nie's Speech

　　[Beijing News] The following is the full text of the speech delivered by Nie Rongzhen, Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, at the Beijing Municipal Conference celebrating the successful conclusion of the Asian Women's Conference: Distinguished delegates, distinguished guests, fellow compatriots in Beijing:

　　We are deeply honored that the Asian Women's Representative Conference was held in Beijing, the capital of China. Now that the conference has successfully concluded, we warmly congratulate the success of the Asian Women's Representative Conference!

　　The delegates to the Asian Women's Representative Conference came from various countries in Asia, and the guests to the Asian Women's Representative Conference came from various countries in Europe, America, and Africa outside Asia. This represents the great international unity of women, which means our great strength to fight against our common enemy, imperialism. China has been liberated from the struggle against feudalism and imperialism, and the various nations of Asia are fighting heroically for their own liberation. We believe that they, like the Chinese people, will be liberated from the enslavement of imperialism. I would like to pay tribute to the Asian people who are fighting heroically for national liberation!

　　We believe that the liberation of women is inseparable from the liberation of the entire nation, and at the same time, the revolutionary force cannot exclude the power of women. We remember and cannot forget that countless outstanding women heroes emerged in the worldwide anti-fascist war. They fought shoulder to shoulder with men on all fronts. They contributed everything to win the victory of this great struggle. Exemplary figures like Tanya from the Soviet Union are well known. The great victory we won against fascism is inseparable from the struggle and efforts of progressive women all over the world. The same is true in China. In the more than 20 years of the people's revolutionary struggle, many mothers of soldiers and women model workers on various fronts have emerged, and they have gained liberation from the victory of the revolution.

　　At the same time, we are also clear that the victory of the Chinese revolution would not have been possible without international assistance. It was precisely because of the struggle and efforts of the people of the world, including women, and especially the Soviet people, that the victory of the anti-fascist war was achieved, which made China's victory possible. The head of the fierce beast of imperialism is being held back in the West by the powerful Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, which has enabled China to cut off one of its feet in the East. And China's victory will greatly encourage the courage of the oppressed people and oppressed nations of all countries to fight. This is the international significance of the victory of the Chinese revolution. For Asia, this is even more important and obvious. This shows that our struggle today must have an international united front, and the same is true for the women's movement.

　　Imperialism is not reconciled to its own death. It is always trying to provoke new wars. We must mobilize all Asian women and women all over the world to stop this war. If imperialism insists on war, women will never allow imperialism to send their husbands and sons to the battlefield to kill their brothers. At the same time, women will organize their husbands and sons to fight to the death against imperialism and its running dogs in various countries. Women are heroic warriors in defending lasting world peace, and victory will surely belong to progressive mankind all over the world.

　　Long live the success of the Asian Women's Representative Conference!

　　Full Text of Mrs. Kuhrig's Speech

　　[Beijing News] The following is the full text of the speech delivered by Mrs. Kuhrig at the Beijing Municipal Conference celebrating the successful conclusion of the Asian Women's Representative Conference:

　　Dear friends: I now extend my respects to you on behalf of 80 million women from 59 member countries of the International Democratic Women's Federation. Women all over the world are following your progress; they place infinite hope on the great victory achieved by the Chinese people.

　　The Asian Women's Representative Conference has now concluded, and it has strengthened our ties. It has not only strengthened the unity of women representing 23 countries in this conference, but also united some women within the member countries of the International Women's Federation who are concerned about our work.

　　The struggle for national independence is the common task of oppressed women on all continents, because they are subject to the same oppression by imperialism.

　　Our conference pointed out that the peace camp has no geographical boundaries. This camp includes all women who love peace and fight for peace. There are women who are with their governments, such as the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the current China; there are women who oppose the warmongers—imperialism.

　　Therefore, our conference can be said to have brought together progressive women from the Soviet Union, New China, Korea, Mongolia, Czechoslovakia, Vietnam, and imperialist countries. We have jointly made a decision to strengthen our struggle to realize all the action programs decided by the World Peace Congress and recently adopted by the Executive Committee of the Democratic Women's Federation in Moscow.

　　We must use all our strength to oppose the colonial wars and armed interventions they are carrying out in Vietnam, Indonesia, Burma, and Malaya! We must organize to ban the atomic bomb and all destructive weapons against the masses of the people, and demand that all major powers conclude peace agreements.

　　We are now separating, but this separation is to fulfill the tasks given to us by the conference. In many countries, the struggle is still arduous. Difficult battles are waiting for us to carry out, but we are not afraid. The power we use will surely achieve victory.

　　Full Text of the Soviet Representative's Speech

　　[Beijing News] The following is the full text of the speech delivered by Soviet representative Bafanova at the Beijing Municipal Conference celebrating the successful conclusion of the Asian Women's Representative Conference: Dear comrades, friends:

　　Let me extend warm greetings to you on behalf of the free and equal Soviet women. I am particularly pleased to be able to do this because Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, is now in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, as a guest of the Soviet people and Stalin.

　　As early as 1925, Comrade Stalin said: "The revolutionary power of the Chinese people is infinitely great. This power has not yet been manifested, but this power must be manifested in the future." Facts have proved that what Stalin said at that time was very correct. The People's Republic of China has now been established.

　　The victory of the Chinese revolution is a blow to the warmongers and an increase in the strength of the democratic camp. There are now 800 million people in the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia and the Soviet Union. This is an unbreakable and great power, a power that leads ordinary people in every corner of the world.

　　The word "peace" represents the greatest aspiration of mankind in our era. For us Soviet women, and for all our Soviet people, the struggle for peace is the struggle to quickly complete Stalin's plan. The greater the strength of our country, the greater the force for world peace. I assure you: we will do everything in our power to accomplish this task. We have restored cities and villages, built new factories, new schools, new houses, and built canals and railways. To ensure a good harvest, we are planting trees in arid areas. Our entire life serves peaceful construction.

　　Dear friends, you will also do all this. We sincerely hope that you will achieve greater success in the construction of New China.

　　Long live the victory of the People's Republic of China!
　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!
　　Let the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people grow and be consolidated!
　　Long live world peace!
　　Long live Stalin, the best friend of the Chinese people and all working people!

　　庆祝亚洲妇代会胜利成功
  　张晓梅开会辞
    【北京讯】北京市民主妇联主席张晓梅昨（十八）日在京市各界庆祝亚洲妇代会胜利成功大会上的开会辞，原文如下：亲爱的各国代表们，亲爱的来宾们：
    全北京二百万男人、女人和孩子们以无比欢欣鼓舞的心情来庆祝亚洲妇女代表会议的胜利成功。你们开了六天大会很辛苦，我们在此向你们致以热烈的敬礼和亲切的慰问。代表们，你们的大会胜利地完成了伟大的历史任务——团结了亚洲和世界各国的妇女，并向全世界宣布了我们共同的意志和希望。你们的工作将被写在历史上，我们世世代代的子孙将永远记得你们！
    亚洲妇女代表会议是世界各国为民主和平而斗争的战士们的胜利会师；这个会议更有力地告诉全世界：全亚洲的妇女团结起来了！这个会议加强和巩固了世界和平民主阵营的力量，也大大打击了帝国主义的势力；更由于中国人民的胜利，美帝国主义企图利用中国作为主要基地，以奴役全亚洲人民，并向苏联进攻的阴谋计划已经完全失败了。因此，全世界千千万万的人民因为这个会议而振奋，而欢呼；相反地，帝国主义者及其走狗们则为这个会议而恐惧，而发抖，因为他们知道：人民的胜利就是帝国主义的失败，他们更知道，他们离开坟墓已经不远了。
    我们衷心感谢国际民主妇联决定在中国召开这个会议，会议在中国召开，使我们的中国妇女，尤其是北京妇女有很好的机会参加大会。在大会过程中，我们学习了很多，我们更深刻地体会到国际主义精神的伟大。同时，我们更深刻地体会到：争取持久和平与人民民主的斗争，争取妇女解放的斗争，和争取孩子们幸福的未来的斗争，是没有国界的，我们的斗争是彼此支援，彼此鼓舞着的，苏联姊妹们的光辉成就，更给全世界妇女指出了幸福的光明道路！
    今天，中国人民革命是胜利了。胜利的经验告诉我们：如果没有伟大苏联的存在与帮助，没有各新民主主义国家的胜利，没有殖民地半殖民地国家解放运动的高涨，没有帝国主义国家内部人民民主斗争的发展，中国人民的胜利是不可能的，你们认为中国的胜利也是你们的胜利，我们也认为，一切民族的解放事业和争取人民民主与持久和平的事业也是我们的事业。只有当这些事业在全世界范围内赢得胜利的时候，我们的任务才算最后完成。
    亲爱的姊妹们！划时代的亚洲妇女代表会议胜利闭幕了，这个大会在中国召开是我们中华人民共和国的光荣，也是中国妇女尤其是北京妇女的无上光荣，这是中国革命的伟大胜利的结果，我再一次的说明，这个胜利是与各国姊妹们反对帝国主义和国内反动派的斗争分不开的。
    现在，你们要回去了，我们热烈的欢送你们，并且希望你们各国姊妹。常常来访问中国。当你们回到你们的祖国，请将我们中国人民崇高的敬意和亲切的问候带给你们的人民，带给你们的人民领袖，让我们在彻底消灭帝国主义争取和平的斗争中和胜利中团结得更紧密！
    庆祝亚洲妇女代表会议胜利成功！
    全亚洲妇女团结起来！
    全世界妇女团结起来！
    打倒帝国主义！
    保卫世界和平！
    保卫人民民主！
    被压迫民族解放万岁！
    国际民主妇联万岁！
    伟大的人类导师斯大林同志万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
  　聂市长讲话全文
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府聂荣臻市长在北京市各界庆祝亚洲妇代会胜利成功大会上的讲话，原文如下：各位代表，各位来宾，北京各界同胞：
    亚洲妇女代表会议，在中国的首都北京召开，我们深以为荣。现在代表会议已经胜利的闭幕，我们热烈地庆贺亚洲妇女代表会议的成功！
    亚洲妇女代表会议的代表，是来自亚洲各个国家，亚洲妇女代表会议的来宾，是来自亚洲以外的欧洲、美洲、非洲的各个国家，这正表示着伟大的国际的妇女大团结，也就是表示着我们伟大的力量，为着反对我们共同的敌人帝国主义而斗争，中国已经从反对封建主义和帝国主义的斗争中获得解放，亚洲的各个民族正在为着自己解放而英勇斗争着，我们相信，他们会和中国人民一样从帝国主义的奴役之下解放出来。我要向正在为民族解放而英勇斗争着的亚洲人民致以敬意！
    我们认为妇女的解放与整个民族的解放是分不开的，同时革命的力量更不能将妇女的力量计算在外，我们曾记得也不能够忘记在全世界反法西斯的战争中，涌现了无数杰出的妇女英雄，她们在各个战线上，同男子肩并肩的作战，她们贡献了她们的一切，为了赢得这一伟大斗争的胜利，象苏联的丹娘那样的卓绝榜样，已是尽人皆知的了，我们所赢得的反法西斯的伟大胜利，是与全世界先进妇女的奋斗努力分不开的。在中国，也是同样的，在二十多年的人民革命斗争中，也涌现了不少子弟兵的母亲，与各个战线上的妇女模范工作者，并从革命的胜利中获得的解放。
    同时我们亦清楚：中国革命的胜利，没有国际的援助，是不可能的。正是由于全世界人民包括妇女在内首先是苏联人民的奋斗努力，取得了反法西斯战争的胜利，才使中国的胜利成为可能。帝国主义这匹凶恶的野兽的头，正被强大的苏联和新民主国家在西方牵住了，这就使得中国能够在东方斩断它的一只脚。而中国的胜利，又将大大鼓励一切国家的被压迫人民，和被压迫民族奋斗的勇气，这就是中国革命的胜利的国际意义，对亚洲来说，这就更为重要，更为明显的。这就说明，今天我们的斗争必须要有国际统一战线，妇女运动也是一样。
    帝国主义是不甘心自己死亡的，它们无时不在想挑动新的战争，我们必须动员全亚洲妇女和全世界的妇女来制止这个战争，假如帝国主义一定要战争，妇女就决不允许帝国主义把自己的丈夫儿子送到战场上杀害自己的兄弟，同时妇女将组织自己的丈夫儿子，同帝国主义及其在各国的走狗作殊死的斗争。妇女是保卫世界持久和平的英勇战士，胜利一定属于全世界进步人类的。
    亚洲妇女代表会议成功万岁！
  　古久里夫人演讲全文
    【北京讯】古久里夫人在北京市各界庆祝亚洲妇女代表会议胜利成功大会上的演讲，全文如下：
    亲爱的朋友们：我现在代表国际民主妇联五十九个会员国八千万妇女向你们致敬。全世界的妇女都在追随着你们前进；对于中国人民所获得的伟大的胜利，寄与无限的热望。
    亚洲妇女代表会现在已经结束，它业已加强了我们的联系。它不仅加强了这会议中代表了二十三个国家的妇女的团结，同时也团结了国际妇联各会员国内关心我们工作的若干妇女。
    为民族独立的斗争是各大陆被压迫妇女的共同任务，因为她们所受帝国主义的压迫是相同的。
    我们的会议指出，和平的阵营是没有地理上的界限的。这阵营中包括了一切爱好和平而为和平斗争的妇女。有同她们政府在一道的妇女，如苏联，如各人民民主国家，如目前的中国；有反对战争贩子——帝国主义的妇女。
    因此，我们的会议可以说是集合了苏联，新中国，朝鲜，蒙古，捷克，越南以及帝国主义国家内进步的妇女，我们共同作了决定，就是还要加强我们的斗争，来实现世界保卫和平大会所决定的和最近莫斯科民主妇联执委会所通过的一切行动纲领。
    我们要用一切力量，反对他们在越南、印度尼西亚、缅甸、马来亚所进行的殖民战争和武装干涉战争！我们要组织起来，禁用原子弹和一切对人民大众的破坏性的武器，要求各大国都订立和平协定。
    我们现在要分手了，但这分手是为了完成大会所给与我们的任务。在很多国家，斗争还是艰苦的。一切困难的战斗在等着我们去进行，但我们不怕。我们所用的力量，是一定可以取得胜利的。
  　苏联代表讲话全文
    【北京讯】苏联代表巴菲诺娃在北京市各界庆祝亚洲妇女代表会议胜利成功大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    让我代表自由与平等的苏联妇女向你们致热烈的敬礼。我特别高兴能够这样作，因为中国人民的领袖毛主席现在正在苏联首都莫斯科作苏联人民和斯大林的客人。
    远在一九二五年，斯大林同志就说过：“中国人民革命的力量是无限大的，这个力量还没有表现出来，但是，这个力量将来一定要表现出来的。”事实证明了斯大林那个时候的话说的很对，中华人民共和国现在已经成立了。
    中国革命的胜利是对战争贩子们的一个打击，并且也是民主阵营力量的增长。现在欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家和苏联共有八万万人。这是一个牢不可破的巨大力量，这是领导全世界各个角落里的普通人们的一个力量。
    “和平”这两个字，在我们这一时代是表示着人类的最大的愿望。对于我们苏联妇女，和对于我们苏联全体人民，争取和平的斗争就是很快完成斯大林计划的斗争。我们国家的力量越大，世界和平的力量也越大。我向你们保证：我们要尽一切的力量，来完成这个任务。我们恢复了城市和乡村，建设了新的工厂，新的学校，新的住宅，修建了运河和铁路。为了保障丰收，我们在干旱的地方造林。我们的整个生活是了和平建设服务。
    亲爱的朋友们，所有这些你们也要作的，我们诚心诚意的希望你们，在新中国的建设上，获得更大的成功。
    中华人民共和国胜利万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    让伟大的中苏人民友好增长和巩固起来吧！
    世界和平万岁！
    中国人民和一切劳动人民最好的朋友斯大林万岁！
