Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th: Warsaw dispatch: Polish security organs dismantled a French diplomatic personnel-organized spy network in Wrocław in March of this year. The Wrocław District Military Court began trying the case on December 16th. During the trial, all defendants pleaded guilty. The verdict was announced on the 24th.

　　The investigation by the Polish State Security organs and the trial by the Wrocław District Military Court confirmed that French diplomatic personnel stationed in Poland abused their diplomatic rights and privileges, violating principles of international law. Since 1947, they organized a widespread spy network in Poland, conducting large-scale espionage and subversive activities under the guise of diplomatic affairs. Those who led or participated in espionage activities included Major Yom, Assistant Military Attaché of France; M. Meret, Archives Secretary of the French Embassy in Warsaw; Jarotsinski, Secretary of the French Consulate in Wrocław; Basseux, Secretary of the French Consulate in Wrocław; and Monge, Consul of France in Wrocław, among others. They used French diplomatic personnel, former Nazi Party members, and Polish reactionaries to collect military, economic, and political intelligence, and prepared to systematically sabotage machinery, industrial buildings, and mines to reduce Poland's industrial level. They also accepted tasks assigned by British intelligence agencies.

　　During the trial, the French government observer – Raymond Laporte, First Secretary of the French Embassy in Warsaw – was permitted to attend. He even gestured to the defendant Basseux, which was stopped by the court.

　　After six days of trial, the defendants all pleaded guilty. Judge Roman Boiko announced the following verdict: French citizen Basseux (former Secretary of the French Consulate in Wrocław) was sentenced to nine years in prison for espionage and illegal possession of military equipment. French citizen Bouquiaux (a messenger employed by the French Consulate in Wrocław) was sentenced to nine years in prison for espionage, preparing for sabotage, and spreading false information that caused material damage to Poland's national interests. French citizen Kubisiak was sentenced to nine years in prison, deprivation of civil rights for four years, and confiscation of all property for espionage, illegal possession of military equipment, engaging in activities harmful to the Polish state, thereby obtaining material rewards from someone serving the interests of a foreign government, and assisting organizations aimed at overthrowing the democratic government of Poland. French citizens Feltaisen and Hoffmann were sentenced to eight and seven years in prison, respectively, for espionage and preparing for sabotage, and their property was confiscated. German citizen Gilde was sentenced to six years in prison for espionage, but not for preparing sabotage.

　　The French government instructed its ambassador to Poland, Barrant, to lodge a "protest" with the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 28th, demanding the release and repatriation of the French spies who had been sentenced. This was resolutely rejected. The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs also pointed out that this action by France was an attempt to interfere in Poland's internal affairs.

    在审讯进行时，被准许列席的法政府观察员—法驻华沙大使馆一等秘书雷蒙·拉波尔特，竟向被告巴塞莱尔做手势，当经法庭予以阻止。

    法国政府训令驻波大使巴朗，于二十八日向波外交部提出“抗议”，要求将被叛徒刑的法国间谍释放回国，当经断然拒绝。波外交部并指出法国这种行动是企图干涉波兰的内政。
