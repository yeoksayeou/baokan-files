　　Gong Yu Zheng Paint Shop Fined for Making False Accounts and Concealing Taxes
    The illegal act of Wang Qinghe, manager of the Beijing Gong Yu Zheng Paint Shop, in forging accounts and intentionally concealing taxes, has been uncovered by the Tax Bureau. After the initial assessment of income tax and business tax for profit-making enterprises, the shop deliberately claimed that its score was too high, despite not being based on the actual business situation. They wrote to the Third Tax Bureau with a tone of questioning, saying: "If the paint industry collapses due to excessive tax payments, would it contradict the government's policy of protecting industry and commerce? Who will bear this responsibility?" The letter also slandered the government's tax policies. To understand the actual business situation of the shop and whether there were any actual difficulties, the Tax Bureau decided to audit Gong Yu Zheng Paint Shop's accounts. After careful investigation by the Tax Bureau, it was found that the old inventory of untaxed goods registered with the Tax Bureau was false, and 136 large barrels (100 catties per barrel) of paint, worth more than 400 million yuan, were concealed. It was also found that there were two sets of accounts for January to March, with a difference of 32 times; and that 24 barrels of paint in stock were not recorded at all. With this conclusive evidence, the shop manager Wang Qinghe had to abandon his cunning and arrogant attitude and admitted that it was true that he had recorded false accounts with the intention of evading taxes. The government's tax policy is to protect the development of industry and commerce. Those who have actual difficulties and can provide specific and accurate materials should and will be given appropriate consideration. However, such illegal acts of forging accounts, intentionally concealing taxes and threatening the government cannot be tolerated. Therefore, the Municipal Tax Bureau has decided: (1) to order Wang Qinghe, the manager of the shop, to publish an apology in the newspaper; (2) for the goods tax part, in addition to paying the tax arrears, a fine of twice the amount will be imposed; (3) for the profit-making enterprise income tax and business tax part, they will be ordered to pay according to the assessed score for the time being; at the same time, the Tax Bureau will continue to investigate the suspicious points in its accounts.

　　公裕正颜料庄造假账瞒税被罚
    ★京市公裕正颜料庄经理王清河伪造账目有意瞒税的违法行为，已为税局查出。当此次营利事业所得税与营业税分数评定后，该商号不根据本身营业实际情况，却故意说他的分数多，并写信给税务第三分局，以责问的口吻说：“倘因颜料业纳税过多而倒闭，是否与政府保护工商业之政策相违背，此责任由谁负担？”信中还污蔑政府的税收政策。税局为了解该号营业实际情况，看是否存有实际困难，乃决定对公裕正颜料庄进行查账。经税局慎重调查结果，查出该号前向税局登记的旧存未税货物是假的，匿存颜料达一百三十六大桶（每桶一百斤），价值在四亿元以上。并查出该号一至三月份有前后柜两套账目，相差三十二倍之钜；且有现存货二十四桶颜料根本没有登账。在此证据确凿的情况下，该商号经理王清河只有收起狡猾傲慢的态度，承认记载假账，意图偷税是实。政府税收政策是保护工商业发展的，对有实际困难而能提出具体确实材料者，是应该且一定会予以适当照顾的，但对该号这种伪造账目，有意瞒税且威胁政府的不法行为，自不能加以纵容。市税务局为此，已决定：（一）令该商号经理王清河登报公开道歉；（二）其货物税部分，除补税外，并处以二倍之罚金；（三）其营利事业所得税与营业税部分，暂依评议分数令其缴纳；同时，税局将继续调查其账目中可疑之处。
