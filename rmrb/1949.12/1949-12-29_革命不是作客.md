　　Revolution is Not Just Being a Guest
　　Liao Muxian

　　Half a year ago, I came to the Liberated Area with revolutionary enthusiasm. But when I encountered practical life problems and things were not as I wished, I felt discontented. So, during the learning process, I always looked for loopholes, complained, and even became silent and passive. A comrade who came with me asked me kindly, "Hey! Why have you changed now?" I didn't answer, but pondered in distress, "Why?"

　　After more than two months of ideological remolding, I started working. I was assigned to a work team to do mass movements. At that time, the central task was to create a wave of support for the front while not delaying farming. At the discussion meetings about sending firewood, grain, and stretchers to the army, I saw young men enthusiastically signing up, old men vying to carry heavy loads, and women organizing mutual aid teams to replace the men who were delayed in the fields due to supporting the front. Seeing their spirit of saving money to buy oil, salt, and soybeans, waiting for the army to pass by on its way south, and happily sewing comfort bags stitch by stitch, I asked myself: "Have you ever seen such enthusiastic masses in the Kuomintang-controlled areas? Have you ever heard of scattered farmers being able to organize themselves?" No, all of this was something that the old society didn't have!

　　Following the liberation of a series of large cities, we also began marching. The march coincided with the time for harvesting wheat and transplanting rice. As soon as the comrades arrived, they helped the people with their work, competing to see who could do it better and who could do more. The people in the new district were all surprised and happy, saying, "We were so scared before you came, but now that you're here, we really don't want you to leave! Look! This year, you helped with the harvest, and the rice transplanting was done quickly, saving us money and catching up with the timing..." Each departure, they sent us off happily, leaving a very deep impression on my mind.

　　Whenever I rested, I would recall the enthusiasm of the masses and their hopes for us. I looked at their busy lives from morning till night, the broken furniture in their dark houses, and the oxen panting from exhaustion. I recalled the scene of the Kuomintang reactionaries oppressing the working people. Now, to restore their health and develop production, this work is very arduous.

　　The current difficulties are all difficulties in progress, and they can be overcome. Thinking that I am only in my twenties, my old views and habits cannot be changed all at once. How can the entire weak old society be transformed into a prosperous new society without going through a stage of arduous struggle! After these practical experiences, I began to blame myself: "Revolution is not a personal fantasy, revolution is a practical struggle, it is to destroy the corrupt and create the new." From this reflection, I realized that I was initially living in the Liberated Area with the mentality of being a guest, criticizing the Liberated Area from the sidelines. However, "revolution" is not "being a guest." It is about earnestly taking on the responsibilities one should bear. So, I began to live bravely and firmly.

　　革命不是作客
    廖慕先
    半年前我怀着革命的热情来到解放区，当一遇到实际生活问题，有不如意地方时，我有不满情绪。于是在学习过程中，我总钻些小空子，发牢骚甚至沉默、消极。一个同来的同志亲切的问我：“喂！为什么你现在变了呢？”我没有回答，我苦闷的考虑着“为什么？”
    经过两个多月的思想改造，便开始了工作，我被分到工作团作群众运动。当时的中心任务是一面掀起支前热潮，一面还不耽误耕作。在送军柴，军粮，担架的讨论会上，我看到年青小伙子踊跃报名，老头子争着挑重的、妇女们组织变工小组，代替男人们因支前而耽搁的田间重活等等情形。在他们节省开支买油盐、黄豆，等待大军南下路过时吃，一针针欢欣地缝着慰劳袋的精神下，我问着自己：“你在国统区曾经看见过这栗兴高采烈的群众吗？曾经听说过散漫的农民能组织起来吗？”没有，所有这一切都是旧社会所没有的啊！
    随着一连串大城市的解放，我们也开始了行军，行军期间正是割麦插秧的时候，同志们一往下来就帮助老百姓做活。还比赛谁做得好，谁做得多。新区的老百姓都惊奇高兴的说：“你们没来的时候怕死了，来了真舒不得你们走！瞧！今年收割，你们帮忙，插秧一会就弄好了，又少化钱，又赶上了时间，”……每次的离别，他们都欢欣的送着，也都在我脑子里留下很深刻的印象。
    每当休息时，我便回忆着群众的热情以及对我们的希望。我看着他们从早到晚忙碌的情形，黑屋子里面的破烂家具，累得气喘的耕牛，回忆着国民党反动派压榨劳苦大众的情景，现在要他们恢复健康发展生产，这一工作是非常艰苦的。
    现在的困难，都是前进中的困难，是可以克服的。想想我自己还只二十来岁的人，旧的观点和习气，都不能一下子改变过来，何况整个贫弱的旧社会不经过一个艰苦奋斗阶段，又怎能变成一个富强的新社会呢！经过这些实际的体验后，我开始责备自己：“革命不是个人凭空的幻想，革命是实际的斗争，是破坏腐旧的，还得创造出新的。”从这一次的反省中，我认识到自己当初是以作客的心里生活在解放区，袖手旁观的批判解放区，然而“革命”并不是“作客”。是应该踏实的担当起自己应负的责任，于是我开始转向勇敢坚定的生活起来了。
