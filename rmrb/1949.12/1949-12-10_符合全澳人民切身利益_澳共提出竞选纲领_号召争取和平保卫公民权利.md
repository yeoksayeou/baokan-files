　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 9th (via TASS, Sydney, December 7th): As Australia prepares for federal parliamentary elections on December 10th, the Labor Party, defending the interests of the ruling groups, and the Liberal and Country Party coalition are competing with the most cunning methods of deceiving voters and vote-catching election slogans. The Australian Communist Party has put forward an election platform that meets the vital interests of the Australian people, a platform for striving for peace and opposing warmongers. Australian Communist Party Chairman Dixon, in discussing the party's election policies, stated: The Communist Party is the only party in the election with policies based on the needs of the working people. In contrast to the bourgeois parties, the Communist Party calls for a policy of controlling and lowering prices and increasing wages. Communist candidates emphasize the need to unite all people, especially the working class, and to defend peace, civil liberties, and political rights. Dixon pointed out that the demand for the release of Australian Communist Party General Secretary Sharkey has received widespread response among workers. However, the Communist Party's election campaign is being conducted in an anti-democratic atmosphere. Communist candidates are deprived of most of the conveniences used by the Labor Party and the so-called "opposition party." Communist leaders are prohibited from broadcasting political speeches, while others can do so at any time. Capitalist newspapers refuse to publish Communist Party election advertisements, and some even attempt to disrupt Communist Party candidates' election rallies.

　　符合全澳人民切身利益
  　澳共提出竞选纲领
    号召争取和平保卫公民权利
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社悉尼七日讯：澳大利亚将于十二月十日举行联邦议会的选举。当维护统治集团利益的工党与自由党和乡村党两党的联盟，正在以最巧妙的欺骗选民的方法和笼络人心的选举口号竞选时，澳大利亚共产党提出了符合澳大利人民切身利益的竞选纲领，为争取和平及反对战争贩子而斗争的纲领。澳大利亚共产党主席狄克逊在谈及该党的竞选政策时称：共产党在选举中是有着以劳动人民的需要为基础的政策的唯一政党。共产党与资产阶级的政党相反，它要求实行管制和降低物价和增加工资的政策。共产党候选人强调必须团结全体人民，特别是工人阶级，必须保卫和平、公民自由和政治权利。狄克逊指出：释放澳共总书记夏基的要求，已在工人中间得到广泛的响应。但共产党的竞选是在反民主的气氛中进行的。共产党候选人被剥夺了工党与所谓“反对党”所使用的大部分便利条件。共产党的领袖们被禁止广播政治演说，而其他的人，则可以随时这样作。资本家的报纸则拒绝刊载共产党的竞选广告，还有人企图破坏共产党候选人的竞选大会。
