Talking About Our Exams
    Student of Beijing Normal School, Wang Shuzhi
    Speaking of exams, in the past, they were always seen as passing a barrier. Because we are a normal school, after graduation, we will become teachers. In the old society, becoming a teacher was not so easy. Taking our school as an example, students were purely measured by grades. If you were first in the exams every year, you would be assigned a job first after graduation, and assigned to a better place. As a result, students were jealous of each other, competed for grades, and only cared about getting 100 for themselves, regardless of others.
    This time, under the ideological leadership of the school, and with the continuous improvement of students' awareness, everyone understands that in today's society, there is no need to worry about not having a job after graduation, because there are many jobs waiting for us! What we fear is our own lack of ability to work. Therefore, we don't care much about grades anymore. We feel that simply getting 100 points is useless. We must have a real set of skills to serve the people.
    Therefore, the exam methods this time, after research by the teachers and suggestions from the students, regarding liberal arts courses such as Chinese, history, and education, many question outlines were prepared in advance. After heated discussions in groups, the exams were conducted. One student happily said: "In the past, I only knew how to rote memorize notes, and I forgot everything immediately after the exam. This time, after the discussion, I really gained a lot." In terms of scoring, there are three types: class scores, group scores, and individual scores. It was also decided to select two exemplary groups and one model class from the whole school to give prizes. This call to action boosted the students' morale even higher. They felt that it was not enough for themselves to be good, they had to make the group good, and it was not enough for one group to be good, they had to make the whole class good. Therefore, students with good grades patiently helped students with poorer grades. In addition to group discussions, mutual aid groups were also freely organized, with two to three people. A wave of enthusiasm for learning filled the whole school. The study groups that could not be activated in the past have also become active, striving to become model groups. Our exams were completed in such an enthusiastic atmosphere, and we are prepared to continue to implement this spirit.

　　谈我们的考试
    北师学生  王淑志
    提起考试来，过去总看成是过关，因为我们是师范学校，毕业后就要当教员了，在旧社会里当教员也不是那么容易的，就拿我们学校来说，单纯的以分数来衡量一个学生，只要你每年考第一，毕业后就先分配工作，而且分配到比较好的地方去，结果造成了同学彼此嫉妒、争分数、只顾个人考一百，不管别人。
    这次由学校的思想领导，与同学们不断的提高觉悟，都了解到在今天的社会里是不用愁毕业后没有工作做了，因为目前就有许多工作在等着我们呢！所怕的就是自己没有工作的能力，所以对于分数都不太计较了，觉得单纯的考一百分是没用的，必要有一套真正的本领才能给人民服务。
    所以这次的考试方式，经过先生们的研究与同学们的提意见，关于文科的课程，如国文、历史和教育等课程，都预先出了很多的题纲，经过小组的热烈讨论以后，再进行考试，一个同学很高兴的说：“过去我只知道死背笔记，考试完立刻就忘了，这次经过讨论，我真得到了不少的收获”。在记分数方面有三种：即班分数、小组分数和个人分数。并决定在全校选出两个典型的小组，与一个模范班来予以奖品。这一号召，同学们的情绪更高了，觉得自己好了是不够的，必须使小组好起来，一个小组好起来还是不够，必须再使全班好起来，于是功课好的同学耐心的帮助功课较差的同学，除小组讨论外，又自由组织了互助小组，两人至三人，学习的热潮布满了全校，以往动不起来的学习小组也都活跃起来了，争取模范小组。我们的考试就在这样热烈的情绪下完成了，并准备将这种精神继续贯彻下去。
