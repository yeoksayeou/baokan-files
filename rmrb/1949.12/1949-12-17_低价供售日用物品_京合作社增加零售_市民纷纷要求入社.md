　　Low-Priced Daily Necessities Offered
　　Beijing Cooperatives Increase Retail Sales
　　Citizens Eager to Join
　　[Our Newspaper] From the price fluctuations of last month, people have gradually further recognized the benefits of cooperatives. In places without cooperatives, citizens are clamoring for their establishment. Existing cooperatives have also gained many new members. During this period, Beijing added twenty cooperatives, including one consumer cooperative in a public factory, four consumer cooperatives in private factories, six consumer cooperatives in government agencies, four consumer cooperatives in schools, and five consumer cooperatives in neighborhoods. Membership increased by 41,083, of which neighborhood members increased by 21,506. The business of the cooperatives is also unprecedentedly active. The Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation has added two oil and salt outlets and a calico consignment shop. The Farmer's Hostel outside Qianmen, due to a large number of patrons, has expanded the area of its retail department by one and a half times, and the daily sales volume has increased by two times compared to before the price fluctuations. The Xidan business department, since it began doing business with non-members on October 24th, has seen a steady increase in customers, especially on Sundays, because the prices are cheap and the goods are as many as 500 kinds. Every day, people are crowding outside the door before opening time. Selling cloth by the foot and cotton by the pound, the daily cash sales reach 12 to 13 million yuan, with a maximum of 18 million yuan. Now the business department and the hostel are trying to find larger buildings to expand their retail departments.

　　低价供售日用物品
  　京合作社增加零售
  　市民纷纷要求入社
    【本报讯】从上月物价波动中，人们逐渐进一步认识了合作社的好处。在没有合作社的地方，市民纷纷要求建社。已有的合作社也增加了好多社员。在这一时期，北京市增加了合作社二十个，计公营工厂消费社一个，私营工厂消费社四个，机关消费社六个，学校消费社四个，街道消费社五个。社员增加四一、○八三人，其中街道社员增加二一、五○六人。合作社业务亦空前活跃。市供销合作总社增辟了两个油盐门市部和花纱布代销处。前门外农民招待所，由于顾主很多，特把门市部的面积扩大了一倍半，每日售货量是较物价波动前增加了两倍。西单营业部，自十月二十四日开始做非社员买卖以来，顾客日渐增多，特别是星期日顾客更是拥挤，因为价钱便宜，且货品多达五百余种。每天不等到开业时间门外就挤满了人，零尺卖布，零斤卖棉花，每天都要卖现款一千二、三百万元，最高时达到一千八百万元。现在营业部和招待所正想法找大房子扩大门市部。
