Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 10th:

　　The first National Postal Conference convened by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government opened in Beijing today. The conference is expected to last for two weeks. Attendees include representatives from the postal management bureaus and major postal administrations of major administrative regions such as North China, Northeast China, East China, Northwest China, Central South China, and Southwest China, as well as representatives from postal labor unions in various regions, totaling more than sixty people. The main agenda of the conference is to discuss and resolve the unified issues of national post office organizational structure, post office supply, finance, accounting, and business systems. At 1:30 pm on the 10th, the conference solemnly opened in the auditorium of the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. In addition to the representatives, Minister Zhu Xuefan of the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and dozens of guests attended the meeting. The conference began with an opening speech by Zhao Zhigang, Deputy Director of the National Postal Administration, who said: The people's postal services in various regions have developed during the war, with different personnel systems and rules of procedure. Now that the revolutionary war has achieved a basic victory across the country, in order to meet the needs of the people and the development of the people's postal service, the national postal service must be unified in order to carry out the work of consolidation and restoration under the overall leadership. Minister Zhu Xuefan then delivered a speech. In his speech, he asked the conference to discuss and resolve the following issues: First, how to establish the National Postal Administration; second, to unify the postal supply, finance, and business systems, and to conduct preliminary research on gradually unifying the national postal workers' salary standards, signing collective contracts, and labor insurance; third, to plan the restoration of national postal routes; fourth, to closely cooperate with transportation departments such as railways, aviation, highways, and shipping to accelerate postal transportation; fifth, to determine that the business policy of the postal enterprise is to develop from the city center to the vast rural areas, facilitating communication for the broad masses of the people; sixth, the enterprise handling policy should be changed from the postal organ of the Kuomintang era to the postal enterprise, promoting the spirit of democracy, implementing scientific management, and improving work efficiency. Minister Zhu said: Since the People's Liberation Army marched south and the vast areas of Jiangnan were liberated, the national postal service has rapidly restored 80 percent of its offices and business. In the restoration of the national postal service, responsible postal cadres in various regions are required to formulate the budget of the postal department based on the Central People's Government's 1950 budget and ensure its effective implementation, so that the people's postal service can gradually move towards self-sufficiency. Because major administrative regions had previously held postal conferences before this conference, the representatives brought 190 proposals. After the postal administrations of the major administrative regions report on their work, the conference will be divided into administrative, business, and financial groups for discussion.

  　全国邮政会议昨揭幕
    朱学范部长号召人民邮政事业自给自足
    【新华社北京十日电】中央人民政府邮电部召开的首次全国邮政会议今日在京开幕。会期预计为两周。出席会议的有华北、东北、华东、西北、中南、西南等各大行政区的邮政管理总局和主要邮政管理局的代表，和各区邮政工会代表共六十余人。会议主要议程为讨论并解决全国邮局组织机构，邮局的供应、财务、会计、业务等制度的统一问题。十日下午一时半，会议在中央邮电部大礼堂隆重开幕。到会的除代表外有中央邮电部朱学范部长和来宾数十人。会议首由全国邮政总局赵志刚副局长致开幕词，他说：各地区的人民邮政事业是在战争中发展起来的，有不同的人事制度和办事规章。现在革命战争已在全国取得基本胜利，为适应人民的要求和人民邮政事业的发展，全国邮政必须统一，以便在总的领导下进行整理和恢复的工作。接着朱学范部长讲话。他在讲话中要求会议讨论并解决以下几个问题：第一，如何建立邮政总局；第二，统一邮政供应、财务、业务的制度，并对逐步统一全国邮政工人工薪标准，订立集体合同和劳动保险作初步的研究；第三，计划恢复全国邮路；第四，与铁路、航空、公路、航业等交通部门密切合作，加速邮运；第五，确定邮政企业经营方针是以城市为中心向广大农村发展，便利广大人民通讯；第六，企业处理方针应该从国民党时代的邮政机关化改变为邮政企业化，发扬民主精神，实行科学管理，提高工作效率。朱部长说：自从人民解放军大军南下，江南广大地区解放，全国邮政已迅速恢复了局所和业务的百分之八十。在全国邮政的恢复中，要求各地邮政负责干部，根据中央人民政府一九五○年的概算，拟定邮政部门的预算，并保证切实执行，使人民邮政事业能够逐步走向自给自足的道路。由于此次会议前，各大行政区均曾召开邮政会议，所以此次与会代表带来的提案达一百九十件。会议将于各大行政区的邮管局分别报告工作后，分行政、业务、财务三组进行讨论。
