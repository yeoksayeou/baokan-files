　　Day and Night

    People in ancient times told us that the sky was round and the earth was square, and the sun, moon, and stars revolved around the earth. Later, scientists said that these ideas were incorrect. It's not that the celestial bodies are moving, but that the earth is moving. But why do we all clearly see the sun rising in the east every morning and setting in the west every evening? Why do we see the moon and stars slowly moving from east to west at night? To solve this problem, let's first take an example. We have all been on trains, buses, or streetcars. When we sit in a fast-moving vehicle and look out the window, we see telephone poles, trees, houses, and pedestrians along the road quickly rushing backward; it seems as if we are not moving. But in reality, the telephone poles and houses cannot move; it is we ourselves who are moving, it is our own eyes that are moving forward. Originally, there was a telephone pole in front of us, but after two seconds, our car passed it, and it moved to our back; it seems as if the telephone pole is moving.

    We stand on the ground and look at the sky, and it is the same. The sun and stars are stationary (except for the moon), and the earth itself is rotating. People on Earth forget that they are moving and mistakenly believe that the sun and stars are moving. The Earth rotates from west to east, so we see the sun, stars, and moon moving from east to west. Just as when we ride in a car moving from west to east, we see the telephone poles outside the car running from east to west. The Earth is a large oblate spheroid, and its rotation is like a spinning wheel. Its axis points north and south, so it rotates from west to east while remaining stationary in the north and south. It takes twenty-four hours, or one day, to complete one revolution.

    The rotation we are talking about here is different from the Earth's revolution around the sun, which forms spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The Earth revolves around the sun while also rotating on its axis. This rotation is a bit like a child's spinning top. It takes the Earth one year to revolve around the sun, creating the four seasons. It takes it one day to complete one rotation, dividing day and night.

    Now let's see how day and night are divided. Let's do an experiment first. Place a lamp in the room, and we stand next to it and spin around. When we face the lamp, our chest is bright, and our back is dark. Then we turn half a circle, turning our back to the lamp, and now our chest is dark, and our back is lit up. If we continue to turn half a circle, our chest will be lit up again, and our back will fall into darkness again. Day and night on Earth are also like this. The sun is like the lamp, and the Earth is like the person spinning around. The side illuminated by the sun is daytime, and the side not illuminated by the sun is nighttime. As the Earth rotates, day and night alternate. It takes the Earth twenty-four hours to complete one rotation, so one day and one night is twenty-four hours.

    You must have also noticed a problem: why does it get dark so early in winter and dawn so late? In summer, it doesn't get dark until after eight o'clock in the evening, and it dawns at five o'clock in the morning. In other words, why are days short and nights long in winter, and days long and nights short in summer? To answer this question, we must go back and think about the difference between winter and summer. This is because the Earth is tilted and revolves around the sun. The Earth tilts the Northern Hemisphere towards the sun in July and August each year, and it tilts the Southern Hemisphere towards the sun at the beginning and end of the year. At the beginning of the year, when we in the Northern Hemisphere are in winter, the sun shines directly on the Southern Hemisphere, and people in the Northern Hemisphere can only touch the edge to bask in the sun. Therefore, the time we spend under the sunlight is not long, that is to say, the days are short, and the nights are long. Conversely, in July and August each year, our Northern Hemisphere is facing the sun, so the area that can be illuminated by sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere is particularly large, and the time we spend under the sunlight is also long, that is to say, the days are long, and the nights are short. The reason for long days and short nights in summer and short days and long nights in winter is this.

    The winter solstice each year is when the sun is most oblique, so the day is shortest and the night is longest on the winter solstice. The summer solstice each year is when the sun shines directly overhead, so the day is longest and the night is shortest on the summer solstice.

    In the Northern Hemisphere's winter, the further north you go, the more oblique the sun becomes, the shorter the days become, and the longer the nights become. Finally, in the northernmost part of the Earth, the sun becomes completely invisible. This place is called the "North Pole," just like the small area at the crown of our heads. There, it is night day after day, and this dark world lasts for half a year, until the following spring when the sun begins to shine directly on the Northern Hemisphere before it can see the light again. But this sight will also last for half a year. Because it is now the Northern Hemisphere's turn to face the sun, no matter how the Earth rotates from west to east, the sunlight always grabs the northernmost part of the Earth. This is like when we stand next to a lamp that shines on our upper body from a slanting angle, no matter how we spin around, the crown of our heads is always brightly lit, only our chest and back are dark and light alternately. The North Pole of the Northern Hemisphere is like the crown of our heads, always illuminated by sunlight. It is not until the autumnal equinox that the sunlight goes to shine directly on the Southern Hemisphere, and the North Pole falls into darkness again. Therefore, in the North Pole, there is only one day and one night a year. The daytime lasts for half a year, and the nighttime also lasts for half a year. Of course, it is summer when it is daytime there, and it is winter when it is nighttime there. The southernmost part of the Earth is the same, that place is called "South Pole". Because the sun always shines obliquely on the South Pole and the North Pole, the weather is very cold, and it is icy and snowy all year round, never thawing, and there is also a half-year period of darkness each year. The people there fight against nature in this difficult and arduous environment, transforming the world and striving for survival.

　　昼夜
    杨光中
    古时候的人告诉我们说：天圆地方，太阳、月亮、星星就绕着地转圈。后来科学家说，这些活是不对的。不是天上的东西在动，而是地在动。可是为什么我们每个人都明明白白的看见太阳每天早晨从东边出来，跑到西边去落山呢？为什么我们晚上看到月亮、星星都慢慢的由东往西挪呢？要解决这个问题，我们先来举一个例子。我们都坐过火车或者汽车电车的。当我们坐一辆开得很快的车子里的时候，我们向窗外一望，就看见车子两旁的电线杆、树林、房屋、路上的行人都在飞快地往后跑；自己倒好象并没有动。可是实际上，电线杆，房屋都是不能动的；动的是我们自己，是我们自己的眼睛在往前跑。本来有一棵电线杆在我们前面的，过了两秒钟我们的车开了过去，它就变到我们后面去了；看来就象是电线杆在动一样。
    我们站在地上来看天，也是这样。太阳、星星都是不动的（月亮除外），地球自己在转。地球上的人就忘掉自己在动，反而以为是太阳、星星在动。地球是由西往东转的，所以我们看太阳、星星、月亮是由东往西去的。正象我们坐上一辆由西往东开的车，就看见车外的电线杆由东往西跑一样。地球是一个大的扁球，它的转法就象一个轮盘一样，它的轴是向着南北方向的，所以它是南北不动由西往东的转的，打一回身要化二十四个钟头，也就是一天。
    我们这里说的打转转，和形成春夏秋冬的地球绕着太阳转圈是两回事。地球一方面要绕着太阳转圈，同时自己又要打转转。它这种转法有点象小孩玩的陀螺。地球绕太阳转一圈要化一年功夫，造成一年四季。它自己回一个身要化一天的功夫，分出昼夜来。
    现在我们来看昼夜是怎么分出来的。我们先来做一个实验。在屋子里摆一盏灯，我们站在它的旁边打转转。当我们面对着灯的时候，胸前是亮的，背后是黑的。后来我们转过去半圈，把背对着灯了，这时胸前是黑的，背后就亮起来。要是再接着转半圈，胸前就又照亮了，背后又落入黑暗之中。地球上的昼夜也就是这么来的。太阳就象是那盏灯，地球就象是那个打转转的人。太阳照射的那一面是白天，太阳照不到的一那一面就是黑夜。地球一打转，白天黑夜就替换着来了。地球打一转要二十四个钟头，所以一天加一夜也就是二十四个钟头。
    各位一定还注意到一个问题，就是：为什么现在冬天天黑得那么早，天亮得又那么迟？在夏天是晚上八点多钟才天黑，早上五点钟就天亮了。换句话说：为什么冬季昼短夜长，夏季昼长夜短？要回答这个问题，我们一定要回过头去想一想冬天和夏天的不同。这是由于地球是一面倒而且绕着太阳转圈的缘故，地球在每年七八月把北半球冲着太阳，而在年头年尾把南半球冲着太阳。在年头上我们北半球过冬季的时候，太阳直照在南半球上，北半球的人只能摸一个边来晒晒太阳，因此我们呆在太阳光下面的时间也不会久，也就是说：白天短，夜晚长。反过来，到每年七八月间的时候，我们北半球是向着太阳的了，所以北半球上能照得到太阳光的范围特别大，我们呆在太阳光下的时间也久，也就是说：白天长，夜晚短。夏季昼长夜短，冬季昼短夜长就是这个道理。
    每年冬至是太阳偏得最斜的时候，所以冬至那天白天最短，黑夜最长。每年夏至是太阳笔直的当头照的时候，所以夏至那天白天最长，黑夜最短。
    在北半球的冬天，越往北去，太阳越偏，白天也就越短，黑夜越长，最后到了地球的最北的那一带地方就完全看不见太阳了。这个地方叫做“北极”，就象在我们头顶上脑门心的那一小块地方一样。那儿一天接一天都是黑夜，这样的黑暗世界要连过半年之久，一直要等到来年春季，太阳开始直射北半球的时候才能重见光明。但是这一见又要见半年的太阳。因为这时候是轮到北半球来向着太阳了，任凭地球怎样由西往东打圈圈，太阳光始终抓住地球最北的那一块地方。这就好象我们站在一盏从斜上方照准我们上半身的灯旁边的时候，无论我们怎样打转，我们的脑门心总是被灯光照得亮堂堂的，只有我们的胸前背后才一会儿黑一会儿亮的。北半球的北极也就象我们的脑门心那样一直被太阳光照亮。一直到秋分时节，太阳光又去直射南半球了，北极才又堕入黑暗。所以在北极地方一年只有一个白昼，一个黑夜。白昼要连过半年之久，黑夜也要连过半年之久。那儿过白天的时候当然是夏季，过黑夜的时候是冬季。地球最南边的那一带地方也是一样，那儿叫做“南极”地方。南极和北极因为太阳老是斜照的缘故，天气很冷，整年冰天雪地，从来也不会化冻，并且每年又有整半年的黑暗时期，那儿的人民就在这种艰难困苦的环境中和大自然作战，改造世界争取生存。
