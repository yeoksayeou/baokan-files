Hebei Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs General Study Committee

Summarizes One Year of Cadre Study

Cadres Have Completed the Study of Social Development History and Political Economics, and Have Developed a Habit of Long-Term Adherence to Study

[This newspaper's dispatch] All cadres of the directly subordinate organs of Hebei Province have systematically completed their study of social development history and political economics this year. Many cadres have also studied several theoretical books on their own in addition to the planned curriculum. The atmosphere of theoretical study has been greatly enhanced. Generally, they have developed the habit of adhering to study for the long term, and many comrades consider it a loss to delay their studies. In the summary of one year of cadre study, the General Study Committee pointed out that after theoretical study, most comrades have initially grasped the general laws of class struggle and social development, and have begun to understand how to link the study of social development with Chinese issues. Many cadres have strengthened their concept of labor production and have become interested in studying economic issues. They have realized that without studying economic work, it is impossible to understand society or solve social problems. At the same time, they have gained a deeper understanding of the essence of capitalism. Some comrades have reviewed that they were once more or less confused by some superficial prosperous appearances of capitalism in the past, and did not know its internal decay and contradictions. As a result, they made some overestimations of the politics, economy, and culture of capitalist countries. After study, they have a preliminary understanding of the inherent and insurmountable contradictions of capitalism, and have increased their contempt for imperialism. Some comrades have further cleared up some of their bourgeois erroneous viewpoints. In addition, they have enriched their general knowledge of political economy, preparing conditions for further theoretical study. In terms of leadership in learning, there is a more accurate understanding of the cultural, political, and theoretical level of general cadres, and certain experiences have been gained in leading on-the-job cadre learning, such as more appropriate solutions have been found for principles, plans, grading, and learning methods.

In terms of policy study, the materials of the Second Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee, Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Xinhua News Agency's commentaries on the White Paper, important documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and materials on the united front were systematically studied over the past year. These documents have greatly educated cadres, especially the materials of the Second Plenary Session and "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," which have enriched everyone's political and economic knowledge and resolved many confused concepts and doubts. After studying, everyone felt that they "understood," which has greatly contributed to the transformation and improvement of cadres' ideology and work style. In the study of CPPCC documents and united front issues, more confused concepts and doubtful ideas were exposed, and the narrow closed-doorism that existed among some cadres has been basically resolved. This has particularly directly helped to improve the relationship between new and old cadres. However, the study of the commentaries on the US imperialist White Paper was not very in-depth. The reason is mainly that the leadership failed to mobilize in depth, and the general cadres did not pay attention to it, thinking that they already had an understanding of US imperialism and failed to humbly and deeply study and review.

The summary provided several key experiences:

At the beginning of the study, emphasis should be placed on collective self-study to develop study habits; after the study system is initially established, ideological guidance must be strengthened to deepen the study.

(1) Strengthening organizational leadership and strictly controlling the system are powerful methods for establishing study. This year, Hebei Province was formed by the merger of the original three administrative regions of Jizhong, Jinan, and Jidong. The leading organs of the three regions had successively started theoretical study before or at the beginning of the year, and all had regular policy study, but the focus of study, grading standards, and study progress were different. After the merger of the province, the General Study Committee of the provincial directly subordinate organs was organized, and the highest leaders of the party, government, army, and people personally participated and set up a full-time secretary. The General Study Committee uniformly led the branch study committees at all levels, solving problems such as class organization, unified teaching materials, and unified progress; and formulated systems for meetings, reports, tests, summaries, answering questions, and study attendance, so that study could be smoothly adhered to. Experience has proven that at the beginning of study, emphasis should be placed on collective self-study, which has a great effect on overcoming everyone's lax habits and developing study habits. However, after the study system has been initially established, ideological guidance must be strengthened in a timely manner, and assistance should be provided level by level to remove learning obstacles, so as to consolidate and deepen learning, improve learning enthusiasm, and in turn, promote the advancement of organizational leadership. The General Study Committee has not done enough in this regard, and the branch committees at all levels have also failed to be responsible for concentrating on and studying the difficult problems in learning. As a result, some cadres were hindered from deepening their studies and affected their learning enthusiasm because individual simple problems were not resolved in a timely manner. For some problems that were not easy to solve for a while, there was also a lack of necessary explanations, which increased everyone's ideological burden. The General Study Committee therefore suggested that the branch committees should preferably set up advisory groups to specifically study and answer difficult questions.

(2) The responsible comrades themselves actively study and regularly study everyone's learning situation, which has a great effect on promoting the learning movement. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels should consciously strive to learn; study committees at all levels should also seize the opportunity to urge the leading cadres of the organs to study, so that they do not have special or exceptional emotions.

(3) Strengthening the collective leadership of the study committee and combining it with in-depth and universal ideological mobilization is a powerful guarantee for implementing the study plan and deepening learning. In September, the adjustment of the study grading was carried out. Because there was a lack of extensive discussion and deliberation in the study committees at all levels beforehand, and only the secretarial system of the study committee conveyed it, the leaders at all levels failed to reach complete agreement ideologically, so the spirit was not implemented consistently; even individual study leading cadres held resistant ideas, making the grading work unable to be completed according to the scheduled requirements, and causing many unnecessary disputes and fluctuations, which instead affected the study. In the process of studying the commentaries on the White Paper, many comrades did not pay attention to this study due to a lack of universal ideological mobilization. The study of the united front issue achieved better results, which was because ideological mobilization was emphasized beforehand.

(4) The study method mainly focuses on collective self-study, breaking the old-fashioned method of "one person reading and everyone listening," which has yielded greater results. For cadres with generally low levels and a poor theoretical foundation, who cannot fully understand the problems with pure self-study and discussion, supplementary lectures, reports, and answers to questions are provided. This point has also been proven by one year of practice to be a better experience.

　　冀省直属机关总学委会
　  总结一年干部学习
    已学完社会发展史政治经济学干部养成了长期坚持学习习惯
    【本报讯】河北省级各直属机关的全体干部，已在今年内有组织的学完了社会发展史和政治经济学，不少干部在规定计划外还自学了若干理论书籍，学习理论的空气大大提高，一般已养成长期坚持学习的习惯，很多同志以耽误学习为损失。总学委会在一年来干部学习的总结中指出，经过理论学习，一般同志初步获得了阶级斗争及社会发展的一般规律，开始懂得了研究社会的发展如何联系中国问题。不少干部加强了劳动生产观念，对研究经济问题有了兴趣，了解到不研究经济工作就无法了解社会，不能解决社会问题。同时，对资本主义的实质也有了较深的了解，部分同志检讨了过去曾或多或少地迷惑于资本主义的若干表面繁荣景象，而不知道其内部的腐朽与矛盾，因之对资本主义各国的政治、经济、文化，作了某些过高的估计；学习后对资本主义内在的不可克服的矛盾有了初步认识，增长了对帝国主义的鄙视；一部分同志更清算了自己若干资产阶级的错误观点；此外并丰富了政治经济的一般知识，为进一步学习理论准备了条件。在学习的领导方面，对一般干部的文化政治理论水平有了较正确的了解，对领导在职干部学习取得了一定经验，诸如方针、计划、编级及学习方法等都有了较适当的解决。
    政策学习方面，一年来有组织的学习了中共二中全会材料，毛主席的论人民民主专政，新华社评白皮书各社论，人民政协重要文献及统一战线问题材料，这些文献对干部教育极大，特别是二中全会材料与论人民民主专政，使大家丰富了很多政治经济知识，解决很多糊涂观念与怀疑问题，学习后大家都感到“搞通了”，对转变与提高干部思想作风有极大作用。在政协文献与统一战线问题学习中，暴露糊涂观念与怀疑思想更多，部分干部存在的狭隘关门主义思想已基本解决；这特别直接帮助了改进新老干部关系。但对评美帝白皮书社论的学习则不很深入，其原因主要是领导方面未能深入动员，一般干部不重视，认为自己对美帝早有了解，未能虚心深刻钻研检讨。
    总结中提供了几点主要经验：
    学习开始时，强调集体自修，以养成学习习惯；学习制度初步建立后，须加强思想指导，以期学习深入下去。
    （一）加强组织领导，严格掌握制度，是树立学习的有力方法。河北省今年由原冀中、冀南、冀东三行政区合并组成，三地区领导机关在年前或年初已先后开始理论学习，并均有经常的政策学习，但学习重点、编级标准和学习进度各不相同。合省后，组织了省级直属机关的总学委会，党政军民最高负责人均亲自参加，并设置专职秘书。由总学委会统一领导各级分支学委会，解决了编班、统一教材、划一进度等问题；制定了会议、汇报、测验、总结、解答问题、学习考勤等制度，使学习得以顺利坚持下去。经验证明，在开始学习时，应强调集体自修，这对克服大家的散漫习惯，养成学习习惯上有很大作用。但在学习制度已初步建立后，必须适时加强思想指导，及时逐级帮助，排除学习障碍，才能巩固与深入学习，提高学习情绪，反转来有利于组织领导的推进。总学委会在这方面还作得不够，各级分支会亦未能负责集中与研究学习中的疑难问题。以致使某些干部因个别简单问题未获及时解决而阻碍了学习的深入，影响学习情绪。有的问题一时不好解决的，亦缺乏必要的解释说明，增加了大家的思想负担。总学委会为此建议各分支会最好设置顾问组，专门研究与解答疑难问题。
    （二）负责同志本身积极学习并经常研究大家的学习情况，对推动学习运动有极大作用。因此各级领导干部应自觉努力学习；各级学委会也应抓紧督促机关的领导干部学习，不使其有特殊与例外情绪。
    （三）加强学委会的集体领导与深入普遍的思想动员相结合，是贯彻学习计划，深入学习的有力保证。九月份调整学习编级，因事先缺乏在各级学委会中广泛讨论酝酿，仅由学委会秘书系统传达下去，各级领导思想未能完全一致，因之贯彻精神也不一致；甚至个别学习领导干部抱有抵抗思想，使编级工作未能按预定要求完成，并造成很多不必要的纠纷与波动，反而影响了学习。在学习评白皮书社论过程中，因缺乏普遍思想动员，不少同志未重视这一学习。学习统一战线问题成绩较好，即因事先强调了思想动员。
    （四）学习方法以集体自修为主，打破老一套的“一人念大家听”的方法，收效较大。对于一般水平较低，理论基础较差，单纯自修与讨论尚不能完全搞通问题的干部，则辅之以讲解报告及解答问题，这一点也是为一年来实践所证明了的较好经验。
