(Jiaodong News) The Donghai Special District is paying attention to mass health and disease treatment. Each county has established a "Central Rescue Team" to fight against epidemics. At the same time, small-scale symposiums of traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners are held continuously to exchange experiences, improve techniques, and strengthen their concept of serving the masses. Therefore, once an epidemic is discovered, county, district, and local medical personnel can quickly mobilize for rescue. According to statistics, 36,995 patients have been rescued and cured in the past year. In the course of rescuing and treating epidemics, health education is first carried out among the masses to improve environmental hygiene. In many areas, farmers have paid attention to the cleanliness of livestock pens, pigsties, toilets, and courtyards. Some even use *Euphorbia helioscopia* to kill maggots, thereby greatly reducing the occurrence of epidemics. At the same time, the masses are educated to break superstition. There were 233 witch doctors in the district last year, and 111 have been transformed in one year. The returning demobilized workers and militiamen are generally examined by county hospitals and medical cooperatives, and those who are sick are treated. In the two counties of Wendeng and Rongcheng alone, 141 people were cured, preventing the influx of epidemics from other places. In addition, preventive vaccinations and smallpox vaccinations were carried out in spring and autumn, with about 240,000 people vaccinated and 64,000 people vaccinated, effectively preventing the spread of epidemics.

The district has also begun to systematically eradicate two chronic infectious diseases that have been prevalent for a long time: kala-azar and leprosy. Kala-azar has a history of more than 20 years in Weihai and is relatively difficult to treat. According to statistics from seven counties including Muping and Weihai, there are 3,022 patients. This year, the Donghai Special Commissioner's Office has adopted the policy of "government rescue, mass self-rescue, and focused eradication," and has successively used Kunlun, Muping, and other three places as medical priorities, curing 161 people. Yaqian, Rongcheng, Weihai, Rushan, Haiyang and other counties have also set up points and started treatment, absorbing experience to lay the foundation for comprehensive eradication.

The shortcomings in the district's health work are that the institutions are not sound, some new cadres transferred to health work are not familiar with the business, which weakens the leadership of health work, and the leadership of medical cooperatives is even worse. Most medical cooperatives can only maintain the status quo, and individual ones cannot even maintain it. In addition, when vaccinating against smallpox this year, there was a lack of inspection, and substandard vaccines were found, resulting in mostly negative reactions after vaccination, which damaged credibility among the masses and increased difficulties for future vaccination work.

### 东海专区重视群众卫生工作　一年抢治病人三万余  改进农家环境卫生大批改造巫婆

　　东海专区重视群众卫生工作
    一年抢治病人三万余
    改进农家环境卫生大批改造巫婆
    【胶东讯】东海专区注意群众的卫生与疾病治疗工作，各县设立“中心抢救组”，以与病疫作斗争；同时连续召开小型的中西医座谈会，以交流经验、提高技术并加强其为群众服务的观念。因之，一旦发现病疫，县区及各地医务人员即能迅速出动抢救。据统计，一年来经抢救治愈病人达三万六千九百九十五人。在抢治病疫当中，首先在群众中进行卫生教育，改进环境卫生，很多地区农民已注意牲口栏、猪圈、厕所，院子等的清洁，有的并用“猫眼棵子”杀蛆，因此大大减少了病疫的发生；同时教育群众破除迷信，全区去年有巫婆二百三十三人，一年中已改造了一百一十一名。各县对回家的复员民工、民兵，一般均由县立医院、医药社加以检查，有病的即予以治疗，仅文登、荣成的二县就治好了一百四十一人，杜绝了外地病疫的流入。此外，春秋两季有重点地进行了防疫注射及牛痘接种，共注射约二十四万人；种痘六万四千人，有效地制止了疫病的流传。
    该区并开始有计划地扑灭长期流传的两种慢性传染病——黑热病和痳疯。黑热病在威海已有二十多年历史，比较难治。据牟平、威海等七县统计，病者达三千零二十二人。今年东海专署采取了“政府抢救、群众自救、重点扑灭”的方针，先后以昆仑、牟平等三处作为医疗重点，已治好一百六十一名；牙前、荣成、威海、乳山、海阳等县也先后设点开始治疗，正在吸取经验，为全面扑灭打下基础。
    该区卫生工作中还存在的缺点是机构尚不健全，一部分新转入卫生工作的干部尚不熟习业务，减弱了对卫生工作的领导，对医药合作社领导更差，大部医药合作社只能维持现状，个别还有不能维持现象。此外今年接种牛痘时疏于检查，发现不良疫苗，结果接种后多系阴性反应，损失了在群众中的信用，为今后种痘工作增加了困难。
