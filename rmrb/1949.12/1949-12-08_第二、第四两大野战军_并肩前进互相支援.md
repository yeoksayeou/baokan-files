Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 7th: As our army pursued and annihilated the enemy westward along the Guangdong-Guangxi coast, the Second and Fourth Field Armies advanced and fought shoulder to shoulder, actively supporting each other in battle, demonstrating a high degree of class fraternity. On the 3rd of this month, when a unit of the Second Field Army was encircling and annihilating the headquarters of the enemy's 63rd Army in Gongguan Market, Hepu, some enemy troops stubbornly defended their fortifications and put up a desperate resistance. Furthermore, because the artillery of the People's Liberation Army had not yet arrived, the battle could not be resolved quickly. At this time, the artillery of a unit of the Fourth Field Army arrived in time and immediately and voluntarily coordinated their attack, swiftly annihilating the enemy. The entire Second Field Army was overjoyed by the arrival of the comrades from the Fourth Field Army, and the soldiers offered them their homes and proposed: "Not only will we fight shoulder to shoulder with the comrades of the Fourth Field Army, but we will also compete to see who runs faster and who can capture all the remnants of the White bandits."

　　第二、第四两大野战军
  　并肩前进互相支援
    【新华社华南前线七日电】在我大军沿粤桂海岸向西追歼敌人时，第二、第四两大野战军并肩前进作战，在战斗中主动互相支援，发挥了高度的阶级友爱精神。本月三日第二野战军某部在合浦公馆墟围歼敌人六十三军军部时，由于一部敌军坚守工事，进行垂死抵抗，并因为该部解放军炮兵尚未赶到，不能很快解决战斗。这时第四野战军某部炮兵适时到达，立即自动配合出击，迅速歼灭了敌人。第二野战军全军都为第四野战军同志们的来到而欢腾万分，战士们纷纷给他们让房子住，并且提出：“我们不但要和第四野战军同志们并肩作战，而且我们还要比赛，看谁跑得快，看谁能把白匪残部全部抓住。”
