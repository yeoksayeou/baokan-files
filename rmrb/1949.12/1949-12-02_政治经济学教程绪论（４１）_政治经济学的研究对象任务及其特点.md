  　Chapter Four: The Characteristics of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    Section One: The Scientific Nature, Unity, and Integrity of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    The research method of Marxist-Leninist political economy is like this. When analyzing economic phenomena, it starts from the concrete to the abstract, and then from the abstract to the concrete. When abstracting to a certain degree, it finds its most basic root or factor, just like finding the seed from observing the root of a tree, and the seed's development and growth constitute the tree. However, this abstract method must be combined with the concrete method. In research, it must go from the concrete to the abstract, and then from the abstract to the concrete. In narration, it must go from the abstract to the concrete. From the abstract to the concrete means from simple to complex, from low-level to high-level. The process from concrete to abstract must go through analysis, and the process from abstract to concrete must go through synthesis. Analysis must also be carried out during the synthesis process.
    The methods of concrete and abstract, analysis and synthesis, combined with other methods (such as induction and deduction), are used to narrate the theoretical results of the research, which is completely in line with the order of historical development and the procedure of logical development. This means that this theory is consistent whether viewed from the order of historical development or the order of logical development. This also means that the narration of the theory must be narrated according to the concrete historical development process, because the theoretical method and the historical method are actually consistent, and must be consistent. However, in comparison, historical development has more complex situations, often mixed with some individual accidental phenomena. For example: a person grows and develops gradually from fetus - infant - child - teenager - youth - adult - old age. Such a historical development process of a person is also the theoretical development process of a person. However, there may be some special and complex situations, such as if an infant is underdeveloped, he may not be able to walk in childhood; or if he has suffered from a serious illness or malnutrition during childhood, it may affect his healthy development. However, people generally grow and develop according to the process of fetus - infant - child - teenager - youth - adult - old age. Therefore, the theory of human growth is also established according to this growth and development process. If special factors are encountered in the development process, some twists and turns may occur in its development, but these are only special exceptions.
    The unified and complete system of Capital is not allowed to be changed arbitrarily
    Marxist-Leninist political economy studies and analyzes according to the development process of social and economic movements. Therefore, its theoretical system is consistent with the objective and actual development process of social and economic movements. Therefore, the Marxist-Leninist political economy theory system itself is also unified and complete. It has an immutable integrity. Marx's Capital is such a scientific, unified, complete, and systematic masterpiece of genius. As mentioned above, Capital not only has a correct, scientific, and philosophical foundation, but also has its consistent basic theoretical foundation of political economy, and this consistent basic theoretical foundation is the theory of surplus value. The entire Capital is based on the theoretical foundation of the theory of surplus value. The theory of surplus value is like a red line running through Capital. Based on the theory of surplus value, Marx analyzed the economy of capitalist society. In terms of the entire narrative method of the three volumes of Capital, it is a method from abstract to concrete. Volume One analyzes the process of capital production, Volume Two analyzes the process of capital circulation, and Volume Three analyzes the process of total capital production. The scope analyzed by the entire three volumes is the process of capitalist economic movement. In this analysis, Marx grasped the laws of capitalist economic movement and its transition to a higher-level social economy. Not only in terms of the entire content of the three volumes, each part is closely related, and the order cannot be changed at all. Even from each chapter and section of the three volumes, the entire book has 52 chapters, and its narration is either in historical order or in the method from abstract to concrete. Each chapter and section are also mutually related and take care of each other, and absolutely cannot be moved or changed arbitrarily. Anyone who arbitrarily changes the narrative system of Capital will destroy the narrative method of Capital, destroy Marx's methodology, and destroy the scientific, unified, and complete system of Capital.
    Therefore, although Capital does not encompass all economic phenomena in capitalist society, it has made the most correct, most basic, and most profound analysis and exposure of the economy of capitalist society. Therefore, Lenin once said: "Capital - this is nothing but a few comprehensive, closely linked ideas that combine the mountain of factual material." (Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks")
    The Destruction of Capital's System by Böhm-Bawerk, Kautsky, and Others
    The unified and complete system of Capital cannot be moved or changed arbitrarily. However, the traitors of the Second International Marxism, such as Böhm-Bawerk and Kautsky, arbitrarily changed the system of Capital, thereby destroying the complete system of Capital. For example, Böhm-Bawerk's "Popular Capital" (China had Li Ji's translation very early, which was later renamed Explanation of Capital), arbitrarily reversed the order of Marx's Capital and narrated it according to his own system, resulting in the vulgarization of Capital. Böhm-Bawerk did not grasp the characteristics of Marxist political economy. He thought that this reversal of order was for the convenience of readers' understanding, but he did not know that this reversal basically destroyed the complete system of Capital and destroyed the consistent method of Capital. For example, Kautsky's Marxist Economic Doctrine (China also had Hu Hanmin's translation of the Minzhi Bookstore edition very early, and later Wang Fuquan's translation of the Shenzhou Guoguang Society edition) also did not understand Marx's method. Therefore, his interpretation of the three volumes of Capital was not consistent with Marx. He mainly only explained Volume One of Capital, Volume Two was completely omitted, and Volume Three only explained a small part, and mixed wages as a distribution problem with capital income, so that he could not make a correct explanation of Capital according to Marx's method and popularize it. Therefore, Kautsky's betrayal of Marxism and becoming an accomplice of the imperialist bourgeoisie has its ideological roots here.
    The scientific nature, unity, and integrity of Marxist-Leninist political economy are roughly like this.
    The scientific nature, unity, and integrity of Marxist-Leninist political economy are characteristics that bourgeois political economy does not have.

  　第四章　马列主义政治经济学的特点
    第一节　马列主义政治经济学的科学性、统一性与完整性
    马列主义政治经济学的研究方法，就是这个样子。它对于经济现象内分析开始时是由具体到抽象，然后由抽象到具体，抽象到一定程度时，找出它一定的最基本的根源或因素来，好象上述由观察一枝树的根源最后找到了种籽，种籽发育成长才构成树一样。但这种抽象的方法必须结合具体的方法，在研究的时候，必须由具体到抽象，然后再由抽象到具体，在叙述的时候，则必须由抽象到具体。从抽象到具体，也就是从简单到复杂，由低级到高级。从具体到抽象必须经过分析，由抽象到具体，必须经过综合，综合过程中同时还必须进行分析。
    具体和抽象的方法，分析和综合的方法，并加以其他的方法（如归纳法和演绎法等），将研究的结果理论叙述出来，是完全符合于历史发展的次序，符合于逻辑发展的程序的。这就是说这种理论不论依历史发展的次序来看，或者照逻辑发展的次序来说，也都是符合的。这也就是说理论的叙述必须按照具体的历史发展过程来加以叙述，因为理论的方法与历史的方法，实际上是一致的，而且也必须是一致的。不过比较起来，历史的发展还有更复杂的情况，往往夹杂了某些个别的偶然的现象。例如：人是由胎儿——婴儿——孩童——少年——青年——壮年——老年这种历史发展过程次第成长发展起来的，这样一个人的历史发展过程同时也是人的理论的发展过程。但是其中还可能有某些特殊的复杂的情况发生存在，譬如如果婴儿发育不良，到儿童时代可能还有不会走路的，又如因为儿童时曾经罹害大病，或者营养不良，因此也可能影响他发育的不健全。但是人所成长一般地是按照胎儿——婴儿——孩童——少年——青年——壮年——老年的程序成长发展起来的，因此人生长的理论也是按照这成长发展过程建立起来的，如果发展过程中遇到特殊的因素，从而其发展也可能发生某些曲折，但这些只是特殊的例外。
    资本论的统一的完整的体系是不容许任意变动的
    马列主义政治经济学就是按照社会经济运动发展的过程来研究分析，因此，它的理论系统与社会经济运动客观实际的发展过程是符合一致的。从而，马列主义政治经济学理论系统本身也是统一的完整的。它具有不可变动的严整性。马克思的资本论便是这样一部科学的、统一、完整的、系统的天才巨著。既如上述，资本论不但具有正确的、科学的、哲学的基础，并且还有它政治经济学一贯的基本的理论基础，这种一贯的基本的理论基础，便是剩余价值说。资本论全部都建立在剩余价值学说的理论基础上，剩余价值学说好象一根红线一样贯串在资本论中。马克思以剩余价值学说为基础分析资本主义社会的经济，就资本论全部三卷的整修叙述方法来说，是由抽象到具体的方法，第一卷分析资本的生产过程，第二卷分析资本的流通过程，每三卷分析资本的总生产过程。整个三卷所分析的范围，就是资本主义经济运动的过程，在这分析中，马克思把握了资本主义经济运动及其向更高级社会经济推移的规律。不单就资本论三卷整个内容说来，各部分都是紧密地联系着，先后次序是丝毫不能变动的，即使从三卷每一篇每一章来说，全书共五十二章，其叙述或者是依历史的顺序，或者是依抽象到具体的方法，各章各节同样也都是互相关联，互相照顾，绝对不可任意搬移变动的，谁要任意变动了资本论叙述的体系，谁就破坏了资本论的叙述方法，破坏了马克思的方法论，破坏了资本论的科学的、统一的、完整的体系。
    因此，资本论虽然没有包罗了资本主义社会所有的一经济现象，但是它对资本主义社会的经济却作了最正确的、最基本的、最深刻的分析与暴露。所以列宁曾说：“资本论——这无非是几个有综合性的、彼此紧密联系着的、把堆积成山的事实材料结合起来的思想。”（列宁“哲学笔记”）
    博洽德考茨基等对资本论体系的破坏
    资本论的统一的完整的体系是不可经任意搬移变动的，但是第二国际马克思主义的叛徒们如博洽德、考茨基之流、就任意变动资本论的体系，从而破坏了资本论完整的体系，例如博洽德的“通俗资本论”（中国很早就有李季的译本，以后曾改名为资本论解说），把马克思资本论的次序任意颠倒，而依他自己的系统来叙述，结果是把资本论庸俗化了。博洽德没有把握住马克思主义政治经济学的特点，在他以为这种次序的颠倒是为了便利读者的了解，便是他却不知道这种颠倒基本上就是破坏了资本论的完整的体系，破坏了资本论的一贯的方法。又如考茨基的马克思主义经济学说（中国也很早有民智书局版的胡汉民译本，以后又有神州国光社版的汪馥泉译本），也是不懂马克思的方法，因此他对资本论三卷的解释，也不能和马克思一致，他主要的只是解释了资本论第一卷，第二卷却完全被略省掉了，第三卷也只解释了一个小部分，并且把工资当作分配问题来与资本收入混在一起，以致不能依照马克思的方法对资本论作一正确的解释而使之通俗化。所以以后考茨基的叛变马克思主义、变为帝国主义资产阶级的帮凶，在这里，是有着他思想上的根源的。
    马列主义政治经济学的科学性、统一性与完整性，大体上就是这样。
    马列主义政治经济学的科学性、统一性与完整性，是资产阶级政治经济学所没有的特点。
