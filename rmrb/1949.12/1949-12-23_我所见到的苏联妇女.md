　　The Soviet Women I Saw
　　Yu Fu
　　I returned from Moscow in October 1949. Among the many great things I constantly recall, the Soviet women made a very deep impression on me.

　　The train passed through Manzhouli and stopped for a while at Otborg, the first station in the Soviet Union. From the train window, I saw a locomotive on the opposite track puffing white steam. A person jumped out of the high cab door, skillfully and nimbly climbed onto the train in a few steps, wiped around those pipes for a while, and then straightened up, looking towards our train window. "Ah! A female driver!" With a cry of surprise, many Chinese people curiously gathered around. She was wearing a set of oil worker's clothes, standing against the wind, gazing into the distance. Her deep blue eyes shone with fortitude, and the white smoke set her off, she was practically a heroic bronze statue! I will never forget this image. She was the first Soviet woman I encountered!

　　We passed Lake Baikal and stopped for a longer time at a small station by the lake. People jumped off the train to walk around. At this time, two resting workers were leaning on the fence of the platform, with a metal toolbox at their feet, and it was clear that they were train inspectors. One of them was a woman, a wisp of dark hair showing under her headscarf, her cheeks flushed. We curiously gathered around. The male worker first asked us, "Mongol?" We replied, "No! China!" They both said in unison, "Oh! New China!" One of our comrades pointed to the female worker's toolbox. She made a gesture of labor, pointing to herself. The male worker patted her on the head, gave a thumbs up, and kept patting her on the shoulder, indicating to us that she was his good partner. She also smiled proudly. A whistle blew, and they hurriedly picked up their heavy toolboxes and ran to another train entering the station. For a long time, we watched their shadows! - Soviet women, working alongside men like this.

　　After visiting the Stalin Automobile Factory, we were very excited by the scientific machinery, modern methods, skilled techniques, and extremely high labor enthusiasm. Especially when we saw the great Soviet women sweating by the blazing blast furnaces, holding the control levers by the sparking pneumatic hammers, running around on the installation department's scaffolding, and busily moving back and forth on the high cranes (because this department was entirely electrically transported, so it never stopped), we were even more moved.

　　On Moscow's trolleybuses, eight or nine out of ten drivers are women. We also went to the four-story department store next to the Bolshoi Theatre to buy things. Inside, except for a very few specialized workers, almost all the shop assistants were women.

　　In the Lenin Collective Farm near Moscow, the female farmers participated in production and operated threshers and combine harvesters. They also engaged in sideline production such as cultivating fruit trees, electrically incubating chickens, beekeeping, and raising livestock. They set annual production plans and often exceeded their targets. They carried out production using modern agricultural scientific methods. As a result of their efforts, sideline income accounted for a very significant part of the farm's total income.

　　In addition to participating in labor, Soviet women, like men, participated in all social activities. For example, many of the representatives in the Supreme Soviet meetings were women.

　　We visited many museums and art galleries in Moscow. At each place, we were accompanied by a specially assigned guide. They could not only systematically introduce the origin of the museum, the lives of various heroes and painters, and the origins of historical treasures, but also use scientific viewpoints to critique these figures, treasures, and events. Take the guide at the Lenin Museum, for example. She had a deep understanding of the Russian Revolution and Lenin's life, almost like a university history professor. Only those with deep political and cultural cultivation can be qualified for this job. And most of these museum guides are great Soviet women!

　　In the field of artistic activities, Soviet women also occupy a considerable number. There are many female writers and singers and film actresses, and their artistic achievements are very high.

　　During the Soviet Patriotic War, all the Soviet people, under Stalin's call, acted to carry out a heroic and tenacious struggle against the German fascist invaders, and finally achieved victory. In the years of war, Soviet women bravely participated in frontline rescue, rear supply, and guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines to defend their homeland. After the war, wearing medals, they appeared in production and various work posts with diligent postures, for the prosperity of the Soviet motherland.

　　我所见到的苏联妇女
    于夫
    一九四九年十月从莫斯科归来，在我头脑里经常忆起的，除去其他许多伟大的事迹之外，苏维埃妇女也给我极深刻的印象。
    车过满洲里，在进入苏联的第一站奥特堡停了一些时候。我从车窗里看见对面轨道上一辆机车在那里冒着白气，从高高的车门里跳下一个人来，很熟练而敏捷的三下两下扒上车去，在那些管子中间拭抹了一阵之后，直起身来，望了一下我们的车窗。“呵！女司机！”一声惊叫，好多中国人都好奇的围上来。她穿着一身油工服，迎风站立，向路的远方眺望，她深蓝色的眼睛闪着刚毅的光芒，白烟烘托着她，简直是一尊英雄铜象呵！这影子我永远不会忘记的，她是我印象中第一个苏联妇女！
    路过贝加尔湖，在湖边的一个小车站停的久一些，人们都跳下车来走动走动；这时月台的栅栏上靠着两个休息着的工人，他们的脚下都放着一个铁工具箱，一看就知道是检车工人。其中有一个是女的，在包头的毛围巾下露出一缕黝黑的头发，面颊绯红。我们好奇的凑上前去，男工首先问我们：“蒙古？”我们答：“不！中国！”他俩都异口同声地说：“噢！新中国！”我们有一个同志指了一下女工的工具箱。她作了一个劳动的手势，指了指她自己。那男工拍了一下她的头项，翘起大姆指来，并不住的拍着她的肩膀，向我们表示这是他的好伙伴，她也得意的笑了。一声气笛，他俩赶忙提起沉重的工具箱，向驶进站来的另一列车奔去了，良久我们望着他俩的影子！——苏联妇女，就是这样和男子一道工作着。
    参观斯大林汽车工厂后，那些科学的机械，现代的方法，熟练的技术，极高的劳动热情等等，都使我们非常兴奋。尤其看到伟大的苏维埃妇女，她们在火红的大号鼓风炉旁流着汗，她们在火星四射的气锤旁握着操纵杆，她们在按装部的架子上跑来跑去，她们在架得很高的起重机上往来奔忙（因为这一部门是全部电气运送的，所以一刻不停），更是觉得感动。
    莫斯科的无轨电车上，十之八九是女司机。我们也曾到大剧院旁边的四层楼的大百货店去买东西，里面除去极少数的特殊工作者外，几乎全部是女店员。
    在莫斯科近郊的列宁集体农庄里，女庄员们参加着生产，并掌握着火＠①和组合机。她们还经营栽培果木，电气孵鸡、养蜂、养牲畜等副业生产。她们每年订出生产计划，而且经常超出任务，她们用近代的农业科学方法进行着生产，由于她们努力的结果，副业的收入占全农场收入的很主要一部分。
    苏维埃妇女除去参加劳动之外，也和男子同样，参加社会上的一切活动，譬如在最高苏维埃会议的代表里，有不少是女代表。
    我们参观过莫斯科很多的博物馆和艺术馆，每到一处就有专门负责讲解的向导员伴随着你。他们不仅可以把这博物院的产生，各个英雄、画家的生平、历史的珍品的来历，很有条理的给你介绍，而且用科学的观点来批判这些人物，珍品与事迹。拿列宁博物馆的向导员来说，她对俄国革命和列宁生平有很深刻的研究，简直象一个大学历史教授一样。唯有在政治、文化都有高深修养的人，才能胜任这一项工作。而这些博物馆向导员中，有大部分是由伟大的苏维埃妇女充担的！
    在艺术活动方面，苏联妇女也在占着相当的数量。有很多女文学家和歌舞电影演员，她们在艺术上的成就都是很高的。
    当苏联卫国战争期间，所有的苏联人民，都在斯大林的号召下面，行动起来，向着德国法西斯侵略者，进行了英勇顽强的斗争，而终于取得了胜利。在战争的年代里，苏维埃的妇女们为了保卫祖国，英勇地参加了前线的救护，后方的供应及敌后的游击队。战后，她们佩带着勋章，又在生产及各种工作岗位上，为了苏维埃祖国的繁荣，以勤劳的姿态出现了。
