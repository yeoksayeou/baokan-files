Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 20th. The Second Field Army Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army has issued a communiqué on the battle achievements since entering the Sichuan-Guizhou campaign, as follows:
　　　　(A) Course of Operations:
The People's Liberation Army's Second Field Army and Fourth Field Army troops, beginning in early November from the three counties of Yichang, Changde, and Shaoyang in the western Hubei-Hunan border region, advanced towards Sichuan and Guizhou, traversing the Wuling Mountains on the borders of Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guizhou. They annihilated the main forces of the remnants of Song Xilian and He Shaozhou's army groups, reaching the lines of the Wujiang River and Guiyang on November 15th and 16th respectively. They then continued to advance westward, again destroying the main forces of Luo Guangwen's troops and parts of Hu Zongnan's First Army and Thirtieth Army in the outskirts of Chongqing. On the 29th, they simultaneously attacked Qijiang from the east and west, seizing the opportunity to liberate Chongqing, the Kuomintang's wartime capital, on the 30th.
After our southern front troops reached Guiyang and Zunyi, He Shaozhou's bandit troops became even more disorganized and collapsed without a fight. We then took advantage of the victory and advanced rapidly northward, annihilating part of the 44th Army, a remnant of Luo Guangwen's forces, which fled westward along the Yangtze River. From the 3rd to the 8th, we successively occupied the key points of southern Sichuan, including Hejiang, Luzhou, Nanxi, and Yibin. In coordination with our troops advancing north from Chongqing, we expanded the results of the battle by pursuing and annihilating the remaining enemy forces.
In forty days, our entire line of troops advanced more than 3,400 li, forming an encirclement around the remaining bandit troops of Hu Zongnan, Song Xilian, and Luo Guangwen, who were huddled in the Chengdu Plain, and continued to annihilate the enemy.
