The state-owned trade departments of Heilongjiang Province have been vigorously purchasing surplus grain from farmers since the beginning of winter, actively supplying farmers' needs for winter living, and urban-rural material exchanges have been frequent and have achieved great results. More than 60 grain stations affiliated to the province's state-owned grain company began purchasing grain around October 1st, with the new grain entering the market in late September. They resolutely implemented the cotton-grain price ratio stipulated by the Northeast People's Government Commercial Department, which more than doubled farmers' purchasing power. As a result, farmers were unprecedentedly enthusiastic about selling grain, and the number of grain carts on the market increased nearly threefold compared to early October. The state's daily purchase of grain accounted for 60 to 90 percent of the grain on the market. As of the end of last month, the province's state-owned grain company's grain purchase results exceeded the original purchase plan for October and November by 106.8 percent; it has completed more than 83 percent of the province's total grain purchase task for 1950, and the quality has also greatly improved compared to previous years. It is expected that the province's total grain purchase task for 1950 will be fully completed and exceeded by the end of December.

At the same time as the grain purchase work, the province's state-owned department store also actively cooperated, selling large quantities of cloth, cotton, and various daily necessities to rural areas. More than 70 shopping malls in cities and counties under its jurisdiction are experiencing brisk trade. In October and November, nearly 300,000 bolts of cloth and more than 1,000 tons of cotton were supplied to farmers for seasonal needs, as well as large quantities of daily necessities such as kerosene, sugar, and matches. The total sales in the two months exceeded 107 percent of the province's company's cash recovery plan for the fourth quarter of this year, ensuring that the province's 4.5 million farmers could solve the needs for winter clothing and winter production. At present, the New Year is approaching, and the trade company is preparing large quantities of New Year goods to supply farmers in various places.

　　黑龙江省贸易部门大力收购余粮
    供给农村日用必需品
    【本报讯】黑龙江省国营贸易部门，入冬以来，大量收购农民余粮，积极供应农民冬季生活需要，城乡物资交流频繁，并已获得巨大成绩。该省国营粮食公司所属六十余个粮栈，随着九月下旬新粮开始上市，十月一日前后即普遍展开购粮工作，坚决执行了东北人民政府商业部规定的棉粮比价，使农民购买力增加两倍余。因此农民卖粮空前踊跃，粮车上市较十月初增加了将进三倍，国家每日购粮占上市粮食的百分之六十至九十。截至上月底止，全省国营粮食公司购粮成绩，已超过十、十一两月份原订收购计划的百分之一○六．八；已完成一九五○年度该省购粮总任务的百分之八十三强，且质量亦比往年大为提高。预计十二月底该省一九五○年度的购粮总任务即可全部完成并且超过。
    与购粮工作同时，该省国营百货公司亦积极配合，大量向农村推销布匹、棉花及各种日用品。所属各市、县七十余家商场，交易很旺。十、十一两月份共供给农民换季需要的布匹近三十万匹，棉花千余吨，其他煤油、糖、火柴等大批日用品。两月售货总额超过了该省公司今年第四季度现金回笼计划的百分之一○七，保证了该省四百五十万农民解决冬装与冬季生产的需要。目前新年快到，贸易公司正大批筹备年货，供应各地农民。
