Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 5th: The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government today issued the following explanation regarding the revised freight rates:

In order to ensure that various goods bear reasonable freight costs, strengthen the exchange of materials between regions, and meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production, the Ministry of Railways has re-adjusted freight rates. This has been submitted to and approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and orders all railways across the country to implement the new rates uniformly from December 6th. However, for stations south of Hangzhou (excluding Hangzhou) under the Shanghai Railway Administration, west of Luoyang (excluding Luoyang) under the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, and north of Gantian under the Hengyang Railway Administration, the implementation will begin on December 8th.

This adjustment unifies freight rates between the North and the South, implements a calculated mileage system with decreasing rates for longer distances to reduce the burden of long-distance freight transport, and adjusts freight rates for each grade according to the rise in the price index. After the adjustment, the difference between the highest and lowest grade freight rates is reduced from 200 times to 25.34 times, with the first grade being 1647 yuan per ton per kilometer and the twentieth grade being 65 yuan per ton per kilometer. Because the grade difference is reduced, less-than-carload (LCL) freight rates remain one time higher than carload rates. The freight rates for carload goods of each grade transported over 500 kilometers and 1,000 kilometers are listed below:

Grade　Freight for 500 km (per ton)　Freight for 1,000 km (per ton)
1　　781,172　　1,384,385
2　　703,386　　1,246,535
3　　627,973　　1,112,888
4　　555,879　　985,124
5　　487,580　　864,085
6　　424,024　　751,451
7　　365,685　　648,064
8　　309,717　　548,879
9　　258,019　　457,259
10　　215,332　　381,609
11　　179,285　　317,727
12　　147,981　　262,251
13　　121,420　　215,180
14　　98,654　　　174,834
15　　79,682　　141,212
16　　63,556　　112,633
17　　50,750　　89,938
18　　40,789　　72,287
19　　35,572　　63,041
20　　30,829　　54,635

The original classification of goods was too general in some areas. For example, paper was not differentiated by quality and was placed in the same grade; domestic medicinal materials were not differentiated by value and were also placed in the same grade; and industrial machinery was not differentiated by whether it was made of iron or wood. Now, they are classified according to their quality, value, and materials. To reward industrial production and encourage exports, basic chemical industrial products such as acids, alkalis, and salts, industrial machinery, and major export goods such as wool, tea, and medicinal materials have all been reduced in grade. In addition, certain inappropriate situations, such as needles, telephones, and rubber tires, have been adjusted accordingly. After the adjustment of goods grades and freight rates, not only will the freight burden for general goods tend to be more reasonable, but some goods will also see a reduction in freight costs. For example, the previously set freight rate for foreign tobacco leaves (now classified in the same grade as domestically grown tobacco leaves) transported 1,100 kilometers from Zhengzhou to Shanghai was 862,660 yuan. After the adjustment, it is 488,650 yuan, a freight reduction of 43 percent.

To take care of the long-distance transportation of several major goods, special prices have been set. Coal transport over 1,000 kilometers is reduced by 15 percent; over 1,500 kilometers is reduced by 30 percent. Kiln pillar transport over 500 kilometers is reduced by 30 percent. Other items, such as special handicrafts produced in Beijing, are reduced by 40 percent, and imported cotton and re-exported export materials such as bristles, tea, tung oil, raw silk, and tea bricks are reduced by 50 percent.

Passenger baggage and parcel freight rates are unified between the North and the South. The original baggage freight rate was calculated at the fourth-grade parcel rate for baggage not exceeding 50 kilograms. After the adjustment, it will be calculated at half the fourth-grade parcel rate.

Miscellaneous fees have also been appropriately adjusted, generally lower than the rate of increase in the price index. For shunting fees, the original rate was 9,120 yuan per car per kilometer in the North and 11,400 yuan per car per kilometer in the South. Now, it has been changed to a uniform rate based on the original Southern rate, so there is no increase in the South.

　　铁道部调整货等运价
　  货物按其优劣列等征收运费实行通算里程递远递减负担
    【新华社北京五日电】中央人民政府铁道部今日发布改订货等运价说明如下：
    为使各种货物合理负担运费，加强各地物资交流，配合工农生产需要，铁道部重新调整货等运价，经呈请政务院财政经济委员会批准，通令全国各路自十二月六日起一体实行，但对上海局杭州以南（杭州除外）、郑州局洛阳以西（洛阳除外）、衡阳局淦田以北各站，规定自十二月八日起实行。
    此次调整，将南北货物运价统一，实行通算里程的递远递减，减轻长途货物运输负担，并切合物价指数上升情形，分别调整各等级运价。调整后，最高等级与最低等级运价差额由二百倍缩小为二五．三四倍，一等每吨每公里一六四七元，二十等每吨每公里六五元。因等差缩小，零担运价仍维持高于整车一倍。兹将各等整车货物运送五百公里及一千公里运费列后：等级　运送五百公里运费（每吨）　运送一千公里运费（每吨）１　　７８１，１７２　　１，３８４，３８５２　　７０３，３８６　　１，２４６，５３５３　　６２７，９７３　　１，１１２，８８８４　　５５５，８７９　　９８５，１２４５　　４８７，５８０　　８６４，０８５６　　４２４，０２４　　７５１，４５１７　　３６５，６８５　　６４８，０６４８　　３０９，７１７　　５４８，８７９９　　２５８，０１９　　４５７，２５９１０　　２１５，３３２　　３８１，６０９１１　　１７９，２８５　　３１７，７２７１２　　１４７，９８１　　２６２，２５１１３　　１２１，４２０　　２１５，１８０１４　　９８，６５４　　　１７４，８３４１５　　７９，６８２　　１４１，２１２１６　　６３，５５６　　１１２，６３３１７　　５０，７５０　　８９，９３８１８　　４０，７８９　　７２，２８７１９　　３５，５７２　　６３，０４１２０　　３０，８２９　　５４，６３５
    原定货物等级，若干地方过于笼统，如纸未分优劣，统列在一个等级内；国产药材未分贵贱，亦统列一个等级；工业机械未分铁制、木制。现分别按其优劣、贵贱、质料之不同而分别列等。为奖励工业生产，鼓励出口，对基本化学工业品酸、碱、盐、工业机械，大宗出口货物如羊毛、茶叶、药材，均减低其等级。此外对若干个别不当情形如针、电话机、橡胶车胎，均分别予以调整。货等、运价调整之后，不但一般货物运费负担趋于合理，而且有些货物减少了运费，如前定洋烟叶（现已与旱烟叶同列一等）由郑州运至上海一千一百公里，原订运费为八六二，六六○元，调整后合四八八，六五○元，运费减低百分之四十三。
    为照顾几种主要货物长途运输，分别订定特价。煤运在一○○○公里以上减百分之十五；一五○○公里以上减百分之三十。窑柱运行五○○公里以上减百分之三十。其他如北京出产特种手工艺品减百分之四十，进口棉花及转口出口物资如猪鬃、茶叶、桐油、生丝、茶砖减百分之五十。
    行李及包裹运价南北统一。原订行李运价在不超过五十公斤时，按四级包裹运价率计费，调整后改按四级包裹价率减半核收。
    杂费费率亦予以适当调整，一般均低于物价指数上升程度。对于调车费，原订北方每车每公里九一二○元，南方每车每公里一一四○○元，现改为统一按原订南方费率计费，南方并未增加。
