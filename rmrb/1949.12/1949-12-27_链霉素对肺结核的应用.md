The recently emerged Streptomycin, appearing like a panacea, is considered by some as a specific drug for pulmonary tuberculosis. Every pulmonary tuberculosis patient hopes to try it, and some who have not had the opportunity to use it are inevitably disappointed. Some doctors also misuse it. What kind of special effects does this agent have? What is its value in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis? It is important to study this. Based on the literature of the past few years, the usage and precautions of this agent for pulmonary tuberculosis are briefly introduced below, so that everyone can have a more correct understanding:

Since Waksman first discovered Streptomycin in 1944, there have been nearly hundreds of articles on the treatment with this agent. Although the use of this agent is still in the research stage, at least today this agent can indeed be said to be one of the better antibiotics. Many bacterial infectious diseases that have failed to respond to previous methods can be treated with this agent to a greater or lesser extent. However, the exact efficacy and scope of use of this agent still need to be further studied in the future.

To date, we do not know much. Since Waksman succeeded in in vitro experiments and first tried it on guinea pigs to confirm its effectiveness, it was then applied to humans. Over the past four or five years, thousands of cases have been treated. Based on the treatment experience of these cases, it is known that this agent has an inhibitory effect on the progression of tuberculous lesions. However, this effect is also subject to certain conditions, that is, the effectiveness of this agent gradually decreases or even disappears completely during the treatment of tuberculosis. The reason for this is probably the drug resistance of the tuberculosis bacteria itself, that is, a resistance of the bacteria to this agent. This resistance appears as early as the fifth week of medication and usually within 60 to 90 days. The appearance of this resistance makes the use of this agent completely meaningless. This is one of the precautions that should be taken when using this agent for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.

In terms of the type of pulmonary tuberculosis, the type that is more effective for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis is the acute type with rapid fever and hemoptysis. If the time has been too long and it has become chronic, such as cavitary type or other proliferative induration type, it is mostly ineffective, because the effective period of this agent is only a short two to three months, but before it can take effect, the bacteria have already developed resistance, losing the drug effect of this agent. Therefore, when this agent is applied to the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, there should be certain selection principles for its type. This is the second of the precautions that should be taken when using this agent for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.

The types of diseases that have been more successful with this agent, such as newly developed exudative pulmonary tuberculosis, where the destructive changes in the lungs are not too extensive, and the general symptoms are significant, and the patient's resistance is low, then this agent should be used intensively within the effective period of two to three months. Whether it is effective or not can be judged by the following criteria: (1) The patient's cough and sputum are reduced; (2) Hemoptysis is reduced; (3) Appetite is increased, so the patient's weight increases in a short period of time; (4) The general condition improves. This should be prepared to continue the second stage of treatment. If this agent is used for several weeks to one or two months and still has no effect, it can be stopped and does not need to be used again. This is the third of the precautions that should be taken when using this agent for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.

Even if the above effects are seen with the cooperation of this agent, it does not mean that the tuberculous lesions have been cured. If it is allowed to go unchecked at this time and other therapies are not continued, the disease may recur. Therefore, when using this agent, it should be used simultaneously with rest, artificial pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum, and other general regular pulmonary tuberculosis therapies at the same time as the acute symptoms subside. In short, this agent is only one of many pulmonary tuberculosis treatment methods and must be used in conjunction with other methods to achieve real therapeutic effects. This is the fourth of the precautions that should be taken when using this agent for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.

In addition, some types of pulmonary tuberculosis, such as early infiltration and other general symptoms that are not very significant, should not be used rashly. At this time, it is best to implement two to three months of recuperation therapy, which will mostly be effective. If the condition does not improve after two or three months, then consider the use of this agent. This is the fifth of the precautions that should be taken when using this agent for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.

In short, when selecting this agent for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, if the above precautions are fully considered, it will not only be a waste of expensive drugs, failing to achieve any therapeutic effect, but also may cause side effects such as the following eighth cranial nerve palsy. At the same time, the use of this agent should be known to be effective only within a certain range. It is by no means the so-called specific drug that is imagined by the general public to have the effect of a panacea, or that can treat all pulmonary tuberculosis. To reiterate, this agent is only one of many pulmonary tuberculosis treatment methods and must be used in conjunction with other therapies to achieve real therapeutic effects.

Regarding the treatment of tuberculous meningitis, I would also like to mention that this agent is more effective in the early acute stage of the disease. The use of this agent can temporarily alleviate the disease, and even reduce the fever within a few days, and consciousness can be restored. If it can be used continuously, this situation can be extended for several months. However, once the use is stopped, all symptoms recur. At this time, even if this agent is used again, it often does not have the same effect as when it was first used. Therefore, in general, the therapeutic effect of this agent on tuberculous meningitis is not significant. Whether the appearance of this agent can reduce the mortality rate of tuberculous meningitis is still a question, and it can only be said that it only temporarily alleviates the condition.

In the past, the dosage of this agent was relatively large, at a daily dose of 2-3G. After continuous use, many side effects are likely to occur. The most annoying of these is paralysis of the eighth cranial nerve. Once this nerve paralysis occurs, it is extremely difficult to recover. In the past year or two, based on the results of clinical experience, the dosage can be reduced to 0.5-1G per day, and the efficacy is the same, while the above-mentioned side effects can be avoided. In addition, the side effects of this agent also include occasional local pain at the injection site [similar to histamine reaction], rash, hematuria, etc. However, these are mostly temporary phenomena, and after stopping the use, these side effects can be eliminated.

　　链霉素对肺结核的应用
    北京总院  刘经邦  杨开济
    近来以仙丹灵药姿态出现的链霉素，（Ｓｔｒｅｐｔｏｍｙｃｉｎ）被人认为是肺结核的特效药。每一个肺结核患者，都希望一试，甚至一些未能得到使用机会的人，不免因而失望。有些医生也滥行试用，本剂究竟有什么样的特效？对于肺结核病的使用价值又如何？很应该加以研究。根据最近几年来的文献，将本剂对于肺结核的用法和注意事项，简单介绍如下，使大家有个比较正确的认识：
    链霉素自一九四四年Ｗａｋｓｍａｎ氏首先发现至今四五年以来，关于本剂的治疗文献，将近数百篇之多。本剂的使用虽仍未脱离研究的阶段，但至少在今天本剂的确可以说是很好的抗生素（Ａｎｔｉｂｉｏｔｉｃ）之一种。许多细菌性传染病，用以往方法，未能奏功的，本剂或多或少可以表现出一些治疗效果。但本剂的确实功效和使用范围，尚有待于今后的继续研究。
    截至今日为止，我们所能知道的事项并不算多，自从Ｗａｋｓｍａｎ氏在试管内试验成功，先试用于荷兰猪（Ｇｕｉｎｅａ—ｐｉｇ）确定有效之后，才应用于人身。四五年来，也是数千个病例，根据这些病例的治疗经验，知道本剂对于结核性病变的进行，是有制抑的作用，但是这种作用，也受着一定的条件限制，就是说本剂在结核治疗的过程当中，逐渐的效力减少甚至完全失掉。考其原因：大概是结核菌本身上所发生的抗药作用，也就是细菌对本剂的一种抗拒作用；这种抗拒作用，最早在用药的第五周，普通在六十至九十天内出现。这种抗拒作用的出现，使这本剂的使用完全失掉意义，这是本剂用于肺结核治疗时应行注意事项之一。
    就肺结核的病型来说，对肺结核治疗，比较有效的病型，是急骤发热咯血的急性病型，如时间经过已久，转为慢性的，如空洞型或是其他增殖型硬变型等之类，多半无效，因为本剂的使用期限，只有短短的两三个月，但未能收效以前，细菌已经发生抗拒作用，失掉了本剂的药效。所以本剂应用于肺结核的治疗时，对其病型应有一定的选择原则。这是本剂用于肺结核治疗时应行注意事项之二。
    本剂使用比较有成效的病型，如新发生之渗出性肺结核，肺内破坏性变化不太广泛，而一般症状显著，患者的抗病能力较低时，则使用本剂要在两三个月的有效期限内抓紧使用。收效与否，可用下列的标准来窥测：（１）患者的咳嗽喀痰减少，（２）咯血减少；（３）食欲增加，因之患者体重在短期内加重；（４）一般全身状态转好。这是应当准备继续作第二个阶段的治疗。如果本剂用到数周至一两个月仍毫不见效时，可以停止不必再用。这是本剂用于肺结核治疗时，应行注意事项之三。
    本剂的合作即使见到上述的功效，但也并非就是结核性病变已经治愈的表示。这时如果放任，不再继续用其他疗法时，则本病仍可复发。所以使用本剂，应在使用的同时，和在急性症状消退之后并用休息，人工气胸气腹等等一般正规的肺结核疗法。总之本剂只是许多肺结核治疗方法之一，必须和其他方法相辅使用，才能收到真正的治疗效果。这是本剂用于肺结核治疗时应行注意事项之四。
    此外有些肺结核的病型，如早期浸润等一般症状不太显著的，不宜冒然就用本剂，这时最好先实施两三个月的休养疗法，多半就可以见效。两三月后如果病情仍不见轻，这时再考虑使用本剂的问题，这是本剂用于肺结核治疗时应行注意事项之五。
    总之，对肺结核治疗选用本剂时，如果有充分考虑到上述各项注意事项，则不但徒然浪费高价的药品，不能收到丝毫的治疗效果，而且还可能发生下述第八脑神经麻痹等副作用。同时本剂的使用，应知只有在一定范围之内有效。决不是一般人所想象的有仙丹灵药作用，或是能治疗一切肺结核的所谓特效药。重复来说本剂只是许多肺结核治疗方式之一，必须和其他疗法相辅使用，才能收到真正的治疗效果的。
    关于结核性脑膜炎的治疗问题，也附带的提一下，本剂对本病的早期急性阶段较为有效。本剂的使用可以使病势一时转轻，甚至几天之内热度下降，意识可以重新恢复，如能继续使用，这种情况可以延长到几个月之久。但是一旦停止使用之后，一切症状又都复发。这时即使再用本剂，也往往没有最初使用时所能见到的功效。所以一般来说，本剂对于结核性脑膜炎的治疗效果不算大，是否本剂的出现，能使结核性脑膜炎的死亡率减低，还是一个疑问，也只能说仅仅是使病情一时见轻而已。
    本剂的用量以往都较为大，每日量为二—三Ｇ，这样连续使用之后，容易发生许多副作用。其中最讨厌的是第八脑神经的麻痹，这种神经麻痹一旦发生以后，是极难恢复的。近一、二年来根据临床经验的结果，用量可以减少到每日○．五——一Ｇ，功效一样，而上述的副作用可以避免。此外本剂的副作用，尚有偶发的注射局部疼痛【类似组织毒（Ｈｉｓｔａｍｉｎ）的反应】、发疹、血尿等。但这些多半是一时性的现象，停止使用之后，这些副作用也都可以随之消灭的。
