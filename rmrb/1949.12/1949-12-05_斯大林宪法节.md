　　Stalin Constitution Day

　　On January 31, 1924, the Second All-Union Congress of Soviets approved the first Constitution of the Soviet Union. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the great leader Stalin, after the implementation of two five-year plans since 1924, tremendous changes have taken place in the Soviet Union's economic, social, and political life: a new socialist industry has been successfully established, the rich peasant class has been eliminated, the collective farm system has achieved victory, crises, poverty, unemployment, and bankruptcy have disappeared forever, and the economic and political contradictions between workers, peasants, and intellectuals have been increasingly reduced and eliminated. The socialist public ownership of the means of production has been established as the foundation of Soviet society in the Soviet national economy. This socialist victory has made the Soviet electoral system more democratic—the implementation of a universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot election system has been guaranteed. This tremendous change requires a new constitution to reflect the actual situation of socialist society and to affirm the victories already won by the Soviet working people. Thus, the Constitutional Special Committee, established on February 7, 1935, under the leadership of Stalin, initially formulated the draft of the new Soviet Constitution. After five months of discussion by the people of the whole country, they unanimously expressed their support for the new constitution. The Eighth Extraordinary Congress of Soviets, held in November 1936, conducted detailed discussions and unanimously approved it on December 5. This is a constitution that guarantees the victory of socialism and worker-peasant democracy. This new constitution is the fruit of the victory won by the Soviet people in the struggle for human liberation. The great ideas it embodies have worldwide historical significance. It not only mobilizes the Soviet people to continue to achieve new victories in the process of moving towards a communist society but is also a guiding star in the democratic struggles of the people of the world.

　　This new constitution was created under the leadership of the genius leader Stalin. Therefore, the people of the entire Soviet Union call it the Stalin Constitution and designated the day of its approval—December 5—as the Soviet Union's Constitution Day, which is commemorated every year. This is the highest respect of the Soviet people for the great achievements of the great leader Stalin.

　　斯大林宪法节
    一九二四年一月三十一日第二届全苏联苏维埃代表大会批准了苏联第一部宪法。苏联人民在联共党及伟大领袖斯大林领导之下，一九二四年以后，经过两个五年计划的实行，至一九三五年，苏联的经济、社会、政治生活中皆发生了巨大的变化：新的社会主义工业已创立成功，富农阶级被消灭了，集体农庄制度取得了胜利，危机、贫困、失业和破产现象已永远绝迹，工人、农民以及知识分子间的经济上政治上的矛盾日益降低和泯灭。生产资料的社会主义公有制在苏联国民经济中已经奠定为苏维埃社会的基础。这个社会主义的胜利，使苏联选举制更加民主化——实行普遍的、平等的、直接和不记名投票的选举制有了保证。这种巨大的变化就需要一个新的宪法，来反映出社会主义社会的实际情况，与肯定苏联劳动人民已获的胜利。这样，一九三五年二月七日在斯大林领导下成立的宪法专门委员会就初步制定了苏联新宪法草案，全国人民经过五月之久的讨论，一致表示赞成新的宪法。一九三六年十一月召开的第八届非常苏维埃代表大会作了详细的讨论，于十二月五日一致赞同和批准。这是一部保证社会主义和工农民主胜利的宪法，这部新宪法是苏联人民在人类解放斗争中获得的胜利果实。它所体现的伟大思想具有着全世界历史的意义。它不仅动员苏联人民在走向共产主义社会进程中要继续取得新的胜利，而且是世界人民民主斗争中的一颗北极星。
    这部新宪法在天才领袖斯大林领导下缔造的，因此，全苏联人民称之为斯大林宪法，并将批准这部宪法的日子——十二月五日定为苏联的宪法节，于每年举行纪念。这是苏联人民对伟大领袖斯大林丰功伟业的最高尊敬。
