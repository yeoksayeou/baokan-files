    在庆尚北道北部的奉化县，十一月六日一天，就有农民三千四百余人起义。起义农民在凤城、明湖、才山等区散布传单，上面写着：“农民们起来向反动地主索还土地”，“打倒李承晚卖国政府”，“恢复人民委员会”等口号，并召开群众大会，清算反动分子。十一月四日，该道北部安东县陶山区农民一千余人起义，配合人民游击队，袭击伪区公所和“民保团”。从十一月七日到九日的三天内，安东县体安区农民二百余人，英阳县青把区农民四百余人，盈德县知品区农民七百余人，庆州县川北区农民四百余人，也纷纷举行起义。
    在庆尚南道西部山清县的新等区，有七百五十余农民，曾于十一月七日群起配合人民游击队，袭击伪区公所和金融合作社。农民们在举行群众大会，清算反动分子之后，已随同人民游击队返回智异山地区。
