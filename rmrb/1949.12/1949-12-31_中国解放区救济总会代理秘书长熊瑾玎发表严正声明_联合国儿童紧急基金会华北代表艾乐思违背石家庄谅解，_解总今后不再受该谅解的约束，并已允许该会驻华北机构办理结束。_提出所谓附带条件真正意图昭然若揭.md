Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 30th: Xiong Jin Ding, the Acting Secretary-General of the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association, issued a statement regarding the violation of the understanding reached jointly in Shijiazhuang in August 1948 with the Relief General Association by Alers, the North China representative of the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund. He announced that due to Alers' violation of this understanding, it has lost its practical significance, and the Relief General Association will no longer be bound by it. The United Nations Children's Emergency Fund sent its representative, Alers, to the Chinese Liberated Areas last year, intending to purchase appropriate materials worth $500,000 (later increased to $750,000) to be used for "relief" for children in the Liberated Areas, and an understanding was reached with the Relief General Association in Shijiazhuang at the end of August. The understanding stipulated that the Relief General Association would "implement the distribution and other handling of the imported materials according to the plan agreed upon by both parties until the materials are consumed or used." However, Alers, the Fund's North China representative, not only failed to fulfill the agreement already established by both parties but also violated the provisions of the understanding, demanding complete control over the distribution and storage of the imported materials. Alers also stated that if China did not accept this condition, the Fund's North China office would prepare to withdraw, attempting to use this as a threat. Xiong Jin Ding, the Acting Secretary-General of the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association, has allowed the twelve personnel of the Fund in Beijing to complete all their affairs before the end of January 1950. The statement is as follows:

Statement by Xiong Jin Ding, Acting Secretary-General of the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association

Based on the letter from Dr. Alers, the North China representative of the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund, dated August 27, 1948, and the reply from the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association dated August 30, 1948, the Shijiazhuang Understanding was established. However, after the understanding was established, Dr. Alers did not work according to the spirit of the understanding. In this regard, the main facts for more than a year are:

Alers Violates the Understanding - Proven by More Than a Year of Facts

	One, both parties agreed that the first batch of materials would arrive before the end of December 1948, but in fact, the first batch of materials did not arrive until March 1949.

	Two, the first batch of materials was only worth $100,500, about one-seventh of the stipulated $500,000 and the later increased amount of $750,000. In the nine months from March to December 1949, no further materials arrived.

	Three, the total number of the first batch of materials was 824 boxes, of which fiber paper and hand towels accounted for 304 boxes, which were not needed by our side.

Under these circumstances, we have discussed with Dr. Alers many times to improve the situation, but he has not shown any real intention to improve the situation.

Before Dr. Alers returned to the United States, we sent a letter on September 22nd of this year, urging him to follow the spirit of the Shijiazhuang Understanding, to quickly transport the materials remaining in Hong Kong to Tianjin, to use all the remaining funds to purchase black fever treatment drugs needed by our side, and to complete the amount of $750,000 worth of materials before the end of December 1949. However, in his reply on September 24th, Dr. Alers completely ignored this reasonable suggestion and asked us to accept his so-called certain attached conditions. He did not explain the content of the so-called certain attached conditions. Based on the facts of previous discussions, it refers to a condition that has been disputed for a long time and that we cannot agree to, namely, complete control over the distribution and storage of the imported materials. He also said that if we do not accept the so-called attached conditions in the letter, the Fund's North China office would prepare to withdraw.

At this point, the true intention of Dr. Alers to consistently violate the Shijiazhuang Understanding has become obvious. After Dr. Alers returned to the United States, he gave a speech claiming that $750,000 had been spent in liberated China (according to a Reuter dispatch from Lake Success in the Shanghai North-China Daily News on November 5th), which is completely inconsistent with the facts. Dr. Alers, representing UNICEF, insisted on his unreasonable conditions, violated the Shijiazhuang Understanding, and has rendered the Shijiazhuang Understanding without any practical significance. Therefore, I must solemnly declare that we will no longer be bound by the Shijiazhuang Understanding from now on. At the same time, we must point out that the facts prove that the materials left by Dr. Alers in Hong Kong were not intended to be transported to the Chinese Liberated Areas, but were intended to be used as a condition for bribing the Chinese people to bow to American imperialism. We will not be bribed and will not bow to American imperialism, so he will "distribute this batch of materials elsewhere."

In order to facilitate the closing of the UNICEF North China office, we have allowed the twelve personnel of the Fund in Beijing to complete all their affairs before the end of January 1950.

　　中国解放区救济总会代理秘书长熊瑾玎发表严正声明
    联合国儿童紧急基金会华北代表艾乐思违背石家庄谅解，解总今后不再受该谅解的约束，并已允许该会驻华北机构办理结束。提出所谓附带条件真正意图昭然若揭
    【新华社北京三十日电】中国解放区救济总会代理秘书长熊瑾玎顷就联合国儿童紧急基金会华北代表艾乐思违背一九四八年八月于石家庄与解总共同达成之谅解一事发表声明，宣布由于艾乐思违背这一谅解，已使这个谅解失去实际意义，解总不再受其约束。联合国儿童紧急基金会曾于去年派遣其代表艾乐思前来中国解放区，拟以五十万美元（后增至七十五万美元）购买适当之物资，作为“救济”解放区儿童之用，并于八月底与解总在石家庄成立了一个谅解书。谅解书中并规定由解总“按照双方所同意之计划执行所运入物资之发放及发放以外之处理，直至物资消费或使用”。但该会华北代表艾乐思不仅不履行双方已成立的协议，并违背谅解书的规定，要求对运入物资的发放和保管之全部控制权。艾乐思并称：中国如不接受此项条件，该会驻华北机构即准备撤退，企图借此威胁。中国解放区救济总会代理秘书长熊瑾玎乃允许该会在京的十二个人员在一九五○年一月底以前全部结束他们的事情。声明如下：
    中国解放区救济总会代理秘书长熊瑾玎声明
    根据联合国儿童紧急基金会华北代表艾乐思大夫一九四八年八月二十七日来函及中国解放区救济总会于一九四八年八月三十日复函，曾经成成立了石家庄谅解，但谅解成立之后，艾乐思大夫并未根据谅解的精神进行工作。在这一方面，一年多的主要事实是：
    艾东思违背谅解　一年多事实为证
    一、双方曾协议一九四八年十二月底以前，运到第一批物资，事实上延至一九四九年三月才运到第一批物资。
    二、第一批物资仅值美金十万零五千元，约为规定之五十万美元及后来增加至七十五万美元的数额的七分之一。一九四九年三月到十二月的九个月中，没有继续运到任何物资。
    三、第一批物资总数为八二四箱，其中纤维纸和手巾纸竟占三○四箱，这些东西均非我方所需要。
    在这种情况下，我们曾和艾乐思大夫多次商谈，以图改进，但他迄无真正改善这种情况的表示。
    在艾乐思大夫返美之前，我们曾于今年九月二十二日函促其遵照石家庄谅解精神，将留存香港之物资迅速运到天津；将剩余款项，全部购买我方需要之黑热病治疗药品，并须于一九四九年十二月底以前，完成运到七十五万元美金物资之数额。乃艾乐思大夫在其九月二十四日复函中，对此合理意见，完全置之不理，而要我们接受其所谓一定的附带条件。他没有说明所谓一定的附带条件的内容，根据历次谈话的事实，系指争执颇久而我们决不能同意的一项条件，即是对运入物资的发放和保管之全部控制权。他并且说，我们如不接受该函所谓附带条件，该会驻华北机构即准备撤退。
    至此，艾乐思大夫一贯违背石家庄谅解之真正意图，已昭然若揭。艾乐思大夫返美后，竟发表谈话称：已在解放了的中国化用七十五万美元（根据沪字林西报十一月五日成功湖电讯），这是完全与事实不符的。艾乐思大夫代表联合国国际儿童紧急基金会，坚持其无理条件，违背石家庄谅解，已使石家庄谅解失去了任何实际意义。因此，我不得不严正声明：我们今后不再受石家庄谅解的约束。同时，我们必须指出：事实证明，艾乐思大夫留存香港的物资，并不是准备运到中国解放区的，而是企图用以作为贿买中国人民向美帝国主义低头的条件，我们不受贿买，不向美帝国主义低头，他便要将这批物资“另行分配他处”。
    为了便利于联合国国际儿童紧急基金会驻华北机构的结束，我们允许该机构在北京的十二位人员在一九五○年一月底以前全部结束他们的事情。
