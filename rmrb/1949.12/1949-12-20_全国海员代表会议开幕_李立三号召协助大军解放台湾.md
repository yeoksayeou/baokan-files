Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 18th: The National Seamen's Representative Conference opened in Beijing at 2:00 PM today. Sixty representatives from twenty-four units, including the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Dalian, Zhenjiang, and Wuhu, attended the conference. Thirty-four representatives attending the National Store Employees Union Work Conference also attended as observers. After the conference unanimously approved the list of the presidium of the conference proposed by the National Seamen's Work Committee, Comrade Liu Dachao, the chairman, delivered the opening speech, followed by a speech by Li Lisan, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Vice-Chairman Li first praised the heroic struggle history of Chinese seamen against imperialism and foreign capitalists in the past. He said: The Hong Kong seamen's great strike in 1925 was the first historically significant event in the Chinese workers' movement and greatly promoted the entire Chinese workers' movement. He pointed out that Chinese seamen should continue to carry forward their glorious traditions in the future. First, they must bravely assist the People's Liberation Army in the final battle to liberate all of China in the upcoming struggle to liberate Taiwan and Hainan Island. Second, they must assist the government in mobilizing seamen to salvage and repair sunken ships, organize civilian ship transportation capacity, and smash the difficulties in our transportation work caused by the sabotage and blockade of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Third, they should protect the interests of seamen themselves by concluding collective contracts, organizing seamen's mutual assistance, and establishing seamen's clubs in various places. Fourth, they must unite with international workers. In the past, Chinese seamen suffered various unequal treatments and exclusion on foreign ships, which caused some seamen to have a general idea of opposing foreigners. The trade union should pay special attention to raising the class consciousness of seamen workers in the future and recognize that it is foreign capitalists, not foreign workers, who caused this situation. Chinese seamen should actively unite with international seamen and strive for them to join us in opposing imperialism. Finally, Comrade Li Lisan emphasized that to accomplish the above tasks, seamen workers must be organized. Due to the mobility of seamen, the focus of seamen's union organization work should be on ships, and it should be carried out with particular care.
    At the meeting, Qiu Jin, deputy director of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, Wang Jiyi of the Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, Huang Xuefu, a hero who protected ships of the Shanghai Continental Company's Dasheng Wheel, and Song Laiguang, a hero who supported the front on the Nanjing China Merchants Bureau's Feitian Wheel, all spoke.
    At the end of the conference, congratulatory telegrams to the conference from the preparatory committees of the Central China, Wuhan, and Shanghai Federations of Trade Unions and the Shanghai Seamen's Union were read.

　　全国海员代表会议开幕
  　李立三号召协助大军解放台湾
    【新华社北京十八日电】中华全国海员代表会议，今日下午二时在北京开幕。到会有全国总工会、上海、天津、武汉、青岛、广州、大连、镇江、芜湖等地二十四个单位代表六十人。出席全国店员工会工作会议的代表三十四人，亦列席旁听。大会一致通过由全国海员工作委员会所提出的大会主席团的名单后，由主席刘达潮同志致开幕词，继由中华全国总工会副主席李立三讲话。李副主席首先对过去中国海员对帝国主义及外国资本家的英勇斗争史迹加以赞扬。他说：一九二五年香港海员的大罢工，是中国工人运动第一件大有历史意义的事，对中国整个工人运动有莫大的推动。他指出：中国海员今后应继续发扬过去的光荣传统，第一，要勇敢地在不久的将来解放台湾、海南岛的斗争中，大力协助解放军作解放全中国的最后一战。第二，协助政府动员海员打捞和修理沉船，组织民船的运输力，粉碎因美帝国主义及蒋匪的破坏封锁所给予我们运输工作的困难。第三，用订立集体合同、组织海员互助、在各地普设海员俱乐部等办法来保护海员自己的利益。第四，要团结国际工人。过去中国海员在外国船上受到种种不平等待遇及排斥，使得某些海员发生笼统反对外国人的思想，工会今后应该特别注意提高海员工人的阶级觉悟，认识造成这种情形的是外国资本家，而非外国工人。中国海员要积极地去团结国际海员，争取他们和我们一道共同反对帝国主义。最后，立三同志着重说明，要完成以上任务，只有把海员工人组织起来。由于海员有流动性的特点，海员工会组织工作的重点，应放在船上，而且要特别细密地去进行。
    会上，天津市总工会筹委会副主任丘金，交通部航务局王寄一，上海大陆公司大生轮护船英雄黄学富，南京招商局飞天轮支前英雄宋来光都讲了话。
    大会结束时，宣读了的华中、武汉、上海等地总工会筹委会和上海海员工会致大会的贺电。
