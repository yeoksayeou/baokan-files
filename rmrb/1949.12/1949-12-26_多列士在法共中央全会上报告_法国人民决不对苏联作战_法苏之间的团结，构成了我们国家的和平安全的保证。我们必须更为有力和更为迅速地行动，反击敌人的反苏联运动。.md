Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 25th - TASS, Paris, 15th: French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez delivered a report at the French Communist Party Central Committee plenary session titled "The French People Will Never Fight Against the Soviet Union."
    Thorez began his report by stating that he was satisfied with the extensive discussions at the plenary session based on the reports by Duclos, Fajon, and Cogniot regarding the recent Cominform meeting. At the same time, he criticized this discussion as somewhat "academic." He said that the shortcoming in the first part of the plenary session's work was that the participants did not draw the conclusions necessary for the party's practical activities.

    Thorez continued: "As early as the beginning of this year, we French Communists appropriately and vigorously raised a decisive question – war or peace. At that time, we gave a clear answer to the question posed to the working people, democrats, patriots, and all our friends, and to the questions posed by the enemies of the people who tried to confuse us. But if we are to continue to move forward, if we are to truly realize the tasks we face, then we must make new efforts.

    Now, we are focusing our activities on the struggle to defend peace and national independence. Without striving for the unity of the working class and the unity of all forces for democracy and peace, without opposing all attempts by class enemies to ideologically influence the working class and our party, without waging a relentless struggle against all agents of the imperialists who provoke new wars, especially the Tito clique of spies and fascist murderers, we cannot victoriously carry out this battle.

    The first conclusion drawn from the Cominform resolution is that the democratic camp has grown undeniably.”

    Thorez then discussed the achievements of Soviet communist construction, the achievements of the construction of people's democratic countries, the victory of the Chinese revolution, the upsurge of the colonial national liberation movement, and the consolidation of the Communist Party and the growth of peace forces.

    Thorez pointed out: For the first time in history, there is an organized peace front, and this peace front offers us hope: the struggle for peace will result in victory. However, this does not mean that the danger of war has been eliminated or reduced. Due to the contradictions within the imperialist camp and the failure of the Marshall Plan, the American and British imperialists want to seek a way out in war. Going to suicide and promoting disaster is the nature of adventurers. But the possibility of thwarting the war-mongers' plans exists. The Communists, fighting in the forefront, can turn this possibility into reality. We would be making a major mistake if we underestimate the danger of a new war that the imperialists are brewing. But, similarly, it is a huge mistake to underestimate the strength of the working class, the strength of the democratic movement, and the strength of the freedom-loving people of all countries. These forces, united and acting vigorously, can and will force the war instigators to retreat. Therefore, we must constantly intensify our explanatory work, expose covert war preparations, redouble our efforts to educate the masses, and convincingly explain to them the dangers that threaten them.

    Thorez cited the remarks of several reactionary newspapers regarding the failure of the Marshall Plan, the rearmament of West Germany, and the Atlantic Pact. Thorez said: "At our Montreuil conference, I explained the flattery and hypocrisy of Schuman's repeated statements. The restoration of German power, both economically and militarily, has caused corresponding panic in France and all of Germany's neighbors. Now, they are already discussing the establishment of eleven German divisions. Reactionary newspapers are increasingly blatantly talking about the rearmament of West Germany.

    Adenauer (referring to the puppet prime minister of West Germany) demanded in a threatening tone that German troops enjoy the same rights as the troops of other Western European countries. We must refute some provocative statements made by Lamartine and Queuille, such as the so-called 'defense line on the Elbe River.' In order to justify the rearmament of West Germany, the war makers will naturally claim that East Germany is establishing a German army. This is purely provocation."

    Thorez then exposed the hypocritical and lying news of the reactionary newspapers, especially Le Figaro (referring to the organ of the Popular Republican Movement), which is particularly good at this; he exposed the newspaper's rumor-mongering campaign about Stalin's historic telegram to the leaders of Democratic Germany, Pieck and Grotewohl. Thorez briefly described the main points of the Soviet Union's policy towards Germany.

    Thorez said: It is clear that the Soviet Union—a socialist country which exerted unprecedented efforts in the great anti-fascist patriotic war—cannot establish for itself imperialist purposes of narrow revenge. Stalin—the leader of the victorious army—is the defender of justice, democracy, and peace. He is also the most authoritative spokesperson of the international proletariat and communism.

    Along the Leninist Road, the French and German People Will Advance Side by Side.
    Regarding the past and future relations between the French and German people, Thorez said: We have provided the only correct path, a path consistent with our national interests and the proletarian internationalism that inspires us. We have never confused the German people with their butchers, and now we are more clearly than ever distinguishing between the German workers and the revived German trusts and cartel giants (with whom our ministers are colluding). We will not forget that the German labor movement brought the immortal authors of the "Communist Manifesto" to the international proletariat. The German people, like us and all the working people of the world, will advance along the Leninist road. Now that Stalin's congratulatory telegram to the German people has been published, we hold the same view, namely, that the coordination and unity between the Soviet Union and Germany will make any European war impossible. How can we not cheer for this? Stalin's congratulatory telegram put an end to the conspiracies of the American and British imperialists, and put an end to all their hopes of basing their aggression plans on Germany.

    The Cominform resolution emphasized the role of the Soviet Union as the main force of the peace camp. We have never stopped thinking and saying this: we are proletarians, we love the first country that overthrew the bourgeoisie and achieved socialist victory; we are French, and we are concerned about the safety and future of this country, which gained independence through the sacrifices of the Soviet people. The solidarity between France and the Soviet Union constitutes a guarantee of peace and security for our country, while anti-Soviet policies and hatred of communism will once again lead to disaster and enslavement. Our statements in October 1948 and February 1949 were approved by all sincere French people, they resonated and became a warning to the war-mongers. The French people do not want war. They will never fight against the Soviet Union. On the eve of the seventieth birthday of our beloved and great Stalin, we re-emphasize this point. We are infinitely grateful for the kindness that the Soviet Union, the Bolshevik Party, and Stalin have given us. Communists, no matter where they are, whether they are working or fighting, should always remember this truth: the Soviet Union is the hope and guarantee of the victory of socialism on a global scale.

    At this point, Thorez emphasized: We must act more forcefully and quickly to counter the anti-Soviet movement of the enemy—a movement that is coordinated with the overall plan for war preparations. We should also counter the slanderous movement against the people's democratic countries in the same way.

    Thorez, when discussing the French ruling class's preparations to participate in the anti-Soviet war, stated: France's current war production itself is still insignificant. They plan to equip French soldiers—the future "cannon fodder"—with the assistance of outdated American surplus war materials. The billions of dollars allocated to the war budget will primarily be used to purchase rotten American stocks. But will the French people agree to the transportation and unloading of these dead weapons? In our country, the organization of real "open" areas and real "foreign occupation zones" can already be vaguely foreseen. The struggle for peace will increasingly take on the character of political struggle and mass struggle. Cowards who shrink back in the face of the difficulties of the struggle should remember Lenin's words: there is no revolutionary struggle without sacrifice, and no victory without sacrifice. The Cominform resolution reminds us from time to time that the war-mongers are intensifying their repressive actions and acts of terror because they have to try to ensure the security of their rear in order to wage an anti-Soviet war.

    Thorez further emphasized: Fighting for peace is the basic responsibility of communists. However, the struggle for peace cannot make us abandon the economic struggle. We must support the immediate and vital demands of the working people. Communists entrusted by the trade union masses with trade union leadership must be the best organizers of the struggle to realize these demands. The mobilization of the masses, like their struggle, is of decisive importance. Thorez called on communists to use all means to help develop the movement for peace and freedom among women and youth, to raise vigilance, and to develop united action.

    Thorez, in discussing the policies of the French Socialist Party, pointed out: Due to its treacherous policies, the Socialist Party is now in a state of complete decline. It is in the throes of a crisis, which is a crisis of its influence, a crisis of cadres, a crisis of leadership, a crisis that even extends to those leaders whose prestige has not been questioned in the slightest. It is necessary to point out the following characteristic situation:

    The leaders of the right-wing Socialist Party are no longer merely servants of their own bourgeoisie, they have openly become pawns of American imperialism. And, like the bourgeoisie of all countries that have tied their fate to the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty, they are also trying to overcome contradictions by relying on the omnipotent American imperialism. All these Social Democrats, these members of the Committee of the International Socialist Conference, are the same, whether they are Saragat-style socialists who have the closest relationship with the Americans, or Romita-style socialists who have the closest relationship with the British Labour Party and the Bevanites, all those who declare support for Blum or other similar leaders - all such people, in the final analysis, are subject to the same ideological and practical leadership of the United States. The leaders of "Workers' Force" and other splintered trade union organizations have also submitted to the leadership of Brown and the pawns of the American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organizations.

　　多列士在法共中央全会上报告
　  法国人民决不对苏联作战
    法苏之间的团结，构成了我们国家的和平安全的保证。我们必须更为有力和更为迅速地行动，反击敌人的反苏联运动。共产党人站在战斗最前列战贩计划必可挫败
    共产党人站在战斗最前列
    战贩计划必可挫败
    【新华社北京二十五日电】塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：法国共产党总书记多列士在法共中央委员会全会上发表题为“法国人民决不对苏联作战”的报告。
    多列士在报告中首先指出：他对全会上根据杜克洛、法戎及郭尼奥关于最近共产党情报局会议所作的报告而展开的广泛讨论，感到满意。同时，他又批评这一讨论多少有些“学院”性。他说，全会工作第一部分中的缺点是：参加会议者没有得出党的实际活动所必需的结论。
    多列士继称：“早在今年年初，我们法国共产党人就恰当而大力地提出了一个决定性的问题——战争还是和平。那时候，我们对劳动人民、民主分子、爱国分子及我们的一切朋友所提出的问题，和企图使我们混乱的人民之敌所提出的问题，给了明确的答复。但是，如果我们要继续前进，如果我们真要实现我们所面临的任务，则我们必须作新的努力。
    现在，我们把我们的活动集中于保卫和平与民族独立的斗争。不争取工人阶级团结及民主与和平的一切力量的团结，不反对阶级敌人在思想上影响工人阶级和我们党的一切企图，不对挑动新战争的帝国主义分子的一切代理人、特别是间谍与法西斯杀人犯的铁托匪帮进行无情的斗争，则我们便不能够胜利地进行这一战斗。
    根据情报局所通过的决议得出的第一个结论便是：民主阵营已无可争办地成长起来了。”
    多列士继而论及苏联共产主义建设的成就，人民民主国家建设的成就，中国革命的胜利，殖民地民族解放运动的高涨，以及共产党的巩固与和平力量的增长。
    多列士指出：历史上第一次有了一个有组织的和平阵线，这一和平阵线向我们提供了一个希望：争取和平的战斗，其结果将是胜利的。但是，这并不就表示战争的危险已经消除或者缩小了。由于帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾和马歇尔计划的失败，美、英帝国主义分子想在战争中寻求出路。走向自杀，促进灾难，乃是冒险家的天性。但是，挫败战争贩子的计划的可能性是存在的。站在最前列战斗的共产党人，能够把这一可能性变为现实。如果我们过低估计帝国主义者正在酝酿的新战争的危险，我们将犯重大错误。但是，同样地，过低估计工人阶级的力量，民主运动的力量，爱好自由的各国人民的力量，也是巨大错误。这些力量团结起来，大力行动，就能够而且将会迫使战争挑拨者退却。因此，我们必须不断地加紧解释工作，揭露暗中的战争准备，加倍努力教育群众，并令人信服地向他们说明威胁着他们的危险。
    多列士引证若干反动报纸关于马歇尔计划失败、重新武装西德以及大西洋公约的言论。多列士说：“在我们的蒙特勒伊会议上，我曾经说明舒曼历次声明的浮夸性和伪善性。在经济与军事两方面，德国威力的恢复，在法国和德国的一切邻邦中引起了相应的惊慌。现在，他们已经在讨论着要成立十一个德国师。反动报纸愈来愈露骨地到谈到重新武装西德的问题。
    阿登纳（按系西德傀儡总理）以威胁的口吻要求准许德国的军队和其他西欧国家的军队享有一样的权利。我们必须驳斥拉马第及葛义等所发的一些挑衅声明。例如所谓‘易北河上的防线’等。为了辩解西德的重新武装，战争制造者自然要扬言什么东德正在建立德国军队。这纯然是挑衅。”
    多列士继而揭露反动报纸特别是精于此道的法国报纸黎明报（按系人民共和运动党机关报）的伪善撒谎的消息；他揭露该报关于斯大林致民主德国领袖皮克与格罗提渥的历史性电文的造谣运动。多列士扼要叙述了苏联对德政策的要点。
    多列士说：很明显地，以前所未闻的努力进行了伟大的反法西斯主义卫国战争的苏联——社会主义国家，不能为自己确立帝国主义的目的狭隘的报复目的。斯大林——胜利军队的领袖——是正义、民主、和平的捍卫者。他并且是国际主义的无产阶级的共产主义的最权威的发言人。
    沿着列宁主义的道路法德人民将齐步前进
    关于法国人民与德国人民过去和未来的关系，多列士说：我们提供了惟一正确的道路，这一道路与我们的民族利益和鼓舞着我们的无产阶级国际主义精神相一致。我们从来不曾把德国人民和他们的屠夫混淆过，而现在，我们比以前任何时候更为清楚地划清了德国工人和复活了的德国托辣斯和卡迭尔巨头（我们的部长们与之勾结的就是这些人）之间的界线。我们不会忘记：德国的劳工运动给国际无产阶级带来了“共产党宣言”的不朽作者们。德国人民将如我们和世界上全体的劳动人民一样，沿着列宁主义的道路前进。现在，斯大林给德国人民的贺电发表了，我们抱着同样的意见，即苏联和德国之间的协调一致，将使任何欧洲的战争成为不可能。我们怎能不为之欢呼呢？斯大林的贺电结束了美英帝国主义者的阴谋，并且结束了他们把侵略计划寄托在德国身上的全部希望。
    情报局的决议，着重指出了作为和平阵营主要力量的苏联的作用。我们从来不曾停止过这样想和这样说：我们是无产阶级，我们热爱第一个推翻了资产阶级、获得了社会主义胜利的国家；我们是法国人，我们担心这个由于苏联人民的牺牲而得到独立的国家的安全和前途。法苏之间的团结，构成了我们国家的和平安全的保证，而反苏政策和对共产主义的憎恨，则将再度招致灾祸和奴役。我们在一九四八年十月和一九四九年二月所作的声明，为一切真诚的法国人所赞许，它们得到了共呜，成为对战争贩子们的一个警告。法国人民不要战争。他们决不对苏联作战。我们在我们亲爱和伟大的斯大林七十寿辰的前夕，重新着重申述这一点。苏联、布尔什维克党和斯大林所给予我们的恩惠，是我们感激不尽的。共产党员无论在什么地方，不管他是在劳动或是在斗争，都应该牢记着这个真理：苏联是全世界范围社会主义胜利的希望和把握。
    至此，多列士着重说：我们必须更为有力和更为迅速地行动，反击敌人的反苏运动——这一运动是配合着战争准备的总计划的。我们也同样应该反击对人民民主国家的诬蔑运动。
    多列士谈及法国统治阶级参加反苏战争的准备时称：法国本身目前的战争生产还不足道，他们计划以过时的美国剩余战争物资的援助，来装备法国的士兵——未来的“炮灰”。战争预算的亿万拨款的用途，首先就是购买霉烂了的美国存货。但是，法国人会同意让这些死亡的武器运输和起卸吗？在我们的国家内，组织真正的“开放”的区域和真正的“外国占领区”的事情，已经约略地可以预见。争取和平的斗争，必将日益加甚地带有政治斗争和群众斗争的性质。在斗争的困难前面退缩的胆怯者，应该记得列宁的话：没有不牺牲的革命斗争，也没有不牺牲胜利。情报局的决议不时地提醒我们：战争贩子们正在加紧他们所采取的镇压行动和恐怖行动，因为他们不得不力图确保他们后方的安全，以便进行反苏战争。
    多列士进一步强调指出：为和平而斗争，是共产党员的基本责任。但是，争取和平的斗争，不能使我们抛开经济斗争。我们必须支持劳动人民的眼前的切身要求。被工会群众委托以工会领导的共产党人，必须是为实现这些要求而斗争的最好组织者。群众的动员，也正如他们的斗争一样，具有决定的重要性。多列士号召共产党员以一切方法，帮助在妇女和青年当中展开争取和平与自由的运动，提高警觉性，并发展联合的行动。
    多列士在谈到法国社会党的政策时指出：由于它的叛卖政策，社会党现在完全处于衰落状态。它处在危机的痛楚之中，这就是它的影响的危机，干部的危机，领导的危机，这种危机甚至及于那些威信迄未受过丝毫责疑的领袖。指出下面这一具有特点的情况是必要的：
    右翼社会党的领袖，已不再只是他们自己资产阶级的仆役，他们已经公开变成美国帝国主义的走卒了。并且，正如一切把自己的命运与马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约结合起来的国家的资产阶级一样，他们也力图用投靠于号令一切的美国帝国主义的办法来克服矛盾。所有这些社会民主党人，这些国际社会党会议委员会的人们，都是一样，无论是与美国人关系最密切的萨拉盖特式社会党人，或是与英国工党和贝文派关系最密切的罗米塔式社会党人，一切宣告支持勃鲁姆或其他同类领袖的人——一切这样的人，归根都是服从于同一美国的思想的与实际的领导。“工人力量”和其他分裂出去的工会组织的领袖们，也已服从于布朗和美国劳联与产联的走卒的领导。（附图片）
