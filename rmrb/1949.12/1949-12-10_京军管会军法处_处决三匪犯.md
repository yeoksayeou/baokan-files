Beijing Military Control Commission Military Law Office Executes Three Bandits

[Beijing News] The Military Law Office of the Beijing Military Control Commission, in response to the demands of the general public, held a military trial for the murderers and criminals Zheng Zhanjiang, Meng Lin, and Su Zhenxi, who seriously disrupted public order and dared to fire their weapons to resist arrest, and sentenced them to death. The executions were carried out by firing squad at the Tianqiao execution ground on the afternoon of December 9th. Accomplices in each case, Li Yunzhang and Zhang Shulin, were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.

Zheng Zhanjiang was originally a platoon leader in the Kuomintang's puppet 101st Army. After being demobilized and sent home following the liberation of Beijing, he did not engage in production but instead engaged in various illegal activities that disturbed public order and disrupted social order. On June 1st, he shot and killed Li Jiangxin at 96 Xianmen Avenue, and when resisting arrest, he shot and injured Zhang Yongshan, head of the patrol corps, in the head, and killed citizen Chen Xianxi.

Meng Lin was originally a soldier in the Kuomintang's puppet 271st Division and had consistently engaged in anti-people activities. As early as 1947, he murdered Li Youheng, a village cadre in his hometown of Xincheng County. After the liberation of Beijing, he refused to be reorganized and colluded with puppet soldiers Zhang Shulin, Xue Zhirong, Wang Huichen, and others to plot armed robbery. On the 25th day of the third month of the lunar calendar, the criminals robbed the Dade Long Grain Store outside Qianmen East Liulichang, nearly strangling shop assistant Liu Huien to death, and stealing gold rings, fabrics, and other valuable property.

Su Zhenxi served as a Kuomintang police officer and a puppet civil affairs bureau employee, oppressing the people and acting tyrannically. On June 20, 1947, he strangled Kui Wenxiang to death with a cloth belt. Although the case was solved by the puppet police局 and sent to the puppet court for trial, it was delayed for more than a year until liberation, and no judgment was ever made.

These rogue soldiers and bandits, some of whom committed many evils before liberation, killing people and robbing people's property, and some of whom continued to endanger revolutionary order after liberation, daring to fire their weapons to resist arrest and injure military police and citizens, were extremely cunning and evasive in the trial, showing no remorse. The families of the victims and the general public have filed accusations against these heinous counter-revolutionaries. The Military Law Office of the Military Control Commission accepted this just demand and sentenced the main criminals in each case, Zheng Zhanjiang, Meng Lin, and Su Zhenxi, to death according to law. Although the accomplices in each case also had their own crimes, they knew how to confess and repent. In accordance with the lenient policy of the People's Government, the Military Law Office sentenced them to various terms of imprisonment according to law, so that they could reform themselves through education. Li Yunzhang in the Zheng case was sentenced to three years of imprisonment. Zhang Shulin in the Meng case was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, Xue Zhirong was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment, Wang Rong was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, and Wang Huichen fled in fear of punishment and will be dealt with separately after being apprehended. Other accomplices in each case were mostly coerced and knew how to repent of their past mistakes during the interrogation. After being educated by the Military Law Office, they were released.

　　京军管会军法处
  　处决三匪犯
    【北京讯】北京市军事管制委员会军法处接受广大市民要求，对严重破坏治安，并胆敢鸣枪拒捕的杀人凶犯郑占江、孟林、苏振玺等三名举行了军事审判并判处死刑，于十二月九日下午于天桥刑场执行枪决。对各案中之从犯李云章、张树林等分别判处各等有期徒刑。
    郑占江原为国民党伪一○一军排长，北京解放后，经整编遣散回家后，不事生产，专事各种扰乱治安、破坏社会秩序的非法活动。六月一日在西安门大街九十六号击毙李江信，并鸣枪拒捕，将纠察总队张永山头部击伤，将市民陈献玺击毙。
    孟林原为国民党伪二七一师士兵，一贯从事反人民活动，早在一九四七年即杀害其故乡新城县村干部李有恒。北京解放后拒不受编，并勾结伪军张树林、薛志荣、王惠臣等，主谋武装抢劫。旧历三月廿五日，该犯等在前门外东琉璃厂大德隆粮栈抢劫时，几将伙友刘惠恩勒毙，抢去金戒指、布匹等贵重财物甚多。
    苏振玺历充国民党警察及伪民政局雇员，欺压人民，蛮横成性。一九四七年六月二十日以布带将奎文祥勒毙，该案虽经伪警局破获，送伪法院审理，但拖延年余，直到解放，迄未判决。
    这些兵痞匪徒，有的在解放前就作恶多端，杀害人民生命，抢劫人民财产，有的在解放后继续危害革命秩序，胆敢鸣枪拒捕，杀伤军警及市民，在审理中复避重就轻狡猾异常，毫无悔过表示，各案受害家属及广大人民对此罪大恶极的反革命分子，纷纷提出控诉。军管会军法处接受了这一正义要求，依法将各案主犯郑占江、孟林、苏振玺等三人判处死刑。各案从犯，虽亦各有罪行，但因尚知坦白悔过，依据人民政府宽大政策精神，军法处分别依法判处各等有期徒刑，以使其在教育中改过自新。计郑案中的李云章判处有期徒刑三年。孟案中的张树林判处有期徒刑七年，薛志荣判处有期徒刑九年，王荣判处有期徒刑一年，王惠臣畏罪潜逃，待获案后另结。各案中其他从犯，多系被胁迫性质，在审讯中尚知痛悔前非，经军法处教育后释放。
