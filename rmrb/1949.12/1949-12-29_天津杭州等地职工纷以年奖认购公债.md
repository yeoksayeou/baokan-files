    [This newspaper's dispatch] The upsurge of workers in Tianjin, Hangzhou, and other places subscribing to Victory Public Bonds is continuing to develop. All employees of the Tianjin Municipal Industry Bureau and the Municipal Enterprise Company subscribed to more than 1,500 shares of public bonds in one day on the 26th. The crew of the "July 1st Commemoration" locomotive of the Tianjin Railway Bureau's Tianjin District Locomotive Depot used four-fifths of the 500,000 yuan bonus they received in September for saving more than 70 tons of coal to pre-purchase Victory Public Bonds. The crew of another locomotive also pre-purchased public bonds with part of the bonus they received for saving coal. The students of the political study class of the Tianjin Tram Company have pre-purchased 75 shares of public bonds, and they are calling on workers inside and outside the factory to subscribe together. Employees of the Tianjin Postal Administration Bureau also expressed their desire to purchase public bonds with their year-end bonuses.
    Workers in Hangzhou are also enthusiastically subscribing to public bonds. Some employees of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway are subscribing to public bonds with their entire year-end bonuses.

Employees of Zhejiang Daily purchased more than 1,600 savings units in one evening.
