Kaifeng's cultural and educational work, after a year of rectification and transformation, has laid the foundation for the future development of New Democratic education.

Kaifeng is the cultural heart of Henan. At the beginning of its liberation last November, there were more than 100 universities, middle schools, and primary schools, with over 20,000 students, concentrated in Kaifeng along with other cities in Henan. At that time, the People's Government, adhering to the principle of "maintaining the status quo and carrying out necessary and possible reforms," took over public schools, registered and reviewed private schools, and vigorously restored them. First, temporary relief was provided to teachers and students in various schools, classes were reorganized, and lectures were held for teachers and students, explaining the People's Government's urban policies and its attitude towards intellectuals. Subsequently, a preparatory committee for the Municipal Student Union was established, becoming the core organization for students throughout the city. At that time, 85 middle and primary schools were restored, and 14 middle schools from various places in Bian were mobilized to return to their original locations. Necessary assistance was provided to private middle schools that were well-run. These measures, along with the reception of libraries, museums, and people's education centers, initially stabilized the chaotic state of the cultural and educational circles at that time.

During the winter vacation last year, the Bureau of Culture and Education trained 700 primary and secondary school teachers in the city, and the preparatory committee of the Student Union also held student lectures, conducting political and current affairs studies. They actively cultivated a group of politically progressive and pure teachers and established a democratic management system in various schools.

This summer vacation, the province and city jointly held a summer teacher seminar, attended by more than 100 primary and secondary school principals and academic affairs directors. They studied Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and the New Democratic education policy, with good results. As of now, the city has one university with more than 3,000 students, 15 secondary schools with 6,390 students, and 73 primary schools with 2,775 students.

Simultaneous with the restoration and rectification work was the ideological transformation of teachers and students. Due to the Kuomintang's long-term control, destruction, and poisoning of youth's thinking, most teachers and students had deep-rooted so-called "orthodox" ideas and blindly believed in the United States. After the first stage of learning, they had a preliminary understanding of the People's Government, and the "orthodox" concept and illusions about American imperialism began to waver. In the second stage, they further realized what is revolution and counter-revolution, the relationship between various classes, clarified the path that intellectuals should take, and initially established a worldview of serving the people. This spring, in the work of supporting the army and the front, 400 teachers and students from the city went south with the army, and some participated in various social activities. Due to the People's Government's correct implementation of the policy of striving for unity among intellectuals, teachers and students who had been coerced to Jiangnan by the Kuomintang reactionaries returned to Bian one after another in May, and Henan University also returned. They accused the Jiang bandits of various crimes of deception against them, which greatly changed the thinking of the vast number of intellectuals in Bian. The Nanjing massacre on April 12 this year completely awakened the few teachers and students who still had illusions about the Jiang bandits. This summer, 800 students formed club organizations to help the People's Municipal Government with housing registration, held several get-togethers with railway workers and Pulim Electric Company employees, and cooperated with Henan's work of suppressing bandits and opposing local bullies, forming groups to go deep into the rural areas on the outskirts of the city to conduct extensive propaganda. During this period, most teachers and students have realized the truth that labor creates the world and further established the concept of labor.

The Kaifeng Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has held four terms of employee schools, and more than 1,300 workers have received education. Some of them have become trade union cadres, and some have become production models in various factories. The municipal workers', youth, and women's organizations also have 75 literacy schools, with 3,667 workers, shop assistants, old artists, and working women participating in the study. The People's Education Center has two branches and eight reading rooms, and a street broadcasting station has been established, and blackboards are spread throughout the main streets of the city. After the establishment of the Kaifeng Literary Federation in September, the new cultural movement serving the people will be carried out in a more planned and organized manner.

　　开封一年文教工作
    开封的文教工作，经过一年的整顿改造，已奠定了今后新民主主义教育发展的基础。
    开封是河南的文化心脏，去年十一月解放之初，连同河南其他城市集中在开封的大、中、小学校共达一百余所，学生两万余，当时人民政府本“维持现状，进行必要的与可能的改革”的方针，接管公立学校，登记审查私立学校，并大力恢复。首先对各校员生作了临时救济，组织复课，并分别举办教师与学生的讲座会，讲解人民政府城市政策及对知识分子的态度，接着成立了市学联筹委会，成为全市学生的核心组织。计当时恢复了中、小学校八十五座，动员了十四座各地来汴的中学迁回原地。对办得较好的私立中学校给予必要的扶助。这些措施，连同图书馆、博物馆、民教馆的接收，初步安定了当时文教界的混乱状态。
    去年寒假，文教局集训了全市七百名中小学教师，学联筹委会也举办了学生讲习会，进行了政治时事学习。积极培养一批政治进步和纯洁的教师，并在各校建立起民主管理制度。
    今年暑假，省市又联合举办了暑期教师讲习会，参加学习的有中小学校长、教务主任百余人。学习了毛主席的“论人民民主专政”及新民主主义教育方针，效果良好。截至目前为止，全市已有大学一座，学生三千余名，中等学校十五座，学生六千三百九十名，小学校七十三座，学生二千七百七十五名。
    与恢复、整顿工作同时，是对师生的思想改造。由于过去国民党长期对青年思想的控制摧残和毒害，一般员生有着根深蒂固的所谓“正统”观念以及盲目迷信美国。经过了第一阶段的学习，对人民政府有了初步的认识，“正统”观念与对美帝幻想开始动摇。第二阶段更深一步认识到什么是革命和反革命，各阶级的关系，明确了知识分子应走的道路，初步建立了为人民服务的人生观。今春拥军支前工作，全市四百名员生随军南下，一部分则参加了各种社会活动。由于人民政府正确执行了对知识分子的争取团结的政策，曾被国民党反动派胁迫至江南的员生在五月间即陆续返汴，河南大学也复员归来。他们控诉了蒋匪帮对他们诱骗的种种罪恶，使汴市广大知识分子的思想起了很大的变化。今年四月十二日的南京惨案，使少数对蒋匪仍抱有幻想的师生，也彻底觉悟过来了。今年暑期八百名学生成立了俱乐部的组织，帮助人民市政府举办房屋登记，先后与铁路工人、普临电灯公司职工举行数次联欢，并配合河南剿匪反恶霸工作，分组深入市郊农村作了广泛的宣传。这期间一般员生已认识到劳动创造世界的真理，进一步树立起劳动观念。
    中共开封市委举办了四期职工学校，一千三百余名工人受到教育，他们有的成了工会的干部，有的则成为各工厂的生产模范。市工、青、妇团体亦设有七十五座补习学校，工人、店员、旧艺人及劳动妇女三千六百六十七名参加学习。人民教育馆有两所分馆和八处阅览室，并设立了街头广播台，黑板报则遍及全市主要街道。经过改造的旧剧及新型歌剧已较普遍的在全市各剧院上演。九月汴市文联组织成立后，将更有计划有组织地开展为人民服务的新文化运动。
