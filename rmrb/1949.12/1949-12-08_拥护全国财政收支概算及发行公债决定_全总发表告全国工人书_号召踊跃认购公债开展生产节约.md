[Beijing News] In support of the Central People's Government's decision to approve the 1950 national budget of revenue and expenditure and to issue People's Victory Indexed Bonds, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a letter to workers nationwide on the 5th. The full text is as follows:

Fellow Workers Nationwide!

The meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2nd approved the 1950 budget of revenue and expenditure and the measures for issuing People's Victory Indexed Bonds. This is a wise decision by the Central People's Government, leading the people of the whole country to overcome the financial difficulties of 1950 and improve the national financial situation, stabilize prices, and create favorable conditions for economic construction.

Our working class deeply understands that the current financial and economic difficulties of our country are a temporary and inevitable phenomenon in the process of unprecedented national victory. Chairman Mao told us at the meeting of the Central People's Government Committee: "We have difficulties, we have solutions, and we have hope." As long as we overcome the difficulties of 1950, it will be possible to strive for a balance of revenue and expenditure and long-term stability of currency values and prices. Price stability is a favorable condition for developing production; continued development of production can make it easier for unemployed workers to return to work, and the lives of employed workers will be guaranteed. For example, the recent price fluctuations have primarily affected and caused difficulties for our wage-earning working class. Therefore, the Central People's Government's decision to issue People's Victory Indexed Bonds to reduce floating capital and stabilize prices is beneficial to the people of the whole country, especially to our working class.

Therefore, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions hereby calls on you: Unite as one to resolutely support the Central People's Government's decision to issue People's Victory Indexed Bonds, on the one hand, enthusiastically subscribe yourselves, and on the other hand, actively promote it, so that everyone does their best to purchase People's Victory Bonds, unite the people of the whole country to work together, guarantee the realization of the Central People's Government's 1950 budget of revenue and expenditure, and guarantee the completion of the issuance plan for People's Victory Indexed Bonds!

Fellow Workers Nationwide! To ensure the realization of the 1950 budget of revenue and expenditure, we workers have a greater responsibility, which is to further develop the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class on the front lines of restoring production and transportation, and to launch a broad, in-depth, and sustained production and thrift campaign to increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, and increase national fiscal revenue.

Fellow workers and all laboring brothers and sisters! Use your practical actions to wholeheartedly support the call of the Central People's Government and fight to overcome financial difficulties and strive for price stability!

　　拥护全国财政收支概算及发行公债决定
  　全总发表告全国工人书
    号召踊跃认购公债开展生产节约
    【北京讯】中华全国总工会为拥护中央人民政府通过的一九五零年全国财政收支概算及发行人民胜利折实公债的决定，特于五日发表告全国工人书。全文如下：全国男女工人们！
    十二月二日中央人民政府委员会的会议，通过了一九五零年度财政收支概算和发行人民胜利折实公债的办法。这是中央人民政府领导全国人民为克服一九五零年度财政困难与改善国家财政状况，稳定物价，以造成经济建设有利条件的英明决议。
    我们工人阶级深切的知道：目前我们国家财政经济的困难，是在全国空前胜利过程中的一种暂时的不可避免的现象。毛主席在中央人民政府委员会的会议中告诉我们：“我们是有困难的，有办法的，有希望的。”只要我们渡过一九五零年的困难，就有可能争取以后财政收支的平衡和币值物价的长期稳定。物价稳定，便是发展生产的有利条件，生产继续发展就可以使失业工人容易复业，在业工人的生活得到保障。譬如最近物价波动，首先受到影响和困难的便是我们工薪劳动阶级。所以中央人民政府决定发行人民胜利折实公债，以减少游资，稳定物价，是对全国人民有利的，特别是对我们工人阶级有利的。
    因此，中华全国总工会特向你们号召：大家一致起来，坚决拥护中央人民政府关于发行人民胜利折实公债的决定，一方面自己踊跃认购，另一方面积极宣传，使每个人都尽力购买人民胜利公债，团结全国人民共同努力，保证中央人民政府一九五零年度财政收支概算的实现，保证人民胜利折实公债发行计划的完成！
    全国男女工人们！为保证一九五零年度财政收支概算的实现，我们工人负有更重大的责任，这就要在恢复生产与交通事业的战线上，更加发挥工人阶级的积极性与创造性，开展广泛的深入的持久的生产节约运动，增加产量，提高质量，减低成本，增加国家的财政收入。
    全国男女工人和一切劳动者弟兄姊妹们！用你们的实际行动，来衷心地拥护中央人民政府的号召，为战胜财政困难，争取物价稳定而斗争呵！

    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九年十二月五日
