[Report from this newspaper] People in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles unanimously support the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds and believe that the public bond regulations are appropriate and reasonable. Fu Huating, director of the preparatory committee of the Industrial and Commercial Federation and manager of the only Weiyi Flour Mill, said: "The People's Victory Public Bonds issued by the People's Government are fundamentally different from the public bonds issued by the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past. The Kuomintang issued public bonds to plunder the people. After they swindled the people's money, their business was over. The public bond tickets rotted in the hands of the people and became waste paper. The People's Government issues public bonds to stabilize prices, stabilize people's livelihoods, and develop industry and commerce; the public bond regulations stipulate repayment in kind in installments with an annual interest rate of five percent. This is very reasonable. We firmly support it. The People's Government's spirit of seeking truth from facts has been fully demonstrated in the eleven months since the liberation of Beijing. The industrial and commercial circles of this city fully trust the government, and we must actively purchase [the bonds]."

The issuance of the People's Victory Public Bonds has a significant impact on stabilizing prices and developing industry and commerce. Liu Yifeng, manager of Henian Tang Chinese Medicine Shop, said: "Beijing's two price fluctuations have affected industry and commerce. Issuing public bonds can make up for the government's financial deficit and stabilize prices, which directly helps the development of industry and commerce. Therefore, we in the industrial and commercial circles very much welcome the government's issuance of public bonds, and we will do our best to purchase them." Speaking of this issue, Fu Huating cited the Northeast as an example: the Northeast issued public bonds, and this year prices have been very stable, which not only stabilized the lives of the people in the Northeast but also became a favorable condition for the development of industry and commerce in the Northeast.

Tang Shaoyuan, manager of Daxixi Wine Company, said: "The public bond regulations announced by the government this time are very reasonable and appropriate. The annual interest rate of five percent on public bonds is very appropriate." He also said, "The government stipulates that public bonds be repaid in kind, which is the best way." Liu Yifeng believes that the public bond regulations stipulate that the prices of rice, flour, cloth, and coal in six major cities, including Shanghai and Tianjin, be used to determine the "points," which is very correct. Because the prices in each city are unbalanced, since the public bonds are national in scope, the calculation of the "points" should also be based on the average price of important goods in major cities to be reasonable. The industrial and commercial households all believe that it is very reasonable that the public bond regulations stipulate that "public bonds shall not replace currency in circulation on the market, shall not be mortgaged to national banks, and shall not be used for speculation." Jiao Huanwu, manager of Ruifuxiang Silk Shop, said: "It must be stipulated that public bonds shall not be bought or sold, nor should exchanges be established; otherwise, speculators will have an opportunity to take advantage of it, disrupt prices, and undermine the development of industry and commerce." Fu Huating said: "Private transactions will also damage creditworthiness. If they are used to replace currency in circulation on the market, it is equivalent to disguised currency, which will further increase prices. Therefore, the regulations on public bonds are very correct."

All industrial and commercial households have unanimously expressed their enthusiasm for purchasing [the bonds]. Jiao Huanwu said: "We in the industrial and commercial circles must take the lead in purchasing these public bonds." All industrial and commercial households also hope that the city's residents can actively purchase [the bonds]. They all said: "Those with surplus funds should quickly buy public bonds. Buying public bonds will not only bring interest but also provide security." Sun Fuling, manager of Fuxing Flour Mill, said: "Those with idle funds should take them all out to buy public bonds, so that idle funds will no longer be rampant and disrupt prices." Jiao Huanwu said: "Every time prices fluctuate, it is because of idle funds. If everyone recognizes this and takes out idle funds to buy public bonds, prices will not rise sharply, people's lives will be stable, and everyone will be happy."

　　京工商界人士表示
  　决带头认购公债
    一致认为公债条例合理恰当，并希望有游资的人全部拿出来买公债。
    【本报讯】北京市工商界人士一致拥护人民胜利折实公债，并认为公债条例允当合理。工商联合会筹备委员会主任、唯一面粉经理傅华亭说：“人民政府发行的人民胜利公债和国民党反动政府过去发行的公债根本不同。国民党为了搜刮人民发行公债，骗取了老百姓的钱以后，他们的事情就完了。公债票烂在人民手里，变成了废纸。人民政府发行公债，是为了稳定物价、安定民生和发展工商业；公债条例上规定折实分期偿还，年息五厘。这是很合理的。我们坚决拥护。人民政府实事求是的精神，已在北京解放后的十一个月内完全表现出来，本市工商界对于政府完全信任，我们一定要踊跃购买。”
    人民胜利公债发行后，对于稳定物价、发展工商业有着重大作用。鹤年堂国药庄经理刘一峰说：“北京两次物价波动，工商业受了影响。发行公债可以弥补政府财政上的赤字，稳定物价，对于工商业的发展有直接的帮助，所以我们工商界人士是非常欢迎政府发行公债，我们要尽力购买。”谈到这个问题，傅华亭以东北为例说：东北发行了公债，今年物价就非常平稳，不仅使东北人民生活安定，而且更成为东北工商业发展的有利条件。
    大喜葡萄酒公司经理汤绍远说：“此次政府所公布的公债条例，是非常合理妥当的。公债年息五厘，很为确当。”他又说：“政府发行公债，规定按折实偿还，这个办法最好。”刘一峰认为公债条例上规定以上海、天津等六大城市的米面布煤的价格规定“分”，是很对的。因为各城市的物价不平衡，公债既为全国性，所以“分”的计算亦应按各主要城市的重要物品价格的平均数来订，才能合理。公债条例上规定“公债不得代替货币流通市面，不得向国家银行抵押，并不得用以作投机买卖”，各工商户都认为非常合理。瑞蚨祥绸缎庄经理焦寰五说：“必须规定公债不得买卖，也不要设立交易所；否则将使投机者有机可乘，扰乱物价，破坏工商业发展。”傅华亭说：“私人之间的买卖也会有损债信，若以之代替化币流通市面，则等于变相通货，更使物价上涨。所以公债条例上的规定是很对的。”
    各工商户都一致表示踊跃购买。焦寰五说：“我们工商界在这次公债的购买上，一定要带头做。”各工商户还希望本市住户亦能踊跃购买，他们都说：“有余款的人，应该赶快买公债，买了公债，既有利息，又有保障。”福兴面粉厂经理孙孚凌说：“有游资的应该全部拿出来买公债，这样将使游资不会再作崇，捣乱物价了。”焦寰五说：“每次物价波动，都因为游资作崇，如果大家认清了，把游资拿出来买公债，就不会使物价猛涨，就会使人民生活安定，大家高兴了。”
