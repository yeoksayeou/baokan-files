　　Support the New Household Registration System
    The Beijing Municipal People's Government has successively abolished many reactionary regulations and measures left over by the Kuomintang bandit gang, removing the people's heavy shackles and establishing a good revolutionary order, creating favorable conditions for the restoration and development of production, and winning the warm support of the people. The announcement this time to abolish the fifteen kinds of household registration forms and their complicated procedures left over by the Kuomintang bandit gang that wasted manpower and money, and to establish a new household registration system, is conducive to the consolidation of Beijing's revolutionary order and the development of economic, cultural and educational undertakings. The reason why Beijing did not immediately implement the reform of the household registration system before was because of insufficient preparation and immature conditions. Now, after several months of work, especially after the household registration check from June to August, the necessary conditions for establishing a new household registration order have been met. At the same time, the objective need for a new household registration system is also increasingly urgent. Municipal administration, grain administration, education, health, social relief, land reform, and the future implementation of universal suffrage all require accurate household registration statistics. For example, with accurate household registration statistics, it is possible to accurately open schools according to possibilities and needs, and to plan and build the city's tap water system. Therefore, the establishment of a new household registration order will bring huge political, economic, and cultural benefits to the city's two million people.
    The establishment of this new household registration order will more effectively prevent bandits and thieves, consolidate the security of the capital, prevent saboteurs from taking advantage of loopholes, and enable the city's people to engage in various undertakings with peace of mind to build their own lives.
    Precisely because the new household registration order is an important measure for the city's people to promote benefits and eliminate disadvantages, after the announcement of the Municipal People's Government was issued, once the publicity work was launched, it immediately won the warm support of the vast majority of the city's people. Believing that this is a measure that benefits the people, they all expressed that they want to "be an upright citizen, not a black person with a black household," so they have requested to correct the household registrations that were falsely reported or underreported in the past in order to resist the Kuomintang bandit gang's conscription and taxation, or to apply for registration. According to the statistics of one section of the 13th Police Station of the Outer Fourth Branch Bureau alone, 27 households have made such requests. Some activists among the masses have kindly suggested to the government and provided methods to avoid saboteurs taking advantage of loopholes and making trouble. These facts fully demonstrate that the measures of the People's Government are fully in line with the wishes of the two million people.
    Now, the establishment of a new household registration order has begun. We hope that all citizens will act together to assist the government, expose the rumors and sabotage of saboteurs, and earnestly establish a new household registration system in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal People's Government. In this work, expose illegal bad people, educate and transform a few backward elements, and work together to build a new Beijing.

　　拥护新的户口制度
    北京市人民政府对国民党匪帮遗留的许多反动规章、办法，相继废除，解除了人民的重重束缚，建立起良好的革命秩序，为恢复发展生产创造了有利条件，获得了人民的热烈拥护。此次宣布废除国民党匪帮遗留下的劳民伤财的十五种户口表册及其繁复手续，建立新的户口制度，这是有利于北京市革命秩序的巩固和经济与文化教育事业的发展的。前此北京市所以没有立即实行户口制度的改革，乃是由于准备工作不足，条件尚不成熟。现在，经过几个月来的工作，特别是经过了六月至八月的户口查对，开始建立新的户口秩序的必要条件已经具备了。同时新的户口制度的客观需要也日益迫切了。举凡市政、粮政、教育、卫生、社会救济、土地改革以及将来实行普选等，无一不需要准确的户口统计。举例来说，有了准确的户口统计，才有可能确切地按照可能与需要开办学校，才能计划与建设全市的自来水。因此，新的户口秩序的建立，将以巨大的政治、经济、文化的利益，带给全市二百万人民。
    这一新的户口秩序的建立，将更有效地防匪防盗，巩固首都治安，使破坏分子无隙可乘，使全市人民安定地从事各种事业，以建设自己的生活。
    正因为新的户口秩序是为全市人民兴利除弊的重要措施，所以当市人民政府的布告颁发后，宣传工作一经展开，立即获得全市广大人民的热烈拥护。认为这是有利人民的措施，都表示要“作一个光明正大的公民，不作那黑人黑户”，于是纷纷要求将过去为了对抗国民党匪帮抽丁、征税而假报、漏报的户口更正过来，或是声请登记，仅据外四分局十三派出所一个段的统计，即已有二十七户提出这种要求。有些群众中的积极分子，则善意地向政府建议，提供办法，避免破坏分子钻空子和捣乱。这些事实，充分说明了人民政府的措施，是完全符合于二百万人民的意愿的。
    现在，新的户口秩序之建立，已经开始，我们希望全体市民一致行动起来，协助政府，揭发破坏分子的造谣破坏，切实按照市人民政府的规章，把新的户口制度建立起来，并在这一工作中，检举违法的坏人，教育与改造少数落后分子，为建设新的北京而共同努力。
