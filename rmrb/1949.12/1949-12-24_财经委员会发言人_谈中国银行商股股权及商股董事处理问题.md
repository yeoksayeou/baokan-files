Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23rd—Branches of the Bank of China within the country have been taken over by military control commissions dispatched by the People's Liberation Army in various locations and have gradually resumed business. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, the head office of the bank was moved to Beijing this month to facilitate leadership. There is still a lack of clarity regarding how to handle the bank's commercial shares and directors. A reporter interviewed a spokesperson for the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council with the following questions, and received the following answers:

(1) Question: Are the commercial shares of the Bank of China recognized?

Answer: The principles for handling commercial shares were clearly stated in the Eight Chapters of the People's Liberation Army's Covenant. After the liberation of Shanghai, the Shanghai Military Control Commission also made it clear, based on the spirit of the Eight Chapters of the Covenant, when it sent personnel to take over the head office of the Bank of China. This means taking over its official shares, confiscating the shares of war criminals among the commercial shares, and fully recognizing the commercial shares of those other than war criminals.

(2) Question: How many official and commercial directors did the bank originally have? Will the commercial directors continue in their positions, or will a shareholders' meeting need to be convened to re-elect them?

Answer: The bank originally had twenty-five directors and nine supervisors. Among them, the government appointed thirteen directors and five supervisors; the remaining twelve directors and four supervisors were elected by the commercial shareholders. The official directors and supervisors of the bank will be appointed separately. The commercial directors and supervisors, except for war criminals and those who continue to collaborate with the enemy, may continue to hold their positions if they are willing to serve the people and have concrete expressions of such willingness.

(3) Question: When is the board of directors of the bank planning to convene?

Answer: A meeting can be held once the commercial directors arrive in Beijing, the official directors are appointed, and the legal quorum is met.

(4) Question: What measures has the bank's head office taken regarding overseas branches?

Answer: After the takeover, the bank's head office has repeatedly telegraphed overseas branches and banks that have dealings with the bank, refusing to comply with the illegal orders of the fake head office and informing the bank's overseas personnel to strictly adhere to their posts and protect the bank's assets. We value our employees, and as long as they are determined to serve the people, we will definitely give them job opportunities. Those who establish meritorious service will be rewarded.

　　财经委员会发言人
    谈中国银行商股股权及商股董事处理问题
    【新华社北京二十三日电】中国银行国内分支行处均先后为人民解放军各地军管会派员接管，并陆续复业。中央人民政府成立后，该行总处为便于领导起见，已于本月中旬奉命迁京办公。关于该行商股股权和商股董事如何处理等问题，外间还不完全明了。记者特以下列问题走访政务院财政经济委员会发言人，承答复如下：（一）问：中国银行商股股权是否承认？
    答：关于商股处理原则，人民解放军约法八章中早经明白宣示；上海解放后，上海市军管会于派员接收中国银行总处时，亦已根据约法八章精神一再作过明白表示。即接收其官股，没收商股中之战犯股权，对战犯以外之商股股权一律承认。
    （二）问：该行原官商股董事各占若干名？其中商股董事是否继续，抑须召集股东大会重新选举？
    答：该行原设董事二十五名，监察人九名。其中政府指派董事十三名，监察人五名；其余董事十二名，监察人四名，由商股股东选任。该行官股董事及监察人须另行委派，其商股董事及监察人则除战犯及继续附敌作恶者外，凡愿为人民服务并有具体表示者，均得继续留任。
    （三）问：该行董事会拟何时召开？
    答：一俟商股董事到京，官股董事派定，并满法定人数后即可开会。
    （四）问：该行总处对海外行处有何措施？
    答：该行总处于接管后，已一再致电海外分支机构及与该行有来往之银行，拒绝伪总处乱命，并告该行海外同人，严守岗位，保护行产。我们对于从业人员是重视的，只要他们决心为人民服务，我们一定给他们工作机会，凡建立功劳的，当给予奖励。
