　　Stop Pretending to Understand
    Chen Guzi
    Beijing has been liberated for almost a year, and many people have made considerable progress through study and reform. However, a small number of old intellectuals who consider themselves "men of letters" still carry heavy baggage. Old ideas have become lead weights hindering their progress! "It is a shame for a Confucian scholar to be ignorant of anything!" So they pretend to know everything. In the old society, pretending to know something, no one dared to get to the bottom of it. But the new society is based on seeking truth from facts, so Chairman Mao said, "If you don't understand, you don't understand. There's no need to pretend to understand," and called on everyone to "start learning from scratch." However, the "men of letters" consider this a great humiliation! The essays of the Tongcheng School, the parallel prose with its ornate sentences, cannot stump me. I don't want to have to learn so earnestly the words of those who "pull carts and sell sauce," it would be ridiculous!
    A few days ago, I met such a "man of letters" who was boasting, "The current 'isms' and 'theories' are all in plain language, easy to understand at a glance!" A comrade next to him said, "May I ask you, what is productive force, and what are the means of production?" He curled his lip and said, "What's so difficult about that! Productive force is the power of production, and the means of production is skill." The comrade held back his laughter and said, "May I ask again, is the Soviet Union now a communist society?" He chuckled and said, "Of course, a country ruled by the Communist Party is a communist society!" The comrade said, "I hope you will use both eyes to look at the current plain language, it's really not easy to 'understand at a glance'!"

　　甭装懂
    陈谷子
    北京解放快一年了，很多的人由于学习、改造都有了相当进步，惟有一般以“名士”自居的少数旧知识分子，到现在还背着很重的包袱。旧的思想成了他们进步的累赘的铅块！“一事不知，儒者之耻！”于是他们便无所不知。在旧社会中，假装说知道了，没有人敢刨根儿；新社会是实事求是的，所以毛主席说：“不懂就是不懂，不用假装懂，”并号召大家“从头学起”。然而“名士”认为这是奇耻大辱！桐城派的文章，骈四俪六的句子，都难不住我，不想现在“引车卖浆”者的话，也要那样认真学，未免笑话！
    前几天碰见这样一位“名士”，正夸说：“现在的什么主义，什么论，全是白话文，拿起来一目了然”！旁边有位同志说：“请教你，什么叫生产力，哪叫生产手段？”他把嘴一撇说：“这有什么呢！生产力就是生产力量，生产手段就是手艺。”那位同志忍着笑说：“再请教，苏联现在是不是共产社会？”他噗嗤一笑说：“共产党当政的国家，当然是共产社会！”那位同志说：“我希望你还是用两眼看看现在的白话文吧，‘一目’实在不容易‘了然’！”。
