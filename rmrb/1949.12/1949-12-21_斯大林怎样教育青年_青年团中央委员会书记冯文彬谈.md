How Stalin Educated Youth
    Jin Feng
    An Interview with Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League

　　Today, Chinese youth and youth all over the world are warmly celebrating Comrade Stalin's seventieth birthday. This is because Comrade Stalin is a staunch defender of lasting world peace, and a protector of the world's youth in their struggle for a better future; this is because Comrade Stalin, in theory and practice, guided and helped the Chinese revolution to achieve success, thus also liberating Chinese youth and opening the door to a happy life for them; this is because our dear Comrade Stalin, as early as 1926, made a correct assessment of the Chinese youth movement and brilliantly pointed out its direction and tasks, which the Chinese youth have followed ever since, playing their role in the Chinese revolutionary movement and thus liberating themselves; at the same time, it is even more because Comrade Stalin has so successfully guided tens of millions of young people in the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries in creating their own path to happiness, so that Chinese youth can continue to draw on their valuable experiences and achievements to educate themselves and move forward continuously.

　　Twenty-three years ago, when the current generation of Chinese youth, around the age of twenty, had not yet been born, when China was still deeply mired in the bitter sea of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, when the Chinese people were still oppressed and unable to breathe, and when the previous generation of today's youth had already risen up, Comrade Stalin, far away in Moscow, pointed out the role and strength of the Chinese youth movement, saying: "The youth movement in China is now of paramount importance. Student youth (revolutionary students), young workers, and young peasants—all these forces can drive the Chinese revolution forward." Why is this so? Comrade Stalin made such a profound analysis: "We should know that nowhere is the oppression suffered from imperialism so deep and urgent, nor is the feeling of needing to fight this oppression so sharp and painful as it is among the youth of China." This defined the direction and task of the Chinese youth movement—to oppose imperialist oppression and strive for national independence and democracy.

　　Over the years, the Chinese youth movement has been advancing along the path predicted by Comrade Stalin.

　　Now, because Chinese youth and the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao, have correctly embodied and brought into play Comrade Stalin's guiding ideology for the Chinese revolution and the Chinese youth movement, the Chinese revolution has achieved victory, and Chinese youth have personally tasted the fruits of victory. "Strive to build a new China" is the current slogan for Chinese youth to move forward. Thus, Comrade Stalin's leadership and education of Soviet youth during the construction period has become an indispensable guide and direction for Chinese youth to continue to advance today.

　　To learn science, to learn to master technology, to build a backward agricultural country into an industrial country, to build a socialist society and a communist society—this is the task that Comrade Stalin put forward to Soviet youth during the construction period. At the Eighth Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, he said: "We are faced with a fortress, this fortress is called science, and its vast departments of knowledge, we must occupy this fortress at any cost. If young people want to become builders of a new life, if they truly want to replace the old vanguard, they must occupy this fortress. … Today's task is to master science, to train new cadres of Bolshevik specialists in all departments of knowledge, to study, study, and study with the most persistent attitude. What we need now, comrades, is to make revolutionary youth study science." These words are entirely applicable to China today. The Chinese revolution has been victorious, but the Chinese economy, which has been cruelly destroyed for more than a hundred years by imperialism, feudalism, and Kuomintang rule, is in an extremely backward state. We need to create material happiness, to create a civilized and prosperous life for the people. In this way, we need to build, according to the latest scientific methods, to revive and build our industry and agriculture under the current economic conditions of backward China. This requires talents who master modern science and technology. There are not many such talents in China now. This is exactly as Comrade Stalin said. Now the Chinese people and Chinese youth are also encountering such a fortress called science. We must also occupy this fortress at any cost. And Chinese youth, if they want to become builders of a new life, must first occupy this fortress—study science with the most persistent attitude.

　　For student youth, Comrade Stalin long ago incisively pointed out the path of combining with the worker-peasant masses and consciously fulfilling their tasks in construction. In his letter to the First All-Union Congress of Proletarian Students, he pointed out that students can and should become new leading cadres in construction. And "the reason why the new leading cadres can build a new economy and a new culture, and the reason why they can be called new, is because they must completely and forever break with the old ways of leading. They should not be detached from the masses, but should be closely linked with the masses. They should not regard themselves as standing above the masses, but should stand in front of the masses, so that the masses surround them. Do not leave the masses, but approach them and win their trust and support. This is the new way of leading for the new leading cadres." At the same time, Comrade Stalin pointed out: "The difference between cadres engaged in construction under capitalism and those under socialism is that they are detached from workers and peasants, and they regard themselves as figures above the working masses. They do not value the trust of the masses, nor do they value their support, so they neither get trust nor get support." Comrade Stalin finally said decisively: "This road is completely impassable in our country." Chinese student youth should firmly and practically remember such beneficial lessons, and must make the current study advance along such a path—the close combination of studying science and studying politics. Only in this way is it possible to transform oneself into a member of the working masses and become a new leading cadre as Comrade Stalin said. Otherwise, other roads will be completely impassable.

　　Consolidating and developing the youth's own combat organization—the Leninist Young Communist League, tirelessly caring for, watching over, and guiding its progress—this is an important aspect of Comrade Stalin's implementation and inheritance of Comrade Lenin's legacy, and it is also one side of his great educational role for the world's youth and Chinese youth. At the Seventh Congress of the Young Communist League, he clearly stipulated the path for Young Communist League members: "Hold high Lenin's banner of internationalism, fight for friendship between all nations, strengthen our country's defense against capitalist attacks, smash the old world of enslavement and exploitation, build and strengthen the new world of free workers and communism, and in all your work, learn to link revolutionary enthusiasm with the firm and serious spirit of Bolshevik builders, and be outstanding sons and daughters of your mother—the Federal Communist Party." Among these, Comrade Stalin's education of Soviet youth in the spirit of internationalism is particularly worthy of the earnest and tireless efforts of Chinese youth who have won the revolution. Comrade Stalin said to the Young Communist League members: "Internationalism is the basic idea in the work of the Young Communist League. This is its strength. The spirit of internationalism must constantly cover the entire Young Communist League, and the successes and failures of our proletarian struggle at home must be linked with the successes and failures of the international revolutionary movement in the consciousness of the Young Communist League members. Every Young Communist League member must not regard our revolution as his own goal, but as a tool and assistant for achieving the victory of the world proletarian revolution." Under the education of such a vast and magnificent revolutionary spirit, the Soviet Young Communist League members and the people naturally care about the fate of the Chinese people as much as they care about the fate of their own country. It is no wonder that they hang maps of China in classrooms and cheer for every advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; it is also no wonder that the Soviet Red Army sheds its blood on the lands of Romania and Hungary, and on the lands of Korea and Northeast China. Unconditionally helping the people of all countries is because the Soviet youth regard the liberation of the people of the world as the ultimate goal of their work, because the Soviet youth regard the victory of their domestic revolution merely as a tool and assistant for achieving the victory of the world proletarian revolution. In this way, some Chinese youth who still harbor narrow nationalistic ideas, under the shining light of this great spirit of internationalism, should be enlightened and educated, and will further learn from Soviet youth to clarify their responsibilities and beliefs: When the Chinese revolution is victorious, regard the revolutionary cause of the world as their own cause, and regard the liberation of the people of other unliberated countries as their own responsibility.

　　斯大林怎样教育青年
    金凤
    青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬谈
    今天，中国青年和全世界青年一起热烈地庆贺斯大林同志的七十寿辰。这是因为斯大林同志是世界持久和平的巩固的保卫者，是世界青年为争取未来更美好生活而斗争的保护者；这是因为斯大林同志在理论上和实际上指导和帮助了中国的革命，使它获得成功，因而也使中国青年获得解放，打开了他们的通向幸福生活的大门；这是因为我们的亲爱的斯大林同志早在一九二六年对于中国青年运动就作出了正确的估价并天才地指出了它的方向和任务，中国青年此后遵循着这个方向，在中国的革命运动中发挥了自己的作用并从而解放了自己；同时，更因为斯大林同志已如此胜利地引导了苏联及其他人民民主国家数千万的青年创造了自己幸福的道路，因此中国青年也有可能继续不断地汲取他们宝贵的经验和成果来教育自己，不断前进。
    二十三年以前，中国现在这一代二十岁左右的青年还没有出世的时候，中国还深深沉沦在半殖民地半封建社会的苦海的时候，中国人民还被压迫得喘不过气来，现在的青年的前一辈已有一部分奋身而起的时候，远在莫斯科的斯大林同志，就指出了中国青年运动的作用和力量，他说：“在中国青年运动，现在是有头等重大的意义，学生青年（革命的学生），青年工人，青年农民，——一切这些力量能够推动中国革命向前进展”，为什么会是这样呢，斯大林同志作了这样的深刻的分析：“我们应当知道，没有那个遭受帝国主义的压迫，是如此的深刻和迫切，也没有那一感觉需要与这压迫作斗争，是如此的尖锐沉痛如象中国的青年一样。”这就规定了中国青年运动的方向与任务——反对帝国主义的压迫，争取民族的独立和民主。
    这些年来，中国的青年运动是沿着斯大林同志所预示的道路前进的。
    现在，由于中国青年和中国人民在中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛主席的领导下，正确地体现了和发挥了斯大林同志对于中国革命和中国青年运动的指导思想，中国革命获得了胜利，中国青年已亲身尝到了胜利的果实，“为建设新中国而努力”，是当前中国青年前进中的口号，这样，斯大林同志对于建设期中苏联青年的领导和教育就成为今日中国青年所不可缺少的继续前进的指针和方向了。
    学习科学，学习掌握技术，把落后的农业国建设为工业国，建设社会主义社会和共产主义社会，这就是斯大林同志在建设期中对于苏联青年提出的任务。在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第八次代表大会上，他说：“我们在面前遇到一座堡垒，这座堡垒叫做科学，以及它广大的各部门的知识，我们不管付任何代价，必须占领这座堡垒。假使青年们希望成为新生活的建设者，假使他们真正希望代替旧的前卫，他们便必须占领这座堡垒。……今天的任务便是去掌握科学，去锻炼出各部门知识中布尔什维克专门家的新干部，去学习，学习，以最坚持的态度去学习，同志们，现在我们所需要的，就是使革命青年去学习科学。”这些话完全适用于现在的中国。中国的革命是胜利了，但是被帝国主义、封建主义与国民党统治所残酷破坏了一百多年的中国经济，是处在异常落后的状态之中。我们需要创造物质的幸福，创造人民的文明、富足的生活，这样，我们就需要建设，按照最新的科学方法，在落后的中国现在的经济条件下，复兴和建设我们的工业和农业，这就需要掌握现代科学和技术的人才，这样的人才中国现在还不多，这就正如斯大林同志所说的，现在中国人民和中国青年面前也正是遇到了这样的一座叫做科学的堡垒，我们也是要不管付任何代价，必须占领这座堡垒，而中国青年们，要希望成为新生活的建设者，首先也是必须要占领这座堡垒——以最坚持的态度去学习科学。
    对于学生青年，斯大林同志早就警辟地指出了要与工农群众相结合的道路，要出于心愿的去自觉的完成自己在建设中的任务。他在给第一次全苏联无产阶级学生代表大会的信上指出学生们是可以而且应当成为建设中的新的领导干部的。而“新的领导干部之所以能建设新的经济和新的文化，以及他之所以能称为新的，就是因为他必需与旧的领导道路干脆的永远断绝。他们不应当脱离群众，而应当亲密的与群众联系，他们不应当把自己看成站在群众之上的，而应当站在群众前面，使群众围绕在自己的周围。不要离开群众，而要接近他们和博得群众对自己底信任和赞助，这就是新的领导干部底新的领导道路”。在同时，斯大林同志指出：“在资本主义之下从事建设的干部所不同的地方就是他们是与工人和农民脱离的，他们把自己看成超乎劳动群众之上的人物。他们既不重视群众方面底信任，亦不重视他们底赞助，所以他们就既得不到信任亦得不到赞助”。斯大林同志最后斩钉截铁地这样说：“这种道路在我们国内是完全不通的”。中国的学生青年应当牢牢地切实记取这样有益的教训，必须使现在的学习沿着这样一条道路前进——学习科学和学习政治紧密结合起来，这样才有可能改造自己成为劳动群众的一员，并能做一个斯大林同志所说的新的领导干部，否则，别的道路是会完全走不通的。
    巩固和发展青年自己的战斗组织—列宁共产主义青年团，不倦地关心着注视着指导着她前进，这是斯大林同志执行并继承列宁同志遗训的一个重要方面，也是他对于世界青年和中国青年所起的伟大教育作用的一面。在少共第七次代表大会中，他这样明确地规定着青年团员的道路：“把列宁的国际主义的旗帜高举起来，为各民族间的友爱而战斗，加强我们国家的防卫以及对资本主义的进攻，粉碎那奴役与剥削的旧世界，建设而且加强自由的劳动者与共产主义的新世界，在你们各部工作中间，学习把革命热情和布尔塞维克建设者的坚定的认真精神联结起来，要做你的母亲—联邦共产党的优秀儿女”。在这之中，斯大林对于苏联青年的国际主义精神的教育，是特别值得革命胜利了的中国青年所认真不倦地努力学习的。斯大林同志对青年团员这样说：“国际主义是青年团工作中的基本思想。
    这就是它的力量。必须使国际主义的精神时刻不断地覆盖着青年团的全部，必须要在青年团员的意识中把我们国内的无产阶级斗争中底成功和失败与国际革命运动底成功和失败联系起来。必须要使每个青年团员不把我们的革命当作自己的目标，而把它当作达到世界无产阶级革命胜利的工具和助手”。在这样浩瀚雄伟的革命气魄教育下的苏联青年团员及人民，他们系关心自己祖国的命运一样关心中国人民的命运，在教室内悬挂着中国的地图，为中国人民解放军的每次前进而欢跳，自然不是奇怪的事了；苏联的红军把自己的鲜血洒在罗马尼亚和匈牙利的土地上，洒在朝鲜和中国东北的土地上，自然也不是奇怪的事了。无条件地帮助各国人民，因为苏联的青年是把全世界人民的解放看作他们工作的最终目标，因为苏联的青年把自己国内革命的胜利仅仅当作达到世界无产阶级革命胜利的工具和助手。这样，中国的有些还怀着狭隘的民族主义思想的青年，在这伟大的国际主义精神光辉的照耀下，应该得到启发和教育，而且会更进一步学习苏联青年明确自己的责任和信念：在中国革命胜利的时候，把全世界革命事业当做自己的事业，把解放其他尚未解放国家的人民，当做自己的责任。
