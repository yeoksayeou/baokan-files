    [This newspaper reports] To coordinate with stabilizing prices, Wuhan City's advance collection of fourth-quarter income tax and business tax has been completed as scheduled. The Wuhan Municipal People's Government and relevant authorities, initially to promptly stabilize prices and with the unanimous approval of the business community, decided to advance the collection of this year's fourth-quarter income tax and business tax. It was decided that from the 4th to the 6th of this month, 60 percent would be completed within three days, and all would be paid into the treasury by the 10th. Due to the enthusiastic support of the business community and the active promotion of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, various merchants enthusiastically paid their taxes. As of the 10th, except for a very small number of merchants who were unable to pay on schedule for special reasons and were granted a grace period by the tax bureau, over 13.7 billion yuan in tax revenue has been collected, accounting for more than 97 percent of the total tax revenue. Therefore, this blitz tax collection task, which was charged with stabilizing prices, has been victoriously completed as scheduled.
