As for the United States, its industrial production is currently declining continuously. Naturally, the situation is the same in the so-called Marshallized countries, which U.S. monopoly capital wants to burden with the consequences of economic panic. Unemployment is increasing, and the living standards of workers and their families continue to decline. The financial burden of colonial wars and the preparations for a third world war have increased the poverty of the masses of the people, while trusts have made fortunes.

In order to preserve their vast privileges and continue to make fortunes, and in order to strengthen their already shaky rule against the people, or to regain rule in places where they have lost it, the imperialists are accelerating war preparations.

The imperialists are engaged in a frantic arms race. They are placing the burden of increasingly astronomical military budgets on the people. They are establishing aggressive bases all over the world, and they are forming new, aggressive military blocs. While expanding the military institutions of the Atlantic Pact, they also want to complete this institution in the Pacific. They wanted to establish a good main military base in the Pacific in China, although they had openly spent a lot of dollars on their running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries. But they have now been defeated in China.

In Vietnam, Malaya, Burma, and Indonesia, because they cannot force the people of various countries to act as puppets, as the traitor Nehru played the role, the U.S. imperialists directly supply the lackey governments of Britain, France, and the Netherlands with arms and military staff. But neither armed intervention nor suppression can stop the people who are fighting for freedom from advancing.

The movement to defend peace has been organized, expanded, and strengthened all over the world. This spring, the World Peace Congress was held in Paris and Prague; the Women's International Democratic Federation also actively participated in this meeting. This can be said to be the first grand event in history. Representatives from seventy-two countries, representing six hundred million men and women, declared that they would resolutely fight against the imperialist warmongers from now on, and that they would establish a real and lasting peace all over the world based on the principle of respecting the national independence of all countries, large and small.

Subsequently, peace congresses were held in seventeen countries. National committees for the defense of peace have now been established in forty-six countries. This movement is developing every day.

Not long ago, the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation, which was held in Moscow, confirmed how enthusiastically women from all countries responded to the declaration issued by the Second Congress of the International Federation held in Budapest a year ago. No matter where they are, they bravely and enthusiastically devote themselves to the struggle for peace and national independence. Not only are more and more women understanding that unity and action are necessary, but their struggle has also been strengthened due to political awareness.

Millions of Chinese women have fought alongside men to liberate the whole country from imperialist control, and they are still fighting. They participate in the land reform movement; they fight for the development of culture and the elimination of illiteracy; they, together with the government and the people, are building their country into the most advanced fortress of peace forces in Asia, smashing the imperialists' attempts to launch a new war.

Women in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya are fighting against imperialist warmongers and colonialists together with their people. Two million Vietnamese women have joined the Vietnamese Women's Federation to strengthen their combat capabilities.

In Japan, the movement against U.S. imperialism is gradually expanding. Japanese women prepared to participate in our conference with unparalleled enthusiasm. They widely publicized the convening of our conference among the Japanese women masses. However, the U.S. occupation authorities, fearing that they would unite with democratic forces in other places, did not allow them to leave Japan.

In India and Iran, regardless of the brutal oppression of democratic forces by the imperialist running dogs, women are forever participating in the struggle for national independence in increasing numbers. In Syria and Lebanon, this movement has also been greatly strengthened.

Greek women also participated in the heroic battle of the Greek people.

The same is true in France and Italy, where tens of millions of women have long been awakened from political life and are launching an active struggle to defend peace and oppose the imperialist warmongers and their running dog domestic governments. Women in imperialist countries have also begun to understand that a nation that oppresses another nation will not be free itself, and that the struggle for the independence of colonial nations is also their own struggle, because it is part of the common struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism.

Women in Latin America, in Cuba, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, have taken active steps to combat U.S. imperialism, which wants to turn their countries into semi-colonies.

British and American women have begun to point out the facts of the danger of war and have shown an increasingly strong action to fight for peace.

Even in fascist dictatorial countries like Spain, the struggle is developing in terror, and the recent arrest of a group of peasant women and their sentencing for assisting guerrillas is good evidence.

In Germany, hundreds of thousands of women organized under the German Women's Federation support the government of the German Democratic Republic and actively fight for the unity of their country, for the eradication of fascism, and for the formation of a force for peace.

In the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Albania, and Bulgaria, millions of women actively support their governments' peace policies.

Soviet women, as early as before the war, had fully supported and supported their government, fighting to unite all forces for peace and to eliminate war. Soviet women contributed their strength, their wisdom, their talents, and even their lives by the thousands and tens of thousands, along with their millions of men, to defeat Hitler's Germany and Japanese imperialism. Soviet women stand firmly at the forefront of all peace-loving women in the world.

Their experience and heroism in the struggle for peace, just as in the patriotic war in socialist countries in the past, ignite the hearts of women all over the world, of mothers all over the world, and inspire their strength. Because they all yearn to spare their children, their families, and their countries from the horrors of imperialist war.

We can see clearly that the world's peace camp is expanding day by day, and it is a matter of pride for us that the 59 national women's federation organizations of the Women's International Democratic Federation are also actively participating in this camp.

But we should not be intoxicated by this success, the danger still exists. Because the expansion of the people's movement and the increase in strength have further aroused the madness of the imperialist bandits, they have not abandoned their conspiracy plans to prepare for an anti-Soviet war.

Because of the continuous strengthening of the peace front, their constant barking and provocations will no longer be effective. Therefore, they used other means, sending the most vile and shameless slanders to the Soviet Union, hoping to deceive the people with this, trying to make them believe that it was the Soviet Union that was threatening peace, so as to divert their attention. But all the people clearly see the Soviet Union's peace policy and support the Soviet Union's peace policy.

Thus, the imperialists used even more insidious methods. They bought off Tito and the Yugoslav bandits, betraying the people of Yugoslavia or the entire democratic camp. They are driving organizations that conspire for war but pretend to be for peace. Therefore, we must be extra vigilant, oppose those traitors, and expose the chauvinistic ideas that enemy spies attempt to use to divide the peace camp. In order to effectively strike the warmongers and their running dogs, we should simultaneously expand and increasingly strengthen our ranks. This is the responsibility of the Women's International Democratic Federation established after the Second World War.

The Women's International Democratic Federation invites national democratic women's federations to join the ranks of the masses of the people to oppose the instigators of the Third World War and to oppose the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Pact. The Women's International Democratic Federation has led a vast army to oppose atomic weapons and other weapons of mass slaughter. This movement has received the support of women all over the world, and the tens of millions of signed letters sent to the United Nations are clear evidence of this. The Women's International Democratic Federation has directed women in imperialist countries to oppose colonial wars and armed intervention in Greece, and to support the struggle of Greek women for national independence. The International Federation led the resistance against the terrorist forces in Greece and Spain, and also opposed the arrests, torture, and all the atrocities against democrats in Argentina, Lebanon, and Iran, also condemned the massacre of women in India; and organized investigation teams to visit Spain, Southeast Asia and Algeria.

The Women's International Democratic Federation is also the initiator of this Asian Women's Conference. The mission of the Asian Women's Conference is to help Asian women solve all the major problems facing the Asian people and them, first of all their struggle for national independence. At the same time, the conference also includes the responsibility of women in imperialist countries to strengthen their struggle against imperialist governments, to demand an immediate end to colonial wars and armed intervention, and to provide solidarity and support to sisters in oppressed countries.

In the Women's International Democratic Federation, an organization that fights for their ideals, all women demand to defend democracy, national independence, and the rights of women and children. Therefore, at each meeting of the Council, new organizations have requested to join the Women's International Democratic Federation. The last Council approved the participation of the Japanese Democratic Women's Committee, the Israeli Shita Women's Federation, the Ecuadorian Women's Union, and the Bolivian Peace Women's Congress. Therefore, there are now 59 member countries participating in the Women's International Democratic Federation.

In order to properly fulfill the mission of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the Executive Committee adopted the following decisions at its last meeting:

--In order to continue to develop and expand the struggle for peace, the main task is to actively participate in the work of expanding the ranks of the masses of the people proposed by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress; to immediately stop the war of slaughter in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya; to immediately implement disarmament and ban the use of atomic weapons, and to conclude a peace treaty among the great powers.

--Actively participate in all international and local conferences and meetings to defend peace, such as participating in national or local peace organizations, and launching peace organizations in cities, towns, and all public and private organizations.

--Strive to promote the active participation of all working women in the struggle for peace. In order to achieve this goal, the special circumstances of the women's movement in various countries should be combined with the general democratic women's movement.

The Women's International Democratic Federation and its national organizations should especially assist Asian and African women in the correct struggle for national independence, should actively participate in this Asian Women's Representative Conference, should widely publicize the results of this conference, and should participate in the implementation of its resolutions.

The Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation requests the women's organizations of all countries to pay special attention to the fact that during the period of the expansion of the economic crisis in capitalist countries and the increasing hardship of workers' living standards due to capital plunder, it is necessary to more closely unite the struggle for peace and for workers' economic rights, and should actively support those who increase wages, reduce prices, improve working conditions and reduce military spending.

In order to ensure the solidarity of all peace-loving people, women's organizations in all countries should maintain close cooperation with all other democratic organizations, trade unions, youth groups, peace organizations, cultural circles, and scientific circles.

The Council approved the proposal to designate June 1 as International Children's Day.

The tasks placed before us are huge, and there are still many difficulties ahead. But we women and mothers are determined to contribute our strength and spare no sacrifice in order to guarantee our children a happy life in a peaceful world.

Due to our actions and our struggle in the anti-imperialist democratic camp, all nations in the world will become free nations one by one.

Long live the Soviet women who were the first to gain freedom!

Long live the liberation of the Chinese people and the liberation of Chinese women!

Long live the People's Republic of China and her leader Chairman Mao!

Long live the struggle of all Asian women for national independence!

Long live the International Anti-Imperialist League!

Long live the Women's International Democratic Federation!

　　国际民主妇联为民族独立与和平的斗争（续完）
    国际民主妇联总书记古久里夫人在亚洲妇女代表会议上的报告
    至于在美国，目前她的工业生产都正在不断地下跌。自然，在美国垄断资本想叫他们负担经济恐慌的后果的所谓马歇尔化国家中，情形也是一样。失业增加，工人和工人家属的生活水准继续下降。殖民地战争的财政上的负担，三次世界大战的准备，加重了人民大众的贫困，却使托拉斯发了财。
    为了保存他们庞大的特权，继续发财，为了加强他们业已动摇的反对人民的统治，或者在已失去统治的地方重新获得统治，帝国主义者正加速准备战争。
    帝国主义者进行了一种疯狂的军备竞争。他们把越来越近天文数字的军事预算的重担，压在人民身上。他们在全世界各地建立侵略基地，他们成立新的、具有侵略性的军事集团。他们一面扩展着大西洋公约中的军事机构，一面还想在太平洋方面来完成这机构。他们想在中国建立太平洋方面的优良的主要军事基地，虽然他们曾经公开地在他们的走狗国民党反动派身上化了大笔美元。但他们现在在中国方面是遭到失败了。
    在越南、马来亚、缅甸、印度尼西亚，因为他们无法强迫各国人民充当傀儡，一如尼赫鲁叛徒所充当的角色一样，美帝国主义者就直接把军火和军事参谋人员供给英、法、荷各国的奴才政府。但无论武装干涉也好，弹压也好，都不能阻止争取自由的人民前进。
    保卫和平运动在全世界已经组织起来、扩大起来而且加强起来了。今年春天，世界保卫和平大会在巴黎和布拉格两地举行了；国际民主妇联也积极参加了这一会议。这可以说是历史上第一次盛举。七十二个国家、六万万男女的代表们，宣布今后坚决地要对帝国主义的战争贩子作积极的斗争，要在尊重大小各国人民的民族独立的原则下，在全世界各地建立起真正而永久的和平。
    接着，在十七个国家中，都举行了保卫和平代表大会。现在已有四十六个国家成立了保卫和平的全国委员会。这一运动，每天都有新的开展。
    不久以前，在莫斯科召开的国际民主妇联理事会，证实了各国的妇女是多么热烈地响应了一年前布达佩斯举行的国际妇联第二次代表大会所发表的宣言。不论在任何地方，她们勇敢而热烈地投身于为和平与民族独立的斗争中去。不仅了解团结与行动是必要的妇女日渐众多，而且由于政治觉悟的原因，她们的斗争也加强了。
    为了从帝国主义的控制下整个地解放全国，中国数百万妇女曾经同男人们一道斗争过，而且还在斗争着。她们参加土地改革运动；他们为发展文化、扫除文盲而斗争；她们与政府和人民在一道，把她们的国家建设成为亚洲和平力量最前进的堡垒，粉碎了帝国主义进行新战争的企图。
    在越南、印度尼西亚、马来亚的妇女们，和他们的人民共同对帝国主义战争贩子、殖民者作战。二百万越南妇女为了加强她们的战斗能力，已经参加越南妇联组织。
    在日本，反对美帝国主义运动逐渐扩大。日本妇女曾以无比的热情预备参加我们的大会。她们曾经把我们大会的召开在日本妇女群众中广泛宣传。但是美占领军当局惧怕她们和其它各地民主力量联合，不允许她们离开日本。
    在印度，在伊朗，不管帝国主义走狗们对民主力量的野蛮压迫，妇女们永远以逐渐增多的数量参加民族独立斗争。在叙利亚，在黎巴嫩，这种运动也大大地增强起来。
    希腊妇女也参加了希腊人民英勇的战斗。
    在法国，在意大利也是一样，成千百万妇女早已从政治生活中觉悟起来，正展开保卫和平反对帝国主义战争贩子及其走狗本国政府的积极的斗争。帝国主义国家妇女也开始明了压迫另一个民族的民族自己不会是自由的，殖民地民族独立的斗争也就是她们自己的斗争，因为这是构成各国人民反帝国主义共同斗争中的一部分。
    拉丁美洲的妇女，在古巴，在阿根廷，在巴西，在乌拉圭，已向要把他们国家变成半殖民地的美帝国主义采取了积极斗争。
    英国妇女、美国妇女开始指出了战争危险事实，并表现了为和平斗争的日见强大的行动。
    就是象西班牙那样法西斯独裁国家，斗争也在恐怖中开展，新近有一批农妇被捕，并被判以协助游击队的罪名，那是个很好的证据。
    在德国，组织在德国妇联之下的成千成万妇女，拥护德意志民主共和国政府，为她们国家的统一，为根绝法西斯主义并组成和平力量，积极斗争。
    在捷克、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚，数百万妇女积极地支援她们政府的和平政策。
    苏联妇女，早在战前已经以全力支持拥护她们的政府，为了联合所有和平力量、免除战争而斗争。苏联妇女成千成万地贡献了她们的力量，她们的智慧，她们的才能，甚至她们的生命，和她们成千成万的男子们，去打倒希特勒德国和日本帝国主义。苏联妇女坚决地站在全世界所有和平妇女的前锋。
    她们在为和平的斗争中的经验和英勇，一如过去在社会主义国家爱国战争中一样，燃起全世界妇女、全世界母亲的心，并鼓舞了她们的力量。因为她们全都渴望为她们的孩子，为她们的家庭，为她们的国家，免除帝国主义战争的恐怖。
    我们看得清楚，全世界和平阵营日益扩大，国际民主妇联五十九个各国妇联组织也积极参加这个阵营，这是值得我们骄傲的事。
    但是我们不该为这个成功而陶醉，危险仍然是存在的。因为人民运动的扩大和力量的增强，更激起帝国主义匪徒的疯狂，他们还没有放弃他们准备反苏战争的阴谋计划。
    由于和平阵线不断的加强，他们不断狂吠与挑衅再不会有效。因此，他们使用了别的手段，向苏联发出最下流无耻的污蔑，他们希望以此欺骗老百姓，企图使他们相信是苏联在威胁和平，以便转移他们的视线。但是所有人民明显地看出苏联的和平政策，并且拥护苏联的和平政策。
    于是，帝国主义使用了更阴险的方法。他们收买了铁托和南斯拉夫的匪帮，背叛了南斯拉夫人民或整个民主阵营。他们驱使着阴谋战争而假冒和平的机构。因此，我们必须格外警惕，反对那些叛徒，暴露敌人间谍企图用来分化和平阵营的那些沙文主义思想。为了有效地给战争贩子及其走狗以打击，我们应该同时扩大并日益加强我们的队伍。这就是第二次世界大战结束后，国际民主妇联建立的责任。
    国际民主妇联邀请各国民主妇联会来加入人民群众队伍，反对第三次世界大战的煽动者，反对马歇尔计划和大西洋公约。国际民主妇联曾领导广大的队伍，反对原子武器和其他大量屠杀人民的武器。这一运动曾获得全世界各地妇女的支持，千千万万送到联合国组织的签名信就是明显的证据。国际民主妇联曾指挥帝国主义国家妇女反对殖民战争、反对希腊的武装干涉，并支持希腊妇女为民族独立的斗争。国际妇联领导反抗在希腊及西班牙的恐怖势力，并且反对在阿根廷、在黎巴嫩、在伊朗的对民主分子的逮捕、酷刑及所有的污行，也谴责了在印度的对妇女的屠杀；并且组织调查团访问西班牙、东南亚以及阿尔及利亚。
    国际民主妇联同时也是这次亚洲妇女会议的发起人，亚洲妇女大会的使命是协助亚洲妇女解决一切放在亚洲人民和她们面前的一切大问题，首先就是她们民族独立的斗争。同时，大会还包含了帝国主义国家妇女们的责任，加强她们对帝国主义政府的斗争责任，要求立刻停止殖民地战争武装干涉，并且对被压迫国家的姊妹们给予团结的支援。
    在国际民主妇联这一个为她们的理想而斗争的组织中，一切妇女都要求保卫民主、民族独立、妇女与儿童的权利。所以在每次的理事会开会时，新的组织纷纷要求参加国际民主妇联。最后一次理事会已批准日本民主妇女委员会、以色列史达妇女联合会、厄瓜多尔妇女联盟和波利维亚和平妇女大会参加。因此，今日参加国际民主妇联的会员国已有五十九个国家了。
    为了好好完成国际民主妇联的使命，执委会在最后一次会议上曾采取以下的决定：
    ——为了达到继续开展并扩大为和平的斗争，主要任务就是积极参加保卫世界和平大会常设委员会所建议的扩大人民群众队伍的工作；使越南、印度尼西亚、马来亚屠杀战争立刻停止；立即实行裁军，禁止使用原子武器以及缔结列强和平公约。
    ——积极参加国际间各国以及各地一切保卫和平的大会及会议，如参加各国或各地方保卫和平的组织，发动各城市村镇以及一切公私团体组织和平机构。
    ——努力促进所有工作妇女积极参加和平斗争。为了达到这个目的，应使各国妇女运动特殊情况和一般民主妇女运动结合起来。
    国际民主妇联及其各国组织应特别协助在民族独立正确的斗争中的亚洲及非洲妇女，应积极参加这一次亚洲妇女代表会议，应将这次大会结果广泛宣传，并参加它的决议的施行。
    国际民主妇联理事会请各国妇女组织特别注意在资本主义国家经济危机扩大和由于资本掠夺而形成工人生活水准日渐困苦的时期，应更密切联合为和平与为工人经济权利斗争的必要，应该积极支援那些增加工资、减低物价、改善工作条件及减缩军费各种要求。
    为保证所有爱好和平人士团结一致，各国妇女组织应该与其他一切民主组织、工会、青年团体、保卫和平组织、文化界、科学界保持密切合作。
    理事会赞成以六月一日为国际保卫儿童日的提议。
    放在我们面前的任务是很巨大的，还有很多困难在前面。但是，我们妇女、母亲下决心要供献出我们的力量，不惜任何牺牲，为了给我们的孩子保证一个在和平世界里的快乐的生活。
    由于我们的行动，由于我们在反帝国主义民主阵营中的斗争，全世界所有各民族将一一成为自由的民族。
    最早获得自由的妇女，苏联妇女万岁！
    中国人民解放和中国妇女解放万岁！
    中华人民共和国和她的领袖毛主席万岁！
    所有亚洲妇女为民族独立斗争万岁！
    国际反帝国主义联盟万岁！
    国际民主妇联万岁！
