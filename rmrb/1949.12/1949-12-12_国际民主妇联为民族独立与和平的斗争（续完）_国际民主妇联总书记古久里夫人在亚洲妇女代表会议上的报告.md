As for the United States, its industrial production is currently declining continuously. Naturally, the situation is the same in the so-called Marshallized countries, which U.S. monopoly capital wants to burden with the consequences of economic panic. Unemployment is increasing, and the living standards of workers and their families continue to decline. The financial burden of colonial wars and the preparations for a third world war have increased the poverty of the masses of the people, while trusts have made fortunes.

In order to preserve their vast privileges and continue to make fortunes, and in order to strengthen their already shaky rule against the people, or to regain rule in places where they have lost it, the imperialists are accelerating war preparations.

The imperialists are engaged in a frantic arms race. They are placing the burden of increasingly astronomical military budgets on the people. They are establishing aggressive bases all over the world, and they are forming new, aggressive military blocs. While expanding the military institutions of the Atlantic Pact, they also want to complete this institution in the Pacific. They wanted to establish a good main military base in the Pacific in China, although they had openly spent a lot of dollars on their running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries. But they have now been defeated in China.

In Vietnam, Malaya, Burma, and Indonesia, because they cannot force the people of various countries to act as puppets, as the traitor Nehru played the role, the U.S. imperialists directly supply the lackey governments of Britain, France, and the Netherlands with arms and military staff. But neither armed intervention nor suppression can stop the people who are fighting for freedom from advancing.

The movement to defend peace has been organized, expanded, and strengthened all over the world. This spring, the World Peace Congress was held in Paris and Prague; the Women's International Democratic Federation also actively participated in this meeting. This can be said to be the first grand event in history. Representatives from seventy-two countries, representing six hundred million men and women, declared that they would resolutely fight against the imperialist warmongers from now on, and that they would establish a real and lasting peace all over the world based on the principle of respecting the national independence of all countries, large and small.

Subsequently, peace congresses were held in seventeen countries. National committees for the defense of peace have now been established in forty-six countries. This movement is developing every day.

Not long ago, the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation, which was held in Moscow, confirmed how enthusiastically women from all countries responded to the declaration issued by the Second Congress of the International Federation held in Budapest a year ago. No matter where they are, they bravely and enthusiastically devote themselves to the struggle for peace and national independence. Not only are more and more women understanding that unity and action are necessary, but their struggle has also been strengthened due to political awareness.

Millions of Chinese women have fought alongside men to liberate the whole country from imperialist control, and they are still fighting. They participate in the land reform movement; they fight for the development of culture and the elimination of illiteracy; they, together with the government and the people, are building their country into the most advanced fortress of peace forces in Asia, smashing the imperialists' attempts to launch a new war.

Women in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya are fighting against imperialist warmongers and colonialists together with their people. Two million Vietnamese women have joined the Vietnamese Women's Federation to strengthen their combat capabilities.

In Japan, the movement against U.S. imperialism is gradually expanding. Japanese women prepared to participate in our conference with unparalleled enthusiasm. They widely publicized the convening of our conference among the Japanese women masses. However, the U.S. occupation authorities, fearing that they would unite with democratic forces in other places, did not allow them to leave Japan.

In India and Iran, regardless of the brutal oppression of democratic forces by the imperialist running dogs, women are forever participating in the struggle for national independence in increasing numbers. In Syria and Lebanon, this movement has also been greatly strengthened.

Greek women also participated in the heroic battle of the Greek people.

The same is true in France and Italy, where tens of millions of women have long been awakened from political life and are launching an active struggle to defend peace and oppose the imperialist warmongers and their running dog domestic governments. Women in imperialist countries have also begun to understand that a nation that oppresses another nation will not be free itself, and that the struggle for the independence of colonial nations is also their own struggle, because it is part of the common struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism.

Women in Latin America, in Cuba, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, have taken active steps to combat U.S. imperialism, which wants to turn their countries into semi-colonies.

British and American women have begun to point out the facts of the danger of war and have shown an increasingly strong action to fight for peace.

Even in fascist dictatorial countries like Spain, the struggle is developing in terror, and the recent arrest of a group of peasant women and their sentencing for assisting guerrillas is good evidence.

In Germany, hundreds of thousands of women organized under the German Women's Federation support the government of the German Democratic Republic and actively fight for the unity of their country, for the eradication of fascism, and for the formation of a force for peace.

In the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Albania, and Bulgaria, millions of women actively support their governments' peace policies.

Soviet women, as early as before the war, had fully supported and supported their government, fighting to unite all forces for peace and to eliminate war. Soviet women contributed their strength, their wisdom, their talents, and even their lives by the thousands and tens of thousands, along with their millions of men, to defeat Hitler's Germany and Japanese imperialism. Soviet women stand firmly at the forefront of all peace-loving women in the world.

Their experience and heroism in the struggle for peace, just as in the patriotic war in socialist countries in the past, ignite the hearts of women all over the world, of mothers all over the world, and inspire their strength. Because they all yearn to spare their children, their families, and their countries from the horrors of imperialist war.

We can see clearly that the world's peace camp is expanding day by day, and it is a matter of pride for us that the 59 national women's federation organizations of the Women's International Democratic Federation are also actively participating in this camp.

But we should not be intoxicated by this success, the danger still exists. Because the expansion of the people's movement and the increase in strength have further aroused the madness of the imperialist bandits, they have not abandoned their conspiracy plans to prepare for an anti-Soviet war.

Because of the continuous strengthening of the peace front, their constant barking and provocations will no longer be effective. Therefore, they used other means, sending the most vile and shameless slanders to the Soviet Union, hoping to deceive the people with this, trying to make them believe that it was the Soviet Union that was threatening peace, so as to divert their attention. But all the people clearly see the Soviet Union's peace policy and support the Soviet Union's peace policy.

Thus, the imperialists used even more insidious methods. They bought off Tito and the Yugoslav bandits, betraying the people of Yugoslavia or the entire democratic camp. They are driving organizations that conspire for war but pretend to be for peace. Therefore, we must be extra vigilant, oppose those traitors, and expose the chauvinistic ideas that enemy spies attempt to use to divide the peace camp. In order to effectively strike the warmongers and their running dogs, we should simultaneously expand and increasingly strengthen our ranks. This is the responsibility of the Women's International Democratic Federation established after the Second World War.

The Women's International Democratic Federation invites national democratic women's federations to join the ranks of the masses of the people to oppose the instigators of the Third World War and to oppose the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Pact. The Women's International Democratic Federation has led a vast army to oppose atomic weapons and other weapons of mass slaughter. This movement has received the support of women all over the world, and the tens of millions of signed letters sent to the United Nations are clear evidence of this. The Women's International Democratic Federation has directed women in imperialist countries to oppose colonial wars and armed intervention in Greece, and to support the struggle of Greek women for national independence. The International Federation led the resistance against the terrorist forces in Greece and Spain, and also opposed the arrests, torture, and all the atrocities against democrats in Argentina, Lebanon, and Iran, also condemned the massacre of women in India; and organized investigation teams to visit Spain, Southeast Asia and Algeria.

The Women's International Democratic Federation is also the initiator of this Asian Women's Conference. The mission of the Asian Women's Conference is to help Asian women solve all the major problems facing the Asian people and them, first of all their struggle for national independence. At the same time, the conference also includes the responsibility of women in imperialist countries to strengthen their struggle against imperialist governments, to demand an immediate end to colonial wars and armed intervention, and to provide solidarity and support to sisters in oppressed countries.

In the Women's International Democratic Federation, an organization that fights for their ideals, all women demand to defend democracy, national independence, and the rights of women and children. Therefore, at each meeting of the Council, new organizations have requested to join the Women's International Democratic Federation. The last Council approved the participation of the Japanese Democratic Women's Committee, the Israeli Shita Women's Federation, the Ecuadorian Women's Union, and the Bolivian Peace Women's Congress. Therefore, there are now 59 member countries participating in the Women's International Democratic Federation.

In order to properly fulfill the mission of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the Executive Committee adopted the following decisions at its last meeting:

--In order to continue to develop and expand the struggle for peace, the main task is to actively participate in the work of expanding the ranks of the masses of the people proposed by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress; to immediately stop the war of slaughter in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya; to immediately implement disarmament and ban the use of atomic weapons, and to conclude a peace treaty among the great powers.

--Actively participate in all international and local conferences and meetings to defend peace, such as participating in national or local peace organizations, and launching peace organizations in cities, towns, and all public and private organizations.

--Strive to promote the active participation of all working women in the struggle for peace. In order to achieve this goal, the special circumstances of the women's movement in various countries should be combined with the general democratic women's movement.

The Women's International Democratic Federation and its national organizations should especially assist Asian and African women in the correct struggle for national independence, should actively participate in this Asian Women's Representative Conference, should widely publicize the results of this conference, and should participate in the implementation of its resolutions.

The Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation requests the women's organizations of all countries to pay special attention to the fact that during the period of the expansion of the economic crisis in capitalist countries and the increasing hardship of workers' living standards due to capital plunder, it is necessary to more closely unite the struggle for peace and for workers' economic rights, and should actively support those who increase wages, reduce prices, improve working conditions and reduce military spending.

In order to ensure the solidarity of all peace-loving people, women's organizations in all countries should maintain close cooperation with all other democratic organizations, trade unions, youth groups, peace organizations, cultural circles, and scientific circles.

The Council approved the proposal to designate June 1 as International Children's Day.

The tasks placed before us are huge, and there are still many difficulties ahead. But we women and mothers are determined to contribute our strength and spare no sacrifice in order to guarantee our children a happy life in a peaceful world.

Due to our actions and our struggle in the anti-imperialist democratic camp, all nations in the world will become free nations one by one.

Long live the Soviet women who were the first to gain freedom!

Long live the liberation of the Chinese people and the liberation of Chinese women!

Long live the People's Republic of China and her leader Chairman Mao!

Long live the struggle of all Asian women for national independence!

Long live the International Anti-Imperialist League!

Long live the Women's International Democratic Federation!
