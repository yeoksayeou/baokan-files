Who Should Bear the Burden of the Victory Bonds
    Wang Xinyuan

    1950 is the year for consolidating the victory of the Chinese revolution. Except for Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet, which are yet to be liberated, all organized bandit gangs on the mainland have been wiped out. Our task is to consolidate this great victory and simultaneously begin the planned construction of our New China. In the economic sphere, it is to restore and develop our production. After eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan and four years of the War of Liberation, what the Kuomintang reactionaries left us is a situation riddled with holes. We must methodically and properly heal it, restore its vitality, and move towards a bright future. Naturally, there will be some difficulties inevitable in victory! The People's Government's decision to issue construction bonds pegged to commodity prices is one way to solve these difficulties. Regarding the issuance of these bonds and the thorough consideration given to the interests of the people, I think no one among the people does not wholeheartedly support it. The question is how to make its issuance most fair and reasonable, that is, who should be the bearer of the victory. Regarding this point, I would like to offer some suggestions for reference.

    (1) China's peasants are the glorious bearers of victory. In these past ten years of struggle, they not only contributed most of the money and food, but also sacrificed their own lives. Each year, apart from maintaining their own lives, all their surplus has been contributed to the state in the form of public grain for supporting the front, tax burdens, and so on. It is practically impossible to increase their burden further. Next year, they will still bear 41.4% of the total fiscal revenue in the form of public grain, and bear most of the tax revenue through burden-shifting. Therefore, they should no longer be the main bearers of the public bonds. I think this point is generally acknowledged.

    (2) The total amount of the public bonds is only 200 million shares, which should not be a large number in the eyes of the people in the cities. We are confident that it can be borne. However, the disparity between rich and poor in the cities is very large, with some wealthy merchants and magnates living like princes and nobles, and some refugees and unemployed people without a place to stand. Who exactly should be the bearers of the public bonds? I think we can test the sense of responsibility of people from all walks of life towards the People's Government through the proportion of issuance and purchase of these bonds.

    First, the workers and employees in the cities are already masters of the country and the leading class of the People's Government. They will not lag behind, and they will certainly contribute whatever strength they can. However, we should know that the living standards of Chinese workers and public employees today are not very high. They have increased their enthusiasm for production and work and contributed all their strength without reservation. We should not have unfair or excessively high expectations in the allocation of public bonds.

    Second, industrialists and businessmen occupy a major position in today's urban economy and are one of the pillars of the People's Government. They should be the main bearers of this public bond purchase. Do they have the ability to bear it? Some industrialists and businessmen are shouting about insufficient working capital, poor business, and so on! In certain special areas and periods, industrialists and businessmen do have some difficulties. However, compared to the difficulties of the peasants, those are very small, temporary, and can be overcome. I think industrialists and businessmen should consider the following aspects: (1) Even if there are difficulties, they are temporary. If the issuance of public bonds can stabilize prices to a considerable extent and prevent them from rising and falling sharply, it will be of great long-term benefit to the operation of industry and commerce. (2) Public bonds can absorb idle social capital, reduce speculative activities, and promote industry and commerce to practice economy and oppose waste. At present, the industrial and commercial sectors have not achieved complete rationality in the use of funds. Waste of materials and personal lifestyles can also be saved to some extent. If industrialists and businessmen can also seriously plan like the government and "squeeze" out a little "savings"—public bonds—step by step and with methods, is it impossible? Taking an ordinary factory as an example, if a factory already has a 10% profit, it will not feel difficult to withdraw 5-10% of its monthly net profit for savings—purchasing public bonds. I think industrialists and businessmen, after clarifying the above calculations, will surely become a very willing bearer.

    Third, urban real estate holders should also be bearers of public bonds. Although people who live on real estate income may still consider it a kind of capitalist investment, real estate holders in China are somewhat inseparable from landlords, local tyrants, warlords, bureaucrats, compradors, and usurers. We don't need to talk about the process of their capital accumulation now, but we, the common people, have the right to demand that they become bearers of public bonds.

    Fourth, urban gold and cash holders should also be bearers of public bonds. In addition to the means of production, real estate, and goods, the asset form of the bourgeoisie also includes a lot of hidden gold and cash. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, hiding gold and cash was a last resort, and we should sympathize with their situation. However, today we have embarked on the broad road of national construction, and hiding gold and cash not only occupies the market of the Renminbi, but also becomes the basic driving force of the black market. I think the People's Government can adopt appropriate prices to absorb this part of the seemingly frozen idle capital in society. Under reasonable prices, they may voluntarily change to a savings method, or mobilize these idle funds into productive enterprises, which is also beneficial and harmless.

    Fifth, landlords and rich peasants in newly liberated areas have money to invest in public bonds, which is beneficial to both the country and themselves.

    Sixth, overseas Chinese capital is likely to be mobilized back to the country in large numbers. Overseas Chinese have always had a glorious history of contributing to the revolution. In particular, a considerable number of national capitalists who were deceived by the propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionaries and fled to Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia. If they can be mobilized well to return and engage in legitimate industrial and commercial undertakings, purchasing public bonds is an opportunity to guide them back to the motherland, and they have the ability to become a glorious bearer.

    In short, the amount of this victory bond pegged to commodity prices is not very large, and the number of people who can and should bear it is also very large. Among the burdens of industrialists and businessmen, a part will inevitably be indirectly passed on to the peasants. Therefore, although peasants are not formally our target of recruitment, they actually still bear some burdens. When the Soviet Union recruited construction bonds, it was always fully subscribed within 24 hours. In China, because this is the first time to raise bonds, and the general public still retains some resentment and vestiges of the reactionary era regarding the concept of public bonds, it is necessary to conduct extensive publicity and explanation in advance, and regard it as an important political task. Fundamentally break the old concept of public bonds and establish an understanding of the new public bonds. In particular, industrialists and businessmen should demonstrate their progressive spirit and strength!

### 谁是胜利公债的负担者

　　谁是胜利公债的负担者
    王新元
    一九五○年是中国革命巩固胜利的一年，除了台湾海南岛和西藏尚待解放以外，在大陆上已经歼灭了一切成股的匪帮。我们的任务，是要巩固这一伟大的胜利。同时开始有计划地建设我们的新中国。在经济方面，就是要恢复和发展我们的生产。中国经过八年抗战和四年解放战争，国民党反动派所遗留给我们的，真是一个百孔千疮的局面。我们要有步骤而妥善的医治它，恢复它的元气，走向光明的前途，自然有若干胜利中不可避免的困难！这次人民政府通过发行建设折实公债，就是解决这些困难的办法之一。对于这次公债的发行和照顾人民利益的周到，我想没有一个人民不是忠心拥护的。问题只是在如何使他发行得最公平合理，就是说谁应该是胜利的负担者。对于这一点，我想提供一点意见，以供参考。
    （一）中国的农民是胜利的光荣的负担者。在这十几年的战斗中，他们不仅出了大部分的金钱、粮食，而且贡献了自己的生命。他们每年的收入，除了维持自己的生活以外，一切剩余的东西，都以公粮支前和税捐转嫁等等方式，贡献给国家了。实际上不可能再增加对他们的负担。明年他们仍然要以公粮的形式，负担全部财政收入的百分之四一．四，并经过转嫁而负担税收的大部分，因此他们不应该再是公债的主要的负担者。这一点我想是大家所公认的。
    （二）公债的总额，共计不过二万万分，这一个数字，在都市的人民看来，不应该是一个大的数字。我们有把握相信是可以担负起来的。但是在都市中贫富的悬殊很大，有富比王侯的达商巨贾，有穷无立锥之地的难民和失业者。究竟又是些什么人，应该是公债的负担者呢？我以为我们可以从这次公债的发行和承购的比例中，考验出各阶层人民对人民政府的责任感。
    第一、是都市的工友们，他们已经是国家的主人，而且是人民政府的领导阶级，他们是不会落后的，他们必然会贡献他们可能贡献的力量。但是我们应该知道，今天中国的工人和公教人员的生活水平很不高，他们提高了生产和工作的积极性，把所有力量都无保留地贡献出来，在公债的分摊上，我们不应该存着不公平的和过高的奢望。
    第二、是工商业者，在今天的城市经济中，他们占着主要的地位。而且也是人民政府中的支柱之一。对于这一次公债的承购，他们应该是最主要的负担者。他们是不是有负担的能力呢？有些工商业者，都在叫喊，周转资金不足，生意不好等等！在某一特殊的区域与时期，工商业者确实有些困难的。但是比较农民的困难来说，那是很小的，暂时的，有办法克服的。我觉得工商业者，应该从下列的几方面去打算（１）即令有困难也是暂时的，如果因为公债的发行可以相当的稳定物价，不致暴涨暴落，对于工商业的经营，基本上是有远大利益的。（２）公债可以吸收社会游资，减少投机活动，并可促进工商业实行节约反对浪费，现在工商业界对于资金的运用，并没有达到完全合理的地步。物力的浪费，与个人的生活方式，也是有可能节约一些的。如果工商业者也能够象政府一样的认真的计划一下，有步骤有办法的“挤”出一点“储蓄”——公债——来，是不可能的吗？以普通的工厂而论。如果某一工厂已经有百分之十的盈利，在他的一个月的纯益中提出百分之五—十来储蓄——承购公债，是不会感到困难的。我想工商业者，把上面的算盘打清楚，是必然会成为一个很乐意的负担者。
    第三、都市房地产握有者，也应该是公债的负担者。依靠房地产生活的人民，虽然也还可能认为是一种资本主义性质的投资。但是中国房地产的持有者，与地主豪绅军阀官僚买办和高利贷者是有些分不开的。他们的资本的积累过程，现在不必去说它，可是我们老百姓，有权利要求他们成为一个公债负担者。
    第四、都市的金钞持有者也应该是公债的负担者。资产阶级的资产形式，除了生产手段房地产和货物以外，还有不少暗藏的金钞。在国民党反动派统治时期，暗藏金钞是迫不得已的，我们应该同情他的处境。但是今天已经走向建国的康庄大道上面来了，暗藏金钞，不仅侵占了人民币的市场，而且成为黑市的基本动力。我以为人民政府，可以采取适当的价格，吸收社会上这一部分形似冻结的游资。在合理的价格之下，他们有可能自愿更换一种储蓄的方式，或者动员这些游资到生产事业中去，也是有利无害的。
    第五、新解放区的地主富农是有钱投入公债的，这样既有利于国家，也有利于自己。
    第六、华侨资本很可能大批动员回国。华侨对于革命的贡献，向来是有光荣的历史。尤其受国民党反动派欺骗的宣传而逃往香港菲律宾和南洋等处的民族资本，为数不少。如果能够很好的动员他们回来，从事正当的工商事业。承购公债正是引导他们返回祖国的一个机会，他们是有能力成为一个光荣的负担者。
    总之，这一次的胜利折实公债数目并不很大，能够而且应该负担的人数也很多，在工商业者的负担中，必然还有一部分间接转嫁到农民身上去。所以农民虽然在形式上不是我们征募的对象，而实际上还是有些负担的。在苏联征募建国公债的时候，每次都是在二十四小时内就募足了。在中国因为这是第一次的募债，而且一般人民对于公债的观念，还保留了反动派时代的一些余恨和遗毒。所以要在事前进行广泛的宣传和解释，把它当作一个重要的政治任务来看待。在基本上打破旧公债的观念，建立对新公债的认识。尤其是工商业者，应该表现自己的进步精神和力量来！
