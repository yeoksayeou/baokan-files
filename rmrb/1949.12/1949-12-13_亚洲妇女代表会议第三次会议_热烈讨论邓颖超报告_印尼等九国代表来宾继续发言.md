Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: The Asian Women's Representatives Conference held its third session today, continuing discussions on the report by Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, on "Asian Women's Struggle for National Independence, People's Democracy, and World Peace," and listened to the report of the Credentials Committee. Speakers at today's meeting included Indonesian representative Lela Suripno, Dutch guest Lips Adingnot, Vietnamese representative Ho Thi Minh, French guest Ginette Vermeersch, Israeli representative Rose Robi District, Czech guest Anna Hoderova, Syrian representative Amenie Alef, Algerian guest Baya Alaouchiche, and Soviet representative Bafinova.

Lela Suripno, after describing the heroic struggle of Indonesian women and the Indonesian people, said: Indonesian women and the Indonesian people must, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, form a unified national united front and participate in the world peace and democracy camp in order to be liberated and to ensure a bright and happy future for Indonesian women and children. Dutch guest Lips Adingnot said: The Dutch imperialists' aggression against Indonesia directly affects the lives of the Dutch working people and brings great suffering to the families of the Indonesian and Dutch people. The Dutch people will strengthen the movement against aggressive war and support the struggle of Indonesian women and the Indonesian people for freedom and independence.

Ho Thi Minh, in her speech, first pointed out: The convening of the Asian Women's Representatives Conference is a great encouragement to the people of Vietnam. She said: The Vietnamese people have only one demand, and that is independence! Only one hope, and that is democracy! Only one government, and that is the government led by President Ho Chi Minh. The Vietnamese people are engaged in a heroic struggle until they achieve final victory. Ho Thi Minh expressed her heartfelt gratitude for the friendly assistance of Soviet women to Vietnamese women, and also thanked the victory of the Chinese people for eliminating the enemy on one side of Vietnam's border. She also expressed sincere friendship to French women and hoped that the French people would use various means to launch a more vigorous struggle against French imperialism. After Ho Thi Minh concluded her moving speech, the entire audience stood up and applauded enthusiastically, expressing their respect for the fighting Vietnamese women and the Vietnamese people. French guest Ginette Vermeersch expressed the French people's determination to support the Vietnamese national liberation war. He pointed out: The war launched by imperialism against colonial countries not only harms the people of colonial countries, but also harms the French people.

When Soviet representative Bafinova began to speak, the entire audience stood up and welcomed her with a storm of applause. On behalf of Soviet women, she paid tribute to the conference, to the heroic Chinese women, and to Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people. She hoped that Chinese women would achieve greater success in the construction of a free new China. She exposed the shameless war propaganda of the US imperialists, saying: They try to confuse the people of all countries, as if there is a danger on the Soviet side. However, the truth cannot be concealed. Mothers all over the world declare that they will never send their sons to fight the Soviet Union, and they will stand up to defend themselves and their children. She assured the conference that Soviet women warmly sympathize with the struggle of Asian women. She said: When you encounter difficulties in your life and struggle, please remember: you have loyal friends - the Soviet people! Her speech was repeatedly interrupted by thunderous applause. Everyone shouted "Long live Stalin!" "Learn from Soviet sisters!" People were moved by the irrepressible enthusiasm and sang "March of the Motherland" in various languages. The enthusiastic atmosphere of the meeting reached its climax in the past three days.

During today's meeting, the Dutch representative presented gifts to the Indonesian representative, fourteen French women's groups presented flags to Chinese women, the Vietnamese representative presented flags to the International Democratic Women's Federation and Chinese women, the French and Vietnamese representatives exchanged gifts, the Korean representative presented gifts to the conference and the Chinese representative, Chinese women presented gifts to the conference, to Stalin, and to Mrs. Gordon, the August 1st Elementary School of the Chinese People's Liberation Army presented flowers to the conference, and the Vietnamese representative presented gifts to the Soviet representative.

    丽拉·索里普诺在叙述了印尼妇女和印尼人民英勇斗争的情况之后：印尼妇女和印尼的人民，必须在印尼共产党的领导下，结成全民族的统一战线，参加世界和平民主阵营，才能得到解放，才能使印尼的妇女、儿童有光明和幸福的将来。荷兰来宾利普斯·阿丁诺特说：荷兰帝国主义者对印尼的侵略，直接影响了荷兰劳动人民的生活，并且给印尼和荷兰人民的家庭带来极大的痛苦。荷兰人民将加强反对侵略战争的运动，支持印尼妇女和印尼人民争取自由独立的斗争。
    胡德明在发言里面首先指出：亚洲妇女代表会议的召开，这对于越南的人民是一个很大的鼓舞。她说：越南人民只有一个要求，那就是独立！只有一个希望，那就是民主！只有一个政府，那就是胡志明主席领导的政府。越南人民正在做着英勇的斗争，直到争取了最后胜利为止。胡德明以热情的语句感谢苏联妇女对于越南妇女的友情援助，也感谢中国人民的胜利使越南国境的一面没有了敌人。她又向法国妇女表示真挚的友谊，并希望法国人民用各种方式更猛烈地展开反对法国帝国主义的斗争。胡德明结束了她动人的发言之后，全场一致起立热烈鼓掌，向战斗的越南妇女和越南人民表示敬意。法国来宾金耐特·凡尔米什表示了法国人民支持越南民族解放战争的决心。他指出：帝国主义所发动的对殖民地国家的战争，不但伤害着殖民地国家的人民，同样地也伤害着法国人民。
