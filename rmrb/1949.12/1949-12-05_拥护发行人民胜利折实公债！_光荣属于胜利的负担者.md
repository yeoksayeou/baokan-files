Support the Issuance of People's Victory Indexed Bonds!
　　Glory Belongs to Those Who Bear the Burden of Victory
　　Guo Moruo

　　The People's Government, in order to rapidly complete the Liberation War, stabilize the people's livelihood, and actively engage in construction, is going to issue "People's Victory Indexed Bonds." I thoroughly support this plan, and I believe all Chinese compatriots will also thoroughly support it.

　　The issuance of this bond is not only very important in its significance, but also very considerate in its method, which is enough to prove that the People's Government is thinking of the people in everything and is responsible to the people.

　　Our People's Liberation War has achieved unprecedentedly great victory, overthrown the reactionary rule of the trinity of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and produced a People's Republic of China where the people are the masters. This is a great celebration for all Chinese people, and also a great celebration for all progressive people in the world.

　　But with such an unprecedented great celebration, we must increase our glorious burden. We must understand this, and it is easy to understand.

　　For example, a mother gives birth to a healthy baby after ten months of pregnancy, which is a joyous occasion. But the mother has suffered long-term burdens and losses during the ten months of pregnancy, and the pain and bleeding before and after childbirth are actually equivalent to a serious illness. The mother's body must rest for at least a month. Moreover, immediately after delivery, there is the responsibility of raising the infant by breastfeeding, which will take at least three or two years. If the mother's milk is not enough, she will have to hire a wet nurse, raise goats, or buy milk powder, etc., and the expenses are countless.

　　Raising an infant involves such unavoidable burdens. But parents, especially mothers, forget that this is a burden and only feel the joy, the glory, and the family responsibility. No matter how much they save on clothing and food, and endure hardships, they always happily raise the infant to adulthood.

　　If we expand this kind of family affairs, we can easily understand the government's difficulties in having to issue bonds today, when we have created a great People's Democratic Republic.

　　Our country has been subjected to long-term exploitation by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, followed by twelve years of long-term war. Today, although the war has basically been won, a small number of areas still need to be liberated, and it is expected that it will not be completely over until next year. In addition, the rampant destruction and shameless blockade by the remnants of the enemy, and the fact that imperialism is adding fuel to the fire, deliberately obstructing our construction. We still need to make great efforts to eliminate internal and external enemies and restore the wounds of war. In addition to the loss of productivity, we must also maintain the necessary military and government expenditures, which will inevitably increase our burden. But this is a joyous burden, a glorious burden, a victorious burden. To consolidate and expand our victory, we should only feel joy and glory, and forget that it is a burden.

　　In order to overcome the current difficulties and shorten the suffering of the people, the government has come up with this good way to issue bonds, and there is no doubt that all the people of China will wholeheartedly support it. This is borrowing everyone's money to do everyone's business. Rather than calling it "public debt," it should be called "public responsibility." Because it is our people's common responsibility to quickly build a new China!

　　The issuance of this bond is indeed very thoughtful in its method. The amount of the issuance is not large, and it is calculated in real terms, with interest and guarantees, and the principal and interest will be fully repaid within a period of only five years. This is in fact a real-term time deposit, which not only does not cause any loss to the people, but is also a very profitable investment.

　　How can it be said to be a very profitable investment? Because this bond is a constructive bond, a productive bond. The purpose of the bond itself is to eliminate the remnants of the enemy, consolidate national defense, heal wounds, and restore production. These are all extremely important to the people's lives. When these goals are achieved, the people's lives will be safely guaranteed, and the country will prosper and move towards prosperity. Temporarily saving a small amount of money to give the country some turnover and obtain long-term benefits, isn't this a very profitable investment?

　　The guarantee is absolutely safe, please look at our Northeast! When the war was still going on the year before last and last year, the finances had suffered difficulties and prices had fluctuated considerably. But this year, after the remnants of the enemy were eliminated and production gradually returned to normal, the people of the Northeast not only got a stable and happy life, but also had a lot of surplus to support the Liberation War in the rest of the country. Isn't this an excellent example?

　　The guarantee is absolutely safe, please look at our closest friendly country, the Soviet Union! In the thirty-two years after the October Revolution just succeeded, the difficulties suffered by the Soviet people were many times greater than those we have suffered. For example, at the turn of 1921 and 1922, the railways in Siberia lacked coal, and passengers on the train chopped firewood station by station along the way to supply fuel for the locomotive, so that the train could continue to run. This difficult situation is beyond our imagination. But what is the Soviet Union like today? After only a few five-year plan constructions, has it not already become the world's strongest fortress of peace?

　　These facts tell us that as long as the people are in charge, even if there are short-term difficulties, they can be quickly overcome by the joint efforts of all the people.

　　Today, we are not afraid of difficulties, but only of not having a solution. Now that we have a solution, and a good one, with great certainty, let us quickly implement it and overcome all difficulties.

　　It is time for the national bourgeoisie's industrial and commercial circles to particularly express their sense of ownership. In the Liberation War, the working class and the peasant class contributed the most, and almost all of the public grain and military grain came from the peasants. In order to protect industry and commerce, the state's taxation is limited. Today, we cannot further increase the burden on the working class and peasant class. Their responsibility is mainly to engage in the restoration of production. The petty bourgeoisie has the will but not the power, and what is expected of them is to pay more attention to cutting expenditure and to fulfill the responsibility of encouragement and persuasion. Therefore, friends in industrial and commercial circles should now take the lead and show an attitude of "not giving way to others."

　　In the face of all difficulties, in the face of all the remaining enemies, let us show our power! With only that 20 million shares of bonds, let us buy them all in one go. Let the government only issue them once next year, without having to issue them in installments again.

　　Building the country is everyone's responsibility. Let me say it again, the issuance of this "People's Victory Indexed Bonds" is actually a "public responsibility" rather than a "public debt." Since the bonds are indexed, the people will not suffer any loss, and in fact, it is only equivalent to a regular indexed savings. Why not buy such bonds?

　　The People's Government is thinking of the people in everything and is responsible to the people in everything. The prudence and thoughtfulness in issuing this bond this time is the best proof. It is not that there is no way to avoid issuing bonds, such as increasing taxes or issuing more banknotes, which can make up for the moment. But that would not only unilaterally put the burden on the people, but also have a shrinking effect on the economy, making the people's lives more unstable. Therefore, the government does not do that, but adopts the issuance of this constructive productive bond.

　　I thoroughly support this plan, and I believe that all Chinese compatriots, especially compatriots in industry and commerce, will also thoroughly support it.

　　Glory belongs to those who bear the burden of victory!

    拥护发行人民胜利折实公债！
　　光荣属于胜利的负担者
    郭沫若
    人民政府为了迅速完成解放战争，安定人民生活，以便积极从事建设，要发行“人民胜利折实公债”，这一计划我是彻底拥护的，我想全中国的同胞们也都会彻底拥护的。
    这一次公债的发行不仅在意义上非常的重要，就是在办法上也是非常的周到，足以证明人民政府是事事都在替人民设想，对人民负责的。
    我们的人民解放战争获得了空前伟大的胜利，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三位一体的反动统治，产生了一个人民作主的中华人民共和国，这是全中国人民的大喜庆，也是全世界进步人民的大喜庆。
    但有了这样一个史无先例的大喜庆，我们就必须增加了光荣的负担。这事我们必须了解，而且是容易了解的。
    譬如一位母亲经过十月怀胎生下了一个肥胖的婴儿，这是喜庆事。但在做母亲的人有了十月怀胎的长期累赘和亏损，又加上临盆前后的痛苦与流血，实际上是等于害了一场大病。母体为此必须静养至少一个月。而且在分娩之后，立刻又加上了哺乳婴儿的抚育责任，这起码又须得累赘三两年。假使母奶不够，还须得雇奶母、畜山羊、或买奶粉等，破费是在所不计的。
    养育了一个婴儿，就要有这样不可避免的负担。但是做父母的人，特别是做母亲的人，谁都忘记了这是负担，而只感觉着是喜庆、是光荣、是天伦上的责任。自己无论怎样省衣缩食，含辛茹苦，总是高高兴兴地把婴儿抚养成人的。
    我们如把这种家常事务扩大起来看，在我们产生了一个伟大的人民民主共和国的今天，政府不得不发行公债的苦衷，便可以迎刃而解了。
    我们的国家是经过了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的长期剥削的，又继以十二年的长期战争。今天战争虽然基本胜利了，但少数地区还待解放，预计要到明年才能全部结束。更加以残匪的疯狂破坏，无耻封锁，而帝国主义更在推波助涛，蓄意阻挠我们的建设。我们要清扫内外的敌人，恢复战争的创伤，还须费很大的努力。在生产力遭了亏损之余，我们还必须维持必要的军费和政费，这就必然要增加我们的负担。但这是喜庆的负担，光荣的负担，胜利的负担。我们要巩固并扩大我们的胜利，是应该只感觉到是喜庆，是光荣，而忘记了它是负担才是。
    政府为了要克服当前的困难，并缩短人民的痛苦，想出了这次发行公债的好办法，毫无疑问我们全中国的人民一定是衷心拥护的。这是借大家的钱来办大家的事，与其说是“公债”倒应该说是“公责”。因为赶快把新中国建设好，是我们人民公共的责任呀！
    这次公债的发行，就在办法上也的确是想得很周到。发行的数量并不多，而且是折实计算，有利息，有保障，仅仅在五年的期限内便要连本带利全部还完。这在事实上是折实的定期储蓄，对于人民不仅毫无亏损，而且是一本万利的。
    怎么说是一本万利呢？因为这一次的公债是建设性的公债，生产性的公债。公债的用途本身是在肃清残敌巩固国防、医治创伤、恢复生产、这些都是于人民生活极关紧要的事。这些目的一达到了，人民的生活便得到安全的保障，国家便会蒸蒸日上地走上繁荣的境地。暂时储蓄下少许的钱财，使国家得到一些周转，而获得长远的利益，难道这还不是一本万利吗？
    保障是绝对安全的，请看我们的东北吧！在前年去年战争还在进行的时候，财政上曾经遭受过困难，物价也有过相当大的波动。但在今年把残敌肃清了，生产逐渐恢复了正常，东北人民不仅得到了安定而幸福的生活，而且还有很大的余力来支援着关内的解放战争。这不是绝好的范例吗？
    保障是绝对安全的，再请看我们的最亲密的友邦苏联吧！在三十二年前十月革命刚好成功之后，苏联人民比我们所遭受的困难，大到不知道多少倍。例如在一九二一年和二二年之交，西比利亚的铁路都还缺乏煤炭，乘火车的客人沿途走一站砍一站的木柴来供火车头的燃料，这样使火车继续连转。这困难的情形是超出了我们的想象之外的。然而今天的苏联是怎样了？仅仅几次五年计划的建设，不是已经成为世界上的最坚强和平堡垒了吗？
    这些事实告诉我们：只要人民自己作了主，即使有短时间的困难，靠着人民全体的共同努力，也很快便可以克服的。
    我们今天不怕困难，只怕没有办法。现在办法有了，而且很好，很有把握，那我们就赶快实行起来，克服一切的困难吧。
    是民族资产阶级的工商业界特别表示自己的主人翁身分的时候了。在解放战争中工农了阶级出的力量最大，公粮军粮更差不多全部出在农民身上。国家为了保护工商业，税征是有限的。今天我们不能把负担更加重在工农阶级身上了，他们的责任，主要还在从事生产的恢复。小资产阶级是心有余而力不足的，所望于他们的是更加注意在节流方面，尽鼓舞和说服的责任。因此，工商业界的朋友们，在今天便应该拿出力量来，表示出“当仁不让”的态度了。
    在一切困难面前，在一切残余的敌人面前，表示我们的威力吧！只有那么两万万分的公债，我们一口气便把它买完。让明年政府只发行一次，无须乎再分期发行吧。
    建国是大家的责任，这一次的“人民胜利折实公债”的发行，让我再说一遍，其实是“公责”而不是“公债”。公债既折实，一点不让人民吃亏，事实上也只等于定期的折实储蓄。这样的公债何乐而不买呢？
    人民政府是事事都在替人民设想，事事都对人民负责的。发行这一次公债的这样慎重和周到，就是绝好的证明了。不发行公债也并不是没有办法，例如增加税收或者增发钞票，都可以弥补一时。但那样不仅单面地把负担加在人民身上，而且对于经济还会发生萎缩的效果，使人民生活更加不稳定。所以政府不那样做，而采取了这建设性的生产性的公债的发行。
    这一计划我是彻底拥护的，我想全中国的同胞，尤其工商界的同胞们，也一定会彻底拥护。
    光荣属于胜利的负担者！
    （一九四九年十二月四日）
