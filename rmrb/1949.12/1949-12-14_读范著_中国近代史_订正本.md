　　Reading the Revised Edition of Fan's "Modern Chinese History"
    Zhou Sheng
    The revised edition of "Modern Chinese History" by Fan Wenlan, Vice President of North China University, has recently been published by North China University. Compared with the old edition (i.e., the edition printed by Sanlian Bookstore), many places have been revised. For example:
    In the first chapter, regarding the analysis of the opium trade, the old edition stated that China's self-sufficient economic base supported the Qing Dynasty's policy of closing the country to the outside world. British textiles and wool fabrics could not achieve the status of necessities in China. If Britain did not rely on the opium trade, it would be difficult to break down China's door. The new edition states that the self-sufficient economic base supported the closed-door policy, and the closed-door policy protected the feudal economy. This prevented British goods from achieving the status of necessities in China and widespread sales opportunities; if Britain did not rely on the opium trade, coupled with armed attacks, it would be difficult to break down China's door in the short term. Obviously, after revision, the analysis is more in line with historical facts and is more comprehensive.
    In the third chapter, the relationship between the God Worshippers and the Heaven and Earth Society was not described in detail in the old edition. After revision, we have a more detailed understanding of the class nature of the Heaven and Earth Society; the cooperation between the God Worshippers and the Heaven and Earth Society in the early stage of the Taiping Rebellion, the split of the two societies after Hong Daquan's sacrifice, the complete exclusion of the Heaven and Earth Society by the God Worshippers after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom established its capital in Nanjing; and the reasons for the separation and integration of the two societies and their impact on the Taiping Revolution.
    The third chapter discusses the foreign relations of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The old edition said that British fleet commander Hope went to Nanjing in 1860, which is a historical error. Based on this, the analysis that Hope and the Taiping Army made an agreement because the Anglo-French allied forces wanted to attack Tianjin and prevent the Taiping Army from attacking Shanghai is also wrong. The revised edition clarifies that Hope arrived in Nanjing in February 1861, and the agreement with the Taiping Army was to buy time to deploy forces to attack the Taiping Army. Both the textual research and analysis of historical facts are more complete than the old edition.
    In the fifth chapter, regarding the damage caused by the government-run, government-supervised merchant-run, and government-merchant joint-run industries to the private industries in the early stage of China's industry; in the eighth chapter, regarding the persecution of the Chinese people by the evil missionaries; the old edition only mentioned them simply, while the revised edition gives a more detailed description and analysis. The sixth chapter is about the economic aggression of various countries against China and the international situation at that time before the Sino-Japanese War. The seventh chapter is about the changes that took place in China's economy after the Sino-Japanese War. The eighth chapter is about the attitude of the Chinese bourgeoisie towards the Boxer Rebellion... These issues were not mentioned, or hardly mentioned, in the old edition, but the revised edition has supplemented them, and the supplements are quite detailed.
    Comrade Fan Wenlan's "Modern Chinese History" is infused with a basic spirit. Judging from the revisions made in the old and new editions, this spirit is even more obvious. First, strive for the authenticity of historical materials: choose the most reliable version. For example, when quoting "Jing Shan's Diary," the old edition used the translation of "Cixi's Foreign Records," while the new edition used the original text published in "Acta Orienta Lia." Look for original materials. For example, the old edition of the "Pingying Tuan Proclamation" was based on excerpts from "Chinese and Western Chronicles," while the new edition was based on the full text of the original manuscript copied by a contemporary person collected by Song Mo in Huai'an. Examine different records. For example, the old edition failed to clearly describe the separation and integration process of the God Worshippers and the Triads. The new edition verified the true picture of the facts based on the different versions of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom documents such as the "Promulgated Edict" and other records. Distinguish the class nature of the material (which class's work, the author's position in the class struggle at the time, and his purpose), such as the fact that the Qing government asked Costa to help negotiate a peace treaty in the Sino-Japanese War. The old edition only mentioned this matter without analysis. The new edition is based on the fact that Costa was once the US Secretary of State, and he represented the US government in the Sino-Japanese peace negotiations. He said in his "Diplomatic Memoirs" that Japan "should humiliate China as much as possible," and Mutsu Munemitsu, who represented the Japanese government, openly stated that Costa's behavior fully satisfied the Japanese ministers. From the confession of the imperialists, it was confirmed that during the Sino-Japanese War, US imperialism supported Japan in invading China.
    Second, the point of view and method must be historical materialism: seek truth from facts. For example, the new edition re-estimated Li Xiucheng's expression of surrender and deleted about 400 words from the old edition based on the photograph of "Li Xiucheng's Autobiography" in Luo Ergang's "Xiangxiang Zeng's Loyal King Li Xiucheng's Original Confession." Analyze historical events from the perspective of class struggle. The new edition supplements the section on the class nature of the Heaven and Earth Society that was missing in the old edition. Analyze the source of each kind of thought from the class foundation. For example, from the Reform Movement of 1898 to the anti-imperialist movement of the Boxer Rebellion, Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, Tan Sitong, Tang Caichang, and Sun Yat-sen either supported the Qing emperor or fantasized about uniting with the imperialists, did not approach the masses, and their thoughts were inconsistent with each other. The old edition only mentioned these historical facts, but the new edition pointed out, based on more materials, that the reason why Kang, Liang, Tan, Tang, and Sun had such thoughts was determined by the congenital weakness of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal Chinese bourgeoisie. Their thoughts could not be consistent because they represented different classes in the bourgeoisie. The evolution of modern Chinese history is inseparable from the changes in the world situation, and it also affects the world situation. The Chinese revolution is a part of the world revolution. The new edition adds a section "Introduction" in the sixth chapter to describe the impact of changes in the international situation on China; in the eighth chapter, a paragraph is added to describe the international proletariat's sympathy and spiritual and moral assistance to the Boxer Rebellion's anti-imperialist movement, which is much more complete than the old edition. History is developing, and each period has its characteristics. Because the old edition was not strict enough in its wording, it was difficult for people to see clearly the characteristics of each imperialist aggression against China from the Opium War to the Boxer Rebellion. The new edition corrects this shortcoming, allowing readers to understand more clearly the characteristics of each historical event since the Opium War and the characteristics of the development of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle.
    Third, historical science has class character, and scientific history must be the history of the people. Authors and readers should all stand firmly on the people's position. Because the revised edition is richer in materials than the old edition, it exposes the ugliness of the Chinese landlords and comprador class and imperialism more thoroughly; the experience of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle is studied more clearly; and it may be more helpful to today's study of the laws of Chinese history to build a new China.
    These basic spirits of scholarship are not only for studying modern Chinese history, but should be learned by everyone who studies history. In addition, we all know that Fan Wenlan's "Modern Chinese History" was written in Yan'an under extremely inadequate conditions. After coming to Beijing, he collected materials from various sources, sought opinions from various sources, and greatly revised the old edition. This humble attitude of scholarship is even more worthy of learning.

　　读范著“中国近代史”订正本
    周生
    华北大学副校长范文澜著的“中国近代史”，最近订正本由华北大学出版，和旧版（即三联书店印行本）对照起来，改订的地方很多。例如：
    第一章对鸦片贸易的分析，旧版上说，中国自给自足的经济基础，支持着满清的闭关政策，英国布匹和毛织品在中国不能取得必需品的地位，英国如果不依靠鸦片贸易，很难打破中国的大门。新版说，自给自足的经济基础，支持了闭关政策，而闭关政策又保护着封建经济，这使英国商品在中国不能取得必需品的地位和广泛推销的机会；英国如果不依赖鸦片贸易，再加上武装攻击，很难在短期内打破中国的大门。显然经过订正，分析更合于史实，也较为全面了。
    第三章对上帝会和天地会的关系，旧版叙述不详。经过订正，使我们对于天地会的阶级性；对于上帝、天地两会在太平军起义初期的合作，洪大全牺牲后两会的分裂，太平天国定都南京后，上帝会完全排斥天地会的演变过程；以及两会分合的原因与其对太平革命的影响，都有较详细明确的了解。
    第三章论及太平天国的对外关系。旧版说，一八六○年英舰队司令贺布往南京，史实错了；据此而认为贺布和太平军定约，是英法联军要攻天津，防止太平军攻上海，分析也错了。订正本考清了贺布到南京是一八六一年二月，与太平军定约，是争取时间来布置攻击太平军的武力。这样对史实的考证和分析，都比旧版完善。
    第五章关于中国初期工业，官办、官督商办、官商合办对于商办工业的催残；第八章关于恶教士对中国人民的迫害；在旧版中只是简单的提及，订正本都作了较详细的叙述与分析。第六章关于甲午战争以前各国对中国的经济侵略与当时的国际形势。第七章关于甲午战争以后中国经济所发生的变化。第八章关于中国资产阶级对义和团的态度……等问题，在旧版中是没有提到，或者几乎没有提到的，订正版都做了补充，而且补充得相当详细。
    范文澜同志著“中国近代史”，有一种基本精神贯注着。从旧版与新版，改订的地方看来，这种精神更加明显。即第一、史料必力求真实：选择最可靠的版本，如引用“景善日记”，旧版系用“慈祥外记”的译文，新版则用“Ａｃｔａ  Ｏｒｉｅｎｔａ  Ｌｉａ”所载的原文。寻找原始材料，如“平英团告示”，旧版所据为“中西纪事”的摘录，亲版则据淮安宋默所藏当时人抄录的原件全文。考订不同的记载，如上帝会与三合会的分合过程，旧版未能叙述清楚，新版根据“颁行诏书”等太平天国文献版本的不同，与其他记载考证出事实真象。辩别材料的阶级性（哪一个阶级的作品，作者在当时阶级斗争中所处的地位与其目的如何），如甲午战争中，满清政府请科士达助订和约一事，旧版仅仅提到此事并无分析。新版根据科士达曾是美国的国务卿，他代表美国政府参加中日和约交涉，他在“外交回忆录”中说，日本“要尽量屈辱中国”而代表日本政府的陆奥宗光又公开表示，科士达的行为使日本大臣们充分满意，从帝国主义者的自供中，证实了甲午战争的时候，美帝国主义支持日本来侵略中国。
    第二、观点方法必是历史唯物主义：事实求是。如新版据罗尔纲“湘乡曾氏忠王李秀成原供”一文中，“李秀成自述”的摄影，对李秀成表示投降一事，重新估计，删改旧版约四百字。由阶级斗争来分析历史事件，新版补充旧版所没有的天地会的阶级性一段。由阶级基础分析每一种思想的根源，如从戊戌变法到义和团反帝运动，康有为、梁启超、谭嗣同、唐才常、孙中山或者拥戴满清皇帝，或者幻想联合帝国主义，都不接近群众，而彼此思想也不一致。旧版仅只提到这些史事，新版根据更多的材料，指明康、梁、谭、唐、孙所以有这样的思想，是由于半殖民地半封建中国资产阶级的先天软弱病所决定的，他们的思想不能一致，是由于代表着资产阶级中不同阶层而决定的。中国近代史的演变和世界情势的变化是分不开的，而又影响着世界情势，中国革命是世界革命的一部分，新版在第六章增加一节“绪言”，叙述国际形势变化对中国的影响；在第八章增加一段叙述国际无产阶级对义和团反帝运动的同情和精神的道义的援助，比较旧版完善多了。历史是发展的，每一时期都有其特点，旧版因用语上不够严密，所以从鸦片战争到义和团运动，使人不大看得清楚每一次帝国主义的侵略，对中国影响的特点，新版纠正了这一缺点，使读者较清楚的了解鸦片战争以来，每一次历史事件的特点，与中国人民革命斗争发展的特点。
    第三、历史科学有阶级性，科学的历史学，必然是人民的历史，作者与读者都应站稳人民的立场。订正本因为材料比旧版丰富，所以对于中国大地主大买办阶级与帝国主义的丑恶，揭露得更彻底；对于中国人民革命斗争的经验研究得更清楚；对于今天学习中国历史的规律以建设新中国，可能帮助更大一些。
    这几种治学的基本精神，不止学习中国近代史，凡是研究史学的人都应当学习的。另外我们都知道范文澜这本“中国近代史”，是在延安材料极不充足的条件下写成的，来到北京以后，多方搜集材料，多方征求意见，对旧版大加订正。这种虚心的治学态度，更是应当学习的。
