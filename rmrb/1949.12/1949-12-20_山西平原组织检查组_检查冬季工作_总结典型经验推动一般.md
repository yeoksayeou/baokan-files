The Shanxi Plain Organizes Inspection Teams
　　Inspect Winter Work
　　Summarize Typical Experiences to Promote General Improvements
　　[Our Newspaper] The Shanxi Provincial People's Government dispatched sixty cadres from various departments on the eighth of this month to form eighteen inspection teams to delve into various special districts, counties, districts, and villages to inspect and promote winter work. Since the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Committee in early September, the leading organs at the provincial and special district/county levels have convened various meetings to convey and deploy the autumn and winter tasks. By mid-November, winter work in various places had gradually unfolded. This inspection focuses on winter production (including urban-rural material exchange, cooperatives, autumn grain requisition, and burdening), land reform in new areas, winter literacy campaigns, and representative conferences at all levels; secondly, the leadership style of cadres. The purpose is mainly to examine the deployment and progress of work in various places, the implementation of relevant policies and guidelines, existing problems, and what opinions and requirements the masses have, and to discover typical experiences from which to promote comprehensive improvements, thereby strengthening leadership over winter work and preparing for major production next year. Before the departure, under the principles of unified leadership and focused inspection, the cadres from the five departments of agriculture, civil affairs, finance, education, and commerce, as well as the Labor Bureau and the Cooperative General Society, etc., based on the different nature of each department, fully deliberated and prepared for the relevant key inspection contents. The inspection scope includes six special districts, including Yuci, Fenyang, Xingxian, Changzhi, Yicheng, and Xinxian, as well as Taiyuan City; the duration is approximately one and a half months. At the mobilization meeting for all cadres going to the countryside on the 5th of this month, Provincial Government Vice Chairmen Pei Lisheng, Wang Shiying, and Provincial Party Committee Deputy Secretary Lai Ruoyu personally gave instructions, pointing out that this inspection should be based on the autumn and winter work guidelines and tasks stipulated by the Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Committee, combined with the requirements of the local masses, and emphasized the following points: 1. The thinking of leaders at all levels in implementing policies and at turning points in work, and the reactions of the masses, overcoming the common problem of government cadres only looking at issues from the perspective of completing tasks. 2. Accurately and comprehensively criticize problems, understand the current work situation, and at the same time, connect with history and the development process, avoiding the one-sided view of only seeing shortcomings and finding faults. 3. Conduct in-depth investigations of good and bad typical cases in one or two villages or urban and rural areas with a focus, and strictly implement the reporting system. 4. Conduct inspection work from the perspective of concrete assistance, and the attitude must be humble and cautious, listening attentively to the opinions of cadres and the masses, opposing the work style of "imperial envoys" and "cursory inspections." Shanxi Daily also published a short commentary, suggesting that various places should carefully summarize the experience of inspection work in order to better utilize this working method and give full play to its great role.
　　[Another Dispatch] In order to strengthen leadership in winter production, the Agriculture Department of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government has organized a three-person work team to go to the counties of Hua County and Xinxiang, etc., on the first of this month to inspect winter production work, understand the situation and problems of winter plowing, tree planting, well digging, and handicraft sideline production, in order to guide winter production work throughout the province. The duration is seven days to half a month.

　　山西平原组织检查组
  　检查冬季工作
  　总结典型经验推动一般
    【本报讯】山西省人民政府于本月八日，从各部门抽调干部六十人，组成十八个检查组，深入各专、县、区、村检查推动冬季工作。自九月初省府、省委扩大会议后，省级及各专、县领导机关均分别召开各种会议，传达、布置了秋冬各项工作。至十一月中旬，各地冬季工作逐渐展开。此次检查以冬季生产（包括城乡物资交流、合作社、秋征负担等）、新区土改、冬学、各级代表会为重点；其次是干部领导作风问题。其目的主要是考察各地工作布置、进展，与对方针政策的贯彻、存在的问题，以及群众有何意见和要求，并从中发现典型经验推广全面，从而加强对冬季工作的领导，为明年大生产作好准备。临行前，在统一领导、重点检查的原则下，参加检查的农业、民政、财政、教育、商业五厅与劳动局、合作总社等七个单位的干部，依据各部门不同的性质，各就有关重点检查的内容进行了充分的酝酿与准备。检查范围，计有榆次、汾阳、兴县、长治、翼城、忻县等六个专区及太原市；时间约为一个半月。在本月五日全体下乡干部动员会上，省府副主席裴丽生、王世英、省委副书记赖若愚均亲临指示，指出这次检查应根据省府、省委所规定的秋冬工作方针任务，结合当地群众的要求进行考察，并指出注意以下各点：一、各级领导在执行政策及工作转折点上的思想和群众的反映，克服一般政府干部仅从完成任务上去看问题的毛病。二、准确、全面的批判问题，了解目前工作状况，同时要联系历史、发展过程，避免只看缺点专找毛病的片面观点。三、有重点的深入进行一两个村或城乡的好坏典型调查，严格报告制度。四、从具体帮助工作中进行检查工作，态度上必须谦虚谨慎，虚心倾听干部群众的意见，反对“钦差大臣”“走马观花”的工作作风。山西日报也发表短论，建议各地要很好总结检查工作的经验，以便更好的运用这一工作方法。发挥这一工作方法的巨大作用。
    【又讯】平原省人民政府农业厅为加强冬季生产领导，特组织三人工作组，于本月一号下乡赴滑县、新乡等县，检查冬季生产工作，了解冬耕、植树、打井、手工副业生产的情况及问题，以便指导全省冬季生产工作。时间为七天至半月。
