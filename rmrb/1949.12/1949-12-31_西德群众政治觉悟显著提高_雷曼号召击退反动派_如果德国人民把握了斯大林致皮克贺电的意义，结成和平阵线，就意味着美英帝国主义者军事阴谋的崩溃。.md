　　West German Masses' Political Consciousness Significantly Raised
　  Lehmann Calls for Repelling Reactionaries
    If the German people grasp the significance of Stalin's telegram to Pieck, and form a peace front, it will mean the collapse of the US-British imperialist military conspiracy.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th] DPA, Dusseldorf dispatch: Max Reimann, Chairman of the Communist Party of Germany (West Germany), recently emphasized in a speech at a meeting of the North Rhine-Westphalia State Committee of the party: The Communist Party of Germany must organize joint action by all working men and women in West Germany, and strive to satisfy their legitimate demands and fight for a unified and democratic Germany. If the German people grasp the significance of Stalin's congratulatory telegram to Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, and Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl, and unite to form a peace front, this will mean the collapse of the US-British imperialist military conspiracy. He further pointed out: The working class and all progressive elements in West Germany are shouldering a great responsibility. Whether West Germany will be turned into a base for US-British military plans or will stand in the international peace front depends on their efforts. Finally, he put forward concrete measures to repel the reactionary forces' attack on the basic rights of the working people of West Germany.
    According to ADN: The meeting pointed out that the entire party should be strengthened on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, and that the sabotage activities of special agents in the party ranks should be eliminated; and it pointed out that the political consciousness of the masses in West Germany has been significantly improved, and the primary task of the Communist Party of Germany is to eliminate the barriers separating the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party in the three joint occupation zones of West Germany, in order to realize the unity and solidarity of all the working people in West Germany. Therefore, this meeting is an important step for the Communist Party of Germany to further strengthen the all-German front for the struggle for German unification and defense of peace.

　　西德群众政治觉悟显著提高
　  雷曼号召击退反动派
    如果德国人民把握了斯大林致皮克贺电的意义，结成和平阵线，就意味着美英帝国主义者军事阴谋的崩溃。
    【新华社北京三十日电】德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫讯：德国共产党（西德）主席雷曼，最近在该党北莱茵——威期特伐利亚州委员会举行的会议上发表演说时着重指出：德国共产党必须组织西德一切劳动男女的联合行动，并为满足他们的合法要求和争取统一民主的德国而奋斗。如果德国人民把握了斯大林致德意志民主共和国总统皮克、总理格罗提渥贺电的意义，并团结起来结成和平阵线，这就意味着美英帝国主义者军事阴谋的崩溃。他进而指出：西德工人阶级和一切进步分子正肩负着巨大的责任。将来西德究竟被变成美英军事计划的基地，还是站到国际和平阵线里来，就要看他们的努力而定。最后他提出击退反动派进攻西德劳动人民基本权利的具体办法。
    另据电通社讯：这次会议指出，应在马克思——列宁主义的基础上，加强全党，扑灭特务分子在党队伍中的破坏活动；并指出西德群众的政治觉悟，已有显著的提高，德国共产党的首要任务，为消除西德三联合占领区中隔离共产党和社会民主党的壁垒，以实现全体西德劳动人民的统一与团结。因此这次会议是德国共产党进一步加强为德国统一和保卫和平而斗争的全德阵线的重要步骤。
