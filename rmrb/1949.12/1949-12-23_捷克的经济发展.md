　　The Economic Development of Czechoslovakia
　　Just twenty-four hours before British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps announced on the radio the devaluation of the pound and the subsequent rise in bread prices, Czech President Zápotocký announced to the nation that the rationing of bread and other flour foods would be lifted on October 1st, while bread prices would remain unchanged.
　　Commenting on these two developments, the Prague newspaper *Truth Road* said: "Our republic, like Britain, is also an industrial country. But the events that have unfolded in these two countries are worth comparing and studying. We have deprived the capitalists of their source of power and, with the support of the socialist Soviet Union, are engaged in planned socialist construction. On the other hand, the British Labour government, constrained by the Marshall Plan, has forfeited its fate to American imperialists and relied on the power of the most reactionary Wall Street bosses."
　　These are two policies, two roads, two lines of social development today.
　　The Czech people heard the announcement of the abolition of rationing, which was welcomed by every family and regarded as a new and moving symbol of the growing economic strength of their country. This fully demonstrates the systematic over-achievement of the industrial production plan (101.8 percent of the plan was completed in the first nine months), and thousands of new tractors, seeders, harvesters, and other machines have been supplied to agriculture, making possible an excellent harvest, which accelerated the abolition of bread rationing.
　　The great improvement in the supply of fodder in Czechoslovakia has created favorable conditions for increasing the production of cattle and sheep. In this regard, 1949 is a turning point. The number of piglets increased by 14 percent in six months. Residents have a better supply of meat, milk, and cream. For example, cream production in July was 224,000 kilograms more than in June. Cheese production was 300,000 kilograms more than in July 1948.
　　Czechoslovakia is completing the first year of its first Five-Year Plan. This year's plan will be completed and may even be completed ahead of schedule, although some difficulties are still felt to exist. New prospects for further improving the people's living standards are broad, and the conditions for completely abolishing rationing are constantly being created.
　　From this, we cannot help but recall the many pessimistic predictions of the reactionary newspapers, which falsely claimed the inevitable economic collapse of Czechoslovakia. But the facts have mocked these so-called "prophecies."
　　How can the new achievements of the People's Democratic Czechoslovakia be explained? Minister Šlechta explained it this way in a radio broadcast: "Our country has now become a huge factory, and every worker feels that he is the master of the land and is responsible for his own assets.... We have eliminated unemployment. We are increasing the wealth of our country at an unprecedented rate. Our achievements are possible thanks to socialist economic planning and cooperation with people's democratic countries, especially the Soviet Union. We have a stable currency. Our market is full of goods, and the real value of wages is increasing."
　　These are the facts. They are also an indictment of the capitalist system, which is paralyzed in political and economic crises and disasters and plunges millions of working people into misery and suffering.

### 捷克的经济发展

　　捷克的经济发展
    正当英国财务大臣克里泼斯于广播中宣布英镑贬值，而面包价格正随之上涨的二十四小时以前，捷克问题沙蒲托基昭告全国人民面包与其他面食品的配给制将于十月一日取消，而面包价格则仍保持原状。
    布拉格真理之路报在评论这二种发展的事实时说：“我们的共和国象英国一样，同样是一个工业国。但是这两个国家所发展的事件，正是值得对照并研究的。我们已剥夺了资本家力量的来源，并且在社会主义苏联的支持下，从事了社会主义有计划的建设。但另一方面，英国工党政府因为受着马歇尔计划的牵制，而将她的命运断送于美帝国主义者，并且投靠于最反动的华尔街老板的的权力之下”。
    这是两种政策，两条道路，两条今日社会发展的路线。
    捷克人民听到了取消配给制的公告，不仅每个家庭都欢迎，并且把它看作他们国家正在成长中的经济力量的新的和动人的象征。因为这充分地表示了工业生产计划的有系统的超等成就（在今开始的九个月中，完成了计划的百分之一○一·八），几千架新的拖拉机、播种机、刈割机和其他的机件供应了农业上的需要，因此才可能有优良的收获，而加速了面包配给制的取消。
    捷克共和国对于草秣供应的巨大改进，具备了增产牛羊牲畜的有利条件。在这方面，一九四九年是一个转捩点。雏豕的数目在六个月中增加了百分之十四。居民有了更佳的肉类，乳类和奶油的供应。例如在七月间奶油的产量就较六月多了二二四、○○○公斤。而乳酪的产量较一九四八年七月多了三○○、○○○公斤。
    捷克正完成了她第一个五年计划的第一年。这一年的方案将要完成，并且还可能提前完成，尽管还感觉到存在着某些困难。更进一步地改进人民生活水准的新的前途是广阔的，使完全取消配给制的条件正在不断地创造着。
    由此，我们不禁要回想到反动报纸那许多悲观的预测，它妄言着捷克的无可避免的经济崩溃。事实却嘲笑了这些所谓“预言”。
    人民民主捷克的新的成就是如何解释的呢？斯勒许泰部长在无线电广播中这样地解释着：“我们的国家现在已经变成了一个巨大的工厂，而每个劳动者都感到他是土地的主人，并对自己的资产负责……。我们已消除了失业。我们以前所未有的速度增加我们国家的财富。我们成就的可能是由于社会主义的经济计划，并由于和人民民主国家尤其是和苏联的合作。我们有稳定的货币。我们的市场上充满了货品，而工资的实际价值正在提高着”。
    这些就是事实。也就是对于资本主义制度的控诉，即那陷于政治和经济危机与灾难中瘫痪中的，而又使千百万劳动人民陷于痛苦悲惨境的制度。
