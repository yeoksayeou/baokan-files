　　Ushering in a New Upsurge in Economic Construction
    Hundreds of Thousands of Workers in Factories and Mines in Northeast China Create Thousands of New Production Records
    [Special Dispatch from Shenyang by this Newspaper] Reporter Tian Liu reports: The movement to create new records initiated by advanced producers has now become widespread throughout Northeast China, and hundreds of thousands of workers are actively producing to welcome the new upsurge in the country's economic construction. In mid-September, advanced producers from the Third Machine Factory of the Northeast Machinery Bureau—Zhang Shangju, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhao Guoyou, a member of the Communist Youth League—created new production records of eleven hours and thirty minutes for lathe "marking" and one hour and sixteen minutes for machining "stepped pulleys," respectively. The workers of the factories under the Machinery Bureau were immediately stirred. In less than half a month, the factories formed a mass movement even more enthusiastic than the May Labor Emulation Campaign. In early October, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government studied this experience of the Machinery Bureau, believing that the class consciousness of the liberated working class in Northeast China, under the leadership and education of the Party and the People's Government, had been unprecedentedly raised, and that the time was ripe to break through old quotas, create new records, and usher in a new upsurge in economic construction. They made a decision to call on the entire working class in Northeast China to learn from Zhang Shangju and Zhao Guoyou and launch a new record movement. This call quickly received an enthusiastic response from hundreds of thousands of workers. From factories to mines, from railway transportation to commercial and trade sectors, a prairie fire of creating new production records was ignited everywhere, with new records of shortening working hours, increasing production, improving quality, and saving raw materials appearing daily.
    　　　　Increasing Production
    The CPC Fushun Municipal Committee put forward the slogan "The first battle is to fight oneself" to the mines, overcame the conservative thinking of some responsible cadres, and the movement quickly unfolded. By November 17, more than six thousand workers had created new records in more than one thousand and four types of work. The locomotive overhaul work of the Vehicle Factory in November had exceeded the puppet Manchurian standard by four times, and the output of thirty-seven major types of work had been increased by one to thirty times. The utilization coefficient of a blast furnace in Anshan has increased by more than 30% compared with the puppet Manchurian period, and the output has also increased by more than 21%. The proportion of iron used for steelmaking reached more than 88% in October, while it accounted for only 32% from 1941 to 1945 during the puppet Manchurian period.
    　　　　Improving Quality
    While increasing production, attention was also paid to improving quality. Before and in the early stages of the new record movement, the parts of machine factories could not be arbitrarily installed on the same type of machine. Now many machine factories have overcome this shortcoming. The output of the Fifth Machine Factory in November increased by nearly 75% compared with the previous month, while the reject rate decreased from 1.59% to 0.65%. Sun Qingwen, an employee of the lactic acid fermentation chamber of the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory, successfully invented the method of culturing lactic acid bacteria with chili peppers, which increased the factory's lactic acid fermentation output by 266%, and the quality also increased from 94% in the past to 98%.
    　　　　Reducing Costs
    In creating new production records, employees also paid great attention to saving raw materials and reducing costs. Chen Zhengxian, the leader of Class A of the Anshan Steel Plant, saw that the pulverized coal used in the gas generator was often blown into the air duct by wind pressure, which not only prevented the generation of gas, but also required shutdowns to clean the flue after a long period of time, which delayed production and wasted labor. He invented an iron grate welded to the coal chute under the coal-carrying hopper, so that before the coal was sent into the generator, it passed through the iron grate to leak out the pulverized coal, thus saving 25 tons of pulverized coal every day and saving 3.3 million yuan (Northeast currency, the same below) in labor costs every week. The Foundry of the Shenyang Experimental Factory created a new record of melting 18.37 tons of iron with one ton of coke, while during the puppet Manchurian period, one ton of coke only melted 13 tons of iron. Due to the efforts of the workers to save costs, the costs of many factories have been greatly reduced. The cost of each machine in the Third Machine Factory has been reduced by one-fifth. After the Benxi Coal Mine improved the tunneling method, the monthly savings in explosives and other expenses reached 360 million yuan. After the efficiency of the Hegang Coal Mine was improved, it was equivalent to increasing the country's wealth by nearly 4 billion yuan every month.
    　　　　Leading Cadres Deeply Involved in On-Site Leadership Promotes the Steady Development of the New Record Movement
    The in-depth involvement of leading cadres and technical personnel in the factories and mines to strengthen leadership, combine theory with practice, and combine science and technology with the enthusiasm of workers is one of the important factors for the steady development of the new record movement. In the early stage of the record-breaking movement, although outstanding enterprise management workers such as Comrade Xu Hongwen, deputy manager of Benxi Coal and Iron Company, emerged, most enterprise management cadres and employees still stood outside the movement because most cadres had ideas such as "not understanding production knowledge, and employees cannot create records." With the development of the movement and the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Industrial Department of the People's Government on strengthening the leadership of the new record movement, the broad masses of enterprise leading cadres and technical personnel have joined this surging torrent. The Fushun Mining Bureau put forward the slogan of "creating new records for leadership," and at the end of last month organized more than 60 technical personnel to go deep into various mines to study production problems. Cadres of each mine also went deep into the front lines to participate in and lead workers in creating new records. The deputy section chief of steelmaking and workers of the Steel Plant studied and improved technology together, and finally successfully smelted the "high-speed steel" that could not be smelted during the Japanese occupation. Zhu Wenhuan, a technician from the Electromechanical Plant, led Xu Baohe and 16 other workers to improve the operation method, creating a new record of refining a furnace of carbon steel in 1.53 minutes (it took 4 hours during the puppet Manchurian period). The mine director, secretary of the general branch of the Communist Party of China, and chairman of the trade union of the Gaode Coal Mine in Fuxin, together with the engineering section and the cadres in charge of the pithead, went deep into the mine on November 2 and conducted actual experiments based on the spirit of the Soviet layered coal mining method. As a result, the coal mining efficiency of the mine increased by 23%, and the recovery rate also increased from 50% to more than 70%. After Meng Xianke, an employee of the Personnel Department of the Automobile General Factory, went deep into the front lines to understand the situation, he solved the long-troubled problem of "form reporting and statistics." According to the actual needs, he simplified 13 types of forms into two, so that the personnel work comrades were freed from the quagmire of busy clericalism and moved the "personnel work" of making tables and statistics in the house to the workshops and the front lines to understand the workers' emotions and solve the urgent problems of the workers. The spirit of the Soviet technical personnel working in Northeast China being loyal and responsible for the cause of the Chinese people and their working style of going deep into the front lines and doing things themselves have greatly enlightened and educated our enterprise management cadres. Shi Deyang, the deputy director of the Huanggu Tun Vehicle Factory, whom we hired as a Soviet technician, not only introduced the Soviet advanced enterprise management method—assembly line operation method—to the factory, but also personally went to the front lines to guide its implementation. Under his influence, from the factory director to the employees, they all went deep into the front lines to lead and participate in the new record-creating movement. The knowledge and abilities of leading cadres and technical personnel have also been enriched and improved in this movement.
    　　　　Determining Reasonable Quotas
    Universally signing contact contracts and gradually determining reasonable quotas is a new development for further organizing and promoting the new record movement. In the new record movement, due to the unparalleled wisdom of the working class, the above-mentioned great achievements have been created, but at the same time, a series of problems that must be solved quickly have also been put forward. This is because the development of the movement is unbalanced, especially because the production organization and leadership of many factories and mines lag behind the development of the movement, resulting in phenomena of processes not being adapted to each other and not being able to cooperate. The Shenyang Woolen Mill and other factories have resolved the phenomenon that the quality of various processing procedures cannot be connected to each other and affect production by signing contact contracts between workshops, thereby significantly improving the quality and output of finished products throughout the factory. Now, all factories and mines in Northeast China are working hard in this direction to further push the movement to create new production records to a new direction of development.

　　迎接经济建设新高潮
    东北各厂矿数十万工人创造千百种生产新纪录
    【本报沈阳特讯】记者田流报道：为先进生产者所掀起的创造新纪录运动现已普及于全东北，数十万工人正为迎接祖国经济建设的新高潮而积极生产。九月中旬，东北机械局第三机器厂先进生产者——中共党员张尚举、青年团员赵国有分别创造了车床“划线”十一时三十分，车“塔轮”一时十六分的生产新纪录，机械局所属各工厂的工人立即轰动起来。不到半月时间，各厂即形成比五月立功竞赛还热烈的群众运动。十月初，中共中央东北局、东北人民政府工业部研究了机械局这个经验，认为解放了的东北工人阶级，在党与人民政府领导教育下，阶级觉悟已经空前提高，突破旧定额创造新纪录，掀起经济建设新高潮的时机已经成熟。就作了决定，号召全东北工人阶级学习张尚举、赵国有，开展新纪录运动。这一号召迅速得到数十万工人的热烈响应，从工厂到矿山，从铁路运输到商业贸易部门，到处燃起创造生产新纪录的燎原大火，缩短工时，增加产量，提高质量，节省原料的新纪录天天出现。
    　　　　增加产量
    中共抚顺市委向各矿提出“第一仗先向自己打”，克服了部分负责干部的保守思想，运动便迅速展开，到十一月十七日，已有六千余工人在一千○十四种工种上创造了新纪录，车辆厂十一月份的机车检修工作，已超过伪满标准四倍，并在三十七种主要工种上提高产量一倍至三十倍。鞍山某高炉容积利用系数已比伪满时提高百分之三十以上，产量也提高百分之二十一强，制钢用铁的比例十月份已达百分之八十八以上，而伪满时一九四一年到四五年仅占百分之三十二。
    　　　　提高质量
    与提高产量同时，并注意了提高质量。在开展新纪录运动之前和初期，机器工厂的零件，不能任意的按装在同一类型的机器上，现在有许多机器工厂已克服了这个缺点。第五机器厂十一月份较前月产量提高近百分之七十五，废品却由百分之一．五九降低到○．六五。东北化学制药一厂乳酸＠①室职工孙庆文发明以辣椒培养乳酸菌成功，提高了该厂乳酸＠①的产量达百分之二百六十六，质量也由过去的百分之九十四提高到九十八。
    　　　　降低成本
    在创造生产新纪录中，职工们也非常注意节省原料，降低成本。鞍山炼钢厂甲班班长陈正先看到煤气发生炉所用的粉煤，常常被风压吹入风道，不但不能发生煤气，日子长了还得停工扫烟道，既耽误生产又费人工；他发明了一种铁篦子焊在运煤的翻斗子下面的煤溜子上，使煤炭送入发生炉之前，经过铁篦子把粉煤漏下去，因此每天节省了二十五吨粉煤，每星期还节省人工费三百三十万元（东北币、下同）。沈阳实验工厂铸工厂创造了一吨焦炭熔化十八．三七吨铁的新纪录，伪满时一吨焦炭仅化十三吨铁。由于工友们努力节约，许多工厂的成本都大大降低了，机械三厂每台机械已降低五分之一的成本，本溪煤矿改进掘进方法后，每月节省炮药等费即达三亿六千万元；鹤岗煤矿效率提高后，每月等于增加国家财富近四十亿。
    　　　　干部深入现场领导新纪录运动稳步发展
    各厂矿领导干部和技术人员深入现场加强领导，使理论与实际结合，科学技术与工人热情结合，是新纪录运动稳步发展的重要因素之一。在创纪录运动初期，虽然曾经涌现了象本溪煤铁公司副经理徐宏文等同志那样杰出的企业管理工作者，但因多数干部存在着“不懂生产知识，职员不能创纪录”等思想，大部分企业管理干部和职员还是站在运动外面。随着运动的发展和中共中央东北局及人民政府工业部加强领导新纪录运动的指示，广大的企业领导干部和技术人员已纷纷投入这一汹涌洪流中。抚顺矿务局提出“创造领导的新纪录”的口号，于上月底组织了六十多名技术人员，分别深入各矿厂研究生产问题，各矿场干部也都深入现场参加和领导工人创造新纪录。制钢厂炼钢副股长和工人一块研究改进技术，终将日寇时不能炼好的“锋钢”冶炼成功。机电厂技师朱文汉领导徐宝和等十六名工友改善操作方法，创造了一点五十三分炼出一炉炭素钢的新纪录（伪满是四点钟）。阜新高德煤矿矿长、中共总支书记、工会主任会同工务科及坑口负责干部，于十一月二日深入矿井，根据苏联分层采煤法的精神实际试验，结果使该矿的采煤效率提高百分之二十三，回收率也由百分之五十提高到百分之七十以上。汽车总厂人事处职员孟宪科深入现场了解情况后，解决了苦恼已久的“表报统计”问题，他根据实际情况所需要，将十三种表格简化成两种，使人事工作同志从忙乱的事务主义泥坑中解脱出来，把坐在房子里造表统计的“人事工作”搬到工房、现场去，以了解工人情绪，解决职工迫切需要解决的问题。在东北工作的苏联技术人员对中国人民事业忠诚负责的精神与深入现场亲自动手的工作作风，给我企业管理干部很大的启示和教育，皇姑屯车辆厂我聘请的苏联技师史德扬副厂长不仅把苏联先进的企业管理方法——流水作业法介绍给该厂，还亲自到现场指导实行，在他影响下，该厂上自厂长下至各职员，也都深入现场领导和参加创造新纪录运动。领导干部技术人员的知识和能力也在这个运动中丰富与提高了。
    　　　　确定合理定额
    普遍订立联系合同，逐渐确定合理定额，是进一步组织和推动新纪录运动的新发展。在新纪录运动中，由于工人阶级无比的智慧，创造了上述巨大的成绩，但同时也提出了一系列必须迅速解决的问题，这就是由于运动发展的不平衡，特别是由于许多厂矿在生产组织和领导方面落后于运动的发展，因此产生了过程不相适应和不能配合的现象，沈阳毛织厂等工厂通过订立车间与车间之间的联系合同，解除了各种加工工序质量上不能相互衔接影响生产的现象，从而使全厂成品质量和产量显著提高。现东北各厂矿均正朝着这一方向努力，把创造生产新纪录运动进一步推向新的发展方向。
