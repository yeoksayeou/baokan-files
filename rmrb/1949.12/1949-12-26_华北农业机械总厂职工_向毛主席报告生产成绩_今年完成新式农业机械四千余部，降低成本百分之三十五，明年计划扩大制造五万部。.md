    Respected Chairman Mao: Under your wise leadership, we are unswervingly learning from the advanced construction experience of our Soviet elder brother. We have initially implemented a production responsibility system and gradually strengthened scientific factory management, greatly increasing our production efficiency. We have successfully completed the task for 1949. With the active efforts of all our workers over the past eight months, we have completed more than 4,000 new agricultural machines and more than 1,200 sets of tractor plow parts. The average cost has been reduced by 35%, and the average production efficiency has increased by nine times.
    Most respected Chairman Mao, we are now making new plans for expanded manufacturing. We are confident to assure you that next year we will dedicate 50,000 agricultural machines to you and the vast number of farmers with our greatest efforts. Finally, let us shout to you with extreme excitement and enthusiasm: "Chairman Mao! With your leadership, we are not afraid of anything, and any difficulties can be overcome. You are victory, you are everything."
