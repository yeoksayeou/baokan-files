　　Paying Attention to Combining with Production and Learning
    Tianjin Youth League Achieves Preliminary Results
    Closed-Doorism and Other Deviations are Gradually Being Overcome
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 19th] The Tianjin New Democratic Youth League's work in establishing the league has achieved preliminary results in the past eight months. Since the Tianjin Municipal Preparatory Committee of the Youth League began its work in April, it has universally established Youth League organizations in large enterprises, factories, and institutions and schools throughout the city, developing more than 11,300 league members. Because the work of establishing the league initially paid attention to combining with production and learning, the Youth League has played an active leading role in factories and schools. Many league members in factories have generally completed or exceeded their production plans. In schools, most league members are able to study earnestly, and their grades have generally improved, basically eliminating phenomena such as absenteeism, laxity, and lack of discipline. However, some shortcomings have also been found in the Tianjin league-building work. The main problem is the failure to implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Youth League and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on league-building work, and there is a fairly widespread tendency of closed-doorism, particularly manifested in insufficient understanding and connection with the broad masses of young people. In the organizational work of the league, some units set the conditions for joining the league too high and the procedures too complicated, which limited the requirements of the vast number of young people to join the league. For example, in the South Factory of the Central Electric Factory, league members must go through group study, individual interviews, solicit opinions from the masses, pass the party branch meeting, and be reviewed by the League Preparatory Committee before being approved by the Tianjin Work Committee of the Youth League. In addition, some units divide propaganda work and organizational work into two distinct stages, some inappropriately engage in blitz-style league-building campaigns, some believe that there are too few people to establish a league, and some units can work hard to cooperate with temporary work tasks after the league is established, but are not good at leading league members to work hard to complete the factory's regular central task—doing a good job in production. In schools, some league members have too heavy extracurricular burdens, which hinders their studies. In some government agencies, there is a thought of simply engaging in amateur activities, while ignoring the task of educating league members to be familiar with their work. These shortcomings are now being gradually improved.

　　注意和生产、学习相结合
    天津建团获初步成绩
    关门主义等偏向正逐步克服
    【新华社天津十九日电】天津市新民主主义青年团建团工作，八个月来已经获得初步成绩。青年团天津市筹委全自四月开始工作以来，在全市大企业、工厂和机关学校中普遍建立了青年团的组织，发展了团员一万一千三百多人。由于建团工作一开始就注意和生产、学习相结合，故青年团在工厂、学校中起了积极带头的作用。许多工厂中的团员，普遍完成或超过了生产计划。在学校里一般团员大都能够认真学习，成绩普遍提高，基本上消灭了旷课、散漫、无纪律等现象。但在津市建团工作中，也发现了一些缺点。主要是没有贯彻青年团中央和中共天津市委会关于建团工作的指示，相当普遍地存在着关门主义的偏向，特别表现在对广大青年群众的了解和联系不够。在团的组织工作中，有的单位把入团的条件订得太高，手续繁复，限制了广大青年入团的要求。如中央电工厂南厂，团员入团须要经过小组学习、个别谈话、征求群众意见、党的支部会通过、团筹委会审查等手续，然后才由青年团天津工作委员会批准。此外，有的单位把宣传工作和组织工作截然划分为两个阶段，有的不适当地搞突击式的建团运动，有的则认为人少不能建团，有的单位建团以后对临时性的工作任务还能努力配合，但对工厂经常的中心任务——搞好生产，则不善于领导团员去努力完成。在学校中，有些团员课外负担太重，妨碍了学习。部分机关中则存在着单纯搞业余活动的思想，而忽视了教育团员熟悉业务的任务。这些缺点现正逐步改进中。
