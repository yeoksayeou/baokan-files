Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th. In order to implement the resolutions of the Central Water Conservancy Conference, the East China Water Conservancy Department, the Pingyuan Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission held separate meetings to discuss and convey the resolutions of the Central Water Conservancy Conference. On November 29th, the East China Water Conservancy Department and the Pingyuan Water Conservancy Bureau jointly convened a water conservancy conference in Xuzhou, deciding to establish the Yi (River), Shu (River), Wen (River), and Yun (River) Management Committee to unify the solution of flooding problems in Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Pingyuan provinces. The management of the four rivers will adopt a separate governance approach. The Shu and Yi rivers will be repaired first, with the Shu River scheduled to complete water release in the summer of 1952 and the Yi River in the summer of 1951. Principle resolutions were also made for the repair projects of other lakes such as Nanyang, Dushan, and Weishan (all located at the junction of Shandong and Jiangsu provinces). The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission convened a cadre meeting on November 29th in Kaifeng to convey the resolutions of the Water Conservancy Conference. According to Zhao Mingfu, Deputy Director of the Yellow River Commission, the Central People's Government has approved the Yellow River management budget for next year and decided to undertake the Yellow River Diversion to Jiwei Project (that is, setting up a gate near the Yellow River Iron Bridge to divert the Yellow River water to the Wei River east of Xinxiang City, which can irrigate about 200,000 mu and benefit Wei River navigation). Therefore, next year's tasks are extremely arduous. He encouraged all cadres to resolutely complete the Yellow River management tasks for next year.

　　华东、平原联合召开水利会议
  　统一解决山东等省水患
    黄委会决定举办引黄济卫工程
    【新华社北京九日电】为贯彻中央水利会议的决议，华东水利部、平原省水利局及黄河水利委员会，分别召开会议，讨论和传达中央水利会议的决议。上月二十九日，华东水利部和平原水利局在徐州联合召开的水利会议上，决定成立沂（河）、沭（河）、汶（河）、运（河）治导委员会，统一解决山东、江苏、安徽、平原四省水患问题。四河治导采取分治方针，首先修治沭、沂两河，预定沭河于一九五二年夏季完成放水，沂河于一九五一年夏季完成放水。其他南阳、独山、微山等湖（均在山东、江苏二省交界处）的修治工程，亦作出原则决议。黄河水利委员会于上月二十九日在开封召开所属干部大会，传达水利会议的决议。据黄委会副主任赵明甫说：中央人民政府已批准明年治黄预算并决定举办引黄济卫工程（即在黄河铁桥附近设闸，引黄河水至新乡城东入卫河，约可灌溉二十万亩，并有利卫河航运）。故明年任务十分艰巨。他勉励全体干部，坚决完成明年治黄任务。
