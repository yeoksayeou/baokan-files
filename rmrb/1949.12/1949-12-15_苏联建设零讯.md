　　Soviet Construction Snippets
  　Inochkin's Invented Automatic Conveyor Belt for Lathes
    A newly designed automatic conveyor belt for lathes has been put into operation at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory. This lathe can automatically complete the work of chuck operators, turning operators, and grinding operators. Machine parts can be automatically transferred along the conveyor belt from one machine to another for turning, grinding, and shaping. This new type of lathe conveyor belt was designed by the Soviet inventor Inochkin, who has been working in the field of automatic machine industry for many years. The automatic conveyor belt for lathes first invented by Inochkin in 1940 at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory was not only the first in the Soviet Union, but also the first in the world. A few years later, this automatic conveyor belt began to be manufactured in many machine factories in Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, Sverdlovsk, and other places, and it also appeared abroad. Inochkin began working as an assembly worker at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory twenty years ago, when the factory was under construction and new workshops were being equipped with machines. Inochkin was responsible for installing new lathes, so he studied the structure of the lathes. In his spare time, he devoted himself to studying the latest machines. Soon he entered the factory university, where he studied mechanical theory, design, and metal processing knowledge. In these years of work and study, Inochkin began to think about inventing automatic conveyor belts to reduce the labor of workers. Currently, this talented inventor leads a design committee engaged in further automating the production of tractors.
    Safety Technology Research Offices in Soviet Industrial Enterprises
    This year, Soviet trade unions have established safety technology research offices in many enterprises, which is an important factor in the struggle for healthy and safe working conditions. Safety technology research offices are dissemination centers for large-scale publicity of industrial welfare. Every newly employed worker in the factory learns here the necessary preventive measures for his work and recognizes the safety technology machinery equipped in the enterprise. In addition to giving instructions to young workers, these research offices also train industrial welfare inspectors, who are elected by the workers themselves to constantly monitor the management's implementation of industrial welfare measures. Safety technology research offices often exhibit and supply necessary slogans and books, explaining safe working methods at workbenches in various industries, as well as books and models on these issues. Every safety technology machine or measure adopted by the factory is thoroughly studied and inspected in these research offices.
    The Newly Produced Soviet "Donbass" Combined Coal Mining Machine Has Remarkable Efficiency
    The Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry has summarized the initial achievements of using the first batch of newly produced "Donbass" combined coal mining machines. The designers of this combined coal mining machine have won the Stalin Prize. With this "Donbass" combined coal mining machine, the mechanization of the most laborious coal mining process on steep and inclined coal mining sites has been victoriously resolved on a large industrial scale. The "Donbass" combined coal mining machine is a highly efficient and versatile machine. It can simultaneously split coal and load the coal onto the conveyor. It is particularly worth mentioning that the loading mechanism of the combined machine is designed differently from all previous loading mechanisms, and it almost completely replaces the hardest labor of the loading workers. The amount of manual loading work has been reduced to a very small amount, only cleaning the coal mining site after the combined machine has worked. The new combined machine can greatly reduce the number of miners working in the coal mining site and increase the labor productivity of each worker. This machine is not difficult to master and use, and miners can quickly become proficient.

　　苏联建设零讯
  　依诺契金发明的车床自动运送带
    斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂里开动了新设计的车床自动运送带。这种车床能自动地完成旋盘工人、转削工人和研磨工人的工作。机器零件可以自动地沿着运送带由一台机器传递到另一台机器去旋切、研磨和成形。这种新式车床运送带是苏联发明家依诺契金设计的，他在自动机器工业方面已经工作了很多年了。依氏一九四○年第一次在斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂发明的车床自动运送带不仅在苏联是第一个，就是在全世界上也是第一个。几年以后，这种自动运送带便在莫斯科、列宁格勒、哈尔科夫、斯维尔德洛夫斯克等地的许多机器工厂里开始制造，并且外国也出现了。依诺契金二十年前开始在斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂里当装配工人，那时工厂正在建设中，新的车间里正在装设机器。依氏担任装置新车床的工作，于是他就研究车床的结构。有了闲工夫他就专心研究最新式的机器。不久他便进了工厂大学，在那里学习了机械理论、设计和金属工艺等知识。依氏就在这些工作和学习的年代里，开始想到要发明自动运送带，以减轻工人的劳动。目前这位才能卓著的发明家领导着一个设计委员会，从事使拖拉机之生产进一步自动化。
    苏联工业企业里的安全技术研究室
    苏联职工会今年在许多企业里设立了安全技术研究室，这在争取健康和无危险工作条件的斗争中是起着重要作用的因素。安全技术研究室是大规模宣传工业福利的传播中心。工厂每一个新雇用的职工都在这里学习他的工作中所必需的预防办法，并认识该企业中装备着安全技术机械。这些研究室除了给与青年工人指示以外，还训练着工业福利监察员，这是工人自己选出以经常监视经理部实行工业福利措施的。安全技术研究室时常展览并供应必需的标语和图书，说明各种工业里面工作台旁的无危险工作法以及关于这些问题的书籍和模型。工厂所采用的每一种安全技术机械或措施，都在这些研究室里经过详细的研究和考察。
    苏联新出“顿巴斯”式联合采煤机效能卓著
    苏联煤业部总结了第一批新出“顿巴斯”式联合采煤机使用的初步成绩。这种联合采煤机的设计者曾荣获斯大林奖金。有了这种“顿巴斯”式联合采煤机以后，在陡坡与斜坡的采煤场上最费劳力的采煤过程之机械化问题，就以巨大工业规模而获得胜利解决。“顿巴斯”式联合采煤机是一种效率极高的万能机器。它能同时劈煤并把煤装到运送机上去。特别值得提及的是：联合机的装载机械和从前有过的一切装载机械的设计都不相同，它几乎完全代替了装载工人最苦的劳动。人力装载工作的分量已减至非常微少，只是在联合机工作以后，清扫采煤场而已。新式联合机可以大大减少在采煤场工作的矿工的数目，并提高每一个工人的劳动生产率。这种机器的掌握与运用并不繁难，矿工们很快就可以熟练。
