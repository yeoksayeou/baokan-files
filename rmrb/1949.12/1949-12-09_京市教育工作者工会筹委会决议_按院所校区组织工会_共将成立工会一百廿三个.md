    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Education Workers' Union Preparatory Committee is actively carrying out its preparatory work. According to the resolution of the first meeting of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee, unions will be established in each research institute and in each university and middle school, organized by institute, school, or campus. Primary schools will establish unions by district, with each school establishing a branch union or union group. There are a total of nineteen institutions of higher education and eighty-four middle schools in the urban area, and primary schools are divided into twenty districts, resulting in a total of 123 unions to be established, with approximately 18,000 members. The number of middle schools in the suburbs is also being investigated. Based on the specific circumstances of each institution, middle school, and primary school, the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee decided to establish various working bodies under the Organization Department and the Propaganda and Education Department of the Preparatory Committee, to specifically lead and promote the union preparatory work in each institution, middle school, and primary school. Currently, in addition to the Organization and Propaganda and Education Departments promoting union organization and carrying out study, the committee for drafting the union's constitution, principles, and tasks is also collecting members' opinions and carrying out the drafting work. In addition, the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee held its second plenary meeting on the 4th of this month and elected Qian Duansheng, Wang Jinding, and Sun Shuyuan, three members of the Standing Committee, as candidates for members of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee.
