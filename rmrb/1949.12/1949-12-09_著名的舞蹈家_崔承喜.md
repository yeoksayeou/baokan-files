　　Famous Dancer - Cui Chengxi
　　By A. Kitovich, B. Bursov, Translated by Wang Jinling

　　At the reception held to welcome the famous Korean dancer Cui Chengxi back to her motherland, the poet Park Si-eun said:
　　"Korea is discussing the equal rights of men and women in law. I am proud that I also have equal rights as a woman like our Cui Chengxi."
　　We met the dancer, she and her husband, a famous literary critic An Man, invited us to their home. We also participated in the preview of the actress's first performance in Pyongyang after many years away. We also watched the performance.
　　It was a program for Soviet soldiers, and representatives of the Korean Republic and members of the Provisional People's Committee led by Kim Il-sung also watched the performance.
　　Cui Chengxi is called the great dancer of Korea. She undoubtedly is, but it is unfair to her if only say that. She is responsible for the revival of the long-declining Korean dance art, and thanks to her great talent, she has led Eastern dance into a new era.
　　Cui Chengxi was born in Seoul. Her father was a poet, and her brother was a talented prose writer. When Korea was brutally oppressed by Japan, they tried to preserve the traditions of national art.
　　At the age of fourteen, Cui Chengxi entered a dance school and studied Western dance for many years, especially Russian ballet. After she was able to master the techniques of modern dance, Cui Chengxi, who was forever loyal to the patriotic spirit of her compatriots, devoted herself to the work of determining her own future as a national actress.
　　She spent more than three years collecting the remaining elements of ancient dances in her country, and this was the basis for the sensational and extremely exquisite program of her first concert on September 20, 1933. Few people can appreciate the difficulty of these three years of intense work, and few people can appreciate how poverty followed in the dancer's footsteps, forcing her to even sell her wedding ring.
　　The day after her concert, the progressive Korean newspapers highly praised the young actress's first appearance, and they correctly saw the unconquerable spirit of Korea in her art. Obviously holding the same opinion, the Japanese resolutely persecuted Cui Chengxi. In addition, they could not forgive her for undeniably surpassing those Japanese dancers, whose programs only imitated European dances.
　　Cui Chengxi traveled to Europe and the United States from 1937 to 1939, and her successful performances in many world capitals were not only artistic successes. Her programs undoubtedly had political significance, and newspapers and magazines published moving reports. A foreign journalist said a wonderful sentence: "The Japanese have the ability to conquer Korea, but they cannot conquer Cui Chengxi."
　　When Cui Chengxi returned to Seoul at the end of 1939, the Japanese forbade her from performing national dances and wearing Korean national costumes. Therefore, she went to Beijing, supposedly to study Chinese dance.
　　In the spring of 1946, she returned to Seoul with many Koreans. The US military authorities learned of her arrival and invited her to perform in front of American officers and soldiers. Cui Chengxi replied that her plan did not allow her to accept the invitation, and she must immediately go to Pyongyang where her husband worked.
　　"What I want," she told us, "is to make my first performance in liberated Korea, and in front of those who brought true freedom to the Korean people."
　　She applied to cross the 38th parallel to North Korea, but the Americans refused to approve it. No reason could convince them.
　　Because of this, Cui Chengxi did what many of her compatriots had done: escaped from Seoul. Disguised as a peasant woman, and with her student Jin Baifeng, she took a fishing boat across the Yellow Sea to North Korea.
　　In her first concert, the dancer performed twelve dance programs, except for a Buddhist program and a Chinese program, the others were Korean folk dances. Whether in the selection of dances or in their performance, Cui Chengxi demonstrated the harmony that only a great artist can achieve. The dancer performed the tragic suffering of a young girl (Chun Xiang in prison) and the relaxed entertainment of a Korean youth (The Bridegroom in a Straw Hat) with the greatest expressiveness, vitality, and freedom of movement.
　　It would be wrong to think of Cui Chengxi as just an actress, she does not need a host, compiler, or artist. She is responsible for arranging the music and costumes herself, and each time she has a perfect sense of taste. In contrast to the modern Western dance that has long been just an empty enjoyment for the bourgeois audience, Cui Chengxi created an art that is organically combined with the art of the people and filled with truly profound thoughts. This art reached a hymn-like sublime state in the famous dance "Motherland" dedicated to the heroic guerrillas of Kim Il-sung.
　　Cui Chengxi's performance was correctly evaluated by the audience as a true national celebration of Korean art. Her student Jin Baifeng, a talented young dancer, also achieved the success he deserved.
　　As soon as Cui Chengxi arrived in Pyongyang, she published a statement in the newspaper, assuring her compatriots that she would dedicate all her strength and talent to the construction of democratic Korea.
　　The actress is faithful to her words. She has performed many times in the cities of North Korea. In addition, she leads the first dance school opened in Pyongyang.

### 著名的舞蹈家——崔承喜

　　著名的舞蹈家——崔承喜
    Ａ·基托维奇、Ｂ·布尔索夫  作  王金陵  译
    为了欢迎著名的朝鲜舞蹈家崔承喜回到她的祖国而举行的招待会上，诗人朴时恩说：
    “朝鲜正在讨论着男女在法律上的平等权。我骄傲着我也有象我们的崔承喜这样一个女人的同等权利。”
    我们认识了这位舞蹈家，她和她的丈夫，一位有名的文学批评家安曼，约我们到他们的家里去。我们也参加了这个远离多年的女演员，在平壤的第一次演出的预演。我们也看了演出。
    那是给苏军士兵的节目，同时朝鲜共和国的代表们和金日成所领导的临时人民委员会的委员们也看了这个演出。
    崔承喜被称为朝鲜的伟大的舞蹈家。她无疑是的，但是如果仅只这样说的话，那对她还是不公平的。她负了衰落已久的朝鲜舞蹈艺术的复兴的责任，由于她伟大的天才，她引导了东方的舞蹈进入了一个新纪元。
    崔承喜生在汉城。她的父亲是一个诗人，她的兄弟是一个天才散文家。当朝鲜受到日本残酷的压迫的时候，他们努力保存着民族艺术的传统。
    在崔承喜十四岁的时候，进了一个舞蹈学校，学了很多年的西洋舞蹈，尤其是俄国的巴来舞。当她能够掌握现代舞蹈的技术之后，永远忠诚于她同胞的爱国精神的崔承喜，就献身于决定她自己前途为一个民族演员的工作。
    她化费了三年以上的时间，去收集她本国的古代舞蹈存留的因素，而这个就是在一九三三年九月二十日，她第一个演奏会的，造成轰动一时的极其精美的节目的基础。很少有人能体会到这三年紧张工作的艰难，很少有人能体会到穷困怎样追踪着舞蹈家的脚步，使她甚至于不得不卖出她的结婚戒指。
    在她的演奏会的第二天，朝鲜的进步报纸都高度的赞美这个年青的女演员的初次出现，他们从她的艺术里正确地看见了朝鲜的不可征服的精神。显然抱着同样意见的日本人，就对崔承喜加以坚决的迫害。此外，他们不能饶恕她无可争辩地超过了那些日本舞蹈家，这些舞蹈家只有仅仅模仿欧洲舞蹈的节目。
    崔承喜在一九三七年到一九三九年游历了欧美，她在许多世界首都的成功演出不仅是艺术的成功而已。她的节目无疑地是有政治意义，报纸和杂志发表了动人心目的报告。一个外国新闻记者说了这么一句很妙的话：“日本人有能力征服朝鲜，但是他们不能征服崔承喜。”
    当一九三九年年底，崔承喜回到汉城的时候，日本人禁止她演出民族舞蹈和穿朝鲜的民族服。因此她到了北京，据说是去学习中国舞蹈。
    在一九四六年的春天，她和很多朝鲜人一同回到汉城，美军管当局知道了她的到来，就邀请她在美国官兵之前演出。崔承喜回答说，她的计划不允许接受这个邀请，她必须马上到她丈夫工作的地方平壤去。
    “我所要的，”她告诉我们说，“是在解放了的朝鲜，和在那些把真正的自由带给朝鲜人民的人们的面前，作我第一次的演出。”
    她申请通过第三十八纬度到北朝鲜，但是美国人拒绝批准。没有任何理由能说服他们。
    因为这样，崔承喜就做了她的许多同胞所做过的事：从汉城逃出。她化装成一个农妇，和她的学生金白峰一起，她坐了一条渔船穿过黄海到了北朝鲜。
    在她的第一个演奏会上，舞蹈家演出了十二个舞蹈节目，除了一个佛教的节目，和一个中国节目以外，其他的都是朝鲜人民的民族舞蹈。无论在舞蹈的选择上和它们的演出上，崔承喜都表现了只有一个伟大的艺术家才能够做到的和谐。一个年青姑娘的悲剧性的受难（在牢里的春香），和一个朝鲜青年的轻松的宴乐（戴草帽新郎），舞蹈家表演起来都有最大的表现力，活力和动作的自由。
    假使认为崔承喜仅只是一个演员的话，那是错误的，她用不着主持者、编制者或艺术家。她自己负责布置音乐和服装，每回都有着完美的情趣。和那种早已是只给资产阶级观众作空洞的享受的现代西方舞蹈对比起来，崔承喜创作了一种有机地跟人民的艺术结合着的，并且充满了真正深刻的思想的艺术。这艺术，在献给金日成的英勇的游击队员们的著名舞蹈“祖国”里，达到了一种赞美诗的崇高境界。
    崔承喜的演出，被观众正确地评价作朝鲜艺术的一个真正民族的庆祝会。她的学生金白峰，一个有天才的青年舞蹈家，也得到了应得的成功。
    崔承喜一到平壤，就在报纸上发表了一个声明，向她的同胞保证，她要献出她所有的力量和才能，致力于民主朝鲜的建设。
    这位女演员是忠实于她的话的。她在北朝鲜的城市里，作了许多次的演出。另外，她领导着在平壤开创的第一个舞蹈学校。
