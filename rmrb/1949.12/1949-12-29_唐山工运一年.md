　　One Year of Tangshan Labor Movement
　　By our reporter Lin Li
　　After a year of arduous struggle, the working class in Tangshan has united and organized in all aspects. Its unified leading body—the Tangshan Federation of Trade Unions—is also about to be born.

　　I. Over 80% of Workers Have Joined the Trade Union

　　This is a significant achievement made through the direct leadership and assistance of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the active efforts of all trade union workers. As of now, out of the 82,702 workers in the city, 72,870 have joined the trade union, and trade union organizations are spread throughout all public and private factories, mines, and workshops in Tangshan. The trade union enjoys high prestige among the workers.

　　II. Fully Leveraging the Creative Talents of the Working Class

　　The organizational work of the trade union began during the vigorous democratic reform movement and the great production movement. Once organized, it promoted and led the democratic movement and the production movement to move forward. In the past year's production movement, the trade union not only ensured the realization of the production plans of various public and private factories and mines, but also quickly brought production back to normal, and some even broke the highest records of previous years. For example, the steel plant's November output exceeded the factory's previous highest record by 104%. The coal miners' efficiency at Kailuan Mine reached a level unseen in the past nine years. At the Railway Factory, the number of work hours required to repair a passenger car, which used to be 1,500 before liberation, was first reduced to 380 work hours by Wu Kaiyun's team, and recently, thanks to the efforts of youth league member Liu Youqing's team, it only takes 240 work hours. At the same time, a large number of inventions and creative examples have emerged, fully demonstrating the great creative talents of the working class. According to incomplete statistics from six factories and mines, workers have modified or created as many as 113 types of machine parts and tools. Among them, the most valuable include the five-ton two-traction high-voltage suspension battery researched by German technicians at the Qixin Porcelain Factory for many years without success, which can now be mass-produced. The Railway Factory, which used to rely on foreign imports for air brake machines, can now manufacture them itself. Workers at the Hua Yi Chemical Factory successfully researched extracting gasoline from vegetable oil. In terms of saving, donating materials, and utilizing waste, all factories and mines have made significant achievements. Workers at the locomotive depot of the Railway Factory used waste materials and spare time to complete a very good "Sino-Soviet Friendship" locomotive, and they guaranteed safe operation for 120,000 kilometers. Workers at the power plant used old seven-strand connecting wires to make high-voltage lines, saving the country more than 5,000 jin of millet. Among the 460 employees of the Qixin Porcelain Factory, 25% were non-production personnel. After the workers suggested reorganization, 22,770 jin of millet were saved each month.

　　III. Labor Insurance and Welfare Have Been Greatly Improved

　　With the restoration and development of production, there have been considerable improvements in workers' labor insurance and welfare. Before liberation, the labor insurance and welfare of Tangshan workers were either nominal or, although the facilities were good, they did not serve the workers. Some even lacked ordinary barbershops, bathhouses, and clubs. More seriously, some private enterprises disregarded the lives and deaths of workers in order to seek huge profits. According to incomplete statistics from Kailuan Tangshan No. 1 Mine alone, from 1936 to this spring, 22,799 workers were injured or killed, including 281 deaths. After liberation, in February and March, the mine still experienced continuous burning and poisoning tragedies. After the trade union lodged a solemn protest with the mine owner, it immediately received support from trade unions, organizations, and schools in Tangshan, Beijing, and Tianjin. Under strong unity and powerful support, this "black kingdom" of more than 70 years bowed its head to the workers for the first time and immediately formed a mine safety inspection committee. After this struggle, safety equipment began to change, and there were very few casualties in the following eight or nine months, which was a great improvement compared to the past. In other factories and mines of the mine, the trade union first strived to realize the labor insurance stipulated in the original factory regulations. Based on the principle of resolving what should be resolved and what could be resolved, the number of clubs has increased from the original 11 to the current 20, bathhouses and barbershops have increased from 17 to 27, and libraries have increased from 3 to 9. Other facilities such as medical rooms, nurseries, and breastfeeding rooms have also increased doctors, nurses, nannies, and management personnel. In addition, the trade union has also made considerable progress in transforming and educating the management personnel of the old welfare undertakings. New labor insurance conditions are currently being drafted and discussed.

　　The nineteen cooperatives spread throughout Tangshan's major factories and mines currently have 32,174 members. They arose from the struggle against speculators. Because they not only reduced intermediate exploitation, but also stabilized prices, combated profiteers, protected the lives of employees, and stabilized production morale, they established prestige among employees. According to statistics from the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative alone, it supplied employees with goods worth more than 500 million yuan in six months. Based on a number that is regularly 4% or 5% lower than the market price, employees received more than 27 million yuan in benefits. Workers experienced the benefits of the cooperative in their actual lives, so they took most of their wages to the cooperative to exchange for goods. According to statistics from the Qixin Cement Factory Cooperative, it absorbed 64% of workers' wages in the last month. Under the enthusiastic support of the workers, the cooperative expanded from the initial seven or eight kinds of goods to the current seventy or eighty kinds, enough to supply 45% of all the goods needed by employees. The worker canteens prevalent in various factories and mines are all run by cooperatives. In the canteens of Qixin and Tangshan Mines, hundreds or even thousands of people eat every day, providing great convenience to workers who do not bring their families. Speaking of the benefits of the cooperative, Qixin workers compared their actual income in June last year with June this year. The total income in June last year could buy 117 jin of flour, while in June this year, it could buy 201 jin. How could such a vivid reality not make them grateful?

　　IV. Enthusiastic Learning Movement and Recreational Activities

　　The enthusiastic learning movement and recreational activities are one of the characteristics of the Tangshan labor movement after liberation. It enriched workers' knowledge, enlivened workers' emotions, and specifically ensured the completion of production tasks in various periods. In terms of workers' learning organizations alone, there are literacy classes, reading groups, study groups, study committees, training courses, cultural refresher schools, and employee schools. The first four are organized by the employees themselves under the leadership of the trade unions at all levels. Among them, except for the literacy class, which is aimed at illiterate workers, the rest are composed of theoretical study, technical study, and current affairs study according to the degree and willingness of the employees. Training courses and cultural refresher courses are organized by the trade unions of major factories and mines, with full-time and part-time teachers and fixed school sites. Classes are held for one or two hours before and after work every day. According to statistics from the Kailuan Mine Trade Union, there are a total of 210 learning organizations with 20,130 participants. Twenty-four training courses have been held, with 14,558 trainees. The employee school is organized by the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. Each term lasts three and a half months. After graduation, students return to their original jobs. It is a relatively standardized school. Two terms have been held, with 1,864 graduates. The third term is currently in progress. Most of the employees who have undergone training have become leaders or activists in various production links. Therefore, both public and private factories and mines are rushing to send students to school. The workers' learning enthusiasm is also reflected in their active contributions to newspapers. Seventy percent of the local manuscripts in the "Tangshan Labor Daily," sponsored by the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, are provided by workers. There are 706 workers serving as correspondents for the newspaper. Wall newspapers and blackboards published by the factories and mines themselves are almost universal in every workshop. According to incomplete statistics from the trade union, there are as many as 275 kinds. In order to adapt to the workers' writing requirements, the Railway Factory published the "Factory Worker" mimeographed newspaper. The Kailuan Mine Trade Union's "Kailuan Mine Worker" is a four-page, letterpress, five-day publication, which was launched on the first anniversary of Tangshan's liberation (December 12). Each issue is distributed with 6,000 copies, which is deeply praised by the majority of workers. Workers' recreational organizations are universal in various factories and mines. There are currently 54 organizations such as Yangko teams, singing teams, drama, national opera, Pingju opera, and film and drama clubs, with 2,439 participants. This literary and artistic army has performed 938 times. In order to promote and improve the development of literary and artistic work, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also held a literary and artistic training class, with 106 trained employees, which gave rise to the city-wide worker literary and artistic propaganda team.

　　Now, the Tangshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Tangshan Municipal Committee are planning to establish a large-scale, standardized worker refresher school to train 10,000 workers with junior high school degrees within five years. They have now recruited teachers, prepared school sites, compiled textbooks, and started classes in individual factories and mines.

　　The workers of Tangshan have been organized within a year, and the experience of trade union workers has become richer. This will be a more powerful guarantee for Tangshan's future industrial and mining production. Let us warmly welcome the birth of the Tangshan Federation of Trade Unions!

　　唐山工运一年
    本报记者  林里
    经过一年来的艰苦奋斗，唐山工人阶级已从各方面团结起来，组织起来了。它的统一领导机关——唐山市工会联合会也即将诞生。
    一、百分之八十以上工人参加了工会
    这是在中共唐山市委直接领导和帮助下，全体工会工作者积极努力的重大成绩。截止目前，全市八万二千七百零二名工人中，已有七万二千八百七十人参加了工会，工会组织遍于唐山各公私厂矿与大小作坊。工会在工人中有着高度的威信。
    二、充分发挥了工人阶级的创造才能
    工会的组织工作，开始于轰轰烈烈的民主改革运动与伟大的生产运动中。它一经组织起来，又推动和领导了民主运动与生产运动向前发展。在一年来的生产运动中，工会不仅保证了各公私厂矿的生产计划之实现，而且使生产很快走入常轨，有的还打破了历年来的最高纪录。象制钢厂十一月份产量已超过该厂以往最高纪录百分之一百零四。开滦矿的煤工效率，达到了九年来所没有的水平。铁路工厂在解放前要一千五百个工始得修妥的客车，先由吴开云组降到三百八十个工，近在青年团员刘幼卿组努力下，只用二百四十个工。同时，涌现了大批发明与创造的范例，充分表现了工人阶级伟大的创造才能，据六个厂矿不完全的统计，经工人改造或创造的机件与工具，达一百十三种之多，其中最有价值的，如启新磁厂由德国技师在此研究多年而没有成功的五吨二拉力高压悬垂电瓶，现在能够大量制造了；铁路工厂向来仰赖国外输入的风闸机，自己也可制造了；华一化学工厂工人研究从植物油中提炼汽油，结果也成功了。在节约、献纳器材与废物利用上，各厂矿均有重大成绩。铁路工厂机车场工人，利用废料与工余时间，完成一辆很好的“中苏友好”号机车，他们并保证安全行驶十二万公里。发电厂工人用旧的七股联线制成高压线，给国家节省了五千多斤小米。启新磁厂四百六十位职工中，原有百分之廿五的非生产人员，工人建议整编后，每月节省二万二千七百七十斤小米。
    三、劳动保险和福利事业大有改进
    随着生产的恢复与发展，工人的劳动保险与福利事业也有不少的改进。解放前唐山工人的劳动保险与福利事业，有的是有名无实，有的设备虽好不为工人服务，有的连普通理发室、洗澡塘、俱乐部都没有，更严重的是某些私营企业为了谋取厚利，而不顾工人死活。仅开滦唐山一矿的不完全统计，从一九三六年今春，死伤工人两万二千七百九十九名，其中死亡二百八十一人。解放后，在二、三月间，该矿仍然连续发生烧伤、中毒的惨案。经工会向矿主提出严正的抗议，立即得到唐山及京、津各厂矿工会、各机关团体、学校群起支援。在坚强团结与有力支援下，这个七十多年来的“黑色王国”，第一次向工人低头认错了，并立时组成矿井安全检查委员会。经过这次的斗争，安全设备始有转变，此后的八九个月伤亡极少，较前大有进步，该矿其他厂矿，工会首先争取原来厂章规定的劳动保险见诸实现。在应当解决而又可能解决的原则下，俱乐部已由原来的十一个增至现在的二十个，浴室、理发室各由十七个增至二十七个，图书馆由三个增至九个，其他如医疗室、托儿所、哺婴室均增加了大夫、护士、褓姆与管理人员。另外工会对旧有福利事业的管理人员的改造教育也获得不少成绩。新的劳保条件，正在草拟商讨中。
    遍及唐山各大厂矿的十九个合作社，现有社员三万二千一百七十四名。它产生于对投机商人的斗争中，因为它不仅减少了中间剥削、且平抑物价、打击奸商，保障了职工生活，稳定了生产情绪，因此在职工中建立起威信。仅据市供销社一处的统计，半年内供给职工物资合五万万八千多万元人民币，以经常低于市价百分之四或五的数目计，职工们得到两千七百多万元的好处。工人从实际生活中体验了合作社的好处，因此把工资的大部拿到合作社换东西。据启新洋灰厂合作社统计，最后一月吸收工人工资达百分之六十四。该社在工人热烈拥护下，由初办时的七、八种物资，扩大到现在的七、八十种，足够供给职工所有的物资的百分之四十五。盛行于各厂矿的工人食堂，均为合作社所举办，在启新与唐山矿的食堂里，每天有数百人乃至千人在吃饭，给不带家眷的工人以很大方便。说到合作社的好处，启新工人把去年六月和今年六月的实际收入做了对比，去年六月的全部收入，能买一百十七斤面粉，今年六月则可买到二百零一斤，这样生动的现实怎能不叫他们感激成分呢？
    四、热烈的学习运动和文娱活动
    热火朝天的学习运动与文娱活动，是解放后唐山工运的特色之一。它丰富了工人的知识，活跃了工人情绪，具体保证了各个时期生产任务的完成，单就工人的学习组织来说：有识字班、读书会、学习班、学委会、轮训班、文化补习学校、职工学校等。前四种是各级工会领导下，由职工自己所组成，其中除识字班以文盲工友为对象外，余者都是按职工程度和自愿，组成理论学习、技术学习时事学习。轮训班和文化补习学术，为各大厂矿工会主办，有专职教员和兼职教员，有固定校址，上课为每天上下工前后的一两小时。据开滦矿工会统计，学习组织共有二百一十个单位，参加人员二万零一百三十人。轮训班开过二十四期，受训人员一万四千五百五十八人。职工学校为中共唐山市委所主办，三个半月一期，毕业后回原岗位工作，是个比较正规化的学校，现已开过两期，毕业学生一千八百六十四人，第三期正在学习中。经过学习的职工绝大部分成了各个生产环节的带头人或积极分子，因此，不论公私厂矿都争先恐后的送学生入学。工人的学习热潮，也反映在给报纸积极投稿上。中共唐山市委主办的“唐山劳动日报”本市稿件的百分之七十为工人所供给。担任该报通讯员的工人有七百零六名。各厂矿自己出版的壁报、黑板报，几乎普遍于每一工作间，据工会不完全统计，有二百七十五种之多。为了适应工人的写作要求，铁路工厂出版了“机厂工人”油印报，开滦矿工会的“开滦矿工”是对开四版、铅印、五日刊，已于唐山解放一周年（十二月十二日）创刊，每期发行六千份，深得广大工人称赞。工人的文娱组织普遍于各厂矿，现有秧歌队、歌咏队、话剧、国剧、评剧、影剧社等等组织五十四个，参加人员二千四百三十九人。这支文艺大军，先后演出九百三十八次。为使文娱工作广泛开展和提高，市工联会还举办了一次文娱训练班，受训职工一百零六人，并由此产生了全市性的工人文艺宣传队。
    现在，唐山市工联和唐山市委，拟创办大规模的正规化的工人补习学校，在五年内培养一万名具有初中程度的工人知识分子，现已招聘教员，筹备校址，搜编课本，并在个别厂矿开学了。
    唐山工人在一年内组织起来了，工会工作者的经验更加丰富了，这对唐山今后工矿生产，将是一个更有力的保障，让我们热烈迎接唐山工联的诞生吧！
