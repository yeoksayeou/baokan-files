　　Dalian Far East Electric Company's Mechanical and Glass Factories
    Correcting the Tendency of Too Many Meetings and Concurrent Positions
    [Our Newspaper] The glass factory and metal machinery factory affiliated with Dalian Far East Electric Company have now begun to correct the tendency of "too many daily meetings and too many concurrent positions for cadres." The glass factory used to have many meetings, sometimes holding several meetings at the same time; Party group meetings and branch meetings were held every week. The first branch secretary of the factory said: "Without new work arrangements, everyone feels there is nothing to talk about when holding a group meeting every week." After research by the factory, a meeting system has now been re-established, with an average of only one meeting per day (excluding all factory workers), and ensuring that the dates of various meetings do not conflict, with each meeting lasting no more than two hours. This system has been implemented since this month. For example, Party group meetings have been changed to twice a month, each lasting no more than 30 minutes; the trade union executive committee meets on the 30th of each month; trade union group meetings are held every two weeks, with meeting times not exceeding 30 minutes; the Communist Youth League branch general meeting and branch committee each meet once a month; the women workers' department holds a meeting every two weeks; and the factory affairs meeting is held once a week. Regarding cadres holding concurrent positions, Xu Ruijiang, an old worker who used to hold eight positions concurrently, has resigned from his duties as director of the Friendship Association branch and leader of the study group. He now concurrently holds positions such as vice chairman of the trade union, safety committee member, gas minister, and organization committee member of the Party general branch, and is training other workers to serve as safety committee members in the future. Ma Jinbang, secretary of the personnel section, has also resigned from his position as director of the branch, which is now held concurrently by the first Party branch secretary, and is currently preparing to train other workers to take on the role.
    The metal machinery factory, being a newly built factory, had leading cadres completely assigning some responsibilities to a few active workers. For example, Sui Shuxue, the director of the trade union, held more than five positions concurrently; other committee members also held multiple responsibilities. The trade union director was busy with meetings all day long and did not understand the actual situation of the various branches under him, and did not even have time to study, not being able to return home until 9 or 10 o'clock every night. Sometimes there were too many meetings, and many cadres did not know where to go to attend them. In response to the above situation, the trade union re-elected new cadres, who began working at the end of October. The trade union director has completely resigned from Party and Youth League work and is now solely responsible for trade union work; cultural and educational work is handled concurrently by the women workers' department, with a cultural and educational officer below; and the production committee is the responsibility of the machinery workshop director.

### 大连远东电业公司机械玻璃两厂  纠正会议多兼职多偏向

　　大连远东电业公司机械玻璃两厂
    纠正会议多兼职多偏向
    【本报讯】大连远东电业公司所属玻璃工厂及金属机械工厂现已开始纠正“日常会议多，干部兼职多”的偏向。玻璃工厂过去会议很多，有时在同一个时间内，就要开好几个会；党小组会和支部会每星期都要召开一次。该厂第一支部书记说：“没有新的工作布置，每星期开一次小组会时，大家都感觉没有什么谈的。”经该厂研究后现已重订出会议制度，平均每天只开一次会（不包括全厂工友），并使各种会议召开日期不冲突，每次时间不超过两小时，此一制度已于本月开始执行。如党小组会改为一月两次，每次不超过三十分钟；工会执行委员会每月三十日召开；工会小组会两周一次，开会时间不超过三十分钟；团支部大会与团支委会，每月各召开一次；女工部每两周召开一次会；厂务会议每周召开一次等。在干部兼职方面，过去身兼八职的徐瑞江老工友，已辞退友协分会主任、学习组长的职责，现共兼工会副主席、安全委员、瓦斯部长、党总支组织委员等职，并正在培养其他工友将来担任安全委员。人事科秘书马进榜亦辞掉支会主任的职务，该职现由党第一支书兼任，最近已准备培养其他工友担任。
    金属机械工厂因是个新修建的厂子，领导干部把一些职责完全叫几个积极工友来担当。如该工会主任随树学，兼五职以上；其他委员也多兼任其他职责。工会主任整天忙于开会，所属各支会的实际情况则一点也不了解，自己连学习时间都没有，每天晚上九、十点钟才能回家。有时会多了，许多干部不知到那里去开好。针对以上情况，工会重新提拔了新干部，于十月末开始工作。工会主任已将党内工作与团的工作完全辞掉，专负责工会工作；文教工作由女工部兼任，下面设有文教干事；生产委员由机械职场长负责。
