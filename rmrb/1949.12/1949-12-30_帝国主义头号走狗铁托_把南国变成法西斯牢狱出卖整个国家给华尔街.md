　　Xinhua News Agency, Luojing Dispatch: Imperialism's Number One Running Dog Tito
    Turns Yugoslavia into a Fascist Prison and Sells the Entire Country to Wall Street
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 28th] According to a Bucharest dispatch from the Electric News Agency: Imperialism's number one running dog Tito and his secret police clique are not only turning Yugoslavia into a large fascist prison, but are also turning it into a colony of the United States.
    Tito begged Wall Street tycoons for loans. The first loan was quickly used up, and new debts forced him to beg for a second loan, selling the entire country to Wall Street. In order to repay the first dollar loan, Tito agreed to compensate the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland and other countries for nationalized assets, and agreed to repay the debts of Yugoslav quisling elements. These figures totaled 100 million US dollars, which is equivalent to five times the loan obtained from the United States. At the same time, the entire industry is being handed over to foreign capitalists, and some mines have already been exploited by American capitalists.
    The Tito clique is making Yugoslavia's exports suitable for American requirements. Before the war, only 4.5 percent of Yugoslavia's total exports went to the United States, totaling 3.8 million US dollars annually. But now Yugoslavia exports copper worth 3.6 million US dollars to the United States every two months. In the first five months of this year, the total value of metals exported from Yugoslavia to the United States has reached 10 million US dollars. The United States exports large quantities of milk powder, sewing machines and other manufactured goods to Yugoslavia, resulting in a trade deficit of 5 million US dollars in Yugoslavia within six months, and the debt is accumulating more and more.
    The imperialists not only regard Yugoslavia as a cheap base for supplying strategic raw materials such as copper, tin and bauxite, but also as a cheap food producing area. The Tito clique exports corn at four dinars (Yugoslav currency unit) per kilogram, while Yugoslav workers have to pay 40 dinars to buy one kilogram of corn. Yugoslav-produced sugar, which can be bought for 5.5 dinars in Italy, costs Yugoslav workers 300 dinars to buy. Tito has further hired British and American "experts" to control the raw material industry, completely turning Yugoslavia into a colony of the "Marshall Plan." The Tito clique has abandoned all the achievements of the People's Democratic Republic that the Yugoslav people fought for with great sacrifice. But the Yugoslav people, under the leadership of the working class, will regain what they have lost.

### 帝国主义头号走狗铁托  把南国变成法西斯牢狱出卖整个国家给华尔街

　　帝国主义头号走狗铁托
    把南国变成法西斯牢狱出卖整个国家给华尔街
    【新华社北京二十八日电】据电通社布加勒斯特讯：帝国主义头号走狗铁托及其秘密警察集团，不仅正在把南斯拉夫变成法西斯的大牢狱，并且正在把它变成美国的殖民地。
    铁托向华尔街的大亨乞求贷款。头一笔贷款很快地用光了，新的债务迫使他乞求第二次贷款，把整个国家出卖给华尔街。为了报答第一笔美元贷款，铁托同意向美、英、法、比、瑞典、瑞士等国赔偿国有化的资产，并同意偿付南斯拉夫吉斯林分子的债务。这些数字合计一亿美元，即相当于从美国所获贷款的五倍，同时，全部工业正在交给外国资本家，某些矿山已由美国资本家开采。
    铁托集团正使南斯拉夫出口，适合美国的要求。在战前，南斯拉夫全部出口中，仅有百分之四点五输往美国，每年总数为三百八十万美元。但现在南斯拉夫每两个月即以价值三百六十万美元的铜输往美国。今年头五个月中，南斯拉夫输往美国的金属总值，已达一千万美元。美国则向南斯拉夫大量输出奶粉、缝衣机等各种制成品，结果使南斯拉夫在六个月内达到五百万美元的贸易逆差，债务愈积愈多。
    帝国主义者不仅把南斯拉夫当作供给战略原料铜、锡和铁矾土的廉价基地，并且也把它当作廉价的粮食出产地。铁托集团以每公斤四个第纳尔（南货币单位）输出玉蜀黍，而南斯拉夫的工人却要以四十第纳尔去买一公斤玉蜀黍。在意大利可以用五点五第纳尔买到的南斯拉夫出产的糖，南国工人却要花三百第纳尔才能买到。铁托已进一步雇用了英美“专家”，控制原料工业，把南斯拉夫完全变成“马歇尔计划”的殖民地。铁托集团抛掉南斯拉夫人民以巨大牺牲奋斗得来的人民民主国家的一切成就。但南斯拉夫人民将在工人阶级的领导下，重新获得其所失去的东西。
