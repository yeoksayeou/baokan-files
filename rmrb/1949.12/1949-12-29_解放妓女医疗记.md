　　Medical Record of Liberated Prostitutes
    Lü Zhenmin
    The newspaper called on the city's medical staff to participate in the treatment of "liberated prostitutes." All twenty-five nurses in our Xian Nong Tan Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Hospital automatically signed up to participate in this work. On the same day, we immediately organized ourselves, elected one person as secretary, responsible for group affairs, liaison, compilation of reports, and other work. In order not to hinder the normal work of the hospital, the remaining twenty-four people were divided into eight groups, with three people in each group, rotating daily until their treatment work was completed.
    On the morning of November 28th, Dr. Chen Yuwu – a female doctor in our hospital – led the three of us in the second group, carrying a small X-ray machine, to "Hanjiatan." "Hanjiatan" has completely changed its appearance. Yesterday, this was still a living hell that ravaged women; today it has become the "Women's Production and Education Center."
    A comrade dressed in a gray cloth military uniform explained to us the process of liberating the prostitutes this time, and then led us to visit the dormitory of the education center.
    A plain, young woman, about twenty years old, looked at us with curious eyes. We all gathered around her and asked about her background. At first, she was embarrassed and reluctant to speak. After we explained that we were from the hospital and had come to treat them, she hesitantly said: "I am a country person from Jilin in the Northeast. My mother died when I was eighteen. In the year Japan surrendered, my father took me and my two younger sisters to farm our own three *tian* (Note: a unit of land calculation in the Northeast, ten *mu* is one *tian*), and we lived a good life. When the 'KMT calamity army' came, they said my brother was a 'Eighth Route Army' soldier, arrested my father and wanted to bury him alive. Later, they gave me to a 'battalion commander' of the 'calamity army' as his fourth concubine in exchange for my father's life. In the summer of the year before last, the 'battalion commander' said he would take me to Taiwan, but he tricked me to Beijing and押到(Yadao) me into a 'brothel', and he took the money and ran away. Now I don't even know what my home looks like!"
    "Your home has long been liberated, and this time you can go home," the comrade who led us comforted her.
    "I don't know how my father and younger sisters are looking forward to me! I have to go home quickly," she said with a strong Northeastern accent, her eyes full of infinite expectations.
    Another woman, about thirty years old, named Tian Ying said: "My husband used to be a middle school teacher in Beijing. In 1941, he was arrested by the Japanese devils, who said he was an anti-Japanese element. Later, he died in the Japanese military police station. They arrested me, raped me, and sold me here. It has been eight years now! When I first came, I was still young and could earn money for the madam. Now the madam thinks I am old and can't earn money, so I am beaten and scolded all day long, suffering alive!" As she spoke, she frowned as if she had infinite resentment. She looked like someone who had been educated. We felt very indignant at their encounters. For a moment, we didn't know what to say to comfort them. She continued excitedly, "I have suffered for eight years, tasted all the hardships of the world. Now I thank the Communist Party for rescuing us from the pit of fire, and from now on we will also stand up! I have been educated before, went to junior high school. In the future, I will start a new life in the new society!"
    A girl stood under the window to the south, staring at us blankly, looking no more than seventeen or eighteen years old. Her thin body and pale face showed that she was an immature child who had been haggard by excessive early abuse. We all surrounded her and asked her why she came here at such a young age. When she saw us, she seemed to have seen relatives. Her little eyes turned red and she said: "My father is a railway worker in Taiyuan. The year before last, he was caught by Yan Xishan to be a soldier. My mother took me and a younger brother, and we didn't even have food to eat. Later, I asked my uncle to take me to Beijing. When I was sold here, I was only fifteen years old. The old madam thought I was too young and didn't want me. Later, my uncle begged her bitterly and reduced the price by half, from two *shi* of old corn to one *shi*, before she took me in. They all called me 'Poor Thing.' Because I was too young, I trembled all over when I saw a man." She sobbed, like a child who had been bullied outside and came home to see her mother with grief. While sobbing, she continued, "Because I couldn't earn money, both the big teapot and the small teapot bullied me, beat me and scolded me all day long. In winter, they stripped me naked and poured cold water on me. I knelt on the ground, and the old madam lay in bed smoking opium, using a red-hot opium needle to pierce my arms...." As she spoke, she rolled up her sleeves, revealing strips of purple scars on her thin arms. Looking at the scars on her little arms, an indescribable hatred stung my heart. Looking back at Qiu Baorui, who came with me, her eyes were already red.
    At ten o'clock in the morning, we began to examine their bodies. Looking at their pale and haggard faces, the thin and weak bodies with sinful diseases, this was a sign of the cruelty of their past abuses. We had infinite hatred, hatred for that murderous, barbaric feudal society! This hatred turned into infinite power! From ten o'clock in the morning to six o'clock in the afternoon, we did not eat or rest. We seemed to forget everything and insisted on working for eight hours. In the twilight, we left them. As soon as we walked out of the gate, their singing came from behind: "...The democratic government loves the people! The Communist Party's kindness is endless..." It was sung so loudly!
    Lying in bed at night, those pale and haggard faces, and the strips of scars on the "Poor Thing's" arms, appeared before my eyes again. I hate the ugliness of the old society's oppression of women, but I also think that today the Communist Party has come, liberating all the people, and also liberating women, and I am also delighted and encouraged.

　　解放妓女医疗记
    吕振珉
    报纸上号召本市的医疗工作人员，参加“解放妓女”的治疗工作。我们先农坛结核病防治院一共有二十五个护士，全体自动报名参加这一工作。当天我们马上组织起来，选出干事一人；负责组务、连络、汇编报告等工作。为了不妨碍医院里的正常工作，其余二十四个人，共分编成八个小组；每组三个人，按日轮流出动，一直把她们的治疗工作作完。
    十一月二十八日早晨，由陈玉梧大夫——我们医院里的女医生，领着我们第二组的三个人，带着小型Ｘ光机，到“韩家潭”去。“韩家潭”已经面目全变了，昨天这里还是蹂躏妇女的活地狱；今天已经变成“妇女生产教养院”了。
    一位身穿灰布军装的同志，他向我们讲解了这次解放妓女的经过以后，便领我们到教养院的宿舍去参观。
    一个约摸有二十多岁的朴实的年青妇女，用好奇的眼光瞧着我们。我们都凑到她身边问她的身世，最初她还不好意思，不肯开口。经过我们说明我们是医院里的人，是来给她们治病的，她才吞吞吐吐的说：“我是东北吉林的乡下人，十八岁那年妈就死了，日本投降那年爸爸带我和两个小妹妹，种着自己的三天（按：东北计算土地的单位，十亩为一天）多地，日子过的挺好。赶到‘括民党遭殃军’来嘞，说我哥哥是‘八路’，把爸爸抓去要活埋，后来把我送给了‘遭殃军’的一个‘营长’做第四房姨太太，才换回了爸爸的老命。前年夏天‘营长’说带我去台湾，那知道他把我骗到北京，押到“窑子”里，他自个儿拿钱跑了，现在我的家也不知道啥样了！”
    “你的家早就解放了，这回就可以让你回家了。”领着我们来的同志在安慰她。
    “我爸爸和小妹妹不知怎么盼我了！我得赶快回家。”带着满口的东北乡音，眼睛里充满着无限的期望。
    另一个大约有三十多岁叫田英的说：“我丈夫从前在北京是中学教员，在一九四一年被日本鬼子抓去了，说他是抗日分子，后来死在日本宪兵队里。他们把我抓去强奸后，卖到这里来。到现在已经整整八年了！初来时我还年青，能替领家赚钱，现在领家嫌我老了，赚不来钱，更加成天挨打受骂，遭活罪！”说着她皱起眉头象有无限的愤恨。看样子她象是念过书的人。我们对她们的遭遇，感到非常愤慨。一时竟不知道说什么来安慰她们好。她继续激动地说：“我饱受了八年的罪，尝尽了人间的辛酸，现在感谢共产党把我们救出了火坑，从此我们也翻身了！过去我也受过教育，上过初中，今后我要在新社会上重新做人！”
    南面窗下站着一个女孩，呆呆的瞧着我们，看样子顶多只十七八岁。瘦小的身体和苍白的面孔，一看就知道是一个尚未发育成熟的孩子，因早期受过分的摧残而憔悴了。我们都围起她，问她为什么这么小的年纪就到这里来。她见了我们象见了亲人似的，小眼圈一红说：“爸爸是太原的铁路工人，前年给阎锡山抓去当兵，妈妈带我和一个小弟弟，连饭都没得吃，后来托叔叔把我带到北京。卖到这里的时候，我才十五岁，老鸨儿嫌我小，不要我。后来叔叔苦苦的哀求她，又减价一半，由两石老玉米减到一石，才把我收下，他们都叫我‘小可怜儿’。因为我太小，我一见到男人就吓的我混身发抖。”她呜咽起来，象一个在外边受了欺侮的孩子，回家见到了妈妈似的悲痛。她一边抽泣，一边又接着说下去：“因为我赚不到钱，大茶壶、小茶壶都欺侮我，成天打我骂我，冬天剥光了我的衣服向我身上浇凉水。我跪在地下，老鸨儿躺在床上抽鸦片烟，拿烧红的烟签子穿我的胳膊……。”说着她挽起衣袖，在寻枯瘦的小胳膊上，露出一条条紫色的疤痕。看了她那小胳膊上的疤痕，一种说不出来的愤恨在刺痛我的心，回头看我身后站着和我同来的裘宝瑞，她的两只眼圈已经红了。
    上午十点钟我们开始为她们检查身体，看着她们那一个个苍白而憔悴的面孔，瘦削而孱弱的身体上带着罪恶的疾病，这正标志着她们过去被蹂躏的惨酷。我们有无限的愤恨，愤恨那刹人的、野蛮的封建社会！这愤恨化成了无穷的力量！从上午十点钟到下午六点钟，我们没有吃饭，也没有休息，我们好象忘记了一切，坚持了八小时工作。黄昏里我们离开了她们，刚走出大门，后面送出来她们的歌声：“……民主政府爱人民哪！共产党的恩情说不完哪……”唱得那么响亮！
    夜里躺在床上，那一个个苍白而憔悴的面孔，那“小可怜儿”胳膊上一条条的疤痕，又都出现在我的眼前。我恨这些旧社会压迫妇女的丑恶，但是我又想到今天共产党来了，解放了全体人民，也解放了妇女，我又欢欣鼓舞了。
