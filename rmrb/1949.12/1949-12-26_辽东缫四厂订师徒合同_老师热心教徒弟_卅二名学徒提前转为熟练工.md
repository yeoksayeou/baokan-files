　　Liaodong Silk Reeling Factory No. 4 Signs Apprenticeship Contracts
　  Teachers Enthusiastically Teach Apprentices
　  Thirty-Two Apprentices Promoted to Skilled Workers Ahead of Schedule
    [Our Newspaper Northeast Dispatch] As one of the good ways to promote technical education, the Liaodong Provincial State-Operated Silk Reeling Factory No. 4 signed apprenticeship contracts at the beginning of the month, which resulted in thirty-two apprentices being approved for promotion to skilled workers ahead of schedule, and a significant increase in the quantity and quality of products. According to statistics, in November, the average daily output of 273 apprentices in the factory was 1,644 units. After the signing of apprenticeship contracts this month, statistics from four days (3rd to 6th) showed that the average daily output had increased to 1,871 units. In terms of quality, the percentage of standard finished products increased from 96.6% in November to 97.1%.
    When the apprenticeship contracts were initially being discussed, most skilled workers were unwilling to become teachers. Some felt that children were difficult to teach; some were afraid that apprentices would figure out their secrets and criticize them; some individuals were afraid that after teaching them well, they would "lose their edge"; some were afraid that the contract period was too short and they wouldn't be able to teach them. These concerns have been eliminated through persuasion and education. As Teacher Yao of Workshop No. 1 said, "Teaching apprentices well not only earns awards, but also brings honor." He said, "If I teach the apprentices well, I might even be selected as a model teacher." After the teachers' thinking changed, they adopted a serious and responsible attitude towards the education of apprentices. Some not only provided apprentices with technical guidance at any time, but also organized advanced model apprentices to be "little teachers" to educate those who were progressing slower. For example, Lu Xiuying of Workshop No. 1 did not produce products up to standard. Model apprentice Ma Guirong used the method of demonstrating to her, which quickly improved Lu Xiuying's skills.
    Due to the signing of apprenticeship contracts, the relationship between teachers and apprentices has become more united. Some apprentices automatically reported their work achievements and shortcomings to their teachers every night, requesting timely guidance. Among the 273 apprentices in the factory, the phenomenon of not following factory rules and not obeying teachers' guidance has now been completely eliminated.
    The factory leadership, in view of the remarkable achievements made by the technicians in educating apprentices throughout the factory, and the resulting increase in the quantity and quality of products, has rewarded the technicians in accordance with the provisions of the apprenticeship contracts.

### 辽东缫四厂订师徒合同　老师热心教徒弟　卅二名学徒提前转为熟练工

　　辽东缫四厂订师徒合同
　  老师热心教徒弟
　  卅二名学徒提前转为熟练工
    【本报讯东北讯】作为推广技术教育的良好方式之一，辽东省省营缫丝第四厂于月初订立了师徒合同，并因此使三十二名学徒提前被批准转为熟练工人，而产品的数量与质量亦有显著提高。据统计，十一月份全厂二百七十三名学徒，平均日产量为一千六百四十四条，本月订立师徒合同后，四天（三至六日）统计，平均每天产量已提高到一千八百七十一条。在质量方面，则由十一月标准成品的百分之九十六点六，提高到百分之九十七点一。
    当酝酿师徒合同订立之初，一般技术工人不愿当老师。有的觉得小孩子不好教；有的怕学徒摸透了自己的底细，批评自己；个别的则怕教好乖之后，自己“吃不开”了；有的怕合同时间短，教不会。这些顾虑经过说服教育，已被消除。如一号车间姚老师说：“教好徒弟不但得奖，还光荣呢。”他说：“要把徒弟教好，还许选咱当个模范老师呢。”老师的思想转变之后，对徒弟的教育采取了严肃负责的态度。有的不仅随时予学徒以技术指导，并组织进步快的模范学徒当小先生，教育进步慢的。如一号车间卢秀英，产品不合标准，模范学徒马桂容就用做出样子给她看的方式，使卢秀英的技术很快提高。
    由于师徒合同的订立，师徒关系益趋团结。有的学徒每晚自动向老师报告工作成绩和缺点，要求及时指导。在全厂二百七十三名学徒中，现已根本消灭了不守厂规和不服从老师指导的现象。
    该厂领导上鉴于全厂技工在教育学徒上所达到的可观成绩，以及因此而提高了产品的数量与质量，已根据师徒合同的规定，给予技工以奖励。
