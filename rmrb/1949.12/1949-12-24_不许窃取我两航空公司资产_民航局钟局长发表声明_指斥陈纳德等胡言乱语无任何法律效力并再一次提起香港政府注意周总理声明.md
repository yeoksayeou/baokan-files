Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23rd: Zhong Chibing, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of our Central People's Government, recently issued a statement regarding the attempt by Chennault and Willauer to illegally seize the property of our China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, as follows: According to news from Hong Kong, the Kuomintang remnant bandits are attempting to illegally sell the assets of our China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation to Americans Chennault and Willauer; Chen and Willauer have, based on this, requested the Hong Kong government to seize and transport away the assets of our two companies in Hong Kong. Premier Zhou of our Central People's Government's Government Administration Council already solemnly declared on December 3rd: "The China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation belong to our Central People's Government and are under the direct jurisdiction of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Central People's Government. Only our Central People's Government and those personnel entrusted by our Central People's Government have the right to dispose of the assets of the two airlines remaining in Hong Kong, and no one is allowed to infringe upon, move, or damage them by any means whatsoever"; the Kuomintang remnant bandits' attempt to sell these assets and the nonsense of Chennault and Willauer clearly have no legal effect whatsoever. Article 9, Section 2 of the CNAC contract stipulates that CNAC shares may not be transferred to private individuals, which shows that the collusion between the Kuomintang remnant bandits and Chennault and Willauer is a private deal and has no basis whatsoever.

Premier Zhou has previously pointed out: "If the assets of the two airlines remaining in Hong Kong are illegally infringed upon, moved, or damaged, the Hong Kong government must bear full responsibility and corresponding consequences will result." Because Chennault and Willauer are attempting to illegally infringe upon and move the assets of our two airlines remaining in Hong Kong, we once again remind the Hong Kong government to pay attention to this statement.

　　不许窃取我两航空公司资产
    民航局钟局长发表声明
    指斥陈纳德等胡言乱语无任何法律效力并再一次提起香港政府注意周总理声明
    【新华社北京二十三日电】我中央人民政府民航局钟赤兵局长顷就陈纳德、魏劳尔企图非法侵占我中央、中国两航空公司财产事发表声明如下：据香港消息，国民党残余匪帮，企图将我中国航空公司和中央航空公司的产业非法盗卖与美籍陈纳德、魏劳尔；陈、魏二人已据此向香港政府要求窃取并运走我两公司在香港的资产。我中央人民政府政务院周总理早在十二月三日即已郑重声明：“中国航空公司中央航空公司为我中央人民政府所有，受中央人民政府民航局直接管辖。两航空公司留在香港的资财，只有我中央人民政府和我中央人民政府所委托的人员，才有权处置，决不容许任何人以任何手段侵犯、移动或损害”；国民党残余匪帮的这种盗卖企图与陈纳德、魏劳尔的胡言乱语，显然没有任何法律效力。中航合同第九章第二节规定，中航股权不得让与私人，足见国民党残余匪帮与孙纳德、魏劳尔的勾结是私相授受，毫无根据。
    我周总理前已指出：“如两航空公司留港资产，有被非法侵犯，移动或损坏情事，则香港政府必须负完全责任，并将引起相应的后果”。由于陈纳德、魏劳尔企图非法侵犯与移动我两航空公司留港资产，我们再一次提起香港政府对于这一声明的注意。
