　　Improving Technology Enhances Product Quality
　  Gaoyang and Handan Cotton Textile Industries Expand Sales
    Factories Actively Increasing Production
    [Our Newspaper] The well-known cotton textile industries of Gaoyang and Handan in Hebei Province, with the assistance of local economic departments and the government, have improved the quality of their finished products through inspecting finished goods, improving technology, and standardizing quality standards. Sales have gradually expanded, enabling the development of the cotton textile industries in these two regions.

    The weaving industry in Gaoyang and Handan has a considerable foundation. In the past, its products were sold in Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and other places, and were very popular among local people. Since the liberation of major cities such as Beijing and Tianjin, the market has shrunk slightly due to the sale of imported yarn throughout Hebei; however, the main reason is that the production of the weaving industry in these two places has inconsistent connections, with varying qualities and types. Also, some weaving businesses lowered the quality of their cloth in pursuit of profits, which affected the sales of finished products.

    In order to help the cotton weaving households solve this difficulty, the Handan Town government and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce successively held three symposiums for managers, technicians, and workers in September to study how to improve product quality. The evaluation standards for cloth were immediately stipulated, and it was pointed out that the product quality of the private Yong Sheng Factory was good. Its characteristics are neat edges, flat surfaces, and bright colors. In particular, the golden-striped cloth produced by the factory has a particularly bright color, which is deeply loved by buyers. After deliberation, it was called on everyone to learn from Yong Sheng Factory. Standards for size and density were also stipulated at the meeting. Various factories fully exchanged experience in dyeing methods, the quantity and process of color usage, and techniques such as surface flatness and edge alignment, which generally and significantly improved cotton weaving technology in various factories. The Gaoyang County government also held a meeting of weaving households in the city at the same time, uniformly stipulating cloth standards. White cloth and colored cloth were divided into numbers, specifying the number of warp and weft threads, width, length, size, and weight. The County Economic Committee also proposed to the public sector to carefully check the quality when purchasing cloth, prioritize the purchase of products that meet the standards, and maintain a certain profit for the weaving households. In order to maintain the credibility of colored cloth, it was also proposed to the dyeing households that colors and soap colors should be strictly separated, and soap colors should not be used to imitate colors. After this rectification, Gaoyang cloth has made achievements in improving quality. Of the 4,000 bolts of white cloth inspected in the market, 70% have reached the standard for whole bolts. In the past, printed cloth used product colors and oil colors, and the colors were not durable. After research, steaming and printing (using chemical agents and direct color preparation) is now used, which greatly improves the quality of the cloth.

    As the quality of the cloth improves, the sales problem is also solved. At present, more than 7,000 bolts of cloth are sold in Gaoyang Chengguan District every market day, with more than 70% being sold. Sales in Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and other places are also very smooth. Handan Town has also increased from selling just over 1,300 bolts per month in September to selling over 2,100 bolts per month. All factories are now planning to expand their business. The Jincheng Factory in the town has increased from three machines to eight, and the Hengtai Factory recently shipped new electric machines back from Tianjin, planning to expand production. The cotton textile industry in the town is now showing a new look.

### 改进技术提高产品质量　高阳邯郸棉织业打开销路  各厂正积极扩大生产

　　改进技术提高产品质量
　  高阳邯郸棉织业打开销路
    各厂正积极扩大生产
    【本报讯】著名的河北高阳、邯郸等地的棉织工业，在当地经济部门与政府的帮助下，经过检查成品、改良技术、统一规定质量标准后，成品质量已较前提高，销路逐渐扩大，使该两地的棉织工业获得发展。
    高阳、邯郸等地织布业，向有相当基础，过去产品行销于张垣、石家庄、太原等地，很受当地群众欢迎。自京、津等大城市解放后，因洋纱行销河北各地，市场略有缩小；但主要原因是该两地织布业生产互有联系，质量种类不一，与某些织布业户，为了追求利润，布质降低，因此影响到成品销路。
    邯郸镇政府及工商局，为了帮助各棉织户解决这一困难，于九月间先后召开了三次经理、技师、工人座谈会，研究提高产品质量。当即规定了布匹的评选标准，并指出私营永胜工厂的产品质量好。特点是边齐、面平、色鲜，尤其是该厂出品的金黄条布，颜色特别鲜艳，深得买者喜爱。经评议后便号召大家向永胜厂学习。在会议上还规定了尺度与密度的标准。各厂在染色方法与用色数量及过程以及面平、边齐等技术方面，均充分的交换了经验，因而各厂棉织技术普遍显著提高。高阳县政府亦同时召开了城内织布户会议，统一规定布匹标准。白布、色布都分出了号数，定出经纬线数和宽长和尺码重量等。该县经济委员会同时向公营部门提出在收布时认真检查质量，对符合标准的尽先收买，并保持织布户的一定利润。为了保持色布的信用，同时向染布户提出：颜色与皂色严格分开，不得以皂色假冒颜色。经此番整理后，目前高阳布在提高质量上已作出成绩，在市场上经过检验的四千匹白布中，百分之七十已达整庄标准。印花布过去曾用品色及油色，颜色不能耐久，经过研究现在改用蒸色印花（用化学药品及直接色配制），使布的质量已大大提高。
    由于布的质量提高，销路问题也随着解决。目前高阳城关区每集上布七千多匹，卖出达百分之七十以上。在张垣、石家庄、太原等地销路亦很顺畅。邯郸镇亦由九月份每月只销一千三百余匹增至目前每月销售二千一百余匹。现在各厂都在计划扩大营业。该镇金城厂由三台机子增到八台，恒太厂最近由天津运回新式电力机器，计划扩大生产。现该镇棉织业已呈现出新的气象。
