Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government Lin Boqu, President of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government Shen Junru, Vice Premiers of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government Chen Yun, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Nie Rongzhen, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation He Xiangning, Vice Chairmen of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Li Lisan, Liu Ningyi, Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation Liao Chengzhi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League Feng Wenbin, and more than 100 heads of government departments were invited to attend. The banquet proceeded in an atmosphere of close unity. Premier Zhou Enlai first delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country to the delegates and guests from various countries. Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Mrs. Eugénie Cotton, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, delivered a reply. Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation He Xiangning, Vice Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee Bafionova, Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Women's League Park Jung-ae, Vice Chairman of the Czechoslovak People's Assembly Anna Hodinová, Representative of the American Women's Association Elisabeth Minard, Indian Representative Amita Devi, and Mongolian Representative Doronmajava all gave speeches successively.

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech: In the course of the Chinese revolution's 30 years of long struggle, whenever the revolution encountered difficulties, we often thought that we had friends all over the world, first of all, the Soviet Union encouraged us, and the revolutionary movements of various countries encouraged us. Now the situation has turned around, and the victory of the Chinese revolution is encouraging the people of the world who are struggling for national independence, and also encouraging the liberation movements of all oppressed nations. We guarantee to do our best to assist the national independence movements of various countries and the struggles of various countries for lasting world peace. Premier Zhou Enlai said: No revolutionary movement in the world can achieve complete victory without the participation of women. I can contribute China's experience to everyone, that is, the women's liberation movement must be combined with the national independence movement and the people's democratic movement to achieve victory.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said in his welcoming speech: The convening of the Asian Women's Representative Conference shows that the struggle of oppressed humanity has developed to Asia, a relatively backward region in terms of economy and culture, and has widely developed among the women masses of Asia. He said: It is very meaningful to hold this conference in Beijing. A year ago, Beijing was still an unfree place, and after a year, the situation has undergone great changes, and we can hold a meeting like today here. From this, it can be seen that imperialism can be driven away and imperialism can be overthrown! The experience of the Chinese People's Liberation War tells us that to defeat the enemy, there must be broad mass unity and international unity. The task of the Asian Women's Representative Conference is to establish a broad mass-based international unity against imperialism.

In the speeches of Mrs. Eugénie Cotton and representatives and guests from various countries, they unanimously and warmly praised the great victory of the Chinese people, and they pointed out that this victory is also the victory of men and women all over the world.

At the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly stood up to toast for lasting world peace and people's democracy. In Chinese, Russian, Korean, Mongolian, French, and English, everyone chanted in unison: "Long Live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long Live Marshal Stalin!"

　　周总理欢宴各国妇女代表来宾
  　席间各种语言一致欢呼：毛泽东主席万岁！斯大林大元帅万岁！
    【新华社北京十一日电】中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理今晚七时在北京饭店欢宴亚洲妇女代表会议的各国代表和各国来宾。中央人民政府副主席朱德、刘少奇、李济深、张澜，中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠，中央最高人民法院院长沈钧儒，中央人民政府政务院副总理陈云、郭沫若、黄炎培，北京市人民政府市长聂荣臻，中华全国民主妇女联合会名誉主席何香凝，中华全国总工会副主席李立三、刘宁一、朱学范，中华全国民主青年联合会主席廖承志，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬及政府各部门首长百余人应邀作陪。宴会在亲密团结的气氛中进行。周恩来总理首先代表中央人民政府及全国人民向到会的各国代表和各国来宾致欢迎词，朱德副主席代表中国人民解放军致欢迎词，国际民主妇联总书记古久里夫人致答词，中华全国民主妇女联合会名誉主席何香凝、苏联全国妇女反法西斯委员会副主席巴菲诺娃、朝鲜北部民主妇女同盟主席朴正爱、捷克人民议会副议长安娜·荷第罗瓦，美国妇女会代表伊利萨伯·米纳德、印度代表阿米塔·台维、蒙古代表多龙玛贾娃相继发表演说。
    周恩来总理致词说：中国革命经过三十年来长期奋斗的过程，每当革命遇到困难的时候，我们常常想到全世界上有我们的朋友，首先有苏联鼓舞我们，还有各国的革命运动鼓舞着我们。现在情形倒转过来，中国革命的胜利又正鼓舞着世界上各个为民族独立而奋斗的人民，也鼓舞着各被压迫民族的解放运动。我们保证尽最大努力来援助各国的民族独立运动和各国为争取世界持久和平而进行的斗争。周恩来总理说：世界上任何革命运动没有妇女参加是不会达到完全胜利的。我可以将中国的经验贡献大家，这就是妇女的解放运动必须与民族独立运动、人民民主运动结合起来才能得到胜利。
    朱德副主席致欢迎词称：亚洲妇女代表会议的召开，表明被压迫人类的斗争已经发展到亚洲这样经济上、文化上比较落后的地方，而且已经在亚洲的妇女群众中广泛地发展起来了。他说：这个会议在北京召开是很有意义的。一年以前北京还是不自由的地方，过了一年，情形就发生了大变化，我们就可以在这里开今天这样的会。由此可见帝国主义是可以赶跑的，帝国主义是可以打倒的！中国人民解放战争的经验告诉我们，要打倒敌人，必须有广泛的群众团结，必须有国际的团结。亚洲妇女代表会议的任务，就是建立国际的广泛群众性的反对帝国主义的大团结。
    古久里夫人及各国代表和来宾的讲话中一致热烈地称赞中国人民的伟大胜利，他们指出这个胜利也就是全世界男女的胜利。
    宴会上宾主曾数度起立为世界持久和平与人民民主而干杯。中、苏、朝、蒙、法、英各种语言一致高呼着：“毛泽东主席万岁”、“斯大林大元帅万岁”！
