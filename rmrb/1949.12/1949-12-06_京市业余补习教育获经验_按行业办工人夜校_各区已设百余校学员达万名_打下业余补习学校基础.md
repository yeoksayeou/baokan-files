　　Beijing Gains Experience in Spare-Time Remedial Education
　　Worker Night Schools Run by Industry
　　Over 100 Schools Established in Various Districts with Tens of Thousands of Students
　　Laying the Foundation for Spare-Time Remedial Schools
　　[By Our Newspaper] Worker night schools are being universally established in the people's capital, Beijing. Over the past ten months, besides the learning organizations for workers in public enterprises, 110 worker night schools with 231 classes have been established in the twelve districts of the city, with 337 teachers and 7,882 students. Adding the figures from the eight suburban districts, the total reaches 136 schools, 295 classes, 405 teachers, and 9,384 students. Participants include workers from private factories, scattered workers from various industries, and shop assistants. In the ten months of work, each district has gained a lot of experience, the main points of which, regarding organizational work, are as follows: (1) Night schools should be established according to industry, and classes should be divided according to proficiency. This provides many conveniences for teaching. This experience has now been adopted by 88% of the night schools in the city. However, due to limitations in manpower and school site conditions, the current night schools in Beijing that are divided by industry are still divided by large industries (such as industry and handicrafts). In the future, they should gradually move towards establishing night schools by small industries (such as the construction industry and slaughtering industry in handicrafts). (2) Cultural and educational cadres in the districts should not be transferred frequently, otherwise they cannot systematically grasp the situation, and it will not be easy to sort out systematic experiences. For example, during the major cadre reshuffle in October, many night schools showed signs of disorder, and some even collapsed. Districts Five and Four, however, avoided these phenomena because they did not transfer cadres. (3) Cultural and educational cadres should be good at contacting students, and even better at contacting students through teachers. Because teachers directly contact students, teachers play a major role in whether students can learn well and whether the school can be consolidated. In this regard, District Five has created better experience: the district's cadres often convene teachers (mostly teachers and students from major primary and secondary schools) for seminars to tell them the students' opinions and requirements, help them solve these problems, and let them exchange teaching experiences with each other. In this way, not only can the workers' demands and the problems encountered by the teachers be resolved in a timely manner, but also the teachers feel that they can learn a lot from the workers and cadres, and work more actively. Therefore, they launched a long-term competition in teaching, competing for the actual results of each person's teaching. After the students experienced the night school's concern for them, they also took the initiative to come up with many ways to promote their own learning. For example, they bought books themselves and established many mobile libraries under their own management; at the same time, based on the principle of "everyone running the trade union," they are trying out "everyone running the night school," so that everyone assumes certain responsibilities.
　　The night schools developed on the basis of the above experience are loved by the vast number of students and the city's workers. They hope to further improve the night schools and develop them in a focused manner towards the direction of spare-time remedial schools. According to the demands of the masses, the problem that the People's Government and the Trade Union urgently need to solve in the current night school work is to systematically regularize the night schools in a planned way, and to compile textbooks that are more suitable for their needs. As for how to move towards regularization, Beijing is now making necessary preparations in terms of the leadership relationship of night schools, organizational structure, the proportion of various courses, study period, and full-time teachers. Once these problems are resolved, the worker night schools in Beijing next year will surely present a new look.

　　京市业余补习教育获经验
  　按行业办工人夜校
    各区已设百余校学员达万名
    打下业余补习学校基础
    【本报讯】人民首都的工人夜校正普遍建立。十个月来，除公营企业工人另有学习组织以外，在市内十二个区已建立工人夜校一百一十所，二百三十一个班，教员达三百三十七人，学员则有七千八百八十二人；加上八个郊区的数字，共达一百三十六校，二百九十五个班，四百零五名教员，九千三百八十四名学员。参加学习的包括私营工厂工人，各行各业的零散工人及店员等。在十个月的工作中，各区都获得了不少经验，其中属于组织工作方面的，主要的有三点：（一）要按行业建立夜校，按程度划分班级。这样在教学上是有很多方便的。这一经验现已被全市百分之八十八的夜校所采用。但是，因为受人力、校址等条件的限制，目前京市按行业划分的夜校，还是按大行业（如产业、手工业）来划分的；今后应逐步走向按小行业（如手工业中的建筑业、屠宰业等）建立夜校。（二）区里的文教干部不要常调换，否则不能系统地掌握情况，也就不易整理出系统的经验来。例如在十月各区干部大调动时，许多夜校就呈现了紊乱现象，有的甚至垮了台，五区和四区却因为没有调动干部而避免了这些现象。（三）文教干部要善于联系学员，更要善于通过教员联系学员。因为教员直接联系学员，学员能否学得好，学校能否巩固，教员起着重大作用。在这一点上，五区创造了比较好的经验：该区的干部经常召集教员（多数是各大中小学校里的先生和学生）开座谈会，把学员的意见和要求告诉他们，帮助他们解决这些问题，并让他们彼此交换教学经验。这样不但工人们的要求和教员们遇到的问题能得到及时解决，同时，教员也感到可以向工人和干部学习到很多的东西，而更加积极的工作。因此，他们在教学当中展开了长期的竞赛，比赛每个人教学的实际成绩。学员们在体验到夜校对他们的关心后，也主动地想出了很多办法，用以推动自己的学习。如自己买图书，在自己管理下建立了许多流动图书馆；同时也以“大家办工会”的原则，试行着“大家办夜校”，让每个人都负起一定的责任。
    在上述经验基础上发展起来的夜校，为广大学员以及全市工人所热爱，他们希望能够再把夜校提高一步有重点地向业余补习学校的方向发展。根据群众的要求，人民政府与工会在当前的夜校工作中，急待解决的问题，便是有计划地使夜校走向正规化，并且编出更适合于他们需要的课本。至于怎样走向正规化这一问题，现在京市正在从夜校的领导关系，组织机构，各种课程的比重，学习期限，教员专任等各方面作必要的酝酿，一俟这些问题得到解决，明年的京市工人夜校必将呈现一番新的气象。
