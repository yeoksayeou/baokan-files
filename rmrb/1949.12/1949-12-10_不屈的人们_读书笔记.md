    The novel "The Unyielding People," which won the Stalin Prize in 1946, was written by the author Gorbatov based on materials he saw with his own eyes. It tells the story of the Soviet people's love for their motherland and their heroic struggle against the enemy.
    When the German Nazi bandits invaded the Soviet Union, attempting to enslave the Soviet people, this shared disaster closely linked neighbors who had been arguing for forty years: the sixty-year-old craftsman Dallas and his neighbor smoked and sighed together every night... The Germans were repairing the sidewalks, and Dallas said, "They can remodel the sidewalks, but can they remodel my soul? Can they turn me or you into Germans? Can they stomp out my memory? No!" Yes, it was the soul that countless German Nazi bandits could not remodel that answered the question of "how to live" with "unyielding." They would rather destroy the factories they built with their own hands than let complete factories fall into the hands of the Germans; they would rather sacrifice the desire and habit of "not being able to live without working" than work for the Germans; the immortal cause of the Bolsheviks, the locomotive songs sung by the Communist Youth League and the locomotives they built, the joyful sounds of the machines running day and night—could never be stomped out of their memories.
    When the Germans massacred the Jews, the Soviet people willingly and fearlessly protected several orphans. On the street where Dallas lived, they took turns hiding a six-year-old girl in a cabinet, and despite the German police's relentless search, the street did not surrender, not even when the scent of camphor and mold emanated from the girl.
    For the sake of wheat and potatoes, Dallas and many others pushed wheelbarrows, eagerly searching for undamaged land. He met his eldest son, Skibon, a party underground worker supported by the people. He ignited the people's hope like a raging fire. He said to the wanderers: "The German soldiers have suffered a major setback under Stalingrad. The walnut is very strong, and their teeth are not strong enough!" So Dallas returned to his hometown with the hope given by his son, but he also saw the corpses of his underage daughter and countless other outstanding children on the gallows. These were the unyielding people, who followed the truth that "conquered by blood, one must liberate oneself with blood" and faced death calmly. He said, "Now everyone is a party member, taught by the Germans..."
    A red flag was raised on the paratrooper watchtower occupied by the Germans, and war reports written in children's handwriting about the Red Army's victory were posted next to the German war reports. Leaflets filled with the spirit of fighting for the truth were greedily read by the people everywhere, and the unyielding people took action. Finally, the Germans were driven away!
    People came out enthusiastically to repair bridges and roads. Workers drained water from the mines without being ordered. Peasant women frantically scrubbed the names of historical criminals such as "Goebbels" and "Goering" from the walls. Farmers dug out the property of the collective farms from under the snow. Soldiers yearned to return from the front to labor. Everything was seized by the desire for revival.
    The Soviet people are unyielding, and they have achieved permanent victory.

　　不屈的人们
  　读书笔记
    萧南
    一九四六年荣获斯大林奖金的小说“不屈的人们”，是作者戈尔巴朵夫根据亲眼看见的材料写成的，里面叙述了苏维埃人对祖国的热爱与对敌人英勇斗争的故事。
    当德国纳粹匪徒侵入苏联，企图奴役苏联人民的时候，由于这共同的灾难把吵了四十年的邻居亲密联结起来了：六十岁的工匠达拉斯和他的邻人每天晚上在一起抽着烟，叹着气……。德国人在修理人行道了，达拉斯说：“人行道他们能够改造，可是我的灵魂他们能够改造吗？他们能够把我或是你变成德国人吗？他们能够把我的记忆踩掉吗？不！”是的，就是无数的德国纳粹匪徒所不能改造的灵魂，用“不屈服”回答了“怎么活法”的问题。他们宁愿把亲手建立的工厂亲手毁坏，也不叫完整的工厂落在德国人的手中；他们宁愿牺牲了“不劳动就活不下去”的热望与习惯，也不给德国人做工；布尔塞维克不朽的事业，共青团唱过的机车歌和制造的机车，昼夜不停的快乐的机器声——在他们的记忆里，永远不能踩掉。
    当德国人残杀犹太人的时候，苏维埃人心甘情愿的毫不害怕的保护了几个孤儿。达拉斯住的那条街上，轮流着用柜子藏着一个六岁的女孩，尽管德国警察狠命的搜寻着，这条街并不投降，直到从女孩的身上发出樟脑和霉菌气味的时候。
    为了麦子和马铃薯，达拉斯和许多人推着独轮车，热情的寻找没有受到破坏的土地，他遇见了自己的长子斯吉邦——人民拥护的党的地下工作者，他象一把烈火似的燃烧起人民的希望，他对流浪者说：“德国兵在斯大林格勒城下已经大受挫折。胡桃很结实，牙齿还不够有力呢！”于是达拉斯带着儿子给的希望返回故乡了，但也在绞架上看见了自己的未成年的女儿以及其他无数优秀儿女的尸体。这是不屈的人们，他们是遵循着“被血征服了，还得用血来把自己解放”的真理而从容就义的。他说：“现在大家都是党员了，德国人教会的……。”
    德国人占据的伞兵了望台上升起了红旗，用孩子笔迹写着红军胜利消息的战报就贴在德寇战报旁边，充满为真理而战斗的传单，到处被人民贪婪地读着，不屈的人们行动起来了。终于，德国人被赶走了！
    人们欢狂热烈地出来修桥铺路，工人们在矿场上不待命令就抽起水来，农妇们发疯似地涂去墙上“郭培尔”、“戈林”等历史罪人的名字，农夫们从雪堆下翻出集体农场的财物，士兵渴念着劳动从前线归来，一切都给复兴的热望抓住了。
    苏维埃的人们是不可屈服的，他们是永久的胜利了。
