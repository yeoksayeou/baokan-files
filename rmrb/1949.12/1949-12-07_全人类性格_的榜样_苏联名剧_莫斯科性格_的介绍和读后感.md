　　The Model of "Humanity's Character"
    ——An Introduction and Reflection on the Famous Soviet Play "Moscow Character"
    Zhong Jing
    After reading "Moscow Character" in one breath, I was as moved as I was after reading A. Tolstoy's short story "The Russian Character." They both depict the great and noble qualities and souls of the Soviet people, only choosing different characters with the same character and different art forms.

    A. Tolstoy wrote about a heroic tank driver, Yegor Demov. He was seriously injured in the Patriotic War, and his face was burned so badly that he could not even recognize himself, completely turning into a terrifying "unpleasant appearance." At this time, although he stubbornly continued to live and fight, he considered himself finished in love. He dared not use his own name to meet his mother, and that "lively, sweet, happy, gentle" and rare beauty, his lover. But his lover, Katya, replied to him like this: "Yegor, I am determined to live with you for the rest of my life, I will sincerely love you, I will deeply love you..."

    What a tenacious and sublime love! What a pure and lovely character! The author concludes by saying: "Here, you have seen the Russian character!" Yes, this character is called the Russian character.

    "Moscow Character" is also the Russian character, the Bolshevik character.

    The protagonist of this script, which won the Stalin Prize, is Podapov, the director of a tool manufacturing factory. He is an outstanding figure with an iron will, repeatedly creating high production records, and thus won the prize flag and the Minister's "congratulations." Unfortunately, he became more and more complacent, lost his long-term vision, and lost the due sense of fresh things; he gradually degenerated from a Bolshevik who wanted to transform the world into a vulgar factory manager. All victories and merits are his own, and he often says "my factory," "my people," "my plan." "In my factory, I am the master, I am the director, I give the orders." He forgot that the leadership of the Party is the primary reason for all success, forgot the development and progress of the entire cause, and diligently pursued the glory of completing the "my factory" five-year plan in three and a half years. He was once a proponent of the Stakhanov movement, but he slowly became numb and dull. A textile factory in the same district asked him to make a batch of new printing machines invented by two workers in the factory, which were "amazing, highly productive, and infinitely promising machines," "It surpassed Britain, and also surpassed her (referring to the United States - translator's note), it is invincible in the world." But he refused, not because his factory was not capable enough, but simply because he was afraid of trouble, afraid of disturbing his original plan. He does not help his comrades, but wants them to beg "God."

    At this time, it was ineffective for comrades to offer him opinions, and his lover, Glinina, had a dispute with him for the first time because of this, but it did not work either. He disregarded all beneficial Bolshevik advice, and arbitrarily praised these as "speeches," "slogans," "nonsense," or "typical feminine tone." The problem finally had to be resolved, and the Party had a responsibility to help decide "the fate of a new Soviet machine." The District Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) held a meeting, at which it was proved that the machine tool manufacturing factory had the ability to undertake this new order, as long as technology and transportation were improved, etc., everyone and Glinina criticized Podapov, and decided to support the textile factory's request and ask him to prepare for manufacturing immediately.

    Podapov was not convinced enough, but he said: "Everything is no problem, I will do everything. The Party's decision is law to me."

    He did as he said. He enthusiastically and perfectly carried out the Party's decision. His "Moscow character" wanted him to "say one thing and mean it, contribute everything you have to the country: your ideas, your abilities, your heart, your precious life, everything." But he still had "male pride," believing that his lover's criticism at the Party District Committee was "immoral" and "disloyal."

    In fact, it is Glinina, his lover, who truly has "Moscow character," or, to put it more appropriately, has a more typical "Moscow character."

    Glinina has a deep love for her husband and knows her husband's strengths and weaknesses well. Because of this, when Podapov showed narrow complacency day by day, she felt particularly painful. After an argument, there was no result, so she asked the organization to resolve the matter. After serious consideration, she decided to "save his Communist Party member qualities" and could not "remain silent." At the District Committee, she criticized her husband and said: "If a principled issue arises, a Communist Party member must forget family relationships. I am doing just that now...I feel that Comrade Podapov's position on this issue is not the Party's position." At that time, it was "not easy" for her to say these words, as she herself said, "but I felt it was my duty." As a result, her husband was "offended" and did not go home for several weeks, burying himself in the tasks he had accepted. At this time, Glinina was indeed more painful, she longed for her husband, hoping that her husband would move back home and live together; but she did not lose her principles because of this and become a "submissive wife" or "tame lamb" captured by emotions. She told Podapov: "I love you." At the same time, she told him: "Besides being your wife, I am also a Party member." "If you cannot recognize your mistakes, then it is I who do not want to live with you, not you." Here, she has no "feminine tenderness" at all, but stubbornly adheres to Bolshevik principles, using decisive language to answer her beloved husband who has made mistakes.

    "Communists are made of special materials." Comrade Stalin's outstanding assertion is brilliantly demonstrated in "Moscow Character."

    Although Podapov had stubbornly clung to his mistakes and blamed his lover with vulgar views, he finally "bowed his head to the masses" with the help of the Party and his comrades. "Moscow Character" is not only about working tenaciously and contributing everything to the country, but also about not being afraid to admit mistakes and having enough courage to admit one's own mistakes. Therefore, Podapov finally affirmed that Glinina has an "amazing character," and he presented a bouquet of flowers to his lover.

    "Moscow Character" ridiculed workers who only know how to be loyal to a certain "master" without using their brains, like Cai Treif, and praised all those who think and work seriously, with broad and long-term vision, such as Polozova, Klivosh, Krushkova, Glinina...and other brilliant names with Moscow character.

    The love of people made of special materials is also more "special" for some people. All reactionary guys try every possible means to slander Communists, either saying "communization of property and wives," or saying that they have no "emotions." In fact, we are the people who understand emotions the most. What we despise is only the "talented scholar and beautiful woman" style of "darling, darling," or the bourgeoisie's "love supremacy." Their "love" is built on the basis of gold bars and US dollars, with money, they have everything; they are just for playing with women. Today, Mr. Tom is happy and loves Miss Mary, tomorrow he is bored and changes to someone else to change his taste. The "Moscow Character"'s love is just the opposite, it does not use money, status, or kneeling; on the contrary, the men and women in love still retain their respective "characters" and mutual respect, and love has a solid political foundation. Therefore, on the one hand, it is not as fragile as a glass bottle; on the other hand, when it has a "conflict" with the interests of the entire cause, the lovers will forget their personal feelings and insist on the truth and the smooth progress of the cause.

    The ending of "Moscow Character" is a comedy. The people in love become a family, and the lovelorn Victor also takes his lover to attend the wedding of Krushkova, whom he loved before, and congratulates them on their happiness.

    In a word, "Moscow Character" is the purest, most tenacious, and therefore the most beautiful and lovely character in the world. Many philosophers and writers have depicted a vision of human society: where people will be frank and sincere, full of confidence, joy, and selflessness. People will use noble inspiration to replace all jealousy, hatred, prejudice, and even base and vulgar things. Their intentions are good, and I don't know how many people have yearned for it, struggled for it, and even shed blood and sacrificed their lives. The cause failed, and hope was dashed. Thus, it was not until the birth of the great revolutionary teacher Marx that he used scientific theory to prove that this was not a fantasy, and humanity must gradually raise itself to the highest peak of the soul. He encouraged and guided the struggle of the proletariat, and now the struggle has long blossomed, and the Soviet people with thirty-two years of glorious history tell the world with living people and facts: a new kind of human being has appeared, their character has been raised many times more than the old human beings, and they are still using criticism and self-criticism methods to improve themselves step by step, making it more pure, more beautiful, more sublime, more great, and therefore more lovely!

    After reading "Moscow Character," we should understand more and more the meaning of learning from the Soviet Union and the richness of its content. We must not only learn from the Soviet Union's excellent technology, culture, and nation-building experience, but also learn from the excellent qualities of the Soviet people, that is, the excellent qualities of the Bolsheviks.

    "Moscow Character," in other words, is the near future of "Beijing Character"; it is the glorious and splendid future of "all humanity's character," and the day when this example becomes the property of all mankind is not far away.

　　“全人类性格”的榜样
    ——苏联名剧“莫斯科性格”的介绍和读后感
    中静
    一口气读完“莫斯科性格”，我象读了Ａ·托尔斯泰的短篇小说“俄罗斯人的性格”一样感动。它们同样描写着苏维埃人民伟大崇高的品质和灵魂，只是选择了性格相同的不同人物和不同的艺术形式。
    Ａ·托尔斯泰写了一个英勇的坦克手，叶戈德末夫。他在卫国战争中受了重伤，脸被烧焦了，烧得连自己也不认识了，完全变成令人惊恐的“讨厌的样子。”这时，他虽然顽强地继续生活和战斗；但在爱情上，他认定完蛋了。他不敢再用自己的名字去会见他的母亲，和那“活泼、甜蜜、快乐、柔和”的世上少有的美丽的爱人。可是他的爱人，卡娣，却这样答复了他：“叶戈，我决心终身同你一起过活，我要真诚地爱你，我要深深地爱你……。”
    多么顽强又崇高的爱情呵！多么纯洁可爱的性格呵！作者末了说：“这里，诸君看到俄罗斯人的性格了罢！”是的，这种性格就叫做俄罗斯的性格。
    “莫斯科性格”也就是俄罗斯的性格，布尔塞维克的性格。
    这个荣膺斯大林奖金首奖剧本的主人翁是波达波夫，某工具制造厂的厂长。他是有着铁样意志的杰出人物，一再创造了高度的出产纪录，因而得了奖旗和部长的“恭贺”。不幸他越来越自满，失掉了远大的眼光，对新鲜事物丧失了应有的感觉；从一个要改造全世界的布尔塞维克逐渐蜕化为庸俗的工厂管理者。一切胜利和功劳都是自己的，动不动就是“我的工厂”，“我的人”，“我的计划”。“在我的工厂里，我是主人，我是厂长，我下命令。”他忘记了党的领导是一切成功的首要原因，忘记了整个事业的发展前进，而孜孜追逐于“我的工厂”的五年计划三年半完成的光荣。他曾是斯达哈诺夫运动的重视者，但他慢慢麻痹了、迟钝下来了。同一区的一个纺织工厂，请他做一批该厂两个工人发明的新的印花机器，这是一种“了不得的、有高度生产力的、前途无限的机器”，“它胜过了英国，也胜过了她（按指美国——中注），天下无敌。”但是他拒绝了，并不是他那工厂的能力不够，而单纯为了他怕麻烦，怕打扰自己原有计划的缘故。他不帮助他的同志们，而要他们去央告“上帝”。
    这时候，同志们向他提意见没有效果，他的爱人，葛利尼娃，因此和他头一次发生争执，也不行。他毫不考虑一切有益的布尔塞维克的劝说，武断地称道这些是“讲演”、“喊口号”、“胡闹”或“典型的女人腔”。问题终于要得到解决的，党有责任帮同决定“一种苏维埃新机器的命运”。联共（布）党区委会开了一个会，在这会上，证明了那个工具机制造厂有能力担承这批新订货，只要改进技术，改进运输等等就行了，大家和葛利尼娃都批评了波达波夫，并且决定支持纺织厂的要求，要他立刻准备制造。
    波达波夫是不够心服的，但他说：“一切没有问题，一切我都会做的。党的决议对我就是法律。”
    他照着这样做了。他热情而完善地执行了党的决议。他的“莫斯科性格”要他“说一句，算一句，把你所有的一切贡献给国家：你的意思，你的能力，你的心，你宝贵的生命，一切一切。”可是他还有着“男性的骄傲”，认为爱人在党区委会上的批评是“不道德”和“不忠实”。
    其实，真有“莫斯科性格”的，或说得更妥当一些，有着更典型的“莫斯科性格”的，正是他的爱人葛利尼娃。
    葛利尼娃对丈夫有着深厚的爱情，熟知丈夫的优点和缺点。正因如此，当波达波夫一天天显出狭隘自满的时候，她就感到特别痛苦了。拌了一次嘴，没有结果，她便要求组织解决这件事。她经过严肃的考虑，决定“去拯救他的共产党员的品质”，而不能“保持沉默”。在区委会上她批评了她的丈夫说：“假使发生了原则性的问题的时候，共产党员是必需忘记家庭关系的。现在我恰恰是在这样做呢……。我觉得波达波夫同志对这个问题的立场不是党的立场。”当时她讲出这些话，正如自己所说，“并不是很容易的，但是我感到这是我的责任。”结果丈夫被“触怒”了，几个礼拜不回家，埋头在接受下来的任务里。这时候，葛利尼娃确是更加痛苦的，她想望丈夫，希望丈夫搬回家住一起过生活；但却并不因而丧失掉原则，变做被感情俘虏的“顺从的太太”或“驯服的羔羊”。她告诉波达波夫：“我爱你。”同时告诉他：“除掉是你的老婆之外，我还是一个党员。”“假使你不能认识你的错误，那么不愿意和你生活在一起的是我，而不是你。”这里，她一点没有“女性的温柔”，而只是顽强地坚持着布尔塞维克的原则，用斩钉截铁的语言答复她所热爱的犯了错误的丈夫。
    “共产党人是用特殊材料制成的。”斯大林同志这个卓越的论断，在“莫斯科性格”里得到了光辉的表现。
    尽管波达波夫曾经执拗过自己的错误，用庸俗观点责怪他的爱人，他到底在党和同志们的帮助下“向群众低头”了。“莫斯科性格”不光是顽强地工作，把所有一切贡献给国家；还表现在不怕承认错误，有足够勇气承认自己的错误。因此，波达波夫终于肯定了葛利尼娃有一个“了不起的性格”，他并把一束鲜花献给了他的爱人。
    “莫斯科性格”嘲笑了只知道忠于某个“主人”而不动脑筋的工作者，象蔡崔夫一流；赞扬了一切认真思想和工作的，眼光开阔远大的人们，象波罗左娃，克利伏胜，克鲁什可娃，葛利尼夫……等有着莫斯科性格的光辉的名字。
    用特殊材料制成的人的爱情，对于某些人也是较为“特殊”的。一切反动家伙们千方百计地来诬蔑共产党人，不是说“共产共妻”，就是说都是没有“感情”的。实际上，我们是最懂得感情的人。我们所鄙弃的，只是“才子佳人”式的“卿卿我我”，或资产阶级的“爱情至上主义”。他们的“爱情”是建筑在金条美元的基础上，有了钱，就有了一切；他们只是为了玩弄女性。今天汤姆少爷高兴了，爱一位玛丽小姐，明天厌烦了，便换个别人改改口味。“莫斯科性格”的爱情却正与此相反，也不用金钱、地位或下跪；相反的，恋爱着的男女依然保有各自的“性格”和互相的尊敬，爱情是有着坚固的政治基础的。因此，一方面它不象玻璃瓶一样地脆弱；另一方面当它和整个事业的利益有了“矛盾”时，爱人们便会忘却私情，坚持真理和事业的顺利行进。
    “莫斯科性格”的结局是一个喜剧。恋爱着的人们成为眷属了，失恋的维克多也带了自己的爱人，参加他先前爱过的克鲁什可娃的婚礼，并恭贺她们幸福。
    一句话，“莫斯科性格”就是世界上最纯洁、最顽强、因而最优美可爱的性格。不少哲学家和文学家描绘过一幅人类社会的远景：在那里人将是坦白真挚，充满了信心、愉快和大公无私。人将用崇高的必灵去替代一切嫉妒、仇视、偏狭，甚而卑陋下流的东西。他们的用心是良苦的，不知多少人因而向往，奋斗，乃至流了血，牺牲了自己的性命。事业失败了，希望落空了。这样，一直等到伟大革命导师马克思的诞生，才用科学理论证明了这并不是幻想，人类一定要把自己逐步提高到灵魂的最高峰。他鼓舞和指引着无产阶级的斗争，现在斗争早已开了花，有了三十二年光荣历史的苏维埃人民，用活生生的人物和事实告诉全世界：一种新的人类出现了，他们的性格比起旧的人类已经提高了不知多少倍，他们还正在用着批评和自我批评的方法，要把自己再往上提高一步又一步，使它变得更纯洁，更优美，更崇高，更伟大因而更可爱！
    读了“莫斯科性格”，我们应该越发了解学习苏联的意义及其内容的丰富了。我们不但要学习苏联卓越的技术、文化和建国经验，还要学习苏维埃人民的优秀品质，也就是布尔塞维克的优秀品质。
    “莫斯科性格”，换句话说，就是“北京性格”的不久的将来；就是“全人类性格”的光辉灿烂的将来，这个榜样变为全人类所有的那一天的到来，已经不需要多少时候了。
