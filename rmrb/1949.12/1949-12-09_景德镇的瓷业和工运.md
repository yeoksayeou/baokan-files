　　Jingdezhen's Porcelain Industry and Labor Movement

　　I. A Brief History of the Porcelain Industry
　　The development of the porcelain industry in Jingdezhen has a long history. It is said that there were kiln workers working here in the Tang and Song dynasties. Jingdezhen's products have always been famous for their exquisite porcelain and the superb skills of the porcelain workers. In the past, there were the best porcelain "Drunken Red" (containing gold, silver, pearls, agate, and other objects, dazzling and extremely precious), and "Ancient Porcelain" (this kind of porcelain has been highly tempered, and after being preserved for hundreds of years, it is said that meat placed in it will not spoil for dozens of days in the hottest days of the sixth lunar month, which is truly a top-grade porcelain. In the past, many foreigners bought this kind of porcelain at high prices). Unfortunately, the inventors kept the secrets, and they were lost. Jingdezhen porcelain used to be one of China's major export goods. Before the Anti-Japanese War, due to the market competition of imperialism, porcelain was squeezed out of the overseas market by Japanese imperialism. In recent years, due to the impact of continuous wars, porcelain production has declined. Before liberation, all the kiln factories had been shut down. Now, with the support of the people's government, although the products can only meet the needs of the domestic market, there has been a great improvement.
　　II. Revolutionary Tradition
　　During the Great Revolution, more than 90 trade unions were organized in Jingdezhen, as well as workers' pickets, and there were more than 300 guns. Afterwards, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution and, seeing the huge power of the trade unions, ordered the confiscation of the trade union's arms and the arrest of labor leaders and activists. Under such circumstances, the workers' pickets rose up to resist heroically; however, under the violent suppression of the counter-revolutionary armed forces, dozens of workers were killed, and the trade unions were dissolved. This was the famous Dule Massacre at the time. In 1928, under the leadership of comrades Shao Shiping and Li Jiesan, an underground organization (nominally called the Porcelain Research Institute) was organized to lead the labor movement and carry out strikes. Later, it was subjected to armed suppression by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and 43 workers were arrested and taken to Nanchang, where 42 of them were brutally electrocuted to death by the Kuomintang reactionaries. However, the reactionaries did not scare the workers. In 1930, when the Red Army arrived in faraway Jingdezhen, the workers stood up again; at that time, more than 20,000 workers joined the Red Army. After the Red Army went north to resist Japan, the labor movement in the area turned into underground activities. In 1943, under the leadership of Comrade Zhou Hui, the city of Jingdezhen organized a marching liaison station to maintain contact with the New Fourth Army. When the New Fourth Army arrived in the city, more than 20 trade unions were immediately established. After the Southern Anhui Incident, a massacre of workers by reactionaries also occurred in Jingdezhen, causing the labor movement to suffer a temporary setback. This April, the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River. The workers were very excited, and when the People's Liberation Army arrived in Wuyuan, many kiln workers organized to greet them. The first time the People's Liberation Army allowed them to set off to liberate Jingdezhen immediately, the workers set off to return to Jingdezhen, but on the way back, they encountered the Kuomintang 38th Army forcibly recruiting laborers, and some workers were captured; the second time, the kiln workers organized more than 3,000 people to greet them, and this time they finally achieved the workers' wishes. After the People's Liberation Army arrived in Jingdezhen, the workers actively helped to eliminate the local reactionary armed forces and secret agents, organized workers' pickets, collected the guns left by the Kuomintang, captured the Kuomintang's local负责人负责 [responsible person], and found many important documents. The pseudo-county magistrate hid in the countryside, preparing to organize counter-revolutionary activities, and was also captured.
　　III. The Criminal Rule of the Kuomintang Reactionaries
　　In addition to several counter-revolutionary massacres in Jingdezhen, the Kuomintang also frequently carried out assassinations of workers in the vicinity of Jingdezhen, and workers were often buried alive. In 1936, the Kuomintang organized more than 50 pseudo-trade unions in the area to suppress the labor movement. In order to implement a deceitful policy and fool the workers, the reactionaries also established a so-called "Wage Assessment Committee" to increase the capitalists' exploitation of the workers. The assessment committee met every two months, nominally calculating wages according to the prices of oil, salt, firewood, rice, and other five items. In reality, under the skyrocketing prices, coupled with the sabotage of the assessment committee, the workers' lives were extremely difficult. Ordinary workers who received wages of one stone of rice could actually only buy three or four dou of rice when they received their wages. When workers asked for wage increases, the Kuomintang asked them to "send their heads" (meaning that the workers should send a representative to be beheaded, and it was impossible to increase wages. The workers called "sending their heads" "eating grass," because they would drag the representative to the mountains to be killed). There were several workers who volunteered to be the "heads" when everyone's life was really impossible to solve, and their families were taken care of by everyone, fully demonstrating the spirit of self-sacrifice, unity, and mutual assistance of the working class.
　　Under the rule of the Kuomintang, many factions were formed among the workers, including the Qing and Hong gangs and the Kiln, Miscellaneous, and Levy three major gangs, and the Feng, Yu, Cao, and Jiang four major surnames. Using these sects, the Kuomintang often provoked workers' infighting in order to disperse the workers' unity in order to achieve the purpose of forever enslaving and ruling the workers.
　　IV. Resumption of Work and Business
　　In May this year, after the Kuomintang fled, the bosses closed down the kiln factories. At that time, the workers' lives were very hard. Because some capitalists did not pay wages, some workers had to live by fishing, carrying rice, picking screws, and eating wild vegetables. After liberation, the Second Field Army's Labor Movement Department sent more than 20 cadres to the city to help the workers organize a temporary trade union preparatory committee. A joint meeting of industry and commerce was also convened to promote the start of work. However, due to the impact of the war, there was no market for porcelain, the market was sluggish, and the capitalists had concerns in their minds, fearing that there would be a recurrence of the struggle against capitalists in 1930. Therefore, this meeting did not yield results. Later, when the sales of porcelain began to be smooth, a few smaller and more active factory owners started work first with the support and promotion of the people's government. At this time, most factory owners were still waiting to see. When our state-owned enterprises purchased large quantities of porcelain at market prices and organized a transportation team of more than 40 vehicles to transport large quantities of porcelain to various places for sale, this attracted the attention of factory owners and porcelain merchants. They began to experiment with sales, and the results were brisk. The factory owners then started factories one after another to resume production. Porcelain merchants also rushed from near and far to place orders. On September 18 this year, the local people's government convened the first labor-capital consultation meeting, rationally adjusted wages in accordance with the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and encouraging capitalists to resume production, which further encouraged the capitalists. Later, in conjunction with the loan support front movement, some larger capitalists were also encouraged to start work by borrowing from landlords and rich peasants who did not invest in production and specialized in usury, and capitalists who were unwilling to resume work and production. According to statistics in September, among the 9,897 workers who resumed work in the city, 8,439 were kiln workers. Of the 103 kiln factories in the city, 73 had resumed work. The output of the 73 kiln factories in September was 45,173 shi 8 shou 6,860 tong (10 large pieces make one tong, 4 shou make one shi, and 8 small pieces make one shou), which exceeded the city's monthly output of 38,720 shi 4 shou 5,880 tong before liberation by about 17%. Now, with the assistance of the people's government and the trade company, the difficulties of porcelain sales and transportation have been solved. Merchants from Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places have come to Jingdezhen to purchase goods one after another, and the market is becoming increasingly prosperous. According to the statistics of the tax bureau in September, the average daily sales volume reached more than 2,200 shi. In October, the number of people who resumed work reached more than 11,000, and the number of workers who resumed work exceeded 70% before liberation. In the future, after the liberation of the whole country, the future of Jingdezhen's porcelain industry is immeasurable.
　　In other industries, with the increasing prosperity of the Jingdezhen market, the large-scale production of kiln factories, and the increasing awareness of workers, it is believed that the workers here will soon be organized.

　　景德镇的瓷业和工运
    江西省总工会主任  郭光洲
    一、瓷业发展简史
    景德镇瓷业的发展已有很长的历史，相传唐、宋时，本地即有窑工做工。景德镇的出品，一向是以瓷质的精细，和瓷工技术的高超而闻名于世。往昔曾有最好的瓷器“醉红”（瓷中含有金、银、珍珠、玛瑙等物，光彩夺目、珍贵异常），和“古瓷”（这种瓷器曾经高度锻炼，经保存数百年，据说六月三伏天，将肉类放置其中，数十天不坏，实为瓷中上品。从前曾有很多外国人以高价收买此类瓷器）的出产，后惜因发明人保守秘密而竟失传。该地瓷器曾经为我国大量外销的出口货物之一。抗战前因帝国主义市场竞争，瓷器在海外市场受到日本帝国主义的排挤。近年来又因连战争的影响，瓷器出产遂一蹶不振。解放前所有的窑厂曾全部停工，现在人民政府的扶植下，虽然目前产品还只能供给国内各地市场需要，但已大有起色。
    二、革命的传统
    在大革命的时候，景德镇就组织了九十几个工会，还组织了工人纠察队，并且有三百多条枪。嗣后蒋介石叛变革命，见工会势力浩大，竟下令缴除工会武装，逮捕工人领袖和积极分子。工人纠察队在这种情形下，曾起而英勇抵抗；但在反革命武装优势的暴力镇压下，几十个工人被打死了，工会被解散了，这便是当时有名的都乐惨案。一九二八年在邵式平、李杰三同志的领导下，组织了一个地下组织（名义上叫瓷器研究所），领导工人运动，进行罢工。后又遭到国民党反动派的武装镇压，逮捕了四十三名工人，并带到南昌，有四十二名被国民党反动派残酷地用电烧死。但是反动派并没有把工人吓倒、一九三○年，红军抵达远景德镇时，工人们又站立了起来；那时有两万余名工人参加了工农红军。红军北上抗日以后，该地的工人运动又转变为地下活动。一九四三年，在周惠同志的领导下，景市组织了行军联络站，与新四军保持联络。在新四军到达该市时，曾立即成立了二十余个工会。皖南事变发生后，景德镇也发生了反动派大肆屠杀工人的事件，使工运又暂时蒙受挫折。今年四月，解放军横渡长江。工人们非常兴奋，在解放军到达婺源时，有很多窑业工人组织起来前往迎接。第一次在解放军允许即日起程解放景德镇时，工人们即起程返回景市，但在归途上碰见国民党三十八军抓夫，有些工人给抓走；第二次窑工又组织三千多人去迎接，这一次终于达到工人们的愿望。解放军到达景德镇后，工人们就积极帮助清除地方上的反动武装和特务分子，组织了工人纠察队，收集了国民党遗留的枪支，抓到了国民党在当地的负责人，搜出了很多重要文件，伪县长躲到乡下，准备组织反革命活动，也被抓了回来。
    三、国民党反动派的罪恶统治
    国民党除了在景德镇制造了几次反革命的大屠杀之外，并且在景德镇附近时常进行暗杀工人的活动，常有工人遭到活埋。一九三六年，国民党在该地组织了五十几个伪工会，进行镇压工人运动。反动派为了施行欺骗政策，愚弄工人，又建立了一个所谓“工资评判委员会”，增加资本家对工人的剥削。评判会两个月召开一次，名义上是按照油、盐、柴、米五项物价折算工资，实际上在物价暴涨之下，再加上评判会从中捣鬼，使工人生活极度困苦。普通拿一石米工钱的工人，到发工资时，实际上只买得到三、四斗米。工人要求增加工资，国民党却要他们“派头”（意思是要工人派一个代表去杀头，增加工资是办不到的。工人称“派头”为“吃草”，因为是把代表拉到山里去杀）。曾有几个工人在大家生活实在无法解决时，自动去做“派头”的“头”，他的家属则由大家来照顾，充分的表现了工人阶级自我牺牲团结互助的精神。
    在国民党的统治下，在工人中间形成了很多派别，有青、红帮及窑、杂、征三大帮，和冯、余、曹、蒋四大姓。利用这些宗派，国民党常挑拨工人械斗，以便进行分散工人的团结，以求达到永远奴役和统治工人的目的。
    四、复工复业情况
    今年五月间，国民党逃走后，老板们把窑厂都歇了。当时工人的生活很苦。因为有些资本家不发工资，有些工人只有靠捕鱼、担米、拾螺丝、吃野菜过活。解放后，二野工运部派了二十几个干部，在城里帮助工人组织了一个临时工会筹委会。并召集了一次工商联席会议，推动开工。可是因为战争的影响，瓷器无销路，市场萧条，和资本家思想上存在着顾虑，害怕会有一九三○年斗资本家的事情发生。因此这次会议未获结果。后来瓷器销路开始畅通，才有几家较小较积极的厂主在人民政府的扶助和推动下首先开工。这时大多数厂主仍持观望。及至我国营企业按市价大量收购瓷器，并组织了四十几辆汽车的运输队，大量运输瓷器到各处销售，这样便引起了厂主和瓷商的注意。他们这时开始试验推销，结果销路畅旺。厂主们于是纷纷开厂复业。瓷商也远近赶来订货，今年九月十八日，当地人民政府召集了第一次劳资协商会议，按照劳资两利，鼓励资本家复业的政策，合理的调整了工资，这样更鼓励了资方。后来配合借款支前运动，在多向不投资生产专放高利贷的地主富农及不愿复工复业的资本家借款的情况下，又推动了一些较大的资本家开工。据九月份统计，在全市复业工人九、八九七人中，窑工就达八、四三九人，全市一○三家窑厂，已有七三家复工。九月份七三家窑厂的出产量为四五、一七三石八手六、八六○仝（大器大十个为一仝，小器四手为一石，八个小器为一手），较解放前全市每月的产量三八、七二○石四手五八八○仝计，约超过百分之十七。现在在人民政府及贸易公司的扶助下，解决了瓷器的销路和交通运输等困难，京、沪、汉各地客商已相继前来景市采购，市面日趋繁荣。九月份据税务局的统计，平均每天的销出量即达二千二百石之多。十月份复业人数已达一万一千余名，复业工人较解放前已超过百分之七十。将来全国解放后，景德镇瓷业的前途是未可限量的。
    在其他各业方面，在景德镇市面日益繁荣，窑厂大量生产和工人觉悟日益提高的情况下，相信此地的工人也将会很快的组织起来。
