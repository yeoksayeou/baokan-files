　　The French-Vietnamese Reactionary Government Will Reap What It Sows
    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, issued a stern statement last month on the 29th, warning the French government and the governments of other countries bordering China not to harbor the Kuomintang remnant bandits. The statement said: "Thoroughly eliminating all Kuomintang reactionary armed forces is the unshakeable policy of our government. No matter where the defeated Kuomintang reactionary troops flee, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China reserves the right to inquire into this fact, and the government of any country that harbors the Kuomintang reactionary armed forces must be responsible for this fact and bear all the consequences arising therefrom." That is to say, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army must thoroughly and cleanly eliminate all the remaining forces of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, without letting any escape. However, French imperialism and its puppet Bao Dai dared to ignore the warning of our Central People's Government and dared to protect more than 10,000 remnants of the Bai bandits who fled into Vietnam. Moreover, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army was encircling and annihilating the remnants of the Kuomintang Huang Jie's troops who attempted to cross the border and flee into Vietnam, French imperialism even sent aircraft from Vietnam to openly violate our country's airspace, attempting to cover the bandit troops' escape to Vietnam. The Chinese people cannot tolerate such sinful acts of French imperialism and its running dogs, who are hostile to the Chinese people and harbor the Kuomintang remnant bandits. We must once again seriously warn French imperialism and its running dogs: The shameful conspiracy you are now carrying out has been exposed in front of the people of the world. Your sinful acts of being enemies with the Chinese people and harboring the Kuomintang remnant bandits have already caused serious consequences, and you must swallow this bitter fruit. The Chinese people will fully support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in pursuing and annihilating the fleeing bandits and will never be lenient.

　　法越反动政府将自食其果
    我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长上月二十九日曾发表严正声明，警告法国政府及其他和中国国境毗连的各国政府不许窝藏国民党残余匪军，声明中说：“彻底消灭国民党所有反动武装力量，乃我政府不可动摇的政策。不管战败了的国民党反动军队，逃到什么地方，我中华人民共和国中央人民政府都保有权利过问这一事实，而容留国民党反动武装力量的任何国家的政府必须对此事实负责，并承担由此产生的一切后果。”这就是说，中国人民和中国人民解放军一定要彻底干净全部消灭国民党匪帮一切残余力量，不使漏网。但是，法帝国主义及其傀儡保大竟不顾我中央人民政府的警告，胆敢保护逃入越南的白匪残部万余人，并且当中国人民解放军正在包围歼灭企图越过国境逃入越南的国民党黄杰部残匪时，法帝国主义竟由越南派出飞机，公然侵犯我国领空，企图掩护匪军向越南逃窜。法帝国主义及其走狗这种敌视中国人民窝藏国民党残余匪帮的罪恶行为，是中国人民所决不能容忍的。我们必须再一次严重警告法帝国主义及其走狗：你们现在所进行的可耻的阴谋，已经在全世界人民的面前被揭穿了，你们与中国人民为敌窝藏国民党残余匪帮的罪恶行为，已经造成了严重的后果，你们就一定要吞食这个恶果。中国人民将以全力支持中国人民解放军追歼逃匪，决不宽待。
