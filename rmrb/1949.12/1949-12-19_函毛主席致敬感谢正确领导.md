　　Letter to Chairman Mao: Respect and Gratitude for Correct Leadership
    The full text of the letter from the China National Salvation Association to Chairman Mao is as follows: Chairman Mao Zedong:
    We are reporting to you that the China National Salvation Association is formally concluding its operations today.
    Over the past fourteen years, the China National Salvation Association has done some work in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and in the People's Liberation War, and has implemented our work goals.
    During these fourteen years, thanks to your and the Chinese Communist Party's correct leadership in thought and action, and your constant assistance, we were able to do some good things for the Chinese people without making serious mistakes.
    Now the largest part of China has been liberated, the people have stood up, and an independent and free People's Republic of China has been established. We have reached such a satisfactory situation that our organization, the China National Salvation Association, no longer needs to exist.
    All this glory should belong to you, and should belong to the Chinese Communist Party. We firmly believe that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. Without you—the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong—there would be no glorious victory of the Chinese People's Revolution.
    For your correct leadership, and the help given to us by the comrades of the Chinese Communist Party, we, the members in Beijing, representing all the members scattered at home and abroad, express our most sincere gratitude to you and the Chinese Communist Party. We assure you that we will always follow the Communist Party under the banner of Mao Zedong!
    With the most sublime revolutionary salute!
    China National Salvation Association (signatures omitted)

　　函毛主席致敬感谢正确领导
    【新华社北京十八日电】中国人民救国会向毛主席致敬函，全文如下：毛泽东主席：
    我们向您报告：从今天起，中国人民救国会正式结束了。
    过去十四年来，中国人民救国会在抗日救亡运动中，在抗日战争中，在人民解放战争中，都作了一些工作，并且贯彻了我们的工作目标。
    十四年中间，由于您和中国共产党在思想、在行动上正确地领导我们，不断地帮助我们，我们才能够给中国人民做了一些好事，没有犯严重的错误。
    现在全中国最大部分地区已经解放，人民已经翻身，一个独立自由的中华人民共和国已经建立起来。我们到达了这样一种圆满的境地，以至于我们中国人民救国会这一种组织，已经没有继续存在的必要了。
    这一切的光荣，应当属于您，应当属于中国共产党。我们十分相信：没有共产党就没有新中国。没有您——中国人民领袖毛泽东主席，也不会有中国人民革命的光辉的胜利。
    为了您的正确的领导，和中国共产党同志们给予我们的帮助，我们，在北京的会员们，代表了散在国内外各地的全体会员们，仅向您和中国共产党表示最诚恳的感谢。我们向您保证：我们要永远在毛泽东旗帜之下跟着共产党走
    致最崇高的革命敬礼！
    中国人民救国会（签名略）
    一九四九年十二月十八日
