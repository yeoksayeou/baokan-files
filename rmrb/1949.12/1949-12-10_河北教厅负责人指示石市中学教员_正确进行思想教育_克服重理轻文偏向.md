(By Our Newspaper) A responsible official of the Hebei Provincial Department of Education recently gave instructions at an enlarged cadre meeting of middle school teachers and staff in Shijiazhuang on several major problems existing in the city's secondary education and the direction of future efforts. Firstly, there is a lack of planning in conducting political and ideological education through various subjects. In order to further improve teaching efficiency, it is necessary to: (1) fully understand the purpose of ideological and political education in each subject. For example, the Soviet Union has five teaching goals in natural science teaching, the main purpose of which is to enable students to establish a dialectical materialist worldview; (2) each lesson or unit should address a specific problem and achieve a specific goal, which should be studied by the teaching group and not taught randomly; (3) grasp the requirements of ideological and political education to be achieved by certain social activities in a certain period; (4) teachers of all subjects should clearly understand what problems students currently have in ideological and political terms and patiently come up with solutions from various perspectives. Only in this way can students' thinking of serving the people be cultivated and exercised.

Secondly, in terms of cultural learning, students have a bias towards mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The solution to this problem lies in teachers and students understanding that today's education emphasizes the equal importance of morality, intelligence, and physical education, requiring students to have correct ideological understanding, be cultured, and be physically healthy. All subjects must develop in a balanced way, and each subject should reach a certain level. Any deficiency in any subject is a loss. Balance is not the same as averaging, and it does not contradict the individual development of students. This view should be mastered by every student under the leadership of teachers and further become the student's conscious movement.

　　河北教厅负责人指示石市中学教员
    正确进行思想教育
  　克服重理轻文偏向
    【本报讯】河北省教育厅负责人最近在石家庄市中学教职员扩大干部会议上，对当前该市中等教育中所存在的几个主要问题及今后努力方向作了指示。其一，在通过各科进行政治思想教育时，缺乏计划性，为了进一步提高教学效率，应该：（１）充分理解各科中思想政治教育的目的，例如苏联在自然教学上有五条教学目标，主要是达到使学生树立辩证唯物论世界观的目的；（２）每一课或每一单元要解决一个什么问题，要到达一个什么目的，都应该经过教学小组研究，不能乱讲；（３）掌握一定时期一定社会活动所要达到的思想政治教育的要求；（４）各科教员要明确掌握目前学生在思想政治上存在着什么问题，耐心地从多方面想出办法解决。唯有如此，才能培养与锻炼出学生的为人民服务的思想。
    其二，在文化学习方面，学生中有着偏重数理化的偏向。解决这一问题的方法在于教师与学生了解今天的教育是德、智、体三者并重，要求学生思想认识正确，有教养，身体健康。各科并须平衡发展，各门功课应该达到一定水平，任何一课有了缺陷都是损失，平衡也不是平均，它和学生的个性发展没有矛盾。这种观点应该在教师领导之下而为每一个学生所掌握，进一步成为学生的自觉运动。
