Harbin's Workers' Night Schools

After more than two years of work and education, the political consciousness of Harbin's workers has been significantly raised, and they urgently require improved literacy and technical skills. Therefore, starting in the second half of last year, the focus began to shift from predominantly political education to primarily cultural learning, and from large classroom training sessions to mainly after-work night schools. Following the night school work representative meeting held this April (attended by teachers, students, and trade union cadres), the direction towards standardization was further clarified, taking a long-term perspective, with specific academic systems, unified curriculum materials, and relatively complete organizational leadership and systems.

From our practical work experience, it has been proven that the principle of "worker education should focus on culture after the enlightenment stage" is correct. There are over 36,000 organized workers in the city of Harbin, and nearly 20,000 workers are currently participating in night school studies. Of these, over 14,000 regularly attend classes, accounting for approximately 38 percent. Their literacy levels have generally improved. According to materials from seven joint night schools, first-year students recognize at least 150 characters, second-year students can generally write simple letters, third-year students can write short essays, fourth-year students can write diaries and correspondences, and fifth and sixth-year students can write relatively complete articles and use punctuation.

　　　　Main Experiences

1.  Running after-work night schools well should be based on a long-term perspective, and there should be a set of relatively standardized systems because improving literacy is not a short-term blitz task, nor can it be effective based solely on temporary enthusiasm. Standardized systems include having specific organizations and regulations, such as principals, academic directors, and teachers each having their own responsibilities, with a clear division of labor; establishing night school meetings, arranging and inspecting work, jointly studying teaching materials and progress, and discussing teaching plans; dividing classes according to literacy levels, with specific class times, such as Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, two hours each day, specific semesters, regular exams, and establishing promotion, demotion, and reward/punishment systems, and granting diplomas upon graduation.

2.  To ensure that night schools are well-run, teachers teaching well plays a decisive role. Teachers must not only be fully prepared before class, but also closely integrate with the workers, listen to their opinions on learning, understand their psychology and requirements, check teaching results, and seek continuous improvement. They must use examples and vocabulary familiar to workers, and especially in teaching methods, they cannot teach like they teach elementary school students. Workers generally have stronger comprehension skills, but weaker memory. Therefore, explanations do not need to be verbose, but attention should be paid to review.

3.  To make workers truly feel that night school is their own, it is necessary to emphasize workers running night school themselves, managing themselves. Class, grade, and group leaders are democratically elected by the workers, and workers are mobilized to formulate their own discipline agreements, hold specific learning review meetings, and promote the collective spirit of mutual help and mutual supervision. This can better ensure the completion of learning tasks.

4.  To run night schools well, there must be close collaboration between the Party, the government, and the trade union. A unified night school work guidance committee should be established at the municipal level to systematically resolve various night school issues, and the Party and government should provide strong support. Party and League members should play exemplary backbone roles in night schools, grasp active elements, and promote everyone's learning.

　　　　Several Major Issues

1.  In general, the joint night schools in various districts are run better, with students mostly being workers from private factories, while the night schools in public factories, with a few exceptions, are generally poorer. The success of night schools in public enterprises mainly depends on whether the administrative side attaches importance to it. From the current situation, it seems that the administrative side of public enterprises does not attach enough importance to worker night schools. Trade union cadres in public enterprises are mostly provided by the administration, and the General Trade Union feels it is somewhat difficult to intervene. Furthermore, due to the larger scale of public enterprises, although workers are relatively concentrated, their literacy levels are not, making it difficult to divide classes according to level, which also affects night school work. This situation should be changed in the future.

2.  Emphasizing cultural learning is the main focus, which we believe is correct and has yielded certain results. Focusing on cultural learning does not mean canceling political education. In addition to integrating political content in cultural classes, there are other forms, such as weekly lectures, newspapers, radio broadcasts, commemorative meetings, and large reports. In addition to production time, workers attend six hours of night school every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and we believe that these six hours are necessary. If they are further reduced, it will be difficult to learn culture. Thus, the remaining free time feels insufficient. Therefore, how to closely integrate it with production education and how to conduct systematic historical materialism education have not yet been adequately resolved. We plan to solve this problem in the curriculum content.

3.  Most night school teachers are elementary school teachers who also hold these positions concurrently, and elementary school teachers themselves are very busy. Therefore, elementary school teachers who also hold night school positions must be given appropriate consideration, such as increasing the number of night school teachers, reducing teaching hours, and finding ways to cultivate more teachers from among the employees. The General Trade Union held a night school teacher training class during the summer vacation, which was very effective, and proved that employees with high cultural levels are more suitable for teaching workers than elementary school teachers because they are familiar with workers' lives, emotions, and requirements. In addition, we should find ways to mobilize a group of university students and agency staff to serve as teachers. We are preparing to do this, otherwise it will be difficult to meet the requirements of the increasingly expanding worker night school work.

### 哈市的工人夜校

　　哈市的工人夜校
    哈尔滨工人的政治觉悟，经过了两年多的工作和教育，已有了相当的提高，迫切要求提高文化和技术。因此从去年下半年起，即开始从以政治为主的教育转变为以学习文化为主，从以训练班上大课为主的方式转变为以业余夜校为主的方式。经过今年四月召开的夜校工作代表会（由教员、学生、工会干部参加）后，更明确规定了走向正规化的方针，从长期观点出发，有一定的学制、统一的课程教材和比较完整的组织领导和制度。
    从我们实际工作的体验中，证明了“工人教育经过启蒙阶段后应以文化为主”的方针是正确的。哈市市辖范围内有组织工人共三万六千余人，现参加夜校学习的工人近两万人，能经常到校学习者一万四千余人，约占百分之三十八。在文化程度上普遍的提高了一步，根据七个联合夜校的材料，一年级至少认识一百五十字，二年级一般的能写简单的信，三年级能作短文，四年级能写日记和通讯，五六年级能写比较完整的文章，使用标点符号。
    　　　　主要经验
    一、办好业余夜校应从长期观点出发，要有一套比较正规的制度，因为提高文化不是短期的突击任务，也不能单凭一时的热情所能收效的。正规的制度包括有一定的组织和制度，如校长、教务主任、教员等各有职责，分工明确，建立夜校会议、布置及检查工作，共同研究教材、进度及讨论教学计划；按文化程度分班，有一定的上课时间，如星期一、三、五、每天两小时，一定的学期，定期考试，建立升降班及奖惩制度，毕业时给予文凭。
    二、要使夜校办好，教员教好有决定的作用。教员教好不仅课前要有充分的准备，而且应与工人密切结合，倾听工人对学习的意见，了解工人的心理和要求，检查教学效果，求得不断的改进，要用工人熟悉的事例和语汇，特别是教学方法上不能跟教小学生一样，工人一般的理解力较强，但记忆力差些，因此解释不必罗唆，但需要注意复习。
    三、要使工人真正感到夜校是工人自己的，必须强调工人自办夜校，自己管理自己，班、级、组长由工人民主选举，发动工作自己订立纪律公约，召开一定的学习检讨会议，发扬互相帮助互相监督的集体精神，这样可以更好的保证学习任务的完成。
    四、要办好夜校，必须党、政、工各方面的密切结合，市一级应成立统一的夜校工作指导委员会，有计划地解决夜校各种问题，而党、政应给予有力的支持，党、团员要在夜校中起模范的骨干作用，掌握积极分子，推动大家学习。
    　　　　几个主要问题
    一、一般的是各区联合夜校办得比较好，学生多系私营工厂工人，而公营工厂的夜校除了少数外，一般的都较差。公营企业夜校的好坏主要决定于行政方面是否重视，从今天情况看来，公营企业行政方面对工人夜校是重视不够的，公营企业工会干部大都由行政供给，总工会方面感到有些难于插手。再，由于公营企业规模较大，工人虽然比较集中，但文化程度不集中，按程度分班比较困难，也影响夜校的工作。这种情况，今后应有所改变。
    二、强调学习文化为主，我们认为是对的，并收到一定的效果。以文化为主并不等于取消政治教育，除在文化课结合政治内容外，还有其他形式，如星期讲座、报纸、广播、纪念会、大报告等配合。工人除生产时间外，每周一、三、五，上六小时的夜校，而这六小时我们认为是必需的，若再减少，学文化便很困难，这样，其余的业余时间就感到很不够用，因此，如何与生产教育紧密结合，如何进行系统的唯物史观教育，现尚未得到适当的解决，准备在课程内容上解决这一问题。
    三、夜校教员多系小学教员兼任，小学教员本身又很繁忙，因此兼任夜校工作的小学教员必须给予适当照顾，如增加夜校教员数量，减少教课时间；设法从职工中多培养教员，今后暑期总工会办了一期夜校教员训练班，收效很好，并证明了文化水平高的职工教工人比小学教员还较适宜，因熟悉工人的生活、情绪和要求。此外，应设法动员一批大学学生及机关工作人员来当教员，我们正准备这样做，否则难以满足日益开展的工人夜校工作的要求。
