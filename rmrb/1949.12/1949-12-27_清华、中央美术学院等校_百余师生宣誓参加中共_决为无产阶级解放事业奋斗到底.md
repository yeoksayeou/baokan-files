　　Over a Hundred Teachers and Students Swear to Join the CCP
    Determined to Fight to the End for the Liberation of the Proletariat
    [Beijing News] At the National Tsinghua University, Central Academy of Fine Arts, Municipal Fourth Boys' High School, Third Girls' High School, Hebei High School, Private Shandong High School, and other schools, over a hundred students and teachers gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party around Stalin's seventieth birthday. The over one hundred new Party members of Tsinghua University held their admission ceremony on the 21st of this month. Facing the portraits of Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong, they made a solemn oath: to resolutely fight to the end for the cause of the liberation of the proletariat! After the oath, comrades from the Tsinghua CCP General Branch immediately rushed forward to put red flowers on the new comrades and warmly shake hands and embrace them. After the meeting, the Tsinghua Youth League branch and students from the Department of Aeronautics wrote congratulatory letters to the new Party members and sent them books such as "A Brief Biography of Stalin" and "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)."
    Wu Zuoren, Dean of Studies at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, said in his speech at the admission ceremony for new Party members: In the past, many people did not have enough understanding of the Communist Party, but now they have gradually come to understand it. When we look at these six newly admitted students, aren't they all actively striving and respected in our school, whether in their studies, work, or other aspects? This better illustrates that what the Communist Party wants to absorb are the most outstanding members.
    Eight new Party members joined the Party at the Fourth Boys' High School, and all of the over one thousand teachers and students were invited to participate in the admission ceremony. New Party member Zhang Yingxuan (an old physics teacher) recounted his thirty-year journey of searching for truth and the Communist Party at the meeting. His sincere self-criticism aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience.
    The atmosphere was very warm at the admission ceremony for new Party members at Shandong High School. A comrade from the Student Branch Work Section of the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CCP earnestly encouraged the new Party members to study hard and strive to be exemplary Communist Party members. After the oath, many students rushed to the stage to speak, unanimously expressing that they must strive to become Communist Party members in the future. After the meeting, many Youth League members immediately went to find the CCP branch secretary of Shandong High School to request application forms for Party membership.

    中央美术学院教务长吴作人在新党员的入党仪式会上讲话中说：过去有好多人对共产党认识不够，可是现在已渐渐的认识了，我们看这六位新入党的同学，他们在我们学校里，无论在学习上、工作上或其他方面，那个不是积极努力受人尊敬的？这就更好地说明了共产党要吸收的是最优秀的分子。
    男四中有八个新党员入党，全体师生一千多人都被邀参加入党仪式。新党员张映轩（老物理教员）在会上叙述了他三十年来寻找真理、寻找共产党的经过，他的恳切的自我批评，激起了全场热烈的掌声。
