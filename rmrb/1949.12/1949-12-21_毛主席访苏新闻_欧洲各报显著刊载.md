　　Mao Zedong's Visit to the Soviet Union
　　European Newspapers Extensively Reported
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th] Chairman Mao's visit to Marshal Stalin has aroused extreme attention from the entire European public opinion circle. As the French Communist Party's "Ce Soir" newspaper stated, "Different commentators all acknowledge that Mao Zedong's visit is a historically significant event." The French Communist Party's L'Humanité and Ce Soir, the British Communist Party's Daily Worker, the Hungarian Communist Party's Szabad Nép, and others, all published this world-shaking news on the front page in the most prominent position. The headline of the first news item on the front page of Paris' "Le Monde" on the 18th was: "Upon arrival in Moscow, Mao Zedong was immediately received by Marshal Stalin." In the editorial titled "China and the Soviet Union" on the same day, Le Monde said: "This is a symbolic event, and also a prominent depiction of the great changes that have been completed in Asia not long ago and the resulting changes in the balance of world power."

    【新华社布拉格二十日电】毛主席的访问斯大林大元帅引起了整个欧洲舆论界的极端重视，正如法共“今晚”报所说的“不同的评论家们均承认毛泽东这一访问是富有历史意义的大事”。法共的人道报、今晚报，英共的工人日报，匈共的自由人民报等，均把这一震动世界的新闻登载于第一版最显著的地位。巴黎“世界”报十八日头版第一条新闻的标题是：“到达莫斯科后毛泽东立即为斯大林大元帅所接见”。在同日题为“中国与苏联”的社论里，世界报说：“这是一个有象征意义的事件，也是不久以前在亚洲所完成了的大变动以及因此而改变世界力量对比的一个特出的形容。”
