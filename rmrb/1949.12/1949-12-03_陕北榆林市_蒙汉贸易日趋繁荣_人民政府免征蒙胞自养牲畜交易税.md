Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 30th — Since liberation, industry and commerce in Yulin City, northern Shaanxi, have rapidly recovered, and Mongolian-Han trade has become increasingly developed. Yulin borders the Yikezhao League and is a center for Mongolian-Han trade. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the city had more than 400 border merchants, mostly engaged in purchasing hides and furs from Mongolian areas and transferring them to Beijing and Tianjin. Merchants from Beijing and Tianjin also set up shop in Yulin for purchasing. Livestock trade and handicrafts such as saddles, saddlebags, and felt blankets were also very developed in the area in the past. Grand mule and horse fairs were held every year in the first, fifth, seventh, ninth, and tenth months of the lunar calendar. The highest record between 1936 and 1937 was over 5,000 livestock transactions in a single mule and horse fair. Before liberation, Mongolians who came to Yulin for the fairs were often subjected to various forms of oppression and exploitation by the local Kuomintang reactionary government. The mule and horse fairs were suspended from 1946. Border merchants gradually decreased due to the destruction of exorbitant taxes and levies, and handicrafts such as saddles and felt blankets also declined. After the liberation of Yulin this year, the Yulin Municipal People's Government held three mule and horse fairs successively in the seventh, intercalary seventh, and ninth months of the lunar calendar to promote Mongolian-Han trade and exchange urban and rural materials. During the fairs, the Yulin City Tax Bureau specially collected transaction taxes on the spot to facilitate transactions for merchants. Mongolians were exempted from taxes on the sale of their own raised livestock after registration and certification by the Chamber of Commerce and the Border Industry Association. Trade companies also supplied Mongolians with goods such as sugar, cloth, and water tobacco at prices lower than the market price. When holding the mule and horse fairs, the fair preparatory committee invited Mongolians attending the fairs to have dinner, watch operas, and listen to their opinions on improving Mongolian-Han trade and strengthening Mongolian-Han unity, and explained to them the People's Government's policies on ethnic groups and trade. Therefore, Mongolians were very enthusiastic about attending the fairs, and Mongolian-Han trade and handicrafts in Yulin are gradually recovering and prospering.

　　陕北榆林市
    蒙汉贸易日趋繁荣
  　人民政府免征蒙胞自养牲畜交易税
    【新华社西安三十日电】陕北榆林市解放以来工商业已迅速恢复，蒙、汉贸易日趋发达。榆林地接伊克昭盟、为蒙汉贸易中心。抗战前全市四百多家边商，多从事收购蒙地皮毛，转输北京、天津。京、津各地商人也有在榆林坐庄收购的。该地牲畜贸易和马鞍、口袋、毡毯等手工业过去也很发达。每年农历正月、五月、七月、九月、十月，都举行盛大的骡马大会。一九三六——三七年间的最高纪录，一次骡马大会成交的牲畜达五千多匹。解放前，因蒙胞到榆林赶会，常受当地国民党反动政府的种种压迫和剥削，一九四六年起骡马大会即陷于停顿。由于苛捐杂税的摧残，边商日渐削减，马鞍、毡毯等手工业也日益萧条。今年榆林解放后，榆林市人民政府为繁荣蒙汉贸易，交流城乡物资，在农历七月、闰七月、九月曾先后举行了三次骡马大会。在举行大会时，榆林市税局为便利客商交易，特在会场就地征收交易税；对蒙胞出卖自己喂养的牲畜。经商会和边业公会的登记证明后，准予免税。贸易公司也以低于市价的价格，供应蒙胞所需的糖、布、水烟等货物。举行骡马大会时，大会筹备会都邀请赶会蒙胞聚餐看戏，听取蒙胞对于改进蒙汉贸易和加强蒙汉团结的意见，向他们解释人民政府有关民族和贸易的政策。因此，赶会蒙胞极为踊跃，榆林的蒙汉贸易和手工业日渐恢复繁荣。
