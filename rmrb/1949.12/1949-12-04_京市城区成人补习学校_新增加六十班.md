　　Adult Literacy Schools in Urban Beijing
　　New Addition of Sixty Classes
　　[Beijing News] Adult literacy education in Beijing has seen further development. In November, the number of adult night schools in the twelve districts of the urban area increased from 131 to 195; the number of students increased from 4,764 to approximately 7,000. In order to learn from experience and better lead this work, the Municipal Education Bureau is directly running an adult night school. Generally speaking, the current problem is how to more deeply and extensively mobilize laborers dispersed throughout various production departments to participate in learning, and to overcome the phenomenon of student turnover. In addition, appropriate improvements must be made in terms of teaching materials and methods. In response to these problems, the Municipal Education Bureau will convene a joint meeting of the heads of the Cultural and Educational Bureaus of the urban districts and a meeting of the staff of the adult night schools within the week to discuss specific improvement measures.

　　京市城区成人补习学校
  　新增加六十班
    【北京讯】北京市成人补习教育，已有进一步的发展。在十一月份，城厢十二个区的成人夜校由一百三十一班增加到一百九十五班；参加学习的人数由四千七百六十四人增加到七千人左右。为了吸取经验以便更好地领导这一工作，市政府教育局直接主办了一所成人夜校，一般说来，目前存在着的问题，是如何深入地更多地动员分散在各个生产部门内的劳动者参加学习，并克服学习流动的现象。此外，在教材、教法方面也须加以适当的改进。针对这些问题，市政府教育局将于周内分别召集城区文教科长联席会议及各处成人夜校工作人员会议，以便研讨具体改进办法。
