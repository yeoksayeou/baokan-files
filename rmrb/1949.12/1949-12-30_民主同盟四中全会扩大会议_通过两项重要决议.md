　　Democratic League Fourth Plenary Session Enlarged Meeting
　  Passes Two Important Resolutions
  　Resolution on Accepting the Common Program and Suspending the Democratic League Program
    After hearing the report from the delegation of our League attending the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, we unanimously believe that this People's Political Consultative Conference, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, has achieved brilliant success. This conference has achieved great accomplishments that will forever remain in human history. The three major documents passed by this conference, namely the Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, are undoubtedly the three major legal foundations for the founding and building of our People's Republic of China. These are three unprecedented major legal documents in Chinese history.
    We express our special support for the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which is the greatest people's charter in human history.
    The People's Charter is the guiding star of our Chinese people's democratic dictatorship. By following this general direction, we can achieve the complete victory of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism, and carry the revolution through to the end; we can steadily advance from New Democracy to Socialism and then to Communism!
    The People's Charter lays the foundation for the people's democratic dictatorship's organs of power at all levels in the People's Republic of China.
    The People's Charter establishes a system of consolidating national defense and the people's armed forces.
    The People's Charter determines the economic policy of developing the people's economy and steadily transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country.
    The People's Charter points out the path of national, scientific, and mass cultural education for the People's Republic of China.
    The People's Charter points out the path of making the People's Republic of China a big family of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups.
    The People's Charter points out the path for the People's Republic of China to stand on the side of the international democratic and peaceful camp headed by the Soviet Union to safeguard the lasting peace of the world.
    We recognize that the entire Charter is completely correct, suitable for China's national conditions, and a program suitable for the needs of the times.
    This program is the common program of the people's democratic united front, and our League is a political group of the united front. The delegation of our League attending the CPPCC has participated in the work of formulating the Common Program. This shows that the Common Program is the program of our League.
    Therefore, the enlarged meeting of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the China Democratic League resolves:
    (1) The enlarged meeting of the Fourth Plenary Session of the China Democratic League sincerely and solemnly accepts the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as the program of the China Democratic League. We accept the entire spirit and text of the Common Program. We call on all League members to unanimously support this Common Program and assume the responsibility for realizing this great charter.
    (2) Based on the above resolution, this meeting announces that, from the date of the passage of this resolution, the program passed by the Provisional National Congress of our League in 1945 will cease to be used.
    (3) This meeting accepts the report of the delegation of our League attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and recognizes that the delegation has faithfully fulfilled its responsibilities and completed its tasks. This meeting expresses its deep appreciation.

    Resolution on Endorsing the 1950 National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budget and Issuing People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds
    The two proposals passed by the Central People's Government this time, the 1950 National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budget and the issuance of People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds, are important measures to stabilize the people's economic life, balance revenue and expenditure, and stabilize prices. This meeting unanimously resolved to warmly endorse and support them, and called on all League members to strive to ensure the 100% realization of these two major proposals.
    First, with regard to the 1950 Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budget, the fact that the People's Government was able to compile this planned, step-by-step, and methodical budget within less than a month and a half of its establishment fully demonstrates the People's Government's responsible and pragmatic spirit. This budget is indeed the most reasonable budget that meets the current practical requirements. Today, the war is still ongoing, but military expenditures account for only 38.8%, which is something the Kuomintang reactionary government never had. Administrative expenses account for 21.4%, which is because the old Kuomintang army and old public education personnel are included, the purpose of which is to take care of their lives and give them appropriate education and transformation. This principle is completely correct. Investment in state-owned enterprises accounts for 23.9%, which includes investment in farmland water conservancy, railways, state-owned industries, etc. Today, when the national finances are so difficult, it is evident how much our government attaches importance to economic construction work that such a large proportion can be invested in national economic construction. Chairman Mao said: "We must completely restore economic undertakings within three to five years." From the budget, we know that there is absolute certainty. Although cultural, educational, and health expenditures account for only 4.1%, this does not include the living expenses of cultural, educational, and health workers. If these are included, it will exceed this proportion, which is already commendable given the continued war and the great economic destruction. This budget is very reasonable in both revenue and expenditure estimates, considering both what is possible and what is needed. Our League absolutely supports the implementation of this budget.
    Secondly, the issuance of Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds is an even more important method to eliminate the currency crisis, stabilize prices, make up for deficits, overcome financial difficulties, and strive for economic victory. In 1949, there were three price fluctuations. The experiences and lessons of these three price fluctuations made us realize that the crisis of inflation must be gradually overcome, and the society's surplus purchasing power must be used and controlled. Issuing bonds is the most effective means to overcome inflation and utilize surplus social purchasing power. The issuance of these Victory Bonds has several characteristics. First, these are truly Victory Bonds, because our current economic difficulties are difficulties in victory. Issuing these bonds is to quickly unify the whole country and embark on the victorious road of economic recovery and development. Every Chinese person will surely support the issuance of these bonds in order to strive for early victory and achieve stable lives. Second, these bonds are issued in inflation-adjusted units, and both principal and interest are paid based on commodities. This ensures that those who purchase the bonds not only do not have to worry about losses due to currency depreciation, but also, like inflation-adjusted savings deposits, can recover both principal and interest together upon maturity. Therefore, they will surely be enthusiastically purchased by the people, because buying bonds is equivalent to inflation-adjusted savings deposits, which benefits both oneself and others. Why not do it? Third, the total issuance amount is not large, and the term is very short. In terms of the amount issued, there are a total of 200 million units, which is equivalent to only 200 million yuan in pre-war currency, and it is still issued in two phases. In terms of the repayment period, all will be repaid within five years, with 10% repaid in the first year and 15% increased each year thereafter. This takes into account the current burden capacity of industrialists and merchants and is in line with the principle of mutual benefit for both public and private interests, fairness, and reasonableness. We believe that after the issuance of Victory Bonds, it will definitely be supported by industrialists and merchants across the country, and its promotion will inevitably achieve satisfactory results.
    We fully endorse the Central People's Government's two major resolutions on the 1950 revenue and expenditure budget and the issuance of Victory Bonds, and we are willing to call on compatriots across the country to work hard for the implementation of these two major resolutions.

　　民主同盟四中全会扩大会议
　  通过两项重要决议
  　关于接受共同纲领及停止民盟纲领的决议案
    我们听到了本盟出席中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体大会的代表团报告以后，一致认为这次人民政治协商会议在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的领导之下，有了光辉的成功。这次会议有了永远留在人类历史上的伟大成绩。这次大会所通过的三大文件，即中国人民政治协商会议组织法、中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法和中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，无疑的这是我们中华人民共和国开国与建国的三大法律基础。这是中国历史上空前的三大法案。
    我们对于中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领特别表示拥护，这是人类史上最伟大的人民大宪章。
    人民大宪章是我们中国人民民主专政的指南针。遵循着这个大方针，我们可以达到反帝国主义、反封建主义、反官僚资本主义的彻底胜利，将革命进行到底；我们可以由新民主主义稳步地前进到社会主义，到共产主义！
    人民大宪章奠定了中华人民共和国人民民主专政的各级政权机关的基础。
    人民大宪章树立了巩固国防人民武力制度。
    人民大宪章确定了发展人民经济、稳步变农业国为工业国的经济政策。

    人民大宪章指示了使中华人民共和国成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭的道路。
    人民大宪章指示了中华人民共和国站在以苏联为首的国际民主和平阵营方面以保障世界的持久和平的道路。
    我们认定整个大宪章是完全正确的，适合中国国情的，适合时代需要的纲领。

    拥护一九五零年度财政收支概算案与发行人民胜利折实公债的决议
    这一次中央人民政府所通过的一九五○年全国财政收支概算和发行人民胜利折实公债两案是安定人民经济生活、平衡收支、稳定物价的重要措施。本会议一致决议予以热烈的拥护与支持，并且要号召全体盟员为保证这两大法案之百分之百的实现而奋斗。
    首先以一九五○年财政收支概算案来说，在人民政府成立不满一个半月之内，就能编制出这一个有计划有步骤有办法的概算出来，这充分足以表示人民政府做事负责，实事求是的精神。这一概算案确是切合目前实际要求的一个最合理的概算。今天战争还在进行，而概算中军事费仅仅占百分之三八．八，这是国民党反动政府所从来没有过的。行政费占了百分之二一．四，这是因为国民党旧军队和旧公教人员都包括在内，其目的是为了照顾他们的生活并给他们以适当的教育改造，这一原则是完全正确的。国营事业投资占百分之二三．九，它包括了农田水利、铁路、国营工业等等的投资，在国家财政如此困难的今天，能有这么大的一个比例投资在国民经济建设上，这可以看出我们的政府是如何注重经济建设工作。毛主席说：“我们要在三年五年的时间内，把经济事业完全恢复起来”，从概算中便知道是绝对有把握的。文化教育卫生费虽仅占百分之四．一，但这是文化教育卫生工作者的生活费不算在内的，如把这计算进去，就会超过这一比例，在战争继续进行和经济破坏极大的情况下，已是难能可贵了。这一概算案，无论收入或支出的估计都非常合理，量出为人与量人为出兼顾并筹，取之合理，用之得当。本盟绝对拥护这一概算案之实施。
    再以第二案发行胜利折实公债来说，这更是消除货币危机、稳定物价、弥补赤字、战胜财政困难、争取经济胜利的一个最重要的方法。一九四九年内，曾经有过三次的物价波动，在这三次物价波动的经验与教训中，使我们认识通货膨胀的危机必须逐步予以克服，社会的过剩购买力必须加以运用与管制。发行公债正是克服通货膨胀，运用社会过剩购买力最有效的手段。这次胜利公债的发行有几个特点，第一，这是名副其实的胜利公债，因这我们今天的经济困难是胜利中的困难。发行这次公债是为迅速统一全国，走上恢复和发展经济的胜利道路，每一个中国人为争取早日胜利，达到生活安定，自必会拥护这一公债之发行的。第二，这一公债以折实单位发行，还本付息均以实物为标准，这样使购买公债的人，不但不必担心币值下跌的损失，而且正如折实储蓄存款一样，到期之后，保本保息，连本带利，一起收回，所以它自必会得到人民之踊跃购买，因为购债等于折实存款，利已利人，何乐不为。第三，发行总额不大，这本斯限很短。以发行额来说，共二万万分，合战前币值不过二亿元，而且还是分两期发行。以还本期限来说，五年之内，全部还清，第一年还百分之十，以后每年递增百分之十五，这既照顾到当前工商业者的负担能力，又符合公私两利，公平合理的原则。我们相信：胜利公债发行之后，一定可以得到全国工商业者的拥护，它的推销必然可以达到完满的成绩。
    我们完全拥护中央人民政府一九五○年收支概算与发行胜利公债这两大决议，并愿号召全国同胞为这两大决议的实施而努力奋斗。
