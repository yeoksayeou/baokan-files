Tsinghua University's School Affairs Committee issued a call for review this month on the 22nd, amidst the welcoming of the victorious New Year, in order to summarize the semester's learning achievements. The Student Union also convened a meeting of chief representatives from various departments to convey the call and explain in detail the significance and purpose of this review campaign, as well as all necessary preparations. The school's previous review campaign last semester played a certain role in summarizing learning, such as commending achievements, exchanging experiences, and criticizing shortcomings. These experiences will be used to guide this semester's review campaign to achieve even better results. The School Affairs Committee also called for this review to be combined with the future teaching work policy, focusing on strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism and streamlining the curriculum. Students should proceed in a planned and step-by-step manner under the leadership of their departments and with the help of teachers. During the review period, they should continue to actively discuss and study the plans of each department to improve teaching efficiency and streamline the curriculum, stipulating principles and specific steps as a reference for future final decisions. Teachers and students at the school generally attach great importance to this review campaign to summarize learning. Some teachers have suggested that before the final exam, teachers should first examine their own teaching methods and textbook content during the semester, summarize the advantages and disadvantages in order to improve; at the same time, deeply understand the students' requirements, formulate review outlines, let students know what the key points are, and help students summarize.

　　总结学习成绩清华发动温课
    【本报讯】迎接胜利新年声中，清华大学校务委员会于本月二十二日发出温书号召，以便总结这学期的学习成果。学生会也召开了各院系首席代表会议，传达了号召，并详细地说明了这次温书的意义、目的以及一切必要的准备工作。该校上学期温课运动，在总结学习上，如表扬成绩、交流经验、批判缺点等方面，曾起了一定的作用，这些经验将用以指导这学期的温课运动，使它做出更好的成绩。校委会并号召这次温课应结合今后教学工作方针，着重加强马列主义学习及研究精简课程。同学应在系的领导及教师的帮助下，有计划的有步骤的进行。在温课期间，仍应继续积极讨论及研究各该系的提高教学效率与精简课程计划，规定原则及具体步骤，以为将来作最后决定之参考。该校师生一般都很重视这次总结学习的温书运动。有的教师提出建议，在大考前，教师自己首先检查这学期中的教授方法及教材内容，总结优缺点，以便改进；同时深入了解同学的要求，拟定复习提纲，让同学知道那些是重点，帮助同学总结。
