　　Therefore, in the future, the following issues should be noted in the work of improving the specialist system:

　　A. The leadership must clearly recognize that teaching and learning are the central tasks of school education. The participation of teachers in excessive social activities that hinder teaching should be appropriately reduced.

　　B. Teachers should closely integrate professional study with lesson preparation, and appropriately utilize study groups or mutual aid groups in guiding students' self-study. The teaching affairs office should systematically guide and control this work to gradually correct the phenomenon of emphasizing science over the humanities and the neglect of political classes in some schools.

　　C. In terms of leadership ideology, due importance and consideration should be given to teachers' professional learning. Because after the establishment of general systems in the construction of new education, curriculum issues are a fundamental issue (curriculum issues include the content of the curriculum – teaching materials, teachers' mastery of teaching materials, and teaching methods), and the improvement of teachers' quality is the central key to this issue.

　　D. Teachers must study and master the examination system so that examinations become a general review, general inspection, teaching summary, and learning competition. It must be based on daily learning.

　　The above points have been formally raised at the joint meeting of principals of public secondary schools convened by the Education Bureau in early November, as the main content for each school to improve the specialist system. In the future, with the joint efforts of the responsible authorities of each school, the specialist system will be further improved and become one of the common goals for all secondary schools in Beijing to improve teaching.

　　鼓励认真钻研业务继续健全专任制度
    因此，今后在健全专任制的工作上，应注意以下几个问题：
    甲、领导上须明确认识到：教与学为学校教育的中心工作。对教员参加过多妨害教学的社会活动，应适当的减少。
    乙、教师在准备功课上应密切地结合业务学习，在指导学生自学上，应适当地运用学习小组或互助小组。教导处应有计划地指导和掌握这一工作，以逐步纠正重理轻文与某些学校的轻视政治课的现象。
    丙、领导思想上，应对教师的业务学习予以应有的重视与照顾。因为新教育的建设问题，在一般的制度树立以后，课程问题则为一基本问题（课程问题包括课程的内容——教材、教师掌握教材，以及教学方法诸问题），而教师质量之提高，则为这一问题之中心关键。
    丁、教师须研究和掌握考试制度，使考试成为一种总复习、总检查、教学总结和学习竞赛。它必须以平日的学习为基础。
    以上几点在十一月初教育局所召开的公立中等学校校长联席会议上，已经正式的提出来，作为各校健全专任制的主要内容。今后在各校负责当局的共同努力下，专任制度将更加健全起来，而成为北京市所有中等学校改进教学的共同目标之一。
