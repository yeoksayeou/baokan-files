　　Stalin's Former Residence

　　The village of Gori in the Tiflis region is solemnly situated at the foot of a steep cliff, where the high mountains abruptly descend, next to a prominent river flowing towards an orchard-connected plain. A grim and dilapidated fortress towers over the mountain's edge, overlooking the entire town. On this elevated village street, surrounded by a small marble chapel, stands the small house where Stalin was born.

　　Stalin's former residence has two rooms, one occupied by the landlord and the other by Stalin's father and mother. Measuring thirteen feet long and twelve feet wide, this small yet elegant room has two French windows opening onto a small corridor and a cobblestone street. Inside, every piece of furniture is neat and clean. Set into the walls are two cupboards with sliding doors, one for storing the daily rolled-up bedding, and the other for dishes and cooking utensils. On one side of the wall stands a rustic, crimson-colored wardrobe, next to a small dish rack with an oil lamp and a revolving round mirror attached with a candle holder. Additionally, there are tables, chairs, and an old oak bed with adjustable spirals at both ends where Stalin slept as a child, still arranged as it was before.

　　Stalin's birth certificate and various photographs from his youth hang on the wall of the landlord's room. This room has marble pillars, so small that the entire house can be seen at a glance. It also has a dimly lit and eroded roof. The dark small pillars and the white roof above are very harmonious with the house they serve, as are the black and white stone squares that connect the canopy to an Italian-style garden. This garden is surrounded by a short-cropped evergreen hedge, only waist-high, behind which are taller shrubs and the like.

　　Stalin lived here for a long time, spending his childhood and adolescence here.

　　斯大林的故居
    弟弗里斯州哥里村庄严地位置在一道削壁之麓，高山从这里陡然低趋，旁边是一条流向果园毗连的平原的突起的河，一座阴森而颓坏的堡垒高踞山边，雄视着全镇。在这个高地的村庄街道上，四周围着大理石小教堂中矗立着的小屋，这便是斯大林诞生的地方。
    斯大林的故居有二个房间，地主住一间，斯大林的父亲和母亲住另一间。十三英尺长，十二英尺宽，这个虽小倒也朴雅的房间，有着二扇落地窗，开出去是小走廊，和圆石砌成的街道。在房里每一家具是整齐而清洁，墙壁中嵌着二口装有移门的碗橱，一口置藏每天卷起来的被褥；另一口则置放碗碟和烹饪用具。墙壁的一边放着农家式的纷红色的衣橱，旁边是一只小小的食器架，挂着一只洋灯和一面可转动的圆镜，旁边附有洋烛的插架。此外还有桌子、椅子和一架斯大林小时睡的二头有着活动螺旋的旧橡木床，现在仍陈列布置得和以前一模一样。
    斯大林的出生证明书和他年青时代的各种照片都挂在地主房间里的墙上，这房间里有着大理石的柱子，那柱子细小得整个屋子可以一览无余；它又有着薄光而剥蚀的屋顶，那暗黑的小柱和上面的白屋顶，跟他们所供奉的屋子，以及方方铺着的黑白石块，倒很是和调，这些铺石联接了天盖和一座意大利式的花园，这花园围着剪短的常绿的高仅及腰的篱笆，后面是较高的灌木之类。
    斯大林在这里住得很久，他的童年和少年时代就是在这里度过的。
