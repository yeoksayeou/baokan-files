  　New Atmosphere in Coastal Defense Troops After Studying CPPCC Documents

    After more than a month of studying the "CPPCC Documents," all commanders and soldiers clearly realized that the victory of the People's Liberation War in all of China and the establishment of the "People's Republic of China" were only the first step in the long march of the Chinese revolution. If China is to transform from an agricultural country into an industrial country and enter socialist society, it not only requires the leadership of the working class, the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation, and the unity of the people to engage in various constructions; but also requires a strong national defense force to protect it. Therefore, the commanders and soldiers unanimously stated: "We must not only be founding heroes, but also glorious nation-building heroes!" The soldiers are also honored and proud to shoulder the great task that "the People's Liberation Army will always be a fighting force." The soldiers of a certain battalion wrote a letter to Commander-in-Chief Zhu, saying:
    "Respected Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
    We salute you from the coastal defense line. When the superiors conveyed the assurances you made on behalf of the entire army to the people of the whole country at the CPPCC, the joy in our hearts could not be expressed in words. We really felt as if we were seeing you. We are wholeheartedly accepting the orders you give us. We seriously discussed and all expressed: 'Resolutely eliminate personal plans, launch intense regular training on the coastal defense line, further improve in military, political, and cultural aspects, move towards regularization and national defense, and execute your orders! Rest assured,' Respected Commander-in-Chief. Take good care of your health so you can lead us in the revolution to the end. Finally, we extend our highest respect to you!"
    During the study, veteran soldiers cherish their past struggle history even more, wanting to consolidate and promote it; new soldiers regret joining the revolution late and are determined to strive for meritorious service for the people in nation-building. At the same time, everyone recognizes the value of the past hard work style and has increased the enthusiasm for large-scale military training. After the troops studied "Several Basic Reasons Why the Chinese Revolution Could Succeed," Du Guangyu, a new soldier of the first company of a certain regiment, said: "The old comrades have struggled hard for the Chinese revolution, which is so glorious! And I was still serving as a soldier for Yan Xishan half a year ago and have not contributed anything to the new China!" So he expressed to the whole class: "Resolutely strive to be a model in military training!" Therefore, he actively trained. When it rained, he automatically practiced military movements in the house, and whenever there was extracurricular time, he helped the landlord with work.
    The branch committee of the fourth company of a certain regiment made a resolution to call on the company: "Launch a three-comparison movement: First, compare ourselves with the field army carrying out combat missions. They are marching and fighting in wind, frost, rain, and snow; we should defend the coast and complete regular training missions with a fighting spirit. Second, compare ourselves with the past hard days. In the past, we also marched, fought, climbed mountains, and waded through water in wind, frost, rain, and snow; we should maintain that excellent style. Third, compare ourselves with the people in disaster. Today, the folks in the disaster areas are struggling with the disaster situation; we should save everywhere to reduce the people's burden and relieve the victims, and fight against the consciousness of enjoying comfort!"
    Now they are studying military affairs, politics, and culture with a fighting spirit; they are also overcoming difficulties with a fighting spirit. The troops are building barracks. In order to reduce the burden on the people and save civilian labor, they have gathered comrades with special skills, such as those who have worked as stonemasons, bricklayers, carpenters, etc., and formed a construction brigade. All the soldiers are also using their spare time to carry earth and make adobe, building their own defenses on the coastal defense line. The soldiers said excitedly: "The motherland's coast is our home!"

　　“祖国的海岸就是我们的家”
  　海防部队学习政协文献后的新气象
    肖萌
    经过一个多月的“政协文献”学习后，全体指战员都明确的认识到人民解放战争在全中国的胜利和“中华人民共和国”的成立，只不过是中国革命过程中的万里长征的第一步。中国要由一个农业国变为一个工业国，以进入社会主义社会，不但需要以工人阶级来领导，工农联盟为基础，全国人民团结起来，共同努力从事各种建设；而且，还必需要有一支强大的国防军来保卫着它。因此，指战员们都一致表示：“不但要当开国英雄，而且更要当一个光荣的建国英雄！”战士们也都以肩负着“人民解放军永远是个战斗队”的伟大任务而光荣，自豪。某营的战士们给朱总司令写信说：
    “敬爱的朱部司令：
    我们在海防线上向你敬礼。我们学习了政协文献，当上级传达你在政协会上代表全军向全国人民表示的保证时，我们心中的高兴，文字是不能写出的，我们真的是好象见了你。我们是在全心全意的接受着你给我们的命令。我们认真的讨论，都表示：‘坚决去掉个人打算，在海防线上展开紧张的正规训练，作到军事政治文化都要进一步的提高，向正规化，向国防化迈进，来执行你的命令！放心吧，’敬爱的总司令。好好保养你的身体，好领导我们革命到底。最后，向你致以最高的敬礼！”
    在学习中，老战士更加受护自己过去的斗争历史，想巩固它，发扬它；新战士们则遣憾参加革命晚，坚决要在建国中争取为人民立功。同时，大家都认识到过去艰苦作风的可贵，而提高了大练兵的情绪。当部队学习了“中国革命能够胜利的几个基本原因”后，某团一连新战士杜光宇说：“老同志们曾为了中国革命而艰苦奋斗，这是多么光荣啊！而我在半年前还为阎锡山当兵，对新中国一些没有贡献！”于是就向全班表示：“在练兵中坚决争取模范！”所以，他就积极练兵，天下雨时，他自动的在屋子里练习军事动作，每到课外时间，就帮房东去干活。
    某团四连支部委员会作出决议向连队号召：“开展三比运动：首先向执行着战斗任务的野战军比，他们正在风霜雨雪中进军，战斗；我们就应以战斗的精神，保卫海防和完成正规训练的任务。二，和过去的艰苦日子比，过去我们也曾在风霜雨雪中进军、战斗、爬山、涉水；现在应该保持着那种优良的作风。三，要和在灾难中的人民比，今天灾区的老乡们正向灾情困难作斗争；我们应该处处节约以减轻人民负担和救济灾民，要向闹享受的意识作斗争！”
    现在正以战斗的精神，努力学习军事、政治、文化；也正以战斗的精神来克服困难。部队建设营房，为了减轻人民负担和节省民力，将有特长的同志们，如过去作过石工、泥瓦工、木工……的人才都集中起来，组成了一个建设大队，全体战士们也都正在利用课余时间抬土、打坯，在海防线上建设自己的防地。战士们都兴奋的说：“祖国的海岸，就是我们的家！”
