Hebei Cooperatives Sign Contracts with Other Provinces to Develop Winter Production for the Masses
　　Selling Large Quantities of Homespun Cloth in Exchange for 60 Million Jin of Grain

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Cooperatives in various parts of Hebei Province, through signing contracts with cooperatives in other provinces, specialized companies, and private factories, are exchanging products to promote material exchange and assist farmers in production and disaster relief. The province's main sideline productions include weaving homespun cloth, weaving sacks, weaving mats, mountain goods, and digging up medicinal materials. Homespun cloth production is particularly widespread throughout the province. From September to early November, more than forty exchange contracts have been signed with cooperatives in other provinces, various specialized companies, and private factories. 870,000 bolts of homespun cloth (excluding current sales), 11 million jin of hide glue, 50,000 reed mats, and 10 million jin of sea salt have been sold; in exchange, 60,085,6294 jin of various grains and 340 million yuan in RMB have been obtained. This achieves planned production and sales, appropriately overcoming the blindness in cooperative business. Furthermore, direct connections have been established between cooperatives and producers, reducing market competition and stabilizing prices, as well as reducing the exploitation of small producers by commercial capital; strengthening the connection between various cooperatives and public and private enterprises; and providing leadership and promotion for grassroots cooperative business. At the same time, because of the large-scale exchange, much manpower consumption and freight expenses have also been reduced.

Based on the experience of this contract signing, the following points should be noted in the future:

1.  Before signing a contract, a detailed and thorough estimate must be made of the cost of goods, freight, damage, packaging costs, production situation, price trends, and one's own strength, without any carelessness.

2.  The content of the contract must be clear, detailed, and comprehensive, such as the time, quantity, quality, exchange location, loading and unloading fees, handling fees, damage, etc., with clear regulations and defined responsibilities; the contract language must be clear, affirmative, and popular, and not ambiguous, in order to reduce unnecessary losses. For example, the yarn exchange contract between the original Jizhong Cooperative and the Chahar Cooperative did not specifically specify the quality of the yarn, resulting in the exchange of inferior yarn, which affected the reputation of Jizhong homespun cloth among the masses. Another example is the corn exchange between the province and the Heilongjiang Cooperative. Because the contract did not specify where the delivery should take place, the unloading was delayed, and both parties shirked responsibility, causing many avoidable losses.

3.  To ensure the smooth execution of the contract, the principle of mutual benefit must be grasped when signing the contract, especially between cooperatives and between public enterprises. The principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit must be adhered to, and narrow departmentalism must be overcome. It is also important to overcome the hypocrisy of merchants.

　　河北各地合作社同外省订合同
  　发展群众冬季生产
    销出大宗土布换回粮食六千万斤
    【本报专讯】河北省各地合作社，通过订立合同方式与外省合作社、专业公司、各私营工厂交换产品，以促进物资交流，扶助农民生产救灾。该省主要副业生产织土布、织口袋、编席、山货、刨药材等，土布生产更是遍及全省。从九月起到十一月上旬止，已与外省合作社、各专业公司、私营工厂，共订立交换合同四十多个。已销出土布八十七万匹（现卖数不在内），皮硝一千一百万斤，苇席五万片，海盐一千万斤；换回各种粮食六千零八十五万六千二百九十四斤，人民币三亿四千余万元。做到了有计划的生产和推销，适当地克服了合作社业务中的盲目性。并通过合作社直接和生产者建立了连系，减少了市场争购，起了稳定物价的作用，也减少了商业资本封小生产者的剥削；加强了各社与公私营之间的连系；对基层社的业务也起了领导与推动的作用。同时由于是大宗交换，也减少了许多人力的消耗和运费的开支。
    根据这次订立合同的经验，今后尚须注意下列各点：
    一、在订立合同之前，必须将货品的成本、运费、伤耗、包装费用、生产情况、物价趋势及自己的力量等方面，作比较详细周密的估计，不应丝毫马虎。
    二、合同内容必须明确、详细、周到、如时间、数量、质量、交换地点、装卸车费、小脚费、伤耗等，规定清楚，明确责任；合同文字必须明确、肯定、通俗、不能模棱两可，以减少不必要的损失。如原冀中合作社与察哈尔合作社的纱布交换合同，因没有具体规定纱的质量，结果交换来的是次纱，影响了冀中土布在群众中的威信。又如该省和黑龙江合作社交换的玉米，由于合同上没有写明在那里交货，以致卸货延期，双方推诿责任，引起许多可以避免的损失。
    三、要合同执行的顺利，在订立合同时必须掌握两利原则，特别是合作社与合作社之间，以及公营企业之间，必须一本互助互利方针，克服狭隘的本位主义。并应克服商人的虚伪作风，这是很重要的。
