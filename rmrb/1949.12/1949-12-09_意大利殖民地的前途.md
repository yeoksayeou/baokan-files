　　The Future of the Italian Colonies
　　Bolikov 作 Zhang Wenlian 译

　　Why is it that the issue of the former Italian colonies, now on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly, remains unresolved despite repeated discussions at the United Nations?
　　Yelimeyev asked

　　The reason why the issue of the former Italian colonies remains unresolved to this day lies in the position adopted by the ruling figures of the United Kingdom and the United States; behind their plans, they intend to divide the Italian colonies among the imperialist robbers.

　　British representative to the United Nations, McNair, told the General Assembly's Political Committee that Libya could achieve independence in just three or five years. American representative Jessup also said three or four years. Both did their best to explain that Libya and other former Italian colonies were not yet able to exercise self-government and needed "a longer period of guidance and political experience." Needless to say, they assume that their government is the only one that can provide such "guidance."

　　All this feigned "concern" for the interests of the people of the former Italian colonies has been exposed for what it is. Let us merely recall the policies followed by the British and American governments, which have already taken control of these regions. The United Kingdom unilaterally established an "independent" Cyrenaica (in North Africa, northeast Libya – translator's note), ruled by the British official Sanussi. And the United States is busy turning the former Italian colonies into its own military bases.

　　The former Italian colonies have become the object of despicable behind-the-scenes bargaining at the United Nations. The Burrows newspaper Agence reports that U.S. Ambassador Dunn told Prime Minister Gasperi in the second half of September that the United States was prepared to support Italy's claim to rule Somaliland and Eritrea in exchange for U.S. control of certain parts of these colonies. These facts themselves fully expose the hypocritical arguments put forward by the representatives of the Anglo-American bloc.

　　But what is the real reason for the fierce Anglo-American opposition to granting independence to the former Italian colonies? The reason was revealed by the London Times, which urged Britain and the United States to take note, saying that they could not withdraw all their troops from Africa because that would weaken their position in the Western Mediterranean.

　　This is what the mouthpiece of the City of London has admitted without reservation: the actions of the representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States show that they are not acting in the interests of the local residents, but in order to perpetuate the current colonial regime that they have illegally seized in the colonial territories, and to turn these territories into their military springboards.

　　In contrast to this reckless policy is the clear position of the Soviet Union. The Soviet delegation has submitted the following proposal to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly:

　　Grant Libya independence immediately, and withdraw all foreign troops within three months.

　　Eritrea and Italian Somaliland should be granted independence in five years' time, and should be administered for the time being by a trustee designated by the Trusteeship Council, who will work in consultation with a consultative committee composed of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, Italy, Abyssinia, and one European resident and two representatives of the local people.

　　This decision is fully in line with the interests of the people of the former Italian colonies and the lofty principles of the United Nations Charter. Only by adopting the Soviet proposal can we put an end to the behind-the-scenes dealing policy of the imperialists around the issue of the former Italian colonies, which are being used by the Western powers as a pawn in their reckless gambling. Only the solution proposed by the Soviet Union can lead the people of those lands to freedom and independent development.

　　意大利殖民地的前途
    伯利科夫  作  张文涟  译
    为什么现在列入联合国大会议程的关于前意大利殖民地的问题，虽然已在联合国一再讨论过，但仍然未得解决？
    叶利墨也夫问
    前意大利殖民地问题到今天还未得解决的原因，在于英美两国统治人物所采取的立场；在他们的计划后面，他们意图将意大利殖民地由帝国主义强盗们瓜分。
    联全国英国代表麦克纳尔告大会政治委员会说，利比亚仅在三年或五年之内，就可获得独立。美国代表耶塞普也说要三年或四年。他们二人都尽量说明利比亚和其他前意大利殖民地还不能实行自治，而需要“一个较长时期的指导和政治经验”。不用说，他们假定他们的政府就是惟一能给与那种“指导”的政府。
    所有这些假作的对前意大利殖民地人民利益的“关心”，已为真象所揭穿。让我们仅仅回忆一下英美政府所遵循的政策，它已经控制了这些地区。英国片面的建立起一个“独立的”赛雷奈伊卡（在北非洲，利比亚东北。——译注）由英国的官吏圣努西来统治着。而美国亦正在忙着将前意大利殖敢地变为自己的军事基地。
    前意大利殖民地已经成为联合国幕后卑鄙的讨价还价的标的。伯罗斯报纸阿加克报导说，美国大使顿恩在九月下半月告诉首相加斯贝里说，美国准备支持义大利统治索马利兰及厄立特利亚两地的要求，以换得美国控制这些殖民地的某些部分。这些事实本身充分揭露了英美集团代表们所提出的虚伪论点。
    可是，英美激烈反对给予前意大利殖民地独立，其真实原因究竟何在呢？这理由被伦敦泰晤土报透露出来了，该报怂恿英、美、引起注意，说她们不能从非洲撤出他们所有的军队，因为那会削弱她们在西地中海的地位。
    这就是伦敦城的代言人所自认不讳的：英美的代表们的行动，表现了他们不是为了当地居民的利益，而是为了想使他们在殖民土地上非法抢夺来的现行殖民政权永续下去，并且返这些领土变成他们的军事跳板。
    与此冒险政策相反的是苏联的明确的立场。苏联代表团已将下面的提议送交联合国大会政治委员会：
    立即给予利比亚以独立，所有外国军队于三个月内撤出。
    厄立特利亚与义属索马利兰在五年后给予独立，目前暂由托管委员会指定托管人管理，他将协同谘询委员会进行工作；咨询委员会是由联合国安理会常任理事国、意大利、阿比西尼亚以及该地一个欧洲居民和两个当地人民的代表所组成的。
    这一决定完全符合前意大利殖民地人民的利益与联合国宪章的崇高原则。只有采取苏联的提议才能结束帝国主义者围绕前意大利殖民地问题而进行的后台交易政策，那些殖民地正被西方列强用作他们进行卤莽赌博的赌本。只有苏联提议的解决办法，才能使那些土地的人民走向自由与独立的发展。
