Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 24th: Kunming Provincial Middle School principals and all teachers, students, and staff sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on the 11th of this month. The telegram began: "The people's century of thought took root in Yunnan very early. The schools, influenced by this trend, took the lead in advocating it. Unfortunately, soon after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, a political upheaval ensued. Tens of thousands of Yunnan's brave sons were sent to their deaths in the Northeast, a heart-wrenching tragedy that made it difficult for the people to live in peace. Furthermore, bandits like Du Zhongming, Guan Linzheng, Huo Kuizhang, and He Shaozhou increased their oppression, with secret agents running rampant and heavy troops watching menacingly. Thus, the blood of the 'December 1st' four martyrs flowed, and the heads of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were severed. People resisted hunger and starvation in search of a life they could not find, and were accused of loving their country while supporting America and Japan. Those in charge were subjected to humiliation, teachers were frequently arrested, and students were brutally persecuted, resulting in the deaths and disappearances of countless teachers, students, and staff. All of this was the result of the Kuomintang reactionaries' bandit gang indulging their selfish desires, spreading their poisonous flames, and making enemies of the people."

The telegram continued: "Director Lu, following the will of the twelve million people of Yunnan, broke away from the Kuomintang reactionary government on the 10th of this month, liberated the entire province, and joined the people's camp. It is foreseeable that the bandit gang will suffer complete destruction, the great cause of liberation will be accomplished, the country will embark on a smooth path, and the meaning of the people's century will be restored. In addition to self-examination and intensified learning, we are adopting a rigorous attitude to assist in stabilizing the local situation now, and will welcome and comfort the Liberation Army in the future with extremely excited feelings."

　　昆明省立中等学校师生
  　电毛主席朱总司令致敬
    要加紧学习迎接解放大军
    【新华社北京二十四日电】昆明各省立中等学校校长及全体师生员工于本月十一日致电毛主席、朱总司令致敬。电文首称：“人民世纪思潮，云南植根甚早。学校承风，乃有先倡。不幸抗战甫终，政变踵起。滇南健儿，送死于东北者数千巨万，剜心刻骨之惨，使生民难安。而杜众明、关麟征、霍揆彰、何绍周诸匪动加钳制，特务横行，重兵虎视。于是‘一二一’四烈士之血流，李与闻两先生之头断。乃至抗饥巨饿，以求活而无生，反美扶日，因爱国而有罪。负责者要遭屈辱，执教者频见逮捕，学习者横被摧残，于是师生、员工之死亡失踪者何止千万。此皆国民党反动派匪帮肆其私心，张其毒焰，与民为仇之结果。”。继称：“卢主任遵循云南一千二百万人民之意志，自本月十日起脱离国民党反动派政府，解放全省地方，参加人民阵营。行见匪帮遭受彻底毁灭，解放大业之成可待，国家步入坦途，人民世纪之义复张。同人等除自我检讨，加紧学习外，正以检严肃之态度，协助安定地方于现在，并将以至兴奋之心情，迎慰解放大军于将来。”
