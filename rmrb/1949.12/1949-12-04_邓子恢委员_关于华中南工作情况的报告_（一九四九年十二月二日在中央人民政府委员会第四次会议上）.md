Committee Chairman Mao, esteemed committee members, and distinguished guests:

　　This is my first time attending a meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. I would like to take this opportunity to report to you on the opening up and general work situation in Central and Southern China, primarily focusing on the four provinces of Central China.

　　The Central and Southern China liberated area had significant guerrilla zones as early as the Anti-Japanese War. Later, it was occupied by the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the autumn of 1947, the Liu-Deng and Chen-Su large armies launched a counter-offensive and re-established the area, which was then called the Central Plains Liberated Area. It governed the vast region west of the Jinpu Railway, east of the Daba Mountains, south of the Yellow River, and north of the Yangtze River, including Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Shaanxi. At the beginning of this year, the Military Commission redeployed troops nationwide, and in April and May, the Fourth Field Army marched south to fight, expanding it into the present-day Central and Southern China, encompassing the six provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, with a population of over 136 million. In terms of population, it is the largest administrative region in the country. However, in terms of the foundation of work, except for Henan and the area north of the Yangtze River in Hubei, which have two years of history, the vast majority are new areas. Therefore, since June, our central task has been to focus on eliminating the remaining enemies and taking over new areas at the front, and to focus on suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, and restoring production in the rear. After half a year of arduous struggle, these tasks have been basically completed.

　　Regarding the elimination of remaining enemies: Thanks to the valiant fighting of the People's Liberation Army, the enthusiastic support of the broad masses, the close cooperation of friendly forces, the uprising and response of Generals Cheng Qian and Chen Mingren, and especially Chairman Mao's correct plan for encircling and annihilating the White bandits, Song Xilian has now been largely defeated. After the White bandit troops were annihilated in the Hengyang and Guinan campaigns, losing their main forces of the 171st, 172nd, 176th, and 138th Divisions, as well as part of the reorganized 7th Army, they have lost their combat effectiveness. It is estimated that the war in Central and Southern China will soon end, and the entire territory of Guangxi will be liberated. The remaining enemy on Hainan Island will not be difficult to eliminate next year.

　　Regarding the takeover of new areas: Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces are nearing completion, Guangdong has taken over most of the area, and Guangxi is just beginning the process. In this regard, due to the vast size of the new areas in Central China, our weak working foundation, and the shortage of cadres, it is not easy to spread out our efforts. The heavy burden of war service (requiring grain and labor) is also an extremely difficult task for us in the past six months. Our solution to this difficulty, in addition to sending a portion of the main force to be localized to establish local armed forces, assigning veteran cadres as the core, and establishing party and government organizations at all levels, is to extensively absorb local intellectuals, boldly utilize former township and Bao personnel, and convene peasant representative meetings and representatives' meetings from all walks of life in a timely manner. Only through them can we connect with the broad masses and gain their support, allowing many tasks to gradually unfold. For example, raising grain is an extremely difficult task. This year, the grain requisition targets for each province are very large, and the needs are very urgent. However, in places where local intellectuals participate, Baojia personnel are boldly utilized, and representative meetings are combined with mass mobilization, the grain requisition tasks have been successfully completed; otherwise, the opposite will occur.

　　Regarding the suppression of bandits and opposition to local bullies, the focus is on the old areas of Henan and Hubei, followed by the new areas. Due to the long-term exploitation and oppression of the Kuomintang's feudal rule and the resulting bankruptcy of the countryside, Central China has historically had many soldiers and bandits, especially in western Henan, western Hunan, and western Hubei. These bandits colluded with local landlords and bullies and Kuomintang secret agents, forming the most vicious ruling force in the countryside. In addition, after the Kuomintang's military defeat last year, they adopted the so-called "guerrilla policy behind enemy lines," and the bandits and bullies in various places became even more rampant. This caused the greatest harm to the front-line operations and rear production. Therefore, starting in June of this year, we were determined to suppress bandits in the rear and overthrow the landlords and bullies who colluded with the bandits. The common people called these bullies "the Zhuge Liangs of the bandits." After nine months of joint efforts by the party, government, army, and people, the bandits have now been completely eliminated in Henan province. Not only are there no organized bandits, but even scattered bandits are gone. Hubei, except for the newly opened southwestern Hubei, has also largely been cleared. Although Jiangxi has only been liberated for half a year, there are no organized bandits in the entire province, except for individual areas bordering Fujian, Guangdong, and Hunan. The hidden scattered bandits are being cleared up. Hunan has adopted a policy of simultaneously clearing and incorporating bandits. Currently, there are no bandits in northern, eastern, and central Hunan, and the bandits in western and southern Hunan will soon be eliminated. This is a major event in Central and Southern China and a historical miracle. Many people do not believe that bandits can be eliminated, nor do they believe that the results can be achieved so quickly. In fact, it is not surprising. As long as the party, government, army, and people cooperate closely, as long as military, political, and economic measures are carried out simultaneously, and as long as the Kuomintang reactionary regime and bullies who harbor and create bandits are overthrown, it is not impossible to eliminate bandits. According to Henan's experience: The first phase should focus on military encirclement and suppression, combined with political offensives, with the aim of eliminating organized bandits and disrupting bandit strongholds. The second phase should focus on political offensives, combined with military clearing and suppression and mass mobilization, with the aim of disintegrating the bandit masses and eliminating scattered bandits. The third phase should focus on mass struggle, with the aim of punishing bandit leaders, overthrowing bullies, implementing rent and interest reduction, and improving people's livelihoods to eliminate the source of bandits. Of course, this is still a preliminary method. To fundamentally prevent the resurgence of bandits, it will only be possible after the land reform is thoroughly completed.

　　Regarding the restoration of production and economic prosperity: After taking over, we first paid attention to restoring urban industry and handicraft production. In accordance with Chairman Mao's policy of attending to all quarters, we implemented a policy of considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital. At the same time, we paid attention to promoting internal and external exchanges and mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, so that agricultural and industrial products could circulate normally. This requires many specific measures, such as effectively protecting freedom of trade, establishing tax regulations, smoothing transportation, stabilizing currency values, strengthening capital turnover, and eliminating road pass restrictions, especially overcoming the empiricism and old methods used by veteran cadres during the Anti-Japanese War (such as controlling foreign trade). After six months of various measures, urban industry and commerce have gradually recovered, and the market has gradually prospered. Shipping on the Yangtze River has been unblocked. The Yuehan and Xianggui railways can be fully opened to traffic before the end of the year. Agricultural production in the countryside has also proceeded as usual. This year, Central China suffered extremely severe floods, but because disaster relief work was combined with mass movements, the general harvest still reached about 60-70%. Currently, wheat has been sown in Henan. According to the report of the Henan Provincial People's Government, Henan has basically eliminated wasteland. In the new areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, because rent and interest reduction were not carried out in a timely manner, the masses did not know when land reform would be carried out, nor did they know who their land would be distributed to. This caused anxiety among both local officials and farmers, affecting production enthusiasm and unwillingness to apply large amounts of fertilizer. Now, the double reduction regulations have been announced and implemented to mobilize the masses, while maintaining the original tenancy and loan relationships to stabilize production enthusiasm.

　　Finally, regarding financial work, we fully support the central government's policy of unified planning and distribution, as well as the draft budget for next year and the plan for issuing public bonds, and resolutely complete the tasks assigned by the Central Finance and Economics Committee to Central China for grain requisition, taxation, and the promotion of public bonds. Of course, this task is very large, and there are indeed many difficulties, but I believe that it is necessary, indispensable, and also possible to complete. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the enthusiastic support of the people of all strata, and the joint efforts of all working comrades, I believe that we will be able to complete this task. However, in the process of implementation, we may encounter various intentional or unintentional obstructions. Therefore, I also hope that all committee members and comrades from various parties will jointly conduct publicity and explanations to the people of all strata across the country to reduce the difficulties we encounter in implementation. This is my sincere hope.

　　邓子恢委员
    关于华中南工作情况的报告
    （一九四九年十二月二日在中央人民政府委员会第四次会议上）
    毛主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    我是第一次来出席中央人民政府委员会的，乘此机会谨将华中南主要是华中四省开辟情形及工作概况，向各位报告一下。
    华中南这个解放区早在抗战期间就有很大的游击区，后被国民党反动派所占领，到了一九四七年秋间，刘邓、陈粟大军，举行反攻，又重新开辟，当时称为中原解放区，管辖津浦路以西、大巴山以东、黄河以南、长江以北包括鄂豫皖陕广大地区。今年年初军委对全国兵力重新部署，四五月间四野部队南下作战，才扩大成为今天的华中南，计包括湘、鄂、赣、豫、粤、桂六省，人口约在一万万三千六百万以上。照人口来说是全国最大的行政区，但照工作基础来说，除了河南及湖北长江以北地区有二年历史而外，其余绝大部分是新区。因此，从六月以来，我们的中心工作，便是前方以消灭残敌，接管新区为主；后方以剿匪反霸，恢复生产为主。经过半年来的艰苦斗争，这几个工作，到现在止，基本上已经完成了任务。
    关于消灭残敌方面：由于解放军的奋勇作战，广大人民之热烈拥护，各方友军之密切配合，程潜、陈明仁两将军之起义响应，特别是毛主席对白匪大包围作战计划之正确，现在宋希濂已大部溃灭，白匪部队经过衡阳及此次桂南战役歼灭其主力一七一、一七二、一七六、一三八各师及重组的七军之一部后，已丧失战斗力。估计华中南战争不久可结束，广西全境，即可解放。剩下海南岛的敌歼兵败将明年亦不难加以歼灭。
    关于接管新区方面：现在湘鄂赣三省已接近完毕，广东接管大部，广西正开始按管。这方面，由于华中新区太大，我工作基础不强，干部又少，摊子不易摆开，而战争勤务（要粮要夫）又异常繁重，确是我们半年来最感困难的工作。我们解决此困难的办法，除了派出一部主力地方化，以建立地方武装，指定老干部作核心，建立各级党政机构外，便是大量吸收当地知识分子，与大胆利用旧乡保人员，并适时召开农民代表会议与各界代表会议，经过他们去与广大群众取得联系，得到群众的拥护，许多工作才能逐步展开。譬如筹粮，是一件极困难工作，今年各省征粮数目又很大，而需要又非常迫切，但凡是有当地知识分子参加，大胆利用保甲，而又经过了代表会议与动员群众相结合的地方，征粮任务，都顺利完成，否则适得其反。
    关于剿匪反霸方面，重心在河南与湖北之老区，其次是新区。由于国民党封建统治长期剥削压迫，农村破产的结果，华中各地，历来是兵多匪多，特别是豫西、湘西、鄂西等地，更为严重。这些土匪与当地豪绅恶霸及国民党特务互相勾结，三位一体，便形成乡村中最凶恶的统治势力。加之国民党自去年军事失败后采取了所谓“敌后游击政策”，各地匪霸乃更形猖獗。这对前方作战后方生产，为害最大，因此我们从今年六月间即下决心在后方剿匪，并打倒与土匪勾结之豪绅恶霸。这些恶霸，老百姓称之为“土匪的诸葛亮”。经过九个月来党政军民的共同努力，现在河南全省已肃清了土匪，不仅没有股匪，连散匪也没有了。湖北除新开辟之鄂西南外，亦已大部肃清。江西虽解放仅半年，但除与闽粤湘交界之个别地区外，全省已无股匪，隐藏之散匪正在清剿中。湖南则采取清剿与收编同时并进政策，现湘北、湘东、湘中已无土匪，湘西、湘南的土匪亦已不久可以肃清。这是华中南一件大事，也是历史上一件奇迹。有许多人不相信土匪可以肃清，不相信收效如此之速，其实并不奇怪，只要党政军民密切配合，只要军事、政治、经济三方面并进，只要把包庇与制造土匪之国民党反动政权与恶霸打倒，剿灭土匪并不是不可能的。据河南经验：第一期应以军事围剿为主，结合政治攻势，目的在剿灭股匪，打乱匪巢。第二期以政治攻势为主，结合军事清剿与发动群众，目的在瓦解匪众，肃清散匪。第三期以群众斗争为主，目的在惩办匪首，打倒恶霸，实行减租减息，改善民生，以杜匪源。当然这还是初步办法，要从根本上杜绝土匪再生，只有在彻底完成土地改革以后才有可能。
    关于恢复生产繁荣经济方面，我们在接管之后，首先注意恢复城市工业与手工业生产。遵照毛主席四面八方政策，实行公私兼顾，劳资两利，同时注意促进内外交流与城乡互助，农产品与工业品能够正常流通。这方面要有许多具体办法，如确实保护交易自由，厘定税则，畅顺运输，稳定币值，加强资金周转，取消路条限制等，尤其要克服老干部在抗战时期沿用下来的经验主义和老一套办法（如统制对外贸易等）。经过半年来的各种措施，现在各城市工商业已逐渐恢复，市面逐渐繁荣。长江航运已经畅通。粤汉湘桂两条铁路，年前可以全线通车。乡村中的农业生产，亦已照常进行。今年华中水灾，异常严重，但因救灾工作与群众运动相结合，一般收成仍达六七成左右。目前河南麦子已下种。据河南省人民政府报告，河南已基本消灭了荒地。湘鄂赣新区，因为未及时进行减租减息，群众不知何时进行土地改革，不知自己土地分给谁人，因此曾引起地方与农民双方不安，影响生产情绪，不肯大量下肥。现已公布双减条例，发动群众实行，同时保持原有租佃与借贷关系，以安定生产情绪。
    最后关于财政工作，我们完全拥护中央统筹统支方针与明年收支概算及公债之发行计划，并坚决完成中央财委给华中征粮、税收及推销公债的任务。当然这个任务是很大的，而且确有很多困难，但我认为这是必要的，不可少的，而且也有可能完成。在毛主席与中央人民政府正确领导，各阶层人民的热诚拥护与全体工作同志的共同努力之下，我相信一定能够完成这个任务的。但在执行过程中，可能要遭遇到各种有意无意的阻挠，因此还希望各委员与各党派同志共同向全国各阶层人民进行宣传解释，以减少我们在执行中的困难。这是我个人所诚恳希望的。
