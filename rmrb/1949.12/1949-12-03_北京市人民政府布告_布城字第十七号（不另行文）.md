A "Collection Promotion Committee" was also organized to assess the tax units for each industry, and this was approved and promulgated by this government. Now, based on the results of investigations and research by this government's Tax Bureau and exchanges of views with the industrial and commercial sectors, in order to take into account the affordability of various industrial and commercial businesses, it is specifically stipulated that the price of millet per catty shall be 600 yuan. The payment period is from December 6th to 25th. The price of millet will remain unchanged until the 15th. If the price of millet rises, it will be adjusted according to the market price from the 16th onwards. It is hoped that all industrial and commercial businesses will promptly pay in the spirit of building a new capital. Those who fail to pay within the time limit will be punished in accordance with regulations. This proclamation is hereby issued!
