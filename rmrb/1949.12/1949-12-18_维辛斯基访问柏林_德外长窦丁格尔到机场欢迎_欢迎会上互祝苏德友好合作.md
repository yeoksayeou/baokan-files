Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th: Vyshinsky, the Soviet Foreign Minister, visited Berlin at his invitation on his way back to the country from New York. According to a TASS dispatch: Vyshinsky flew to Berlin from Paris on the 14th. German Foreign Minister Doudinger, who came to the airport to welcome him, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic, listing Vyshinsky's significant contributions in external struggles, and particularly thanking Vyshinsky for putting forward constructive suggestions and guiding the meeting in the Paris Four Foreign Ministers' Conference this summer, so that it clearly recognized the necessity for Germany to take the initiative. "The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is part of this initiative. If the establishment of the German Democratic Republic became possible, thus creating the starting point for a democratic solution to the German question, it is to a large extent due to your contribution. All the sincere patriotic forces of the German people are engaged in the struggle for a unified, independent, democratic and peace-loving Germany. In Marshal Stalin's historical statement on the founding of the German Democratic Republic, a high appraisal was given to our struggle, and this appraisal gave us strength and confidence." Doudinger concluded by saying: "The Soviet Union has consistently represented and defended the national interests of the German people. In this regard, you have played a decisive role. Therefore, there is ample reason today to put forward a slogan: Eternal friendship with the Soviet people!"

Vyshinsky said in his reply: "I am very pleased to have the opportunity to visit the German capital. No matter how others call other cities 'capital', Berlin was, is, and will always be the capital of Germany." Vyshinsky pointed out: "The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is a major historical event of great significance for the future destiny of Germany and the German people. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic and its government laid the foundation for a unified and peace-loving Germany. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is the completion of the process announced as early as the Potsdam Conference, which set the goal of allowing the German people to build on a democratic and peaceful basis. The Soviet Union and the Soviet government, following the foreign policy of the great Stalin towards the German people and other peace-loving people, have given and will continue to give full cooperation."

In a statement to the press, Vyshinsky pointed out: "The Soviet Union and the German people have all the potential to successfully carry out this great historical task of winning peace in Europe." Vyshinsky formally met with German President Pieck, Deputy Prime Ministers Ulbricht, Kasner, and Nuschke (Prime Minister Grotewohl is currently ill), and Foreign Minister Doudinger, and flew away from Berlin on the 16th.

    德外长窦丁格尔到机场欢迎
    欢迎会上互祝苏德友好合作
    【新华社北京十七日电】苏联外交部长维辛斯基自纽约返国途中，曾应邀访问柏林。综合塔斯社消息：维辛斯基系于十四日自巴黎飞抵柏林，赴机场欢迎的德外长窦丁格尔代表德意志民主共和国临时政府致辞欢迎，历举维辛斯基在外部斗争中的重大功绩，特别感谢维辛斯基在今夏巴黎四外长会中提出建设性的建议，指导会议的进行，使其明确地承认了德国有采取主动性的必要。“德意志民主共和国的成立，就是这一主动性的一部分。如果说德意志民主共和国的成立成为可能，并从而创造了民主解决德国问题的起点，那么，这在很大的程度上，是出于你的供献。德国人民的一切真诚爱国的力量，都在从事于争取统一、独立、民主与爱好和平的德国的斗争。在斯大林大元帅关于德意志民主共和国成立的历史性声明中，对我们的这一斗争给了很高的评价，这种评价给了我们力量和信心。”窦丁格尔最后称：“苏联一贯地代表和保卫德国人民的民族利益。在这一点上，你担任了有决定性作用的一部分。为此，今天有充分的理由提出一个口号：与苏联人民永远友好！”
    维辛斯基致答辞称：“我有机会得以访问德国首都，至感快慰，不管别人如何把其他城市叫做‘首都’，但柏林过去是、现在是、将来还是德国的首都。”维辛斯基指出：“德意志民主共和国的成立是一桩对德国及德国人民未来的命运具有巨大意义的重大历史性事件。德意志民主共和国及其政府的成立、奠定了统一与爱好和平的德国的基础。德意志民主共和国的成立乃是早在波茨坦会议时所曾宣布的程序之完成，该会议定下了让德国人民在民主与和平的基础上进行建设的目标。苏联及苏联政府遵从伟大斯大林对德国人民以及其他爱好和平人民的外交政策，曾经而且将继续给以充分合作。”
    维辛斯基在向报界发表的声明中指出：“苏联与德国人民拥有一切潜力，得以成功地执行这个获得欧洲和平胜利的伟大的历史任务。”维辛斯基正式拜会了德总统皮克、副总理乌布利希、卡斯纳、努舍克（总理格罗提渥现在病中），外长窦丁格尔诸人，而于十六日飞离柏林。
