　　Tianjin Suburbs and Tianjin Special District Counties
  　Achieve Success in Production for Self-Salvation
    Life for 20,000 Disaster Victims in Wen'an and Other Counties is Guaranteed
    [Reported by this newspaper] The masses in the suburbs of Tianjin and Wen'an, Dacheng, Jinghai, Baodi and other counties in the Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province have actively engaged in production for self-salvation and have achieved significant results. In order to strengthen the leadership of the masses' production for self-salvation, the Tianjin Municipal Suburbs held a special discussion on this issue at the Farmers' Congress on October 13. At the same time, a Production for Self-Salvation Steering Committee was established, and production for self-salvation guidance groups were established in various disaster areas and villages. More than 300 cadres at all levels were transferred to vigorously lead the masses in production for self-salvation. By mid-November, 404 production groups and one cooperative had been established in 36 administrative villages in six disaster areas in the suburbs of the city; 4,188 people participated in production. In order to help the masses solve the financial difficulties in production for self-salvation, the government has successively issued loans of 52.54 million yuan and 41,896 jin of relief grain. There are 17 kinds of production methods, including transportation, fishing, straw rope making, and shipping. Transportation alone can earn 20,000 yuan per person per day. In addition, 1,950 disaster victims were organized to participate in the New Kaihe River dredging project. In 20 days, in addition to earning a set of digging tools per person, they earned an average of 50 jin of rice. Experience has shown that organizing the masses to produce for self-salvation must start from the local original production base and from various small-scale productions. Any attempt to only look at the big picture and not the small, to solve the lives of all disaster victims at once, or to simply rely on loans, will fail.
    In Wen'an, Dacheng, Jinghai, Baodi and other counties in the Tianjin Special District, since the representatives of all walks of life decided to carry out saltpeter production, after ten days, according to incomplete statistics, 483 villages and 32,496 people in the four counties have participated in production. More than 1,388,000 jin of saltpeter have been produced, which can be exchanged for 437,000 jin of millet, which can solve the lives of more than 20,000 disaster victims. Village cadres in various regions have taken the lead in leading the masses to engage in saltpeter production with exemplary actions and have achieved results. For example, Han Gaoyun, secretary of the Seventh District Committee of Jinghai County, and Hao Fuzhen, director of the Women's Federation, mobilized the masses to boil saltpeter in the Qi Xiaowangzhuang area. Because the masses were not accustomed to it and did not believe that the soil quality of the village could boil saltpeter, after the two comrades Han and Hao personally picked up firewood and boiled saltpeter, 58 households and 310 people immediately organized to participate in the boiling of saltpeter, and it was quickly extended to 13 nearby villages. The representatives of the Chen Guantuan Village All-Circles Representative Conference in the county immediately personally experimented with boiling saltpeter after returning to the village after the meeting. In six days, they led more than 200 households to participate in this production. The county can produce a total of 2 million jin of saltpeter this winter. In order to solve the sales problem, Baodi has directly signed contracts with nitrate factories in Tianjin and Tangshan; Dacheng has also established production and sales relations with Shanghai.

　　天津郊区及天津专区各县
  　生产自救获得成绩
    文安等县两万灾民生活已有保障
    【本报讯】天津郊区及河北天津专区的文安、大城、静海、宝坻等县群众，积极生产自救，已获重要成绩。天津市郊为加强对群众生产自救的领导，在十月十三日的农代会上，曾专门讨论了此项问题，并于同时建立了生产自救指导委员会，在各灾区、村建立生产自救指导小组，并抽调各级干部三百余人，大力领导群众生产自救工作。到十一月中旬，在市郊六个灾区三十六个行政村中，已建立起生产小组四百零四个，一个合作社；参加生产群众达四千一百八十八人。为帮助群众解决生产自救中的资金困难，政府曾先后发放贷款五千二百五十四万元，赈粮四万一千八百九十六斤。生产办法有运输、打鱼、打草绳、船运等十七种，仅运输一项每人每日即可赚二万元。此外，并组织灾民一千九百五十人参加疏浚新开河工程，二十天中，除每人赚一套挖土工具外，平均赚米五十斤。经验证明，组织群众生产自救，必须从当地原有生产基础和从多方面小型生产着手，任何看大不看小，企图一下子解决所有灾民生活问题，或单纯依靠贷款，都是要失败的。
    在天津专区的文安、大城、静海、宝坻等县，自各界代表会议决议开展硝业生产以来，经过十天时间，据不完全统计，四个县已有四百八十三个村，三万二千四百九十六人参加生产，已产硝一百三十八万八千余斤，可换小米四十三万七千斤，约解决两万以上灾民的生活。各地区村干部以模范行动带领群众进行熬硝生产，已取得成绩。如静海县七区区委韩高云，妇联会主任郝富真，到齐小王庄一带发动群众熬硝，因群众没有习惯，不相信该村土质可以熬硝，经过韩、郝二同志亲自拾柴熬出硝后，立刻就有群众五十八户，三百一十人组织起来参加熬硝，并很快就推广到附近十三村。该县陈官屯村各界代表会代表，开会回村后便立即亲自试验熬硝，六天时间带起群众二百多户参加此种生产。该县今冬共可产硝二百万斤。为解决销路问题，宝坻已和天津、唐山各用硝工厂直接订立合同；大城也和上海建立了产销关系。（天津民政局通讯组、天津专区研究室李冰）
