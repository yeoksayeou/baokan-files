　　Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Achieves Results in Material Exchange
    [Beijing News] Since the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative launched material exchange work with various regions in May of this year, it has played a significant role in connecting urban and rural trade and promoting material exchange. As of the end of November, the cooperative had purchased a total of 12,452,800 jin of grain, more than 26,300 bags of wheat flour, more than 15,000 pieces of cloth, and more than 140 pieces of cotton yarn from various regions. In addition, there were industrial products such as kerosene and matches, as well as mountain products and fur. In particular, the purchase of grain helped stabilize prices in Beijing and met the needs of more than 250,000 members in the city. At the same time, it also solved the difficulties faced by farmers in the suburbs of Beijing in planting wheat in the autumn and the shortage of late-season seeds in Cangxian County and other areas in the Bohai region. The cooperative organized procurement teams in the Northwest, Southwest, and Northeast along trade routes in July to purchase materials in a planned manner. In addition, trade relations have also been established with Tianjin, Shanghai, Jinan and other places. The main shortcomings in this stage of material exchange work are blindness. For example, the coarse cloth sent to the Northwest lacked overall packaging and did not meet the local people's habit of using cloth, resulting in poor sales. Some goods did not sell well, and the spirit of selling even without profit was not implemented, which affected the turnover of funds.

　　京供销合作总社
    交流物资获成绩
    【北京讯】京市供销合作总社自本年五月间与各地展开物资交流工作以来，对沟通城乡贸易、促进物资交流方面，起了不小的作用。截至十一月底，该社从各地共收购粮食一千二百四十五万二千八百余斤，麦粉二万六千三百余袋，布匹一万五千余件，棉纱一百四十余件，此外还有煤油、火柴等工业品和山货、皮毛等物品。特别是粮食的采购，帮助了京市物价的稳定，供应了市内二十五万余社员的需要，同时还解决了京市郊区农民秋季种麦以及渤海区沧县等地晚田种子缺乏的困难。该社从七月按贸易路线组织了西北、西南、东北三路采购小组，有计划的采购物资。此外与天津、上海、济南等地也建立了贸易关系。在这一阶段物资交流工作中尚存在的缺点主要是盲目性，譬如往西北发去的土布缺乏整庄，因不切合当地群众用布习惯而推销不畅。有些货物销路不畅，也未能贯彻宁可无利也要抛售的精神，而影响了资金的周转。
