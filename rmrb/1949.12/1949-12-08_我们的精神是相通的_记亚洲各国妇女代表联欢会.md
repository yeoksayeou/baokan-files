　　Our Spirits are Connected
    —A Record of the Friendship Gathering of Women Representatives from Asian Countries
    Chen Ji
    Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, entertained the representatives from various countries who came to Beijing to attend the Asian Women's Conference with a joyful heart. She stood beside Mrs. Hansa Mehta and said loudly, "Although we have not met in the past, our spirits are connected; although our languages are mutually incomprehensible, our cause is common." In a simple room, more than two hundred women representatives and guests sat together, asking each other's names and talking about the women's liberation cause in their respective countries. Women from the imperialist countries of Britain and the United States, seeing women representatives from various oppressed colonial countries, shook hands and embraced enthusiastically, inquiring about each other's lives and struggles with concern. When Mrs. Paul Robeson heard the two Indian women representatives sing the Indian national anthem, she swayed her hands and feet with the rhythm of the song, wishing she could sing with them too. Mrs. Hansa Mehta kept telling the representatives on her left and right that French women were concerned about the struggle for the liberation of Vietnamese women. Yang Zhihua, the chairman of the gathering, said amidst the representatives' conversations: "From today onwards, our unity and friendship will be closer; from today onwards, our front against imperialism will be stronger; from today onwards, our mutual assistance will be further advanced."
    When Zhou Xingmei, a female worker from the No. 4 Textile Factory in Shanghai, reported on her heroic deeds in leading the strike the year before last, people naturally thought of the blood shed by Chinese women in their anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle over the years. When Chen Yan, a female representative of the Third Field Army of Central China, spoke about her experience of winning four medals, she told us that a girl who was only eighteen years old, on the front line of guerrilla warfare, braved the hail of bullets and rescued two wounded soldiers alone, relying on four villagers she personally mobilized, transporting them back to the hospital from twenty-five miles away. She said that such heroic spirit was "not worth being proud of, there are many more heroic people than this in our army!" Women's worker Wang Yuecun reported on the struggle of rural women in Shandong, citing many similar examples: Aunt Dong of Binhai walked seventy-five kilometers a day when she picked up stretchers at the front line, and she worked at the front line in the Yimeng Mountains for forty-five days without ever expressing fatigue with her work. Li Da Niang of Guangrao County in Bohai, although sixty years old, personally sent her three sons and one grandson to the front line. From the Jinan Campaign to the Huaihai Campaign, Shandong women transported 750 to 1,500 tons of grain to the front every day. From October last year to March this year, they made 320,000 sets of military uniforms. These labors are only the situation in Shandong Province; in the vast land of China, we can hear or see such situations everywhere. The Chinese people and Chinese women fought arduously for a long time in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year People's Liberation War, and achieved victory. This victory inspired the people and women of all oppressed countries. Mrs. Hansa Mehta said: "Your victory is a new encouragement to us, strengthening our confidence in defeating imperialism." But this victory would not have been achieved without the sympathy and help of the world democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese women representatives are deeply aware of this, and they all expressed that at this Asian Women's Representative Conference, they will humbly learn from the construction experience of various advanced countries and will introduce the experience of Chinese women's struggle in detail to the women of various colonial and semi-colonial countries.
    In the venue filled with vivid internationalist enthusiasm, following the report on the deeds of Chinese women's struggle, we also heard folk songs from the Mongolian, Korean, and Soviet representatives. Although these folk songs had their own national styles, they sounded to us like the voices of sisters from our hometown. When the Chinese women representatives led all the representatives in singing "March of the Motherland" and "The Internationale," the languages of various countries converged into a kind of sound wave: women all over the world are united together, and are forever moving forward for their common cause!

　　我们的精神是相通的
    —记亚洲各国妇女代表联欢会
    陈迹
    中华全国民主妇联副主席邓颖超带着喜悦的心情，招待着各国来京参加亚洲妇女会议的代表。她站在古久里夫的身旁，响亮地说：“尽管在过去我们没有见过面，然而我们的精神是相通的；尽管我们的言语互不相通，我们的事业却是共同的。”在一间朴素的房间里，两百多位妇女代表和来宾坐在一起，她们彼此询问着各人的名字，交谈着各个自己国家的妇女解放事业。来自英美帝国主义国家的妇女们，看见了各殖民地被压迫的国家的妇女代表，他们热情地握手拥抱，彼此关心地互相询问生活和斗争的经历。当罗伯逊夫人听到了两位印度女代表高唱印度国歌时，她随歌声的节拍，不断地摇摆着她的手足，她很想她也能和她们在一起歌唱。古久里夫人不停地向着她左右边的代表说着法国妇女关心着越南妇女解放的斗争。联欢会的主席杨之华在各代表交谈声中，说道：“从今天起，我们的团结与友谊更加紧密了；从今天起，我们反对帝国主义的阵线更强大了；从今天起，我们互相间的帮助更进一步了。”
    上海中纺四厂的女工周杏妹在报告她前年领导罢工的英勇事迹时，人们自然会想到多少年来中国妇女反帝反封建所流出的鲜血。华中第三野战军女代表陈炎说到她荣获四种奖章的经过时，告诉我们：一个才十八岁的女孩子，在游击战争的前线，冒着枪林弹雨，一个人抢救着两个受伤的战士，靠着她亲自动员的四个老乡，从二十五里路的地方，运回到医院。这种英勇精神，她说是“值不得骄傲的，我们的部队里比这更英勇的还多着哩！”妇女工作者王月村报告山东的农村妇女斗争情形，曾举了许多这样类似的例子：滨海董大姐，上前线拾担架时，一天走了七十五公里，在沂蒙山区的前线上，她工作了四十五天，从没对自己工作表示厌倦。渤海广饶县的李大娘，年虽六十，但她还亲自把她的三个儿子和一个孙子送到前线去。从济南战役到淮海战役的时间里，山东妇女每天运到前方去的粮食有七百五十吨至一千五百吨之多。从去年十月到今年三月，她们做了三十二万套军服。这些劳迹，还只是山东一省的情形；在广大的中国土地上，到处我们可以听取或看到这样的情形。中国人民和中国妇女在八年抗战和三年人民解放战争中，就是这样地长期艰苦奋斗，取得了胜利。这个胜利，鼓舞着各个被压迫国家的人民和妇女，古久里夫人说：“你们的胜利，是我们新的鼓舞，加强了我们战胜帝国主义的信心。”但是这个胜利，要是没有以苏联为首的世界民主阵营力量的同情和帮助，是不会实现的。中国妇女代表是深深知道这点的，她们都表示着在这个亚洲妇女代表会议里，将虚心学习各先进国家的建设经验，将详尽地把中国妇女斗争的经验介绍给各殖民地半殖民地国家的妇女。
    在洋溢着生动的国际主义热情的会场里，随着中国妇女斗争事迹的报告，我们又听到了蒙古代表、朝鲜代表和苏联代表的民歌，这民歌虽带有她们自己国家的民族风格，然而在我们听起来，就好象是我们家乡里的姊妹的声音。当中国妇女代表指挥着全体代表高唱“祖国进行曲”和“国际歌”时，各个国家的语言汇成为一种声浪：全世界妇女团结在一起，为她们的共同事业，永远永远地向前迈进！
