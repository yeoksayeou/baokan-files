　　Regardless of Terror and Police Persecution
    Indian Students Fight Heroically
    Komsomolskaya Pravda Indian Correspondent Report
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 21st] TASS Moscow, December 18th: The Soviet youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda recently published a dispatch from India by Mahatev Singh, describing the struggle of Indian students for freedom and democracy.
    Singh writes: This struggle is developing in an atmosphere of extreme cruelty and terror, traveled by the ruling groups in India. The Indian big bourgeoisie, closely linked with Anglo-American monopoly capital, is pursuing a reactionary policy, attacking the already low living standards of the working people, and increasing domestic unemployment, hunger, and poverty. The author points out, in narrating the increase in unemployment, the rise in the cost of living, and the extremely difficult living conditions of the working people, that the government not only lowers the living standards of the people, but also deprives them of their basic democratic freedoms. The ruling groups are doing everything possible to hinder the education of the working people. Tuition fees are constantly increasing, and primary schools have been closed.
    The reactionaries’ attack on education is part of a general offensive launched by the Indian ruling groups against the working people. Therefore, the struggle of Indian students for democratic transformation of education is inseparable from the general struggle of our people for freedom and national independence. Indian students, encouraged and led by the working class, are uniting their forces to fight for democracy against colonial oppression and the reactionary policies of the current Indian ruling groups. Indian youth, together with the people of the whole country, demand the improvement of the material conditions of the working people, the development of national industry, the expansion of education, and democratic reforms; they demand the condemnation of the policy of Anglo-American imperialists to conquer India.
    The ruling groups' answer is to persecute youth and their democratic organizations, and to intensify fascist suppression in order to drown the resistance of the working people in blood. Among the more than 25,000 democrats imprisoned in prisons and concentration camps, there are more than 1,000 students, including Burhan, the secretary of the All-India Students' Federation, and Lemasrik. The newspapers of democratic youth in India have, in effect, been banned. In Calcutta alone, twelve progressive dailies have been closed down in half a year. The repression of the ruling class has forced the All-India Students' Federation to become, in effect, an illegal organization. Hundreds of thousands of active members of the association have had to go underground.
    The ruling class in India not only directly destroys the domestic democratic movement, but also tries to divide the unity of Indian youth and students. The reactionary student organization led by the right-wing Socialist Party—the All-India Students' Congress—is engaged in activities to split the unity of youth.
    The author points out in conclusion: Vicious terror and police persecution have not crushed the freedom-loving spirit of Indian students. The students will do their utmost to strengthen the unity of the international student movement.

　　不顾恐怖和警察迫害
    印度学生英勇斗争
    共青真理报印度通讯报道
    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：苏维埃青年的机关报共青真理报顷刊载马哈捷夫·西格自印度寄来的一篇通讯，描写印度学生为争取自由与民主而进行的斗争。
    西格写道：这一斗争正在印度的统治集团所旅行的极端残酷恐怖的气氛中发展。与英美独占资本有密切联系的印度大资产阶级，正在奉行反动的政策，向劳苦人民已经很低的生活水准进攻，增加国内的失业、饥饿和贫困。作者在叙述失业的增长、生活费用的高涨及劳动人民的非常艰难的居住条件时指出，政府不仅使人民的生活水准降低，而且还剥夺他们的基本民主自由。统治集团竭力以各种办法阻碍劳苦人民受教育。学费不断提高，而初等学校都已关门。
    反动派对教育的进攻，乃是印度统治集团向劳动人民发动总攻势的一部分。因此，印度学生争取教育民主改造的斗争，与我们人民之争取自由和民族独立的总斗争是不可分开的。为工人阶级所鼓励和领导的印度学生，正在团结他们的力量，为拥护民主反对殖民地压迫和当前印度统治集团的反动政策而斗争。印度青年与全国人民一道要求改善劳苦人民的物质情况、发展民族工业、扩大教育和进行民主的改革，他们要求痛斥英美帝国主义者征服印度的政策。
    统治集团的回答却是迫害青年及其民主组织，是加紧法西斯镇压，以便把劳动人民的抵抗淹没在血泊中。关在监狱与集中营里的两万五千余名民主分子当中，有一千余名学生，全印学生联合会书记伯汉和莱玛斯里克也在内。印度民主青年的报纸，实际上已被取缔。仅在加尔各答，半年当中即封闭了十二家进步的日刊。统治阶级的镇压，已迫使全印学生联合会实际上成为非法的组织。该会数十万积极的会员不得不转入地下活动。
    印度的统治阶级不仅直接摧残国内的民主运动，而且还尽力分裂印度青年学生的团结。右翼社会党领导的反动学生组织——全印学生大会，正在进行分裂青年团结的活动。
    作者在结语中指出：恶毒的恐怖和警察迫害，并没有粉碎印度学生爱自由的精神。学生们将尽他们的全部力量加强国际学生运动的团结。
