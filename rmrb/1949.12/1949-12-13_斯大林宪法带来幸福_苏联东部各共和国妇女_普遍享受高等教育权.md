One of them, Vashanova, heads the Experimental Medical Institute and is an academician of the Kazakh Academy of Sciences.

　　Tajik women Basyotova, Layapuba, and many others are taking postgraduate courses and conducting independent scientific research.

　　In Kyrgyzstan, over three thousand Kyrgyz women have graduated from higher education institutions. They bring new culture to the people and play a prominent role in national social life.

　　In the Uzbek Republic, Uzbek women are studying in higher education schools and specialized schools. Uzbek women have proven to be highly talented participants in socialist construction.
