Why Issue the People's Victory Indexed Bonds
　　Sun Xiaocun
  　I
　　The 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds are about to be issued. In the past few days, federations of industry and commerce and other people's organizations in major cities have sent telegrams expressing their support, which demonstrates two points: First, industrialists and businessmen across the country are satisfied with the significance and measures of the government's bond issuance; second, it is not difficult to predict that the bonds will be fully subscribed within a short period after issuance. The issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds is directly aimed at making up for the fiscal deficit of the coming year, and indirectly at stabilizing prices. Moreover, the issuance is taking place at a time when the Chinese mainland is completely liberated and the national economy is transitioning from wartime to peacetime. Any industrialist or businessman with a little foresight will give the highest recognition and evaluation to all of this from the perspective of long-term interests.
    The 200 million units of bonds have been included in the fiscal revenue for 1950. This year of 1950, like 1949, which was the year when the People's Liberation War won a comprehensive and decisive victory, must also win a basic victory in overcoming economic difficulties, healing war wounds, and restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, the enthusiastic subscription of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds will play a significant role in the economic battle of 1950, not only in terms of numbers, but especially in terms of significance.
    The following points should be noted regarding the situation in 1950:
    First, there will be no more war on the Chinese mainland in 1950. This is a great thing, as it guarantees that all construction work can be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. The efforts of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party in economic construction, as well as the talents and creativity they have demonstrated in this regard, are commendable. The Northeast is an example. Since 1949, there has been no war in the Northeast, allowing it to devote all its efforts to production. Industry and commerce are gradually recovering, and prices have risen by only 80 percent. Moreover, it has made great efforts to support the rest of the country. From the example of the Northeast, we can see the prospects for the entire region within the customs in 1950. However, the absence of war does not equate to construction. The wounds and destruction left by the long-term war require a considerable period of treatment and recuperation. Therefore, although the environment will improve next year, the work will be heavy and the burden will be heavy.
    Second, the economic construction work in 1950 will be mainly restorative. For example, it is estimated that 70 percent of the investment in the industrial sector will be used in the Northeast to enable it to quickly complete the recovery process. In terms of water conservancy, the goal is to ensure that if we encounter floods as large as this year's next year, they will no longer cause such great disasters. In terms of agriculture, the requirement to increase grain production by 10 billion catties and cotton production by 4.7 million dan is also based on past levels. However, it is worth pointing out that although this is basically restorative economic construction work, it has in fact been elevated to such a stage that all investments account for 23.9 percent of the total expenditure, and almost everything has been passed through professional conferences, has been specified with concrete progress and content, and has begun to make long-term plans.
    Third, the government's biggest fiscal burden in 1950 will be to bear the living expenses of 9 million military, government, and civil service personnel. In addition, a considerable amount of expenditure will be required to liberate Taiwan, Hainan Island, Tibet, and other places. These burdens are inevitable on the road to victory. As Vice Director Bo said, "It is the responsibility of the People's Government to take care of all the old army and old public servants, provide them with a way out of life, gradually transform them, and prepare to transfer them to economic construction within one or two years, and then gradually reduce them." Especially when considering the entire social economy, consumption is the same, but when the government takes it over, although the financial burden is very heavy, it is beneficial to the social economy, because it is an organized, orderly, and limited consumption, and after transformation, it can be transformed into productive power. Here, it must be pointed out that the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all public servants are still living an extremely hard life in 1950. The reason why construction investment can account for 23.9 percent of the national budget is the result of the revolutionary army, the party leading the revolution, and the national public servants saving money and cutting expenses.
    Fourth, the disasters caused by this year's floods were very serious. In terms of the affected farmland alone, it is estimated by all parties to be as high as 100 million mu. The flow of the Yellow River during the autumn flood this year exceeded the record of 1933, and the flood level of the Yangtze River was the largest since 1931. In addition, the Kuomintang's reactionary rule neglected and delayed flood control work, long-term disrepair, and malicious destruction, resulting in such an unprecedentedly severe disaster. If this flood had occurred during the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, the loss of people's lives and property would have been ten or a hundred times greater than this year, because although the flood was so serious this year, thanks to the heroic struggle of the leaders and the broad masses in the liberated areas, they defeated the floods and overcame the difficulties not just once, nor just in one place. However, the impact of the disaster on the social economy is still quite serious, especially from now until the wheat harvest next year, how to provide relief to the disaster areas, how to restore agricultural production, how to ensure the supply of daily necessities in major cities, and how to coordinate between regions? All of this requires governments at all levels to unite with the broad masses to deal with it vigorously, whether in terms of transportation or the materials themselves.
    Fifth, there is currently a phenomenon in finance that the burden on rural areas and cities is significantly unbalanced. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the four-year War of Liberation, farmers contributed their greatest strength by providing manpower and money. In 1950, the government asked farmers to continue to bear the burden. In the estimated revenue, the public grain paid by farmers still ranks first, accounting for 41.4 percent of the total revenue. This burden is indeed very heavy. On average, it accounts for more than 19 percent of farmers' total agricultural income, while in the old liberated areas, it accounts for 21 percent of their total agricultural income. "In order to achieve victory and restore the economy, the burden on farmers cannot be reduced for the time being." However, this burden has reached its limit and cannot be increased any further. Similarly, in order to achieve victory and restore the economy, the burden borne by urban industrialists and businessmen, especially those with assets, is much lighter than that of farmers. How to appropriately balance the burden between urban and rural areas is also a topic for 1950.
    II
    Summarizing what has been said above, we have come to the following understanding: There will be no more war on the mainland in 1950, and we should immediately seize this environment and this opportunity to start the work of restoring the economy; for the sake of long-term interests, for the sake of shortening the process of healing the wounds of war, and for the sake of enabling the broad masses of people to obtain a proper life as soon as possible, this work cannot be delayed for a moment. The Northeast's heavy industry must be laid as a foundation, water conservancy projects must be undertaken, grain and cotton production must be increased, transportation must be restored, the compatriots in the disaster areas must be relieved, and the 9 million military, government, and civil service personnel must be maintained; moreover, in order to carry the revolution through to the end, for the sake of a comprehensive and thorough victory, Taiwan, Hainan Island, and other places must be liberated quickly. Today, everyone admits that we cannot start everything from scratch, because we do not have such strength. However, these few things cannot be reduced or stopped under any difficult conditions. If we do not go through the "severe frost and scorching sun" of 1950, how can we have the "gradual spring breeze to the thatched cottage" of 1951!
    In order to do so much essential work, the government on the one hand asks the People's Liberation Army and all public servants to continue to endure hardship and squeeze out funds from them as much as possible, and on the other hand keeps the construction investment at about a quarter of the estimated expenditure (including a part of the administrative expenses). However, it is still not enough. Vice Director Bo pointed out in his report that the deficit will still account for 18.7 percent. If this national revenue and expenditure budget was not a budget for striving for victory and restoring the economy, then putting on 5.7 percent of construction investment would balance the revenue and expenditure, and everything would be fine. However, today's People's Government works for the people, has foresight, and plans for long-term interests. "Rather have a deficit, strive for construction," this is truly a manifestation of responsible spirit. However, can the burden on farmers be increased any further? Can currency be issued recklessly? These are not allowed. As Director Chen said, "The people's purchase of bonds is also a burden in the case of national economic difficulties. But this burden is better than the loss caused by the increased issuance of banknotes and the decline in currency prices. The result of the decline in currency prices is that the value of the declining part is completely lost. Buying bonds is a burden at the moment, but after all, the principal can be repaid and interest can be obtained, which is not a loss. If the result of issuing bonds to reduce the deficit is that the currency value and price situation next year will be better than this year, then it will not only benefit the working people who live on wages and the military, government, and civil service personnel; but also be beneficial to the legitimate operation of industry and commerce. Therefore, from the perspective of the interests of all the people, issuing bonds is better than issuing more banknotes." In this way, the plan to issue bonds and hope that urban industrialists and businessmen will share a little burden has been brought to the forefront of the people across the country.
    III
    In addition to considering the People's Victory Indexed Bonds from the perspective of the interests of all the people and long-term plans, we would now like to say a few more words from the bonds themselves:
    First, the purpose of adopting the indexed standard for this People's Victory Indexed Bonds is entirely to protect the interests of bondholders, so that the bonds are truly bonds in name and in fact, rather than donations. The result of handling indexed savings in major cities over the past year has won the confidence of the broad masses of people; for example, in Shanghai, anyone can calculate the indexed price for tomorrow based on the market prices of the four materials today. Therefore, the implementation of wages based on indexed units is very appropriate, and has never been like the cost of living index published during the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, which made people feel completely deceived. On this basis, the adoption of the indexed standard for bonds is in line with the demands of the masses. Moreover, these materials are daily necessities for the people, and every household has more or less storage of them, while the government also has a considerable amount in its grasp, which can be said to be a win-win situation. As for the weighted statistics of various cities, it fully takes into account the size of the population, the degree of industrial and commercial development, and the order of liberation, so that this bond fully demonstrates its fairness and rationality.
    Second, as mentioned above, this bond is a bond, not a donation. From this point, it can be explained that the issuance of this bond is nothing more than freezing a part of the purchasing power, so that it is used and paid later. After buying the bond, this purchasing power still exists, but it is only temporarily lent to the government for use. This purchasing power may unconsciously damage the value of the currency because it wants to maintain the value of the currency. Now that it is in the hands of the government, because the deficit is reduced, the currency is reduced, and the production industry is supported, this force just plays the role of stabilizing prices and maintaining the value of the currency.
    Third, in the old days, the issuance of bonds required pointing to a certain income as a guarantee for the repayment of principal and interest. This bond did not do so. Why? Because this bond is all used for construction, in other words, it is guaranteed by all the assets of the country. In the national budget for next year, the revenue and expenditure compared have 18.7 percent as a deficit. The method of making up for the deficit relies on the issuance of bonds to account for 38.4 percent, that is, 7.2 percent of the total national expenditure, while the total construction investment accounts for 23.9 percent, greatly exceeding the number of bonds issued. It can be seen that this bond is all used for construction, used to heal the wounds of war, which has never happened in the history of Chinese bonds.
    Fourth, from the point that all of it is used for construction, we can draw an interesting conclusion, that is, the issuance of this bond is nothing more than gathering a part of the strength scattered in various cities and various industrialists and businessmen by the government, organizing it, on the one hand replacing the issuance of currency, and on the other hand using it more effectively for economic construction. In this sense, the government is equivalent to performing the task of a bank, and the person who buys the bond is equivalent to an account with a long-term deposit of more than one year. This nature can reduce the seriousness of many people's views on bonds, and this nature can only exist in today's People's Government, because only the People's Government will use every bit of strength to restore the economy, will take care of the rights of bondholders, and will ensure creditworthiness.
    Fifth, the number of this People's Victory Indexed Bonds is not very large. According to estimates by industrialists and businessmen and economists, the total of 200 million units is equivalent to about 200 million silver dollars; this number is very small compared with the amount of bonds issued during the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. The Kuomintang issued a total of 1.106 billion silver dollars in bonds from 1928 to 1932. In 1930 alone, it issued 416 million silver dollars. Now the country has been unified (which has never happened in the Kuomintang era) and the number is so limited, not because after 22 years of Jiang Fei's exploitation and extortion, the industrialists and businessmen will not even have what Director Chen called a sense of burden for this little bond.
    Sixth, because after Jiang Fei's unscrupulous exploitation, today's industrialists and businessmen have a bit of a sense of burden for this People's Victory Indexed Bonds. Then, the issuance of this bond, which mainly relies on urban industrialists and businessmen and wealthy households to subscribe, will it affect the existence and development of industrial and commercial enterprises? On this point, the author wants to make a very objective analysis based on the experience of engaging in industrial and commercial undertakings in the past: Any industrialist or businessman feels inconvenient about a part of the funds being frozen in any way. But if you want to choose between freezing funds and price fluctuations, then you will undoubtedly prefer to freeze a part of the funds, because price fluctuations are most unfavorable to legitimate industry and commerce. If the issuance of bonds reduces the issuance of banknotes and stabilizes prices, then it is enough to reserve raw materials for one month, which originally required more than three months of reserves. It is now possible to put the proceeds from the sale of goods in the bank for a period of time, and then replenish them at leisure. This is what legitimate industrialists and businessmen dream of. At this time, the funds that were frozen due to the purchase of bonds have been recovered several times the price. Moreover, when prices are stable, the supply of funds is normal, the source is smooth, borrowing is easy, and the interest rate is low. At this time, industrialists and businessmen can move from coping with current business to deploying the development of undertakings. Therefore, all legitimate industrialists and businessmen will enthusiastically support and actively subscribe to the issuance of this People's Victory Indexed Bonds.
    On May 4, 1947, the Soviet Union issued the second post-war construction bond, with a total amount of 20 billion rubles (equivalent to 4 billion US dollars at that time). However, in less than 24 hours, the amount subscribed by the Soviet Union exceeded this number. In the past few days, the movement to subscribe to bonds has been in full swing across the country. The national industrial and commercial circles and patriotic people should all give play to the spirit of new patriotism and learn from the Soviet Union to complete this glorious task with enthusiasm.

　　为什么要发行人民胜利折实公债
    孙晓村
  　一
    一九五○年人民胜利折实公债就要发行了。这几天来，各大城市的工商业联合会及其他人民团体纷纷来电表示拥护，这事实说明了两点：首先是全国工商业者对政府这次发行公债的意义及其措施，表示满意；其次，我们不难预计公债发行后，一定可在很短的时期内认购足额的。这次人民胜利折实公债的发行，直接是为了弥补明年度的财政赤字，间接是为了平稳物价，而且发行的时间是在中国大际全部解放之时，国家的经济正在由战时转入平时的时候，对于这一切，任何一个稍有远见的工商业者，都会从长远利益的打算上予以最高的认识和估价的。
    这二万万分的公债已列为一九五○年度财政的收入，这一九五○年也将和一九四九年是人民解放战争赢得全面的决定性的胜利的一年一样，必须在克服经济困难，医治战争创伤，恢复和发展工农业的生产上也赢得基本的胜利。因此，人民胜利折实公债的被踊跃认购，不仅在数字上，特别在意义上，将对一九五○年的经济作战起着很大的作用。
    放在眼前的一九五○年的情况，有下列几点应当指出的：
    首先是一九五○年中国大陆上已无战事。这是天大的好事，它保证着一切建设工作可以有计划有步骤地做去。中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党领导下，对于经济建设的努力，以及在这上面所表现出来的才能与创造性，是值得称道的，东北就是一个例子。从一九四九年起，东北境内已无战争，使东北能以全力从事生产，工商业正逐渐恢复，物价仅上涨了百分之八十，而且对于支援关内，尽了很大的力量。从东北的例子，可以看出一九五○年关内整个地区的前途。但是，没有战事并不就等于建设，长期战争所遗留下来的创伤和破坏，需要一个相当时期的治疗和休养。因此，明年环境是好转了，但工作是重的，负担也是重的。
    第二，一九五○年经济建设的工作，基本上还是恢复性的，例如概算中工业部分的投资将有百分之七十用于东北，使它能迅速地走完恢复的路程。在水利方面，保证明年如再遇到今年这样大水可以不再造成今年这样大的灾害；农业方面，提出粮食增产一百亿斤，棉花增产四百七十万担的要求，也是以过去的水平为标准的。可是，有一点值得指出的，就是这基本上虽然还是恢复性的经济建设工作，事实上已被提高到这样的一个阶段：就是全部投资在总支出中占百分之二三．九，而且几乎每一件事都通过专业会议，都被规定了具体的进程和内容，并且开始作长期的打算。
    第三，一九五○年政府财政上的最大负荷，就是要负担九百万军政公务人员的生活费用；此外，为了解放台湾海南岛西藏等地，也需要一笔不小的支出。这些负担是胜利途中不可避免的。薄副主任说得好：“把所有旧军队旧公教人员一齐包下来，给以生活的出路，逐渐加以改造，并准备在一二年内转入经济建设，慢慢地再减少下来，是人民政府的责任。”尤其从整个社会经济打算时，消费是同样的，而当政府包下来之后，虽在财政上显着负担很重，便对社会经济是有好处的，因为那是一种有组织有秩序有限度的消费，而且经过改造可以转化为生产的力量。在这儿，有一件事实必须指出的，就是一九五○年中国人民解放军以及全体公教人员仍过着极刻苦的生活，全国概算中，建设投资所以能占到百分之二十三点九，都是革命的军队，领导革命的党以及全国公教人员节衣缩食省吃俭用的结果。
    第四，今年大水所造成的灾害，十分严重，单就受灾田亩一项而言，据各方估计，达一万万亩之多。今年黄河在秋汛中的流量超过一九三三年的纪录，长江的洪水位是一九三一年以后最大的一次，再加上国民党反动统治期间，对防洪工作的忽视、贻误、长期的失修和恶意的破坏，遂造成这样空前严重的灾情。这场大水，如果发生在国民党反动统治时期，人民生命财产的损失，必十百倍于今年，因为今年水灾虽如此严重，但由于各解放区的领导者和广大群众的英勇搏斗，不只一次，也不只一地，战胜了洪水，克服了困难。可是灾荒给予社会经济的影响还是相当严重，尤其是从现在到明年麦收以前，灾区的粮食如何接济，农作如何恢复，各大城市的日用必需品的供应如何保证，各地区之间如何调剂？这一切，无论就运输而言，就物资本身而言，都需要各级政府与广大人民结合起来，大力处理。
    第五，目前财政上存在着一个现象，就是农村和都市的负担显着不平衡，八年对日抗战，四年解放战争中，农民出力出钱，确已贡献了他们最大的力量，一九五○年政府要求农民继续负担，在收入概算中，农民所缴纳的公粮，仍占第一位，即全部收入中百分之四十一点四。这个负担确已很重，就全国平均言，占到农民的农业总收入百分之十九强，而老解放区则占其农业总收入百分之二十一。“为了胜利与恢复经济，农民的负担一时是无法减轻的。”但是，这样的负担已到了限度，不能再增加了，同样为了胜利与恢复经济，城市工商业者，尤其一般拥有资产的人所负担的，比到农民，实在轻得多。如何适当地使城市与农村的负担得到平衡，这也是一九五○年的一个课题。
    二
    总结上面所说的，我们得到了这样的认识：一九五○年大陆已无战事，我们应当立刻把握这个环境与这个时机，展开恢复经济的工作；为了长远的利益，为了缩短医治战争创伤的过程，为了早日使人民大众得到适当的生活，这工作是一刻也不容许耽误的。东北重工业不能不打基础，水利工程不能不举办，粮食棉花不能不增产，交通运输不能不恢复，灾区的同胞不能不救济，九百万军政公教人员不能不维持；还有，为了把革命进行到底，为了全面的彻底的胜利，台湾海南岛等更不能不迅速地予以解放。今天，谁都承认我们不能百废俱举，因为我们没有这样的力量，然而这几件事，在任何困难的条件下，不能减少或停止的，不是一九五○年的“严霜烈日都经过”，那会有一九五一年的“次第春风到草庐”呢！
    为了要做这许多必不可少的工作，政府一方面要求人民解放军和所有的公教人员继续吃苦，从他们的身上尽量挤出经费来，另一方面把建设投资保持在支出概算四分之一的左右（连行政费一部分在内），然而还是不够，薄副主任在报告中曾指出，赤字还要占到百分之十八点七。假若这个全国收支概算不是一个争取胜利和恢复经济的概算，那么，放上百分之五点七的建设投资，就收支平衡，万事大吉了。然而今天的人民政府是为人民做事的，是有远见的，是为长期利益打算的。“宁愿赤字，力争建设”，这实在是负责精神的表现。然而，农民的负担能再增加吗？通货可以不顾一切地增发吗？这都是不容许的。陈主任说得好：“人民购买了公债，在全国经济困难情况下，也是一种负担。但是这种负担，比起因增发钞票，币价下跌所受的损失说来，是比较好的。固为币价下跌的结果，其下跌部分的币值是全部损失了的，购买了公债，在一时算来是负担，但是究竟可还本得息，不是一种损失。如果发行公债缩小赤字的结果，使明年的币值与物价情况比今年改善，则非但对全国工资生活的劳动人民，和军政公教人员有好处；而且，对于工商业的正当经营，也是有益的。所以从全体人民的利益说来，发行公债比之多发钞票要好些”。这样，发行公债，并且希望由城市工商业者来分一点负担的方案，便被提到全国人民的前面来了。
    三
    对于人民胜利折实公债，我们除了从全体人民的利益以及长远计划考虑外，现在还想从公债本身再说几句话：
    第一，这次人民胜利折实公债，采用折实标准，目的完全是保护公债持有人的利益，使公债是名符其实的债，而不是捐。折实储蓄，一年来在各大城市办理的结果，已博得广大人民的信心；例如在上海，任何一个人都可以根据今天四种物资的市价，算出明天的折实牌价，所以工资以折实单位为标准，施行得十分妥贴，从未如国民党反动统治时代所发表的生活指数一样，叫人感觉到完全是欺骗的。在这样的基础上，公债采用了折实标准，是合乎群众的要求的。还有，这几种物资，是人民日用必需品，家家户户都有或多或少的存储的，而在政府方面也掌握着相当数量，可谓两不吃亏。至于各城市的加权统计，又充分的顾到人口多寡，工商业的发达程度，以及解放先后等情形，使这次公债充分表现它的公平性与合理性。
    第二，上面说过，这次公债是债，不是捐。由这一点，可以说明这次公债的发行无非是冻结了一部分购买力，使它延期使用，延期支付。买了公债之后，这份购买力还是存在的，不过暂时借给政府使用而已。这份购买力放在私人手里，可能因为想保持币值之故，恰恰无意识地作了损害币值的行为。现在掌握在政府手中，由于赤字减少，通货减发，生产事业得到扶植，这份力量恰恰发挥了稳定物价保持币值的作用。
    第三，旧时代发行公债，要指着一定的收入作还本付息的担保。这次公债没有这样做。为什么呢？因为这次公债全部用于建设，换言之，是以国家的全部资产来担保的。明年全国概算中，收支相比，有百分之十八点七是赤字，弥补赤字的办法，依靠发行公债的占百分之三十八点四，即占全国总支出的百分之七点二，而全部建设投资则占百分之二十三点九，大大地超过了公债的发行数。可见这次公债全部用于建设，用于医治战争的创伤，这在中国公债史上从来不曾有过的。
    第四，从全部用于建设这一点上，我们可以引申到一个有趣的结论，就是这次发行公债，无非把分散在各城市各工商业者的一部分力量，由政府集中起来，组织起来，一方面代替通货的发行，一方面更有效地用诸经济建设。在这个意义上，政府等于执行了银行的任务，而买公债的人等于一年以上的长期存款的户头。这种性质可以减少许多人对公债看法的严重性，而这种性质只能存在于今天的人民政府，因为只有人民政府才会把一点一滴的力量全部用于恢复经济，才会顾到公债的持有人的权利，才会确保债信。
    第五，这次人民胜利折实公债，数目并不大，据工商业家与经济学者估计，全部两万万分，约合银元两亿元；这个数字与国民党反动统治时代所发公债数额相比时，真是很小。国民党从一九二八年到一九三二年这期间，共发行公债十一亿零六百万银元，单以其中一九三○这年而言，就发了四亿一千六百万银元。现在全国已经统一，（这是国民党时代所不曾有过的）数目又这样有限，不是因为经过了二十二年的蒋匪的剥削榨取，巧取豪夺，对于这一点公债，工商业者连陈主任所谓负担之感都不会有的。
    第六，因为经过了蒋匪的无所不用其极的搜刮，今天工商业者对于这次人民胜利折实公债，多少有点负担之感的。那末，这次公债的发行，主要的要靠城市工商业者及殷实富户来承购，会不会因而影响工商企业的存在与发展呢？对于这一点，作者想以过去从事工商事业的经验来做一个非常客观的分析：任何一个工商业者对于一部分资金的在任何一种方式下被冻结，是感觉到不方便的。但如果要在冻结资金与物价波动两者之间，选择一个，则无疑是宁愿资金被冻结一部分的，因为物价波动对于正当工商业最为不利。假使因发了公债而少发钞票，使物价得了稳定，那么原来要储备三个月以上的原料，现在储备一个月就够了，原来卖出物资以后必须立即补进，稍迟便无法补回原来的数量，现在可以把售货所得价款在银行里放一个时期，然后从容补进。这才是正当工商业者梦寐以求的事。这时，因买了公债而呆搁了的那笔资金，已取回来了数倍的代价。还有，物价平稳时，资金供应正常，来源畅顺，借款容易，利息也低，这时，工商业者才能从目前业务的应付，进入到发展事业的部署。所以，对于这一次人民胜利折实公债的发行，所有正当工商业者一定会热烈拥护，踊跃承购的。
    一九四七年五月四日，苏联发行战后第二次建设公债，它的总额高达二百亿卢布，（当时相当于四十亿美元），可是，不到二十四小时，苏联全国的承购额，就已超过这个数目了。这几天来，国内各地承购公债的运动已在如火如荼地展开，全国工商界和爱国人民，都应当发挥新爱国主义的精神，学习苏联，以热烈的心情来完成这光荣的任务。（完）
