Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 23rd: To support rural sideline production and solve the livelihood difficulties of disaster victims, the Shandong Provincial People's Government recently convened responsible personnel from relevant departments to discuss the issue of promoting local products. The meeting decided that in addition to large-scale sales to the outside through state-owned trading companies and cooperatives, private merchants should also be encouraged and organized to go to the countryside to collect local products to seek widespread sales. Shandong Province has approximately one hundred types of local products and rural by-products (including marine products). The province's specialty products such as hawthorns, chestnuts, walnuts, dates, persimmon cakes, almonds, pears, and apples have an annual output of 200 million jin. The production of mats is about 10 million, plus the Glauber's salt, hairnets, soybean oil, and homespun cloth produced in the Bohai region, and the tussah silk, eri silk, and straw braid produced in the Jiaodong region. If all of these can be sold, the livelihood problems of 3 to 4 million people can be solved by next spring. Currently, the Provincial Cooperative Marketing Department has allocated 200,000 jin of grain as the first batch to purchase yellow pears in the Pingyi area. The Bohai Cooperative Headquarters is purchasing the famous specialty product, small dates, in Leling and other counties. The local products purchased by various departments have now begun to be sold to Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Northeast China.

　　扶持农村副业
    山东推销土产
    【新华社济南二十三日电】为扶持农村副业生产，解决灾民生活困难，山东省人民政府特于日前召集有关部门负责人员，讨论土产推销问题。会上决定除通过国营贸易公司及合作社大量向外推销外；并鼓励和组织私商下乡收集土产，以求广泛推销。按山东全省土产和农村副产品约一百余种（包括海产）。该省特产之山楂、栗子、胡桃、枣、柿饼、杏仁、梨、苹果等年产达二万万斤，产席约一千万领，加之渤海地区所产之皮硝、发网、豆油、土布及胶东区所产之柞蚕丝、桐蚕丝、草帽辫等，如能全部推销出去，明春即可解决三百至四百万人的生活问题。现该省合作供销处已首批拨粮二十万斤，在平邑一带收购黄梨；渤海合作总社在乐陵等县收购驰名特产小枣。各部门所购的土产现已开始向上海、广州以及东北各地推销。
