Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 29th: The first National Grain Conference convened by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, lasting six days, successfully concluded on the 27th. Twenty-four people attended the meeting, including the directors, deputy directors, and section chiefs of the grain bureaus of major administrative regions such as the Northeast, Northwest, East China, Central South China, and Inner Mongolia. The conference discussed future grain collection and management issues and formulated a high-level grain plan for 1950. When Vice Minister of Finance Rong Zihe summarized the achievements of the conference at its closing, he said: The important gain of this conference is that we have a preliminary understanding of the situation in various regions and, after repeated verification, we have confidence and assurance in completing the agricultural tax, which accounts for 41 percent of the state revenue estimate. Secondly, the conference set a high-level grain plan for the coming year. In addition to guaranteeing the military and government's food needs, a considerable portion can be allocated to the Ministry of Trade for regulating people's food supply and supplying cities. This is the first time in decades that China has solved the problem of feeding its population without relying on foreign grain. Thirdly, the conference formulated concrete steps on how to unify agricultural tax rates and tax laws. The conference initially summarized the experiences of various regions, believing that the proportional tax implemented in the old liberated areas this year is suitable for the rural situation after land reform, encourages production, and is simple and easy to implement. In some areas of the newly liberated areas, the method of "utilizing the old foundation, keeping the middle unchanged, and adding to the top and subtracting from the bottom" can not only ensure completion but also initially implement policies, which can continue to be promoted in the newly liberated areas in the future. Fourthly, in terms of management, grain should be stored as centrally as possible, scientific methods should be used to train professionals, and a budget system, a grading and classification acceptance and storage system, an inspection and testing system, a grain protection system, a reward and punishment system, and a trial economic accounting system should be established. Fifthly, the conference discussed the guidelines, organizations, and relationships with other relevant departments for grain collection and management, and suggested strengthening the grain department organizations and establishing unified, vertically managed national grain depots to uniformly manage high-level grain. In addition, the conference also suggested that in the newly liberated areas, the movement to reduce rent should be combined with a thorough investigation of black land evading taxes in this winter and next spring, and a preliminary assessment of land yields should be carried out. In the old liberated areas, adjustments should be made to the unbalanced estimates of yields as much as possible, in order to gradually achieve reasonable burdens and increase state revenue. Finally, Vice Minister Rong asked the representatives to vigorously supervise the autumn harvest after returning, ensure the completion of the budgeted figures, and effectively grasp the existing grain; and to strengthen rural surveys this winter and next spring, with each province surveying at least two or three typical villages for reference at the agricultural tax research conference in March next year.

　　Bo Yibo's Invited Speech:
    Thoroughly eliminating the feudal system is for the purpose of developing production, and the policy towards landlords is to transform them through production. The most important thing for governments at all levels is to develop production.
    On the morning of the fourth day of the conference, Bo Yibo, Secretary of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, accepted the invitation of the presidium and rushed from Beijing to give a speech. He first elaborated on the significance of convening people's representative conferences at all levels. Then he put forward a few opinions on the land reform issue that was being heatedly discussed at the conference, asking everyone to discuss them. He said: Thoroughly eliminating the feudal and semi-feudal exploitation system is a set policy, because the feudal exploitation system hinders the development of China's production. However, landlords are not to be eliminated physically, but transformed through production. Therefore, peasants should: 1. Not sweep landlords out of their homes, 2. Not beat, deduct, or kill them indiscriminately, 3. Not dig up hidden wealth or divide floating wealth, 4. Not touch the landlords' oil mills, flour mills, and other industries and businesses. Finally, landlords should be left with the same amount of land and property as the peasants. Landlords should: 1. Not conceal livestock, farm implements, and everything related to agricultural production, 2. Not slaughter pigs and sheep, cut down trees, or waste and destroy things, 3. Produce well and seek transformation through labor. He further emphasized not touching the middle peasants, and especially paying attention not to infringe upon the interests of the wealthy middle peasants, and resolutely implementing the policy of keeping the middle untouched and leveling the two ends. Finally, he asked the conference to focus on production. He said: The main responsibility of the Tongxian People's Government and the county magistrate, district chiefs, and village chiefs is to develop production. There is nothing more important than this. We hold people's representative conferences at all levels and run schools, etc., all for the purpose of developing production. He said: Everyone advocates running cooperatives, which is a very good thing. Please discuss it carefully. I think the county government should do this, and strive to set up one in each village, to buy back the things the people need: cloth, kerosene, needles, thread, etc., and to sell the eggs, bristles, furs, etc. that the people need to export. Trading companies should also help the cooperatives. If there is not enough funds, the government should provide loans. He hopes that everyone will concentrate their efforts on discussing a few production matters, stipulate them specifically, and entrust them to the county government to handle. At the next meeting, carefully check the implementation of the resolutions.

    Set Next Year's Grain Allocation Plan
    In addition to guaranteeing military and government needs, a considerable part can be allocated to regulate the people's food. This is the first time in decades that China has solved the problem of feeding its population without relying on foreign grain.

　　Discussion Center Shifts to Production
　  Unanimous demand for the establishment of cooperatives, the development of sideline businesses, the accumulation of large amounts of fertilizer, frugality in times of famine, the repair of the Jian'gan River, and the development of water conservancy.
    Representatives from all walks of life greatly supported Comrade Bo Yibo's suggestion to make production the center of the conference's discussion, and launched a heated discussion. Summarizing the opinions of various groups, there are the following issues: (1) Establish cooperatives and develop winter sideline production, such as opening tofu shops, oil mills, flour mills, weaving mats, boiling saltpeter, buying eggs, bristles, pig hair, raising pigs, raising chickens, engaging in transportation, and fishing. (2) Accumulate large amounts of fertilizer to prepare for next year's fertilizer. (3) Advocate frugality to tide over the famine this winter and next spring. (4) The Jian'gan River has been in disrepair for many years, and the river floods during the rainy season, with the first and second districts suffering the most damage. It is requested that the government adopt the method of providing work as a form of relief and start work next spring. (5) Develop water conservancy and increase the area of paddy fields.
    During the breaks in the group discussions, forums were held separately for industry and commerce, education, women, and health, and specialized discussions were held on how urban and rural people can establish close ties, how to carry out winter studies, and how to carry out rural epidemic prevention and health work.

　　The Conference Passes Six Resolutions
　  The county magistrate said that the government is willing to implement them under the supervision of the people, and the secretary of the county party committee called on party members to be models in implementing the resolutions.
    On the last day of the conference, County Magistrate Li Zifan made a reply speech on the various proposals, and earnestly explained the various issues. The conference unanimously approved County Magistrate Li Zifan's report on the government's work in the past year and its future work guidelines, and made six resolutions on production, land reform, agricultural tax collection, culture and education, industrial and commercial management, and health. At this point, the representatives spoke one after another, warmly celebrating the success of the conference. Li Yingming, secretary of the Tongxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on all Communist Party members in the county to become models in implementing the resolutions of the people's representative conference, and to strengthen cooperation with non-party members. In his closing remarks, Li Zifan hoped that the representatives would often reflect the people's opinions to the government to close the relationship between the government and the people, and on behalf of all the cadres, he expressed his willingness to implement the resolutions under the supervision of the people and serve the people wholeheartedly. Finally, the conference successfully closed after electing the standing committee.

　　讨论全国粮食征收与管理问题
　  财政部召开粮食会议
    戎副部长号召保证完成概算数字
    【新华社北京二十九日电】中央人民政府财政部召开的第一届全国粮食会议历时六天，已于二十七日圆满闭幕。出席这次会议的有东北、西北、华东、华中南、内蒙等各大行政区粮食局局长、副局长及科长以上干部二十四人。会议讨论了今后粮食征收与管理问题，拟定了一九五○年粮食高度的计划。财政部副部长戎子和在会议闭幕时总结这次会议的成就时说：此次会议的重要收获是初步了解各地的情况并经过反复核算，对完成占国家收入概算百分之四十一的农业税，有了信心和保证。其次是会议定出了明年度粮食高度的计划，除了保证军政需用的食粮外，尚可拨出相当大的一部分给贸易部作调剂民食、供应城市之用。这是几十年中国不靠外国粮食人口而由自己解决问题的第一次。第三、会议对农业税率、税法如何走向统一拟定了具体的步骤。会议初步总结了各地的经验，认为今年老区实行的比例税适合土地改革后的农村情况，鼓励生产，简便易行；新区某些地方采用“利用旧基础，中间不动，上加下减”的办法，既能保证完成，又可初步贯彻政策，在以后新解放地区可以继续推行。第四、在管理方面，对粮食要尽可能集中保存，采用科学方法培养专业人员，并建立预决算制度、分等分类接收保管制度、检查检验制度、护粮制度、奖惩制度，和试行经济核算制度。第五、会议讨论了征收与管理粮食方面的方针、机构与其他有关部门的关系，建议加强粮食部门机构，并建立统一垂直的国家粮库，统一管理高度。此外，会议又建议：新区要在今冬明春要结合减租运动，清查逃税的黑地，并初步评议土地产量，老区亦尽可能作到对产量估计不平衡加以调整，以逐步达到合理负担、增加国家收入的目的。最后，戎副部长要求与会代表回去之后，要大力督促秋征，保证完成概算数字，切实掌握现存粮食；并在今冬明春加强农村调查，每省至少要调查两三个典型村，以供明年三月农业税研究会议参考。
　　薄一波应邀讲话：
    彻底消灭封建制度，是为了发展生产，对地主的政策是从生产中改造他们。  各级政府最重要的事情就是发展生产。
    会议第四日上午，中共中央华北局书记薄一波应主席团的邀请从北京赶来讲话，他首先就召开各界人民代表会议的意义，详加阐述。接着他对大会热烈讨论的土地改革问题提出几点意见，请大家讨论。他说：彻底消灭封建、半封建剥削制度，这是已定政策，因为封建剥削制度阻碍了中国生产的发展。但对地主个人，不是肉体消灭，而是生产改造。因之，农民对地主：一、不要扫地出门，二、不要乱打、乱扣、乱杀，三、不要挖底财和分浮财，四、不要动地主的油房、粉房等工商业，最后还要给地主留下与农民同样一份土地和财产。地主对农民：一、不隐瞒耕畜、农具和有关农业生产的一切东西，二、不要杀猪羊、砍树木、浪费破坏，三、要好好生产，从劳动中求得改造。他更强调不动中农，特别要注意不侵犯富裕中农的利益，坚决执行中间不动两头平的政策。最后，他要求大会，把中心放到生产上去。他说：通县人民政府和县长、区长、村长的主要责任就是发展生产，除此以外，再没有其他比这更重要的事情。我们开各界人民代表会议以及办学校等，也都是为了发展生产。他说：大家主张办合作社，这是很好的事，请大家好好讨论，我想县政府应该做这件事，争取每个村里办一个，替老百姓买回需要的东西：布、煤油、针、线等，替老百姓推销需要出境的鸡蛋、猪鬃、皮毛等。贸易公司也要帮助合作社，资金不足时政府应贷款。他希望大家集中力量，讨论几件生产事情，具体规定出来，交托县政府去办。下次再开这个会，认真检查决议执行的情形。
    定出明年粮食调度计划
    除保证军政需用外，尚可拨出相当大一部分作调剂民食之用。这是几十年来中国不靠外国粮食人口而由自己解决问题的第一次。
　　讨论中心转向生产
　  一致要求建立合作社、开展副业、大量积肥、节约渡荒、修箭杆河、开展水利。
    各界代表对薄一波同志以生产问题作为大会讨论中心的建议，非常拥护，遂展开了热烈讨论。综合各组意见，有以下几个问题：（一）建立合作社，开展冬季副业生产，如开办豆腐房、油房、粉房，编席、熬硝，收买鸡蛋、猪鬃、猪毛，养猪，养鸡，搞运输，捕鱼。（二）大量积肥，准备明年肥料。（三）提倡节约，渡过今冬明春的灾荒。（四）箭杆河年久失修，雨季河水泛滥，一、二区受灾最大，要求政府采取以工代赈的方法于明年春动工。（五）开展水利，增加水田面积。
    在小组讨论空隙，分别举行了工商、教育、妇女、卫生等座谈会，对城乡人民如何取得密切联系，如何开展冬学，开展农村防疫卫生工作等问题，均作了专门讨论。
　　大会通过六项决议
　  县长表示政府愿在人民监督下贯彻执行，中共县委书记号召党员要做执行决议的模范。
    大会最后一天，由县长李子凡对各项提案作解答发言，对各项问题均分别加以恳切说明。大会遂一致通过李子凡县长一年来政府工作及今后工作方针的报告，并作了关于生产、土地改革、征收农业税、文化教育、工商管理、卫生等六项决议。至此，各代表均相继发言，热烈庆祝大会的成功。中共通县县委书记李英明号召全县的共产党员要成为执行各界代表会议决议的模范，要加强与党外人士的合作。李子凡于闭幕词中，希望代表经常将人民的意见，反映给政府，以密切政府与人民的联系，并代表全体干部，愿在各界人民的监督下贯彻执行决议，全心全意为人民服务。最后，大会在选出常务委员会后即胜利闭幕。
