Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 29th: The People's Liberation Army, entering Guangxi from the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou border, received a warm welcome from the Miao and Zhuang people along the way. As early as 1930, the Seventh Army of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army passed through these areas to join forces with the main force of the Red Army. At that time, the Red Army had strict discipline and strictly observed the customs of the Miao and Zhuang people, leaving a deep impression on them. In the nearly 20 years under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, the Miao and Zhuang people were referred to as "uncivilized people" and suffered greatly from the bandit gang's grain robbery and conscription. In order to suppress their resistance, the Li and Bai bandit gangs not only dispatched a large number of bandit troops to carry out bloody massacres, but also used airplanes to drop incendiary bombs to burn their villages to the ground. Therefore, the Miao and Zhuang people were always thinking about and eager for the Red Army to return and avenge them. This time, when they learned that the PLA was coming, that the PLA was the Red Army that had passed by 19 years ago, they made early preparations to welcome them. Some, in order to see the Red Army they had been separated from for nearly 20 years, took a boat from afar to the route of the PLA's advance. When the PLA entered Guizhou from southwestern Hunan and arrived at Rongjiang County, the Miao people there greeted them warmly with torches along the road. After the PLA set up camp, many Miao and Zhuang people voluntarily sent food and bought pork to慰劳(weilao, to express appreciation to) them, but the PLA politely declined them all. The Miao and Zhuang people in Dongzeng and Gaozeng areas on the border of Guizhou and Guangxi deliberately lowered prices when the PLA purchased goods. For example, originally one silver yuan could buy sixty catties of grain, but when they sold it to the PLA, they had to give ten or twenty more catties. Before entering Guangxi this time, the commanders and fighters of the PLA launched a study of respecting and uniting ethnic minorities. In addition to being familiar with some of the customs of the ethnic minorities, they also learned some simple Miao languages, such as "咙lì＠①" (eat), "呼烟" (smoke), "几非" (thank you), etc. Therefore, wherever the PLA went, the commanders and fighters were able to get along with the Miao and Zhuang compatriots without any barriers. When the PLA entered northern Guangxi, the Miao and Zhuang people, men, women, and children, welcomed them along the way, rejoicing wildly. Many Miao and Zhuang compatriots offered water and tea by the roadside to comfort the passing troops. The soldiers then invited them to "呼烟", and before leaving, they said "几非，几非" to each other, fully demonstrating the spirit of unity and friendship between fraternal ethnic groups, and the love of the people of the whole country for the People's Liberation Army.

　　解放军经过湘桂黔边境
  　苗僮族人民热烈欢迎
    【新华社华南前线二十九日电】自湘桂黔边境进入广西的人民解放军，沿途受到苗、僮族人民的热烈欢迎。远在一九三○年时，工农红军第七军就曾经过这些地区与红军主力会师。当时红军纪律严明，严格遵守苗、僮人民的风俗习惯，在苗、僮人民中留下了深刻的印象。近二十年来在国民党匪帮的统治下，苗、僮人民被斥为“化外之民”，饱受匪帮抢粮抓丁的蹂躏。李、白匪帮为镇压他们的反抗，除派遣大量匪军进行血腥的屠杀外，并用飞机投掷烧夷弹将他们居住的村庄焚为平地。因此苗、僮人民无时不惦记和渴望红军回来替他们报仇。这次当他们知道解放军来了，解放军就是十九年前路过的红军，他们都老早做好了欢迎准备工作。有的为了看一看阔别近二十年的红军，特从远道坐船赶到解放军进军的路线上。当解放军由湘西南入黔到达榕江县时，该地苗民打着火把在路旁热烈欢迎。解放军宿营后，许多苗、僮族人民都自动送粮食，买猪肉来慰劳，但解放军都一一婉言辞谢。黔桂边境洞增、高增一带苗、僮人民并在解放军购物时有意把物价降低。如原来银洋一元买六十斤粮食，他们卖给解放军时一定要多给十斤或二十斤。在此次进军广西前，解放军指战员们曾展开了尊重和团结少数民族学习，除了熟习一些少数民族的风俗习惯外，并且学会了一些简单的苗胞语言，如“咙ｌì＠①”（吃饭）、“呼烟”（抽烟）“几非”（多谢）等。因此，解放军每到一处，指战员们都能和苗、僮族同胞相处无间。解放军进入桂北时，沿途苗、僮族人民男女老幼夹道欢迎，欢欣若狂。许多苗、僮族同胞在路旁提水倒茶，慰问过路大军。战士们则请他们“呼烟”，临行时互道“几非，几非”充分表现了兄弟民族间团结友爱的精神，和全国人民对人民解放军的热爱。
