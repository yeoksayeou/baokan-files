　　To Protect Factories and Prevent Sabotage
　　Beijing 70th Arsenal Improves Safety Equipment

　　[Beijing News] According to the directive from the Ministry of Heavy Industry regarding the protection of factories, prevention of sabotage, and implementation of emergency inspections, the administrative side of the 70th Arsenal convened responsible comrades from the Party, labor union, and Youth League on November 18th. They held a meeting to discuss implementation methods and decided to establish an inspection committee to carry out publicity and mobilization work. Documents related to protecting property and reducing losses were printed and distributed to labor union member groups and study groups for discussion. On the 19th, a meeting of cadres from various departments was held to convey instructions from higher authorities. On the 22nd, the inspection committee held a meeting and decided to establish inspection teams in each unit. After preliminary inspections, various units proposed improvement suggestions one after another: some units suggested establishing a responsibility system for machine usage and tool storage; some units believed that inspection agencies should be established regularly, an inspection system should be established, factory-stored materials should be organized, material warehouses should be established for safekeeping, and responsibility systems should be issued. Specific improvements initially proposed included: in terms of water and electricity, transformers should be equipped with lightning arresters, "wind tigers" (blowers) should be added for ventilation motors, and electrical wires and motor frames should be installed with protective covers, etc. In terms of machinery and equipment, the large motors driving the line shafts and the line shaft suspensions should be the responsibility of dedicated personnel, and machine gears and the tools used for each machine should be cleaned regularly. In terms of fire prevention, fire engines must be started every day, and methods to prevent fire buckets from freezing should be found. Regarding factory building safety, smelting furnaces and copper furnaces must be extinguished to prevent disasters, and electrical grids must be inspected regularly. The presentation of the above improvement suggestions is a concrete manifestation of workers' love for the factory. In addition, shortcomings still existing in other areas will be overcome through continued inspections.

    【北京讯】七十兵工厂根据重工业部为保护工厂、防止破坏、实行紧急检查的指示，十一月十八日行政方面召集党、工、团的负责同志，开会商讨执行办法，并决议成立检查委员会，进行宣传动员工作，印制有关保护财产、减少损失等文件，发给工会会员小组、学习小组进行讨论。十九日又召开各部门干部会议，传达上级指示。二十二日检查委员会召开会议，决议在各单位成立检查小组。经过初步检查后各单位纷纷提出改进意见：有的单位建议建立机器使用及工具保管的责任制；有的单位认为应经常设立检查机构，建立检查制度，整理厂存器材，建立器材库房保管，颁发责任制等办法。初步提出的具体改进事项有：水电方面，变压器应按避电器，增添吹风马达用的风老虎，电线、马达架线应安装皮套等。机器设备方面，带动天轴的大马达及天轴吊挂等应由专人负责，并应经常清理机器牙轮及每部机器所用的工具等。消防方面，消防车要每天发动，消防水桶应设法防冻。厂房安全方面，化铁炉、铜炉要熄火防灾，电网要经常检查等。以上各种改进意见的提出，是工人爱护工厂的具体表现。此外，在其他地方仍存在着的缺点，都将在继续检查下得到克服。
