Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 6th: TASS Moscow reports: *Pravda* published an editorial on the 4th entitled "The Struggle for the Unity of the Working Class," commenting on the Cominform's resolution on the unity of the working class and the tasks of the Communist and Workers' Parties.

*Pravda* first quoted the Cominform's resolution: "In the history of the international working-class movement, the unity of the working class, both within individual countries and on a global scale, has never been as decisive as it is now. The unity of the working class is a necessary condition for ensuring peace, thwarting the evil schemes of the warmongers, defeating the imperialists' conspiracies against democracy and socialism, preventing the establishment of fascist rule, resolutely countering the monopoly capital's crusade against the vital interests of the working class, and ensuring the improvement of the economic conditions of the working masses."

*Pravda* pointed out that the post-war era is characterized by remarkable achievements in the struggle to strengthen proletarian solidarity. The World Federation of Trade Unions, with 72 million members, has emerged on the international stage for the first time in history as a unified international proletarian trade union organization. However, the American and British imperialists, in the process of preparing for a new war, are using various means to attempt to undermine the unity of trade unions of various countries specifically embodied in the World Federation of Trade Unions.

*Pravda* wrote: The Cominform resolution puts forward a broad program for achieving the unity of the working class and all democratic forces, and points out that the best way to achieve the unity of the working class is to unite the working class from below, so that all sections of the working class act in unison to defend the vital interests of the broad masses. For this purpose, it is urgently necessary to involve all workers, regardless of party affiliation, trade union membership, or religious belief, in the common struggle for the vital needs of the working people and for the interests of peace and democracy.

The Cominform resolution also emphasizes that in order to mobilize the broad masses to fight against American and British imperialism and domestic reactionaries, it is necessary to achieve the national unity of all democratic forces. Communist and Workers' Parties must constantly work in various mass organizations, such as women's, youth, peasant, cooperative, and other organizations.

*Pravda* concluded: The organizational, ideological, and political unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties on the principles of Marxism-Leninism is a necessary condition of paramount importance for the working class to carry out a victorious struggle for the unity within its own ranks, for the cause of peace, for the national independence of their own countries, and for democracy and socialism.

### 加强世界工人阶级团结　保卫和平击败战争贩子  真理报著文评论情报局决议

　　加强世界工人阶级团结
  　保卫和平击败战争贩子
    真理报著文评论情报局决议
    【新华社北京六日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于四日以“争取工人阶级团结的斗争”为题发表社论，评论共产党与工人党情报局关于工人阶级的团结与共产党和工人党的任务的决议。
    真理报首先引述情报局的决议说：“在国际工人阶级运动的历史上，工人阶级在一国范围内以及在世界范围内的团结，从来没有象现在这样具有决定意义。工人阶级的团结，乃是保障和平、挫败战争贩子的罪恶计谋、击败帝国主义者对民主与社会主义的阴谋、制止建立法西斯的统治方法、坚决反击垄断资本反对工人阶级切身利益的十字军及确保劳动大众经济条件之改善的必要条件。”
    真理报指出：战后年代的特点，就是在加强无产阶级团结的斗争中所获得的殊堪注意的成就。拥有七千二百万会员的世界工联，已作为国际无产阶级统一的工会组织在历史上头一次出现于国际舞台上。然而，美英帝国主义者则正在准备新战争的过程中，运用种种手段企图破坏具体表现在世界工联中的各国工会的团结。
    真理报写道：情报局决议提出了达到工人阶级和一切民主力量之团结的广泛的纲领，指出了达到工人阶级团结的最好的途径是：使工人阶级从下面团结起来，使工人阶级的各个部分为保卫广大群众的切身利益而一致行动。为此目的，急须不分党派、不分所属工会或宗教信仰，把全体工人卷入为劳动人民切身需要、为和平与民主的利益而进行的共同斗争中。
    情报局决议并着重指出为要动员广大群众对美英帝国主义及国内反动派作斗争的目的，必须要达到一切民主力量的全国大团结。共产党及工人党必须经常在各个群众组织，如妇女、青年、农民、合作及其他组织中进行工作。
    真理报最后写道：共产党及工人党在马列主义原则之上的组织上、思想上与政治上的团结，对于工人阶级为自己队伍内部的团结、为和平事业、为他们本国的民族独立、为民主与社会主义而进行胜利斗争来说，是具有头等重要性的必要条件。
