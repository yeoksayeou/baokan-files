In the short three days, the meeting proceeded intensely, and participants gained a profound understanding of the general principle of sanitary work, which is prevention-oriented, treatment-supplemented, and establishing connections between the two. Regarding specific methods for implementing the spirit of the National Health Conference, it was decided to run sanitary experimental zones well in order to promote overall work: run sanitary work well in several major industrial and mining areas in the Northeast; establish sanitary experimental counties in each province; carry out rural sanitation work, mobilize and educate medical personnel to go to the countryside to help farmers establish family health plans. The meeting believed that to improve the sanitary conditions of rural families, it is necessary to strengthen women's work, especially housewives, organize them, select a health group leader for every ten families, formulate sanitary regulations, and organize women and children to take turns checking sanitation on duty. Those with good results should be publicly commended by the district health center. In the army, it is required to establish the health work of the National Defense Force, and each division should create a model health battalion; bathhouses should be established in garrison areas; the nutrition of soldiers should be improved; and the health knowledge of army cadres should be educated and improved. Regarding the issue of cadre training, it was decided that in addition to establishing intermediate medical schools in various provinces and cities, and intermediate medical schools attached to various medical universities, primary medical personnel should also be widely trained in various places.
