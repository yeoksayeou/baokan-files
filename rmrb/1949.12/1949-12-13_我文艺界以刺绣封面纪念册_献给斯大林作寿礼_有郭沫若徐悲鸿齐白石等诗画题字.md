Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: Chinese literary and art figures have meticulously crafted an embroidery-covered commemorative album to celebrate Marshal Stalin's seventieth birthday. The album was entrusted to Simonov, the deputy head of the Soviet Cultural and Artistic Workers Delegation, who left Beijing on the evening of the 10th to be taken back to Moscow and presented to Marshal Stalin. Inside the album is Guo Moruo's birthday poem "Long Live Stalin," a black ink painting by Xu Beihong titled "Running Towards the Sun" depicting a horse, and a pine tree entitled "As Flourishing as Pine and Cypress," a color painting of peaches by the 89-year-old artist Qi Baishi titled "One Fruit Three Thousand Years," as well as paintings by Ye Qianyu, Wu Zuoren, Wang Shikui, and others, inscriptions by Mao Dun and Tian Han, and the signatures of Chinese writers.

The full text of Guo Moruo's birthday poem is as follows:

Long Live Stalin
Great Stalin, dear steel, eternal sun!
Humanity has you, and Marxism-Leninism can be developed today;
Humanity has you, and the proletariat can thrive today;
Humanity has you, and the cause of liberation can be glorious today.
It is you who leads us to move towards the ocean of the Great Harmony;
It is you who educates us that the West must not forget the East;
It is you who unites us, forming an unprecedented force.
The Soviet Union, with its fortress of peace, stands firm, incomparably strong;
The new democratic countries of Asia and Europe are continuously flourishing;
The People's Republic of China is newly emerging, emitting immense light.
The content of human history has been replaced with a brand new chapter;
The order of nature will also submit to the direction of revolution;
Stalin's name will forever become the sun of mankind.
Long live! Great Stalin! Long live! Dear steel.

　　我文艺界以刺绣封面纪念册
  　献给斯大林作寿礼
    有郭沫若徐悲鸿齐白石等诗画题字
    【新华社北京十二日电】中国文艺界人士为祝贺斯大林大元帅七十寿辰，特精制刺绣封面的纪念册一本，托十日晚离京的苏联文化艺术工作者代表团副团长西蒙诺夫带回莫斯科送交斯大林大元帅。纪念册内有郭沫若的祝寿诗：“斯大林万岁”，徐悲鸿墨笔画的题为“奔向太阳”的马和“如松柏之茂”的松，八十九岁老画家齐白石题为“一实三千年”的彩色画桃，和叶浅予、吴作人、王式廓等人的画，茅盾、田汉的题字和中国作家们的签名。
    郭沫若祝寿诗原文如下：
    斯大林万岁
    伟大的斯大林，亲爱的钢，永恒的太阳！
    人类有了你，马列主义才能有今天的发扬；
    人类有了你，无产阶级才能有今天的茁壮；
    人类有了你，解放事业才能有今天的辉煌。
    是你领导着我们，朝宗于大同世界的海洋；
    是你教育着我们，西方切莫要忘记了东方；
    是你团结着我们，形成了史无前例的力量。
    有和平堡垒的苏联，屹立着，无比坚强，
    有亚欧新民主国家，蝉联着，蒸蒸日上；
    有中华人民共和国，新吐着，万丈光芒。
    人类史的内容，已经改换了崭新的篇章；
    自然界的序列，也将服从于革命的方向；
    斯大林的名号，永远成为了人类的太阳。
    万岁！伟大的斯大林！万岁！亲爱的钢。
