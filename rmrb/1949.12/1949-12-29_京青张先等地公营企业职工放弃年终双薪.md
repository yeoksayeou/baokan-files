Public enterprise workers in Beijing, Qingdao, Zhangjiakou, and other places voluntarily forgo year-end double pay
Workers of the world are one family; we forgo our double pay so the government can build more factories and unemployed workers can also have jobs.

[Report from this newspaper] Responding to the decision issued by the Financial and Economic Commission regarding the handling of year-end double pay or bonuses, the Fengtai Cement Component Factory Trade Union held a general meeting of all employees on December 24. All employees unanimously agreed that, in order to consolidate state power, to support the front lines, to liberate the entire country and restore production as soon as possible, and to embark on a high tide of economic construction, the working class must endure temporary difficulties. With the spirit of enduring hardship, working hard, practicing thrift, and building a prosperous home, they are determined to voluntarily forgo all of this year's year-end double pay and contribute it to the People's Government, in order to overcome the current financial difficulties of the country during the victory process. The speeches at the meeting were very enthusiastic. Worker An Deming said, "In the past, under the Kuomintang, we couldn't even buy a bag of flour when we got paid. After liberation, we switched to calculating in terms of millet, and we could buy four or five bags of flour in a month. The People's Government takes such good care of us even under very difficult economic conditions. In order to support our own government, I have decided to forgo my double pay and ask the government to use it to do more things that benefit the people!" Worker Li Huanwen said, "Regarding the year-end double pay, I had a democratic discussion at home with my wife and convinced her to give up her selfish ideas. For the long-term interests of the workers, it's better to buy one less piece of clothing for the children and give the money to the state." Worker Yan Enpu said, "There are still many workers who cannot find suitable jobs and are suffering from unemployment. Based on the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship among workers of the world, we should help them. Therefore, we are giving up our double pay so that the People's Government can use the money to build more factories so that everyone has food to eat." Worker Song Huanchen further expressed his determination, saying, "Not only do we not want double pay, but we also want to strive to make more contributions on the production front." The speeches became more and more enthusiastic, and several people were even vying to speak at the same time. Worker Kang Lianwu simply shouted directly, "I don't want it either!" Then a chorus of "don't want it" mingled with applause. In order to carefully solicit the opinions of the employees, the trade union decided to ask those who had not spoken or had not fully expressed their views to write down what they wanted to say. As a result, they all unanimously expressed their firm determination to give up their double pay. The enthusiasm of the employees in supporting their government and safeguarding the long-term interests of the working class has been more concretely demonstrated this time.

[Report from this newspaper] All employees of the Beijing Waterworks Company responded to the government's call and did not receive year-end bonuses. The employees understood that the government still had financial difficulties and that the task of production and construction was heavy. They resolutely did not receive bonuses and would further intensify their work to complete the new tasks for 1950.

　　京青张先等地公营企业职工放弃年终双薪
    天下工人是一家，我们放弃双薪，让政府多办几个工厂，使失业工人也有工可作
    【本报讯】响应财经委员会发出关于年终双薪或奖金处理办法的决定，丰台洋灰筑件厂工会于十二月二十四日召开全体职工座谈会。全体职工一致认为，为了巩固国家政权，为了支援前线，使全国早日解放，早日恢复生产，走上经济建设高潮，工人阶级要忍受一时困难，以吃得苦、作得多、节衣缩食、刻苦兴家的精神，坚决将今年年终应得的双薪，全部自动放弃，贡献给人民政府，以克服目前胜利过程中国家财经的困难。会上发言非常热烈，工友安德明说：“过去在国民党时代，每到发薪还买不到一袋面，解放后改按小米计算，那一个月都可买四、五袋面了；人民政府在经济非常困难条件下，还这样照顾我们，为了拥护自己的政权，所以我决计放弃双薪，请政府拿它去做更多有益于人民的事业吧！”工友李焕文说：“关于年终双薪事，曾经和老婆在家里开了一次民主讨论会，说服了她的为个人打算思想，为了工人的长远利益，还是少给小孩买件衣裳，而把钱送给国家的好。”工友阎恩普说：“现在还有很多的工人，正在找不到适当的工作，遭受失业的痛苦，本天下的工人是一家互助友爱的精神，我们应当援助他们，所以我们放弃双薪，人民政府可拿这钱多办几个工厂，使大家都有饭吃。”工友宋焕臣更进一步作表了示说：“不但不要双薪，而且还要在生产战线上争取多立功。”发言越来越踊跃，竟至好几个人同时都抢着说。工友康连午索性直截了当地喊出：“我也不要！”于是一片“不要”声音夹杂着掌声响成一团。工会为慎重征求职工们的意见，决定请没有发言或发言未尽意的人，将自己要说的话写出来。结果仍是不约而同地一致表示坚决放弃双薪。职工们拥护自己的政府、保障工人阶级长远利益的热诚，这一次更具体地表现出来了。（丰台洋灰筑件厂工会通讯组）
