　　Encouraging Private Merchants to Purchase Goods from Other Places
  　People's Bank of China Beijing Branch Increases Inter-port Advance Exchange
    Operating Banks Covering Fifty Cities and Counties
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to develop the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and to assist private merchants to purchase goods from producing areas or distribution centers to adjust the supply and demand of goods in various regions, the People's Bank of China Beijing Branch has begun to increase inter-port import and export advance exchange business in its business department starting this month. Based on the distribution of goods and the laws of circulation, the first batch of selected operating banks are: Tianjin, Tangshan, Baoding, Anguo, Xinji, Bozhen, Cangxian, Linqing, Handan, Nangong, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang (all of the above in Hebei Province), Xinxiang, Anyang, Liaocheng, Xianzhuang (all of the above in Pingyuan Province), Taiyuan (Shanxi Province), Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xuchang (all of the above in Henan Province), Zhangjiakou, Datong (Chahar Province), GuiSui, Baotou, Xinning, Fengzhen (Suiyuan Province), Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Yantai, Weifang, Jining, Zibo, Zhoucun, Yidu (all of the above in Shandong Province), Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou, Songjiang, Taizhou, Yangzhou, Nantong (all of the above in Jiangsu Province), Hangzhou (Zhejiang Province), Changsha (Hunan Province), Xi'an (Shaanxi Province), Hefei, Tunxi (Anhui Province) and other fifty cities and counties. Since the bank started this business, Yufengyuan, Tongli and other oil factories, Futong Grain Depot and other dozens of businesses have come to contact us. The areas that merchants want to go to for purchasing are: Bengbu, Luohe, Handan, Shangqiu, Taiyuan, Jinan, Datong and other places. In addition to food (rice), most of the goods to be purchased are industrial raw materials such as: peanuts, sesame, tobacco leaves, flax, gypsum, etc. According to recent merchant feedback and the department's investigation: there are still some difficulties in carrying out this business, such as the weak financial resources of private merchants, the unfamiliarity of Beijing merchants with advance exchange business, the abnormal transportation, and the lack of widespread insurance institutions. The department has begun to improve based on the existing problems, in order to gradually improve the situation. Regarding the difficulty of capital turnover for applicants, the bank has modified the original regulations. Importers who find a reliable guarantor locally can first use funds from the People's Bank of the purchasing location. As for the time limit for purchasing certificates, the bank can also make appropriate adjustments to take care of the importer's difficulties.

  　人民银行北京分行增办埠际押汇
    经办行处遍及五十市县
    【本报讯】人民银行北京分行为开展城乡物资交流，协助私商至各产地或集散地进行采购，以调剂各地物产供需，于本月份起由营业部增办埠际进出口押汇业务。根据物资集散情况及流转规律，首批选择：天津、唐山、宝定、安国、辛集、泊镇、沧县、临清、邯郸、南宫、邢台、石家庄（以上河北省），新乡、安阳、聊城、仙庄（以上平原省），太原（山西省），开封、郑州、许昌（以上河南省），张家口、大同（察省），归绥、包头、信宁、丰镇（绥远省），济南、青岛、徐州、烟台、潍坊、济宁、淄博、周村、益都（以上山东省），南京、上海、无锡、镇江、苏州、常州、松江、泰州、扬州、南通（以上江苏省），杭州（浙江省），长沙（湖南省），西安（陕西省），合肥、屯溪（安徽省）等五十个市、县人民银行为办理押汇行处。该行自开始此项业务后，连日有裕丰源、同力等油厂，阜通粮栈等十数行业前往接洽，各商欲前往采购之地区有：蚌埠、漯河、邯郸、商邱、太原、济南、大同等处。欲采购之物品除食粮（大米）外大部为工业原料如：花生、芝麻、烟叶、胡麻、石膏等。根据近来商人反映及该部调查：进行此项业务目前尚存在若干困难，如私商资力较弱，京市商人对押汇业务生疏以及交通尚不正常，保险机构设立不普遍等。该部根据现存问题开始改进，以期逐步改善。关于申请商资金周转困难方面，该行已变通原有规定。进口商就地觅得妥实铺保，得向采购地人民银行先行用款。至购买证之期限，为照顾进口商困难，亦可酌予伸缩。
