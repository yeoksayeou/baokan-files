Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 30th: According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly, in its plenary session on November 20, discussed the so-called "Interim Committee" (Little General Assembly) issue and, in violation of the United Nations Charter, passed an illegal resolution for the "Interim Committee" to exist indefinitely. When this issue was still being discussed in the Special Political Committee, the Soviet delegation convincingly proved that the activities of this committee, established at the proposal of the United States, are aimed at subverting the United Nations and at weakening and abolishing the Security Council, which has been entrusted with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. However, U.S. representative Austin insisted on extending the work of the Interim Committee "on an experimental basis and for an indefinite time."

Polish representative Katz-Suchy reiterated: The majority of votes cannot force us to change our negative attitude towards the Interim Committee. The only decision we can accept is to dissolve this committee. There can be no compromise on the Interim Committee. Soviet representative Tsarapkin analyzed the report of the Interim Committee and, based on other facts, explained that the activities of the Interim Committee will further deteriorate the situation in the United Nations. The Soviet delegation will, as before, not participate in the work of the Interim Committee, nor will it recognize its decisions, recommendations, or conclusions.

Neither the U.S. delegation nor the other countries supporting it were able to provide any satisfactory justification for the continued existence of the Interim Committee. However, the U.S.-British bloc used its voting machine to have the General Assembly accept its proposal to extend the work of the Interim Committee. The United States and its followers have once again undermined the United Nations Charter.

　　美帝续谋破坏安理会“小型联大”又延长
  　苏波坚持反对
    【新华社北京三十日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会全体会议于十一月二十日讨论所谓“临时委员会”（小型联大）的问题，并违背联合国宪章的规定，通过“临时委员会”无限期存在的非法决议。当这一问题尚在特别政治委员会中讨论时，苏联代表团令人信服地证明：在美国提议下建立的这个委员会的活动，是旨在颠覆联合国，旨在削弱和废除已经委以维持国际和平与安全的主要责任的安理会。但美国代表奥斯汀仍坚持在“试验性的基础上与无限的时间里”，延长临时委员会的工作。
    波兰代表卡兹·苏琪重宣称：大多数的表决也不能迫使我们改变我们对于临时委员会的否定态度。有一个决定是我们所能接受的，就是解散这个委员会。对临时委员会不可能有任何妥协。苏联代表查拉普金分析临时委员会的报告，并根据其他事实说明：临时委员会的活动将使联合国的形势更为恶化。苏联代表团将象以前一样地不参加临时委员会的工作，也不承认它的决定、建议或结论。
    无论是美国代表团或支持它的其它国家，都不能够提出辩护临时委员会继续存在的任何令人满意的证明。但美英集团仍然以其表决机器大会接受其关于延长临时委员会工作的提案。美国及其随从又一次地破坏了联合国宪章。
