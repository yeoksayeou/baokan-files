　　Huaibei Agricultural Machinery General Factory
  　Learning from the Soviet Union's Experience in Enterprise Management Special Responsibility System

    Since the Huaibei Agricultural Machinery General Factory implemented the production special responsibility system in August, the four months of production have made us deeply realize a truth: to run a people's factory well, we must learn from the Soviet Union's advanced enterprise management and technology. Our special responsibility system is one of the scientific management systems of Soviet factories that we are learning from.
    The predecessor of the Huaibei Agricultural Machinery General Factory was a gun factory that had been severely damaged by the enemy. At that time, most of the factory's engine was stolen and sold by the enemy, the surrounding walls were pushed down, and the warehouse was almost completely looted. I remember when the military control committee's receiving team came to the factory, there wasn't even coal for cooking. We had to ask the workers' families to steam corn buns for us. Without tables and chairs, we held meetings sitting on the ground. But at that time, the favorable condition was that the worker comrades had returned to the factory. They actively demanded the resumption of production and voluntarily contributed their preserved valuable tools, engines, and raw materials. Many difficulties were gradually overcome under the condition that we closely relied on the workers. And in the seven months, manufacturing agricultural machinery achieved considerable results. But at the same time, we also discovered some shortcomings in production, such as unplanned and temporary grabbing, material requisition without formal procedures, serious waste, which affected the inability to make accurate cost calculations, and lax labor discipline, wasting working hours, etc. After democratic discussion, everyone reached a consensus on these shortcomings, and then proposed to learn from the Soviet Union's scientific industrial management system, and proposed to first solve the problem of the production special responsibility system.
    The difficulties encountered in implementing the special responsibility system: first, it was reflected in the all-in-one system of production. The engineering department did not have a clear division of labor in various tasks such as production and manufacturing, design and research. Everyone pitched in when something happened, and there was no plan for work. Due to the all-in-one system of engineering, workers were also trapped in grabbing everything in production, which greatly hindered the improvement of technology and the increase of output. According to the spirit of the special responsibility system, the organization was reorganized. The engineering department was divided into two groups: production and manufacturing, and design and research. The production and manufacturing group was divided into three workshops and two sections, and each workshop was divided into subgroups according to the specific tasks of the production plan, such as the casting workshop being divided into water pump group, weeding hoe group, copper smelting group, and odd jobs group. Each production subgroup democratically elected a subgroup leader, and the tasks within the group were specified to each worker to be specifically responsible for. Secondly, the cadres had great concerns about the special responsibility system in their thinking, lacked confidence, were afraid of taking responsibility, and did not order production plans according to production capacity, trying to order as little as possible to avoid being criticized for not completing the task. For this reason, we deeply studied the scientific methods of managing factories collected from various places, and the cadres reached a consensus in their thinking before entering the movement. Therefore, we feel that the beginning of implementing the special responsibility system should have a strict production organization, detailed scientific division of labor, and a certain ideological foundation among the masses, in order to exert effectiveness in production.
    At the beginning of entering the special responsibility system, a preliminary draft of the production plan for one month was formulated based on the production capacity, and the tasks of each production subgroup were divided. The draft was sent to each subgroup for discussion, so that the workers could fully express their opinions and revise the draft production plan. Then, the production and manufacturing group convened a meeting of subgroup leaders to jointly decide on the entire production plan, and wrote the production plan in the most conspicuous place in the factory, so that every comrade would always remember their tasks, and at the same time, the masses could understand our production situation and check our work. Since August, our production plans have been completed on schedule and always ahead of schedule and exceeded.
    The implementation of the special responsibility system also strengthened the coordination of work between the various sections and groups. The work preparation section formulated a material requisition plan in advance according to the production plan and handed it over to the warehouse. The warehouse ensured the supply of materials, and the procurement ensured the replenishment of materials and tools, gradually achieving accurate statistics of material requisition and working hours, laying a good foundation for establishing cost accounting. Therefore, after implementing the special responsibility system, we put forward the slogan of reducing costs by 25%.
    In coordination with the production special responsibility system, we mobilized everyone to run the trade union and strengthen labor protection work, worker welfare, especially strengthening the work of the medical office, and put forward the movement to reduce sick leave. As a result, in August and September, when there were the most illnesses, sick leave was reduced by 50%. In November, we further proposed the movement to eliminate work-related injuries, checked labor safety, and called on the workers to discuss in depth how to eliminate work-related injuries to ensure the health and safety of the workers, which played a significant role in ensuring increased production efficiency.
    The management of the workshops gradually entered the process of absorbing the Soviet Union's scientific management system, establishing detailed daily work report forms, detailed recording the production records of each worker in each production subgroup, establishing a precise timekeeping system for each job, to formulate various standard quotas, preparing for over-quota rewards and entering the basis of piece-rate wages. Establishing a strict material system, material requisition must be based on the material plan, and must have certain material requisition procedures, to completely eliminate waste of materials. Establishing a finished product and semi-finished product inspection system, setting up a semi-finished product warehouse, formulating standards to inspect semi-finished products to eliminate defective rework, so that the assembly work moves towards a scientific interchange system. Finished products are not allowed to be put into the warehouse without final inspection and testing, ensuring the quality of the finished products, so that each finished product must be durable and practical.
    Establishing a conscious labor discipline, the administrative trade union formed a labor discipline committee, discussed a preliminary draft, submitted it to the subgroups for discussion and approval, and then strictly implemented it. Every day, the list of latecomers and absentees was announced, and leave had to be approved by the subgroup first, and the trade union and administrative departments reviewed it. Workers who did not ask for leave were given a monthly bonus, and labor discipline was strengthened on the basis of clear and fair rewards and punishments.
    In the first stage of implementing the special responsibility system, some achievements were immediately shown, and the production volume of the entire factory was rising in a straight line. In terms of foundry output, from August to September, the number of workers increased from 47 to 53, and the output actually increased from 18 tons to 28 tons; in October, only 4 workers were added, and the output could reach 49 tons. The workers demonstrated a high degree of production enthusiasm and creativity in production. During the period of the puppet regime, the steel rolling department never allowed workers to understand how to design and manufacture templates and rollers, but today, thanks to the workers' high degree of wisdom, they can design and roll out various specifications of flat iron and square iron by themselves, and find ways to solve the material problems of manufacturing agricultural machinery at any time, which played a decisive role in production. In mid-October, the steel rolling furnace suddenly broke down, and the workers automatically worked overtime for one Sunday and night to repair it. The workers helped each other in their work and launched challenges and competitions. For example, the assembly of the Liberation-style weeding hoe, under the leadership of League member Yang Yinghai, created a new record of 15 minutes per unit, while the assembly time of the first unit was 640 minutes. Another example is that under the mutual competition between Wang Pusun and Yan Chunnian on the front wheel of the weeding hoe, the number of pieces increased from 7 pieces per day to 22 pieces, and in November it increased to 27 pieces, which is almost four times higher. Comrade Xu Zizheng first created four kinds of tools, such as the work of planing the keyway of the water pump wheel. Because Xu Zizheng used special tools, the number increased from one per hour to ten. Riveter Jia Wenyuan came up with the idea of using a steam hammer to rivet the side blades of the weeding hoe, which increased the speed by more than ten times. In terms of forging, the collective creation of tools reduced all weeding hoe forgings from 14 work to 0.8 work, fully demonstrating the workers' endless wisdom.
    Due to the great increase in production efficiency, the cost has generally been reduced by more than 20%. The manufacturing of a water pump has been reduced from 121 work to 48 work, saving 73 work; saving 60 catties of pig iron, totaling 1,200 catties of millet. The manufacturing of a weeding hoe has been reduced from 19 work to 3.12 work, saving 7 catties of flat iron, saving a total of 260 catties of millet, reducing the cost by 50%. Due to overcoming the waste of materials and saving other indirect materials, it has further reduced from 20% of the direct cost to 7%.
    In October, in order to deepen the production special responsibility system, we learned from the management experience of the Sino-Soviet joint venture factory in Dalian, and according to our specific situation, we took the special responsibility system movement to a higher level.
    Establishing a daily report system, the responsible comrades of each section and office gathered in the director's office half an hour before work every day to report on the work plan for the day. The meeting time was half an hour, and the meeting was adjourned when work began. Make a speech outline in advance and raise the problems that need to be solved, so as to immediately solve the difficulties and immediately carry out the tasks, strengthening mutual understanding and connection between work. In this way, everyone's daily work has been considered, planned and arranged in advance, and a summary review has been made afterwards, basically overcoming the past phenomenon of unplanned, scattered, slack when nothing happened and busy and chaotic when something happened.
    In order to implement the special responsibility system, inspectors were set up to strictly enforce the inspection system under the direct leadership of the factory director. At the same time, it was emphasized that the mass line of inspection work should be relied on to do a good job of inspection, and problems should be discussed and solved with the person concerned first. Inspectors are not monitors, and they must sincerely help everyone do their job well, so that everyone can consciously accept the inspector's inspection. At the end of each month, the factory director, engineer, section chiefs, trade union director and inspectors form an inspection team. All kinds of finished products are thoroughly inspected, and finally the production task for the month is considered to have been handed over only after the inspector signs. The manufacture of a machine has gone through the inspection of the group's work inspection section and the final inspection by the inspector, two procedures, which has a great effect on improving the quality of the finished product.
    Strict labor discipline, criticism will be given for being late for five minutes. Establishing a sign-in system for employees and cadres, and strictly prohibiting meetings during production hours. Since its implementation, the past scattered style has been changed, and no one has been late in the past two months. In particular, before all the employees got up, the leading comrades had already finished the half-hour daily report meeting, and this exemplary role gave the comrades a great impression, so it is said that the exemplary role of leading cadres is important for the implementation of a system.
    Establishing an independent accounting system, establishing various budget systems, the accountant has the right to stop paying any amount exceeding the budget, and has the right to stop paying any additional expenses, even if the factory director uses it, it is not allowed. At the same time, a certain amount is also stipulated for employees to borrow wages. Since its implementation, the situation of borrowing has been greatly reduced, from more than ten people a day to two or three people, and no more than 1,000 catties of rice per month, strengthening the audit work. Due to the strict implementation of the accounting system, management expenses in October were reduced by half compared with September, and various incorrect expenses were stopped.
    However, when we summarized the work of the special responsibility system in the previous stage, we found that the mass base of the special responsibility system was not enough, and the group leaders did not combine well with the masses, so that the special responsibility system did not take root among the masses and could not exert a greater effect. This was because the leadership did not go deep enough into the worker masses, and did not persist in timely commendation and reward of model work, so that many worker comrades felt that no matter how actively they produced, the leadership could not see it. At this time, we first carried out the work of the Party and the League, and further discussed at the group leader meeting how to deepen the special responsibility system and how to improve it further, stipulating that the factory director should report on administrative work to all workers every week, and let the workers make suggestions to improve administrative leadership. It was proposed in the Party and the League that each Party and League member should become the core of the mass movement of the production special responsibility system, and each person should unite more than three activists. After a period of brewing, the movement to create new records in the entire factory was finally formed, proposing extra rewards for creating records, special bonuses for encouraging the improvement of technology, mobilizing activists to strive for models, and helping other workers to strive for models, proposing to combine this movement to develop the Communist Youth League. Heated discussions were launched in each subgroup. League members Mi Derui and Wang Wentao of the forging subgroup actively led the masses to discuss the conditions for selecting models. Each group also widely brewed to strive for a model group in the movement to create new records. The apprentice group led by League member Yang Yinghai proposed to strive for a model group in the movement. The steel rolling group automatically increased the task from 20 tons per month to 30 tons to solve the difficulty of weeding hoe materials, and also strived to exceed the task to grab the red flag. The foundry weeding hoe subgroup led by League member Lu Fu proposed to complete the task of 800 weeding hoes, which is almost 400 work, with the strength of nine group members, and strive for a model group.
    Due to the development of the mass movement to create new records, amazing achievements have been made in the first ten days of November. The task of the forging workshop for half a month has been completed in ten days. The amount of molten iron in the foundry has increased from 1.5 tons per day to 2.5 tons to 3 tons. Fitter Yang Guangyu, together with Meng Guangsheng, welded weeding hoe handles, increasing from 150 units per day to 400 units per day. The highest record of welding tooth rods was achieved from 56 pieces per day to 191 pieces. The skin was peeled off by the purple light, but he was still unwilling to rest for a while. Foundry workers Gao Yunfeng and Wang Deshan transformed a discarded furnace into a copper melting furnace to replace the use of @ to melt copper. The ratio of coke to copper was increased from one catty of coke melting 2.05 catties of copper to 5.1 catties of copper. The time required was reduced by two times, and the quality of the copper was improved, reducing defective work. This record-breaking movement has broken the small circle of a few activists and formed a mass movement combined with the specific system of extra rewards. Now this movement to create records is still continuing to develop.

　　华北农业机械总厂
  　学习苏联企业管理专责制的经验
    孙景鲁
    华北农业机械总厂自八月份实行生产专责制，四个月的生产过程中使我们深切的体会到一个真理，办好一个人民的工厂，必须学习苏联先进的企业管理与技术，我们的专责制就是学习的苏联工厂的科学管理制度之一。
    华北农械总厂的前身，是一个敌人的破坏不成样子的造枪厂，在当时厂房的发动机大部被敌人盗卖，围墙被敌人推倒，仓库几被偷盗一空。记得军管会接管组来厂接收时，连做饭用的煤都没有，只好请工人家属代蒸窝窝头。没有棹椅就坐在地上开会，但当时有利的条件是工人同志们回到了工厂，他们积极要求恢复生产，并且自动献出保存的贵重工具发动机和原料，许多困难都在我们紧紧依靠工人的条件下逐渐克服了。并在七个月的过程中制造农业机械，获得相当成绩。但同时我们在生产中也发现了一些缺点，如无计划临时乱抓，领料不经过正式手续，严重的浪费现象，因而影响不能作出精确成本，劳动纪律不严格浪费工时等。这些缺点经过民主讨论，大家认识一致了，才提出学习苏联科学的工业管理制度，提出首先要解决生产专责制的问题。
    在实行专责制遇到的困难：首先是表现在生产上的一揽子制度，工务科在生产制造与设计研究各种工作上都没有明确的分工，有事齐下手，工作无计划，由于工务上的一揽子制度，工人在生产上也陷于乱抓一把，对提高技术，增加产量发生极大的障碍。根据专责制的精神重新调整了组织，工务科分生产制造与设计研究两组，生产制造组下设三场两股，各场又按生产计划的具体任务分成小组，如铸工场分成水泵组，耘锄组，铜冶组，零活组，各生产小组经过民主选举小组长，组内再把任务具体到每个工人专门负责。其次是干部思想上对专责制有很大顾虑，没信心，怕负责任，订生产计划不按生产能力订，尽量少订免得完不成任务受批评。为此我们深入地学习了各地搜集来的管理工厂的科学办法，干部思想取得一致后才进入运动。所以我们感觉实行专责制的开始应该有严密的生产组织，细密的科学分工，和群众一定的思想基础，才能在生产上发挥效能。
    进入专责制的开始，根据生产能力初步拟定一个月的生产计划草案，并且划分各生产小组的任务，把草案送交各小组讨论，使工人充分发表意见修正生产计划草案。然后由生产制造组召集小组长开会，共同决定整个的生产计划，并将生产计划写在厂内最显著的地方，让每个同志都时时刻刻记着自己的任务，同时可以让群众了解我们的生产情况和检查我们的工作。从八月份起我们的生产计划都是如期完成而且总是提前与超过。
    专责制的推行同时加强了各课组间工作的配合，工作准备股根据生产计划预先制定了用料计划交给仓库，仓库保证了材料的供给，采购又保证了材料工具的补充，逐渐做到领料与工时的精确统计，给建立成本核算打好了基础，所以在实行专责制后我们便提出了减低成本百分之廿五的号召。
    配合生产专责制发动大家办工会，加强劳保工作，工人福利，特别是加强医务室的工作，提出减少病号运动。结果在疾病最多的八、九月份，减少病号百分之五十。十一月份更提出消灭公伤运动，检查劳动安全，号召工人群众深入讨论如何消灭公伤来保证工人的健康与安全，这在保证增加生产效能上起了显著的作用。
    工场的管理方面逐步进入吸取苏联科学化管理制度，建立详密的每日工作日报单，详细纪录每生产小组的每个工人的生产纪录，建立精确的每件工作的记工记时制度，来制定各种标准定额，准备作超额奖励和进入到计件工资的基础。建立严格材料制度，领料必须依据材料计划，必须有一定领料手续，来彻底消灭材料上的浪费现象。建立成品半成品检查制度，设立半成品仓库，制定标准检查半成品消灭废活反工，使装配工作走向科学的互换制。成品最后不经过检查试验不准入库，保证成品的质量，使每件成品一定能耐久实用。
    建立自觉的劳动纪律，由行政工会组成劳动纪律委员会，讨论出初步草案，交小组讨论通过再严格执行。每天公布迟到旷工的名单，请假必须先经小组通过，工会、行政方面审核，不请假的每月给予奖工，在奖罚明确公平的基础上加强了劳动纪律。
    当实行专责制的头一阶段里，即表现了一些成绩，全厂的生产量是直线式上升。就翻砂产量来说，从八月到九月工人从四十七人增加到五十三人，而产量竟从十八吨加到廿八吨；到十月份工人仅仅加了四名，而产量能达到四十九吨。工人在生产中发挥了高度的生产热诚及创造性。轧钢部在敌伪时期是从来不让工人了解怎样来设计制造样板和滚子的，而今天由于工人发挥了高度的智慧，能自己设计轧出各种规格的扁铁、方铁、随时设法解决制造农业机械的材料问题，在生产中起了决定性的作用。十月中轧钢闷炉突然损坏，工人自动在一个星期日夜加班修好。工人们在工作中互助挑战发动竞赛，如解放式耘锄的装配工作，在团员杨瀛海同志带头号召下，以每部十五分钟创造了新纪录，而第一部装配的时间是六百四十分钟。又如耘锄前轮在王蒲逊、阎春年互相竞赛下，从每天七件涨到二十二件，十一月份提高到二十七件超过将达四倍。工人许子政同志首先创造四种工具，如刨水泵轮键槽工作，由于许子政利用了特殊工具，从每小时一个增加到十个。铆工贾文元想出了用汽锤来铆耘锄侧刀，使速度提高到十倍以上。锻工方面集体创造工具使全部耘锄锻件从十四工减到零点八工，充分发扬了工人无穷无尽的智慧。
    由于生产效能的大大提高，在成本上普遍地减低了百分之二十以上，制造一部水泵由一二一工减至四十八工，节省了七十三工；料节省了六十斤生铁，合计节省小米一千二百斤。制造一部耘锄从十九工减为三．一二工，料节省了七斤扁铁，共节省了二百六十斤小米，减低了成本百分之五十。由于克服了材料浪费的现象和其他间接用料的节省，更使从占直接成本之百分之二十减为百分之七。
    十月份为深入生产专责制，学习了大连中苏合办工厂的管理经验，根据我们的具体情况，把专责制运动再提高一步。
    建立日报制，各课组室负责同志每天在工作前半小时集合厂长室作今日工作计划报告，会议时间为半小时，上班时散会。事先做发言提纲和提出所需要解决的问题，做到立即解决困难，立即执行任务，加强了彼此了解和工作间的连系。这样就使每人每天工作都经过了事先考虑计划布置，事后作总结检讨，把过去没计划、散漫、没事松懈有事忙乱一把的现象，基本上克服了。
    为了贯彻专责制，设立检查员直接在厂长领导下严格执行检查制度。同时强调指出检查工作的群众路线，依靠群众作好检查工作，发现问题先和本人商量解决。检查员不是监视员，要很诚心的帮助每个人把工作作好，使每个人都能自觉的接受检查员的检查。每月月底由厂长、工程师、各课长、工会主任及检查员，组成检查小组，各种成品均经详细检查，最后由检查员签字才算交了一月生产任务。制成一件机械，经过本组工检股的检查，又经过检查员最后检查两道手续，这样在成品质量的提高上是有极大作用的。
    严格的劳动纪律，迟到五分钟即进行批评。建立职员干部签到制度，并严格的禁止在生产时间内开会。实行以来改变了过去一向散漫作风，两个月来没有迟到的。特别是在全体职工未起床之前，领导同志已将每日半小时日报会开完，这种模范作用给予同志们极大感动，所以说一种制度的执行，领导干部的模范作用是重要的。
    建立独立的会计制度，建立各种预算制度，会计有权停止支付任何超出预算的款项，有权停止支付任何额外的开支，即是厂长动用也不许可。同时对职工借薪也规定一定额数，实行以来借支情形大减，从每天十余人减到两三人，每月不超过一千斤米，加强了审核工作。由于会计制度的严格执行，管理费用十月份较九月份节省一半，停止了各种不正确的开支。
    但当我们总结前一阶段专责制工作的时候，发现专责制的群众基础不够，小组长没有很好的和群众结合起来，因而使专责制没在群众中扎下根基，不能发挥更大效果，这是由于领导上深入工人群众不够，和没有坚持及时进行表扬奖励模范的工作，使许多工人同志感觉无论生产怎样积极领导上看不出来。这时我们即首先进行了党和团的工作，并在小组长会议上进一步的讨论专责制如何深入与怎样再提高一步，规定出厂长每星期向全体工人同志作行政工作汇报，让工人同志提意见改进行政领导，在党、团中提出，每个党团员要成为生产专责制群众运动的核心，每人要团结三个以上的积极分子。经过一段酝酿最后形成全厂创造新纪录运动，提出创造纪录的超额奖励，鼓励提高技术的特别奖金，动员积极分子争取模范，帮助其他工友争取模范，提出结合这一运动发展青年团。在各小组中展开了热烈的讨论，锻工小组团员米德瑞、王文涛积极领导群众讨论选模范条件。各组并普遍酝酿，在创造新纪录运动中争取模范组。团员杨瀛海领导的徒弟组提出要在运动中争取模范组，轧钢组自动将任务从每月二十吨提高到三十吨，来解决耘锄材料的困难，还要争取超过任务来抢红旗。团员吕富领导的铸工耘锄小组，提出以九个组员的力量来完成将达四百工的八百部耘锄任务，争取模范组。
    由于创纪录群众运动的开展，十一月的最初十天中，已出现了惊人的成绩。锻工场半月的任务十天即已完成，铸工场熔铁量已从每天一吨半提高到二吨半到三吨，钳工杨光玉协同孟广生，电焊耘锄手柄，从每天一百五十部提高到每天四百部，电焊牙杆从每天五十六个达到一百九十一件的最高纪录，脸皮被紫光线照的脱了皮还是不肯稍微休息一会，铸工高云峰和王德山把一部废置了的废炉，改造成化铜炉代替用工＠来化铜，焦恢和铜的比率，从一斤焦炭化二．○五斤铜，提高到五．一斤铜，所需时间节省了两倍，而且铜的质量得到了改进，减少了废活。这次创纪录运动已经打破了少数积极分子的小圈子，结合了具体的超额奖励制度形成群众性的运动。现在这种创造纪录的运动还正在继续发展中。
