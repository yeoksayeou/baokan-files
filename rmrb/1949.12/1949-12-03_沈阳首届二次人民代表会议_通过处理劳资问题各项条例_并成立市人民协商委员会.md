Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th: The first second Shenyang Municipal People's Representative Conference was held from the 22nd to the 24th. A total of 318 representatives from all walks of life attended the meeting, with more than 50 personnel from various agencies attending as observers. The conference unanimously approved the "Provisional Measures for Handling Labor-Capital Relations," the "Provisional Procedures for Handling Labor-Capital Disputes," and the "Provisional Measures for Labor-Capital Parties of Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises to Conclude Collective Contracts." It also earnestly discussed the social relief work for this winter and established the Shenyang Municipal People's Consultative Committee.

Regarding social relief work for this winter, the conference resolved to establish a city-wide relief committee, electing Huang Oudong, Zhu Qiwen, and 23 others as relief committee members, and decided to carry out the work according to the following three principles: (1) Vagrants and beggars wandering the streets without homes or jobs should be taken in by the government; extreme paupers with homes but without means of living should be given on-the-spot assistance. (2) Social relief must be combined with the development of production and the transformation of vagrants. Thieves and unemployed vagrants should be centrally managed and educated to engage in production. The remainder will be handled separately by production and education institutions. (3) Extensive publicity should be carried out, calling on people from all walks of life in the city, as well as agencies and troops, to economize on food and clothing and actively donate to assist the relief committee in carrying out social relief. Fundraising must strictly adhere to the principle of voluntarism and must not be forcibly apportioned.

In order to facilitate consultation, implement the resolutions of the conference, closely connect with the people from all walks of life, and carry out the Shenyang Municipal Democratic United Front work during the recess of the People's Representative Conference, the conference finally approved the establishment of the Shenyang Municipal People's Consultative Committee, electing Zhu Qiwen, Jiao Ruoyu, Huang Oudong, Xu Zhi, Zhao Guoyou, Lu Guangji, and 13 others as members, and elected Zhu Qiwen as chairman, and Jiao Ruoyu, Xu Zhi, and Lu Guangji as vice-chairmen.
