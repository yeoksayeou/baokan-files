    Declaration of the Fifth National Cadre Meeting of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party:
    The Fifth National Cadre Meeting of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party successfully concluded on November 26, 1949, in the people's capital! All comrades of our party must first thank the Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader, Chairman Mao, for giving us wise guidance. The main task of our party in convening this meeting was to conduct an appropriate review of past struggles and to make correct decisions regarding the future direction of the entire party's efforts. Now, after lengthy and repeated discussions, we have adopted a number of resolutions on political and party affairs. All comrades of our party will take this as the guideline for their future work and actions and strive to implement it.
    We believe that in such a great historical stage as today, summarizing the 22 years of struggle of our party is a necessary and meaningful task. Each of our cadre meetings has determined our action policy based on the needs of each period of the revolution.
    In 1930, the First National Cadre Meeting was held in Shanghai under the personal leadership of Comrade Zheng Yanda, raising the banner of overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary rule headed by Chiang Kai-shek, establishing the political program of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and land revolution, and founding our party. Unfortunately, Comrade Zheng Yanda died heroically within two years.
    In 1935, we convened the Second Cadre Meeting in Hong Kong. This was after the failure of the Fujian People's Government, when Japanese imperialism was actively invading North China, and the Chiang Kai-shek gang was concentrating all its forces to attack the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, attempting to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese national crisis had reached its most critical juncture. Our meeting adopted the "Provisional Action Program," restored the party organization, responded to the CCP's "August 1st" call, appealed for the establishment of a united anti-Japanese front, advocated war against Japan, and declared a policy of alliance with Russia.
    In 1938, the July 7th Anti-Japanese War broke out, and Ningbo and Shanghai fell successively. The War of Resistance entered its second stage. We convened the Third National Cadre Meeting in Wuhan, which determined the "Political Propositions during the War of Resistance," adhering to unity and achieving democracy as the basic conditions for guaranteeing the victory of the War of Resistance. Due to the establishment of this belief, we were able to overcome the various oppressions imposed on us by the Chiang Kai-shek gang and loyally accepted the leadership of the CCP, participated in the Democratic League, and made our party a strong and struggling member of the democratic front.
    In 1947, we convened the Fourth National Cadre Meeting in Shanghai and formally changed the party name to the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Our main task of struggle was to promote democracy, oppose civil war, unite the masses, to overthrow the reactionary rule and drive out the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China.
    Generally speaking, on the general line of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal Chinese New Democratic Revolution, we have been moving in the direction of progress; we have also fulfilled considerable historical tasks, and finally correctly and resolutely walked under the banner of the working class's correct party, which is in line with the law of the development of the Chinese revolutionary movement. At the same time, based on the revolutionary spirit of courage, we frankly pointed out that in the process of revolutionary work for more than 20 years, we have committed many mistakes. The most serious regret is that in the early days of our party's establishment, because we did not fully accept Marxism-Leninism in our thinking and did not realize the greatness of the leadership of the working class and internationalism, we did not establish a policy of cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party in our revolutionary actions at that time; later, after the lessons of cruel facts, we corrected this wrong direction in the era of the Fujian Incident in 1933.
    Now, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have overthrown the cruel rule of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism, achieved the basic victory of the revolution, convened the People's Political Consultative Conference, promulgated the Common Program, and established their own people's regime, beginning the construction of a New Democratic country. This situation not only makes China leap into an unprecedented new stage in history. At the same time, it is of epoch-making importance for consolidating the cause of world democracy and peace and promoting the rapid demise of the entire world capitalist system.
    Today's world is clearly divided into two strict camps. The reactionary war group headed by US imperialism is vainly attempting to launch a new world war, and the war-mongers are despicably carrying out various international adventures and provocations. However, due to the decay of the world imperialist system, the decline of the reactionary group is becoming increasingly evident. On the contrary, the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, with the success of the Soviet socialist construction and the increasing international prestige, with the consolidation and development of the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe, with the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, with the upsurge of the people's liberation struggles in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and with the unfolding of the struggle of the working people in various imperialist countries for democracy and peace, especially the great victory of the Chinese people, all this points to a truth, that is, on a world scale, the forces of peace and democracy will surely win a historically decisive victory; the old system of British and American imperial capitalism will surely be declared dead; within China, the people's democratic dictatorship will surely win the victory of consolidation and development, and advance to the realization of socialism; all democratic parties will surely, under the correct leadership of the working class party, strive forward, pursue the future of socialism and communism, create conditions, and eliminate the organization.
    Based on the above understanding, our current meeting fully developed the spirit of self-criticism, summarized the experiences and lessons of past struggles, abandoned the incomplete factors remaining in thought and action, developed the revolutionary tradition of adhering to struggle, and grasped the new tasks assigned by the new history. Our party believes that in the future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we should strive to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, strive for the construction of New Democracy, and resolutely struggle to thoroughly realize the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference. Especially when the enemy is dying, we must raise political vigilance and strengthen the consolidation of the people's democratic united front. In order to achieve this task, we must first unite all comrades of the party, accept Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and implement self-transformation; at the same time, we must unite with the broad masses of the people, participate in various economic, cultural, and social transformation and construction undertakings, to fulfill the mission of our party.
    Long live the international democratic and peace front headed by the Soviet Union!
    Strive to build a New Democratic country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party!
    Consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and implement the Common Program!
    Long live the unity, study, progress, and success of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the people's leader Chairman Mao!
    November 26, 1949

### 中国农工民主党　五全干部会议宣言

  　五全干部会议宣言
    【新华社北京八日电】中国农工民主党第五次全国干部会议宣言：
    中国农工民主党第五次全国干部会议，现于一九四九年十一月二十六日在人民的首都宣告圆满地闭幕了！我们全党同志首先要感谢中国共产党暨人民领袖毛主席给与我们贤明的指导。本党召开此次会议的主要任务，是在对于过去奋斗的经验，予以适当的检讨，对于今后全党努力的方向，予以正确的决定。现在我们经过了长期反复的讨论，通过了关于政治与党务的多项决议，我们全党同志今后的工作和行动，将以此为准绳，并力求其贯彻。
    我们认为在今天这样一个伟大的历史阶段，总结本党二十二年来奋斗的经过，是一件必要的而且有意义的工作，我们每一次干部会议都依据每一时期的革命的需要，决定了我们行动的政策。
    一九三○年，第一次全国干部会议在郑演达同志亲自领导下，集会于上海，竖起推翻以蒋匪为首的国民党反动统治的旗帜，确立反帝反封建和土地革命的政治纲领，而创立本党，不幸未二年而郑演达同志遽以身殉。
    一九三五年，我们召开第二次干部会议于香港，这是在福建人民政府失败后，日本帝国主义正积极侵略华北，蒋匪帮反集中全力，进攻工农红军，妄图消灭中国共产党，中国民族危机正到了最严重的关头。我们的会议通过“临时行动纲领”，重新恢复党的组织，响应中共的“八一”号召，呼吁建立抗日联合阵线，主张对日作战，宣布，联俄政策。
    一九三八年，七七抗日战争爆发，宁沪相继沦陷，抗战转入第二期，我们召开第三次全国干部会议于武汉，决定了“抗战时期的政治主张”，以坚持团结，实现民主，为保证抗战必胜的基本条件。由于这一信念的确立，我们终能战胜蒋匪帮所加给我们的种种压迫，而忠诚地接受了中共的领导，参加民主同盟，使本党在民主阵线中成为坚强奋斗的一员。
    一九四七年，我们召开第四次全国干部会议于上海，正式改定为党名为中国农工民主党。我们主要的奋斗任务，是在促进民主，反对内战，团结群众，以推翻反动的统治和驱逐美帝国主义者在中国的侵略势力。
    一般地说来，在反帝反封建的中国新民主主义革命之总路线上，我们是朝着进步的方向前进的；我们也尽了相当的历史任务，而且终于正确地坚决地走到了工人阶级正党的旗帜之下，这正是符合着中国革命运动发展的法则。同时，我们更本着革命的勇敢精神，坦白地指出：在二十余年来革命的工作过程中，我们曾犯着不少的错误，其中感到最严重的遣憾，就是在我党成立初期，由于我们在思想上，没有完全接受马列主义，没有认识到工人阶级的领导和国际主义的伟大，所以在当时革命行动上，没有确立与中国共产党合作的政策；后来经过残酷的事实教训，到了一九三三年福建事变时代，我们才改正了这一个错误的方向。
    现在，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，已经推翻了封建主义、帝国主义和官僚资本主义的残酷统治，取得革命的基本胜利，召开了人民政协，公布了共同纲领，建立起人民自己的政权，开始了新民主主义的国家建设。这种形势，不但使中国跃进到历史上一个空前的新阶段。同时，对于巩固世界民主和平的事业，促进整个世界资本主义迅速灭亡，更具有划时代的重要性。
    今日的世界，很明显地分成两个森严的壁垒，以美帝为首的反动的战争集团，正妄图发动新的世界大战，战争贩子们正在卑鄙地进行着各种国际的冒险和挑衅。可是由于世界帝国主义制度的腐烂，反动集团的日就没落，已无可掩饰。相反的，以苏联为首的和平阵营，有了苏联的社会主义建设成功和国际威信日益增强，有了东欧新民主主义国家的巩固和发展，有了德意志民主共和国的成立，有了殖民地半殖民地国家的人民解放斗争的高涨和各帝国主义国家内劳动人民争取民主和平斗争的展开，尤其是中国人民的伟大胜利，这一切的一切，都指明了一个真理，那就是在世界范围内，和平民主的力量必将获得历史上决定性的胜利；英美帝国资本主义的旧制度必将宣告死亡；在中国范围内，人民民主专政必获得巩固和发展的胜利，而进到社会主义的实现；一切民主党派必将在工人阶级政党的正确领导下，奋力迈进，追向社会主义、共产主义的前途，创造条件，消灭组织。
    本着上述的认识，我们本届会议充分发挥了自我批评精神，总结了历来奋斗的经验与教训，杨弃了思想上行动上残留的不彻底的因素，发展了坚持斗争的革命传统，而把握着新历史所课予的新任务。本党认为今后在中国共产党领导下，应努力于巩固人民民主专政，努力于新民主主义的建设，为彻底实现人民政协共同纲领而坚决奋斗。尤其当敌人垂亡的时候，更要提高政治警觉，加强巩固人民民主统一战线。为了达成这个任务，我们首先要将全党同志团结起来，接受马列主义、毛泽东思想，实行自我改造；同时我们更要和广大人民群众结合起来，参加各种经济的文化的社会的改造和建设事业，以完成本党的使命。
    拥护以苏联为首的国际民主和平阵线！
    在中国共产党领导下为建设新民主主义国家而奋斗！
    巩固人民民主专政，实行共同纲领！
    中国农工民主党团结学习进步成功万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    　　　　　　　　　　一九四九年十一月二十六日
