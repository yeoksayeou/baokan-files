　　The Prairie Fire
　　——How the Movement to Create New Records Was Ignited
　　By Our Correspondent in the Northeast, Tian Liu

　　October holds a special brilliance in the Northeast.

　　Last October, General Lin Biao led the Fourth Field Army to liberate Jinzhou, annihilated the Liao Yaoxiang army group, and ushered in the final liberation of the entire Northeast on November 2nd. This October, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government made a decision, calling on the working class in the Northeast to create new production records to welcome the new high tide of national economic construction. Thus, after undergoing the training of factory protection and takeover, restoration of production, and the anti-waste struggle since July, hundreds of thousands of labor troops, who had become more conscious, advanced bravely just like their own People's Liberation Army last year. From the sunny South Manchurian Plain to the snowy North Manchurian forests, from the eastern coast caressed by gentle breezes to the Inner Mongolian grasslands where cattle and sheep gallop, the prairie fire of creating new records burned everywhere.

　　　　Two Sparks Emerge

　　Just like mass movements in political revolution, one or two sparks can ignite a prairie fire. The movement to create new production records by hundreds of thousands of workers in the Northeast was ignited by the two sparks of Zhang Shangju and Zhao Guoyou from the No. 3 Machine Factory in Shenyang.

　　This July, when people heard that the No. 4 Machine Factory could turn a "pulley" in only four hours, no one believed it. Zhang Shangju, Zhao Guoyou, and other workers from the No. 3 Factory went to the No. 4 Factory to visit with the attitude of "seeing if they were bragging." As a result, it was true, it only took four hours. "What to do?" Communist Party member Zhang Shangju thought to himself, and Youth League member Zhao Guoyou also thought: "We are also lathe operators, they can do two, but we can only do one!" One day, the two met, and Zhang Shangju spoke first: "What to do?" Zhao Guoyou replied: "Whatever you say." "If you can make one in four hours, I guarantee that my layout time will also be reduced to four hours." So the two started competing. Zhao Guoyou worked desperately, and the time to turn a "pulley" was quickly reduced from seven hours, six hours, to five and a half hours, but after being reduced to five hours, it could not be reduced any further. Zhang Shangju's layout time was reduced to two and a half hours, and he mobilized all seven people in the group. The layout time for the entire six-foot lathe had been reduced from 178 hours to 41 hours. At this time, Zhao Guoyou was anxious, but he couldn't produce. Trying harder, the tools were not up to par. The milling cutter bar was like suffering from malaria, shaking constantly, and bouncing back as soon as it cut. The lathe tool was like a silkworm eating mulberry leaves, nibbling away bit by bit. That day, it happened to be a meeting of the Youth League, and the leaders called for "invention and creation, tool modification, so that work can be done faster!" This reminded Zhao Guoyou. After several days of research, he thickened the milling cutter bar and increased the size of the lathe tool. On August 4th, he created a new record of two hours and twenty minutes, breaking the "highest standard" of four hours under the puppet Manchurian regime. Zhang Shangju's layout team was not weak either, and the entire six-foot lathe layout was reduced to 21 hours. The new records of Zhang and Zhao spread like thunder in spring, and immediately spread throughout the factory. Thousands of workers surrounded them, cheering, applauding, and congratulating. There were also a few backward workers who began to be jealous of them, and some even ridiculed them: "Old Zhao, work hard, you can enjoy labor insurance (referring to labor insurance) if you work yourself to death." Some people even ran to his wife to provoke: "Quickly persuade him, the workers all hate him, and besides, you won't feel bad if he works like this and ruins his health?" How discouraging! During the day, he was ridiculed by backward elements in the factory, and at night, his wife wouldn't give him a good look. At first, Lao Zhao patiently explained, but his wife either nagged and entangled endlessly, or pouted and ignored him. Lao Zhao got anxious and went to sleep on the side, getting angry. Thinking about it, he remembered the things of the past: his father herded pigs for the landlord when he was nine years old, and he himself entered the puppet "Manchurian Work Office" as an apprentice at the age of fifteen. He tasted all kinds of hardships for ten years, unable to eat enough, unable to wear enough, and sleeping on the roof every night hungry to prevent being caught for conscription. "People must have a conscience. What kind of life was that, and what kind of life is it now?" In the end, Zhao Guoyou thought to himself: "The Party and the League have educated and cultivated me like this, if I don't give my heart to work, who can I be worthy of?" So the next morning, as usual, when the whistle blew, Zhao Guoyou was already turning his pulley.

　　　　Encouragement from All Directions

　　Zhao Guoyou did not slacken his efforts because of the slander of individual backward elements. He believed that the workers had suffered like him, and those who were backward today would wake up tomorrow. He cared more about them and helped them transform their tools and create new records. At the same time, there was more encouragement and support from all directions than slander. The Party, government, and trade union combined to educate backward elements. The Youth League headquarters encouraged him: "Work hard and set an example for the workers." Lao Zhao worked even harder and created a new record of two hours and ten minutes. The factory put him on the honor roll, selected him as a meritorious worker, and awarded him a bonus. This news shocked the entire factory and summoned every worker. "Creating new records" quickly became the actual action of every worker. New records appeared every day. Worker Dang Hui'an reduced the time to turn the "lead screw" from 30 hours to 2 hours and 37 minutes. Kang Motian's time to turn the "smooth screw" was more than seven times shorter than before. Zhang Guoshi, who had ridiculed Lao Zhao, also worked without rest even with swollen feet, secretly working hard to catch up with Zhao Guoyou. Lao Zhao was not satisfied and strived for perfection. As his skills became more and more proficient, he adopted a combined turning and milling operation method, and created a new record of one hour and sixteen minutes on September 14. Zhang Shangju's layout team created a record of eleven hours and thirty minutes. The newspapers published their news in large characters, the film crew made a film about them, and the Ministry of Industry gave them many bonuses and used them as examples to make a decision, calling on all workers to learn from them and all mines and factories to launch a new record movement.

　　　　Spread Throughout the Northeast

　　This news, like the news last year that the Liberation Army captured Liao Yaoxiang alive and liberated Jinzhou, spread throughout the Northeast like a gust of wind. The workers of the Motor Vehicle Plant and the Parts Factory said: "We and Zhao Guoyou were classmates and apprentices together. If they can do it, why can't we?" Worker Meng Qingyuan made up his mind and quickly increased the number of "oil rings" he turned each day from 110 to 192. Li Chunhua increased the number of "pistons" he cut from 75 to 110. By October 10, the factory had 19 kinds of parts that were three times more efficient than under the puppet Manchurian regime. From Anshan, Benxi, Fushun, and from more distant factories and mines, letters signed with the names of many workers were constantly sent to Shenyang, to Zhao Guoyou, some congratulating him, some asking him to introduce his experience, and all wanting to "learn from Zhang Shangju" and "catch up with Zhao Guoyou."

　　Wherever the news spread, it stirred up a frenzy of creating new records. By late October, it had formed a vigorous mass movement of creating new records involving hundreds of thousands of labor troops. From factories to mines, from heavy industry to light industry, from railways to trade departments, the prairie fire of creating new records burned everywhere.

　　燎原的火焰
    ——创新纪录运动烈火是怎样点燃起来的
    本报驻东北记者  田流
    十月，在东北有着特殊的光辉。
    去年十月，林彪将军率领的第四野战军解放了锦州，全歼廖耀湘兵团，迎接了十一月二日的全东北最后解放。今年十月，中共中央东北局、东北人民政府工业部作了决定，号召东北工人阶级创造生产新纪录，迎接全国经济建设的新高潮。于是经过了护厂接收、恢复生产，以及七月以后反浪费斗争的锻炼而更加觉悟了的数十万劳动大军，又象去年自己的解放军一样奋勇前进了。从阳光充沛的南满平原上到白雪皑皑的北满森林里，从柔风吹拂着的东部海岸到牛羊奔驰的内蒙草原，到处燃烧起创造新纪录的燎原烈火。
    　　　　迸出两个火花
    生产革命的群众运动象政治革命的群众运动一样，一两个火花便可燃起燎原的大火，东北数十万工人的创造生产新纪录运动，就是沈阳第三机器厂张尚举、赵国有这两个火花点燃起来的。
    今年七月，人们听说第四机器厂车一个“塔轮”只要四个钟点，谁也不信。张尚举赵国有和三厂别的工友抱着“看他们是不是吹牛”的心情去四厂参观，结果一点不错，就是四个钟点。“咋整呢？”共产党员张尚举心里想，青年团员赵国有心里也想：“咱也是个车工，人家作两个咱只能作一个！”一天两人碰了面，张尚举先开口：“咋整呢？”赵国有回答道：“你说咋整就咋整。”“你要能四点钟作一个，我的车头划线也保证缩到四点钟。”两个人就比赛起来了。赵国有拼命的干，车一个“塔轮”的时间由七个钟点、六个钟点、五个半钟点的迅速缩短起来，但缩到五个钟点后再也缩不下去了。张尚举的划线缩到两个半钟点，他再把全组七个人都动员起来，整个六英尺车床划线，已经由一七八小时缩到四一小时了。这时赵国有干着急，就是干不出活来。再加一把劲吧，工具不争气，铣刀杆子就象打摆子（疟疾），一个劲的抖，吃上刀就挡回来啦，车刀又象蚕吃桑叶，一点一点的啃。那天碰巧团里开会，领导上号召“发明创造、改造工具，活才能干的快！”这一下提醒了赵国有，经过好几天的研究，他把铣刀杆子加粗，又把车刀增大。八月四日一下子创造了两点二十分的纪录，冲破伪满四小时的“最高标准”，张尚举划线小组也不弱，全部六英尺车床划线又缩到二十一小时。张、赵二人的新纪录象春天响了一声雷，全厂立时都传遍了，上千的工友围着他们欢呼、鼓掌、庆贺。也有少数落后工人开始嫉妒他们，还有人讽刺他们：“老赵使劲干吧，累死了能享受劳保（指劳动保险）。”甚至有人跑到他老婆那里挑拨：“快劝劝他吧，工人们都恨他，再说这样没死没活的干，身子累坏了你不心痛？”多败兴，白天在厂子里受了落后分子饥讽，晚上老婆还不给好模样儿看。起初，老赵还耐着性儿解释，可是老婆不是唠唠叨叨纠缠不清，就是咕嘟着小嘴不答理。老赵一急，就睡在一边生起气来。左思右想，就想起当年的事来了：他父亲九岁上就给地主放猪，自己十五岁入伪“满州工作所”当学徒，整整十年，啥苦都尝到了，吃不上，穿不上，夜夜饿着肚子睡在房顶上防备抓兵。“人得有良心，那时啥生活，如今啥生活？”赵国有想到最后，心里说：“党和团又这样教育培养我，不掏出心来干，能对住谁呢？”于是第二天早晨照样，当汽笛响的时候，赵国有已经在车他的塔轮了。
    　　　　四面八方的鼓励
    赵国有没有因个别落后分子的诋毁而松懈自己的努力，他相信工友们都和自己一样受过苦，今天落后的，明天就会醒悟过来。他更多的关心他们，帮助他们改造工具，创造新纪录。同时比诋毁更多的，是从四面八方来的鼓励和支持，党、政、工会结合起来对落后分子进行教育。青年团团部鼓励他说：“好好干下去，给工友们做出榜样来。”老赵干的更起劲，又创造了二点十分的新纪录，厂里给他上了光荣榜，选他当功臣，发给他奖金。这消息震撼着全厂，召唤着每个工人，“创新纪录”很快就变成每个工友的实际行动了。新纪录天天出现，工友党会安车“丝杠”由三十小时减少到二时三十七分，康墨田车“光杠”比过去缩短工时七倍多，讽刺过老赵的张国士也变得肿着脚都不歇工，暗暗加劲追赶赵国有了。老赵没有满足，精益求精，随着技术一天天熟练，又采用车铣结合操作法，于九月十四日创一点十六分的新纪录，张尚举划线组创造了十一小时三十分的最高纪录。报上把他们的消息用大字登出来，电影队给他们拍成电影，工业部又给了他们很多奖金，还以他们为榜样，作出决定，号召全体工人向他们学习，一切矿厂都要开展新纪录运动。
    　　　传遍了全东北
    这消息象去年解放大军活捉廖耀湘，解放锦州城的捷报一样，一阵风传遍了全东北。汽车总厂机件厂工友们说：“咱和赵国有一块同过师学过徒，他们能干咱就不能？”工友孟庆员一下决心，每天由车一一○个“油圈”很快提到一九二个，李春华切“活赛”由七五个提到一一○个，到十月十日该厂就有十九种零件比伪满生产效能提高了三倍。从鞍山、本溪、抚顺，从更远的工厂矿山里，签着好多工人名子的信，不断地寄往沈阳，寄给赵国有，有的向他祝贺，有的请他介绍经验，都要“学习张尚举”，“追赶赵国有”。
    消息传到那里，那里便掀起创造新纪录的狂涛，到十月下旬就形成有数十万劳动大军参加的、轰轰烈烈的创造新纪录的群众运动了。从工厂到矿山、从重工业到轻工业，从铁路到贸易部门，到处燃烧起创造新纪录的燎原大火。
