　　Focusing on the Increase Production and Thrift Campaign
  　Overcoming Closed-Doorism in League Building
  　Expanding the Number of Jining Factory Members
    [Shandong News] Jining Factory's work on building the League has gradually developed after initially overcoming closed-doorism. In just over a month, 114 new members were developed. Adding these to the 80 members developed in the first half of the year, they account for 25.4% of all young workers, and twelve branches have been established. The emergence of closed-doorism was due to the lack of clarity in the League Work Committee's guiding ideology regarding the purpose of building the League, which led to the League being confined to a small circle. To overcome closed-doorism, the Work Committee first concentrated on organizing youth League cadres from the city in mid-October to study Comrade Feng Wenbin's report at the East China Bureau's Youth Work Conference, criticized closed-doorism, and proposed concrete solutions. Cadres went to the branches and among the young workers to educate them on the "purpose of building the League," "how the League should connect with the masses," and "why to develop members," guiding the examination of closed-doorism within the branches. At the same time, focusing on the current tasks of the Party and the Trade Union, they formulated specific plans to overcome closed-doorism in the future. For example, the League branch of the soy sauce factory, based on the situation at the time when the labor-management sides in the soy sauce industry requested the signing of a collective contract, arranged for League members to convene meetings among young workers to generally promote the collective contract as a contract that specifically stipulates the rights and obligations of both labor and management within a certain period. They required all League members to unite with young workers to actively participate in discussions, and the branch established a reporting system, with League member groups reporting once a day and the branch reporting to the Work Committee every other day, focusing on reporting the ideological situation of both labor and management regarding the signing of collective activities. Simultaneously, in conjunction with carrying out education on building the League, they taught a League lesson, and the workers felt that "the strength of the League is greater, and the task can definitely be completed well and quickly." Activists in this movement actively requested to join the League, and fifteen members were officially developed. At the same time, within the League, with the branch as the unit, a semi-annual five-evaluation (evaluate progress, evaluate achievements, evaluate strengths, evaluate weaknesses, evaluate League building cadres) movement was conducted, with all non-League young workers and invited Trade Union directors and technicians participating. In the five evaluations, various model deeds were evaluated, breaking the one-sided idea of some cadres who, after the League made closed-doorist deviations, would obliterate the League's other achievements. Wei Yong'an, the secretary of the iron industry League branch, and twenty-one others accepted the opinions of the masses in the evaluation and admitted twenty-six young people who had not been admitted into the League in the past due to closed-doorism, reorganized two branches, clarified the fifty-four education objects who already had the qualifications to join the League, and at the same time made League members realize their own shortcomings, thus improving their understanding of the League. Subsequently, on the basis of the five evaluations, closely combining the general tasks proposed by the Party and the Trade Union, the League was built from the labor movement, and the League was arranged to actively participate in the increase production and thrift campaign and the establishment of merit and model movement in the factory. The Work Committee also focused on the state-owned flour factory, the private match factory, and the iron industry as three key areas to draw on experience to promote the general. The ideological foundation of the meritorious service movement has also been generally laid within the League. However, due to the short time and lack of attention to in-depth ideological education, formalism and recruitment for the sake of numbers exist in some places.

　　围绕增产节约竞赛
  　克服建团关门主义
  　济宁工厂团员数量扩增
    【山东讯】济宁工厂建团工作经初步克服关门主义后逐渐开展，月余中发展团员一百十四个，连前半年发展的八十个共占全体青工的百分之二十五．四，建立了十二个支部。关门主义的产生，是由于团工委领导思想上对建团的目的性不明确，以致使团限制在小圈子内。为克服关门主义，工委首先在十月中旬集中全市青年团干部学习冯文彬同志在华东局青年工作会议上的报告，批判了关门主义，提出了克服的具体办法，各干部分别至各支部全体团员与青工中进行“建团目的”、“团如何联系群众”、“为什么发展团员”的教育，引导检查支部的关门主义的表现，同时围绕着党和工会当前的任务，制定今后克服关门主义的具体计划。例如：酱园业团支部根据当时酱园业劳资双方要求订立集体合同的情况，即布置团员在青工中召集会议，普遍宣传集体合同是劳资双方在一定期内具体规定双方权利和义务的一种契约书，要求全体团员团结青工积极参加讨论，支部并订定了汇报制度，团员小组一天汇报一次，支部隔日向工委汇报一次，着重汇报劳资双方对订立集体活动的思想情况。同时结合进行建团教育，上了一次团课，工人们都觉得“团的力量大了，任务保险能完成得又好又快”。在这运动中的积极分子纷纷要求入团，并正式发展了十五个团员，同时在团内以支部为单位，进行入团半年的五评（评进步、评成绩、评优点、评缺点、评建团干部）运动，由全体非团青工及聘请工会主任和技师参加。在五评中评出了各种模范事实，打破了个别干部在团犯了关门主义偏向后抹煞团的其他成绩的片面想法。铁业团支书记魏永安等二十二名在评议中接受群众意见，将过去由于关门主义而未入团的青年二十六个吸收入团，改选支部两个，明确了已具有入团条件的五十四个教育对象，同时使团员认识了自己的缺点，使之对团的认识提高了一步。接着在五评的基础上密切结合党和工会提出的总任务，从工运中建团，布置团积极参加工厂中开展的增产节约立功竞赛创模运动。工委并以公营面粉厂、私营火柴厂、铁工业等三处为重点，以吸取经验推动一般。团内亦已普遍打下了立功运动的思想基础。但由于时间短促及不注意深入的思想教育工作，个别地方存在着形式主义和拉夫现象。
