A Visit with the Korean Women's Delegation
    Chen Ji

    The Korean Women's Delegation, representing democratic women from all walks of life in both North and South Korea, came to Beijing to participate in the Asian Women's Representative Conference, fighting heroically for a common goal under two drastically different social systems. They include Park Jung-ae, a beloved leader of Korean women who endured 15 years of arduous underground work in the Japanese-occupied territories, was arrested multiple times, and subjected to medieval torture without ever yielding; Liu Ying-jun, Chairperson of the South Korean Democratic Women's League, who has waged an unyielding struggle against imperialism for over forty years; Heo Jeong-suk, Minister of Culture and Propaganda of the Korean People's Republic Cabinet; Heo Cheol, an eighteen-year-old female guerrilla fighter who participated in twelve battles; Kim Soo-ja, an outstanding model female worker from North Korea; Kim Soon, an excellent model farmer; and Choi Seung-hee, a famous oriental dancer. They spent long and painful years under the brutal rule of Japanese imperialism. Four years ago, in the northern part of their homeland, thanks to the great Soviet Red Army defeating Japanese imperialism and helping them to rebuild, they gained unprecedented democratic rights and embarked on a happy and free life. In the southern part of their homeland, the American imperialists, contrary to the will of the Korean people and all progressive humanity, tore up the December 1945 Moscow Conference of Soviet, British, and American Foreign Ministers' decision on the Korean issue. They used the votes of countries in the United Nations dependent on American "economic aid" to establish the "United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea," presided over by American imperialism and Korean traitors, attempting to divide Korea's unity in order to further exploit the Korean people and Korean women. South Korean women have been thrown back into a life of misery and suffering.

    The Korean people and Korean women will never succumb to the violence of the imperialists. In 1948, the people of Jeju Island first ignited the flames of armed resistance. For a year, the people's armed forces in South Korea have flourished. In the short span of three months from April to July this year, guerrilla activities have unfolded in seven out of eight provinces, one hundred and seventeen counties, and six hundred and eighty-two districts in South Korea. Heo Cheol, a female combat hero from South Korea, firmly stated: "We will not stop fighting until we eliminate the enemy. Our struggle has the support of the broad masses of the people, and we will surely achieve complete victory." This young female guerrilla fighter, only eighteen years old, like thousands of other South Korean women, was unable to complete elementary school due to poverty. She represents the spirit of resistance of thousands upon thousands of oppressed South Korean women demanding liberation, and she resolutely joined the guerrilla forces for the sake of the unification and prosperity of her motherland. She knows that their beautiful future prospects have been severed by American imperialism and its lackey, Syngman Rhee. She knows that only by driving out the imperialists can they gain liberation. Like all the women heroes fighting for their country and people, she fears no hardship in the rugged mountains of South Korea, amidst the enemy's gunfire, and fights the enemy with weapons seized from them. When she sees the enemy she personally killed fall dead, she excitedly shouts that they will achieve more victories. When she heard the news that her parents and three young siblings were brutally murdered by the enemy, she vowed to fight the enemy even more bravely. She deeply understands that only when the South Korean people completely defeat the enemy can her deceased relatives rest in peace.

    The liberated North Korean women will never forget their suffering South Korean sisters. Under the leadership of the Korean people's great leader, General Kim Il-sung, they are fighting for the prosperity and unification of their homeland. Female workers are launching great production efforts with selfless enthusiasm, the number of female labor heroes is increasing daily, production quality is constantly improving, and new creations and inventions are being advocated everywhere. In the past two years alone, industrial output has increased 2.6 times compared to before liberation, and the output of silk fabrics has almost increased fivefold. When model worker Kim Soo-ja appeared before us, we heard Minister of Culture and Propaganda Heo Jeong-suk introduce her to us: "She is a female worker at the state-owned textile factory. She is the most skilled at setting production records. She is an outstanding daughter of our country." She said that in the factories, railways, and mines of North Korea, model workers like Kim Soo-ja are everywhere. Female workers account for 40% of all labor model workers in North Korea. Women in North Korean rural areas also have their own land, and they are fully utilizing their labor force. In the past two years, the sown area has increased by 21.8%, and grain yields have also increased compared to previous years. At this time, Kim Soon, a forty-three-year-old model farmer, nodded repeatedly with joy at Heo Jeong-suk's remarks. We heard the fact that North Korean farm children can also go to school, and we learned that North Korea will complete the elimination of illiteracy by the end of this year. When we saw the performances of the cultural troupe composed of the Choi Seung-hee Dance Research Institute, the Korean National Art Theater, and the National College of Music, we knew the new achievements in the development of culture and art in North Korea. The women of North Korea are working hard to build their homeland in this way. A vast and brilliant prospect has begun to unfold before the women of North Korea, and a new and bright path has been pointed out before all the Korean people. In order to walk towards this bright path, some are shedding blood, some are sweating, and they will definitely achieve their common goal.

    Now, they are enthusiastically participating in the Asian Women's Representative Conference. They know that their struggle is inseparable from the struggle of all Asian women and is combined with the struggle of women all over the world. The women of all Korea have great expectations for this conference. Like women representatives from other countries, they firmly believe that this Asian Women's Representative Conference is of extreme importance for overthrowing imperialism and its lackeys in Asia and for striving for Korean independence, people's democracy, and lasting world peace.

　　朝鲜妇女代表团访问记
    陈迹
    在两种截然不同的社会制度里，为着共同的目标而进行英勇斗争的朝鲜妇女代表团，代表着南北朝鲜各阶层的民主妇女来到北京参加亚洲妇女代表会议。她们——有曾经在日本占领区做过十五年艰苦的地下工作，多次被捕，受过中世纪式的酷刑而从不屈服为朝鲜妇女爱戴的领袖朴正爱；有四十多年来一直和帝国主义作不屈不挠的斗争的南朝鲜民主妇女同盟委员长刘英俊；有朝鲜人民共和国内阁文化宣传部长许贞淑；有参加过十二次战斗的十八岁的女游击队员许铁；有北朝鲜出色的模范女工金秀子；有优秀的模范农妇金淳；有著名东方的舞蹈家崔承喜。她们曾经在日本帝国主义的残暴统治下渡过悠长惨痛的岁月；四年以前，在她们祖国的北部，由于伟大的苏联红军击溃了日本帝国主义，帮助她们恢复进行了建设，她们获得了从来未有的民主权利，走上了幸福自由的生活。在她们祖国的南部，美帝国主义者违背朝鲜和全世界进步人类的意志，撕毁了一九四五年十二月莫斯科苏、英、美三国外长会议对朝鲜问题的决定，利用联合国中倚赖美国“经济援助”国家的票数，成立以美帝及朝鲜卖国贼所主持的“联合国临时朝鲜委员会”，企图分裂朝鲜的统一，以便进一步压榨朝鲜人民和朝鲜妇女。南朝鲜妇女又被投入水深火热的凄惨生活中。
    朝鲜人民和朝鲜妇女决不会屈服于帝国主义者的暴力之下。一九四八年济舟岛人民首先燃起武装抗争之火，一年以来，南朝鲜的人民武装已蓬勃发展起来了。今年四月到七月的短短三个月里，南朝鲜八个府中，已有七个府、一百一十七个郡，六百八十二个区展开了游击活动。南朝鲜女战斗英雄许铁坚定地说：“我们不消灭敌人，我们决不停止战斗；我们的战斗有着广大人民的支持，我们一定能得到彻底的胜利。”这位才十八岁的年青的女游击队员，和其他千万个南朝鲜妇女一样，因贫穷而不能读完小学。她代表着千千万万被压迫的南朝鲜妇女要求解放的反抗精神，为了祖国的统一和富强，毅然地参加了游击队。她知道她们未来的美好远景，已经被美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚砍断了，她知道只有把帝国主义者赶出去，她们才能获得解放。她如同所有为祖国人民而奋斗的妇女英雄们一样，在南朝鲜崎岖的山林里，在敌人的枪林弹雨里，不怕艰苦地以缴自敌人的武器和敌人作战。当她看见了她亲手杀死的敌人倒毙下去时，她兴奋地高呼我们还要取得更多的胜利。当她听到她的父母和三个年幼的弟弟被敌人惨杀的消息，她宣誓她将更英勇地和敌人作战，她深深明白只有南朝鲜人民完全战胜了敌人，她的死去的亲人才能瞑目。
    解放了的北朝鲜妇女们，她们永远不会忘记苦难中的南朝鲜姊妹，她们在朝鲜人民伟大的领袖金日成将军的领导下，为着她们祖国的富强和统一而斗争。女工们，正在以忘我的热情展开伟大的生产工作，女劳动英雄逐日增多，生产质量不断提高，新的创造和发明到处在倡导。单在过去两年中，工业产量就增加到解放以前二点六倍，丝织品的产量几乎增加到五倍。当模范工人金秀子出现在我们面前时，我们听到了文化宣传部长许贞淑给我们的介绍：“她是国营纺织工厂的女工，她是生产纪录最高的能手，她是我们国家的优秀儿女。”她说：在北朝鲜的工厂、铁路和矿山里，象金秀子这样的模范工人处处皆是。全北朝鲜的劳模工人中，女工要占到百分之四十。北朝鲜农村里的妇女们，也都有了自己的土地，她们正充分发挥她们的劳动力。过去两年中，播种的面积增加了百分之廿一点八，谷物收成也比往年提高了。这时候，四十三岁的模范农妇金淳带着愉快的心情，对于许贞淑的谈话，一再点头表示欢欣。我们听到北朝鲜的农家孩子也都能上学的事实，我们知道了在今年年底北朝鲜将要全部完成扫除文盲的工作。我们看到崔承喜舞踊研究所和朝鲜国立艺术剧院，国立音乐大学组成的文工团的演出时，我们知道北朝鲜文化艺术发展的新的成就。北朝鲜的妇女们，就是这样努力地建设着她们的祖国。在北朝鲜妇女面前已开始展开一幅广阔的烂灿的远景，在全朝鲜人民面前已指出了一条新的光明大道，为要走向这个光明大道，她们有的在流血，有的在流汗，她们一定会达到共同的目的。
    现在，她们热烈地来参加亚洲妇女代表会议，她们知道她们的斗争是和全亚洲妇女的斗争是分不开的，是和全世界妇女的斗争结合在一起的。全朝鲜妇女对于这次会议期望很大，她们和其他国家的妇女代表一样地坚信这个亚洲妇女代表会议对于打倒在亚洲的帝国主义及其走狗们以及争取朝鲜独立人民民主和世界持久和平有着极重大意义的。
