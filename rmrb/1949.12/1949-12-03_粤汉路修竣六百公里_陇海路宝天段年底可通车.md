　　Yuehan Railway Repairs Complete for 600 Kilometers
　　Longhai Railway Baotian Section to be Open to Traffic by Year's End
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Employees of the Hengyang Railway Bureau and the 2nd Detachment of the Railway Corps are intensifying their efforts to repair the Yuehan Line. As of now, a total of over 620 kilometers have been fully repaired in four sections: Wuchang to Gantian, Hengyang to Leiyang, Chen County to Zhengjiatang, and Guangzhou North to Pajiangkou. The remaining sections are also mostly restored. Currently, the focus of the Yuehan Line repair project is on bridge construction. South of Hengshan, seventeen bridges have been damaged, with a total length of 1932.76 meters. Among them, the Qujiang, Pajiang, and Zhanghe bridges are 30 to 39 meters high, making the project very arduous.
　　Employees of the Hengyang Bureau and soldiers of the Railway Corps have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm, working in the rain to repair the line, allowing the Wuchang-Zhuzhou section to open to traffic eight days ahead of schedule, and extending the repaired section to Gantian, repairing 30 kilometers of track ahead of schedule.
　　[Another report] More than 4,000 railway employees are actively engaged in the repair of the Baoji-Tianshui section of the Longhai Railway within Shaanxi Province, and it is expected that the entire line can be repaired and open to traffic before the end of the year. In order to strengthen road maintenance and ensure traffic safety, the Xi'an Railway Branch Bureau is not only allocating 8,000 railway sleepers to the project site to replace decayed sleepers but also dispatched 75 engineering technicians on November 1st, divided into five groups to measure the new lines, to improve curves with a radius of around 150 meters to over 300 meters where possible, expand the angle of the curves, and make the arcs smoother to increase load capacity and driving speed.
　　[Another report] While repairing the Tongguan-Luoyang section of the Longhai Railway and simultaneously repairing the Tianshui-Baoji section, the Xi'an Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has now dispatched more than 20 engineering technicians to re-survey along the Tianshui-Lanzhou section. It is expected that the project will begin next spring.

　　粤汉路修竣六百公里
  　陇海路宝天段年底可通车
    【本报讯】衡阳铁路局职工和铁道兵团第二支队，正在加紧的抢修粤汉线。到目前为止，武昌到淦田，衡阳到耒阳，郴县到郑家塘，广州北到琶江口等四段共六百二十多公里已经完全修好，其余各段线路，也大部修复。现在粤汉线抢修工程，重点放在桥工方面，衡山以南，有十七座桥梁被破坏，总延长一九三二点七六公尺，其中曲江，琶江，樟河三桥，高度达三十到三十九公尺，工程非常艰巨。
    衡阳局员工和铁道兵团战士，发挥了高度的劳动热情，冒雨抢修，使武昌株州间提前八天通车，而抢修区间还延长到淦田，提前修复了三十公里的线路。
    【又讯】陇海铁路陕西境内之宝（鸡）天（水）段，四千余铁路员工正展开积极抢修，预计全线年底前可以修复通车。西安铁路分局为了加强养路、保证行车安全起见，除正在拨送八千根枕木至工程地点，以便抽换已经朽腐的枕木外，又于十一月一日派出七十五名工程技术人员，分五个小组测量新线路，其目的为使半径在一百五十公尺左右之弯道，设法改善至三百公尺以上，以扩展弯道角度，使弧线平顺，借以增加载重量和驶行速度。
    【又讯】陇海铁路在修复潼（关）洛（阳）段之后，与抢修天（水）宝（鸡）段同时，郑州铁路局西安分局现已派出二十余名工程技术人员去天（水）兰（州）段沿线复测。预计该段工程将于明春开始。
