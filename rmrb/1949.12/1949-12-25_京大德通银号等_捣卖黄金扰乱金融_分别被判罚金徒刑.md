Beijing News: The Beijing People's Court has ruled on the cases of Dadetong Bank, Jianmin Department Store, Gongjuxing Cigarette Shop, Xingshenghe Cotton and Cloth Shop, and others for smuggling and selling gold and disrupting finance. After the Beijing Military Control Commission announced the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Gold and Silver," Dadetong Bank continued to buy and sell gold frequently, acting as a public gold trading place, seriously harming the interests of the people. On a certain day in July, the bank bought 35 taels of gold from Jianmin Department Store. Jianmin Department Store was found to have bought 25 taels of gold from Gongjuxing Cigarette Shop and 10 taels from Xingshenghe Cloth Shop in the previous few days, all of which were sold to Dadetong. Now, the Beijing People's Court has sentenced Dadetong Bank to a fine of 5 million yuan, Deputy Manager Yan Xiaoquan to three years in prison, and Manager Duan Ruiming and Business Director Zhang Yuanchuan each to two years and six months in prison, according to Articles 9, Sections 2 and 3 of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Gold and Silver." Jianmin Department Store was fined 2 million yuan, and Manager Tian Fangdian was sentenced to one year in prison with a two-year reprieve. Gongjuxing Cigarette Shop was fined 1.5 million yuan, and Xingshenghe Cotton and Cloth Shop was fined 1 million yuan. The managers of these two shops, Fang Delin and Zhang Zhenya, were released after education by the court.
