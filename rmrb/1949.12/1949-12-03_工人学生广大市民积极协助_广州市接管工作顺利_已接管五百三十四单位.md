Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 2nd:

　　Guangzhou's takeover work has come to a close. Since October 23rd, the administrative departments have taken over a total of 137 units in the pseudo-provincial and municipal government systems; the financial departments have taken over a total of 78 units including banks, factories, warehouses, and the "Guangdong Industrial Company" system; the transportation and telecommunications departments have taken over 83 units including radio stations, warehouses, and factories; the military departments have taken over 87 units including hospitals, warehouses, and factories; the cultural and educational departments have taken over 8 public colleges and universities, 11 public secondary vocational schools, 93 primary schools, and 20 units including newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, bookstores, printing plants, libraries, cultural centers, and theaters. Together with other pseudo-social organizations, the various departments have taken over a total of 534 units; and received a total of 34,310 old personnel from various levels of organs and groups.

　　After the takeover, the public-owned factories are actively restoring production. Among the more than 40 public-owned enterprises, except for paper mills and clothing factories that could not be immediately put into operation due to prolonged shutdowns and severe damage in the past, the remaining water, electricity, steel, cement, oil refining, and sugar refining factories have all or partially resumed production. In terms of transportation: steamers sail daily to the four rural districts and major cities in the East, West, and North Rivers, with a voyage of more than 1,900 kilometers, which greatly helps the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In terms of railways: the Guangzhou-Qujiang section has already been opened to traffic. Postal delivery and radio communication between Guangzhou and domestic and foreign countries have been restored. Highways between Guangzhou and various counties and the provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi have also been largely opened to traffic. In terms of schools: Sun Yat-sen University, which moved to the urban area before liberation, has now moved back to its original site in Shipai and is scheduled to resume classes in mid-December; other schools have resumed classes one after another. Except for a few secret agents and those who are corrupt, degenerate, and notoriously bad, most of the personnel of various organs are still retained for continued employment, or participate in training classes in batches for learning and transformation.

　　Because the People's Liberation Army entered the city quickly, the enemy's planned destruction was not realized. Therefore, except for the Haizhu Iron Bridge, the warehouse of the Shijing Arsenal, and the Tianhe Machine Factory which were destroyed, most of the equipment and materials of other public utilities and public-owned enterprises were preserved. In addition, the various takeover units implemented the correct urban policies and received the assistance of workers, students, and the general public, which enabled them to quickly overcome the sabotage of bandits and secret agents and the difficulty of the taken-over units concealing and transforming property in the initial stage of the takeover, so that the entire takeover work came to a successful conclusion.

　　工人学生广大市民积极协助
  　广州市接管工作顺利
    已接管五百三十四单位
    【新华社广州二日电】广州市的接管工作已告一段落。自十月二十三日以来，行政部门接管了伪省市政府系统共一百三十七个单位，财经部门接管了银行、工厂、仓库和“广东实业公司”系统等共七十八个单位；交通电讯部门按管电台、仓库、工厂等八十三个单位；军事部门接管医院、仓库、工厂等八十七个单位；文教部门接管公立专科以上院校八所，公立中职学校十一所，小学九十三所，报馆、通讯社、广播电台、书店、印刷厂、图书馆、文化馆、戏院等共二十个单位。连同其他伪社会团体，各部门已接管的一共有五百三十四个单位；并接收了各种机关团体的各级旧人员共三万四千三百一十人。
    接管后，各公营工厂积极进行恢复生产。在公营企业四十余工厂中，除造纸、被服等厂因过去停工过久，损坏过重未能即时开工外，其余水、电、制钢、士敏土、炼油、制糖等厂均全部或局部恢复生产。交通方面：每日有汽船航行于四乡及东、西、北三江各重要城市，航程一千九百余公里，对城乡物资交流，帮助颇大。铁路方面：广州曲江段业已通车。广州与国内外的邮递和有无线电交通业已恢复。广州与各县和湘赣两省间公路亦已大部通车。学校方面：在解放前迁入市区的中山大学，现已迁回石牌原址，定于本月中旬复课；其他学校均已先后复课。各机关人员除少数特务分子及贪污腐化、劣迹昭著外，大部仍予继续留用，或分批参加训练班进行学习和改造。
    由于人民解放军入城迅速，使敌人预定的一切破坏计划未及实现，因此除了海珠大铁桥、石井兵工厂仓库、天河机厂被破坏外，其他各公用事业和公营企业的设备和物资，大部均保存下来。加以各接管单位贯彻执行了正确的城市政策，获得工人、学生及广大市民的协助，因此得以迅速克服了接管初期土匪特务的捣乱和被接管单位隐蔽转化财产的困难，使整个接管工作顺利告一段落。
