　　The Soviet Union Has Implemented Universal Education
　　There are Now Over 220,000 Schools and Over 33.3 Million Students
　　The Soviet government has implemented universal juvenile education taught in the languages of the various Soviet nationalities. There are now over 220,000 schools and 33.3 million students. Kaftanov said: If one compares the achievements of the Soviet state with the state of education in capitalist countries, these achievements are very prominent. In the United States, there are as many as 20 million illiterate adults, and 6 million children do not attend school.
　　The number of experts from institutions of higher education in various sectors of the national economy and culture is constantly increasing. In the ten years before the war alone, Soviet higher education institutions trained approximately one million engineers, agriculturalists, teachers, doctors, and other experts.

　　苏联已实行普遍教育
　  现有二十二万余所学校和三千三百余万名学生
    苏联政府业已实施了以苏联各民族语言教授的普遍的少年教育。现有二十二万余所学校和三千三百万余名学生。卡夫坦诺夫说：如果人们要拿苏维埃国家的成就和资本主义国家的教育状况比较，则这些成就是很突出的。在美国，成年人当中竟有二千万文盲，而且有六百万儿童没有进学校。
    国民经济与文化各部门中来自高等学校的专家的数目，正在不断增加。仅仅是战前十年中，苏联高等教育机关便培养了约一百万工程师、农业学家、教师、医生及其他专家等。
