Beijing News: Workers in public and private factories in Beijing are enthusiastically celebrating the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin and are elaborately crafting various gifts to send to him. In addition to holding discussion forums and celebrations, workers at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory in the fitter, forging, casting, lathe, and carpentry departments proposed increasing production as a gift. Workers at the Beijing Post Office, Fengtai Bridge Factory, and other factories launched a signature campaign to offer birthday greetings. The signature book was bound with Chinese-made paper (Red Tiger Skin Xuan paper) and signed with calligraphy brushes, so that Marshal Stalin could immediately recognize the respect that the Chinese working class was offering him. The Fengtai Bridge Factory first drew a red star in the center of the signature paper, with a portrait of Stalin in the upper corner, and artistic characters of "Long Live Stalin" in the middle, with the signatures outside the star, expressing support for Stalin. The Beijing History Museum is also collecting signatures to offer birthday greetings and raising funds to make a brocade banner as a gift. An old worker said when signing, "It's really a great honor for us to be able to write our names and send them to Stalin!" The Qinghe Woolen Mill selected a set of the best clothing fabric produced by the factory, along with a sash, to offer to Stalin as a birthday gift. Workers at the Beijing Water Company will offer "the four treasures of the study" – two ivory writing brushes, an ancient inkstone, a set of seals, and a box of ancient ink – as a gift. The Workers' Daily staff has prepared three gifts to send to Stalin: the entire staff is sending an eight-foot-long birthday banner, the CCP branch is sending a pair of cloisonné vases, and the Youth League branch is sending a complete set of the Workers' Daily publications in hardcover editions. All the workers of the private Dahua Pottery Company decided to rush to make a set of longevity bowls before the 21st to send to Marshal Stalin. They selected six white blanks with the best colors, and Jin Jihou, a technician specializing in painting flowers in the Jin kiln, painted a large peach tree with several large red peaches, with green lingzhi grass growing beside the roots, and a pair of bats flying on the tree, symbolizing fortune and longevity. Workers at the South Factory of the Tram Company made a decorated float, with a huge portrait of Stalin erected in front of the float, with a large "Longevity" character made of red paper below. On the 21st, the workers will sit on this float and set out for street propaganda. In addition, the Clothing Factory Cooperative and the China People's Printing Factory have also prepared elaborate gifts to offer.
