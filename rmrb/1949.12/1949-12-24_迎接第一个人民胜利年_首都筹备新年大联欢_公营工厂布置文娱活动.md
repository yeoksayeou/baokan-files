　　Ushering in the First Year of People's Victory
    The Capital Prepares for a New Year's Grand Celebration
    State-Owned Factories Arrange Cultural and Recreational Activities
    [Beijing News] The people of the capital will celebrate the first New Year after the birth of New China with unprecedented joy. The Beijing New Year's Grand Celebration, initiated by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Student Federation, and the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Democratic Youth Federation, and jointly organized by more than 20 institutions and organizations including the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Education Union, is scheduled to be held simultaneously in Zhongshan Park and Beihai Park on January 2, 1950. The activities include sports, entertainment, and cultural programs. Sports activities include an ice sports meet—a costume skating performance, figure skating competition, speed skating competition, and ice hockey exhibition match, as well as a 10,000-meter cross-country relay race starting from the back gate of Beihai Park, passing through Zhongshan Park, through the front gate of Zhongnanhai, to the White Pagoda Peak of Beihai.
    Among the entertainment activities, the most politically significant and interesting is the "Search for Reactionaries and Earn Merit Competition." This entertainment method involves the organizers hiding paper cards with the names of reactionaries in various corners of the park, and then mobilizing young people to search for them. Prizes will be awarded based on the search results. Those who can individually or collectively find the head war criminal Chiang Kai-shek's portrait, which has been cut into several pieces and hidden in various places, will receive a special prize.
    These activities, as well as the singing, drama performances, wall newspapers, drawings, games, lectures, and symposiums prepared by various factories, schools, and organizations, will be combined with political and ideological education, mainly based on the "Instructions on Carrying Out Mass Propaganda and Literary and Artistic Work for the New Year and Spring Festival" issued by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government.
    [Beijing News] The Propaganda and Education Group of the State-Owned Industrial Workers' Work Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee convened a joint meeting of propaganda and education committee members of various state-owned factory trade unions on the 22nd of this month to arrange New Year's cultural and recreational activities and radio education. Representatives from 24 units, including the 70th Arsenal, participated. At the meeting, various factories expressed their opinions on the New Year's cultural and recreational activities. Some factories are preparing to hold joint celebrations with students, farmers, and workers from other factories. According to reports from various factories, workers and literary and artistic comrades from the factories have also created many short plays, such as "Two Thousand Bolts of Cloth" from the Clothing Factory, "Celebrating the New Year" from the Xinhua Printing Factory, and "The Knife Presentation" from the Liulihe Cement Plant. The content mainly focuses on how to actively produce, overcome difficulties, and complete the great task of economic construction. In addition, there are also songs, clapper talks, and other creations. These new creations by the workers will be performed at the evening party. Through this New Year's celebration, workers' cultural and recreational activities will be further advanced.

　　迎接第一个人民胜利年
    首都筹备新年大联欢
    公营工厂布置文娱活动
    【北京讯】首都各界人民将以前所未有的愉快心情来庆祝新中国诞生后的第一个新年。由青年团北京市工委会、市学联和市民主青年联合会筹委会所发起，并联合市教育局、市总工会、教联等二十余机关、团体筹备举办的北京市新年大联欢，定于一九五○年元月二日在中山公园和北海公园同时举行。活动内容分体育、娱乐和文艺等数项。体育活动包括冰上运动会——化装溜冰表演、花样比赛、速度比赛和冰球表演比赛，以及起自北海公园后门，穿过中山公园，经中南海前门至北海白塔顶长达一万公尺的越野登高接力赛。
    娱乐活动中最富政治意义和趣味的一项是“搜索反动派立功比赛”。这种娱乐方法是由大会把画有反动派姓名的纸牌分藏团内各个角落，然后发动青年们搜索。根据搜索成绩，分别给奖。如能个人或集体搜得分藏在各处已剪成数份的头号战犯蒋介石画片者将获得特等奖。
    这些活动以及各工厂、学校、机关所准备的歌唱、演剧、壁报、图画、游戏、讲演和座谈会等，均将与政治思想教育结合进行，主要是根据中央人民政府文化、教育两部“关于开展年节、春节群众宣传工作和文艺工作的指示”进行宣传。
    【北京讯】市总工会筹委会公营产业工人工作委员会宣教组于本月二十二日召开各公营工厂工会宣教委员联席会，布置新年文化娱乐活动及广播教育等工作。参加的有七十兵工厂等二十四个单位。会上，各厂对新年文化娱乐活动纷纷发表意见，有些工厂准备和学生、农民及别厂工人举行联欢。又根据各厂汇报，工人及工厂文艺工作同志还创作了很多短剧，如被服厂的“二千匹布”，新华印刷厂的“过新年”，琉璃河水泥厂的“献刀”等。内容多为如何积极生产、克服困难完成伟大的经济建设任务等。此外，还有歌、快板等创作。这些工人的新创作都将在晚会演出，通过这次新年联欢，将使工人文化娱乐活动更向前推进一步。
