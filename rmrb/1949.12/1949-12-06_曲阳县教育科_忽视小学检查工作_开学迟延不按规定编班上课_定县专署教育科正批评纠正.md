【Hebei News】Due to leadership's neglect of inspection and failure to resolve problems promptly, primary schools in Quyang County, Dingxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, have experienced delayed school openings or prolonged periods without classes after opening. The original date for primary schools to open was October 13th. By November 1st, inspections in ten villages across three districts revealed that none had opened. Those that did open did not follow upper-level regulations for curriculum and grade organization. At Xiaolin Complete Primary School, students graduating at the end of the year were divided into three levels for arithmetic study; primary schools in Yannan, Wende, Pushang and other villages did not form classes according to upper-level regulations. Many teachers, due to unresolved supply issues, were forced to go door-to-door to beg for grain, making it impossible for them to concentrate on teaching. The main cause of this phenomenon is the untimely inspections and the lack of clear rewards and punishments by the county government's education section. The Prefectural Education Section has criticized Quyang County and is conducting a review and rectification.

    【河北讯】河北省定县专区曲阳县的教育工作，由于领导上忽视检查，解决问题不及时，各村小学开学迟延或开学后久不上课。各小学原订十月十三日开学，到了十一月一日，据三个区十个村检查，都没开学。个别开学的，编级教程也不按上级规定进行。晓林完小年底毕业的学生，学习算术一班分三级；燕南、文德、铺上等村小学不按上级规定编班。不少的教师因供给问题未解决，挨户去要粮，不能安心上课。发生这种现象的原因，主要是县政府教育科检查不及时，赏罚不严明。专署教育科已向曲阳县提出批评，正进行检讨纠正。
