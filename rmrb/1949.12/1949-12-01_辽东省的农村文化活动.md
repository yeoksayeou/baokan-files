　　Rural Cultural Activities in Liaodong Province
  　I. Initial Activities

    After the liberation, the peasants generally have a demand for recreational activities, and many places have organized peasant theater troupes. This spring, Tonghua had twenty-eight theater troupes in twenty-two natural villages; Fushong had twenty-two theater troupes in rural areas, in addition to the nine in the urban area; Xinbin also organized thirty-odd theater troupes during the Spring Festival.

    Before last winter, rural cultural and recreational work was mostly in a state of laissez-faire, and many theater troupes were put together temporarily for the Spring Festival or publicity weeks, and disbanded after the performances.

    It was not until after the great victory of Jinzhou-Changchun that the counties began to consciously and systematically lead this work. For example, last winter Fushong gathered the mass theater troupes in the county to participate in a joint performance for the victory celebration. An "Performance Evaluation Committee" was organized in advance, and finally a forum was held for the performing units to review the content of the scripts, exchange performance experience, and give material and spiritual rewards to those with more advantages. Gushan County also organized "Awarding Committees" in each area to bring together the theater troupes and Yangko teams from various villages for competitions, and then awarded prizes to the first, second, and third place winners.

    II. How Did the Theater Movement Develop?

    At the beginning of the theater movement, individual village cadres used coercive "mass action" methods. The masses regarded it as an order from above, and some women were even afraid to go to literacy classes to avoid performing Yangko. These deviations were quickly corrected.

    According to Fushong's statistics this spring, more than twenty of the county's seventy-odd natural villages had peasant theater troupes. Peasants are very interested in performing plays. In some villages, under the leadership of cadres, a trend has been created, and women are no longer ashamed to perform.

    Now, the rural Yangko has basically changed from the vulgar and low-level tastes of the past; in terms of scripts, it has gradually moved from performing foreign scripts to self-writing and self-performing. Because the content of the scripts can address the specific situation in rural areas and combine with the current central work, the peasants are more welcome. They said, "Watching such plays can open our minds!"

    There has also been some success in improving Yangko. For example, when Fushong was engaged in sideline production last autumn, some Yangko teams played "cutting grass," "logging," "picking mushrooms," and "preventing livestock from eating crops." The Yangko teams in various villages in Andong County also played "plowing," "sowing," and "applying manure." In addition, some teams based their performances on Hua Junwu's cartoons, performing many political struggle tableaux, such as "American Imperialism Giving Old Chiang Kai-shek a Stimulant" and "Giving Old Chiang Kai-shek a Funeral," which were also most popular with the peasants.

    III. A Few Experiences

    Based on past experience, the following suggestions can be used as a reference for carrying out rural cultural and recreational work—mainly the theater movement:

    1.  Cultural and recreational activities should be carried out not only during the Spring Festival, but also during the slack farming season, especially in winter, according to the specific conditions and possibilities of the peasants.

    2.  Pay attention to the organization and leadership of district and village cadres.

    3.  The leadership should pay attention to cultivating models. It is best for each district to have a key village theater troupe, which should not only serve as a village model, but also help those village theater troupes with weaker foundations.

    4.  Address the masses' ideological concerns, combine with the current central work, and do what you make, and perform what you do. This not only plays a propaganda and educational role, but is also welcomed by the peasants.

    5.  Collective writing and directing should be widely promoted, so as to give play to the creativity of the peasants and easily improve the quality of the scripts.

    6.  More small-scale entertainment evenings can be held, where those who can play can play, those who can sing can sing, and Yangko acrobatics are all acceptable. This is not only unrestrained, but also simple and easy. This form not only can be done by the peasants themselves, but also can discover talents from here.

    7.  Regarding Yangko, it is still necessary to continue to eliminate vulgar and pornographic content, and incorporate more rhythmic storytelling and ditties with new lyrics.

    8.  In terms of form, Yangko should create more steps and twists to break the old patterns, so that the dancing is more energetic and the audience is more interested. Stilt walking and land boats can also be used, but new content should be inserted.

    9.  All self-written scripts and street tableaux should be submitted to the higher authorities for review. Those with good content and performance effects can be given the opportunity to publish, or given bonuses as appropriate.

    10. An performance competition can be held every Spring Festival on a district basis, with awards given to the best.

    11. Attention should be paid to frugality, preventing forced apportionment for the sake of performing plays and Yangko, excessive eating and drinking, extravagance and waste, and the bad phenomenon of a few people taking the opportunity to enrich themselves.

### 辽东省的农村文化活动

　　辽东省的农村文化活动
  　一、初期活动状况
    翻身后的农民，普遍有文娱活动的要求，很多地方都组织了农民剧团。如今春，通化在二十二个自然村中就有二十八个剧团；抚松除掉城区的九个剧团外，农村还有二十二个剧团；新宾在春节时候也组织起三十几个剧团。
    去年冬以前，农村文娱工作多处于自流状态，有很多剧团是春节或宣传周临时拼凑成的，演完也就解散了。
    直到锦长大捷以后，各县才开始有意识、有计划地来领导这一工作。如抚松去冬曾将各群众剧团召集到县里来，参加祝捷大会的联合公演，事先统一组织了“演出评议委员会”，最后又召集演出各单位举行座谈会，检计剧本内容，交流演出经验，对优点较多的给予物质和精神的奖励。孤山县也在各地以区为单位，组织了“评奖委员会”，把各村的剧团与秧歌队，齐集一处进行比赛；然后分别按一、二、三等给予奖品。
    二、剧运是怎样开展起来的？
    在开展剧运之初，个别的村干部使用了强迫命令的“大轰”方式，群众把它当作上级命令，甚至于有些妇女为了逃避扭秧歌，竟连识字班都不敢去了，这些偏向很快就纠正了。
    据抚松今春统计，全县七十几个自然村中，有农民参加的剧团已有二十多个。农民对演剧很感兴趣，有的村在干部带头下，造成了风气，妇女演剧也不害臊了。
    现在，农村秧歌基本上已改变了过去那套庸俗的低级趣味；在剧本上也由演外来的剧本，逐渐走向自编自演了。因为剧本本的内容，能够针对农村具体情况，结合当前中心工作，农民是更加欢迎的。他们说：“看这样的剧，能够开脑筋！”
    在秧歌改进方面，也有一定成绩。如去秋抚松正搞副业生产时，有的秧歌队就扮演了“割草”、“放山”、“捡磨菇”和“防止啃青”的活报等。安东县的各村秧歌队，也扮演了“扶犁”、“播种”、“上粪”等，另外有的则根据华君武的漫画，扮演出了许多政治斗争的活报剧，如“美帝给老蒋打强心剂”与“给老蒋出殡”等，也最为农民所欢迎。
    三、几点经验
    根据以往的经验，对开展农村文化娱乐工作——主要是剧运，有下面的一些意见可作参考：
    １、不但要在春节中进行文娱活动，而且在农闲期间特别是冬季，应该根据农民的具体情况与可能，有季节地进行文娱活动。
    ２、重视区村干部的组织领导。
    ３、领导上应注意培养典型，最好各区都能够掌握一个重点村剧团，这剧团除了作为一个村榜样外，它还应该帮助那些基础较差的村剧团。
    ４、针对群众的思想顾虑，结合当前中心工作，做到作什么编什么、演什么，这样不但起了宣教作用，而且也受农民欢迎。
    ５、应该广泛提倡集体编导，这样可以发挥农民的创造性，也容易提高剧本的质量。
    ６、可以多搞小型的娱乐晚会，作到会拉的拉，会唱的唱，秧歌杂耍都行，既不拘束，又简单省事。这样形式不但农民自己可以搞，而且可以从这里发现人材。
    ７、关于秧歌还要继续肃清庸俗的色情的东西。多穿插些快板，和填新词的小调。
    ８、秧歌在形式上，要多创造步法扭法，打破老一套，这样扭的才起劲，看的才感兴趣。高跷、旱船的形式也可用，但要插入新内容。
    ９、凡自编的剧本和街头活报，都应交上级检查一下，内容和演出效果较好的可给以出版机会，或酌发奖金。
    １０、每年春节可以举行以区为单位的演出比赛，好的给奖。
    １１、要注意节约，防止为了演剧、闹秧歌强行摊派，大吃大喝，奢侈浪费及少数人乘机自肥的坏现象。
