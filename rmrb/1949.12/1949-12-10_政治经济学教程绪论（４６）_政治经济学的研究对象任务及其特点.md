  　The Object, Task, and Characteristics of Political Economy
    Section 2: The Historical Development and Predictive Nature of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    The Strength of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy Lies in its Predictive Power
    The strength of Marxist-Leninist political economy, and the Communist Party armed with it, lies in its scientific and great foresight. Because it possesses this scientific foresight, it has confidence, direction, and the ability to inspire and guide the working class and the laboring people forward. Because of this scientific foresight, Marxist-Leninist political economy can become a powerful theoretical and fighting weapon. Therefore, the proletariat party armed with Marxism-Leninism can become a powerful party. "The strength of Marxist-Leninist theory lies in its ability to enable the Party to discern the situation, understand the internal connections of surrounding events, and predict the course of events. It can not only perceive how events are developing and where they are heading at present, but also how they will develop and where they will head in the future. Only a party that is proficient in Marxist-Leninist theory can advance with confidence and lead the working class forward. Conversely, a party that is not proficient in Marxist-Leninist theory will have to wander and grope, lack confidence in its actions, and be unable to lead the working class forward." (Concluding Remarks of the Brief History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) This predictive nature of Marxist-Leninist political economy is generally embodied in the Party's program and policies.

    For example, the powerful people's force formed by the cause of the Chinese people's liberation today, and the great victory of the People's Liberation War and the New Democratic Revolution, are the result of the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Mao Zedong as the core. This includes Comrade Mao Zedong's correct financial and economic policies and the significant achievements and enormous role played by the New Democratic economic construction work in various liberated areas under the leadership of correct financial and economic policies. If the revolutionary party and the revolutionary regime had not paid sufficient attention, used great efforts, and had correct guidelines and policies to engage in New Democratic economic construction during the revolution, we would not have been able to support the war, especially such a long and brutal war, and we would not have been able to maintain the people's livelihood during the war. During the long and brutal Soviet war, the national war, and the People's Liberation War, the lives of the people in the liberated areas were significantly different from those in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas or in capitalist countries with highly developed economies during wartime. During World War II, the lives of the proletariat and other laboring people in capitalist countries were extremely low and painful. Even the bourgeoisie themselves could only live on potatoes (such as in Paris, France). All capitalist countries implemented a rationing system for living materials. For example, in the United States, apart from sixty large capitalists who made huge fortunes and reaped huge wartime profits, the lives of the general population were greatly reduced. However, in the people's liberated areas of China, during the past eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people's lives were not only maintained but also generally improved. For example, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region achieved abundance during the War of Resistance, and other anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines, despite frequent and brutal enemy mopping-up operations and constant attacks by floods, droughts, and insect plagues, were generally self-sufficient, and the people's lives were appropriately improved, with a certain surplus (such as "cultivating four, surplus one" or "cultivating three, surplus one" in agricultural production). The purpose of the revolution is to develop production, develop productive forces, improve people's lives, and promote social progress. This goal has been preliminarily realized in the past through the efforts of the Party and the people. However, its complete realization will depend on greater efforts after the nationwide victory of the People's Liberation War, and on the development and victory of economic construction work after our victory in the revolutionary war. But whether it is the past, present, or future of the Chinese revolution, it can prove the great role and significance of Marxist-Leninist political economy and Comrade Mao Zedong's financial and economic thought and policies (the concrete embodiment of the Sinicization of Marxist-Leninist political economy theory) for the Chinese revolution and China's New Democratic economic construction, thus also enabling us to appreciate the importance of the Party's requirement for us to study Marxist-Leninist political economy and Mao Zedong's financial and economic policies, that is, to study theory and policy.
    The Inevitable Decline and Death of Bourgeois Political Economy
    Compared with bourgeois political economy, this developmental or progressive nature, and predictive or far-sighted nature of Marxist-Leninist political economy, are characteristics that bourgeois political economy does not have and cannot possibly possess. Although bourgeois political economy is also a product of a certain history, that is, a product of the period when capitalist society arose, was established, and developed, its existence and development can only be within this limit and can never exceed this certain limit. That is, when bourgeois political economy develops to a certain height, it begins its history of decline and vulgarization, and in the period when capitalism is heading towards decline and death, bourgeois political economy will inevitably decline and die with it. Although there will still be the existence and development of political economy in the new society, what exists and develops is not the declining and dying bourgeois political economy, but the Marxist-Leninist political economy that is hostile to it.

    The narrowness of the class represented by bourgeois political economy, and the destiny of the class it represents, determine that its development must inevitably decline and die when it reaches a certain limit, and be replaced by Marxist-Leninist political economy. This is completely consistent with the inevitable decline and death of the bourgeoisie, the inevitable decline and death of capitalist society, and the inevitable rise of the proletariat and the inevitable replacement of capitalist society by socialist society, and is completely based on the irresistible objective necessity of social existence.

    Bourgeois Political Economy Not Only Demonstrates its Backwardness but also its Impotence
    The proletariat political economy possesses scientific predictive or far-sightedness, which is something that bourgeois political economy does not have and cannot possibly have. Furthermore, from this aspect alone, bourgeois political economy not only demonstrates its backwardness but also its fragility and impotence. Bourgeois political economy, even when it possesses scientificity, its analysis of social and economic forms only has a certain range and degree of truthfulness. Beyond this limit, it shows its impotence. They regard the capitalist socio-economy not as a temporary transitional stage in history, but as an absolute, eternal, final, and most complete economic form. Therefore, it cannot and cannot possibly foresee and recognize the decline and death of capitalism, and cannot and cannot possibly foresee and predict that a higher-level socialist economic form will inevitably replace it. In particular, vulgar bourgeois political economists not only fully demonstrate their incompetence in this regard, but also fully expose their confusion and reaction. This vulgar bourgeois political economy has its development in capitalist countries under the support and employment of the bourgeoisie. They strive to cover up and attempt to reconcile and save the contradictions of capitalist society. Apart from using lies to deceive the people, they cannot do anything else about the facts that constantly occur and expose the contradictions of capitalist society. They not only cannot discover the laws of capitalist economic movement, but even openly believe that the development of social economy is not governed by any laws. They think that economy is just the development of economic facts. Therefore, their economic doctrines only consist of a list of economic phenomena. For example, the German historical school scholar Schmoller listed many interest rate figures to show that the development of interest rates over the years was just fluctuating highs and lows without any laws. The psychological school's investigation of value does not start from the production aspect, that is, it does not investigate from the aspect of labor forming value, but explains value from aspects such as human needs, psychology, utility, and desires. The historical school can be said to see trees but not the forest, so they cannot see the laws existing in many economic phenomena, and even if they see them, they do not admit them. Although the psychological school also knows how to explore economic laws, it does not start from the observation of long-term and large-scale phenomena in the social economy, but only grasps some special, temporary, small, isolated, and individual phenomena in the social economy, and uses these individual, temporary, small, and isolated phenomena to impose on the long-term and large-scale phenomena existing in society, and forcibly believes that these isolated phenomena and the long-term and large-scale phenomena are the same law.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（４６）
  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第二节马列主义政治经济学的历史性发展性与预见性
    马列主义政治经济学的所有力量也在于有预见性
    马列主义政治经济学与由马列主义政治经济学武装起来的共产党，其所以有力量，也就是由于他具有这种科学的伟大的预见性或远见性。由于它具有这种科学的预见性，因此它也就有信心、有方向，能鼓舞它前进，并引导工人阶级与劳动人民一起前进。因为有这种科学的预见性或远见性，所以马列主义政治经济学也就能够成为强有力的理论武器和斗争武器。所以马列主义武装起来的无产阶级政党，也就能够成为强有力的政党。“马列主义理论强有力的地方，就在于它使党能判明局势，能了解周围事变底内在联系，能预察事变底进程，不仅能察知事变在目前怎样发展和向何处发展，而且能察知事变在将来会怎样发展和向何处发展。只有精通了马列主义理论的党，才能确有把握地向前进展，才能引导工人阶级前进。反之，没有精通马列主义理论的党，却不得不徘徊摸索，在行动上没有把握，不能领导工人阶级前进。”（联共党史简明教程结束语）马列主义政治经济学的这种预见性，一般是体现在党的纲领与政策里面。
    例如：今天中国人民解放事业所形成的强大的人民力量，人民解放战争与新民主主义革命事业的伟大胜利，是由于以毛泽东同志为中心的党中央正确领导的结果。其中包括着毛泽东同志正确的财经政策和在正确有财经政策领导下各解放区新民主主义经济建设工作在这方面所获得的重大成就与所起的巨大作用在内。如果革命的党，革命的政权在革命过程中没有以足够的注意，没有用很大的力量，也没有正确的路线方针政策来从事新民主主义的经济建设，我们也就无法支援战争，尤其无法支持这样长期的残酷的战争，也无法在战争中维持人民的生活，在长期残酷的苏维埃战争，民族战争与人民解放军战争中，解放区人民的生活，不论与蒋匪区或者与资本主义高度发展各国战时人民的生活比较起来，都是有着显著的区别的。第二次世界大战中，在资本主义各国内，无产阶级及其他劳动人民的生活，都是过的极度低下痛苦的生活，即使连资产阶级本身也只能以洋薯度日者（如法国巴黎），各资本主义国家都实行生活资料的定量配给制，例如美国除六十家大资产阶级大发其财，攫得巨额战时利润以外，一般人民的生活，都是大大地降低了。但在中国的人民解放区，在过去八年抗日战争中，人民的生活，不但能够维持，而且一般地还能初步地改善。即如抗日时期陕甘宁边区曾做到丰衣足食，其他敌后各抗日根据地，虽在敌人频繁残酷的扫荡清剿与水旱虫天灾不断袭击下，一般也还能自给自足，人民生活也能得到适当改善，并且有一定的剩余（如农业生产中的耕四余一，耕三余一等）。革命的目的是为了发展生产，发展生产力，改善人民生活，推动社会前进，这个目标过去曾经依靠党与人民的努力，曾经得到了初步的实现，但其彻底的实现，还是将要有待于人民解放战争全国胜利以后更大的努力，有待于我们在革命战争胜利后经过经济建设工作的开展与胜利，但是不论中国革命的过去、现在或将来都可使我们得到证明：马列主义政治经济学与毛泽东同志的财政经济思想与财政经济政策（马列主义政治经济学理论中国化的具体体现）对中国革命与中国新民主主义经济建设的伟大作用和意义，从而也可以使我们体会党要求我们学习马列主义政治经济学及毛泽东财经政策即学习理论与政策的重要性了。
    资产阶级政治经济学没落死亡的必然性
    与资产阶级政治经济学对比起来，马列主义政治经济学的这种发展性或前进性，预见性或远见性，是资产阶级政治经济学所没有也是不可能具有的特点。资产阶级政治经济学虽然也是一定的历史的产物，即是在资本主义社会发生成立发展时期的产物，但是它的存在与发展，只能是在这一种限度以内，决不能再行超过这一定的限度而发展了。即资产阶级政治经济学发展到一定高度的时候，就开始了它没落的庸俗化的历史，而在资本主义走向没落死亡的时期，资产阶级政治经济学也必然将随之没落死亡，在新社会里虽然仍将有政治经济学的存在发展，但存在发展的已不是没落死亡的资产阶级政治经济学，而是与它敌对的马列主义政治经济学了。
    资产阶级政治经济学由于它所代表的阶级的狭隘性，由于它所代表阶级的命运，决定了它的发展，达到了一定的限度必然地要走向没落，归于死亡，而为马列主义政治经济学所代替，这正与资产阶级必然要没落死亡，资本主义社会必然要没落死亡，而无产阶级必然要兴起，社会主义社会必然要代替资本主义社会而兴起，乃是完全一致的，完全依据于社会存在的不可抗拒的客观的必然性的。
    资产阶级政治经济学不但表现其落后而且表现其无力
    无产阶级政治经济学具有科学的预见性或远见性，也是资产阶级政治经济学所没有和不可能具有的。并且单从这方面说来，资产阶级政治经济学不但表现其落后，而且更表现其脆弱无力。资产阶级政治经济学，纵令在它带有科学性的时候，它对于社会经济形态的分析，也只不过具有一定范围一定程度的真理性，超过这限度就表现其无力，他们把资本主义的社会经济，不是看做历史上暂时的过渡的阶段，而是当作绝对的永恒的最后的最完备的经济形态看待，因此它就不能也不可能预见与承认资本主义的没落死亡，不能也不可能预见与预言要有更高级的社会主义经济形态将必然地代替它而兴起。尤其庸俗派的资产阶级政治经济学者，在这一点上，不但充分表现了它的无能，而且更十足的暴露了它的混乱与反动。这种庸俗的资产阶级政治经济学，在资本主义各国在资产阶级支持御用下都有它的发展，他们努力掩盖并企图调和挽救资本主义社会的矛盾，对资本主义社会所不断发生的暴露资本主义社会的矛盾的一些事实，除去用谎言来欺骗人民以外，就不能作出任何别的事情来。他们不但不能发现资本主义经济运动的规律，甚至于还公然认为社会经济的发展是无所谓规律的，他们以为经济就是经济事实的发展，因此，他们的经济学说，只有一些经济现象的罗列，例如德国历史学派的学者希姆拉曾列举了许多利率的数目字，来说明利率多年来的发展只是高高低低并没有什么规律存在。心理学派对价值的考察也不是从生产方面出发，即不从劳动形成价值方面来考察，而从人的需要、心理、效用、欲望等方面来说明价值。历史学派可以说是见树不见林，所以他们对许多经济现象中存在着规律也看不到，即使看见了也不承认。心理学派虽也知道探求经济规律，但是却不是从社会经济长期的大量的现象观察出发，而只是抓住社会经济中某些特殊的暂时的小量的孤立的个别现象，并以这些个别的暂时的小量的孤立的现象，去套社会上长期大量存在的现象，强以为这些孤立现象与长期大量的现象是同一规律。
