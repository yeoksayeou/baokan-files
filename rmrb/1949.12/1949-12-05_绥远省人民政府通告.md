　　Notice from the People's Government of Suiyuan Province

　　It has been found that our army seized a portion of postal parcels abandoned by the enemy when it liberated Jining last year. Our People's Government has repeatedly notified the owners to collect them in order to protect the people's property. Recently, in addition to the majority being returned, there is still a portion that cannot be notified due to unknown addresses. Therefore, this notice is published requesting the owners to present their original receipts to the Fengzhen Post Office for collection. The deadline for collection is half a month from the date of publication. Unclaimed parcels will be handled as undeliverable parcels.

　　The names of the original owners are listed below: Beijing: Wang Zongying, Jin Dewu, Liu Xijiu, Dachang Zhan Yang Shulin, No. 34 Xie Jia Hutong Song, Yuhua Hao, Ju Shun Zhan, Yongsheng Qi, Dazhong Leather Shop, Ji Shangzuo, Zhang Yong, Houji Leather Shop, Xinyi He, Tong He Yi, Yang Ruilin. Tianjin: Sun Xinguo, Yu Feng Company, He Ju Factory, Zhenye Company, Yu Changxiang. Zhangjiakou: Wang Zhao, Wang Fengying. Datong: Wang Lixuan, No. 19 Zhonglou Street.
