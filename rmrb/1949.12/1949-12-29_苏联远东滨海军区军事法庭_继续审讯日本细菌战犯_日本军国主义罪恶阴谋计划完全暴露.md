Xinhua News Agency, Khabarovsk, December 27th: Trial of former Japanese military personnel accused of preparing and using bacteriological weapons.

　　Trial of the Defendant Tomio Karasawa
　　The court opened on the morning of December 26th, first interrogating the defendant Tomio Karasawa, who was the section chief of the production department of Unit 731. The head of this department was the defendant Kiyoshi Kawashima.
　　Karasawa, a doctor and bacteriologist, was an active organizer in the mass production of bacteriological weapons. From 1940 to 1942, the defendant personally participated in supplying bacteria to the Special Detachment of the Central China Expeditionary Army for use in bacteriological warfare. From 1943 to 1944, he directly participated in the heinous experiments of using deadly bacteria on prisoners.
　　The defendant served in Unit 731 for five years. Initially, he was a junior staff member; subsequently, due to his "zeal" in mass-producing bacteriological weapons and slaughtering people, he was gradually promoted to the position of section chief.
　　The defendant testified that in Unit 731, large-scale experiments were conducted on batches of living people in both laboratory and field environments. He further stated that in the section he led, there were two sets of equipment for the mass production of bacteria. Each set had six boilers for manufacturing culture media for cultivating bacteria. The total capacity of the boilers was eight tons. In addition, there was other equipment needed for mass-producing bacteriological weapons, including the "incubators" invented by Shiro Ishii, which were therefore called "Ishii-style incubators." The deadly bacteria produced by Karasawa on a mass scale were used as bacteriological weapons against the Chinese people and also used in experiments on living people.

　　Karasawa admitted: Large-scale bacteriological experiments were conducted on living people (including American prisoners of war)
　　The plague was spread in Ningbo in September 1940.
　　The defendant Karasawa continued to testify that in the first half of 1944, a considerable portion of the equipment of Unit 731 was dispersed to various detachments. This was partly to minimize the loss of Unit 731's manufacturing capacity due to possible bombing, and partly to increase the capacity for producing bacteriological weapons for war.
　　In order to determine the degree of infection of American troops to various operational bacteria, personnel from Unit 731 studied the susceptibility of American prisoners of war to various infectious diseases.
　　Answering questions from the state prosecutor, Karasawa testified: In early 1943, when I was sick in the Shenyang hospital, a scientific staff member of Unit 731 named Minato came to see me. He told me that in Shenyang, the immunity of American prisoners of war to infectious diseases was being studied.
　　Minato was specially dispatched by Unit 731 to prisoner-of-war camps to study the immunity of the Anglo-Saxon race to infectious diseases.
　　Prosecutor: Did you foresee the prospect of using bacteriological weapons against the United States?
　　Karasawa: That's right. I foresaw that prospect.
　　The defendant continued to confess that he personally participated in experiments at Anda Station to determine the activity of anthrax on living people in combat locations. At that time, electric currents were used to detonate explosive bombs in order to infect living people tied to pillars. As a result, a large number of people were infected with anthrax, and they were taken back to the prison of Unit 731. Most of them died there. The defendant also described experiments on the activity of plague bacteria cultured by his section.
　　Answering questions from the prosecutor, Karasawa admitted to the activities of the special detachment dispatched by Unit 731 to the China mainland and that he actively participated in the preparation work for the detachment. In September 1940, this detachment, led by Lieutenant General and Medical Officer Shiro Ishii, arrived in the Hangzhou area and used bacteriological weapons near the city of Ningbo. Soon after, plague broke out in Ningbo. Karasawa also testified that in 1942, a similar detachment was sent to the China mainland.
　　The court continued to interrogate the defendant Yamada.

　　Trial of the Defendant Otozo Yamada
　　Otozo Yamada held several important positions in the Japanese Army. From the end of 1938 to October 1939, he was the commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in Central China (headquarters in Nanjing). From October 1939 to 1944, he was the Inspector General of Military Training of the Japanese Army, and also a member of the Supreme Military Council, and for a period served as the Commander-in-Chief of Japanese Defense. From July 1944 until the surrender to the Soviet Army, he was the Commander of the Kwantung Army.
　　In his capacity as Commander of the Kwantung Army, Yamada personally supervised, and through his subordinates, supervised the preparation for bacteriological warfare. He repeatedly received reports from the heads of the two special units, 731 and 100, and took all measures to ensure that these two units were ready for combat and capable of large-scale production and use of bacteriological weapons.
　　Yamada admitted that he directly commanded bacteriological warfare units, mainly designed to be used against the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China.
　　Yamada testified that while he was Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, Unit 731 and Unit 100 were under his direct command, and the activities of these two units were extremely secret. Within days of Yamada's assumption of the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, he received reports from General Kajitsuka and General Takahashi, who are now sitting in the dock, regarding the progress of Unit 731 and Unit 100 in preparing for bacteriological warfare. Shortly thereafter, Yamada personally inspected Unit 731 and, as he said, he was amazed at the enormous number of plague bombs that had already been manufactured and the unit's capacity to produce bacteriological weapons on a large scale.
　　The defendant stated: I believe that the production capacity of Unit 731 was sufficient to supply the use of bacteriological weapons in large-scale warfare.
　　Answering questions from the state prosecutor, Yamada admitted that bacteriological weapons were mainly designed to be used against the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic, and China; however, they were also intended to be used against the United States and Britain.
　　Yamada then testified that in March 1945, the Kwantung Army Headquarters received instructions from the Japanese military headquarters to increase the production of bacteriological weapons. In order to implement this order, he took measures to equip Unit 731 with experts and increase equipment. He also instructed the headquarters of Unit 100 to strengthen bacteriological reconnaissance in areas bordering the Soviet Union.
　　The prosecutor presented to the defendant Yamada a photographic copy of a work report of a special team of Unit 100 conducting bacteriological reconnaissance in areas bordering the Soviet Union. Yamada admitted that such reconnaissance and similar reconnaissance were carried out in preparation for an anti-Soviet war.
　　During the court interrogation, the defendant Yamada continued to testify that the Kwantung Army had conducted research on the most effective methods of using bacteriological weapons. A special committee composed of the Chief of Staff, the Director of the Military Strategy Staff Office, and the commanders of various bacteriological units discussed these methods. The various types of bacteriological weapons and the methods considered to be the most effective for their use were reported to the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army.
　　Yamada had participated in the preparation for Japanese bacteriological warfare even before becoming Commander of the Kwantung Army.
　　The sinister conspiratorial plans of Japanese militarists were revealed more and more prominently during the trial. At the request of the state prosecutor, the court read out the so-called "Operational Order for Sabotage Groups"; this order was issued in January 1944 by the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army and the Inspector General of Military Training, at which time Yamada was the Inspector General of Military Training. A section of this "order" put forward instructions on methods for using bacteriological weapons for sabotage purposes.
　　Prosecutor: Defendant Yamada, was this "order" drafted by the Military Training Directorate under your command? Yamada: Yes, these "orders" were jointly drafted by the Military Training Directorate and the General Staff.
　　Prosecutor: Does this mean that even before you were appointed Commander of the Kwantung Army, you were involved in the preparation for bacteriological warfare? Yamada: Yes, that is correct.
　　Yamada then testified that he personally favored Ishii-style bombs, spraying bacteria from airplanes, and conducting bacteriological sabotage activities on land as the most effective methods of using bacteriological weapons.
　　During the trial, many documents were made public, proving the terrible crimes committed by Japanese militarists - preparing for bacteriological warfare. The so-called "Outline for Interrogation of Prisoners of War" was read out in court; it stipulated that prisoners of war included not only soldiers but also peaceful citizens. This document issued by the Japanese Army General Staff Headquarters stated: "In interrogation, the use of torture is sometimes beneficial. At the same time, when carrying out torture, it must not have an adverse effect on us... After the execution, there should be no scars or wounds left." Then, these several "simple" methods of torture were cited: placing a pencil between the fingers and tying the fingertips with a thin rope; having the person being interrogated lie face up (the document suggests raising the legs a little), while dripping water into the nose and mouth drop by drop; placing the person being interrogated on the floor and stomping hard on his outer ankle bone, etc.

　　It was entirely due to the rapid offensive of the Soviet army that prevented the Kwantung Army from using bacteriological weapons.
　　Subsequently, the court interrogation returned to the activities of Unit 731, where "educated" bacteriologists tortured thousands upon thousands of people to death. Yamada testified that in order to test the effectiveness of the bacteriological weapons manufactured by Unit 731, experiments were conducted on living people in the laboratory and in field conditions that were very similar to combat conditions (he learned of these situations from his subordinates). However, the defendant Yamada attempted to mitigate his guilt, he wanted to make the court believe that the people who were brutally abused and murdered in the prison of Unit 731 were those who had already been sentenced to death. However, documents seized by the Soviet army when it defeated the Kwantung Army in Manchuria in 1945 exposed him. The documents read out in court stated that people sent to the prison of Unit 731 by the military police and military organs with the approval of the Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army were killed without trial or investigation, among them were men and women who had not committed any crimes and were simply disliked by the Japanese aggressors.
　　The Soviet Union and its armed forces crushed the Japanese imperialist ruling group's sinister plan to launch bacteriological warfare. After entering Manchuria, the Soviet army inflicted a rapid and sweeping blow on the enemy, crushing the main force of the Japanese army - the Kwantung Army - in the shortest possible time, and thus forcing Japanese imperialism to surrender unconditionally... Yamada then testified: It was entirely due to the rapid offensive of the Soviet army that prevented the Kwantung Army's Unit 731 and Unit 100 from using bacteriological weapons.

　　Trial of the Defendant Toyohiko Nishi
　　In the afternoon, the court interrogated the defendant Toyohiko Nishi. From 1943 to 1945, he served as the captain of the 673rd Detachment of Unit 731. From July 1944, he concurrently served as the director of the so-called training department of Unit 731, guiding the training of personnel in special detachments aimed at conducting bacteriological warfare.
　　Nishi testified that during his tenure as detachment captain, he directly and actively participated in the preparation of bacteriological weapons. Under his guidance, dozens of people raised fleas and engaged in the breeding of rodents. The trial proved that, as Nishi himself admitted, he had trained volunteers, non-commissioned officers, and other personnel participating in Unit 731.
　　Nishi also described the mass production of deadly bacteria and his own participation in forced experiments on living people with shameless nonchalance. Nishi's testimony further revealed the shocking and vicious activities of Unit 731; Engineer Tanaka designed a special cane for sabotage purposes, which was filled with plague-infected fleas; Colonel Ohito manufactured a "chocolate" containing anthrax bacteria for sabotage purposes.
　　Nishi admitted that he was responsible for training bacteriological warfare personnel. The testimony proved that the Japanese invaders had used bacteriological weapons against China and Mongolia.
　　Nishi's testimony proved that the use of bacteriological weapons in China in 1940 had been filmed. Nishi testified: Among the "scientific" films shown in Unit 731, there was a film about experiments on living people in high-altitude chambers. This film was taken from the "experimental" prisoners.
　　The defendant Toyohiko Nishi, who was responsible for guiding the training of bacteriological warfare personnel, then described the experiments on frostbite on living people. They were led out of prison in shackles, with bare hands. To accelerate the freezing, artificial wind was also used. They were also forced to put their frostbitten hands in warm water. The results of this procedure would be "studied" by the personnel of the Unit 731 detachment.
　　Nishi's testimony also proved that Unit 731 had used bacteriological weapons during the Halhin Gol Incident.
　　"In April 1945, when I was transferred from the detachment to the position of director of the training department of Unit 731, I found documents in the safe of my predecessor proving the use of bacteriological weapons in Halhin Gol. Among these documents were photographic negatives and a list of the names of those executed."
　　At this point, the afternoon court adjourned.

　　苏联远东滨海军区军事法庭
　  继续审讯日本细菌战犯
    日本军国主义罪恶阴谋计划完全暴露
    【新华社讯】塔斯社伯力二十七日电：审判前日本军人，罪名是准备和使用细菌武器。
    审讯被告唐泽富雄
    十二月二十六日晨开庭，首先审讯被告唐泽富雄，他是七三一部队生产处的科长。该处处长是被告川岛清。
    唐泽出身医生兼细菌学家，它是大批制造细菌武器的积极组织者之一。在一九四○——一九四二年，被告曾亲身参与以细菌供给华中特别派遣军，以便在作战中使用细菌武器。一九四三——一九四四年，他直接参与以致死的细菌在囚犯身上作罪恶的实验。
    被告曾在七三一部队中服役五年。最初他是一个下级的人员；随后，由于在大批生产细菌武器和屠杀人民方面的“热心”，逐渐擢升到科长的职位。
    被告证实，在七三一部队里，曾在实验室的和野地这两种不同的环境下，对成批活人作大规模的实验。他继供称，在他所领导的科里，共有两套大批生产细菌的设备。每一套都有六个锅炉，制造培养细菌的培养剂。锅炉的总容量是八吨。此外还有其他大批制造细菌武器所需要的设备，包括石井四郎所发明的“孵育器”，这种孵育器以此被称为“石井式孵育器”。唐泽以大批生产的规模制造出来的致死细菌，是被用作对付中国人民的细菌武器，同时也用来在活人身上作实验。
    唐泽供认：大规模以活人（包括美军战俘在内）做细菌实验
    一九四○年九月在宁波实地应用，制造鼠疫传染。
    被告唐泽继供称，一九四四年上半年，七三一部队的设备有颇大一部分被分散到各支队去。这一方面是为了尽量避免因可能的轰炸而使七三一部队的制造能力受损失，另方面是为了加大生产战争的细菌武器的能力。
    为了确定美国军队对各种作战用细菌的感染程度，七三一部队的人员在美军战俘身上研究了对各种传染病的感受程度。
    唐泽答复国家检察官的问题，供称：一九四三年年初，当我在沈阳医院里卧病时，七三一部队的科学工作人员一个姓凑的来看我。他告诉我说：在沈阳，正研究美军战俘对传染疾病的免疫性。
    姓凑的是七三一部队特别派到战俘营研究盎格鲁萨克逊人种对传染性疾病的免疫性的。
    检察官：是否预见到用细菌武器对付美国的远景？
    唐泽：正是这样。预见到这个远景的。
    被告继招供他在安达站亲自参加实验，以确定炭疽热病在交战地点活人身上的活动状况。当时曾用电流使爆裂弹爆炸，以便使绑在柱子上活人受到传染，结果，很大一部分人受到炭疽热病的传染，他们又被带回到第七三一部队的监狱里。他们绝大多数几乎都在那里死掉了。被告也叙述了关于他那一科所培养的鼠疫细菌活动的实验。
    唐泽回答检察官的问题，供认了七三一部队派赴中国本部的特别派遣军的活动，他曾积极参与派遣军的准备工作。一九四○年九月，这支由石井四郎中将医官率领的派遣军到了杭州地区，在宁波城附近实地应用细菌武器。以后不久，宁波就鼠疫流行。唐泽又供称，在一九四二年，也曾有同样的派遣军派到中国本部。
    法庭继续审讯被告山田。
    审讯被告山田乙三
    山田乙三在日本陆军里，曾担任若干很重要的职位。一九三八年年底到一九三九年十月，他是华中日本派遣军（总部设南京）司令。一九三九年十月到一九四四年，他是日本陆军训练总监，同时又是最高军事会议委员，有一个时期还担任过日本防卫总司令官。从一九四四年七月直到向苏军投降时为止，他是关东军司令。
    关东军司令任内，山田亲自监督并通过其部属员监督细菌战争的准备工作。他曾屡次听取七三一、一百号两特种部队的首脑的报告，并曾采取一切措施使这两部队能处于随时能出动作战的状态并能够大规模制造和使用细菌武器。
    山田供认：他直接统辖细菌作战部队，主要是设计用来对付苏联、蒙古和中国。
    山田供称：在他担任关东军总令时，七三一部队和一百号部队受他直接统辖，这两部队的活动极为秘密。在山田就任关东军总令后头几天，就听取了现在坐在罪犯席上的＠冢将军和高桥将军的报告，他们向他作关于七三一部队和一百号部队准备细菌战的工作进展的报告。以后不久，山田亲自前往视察七三一部队，如他所说，当时他为已经制成的跳蛋的数量之巨大和该部队大量制造细菌武器的能力所惊讶。
    被告称：我相信七三一部队的生产能力足以供应在大规模战争中使用细菌武器。
    在答复国家检察官的问题时，山田供认细菌武器主要是设计来对付苏联、蒙古人民共和国和中国；然而也有意用来对付美国和英国。
    山田继而供称：一九四五年三月，关东军司令部收到日本军部关于增加细菌武器的生产的训令。为执行这一命令，他采取了为七三一部队配备专家和增加装备的措施。他并训令一百号部队司令部加强在与苏联接壤地区的细菌侦察。
    检察官向被告山田提出一宗在与苏联接壤地区进行细菌侦察的一百号部队特别组的工作报告的摄影副本。山田供认曾进行此种侦察及类似的侦察，以准备反苏战争。
    在法庭讯问的过程中，被告山田继而供称：关东军曾进行研究利用细菌武器的最有效的方法。由参谋长、军事战略参谋处长、各细菌部队的长官等人组成的特别委员会曾对这些方法加以讨论。关于细菌武器的各种类型以及关于被认为是最有效的使用方法，均曾报告日本陆军参谋长。
    山田在任关东军司令前，即曾参加日本细菌战的准备工作。
    日本军国主义者可怕的罪恶阴谋的计划在审讯过程中愈来愈显著地透露出来。应国家检察官之请，法庭宣读了所谓“对破坏活动组的作战命令”；该项命令系日本陆军参谋长和陆军训练总监于一九四四年一月发布，当时山田任陆军训练总监。这个“命令”中的一节曾提出关于为破坏目的利用细菌武器的方法的指示。
    检察官：被告山田，这个“命令”是由你所统辖的军事训练总监部拟出的吗？山田；是，这些“命令”是由军事训练总监部和参谋部共同拟出的。
    检查官：这是说甚至在你被任命为关东军司令以前，你就参与细菌战的准备？山田：是，是这样的。
    山田继而供称：他个人赞成石井式炸弹，从飞机上喷射细菌以及在陆地上进行细菌破坏活动，是使用细菌武器的最有效方法。
    在审讯过程中，公布了许多文件，这些文件证明了日本军国主义者犯下可怖的罪恶——准备细菌战争。在法庭上宣读了所谓“战俘审讯纲要”；其中规定战俘中不仅有军人，而且有和平公民，。日本陆军参谋总部发布的这一文件声称：“在审讯中，使用酷刑有时是有好处的。同时，实行酷刑时必须不发生对我们不利的影响……。在行刑后，要不留伤痕或创疤。”随即举出了酷刑的这几种“简单”方法：把铅笔放在手指中间，用细绳把指尖捆住；让受审的人仰天躺下（文件中建议把腿抬高一些），同时把水一滴一滴地倒进鼻子和口腔里；把受审的人放在地板上，猛踏他的外脚踝骨等等。
    完全因为苏联军队迅速攻势才阻止关东军使用细菌武器
    继而，法庭审讯又返回到七三一部队的活动上，在这个部队中，“有学识的”细菌学家把成千成千的人栲打至死。山田供称，为了试验七三一部队所制造的细菌武器的效能，就在实验室与极近似作战状况的野地的状况（他从他的下级方面得知这些情形）下，对活人进行实验。然而，被告山田企图减轻他的罪状，他想使法庭相信在七三一部队的监狱中残酷地被虐杀的人，是已被判处死刑者。然而苏军在一九四五年在满洲击溃关东军时缴获的文件揭穿了他。在法庭宣读的文件说明，在关东军总司令的认可之下，由宪兵队和军事机关送往七三一部队监狱的人是未经审讯和调查而被害死的，其中是些没有犯过任何罪行而只是不为日本侵略者所喜的男子和妇女。
    苏联及其武装部队粉碎了日本帝国主义者统治集团要发动细菌战争的罪恶的计划，苏军在进入满洲后，对敌人加以迅速的横扫一切的打击，在最短时间内粉碎了日本的主力——关东军，并因而迫使日本帝国主义无条件投降……。山田继而供称：完全是因为苏联军队的迅速的攻势，才阻止了关东军七三一部队和一百号部队的使用细菌武器。
    审讯被告西丰彦
    下午庭审讯被告西丰彦。自一九四三至一九四五年，他担任七三一部队六七三支队队长。自一九四四年七月，他兼任七三一部队的所谓教练处处长，指导旨在用以进行细菌战的特别分队人员的训练事宜。
    西丰彦供认，他在任支队长时曾直接地积极地参与准备细菌武器的工作。在他的指导之下，有数十个人饲养跳蚤，从事繁殖啮齿类动物。审讯证明：正如西丰彦本人所供认不讳的，他曾经训练志愿兵、士官、及参加七三一部队的其他人员。
    西丰彦并又以无耻的满不在乎的态度叙述了大量制造致死细菌以及他本人参与对活人强制实验的情形。西丰彦的供词进一步揭露了七三一部队惊人的凶恶活动；田中工程师设计了一种作为破坏之用的特种手杖，这种手杖中装着染有鼠疫的跳蚤；大户大佐制造了一种“巧克力”，其中含有炭疽热病细菌，作为破坏之用。
    西丰彦供认曾负责训练细菌战人员。供词证明：日寇曾对中国和蒙古使用过细菌武器。
    西丰彦的供词证明：一九四○年在中国使用细菌武器的情形已摄成影片。西丰彦供称：七三一部队里所放演的“科学”影片中，有一个影片是关于对高空室里的活人所作的实验。这个影片是从“受实验”的犯人们所照出来的。
    曾负责指导细菌战人员训练事宜的被告西丰彦，继即叙述关于以活人实验冻伤的情形。他们带着脚镣手铐被领出监狱，光着双手。为了加速使冰冷到极点，还使用人造风。他们又被迫把他们冻伤的双手放在温水中。这种程序的结果将由七三一部队支队的人员们加以“研究”。
    西丰彦的供状并证明了七三一部队曾于哈尔新——葛尔事变期间，使用细菌武器。
    “在一九四五年四月间，当我自支队调任七三一部队教练处处长之职时，我在我的前任者的保险柜中发现了证明在哈尔新——葛尔使用细菌武器的文件。在这些文件中，有照片的底版和被处死的人名册。”
    至此，下午庭宣告结束。
