　　Premier Chen Yun
  　Report on the Issues of Commodity Prices and Issuing Public Bonds
    (At the Fourth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2, 1949)
    The currency devaluation and price increases that began in mid-October have caused great losses to the people of the whole country, especially to the millions of the People's Liberation Army and the working people across the country who depend on wages for a living.
    The main reason for this currency devaluation and price increases is the government's huge fiscal deficit, and the resulting excessive issuance of banknotes.
    On the mainland, the People's Liberation Army has routed the Kuomintang remnants, and vast areas have been liberated. On the one hand, this is very exciting. However, with this victory comes a significant increase in government spending. The number of military, government, and teaching personnel has exceeded seven million, and it is estimated that it will increase next year. However, this year's fiscal revenue far cannot meet the needs of expenditure. The old liberated areas, which have experienced long-term wars, are still supporting the front lines and newly liberated cities with large quantities of grain and materials. In the newly liberated areas, only some places have begun to collect public grain. Also, because the newly liberated areas have ended the war not long ago, bandits still need to be suppressed, railways are not easy to repair, and urban-rural exchange needs to go through a recovery process, the tax revenue of the cities is also very low. This makes the government's fiscal expenditure and revenue greatly inconsistent. In order to make up for the deficit, we have to temporarily rely on issuing banknotes. This is the root cause of the currency devaluation and price increases.
    It should be said that the financial and economic leaders also have shortcomings in their work due to lack of experience. For example: even if price increases are difficult to avoid, we should try our best to make them rise gradually, and avoid soaring in a few days. The grain storage and transportation in the Beijing-Tianjin area should be increased to prevent speculative merchants from making trouble, and to avoid the panic of the citizens about food in those few days.
    There is only one month left this year, and 1950 is coming soon. How will the government's revenue and expenditure be by the end of next year? Can it be better than this year? This is a matter of concern to everyone. The Finance and Economics Committee has put forward a draft of "The General Budget Estimate of Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure for 1950," which Comrade Bo Yibo will explain. Because many places were only liberated not long ago, and many areas are waiting to be liberated, we are still in a state of war. Therefore, there will definitely be some changes in the expenditures and revenues listed in the estimate in the future. But in general, the government's financial situation next year will be like this: the situation will definitely be much better than this year, but the deficit will still be very large. The question before us is: Should we continue to rely solely on increasing currency issuance to make up for the deficit? Or should we look for other better solutions?
    Now the people of the whole country are elated by the victory of the People's Liberation Army, and they also understand the financial difficulties of the People's Government in the Liberation War. But they also hope that even in difficulties, the government will try to make the financial and price situation relatively stable. This hope is very understandable. Because the people have suffered more than ten years of inflation under the rule of Japanese invaders, traitors, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Considering this hope of the people, therefore, in the government's financial measures, we cannot rely solely on increasing currency issuance, but should look for solutions in other aspects. To this end, the government is working hard to consolidate tax revenue, increase income, and has decided to carry out savings and production in government agencies and troops. Under the policy of saving and production, the treatment of military, government and teaching personnel, who are already very poor, cannot be improved; the personnel of troops, organs and schools in the rear should carry out production as much as possible to provide for part of their own grain and vegetables; troops without direct combat missions should, where possible, engage in agricultural and industrial production; all possible expenditures should be saved. However, all of these cannot greatly reduce the government's financial burden. Moreover, self-sufficiency in production cannot take effect immediately. To this end, a proposal is submitted to the Central People's Government Committee: to request the Central People's Government to issue a public bond. The purchase and repayment of this public bond will be calculated at real value. Within five years, the purchasers are guaranteed to receive reliable principal and interest in installments. Also considering the current national economic situation and the difficulties of the people, the amount of public bonds is only set at 200 million shares. The role of this public bond is to make up for part of the fiscal deficit. It is a burden for the people to purchase public bonds in the case of national economic difficulties. However, this burden is better than the losses suffered due to currency devaluation resulting from the increased issuance of banknotes. Because the result of the currency devaluation is that the devaluation part of the currency value is completely lost. Buying a public bond is a burden at the moment, but it can be repaid with principal and interest after all, which is not a loss. If the issuance of public bonds reduces the deficit, making the currency value and price situation next year better than this year, it will not only benefit the working people who live on wages throughout the country, and military, government and teaching personnel; but also be beneficial to the normal operation of industry and commerce. Therefore, from the perspective of the interests of all the people, issuing public bonds is better than issuing more banknotes.
    It must also be reported to the government committee: even if the public bonds are issued to reduce the fiscal deficit next year, the fiscal situation next year will still be difficult. Because the issuance of public bonds has not eliminated the deficit. And the amount of the deficit is still not small. Especially because the victory of the Liberation War is progressing rapidly, the increase in military and political personnel in the newly liberated areas is also very rapid, and the expenditure will increase rapidly and substantially. However, the fiscal revenue in the newly liberated areas will increase slowly and gradually. Generally speaking: it takes a long process of work for the newly liberated areas to become old liberated areas; the fiscal work in the newly liberated areas is also the same, and there are many difficulties in making the fiscal revenue on the right track and achieving the hope listed in the 1950 budget estimate. Especially because many of our financial and economic leaders still lack experience.
    All the government's fiscal difficulties this year and next year will inevitably become the difficulties and burdens of the people. However, this difficulty is a difficulty in victory; this burden is a burden of victory. Only after the liberation of the whole country, the complete elimination of the Kuomintang reactionary army, and the end of the war can this burden begin to be relieved. The victory of liberating the whole country is not far away. After the liberation of the whole country, although we will still have many difficulties at that time, and we will still need to go through a difficult process of economic construction, that belongs to another kind of difficulty. At that time, the economic and financial situation of our country will inevitably be better year by year.

### 陈云总理　对于物价问题与发行公债的报告

　　陈云总理
  　对于物价问题与发行公债的报告
    （一九四九年十二月二日中央人民政府委员会第四次会议上）
    这次从十月中旬开始的币价下跌和物价上涨，对于全国人民的损失，是很大的。尤其是对几百万解放军和全国依靠工资生活的劳动人民。
    这次币价下跌，物价上涨的主要原因，是政府的财政赤字庞大，因此而来的钞票发行过多。
    在大陆上，人民解放军把国民党残匪打得鸡飞狗散，广大地区已经获得解放。这一方面，是令人非常兴奋的。但是，随着这个胜利而来的，是政府财政支出大大增加。军政公教人员已经超过了七百万，估计明年还会增加。但是在今年的财政收入方面，远赶不上支出的需要。经过长期战争的老解放区，直到今天还在以很大数量的粮食、物资支援前线和新解放城市。在新解放区仅仅有一部分地方，开始征收公粮。也因为新解放区结束战争不久，土匪尚待肃清，铁路修复不易，城乡交流需要经过一个恢复过程，所以城市的税收，也是很少的。这样，就使政府的财政支出与收入之间，大大不相符。为了弥补赤字，暂时不能不依靠发行钞票。这是币价下跌，物价大涨的根本原因。
    应该说，财经主管人员，因为经验不足，工作中也有缺点的。例如：即使物价上涨是难于避免的，但应该尽力使其逐渐上升，而要避免在几天之内飞涨。京、津一带的粮食储运，应该增加，使投机奸商无从捣乱，而免得市民在那几天中对粮食的恐惶不安。
    今年只有一个月了，一九五○年快要到来。明年底政府的收支情况如何？能否比今年好些？这是大家关心的问题。财委会已提出了一个“一九五○年度的财政收支概算”的草案，薄一波同志对此将有说明。因为许多地方在不久以前才解放，许多地区正待解放，我们还处在战争中，因此，概算所列的支出与收入，将来事实上定有若干变动。但大体说来，明年度政府的财政情况将是这样：情况一定比今年好得多，但赤字仍旧很大。放在我们面前的问题是：继续单一地依靠增加发钞来弥补赤字呢？还是找找别的较好的出路？
    现在全国人民，对于解放军的胜利，欢欣鼓舞，也理解到人民政府在解放战争中财政方面的困难。但是他们又这样盼望着：希望政府即使在困难中，也要设法使金融物价比较地稳定些。这种希望是很可理解的。因为人民在日寇、汉奸、国民党反动统治之下，经过了十多年通货膨胀的痛苦。考虑到人民这种希望，因此，在政府的财政措施上，不能单一依靠增发通货，应该在别的方面，找找出路。为此，政府正在努力整理税收，增加收入，并且决定在政府机关和部队中进行节约、生产。在节约和生产的方针下，已经很苦的军政公教人员的待遇，还不能提高；后方的部队机关学校人员，应该尽可能进行生产，以自给一部分粮食和菜蔬；没有直接战斗任务的部队，在可能条件下，进行农、工业生产；一切可能节省的支出，统统加以节省。但是，所有这些，还不能大量减轻政府的财政负担。而且生产自给也不能立即生效。为此，向中央人民政府委员会提出了一个提案：提请中央人民政府发行一次公债。这种公债的购买与付还，都以折实计算。五年之内，保证承购人分期得到可靠的本息。也估计到目前全国经济情况和人民的困难，公债的数量只定二万万分。这种公债的作用，在于弥补财政赤字的一部分由人民购买公债，在全国经济困难情况下，也是一种负担。但是这种负担，比起因增发钞票，币价下跌所受的损失说来，是比较好的。因为币价下跌的结果，其下跌部分的币值，是全部损失了的，购买了的公债，在一时算来是负担，但是究竟可以还本得息，不是一种损失。如果发行公债缩小赤字的结果，使明年的币值与物价情况比今年改善，则非但对全国工资生活的劳动人民，和军政公教人员有好处；而且，对于工商业的正常经营，也是有益的。所以从全体人民的利益说来，发行公债比之多发钞票要好些。
    还须向政府委员会报告：即使发行了公债，缩小了明年财政赤字之后，明年的财政情况，仍是困难的。因为发了公债之后，并未消灭赤字。并且赤字的数目，仍旧不小。尤其因为解放战争的胜利，进展很快，新解放地区的军政人员的增加，也很快，支出方面会迅速大量增加。但新解放地区的财政收入，则是缓慢与逐渐增加的。一般地说：新解放区从解放开始变成老解放区，需要一个不短的工作过程；新解放区的财政工作，也是这样，在那里要使财政收入上轨道，达到一九五○年度概算所列的希望，是有许多困难的。尤其因为我们许多财经主管人员，还缺少经验。
    所有今年的和明年的政府财政困难，其结果都必然成为人民的困难和负担。但是，这个困难是胜利中的困难；这个负担，是胜利的负担。只有解放了全国，全部肃清国民党反动军队，结束了战争之后，这个负担才能开始解放。解放全国的胜利，是已经不远了。全国解放之后，虽然我们那时仍有很多困难，那时我们还需经过一个经济建设的艰难过程，但那是属于另一种困难。那时，我们国家的经济和财政情况，将必然一年胜过一年。
