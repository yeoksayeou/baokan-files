　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 1st: The mutinous troops in Batangas Province, southern Luzon, Philippines, are still persisting in fighting despite the joint offensive by the Quirino government's naval, land, and air forces. According to a report from Agence France-Presse, Police Deputy Commander Colonel Toralba on November 28th, "made the first practical assessment of the Batangas battle: 1,000 (officially originally claimed only 300) rebels are holding out in the mountains south and east of Batangas City." According to a Reuters dispatch on November 27th: A part of the mutinous troops in Batangas "has successfully broken through the cordon and entered Quezon Province in southern Luzon." After the Quirino government's military offensive suffered setbacks, it is now adopting a "political offensive," using airplanes to distribute a large number of so-called "surrender" leaflets to the mutinous troops. At the same time, the behind-the-scenes commander of the Quirino government—U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, Cowen, and the head of the U.S. military advisory group, Anderson—expressed unease about the current situation in the Philippines. On the evening of the 29th, they held a meeting with Quirino, Philippine Interior Minister Baluyot, Army Chief of Staff Castañeda, and Police Commander Brigadier General Ramos to discuss the Philippines' "internal security issues."

　　起义部队坚持作战菲政府军进攻受挫
    【新华社北京一日电】菲律宾吕宋南部八打雁省的哗变部队，虽在季里诺政府海、陆、空军的联合进攻下，仍在坚持作战。据法新社电称，菲警备队副司令托拉尔巴上校于十一月二十八日“对八打雁战事作了首次实际的估计：一千名（官方原来宣称仅有三百名）叛军正坚守在八打雁城以南与以东的山岳中”。另据路透社十一月二十七日电称：八打雁的哗变部队一部“已胜利突破警戒线，进入吕宋南部的奎松省”。季里诺政府在军事进攻受挫后，现正采取“政治攻势”，用飞机向哗变部队大量散发所谓“劝降”传单。同时，季里诺政府的幕后指挥者——美国驻菲大使柯温与美国军事顾问团团长安德逊，对菲律宾现在的情势表示不安。他们于二十九日晚与季里诺、菲内长巴鲁约特、陆军参谋长卡斯塔尼达、警备队总司令拉莫斯准将，举行会议商讨菲律宾的“国内安全问题”。
