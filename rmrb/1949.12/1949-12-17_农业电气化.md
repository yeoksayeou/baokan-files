　　Agricultural Electrification
    During the years of the Stalin Five-Year Plans before the war, Soviet agriculture became "the world's largest mechanized and technologically armed production in the form of a complete system of collective farms and state farms" (Stalin's words). The party of Lenin-Stalin and the Soviet government continued to arm agricultural production with the most advanced and perfect technology. At the same time, special attention was also paid to agricultural electrification, to the widespread application of technologies based on the use of electricity.
    The significance of this measure cannot be overemphasized. Agricultural electrification assumes the most important role in completing our country's transition from socialism to communism, in creating abundant agricultural products, in accelerating the convergence of agricultural and industrial labor, and in advancing the countryside to the level of cities in terms of production and culture.
    Lenin said: "Communism—that is, Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country." The Lenin plan of the Russian Electrification Commission paid attention to using electricity to develop industry first. Lenin believed that rural electrification could be realized when a powerful socialist industry was established in the country and agriculture became a huge collective agricultural production. The Bolshevik Party led by the great Stalin realized these predictions of Lenin.
    After the realization of agricultural collectivization and the victory of the collective farm system, agricultural electrification gained widespread popularity. In 1940, 10,000 collective farms and 2,500 agricultural machine stations used electricity. During the war, most rural power stations were destroyed. In February 1945, Comrade Stalin signed the resolution of the Soviet Council of People's Commissars "On the Development of Rural Electrification." This resolution formulated a broad plan for the construction of small hydroelectric power stations. Within one year after the promulgation of this resolution, 601 rural hydroelectric power stations were built, electrifying approximately 2,500 collective farms and 679 agricultural machine repair shops. By the beginning of 1946, the power generation equipment in rural areas had reached the pre-war level, and by the beginning of 1948, it had exceeded the pre-war level by two times. Last year, more than 2,500 farm power stations were completed, and another 6,000 collective farms gained access to electricity. Approximately 15,000 generators have been installed in collective farms and state farms, with a total of 60,000.
    Many provinces and districts in the Soviet Union have been universally electrified. As early as 1947, the entire Sverdlovsk Province was electrified. The province electrified 2,083 collective farms, 84 agricultural machine stations, and 10 state farms; 138,000 residences, 2,000 rural schools, 600 hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, approximately 1,000 clubs and rural reading rooms, 9,000 livestock farms, and approximately 2,000 collective farm blacksmith shops and workshops had electric lights. Currently, in the villages of this province, there are approximately 500 sound film venues and hundreds of radio relay stations. There are 170 hydroelectric power stations and 621 thermal power stations in the province; the power of rural power stations has reached 45,000 kilowatts, exceeding the power of all rural power stations in Tsarist Russia by 22 and a half times.
    Moscow Province has also achieved great victories. Here, universal electrification has been implemented, with more than 4,862 collective farms electrified. In all other provinces and republics, the electrification plan is also being successfully completed. For example, in Belarus, thousands of villages and towns have gained access to electricity, while in Armenia, 400 collective farms and more than 50 state farms and agricultural machine stations have gained access to electricity.
    According to the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan, by the end of 1950, the power of rural power stations must be increased to 2 million kilowatts; it will be guaranteed that all state farms, agricultural machine stations, agricultural machine repair shops, and 56,000 collective farms will have access to electricity. The main source of rural electricity will be hydroelectric power stations working on the basis of the country's richest water resources. In places without water power, rural thermal power stations will be built using local fuel and agricultural production waste. It is also planned to widely utilize wind power.
    Currently, electricity is being used in 60 ways, giving brilliant practical savings effects. Last year, more than 10,000 electric threshing grounds were working in collective farms and state farms, thereby saving huge amounts of liquid fuel, freeing up thousands of tractors for other work, and greatly reducing grain losses during threshing. Electricity is being used particularly extensively in washing, sifting, drying, and milling grains; as is the case in irrigating fields, orchards, and vegetable gardens.
    Electric tractors can often be seen in the fields of collective farms. The newly designed electric tractor that appeared in the fields of the Medynsky District of Moscow Province not long ago can be used for plowing, sowing, irrigating, and milling grain. These tractors can exceed the productivity of all tractors by more than two times.
    The use of electricity in animal husbandry has very significant implications. Electrified and mechanized feed rooms have been created to prepare feed for livestock; electric power is used to supply water to livestock sheds. This saves labor, frees up the strength of workers, and increases milk yields. In the collective farms of the Ramensky District of Moscow Province, when water was supplied non-mechanically, it took three to four people every day to supply water for every 100 cows. After installing an automatic electric water supply tower with an automatic water intake machine, the same number of livestock can be cared for by only one person. In the collective farms of the Ramensky District, the electrification of feed preparation has given the possibility of reducing the staff of the feed room by three to four times. Experience shows that electric milking can increase labor productivity by 40 percent, and electric shearing of sheep can increase labor productivity by 50 percent. Electrified milk separators can increase labor productivity by three times.
    The completion of the Five-Year Plan in the electrification of agricultural production will allow saving 150 million individual labor days, 20 million tractor hours, and 8,000 horse labor days. The fuel saved will be: 340,000 tons of petroleum, 300,000 tons of other petroleum products, 13,000 tons of lubricating oil, and 1.3 million tons of firewood. Due to reduced losses, an additional 430,000 tons of grain and 1.3 million kilograms of wool can be obtained.
    The electrification of Soviet agriculture is being carried out on a scientific basis. The Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences pays particular attention to this issue. The All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Agricultural Electrification and its many provincial branches have been established under the Academy. The Institute is studying the technological and organizational principles of building electric agricultural machine stations (these machine stations are a further development of modern agricultural machine stations); and is studying the methods of rationally utilizing small rivers, irrigation systems, reservoirs, and other water sources.
    The countryside and the city, collective farmers, workers, and scholars—that is, the entire country moving towards communism, are participating in solving the problem of agricultural electrification.

　　农业电气化
    在战前斯大林五年计划的年代里，苏联的农业变成了“在集体农庄和国营农场完整制度形式下，世界上最庞大的机械化的和以新技术武装起来的生产”（斯大林语）。列宁——斯大林的党和苏联政府继续以最先进的和最完善的技术武装着农业生产。同时，对农业电气化，对基于使用电力的技术的广泛应用，亦给予特别的注意。
    不能不充分评价这一措施的意义。农业电气化在完成我国从社会主义过渡到共产主义的时期，在创造丰足的农产品上，在加速农业和工业劳动的接近上，在生产和文化方面使乡村进到城市水平上，均负起最重要作用的使命。
    列宁说：“共产主义——这就是苏维埃政权加上全国电气化”。俄国电气化委员会的列宁计划曾注意首先利用电力以发展工业。列宁认为：当在国家建立了强大的社会主义工业，而农业变为庞大的集体农业生产的时候，就可以实现农村电气化。伟大斯大林所领导的布尔什维克党实现了列宁的这些预言。
    在实现农业集体化和集体农庄制度胜利以后，农业电气化便获得广泛的普及。一九四○年已有一万个集体农庄和二千五百个农业机器站使用电力。在战时，大部分农村发电站被破坏了。一九四五年二月间，斯大林同志签署了苏联人民委员会“关于发展农村电气化”的决议。此项决议制定了建设小水力发电站的广大计划。在此项决议颁布后一年内，建设了六百○一个农村水力发电站，电气化了约二千五百个集体农庄和六百七十九个农业机器修理厂。至一九四六年初，农村的发电设备已达到战前水平，而至一九四八年初，则超过战前水平两倍。去年，建设竣工的有两千五百多个农庄发电站，又有六千个集体农庄获得电力。在各集体农庄和国营农场中安置了约一万五千个发电机，而总共计有六万个。
    苏联的很多省份的区已普遍的电气化了。早在一九四七年的时候，斯维尔德洛夫省全区就都电气化了。本省电气化了的有两千○八十三个集体农庄，八十四个农业机器站，十个国营农场；十三万八千座住宅、两千所农村学校、六百个医院、诊疗所和药铺、约一千个俱乐部和农村阅读室、九千个牲畜场、约二千个集体农庄的铁匠铺及作坊有了电灯。现在，在该省各村庄中，约有五百个有声电影场和数百个无线电转播站。在该省内计有一百七十个水力发电站，和六百二十一个热力发电站；农村发电站的威力已达四万五千基罗瓦特，超过了沙皇俄国所有农村发电站的威力二十二倍半。
    莫斯科省亦达到了巨大的胜利。在这儿，业已实行普遍地电气化，已电气化的有四千八百六十二个以上的集体农庄。在一切其它省份和共和国内，也都顺利地完成着电气化的计划。例如，在别洛露西亚已有数千个村庄和村镇获得了电力，在阿尔明尼亚则有四百个集体农庄和五十多个国营农场及农业机器站获得了电力。
    根据战后斯大林五年计划，至一九五○年终结时，农村发电站的威力必须提高到二百万基罗瓦特；将要保证所有的国营农场、农业机器站、农业机器修理厂以及五万六千个集体农庄获得电力使用。农村电力主要来源，将是在国家最丰富的水源基础上工作的水力发电站。在没有水力的地方，将修建以当地之燃料和农业生产废物发电的农村热力发电站。并还计划广泛地利用风力。
    现今，在用六十种方法利用着电力，而给予辉煌的实际的节约的效果。去年，在各集体农庄和国营农场中，曾有一万多个电气打谷场工作，由于如此，节约了巨量液体燃料，为其它的工作腾出了数千架拖拉机，并大大减少了在打谷当中谷物的损失。在洗清、筛、干燥和碾谷物中均特别广泛地利用着电力；在灌溉田地、果园和菜园上亦是如此。
    在各集体农庄的田野里，时常可以看到电气拖拉机。不久前，在莫斯科省梅吉申斯基区田野里出现之新设计的电气拖拉机，可以用于耕种、播种、灌溉以及碾谷。这些拖拉机可以超过所有拖拉机生产力两倍之多。
    在畜牧业中使用电力具有着非常重大的意义。为给牲畜准备饲料而创造了电气化和机械化的饲料房；借电气之助来供给牲畜棚的用水。这节省了劳动，腾出了工人的力量，提高了生产的榨乳量。在莫斯科省拉敏斯克区各集体农庄中，在非机械化给水的时候，为供给每一百头牛的水用，每天需要三个——四个人。在装置了带自动吸水机的自动电气给水塔以后，同样数量的牲口仅用一个人照料就够了。在拉敏斯克区各集体农庄中，准备饲料之电气化给了减少饲料房的工作人员三倍至四倍的可能性。据经验表明，电气榨乳可提高劳动生产率百分之四十，用电力剪羊毛则可提高劳动生产率百分之五十。电气化的牛奶分离器可提高劳动生产率三倍。
    在农业生产的电气化方面，五年计划之完成将允许节约一万万五千万个人的劳动日，二千万拖拉机小时和八千个马的劳动日。节约的燃料为：石油三十四万吨，其它各种石油产品三十万吨、滑机油一万三千吨、木柴一百三十万吨。由于减少损失将可补充获得谷物四十三万吨，羊毛一百三十万公斤。
    苏联的农业电气化是在科学的基础上进行的。苏联列宁农业科学院对这一问题给予特别大的注意。在该科学院属下建立了全苏农业电气化科学研究所及其各省的许多分所。该研究所正在研究建设电气农业机器站（这些机器站是现代农业机器站的进一步发展）的技术与组织的原则；并在研究合理利用小河、灌溉体系、贮水池以及其它水源的方法。
    乡村和城市，集体农庄庄员、工人和学者们——即正在向着共产主义前进中的整个国家，都在参加解决农业电气化的课题。
