Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th—The Asian Women's Delegate Conference successfully concluded today at 8 PM. The conference passed the following five declarations and resolutions: Letter to Women Sisters of Asian Countries, Letter to Women of the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands, Resolution on Striving for Women's Rights, Resolution on the Activities of the International Democratic Women's Federation in Assisting Women's Groups in Asian Countries, and Resolution on the Situation of Children in Asian Countries.

As each declaration and resolution was passed, delegates and guests from various countries stood up and applauded enthusiastically, shouting slogans. These declarations and resolutions unanimously pointed out that only by overthrowing imperialism and establishing people's democratic regimes can women's rights and children's rights be truly guaranteed. The worldwide women's liberation movement is inseparable from the struggles of various countries for national independence, people's democracy, and lasting world peace. Therefore, women in Asian countries and women's groups in various countries should strengthen the struggle for national independence, people's democracy, and the defense of lasting world peace.

Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government personally attended the conference today. After accepting the presentation of flags and gifts from the Korean, French, and Chinese delegations, Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a brief speech. Vice Chairman Zhu said: The liberation of Chinese women is the result of the victory of the Chinese people's liberation war. The Chinese people achieved this victory not only because of their own persistent struggle, but also because of the common struggle of the people of the world, and because Stalin and the Soviet people gave us a great and successful example. The experience of the Chinese people's revolution and the women's movement proves that the liberation movement of women in oppressed nations is inseparable from the national liberation movement. Only when the entire nation is liberated can women obtain freedom.
