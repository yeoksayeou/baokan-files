　　After a Year of Arduous Repairs
  　Harbin Sugar Factory Starts Production
  　Initial Trial Yields 47 Tons of Sugar Per Day
    [Our Newspaper] Harbin Sugar Factory, one of the four major sugar factories in Northeast China, has been repaired for a year since last November. It started producing sugar on December 13, half a month ahead of schedule. The first day's trial resulted in 47 tons of sugar. The quality of the test results is good.
    The factory's repair work has absorbed the advanced scientific experience of the Soviet Union, so the internal mechanical installation, electrical, and safety equipment are relatively standardized. It also has a relatively complete laboratory. The entire production process is mechanized. During the repair process, employees and technicians demonstrated a high degree of ownership and labor enthusiasm. For example, Xu Zhiren, an old worker in the repair department, his son died in an accident at the Acheng farm tool factory during the resumption of work. He went to see him and quickly returned. He said, "People's hearts are made of flesh, and it's hard to bear, but I always think about the resumption of work in the factory, so I hurried back." During the resumption of work, staff braved heavy rain and unloaded trains without eating. During the week of preparation for start-up, many workshop directors who could not leave their posts often watched the machines day and night without sleeping. More importantly, technical personnel and workers combined. During the resumption of work, technical personnel proposed the slogan of going deep into the masses and went to various groups to help. The factory is located on the bank of the Songhua River, which provides very important clean river water for sugar production. In addition, the soil in Jiangbei is more suitable for planting sugar beet raw materials, which is also convenient for purchasing and transportation. In connecting urban and rural relations, not only can farmers provide industrial raw materials, but also the factory's by-products include sugar beet pulp and waste molasses. Sugar beet pulp can provide good feed for farmers and livestock farms. Waste molasses can be used to make industrial raw materials such as alcohol. After the factory starts production, it is studying sugar quality, moisture, dryness, granulation, and taste to continue to improve it.

　　经过一年艰苦修复
  　哈尔滨糖厂开工出糖
  　首次试验日产糖四十七吨
    【本报讯】东北四大糖厂之一的哈尔滨糖厂，自去年十一月到现在，经过一年的修复，于十二月十三日已提前半月糖了。第一日试验结果，即出四十七吨糖。化验结果质量较好。
    该厂修复工作由于吸收了苏联先进科学经验，所以内部机械安装，电气、安全设备都比较正规。并设有比较完整的化验室。生产过程全部为机械化。在修复过程中，职工和技术人员，都发挥了高度主人翁劳动热情。如修理部徐志仁老工友，在复工期中，他儿子在阿城农具工厂因公伤亡，他去看了一下很快就回来了，他说：“人心都是肉长的，是难受，可是心里总惦念厂子复工的事，就忙着回来了。”职员在复工中，曾冒着大雨不吃饭卸火车。在准备开工的一周中，许多离开不了岗位的工长，常常日日夜夜不睡觉看着机器。更重要的是技术人员和工人结合，在复工中，技术人员提出深入群众的口号，都到各小组去进行帮助。该厂位于松花江畔，有供应制糖很主要的洁净江水。另外江北一带土坏更适合种植甜菜原料，又便利于收购运输。在沟通城乡关系上，不但农民可供给工业原料，同时该厂副产物有甜菜渣及废蜜，甜菜渣子可供给农民及畜牧场家畜良好饲料。废蜜可制工业原料酒精精等。该厂开工后，正在研究糖质水分、干燥、粒状、味道等，使之继续提高。
