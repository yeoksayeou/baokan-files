Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 5th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Lieutenant Colonel Grippov published an article in the Red Star newspaper on the 3rd, commenting on the victorious advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In discussing the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in liberating Chongqing, Lieutenant Colonel Grippov pointed out: The liberation of Chongqing, a major political, commercial, and cultural center in southwestern China, by the People's Liberation Army once again proves that the armed forces of New China are victoriously and rapidly liberating the entire territory of the People's Republic of China. The Kuomintang reactionaries, under the orders of their American guardians, had intended to settle in Chongqing after fleeing Guangzhou, planning to use it as their political and administrative center, but due to the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, this plan quickly turned into a bubble. The Kuomintang leaders not long ago even said that they would use the southwestern provinces as a bridgehead for launching a "decisive counter-offensive." The fact that the People's Liberation Army liberated Guiyang, Guilin, and Chongqing refutes the shameless lies of these Kuomintang leaders. Lieutenant Colonel Grippov pointed out: The Kuomintang leaders, feeling the volcano erupting beneath their feet and seeing the land they can still control shrinking day by day, are openly demanding that international reactionary forces interfere in China's civil war. Spokesmen for the American imperialist bloc, such as Chennault, are currently displaying unusual enthusiasm, seeking ways to aid the defeated Kuomintang. But no matter what castles in the air the completely bankrupt Kuomintang "strategists" build, no matter how many representatives of American reactionary forces, such as Chennault, run around, they cannot reverse the wheel of history. The day when the flag of the People's Republic of China flies over the entire territory of China is drawing ever closer.

　　全中国解放日益迫近
  　红星报发表葛里波夫中校论文
    赞扬中国人民解放军胜利前进
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：葛里波夫中校于三日在红星报撰文评论中国人民解放军的胜利前进。葛里波夫中校在论及人民解放军解放重庆的伟大胜利时指出：中国人民解放军解放中国西南部主要政治、商业、文化中心的重庆，再度证明了新中国的武装力量正在胜利地以最快的速度解放中华人民共和国全境的任务。国民党反动集团在其美国监护人命令下，于逃出广州后，曾经在重庆住下来，打算把重庆作为其政治与行政中心，但由于人民解放军的英勇善战，这个计划很快地就化为泡影了。国民党的头子们不久以前还说他们要利用西南各省地区作为发动“决定性反攻”的桥头堡垒。人民解放军解放贵阳、桂林及重庆的事实，驳斥了国民党头子们这种厚颜无耻的漫天大谎。葛里波夫中校指出：国民党头子们感觉着他们脚下的火山要爆发，并看到他们尚能控制的土地正在日益缩小，于是公然要求国际反动势力干涉中国内战。美国帝国主义集团的发言人如陈纳德，目前正在表现异常的热情，希图找到援助溃败的国民党的方法。但不论完全破产的国民党“战略家们”建造什么样的空中楼阁，不论有多少的美国反动势力代表们如陈纳德到处奔走，他们都不能扭转历史的巨轮。中华人民共和国国旗飘扬在中国全境上空的时候，已日益迫近了。
