Notice from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council
Regarding the Handling of Original Year-End Double Pay or Bonus Issues for Certain Public Enterprises

To: The Financial and Economic Management Departments of the Major Administrative Regions and Provincial and Municipal People's Governments, and the Management Organs of Various Public Enterprises:

It is now mid-December, and the end of 1949 is approaching. Some public enterprises originally had the treatment of paying year-end double pay or year-end bonuses due to the long-term struggles of workers during the Kuomintang era. This is the fruit of workers' long-term struggles, and we should recognize it and are unwilling to abolish it. However, only a portion of enterprises have this double pay or bonus, while another portion does not. The double pay or bonus among enterprises is also inconsistent, with some enterprises having very little and others having a lot, even up to four or five months' wages. Under the current situation of the victorious development of the Liberation War, the larger the liberated areas, the greater the state's expenditures on military and administrative affairs. The newly recovered areas have very limited tax revenues due to the destruction by the Kuomintang reactionary troops. Moreover, the war has not yet ended. In order to win the final victory, liberate the Southwest, and liberate Taiwan, it is temporarily impossible to reduce the army, and the state still needs to spend huge military expenses. In addition, various industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises destroyed by the Chiang bandits urgently need to be restored, which also requires the state to spend a lot of funds. Therefore, the government's financial revenue and expenditure are in deficit, and it is very difficult. If year-end salaries of several months are universally issued to employees as before, the state's financial expenditure will greatly increase, and it will be forced to issue more currency, which may cause another round of price fluctuations. This will not only affect the lives of employees themselves, but also cause significant losses to all the people. For the above reasons, after careful consideration, we have made the following decisions regarding the issue of original year-end double pay or year-end bonuses for employees of public enterprises:

1.  All public enterprises that originally did not issue year-end double pay or bonuses will continue not to issue them.

2.  All public enterprises that originally issued year-end double pay or bonuses, but not exceeding half a month's wage, will be issued according to the original stipulated amount.

3.  All public enterprises that originally issued year-end double pay or bonuses exceeding half a month's wage, in addition to issuing double pay or bonuses of half a month's wage, the excess part will be issued at half the amount; however, the maximum shall not exceed two months' wages, and it can be issued in installments.

The management organs of public enterprises in various localities must immediately notify the trade unions and all employees of this decision, and explain in detail to the employees the reasons why the People's Government was forced to make this decision. It is hoped that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the leading organs of trade unions in various localities and enterprises can deeply understand the difficulties of the country, and be consistent with the management organs in jointly explaining to workers and staff, and negotiate with the management organs to resolve all disputes arising from this issue. We firmly believe that the Chinese working class has a high degree of political consciousness. In the past, in order to win the victory of the liberation of the people of the whole country and themselves, they carried out a long and heroic struggle and paid a great price of bloodshed and sacrifice. Now, in order to consolidate the victory they have won, consolidate the new democratic state power led by the working class itself, and to lay the foundation for building a democratic and happy New China, they will surely endure temporary difficulties with the same heroic fighting spirit in order to strive for a happy future. We firmly believe that the decision in this notice regarding the handling of old year-end double pay or bonuses will be unanimously supported by all employees of public enterprises.

　　政务院财经委员会通告
    关于某些公营企业原有年终双薪或奖金问题的处理办法
    【新华社北京十三日电】关于某些公营企业原有年终双薪或奖金问题的处理办法，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会于本月十一日发出通告如下：
    关于某些公营企业原有年终双薪或奖金问题的处理办法
    各大行政区，各省市人民政府财经管理部门及各公营企业管理机关：
    现在已是十二月中旬了，一九四九年的年终即将到来。有些公营企业，原来在国民党时代由于工人长期斗争的结果，有发给年终双薪或年终奖金的待遇。这是工人长年累月斗争得来的果实，我们本应予以承认，不愿废除。但是有这种双薪或奖金的，只有一部分企业，另一部分企业则没有，有双薪或奖金的企业，亦不一致，有的企业很少，有的企业则很多，甚至有多至四五个月工资者。在目前解放战争胜利发展的情形下，解放的地区愈大，国家军费、政费的开支也就愈加增多，而新收复区由于国民党反动军队破坏的结果，税收非常有限。而且目前战争尚未结束，为了争取最后胜利，解放西南，解放台湾，一时尚无法裁减军队，还需要国家耗费庞大的军事费用。加上被蒋匪破坏了的各种工矿交通事业急待恢复，又需国家支出很大的资金；因而，人民政府的财政收支，入不敷出，非常困难。如果年终一律照旧多发职工几个月的薪资，则国家财政开支势将大大提高，又必须被迫增发货币，就有可能引起再一次的物价波动。这就不但职工本身生活将遭受影响，且全体人民亦将因此蒙受重大损失。由于以上原因，我们在经过慎重考虑之后，对于公营企业，原有职工年终双薪或年终奖金问题，特作如下决定：
    一、所有公营企业，原来不发年终双薪或奖金者，一律照旧不发。
    二、所有公营企业，原来发年终双薪或奖金，但不超过半个月工资者，照原规定数目发给。
    三、所有公营企业，原来发给年终双薪或奖金超过半个月工资者，除加发半个月工资的双薪或奖金外，其超过部分折半发给；但最高不得超过两个月的工资，并可分期发给。
    各地公营企业管理机关，须将此项决定，立即通知工会及全体职工，并向职工详细解释人民政府迫不得已作此决定的原因。并希望中华全国总工会及各地方各企业中的工会领导机关能够深切体谅国家的困难，和管理机关一致，共同向工人职员解释，并和管理机关进行协商来解决因此一问题所引起之一切争议。我们深信中国工人阶级有高度的政治觉悟，过去为争取全国人民和自己解放的胜利，曾进行了长期英勇的斗争，付出了很大的流血牺牲的代价，现在为了巩固已得的胜利，巩固工人阶级自己领导的新民主主义的国家政权，为了奠定建设一个民主幸福的新中国的基础，必能以同样的英勇奋斗精神，忍受暂时的困难，来争取幸福的将来。我们深信本通告中关于旧有年终双薪或奖金处理办法的决定，必能获得各公营企业全体职工一致的拥护。
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会
    一九四九年十二月十一日
