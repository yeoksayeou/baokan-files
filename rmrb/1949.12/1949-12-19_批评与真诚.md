　　Criticism and Sincerity
　　Bai Yun
　　Criticism and self-criticism are sharp weapons for overcoming various incorrect thoughts in the revolutionary ranks, but they must be used skillfully to发挥发挥 its great role. How can we use them well? I think the most important thing is to grasp the word "sincerity." To care for and criticize others with a sincere attitude will never be inconsistent with seeking truth from facts, and will rarely be rejected by those being criticized. To make self-criticism with a sincere attitude will also truly remove the old and bring forth the new, remove chronic illnesses, and discard burdens! Because only in this way can we truly find the source of the disease. For example, in order to declare one's ideological progress, to insist on saying "I used to despise labor, secretly wiping the dust off my desk behind closed doors, afraid of being seen," is unimaginable.
　　Errors are inherently different from sins, and there must be a clear distinction in principle between the two. In the revolutionary camp, the mistakes of comrades must never be confused with the treatment of enemies. However, as far as a person's thoughts are concerned, others only see the manifested words and actions, and it is not easy to delve into the root of the thought. Therefore, a true revolutionary, in the revolutionary ranks, must not only treat others with sincerity, but must also be strict with himself! If there are faults, they should be like a solar or lunar eclipse, not to be concealed, and after correction, they will still shine brightly in the sky. The most joyful time for a person is when the spirit has no burden! Living honestly and straightforwardly, without any artifice, is so easy and happy!

　　批评与真诚

    批评与自我批评是革命队伍中克服各种不正确思想的锐利武器，但必须善于运用，才能发挥它的巨大作用。怎样才能运用得好呢？我以为最要紧的是必须掌握“真诚”二字。以真诚的态度去关心人家，批评人家，绝不会不是实事求是的，也很少有不为被批评的人所接受的。以真诚的态度作自我批评，也才会真正的去旧布新，才会拔去沉疴，丢掉包袱！因为这样才能真真的找到病源。例如为了声明自己思想的进步，硬说“从前贱视劳动，抹掉子都关上门干，怕被人看见。”这话是不可想象的。
    错误本来和罪恶不同，两者要有明确的原则区别，在革命阵营中，对待同志的错误，绝不能与对待敌人相混同。但作为一个人的思想来说，除了自己，别人看见的只是表现出来的言行部分，并不容易深入思想根源。所以一个真正的革命者，在革命队伍中，除了真诚待人外，定必真诚律己！有过失应当如日月之蚀，不必隐瞒，改过后则仍然经天照耀。人的最愉快时候，就是精神没有任何负担的时候！坦坦荡荡的生活着，毫无机巧的生活着，是多么轻松快乐啊！
