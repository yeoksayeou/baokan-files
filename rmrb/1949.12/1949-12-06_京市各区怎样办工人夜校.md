　　Since April and May, the district trade union offices in Beijing have been organizing worker night schools by district, mobilizing workers from private factories and various industries (workers from public factories have separate learning organizations) to study. Initially, the organized night schools did not have classes, clear regulations, or fixed teaching materials. In early November, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions clearly proposed organizing night schools by industry, dividing classes, formulating regulations and teaching materials, and striving to gradually bring night schools into order.

　　Based on the experience of the past six months, organizing worker night schools must first be combined with trade union organizational work. Several districts have adopted this approach. Night schools established in this way are generally more consolidated. For example, in Districts Four and Five, the district trade union office first actively discussed with the cadres and activists of various industry trade unions, and conducted酝酿 discussions among the workers. Then, a meeting of worker representatives from various units was held to jointly study the night school issue: preparing school sites and equipment, formulating night school regulations, determining class division standards based on the needs and educational level of the workers, and the district trade union was responsible for hiring teachers.

　　District Five adopted a method of cooperating with local schools when running worker night schools, which could solve the difficulties of cultural teachers and school sites. The Propaganda Department of the District Committee and the District Trade Union first cooperated with Yuan'ensi Elementary School to run a night school. Liu Bohan, the principal of Yuan'ensi Elementary School, was extremely enthusiastic, preparing classrooms, blackboards and other equipment, and mobilizing teachers from the school to teach cultural courses at the night school. Under his leadership, Dashiqiao, Qixin, XinSheng, Desheng, Jingren, Cihua and other primary schools, Qiushi Middle School, and Fu Jen Catholic University successively established worker night schools.

　　Most night schools have a school affairs committee, composed of one or more people elected by the participating units. They are responsible for leading the study, collecting workers' requirements and reactions, solving various problems, studying teaching content and methods, and ensuring night school study. The school affairs committees of the Xinjiekou Workers' Night School and the Steel Factory Workers' Night School in District Four, in order to more specifically divide responsibilities, specially set up statistics, cleaning, wall newspaper, discipline, recreation, general affairs, and inspection groups according to work needs to promote work. Some workers are both students and night school cadres, which not only cultivated workers' ability to handle affairs, but also consolidated the organization of the night school.

　　The curriculum of the night school should focus on cultural courses (initially, a period of political education should be conducted). The content of the teaching materials should be closely integrated with the lives of the workers, so that what they learn can be used. The four night schools in District One first taught students to write invoices, receipts, notes and other application documents; the tricycle workers' night school in District Five taught abacus and simple accounting and other practical courses, which was warmly supported by the workers. After several months of study, the cultural level of the workers has significantly improved. Students at several workers' night schools in District Four, who previously did not recognize a single character, now recognize an average of more than two hundred characters. In order to improve the cultural level of the workers, District Five formulated a two-month plan in mid-September (September 15 to November 15): the elementary class learned 180 characters and double-digit addition and subtraction, the intermediate class learned simple sentences and double-digit multiplication and division, and the advanced class learned to write diaries, letters, and four arithmetic operations with integers. According to the results of the examination, the original plan was generally completed, and some exceeded this limit. For example, Li Xianyu from the Qiujiahutong Workers' Night School was originally in the elementary class, but after two months of study, he is now at the intermediate level and can write simple lecture drafts. The achievement of these results is inseparable from the teaching methods of cultural teachers. When cultural teachers Zhang Jingsu, Wang Ruyang, and Zhang Tinglin of District Five gave lectures, they often explained the general idea of ​​the lesson first, extracted the center like telling a story, and then inspired the workers to ask questions. The teachers patiently explained it once or twice with concrete examples. The workers liked to listen very much and dared to ask questions boldly. Finally, they taught the text word by word. There was no separation between them and the workers. Workers went to the teachers anytime, anywhere to find problems in extracurricular activities and in the reading room.

　　Although political courses in worker night schools are not the main courses, they are more difficult to teach. Attention must be paid to the methods and styles of lecturing. It is best to have fixed teachers so that the relationship between students and teachers is close, and they can understand each other's situation. Students dare to ask questions boldly, and teachers can explain more in the most difficult places to understand according to the students' understanding. In order to run the worker night school well, District Five once convened teachers for a symposium, listened to the workers' requirements and opinions, exchanged teaching methods or experiences, so that problems could be solved in a timely manner. Some night schools adopt flexible teaching methods, which have achieved great results. Some night schools in District Five combine workers' personal lives to teach political classes. For example, when explaining the principle of "labor creates the world," they inspire workers to recognize themselves, recall the past, look at the present, and look forward to the future, to establish a sense of ownership. Some political teachers have used the method of teaching singing to assist in teaching political classes, and through the content of the songs, they have improved the political understanding of the workers.

　　Recreational activities are an indispensable part of worker night schools. In addition to political and cultural classes, workers also hope to take recreational classes. The workers in the senior and intermediate classes in the Eleventh District Workers' Night School like to go to the elementary class to take classes because "they can learn songs."

　　Six night schools in District Five have now run wall newspapers. The two night schools of Cihua and Yanjing have established reading rooms. The workers themselves raised money to buy a large number of books and set up gongs, drums and other musical instruments, becoming a prototype of a club. After work, some workers go to the reading room to read books, some practice singing, and some beat gongs and drums and dance秧歌.

　　When night school classes reach a certain stage, tests should be held. This can not only understand the workers' learning achievements, encourage and stimulate learning enthusiasm, but also discover problems and improve teaching methods through examinations. After the first test in the first class of the First Night School in District Eleven, some workers achieved good results, while others were poor. The poor said: "Why did I get so few points? Look at how good other people are. I will definitely work hard next time." Some workers in the first class of the Second Night School put forward their opinions: they hope to hold more examinations in the future, and pay attention to the usual grades and classroom situations. Huo Fuliang, a worker at the Gongmao Automobile Company in District One, was previously the most backward in learning. After a test, it greatly stimulated him. The political teacher seized the opportunity, talked to him, encouraged him, and specifically helped him. Huo Fuliang became an activist. He always carries a book with him and takes it out to read whenever he has free time.

　　In many worker night schools, the leading study of Youth League members and activists has promoted the study of other workers and consolidated everyone's learning confidence; night schools can also closely contact the district Youth League Committee, discover activists from night school studies, and train League member candidates. More than 20 female workers from the Hengdecheng Factory in District Five joined the Youth League, played a core role in night school studies, and promoted learning. Youth League members in the Qiujiahutong Workers' Night School raised money to buy some books and set up a mobile library. Every day before class, League members carry the books to the classroom for everyone to read. Many workers come to read an hour before class. Among the ten or so workers in the Sanhecheng Iron Factory in District Four, only four people originally studied. Later, because those who participated in the study made significant progress, other workers also followed suit and went to night school. Worker Zu Zhongyuan was admitted to the North China People's Revolutionary University after participating in the study, and was elected as the group leader, which greatly encouraged the workers who were studying.

　　京市各区怎样办工人夜校
    从四、五月份开始，北京市各区工会办事处就以地区为单位组织工人夜校，发动各私营工厂工人与各行业工人（公营工厂工人另有学习组织）学习。最初组织的夜校不分班，没有明确的制度，教材也不固定。十一月初，市总工会明确提出以行业为单位组织夜校，分班，制定制度和教材，努力使夜校逐步走入正规。
    根据半年来的经验，组织工人夜校首先必须和工会组织工作结合起来。有几个区采用了这个办法。经过这样搞起来的夜校一般是比较巩固的。如四、五两区首由区工会办事处主动的和各行业工会的干部、积极分子商谈，并在工人当中进行酝酿讨论。然后，召开各单位工人代表会议，共同研究夜校问题：筹备校址及用具，制订夜校制度，根据工人的需要和文化程度定出分班标准，区工会再负责聘请教员。
    五区在办理工人夜校时，采用了和驻地学校配合的办法，这样可以解决文化教员和校址的困难。五区区委会宣传部、区工会首先和圆恩寺小学校合作，办了一个夜校，圆恩寺小学校长刘伯涵极为热心，筹备教室、黑板等用具，并动员该校教员担任夜校文化课程。在他的带头下，大石桥、启新、欣生、德胜、竞仁、慈华等小学，求实中学，辅仁大学都先后成立了工人夜校。
    各夜校大多有校务委员会，由参加学习的各单位选举一人或数人组成。负责领导学习，搜集工人的要求和反应，解决各种问题，研究教学内容和方法，保证夜校学习。四区新街口工人夜校及钢铁厂工人夜校的校委会为了更具体地分工负责，根据工作需要特设统计、整洁、壁报、纪律、康乐、总务、检查等组，分头推动工作。有些工人是学员，又是夜校干部，既培养了工人办事能力，又巩固了夜校的组织。
    夜校的课程应以文化课为主（开始时进行一段政治教育）。教材内容最好能密切结合工人的生活，做到学了能用。一区四个夜校首先教学员学写发票，收据，便条等应用文；五区三轮工人夜校教授珠算及简单的会计等实用的课程，得到了工人的热烈拥护。经过几个月的学习，工人们文化水准显著地提高了。四区几个工人夜校的学员，从前不认识一个字，现在平均已认得二百多字。五区为了提高工人的文化程度，于九月中旬订出了两月计划（九月十五日至十一月十五日）：初级班学会一百八十个字和双位加减法，中级班学会简单的句子和双位乘除法，高级班学会写日记、书信及整数四则。据考试结果看，大体上完成了原订计划，部分的已超过了这个限度，如邱家胡同工人夜校李宪玉，原来是初级班的，经过两月来的学习，现在已够中级程度了，能写简单的讲演稿子。这些成绩的获得与文化教员的教学方法是分不开的，五区文化教员张景苏、王汝洋、张庭麟讲课时，常常先把这一课的大意讲一遍，象讲故事似的把中心提出来，然后启发工人们提问题，教员耐心地一次二次用具体的例子进行解释，工人们很喜欢听，也敢大胆的发问，最后再一字一句的教会课文。他们和工人之间没有一点隔阂，工人们在课外，在阅览室，随时随地发现问题都去找教员。
    工人夜校的政治课虽不是主要功课，但却是比较难教的功课，必须注意讲课的方法、方式，最好能做到固定教员，使学员与教员之间的关系密切起来，互相了解情况，学生敢大胆提问题，教员根据学生的认识，在最难懂的地方多加解释。五区为了把工人夜校办好，曾经召集教员进行座谈，听取工人的要求和意见，交换教学方法或心得，使问题及时得到解决。有的夜校采用灵活的教学方法，收效很大。五区有些夜校结合工人的切身生活教政治课。如讲“劳动创造世界”的道理时，即启发工人认识自己，回想过去，看看现在，瞻望将来，建立主人翁的思想。有的政治教员曾经用教唱歌的方法辅助教政治课，通过歌子的内容，提高工人的政治认识。
    文娱活动是工人夜校不可少的一部分。工人们除了上政治课、文化课外，还希望上文娱课。十一区工人夜校中的高、中两班的工友喜欢到初级班去上课，因为“可以学学歌子”。
    五区现已有六个夜校办了壁报。慈华、燕京两个夜校都成立了阅览室、工人们自己凑钱，买了一大批书，并置有锣鼓乐器等，成为一个俱乐部的雏型。工人们一下班后，有的就到阅览室看书，有的练习唱歌，有的打起锣鼓，扭起秧歌。
    夜校上课到一定阶段时，应举行测验，这不但可以了解工人学习的成绩，鼓励与刺激学习情绪，更可通过考试，发现问题，提高教学方法。十一区第一夜校第一班测验后，有的工人成绩很好，有的较差，差的说：“我怎么得这点分数，看人家那么好，我下一次一定努力好好学习。”第二夜校第一班有工人提出意见：希望以后多举行考试，并注意平时的成绩和上课的情形。一区公懋汽车行的工友霍福亮，以前在学习中表现最落后，经过一次测验后，大大刺激了他，政治教员抓紧机会，找他谈话，加以鼓励，又具体帮助他，霍福亮变成了积极分子。他经常随身带着一本书，一有空就拿出来看。
    有许多工人夜校，青年团员与积极分子的带头学习，推动了其他工人的学习，巩固了大家的学习信心；夜校又可与区团委密切联系，从夜校学习中发现积极分子，培养团员对象。五区恒德成工厂二十多名女工加入了青年团，在夜校学习中起了核心作用，推动了学习。邱家胡同工人夜校中的青年团员集资买了一些书，成立了流动图书馆，每天上课前由团员把书背来，放在教室里供大家看，许多工人上课前一个钟头就来看书。四区三合成铁工厂十来个工人中，本来只有四个人学习。后来因为参加了学习的人有显著的进步，其他工人也跟着上夜校了。工人祖仲元参加学习后考上了华北人民革命大学，并被选为组长，给学习的工人以很大鼓励。
