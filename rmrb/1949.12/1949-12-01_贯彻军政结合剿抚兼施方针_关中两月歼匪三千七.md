Implementing the Policy of Military-Political Combination, Suppressing and Appeasing Simultaneously
　　3,700 Bandits Eliminated in Guanzhong in Two Months
　　[Report from this newspaper] The bandit suppression work in various parts of Guanzhong, Shaanxi, in September and October has achieved significant results and several important experiences. When the Northwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army convened a military construction conference in late August, the more than 40,000 reactionary armed forces originally entrenched in various parts of Guanzhong had been mostly annihilated, but there were still more than 40 remnant bandit gangs, totaling more than 6,000 people, still active. After the military region meeting, the Baoji, Binxian, Xianyang, Sanyuan, Weinan, Dali, and other sub-districts, based on the bandit suppression policy of combining military and political affairs, and suppressing and appeasing simultaneously, carried out suppression in September and October, eliminating a total of 3,709 bandits, including 449 killed or wounded, 1,746 captured, and 1,514 who surrendered or were incorporated. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people, reporting bandit activity and leading the way for reconnaissance, the troops were victorious everywhere in their attacks, and in the bandit suppression struggle, established people's armed forces with pure elements.
　　The following experiences were gained in bandit suppression in various places: (1) The bandit suppression struggle must be closely combined with mobilizing the masses. (2) Military suppression and political disintegration must be closely coordinated. (3) Recognize the different situations in the new areas and take effective actions accordingly. In general, in new areas, after the enemy's military strength is destroyed, the power of the people's government has not yet been popularized and deepened, and the masses have not yet been mobilized. The enemy's puppet reactionary armed forces, combined with scattered soldiers and habitual bandits, can still operate in a relatively concentrated manner; however, after being suppressed by the main force, most of them become small groups of scattered bandits of three to five or ten people. There should be a full understanding of these two different situations, and there should be some distinction in the military steps taken in the implementation of bandit suppression. (4) The treatment of surrendered bandits and captured bandits must be carefully studied and appropriately handled according to the policy of punishing the ringleaders, not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding those who render meritorious service. (5) Organize joint defense between districts and counties, break down the boundaries between counties or between sub-districts, uniformly form a bandit suppression headquarters, select a central location, and station troops for a long time. (6) In the new areas, especially in ethnic minority areas, when carrying out bandit suppression, it is necessary to first grasp the social situation, the conditions of the masses, and widely and correctly publicize the policies of the people's government, especially the policies towards ethnic minorities, to win over the broad masses of ethnic minorities to participate in the bandit suppression struggle, and isolate the bandits and reactionary armed forces.

　　贯彻军政结合剿抚兼施方针
  　关中两月歼匪三千七
    【本报讯】陕西大关中各地九、十两月的剿匪工作，获得显著成绩和几点重要经验。八月下旬人民解放军西北军区召开建军会议时，原盘踞于关中各地的四万余反动武装，已大部被歼，但尚有残匪四十余股约六千余人还在活动。军区会议后，宝鸡、彬县、咸阳、三原、渭南、大荔等分区即依据军政结合、剿抚兼施的剿匪方针，于九、十两月间进行清剿，共消灭土匪三七零九人，内毙伤土匪四四九人，俘掳一七四六人，投诚及被收编者一五一四人。由于广大人民的热烈支援，报告匪情，带路侦查，使部队出击处处获胜，并在剿匪斗争中，建立了成份纯洁的人民武装。
    各地在剿匪中获得如下几点经验：（一）剿匪斗争必须与发动群众密切结合。（二）军事清剿与政治瓦解必须密切配合。（三）认清新区不同情况，分别采取有效行动。一般新区在摧毁敌人军事力量之后，人民政权力量尚不普及深入，群众尚未发动起来，敌伪反动武装结合散兵游勇及惯匪，尚能较集中地活动；但经主力清剿后，除大部消灭外，则多流为三五人至十数人的小股散匪。对这两种不同的情况，要有充分认识，在剿匪实施的军事步骤上应有所区别。（四）对降匪、俘匪的处理，必须按照首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖的政策，分别对象慎重研究，适当处理。（五）组织区县联防，打破县与县或分区与分区间的界限，统一组成剿匪指挥部，选定中心地点，长期驻剿。（六）在新区，特别在省数民族区域进行剿匪时，必须先掌握社会情况，群众条件，广泛地正确地宣传人民政府的政策，特别是对少数民族政策，争取少数民族的广大人民参加剿匪斗争，孤立土匪反动武装。
