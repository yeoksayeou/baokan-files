　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 8th: Pravda published an editorial on the 6th entitled "The International Responsibility of All Communist and Workers' Parties," stating that the Cominform's resolution and Gheorghiu-Dej's report on "The Yugoslav Communist Party in the Hands of Murderers and Spies" both point out that the Tito-Ranković group has completed its journey from bourgeois nationalism to fascism. The struggle against Yugoslav spies and murderers is the international responsibility of all Communist and Workers' Parties.
    Recent events in Yugoslavia fully confirm the correctness of the Cominform's resolution passed in June 1948, vividly demonstrating the enormous importance of this historical document for the world revolutionary movement. The resolution focused the attention of the world revolutionary movement on the struggle against the most dangerous enemy of socialism and proletarian internationalism – bourgeois nationalism.
    In the new situation after World War II, the Communist and Workers' Parties (especially in the People's Democratic countries), guided by the Cominform's resolution, are waging a victorious struggle against nationalist tendencies in their ranks. As a result, they have strengthened their combat effectiveness and are more filled with the ideas of proletarian internationalism, and are more convinced that the loyalty of any revolutionary leader to the Soviet Union (the victorious socialist country) is the test of his loyalty to socialism.
    The Tito group's transformation to fascism is not accidental. As the results of the Rajk-Brankov trial in Hungary prove, and as can be seen from the indictment in the Kostov and his accomplices case in Bulgaria, the Tito group's defection to the imperialist camp was done on the orders of the Anglo-American imperialists. The Yugoslav spies and murderers were already a group of servants of these imperialists during the Yugoslav people's war of liberation against German fascism.
    The Yugoslav Communists, workers, and peasants who are loyal to the socialist and democratic camp, will not and never will compromise with these traitorous policies. They are increasingly actively opposing the fascist usurpers. This struggle is constantly developing and will undoubtedly lead to the victory of socialist and democratic forces.
    The editorial concludes by emphasizing the Cominform's resolution, stating that one of the most important tasks of the Communist and Workers' Parties is to vigorously raise revolutionary vigilance in the ranks of the party, expose and eradicate bourgeois nationalists and running dogs of imperialism, no matter how they may be disguised. It is necessary to tirelessly intensify ideological work in the Communist and Workers' Parties, to educate all Communists in the spirit of loyalty to proletarian internationalism, in the spirit of irreconcilability to any departure from Marxist-Leninist principles, and in the spirit of loyalty to people's democracy and socialism.

### 一切共产党与工人党的国际责任　真理报论情报局关于反对铁托的决议

  　真理报论情报局关于反对铁托的决议
    【新华社北京八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于六日发表题为“一切共产党与工人党的国际责任”的社论称：共产党与工人党情报局的决议和乔治乌——德治关于“在杀人犯与间谍掌握中的南斯拉夫共产党”的报告都指出：铁托——兰科维奇集团，已经走完了从资产阶级民族主义到法西斯主义的路程，反对南斯拉夫间谍与杀人犯的斗争，是一切共产党与工人党的国际责任。
    南斯拉夫最近的事件，完全证实了情报局在一九四八年六月所通过的决议的正确性，生动地表明了这一历史性的文件对于世界革命运动的巨大重要性。决议使全世界革命运动的注意力集中在反对社会主义与无产阶级国际主义的最危险敌人——资产阶级民族主义的斗争上面。
    在第二次世界大战以后的新形势下，以情报局决议作为自己指针的共产党与工人党（尤其是在人民民主的国家里），正在对它们队伍中的民族主义偏向进行胜利的斗争，它们因此加强了自己的战斗力，并且已更加充满无产阶级国际主义的思想，更加深信任何一个革命领袖对于苏联（胜利的社会主义国家的忠诚，都是对他的对社会主义之忠诚的考验。
    铁托集团的转变到法西斯主义，并不是偶然的。正如匈牙利的拉伊克——布兰科夫审判案的结果所证实的一样，正如从保加利亚的科斯托夫及其同谋犯一案的起诉书中可以看出的一样，铁托集团的投奔帝国主义阵营，是奉英美帝国主义者的命令所作的，而南斯拉夫的间谍们与杀人犯们，早在南斯拉夫人民对德国法西斯进行解放战争期间，就已是这些帝国主义者的一群奴仆了。
    忠于社会主义与民主阵营的南斯拉夫共产党人、工人和农民，不肯而且永远也不会和这些叛逆政策妥协。他们越来越积极地反对法西斯篡夺者。这一斗争正在不断地发展，而且无疑地将导向社会主义和民主力量的胜利。
    社论最后着重引述情报局的决议称：共产党与工人党最重要的任务之一，是在党的队伍中竭力提高革命警惕性，揭露并根除资产阶级民族主义分子和帝国主义的走卒，不论他们会作怎样的打扮。必须在共产党与工人党中不疲倦地加紧进行思想工作，以忠于无产阶级国际主义的精神，以对任何背离马列主义原则的不可调和性，以忠于人民民主与社会主义的精神，来教育一切共产党人。
