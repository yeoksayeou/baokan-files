　　Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 6th: A unit of the Western Route People's Liberation Army on the Guangxi front has successively captured the three cities of Wangang, Du'an, and Bose, advancing into the Youjiang River basin, the base area of the Red Seventh Army during the Agrarian Revolutionary War. This unit of the People's Liberation Army carried out a long-distance flanking maneuver, starting from the vicinity of Wugang in southern Hunan on November 6th, taking the route through the border between Guizhou and Guangxi, crossing steep stone mountains and the swiftly flowing Hongshui River, passing through areas inhabited by ethnic minorities such as the Miao and Zhuang peoples. Despite difficulties such as heavy rain, slippery roads, and food shortages, they marched day and night, opening up roads for subsequent troops. In less than twenty days, they successively captured the cities of Liping, Rongjiang, Yibei, Si'en, Hechi, and Donglan, annihilating the direct units of the enemy's 103rd Army and most of the 347th Division and part of the 234th Division, capturing more than 3,000 enemy soldiers, including the commander of the 347th Division, Fu Mokui. After this unit crossed the Hongshui River and liberated Donglan, they liberated Wangang County on the 1st of this month; at 16:00 on the 5th, they occupied Bose City, an important town on the transportation and communication junction on the border of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The defending enemy fled westward. Order within the city is good. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army also liberated Du'an City on the 5th, capturing a portion of the enemy's security forces.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 6th: The People's Liberation Army advancing towards eastern Sichuan has successively liberated four cities including Wushan, Fengjie, Changshou, and Fengdu, with bandits and puppet troops surrendering one after another. The People's Liberation Army occupied Wushan County on the 2nd. All officers and soldiers of the 3rd Brigade of the enemy's Hubei Security Forces, stationed east of the city at Huofengyi, more than 1,600 men, carrying 25 light machine guns and more than 800 rifles, surrendered. On the 3rd, our army liberated Fengjie, and the puppet county magistrate of the county led more than 800 men to surrender. The People's Liberation Army annihilated a portion of the 933rd Regiment of the enemy's 311th Division on its way forward. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army liberated Changshou a few days ago, and liberated Fengdu City on the 3rd, capturing more than 300 members of the enemy county brigade and seizing more than 3,500 rounds of artillery shells. On the 4th, this unit, in its advance, forced more than 1,200 men from a regiment of the enemy's 127th Army, who had no way out, to lay down their weapons and surrender. In addition, two battalions, more than 400 men, of the 77th Regiment of the enemy's 243rd Division of the 108th Army also surrendered to the People's Liberation Army with their weapons on the 2nd.
