　　The North China Agricultural Machinery Factory Establishes a Technical School, First Class Begins
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The agricultural machinery technical school attached to the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory held its opening ceremony on the 19th at Jiulong Mountain in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. First, Vice Principal Sun Jinglu reported on the school's preparation process, followed by a speech by Academic Dean Liu Xianzhou, who said: "The agricultural tools used by Chinese farmers have not been renovated since the Qin and Han dynasties, and productivity cannot be developed. After liberation, I deeply felt that only the Communist Party and the People's Government can truly solve this problem for the people." Representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Agricultural College of Nanjing University, and Yu Youtai, an agricultural machinery expert from East China, also spoke, encouraging students to study hard and learn the complete skills of repairing, using, and manufacturing agricultural machinery. The first class of the school has more than 50 students, and the study period is one year. (New)
