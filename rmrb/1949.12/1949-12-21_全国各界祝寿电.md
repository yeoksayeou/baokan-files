    On the glorious occasion of your 70th birthday, the birthday of you—the great leader of the Soviet people and the revolutionary teacher of the working people of the world—we extend to you our warmest congratulations. Your constant and deep concern for the cause of the Chinese people's revolution, your instructions, and your encouragement have given us a clear direction and boundless strength. In particular, your famous saying about the characteristics of armed struggle has been fully embodied in our practice for more than 20 years, demonstrating your brilliant guidance. The invincible Soviet Red Army, nurtured by you, has become the highest example for us to emulate. We are continuing to eliminate the remaining enemies in the mainland and seas of East China and are determined to build a regularized and modernized army to defend the sacred borders of the motherland and safeguard lasting world peace. We firmly believe that due to the increasing strength of the socialist Soviet Union under your leadership, due to the fact that the advanced working people of the world are armed with the Marxist-Leninist theory that you have highly developed, and due to the unwavering and increasingly strengthened friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people, the imperialist warmongers will eventually die, and lasting world peace and people's democracy will eventually be realized. Your name will guide all mankind towards eternal liberation.

The Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism for more than a hundred years has finally defeated all enemies at home and abroad and established their own people's democratic republic. This is also inseparable from the friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union and your wise instructions. Your name is forever linked with the liberation struggles of the Chinese people and the people of the world. We express our gratitude to you and wish you longevity.
    Long live Stalin, the great teacher and friend of the working people of the world!
