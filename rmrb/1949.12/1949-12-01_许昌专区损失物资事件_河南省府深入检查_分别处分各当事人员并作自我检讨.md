　　Incident of Lost Materials in Xuchang Area
  　Henan Provincial Government Conducts Thorough Inspection
    Disciplines Responsible Personnel, and Conducts Self-Criticism
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th] Due to insufficient sense of responsibility for protecting state property, several state-owned enterprises in the Xuchang area of Henan Province lost a large amount of materials this summer. After an on-site investigation by the Henan Provincial People's Government, the matter was dealt with last month. Three incidents of significant material loss occurred in the Xuchang area this summer: (1) At the end of June, over 13 million catties of rice and wheat were concentrated at the Xuchang, Changge, Luohe, and Linying stations along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, awaiting transport. Due to train delays and improper storage of the grain and coverings, over 600,000 catties of grain were soaked in water after rain. Fortunately, after the Commissioner's Office mobilized cadres and laborers to quickly inspect and dry the grain, it was stored, transported south, loaned out, and sold off, reducing the loss to the equivalent of just over 20,000 catties of wheat. (2) From November of last year to June of this year, the state-owned Taifeng Tobacco Company purchased over 30,000 packages of tobacco leaves in Xuchang, totaling approximately 8 million catties. Due to the company's lack of warehouse facilities and management, these tobacco leaves were dispersed among 23 private tobacco firms for storage, most of which were stored outdoors. After heavy rain on July 3, the tobacco packages stored in 21 private tobacco firms were flooded, resulting in a loss of over 110,000 catties of tobacco leaves. Including the costs of repairing and turning over the packages, and re-curing, the total loss was equivalent to over 297,000 catties of wheat. (3) The Xuchang Trading Company also lacked warehouse facilities, so all grains, tobacco leaves, salt, and cotton were entrusted to private grain and tobacco firms for outdoor storage. After the heavy rain, over 11,000 catties of salt and 6,500 catties of tobacco leaves were flooded. Paper and cigarettes stored indoors were also partially damaged due to roof leaks, resulting in a total loss equivalent to over 32,000 catties of wheat. The total loss from the above three items, converted to wheat at the market price at the time, amounted to over 350,000 catties. After sending personnel to the Xuchang area for a detailed investigation, the Henan Provincial People's Government issued a circular last month, explaining the details of the material losses suffered by the various units, examining the causes of the losses, and announcing the disciplinary actions taken against the relevant departments and responsible personnel. The circular pointed out that the reason for the massive loss of materials was that the leading organs at all levels had serious bureaucratic leadership styles, lacked a sense of responsibility for protecting state property, did not understand the importance of warehouse construction, and lacked knowledge of material storage. The circular stated that regarding the Taifeng Tobacco Company's tobacco leaf storage problem, the provincial government failed to actively assist the Trade Corporation in understanding the situation and striving to build warehouses as soon as possible, and did not consider other preventive measures as the rainy season approached. Regarding the military grain stored at Luohe and other stations, although the Commissioner's Office had requested instructions from the provincial government several times, the provincial government failed to take timely measures to prevent accidents, but only relied on the logistics department to dispatch vehicles, and did not send personnel to thoroughly handle the matter afterward. These are all concrete manifestations of the provincial government's serious bureaucratic work style. Secondly, although the grain at the stations was concentrated on time, the coordination between various parties was ineffective, and vehicle transportation was repeatedly delayed, which shows that the organization and coordination of various tasks, especially the use of modern transportation tools, still lacked experience. As for the units that suffered losses, if they had attached great importance to state property, carefully assessed the situation in advance, overcome various difficulties, and made every effort to utilize all conditions to store materials, and immediately inspected and handled the matter afterward, these losses could have been avoided or reduced. The circular pointed out that in the future, all localities should accelerate the construction of already approved warehouses, and governments at all levels should ensure that autumn grain is stored in new warehouses. Rural warehouses should be immediately and universally inspected and repaired. All localities should summarize warehouse storage experience and promote it, striving to avoid suffering losses again in the future or minimizing losses as much as possible. The circular stated that, based on the results of the investigation into the material loss incident, the provincial government believes that the provincial government and the Provincial Trade Corporation were usually negligent in inspection and should conduct self-criticism and request disciplinary action from higher-level government; Liu Liuzhou, supervisor of the Taifeng Company, and Duan Zhang, manager, were given demerits and criticism respectively; Guo Xianglin, manager of the Xuchang Trading Company, was given a criticism; the Xuchang Commissioner's Office Grain Depot was exempted from punishment because it reported the matter in advance and handled it in a timely manner afterward.

　　许昌专区损失物资事件
  　河南省府深入检查
    分别处分各当事人员并作自我检讨
    【新华社北京二十八日电】河南省许昌专区若干公营企业，由于爱护国家财产的责任心不足，于今年夏季损失大量物资，经河南省人民政府实地调查后，已于上月处理。许昌专区今夏共发生损失大量物资事件三起：（一）六月底，京汉路许昌、长葛、漯河、临颍四站集中米麦一千三百余万斤待运，因火车误点，粮食铺盖保管不好，致天雨后有六十余万斤粮食被浸水中。幸经专署动员干部民工迅速检查、翻晒后分别入库、南运、贷出、发卖，才使损失减到折合小麦二万余斤。（二）公营泰丰烟草公司自去年十一月至今年六月，共在许昌购有烟叶三万余包，约八百余万斤。因公司缺管仓库设备，此项烟叶分散由二十三家私营烟行代为保存，其中大多系露天存放。七月三日大雨后，有二十一家私营烟行所存烟包被淹，致损失烟叶十一万余斤，加上事后修包、翻包、回炕等费用，共折小麦二十九万七千余斤。（三）许昌贸易公司亦因无仓库设备，所有粮食、烟叶以至食盐、棉花均托各私营粮行、烟行露天代存，大雨后，被淹食盐一万一千余斤，烟叶六千五百余斤，屋内存放的纸张、香烟亦因屋漏等原因被浸一部，损失共合小麦三万二千余斤。以上三项损失，按当时市价折成小麦，共达三十五万余斤之巨。河南省人民政府在派员赴许昌专区详细调查后，特于上月发出通报，说明此次各单位损失物资的经过，检讨损失的原因，并公布有关部门和负责人员的处分。通报指出：此次大量物资遭受损失，其原因为各级领导机关存在着严重的官僚主义领导方法，缺乏爱护国家财产的责任心，不懂得仓库建设的重要及缺乏保管物资的知识。通报说，对于泰丰公司的烟叶保管问题，省府未能积极帮助贸易总公司了解情况，争取早日修建仓库，雨季迫近时又未考虑其他预防办法；对于漯河等车站所存军粮，虽经专署数度请示，省府未能及时作出预防意外情况发生的措施，只是依赖后勤部调车，事后又未及时派人前往彻底处理。这些都是省府领导上严重的官僚主义作风的具体表现。其次，各站粮食虽按时集中，但各方面配合不灵，车运屡次误时，这说明各方面工作的组织和配合，尤其是对近代交通工具的使用度还缺乏经验。至于遭受损失的各单位，如能十分重视国家财产，事先详细估计情况，克服各种困难，尽量利用一切条件保管物资，事后立即检查处理，这些损失也能避免或者减轻。通报指出，今后各地应加速修建已经批准的仓库，各级政府应保证秋粮屯入新仓，农村仓库应马上普遍检查、修补。各地应总结仓库保管经验并予推广，力求今后不再遭受损失或尽量减少损失。通报说，省府根据对求此次物资损失事件的调查结果，认为省府、省贸易公司平时疏于检点，应作检讨，并请示上级政府处分；泰丰公司监委刘柳舟、经理段章，分别予以记过、批评的处分；许昌贸易公司经理郭祥林予批评处分；许昌专署粮库因事先报告、事后处理及时、免于处分。
