　　Who Does the Blockade Harm?
    Lin Moqing
    American imperialists attempt to use the blockade of the People's Republic of China's ports by supporting the Kuomintang reactionary bandit gangs as a means of attacking the Chinese people. But the facts tell us that the Chinese people have not been intimidated by the blockade, and they have every means to overcome the difficulties caused by the blockade. On the contrary, it is American imperialism itself that has been seriously hit. This can be clearly seen from the commerce of the American West Coast.
    Let's take the state of Oregon on the American West Coast as an example. Its third largest trading partner is China. According to Miller's Review, the U.S. support for the Kuomintang reactionary bandit gangs' blockade of the People's Republic of China's ports has caused serious losses to Oregon's foreign trade. Portland, an important port in the state, exported a total of 2,980,843,565 pounds of goods in 1929, but in the first half of 1949, despite an increase of more than 120,000 people, the total amount of goods exported decreased to 1,358,893,651 pounds. The main reason for this reduction is that Portland's trade with China has now dropped to less than 1% of what it was 20 years ago, accounting for only 5% of the trade volume a year ago. The following table shows the situation of Portland's exports to China over the years:
  Year　　　      　Total Goods Export Value　  　　　    Timber Export Value
  1929　　545,781,499　　399,782,783
  1937　　145,548,618　　29,642,160
  1941　　72,662,096　　7,519,895
  1948　　96,271,371　　13,866,454
  1949　　3,907,025  　192,448
    　　　　　　　　　(Unit: pounds, all calculated based on the first six months of trade)
    Taking timber as an example, exports to China have now completely stopped. According to the estimate of the Allied Woodworkers Union, if the Far East market is not closed, the woodworkers in Oregon will not have 50% unemployment as they do today. The two largest timber companies in Portland have now reduced their scope or switched to other businesses. Flour is also an important item in Portland's trade with China. In 1941, China imported a total of 29,212,428 pounds from Portland. Today, its flour market in China has completely disappeared, which means that Oregon's grain trade volume will be reduced by 10% to 20%. According to the estimate of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 8, if trade with China is not restored, one-third of the union's workers will be unemployed.
    This picture precisely illustrates who the real victim of the blockade is. It is the American people who have become the victims of the American imperialist aggression policy.

### 封锁害了谁？

　　封锁害了谁？
    林墨卿
    美国帝国主义者企图用支持国民党反动匪帮对人民中国海口之封锁，作为向中国人民进攻的手段。但事实却告诉我们，中国人民并没有在封锁面前被吓倒，他们有一切办法来克服由封锁所造成的困难。而相反地，受到真正严重打击的，乃是美国帝国主义自己。这从美国西海岸的商业，就可很清楚地看出来。
    我们就说美国西海岸的奥勒冈州吧，其第三大贸易对手国，就是中国。根据密勒氏评论报所载，美国支持国民党反动匪帮对人民中国海口之封锁，使得奥勒冈的对外贸易受到严重损失，该州重要港口波特兰在一九二九年时，输出货物共达二、九八○、八四三、五六五磅，但在一九四九年上半年中，虽然人口增加十二万余人，但输出货物总数却减至一、三五八、八九三、六五一磅。这一减少的主要原因，即是由于波特兰对中国的贸易，现在已降低到不及二十年前的百分之一，仅占一年前贸易量的百分之五。下表显示历年波特兰城对中国输出的情况：
  年代　　　      　全部货物出口额　  　　　    木材出口额
  一九二九　　五四五、七八一、四九九　　三九九、七八二、七八三
  一九三七　　一四五、五四八、六一八　　二九、六四二、一六○
  一九四一　　七二、六六二、○九六　　七、五一九、八九五
  一九四八　　九六、二七一、三七一　　一三、八六六、四五四
  一九四九　　三、九○七、○二五  　一九二、四四八、
    　　　　　　　　　（单位磅，都按前六个月贸易量计算）
    以木材为例，现在已经完全停止向中国输出了，据产联木工工会的估计，如果远东市场不被封闭，那么，奥勒冈州的木工工人将不会如今天那样，有百分之五十的失业者，现在特兰的两家最大的木材公司，都已缩小范围或改营其他业了。面粉也是波特兰对中国贸易的重要项目之一，一九四一年，中国自波城共输入二九、二一二、四二八磅，今天它在中国的面粉市场已经完全消失，这就意味着奥勒冈州谷物贸易量要减少百分之十至百分之二十。根据码头工会第八地方工会的估计，如果中国贸易不恢复，该工会就要有三分之一的失业工人。
    这一幅图画恰恰说明了谁是封锁的真正受害者。成为美国帝国主义侵略政策牺牲品的正是美国的人民。
