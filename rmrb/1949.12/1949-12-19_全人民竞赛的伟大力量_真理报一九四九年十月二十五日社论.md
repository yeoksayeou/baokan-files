　　The Great Power of the All-People Competition
    —Truth Daily Editorial, October 25, 1949
    (Translated by Liu Jing)
    The Soviet people are greeting the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Revolution with a high degree of political and labor enthusiasm. The lives of Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals are filled with creative inspiration, filled with the struggle to complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    Comrade Stalin said: Socialist competition is the communist method of socialist construction based on the high initiative of millions of working people. The struggle to complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule has an all-people essence, encompassing more than nine-tenths of workers and staff. This competition promotes the speed of Soviet production and accelerates our march toward communism.
    Comrade Stalin said: "The awareness that workers are not working for capitalists, but for their own country, their own class, is the greatest driving force for the development and improvement of our industry."
    Today's "Truth Daily" details the moving creative labor of the Kuznetsk Stalin Metallurgical Combine.
    The Kuznetsk factory is part of our country's eastern coal and metallurgical base. Comrade Stalin instructed at the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "Develop the fuel and metallurgical base of Ukraine in every possible way, and it is necessary to immediately start creating a second coal and metallurgical base. This base should be the Ural-Kuznetsk Combine, that is, the combination of Kuznetsk's coking coal and the Ural's mineral deposits."
    The magnificent coal and metallurgical base in the Soviet East was established under the leadership of the Communist Party in accordance with Stalin's plan. It played an important role in the development of the Soviet national economy and in the struggle for the victory of the Great Patriotic War. The great Stalin's genius of foresight, grand vision, and wisdom is expressed with new strength.
    Now, in the era of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the workers of the eastern coal and metallurgical base, like every Soviet people, are engaged in peaceful construction labor. The Kuznetsk and Magnitogorsk metallurgical scholars, the Kuzbas and Karaganda miners, the Ural and Siberian machine manufacturers, like all our workers, are selflessly struggling to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    The Kuznetsk Stalin Metallurgical Factory completed the steel and rail plan of the post-war Five-Year Plan in three years, and the pig iron production plan in three and a half years. The factory has achieved remarkable achievements in improving product quality and reducing costs. During the period of three years and nine months, 100 million rubles were saved by reducing product costs.
    Ninety-six percent of the workers, technicians, and staff of the Kuznetsk factory participated in the competition. The vanguard of production – Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members – are at the forefront of the competitors. The factory's Party organization leads the collective socialist competition, enhances and unites them to overcome difficulties, and further improves the output of high-quality metal. The factory's Communist Party members are the best example of labor, inspiring the entire factory to struggle for the completion and exceeding of the production plan with extensive organizational and political work among the masses.
    Thousands of Soviet factories, mines, and excavation sites are participating in socialist competition with the same enthusiasm. Many of our enterprises are also working with the same high productivity.
    Millions of working people are holding high the banner of competition to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. More than two thousand factories have already completed their Five-Year Plans ahead of schedule last year. The Magnitogorsk Stalin Metallurgical Factory occupies a glorious position among these factories. Under the leadership of the Communist Party organization, the Magnitogorsk metallurgists have already reached the planned 1950 production level in 1949. The iron, coking coal, and rail departments of the Magnitogorsk factory completed the Five-Year Plan in three years – while improving productivity.
    Socialist competition has reached a grand scale in all sectors of our industry. According to the Five-Year Plan, the total industrial output value in 1950 should exceed the pre-war level by 48 percent. But in June 1949 – one and a half years before the end of the Five-Year Plan, the daily average production of the total industrial output value had already exceeded the average pre-war level of 1940 by 41 percent.
    All these achievements are evidence of the great power of the socialist system, that is, the superiority over the capitalist system. Comrade Stalin instructed: "Our system – the Soviet system, gives us the possibility of rapid development, a possibility unimaginable for any bourgeois country."
    Soviet industrial production is constantly increasing, the achievements of socialist agriculture are expanding, and the material well-being of the people is improving. Conversely, in the capitalist world, the signs of a coming new economic crisis are becoming more obvious, the army of millions of unemployed is growing, and the living standards of the vast majority of workers are gradually declining.
    In the Soviet Union, the means of production are common social wealth. We do not and cannot have exploitation of man by man. The Soviet people work for themselves, for their beloved motherland.
    The socialist competition to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule is enabling our national economy to achieve new and even greater achievements.
    Although there are great achievements in industry, it is also wrong to only see the success of the advanced and not see the shortcomings. We still have some enterprises that have not completed the plan and are producing inferior products. Some factories only pay attention to the performance of the total production value, and do not follow the plan for product categories, thus hindering the production of machines and equipment necessary for the national economy. This situation cannot be allowed.
    The state plan is the immutable law for every factory and industrial sector, every mine and factory. The primary responsibility of Party, economic, and trade union organizations is to widely use the experience of advanced factories that have completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, so that there will be no backward enterprises in our industry.
    There are still more than two months before the end of the fourth year of the Five-Year Plan. In these two months, we should fight tenaciously to strive for the successful completion of the 1949 plan and the completion of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    Hold high the banner of the all-people socialist competition!
    We greet the upcoming 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution with new production achievements.

　　全人民竞赛的伟大力量
    ——真理报一九四九年十月二十五日社论
    （刘竟译）
    苏联人民以高度政治的与劳动的提高来迎接伟大的十月革命节三十二周年。苏联工人、农民、知识分子的生活充满着创造性的感召力，充满着争取提前完成战后斯大林五年计划的斗争。
    斯大林同志说过：社会主义竞赛是基于百万劳动群众的高度积极性的社会主义建设的共产主义方式。争取提前完成战后斯大林五年计划是具有全人民的本质，包括了十分之九以上的工人和职员。这个竞赛促进苏联生产的速度，加速我们迈向共产主义。
    斯大林同志说：“工人不是为资本家工作，而是为自己的国家，自己的阶级而工作的意识，是发展与改善我们工业最大原动力。”
    今天的“真理报”详述了库兹涅克的斯大林冶金联合工厂的动人的创造性的劳动。
    库兹涅茨克工厂是我国东部煤与冶金基地的一部分。斯大林同志在联共（布）十六次大会上曾指示：以各种方法发展乌克兰的燃料与冶金基地，而且必须立即开始创设第二个煤与冶金基地。这个基地应当是乌拉尔—库兹涅茨克联合工厂，即库兹涅茨克的焦煤与乌拉尔的矿藏的联合。”
    苏联东部雄伟的煤与冶金基地，在共产党领导之下依照斯大林的计划建立起来了。在苏联国民经济的发展上，在争取伟大的卫国战争胜利时，曾起过重要的作用。伟大的斯大林天才的预见、远大的眼光和智慧以新的力量表示出来了。
    现在战后五年计划的时代，东部的煤与冶金基地的劳动者也象每一个苏联人民一样从事于和平建设劳动。库兹涅茨克和马格尼托高尔斯克冶金学者，库兹巴斯和加拉干的矿工，乌拉尔和西比里机器制造师，也象我国所有的劳动者一样，忘我地为争取提前完成五年计划而斗争。
    库兹涅茨克的斯大林冶金工厂，三年中完成了战后五年计划的钢与铁轨的计划，三年半完成了铣铁生产计划。工厂在改善产品质量和降低成本方面达到了显著的成就。在三年零九个月的期间，因降低产品成本而节省下一亿卢布。
    库兹涅茨克工厂百分之九十六的工人、技师和职员都参加了竞赛。生产中的先锋队——共产党员和青年团员是在竞赛者的前列。工厂的党组织领导着集体的社会主义竞赛，提高并团结他们克服困难，进一步改进高等品质金属的产量。工厂的共产党员是劳动的最好榜样，以在群众中庞大的组织与政治工作来鼓舞全工厂为争取完成和超过生产计划而斗争。
    数千个苏联工厂、矿场和采掘场都以同样的积极性参加了社会主义竞赛。我们许多的企业也以也样的高度生产力工作着。
    百万劳动人民高举起争取提前完成五年计划的竞赛旗帜。二千个以上的工厂已经在去年提前完成了自己的五年计划。马格尼托高尔斯克的斯大林冶金工厂在这些工厂之中占有光荣的地位。马格尼托高尔斯克冶金者在共产党组织领导下，一九四九年即已达到了计划中的一九五○年的生产水平。马格尼托高尔斯克工厂的铁、焦煤、钢轨各部门，在三年中完成了五年计划——同时提高了生产率。
    社会主义竞赛在我们工业的各部门里，都达到雄阔的范围。依照五年计划的工业生产总额，在一九五○年应超过战前水平的百分之四十八。但在一九四九年六月——距五年计划终了时还有一年半，工业生产总额的每天平均生产，已超过战前一九四○年平均水平的百分之四十一。
    所有这些成就都是社会主义制度伟大力量的证据，也就是优于资本主义制度的证据。斯大林同志指示：“我们的制度——苏维埃制度，给与我们迅速发展的可能性，这个可能性为任何一个资产阶级国家所不能想到的。”
    苏联工业生产品在不断地增长，社会主义农业的成就在扩大，人民的物质幸福在提高。相反地，在资本主义的世界里，即将来临的新经济危机的征兆更为明显，数百万的失业军在增长着，广大劳动的生活水平逐渐地下降着。
    在苏联，生产手段是共同的社会财富。我们没有而且也不可能有人对人的剥削。苏联人民为自己、为自己可爱的祖国而工作。
    争取提前完成战后五年计划的社会主义竞赛，使我们的国民经济达到新而又新的成就。
    工业虽有伟大的成就，然而仅看见先进者的成功，而看不见缺点也是不对的。我们还有一些没有完成计划的企业，出产着劣质的生产品。有些工厂只注意执行生产总额的表现，没有遵行产品类别的计划，因之阻滞对国民经济必需的机器和设备的生产。这种情形是不能允许的。
    国家的计划对于每一个工厂和工业部门，每一个矿场和工厂是不变的法律。党的、经济的和职工会组织的首要责任，即广泛地利用提前完成了五年计划的先进工厂的经验，这样在我们的工业里，就不会存在有一个落后的企业了。
    五年计划至第四年终了还有两个多月，在这两个月中应顽强地斗争以争取一九四九年计划成功的完成，及提前完成五年计划。
    高举全人民社会主义竞赛旗帜！
    我们以新的生产成就来迎接即来将临的伟大十月社会主义革命节三十二周年。
