　　Regarding “Protecting the Rights of Asian Women”
    Summary of the Report by Iranian Representative Maxine Farrokh (Continued)
  　Women in the People's Republics
    Since 1922, the Mongolian People's Republic has rescued women from the most impoverished and despicable status. They have gained equal status with men. Now, women actively participate in the economic and cultural construction of the republic, practically enjoying all rights. Women have the right to vote and stand for election. They enjoy the rights to work, free education, social insurance, rest, and free medical care. Mothers and children are protected by law.
    Under the multiple oppressions of imperialism, feudalism, and comprador bourgeoisie, women in old China lived in the same enslavement and poverty as in all colonial countries. With the founding of the People's Republic of China, the status of 200 million women has undergone fundamental changes. Women have the right to vote and stand for election. In government organs at all levels, women actively participate in managing state affairs. Madam Sun Yat-sen holds the position of Vice Chairman of the government, two women serve as members of the government, and twenty-two women serve as ministers, vice ministers, and members of various government committees. Women actively participated in land reform, and they received the same share of land as men. Regarding female workers in factories, the resolutions of the National Labor Congress stipulate that female workers are guaranteed equal pay for equal work and the right to maternity leave for forty-five days before and after childbirth with full pay. Women have gained the right to education. Literacy classes and night schools have been established in cities and rural areas to eliminate illiteracy.
    Korea was reduced to a Japanese colony for thirty-six years. Terrible exploitation destroyed Korea's economic life and plunged the people into hunger and widespread poverty. Learning Korean was forbidden in schools. Women were in a lowly and oppressed position.
    Thanks to the assistance of the Soviet army and the struggle of the Korean people, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was successfully established.
    The people's regime of Korea recognizes all the rights of women. These rights have been realized in North Korea, where land reform has been implemented, opening up a new path of life for women. Here, 90 percent of women have eliminated illiteracy. Women receive their regular salaries during vacations, and there are also subsidies for illness, pregnancy, and mothers with many children.
    Currently, 90 percent of Vietnamese territory is under the administration of the People's Republic. The constitution declares that men and women are equal in all aspects, recognizes the people's democratic freedoms, enjoys free and compulsory primary education, and helps the elderly and those who have lost their ability to work. Women have the right to vote and stand for election. In rural areas, women receive their due share when public land is distributed. In production, the labor law is based on the principle of "equal pay for equal work" and stipulates maternity leave and family allowances. Although in wartime, eight million women have learned to read.
    Vietnamese women are fighting bravely and confidently for victory, which will bring their country independent, peaceful, democratic development and the realization of all rights.
    These examples indicate that only by completely defeating imperialism and its running dogs—various reactionary governments—in Asia can national independence be achieved, the people can gain freedom, and only under a democratic regime can women gain rights.
    Women in Asian countries have fought unyieldingly in the past, present, and will continue to do so in the future for national independence, women's liberation, and their own rights.
    The Tasks of Asian Women
    The elimination of old reactionary traditions and decadent feudal systems is not only a matter of time but also a matter of the degree of progress of countries that have embarked on the path of democracy. We call on the women of China, Korea, and Vietnam to use all their strength, all their activities, and creativity to support their people's governments, to increase production and promote social construction, which will enable us to obtain welfare and realize our rights in the near future.
    Women in liberated countries should always ensure their unity and provide all support to the struggles of millions of oppressed sisters.
    The conference sincerely points out to the women who are still suffering from imperialist and feudal oppression that the basic task of these sisters is to overthrow imperialism and its running dogs. They should do everything possible to achieve this sacred goal. Their responsibility is to participate in the national liberation war together with all the people. They should devote all their strength to educating, uniting, and winning over the broad masses of women, female workers, peasant women, female staff members, female intellectual workers, and progressive bourgeois women to participate in the struggle for freedom, for political, economic, family, and social rights, and to liberate themselves forever from the state of slavery.
    In order to strengthen the combativeness of women and to win their participation in the struggle to defend their own rights, we call on women to establish various women's own organizations and to expand all organizations that truly fight against imperialism and strive for the right to life, freedom, and peace.
    It should be understood that the struggle of women around the world for freedom, democracy, and peace is indivisible and inseparable from the struggle against imperialism—the creator of poverty and the instigator of war. We call on Asian women and all women's organizations to support the World Federation of Trade Unions, to organize women to participate in the Women's International Democratic Federation, an organization that unites all women and mothers who are fighting for their own urgent rights, for the rights of their children, and for happiness, equality, and peace throughout the world.
    We call on you to warmly greet International Women's Day—March 8th—to show that women in every country are united in the common demands and struggles of female workers, women, and mothers around the world.
    Asian women!
    Let us unite in the struggle to win our rights. Let us strive for the victory of freedom and people's democracy, for the complete elimination of imperialism in Asia!

　　关于“保护亚洲妇女权利”
    伊朗代表玛辛·法洛琪报告摘要（完续）
  　人民共和国的妇女
    蒙古人民共和国从一九二二年起，就把妇女从最贫困与最卑鄙的地位拯救了出来。她们已经获得了和男人一样的平等地位。现在妇女们积极地参加共和国的经济与文化的建设，实际享受到一切权利。妇女们有选举权与被选举权，她们享有劳动、免费教育、社会保险、休息、免费诊疗的权利。母亲与儿童受着法律的保护。
    旧中国的妇女，在帝国主义、封建主义、买办资产阶级的重重压迫下，生活在一切殖民地国家所同有的奴役与贫困之中。随着中华人民共和国的成立，两万万妇女的地位有了根本的改变。妇女有选举权与被选举权。在各级政权机构中，妇女们积极参加管理国事。孙中山夫人荣任政府的副主席，二位妇女做了政府的委员，二十二位妇女担任了部长、副部长等以及政府各委员会的委员。妇女积极参加了土地改革，她们分得了与男人们同等的一份土地。对于在工厂中的女工们，全国劳动大会的决议规定：保证女工享受同工同酬，产期前后四十五天内休假并照领工资的权利。妇女们获得受教育权。在城市与农村中成立了扫除文盲的识字班和夜校。
    朝鲜曾沦为日本的殖民地三十六年，可怕的剥削破坏了朝鲜的经济生活，并使人民陷入饥饿与普遍的贫困中。在学校中禁止学习朝鲜语文。妇女们处在卑贱的与被压迫的地位。
    由于苏联军队的帮助和朝鲜人民的斗争，胜利地树立了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    朝鲜的人民政权，承认了妇女的一切权利。这些权利在朝鲜北部已经实现，这里实行了土地改革，给妇女们开辟了一条新的生活的道路。这里百分之九十的妇女消灭了文盲。妇女们在休假期间照常领薪资，此外对疾病，怀妊及多子的母亲另有补助费。
    目前百分之九十的越南领土，是在人民共和国的管理之下。宪法宣布各方面的男女都是平等的，并承认人民的民主自由，享受免费义务初等教育，帮助年老的人们与失去劳动能力的人们。妇女有选举权及被选举权。在农村里分配公共土地时，妇女们得到她应得的一份。在生产中劳动法是基于“同工同酬”的原则，并规定着怀妊休假与家庭的补助费。虽然在战争中，八百万妇女学会了读书。
    越南妇女英勇地和满怀信心地为争取胜利而斗争，这个胜利会带给她们的国家以独立、和平、民主的发展和一切权利的实现。
    这些例子指示我们，只有把在亚洲的帝国主义及其走狗们——各反动政府完全击溃，才能获得民族独立，人民才能得到自由，只有在民主政权下妇女们才能得到权利。
    亚洲各国妇女们，为民族独立、妇女解放和自身权利，在过去、现在以至将来，始终不屈不挠的进行斗争。
    亚洲妇女的任务
    旧的反动传统及腐朽的封建制度之被消灭，不仅是时间问题，而且是已走上民主大道的各国之进步程度问题。我们号召中国、朝鲜及越南的妇女把自己的全部力量、全部活动及创造力，用来支持自己的人民政府，用来提高生产及推进社会建设，这就使得我们能够在最近期间得到福利并实现自己的权利。
    已解放国家的妇女应该经常保证本身的团结，并对千百万受压迫的姐妹们的斗争给予一切支援。
    代表会议竭诚地向尚遭受帝国主义与封建压迫的妇女指出，这些姊妹们的基本任务是打倒帝国主义及其走狗。她们应当尽一切力量达到这个神圣的目标。她们的责任是与全体人民在一起参加民族解放战争。她们应该将全部力量用于教育、团结及争取广大妇女群众、女工、农妇、女职员、女智力劳动者及进步资产阶级妇女，参加争取自由、争取政治、经济、家庭及社会权利的斗争，争取永远地从奴隶的状态中解放出来。
    为了加强妇女的战斗性及争取她们参加保卫自身权利的斗争，我们号召妇女们成立各种各样妇女自己的组织，并扩大一切真正为反对帝国主义，争取生活权利，自由与和平的组织。
    应当了解，全世界妇女争自由、民主及争取和平的斗争是不能分割的，它与反对帝国主义——穷困的制造者及战争挑拨者的斗争分不开的。我们号召亚洲妇女及一切妇女团体支援世界工联，组织在批妇女参加国际民主妇女联合会，这个组织团结了所有为争取自身迫切的权利，争取自己子女的权利，争取幸福、平等及全世界的和平而斗争的妇女及母亲们。
    我们号召热烈地迎接国际妇女节——三月八日，这样来表现出每个国家的妇女，都团结在全世界女工、妇女与母亲们的共同要求与斗争中。
    亚洲的妇女们！
    让我们在争取我们的权利的斗争中团结起来。让我们为自由与人民民主的胜利，为彻底消灭在亚洲的帝国主义努力而斗争！
