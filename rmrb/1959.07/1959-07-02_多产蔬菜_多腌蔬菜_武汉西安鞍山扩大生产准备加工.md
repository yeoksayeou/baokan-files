Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 30th: Wuhan City recently decided to expand the vegetable planting area of its existing two vegetable production bases. At the same time, based on favorable soil and water conditions, convenient transportation, and vegetable growing habits, it designated some commune management areas or production teams as new vegetable production bases. These new bases are located in Wuchang, Hanyang, Hanchuan, Xiaogan, Jiayu, Huangpi, Yunmeng, and Yingcheng, eight counties that have been placed under the leadership of Wuhan City. This will bring the area of land producing vegetables for the people of Wuhan to 180,000 mu, an increase of approximately two times compared to last year. In addition, there are more than 30,000 mu of aquatic vegetable land and 60,000 mu of land for single-season vegetables. Averaged over the entire city population, this is about one fen of vegetable land per person.

Wuhan City implemented a "six fixes" method for the management areas or production teams designated as new bases, specifically fixing the location of the garden, the planting area, the labor force, the varieties, the yield, and the amount to be marketed. At the same time, vegetable production units are required to stagger the planting times for twenty major vegetables in batches to keep the vegetable gardens evergreen all year round, so that citizens can eat fresh vegetables in all seasons. Vegetable management departments or vegetable production bases also plan to pickle and store a batch of vegetables during peak season when vegetable production is high, in order to ensure supply during the off-season.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 30th: Xi'an suburban areas are recently marketing more than one million catties of fresh vegetables daily, an increase of one-third compared to the same period last year, with the variety of marketed vegetables gradually increasing to more than twenty. City residents have already been able to eat seasonal vegetables such as eggplant, tomatoes, and cucumbers.

The city's vegetable processing plants are now busy pickling vegetables to prepare for winter supply. Each factory has added more than 10,000 pickling vats and increased the number of technical personnel. In the past ten days or so, they have pickled more than 500,000 catties of pickled vegetables and preserved vegetables.

Since the spring of this year, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee have strengthened leadership over vegetable production in all aspects. The city has sown more than 110,000 mu of vegetables in the past five months (excluding the four counties under the city's jurisdiction), more than double the same period last year. The production teams in the suburban communes have generally implemented the principle of "staggered planting, phased harvesting, and balanced production" and strengthened field management of vegetables. As a result, vegetable production has developed rapidly.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 30th: The people's communes in the suburbs of Anshan City are actively implementing the principle of suburban production serving the city and are seizing the opportunity to increase vegetable production. Now the city's vegetable supply has increased compared to the past, and citizens can buy fresh vegetables such as cucumbers, kidney beans, tomatoes, and cabbage in vegetable markets and non-staple food stores. Since June, workers and citizens in the urban area have been able to eat an average of more than one catty of vegetables per person per day. The variety of vegetables has also increased from five to more than ten.

Anshan City, located in Northeast China, has a long cold season and a short vegetable production period, but the urban population is increasing rapidly. The suburban people's communes fully considered this characteristic when arranging vegetable production plans and paid attention to the balance of supply throughout the year while increasing production. They proposed to sow in phases to stagger the time of vegetable marketing in the future. In winter, they plan to vigorously develop greenhouse production. Commercial departments are also actively organizing the transfer and storage of commercial vegetables, helping production brigades and food units with insufficient transportation capacity to transport vegetables, and carrying out the storage of fresh vegetables and the processing of salted vegetables and dried vegetables to ensure the supply in the off-season.

    多产蔬菜　多腌蔬菜
    武汉西安鞍山扩大生产准备加工
    新华社武汉30日电　武汉市最近决定扩大原有两个蔬菜生产基地的蔬菜播种面积，同时根据土质水利好、运输方便、有种菜习惯等条件，划定一些公社的管理区或生产队，作为新的蔬菜生产基地。这些新基地分别设在已划归武汉市领导的武昌、汉阳、汉川、孝感、嘉鱼、黄陂、云梦、应城等八个县里。这样，常年生产蔬菜供应武汉城市人民的蔬菜土地，就达到了十八万亩，比去年约增加两倍；此外，还有三万多亩水生蔬菜地和六万亩只种一季的菜地。按全市人口平均计算，每人约有一分菜地。
    武汉市对被划为新基地的管理区或生产队，实行了“六定”的办法，即把园地地点、播种面积、劳动力、花色品种、产量和上市量都具体定下来。同时，要求蔬菜生产单位对二十种大宗蔬菜，排开时间，分批播种，保持菜园四季常青，使市民四季都能吃到鲜菜。蔬菜管理部门或蔬菜生产基地在旺季蔬菜出产多的时候，还准备腌制、储备一批蔬菜，以备淡季供应。
    新华社西安30日电　西安市郊区新鲜蔬菜最近每天上市一百多万斤，比去年同期增加三分之一，上市品种陆续增加到二十多种。市区居民已经吃到了茄子、西红柿和黄瓜等时鲜菜。
    全市的蔬菜加工厂现在正忙着腌制蔬菜，为冬季供应作准备。各厂已添置一万多口腌菜缸，增加了技术人员，最近十天多来已腌制泡菜和酱菜五十多万斤。
    中共西安市委和市人民委员会从今年春天以来，从各方面加强了对蔬菜生产的领导。全市五个多月来播种蔬菜十一万多亩（不包括市属四个县），比去年同期增加一倍多。郊区公社各生产队在生产上大都贯彻了“排开播种，分期收获，均衡生产”的原则，同时加强了对蔬菜的田间管理。因此，蔬菜生产发展很快。
    新华社鞍山30日电　鞍山市郊区各人民公社积极贯彻郊区生产为城市服务的方针，抓紧蔬菜生产。现在全市蔬菜供应量已经比过去增加，市民可以在蔬菜市场、副食品商店买到黄瓜、芸豆、西红柿、白菜等新鲜蔬菜。6月份以来，市区职工和市民平均每人每天已能吃到一斤多菜。蔬菜的品种也由不久前的五种增加到十多种。
    位于我国东北的鞍山市，寒冷季节较长，蔬菜生产期短，但是城市人口增加较快。郊区人民公社在安排蔬菜生产计划时充分估计到了这个特点，在抓增产的同时，还注意全年供应的平衡。他们提出要分期播种，使将来蔬菜上市时间错开；冬季准备大力发展温室生产。商业部门也在积极组织商品菜的调运和贮藏工作，一面帮助运输能力不足的生产大队和食用单位运送蔬菜，一面开展了贮藏鲜菜和加工咸菜、干菜等工作，以保证淡季的供应。（附图片）
