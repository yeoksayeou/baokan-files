Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th: The Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine has improved its tunneling efficiency and increased its effective tunneling footage, ensuring an increase in coal production. The daily coal production in early July increased by more than 200 tons compared to the average daily production in June.

The high-quality coking coal produced by Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine is supplied to many key iron and steel enterprises. In the past two years, the mine's coal production has grown rapidly. However, in the past, there was a tendency to simply pursue footage in tunneling. As a result, some roadways that should not have been tunneled were, while roadways that urgently needed to be tunneled were not. Although the total footage was considerable, the number of coal mining faces prepared was not enough, which affected the further improvement of coal production.

In order to change this situation, Xishan Coal Mine held a series of meetings to clarify among its employees the idea that tunneling must prepare conditions for coal mining. At the same time, the original large tunneling teams were divided into smaller ones, fixed tunneling roadways were implemented, and single-hole tunneling was practiced. This not only avoided disorderly tunneling and mining and wasted work hours, but also greatly strengthened the workers' sense of responsibility. A competition quickly developed between roadways and between teams, and the atmosphere of mutual learning and promotion of advanced experience greatly increased. In June, the number of tunneling workers in the entire mining area did not increase, but they tunneled 457 meters more than in May, averaging 126 meters per roadway, exceeding the prescribed target. Among them, three tunneling teams, each with 15 to 18 people, tunneled more than 320 meters per month in roadways with gangue and water, more than the number of meters tunneled by more than 100 people in the past. The effective tunneling footage of the entire mine increased by nearly one time compared to the past, equivalent to adding more than 100 tunneling workers.

At present, the situation in the mining area where tunneling cannot keep up with coal mining has begun to improve. In April and May, the coal mining faces prepared by the entire mining area were only enough for three and a half months of mining, but now they are sufficient for six months.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th: Jiaozuo Mining Bureau rectified its labor organization, improved its enterprise management level, and overfulfilled the state plan by more than 4,000 tons in June. The first-half production plan was also completed ten days ahead of schedule, and raw coal production increased by 68.63% compared to the same period last year.

Starting at the end of May, the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau universally rectified the labor organization within the entire bureau, basically eliminating the phenomenon of overstaffing and wasted work hours. Combined with the rectification of the labor organization, it also promoted 18 advanced experiences related to coal mining and tunneling, which increased labor efficiency in June by 5.52% compared to May. Among them, Wangfeng Mine's full-member efficiency in June reached 1.946 tons, an increase of 26.62% compared to May.

In June, each mine transferred a portion of personnel to strengthen production preparation work centered on tunneling, and the prepared recoverable coal volume could supply coal mining for more than six months, basically ensuring the normal succession of coal mining faces. Each mine also strengthened roadway repair work, which improved mine ventilation and transportation conditions.

In order to ensure that production is carried out evenly and rhythmically, each mine has also strengthened enterprise management and extensively mobilized workers to speak out freely, establishing and supplementing and revising more than 4,800 rules and regulations based on mass opinions.

### 乘胜前进打响三季度第一炮  太原西山煤矿日产量上升  焦作煤矿提前十天完成上半年计划

    乘胜前进打响三季度第一炮
    太原西山煤矿日产量上升
    焦作煤矿提前十天完成上半年计划
    新华社太原6日电　太原西山煤矿提高掘进效率，增加掘进有效进尺，保证了产煤量的上升。7月初的每日产煤量，比6月份的平均日产量增加了两百多吨。
    太原西山煤矿生产的优质主焦煤，供应许多重点钢铁企业。近两年来，这个矿的产煤量增长很快。但是以往在掘进中存在着单纯追求进尺的倾向。结果，一些不该掘进的巷道掘进了，而急需掘进的巷道反而没有掘进，虽然总的进尺数不少，但是准备出的采煤工作面不多，因而影响了产煤量的进一步提高。
    西山煤矿为了改变这种状况，曾召开了一系列会议，在职工中明确掘进必须为采煤准备条件的思想。同时将原来的大掘进组划小，固定掘进巷道，实行单孔掘进。这样，不仅避免了乱掘乱采和窝工浪费现象，工人们的责任心也大大加强。巷道与巷道，组与组之间很快展开了竞赛，互相学习和推广先进经验的风气大为增长。6月份，全矿区掘进人数没有增加，却比5月份多掘进了四百五十七公尺，平均每个巷道达到一百二十六公尺，超过了规定指标。其中有三个掘进队，每队十五人到十八人，在有夹石有水的巷道里月进三百二十多公尺，比原来一百多人掘进一个月的米数还要多。全矿有效掘进进尺比过去增加将近一倍，等于增加了一百多个掘进工人。
    目前这个矿区掘进赶不上采煤的局面已开始好转。4、5月份全矿区准备出的采煤工作面只够开采三个半月，现在可以够开采半年。
    新华社郑州6日电　焦作矿务局整顿劳动组织，提高企业管理水平，6月份超额四千多吨完成了国家计划。上半年生产计划也提前十天完成，原煤产量比去年同期提高68.63％。
    从5月底起，焦作矿务局就在全局范围内普遍地整顿了劳动组织，基本上消灭了人浮于事和窝工浪费现象，结合整顿劳动组织，还推广了十八项有关采煤和掘进的先进经验，使6月份的劳动效率比5月份提高5.52％。其中王封矿6月份全员效率达到一点九四六吨，比5月份提高了26.62％。
    6月份，各矿抽调了一部分人员加强了以掘进为中心的生产准备工作，准备的获得煤量可供采煤六个多月，基本上保证了采煤工作面的正常接替。各矿还加强了巷道修理工作，使矿井通风和运输情况有所改善。
    为了保证生产均衡地有节奏地进行，各矿还加强了企业管理，广泛发动职工大鸣大放，根据群众意见建立和补充修改了四千八百多条规章制度。
