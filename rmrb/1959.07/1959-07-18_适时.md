    Timely

    Early rice must be harvested in a timely manner. If it is not timely—too early or too late—it will not be possible to recover all of the bumper harvest. Look at how convincing the experiment of the Dongtingwei Commune in Xiangyin County is: even if the rice is harvested only two days early, one mu will yield thirty jin less grain.

    In order to ensure the timely harvesting of early rice, the practices of Xiangyin and Hengnan counties are very good: first, they do not arbitrarily advance the opening of the sickle; second, they do not rigidly prescribe a unified date for rush harvesting, but rather allow production teams and work groups to study and decide based on the specific circumstances; third, leading cadres go deep into the fields and conduct joint investigations and studies with the masses to determine the harvest time and sequence of each field. In this way, it is truly done in a timely manner, ensuring that all of the increased grain is recovered.

    适时
    早稻要适时收割，不适时——过早或过晚了，就不能把丰产的粮食全部收回来。你看，湘阴县洞庭围公社的试验多么使人信服，那怕稻子仅仅早收两天，一亩地就要少打粮食三十斤。
    为了保证早稻适时收割，湘阴、衡南两县的作法就很好：第一，他们不随意提早开镰；第二，不硬性规定统一的抢收日期，由生产队、作业组根据具体情况研究决定；第三，领导干部深入田间，和群众共同调查研究，确定每块田的收割时间和先后次序。这样，便做到了真正切合时宜，保证把增产的粮食全部收回来。
