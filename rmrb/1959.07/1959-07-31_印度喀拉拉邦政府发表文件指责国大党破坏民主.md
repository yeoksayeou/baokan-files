Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 29 - The Kerala State Government of India published its reply on the 28th to the memorandum of the Kerala State Committee of the Congress Party. Copies of the reply have been sent to Prime Minister Nehru and Kerala State Governor Rao.

In a memorandum submitted to the President of India on July 9, the Kerala State Committee of the Congress Party accused the Kerala State Government of "undermining democracy" and demanded that the President take measures to prompt new elections in Kerala, etc.

The 55-page reply stated that the Kerala State Government is acting within the scope of constitutional provisions, and it has formulated democratic policies and protected laborers, safeguarding their rights from infringement by vested interest groups.

In response to the accusation of "undermining democracy," the reply stated that the Congress Party could have filed a lawsuit against the state government's specific actions in the High Court or requested the Federal Cabinet to take appropriate measures based on relevant provisions in the Constitution. The reply said, "Instead of following this direct constitutional procedure, they adopted the completely unreasonable and unconstitutional step of launching direct action."

The reply pointed out that the Congress Party "launched this direct action, even openly declaring that they would paralyze the (Kerala State) government in a few weeks—if not days. If anyone is to be accused of committing the crime of undermining democracy, it is the Kerala State Committee of the Congress Party and its patrons throughout India, who should be accused of attempting to paralyze the (Kerala State) government. Isn't this clear?"

Regarding the Kerala Congress Party's demand for new general elections in Kerala, the reply stated that this demand is based on the unfounded assumption that public opinion in the state has greatly changed. The reply said that there is no evidence to prove this, and the results of various by-elections conducted in the past two years show that support for the government is increasing.

    印度喀拉拉邦政府发表文件指责国大党破坏民主
    据新华社新德里29日电　喀拉拉邦政府在28日发表了它对国大党喀拉拉邦委员会的备忘录的答复。答复的副本已经送交尼赫鲁总理和喀拉拉邦邦长拉奥。
    国大党喀拉拉邦委员会在7月9日交给印度总统的一项备忘录中，指责喀拉拉邦政府“破坏民主”，并且要求总统采取措施来促使喀拉拉邦重新举行选举等。
    长达五十五页的答复说，喀拉拉邦政府是在宪法条款的范围内活动的，它制定了民主的政策和保护劳动者，使他们的权利免受既得利益集团的侵犯。
    答复在回答所谓“破坏民主”的指责时说，国大党原可以对邦政府的具体行动向高等法院提出控诉，可以通过联邦内阁要求总统根据宪法中有关的条款采取适当的措施。答复说，“他们不是通过这种直接的宪法程序，而是采用了发动直接行动这种完全无理的不合宪法的步骤。”
    答复指出，国大党“发动了这次直接行动，甚至公然宣称，他们将在几个星期中——如果不是在几天内——使（喀拉拉邦）政府陷于瘫痪。如果要指责谁犯了破坏民主的罪行，那就是国大党喀拉拉邦委员会和它在全印度的赞助人，他们应当被指责企图使（喀拉拉邦）政府陷于瘫痪，这难道不清楚吗？”
    答复在谈到喀拉拉邦国大党关于在喀拉拉邦重新举行普选的要求时说，这个要求是以这样一个毫无根据的假定为基础的：邦内人民的意见有了很大的改变。答复说，并没有证据证明这一点，在过去两年中所进行的各次补缺选举的结果表明，对于政府的支持正在增加中。
