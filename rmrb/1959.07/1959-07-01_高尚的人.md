    Noble People

    Today we report on the deeds of two Communist Party members. One is Chen Bin, a mechanical and electrical installation team leader who bravely undertakes the most difficult work, and the other is Li Fenghua, a salesperson who diligently serves the people.

    These two people stand in two different work positions, and their deeds have their own characteristics; but they have a common point, that is, a high degree of responsibility for their work. During the storm and flood, rushing to transport the belt conveyor was the most dangerous and difficult task, and that was exactly where Chen Bin took the lead in working; many people looked down on commercial work and service work, but Li Fenghua was full of enthusiasm to do it, and she strived for excellence, delving deeply and achieving extraordinary results. Such people are people with lofty ideals and noble qualities.

    We must learn from their spirit of high responsibility and abandon the ideas of seeking comfort and fearing difficulty, and being preoccupied with personal gains and losses, so that we can move forward lightly.

    高尚的人
    今天我们报道了两个共产党员的事迹。一个是勇于承担最困难的工作的机电安装队长陈斌，一个是勤勤恳恳为人民服务的售货员李凤华。
    这两个人站在两个不同的工作岗位上，他们的事迹各有各的特点；但他们有个共同点，就是对工作有高度的责任心。在暴风雨和洪水冲击下，抢运皮带输送机，原是最危险、最困难的，那里正是陈斌带头工作的场所；商业工作、服务工作，许多人都看不起，李凤华却满腔热情地去干，而且精益求精，深入钻研，做出了超乎寻常的成绩。这样的人才是有高尚理想的人、有高贵品质的人。
    要学习他们的高度负责精神，摒弃那些图安逸怕困难，斤斤计较个人得失的思想，才会轻装前进。
