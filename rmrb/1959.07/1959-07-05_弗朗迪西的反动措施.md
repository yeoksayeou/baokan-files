Frondizi's Reactionary Measures

Argentine President Arturo Frondizi was elected president in the February 1958 general election as the presidential candidate of the "Intransigent Radical Civic Union." During the campaign, he put forward a campaign program that was more in line with the people's demands, such as advocating for safeguarding national resources, developing national industry, implementing land reform, guaranteeing trade union freedom and unity, expanding foreign trade, and implementing a foreign policy of peaceful coexistence. However, after taking office last May, he abandoned his campaign program and implemented policies that were not in the national interest.

Under the pressure of U.S. imperialism and domestic reactionaries, Frondizi adopted a policy of compromise and concession. First, he signed contracts with American oil companies to sell out Argentina's oil rights. At the end of last December, in order to obtain a loan of 329 million U.S. dollars from the "International Monetary Fund" and American banks, he agreed to implement a disastrous "economic stabilization plan" domestically according to U.S. conditions.

He also took a series of anti-communist and anti-people measures. Since last November, Argentina has been under martial law, conducting nationwide arrests, and prisons are filled with trade union leaders and communists. He also promulgated decrees prohibiting communist activities, closed the Communist Party headquarters, local party offices, and party newspapers, and suppressed the strike movement with military mobilization.

These reactionary measures of the Frondizi government have aroused opposition from the broad masses of people from all walks of life. The strike movement swept the country. According to statistics, 268 strikes occurred from February to May this year. The "People's Radical Civic Union," one of Argentina's largest bourgeois parties, issued a statement accusing Frondizi of being "the mouthpiece of the ruling political oligarchy closely linked to American capital," saying that his government had abandoned its party's campaign program. Even within the ruling "Intransigent Radical Civic Union," there was widespread opposition to Frondizi's current policies. According to the "Razón" newspaper, a large number of party members have recently resigned from the party due to dissatisfaction with the government's policies. Senator García, chairman of the Union, also believes that "our government is implementing a clearly unpopular plan," and "this plan separates us from the masses of people who supported us on February 23."

    弗朗迪西的反动措施
    阿根廷总统弗朗迪西在1958年2月大选中作为“不妥协激进公民联盟”总统候选人当选总统。竞选时他提出一个比较符合人民要求的竞选纲领，如主张保卫国家资源；发展民族工业；实行土地改革；保证工会自由和统一，扩大对外贸易，实行和平共处的外交政策等。但是他在去年5月就任后却背弃他的竞选纲领，执行不符合民族利益的政策。
    弗朗迪西在美帝国主义及国内反动派的压力下，采取了妥协退让的政策。首先，同美国石油公司签订出卖阿根廷石油权益的合同。去年12月底，为了取得“国际货币基金组织”以及美国银行的三亿二千九百万美元的贷款，又同意按照美国的条件在国内实施灾难性的“稳定经济计划”。
    他还采取了一系列反共反人民的措施。从去年11月以来，阿根廷一直处于戒严状态，进行全国性的逮捕，监狱里关满了工会领袖和共产党人，他并颁布禁止共产党活动的法令，封闭共产党总部、党的地方办事处和党报，用军事动员的手段镇压罢工运动。
    弗朗迪西政府的这些反动措施，引起了广大各阶层人士的反对，罢工运动席卷全国，据统计，今年2月到5月共发生了二百六十八次罢工。阿根廷最大的资产阶级政党之一“人民激进公民联盟”发表声明指责弗朗迪西“是同美国资本有紧密联系的执政的政治寡头的喉舌”，说他的政府背弃了自己党的竞选纲领。甚至在执政党“不妥协激进公民联盟”内部也纷纷反对弗朗迪西的现行政策。据“理性报”报道，这个政党最近有大批党员因不满政府的政策而退党。联盟的主席、参议员加西亚也认为，“我们的政府执行着一个显然不得人心的计划”，“这个计划使我们脱离2月23日支持我们的人民群众”。
