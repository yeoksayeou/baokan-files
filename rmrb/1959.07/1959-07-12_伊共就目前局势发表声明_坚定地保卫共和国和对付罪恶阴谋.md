Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 10th. The Political Bureau of the Iraqi Communist Party issued a statement on the evening of July 9th regarding the current situation, saying: The Iraqi Communist Party declares that,
    "It unconditionally places all its capabilities and strength at the disposal of the revolutionary government to defend the Republic and to counter the threat and danger of conspiracies and aggression."

    The statement said that the Iraqi Communist Party held two meetings on July 8th and 9th. The Political Bureau, after studying the situation, decided to issue this statement. The statement said that the Iraqi Communist Party's "firm plan is to defend the Republic and the leadership of Qasim, and to use weapons against any evil conspiracy, no matter how vicious it is, and no matter how much effort and sacrifice is required."

    The statement said, "In the past few months, our heroic Republic has pursued a free and patriotic policy, which is based on: first, a firm attitude towards imperialists and their collaborators, as well as other enemies of the Republic; second, gradually granting the people democratic rights and freedoms."

    The statement emphasized that "this policy has provided the necessary conditions for consolidating the unity of the people from all classes and nationalities, for strengthening the unity between the army and the people, and for uniting all loyal national forces around the revolutionary government and its leader."

    The statement pointed out that in the past few months, the Party, together with other national forces, has supported the revolutionary government and leader Qasim in opposing subversion and conspiracies against the Republic.

    The statement pointed out that consolidated unity has enabled the Republic to achieve greater victories, but at the same time, it has alarmed the imperialists and enemies of the revolution, causing them to concentrate their efforts on weakening the unity of national forces, thereby undermining the unity of the people and the army, as well as the unity of the masses. The statement said, "Therefore, in the past few weeks, imperialists and their agents have launched a frantic campaign: fabricating conspiracies, spreading slander, creating discord among national forces, and inciting them to fight each other, in order to ultimately undermine the trust between the people and the government and create suspicion between them."

    The statement pointed out that they used the method of slandering communists and distorting their position and policies of supporting the revolutionary government and its leader to expand the divisions within the national ranks. The statement emphasized that, regrettably, they "have succeeded in deceiving certain national forces, which has enabled them to continue their activities in order to make the leadership of the regime suspect the correct stance of the democratic forces and democratic elements, and even the most loyal sons of the army, Qasim's comrades-in-arms.

    The statement said that the current "situation is becoming increasingly serious, and a new factor has emerged due to the excessively lenient policy towards reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries, and falling into the trap of inciting against democratic forces and democratic elements. Reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries have ignited the flames of disputes and conflicts, and carry out provocations and slander against the policies of the Communist Party and other democratic forces, using this as part of a conspiracy to gradually bring the government into conflict with the masses of the people and national forces, and finally pave the way for attacking the state power and Qasim himself."

    The statement said: "Our Party believes that, especially in the current situation, it is necessary to adopt a firm policy, remove all reactionaries and suspected elements from important state departments, and adopt a firm policy towards the enemies of the revolution."

    The statement pointed out that "the Party's position on certain fundamental issues can never weaken its unity with the revolutionary government, nor can it affect the Party's policy, which is based on the solid foundation of unity with the government within the scope of major common national goals. As a political force with a standing and reputation among the broad masses of the people, our Party believes that it is necessary to express its views on any political issues related to the interests of the people, and to provide solutions to all problems—solutions that the Party believes are correct and consistent with defending the Republic and the achievements of the revolution."

    The statement also said that the Iraqi Communist Party's attitude towards the issue of mobilizing the people and uniting their ranks, namely, the issue of organizing a national united front and the continued activities of political parties, is well known, and it does not believe that organizing a national united front and the continued activities of political parties are contrary to the situation in the transition period. The statement emphasized that the Communist Party's adoption of these independent attitudes aimed at expanding the people's achievements is its absolute right.

    The statement pointed out that the Party supports the government and the leadership of Qasim because they are anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and fighting for the interests of the people.

    The statement pointed out that the Iraqi Communist Party believes that it is necessary to stop all attempts by the reactionaries to plunder the fruits of the revolution and deprive the people of their democratic rights, thereby avoiding the consequences of endangering the security of the Republic due to increasingly failing to investigate the conspiracies of imperialism and its lackeys.

    The statement reiterated that the Iraqi Communist Party, supported by the broadest strata of the masses, and united with other democratic forces in the country in an alliance of united front, together with its allies, is "the basic political force in the country, which the national government can rely on for sincere help to defend the Republic and make the Republic continue to advance victoriously on the road of freedom and democracy."

    The statement finally called on the masses to be vigilant, and warned the imperialists and traitors that the people, the Party, and the remaining national forces supporting the government and the army will crush all attempts to undermine the security of the Republic or the democratic achievements of the people.

    伊共就目前局势发表声明
    坚定地保卫共和国和对付罪恶阴谋
    新华社巴格达10日电　伊拉克共产党政治局9日晚上就目前局势发表声明说：伊拉克共产党宣布，
  “它无条件地把它的全部能力和力量交给革命政府支配以保卫共和国，对付阴谋和侵略的威胁和危险。”
    声明说，伊拉克共产党在7月8日和9日举行了两次会议。政治局在研究了局势后决定发表这一声明。声明说，伊拉克共产党的“坚定的计划是保卫共和国和卡塞姆的领导，用武器对付任何罪恶的阴谋，不论这种阴谋是多么凶恶，不论需要作出多大的努力和牺牲。”
  声明说，“在过去几个月中，我们英勇的共和国奉行了自由的、爱国的政策，这个政策的基础是：第一，对帝国主义者和他们的合作者以及其他的共和国的敌人采取坚定的态度；第二，逐步给人民以民主权利和自由。”
    声明强调指出，“这个政策为巩固各阶级、各民族的人民群众的团结，为加强军民团结以及使一切忠诚的民族力量团结在革命政府和它的领袖周围，提供了必要的条件。”
    声明指出，在过去几个月中，党同其他的民族力量一起支持革命政府和领袖卡塞姆，反对了颠覆和反对共和国的各项阴谋。
    声明指出，巩固的团结已经使得共和国能够取得更大的胜利，但是同时它也使帝国主义和革命的敌人着了慌，使得他们集中力量来削弱民族力量的团结，从而破坏人民和军队的团结以及群众的团结。声明说，“因此，在过去几周，帝国主义者及其代理人展开了疯狂的活动：制造阴谋，散布诽谤，在民族力量之间制造不和，并且煽动他们互相争斗，以便最后破坏人民同政府之间的信任并且在他们之间制造猜疑。”
    声明指出，他们使用诽谤共产党人并歪曲他们支持革命政府及其领袖的立场和政策的办法来扩大民族队伍的分裂。声明强调指出，令人遗憾的是：他们“在欺骗某些民族力量方面居然获得成功，这就使得他们会把活动继续下去，以便使政权的领导怀疑民主力量和民主分子，甚至怀疑陆军最忠诚的儿子，卡塞姆的战友的正确立场。
    声明说，目前的“局势越来越严重了，由于对反动分子和反革命分子执行过分宽大的政策，又产生了一个新的因素，并且落入了反对民主力量和反对民主分子的煽动的圈套。反动分子和反革命分子已经点起了争论和冲突的火焰，对共产党和其他民主力量的政策进行挑衅和诽谤，他们以此作为使政府逐渐同人民群众和民族力量冲突的诡计的一部分，最后为打击国家政权和卡塞姆本人铺平道路”。
    声明说：“我党认为，特别是在现在这样的情况下，有必要采取坚定的政策，把一切反动和嫌疑分子从重要国家部门中开除出去并对革命的敌人采取坚定的政策。”
    声明指出，“党在某些基本问题上的立场决不可能削弱它同革命政府的团结，也不可能影响党的政策，党的政策是建立在主要的共同民族目标范围内同政府团结这个牢固的基础上的。作为在广大的人民阶层中有地位和有声誉的一个政治力量，我们党认为有必要就任何有关人民利益的政治问题发表它的意见，并为一切问题提供解决办法——党认为是正确的、并且同保卫共和国和革命成果相一致的解决办法”。
    声明还说，对于动员人民和团结他们的队伍的问题，即组织民族统一阵线和政党继续活动的问题，伊拉克共产党的态度是大家都知道的，它并不认为，组织民族统一阵线和政党继续活动是同过渡时期的形势相抵触的。声明强调指出，共产党采取这些旨在扩大人民成果的独立态度，这是它的绝对权利。
    声明指出，党所以支持政府和卡塞姆的领导是因为它们是反帝、反封建和为人民的利益而奋斗的。
    声明指出，伊拉克共产党认为，必须制止反动派旨在掠夺革命成果和剥夺人民的民主权利的一切企图，从而避免由于愈来愈不追究帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋而产生的危害共和国安全的后果。
    声明重申，伊拉克共产党得到最广泛阶层群众的支持，它同国内其他民主力量团结在统一阵线的联盟中，它同它的同盟者一道，是“国内基本的政治力量，民族政府能够依靠它真诚的帮助来保卫共和国和使共和国在自由和民主的道路上继续胜利地前进。”
    声明最后呼吁群众提高警惕，并且警告帝国主义者和卖国贼说，人民、党和支持政府和军队的其余民族力量将粉碎企图破坏共和国安全或人民的民主成果的一切尝试。
