    Old Field Manager
    In a rice paddy of the Seventh Production Team of the Da Zonghu People's Commune in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, an old man is always busy in the fields from morning till night, either changing the water, or removing insects and weeding. This man is named Song Changchun, and he is fifty-seven years old this year, but he can work even better than a young man. Since the establishment of the advanced cooperative, he has been selected as the seedling field manager every year. People call him "Old Field Manager."
    To the west of the field managed by Song Changchun is the eighteen mu of high-yield fields managed by Production Team Leader Song Weibin. Team Leader Song is a young man in his twenties, with great enthusiasm and a down-to-earth work style. He always likes to consult Song Changchun when he encounters problems. Song Changchun also likes to talk to Team Leader Song when he has any problems that he can't solve. The two of them learn from each other and help each other.
    When the rice seedlings were growing, the seedlings in several fields turned yellow. Team Leader Song quickly came to Old Field Manager to discuss the matter. The two walked to the fields, and Song Changchun squatted down, looked at this piece and then at that piece, and then pointed to the seedlings and said, "This piece of land is low-lying, and water flows from the high fields to the low fields, with a high alkali content. Just change the water twice a day to flush out the alkali." Pointing to another piece of field, he said, "The base fertilizer was not applied evenly, and the places where the base fertilizer was not applied have turned yellow. We must quickly apply top dressing now."
    Team Leader Song immediately called a meeting of commune members to discuss the matter based on Old Field Manager's advice. After the meeting, they immediately took action, changing the water and applying top dressing. In a few days, all the seedlings in the team took off their "yellow robes" and put on "green robes."
    A few days later, on a pitch-black night, a thunderstorm woke Song Changchun from his dream. He climbed out of bed, put on a tattered rain hat, and rushed out the door. When he ran to the field, he quickly tested the depth of the water in the field with his hand, and then said to himself, "Fortunately! It hasn't flooded." Old Field Manager followed the ridge, opened the gaps in each field, and drained the excess water. Suddenly, he remembered the eighteen mu of high-yield fields managed by Team Leader Song, so he immediately walked to the team leader's field.
    Suddenly, a flash of lightning illuminated the earth. Old Field Manager saw a young man wearing a bamboo hat and a raincoat walking towards him on the ridge. "Is that Team Leader?" Song Changchun had already guessed eight or nine parts. From the other end of the ridge came the reply, "Uncle Changchun, it's me!"
    As soon as the team leader heard that it was Old Field Manager, he couldn't help but quicken his pace. He said with concern and reproach, "I told you a long time ago not to come to the fields in the middle of the night. Why are you here again?"
    Old Field Manager explained, "Look, it's raining so hard, how can I stay at home?"
    The team leader reached out and touched Old Field Manager's body, and said in surprise, "Oh dear! You're soaked all over. Quick! I'll take you back."
    "No! What does a little rain matter!" Old Field Manager said stubbornly, "Team Leader! You haven't had a good rest for a few days. You should go back first!"
    The two argued for a long time, neither willing to go back first. Finally, they reached a consensus: help others drain the excess water from the seedling fields, and then go back together.

    老田长
    在江苏盐城县大纵湖公社第七生产队的一丘稻田里，每天从早到晚，总有一个老人在田间忙碌着，不是在换水，就是在除虫、拔草。这个人，叫宋长春，今年五十七了，可是干起活来还能赛过小伙子。自从成立高级社以来，他每年都被选为秧田管理员。人们都叫他“老田长”。
    在宋长春管理的那丘田西边，是生产队长宋维斌管理的十八亩丰产田。宋队长是个二十来岁的小伙子，干劲大，作风踏实，遇事总喜欢请教宋长春。宋长春心里有什么疙瘩解不开，也爱找宋队长谈谈。他们俩个人互相学习，互相帮助。
    当秧苗正在生长的时候，有几块田里的秧苗发黄。宋队长连忙来找老田长商量。两个人走到田边，宋长春蹲下来，看看这块又看看那块，然后指着秧苗说：“这块田地势低，高田往低田内流水，碱气大，只要每天换两次水，冲冲碱气就行了。”指着另一块田说：“基肥下得不匀，没下到基肥的地方就发黄了，现在要赶快追肥。”
    宋队长根据老田长的意见，马上召集社员开会讨论。会后立即行动起来，换水的换水，追肥的追肥。没几天，队里所有的秧苗都脱掉“黄袍”，换上“绿袍”。
    几天以后，一个漆黑的夜晚，雷雨把宋长春从梦中惊醒。他爬下床，顶了个破雨帽，就向门外冲去。跑到田边，连忙用手试试田里水的深度，然后自言自语地说：“还好！没淹着。”老田长顺着田埂，把一块块田的缺口扒开，放掉多余的积水。猛然他想起宋队长管理的那十八亩丰产田，于是，他立即向队长那块田走去。
    忽然一个闪电，照得大地通明。老田长看见田埂上有个头戴斗笠、身穿蓑衣的年轻人，正向他这边走来。“是队长吗？”宋长春早已猜着了八、九分。田埂那头答道：“长春伯，是我！”
    队长一听是老田长，不由得加快脚步，他又关心又责备地说：“我早对你说了，不要半夜三更到田里来，怎么又来啦？”
    老田长解释着：“你看，下这么大的雨，我在家能呆得住吗？”
    队长用手往老田长身上一摸，吃惊地说：“哎呀！全身都淋湿了，快！我送你回去。”
      “不！淋点雨算什么！”老田长固执地说：“队长！你已经有几天没好好休息了，还是你先回去吧！”
    两人争执了好一会，谁也不肯先回去。最后终于取得一致意见：帮助别人把秧田内多余的水都放掉，一道回去。
