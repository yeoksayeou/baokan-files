    Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 26th: Our correspondent reports: The central stadium in Vienna chimed seven times, marking the opening of the 7th World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship. This is the first song of triumph of the festival. Over ten thousand young people from all over the world and tens of thousands of Viennese residents shouted for peace and friendship in unison. The enemy's sabotage conspiracies and despicable activities against the festival have been crushed.
    The reactionary forces of the West, fearing peace and friendship, tried every means to prevent the festival from being held in Vienna. American spies posted slogans and distributed leaflets in Vienna, and even deployed airplanes to fly over Vienna with large banners slandering the festival. The reactionaries also adopted threats against young people to prevent them from participating in the festival.
    As representatives from various countries arrived one after another, malicious individuals sent out a large number of henchmen to carry out disruptive activities. Recently, a "statement" signed by the "American Youth Delegation" appeared in Vienna. The "statement" openly slandered the idea of peace and friendship and attempted to provoke divisions among young people from various countries. However, this despicable act was immediately exposed by four members of the American Youth Delegation, proving that this so-called "statement of the American Youth Delegation" was purely fabricated.
    The reactionaries set up a "Youth" publishing house in Vienna, specializing in publishing books and periodicals against the festival. This publishing house is located in the "printing factory" of the "News," and the editor-in-chief of the "News," Fritz Molden, is the son-in-law of Allen Dulles, the head of the US intelligence agency and a notorious figure. This clearly tells people who the string-puller behind the anti-festival activities is. In short, the enemy tried every means to maintain a "cold war" atmosphere among young people, but the torrent of peace and friendship will wash away all these dirty conspiracies.

### 和平友谊洪流冲垮了敌人破坏阴谋活动  联欢节奏起第一支凯歌

    和平友谊洪流冲垮了敌人破坏阴谋活动
    联欢节奏起第一支凯歌
    据新华社维也纳26日电　本社记者报道：维也纳中央运动场上钟鸣七响，第七届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节开幕了。这是联欢节的第一支凯歌，一万几千名来自世界各地的青年与几万维也纳居民齐声高呼和平友谊，联欢节敌人的破坏阴谋和卑鄙的勾当都被粉碎了。
    害怕和平友好的西方反动势力曾经想尽各种办法阻止联欢节在维也纳举行。美国特务在维也纳张贴标语、散发传单，甚至出动飞机拖着诬蔑联欢节的大幅标语在维也纳上空盘旋。反动派为了阻止青年参加联欢节，还对青年采取了威胁手段。
    当各国代表陆续到达时，别有用心的人又派出了大批的爪牙，进行扰乱活动。最近，在维也纳出现了以“美国青年代表团”署名的“声明”，“声明”中公然大肆污蔑和平友谊的思想，妄图在各国青年中挑起分歧。但是这一卑鄙行为立即被美国青年代表团的四位成员所揭穿，证明这份所谓“美国青年代表团”的声明纯属捏造。
    反动派在维也纳设立了专门出版反对联欢节书刊的“少年”出版社，这个出版社就设在“新闻报”的“印刷厂”里，而“新闻报”的总编辑佛里次·莫耳登是美国情报局的头子、臭名昭著的艾伦·杜勒斯的女婿，这清楚地告诉人们，反联欢节活动的牵线人是谁。总之，敌人千方百计地企图在青年中保持“冷战”的气氛，但是和平与友谊的洪流将会把这一切龌龊的阴谋冲刷得干干净净。
