Parents' Responsibility

While people are saving electricity, some residents leave their lights on all night while they sleep. It is said that they have reasons for leaving the lights on, such as the two families in my dormitory who don't turn off the lights because their children will cry if they do. Therefore, they would rather waste electricity than let their children cry. However, according to our understanding from the power supply department, if a household uses six more hours of electricity per day, it will waste 360 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. This amount of electricity can weave 90 bolts of white cloth or grind 360 bags of flour. Many employees in our dormitory are very opposed to this waste. I believe that children's habits are inseparable from their parents' upbringing. Parents should cultivate good habits in their children of turning off the lights when they sleep and have the responsibility to educate the next generation to establish the good quality of diligence and thrift.

    家长的责任
    正当人们都在节约用电的时候，有些住户却通宵达旦地开着灯睡觉。据说他们开灯睡觉有理由，如我住的宿舍里就有两户人家，他们不关灯的理由是：闭灯，孩子要哭，因此宁肯浪费电，也不让孩子哭。但据我们从供电部门了解，若一户一天多用六小时的电，全年就要浪费掉三百六十度电，用这些电可织九十匹白布，可磨三百六十袋面粉。我们同宿舍的许多职工都非常反对这种浪费行为。我认为小孩子的习惯是和大人的教养分不开的。做家长的应该使小孩养成闭灯睡觉的好习惯，更有责任教育下一代树立勤俭节约的好品质。
