    Ethiopia is a historically old constitutional monarchy located in northeastern Africa, formerly known as Abyssinia. It was occupied by Italy in 1935. After World War II, it regained its independence and formed a federation with Eritrea in 1952. Ethiopia participated in the Bandung Conference in 1955.

    Ethiopia has a total area of more than 1.18 million square kilometers, exceeding the combined area of ​​the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. The country has a population of 19.5 million, mostly mixed-race Arabs and African blacks.

    Ethiopia is an economically underdeveloped agricultural and pastoral country with fertile land suitable for agricultural development. The arable land area is 11 million hectares, but only 15% is utilized. Approximately 90% of the population is engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. Agricultural products include coffee, oilseeds, grains, beans, sugarcane, and cotton. Coffee production ranges from 400,000 to 600,000 tons per year. It is Ethiopia's main source of income and its most important export, accounting for approximately 50%-60% of total exports. Ethiopia's animal husbandry is also quite developed. In 1957, the number of cattle reached 22 million, and goats and sheep numbered 20 million and 15 million, respectively.

    Ethiopia's industry is very backward, with only 132 factories nationwide. The total annual output value is only US$34.57 million, and most of the industry and mining are controlled by foreign capital. Many industrial products rely on imports, mostly textiles.

    Currently, Ethiopia is trying to develop industry and mining, gradually using machinery in agriculture, and implementing development plans for hydropower generation and irrigation systems. (Mao)

    埃塞俄比亚
    埃塞俄比亚是非洲东北部的一个历史悠久的君主立宪国家，以前也叫阿比西尼亚。1935年曾被意大利侵占，第二次世界大战后恢复独立，并在1952年和厄立特里亚结成联邦。埃塞俄比亚是1955年万隆会议的参加国。
    埃塞俄比亚全国面积有一百十八万多平方公里，超过英法意三国面积之和。全国人口为一千九百五十万人，大都是阿拉伯人和非洲黑人混血种。
    埃塞俄比亚是个经济比较落后的农牧业国家，境内土地肥沃，适于发展农业，耕地面积为一千一百万公顷，但仅有15％被利用。全国有90％左右的人从事农牧业，农产品有咖啡、油籽、谷物、豆类、甘蔗和棉花等。咖啡年产四十到六十万吨，它是埃塞俄比亚收入之主要来源，也是埃塞俄比亚最重要的出口物，占出口总值的50％—60％左右。埃塞俄比亚的畜牧业也相当发达，1957年，牛的数量达二千二百万头，山羊和绵羊各为二千万头和一千五百万头。
    埃塞俄比亚的工业很落后，全国只有一百三十二家工厂，全年生产总值只有三千四百五十七万美元，工矿业大部分为外国资本所控制。许多工业品都依靠进口，大部分是纺织品。
    目前埃塞俄比亚正在设法发展工矿业，逐步在农业中使用机械，水力发电和灌溉系统的发展计划也在实施中。　　　（茂）
