“Economic Stabilization Plan” – A Tool for the United States to Plunder Latin America
Chen Shushi
    New Methods of Plunder and Expansion
      The “Economic Stabilization Plan” is one of the main forms through which American imperialism has been using the "International Monetary Fund" to control and expand into Latin America in the past year. This plan is essentially no different from the "Inflation Control Plan" proposed to the Chilean government by the American Klein-Saks delegation in the autumn of 1955 and the "Basic Economic Stabilization Plan" proposed to Bolivia by American International Telephone and Telegraph consultant Eder at the end of 1956. However, it is clear that this plan covers a wider scope and involves more specific details, and therefore has greater destructive power.
    The "Economic Stabilization Plan" in Argentina is a clear example. This plan, styled as one of "economy and sacrifice," was formulated with the direct participation of the United States. Since President Frondizi took office last May, the United States has intensified its activities in Argentina. In July of last year, a delegation from the "International Monetary Fund" and a delegation from the U.S. Export-Import Bank jointly visited Argentina to conduct a comprehensive review of Argentina's economic situation. In October, representatives of twenty-six U.S. monopoly enterprises went to Buenos Aires and held five days of secret meetings with Argentine government leaders. In late October, the "International Monetary Fund" issued a report "recommending" that the Argentine government immediately take strong measures to deal with its economic crisis. The report emphasized that it was necessary to adopt strict fiscal policies and make workers make sacrifices. After months of enormous pressure, on December 29 last year, the United States finally forced the Argentine government to accept without reservation the so-called "Economic and Fiscal Stabilization Plan" formulated by the "International Monetary Fund" for Argentina. The main contents of this plan are: to abolish foreign exchange controls and devalue the peso; to abolish all controls on foreign trade; to suppress wages, abolish price controls, and eliminate price subsidies for consumers; to contract credit and eliminate losses of state-owned enterprises by means of transferring ownership or seeking assistance from foreign capital; to lay off 300,000 employees in government departments and increase taxes; to greatly increase oil prices, and increase train, urban transportation costs, and electricity fees, etc. Obviously, in addition to making Argentina accept a series of measures economically that were unfavorable to the nation and the people, this plan also undertook domestic and foreign political obligations. Since January of this year, the Frondizi government's reactionary measures such as closing the Argentine Communist Party's offices and newspapers, banning the activities of the Communist Party and democratic progressive groups, and suppressing strikes are directly related to accepting this enslaving plan.
    In addition to Argentina, Chile and Bolivia have also accepted the enslaving conditions put forward by the "International Monetary Fund" and implemented the "Economic Stabilization Plan." This organization is also active in Uruguay and other South American countries, attempting to induce these countries to sign loan agreements that are beneficial to U.S. monopoly capital but harmful to the national interests and people's lives of these countries, and implement the so-called "Economic Stabilization Plan."
  The Essence of the "Economic Stabilization Plan"
    Although the "Economic Stabilization Plan" hangs up the signboard of the "International Monetary Fund" and conducts activities in the guise of "expert" advice, it still cannot conceal the essence of its comprehensive enslavement and cruel plunder of imperialist aggression. This self-proclaimed panacea is said to be aimed at stabilizing the economies of these countries by curbing inflation and balancing international payments. However, judging from the several main details stipulated in the plan, it cannot curb inflation, nor can it balance international payments, and naturally cannot play any role in stabilizing the economy.
    First, abolishing the multiple exchange rate system and allowing exchange rates to rise and fall freely will inevitably lead to a sharp devaluation of the local currency. Currency devaluation will allow foreign, mainly American, importers to buy Latin American raw materials and agricultural products at lower prices and sell them at international market prices, thereby obtaining a much larger profit than before. However, this extra profit has to be borne by the countries implementing the "Economic Stabilization Plan." On the other hand, the multiple exchange rate system adopted by many Latin American countries still plays some role in promoting and protecting their domestic industries. Now that it is abolished and the local currency is greatly devalued, it will require more funds to pay for imported raw materials and necessary equipment. In this way, the cost of industrial production will be greatly increased, and the result will inevitably affect the development of national industries. Abolishing foreign exchange controls also allows foreign investors to freely remit profits abroad without hindrance, which is of course beneficial to foreign monopolists. However, due to the unrestricted outflow of funds, the wealth of Latin American countries is in danger of being completely sucked dry.
    Second, the abolition of restrictions on imports is mainly for the import of American goods. However, the United States itself has always built tariff barriers and adopted a policy of restricting imports from Latin America. This is not an equal treatment at all. Allowing underdeveloped countries to adopt a laissez-faire approach to imported goods will flood the domestic market with foreign goods. The outdated Latin American national industries cannot compete with these goods. If this measure is linked to requirements such as reducing government spending and contracting industrial credit, then
  The true purpose of the "Economic Stabilization Plan" is to paralyze or prevent the development of state-owned enterprises and national industries in these countries, which is obvious.
    Third, freezing wages, abolishing price controls, abolishing price subsidies for consumers, laying off employees, increasing taxes, and greatly increasing public utility costs are the most blatant and cruel direct plunder of the working people, the vast number of salary earners, and the self-employed.
    It can be seen that the true intention of the "Economic Stabilization Plan" imposed by the United States on many Latin American countries through the "International Monetary Fund" is to destroy the limited protective measures of these countries in terms of exchange rates and import and export trade, to undermine the already very weak state-owned enterprises and national industries in Latin American countries, and to create more favorable conditions for the export of American capital and goods, so as to extract more profits and carry out tighter control. Of course, while U.S. monopoly capital organizations, Latin American landlords, oligarchs, and big capitalists get rich, the broad masses of the people will inevitably fall into a deeper abyss of poverty.
        Disastrous Consequences
    Since some Latin American countries were forced to implement the "Economic Stabilization Plan," it has produced disastrous consequences. Argentina's national production index is constantly declining. Compared with May of last year, it has decreased by 4%, and if compared with 1952, it has decreased by 10%. Chile's total industrial production index also decreased by 10% in the three years from 1955 to 1958. Inflation in these countries has not only not been curbed, but has intensified. According to statistics from the Central Bank of Argentina, 10.54 billion pesos were issued in just one week from March 15 to 23. In the one-year period since Frondizi took office last May, the currency in circulation has increased by more than 20 billion pesos. Before the implementation of the "Economic Stabilization Plan," the official exchange rate of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar was eighteen to one, and the free exchange market was sixty-eight to one. However, since May of this year, the peso exchange rate has continued to fall, and by the beginning of June it had fallen to one hundred and ten to one. Chile's currency in circulation has also increased from 106.1 billion pesos in 1955 to 266.4 billion pesos in February 1959; each U.S. dollar could only be exchanged for 630 pesos in 1955, while in March 1959 it could be exchanged for 1,053 pesos. The value of Bolivia's currency has also fallen by 53% from 1956 to March of this year.
    With the decline in production, inflation, and repeated currency devaluation, prices in these countries have soared. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics of Argentina, the cost of living in the first five months of this year rose by 65%, and compared with May of last year when Frondizi took office, it rose by a total of 124%. In particular, public utility costs and gasoline prices have risen by between one and three times since the implementation of the "Economic Stabilization Plan." However, the wages of the national working people have been frozen at last year's level. The cost of living index in Chile has increased by more than two times from 1955 to March of this year. According to a report from the Chilean National Bureau of Statistics, the cost of living rose by 12.93% in the first three months of this year alone, and by a total of 36.7% from March of last year to March of this year. The cost of living in Bolivia in January of this year also rose by 154% compared to 1956. The result of the implementation of the "Economic Stabilization Plan" cannot but arouse strong opposition from the people of each country. In these countries, demonstrations and strikes protesting rising prices and opposing economic policies that succumb to the pressure of U.S. monopoly capital are magnificent and rise one after another. The resistance of the Latin American people to the enslaving "plan" of the "International Monetary Fund" has become increasingly strong and widespread. American imperialism is exerting enormous pressure, demanding that these governments that sell out their national interests take even more severe measures to attack the people. But today, colonialism is on the decline, and the era when the Latin American people were arbitrarily manipulated by foreign forces is gone forever. Any "plan" of U.S. imperialism to plunder and expand into Latin America under various guises will inevitably meet with a shameful failure.
    The Brazilian government's decision to stop negotiations with the "International Monetary Fund" is a prominent example. On the one hand, this decision of the Brazilian government caused great anxiety to the United States, fearing that this decision of Brazil would cause Latin American countries to follow suit, but on the other hand, it received unanimous praise from the public and public opinion in Brazil and Latin American countries. Chilean economic commentator Marx Norlf recently published an article in the Chilean weekly "South Pacific Post" pointing out that the dignified and highly independent attitude adopted by Brazil has pointed the way for the people of Latin American countries. Norlf said that if everyone supports the Brazilian government's approach, then the "International Monetary Fund" will have to change its "short-sighted and unwise" policies, and Latin American countries will be able to handle their own economic problems in their own way.

    “稳定经济计划”—美国掠夺拉丁美洲的工具
    陈叔时
    掠夺和扩张的新方法
      “稳定经济计划”是最近一年来美帝国主义通过“国际货币基金组织”对拉丁美洲进行控制和扩张的主要形式之一。这个计划，同1955年秋美国克莱因—萨克斯代表团向智利政府提出的“制止通货膨胀计划”和1956年底美国国际电报电话公司顾问埃德尔向玻利维亚提出的“稳定基本经济计划”基本上没有什么区别。但是显然，这个计划所包括的范围更广，所牵涉的细节更加具体，因此它具有更大的破坏力。
    阿根廷的“稳定经济计划”是个明显的例证。这个名之为“节约与牺牲”的计划，是在美国直接参与下制定的。自从去年5月弗朗迪西总统就任以来，美国就对阿根廷加紧活动。去年7月间，“国际货币基金组织”的一个代表团和美国进出口银行的代表团联袂访问了阿根廷，对阿根廷的经济情况进行了全面的彻查。10月间，美国二十六家垄断企业的代表去布宜诺斯艾利斯，同阿根廷政府首脑举行了五天的秘密会议。10月下旬，“国际货币基金组织”发表了一份报告，“建议”阿根廷政府立即采取有力措施来对付它的经济危机。报告强调指出，采取严格的财政政策和使劳动者作出牺牲是必要的。这样经过几个月的巨大压力，到去年12月29日，美国终于迫使阿根廷政府无保留地接受“国际货币基金组织”为阿根廷所拟订的所谓“稳定经济和财政计划”。这项计划的主要内容是：取消外汇管制、比索贬值；取消对于对外贸易的一切控制；压低工资、取消对于物价的控制、取消对消费者的物价补贴；收缩信贷、用出让或向外国资本谋求援助的办法来消除国营企业的亏损；裁减政府各部门员工三十万名、增加税收；大大提高石油价格，增加火车、城市交通费用和电费等。显然，这个计划除了使阿根廷在经济上接受了一系列不利于民族、不利于人民的措施外，还承担了对内对外的政治义务。今年1月以来，弗朗迪西政府所采取的封闭阿根廷共产党机关和报刊、禁止共产党和民主进步团体活动、镇压罢工等等反动措施，是同接受这个奴役性的计划有直接联系的。
    除了阿根廷以外，智利和玻利维亚也都接受“国际货币基金组织”提出的奴役性条件，实行了“稳定经济计划”，这个组织还在乌拉圭和南美其他国家活动，企图诱迫这些国家签订一项有利于美国垄断资本而危害这些国家民族利益和人民生活的贷款协定，实施所谓“稳定经济计划”。
  “稳定经济计划”的实质
    尽管“稳定经济计划”挂起“国际货币基金组织”的招牌，以“专家”建议姿态进行活动，仍然掩盖不了它的全面奴役和残酷掠夺的帝国主义侵略的实质。这自吹能医治百病的计划，据说是以制止通货膨胀、平衡国际收支来稳定这些国家的经济为目的的。但是从计划所规定的几个主要细节看，它既不能制止通货膨胀，也不能平衡国际收支，自然起不了任何稳定经济的作用。
    第一，废除多种汇率制、听任汇价自行涨落，必然要引起本国货币的急剧贬值。货币贬值将使得外国、主要是美国的进口商可以用更低的价格购买拉丁美洲的原料和农产品，而以国际市场价格出卖，从而获得一笔比原先大得多的利润。然而这份额外利润却不得不由实施“稳定经济计划”的国家来负担。另一方面，拉丁美洲许多国家所采行的多种汇率制，多少还起着一些促进和保护本国工业的作用。现在一旦取消，本国货币又大大贬值，这就需要以更多的资金来支付进口原料和必要的装备。这样，工业生产成本将大大提高，结果必然会影响民族工业的发展。取消外汇控制，还使外国投资者毫无阻碍地可以把利润自由汇出国外，这当然对外国垄断资本家有利。但是，由于资金无限制地外流，拉丁美洲国家的财富却因此有完全被吮吸得一干二净的危险。
    第二，取消对输入的限制，主要是对美国商品进口而言。可是美国自己却一直筑起关税壁垒，对拉丁美洲采取限制进口的政策。这完全不是对等的待遇。不发达国家对进口商品采取放任的措施，将使外国商品充斥于国内市场，装备陈旧的拉丁美洲民族工业是不能同这些商品竞争的。如果把这一措施同减少政府开支、收缩工业信贷等等要求联系起来看，那末
  “稳定经济计划”的真正目的在于瘫痪或阻止这些国家的国营企业和民族工业的发展，这是显而易见的了。
    第三，冻结工资，取消对物价的控制，取消对消费者的物价补贴，裁减员工，增加税收，大大提高公用事业费用等等，是对劳动人民、广大薪给收入者和自由职业者最露骨最残酷的直接掠夺。
    由此可见，美国通过“国际货币基金组织”强加于拉丁美洲许多国家头上的“稳定经济计划”的真正意图，在于摧毁这些国家在汇率上和进出口贸易上一些有限的保护措施，破坏拉丁美洲各国基础本来就极薄弱的一些国营企业和民族工业，给美国资本和商品的输出造成更加有利的条件，以便榨取更多的利润，进行更加紧密的控制。当然，在美国垄断资本组织、拉丁美洲的地主寡头和大资本家发财致富的同时，广大人民群众必将陷于更加贫困的深渊。
        灾难性的后果
    拉丁美洲一些国家自从被迫实行“稳定经济计划”以来，已经产生了灾难性的后果。阿根廷的国民生产指数正在不断下降。以今年5月同去年5月相比，已经下降了4％，如果同1952年相比则下降了10％。智利的工业生产总指数在1955年到1958年的三年中也下降了10％。这些国家的通货膨胀，不仅没有被制止，反而有加无已。据阿根廷中央银行统计，仅在3月15日到23日一周内就增发了通货十亿五千四百万比索。从弗朗迪西去年5月就任以来一年的时期中，流通货币已经增加了二百多亿比索。在实施“稳定经济计划”以前，阿根廷的比索同美元的比价，官价是十八比一，自由汇兑市场是六十八比一。但从今年5月以来比索汇价连续下跌，6月初已跌至一百一十比一。智利的流通货币也从1955年的一千零六十一亿比索增到1959年2月的二千六百六十四亿比索；每一美元在1955年时仅能兑六百三十比索，而1959年3月可以换到一千零五十三个比索。玻利维亚的货币价值也从1956年起到今年3月共下跌了53％。
    随着生产下降、通货膨胀和货币一再贬值，这些国家的物价飞速上涨。据阿根廷全国统计局材料，今年头五个月生活费用上涨了65％，同去年5月弗朗迪西上台时比较，共上涨了124％。尤其是公用事业费用和汽油价格，从实施“稳定经济计划”以来已经上涨了一倍至三倍不等。但是全国劳动人民的工资却被冻结在去年的水平。智利的生活指数，从1955年到今年3月已增长了二倍之多。据智利国家统计局报告，仅今年头三个月生活费就上涨了12.93％，从去年3月到今年3月共上涨了36.7％。玻利维亚今年1月的生活费用也比1956年上涨了154％。“稳定经济计划”实施的结果，不能不引起各该国人民强烈反对。在这些国家中，抗议物价上涨，反对屈从美国垄断资本压力的经济政策的示威游行和罢工运动波澜壮阔，此伏彼起，拉丁美洲人民对于“国际货币基金组织”奴役性“计划”的反抗已经越来越强烈，越来越普遍。美帝国主义正在施加巨大压力，要求这些出卖祖国利益的政府采取更加严厉的措施来向人民进攻。但是今天，殖民主义正在走向没落，拉丁美洲人民被外国势力任意摆布的时代已经一去不复返了。美帝国主义一切巧立名目向拉丁美洲进行掠夺和扩张的任何“计划”，必将遭到可耻的失败。
    巴西政府停止同“国际货币基金组织”的谈判的决定就是一个突出的例子。巴西政府的这个决定，一方面使美国感到极大不安，担心巴西的这个决定会使拉丁美洲国家群起效法，但另方面却得到巴西和拉丁美洲各国公众和舆论的一致赞扬。智利经济评论员马克斯·诺耳夫最近在智利周刊“南太平洋邮报”发表文章指出，巴西所采取的具有尊严和高度独立的态度，给拉丁美洲各国的人民指出了道路。诺耳夫说，如果大家都支持巴西政府的这种做法，那么“国际货币基金组织”将不得不改变它的“近视和不明智”的政策，拉丁美洲国家将能按照自己的办法处理本国的经济问题。
