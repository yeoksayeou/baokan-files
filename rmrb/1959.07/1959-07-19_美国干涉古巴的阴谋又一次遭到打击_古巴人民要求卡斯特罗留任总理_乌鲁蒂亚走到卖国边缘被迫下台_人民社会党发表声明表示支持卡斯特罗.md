Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 18th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro announced in a televised broadcast on the evening of the 17th that he was resigning from his position. He said, "I am resigning because I have disagreements with the President (Urrutia) in the current situation and cannot perform my duties."

Castro pointed out, "Our enemies abroad, those plotters in the (American) Senate or heaven knows where, those reactionary forces, are ready to attack us," while Urrutia began to formulate "an elaborate plan against the government similar to Diaz Lanz's plan." Cuban traitor and former Air Force Commander Diaz Lanz recently fled to the United States.

Castro said that Urrutia's "attitude is on the verge of treason."

Castro also accused the US Senate Internal Security Subcommittee—a spy committee—of "stooping so low as to have a traitor (Diaz Lanz) testify."

The news of Castro's impending resignation was first announced by "Revolución," the organ of the "July 26th Movement," on the morning of the 17th. The news spread like wildfire throughout the cities and villages of the island nation. Upon hearing the news, the masses of people and trade unions, farmers' associations, student organizations, etc., in Havana, Oriente, Las Villas, and Camagüey provinces immediately sent telegrams and made phone calls, expressing their support for Prime Minister Castro and demanding that he not resign. In Havana, many people gathered in front of the Presidential Palace, shouting slogans supporting Castro. They demanded that land reform continue under Castro's leadership, that national sovereignty be maintained, and that Urrutia resign immediately. Conrado Becquer, General Secretary of the Cuban National Sugar Workers Federation, which has 510,000 members, issued a statement on the 17th, expressing support for Castro and demanding that Urrutia resign from the presidency. The statement said, "We make this demand because Fidel Castro is the defender of the people's freedom and rights"; "We cannot lose the great revolutionary goals achieved with the support of Castro, the main figure in the revolution, simply because of differences, because of a group of conspirators"; "If Urrutia hopes to serve the motherland and save Cuba in these tragic days, we sugar workers demand that he resign from the presidency for the benefit of Cuba, so that we will not lose our freedom."

Raúl Castro, Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Armed Forces, delivered a radio address on the 17th, calling on the people of the country to remain calm. Havana Radio called on workers to continue working and not to take any strike action, as doing so would only "benefit Cuba's enemies."

On the evening of the 17th, after Prime Minister Castro delivered his televised speech, Urrutia announced his resignation. Urrutia had served as a judge in the Batista dictatorship's government. He went to the United States in April 1957 and returned to Cuba on the eve of Batista's collapse. Urrutia claimed that he had always been anti-communist and had recently made several anti-communist remarks.

Subsequently, the cabinet held an emergency meeting and decided that Dr. Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado, the former Minister of Revolutionary Law, would succeed as President. Dorticós was sworn in at midnight that day.

The new President Dorticós issued a public appeal on the 18th, requesting Prime Minister Castro to remain in office. The Cuban cabinet also guaranteed its support for Castro and rejected his resignation request.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 17th: The Cuban People's Socialist Party issued a statement on the 17th saying that Castro's resignation was caused by the despicable attacks and opposition from traitors, counter-revolutionaries, and the American ambassador. The statement pointed out that it was not Castro who should resign, but others.

The statement said that the conspiracy to attack Castro under the guise of anti-communism was directly instigated by the United States. US imperialism is the main enemy of the Cuban people and Castro.

The statement pointed out that the revolutionary people of Cuba must say that we cannot accept Castro's resignation. Because Castro's resignation would mean that the conspirators and counter-revolutionaries would triumph, that land reform, national independence, revolutionary rule of law, and economic development would suffer setbacks, and that the bright hopes of the Latin American people pinned on the Cuban revolution would be dashed.

The statement concluded that Cuba needs a more revolutionary government than it has today in order to eliminate reaction, treason, conspiracy, and regression.

Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: Havana: Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa accused the United States in a television program on the 16th of attempting to use the Dominican dictatorship and Batista elements to attack Cuba.

Roa said that there are currently 6,000 mercenaries gathering in the Dominican Republic, preparing to invade Cuba. He accused that this invasion conspiracy is directly related to the appearance of Cuban traitor Diaz Lanz before the US Senate Internal Security Subcommittee.

The Foreign Minister pointed out that a group of Batista elements in the United States is plotting an invasion of Cuba in Washington. Among them is Laureano Portuondo, the representative to the United Nations during the Batista dictatorship. He said that the conspirators are carrying out activities through a reactionary group called "White Rose" in the United States and various groups within the Dominican Republic.

Prior to this, Western news agencies reported that Trujillo's army, acting as a pawn for US armed intervention in Cuba, and Batista elements in the United States are standing by, ready to jointly attack Cuba. An invasion army composed of fascists recruited from many countries is being trained in the Dominican Republic. The Trujillo regime has sent people to Europe to recruit soldiers for this purpose. Mercenaries of different nationalities were transported by plane from Paris and Spain to the Dominican Republic under the guise of "refugees."

According to American news agencies, the United States is the Trujillo regime's main arms supplier. In addition, the Trujillo regime also purchased weapons from Britain, Spain, Italy, and other places, including helicopters and landing craft.

    美国干涉古巴的阴谋又一次遭到打击
    古巴人民要求卡斯特罗留任总理
    乌鲁蒂亚走到卖国边缘被迫下台
    人民社会党发表声明表示支持卡斯特罗
    新华社18日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴总理卡斯特罗17日晚上在电视广播中发表声明，要求辞去他的总理职务。他说，“我之所以辞职，是因为我在目前情况下跟总统（乌鲁蒂亚）发生分歧而不可能行使我的职责。”
    卡斯特罗指出，“我们国外的敌人、那些在（美国）参议院或者天知道是哪里的一些阴谋人物、那些反动势力已摆好阵势准备打击我们”，而乌鲁蒂亚却开始制订“一项同迪亚斯·兰斯的计划相类似的反对政府的周密计划”。古巴叛徒前空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯是最近逃跑到美国去的。
    卡斯特罗说，乌鲁蒂亚“的态度是在卖国边缘上。”
    卡斯特罗还指责美国参院国内安全委员会——一个做间谍工作的委员会，“竟然卑鄙到要一个卖国贼（迪亚斯·兰斯）去作证”。
    卡斯特罗要辞职的消息是“7月26日运动”的机关报“革命报”在17日晨首先公布的。这个消息像野火一样，迅速地传遍了这个岛国的城市和乡村。古巴首都哈瓦那和奥连特、拉斯维利亚斯和卡马圭等省的人民群众和工会、农会、学生组织等，在闻讯后立即纷纷打电报和电话，表示拥护卡斯特罗总理，并且要求他不要辞职。在哈瓦那，很多群众聚集到总统府门前高呼支持卡斯特罗的口号。他们要求在卡斯特罗领导下继续进行土地改革，维护国家主权，并且要求乌鲁蒂亚立即辞职。拥有五十一万会员的古巴全国糖业工人联合会总书记孔拉多·贝克尔17日发表声明，表示拥护卡斯特罗，同时要求乌鲁蒂亚辞去总统职务。声明说，“我们之所以要提出这个要求，是因为菲德尔·卡斯特罗是人民的自由和权利的保卫者”；“我们不能仅仅由于分歧，由于一批阴谋者，而丧失在革命的主要人物卡斯特罗支持下达到的伟大的革命目的”；“如果乌鲁蒂亚希望为祖国服务，希望在悲惨的日子里拯救古巴的话，我们制糖工人要求他为了古巴的利益辞去总统的职务，这样我们就不会丧失我们的自由了。”
    古巴武装部队总司令劳尔·卡斯特罗17日发表广播演说，号召全国人民保持镇静。哈瓦那电台号召工人继续进行工作，不要采取任何罢工行动，因为这样做只会“有利于古巴的敌人”。
    在卡斯特罗总理发表电视演说后的当晚，乌鲁蒂亚宣布辞职。乌鲁蒂亚曾任巴蒂斯塔独裁政府的法官，他在1957年4月前往美国，在巴蒂斯塔垮台的前夕回到古巴。乌鲁蒂亚自称他一贯反共，并在最近接连发表了数次反共的谈话。”
    接着，内阁召开了紧急会议，决定由原任革命法律部部长奥斯瓦耳多·多尔蒂科斯博士继任总统。多尔蒂科斯已在当天午夜宣誓就职。
    新总统多尔蒂科斯在18日发表公开的呼吁，要求卡斯特罗总理继续留任。古巴内阁也保证支持卡斯特罗，并且拒绝了他的辞职要求。
    新华社哈瓦那17日电　古巴人民社会党17日发表声明说，卡斯特罗的辞职是由叛国者、反革命分子和美国大使对他的卑鄙攻击和反对引起的。声明指出，应该辞职的不是卡斯特罗，而是其他人。
    声明说，那些在反共的幌子下攻击卡斯特罗的阴谋是直接由美国挑起的。美帝国主义是古巴人民和卡斯特罗的主要敌人。
    声明指出，古巴革命人民必须说，我们不能接受卡斯特罗的辞职。因为卡斯特罗的辞职将意味着使阴谋者和反革命分子获得胜利，使土地改革、国家独立、革命法制和经济发展遭到后退，使拉丁美洲人民寄托于古巴革命的光辉希望遭到破灭。
    声明最后指出，古巴需要一个比今天更加革命的政府，以便消灭反动、叛国、阴谋和倒退。
    新华社18日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚16日在电视节目中指责美国企图利用多米尼加独裁政权和巴蒂斯塔分子来进攻古巴。
    罗亚说，目前有六千名雇佣军在多米尼加集结，准备入侵古巴。他指责说，这种入侵阴谋同古巴叛徒迪亚斯·兰斯在美国参议院国内安全小组委员会的出现有直接的关系。
    这位外交部长指出，在美国的一批巴蒂斯塔分子正在华盛顿策划对古巴的入侵。其中有巴蒂斯塔独裁时期驻联合国代表劳涅斯·波尔图翁多。他说，阴谋者是通过在美国的一个叫做“白玫瑰”的反动集团和多米尼加共和国境内的各种集团来进行活动的。
  在此以前，西方通讯社的消息表明，充当美国武装干涉古巴的走卒的特鲁希略军队和在美国的巴蒂斯塔分子正在待命出动，准备联合进攻古巴。一支从许多国家召募而来的法西斯分子组成的侵略军，正在多米尼加进行训练。特鲁希略政权为此曾派人到欧洲去招兵买马。不同国籍的雇佣兵被以“难民”的身份用飞机从巴黎和西班牙运到了多米尼加。
    据美国通讯社报道，美国是特鲁希略政权主要的军火供给者。此外，特鲁希略政权还到英国、西班牙、意大利等地购买武器，其中包括直升飞机和登陆艇。
