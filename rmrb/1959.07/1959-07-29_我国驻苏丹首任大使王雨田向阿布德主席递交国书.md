Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 27th: Khartoum dispatch: Wang Yutian, China's first ambassador to Sudan, presented his credentials to Ibrahim Abboud, Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces of Sudan, on the 26th.

    In his speech, Ambassador Wang Yutian, on behalf of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and the Chinese people, extended sincere greetings and best wishes to Chairman Abboud and the Sudanese people, wishing Sudan prosperity and the Sudanese people happiness.

    Ambassador Wang Yutian said that although vast oceans geographically separate the Chinese and Sudanese peoples, the two peoples are closely linked in feeling. Like the Sudanese people, the Chinese people have suffered from imperialist and colonialist aggression and oppression, and have carried out long and arduous struggles for national independence. Therefore, they have boundless sympathy and high respect for the heroic Sudanese people who have a glorious tradition of opposing foreign colonial rule and have finally achieved national independence.

    Ambassador Wang Yutian said that both China and Sudan are participants in the Bandung Conference, and both countries are willing to abide by the Bandung Principles. He firmly believes that China and Sudan will further strengthen and consolidate the friendly cooperation between the two peoples in accordance with the Bandung Principles. The Chinese people cherish this friendly cooperation very much, because it is not only beneficial to the people of our two countries, but also conducive to safeguarding the cause of peace in Asia, Africa, and the world.

    In his reply, Chairman Abboud welcomed Ambassador Wang Yutian. He said that for the benefit of both countries, we hope to promote relations between the two countries and make them last forever. Chairman Abboud asked Ambassador Wang Yutian to convey his personal greetings and best wishes to the Chairman of the People's Republic of China.

    When Ambassador Wang Yutian left the Presidential Palace, the crowd gathered outside applauded him warmly.

    我国驻苏丹首任大使王雨田向阿布德主席递交国书
    新华社开罗27日电　喀土穆消息：中国驻苏丹首任大使王雨田26日向苏丹武装部队最高委员会主席易卜拉欣·阿布德递交国书。
    王雨田大使在致颂辞时，代表刘少奇主席和中国人民向阿布德主席和苏丹人民致以诚挚的问候和最好的祝愿，祝苏丹繁荣兴旺，苏丹人民幸福。
    王雨田大使说，虽然在地理上，辽阔的海洋把中国人民和苏丹人民隔开，但是两国人民在感情上却是紧密联系的。中国人民像苏丹人民一样，曾经受过帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略和压迫，为争取民族独立进行过长期艰苦的斗争。因此他们对于具有反对外国殖民统治的光荣传统和终于实现了民族独立的英勇的苏丹人民，怀有无限的同情和崇高的敬意。
    王雨田大使说，中国和苏丹都是万隆会议的参加国，两国都愿意遵守万隆原则。他深信，中国和苏丹将根据万隆原则进一步加强和巩固两国人民之间的友好合作。中国人民非常珍贵这种友好合作，因为这不但有利于我们两国人民，并且还有利于保卫亚洲、非洲和全世界的和平事业。
    阿布德主席在致答辞时表示欢迎王雨田大使。他说，为了两国的利益，我们希望促进两国之间的关系并且使它永远存在下去。阿布德主席请王雨田大使向中华人民共和国主席转达他个人的问候和最好的祝愿。
    当王雨田大使离开共和国宫时，聚集在外面的群众向他热烈鼓掌。
