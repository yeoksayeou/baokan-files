    "Loving and protecting state property" has become a noble virtue of the broad masses of the people in our country. Recently, I saw many workers write this "love" in their pledges for increased production and conservation. Why? The reason is very simple. Because we are the masters of this country, we should have the sense of responsibility of being the masters.
    It is reasonable for people to closely link "love" and "protection," because: only with "love" can there be "protection."
    We can often see such things. When a person wears a favorite set of clothes, he always dusts off the chair before sitting down; this is even more true for his beloved children. When sleeping, he always lets the child sleep on the inside of the bed, fearing that he will roll to the ground and get hurt; when going to the street, he holds the child's small hand tightly, always fearing that something will bump into the child. So on and so forth, there is no end to it, as long as you pay attention, you can see and hear it everywhere. From this, it can be seen that the "protection" indeed contains extremely deep "love."
    It is the same with state property. With extremely deep "love," it is possible to "protect" with meticulous care, and even spare no effort to protect it when necessary. The great communist spirit of Xiang Xiuli, an outstanding Communist Party member and young female worker, who gloriously sacrificed herself to rescue state property and safeguard the lives of the masses; the excellent qualities of Xu Xuehui, a young accountant, who, despite being seriously injured, persisted in fighting bandits to defend state property, are concrete manifestations of extremely deep "love" for the great motherland and state property.
      "Love" is concrete, and "protection" is also concrete. To abstractly talk about "loving and protecting" without actual action, saying it a thousand times or ten thousand times, is merely a false reputation, it is fake, and not worth a penny. In daily life, not only having the idea of putting the interests of the state above personal interests and putting long-term interests above immediate interests, starting from the big picture, but also being able to consciously "love" every blade of grass and tree of the state, and "protect" every needle and thread of the state, starting from the small things, such "love and protection" is "love" that is real, and "protection" that is thorough, it is real, and cannot be exchanged for gold.
    The so-called "cannot be exchanged for gold" is because the "value" of such "love and protection" of state property is immeasurable. Our country has six hundred and tens of millions of people, everyone doing this, all the time, day after day, over time, the wealth saved is probably impossible to calculate without using astronomical figures. In the Shaanxi No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, there is a tea stove team composed of six people. In order to support national construction and conserve coal, they planned day and night, tried every means, screened unburned coal cinders from waste coal ash piles, shoveled usable coal soil from places where coal had been placed, and even ran around everywhere, searching east and west, even sweeping fallen leaves and picking up wood chips. As a result, they did not receive a single catty of coal for twenty months, but they supplied tea water to more than two thousand workers and two hundred and forty households of staff and workers day and night, saving the state more than 700 tons of coal. If this coal were used to generate electricity, it could generate 1.12 million kilowatt-hours of electricity; if it were used to make iron, it could refine 560,000 kilograms of iron; if it were used to make coke, it could refine 490,000 kilograms of coke and 35,000 kilograms of tar. Furthermore, the heroic deeds of Chen Xiaofa and Li Shaokui from the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, who rushed to rescue and protect the factory, which were published in the newspaper the other day, demonstrated the working class's heroic spirit of serving the public and forgetting themselves. These are all extremely vivid examples of love leading to protection.
    "Love" is the premise of "protection," and "protection" is the expression of "love." Only with meticulous "love" can there be meticulous "protection."

    “爱”而后能“护”
    孙平
    “爱护国家财产”，已经成为我国广大人民群众的一个高尚的美德了。最近我看到许多工人在增产节约保证书上，也写有这一“爱”。为什么？道理很简单。因为我们在这个国家当了家、做了主，就应当有这个当家做主的责任心。
    人们把“爱”和“护”紧紧地连在一起，是有道理的，因为：有“爱”才能有“护”。
    我们常常可以看到这样的事情。一个人穿了一身心爱的衣服，坐椅子，总是要拂一拂灰尘；对于自己心肝儿似的孩子，更是如此。睡觉的时候，总要让孩子睡在床里边，怕滚在地上摔伤了；上街的时候，紧紧地拉着孩子的小手，总怕什么东西把孩子碰伤了。如此等等，不一而足，只要留心，处处可见可闻。由此可见，这“护”的里边确是包含着极深极深的“爱”的。
    对国家财产，也是一样。有了极深极深的“爱”，才有可能无微不至的“护”，甚至在必要时不惜一切地去保护。优秀的共产党员、青年女工向秀丽，为了抢救国家财产，维护群众的生命安全，而光荣牺牲的伟大的共产主义精神；青年会计员徐学惠，为了保卫国家财产，虽身负重伤仍坚持和匪徒搏斗的优秀品质，正是对伟大祖国、对国家财产的极深极深的“爱”的具体表现。
      “爱”是具体的，“护”也是具体的。抽象地说“爱护”，而无实际行动，说一千遍、一万遍，徒具虚名而已，是假的，一文钱也不值。在日常生活中，不仅具有把国家利益放在个人利益之上、把长远利益放在眼前利益之上的思想，从大处着眼，而且能够自觉地“爱”国家的一草一木，“护”国家的一针一线，从小处着手，这样的“爱护”，才是“爱”得真实，“护”得彻底，是真的，是金也不能换的。
    所谓“金也不能换”，是因为这样对国家财产的“爱护”，其“价值”是不可估量的。我国六亿几千万人口，人人如此，时时如此，日积月累，久而久之，其节约的财富恐怕非用天文数字计算不可。陕西第一棉纺织厂里，有一个由六个人组成的茶炉小组，他们为了支援国家建设，节约用煤，日谋夜算，千方百计，从废煤灰堆里筛未烧过的煤碴，从放过煤的地方铲尚有用处的煤土，甚至东跑西跑，东找西找，连落叶也扫，木屑也拾，结果，二十个月没有领一斤煤，却夜以继日地充分地供应了两千多名工人和二百四十多户职工家属的茶水，为国家节约用煤达七百余吨。如果用这些煤发电，可以发一百一十二万度电，用来炼铁，可以炼五十六万公斤铁，用来炼焦，可以炼四十九万公斤焦又三万五千公斤焦油。再如前两天报上登的鞍山钢铁公司第一炼钢厂陈效法、李绍奎抢险护厂的事迹，表现了工人阶级为公忘私的英雄气概。这些都是由爱到护的极为生动的例子。
    “爱”是“护”的前提，“护”是“爱”的表现，有无微不至的“爱”，才能有无微不至的“护”。
