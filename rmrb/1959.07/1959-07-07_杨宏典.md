    The First Few Things
    One day in June, I went to interview Yang Hongdian. On the way, I kept thinking about a story I had heard before setting out: At the beginning of this year, a man dressed as a farmer arrived at the Shaluo Brigade of the Da Yao People's Commune in Liuyang County, Hunan Province. He went to the canteen, put down his luggage, and saw two cooks busy preparing food. The water tank was empty, so he picked up buckets, filled the tank; by the time the cooks noticed, he had already run to the pigsty and was busy cleaning up the accumulated manure. After cleaning the pig manure, he went to the fields to help commune member Li Shengyao with irrigating, chatting with him cordially while operating the waterwheel...
    Good news spreads especially quickly. In the evening, the commune members spread the word that the person who helped carry water, remove pig manure, and irrigate the fields during the day was the newly arrived Party Branch Secretary. These first few ordinary things deeply moved everyone. Some people came that night to personally recognize this hardworking person. When I arrived at the Shaluo Brigade office, Lao Yang was already out. The brigade secretary, knowing my purpose, asked: "Did you meet a tall person on the road, dressed in white, with blue cloth trousers, picking up manure?" I said I had met him and he was the first person I encountered picking up manure early in the morning. The secretary told me that the person was their Party Branch Secretary, Yang Hongdian. He gets up earlier than anyone else every day, getting up before dawn to pick up manure, all year round, without interruption. While picking up manure, he inspects the production and work of each production team. This is the first thing he does every day. He goes to the fields, carefully observes, and talks to cadres and the masses at any time. When he discovers problems, he relies on everyone to solve them on the spot, and the day's work is arranged. By the time his manure basket is heavily weighing down on his shoulders, he has roughly run more than ten miles, covering all nine production teams. Only then does he go to eat breakfast, and after breakfast, he goes to work with the commune members. "Where does he live and where does he work?" I asked the secretary doubtfully. He pointed to the four simple and unadorned civilian houses in front of him and said: "The staff of the Shaluo Brigade, including the secretary, accountant, warehouse keeper, and credit union, are all in this house. Secretary Yang himself doesn't want a separate office and has persuaded everyone not to put on airs, and that everything should be done simply.‚Äù It turned out that the desks and chairs here were all brought from their own homes. Yang Hongdian himself is even more of a role model, being frugal in everything. He doesn't have his own office, nor does he set up a separate bed, nor does he have a separate desk. He works wherever he is, lives, eats, and labors with the commune members. Meetings are mostly held on-site or in the homes of the masses, completely like a commune member. Everyone praised him and said: "Our leader is a 'guerrilla commander.'" The cadres also learned from his approach, going deep into the masses and taking root in the work teams.
    At the beginning of this year, a man dressed as a farmer arrived at the Shaluo Brigade of the Da Yao People's Commune in Liuyang County, Hunan Province. As soon as he put down his luggage, he helped the cooks carry water. He is Yang Hongdian, the newly arrived Party Branch Secretary of this brigade.
    In the Face of Tasks
    Not long ago, the Da Yao People's Commune Party Committee assigned three tasks related to current agricultural production: hoeing and weeding sweet potatoes, vigorously accumulating fertilizer, and eliminating vacant land. How to implement the decisions of the superior Party committee? The Party Branch Committee, headed by Yang Hongdian, does have a set of methods for following the mass line: Usually, the Party's decisions are first discussed separately with commune members representing various opinions, talking with them, and holding discussions with veteran farmers. They listened to the various reflections and opinions of the masses before making specific arrangements and implementing them. This time was no exception. He and several leading cadres of the Party Branch and Brigade first talked with veteran farmers. Some people had doubts about the "three guarantees" policy. Yang Hongdian, in response to the ideological concerns of the masses, cited specific examples, expounded the Party's policies, and conducted in-depth political and ideological work. From then on, the commune members were all in high spirits, offering suggestions to do a good job in the current three tasks. Veteran farmer Yang Xuyuan said that the sweet potato fields in the Shansia team are large, and hoeing and weeding are important; the sweet potato fields in the Cheshang and Tuwang teams are small, so fertilizer accumulation must be grasped; as for vacant land, large and small teams all have it, and a priority needs to be set according to the specific situation of each team. These words made Yang Hongdian realize a truth: "To implement the resolutions of the superior Party committee, we must be resolute, but not rigid. We must combine them with the specific circumstances of each production team and not force many things down at once." After a study by the cadre meeting, everyone said that the opinions of the veteran farmers were correct. Each production team arranged production according to different circumstances. The commune members saw that the tasks arranged by the cadres were practical, and that their rationalization proposals were supported and adopted by the Party Branch and Brigade, and their production enthusiasm was even higher. The commune members braved the heat, rushing to the distant fields, some even delivering meals to the distant fields. Hoeing and weeding sweet potatoes progressed particularly quickly, more fertilizer was accumulated, and vacant land was eliminated.
    Yang Hongdian is particularly good at grasping the hearts of the masses, mobilizing the masses, overcoming difficulties, and completing tasks. At the beginning of the spring plowing this year, the Shaluo Brigade suffered from drought, and only more than 300 mu of more than 2,000 mu of rice fields were plowed. In the face of this difficulty, some commune members held the idea that it was still early in the season, and they would wait for rain before plowing. Yang Hongdian, understanding the thoughts of the masses, took the lead in irrigating and plowing the fields, driving a part of the masses. However, most of the masses had not yet taken action. Coincidentally, at this time, the commune wanted the Shaluo Brigade to send people to the Yima Brigade to pick sweet potato seeds. Yang Hongdian used this opportunity to mobilize the production team leaders to open their eyes and sent them off, repeatedly urging them to take a good look at the drive of the fraternal brigade. As they walked, more than eighty commune members saw that the fraternal brigade had finished plowing some fields and were still plowing others for the second time. As they watched, everyone became anxious. Production team leader Liu Yihe, picked up the sweet potato seeds and rushed back without even taking a break to mobilize all of the team's more than one hundred laborers to irrigate and fight drought and plow the fields. Yang Hongdian seized this typical example, carried out propaganda and mobilization, and specifically helped commune members analyze the situation and discuss ways to overcome difficulties. In this way, the commune members quickly took action. The entire team was divided into more than fifty locations, starting four hundred waterwheels, and fought for forty days. Finally, like other brigades, they completed the task of transplanting early and mid-season rice a few days after Grain Rain, and also won the red flag of "Overcoming Natural Disasters" awarded by the commune.
    When building water conservancy projects, Yang Hongdian took the lead in living on the construction site, designing and surveying together with veteran farmers.
    Asking Water for Grain
    Now is the time for early rice to head. The fields of the Da Yao People's Commune are lush green, with clear water soaking every rice paddy. Today, the problem of water source for rice fields has been solved. But in the beginning, in order to develop water sources, Yang Hongdian led the masses in an unremitting struggle against nature.
    In the summer of 1957, when Yang Hongdian was still the head of the original Mingxing Advanced Cooperative. Just as they were rushing to transplant late rice, it hadn't rained for a long time, and more than one hundred mu of fields had no water to transplant. What to do? Yang Hongdian thought day and night about a solution, but for a long time, there were no results. One day, he was working with commune members when he saw a stream of water at the Caolou Dam, but because it was separated by the Liuli River, the water flowed into the river and was wasted. The masses sighed and said: "If only we could divert this stream of water across the river!" This wish of the masses was deeply imprinted in Yang Hongdian's heart. Is there really no way? He went to discuss with veteran farmers. Some people said: "A 22-zhang water flume should be built over the river, and a 5-li long dam should be built. But the most difficult thing is that to divert this stream of water, it must be diverted from under a water channel that irrigates 8,000 mu of fields. There are too many difficulties, and it is really difficult to do." For this matter, Yang Hongdian ran to the river and the canal to inspect every day, not knowing how much effort he put in. Finally, he considered a clue. He immediately convened a Party branch meeting for collective discussion, repeatedly researched, and separately discussed with the masses. Finally, a specific method was determined, and the branch's plan to build a channel across the Liuli River was proposed to all commune members, explaining that this was a fundamental measure to overcome drought and a move that would benefit future generations. Everyone enthusiastically discussed the construction plan. Yang Hongdian took the lead in living on the construction site, fighting day and night. He and veteran farmers measured and designed themselves. If there were no carpenters, they would do it themselves. In order for the water to pass under the channel, they boldly split a large camphor tree in half, buckled it under the channel, and built a solid culvert, ensuring the consolidation of the channel. After the hard work of all the commune members, a clear stream of water that had been wasted for many years now passed through the channel, crossed the big river, and irrigated 50,000 mu of drought-stricken rice fields.
    For many years, the commune members of the Shaluo Brigade had hoped to have their own oil press. Speaking of oil pressing, everyone said it was not easy. Each year they would spend an unknown amount of labor, carrying oilseed to oil presses tens of li away, spending effort not to mention losing a large amount of oil cake. Yang Hongdian deeply remembered the masses' demands and wishes, thinking of overcoming this difficulty. One day, he passed through Tuwangchong and saw a mountain stream as thick as a bucket, gushing down. This stream of water aroused his contemplation: mountain water could be used to build an oil press. He wandered by the water and on the mountain for several days in a row. Finally, he invited carpenter Li Hejia, oil press master Li Tangdian, veteran farmer Li Lianxi, and others to sit down and talk together. Everyone said that this stream of water never stopped all year round and could be used to build an oil press; they also added that a water mill could be set up in the oil press. It could be used for oil pressing when busy, and rice milling when idle. In this way, a decision was made. The carpenter was responsible for building oil pressing tools, and the oil press master was responsible for designing. That day, Yang Hongdian convened a meeting of commune members, explained the construction of the oil press, and publicly praised the carpenter, the oil press master, and the veteran farmer. Seeing that Yang Hongdian was thinking of them in every way, the masses offered their labor and materials. In a few days, the oil press and water mill were built.
    Fearing No Danger, Selflessly Helping Others
    Before the Spring Festival this year, the masses were busy preparing for the New Year, but he was still inspecting production. When he walked to the bank of the Liuli River, he found that the bridge had been washed away because the river had risen, and the ferry had also been washed downstream. Many passers-by gathered on both banks, unable to cross the river and anxious. Seeing this situation, Yang Hongdian quickly ran downstream, stepped into the biting river water, scooped out the accumulated water in the ferry, and drove the ferry, laboriously rowing against the water to the ferry. Braving the rapids, in the raging flood, he ferried people on both sides, one boat after another, to the other side. People were so moved at the time that they could not speak. This incident, like spring thunder, spread throughout the villages, arousing people's restless hearts. The next day, the first day of the Lunar New Year, a group of commune members came from all directions, voluntarily sacrificing their New Year's Day rest to ferry people. Commune members Li Lianxian and Li Lianchu came the earliest. When others were vying to ferry people, they always replied excitedly: "Learn from the Party Branch Secretary, and we will not rest until we ferry people for a day."
    One day in March this year, he went home to stay overnight. Just as he fell asleep, the wind blew the door of the house non-stop. He was shaken awake and rushed out of the house. It was pitch black outside, the wind was blowing non-stop, and spring thunder and lightning were intertwined. A storm was coming. Yang Hongdian rushed into the dark fields, running towards the Shaluo Brigade. At this time, he was thinking about the rice seeds that had just been sown in the mud three days ago. The words "protect seedlings as if protecting life" proposed by the Party organization rolled in his mind. Stumbling, he ran eight li in a row and came to the brigade headquarters, gasping for breath to call the weather station. As soon as he heard that there would be hail, his heart exploded. He hurriedly woke up the cadres at home, rocked the phones of each team himself, and picked up the local broadcast, climbing the highest local platform in the entire team, calling on the commune members to get up and protect the seedlings. Hearing his voice, the commune members rushed out, carrying their bedding and tools to set up sheds to protect the seedlings. He was still not at ease, braving the heavy rain, running through nine production teams. When he finished checking, it was dawn. The disaster was overcome, and he dragged his tired body back home. Just as he was about to eat breakfast, commune member Tang Heqi ran over in a hurry, saying that the water dam in front of the door team had been washed away by the flood. Yang Hongdian put down his unfinished meal and ran off into the heavy rain again. He ran around the fields, riverbanks, and ran to the edge of the dam, finding that the flood had washed a two-zhang wide gap in the dam, and the flood was still attacking the dam body. He immediately jumped into the water with the masses, plugging the breach again and again, until it was dark, completely overcoming the flood.
    Once, there was a flood. The water dam in front of the door team was breached by the flood. Yang Hongdian and the masses jumped into the flood to plug the breach.
    For the Wealth of All
    As a Communist Party member and a Party Branch Secretary, Yang Hongdian has done many things for the masses. But he never takes credit or is complacent. In life, he is simple and frugal, eating and dressing like the commune members, never spending a penny more. He also saves money for the masses from everywhere. A production brigade with 500 people has a monthly office expense of no more than ten yuan. Take lighting as an example, he always insists on using large lights for large meetings, small lights for small meetings, and no lights for discussions; the office paper is used on several sides; when writing slogans, he never uses paper or wood, but uses lime or red soil. He never spends a penny more no matter if he is attending meetings at the provincial, county, or commune level. In order to save the team car fare, he always walks to the county to attend meetings in non-emergency situations. When commune members talk about his hardworking and simple style, they jokingly say: "There is a Jiaoxi Ridge in Liuyang, seven li up and eight li down. If Secretary Yang grabs a handful of sesame seeds over the ridge, he is guaranteed not to lose one." This is used to describe his tight hand, thrift, financial management, and ability to be a housekeeper for commune members. When asked about his work achievements, he always says that without the Party, there would be no me, and everything depends on the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses. Indeed, Yang Hongdian came from a particularly poor background. Before liberation, he did not have an inch of land and relied on carrying goods and doing odd jobs to support his family. After liberation, he turned over, and under the education of the Party, he worked diligently and continuously for the masses. He regarded the difficulties and sufferings of the masses as his own difficulties and sufferings. When the commune unified leadership and decentralized management this year, the Party required people to be sent to the Shaluo Brigade, but some people said that Shaluo was poor and had poor conditions, and they were unwilling to come. He responded to the call of the Party and volunteered to come to Shaluo. Before leaving, the old commune members of the Mingxing Brigade, where he was originally located, all said: "Hongdian, you have worked hard for us until now. Here, there is no worry about drought or flood, we can eat our fill and sleep soundly. Don't you ask to return to your own team? So as not to go to Shaluo to suffer and be tired." Yang Hongdian said with a smile: "The masses in Shaluo are in difficulty and someone must help them overcome it. Under the education of the Party, we have learned some experience. Isn't it more appropriate for the Party to decide that I go to Shaluo?" In this way, he came to the Shaluo Brigade, diligently leading the masses, overcoming difficulties, conquering natural disasters, and changing the backward face of this brigade.
    The visit ended, and I repeatedly pondered a few words that a commune member said to me when talking about Yang Hongdian. He said: "As long as there is the leadership of the Party, and some Communist Party members like Yang Hongdian to be our heads of household, we are not afraid of any difficulties. We will definitely make our lives richer day by day!" (Attached picture)
