    The First Few Things
    One day in June, I went to interview Yang Hongdian. On the way, I kept thinking about a story I had heard before setting out: At the beginning of this year, a man dressed as a farmer arrived at the Shaluo Brigade of the Da Yao People's Commune in Liuyang County, Hunan Province. He went to the canteen, put down his luggage, and saw two cooks busy preparing food. The water tank was empty, so he picked up buckets, filled the tank; by the time the cooks noticed, he had already run to the pigsty and was busy cleaning up the accumulated manure. After cleaning the pig manure, he went to the fields to help commune member Li Shengyao with irrigating, chatting with him cordially while operating the waterwheel...
    Good news spreads especially quickly. In the evening, the commune members spread the word that the person who helped carry water, remove pig manure, and irrigate the fields during the day was the newly arrived Party Branch Secretary. These first few ordinary things deeply moved everyone. Some people came that night to personally recognize this hardworking person. When I arrived at the Shaluo Brigade office, Lao Yang was already out. The brigade secretary, knowing my purpose, asked: "Did you meet a tall person on the road, dressed in white, with blue cloth trousers, picking up manure?" I said I had met him and he was the first person I encountered picking up manure early in the morning. The secretary told me that the person was their Party Branch Secretary, Yang Hongdian. He gets up earlier than anyone else every day, getting up before dawn to pick up manure, all year round, without interruption. While picking up manure, he inspects the production and work of each production team. This is the first thing he does every day. He goes to the fields, carefully observes, and talks to cadres and the masses at any time. When he discovers problems, he relies on everyone to solve them on the spot, and the day's work is arranged. By the time his manure basket is heavily weighing down on his shoulders, he has roughly run more than ten miles, covering all nine production teams. Only then does he go to eat breakfast, and after breakfast, he goes to work with the commune members. "Where does he live and where does he work?" I asked the secretary doubtfully. He pointed to the four simple and unadorned civilian houses in front of him and said: "The staff of the Shaluo Brigade, including the secretary, accountant, warehouse keeper, and credit union, are all in this house. Secretary Yang himself doesn't want a separate office and has persuaded everyone not to put on airs, and that everything should be done simply.” It turned out that the desks and chairs here were all brought from their own homes. Yang Hongdian himself is even more of a role model, being frugal in everything. He doesn't have his own office, nor does he set up a separate bed, nor does he have a separate desk. He works wherever he is, lives, eats, and labors with the commune members. Meetings are mostly held on-site or in the homes of the masses, completely like a commune member. Everyone praised him and said: "Our leader is a 'guerrilla commander.'" The cadres also learned from his approach, going deep into the masses and taking root in the work teams.
    At the beginning of this year, a man dressed as a farmer arrived at the Shaluo Brigade of the Da Yao People's Commune in Liuyang County, Hunan Province. As soon as he put down his luggage, he helped the cooks carry water. He is Yang Hongdian, the newly arrived Party Branch Secretary of this brigade.
    In the Face of Tasks
    Not long ago, the Da Yao People's Commune Party Committee assigned three tasks related to current agricultural production: hoeing and weeding sweet potatoes, vigorously accumulating fertilizer, and eliminating vacant land. How to implement the decisions of the superior Party committee? The Party Branch Committee, headed by Yang Hongdian, does have a set of methods for following the mass line: Usually, the Party's decisions are first discussed separately with commune members representing various opinions, talking with them, and holding discussions with veteran farmers. They listened to the various reflections and opinions of the masses before making specific arrangements and implementing them. This time was no exception. He and several leading cadres of the Party Branch and Brigade first talked with veteran farmers. Some people had doubts about the "three guarantees" policy. Yang Hongdian, in response to the ideological concerns of the masses, cited specific examples, expounded the Party's policies, and conducted in-depth political and ideological work. From then on, the commune members were all in high spirits, offering suggestions to do a good job in the current three tasks. Veteran farmer Yang Xuyuan said that the sweet potato fields in the Shansia team are large, and hoeing and weeding are important; the sweet potato fields in the Cheshang and Tuwang teams are small, so fertilizer accumulation must be grasped; as for vacant land, large and small teams all have it, and a priority needs to be set according to the specific situation of each team. These words made Yang Hongdian realize a truth: "To implement the resolutions of the superior Party committee, we must be resolute, but not rigid. We must combine them with the specific circumstances of each production team and not force many things down at once." After a study by the cadre meeting, everyone said that the opinions of the veteran farmers were correct. Each production team arranged production according to different circumstances. The commune members saw that the tasks arranged by the cadres were practical, and that their rationalization proposals were supported and adopted by the Party Branch and Brigade, and their production enthusiasm was even higher. The commune members braved the heat, rushing to the distant fields, some even delivering meals to the distant fields. Hoeing and weeding sweet potatoes progressed particularly quickly, more fertilizer was accumulated, and vacant land was eliminated.
    Yang Hongdian is particularly good at grasping the hearts of the masses, mobilizing the masses, overcoming difficulties, and completing tasks. At the beginning of the spring plowing this year, the Shaluo Brigade suffered from drought, and only more than 300 mu of more than 2,000 mu of rice fields were plowed. In the face of this difficulty, some commune members held the idea that it was still early in the season, and they would wait for rain before plowing. Yang Hongdian, understanding the thoughts of the masses, took the lead in irrigating and plowing the fields, driving a part of the masses. However, most of the masses had not yet taken action. Coincidentally, at this time, the commune wanted the Shaluo Brigade to send people to the Yima Brigade to pick sweet potato seeds. Yang Hongdian used this opportunity to mobilize the production team leaders to open their eyes and sent them off, repeatedly urging them to take a good look at the drive of the fraternal brigade. As they walked, more than eighty commune members saw that the fraternal brigade had finished plowing some fields and were still plowing others for the second time. As they watched, everyone became anxious. Production team leader Liu Yihe, picked up the sweet potato seeds and rushed back without even taking a break to mobilize all of the team's more than one hundred laborers to irrigate and fight drought and plow the fields. Yang Hongdian seized this typical example, carried out propaganda and mobilization, and specifically helped commune members analyze the situation and discuss ways to overcome difficulties. In this way, the commune members quickly took action. The entire team was divided into more than fifty locations, starting four hundred waterwheels, and fought for forty days. Finally, like other brigades, they completed the task of transplanting early and mid-season rice a few days after Grain Rain, and also won the red flag of "Overcoming Natural Disasters" awarded by the commune.
    When building water conservancy projects, Yang Hongdian took the lead in living on the construction site, designing and surveying together with veteran farmers.
    Asking Water for Grain
    Now is the time for early rice to head. The fields of the Da Yao People's Commune are lush green, with clear water soaking every rice paddy. Today, the problem of water source for rice fields has been solved. But in the beginning, in order to develop water sources, Yang Hongdian led the masses in an unremitting struggle against nature.
    In the summer of 1957, when Yang Hongdian was still the head of the original Mingxing Advanced Cooperative. Just as they were rushing to transplant late rice, it hadn't rained for a long time, and more than one hundred mu of fields had no water to transplant. What to do? Yang Hongdian thought day and night about a solution, but for a long time, there were no results. One day, he was working with commune members when he saw a stream of water at the Caolou Dam, but because it was separated by the Liuli River, the water flowed into the river and was wasted. The masses sighed and said: "If only we could divert this stream of water across the river!" This wish of the masses was deeply imprinted in Yang Hongdian's heart. Is there really no way? He went to discuss with veteran farmers. Some people said: "A 22-zhang water flume should be built over the river, and a 5-li long dam should be built. But the most difficult thing is that to divert this stream of water, it must be diverted from under a water channel that irrigates 8,000 mu of fields. There are too many difficulties, and it is really difficult to do." For this matter, Yang Hongdian ran to the river and the canal to inspect every day, not knowing how much effort he put in. Finally, he considered a clue. He immediately convened a Party branch meeting for collective discussion, repeatedly researched, and separately discussed with the masses. Finally, a specific method was determined, and the branch's plan to build a channel across the Liuli River was proposed to all commune members, explaining that this was a fundamental measure to overcome drought and a move that would benefit future generations. Everyone enthusiastically discussed the construction plan. Yang Hongdian took the lead in living on the construction site, fighting day and night. He and veteran farmers measured and designed themselves. If there were no carpenters, they would do it themselves. In order for the water to pass under the channel, they boldly split a large camphor tree in half, buckled it under the channel, and built a solid culvert, ensuring the consolidation of the channel. After the hard work of all the commune members, a clear stream of water that had been wasted for many years now passed through the channel, crossed the big river, and irrigated 50,000 mu of drought-stricken rice fields.
    For many years, the commune members of the Shaluo Brigade had hoped to have their own oil press. Speaking of oil pressing, everyone said it was not easy. Each year they would spend an unknown amount of labor, carrying oilseed to oil presses tens of li away, spending effort not to mention losing a large amount of oil cake. Yang Hongdian deeply remembered the masses' demands and wishes, thinking of overcoming this difficulty. One day, he passed through Tuwangchong and saw a mountain stream as thick as a bucket, gushing down. This stream of water aroused his contemplation: mountain water could be used to build an oil press. He wandered by the water and on the mountain for several days in a row. Finally, he invited carpenter Li Hejia, oil press master Li Tangdian, veteran farmer Li Lianxi, and others to sit down and talk together. Everyone said that this stream of water never stopped all year round and could be used to build an oil press; they also added that a water mill could be set up in the oil press. It could be used for oil pressing when busy, and rice milling when idle. In this way, a decision was made. The carpenter was responsible for building oil pressing tools, and the oil press master was responsible for designing. That day, Yang Hongdian convened a meeting of commune members, explained the construction of the oil press, and publicly praised the carpenter, the oil press master, and the veteran farmer. Seeing that Yang Hongdian was thinking of them in every way, the masses offered their labor and materials. In a few days, the oil press and water mill were built.
    Fearing No Danger, Selflessly Helping Others
    Before the Spring Festival this year, the masses were busy preparing for the New Year, but he was still inspecting production. When he walked to the bank of the Liuli River, he found that the bridge had been washed away because the river had risen, and the ferry had also been washed downstream. Many passers-by gathered on both banks, unable to cross the river and anxious. Seeing this situation, Yang Hongdian quickly ran downstream, stepped into the biting river water, scooped out the accumulated water in the ferry, and drove the ferry, laboriously rowing against the water to the ferry. Braving the rapids, in the raging flood, he ferried people on both sides, one boat after another, to the other side. People were so moved at the time that they could not speak. This incident, like spring thunder, spread throughout the villages, arousing people's restless hearts. The next day, the first day of the Lunar New Year, a group of commune members came from all directions, voluntarily sacrificing their New Year's Day rest to ferry people. Commune members Li Lianxian and Li Lianchu came the earliest. When others were vying to ferry people, they always replied excitedly: "Learn from the Party Branch Secretary, and we will not rest until we ferry people for a day."
    One day in March this year, he went home to stay overnight. Just as he fell asleep, the wind blew the door of the house non-stop. He was shaken awake and rushed out of the house. It was pitch black outside, the wind was blowing non-stop, and spring thunder and lightning were intertwined. A storm was coming. Yang Hongdian rushed into the dark fields, running towards the Shaluo Brigade. At this time, he was thinking about the rice seeds that had just been sown in the mud three days ago. The words "protect seedlings as if protecting life" proposed by the Party organization rolled in his mind. Stumbling, he ran eight li in a row and came to the brigade headquarters, gasping for breath to call the weather station. As soon as he heard that there would be hail, his heart exploded. He hurriedly woke up the cadres at home, rocked the phones of each team himself, and picked up the local broadcast, climbing the highest local platform in the entire team, calling on the commune members to get up and protect the seedlings. Hearing his voice, the commune members rushed out, carrying their bedding and tools to set up sheds to protect the seedlings. He was still not at ease, braving the heavy rain, running through nine production teams. When he finished checking, it was dawn. The disaster was overcome, and he dragged his tired body back home. Just as he was about to eat breakfast, commune member Tang Heqi ran over in a hurry, saying that the water dam in front of the door team had been washed away by the flood. Yang Hongdian put down his unfinished meal and ran off into the heavy rain again. He ran around the fields, riverbanks, and ran to the edge of the dam, finding that the flood had washed a two-zhang wide gap in the dam, and the flood was still attacking the dam body. He immediately jumped into the water with the masses, plugging the breach again and again, until it was dark, completely overcoming the flood.
    Once, there was a flood. The water dam in front of the door team was breached by the flood. Yang Hongdian and the masses jumped into the flood to plug the breach.
    For the Wealth of All
    As a Communist Party member and a Party Branch Secretary, Yang Hongdian has done many things for the masses. But he never takes credit or is complacent. In life, he is simple and frugal, eating and dressing like the commune members, never spending a penny more. He also saves money for the masses from everywhere. A production brigade with 500 people has a monthly office expense of no more than ten yuan. Take lighting as an example, he always insists on using large lights for large meetings, small lights for small meetings, and no lights for discussions; the office paper is used on several sides; when writing slogans, he never uses paper or wood, but uses lime or red soil. He never spends a penny more no matter if he is attending meetings at the provincial, county, or commune level. In order to save the team car fare, he always walks to the county to attend meetings in non-emergency situations. When commune members talk about his hardworking and simple style, they jokingly say: "There is a Jiaoxi Ridge in Liuyang, seven li up and eight li down. If Secretary Yang grabs a handful of sesame seeds over the ridge, he is guaranteed not to lose one." This is used to describe his tight hand, thrift, financial management, and ability to be a housekeeper for commune members. When asked about his work achievements, he always says that without the Party, there would be no me, and everything depends on the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses. Indeed, Yang Hongdian came from a particularly poor background. Before liberation, he did not have an inch of land and relied on carrying goods and doing odd jobs to support his family. After liberation, he turned over, and under the education of the Party, he worked diligently and continuously for the masses. He regarded the difficulties and sufferings of the masses as his own difficulties and sufferings. When the commune unified leadership and decentralized management this year, the Party required people to be sent to the Shaluo Brigade, but some people said that Shaluo was poor and had poor conditions, and they were unwilling to come. He responded to the call of the Party and volunteered to come to Shaluo. Before leaving, the old commune members of the Mingxing Brigade, where he was originally located, all said: "Hongdian, you have worked hard for us until now. Here, there is no worry about drought or flood, we can eat our fill and sleep soundly. Don't you ask to return to your own team? So as not to go to Shaluo to suffer and be tired." Yang Hongdian said with a smile: "The masses in Shaluo are in difficulty and someone must help them overcome it. Under the education of the Party, we have learned some experience. Isn't it more appropriate for the Party to decide that I go to Shaluo?" In this way, he came to the Shaluo Brigade, diligently leading the masses, overcoming difficulties, conquering natural disasters, and changing the backward face of this brigade.
    The visit ended, and I repeatedly pondered a few words that a commune member said to me when talking about Yang Hongdian. He said: "As long as there is the leadership of the Party, and some Communist Party members like Yang Hongdian to be our heads of household, we are not afraid of any difficulties. We will definitely make our lives richer day by day!" (Attached picture)

    头几件事情
    6月的一天，我去访问杨宏典，走在路上反复地回味着出发前就听来的一件事：今年年初，湖南浏阳县大瑶公社沙螺大队新来了一位农民装束的人。他到了食堂，放下行李，看两个炊事员忙着做饭，水缸里没有水了，就挑起桶，担满了一缸水；等到炊事员发现，他已经跑到猪栏，又在忙着打扫猪栏里堆积的粪了。收拾完猪粪，他又到田里，帮社员李胜瑶车起水来，边车水，边亲切地交谈着。……
    好事传播得特别快。晚间，社员们就传开了，原来白天又帮挑水、又除猪粪、又帮车水的，就是新来的党总支书记。开头几件平凡的事情，却深深感动了大家。有些人当晚跑来要亲自认一认这位勤快的人。我赶到沙螺大队的办公处，老杨早已出外了，大队的秘书晓得我的来意后问道：你在路上碰见一个高个子，身着白衣，青布裤的拾粪的人没有？我说遇到过，是我所碰到的第一个早起拣粪的人。秘书告诉我，那人就是他们的总支书记杨宏典。他每天比谁都起得早，天不亮就起来拣粪，一年四季，从不间断。一边拣粪，一边巡视各个生产队的生产和工作。这就是他每天开头要办的事情。他走到田里，细心察看，随时找干部和群众交谈，发现问题，依靠大伙，就地解决，一天工作也就安排好了。等他的粪筐沉甸甸地压住肩头的时候，大致他已经跑过十多里路，跑遍了九个生产队了。这时，他才去吃早饭，吃完早饭又要去上工，与社员一起劳动。“那他在什么地方住，什么地方办公？”我怀疑地问秘书。他指着眼前四间简单朴素的民房说：“沙螺大队的工作人员，包括秘书、会计、保管、信用全都在这个房子里，杨书记自己不要单独的办公室，并且说服大家不要摆摊子，讲排场，一切都要因陋就简。”原来，这里的办公桌椅都是大家从自己家里搬来的。杨宏典本人更加以身作则，处处俭朴。他没有自己的办公室，又没有给自己另设床位，也没有单独摆办公桌子，工作到那里，就在那里办公。他生活在作业组，和社员同住、同吃、同劳动，开会也多在现场或群众家里，完全和社员一个样子。大家都称赞他说：“我们的领导是个‘游击司令’。”干部们也都学习了他的这种作法，纷纷深入群众，在作业组落脚生根。
    今年年初，湖南浏阳大瑶公社沙螺大队，来了一个农民装束的人。他一放下行李，就帮助炊事员挑水。他，就是这个大队新来的党总支书记杨宏典。
    在任务面前
    不久以前，大瑶公社党委布置了有关当前农业生产的三项任务：红薯中耕除草，大搞积肥，消灭空闲地。怎样贯彻上级党委的决定呢？以杨宏典为首的总支委员会，确实有一套走群众路线的办法：通常都是先把党的决定分头找代表各种不同意见的社员酝酿、交谈，跟老农座谈。听取群众的各种反映和意见，然后再具体布置、执行。这次也没有例外。他和党总支及大队的几个领导干部，事先与老农交谈。有人对“三包”政策有疑虑。杨宏典针对群众的思想顾虑，举出具体事例，阐述了党的政策，进行了深刻的政治思想工作。从此以后，社员个个情绪高涨，一齐为办好当前的三件事献策。老农杨绪耀说，山下队的红薯地多，中耕除草重要；车上队和土旺队红薯地少，积肥得抓紧；论到空闲地，大大小小队队都有，得按自己队的具体情况分个先后。这一席话，使杨宏典悟出了一个道理来，“贯彻上级党委的决议，要坚决，但不能刻板，要结合各生产队的具体情况进行，不能很多件事情一齐硬往下贯。”经过干部会议研究，大家都说老农提的意见正确。各生产队根据不同情况安排了生产，社员们看到干部布置的任务合乎实际，看到自己的合理化建议得到了党总支和大队的支持和采纳，生产情绪更加高涨了。社员们一个个冒着酷热，奔向远田，有的还把饭送到远田吃，红薯中耕除草进展特别快，肥料也积得多了，空闲地也消灭了。
    杨宏典特别善于抓住群众的心，发动群众，克服困难，完成任务。今年春耕开始，沙螺大队遭到干旱，两千多亩稻田只犁了三百多亩。在这个困难面前，一些社员抱着季节还早迟一点，等落雨再犁的思想。杨宏典了解了群众的思想情况，便带头车水犁田，带动了一部分群众。但是大部分群众还没有行动起来。恰巧，这时公社要沙螺大队派人到依马大队挑红薯种。杨宏典便利用这个机会，动员生产队长去开眼界，并送他们出发，一再叮嘱要多看看兄弟大队的干劲。八十多个社员一面走，一面看到兄弟大队有的田犁完了，有的还在犁第二遍。看着，看着，大家都急起来，生产队长刘宜和，挑上红薯种，连一次也没歇，就赶回来，动员全队一百多劳力车水抗旱犁田。杨宏典抓住这个典型，进行宣传鼓动，同时具体帮助社员分析情况，商量出战胜困难的办法。这样，社员很快就行动起来了。全队分了五十多处地方，开动四百部水车，奋战了四十天，终于和其他大队一样，在谷雨后几天完成了早、中稻插秧任务，还获得了公社奖给的“战胜自然灾害”的红旗。
    在兴修水利时，杨宏典带头住在工地，和老农一块设计，一块测量。
    向水要粮
    现在又是早稻抽穗的时节了。大瑶公社的田野里一片葱绿，清水浸润着每片稻田。今天，稻田的水源问题已经解决了。但当初，为了开辟水源，杨宏典却领导群众向大自然展开了不懈的斗争。
    1957年的夏天，那时杨宏典还是原明星高级社的社长。正当抢插晚稻时，久晴不雨，一百多亩田插秧没有水，怎么办呢？杨宏典日夜寻思着解决的办法，但很久没有结果。一天，他与社员一起劳动，看到槽楼坝有一股水，但因为隔着条浏醴河，水流入河中，白白走泄了。群众叹息地说：“能把这股水引过河就好了！”群众这个愿望，深深印在杨宏典心间。难道真的没办法吗？他去找老农商量，有人说：在河上架一条二十二丈的水枧，再修五里路长的水坝，但最难的要算引这股水必须从一条灌田八千亩的水道下面引渡过来，这样困难太多了，实在不好办。为了这件事情，杨宏典每天一个人跑到河边、渠上察看，不知费了多少心血，总算考虑到一个头绪。他马上召开党支部会集体讨论，反复研究，并分头去和群众商量。最后，才确定了具体办法，向全体社员提出支部的兴修一条跨浏醴河的渠道的方案。并且说明这是战胜干旱的根本措施，也是造福子孙万代的一举。大伙热烈讨论了施工计划。杨宏典带头住在工地，日夜奋战。自己和老农测量、设计。没木匠，自己干。为了使水从渠道底下通过，他们大胆地把一根大樟树劈成了两半，扣在渠下，架起了牢固的涵管，保证了渠道的巩固。经过全体社员的苦战，一股浪费了多年的清水，现在通过渠道，越过大河，灌溉着五万亩受旱的稻田。
    多少年来，沙螺大队的社员盼望自己有个榨油坊。提起榨油，大家都说不容易。一年不知要花多少劳动力，挑着油菜籽，跑到几十里路以外去榨油，花了工夫不说，还要少得大量的枯饼。群众的要求和愿望，杨宏典深深地记在心头。寻思着克服这个困难。一天，他从土旺冲过路，看到一股桶粗的山水，直泻而下，这股水引起了他的苦思：利用山水可以修榨油坊。他一连在水边、山上徘徊了几天。最后，邀请了木匠李和甲、榨油师李堂典、老农李廉喜等一起座谈。大家都说这股水一年四季不断，可以修建榨油坊；还补充说，在榨油坊设个水碾，忙时榨油，闲时还可碾米。就这样，作出了决定，木匠负责造榨油工具，榨油师负责设计。当天，杨宏典又召开了社员会，说明了修建榨油坊，当众表扬了木匠，榨师和老农。群众看到杨宏典处处为他们着想，都纷纷献工、献料。不几天，榨油坊和水碾就修好了。
    奋不顾身，舍己为人
    今年春节前夕，群众都忙着准备过年，他还在检查生产。当他走到浏醴河畔，发现因为河涨了水，冲垮了桥，渡过的船也被冲到下游去了。许多过路人拥集在两岸过不了河，急着没办法。杨宏典看了这个情景，很快奔向下游，踏进刺骨的河水，把渡船内的积水掏出来，驾起渡船，逆着水，吃力地划到渡口。冒着急流，在汹涌的洪水中，把两岸的人一船、一船渡到了对岸。人们当时感动得说不出话来。这件事像春雷一样，传遍了一个个村庄，激起了人们不平静的心。第二天，是大年初一，一群社员从四面八方赶来，自愿牺牲大年初一的休息，为大家摆渡。社员李廉先、李廉初来得最早，别人争着要摆渡时，他们总是激动地回答：向党总支书记学习，不渡一天不休息。
    今年3月的一天，他回家住宿。刚刚睡下，大风把房门吹的不住地响。他被震动得爬了起来，冲出家门。外面一团漆黑，大风不住地刮，春雷闪电交织，大风暴来临了。杨宏典冲进黑洞洞的田野，往沙螺大队奔跑。这时，他想着刚下泥三天的谷种，脑中翻滚着党组织提出的“保秧保苗如保命”的话，跌跌撞撞，一连跑了八里路，来到大队部，上气不接下气地给气象站打电话。一听说要下冰雹，心里像爆炸一样，他急忙喊醒在家的干部，自己摇了各队的电话，又拿起土广播，登上全队最高的土台，呼唤社员起来，护秧保苗。社员听到他的声音，个个都冲了出来了，拿着自己的被盖和工具，搭棚护秧。他还不放心，冒着大雨，跑遍九个生产队，等到检查完了，天也亮了。这场灾害被战胜了，他才拖着疲倦的身体回到家里。正要吃早饭时，社员汤和琪急忙跑来了，说门前队那座拦水坝被洪水冲垮了。杨宏典放下没吃完的饭，又冒着大雨奔跑去了。他绕着田垅、河岸，跑到了坝边，发现洪水已把坝冲开了两丈宽的口子，洪水还在突击着坝身。他立即和群众跳下水，一次又一次地堵筑缺口，直到天黑，彻底战胜了洪水。
    一次，洪水成灾。门前队的拦水坝被洪水突破了。杨宏典和群众一块跳下洪水，堵筑缺口。
    为了大伙都富裕
    杨宏典作为一个共产党员，一个总支书记，为群众作了许多事。但他从不居功自满。在生活上艰苦朴素。和社员一样吃、穿，从不多花一分钱。他还从一切地方为群众节约。一个管五百人口的生产大队，一月办公费从不超过十块钱。就拿点灯来说，他总是坚持开大会用大灯，开小会用小灯，座谈不用灯；办公的纸张都是翻几个边用；写标语，他从不用纸和木板，都是用石灰或红土。他不论到省、县、公社开会，从不多花一个钱。为了给队里节约汽车费，他在非紧急的情况下到县里开会，总是步行。社员谈起他艰苦朴素的作风时，打趣地说：浏阳有个蕉溪岭，上七里，下八里，杨书记如果抓一把芝麻过岭，保险不会丢一粒。用来形容他手紧，勤俭，会理财，会为社员当家。一提起工作的成绩，他总是说，没有党就没有我，一切都是靠党的领导和群众的支持。的确，杨宏典出身特别穷苦。解放前他没有一分田地，靠挑脚、做短工，维持一家人的生活。解放后，他翻了身，在党的教育下，勤勤恳恳，不断努力，为群众办事。他把群众的困难，群众的疾苦，当作自己的困难和疾苦。当今年公社统一领导，分级管理时，党要求派人到沙螺大队，但一些人说沙螺地方穷，条件差，不愿来，他响应了党的号召，自愿来沙螺。临行前，原来他所在的明星大队老社员都说，宏典，你辛辛苦苦为我们搞到现在，这里水旱无忧，吃得饱，睡得着了，你不请求回到本队来吗？免得到沙螺吃苦受累。杨宏典笑着说：沙螺群众困难，总得要人帮助克服，在党教育下，咱们学到一些经验，党决定自己去沙螺不是更合适吗？就这样，他来到了沙螺大队，兢兢业业地带领群众，克服困难，战胜了自然灾害，改变了这个大队的落后面貌。
    访问结束了，我又反复地思索着一个社员对我谈起杨宏典时的几句话，他说：“只要有党的领导，有像杨宏典一样的一些共产党员给我们作当家人，天大的困难，我们也不怕。我们一定会使我们的生活一天更比一天富裕！”（附图片）
