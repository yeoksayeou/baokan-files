Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: The Ambassador of the Mongolian People's Republic to China, Sharav, held a reception this evening to celebrate the 38th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution.

    In their speeches at the reception, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Ambassador Sharav spoke happily about the great achievements of the Mongolian people in building socialism, expressed the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples, and highlighted the close cooperation and mutual support between the two peoples in the common cause of building socialism and in the struggle against common enemies.

    In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended warm festive greetings to the Mongolian government and people. He said that the hardworking and simple Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Mongolian government, have carried out a heroic struggle for the great cause of building socialism. Over the past thirty-eight years, the Mongolian people have overcome many difficulties and finally transformed a backward pastoral country into an agricultural-pastoral-industrial nation. Today's Mongolia has changed its past face, and the emerging industry has been continuously developed, and the individual and scattered animal husbandry has been collectivized. Now, on the basis of successfully completing two five-year plans, the Mongolian people are enthusiastically working to realize the new three-year plan with full confidence. The Chinese people are elated by the achievements of the Mongolian people in building socialism and wish them continued and even more brilliant victories.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that the Chinese and Mongolian peoples have a traditional friendship. We are close brothers in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. Our two peoples have always cooperated closely and supported each other in international affairs and in the struggle against common enemies. We are deeply convinced that in the common cause of building socialism, the mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries will be further developed, and the friendship between our two peoples will be further strengthened and consolidated.

    At the beginning of the reception, Ambassador Sharav excitedly introduced to hundreds of Chinese and foreign guests the brilliant achievements of the Mongolian people in socialist construction. The Ambassador said that our country has developed from a backward animal husbandry country into an agricultural-pastoral-industrial country, and modern socialist heavy industry, light industry, transportation, and postal and telecommunications industries are developing rapidly. All herdsmen have joined cooperatives, and agricultural and pastoral cooperatives are equipped with modern machinery. Our agricultural and animal husbandry products are increasing day by day, and the living standards of the people are constantly improving. In his speech, the Ambassador expressed his gratitude to the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries for their assistance to Mongolia's construction. Speaking of Mongolia's foreign relations, the Ambassador said that the Mongolian People's Republic has always pursued a peaceful and friendly foreign policy and is willing to establish peaceful and friendly relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council for calling for a "Mongolia Day" to support the Mongolian People's Republic's accession to the United Nations, as well as to all countries and people who support the Mongolian People's Republic.

    Among those present at tonight's reception were Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Peng Zhen, and Lin Feng; Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee Huang Kecheng; Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Bao Erhan; Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei; President of the China-Mongolia Friendship Association Zhang Zhixiang; responsible persons of various departments of our national state organs, people's organizations, and democratic parties; as well as diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China.
