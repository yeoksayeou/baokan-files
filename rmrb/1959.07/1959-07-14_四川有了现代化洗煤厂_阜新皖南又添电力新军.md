    Sichuan Has a Modern Coal Washing Plant
    Fuxin and Southern Anhui Add New Electric Power Forces
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Sichuan Province's first modern coal washing plant has recently been completed.

    This coal washing plant is built in the Jiayang Coal Mine and has three main workshops: crushing, washing, and dewatering, all of which are mechanized. It can wash 300,000 tons of raw coal annually; according to design requirements, the refined coal it washes has an ash content below 20% and a sulfur content below 0.4%.
    According to Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The newly installed No. 6 50,000 kW steam turbine generator set at the Fuxin Power Plant started generating electricity on the 3rd. Liaoning Province's industrial production departments will receive 1.2 million kilowatt-hours of electricity from it every day.

    The newly installed steam turbine generator set is a high-temperature, high-pressure power generation facility. During the installation process, workers particularly strengthened quality management, so the boiler, turbine, generator body, and auxiliary equipment all started successfully on the first attempt, and the trial operation went very well.
    This Newspaper Report: The first 6,000 kW generator of the second phase expansion project of the Ma'anshan Power Plant officially generated electricity at 4:00 AM on June 23rd, and the strong electricity has been connected to the Southern Anhui power grid. It will play a certain role in promoting the development of steel production in the Ma'anshan area. (Attached picture)

    新华社讯　四川省第一座现代化洗选厂在最近建成。
    这个洗选厂建设在嘉阳煤矿，有破碎、洗选、脱水等三个主要车间，全部是机械化操作。它一年可以入洗三十万吨原煤；按照设计要求，它洗选出来的精煤，灰分在20％以下，硫分在0.4％以下。
    据新华社讯　阜新发电厂新安装的第六号五万瓩汽轮发电机组，在3日开始发电。辽宁省工业生产部门每天将从它得到一百二十万度电的供应。
    新安装的汽轮发电机组是高温高压的发电设备。在安装工程中，工人们特别加强了质量管理，因此锅炉、汽轮机、发电机本体和附属设备都是一次启动成功，试运转的情况很好。
    本报讯　马鞍山发电厂第二期扩建工程的第一台六千瓩发电机，在6月23日清晨四时正式发电，强大的电力已经并入皖南电力网。它对促进马鞍山地区的钢铁生产的发展将起一定作用。（附图片）
