Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 11th: Romanian Foreign Minister Corneliu Mănescu, in an interview with a reporter from "Neues Deutschland," stated that the positive contributions made by the German Democratic Republic through its delegation were in the interests of the entire German people and world peace, and further demonstrated the importance of the German Democratic Republic as a factor for peace and security in Europe.

The Foreign Minister said that the first phase of the Geneva Conference showed that the West German militarist clique had resolutely tried to obstruct the Soviet Union from reaching an agreement with Western countries. He pointed out that during the conference, the work of equipping the West German armed forces with atomic weapons and rockets, as well as West Germany's militaristic-revanchist activities, had intensified. He said that it was obvious that West German militarists had not learned a lesson from the defeats of the two world wars.

He said that the Romanian government's statement on guaranteeing peace through a Balkan collective security treaty had been warmly received by other Balkan countries. The Romanian government fully supported the Soviet Union's statement on establishing a nuclear-free zone in the Balkans and the Adriatic region. Mănescu said that he hoped that the governments of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in the region would adopt a more realistic attitude towards these issues than before, and together with the Soviet Union, guarantee that the Balkans and the Adriatic region become a nuclear-free zone.

He said that the Romanian government will continue to work to achieve collective security in Southeast Europe, because it knows that this is beneficial to the Romanian people, world peace, and international cooperation.

    罗马尼亚外长发表谈话
    谴责西德阻挠外长会议
    新华社柏林11日电　罗马尼亚外交部长布纳丘在向“新德意志报”记者谈到日内瓦外长会议时说，德意志民主共和国通过它的代表团所作的积极贡献是符合整个德国人民和世界和平的利益的，并且进一步证明了德意志民主共和国作为欧洲和平与安全因素的重要性。
    这位外交部长说，日内瓦会议第一阶段表明，西德军国主义集团曾坚决设法阻挠苏联同西方国家达成协议。他指出，在会议期间，用原子武器和火箭武器装备西德武装部队的工作，以及西德的军国主义——复仇主义活动都加紧了。他说，很明显，西德军国主义者没有从两次世界大战的失败中得到教训。
    他说，罗马尼亚政府发表的关于通过巴尔干集体安全条约来保障和平的声明，得到了其他巴尔干国家的热烈响应。罗马尼亚政府完全支持苏联发表的关于在巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区建立无原子武器地区的声明。布纳丘说，他希望这个地区的北大西洋公约组织国家政府对这些问题采取比以前现实的态度，并同苏联一起保证使巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区成为无原子武器地区。
    他说，罗马尼亚政府将继续努力来实现东南欧的集体安全，因为它知道，这是有利于罗马尼亚人民、世界和平和国际合作的。
