    Timely Rain
    Rain falls in time, and seedlings thrive. When people's thoughts have problems, timely solutions can constantly inspire enthusiasm. Because of good production in the Shiyang Commune, some commune members and cadres began to develop complacency. The commune Party committee immediately gave this kind of thinking a drizzle, washing away the dust of complacency and rekindling the drive that was about to slacken, making production even more outstanding than before. This rain fell very timely.
    The rain of resolving ideological problems needs to fall in time and be just right, which is not easy. This requires leaders to deeply observe the situation, understand the changing circumstances at all times, think what the masses think, see what the masses see, and also think deeper and see further than them.
    Therefore, leaders also need to live among the masses, breathe the same air, eat and live together with them, and truly become one with them. Only in this way can problems be known and solved early.
    It is hoped that Party workers will always pay attention to this kind of timely rain, and constantly solve the ideological problems of the masses anytime and anywhere, encouraging people to move forward forever.

    及时雨
    雨下及时，禾苗旺。人的思想，一有问题，及时解决，就能不断鼓舞干劲。石羊公社由于生产好，部分社员和干部开始滋长自满情绪，公社党委马上给这种思想下了点毛毛雨，洗去了自满的灰尘，把将要松下去的干劲，又给鼓了起来，使生产比以前搞得更出色了。这雨下得很及时。
    解决思想问题的雨，要下得及时，下得恰到火候，也不很容易。这需要领导者深入观察形势，时时了解变化着的情况，想群众所想的，看群众所看的，还要比他们想得深、看得远一些。
    因此，也就需要领导者经常生活在群众中，和他们同呼吸，共食宿，真正打成一片。只有如此，才能有问题早知道，早解决。
    希望党的工作者，时时注意下这种及时雨，随时随地经常不断地解决群众中的思想问题，鼓舞人们永远前进。
