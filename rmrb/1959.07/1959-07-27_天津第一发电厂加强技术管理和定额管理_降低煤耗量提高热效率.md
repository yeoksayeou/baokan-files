Tianjin, July 26 (Reporter from this newspaper) Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant, relying on the masses, has strengthened technical management and coal consumption quota management, and launched a mass campaign to save coal. In the first half of this year, the average coal consumption per kilowatt-hour was 0.461 kg of standard coal, a decrease of 29 grams compared with the same period last year, saving a total of more than 16,000 tons of coal. As a result, the plant has become one of the power plants with the lowest unit coal consumption among the medium-pressure units in the country.

In the past, there were many combustibles in the fly ash of the plant's boilers, and there was also a phenomenon of coal powder flowing out, with a lot of coal flowing out of the chimney with the fly ash in a few minutes. The Party Committee of the plant strengthened ideological education on saving coal for the workers and organized a boiler combustion research association with the participation of leading cadres, veteran workers, and technicians to regularly analyze and study boiler technical management issues, solve problems existing in combustion, summarize and promote advanced experiences, improve the thermal efficiency of turbines, boilers, and the entire plant, and reduce various heat losses. Since the beginning of this year, they have mobilized the masses to summarize and promote the "five-stability operation method of boiler combustion" (adjusting the coal feeding baffle to be stable, the outlet temperature of the pulverizer to be stable, the air pressure of the pulverizing system to be stable, the speed of coal powder feeding to be stable, and adjusting the air door to be stable), so that the coal and air are evenly supplied to the boiler, and the degree of coal combustion is high, so that the average combustible matter in the ash is reduced from 3.5% to 1.5%, and the flue gas temperature is reduced by about 10 degrees, reducing heat loss and increasing boiler efficiency by 0.5%, which can save more than 2,400 tons of coal throughout the year. In order to maintain the furnace temperature and save coal, the plant also mobilized workers to divide the work by branch plant, team, and group to solve problems such as air leakage, steam leakage, heat leakage, and water leakage at any time.

In order to better reduce coal consumption, the plant strengthened coal consumption quota management, stipulating coal consumption indicators, ash combustible matter indicators, boiler efficiency indicators, and flue gas temperature indicators. Each team and group conducts economic activity analysis on time and on a daily basis based on the implementation of various indicators, finds problems at any time, proposes solutions, announces them to the masses, and points out the direction for improving thermal efficiency. The plant department conducts comprehensive analysis on a weekly, ten-day, and monthly basis based on the team's analysis, and timely guides the plant's production and coal saving work. The plant also mobilized the masses to carry out technical revolution, improve equipment, and repair machinery and equipment on a scheduled basis to eliminate equipment defects in order to reduce coal consumption. Now, the entire plant has basically achieved "major defects not exceeding the day, minor defects not exceeding the shift."

The plant has seven branch plants, including boiler, transportation, chemical, electrical, turbine, maintenance, and thermal engineering. Each branch plant implements the spirit of serving the boiler branch plant in everything, strengthens collaboration, and jointly finds ways to reduce boiler coal consumption. For example, the workers in the transportation branch plant often solicit opinions from the boiler branch plant to improve their work and ensure uniform coal delivery; the chemical branch plant tests water and coal ash at any time, so that the boiler branch plant workers can improve their operation in time according to the test analysis; the workers in the turbine branch plant actively find ways to improve the vacuum degree and reduce gas consumption in order to save coal. Now, the average steam required per kilowatt-hour in this branch plant has been reduced by about 4% compared with the past.

The plant's workers launched "learn from, compare with, and catch up with" competitions between branch plants and teams around saving coal. For example, the workers of Team Ding of Boiler No. 4 reduced the combustible matter in the ash from about 8% last year to 1.25%. Their achievements were quickly valued by the workers of the entire plant, and a upsurge of learning from Team Ding and catching up with Team Ding was immediately set off. They also humbly learned from the advanced experience of fraternal plants. In the first half of this year, after the boiler branch plant learned the experience of "bridge-shaped air opening" and "closing the tertiary air" from Fuxin Power Plant, the excess air in the furnace was reduced, and the flue gas temperature was reduced by 5 to 10 degrees. This item alone can save more than 1,700 tons of coal throughout the year.

While vigorously reducing coal consumption, the plant also paid close attention to safe production, and put forward the slogan of "safe power generation, uninterrupted every second" at the beginning of this year, and launched a "four-no" safe production competition of no accidents, no obstacles, no minor personal injuries, and no abnormal phenomena. In the first half of this year, 70% of the production teams achieved 100 days of production without abnormal phenomena. In the first half of this year, the plant not only saved a large amount of coal, but also overfulfilled the production plan by 13.76%; the average cost per thousand kilowatt-hours was also reduced from 14.78 yuan last year to 12.44 yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 5th. Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant is making great efforts to save coal by mobilizing the masses. Workers are taking various measures to expand the utilization of low-quality coal. At present, the utilization of low-quality coal has reached more than 50% of the plant's coal consumption. The picture shows workers in the chemical specialty taking samples for testing, and according to different coal qualities, promptly notifying the workers in the boiler room of the matters that should be paid attention to.

    天津第一发电厂加强技术管理和定额管理
    降低煤耗量  提高热效率
    本报天津26日电　天津第一发电厂依靠群众，加强技术管理和耗煤定额管理，开展群众性节约煤炭活动。今年上半年平均每发一度电消耗标准煤零点四六一公斤，比去年同期减少二十九克，共节约煤炭一万六千多吨。这个厂因此成为全国中压机组发电厂单位耗煤量最低的一个厂。
    这个厂过去锅炉的烟灰中有不少可燃物，同时有煤粉自流现象，几分钟内就有不少煤从烟囱中随着烟灰流失出去。这个厂的党委会对职工加强了节约煤炭的思想教育，组织了有领导干部、老工人和技术人员参加的锅炉燃烧研究会，定期分析研究锅炉技术管理问题，解决燃烧中存在的问题，总结和推广先进经验，提高汽轮机、锅炉及全厂的热效率，减少各种热的损失。今年以来，他们发动群众总结推广了“锅炉燃烧五稳操作法”（调整给煤档板稳，磨煤机出口温度稳，制粉系统风压稳，给煤粉速度稳和调整风门稳），做到给锅炉送煤、送风均匀，煤的燃烧程度高，使灰中可燃物平均由3.5％降低到1.5％，使排烟温度降低十度左右，减少了热损失，锅炉效率提高0.5％，全年共可节约煤炭二千四百多吨。为了保持炉膛温度，节约用煤，这个厂还发动职工按分场、班、组分工包干，随时注意解决漏风、漏汽、漏热、漏水等问题。
    为了更好地降低煤耗，这个厂加强了用煤定额管理，规定了煤耗指标、灰中可燃物指标、锅炉效率指标和排烟温度等指标。每一个班、组都按时、按日根据各项指标实现情况，进行经济活动分析，随时发现问题，提出解决办法，向群众公布，指出提高热效率的方向。厂部按周、按旬、按月根据班组分析情况，进行综合分析，及时指导全厂的生产和节约煤炭的工作。这个厂还发动群众大搞技术革命，改进设备，有计划地按期检修机器设备，消除设备缺陷，以降低耗煤量。现在，全厂已经基本上作到了“大缺陷不过天，小缺陷不过班”。
    这个厂共有锅炉、运输、化学、电气、汽轮机、检修和热工等七个分场。各分场贯彻一切为锅炉分场服务的精神，加强协作，共同设法降低锅炉耗煤量。如运输分场的职工经常征求锅炉分场的意见，改进自己的工作，作到送煤均匀；化学分场随时化验水煤灰分，使锅炉分场工人能及时根据化验分析情况改进操作；汽轮机分场的职工积极设法提高真空度，降低气耗，以节约用煤，现在这个分场平均每度电所需要蒸汽，比过去降低了4％左右。
    这个厂的职工围绕着节约用煤开展了分场之间、班组之间的“学比赶”竞赛。如四号锅炉丁班的工人使灰中可燃物由去年的8％左右降低到1.25％，他们的成就很快受到全场工人的重视，立即掀起了学丁班赶丁班的热潮。他们还虚心学习兄弟厂的先进经验。今年上半年锅炉分场学习了阜新发电厂的“桥形开风”和“关小三次风”的经验后，减少了炉内过剩空气量，降低排烟温度五到十度，仅这一项全年就可节约煤炭一千七百多吨。
    在大力降低煤耗的同时，这个厂对安全生产也抓得很紧，今年年初就提出“安全发电，分秒不停”的口号，开展了无事故、无障碍、无人身轻伤、无异常现象的“四无”安全生产竞赛。今年上半年，70％的生产小组作到百日生产无异常现象。这个厂上半年既节约了大量煤炭，又超额13.76％完成了生产计划；平均每千度电的成本也由去年的十四点七八元，降低到十二点四四元。（附图片）
