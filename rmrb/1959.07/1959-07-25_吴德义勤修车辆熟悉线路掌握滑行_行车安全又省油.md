Wu Deyi Diligently Repairs Vehicles, Familiar With Routes, Masters Gliding: Safe Driving and Fuel Saving

    (Our Newspaper) Wuhan – Wu Deyi, a driver of vehicle No. 198 from the Hankou Second Station of the Wuhan City Automotive Transportation Company, has achieved excellent results by finding ways to reduce vehicle fuel consumption from all aspects.

    In April of this year, Wu Deyi broke the national record for lowest vehicle fuel consumption for the first time with 13.37 liters per hundred vehicle kilometers. In May and June, he continuously broke his own record with 13.1 liters and 11.45 liters per hundred vehicle kilometers, respectively. Wu Deyi not only saves fuel but also hauls more, drives safely, and maintains the vehicle well. In June, he completed 112.54% of the transportation turnover volume, maintained a 100% vehicle integrity rate, and reduced the transportation cost per ton of cargo from 12 fen in April to 6.5 li.

    Wu Deyi only started working as a driver in the autumn of 1956. He drives an old 1939 Chevrolet (with two trailers), the engine life of which had long exceeded its service life. Due to the age of the vehicle and his lack of technical proficiency, the average fuel consumption at the beginning was 25.95 liters per hundred vehicle kilometers, far exceeding the company's stipulated fuel consumption standard. Through diligent study and learning from the operational experience of others, Wu Deyi created a set of fuel-saving methods for operation and maintenance, and fuel consumption gradually decreased. From April 1957 to April 1959, Wu Deyi saved 3,506 liters of gasoline.

    Wu Deyi's experience is based first and foremost on consistently emphasizing fuel conservation ideologically. He also regularly performs meticulous maintenance on vehicles, practicing three diligences (diligent washing, diligent inspection, diligent repair), three priorities (slow first, yield first, stop first), two don'ts (don't overtake forcefully, don't drive "heroically," maintain medium speed), and one concentration (high degree of mental concentration). He is familiar with routes, appropriately masters gliding, and avoids stepping on the accelerator pedal violently. He also pays attention to avoiding empty runs, actively organizes circular transportation, actively assists loading and unloading workers, and insists on towing trailers.

    The Hankou Second Station of the Wuhan Transportation Company has organized a "Wu Deyi Fuel Saving Technology Training Class." This is Wu Deyi (first person on the left) enthusiastically explaining to his colleagues how to operate to save gasoline.

    吴德义勤修车辆熟悉线路掌握滑行
    行车安全又省油
    本报讯　武汉市汽车运输公司汉口二站198号汽车司机吴德义，从各方面设法降低汽车耗油量，获得了优异的成绩。
    今年4月间，吴德义以每百车公里耗油十三点三七公升，首次突破全国汽车耗油量最低纪录；5月和6月份，他又以每百车公里耗油十三点一公升、十一点四五公升连续刷新了自己的纪录。吴德义不仅作到用油省，而且拖得多，行驶安全，车辆保养好。6月份完成运输周转量112.54％；完好车率100％；每吨货运输成本从4月份的一角二分降低到六分五厘。
    吴德义是1956年秋天才开始作汽车司机的。他驾驶的是1939年出厂的老式雪佛兰牌汽车（加挂两个拖车），机器寿命早已超过使用年限。由于车子陈旧，加上技术不熟练，因此接手之初耗油量平均每百车公里达到二十五点九五公升，大大超过公司规定的耗油标准。经过刻苦钻研，学习别人操作的经验，吴德义创造了一套操作保养的节油方法，耗油量逐渐下降。从1957年4月到1959年4月两年间，吴德义节约的汽油就达三千五百零六公升。
    吴德义的经验，首先是从思想上一贯重视节约用油，并经常对车辆作精细的维修保养，做到三勤（勤洗、勤检、勤修），三先（先慢、先让、先停），二不（不强行超车、不开“英雄”车，保持中速行驶），一集中（思想高度集中）；熟悉线路，适当掌握滑行，不猛轰油门。他还注意不让车子跑空，主动组织循环运输，积极协助装卸工人装车卸车，坚持拖带挂车。
    中共武汉市委向全市推广了吴德义节约用油安全行驶的经验，现在已经收到显著效果。　（徐奔）（附图片）
    武汉市运输公司汉口二站已组织了一个“吴德义书油技术训练班”。这是吴德义（左第一人）热情地向同伴们讲解怎样操作才能节约汽油。
