    Guaranteeing Teachers Devote Most of Their Time to Teaching
    Zhaodong Comprehensively and Rationally Arranges Work for Primary and Secondary School Teachers

    (Our dispatch) In order to comprehensively and deeply implement the Party's education policy and improve the quality of teaching, primary and secondary schools in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, have made comprehensive arrangements for teachers' work, overcoming the past phenomenon of teachers being too busy and disorganized. A new atmosphere of careful lesson preparation and meticulous teaching has been formed in teaching.

    In order to rationally arrange teachers' work, many schools have adopted the method of combining leadership and the masses, conducted extensive airing of views, big debates, and detailed investigations and research, as well as careful accounting, and re-compiled "work schedules," unifying teachers' teaching, productive labor, and study. After comprehensively arranging work, Zhaodong No. 1 Middle School and Sanyou Primary School have stabilized teachers' daily work and study time at around nine hours, with more than 80% of that time spent on teaching work. It is also guaranteed that teachers have four hours of political theory study and four to six hours of cultural study time each week. Most of the spare time and Sundays are also basically not occupied and are at the disposal of the teachers themselves.

    While comprehensively arranging teachers' work, the leadership style of the schools has also greatly improved. Party and government leaders frequently go deep into classes, teaching and research groups, and among teachers to specifically help teachers solve problems and improve teaching work. Now, the number of meetings in various schools has been greatly reduced, overcoming the past phenomenon of too many meetings and too long a time. Zhaodong No. 1 Middle School's arrangement is to hold only one meeting with all teachers participating each week, and to control the meeting time within two to three hours. At the same time, all schools have paid attention to improving the quality of meetings, emphasizing preparation before meetings. Problems that can be solved by individual connections should not be met, and small meetings should be held instead of large meetings if possible.

    In addition, thanks to the attention of the Party committee, some unnecessary activities have been greatly reduced, and the phenomenon of other departments arbitrarily assigning work directly to schools has been basically brought under control. The social activities that teachers participate in have been appropriately arranged uniformly by the Party committee, so that social activities do not affect the school's teaching work as much as possible.

    After the comprehensive arrangement, teachers' work has become more planned. Teachers can work and rest rhythmically. Some teachers reflected: "In the past, we didn't care whether we started at 8:30, but now everyone cherishes time, competes for every second, and completes work tasks on time." Many teachers have also summarized their experience and improved their working methods in accordance with the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work. For example, some teachers first put forward clear requirements when assigning homework, pointing out the methods for students to complete the homework. Before correcting the homework, the teacher first makes an accurate answer, and then corrects it according to the student's level, achieving accuracy and speed, and reducing errors. Due to the increase in lesson preparation time, teachers' research on teaching materials has become more and more in-depth and meticulous. At the same time, teachers can also free up more time to do a good job in homeroom teacher work, thereby strengthening political and ideological education.

    保证教师大部时间致力教学
    肇东全面合理安排中小学教师工作
    本报讯　黑龙江省肇东县中小学为了全面深入贯彻党的教育方针，提高教学质量，对教师工作进行了全面安排，克服了教师过去的忙乱现象。在教学上形成了认真备课，精心讲课的新风气。
    为了合理安排教师工作，许多学校采取了领导与群众相结合的方法，进行了大鸣大放大辩论和细致的调查研究、算细账等一系列的工作，重新编制了“工作时间表”，把教师的教学、生产劳动和学习做了统一安排。肇东一中和三友小学经过全面安排工作，使教师全日工作和学习时间稳定在九小时左右，其中在教学工作上的时间占80％以上。并且保证教师每周有四小时的政治理论学习和四至六小时的文化学习时间。大部分业余时间和星期日也基本上不被占用，由教师自己支配。
    在全面安排教师工作的同时，学校领导作风也随着有了很大改进。党政领导同志经常深入班级、深入教研组、深入教师中去，具体帮助教师解决问题，改进教学工作。现在，各个学校的会议已大大减少，克服了过去会议过多和时间过长的现象。肇东一中的安排是，每周只召开一次有全体教师参加的会议，并把会议时间控制在二至三小时以内。同时，各学校都注意了提高会议质量，强调会前做好准备。个别串连能解决的问题一律不开会，小会能解决的不开大会。
    此外，由于党委的重视，一些不必要的活动已大大减少，其他各部门随意直接向学校布置工作的现象已基本上得到控制。教师参加的社会活动，由党委统一作了适当安排，使社会活动尽可能不影响学校教学工作。
    经过全面安排以后，教师的工作计划性加强了。教师们都能有节奏地进行工作和休息。有的教师反映：“过去干不干八点半，现在人人都珍惜时间，分秒必争，按时完成工作任务。”许多教师还根据苦干、实干、巧干的精神，总结了经验，改进了工作方法。比如有些教师在布置作业时，首先提出明确的要求，指出学生完成作业的方法。并在批改作业之前，教师先作出准确的答案，然后按学生程度分类批改，做到了又准又快，少出错误。由于备课时间的增加，教师对教材的研究就越来越深入细致了。同时教师也能腾出更多的时间去做好班主任工作，从而加强了政治思想教育。
