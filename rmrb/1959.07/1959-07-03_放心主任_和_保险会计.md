“Reassuring Director” and “Insurance Accountant”
    Yao Wenjin

    Jia Linmao, the Party Branch Secretary of the Nanbali Management District of Weiyuanpu People's Commune in Zuoyun County, Shanxi Province, and Zhao Guofu, the accountant, have jointly managed public finances for five years since serving as the director and accountant of the original Qigan Agricultural Cooperative (now a production team in the Nanbali Management District). They have kept clear accounts and proper procedures, with low expenses and costs, and the masses are satisfied, calling them "Reassuring Director" and "Insurance Accountant."

    Both men are fifty years old this year, born in the same year and month; one lives in Qigan Village, and the other lives in Sunjiabao; one worked as a long-term laborer for more than twenty years, and the other was a peasant for most of his life; one is a Communist Party member, and the other is a non-Party activist. In the spring of 1954, when Qigan Village and Sunjiabao, which were one li apart, jointly established an agricultural cooperative (now the forty-three peasant households in these two villages have moved to live together), they were simultaneously elected as director and accountant. Since then, common ideals and common struggles have closely united them. From the establishment of the elementary cooperative in 1954 to its transformation into a people's commune in 1958, for a full five years, the financial accounts of the Qigan cooperative (team) under their management have never had a single error, and the procedures for dealings with the state and cooperative members have never been careless. Once, a cooperative member, Wang Wenyuan, invested sixteen dou of seeds, but the slip mistakenly recorded eleven dou; another time, a cooperative member, Guo Lian, received twenty dou of naked oats, but the slip mistakenly recorded eighteen dou; the above were the only two errors, and both were corrected after verification on the same day or the next day. Not only are the accounts so clear, but all expenses are also very frugal, so production costs have decreased year by year. This area is known as a place with low yields and high costs, where "a good year yields half, and a bad year loses half." In the past, production investment generally accounted for about 40% of the total output; but last year, it decreased to 24%. Furthermore, they are also models of both work and labor reaping bumper harvests, and for five years, they have not taken a single subsidized work point from the cooperative.

      Great Unselfishness and High Style

   How did they manage to keep clear accounts and proper procedures for five years? Great unselfishness is a fundamental reason. Serving the collective cause wholeheartedly, they regard collective interests as higher than their own lives. Over the years, countless amounts of money, grain, and materials have flowed in and out of their hands, but they have never touched a needle, a thread, a blade of grass, or a piece of wood. They are truly incorruptible and clean. The cooperative (team) often chops grass in old Jia's yard, and old Jia always gathers up the leftover random grass and scraps and sends them back to the cooperative.

    Some time ago, the canteen was making vermicelli. One of the cooks muttered while pressing: "We often cook vermicelli for everyone, but we're full of the smell after we're done, and we can never eat it deliciously. Today, let's five cooks each take a piece of vermicelli home to eat!" Old Jia's wife is also a cook, so she took a piece of vermicelli home. Even though a piece of vermicelli is only worth five cents, for old Jia, who has never touched a single piece of firewood from the cooperative in five years, this was a big deal. Because of this incident, old Jia was so angry that he didn't enjoy his meals for three days and severely criticized his wife. And the day after the incident, he went to the commune to make a self-criticism (the piece of vermicelli was immediately returned after old Jia discovered it). Old Jia said well: "If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked; if the body is not straight, the shadow will be slanted. If the masses elect you as a cadre, you have to set an example for everyone."

    Not only are they so self-respecting, but even, for more than five years, they have never had a case of moving money or borrowing funds. In the autumn of 1957, old Zhao had to go to Youyu City to attend a distribution meeting. It was quite cold at that time, and old Zhao didn't have a cotton-padded coat. Other management committee members advised him to withdraw some money to sew a cotton-padded coat. But old Zhao resolutely refused. He said:

  "It's not just me who needs to sew a cotton-padded coat. If I withdraw it early, will the cooperative members withdraw it? If we open up expenses like this, there's no way we can uphold our cooperative's distribution system." As a result, he borrowed a cotton-padded coat to go to the city for the meeting.

    Under the influence of the director and accountant, in this cooperative (team), there is fundamentally no phenomenon of taking, using, moving, or borrowing things at will, and there are also very few overspending households or debtor households. Therefore, however much is on the books, that's how much can be taken out, and however much cash is on the books, that's how much can be taken out.

    Careful Calculation and Tight "Control"

    How did they manage to keep expenses low and costs down? The most important thing is to adhere to the principle of thrift. Old Jia, who worked as a long-term laborer for twenty-four years, and old Zhao, who was a peasant for most of his life, know very well that every needle and thread in the cooperative is earned by the sweat of the cooperative members. Therefore, even if they have to spend a penny, they have to ask their mouths and their hearts, and calculate several times: can things be done without spending money? Can things be done well by spending less money? Can the greatest benefit be exchanged for the smallest capital? For five years, they have consistently adhered to the "five no-expenses": that is, no expenses for things that have little to do with production relations, no expenses for things that are not urgently needed, no expenses for things that are not worth the cost, no expenses for things that can be replaced with old or used waste, and no expenses for things that need to be spent but the cooperative's economic strength cannot reach.

    In the spring – plowing the land requires buying whips, and old Jia replied: Find some tree bark and weave it yourself, and I'll give you some work points. Plowing the land also requires buying muzzle, and old Jia replied again: Dig up some grass roots and weave it yourself, and I'll also give you some work points. In the autumn – threshing requires buying flails, and old Jia brought a large pile of broken flails and mobilized everyone to use them by piecing three together or two together. In the winter – the canteen wanted to buy a stove, and after they two calculated it would cost more than two hundred yuan, so they let everyone decide. At this time, cooperative member Wang Rui offered the idea of using a broken crock mud stove, and as a result, they didn't spend a penny and spent the winter warmly. After the collectivization of production and the collectivization of life, the thing that people are most worried about is the increase in non-productive management expenses. But the management fee of this cooperative (team) only cost one hundred and sixty-five yuan in five years, an average of thirty-three yuan per year. Old Zhao stipulated for himself: use three pen nibs in a year, use a penholder for three years, and don't buy a lamp for lighting, use an ink bottle.

    Controlling expenses so tightly sometimes inevitably provokes anger. Guo Lian was so angry that he said: "Alas! Look at our plowing, don't even mention it! The grass root muzzles worn by the cattle, the elm bark whips held by the people, it's really a poor embryo and a hard frame." Because of this, they often explained to the cooperative members. In fact, even without explaining, the cooperative members would understand. The cooperative members said: "With old Jia and old Zhao in charge, it will always be a slow but steady stream, and the source of wealth will be endless, so don't worry about having shortfalls."

      Diligent Study and Asking Questions to Master Business

    Perhaps people think that old Jia and old Zhao, who have kept clear accounts, proper procedures, low expenses, and low costs for five years, must be literate and able to calculate. However, the fact is not so. In the first year of the elementary cooperative, old Jia was still an illiterate, and even old Zhao, who was known as a "sage" in the village, had only studied for one year, and even wrote the word "investment" as "head branch". Therefore, how to record what the cooperative members invested? How to record what the cooperative bought? How to record the breeding of small livestock? How to record broken farm tools and dead cattle? How to record the increased value of small mules and horses that have grown up as public property...? This really worried them to the point of forgetting meals and sleep. However, whenever they encountered these problems, they would run to neighboring villages to ask other directors and accountants for advice, or discuss them with everyone at the accounting guidance meeting.

    Being an accountant who couldn't use an abacus or calculate accounts once troubled old Zhao very much. In order to learn to use the abacus, he went to a teacher in Dishuiyan Village, eight li away. Every time he went to Dishuiyan, he would set off at sunset the day before and return to the village at the fifth watch the next day, without delaying his daytime business. The first time he went to Dishuiyan, old Jia accompanied him. On the dark and foggy sixteen-li night journey, old Jia, as a Communist Party member, gave old Zhao a lot of encouragement: "Don't look at the account books as paper, but they are related to the production of more than two thousand mu of land and the lives of one hundred and seventy people in our entire cooperative. A difference of one foreign code will mess up everything. The cooperative members handed over all their belongings to the cooperative. If we can't even figure out the accounts, how can we be worthy of the Party and the old and young in the whole village! No matter what, you have to learn to use the abacus." Old Zhao also thought of resigning several times because he was too incompetent, but with old Jia's help, he finally mustered the courage to persevere in his work.

    Other accountants do one account at a time, but old Zhao knew he couldn't do it, so every account had to go through three hands. The first hand writes a slip, the second hand copies it into a notebook, and then after it has been corrected without errors, he passes it to the third hand - copying it into the account. Therefore, although the handwriting is quite ugly, there are very few erasures in the account, and whenever you open the account book, it is clear.

      Financial Dealings Keep Credit

      "The state has state laws, and the family has family rules." In order to ensure clear accounts, proper procedures, low expenses, and low costs, old Jia and old Zhao attached great importance to the financial system. Under their leading influence, the Qigan cooperative (team) has strictly adhered to the cash management system, the warehouse management system, the expense approval system, the financial inspection system, and the same-day accounts completed on the same day, with the accountant, cashier, and custodian mutually restricting and supervising each other. In order to adhere to the system of completing the same-day accounts on the same day, old Zhao often went back to Sunjiabao to sleep in the dead of night, while old Jia almost every night sent old Zhao to the sand ditch in the middle of the two villages, and then one went west and the other went east. Sometimes old Zhao was too busy to go back to the village for meals, and old Jia would cook a few hot yams from his own home for old Zhao.

    In the financial dealings between the cooperative and the cooperative members, old Jia and old Zhao also used exchange contracts to ensure that the cooperative members and the cooperative were never separated and were twisted together. The so-called exchange contract is that for all fertilizers, funds, livestock, seeds, farm tools, and various utensils that the cooperative members invest in the cooperative, whether it is a loan, a lease, or a purchase, it is said to be a loan, it is said to be a lease, and it is said to be a purchase; borrowed items are all given IOUs, and purchased items are priced fairly; and it is said that they will be returned at what time, and they will never be delayed or accumulated for no reason. In this way, everyone has a number in their hearts, which is convenient for mutual supervision. There are also times when accidents happen and money cannot be taken out when the time comes. The livestock rent in 1955 (at that time, the cooperative adopted the form of renting cooperative members' livestock) encountered this problem. That year, the cooperative suffered a hailstorm and couldn't afford to pay. What to do? Old Jia and old Zhao invited the twelve livestock-raising households to discuss matters together. After everyone discussed, they said, whose cooperative is it? Isn't it ours? As a result, out of the two hundred and forty yuan livestock rent, sixty-six yuan was requested first that year.

    Precisely because the cooperative (team) is so consistent in what it says and does, the cooperative members compare the cooperative (team) to a "safe without locks". When they first joined the cooperative, some people were afraid that the cooperative was unreliable and often wanted to find an excuse to get the money early, and even wanted to overspend, which resulted in the cooperative cadres being exhausted in coping and very passive. However, the facts of the past five years have educated people. Now, the money that the cooperative members don't need at the moment is often automatically deposited in the cooperative.

      Strive for More Supervision from the Masses

    Who should supervise and implement the financial system? It depends on all the cooperative members. How do the cooperative members supervise and implement? First of all, they must understand the family assets. Old Jia and old Zhao have adhered to the financial disclosure system for five years as if it was a day: they disclose piecemeal exchanges every half month; they disclose the total income and expenditure situation once a month; and they disclose one game at a time during the autumn harvest distribution; and they disclose the total annual account after the entire distribution is completed. At first, the disclosure was by posting a list, but the cooperative members were illiterate, which was the same as not posting it. Later, they used occasions such as the ground, the meal field, and before and after meetings to verbally disclose to the cooperative members. When verbally disclosing, the cooperative members could not understand new terms such as inventory in kind and fixed assets, so they changed all these terms to "local language". In short, whatever the cooperative members don't know, they say what they say, and whatever the cooperative members want to know, they say what they say. The cooperative members are very concerned about their own accounts, so old Zhao often carries the household slips with him, answering the cooperative members' questions as they come and explaining everything clearly. Now, although old Jia and old Zhao have both served as cadres in the management district, they still carry forward this excellent tradition, often carrying the account slips to visit various villages, listening to the opinions of the masses, and accepting the supervision of the masses.

      Double Harvest in Work and Labor

    In order to reduce the non-productive labor in the cooperative (team), old Jia and old Zhao have never asked for subsidized work points, and like ordinary cooperative members, they rely entirely on their own labor income. Both of them are well-known diligent people in the village, and for five years, they have consistently adhered to the principle of "big work in heavy rain, small work early and late, small rain as good weather, and he is not idle when people are idle". There are many miscellaneous things in the spring, and it is inevitable to delay a few workdays; but once summer comes, and things are relatively simple, their labor days rise rapidly. In addition, old Jia also feeds eighteen sheep and two large livestock for the cooperative (team), and even when working in the village office, he can also do some business. Old Jia also has a good trick, which is to be able to give play to the enthusiasm of the production team. Whenever a small work plan is made by using a rainy day or a night, he lets go and lets the team do it, and he concentrates on going down to the team to work. As for modifying the plan, modifying the quota, the quality of work, and technological reform, they are all solved while participating in labor, using the time on the ground, in the field, on the way back and forth, or when meeting in the evening. Therefore, although they two serve as the main cadres in the cooperative (team), they do not work fewer labor days than ordinary cooperative members. Last year, out of the forty-three male full labor force in the entire cooperative (team), only six people worked more than two hundred labor days, including the two of them.

                  ＊　＊　＊

    The accounts in the cooperative are as clear as water, and the cooperative members' enthusiasm soars to the sky. The Qigan cooperative (team) has made great leaps forward year after year in just five years. By 1958, the total grain output of the entire cooperative (team) had increased more than four times compared with the elementary cooperative in 1954, the number of large livestock had increased more than double, the number of sheep had increased more than five times, and the number of pigs had increased from one to ninety-seven. Last year, the public accumulation was retained more, but the average net income per person in the entire cooperative (team) still reached more than ninety yuan (including household sideline occupations), which is equivalent to three times that of 1954.

    “放心主任”和“保险会计”
    姚文锦
    山西左云县威远堡人民公社南八里管理区党支部书记贾林茂和会计赵国富，从担任原来旗杆农业社（现在是南八里管理区的一个生产队）的主任和会计起，五年来共同管理公共财务，做到了账目清手续清，开支省成本低，群众满意地称他们为“放心主任”、“保险会计”。
    这两个人今年都五十岁了，生在同年同月；一个家住旗杆村，一个家住孙家堡；一个扛过二十多年长工，一个当了多半辈子庄户；一个是共产党员，一个是非党积极分子。1954年春，当相距一里的旗杆村和孙家堡联合办农业社的时候（现在这两个村的四十三户农民已搬到一起居住），他们俩同时被选为主任、会计。从此，共同的理想，共同的战斗，把他两个紧紧结合到一起。从1954年建成初级社以后，到1958年转为人民公社，整整五年了，旗杆社（队）的财务账目在他两个的经管下，从未发生过一次差错，和国家和社员的手续往来，也从未马虎过一次。有一回，社员王文远投资了十六斗种籽，单子上错记为十一斗；又一回，社员郭连分回了二十斗莜麦，单子上错记为十八斗；以上是仅有的两次差错，也都在当日和次日对证以后得到纠正。不光是账目这样清楚，一切开支也都很节省，所以，生产成本逐年下降。这一带是有名的“好年景收一半，赖年景丢一半”的产量低、成本高的地方，过去的生产投资一般都占总产量的40％左右；但是去年，即下降为24％。还不只这些，他俩同时还是工作、劳动双丰收的模范，五年来，没有要过社里的一个补贴工分。
      大公无私风格高
   他们怎样做到了五年来账目清、往来手续清？大公无私是个根本原因。忠心耿耿为集体事业服务，他俩把集体利益看得高于自己的生命。这些年不知有多少钱粮物资，从手里流进流出，但从来没动过一针一线、一草一木，真正是两袖清风、一身干净。社（队）里经常在老贾的院子铡草，剩下的一些乱草碎圪节，老贾也总要收拾起来，送回社里。
    前些时，食堂压粉条。有一个炊事员边压边念叨：“咱们常给大伙烩粉吃，可咱们作完了也闻饱了，永不能香香的吃一回。今天咱五个作饭的，每人拿上一个粉垞回家吃吃吧！”老贾的爱人也是个炊事员，也就拿回一个粉垞子。尽管一个粉垞子才值五分钱，可是对于五年来连社里一根柴草棍子也没有动过的老贾来说，这可是件大事。就为这件事，气得老贾三天吃饭不香，狠狠的批评了他爱人。并在发生事件的次日，就到公社作了检讨（粉垞子也在老贾发现后立即退了回去）。老贾说得好：“上梁不正下梁歪，身子不正影儿斜，群众选你当干部，就得给大伙作个样子。”
    他俩不但是这样的洁身自爱，甚至，五年多来连个挪钱借款的事也没有过。1957年秋，老赵要进右玉城开分配会议。那时天气挺凉了，老赵还没有棉衣。别的管理委员们劝他支上几个钱缝件棉衣。可是老赵坚决不干。他说：
  “要缝棉衣的不光我一人，我要早支，社员们支不支？这样乱开支，咱社的分配制度就没办法坚持了。”结果，借了个棉袄进城开会。
    在主任和会计的影响下，在这个社（队）里，根本看不到乱拿乱用、乱挪乱借的现象，也很少有超支户、欠款户，因此，账上有多少东西就能往出拿多少东西，账上有多少现金就能往出拿多少现金。
    精打细算“卡”得紧
    他们又怎样做到了开支省、成本低？最主要的是坚持节俭原则。扛过二十四年长工的老贾和当了多半辈子庄户的老赵，很懂得社里的一针一线都是社员用汗水换来的，因此，那怕花一个大子儿，也要口问心、心问口的盘算几次：不花钱能不能办了事？少花钱能不能办好事？能不能用最小的本钱换来最大的利益？五年来他们一贯坚持了“五不开支”：即对生产关系不大的不开支，不是迫切需要的不开支，得不偿失的不开支，能以旧代新、利用废物的不开支，需要花而社里的经济力量达不到的不开支。
    春天——耕地的要买鞭子，老贾就答复：找点树皮自己编去吧，给你记上点工。耕地的又要买笼嘴，老贾又答复：刨点草根自己挽去吧，也给你记点工。秋天——打场的要买槤枷，老贾就抱来一大堆烂槤枷，动员大家三拼二、二拼一地对付着用。冬天——食堂要买火炉，他两个一划算得二百多元，就让大家拿主意。这时，社员王瑞就献计用破缸泥火炉，结果没花一个钱，暖暖和和地过了冬。生产集体化和生活集体化以后，人们最担心的是怕增加非生产性的管理费用。可是这个社（队）的管理费，五年才花了一百六十五元，每年平均三十三元。老赵给自己规定：三个笔尖用一年，一个笔杆用三年，点灯不买灯，用的是墨水瓶。
    开支卡得这么紧，有时也免不了惹人生气。郭连就气得说过：“唉！看咱这个耕地的，算别提啦！牛头带的草根笼嘴，人手拿的榆皮鞭子，真是一个穷胎子、苦架子。”为这，他俩常向社员解释。其实，不解释，社员也会明白的。社员们说：“有老贾老赵当家，永远是细水长流，财源不断，你就别愁有个马高蹬短。”
      勤学勤问钻业务
    也许人们以为作到五年账目清、往来手续清、开支省、成本低的老贾老赵，一定是能写会算的人物。可是，事实不是这样。刚搞初级社的那年，老贾还是个大字不识的文盲，就连在村里被称为“圣人”的老赵也只念过一年书，连个“投资”二字都写成了“头支”。因此，社员投进的东西怎么记？社里买进的东西怎么记？繁殖下小牲畜怎么记？农具坏了、牛死了怎么记？作为公共财产的小骡马长大后价值提高了又该怎么记……？这真把他俩愁得废寝忘餐。但是，一遇到这些问题，他俩就跑到邻村向别的主任、会计们请教，或在会计辅导会议上请大伙讨论。
    当会计打不来算盘算不来账，曾经使老赵苦恼得很。为了学打算盘，他到八里远的滴水沿村找了个老师。每次去滴水沿的时候，都是头天日落动身，次日五更回村，还不误白天的营生。头次去滴水沿的时候，是老贾陪着去的，在黑压压雾沉沉的十六里夜行途中，身为共产党员的老贾对老赵进行了许多鼓励：“别看账本是纸的，可它关系着咱全社两千多亩土地的生产和一百七十口人的生活。差下一个洋码码，就会乱个一锅粥。社员把他们的全部家当交给社，咱们要是连个账也弄不清，怎能对得起党，对得起全村老少！说啥你也得把打算盘学会。”老赵也曾因自己能力太差，几次想到辞职，但在老贾的帮助下，终于鼓起勇气，坚持了工作。
    别的会计是一笔账一道手，老赵知道自己不行，每笔账都要经过三道手。头道手记个单子，二道手腾在本子上，然后经过校正无误了，他才过第三道手——往账上抄。所以，别看字儿写得挺丑，可账上很少有涂改现象，什么时候翻开账本，也是清清楚楚的。
      财务往来守信用
      “国有国法，家有家规”，为了保证账目清、往来清、开支省、成本低，老贾老赵对于财务制度十分重视。在他两个的带头影响下，旗杆社（队）五年如一日地严格坚持了现金管理制度、仓库保管制度、开支批准制度、财务检查制度，以及当日的账当日了，会计、出纳、保管互相制约、互相监督等制度。为了坚持当日的账当日了的制度，老赵经常是更深夜半才回孙家堡睡觉，而老贾则差不多每夜都把老赵送到两村中间的沙沟，然后一个向西，一个向东。有时老赵忙得顾不上回村吃饭，老贾就从自己的家里给老赵烧几个热腾腾的山药。
    在社和社员的财务往来上，老贾老赵还通过往来合同，使社员和社永无隔阂，拧到了一气。所谓往来合同，就是凡社员向社投进的肥料、资金、牲畜、种籽、农具和各种用具等，说借就是借，说租就是租，说买就是买；借的都打借条，买的作价公道；而且是说几时还就几时还，决不无故拖拉积欠。这样，大家心里都有数，便于互相监督。也有时候发生意外，到时候拿不出钱来。1955年的牲畜租金（那时对社员的牲畜采取租用形式）就碰到这个问题。那年社里遭了雹灾，付不起，怎么办？老贾老赵就把十二家养畜户请到一起，商量着办事。大家一商量，说社是谁的，还不是咱的？结果，二百四十多元牲畜租金，当年先要了六十六元。
    正因为社（队）里是这样的说一不二，所以社员把社（队）比之为“没有锁子的保险柜”。刚入社时，也有人怕社靠不住，常想找点借口，把钱早拿到手，甚至还要超支，结果使社干部穷于应付，十分被动。但是，五年来的事实教育了人们。现在，社员眼下不用的钱，常常自动存到社里。
      争取群众多监督
    财务制度靠谁来监督和执行？靠全体社员。社员如何去监督和执行？首先得了解家底。老贾老赵五年如一日地坚持了财务公开制度：每半月公布一次零星往来；每一月公布一次收、支总情况；秋收分配时是分一场公布一场；全分完了公布全年的总账。起初公布时是贴个单子，但是，社员不识字，跟没贴一样。以后，他俩就利用地头、饭场、会前会后等场合，向社员口头公布。口头公布时，社员又听不懂什么库存实物呀、固定资产呀等新名词，他俩又把这些名词一律改为“土话”。总之是社员不知什么说什么，社员想知什么说什么。社员对有关自己的账目挺关心，老赵就把分户单子经常随身带，社员随问随答，交代得一清二楚。现在，老贾老赵虽然都担任了管理区的干部，仍然发扬了这个优良传统，经常带上账单子到各村去转，听取群众意见，接受群众监督。
      工作劳动双丰收
    为了减少社（队）里的非生产用工，老贾老赵从来没有要过补贴工分，和一个普通社员一样，完全依靠自己的劳动收入。他俩都是村里有名的勤谨人，五年来一贯坚持了“大雨大办公，早晚小办公，小雨当好天，人闲他不闲”。春天事情杂，多误几个工是免不了的；但一到夏天，事情比较单纯了，他俩的劳动日数便飞快上升。另外，老贾还给社（队）喂着十八只羊和两头大牲畜，即便在村办公，也能捎带着作点营生。老贾还有一份拿手戏，就是能够发挥生产小队的积极性。每当利用一个雨天或一个晚上作了小段作业计划之后，便放开手让小队搞，自己安心下队劳动。至于修改计划、修改定额、活计质量、技术改革等，都在参加劳动中，利用地头、场畔、来回走路或晚上碰头的时候就解决了。因此，他两个虽然担任着社（队）里的主要干部，作的劳动日并不比一般社员少。去年，全社（队）四十三个男整劳力，作到二百个劳动日以上的只有六人，其中就有他两个。
                  ＊　＊　＊
    社里账清如水，社员干劲冲天。旗杆社（队）在短短的五年中，连年大跃进。到1958年，全社（队）粮食总产量比初级合作社的1954年增加了四倍以上，大牲畜增加了一倍以上，羊增加了五倍以上，猪由一口增加为九十七口。去年的公共积累扣留较多，但全社（队）每口人的平均纯收入仍达九十余元（包括家庭副业），相当于1954年的三倍。
