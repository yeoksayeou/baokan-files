Summer Goods Arrive Seasonably

    Liuyang Summer Cloth
    The famous Liuyang summer cloth has seen a significant increase in production this year, with improvements in quality as well. By June 15th, over seven thousand bolts had been produced.
    The main production areas for Liuyang County's summer cloth are in the Gao Ping, Shegang, and Tangjiayuan communes, with Gao Ping Commune having the largest output. Gao Ping Commune has organized all 295 handicraft workers producing summer cloth in the commune into specialized teams to develop summer cloth production.

    Bao Luan Bamboo Mats
    The Fengdu County Arts and Crafts Cooperative in Sichuan is producing large quantities of the nationally renowned handicraft – Bao Luan bamboo mats. These are woven from cold bamboo, which has endured wind and frost on high mountains and is flexible yet not brittle.
    These bamboo mats weigh only one-sixth of ordinary bamboo mats and can be folded and stored like cotton cloth, making them very easy to carry. Artisans weave and paint designs with national characteristics, such as Chang'e flying to the moon and fairies scattering flowers, as well as scenes reflecting the harvest and the Great Leap Forward, on these mats.
    Bao Luan bamboo mats are essential household items for the summer and also decorations that beautify bedrooms.

    Cold Fragrance Prickly Heat Powder
    The Tianjin Wuzhou Daily Chemical Factory is rushing to produce a type of Cold Fragrance Prickly Heat Powder.
    Cold Fragrance Prickly Heat Powder has a fragrant aroma and possesses the efficacy of cooling, anti-inflammatory, relieving itching, and astringing the skin. Apply two or three times a day on prickly heat rashes for noticeable improvement.

　　Beautiful and Durable Paper Fans
    The handicraft departments in both urban and rural areas of Yueyang County, Hunan Province, are vigorously increasing the production of paper fans, with over 200,000 already on the market.
    This year, the paper fans produced in Yueyang are both beautiful and durable, with an increase in variety. For example, fan bones come in both black and white bamboo; fan surfaces are available in black oiled paper, white inlaid gold flower paper, or inlaid silver flower paper, as well as colored versions. The fan surfaces are painted with traditional Chinese paintings, colored paintings, scenes reflecting modern life, and ancient stories and figures.

    Exquisite Women's Gloves
    The embroidery counter of the Shanghai Arts and Crafts Service Department has added over twenty new styles of summer women's gloves, available in white, coffee, natural colors, and more. These gloves are all made of cotton thread and are crocheted with various beautiful patterns, making them very delicate.

    Plastic Sweat-Absorbing Undershirt
    The Shanghai No. 2 Plastics Factory has successfully trial-produced a plastic sweat-absorbing undershirt. Actors can wear it in the summer to prevent their costumes from sticking to their bodies. This sweat-absorbing undershirt is also suitable for steelworkers and other workers operating in high-temperature environments.
