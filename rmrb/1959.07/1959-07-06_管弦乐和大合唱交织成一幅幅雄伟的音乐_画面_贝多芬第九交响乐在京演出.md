Xinhua News Agency, July 5th—The Central Philharmonic Orchestra, the Central Broadcasting Orchestra, and the Central Philharmonic Choir jointly performed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (the Choral Symphony), a peak of European classical symphony, in Beijing today. This is the first performance of this immortal work in China, 135 years after its creation.

The "Ninth Symphony" is the last symphony written by Beethoven, and it centrally reflects the worldview of this artistic master. With highly skilled techniques, it is recognized as the summation of Beethoven's creative life. The first three movements of this symphony describe the process of "through struggle, towards victory; through pain, towards joy." Conductor Yan Liangkun and the symphony orchestra meticulously portrayed the complex musical images of struggling for freedom and joy in the first three movements: severe and firm will; tragic conflict; unease and depression; and the lyrical longing for happiness, etc. Afterwards, a series of bugle calls brought the audience into a new realm—the fourth movement, praising the unity and friendship of the people. Beethoven chose the "Ode to Joy" by the great German poet Schiller as the choral lyrics for this movement, and for the first time, incorporated human voices into the symphony. The cellos and double basses deeply and slowly "narrated" the moving theme of joy, followed by a heroic march and a triumphant "battle" with unstoppable momentum. On this basis, the choir and symphony orchestra jointly "sang" the voices of Beethoven and the broad masses of the people: "Millions of people unite, loving and caring for each other." The genius composer, in order to express joy through unity, further blended the theme of unity with the theme of joy, bringing the symphony to a climax. The tutti of the entire orchestra, the grand chorus, and the emotional male and female quartets harmoniously interwove into magnificent musical "pictures," like surging waves, rushing and surging. The sound of "Millions of people—forever united as brothers" and the frenetic and rapid finale left the entire audience in an atmosphere of unparalleled jubilation. Lü Ji, chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, pointed out that this performance marks that Chinese musicians have not only done a lot of work in inheriting and carrying forward the tradition of national music, but also earnestly studied and absorbed the essence of foreign music.

    管弦乐和大合唱交织成一幅幅雄伟的音乐“画面”
    贝多芬第九交响乐在京演出
    据新华社5日讯　中央乐团交响乐队、中央广播乐团和中央乐团合唱队今天在北京联合演出了代表欧洲古典交响乐高峰的“贝多芬第九交响乐”（即合唱交响乐）。这是这部不朽的作品诞生一百三十五年以来第一次在中国演出。
      “第九交响乐”是贝多芬所写的最后一部交响乐，它集中地反映了这位艺术大师的世界观，具有高度纯熟的技巧，被公认为是贝多芬创作生活的总结。这部交响乐的前三个乐章描写了“通过斗争，走向胜利；通过痛苦，走向欢乐”的过程。指挥严良坤和交响乐队在前三章里细致地刻划出为了自由和欢乐而斗争的复杂的音乐形象：严竣而坚定的意志；悲壮的冲突；不安和消沉；以及对于幸福的抒情的向往等等。随后，一阵阵号角声把听众带进了一个新的境界——歌颂人民团结友爱的第四乐章。贝多芬选择德国伟大诗人席勒的“欢乐颂”做为这一章的合唱歌词，并且第一次把人的声音运用到交响乐中来。大提琴和低音提琴深沉、低缓地“倾述”出动人的欢乐主题，接着是一段英雄式的进行曲和一场势如破竹的胜利的“战斗”，就在这个基础上，合唱队和交响乐队共同“唱”出了贝多芬和广大人民的心声：“亿万人民团结起来，大家相爱又相亲”。天才的作曲家为了表现出团结中取得欢乐，进而把团结的主题和欢乐的主题揉合在一起，使交响乐出现了高潮。全部管弦乐队的齐奏、大合唱和富于感情的男女四重唱和谐地交织出一幅幅雄伟的音乐
  “画面”，好似波涛汹涌，奔腾澎湃。“亿万人民——永远团结成兄弟”的声音和狂热快速的终曲使全场听众处在无比欢腾的气氛中。中国音乐家协会主席吕骥指出，这次演出标志着：我国音乐工作者不仅在继承和发扬民族音乐传统方面做了许多工作；同时也认真地学习和吸收了外国音乐的精华。（附图片）
