    (Reported by our newspaper) The Party branch of the First Production Team of the Shanhe Brigade of the Changhe People's Commune in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, is a branch that knows how to follow the mass line. Their work involves listening both to the Party and to the masses. Therefore, their leadership over production is very strong, and the early rice is planted extensively and grows well.
    How to implement the instructions from higher authorities by proceeding from reality? This branch has always been troubled by this. They believed that they could only listen to one side, either the superiors or the masses, and that it would be difficult to handle things if they listened to both.
    After the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was published, the branch organized all Party members to study the parts related to the mass line. Based on improving understanding, they summarized the experiences and lessons of the Great Leap Forward last year. This made everyone realize that work cannot be done well without following the mass line.
    However, in specific implementation, some Party members were still worried that if they listened to the opinions of the masses, the regulations of the higher authorities could not be implemented. It was only in later practice that this idea was corrected. For the first batch of early rice transplanting, the commune Party committee and the brigade general branch required completion by April 25th. At that time, some Party members, learning from past experiences and lessons, advocated handing over the time stipulated by the higher authorities to the masses for discussion, but some Party members believed that the regulations of the higher authorities should be followed directly; some even said that if the opinions of the masses were listened to, the tasks stipulated by the higher authorities would not be completed even by December. Based on this situation, the branch again discussed "How to follow the mass line" within the Party. It was further recognized that the most important thing for doing good work is to consult with the masses when handling affairs. After unifying thoughts within the Party, the time for early rice transplanting was boldly handed over to the masses for discussion. When the masses started discussing, some people suspected that the branch was "genuinely intending to ask, falsely consulting," fearing criticism if they raised different opinions. At this time, the branch expressed its attitude to the commune members: ensuring that they would listen to the opinions of the masses with an open mind. They also summarized the experience of Chen Changsheng and other two production teams who had planted early (around April 10th) thirteen mu of early rice last year with an average yield of over a thousand jin per mu. The facts showed the masses the benefits of planting early rice, and the masses were very convinced after hearing this. At the same time, the branch also held forums for experienced farmers and technicians to solicit their opinions. After discussions and forums, everyone presented many facts and unanimously believed that advancing the transplanting of early rice this year was in line with the actual situation. Thanks to the mobilization of the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, the early rice transplanting task of the entire team was completed ahead of schedule on April 22nd.
    When harvesting spring rapeseed, the higher authorities instructed to complete it by May 5th. The branch immediately organized commune members to discuss it. The commune members suggested that the spring rapeseed had not yet matured and could not be harvested before the 5th. Postponing it to the 15th would be appropriate. The branch reported the opinions of the commune members to the general branch, and the general branch agreed with this opinion. As a result, the rapeseed and broad beans were mature when they were harvested. The commune members were very satisfied and said: "The Party members listened to us, and the spring rapeseed was not lost." Another example is the issue of contracted production. In the past, a few Party member cadres closed the door and set targets, so it took more than half a year, and the targets changed six or seven times, and the masses did not accept it. This time, the branch clarified that "we must listen to the Party and listen to the masses," and boldly handed over the contracted production targets to the masses for full discussion. The commune members said: "The targets are set by ourselves, so we must work hard to achieve them."

### 既听党的话　又听群众的话  山河大队第一生产队党支部坚持群众路线

    既听党的话　又听群众的话
    山河大队第一生产队党支部坚持群众路线
    本报讯　浙江萧山县长河人民公社山河大队第一生产队党支部是一个会走群众路线的支部。他们做工作是既听党的话，又听群众的话。因此，他们对生产的领导就很坚强，早稻种的多长的又好。
    执行上级指示如何从实际出发。这个支部过去一直很苦恼。他们认为上级的和群众的话，两头只能听一头，若是两头的话都听，事情就难办。
    党的八届六中全会决议公布以后，支部组织全体党员学习了有关群众路线的部分。在提高认识的基础上，总结了去年大跃进的经验和教训。使大家认识到：不走群众路线，工作是做不好的。
    但在具体执行中，有些党员还担心听群众的意见，上级的规定就不能贯彻。在以后的实践中，才纠正了这种想法，第一批早稻插秧，公社党委和大队总支，要求在4月25日完成。当时有一部分党员，接受过去的经验教训，主张把上级的规定时间交给群众讨论，但也有一部分党员，认为上级的规定照做就是；有的甚至说，听群众的意见，上级规定的任务到12月也完不成。支部根据这一情况，又在党内讨论了“怎样走群众路线的问题”。进一步认识到作好工作最重要的就是办事同群众商量。党内思想统一后，就把早稻插秧的时间交群众讨论。群众在开始讨论时，有些人怀疑支部是“真主意，假商量”，怕提了不同意见吃批评。这时支部就向社员表明态度：保证虚心听取群众意见。并总结了陈长生等两个生产小队去年早插（4月10日左右）十三亩早稻平均亩产千斤以上的经验。以事实向群众说明早稻早插的好处，群众听了十分信服。同时，支部又召开了老农、技术员座谈会，征求他们的意见。经过讨论和座谈，大家摆出了许多事实，一致认为今年早稻提早插秧，符合实际情况。由于发挥了群众的积极性和创造性，全队早稻插秧任务，提前在4月22日完成。
    收割春花的时候，上级布置要在5月5日完成。支部就马上组织社员讨论。社员们提出，现在春花还没有成熟，5日以前不能收割。推迟到15日收割合适，支部把社员的意见反映到总支，总支同意了这个意见。结果油菜、蚕豆收割时都成熟了。社员很满意地说：“党员听我们的话，春花没损失。”又如包产问题，过去是几个党员干部关门订指标，因此时间费了半年多，指标变动了六、七次，群众也没有接受。这次支部明确了“既要听党的话又要听群众的话”，就将包产指标大胆交给群众充分讨论。社员说：“指标是自己订出来的，一定出力干。”
