    Friendship
    In Building No. 3 of the Xijiao (West Suburb) Guesthouse in Beijing, there lived a guest from Sichuan who had come to attend a meeting.

    This guest was named Zhan Ziwen, and he was the Party Branch Secretary of the Zhonghe Township in Lezhi County, Sichuan Province. Shortly after arriving at the Xijiao Guesthouse, a lump grew on his right leg. It was red, swollen, and so painful that he couldn't walk. The service personnel of Building No. 3, Yang Jicheng and Wu Zhaoyun, and others, took care of him meticulously. At mealtimes, they would fetch his meals for him, and specially selected rice and spicy dishes for him. When Zhan Ziwen went to the hospital to treat his leg, service personnel Zhao Bingji and Wu Zhaoyun carried him from upstairs to downstairs, then onto the car, and accompanied him to the hospital for treatment. After returning, service person Tian Ye applied hot compresses to his wound every five minutes. When Zhan Ziwen was hospitalized, they sent people to deliver the meeting documents to him in a timely manner every day. When he was discharged, they picked him up again.

    From then on, a deep friendship was established between Zhan Ziwen and the service personnel. Beijing Zhang Yi (with picture)

    友谊
    在北京西郊宾馆的三号楼上，住着一位从四川来开会的客人。
    这位客人叫詹子文，是中共四川乐至县中和乡的党总支书记。到西郊宾馆来不久，右腿上就长了一个疙瘩。又红又肿，疼的不能走路。三号楼的服务员杨集成、吴兆云等同志无微不至地照顾他。到了吃饭的时候，他们就给他打饭，还特别挑选大米饭和有辣味的菜给他吃。詹子文上医院医腿，服务员赵丙吉、吴兆云就从楼上把他背到楼下，再背上汽车，陪他到医院去看病。回来后服务员田烨每隔五分钟替他在伤口上作一次热敷。詹子文住院了，他们每天派人及时地把大会文件送给他看。出院时，又把它接回来。
    从此，詹子文和服务员之间建立了深厚的友谊。　北京　张义（附图片）
