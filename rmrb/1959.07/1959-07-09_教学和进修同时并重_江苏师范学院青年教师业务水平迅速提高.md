Balancing Teaching and Further Education
Young Teachers at Jiangsu Normal College Rapidly Improve Their Professional Skills

    (Our report) Jiangsu Normal College has adopted various forms to help teachers pursue on-the-job professional development and systematically improve their skills, thereby effectively enhancing the quality of teaching.
    In recent years, the number of students at Jiangsu Normal College has increased significantly, but the proportion of teachers has not increased as much. The professional skills of the teaching staff are also uneven. Of the 283 teachers in the school, young teaching assistants account for more than 60%. Based on this situation, the Party committee of the college decided to rely on its own efforts and adopt a method that combines teaching work with professional development to improve the professional skills of teachers to meet the needs of the school's development.
    In the work of cultivating teachers, each department has made long-term plans. Based on the tasks stipulated in the teaching plan, they make overall arrangements, considering not only the current teaching tasks but also the needs two or three years later, so that each teacher is clear about their current teaching tasks and subjects for further study, as well as what courses they will teach in the future, and has a direction to work towards. For example, the Physics Department has formulated a three-year plan for the teaching work of all teachers in the department, specifically arranging the courses that each teacher will be responsible for lecturing and tutoring.
    In order to realize these plans, each department first focused on helping young teachers and adopted many methods. For example, the mathematics, physics, and other departments adopted the following five methods to train and improve young teachers: (1) Assign experienced senior teachers to be mentors for young teachers. The Physics Department adopted the method of "one leading several," incorporating the help of senior teachers to young teachers and the learning of young teachers from senior teachers into the teachers' own red and expert plans. (2) Help young teachers start teaching courses. Senior teachers help young teachers analyze teaching materials and write lesson plans. When young teachers give lectures, senior teachers and other young teachers attend. After class, a review meeting is held where everyone offers opinions to help young teachers master the content of the teaching materials and teaching methods. (3) Senior teachers take the lead in giving lectures. Young teachers attend the lectures of senior teachers, and senior teachers tell young teachers about their experiences and lessons learned in lecturing. Young teachers absorb the strengths of senior teachers and combine them with the situation of their own classes to teach students. (4) Recruit young teachers to participate in the preparation of teaching syllabuses, teaching materials, and scientific research. (5) Regularly give lectures to young teachers to help them master deeper scientific knowledge. Practice over the past six months has proven that these methods have played a significant role in improving the teaching ability of young teachers and helping them to pursue further studies. For example, young teacher Jiang Yeguang is newly teaching the second-year theoretical mechanics course this semester, and senior teachers Zhu Zhengyuan and Cai Mingzhi are specifically helping her prepare lessons. They patiently tell her everything from the content of the teaching materials to the teaching methods, and how to explain the key points of each chapter. Lecturer Han Yelong of the Thermotics Teaching and Research Group personally conducted calculation experiments for the four young teachers he was helping to prepare lessons, solving many practical difficulties. Some senior teachers also guide young teachers in their studies, giving them lectures regularly. In addition to shouldering the responsibility of training young teachers, senior teachers themselves also use their spare time to strengthen their professional studies, tirelessly striving for excellence and seeking further improvement. Senior teachers Zhang Bokang and Yang Chengqi improved themselves by compiling teaching materials and reading many reference books.
    Through the above-mentioned diverse forms of further education, the enthusiasm of all teachers in the college has been mobilized, and the expertise of each teacher has been brought into play. Those who are capable are teachers, and they teach and learn from each other, thereby greatly improving the teaching level and quality of teachers. At present, 99 of the 182 teaching assistants in the college have begun to lecture, and the general quality of their lectures is very good. Young teachers Yan Dakang and Tang Qihan have greatly improved their teaching level by co-compiling teaching materials and co-teaching courses with senior teachers. They are good at inspiring students to think independently and connect with middle school teaching materials in the classroom, and the quality of their lectures is very good, and they are generally welcomed by students. Senior teachers are also more serious in their work of preparing lessons, lecturing, and compiling teaching materials. Because teachers lecture well, students understand deeply and thoroughly. The overall teaching quality of the school has improved significantly this semester. The results of the recent college-wide examinations show that the average number of students with excellent and good grades in each department is above 75%. In the Inorganic Chemistry course of Class 1(B) of the Chemistry Department, the proportion of students with excellent and good grades in the last semester's examination was 62%, and the results of the recent examination reached 96%, eliminating the phenomenon of failure.

    教学和进修同时并重
    江苏师范学院青年教师业务水平迅速提高
    本报讯　江苏师范学院采取多种多样的形式帮助教师的在职业务进修，有计划地提高教师水平，因而有效地提高了教学质量。
    几年来江苏师范学院学生增加很多，但教师增加的比例却很小。师资的业务水平也不平衡。全校二百八十三个教师中，青年助教占60％以上。院党委根据这个情况决定自力更生，采取教学工作和业务进修相结合的方法，提高教师的业务水平，以适应学校发展的需要。
    在培养教师的工作上，各系都作了长远的计划，根据教学计划中所规定的任务，进行通盘的安排，不仅考虑到当前的教学任务，同时考虑到两三年后的需要，使每个教师都明确自己目前的教学任务和进修科目，以及将来担任什么课程，也有了努力方向。如物理系制订了全系教师教学工作的三年规划，具体安排了每个教师要担任讲授和辅导的课程。
    为了实现这些计划，各系首先以帮助青年教师为主，采取了许多办法。如数学、物理等科系采取了如下五种方法培养和提高青年教师：（一）分配有教学经验的老教师，作青年教师的指导教师。物理系采取了“一个带几个”的办法，把老教师帮助青年教师，青年教师向老教师学习列入了教师自己的红专规划。（二）帮助青年教师开课。老教师帮助青年教师分析教材、写备课笔记。青年教师上课时老教师和其他青年教师都去听课。课后开评议会，大家提出意见，帮助青年教师掌握教材内容和教学方法。（三）老教师带头上课。老教师讲课，青年教师都去听，老教师把自己讲课中的经验教训告诉青年教师。青年教师吸取老教师的长处，结合本班的情况，再给学生讲课。（四）吸收青年教师参加编写教学大纲、教材和科学研究等工作。（五）定期给青年教师上课，帮助他们掌握更深的科学知识。经过半年来的实践，证明这些办法对提高青年教师的教学能力，帮助青年教师进修都起了很大作用。如青年教师姜耶光本学期新开二年级的理论力学课，老教师朱正元、蔡铭之具体帮助她备课。从教学内容到教学方法，每章的重点如何讲都耐心告诉她。热学教研组讲师韩叶龙在帮助四个青年教师备课时，还亲自做演算实验给他们看，解决了很多实际的困难。有的老教师还指导青年教师进修，定期的给他们上课。老教师除了担负培养青年教师的责任外，他们自己也利用了业余时间，加强业务进修，孜孜不倦地精益求精，求得进一步的提高。老教师张伯康、杨承祺，通过编教材，阅读了许多参考书籍来提高自己。
    通过以上多种多样的进修形式，调动了全院所有教师的积极性，发挥了每一个教师的专长，能者为师，互教互学，因而大大的提高了教师的教学水平和教学质量。目前全院一百八十二个助教中已有九十九人开始讲课，一般上课质量很好。青年教师严大康、唐起汉和老教师在一起合编教材，合开课，教学水平有了很大提高。他们在课堂上善于启发学生独立思考和联系中学教材，上课质量很好，普遍受到学生的欢迎。老教师无论在备课、讲课以及编教材的工作上也更加认真。由于教师上课讲得好，所以学生理解深透。这学期来整个学校的教学质量有了显著提高。最近全院举行考试的结果，各系成绩优良的学生平均在75％以上，化学系一（乙）班的无机化学课，上学期考试成绩优良者占62％，最近考试结果达到了96％，消灭了不及格的现象。（朱冰菊）（附图片）
