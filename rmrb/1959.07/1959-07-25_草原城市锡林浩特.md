Xilinhot, a Grassland City
Xinhua News Agency reporter Liao Youbin

	In midsummer, the grassland city of Xilinhot is beautiful and the weather is pleasantly cool. Scaffolding erected on construction sites is dense, and factory chimneys reach straight into the blue sky. The streets are bustling, and the beautiful melody of Mongolian songs is transmitted from loudspeakers. Convoys of cars drive from here to the hinterland of the grassland. Civil aviation planes also fly here regularly. Seeing the prosperity of this city, newcomers almost forget that they are on the Xilin Gol grassland.

	Before liberation, Xilinhot was originally a settlement with only an ancient temple and hundreds of small earthen houses. Now it has developed into a new town with a population of nearly 40,000, becoming the political, economic, and cultural center of the grassland. The Xilin Gol League government is located here.

	In the past, there was no industry on the grassland. Not even an iron nail or a brick was produced. The production tools used by farmers and herdsmen were all supplied from other places. Animal products such as fur, milk, and meat, which were abundant in pastoral areas, had to be transported to Zhangjiakou and other places thousands of miles away for processing. Now, more than 20 small and medium-sized factories for power generation, copper smelting, machinery, dairy products, and leather have been established here, gradually becoming a new industrial base on the grassland. The Xilinhot Machinery Factory, newly built last year, has begun to manufacture production tools for farmers and herdsmen and also manufactures some mine cars for coal mines. The Xilinhot Coal Mine can mine tens of thousands of tons of coal every year, supplying the needs of pastoral areas. The modern Xilinhot Leather Factory, established in 1955, has produced a large number of yurts, felt, rugs, leather coats, and riding boots for herdsmen. In the past, during the peak milk production season, the fresh milk that the herdsmen could not finish was simply wasted. Since the establishment of the Xilinhot Dairy Factory, it has purchased more than 1,400 tons of milk in five years, increasing the income of herdsmen by more than 257,000 yuan. Xilinhot also has a large-scale vegetable farm that grows a large number of vegetables every year, supplying factories, institutions, and pastoral areas, so that people living on the grassland can also eat fresh vegetables. The Xilinhot mechanized farm is reclaiming wasteland, preparing to gradually enable pastoral areas to achieve self-sufficiency in grain.

	The sales departments of department stores, grain, food, and other companies, as well as restaurants, teahouses, etc., located in Xilinhot, form a commercial street that is quite prosperous for the grassland. Herdsmen from the grassland come here in droves to sell animal products and buy back satisfactory daily necessities. Commercial departments also transport a large number of means of production and means of subsistence to various parts of the grassland and purchase local specialty products that could not be sold from the herdsmen.

	The development of cultural and educational undertakings in Xilinhot is also advancing by leaps and bounds. Now, there is Xilinhot Middle School here, as well as secondary specialized schools such as animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, industry, finance, health, meteorology, and posts and telecommunications, to cultivate various professional talents for grassland construction. There are more than 2,000 students enrolled, almost all of whom are children of farmers and herdsmen. The Xilinhot Normal School and the Animal Husbandry Mechanization School, which will open this autumn, are under construction. Cultural and welfare facilities such as cinemas, theaters, Mongolian storytelling halls, and bathhouses receive herdsmen from all over the grassland every day. The herdsmen also have their own radio station and newspaper. Since its establishment, the Xilinhot People's Hospital has treated more than 124,000 people. Zhamusha, a Mongolian herdsman, suffered from hernia for more than ten years and could not work. He was cured after undergoing surgery at the hospital.

	Xilinhot is also a transportation hub on the Xilin Gol grassland. There are eleven highways from Xilinhot to all banners and counties in the league, with cars passing every day. In October last year, civil aviation flights were opened, greatly shortening the distance between this grassland city and all parts of the country. Before liberation, it took more than a month to travel from Xilinhot to Hohhot by ox cart, more than half a month on horseback, and three days by car; now it only takes one hour by plane. Telephone lines from Xilinhot to the agricultural and pastoral areas of the entire league are as dense as spider webs. The banners and counties and most of the people's communes on the grassland can now directly make long-distance calls to the capital Beijing and all parts of the country.

    草原城市锡林浩特
    新华社记者　廖由滨
    盛夏，草原城市锡林浩特风光明媚，凉爽宜人。建筑工地上搭起的脚手架密密麻麻，工厂的烟囱直插蓝天。街上熙熙攘攘，扩音器传送出蒙古歌曲的优美旋律。一列列汽车从这里开向草原腹地。民航机也定期飞到这里。看到这个城市的繁荣景象，刚到这儿的人们几乎忘记了自己是在锡林郭勒大草原上。
    锡林浩特解放前原来是一个只有一座古庙和上百间小土房的居民点，现在已经发展成一个近四万人口的新城镇，成为草原上的政治、经济和文化中心。锡林郭勒盟公署就设在这里。
    过去，草原上没有工业，连一根铁钉和一块砖瓦都不生产，农牧民用的生产工具全靠外地供给。牧区盛产的皮毛、乳、肉等畜产品，要运到千里以外的张家口等地加工。现在，这里已经建立起发电、炼铜、机械、乳品、皮革等二十多个中小型工厂，逐渐成为草原上的新兴工业基地。去年新建的锡林浩特机械厂，开始为农牧民制造生产工具，也为煤矿制造一些矿车。锡林浩特煤矿每年能开采成千上万吨的煤，供应牧区的需要。1955年建立的现代化锡林浩特皮革厂，为牧民生产了大批蒙古包毛毡、花毯子、皮大衣、马靴等生活用品。过去每逢产奶旺季，牧民们吃不完的鲜牛奶只好白白地浪费掉，自从建立了锡林浩特乳品厂，五年中收购的牛奶达一千四百多吨，给牧民增加了二十五万七千多元的收入。锡林浩特还有一处规模很大的蔬菜农场，每年种出大量蔬菜，供应工厂、机关和牧区，使居住在草原上的人们，也能够吃到新鲜的蔬菜。锡林浩特机耕农场正在开垦荒地，准备逐渐使牧区做到粮食自给。
    设立在锡林浩特的百货、粮食、食品等各公司的门市部，以及饭馆、茶馆等，组成了一条在草原来说是相当繁华的商业大街。来自草原的牧民们，熙熙攘攘地在这里出售畜产品，买回满意的生活用品。商业部门还把大批生产资料和生活资料，运送到草原各地，并从牧民手里收购过去卖不掉的土特产品。
    锡林浩特文化教育事业的发展也是一日千里。现在，这里有锡林浩特中学，还有畜牧兽医、工业、财政、卫生、气象、邮电等中等专业学校，为草原建设培养各种专业人材，入学的学生有两千多名，几乎全是农牧民的子弟。今年秋天就要开学的锡林浩特师范学校和牧业机械化学校，校舍正在紧张施工。电影院、剧场、蒙语说书馆、澡塘等文化福利场所，每天都在接待着从草原各地来的牧民。牧民们还有自己的广播电台和报纸。锡林浩特人民医院建立以来，已经治疗了十二万四千多人次。蒙古族牧民扎木沙患了十多年的疝气症，不能劳动，来到医院动手术后就治好了。
    锡林浩特还是锡林郭勒草原上的一个交通枢纽，有十一条公路从锡林浩特通往全盟各旗县，每天都有汽车通行。去年10月又有民用飞机通航，大大缩短了这个草原城市同全国各地的距离。解放前，从锡林浩特到呼和浩特，坐牛车要一个多月，骑马半个多月，坐汽车得三天；而现在坐飞机，只要一个多小时就到了。由锡林浩特通往全盟农牧区的电话线密如蛛网。草原上各旗县和大部分人民公社，现在可以直接同首都北京和全国各地通长途电话。
