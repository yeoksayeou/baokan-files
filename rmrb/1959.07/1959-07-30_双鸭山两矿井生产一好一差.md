Shuangyashan Two Mines' Production: One Good, One Bad
Good: Conditions Not Good, Just Good Leadership Methods
Bad: Not Because Conditions are Bad, Just Poor Leadership Methods
Main Experiences: Whether Leading Cadres Go Deep into the Production Front Line; Whether Mechanical Equipment is Cared For and Inspected Regularly; Whether Advanced Experiences are Conscientiously Promoted According to Local Conditions

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 29th: The Sixth Mine of the Lingxi Coal Mine and the Sixth Mine of the Lingdong Coal Mine, under the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau, have different conditions. One has relatively poor conditions, and the other has relatively good conditions. However, due to different leadership styles and methods, the Sixth Mine of the Lingxi Coal Mine, which has poorer conditions, overfulfilled its production plan every month, while the Sixth Mine of the Lingdong Coal Mine, which has better conditions, lagged far behind.

The Lingxi Mine No. 6 mines small coalfields in marginal areas, with an average coal seam thickness of only 83 centimeters, and a very low proportion of mechanized production. About 90% of the coal is mined by blasting. In the first half of the year, this mine completed 166% of the state plan for coal mining and 188% for tunneling. In July, coal mining and tunneling exceeded production targets every day. As of the 20th, the upper and middle ten-day plans had been overfulfilled by 11% and 3% respectively. The Lingdong Mine No. 6 mines large coalfields, with an average coal seam thickness of more than one meter, and the proportion of mechanized production is higher than that of the Lingxi Mine No. 6. However, in the first half of the year, this mine did not complete the coal mining and tunneling plans well. As of July 20th, coal mining was short by more than 5,000 tons, and tunneling only completed 90.5% of the plan.

Why is the production of Lingxi Mine No. 6, which has poor conditions, good, while the production of Lingdong Mine No. 6, which has good conditions, is poor?

One reason is the difference in leadership style and methods. From the beginning of the year, Lingxi No. 6 Mine has been paying close attention to production and consulting with the masses on everything. The leaders of the Party, government, and trade union go to the production front line every day to work shifts, direct production, and discuss solutions with the masses when problems are found. At one time, production encountered the difficulty of insufficient coal carts. The mine leaders immediately mobilized the masses to offer suggestions, and quickly came up with methods such as "long-distance multiple hauls and fast runs, short-distance fewer hauls and more cycles," as well as planned vehicle allocation, fully tapping the potential of existing vehicles, and ensuring the normal operation of coal mining and tunneling without adding equipment. Lingdong No. 6 Mine did not pay close attention to production from the beginning of the year. Some leading cadres rarely went to the front line to direct production, and mostly made general arrangements at meetings. Although many cadre meetings were held and some measures were taken, these measures were not thoroughly discussed after extensively mobilizing the masses, and as a result, they were either divorced from reality or could not be implemented, and production did not improve much.

Another reason is the different management and use of mechanical equipment in the two mines. Lingxi Mine No. 6 has established a special responsibility system for each machine and conducts regular inspections to ensure that everyone cares for the mechanical equipment. Therefore, this mine has not had any major mechanical accidents since the beginning of the year. Lingdong No. 6 Mine did not resolutely implement some good systems, did not inspect and maintain machinery in a timely manner, and had poor maintenance, resulting in more accidents. As a result, it produced 52,700 tons less raw coal and tunneled 168.5 meters less roadway in the first half of the year.

Another reason is the different attitudes of the two mines towards advanced experiences. Lingxi No. 6 Mine regards the promotion of advanced experiences as an important part of technological innovation. They studied each of the 36 advanced experiences stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry and directly implemented them on the working face, conscientiously promoting them according to local conditions. The leaders of Lingdong No. 6 Mine did not specifically grasp this work, and even some leading cadres and workers did not know the 36 experiences that the Ministry of Coal Industry had decided to promote.

Currently, the leading cadres of Lingdong Mine No. 6 are conscientiously examining their work and striving to overfulfill the production plan for the third quarter.

### 双鸭山两矿井生产一好一差

    双鸭山两矿井生产一好一差
    好的：条件并不好只是领导方法好
    差的：并非条件差只是领导方法差
    主要经验  领导干部是否深入到生产第一线机械设备是否人人爱护及时检修先进经验是否因地制宜认真推广
    新华社哈尔滨29日电　双鸭山矿务局所属岭西煤矿六井和岭东煤矿六井，一个条件较差，一个较好，但是由于领导工作作风和工作方法不同，结果条件较差的岭西矿六井月月超额完成生产计划，条件好的岭东矿六井却远远落在后头。
    岭西矿六井采的是边边角角小煤田，平均煤层厚度仅八十三厘米，机械化生产比重很低，90％左右是用爆破方式采煤。这个井上半年采煤完成国家计划的166％，掘进完成188％；7月份采煤和掘进又日日超产，到20日为止，分别超额11％和3％完成上、中旬计划。岭东矿六井采的是大块煤田，煤层厚度平均达一米以上，机械化生产比重高于岭西六井。但是，这个矿井上半年采煤掘进计划完成得不够好，7月份到20日为止采煤欠产五千多吨，掘进仅完成计划90.5％。
    为什么条件差的岭西矿六井生产搞得好，条件好的岭东矿六井生产反而差呢？
    原因之一是，领导作风和领导方法不同。岭西六井从年初一开始，对生产一直抓的很紧，并且事事都同群众商量。党、行政、工会的领导干部每天都到生产第一线跟班劳动，指挥生产，发现问题同群众共同商量解决。有一个时期，生产中遇到炭车不足的困难，矿井领导干部马上发动群众献策，很快想出了“远程多拉快跑，近程少拉多循环”，以及计划配车等办法，充分挖掘了现有车辆潜力，没有增加设备就保证了采煤、掘进的正常进行。岭东六井年初一开始对生产就抓得不紧，有的领导干部很少深入第一线指挥生产，多是在会议上作原则部署。虽然召开不少干部会议，采取了一些措施，但是由于这些措施没有经过深入发动群众讨论，结果不是脱离实际，就是贯彻不下去，生产起色不大。
    另外一个原因是，两个矿井对机械设备管理和使用不同。岭西矿六井的每台机械都建立了专责制，并且定期检修，做到人人都爱护机械设备。因此，这个矿井从年初以来，没发生过重大机械事故。岭东六井有些好的制度没有坚决执行，对机械检修得不及时，保养不好，事故较多，上半年因此少产原煤五万二千七百多吨，少掘进巷道一百六十八点五米。
    还有一个原因是，两个矿井对待先进经验的态度不同。岭西六井把推广先进经验作为技术革新的重要内容。煤炭工业部规定推广的三十六项先进经验，他们都逐项研究，直接落实到工作面，因地制宜地认真推广。岭东六井领导上却没有具体地抓这项工作，甚至有的领导干部和工人，还不知道煤炭工业部决定推广的三十六项经验。
    目前岭东矿六井的领导干部正在认真检查工作，争取超额完成三季度生产计划。
