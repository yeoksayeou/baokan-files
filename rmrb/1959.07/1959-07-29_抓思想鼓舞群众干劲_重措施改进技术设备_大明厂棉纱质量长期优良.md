Grasp Ideology to Inspire Mass Enthusiasm, Emphasize Measures to Improve Technology and Equipment
Daming Factory's Cotton Yarn Quality Consistently Excellent

(Our dispatch) Chongqing Daming Textile and Dyeing Factory, in improving the quality of cotton yarn, grasped both ideology and measures; it not only vigorously launched mass movements in a swift and decisive manner but also comprehensively and meticulously strengthened production management. They skillfully combined enthusiasm and methods, focusing on key issues and resolving general problems. From May of last year to the present, for fourteen months, the cotton yarn produced has been basically first-grade first-class, and they have even spun superior yarn.

In the past, the quality of Daming Factory's cotton yarn was poor, and the cloth woven was also substandard. When workers entered department stores, they feared being accused of producing inferior cloth, so they quietly removed the factory badge. Leading cadres were also afraid to discuss quality issues when attending meetings. Everyone urgently wanted to improve the quality of cotton yarn, but when analyzing the reasons for the poor quality, many attributed it to: the factory buildings being narrow, the walls being thin, making it difficult to control temperature and humidity; the machines being old, with many different brands, prone to malfunction; the technical force being weak, with no engineer in the spinning department, etc. They believed that relying on these conditions, it would be extremely difficult to improve the quality of cotton yarn, therefore, they held a "fatalistic" attitude. As a result, the quality of cotton yarn could not be improved for a long time.

Was the situation really like this? The factory Party committee held several meetings to discuss and study. They sent people to visit the Shashi Yarn Factory. Those who returned said: the other factory's buildings, equipment, and raw cotton were similar to those of our factory, but they spun superior yarn; looking at some of the teams and groups in our factory, working on the same machine, the yarn spun was sometimes good and sometimes bad. This proved that the quality of cotton yarn was not just a matter of equipment, but more importantly, the people's thinking. The factory Party committee used these facts to mobilize everyone to discuss: who or what decides the quality, people or machines? During the discussion, everyone specifically analyzed the reasons affecting the quality of cotton yarn from the perspective of a team, a piece of yarn, and a day's production. The cotton cleaning section checked themselves for being afraid of trouble and not seriously implementing the operating procedures of "taking cotton from multiple packages and blending flowers in small amounts"; the temperature and humidity group used examples to show that as long as they actively thought of solutions, the existing factory buildings could also control temperature and humidity; the workers also exposed some shortcomings in the management work of the departments. Through analysis and discussion, everyone became more clear that the poor quality of cotton yarn in the past was mainly a matter of work, and therefore consciously overcame shortcomings, carefully operated, and mutually supervised and inspected, quickly launching a mass upsurge in improving the quality of cotton yarn.

After the masses were mobilized, some people believed that all problems could be solved by relying solely on this enthusiasm, and when the issue of material and equipment conditions was raised, they criticized it as "the theory of conditions only." The factory Party committee promptly pointed out the inaccuracy of this view, educating everyone to correctly understand the role of people and things. The narrow factory buildings and old machines did indeed greatly affect the quality of cotton yarn. In order to solve these problems realistically, the factory concentrated its machine repair forces to overhaul the backward machines. Then, it revised the maintenance and upkeep system so that all machines could operate normally. The factory buildings were narrow, and the ventilation and cooling equipment was insufficient, so they used the power outage time to adjust the area differences between machines and machines, increasing the spacing, making the factory buildings easier to dissipate heat; they used old water pipes to transform them into sprayers, expanding the spray area and reducing breakages. These measures did not cost much money but were quickly effective, not only rapidly improving the quality of cotton yarn, but also boosting the production morale of the masses.

In the movement to improve the quality of cotton yarn, this factory vigorously strengthened basic work, on the one hand, steadily promoting advanced experience and improving technical level; on the other hand, establishing and improving a set of scientific management systems to ensure the quality of cotton yarn.

At the same time, the Party committee secretary, the factory director, and the technical cadres of various departments also went deep into the workshops to work alongside the workers, grasping both major issues and trivial matters, helping the masses to summarize and promote advanced experience. As a result, in a very short period of time, the entire factory achieved "full marks" in "joining rate, white spot rate, breakage rate, and spindle watching number," so that the quality of cotton yarn has long been maintained at first-grade first-class, and superior yarn has been spun.

    抓思想鼓舞群众干劲　重措施改进技术设备
    大明厂棉纱质量长期优良
    本报讯　重庆大明纺织染厂在提高棉纱质量当中，既抓思想又抓措施；既雷厉风行地大搞群众运动，又全面细致地加强生产管理工作，把干劲和办法，突击重点和解决一般问题，巧妙结合起来。从去年5月到现在，十四个月来生产出来的棉纱基本上都是一等一级品，而且还纺出了上等纱。
    过去，大明厂棉纱质量不好，织出的布也不好，工人们进百货商店，怕人指责自己生产次布，悄悄的把厂章取下；领导干部出去开会，也怕谈质量问题。大家都迫切要求提高棉纱质量，但是一分析到棉纱不好的原因，不少人就把它归结为：厂房窄小，墙壁单薄，难以控制温湿度；机器老，牌号多，爱出毛病；技术力量单薄，纺部没有一个工程师，等等。他们认为依靠这些条件，要想提高棉纱质量是难上加难，因此，抱着“听天由命”的态度。这样一来棉纱质量长期不能提高。
    情况难道果真如此吗？厂党委几次开会讨论研究。他们派人参观了沙市纱厂，回来的人说：人家的厂房、设备和用的原棉都和本厂差不多，可是纺出了上等纱；再从本厂的一些班、组来看，在同一台机器上工作，而纺出的纱却有好有坏。由此证明，棉纱质量的好坏，不只是设备问题，重要的还是人们的思想。厂党委便用这些事实发动大家讨论：决定质量的是人还是机器？讨论中，大家从一个组、一件纱、一天的生产，具体分析影响棉纱质量好坏的原因。清花工段检查了自己怕麻烦，没有认真贯彻“多包取棉、少量和花”的操作规程；温湿度小组用实例说明，只要积极想办法，现有的厂房也可以控制温湿度；工人们还揭发出科室管理工作上的一些缺点。经过分析讨论，大家更加明确过去棉纱质量不好，主要是工作问题，因而自觉地克服缺点，认真操作，互相监督检查，很快地掀起了一个群众性提高棉纱质量的热潮。
    群众发动起来以后，有些人认为光是凭这股干劲就可以解决一切问题，一提物资设备条件，便批评是“唯条件论”。厂党委及时指出了这种看法的不对，教育大家正确的认识人和物的作用。厂房窄、机器旧确实在很大程度上影响棉纱质量。为了实事求是地解决这些问题，厂里集中了机修力量，对落后机台进行了检修。接着又修订了保养保全制度，使所有的机器都能正常运转。厂房窄小，通风降温设备不够，便利用停电时间调整了机台与机台的区域差异，加大了间距，使厂房易于散热；利用旧水管改装成喷雾器，扩大了喷雾面积，减少了断头。这些措施花钱不多，收效很快，不但迅速提高了棉纱质量，而且也鼓舞了群众的生产情绪。
    在提高棉纱质量的运动中，这个厂大力加强了基础性的工作，一方面踏踏实实地推广先进经验，提高技术水平；一方面建立和健全了一套保证棉纱质量的科学管理制度。
    同时，党委书记、厂长和各部门的技职干部，也深入车间跟班劳动，既抓重大问题，也抓点滴小事，帮助群众总结和推广先进经验。结果，在很短的时间内，全厂实现了“接头率、白点率、断头率、看锭数”的满堂红，使棉纱质量长期保持在一等一级品，并纺出了上等纱。
