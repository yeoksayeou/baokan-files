	Speaking and Writing
	Guo Jifang
	In the past, when I heard about promoting Mandarin in Beijing, I didn't feel much. It wasn't until I came to work in Shanghai that I realized the profound meaning behind it.
	Almost all northerners who come to Shanghai for the first time have a common feeling, which is not acclimatization, but language barrier. What does "格木斯哈伯朗塞扎，侬宰奈特弗来斯!" mean? After "translation," it turned out to be "This thing only has three pieces in total; you can't take them all!". Other examples include: 白相 meaning to play, 交关 meaning many, and so on, too numerous to list.
	Over time, I discovered that many comrades in Shanghai also speak Mandarin fluently; it is both accurate and clear. Unfortunately, they only speak it when they encounter northerners. At one stage, conductors on public transportation vehicles also spoke Mandarin, and although it was for learning purposes, the results were significant, adding great convenience to passengers from other places. Unfortunately, this was not sustained.
	The fundamental reason is that speaking Mandarin has not yet become a trend. Conversely, some non-locals who can speak Mandarin, in order to facilitate their work and "adapt to the environment," slowly begin to speak a smattering of Shanghai dialect. The two sides "move closer to the middle," which is considered a temporary solution. The sound of Mandarin that everyone is looking forward to has not yet resounded like a thunderclap.
	Even, I still occasionally read words like "我伲" (we) and "交关" (many) in newspapers, and I can't help but think about writing in Mandarin from speaking in Mandarin, and I feel that there are some problems in this regard as well.
	It is certainly awkward for northerners to not understand Shanghai dialect, but because they live in Shanghai, they can generally understand it without a teacher after listening to it a few more times. However, it is even more awkward for Shanghainese (and by extension, southerners) to not "understand" the northern language in books, or for northerners to not "understand" the southern language in books. Moreover, because the regions are different, there is often no opportunity to listen, ask for advice, or find a "translator," so they swallow it whole at the time, and then vaguely put it behind their minds. If they don't understand, and it's not easy to understand, what can the readers do?
	Let's take an example: "老蔫… after a long-awaited rest… is really not bad, working hard! … The enemies are kicking their heels and running towards the place where the guns are firing, … the other side is still gleefully cheating, … not knowing what nonsense they are talking about, … he slapped him and knocked him over." (Excerpt from Feng Zhi's "The Underground Armed Work Team Behind Enemy Lines," with emphasis added by the author). What is the exact meaning? How to "translate" it into Mandarin? When reading these parts, patient readers may have to speculate, while impatient readers will probably have to "skip" over them.
	Of course, I am not opposed to speaking local dialects and using dialects and vernacular in literary works. Local dialects are the product of history and society and cannot be unified all at once. Many vivid and figurative dialects and vernacular that are easily accepted by the masses are indeed charming and can add color to the work. I am just saying that unifying the Chinese language and everyone speaking Mandarin is the correct and inevitable direction. Everyone should open their voices and speak, encourage others to speak, and make it a trend. All articles - words written on paper - should also be in Mandarin. The situation where one needs to seek "translation" when listening to one's own national language and reading one's own national books should end.

    从前在北京，听到提倡普通话，倒还不觉得怎样。赶等到了上海工作，才体会到其寓意之深。
    北方人初到上海来，差不多都有共同的感觉，倒不是水土不服，而是言语不通。“格木斯哈伯朗塞扎，侬宰奈特弗来斯！”是什么意思？经过“翻译”，原来是“这东西一共只有三只，你全拿走不行！”。其它如：白相是游玩，交关是许多，等等不胜列举。
    久了，发现上海有不少同志说起普通话来也很流利；既准确，又清晰。可惜只是碰到北方人才说。有一个阶段，公共交通车辆上的售票员也说普通话，虽说是学习，成绩却不小，给外地来的乘客添了很大方便。可惜也没坚持下去。
    根本原因在于，说普通话还没有形成为一种风气。相反地，一些能说普通话的外地人为了工作方便和“适应环境”，也慢慢说起夹生的上海话来。双方来一个“向中间靠拢”，算是权安之计。大家盼望的普通话的声音，还没有如霹雳贯耳般响亮起来。
    甚至，还不时从报纸上读到“我伲”（我们）、“交关”之类的词句，不禁从说普通话又联想到写普通话，感到这方面也有些问题。
    北方人听不懂上海话，固然有些蹩扭，但因身居上海，只要多听几次，也就大致无师自通。而上海人（推而及于南方人）“看”不懂书上的北方话，或北方人
    “看”不懂书上的南方话，那种蹩扭滋味更是“或有
  甚焉”。而且由于地各南北，往往没有机会去听，去请教，去找“翻译”，于是当时囫囵吞枣咽到肚里，以后糊里糊涂搁在脑后。不懂，又不容易弄懂，又让读者怎么办呢？
    举个例子看：“老蔫……经过一长盼休整，……真是不赖歹，干的戗！……敌人都尥着蹶子朝响枪的地方跑，……对方还在得意卖骗，……不知胡吣些什么，……叫他一巴掌给扇了个栽不楞。”（摘自冯志著“敌后武工队”，着重点是作者加的）确切的意思是什么？怎样“译”成普通话？读到这些地方，耐心的读者恐怕只有揣摩，而急性子的读者大概只好“跳”过去罢。
    当然，我不反对说地方话和在文学作品中运用方言土语。地方话是历史的、社会的产物，不是一下子可以统一的。许多生动、形象化的易被广大群众接受的方言土语，也的确别具魅力，能使作品生色。我只是说，统一汉语，大家说普通话，这是正确的、必趋的方向，应该人人放开喉咙说，发动别人说，使之蔚为风气。一切文章——写在纸上的话，也都应当是普通话。那种听本国话和读本国书而需要求诸“翻译”的状况，该结束了。
