    Visiting Thai Binh Amidst the Sounds of Harvest
    By Our Correspondent Chen Jiabao

    Amidst the sounds of a bumper harvest in northern Vietnam in June, I visited Thai Binh province, the most fertile area in the Red River Delta. This year, the early rice crop achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest here. The average yield per hectare in the province reached 2.6 tons, a full doubling of the highest yield in the province during the French rule in 1939, and making it the province with the highest unit area yield of early rice in all of northern Vietnam.

    Arriving in Thai Binh in June, the first thing I heard were songs composed by farmers from agricultural cooperatives, singing about the bumper harvest of early rice. Farmers in Thu Tri district sang:

                Thousands of miles of rice fields ripple like golden waves,
                Heavy ears droop low,
                Heavy enough to carry on shoulders and in arms,
                Men, women, old and young are joyous.
                The old have lived a lifetime,
                Only now do they see "two harvests in one year."

    In the years before liberation, the farmers here had never seen a bumper harvest of early rice, let alone imagined that early rice could surpass the late rice crop. Because summer was a season of many disasters here, rice yields were always low. But this year's early rice not only exceeded previous early rice yields, but also surpassed the late rice crop in some counties, thereby breaking the superstition left over from the old society that "early rice cannot exceed late rice."

    The "Granary" Used to Suffer Famine

    Only by personally visiting the fields of Thai Binh could I truly understand the fertility and richness of the land in northern Vietnam. At the same time, it was also in Thai Binh that I once again realized that in order to strive for a bumper harvest, while favorable weather and geographical conditions are necessary, even more important is the strong will and determination of millions of people to overcome difficulties in order to build a new life.

    Thai Binh is located on the eastern edge of the Red River Delta, surrounded on three sides by the Red River, the Lo River, and the Tra Ly River, and is a fertile alluvial plain. Riding in a car here for an hour or two, I didn't see a single mountain shadow, only endless fields. The soil color is reddish-black, and experienced people told me that the soil contains rich organic phosphorus and other elements, which is very beneficial to the growth of rice and various subtropical crops.

    Not only is the land fertile and the climate warm, but the farmers also have a tradition of heroic hard work, "exchanging blood for grain." During the French rule, farmers risked their lives day and night planting and harvesting crops under the enemy's fortresses.

    But what is hard to imagine is that this province, known as the "granary" of North Vietnam, suffered famine every year before liberation. The most serious famine in 1945 took the lives of 300,000 people. Natural disasters and man-made calamities caused farmers' incomes to decline year after year. Poor, hired, and middle peasants generally lacked grain for three to eight months each year. This was the key reason why the "granary" suffered famine.

    Today, when they mention those days before liberation, the poor farmers of Thai Binh still remember them vividly. In their conversations, they often cannot suppress their deep hatred for the old society, and at the same time they all unanimously praised the contributions of the Labor Party and the land reform.

          Today, We Celebrate the Bumper Harvest Through Cooperation

    Since the liberation of Thai Binh in 1954, the dark days have been forever separated from the poor. Under the leadership of the Thai Binh Provincial Committee of the Labor Party, nearly one million farmers seized more than 20,000 hectares of land from landlords and Vietnamese traitors, and began to restore the wounds of war and build their new lives with selfless labor enthusiasm. For five years, rice yields have increased year after year, and in the first half of this year, when the cooperative movement began to develop rapidly, they created the first "miracle": the early rice crop in the province achieved a bumper harvest for the first time in history.

    If you were to ask: Why did the early rice crop achieve a bumper harvest this year? Then the answer from the provincial party secretary to the members of the agricultural cooperatives is almost the same. They said that the main reasons are the rapid development of the cooperative movement, the improvement of farming techniques, and the farmers' strong determination to overcome difficulties.

    At the beginning of the year, the Thai Binh Provincial Committee listed the development and consolidation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement as the key to striving for a bumper harvest this summer. After conducting extensive socialist education among farmers in all twelve counties, they further vigorously developed mutual aid teams and cooperatives. The farmers' awareness has been increasing day by day, and more and more people are asking to join the cooperatives. By May, the number of cooperatives had grown from 22 at the end of last year to more than 1,200.

    Cooperatives took the lead in small-scale water conservancy projects to overcome drought, and also accumulated a large amount of fertilizer, implemented deep plowing and rational close planting, thereby driving individual households and mutual aid teams to actively invest in the upsurge of "intensive cultivation and meticulous farming." The Gonghe Cooperative in Xingren County, which I visited, is a prominent example. Of the 27 households in this "poverty-stricken" cooperative, 22 were originally dirt-poor peasants. Relying on "unity and great enthusiasm," they led the farmers in the entire cooperative and the entire village to overcome the biggest drought in years, influenza, and promoted deep plowing and rational close planting. During this summer's harvest, the rice of this cooperative yielded much more than that of individual households, and the average income of the members increased by about 40% compared to when they worked individually.

    Comrade Wu Weiqi, the provincial party secretary, told me that according to statistics from more than 200 cooperatives in the province, their early rice yields this summer were generally 5% to 20% higher than those of individual households. He said: "After the victory of the summer harvest, a large number of farmers are now asking to join the cooperatives."

    The provincial party secretary is a strong and decisive middle-aged man. Three years ago, when he visited Beijing, we met once. Today, his forehead has added many wrinkles, but his energy is even more vigorous. He said:

  "Leading production is like leading combat, requiring a strong will and determination to overcome difficulties." He said: "This year's bumper harvest is inseparable from the hard work day and night of cadres and farmers throughout the province, and their tenacious spirit of resolutely overcoming drought, insect pests, and wind disasters. With this spirit, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome."

        Life is Getting Better Day by Day

    The bumper harvest of early rice has further improved the lives of farmers in Thai Binh province. In the Thai Binh City General Merchandise Company, I saw many farmers wearing brown clothes dyed with yam in purchasing plows, hoes, and dishes. The salesperson of the General Merchandise Company told me that this summer, the amount of agricultural tools and groceries sold to farmers has greatly increased compared to the same period last year.

    In the General Merchandise Company, Nguyen Huu Bich, a farmer from a cooperative in the suburbs of Thai Binh City, happily told me: "When I worked individually last year, I couldn't even afford a small cup. This year, I joined the cooperative, and the rice harvest is good, so I can buy new bowls and two piglets." Before leaving, he specifically instructed me: "Please don't forget to tell the Chinese farmers that we hear their leap forward news on the radio every day, and wish them more and more happiness every year!"

    丰收声中访太平
    本报记者　陈家保
    在越南北方6月的一片丰收声中，我访问了红河三角洲最富饶的太平省。这里今年夏稻获得了空前大丰收。全省平均每公顷产量达到二点六吨，比全省在法国统治时期产量最高的1939年增加整整一倍，并且成为全越南北方夏稻单位面积产量最高的省份。
    6月里来到太平，首先听到农业合作社的农民们编的歌谣，歌唱夏稻大丰收。书池县农民歌唱道：
                千里稻田翻金浪，
                穗儿累累垂着头，
                手抱肩挑千斤重，
                男女老少乐悠悠。
                老人活了一辈子，
                如今才见“两造秋”。
    在解放前的岁月里，这里的农民从未见过夏稻丰收的日子，更不敢想到夏稻能超过秋稻。因为夏季在这里是多灾多难的季节，稻子一向低产。可是今年的夏稻，产量不仅超过了历年夏稻，而且在一部分县还超过了秋稻，从而打破了旧社会留下的“夏稻不能超过秋稻”的迷信。
    从前“谷仓”闹饥荒
    只有亲临太平的田野，我才真正了解越南北方土地的肥沃和富饶。同时，也是在太平，我又一次体会到，为了争取丰收，固然需要天时和地利，但是更重要的是千百万人为了建设新生活而战胜困难的顽强意志和决心。
    太平位于红河三角洲的东陲，三面为红河、洛河和茶里河所环绕，是一片肥沃的冲积地。坐上汽车在这里奔驰个把钟头也没见半点山影，只见一片望不到边的田地。土色红里带黑，有经验的人告诉我，那地里含有丰富的有机磷等成分，非常有利于水稻和各种亚热带作物的生长。
    这里不仅土地肥沃，气候暖和，而且农民有着“以血换谷”的英勇勤劳的传统，在法国统治时期，农民就在敌人堡垒的脚下日夜抢种和抢收。
    可是令人难以想像的是，这个号称北越的“谷仓”的省分在解放前却年年闹饥荒，1945年最严重的一次饥荒夺去了三十万人的生命，天灾和人祸使农民的收入年年下降，贫、雇、中农每年一般缺粮三个月到八个月。
    解放前，太平的九万公顷田地，有30％的肥田归地主和越奸所有。高额地租、苛捐杂税和伕役像三根绞索紧紧地勒住农民的咽喉。这就是“谷仓”闹饥荒的关键所在。
    今天提起解放前这段日子，太平的贫苦农民记忆犹新。他们在谈话里往往压抑不住对旧社会的深恶痛绝，同时都不约而同地赞扬了劳动党和土地改革的功劳。
          今天合作庆丰收
    自从1954年太平解放后，黑暗的日子也从此同穷人永远分了手。将近一百万农民在劳动党太平省委会的领导下，从地主越奸手里夺回了二万多公顷田地，并且开始以忘我的劳动热情恢复战时的创伤和建设自己的新生活。五年来，这里的稻子年年增产，并且在合作化运动开始迅速发展的今年上半年里，创造了第一个“奇迹”：全省夏稻在历史上第一次获得了大丰收。
    如果要问：今年的夏稻为什么获得大丰收？那么从省委书记到农业社社员的答案几乎是一致的。他们说，最主要的原因是合作化运动的迅速发展，耕作技术的改进和农民们战胜困难的坚强决心。
    太平省委在年初就把发展和巩固互助合作运动列为争取今夏丰收的关键。全省十二个县在对农民广泛进行社会主义教育之后，便进一步大力发展变工组和合作社。农民的觉悟日益提高，要求入社的人愈来愈多。到了5月间，合作社从去年底的二十二个发展到一千二百多个。
    合作社带头搞小型水利，战胜旱灾，而且大量积肥，实行深耕和合理密植，从而带动了单干户和变工组积极投入了“深耕细作”的热潮。我访问的兴仁县共和合作社就是一个突出的例子。这个总共只有二十七户的“穷光蛋”社，有二十二户原是一贫如洗的贫农。他们凭着“人心齐，干劲大”，带动了全社和全村农民，战胜了历年最大的旱灾、流行性感冒，推广了深耕和合理密植。今年夏收的时候，这个合作社的稻子比单干户的收获量高得多，社员的平均收入比单干时增加了40％左右。
    省委书记吴维奇同志告诉我，根据省里二百多个合作社的统计，它们今夏稻子的收获量一般比单干户高5％到20％以上。他说：“经过夏收的胜利，目前有大量的农民正在要求入社。”
    省委书记是个刚强和果断的中年人。三年前，当他在北京参观时，我们有过一面之缘。今天看来，他的额上增添了不少皱纹，可是精力却是愈加旺盛了。他说：
  “领导生产和领导作战一样，需要战胜困难的刚强意志和决心。”他说：“今年的丰收是同全省干部和农民日夜苦干，坚决战胜旱灾、虫灾、风灾的顽强精神分不开的。有了这种精神就是天大的困难也能战胜。”
        日子一天好一天
    夏稻的丰收使太平省农民的生活得到进一步改善。在太平市杂货公司里，我看见许多身穿用薯莨染成的棕色服装的农民在购买犁铧、锄头和碗碟。杂货公司的售货员告诉我，今夏，已经出售给农民的农具和杂货比去年同时期大大增加了。
    在杂货公司里，太平市郊一个合作社的农民阮友壁愉快地对我说：“去年单干时，我连一个小杯子也买不起，今年入社，稻子丰收，我可以买进新碗和两头乳猪了。”临别时他特地嘱咐我：“请你别忘记转告中国的农民，我们每天都从广播里听到他们跃进的消息，祝他们一年比一年更加幸福！”（附图片）
