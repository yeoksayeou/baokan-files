Xinhua News Agency report: SANNIQUELLIE, Liberia: The leaders of three independent West African states—Ghana, Guinea, and Liberia—Nkrumah, Touré, and Tubman, issued a joint communiqué on the 19th after four days of talks, announcing that they will jointly work to establish a "Community of Independent African States." They drafted a statement of principles for the establishment of this "community," which will be submitted to the special conference of independent African states to be held in Liberia from August 4 to 8 for discussion.

The principles of the "Community of Independent African States" proposed at this conference stipulate that the overall policy of the community aims to help other African territories still under colonial rule to accelerate the end of their subordinate status. It also stipulates that all independent African states and federations can participate in the community, and federations or countries as members of the community will maintain their respective nationalities and constitutional structures; each member of the community accepts the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of any other country.

The joint communiqué also announced that the three countries intend to organize a West African conference as soon as possible after Nigeria, Togo, and Cameroon gain independence in 1960.

The leaders of the three countries also pledged to submit the Cameroon issue to the United Nations, believing that a free election under United Nations supervision before (Cameroon's) independence is the most effective and democratic way to resolve the current crisis.

The joint communiqué said that they also support including the Algerian issue on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. The joint communiqué stated that they will "endeavor to persuade France not to conduct its planned atomic bomb test in the Sahara Desert." They hope that the East-West talks in Geneva will be successful.

The "Ghana Times" published an editorial on the 22nd, welcoming the joint communiqué, saying that the three leaders "hope to establish a unified Africa and find possible solutions to the urgent problems of Africa." The newspaper also said that it is particularly gratifying that the meeting decided to raise the disputed Cameroon and Algeria issues in appropriate forums.

The "Xinwen Wanbao" also published an editorial on the 22nd, welcoming the joint communiqué.

    西非三国首脑举行会谈
    拟定“非洲独立国家共同体”原则
    本报综合报道：据新华社讯：桑尼涅勒（利比里亚）消息：西非三个独立国家——加纳、几内亚、利比里亚——的首脑恩克鲁玛、杜尔和杜伯曼19日在进行四天会谈以后发表一项联合公报，宣布他们将共同为成立一个“非洲独立国家共同体”而努力。他们拟订了建立这个“共同体”的一些原则的声明，将提交8月4日到8日在利比里亚举行的非洲独立国家特别会议加以讨论。
    这次会议提出的“非洲独立国家共同体”的原则规定，共同体的总政策的目的是帮助其它仍受统治的非洲领地加速结束它们的附属地位。它还规定，所有非洲的独立国家和联邦都可以参加共同体，作为共同体成员的联邦或者国家都将保持各自的国籍和宪法结构；共同体的每个成员都接受不干涉任何其它国家内政的原则。
    联合公报还宣布，这三个国家打算尽早在1960年尼日利亚、多哥和喀麦隆获得独立之后组织一个西非国家会议。
    这三个国家的首脑还保证要把喀麦隆问题提交联合国，认为在（喀麦隆）独立前举行联合国监督下的自由选举是解决目前危机的最有效和民主的方法。
    联合公报说，他们还支持把阿尔及利亚问题列入联合国大会议程。联合公报说，他们将“努力说服法国不要在撒哈拉大沙漠进行计划中的原子弹试验”。他们希望日内瓦东西方会谈将取得成功。
    22日“加纳时报”发表社论，对联合公报表示欢迎说，这三位领袖“希望建立统一的非洲和找出解决非洲迫切问题的可能的办法。”这家报纸还说，特别令人高兴的是，会议决定在适当的场所提出争论中的喀麦隆和阿尔及利亚问题。
      “新闻晚报”22日也发表社论，欢迎这项联合公报。
