    Climbing Diary

    The Fourth Height
      July 6th.
    Today the weather is clear, and according to the scheduled plan, we are advancing towards the fourth height, which is 7,200 meters above sea level.
    Yesterday, all forty-seven members of the climbing team reached the third high mountain camp. This morning, after waking up, some of the team members who had severe altitude sickness experienced even worse symptoms. For the sake of climbing safety, the team headquarters sent Peng Shuli, an instructor familiar with ice and snow operations and in good physical condition, to escort four male and female team members with severe reactions down the mountain. The other team members continued to move forward. At this time, all that could be seen was a boundless snowfield more than a hundred meters thick, with very soft snow. Six experienced athletes led the way. The snow was knee-deep, and they struggled to alternate their steps. Each time they lifted their hind leg, their front foot would sink half a foot deep, and it would take two or three tries to create a footprint that would make it easier for those behind to move. This type of trail-blazing work consumed a great deal of energy, causing them to sweat even on the cold snow.
    We were approaching 7,000 meters. The Tibetan female team member, Chi Lai, suffered severe headaches due to oxygen deficiency and low pressure, and vomited every few steps. For the male team member, Liu Qiming, lifting a foot was as difficult as lifting a thousand-kilogram tripod. But they still gritted their teeth and persevered. One step, two steps... When they reached over 7,000 meters above sea level, Chi Lai vomited even more violently, and Liu Qiming also collapsed. The team headquarters immediately called Hu Deming, a meteorologist from the front, and asked him to send them both back to base camp. Hu Deming turned around and looked at the summit of "Father of Ice Mountains." All the comrades were watching him. Yes, the summit of Muztagh Ata was so close. Was it more important to escort the sick comrades down the mountain, or to seize the main peak and gain personal honor? The mountainside was silent for a moment. Hu Deming suddenly turned around and said to the instructor, "I will definitely escort the comrades down the mountain safely and resolutely complete the task!" The comrades beside him were so moved that their eyes welled up with tears. The three team members said goodbye to the main team climbing towards the summit. They waved to the advancing team from afar, as if saying: We wish you a victorious return and win honor for the motherland and the people!
    Along the way, the advancing team frequently saw yellow water vomited by team members and snow pits created by falls. The road was so difficult, but with each step forward, the summit of Muztagh Ata came one step closer. The team members in front finally climbed to the fourth high mountain camp—7,200 meters above sea level—step by step at 20:00 Beijing time. It was only three hundred and forty-six meters away from the main peak.
    Shen Jie, a photographer from the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, had been suffering from severe altitude sickness since yesterday and was unable to sleep at night. Today, he would fall asleep after walking only a short distance; but as soon as he woke up, he insisted on moving forward. When he reached the fourth high mountain camp, he got busy. He opened the movie camera. He took off his sunglasses and removed the strips from his cold-proof down gloves. The high mountains were so cold that his hands were frostbitten and blistered within a few minutes of winding the camera. He raised the camera and suddenly realized that his eyes, which had been constantly stimulated by ultraviolet rays for several days due to filming, were now unable to see anything within a few minutes due to the greater intensity of solar radiation. He had originally wanted to follow the climbing team to the summit and produce a colorful newsreel, but now he had snow blindness only three hundred meters away from the summit, and his hands were frostbitten and blistered, making it impossible to continue working. Therefore, he felt very sad.
    In order to complete this colorful film, after returning to the tent, Shen Jie explained in detail to Comrade Shi Zhanchun the requirements and operating procedures for photographing the main peak, and entrusted Comrade Shi Zhanchun to assist in the filming of this film. Comrade Shi Zhanchun resolutely agreed.
    We will climb the main peak tomorrow. The main peak, what an exciting word!

    登山日记
    王凤桐　杨克现
    第四高度
      7月6日。
    今天天气晴朗，根据预定计划向第四高度即拔海七千二百米的地方前进。
    昨天四十七名登山队员全部到达了第三号高山营地。今晨一觉醒来，原来有些高山反应严重的队员更加严重了。为了登山安全起见，队部派熟悉冰雪作业、身体健壮的教练员彭淑力把四名反应严重的男、女队员护送下山。其他队员继续前进。这时候，眼前尽是一百多米厚的看不见边际的雪原，积雪十分松软。六个有经验的运动员在前面开路。雪深没膝，他们艰难的更换着双脚，每当抬起后腿的一刹那，前脚就陷下去半尺深，两三次才能踩出一只为后面人行动方便的脚印。这样的开路工作，耗费体力很大，使他们在严寒的雪地上都出汗了。
    接近七千米了。藏族女队员尺来因为缺氧和低压头疼厉害，走几步路就呕吐一次；男队员刘启明要提起一只脚也像提起千斤鼎一样困难。但他们还是咬着牙坚持着。一步、两步……到拔海七千米以上时，尺来呕吐更厉害了，刘启明也躺倒了。队部立刻从前面叫来了气象工作者胡德铭，让他把他们两个人送回大本营。胡德铭转身望了望“冰山之父”的峰顶。所有的同志都在注视着他。是的，慕士塔格山的顶峰已是这么近了，究竟是护送有病的同志下山重要，还是眼看就要夺到主峰获得个人荣誉重要呢？山坡上寂静了一会。胡德铭猛地转过身来对着指导员说：“我一定安全护送同志们下山，坚决完成任务！”在旁的同志激动得眼睛都湿润了。三名队员向攀登主峰的大队告别了，他们在很远的地方还向前进的队伍招手，似乎在说：祝你们胜利归来，为祖国为人民争得荣誉！
    前进的队伍一路上不时看见有队员呕吐的黄水和摔交所跌成的雪坑。道路是这样艰难，但只要前进一步，慕士塔格山顶便近了一步。前面的队员终于在北京时间二十点时一步一步爬到了第四号高山营地——拔海七千二百米的地方。这里离主峰只差三百四十六米的高度了。
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂的摄影师沈杰，从昨天开始，高山反应严重，夜间不能安睡。今天走不远的路就睡倒了；但一清醒过来他又坚持前进。到达第四号高山营地了，他便忙了起来。他打开电影机器。一面摘去太阳镜，一面卸去了御寒的鸭绒手套上条。高山是这样寒冷，在他上条的几分钟内手便冻青起泡了。他把机器举起来，忽然发觉几天来因为拍摄电影受到紫外线不断刺激的眼睛，这次因为太阳辐射强度更大，几分钟内便看不见东西了。他原想一直跟着登山队攀登到顶峰，摄制完成一部五彩新闻纪录电影，现在在只差三百多米的高度时却得了雪盲，手也冻得起泡不能继续工作了，因此感到十分难过。
    为了完成这部五彩影片，回到帐篷后，沈杰详细地向史占春同志交代了攀登主峰的摄影镜头的要求和操作规程，委托史占春同志一定协助完成这部影片的拍摄工作。史占春同志毅然答应了。
    明天就要攀登主峰了。主峰，这是个多么激动人心的名词啊！
