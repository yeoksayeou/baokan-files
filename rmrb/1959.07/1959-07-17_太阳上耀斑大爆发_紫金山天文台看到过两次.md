Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th - The Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences observed two "large eruptions" of solar flares on the 10th and 14th.

The flare on the 10th started at 10:00 AM and lasted for more than two hours. During the development of the flare, the brightness and area changed significantly. At its brightest, it occupied three thousandths of the solar hemisphere's area (about fifteen times the area of the Earth). A few minutes after the flare occurred, disturbances occurred in the Earth's ionosphere, and shortwave radio communication was disrupted, only starting to recover after more than an hour.

At 11:40 AM on the 14th, a flare appeared again in the same group of sunspots, lasting for more than two hours. A few minutes after the flare appeared, ionospheric disturbances and shortwave radio communication disruptions occurred again.

From 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM on the 10th, geomagnetic disturbances occurred. A magnetic storm occurred at 4:24 PM on the 11th. This flare originated in a group of sunspots that had just rotated out from the east side of the sun. This group of sunspots will disappear on the west side of the sun around the 20th of this month.

    太阳上耀斑大爆发
    紫金山天文台看到过两次
    新华社南京16日电　中国科学院紫金山天文台在10日和14日两次观测到太阳上耀斑“大爆发”。
    10日的耀斑从上午十时开始，延续两个多小时。在耀斑发展过程中，亮度和面积有很大的变化。最亮时，占有太阳半球面积的千分之三（约十五倍地球的面积）。耀斑发生后几分钟，地球电离层发生扰动，短波无线电通讯受到破坏，一个多小时才开始恢复。
    14日十一时四十分，在同一群黑子上再次出现耀斑，连续有两小时多。耀斑出现几分钟后，又发生电离层扰动和短波无线电通讯受到破坏的现象。
    10日十时至十二时半，有地磁扰乱发生。11日十六时二十四分有磁暴发生。这个耀斑产生在刚从太阳东边转出来的黑子群上，这群黑子大约将于本月20日在太阳西边消失。
