    Increase Chemical Production by Every Possible Means

    Since the beginning of this year, the output of chemical products in our country has been increasing month by month. Compared with the same period last year, the output of sulfuric acid increased by 18.5%, soda ash by 24.5%, caustic soda by 29.5%, synthetic ammonia by 16.4%, ammonium nitrate by 58.9%, tires by 37.8%, and antibiotics by five times. The facts of the past five months show that the growth of chemical industrial production in our country is very large. However, we must also see that there is still a distance between the production of chemical industrial products and the needs. This is not because the chemical industry is growing too slowly, but because the industrial sectors, especially the heavy industrial sectors, are developing particularly rapidly, and the needs of agriculture, transportation, the market, etc. are also increasing sharply. Therefore, chemical products cannot yet meet the needs of all parties.

    Due to the characteristics of the chemical industry, such as having many industries, many varieties, being able to use materials from various economic sectors as raw materials, and serving various sectors of the national economy, the chemical industry has formed an indissoluble bond with all aspects. The impact of the chemical industry on the heavy industrial sectors is already well known to many people. In order to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, develop irrigation and drainage, and increase the production of grain, vegetables, and various cash crops, a large amount of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and rubber products are needed. The production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, fishery, light industry, textile industry, and handicraft industry, which provide commodities to the market, are also inseparable from the chemical industry. The production processes of pharmaceuticals, paper, matches, soap, glass, enamel, food, etc. in the light industry sector, and the dyeing process in the textile industry all require a large amount of chemical raw materials and products. In the production of handicrafts, the scope of application of chemical raw materials and chemical products is also extremely wide. Taking the enterprises under the Tianjin Municipal Handicraft Bureau as an example, their eighteen industries have a total of more than 310 factories, more than 10,000 product varieties, and an annual output value accounting for about 30% of Tianjin's annual industrial output value. About 70% of these industries need chemical products as raw materials for production.

    It can be seen from this that in order to ensure the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production and the needs of market supply, we must do everything possible to greatly increase the production of chemical products.

    There are two basic ways to increase the production of chemical products. One is to strive to increase the new production capacity of the chemical industry, and the other is to further tap the potential of existing chemical enterprises. Increasing new production capacity is the fundamental way to increase the production of chemical products and change the backwardness of the chemical industry. Therefore, we must seize the capital construction work of the chemical industry with great efforts. At present, we should especially seize the finishing work and other key projects that can produce results quickly, and strive to put them into production as soon as possible to provide products. However, increasing new production capacity takes time, and it cannot achieve immediate results for the current urgent needs. Under the current situation, the main task of increasing the production of chemical products must be undertaken by existing chemical production enterprises. These enterprises must further mobilize the masses and carry out in-depth production increase and economy campaigns centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. In increasing production, we must pay close attention to improving product quality, reducing consumption quotas, and strengthening maintenance and repair work. At the same time, we must strengthen the management of enterprises and organize the supply of raw materials well, in order to achieve the goal of good quality, low cost, and large-scale production increase.

    In the production increase and economy campaign of chemical enterprises, the reason why we emphasize improving product quality is that improving product quality and reducing the scrap rate are important aspects of increasing production and saving. For example, if the mileage of each car tire is increased by 10,000 kilometers, it is equivalent to increasing the production of tires by 20%-30% for the country every year, which is a great wealth. As for medicines, it is even more related to the safety of patients, and quality must be guaranteed. Therefore, all chemical enterprises must strictly implement the quality inspection system for raw materials and products, operate correctly in strict accordance with the process regulations, strive to improve the product qualification rate, and prohibit products that do not meet quality standards from leaving the factory.

    The reason why we propose to reduce consumption quotas is that the raw materials required for chemical products are of many varieties and large in quantity. Reducing the consumption quotas of these raw materials can produce more products with the same amount of raw materials. Under the current situation that the supply of raw materials for chemical products is not abundant, reducing the consumption quota of raw materials is equivalent to increasing the source of raw materials. Therefore, all chemical enterprises must first realize the national quota, and formulate reasonable and advanced raw material and fuel consumption quotas according to the development of production, strengthen the original records and statistics of raw material consumption, strengthen the measurement of raw material consumption, and implement the principle of "saving use, recycling, comprehensive utilization, and finding substitutes" on the premise of ensuring quality, strictly implement the material requisition and return system, and strengthen economic accounting work.

    The reason why equipment maintenance and repair work must be strengthened is that chemical production is generally carried out under specific temperatures and pressures. Most of the gases and liquids in the production process are acidic, alkaline or other corrosive, which can easily corrode equipment. If the equipment is damaged, it will cause leakage, blockage, and loss of a large amount of raw materials, semi-finished products, or products; in severe cases, it will cause major accidents such as fire, explosion, and poisoning. At the same time, chemical production is continuous. As long as there is an accident in one piece of equipment or one section, it will affect the production of the entire enterprise. Therefore, chemical enterprises must attach great importance to equipment maintenance and repair work. All chemical enterprises must quickly strengthen the management of equipment, establish and improve a practical equipment maintenance and repair system, strengthen the education of employees on the protection of equipment and safe production, adhere to planned preventive maintenance, strengthen the manufacture of spare parts, and gradually reserve necessary spare parts.

    To quickly improve the above three aspects of work, it is impossible without strong production organization work and without strengthening management. In the rectification movement and large-scale mass production movement in 1958, the management work of chemical enterprises underwent major reforms and achieved great results. This is one of the basic reasons why chemical enterprises were able to achieve a great leap forward in production in 1958. However, in the Great Leap Forward, many chemical enterprises have not seriously consolidated and improved the experience gained in reforming management work, making it a new system and a new working method that all employees jointly abide by. We should strive to further strengthen and improve enterprise management in the next month or two to meet the needs of continued leap forward.

    Strengthening and improving enterprise management includes many different contents, such as planning management, technical management, financial management, and so on. The various industries of the chemical industry have commonalities, but they also have different characteristics and different situations. Therefore, the requirements cannot be uniform. We should strengthen the management system of those weak links first according to the specific situation of the enterprise itself and targeting the weak links in the management work. At the same time, this work should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. There is a common requirement for strengthening and improving the management of chemical enterprises, that is, to combine with the mass movement and use the method of the mass line to achieve the purpose of improving management.

    In order to increase the production of chemical products, we must organize the supply and allocation of raw materials well. The supply of raw materials is important to any industry, but it is particularly heavy in the chemical industry. The reason is that the matching work of raw materials is very important in chemical industry production. In the chemical industry, one product often requires 20, 30, or even 40 or 50 kinds of raw materials, and it is difficult to carry out production if there is a shortage of even one (even if it is relatively minor) material. At the same time, chemical industry raw materials not only come from the chemical sector itself, but also a large number of raw materials and materials come from all major economic sectors, such as coal, metallurgy, petroleum, building materials, light industry, textile, and handicraft production sectors. Therefore, organizing the supply of raw materials and materials is one of the most important tasks of the chemical sector; it is also the task of all relevant departments. All departments should promote the spirit of communist cooperation, work together, support each other, and strive to greatly increase the production of chemical products to serve all sectors of the national economy.

    Now the third quarter has just begun, which is an important quarter for completing this year's production increase plan. We must go all out, seize the opportunity, do everything possible, and work hard for three months to make the production increase and economy campaign on the chemical front develop more deeply, and greet the great 10th anniversary of the National Day with new production achievements.

    千方百计增产化工产品
    今年以来，我国化工产品的产量逐月上升，今年1至5月份同去年同期相比，硫酸增长18.5％，纯碱增长24.5％，烧碱增长29.5％，合成氨增长16.4％，硝铵增长58.9％，轮胎增长37.8％，抗菌素增长五倍。五个月的事实说明，我国化学工业生产的增长是很大的。可是，我们也要看到，化学工业产品的生产同需要之间，还有一个距离。这并不是因为化学工业增长得太慢，而是因为工业各部门，尤其是重工业部门发展得特别迅速，农业、交通、市场等方面的需要也激剧增加。因而化工产品还不能满足各方面的需要。
    由于化学工业具有行业多，品种多，能使用多种经济部门的物资作为原料，并为国民经济各部门服务等特点，使化学工业同各个方面都结下了不解之缘。化学工业对于重工业各部门的影响，已经是很多人都知道的了。为了防治病虫害，发展排灌事业，增产粮食、蔬菜和各种经济作物，需要大量的化肥、农药和橡胶制品。向市场提供商品的农、林、牧、副、渔、轻工、纺织业和手工业等方面的生产，也都离不开化学工业。轻工业方面的药品、纸张、火柴、肥皂、玻璃、搪瓷、食品等生产过程和纺织业的印染过程中都需要大量化工原料和产品。在手工业的生产中，应用化工原料和化工产品的范围也极广泛。以天津市手工业局所属企业来说，它们的十八个行业，共有三百一十多个工厂，产品品种一万多个，年产值约占天津市工业年产值的30％。这些行业中约有70％左右需要以化工产品为原料才能进行生产。
    由此可见，为了力求保证工农业生产的不断发展和市场供应的需要，必须千方百计，大力增产化工产品。
    增产化工产品的基本途径有二。一是努力增加化学工业的新生产能力，二是进一步发挥现有化工企业的潜力。增加新生产能力，是增产化工产品、改变化学工业落后面貌的根本途径，因此我们必须以极大的努力抓紧化学工业的基本建设工作，在当前应当特别抓紧扫尾工程和其他见效快的重点工程，争取尽早投入生产，提供产品。但是，增加新生产能力要有一个过程，对目前的迫切需要来说，不能收到立竿见影的效果。在目前的情况下，增产化工产品的主要任务，必须由现有的化工生产企业担负起来。这些企业必须进一步发动群众，深入开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。在增产中，要十分注意提高产品质量、降低消耗定额、加强维护检修等工作，同时加强企业的管理工作，组织好原材料的供应，以达到质量好、成本低同时大量增产的目的。
    在化工企业的增产节约运动中，所以要强调提高产品质量，是因为产品质量提高，废品率降低，乃是增产节约的重要方面。例如，每一条汽车轮胎的行驶里程增加一万公里，每年就等于替国家增产了20％—30％的轮胎，这是一笔很大的财富。至于药品，更关系到病人的安危，必须保证质量。因此，一切化工企业必须严格执行原料和产品的质量检查制度，严格按照工艺规程正确地操作，努力提高产品合格率，禁止不合质量标准的产品出厂。
    所以要提出降低消耗定额，是因为化工产品所需的原料品种多，数量也较大，降低这些原料的消耗定额，就可以用同样多的原料生产出更多的产品。在目前化工产品原材料供应不充裕的情况下，降低原材料的消耗定额，就等于增加了原材料的来源。因此，一切化工企业必须首先实现国家规定的定额，并根据生产的发展制订合理而先进的原材料和燃料消耗定额，加强原材料消耗的原始记录和统计，加强原材料消耗的计量工作，在保证质量的前提下，贯彻执行“节约使用，回收利用、综合利用、寻找代用”的方针，严格执行领料和退料制度，加强经济核算工作。
    设备维护和检修工作之所以必须加强，是因为化工生产一般是在特定的温度和压力下进行的，在生产过程中的气体、液体大都带有酸性、碱性或其他腐蚀性，极易腐蚀设备。设备损坏，轻则漏跑、堵塞，损失大量原料、半成品或产品；重则发生起火、爆炸、中毒等重大事故。同时，化工生产又是连续性的，只要有一个设备或一个工段出了事故，就会影响整个企业的生产。因此，化工企业必须十分重视设备的维护和检修工作。一切化工企业必须迅速加强设备的管理工作，建立和健全切实可行的设备维护检修制度，加强对职工进行爱护设备和安全生产的教育，坚持计划预修，加强备品备件的制造，并逐步储备必要的备品、备件。
    要迅速改善以上三方面的工作，没有强有力的生产组织工作，不加强管理，是不可能的。在1958年整风运动和大规模的群众生产运动中，化工企业的管理工作进行了重大改革，取得了很大成绩。这是1958年化工企业能够实现生产大跃进的基本原因之一。但是，在大跃进中，许多化工企业对于改革管理工作所取得的经验，还没有认真加以巩固和提高，使之成为全体职工共同遵守的新的制度和新的工作方法。我们应该争取在最近一两个月的时间内，进一步加强和改进企业管理，以适应继续跃进的需要。
    加强和改进企业管理包括很多不同的内容，如计划管理、技术管理、财务管理等等。化学工业的各个行业具有共同之处，但也有不同的特点和不同的情况，因此要求不能千篇一律，应该根据企业本身的具体情况，针对管理工作中的薄弱环节，首先加强那些薄弱环节的管理制度。同时应当有计划有步骤地进行这项工作。加强和改进化工企业的管理工作，有一个共同的要求，就是要同群众运动结合起来，运用群众路线的方法，来达到改进管理的目的。
    为了增产化工产品，必须组织好原材料的供应和调剂工作。原材料的供应对任何工业都是重要的，但在化学工业则显得特别繁重。原因是，化学工业生产中原材料的配套工作十分重要，在化学工业中，一种产品往往需要二、三十甚至四、五十种原料，而且只要缺一种（那怕是比较次要的）材料，也很难进行生产。同时，化学工业原料，不仅来自化工部门本身，而且有大量原料和材料，是来自所有主要经济部门，如煤炭、冶金、石油、建材、轻工、纺织以及手工业生产部门。因此，组织原料和材料的供应，是化工部门最重要的任务之一；同时也是所有有关部门的任务。各个部门应该发扬共产主义的协作精神，共同努力，相互支援，争取大量增产化工产品，为国民经济各部门服务。
    现在第三季度刚刚开始，这是一个完成今年增产计划的重要季度，我们必须鼓足干劲，抓紧时机，千方百计，大干三个月，使化工战线上的增产节约运动更加深入发展，以新的生产成就，来迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
