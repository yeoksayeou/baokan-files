    Hunan Rural Cadres Learn from Yang Hongdian

    Changsha, July 9th (Reported by this newspaper) — A movement to learn from good people and good deeds is underway in the vast rural areas of Hunan Province. This is an important method by which the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducts ideological education for grassroots cadres and masses in the province, striving for bumper harvests every season and abundant grain production throughout the year. After learning from the exemplary deeds of Yang Hongdian (see page 6 of this newspaper, July 7th) and Zhang Shougong (see page 4 of this newspaper, April 6th), grassroots cadres have greatly improved their ideological awareness. With everyone chasing and striving to be the first, work and production have taken on a new look. Through learning and discussion, more than 95,000 people in Yueyang County have made plans to catch up with Zhang Shougong's work attendance. The number of workers in the county has increased by 15.8% since rice transplanting. Through learning from Yang Hongdian's exemplary deeds, more than 600 cadres in Jilongjie Commune in Hengnan County have basically achieved thorough and solid work, consulting with the masses on everything. The working methods of grassroots cadres have been significantly improved.

    Yang Hongdian is a Party General Branch Secretary of a commune who wholeheartedly serves the people and adheres to the mass line working method; Zhang Shougong has the collectivist thinking that "when the big river has water, the small river is full; only when the country and the collective are prosperous can the family be prosperous." Last year, Zhang Shougong worked diligently and skillfully, earning a total of 7,103 work points, equivalent to the work of two people. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that if attention is paid to the ideological work of the vast grassroots cadres and commune members, making them love the collective and work hard like Zhang Shougong, and work diligently like Yang Hongdian, then the people's commune will definitely be run better, and the speed of socialist construction will definitely be faster. Therefore, it is required to launch a deep-going movement to learn from Yang Hongdian and Zhang Shougong in the vast rural areas of the province. Party committees at all levels in various places have strengthened the leadership of this movement in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Committee. Party committees at all levels in Changsha County personally lead and organize the learning. Many communes and brigades, through various forms of publicity such as printing publicity materials, writing slogans, and producing big-character posters and blackboards, have widely disseminated Zhang Shougong's exemplary deeds, deeply rooting them in people's hearts. Many places, in conjunction with current work, have convened meetings of production teams, work groups, commune member meetings, courtyard meetings, and field meetings for learning and discussion. In order to promote this learning, the New Hunan Daily has also opened a special column for discussion.

    In the movement to learn from Yang Hongdian and Zhang Shougong, some places have also selected local model figures, organized them to share their experiences, and educated cadres and the masses, with good results. At the beginning, some commune members in Yueyang County were skeptical about Zhang Shougong's exemplary deeds, and some even disbelieved them. In response to this situation, in addition to vigorously publicizing Zhang Shougong's deeds of "red thinking, diligence in everything, and skillful work," the county party committee decided to set up flags and establish role models locally. The county selected more than 8,000 Zhang Shougong-style labor models, and the county party committee commended Yin Yan'yi, a Zhang Shougong-style female labor model from Huangshajie People's Commune. She shared her experience of hard and skillful work. Matang Commune also organized twelve key members of communes and teams to visit the pig farm where Yin Yan'yi worked. Through the above methods, many people criticized their erroneous views and set off a wave of learning from models, catching up with models, and striving to become models.

    Because of using living people and events to educate the masses, the exemplary deeds of Yang Hongdian and Zhang Shougong were like thousands of red seeds sown in the hearts of the vast grassroots cadres and the masses. Many people take their deeds as a mirror, often check themselves against them, and strive to catch up with them and surpass them. Various places have also adopted the method of organizing labor competitions while learning, making learning an important driving force for winning a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. Tang Genhua, a model commune member of Fuxing Brigade in Tiaoma Commune, Changsha County, earned more than 4,000 work points last year. In a study meeting, he expressed his desire to surpass Zhang Shougong, and then he started to use his brain, pay attention to skillful work, and on the third day, when removing fertilizer from the pond, he used custom-made large baskets and wooden-toothed rakes, which increased work efficiency by more than two times compared with the past. Lei Guisheng, secretary of the Party Committee of Matian Commune in Yongxing, checked his work style against Yang Hongdian's deeds. In order to protect the lives and property of the masses, he took the lead in fighting the mountain flood. He disregarded his own life and jumped into the water three times to save the pond and save people. These actions inspired the fighting spirit of the masses and overcame the mountain flood, preventing more than 60 mu of rice seedlings from being washed away by the mountain flood. After the launch of the Zhang Shougong movement in Heping Brigade, 72 production team cadres and commune members have completed more than 450 work points in one month. Among them, three people have completed more than 500 points. In the past half month, the whole commune has expanded the grain planting area by 1,840 mu, accumulated 838,800 dan of manure, and eliminated 3,200 mu of third-class early rice seedlings.

    树标兵　立典范　千人学　万人赶
    湖南农村干部学习杨宏典
    本报长沙9日电　湖南省广大农村正在开展一个向好人好事学习的运动。这是中共湖南省委向全省农村基层干部和群众进行思想教育，夺取今年季季丰收、五谷丰登的一个重要方法。基层干部学习杨宏典（事迹见本报7月7日六版）、社员学习张守功（事迹见本报4月6日四版）的模范事迹以后，思想觉悟大大提高，群追众赶，奋发争先，工作和生产出现了崭新的面貌。岳阳县通过学习讨论，有九万五千多人订出了赶上张守功的出工计划，全县出工人数比插秧后增加了15.8％。衡南鸡笼街公社通过杨宏典模范事迹的学习，全公社六百多名干部基本上做到人人工作深入扎实，遇事同群众商量。基层干部的工作方法已有显著改进。
    杨宏典是全心全意为人民服务、坚持群众路线工作方法的公社党总支书记；张守功具有“大河有水小河满，国有社有家才有”的集体主义思想。去年张守功勤干、巧干，一共做了七千一百零三个劳动工分，相当于两个人做的活。中共湖南省委认为：注意作好广大的基层干部和社员群众的思想工作，使他们像张守功那样热爱集体、辛勤劳动，像杨宏典那样勤勤恳恳地工作，那么，人民公社就一定能办得更好，社会主义的建设速度就一定能够更快。因此，要求在全省广大农村中深入开展一个学习杨宏典、学习张守功的运动。各地各级党委都根据省委的指示，加强了这一运动的领导。长沙县各级党委都亲自领导和组织学习。许多公社和大队通过印发宣传资料、写标语、出大字报和黑板报等多种宣传形式，使张守功的模范事迹广为传播、深入人心。许多地方结合当前的工作，召开了生产队、作业组社员会和屋场会、田头会等学习讨论。为了推动这一学习，新湖南报还辟专栏开展讨论。
    在开展学习杨宏典、学习张守功的运动中，有的地方还选出本地的模范人物，组织他们现身说法，向干部和群众进行教育，效果很好。岳阳县开始时有的社员对张守功的模范事迹半信半疑，有的甚至不相信。针对这一情况，县委除了大张旗鼓地宣传张守功的“思想红、事事勤、会巧干”的事迹以外，决定就地竖旗帜，立榜样，全县一共评选出张守功式的劳动模范八千多人，县委表扬了黄沙街人民公社张守功式的女劳动模范尹燕宜，她现身说法，介绍自己苦干巧干的经验，麻塘公社还组织了十二个社队骨干分子在尹燕宜工作的养猪场参观。通过以上办法，很多人批判了自己的错误看法，掀起了学模范、赶模范、人人争取当模范的热潮。
    由于用活人活事教育群众，杨宏典、张守功的模范事迹便像千万颗红色的种子撒播到广大基层干部和群众的心里。许多人把他们的事迹当做一面镜子，经常检查对照自己，力争赶上他们，超过他们。各地还采取边学习边组织劳动竞赛的办法，使学习成为夺取今年农业大丰收的一个重要动力。长沙县跳马公社福兴大队模范社员唐根华，去年做了四千多个劳动工分，他在一次学习会上表示要争取赛过张守功后，开动脑筋，注意巧干，第三天出凼肥，他使用定做的大箢箕、木齿耙，比以往提高工效两倍多。永兴马田公社党委书记雷贵生对照杨宏典的事迹，检查了自己的工作作风以后，为了保护群众的生命财产，带头与山洪搏斗，他曾不顾自己生命危险，三次跳水救塘救人，这些行动激发了群众的斗志，战胜了山洪，使六十多亩禾苗没有被山洪冲毁。和平大队在学习张守功运动开展后，一月来就有七十二名生产队干部和社员做了四百五十多工分。其中有三名做了五百多分。半个月来，全社扩大粮食种植面积一千八百四十亩，积肥八十三万八千多担，并已消灭了早稻三类苗三千二百多亩。　（刘见初）
