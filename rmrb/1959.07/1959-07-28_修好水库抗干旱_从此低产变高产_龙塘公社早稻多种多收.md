Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 27th: The Longtang Commune in Leinan County, Guangdong Province, a region historically prone to drought and low yields, has achieved its first multiple and abundant harvest of early rice since communization.

The commune's early rice planting area expanded from 18,000 mu last year to 23,000 mu this year. Total output increased by 75.5% compared to last year, and the yield per unit area also increased by 40% compared to the same period last year.

The Longtang Commune is a low-yielding area that has long suffered from both drought and floods, and is also characterized by a small population and abundant land. Since communization last year, vigorous water conservancy construction has resulted in the completion of two large reservoirs benefiting more than 10,000 mu each, and five reservoirs irrigating more than 1,000 mu each. The commune's more than 30,000 mu of fields now have water conservancy facilities capable of resisting drought for more than 60 days, making the masses' long-cherished desire for high yields a possibility.

To achieve both increased planting and improved cultivation, the commune first deep-plowed 14,000 mu of farmland, leveled the land, and repaired self-flowing drainage and irrigation ditches, ensuring the water needs of the expanded planting area. At the same time, the entire commune also seized the initiative this year by preparing for cultivation early, selecting fine varieties, cultivating strong seedlings, implementing reasonable close planting, and applying sufficient base fertilizer. After transplanting, topdressing was applied three times, ensuring that the vast majority of seedlings grew evenly, resulting in a comprehensive bumper harvest.

    修好水库抗干旱　从此低产变高产
    龙塘公社早稻多种多收
    据新华社广州27日电　广东省雷南县一向干旱低产的龙塘公社，今年早稻获得公社化后第一次多种丰产多收。
    这个公社今年早稻种植面积从去年一万八千亩扩大到二万三千亩，总产量比去年增加了75.5％，单位面积产量也比去年同期增加四成。
    龙塘公社是长期受旱又受水灾的低产地区，而且人少地多。去年公社化以后，由于大搞水利建设，建成了两座受益面积万亩以上的大水库和五个灌溉一千亩以上的水库。全社三万多亩田开始有了能抗旱六十天以上的水利设备，这就使广大群众长期渴望高产的愿望成了可能。
    为实现种得多又种得好，这个公社首先将一万四千亩耕地深翻，平整了土地和修好自流排灌沟，保证扩种田用水的需要。同时，全社今年还抓紧了提早备耕，选用良种，培育壮秧，合理密植，施足底肥等措施。插秧以后又普遍追肥三次，使绝大部分禾苗生长平衡，获得全面丰收。
