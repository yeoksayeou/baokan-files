Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 1st: According to the Polish Press Agency on June 30th: The Polish and Bulgarian party and government delegations have issued a joint communiqué.

The communiqué states that during the talks, the party and government leaders of the two countries exchanged views on further developing cooperation between the two countries and two parties, as well as on the current international situation and the common struggle of the two peoples to safeguard peace.

Both sides unanimously pointed out that the role and influence of socialist countries on the development of the international situation are constantly expanding. The rapid growth of the economic and political strength of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries, and the unity of the socialist camp, have a decisive significance for the development of the international situation.

The communiqué states that the people of Poland and Bulgaria, as well as the people of all countries, expect the negotiations that have begun in Geneva to ease international tensions, especially to ensure European security. The governments of Poland and Bulgaria fully support the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union at the Geneva Conference.

The communiqué states that the governments of Poland and Bulgaria fully support the peaceful policies of the German Democratic Republic. This policy is a contribution to the struggle for solving the German problem on a peaceful and democratic basis, and it is in line with the interests of the people of all European countries and the interests of European peace. Both sides support all peaceful forces of the German people in their struggle to achieve this goal.

The communiqué pointed out that both sides believe that until a solid foundation for European collective security is established, the Warsaw Treaty remains an instrument for safeguarding the security of Poland, Bulgaria, and other socialist countries.

Both sides once again emphasized that the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe is a step towards reducing militaristic pressure in the region, and it can also consolidate European security.

Making the Balkans and the Adriatic region free of atomic weapons and rocket weapons, as well as foreign bases established for these weapons, will also be able to ease tensions and lead to peaceful cooperation among the countries in the region.

The communiqué states that the People's Republic of Poland fully supports the efforts of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to consolidate peace in the Balkans and develop good-neighborly relations between the countries in the region.

The communiqué pointed out that both sides will unswervingly strengthen friendship, alliance, and solidarity with the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, which is the foundation of the two countries' policies.

The communiqué states that the delegation of the Polish United Workers' Party and the delegation of the Bulgarian Communist Party discussed issues related to the activities and cooperation of the two parties, and exchanged views on the main issues of the international workers' movement.

The two parties believe that it is necessary to continue to struggle to defend the purity of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, and to continue to creatively develop the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism.

The two parties believe that the ideological unity of Marxist-Leninist parties requires an uncompromising struggle against revisionism, and also requires a resolute struggle against various manifestations of dogmatism and sectarianism. The two parties are determined to continue to strengthen cooperation, exchange experience, and expand contacts with each other in the future.
