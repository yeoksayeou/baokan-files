Conquering the Heat of "Sanfu Days"
    Zhao Qi
    Today marks the beginning of the first "Fu". This year's "Sanfu Days" begin today. "Sanfu Days" are the hottest period of weather in most parts of China. "Coldest during 'Sanjiu', hottest during 'Zhongfu'". The "Zhongfu" mentioned in the proverb refers to the middle ten days of the "Sanfu Days".

              Busy with Farm Work During Summer Heat
    The hotter the Fu days, the busier the agricultural activities, which is a characteristic of agricultural production in most of our regions. In the double-cropping rice areas of the south, harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice are mostly done during this period. "Late rice cannot be delayed past autumn. If delayed, nothing will be harvested." The seedlings of double-cropping late rice must be transplanted during the hottest "Zhongfu" period to ensure a good harvest.
    Although the situation in the north is not as tense as in the south, there is still a lot of farm work to be done. In the north, there is more rainfall and higher temperatures during the summer heat, and weeds grow fastest. Therefore, in most parts of the north, intensive cultivation and weeding must be carried out during these hottest twenty to thirty days to prevent weeds from overwhelming the crops.
    It is also because there is more rainfall in the northern regions during this period that many rivers will experience the summer flood season. The summer flood season is also called the major flood season. Larger riverside areas, in addition to busy farm work during this period, must also prepare to participate in the fight against the summer flood.
    Getting more "Fu bolls" is a key to increasing cotton production. "Fu bolls" are cotton bolls that form during "Chu Fu" (first Fu) and "Er Fu" (second Fu). Regardless of whether it is in the south or the north, in order to get more "Fu bolls", cotton field management must be intensified during the summer heat.
    "Radishes in the first Fu, vegetables in the second Fu." Northern farmers must also sow autumn vegetables such as Chinese cabbage, radishes, turnips, and mustard greens during the "summer heat" period.
    Many pastoral areas have a special farm task during this period, which is to cut "Fu grass". "Fu grass" has high nutritional value, and one pound of "Fu grass" is equivalent to two pounds of "autumn grass". In pastoral areas, cutting "Fu grass" is something that cannot be relaxed. "Summer grass is a winter treasure," is the experience of the herdsmen.
    Most Important is Heatstroke Prevention and Healthcare
    Although working in the fields is different from working in a workshop, some measures can be taken to prevent heatstroke and ensure healthcare.
    Reasonably arranging labor time is an important aspect of heatstroke prevention measures in agricultural production. Going to work early, finishing work late, and extending the lunch break are good ways to prevent heat. This not only does not delay farm work but also reduces exposure to the scorching sun.
    Shielding from direct sunlight is also an important heatstroke prevention measure. For some relatively fixed farm tasks, such as drawing water, a small shed can be erected. Wearing a bamboo hat, straw hat, or white headscarf when going to the fields can also protect the head from direct sunlight.
    Establishing temporary drinking water stations under trees and in shady places in the fields, and building some temporary shelters from local materials, can provide a good place for people working in the fields to rest.
    Working in the heat causes a lot of sweating. After sweating a lot, the body will experience water loss and salt deficiency. Therefore, when going to the fields in hot weather, it is necessary to carry some light salt water as a beverage. When conditions permit, some summer medicine can also be brought and distributed for consumption.
    Properly arranging meals and sleep for commune members may not be considered heatstroke prevention measures, but they are closely related to heatstroke prevention and healthcare. The reason is simple: eating well and sleeping well allows people's physical strength to recover faster, and their ability to resist heat will be correspondingly enhanced.

    战胜炎热的“三伏天”
    赵起
    今日初伏。今年的“三伏天”由今天开始了。“三伏天”是我国各地天气最炎热的时期。“冷在‘三九’，热在‘中伏’”。谚语中所说的“中伏”，就是“三伏天”的中间十天。
              暑伏期间农活多
    伏天越热，农事活动越忙，这是我们绝大部分地区农业生产的一个特点。南方双季稻区抢收早稻、抢插晚稻，大部分是在这个期间。“晚稻不过秋。过秋九不收”，双季晚稻的秧苗，必须在最热的“中伏”里插完，才有好的收成。
    北方地区虽然没有南方地区那样紧张，但是要作的农活也是很多的。北方地区在暑伏期雨水多、气温高，杂草生长最快。因此，北方大部分地区，在这最热的二、三十天里要突击中耕锄草，不叫杂草欺住庄稼。
    也正因为北部地区这个时期雨水多，这里的许多河流都将出现伏汛。伏汛也叫大汛。较大的沿河地区，在这期间除了繁忙的农活以外，还要准备参加防范伏汛的斗争。
    多座“伏桃”是增产棉花的一个关键。“伏桃”就是在“初伏”“二伏”结出来的棉桃。不论南方、北方，为了争取多结“伏桃”，就必须抓紧暑伏期间的棉田管理。
    “头伏萝卜，二伏菜”。北方农民还要在“暑伏”期播种大白菜、萝卜、蔓菁和芥菜等秋菜。
    许多牧区在这个期间有一项特殊的农活，这就是打“伏草”。“伏草”养分高，一斤“伏草”能顶二斤“秋草”。在牧区，打“伏草”是不能放松的事。“伏天草，冬天宝”，牧民们都有这样的体会。
    防暑保健最重要
    在田间干活尽管和车间劳动不同，但是也可以采取一些措施来防暑保健。
    合理支配劳动时间，是农业生产防暑措施的重要项目。早出工、晚收工、中午延长休息时间，是防暑热的一个好办法。这样既不耽误农活，又能减少骄阳的炙晒。
    遮蔽炎日的直接照射，也是防暑的一项重要措施。有些比较固定的农活，像车水等，可以架上一个小棚；下田戴斗笠、草帽或扎白头巾，也能防护头部不受烈日的直晒。
    在田间利用树下和荫凉的地方设立临时饮水站，就地取材搭一些临时性凉棚，都可以使田间劳动的人们得到很好的休息场所。
    天热干活出汗多。大量出汗以后，会造成身体失水和缺盐现象。因此炎热天气下田，要携带一些淡盐水作饮料。条件许可时，还可以带些暑药，分发服用。
    妥善安排社员的吃饭、睡觉，虽然不算什么防暑措施，但是这些都和防暑保健有着密切的连系。道理很简单，吃好睡好，人们的体力就能恢复得较快，抵抗暑热的能力就相应地增强。
