Cooperation Among Nationalities Turns Soil into Gold
Ongniud Banner Achieves Great Production Development

(Reported by our newspaper) A conscious, comprehensive, and banner-wide communist great collaboration is being widely implemented in the rural pastoral areas of Ongniud Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Since this spring, herdsmen from various pastoral people's communes throughout the banner have supported the agricultural people's communes within the banner with large numbers of strong cattle and high-quality sheep manure. The agricultural people's communes have also sent a group of Han farmers with rich agricultural production experience and skilled carpenters, bricklayers, and sewing technicians to pastoral areas to help establish feed and vegetable bases, brick factories, and sewing factories, as well as rush-produce and repair oxcarts and other pastoral production tools, and transported many excellent grain and vegetable seeds to the pastoral areas. The joint dairy processing plant built by the Mongolian and Han people of the banner is about to go into production. All agricultural people's communes in the banner assisted the Baiyinhancha pastoral commune with more than 10,000 laborers to build the Shaole River dam. An agreement has been reached and is being implemented whereby the Baiyinhancha pastoral commune will improve livestock and allocate grasslands for the agricultural people's communes. Recently, Mongolian members of the Baiyinhancha People's Commune often drove two, three, four, or five head of cattle, pulling many manure carts, heading towards the agricultural areas to support the Han members. Bao Zhe (Mongolian), the secretary of the commune's Party committee, said: "The cooperation and support of Baiyinhancha's herdsmen with the Han people in other areas has become a completely conscious action." During last year's spring plowing, the Hongqi People's Commune in Shanzui Township lacked draught animals and fertilizer. The Baiyinhancha herdsmen took the initiative to send 45 head of draft animals and a large amount of sheep manure to help the Han members complete the spring sowing task. The Hongqi People's Commune, understanding that the Baiyinhancha herdsmen did not know how to farm and lacked seeds and oil, sent experienced farmers to help establish feed and vegetable bases and provided a large number of seeds and oil. The herdsmen said gratefully: "We will never forget the help from our Han brothers." During last year's autumn plowing, the seven Sumu in the pastoral area learned that the agricultural area lacked draught animals, so they supported more than 400 cattle, helping five agricultural townships plow 1.08 million mu of land, increasing the deep plowing area of the banner from the past 60%-70% to over 90%.

Since the establishment of this new cooperative relationship among the people of all ethnic groups in the banner, the economic landscape has rapidly changed. In 1958, the banner's grain output increased by 43% compared to 1957, and the net increase in livestock was 7.18% (exceeding the historical peak level). In particular, the pastoral areas, which have always lacked agricultural production technology, have not only expanded the planting area of ​​grain and vegetables to an unprecedented extent with the help of Han farmers, but also greatly increased the yield per unit area. Last year, the average yield per mu of feed base in pastoral areas increased from dozens of jin in the past to more than 280 jin. Vegetables are now basically self-sufficient, and in many places, various sideline productions such as rabbit breeding, pig raising, and chicken raising have been developed, enriching the economic content of the pastoral areas.

    各族协作土变金
    翁牛特旗生产大发展
    本报讯　一个自觉的、全面的、全旗性的共产主义大协作，正在内蒙古自治区翁牛特旗农村牧区广泛实行。今春以来，全旗各牧区人民公社的牧民们已把大批健壮的耕牛和质量很好的羊粪支援旗内各农村人民公社生产；各农村人民公社也派出一批富有农业生产经验的汉族农民和技术水平较高的木匠及制砖、缝纫等技术工人到牧区去帮助建立饲料、蔬菜基地，砖厂、缝纫厂以及赶制与修理牛车等牧业生产工具，并把很多优良的粮食蔬菜种籽运给牧区。这个旗蒙汉人民协作建成的乳品联合加工厂，就要投入生产了。全旗各农区人民公社援助白音汗牧区公社一万多民工，修筑少勒河拦河坝，白音汗牧区人民公社也为各农村人民公社改良牲畜和拨划草场的协议已经达成并执行。最近，白音汗人民公社的蒙古族社员们，常常赶着二、三头或四、五头役牛，拉着许多粪肥，向农业区进发，支援汉族社员。这个公社的党委书记包哲（蒙古族）说：白音汗的牧民同其他地区汉民的协作和支援，完全成了自觉的行动。去年春耕时，山咀乡红旗人民公社的役畜不足，肥料缺乏，白音汗的牧民就主动送去四十五头耕畜和大批羊粪，帮助汉族社员们完成了春播任务。红旗人民公社根据白音汗的牧民不会种地和缺乏种籽、油料的情况，派出有经验的农民帮助建立饲料和蔬菜基地，并给了大批种籽和油料。牧民感激地说：“汉族兄弟的帮助，我们永远忘不了。”去年秋翻时，牧区七个苏木了解到农区役畜不足，就支援了四百多头牛，帮助五个农业乡翻地一百零八万亩，使全旗深翻地面积由过去的60％—70％，提高到90％以上。
    自从全旗各族人民这种新的协作关系建立起来以后，经济面貌迅速改观。1958年全旗粮食比1957年增长43％，牲畜纯增7.18％（超过历史最高水平）。特别是一向缺乏农业生产技术的牧区，在汉族农民的帮助下，不仅粮食蔬菜的种植面积空前扩大，而且，单位面积产量也有很大提高，去年牧区饲料基地每亩平均产量由过去的几十斤，提高到二百八十多斤，蔬菜已能基本自给，并且，在许多地方还发展了养兔、养猪、养鸡等多种副业生产，丰富了牧区经济内容。
