Title: Starting from the Play-within-a-Play

Comrade Feng Zi and Lan Guang:

After watching "The Last Act," I must first congratulate you. "The Last Act" is very appealing to the audience, and I am, of course, one of the attracted viewers. I have seen some plays where, after one or two acts, the audience is still confused about what is happening on stage. Only after the play ends do they figure out the story. While watching, the audience is thinking, watching, and discussing simultaneously. Sometimes, I read the script before watching the play, so I don't get too lost. However, we can't possibly read every script, and we also experience the troubles of the general audience. This made me wonder, "What is the problem?" Starting anything is difficult, and writing a play is probably most difficult in the first act. After watching "The Last Act," this old question kept popping up in my mind.

The dramatic action of the gunshot at the opening immediately "suppressed" the entire audience. In just one second, the attention of thousands of viewers, those chatting, eating candy, dozing off, and those just stepping out of the office with a document in hand... all focused on the stage, on the star illuminated by the spotlight. The "mother," with her two braids and ragged peasant clothing, cried out, "My son!" and cursed the puppet soldiers. When she grabbed the puppet soldier, about to fight him, the two seemed to discover something. The peasant old lady trembled and cried out, "Xingwang's father..." During this scene, the other characters on stage seemed oblivious, each doing their own thing. Only after the son, who had been pretending to be dead on the ground, got up did the audience suddenly realize and start discussing, "It's a rehearsal!" "It's backstage!"... The audience was quickly drawn into the prescribed situation, and this natural entry into the scene must be attributed to the author's skillful arrangement of the play-within-a-play detail. This detail is cleverly and powerfully used at the beginning of the play; moreover, this play-within-a-play, in terms of its plot, foreshadows the entire play's conflict, the struggle between the underground party-led drama troupe and the Kuomintang propaganda machine, and the central event that runs through the entire play. It also reflects the artistic direction of the drama troupe. Through this rehearsal, the main characters and their relationships are very clearly introduced. I thought again, this detail arrangement is definitely not a casual addition. You are a playwright, you understand playwriting, you are familiar with and understand the audience, you feel responsible for reducing the audience's confusion, you would never let the audience watch half a play and still be clueless. Maybe this answer is only half right, I have to think further...

As the play progressed, a comrade familiar with Drama Team Two sitting next to me asked, "Who is Ying Fang based on?" Yes, who is he based on? The news of Drama Team Two's successful retreat from Beiping spread like good news in the Kuomintang-controlled areas before liberation. I only met the comrades of Team Two after liberation, but their reputation had preceded them for a long time. It is difficult to pinpoint who is who. Ying Fang has shadows of A, and also shadows of B. The image of the comrades of the entire drama troupe led by Ying Fang in "The Last Act" is that of Team Two, and also of other teams; it is of the drama troupe, and also of the comrades in other progressive professional theater groups in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Of course, the author will have shadows of characters when writing, and not just one; but these shadows must undergo a process of chemical combination and refinement when they appear in the author's pen. Therefore, Ying Fang is like many of our familiar friends, but not so specifically like a certain comrade from Team Two, and the reason should lie here. Not only Ying Fang, but also Sister Da, Old Ma, Su Li, Bai Ling, Jiang Xia... and so on, are all like this. Speaking of the negative characters, such as Shi Ren and Director Hu, anyone who worked in the drama teams in the Kuomintang-controlled areas for a period of time would feel a sense of "déjà vu"!

Although your play centers on the retreat of Team Two, it is clear that it aims to reflect the cultural struggle led by the Party through this central event, and to reflect the historical fact of the cultural front using the art form of drama to promote resistance against Japan and national salvation while fighting against the traitorous Kuomintang reactionaries. To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the drama movement, you wrote this play, on the one hand, to commemorate the past suffering years, and more importantly, through the struggle actions of this group of intellectual youths, to give some inspiration and education to today's youth living in a beautiful and happy life. Judging from the audience's reaction, your intention can be said to have been quite fully and successfully achieved. The audience's reaction is not just the opening play-within-a-play, I will not give any more examples here. The success of a play does not depend on what kind of theme it has, the audience comes to watch the "play"! But where does the play come from? Thinking of this, a "flash of inspiration" suddenly came. The previous question that has not been completely answered may now be handed in! I think the reason why you can create character images such as Ying Fang is that you have life experience! You lived in the drama troupe for so many years, you are one of those young warriors who "fought hard in a corner of the front and fought stubbornly for ten years." You have writing experience, but without those ten years of life, you could not have created these characters like Ying Fang, you could not have written such a play. Those who have lived in drama troupes understand "play" better than the average person, so you designed such a play-within-a-play at the beginning of the play, and a gunshot immediately brought the audience into the prescribed situation. It seems that skill is also rooted in the foundation of life. Leaving life, you may be able to play with skills, but skills divorced from life are false, and false skills are not art. People will not believe in such art, and will not be moved by it.

Talking about the play as a play, I also have some dissatisfaction. Are you too confined to the historical truth of Team Two's retreat, too accommodating to the historical details, so it is difficult for the audience to see from this play the combat role and political influence played by the Party-led drama troupe in the War of Resistance against Japan and after Japan's surrender. Speaking of the fact of retreat, in the circumstances at the time, "retreat" was a victory in strategy. This victory may be difficult for today's young audience to understand, so it requires reflecting the overall political climate at that time more deeply and broadly through this team's struggle - the victory of our War of Liberation and the trend of the Kuomintang's corruption and demise. In the second scene of the second act, Old Xu comes on stage with the Party's instructions, a brief few minutes of the scene, similar to an explanation, and also like a transition. The audience's impression is unlikely to be profound. The play of the two students and the play of Marie seem to have been revised and deleted. The writing power for the Kuomintang's unpopularity, the people's suffering, and the people's longing for liberation seems to be insufficient.

I've gone too far. I should report my impressions of watching the play to you.

The Youth Art Theater's performance of your "The Last Act" is almost entirely by young actors. Young people have a passion, and although they (and she) don't have that period of life experience, they still perform believably. Veteran actors such as Wang Ban play the most minor roles, such as the cook Old Li, to add color to the play. Among the actors, Wang Pei's Xiang Shi Ren is the most successful. He created a negative character without deliberately starting from the appearance, and this step was on the right track. Ying Fang is an underground party member with principles, courage to fight, and rich fighting experience, who can flexibly deal with any situation. If you don't deeply experience the character, it is easy to become glib. This role should be played by an actor with more fighting experience, not because he is the protagonist, but because it is not easy to create this character without a little life experience. The roles of Jiang Xia and Sister Da are relatively realistic. The director is successful, the play is tightly structured, the atmosphere is created just right, and there is artistic organizational power. The stage design is also good, which can highlight the play. For example, the scene in the first act, the door leading to the stage has a corridor, which is several steps higher than the dressing room. There are also more scenes in that area. This design meets the requirements of the play and enhances the expressive power of the play.

Some issues belong to performance techniques, such as the actors' reading of lines is not very ideal, some actors' tones are not very accurate, and some of the endings are not sent to the audience's ears. This certainly requires technical training, and perhaps at the same time a better understanding of the meaning of the lines. If the meaning is right, the tone will not be too wrong. They are all relatively young, and there may be more problems in this area. Because they are young, it is quick and easy to change. For this reason, I would like to mention it here.

I heard that you are going down to live in the countryside. We are waiting to read your new work!

Shake hands!

Feng Zi

### 从戏中戏说起

    从戏中戏说起
    凤子兰光同志：
    看了“最后一幕”，首先应该祝贺你，“最后一幕”非常吸引观众，当然我就是被吸引的观众之一。曾经看过一些戏，看了一两场，满台的人，观众却闹不清台上发生的是什么事。一直到散场，才把个故事捉摸出来。看的时候，观众是边想、边看、边议论。有时读了剧本才去看戏，因此还不至于弄不清线索。不过，我们也不可能有戏必读，一般观众的苦恼我们也身受过。也因此我就想：“这是什么问题呢？”万事开头难，写戏恐怕也是难在第一幕。看了“最后一幕”之后，脑子里不禁又翻腾起这个老问题。
    一开幕，富有戏剧性动作的那一声枪响，立即把全场观众“镇压”下来。只一秒钟，那正聊着天的，吃着糖的，打盹的，刚跨出办公室手里还拿着份文件瞧着的……上千的观众的注意力都集中在舞台上、聚光灯照着的角儿身上，那梳着两条小辫穿着破烂农民服装的“母亲”，哭喊着：“我的儿子”，怒骂着伪军，当她揪着伪军要拼命的时候，两人像发现了什么似的，这位农民老太太颤抖地哭喊着：“兴旺他爹……”这一场戏进行过程中，台上其他的角色好像没事人似的都各干各的。等装死躺在地下的儿子爬起来之后，观众这才恍然大悟地议论开了：“这是排戏呀！”“这是后台”！……观众很快的被带进了规定情景，这么自然的被带进规定情景，不得不归功于作者对于戏中戏这一细节安排手法之高。这一细节用在戏的开头是非常巧妙，有力；而且这一节戏中戏，就其情节来看，为全剧的矛盾，地下党领导的演剧队和国民党宣传机关的矛盾斗争，贯串全剧的中心事件作了伏笔，并且又体现了演剧队的艺术创造的方向。经过这一场排戏，几个主要角色及其关系非常清楚的介绍出来了。我又想，这一细节安排决不是随手拈来的，你是剧作家，你懂得编剧，你熟悉、了解观众，你会感到有这个责任，减除观众的苦恼，你决不会让观众看了半场戏还摸不着头脑，也许这个答案只对了一半，我还得再想下去……
    戏在进行中，隔坐一位熟悉演剧二队的同志问我：“应放写的谁呀？”是呀，写的谁呢？演剧二队胜利地从北平撤退这事，解放前喜讯般传播在国民党统治区。二队的同志我倒是解放以后才认识的，那可真是闻名已久了。要具体看出谁是谁可就难了，应放有甲的影子，也有乙的影子，“最后一幕”中以应放为首的全演剧队的同志们的形象是二队的，也是其他队的；是演剧队的，也是国民党统治区其他进步职业剧团里的同志们的形象。当然作者下笔时会有人物的影子，而且不只一个；但是这些影子出现在作者笔下时必然经过一个化合提炼的过程，所以应放像许多我们所熟知的友人，却并不那么具体的像二队某一个同志，其理应在此。不止应放，大姐、老马、苏力、白灵、蒋暇……等等人物莫不如此。就说反面人物吧，世仁、胡主任之流，曾在国民党统治区戏剧队伍里干过一个时期的，谁也会感到“似曾相识”吧！
    你这个戏虽然是以二队撤退为事件中心，显然是要通过这一中心事件反映党领导的文化斗争，反映文化战线上用话剧这一艺术形式宣传抗日救国同卖国的国民党反动派进行斗争的这一历史事实。为了纪念话剧运动五十年，你写这个戏，一则为了纪念已逝的苦难的年月，而更重要的是通过这一群知识青年的斗争行动，可以给生活在美好幸福的生活中的今天的青年们一些启发和教育。你的意图通过观众的反映来看，可说是相当完满而成功的达到了。观众的反映不只是开头那一场戏中戏，这里我就不再举例了。一个剧本的成功并不因为它有什么样的主题，观众是来看戏的，问题也就在这个“戏”字！可是戏从那儿来呢？想到这儿，忽然来了“灵感”，前边那个问题还没答完的，现在也许可以交卷了吧！我想你所以能创造出应放等等人物形象，就在于你有生活！你在演剧队生活了那么些年，你就是“在战线的一角艰苦地战斗过，并且顽强地战斗了十年”的这样一批青年战士中的一个。你有写作经验，可是如果没有那十年的生活，你不可能创造出应放等这些人物来，你不可能编这样一出戏。在戏剧团体生活过的是比一般人更懂得“戏”，所以你在戏一开幕就设计出这样一场戏中戏，一声枪响就立即把观众带进到规定情景中去。看来技巧也是根植在生活的基础上面的，离开生活，也许可以玩玩技巧，但是脱离生活的技巧是虚假的，虚假的技巧不是艺术，那样的艺术，人们不会信服，不会感动。
    就戏论戏，我也还有些不满足，你是不是过于拘限于二队撤退这一历史真实，过于迁就了这一历史细节，因此观众们很难从这个戏看出党领导的演剧队在抗日战争及日本投降后所起的战斗作用和政治影响。就说撤退这一事实吧，在当时情况下在策略上“撤退”就是胜利，这个胜利对今天青年观众来说恐怕不好理解，因此就要求通过这个队的这一斗争，较深较广地反映出当时的总的政治气候——我解放战争的胜利和国民党的腐朽灭亡的趋势，二幕二场老徐上场带上来党的指示，匆匆几分钟的戏，近似交代，也像过场，观众印象不可能深刻。两学生的戏和玛瑞的戏演出时似有所删改，对于国民党的不得人心，民不聊生和人民等待解放的心情笔力似感不足。
    扯的太远了，我应该向你汇报我看戏的印象。
    青年艺术剧院演出你的“最后一幕”几乎全是青年演员，青年人有股热劲，虽然他们（和她们）没有那一段生活，演来还都可信。老演员王斑等演最次要的角色，如炊事员老李，是为戏生色的。演员中王培的向世仁最为成功，创造反面人物而不故意从外形着手，这一步就走对了头。应放是一个有原则、敢于斗争、和富有斗争经验，能灵活应付任何情况的地下党员，如果不深入体验人物，就很可能流于油滑，这个角色应该找一个较有斗争生活的演员来演的，并不是因为他是主角，而是这个人物没有一点生活经历是不容易创造的。蒋暇和大姊两角色比较真实。导演是成功的，戏扣的紧，气氛制造的恰到好处，有艺术组织魄力。舞台设计也不错，能突出表现戏。如第一幕的景，通向舞台的门有一个走廊，比化装间高几个台阶，那个区域的戏也比较多，这个设计符合了戏的要求，也为戏增强了表现力量。
    有些属于表演技术问题，如演员的读词不太理想，有些演员语气不很准确，有的尾音送不到观众耳里，这固然需要技术锻炼，恐怕同时也要更好的体会台词的涵义。语义对了，语气也就错不了多少。他们都较年青，这方面问题可能多一些，唯其年青，改起来既快又容易。为此，愿意在此顺提一笔。
    听说你将要下去生活，我们等待读你的新作！
    握手！
                      凤子
