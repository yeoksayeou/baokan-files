    Reflect Teachers' Lives More
    Recently, the People's Daily published articles such as "I Love Teaching." I think such articles are very good, and they are very inspiring for every teacher, especially young teachers who have just started working, as well as young students who are about to embark on teaching positions. Articles of this kind have been published very rarely in the past. I hope that more articles reflecting the lives of teachers will be published in the future to encourage and educate comrades on the vast cultural and educational front.

    多反映教师的生活
    最近人民日报刊登了“我热爱教师工作”等文章。我觉得这样的文章很好，对每个教师特别是参加工作不久的青年教师，以及即将走向教师岗位的青年学生都有很大的启发。像这一类的文章过去登得很少。今后希望多发表些反映教师生活的文章，让广大文教战线上的同志受到鼓舞和教育。
