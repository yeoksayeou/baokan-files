The Yellow River Makes its First Contribution to the People of Eastern Henan
By Our Reporter Jun Qian

Irrigation with Yellow River water leads to a bumper wheat harvest

The land on the eastern Henan plain is mostly sandy, barren, saline-alkali, and prone to waterlogging, so crop yields have always been low. However, this year, the counties irrigated their wheat with Yellow River water for the first time and generally achieved a bumper harvest.

According to preliminary understanding: The wheat in the Yellow River irrigation area generally increased production by 30 to 50 jin per mu, and some increased by one or two times. The nine counties and cities of Ningling, Minquan, Lankao, Kaifeng, Qixian, Yucheng, Suixian, Shangqiu, and Shangqiu City, which used more Yellow River water to irrigate wheat, have a total of 5,150,000 mu of wheat, with an average yield per mu increasing by 18% compared with last year. Lankao County, located in the old course of the Yellow River, with the most serious sandy barren and saline-alkali land, known as the "Kingdom of Sand," has more than 470,000 mu of wheat, with an average yield per mu increasing by nearly 25% compared with last year. In the northern suburbs of Kaifeng City, Dabeigang harvested more than 50,000 jin of wheat from more than 800 mu last year, but this year, 250 mu of wheat reached more than 50,000 jin after being threshed twice, with an average yield per mu increasing by more than two times. Of particular note is the 2,747 mu of wheat in the sandy-alkali land of the Guozhuang Production Brigade of the Nanzhang People's Commune in Lankao County, which surprisingly created a record of an average yield of 109 jin per mu. The land in this team is so severely affected by saline-alkali that seedlings often cannot take root. Before liberation, wheat was never planted; after liberation, some wheat was planted, but the yield was still not high. This year, because the Yellow River water washed away the salt and alkali on the ground and suppressed the salt and alkali underground, the wheat yield increased by nearly one time compared with last year. This brigade, which used to rely on government relief, sold surplus grain to the state for the first time this year.

        A Painful History

The eastern Henan plain is located on the famous "tofu waist" of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. In the past, the Yellow River breached its banks several times, and the floodwaters roared and rushed for thousands of miles, sweeping away vast tracts of fertile land in this area and flowing south into the Huai River. The old course of the Yellow River after the diversion in 1855 and the diversion during the Hongzhi period of the Ming Dynasty is still clearly visible within the territory of Lankao and Minquan counties. In 1938, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique breached the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou, causing profound disasters to this area. Each time the Yellow River breached its banks and changed its course in this area, it left behind a large amount of fine sand, turning good land into low-lying, easily waterlogged areas, and making the soil saline-alkali.

Therefore, seedlings cannot take root after sowing, and even if they emerge, they are often drowned by salt and alkali; or when the wind rises, the topsoil dries up and the seedlings are parched to death; even if there is a harvest, the yield is pitifully low. Before liberation, coupled with the exploitation and oppression of the reactionary rulers, the people were even poorer. The following folk song is a portrayal of the experiences of the masses in this area: "Disasters abound on both banks of the Yellow River, either floods or droughts; the five grains do not grow in the fields, either flying sand or alkali."

These places are prone to both waterlogging and drought, and droughts are more frequent and more severe. When there is a drought, many pits and ponds have no water at all; the pits and ponds that do not dry up also cannot be used to irrigate the land because the water contains too much salt and alkali. It is rare to dig a well on sandy barren land; even if it is dug, the water volume is small. After liberation, Qianyuanzi in Minquan County once dug a well twenty-five zhang deep to reach the spring, but the daily water volume could only irrigate half a mu of land. Kaifeng Prefecture also dug a well 112 meters deep in Beiguan, north of Minquan County, but it could only produce 9 tons of water per hour. Production in the eastern Henan area has always been very low because it is subject to the water damage of the Yellow River.

      Transform the Yellow River, Dig out the Root of Disaster

Since the Yellow River has been governed by the people, Party organizations at all levels in the eastern Henan plain have led the broad masses of people to build dikes and defend against floods, and have achieved great victories in safely passing the major flood season of the Yellow River year after year. At the same time, they are also actively carrying out the great project of fundamentally controlling the water damage of the Yellow River and developing the water conservancy of the Yellow River. From the winter of 1955 to 1956, a Yellow River siltation and irrigation canal gate was built on the south bank of the Yellow River in Huayuankou, a suburb of Zhengzhou City. In July 1957, the Heigangkou Yellow River siltation and irrigation canal gate in Kaifeng County was also completed and released water, with good results. From the winter of 1957 to last year, during the nationwide upsurge of water conservancy construction, canal gates and siphons for Yellow River siltation and irrigation were vigorously built on both banks of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. In addition to the Gangli Dongfeng Canal in the suburbs of Zhengzhou City, which can divert 280 cubic meters of flow per second, there is also the "People's Great Leap Forward Canal," the largest Yellow River diversion project built in Sanyizhai, Lankao County, Henan Province. It can divert 520 to more than 1,000 cubic meters of Yellow River water per second, irrigating 20 million mu of farmland in eastern Henan and southwestern Shandong; it can also silt up and improve the soil, develop navigation to the Huai River and the Grand Canal, use the head of the canal to generate electricity, and raise fish in the reservoirs along the canal. Such a huge water conservancy project would normally take three or four years to complete, but the 700,000 migrant workers from Henan and Shandong provinces who participated in the construction of this project, with soaring enthusiasm, completed the water diversion gate, the main canal, and the branch canal in just over four months. From last winter to this spring, a large number of canals and ridges below the branch canals have been built. During the wheat growing season, the Sanyizhai People's Great Leap Forward Canal diverted nearly 1 billion cubic meters of water from the Yellow River.

Diverting the Yellow River for Irrigation Achieves Three Things at Once

The first irrigation of farmland in eastern Henan with Yellow River water has greatly increased the yield of wheat in eastern Henan.

Why can Yellow River irrigation increase wheat yield? Under the measures of deep plowing and close planting, the masses in the Yellow River irrigation area unanimously believe that: the Yellow River has a large amount of water and irrigates more thoroughly than well water; the temperature of the Yellow River water is higher than that of well water, which is convenient for wheat seedlings to absorb, and can also increase the ground temperature, which is conducive to wheat resisting spring frost; the Yellow River water contains a large amount of silt, and the silt contains a large amount of fertilizer. Chemical tests have proved that: on average, each ton of Yellow River water contains 0.8 to 1.5 kg of nitrogen, 1.5 kg of phosphate fertilizer, and 20 kg of potash fertilizer. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are all the main nutrients for crops, so the masses call Yellow River irrigation "applying dragon manure" to wheat. Yellow River irrigation actually achieves the triple effect of watering, fertilizing, and improving the soil.

This year, some places compared the effects of watering Yellow River water and watering well water under the same other conditions, and found that the difference between the two in terms of increasing production was very large. Houzhuang Production Team of the May 1st Brigade in the suburbs of Shangqiu City, 4 mu of wheat irrigated by Yellow River water by gravity, produced 716 jin per mu; Lengkengzhuang Production Team, 6 mu of wheat irrigated with well water, produced 563 jin per mu; the yield difference between the two was more than 27%. At the same time, Yellow River gravity irrigation also saved a lot of manpower and animal power.

After Yellow River irrigation, the land is often moist, not only is it easy for seedlings to take root, but the quicksand can no longer fly in the wind, damaging and crushing the wheat seedlings; the salt and alkali in the low-lying areas are either washed away by the Yellow River water or suppressed; the siltation improves the soil, and the fertility of the land increases; with the channels, drainage is easy, and the groundwater level in the low-lying areas is lowered. These favorable factors enabled the saline-alkali land that could not be sown with wheat to be sown with wheat this year; and the land with very low yields in the past has achieved a bumper harvest this year. In the past, Lankao County had to reduce the harvest area by a lot every year due to the damage of wind and sand and salt and alkali, and the area of wheat lost last year was more than 26,000 mu; this year, with the first Yellow River irrigation, the area of loss was reduced to 6,149 mu. In the suburbs of Kaifeng City, about 50,000 mu of wheat were sown in previous years, but about 10,000 mu were always lost due to wind and sand and salt and alkali, and this year there has been basically no loss.

The outstanding achievements of the first year of Yellow River irrigation in eastern Henan and the bumper wheat harvest have encouraged people's confidence and enthusiasm in further utilizing Yellow River water. Now, various places are establishing or improving the management institutions for Yellow River irrigation, strengthening the management and maintenance of channels and buildings, rushing to complete the final work of small channels for diverting water into the fields, leveling the land and building ridges, and striving for a greater harvest in the autumn.

    黄河为豫东人民首次立功

    引黄灌溉，小麦大丰收
    豫东平原土地多沙荒、盐碱，低洼易涝，农作物产量一向不高。但是今年各县第一次引黄河的水浇灌小麦，普遍获得丰收。
    据初步了解：引黄灌区的小麦，一般增产三十到五十斤，有的增产一、两倍。引用黄河水浇麦较多的宁陵、民权、兰考、开封、杞县、虞城、睢县、商丘、商丘市等九个县市，共有小麦五百一十五万亩，平均亩产量比去年增加18％。处在黄河故道，沙荒、盐碱最严重，素有“沙土国”之称的兰考县，四十七万多亩小麦，平均亩产量比去年增加近25％。开封市郊区北关大北岗去年八百多亩小麦收五万多斤，今年二百五十亩小麦，打了两遍就达到五万多斤，平均亩产增长两倍多。特别引人注意的是兰考县南彰人民公社郭庄生产大队沙碱地的二千七百四十七亩小麦，居然创造了平均亩产一百零九斤的纪录。这个队的土地，盐碱严重得经常捉不住苗。解放前，就没有种过麦子；解放后，种了些麦子，但产量仍是不高。今年因为用黄河水把地面上的盐碱冲洗了，把地下的盐碱压下去，小麦产量就比去年增产将近一倍。这个过去经常依靠政府救济的大队，今年第一次向国家出卖余粮。
        痛苦的历史
    豫东平原处在黄河下游有名的“豆腐腰”上。过去，黄河几次溃决，洪水奔腾咆哮，一泄千里，横扫了这个地区的万顷良田，南下注入淮河。1855年黄河改道和明朝弘治年间改道后的故道，现在还很明显地摆在兰考和民权等县境内。1938年，蒋介石反动集团在花园口扒开黄河堤，给这个地区造成了深重的灾害。黄河每次在这个地区溃决、改道，都要留下大量的细沙，把好地冲成低洼易涝区，使土壤盐碱化。
    因此，播种后捉不住苗，出了苗也常被盐碱浸死；或者一起风，地皮一干，就把苗儿涸死；就是能收获的，产量也低得可怜。解放前，再加上反动统治者的压榨剥削，人民就更加贫苦了。下面的歌谣，便是这个地区群众遭遇的写照：“黄河两岸多灾难，不是黄泛就是旱；田里五谷不成长，不是飞沙就生碱”。
    这些地方易涝又易旱，旱灾更多更严重。旱了的时候，好多坑塘滴水皆无；不涸竭的坑塘，也因水里含盐碱过多，不能用来浇地。在沙荒地上打井，很少能打成；纵然打成了，水量不多。解放后，民权县前园子曾打井下泉二十五丈深，每天水量只能浇半亩地。开封专区还曾在民权县城北关打了一眼一百一十二米深的机井，一小时也只能出水九吨。豫东地区的生产一直是很低的，就是因为受到黄河的水害。
      改造黄河，挖掉祸根
    自从黄河归人民治理以来，豫东平原各级党组织领导广大人民，大修堤坝，防御洪水，取得了连年安渡黄河大汛期的伟大胜利。与此同时，又积极进行根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的伟大工程。1955年冬到1956年，在郑州市郊区花园口黄河南岸建成了引黄淤灌渠闸。1957年7月，开封县黑岗口引黄淤灌渠闸也建成放水，效果都很好。1957年冬到去年全国水利建设高潮中，黄河下游两岸风起云涌大搞引黄淤灌溉的渠闸和建设虹吸管。大型渠闸除了可以引水二百八十秒立方米流量的郑州市郊区岗李东风渠外，还有在河南省兰考县三义寨兴建的最大的引黄工程“人民跃进渠”。它可以引用黄河水五百二十到一千多秒立方米的流量，灌溉豫东和鲁西南二千万亩农田；并可放淤改良土壤，发展通向淮河和大运河的航运，利用渠道的落差发电，在沿渠道的水库里养鱼。像这样巨型的水利工程，要按常规需要三、四年才能完成，可是参加这项工程施工的河南和山东两省七十万民工，以冲天的干劲，只用四个多月，就完成了引水闸、总干渠、干渠。从去冬到今春，又做了大量干渠以下的各级渠道和畦田。在小麦生长期间，三义寨人民跃进渠从黄河引出近十亿立方米的水量。
    引黄灌溉一举三得
    黄河水首次灌溉豫东的农田，使豫东的小麦得到了大增产。
    引黄灌溉为什么能提高小麦产量呢？在深翻土地、密植等措施下，引黄灌区的群众一致认为：黄河水量大，比用井水浇得透；黄河水的温度比井水高，便于麦苗吸收，又能提高地温，利于小麦抗御春季霜冻；黄河水里含有大量泥沙，泥沙里含有大量肥料。化验证明：平均每吨黄河水含氮素零点八到一点五公斤，磷肥一点五公斤，钾肥二十公斤。氮、磷、钾都是农作物的主要养分，因而群众把引黄灌溉叫做给小麦“上龙粪”。引黄灌溉实际上起到了浇水、施肥、改良土壤，一举三得的作用。
    今年有些地方在其他条件相同的情况下，把浇黄河水和浇井水作了比较，发现两者在增产的影响上差别很大。商丘市郊区五一大队侯庄生产队，用黄河水自流灌溉的四亩小麦，亩产七百一十六斤；冷坑庄生产队用井水浇的六亩小麦，亩产五百六十三斤；两者的产量相差27％多。同时，引黄自流灌溉还节省了大量人力和畜力。
    引黄灌溉后，土地经常是湿润的，不但容易捉苗，流沙也无法再随风飞扬，打坏和压死麦苗；低洼地的盐碱，不是被黄河水冲洗走，便是被压下去了；落淤改良了土壤，土地的肥力增加了；有了渠道，排水容易，降低了低洼地的地下水位。这些有利因素，使不能播种小麦的盐碱地，今年播种了小麦；过去产量很低的，今年得到了大丰收。兰考县过去因为风沙和盐碱的破坏，每年的收获面积总要比播种面积缩减很多，去年损失的小麦面积有二万六千多亩；今年首次引黄灌溉，损失面积就减少到六千一百四十九亩。开封市郊区，往年播种小麦五万亩左右，因风沙和盐碱总要损失一万亩左右，今年已经基本上没有损失。
    豫东第一年引黄灌溉，取得小麦大丰收的卓越成就，鼓舞了人们进一步利用黄河水的信心和积极性。现在各地正在建立或健全引黄灌溉的管理机构，加强对渠道和建筑物的管理养护，赶做引水入田的小渠道尾工，平整土地和修筑畦田，争取秋季更大的丰收。
