Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 1st – News: After a long struggle by the Japanese people, the Japanese Supreme Court today approved the release on bail of the last three innocent defendants imprisoned in the "Matsukawa Incident." Thus, all seventeen defendants who were unjustly found "guilty" in the "Matsukawa Incident" have now been released on bail.

The three defendants released on bail today are Noboru Suzuki, Saburo Sugiura, and Noboru Honda. They had all been unjustly sentenced to death. Today, Noboru Suzuki and Saburo Sugiura left the prison where they had been incarcerated for nine years and ten months. Noboru Honda had previously been receiving medical treatment in a hospital outside the prison.

The "Matsukawa Incident" was a train derailment incident near Matsukawa Station in Fukushima Prefecture on August 17, 1949, fabricated by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to persecute the Japanese working class. The Japanese reactionary government falsely claimed that this was a "violent act" committed by the Communist Party, and subsequently arrested twenty trade union cadres and workers. Although the Japanese courts held two hundred and four trials and found no evidence to prove the defendants
"guilty," they still sentenced seventeen innocent defendants to death, life imprisonment, and long prison terms.

This act of persecution by the Japanese reactionary government was met with resolute opposition from the broad masses of the Japanese people. For more than nine years, the Japanese people have been waging an unyielding struggle, demanding the unconditional release of all innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." Fair-minded public opinion and kind people in various countries around the world have given strong support to the just struggle of the Japanese people.

Under these circumstances, the Japanese courts were forced to gradually approve the release of all defendants on bail.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 2nd – News: All the defendants in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident" issued a statement yesterday, expressing heartfelt gratitude to people from all walks of life in Japan for their efforts in securing their release on bail. At the same time, they firmly stated that for the sake of truth and to defend democracy, rights, and peace, they will continue the struggle to the end.

Okabayashi Tatsuo, the representative of the "Matsukawa Incident" defense lawyers group, gave a speech demanding that the Supreme Court swiftly abolish the second instance judgments that sentenced most of the defendants to death, life imprisonment, and long prison terms, and declare all defendants not guilty. Okabayashi finally called on the Japanese people to continue to strengthen their struggle and strive to force the Supreme Court to acquit all defendants.

Yoshio Shiga, a member of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party, published a statement in the "Akahata" newspaper today, pointing out that although all defendants have been released, they have not yet finally obtained a verdict of not guilty, and the Japanese Public Prosecutor's Office has not abandoned its conspiracy to persecute the defendants. Under these circumstances, the Japanese people should continue to fight to achieve a verdict of not guilty for all defendants.

    日本“松川事件”被告全部出狱
    全体被告声明将继续斗争到底
    志贺义雄号召继续奋斗争取判决全体被告无罪
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：经过日本人民长期的斗争，日本最高裁判所今天已经批准“松川事件”的最后三名被监禁的无辜被告保释出狱。至此，“松川事件”的十七名被判“有罪”的被告已经全部保释出狱。
    今天被保释出狱的三名被告是铃木信、杉浦三郎、本田升。他们都曾经无辜地被判处死刑。今天，铃木信和杉浦三郎离开了被监禁了九年零十个月的监狱，本田升事先已经在狱外医院治病。
    “松川事件”是美日反动派在1949年8月17日为了迫害日本工人阶级而在福岛县松川车站附近制造的一个火车出轨事件。日本反动政府捏造说这是共产党制造的“暴行”，先后逮捕了二十名工会干部和工人。尽管日本的法院举行了二百零四次审讯也没有找到证明被告
  “有罪”的证据，但是它们仍然对其中十七名无辜被告判处了死刑、无期徒刑和长期徒刑。
    日本反动政府的这种迫害行为遭到了日本广大人民的坚决反对。九年多来，日本人民一直在进行着不屈不挠的斗争，要求无罪释放“松川事件”全体无辜被告。世界各国公正舆论和善良的人们对日本人民的正义斗争给予了有力的支持。
    在这种情况下，日本法院才被迫陆续批准全体被告保释出狱。
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本“松川事件”全体被告在昨天发表声明，对日本各界人民对保释他们出狱所作的努力表示衷心的感谢，同时坚决表示，为了真理和维护民主、权利与和平，他们将继续斗争到底。
    “松川事件”辩护律师团代表冈林辰雄发表谈话，要求最高裁判所尽速把判处大部分被告死刑、无期徒刑和长期徒刑的第二审判决作废，宣判全体被告无罪。冈林最后呼吁日本人民继续加强斗争，争取迫使最高裁判所判决全体被告无罪。
    日本共产党中央干部会委员志贺义雄今天在“赤旗报”上发表谈话指出，全体被告虽然获释，但他们还没有最后地取得无罪的判决，日本检察厅还没有放弃迫害被告的阴谋。在这种情况下，日本人民应该为争取判决全体被告无罪而继续奋斗。
