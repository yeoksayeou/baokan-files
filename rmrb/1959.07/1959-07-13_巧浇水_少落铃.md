    Skillful Watering Reduces Boll Dropping
    National Model Worker Qu Yaoli
    From the time cotton is sown until the budding stage, as long as there is no serious drought and the cotton seedlings do not stop growing, it is generally not advisable to water them.
    After the Grain in Ear solar term, cotton seedlings begin to bud and bloom, and the need for water increases day by day. If the weather is somewhat dry, watering is necessary. However, the first watering should not be too heavy. If too much water is applied, the internodes will lengthen, and the number of fruiting branches will decrease. If it rains after watering, it will not only cause the cotton seedlings to grow vigorously, but also make the buds and bolls prone to falling off.
    Watering during the budding period should be based on meeting the water needs of the cotton seedlings' growth. A method of watering every other furrow should be adopted, and the watering should be done gently. During the full bloom period, when the lower part has not yet set cotton bolls, the watering should be controlled by mastering "three observations, one listening, five waterings, and four non-waterings." "Three observations" are: First, observe the weather. If it is overcast and it is about to rain, do not water. If the southeast wind does not stop, and the mountains are capped with clouds, this is a sign of rain, and watering should also be avoided. Second, observe the soil moisture. If the base moisture is sufficient and the soil surface is moist, and there is dew in the morning, and the humidity is high, watering can also be temporarily suspended. Third, observe the growth of the cotton plants. If the cotton seedlings are growing rapidly, and the new leaves are tender and green, and the cotton leaves do not droop at noon, watering can also be temporarily suspended. "One listening" is that you should listen to the weather forecast every day, and if there is rain, you should not water. "Five waterings" are: If the soil is dry and lacks moisture, water should be applied; if the cotton seedlings grow very slowly, and the cotton leaves droop at noon and cannot return to their original state in time, water should be applied; during the dog days, the daytime is very hot, and it is cool in the morning, and there is no rain for the time being, water should be applied; after the rain, the weather suddenly clears up, the ground heat rises, and the temperature is particularly high, a light watering should be applied in the afternoon and evening; if the weather forecast predicts no rain, water should be applied.
    When watering cotton, if the weather is dry, after watering three or four times in a row, it is necessary to stop watering once, and then resume watering. Why is this? The reason is very simple. If the watering is done too frequently, the newly formed flower buds and young bolls that are less than seven days old will be shed due to excessive watering and water saturation, which will cause the small bolls and upper flower buds to fall off. Stopping watering once allows it to breathe, and then watering again will make the newly formed buds, bolls, and flowers less prone to falling off.

    巧浇水　少落铃
    全国劳模　曲耀离
    棉花自播种后直到现蕾前，只要没有严重的旱象，棉苗不停止生长，一般的都不宜浇水。
    过了芒种节，棉苗就要开始现蕾开花，这就一天比一天需要的水分多啦；如果天气有些旱，就需要浇水。但是头水不要浇的多了，如果浇的水过多，节间长的就长啦，果枝就会减少；倘若遇上了浇后下雨，不仅会引起棉苗猛长，蕾铃也就容易脱落。
    现蕾期浇水，以满足棉苗生长所需的水分为标准。应采取隔一沟浇一沟的办法，轻轻的浇就行啦。在盛花期，下部还没有坐下棉桃，浇水时要掌握好三观、一收听、五浇、四不浇。“三观”是：一、观察天气，如果阴云密布，天将要下雨，就不敢浇水；若是东南风不倒，山上带着云彩帽，这是下雨的先兆，也不能浇。二、观察墒情，如果底墒足地皮湿润，早上有露水，潮气很大，也可以暂时不浇。三、观察棉株生长情况，如棉苗生长很快，新叶又发嫩绿，中午棉叶又没有下垂趋向，也可以暂时不浇。一收听是，每天要收听气象预报，如果有雨就不能浇。“五浇”是：土壤干燥缺墒要浇；棉苗生长很慢，中午棉叶下垂，不能及时恢复原状的要浇；伏里天，白天很热，早上发凉，暂时没雨，要浇；雨后天气猛晴、地面热气上蒸、气温又特别高，应在下午和晚上轻轻的浇一水；气象预报没雨，要浇。
    在给棉花浇水时，若是天气干旱，挨住浇过三、四水以后，需要停一水，以后再接上浇。这是为什么呢？道理很简单。如果浇水赶得紧了，上部新生的花蕾和不满七天的幼铃，就会因浇水过紧，水分过饱而把小桃和上部的花蕾催掉。停一水，让它缓一缓气再浇水，新结的蕾、铃、花就不易脱落啦。
