Lamenting the Ancient Battlefield
	——Random Notes from Bulgaria, Part Four

	The car sped through the endless fields of roses. We stopped along the way to pick cherries by the roadside to quench our thirst; they tasted exceptionally delicious. We then resumed our journey southwest along the Balkan Mountains. At the foot of the Shipka Pass, we saw the church commemorating Russia's victory over Turkey, its golden dome radiant and dazzling. It was dusk, and the car spiraled upwards. The forests were dense, and the iron pylons and cables crisscrossed among the bizarre peaks and rocks, adding to the scenery. The wind sent clouds flying, and mountain rain blurred the view. We finally reached the world-renowned Balkan mountain range.
	At night, Comrade Jia recounted the battle’s history. In August 1877, at this Shipka Pass, a small number of Bulgarian militia, yearning for the restoration of their country, who had crossed the Danube River from Romania, fought heroically together with Russian volunteer soldiers against the Turkish occupation army, which outnumbered them several times. At that time, the Russian army had surrounded a Turkish unit north of the Balkan Mountains, and the occupation army south of the mountains had to pass through this mountain pass to provide support. The anti-Turkish insurgents occupied the high ground to intercept them. However, due to the overwhelming disparity in numbers, they ran out of ammunition, and despite many casualties, they could not change the state of being semi-encircled. Then a Russian General, Stoletov, stood on Eagle's Nest peak, raised his arm and shouted, ordering his men to hurl the corpses of their comrades and stones and gunstocks downwards, fighting valiantly and finally defeating the enemy. At the same time, another Russian army fought fiercely against the Turkish army at the southern foot of Shipka, annihilating a large number of enemies. As a result of this battle, the Turkish army retreated eastward, and by September 1878, Bulgaria was completely liberated from 482 years of enslavement under Turkish rule, while Russia sacrificed more than 200,000 outstanding sons and daughters.
	To commemorate this war of liberation, over four hundred monuments and churches were built in cities and villages throughout Bulgaria, or cannons used in the battle were displayed in parks. For example, a bronze statue of the Russian Tsar Alexander II was erected in the capital, Sofia, and cities, villages, roads, or mountain peaks were named after many Russian generals, such as Shipka, which has now been renamed Stoletov Peak.
	The Russo-Turkish War laid the foundation for the close ties between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria. In addition, on September 9, 1944, the Soviet Red Army defeated the fascist forces of Hitler's Germany in Bulgaria, which people called the second liberation. As a result, the Soviet Union enjoys an extremely high position in the hearts of the Bulgarian people.
	The next morning, we ascended the peak, more than 1,440 meters above sea level, amidst howling cold winds. The wind was bone-chilling and strong, making it difficult to stand. We saw the 34-meter-high stone monument, with a 12-meter-long roaring bronze lion on the front, and the words "Here rose the freedom of Bulgaria" engraved below the lion. Beside the monument were two cannons pointing to the sky, the original weapons used to kill the enemy. About 300 steps behind the monument, the rocky mountain was steep and majestic, with a hundred-meter cliff below, a strategically important location, the famous Eagle's Nest. One could imagine the intensity of the battle at that time.
	Lamenting this famous battlefield of the nineteenth century, I couldn't help but feel emotional. I wrote eight poems in the seven-character quatrain form to express my unforgettable sentiments:
	Lamenting the ancient battlefield,
	The old mountain is steep and the night is vast;
	Leaning on the railing to discuss the rise and fall of events,
	Clouds roll and winds howl across a thousand-foot ridge.

	When the Turkish demon king invaded and occupied,
	The Bulgarian people suffered long nights of sighing;
	Heroes' regrets buried loyal bones,
	The Russian king's army raised the flag of justice.

	The Bulgarian army fought bravely with high shouts of killing,
	The white horse general was heroic;
	Return our freedom, donate hot blood,
	The demon soldiers broke their courage and threw their knives at night.

	The morning wind of June is piercingly cold,
	The strange peak rises straight into the blue sky;
	The towering stone tablet stands in the sky,
	The roaring lion is passed down for centuries.

	The bronze cannon points proudly to the sky,
	The mighty general shouts in the wilderness,
	The earth shakes and the mountains tremble at Shipka,
	Common hatred for the enemy overflows our chests.

	Swords, stones, and knives are honed by the terrain,
	The hero's name is praised for ten thousand years at Eagle's Nest;
	Looking down from above to destroy the powerful enemy,
	The stubborn bandits did not dare to cross.

	Brave soldiers fought hard in the white clouds,
	When the bullets ran out, they still shook their iron arms;
	Heroes sacrificed their lives to fight,
	Corpses were raised high and thrown all over the mountain!

	The grass is green at the foot of the Balkan Mountains,
	The golden roof shines brightly;
	Two hundred thousand brave soldiers died in the righteous war,
	May the green mountains forever comfort the loyal souls!

    吊古战场
    ——保加利亚散记之四
    凌鹤
    车在一望无际的玫瑰地中驰驱。途中停车采道旁樱桃解渴，味极鲜美。旋复沿巴尔干山南西行，至石?卡山峰下，便见纪念俄罗斯战胜土耳其的教堂，金顶辉煌，光彩脱目。时正黄昏，汽车盘旋登山。树林深密，奇峰怪石间见铁架电缆纵横，点缀成趣。风送云飞，山雨迷蒙，我们终于到世界驰名的巴尔干山岭了。
    夜间，贾同志为我叙述当年战绩。时在1877年8月，在这石?卡，从罗马尼亚南渡多瑙河的为数不多的保加利亚的心怀复国的民兵，和俄国的义军战士，联合与超过几倍之众的土耳其占领军英勇作战。其时，俄军已将巴尔干山北的土耳其某部包围，巴尔干山南部的占领军须经这山垇驰援，抗土义军即占领高地截击。可是众寡悬殊，他们打完炮弹了，死伤很多，仍不能改变被半包围的状态，于是一位俄罗斯将军斯朵列陀夫，在鹰窝山上，振臂大呼，命令以战友的尸骸和石木枪托下掷，英勇作战，终于将敌人击溃。同时，另一路俄军在石?卡南麓与土军恶战，歼灭了大量敌人。由于这一战役，土军败退东遁，至1878年9月，保加利亚在土耳其的四百八十二年的奴役统治下全部解放，而俄罗斯则牺牲了二十多万优秀子弟。
    为了纪念这自由之战，全保城市和农村，共建了四百多座纪念碑、教堂等，或在公园陈列当时作战的大炮；例如首都索非亚树立了俄皇亚力山大第二的铜像，并以俄将多人的名字命名城市、乡村、马路或山峰，如石?卡现在就改名斯朵列陀夫山峰了。
    俄、土之战奠定了苏联和保加利亚的血肉关系，加之1944年9月9日，苏联红军又击败了保加利亚境内的希特勒德国的法西斯军，人们称为第二次解放，于是苏联在保国人民的心目中，更有极为崇高的地位了。
    次日清晨，我们在寒风呼啸中登上了拔海一千四百四十多公尺的高峰。风冷刺骨，而且很强烈，使人站立不住。但见三十四公尺高的石碑，正面有十二公尺长的怒吼着的铜狮，狮下刻着“这里升起了保加利亚的自由”词句。碑旁有两尊仰天的大炮，是当年杀敌原物。碑后侧约三百步处，石山陡削巍峨，下望则悬崖百丈，形势险要，便是有名的鹰窝。当时战斗之烈可以想见了。
    凭吊这十九世纪的名战场，不禁情怀起伏，爰书七绝八首，以志不忘。凭吊当年古战场，老山陡削夜苍茫；倚楼共话兴亡事，云卷风嚎千尺岗。土域魔王侵占时，保民长夜苦嘘唏，英雄遗恨埋忠骨，俄国王师举义旗。保军奋战杀声高，白马将军气势豪，还我自由捐热血，妖兵胆破夜抛刀。六月晨风彻骨寒，奇峰直上碧云天；巍峨石碣穹空立，怒吼雄狮百世传。仰天铜炮自昂扬，威武将军啸大荒，地动山摇石?卡，同仇敌忾溢胸膛。剑石刀峰地势磋，英名万载颂鹰窝；居高临下摧强敌，顽贼三军不敢过。健儿苦战白云霄，弹尽还将铁臂摇；壮士捐躯犹作战，尸骸高举满山投！巴尔干麓草青青，金屋辉煌耀眼明；廿万健儿义战死，千山常绿慰忠魂！（附图片）
