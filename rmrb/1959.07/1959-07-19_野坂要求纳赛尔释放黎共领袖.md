Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: According to today's "Akahata" report, Nosaka Sanzo, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, wrote to the President of the United Arab Republic, Nasser, and the Syrian Regional Minister of Interior, Sarraj, on the 16th, demanding the immediate release of the Lebanese Communist leader, Khlou. Khlou was arrested by the UAR authorities in Damascus on June 25th.

In his letter, Nosaka said that Khlou has been a brave fighter who has persisted in the struggle for the cause of Arab national liberation for more than thirty years. The illegal arrest and torture of such a fighter is intolerable to all democrats in the world who are fighting against imperialism and for national liberation and peace.

Nosaka demanded that the UAR government immediately stop the torture threatening Khlou's life and immediately release Khlou.

    野坂要求纳赛尔释放黎共领袖
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党主席野坂参三在16日写信给阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔和叙利亚地区内政部长萨拉杰，要求立即释放黎巴嫩共产党领袖赫卢。赫卢是6月25日在大马士革被阿联当局逮捕的。
    野坂在信中说，赫卢是三十多年来为阿拉伯民族解放事业坚持斗争的勇敢战士。非法逮捕这样一位战士并对他加以拷问，这是反对帝国主义和争取民族解放以及争取和平而斗争的世界上一切民主主义者所不能容忍的事情。
    野坂要求阿联政府立即停止威胁赫卢生命的拷问，并且立即释放赫卢。
