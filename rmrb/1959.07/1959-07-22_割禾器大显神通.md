In the Laowuzao work group of the Xinlong production team of the Tanzishan commune in Hengnan, on a field called "Dragon Head Sign," new-style farm tools are showing their great power. Two people are using chicken-coop style rapid reaping machines to harvest rice, and four people are following behind to bind the rice. One of the two members reaping the rice is Zhou Dushu, who was an expert in rapid reaping machines last year; the other is Xie Shuhuan, a twenty-year-old young woman. Last year at this time, she was still a student, and after graduating, she joined agricultural production. When the Party Committee decided to continue promoting the chicken-coop style rapid reaping machine this year to increase work efficiency, Little Xie immediately responded to the call. Look, today she's just like a skilled machine operator! "Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh" it keeps sounding, reaping really fast and well! The two of them are reaping back and forth in the field, like shuttles. They look so relaxed and at ease, and in the places where they have reaped, there are very few grains of rice left on the ground, and very few un-reaped rice ears; they are reaping so cleanly.

Those binding the rice certainly won't fall behind. Team cadre Zhou Duxing and members Zhou Da and the other four, are chasing hard, sweating profusely, with their clothes sticking tightly to their bodies. They're using all their strength, but the rapid reaping machine is still far ahead of them. So, they asked Xie Yingfeng, an expert in binding rice, to help. Five people chased hard. But Little Xie and the others are even more unwilling to show weakness. By the time they finished reaping the entire field, the five of them had only finished binding four-fifths of it. After reaping and binding, they calculated that this field produced 20% more than the bumper year of last year, and the efficiency of reaping also increased by 100%.

    割禾器大显神通
    在衡南潭子山公社新隆生产队老屋皂作业组的一丘叫龙头牌的田里，新式农具在大显神通。二个人用鸡笼式快速割禾器在割禾，四个人在跟着扮禾。割禾的二个社员，一个是周笃树，他去年就是快速割禾器的能手；另一个是二十岁的女青年谢树环。去年这时她还是个学生，毕业后就参加了农业生产。当党委会决定今年继续推广鸡笼街式快速割禾器来提高工效时，小谢立即响应号召。看，今天她真像个熟练的机器驾驶员哩。“呼呼呼”不断地响了下去，割得真是又快又好！他们两人在田里一来一往地割着，犹如穿梭一般。看去他们是那么轻松自如，在割过禾的地方，地上很少掉有谷粒，也很少有漏割的禾穗，割得是那么干干净净。
    扮禾的那肯落后，队干部周笃信、社员周达等四人，紧赶猛追，累得满头是汗，衣服顺着汗水，紧贴在身上。他们使了最大的劲，快速割禾器还是远远走在他们前面，于是，又请扮禾能手谢英凤来帮忙。五人猛追，猛赶。可是小谢他们更不示弱，当他们把全田的禾割完时，他们五人还只打完五分之四。割完扮完后，他们一算，这丘田比丰收的去年增产二成，割禾的工效也提高了一倍。
