    Art Group
    In the Songling Machinery Factory in Shenyang, one can see murals, Leap Forward Palaces, martial arts competition platforms, high-yield platforms, gifts for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China platforms, galleries, and propaganda boards everywhere. It is truly colorful and dazzling. Those who don't know better would think that these are the work of art professionals. In fact, they are all created by active art enthusiasts from various workshops.
    These active art enthusiasts often use their spare time to wield their brushes and express the new people and new things in the Great Leap Forward and the miracles of innovation in beautiful and humorous pictures. They also regularly publish "Mass Literature and Art" featuring art works. Each issue of this publication can publish more than 50 art works. Each publication is like holding an art exhibition, and the workers rush to watch it. There is a worker in the factory who painstakingly researched and created an automated plate cutting machine, which greatly improved production efficiency and product quality. During the research, because he was illiterate and couldn't draw, he used sorghum stalks and papier-mâché to compile physical object drawings, and finally successfully trial-produced it. The art activists vividly depicted this incident. After the workers saw it, they said: People who are illiterate can engage in invention and creation, why can't we?

    美术小组
    在沈阳松陵机械厂，到处都可以看到壁画、跃进宫、比武台、高产台、建国十周年献礼台、画廊、宣传板，真是五光十色，琳琅满目。不知道的，还以为那是出自美术工作者之手，其实，都是各车间的美术活动积极分子搞出来的。
    这些美术活动积极分子经常利用业余时间挥舞画笔把大跃进中的新人新事，革新奇迹，用美丽和风趣的图画表现出来。他们还定期出版“群众文艺”，刊登美术作品。这个园地每期都可刊出美术作品五十多幅，每次出刊就像举办美术展览会似的，工人们争先恐后围绕来看。厂里有位工人，刻苦钻研创造了一台自动化切板机，大大提高了生产效率和产品质量。在研究的时候，因为他不认识字，不会画图，就用高粱秆和马粪纸编制实物图样，最后终于试制成功。美术积极分子把这件事情生动地画了出来。工人看过后说：人家是文盲都能搞发明创造，我们为什么不能呢？
