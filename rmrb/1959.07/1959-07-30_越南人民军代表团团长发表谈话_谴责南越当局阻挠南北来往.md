Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 28th. Senior Colonel Ha Van Lau, Head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, today gave a statement to the Vietnam News Agency reporter regarding the statement issued by the South Vietnamese authorities on July 17th. This statement by the South Vietnamese authorities addressed the relocation of residents between North and South Vietnam and the issue of the two sides "exchanging five hundred families each."

Ha Van Lau first pointed out that this statement is filled with distorted facts and fabricated figures. It shows that in the face of the rising tide of the Vietnamese people's demands for unification and opposition to the crimes of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, the South Vietnamese authorities are feeling panicked and are attempting to divert public opinion.

Ha Van Lau exposed the "facts" fabricated and distorted in this statement one by one. He pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities said that during the three hundred days of regroupment at the beginning of the restoration of peace in Vietnam, "more than 100,000 North Vietnamese residents could not relocate to South Vietnam." However, the fact is exactly the opposite. At that time, the South Vietnamese authorities used troops and other means to threaten, deceive, and force tens of thousands of people to move south, while the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam helped those who requested to move south, believing that they would eventually understand that the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's forced relocation was not for the "benefit of the people." Over the years, the miserable situation of the relocated people has made them recognize the true face of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique even more clearly.

Ha Van Lau then said that the South Vietnamese authorities say they are concerned about the relocation of residents between North and South Vietnam, but why didn't they allow the International Commission's Mobile Team 110 to go to Thu Dau Mot in 1955 to investigate the South Vietnamese authorities' persecution of residents who requested to move north? In October 1955, why didn't they dare to participate in the meeting convened by the International Commission to discuss the issue of relocation between the North and South? The South Vietnamese authorities must answer these questions.

Ha Van Lau also pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities said that many South Vietnamese families wrote letters to the International Commission requesting that their family members regrouped in North Vietnam return to South Vietnam. But in fact, these "letters" were fabricated by the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, and even the International Commission considered these "letters" to be invalid.

Ha Van Lau then refuted the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities' slanderous argument that "North Vietnam refused to exchange five hundred families on both sides near the 17th parallel." Ha Van Lau said, "This method of distorting the facts has reached an extremely shameless level." He said that in reality, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had explained its views on the so-called "exchange of five hundred families" proposed by the South Vietnamese authorities, believing that the issue of free movement of people between the two sides is the urgent wish and demand of all Vietnamese people, and the two sides can resolve it through consultation. However, the South Vietnamese authorities have not yet responded to this request made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Ha Van Lau also condemned the South Vietnamese authorities' crimes of refusing to restore normal relations between the North and South and refusing to unify the motherland through consultation over the years.

### 越南人民军代表团团长发表谈话  谴责南越当局阻挠南北来往

    越南人民军代表团团长发表谈话
    谴责南越当局阻挠南北来往
    新华社河内28日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校今天就南越当局7月17日发表的声明对越南通讯社记者发表谈话。南越当局这项声明谈到了越南北、南两方居民的迁居和两方“互相交换五百个家庭”的问题。
    何文楼首先指出，这项声明充斥着歪曲事实的论调和捏造出来的数字。它表明，在越南全国人民要求统一和反对美吴集团罪行的浪潮面前，南越当局正在感到惊慌，并且企图转移舆论视听。
    何文楼逐一揭穿了这个声明中所捏造和歪曲的“事实”。他指出，南越当局说，在越南和平恢复初期双方集结的三百天的时间中，“有十多万北越居民不能迁居到南越来”。可是事实完全相反，南越当局当时用军队和其他手段威胁、欺骗、强迫成万人南迁，而越南民主共和国政府帮助要求南迁的人南迁，并且相信他们终会明白美吴集团强迫南迁并不是为了“人民的利益”。几年来，南迁人民所处的悲惨境遇，使得他们更加认清了美吴集团的真面目。
    何文楼接着说，南越当局说他们关心北、南两方居民的迁居问题，可是，1955年，他们为什么不让国际委员会第一一○流动小组到土龙木去调查关于南越当局迫害要求北迁的居民的事件呢？1955年10月，他们又为什么不敢参加国际委员会召集的关于北、南双方讨论迁居问题的会议呢？南越当局必须回答这些问题。
    何文楼还指出，南越当局说有许多南越家庭写信给国际委员会要求集结在北越的家属返回南越。但是事实上，这些“信”是吴庭艳当局捏造的，连国际委员会也认为这些“信”是没有效力的。
    何文楼接着驳斥了吴庭艳当局所说的什么“北越拒绝交换靠近十七度纬线两边的五百个家庭”的污蔑论调。何文楼说，“这种歪曲事实的手段达到极其无耻的地步。”他说，实际上，越南民主共和国政府方面曾经就南越当局提出所谓
  “交换五百个家庭”的问题说明了自己的观点，认为两方人民自由来往的问题是全体越南人民迫切的愿望和要求，双方当局可以通过协商来解决。可是，南越当局至今仍未答复越南民主共和国提出的这个要求。
    何文楼还谴责了南越当局几年来拒绝恢复北、南两地的正常关系，拒绝通过协商来统一祖国的罪行。
