    “We Must Take Back What the Flood Has Stolen!”
    Long Live "Take Back!"
     Liu Bing
    The people of Guangdong have won their fight against the flood!
    The victors will never stop there. People are announcing to the unruly nature: We must take back what has been stolen!
    Take back! How loud and decisive, how much determination and strength it contains, and how much confidence it shows! Please weigh the significance of this sentence. Nearly six million mu of farmland, 100,000 mu of fish ponds, 200,000 houses, more than 28,000 projects… swept away by the flood, how much has been taken? But we must take it back, we must take it back, and without delay, we will do it this year.
    Throughout history, mankind has fought with nature for thousands of years, and what has been taken away is countless, but what has been taken back is even more. Since ancient times, the people have been advocates of "taking back," persistently adhering to the doctrine of "taking back." However, never before have we been able to issue such a loud and decisive order to nature: take back what was stolen within a time limit.
    We have already taken back a country from the reactionaries and built a new society. The people are now not only hardworking and brave but also possess indestructible full armaments. We have a Party that serves the people, a proletarian dictatorship, people's communes with unlimited vitality, an unprecedented era of the Great Leap Forward… What else dares to stop us!
    "Take back!" We have already taken back many things from nature, and we will take back even more. What has been taken away must be taken back, and we must also make new and greater demands on nature for what has not been taken away. Yes, there are "difficulties," but we have more methods and confidence, more weapons, and greater victory will surely come in the end. As long as we stretch out our divine arms, we will surely be able to take it back!
      Long Live "Take Back!"

    “洪水夺走的我们要拿回来！”
    “拿回来”万岁！

    广东人民抗洪斗争胜利了！
    胜利者决不就此罢休，人们向桀骜不驯的大自然宣布：被夺走了的东西，我们要拿回来！
    拿回来！多么响亮干脆，它包含有多么大的决心，多么大的力量，又表现了多么大的自信！请掂一掂这句话的分量吧。近六百万亩田禾，十万亩鱼塘，二十万间房屋，二万八千多处工程……被洪水一扫而光，被夺走的该有多少？但是，我们要拿回来，一定要拿回来，而且时不假贷，定在今年。
    有史以来，人类同大自然争夺了几千年，被夺走的已经难以数计了，但拿回来的却更多。人民，自古以来都是拿回来主义者，坚持不渝地奉行着拿回来主义。但是，过去却从来没有能像今天这样干脆响亮地向大自然下这样的命令：限期拿回来被夺走的东西。
    我们已经从反动派手里拿回来了一个国家，建设了一个新的社会。人民，如今不仅是勤劳和勇敢的，而且据有无坚不摧的全副武装。有为人民服务的党，有无产阶级专政的国家，有无限生命力的人民公社，有空前未遇的跃进时代……还有什么敢把我们阻挡！
    “拿回来”！我们已经向大自然拿回来了许多东西，我们还要拿回来更多的东西。被夺走了的要拿回来，未被夺走的也要向自然有新的更多的索取。是的，“有困难”，但我们有更多的办法和信心，有更多的武器，最后到来的必将是更大的胜利。只要我们伸开我们的神臂，我们就一定能拿回来！
      “拿回来”万岁！
