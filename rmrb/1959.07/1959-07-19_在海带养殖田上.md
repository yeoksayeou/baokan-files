　　Riding in a small boat, rowing on the Bohai Sea outside Yantai Port, you can see: the azure sea reflecting the clear sky; the calm sea surface, floating with bamboo tubes that have floated to the top – buoys, arranged in rows. What's beneath them? Kelp is growing! This is a marine aquaculture industry that has developed since liberation. In the vast area outside Yantai Port, under the Bohai Sea, there are currently about 1,700 mu of farming area, producing an estimated more than 102 million jin of kelp annually. What an astonishing number this is!

　　In the height of summer, with warm winds blowing, the calm sea surface ripples in layers, and the buoys sway with the waves. It is the kelp harvesting season. In the kelp fields, voices are loud, and boats gather like clouds. Hundreds of male and female aquaculture workers, divided into small boats, are carrying out harvesting work in a mighty and busy manner.

　　Kelp, this is the motherland's marine wealth. It is not only nutritious and can be used as a delicious vegetable, but also a good medicinal material that can prevent goiter, because it is rich in iodine.

　　Technician Song, who was in the same boat, told me: The Bohai coast is very suitable for kelp growth. The government has established specialized institutions and trained a large number of technical personnel to engage in this work. In a few years, the area of this kelp farming field will expand to tens of thousands of mu, or even hundreds of thousands of mu... He bent down and scooped up a rope of huge kelp from the water. This rope of kelp must weigh at least fifty jin, black and shiny, fat and strong, with the largest leaf probably a foot wide and nine feet long. It is truly lovable. Technician Song told me that the average yield per mu of kelp here is now more than 60,000 jin. This year, using multi-layer farming methods and selecting fine varieties, experimental fields with a yield of 5 million jin per mu are growing and will be harvested soon.

　　I looked up. At sea, many more aquaculture boats have been added at some point! At this moment, the sun is ending its day's work and is slowly setting in the west. The afterglow of the setting sun has painted the sea and sky with a layer of beautiful color. The laughter and songs of the aquaculture workers have been lingering in my ears. The flying seagulls sometimes skim over the water and then soar into the air in the blink of an eye. Countless aquaculture boats, loaded with kelp, slowly row towards the shore, with their gunwales almost touching the water.

    在海带养殖田上
    张相林
    乘一叶小舟，在烟台港外的渤海海面上划行，你可以看到：碧蓝的海水，倒映着明净的云天；平静的海面，漂浮着根根浮起的竹筒——浮标，排列成行。它的下面是什么？是海带在生长！这是在解放后发展起来的海洋养殖事业。在广阔的烟台港外，渤海下面，到目前为止已有一千七百亩左右的养殖面积，每年约计可产海带一亿零二千万斤以上，这是个多么惊人的数字啊！
    盛夏时节，暖风吹来，平静的海面荡起层层涟漪，浮标随波摇摆不停，正是海带收割的季节。海带田里，人声喧嚷，船集如云，几百名男女养殖工们，分乘小船，浩浩荡荡，紧张地进行收割工作。
    海带，这是祖国的海洋财富，它不只是富有营养，可以作味美的菜蔬。同时，又是良好的医药用材，可以防治胛状腺肿大，因为它含有丰富的碘质。
    同舟的宋技术员告诉我：渤海沿岸非常适宜于海带的生长。政府设立了专门的机构，培养了大批的技术人员，从事这项工作。几年以后，这片海带养殖田的面积将扩大到几万亩，甚至几十万亩……他俯身从水中捞起一绳偌大的海带。这一绳海带足足有五十斤吧，黑亮黑亮的，又肥又壮，最大的一张叶子，怕有一尺宽，九尺长，真是爱人得很。宋技术员告诉我，现在这里的海带每亩平均产量在六万斤以上。今年，采用多层养殖法，选择良种，每亩产五百万斤的试验田正在生长中，不久就可以收割。
    我抬起头来。海上，不知什么时候又增添了许多的养殖船！此时，太阳结束了他一天的劳动，正缓缓地向西方落去，落日的余辉，给海与天抹上了一层绮丽的光彩。养殖工们的欢笑声，歌声一直在耳边萦回缭绕。飞翔的海鸥，时而掠水而过，转眼间腾空而起。数不清的养殖船，满载海带缓缓地向岸边划去，船舷几乎贴近了水面。
