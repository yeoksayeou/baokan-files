Xinhua News Agency, 20th: A grand rally was solemnly held in the capital this morning by people from all walks of life to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords, resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

    In a "Message to the Vietnamese People" unanimously adopted at the meeting, the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam were warmly praised for their consistent efforts to strictly implement the Geneva Accords and achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and for their significant contributions to the cause of maintaining peace. The message also angrily condemned the crimes of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in violating the Geneva Accords, resolutely demanding that the United States immediately withdraw all military personnel from South Vietnam, dismantle all military bases, and immediately cease all acts of aggression in Indochina and other regions of Asia. The "Message to the Vietnamese People" reaffirmed that the Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland and will continue to work hard to ensure the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords in Indochina. In the common cause of building socialism and opposing aggression and defending peace, the Chinese people will always stand with the fraternal Vietnamese people.

    In the auditorium of the CPPCC, where today's meeting was held, huge and eye-catching slogans were hung: "Resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle for peaceful reunification!" "Long live the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people!" "Long live the great unity of the Asian and African people!" "Long live world peace!". At 8:30, Vietnamese Ambassador to China Tran Tu Binh and Phan Van Chuong, Vice Chairman of the Vietnamese Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, accompanied by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and others, ascended the flower-filled rostrum. At this moment, thunderous applause erupted in the venue, and more than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in the capital warmly paid their highest brotherly respect to the heroic Vietnamese people.

    Today's meeting was convened by the people of the capital in response to the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to hold "Vietnam Day." Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, said in his opening remarks that the holding of "Vietnam Day" once again demonstrates the unity of the Asian and African people and the common will of the people of all countries to oppose imperialist aggression.

    Liao Chengzhi pointed out that U.S. imperialism, in collusion with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, has repeatedly violated the Geneva Accords, continuously and illegally shipped large quantities of munitions into South Vietnam, and intensified the construction of military bases in various parts of South Vietnam, attempting to turn it into a base for the United States to re-launch aggressive wars in Indochina and Southeast Asia. Recently, the United States has even instigated Laos to re-ignite the civil war, and has continuously incited the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to encroach on the territory of the Kingdom of Cambodia and provoke the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These acts of aggression by the United States not only hinder the realization of the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords, but also seriously endanger the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the peace of Indochina and the world. He said that the U.S. intervention and aggression in Indochina has aroused great anger and widespread opposition from the people of Asian and African countries and the broad masses of people around the world. We firmly believe that the fraternal Vietnamese people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will achieve final victory with the support of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people.

    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting (full text on page 4). In his speech, he emphasized that the Vietnamese people's struggle to safeguard the Geneva Accords and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland has received and will always receive the firm support of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and countries around the world. As a participant in the Geneva Conference, our government and our people have consistently and solemnly upheld the Geneva Accords for the past five years and resolutely opposed the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to occupy and enslave Indochina and undermine peace in the Far East. In the future, our government and people will continue to fully support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords and the reunification of their motherland.

    The entire audience of more than 1,000 people welcomed Vietnamese Ambassador to China Tran Tu Binh with stormy and enthusiastic applause. Ambassador Tran Tu Binh's speech (full text on page 4) forcefully expressed the Vietnamese people's strong will to strive for the reunification of their motherland and severely condemned the criminal acts of U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in undermining the Geneva Accords and the reunification of Vietnam. The Ambassador emphasized that the Vietnamese people demand that the U.S. military delegation withdraw from South Vietnam, that the South Vietnamese authorities must abandon their policy of slavishly following U.S. imperialism, should immediately stop strengthening armaments and preparing for war, end the policy of persecution and retaliation against former resistance personnel and patriots, and guarantee their various freedoms and democratic rights. The South Vietnamese authorities must hold consultations with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to discuss the issue of holding free general elections throughout the country, thereby realizing the reunification of Vietnam. In order to create favorable conditions for the above matters, normal relations should be restored between the two regions. The Ambassador finally said that the just struggle of the Vietnamese people has won the sympathy and support of the world's peaceful democratic forces and the socialist camp, which is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people in their struggle to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The governments and people's organizations of various socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union have consistently and enthusiastically supported the position of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in fighting for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords. The Chinese people have always been concerned about and fully supported the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence and reunification. With the enthusiastic sympathy and support of the people all over the world, the Vietnamese people are more convinced that their struggle will surely be victorious.

    Sun Xiaocun, Vice President of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, Cai Tingkai, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Deng Chumin, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, Li Zhuchen, Deputy Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Qingyang, Vice President of the All-China Women's Federation, and Li Menghua, Vice President of the All-China Youth Federation, also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in undermining the Geneva Accords and expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

    In his speech, Sun Xiaocun emphasized that the Chinese people, whether in the past, present, or future, will always stand with the Vietnamese people and resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their country. Cai Tingkai solemnly warned the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique that if they do not immediately stop their criminal acts of undermining the Geneva Accords, they will inevitably be met with bloodshed in the face of the Chinese and Vietnamese people and all peace-loving people around the world. Deng Chumin pointed out that Vietnam is indivisible, and the Vietnamese people will never allow American robbers to set foot in South Vietnam. Peace-loving people all over the world oppose U.S. imperialism's military invasion of South Vietnam and demand that U.S. imperialism immediately withdraw its military advisors and military personnel from South Vietnam and dismantle its military bases. In his speech, Li Zhuchen stated that all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association, together with the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, resolutely demand that U.S. military personnel get out of South Vietnam. Li Jiebo emphasized that the Chinese workers, as signatories to the Geneva Accords, are actively supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to reunify their motherland. Chinese workers and people resolutely demand that U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam. Liu Qingyang said that the Chinese people and women will join hands with the Vietnamese people and the people of all countries in Indochina to resolutely strive for the implementation and maintenance of the Geneva Accords and to defend peace in Asia and the world. Li Menghua, on behalf of 130 million Chinese youth, declared that Chinese youth will always stand with the Vietnamese people and Vietnamese youth and fight shoulder to shoulder against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

    美国侵略势力必须滚出南越，日内瓦协议必须彻底履行！
    中国全力支持越南人民实现和平统一
    首都在“越南日”盛大集会，显示中越人民反对侵略保卫和平的坚定意志
    新华社20日讯　首都各界人民今天上午隆重举行盛大集会，纪念日内瓦协议签订五周年，坚决支持越南人民和平统一祖国的正义斗争。
    大会在一致通过的“致越南人民电”中，热烈赞扬越南人民和越南民主共和国政府一贯为严格履行日内瓦协议、实现越南的和平统一所作的努力，对维护和平事业作出的重大贡献，并且愤怒谴责美国和吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议的罪行，坚决要求美国立即从南越撤走一切军事人员，撤消一切军事基地，立即停止在印度支那和亚洲其它地区的一切侵略活动。“致越南人民电”代表中国人民重申：坚决支持越南人民为争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争，坚决为维护日内瓦协议在印度支那的彻底实施而继续努力。在建设社会主义的事业和反对侵略、保卫和平的共同斗争中，中国人民永远和兄弟的越南人民站在一起。
    在今天举行大会的政协礼堂里，悬挂着巨幅醒目的标语：“坚决支持越南人民争取和平统一的斗争！”“中越两国人民的兄弟友谊万岁！”“亚非人民大团结万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”。八时三十分，越南驻中国大使陈子平和越南亚非人民团结委员会副主席潘文章，由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若等陪同登上布满鲜花的主席台。这时，会场上掌声雷动，一千多名首都各界代表热烈地向英勇的越南人民致以崇高的兄弟般的敬意。
    今天的大会是首都人民响应亚非人民团结理事会关于举行“越南日”的号召而召开的。中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志在致开会词中说，“越南日”的举行，再一次地表现了亚非人民的团结一致和各国人民反对帝国主义侵略的共同意志。
    廖承志指出，美帝国主义勾结吴庭艳集团一再破坏日内瓦协议，不断向南越非法运入大量军火，加紧在南越各地修建军事基地，企图把它变成美国在印度支那和东南亚重新发动侵略战争的据点。最近，美国更指使老挝重新挑起内战，并且不断唆使吴庭艳集团侵犯柬埔寨王国的领土、向越南民主共和国进行挑衅。美国的这种侵略行动，不但阻挠了越南和平统一的实现，破坏了日内瓦协议的执行，而且严重地危害着越南民主共和国的安全及印度支那和世界的和平。他说，美国在印度支那的干涉和侵略引起了亚非各国人民和世界广大人民的极大愤怒和普遍的反对。我们深信，兄弟的越南人民和平统一祖国的斗争，在以苏联为首的社会主义各国和一切爱好和平的人民支持下，必将获得最后胜利。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在会上讲话（全文见第四版）。他在讲话中强调说，越南人民维护日内瓦协议、争取祖国和平统一的斗争已经得到而且还将永远得到亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的坚决支持。作为日内瓦会议的参加国，我国政府和我国人民五年来一贯严正地维护日内瓦协议，坚决反对美帝国主义侵占和奴役印度支那、破坏远东和平的阴谋。今后，我国政府和人民仍将全力支持越南人民为彻底实现日内瓦协议和争取祖国统一的正义斗争。
    全场一千多人以暴风雨般的热烈掌声，欢迎越南驻中国大使陈子平在会上讲话。陈子平大使的讲话（全文见第四版），有力地表达了越南人民争取祖国统一的坚强意志，严厉地谴责了美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议和越南统一的罪恶行为。大使强调指出，越南人民要求美国军事代表团撤出南越，南越当局必须放弃奴颜婢膝追随美帝国主义的政策，应立即停止加强军备和准备战争，结束对前抗战人员和爱国者采取迫害与报复政策，并保障他们的各种自由民主权利。南越当局必须和越南民主共和国政府举行协商，以利讨论在全国进行自由普选的问题，从而实现越南的统一。为给上述事项创造有利条件，两个地区应当恢复正常关系。大使最后说，越南人民的正义斗争已赢得了世界和平民主力量和社会主义阵营的同情和支持，这对越南人民在争取实现和平统一祖国的斗争中是一个巨大的鼓舞。以苏联为首的各个社会主义国家的政府和人民团体，一贯热情地支持越南民主共和国政府为彻底履行日内瓦协议而斗争的立场。中国人民一贯关心和全力支持越南人民为争取独立和统一的斗争。由于全世界人民热烈的同情和支持，越南人民更加深信自己的斗争事业一定会取得胜利。

    孙晓村在讲话中强调说，中国人民无论在过去、现在和将来，都永远和越南人民站在一起，坚决支持越南人民和平统一自己国家的正义斗争。蔡廷锴严正警告美国和吴庭艳集团说，他们如果不立即停止破坏日内瓦协议的罪恶行为，必然在中越人民和全世界爱好和平人民面前碰得头破血流。邓初民指出，越南是不可分割的，越南人民断不容许美国强盗在南越插脚。全世界的和平人民都反对美帝国主义对南越的军事侵入，要求美帝国主义立即从南越撤退军事顾问和军事人员，撤除军事基地。李烛尘在讲话中表示，中国民主建国会全体成员和全中国人民及全世界爱好和平的人民一道，坚决要求美国军事人员从南越滚出去。李颉伯强调说，作为日内瓦协议签字国的中国的工人，正积极地支援越南人民统一祖国的正义斗争。中国工人和人民坚决要求美帝国主义滚出南越去。刘清扬说，中国人民和妇女将同越南人民以及印度支那的各国人民一道，坚定地为贯彻和维护日内瓦协议的实现和保卫亚洲及世界和平而共同奋斗。李梦华代表一亿三千万中国青年宣称：中国青年将永远和越南人民和越南青年站在一起，为反对我们的共同敌人美帝国主义而并肩战斗。
