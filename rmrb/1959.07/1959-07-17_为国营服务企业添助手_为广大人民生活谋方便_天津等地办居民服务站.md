Supplementing State-Owned Service Enterprises, Seeking Convenience for the Broad Masses' Lives
Tianjin and Other Places Establish Resident Service Stations

(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 16th) Tianjin is expanding the business of state-owned service enterprises. At the same time, it is leading neighborhood residents to set up service stations, making up for the shortcomings of state-owned service enterprises and facilitating the masses.

At present, there are more than 7,000 neighborhood-resident-run living service units in the city, scattered all over the city, with more than 40,000 service personnel. These resident service units serve factories, enterprises, the vast number of workers, cadres, and neighborhood residents, starting from the needs of production and the needs of residents' lives. Service items include dismantling and washing, mending, serving patients, delivering coal, moving, repairing woodwork or electric lights, asking a doctor on someone's behalf, writing letters on someone's behalf, etc., with a total of sixty or seventy kinds. There are more than 900 public canteens organized by neighborhood residents throughout the city, solving the problem of meals for 85,000 people. There are more than 1,400 nurseries and kindergartens, taking in more than 63,000 children. Many service stations have established contacts with nearby factories, government offices, and schools, contracting for sewing, mending, and dismantling work clothes, socks, and other affairs, and picking up and delivering work to people's homes. The service methods are flexible and diverse, and very popular.

State-owned service enterprises impart technology to resident service stations, helping them improve business management. Some also cooperate with each other in business. For example, some simple jobs such as sewing and mending, sharpening knives and scissors, sawing pots and sawing bowls, are accepted by state-owned service stores on behalf of residents and turned over to resident service stations to do; more complex jobs such as washing and dyeing wool fabrics received by resident service stations are turned over to state-owned stores to do. In this way, residents can solve some of their daily life problems without having to travel far. Sometimes, resident service stations also process on behalf of state-owned stores.

Most of the people participating in service organizations are housewives, except for some elderly masons. All service units have a price list in accordance with the state's unified price standards, and based on the amount of materials used and the level of technology. The wages of service personnel are generally based on a fixed wage plus a bonus. Some households that used to rely on government relief can now support themselves after participating in service work.

(Our newspaper, Harbin, 16th) In Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, neighborhood residents have set up more than 300 miscellaneous household service stations (groups) of various forms. These service organizations sew, mend, dismantle, and wash clothing and bedding for employees, buy daily necessities on their behalf, pick up and drop off children, clean houses, and take care of patients and lying-in women, reducing their housework burden, inspiring their enthusiasm for production, and also supplementing the shortcomings of commercial service outlets.

Harbin City started this work from Chunhua Street in Daowai District. In early March of this year, this street carried out a pilot project of miscellaneous household services in the staff and workers' compound of the Songjiang Electric Machinery Factory. After mass discussion, it was decided to select people who are upright, hardworking, simple, have prestige among the masses, and are serious about doing things for everyone to be service personnel. These service personnel are all women with many children and elderly people who are old and weak. The labor remuneration is reasonably resolved by means of negotiation between the service personnel and the service recipients. In terms of service methods, a service manual has been established. Employees only need to record the required service items in the manual every day, and they can go to work with peace of mind; the service personnel will handle the items recorded in the manual properly. After the pilot project gained experience, many streets organized the masses to hold various forms of service organizations according to the different needs of the masses.

After the establishment of these mass service organizations, good results have been received. For example, Zhao Qiqing, a worker at the Songjiang Electric Machinery Factory, used to have to take three or four days off each month to do housework, and had to work very late after get off work every day; now with the service station, he doesn't have to spend so much time on miscellaneous housework. The service activities of the service station have also turned many old clothes into useful things, promoting the development of social conservation work. After the establishment of the service station, the employees were in a happy mood, and this was reflected in production, and there appeared a new atmosphere of three more (more women participating in labor, more people not absent, more output) and three less (less missed work, less illness, less lateness and early departure).

(Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 15th) The commercial departments of Chengdu City assist the street offices in organizing resident service stations as assistants to the state-owned service industry.

At present, there are nearly 300 resident living service stations established under the leadership of street offices throughout the city, with more than 4,000 service personnel participating and about 100 service items.

In order to help resident living service stations improve their business level, the city's commercial departments organize the barber industry to train apprentices for factories, government offices, and streets. Some famous restaurants send chefs to the service stations to teach cooking techniques. (Attached picture)

### 为国营服务企业添助手  为广大人民生活谋方便  天津等地办居民服务站

    为国营服务企业添助手  为广大人民生活谋方便
    天津等地办居民服务站
    本报天津16日电　天津市在扩大国营服务性企业业务的同时，领导街道居民举办服务站，弥补了国营服务性企业力量的不足，便利了群众。
    目前，全市街道居民办起的生活服务单位共有七千多个，星罗棋布遍及全市，服务人员有四万多人。这些居民服务单位从生产需要和居民的生活需要出发，为工厂、企业和广大工人、干部、街道居民服务。服务项目包括拆洗，缝补，服侍病人，送煤，搬家，修理木器或电灯，代请医生，代写书信等，共有六、七十种。全市街道居民组织的公共食堂有九百多个，解决了八万五千人的吃饭问题。托儿所、幼儿园一千四百多个，收托儿童六万三千多人。许多服务站和附近工厂、机关、学校建立联系，包揽缝补、拆洗工作服、衣袜等事务，而且上门取活送活。服务方式灵活多样，很受欢迎。
    国营服务性企业向居民服务站传授技术，帮助他们改善经营管理。有的在业务上还互相协作。例如，有些缝缝补补、磨刀磨剪子、锯锅锯碗等简单的活，国营服务性商店代为收下，转交居民服务站去做；居民服务站收到的洗染毛织品等比较复杂的活，就转交给国营店去做。这样，居民不用走远路就把日常的一些生活问题解决了。有时候，居民服务站还代国营店加工。
    参加服务组织的人员，除了部分老年泥瓦工人等以外，绝大部分是家庭妇女。各服务单位都按照国家统一的价格标准，和用料多少、技术高低等定有价目表。服务人员的工资，一般采取固定工资加奖励的办法。过去一些依靠政府救济的户，参加服务工作以后也能自给了。
    本报哈尔滨16日电　黑龙江省哈尔滨市街道居民办起了三百多个不同形式的零星家务服务站（组）。这些服务组织为职工们缝补拆洗服装被褥，代买生活用品，接送孩子，打扫屋子，照看病人、产妇等，减少了他们的家务负担，鼓舞了他们的生产热情，同时也补助了商业服务网点的不足。
    哈尔滨市开展这项工作是从道外区纯化街开始的。这条街今年3月上旬在松江电机制造厂的职工大院里，进行了零星家务服务的试点工作。经过群众讨论，确定选择为人正派、勤劳朴素、在群众中有威信，认真为大家办事的人做服务员。这些服务员都是多子女的妇女和年老体弱的老年人。劳动报酬，采取服务员与服务对象协商的办法，合理解决。在服务方法上，建立了服务手册，职工们每天只要将所要求的服务项目记在手册上，就可以安心去上班；服务员按着手册上记载的项目给办得妥妥贴贴。试点取得经验以后，许多街道都根据群众的不同需要，组织群众举办了各种形式的服务组织。
    这些群众性服务组织建立以后，收到了很好的效果。如松江电机制造厂工人赵淇清过去每月要请三、四天假搞家务事，每天下班后还要操劳到很晚；现在有了服务站，就不用为零星家务花那么多时间了。服务站的服务活动，还使许多旧衣物变成了有用之物，推进了社会节约工作的开展。建立服务站以后，职工们心情舒畅，反映在生产上，便出现了三多（参加劳动的妇女多、不缺勤的多、产量增多）、三少（误工的减少、有病的减少、迟到早退的减少）的新气象。
    据新华社成都15日电　成都市商业部门协助街道办事处组织居民服务站，作为国营服务行业的助手。
    目前，全市各街道办事处领导成立的居民生活服务站，将近三百多个，参加服务的人员有四千多人，服务项目有一百种左右。
    为帮助居民生活服务站提高业务水平，市商业部门组织理发业为工厂、机关、街道培养学徒。一些著名的餐馆派厨师去服务站传授烹调技术。（附图片）
