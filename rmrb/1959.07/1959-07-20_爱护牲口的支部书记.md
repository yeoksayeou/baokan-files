    The Party Branch Secretary Who Cherishes Livestock
    Recently, at a cadre meeting held by the CCP Dancheng County Committee in Henan, cadres from the Lizhuang Brigade of the Chengguan Commune told me a story about their Party Branch Secretary, Li Yufang, who cherishes livestock.
    In late May, on a night with bright moonlight and a gentle breeze carrying the fragrance of wheat, Li Yufang, the Party Branch Secretary of Lizhuang Brigade, arrived at the Fangzhuang Production Team to check on the wheat's maturity. It was already past midnight, and the commune members were asleep. Li Yufang, who had been running around all day, was also a bit tired, so he headed to the team's animal shed. Li Yufang had a habit of sleeping in the animal shed whenever he visited a production team.
    The Fangzhuang animal shed was dark and quiet, with only the occasional snoring of the caretakers. Li Yufang went inside and saw that the troughs were already empty. Wanting to let the caretakers sleep a little longer, he didn't say a word and quietly mixed grass for the animals. After seeing that the animals were full, Li Yufang took a short nap and then left the animal shed to discuss work with the production team leader.
    As dawn approached, Liu Shige, one of the caretakers, woke up and was startled. He quickly got up to mix grass for the animals, but they wouldn't even sniff at it. Upon closer inspection, the animals' bellies were already full. Liu Shige thought, "It must have been Liu Yubin and Fang Yuyong who fed them." When the other two woke up, they both said they had fallen asleep during the second half of the night and hadn't fed the animals. The three were puzzled and couldn't solve the mystery. At breakfast, Li Yufang happened to meet the three caretakers. Li Yufang said to them:
    "The wheat harvest is just around the corner, so we must take good care of the livestock. This team's thousand-plus mu of wheat all rely on them to pull! The three of you better take shifts feeding them, so you don't all fall asleep." Only then did the three caretakers understand the mystery.

### 爱护牲口的支部书记

    爱护牲口的支部书记
    最近，在中共河南郸城县委召开的一次干部会上，城关公社李庄大队的干部们，向我讲了关于他们大队党支部书记李玉芳爱护牲口的故事。
    5月下旬，一个月光皎洁的夜晚，微风拂拂，吹来阵阵麦香。李庄大队党支部书记李玉芳，因检查小麦成熟情况，来到了房庄生产队。这时已到半夜时分，社员们早已入睡。跑了一天的李玉芳也有些倦意，他便向这个队的饲养室走去。李玉芳有个习惯，不管到那个生产队，都喜欢在饲养室里睡觉。
    房庄饲养室里没有灯火，静悄悄地，不时传出饲养员的鼾声。李玉芳走进去一看，牲口槽里早已吃得净光。为了让饲养员们多睡一会，他一点也没有声张，轻手轻脚地给牲口拌草。李玉芳看牲口吃饱了，稍微打个盹，就走出饲养室，找生产队长研究工作去了。
    天快亮了，饲养员刘士阁一睁开眼，可慌透了，急忙起来给牲口拌草。拌上草，牲口闻也不闻。仔细看看，牲口肚子都吃得饱饱的。刘士阁心想：“一定是刘玉彬和房玉用两人喂饱的。”等他们两个人醒来，都说下半夜睡着了，没喂牲口。三个人有点奇怪，谁也猜不透这个迷。吃早饭时，李玉芳正好和三个饲养员碰了个面。李玉芳对他们说：
  “眼看就要收麦了，喂牲口要精心，这个队的一千多亩小麦，全靠它们拉呢！你们三个人最好换班喂，就不会都睡着了。”这时，三个饲养员才弄清了这个迷。
