    Manage Mid-Season Rice Well and Strive for a Bumper Harvest
    This year, southern provinces have expanded the acreage of mid-season rice. According to recent statistics, the planting of mid-season rice has exceeded the original plan. Grasping mid-season rice firmly and winning a bumper harvest is of great significance for increasing the total annual grain output.
    There are many favorable conditions for achieving a bumper harvest of mid-season rice. From the perspective of rice physiology, the entire period of vegetative growth of mid-season rice, from transplanting to harvesting, coincides with the time of year when days are long and nights are short. The plant produces more nutrients during the day through photosynthesis, and consumes fewer nutrients through respiration at night. Natural conditions are extremely favorable for a bumper harvest of mid-season rice. Secondly, the vegetative growth period of mid-season rice is longer than that of early rice, allowing more time to accumulate substances and produce nutrients. In addition, the operational techniques this year have been more solid. In general, the conditions for striving for a bumper harvest of mid-season rice are very good. However, if field management work is relaxed after transplanting, the desired results will not be achieved. The experience of bumper harvests of rice last year and wheat this year fully proves that only by doing a good job in field management can we further exert the effectiveness of soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, and close planting, and achieve a great harvest.
    Currently, the earlier planted mid-season rice is in the tillering stage, while the later planted rice will also begin to tiller soon. Because mid-season rice is transplanted later than early rice, the better fields have mostly been planted with early rice. The manure accumulated in winter and spring has also been used primarily for early rice and economic crops. Although the amount of fertilizer applied to mid-season rice fields is slightly more than in the same period last year, the base is weaker and the fertilizer is thinner compared to this year's early rice. In particular, in some areas where mid-season rice is planted after harvesting rapeseed and wheat, the plowing and harrowing are rough due to the rush to meet the season. Some areas report that there are more third-class rice seedlings in mid-season rice than in early rice, with short, small seedlings, yellow leaves, and few tillers. To quickly reverse this situation, it is necessary to launch a field management campaign centered on accumulating and topdressing fertilizer. Quick-acting fertilizers should be applied in stages during the early tillering stage, before or at the beginning of young panicle differentiation, and in the middle of the booting stage. Areas with limited fertilizer reserves should launch a crash program to accumulate fertilizer. Summer is the time when there are the most fertilizer sources, and collecting mountain green manure and lake grass can greatly increase the yield. Farmers have the experience: "Seeing green brings three parts of fertilizer." According to tests, various green grasses not only contain more than 0.4% nitrogen, but also more than 0.1% phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. As long as they are collected and composted in time, they can rot in a few days. Using well-composted fertilizer as topdressing has a faster effect and is conducive to crop absorption.
    Irrigation of mid-season rice fields is also very important. In addition to providing the normal growth needs of rice, it also has the effect of regulating temperature. According to some test results, rice fields with a night temperature of 20 to 21 degrees Celsius have heavier grains, better rice quality, and better root development than rice fields with a night temperature of 28 to 29 degrees Celsius. However, in many mid-season rice growing areas, the night temperature is high and the diurnal temperature range is small in July and August. These can cause floret degeneration, increased unfertilized or semi-fertilized grains (empty grains). It is best to irrigate shallowly during the day to prevent the soil temperature from being too high; in the evening, drain the warm water from the field to dissipate the radiant heat in the soil. In areas with better water conservancy conditions, the method of slow flow of water can also be adopted in the evening to lower the soil temperature.
    This year, insect pests in mid-season rice are relatively serious. On June 13, the pest and disease control station in Dongkou County, Hunan Province, found 36 to 40 rice planthoppers and leafhoppers per square foot, equivalent to 220,000 to 250,000 per mu, 200,000 leaf rollers, and 18,000 rice stem borers. Chen County also has the same situation. Two hundred to four hundred rice planthoppers and twenty to thirty leafhoppers can be caught in every hundred rice plants. This year, the insect pests that harm mid-season rice are fierce, reproduce quickly, and have a high population density. If insect control is not carried out early, massive symptoms such as scorched leaves, rotten stalks, and lodging will occur in a very short time, leaving behind hidden dangers and affecting the harvest. During this period, pest and disease forecasting work must be strengthened, and drug and equipment preparations should be as abundant as possible. Once an insect infestation occurs, the spirit of early treatment and small-scale treatment should be adhered to, and all pests should be wiped out before their peak occurrence.
    July is the period of booting and heading for mid-season rice. The upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River often have seasonal floods. In August and September, when mid-season rice is filling and maturing, coastal areas are often hit by typhoons. These directly threaten the safe growth of mid-season rice. However, as long as we strengthen forecasting work and make good use of the years of experience in flood and wind prevention, and strive for the initiative, losses can be effectively prevented and avoided.
    "Three parts planting, seven parts management". Whether this year's mid-season rice can achieve a bumper harvest and whether the mass bumper harvest movement can be developed in a balanced manner depends on how well the field management work is done in July and August. Time is running out, let's get started quickly!

### 管好中稻力争多收

    管好中稻力争多收
    今年南方各省都扩大了中稻面积，据最近统计，中稻已经超过了原定种植计划。狠狠抓住中稻，赢得中稻丰收，对增加全年的粮食总产量，有重大的意义。
    使中稻丰收，有很多有利条件。从水稻生理方面来看，中稻从插秧一直到收割，整个本田生长期间，正是全年昼长夜短的时候，白天光合作用制造养料多，夜间呼吸作用消耗养料少。自然条件对中稻的丰收，是极为有利的。其次，中稻的营养生长期比早稻长，有较多的时间积累物质，制造养料。另外，从操作技术方面看，今年作得也比较踏实。总的说，争取中稻丰收的条件是很好的。但是，如果插秧后的田间管理工作放松了，还是得不到预期效果的。去年水稻和今年小麦的丰收经验，都充分证明：只有搞好田间管理，才能进一步发挥土、肥、水、种、密的效能，取得大丰收。
    目前各地中稻插得早的，已在分蘖成期；插植较迟的，也将开始分蘖。因为中稻插秧比早稻迟，好一点的田，多半种上了早稻；冬春积攒的粪肥，也大部分优先用于早稻及经济作物。中稻田虽然比去年同期施肥略多，但同今年早稻相比却是底子差、肥料薄。特别是部分收获油菜及大小麦后栽插的中稻田，为了抢季节，犁耙粗糙。部分地区反映，中稻三类禾苗比早稻多，苗短小，叶片发黄，分蘖很少。要迅速扭转这种局面，必须开展以积肥、追肥为中心的田间管理运动。在分蘖初期，幼穗开始分化前或者分化初期，和孕穗中期，要分次追施速效性肥料。目前肥料存量不多的地区，要突击积肥。夏季肥源最多，采集山青、湖草、大有可为。农民们的经验：“见青三分肥”。据化验，各种青草，不仅含氮量都在0.4％以上，而且含有0.1％以上的磷肥和钾肥。只要及时采集、沤制，几天的时间就可以沤烂。把沤好的肥料作追肥，肥效较快，有利于作物吸收。
    中稻田的灌溉也非常重要。它除了供应水稻正常生长需要以外，还有调节温度的作用。据一些试验结果，晚间温度在摄氏二十到二十一度的稻田，比二十八度到二十九度的稻田谷粒重些，米质好些，根的发育也好一些。但是，不少种植中稻地区，7、8月份夜间温度高，昼夜温差小。这些都能使颖花退化，不实或半实粒（瘪谷）增多，最好白天浅灌，防止土温过高；傍晚将田中暖水排除，扩散土壤中的辐射热量。水利条件较好的地区，晚间还可以采取细水串流的办法，以降低土温。
    今年中稻虫害比较严重。湖南省洞口县病虫防治站6月13日检查，每平方市尺内，有稻飞虱、浮尘子三十六至四十只，折合每亩二十二万到二十五万只，卷叶虫二十万条，稻苞虫一万八千条。郴县也有同样情况，每一百蔸禾中，可以捉到稻飞虱二百至四百只，浮尘子二十到三十只。今年为害中稻的虫害，来势凶，繁殖快，虫口密度大。如不及早突击治虫，就会在很短时间内出现大量麻叶、烂秆、倒伏等现象，遗留后患，影响收成。在这个时期，虫情预测预报工作必须加强，药械准备要力求充足。一旦发生虫情，应本治早、治小的精神，在盛发之前，一网打尽。
    7月份，正是中稻孕穗、抽穗期间，长江上、中游，经常有季节性的大水。8、9月间，中稻正灌浆、成熟，沿海地区却常有台风侵袭。这些都直接威胁着中稻的安全生长。但是，只要加强预报工作，好好运用多年来防水、防风的经验，争取主动，是可以有效地防治和避免损失的。
      “三分栽秧，七分管理”。今年中稻能否取得丰收，能不能使大面积丰产运动平衡地开展起来，就看7、8月间的田间管理工作做得如何。事不宜迟，快快动手吧！
