Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 28th (By our reporter Wang Chongjie) It was reported: Hungary is currently gradually reforming its school education system to bring education closer to production and real life, so as to serve socialist construction more effectively. This was stated by Ilku Pál, Deputy Minister of Culture and Education of Hungary and Secretary-General of the Education Reform Committee, when he met with our reporter.

In order to vigorously carry out education reform work, the Council of Ministers decided in early July to establish an Education Reform Committee to be responsible for formulating reform plans and promoting education reform work. The chairman of this committee is Karai Gyula, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of State.

Ilku pointed out that certain achievements have been made in promoting comprehensive technical education in the fifth to eighth grades of primary schools in the past two years. More than 600 of the country's 6,200 primary schools have established practice workshops to provide students with industrial and agricultural technical education. Students cultivate labor habits through four hours of practical labor and operation each week. This measure has been warmly welcomed by parents. Many factories are also actively helping schools manufacture labor tools and establish workshops. In the new school year, comprehensive technical education in primary schools will develop faster. The number of primary schools with their own workshops will reach more than 1,200. It is planned to equip every primary school with a workshop within four or five years and universally carry out comprehensive technical education.

Speaking of secondary education, Deputy Minister Ilku said that in the future, secondary schools will mainly promote the practice of five days of classes per week and one day of participation in actual labor in factories or rural areas, so that secondary school students can initially master a production technology during their studies and directly participate in production work after graduation. After the start of the new school year this autumn, this measure will be implemented first in 300 classes in 114 middle schools. In order to avoid excessive burdens on students, it has been decided to streamline some unimportant teaching content in the courses.

Ilku also pointed out that the Council of Ministers recently adopted a resolution on the establishment of agricultural and technical schools. The resolution stipulates that juveniles aged 14 to 16 who do not continue their studies after graduating from primary school or whose weekly working hours are less than 36 hours should continue their studies in these schools. Two hundred such schools will be established in the new school year, and will be popularized throughout the country within three or four years.

In order to enable a large number of working youths and adults who directly participate in production to continuously improve their professional knowledge and cultural level after work, the government and various production units provide many care and assistance to employees who study by correspondence and attend night schools. Currently, the number of people studying by correspondence and attending night schools in secondary schools is equivalent to one-third of the total number of secondary school students.

Ilku said that this year, Hungarian universities and colleges gave priority to admitting young people who have participated in actual labor for one or two years. Many places have also begun to implement a social scholarship system, where various production units can select outstanding young workers to study in higher or secondary specialized schools. After graduation, these young people will still return to their original factories or rural areas to work. (Attached picture)

    匈牙利逐步改革学校教育制度
    小学建立实习车间　中学定期参加劳动
    推广农业技术学校　高校优先录取工农
    据新华社布达佩斯28日电　本社记者王崇杰报道：目前匈牙利正在逐步改革学校教育制度，使教育进一步接近生产和现实生活，以便更有效地为社会主义建设服务。这是匈牙利文化教育部副部长、教育改革委员会秘书长伊耳库·帕尔在接见本社记者时说的。
    为了大力进行教育改革工作，部长会议在7月初决定成立教育改革委员会，负责制订改革方案和推进教育改革工作。这个委员会的主席由社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、国务部长卡拉伊·久洛担任。
    伊耳库指出，最近两年来在小学五年级到八年级推行综合技术教育方面已取得了一定的成绩。在全国六千二百个小学中有六百多个建立了实习车间，对学生进行工业和农业技术教育，通过每周四小时的实际劳动和操作培养学生的劳动习惯。这个措施受到了学生家长们的热烈欢迎。很多工厂也积极帮助学校制造劳动工具，建立工作车间。在新学年中，小学综合技术教育将得到更快的发展。拥有自己的工作车间的小学将达到一千二百多个。计划在四五年内使每个小学都设有工作车间，普遍地进行综合技术教育。
    谈到中学教育时，伊耳库副部长说，今后在中学内主要将大力推行每周五天上课、一天到工厂或农村参加实际劳动的做法，使中学生在学习期间就能初步掌握一种生产技术，毕业后可以直接参加生产工作。在今年秋季新学年开始后，就要在一百一十四个中学的三百个班里首先贯彻这一措施。为了使学生负担不要过重，已决定精减一些课程中的不关紧要的教材内容。
    伊耳库还指出，最近部长会议还通过了一项关于成立农业和技术学校的决议。决议规定，凡是小学毕业不再继续升学的，或者每周劳动时间少于三十六小时的十四岁到十六岁的少年，都要到这些学校去继续学习。在新学年内将设立二百所这样的学校，三、四年内要普及全国各地。
    为了使大批直接参加生产的劳动青年和成年人能在工作之余不断地提高自己的专业知识和文化水平，政府和各生产单位给予函授学习和上夜校的职工们很多照顾和帮助。目前在中等学校函授学习和上夜校的人，相当于中等学校学生总数的三分之一。
    伊耳库说，今年匈牙利高等学校招生时优先录取了参加过一两年实际劳动的青年。很多地方并开始实行社会助学金的制度，各生产单位可以选派优秀劳动青年到高等或中等专科学校学习，毕业后这些青年仍回原工厂或农村工作。（附图片）
