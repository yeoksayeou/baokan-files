Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd. Kiwanuka, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Uganda National Congress, who is currently visiting China, told our reporter on the evening of the 21st: The people of Uganda are waging every struggle to swiftly end the colonial rule of British imperialism. Our slogan is "Self-government now!" He said, "The people of Uganda have had enough of British colonialism."

He said that the current struggle program of the National Congress is to implement self-government in Uganda in 1960 and independence in 1961. "We have full confidence that we will definitely be able to achieve our goals." "We are doing everything possible to mobilize the masses to put pressure on the British colonialists to achieve Uganda's independence. The people of Uganda are fully capable of managing their own country."

Kiwanuka pointed out: "In order to maintain its colonial rule, British imperialism is spreading rumors everywhere, saying that the Africans in Uganda are not capable of managing their own country. Currently, the British colonial authorities have declared a 'state of emergency' in Uganda, implemented a curfew, banned gatherings of more than twenty-five people, and sent police to suppress the masses who gathered despite the ban with tear gas and even gunfire."

Kiwanuka angrily spoke about the brutal exploitation and oppression of the Ugandan people by British imperialism since it ruled Uganda in 1876. He said: "Uganda is the country with the most cotton and coffee production in the British Commonwealth. However, we are stipulated to only sell cotton and coffee to the British at very low prices set by the British colonialists. Our people live extremely low lives. All senior government positions are held by British people, and Africans are not allowed to hold senior positions." "All of us Ugandan people demand a swift end to the rule of our mortal enemy, British colonialism."

Talking about his impressions of his visit to China, Kiwanuka said: "Since coming to China, I have been warmly welcomed everywhere. I have personally experienced the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Ugandan people. The amazing achievements of China in construction over the past ten years have left a very deep impression on me." "The friendship between Uganda and China has been greatly strengthened, and we thank the Chinese people for their support of the Ugandan people's struggle. I hope that the people of our two countries will unite more closely in the future."

During his stay in China, Kiwanuka visited Beijing and Shanghai.

    乌干达国民大会执委会主席谈斗争纲领
    结束殖民统治  实现国家独立
    新华社22日讯　正在中国访问的乌干达国民大会执行委员会主席基瓦努卡21日晚上对本社记者说：乌干达人民正在进行一切斗争以迅速结束英帝国主义的殖民统治。我们的口号是“现在就实行自治。”他说：“乌干达人民已经受够了英国殖民主义的统治。”
    他说，国民大会当前的斗争纲领是要在1960年在乌干达实行自治，1961年实行独立。“我们有充分的信心，我们一定能够实现我们的目标。”“我们正在尽一切力量动员群众对英殖民主义者施加压力，以实现乌干达的独立。乌干达人民完全有能力管理好自己的国家。”
    基瓦努卡指出：“英帝国主义者为了维持它的殖民统治正在到处大放厥词，说乌干达的非洲人没有能力管理自己的国家。目前，英殖民当局已宣布乌干达处于“紧急状态”，实行了宵禁，禁止二十五人以上的集会，并且派警察用催泪弹甚至开枪来镇压不顾禁令而集会的群众。”
    基瓦努卡愤怒地谈到英帝国主义自从1876年统治乌干达以来对乌干达人民的残酷剥削和压迫。他说：“乌干达是英联邦国家中产棉花和咖啡最多的国家。但是我们被规定只许把棉花和咖啡以英殖民主义者规定的很低的价格卖给英国。我们的人民过着极为低下的生活。所有的政府高级职位都是由英国人担任，非洲人是不许担任高级职位的。”“我们全体乌干达人民都要求迅速结束我们的死敌英国殖民主义者的统治。”
    谈到访问中国的印象时，基瓦努卡说：“来到中国后到处都受到热情的欢迎。我亲身体会到了中国人民对乌干达人民的深厚友谊。中国十年来在建设方面的惊人成就给了我非常深刻的印象。”“乌干达同中国的友谊是大大地加强了，我们感谢中国人民对乌干达人民斗争的支持。我希望今后两国人民将更加紧密地团结在一起。”
    基瓦努卡在中国期间曾访问了北京和上海。
