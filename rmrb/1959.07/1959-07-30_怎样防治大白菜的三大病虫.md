How to Prevent and Control the Three Major Diseases and Pests of Chinese Cabbage
Professor of Plant Protection Department, Beijing Agricultural University, Qiu Weiban

The three major diseases of Chinese cabbage are soft rot, downy mildew, and mosaic. Soft rot is quite common throughout the country and causes damage to a certain extent every year. Downy mildew is a Chinese cabbage disease in high-temperature areas, but it can also become epidemic under special climatic conditions. Mosaic exists in vast areas, but the incidence rate is generally very low, about 2%-3%. In years of large-scale outbreaks, such as 1952 and 1958, it occurred widely over large areas, and the incidence rate in some fields reached 100%. The year 1958 was a year when the three diseases occurred simultaneously. These diseases caused great losses to Chinese cabbage cultivation.

Chinese Cabbage Soft Rot

Past research has proven that soft rot is a bacterial disease that enters through wounds. Bacteria cannot invade healthy Chinese cabbage tissue. If the injured Chinese cabbage tissue still has wound-healing ability, bacteria cannot invade either. Factors affecting wound-healing ability are water immersion and lack of oxygen or excessively low temperatures. Excessive irrigation or rainwater accumulation can create such conditions. There are many sources of wounds, mainly insect damage. Wounds caused by insects are often difficult to heal because the insect's oral fluids prevent wound healing. In the North China region, yellow flea beetles, grubs, and cabbage white butterfly larvae are pests that injure Chinese cabbage. In the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions, seed maggots are an important disease-spreading vector.

The pathogenic bacteria of soft rot can survive in rotten vegetables for a long time, but after entering the soil, their lifespan is no more than half a month. Because this disease has many bacterial hosts, there are constantly bacteria present on the soil surface during the growing season, and there are also a large number of bacteria in vegetable cellars and waste vegetable leaves near the fields. The first few rotten Chinese cabbage plants that appear in the field are the main source of disease for the entire field. The bacteria on these rotten plants will spread in the field through irrigation water or insects.

Based on the above patterns, high-ridge cultivation can be adopted in prevention and control measures to avoid or reduce the water immersion and disease transmission caused by flooding irrigation. At the same time, underground and above-ground pests should also be eliminated to reduce insect damage to Chinese cabbage plants. Removing diseased plants in the field as early as possible, disinfecting the diseased holes, and then irrigating are also control methods. None of these measures can be emphasized alone; they must be used comprehensively.

The adoption of high-ridge vegetable cultivation must vary according to the terrain, groundwater level, and soil salinity and alkalinity, and high ridges cannot be used uniformly. High ridges are most suitable for slightly alkaline, high-water-table low-lying areas. Vegetable gardens with good irrigation systems can also use high ridges.

In terms of pest elimination, the use of 666 pesticide can not only eliminate pests but also stimulate the growth and development of Chinese cabbage.

In the past, some people used soil disinfection and other measures, which are unnecessary because the microorganisms contained in the soil itself can eliminate this pathogenic bacteria in a short period of time. After removing diseased plants, adding some lime or filling soil in the diseased holes is necessary because there are too many bacteria in the diseased holes and irrigation is urgent, so disinfectants should be added to promote the death of bacteria. In some areas of Shandong, Chinese cabbage has been continuously planted on the same land for a hundred years without changing the land, and it can still achieve high yields. This fact proves that soft rot bacteria cannot survive in the soil for a long time.

Chinese Cabbage Mosaic

Chinese cabbage mosaic only became a noteworthy issue in Chinese cabbage production after the large-scale outbreak in the Northeast in 1952. Mosaic is a disease caused by a virus. This disease can be transmitted by friction inoculation of diseased leaf juice. Aphids, especially peach aphids and radish aphids, are important vectors in natural transmission. The response of Chinese cabbage to virus infection also varies at different stages of development. The earlier the Chinese cabbage is infected with the virus, the more severe the subsequent disease. Diseased Chinese cabbage is of poor quality, low yield, difficult to store, and easily infected with soft rot.

There is no doubt that aphids are a major vector of disease transmission in the field. Where do aphids bring the virus from? Preliminary research has shown that most cruciferous crops can carry the virus, especially kale. This relationship has also been confirmed in experiments: that is, areas where kale is planted after Chinese cabbage seed collection and then Chinese cabbage is planted again have particularly high mosaic incidence. Areas where kale is planted alone without seed collection and then Chinese cabbage is planted have less mosaic disease. Areas where only Chinese cabbage is planted without seed collection or kale planting have the least mosaic incidence.

In terms of varieties, some varieties have strong resistance to the disease, such as "Shandong No. 1", "Shandong No. 2", "Gongzhuling Dama Leaf" and "Xingcheng Dama Leaf", etc.; some varieties have low resistance to the disease, such as Shandong's "Jiao Cai" and Northeast's "Ban Cuo Cai", etc. Some varieties are resistant to the disease in the Beijing area, but they are not resistant to the disease in Xingcheng, Northeast, such as Beijing's "Qingbai Kou".

In terms of prevention and control design, the use of nutrient seedling beds has a good effect. After transplanting seedlings cultivated by this method, the damage of mosaic is significantly reduced, and the yield increase is as high as 30%. From the pesticide control experiments, it can be seen that controlling aphids in the middle and late stages of Chinese cabbage development does not have a very significant effect on the performance of mosaic symptoms and yield increase in the current year. It can be seen that grasping the control of aphids during the seedling stage is a key point in prevention and control.

Chinese Cabbage Downy Mildew

The prevalence and occurrence of downy mildew were originally limited to coastal areas with very high relative humidity; it is also prone to occur in areas that are sunny after rain, where the temperature rises, or where there is a large temperature difference between day and night and heavy dew.

Judging from the existing research data, the spore germination and invasion of this disease generally require a lower temperature (below 18 degrees Celsius), while the development after invasion requires a higher temperature (above 20 degrees Celsius). Therefore, areas with more dew and low temperatures at night and higher temperatures during the day, such as Zhengding and south of it in Hebei Province, can also experience large-scale outbreaks even without rain. It is relatively difficult to control the occurrence of downy mildew by controlling the microclimate, and there is currently no such design.

The occurrence of downy mildew in the field, like potato late blight, is formed by central diseased plants, which shows that its oospores play a very important role. Starting with the elimination of central diseased plants in the prevention and control measures, the prevention and control effect may be greater. It is also difficult to use chemicals for prevention and control. Bordeaux mixture is harmful to Chinese cabbage. In terms of chemical control, 800 times dilution of zineb and 0.05% ethyl mercuric phosphate emulsion (produced in Japan), etc., can be tried at present.

Changing nutritional conditions or applying some trace elements and other chemical substances to change the resistance of Chinese cabbage to downy mildew is a research direction, and agricultural scientific research departments or production units with conditions can carry it out.

    怎样防治大白菜的三大病虫
    北京农业大学植物保护系教授　裘维蕃
  白菜的三大病害是软腐病、霜霉病和孤丁。软腐病在全国相当普遍，每年都有一定程度的为害。霜霉病是高温地区的白菜病害；但在气候特殊的情况下也会流行。孤丁在广大地区都存在，但一般年份发病率很低，大约在2％—3％左右，在大发生年，如1952和1958年在大面积上普遍发生，而且有些地里的受病率达百分之百。1958年是三种病害并发的一年，这些病害给大白菜栽培带来很大的损失。
        大白菜软腐病
    过去的研究证明，软腐病是一种由伤口侵入的细菌性病害。在健全的白菜组织上，细菌是不能侵入的。受伤的白菜组织如果尚有伤愈能力，细菌也不能侵入。影响伤愈能力的因素是伤口受水浸而缺氧或温度太低。大水漫灌或大雨积水，都能造成这种条件。伤口的来源很多，主要的是虫伤。由昆虫造成的伤口往往不易愈合，因为昆虫的口液有阻止伤愈的作用。在华北地区黄条跳?、蛴螬、菜白蝶等幼虫都是伤菜的虫害。在东北和内蒙古地区，种蝇是一个重要的诱病媒介。
    软腐病的病原细菌，可以在烂菜中存活很久，但是进入土壤后，寿命不出半个月。由于这种病害的细菌寄主很多，在生长季节中，土层表面不断有细菌的存在，菜窖和地边的废菜叶中也有大量的细菌。在白菜地中最初出现的几株烂菜是全田发病的主要来源，这些烂菜上的细菌，会随灌溉水或昆虫在田间传布。
    根据上述规律，在防治措施上首先可采用高畦栽培，以避免或减少漫灌所起的浸水和传病的作用。同时也应当消灭地下害虫、地上害虫，以减少菜株的虫伤。及早拔除田间病株，消毒病穴，然后灌水，也是一个防治办法。这些措施不能单独强调任何一个，必须综合使用。
    采用高畦栽菜，必须根据地势、地下水位和土壤盐碱性而有所不同，不能一律用高畦。高畦最适用于轻碱性、高水位的低洼地。有良好灌溉系统的菜园也可采用高畦。
    在消灭害虫方面，用六六六剂不但能消除害虫，而且有刺激白菜生长发育的作用。
    过去有人采用土壤消毒等，这是不必要的措施，因为土壤本身所含的微生物能在短期内消灭这种病原细菌。在拔除病株后，病穴内加些石灰或填土，是必要的，这是因为病穴内细菌过多，同时又急于灌溉，所以要加消毒剂以促使细菌的死灭。山东有些地区，在同一地上已连栽百年的大白菜而没有换地，也仍能丰产。这一事实证明，软腐病细菌在土壤中是不能久存的。
        大白菜孤丁
    大白菜孤丁，1952年在东北大发生以后，才成为白菜生产中一个引人注意的问题。孤丁是一种病毒所致的病害。这种病害通过病叶液汁的摩擦接种可以传毒。蚜虫，特别是桃蚜和萝卜蚜是自然传毒中的重要媒介。白菜的发育各阶段对病毒感染的反应也不同。白菜感染病毒愈早，以后的发病愈重。染病的白菜质量差、产量低，不容易贮藏，而且还容易感染软腐病。
    蚜虫是一个田间传毒的主要媒介已无疑问。蚜虫从那里带来的病毒呢？研究初步证明，所有十字花科作物极大部分都能带毒，特别是甘蓝。这种关系在试验中也证实：即白菜采种后栽甘蓝，以后再种白菜的地区，孤丁特别多。不采种单种甘蓝，最后种大白菜的，毒病较少。既不采种，也不种甘蓝，而单种白菜的地区，孤丁最少。
    在品种方面，有些品种的抗病力很强，例如“山东一号”、“山东二号”、“公主岭大麻叶”和“兴城大麻叶”等；有些品种的抗病力很低，例如山东的“胶菜”和东北的“半矬菜”等。有些品种在北京地区抗病，但是到东北的兴城便不抗病，例如北京的“青白口”。
    在防治设计方面，采用营养苗床的方法效果不错。从这样措施育成的菜苗移栽后，孤丁的为害显然减轻，增产最高达30％。从药剂防治试验中可以看出，在白菜发育中后期防治蚜虫，对当年的孤丁症状表现及增产上所起的作用不很显著。由此可见，抓紧苗期防治蚜虫是防治上的一个关键。
        白菜霜霉病
    霜霉病的流行和发生，原来限于相对湿度很高的沿海地区；先雨后晴，气温升高或白昼和晚上温差大、露水重的地区，也容易发生。
    从已有的研究资料看，这一病害的孢子萌发和侵入，一般要求较低的温度（摄氏十八度以下）而侵入后的发展，则要求较高的温度（二十度以上）。因此夜间多露而温度低，白昼温度较高的地区，如河北正定及以南地区，虽然无雨，也能大量发生。要从控制小气候来防霜霉病的发生是比较困难的，目前也还没有这种设计。
    霜霉病在田间的发生和马铃薯晚疫病一样，是由中心病株形成的，这说明它的卵孢子所起的作用甚大。防治措施中从消灭中心病株开始，防治效果就可能较大。防治上使用药剂也很困难，波尔多液对白菜有药害。在药剂防治上，目前可以试用八百倍的代森锌和0.05％的乙基磷酸汞制乳剂（日本产）等。
    改变营养条件或施用一些微量元素、其他化学物质来改变白菜对霜霉病的抗病性，是一个研究的方向，农业科学研究部门或有条件的生产单位可以进行。
