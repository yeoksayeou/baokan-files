Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 12th: Kerala Chief Minister Namboodiripad held a two-hour meeting with Prime Minister Nehru in Simla on the 11th regarding the Kerala situation. On the evening of the 10th, he also met with President Prasad.

After returning to New Delhi, Namboodiripad said at a press conference this morning that the current tense situation in Kerala was caused by the Congress Party's use of "direct action from below and central intervention from above."

According to the "Indian Express" on the 12th, Namboodiripad told reporters in Simla after meeting with Nehru on the 11th that if the central government interferes in Kerala, it "will cause mass protests in the state and other parts of the country."

Namboodiripad arrived in New Delhi from Kerala on the 9th to consult with the Indian central government on the state situation. Before going to Simla to meet Nehru, he expressed opposition at a mass meeting in New Delhi on the evening of the 10th to demands that the Kerala government resign or order mid-term elections in Kerala, and opposed central government intervention. He said that he had never heard of a precedent or practice of a state government established with the trust of the State Legislative Assembly resigning under the threat of central intervention.

He revealed that the disturbances created by the opposition to paralyze the state government are still ongoing.

The National Committee of the Communist Party of India will hold a meeting in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala, on the 13th to discuss the Kerala situation. Namboodiripad will report on his meeting with Nehru at the meeting.

This newspaper reports: The Kerala government, respecting Prime Minister Nehru's suggestion, has repeatedly expressed its willingness to consult with opposition parties, but the opposition parties in Kerala have rejected this suggestion and are still attempting to force the state government to "resign," thus complicating the situation.

According to Indian newspapers, Prime Minister Nehru put forward several suggestions for resolving the disputes in the state during his visit to Kerala in late June. The first two suggestions included: the Kerala government should discuss their complaints about the government with various opposition parties; and school administrators and other relevant parties should be invited to participate in discussions in order to appropriately modify the disputed provisions of the Education Act. As early as the beginning of the movement in Kerala by the opposition parties on the pretext of opposing the Education Act to overthrow the state government, the state government repeatedly made it clear that it was willing to sit down with them to discuss the Education Act issue, but absolutely disagreed to discuss the so-called resignation of the government. After Prime Minister Nehru's suggestions were put forward, the Kerala government immediately expressed its acceptance of the above two suggestions. The state government invited managers of private schools and other relevant parties to hold talks on the disputed Education Act. However, the opposition parties and sectarian forces still refused to stop violent actions, and the managers of private schools did not accept the invitation.

In a statement on July 6, Namboodiripad criticized the Congress Party's rejection of Prime Minister Nehru's two suggestions. He said: "We have accepted the Prime Minister's two suggestions," and the Prime Minister himself has said that the state government has "partially accepted" his suggestions. However, the policy prescribed by the Congress Party headquarters and followed by the Kerala Congress Party violates the Prime Minister's suggestion. He also said: "The silence of the Congress Party leaders in the state regarding the indiscriminate destruction of transportation and schools, while at the same time their rhetoric about strengthening the uncompromising struggle has taken on new and more effective forms, makes it seem as if the Congress Party leaders in the state have formulated a coordinated plan."

Prime Minister Nehru said on July 7, when talking about the issue of whether the Indian central government could intervene in the Kerala situation: "Our attitude under normal circumstances is: the central authorities should intervene. Secondly, if any so-called intervention is carried out, it should be done in a persuasive manner." He also said, "If a situation arises that cannot be handled in any other way, people have to consider other intervention methods. These are normal methods. We avoid the final unexpected event, and if there is no other way, then we have to take this method. I can't say what to do now."

Nehru has been on vacation in Simla for ten days starting on July 8.

The day after Nehru made his remarks, Namboodiripad decided to visit Indian President Prasad, the Minister of the Interior and others in Delhi, and to meet with Prime Minister Nehru in Simla. At the same time, Namboodiripad reiterated his willingness to hold talks with all opposition parties. He said that the state government's policy will be to pursue a path sufficient to enable the government and all opposition parties to hold talks. The time is ripe to convene such a meeting. We will send them a formal invitation.

On the same day, Chacko, the leader of the Congress Party parliamentary group in Kerala, said in response to Namboodiripad's above remarks that the Congress Party "does not object to discussing any issues with the Kerala government," but he also said that "no discussion can lead to a solution to the political issues related to the current crisis." He still believes that the state government should resign.

Shankar, the chairman of the Kerala State Committee of the Congress Party, handed over a "memorandum" attacking the state government to President Prasad on the 10th. After meeting with the President, he told reporters, "We hope that we have convinced the President that it is necessary for the central government to immediately intervene in Kerala and hold new elections." The Indian Congress Party also issued a statement on the 10th: "If the Kerala government is allowed to complete its five-year term, then all democracy in Kerala will come to an end, and democracy in other parts of the country will be seriously threatened."

Namboodiripad said at a public gathering in New Delhi on the 10th that there is no question of the state government resigning or holding mid-term elections in Kerala.

    南布迪里巴德同尼赫鲁会谈
    邦政府重申愿同反对党协商　但国大党仍要求中央干涉
    新华社新德里12日电　喀拉拉邦首席部长南布迪里巴德11日在西姆拉就喀拉拉邦问题同尼赫鲁总理举行了两小时的会谈。10日晚上，他还同普拉沙德总统举行了会谈。
    南布迪里巴德回到新德里后，在今天上午举行的记者招待会上说，喀拉拉邦目前的紧张局势是国大党用“来自下面的直接行动和来自上面的中央干涉”所造成的。
    据12日的“印度快报”报道，南布迪里巴德11日在同尼赫鲁会晤后，在西姆拉向报界发表谈话说，如果中央对喀拉拉邦进行干涉，“在邦内和国内其他地区将引起群众性抗议”。
    南布迪里巴德是在9日从喀拉拉邦来到新德里，就邦局势同印度中央政府进行商谈。他在去西姆拉会见尼赫鲁以前，10日晚上在新德里举行的群众大会上表示反对要喀拉拉邦政府辞职或者下令在喀拉拉邦举行期中选举，并且反对中央政府进行干涉。他说，他从没有听到过一个获得邦立法会议的信任而建立的邦政府在中央干涉的威胁下辞职的先例或惯例。
    他揭露，反对党为了瘫痪邦政府而制造的骚动仍然在进行。
    印度共产党全国委员会13日将在喀拉拉邦首府特里凡得琅举行会议讨论喀拉拉邦局势。南布迪里巴德将在会上报告他同尼赫鲁会谈的情况。
    本报讯　喀拉拉邦政府尊重尼赫鲁总理的建议，一再表示愿同反对党进行协商，但喀拉拉邦的反对党派拒绝了这个建议，仍然企图迫使邦政府“辞职”，因而使局势复杂化。
    据印度报纸透露，尼赫鲁总理在6月下旬访问喀拉拉邦时，提出了解决邦内纠纷的几项建议。其中的头两项建议包括：喀拉拉邦政府应该同各反对党派讨论它们对政府的抱怨；并应邀请学校管理人和其他有关人士参加讨论，以便适当地修改教育法中引起争端的规定。早在喀拉拉邦反对党借口反对教育法而掀起推翻邦政府的运动初期，邦政府就一再明确表示愿意同它们坐下来讨论教育法问题，但是绝对不同意讨论所谓政府辞职问题。在尼赫鲁总理的建议提出后，喀拉拉邦政府立即表示接受上述两项建议。邦政府邀请私立学校的管理人和其他有关人士就存在争端的教育法举行会谈。但是，反对党和教派势力仍不肯停止暴力行动，私立学校的管理人也没有接受邀请。
    南布迪里巴德在7月6日一项声明中，批评了国大党对尼赫鲁总理的两项建议采取拒绝的态度。他说：“我们已经接受总理的那两个建议”，总理本人曾说过邦政府“部分地接受了”他的建议。然而，国大党总部所规定的并且为喀拉拉邦国大党所奉行的方针违反了总理的建议。他还说：“邦内国大党领袖对于不分青红皂白破坏交通工具和学校的事保持沉默，而同时他们关于加强不妥协斗争的言论采取了新的更为有效的形式，这使人们看来好像邦内国大党领袖制订了一个配合一致的计划。”
    尼赫鲁总理在7月7日谈到印度中央政府能否干涉喀拉拉邦局势的问题时说：“我们在一般情况下的态度是：中央当局应该进行干涉。其次，如果进行任何所谓干涉的话，那应该用劝告的方式”。他又说，“如果产生了用其他方式无法处理的局势，人们不得不考虑别种干涉办法。这些是正常的方式。我们避免最后的意外事件，如果没有其他办法，那只有采取这个办法。我现在说不上该怎么办”。
    尼赫鲁已于7月8日起赴西姆拉休假十天。
    在尼赫鲁发表谈话的第二天，南布迪里巴德决定赴德里访问印度总统普拉沙德、内政部长和其他人，并且要到西姆拉去会见尼赫鲁总理。同时，南布迪里巴德重申愿意同各反对党举行会谈。他说，邦政府的政策将是奉行足以使政府和各反对党举行会谈的道路。现在召开这种会议的时机成熟了。我们将向它们发出正式邀请。
    同一天，喀拉拉邦国大党议会党团领袖查科针对南布迪里巴德的上述谈话说：国大党“并不反对同喀拉拉邦政府讨论任何问题”，但是他又说，“任何讨论也不能促使同目前危机有关的政治问题得到解决”。他仍然认为邦政府应该辞职。
    国大党喀拉拉邦委员会主席山卡尔10日把一份攻击邦政府的“备忘录”交给普拉沙德总统。他在同总统会谈以后对报界说，“我们希望我们已经说服总统，使他感到有必要由中央政府立即对喀拉拉邦进行干涉，并且重新举行大选。”印度国大党也在10日发表声明：“如果让喀拉拉邦政府任满它的五年任期，那么，在喀拉拉邦的一切民主就会终结，这个国家的其他地方的民主将受到严重威胁。”
    南布迪里巴德10日在新德里一公众集会上说，根本不存在邦政府辞职或者在喀拉拉邦举行期中选举的问题。
