Harvesting rice under the high blue sky, white clouds drifting, sickles dance across the fields and threshing grounds, cutting with ever more vigor, the bountiful harvest brings smiles from the heart.

　　＊　＊White clouds drift, songs echo, bundles of rice held high to the sky, threshing and shaking more, not letting a single golden grain be missed.

    收打稻谷蓝天高，白云飘，满畈满场舞镰刀，越割越有劲，丰收逗出心底笑。
    ＊　＊白云飘，歌声绕，稻把举得齐天高，多掼多抖，金珠粒粒不漏掉。
