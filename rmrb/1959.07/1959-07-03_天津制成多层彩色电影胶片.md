    Tianjin Makes Multi-Layer Color Movie Film
    The multi-layer color movie film trial-produced by the Tianjin Photographic Equipment Factory has been used by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio to reproduce color films such as the ballet "Swan Lake." Recently, they conducted a trial screening in Tianjin and considered the colors to be basically successful.
    Color movie film is a type of photosensitive film with a relatively complex manufacturing process. The required raw materials include more than 200 kinds of intermediates and auxiliary materials, in addition to the film base. Although the Tianjin Photographic Equipment Factory has relatively weak technical equipment, its employees actively overcame difficulties and successfully trial-produced various sensitizers, stabilizers, and the like. The Tianjin Daily Chemical Research Institute, Tianjin University, and other units also supplied them with the necessary basic raw materials and various chemical reagents.

    天津制成多层彩色电影胶片
    天津摄影器材厂试制成功的多层彩色电影胶片，已由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂用来复制芭蕾舞剧“天鹅湖”等彩色影片。最近，他们在天津作了试映，认为颜色基本上是成功的。
    彩色电影胶片，是感光胶片中制造技术比较复杂的品种。所需原料，除片基外，中间体和辅助材料有二百多种。天津摄影器材厂虽然技术设备相当薄弱，但是职工们积极克服困难，试制成功了各种增感剂、稳定剂等。天津市日用化工研究所、天津大学等单位也供应了他们所需的基本原料、和各种化学药剂。
