    Drawing on Past Experience and Combining with Current Conditions
    Hukuan Improves Mobile Office Methods
    The improved methods organically combine the county committee's collective mobile office work with division of labor and contracted responsibilities, inspection and evaluation, regular visits, and red flag competitions. This allows each county committee member to have time to "dissect a sparrow" (study a specific case in detail) and opportunities to understand the overall work. At the same time, it enriches the content of mobile office work, closely integrates regular visits with central tasks, and institutionalizes evaluation.
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Hukuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, conscientiously implementing the Party's mass line work method, has adopted the method of cadres going to the countryside for collective mobile office work, which has powerfully promoted production.
    Hukuan County's method of cadres going to the countryside for mobile office work began in April 1957. After the communization last year, Hukuan and Pingshun counties were merged into one county, the area became more vast, and the commune was a socialist grassroots unit combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, as well as government and commune functions, making the work more complex and the tasks more arduous. In response to this situation, the county committee, based on a serious summary of past experiences, improved the mobile office method. The improved method drew on many effective leadership methods from before communization, closely integrating mobile office work with division of labor and contracted responsibilities, inspection and evaluation, regular visits, and red flag competitions.
    The method of combining mobile office work with division of labor and contracted responsibilities is a good form for implementing collective leadership and division of responsibilities. After implementing this method, each county committee member is assigned to be responsible for a commune, using the methods of going down to help with work and contacting them by phone and letter, being responsible for them throughout the year. This facilitates going deep into key areas and strengthening specific leadership of the communes. After a quarter, they collectively go to the countryside for mobile office work once, to comprehensively understand the work of the entire county, so that each county committee member has ample time to go deep into key areas, dissect sparrows, and create typical examples, and also so that each member has the opportunity to understand the overall work of the entire county, bringing into play the role of collective leadership. Last winter, not long after the two counties merged, some of the county committee members were originally from Hukuan County and did not understand the work situation in Pingshun; some were originally from Pingshun County and did not understand the work situation in Hukuan. Therefore, there were many difficulties in discussing this year's leap forward plan for the entire county. After the mobile office work, each member of the county committee had a general understanding of the situation in the entire county, and then they were able to formulate a leap forward plan that was in line with reality.
    Inspection and evaluation is one of the important methods for promoting work. In the past, when the county committee carried out mobile office work, it was actually a form of inspection. However, because all those participating in the mobile office work were county-level cadres, it was only a top-down inspection. Now, by combining mobile office work with inspection and evaluation, and absorbing commune cadres to participate, the mobile office work has become more lively and dynamic. This method of combining top-down and bottom-up inspection and evaluation has had a very good effect on mutual learning and mutual promotion. In March of this year, when the county committee went to the countryside for mobile office work, it absorbed the participation of commune party committee secretaries, and promptly summarized fifteen advanced experiences in accumulating fertilizer, managing wheat, turning fields into gardens, and hoeing and harrowing land, which greatly promoted the spring plowing and wheat topdressing movement at that time. Everyone agreed that this method was much better than holding meetings in the county to introduce experiences. The method of combining mobile office work with inspection and evaluation also makes it easier to establish opposing sides in production and work, which facilitates the implementation of the leadership method of grasping both ends to bring along the middle, and more powerfully promotes the advance of the movement.
    Regularly visiting commune members has become a system among leaders at all levels in Hukuan County for several years. Now, combining this system with mobile office work closely integrates it with the central tasks. During this year's mobile office work, the county committee organized more than 1,400 county and commune cadres, carrying more than 15,000 letters of condolence, and went deep into the homes of commune members, visiting more than 6,300 people, including family members of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, demobilized and transferred soldiers, outstanding commune members, technicians, and veteran farmers who had made contributions in the Great Leap Forward in 1958. During the visits, they listened to the criticisms and suggestions of the masses, helped them solve difficulties in production and life, and inspired the commune members to strive for greater leaps forward. Liang Changfa, a 73-year-old man from Huangniu Yao, shed tears of joy when he saw the responsible comrade of the county committee visiting his home, and repeatedly said: I did 250 workdays in the Great Leap Forward last year, and this year I will make greater efforts and do more workdays than last year.
    Around this year's new leap forward plan, the county committee organized a socialist labor competition movement with a "five-level linked red flag" system involving the county, competition zones (the county is divided into six competition zones), communes, management districts, production teams, and individuals. In the competition, a small evaluation is held every month, and a large evaluation is held every quarter. The large evaluation is combined with mobile office work. This institutionalizes the regular evaluation system and powerfully promotes the competition movement. During the mobile office work in March of this year, a total of ten red flag advanced units were evaluated, and models for various tasks were established, pushing the socialist labor competition movement of exerting full effort, striving for the top, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced to a climax.

    吸取过去经验  结合当前情况
    壶关改进巡回办公办法
    改进后的办法，使县委集体巡回办公和分工包干、检查评比、定期访问、红旗竞赛有机地结合了起来。这样，使得每个县委委员，既有“解剖麻雀”的时间，也有了解全面工作的机会。同时，也充实了巡回办公的内容，把定期访问和中心工作密切结合起来，并使评比成为制度化。
    本报讯　中共山西壶关县委，认真贯彻党的群众路线的工作方法，采取了干部集体下乡巡回办公的办法，有力地推动了生产。
    壶关县干部下乡巡回办公的办法，是在1957年4月份开始实行的。去年公社化后，壶关和平顺县合并成了一个县，地区更加辽阔了，公社又是一个农林牧副渔相结合、政社合一的社会主义基层单位，工作就更加复杂，任务也更加繁重了。针对这种情况，县委在认真总结过去经验的基础上，对巡回办公的办法作了改进。改进后的办法，吸取了公社化前许多行之有效的领导方法，使巡回办公和分工包干、检查评比、定期访问、红旗竞赛等密切结合了起来。
    巡回办公与分工包干相结合的方法，是贯彻集体领导与分工负责制的好形式。实行这一办法后，每个县委委员都分工包干一个社，采用下去帮助工作和电话、写信联系的方法，常年包干到底。这样便于深入重点，加强公社的具体领导。在一个季度之后，集体下乡巡回办公一次，全面了解全县工作，使每个县委委员，既有深入重点、解剖麻雀、创造典型的充裕时间，也可使每个委员有了解全县全面工作的机会，发挥集体领导的作用。去年冬季，两县合并不久，县委中，一部分是原壶关县委委员，对平顺的工作情况不了解；一部分是原平顺县委委员，对壶关的工作情况也不了解，因此在讨论今年全县的跃进规划时，有很多困难。经过巡回办公后，县委的每个成员对全县情况都有了概括的了解，才制定出了切合实际的跃进计划。
    检查评比，是推动工作的重要方法之一。过去县委巡回办公时，对工作实际上也是一次检查。但由于参加巡回办公的都是县级干部，因此仅是自上而下的一种检查。现在，把巡回办公与检查评比结合起来，吸收公社干部参加，这样就使巡回办公更加生动活泼。这种自上而下和自下而上的检查评比相结合的办法，对互相学习，互相促进，产生了很好的效果。今年3月间，县委在下乡巡回办公时，吸收了公社党委书记参加，及时地总结了积肥造肥、小麦管理、园田化、耪耙地等十五项先进经验，大大推动了当时的备耕和小麦返青追肥运动。大家一致认为，这种方法比在县上开会介绍经验好的多。巡回办公与检查评比相结合的办法，也容易在生产和工作中树立对立面，便于贯彻抓两头带中间的领导方法，更加有力地推动运动前进。
    定期访问社员，几年来在壶关县各级领导干部中间已经形成了一种制度。现在，把这一制度和巡回办公结合起来，就使它和中心工作密切结合在一起。县委在今年巡回办公中，组织了一千四百多个县、社干部，携带了一万五千多份慰问信，深入社员家庭，对在1958年大跃进中有功劳的烈属、军属、复员、转业军人、优秀社员、技术员和老农等六千三百多人进行了访问。在登门访问中，听取了群众的批评和建议，帮助他们解决了生产、生活上的困难，鼓舞了社员争取更大跃进的斗志。黄牛搢七十三岁的老汉梁长法，看到了县委负责同志到他家访问时，高兴得流出了眼泪，再三说：去年大跃进我做了二百五十个劳动日，今年我要出更大的力，比去年做更多的劳动日。
    围绕今年新的跃进计划，县委组织了县、竞赛区（全县共划分了六个竞赛战区）、公社、管理区、生产队、人与人的“五级连环红旗”的社会主义劳动竞赛运动。在竞赛中，每月举行一小评比，每季举行一大评比。大评比，和巡回办公相结合。这样，就使定期评比制度化，有力地推动了竞赛运动。在今年3月份巡回办公时，共评比出红旗先进单位十个，树立了各项工作的典型，把鼓足干劲，力争上游，学先进，赶先进的社会主义劳动竞赛运动推向了高潮。
