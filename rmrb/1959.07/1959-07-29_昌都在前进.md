    Qamdo City is the capital of Qamdo Prefecture, one of the three major parts of Tibet. It is located in a valley surrounded by mountains at the foot of the Damara Mountains, on the delta of the Zaqiu River and the Omu River, a city with mountains behind it and water in front. Qamdo is the gateway and door from Sichuan and Yunnan to pre- and post-Tibet, with an altitude of about 3,400 meters.
    Qamdo was liberated on October 19, 1950. On January 1, 1951, the Qamdo Prefecture People's Liberation Committee was established. In November 1952, the Kangzang Highway was opened to traffic to Qamdo, greatly shortening the journey from the mainland to Qamdo and from Qamdo to Lhasa.
    Before liberation, Qamdo had only one narrow street. After liberation, a new urban area appeared opposite the old urban area, and a wide street appeared. State-owned trading companies, grain companies, banks, post and telecommunications bureaus, people's hospitals, and Xinhua bookstores have appeared one after another. A prosperous scene has appeared in the market. Local specialties from eastern Tibet are transported to the mainland from here; various industrial products transported from the mainland are also continuously transported from here to various mountain villages and pastures.
    In 1956, Qimei Gongbu and Puba Benceng, counter-revolutionaries in the Qamdo area, colluded with bandits who had fled from east of the Jinsha River to organize armed rebellion, but were quickly quelled by the People's Liberation Army and people of all ethnic groups. In April of this year, the Qamdo Area Military Control Commission and the Qamdo County People's Government were established. The people of all ethnic groups in Qamdo beat gongs and drums to warmly celebrate the establishment of the Military Control Commission and the County People's Government, and to welcome their new life. At present, people of all ethnic groups are eagerly demanding democratic reforms, and slogans such as "Demand democratic reforms, smash the feudal system, and thoroughly liberate the working people" have appeared on colorful signs in the streets.

    昌都在前进
    昌都城是西藏三大部分之一——昌都地区的首府，位于达马拉山麓的一个群山环绕的峡谷里、杂楚河和鄂穆楚河的三角洲上，是一个背山面水的城市。昌都是从四川、云南进入前、后藏的孔道和大门，海拔约三千四百米。
    1950年10月19日昌都解放。1951年1月1日昌都地区人民解放委员会成立。1952年11月康藏公路通车到昌都，从内地到昌都和从昌都到拉萨的行程大大缩短。
    解放前，昌都只有一条狭窄的街道。解放后，在旧市区的对面，出现了新市区，一条宽阔的大街出现了。国营贸易公司、粮食公司、银行、邮电局、人民医院、新华书店都陆续出现。市场上出现了繁荣景象，西藏东部的土特产，都从这里运往内地；内地运来的各种工业品，也不断从这里运到各个山村和牧场。
    1956年，昌都地区的反革命分子齐眉公布、普巴本曾勾结从金沙江以东逃窜来的叛匪，组织武装叛乱，但很快就被人民解放军和各族人民平息。今年4月，昌都地区军事管制委员会、昌都县人民政府成立。昌都的各族人民敲锣打鼓，热烈庆祝军管会和县人民政府成立，迎接自己的新生。目前，各族人民迫切要求民主改革，街头的彩牌上已出现了这样的标语：“要求进行民主改革，摧垮封建制度，彻底解放劳动人民。”（李蕙云）
