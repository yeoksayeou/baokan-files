    Nyasaland Africans Persist in Resistance Struggle
    Sumba dispatch from the capital of Nyasaland: The British colonial governor of Nyasaland, Armitage, admitted on the 6th that in some areas of Nyasaland, Africans are still continuing their resistance struggle three months after the anti-colonialist struggle climaxed by the Nyasaland people this spring was suppressed.
    He stated that the British colonial authorities will continue to implement the bloody policy of armed suppression, and are making excuses for this by saying that some people will try to "create" further "riots".
    During the climax of the anti-colonialist struggle that broke out in Nyasaland this spring, the British colonial authorities sent a large number of military police to search and massacre everywhere. According to figures released by the authorities alone, five or sixty Africans were killed; and about one thousand people were arrested.

    尼亚萨兰非洲人坚持反抗斗争
    尼亚萨兰首府松巴消息：尼亚萨兰英国殖民总督阿米塔季6日承认，在尼亚萨兰人民今年春天掀起的反殖民主义斗争高潮被镇压三个月以后，若干地区的非洲人仍在继续进行反抗斗争。
    他表示英国殖民当局将继续执行武装镇压的血腥政策，并且为此制造借口说，有些人士将设法“制造”进一步的“暴乱”。
    在今年春天尼亚萨兰爆发的反殖民主义斗争的高潮中，英国殖民当局曾经派出大批军警到处进行搜捕和屠杀。仅据当局公布的数字，非洲人被杀害的有五、六十人；被捕的人达一千左右。
