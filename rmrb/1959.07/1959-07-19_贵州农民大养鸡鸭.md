(Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 18) Chicken and duck breeding has developed rapidly in Guizhou Province. In the past four months, more than 15 million chickens and ducks have been bred. Adding to the original poultry, there are now an average of seven chickens and ducks per household.

Party organizations at all levels in Guizhou Province attach great importance to the development of poultry. Many county and commune party committees have a secretary or member specifically in charge of livestock and poultry production, helping commune members to solve various specific difficulties in developing and raising chickens and ducks in a timely manner. Generally, all localities seize the favorable conditions of having many mountains and grasses, and develop sources of poultry feed according to local conditions. For example, planting feed in front of and behind houses; digging pits to cultivate insects; cutting wild grass and vegetables into pieces and adding rice water or rice soup to ferment them, and then adding rice husks and bran to make refined feed to replace grain; driving chickens up the mountains and ducks into the water; or collecting large amounts of wild grass, chopping it up, boiling it, and feeding it to the chickens, etc.

    贵州农民大养鸡鸭
    据新华社贵阳18日电　贵州省家禽发展迅速。最近四个月来繁殖了鸡鸭一千五百多万只。加上原有家禽，现在平均每户已有鸡鸭七只。
    贵州省各级党组织对发展家禽很重视。许多县和公社党委，都有一位书记或委员专管家畜家禽生产，帮助社员及时解决发展喂养鸡鸭中的各种具体困难。各地一般都抓住山多草多这一有利条件，因地制宜地开辟家禽饲料来源。如在房前房后种植饲料；挖坑沤虫；用野草野菜切碎加上米水或米汤，使其发酵后，再加谷壳谷糠制成精饲料代替粮食；赶鸡上山，赶鸭下水；或者大量采集野草砍碎煮烂喂鸡等。
