Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th: Jiangsu's Suzhou Prefecture, located on the shores of Taihu Lake, has achieved an all-around bumper harvest this summer. The average per-mu yield of barley, wheat, and naked barley in the entire region increased by 40% compared to last year, the average per-mu yield of rapeseed increased by about 50%, broad beans increased by more than 30%, and green manure crops doubled. Economic crops and sideline production have also seen significant development. The total output of spring cocoons in the region increased by 14% compared to last year, spring tea increased by 64.4%, and white sand loquats from Dongting East Mountain of Taihu Lake increased eighteen-fold compared to last year. From January to June, the total fish output in the region increased by 55.7% compared to the same period last year. There are currently 1,078,800 live pigs, an increase of more than 80,000 heads since March after the Spring Festival. Poultry such as chickens, ducks, and geese have grown to 2,610,000, an increase of more than double compared to the same period last year. In addition, embroidery, lace, and other handicrafts, as well as small-scale industrial production, have also seen considerable development.

The people's commune system has provided extremely favorable conditions for the all-round leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. The all-around bumper harvest and great development of agricultural and sideline production in Suzhou Prefecture this summer is the result of the Suzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Party organizations at all levels, based on this favorable situation, leading the people's communes to focus on agriculture, giving overall consideration to various productions, making comprehensive arrangements, and vigorously carrying out high-yield movements.

In agricultural production, with the implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" as the center, attention was paid to ideological mobilization from beginning to end, and mass movements were vigorously carried out. Last autumn, the region first mobilized the masses to summarize the experiences of the 1958 Great Leap Forward, analyze the favorable conditions for continuing the leap forward this year, and criticized new conservative ideas such as "the increase in production of barley, wheat, and naked barley is limited" and "potential has been exhausted," thus launching a production upsurge to cultivate wheat well and strive for a rich summer harvest. After a hundred-thousand-person intensive campaign, the more than 2.8 million mu of wheat fields in the region were generally deeply ploughed to a depth of six to eight inches, with some areas deeply ploughed to more than one foot. All wheat fields were fertilized with base fertilizer, and the amount of fertilizer applied was doubled compared to the previous year. The seeding rate per mu of wheat field was also increased compared to the past, achieving rational close planting. During the field management process, the leadership also put forward the slogan "First-class seedlings ride the wind and waves, second-class seedlings do not give way, and third-class seedlings catch up from behind," and vigorously carried out appraisal competitions, which powerfully promoted the field management movement, ensuring that management did not stop until the wheat was brought to the threshing ground. Therefore, a situation of universal harvest emerged.

In terms of economic crops and sideline production, the entire region established a line of leadership from top to bottom, designating a secretary or member of the standing committee to be in charge of this work. For key projects, the leadership also guided the people's communes to establish specialized teams to strengthen operation and management. In the six counties, eighty communes, and eight hundred and fifty-six brigades in the region that engaged in sericulture, specialized sericulture production organizations were established. The production of forest products and special products in mountainous areas were also assigned to specific personnel, and the communes transferred more than 25,000 people to form specialized groups to manage them. In the arrangement of labor, all localities focused on agriculture, appropriately considered sideline production, and made flexible arrangements and interspersed them according to production needs. For example, when the intensive production of spring tea was needed, a portion of the labor force was drawn from water conservancy construction sites to participate in tea production.

In developing poultry and livestock, the source of piglets, chicks, ducklings, and goslings, as well as feed problems, were effectively solved. According to development plans, breeding bases were established at all levels, basically achieving self-breeding and self-raising. Communes, brigades, and production teams have pig farms for breeding piglets to supply the breeding needs of the commune and team. In order to massively breed poultry, in addition to each commune running hatcheries to hatch chicks and ducklings, the masses were also mobilized to hatch chicks. After adopting these methods, the number of seedlings and poultry in the region increased by 1.7 million in just over a month from April to May. At the same time, a mass movement to plant feed and collect substitute feed was launched throughout the region. At present, the region has planted more than 170,000 mu of various feeds such as sweet potatoes, corn, and pumpkins. The communes have also used lakes, ponds, and other water surfaces to plant large quantities of aquatic feeds such as water peanuts, water hyacinth, and water hyacinth.

With the all-around increase in agricultural and sideline production this summer, the income of commune members has also increased significantly this year. The commune members are all jubilant and praise this summer harvest as a "full house." Encouraged by the bumper summer harvest, the broad masses of the region are advancing victoriously, actively carrying out summer planting, strengthening field management of autumn-ripening crops, further developing sideline production, and striving for another all-around leap forward in autumn agricultural and sideline production.

    农业为主　统筹兼顾　全面安排 大搞丰产
    苏州专区农业副业满堂红
    三麦增产四成　油菜籽增产五成
    春茧增产14％　春茶增产64.4％
    鱼增产55.7％　枇杷增产十八倍
    养猪百万多头　鸡鸭超过二百万
    据新华社南京7日电　地处太湖之滨的江苏苏州专区，今年夏季获得全面大丰收。全区大麦、小麦、元麦平均亩产比去年增加四成，油菜籽平均亩产增加五成左右，蚕豆增加三成多，绿肥作物增加一倍。经济作物和副业生产也获得很大发展，全区春茧总产量比去年增加14％，春茶增加64.4％，太湖洞庭东山的白沙枇杷比去年增产十八倍。1月至6月份全区鱼的总产量比去年同期增加55.7％。生猪现有一百零七万八千头，比春节后的3月份增加八万多头，鸡鸭鹅等小家禽发展到二百六十一万只，比去年同期增长一倍以上。另外，刺绣、花边等手工艺和小手工业生产也有相当的发展。
    人民公社化为农林牧副渔全线大跃进提供了极为有利的条件。苏州专区今年夏季农副业全面大丰收，大发展，就是中共苏州地委和各级党组织，根据这一有利形势，领导各人民公社，以农业为主，对各项生产统筹兼顾全面安排，大搞丰产运动的结果。
    在农业生产方面，以贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”为中心，自始至终注意思想发动，大搞群众运动。去年秋种时，全区首先发动群众总结1958年跃进经验，分析今年继续跃进的有利条件，批判了“大麦、小麦、元麦增产有限”和“潜力已经挖尽”等新的保守思想，掀起了种好三麦力争夏熟丰收的生产高潮。经过一百万人的紧张突击，全区二百八十多万亩麦田，普遍深耕六寸到八寸，部分深翻一尺以上。全部麦田都施了基肥，施肥量比上年增加一倍。每亩麦田的下种量，也比以往增加，做到了合理密植。在田间管理过程中，领导上又提出了“一类苗乘风破浪，二类苗一步不让，三类苗迎头赶上”的口号，大搞评比竞赛，有力地推动了田间管理运动，做到了麦不上场，管理不停。因此，出现了处处丰收的局面。
    在经济作物和副业生产方面，全区从上到下建立了一条线的领导，确定一个书记或常委专管这方面的工作。对重点项目，还领导人民公社建立专业队伍，加强经营管理。全区有蚕桑的六个县八十个公社八百五十六个大队，都建立了蚕桑生产专业组织，山区林产、特产品的生产也都确定专人负责，各公社抽调了二万五千多人，组成专业组，专门经营。在劳力的安排上，各地都以农业为重点，适当照顾副业，并根据生产需要，灵活安排，穿插进行。例如采制春茶时需要突击，就从水利工地上抽回了一部分劳力参加制茶。
    在发展禽畜方面，切实地解决了仔猪和小鸡小鸭小鹅的来源和饲料问题。各地根据发展计划，层层建立了种苗繁殖基地，基本上做到了自繁自养。公社、大队和生产队有繁殖仔猪的种猪场，以供应本社本队繁殖需要。为了大量繁殖家禽，除每个公社都办孵坊孵小鸡小鸭外，还发动群众孵化小鸡。采取这些办法后，仅4月到5月的一个多月内，全区苗禽就增加一百七十万只。同时全区开展了群众性的种植饲料和收集代用饲料的运动。目前，全区已种甘薯、玉米、南瓜等各种饲料十七万多亩。各公社还利用湖、泊、池塘等水面种了大批水花生、水浮莲、水葫芦等水生饲料。
    随着夏季农副业生产的全面增产，今年夏季社员的收入也有很大增长。社员们都欢欣鼓舞，称颂今年夏收是“满堂红”。全区广大群众在夏季大丰收的鼓舞下，正在乘胜前进，积极搞好夏种，加强秋熟作物的田间管理，进一步发展副业，争取秋季农副业生产再来一个全面跃进。（附图片）
