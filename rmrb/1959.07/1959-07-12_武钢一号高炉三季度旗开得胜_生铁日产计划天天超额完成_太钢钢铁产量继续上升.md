Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 10th. From July 1st to 8th, the Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 blast furnace exceeded its daily pig iron production plan every day, with an average daily output of one hundred tons more than in the second quarter. The ironworkers are continuing to exert their efforts, determined to gradually increase the daily pig iron production in the third quarter and greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day with outstanding production achievements.

	At the end of June, Wuhan Iron and Steel's Ironmaking Plant held a special meeting to study the safe operation and high-quality, high-yield of the No. 1 blast furnace. With the help of Soviet ironmaking expert Sherbakov, they adopted many technical measures, including stabilizing furnace conditions, improving gas distribution at the furnace top, stabilizing the alkalinity of the slag, improving the fluidity of the slag, discharging iron and slag on time, and improving the furnace top material distribution. The No. 1 blast furnace also held continuous production meetings, furnace front worker meetings, etc., to carefully study specific methods for implementing these measures. The mud grinding workers improved the quality of the mud grinding machine, making the mud uniform in precision and stable in moisture, overcoming the shortcomings of the iron tap being damp. The furnace front workers ensured frequent tapping and plugging, discharging iron and slag on time, ensuring the smooth operation of the blast furnace. The coking plant and Daye Iron Mine also improved the quality of coke and ore, which also played a significant role in increasing blast furnace production.

	Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 11th. Since the beginning of the third quarter, the steel production of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has continued to gradually rise. From July 1st to 8th, the output of steel products increased by more than 400 tons compared with the same period last month, and the output of steel and iron also increased.

	In the first half of this year, the output of pig iron, steel, and steel products of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company all greatly increased compared with the same period last year, and the quality of steel in particular improved more significantly than in the second half of last year. However, the production plan for the second half of this year is much higher than in the first half, with steel increasing by 16% and steel products increasing by 21%. In order to ensure the completion of this heavy task, the employees of all units of the company are working from various aspects to strengthen the weak links in production. A number of technical transformation projects that play a decisive role in improving production are also being accelerated.

	One of the keys to increasing steel production is to shorten the smelting time of open-hearth furnaces. After analyzing the reasons for the long cold repair time, long smelting time, and insufficient furnace maintenance, the workers of the steelmaking plant adopted various methods to improve them. At present, the smelting time of some open-hearth furnaces has been gradually shortened furnace by furnace. In the past few days, the average time for smelting one furnace of steel in the No. 3 open-hearth furnace has been shortened from 13 hours and 48 minutes to 12 hours and 5 minutes.

    武钢一号高炉三季度旗开得胜
    生铁日产计划天天超额完成
    太钢钢铁产量继续上升
    新华社武汉10日电　武钢一号高炉从7月1日至8日天天超额完成生铁日产计划，每天平均比第二季度时多产铁一百吨。炼铁工人们正继续鼓足干劲，决心在第三季度使生铁日产量再逐步提高，以出色的生产成就迎接国庆十周年。
    武钢炼铁厂6月底就召开专门会议研究有关一号高炉安全运转、优质高产的问题。他们在苏联炼铁专家谢尔柏柯夫的帮助下，采取了许多技术措施，其中包括稳定炉况、改善炉顶煤气分布、稳定炉渣的碱度、改善渣子的流动性、按时出铁出渣、改进炉顶布料情况等等。一号高炉也连续召开生产会议，炉前工会议等，细致研究了实现这些措施的具体办法。碾泥工改进了碾泥机的质量，使泥的精度均匀，水分稳定，克服了铁口潮的缺点，炉前工做到了勤放勤堵，按时出铁出渣，保证高炉顺行。炼焦厂和大冶铁矿分别改进焦炭和矿石的质量，也对高炉增产起了很大作用。
    新华社太原11日电　进入第三季度以来，太原钢铁公司的钢铁生产在继续地逐步上升。7月1日至8日的钢材产量，比上月同期增加了四百多吨，钢和铁的产量也都有所提高。
    太原钢铁公司今年上半年的生铁、钢、钢材的产量都比去年同期大有提高，特别是钢的质量比去年下半年提高得更为显著。但是今年下半年的生产计划比上半年又提高很多，如钢提高16％，钢材提高21％。为了保证完成这一繁重的任务，公司各单位的职工正在从多方面着手，加强生产中的薄弱环节。一些对提高生产起决定作用的几项技术改造工程，也在同时加紧进行。
    提高钢产量的关键之一，是缩短平炉的冶炼时间。炼钢厂的职工分析了平炉冷修时间长、冶炼时间长和炉子维护不够好的原因以后，采用各种办法加以改进。目前有些平炉的冶炼时间已逐炉缩短。三号平炉在最近几天内，平均每炼一炉钢的时间已由十三小时四十八分缩短到十二小时零五分。
