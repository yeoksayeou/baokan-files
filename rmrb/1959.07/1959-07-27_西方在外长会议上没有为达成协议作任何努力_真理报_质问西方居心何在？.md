Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 26th: TASS Moscow, July 26th - "Pravda" wrote in a commentary on the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference that the situation in the second stage of the conference over the past two weeks convincingly demonstrates an obvious fact: Western countries are unwilling and afraid to hold any form of negotiations between Germans to discuss the issues of preparing a peace treaty with Germany, restoring German unity, and contact between the two Germanys, as suggested by the Soviet delegation.

"Pravda" went on to write that, as everyone knows, Western countries have made no effort to facilitate an agreement on the Berlin issue. "Pravda" pointed out that, under these circumstances, there is every reason to ask the question: Why did Western countries come to the Geneva Conference at all? Is it only to show that they agree with the policy of undermining international cooperation pursued by the West German Chancellor?

"Pravda" emphasized that the actual situation at the Geneva Conference thoroughly exposed the complete hypocrisy of Western countries' policy on the German question. Their policy shows that they are completely unconcerned with easing international tensions.

People from the Western delegations attending the conference talked a lot about so-called "paying the price" for a summit meeting on the Soviet side. "Pravda" pointed out that if we are to use this business-like terminology, then it should be said that it is not the Soviet Union, but the West that should "pay the price" for participating in such a meeting. The West should not go to the summit empty-handed. Simply arguing in Geneva, and continuing to pursue a policy of maintaining tension in the future, cannot be considered "paying the price" for a summit meeting.

    西方在外长会议上没有为达成协议作任何努力
    “真理报”质问西方居心何在？
    据新华社26日讯　塔斯社莫斯科26日讯：“真理报”在评论日内瓦外长会议时写道，会议第二阶段的两周情况令人信服地表明了一个明显的事实：西方国家不愿意而且害怕德国人之间举行任何形式的谈判，来讨论苏联代表团所建议的准备对德和约、恢复德国统一和两个德国接触的问题。
    “真理报”接着写道，大家知道，西方国家在柏林问题上并没有作任何努力来促进达成协议。“真理报”指出，在这种情况下，完全有理由提出这样一个问题：西方国家到底为什么来参加日内瓦会议呢？难道只是为了来表明它们同意西德总理所执行的破坏国际合作的政策吗？
    “真理报”强调指出，日内瓦会议的实际情况彻底揭露了西方国家对德国问题的政策的全部虚伪性。它们的政策表明，它们完全不关心缓和国际紧张局势。
    出席会议的西方代表团人士大谈所谓苏联应该对最高级会谈“付出代价”。“真理报”指出，如果要使用这种做生意的术语的话，那么，应该说不是苏联，而是西方应当对参加这种会谈“付出代价”。西方不应空手去参加最高级会议。单是在日内瓦辩论，而今后还要继续执行保持紧张局势的政策，不能算是为最高级会议“付出代价”。
