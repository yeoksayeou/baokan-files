Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 28th: The "Chollima Work Team" movement, which began among North Korean workers this spring, is spreading widely. To date, thirty-two work teams in various regions and industries have earned the glorious title of "Chollima Work Team."

In early July, twenty-nine work teams had already received this title. These work teams include the team led by the famous labor hero and steel worker An Sang-jo of the Chongjin Steel Mill, the Kim Chil-sang work team of the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, and work teams from heavy and light industrial enterprises such as coal mines, machine factories, and textile mills.

The achievements of the Lee Seong-sil work team of the Pyongyang Textile Machinery Factory, which received the glorious title of "Chollima Work Team" on July 13th, are particularly outstanding. Since April of this year, this work team has overfulfilled its production plan by more than 100% for three consecutive months; during this period, the work team increased labor productivity by 76%. By June 29th of this year, the work team had completed its entire year's production plan six months ahead of schedule. In the "all-rounder" movement, the technicians and apprentices of this work team formed mutual aid groups, and in a short period of time, everyone learned the technology to operate two types of machine tools. They also put forward rationalization proposals that doubled the speed of cutting gears, greatly reducing defective products.

The Kim Yong-se work team of the Yumping Forestry Production Enterprise in Ryanggang Province, which won the title of "Chollima Work Team" in May, proposed at the end of May to complete their logging plan in the first Five-Year Plan in two years and seven months. Thanks to the communist spirit of cooperation displayed by the loggers and transporters of this work team, and the creation of a new sawing method, the average amount of wood felled per person per day increased from ten cubic meters to twenty-one to thirty cubic meters. Wood transport efficiency also doubled compared to last year. Workers also participated in technical lectures and adult schools to comprehensively improve their technical and cultural levels.

    朝鲜广大职工鼓足干劲  争取“千里马作业班”称号
    新华社平壤28日电　朝鲜工人从今年春天开始的“千里马作业班”运动正在广泛地展开。到现在为止，各地各行业中已经有三十二个作业班获得“千里马作业班”的光荣称号。
    在7月上旬，有二十九个作业班获得了这个称号。这些作业班包括：城津炼钢厂著名的劳动英雄、炼钢工人安尚祚领导的作业班和兴南肥料工厂的金七相作业班，以及煤矿、机械厂、纺织厂等重工业和轻工业企业的作业班。
    在7月13日获得“千里马作业班”这个光荣称号的平壤纺织机械制造厂李圣实作业班的事迹是比较突出的。这个作业班从今年4月以来，连续三个月都超额一倍以上完成了生产计划；在这个期间，这个作业班提高了劳动生产率76％。这个作业班到今年6月29日已经提前半年完成了今年全年的生产计划。在“多面手”运动中，这个作业班的技工和徒工组成了互助组，在短时间内每个人都学会了操作两种机床的技术。他们还提出了合理化建议，使切削齿轮的速度提高了一倍，大大减少了废品。
    5月间获得“千里马作业班”称号的两江道榆坪林产事业所金容世作业班，在今年5月底就提出用两年零七个月的时间来完成他们在第一个五年计划中的伐木计划。由于这个作业班的伐木工和搬运工发挥了共产主义的协作精神，并且创造了新的锯木法，结果由平均每人每天伐木十立方提高到二十一三十立方。运木效率也比去年提高了一倍。工人们还都参加了技术讲学班和成人学校，来全面地提高他们的技术和文化水平。
