    In Disaster Areas, Eradicate the Calamity After Autumn or This Winter!
    Currently, the national summer harvest has been completed, and most areas have achieved a bumper harvest. However, some areas have been hit by floods, droughts, typhoons, and other disasters. Severe natural disasters have caused varying degrees of difficulty for production and the lives of the masses. In this season of frequent disasters, whether areas have already been affected or not, they should maintain a high degree of vigilance, and with the belief and determination that “man will conquer nature,” continue to fight against possible disasters, ensuring a bumper harvest in autumn agricultural production. Areas that have already been affected should take active steps to lead the masses to eliminate the difficulties caused by the disaster as soon as possible, striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture.
    We have many favorable conditions to overcome the disaster: We have the leadership of the Party and the support of the government; the people's communes have been consolidated and strengthened after rectification; most areas have had a bumper summer harvest this year, and only local areas have been affected by disasters; the vast number of cadres and the masses have rich experience in fighting against disasters over the years, and so on. All of this is a reliable guarantee for overcoming the disaster. Disaster areas must be good at leveraging and utilizing these favorable conditions, launching a magnificent production-to-overcome-the-disaster campaign among the masses. After the Dongjiang area of Guangdong Province was hit by the disaster, the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee led a large number of cadres to the disaster area to express their condolences; at the same time, they vigorously carried out propaganda and organizational work among the masses, putting forward a resounding call, demanding that the cadres and masses in the disaster area be determined, have ambition, strive for a bumper harvest in the late rice crop, recover the losses from the early rice crop disaster, and strive to change the face of the disaster area completely after a few months of hard work, eliminating the traces left by the flood. This approach is very good, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm and drive of the masses in the disaster area to overcome the disaster.
    The fundamental way to overcome the disaster is to vigorously promote production. "Self-reliance through production" is the basic principle of the Party's disaster relief work. Years of experience have proven that this is the only correct principle. In order to implement this principle, disaster areas need to take some measures suitable for the characteristics of the region to grasp production. Disaster areas in Tangshan, Shijiazhuang and other areas of Hebei Province have put forward the slogan "Lose in summer, find in autumn; lose in early autumn, find in late autumn; lose grain, find vegetables; lose agriculture, find sideline occupations." This is a very good slogan, it tells us that in areas where summer crops have been hit by disasters, the losses from the summer disasters should be recovered from the autumn crops. In areas where early autumn crops have been hit by disasters, the losses from the early autumn disasters should be compensated for by doing a good job in late autumn crops and planting a variety of early-maturing and high-yielding crops. In order to achieve this goal smoothly, in addition to doing a good job in collective agricultural production, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to plant more melons and vegetables by using the gaps beside houses and fields; and to vigorously develop sideline production without affecting the completion of agricultural production tasks. Over the years, disaster areas have relied on sideline production to solve most of the masses' living difficulties, and this link should still be grasped this year. When developing sideline production, it is necessary to adhere to the Party's policies, ensuring that communes, production teams, and members work together, rationally dividing the scope of sideline business, and engaging in both self-sufficient sideline production and commercial sideline production in order to strive for greater income. In order to fully develop agricultural and sideline production, doing a good job in labor arrangement is a key issue. Some counties in Henan Province have adopted the method of: first, meeting the labor force required for agriculture, while fixing a part of the labor force to engage in sideline production regularly; and seizing the opportunity to organize planned crash sideline production. In this way, the combination of professional teams and mass production, the combination of regular production and crash production, will not affect agriculture, but also obtain a large number of sideline income. For the difficulties existing in agricultural and sideline production in disaster areas, such as the problem of seeds for replanting and changing planting, the problem of replenishing draught animals and farm implements, the problem of allocating sideline raw materials, the problem of insufficient funds, the problem of product procurement, etc., the economic departments need to solve them in a planned way.
    In disaster relief work, we must first guarantee the lives of the masses and solve the problem of food and shelter for the masses. In disaster areas, the necessary rations for the masses must be transferred and supplied in a timely manner. Each disaster area must explain the arrangement of grain and the amount of fixed sales to the masses so that everyone has a clear understanding. It is necessary to educate the masses to use grain in a planned and economical way, quantifying it by person, eating more when busy and less when idle, eating dry when busy and half-dry and half-thin when idle, mixed with sweet potatoes, vegetables, radishes, melons, beans, taro and the like. The canteens in the disaster area should strive to do a good job, which is of great significance for arranging the lives of the masses and saving them from disaster. The problem of housing should be solved step by step. At present, we can use borrowing or build some temporary housing so that the masses can settle down in order to carry out production. After the busy farming season, we will organize labor to repair houses in large quantities and rebuild our homes. The problem of lack of clothing and bedding for individual disaster-stricken people should be solved appropriately through commune subsidies, mutual assistance among the masses, and government support. For epidemics caused by disasters, we must vigorously organize medical personnel to treat them and increase the nutrition of patients in order to put them out in a timely manner.
    Production and disaster relief work is arduous and complicated. It must be started as soon as possible and arranged in a unified manner under the unified leadership of the Party committee. The first step should be to find out the actual situation of the disaster. How much difficulty has the disaster brought? How big is the disaster relief task? What measures should be taken to overcome the disaster? Only after these situations are clarified can we make a realistic and comprehensive plan. In the arrangement of work, we should implement the Party's policy of "grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other." However, in specific practice, it is also necessary to distinguish priorities and grab them step by step. After the disaster, the difficulties in food and shelter for the masses urgently need to be solved, so we should first arrange the lives of the masses in order to make the masses feel at ease to engage in production. After the lives of the masses have been initially settled, we must vigorously engage in production. In short, production and life are closely related and promote each other, and there can be no neglect. In production and disaster relief, we must properly coordinate the strength of the collective, the individual, and the country. Overcoming the disaster mainly depends on the strength of the masses and the collective, and giving full play to the great superiority of the people's commune. However, the enthusiasm of each person should also be fully mobilized to solve some difficulties that they can solve on their own. For those communes that have been hit by disasters more seriously or have a poor economic foundation, government relief and support are still indispensable. Other issues, such as how to combine the supply of materials and the investment of various funds in the disaster area, are also issues that deserve special attention. In some places, the relief subsidies for food, coal, and medicine for the disaster-stricken people are respectively contracted with the grain, commercial, and health departments, and the civil affairs and finance departments allocate funds, and the relevant departments are responsible for allocating physical objects, which is more appropriate, and all localities can follow suit and create better methods.
    After the disaster relief work in the disaster area is deployed, the leading organs at all levels must organize forces to go deep into the disaster area to understand the implementation of various disaster relief policies and relief measures, such as whether the production and disaster relief plan is practical and reliable, whether the masses eat grain according to the quantitative, whether the relief funds and loans have played their due role, etc., and if problems are found, they must be solved immediately in order to avoid losses that could have been avoided. In relief and support, priority should be given to areas that have been hit by disasters more severely, especially communities and teams with poor economic foundations, and these areas should also be the focus of work supervision and assistance, so that the disaster situation in these areas can be changed rapidly.
    The key to overcoming the disaster is to strengthen the leadership of the Party and closely rely on the masses. "Thousands of articles, the Party's leadership is the first; thousands of plans, the mass line is the first plan." All major work in the disaster area should be centralized and unified under the leadership of the Party committee. The relevant departments of the government should cooperate closely and work together to serve production and disaster relief. It is necessary for severely affected areas to re-establish specialized production and disaster relief institutions, with the Party secretary personally taking charge, coordinating and directing all work. Cadres at all levels in the disaster area should carry forward the spirit of caring about the suffering of the masses and being highly responsible to the Party and the people, and at the same time, they should resolutely implement the mass line, go deep into the grassroots, mobilize the masses, and jointly discuss and implement various disaster relief measures, so that self-reliance through production and economical disaster relief become the conscious actions of the broad masses. We believe that under the leadership and care of the Party and the government, and relying on the hard work of the vast number of cadres and the masses, the disaster in local areas this year will definitely be overcome. Our slogan is: "Eradicate the calamity after autumn or this winter!"

    受灾地区，要把灾荒消灭在秋后或今冬！
    目前，全国夏收作物已经收割完毕，绝大部分地区获得了丰收。但是，也有少部分地区遭受了洪水、干旱、台风等灾害的袭击。自然灾害严重的地区，给生产和群众生活造成了不同程度的困难。当此灾害频繁的季节，不论已受灾的或未受灾的地区，都应当保持高度的警惕，抱定
  “人定胜天”的信心和决心，继续与可能发生的灾害作斗争，确保秋季农业生产的大丰收。已经受灾的地区，更要积极行动起来，领导群众尽快消除灾害造成的困难，力争农业上的丰收。
    我们有很多有利的条件战胜灾荒：我们有党的领导，政府的支持；人民公社经过了整顿，更加巩固和强大；今年大部地区夏季丰收，遭灾的只是局部地区；广大干部和群众历年与灾害作斗争，有着丰富的经验，等等。这一切，都是战胜灾荒的可靠保证。受灾地区要善于发挥和运用这些有利条件，在群众中展开一个气势宏伟的生产渡荒运动。广东省东江地区受灾以后，省委和省人委的负责同志，一面率领大批干部，亲赴灾区慰问；一面在群众中大力开展宣传工作和组织工作，提出了响亮的号召，要求灾区干部和群众，下决心，长志气，争取晚造特大丰收，夺回早造受灾的损失，争取苦战几个月，在秋后或年底全部改变灾区面貌，消灭水灾留下的痕迹。这种作法很好，大大鼓舞了灾区群众战胜灾荒的热情和干劲。
    战胜灾荒的根本办法在于大抓生产。“生产自救”是党在救灾工作中的基本方针。历年来的经验已经证明，这是唯一正确的方针。为了贯彻这一方针，受灾地区，需要采取一些适合本地区特点的措施，抓好生产。河北省唐山、石家庄等专区的受灾地区提出了“夏季丢、秋季找，早秋丢、晚秋找，粮食丢、蔬菜找，农业丢、副业找”的口号。这是一个很好的口号，它告诉我们：在夏季作物遭灾的地区，应当从搞好秋季作物中，把夏季受灾的损失捞回来。早秋作物受灾的地区，应当从搞好晚秋作物和多种早熟多产的作物中，把早秋受灾的损失补起来。为了顺利地达到这个目的，除了搞好集体的农业生产以外，还要发动群众，利用宅旁、田边的空隙地，多多种植瓜菜；在不影响完成农业生产任务的前提下，大力开展副业生产。历年来，受灾地区靠副业生产解决了大部分群众的生活困难，今年仍应抓紧这一环。在开展副业生产的时候，必须根据党的政策，做到公社、生产队、社员一齐动手，合理地划分副业经营的范围，既要搞自给性的副业生产，也要搞商品性的副业生产，以争取更大的收入。为了使农副业生产都能得到充分的开展，搞好劳动力的安排是一个关键问题，河南省有些县采取的办法是：首先满足农业所需的劳动力，同时固定一部分劳动力经常从事副业生产；并且抓住火候，有计划地组织突击性的副业生产。这样，使专业队和群众性的生产相结合，经常性的生产和突击性的生产相结合，既不影响农业，又能取得大批副业收入。对于灾区农副业生产中存在的困难，如补种改种的种籽问题、耕畜农具的补充问题、副业原料的调配问题、资金不足问题、产品收购问题等等，都需要经济部门有计划地加以解决。
    救灾工作中，首先应当保障群众的生活，解决好群众的吃和住的问题。受灾地区，对群众必需的口粮，要及时调运，保证供应。各个灾区要把粮食的安排、定销的数量，向群众讲清楚，使大家心中有底。要教育群众有计划地节约用粮，按人定量，忙时多吃，闲时少吃，忙时吃干，闲时半干半稀，杂以番薯、青菜、萝卜、瓜豆、芋头之类。灾区的食堂应当努力办好，办好了对安排群众生活、节约渡荒都有重要意义。对于住的问题，应当有步骤地解决。目前可以利用借住，或搭盖一些临时住所，使群众都能安身，以便进行生产。等农忙过去后，再组织劳力，大量修复房屋，重整家园。对个别灾区群众缺乏衣被的问题，应当通过公社补助、群众互济和政府扶持的办法，求得适当的解决。因灾引起的疫病，要大力组织医务人员进行治疗，并增加病人的营养，以求及时扑灭。
    生产救灾工作是繁重复杂的，必须在党委统一领导下，及早动手，统筹安排。第一步应该先摸清灾荒的实际情况。灾害带来多大困难？救灾任务有多大？采取什么措施才能渡过灾荒？这些情况摸清了，才好做出切合实际的全面规划。在工作安排上，应当贯彻党的“一手抓生产、一手抓生活”的方针。但在具体实践中，还要分清轻重缓急，有步骤的去抓。遭灾之后，群众吃和住的困难，迫切需要解决，这就应当先把群众的生活安排好，才能使群众安心从事生产。群众的生活得到初步安置以后，就要大搞生产。总之，生产与生活，是密切相关、互为推动的，不可有一点忽视。在生产救灾中，要把集体、个人和国家的力量恰当的配合起来。战胜灾荒主要靠群众集体的力量，发挥人民公社的巨大优越性。但是，每个人的积极性也应当充分调动起来，解决一些自身可以解决的困难。对那些受灾较重的公社或者经济基础较差的社或队，政府的救济和扶持仍是不可缺少的。其他如灾区的物资供应和各种款项的投放如何结合，也是一个值得特别注意的问题。有的地方，对受灾群众口粮、煤炭、医药的救济补助，分别采取与粮食、商业、卫生等部门订立合同，由民政、财政部门拨款，有关部门负责调拨实物的办法，是比较恰当的，各地可以仿效，还可创造更好的办法。
    灾区各项工作布置下去以后，各级领导机关必须组织力量深入灾区，了解各项救灾政策和救济措施的贯彻执行情况，如生产救灾规划是否切实可靠，群众是否按定量吃到粮食，救济款、贷款是否起到了应有的作用等等，发现问题要立即解决，以免造成原来可以避免的损失。在救济扶持中，应当优先照顾受灾较重的地区特别是经济基础较差的社队，而在工作的督促检查和帮助上，也要以这些地区为重点，使这些地区的灾荒面貌能够得到迅速改变。
    战胜灾荒的关键，是加强党的领导和紧密依靠群众。“千条万条，党的领导是第一条；千计万计，群众路线是第一计”。灾区的一切重大工作，都应当集中统一在党委的领导下进行。政府的有关部门应当密切配合，通力协作，为生产救灾服务。重灾地区有必要把生产救灾的专门机构重新建立起来，党委书记亲自挂帅，统筹安排和指挥各项工作。灾区的各级干部，应当发扬关心群众疾苦、对党对人民高度负责的精神，同时应当坚决贯彻群众路线，深入基层，发动群众，共同讨论与执行救灾的各项措施，使生产自救、节约渡荒变成广大群众的自觉行动。我们相信，受灾地区在党和政府的领导关怀下，依靠广大干部和群众的辛勤努力，今年局部地区的灾荒是一定能够战胜的。我们的口号是：“把灾荒消灭在秋后或今冬！”
