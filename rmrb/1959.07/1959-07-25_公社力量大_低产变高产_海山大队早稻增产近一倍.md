Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd. The Haishan Brigade of the Fugong Commune in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, transformed from a low-yield area to a high-yield area in its first summer harvest after communization. After harvesting, threshing, drying, and cleaning, and after the commune’s acceptance and weighing, the average per-mu yield of more than 270 mu of early rice in the entire brigade was 605 jin, an increase of more than 90% compared to last year, and 5 jin more than the originally planned per-mu target.

The Haishan Brigade is located on Haimen Island outside Fugong Port. The land is barren and the water conservancy conditions are very poor. Before liberation, the 250 households on the island lived in poverty. After liberation, although production has developed greatly, it is still one of the lowest-yielding areas in the county.

In order to change the low-yield situation, since the end of last autumn harvest, under the unified leadership of the commune, the members of the entire brigade have successively excavated more than 140,000 cubic meters of earth and stone before the spring plowing, and newly built 82 water conservancy projects such as water storage and diversion, so that the island's 1,200 mu of cultivated land is free from the threat of drought, and the drought resistance capacity reaches 70 days. Although there were several periods of prolonged drought after the early rice transplanting, all rice fields still had enough water for irrigation. In addition, by conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production increase and other production increase measures, a bumper harvest of early rice was finally achieved.

### 公社力量大　低产变高产  海山大队早稻增产近一倍

    公社力量大　低产变高产
    海山大队早稻增产近一倍
    新华社福州23日电　福建海澄县浮宫公社海山大队在公社化后的第一个夏收中，由低产地区变为高产地区。全大队二百七十多亩早稻经过收打、晒干扬净和由公社验收过秤以后，平均亩产六百零五斤，比去年增加九成以上，比原订的亩产指标多了五斤。
    海山大队地处浮宫港外的海门岛上，土地瘠薄、水利条件很差，全岛二百五十户居民，解放前一直过着贫困生活。解放后，生产虽然获得很大发展，但仍然是全县产量最低地区之一。
    为了改变低产面貌，从去年秋收结束以来，全队社员在公社统一领导下，在春耕前先后挖掘土石方十四万多公方，新修了八十二处蓄水和引水等水利工程，使岛上一千二百亩耕地免受旱灾威胁，抗旱能力达到七十天。在早稻插秧后虽然数次遇到久晴不雨的天气，但所有稻田仍有足够的水灌溉，再加上认真实行农业增产“八字宪法”其他增产措施，终于实现了早稻大丰收。
