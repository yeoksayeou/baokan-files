Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th – By promoting the thirty-six advanced experiences proposed by the Ministry of Coal Industry, Fuxin Coal Mine has powerfully promoted a large-scale bumper harvest movement in various mines and mining sections throughout the mining area. The average daily coal production level in the first half of July increased by 22.81% compared to the first half of June; the number of coal mining sections achieving bumper harvests and high-yield bumper harvests has increased from six in June to ten.

Due to the conscientious promotion of advanced experiences in roof management, parallel mining (coal) and filling (backfilling) operations, and rapid conveyor shifting, the Second Pit of Ping'an Mine has greatly shortened the coal mining cycle time and has achieved high-yield bumper harvest levels every month since March. After promoting experiences such as long drill-bit drilling, multiple blasting in one go, and dedicated conveyor operators, the Second Coal Mining Section of the First Pit of Xinqiu Mine achieved an average daily raw coal production of 710 tons in early July, far exceeding the high-yield bumper harvest standard of 600 tons per day stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry. After studying the advanced experiences of the Communist Youth League electric shovel at Xinqiu North Open-Pit Mine and the No. 121 electric shovel at Haizhou Open-Pit Mine, the electric shovel operators at various open-pit mines have achieved an average monthly stripping volume of over 30,000 cubic meters per cubic meter of electric shovel bucket, reaching the electric shovel stripping standard for large-scale bumper harvests in open-pit mines stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry.

Since April of this year, Fuxin Coal Mine has organized all employees to conscientiously study the thirty-six advanced experiences proposed by the Ministry of Coal Industry and, from the bottom up, combined with the specific conditions of their respective units, formulated a "four-determination" plan for promoting these advanced experiences, implementing fixed points (working faces), fixed times, fixed personnel (dedicated personnel in charge), and fixed results. In order to strengthen organizational leadership, the entire mine has also established a three-level reporting system at the bureau, mine, and pit levels, regularly checking the promotion status of each unit. Due to the conscientious promotion of advanced experiences, not only is current production guaranteed, but various units have also created and developed many new experiences. After the Third Coal Mining Section of the Fifth Pit of Ping'an Mine successfully tested simple hydraulic coal transportation in a thin coal seam working face, it produced 5,612 tons of raw coal in the first half of July, reaching the high-yield bumper harvest level for medium-thick coal seams. The Second Pit of Ping'an Mine used yellow mud grouting on wooden plank false-roof working faces, which not only avoided fires but also, due to the strong adhesion of the yellow mud, was able to bond falling rocks into a whole, solving the problem of difficult control of broken roofs and effectively ensuring safe production.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st – Fuxin Station continues to strengthen cooperation with the coal mine, transporting large quantities of coal in a timely manner, basically ensuring that raw coal does not touch the ground.

In the production increase and economy movement at Fuxin Coal Mine, coal production is rising daily. In order to transport the large amount of raw coal produced by the coal mine in a timely manner, the employees of Fuxin Station also launched a competition to "get more cars from time and improve efficiency through cooperation" to load and transport coal quickly. From July 1st to 15th, they transported 8,821 cars of coal, totaling more than 370,000 tons, with an average daily departure of 588 cars, an increase of 10.6% compared to the same period in June; the average time for a single operation in the first half of July was 6.4 hours, also 1.2 hours shorter than the same period last month.

"The railway will transport as much coal as the coal mine produces" is the common slogan of the employees of Fuxin Station. Starting from the beginning of the month, based on summarizing and consolidating past experiences, they rationally adjusted the labor organization and promoted practices such as "inspecting while loading" to improve work efficiency, thereby greatly shortening the vehicle dwell time. In order to tap more vehicles for coal transportation, the employees also launched a car unloading competition. According to statistics from July 1st to 10th, their average car unloading time reached 3.20 minutes, 1.22 minutes shorter than the same period in June.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st – An advanced experience observation and dissemination team formed by the Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Committee of the China Coal Mine Trade Union will, starting today, go to coal mines in Shandong, Henan, Shanxi and other provinces to observe, disseminate and exchange advanced experiences.

The task of the advanced experience observation and dissemination team is to further promote the thirty-six main advanced experiences stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry for promotion this year, focusing on several important links in current coal mine production. The content of these advanced experiences includes: comprehensively improving on-site production management, strengthening tunneling, saving pit timber, reducing electric conveyor accidents, and ensuring safe production. Vigorously promoting these aspects of experience will powerfully promote the in-depth development of the coal industry's large-scale bumper harvest movement, to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's coal production tasks.

The members of this advanced experience observation and dissemination team are mostly advanced producers and representatives of advanced units. After arriving at coal mines in various places, they will adopt methods such as on-site visits, oral introductions, and on-site demonstrations, combining dissemination, observation, and learning.

On July 20th, Xu Zhizhen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Liu Xiangsan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Coal Industry, met with the advanced producers participating in the advanced experience observation and dissemination team, encouraging them to not only disseminate their own experiences well but also to study the experiences of brother units well, so as to learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, improve together, and actively and deeply carry out the production increase and economy movement, and produce more and better coal for the country.

    认真推广先进经验积极加强路矿协作
    阜新煤矿多采快运
    煤炭工业部和煤矿工会派出先进经验观摩队促进增产节约运动
    新华社沈阳20日电　阜新煤矿通过推广煤炭工业部提出的三十六项先进经验，有力地推动了全矿区各矿各采煤段大面积丰产运动。7月上半月的煤炭日产水平，比6月上半月提高了22.81％；丰产和高额丰产的采煤段，已经由6月份的六个，增加到十个。
    平安矿二坑由于认真推广了顶板管理、采（煤）充（填）平行作业、快速移溜子等先进经验，大大缩短了采煤循环时间，3月以来月月达到高额丰产的水平。新丘矿一坑第二采煤段，推广长钎子打眼、一次多放炮、溜子专人负责等经验后，7月上旬日产原煤平均达到了七百一十吨，大大超过了煤炭工业部规定的日产六百吨的高额丰产标准。各露天矿的电铲司机，学习了新丘北露天矿共青团号电铲、海州露天矿一百二十一号电铲的先进经验后，平均每立方米电铲勺斗的月剥离量，已经超过三万立方米，达到了煤炭工业部规定的露天矿大面积丰产局的电铲剥离标准。
    阜新煤矿从今年4月份起，就组织全体职工认真学习了煤炭工业部提出的三十六项先进经验，并且自下而上的结合本单位的具体条件，制订了推广这些先进经验的“四定”方案，实行定点
  （工作面）、定时、定人（专人负责）、定效果。为了加强组织领导，全矿还建立了局、矿、坑三级汇报制度，定期检查各单位推广情况。由于认真推广先进经验，不但保证了当前生产，各个单位还创造和发展了许多新经验。平安矿五坑第三采煤段在薄煤层工作面试验成功简易水力运煤后，7月上半月生产了原煤五千六百一十二吨，达到了中厚煤层高额丰产水平。平安矿二坑在木板假顶工作面上采用黄泥灌浆，不但避免了发火，而且由于黄泥的粘结性强，能把落石结成整体，解决了顶板破碎不易控制的问题，有效地保证了安全生产。
    新华社沈阳21日电　阜新车站继续加强同煤矿的协作，把大量煤炭及时运出，基本上做到了不让原煤落地。
    阜新煤矿在增产节约运动中，煤炭产量逐日上升。为了把煤矿增产的大量原煤及时运出，阜新车站职工也展开了向时间要车、向协作要效率的多装煤快运煤的竞赛。7月1日至15日，他们运出了煤炭八千八百二十一车共三十七万多吨，平均日发车量达到五百八十八车，比6月份同时期的发车数提高10.6％；7月上半月一次作业时间平均是六·四小时，也比上月同期缩短一·二小时。
      “煤矿生产多少煤，铁路就运走多少煤”，这是阜新车站职工共同的行动口号。从月初开始，他们在总结与巩固过去经验的基础上，合理地调整了劳动组织，并且推行了随装随检等提高工作效率的做法，从而使车辆停留时间大大缩短。为了挖掘更多的车辆装运煤炭，职工们还掀起了卸车竞赛。据7月1日到10日的统计，他们的平均卸车时间达到了三·二○分钟，比6月份同期缩短一·二二分钟。
    新华社21日讯　煤炭工业部和中国煤矿工会全国委员会组成的一个先进经验观摩传播队，从今天起先后赴山东、河南、山西等省的煤矿观摩传播和交流先进经验。
    先进经验观摩传播队的任务是，针对当前煤矿生产上的几个重要环节，进一步推广煤炭工业部规定在今年推广的三十六项主要先进经验。这些先进经验的内容包括：全面提高现场生产管理工作，加强掘进，节约坑木，减少电溜子事故和作好安全生产等五个方面。大力推广这些方面的经验，将有力地推动煤炭工业大面积丰产运动更深入展开，以保证完成和超额完成今年的煤炭生产任务。
    这个先进经验观摩传播队的成员，大都是先进生产者和先进单位的代表。他们到各地煤矿之后，将采取现场参观，口头介绍，实地表演等方法，边传播、边观摩、边学习。
    7月20日，全国总工会副主席许之桢和煤炭工业部副部长刘向三接见了参加先进经验观摩传播队的先进生产者，鼓励他们除了传播好自己的经验以外，还要好好地学习兄弟单位的经验，以便取长补短，共同提高，积极深入地开展增产节约运动，为国家生产更多更好的煤炭。（附图片）
