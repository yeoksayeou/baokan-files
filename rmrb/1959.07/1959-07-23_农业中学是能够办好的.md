Agricultural Middle Schools Can Be Run Well
By Our Commentator

A new form of half-day agricultural middle school has sprung up and grown across the country since last spring. Currently, provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu, Heilongjiang, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region all have a considerable number of agricultural middle schools, which are constantly being consolidated and improved. Many agricultural middle schools, running frugally, have adhered to half-day study and engaged in productive labor. On the one hand, they have met the schooling demands of a large number of graduating senior primary school students, and on the other hand, they are training a large number of junior technical cadres for socialist agriculture. Well-run agricultural middle schools have raised the banner of technological and cultural revolution in rural areas and are welcomed by the broad masses of commune members and students' parents.

Some schools in Jiangsu Province, one of the birthplaces of agricultural middle schools, especially in Jiangyin County, have set an example for running agricultural middle schools well by increasing the quality of teaching, achieving self-sufficiency in teachers' salaries, students' book fees, and food expenses in the process of striving for production self-sufficiency. Teachers and students of Douyan Agricultural Middle School in Zhuji County, Zhejiang, have modified and created more than sixty new-style agricultural tools in the past year, promoting the local technological innovation movement. The early rice crop planted by teachers and students of Xixi Agricultural Middle School in Sheng County has high yields, and the masses praise them as "pioneers of the cultural revolution and locomotives of production." Dongyuan Agricultural Middle School in Dongxiang County, Jiangxi, is hailed by the masses as "a hand for developing social activities in the township and an important force in the rural cultural revolution." Daqu Agricultural Middle School in Yuncheng County, Shanxi, which has been running for more than two years, has already transferred more than thirty students with preliminary technical knowledge to the communes. Such examples exist everywhere and prove that agricultural middle schools can be run well.

How can agricultural middle schools be run well? Based on the experience of agricultural middle schools in various regions over the past year, especially the experience of production self-sufficiency in Jiangyin Agricultural Middle Schools, the key lies in grasping several important links under the attention and strengthened leadership of party committees at all levels, such as: clarifying the nature and tasks of agricultural middle schools, arranging productive labor well, and actively improving teaching quality. Agricultural middle schools are founded to adapt to the development of socialist construction and the great leap forward in agricultural production. They have gradually developed under the principle of "walking on two legs" in running schools, under the attention and strengthened leadership of party committees at all levels, and with the support of the masses. To run agricultural middle schools well, work must be carried out according to the nature and tasks of agricultural middle schools. Agricultural middle schools are half-day schools that aim to train junior technical cadres for socialist agriculture who have both socialist consciousness and cultural and scientific knowledge. They are different from ordinary middle schools. Ordinary middle schools are full-day schools that focus on teaching combined with productive labor. They are also different from rural adult spare-time schools. Spare-time schools are places for political and cultural learning in addition to productive labor. Therefore, the operating principles of agricultural middle schools should not follow those of full-day ordinary middle schools, but rather make specific arrangements based on their own characteristics in terms of student enrollment age, courses taught, teaching methods, and so on. Comrade Lu Dingyi pointed out four principles in a letter to the Propaganda Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee on March 14. Most agricultural middle schools in various regions are now working according to these four principles, but some problems have also arisen in some places. For example, some places rigidly stipulate that "over-aged youths" must drop out of school, so that some "over-aged youths" who were originally suitable for attending agricultural middle schools have to drop out of school. In fact, the labor force occupied by agricultural middle school students is not much. According to an investigation by Comrade Chen Guang, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, the labor force occupied by agricultural middle schools in rural areas is actually not very large. Comrade Chen Guang said that the 303 students of Ligang Agricultural Middle School account for 1.48% of the total population of 20,500 people in Ligang People's Commune. That is to say, in one hundred people, only nearly one and a half people are studying in agricultural middle schools. There are 86 students over the age of 17. If these people are all regarded as full laborers, then they account for 1.4% of the total labor force of 6,200 in the whole commune. These 86 people still engage in productive labor for half a day. If calculated by half, the number is even smaller; there are 83 production teams in the whole commune, averaging only one laborer from every two teams. According to a symposium with students of Ligang Agricultural Middle School, they used to work all day at home, averaging 7 work points per person per day. Now, after entering the agricultural middle school, they work half a day, averaging 5 work points per person per day, only a difference of 2 work points. Therefore, from the perspective of labor productivity, the actual labor force occupied by students over 17 years old in the school is even smaller. It can be seen that the issue of "over-aged youths" dropping out of school cannot be rigidly stipulated without analysis. Moreover, after these young students learn political, cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge in agricultural middle schools, they will be an important technical force for the commune. They will have a good impact on agricultural production; this cannot be calculated by simple labor force figures. Therefore, various regions must flexibly handle the issue of "over-aged youths" dropping out of school based on specific circumstances, such as the amount and strength of the labor force. Since agricultural middle schools are half-day middle schools that train junior agricultural technical cadres, they must both attach importance to productive labor and teach and learn earnestly, so that students can lay a solid foundation in secondary cultural and scientific knowledge and basic production knowledge and skills. This requires a good arrangement of teaching and productive labor, so that students can both study well and work well, and achieve "agricultural middle school, agricultural middle school, both expert and red, learning is really good, production pioneers." From the experience of agricultural middle schools in Jiangyin County and Daqu Agricultural Middle School in Yuncheng County, half-day study and half-day labor are both achievable and necessary. Well-run agricultural middle schools in Jiangyin County make good production arrangements according to the age of students and the characteristics of sideline skills, adapt to local conditions, establish production bases, and implement agriculture and sideline industries in parallel. This economically reduces the burden on production teams and students' parents, enables teachers and students to concentrate on teaching, and lays a good foundation for consolidating agricultural middle schools. This proves that if agricultural middle schools can carry out production in a planned and step-by-step manner, they will not only not weaken the rural labor force and affect rural production work, but also create wealth in production and set up high-yield banners for agriculture. Last year, each student in Daqu Agricultural Middle School in Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province, averaged 160 working days, and the school's sideline income was more than 1,000 yuan. In addition to adding school equipment and solving funding problems, there was also a surplus of more than 600 yuan. The key here is how to make good production arrangements according to the characteristics of agricultural middle school students. This is also an important issue that is worth studying in the combination of teaching and productive labor in ordinary middle schools, privately-run vocational middle schools of various types, and secondary specialized schools. Solving this problem can prevent the inability to carry out production or teaching work normally due to too much or insufficient production space.

Arranging productive labor well in agricultural middle schools is only one aspect of running agricultural middle schools well, and another aspect is how to improve teaching quality.

Agricultural middle schools in Jiangyin County and other places have accumulated a lot of experience in improving teaching quality over the past year or so. From the experience of agricultural middle schools in Jiangyin County, the key is to arrange time appropriately and reasonably. Especially important is to arrange sufficient time for teachers to study independently, prepare lessons, and grade homework. If students have fixed time for class and self-study, they can study earnestly; if teachers have sufficient time for self-study, lesson preparation, and homework grading, they can teach earnestly and continue their studies. If teachers teach earnestly and students study earnestly, the quality of teaching can be significantly improved. The Chinese language scores of 49 first-year students in Mazhen Agricultural Middle School in Jiangyin County have increased from a total average of 63 points in the previous semester to 72.8 points this semester. In a test in June at Nanshan Agricultural Middle School in Yongxin County, Jiangxi, the average scores were: 82.5 points in politics, 78.5 points in Chinese, and 83.2 points in arithmetic. It can be seen that the quality of teaching in agricultural middle schools can be improved. The main problem here is that teachers and students have time to constantly work hard to study, teach earnestly, and learn earnestly. Teachers at Ligang Agricultural Middle School have time to regularly attend classes at Ligang Ordinary Middle School and learn from ordinary middle school teachers. They have also jointly formed teaching and research groups to frequently exchange experiences, and therefore the quality of teaching at Ligang Agricultural Middle School can be continuously improved.

Agricultural middle schools in various regions have been running for more than a year, and most have grown and consolidated with the progress of productive labor and the improvement of teaching quality. They will train a large number of junior technical cadres with a secondary cultural level needed for socialist agriculture for the people's communes. After this summer vacation, a considerable number of graduating senior primary school students may enter agricultural middle schools to study. It is hoped that agricultural middle schools in various regions will continue to work hard, absorb good experiences, engage in productive labor on the one hand, teach earnestly on the other hand, and further run the schools well to train more junior technical forces for agricultural production!

    农业中学是能够办好的
    本报评论员
    一种新形式的半日制的农业中学，从去年春天以后，在全国各地像雨后春笋似地发展成长起来。目前，江苏、浙江、江西、福建、山东、山西、河南、湖北、贵州、四川、甘肃、黑龙江等省和广西僮族自治区，都有着相当数量的农业中学，正在不断地巩固和提高。许多农业中学，勤俭办学，坚持了半日制的学习，进行了生产劳动。一方面满足了大量高小毕业生的升学要求，一方面为社会主义农业培养着大批的初级技术干部。办得好的农业中学，在农村中树起了技术革命和文化革命的旗帜，得到了广大社员群众和学生家长的欢迎。
    农业中学发源地之一的江苏省、特别是江阴县的有些学校，在争取生产自给的过程中，既提高了教学质量，又做到了教师工资、学生书籍费和菜金自给，为办好农业中学做出了榜样。浙江诸暨县斗岩农业中学的师生，一年来改制和创造了新式农具六十多件，推进了当地的技术革新运动。嵊县溪西农业中学师生种的连作早稻，产量高，群众称赞他们是“文化革命的先锋，生产上的火车头”。江西东乡县东源农业中学被群众称作是“乡里开展社会活动的‘一只手’，是农村文化革命的一支重要力量”。山西运城县大渠农业中学，已经办了两年多，已经为公社输送了三十多个具有初步技术知识的学生。这样的事例各地都有，都证明了农业中学是能够办得好的。
    怎样才能把农业中学办好呢？从各地农业中学一年多的办学经验来看，特别是从江阴农业中学的生产自给经验来看，主要是在各级党委重视和加强领导下，抓住了几个重要环节，如：明确农业中学的性质和任务，安排好生产劳动，积极提高教学质量等。农业中学是适应社会主义建设和农业生产大跃进形势的发展而创办的。它是在贯彻办学的“两条腿走路”的方针下，在各级党委的重视、加强领导和群众的支持下，逐步发展起来的。要办好农业中学，就要根据农业中学的性质和任务进行工作。农业中学是半日制的学校，要培养出有社会主义觉悟又有文化科学知识的社会主义农业的初级技术干部。它不同于普通中学。普通中学是以教学为主，结合生产劳动的全日制学校。也不同于农村的成人业余学校。业余学校是在生产劳动之余，进行政治文化学习的场所。所以，农业中学的办学原则不应该向全日制的普通中学看齐，而在招收学生的年龄，讲授的课程，教学的方法，等等方面，都要根据自己的特点作出具体的安排。陆定一同志在3月14日写给中共江苏省委宣传部的信中，指明了四条原则。现在各地农业中学大多根据这四条原则进行工作，但有一些地方也发生了一些问题。如硬性规定“超龄青年”必须退学，以致原来还适合于上农业中学的一些“超龄青年”只好退学。其实，农业中学所占青少年学生的劳动力是并不多的。据中共江苏省委书记陈光同志的调查，发现农业中学所占农村的劳动力实际上并不很多。陈光同志说，利港农业中学学生三百零三人，为利港人民公社全社人口二万零五百人的1.48％。也就是说，在一百个人中，只有将近一个半人在农业中学学习。学生入学年龄在十七岁以上的八十六人，如果这些人都当作整劳动力，那末，则占全社劳动力总数六千二百人的1.4％。这八十六人每天还要以半天时间从事生产劳动，如以减半计算，为数更少；全社有八十三个生产小队，平均两个小队只分出劳动力一人。根据利港农业中学学生座谈，他们在家整日劳动，平均每人每天得七分工，现在进入农业中学，半天劳动，平均每人每天可得五分工，只差两分工。因此，从劳动生产率来看，该校十七岁以上的学生实际所占的劳动力，就为数更少了。由此可见，“超龄青年”的退学问题是不能不加分析地给以硬性规定的。何况，这些青年学生，在农业中学里学习了政治文化和科学技术知识以后，对于公社将是一支重要的技术力量。他们将对农业生产发生良好的作用；这就不可能用简单的劳动力数字来计算了。因此，各地必须根据具体情况，如劳动力的多少、强弱等的条件，灵活处理“超龄青年”的退学问题。农业中学既是半日制的培养农业初级技术干部的中学，那就必须既重视生产劳动，又认真教好学好，让学生们能够打好中等文化科学知识和基本的生产知识与技能的基础。这就要很好地安排教学和生产劳动两方面的工作，让学生们既能够好好学习，又能够好好劳动，做到“农中农中，又专又红，学习真好，生产先锋”。从江阴县各农业中学和运城县大渠农业中学的经验来看，半天学习，半天劳动是可以做到的，也是必要这样做的。江阴县办得好的农业中学，根据学生的年龄和副业技能的特点，因人因地制宜地作好生产布局，建立生产基地，实行农、副业并举。这在经济上减轻了生产队和学生家长的负担，使师生能够安心教学，为巩固农业中学打好了基础。这就证明，农业中学如果能够做到有计划有步骤地进行生产，不仅不会减弱农村的劳动力，影响农村的生产工作，而且可以在生产上创造财富，并为农业树立高产旗帜。山西运城县大渠农业中学，去年每个学生平均作了一百六十个劳动日，全校副业收入还有一千多元，除增添了学校设备、解决了经费等外，还结余六百多元资金。这里的关键是怎样根据农业中学学生的特点作好生产布局的问题。这在普通中学、民办各种职业中学和中等专业学校等的教学和生产劳动相结合方面，也是值得研究的一个重要问题。解决了这个问题，才能够不致因为生产场地过多或者不足而不能正常地进行生产或教学工作。
    农业中学安排好生产劳动，只是办好农业中学的一个方面，又一个方面是怎样提高教学质量。
    江阴县和其它地方的农业中学，在提高教学质量方面，一年多来，已经有了不少经验。从江阴县农业中学的经验来说，主要是妥善地合理地安排时间。尤其重要的是，给教师们安排充分的自学、备课、批改作业的时间。学生有了固定的上课、自修的时间，就可以认真学习；教师有了充分的自学、备课、批改作业的时间，就可以认真教课，并且进修。教师认真教，学生认真学，教学质量就能显著提高。江阴县马镇农业中学一年级四十九人的语文成绩，已从上学期总平均六十三分增加到本学期的七十二点八分。江西永新县拿山农业中学六月间的一次测验，平均成绩是：政治八十二点五分，语文七十八点五分，算术八十三点二分。由此可见，农业中学的教学质量是能够提高的。这里的主要问题，在于师生有时间不断地努力钻研，认真教认真学。利港农业中学教师有时间经常到利港普通中学去听课，向普通中学教师学习。他们还共同组成了教研组经常交流经验等等，因而利港农业中学的教学质量就能够不断地提高。
    各地农业中学已经办了一年多，大多数已经随着生产劳动的进展、教学质量的提高而成长和巩固了。它们将为人民公社培养出大批的社会主义农业所需要的具有中等文化水平的初级技术干部。今年暑期以后，可能还有相当数量的高小毕业生进入农业中学学习。希望各地农业中学继续努力，吸取好的经验，一面生产劳动，一面认真教学，进一步把学校办好，为农业生产培养更多的初级技术力量！
