    The Institute of the History of Science and Technology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Association for the History of Science and Technology jointly convened the All-Union Conference on the History of Science and Technology in Moscow from May 27 to June 1. More than 500 scientists attended the meeting. Delegations from China, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and other countries were invited to participate. At the conference, Fiegurovsky, director of the Institute of the History of Science and Technology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, summarized the work of the past ten years since the Soviet Academy of Sciences conference in 1949 formulated the plan for the study of the history of science, in accordance with the spirit of the 21st Congress of the CPSU. He said: The future tasks of the Institute of the History of Science and Technology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences are to first study the history of science and technology in the forty years since the founding of the Soviet Union (especially after World War II), to study the central issues related to the development of science in various historical periods, to study the history of the development of science and technology in the motherland, and correspondingly to conduct research on the history of science and technology in the world. Svarejin gave a report on "The Establishment of the Material and Technical Basis of Communism and the Tasks of the History of Science." He pointed out that the study of the establishment of the material and technical basis of communist society has great theoretical significance; historians of science and technology should analyze the characteristics of the material and technical basis of socialist society and communist society from a Marxist-Leninist point of view, so as to elucidate how science and technology should develop in order to create objective conditions most favorably for the completion of this foundation. Li Yan and Xi Zezong, the representatives of our country who attended the meeting, read papers on the history of Chinese mathematics and the history of Chinese astronomy in the mathematics group and the astronomy group.

    苏联讨论科学技术史的研究任务
    5月27日到6月1日苏联科学院科学技术史研究所和苏联科学技术史协会在莫斯科联合召开了全苏科学技术史大会。出席会议的有五百多位科学家。应邀参加会议的还有中国、德意志民主共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚等国代表团。在大会上，苏联科学技术史研究所所长费谷罗夫斯基根据苏共二十一次大会精神，总结了自1949年苏联科学院大会制定科学史研究规划以后十年来的工作，他说：苏联科学技术史研究所今后的任务是首先研究苏联建国四十年以来（特别是第二次世界大战后）的科学技术史，研究各个历史时期和科学发展有关的中心问题，研究祖国科学技术发展史，并相应地对世界科学技术史进行研究。司瓦雷金作了“共产主义物质技术基础的建立和科学史的任务”的报告。他指出研究共产主义社会的物质技术基础建立的问题有着巨大的理论意义；科学技术史工作者，应该以马克思列宁主义的观点，分析社会主义社会和共产主义社会物质技术基础的特点，从而阐明科学技术应如何发展，才能最有利地为这个基础的建成创造客观条件。我国出席这次会议的代表是李儼和席泽宗。他们在数学组和天文组宣读了有关中国数学史和中国天文学史的论文。
