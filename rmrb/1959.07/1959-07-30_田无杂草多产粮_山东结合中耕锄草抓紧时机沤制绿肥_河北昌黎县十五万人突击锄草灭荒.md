Fields Free of Weeds Yield More Grain
Shandong Combines Middle Tillage and Weeding, Seizing the Opportunity to Ferment Green Manure
Hebei’s Changli County Mobilizes 150,000 People in a Concentrated Weeding and Waste Eradication Campaign
(Our Dispatch from Jinan, July 29th) People's communes in Shandong Province are tightly grasping the current favorable conditions of high temperatures, abundant rainfall, and rampant weed growth, combining middle tillage and weeding to launch a green manure fermentation campaign.

Since the beginning of the rainy season, Party committees at all levels in Shandong Province have strengthened leadership in fertilizer accumulation and fermentation. People's communes in Licheng, Rizhao, Shouzhang, and Chenwu counties launched a week-long campaign in which everyone participated, eliminating weeds and fermenting green manure. The four counties mobilized 798,000 laborers for weeding, waste eradication, and green manure pressing, fermenting over 3.4 billion catties of green manure in ten days, equivalent to the amount fermented in over a month in the spring. Fertilizer accumulation and production teams in various counties, in order to collect large quantities of green fodder and weeds, have closely combined weeding and waste eradication with strengthening field management of summer and autumn crops. According to incomplete statistics, most of the province's 116.6 million mu of summer and autumn crops have been weeded two to three times, and over 21 million mu of spring crops have had approximately 2,000 catties of farmyard manure applied per mu.

Seriously implementing fertilizer accumulation policies is the key to the rapid development of fertilizer accumulation work. In Shanghe County, combining green manure fermentation with the clearing and returning of past fertilizer investment to commune members, the daily progress of fertilizer accumulation in 65 production brigades and their subordinate teams nearly doubled. People's communes in Xintai County also combined the implementation of fertilizer accumulation policies by contracting fertilizer tasks level by level to production teams or production groups, fixing responsibility to individuals, and establishing a system of bonuses for exceeding quotas, quickly launching a high tide of green manure fermentation. In addition to collectively digging pits to ferment green manure, many production teams encouraged commune members to not return empty-handed from the fields, bringing back large quantities of green fodder and weeds to fill pens or dig pits for fermenting green manure, with the entire county fermenting over 1 billion catties of various fertilizers in just over a month.

In the process of green manure fermentation, people's communes in various localities widely adopted the method of bringing the three types of pens (pig, sheep, and cattle pens) to the mountains, fields, and digging pits in the fields, utilizing local materials to ferment green manure and farmyard manure. Since early June, people's communes in Licheng, Yishui, Rizhao, and other counties have built over 38,700 field pens and dug over 19,200 fertilizer fermentation pits. Combined with weeding and waste eradication, the three counties have filled pens and fermented green manure with a total of over 3.2 billion catties. People's communes in many counties, based on the distribution of autumn-sown wheat fields, have adopted the method of digging large pits for every ten or eight mu, and small pits for every five or three mu, digging pits for fertilizer fermentation wherever there is grass and water, making fermentation and application convenient, and saving transportation labor. In order to improve the quality of green manure, Party committees at all levels have also actively organized cadres from agricultural and agricultural science research departments to go deep into the communes, strengthen specific technical guidance, and ensure that the vast majority of fermented green manure meets quality requirements.

(Our Dispatch from Tianjin, July 29th) Under the slogan of "No Inch of Land Untended, Vow to Seize a Bumper Autumn Harvest," Changli County, Hebei, launched a massive weeding and waste eradication campaign involving 150,000 people, eliminating all weeds and wasteland, totaling over 250,000 mu, by July 18th.

Changli County has sown a total of 1.51 million mu of field crops this year, generally growing well, with seedlings emerging uniformly and strongly. However, due to the previous concentration of efforts on summer harvesting and planting, and recent heavy rainfall, many lands have experienced weed infestation. According to inspections, the county has 250,000 mu of weed-infested land, with over 18,000 mu being severely infested and over 81,000 mu having third-class seedlings. The County Party Committee conducted research and decided to list weeding, waste eradication, and topdressing as the current central task, and quickly mobilized more than 150,000 people to launch a waste eradication battle. From late June to July 18th, all 250,000 mu of wasteland were eliminated, 960,000 mu of fields were weeded twice, and 143,000 mu were weeded three times, basically achieving weed-free and seedling-clear conditions. At the same time, 120,000 mu of third-class cotton, corn, and multi-eared sorghum seedlings were top-dressed once after the rain, greatly promoting the normal growth of field seedlings.

During this battle, Party committee secretaries at all levels went deep into the fields, strengthened specific leadership, and helped various teams with waste eradication. This greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for waste eradication. According to the demands of the masses, communes and teams generally implemented the "four-to-the-field" method of eating, meeting, feeding, and propaganda, reducing travel labor, saving time, ensuring rest, and improving labor efficiency.

In terms of labor force utilization, communes and teams all adopted the "five-fixed" method of commune contracting to teams, brigades contracting to small teams, small teams contracting to groups, groups contracting to plots, and fixing leaders, personnel, time, tasks, and land plots. The daily progress of weeding in the county increased from 50,000 mu to over 79,000 mu.

    田无杂草多产粮
    山东结合中耕锄草抓紧时机沤制绿肥
    河北昌黎县十五万人突击锄草灭荒
    本报济南29日电　山东省各地人民公社紧紧抓住当前气温高、雨水多、杂草丛生的大好时机，结合中耕锄草，开展沤制绿肥运动。
    进入雨季以来，山东省各级党委都加强了积肥、沤肥工作的领导。历城、日照、寿张、成武四县的人民公社，开展了一次人人动手、户户除草沤绿肥的突击周，四个县出动锄草灭荒、沤压绿肥的劳力达七十九万八千人，十天内就沤压绿肥三十四亿多斤，相当于春季一个多月沤制肥料的数量。各县的积肥、造肥专业队，为大量收集青棵、杂草，都紧密的结合锄草灭荒，加强了夏秋作物的田间管理。据不完整的统计，全省一亿一千六百多万亩夏秋作物，大部分已锄过两遍至三遍草，其中有二千一百多万亩春季作物，每亩追施了二千斤左右的圈杂肥。
    认真贯彻执行积肥政策，是积肥工作迅速开展的关键。商河县结合沤制绿肥，清理归还了社员过去积肥投资后，六十五个生产大队和所属小队积肥日进度增加近倍。新泰县各人民公社还结合贯彻积肥政策，将积肥任务逐级包工落实到生产队或生产小组，责任固定到人，并制订了超额奖励的制度，很快掀起沤制绿肥的高潮。许多生产队除集体挖坑沤制绿肥外，社员们下地干活不空手，回家捎回大量的青棵、杂草，用来填圈或挖坑沤制绿肥，全县仅一个多月就沤造各种肥料十亿多斤。
    在沤制绿肥中，各地人民公社都广泛采取了三圈（猪、羊、牛圈）上山、下田和田头挖坑、就地取材的办法沤造绿肥和圈肥。历城、沂水、日照等县的人民公社从6月上旬以来，已在田间建栏圈三万八千七百多座，挖沤肥坑一万九千二百多个，三个县结合锄草灭荒已在栏圈内填草造肥和沤制绿肥共达三十二亿多斤。许多县的人民公社还根据秋种麦田的分布情况，采取十亩八亩一大坑，五亩三亩一小坑，那里有草有水，就在那里挖坑沤肥，沤制施用都很方便，又节省了运输劳力。为了提高绿肥的质量，各级党委还积极的组织农业和农业科学研究部门的干部，深入公社，加强具体的技术指导，使沤制的绿肥，绝大部分合乎质量要求。　　　　　　　　　　（宋杰、丁学超）
    本报天津29日电　河北昌黎县在“寸土不荒，誓夺秋田丰收”的口号下，十五万人展开锄草灭荒大战，到7月18日，全部灭草荒二十五万多亩。
    昌黎县今年共播种大田作物一百五十一万亩，一般生长良好，苗齐苗壮。但由于前段集中力量突击夏收夏种，近期雨水又多，不少土地出现了荒苗现象。据检查，全县有草荒地二十五万亩，较严重的有一万八千多亩，三类苗有八万一千多亩。县委进行了研究，决定把锄地灭荒追肥列为当前突击中心任务，并迅速发动十五万多人展开了抢荒战斗。由6月下旬到7月18日，二十五万亩荒地全部消灭，九十六万亩大田锄了二遍，其中十四万三千亩锄了三遍，基本达到地净苗清。同时又对十二万亩棉花、玉米、多穗高粱的三类苗趁雨后追上了一次肥，大大促进了田苗的正常生长。
    在这一战斗中，各级党委书记深入田间，加强具体领导，到各队帮助抢荒。这样，就大大鼓舞了群众的抢荒积极性。根据群众要求，各社、队普遍推行了吃饭、开会、饲养、宣传“四到田”的办法，减少了往返途劳，节省了时间，保证了休息，也提高了劳动效率。
    在劳动力使用上，各社、队都采取了社包队、大队包小队、小队包组，组包片、人包垅和定领导、定人员、定时间、定任务、定地块的“五定”办法，全县锄草日进度由五万亩增加到七万九千多亩。
