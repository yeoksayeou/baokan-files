    Field Club
    The Fifth Team Club of the Dechang Management Area, Heping Commune, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang, decided to change its concentrated activities to dispersed field activities based on the characteristics of long days and short nights during the summer hoeing season and the long hours that commune members spent working in the fields. They performed drum ballads, clapper talks, choruses, and solos at the field edges, and organized short and pithy recreational programs such as poetry contests, ball games, and musical chairs, which were very popular among the masses. Not only young people participated, but also the elderly were attracted. Once, during the game of "musical chairs", Grandpa Sun lost and even sang a section of "Liang Shanbo" as an exception.
    The lively field recreational life regulated the tense summer hoeing labor and enriched the lives of the commune members.

    田间俱乐部
    黑龙江肇东县和平公社德昌管理区第五队俱乐部，根据夏锄期间天长夜短、社员集中在田间作业时间长等特点，决定把集中活动改为田间分散活动，在田头演出大鼓、快板、合唱、独唱，并组织赛诗、碰球、击鼓传花等短小精悍的文娱节目，很受群众欢迎。参加活动的不单是年轻人，老年人也被吸引进来了。有一次玩“击鼓传花”，老孙大爷输了，还破例唱了一段“梁山伯”。
    活跃的田间文娱生活，调节了紧张的夏锄劳动，丰富了社员的生活。
