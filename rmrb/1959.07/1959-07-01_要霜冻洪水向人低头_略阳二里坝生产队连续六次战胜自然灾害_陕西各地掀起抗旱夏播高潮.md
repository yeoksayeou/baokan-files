"To ensure a bumper autumn harvest depends on people, not heaven." The members of the Erliba Production Team of the Jiegouting Management District, Chengguan Commune, Lueyang County, with such firm belief, have continuously overcome six natural disasters, achieving great results in striving for a bumper autumn grain harvest. The team originally planned to plant 1,000 mu of corn, but has now planted 1,200 mu, exceeding the autumn planting plan.

The Erliba Production Team is located in the steep slopes and gullies around the Tapo Temple, 1,800 meters above sea level, with a cold climate. Here, crops suffer from hail, black frost, and torrential rain every year. This year, under the leadership of the Party, the enthusiasm of the members soared. Six hundred and twenty mu of wheat yielded a bumper harvest, and the early corn was planted early and in large quantities, growing well. However, from May 6th to 29th, for more than 20 days, they suffered six consecutive attacks of natural disasters such as hail, snow, and black frost, and the crops suffered severe losses. For example, from May 6th to 9th, it snowed twice in a row, reaching five fen thick, and 580 mu of wheat and corn were frozen to death, and many walnuts and peppers were also frozen to death. Many members saw this situation and their morale was low, and some even felt hopeless and prepared to move away. The Party branch of the production team immediately and deeply publicized the principle of "man can conquer nature" to the masses, and mobilized more than 200 people to quickly replant the frozen corn seedlings; if the wheat was damaged by frost, they planted more corn. The whole team lit torches and rushed to plant for three days and three nights, regardless of day or night. In addition to replanting 600 mu of corn, they also expanded the planting by 250 mu.

However, on the same night that the corn was planted, there was another black frost. This frost disaster was even more severe than the previous snow disaster, and most of the leaves were frozen as if they were dead. The Party branch led the masses with firm confidence to fight against the disaster. In addition to replanting immediately, they fought hard for twelve days, reclaiming 200 mu of wasteland by seizing the fire stubble, and planting all of it with corn. On May 23rd and 29th, there were two more white frosts, especially on the 29th, when egg-sized hail was dense, and there were violent storms and heavy rain. The slope land was scraped into bare boards by the flood from top to bottom, and stones and mud were piled up on the flat land, and the gullies became rivers. Corn and wheat were washed away, and even the hearts of various vegetables were destroyed. But hail is big, but it is not bigger than the power of people, and floods are fierce, but they cannot stop heroes. Under the leadership of the Party, they continued to wage a tenacious struggle against natural disasters. The thirty-odd members of the Chengjia Team came out together to fight against hail and floods. After rescue, the entire team's five-mu-plus vegetable seedlings did not suffer major losses.

On June 3rd, the third hail fell, this time three inches thick, but it not only did not defeat the heroic fighting spirit, but also made the team members more enthusiastic. More than 200 members of the team unanimously swore to march into the great production and disaster relief. After the Yijiahe Team challenged other teams, all teams responded one after another. Their slogans are: "Men, women, old and young are all mobilized, every household closes its doors and goes to the mountains, works hard day and night for forty days, guarantees no reduction in production from disasters, every household has three mu of vegetables and six mu of buckwheat, resolutely achieves it without wavering, manages corn and miscellaneous grains well together, and achieves everyone eating enough and eating well." Due to the soaring enthusiasm of the members, the team has overfulfilled the corn planting plan, planting a total of 1,200 mu of corn; in addition, the team has also called on every household and everyone to seize every opportunity to plant, and every inch of land must be planted. Now they are using the edges of fields, corners of land, front and back of houses, and both sides of ditches and canals to expand the planting of miscellaneous grains on a large scale.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 30th - A mass movement to resist drought and plant summer crops is being launched throughout Shaanxi Province.

During the summer planting season, there has been very little rainfall in Shaanxi, especially since June, when there has been basically no rainfall, and the drought situation is becoming more and more serious. After studying the above situation, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee instructed all localities in mid-June to actively find ways to resist drought and rush to plant. According to the instructions of the higher authorities, all localities mobilized the masses to discuss summer planting work, organized labor and livestock power, and put forward the fighting slogan of "If it doesn't rain, don't wait for the sky, try every means to plant autumn fields." Now, all localities are adopting methods such as digging wells and ponds, carrying water to plant, and setting off a campaign to resist drought and plant summer crops. After the basic completion of the local summer harvest, the Hanzhong Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately shifted the focus of its work to drought resistance and summer planting. Dali County carried out the three-sided (irrigation, land preparation, and planting) and five-grabbing (grabbing time, grabbing water, grabbing soil moisture, grabbing area, and grabbing fertilizer) movement, and launched a surprise planting campaign. By June 23rd, it had rushed to plant more than 440,000 mu of late autumn crops, accounting for 81% of the planned summer planting area.

Under the unified leadership of the people's communes in various places, in accordance with the principle of equal exchange, they organized internal cooperation and support within the communes, overcame difficulties such as insufficient labor, and accelerated the progress of summer planting. Of the 120,000 people participating in drought resistance and summer planting in Zhouzhi County, more than 10,000 were organized to cooperate according to the method of exchanging labor and paying wages in cash. Due to the drought in the Bao Hui Canal and Leng Hui Canal in Hanzhong City, the canal water was reduced. In order to ensure that everyone could plant rice seedlings, the communes in the irrigation area convened a meeting of the directors of the management stations of each commune on June 17th, with the communes with more water supporting those with less water, and the upstream supporting the downstream, giving up canal water to expand the summer planting area as much as possible.

    要霜冻洪水向人低头
    略阳二里坝生产队连续六次战胜自然灾害
    陕西各地掀起抗旱夏播高潮
    据陕西日报消息：“要叫秋田大丰收，在人不在天”。略阳县城关公社接官亭管理区二里坝生产队的社员们，就是以这样的坚定信念，连续战胜了六次自然灾害，为争取秋粮大丰收取得了巨大成绩。全队原计划种包谷一千亩，现已下种一千二百亩，超额完成了秋种计划。
    二里坝生产队，位于海拔一千八百公尺高的塔坡寺周围陡坡夹沟里，气候寒冷。这里农作物年年遭受冰雹、黑霜、暴雨的危害。今年在党的领导下，社员干劲冲天，六百二十亩小麦获得丰收，早包谷种的又早又多，生长良好。但是从5月6日到29日的二十多天里，连续遭受六次冰雹、雪、黑霜等自然灾害的袭击，庄稼受到严重损失。如5月6日至9日，连续两次下雪达五分厚，有五百八十亩小麦和包谷被冻死，核桃、花椒也冻死了很多。许多社员看到这种情况情绪低落，有的甚至感到没有希望，准备迁走。生产队的党支部立即深入地向群众宣传“人能胜天”的道理，并且发动了二百多名群众，很快把冻死的包谷苗补种起来；麦子冻坏了就多种包谷，全队点着火把，不分昼夜的抢种了三天三夜，除补种了六百亩包谷以外，还扩种了二百五十亩。
    但是，就在种上包谷的当天晚上，又出现了一次黑霜。这次霜灾比上次雪灾还厉害，大部树叶都冻得如同死了一般。党支部又以坚定的信心领导群众和灾害作斗争，除马上再补种以外，又苦战了十二天，抢火茬开荒二百亩，全部种上了包谷。5月23日和29日，又出现了两次白霜，尤其是29日，鸡蛋大的冰雹密密麻麻，暴风猛雨，坡地从上而下被洪水刮成老板，平地石头、土泥成堆，沟湾成河，包谷小麦被冲走，各种蔬菜连心都被打坏。但冰雹大，大不过人的力量，洪水猛，挡不住英雄好汉。在党的领导下，他们继续和天灾作顽强的斗争。成家曹小队三十多户社员，大家一起出来与冰雹、洪水斗争，经过抢救，全小队五亩多菜秧没受大的损失。
    6月3日又下了第三次冰雹，这次虽下了三寸厚，不但没有打倒英雄们的斗志，而且社员们的干劲更大了，全队二百多名社员一致宣誓，向生产救灾大进军。义家河队向其他各队提出挑战后，各队都纷纷应战。他们的口号是：“男女老小总动员，户户关门都上山，昼夜苦战四十天，保证受灾不减产，户户三（亩）菜六亩荞，坚决实现不动摇，包谷杂粮齐管好，达到人人吃饱又吃好。”由于社员的干劲冲天，全队已超额完成包谷播种计划，共种包谷一千二百亩；此外，队里还号召户户、人人见缝插针，寸土必种，现在正利用田边、地角、房屋前后，水沟水渠两旁等空地，大量扩种杂粮。
    本报西安30日电　陕西省各地掀起群众性抗旱夏播运动。
    夏播期间，陕西各地降雨很少，特别是6月以来，基本上没有降雨，旱象愈来愈严重。中共陕西省委和陕西省人民委员会研究了上述情况后，在6月中旬指示各地积极设法抗旱抢播。各地根据上级指示发动群众讨论了夏播工作，组织劳畜力，并提出“天不下雨不等天，千方百计种秋田”的战斗口号。现在各地正采用掏井挖塘，担水点种等办法，掀起了抗旱夏播运动。中共汉中地委在当地夏收基本结束后，立即将工作重心转到抗旱夏播方面。大荔县开展三边（边灌溉、边整地、边下种）五抢（抢时间、抢水、抢墒、抢面积、抢肥料）运动，突击抢播，到6月23日已抢种晚秋四十四万多亩，占计划夏播面积的81％。
    各地人民公社在统一领导下，按照在等价交换的原则下，组织公社内部互相协作和支援，克服了劳力不足等困难，加速了夏播进度。盩厔全县参加抗旱夏播的十二万人中，就有一万多人是按照换工和现付工资的办法组织协作的。汉中市褒惠渠、冷惠渠由于天旱，渠水减少，灌溉区各公社为了大家都能插上秧，在6月17日召开了各公社管理站站长会议，以水源多的支援水源少的，上游支援下游，让出渠水尽量扩大夏播面积。　（薛永林）
