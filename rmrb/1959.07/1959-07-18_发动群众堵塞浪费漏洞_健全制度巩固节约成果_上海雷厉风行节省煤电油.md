Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 17th. Since entering the third quarter, Shanghai factories and enterprises have seen new developments in their work to save raw materials. Various industries have strengthened this work in a planned and organized way; the broad masses of workers are doing everything possible to make existing raw materials play a greater role and produce more products.

In the first half of this year, Shanghai factory and enterprise workers, in the high-yield, high-quality, and frugal competition, increased the city's total industrial output value by 58% compared to the same period last year. In the third quarter, Shanghai's industrial production will have even greater growth; to ensure greater growth in production, it is necessary to continue to increase the production of raw materials, further improve the use and management of raw materials, earnestly save, eliminate waste, and maximize the economic effect of existing materials. At present, the potential for savings in the city's factories and enterprises is still very large. The consumption of raw materials in advanced factories and backward factories differs greatly, and there is still considerable potential to be tapped in the use, management, and transportation of materials. To this end, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued special instructions, requiring the Party committees of various districts, the Party groups of various bureaus, and the Party organizations of various factories and enterprises to quickly mobilize cadres and the masses to take effective measures, decisively eliminate certain waste phenomena in the use, management, and transportation of materials, and further strengthen ideological education, establish and improve necessary rules and regulations to ensure it. Many industrial bureaus, professional companies, and factories have established production increase and savings offices or groups to be responsible for inspecting, supervising, and promoting savings work.

At present, the important content of the city's savings work is to save coal, coke, electricity, and petroleum, which are the most widely used and have the largest consumption. Relevant departments recently held two city-wide activist conferences to further promote the savings of these four materials. Many industries and industries, factories and factories have established counterpart connections and are competing with each other. Most factories have formulated and revised the targets and measures for saving coal and coke in the second half of the year, and have achieved results in a short period of time. In order to save coal, the Liming Printing and Dyeing Factory workers used their rest days to cut off more than 200 meters of unused "appendix" - empty water fin pipes, and put "clothes" (wrapped them) on more than 600 meters of bare water fin pipes and drying cylinder pillars, blocking more than 100 leaks of steam and heat dissipation. The factory's daily coal consumption has recently been reduced from 37 or 38 tons to 25 tons. The coal consumption of the Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory has also been reduced from 100 tons per day to 90 tons.

Strengthening the management of various raw materials and consolidating savings work through the system is an important measure currently being taken by Shanghai factories and enterprises. Recently, many factories have mobilized the masses to speak out freely and thoroughly, from the procurement, entry, storage, to the use of raw materials, and have improved and established a series of systems. After mobilizing the masses to expose waste, the No. 9 State Cotton Mill established a raw cotton management system, a waste and old material recycling system, a sub-cloth responsibility system, and a quality inspection system, etc., based on the causes of waste. After the Shanghai Radio Equipment Factory improved the relevant systems, the loss rate of major materials dropped from 20% to 5%. On this basis, many factories have also promoted team economic accounting to encourage workers to pay attention to reducing costs at any time.

The broad masses of workers have launched vigorous technical innovations to maximize the use of existing raw materials. Factories such as the Xinzhong Power Machinery Factory, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, and the Gongxing Machine Shipbuilding Factory are all improving the output of diesel engines and saving raw materials by improving the structure and increasing the pressure. The May 1st Electrical Machinery Factory has recently started producing a new type of motor that uses advanced insulation materials. It is much smaller than ordinary motors made of ordinary insulation materials, saving 30% of copper, 30% of silicon steel sheets, and 50% of pig iron, and the service life can be greatly extended.

    发动群众堵塞浪费漏洞　健全制度巩固节约成果
    上海雷厉风行节省煤电油
    新华社上海17日电　进入第三季度以来，上海工厂企业节约原料材料的工作有了新的发展。各个行业有计划有组织地加强了这一工作；广大职工群众更是千方百计地使现有原料材料发挥更大的作用，生产更多的产品。
    今年上半年，上海各工厂企业职工在高产优质厉行节约的竞赛中，使全市工业总产值比去年同期增长了58％。第三季度，上海工业生产将有更大的增长；为了保证生产的更大增长，就要继续努力增产原料材料，进一步做好原料材料的使用和管理工作，认真节约，杜绝浪费，使现有物资发挥最大的经济效果。目前全市工厂企业中的节约潜力还很大，先进厂和落后厂的原料材料消耗相差很远，在物资的使用、管理和运输方面也还有不少潜力可挖。为此，中共上海市委最近专门发出指示，要求各区委、党委、各局党组和各工厂企业的党组织，迅速发动干部和群众，采取有效措施，雷厉风行地消灭物资使用、管理、运输上的某些浪费现象，并且进一步加强思想教育，建立和健全应有的规章制度，加以保证。许多工业局、专业公司和工厂已纷纷成立增产节约办公室或小组，负责检查督促和推动节约工作。
    目前，全市节约工作的重要内容，是节约使用面最广、使用量最大的煤炭、焦炭、电和石油。有关部门最近已召开两次全市性的活动分子大会，进一步推动这四项物资的节约工作。许多行业与行业、工厂与工厂之间已对口挂钩，互相竞赛。大部分工厂已经制订和修订了下半年节约用煤用焦的指标和措施，并且已在短期内取得成绩。丽明印染厂为了节约煤，职工们利用厂休息日割掉了二百多米从来不用的“盲肠”——空水汀管子，给六百多米赤膊水汀管和烘缸柱子穿上了“衣服”（进行包扎），堵塞了一百多处漏汽散热的漏洞。这个厂每天的用煤量，最近已由三十七、八吨降低到二十五吨。上海第一印染厂煤耗也由每天一百吨减少到九十吨。
    加强各种原料材料的管理，从制度上巩固节约工作，是当前上海工厂企业正在采取的一项重要措施。最近期间，很多工厂都发动群众大鸣大放，从原料材料的采购、进厂、保管到使用，健全和建立了一系列的制度。国棉九厂在发动群众揭发浪费以后，根据造成浪费的原因，建立了原棉管理制度、废旧料回收制度、次布责任制度和质量检查制度等。上海无线电器材厂改进有关制度以后，主要材料的损耗率便由20％下降到5％。在此基础上，不少工厂还推行了班组经济核算，促进职工随时注意降低成本。
    广大职工群众纷纷大闹技术革新，使现有原料材料发挥更大的作用。新中动力机厂、上海机器厂、公兴机器造船厂等厂，都正在分别用改进结构和增加压力两种方式来提高柴油机的出力，节约原料和材料。五一电机厂最近已开始生产一种采用高级绝缘材料的新型电动机，它比一般用普通绝缘材料做成的电动机体积要小很多，可以节约30％的铜、30％的矽钢片和50％的生铁，而使用寿命还可以大大延长。（附图片）
