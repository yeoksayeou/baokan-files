Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 29th: The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's five large fixed open-hearth furnaces carried out technical operation performance competitions, tapping into the enterprise's internal potential, enabling them to complete the July high-quality steel production plan more than two days ahead of schedule. According to statistics from the 1st to the 28th, the average daily steel output increased by 374 tons compared to June.

After completing the plan ahead of schedule in the first half of the year, the workers of these five large open-hearth furnaces summarized their production experience from the previous stage. Entering July, they vigorously launched mass-based technical operation performance competitions, and furnace chief versus furnace chief, assistant versus assistant competitions. They performed for each other, learned from each other, and helped each other, generally improving their technical operation levels. More than half of the workers, who are new workers, are now basically able to operate independently. In the operation performance competitions focusing on furnace maintenance and repair in the early and middle parts of July, due to the improved operational level and shortened repair time, the utilization rate in early July increased by 1.84% compared to June, and in mid-July it increased by 2.05% compared to the early part of the month, resulting in a steady increase in steel production. After the workers of No. 22 open-hearth furnace launched a competition against No. 20 and No. 21 furnaces, they widely organized operation performances for furnace maintenance, improving the efficiency of maintenance work. At the same time, they promoted advanced experience in rapid steelmaking, shortening the average smelting time for each furnace of steel by one hour and twenty-five minutes compared to the planned target. The entire furnace completed the July steel production plan five days ahead of schedule. After No. 23 and No. 24, two sister furnaces, launched a competition, they held daily technical operation performances for various types of work, and production levels continued to rise. As a result, they both completed the July production plan three days ahead of schedule.

Through technical operation performance competitions, the workers of these five large open-hearth furnaces established and improved rules and regulations, strengthening enterprise management, including furnace repair quality systems, refractory material classification management systems, and thermal management systems. Personnel from various departments also went deep into the field, and, based on the issues raised in the operation performance competitions, helped the workers organize special forums, revise rules and regulations, and continuously improve production order.

Currently, the workers are continuing to carry out technical operation performance competitions, determined to increase the production of more high-quality steel in the last two days of July, laying the foundation for overfulfilling the third quarter plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th: The workers of Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant completed the July steel production plan four days ahead of schedule, with a steel ingot acceptance rate of 97.49%.

Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant is Tianjin's oldest converter steel plant. In 1958, it was rated as a municipal model factory. From January to May of this year, the quality of the plant's steel ingots has been steadily rising, leading the three converter steel plants in the city. However, since the city's three converter steel plants launched an inter-factory competition in June, the plant was quickly surpassed by Tianjin No. 4 Steel Plant and No. 2 Steel Plant: in the three evaluations in June, it was ranked last. At the beginning of July, the plant's workers examined their complacency and sent people to Tianjin No. 4 Steel Plant to learn advanced experiences three times in a row. At the same time, they also formulated unified operating procedures and operating points based on the operating experience of the plant's advanced groups and brother factories in major processes such as oven heating, furnace building, steelmaking, casting, and iron smelting. In addition, they also converted all seven iron smelting furnaces into alkaline iron smelting furnaces, enabling the desulfurization efficiency of the iron smelting furnaces to quickly increase from 50% to about 80%. Due to the adoption of the above measures, the plant quickly saw a new situation of daily over-production of steel and a soaring improvement in quality. As a result, it won the red flag in the city's inter-factory steelmaking competition for two consecutive ten-day periods in July.

    提前完成七月计划　胜利投入八月战斗
    鞍钢五大平炉优质钢优质高产
    天津第三钢厂虚心学习先进经验生产迅速出现新局面
    新华社鞍山29日电　鞍钢五座大型固定式平炉的职工，开展技术操作表演竞赛，挖掘企业内部潜力，使7月份优质钢生产计划提前两天多完成。据1日到28日统计，每天的钢产量平均比6月份增加三百七十四吨。
    这五座大型平炉在上半年提前完成计划以后，职工们总结了前一阶段的生产经验，进入7月份便蓬蓬勃勃地展开了群众性的技术操作表演竞赛，和炉长对炉长、助手对助手的对手竞赛。他们互相表演，互相学习，互相帮助，使技术操作水平普遍提高，占职工总数一半以上的新工人已经基本上能够独立操作，在上旬和中旬开展的以炉体维护检修为中心的操作表演竞赛中，由于操作水平提高了，修炉时间缩短了，7月上旬的作业率比6月份提高1.84％，7月中旬又比上旬提高2.05％，因而钢的产量稳步上升。二十二号平炉的职工与二十号、二十一号平炉开展对手竞赛后，广泛地组织维护炉体的操作表演，提高维护工作效率，同时推广快速炼钢先进经验，使每一炉钢的平均熔炼时间比计划指标缩短一小时二十五分钟，全炉7月份的产钢计划提前五天完成。二十三号和二十四号两个姐妹炉开展对手竞赛后，天天举行各工种技术操作表演，生产水平不断上升，结果都提前三天完成了7月份的产钢计划。
    这五座大型平炉的职工，通过技术操作表演竞赛活动，建立和健全了规章制度，加强了企业管理，其中包括修炉质量制度，耐火材料分级管理制度，热工管理制度等等。各科室的人员也都深入现场，根据在操作表演竞赛中提出的问题，帮助工人们组织专题鸣放，修订规章制度，使生产秩序越来越好。
    现在，职工们正在继续开展技术操作表演竞赛，决心在7月份的最后两天增产更多的优质钢，为超额完成第三季度计划打下基础。
    新华社天津29日电　天津第三钢厂职工提前四天完成了7月份的产钢计划，钢锭合格率达到97.49％。
    天津第三钢厂是天津市最老的转炉炼钢厂，1958年曾被评为市级模范工厂。今年1月到5月，这个厂的钢锭质量也是一直稳步上升，在全市三个转炉炼钢厂中领先。可是从6月份全市三个转炉炼钢厂开展厂际竞赛以后，这个厂很快就被天津第四钢厂和第二钢厂越过去了：6月份的三次评比，都被列入末位。7月初，这个厂的职工检查了自满情绪，连续三次派人到天津第四钢厂学习先进经验，同时在烤炉、砌炉、炼钢、浇铸、化铁等主要工序方面，都根据本厂各先进小组及兄弟工厂的操作经验，统一制订了操作规程和操作要点。此外，他们还把七个化铁炉全部改装为碱性化铁炉，使化铁炉的脱硫效率由50％很快提高到80％左右。由于采取了以上的措施，全厂迅速出现了钢产量日日超额、质量扶摇直上的新局面，因而7月份连续两旬都获得了全市炼钢厂厂际竞赛的红旗。
