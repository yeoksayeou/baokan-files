Adhering to Regulations Ensures Safe Driving
Beijing Qinghe Automobile Depot Achieves Over 13 Million Kilometers of Safe Driving in Three Years

(Our newspaper reports) The Qinghe Automobile Depot of the Beijing Transportation Company, by consistently implementing a comprehensive set of safe driving regulations based on the principle of "prevention first, emphasizing prevention over cure," has achieved over 13.326 million kilometers of safe driving in three years with its 127 trucks, without a single casualty accident. It has continuously won the red flag for safe driving in the city.

The Qinghe Automobile Depot was newly built three years ago. Half of its vehicles are old cars from twenty years ago, and most of the areas they drive through are densely populated streets. Shortly after the depot was established, the leadership focused on safe transportation. When assigning tasks and inspecting production, they simultaneously assigned and inspected driving safety. They mobilized the masses to formulate a set of "prevention first" safe driving regulations from the bottom up and continuously educated drivers on the importance of safe driving.

The main experience of this depot in preventing traffic accidents is to grasp the two key elements: "vehicles in good condition" and "drivers highly skilled." For three years, they have steadfastly implemented the safe driving responsibility system, implementing a vehicle inspection system that combines self-inspection, mutual inspection, and professional institution inspection. Drivers regularly self-inspect the effectiveness of various braking components and major components. When vehicles leave and enter the depot each day, safety inspectors check the vehicle's braking and trailer condition at the gate; if brake or other components are found to be malfunctioning, the vehicle is only allowed to depart after repairs are completed. Every two days, safety inspectors patrol the routes, immediately requiring drivers to stop and repair any faulty components they discover, and immediately stopping any speeding or other phenomena, while also providing safe driving education to drivers. Every seven days, drivers, technicians, and leading cadres conduct a joint safety inspection to identify and resolve problems in a timely manner. In terms of vehicle management, systems such as dedicated vehicles for dedicated trailers and dedicated personnel for the maintenance of locomotives and trailers are implemented, keeping the vehicle utilization rate consistently above 97.6%. This depot has never had a traffic accident due to malfunctioning components.

Regarding "drivers highly skilled," this depot, through established systems such as pre-driving briefings, safety activity days, pre-holiday safety meetings, and family forums, ensures that every driver can concentrate and prioritize safety while driving. The pre-driving briefing is conducted by the squad leader based on weather, road conditions, and the day's transportation tasks, outlining safety measures to increase drivers' vigilance against accidents. Safety activity days are held once a week, mainly to review the week's safe transportation situation, exchange safe driving experiences, and criticize complacency and paralysis. The content of pre-holiday safety meetings focuses on the dense pedestrian and vehicle traffic during holidays, discussing possible accidents and prevention methods. Family forums are held to publicize the importance of safe driving to drivers, enterprises, and society, so that families can take care of drivers, ensuring they get enough sleep and food, and guaranteeing that drivers are energetic while driving. The depot's leaders also frequently go to the front lines to understand the drivers' thoughts, work, and living conditions, educating drivers who neglect safety regulations or are proud and complacent and drive too fast, and helping drivers solve problems such as family discord or financial difficulties.

To prevent unexpected accidents that may occur while driving, the depot has established technical training classes to provide short-term rotational training for drivers to improve their skills in dealing with emergencies. Their depot has also promoted many operating methods to ensure safe driving. Because drivers conscientiously follow these operating methods for medium-speed driving, they avoided a total of sixteen major casualty accidents from January to May this year. For example, in late April, driver Guan Qingchun was driving on Beilishi Road when a child suddenly ran across the road and fell in front of the car. Because the car was driving at a medium speed, the driver was able to brake urgently. After the car stopped, the child was only about one foot away from the front wheel.

    坚持制度  行车安全
    北京清河汽车场三年安全行车一千三百多万公里
    本报讯　北京市运输公司清河汽车场坚持执行“预防为主，防重于治”的一整套安全行车制度，三年来，全车场的一百二十七辆卡车行驶一千三百二十六万多公里，没有发生一件伤亡事故，连续获得全市安全行车的红旗。
    清河汽车场是三年前新建的车场，车辆中有二分之一是二十年前的旧车，行驶的地区大部分是人烟稠密的街道。建场不久，车场的领导人员就抓紧了安全运输，他们在布置任务、检查生产的时候，都同时布置和检查行车安全。他们发动群众自下而上地制订了一套“预防为主”的安全行车制度，并且不断地向司机进行重视安全行车的教育。
    这个车场预防交通事故的主要经验，是抓住“车完好”、“人精锐”两个关键。三年来，他们坚定不移地贯彻了安全行车责任制，对车辆实行自行检查、互相检查和专业机构检查相结合的检查制度。司机随时自行检查各种制动机件和主要机件的效能。每天汽车出场、入场时，都由安全检查员在门口检查车辆的制动和挂车的情况；发现刹车等机件失灵，修好以后再准出车。每隔两天，安全检查员在线路上巡回检查一次，发现机件不好就立即要求司机停车修理，发现开快车等现象就立即制止，并且对司机进行安全行车教育。每隔七天，由司机、技术人员和领导干部共同进行一次安全大检查，发现问题，及时解决。在车辆管理方面，实行专车专斗（拖车）、专人专车保养机车和拖车等制度，使出车率经常保持在97.6％以上。这个车场从来没有因机件不灵而发生交通事故。
    在“人精锐”方面，这个车场通过已经形成制度的车前讲话、安全活动日、节日前夕安全会、家属座谈会等，保证每个司机在驾驶时都能精神集中，重视安全。车前讲话由小队长根据天气、道路等情况，结合当天的运输任务，布置安全措施，提高司机对事故的警惕性。安全活动日每周举行一次，主要是检查一周安全运输情况，交流安全行车经验，批判自满麻痹情绪。节日前夕安全会的内容，是针对节日期间街道行人车辆稠密的情况，讨论可能发生的车祸和防止的办法。家属座谈会是向家属宣传安全行车对司机、企业、社会的重要性，使家属们都能照顾司机睡好吃好，保证司机在驾驶时精力充沛。这个车场的领导人员还经常深入现场了解司机的思想、工作和生活情况，对忽视安全制度、骄傲自满开快车的司机进行教育，帮助司机解决家庭不和睦或生活困难等问题。
    为了预防在行车时可能发生的意料不到的事故，这个车场举办了技术训练班，对司机进行短期轮训，提高司机应付突发事故的技能。他们车场还推广了许多保证安全驾驶的操作方法。司机们由于认真根据这些操作方法进行中速驾驶，今年1月到5月，总共避免了十六起重大伤亡事故。例如，4月下旬，司机管庆春驾车在北礼士路行驶，突然有一个小孩横穿马路猛跑，摔倒在汽车前面，由于汽车中速行驶，司机能够紧急刹车。车停住以后，小孩离前轮只有一市尺左右。
