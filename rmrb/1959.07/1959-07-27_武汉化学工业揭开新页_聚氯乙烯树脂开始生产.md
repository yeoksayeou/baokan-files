According to the Changjiang Daily: The Wuhan Jianhua Chemical Plant has begun producing a new type of synthetic plastic raw material - polyvinyl chloride resin.

Polyvinyl chloride resin is a relatively new plastic raw material with good performance, easy processing, and low price. It has the highest output and the widest application in the world's plastics industry. Plastics are extracted from carbon-containing minerals using synthetic chemical methods. Plastics are named for their plasticity. This material can be processed into various items after treatment. It has properties such as insulation, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and pressure resistance. Therefore, it has a wide range of uses in industry and people's lives.

Jianhua Chemical Plant is the first factory in Wuhan to produce polyvinyl chloride resin. It began preparations for construction in the second half of last year. The designed capacity of all equipment is 200 tons per year. Calculated according to the designed capacity, the annual output can be processed into 1.8 million raincoats. If molded into industrial pipes with an inner diameter of 38 mm and a wall thickness of 5 mm, more than 200,000 meters can be produced, replacing 1,100 tons of steel. The production of polyvinyl chloride resin marks a major step forward in Wuhan's chemical industry in heavy organic synthesis industry.

Currently, the first batch of polyvinyl chloride raw materials, after being processed by Wuhan Battery Factory and Hanchang Chemical Plant, have been used to trial-produce various hard pipes, soft pipes, films, and artificial leather.

    武汉化学工业揭开新页
    聚氯乙烯树脂开始生产
    据长江日报讯　武汉市建汉化工厂开始生产一种新型的合成塑料原料——聚氯乙烯树脂。
    聚氯乙烯树脂是一种较新颖的、性能良好、容易加工、价格低廉的塑料原料，在世界塑料工业中产量最高，应用最广泛。塑料是用合成的化学方法，从含碳的矿物中提取出来的。塑料因为它的可塑性而得名，这种材料经处理后可以制成各种物品，它具有绝缘、耐磨、耐腐蚀、耐压等性能，因此在工业上和人民生活上有着广泛的用途。
    建汉化工厂是武汉市第一个生产聚氯乙烯树脂的工厂，去年下半年开始筹建，全部设备设计能力年产两百吨。按设计能力计算，全年产量如果加工制成雨衣可作一百八十万件，如果塑成内径三十八毫米、壁厚五毫米的工业管道，可制二十多万米，可代替一千一百吨钢材。聚氯乙烯树脂投入生产，标志着武汉市化学工业在重有机合成工业上又迈进了一大步。
    现在，第一批聚氯乙烯原料，经过武汉电池厂和汉昌化工厂加工后，已试制出各种硬管、软管、薄膜和人造革。
