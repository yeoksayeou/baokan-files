Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 11th July: Ulaanbaatar held a mass rally, military parade, and mass parade this morning to celebrate the 38th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution.

    The celebration rally began at 10:00 am in Sukhbaatar Square. Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and state leaders Tsedenbal, Sambuu, Tsende, and others reviewed the parade of the People's Army and the working people of Ulaanbaatar from the rostrum.

    Minister of Military Affairs of Mongolia and Commander of the People's Army, Lieutenant General Lkhagvasuren, spoke at the celebration.

    Lkhagvasuren said that in the 38 years since the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution, the Mongolian people have made tremendous achievements in economic and cultural construction. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in March this year summarized Mongolia's socialist construction and pointed out new goals for accelerating the socialist construction of the motherland to the people of the whole country. Lkhagvasuren said that Mongolia has always firmly pursued a peaceful foreign policy. Over the past thirty-eight years, Mongolia has also achieved brilliant achievements in diplomacy, and its international status is steadily increasing. He said, let us hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and strive to accelerate socialist construction and successfully complete the three-year construction plan.

    Then, the march-past began. The troops of the Mongolian People's Army marched past the reviewing stand in neat steps. Subsequently, tractors towed artillery slowly across the square.

    After the military parade, the mass parade began. Workers in the parade held up charts and models illustrating the completion of production targets, and students carried charts showing their achievements in studying Marxist-Leninist theory and science, chanting slogans as they passed the reviewing stand, accepting the review of party and state leaders.

    The celebration parade ended at 12:00 noon.

    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 11th July: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, Tsedenbal, held a grand banquet tonight to celebrate the 38th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution.

    Those present at the banquet included Sambuu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Khural of Mongolia, Tsende, Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, and other party and government leaders.

    Also present at the banquet were diplomatic envoys from various countries to Mongolia.

    At the banquet, Tsedenbal and other Mongolian party and government leaders raised their glasses to each other, congratulating the Mongolian people on their festival. The banquet was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th July: The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published an editorial today supporting the People's Republic of Mongolia's entry into the United Nations.

    The editorial, after praising the construction achievements of the Mongolian people in recent years, pointed out that the People's Republic of Mongolia is an independent, sovereign country that pursues a peaceful foreign policy. The People's Republic of Mongolia has been recognized by many countries accounting for the majority of the world's population. At the same time, the People's Republic of Mongolia has also made valuable contributions to the cause of defending world peace.

    The editorial said: "The People's Republic of Mongolia is fully qualified to become a member of the United Nations, and it fully possesses all the conditions to undertake the obligations of a member state. It is only due to the obstruction of some cold war elements in the United Nations that the People's Republic of Mongolia has not yet obtained a legitimate seat in the United Nations. This is one of the very unfair situations created by American imperialism and its accomplices. This situation will only weaken the credibility of the United Nations."

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th July: Pyongyang newspapers published editorials today congratulating and commemorating the National Day of the People's Republic of Mongolia and "Mongolia Day." The editorial of the Korean "Rodong Sinmun" said that the people of Asian and African countries, including the Korean people, and peace-loving people all over the world are responding to the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, commemorating the National Day of the Mongolian people as "Mongolia Day," and actively supporting the legitimate demand of the People's Republic of Mongolia to enter the United Nations.

    The editorial said that brilliant achievements have been made on the vast land of Mongolia in the 38 years since the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution. These brilliant achievements made by the Mongolian people and the consistent peace-loving policy of the government of the People's Republic of Mongolia have infinitely enhanced the international prestige of the People's Republic of Mongolia.

    Xinhua News Agency, 11th July: Tokyo dispatch: Forty prominent figures from political, business, and cultural circles in Japan held a "Mongolia Day" gathering in Tokyo on the 10th.

    Nagano Kunisuke, Chairman of the Japan Asian-African Solidarity Committee, Kazami Akira, Director-General of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, and Kitamura Tokutaro, a prominent figure in Japanese society, participated in this gathering held in response to the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council.

    In a telegram to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Mongolia, the gathering stated that the Japanese people will do everything possible to restore diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Mongolia and support Mongolia's membership in the United Nations.

    勒哈格瓦苏伦说，蒙古人民革命胜利三十八年来，蒙古人民在经济和文化建设中取得了巨大的成就。蒙古人民革命党中央委员会今年3月全体会议总结了蒙古的社会主义建设并且向全国人民指出了加快祖国社会主义建设的新目标。勒哈格瓦苏伦说，蒙古一贯坚定不移地奉行和平外交政策，三十八年来，蒙古在外交方面也取得了光辉的成就，它的国际地位正日益提高。他说，让我们高举着马克思列宁主义的旗帜，为加快社会主义建设、为胜利完成三年建设计划而努力。
    接着，分列式开始。蒙古人民军部队迈着整齐的步伐走过检阅台。随后，牵引车牵引着大炮从广场上徐徐而过。
    阅兵结束后，群众游行开始。游行队伍中的职工们高举着说明完成生产情况的图表和模型，学生们抬着说明自己在学习马克思列宁主义理论和科学方面的成绩的图表，欢呼着口号从检阅台前走过，接受党和国家领导人的检阅。

    新华社河内11日电　越南“人民报”今天发表社论，支持蒙古人民共和国加入联合国。
    社论在赞扬了蒙古人民近年来的建设成就以后指出，蒙古人民共和国是独立、有主权、奉行和平外交政策的国家。蒙古人民共和国得到了占全世界大半数人口的许多国家的承认。同时，蒙古人民共和国对保卫世界和平事业也作出了宝贵的贡献。
  社论说：“蒙古人民共和国完全有资格成为联合国的会员国，它完全具备承担会员国义务的一切条件，由于联合国的一些冷战分子的阻挠，才使得蒙古人民共和国至今还没有在联合国中取得合法席位。这是美帝国主义和它的帮凶所制造的非常不公平的情况之一。这种情况只会削弱联合国的威信。”
    新华社平壤11日电　平壤各报今天发表社论，祝贺和纪念蒙古人民共和国国庆和“蒙古日”。朝鲜“劳动新闻”的社论说，包括朝鲜人民在内的亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都响应亚非人民团结理事会的号召，把蒙古人民的国庆日当作“蒙古日”来纪念，积极支持蒙古人民共和国进入联合国的正当要求。
    社论说，蒙古人民革命胜利三十八年来在蒙古的广阔大地上取得了灿烂的成就。蒙古人民所取得的这些灿烂成就和蒙古人民共和国政府一贯的爱好和平政策，无限地提高了蒙古人民共和国在国际上的威信。
