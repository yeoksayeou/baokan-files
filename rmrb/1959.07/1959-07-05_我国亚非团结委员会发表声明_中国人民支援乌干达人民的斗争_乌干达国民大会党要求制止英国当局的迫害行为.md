    China-Africa Solidarity Committee Issues Statement
    Chinese People Support the Ugandan People's Struggle
    Uganda National Congress Party Demands Cessation of Persecution by British Authorities

    This newspaper reports that the China-Africa Solidarity Committee issued a statement on July 4 regarding the "Day of Support for the Ugandan People." The full text is as follows:

    The China-Africa Solidarity Committee enthusiastically responds to the call of the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council to hold a "Day of Support for the Ugandan People" on July 5.

    The Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the Ugandan people against colonial rule and for national independence, and express their highest respect to the heroic Ugandan people.

    British colonialists have long enslaved and oppressed the Ugandan people. Recently, they declared a "state of emergency" in Uganda, adopting terrorist measures and intensifying brutal suppression against the Ugandan people, attempting to block the rising struggle of the Ugandan people for national independence and threatening the national independence movement of the people of East and Central Africa. The Chinese people solemnly condemn and protest against this barbaric act of the British colonialists, which violates the freedom and will of the Ugandan and broad African people, and firmly demand that the British colonialists immediately end their criminal rule over Uganda.

    We are pleased to see that the Ugandan people's struggle against colonial rule has made extensive progress recently after long-term, unyielding efforts. This struggle of the Ugandan people for an end to colonial rule is converging with the surging African national independence movement, forming an irresistible torrent. The Chinese people, who have suffered deeply from imperialist oppression, have always sympathized with the just struggle of the Ugandan people and will forever stand with the Ugandan people and the African people in the common cause of opposing imperialism and defending peace. We firmly believe that in today's world, where the forces of peace are unprecedentedly strong and the people of Asia and Africa are increasingly awakened, the Ugandan people, as long as they strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, will surely be able to break free from colonial rule and achieve the final victory in the cause of national liberation.

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 3rd - John Kale, Foreign Affairs Secretary of the Uganda National Congress, yesterday sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, requesting him to intervene to stop the British colonial authorities from persecuting Ugandan citizens and to use his influence to force Britain to lift the "state of emergency" in Uganda, to force Britain to respect Ugandan civil rights and other basic rights, and to force Britain to begin negotiations with Ugandan political parties on the basis of realizing Ugandan freedom.

    The telegram stated that the "state of emergency" declared by the British colonial authorities in Uganda, and the ensuing political evils and imperialist terror, clearly demonstrate that the Uganda National Congress's repeated requests for UN intervention are correct.

    The telegram also said that the repressive measures taken by Britain in Uganda are an open disregard for the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It also said that the Ugandan people oppose the British claim that the so-called Ugandan issue is an internal British problem.

    我国亚非团结委员会发表声明
    中国人民支援乌干达人民的斗争
    乌干达国民大会党要求制止英国当局的迫害行为
    本报讯　中国亚非团结委员会7月4日发表了关于“支援乌干达人民日”的声明，全文如下：
    中国亚非团结委员会热烈响应亚非人民团结理事会常设书记处关于在7月5日举行“支援乌干达人民日”的号召。
    中国人民完全支持乌干达人民反对殖民统治和争取民族独立的正义斗争，并且向英勇的乌干达人民表示崇高的敬意。
    英国殖民主义者长期奴役和压榨乌干达人民。最近又在乌干达宣布“紧急状态”，对乌干达人民采取恐怖措施和加紧进行残暴镇压，企图阻挡乌干达人民日益高涨的争取民族独立的斗争，并威胁东非和中非人民的民族独立运动。中国人民严正地谴责和抗议英国殖民主义者这种违反乌干达和广大非洲人民自由意志的野蛮行为，并坚决要求英国殖民主义者立即结束对乌干达的罪恶统治。
    我们高兴地看到，乌干达人民反殖民主义统治的斗争，经过长期的不屈不挠的努力，最近取得了广泛的进展。乌干达人民要求结束殖民统治的这一斗争正和风起云涌的非洲民族独立运动汇成了一股无法阻挡的洪流。曾经深受帝国主义压迫的中国人民，一贯同情乌干达人民的正义斗争，并将在反对帝国主义、保卫和平的共同事业中，永远和乌干达人民和非洲人民站在一起。我们深信，在世界和平力量空前强大和亚洲非洲人民日益觉醒的今天，乌干达人民只要加强团结、坚持斗争，就一定能够摆脱殖民主义统治，获得民族解放事业的最后胜利。
    新华社开罗3日电　乌干达国民大会党外事秘书约翰·凯耳昨天致电联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求他进行干预来制止英国殖民当局迫害乌干达公民的行为，并且利用他的影响来迫使英国解除乌干达的“紧急状态”，迫使英国尊重乌干达的公民权和其他基本权利，并且迫使英国在实现乌干达自由的基础上开始同乌干达各政党举行谈判。
    这封电报说，英国殖民当局在乌干达所宣布的“紧急状态”以及随之而来的政治上的罪恶和帝国主义的恐怖清楚地表明，乌干达国民大会党一再要求联合国进行干预的做法是正确的。
    电报还说，英国在乌干达所采取的镇压措施是公开蔑视联合国宪章和人权宣言的行动。它还说，乌干达人民反对英国提出的所谓乌干达问题是英国的内部问题的说法。
