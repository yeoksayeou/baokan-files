Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 29th: Shanghai steel workers have overcome the sweltering heat of July and continuously achieved new successes in high output. In the past twenty-odd days, output has gradually increased. The city's average daily steel production in mid-July increased by 525 tons compared to the first ten days of the month, and the average daily output in the first seven days of the latter half of the month rose by another 239 tons compared to mid-July. The average daily output for these twenty-seven days increased by 5% compared to the same period last month and more than 72% compared to the average daily output in July last year.

Since the beginning of July, the outdoor temperature has frequently been between 35 and 37 degrees Celsius. Despite the operation of all kinds of cooling equipment in the steelmaking workshops, it is still scorching hot. Steelworkers have worked arduously, sticking to their posts, striving to overcome the high temperatures, and striving for high output. Workers at No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 adopted the method of adding materials in five-minute shifts, changing the original method of opening three furnace doors and adding materials by three groups of workers to opening one furnace door and adding materials by one group of workers in a concentrated effort. The other two groups of workers take turns to rest and take turns to work, which not only allows the workers' physical strength to recover but also ensures that the material adding time is not prolonged. Open hearth furnace charging workers at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 are also divided into two teams, one team goes up, and the other team rests. The transportation workers at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 quickly load and transport the high-temperature steel ingots and slag out of the workshop, reducing the pressure of high temperatures on the steelworkers in front of the converter furnace.

In the hot days, the competition between shifts and between furnaces is still very heated. Steelworkers not only compete for high output, high quality, and thrift, but also compete for maintaining equipment and observing operating procedures to extend the life of the converter furnace and strive to have more furnaces for steelmaking. Recently, in order to improve furnace construction technology, various converter workshops mobilized workers to formulate a set of bricklaying operating points and strict inspection systems, which generally extended the life of the converter furnace to thirty or forty heats. Workers in the first converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 strengthened the maintenance of the tuyere, a weak link prone to damage, and measured the tuyere after smelting several heats of steel, so that the average furnace life was extended to more than forty heats. More than 3,700 new cooling equipment have been added to various steel plants this year. Since the beginning of July, various cooling equipment such as spray fans, air showers, and insulated water tanks have been put into operation in front of steelmaking furnaces and on casting floors. Some overhead cranes are equipped with air conditioners, and the temperature in the cab has dropped by nearly ten degrees. Some workshops have also set up air-conditioned rest rooms, where workers take turns to rest and regain their strength after releasing a furnace of steel or adding materials.

The steelworkers' fight against high temperatures has received the kind attention and strong support of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the people of the city. The Municipal Party Committee instructed all steel plants to further improve the work of heat prevention and cooling, and required leading cadres and office personnel of the plants to go to the most tense, hottest, and most difficult places to work with the workers and fight together. Ma Tianshui, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Municipal Party Committee, Zhong Min, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the person in charge of the Municipal Metallurgical Bureau, all went to the brick-making workshop to bake sand, pick sand, and carry bricks with the workers. The Municipal Party Committee also drew more than 700 strong cadres from the two-level organs in the urban area and more than 4,000 workers from various industries to support key steel plants such as Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and No. 3. Workers in cold drink factories are rushing to make soda, popsicles, and other items for steelworkers day and night. Commercial staff actively organized the supply of non-staple foods to ensure that steelworkers eat well. The Shanghai Chorus, Yue Opera Troupe, Huai Opera Troupe, etc., also went to the factories to perform and慰问慰问 the steelworkers who are fighting the high temperatures. With the care and support of the Municipal Party Committee and all parties, the city's steelworkers are in high spirits and determined to continue fighting the high temperatures and ensure that they create greater achievements in the third quarter.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 30th: From July 1st to 28th, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's steel output increased by 10.31% compared with the same period in June, and the qualified rate of steel increased by 5.67%.

This new achievement was obtained by overcoming high temperatures. Chongqing is a famous "hot city," and the indoor temperature in summer often reaches over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. According to this situation, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has increased cooling equipment such as fans in key workshops such as open hearth furnaces, converters, and rolling mills, and established many air showers, water pavilions, etc. The Xiaoping furnace workshop alone installed fourteen air showers; and prepared enough sour plum soup, mung bean soup, salted soda, iced soy milk and other cooling drinks every day. At the same time, a mass heat prevention and cooling competition was launched throughout the company. The Party Secretary and Director of the Da Ping Furnace Plant personally participated in labor, and administrative functional cadres organized service teams to deliver cooling drinks, vegetables and rice to workers in high-temperature workshops. The staff of the auxiliary workshops carried forward the spirit of communist cooperation and formed shock teams to support the steelworkers, giving them ample time to rest. Since July 10th, the company has maintained normal production despite the high temperatures in the workshops.

In July, the company actively strengthened production management and adopted many technical measures. The Da Ping Furnace Plant and another converter workshop built a neutral hot air pig iron melting furnace, and the desulfurization effect was very good after it was put into production. In terms of production management, the company generally established and improved the responsibility system of furnace chiefs, workshop directors, and machine chiefs in July, and strengthened the work of classes and groups, making production organization, leadership, and political and ideological work more in-depth and meticulous, so the workers' enthusiasm for production is getting higher and higher.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 30th: The workers of No. 4 open hearth furnace of Daye Steel Plant overcame the high temperature of midsummer and overfulfilled the July steel production plan three days ahead of schedule. The steel produced from July 1st to 28th was 779 tons more than the total output in June, and the quality of the steel was also improved compared with June.

In July, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River were scorching hot. Although the workshop took many heatstroke prevention and cooling measures, the temperature was still more than 40 degrees Celsius. Under high temperatures, the workers launched a heated socialist labor competition of "high quality, high yield, and multiple varieties." On the 20th, the early shift of Wang Yousheng improved labor organization and strengthened contact with the pig iron melting furnace and gas workshop, creating a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in six hours and fifty-nine minutes. After Jin Yiyuan's and Luo Yongfa's teams learned from their experience, they broke Wang Yousheng's record on the same day with the results of smelting a furnace of steel in six hours and fifty-five minutes and six hours and thirty-six minutes. The average time for these three teams to smelt a furnace of steel in July was greatly shortened compared with June. The workers also summarized the production experience in the first half of the year, strengthened the maintenance of the furnace body, and conscientiously implemented the operating procedures to ensure the quality of the products.

    党委关怀体贴入微　战友支援情意深厚
    钢铁英雄奋战高温夺取高产
    炎夏七月，上海、重庆、大冶钢厂赢得三季度的第一个胜利
    新华社上海29日电　上海钢铁工人7月战胜炎夏高温，不断取得高产的新成绩，二十几天来产量逐步上升。7月中旬全市钢的平均日产量比上旬增加五百二十五吨，下旬前七天的平均日产量又比中旬上升二百三十九吨。这二十七天来的平均日产量比上月同期增长5％，比去年7月平均日产量增长72％以上。
    进入7月以来，室外温度经常在摄氏三十五度到三十七度之间。各炼钢车间尽管各种降温设备一齐开动，仍然是酷热炙人。炼钢工人们艰苦地坚持在工作岗位上，千方百计地制服高温，力争高产。上钢一厂一号平炉的工人采用了五分钟小调班的加料方法，把原来开三个炉门、三批工人加料改为开一个炉门、由一批工人突击加料。另外两批工人轮流休息、轮流上阵，既使工人们的体力得到恢复，又保证了加料时间不拖长。上钢三厂平炉加料工人也分成两队，一队上去，另一队休息。上钢六厂的搬运工人们快装快运，把一车车高热的钢锭和钢渣迅速运出车间，减轻了高温对转炉炉前炼钢工人的压力。
    在炎热的日子里，班与班、炉与炉之间的竞赛仍然十分热烈。炼钢工人们不仅赛高产、赛优质、赛节约，还赛维护设备和遵守操作规程，以延长转炉炉龄，争取有更多的炉子炼钢。最近时期，各转炉车间为了提高砌炉技术，发动工人订出一套打砖的操作要点和严格的检验制度，使转炉炉龄普遍延长到三、四十炉。上钢三厂第一转炉车间工人针对风眼易坏这一薄弱环节，加强了对转炉风眼的维护，炼几炉钢就测量一次风眼，使炉龄平均延长到四十几炉。各钢铁厂今年新添的降温设备达三千七百多台。进入7月以来，炼钢炉前、浇钢场上，喷雾风扇、空气淋浴、隔热水箱等各种降温设备，都已开动。有些行车上装置了冷气机，驾驶室里的气温下降了近十度。有些车间还设立了冷气休息室，工人们放好一炉钢或加完一次料以后，就轮流去休息，恢复体力。
    钢铁工人向高温的战斗，得到中共上海市委和全市人民的亲切关怀和大力支持。市委早就指示各钢铁厂要进一步做好防暑降温工作，要求各厂领导干部和科室人员必须到最紧张、最炎热、最困难的地方去，同工人一起劳动，共同作战。市委书记处书记马天水、市工会联合会主席钟民，以及市冶金局的负责人，都曾下到制砖车间，同工人们一起烘砂、挑砂、担砖。市委还从市区两级机关抽调了七百多名强壮的干部，从各行业抽调了四千多名工人，支援上钢一厂、三厂等重点钢厂。冷饮工厂的工人日夜为钢铁工人赶制汽水、棒冰等。商业工作人员积极组织副食品供应，保证钢铁工人吃好。上海合唱团、越剧团、淮剧团等，也纷纷下厂演出，慰问同高温作战的钢铁工人。全市钢铁工人在市委和各方面的关怀和支援下，意气风发，决心继续向高温作战，保证在第三季度创造更大的成绩。
    新华社重庆30日电　重庆钢铁公司7月1日到28日的钢产量，比6月份同期增加了10.31％，钢的合格率提高了5.67％。
    这个新的成绩是在战胜高温的情况下获得的。重庆是一个著名的“热城”，夏季室内气温经常达到华氏一百度以上。重庆钢铁公司根据这一情况，在平炉、转炉、轧钢等重点车间增加了风扇等降温设备，建立了许多空气淋浴、水凉亭等，仅小平炉车间就安装了空气淋浴十四个；每天准备了足够的酸梅汤、绿豆汤、咸汽水、冰豆浆等清凉饮料。同时，在全公司掀起了群众性的防暑降温竞赛。大平炉厂党委书记、厂长亲自参加劳动，行政职能干部组织了服务队，向高温车间工人送清凉饮料和菜饭。辅助车间的职工发扬共产主义协作精神，纷纷组成突击队来支援炼钢工人，使他们有充裕的时间休息。全公司从7月10日以来，尽管车间的温度很高，生产还是正常进行。
    这个公司7月份积极加强了生产管理工作，采取了许多技术措施。大平炉厂和另一个转炉车间建设了一座中性热风化铁炉，投入生产以后脱硫效果很好。在生产管理方面，这个公司7月份普遍建立和健全了炉长、车长和机长负责制度，加强了班、组工作，使生产组织领导和政治思想工作更加深入细致，工人们的生产劲头因此越来越大。
    新华社武汉30日电　大冶钢厂四号平炉职工战胜盛夏高温，提前三天超额完成7月份钢的生产计划。7月1日到28日生产的钢比6月份全月的产量还多七百七十九吨，钢的质量也比6月份提高了。
    7月，长江中游酷热，虽然车间采取了许多防暑降温措施，温度仍然有摄氏四十多度。在高温下，职工们开展了热火朝天的“优质高产多品种”社会主义劳动竞赛。20日，早班王友胜班改善劳动组织，并与化铁炉、煤气车间加强联系，创造了六点五十九分炼一炉钢的新纪录。金益元班和罗永发班学习了他们的经验以后，当天就以六点五十五分、六点三十六分炼一炉钢的成绩打破了王友胜班的纪录。这三个班7月份炼一炉钢的平均时间都比6月份大大缩短。职工们还总结了上半年的生产经验，加强炉体维护工作和认真贯彻执行操作规程，保证了产品质量。（附图片）
