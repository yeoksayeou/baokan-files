A Common Post, Extraordinary Deeds

    Shoe repairman Cai Wenyu served in the army for more than three years. He was a gunner, a cook, a pig breeder, and a shoe repairman. He also learned how to cut hair and mend clothes. Whatever task the leadership assigned him, he would do it happily and excel at everything.
    Initially, when Cai Wenyu was a gunner, he achieved excellent and good grades in all his studies and became a training pacesetter. Later, when the company lacked a cook, some people were afraid of getting dirty and tired and were unwilling to do it. He said he was willing to go. One day, while he was cooking, the regiment's quartermaster director came and asked him if he knew how to repair shoes. He said that he had been a worker since he was a child and had made cloth shoes. The director told him that some people thought that after joining the army, they shouldn't carry guns and cannons, and repairing worn-out shoes was "not honorable." He said he didn't think that way and was willing to do it. Although this skill was not unfamiliar to him, he had never repaired rubber shoes, leather shoes, uppers, or soles. So he ran around, found shoe stores and repair stalls, and learned from experienced craftsmen. In less than half a year, he could skillfully repair all kinds of shoes. In the past, shoe repairmen had a rule that broken shoes had to be brought to them collectively and had to be clean and odorless. He said this was unreasonable, so he carried his toolbox and went from one company to another, delivering the repair service to their doorsteps. At one time, the troops were stationed in dispersed locations, dozens of miles apart. He often braved wind and snow, traveling from one mountain to another. Without a workshop, he set up his stall in the open air. When the wind was too strong, he found a valley. His hands were chapped and his fingers were frozen, but he rubbed them and continued working. In January of this year, the troops were about to depart, and there were three hundred pairs of broken shoes to be repaired. Time was tight and there were many shoes. He stayed in the workshop for several days, working tirelessly late into the night with his hands flying. In shoe repair, he tried every means to save new leather, and the discarded tires and broken ball skins were always soaked and hammered and used in the new materials. In January of this year, the Party committee of his unit accepted him as a member of the Chinese Communist Party.

### 补鞋送上门

    补鞋送上门
    鞋工蔡稳玉，参军三年多，当过炮手，烧过饭，养过猪，补过鞋，还学会了理发、补衣服。上级叫他干什么，他就愉快地去干什么，而且样样干得都很出色。
    开始，蔡稳玉当炮手，学习成绩门门是优秀、良好，成了训练标兵。以后，连里缺炊事员，有人怕脏怕累不愿干，他说他愿去。一天，他正在做饭，团里军需主任来了，问他会不会补鞋，他说他从小当工人，做过布鞋。主任告诉他有人认为参军后不能扛枪操炮，补破鞋“不光采”。他说他不是这样想，他愿干。这门手艺，他虽然不陌生，可是修胶鞋、补皮鞋、上帮、换底没干过，于是他就东奔西跑，找皮鞋店、补鞋摊，拜师学艺，不到半年就能熟练地补各种鞋了。过去，鞋工订了条规矩，破鞋要集中送来，而且要不脏不臭。他说这不合理，背起工具箱，从这个连到那个连，送到门上去补。有个时期，部队驻地分散，相隔几十里，他经常冒着风雪，从这个山头到那个山头。没有工棚，他露天摆摊，风太大，他找个山凹，手吹裂了，指头冻僵了，他搓搓再干。今年1月，部队要出发，有三百双破鞋要补。时间紧，鞋子多，他连续几天寸步不离工棚，深夜还在工棚里双手如梭，飞快工作。在修鞋中，他想尽办法节省新皮子，拾来的断车胎、破球皮，总是泡泡捶捶，夹在新料中使用。今年1月，他所在部队党委接受他为中共党员。
