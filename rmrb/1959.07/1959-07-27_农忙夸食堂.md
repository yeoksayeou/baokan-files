    Praising the Canteen During the Busy Farming Season
    Zhou Xingqin
    I am a female commune member of the Jinxing Production Team, Hushan Commune, Cixi County, Zhejiang Province. Since our production team established a public canteen, I have been freed from the trouble of dealing with pots and stoves three times a day and have happily participated in agricultural production. From January of this year to the present, I have earned 1,146 work points, which is double the amount I earned in the same period last year.
    In the past, during the busy days of summer harvesting and planting, I wanted to spare some time to help in the fields, but I had to cook three meals a day, and the time spent going back and forth was considerable, without much help to production. Sometimes I came home a little late, and the children were crying with hunger. Hearing the children cry, I felt extremely anxious. I hurriedly started a fire to cook, but the rice was either raw or hard, which made the whole family unhappy and affected our enthusiasm for production. Now, things are much better. The canteen cooks all three meals for us, and when it's time to eat, we walk into the canteen and the aroma of rice fills our nostrils, making us have a great appetite.
    Currently, it is the busy season of summer harvesting and planting. Our canteen cooks are even more considerate. In addition to cooking for us every day, they also add fresh vegetables and boil water for us so that we always have water to drink. Everything is arranged so well for us that we don't have to worry about anything ourselves. This is so touching. Whenever I think of the benefits of the canteen, I feel full of energy.

### 农忙夸食堂

    农忙夸食堂
    周杏琴
    我是浙江慈溪县浒山公社金星生产队的女社员。自从我们生产队里办起公共食堂以后，我解脱了一日三次和锅灶打交道的麻烦，愉快地参加了农业生产。今年一月起到现在为止，我已做了一千一百四十六个工分，比去年同期多做了一倍。
    过去，每到紧张的夏收夏种的日子，想抽身到田里去帮个忙，可是一天要烧三餐饭，再加路上来来去去，花的时间倒不少，生产的忙却没有帮上。有时回家稍微晚了一点，孩子饿得直哭。一听小孩哭，心里急得什么似的。慌慌张张地引火烧饭，烧出来的饭不是生就是僵，一家人心里都不高兴，生产劲头也受影响。现在可好了，一日三餐食堂替我们烧得好好的，吃饭时间一到，走进食堂，一股饭香直往人的鼻子里钻，胃口特别好。
    目前，正是紧张的夏收夏种季节。我们的食堂炊事员同志更想得周到，他们除了每天为我们烧饭以外，还增加了新鲜的蔬菜，并且替我们烧开水，使我们常常有水喝。一切都给我们安排得好好的，自己一点也不用操心，这种事情太使人感动了。每当想起食堂的好处，我就觉得浑身都是劲。
