    Pay Attention to Protecting Women's Health
    Currently, the southern provinces are rushing to harvest early rice and transplant late rice, and labor is very tight. At the same time, female commune members are very active in going to work after being freed from household chores. In this situation, more attention should be paid to the protection of female labor. Some places are doing this work very well. For example, the Xinmin Production Team of Xishui Commune in Hubei Province stipulates that pregnant women are not assigned heavy work, women during their menstrual period do not go into paddy fields, nursing mothers are assigned nearby work, and weak female commune members are assigned to do threshing ground work and seed selection. This arrangement not only meets the needs of various aspects of agricultural work, but also greatly improves the labor enthusiasm of female commune members.
    In some places, when agricultural work is busy, cadres are busy with this and that, and inadvertently neglect the special difficulties of female commune members. This is not good. Women are a huge force in rural areas, and protecting and rationally using female labor is an important task in organizing production well. Therefore, I suggest that Party organizations in various localities pay attention to checking this issue during the "double rush" period so that female commune members can play a greater role in production.

    注意保护妇女健康
    目前，南方各省正在抢收早稻、抢播晚稻，劳力非常紧张；同时女社员们在解脱了家务劳动以后，出工也非常积极。在这种情况下，应当更多注意女劳力的保护问题。有些地方这个工作做得很好。如湖北浠水公社新民生产队规定孕妇不派重活，月经期不下水田，喂奶的妇女安排近活，体弱的女社员分配干晒场、选种等活。这样安排既适应农活多方面的需要，也能大大提高女社员的劳动积极性。
    有些地方农活一忙，干部忙这忙那，无形中就忽视了妇女社员的特殊困难。这是不好的，妇女是农村一支巨大的力量，保护和合理使用妇女劳动力，正是组织好生产的一项重要工作。因此，我建议各地党组织在双抢期间注意检查一下这个问题，使女社员能在生产中发挥更大的作用。
