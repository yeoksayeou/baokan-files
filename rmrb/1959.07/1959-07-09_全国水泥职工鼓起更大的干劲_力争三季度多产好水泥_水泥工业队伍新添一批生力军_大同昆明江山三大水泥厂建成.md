Xinhua News Agency, July 8th—Cement industry workers nationwide, having achieved significant results in the high-quality, high-yield campaign during the second quarter, are prepared to exert even greater efforts in the third quarter, engaging in a three-month battle to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day with new achievements of abundant production.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the twenty-nine key cement plants across the country produced 320,000 tons more cement in the second quarter than in the first quarter, an increase of 12.94% compared to the same period last year. The quality of the products has also improved. The average grade of cement leaving the factory in the first quarter of this year was 385 (the average compressive strength of cement per square centimeter was 385 kilograms), which rose to over 400 in May and June.

Establishing and improving a series of rules and regulations to ensure output and quality, and strengthening enterprise planning management, are important experiences for many key cement enterprises to achieve high quality and high yield. For example, the Liulihe Cement Plant adopted a method combining leadership and the masses, compiling monthly, ten-day, and daily work plans from the factory and workshops to the teams. Based on the problems in executing the work plans, they promptly scheduled and organized collaboration. This year, they overfulfilled the plan every month, and basically no substandard cement was produced. The Harbin Cement Plant mobilized the masses to re-examine the original rules and regulations in the first half of the year, establishing a relatively comprehensive quality management method, fundamentally reversing the decline in quality that had occurred last winter. In May and June, more than 70,000 tons of cement leaving the factory had a grade of 500 or higher, reaching 90%.

In the high-quality, high-yield campaign, cement plants in various regions have widely promoted many major technological innovations and advanced experiences that emerged in the cement industry during the Great Leap Forward last year. In particular, the advanced operating experience of "three highs and one fast" (high feed rate, high air volume, high firepower, and fast kiln rotation) has universally improved the production level of cement kilns in various factories. After implementing this experience, the Huaxin Cement Plant's cement kiln output has exceeded the design level. The average hourly output of the plant's No. 1 kiln was only 24 tons in the second half of last year, but now it has increased to 30 tons, and the cement quality has been maintained between 600 and 700 grades for a long time, and it has been operating safely for more than 400 days. According to the requirements of the "three highs and one fast" operation method, the Fushun Cement Plant improved some mechanical and electrical equipment, which increased the output of several cement kilns by about 5% to 20%. The harmful impurities, free lime, contained in the clinker were also generally reduced, which played a good role in the plant's overfulfillment of the second quarter plan and improvement of cement output.

At present, although the national cement industry has achieved great results, there is still a considerable distance compared to the needs of the country, and the quality of cement is not stable enough. In order to consolidate and improve the experience of the high-quality, high-yield campaign in the previous period, and strive to increase the production of more and better cement in the third quarter, the Ministry of Construction Engineering recently convened a national five-level cadre meeting of the cement industry, focusing on improving enterprise management and improving product quality, summarizing and exchanging experiences in planning management, quality management, equipment management, technological innovation, economic accounting, and safe production. It also pointed out that the central task of the cement industry at present is to continue to exert full effort, strengthen management, and engage in large-scale technological innovation, and launch an increase production and practice economy campaign on the principle of ensuring quality. After the meeting, the Ministry of Construction Engineering has dispatched four work groups to various places to help with the work; the factories are also re-arranging the production of the third quarter according to the spirit of the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, July 8th—China's cement industry has recently added a new force, with three new cement kilns in Datong, Kunming, and Jiangshan cement plants put into operation in the first half of the year. The total design capacity of these three cement kilns reaches 450,000 tons, equivalent to about 20% of the total cement production capacity newly added during the first five-year plan.

At the same time that these three cement kilns were completed, fifteen cement plants across the country are stepping up construction, five of which have entered the equipment installation phase and are expected to be put into production soon. These fifteen cement plants are widely distributed. After they are all completed, they will basically change the original situation of China's cement industry being concentrated only in the northeast and southeast coastal provinces. Except for Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Tibet, all other provinces and autonomous regions will have at least one large and medium-sized cement plant with an annual output of more than 100,000 tons of cement, which will play an important role in supporting basic construction in various regions.

Among the fifteen cement plants under construction, Shaanxi Yaoxian and Sichuan Jiangyou Cement Plants are the two largest cement plants in China. Both of these cement plants were designed by China itself. Since construction began in May last year, both plants have basically completed mining construction, railway spur lines, and ancillary buildings. The tall factory buildings have already been erected, and the 150-meter-long wet-process cement kilns are also about to be built. Currently, workers are rushing to build cement storage, preparing to be put into use when the cement kilns are put into production.

### 全国水泥职工鼓起更大的干劲  力争三季度多产好水泥  水泥工业队伍新添一批生力军  大同昆明江山三大水泥厂建成

    全国水泥职工鼓起更大的干劲
    力争三季度多产好水泥
    水泥工业队伍新添一批生力军
    大同昆明江山三大水泥厂建成
    新华社8日讯　全国水泥工业职工在第二季度开展的优质高产运动已取得显著成绩，准备在第三季度内鼓起更大干劲，大战三月，以新的丰产成就迎接国庆十周年。
    据建筑工程部统计，全国二十九个重点水泥厂第二季度比第一季度多生产了三十二万吨水泥，比去年同期增长12.94％。产品的质量也有提高，今年第一季度出厂水泥的平均标号是三百八十五号（平均每平方公分水泥抗压力为三百八十五公斤），到5、6月份已上升到四百号以上。
    建立和健全一系列保证产量和质量的规章制度，加强企业的计划管理，是许多重点水泥企业优质高产的重要经验。如琉璃河水泥厂采取领导和群众相结合的方法，从厂、车间到班组，都按月按旬按日编制作业计划，并且根据执行作业计划中的问题，及时调度和组织协作，今年上半年月月都超额完成了计划，基本上没有出不合格的水泥；哈尔滨水泥厂上半年发动群众重新审查了原有的规章制度，建立了一套比较全面的质量管理办法，根本上扭转了去年冬天曾经一度出现的质量下降现象，5、6月份出厂的七万多吨水泥中，标号在五百号以上的已经达到90％。
    各地水泥厂在优质高产运动中，普遍推广了去年大跃进时水泥工业中出现的许多重大技术革新和先进经验。特别是“三大一快”（加料大、风量大、火力大和快转窑）的先进操作经验，使各厂水泥窑的生产水平普遍提高了一步。华新水泥厂推行了这项经验后，水泥窑的产量都突破了设计水平。这个厂的一号窑去年下半年平均台时产量还只有二十四吨，现在已经提高到三十吨，水泥质量长期保持在六百号到七百号之间，还安全运转了四百多天。抚顺水泥厂根据“三大一快”操作方法的要求，改进了某些机电设备，使几个水泥窑的产量提高了5％到20％左右，熟料中所含的有害杂质游离石灰也普遍减少，对这个厂超额完成第二季度计划和提高水泥产量起了很好的作用。
    目前，全国水泥工业虽然已经取得很大成绩，但是与国家需要比较起来，还有很大距离，水泥的质量也不够稳定。为了巩固和提高前一时期优质高产运动的经验，争取在第三季度增产更多更好的水泥，建筑工程部在不久前召开了全国水泥工业五级干部会议，围绕着改进企业管理和提高产品质量，总结和交流了计划管理、质量管理、设备管理、技术革新、经济核算、安全生产等经验，并且指出：当前水泥工业的中心任务，仍然是继续鼓足干劲，加强管理和大搞技术革新，在保证质量的原则下，开展增产节约运动。会后，建筑工程部已派出四个工作组前往各地帮助工作；各厂也正在根据会议的精神，重新安排第三季度的生产。
    新华社8日讯　我国水泥工业最近增加了一支生力军，大同、昆明、江山三个水泥厂上半年有三座新水泥窑投入生产。这三座水泥窑总设计能力达四十五万吨，相当于第一个五年计划期间新增的全部水泥生产能力的20％左右。
    在这三座水泥窑建成的同时，全国还有十五个水泥厂正在加紧建设，其中有五个已经进入设备安装阶段，预计不久也可以投入生产。这十五个水泥厂分布很广，它们全部建成以后，将基本上改变我国原来水泥工业只集中在东北和东南沿海几省的局面，除了内蒙古、宁夏、青海和西藏以外，其他各省、自治区都将至少有一个年产水泥十万吨以上的大中型水泥厂，这对支援各地基本建设将起重要作用。
    正在建设的十五个水泥厂中，陕西耀县和四川江油水泥厂是我国最大的两个水泥厂。这两个水泥厂都是由我国自己设计的。从去年5月开工到现在，两个厂都基本上完成了矿山建设、铁路专用线和附属建筑等工程，高大的厂房建筑已经矗立起来，长达一百五十米的用湿法生产的水泥窑也快要建设好了。现在，职工们正在突击建筑水泥库，准备在水泥窑投入生产时交付使用。
