    The Problem of Seat Numbering in Cinemas and Theaters
    Hai Muhao
    After reading Comrade Qin Li's article "A Problem in Summer Cinemas and Theaters" in the People's Daily on June 28th, I was also prompted to talk about the issue of seat numbering in cinemas and theaters.

    I remember once going to a cinema in Anshan to watch a movie. Because I have severe nearsightedness, I bought a ticket for a seat in the first row. Unexpectedly, the first row in this cinema was actually the last row of the theater, and its row numbers were counted from back to front, which was different from the usual front-to-back numbering. This situation was not unique. Later, in Urumqi, I saw another cinema that also numbered its seats from back to front.

    Afterward, I took the opportunity of frequently traveling to various places for work to pay some attention to the seat numbering situation in cinemas and theaters. It turned out that the seat numbering methods across the country were extremely inconsistent: some rows were numbered from front to back, some from back to front, some were arranged sequentially from the left or right direction of the stage, and some were numbered separately according to the front, middle, and rear areas. Still others were divided into east, west, north, south, and central zones, or seats were assigned according to categories like A, B, C, and D. The numbering of seats also varied, with some arranged from the middle to the left and right in odd and even numbers, and others sequentially from the left or right... Truly, there was a wide variety of approaches.

    Due to the inconsistency of the numbering, although many cinemas had seating charts, many audience members still had to rush and struggle to find their seats before the show started, increasing the workload of the ushers, and sometimes they couldn't handle it, which affected the order in the theater, disturbed others' viewing, and wasted the time of these audience members.

    Of course, the architecture and seating layout of cinemas and theaters across the country have their own characteristics, and it is difficult and unrealistic to enforce complete uniformity. But it would be best to arrange the seating according to the general public's habits, so as not to leave the audience completely in the dark.

    影剧场的排座编号问题
    海慕豪
    6月28日读了人民日报上秦犁同志关于“夏季影剧场的一个问题”后，引起我也想来谈谈影剧场的排座编号问题。
    记得一次到鞍山一个影院看电影，因为我是深度近视眼，买了第一排座位的票；不料这个影院的第一排是剧场的最后一排，它的排号是从后往前数的，和通常从前往后的习惯排法不一样。事情倒是无独有偶，以后在乌鲁木齐市，又见到一家电影院，也是从后向前排座的。
    以后，我乘经常去各地工作的机会，略为留意了影剧院的排座编号情况。原来，全国各地的影剧院在这方面是极不统一的：排次有从前往后的，也有从后往前的，有从舞台的左或右方向分边顺序排列的，也有按前、中、后地位单独编排的，更有分东西南北中区或按甲乙丙丁划座的；座号的编法也各不相同，有由中间向左右分单双号排列，也有由左或右依序排列的……真是形形色色，不一而足。
    由于编排的不统一，虽然许多影院挂有座次表，但是不少观众也还须在开场前匆忙而又困难的找座，增加领座员的工作，有时还照顾不过来，既影响场内秩序和妨碍别人看戏，又浪费这些观众的时间。
    当然全国各影剧场的建筑与排座布局各有特点，强求统一是有困难也是不现实的。但最好能照一般群众的习惯来编排座次，不要使观众完全摸不着头脑。
