    Improve Sowing Techniques to Save Autumn Vegetable Seeds
    Vegetable Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
    With the rapid expansion of the autumn vegetable planting area this year, the shortage of vegetable seeds has become a prominent problem in increasing autumn vegetable production in many areas. Now that the sowing season for autumn vegetables has arrived, in addition to immediately striving to allocate vegetable seeds from all aspects in various regions (when allocating vegetable seeds between regions, attention must be paid to the characteristics of the varieties), improving sowing techniques, improving sowing methods, and rationally saving seed usage have become the main ways to solve the problem of insufficient vegetable seeds.
    Farmers in North China commonly use direct seeding or seedling transplanting methods to grow Chinese cabbage. Among the direct seeding methods, row sowing is the most common. Although row sowing has the advantages of not easily resulting in missing seedlings and faster sowing speed, it requires a large amount of seeds, about five taels (small taels, same below) of seeds per mu. Some areas also use hole sowing. Hole sowing requires slightly less seed than row sowing, but it is more labor-intensive. The seedlings sown in this way mostly grow on both sides of the ridge, and are prone to tilting when they grow up. Many seedlings must be pulled out during thinning, so some seeds are actually wasted. In addition, in the Sijiqing Commune in the suburbs of Beijing, there is a "poke-hole method" for sowing. This sowing method involves using the back of a hoe to open a shallow ditch of five to six inches long every seven or eight inches apart along the direction of the ridge in the center of the ridge back. When opening the ditch, the back of the hoe is pushed and pulled back and forth once to ensure that the bottom of the ditch is uniform in depth (about four to five fen deep). The seeds are sown in the ditch, with about 20 seeds sown in each hole, requiring three to three and a half taels of seeds per mu. This method uses less seed, requires less labor for thinning, and at the same time, the plant spacing is neat, which can reduce the consumption of land fertility.
    Seedling transplanting is generally used when the previous crop ends late, there is a shortage of labor, land preparation cannot be completed in time, but the sowing period of Chinese cabbage cannot be delayed. This method involves sowing the seeds by scattering or row sowing in well-prepared small plots, and then transplanting when the seedlings have five to six true leaves. The seedling method uses the least amount of seeds, only one and a half to two and a half taels per mu. Because transplanting damages some of the root system of the seedlings, it is necessary to go through a slow seedling stage after transplanting before continuing to grow, so the sowing period should be a few days earlier than direct seeding. However, early sowing and the wounds caused to the roots often favor the occurrence of soft rot and reduce yield, so this method was not promoted in the past.
    From the actual situation, each tael of Chinese cabbage seeds has about 10,000 seeds, while the actual number of seedlings needed per mu is only 2,000 to 4,000; however, the above-mentioned general row sowing requires about five taels of seeds per mu, and even the most economical seedling transplanting method requires as much as one and a half to two and a half taels. From this, it can be seen that the potential for saving seed usage is great. Under the current circumstances of extreme shortage of vegetable seeds, in order to ensure that autumn vegetables can be grown in greater quantity and better quality, it is necessary to improve sowing techniques, improve sowing methods, so as to maximize the utilization efficiency of seeds and save a large amount of seeds to ensure the expansion of the autumn vegetable planting area.
    We believe that saving seed usage is not simply a matter of reducing the amount of sowing, but mainly improving the quality of sowing and cultivation techniques. The vegetable field is leveled and refined, so that water will not accumulate or gaps will form due to uneven soil surface; use poisonous grains and poisonous bait to prevent underground pests during sowing, and strengthen pest control during the seedling stage; apply fermented cake fertilizer and manure before use; sow seeds evenly, and do a good job of soil covering and compaction after sowing; the soil temperature is appropriate during sowing, etc., are all important measures to improve the quality of sowing and ensure full seedlings. In addition, direct-sown Chinese cabbage, radish, and mustard greens can also vigorously promote the "poke-hole method" of sowing. The number of seeds sown in each hole can also be appropriately reduced. In case of missing seedlings, seedlings can be transplanted and replanted. In the past, it was thought that radishes could not be transplanted, and only supplementary sowing was possible after missing seedlings, but supplementary sowing has the disadvantage of uneven plant size. However, according to my experimental results, radish seedlings can still grow well if they are transplanted and replanted with more soil when they have two to four true leaves.
    For Chinese cabbage sown by seedling transplanting, scattering can be changed to row sowing, and it can be sown more sparsely. This can not only save a lot of seeds, but also enable the seedlings to have a suitable nutrient area to grow strong, and also facilitate transplanting with more soil to reduce root damage. Seedling transplanting can timely and conveniently do a good job in pest control of seedlings, and can also use reed curtains to shade in high temperature to reduce the occurrence of viral diseases.
    Carrot is also an important autumn vegetable. Some areas are accustomed to using the scattering method for planting carrots. If the row sowing method is used, the amount of seed used can be saved by more than one-half.
    In short, as long as we strive to improve sowing methods and improve the quality of sowing in all aspects, we can not only save a large amount of seeds to expand the cultivation area, but also promote the healthy growth of seedlings and reduce the labor used for thinning.

    改进播种技术，节约秋菜种籽
    中国农业科学院蔬菜研究所
    随着今年秋菜播种面积的迅速扩大，菜籽不足已成为当前许多地区增产秋菜中的突出问题。现在秋菜的播种时期已到，各地区除了立即从各方面努力调剂菜籽以外（在地区间调剂菜籽，必须注意品种的特性），提高播种技术、改进播种方法、合理节约用籽，已成为解决菜籽不足问题的主要途径。
    华北地区农民常用直播或育苗移栽的方法来种植大白菜。直播方法中以条播法最为普遍。条播虽然具有不易缺苗和播种速度较快的好处，但是它的用种量较多，每亩约需五两（小两，下同）种籽。也有部分地区采用穴播法。穴播的用种量较条播稍少，但费工较多。这样播种的幼苗多在垅的两侧生长，长大后容易歪倒，在间苗时要拔除许多，因此有一部分种籽实际上是浪费了。此外，在京郊四季青公社有采用“戳垵法”播种的。这种播种方法是在垅背中央顺垅的方向用锄背每隔七、八寸远开一个五至六寸长的浅沟，开沟时将锄背来回推拉一次，以便沟底深浅均匀（深约四至五分），将种籽播在沟中，每垵约播种籽二十粒左右，每亩需用种籽三至三两半。这种方法用种量既少，间苗费工也较少，同时株距整齐，可以减少地力的耗费。
    育苗移栽法一般都是在前茬结束较晚、劳动力不足、整地不能及时完成，但又不能延误白菜播种期的情况下采用的。这种方法是将种籽撒播或条播在整好的小畦内，到幼苗有五至六片真叶再行定植。育苗法的用种量最少，每亩只需用种一两半至二两半。因为移栽要损伤幼苗的一部分根群，定植后必需经过一个缓苗阶段才能继续生长，所以播种期要比直播的早几天。但是播期早和根部造成的伤口，往往有利于软腐病的发生，减少产量，所以这种方法过去是不提倡的。
    从实际情况来看，每两白菜种籽约有一万粒左右，而每亩实际需要的苗数却只有二千到四千棵；可是上面所述一般条播每亩用种量约需五两种籽，就是最经济的育苗移栽法也要用一两半到二两半之多。由此可见，节约用种的潜力是很大的。在目前菜种极感不足的情况下，为了保证秋菜能够多种和种好，必需提高播种技术，改进播种方法，以发挥种籽的最大利用效率，节省出大量的种籽来保证秋菜播种面积的扩大。
    我们认为，节约用种并不是单纯是减少播种量的问题，而主要是提高播种质量和栽培技术。菜地整得平而细，不会由于土面不平造成积水或形成空隙；播种时使用毒谷、毒饵防治地下害虫，并加强苗期防虫工作；施用的饼肥、粪肥先经发酵然后才使用；种籽播得很均匀，播后作好复土镇压工作；播种时的土壤的温度适当等等，都是提高播种质量，保证全苗的重要措施。此外，直播的白菜、萝卜和芥菜等，也都可以大力推广“戳垵法”播种，每垵中播种粒数还可以适当的减少，万一缺苗，还可以采用移苗补栽的办法。过去认为萝卜是不能移栽的，缺苗后只能补种，而补种又有植株大小不匀的缺点。但据我所试验结果，萝卜幼苗在二至四片真叶时，多带些土移苗补栽，同样可以生长良好。
    采用育苗移栽法播种的白菜，可以改撒播为条播，并可播稀一些。这样不仅可以节省出许多种籽，而且能使幼苗有适宜的营养面积而生长茁壮，同时也便于移栽时多带一些土，以减少伤根。育苗移栽可以及时而方便地作好幼苗的虫害防治工作，而且可以在高温时采用苇帘遮阴，以减少毒病的发生。
    胡萝卜也是重要的秋菜之一。有些地区种胡萝卜习惯采用撒播法，如果改用条播，就可以节省用种量二分之一以上。
    总之，只要我们从各方面努力改进播种方法，提高播种质量，不仅可以节省出大量的种籽来扩大栽培面积，同时还可以促进幼苗生长健壮、减少间苗所用的劳力。
