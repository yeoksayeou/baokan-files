Xinhua News Agency, 30th - The First Ministry of Machine Building and the National Committee of the First Machinery Trade Union have jointly formed two work groups that have recently visited key cities in East China, Central South China, and Northwest China to understand and collect advanced experiences in improving the quality and output of castings and forgings, saving raw materials, and improving workshop management and order. This aims to promote the in-depth development of the national casting and forging quality and high-yield competition and to prepare for the competition evaluation to be held in August.

Casting and forging are prominent weak links in the current increase in production in the machinery industry, and also a key area for practicing thrift. Since the beginning of the year, the Party committees, trade unions, and machinery industry departments of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have attached great importance to mobilizing the masses to carry out competitions and explore the potential of casting and forging. On the basis of carrying out inter-factory competitions in the regions, the First Ministry of Machine Building and the National Committee of the First Machinery Trade Union, together with the four industrial ministries of Metallurgy, Railways, Chemical Industry, and Textile Industry, organized a national inter-factory competition for high-quality and high-yield casting and forging in April this year. So far, relevant factories in twenty-one provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have participated in this competition, which has played a significant role in increasing the output and quality of castings and forgings.

Timely exchange of advanced experience is the main method for the competition to achieve certain results. Since February this year, the First Ministry of Machine Building and the National Committee of the First Machinery Trade Union have successively held four meetings in Wuxi, Shanghai, Lushun and Dalian, etc. In addition to evaluating the competition in the first quarter, they focused on exchanging advanced experiences of universal significance in clay mold casting, chemical hardening of molding sand, utilization of local iron and local coke, hydraulic sand cleaning, and die forging, as well as the experience of strengthening technical management in casting workshops, which were well received by various factories. For example, before February this year, only a few enterprises used clay mold casting; now, according to incomplete statistics, ten provinces and cities have promoted this experience, which has improved the output and quality of castings and forgings, and saved raw materials. According to the preliminary statistics of fifteen factories in Chengdu, after the promotion of these experiences, the average qualification rate of castings was 77.49% in April, increased to 80.9% in May, and further increased to 82.91% in June. After the Sichuan Provincial Machinery System exchanged the experience of local iron desulfurization of the Chongqing Wangjiang Machine Factory and the experience of the Minsheng Shipyard in strengthening casting technical management in early June, the mechanical system of the entire province launched a campaign to "learn desulfurization from Wangjiang and modeling from shipbuilding." In terms of forging, the Dalian Crane Factory has vigorously promoted die forging this year, and the utilization coefficient of die molds has now reached 78%. The Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory has promoted die forging for five products including bridge seats, and the finished product rate has increased by about 15%.

    一机部和第一机械工会共同组成工作组
    收集经验促进铸锻件优质高产
    新华社30日讯　第一机械工业部和中国第一机械工会全国委员会共同组成的两个工作组，最近分别到华东、中南、西北等地重点城市，了解和收集有关提高铸锻件质量和产量，节约原料和材料，改进车间管理秩序等方面的先进经验，促进全国铸锻优质高产竞赛深入开展，并且为即将在8月间举行的竞赛评比作准备。
    铸造和锻造是当前机械工业增加生产中突出的薄弱环节，也是厉行节约的一个重点。年初以来，各省、市、自治区的党委、工会和机械工业部门都十分重视发动群众开展竞赛，发掘铸锻的潜在力量。在地区开展厂际竞赛的基础上，第一机械工业部和中国第一机械工会全国委员会今年4月曾会同冶金、铁道、化工、纺织等四个工业部，组织了全国铸锻优质高产厂际竞赛。到目前为止，全国已有二十一个省、市、自治区的有关工厂参加了这一竞赛，对提高铸锻件产量和质量起了不少推动作用。
    及时交流先进经验是使竞赛获得一定成效的主要方法。第一机械工业部和中国第一机械工会全国委员会从今年2月以来，先后在无锡、上海、旅大等地召开了四次会议，除对第一季度的竞赛作了评比外，着重地交流了泥型铸造，型砂化学硬化，土铁土焦利用，水力清砂，胎模锻造等带有普遍意义的先进经验，以及铸造车间加强技术管理的经验，深受各厂欢迎。例如今年2月以前，只有少数企业采用泥型铸造；现在，据不完全的统计，已有十个省、市推广了这个经验，提高了铸锻件的产量与质量，节约了原料和材料。据成都市十五个厂的初步统计，推广这些经验以后，铸件合格率4月份平均为77.49％，5月份上升为80.9％，6月份又提高到82.91％。四川省机械系统6月初交流了重庆望江机器厂土铁脱硫的经验与民生修造船厂加强铸造技术管理的经验以后，全省机械系统普遍掀起了“脱硫学望江，造型赶船舶”运动。在锻造方面，大连起重机厂今年大力推广胎模锻造以后，现在胎模利用系数已达78％。太原机车车辆厂有桥梁座等五种产品推广了胎模锻造，成品率提高15％左右。
