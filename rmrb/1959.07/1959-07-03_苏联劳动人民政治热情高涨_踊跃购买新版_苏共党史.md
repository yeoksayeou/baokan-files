Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 2nd: The new edition of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" textbook is now on sale in bookstores in Moscow and the Moscow region, and the broad masses of working people are enthusiastically purchasing it.

In the new bookstore on Gorky Street in Moscow, a special counter has been set up to sell the History of the CPSU. Since it opened at 11:00 a.m., many workers, staff, students, and soldiers have been continuously lining up to buy it. According to a responsible comrade from the Moscow Book Sales Management Office, the new edition of the History of the CPSU has been well-received by readers since it went on sale in Moscow on June 27th. He said that the first edition of the History of the CPSU was only printed in 250,000 copies, and most of them were distributed to Party, government, scientific, and educational institutions in various regions. Therefore, the first batch of the new edition of the History of the CPSU sold out quickly in bookstores.

Recently, the second printing of 750,000 copies of the new edition of the History of the CPSU has begun to be sold in Moscow.

The publication of the new edition of the History of the CPSU is a major event in the political life of the Soviet people. The long-awaited readers all want to further arm themselves with Marxist-Leninist theory through studying this textbook. Recently, Moscow newspapers have successively published introductions to the new edition of the History of the CPSU and articles by readers.

    苏联劳动人民政治热情高涨
    踊跃购买新版“苏共党史”
    新华社莫斯科2日电　新版“苏联共产党党史”教科书已在莫斯科市和莫斯科州各书店出售，广大劳动人民踊跃购买。
    在莫斯科高尔基大街新开设的大书店里专门设立了出售苏共党史的柜台，从上午十一点开业后，许多工人、职员、学生和军人络绎不绝地前往排队购买。据莫斯科书籍出售管理处负责同志对本社记者说，新版党史自6月27日在莫斯科开始出售后，就受到了广大读者的欢迎。他说党史初版仅印了二十五万册，而且大部分是分发给各地党、政、科学、教育等机关的，因此书店出售的第一批新版党史在很短时间内就争购一空。
    最近在莫斯科已开始出售第二次印刷的七十五万册新版党史。
    新版苏共党史的出版是苏联人民政治生活中的一件大事。等待已久的广大读者都想从这本教科书的学习中，进一步用马克思列宁主义理论来武装自己。近日来莫斯科各报纸先后刊登了新版苏共党史介绍和读者的文章。
