    Good Ways to Tap Potential

    The light industrial factories in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, used the method of "finding gaps" and fully tapped potential in the first half of the year to increase the production of daily necessities by more than 17 million yuan. This experience deserves attention.

    In every enterprise, there are always three states of people: advanced, intermediate, and backward. By comparing the production of these three types of people, we can discover the banners in terms of operational technology, equipment utilization, and raw material consumption, and we can find some successful experiences. These banners can be used as goals for all employees to strive for; these experiences can be used as a reference for all employees to improve their technical level. By widely promoting these experiences, so that people in intermediate and backward states can reach the level of current advanced producers, the output and quality of the entire enterprise can be greatly improved.

    Any enterprise will have production potential at any time. However, this potential is sometimes not immediately apparent. How to discover it and tap it? An effective way is to organize a comparison between advanced and backward, to organize the backward to catch up with the advanced, and the advanced to continue to move forward. The valuable thing about the "finding gaps" approach of the Wuhu City Light Industry Department lies here.

    挖潜力的好办法
    安徽省芜湖市各轻工业工厂用“找差距”的办法，在上半年充分挖掘潜力增产了一千七百多万元的日用品。这一经验值得重视。
    在各个企业中，总有先进、中间和落后三种状态的人。通过对这三种人的生产情况的对比，就能发现在操作技术、设备利用、原材料消耗等方面的旗帜，并且能摸出一些成功的经验。这些旗帜，可以作为全体职工努力的目标；这些经验，可以作为全体职工提高技术水平的借鉴。把这些经验推而广之，使中间、落后状态的人都能达到现在先进生产者的水平，整个企业的产量和质量就能大大提高。
    任何企业、任何时候都会有生产潜力。但是，这种潜力有时候不是一眼就能看到的。怎样发现它，把它挖掘出来呢？一个有效的办法就是：组织先进与落后的对比，组织落后者赶先进，先进者继续前进。芜湖市轻工业部门“找差距”的可贵之处，就在这里。
