Fully Exploiting the Potential of Locomotives to Save Coal
Commentator of this newspaper

Railway enterprises are among the largest coal consumers, and locomotive coal consumption accounts for more than 80% of the total railway coal consumption. Under the premise of ensuring the safety, punctuality, and high output of railway transportation, vigorously saving locomotive coal has significant implications for economic construction.

In recent years, railway departments have done a lot of work in saving locomotive coal, and the annual locomotive coal consumption has been lower than the national target. Since last year, with the great development of industrial and agricultural production, the national railway transportation volume has increased sharply, and railway departments have added a batch of locomotives and new drivers; especially this year, a batch of "Friendly" type locomotives that had not been used in the past were added, and some drivers have not fully mastered the operation and firing techniques of this type of locomotive. This has put forward new requirements for the work of saving locomotive coal. Based on this year's situation and past experience, what work should be done to save a large amount of locomotive coal?

To unleash the potential of locomotives to save coal, the first step is to master locomotive operation and firing techniques as soon as possible. Mastering any technology always takes time, but this process can be shortened. The Zhengzhou North Locomotive Depot's "Friendly" Type No. 1446 locomotive youth crew of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau started using "Friendly" type locomotives in early April this year. Due to their hard work, they became familiar with the locomotive's performance in a short period and explored a set of "Friendly" type locomotive operation and firing methods. In late April, they operated according to this set of methods, which not only reversed the situation of high coal consumption but also saved coal on every trip. From May to July 15, under safe and punctual conditions, they saved more than 157,000 kilograms of coal, and their coal consumption was more than 20% lower than that of some crews in the Zhengzhou North Locomotive Depot. The Ministry of Railways is organizing the promotion of this crew's operating experience; their spirit of not fearing difficulties and actively studying technology is also worthy of emulation by other crews.

To save coal on locomotives, maintenance and repair work must be done well to keep the locomotives in good thermal condition. Locomotives in good thermal condition can evaporate more than 12 tons of water per ton of standard coal, while locomotives in poor thermal condition may not even evaporate 10 tons of water. The Ministry of Railways requires that the hourly water consumption of "Friendly" type locomotives be reduced to below 500 kilograms, but some locomotives consume as much as one to two tons due to steam leakage, which increases the locomotive's coal consumption. The locomotive departments of railway bureaus in various regions should quickly repair those locomotives with poor thermal condition, eliminate and prevent the phenomenon of heat loss from locomotives, so as to maximize the use of coal's thermal energy. Strengthening repairs is an important measure; however, it is more important to do a good job in daily maintenance to keep the locomotives in good quality. In addition, improving ventilation devices to increase boiler evaporation rate; keeping the boiler's air pressure and water level at the specified standards to ensure that the steam exerts maximum efficiency; drivers and stokers understanding the water quality and correctly measuring water and administering medicine when going on and off duty, doing a good job of frequent and small water drainage to prevent scale growth, improve steam quality, and increase locomotive traction are also important factors in saving coal.

Locomotive coal saving is not only a matter for the locomotive itself, but also related to the organization and management of the entire railway transportation. If the transportation organization work is not done well, resulting in many unreasonable single locomotive runs, a lot of coal will be wasted. Before the train enters the station, if the signal is not dropped when it should be, causing the train to stop outside the station, each stop will waste about 150 kilograms of coal. In terms of shunting, if the dispatching is appropriate, shortening the shunting operation time by one hour can save 150 to 200 kilograms of coal. All relevant departments should strengthen the concept of collaboration, strive to overcome shortcomings in their work, strengthen planning in their work, improve work efficiency, and jointly ensure the saving of locomotive coal.

In order to further tap the potential of locomotives to save coal, railway departments in various regions should continue to deepen the red flag train competition movement with the goal of fully implementing the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Organizing trains to run at super-axle and high speed to achieve high output is an important aspect of exploiting the potential of locomotives to save coal. For every 1% increase in locomotive traction weight, fuel consumption can be reduced by 0.4%. Locomotive coal saving must also be carried out under safe and punctual conditions; otherwise, it will cause greater waste. Deeply mobilizing the masses and fully implementing the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results will enable the railway department to both complete its transportation tasks and save a large amount of coal.

    充分挖掘机车省煤的潜力
    本报评论员
    铁路企业是用煤最多的部门之一，而机车用煤又占整个铁路用煤量的80％以上。在保证铁路运输安全、正点、高产的条件下，大力节约机车用煤，对于经济建设有重要意义。
    几年来，铁路部门在节约机车用煤方面作了许多工作，每年机车用煤量都比国家规定的指标有所降低。去年以来，工农业生产大发展，全国铁路运量剧增，铁路部门增添了一批机车和开车新手；特别是今年增添了一批过去没有使用过的“友好”型机车，这种机车的操纵和焚火技术有些开车人员还没有完全掌握。这就给节约机车用煤的工作提出了新的要求。根据今年的情况和历年的经验，做好哪些工作才能大量节约机车用煤呢？
    要发挥机车节约用煤的潜力，首先要尽快地掌握机车操纵和焚火技术。掌握任何技术，总要有一个过程，但是这个过程可以缩短。郑州铁路局郑州机务北段“友好”型1446号机车青年包乘组，今年4月上旬开始使用“友好”型机车，由于刻苦钻研，用较短的时间就熟悉了机车的性能，并摸索出一套“友好”型机车操纵和焚火的作业方法。4月下旬，他们按照这套方法操作，不但扭转了煤耗高的局面，还做到趟趟节约煤。从5月到7月15日，他们在安全、正点的条件下，节约煤炭十五万七千多公斤，用煤量比郑州机务北段某些包乘组低20％以上。这个包乘组的操作经验，铁道部已在组织推广；他们不畏困难、积极钻研技术的精神，也值得其他包乘组效法。
    要机车省煤，就要做好维护和检修工作，使机车经常保持良好的热力技术状态。热力技术状态良好的机车，一吨标准煤可以蒸发十二吨以上的水，热力技术状态不好的机车，甚至还蒸发不到十吨水；铁道部要求把“友好”型机车每小时耗水量降低到五百公斤以下，有的机车由于泄漏蒸汽，耗水量竟达到一吨到二吨，这样便增加了机车的用煤量。各地铁路局的机务部门应该迅速整修那些热力技术状态不良的机车，消除和防止机车失散热力的现象，以便最大限度地利用煤炭的热能。加强检修，是一项重要的措施；但是，更重要的还是要做好日常的维护工作，使机车经常保持质量良好。此外，改善通风装置，提高锅炉蒸发率；锅炉的气压和水位经常保持规定的标准，保证蒸汽发挥最大的效能；司机、司炉在出勤、退勤的时候，了解水质、正确量水下药，做到勤放水、少放水，很好地排除泥垢，防止水垢的增长，提高蒸汽质量，增加机车牵引力等，都是节约用煤的重要因素。
    机车节约用煤，不仅是机车本身的事，而且和整个铁路运输的组织管理工作有关。如果运输组织工作做得不好，造成很多不合理的单机走行，就会浪费很多煤炭。列车进站前，信号该落未落，造成站外停车，每一次就要浪费一百五十公斤左右的煤。在调车方面，如果调度得当，调车作业时间每缩短一小时，就能节约煤炭一百五十到二百公斤。各个有关部门应该加强协作观念，努力克服工作中的缺点，加强工作中的计划性，提高工作效率，共同保证节约机车用煤。
    为了进一步挖掘机车节约用煤的潜力，各地铁路部门要继续深入开展以全面贯彻多快好省方针为目标的红旗列车竞赛运动。组织列车超轴快速运转，实现高产，是发挥机车节约用煤潜力的一个重要方面。机车牵引重量每增加1％，燃料消耗就能减少0.4％。机车节约用煤，还必须在安全、正点的条件下进行；不然将会造成更大的浪费。深入发动群众，全面地贯彻多快好省的方针，将会使铁路部门既能完成运输任务，又能节约大量煤炭。
