The Shuangxi Brigade Party Branch of Shinan Commune in Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, correctly implements the mass line, consults with the masses on everything, is resourceful and decisive, strives for initiative, and promotes the progress of agricultural production.

The Shuangxi Brigade is located in a semi-hilly, semi-plain area. The entire brigade has 236 households, 1,106 people, and 1,510 mu of cultivated land. The production conditions of this brigade are not very good. Only one-third of the cultivated land has relatively good sandy soil, and the water conservancy conditions are also poor, often suffering from floods and droughts in the past. As a result, the lives of the masses were very poor, and more than 100 households were beggars before liberation. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party branch, agricultural production has made tremendous progress. In 1954, the average grain yield of this brigade was only 480 jin per mu. In 1955, it increased to 670 jin, in 1957 to 1,032 jin, and in 1958 it skyrocketed to 1,729 jin. The income of the commune members also gradually increased. Since then, this brigade has begun to change its impoverished face and gradually become prosperous. The commune members sang praises: "Two rivers in Shuangxi, many disasters in the past, since the Communist Party came, many happy days!"

The Shuangxi Brigade Branch has consistently adhered to the mass line leadership method in leading production. Zhang Yulin, the branch secretary, often educates Party members and cadres, saying: "Production is everyone's business, and we cannot rely solely on a few cadres to come up with ideas. If we mobilize commune members to come up with ideas together, things will be easy to handle." The branch believes that the power and wisdom of the masses are always endless. As long as we truly rely on the masses, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. They consult with the masses on everything in their work, and when problems arise or difficulties are encountered, they study ways to overcome them with the masses. Last year, during early rice seedling cultivation, more than 60 mu of the brigade's 80 mu of seedling fields developed cotton rot disease due to the invasion of cold air, causing seedling rot. In order to save the seedlings, the branch held three meetings in a row, but no one could think of a solution. Later, branch secretary Zhang Yulin went to ask the old farmer Wang Kongcai for advice. Wang Kongcai said that cotton rot disease in seedlings can be cured by spraying with slaked gypsum water. The branch immediately experimented with two mu of land, and the effect was very good. The rice all sprouted and grew leaves in two or three days. After the experiment was successful, the brigade immediately held an on-site meeting and promoted it throughout the brigade, resulting in the rescue of more than 60 mu of seedlings in the entire brigade.

Because the Shuangxi Brigade Branch consults with the masses on everything and often studies and grasps the development trend of work, many tasks are prepared and arranged in advance, so that both leaders and the masses can have a clear understanding. Therefore, they often fight proactive battles. For example, the branch considered the possible problems in this year's agricultural production as early as last year. The branch analyzed that there would inevitably be a greater leap forward this year, and to ensure a greater leap forward this year, one of the important key issues is to have more fertilizer. To have more fertilizer, we must open up more fertilizer sources. Therefore, the branch decided to start grasping fertilizer early this year and proposed that this year's fertilizer should be doubled compared with last year. The branch made arrangements for this issue very early and took various measures: (1) Plant green manure extensively. The area of green manure increased from more than 300 mu last year to more than 600 mu, and field management of green manure was strengthened, so that the yield of green manure increased from 5,000 jin per mu to 10,000 jin; (2) Go up the mountains to cut weeds. More than 200 pieces of grass cutting tools were purchased in advance, and they went up the mountains to cut grass as soon as the Spring Festival was over, cutting more than 700,000 jin of weeds in 20 days; (3) Vigorously carry out composting in the fields. The area of composting in the entire brigade reached more than 100 mu. Because of early grasping and many methods, although this year's fertilizer accumulation task is greater than last year and fertilizer sources are more difficult, the task was still successfully completed, and the accumulated fertilizer was more than doubled compared with last year, and the quality of the fertilizer was very high. The early grasping of fertilizer accumulation led to the early delivery of fertilizer, and then plowing, seedling cultivation and other series of farm work also followed suit. In this way, one step of initiative led to step-by-step initiative.

In order to adapt to the new situation and new requirements of the great leap forward in agricultural production, the Shuangxi Brigade Branch often studies with the commune members various new methods to promote production. At the end of March and the beginning of April this year, there was a fierce debate about whether to plow green manure fields early or late. The Shuangxi Brigade planted more than 600 mu of green manure this year. When is the most appropriate time to plow these green manure fields? This is a very important issue. Some people advocated following the old rules and waiting for the red clover to form pods before plowing the fields. They believed that late plowing had a greater and more lasting fertilizer effect. Some people advocated early plowing, plowing the fields as soon as the red clover flowers were in full bloom, so that the fertilizer effect would be faster and suitable for planting early rice. The branch carefully analyzed everyone's opinions and believed that although late plowing of green manure had a greater fertilizer effect, it took effect later. However, this year's situation is different from the past. First, in the past, the main crop was single-season mid-season rice, which had a long growth period and slow growth. Fertilizer needed to have lasting power. This year, 80% of the paddy fields are double-season early rice, which has a short growth period and early growth, requiring quick-acting fertilizer. The faster the fertilizer effect, the better. Second, this year the area of green manure fields is large, and late plowing will put a strain on livestock and labor. Third, the past rice transplanting period was late, generally from Grain Full to Grain in Ear. This year, it is required to transplant the seedlings well around Grain Rain to Beginning of Summer. Late plowing will not catch up with the season. Based on these three points, the branch decided to break with convention and plow the green manure half a month earlier than in previous years. Because of early plowing, the green manure rotted quickly, ensuring timely field preparation and timely transplanting, and staggering farm work, which solved the contradiction of insufficient livestock and labor. As a result, the task of transplanting early rice was completed seven days earlier than last year. Now, the early rice is growing very vigorously because it gets fertilizer early.

In addition, the Shuangxi Brigade Branch also cares for the lives of the commune members in every possible way and gives full play to the exemplary role of Party members, leading the masses to advance together. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses is soaring, and under the leadership of the Party branch, they are striving to achieve a greater leap forward in production this year.

    多谋善断　事事主动
    双溪大队党支部正确贯彻群众路线
    据安徽日报消息　桐城县石南公社双溪大队党支部，正确贯彻群众路线，遇事与群众商量，多谋善断，争取了主动，促进了农业生产的前进。
    双溪大队处于半丘陵、半平畈地区，全大队共有二百三十六户，一千一百零六人，一千五百一十亩耕地。这个大队的生产条件并不是很好的，耕地的土质只有三分之一是较好的夹砂土，水利条件也不好，过去时常闹水旱灾害。因此，群众生活十分贫困，解放前要饭的就有一百多户。解放后，在党支部的领导下，农业生产有了巨大的发展。在1954年，这个大队的粮食产量平均每亩只有四百八十斤，1955年增加到六百七十斤，1957年增加到一千零三十二斤，到1958年又激增到一千七百二十九斤。社员的收入也逐步上升。从此，这个大队开始改变了贫困的面貌，日渐走向富裕。社员们歌颂道：“双溪两条河，过去灾害多，自从来了共产党，幸福的日子多！”
    双溪大队支部在领导生产中一贯坚持群众路线的领导方法，支部书记张玉林经常教育党员和干部说：“生产是大家的事，不能仅仅依靠几个干部想办法，如果发动社员大家共同想办法，事情就容易办了。”支部认为，群众的力量和智慧，永远是无穷无尽的，只要真正依靠群众，就没有克服不了的困难。他们在工作中遇事和群众商量，工作中发生问题遇到困难的时候，便和群众研究克服困难的办法。去年早稻育秧，由于寒流的侵袭，全队八十多亩秧田有六十多亩生了棉腐病，发生烂秧现象。为了挽救秧苗，支部一连开了三次会议，可是大家都想不出办法，后来支书张玉林，去请教老农汪孔才。汪孔才说，秧苗发生棉腐病，用熟石膏水喷洒可能治好。支部立即用两亩田试验，效果果然很好，两三天稻子全部发芽生叶了。试验成功以后，大队立即召开现场会议，在全队推广，结果挽救了全队六十多亩秧苗。
    双溪大队支部由于事事和群众商量，经常研究并掌握工作发展趋势，很多工作都提早作好准备和安排，从领导到群众都能做到心中有数。因此，经常打主动仗。例如，支部早在去年就考虑到今年的农业生产可能发生的问题。支部分析，今年将必然有一个更大的跃进，而要保证今年更大的跃进，重要的关键问题之一就是要有更多的肥料。要有更多的肥料就要开辟更多的肥源。因此，支部决定今年提早抓肥料，并提出今年的肥料要比去年增加一倍。对这个问题支部很早就作了安排，并采取了各种措施：（1）大种绿肥。绿肥的面积由去年的三百多亩增加到六百多亩，并且加强绿肥的田间管理，使绿肥的产量由每亩五千斤增加到一万斤；（2）上山砍荒草。提早购买了二百多件砍草工具，春节一过，就上山砍，二十天共砍荒草七十多万斤；（3）就田大搞沤肥。全大队沤肥的面积达一百多亩。由于抓得早，办法多，今年的积肥任务虽比去年更大，肥源更加困难，但是仍然顺利完成了任务，积的肥料比去年增加一倍以上，而且肥料质量很高。积肥抓得早，送肥也就跟着提早了，于是犁田、育秧等一系列农活又跟着提早了。这样一步主动就步步争取了主动。
    为了适应农业生产大跃进的新形势和新要求，双溪大队支部经常和社员们共同研究如何推动生产前进的各种新办法。今年3月底4月初，关于绿肥田早犁还是迟犁的问题就发生过激烈的争论。双溪大队今年共种了六百多亩绿肥，这些绿肥田什么时候翻犁最适当？这是个很重要的问题。有些人主张按老规矩办事，要等红花草结荚子才犁田。他们认为，迟犁肥效大，有后力。有些人主张早犁，红花草的花开齐了就犁田，这样肥效快，适宜插早稻。支部认真分析了大家的意见，认为迟犁绿肥虽然肥效大，但是得力迟，而今年情况和过去不同。第一，过去主要是一季中稻，生长期长，发棵迟，肥料需要后力，今年80％的水田是双季早稻，生长期短，发棵早，需要速效肥料，肥效越快越好；第二，今年绿肥田面积大，犁迟了畜力和劳力忙不开；第三，过去插秧期迟，一般是小满到芒种插秧，今年要求谷雨到立夏前后就要插好秧，迟犁季节赶不上。根据这三点，支部决定打破常规比往年提早半个月犁了绿肥。由于犁得早，绿肥很快腐烂，保证了及时做田，及时插秧，并且错开农活，解决了畜力、劳力不足的矛盾。结果，早稻比去年提前七天完成了插秧任务。现在，早稻因为得肥力早，生长都很旺盛。
    此外，双溪大队支部还无微不至地关心社员生活和发挥党员的模范作用，带动群众一起前进。所以，群众的干劲冲天，在党支部领导下，正在争取今年生产获得更大的跃进。
