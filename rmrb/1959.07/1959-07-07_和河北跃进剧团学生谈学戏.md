    Talking about Learning Opera with Students from the Hebei Yuejin Opera Troupe
    Mei Lanfang
    Last time I watched three of your performances: "Du Shiniang," "San Cha Kou," and "Mu Guiying Takes Command." They were all performed well, which shows that your acting skills have laid a certain foundation. It also shows that your teachers must have put in a lot of effort. As long as you follow this correct path step by step, you will surely succeed.
    You asked me about the "Mu Guiying Takes Command," how to run the stage circle with feet not showing, and it looks good. What's the trick? Actually, there is no trick. It's just because of the basic waist and leg skills from childhood. The faster the circle is run, the more broken and even the steps should be. If the steps are sometimes large and sometimes small, the feet will show, and it will not be beautiful. You also asked me how the throwing of water sleeves is so accurate? I can only answer this: probably because I have performed the opera many times, and I am familiar with it. Practice makes perfect, and it is easy to find a more accurate and suitable action. The art of opera has its own set of performance programs and rules. We must first master these programs and rules, and then use them flexibly in combination with the emotions of the characters in the play. Sometimes you can throw the sleeves this way, and sometimes you can throw the sleeves that way; sometimes you can strike a pose this way, and sometimes you can strike a pose that way. In other words, you are allowed to move freely within a certain range. The most important thing is to be closely integrated with the play. When I went to the Soviet Union to perform in 1935, Mr. Stanislavski watched the opera and said that Chinese opera performance is "free movement with rules." This sentence is very reasonable. However, if you want to find the most accurate and appropriate action at once when performing a newly arranged play, it is not an easy task. In "Mu Guiying Takes Command," you praised me for the good use of water sleeves. In fact, I am constantly exploring. I do this today, and then change it tomorrow to try. Some places I am not satisfied with myself, and I am still "looking" for them.
    The achievement of an actor depends entirely on the solid basic skills learned in childhood. First, learn from traditional excellent programs, because these traditional good plays have been carefully created and processed by many predecessors, and they can all lay a good foundation for young actors in terms of performing skills. Also, in the early years of learning opera, although you should learn everything, the so-called more is better, but don't learn too many "roles" at the beginning; if you learn too much, you are afraid that you will not be able to go deep into each one and become more but not refined. When the foundation is solid, then develop into an "all-rounder," that will be useful. As for which play someone should learn first, it should be based on the different conditions of each person to make an appropriate choice. This is the responsibility of the teachers. They have rich experience and will arrange it well for you.
    I have loved watching opera since I was a child, and I am still very interested in watching opera. Therefore, I often introduce the benefits of watching more opera to young actors, hoping that they will watch operas of all roles and all kinds of dramas. Of course, watching well-performed operas can enrich their own performances. Don't be disappointed when you see badly performed operas. There is a contrast between good and bad, and you will know that others have gone the wrong way, and you can avoid making the same mistakes. To be an actor, you must be good at absorbing the strengths of others and avoiding the weaknesses of others, so as to continuously improve your acting skills.
    Hebei Bangzi, this kind of opera, has a very rich artistic deposit. Many things in Beijing opera are absorbed from Bangzi. Taking Mr. Yu Lianquan's performance as an example, he absorbed a lot of Bangzi's traditional art and became one of the main schools of Beijing opera Hua Dan. At present, there is a trend in the opera circle: the dialogue and锣鼓点(percussion patterns) are learning from Beijing opera, and the makeup is learning from Yue opera. It is right to absorb the good things from brother operas, but if you lose your own characteristics and destroy your own style because of this, it is also worth considering. I think Hebei Bangzi should still use its own traditional dialogue and the original鑼鼓点(percussion patterns). This is in line with the spirit of "Let a hundred flowers bloom." In the past, when Hebei Bangzi and Beijing opera performed on the same stage, the audience could clearly see the differences between the two kinds of operas. For example, Bangzi's singing is relatively high-pitched, the movements are more exaggerated, and the tone of the dialogue is obviously different from Beijing opera; and these two different kinds of operas are equally loved by the audience. Today, what I advocate is the artistic exchange between brother operas, and what I oppose is the uncritical imitation without digestion. The above is about performance. Also, transplanting the scripts of brother operas should also be changed according to the characteristics and style of this opera. Some changes are not necessarily for the sake of good or bad, but for the style of each opera. The "Mu Guiying Takes Command" that I recently performed was transplanted from Henan opera. In the last scene of Henan opera, Mu Guiying has dozens of lines of singing, and the audience enjoys listening to it, but it cannot be arranged like this in Beijing opera. Therefore, I only sang eight lines of Yuanban. This is not because I am old and afraid of singing too much. Even if other young actors come to perform, it is impossible to sing dozens of lines. This is the relationship of different styles.
    Due to physiological changes, young actors must go through a "voice change" stage. This is known to everyone. The "voice change" time varies in length because of the different physiques of each person. During the "voice change" period, some advocate singing more, saying that the more you sing, the faster the voice will come out; some advocate that it is not suitable to sing more, and you should rest, and be extra careful with diet and warmth, so that the vocal cords can gradually recover naturally. I think the former view is unscientific, and I agree with the latter method.
    The student's vocalization, in the initial stage, the pitch should not be too high, and gradually increase. This is beneficial to the vocal cords. If the voice cannot go up, and you have to force it up, the students learning old male roles will be forced into a hoarse voice. Also, excessive practice of martial arts will make the voice "horizontal." Except for some basic skills that everyone must practice, such as "handstand," "somersault," etc., these are all specialized courses for martial arts students whose main focus is martial arts; the old male roles and 青衣(female roles) whose main focus is singing can not practice them. I am already over sixty years old this year, and I can still maintain this voice. There are probably two reasons: First, I did not over-practice my skills in my early years; second, I have always used my voice to develop along with my own vocal cords, and I do not go against it. If I sing hoarsely, I will wait until I recover before singing again; I also know how to protect my voice at ordinary times, especially after performing, I don't eat cold things and don't let my neck blow in the wind. I have always paid attention to these two points and have not dared to ignore them. I have seen some middle-aged actors in local operas who have good body skills and facial expressions, but their voices are "broken." This may be because they had to travel to different places in the past, and there were too many performances. The actors were tired from singing, and they could not get rest, but had to continue singing, so it was not easy to recover to their original state; it may also be that certain singing methods are not very healthy for the vocal cords. In order to reach high pitches, the falsetto is forced too hard, and the vocal cords are subjected to excessive and strong stimulation. The above are just my personal views, and they may not be entirely correct.
    Regarding the study of Dan (female role) makeup, because of the different face shapes of each person, it is best to ask others to introduce their experience, and then use patches, apply foundation, draw eyes, and draw eyebrows according to your own face shape... The size of the stage and the distance of the audience are closely related to our makeup. When performing in a large theater, the audience is far away from the stage, so the eyebrows and eyes should be drawn heavier. If they are drawn lightly, they will not be seen clearly from a distance. On the contrary, when performing in a small theater, the audience is sitting very close, so the eyebrows and eyes should not be drawn too heavily, and they must be drawn lightly to make the face look delicate. The intensity of the stage lighting is also closely related to the makeup. If the light is strong, the eyebrows and eyes should be drawn thicker, and the rouge should be applied deeper, otherwise the distant audience will see a blurred picture. People with facial defects, such as a slightly crooked face, a slightly slanted mouth, a face that is too long or too round, or eyebrows and eyes that are too high or too low, can correct them during makeup. If the face is too fat, you can stick the patches forward. If the face is too long, you can cover the forehead with a hairnet and apply ochre to the chin, so that it will appear shorter when viewed from a distance. The neck should not be applied too white, as applying it too white will make the face look longer. If the eyes are small, there are ways to draw them larger. People with a flat brow and nose should apply more white powder.
    The above are just some fragmented opinions for your reference only.
    Finally, I hope that you will listen more to the Party, listen more to the teachers, and ask the old artists for advice. Ask them to teach what they can teach, and ask them to talk about their performance experience even if they can't teach it. Pay attention to your health and protect your voice. You will definitely have many more opportunities to come to Beijing in the future. I think when I see your performances again, you will definitely have made more progress!

    和河北跃进剧团学生谈学戏
    梅兰芳
    上次我看了你们三出戏：“杜十娘”、“三岔口”和“穆桂英挂帅”，都演得不错，可见你们的演技已经打下了一定的基础，同时也说明你们的老师们一定费了不少的心血。你们只要按照这条正确的道路一步步地向前走，是不会不成功的。
    你们问我在“穆桂英挂帅”里，跑圆场时脚不外露，很好看，有什么窍门？其实这没有什么窍门，只是由于幼年的腰腿功夫，圆场跑得越快，步法越要碎而匀称，如果跑的步法忽大忽小，就会露出脚来，也就不美观了。你们还问我投水袖怎么那样准确？我只能这样回答：大概是戏演得多了，演得熟了，熟能生巧，就容易找到一个比较准确而合适的动作。戏曲艺术是有着它自己的一套表演程式和规律的，我们首先要掌握了这个程式和规律，配合着剧中人的情感，灵活运用，有时可以这样投袖，也可以那样投袖；有时可以这样亮相，也可以那样亮相。换句话说，在一定的范围内是允许你自由活动的，最要紧的是要跟戏紧密结合才行。我在1935年去苏联演出，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基先生看了戏，说中国的戏曲表演是“有规则的自由动作”。这句话是很有道理的。但是，如果演一个新排的戏，要一下子就找到最准确、最合适的动作，也不是一件容易的事。我在“穆桂英挂帅”里水袖的运用，你们夸我做得好看，其实，我正在不断的摸索，今天这样做，明天又换个样子试试，有些地方我自己还不满意，也正在“找”呢。
    一个演员的成就，全靠本人幼年的基本工要练得结实，首先从传统的优秀节目学起，因为这些传统的好戏，都是经过许多前辈们精心的创造和加工，都能够替青年演员在表演技术方面打下良好的基础。还有，幼年学戏时期，虽然什么戏都应该学，所谓多多益善，但一开始不要“行当”学得太多；学得太多了，就怕每样都不能深，不能透，变成多而不精。等底子打结实了，再向“多面手”发展，那才有用呢。至于某人该先学什么戏，那要根据各人不同的条件作适当的选择，这是老师们的责任，他们有丰富的经验，会给你们安排得很好的。
    我从小就爱看戏，一直到现在对于看戏还是有很大兴趣，所以我常常把多看戏的好处介绍给青年演员，希望他们什么行当的戏都看，什么剧种的戏都看，看到演得好的戏，当然能够丰富自己的表演，看了演得坏的戏，也不要感到失望。好坏有个对比，就知道别人走错了路，自己可以不再犯同样的毛病。做一个演员，就是要善于吸取别人的长处，避免别人的缺点，这样才能不断地提高自己的演技。
    河北梆子这个剧种，艺术的蕴藏是很丰富的，京戏里有很多东西是从梆子里吸收过来的。拿于连泉先生的表演来说，他就吸取了不少梆子的传统艺术而成为京剧花旦主要流派之一。目前戏曲界有一种风气：道白和锣鼓点向京戏学习，化装向越剧学习。吸取兄弟剧种的好东西，这是对的，如果因此丢掉了自己的特点，破坏了自己的风格，也是值得考虑的。我觉得河北梆子还是应该用自己传统的道白和原来的锣鼓点，这样，才符合“百花齐放”的精神。过去，河北梆子和京剧同台演出，观众能够很清楚地看出这两个剧种的不同之处，例如，梆子的唱腔比较高亢，动作比较夸张，道白的语调也显然跟京剧不一样；而这两个不同的剧种，同样为观众所喜爱。今天，我赞成的是兄弟剧种在艺术上的交流，反对的是不经过融化而生搬硬套的模仿。以上讲的是表演。还有，移植兄弟剧种的剧本，也应该根据本剧种的特点、风格加以变动。有些变动的地方，不一定是为了好坏问题，而是各剧种的风格问题。我最近演的“穆桂英挂帅”，就是从豫剧移植过来的。在豫剧的末一场里，穆桂英有几十句唱词，台下听得很痛快，可是放在京剧里，就不能这样安排了。所以，我只唱了八句元板，这并不是因为我年纪大了，怕多唱，即便是其他青年演员来演，也不可能唱几十句，这就是风格不同的关系。
    青年演员由于生理上的变化，必然要经过一个“倒仓”阶段，这是大家都知道的，“倒仓”时间有长有短，是因为各人的体质不同的原故。在“倒仓”期内，有的主张要多唱，据说，唱得越多，嗓子出来的越快；有的主张不宜多唱，应该休息，对于饮食寒暖格外小心，让声带很自然地逐步恢复过来。我认为前一种的主张是不科学的，我同意后一种办法。
    学生的吊嗓子，初期调门不宜太高，逐渐往上长，这对声带来说是有利的，如果嗓子上不去，硬要往上长，学老生的就会逼成一条左嗓子。还有，武工练过头，会把嗓子练“横”的，除了有些基本工人人都要练之外，如“拿顶”、“翻大跟斗”等等，都是以武工为主的武生、武旦的专修课目；以唱工为主的老生、青衣就可以不练。我今年已经六十多岁了，还能保持现在这点嗓子，大概是有两种原因：第一、在幼年没有把工练过头；第二、我用嗓子一贯是顺着自己的声带来发挥，不去违拗它，唱哑了，等恢复后再唱；在平时我还知道保护嗓子，尤其在演完戏以后，不吃冷的东西，不让脖子吹风，这两点我是一直注意到今天，没有敢忽视的。我看到有些地方戏的中年演员，身上功夫挺好，脸上也有戏，就是嗓子唱“劈”啦，这可能是因为过去要跑码头，演出场次过多，演员唱累了，得不到休息，还要继续唱，所以不容易恢复原状；也可能是某些唱法对声带不太健康，为了逩高调门，就把假音逼得太厉害了，声带受着过多过强的刺激的原故。以上只是我个人的看法，不一定完全正确。
    关于旦角化装的学习，由于各人的脸型不同，最好请别人介绍经验，再根据自己的脸型来贴片子、搽水粉、画眼睛、画眉毛……。台的大小和观众的距离，跟我们的化装关系都很大，在大剧场演出，观众离舞台较远，眉、眼都要画得重些，画轻了，远处就看不清楚。相反的，在小剧场里演出，观众都坐得很近，眉、眼又不能画得太重，必须画轻些，才显得面目清秀。台上灯光的强弱，也和化装很有关系。灯光强的，眉、眼要画得浓些，胭脂要搽得深些，否则远处的观众就看成模糊一片了。脸上有缺陷的人，譬如脸稍歪，嘴稍斜，面型过长过圆，眉眼过高过低，都可以在化装时把它纠正过来，脸太胖的，可以把片子往前贴，脸太长的，可以把发网盖点上额，下颏再涂点赭色，那样，远看就显得脸短。脖子不宜搽得太白，搽得太白会显得脸更长了。眼睛小的，有法子画得大些，印堂、鼻子过于平扁的人，应该多上点白粉。
    以上讲的都还是些零零碎碎的意见，只是供你们参考。
    最后，希望你们多听党的话，多听老师的话，多找老艺人领教，能教的请他们教一教，不能教的也请他们谈一谈表演经验。注意身体，保护嗓子。今后你们再来北京的机会一定很多，我想，我再看到你们的演出时，一定更有进步了！
