    Inheriting Tradition, Developing Tradition
    Zhang Menggeng, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture
    The first class of students from the Beijing Opera School have been cultivated directly by the Party for eight years. These students have not only mastered the performance skills of Beijing Opera art such as singing, recitation, acting, and acrobatics, but also have a high school or junior high school cultural level; they can not only perform dozens of wonderful Beijing Opera repertoires, but also have a certain understanding of dramatic theory and a certain ability to analyze the plays they perform; they are not only a new force in Beijing Opera art that is both civil and martial, but also cultural fighters who have grown up under the cultivation of the Party to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to serve socialist construction.
    Now, this group of new forces has completed their studies and graduated. In order to make them more specialized and refined, and to shoulder the heavier task of inheriting and developing Beijing Opera art, the Party has assigned them to work in the Mei Lanfang, Shang Xiaoyun, and Xun Huisheng troupes. This event is not only a great happy event for the Beijing Opera circle, but also a great happy event for the vast number of drama-loving audiences. With such excellent students getting such famous teachers, we firmly believe that in the near future, we will see the stage images of the young years of Mei, Shang, and Xun, the three great Beijing Opera performing artists, and we will see a greater prosperity of Beijing Opera art.
    This happy event is also a concrete embodiment of the spirit of "inheriting tradition and developing tradition." Mei, Shang, and Xun, the three Beijing Opera performing artists, are praised by the vast audience as several famous "schools" in modern Beijing Opera female roles. They not only inherited the tradition of Beijing Opera art, but also created singing, recitation, acting, and acrobatics with unique styles based on their individual conditions, and also have their own styles in makeup and costumes. They also created their own representative repertoires based on their specialties. From the development and growth of these three performing artists, the formation of artistic schools requires continuous hard work to learn and inherit tradition, and also requires hard study and creation in order to enrich tradition, improve tradition, and develop tradition, so as to have a unique personal style. Taking Mei Lanfang as an example, it is precisely on the basis of inheriting tradition that he has become an outstanding school in female roles through his continuous hard study, continuous development and creation. His performance of "Cosmic Frontier" has long been considered to have reached its peak, but in the recent performance, he has changed many places, so that it has been further improved in performance. This spirit should become a model for our opera circles. The assignment of students from the Beijing Opera School to the Mei, Shang, and Xun troupes this time has great significance for inheriting and developing tradition.
    While congratulating Mei Lanfang, Xun Huisheng, and Shang Xiaoyun on gaining outstanding students and enabling their art to have more successors, we also firmly believe that this group of graduates from the opera school will receive better growth in their political thought and artistic accomplishment under the guidance of these three Beijing Opera performing artists, so that their artistic schools will be better inherited and developed.

    继承传统，发扬传统
    北京市文化局副局长　张梦庚
    北京市戏曲学校第一期学生，在党直接培育下已经八年了。这些学生不但掌握了京剧艺术的唱、念、做、打等表演艺术技巧。而且都具备了高中或初中的文化水平；不但能演出几十出精彩的京剧剧目，而且都具备了一定的戏剧理论知识，对演出的戏都有着一定的分析能力；不但是既能文又能武的京戏艺术的新生力量，而且都是在党培育下成长起来的为工农兵服务，为社会主义建设服务的文化战士。
    这样一批新生力量，现在已经学习期满毕业了。为着使他们更专更精，担负起继承与发扬京剧艺术的更重的任务，党把他们分配到梅兰芳、尚小云、荀慧生三个剧团去工作。这件事，不但是京剧界的大喜事，也是广大爱好戏剧观众的一件大喜事。这样优秀的学生得到这样的名师，我们坚信，在不久的将来，会使我们看到梅、尚、荀三大京剧名表演家青年时代的舞台形象，会使我们看到京剧艺术更大的繁荣。
    这件大喜事，也是“继承传统，发扬传统”精神的具体体现。梅、尚、荀三位京剧表演艺术家，被广大观众誉为现代京剧旦角中的几个著名“流派”。他们不但继承了京剧艺术的传统，而且又都是在传统的基础上，根据个人的条件，创造了具有独特风格的唱、念、做、打，并且在化装、服装上也都有各自的风格。他们并且根据自己的特长，创作出各自的代表性的剧目。从这三位表演艺术家的发展、成长来看，艺术流派的形成，是要不间断地刻苦地学习传统，继承传统，并且要努力钻研与创作，才能丰富传统，提高传统，发扬传统，从而具有个人的独特风格。以梅兰芳为例，他正是在继承传统的基础上，经过自己不间断地刻苦钻研，不间断地发展和创造，才能成为旦角中一种杰出的流派。他演的“宇宙锋”，早已被人们认为达到了高峰，但在最近演出时，他又改了很多地方，使它在表演上得到了进一步提高。这种精神应该成为我们戏曲界的典范。这次北京市戏曲学校的学生被分配到梅、尚、荀剧团去，是有着继承传统与发扬传统的重大意义的。
    我们在祝贺梅兰芳、荀慧生、尚小云获得得意门生、使自己的艺术得到更多的后继人的同时，我们也深信，戏曲学校这批毕业学生，将在这三位京剧表演艺术家的教导下，在政治思想上，在艺术修养上都将得到更好的成长，使他们的艺术流派，得到更好的继承和发扬。
