The new responsibilities of Teachers
Zu Nian

A teacher who wants to teach books well cannot simply impart book knowledge to students, but must also closely link book knowledge with production practice in the teaching process. In this way, students can not only understand book knowledge literally, but also truly understand the principles in book knowledge through production practice, and apply and develop them in practice. This is the teacher's responsibility to teach books well. The teachers of Harbin No. 18 Middle School and No. 10 Middle School have truly shouldered this glorious responsibility of teachers in their teaching, and thus the quality of teaching has been continuously improved, and the number of students who have achieved excellent results has increased.

In the past, teachers only taught book knowledge, "teaching for the sake of teaching," so students often "studied books to death." The socialist education policy is to combine education with productive labor, and to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. This requires that book knowledge and production practice be closely linked in teaching, so as to "study books alive." How to link them? The teachers of Harbin No. 18 Middle School and No. 10 Middle School have explored preliminary experiences in combining teaching and productive labor, book knowledge and production knowledge in practice. Their experience mainly has two aspects: on the one hand, to find the key points of the curriculum content in classroom teaching that are related to production practice, and use production practice to conduct classroom teaching, so that students can more firmly understand and master book knowledge; on the other hand, in various production labor, pay close attention to combining various theoretical knowledge of classroom teaching, so that theory can be verified in practice. The valuable part of this experience is that it does not forget to connect with practice in classroom teaching, and in the activities of production practice, it firmly grasps the actual examples in production to conduct theoretical elaboration. In this way, it not only improves the students' theoretical knowledge, but also enhances their ability to analyze production practice; it not only avoids the students' problem of memorizing and chewing, but also avoids the phenomenon of simply "connecting for the sake of connecting."

Of course, the close combination of teaching and productive labor, book knowledge and production practice is diverse, and the experience of the two middle schools in Harbin is also preliminary. This requires teachers to explore in teaching and summarize a set of relatively systematic teaching methods that conform to the socialist education policy, in order to further realize the principle of linking theory with practice and truly cultivate all-round developed people.

    教师的新职责
    祖年
    教师要把书教好，只是向学生传授书本知识还不够，还要在教学过程中把书本知识同生产实践密切地联系起来。这样，就可以使学生既能从字面上了解书本知识，还能通过生产实践真正理会书本知识中的原理，并在实际中运用和发挥。这是教师把书教好的职责。哈尔滨十八中、十中的教师们，在教学中，真正地担负起了这个教师的光荣职责，因而教学质量不断提高，得到优良成绩的学生增多了。
    过去，教师们只是教书本知识，“为教书而教书”，因而学生们也往往是“死读书”。社会主义的教育方针是教育和生产劳动相结合，要培养出有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者。这就必须在教学中把书本知识和生产实践密切联系起来，作到“活读书”。怎样联系呢？哈尔滨十八中和十中的教师们，在实践中摸索出了教学和生产劳动、书本知识和生产知识相结合的初步经验。他们的经验主要有两个方面：一方面，把课堂教学中的课程内容，找出联系生产实际的关键地方，用生产实际进行课堂讲授，使学生们更巩固地理解和掌握书本知识；另一方面，在多种多样的生产劳动中，密切注意结合各种课堂教学的理论知识，使理论在实际中得到验证。这个经验的可贵之处，就是在课堂教学时不忘联系实际，在生产实践的活动中，又紧紧抓住生产中的实际例子，进行理论上的阐述。这样，既提高了学生们的理论知识，又增强了学生们对生产实际进行分析的能力；既避免了学生们死记硬啃的毛病，又避免了单纯地“为联系而联系”的现象。
    当然，教学和生产劳动、书本知识和生产实践的密切结合是多种多样的，哈尔滨两个中学的经验也是初步的。这就要求教师们在教学中多方摸索，总结出一套比较系统的符合于社会主义教育方针的教学方法，以进一步实现理论联系实际的原则，真正培养出全面发展的人。
