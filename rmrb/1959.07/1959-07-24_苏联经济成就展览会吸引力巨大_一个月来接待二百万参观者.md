Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 22nd: The Soviet National Economic Achievements Exhibition has received over two million visitors from all over the country and the world in the month since it opened. This is a 50% increase compared to the number of visitors to the Soviet Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition during the same period last year. This demonstrates the great appeal and educational significance of this year's exhibition.

    This was stated by Bogdanov, the president of the Soviet National Economic Achievements Exhibition, during a recent interview with our reporter. He said that our exhibition is completely different from exhibitions in capitalist countries. The purpose of exhibitions in capitalist countries is nothing more than to make deals. Our exhibition, on the other hand, is purely for the purpose of exchanging advanced production experiences and promoting the rapid advancement of the cause of communist construction. This is why the Soviet people like to call the Soviet National Economic Achievements Exhibition a "university of advanced experience."

    He said: The Soviet National Economic Achievements Exhibition fully reflects the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU in June. All the exhibition halls display the latest and most advanced technological achievements of the Soviet Union for visitors to study and research. He went on to say that in order to systematically organize visitors to exchange and learn advanced experiences, the exhibition management committee began inviting advanced representatives from the front lines of industrial and agricultural labor across the country on July 1st. So far, representatives from more than 9,000 industrial enterprises, state farms, and collective farms have come here to take turns to specifically visit and study for five days. In addition to visiting the exhibition, these representatives also went to more than 180 industrial enterprises, scientific and technological research institutions, state farms, and collective farms in Moscow to conduct in-depth practical learning.

    Bogdanov said that during this period, the exhibition also organized more than 100 lectures, reports, etc. Famous scholars and advanced producers gave detailed introductions to the Soviet Union's advanced scientific and technological achievements.

    In addition, the exhibition also published more than 2,000 kinds of pamphlets introducing advanced technologies.

    Bogdanov concluded by saying that in one month, more than 10,000 foreign guests from 53 countries have visited the exhibition, including 2,400 from the German Democratic Republic, 1,450 from Czechoslovakia, and 710 from the United States. These foreign guests included various experts and ordinary tourists. After visiting, they all praised the exhibition.

    苏联经济成就展览会吸引力巨大
    一个月来接待二百万参观者
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联国民经济成就展览会开幕一个月来已经接待了二百多万来自全国各地和世界各国的参观者。比去年同期的苏联工农业展览会参观者的数目增加了50％。这说明今年的展览会有巨大的吸引力，更有巨大的教育意义。
    这是苏联国民经济展览会会长鲍格达诺夫最近接见本社记者时说的。他说，我们的展览会与资本主义国家的展览会绝然不同。资本主义国家举行展览会的目的不外是要做买卖。而我们的展览会则纯粹为的是交流先进生产经验，推动共产主义建设事业迅速前进。这就是为什么苏联人爱把苏联国民经济成就展览会称为“先进经验的大学”的原因。
    他说：苏联国民经济成就展览会充分地反映了苏共6月中央全会的精神，各个展览馆都展出了苏联最新、最先进的技术成就，供参观者学习研究。他接着说，为了有计划地组织参观者交流和学习先进经验，自7月1日起，展览会管理委员会开始邀请了全国各地工农业劳动战线上的先进代表。到现在，已有九千多个工业企业、国营农场、集体农庄的代表到这里来轮流专门参观学习五天。这些代表除了参观展览会之外，还到莫斯科一百八十多个工业企业、科学技术研究机关、国营农场、集体农庄去深入实地学习。
    鲍格达诺夫说，这期间，展览会还组织了一百多次讲座、报告会等。著名的学者、先进生产者详细地介绍了苏联先进的科学技术成就。
    此外展览会还出版了二千多种介绍先进技术的小册子。
    鲍格达诺夫最后说：一月来，已有五十三个国家的一万多个外国客人参观了展览会，其中包括德意志民主共和国二千四百人，捷克斯洛伐克一千四百五十人，美国七百一十人。这些外国客人中有各种各样的专家，也有普通的旅行参观者。他们参观后对展览会一致给予了好评。
