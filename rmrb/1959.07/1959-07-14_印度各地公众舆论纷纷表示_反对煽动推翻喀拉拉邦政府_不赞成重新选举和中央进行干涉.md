Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 13th: The people, social figures, people's organizations, and the vast majority of public opinion in Kerala State and across India express disapproval of the current incitement movement carried out by the opposition party in Kerala State, and oppose holding re-elections in Kerala State and central interference in Kerala State.

According to the Press Trust of India, farmers in Trichur, Kerala State, held a demonstration on the 10th. General Secretary of the All-India Kisan Sabha, Bhawani Sen, spoke at a mass meeting, strongly protesting against the incitement movement and central interference. He said that the Kisan Sabha had decided to request the central government and other state governments to adopt land laws following the principles of the regulations recently formulated by the Kerala State government.

The latest issue of the "New Kerala" weekly reported that the Kerala State Teachers' United Front submitted a memorandum to Nehru last week, accusing the Congress Party of leading the incitement movement, as well as conducting so-called "picketing" activities at school gates and burning houses.

The All-India Trade Union Congress organization in Kerala State listed facts in a memorandum to Nehru, explaining how much good the Kerala State government had done for the people there, and protesting against the current incitement movement.

The leader of the Indian Church Union in Bombay, Williams, issued a statement condemning the incitement movement launched in Kerala State.

Twelve Christian leaders in Bangalore issued a joint statement asking the Kerala State Church to "seriously consider its" "responsibility" for the incitement movement.

The editor of the "Blitz" weekly, Karanjia, published an open letter to Nehru, saying that the people would not allow the Kerala State government to be overthrown by "such unconstitutional means of incitement, because that would mean overturning the standards of democracy and the constitution."

The Press Trust of India reported that Mrs. Rameshvari Nehru, Chairman of the Indian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, said in Hyderabad last week that it was very unfortunate that some people were conspiring to overthrow the Kerala State government, which was elected and established according to the constitution, by unconstitutional means.

Even some prominent Congress Party figures have expressed dissatisfaction with the incitement movement and central interference. According to the Press Trust of India, Punjab Governor Gadgil has twice emphasized that the Kerala State government should be allowed to perform its duties throughout its term, and that the basic principles of democracy should not be undermined. There are also reports that two former federal ministers, Deshmukh and Mahavir Tyagi, also oppose central interference. Some Congress Party members, including Feroze Gandhi, Sharma, and P. Subbarayan, recently expressed their dissatisfaction with central interference to Prime Minister Nehru. Even former Federal Labor Minister Khandubhai Desai said that in view of the possible impact of central interference in other parts of India, such interference should be avoided in Kerala State.

At the same time, newspapers such as "Unity Daily" and "Liberation Daily" published editorials and commentaries opposing the attitude adopted by the Congress Party towards the Kerala State government. The "Free Press" published twenty letters from readers on July 5, unanimously expressing dissatisfaction with the incitement movement and central interference in Kerala State.

    印度各地公众舆论纷纷表示
    反对煽动推翻喀拉拉邦政府
    不赞成重新选举和中央进行干涉
    新华社新德里13日电　喀拉拉邦和印度各地的人民群众、社会人士、人民团体和绝大多数的舆论表示不赞成目前喀拉拉邦反对党进行的煽动运动，并且反对在喀拉拉邦重新举行选举和中央对喀拉拉邦的干涉。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，喀拉拉邦的特里丘尔的农民10日举行了示威游行，全印农民协会总书记鲍瓦尼·森在群众大会上讲话，强烈抗议煽动运动和中央干涉。他说，农民协会决定要求中央和其他邦政府按照喀拉拉邦政府最近制定的条例的方针来通过土地法。
    最近一期的“新喀拉拉”周刊报道，喀拉拉邦的教师联合阵线上星期向尼赫鲁提出一项备忘录，控诉国大党带头进行煽动运动，以及在学校门口进行所谓“纠察”活动和烧毁房屋的行为。
    全印工会大会在喀拉拉邦的组织在致尼赫鲁的备忘录中列举事实，说明喀拉拉邦政府对那边的人民做了多少好事，并且抗议目前的煽动运动。
    孟买印度教会联合会领导人威廉斯发表声明谴责在喀拉拉邦发动的煽动运动。
    班加罗尔的十二位基督教领袖发表联合声明要求喀拉拉邦教会“严肃认真地考虑它们”对煽动运动“所负的责任”。
      “闪电”周报主编卡朗吉亚发表了给尼赫鲁的公开信，他说，人民是不会允许用“这种不符合宪法的煽动运动的手段来推翻喀拉拉邦政府的，因为那将意味着推翻民主和宪法的尺度”。
  　印度报业托辣斯报道，印度亚非团结委员会主席拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人上星期在海得拉巴说，有人阴谋用不合宪法的手段来推翻根据宪法选举出来和成立的喀拉拉邦政府，是非常不幸的。
    甚至一些著名的国大党人士对于煽动运动和中央干涉也表示不满。据印度报业托辣斯报道，旁遮普邦邦长加德吉尔曾经两次强调指出，应该让喀拉拉邦政府在整个任期内执行它的职责，不应该破坏民主的基本原则。还有消息说，两位前联邦部长德希穆克和马哈维尔·特雅吉也反对中央干涉。一些国大党议员，其中包括费罗斯·甘地、夏尔马和普·苏巴拉延最近向尼赫鲁总理表示他们对中央干涉感到不满。甚至前联邦劳工部长康杜巴伊·德赛也说，鉴于中央干涉在印度其它地方可能产生的影响，因此在喀拉拉邦应该避免这种干涉。
    同时，“团结报”、“解放报”等报纸发表社论和评论反对国大党对喀拉拉邦政府所采取的态度。7月5日“自由新闻”刊载了二十封读者来信对在喀拉拉邦进行的煽动运动和中央干涉一致表示不满。
