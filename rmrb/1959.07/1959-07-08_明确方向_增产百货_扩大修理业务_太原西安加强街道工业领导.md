Clarify Direction, Increase Production of General Merchandise, Expand Repair Services
Taiyuan and Xi'an Strengthen Leadership of Street Industries

(Our Dispatch) While rectifying street factories, Taiyuan City has explicitly proposed that the development direction of street industries should be to actively increase the production of various daily-use general merchandise and expand processing and repair services to meet the needs of urban people's lives.

Last year, Taiyuan City established 220 street factories, most of which, in addition to a portion of smelting, manufacturing, and refractory material factories, served the daily lives of urban people. Since the opening of street industries, more than 200 production avenues have been opened, capable of producing more than 3,000 products. However, due to the rapid development of street industries and a lack of management experience, some factories blindly pursued large-scale and comprehensive production without regard to raw materials and technical conditions, leading to abnormal phenomena in production. To change this situation, the district committees have rectified street factories successively since March. During the rectification, the first step was to strengthen the Party's leadership over street industries. In addition to establishing management agencies, some district committees also assigned a deputy secretary to specifically lead street industries. Secondly, it was clarified that the principle of developing street industries must be to develop their businesses based on meeting the needs of urban people's lives, that is, developing production according to the principles of "adapting to local conditions, using local materials, producing locally, making do with whatever is available, and facilitating the masses." After this principle was implemented throughout the city, most of the 141 factories in 36 streets are now turning to the production of daily-use industrial products such as knitwear, sewing, small hardware, papermaking, shoemaking, food, and ceramic bottles. There are also plans to arrange for the production of another batch of daily-use general merchandise and small hardware such as towels, canvas belts, hoes, and steel saws. In terms of processing and repair services, the city's street industries, in addition to expanding the original 50-plus items such as furniture, bicycle, and radio repair, have also added more than 10 industries such as washing and dyeing, wood repair, and pot repair.

Due to the strengthening of the Party's leadership over street industries and the clarification of direction, the city's more than 15,000 street factory workers are full of production enthusiasm, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and materials in every possible way, and producing a large number of daily necessities. They have played a certain role in meeting market needs.

(Our Dispatch) The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently organized some street factories (cooperatives or groups) in the rectification of street industries, inherited and promoted the fine tradition of facilitating the masses, vigorously restored and expanded repair services, and made full use of waste materials for the production of small commodities.

In the 1958 nationwide industrial campaign, more than 580 street factories (cooperatives or groups) were established in Xi'an City, with more than 16,000 employees, many of whom were skilled workers who used to be engaged in repair services and the manufacture of daily-use industrial products as handicraftsmen. However, after the industrialization of production, some street industrial workers did not fully understand the important significance of small commodity production and repair work, and there was a tendency to look up to large factories, emphasizing standardization; they were willing to produce large products in batches, but unwilling to make sporadic small products; they emphasized manufacturing, but unwilling to engage in repair; and some factories even competed with large factories for raw materials and tasks. In light of the above situation, the Municipal Party Committee decided to universally expand and restore repair services and increase production by using waste materials in street industries during the campaign to increase production and practice economy, so that industrial products could better meet the needs of the masses' production and life.

At the beginning, some street industrial workers believed that repairing old things was not as glorious as producing new things, and some were afraid that there would not be many old things to repair. To solve these problems, each district found some street factories in different industries to try out the restoration and expansion of repair services. The results of the pilot project proved that after the street industries restored repair services, they had the following advantages: the production tasks were greatly increased compared with the past; the problem of raw materials was also easier to solve; repairing the old as new extended the service life of the products, relatively increasing the products and alleviating the situation that the supply of some industrial products could not meet the demand due to the increasing purchasing power of the masses and the need to expand production, which was generally welcomed by the masses. In the past, the Shangde Road Rubber Products Factory in Xincheng District mainly produced rubber parts such as shuttle thread covers and cotton comb joints for textile factories. This year, production was affected due to the shortage of raw materials. Recently, in restoring repair services, they found that some textile factories were affected by the inability to buy V-belts. They took back a few old V-belts from the Dahua Textile Factory for trial repair. The repaired V-belts were fully usable and had a service life of about half that of new belts. They also sent people to residents' homes, schools, factories, and construction sites to repair broken rubber shoes. According to statistics, repairing 100 pairs of rubber shoes requires an average of only 4 kilograms of rubber, while producing the same number of rubber shoes requires about 75 kilograms of rubber; buying a pair of ordinary rubber shoes costs 5 to 6 yuan, and producing a pair of long-tube rubber shoes costs more than 10 yuan, while repairing a pair costs only a few cents. After this factory carried out repair services, there were many production tasks, which were warmly welcomed and praised by the masses. They said: In the past, it was impossible to find a place to repair rubber shoes after walking several streets, but now they are sent to the door for repair, which is cheap, good, and convenient.

After the pilot project in each district, the city's street industries have now universally restored and expanded repair services. In the past, the Xinming Street Construction Cooperative only built new houses and did not do small repairs and other sporadic work. Recently, to facilitate the masses, the cooperative sent specialists to help citizens inspect their houses, and if there was any rain leakage, they would schedule time to repair them from house to house. Many carpentry cooperatives and bamboo ware cooperatives also repair steamers, bellows, wooden basins, wooden buckets, umbrellas, and other wooden utensils; hardware cooperatives and hardware stores have restored the business of patching leaky pots, welding tin kettles, matching keys, and repairing locks; sewing, shoes, and hats production cooperatives (factories) also actively accept repair sewing, turning over old clothes, and other work.

While restoring repair services, the street factories also used waste materials and by-products from large factories, enterprises, and institutions to expand the production of daily-use industrial products. The relevant departments investigated the specifications and quantities of waste materials that many large and medium-sized factories do not use, and some districts also organized street industrial workers to visit large factories to see the waste materials so that each factory could go back and study how to make small commodities according to the materials. For example, the waste materials of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory can be used by dozens of small factories to produce small commodities such as hair clips, eyelets, thermos bottle caps, bottle ears, eyeglass cases, backpack iron parts, and book nails. The Dongwulu Woodware Cooperative used waste materials from the lumber factory to make small chairs, small stools, and wooden brushes, and also used waste paper and broken glass slag to make sandpaper, which is currently in urgent demand in the market.

    明确方向　增产百货　扩大修理业务
    太原西安加强街道工业领导
    本报讯　太原市在整顿街道工厂的同时，明确提出了街道工业的发展方向应该是积极增产各种日用百货和扩大加工、修补业务，以满足城市人民生活需要。
    去年，太原市办起了二百二十座街道工厂，其中除了一部分熔炼、制造和耐火材料厂以外，大多数是为城市人民生活服务的。街道工业开办以来，已经开辟了二百多种生产门路，能生产三千多种产品。但是，由于街道工业发展迅速，又缺乏管理经验，有些工厂不根据原料和技术条件盲目地贪大求全，生产上出现了不正常现象。为了改变这种状况，各区委3月份以来对街道工厂先后进行了整顿。在整顿当中，首先是加强了党对街道工业的领导，各区委除增设管理机构外，有的还抽出一名副书记专门领导街道工业。其次是明确了发展街道工业的方针必须是从满足城市人民生活的需要来发展自己的业务，也就是以“因地制宜、就地取材、就地生产、因陋就简、便利群众”的原则发展生产。这一方针在全市得到贯彻以后，现在三十六条街道的一百四十一个工厂，绝大部分是转向生产针织、缝纫、小五金、造纸、制鞋、食品、陶瓶等日用工业品。还准备再安排一批毛巾、帆布腰带、锄头、钢锯等日用百货和小五金生产。在加工、修补等服务性行业方面，全市街道工业除扩大原有的修理家具、自行车、收音机等五十多项外，还增添了洗染、修理木器、修锅等十多种行业。
    由于加强了党对街道工业的领导，明确了方向，全市一万五千余名街道工厂的职工生产情绪饱满，千方百计克服原料和材料不足的困难，生产了大批人民生活必需品。对满足市场需要，起了一定的作用。
    本报讯　中共西安市委最近在整顿街道工业中，组织了一些街道工厂（社或组），继承和发扬便利群众的优良传统，大力恢复和扩大修理业务，充分利用废料进行小商品生产。
    在1958年全民办工业运动中，西安市办起了五百八十多个街巷工厂（社或组），共有一万六千多职工，其中有不少技术工人过去是搞修理业务和日用工业品制造的手工业者。但是，生产工厂化以后，有些街巷工业职工对小商品生产和修理工作的重要意义认识不足，存在向大厂看齐思想，强调正规化；愿意成批生产大型产品，不愿意作零星的小产品；强调制造，不愿意搞修理；甚至有个别厂还与大厂争原料争任务。市委根据上述情况，决定在开展增产节约运动中，街巷工业普遍扩大和恢复修理业务，利用废旧材料增产。用工业品更好的满足群众生产、生活需要。
    开始时，有些街巷工业职工认为修补破旧东西不如生产新东西光荣，也有人怕没多少旧东西可修理。为了解决这些问题。各区都找出一些不同行业的街巷工厂试办恢复和扩大修理业务。试办结果证明，街巷工业恢复修理业务之后有下列好处：生产任务比过去大大增加了；原材料问题也容易解决；整旧如新，延长了产品的使用寿命，相对的增加了产品，缓和部分工业品在群众购买力日益提高和生产扩大需要增加供不应求的情况，受到了群众的普遍欢迎。新城区尚德路橡胶制品厂过去主要是生产纺织厂用的梭信套、梳棉接头等橡胶零件，今年因为原料缺乏生产曾受到影响。最近在恢复修理业务中，他们发现有些纺织厂因买不到三角带影响生产。就从大华纺织厂拿回几根旧三角带试修，修理后的三角带完全可以使用，寿命约相当于新带的一半。他们还抽出人到居民家里、学校、工厂和工地修理破烂胶鞋。据统计，修理一百双胶鞋平均只用四公斤橡胶，而生产同样数量的胶鞋约需七十五公斤橡胶；买一双普通胶鞋需要五至六元，生产用长筒胶鞋需十元以上，而修理一双只需要几角钱。这个厂开展修理业务后，生产任务很多，受到群众热烈欢迎和赞扬，他们说：过去走几道街找不到修胶鞋的，现在送上门来修理，又便宜又好又方便。
    各区在试办之后，目前全市街巷工业已经普遍恢复和扩大了修理业务。新明街建筑社过去只修建新房，不干小修小补等零星活。最近，为了便利群众，这个社抽出专人帮助市民检查房子，如有漏雨现象的即排定时间挨户修理。很多木器社和竹器社都兼修蒸笼、风箱、木盆、木桶、雨伞和其它木器用具；铁器社和五金社恢复了补漏锅、焊洋铁壶、配钥匙、修锁子等业务；缝纫、鞋帽等生产社（厂）也都积极接受修理缝补、翻改旧衣等活路。
    在与恢复修理业务的同时，各街巷工厂还利用大型工厂、企业、机关等单位的废旧料和副产品，扩大日用工业品的生产。有关部门对很多大、中型工厂不用的废料的规格，数量进行调查，有些区还组织街巷工业的职工到大厂参观废料，以便各厂回去研究量材制造小商品。例如西安人民搪瓷厂的废料可以供几十个小厂作为生产发卡、气眼、热水瓶盖、瓶耳、眼镜盒、背包铁件、书钉等小商品。东五路木器社利用木材厂的废料制成小椅子和小凳子、木刷等小商品，又用废纸和碎玻璃渣制成目前市场急需的砂纸。
