Why Does the United States Interfere in Cuba?
孔迈　炳庵

From the very first day of the establishment of the Cuban revolutionary government, US imperialism has never ceased its activities and clamors of interference in Cuba. These conspiracy activities of interference in Cuba became even more rampant after the promulgation of the Cuban Land Reform Law. In a note to the Cuban government on June 11, the U.S. State Department openly expressed dissatisfaction with Cuba's land reform and unreasonably demanded that the Cuban government "further exchange views" with the United States on the consequences that the land reform law would cause. Recently, they have even threatened to directly intervene in Cuba militarily and have begun preparing for such military intervention in various ways. Why are the U.S. imperialists so hostile to the independent Cuban people? Why do they not allow the Cuban people the freedom to handle their own affairs?

(1) The United States Once Used Armed Intervention to Pave the Way for Economic Plunder

The recent fifty years of Cuban history is a history of the brutal plunder of American monopoly organizations, a history interwoven with the blood and tears of the Cuban people. The U.S. capital's plunder of Cuba began by paving the way with force. As early as 1898, when Cuban patriots were fighting against Spanish colonialism and for independence, U.S. imperialists intervened in Cuba. Since then, Cuba has been under U.S. military occupation for several years. The United States stipulated the constitutional guidelines for Cuba and supported the puppet regime in Cuba. Until 1934, the United States had been using the Platt Amendment, which it imposed on Cuba, as the "basis" for its interference in Cuba. By invoking this constitutional amendment, the United States still maintains a naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba.

Under the cover of military aggression, U.S. monopoly capital forcibly created a colonial economy in Cuba in order to extract huge profits. On the one hand, the United States unilaterally invested in the sugar industry, turning Cuba into a single-product country, thereby facilitating its domination and exploitation. On the other hand, it dumped large quantities of American goods, occupied the Cuban market, and strangled the development of Cuban national industries.

(2) The Yankees Control Cuba's Economic Lifeline

Sugar production is the main source of Cuba's national income. Sugar exports account for 80% to 90% of Cuba's total exports. However, 54% of the sugar production capacity is in the hands of U.S. monopoly capital. The Cuban Atlantic Sugar Company controls 8% to 9% of Cuba's sugar production. Hershey Chocolate Company and the Rockefeller Consortium have a large influence in the Cuban sugar industry. The Rockefeller Consortium controls the Alegre Sugar Company and the South Puerto Rico Sugar Company. The Rionda Company controls 6% of Cuba's total sugar milling. The Dulles brothers' law firm has close ties with these companies. American Sugar Refining Company and United Fruit Company also have large investments in the Cuban sugar industry. The Lehman and Astor Consortiums control shares in the Camaguey Sugar Company. The big bosses of these sugar companies are the actual decision-makers of the U.S. State Department's policy toward Cuba.

In terms of trade, U.S. monopoly capital controlled 74% of Cuba's imports as early as 1917 through the bilateral trade treaty of 1902. Due to the bilateral trade agreement of 1934, the United States even controlled 91% of Cuba's imports in 1940. Currently, two-thirds of Cuba's total exports are to the United States, and three-quarters of its total imports are from the United States. Apart from the sugar industry, Cuba has almost no industry, neither heavy nor light. Cuba produces various fruits, but 100% of the canned fruits are imported from the United States. Cuba, known for its sugar production, imports 67% of its chocolate and candies from the United States. Cuba has a long coastline, but 90% of the canned fish it consumes has to be imported from foreign countries. In the daily necessities of the Cuban people, even things like toothpicks have to be imported from the United States. Although Cuba is an agricultural country, due to the single-crop economy created by the United States, Cuba has to spend 150 million pesos every year to import 30% of its required grain from the United States. U.S. Senator Smathers, who has clamored for interference in Cuba and repeatedly suggested organizing a Pan-American "police force" to suppress the Cuban revolution, is a big landlord and a rice merchant who exports rice from Florida to Cuba.

In addition, U.S. monopoly enterprises also control half of Cuba's railways, about one-third of its banking business, and most of its mining, public utilities, and processing industries. All postal and telecommunications services and electricity supplies are controlled by American trusts.

Cuba's most important mineral is nickel. The exploitation of this metal, which is very important in military industry, is controlled by the U.S. government and Freeport Sulphur Company. Cuba's largest enterprise, Cuban Electric Company, is a subsidiary of American New York International Telephone and Telegraph Company, which is controlled by the American Morgan Consortium's First National City Bank. The current U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Bonsal, had been a senior executive in International Telephone and Telegraph Company for many years.

In the past, U.S. monopoly organizations imposed a banking, currency, loan, and tax system on Cuba that only benefited them. Through the law on stopping debt repayment on schedule and the banking settlement law of 1921, drafted by American lawyers, American financial groups then controlled all of Cuba's banking business. The main banks in Cuba are the American First National City Bank and the Manhattan-Chase Bank. The loan system stipulated by the United States only benefited American capitalists in creating sugar monoculture and occupying the Cuban market. According to materials from 1940, 43% of bank loans were concentrated in the sugar industry, 45% of loans were concentrated in trade, and mainly in import trade. Loans in industry, however, only accounted for 0.4%. The past financial, tax and tariff systems were also tools to ensure the exploitation by U.S. monopoly capital.

(3) How the Yankees Became Cuba's Biggest Landowners

Seizing land is one of the main means by which U.S. monopoly capital plunders Cuba. After years of forcible seizure and looting of Cuban farmers, the big U.S. sugar companies became Cuba's major landowners. In the sugar industry, twenty-three U.S. companies opened thirty-nine sugar mills, occupying a total of 72,000 caballeries of land (each caballeria is approximately equivalent to 201.28 Chinese mu); in addition, they leased or used under contract 36,000 caballeries, totaling 108,000 caballeries. If we add the more than 50,000 caballeries of land occupied by U.S. companies in mineral leases and other aspects, then the total area of land controlled by U.S. imperialists in Cuba reaches more than 160,000 caballeries, accounting for more than 25% of Cuba's total area, and these are precisely the best lands. American enterprises are also the largest landowners engaged in animal husbandry. American sugar companies also engage in animal husbandry. For example, a large part of the more than 70,000 caballeries of ranches in Camaguey Province taken over by the National Land Reform Commission on June 20 belonged to American companies. Nearly 4,000 caballeries of the land taken over belonged to the Gulf-Atlantic Sugar Company. More than 2,000 caballeries belonged to the Adelas Fagg Company. More than 2,000 caballeries belonged to the Francisco Sugar Company. The American animal husbandry monopoly organization King Ranch is the largest livestock estate in Camaguey and Oriente provinces. It occupies vast tracts of land in Camaguey Province from Nuevitas in the north of the province to the coast of Guayabal in the south.

American robbers used extremely cruel methods to seize Cuban land. There are three main ways of plundering. First, annexing Cuba's state-owned land. When the American interventionists occupied Cuba in 1899-1902, they promulgated the so-called Military Decree No. 62 on the boundaries of companies and manors, arbitrarily allocating Cuban land to themselves. The so-called Military Decree No. 43 promulgated by the United States made it possible for American companies to occupy large tracts of land by building private railways. Second, forcibly driving farmers from their land. For example, the American King Ranch drove farmers away by force, destroyed the crops planted by farmers, burned their houses, used tractors to rampage against women and children, and used rural police to massacre farmers, thereby seizing vast tracts of land. Cuban peasant leader Pubo was murdered in this way in 1946. As another example, last April, the Francisco Sugar Company and King Ranch, with the support of Batista's army, forcibly drove away 250 farmers. Third, acquiring land at extremely low prices. For example, according to an official document, in 1905, the Nipe Bay Company "purchased" more than 3,700 caballeries of land on the north coast of Oriente Province for only one hundred dollars. This land is currently occupied by the Preston and Boston sugar mills.

These American companies leave a large amount of land they occupy idle and do not use it for production. The Francisco Sugar Company only uses one-third of the land it occupies to plant sugarcane. The Lamanati Sugar Company uses less than one-tenth of its land for production. On the other hand, 63.7% of Cuban farmers have no land and have to cultivate on the land of landlords.

(4) The United States Is Attempting to Use Force to Maintain Its Heinous Plunder of the Cuban People

Relying on their various enterprises and large tracts of land in Cuba, American monopoly capitalists are carrying out heinous plunder and exploitation of the Cuban people. According to incomplete materials, the total amount of American investment in Cuba is about 1 billion U.S. dollars. However, from 1952 to 1957, the profits obtained by American companies reached 750 million U.S. dollars. The profits obtained by these companies accounted for 30% or even 500% of the capital they owned.

The vast majority of Cuban working people live in extreme poverty due to the cruel exploitation and enslavement by U.S. imperialists. There are 700,000 unemployed people, accounting for one-third of the labor force. Among the 500,000 agricultural workers, only 53,000 have permanent jobs. The rest work an average of four months and three days a year. The average income of agricultural workers is only 45 pesos per month for a family of six. In the countryside, we see dilapidated thatched houses and ragged or even naked peasant children everywhere.

The Cuban people can no longer tolerate this state of enslavement and deprivation. On January 1 this year, the Cuban people, under the leadership of Fidel Castro, overthrew the dictatorship of Batista, the agent of U.S. monopoly capital.

As soon as Fidel Castro entered Havana, he declared to the world that Cuba should not only be politically independent, but also economically independent. On May 17, the revolutionary government promulgated the Land Reform Law in the Sierra Maestra Mountains, and is currently drafting financial, tax and tariff reform laws and other revolutionary measures to get rid of the economic shackles of American monopoly organizations, protect and develop national industries, and improve the people's living standards. The Cuban people and government, under the leadership of Castro, are firmly implementing land reform.

The Cuban people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and enslavement has greatly encouraged the people of the entire Latin America who are under the oppression and aggression of the United States; at the same time, the people of Latin American countries have given the Cuban people sympathy and support. A Peruvian representative stated at the land reform debate held in Havana: The people of Latin American countries must share life and death, and share weal and woe. At present, a storm of demands for independence and anti-Americanism has swept the entire Latin American region from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego.

This situation, which is extremely unfavorable to U.S. monopoly capital, has caused panic in Washington. The big American bosses are not willing to give up their plunder and enslavement of the Cuban people and the people of other Latin American countries. However, history will not go backwards. The people of Latin America are increasingly awakened, and their unity is increasingly strengthened. The U.S. conspiracy to interfere in Cuba and other Latin American countries will surely encounter strong resistance. The people of Latin American countries will one day break through the shackles of U.S. imperialism.

    美国为什么要干涉古巴？
    孔迈　炳庵
    自从古巴革命政府成立的第一天起，美帝国主义就没有停止过干涉古巴的活动和叫嚣。这种干涉古巴的阴谋活动在古巴土地改革法公布以后变得更加嚣张。美国国务院在6月11日致古巴政府的照会中公然对古巴的土地改革表示不满，并且无理要求古巴政府就土地改革法将引起的后果同美国“进一步交换意见”。最近他们甚至扬言要直接对古巴进行武装干涉，并且已经开始为这种武装干涉从多方面着手准备。为什么美帝国主义对取得独立的古巴人民这样仇视呢？为什么他们不让古巴人民有处理自己的事务的自由呢？
      （一）美国曾以武装干涉为经济掠夺开拓道路
    古巴最近五十年的历史是遭受美国垄断组织野蛮掠夺的历史，是古巴人民血泪交织的历史。美国资本对古巴的掠夺一开始就是以武力来开拓道路的。早在1898年当古巴爱国者为反对西班牙殖民主义者和争取独立而斗争的时候，美帝国主义者就干涉了古巴。自那时起，古巴有好几年是处在美国的军事占领下。美国规定了古巴的宪法准则，并扶植了古巴的傀儡政权。到1934年为止，美国一直利用它强加于古巴的普拉特修正案作为它干涉古巴的“根据”。由于引用这条宪法修正案，直到现在，美国仍然在古巴的关塔那摩保有海军基地。
    在军事侵略的掩护下，美国垄断资本在古巴强制地造成一种殖民地经济，以便榨取巨额利润。一方面，美国在糖业部门片面进行投资，使古巴变成单一生产国，从而便于它进行统治和剥削。另一方面，大量倾销美国货，占领古巴市场，扼杀古巴民族工业的发展。
    （二）美国佬掌握着古巴的经济命脉
    糖的生产是古巴国民收入的主要来源。糖的出口占古巴出口总额的80％到90％。但是糖生产能力的54％操在美国垄断资本的手里。古巴大西洋糖公司就控制了古巴食糖生产的8％到9％。赫尔希巧克力公司和洛克菲勒财团在古巴制糖业中有很大势力。洛克菲勒财团控制了阿莱格雷角糖公司和南波多黎各糖公司。里翁达公司控制着古巴榨糖总量的6％。杜勒斯兄弟的律师事务所和这些公司有密切的关系。美国制糖公司和联合果品公司在古巴制糖业中也有大量投资。利曼和阿斯特财团则控制了卡马圭糖公司的股份。这些糖业公司的大老板是美国国务院对古巴政策的实际决策人。
    在贸易方面，美国垄断资本通过1902年的双边贸易条约，早在1917年就已经控制了古巴进口额的74％。由于1934年的双边贸易协定，美国在1940年甚至控制了古巴进口额的91％。目前，古巴全部出口的三分之二是输往美国，全部进口的四分之三来自美国。除制糖业之外，古巴几乎没有任何工业，既没有重工业也没有轻工业。古巴出产各种水果，但是百分之百的水果罐头都是从美国进口的。以产糖著称的古巴，67％的巧克力和糖果是从美国进口的。古巴有很长的海岸线，可是它所消费的鱼类罐头却有90％要从外国进口。古巴人民的日常用品中，像牙签这样的东西都要从美国进口。虽然古巴是个农业国，但由于存在着美国一手造成的单一经济作物制，古巴每年却不得不花费一亿五千万比索从美国进口本国所需粮食的30％。曾大肆嚎叫干涉古巴并多次建议组织泛美“警察部队”去镇压古巴革命的美国参议员斯马瑟斯就是一个大地主和从佛罗里达州向古巴输出大米的商人。
    此外，美国垄断企业还控制了古巴一半的铁路，大约三分之一的银行业务，大部分矿业、公用事业和加工工业。所有的邮电业务和电力供应都掌握在美国托辣斯手中。
    古巴最重要的矿产是镍。这种在军事工业上非常重要的金属的开采，是掌握在美国政府和弗利波特硫磺公司的手里。古巴最大的企业——古巴电力公司是美国摩根财团的第一花旗银行所控制的美国纽约国际电话电报公司的子公司。美国驻古巴的现任大使邦沙尔就曾在国际电话电报公司当过很多年高级职员。
    在过去，美国垄断组织把一项只是对它们有利的银行、货币、贷款和税收制度强加于古巴。通过美国律师拟订的停止按期偿还债务法和1921年的银行结算法，美国财阀那时曾控制了古巴全部银行业务。在古巴主要的银行就是美国第一花旗银行和曼哈顿—大通银行。美国规定的一套贷款制度只有利于美国资本家在古巴造成糖的单一生产和占领古巴市场。根据1940年的材料，43％的银行贷款集中在制糖业方面，45％的贷款集中在贸易方面，而且主要是进口贸易方面。而在工业方面的贷款却只占0.4％。过去的财政税收及关税制度也是保证美国垄断资本剥削的工具。
    （三）美国佬是怎样成为古巴最大庄园主的
    霸占土地是美国垄断资本对古巴进行掠夺的主要手段之一。经过多年来对古巴农民的强夺劫掠，美国的大糖业公司成了古巴主要的大庄园主。在制糖工业中，二十三家美国公司开设三十九个糖厂，一共占有土地七万二千卡瓦耶里亚（每卡瓦耶里亚约合二零一点二八中国亩）；此外，它们用租赁或按照合同使用的土地有三万六千卡瓦耶里亚，总共十万八千卡瓦耶里亚。如果再加上美国公司在矿产租借和其它方面占有的五万多卡瓦耶里亚土地，那么，美帝国主义者控制古巴土地总面积就达到十六万多卡瓦耶里亚，即占古巴全国面积的25％以上，而这些恰恰是最好的土地。美国企业也是经营牧畜业的最大的庄园主。美国糖业公司也经营牧畜业。例如，土地改革全国委员会6月20日在卡马圭省所接管的面积七万多卡瓦耶里亚的牧场中有很大一部分是美国公司的。被接管的土地中有近四千卡瓦耶里亚是属于海湾—大西洋糖公司的。有两千多卡瓦耶里亚属于阿德拉斯法格公司。有两千多卡瓦耶里亚属于弗朗西斯科糖公司。美国的牧畜业垄断组织金氏牧场是卡马圭省和奥连特省最大的畜牧业庄园。它在卡马圭省占有从该省北部努埃维塔斯到南部的瓜亚巴耳海岸的大片土地。
    美国强盗用极其残酷的办法，夺走古巴的土地。掠夺的主要方式有三种。第一，吞并古巴的国有土地。当1899—1902年美国干涉者占领古巴的时候，他们就颁布了关于公司和庄园辖界的所谓第六十二号军事法令，任意将古巴土地划归己有。而美国公布的所谓第四十三号军事法令，则使得美国公司通过建立私营铁路而占去大片土地。第二，用武力把农民从他们的土地上赶走。例如，美国金氏牧场就曾用武力赶走农民，破坏农民播种的作物，烧毁他们的住宅，用拖拉机向妇女和儿童横冲直撞，利用农村警察屠杀农民，从而夺得广大土地。古巴农民领袖普波在1946年就是这样被杀害的。又如去年4月，弗朗西斯科糖公司和金氏牧场在巴蒂斯塔军队的支持下曾用暴力赶走了二百五十户农民。第三，以极低的价格收购土地。例如，根据一个官方文件，在1905年尼佩·贝公司在奥连特省北海岸仅以一百美元的价格“购买”到三千七百多卡瓦耶里亚的土地。而这片土地目前为普列士顿和波士顿糖厂所占据。
    这些美国公司把所占据的大量土地闲置，不用于生产。弗朗西斯科糖公司只用它所占土地的三分之一去种植甘蔗。拉马纳蒂糖公司用于生产的土地还不到十分之一。而另一方面，古巴有63.7％的农户没有土地，只好在地主的土地上耕种。
    （四）美国正企图以武力维持它对古巴人民穷凶极恶的掠夺
    美国垄断资本家们依靠他们在古巴的各种企业和大片土地，对古巴人民进行着穷凶极恶的掠夺和剥削。据不完全的材料，美国在古巴的投资总额约十亿美元。但是从1952年至1957年，美国公司所获得的利润就达到七亿五千万美元。这些公司所获得的利润，占它们拥有资本的30％甚至500％。
    古巴绝大多数劳动人民，由于美帝国主义者的残酷剥削和奴役，生活极为贫困。失业人口有七十万，占劳动力的三分之一。五十万农业工人中，只有五万三千人有永久性工作。其余的人平均每年工作四个月零三天。农业工人的平均收入是，一个六口之家每月只能得到四十五比索。在农村，我们到处都看到破烂零落的茅舍和衣衫褴褛甚至赤裸的农民孩子。
    古巴人民对这种被奴役和剥夺的状况再也不能忍受。今年1月1日，古巴人民在菲德尔·卡斯特罗领导下推翻了美国垄断资本的代理人——巴蒂斯塔的独裁统治。
    菲德尔·卡斯特罗一进入哈瓦那，就向全世界宣布，古巴不仅要在政治上独立，而且在经济上也要独立。5月17日，革命政府在马埃斯特腊山区颁布了土地改革法，目前正在拟定财政、税收和关税改革法以及其他革命措施，以摆脱美国垄断组织的经济束缚，保护和发展民族工业，提高人民的生活水平。古巴人民和政府在卡斯特罗的领导下，坚定地实现着土地改革。
    古巴人民反对美帝国主义侵略和奴役的斗争，给了在美国的压迫和侵略下的整个拉丁美洲的人民以很大的鼓舞；同时，拉丁美洲各国人民又给古巴人民以同情和支持。一位秘鲁代表在哈瓦那举行的土地改革辩论会上表示：拉丁美洲各国人民要生死与共，安危同济。目前，一片要求独立和反美的风暴，席卷了从格朗德河直到火地岛整个拉丁美洲地区。
    这种对美国垄断资本极端不利的局面引起了华盛顿的慌乱，美国大老板们不甘心放弃他们对古巴人民和拉丁美洲其他各国人民的掠夺和奴役。但是，历史是不会倒退的，拉丁美洲人民已日益觉醒，他们之间的团结日益加强，美国干涉古巴和其他拉丁美洲国家的阴谋一定会遭到强烈的抵抗。拉丁美洲各国人民总有一天会冲破美帝国主义的枷锁。
