    Beijing, July 1st, this paper reports. The broad masses of workers on Tianjin's industrial front are determined to continue to exert their efforts in the third quarter, deeply carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and do everything possible to comprehensively fulfill the state plan, using even greater production achievements to welcome the tenth anniversary of National Day.

    On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the broad masses of workers in Tianjin launched a Red Flag competition campaign focused on improving quality to achieve a continued leap forward in 1959, achieving great success. According to statistics from five districts including Hexi, Hebei, and Hedong as of June 30, more than 280 factories had completed their semi-annual production plans ahead of schedule, and the quality of products had also greatly improved, with the steel qualification rate in June increasing to 96%. From January to May, 2,214 new products were successfully trial-produced in the city, and 895 were put into production. In the first half of this year, the cost of products in the city has also been reduced, with comparable costs decreasing by 1.21% compared with the same period last year. In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, more than 3,000 advanced pacesetters and about 1,000 advanced groups have emerged among the broad masses of workers.

    At present, many factory workers are advancing victoriously, deeply discussing the third quarter plan, focusing on improving product quality, increasing variety, practicing strict economy, striving for high output, and improving labor productivity, and have put forward many rationalization proposals and technical organizational measures. The production level of the city's light industry system in the first half of the year increased by 56.2% compared with the same period last year. Now, workers are continuing to carry out the competition campaign of "high quality, low consumption, high output, and multiple varieties." While strengthening technology and planning management, factories have formulated specific measures and indicators such as "skillful tailoring and careful manufacturing, and making fine food from coarse grains" to save raw materials, improve product quality, and reduce consumption. The workers of Tianjin Shoe Factory, which has completed its plan every month and improved product quality month by month since the beginning of this year, are determined to carry out technical revolution, improve the degree of mechanization, strengthen enterprise management, and strive to overfulfill the July production plan by 10% in all aspects.

    The workers of Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant, which completed the second quarter plan ahead of schedule, decided to carry out a mass movement with quality as the key link and strengthening management as the focus in the third quarter, launch a technical revolution, deeply carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and achieve the goals of improving quality, reducing costs, eliminating work-related injuries, and preventing waste.

    The workers of the machinery industry system, who have made great achievements in supporting industrial and agricultural production, are also strengthening the technical rear, organizing balanced production, and are determined to produce more and better-quality machinery and a large number of spare parts to welcome the tenth anniversary of National Day.

    本报天津1日电　天津市工业战线上的广大职工，决心在第三季度继续鼓足干劲深入开展增产节约运动，千方百计地全面完成国家计划，用更大的生产成就迎接国庆十周年。
    天津市广大职工在1958年大跃进的基础上为实现1959年的继续跃进开展了以提高质量为中心的增产节约红旗竞赛运动取得了巨大成就。根据河西、河北、河东等五个区截至6月30日的统计，有二百八十多个工厂提前完成了上半年生产计划，产品的质量也有了很大的提高，钢的合格率6月份已经提高到96％。全市1至5月份试制成功的新产品达二千二百一十四种，有八百九十五种投入了生产。今年上半年，全市的产品的成本也有了降低，可比成本比去年同期降低了1.21％。广大职工在增产节约运动中涌现出了先进标兵三千多名，先进小组一千个左右。
    目前，许多工厂职工正在乘胜前进，深入地讨论第三季度计划，围绕着改进提高产品质量、增加品种、厉行节约、力争高产、提高劳动生产率，提出了许多合理化建议和技术组织措施。全市轻工业系统上半年的生产水平比去年同期提高了56.2％。现在，职工们正在继续开展“优质、低耗、高产、多品种”的竞赛运动。各工厂在加强技术和计划管理的同时，已经制订出节约原材料的“巧裁巧做、粗粮细做”等具体措施和指标来提高产品质量，降低消耗。今年以来月月完成计划的、产品质量逐月提高的天津制鞋厂职工，决心大搞技术革命，提高机械化程度，加强企业管理，力争超额10％全面完成7月份生产计划。
  提前完成第二季度计划的天津第一钢厂的职工决定在第三季度开展以质量为纲，以加强管理工作为重点，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，深入开展增产节约运动，达到提高质量，降低成本，消灭工伤事故，杜绝浪费。
    在支援工农业生产中取得很大成绩的机械工业系统的职工也正在加强技术后方，组织均衡生产，决心生产更多的、质量优良的机械和大批配件迎接国庆十周年。
