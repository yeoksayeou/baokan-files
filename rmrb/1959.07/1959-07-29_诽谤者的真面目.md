The United States Congress recently passed a joint resolution. This resolution actually authorizes the President of the United States to issue a proclamation designating the third week of July each year as "Captive Nations Week." The long list of so-called "nations enslaved by communist imperialism" includes Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the People’s Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and even many of the Soviet Union's republics.

The US Congress's resolution completely replaces truth with lies and reality with delusion. It distorts the liberation that the people of the European and Asian people's democracies gained through their struggle against imperialism and fascism, and their unwavering choice of the socialist road, as the result of the "direct and indirect aggression" of the Soviet Union. It portrays the dark past of these countries as "free" "paradises," and their glorious present as "enslaved" "hells."

But the history of socialist countries can never be reversed or distorted by a piece of absurd nonsense from the U.S. Congress. What hundreds of millions of people in these countries lost after liberation were only the chains of imperialist oppression and capitalist enslavement, and what they gained was true independence, freedom, and happiness. It is precisely because of such earth-shattering changes that they have accomplished in a short historical period what could not be completed or even dreamed of in the past centuries, and built their motherland into a thriving socialist paradise. It is precisely because of this that it has angered those Wall Street bosses and their agents. Throughout the entire post-war period, they have repeatedly used economic blockades, covert subversion, open provocations, and even military aggression to conspire to overthrow the newborn socialist countries and rebuild their imperialist rule. But history is, after all, merciless. On the Korean Peninsula, they had to retreat to the place where they originally launched the aggression, and in the streets of Budapest, their vicious claws were also severely severed. Although the US government is still spending a huge sum of $800 million annually to carry out subversive and destructive activities against the socialist camp, they can never stop the pace of 900 million people. As many socialist countries are about to celebrate the 15th anniversary of their founding, these countries are growing stronger and more consolidated, and the imperialist attempt to restore capitalist rule within them is even more remote. This shameful resolution of the US Congress was passed under such helpless but unwilling circumstances. This resolution is permeated from beginning to end with the US ruling clique's deep-seated hatred for socialist countries and all people who have gained independence and freedom.

While wantonly slandering socialist countries, the US Congress's resolution, of course, did not forget to boast about the United States itself. It shamelessly touted America's "democratic order" and "free society," and promoted America's "national unity" and "compassion" for other countries' peoples. But can this clumsy lie cover up the true face of the slanderer? Who does not know that the United States is the country where racial discrimination is the most rampant and capitalist exploitation is the most brutal? Today, within the United States, not only are nearly 20 million Black people and people of color in a humiliating and disenfranchised state of enslavement, but the vast majority of the workforce who sell their labor are actually slaves under the yoke of capitalist exploitation. America's "democracy" and "freedom" are merely the private property of a few bloated millionaires, and for the vast majority of working people, they are unattainable luxuries. On the very day that the United States began its so-called "Captive Nations Week," former U.S. Air Force Major Roberdeau Richard, who brought his wife and three children to the Soviet Union to request to become Soviet citizens, wrote in the Soviet newspaper "Pravda":
	“In America, freedom is limited. It is monopolized by the Rockefeller and Morgan groups. Real freedom is in the socialist world.” This cannot but be a strong satire on the resolution of the US Congress.

The attempt of the US Congress to dress up the United States as a sympathizer and aid provider for weak nations is also futile. Who doesn't know that the United States is the most greedy imperialist aggressor and the most vicious colonialist? Those American congressmen who are familiar with their own country's history should understand how the United States came to be today. The famous American bourgeois commentator Lippmann once wrote: "Before embarking on the study of our foreign policy, it is helpful to think about the following point, namely, that most of the land that now constitutes the continental territory of the United States originally belonged to other nations, and only became part of the United States through diplomacy and war." Of course, the American imperialists are not satisfied with North America. After World War II, through economic plunder, political infiltration, and military expansion, they extended their imperialist tentacles to all corners of the world. The United States has acted as a world policeman and has become the most ferocious enemy of national liberation movements around the world. In Asia, it forcibly occupies South Korea, replaced the French colonialists in Vietnam, and instigated and supported the armed rebellion in Indonesia. Even former US Air Force Secretary Finletter admitted: "American foreign policy toward Asia has never completely removed the shameful imprint of colonialism." In the Middle East, the United States wanted to fill the vacuum with the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and openly sent troops to invade Lebanon in 1958, using this to threaten the national revolution in Iraq. In Latin America, the United States, through various means, has successively overthrown the legitimate governments of many countries sixteen times in the past ten years. And today it is even more blatantly interfering in Cuba's internal affairs, threatening to "use force" to "drive out Fidel Castro." Are not all of these purposes to suppress the national liberation movements of these countries and continue to maintain, or re-impose, the chains of imperialist enslavement on the peoples of these countries? U.S. Labor Secretary Mitchell admitted not long ago: in the eyes of the people of underdeveloped countries, the United States "seems like a hypocrite." The joint resolution of the US Congress is a full expression of this "hypocritical" face. In fact, are not the words "imperialist enslavement," "huge empire," "direct and indirect aggression," etc., in the resolution a portrayal of the United States' own imperialist face?

The face and motives of the slanderer are difficult to conceal. The US Congress's choice to slander and smear socialist countries at this time is obviously to create obstacles to the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and the development of normal international relations, and to poison the international atmosphere.

Due to the unswerving pursuit of a peaceful foreign policy by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries and the joint efforts of peace-loving people all over the world, the imperialist "Cold War" policy is encountering increasing resistance. The holding of the Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference has given the people of all countries new hope for the approach of resolving international disputes through negotiation. Under the repeated proactive efforts of the Soviet government, cultural exchanges and mutual interactions between the Soviet Union and the United States have also made some progress.

Now, more and more Americans have broken through the propaganda fog spread by the US authorities and the US bourgeois newspapers, and have begun to understand the truth about the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and the achievements of communist construction. At the same time, their calls for the US government to lift restrictions on Soviet-American trade relations and cultural exchanges are also growing stronger. This situation and its development prospects are obviously feared by the US ruling clique. Therefore, they will not hesitate to use congressional resolutions to slander and smear the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, attempting to distort the truth about socialist countries and dilute the significant impact of socialist countries' economic construction achievements and peaceful foreign policy.

At the same time that the United States is holding its so-called "Captive Nations Week," U.S. Vice President Nixon has come to Moscow for a visit and is loudly touting the high-sounding rhetoric of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition. But how can such moving rhetoric be reconciled with the ear-piercing clamor in the US Congress's resolution? In contrast to this congressional resolution full of anti-Soviet sentiment and the fantasy of subverting socialist countries, doesn't Nixon's sweet talk seem even more hypocritical?

    诽谤者的真面目
    陈有为
    美国国会参众两院最近通过了一项联合决议。这个决议竟然授权美国总统颁布公告，规定每年7月的第三个星期为所谓“被奴役国家周”。它所罗列的一长串所谓“被共产帝国主义奴役”国家的名单中，包括波兰、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、中华人民共和国、越南民主共和国以至苏联的许多加盟共和国。
    美国国会的这个决议，完全是以谎言代替真理，以妄想代替现实的。它把欧亚人民民主国家人民经过反对帝国主义和法西斯主义的斗争而获得的解放，和他们对于社会主义道路坚定不移的选择，歪曲成为苏联的“直接和间接的侵略”的结果。它把这些国家黑暗的过去说成是“自由”的“天堂”，而把它们的光辉的现在说成是“被奴役”的“地狱”。
    但是社会主义国家的历史决不是美国国会的一纸荒唐胡言所能颠倒歪曲的。这些国家的亿万人民解放以后所失去的只是帝国主义压迫和资本主义奴役的锁链，而得到的却是真正的独立、自由和幸福。正是因为有了这样的翻天覆地的变化，它们才在短短的历史时期内完成了过去几个世纪都无法完成甚至难以梦想的事业，把自己的祖国建设成为欣欣向荣的社会主义乐园。也正是因为这样，才激怒了那些华尔街老板和他们的代理人。在整个战后时期，他们曾经一再地使用经济封锁、暗中颠覆、公开挑衅以至军事侵略的种种手段，阴谋推翻新生的社会主义国家，重建他们的帝国主义统治。但历史毕竟是无情的。在朝鲜半岛上，他们不得不退回到原来发动侵略的地方，而在布达佩斯街头，他们凶恶的魔爪也被狠狠地砍断了。尽管美国政府还在以每年八亿美元的巨款来对社会主义阵营进行颠覆破坏活动，但他们绝对不能阻止九亿人民前进的步伐。在许多社会主义国家即将欢庆建国十五周年的时候，这些国家是茁长得更加巩固强壮，而帝国主义想在它们内部复辟资本主义统治的企图也是更加渺茫了。美国国会的这个可耻决议，正是在这种无可奈何而又于心不甘的情况之下通过的。这个决议从头到尾都渗透着美国统治集团对于社会主义国家以及一切获得独立自由的人民的刻骨仇恨。
    在对社会主义国家大肆诽谤的同时，美国国会的决议当然并没有忘记为美国自己吹嘘一番。它毫不知耻地标榜美国的“民主秩序”和“自由社会”，宣扬美国的“民族团结”和对他国人民的“同情”。但是这种拙劣的谎言难道就能掩盖诽谤者自己的真面目了吗？谁不知道美国是种族歧视最猖獗，资本主义剥削最残酷的国家呢？今天在美国国内，不但近两千万的黑人和有色人种处于屈辱无权的被奴役地位，而且占人口绝大多数的劳动力出卖者实际上也不过是资本主义剥削枷锁下的奴隶。美国的“民主”和“自由”只是少数脑满肠肥的百万富翁的私有物，对于广大劳动人民说来，它们却是可望而不可得的奢侈品。就在美国开始所谓“被奴役国家周”的那一天，一个带着妻子和三个孩子到苏联请求做苏联公民的美国前空军少校里伯罗·里恰德，在苏联“真理报”上写道：
  “在美国，自由是有限的，它为洛克菲勒和摩根集团所垅断。真正的自由是在社会主义世界”。这对于美国国会的决议，不能不是一个强烈的讽刺。
    美国国会的决议要把美国装扮成弱小民族的同情者和援助者的企图也是徒然的。谁又不知道美国是最贪婪的帝国主义侵略者和最凶恶的殖民主义者呢？熟悉本国历史的那些美国议员先生们，应该明白今天的美国是怎么来的。美国著名的资产阶级评论员李普曼曾经写道：“在着手研究我国外交政策之前，想一想下面一点是有好处的，即现在构成美国大陆领土的大部分土地原来都属于其他民族的，只是由于外交和战争才成为美国的一部分”。当然，美国的帝国主义者并不以北美洲为满足。在第二次大战以后，他们通过经济掠夺、政治渗透和军事扩张的手段，把自己的帝国主义触须伸展到了世界的各个角落。美国已充当了世界宪兵的角色，成了世界各地民族解放运动最凶恶的敌人。在亚洲，它强占南朝鲜，取法国殖民者在越南的地位而代之，并且策动和支持印度尼西亚的武装叛乱。就连美国前空军部长芬勒特也承认：“美国对亚洲的外交政策始终没有完全去掉殖民主义的可耻烙印。”在中东，美国要以“艾森豪威尔主义”来填补真空，并在1958年公然举兵侵占黎巴嫩，借此威胁伊拉克的民族革命。在拉丁美洲，美国通过各种手段，曾在最近十年内先后十六次颠覆了许多国家的合法政府。而今天它更在明目张胆地干涉古巴的内政，威胁着要“采用武力”来把“菲德尔·卡斯特罗赶走”。所有这一切的目的，难道不都是为了镇压这些国家的民族解放运动，把帝国主义的奴役锁链继续保持下去，或者重新强加在这些国家的人民的身上吗？美国劳工部长密契尔不久以前承认：在不发达国家人民的心目中，美国“好像伪君子”一样。美国国会参众两院的联合决议，就是这种“伪君子”面貌的十足表现。其实，决议所说的“帝国主义奴役”，“庞大的帝国”，“直接和间接的侵略”等等字眼，不正是美国自己的帝国主义嘴脸的写照吗？
    诽谤者的面目和动机是难以掩盖的。美国国会选择目前这个时候来对社会主义国家进行诽谤污蔑，显然是为了给不同社会制度国家的和平共处和正常国际关系的发展制造障碍，为了毒化国际气氛。
    由于苏联和其他社会主义国家坚持不渝地奉行和平外交政策和全世界爱好和平人民的共同努力，帝国主义的“冷战”政策正在受到越来越大的阻力。日内瓦东西方外长会议的举行，使各国人民对以谈判解决国际争端的方针产生了新的希望。在苏联政府的一再主动努力下，苏美两国之间的文化交流和相互往来也有了一定的开展。
    现在，越来越多的美国人民已经冲破了美国官方和美国资产阶级报刊所散布的宣传迷雾，开始了解到苏联和平外交政策和共产主义建设成就的真相。与此同时，他们要求美国政府取消苏美贸易关系和文化交流限制的呼声也越来越强烈了。这种情况和它的发展前景，显然是美国统治集团所害怕的。因此，他们就不惜以国会决议来对苏联和其他社会主义国家进行诽谤污蔑，企图以此来歪曲社会主义国家的真相，冲淡社会主义国家的经济建设成就和和平外交政策的重大影响。
    就在美国举行所谓“被奴役国家周”的同时，美国副总统尼克松来到了莫斯科进行访问，并大唱其和平共处与和平竞赛的高调。但是这种动人的词令，跟美国国会决议中的刺耳的叫嚣又怎么能够协调呢？在这个充满反苏情绪和妄想颠覆社会主义国家的国会决议的对照之下，尼克松的花言巧语不是显得更加虚伪了吗？
