Hubei Takes Important Measures to Promote Industrial and Agricultural Production and Boost Material Exchange
Requires processing and ordering of daily-use light industrial and handicraft products, guaranteeing the supply of agricultural and fishery production materials, strengthening the purchase of local and special products, and combining employee and commune member holidays to restore market towns.
According to Hubei Daily News, the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce held a telephone conference of commercial bureau chiefs from all special districts, cities, and counties on the 5th of this month, and assigned the tasks for the third quarter to commercial departments throughout the province.
The conference, after comprehensively analyzing the completion of the purchase and sales plans by the province's commercial departments in the first half of the year, pointed out that following the bumper wheat harvest, early and mid-season rice will also yield a bumper harvest throughout the province, and market material exchanges will become even more vigorous. The purchase and sales tasks of the commercial departments in the second half of the year will be even more arduous. Therefore, it is required that the leading cadres and all employees of commercial departments in various localities, with ample drive, build on the victories achieved in the first half of the year, and continue to advance diligently.
The conference first required commercial departments, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, to assist all parties in ensuring the supply of raw materials for daily-use industrial products and promoting the development of light industry; to help handicraft organizations with raw materials and promote the development of handicrafts. Processing and ordering should be implemented for light industry and handicrafts, and production should be carried out according to the colors, varieties, and specifications needed by the market. Existing raw materials should be used for the most needed products, and the production of main products should be guaranteed first. For commune handicraft products, commercial departments can process and order, and handicrafts can also find their own raw materials, produce and sell their own products. If there are insufficient raw materials, commercial departments should help find substitutes.
The conference pointed out that while arranging the production of daily-use industrial products, the supply of agricultural production materials should not be ignored. Currently, pesticides and fertilizers should be quickly allocated to grassroots supply points and supply should be strengthened. The quality of locally produced chemical fertilizers should be improved and costs reduced, especially in helping communes and production teams to produce and use them themselves. At the same time, the supply of farm tools for autumn harvest and winter sowing should be strengthened to fully support the bumper harvest. As more than 100,000 fishermen in the province have returned to their teams, the task of supplying fishing supplies is very heavy. Commercial departments should do everything possible to ensure the supply of materials such as ramie, tung oil, and palm fiber, and help find substitutes for insufficient raw materials.
The conference believed that strengthening the procurement of agricultural, sideline, local and special products, and Chinese medicinal materials is also an important task in the third quarter. The key to completing the procurement task of agricultural products lies in helping communes and production teams to develop diversified operations. Therefore, commercial departments should go deep into the communes, understand their difficulties, and actively help solve them. In the procurement work, commercial departments in various localities should conscientiously implement policies, and the two-retention policy for pig procurement should be strictly honored. Other agricultural, sideline, local and special products should be priced according to quality, democratically evaluated, and encourage the production enthusiasm of communes, production teams, and commune members. Due to the expansion of urban and rural vegetable areas, in addition to doing a good job in the current supply of seeds, commercial departments should also actively strengthen the procurement, pickling, and drying of vegetables to ensure needs and strengthen reserves.
The conference also made arrangements for restoring market towns and further enlivening the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. The conference pointed out that due to the development of diversified operations by various communes and production teams, and the fact that communes have stipulated that male and female commune members have three to five days of holidays each month, commune members' household sideline occupations will have corresponding development, and the number of products on the market may increase. To adapt to this situation, various localities should strengthen the leadership of farmer service departments and exchanges to facilitate commune members' sales of sideline products; combine commune members' holidays to restore market days; central stores should hold third-category material exchange meetings regularly, preferably every half month or once a month, to promote the production of third-category materials and enliven the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.
In addition, the conference also required all commercial departments to further clear funds and commodity inventory. It is required to do a good job in clearing, handling, and establishing systems. (Attached picture)

    全面加强商业战线
    湖北采取重要措施促进工农业生产推动物资交流
    要求对日用轻工业、手工业实行加工订货，保证供应农渔业生产资料，加强土副特产品的收购并结合员社假日做好恢复集镇工作。
    据湖北日报消息　湖北省商业厅在本月5日召开的全省专、市、县商业局长电话会议上，向全省商业部门布置第三季度的工作任务。
    会议在全面分析了上半年全省商业部门完成购销计划的情况以后，接着指出继小麦丰收以后，全省早中稻又将获得丰收，市场物资交流将愈加旺盛，商业部门下半年的购销任务将更加繁重。因此要求各地商业部门的领导干部和全体职工，鼓足干劲，在上半年取得胜利的基础上，更加兢兢业业的乘胜前进。
    会议首先要求商业部门在党的各级组织的领导下，协助各方，作好日用工业品的原料供应，促进轻工业的发展；帮助手工业组织原料，促进手工业的发展。对轻工业和手工业，要实行加工订货，按市场需要的花色、品种、规格进行生产。要把现有的原料用于当前最需要的产品上去，首先要保证主要产品的生产。对于公社的手工业产品，可以通过商业上加工订货，手工业也可以自找原料，自产自销。原料不足的，商业部门应当帮助找寻代用品。
    会议指出，在安排日用工业品生产的同时，不能忽视对农业生产资料的供应工作。当前应把农药、化肥迅速拨向基层供应点，加强供应。对土化肥的生产要提高质量，降低成本，特别是要帮助公社生产队自制自用。同时要加强对秋收、冬播农具的供应，全力支持丰收。由于全省十多万渔民已经纷纷归队，渔需品的供应任务就很繁重。商业部门应该千方百计保证麻、桐油、棕片等物资的供应，不足的原料要帮助找寻代用品。
    会议认为：加强农副土特产品和中药材的采购工作，也是第三季度的一项重要任务。完成农产品的收购任务，关键在于帮助公社、生产队开展多种经营的生产。因此商业部门要深入到公社，了解他们的困难，积极帮助解决。在收购工作中，各地商业部门要认真贯彻政策，生猪收购的两留政策应该严格兑现。其它农副土特产品要实行优级优价，民主评议，鼓励公社生产队和社员的生产积极性。由于城乡蔬菜面积的扩大，商业部门除作好当前的种子供应外，还要积极加强蔬菜的收购和腌制晒干工作，保证需要，加强储备。
    会议对于恢复集镇，进一步活跃城乡物资交流也作了安排。会议指出，由于各公社、生产队多种经营的开展，各地公社又规定男女社员每月有三至五天的假日，社员家庭副业将有相应的发展，上市的产品将可能增多。为适应这种情况，各地应该加强农民服务部和交易所的领导，便利社员出售副业产品；结合社员放假恢复集日；中心商店定期召开三类物资交流会，最好每半月或一月开一次，促进三类物资生产，活跃城乡物资交流。
    此外，会议还要求各商业部门进一步清理资金和商品库存。要求做到清理好，处理好，制度建立好。（附图片）
