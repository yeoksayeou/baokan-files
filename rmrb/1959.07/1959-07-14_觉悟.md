Awakening
Worker Jin Fugen, Second Workshop, Yuci Jingwei Factory, Shanxi

    Some people are very good at talking about this and that kind of communist consciousness, but what they do doesn't quite match up to what they say. I believe that there can only be one standard for measuring the level of consciousness: "Actively do more things that are beneficial to the Party and the people. Never do anything that is harmful to the Party and the people, and wage a struggle against it."

    These last few days are crucial days for the summer harvest and planting. The Party committee of our factory called on all comrades who are healthy and don't have any particularly urgent matters to take advantage of Sunday to help in the countryside for a day. Each employee can choose any day to go, based on their own actual situation.

    In our workshop, there is a comrade I know very well who was very active in signing up to participate in weeding on June 21st. When he came back, I asked him, "How was the work in the fields? Was it bearable being in the sun?" He didn't answer right away, but after a while, he said with a smile, "To be honest, working in the fields is not as easy as using a file." After another while, he added, "There is nothing more terrible in the world than the midday sun."

    June 28th was the day to harvest wheat. I got up a little after four in the morning, washed my face, and ate breakfast. It was almost five o'clock already. At this time, the bell was already ringing, indicating that the wheat harvesters should gather. I walked to the gathering place for our workshop, and the comrade I mentioned earlier was already standing there. I said to him, "Didn't you already go weeding last time?" He whispered in my ear, "I haven't forgotten." I said again, "You've never harvested wheat before, it will be too much for you to bear. You should go back and rest!" But he said in a serious tone, "Don't you think this is a good thing?" I didn't say anything more.

    To be honest, at first, I felt sorry for him. He grew up in Shanghai and had never even touched a sickle handle since he was a child. The wheat he cut with all his might was not proportional to the effort he put in. But he was very humble, asking others, watching others, and after a short while, he was already like half a farmer. We harvested until noon. He didn't complain even once while harvesting wheat. I myself honestly admitted to complaining a few times, and there was another person behind me who complained almost every fifteen minutes, sometimes that it was too hot to bear, sometimes that it was too tiring to bear. On the way back to the factory, I walked with him at the back. I asked him, "How is it, are you feeling well?" He didn't answer, just smiled, and showed me his right hand, which had two blisters the size of soybeans, one of which had already burst, and the other was still high. We didn't talk much. I was thinking about why some people can say more than a dozen things that sound more important than harvesting wheat. But why don't these people think that if they don't harvest more wheat today, they will eat less grain in the future?

    The above two types of people clearly illustrate that people with different levels of consciousness will do different things. Because of the above reasons, later I asked him, if I write your story in the newspaper to praise you, what do you think? He was immediately surprised and said very unceremoniously, "Small things like this are simply what should be done. For the working class, this is nothing at all." I said, "Your statement is not comprehensive enough. We are not doing it for honor, but so that those who are not highly conscious will feel ashamed after seeing it, so that they will change. Isn't this a good thing?" Maybe my last sentence had an effect on him, and he agreed with my opinion, but he firmly said, "You must not name me. If you point out my name, I will beat you." I said okay, I respect your opinion. So I didn't mention his name.

    觉悟
    山西榆次经纬厂二车间工人　金福根
    有的人在口头上，很会讲这样那样的共产主义觉悟，而做起来并不像说起来那样干脆漂亮。我认为衡量觉悟高低的标准只能有一条：“对党、对人民有利的事情，积极多做些。对党、对人民有害的事情一概不做，并且展开斗争。”
    最近这几天是夏收夏种具有决定意义的几天。我们厂的党委号召凡是身体健康、没有什么特别紧急事情的同志，都能利用星期天到农村去帮忙一天。每个职工都可以根据自己实际情况任意挑选一天去。
    在我们车间里，有一个我很熟悉的同志，在6月21日去锄草时就很积极地报名参加了。回来我问他：“在田里工作怎么样，太阳晒得受得了吗？”他没有马上回答，过了一会却笑迷迷的说：“说老实话，在田里工作，不像拿锉刀那样省力。”又过一会他又加上一句“世界上再没有比中午的太阳更可怕的东西了。”
    6月28日是去割麦。我早上四点多一点就起床，洗完脸、吃过早饭，已经快五点了。这时叫子已经响了，表示割麦的人应该集合了。我走到我们车间集合的地方，我前面说过的那个同志已经在那里站好了。我对他说：“上次锄草你不是去过了吗？”他在耳面轻声的说：“我并没有忘记。”我又说：“你从来没有割过麦，累得够你受，还是回去休息吧！”他却用严肃的语气说：“你不认为这是件好事吗？”我再也没有说什么话。
    老实说，开始我很可怜他。他生长在上海，从小连镰把都没有摸过。用了吃奶的力气，割的麦并不同他所花的力气成正比。但他却很虚心，问别人，看别人，过了不多一会他已经像半个农民了。我们一直割到中午。他在割麦时并未叫过半声苦。我自己老实讲是叫过几声苦的，而我后边还有一个人更是差不多过一刻钟叫一声，一会儿热得受不了，一会儿是累得不好受。回厂时我同他一起走在后边，我问他？“怎么样，好受吗？”他没有回答，光是笑了笑，把右手伸给我看了一下，手上有两个像黄豆大的泡，一个已经破掉了，一个还是高高的。我们话说得不多，我在想为什么有的人，能说出一打以上听起来比割麦还重要的事情。但，这些人为什么不想一下，今天不多割些麦，将来会少吃一些粮呢？
    上面两种人，很明显说明了两种觉悟不同的人，会做出两种不同的事。由于上述的原因，后来我问他，如果我把你的事情，写到报纸上去，表扬你一下怎么样？他马上很惊奇，并且很不客气的说：“像我这样的小事，根本就是应该作的。对工人阶级来说，这根本算不了什么。”我说：“你这样说法不够全面。我们不是为了荣誉，而是为了能使那些觉悟不高的人，看到后感到问心有愧，使他们有所改变，这难道不是件好事吗？”可能我最后一句话对他起了作用，他也同意了我的意见，但他坚决的说：“你一定不要指名，如果指出名字，我要揍你。”我说好吧，我尊重你的意见。所以我就没有提他的名字。
