Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 13th (TASS dispatch): The Soviet Union has successfully launched another geophysical ballistic rocket, of the same type as the one launched on July 2nd.

	This rocket was launched at 4:12 AM Moscow time on July 10th, according to the scientific plan for studying the upper atmosphere.

	The two dogs carried on the rocket, along with all the instruments, returned to the ground intact. One of the dogs was "Brave," which has now flown into high altitude for the fourth time.

	The rocket had a payload of 2,200 kilograms. The plan for this experiment has been fully completed.

    苏联又成功发射一支弹道火箭
    获得了测量地球和地球大气的红外线辐射等材料
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联又成功地发射了一个地球物理弹道火箭，这个火箭和7月2日发射的那个是同一类型的。
　　这个火箭是在7月10日莫斯科时间四时十二分，根据研究大气高层的科学计划发射的。
    火箭上载有的两只狗和全部仪器都完好地返回到地面。这两只狗中，有一只是小狗“勇士”，它已经是第四次飞入高空了。
　　火箭的有效重量是两千二百公斤。　这次试验的计划已经全部完成，除7月2日所发射的火箭的研究项目外，这次还获得了测量地球和地球大气的红外线辐射的材料，对在很大区域内的云体进行了摄影，同时对大气的离子和中子构成进行了分析，还测量了静电场。
