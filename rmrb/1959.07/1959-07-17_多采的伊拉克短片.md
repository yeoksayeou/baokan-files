Colorful Iraqi Short Films

      The River of Time
    Iraq is a country with a long history and culture. Six thousand years ago, the Sumerians developed the area where the Euphrates and Tigris rivers meet, settling in the delta of the Persian Gulf. Later, the Arabs inherited and developed its economy, culture, and science and technology; they sailed across the oceans to trade with China and Europe, and brought Chinese papermaking technology back with them. The film "The River of Time" introduces the fruits of people's hard work on this land, one of the birthplaces of ancient culture, through many precious historical relics, vivid pictures, and magnificent colors, as well as the excavations of archaeologists.
    King of Arab Musical Instruments
    The Oud is an ancient Arab musical instrument. In Iraq, its elegant sound is melodious. The film vividly introduces the techniques and experience of manufacturing this national musical instrument to the audience. We can not only see the beautiful Oud, made entirely of special wood inlaid with lace decorations, but also enjoy the pleasant music played on it.
      Picking Oranges Song
    The film gives us an unusually fresh feeling. Without a single commentary, it expresses the labor and joy of the orange pickers through vivid color pictures and beautiful folk songs. The orange pickers sing:
    Be careful when picking oranges,
    Don't break the branches. ...
    The ripe oranges,
    Bring a burst of fragrance.
    Be careful when picking up the basket,
    Don't hurt the oranges. ……………
    The North is Paradise
    Iraqis praise many scenic spots such as Monsala Martin, saying: It is as beautiful as paradise all year round. This scenic film introduces the magnificent mountains, deep forests, secluded valleys, and clear streams of these places. In summer, people come here to escape the heat; in winter, this snow-covered resort is full of skiers.
    Vitality
    This color science education film introduces the blood transfusion work in Baghdad hospitals.
    In the Name of the People
    One year ago today, after the victory of the July Revolution in Iraq, the revolutionary court arrested a group of reactionary elements from the old regime who had committed serious treasonous crimes and conducted a just trial of them. The short documentary "In the Name of the People" records the actual situation of the trial, and also records the joy of the people who firmly rose up to defend the newly born republic and fight against the conspiracies of the reactionaries in order to consolidate the achievements of the revolution and celebrate the victory of the revolution.

    多采的伊拉克短片
    流波
      时代的河流
    伊拉克是一个具有悠久历史文化的国家。六千年前，苏末人开发了幼发拉底河和底格里斯河汇合的地带，在波斯湾的三角洲定居下来。后来，阿拉伯人继承和发展了她的经济、文化和科学技术；远渡重洋到中国和欧洲通商，把中国的造纸技术也带回去了。影片“时代的河流”以许多珍贵的历史文物、生动的图画和瑰丽的色彩，通过考古学者的发掘工作，介绍了人们对这块古代文化发源地之一的土地的辛勤劳动成果。
    阿拉伯乐器之王
    乌德琴是阿拉伯的古老乐器。在伊拉克，它典雅的琴声抑扬。影片以生动的手法，把制造这种民族乐器的技术和经验介绍给观众。我们不仅可以看到全部采用特殊木料镶制、花边装饰，具有颜色很美的乌德琴，还能欣赏到用它演奏的悦耳动听的乐曲。
      采橙歌
    影片给我们一种异常新鲜的感觉，它没有一句解说词，却把采橙人的劳动和欢悦心情，通过鲜明的彩色画面和优美的民间歌曲表现出来。采橙人唱着：
    采橙子可要小心啊，
    不要折断了树枝。……
    成熟了的橙子啊，
    带来了阵阵清香。
    拿起篮子可要当心啊，
    别叫橙子受了伤。……………
    北部是天堂
    伊拉克人赞赏蒙沙拉马丁等许多风景秀丽的地方说：一年四季，都像天堂一样的美丽。这部风景片介绍了这些地方壮丽的群山、深林幽谷和清澈小溪。夏天里人们在这里消暑；冬天，这片白雪皑皑的胜地，到处都是滑雪的人。
    生机
    这部彩色科教片，介绍了巴格达医院里的输血工作。
    在人民的名义下
    一年前的今天，伊拉克七月革命取得胜利以后，革命法庭逮捕了一批旧政权中犯有严重卖国罪行的反动分子，对他们进行了正义的审判。短纪录片“在人民的名义下”纪录了审讯的实况，也纪录了为巩固革命成果而坚定地起来保卫新生的共和国，反击反动派阴谋的人民庆祝革命胜利的欢欣。
