Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 28th -- The Anhui Provincial Museum recently received two volumes of Fang Wangxi's manuscripts donated by the family of the classical literature scholar Liu Wendian. These manuscripts are important materials for studying the Tongcheng School of prose.

Fang Wangxi was a native of Tongcheng, Anhui Province, a famous ancient prose writer in the early Qing Dynasty, and the founder of the Tongcheng School in the history of Chinese literature. These two volumes of manuscripts are Fang Wangxi's works from the age of seventy-four to eighty-four, totaling forty articles, thirty of which have not been published before. Both volumes of manuscripts were drafted in black ink and revised in vermilion, blue, and green ink.

The original custodian of the manuscripts, Liu Wendian, was a native of Hefei, Anhui. He served as a professor at Peking University, Tsinghua University, Anhui University, and Yunnan University. He was the author of "Collected Interpretations of Huainanzi" and "Chronology of Du Fu," among other books. After his death in Kunming last November, his family, following his will, transported fifteen cultural relics, including Fang Wangxi's manuscripts preserved during his lifetime, from Kunming back to Anhui and donated them to the government.

    刘文典家属献出方望溪珍贵手稿
    据新华社合肥28日电　安徽省博物馆最近收到古典文学家刘文典家属捐献的方望溪手稿两册。这些手稿，是研究桐城文派的重要的资料。
    方望溪是安徽桐城人，清初的著名古文家，也是我国文学史上桐城文派的始祖。这两册手稿是方望溪生前从七十四岁到八十四岁这一期间的著作，共四十篇，其中有三十篇过去没有刊行过。两册手稿都用墨笔起稿，用朱笔、蓝笔、绿笔修改。
    手稿原来的保存者刘文典，是安徽合肥人，曾任北京大学、清华大学、安徽大学、云南大学的教授，著有淮南子集解、杜甫年谱等书。去年11月在昆明逝世后，他的家属遵照遗嘱把他生前所保存的方望溪手稿等十五件文物，由昆明运回安徽，捐献给政府。
