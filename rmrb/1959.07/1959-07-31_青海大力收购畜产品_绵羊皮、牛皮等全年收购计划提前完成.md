Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 30th:  Livestock product companies in Qinghai Province are vigorously purchasing livestock products, and have now completed this year's annual purchase plans for varieties such as sheepskin, cowhide, and lambskin ahead of schedule. The purchase plans for horse mane, horse tail, wild animal skins, etc., were also overfulfilled on a monthly and quarterly basis in the first half of the year.

This year, at the beginning of the year, the Qinghai Provincial Livestock Products Company transferred more than 150 cadres and workers to form 33 working groups to go to some production teams in agricultural and pastoral areas to understand the production of livestock products, help formulate production plans, summarize and exchange various advanced experiences, and provide technical guidance. At the same time, they prepared tools such as shearing and cashmere collection for the masses. Therefore, the production of livestock products such as fur and wool generally started earlier this year than in previous years. For example, the cashmere collection work in the Huzhu Tu Autonomous County started half a month earlier than in previous years, and advanced cashmere collection experience was adopted, which increased the cashmere harvest of each goat by about 20%. Livestock product companies in various places have improved their purchasing methods to facilitate the masses as much as possible. Purchasing personnel in Zeku County went deep into the settlements of herdsmen to purchase, and by May 20, they had overfulfilled the annual plan for purchasing twelve kinds of livestock products, such as cowhide, sheepskin, and goat cashmere. Purchasing personnel in Ulan, Zeku, Delingha, Tongren, Qilian and other counties brought goods to the countryside to sell industrial products and purchase livestock products at the same time, which made it more convenient for the masses to buy and sell.

    青海大力收购畜产品
    绵羊皮、牛皮等全年收购计划提前完成
    新华社西宁30日电　青海省各地畜产公司大力收购畜产品，现在已经提前完成绵羊皮、牛皮和羔皮等品种今年全年的收购计划。马鬃、马尾、野兽皮等的收购计划，上半年也按月按季超额完成。
    今年，青海省畜产公司在年初就抽调干部、工人等一百五十多人，组成三十三个工作组，到农业区、牧业区的一些生产队去了解畜产品生产情况，帮助制订生产规划，总结和交流各种先进经验，并进行技术指导；同时，为群众准备了剪毛、抓绒等工具。因此，今年皮毛等畜产品的生产，一般比往年提早进行。如互助土族自治县今年的抓绒工作比往年提前了半个月，并且采取先进的抓绒经验，使每只山羊的羊绒收获量提高20％左右。各地畜产公司改进收购方法，尽量便利群众。泽库县的收购人员深入到牧民定居点收购，到5月20日就提前超额完成了全年收购牛皮、羊皮、山羊绒等十二种畜产品的计划。乌兰、泽库、德令哈、同仁、祁连等县的收购人员，有的带货下乡，一面销售工业品，一面收购畜产品，群众买卖都比较方便。
