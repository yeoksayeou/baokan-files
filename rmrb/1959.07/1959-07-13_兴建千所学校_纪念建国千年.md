Building a Thousand Schools to Commemorate the Millennium of National Founding
Poland, Balbala Deruzi

    Throughout the millennium of Poland's existence, the people have continuously struggled against the oppression, exploitation, and insults of the ruling class. The uprisings and rebellions of the working people in urban and rural areas often ended in failure. After a thousand years, only after the Second World War did the Polish people win a lasting victory, seize political power, and embark on establishing a just social system.

    Under these new conditions, the Polish people are commemorating the millennium of their motherland's existence. This occasion allows us to revisit the achievements of our people over the past thousand years and to unearth all constructive and progressive elements. It is important to recognize that among the achievements of the entire nation are spiritual treasures that time cannot erase.

    Throughout its history, Poland has made unwavering efforts to develop people's culture and education.

    "The level of a republic's citizens has always depended on the education of its youth." - Zamoyski, one of the most educated citizens of feudal Poland, said this centuries ago. Poland's progressive history has always been inextricably linked to the cause of people's education. Numerous facts from past centuries have demonstrated this connection. Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski, one of the great thinkers of the Renaissance who caused a sensation throughout Europe, devoted an entire volume to schools in his main work, "On Correcting the Inclinations of the Republic." He fought to ensure that teachers and their labor occupied an important position in society.

    Furthermore, one hundred and fifty years ago, the Commission of National Education (the earliest Ministry of Education in Europe) wrote the most beautiful chapter in the people's millennial history. The Commission of National Education's outline stipulated: "No city, town, or village shall be deprived of the necessary schools..." From the perspective of the time, this was undoubtedly one of the most progressive programs.

    From that time on, the struggle to establish schools and access education remained an important part of all progressive and people's liberation programs for decades. During the twenty years of capitalist Poland between the two world wars, social education experienced an exceptionally difficult period. The struggle for universal education became a slogan in the fight against capitalism and the growing fascism, and a slogan in the struggle for social liberation.

    This brief historical account is sufficient to explain why the Polish people today are commemorating the millennium of their motherland by launching the movement to build a thousand schools.

    How to commemorate the millennium of the motherland in the most appropriate and effective way, how to combine the past history with today, and how to combine historical experience with the needs of the whole people. In solving this problem, the Party put forward a slogan: to commemorate the millennium of the motherland's establishment by building a thousand schools. All the people joyfully accepted the Party's decision.

    Building a thousand schools to commemorate the millennium of the motherland is the most correct way to commemorate the people's millennial traditions, and it also conforms to the current situation of education in Poland. It meets the needs of Poland to build schools and further develop school plans.

    Over the past fifteen years, People's Poland has made very important achievements in education. Only by comparing these achievements with the legacy left by pre-war capitalist Poland can we understand their great significance.

    It is enough to cite the following facts to illustrate the problem. During the twenty years of capitalist Poland's existence, millions of school-age children were constantly unable to attend school; in some areas of the country, 50% of children could not attend school. For example, there was an average of only one seven-year school for every seventeen villages in rural areas.

    Today, the situation has changed dramatically. Primary education is now almost universal. In 1958, 98% of children aged seven to thirteen were in school. The increase in the number of primary school teachers and classrooms in the post-war period is shown in the following table:

            Unit    1938    1958    Percentage Increase
    Teachers   Persons    80,000    130,000    162.5
    Classrooms   Rooms    74,000    107,000    144.6

    Despite these undeniable achievements, Poland encountered great difficulties in education, especially in primary education.

    This difficulty is largely due to population growth. As everyone knows, due to the war and the occupation by Hitler's Germany, Poland's birth rate declined in 1941-1945. However, since 1946, Poland has been one of the countries with the highest birth rate in Europe.

    There were 387,000 babies born in 1943, 534,000 in 1946, and since 1953, the number of babies born each year has exceeded 700,000.

    Under these circumstances, the increase in the number of students in Polish schools is unprecedented in history. For example, the number of students in this academic year has increased by 315,000 compared to last year. In the next academic year, it will increase by 290,000.

    In short, today our country has 1.6 million school-age children, and in another six years, it will increase by another one million. This urgently requires ensuring that schools can accommodate this additional one million students. Specifically, in order to enable these newly added people to attend school, 27,000 classrooms are needed. And this number is still not enough.

    At the same time, 17,000 classrooms need to be replaced due to obsolescence and other reasons. Before the war, 32% of classrooms were rented houses, which were basically unsuitable for use as classrooms. This "legacy" left by capitalist Poland, coupled with the destruction during the war, has resulted in a batch of classrooms that are temporary buildings today.

    Thus, from the above facts, a conclusion can be drawn: at least 44,000 classrooms are needed in the next seven years.

    By 1965, the state will allocate 18 billion zlotys (Polish currency) to build 29,000 classrooms. The Party called on the whole people to build the remaining 15,000 classrooms. The people fully understand the significance of this call; this call closely integrates the state's advocacy with the needs of every family. The movement to build a thousand schools to commemorate the millennium of the motherland has begun. The duration of this movement is seven years, and it will cost 7-8 billion zlotys (Polish currency) to ensure that Polish children have 15,000 classrooms and Polish teachers have suitable on-campus dormitories.

    The National Unity Front's All-Poland Committee has formulated a special directive for this work, which clearly stipulates the organizational principles. The directive stipulates the most appropriate and rational way to utilize funds and social donations.

    In order to carry out this task, the People's Committee of the Public Fund for School Construction was established. The members of this committee include representatives from party, political, social, youth and cultural organizations. Local social school building fund committees are working across the country.

    At the same time, the minimum amount of public voluntary donations was also determined. The minimum amount of voluntary donations from employees is 0.5% of their monthly salary, while the donation from farmers is 2% of their annual income, and the donation from craftsmen and private small businesses is 5% of their annual income tax and transaction tax. These donations are entirely voluntary, and those who do not want to donate can choose not to. However, it is necessary to stipulate the minimum amount of donation. Because this can ensure that all measures are implemented until the final stage of the completion of a thousand schools.

    The first few months of carrying out the thousand-school movement showed the spirit of self-sacrifice of the Polish people. Employees of factories of all sizes donated a certain percentage of their wages; coal miners launched a "School Building Voluntary Sunday" movement. Those who voluntarily participated in voluntary Sundays contributed the value they created as a fund for building schools. Various fascinating literary and artistic evenings were held across the country to expand the thousand-school fund, and street donations were conducted.

    The content of public voluntary donations for school building is very rich, and the methods are increasing. For example, some brick factories donate bricks and tiles. Some design bureaus provide design materials for new school buildings. Some factories have undertaken the task of equipping the laboratories and practice factories of new schools. The youth newspaper "Youth Banner" launched a huge book donation movement. Its slogan is: "Donate one million books for a thousand schools!"

    The Polish Architectural Society held an award-winning solicitation of typical school building design proposals. The method of this solicitation stipulates that not only one, but several design proposals will be adopted to avoid the monotony of school building layouts.

    The first few months of launching the thousand-school movement proved that this movement was not only enthusiastically supported by the entire society, but also that the highest-level politicians and government officials participated in the school building movement, which created a very favorable atmosphere for the complete realization of this beautiful and beneficial measure.

    兴建千所学校　纪念建国千年
    波兰　巴尔巴拉·德鲁兹
    在波兰国家存在的一千年当中，人民不断地为反对统治阶级的压迫、剥削和侮辱而进行斗争。城乡劳动人民的暴动和起义，常常以失败告终。经过了一千年，在第二次世界大战后，波兰人民才赢得了持久的胜利，取得了政权，并着手建立公正的社会制度。
    在这种新的条件下，波兰人民在纪念祖国存在的一千周年。这个日子使人重新回顾一下我国人民在一千年间所取得的成就，并从中发掘出一切建设性的进步的东西。要知道，在全民的成就中，有的是时代不能磨灭的精神财富。
    波兰在历史上的各个时期，对于发展人民文化和人民教育作了始终不渝的努力。
      “共和国公民的水平，一向取决于对青年的教育。”——在几百年以前，封建时代波兰的最有教养的公民之一扎莫伊斯基就曾这样说过。波兰进步的历史，总是同人民的教育事业密不可分。过去的几个世纪，有许多事实证明了这种联系。文艺复兴时代轰动整个欧洲的大思想家之一安杰·弗里奇·莫杰夫斯基，在他的主要的著作“论纠正共和国的偏向”中，有专门一卷写学校。他为争取教师及其劳动在社会中占有重要地位而进行了斗争。
    再有，一百五十年以前，国民教育委员会（这是欧洲最早出现的教育部）在人民的千年史册上写下了最美好的一章。国民教育委员会大纲规定：“不准剥夺任何城市、任何地方和乡村所必需的学校……”从当时的条件看来，应该说这无疑是最进步的纲领之一。
    从那个时候起，争取建立学校和受教育的斗争，在几十年的漫长时期内，一直是一切进步的、人民解放纲领的重要部分。在两次世界大战之间存在的资本主义波兰的二十年内，社会教育经历了无比艰苦的时期。争取普遍受教育权的斗争，成了同资本主义和日益增长的法西斯主义进行斗争的一个口号，成了为争取社会解放而斗争的一个口号。
    上面这些简短的历史叙述，已经足以说明今天波兰人民以兴建千校运动来纪念祖国一千周年的根据了。
    如何以最合适最有效的方式来纪念祖国的一千周年，如何把过去的历史同今天结合起来，以及如何把历史经验同全民的需要结合起来。党在解决这个问题时提出了一个口号：以兴建一千个学校来纪念祖国建立的一千周年。全体人民欢欣鼓舞地接受了党的这个决定。
    兴建千校来纪念祖国一千周年，是纪念千年的人民传统的最正确的途径，同时这又符合今天波兰教育事业的情况。符合波兰建设学校的需要和进一步发展学校的计划。
    十五年来，人民波兰在教育事业方面取得了十分重要的成就。只要同战前资本主义波兰所留下来的遗产作一个对比，就可以理解这些成就的伟大意义了。
    只消举出下面的事实，就足够说明问题了。在资本主义波兰存在的二十年内，经常有上百万的学龄儿童不能就学；在国内的某些地区有50％的儿童不能上学。例如，在农村平均十七个村子才有一个七年制学校。
    今天的情况已经起了截然不同的变化。小学教育已经几乎完全普及了。1958年有98％的七岁到十三岁的儿童就学。战后时期小学教师和教室数量的增加，有如下表：
    单位　1938年　1958年　增长百分比教师　人　80，000　130，000　162.5教室　间　74，000　107，000　144.6
    尽管这些成就是不可否认的，然而波兰在教育事业，特别是在小学教育方面遇到了很大的困难。
    这个困难在很大程度上是由于人口的增长而造成的。大家知道，由于战争和希特勒德国的占领，波兰在1941—1945年的出生率下降了。但是，从1946年起波兰是欧洲出生率最高的一个国家。
    1943年出生的婴儿为三十八万七千，1946年为五十三万四千，而从1953年开始，每年出生的婴儿则已经超过了七十万。
    在这种情况下，波兰学校里学生人数的增加是历史上空前的。例如，本学年内学生人数比去年增加了三十一万五千人。在下一学年内，将增加二十九万人。
    总之，今天我国有学龄儿童一百六十万人，再过六年还要增加一百万人。这就迫切地需要保证使学校能容纳下这一百万名学生。具体地说，为了使这些新增加的人能够就学，就需要有二万七千间教室。而且这个数量也还是不够的。
    同时，还有一万七千间教室，由于适用以及其他原因，需要更换。战前有32％的教室是租用的房子，基本上不适于作教室用。资本主义波兰留下的这笔“遗产”，再加上战争期间的破坏，致使今天还有一批教室是临时性的建筑物。
    这样，从上述事实可以得出一个结论：在最近的七年内至少需要四万四千间教室。
    到1965年，将由国家拨出一百八十亿兹罗提（波币）修建二万九千间教室。党号召全体人民来兴建其余的一万五千间教室。人民完全理解这一号召的意义；这一号召使国家的倡导同每个家庭的需要紧密地结合起来。为纪念祖国一千周年而兴建千校的运动开始了。这个运动的期间是七年，要开支七、八十亿兹罗提（波币）的巨款，保证波兰的儿童有一万五千间教室，保证波兰教师有合适的校内宿舍。
    全国阵线全波委员会就这一工作制定了一个专门的指令，其中明确地规定了组织原则。在指令中规定了以最合适、最合理的办法来利用资金和社会捐献。
    为了执行这项任务，成立了建校公共基金人民委员会。这个委员会的成员包括党和政治、社会、青年及文化团体的代表。在全国各地则有地方上的社会建校基金委员会在进行工作。
    同时，还确定了最小限度的公众自愿捐款。职工自愿捐款的最小限额为本人一个月工资的0.5％，而农民的捐款为一年收入的2％，手工业者和私营小企业的捐款为其一年的所得税和交易税的5％。这种捐款完全是自愿的，不愿意捐者可以不捐。但是，规定捐款的最低限额是必要的。因为这可以保证全部措施贯彻到千校建成的最后时期为止。
    开展千校运动的头几个月，就显示了波兰人民的自我牺牲精神。各大小工厂的职工，都按一定的百分比从自己工资中拿出捐款来；煤矿工人发起了一个叫做建校义务星期日运动。自愿参加义务星期日者，把他们创造的价值贡献出来，作为建校的基金。全国各地为了扩大千校基金而举行了各种引人入胜的文艺晚会，进行了街头募捐。
    公众自愿捐助建校的活动内容很丰富，而且方式越来越多。例如，某些砖厂捐献砖瓦。某些设计局为新校舍提供设计资料。某些工厂承担了装备新学校实验室和实习工厂的任务。青年的报纸“青年旗帜报”则发起了一个巨大的献书运动。它的口号是：“为千校捐献百万册书！”
    波兰建筑协会举行了一个设奖征集典型校舍设计案，这次征集设计案的办法规定，不只采用一种，而采数种设计案，以避免校舍布局的千篇一律。
    开展千校运动的头几月证明，这个运动不仅受到整个社会的热烈拥护，而且最高级的政治家和政府人士也参加了建校运动，这为完全实现这一美好而有益的措施，创造了十分有利的气氛。
