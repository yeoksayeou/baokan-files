    Impressions of Warsaw
    Guan Xi

    The people of Warsaw always like to ask newly arrived foreign guests what their impressions of the city are. At first glance, this seems like a very ordinary question, and residents of any city would ask guests such a question. But when you pay a little attention, you will find that the people of Warsaw exude a sense of pride when asking this question, along with a strong belief in building a better future.

    In Warsaw, no matter which window of the hotel you look out of, no matter which road you walk on, people will always point to tall public buildings and beautiful residential areas and tell you: "This used to be ruins!"
  "This used to be ruins too!" "The German fascists even bombed the foundations here!" "This was just a wilderness before the war!" …

    At dusk, when you are walking on the Dobrowski Bridge over the Vistula River, looking west along the bridge, the entire outline of the Warsaw district is displayed in front of you. The 230-meter-high Palace of Culture and Science is the center of this city, and its spire inlaid with a red five-pointed star glitters with golden light in the sunset. On both sides of the wide boulevards stand many majestic buildings. The building of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish National Museum and the Military Museum are all on this east-west avenue. Looking to both sides of the east-west avenue, the outlines of various buildings are layered upon each other, extending along the river bank in both north and south directions, stretching to the horizon. Turning around to look east, on the high river bank, on the right are workers' residences surrounded by gardens and small wooden fences. Comrade Gomulka lives in one of these workers' residences. On the left is the circular building of the "Ten-Year Stadium" which can accommodate 100,000 spectators. Behind the stadium is a large park surrounded by green trees. In the distance, the chimneys of various factories in Warsaw's industrial district - the Praha district - are emitting green smoke.

    At dusk on the Dobrowski Bridge, life is colorful. On the dozens of meters wide bridge surface, various vehicles are speeding side by side on the central main road, and the sidewalks on both sides are crowded with people. Mothers peacefully push strollers, letting their children breathe the cool air from the river; elderly people stroll with pipes in their mouths; and couples of young men and women are leaning on the railings, gazing at the afterglow of the sunset on the river. Looking at such a majestic yet beautiful, prosperous yet peaceful scene, it is hard to imagine that this is Warsaw, which was once destroyed by German fascists.

    Fifteen years ago, when Warsaw was just liberated, 85% of the buildings were destroyed, 90% of the industry was destroyed, public utilities such as water, electricity, and transportation were completely paralyzed, and historical sites were almost completely destroyed. At that time, Warsaw's population decreased from about 1.3 million to about 150,000. The German Nazis, who created this tragedy, held up torches of evil and declared that they had removed Warsaw from the map; some Westerners also asserted that Warsaw would not recover for a hundred years.

    Only fifteen years have passed. Look at the Warsaw in front of you. It has not only restored everything of value that existed in the past from the ruins, but has also greatly expanded the area of construction, making it more prosperous, more beautiful, and more suitable for the needs of Poland's socialist construction than at any time in the seven hundred years since the city was founded.

    We once visited the three newly built residential areas of Muranow, Mokotow, and Mariensztat. These three residential areas already house more than 300,000 residents. Four- to six-story buildings form concave building complexes along the boulevards. Three sides are buildings, and the open space facing the street in the middle is a garden for children to play in. The first floor of the buildings are department stores, flower shops, coffee shops, restaurants, post offices, and barber shops. From the second floor onwards are residences. Some buildings are already inhabited, but the exterior has not yet been decorated, the walls are still showing red bricks, and some buildings have not even had the scaffolding removed. This shows that large-scale construction projects are continuing. Polish friends told us that 40,000 more houses will be built this year. By 1965, that is, when the Seven-Year Plan is completed, 283,000 new houses will be built. In Warsaw, you will feel that everything is new. But you will also see the "old", see the historical traces that have shone brilliantly on Polish culture. In fact, it is not accurate to say "old". These so-called old ones were also rebuilt according to the original appearance after the war.

    Warsaw's coat of arms - the mermaid statue holding a sword in one hand and a shield in the other - still stands proudly on the bank of the Vistula River. The Chopin statue in Lazienki Park still stands poetically next to the huge fountain. This statue is an outstanding work of art. Chopin sits solemnly next to a large tree in a storm. He is raising his right hand, which seems to have just left the piano, and is listening attentively, as if listening to the battle cries of the Polish people in the past years of suffering, and as if listening to the footsteps of the Polish people advancing bravely along the socialist road today.

    In order to realize the Seven-Year Plan proposed by the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, and in order to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the country, a wave of construction is boiling everywhere. The famous Polish automobile factory is now not only producing the well-known "Warsaw" cars, but also producing a "Mermaid" microcar based on the design of Polish designers. This car is smaller and more fuel-efficient than the "Warsaw". In order to present a gift to the 15th anniversary of the founding of the country, all the employees of the factory proposed to the state to undertake obligations, preparing to increase the production of "Warsaw" cars by 1,000 and "Mermaid" cars by 500 this year in addition to the planned number. And when welcoming the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party in January this year, the employees of this factory had already produced 173 more cars for the country.

    At a banquet held by the Polish Journalists Association, when the host asked us about our impressions of the city, we summarized our answer in eight characters: "The speed of Warsaw is well-deserved." The host said: "If we talk about the speed of Warsaw, then the first thing we should talk about is the speed of China's Great Leap Forward." We said: "First of all, it is the speed of the entire socialist camp." Everyone raised their glasses in laughter for these speeds. (Attached photo)

### 华沙印象

    华沙印象
    冠西
    华沙人总喜欢问初到的外国客人对这个城市的印象如何。乍听起来，这似乎是一个很平常的问题，任何一个城市的居民都会向客人提这样的问题。但是当你稍一留心的时候，就会发现华沙人在发出这个问题时的自豪感和对建设美好未来的坚强信念。
    在华沙，不论你从旅馆哪一个窗口望出去，不论你走在哪一条马路上，人们总会指着哪一幢幢高大的公共建筑和一片片漂亮的住宅区告诉你：“这里从前是废墟！”
  “这里从前也是废墟！”“这里从前连墙基都让德国法西斯炸去了！”“这里在战前只是一片旷野！”……
    在黄昏，当你在维斯杜拉河上多布罗斯基大桥上散步的时候，顺着桥向西看，整个华沙区的轮廓展现在你的面前。二百三十公尺高的文化科学宫，是这个城市的中心点，它的镶着红五星的塔尖，在夕阳中闪灼着金光。宽广的林荫大道两旁，耸立着许多雄伟的大楼，波兰统一工人党中央委员会大厦和波兰国家博物馆、军事博物馆，都在这条东西大道上。向东西大道的两侧望去，层层叠叠的各式楼房的轮廓，沿着河岸向南北两个方向一直延伸开去，望不到它的边际。回转身来向东看，高高的河岸上，右边是一幢幢环绕着花园和小木栅的工人住宅。哥穆尔卡同志就住在其中一幢工人住宅里。左边是可容十万观众的“十周年体育场”的环形建筑。体育场的背后是绿树环绕的大公园。远处，华沙的工业区——布拉哈区各个工厂的烟囱在喷着青烟。
    黄昏时分的多布罗斯基桥上，生活是多采的。几十公尺宽的桥面上，中央干道并排地飞驰着各式车辆，两边的便道上是熙熙攘攘的人流。母亲们安祥地推着摇篮车，让孩子呼吸河上凉爽的空气；老年人口衔着烟斗在散步；一对对青年男女，则正依着栏杆眺望河上夕阳的余辉。望着这样一片雄壮中带着秀丽，繁华中掺着宁静的景象，很难设想这就是曾被德国法西斯毁灭过的华沙。
    十五年前，当华沙刚被解放的时候，建筑物被炸毁了85％，工业被毁了90％，水电交通等公用事业完全处于瘫痪的状态，历史古迹更是几乎全被破坏。那时候华沙的人口从一百三十万左右减少到十五万左右。制造这场惨剧的德国纳粹分子，举着罪恶的火把宣称，他们已经把华沙从地图上除掉了；某些西方人士也断言华沙一百年不会恢复。
    时间只过了十五年，你看看眼前的华沙，它不仅从废墟上恢复了过去存在的一切有价值的东西，而且大大扩大了建筑的面积，使它变得比建城七百年来任何一个时期更繁荣，更美丽，更适合于波兰的社会主义建设事业的需要。
    我们曾经去摩拉诺、莫考托和玛利亚什塔得这三个新建的住宅区游览过。这三个住宅区已经住进去三十多万居民。一幢幢四层到六层的楼房，沿着林荫大道围成一块块凹形建筑群。三面是楼房，当中临街的空地是供儿童们游戏的花园。楼房的第一层是百货商店、鲜花店、咖啡店、餐室、邮局和理发店。从第二层开始就是住宅。有些楼房里面已经住了人，但是外表还没有修饰，墙壁还露着红砖，有一些楼房则连脚手架还没有拆掉。这说明大规模的建筑工程正在继续进行。波兰朋友告诉我们，今年将再建筑四万所房屋。到1965年，也就是到七年计划完成时，将新建二十八万三千所房屋。在华沙，你会感觉到一切都是新的。但是你也会看到“旧的”，看到那些在波兰文化上放过灿烂光辉的历史陈迹。其实说“旧的”并不确切。这些所谓旧的，也是战后按原样重建的。
    华沙的城徽——一手持剑、一手持盾的美人鱼雕像，依旧傲然耸立在维斯杜拉河河畔。亘建卡公园的萧邦铜像，依然诗意地立在巨大的喷泉旁边。这座铜像是一件杰出的艺术作品。萧邦庄严地坐在一棵暴风中的大树旁边。他举着似乎刚刚离开钢琴的右手正在侧耳倾听，像是倾听着波兰人民在过去的苦难岁月中发出的战斗呼号，又像是在倾听着今天波兰人民沿着社会主义大道奋勇前进的脚步声。
    为了实现波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会所提出的七年计划，和为了庆祝建国十五周年，到处沸腾着建设的热潮。著名的波兰汽车制造厂，现在不光是生产为人们所熟知的“华沙牌”小汽车，而且根据波兰设计师的设计，在生产一种“美人鱼牌”微型汽车。这种汽车比“华沙牌”更小、更省油。为了向建国十五周年献礼，全厂职工向国家提出承担义务，准备今年在计划数外增产“华沙牌”一千辆，“美人鱼牌”五百辆。而在今年一月迎接波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会时，这个厂的职工已为国家多生产了一百七十三辆汽车。
    在波兰记者协会举行的宴会上，当主人问及我们对这个城市的印象时，我们归纳了八个字作为回答：“华沙速度，名不虚传”。主人说：“如果谈到华沙速度，那么首先应当是中国大跃进的速度。”我们说：“首先是整个社会主义阵营的速度。”大家在一片欢笑声中，为这些速度举杯。（附图片）
