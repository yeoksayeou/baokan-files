    Finding Ways for Japanese Economic Expansion
    Kishi Nobusuke Repeatedly Rebuffed in Western Europe
    (Our dispatch) Tokyo—Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, who is currently visiting Western Europe, has concluded his meetings with the heads of government of Britain, West Germany, Austria, and Italy. Kishi's plans to increase export trade and economic expansion have repeatedly hit snags.
    Kishi's current overseas visit, which began on July 11, will last for a month. The countries he plans to visit include Britain, West Germany, Italy, Austria, France, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Mexico. According to Japanese newspapers, the purpose of his visit is to ease the contradictions between Japan and Western European countries, particularly Britain, in the competition for markets, and to find ways to strengthen the collusion between Japanese monopoly capital and Western European monopoly capital, in order to facilitate Japan's economic expansion into Southeast Asia and other regions.
    At a press conference on the eve of his departure, Kishi said that he would focus on Britain during his visit to Europe. He said that although the relationship between Britain and Japan is historically very deep, the two countries' interests in Asia often conflict. Unnecessary friction caused by economic competition between Britain and Japan is not good. However, the result of Kishi's visit to London was not pleasant. The joint communiqué issued by both sides showed that Kishi failed to get Britain to make concessions on substantive issues such as the cancellation of discriminatory trade treatment against Japan. The communiqué made no mention of the issue of eliminating competition between the two countries in the Southeast Asian market, which Kishi repeatedly emphasized.
    After a two-day visit to Bonn, Kishi issued a communiqué on the 17th. Adenauer supported Kishi's position of reviving militarism, and Kishi also supported Adenauer's position of "reunifying Germany." However, when it came to their own vested interests, they refused to give way to each other. One of the main purposes of Kishi's visit to Bonn was to discuss the issue of Japan's expanding exports to West Germany. Currently, Japan's exports to West Germany are only half of its imports from West Germany. However, the communiqué did not state what results were achieved in this issue during the talks between the two sides.
    During his visit to Austria, Kishi focused on discussing the issue of granting Japan most-favored-nation treatment in trade with Austrian Prime Minister Raab. However, the joint communiqué issued by both sides on the 18th only stated that Prime Minister Raab expressed that Austria was studying this issue with understanding.
    Before arriving in Rome, Kishi clearly stated that he hoped to discuss with Italian Prime Minister Segni and others how to avoid conflicts between Japan and Italy in the economic interests of Middle Eastern oil. Kishi also asked Italy to grant Japan most-favored-nation treatment in trade. According to news from Rome, the Italian Prime Minister said that Italy could not grant Japan this treatment because Italy participated in the "European Common Market."
    The communiqué issued by both sides on the 21st also only stated vaguely that "Italy and Japan agreed to develop their friendly relations in all aspects," without any specific content.
    Kishi left Rome for Paris on the afternoon of the 21st and will then go to Brazil and other Central and South American countries. According to Kishi himself, the purpose of his visit to Central and South American countries is mainly to discuss issues such as immigration, trade, and "economic cooperation."

    为日本经济扩张找门路
    岸信介在西欧一再碰壁
    本报讯　正在西欧进行访问的日本首相岸信介，已经结束了他同英国、西德、奥地利和意大利政府首脑的会谈。岸信介争取增加出口贸易和经济扩张的计划，一再碰了钉子。
    岸信介这次出国访问，从7月11日起为期一个月。他要访问的国家有英国、西德、意大利、奥地利、法国、巴西、阿根廷、智利、秘鲁和墨西哥等。据日本报刊透露，他这次访问的目的，是为了缓和日本同西欧国家，特别是同英国争夺市场的矛盾，并且设法加强日本垄断资本同西欧垄断资本的勾结，以利于日本向东南亚等地区的经济扩张。
    岸信介在出国前夕的一次记者招待会上说，他在欧洲访问时将把重点放在英国。他说，虽然日英两国的关系在历史上是非常深的，然而两国在亚洲的利害也经常发生矛盾。日英两国因进行经济竞争而引起的不必要的摩擦是不好的。但岸信介访问伦敦的结果并不美妙，双方发表的联合公报表明，在要求英国取消对日本的贸易差别待遇等实质性问题方面，岸信介未能使英国作出让步。公报对岸信介多次强调的关于消除两国在东南亚市场上的竞争问题，只字未提。
    岸信介在波恩进行两天访问后，在17日发表了公报。阿登纳支持岸信介的复活军国主义的立场，而岸信介也支持阿登纳的“重新统一德国”的立场。但是，牵涉到他们的切身利害时却又互不相让。岸信介这次到波恩的主要目的之一，是想商谈日本扩大向西德出口问题。目前日本向西德的出口额只及从西德进口额的一半。但是，公报没有说明双方会谈时在这个问题上获得了什么结果。
    岸信介在奥地利进行访问期间，着重同奥地利总理拉布商谈在贸易上给予日本最惠国待遇问题。但是18日双方的联合公报只说，拉布总理表示奥地利正以理解的态度研究这个问题。
    岸信介在到罗马之前明白地表示，他希望同意大利总理塞尼等人会谈如何避免日本同意大利在中东石油方面的经济利益的冲突，岸信介还要求意大利在贸易上给予日本最惠国待遇。据来自罗马的消息，意大利总理说，意大利无法给予日本这种待遇，因为意大利参加了“欧洲共同市场”。
    双方在21日发表的公报，也只空洞地表示“意大利和日本一致同意发展它们在一切方面的友好关系”，而没有任何具体的内容。
    岸信介21日下午从罗马前往巴黎访问，之后将去巴西等中南美国家。据岸信介自己说，他到中南美国家访问的目的，主要是商谈移民、贸易和“经济合作”等问题。
