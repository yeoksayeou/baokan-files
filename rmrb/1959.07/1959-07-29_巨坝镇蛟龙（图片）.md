    Jiao Long of Juba Town
    Since the beginning of this year's flood season, the Sanmenxia Water Control Project has played a role in flood control. In mid-to-late July, when floods of over 10,000 cubic meters per second passed through Sanmenxia, the reservoir area retained a maximum flood volume of over 200 million cubic meters, cutting off approximately half of the total flood volume.
    On the construction site, the temporary water-retaining structure for maintaining the dam construction – the cofferdam – was more than eight meters higher than the maximum flood peak, like a copper wall and iron barrier controlling the torrent outside the cofferdam, ensuring the normal construction of the dam. The builders sang heroically: "Sweat flows, the dam grows, the workers feel happy. In order to complete the hub station as soon as possible, we are not afraid of heavy rain, not afraid of sweat soaking our clothes; we race against time, we fight for every second, we want to do a good job for the 80 million people downstream."
    (1) The roaring flood flows down from under the spillway's comb teeth according to people's will.
    (2) The builders are pouring the last cubic meter of the dam's elevation of 310 meters above sea level.
    (3) In order to ensure the quality of the project, members of various survey teams are active on the construction site all day long. This is Hao Cuiying, a surveyor from the Second Bureau's survey team, measuring the dam's abutment line.

    巨坝镇蛟龙
    三门峡水利枢纽工程，今年汛期以来已发挥了部分拦洪的作用。7月中下旬上万秒立方米的洪峰通过三门峡时，库区拦蓄的洪水量最多时达两亿立方米以上，砍掉洪峰总水量约一半。
    工地上，由于维护大坝施工的临时性挡水建筑物——围堰高出最大洪峰八米多，像座铜墙铁壁似的把激流控制在围堰之外，保证了大坝照常施工。建设者们以英雄的姿态豪迈地唱道：“汗水淌，大坝长，工人心里多舒畅。为了早日建成枢纽站，那怕大雨淋，那怕汗水湿衣裳；抢时间，争分秒，要为下游八千万人民立功劳。”
    （1）咆哮的洪水按照人们的意志，从溢洪部梳齿下泄。

    （3）为确保工程质量，各个测量队的队员终日活跃在工地上。这是二分局测量队的测量员郝翠英在测大坝边墩线。
