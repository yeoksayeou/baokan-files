The French materialists made outstanding contributions to the history of human thought. In the struggle against the feudal system, and in the struggle against religious theology and idealism, they developed the theories of atheism and materialism, which were then inherited by utopian socialism. However, for a long time, bourgeois philosophers have always tried to erase their achievements. In their histories of philosophy, the names and theories of French materialists are rarely mentioned, and even when they are, they are distorted beyond recognition. It is only under socialist conditions that the French materialists have been restored to their due honor. Similarly, in our country, it is only after liberation that French materialists have been valued, and the publication of their works and the study of their theories have begun.

Among the important philosophical works of French materialists that have been published are "Selected Philosophical Works of Diderot" and La Mettrie's "Man a Machine." "Selected Philosophical Works of Diderot" collects eight works of varying lengths by Diderot. The ideas in some of Diderot's important works—such as "Letter on the Blind for the Use of Those Who See," "Systematic Refutation of Helvétius's 'De l'Esprit'," and "Physiological Foundations"—are not included in this collection. Therefore, this selection cannot be said to be a comprehensive introduction to Diderot's philosophical thought. However, for the vast number of readers in our country, this selection is still very useful. Through the selection, we can still see many brilliant achievements of Diderot as an outstanding materialist.

Diderot was initially a Deist (see "Philosophical Thoughts" in this book), and did not yet deny the existence of God. But at that time, he was not a staunch theist either. On the contrary, for him, Deism was merely a convenient path to get rid of religious theology. Therefore, when we open "Interpretation of Nature," we can find that he has already begun to embark on the path of an atheist. From then on, he went straight ahead and developed many profound materialist ideas.

Diderot unhesitatingly affirmed that there is only one entity in the universe, namely the entity of matter. To imagine a so-called entity that transcends matter is unfounded and merely a hypothesis that creates confusion. He said that matter is not abstract, but can be perceived by our senses. All material things are composed of the smallest particles—molecules (or elements). This clearly shows that he inherited the materialist tradition of the ancient atomists. But he greatly advanced the ideas of atomism. First, on the question of whether there is a limit to the division of matter, from Democritus to Gassendi, it was believed that the atom was the ultimate limit of division and could not be divided further. Diderot also affirmed this point: the molecule is the limit of the natural division of material things. But he made a reservation, saying that due to the development of technology, artificial division may go further than natural division. This is a very important guess, and he approached the view that matter can be infinitely divided. Second, from Democritus to Gassendi, it was believed that the difference between atoms lies only in weight, size, and shape. Diderot, however, believed that not only that, but the main point is that all molecules are qualitatively different; the diversity of phenomena in the objective world originates from the diversity of the qualities of matter; if we think that all molecules are homogeneous, it is tantamount to saying that we want to paint a colorful picture with the same color, which is unimaginable. In this way, Diderot developed and enriched the important principle that the unity of the world lies in its materiality.

At the same time, in the struggle against theology and dualism, he developed the principle that motion is the nature of matter. The relationship between matter and motion is a problem that has not been solved for a long time, and they are often examined as opposites. Idealism and theology often use this point to prove the existence of God: matter is passive, and it is God who drives the world. Diderot pointed out that it is absurd to place matter and motion in opposition; to imagine that matter is static and to try to find the source of motion outside of matter is a terrible mistake. Motion is the nature of matter. "A molecule that possesses a property suited to its nature is itself a force. It acts on another molecule, and the other molecule also acts on it." ("Philosophical Principles Concerning Matter and Motion") Just as matter is eternal and indestructible, so is motion eternal and indestructible. Therefore, Diderot's theory logically contains the following conclusion: matter without motion and motion without matter are both impossible.

However, Diderot's outstanding achievement on the question of the motion of matter lies in the fact that he was the first to explore the relationship between motion and stillness in a rather correct way. He said that motion is absolute, and is as real as time and space; stillness is relative, and absolute stillness is merely an empty abstraction that does not exist in nature. He gave an example: a ship in a storm is naturally in constant turmoil, and the molecules that make up the ship and the various objects on board are also in constant agitation, so, on the whole, they are in absolute motion. However, if we refer to the relationship of a certain object in the ship to other objects, then they are in relative stillness. In this way, Diderot guessed at the dialectic of motion and stillness. However, due to his metaphysical limitations, he was not able to scientifically summarize this dialectical relationship.

In order to oppose idealism and dualism, Diderot argued in detail that thinking is the product of the development of matter, and is an attribute of the human brain. This principle was especially valued by Lenin, and these materials were cited in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism." La Mettrie had already proposed that thinking is a characteristic of the human brain, but he did not discuss how the human brain acquired this attribute. Diderot was the first to answer this question. In opposing the theological incompleteness of Maupertuis, he pointed out that matter by its nature possesses a kind of dull sensitivity. This sensitivity is "a thousand times less than the sensitivity of the animal closest to dead matter." But as long as the appropriate conditions are met, it will develop, and this dull sensitivity will transition to active sensitivity. He saw this as the transition from the inorganic world to the organic world. Of course, the distance from the emergence of the organic world to the emergence of the thinking person is still very far, but he believed that this distance (difficulty) is much smaller than the distance from the inorganic world to the organic world. And since material factors can explain the transition from the inorganic world to the organic world, they can naturally also explain the transition from lower organisms to the thinking person. So we don't need to assume a God simply because there are still difficulties in explaining this problem in detail. Starting from this, he severely refuted Berkeley's subjective idealism and Descartes' dualism ("Conversation between D'Alembert and Diderot").

Here, we find that Diderot's ideas about development are very clear. In "D'Alembert's Dream," he drew a universal and clear conclusion. He said: "Everything changes, everything is in transition, only the whole is unchanging." How dialectical and pertinent this is! This kind of thinking can be found in almost every article in this collection. Therefore, when Engels talked about the dialectical thinking of the 18th-century philosophers, he mentioned him and cited his "Rameau's Nephew" as an example. In "Rameau's Nephew," starting from the bourgeois "theory of human nature"—which is opposed to the asceticism of the Middle Ages—he reached the idea of opposites complementing each other. He said: human nature has good and bad aspects, but we cannot say that either aspect must be forbidden. A great character is always created by the natural balance between some opposite qualities. Nothing is absolutely perfect; if everything is perfect, then there is nothing perfect. Not only for the objective world, Diderot grasped many dialectical ideas, but also for the subjective world, he mentioned some dialectical views. The most typical of these is what is mentioned in "Interpretation of Nature": all human cognitive activity "is reduced to going from sensation back to thought, and from thought back to sensation." This is a guess about the dialectical relationship between the two stages of cognition—perceptual knowledge and rational knowledge. ... Therefore, the idea of dialectics is another important contribution of Diderot.

Speaking of which, we already have enough reason to say that Diderot's philosophical thought is very rich, and it is a treasure worth continuing to explore for us. The publication of the already published "Selected Philosophical Works of Diderot" can probably be said to mark the beginning of this work.

Of course, Diderot's materialism, generally speaking, has not completely broken through the limitations of metaphysical materialism. He affirmed that the world is material, but he did not understand how to philosophically define the meaning of matter. He did not understand matter as "that which, acting upon our sense-organs, produces sensation, i.e., objective reality existing independently of our mind" (Lenin); but, like all previous metaphysical materialists, he understood matter from the structural aspect of matter. He affirmed that thinking is the product of matter, but he did not understand the role of social practice in the emergence and development of thinking, as if thinking is merely a product of nature. He affirmed that human knowledge is to reflect objective reality, but he thought that abstract concepts are merely abbreviated symbols for similar things, and do not have similar objects like sensory experiences. ...

But despite this, his writings are still worth studying.

### 法国唯物主义思想的光辉——介绍“狄德罗哲学选集”

    法国唯物主义思想的光辉
    ——介绍“狄德罗哲学选集”
    朱德生
    法国唯物主义者在人类思想发展史上有着突出的贡献。他们在反对农奴制度的斗争中，在反对宗教神学和唯心主义的斗争中，发展了无神论和唯物主义的理论，而这一理论又为空想社会主义所继承。但是，长期以来，资产阶级的哲学家们，总想抹杀他们的成就，在他们的哲学史中，很少提到法国唯物主义者的名字和理论，即使有一点，也是曲解得面目全非了。只是在社会主义条件下，才恢复了法国唯物主义者们的应有的荣誉。同样，在我国也只是在解放后，法国唯物主义者才受到了重视，开始在出版他们的著作，研究他们的理论。
    在已经出版的法国唯物主义者的重要哲学著作中，有“狄德罗哲学选集”、拉·梅特利的“人是机器”。“狄德罗哲学选集”收集了狄德罗的大小八篇作品。狄德罗的某些重要著作——如“为告诫睁眼人而谈盲人的信”、“对爱尔维修‘论人’一书的系统反驳”、“生理学基础”等等——中的思想，本集没有选入。因此，这本选集还不能说是对狄德罗哲学思想的全面的介绍。但是对于我国的广大读者来说，这本选集仍然是十分有用的，通过选集，我们还是能够看到狄德罗作为一个杰出的唯物主义者的许多光辉成就。
    狄德罗在早期是一个自然神论者（见本书“哲学思想录”），还没有否定上帝的存在。但在当时，他也不是一个坚定的有神论者，相反，对于他来说，自然神论不过是为摆脱宗教神学而铺设的方便道路而已。所以，在我们翻开“对自然的解释”时，就能发现他已经开始走上无神论者的道路了。从此以后，他就一往直前，发挥了很多深刻的唯物主义思想。
    狄德罗毫不犹豫地肯定了宇宙间只有一个实体，即物质的实体。设想所谓超越物质的实体，是没有根据的，只是一种制造混乱的假设。他说：物质并不是抽象的，而是我们的感官能够感知得到的。一切物质的东西都是由一种最小的微粒——分子（或称元素）所组成的。这里清楚地表明他继承了古代原子论者的唯物主义传统。但是他把原子论的思想大大地向前发展了。首先，在物质的分割有没有限度的问题上，从德谟克里特到伽桑狄，都认为原子就是分割的最后限度了，不能再分割了。狄德罗也肯定了这点：分子是物质的东西的自然分割的限度。但是他却作了一点保留，说由于技术的发展，也可能人为的分割将比自然的分割更进一步。这是一个十分重要的猜测，他走近了物质可以无限分割的观点。其次，从德谟克利特到伽桑狄都认为：原子的不同，只在于重量、大小、形态而已。而狄德罗则认为：不仅如此，主要的还在于所有的分子在质上都是各不相同的；客观世界现象的多样性，根源于物质的质的多样性；如果认为所有的分子都是同质的，那就等于说要用同一种颜色去画出五颜六色的画面，这是不能想像的。这样狄德罗就发展和丰富了世界的统一性在于它的物质性这一重要的原理。
    同时，在反对神学和二元论的斗争中，他又发挥了运动是物质的本性这一原理。物质和运动的关系问题是长期没有解决的问题，它们经常是被放在对立的地位来考察的。唯心主义和神学经常利用这点来证明上帝的存在：物质是被动的，推动这个世界的是上帝。而狄德罗则指出：把物质和运动置于对立的地位是荒谬的；设想物质是静止的，并企图到物质以外去寻找运动的源泉，是一个可怕的错误。运动是物质的本性。“那秉有一种适合其本性的性质的分子，本身就是一种活动力。它作用于另一个分子，另一个分子也作用于它。”（“关于物质和运动的哲学原理”）正如物质是永恒的、不灭的，运动也是永恒的、不灭的。所以在狄德罗的理论中，已逻辑地包含有如下的结论：没有运动的物质和没有物质的运动，都是不可能的。
    不过，在关于物质运动的问题上，狄德罗的特出的成就还在于他第一个颇为正确地探讨了运动和静止的关系。他说：运动是绝对的，和时间、空间一样是实在的；静止是相对的，绝对的静止只是一个空洞的抽象，在自然界中是不存在的。他举了一个例：一只处在暴风雨中的船只，自然全船都在动荡不定中，而且组成这只船和船上的各种物体的分子，也在永不停止的激动着，所以，整个说来，它们是处在绝对的运动中的。但是，如果指船中的某一物体对其他物体的关系来说，则它们又处在相对的静止中。这样，狄德罗就猜测到了运动和静止的辩证法。不过由于他的形而上学的局限性，还没有能够科学地把这一辩证关系概括出来。
    为了反对唯心主义和二元论，狄德罗详细地论证了思惟是物质发展的产物，是人脑的属性。这一原理受到了列宁的特别重视，并在“唯物主义与经验批判主义”中援引了这些材料。思惟是人脑的特性这一点，拉·梅特利就已经提出过了，但是他没有讨论人脑如何获得了这一属性。狄德罗才第一次回答了这个问题。他在反对莫伯都依的神学的不彻底性时，指出了物质按其本性来说，就具有一种迟钝的感受性。这种感受性，比之“最接近死物质的动物的感受性，还要小一千倍”。不过只要具备了适宜的条件，它就会发展起来，这种迟钝的感受性就会向活跃的感受性过渡。他就是由无机界向有机界的过渡。当然从有机界的出现到能思想的人的出现，距离还很遥远，不过他以为这段距离（困难）比之从无机界到有机界是要小得多了。而且物质的因素既然能说明从无机界到有机界的过渡，自然也能说明由低级生物到能思想的人的过渡。所以我们根本用不着因为要详细说明这一问题还有困难，而去假设一个上帝。由此出发，他严厉的驳斥了贝克莱的主观唯心论和笛卡儿的二元论（“达朗贝和狄德罗的谈话”）。
    在这里，我们发现狄德罗关于发展的思想是十分明确了。在“达朗贝的梦”中，他引伸出了普遍和明确的结论。他说：“一切都在变，一切都在过渡，只有全体是不变的。”这是多么辩证而中肯啊！这种思想，差不多在本集的每一篇文章中都能找到。所以恩格斯在谈到十八世纪哲学家们的辩证思惟的时候，提到了他，并且举出了他的
  “拉摩的侄儿”作为例子。在“拉摩的侄儿”中，他从资产阶级的“人性论”——这是和中世纪的禁欲主义相对立的——出发，达到了相反相成的思想。他说：人的自然本性，有好的，也有坏的，但是对那一方面我们也不能说：这是必须被禁止的。一个伟大的性格，总是由好些相反的性质之间的自然平衡所造成的。没有什么是绝对完美的；如果一切都是完美的，那末也就没有任何完美的东西了。不仅对于客观世界，狄德罗把握到了不少辩证的思想，对于主观世界，他也提到了一些辩证的看法。其中最典型的要算是“对自然的解释”中所提到的：人的全部认识活动“都归结到从感觉回到思考，又从思考回到感觉”。这是对于认识的两个阶段——感性认识和理性认识——的辩证关系的一次猜测。……所以辩证法的思想，是狄德罗的又一个重要的贡献。
    说到这里，我们已经有足够的理由说：狄德罗的哲学思想是十分丰富的，它对于我们是一个值得继续发掘的宝藏。已经出版的“狄德罗哲学选集”的出版，大概可以说，就标志这项工作的开端。
    当然，狄德罗的唯物主义，总的说来，还没有完全突破形而上学的唯物主义的局限性。他肯定了世界是物质的，但是他还不明白应当怎样从哲学上规定物质的含义。他不是把物质了解为“作用于我们的感官而引起我们感觉的东西，即我们感觉到的客观实在，等等”（列宁）；而正和以前所有的形而上学唯物主义者一样，从物质的结构方面来了解物质。他肯定了思惟是物质的产物，但是他却不了解社会实践在思惟的发生、发展中的作用，似乎思惟只是自然的产物。他肯定了人的认识是要反映客观实在，但是他却以为抽象概念只是对于同类事物的一个省略符号而已，不像感觉经验那样，有它类似的对象。……
    但是尽管如此，他的著作仍然值得我们研究。
