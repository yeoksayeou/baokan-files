    Xishuangbanna Harvests Cotton
    (Reported by this newspaper) The first season of cotton in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, Yunnan Province, has yielded a bumper harvest. Dai women in the flatlands on both sides of the Lancang River are braving the continuous rain to rush the harvest. The more than 5,000 mu of winter cotton planted last November is expected to be harvested by the end of the month. They are also preserving the cotton roots, carrying out mid-season cultivation, and applying fertilizer to harvest a second season of cotton in October.
    The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture is warm and evergreen year-round, with 200,000 mu of fertile land in fourteen flatlands throughout the prefecture suitable for planting double-season and triple-season cotton, or two crops of cotton and rice per year. However, before liberation, the Dai farmers here rarely grew cotton. Only a few villages near the foothills burned down forests on the hillsides, poked holes with wooden sticks to scatter cotton seeds, and the yield was very low, sometimes not even enough to recover the seeds. The cotton used by the Dai people mostly relied on supplies from other places.
    In the past few years, the Party and government leading organs of Xishuangbanna have repeatedly organized farms and key agricultural cooperatives to trial-plant cotton, proving that these areas can implement a two-crop rotation system of cotton and rice. Since last winter, the local Party and government have actively led Dai farmers to plant cotton in the dam areas, and adopted methods such as running training classes, organizing visits to other places, and holding on-site meetings to widely impart advanced cotton planting experience to farmers. At the same time, a large number of improved varieties and pesticides were transported from the mainland to ensure this year's bumper cotton harvest.

    西双版纳收棉花
    本报讯　云南省西双版纳傣族地区的第一季棉花获得丰收。澜沧江两岸平坝里的傣族妇女正冒着霪雨突击抢收，五千多亩去年11月播种的冬季棉，预计月底就可以收完。她们还给棉花蓄根、中耕和施肥，以便到10月份再收第二季棉花。
    西双版纳傣族自治州四季温暖，全年常青，全州有十四个平坝二十万亩膏腴土地可以种双季和三季棉花，或棉稻一年两熟。但在解放前，这里的傣族农民很少种棉花，只有个别靠近山脚的村寨，在山坡上烧毁森林之后，用木棍戳洞撒上棉种，产量很低，有时连种籽都收不回来；傣族人民所用的棉花，大都依靠外地供应。
    西双版纳党政领导机关，几年来曾多次组织农场和重点农业社试种棉花，证明这些地区可以实行棉稻两熟的轮作制度。去冬以来，当地党政就积极领导傣族农民在坝区种棉，并采取开办训练班、组织到外地参观和召开现场会议等方法，向农民广泛传授植棉先进经验；同时从内地运来大批良种和农药，保证了今年棉花丰收。
