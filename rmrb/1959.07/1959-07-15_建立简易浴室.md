    Building Simple Bathrooms
    More than 3,000 public canteens in the People's Communes of Linxiang County, Hunan Province, have recently established simple bathrooms, including 230 simple shower rooms. After returning from work, the commune members feel refreshed and comfortable after taking a bath in the bathroom. The opening of the bathrooms has been very popular among the commune members.
    These simple bathrooms were first established in the Binhu Brigade of the Yunxi Commune and the Longyuan Brigade of the Yanglousi Commune. They were all located near the canteens and converted from old houses. Peng Bingding, the Party Branch Secretary of the Longyuan Brigade of the Yanglousi Commune, in order to allow the commune members to take a comfortable bath and quickly eliminate fatigue after intense labor, discussed with Lu Changren, the branch secretary of the Sihe Production Team, and four other cadres, and set up simple bathrooms for men and women near the canteen. The bathroom was equipped with several bathtubs with wooden plugs. Cold and hot water were piped in from the canteen through bamboo pipes. After the bath, the wooden plugs were pulled out, and the sewage flowed into the sewage pool. After completion, the commune members applauded and praised it. Soon, all 26 canteens in the brigade followed suit, setting up a total of 180 bathtubs. Then, Long Guangyu, the Party Branch Secretary of the Dongfeng Production Team of the Yunxi Commune, designed a simple shower room together with the commune members, which was also very popular among the commune members. Therefore, the Linxiang County Party Committee held on-site meetings in these two places respectively. Soon, this simple bathroom was widely promoted in various communes throughout the county.

    建立简易浴室
    湖南临湘县各人民公社的三千多个公共食堂，最近普遍建立了简易浴室，其中有二百三十个是简易淋浴室。社员们劳动归来，到浴室里洗个澡，便觉得混身轻快舒畅。浴室开办以来，很受社员欢迎。
    这种简易浴室，开始是在云溪公社滨湖大队和羊楼司公社龙沅大队办起来的，都设在食堂附近，利用旧屋改建的。羊楼司公社龙沅大队党总支书记彭丙丁，为了让社员在紧张的劳动以后，能舒舒服服洗个澡，快点消除疲劳，就同四合生产队的支部书记鲁昌仁等四个干部研究，在食堂附近设置了男女简易浴室。浴室里面装上几个带有木塞的洗澡盆，从食堂用竹管通进冷水和热水来，洗完澡，拔开木塞，污水就流入污水池。建成后，社员个个都拍手叫好。不久，全大队二十六个食堂都跟着这样做了，共设置了一百八十个澡盆。接着云溪公社东风生产队党支部书记龙光裕，跟社员们共同设计了一个简易淋浴室，也很受社员欢迎。于是，临湘县委就分别在这两个地方召开现场会议。不久，这种简易浴室，就在全县各公社中普遍推广起来。
