Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 19th: The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the fifth anniversary of the Geneva Accords, calling on all Vietnamese people to strengthen unity and persevere in the struggle to reunify the country on the basis of independence and democracy, and to complete the cause of national liberation throughout the country.

The statement, published today in Hanoi newspapers, pointed out that the decision made by the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council to designate July 20, 1959, as "Vietnam Day" demonstrates the will of the people of Asian and African countries to resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism, oppose war, demand the implementation of the Geneva Accords, and achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam on the basis of independence and democracy. The statement said that the entire Vietnamese people express their deep gratitude for the warm support of the people of Asian and African countries, the fraternal people of socialist countries, and peace-loving people all over the world.

The statement, in reviewing the implementation of the Geneva Accords over the past five years, pointed out that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made unremitting efforts to realize the Geneva Accords during this period; however, on the other hand, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have tried every possible means to undermine the Geneva Accords, with the result that Vietnam has not yet been able to achieve reunification, and the southern half of Vietnam is still under the rule of imperialism and feudalism.

The statement then condemned the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in undermining the Geneva Accords. The statement said that U.S. imperialism is increasingly strengthening its intervention in South Vietnam; the Ngo Dinh Diem dictatorial regime is intensifying its suppression and massacre of the people. They are desperately preparing for war, plotting to invade North Vietnam; they are stepping up their opposition to national independence movements, creating tension in Southeast Asia. U.S. imperialism blatantly violates the Geneva Accords, continues to send more and more military personnel to South Vietnam, ships in more and more war materials, promotes the collusion of South Vietnam with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and conspires to turn South Vietnam into a U.S. atomic war base in the region.

The statement said that while stepping up the conscription of soldiers, expanding the army, and building military bases, the U.S.-Ngo clique declared South Vietnam to be in a "state of war" and launched large-scale "sweeps," extremely cruelly and unprecedentedly massacring the people of South Vietnam. The U.S.-Ngo clique bombed South Vietnamese villages, shot large numbers of South Vietnamese people, even beheaded South Vietnamese people as a public display, threw corpses into the sea, raped women, plundered property, and burned houses. The Ngo Dinh Diem regime also formulated the "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959," established special military tribunals, and trampled on the most basic principles of law and humanity.

The statement said: The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam solemnly condemns and denounces to the people of the country and world public opinion the policy of the U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem ruling clique of massacring the people and the conspiracy to prepare for war. The Vietnamese people firmly believe that the brutal system of the U.S.-Ngo clique cannot extinguish the patriotic movement in South Vietnam; on the contrary, it can only further arouse the anger of the people throughout the country, prompting the people of South Vietnam to more resolutely carry out the struggle against the U.S. aggression and provocative actions and against the Ngo Dinh Diem ruling clique, the running dog of U.S. imperialism. The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam reiterates its consistent position: all issues concerning the interests of the motherland and the nation can and must be resolved on the basis of mutual consultation, understanding, tolerance, and without foreign interference. All methods and initiatives that create favorable conditions for contact between the people, groups, and authorities of the two regions, for the supreme interests of the motherland and the nation, will be welcomed. The statement finally emphasized that "The Vietnamese state and nation is a whole, and no reactionary force can divide it."

    越南政府就日内瓦协议签订五周年发表声明
    号召全越人民加强团结争取祖国统一
    新华社河内19日电　越南民主共和国政府就日内瓦协议签订五周年发表声明，号召越南全体人民加强团结、坚持斗争，争取在独立和民主的基础上统一祖国，在全国范围内完成民族解放事业。
    河内各报今天刊载的这项声明指出，亚非人民团结理事会作出的关于把1959年7月20日定为“越南日”的决定，显示了亚非各国人民坚决反对美帝国主义、反对战争，要求履行日内瓦协议和在独立、民主的基础上实现越南的和平统一的意志。声明说，越南全体人民对亚非各国人民、各社会主义国家的兄弟人民和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持表示深切的感激。
    声明在回顾日内瓦协议签订五年来的执行情况时指出，越南民主共和国政府在这个期间为日内瓦协议的实现进行了不懈的斗争；但是，另一方面，美帝国主义及其走狗则千方百计地破坏日内瓦协议，以致到目前越南还没有能够实现统一，越南的南半部还处在帝国主义和封建主义的统治下。
    声明接着谴责了美国—吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议的罪行。声明说，美帝国主义正在日益加强它对南越的干涉；吴庭艳独裁统治集团正在变本加厉地镇压和残杀人民。他们竭力准备战争，阴谋侵略越南北方；他们加紧反对民族独立运动，在东南亚地区制造紧张局势。美帝国主义明目张胆地违反日内瓦协议，继续向南越派遣越来越多的军事人员，运进越来越多的战争物资，促进南越同东南亚条约组织的勾结，阴谋把南越变成美国在这个地区的原子战争基地。
    声明说，美吴集团在加紧抓兵、扩充军队和建立军事基地的同时，宣布南越处于“战争状态”，并且发动大规模的“扫荡”，极其残酷地、史无前例地残杀南越人民。美吴集团炸毁南越的村庄、枪杀大批南越人民，甚至把南越人民砍头示众，把尸首投进海里，奸淫妇女，劫掠财物，焚烧屋宇。吴庭艳集团还制定“59年第十号”法令，设立特别军事法庭，践踏了法理和人道主义的最基本的原则。
    声明说：越南民主共和国政府向全国人民和世界舆论严正谴责和控诉美帝国主义和吴庭艳统治集团屠杀人民的政策和备战的阴谋。越南人民坚信，美吴集团的残暴制度决不能扑灭南越的爱国运动；相反地只能更加激起全国人民的愤怒，促使南越人民更坚决地进行反对美国的侵略和挑衅行动、反对美帝国主义的走狗吴庭艳统治集团的斗争。声明说，越南民主共和国政府重申它的始终不渝的立场：有关祖国和民族的利益的一切问题，可以而且必须在互相协商、谅解、忍让和没有外国干涉的基础上加以解决。为了祖国和民族的最高利益，为两地区的人民、团体和当局的接触创造有利条件的一切办法和倡议，都将获得欢迎。声明最后强调说：“越南的国家和民族是一个整体，任何反动势力也不能把它割裂。”
