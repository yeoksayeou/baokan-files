Centralized Leadership and Mass Movement in Industry
Niu Zhonghuang

The Great Leap Forward in China's industry in 1958 proved that the policy of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements in the industrial field is entirely correct. If we want to develop China's industry at high speed, we must resolutely implement this important policy of the Party.

What are the main contents of centralized leadership in industry? How can this centralized leadership be achieved?

Centralized leadership in industry, that is, the Party's leadership of socialist industry and the state's management of socialist industry, is fundamentally: the Party and the state, based on the experience of the broad masses and the urgent needs of China's economic development, formulate correct guidelines, policies, economic plans, and important rules and regulations, etc., and mobilize and organize the broadest masses to promote their realization. Like other construction undertakings, running industry must be under the centralized leadership of the Party and the state, and with the conscious and voluntary participation of the broad masses, to achieve victory. Without correct guidelines, policies, economic plans, rules and regulations, and working methods of the mass line adapted to them, there could be no such magnificent mass movement on the industrial front as it is now.

The Party and the state's guidelines, policies, and economic plans for developing industry, as well as important rules and regulations for managing industry, are nationally unified, and all localities, all industrial management organs, all industrial enterprises, and all employees must abide by them. The formulation and implementation of these guidelines, policies, economic plans, and rules and regulations are achieved through the mass movement of "from the masses, to the masses." There is both centralized leadership and mass movement, both centralization and democracy, both unified discipline and individual ease of mind, both central centralization of power and local decentralization of power. These are the basic principles for our leadership and management of industry.

The development of China's industry must be carried out under the unified guidelines and policies of the Party and the state. The Party and the state's guidelines for developing industry are the guidelines of walking on two legs. That is: under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, the simultaneous development of heavy and light industry, taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward on the industrial front, the simultaneous development of central and local industries, the simultaneous development of large and small and medium-sized enterprises, the simultaneous development of foreign and indigenous methods of production, and the principle that centralized leadership must be combined with vigorous mass movements. Since last year, the practice of the Great Leap Forward in industry has fully proved that all of these are correct guidelines for developing China's industry at high speed, and they must continue to be better implemented in the future.

To fully mobilize the masses, there must be correct guidelines and policies. People have learned from the Great Leap Forward, based on their personal experience, that the Party's complete set of guidelines for walking on two legs is the correct guideline that can best mobilize and organize the masses to participate in industrial construction. It is obvious that China's socialist construction mass movement, like the past revolutionary struggles, is not spontaneous, but is carried out under the unified leadership of the Party. Without the unified leadership of the Party and the state's centralized management of economic undertakings, the mass movement on the industrial front would not have correct guidelines, and therefore it would be impossible to achieve true victory. Therefore, carrying out vigorous mass movements on the industrial front must be carried out under the unified guidelines and policies of the Party and the state.

The development of China's industry is a "national chess game." That is to say, the development of the national industry must be carried out under the unified plan of the state, and must be subject to the management of the state. Under the guidance of the Party's unified guidelines and policies, adhering to the laws of planned and proportionate development of the socialist economy, and the unified plan of the state formulated by adopting the method of comprehensive balance, it represents the interests of the whole people and concentrates the will of the whole people; it guarantees both key development and the overall development of all departments of the national economy. At the same time, under the unified plan of the state, decentralized management is implemented to give full play to the initiative and creativity of localities and the masses. Under the guidance of the Party and the state's unified guidelines and unified plan, and on the basis of giving full play to the initiative and proactiveness of localities and the masses, the industrial development plans of the people's communes are uniformly planned by the county; the industrial development plans of the counties and special zones are uniformly planned by the provinces (municipalities) and autonomous regions; and the industrial development plans of the provinces (municipalities) and autonomous regions, after the comprehensive balance of the economic coordination zones, are uniformly planned by the central government. Important materials and equipment, and important technical forces, are allocated and distributed by the relevant departments of the central government in accordance with the unified plan of the state. Under such an arrangement of "national chess game", appropriate maneuverable authority is given to localities and enterprises.

Will implementing the "national chess game" and working according to the unified plan of the state hinder the enthusiasm of localities and the masses? We believe that doing so will not only not hinder the enthusiasm of localities and the masses, but can fully play the enthusiasm of localities and the masses. Without national overall planning, unified arrangements, and comprehensive balance, that is to say, without a "national chess game", it would not be possible to prevent and reduce the waste of resources and funds and the accumulation of products, it would not be possible to oppose capitalist management thinking and tendencies of localism, departmentalism, and anarchism, and therefore it would not be possible to mobilize the enthusiasm of all localities and all aspects of the country to the fullest extent, it would not be possible to have truly full mass movements, and it would not be possible to develop China's industry at high speed. Therefore, carrying out vigorous mass movements on the industrial front must be carried out under the unified plan of the state, and must be a struggle to complete and over fulfill the unified plan of the state.

Important rules and regulations for managing industry must also be nationally unified. Without unified rules and regulations, and without unified discipline, the Party and the state's guidelines, policies, and economic plans for developing industry cannot be well implemented. People know that unreasonable rules and regulations hinder the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and hinder the development of productive forces. Such rules and regulations must be broken. Reasonable rules and regulations, on the other hand, will not only not hinder the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, but can organize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and promote the faster development of productive forces. If, because of the need to oppose unreasonable rules and regulations, all reasonable rules and regulations are abolished, or even if they are not abolished, but some necessary and reasonable rules and regulations are allowed to go unchecked and are implicitly abandoned, causing some work to have no rules to follow or rules are not followed, resulting in some unnecessary confusion, this is certainly not a realistic attitude, and therefore it is incorrect. In fact, in the leadership and management of industry, necessary rules and regulations are indispensable. As far as the state's management of industry is concerned, such as the approval system for industrial construction projects and construction designs, the industrial planning management and financial management system, the labor wage and labor deployment system, as well as the quality standards of industrial products and the distribution system of industrial products, etc., must be nationally unified, and all industrial departments and all industrial enterprises should strictly abide by them. Otherwise, we will not be able to develop China's industry in a planned and proportionate manner, and therefore we will not be able to fully utilize the superiority of the socialist system to develop China's national economy at high speed. As far as industrial enterprises are concerned, such as process regulations and operating procedures, production preparation system, quality inspection system, equipment maintenance system, safety production system, workshop sanitation system, planning management, labor management, raw material, material, and financial management systems, etc., any factory, at any time, it is indispensable. Some people believe that with vigorous mass movements, rules and regulations are no longer needed. This view of opposing rules and regulations with mass movements is incorrect. They do not understand that the more the mass movement develops, the more it is necessary to strengthen leadership, the more it is necessary to establish and improve reasonable rules and regulations, and the more it is necessary to strengthen the responsibility system. Otherwise, the masses cannot be fully mobilized, or even if they are mobilized for a while, it is difficult to develop sustainably and healthily. As the ancients said: without rules, there can be no square or circle, that is the reason. Therefore, we should, with the development of the mass movement, on the basis of the broad masses participating in enterprise management, abolish various outdated and unreasonable rules and regulations, and at the same time, according to the creativity of the masses, establish and improve reasonable rules and regulations in a timely manner. However, before new and more reasonable rules and regulations have been formulated, do not rashly negate the original rules and regulations. The original rules and regulations that have been broken correctly must be affirmed; those that have been broken too much and those that have been broken without being established must be quickly established; various reasonable rules and regulations that have not been announced to be abolished, but have been allowed to go unchecked for a long time and are laxly implemented, should continue to be earnestly implemented.

Regarding the issue of centralized leadership in industry, according to the current situation, that is mainly what I have to say.

The Party and the state's centralized leadership and unified management of industry are based on relying on the initiative and creativity of the masses, that is, based on the mass line, that is, carrying out vigorous mass movements. Comrade Mao Zedong often said: As long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creativity of the people is endless, and therefore trust the people and become one with the people, we are invincible. The practice of China's revolution and construction convincingly proves that all revolutionary tasks and all construction tasks can only be fully realized by following the mass line and carrying out vigorous mass movements. This is the basic guarantee for our victory in revolution and socialist construction.

A few people once believed that since modern industry is technically complex, has a very fine division of labor, and requires centralized and unified command, it can only be done by a few people, and cannot be done by adopting the method of carrying out vigorous mass movements. They believed that the determination of guidelines and plans for developing industry is only a matter for the business leaders of the industrial sector; the design and technical work of industrial products is only a matter for a few experts; and the administrative work of industrial production can only be done by having the masses act according to orders from above. They believed that these tasks do not need to be discussed and decided by the Party committee, and do not need to consider how to concentrate the collective wisdom of the masses and how to rely on the initiative and creativity of the masses. All of these were refuted by the facts in China's industrial Great Leap Forward in 1958. People have clearly seen that in industry, as in any aspect, no work can be done well without the leadership of the Party and the mass movement. The management of industry certainly requires centralized and unified leadership, and at the same time, it also needs to carry out vigorous mass movements. The two can be unified, and only by unifying them can industry be developed at high speed.

So, in industrial enterprises, how to carry out large-scale mass movements under centralized and unified leadership? That is, the enterprise leaders are responsible for clarifying the current production tasks of the factory, the reasons for the tasks, the methods for completing the tasks, and the possible difficulties, to all employees. Then, with the focus on overfulfilling the factory's production plan, and focusing on the main problems currently existing in the factory, organize employees to speak out freely, put up big-character posters, and conduct large debates, concentrate the correct opinions of the masses, and implement them. While doing so, implement the system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." As a result, the leadership of the Party, the administrative management of the enterprise, and the mass movement are combined, and political work is combined with economic work and technical work. The implementation of this system truly absorbs workers to participate in production management and technical management, and effectively overcomes the bureaucratic style of leaders; it creates conditions for gradually eliminating the difference between mental and manual labor. The implementation of this method also greatly promotes the communist spirit of the employees, encouraging them to constantly break through the old production quotas and create new production miracles.

All good leadership methods must include both centralized leadership and vigorous mass movements. These are the two opposing aspects in the unity of leadership work. Only under the premise of centralized leadership can there be the broadest mass movement, and only on the basis of the mass line, that is, carrying out vigorous mass movements, can there be correct centralized leadership. The relationship between these two aspects reflects the relationship between leadership and being led, the relationship between individuals and organizations, and the relationship between the Party and the masses. If this relationship is handled well, it can unite the upper and lower levels, left and right, make people feel comfortable, work hard, and continuously leap forward. If it is not handled well, it will have the opposite result. Therefore, correctly handling the relationship between centralized leadership and vigorous mass movements in the industrial field, and organically combining them, has not only profound theoretical significance, but also very urgent practical significance.

Historical experience also proves that leading any mass movement, whenever the mass movement and centralized leadership are opposed or separated in understanding and practice, it will inevitably make mistakes, and it will cause a state of disorganization, indiscipline, and anarchy, which will harm the revolutionary cause. Therefore, emphasizing the carrying out of vigorous mass movements must not ignore or weaken centralized leadership. Everyone knows that the socialist industrialization cause is the cause of thousands of masses, and without centralized and unified leadership, without unified will and unified discipline, the task of developing socialist industry can never be won. Comrade Mao Zedong in "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" wrote: "Take the ideas of the masses (scattered and unsystematic ideas) and concentrate them (through study turn them into concentrated and systematic ideas), then go to the masses and propagate and explain these ideas until the masses embrace them as their own, hold fast to them and translate them into action, and test the correctness of these ideas in such action. Then once again concentrate ideas from the masses and once again go to the masses so that the ideas are persevered in and carried through. And so on, over and over again, so that each time these ideas are more correct, more vital and richer. This is what Marxist theory of knowledge teaches us." These words of Comrade Mao Zedong not only profoundly elucidate the importance of centralized leadership, but also profoundly elucidate the method of centralized leadership. On the industrial front, as on other fronts, such leadership methods must be conscientiously implemented.

    工业中的集中领导和群众运动
    牛中黄
    1958年我国工业的大跃进，证明了在工业方面的集中领导同大搞群众运动相结合的方针，是完全正确的。我们要高速度地发展我国工业，就要坚决地贯彻执行党的这个重要的方针。
    在工业方面集中领导的主要内容是什么呢？怎样才能实现这种集中领导呢？
    在工业方面的集中领导，也就是说党对于社会主义工业的领导和国家对于社会主义工业的管理，最基本的是：党和国家根据广大群众实践的经验和我国经济发展的迫切需要，制定正确的方针、政策、经济计划以及重要的规章制度等等，并且发动和组织最广大的群众，促其实现。办工业也和办其它建设事业一样，必须在党和国家的集中领导之下，并且有广大群众自觉自愿地参加，才能取得胜利。如果没有正确的方针、政策、经济计划、规章制度，以及同它相适应的群众路线的工作方法，也就不可能有像现在这样在工业战线上的波澜壮阔的群众运动。
    党和国家对于发展工业的方针、政策、经济计划，以及管理工业的重要的规章制度，是全国统一的，任何地方，任何工业管理机关，任何工业企业，和任何职工，都必须遵守。而这些方针、政策、经济计划和规章制度的制定和执行，又是通过“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众运动来实现的。又有集中领导，又有群众运动，又有集中，又有民主，又有统一的纪律，又有个人的心情舒畅，又有中央的集权，又有地方的分权。这些就是我们领导和管理工业的基本原则。
    我国工业的发展，必须在党和国家的统一的方针政策下进行。党和国家发展工业的方针，是用两条腿走路的方针。这就是：在重工业优先发展的条件下，实行工业和农业同时并举，重工业和轻工业同时并举，在工业战线上以钢为纲，全面跃进，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产和土法生产同时并举，以及集中领导必须同大搞群众运动相结合的方针。去年以来，工业大跃进的实践，充分地证明了所有这些，都是高速度发展我国工业的正确方针，今后仍须更好地贯彻执行。
    要把群众充分地发动起来，必须要有正确的方针政策。人们从大跃进中，根据切身的经验体会到党的一整套用两条腿走路的方针，是最能动员群众和组织群众来参加工业建设的正确方针。事情很明显，我国建设社会主义的群众运动，也同过去的革命斗争一样，不是自发的，而是在党的统一领导下进行的。如果没有党的统一领导和国家对于经济事业的集中管理，工业战线上的群众运动就没有正确的方针，因而也就不可能取得真正的胜利。因此，在工业战线上大搞群众运动，必须是在党和国家的统一的方针政策下进行。
    我国工业的发展，是“全国一盘棋”。也就是说，全国工业的发展都必须在国家的统一计划下进行，都必须服从国家的管理。在党的统一的方针、政策的指导下，遵守着有计划按比例发展的社会主义经济规律，和采取综合平衡的方法而制定的国家的统一计划，它代表着全民的利益，集中了全民的意志；它既保证重点发展，又保证国民经济各部门的全面发展。同时，在国家的统一计划之下，又实行分级管理，以充分发挥地方的、群众的积极性和创造性。在党和国家的统一方针、统一计划的指导之下，在充分发挥地方的和群众的积极性、主动性的基础上，人民公社的工业发展计划，统一由县负责规划；县和专区的工业发展计划，统一由省（市）、自治区负责规划；省（市）、自治区的工业发展计划，经过经济协作区的综合平衡以后，由中央统一规划。重要的材料和设备，重要的技术力量，由中央的有关部门按照国家的统一计划，进行调拨和分配。在这样“全国一盘棋”的安排之下，给地方和企业以适当的机动权限。
    实行“全国一盘棋”，按国家的统一计划进行工作，会不会妨碍地方的积极性和群众的积极性？我们认为，这样做，不但不会妨碍地方的和群众的积极性，而且可以充分地发挥地方的和群众的积极性。如果没有全国的全面规划、统一安排和综合平衡，也就是说，如果没有“全国一盘棋”，那就不能够防止和减少资源、资金的浪费和产品的积压，不能够反对资本主义经营思想和地方主义、本位主义、无政府主义的倾向，因而也就不可能最充分地调动全国各个地方、各个方面的积极性，不可能有真正充分的群众运动，不可能高速度地发展我国的工业。所以，在工业战线上大搞群众运动，必须是在国家的统一计划下进行，必须是为完成和超额完成国家的统一计划而斗争。
    管理工业的重要的规章制度，也必须是全国统一的，没有统一的规章制度，没有统一的纪律，党和国家对于发展工业的方针政策、经济计划也就不能很好地贯彻执行。人们知道：不合理的规章制度，妨碍群众积极性和创造性的发挥，障碍生产力的发展，这样的规章制度是必须破除的。而合理的规章制度，不但不会妨碍群众的积极性和创造性的发挥，反而能够把群众的积极性和创造性组织起来，能够促进生产力的更快发展。如果由于要反对不合理的规章制度，而把合理的规章制度也统统废掉，或者虽然没有废掉，但是，把一些必要的合理的规章制度放任自流，无形废弛，造成某些工作无规可循或者有规不循，以致产生某些不必要的混乱，这当然不是一种实事求是的态度，因而也是不正确的。事实上，在对工业的领导和管理方面，必要的规章制度是决不可缺少的。就国家对于工业的管理来说，如像工业建设项目和建设设计的审批制度，工业的计划管理和财务管理制度，劳动工资和劳动调配制度，以及工业产品的质量标准和工业产品的分配制度等等，就必须是全国统一的，各个工业部门和各个工业企业，都应当严格遵守。不然，我们就不可能有计划、按比例地发展我国的工业，因而也就不可能充分地运用社会主义制度的优越性来高速度地发展我国的国民经济。就工业企业来说，如像工艺规程和操作规程，生产准备制度，质量检验制度，设备维修制度，安全生产制度，车间卫生制度，计划管理，劳动管理，原料、材料和财务管理制度等等，任何工厂，任何时候，它都是不可缺少的。有人认为大搞群众运动，就可以不要规章制度了，这种把规章制度和群众运动对立起来的看法，是不正确的。他们不懂得，群众运动越发展，越需要加强领导，越需要建立和健全合理的规章制度，越需要加强责任制。否则群众也不能够充分地发动起来，或者虽然一时动起来了，也很难持久地健康地发展下去。古人说：没有规矩，不能成方圆，就是这个道理。所以我们应当随着群众运动的开展，在广大群众参加企业管理工作的基础上，废除各种过时的不合理的规章制度，同时，根据群众的创造，适时地建立和健全合理的规章制度。但是，在新的更加合理的规章制度还没有制定出来的时候，不要轻率地否定原有的规章制度。对于原有的规章制度，破得对的，一定要加以肯定；破得过了头的和破旧而未立新的，要赶快立起来；虽然没有宣布废除，但是长期放任自流，执行松弛的各种合理的规章制度，要继续认真地贯彻执行。
    关于工业方面集中领导的问题，根据当前情况，主要的就说这一些。
    党和国家对于工业的这种集中领导和统一管理是建立在依靠群众的积极性和创造性的基础上的，也就是建立在群众路线，即大搞群众运动的基础上的。毛泽东同志经常说：只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民和人民打成一片，我们就是不可战胜的。我国革命和建设的实践，令人信服地证明：一切革命任务和一切建设任务，只有走群众路线，大搞群众运动，才能完满的实现。这是我们取得革命和社会主义建设胜利的基本保证。
    有少数人曾经认为：现代化的工业既然是技术复杂，分工很细，又要求有集中统一的指挥，就只能由少数人来办，而不能采取大搞群众运动的方法。他们认为：发展工业的方针、计划的确定只是工业部门业务领导方面的事情；工业产品的设计和技术工作，也只是少数专家的事情；工业生产的行政工作，也只能由上而下要群众按命令行事。他们认为，这些工作，不需要经过党委的讨论和决定，不需要考虑如何集中群众的集体智慧，如何依靠群众的积极性和创造性。所有这些，在1958年我国工业大跃进中，都受到了事实的反驳。人们已经清楚地看到：在工业方面，也同任何方面一样，没有一项工作是能够离开党的领导和群众运动而办得好的。工业的管理当然需要集中统一的领导，同时，也需要大搞群众运动。这两者是可以统一起来的，而且只有把它们统一起来，才能高速度发展工业。
    那么，在工业企业中，在集中统一领导下面，怎样来搞大规模的群众运动呢？这就是由企业领导同志负责把工厂当前的生产任务，提出任务的理由和完成任务的方法，以及可能出现的困难，向全体职工交代清楚。然后，以超额完成工厂生产计划为中心，针对工厂当前存在的主要问题，组织职工大鸣、大放、贴大字报、进行大辩论，把群众的正确意见集中起来，贯彻下去。在这样做的同时，实行“两参、一改、三结合”的制度。这样做的结果，就使党的领导、企业的行政管理工作同群众运动结合起来，政治工作同经济工作、技术工作结合起来。这种制度的推行，真正地吸收了工人来参加生产管理、技术管理，并且有力地克服了领导人员的官僚主义作风；为逐步地消除脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别创造条件。这种方法的推行，同时又大大地发扬了职工们的共产主义精神，鼓舞他们不断突破旧的生产定额，创造新的生产奇迹。
    一切好的领导方法，都必须包括集中领导和大搞群众运动两个方面。这是领导工作这个统一体中的对立的两个方面。只有在集中领导的前提下，才能有最广泛的群众运动，只有在群众路线即大搞群众运动的基础上才能有正确的集中领导。这两方面的关系，反映了领导和被领导的关系，个人和组织的关系，党和群众的关系。这种关系处理得好，就能够使上下左右团结一致，心情舒畅，鼓足干劲，不断跃进。如果处理得不好，那就会得到相反的结果。所以，在工业方面正确地处理集中领导和大搞群众运动的关系，使它们有机地结合起来，不但有着深刻的理论意义，而且有着非常急迫的现实意义。
    历史经验同时也证明：领导任何一个群众运动，凡是在认识上和做法上把群众运动和集中领导对立起来或者分割开来，那就必然要犯错误，就会造成无组织、无纪律、无政府的状态，给革命事业以危害。因此，强调大搞群众运动，决不能忽视或者削弱集中领导。大家知道，社会主义工业化事业，是千千万万群众的事业，发展社会主义工业的任务，如果没有集中统一的领导，没有统一的意志和统一的纪律，就决不可能取得胜利。毛泽东同志在“关于领导方法的若干问题”中写道：“从群众中集中起来又到群众中坚持下去，以形成正确的领导意见，这是基本的领导方法。在集中和坚持过程中，必须采取一般号召和个别指导相结合的方法，这是前一个方法的组成部分。从许多个别指导中形成一般意见（一般号召），又拿这一般意见到许多个别单位中去考验（不但自己这样做，而且告诉别人也这样做），然后集中新的经验（总结经验），做成新的指示去普遍地指导群众。同志们在这次整风中（指1943年的整风运动——引者注）应该这样去做，在任何工作中也应该这样去做。比较好的领导，就是从比较善于这样去做而得到的”。毛泽东同志的这些话，不但深刻地阐明了集中领导的重要性，同时也深刻地阐明了集中领导的方法。在工业战线上也同在其它战线上一样，必须认真实行这样的领导方法。
