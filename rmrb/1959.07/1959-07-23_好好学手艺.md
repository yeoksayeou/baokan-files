Increasing service points, expanding service scope, and striving to bring convenience to people's lives are important aspects of improving urban service work. This aspect of work has attracted the attention of many cities. The main question that follows is how to continuously improve the quality of service.

For service personnel, improving service quality requires doing two things—improving ideological understanding and improving professional skills. Many service industry employees regard service work as a noble and glorious task, trying every means to bring convenience and joy to customers. A warm service attitude makes people feel close and warm, and makes them feel more happy. However, it is not enough to have only a warm service attitude. If the professional skills are not proficient, it will be difficult to serve customers well. Therefore, people who have already established advanced service ideas need to further improve their professional skills.

Some people think that the service industry does some trivial and routine work, and does not require any sophisticated skills. Actually, that is not the case. In terms of meeting the needs of the people, the service industry, although it relies on certain material resources, more importantly relies on the skills of service personnel. The level of craftsmanship makes a big difference. A good chef and a chef with poor skills will use the same ingredients to cook dishes with very different tastes. A skilled barber can create different hairstyles according to the customer's age, weight, and face shape to satisfy the customer. Tang Junchuan, a salesperson at the Xidan Vegetable Market in Beijing, was not skilled in the past, and three people had to wait in line to buy sesame paste. Now he has achieved "eyes as steelyard and hands as scales," which makes it much more convenient for customers to buy things. These examples show that doing service work well does require some "knowledge" and requires careful study.

Service personnel must master skilled techniques, they must study diligently and practice hard, and pay hard work; just like actors practice their skills, it is difficult to develop real skills overnight. Tang Junchuan's ability to learn "eyes as steelyard and hands as scales" is the result of recent hard work. This spirit of diligent study and hard practice is ultimately based on the idea of ​​serving the people wholeheartedly. Of course, the leadership department has the responsibility to do a good job in organization. Large-scale business learning organized by the Beijing commercial and service industries, and holding business and technical performance fairs, are all good methods that can be promoted.

    好好学手艺
    增设服务点，扩大服务范围，尽量给人民生活带来方便。这是改进城市服务工作的一个重要方面，这方面的工作已经引起许多城市的注意，紧接着提出的主要问题，是如何不断提高服务质量。
    对服务人员来说，要提高服务质量，需要作好两件事——提高思想认识，提高业务技术。许多服务行业的职工把做服务工作当作是一项崇高的光荣的任务，千方百计把方便和欢乐送给顾客。热情的服务态度使人感到亲切和温暖，使人更加心情愉快。但是，仅仅有热情的服务态度还不够，如果业务技术不熟练，也很难为顾客服务好。所以，已经树立了先进的服务思想的人，还需要进一步努力提高业务技术。
    有人认为，服务行业做的都是一些琐碎的事务性的工作，不需要什么高明的技术。其实不然。服务行业，在满足人民的需要方面，虽然要依靠一定的物质资料，而更重要的还要依靠服务人员的手艺。手艺高低，效果悬殊。高明的厨师和技术差的厨师，用同样的配料，炒出来的菜，味道会大不相同。手艺强的理发师能根据顾客的年龄、胖瘦和脸型，理出不同的发型，使顾客满意。北京西单菜市场售货员唐俊川过去技术不熟练，三个人打芝麻酱就得排队等候，现在他做到“眼是戥子手是秤”，顾客买东西就方便多了。这些例子说明，要作好服务工作确有一番“学问”，需要好好学习。
    服务人员要掌握熟练的技巧，必须勤学苦练，付出艰苦的劳动；好像演员练功一样，一朝一夕是很难练出真功夫的。唐俊川学会“眼是戥子手是秤”的本领，就是最近下苦功夫锻炼的结果。这种勤学苦练的精神，归根结底又建筑在热情为人民服务的思想基础上。当然，领导部门有责任作好组织工作。像北京商业和服务行业组织大规模业务学习，举行业务技术表演会，都是可以推广的好办法。
