Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd replied on June 22nd to two letters from Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi to the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, on February 18th and May 25th regarding the situation in Laos. Attached to the British Foreign Secretary's reply were copies of the British government's replies of April 7th and June 9th to the Soviet government's four notes of February 26th, March 21st, March 31st, and May 30th on the same issue, as well as a draft reply to the Chinese Foreign Minister's letter of February 18th proposed by the British side on April 7th.

In the aforementioned replies and letters, the British government, disregarding the facts, arbitrarily asserted that the actions of the United States and Laos did not violate the 1954 Geneva Accords and the 1957 Vientiane Agreements, nor did they constitute a threat to peace in Indochina.

In his letter of June 22nd to Foreign Minister Chen Yi, Lloyd further defended the Lao Kingdom government's perfidy and its launching of a civil war, saying: "The Lao government not only did not violate the Geneva Accords, but has been sincerely trying to incorporate those two former Lao battalions into the Lao army, in accordance with the agreement they reached with the Lao Patriotic Front in November 1957. The fact that one of these battalions was not incorporated into the Lao army, but instead fled into the jungle, is not due to the fault of the Lao government, but to the fault of the officers of this battalion."

Despite the fact that the Lao Kingdom government has not ceased its persecution, surveillance, and house arrest of leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and former Lao fighting forces, as well as other patriotic figures, the British government has tried to cover it up. The British Foreign Secretary said in his letter to Foreign Minister Chen: "The Lao government has announced that the temporary measures to monitor the personnel of the Patriotic Front and the Peace Neutrality Committee—the measures you mentioned in your letter of May 25th—no longer need to be maintained, and these parties can continue their activities, as long as these activities are within the scope stipulated by the constitution."

Finally, the British government also disingenuously stated: "As long as all parties concerned act strictly in accordance with the Geneva Accords in all respects, and especially in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, and do not interfere in the internal affairs of Laos, the peace and stability of Laos can be maintained."

The British government published the aforementioned letter from Foreign Secretary Lloyd to Foreign Minister Chen Yi on July 2nd. The British replies to the Soviet Union were also published on June 8th and June 10th, respectively.

### 劳埃德复信陈毅外长  硬为老挝破坏日内瓦协议辩护

    劳埃德复信陈毅外长
    硬为老挝破坏日内瓦协议辩护
    新华社17日讯　英国外交大臣塞尔温·劳埃德6月22日答复了我国外交部陈毅部长2月18日和5月25日就老挝局势问题给日内瓦会议两主席苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德的两次信件。随同英国外交大臣这封复信，还附有英国政府4月7日和6月9日就同一问题复苏联政府2月26日、3月21日、3月31日、5月30日四次照会的复照副本，以及4月7日提出的英方所拟英苏两国政府对中国外交部长2月18日信件的复信草稿。
    在上述历次复照和复信中，英国政府不顾事实，武断地认为，美国和老挝的行动没有违反1954年的日内瓦协议和1957年的万象协议，也没有构成对印度支那和平的威胁。
    劳埃德在6月22日给陈毅外交部长的信里还进一步为老挝王国政府背信弃义和发动内战的行为辩解说：“老挝政府不仅没有违反日内瓦协议，而且是一直真诚地试图按照他们在1957年11月同寮国达成的协议，把那两个前寮国营编入老挝陆军。其中一营没有编入老挝陆军，反而逃到丛林里去了，这不是由于老挝政府的过错，而是这个营的军官的过错。”
    尽管老挝王国政府对于老挝爱国战线党和前寮国战斗部队领导人员以及其他爱国人士的迫害、监视和软禁迄未停止，英国政府却力图加以掩盖。英国外交大臣在给陈外长的信里说：“老挝政府已经宣布，对爱国战线党和和平中立委员会人员进行监视的临时措施——即您在5月25日来信中提到的措施——已不需再维持下去，这些政党可以继续进行他们的活动，只要这些活动是在合乎宪法规定的范围以内的。”
    最后，英国政府还别有用心地表示：“只要有关各方在一切方面严格按照日内瓦协议行事，特别是按照日内瓦会议最后宣言第十二条的规定，不干涉老挝的内政，老挝的和平和稳定就能够维持。”
    英国政府已于7月2日公布了上述劳埃德外交大臣给陈毅外交部长的信。英国给苏联的复照也已分别于6月8日和6月10日公布。
