    Ginseng
    Ginseng is a precious medicinal plant. It is known as one of the "Three Treasures of Northeast China," along with sable fur and Ula grass, and is famous everywhere.
    Ginseng belongs to the Araliaceae family and is a perennial herbaceous plant. Wild ginseng is mostly produced in the Changbai Mountains and the Xing'an Mountains in Northeast China; cultivated ginseng is most abundantly produced in Fusong, Jilin. The ginseng plant sprouts in March or April, with opposite leaves and palmate compound leaves. It blooms with small white flowers in July and bears fruit in August. Ginseng is harvested after the White Dew solar term. Fresh ginseng is processed into ginseng. Wild ginseng generally takes more than 50 years to mature; cultivated ginseng also takes 6 to 12 years.
    Ginseng is sweet, slightly bitter, and warm in nature. It is often used to treat shortness of breath due to lung weakness, diarrhea due to spleen weakness, vomiting due to stomach weakness, as well as palpitations, restlessness, and forgetfulness due to shortness of breath.
    Chinese ginseng occupies an important position in the international market. More is needed in Southeast Asia.

    人参
    人参是一种珍贵的药用植物。它和貂皮、乌拉草并称为东北三宝，驰名各地。
    人参属五茄科，为宿根草本植物。野生的多产于东北长白山、兴安岭一带；人工栽培的以吉林抚松产量最多。参株三、四月发芽，对节生叶，掌状复叶，七月开小白花，八月结子。参的收获期在白露节以后。鲜参经过泡制即成人参。山参产成时期一般在五十年以上；园参产成时期也要六到十二年。
    人参性甘微苦温，多用于治疗肺弱的喘促、脾弱的泄泻、胃弱的呕吐，以及气喘的心悸、怔忡、健忘等。
    我国人参在国际市场上占有重要地位。南洋一带需要更多。
