Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 12th: A plan for the rational distribution of industry is being formulated here. The characteristic of this plan is to strengthen industrial construction in areas outside the capital, and to establish many small residential cities in the scenic areas around Budapest, approximately 25 kilometers away, in order to change the current phenomenon of excessive concentration of industry and population in the capital.

Currently, 51.9% of Hungary's industry is concentrated in the capital, with workers accounting for 49.9% of the national total, and nearly one-fifth of the total national population concentrated in the capital. The Economic Committee recently decided to relocate some or all of the twelve basic industrial construction projects originally planned for Budapest to other areas. Developing industry in other areas will be an important task for future industrial construction.

The many new residential areas planned to be built around Budapest will be quiet small cities with all modern facilities, capable of accommodating 10,000 to 50,000 people. No factories are planned to be built in these small cities around the capital, but some handicraft workshops that absorb housewives to participate in the work will be developed. This capital construction plan also includes the establishment of special express trains and other modern transportation tools to closely connect these small cities with the center of the capital.

Modern residential areas will also be built near industrial cities such as Miskolc.

    匈牙利合理安排工业布局
    加强首都以外的工业建设　在首都周围建立许多小城市
    新华社布达佩斯12日电　这里正在制订一项工业合理分布计划，这个计划的特点是加强在首都以外地区的工业建设，并将在布达佩斯周围二十五公里左右风景优美的地区建立很多供居住用的小城市，以便改变目前首都工业和人口过于集中的现象。
    目前匈牙利工业51.9％集中在首都，工人人数占全国的49.9％，全国总人口的将近五分之一集中在首都。最近经济委员会决定把原来计划建在布达佩斯的十二个工业基本建设项目，有些全部，有些部分地改建到外地去，发展外地工业将是今后工业建设的重要任务。
    计划在布达佩斯周围建立的很多个新住宅区将是些能容纳一万到五万人口的有一切现代化设备的安静的小城市。在首都周围的这些小城市里不打算建立工厂，但是将要发展一些吸收家庭妇女参加工作的手工艺性质的工场。这项首都建设计划还包括设置特别快车和其他现代化的交通工具，把这些小城市和首都中心紧密地联系起来。
    在密斯科尔兹等工业城市附近也要建立现代化的住宅区。
