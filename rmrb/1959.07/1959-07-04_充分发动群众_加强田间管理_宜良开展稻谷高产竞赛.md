Yiliang Launches High-Yield Rice Competition

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 3rd. Yiliang County's fifteen communes are launching a large-scale, high-yield, double-thousand jin rice competition, striving for production increases beyond planned targets.

This competition was initiated by the Penglai Commune. After concluding rice transplanting at the end of Xiaoman (Grain Full), the Penglai Commune proposed the slogan of overcoming the four hurdles for rice, demanding the diligent execution of weeding, fertilization, flood prevention, and pest and disease control, striving for a yield of two thousand jin per mu across the commune's thirty thousand mu of rice paddies, and proposing a competition to all communes in the county.

When the Penglai Commune proposed the competition initiative in mid-June, the Yiliang County Party Committee promptly studied it, considering this movement a good organizational form for comprehensively implementing the production policy of "diversification and increased yields" and "striving for high-yields on a portion of land", encouraging the people of the county to establish a mindset of continuous leaps forward, making continued efforts to win the mid-cultivation campaign, and striving for increased rice production. A High-Yield Command Headquarters was immediately established, led personally by the First Secretary of the County Party Committee. The Headquarters established three working groups, led by two County Committee members and one agricultural department head, going deep into the areas to summarize the various advanced technical measures during mid-cultivation, organizing on-site visits and experience exchanges, conducting inspections and evaluations, and unifying leadership over the entire competition movement. In addition, the County Headquarters also established over twenty mu of high-yield rice command fields, using these as a base to regularly study high-yield technical measures, explore the development patterns and control methods of pests and other disasters, in order to strengthen the concrete leadership of the large-scale high-yield competition movement. The County Party Committee also required each commune and management area to establish high-yield command headquarters and command posts, and to universally establish command fields, directly strengthening the leadership over the high-yield specialized teams.

In the large-scale high-yield competition movement, all localities in the county paid close attention to fully mobilizing the masses, organizing mass debates on how to increase grain production even more.

Each commune, management area, and production team seriously analyzed their own conditions, selected farmland with better soil quality, and established high-yield rice areas, responding to the initiative and launching the competition. The Wuxing Commune selected fifteen thousand mu from its thirty thousand mu of rice paddies to participate in the competition. The specific measures they adopted were: launching a movement to accumulate one thousand jin of green manure per person; increasing fertilization per mu from three thousand five hundred jin to six thousand jin; establishing a field management responsibility system, ensuring no waterlogging, no leakage, no weeds, and no pests. The Wusi Management Area of the Penglai Commune has already completed the first weeding on time and with quality, and has applied fertilizer to one thousand mu of fields. The second weeding has already been completed on 30% of the area. The county's daily weeding progress has increased from three thousand seven hundred and forty-five mu to nearly five thousand mu.

With the gradual deepening of the movement, the technical measures for increasing production have also become more solid and concrete. All localities are required to diligently weed four times within eighty days, implement rational irrigation, and apply topdressing fertilizer two to three times. Special emphasis is placed on rational fertilization, applying fertilizer based on seedling condition. Generally, first-class seedlings receive a standard application of three thousand jin of farmyard manure, second-class seedlings five thousand jin, and third-class seedlings ten thousand jin. All high-yield fields receive an additional application of one hundred jin of heat-treated phosphate fertilizer and one hundred jin of wood ash per mu, effectively overcoming the "three hurdles" of rice (regreening and tillering stage, stem elongation and panicle initiation stage, and grain filling stage), ensuring that each seedling cluster has no less than fifteen effective tillers, no less than two hundred thousand panicles per mu, no less than one hundred grains of rice per panicle, with each grain full, striving for a rice yield of two thousand jin per mu.

Xinhua News Agency report: In order to strengthen the field management of rice seedlings, the Baishu Management Area of the Yanjin Commune in Daguan County, Yunnan Province, has established a production responsibility system in which cadres manage to the area, commune members manage to the block, with four fixed stakes inserted into the field, and field management is assigned to each person, ensuring that each area has a general, each block has a soldier, the measures are solid, and the management is conscientious.

After the establishment of the field management responsibility system, the commune members responded very well. Some commune members call the fields they manage "responsibility fields", saying that they have to take a few more glances at their "responsibility fields". More than a dozen team leaders and above in the entire management area have strengthened their leadership over the areas for which they are responsible. The enthusiasm of the commune members has also increased, and many commune members go to their "responsibility fields" before dawn to check them before going to work, and they have to take a look after work to feel at ease. They also actively offer suggestions. The entire management area has submitted more than two hundred and fifty suggestions in just four days. For example, commune member Zhou Baoming discovered that the flood control ditch and hillside dam in his "responsibility field" had not been dredged, so he made a suggestion, and the team leader immediately dispatched four people to repair seven flood control ditches.

### 充分发动群众  加强田间管理  宜良开展稻谷高产竞赛

    充分发动群众  加强田间管理
    宜良开展稻谷高产竞赛
    本报昆明3日电　宜良全县十五个公社开展大面积稻谷双千斤高额丰产竞赛，并力争超计划增产。
    这个竞赛是在蓬莱公社倡议下开展起来的。蓬莱公社在小满结束插秧以后，即提出水稻过好四关的口号，要求作好薅草、追肥、防洪、除治病虫害四项工作，争取全社三万多亩稻田亩产两千斤，并向全县各公社提出开展竞赛。
    当6月中旬，蓬莱公社提出竞赛倡议的时候，中共宜良县委及时作了研究，认为开展这一运动是全面贯彻多种多收与在一部分土地上争取高额丰产的生产方针，鼓舞全县人民树立不断跃进的思想，再接再厉打好中耕战役，力争稻谷增产的良好组织形式。立即成立了高额丰产指挥部，由县委第一书记亲自领导。指挥部下设三个工作组，由两个具委委员和一个农业部长带领，深入到片负责总结中耕当中的各项先进技术措施，组织现场参观和经验交流，进行检查评比，统一领导整个竞赛运动。此外县指挥部还设了二十多亩水稻高额丰产指挥田，以这里为基点，经常研究高额丰产的一些技术措施，摸索病虫等灾害的发展规律和防治方法，以便加强大面积高额丰产竞赛运动的具体领导。县委还要求各公社和管理区也分别设立高额丰产指挥部和指挥所，普遍设立指挥田，直接加强对高额丰产专业组的领导。
    在大面积高额丰产竞赛运动中，全县各地十分注意放手发动群众，组织群众辩论：要用什么办法才能使粮食更多增产。
    各公社、管理区和生产队都认真分析了自己的条件，选出土质较好的农田，建立稻谷高额丰产片，响应倡议，开展竞赛。五星公社从三万多亩稻田里，选出一万五千亩参加竞赛。他们采取的具体措施是：开展每人积千斤绿肥运动；每亩追肥从三千五百斤增加到六千斤；建立田间管理责任制，做到不涝、不漏、无草、无虫。蓬莱公社五四管理区已经按时按质薅完了头道秧，追施了一千亩田的肥料，二道秧已经薅了30％。全县薅秧日进度已从三千七百四十五亩，提高到近五千亩。
    随着运动的逐步深入，增产技术措施也更踏实具体。各地都要求在八十天内，认真薅四道秧，实行合理灌溉，施二至三次追肥。特别强调合理追肥，看苗追肥。一般一类苗追施标准厩肥三千斤，二类苗五千斤，三类苗一万斤。全部高额丰产田每亩加施一百斤热制磷肥和一百斤草木炭，切实过好稻谷“三关”（返青发棵关，圆秆孕穗关和籽粒饱满关），保证每丛苗棵有效分蘖不少于十五苗，每亩不低于二十万穗，每穗不低于一百粒谷子，粒粒饱满，力争亩产稻谷二千斤。
    本报讯　为了加强禾苗田间管理，云南大关县盐津公社柏树管理区建立了干部管到片，社员管到块，四定插牌到田，田间管理到人的生产责任制，做到片片有将，块块有兵，措施踏实，管理认真。
    建立田间管理责任制以后，社员反映很好，有的社员把自己管理的田称做“责任田”，说对“责任田”都要多看它几眼。全管理区十几个队长以上干部，对所负责任的片都深入加强了领导。社员生产劲头也更大了，很多社员天蒙蒙亮都跑到自己的“责任田”去检查一遍才出工，收了工也要去看看才放心。发现问题也积极地提出建议，全管理区仅四天就提出了二百五十多条。如社员周保明发现“责任田”里防洪沟和拦山堰没有疏通，就提出建议，队长马上调派四人去培修了七条防洪沟。（附图片）
