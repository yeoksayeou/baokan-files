    Albanian People Exercise to Celebrate National Day
    Preparing to Hold Unprecedented National Games
    To welcome the grand festival of the 15th anniversary of liberation, Albania is actively preparing for this year's National Games, which will be held in the capital, Tirana, from October 4th to 11th. The scale of this sports meet, whether in terms of sports events or the number of participants, will greatly exceed previous sports meets. It is estimated that the final number of athletes participating in the finals will reach 10,000, which means that, based on Albania's national population, an average of one in every 140 people will participate.
    The grassroots selection competitions for various sports began nationwide as early as the end of last year. The number of athletes participating in the first stage of selection reached more than 76,000, including about 13,000 female athletes. They broke 88 national records. Currently, the second stage of the selection competition is being enthusiastically carried out across the country. For example, nineteen agricultural cooperatives in the Fier district selected twenty-six teams. This fully reflects the mass character of sports in Albania.
    At present, all parts of Albania are expanding and adding various sports facilities, and Tirana is rushing to build the Dinamo Stadium, which can accommodate 20,000 spectators.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民锻炼身体迎国庆
    筹备举行规模空前的全国运动会
    为了迎接解放十五周年这一盛大的节日，阿尔巴尼亚正在积极筹备今年的全国运动会，全国运动会将在10月4日到11日在首都地拉那举行。这次运动大会的规模无论是从运动项目或从参加的人数看，都将大大超过以往的运动大会，预计最后参加决赛的运动员将达一万人，即按阿尔巴尼亚全国人口计算，平均每一百四十人中就将有一人参加。
    各项运动的基层选拔赛早在去年年底就在全国开始了，参加第一阶段选拔的运动员就达七万六千多人，其中女运动员就有一万三千人左右。他们刷新了八十八项全国纪录。目前，第二阶段的选拔赛正在全国热烈地进行中。例如费里区十九个农业合作社就选拔出了二十六个小组。这充分体现了阿尔巴尼亚体育运动的群众性。
    目前，阿尔巴尼亚全国各地都在扩大和增设各项运动设备，地拉那正在赶建可容纳二万观众的狄纳莫运动场。
