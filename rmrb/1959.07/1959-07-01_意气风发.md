Afterword

    Full of Spirit

    Scene after scene of the vivid struggle against nature unfolds before our eyes:
    Frost and snow withered and killed the crops. Replenish them!
    Hail falling from the sky smashed the ripe vegetables. Plant them again!
    Mountain torrents washed away the wheat that was about to be harvested. Plant coarse grains.

    In the tense days of fighting against nature, the members of the Erliba Production Team of the Chengguan Commune in Lueyang County, Shaanxi, raised their heads and waved their powerful hands, making floods and frosts bow their heads again and again!

    In the face of disaster, without soaring revolutionary vigor and fiery enthusiasm, victory is impossible. The members of the Erliba Production Team are true revolutionary optimists. They are high-spirited and full of spirit, so of course they are invincible; their tenacious spirit will inevitably inspire the people in other disaster areas: be optimistic, actively fight against disasters, and make every effort to carry out production for self-salvation.

    意气风发
    一幕又一幕向自然斗争的生动场面展示在我们眼前：
    霜、雪使庄稼枯萎死去了。补种上！
    迎空而降的冰雹打烂了已经成熟的菜蔬。还要再种！
    山洪冲走就要到手的小麦。种上杂粮。
    在同自然斗争的紧张的日子里，陕西略阳县城关公社二里坝生产队的社员们昂起了头，挥动了有力的双手，一次又一次地叫洪水、霜冻低下了头！
    在灾害面前，没有冲天的革命干劲，火一般的热情，那是不可能取得胜利的。二里坝生产队的社员是真正的革命乐观主义者，他们斗志昂扬，意气风发，当然就战无不胜了；他们的顽强精神也必然鼓舞其他灾区的人民：要乐观起来，要积极向灾害斗争，要千方百计的展开生产自救活动。
