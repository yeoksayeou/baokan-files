    The Birth of the Superior Variety, Dwarf Nante
    Chen Junxiang
    In the days of the summer harvest, the reputation of the superior variety, Dwarf Nante, resounded throughout the Shantou Special District like spring thunder. People ran around spreading the good news of the Dwarf Nante's bumper harvest. But who could know that three years ago, it was just two rice plants, not easily discovered, in a vast sea of rice!
      What kind of "strange seed" is this?
    It was in May of 1956. One afternoon, Hong Chunli, the current Party Branch Secretary of the Dongcang Brigade of the Jinyu Commune in Chaoyang County, was inspecting the fields in Zhaihou. On the edge of a field planted with Nante seeds, he saw two robust and short rice plants that only grew leaves and not grains. He thought it was a "mutant rice" that wouldn't spike and found it very strange, so he squatted down to see it clearly. This made him both surprised and delighted, as the ears of rice were heavy and filled with grains like sickles under the leaves, with plump grains, a total of eighteen ears, and over a thousand grains. What kind of "strange seed" was this? This matter kept turning over in his mind. After dinner, the curious Hong Chunli was still pondering it. Suddenly, he recalled the models and pictures he had seen at the Guangzhou Agricultural Exhibition a few months ago, showing the cultivation process of various superior varieties, and he was greatly inspired. He thought: Isn't this a variety worth studying? So, he ran back to the field and inserted bamboo strips next to the two rice plants as markers, determined to figure out the details of the "strange seed."
    One day, it rained all night, and as soon as it was light, Hong Chunli went to the field with technician Hong Qunying. They saw that large areas of Nante rice had fallen down, but only these two "strange seeds" stood upright in the field, not losing a single grain of rice. What was the reason for this? They observed and compared in the field and found that its stems were more than a foot shorter than other varieties, and it also had "hidden spikes." He exclaimed with joy, as if he had solved a difficult problem, "It is these characteristics that prevent it from falling over." At this time, Hong Qunying also pulled up one of the plants and saw that the roots were numerous and long, and added, "Developed roots are also a reason!"
    The test of this rainstorm proved that these two "strange seeds" were unique and superior varieties. Therefore, they decided to cultivate them.
          First Cultivation
    After taking the rice plants home, Hong Chunli wrapped the ears of rice in white paper and handed them to Hong Qunying, a Communist Youth League member and technician, saying seriously, "The Party Branch has decided to give you the task of cultivating this new variety, and we hope you will cultivate it successfully!" Hong Qunying accepted this glorious and arduous task and considered how to carry out the cultivation experiment and shorten the time for promotion. He decided to use the method of transplanting late rice in the autumn, allocating a piece of land in the vegetable garden as a seedbed and sowing the more than a thousand seeds. He cared for the seedlings like he cared for his own baby. In order to prevent birds from pecking at them, he specially built a shed over the seedbed, covering it with a net woven from banana silk to prevent birds from flying in. Every day, he devoted most of his energy and time to this seedbed, which was only a few feet wide. Hong Chunli, like Hong Qunying, was very concerned about the growth of the seedlings, and he would go to the seedbed whenever he had time. One day, he noticed that the leaves of a small patch of seedlings were turning yellow and judged that watering at noon had scalded the roots of the seedlings, so he advocated weeding in the morning and watering in the evening, so that the seedlings could grow normally. More than twenty days later, the seedlings grew strong, most of them being "three-legged" seedlings. Hong Qunying transplanted them to the field in Zhaihouyang, strengthening management. After the beginning of winter, the thousand seeds yielded more than 155,000 grains, a total of eight jin and two liang.
    Overcoming Difficulties and Achieving Victory
    In the winter of 1956, Hong Chunli attended an enlarged cadre meeting convened by the county party committee. At the meeting, the party committee called for a high-yield movement to strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production. Hong Chunli was determined to use his newly cultivated Dwarf Nante seed to create a thousand-jin-per-mu experimental field. After returning to his hometown, he consulted with Hong Qunying, and they decided to cooperate, with Hong Qunying in charge. They sowed all the eight-plus jin of seeds they had harvested and planted more than six fen of land during the spring plowing.
    Shortly after transplanting, Hong Qunying found that the Dwarf Nante seedlings were growing weaker than other varieties. One day, he was observing in the field, studying ways to solve the problem, when an old farmer from Tiandong Village, Tiefo, passed by and saw him, pointing to the seedlings and sarcastically saying, "Qunying! Is this a thousand-jin-per-mu experimental field? In the future, even with the straw, you'll be over fulfilling the quota!" At first, Hong Qunying had also felt discouraged and disheartened because the seedlings were not growing well and because he was being attacked by rumors, but with the encouragement and support of the Party Branch, he quickly calmed down and continued to immerse himself in research. He pulled up a handful of Dwarf Nante seedlings and compared them with seedlings of other varieties, finding that the Dwarf Nante had more than twenty more roots than other varieties, and determined that it was necessary to apply a large amount of fertilizer. So, he immediately went to the cooperative committee and took more than five thousand jin of granular fertilizer and more than ten jin of fertilizer powder and applied it all at once. More than ten days later, the stems burst forth and became stronger, each plant branching out into seven or eight young seedlings, and he was very happy. He wrote in his notebook: "The Dwarf Nante has a developed root system and is suitable for planting in places with deep soil layers; sufficient base fertilizer and plenty of fertilizer are its first characteristic." During the heading period, some rice plants suddenly developed leaf blight, and he was very worried. He went to the field himself to observe, but still couldn't find the cause, so he invited the old farmer Hong Mianzhi from the production team to the field for consultation. Hong Mianzhi parted the dense rice leaves and felt that the soil was much hotter than other fields. He determined that because the rice stalks were short, the leaf surface was large, and the heat on the ground was not easy to dissipate, damaging the chlorophyll, so they contracted the disease. He advocated changing sunning the fields to shallow irrigation. Sure enough, after adopting the new method, the rice grew normally, the spikes were strong and healthy, and the disease was relieved. Therefore, he wrote in his notebook: "The Dwarf Nante is the opposite of other varieties, and needs to be irrigated during the period of young spike formation to heading, so that it is not easy to contract diseases."
    In the three-month cultivation process, Hong Qunying had learned the characteristics of the Dwarf Nante variety. When the early rice was harvested, this more than six fen of land yielded a total of five hundred and thirty jin of dry rice, an average yield of eight hundred and sixteen jin per mu. The commune members who had previously suspected that the Dwarf Nante was not a superior variety were convinced by the vivid facts.
              The Fame of the Bumper Harvest Shakes All Quarters
    After the summer harvest, the news of Hong Qunying's high yield in cultivating Dwarf Nante spread, and farmers came in an endless stream to exchange seeds. But with only five hundred-plus jin of seeds, how could he meet the people's needs? He told people that they would guarantee to work for another year or two to promote the superior variety.
    For more than two years, under the leadership of the Party, Hong Qunying has been conscientiously fulfilling this noble responsibility. In the early rice crop of 1958, the entire team promoted more than fifty-one mu of Dwarf Nante No. 1 superior variety. In the same year, he, together with Hong Chunli and Hong Yaokun, also managed two mu and seven fen of experimental fields. Due to gradually mastering the characteristics of the superior variety and continuously reforming cultivation techniques, they created a high yield record of an average of one thousand one hundred and forty-five jin per mu. The team's more than fifty mu of Dwarf Nante experimental fields also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average yield of eight hundred and fifty-six jin per mu.
    This year's early rice crop brought frequent good news of Dwarf Nante bumper harvests from various places. The Jinyu Commune also had more than sixty mu of high-yielding fields with yields of over a thousand jin per mu. Hong Qunying himself cultivated one mu, two fen and seven li of land with an average yield of one thousand two hundred and twenty-one jin per mu. Thousands of agricultural experts, cadres, agricultural models, and farmer representatives from all over the province have come to visit continuously; representatives from Sichuan Province who were visiting the Shantou Special District also rushed to visit after hearing the news, and took more than thirty jin of seeds, saying: Let it achieve a greater bumper harvest on the land of Sichuan.

    良种矮脚南特的诞生
    陈俊湘
    在夏收的日子里，矮脚南特良种的声誉，像春雷一样地轰动全汕头专区。人们奔走相告，传播矮脚南特丰收的喜讯。但谁能知道它在三年以前，只不过是在辽阔稻海里二株不大容易发现的稻禾！
      这是什么“怪种”？
    那是1956年5月的事情。一天下午，现任潮阳县金玉公社东仓大队支部书记的洪春利到寨后巡田。在一块种植南特种的田塍边，看见二株粗壮低矮的稻禾，只长叶，不长谷。他以为是不会抽穗的“变种禾”，觉得很奇怪，便蹲下去看个明白。这一下可使他又惊又喜，原来谷穗沉甸甸像镰刀般挤满叶下，谷粒饱满，共有十八穗，一千多粒。这是什么“怪种”呢？这事一直在他脑子里打转。晚饭后，好奇的洪春利还是苦苦地猜度着。猛然他回想起几个月前在广州农业展览会看到的各种优良品种培育经过的模型和图片，受到极大的启发。他想：这不是值得研究的品种吗？便又跑到田头，在二株稻禾旁边插上竹片作为记号，决心摸索“怪种”的底细。
    有一天，大雨下了一整夜，天麻麻亮洪春利就找技术员洪群英一起去田头，看见大片的南特稻倒伏下去，唯有这二株“怪种”却屹立田间，稻谷一粒不丢。这是什么缘故？他们在田头进行观察对比，发现它的茎秆比别的品种低一尺多，又抽“暗穗”。他像解答出难题似的狂喜地说：“就是这些特点才使它不会倒伏。”这时，洪群英也拔起其中一株，看见稻根又多又长，便补充说道：“根部发达也是一个原因哩！”
    这场暴风雨的考验，证明这二株“怪种”是与众不同的优良品种。于是，他们决定加以培育。
          第一次培育
    稻禾拔回家后，洪春利把谷穗用白纸包扎起来，交给当技术员的共青团员洪群英，严肃地对他说：“党支部决定把培育这一新品种的任务交给你，希望你把它培育成功！”洪群英接受了这一光荣而又艰巨的任务，便考虑着如何进行培育试验，缩短推广的时间。他决定采用晚造翻秋倒播的办法，在菜园地划出一块作为秧地，把一千多粒种籽播下。他像看护自己的婴孩一样，看护着秧苗的生长。为了防止鸟儿啄食，他特地在秧地搭了一个棚，用香焦丝遍成丝网盖着，使鸟儿不能飞入。每天他把自己的大部分精力和时间，贯注在这块仅有几尺宽的秧地里。洪春利也像洪群英一样，十分关心秧苗的生长情况，他一有空就要往秧地看看。有一天，他发现一小撮秧田的叶子发黄，判断是中午浇水，烫伤秧根，因此便倡议早晨除草，傍晚浇水，这样使秧苗正常生长。二十多天后，秧苗长的粗壮，大部分是“三脚”秧。洪群英把它移植到寨后洋上的田头，加强管理。立冬过后，千粒种籽共收十五万五千多粒谷，共产八斤二两。攻破难关　取得胜利　　1956年冬天，洪春利参加县委召开的扩大干部会议，会上党委号召大搞高产运动，争取农业生产大丰收。洪春利决心要用他新培育的矮脚南特种搞一块千斤亩的试验田。回乡后，他找洪群英商量，决定二人合作，由洪群英主管。他们把得到收成的八斤多种籽全部播下，春耕时插了六分多的田。　　插秧后不久，洪群英发现矮脚南特的禾苗生长得比其他品种都弱。有一天，他正在田头观察研究解决的办法时，田东村老农铁佛走过来看见了，指着禾苗讥讽地说：“群英！这是千斤亩的试验田吗？将来连稻草称上准超额啦！”洪群英起初也曾因禾苗长不好，和受到流言蜚语的打击而灰心泄气，但在党支部的鼓舞支持下，很快又安定下来继续埋头研究。他拔了一撮矮脚的南特禾苗和别的品种的禾苗进行对比，发现矮脚南特的稻根比其他品种多二十多条，断定必需大量施肥，于是立即向社委会领了五千多斤颗粒肥，十多斤肥田粉一次施下。过了十多天，禾茎迸发壮大，每条禾分出七、八条幼苗，他非常高兴。在笔记本上记下这样一段话：“矮脚南特根系发达，适宜种植土层深厚的地方；基肥要足，施肥要多，这是第一个特性。”抽穗期间，有部分稻禾骤然发生叶枯病，他急坏了，自己到田头观察，仍查不出原因，便约同生产队的老农洪绵芝到田头会诊。洪绵芝拨开浓密的禾叶，摸摸田土比别的田热辣得多，他断定是因为稻秆低矮，叶面宽大，地上热气不易散发，伤害叶绿素，所以染上病害，他主张改晒田为浅灌。果然，在采用新方法之后，稻禾生长正常，抽穗壮健，解除病害。因此，他又在笔记本上写着：“矮脚南特与其他品种相反，在幼穗形成期至抽穗期间需要灌水，才不容易传染病害。”
    三个多月的培育过程，洪群英已摸索到矮脚南特品种的特性。早稻收割的时候，这块六分多的田共打干谷五百三十斤，平均亩产八百一十六斤。过去怀疑矮脚南特不是优良品种的社员，在活生生的事实面前信服了。
              丰收声誉震四方
    夏收后，洪群英培育矮脚南特获得高产的消息传开，前来换种的农民络绎不绝。但是只有五百多斤种籽，怎能满足人们的需求呢？他向人们表示说，我们保证再干一、二年，把良种推广出来。
    二年多来，洪群英在党的领导下，兢兢业业地履行这个崇高的责任。1958年早造全队推广了五十一亩矮脚南特号良种。同年，他联合洪春利、洪耀坤又搞了二亩七分地的试验田，由于逐步掌握了良种的特性，和不断改革耕作技术，创造了平均亩产一千一百四十五斤的高产纪录。全队五十多亩矮脚南特试验田，也获得了空前的丰收，平均亩产达到八百五十六斤。
    今年早造，各地频传矮脚南特丰收喜讯。金玉公社还出现了六十多亩亩产千斤以上的高额丰产田，洪群英亲自培育的一亩二分七厘田平均亩产一千二百二十一斤。全省各地成千的农业专家、干部、农业模范、农民代表，不断前来参观；在汕头专区访问的四川省的代表闻讯后也赶来参观，并带去三十多斤种籽，他们说：让它在四川的土地上获得更大的丰收。
