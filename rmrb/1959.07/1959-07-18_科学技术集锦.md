Science and Technology Roundup

    Gifts from Bees
    People all know that bees can produce honey and wax, and pollinate crops, but they may not know that royal jelly, bee venom, and propolis all have medicinal properties.
    Why is the queen bee's body so large and its lifespan so long? According to experts, "royal jelly" plays a very important role here. They have found that after all bees hatch from eggs into larvae, worker bees generally secrete a white, pulp-like substance from their pharyngeal glands to feed them for the first three days, just like mammals breastfeeding. This pulp is "royal jelly." After three days, worker bee and drone larvae no longer eat royal jelly, but can only eat a mixed feed of pollen and honey, while queen bee larvae living in the "queen cell" (the nest where queen bee larvae live) can continue to eat the royal jelly that worker bees secrete into the queen cell. Worker bee larvae need 21 days to emerge from the bee cell, while queen bee larvae can emerge from the cocoon after 16 days. The queen bee's weight and body length are more than twice that of a worker bee. During the peak egg-laying period, it can lay about 2,000 eggs per day, with a total weight exceeding its own weight, and its lifespan can be as long as three to five years, while worker bees can only live for a few months. Scientists believe that royal jelly has such a large impact on the development of bee larvae, and this is a unique phenomenon in biology. According to foreign medical literature reports, royal jelly can make people strong and can treat neurasthenia, anemia, diabetes, female infertility, high blood pressure and other diseases.
    The venom secreted from the stinger at the tail of a bee is called "bee venom." The Soviet Union and other countries have long used it to treat rheumatic arthritis and other diseases. This year, the affiliated hospital of Peking Union Medical College conducted clinical trials. From the beginning of January to June 6, they used bee venom to treat 114 patients, including rheumatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, erythema nodosum, rheumatic fever, bronchial asthma and other diseases, all with certain recent curative effects. Among them, rheumatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis had the most cases and the best recent effects. The recent effective rate for the treatment of 53 rheumatic arthritis patients was 75.6%.
    Propolis is a mixture of resins and other substances collected by bees. The Sanatorium of the Yiwu Salt Affairs Bureau in Xinhailian City, Jiangsu Province, uses propolis patches to treat corns on the feet, with significant results. They believe that propolis contains substances that can soften and dissolve keratin. They treated 90 patients with corns, 68 of whom were cured, 9 improved, and 1 was ineffective; the treatment was interrupted for 12 people.

    Termites Have Multiple Kings and Queens
    The termite research group of the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Guangzhou, under the leadership of termite expert Li Shimei, recently conducted investigations and research on the Jingjiang Dam and discovered that each termite nest has multiple kings and queens.
    In the past, it was believed that the main nest of termites was very large, so the search for the main nest was mainly based on this principle; however, this time they found that some main nests were only three or four centimeters wide. This provides a new basis for finding the main nest in the future. In the past, it was believed that there was only one king and one queen per nest, but this time they found that there were two kings and two queens, two kings and four queens, and even three kings and four queens in one nest, and this was relatively common. This has important reference value for future termite prevention and control work.

    New Method for Castrating Roosters
    Rooster meat is coarse and low in fat, so people don't like to eat it.
    If a rooster is turned into a capon, the muscles can be made soft and juicy, the fat content can be increased, and the meat quality can become fresh and tender. The general method for turning a rooster into a capon is to remove its testicles. This is not simple. If the surgery is not skilled and the chicken's large blood vessels are damaged, it may cause death; the testicles often cannot be completely removed, and the remaining parts will form regenerated testicles, which will not achieve the original purpose; moreover, roosters suitable for castration must be between 60 and 80 days old and weigh about one catty. If they are too small, the testicles are difficult to find, and if they are too large, there is a risk of excessive bleeding.
    Now there is a good method—chemical castration.
    This method was recently successfully tested by teachers from the Animal Teaching and Research Group of the Biology Department of Fudan University in Shanghai. They designed and made a female hormone—diethylstilbestrol. This drug is made into cylindrical implantation pellets, and a special implantation device is used to insert it under the skin behind the comb. The method is simple and easy to learn. Generally, on the seventh day after implantation, the comb gradually atrophies, the feathers gradually become brighter, the movement is slow, the appetite increases, and the weight increases. After six to eight weeks, the highest fattening effect is achieved. (Attached picture)

    蜜蜂的恩赐
    人们都知道蜜蜂可以产蜜产蜡，为农作物传授花粉，但不一定知道蜜蜂的王浆、蜂毒和蜂胶都有疗病的作用。
    蜂王的躯体为什么特别大？寿命为什么特别长？据专家的研究，认为“王浆”在这里起了极重要的作用。他们发现：所有的蜜蜂由卵孵化成幼虫以后，在开头三天内一般都由工蜂从咽腺分泌出白色浆状物质来喂它们，就像哺乳动物的哺乳一样，这种浆就是“王浆”。三天以后，工蜂和雄蜂的幼虫就不再吃王浆，只能吃到花粉和蜜的混合饲料，而住在“王台”（蜂王幼虫居住的巢穴）中的蜂王幼虫，能继续吃到工蜂吐在王台中的王浆。工蜂幼虫需要二十一天才能出蜂房，蜂王幼虫十六天后就能脱茧出蜂房。蜂王体重和体长比工蜂大一倍以上，在产卵盛期，一昼夜能产卵二千左右，总重量超过它自己体重，寿命长达三年到五年，而工蜂只能活几个月，王浆对蜜蜂幼虫的发育有如此大的影响，科学家认为这在生物学上是一个特异的现象。据国外医学文献报道王浆能使人强壮，并能治疗神经衰弱、贫血、糖尿病、妇女不孕。高血压等疾病。
    蜜蜂尾部螫针中排泄出来的毒汁叫“蜂毒”。苏联等国早已用它来治疗风湿性关节炎等疾病。今年协和医学院附属医院进行了临床实验。从1月初到6月6日，他们用蜂毒治疗了一百一十四个病人，包括风湿性关节炎、类风湿性关节炎、结节性红斑、风湿热、支气管哮喘等十几种疾病，都有一定的近期疗效。其中病例最多、近期效果较好的是风湿性关节炎和类风湿性关节炎。治疗五十三个风湿性关节炎病人的近期有效率是75.6％。
    蜂胶是蜜蜂采集的树脂等混合物。江苏新海连市盐务局疗养所用蜂胶贴治脚鸡眼，有显著的效果。他们认为蜂胶包含着能软化和溶解角质的物质。他们治疗了九十个鸡眼病人，痊愈的六十八人，好转的九人，无效的一人；治疗中断的十二人。
    白蚁有多王多后
    中国科学院昆虫研究所在广州的白蚁研究组，在白蚁专家李始美的领导下，最近到荆江大堤进行调查研究，发现每巢白蚁有多王多后。
    过去认为，白蚁的主巢是很大的，因而在寻找主巢的时候，也主要是根据这个原则进行的；他们这次却发现，有一些主巢只有三、四公分宽。这为今后找寻主巢提供了新的根据。过去认为，每巢只有一王一后，这次他们发现在一巢中有二王二后和二王四后甚至三王四后的情况，而且是比较普遍的。这对今后进行白蚁的防治工作具有重要的参考价值。
    阉公鸡有新法
    公鸡的肉粗，脂肪少，人们都不喜欢吃。
    如果把公鸡变为阉鸡，就可以使肌肉柔软多汁、脂肪含量提高，肉质变得鲜嫩优美。要使公鸡变阉鸡，一般的方法是把它的睾丸切除。这就不简单，如果手术不熟练，伤了鸡的大血管，就可能引起死亡；睾丸往往不能完全去尽，残留部分会形成再生睾丸，达不到原来目的；而且，适于阉割的公鸡，须在六十到八十天之间、体重一斤左右时，太小了，睾丸难找，太大了又会有出血过多的危险。
    现在有了好方法——化学阉法。
    这一方法是上海复旦大学生物系动物教研组的教师最近试验成功的。他们设计制成了一种雌激素——己雌酚。把这种药物做成圆柱形的埋植丸，用一特制的埋植器把它从鸡冠后方插入皮下组织即可。方法简单，一学就会。一般埋植后第七天，鸡冠逐渐萎缩，羽毛渐增光彩，行动迟缓，食量增进，体重增加。经过六周到八周时间，达到最高的催肥效果。（附图片）
