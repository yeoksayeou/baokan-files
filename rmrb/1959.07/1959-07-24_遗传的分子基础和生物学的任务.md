The saying that dogs beget dogs, cats beget cats, plant beans and get beans, plant melons and get melons, is our ancestors' understanding of the universal phenomenon of heredity in the biological world. Then, what is it that links offspring and parents, maintaining their similarities, that is, why do children resemble their parents? This is a fundamental question in biology. For a century, from the discovery of Mendel's laws of inheritance of traits and Darwin's law of natural selection to the present, biological science research, through the combined use of experimental and historical methods, especially in the last dozen years, due to advances in research methods in physics and chemistry, has applied these methods to the analysis of specific processes of life activities, leading to a further understanding of the genetic material that links offspring and parents, from the level of cell structure, the chromosome and its assumed "genes," to the level of chemical molecular structure—deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, ДНК in Russian). This topic involves many disciplines in biology, such as physiology, embryology, cytology, genetics, microbiology, biochemistry, and biophysics, and has become the most cutting-edge task in current biological theoretical research. Therefore, as pointed out by Academician Dam of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a famous physicist: "In the near future, biology will replace physics as the protagonist in natural science" (see "The New Era of Biological Science," Science Popularization Publishing House, pp. 35-38). We biologists are now faced with this glorious and arduous task.

        The Molecular Structure of Deoxyribonucleic Acid and its Significance for Heredity
    In general sexually reproducing animals and plants, including humans, an individual develops from the union of a sperm produced by the male parent and an egg produced by the female parent. This fertilized egg does not possess the characteristics and traits of a growing individual, but it carries the genetic structure that links generations. As early as the beginning of the twentieth century, countless scientific facts not only indicated that this structure is contained within the nucleus of the egg and sperm, thus understanding why the very large egg and the very small sperm differ greatly in cytoplasmic volume, but the roles of the male and female parents in heredity are equal, and it was further clarified that chromosomes within the nucleus are the actual carriers of the genetic structure. As for what substances chromosomes are composed of that enable them to undertake the task of transmitting genetic traits, recording parental genetic traits, and then re-expressing them through cell division of the fertilized egg and development under certain conditions, this is the most critical issue in the mechanism of heredity.
    Regardless of the type of animal or plant, the nucleus of a general cell has a certain number of chromosomes, and in mature reproductive cells, through regular meiosis, the number of chromosomes is only half that of general cells. Chromosomes are mainly composed of two types of compounds, one is protein, and the other is deoxyribonucleic acid, together called nucleoprotein. Nucleoprotein can be called the material of life because in the most primitive life forms, like filterable viruses and bacteriophages, there are few or no other substances besides nucleoprotein. For a long time, it was believed that protein was the most important substance of life. Recently, more and more facts have proved that nucleic acids are more important than proteins, or at least equally important. There are two types of nucleic acids, one is deoxyribonucleic acid, and the other is ribonucleic acid (RNA or PHK). From the information obtained from various sources, it can be confirmed that deoxyribonucleic acid has a more important significance for heredity. First, cytochemical methods have proven that, except for chromosomes and bacteriophages, there is no or very little deoxyribonucleic acid in any other place. In a species, the amount of deoxyribonucleic acid is constant in different tissue cells, and in sperm cells, it is only half that of general cells, which is consistent with the ratio of chromosome numbers. Conversely, the distribution of various different proteins within the nucleus does not show this regularity. In several types of bacteria, especially in pneumococcus, treating strains with relative genetic traits with substances extracted from bacteria killed after having certain genetic traits can transform the latter into having the former's genetic traits and passing them on hereditarily. The extracted substance, called the transforming factor, has been proven to be deoxyribonucleic acid. This shows that deoxyribonucleic acid can play a role in directional mutation. The importance of nucleic acids in heredity has also been demonstrated in the process of bacteriophage infection of bacteria. T-series bacteriophages that invade E. coli are composed of 60% protein and 40% deoxyribonucleic acid. The periphery of the bacteriophage is a protein coat, and the middle is deoxyribonucleic acid. Using different radioactive isotopes, phosphorus-32 and sulfur-35, to label deoxyribonucleic acid and protein respectively, it was found that only deoxyribonucleic acid enters the bacteria, not protein. After a period of latency, the bacteria decompose and produce a large number of new bacteriophages with similar genetic traits. In tobacco mosaic virus, removing the protein using phenol treatment and retaining the nucleic acid can also have an infectious effect. These experiments clearly point out the close relationship between deoxyribonucleic acid (ribonucleic acid in plant viruses) and metabolism, reproduction, and heredity.
    As everyone knows, the variability of heredity generally occurs through mutations in the genetic material. Mutations can occur naturally, but after treatment with physical factors (such as various rays) or chemical factors (such as nitrogen mustard gas), the mutation rate can be significantly increased. Experiments have shown that the occurrence of mutations is also related to deoxyribonucleic acid. Using ultraviolet rays of different wavelengths to treat fungi or corn, it was found that the most effective wavelength for inducing mutations is equal to the wavelength at which deoxyribonucleic acid absorbs most strongly, both being 2600 angstroms (1 angstrom = 1/10,000,000 millimeters). Facts have also proven that mutagenic agents like mustard gas and X-rays are highly sensitive to deoxyribonucleic acid.
    The above has shown that deoxyribonucleic acid is different from protein, it is proportional to the amount of chromosomes, it is the transforming factor for directional variation in bacteria, it also plays a leading role in the process of bacteriophage infection, and it is also relatively sensitive to some physical or chemical mutagenic factors. However, to confirm that it is genetic material, it is also necessary to further explain: (1) the diversity and variability of genetic factors on chromosomes; (2) the duality of chromosomes and their replication process; (3) the relationship between deoxyribonucleic acid and protein. Here, we should especially thank physicists and chemists for their help. In the past short five to six years, great progress and good beginnings have been made in these areas. First, we have a preliminary and clear concept of the molecular spatial structure of deoxyribonucleic acid. The general situation is that deoxyribonucleic acid is a high molecular compound composed of many nucleotide units. It forms a long chain with proteins on the chromosome, a single nucleotide includes a phosphate group, a sugar group, and a base. Sugar groups and phosphate groups are arranged alternately, constituting the backbone of the chain, which is the same in any case. The bases are on the side of the long chain, and there are only four main types, namely two purines—adenine (A) and guanine (G), and two pyrimidines—thymine (T) and cytosine (C). One of the important characteristics of a deoxyribonucleic acid long chain is the duality of its molecular structure, paired long chains, spiraling parallel to each other, forming a spatial structural model. Like a spiral ladder, the phosphate-sugar chain leans against the outside of the ladder, and the bases face inward (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). The bases of one chain and the bases of another chain are paired by hydrogen bonds, like the steps of the ladder. Moreover, only a certain purine can pair with a certain pyrimidine; it is either adenine (A) with thymine (T), or guanine (G) with cytosine (C). The differences in deoxyribonucleic acid molecules are related to the ratio and different arrangement of the two paired bases. According to the鉴定（identification, assessment, appraisal） of the molecular weight of deoxyribonucleic acid and the results of X-ray diffraction analysis, the distance between the bases in a deoxyribonucleic acid long chain is 3.4 angstroms, and a deoxyribonucleic acid molecule has no less than one hundred bases. Since there are a total of four types of bases, the number of different relative positions is 4100, which will exceed the number of atoms in the solar system, and the number of stars we see with the naked eye is only one-third of 48. If the position and arrangement of paired bases have the significance of hereditary differences, then it is not difficult to imagine that the astonishing number of types of deoxyribonucleic acid molecules is sufficient to explain the diversity of genetic factors (or genes) on chromosomes. How is the variability of heredity, that is, the mutation of genetic factors, reflected in the possibility of changes in deoxyribonucleic acid molecules? It is known that many mutagenic factors, including ionizing radiation and the action of enzymes, can cause the destruction of phospholipid bonds between nucleotides and hydrogen bonds between purines and pyrimidines. It has been reported that the X-ray treatment of deoxyribonucleic acid solutions immediately produces the effect of hydrogen bond rupture, thereby causing the disappearance of the double helix and defects in the replication process. Moreover, from recent genetic work on a certain bacteriophage, it was found that a genetic factor locus can distinguish hundreds of physiological mutation points; it is speculated that a physiological mutation only needs to contain several nucleotides within the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule.
    Reports in the last two to three years have also pointed out that due to the separate application of radioactive isotope tracing and density gradient centrifugation, in five to six types of materials, some are bacteria, some are higher plants, it has been proven that when chromosomes proliferate and divide, the paired two tightly coiled deoxyribonucleic acid long chains, through the breaking of hydrogen bonds, twist and separate into two individual chains. At this time, the separated chains assimilate or absorb those nucleotides that have been synthesized in the surrounding area as chain links, combine to build a new chain and spiral together with the original separated chain, thus ensuring the maintenance of its structural duality. In this process, the paired bases are separated, the original adenine can only combine with the newly synthesized thymine, the original thymine with the new adenine, the original guanine with the new cytosine, and the original cytosine with the new guanine, thus also maintaining the specificity of the two types of paired bases. This illustrates the replication process of genetic material at the molecular level, and facts have proven that it is completed through the assimilation of corresponding substances that have been synthesized in the surrounding area. On this point, I believe that this embodies the essence of the self-renewal process of life matter pointed out by Engels.

    Deoxyribonucleic Acid's Control of Protein Synthesis and Human Control of Biological Traits
    Life is the mode of existence of protein bodies (see Engels: "Dialectics of Nature," People's Publishing House, p. 256). Then, how does deoxyribonucleic acid, as genetic material, jointly form the components of chromosomes with proteins, what is the relationship between the two, and how does deoxyribonucleic acid control genetic traits and characteristics through proteins? Solving this series of problems is another important task in solving the essence of life and its origin. Using the method of absorption heterogeneity, someone has confirmed that the polynucleotide chains of deoxyribonucleic acid and the polypeptide chains of proteins on chromosomes are arranged in a parallel rather than alternating relationship. In the simplest nucleoprotein in the sperm head of fish, it was found that there are double-helical deoxyribonucleic acid structures. The amino acid of fish sperm protein is mainly arginine. Using X-ray diffraction analysis, it was found that arginine also exists in pairs, and it has been proven that they surround the shallow part of the deoxyribonucleic acid double helix. Therefore, some people believe that the spatial structure of nucleoprotein is likely to be formed by the interaction of arginine residues and the bases in nucleic acids. At the same time, the distance between individual bases in the deoxyribonucleic acid long chain is 3.4 angstroms, and the distance between individual amino acids in the polypeptide chain is 3.5 angstroms, which also helps to explain the parallel arrangement of the two.
    As mentioned above, the replication of deoxyribonucleic acid includes the absorption of nucleotides that have been synthesized around (including purines and pyrimidines). Any biological synthesis process cannot be separated from the role of enzymes. Enzymes are proteins. Therefore, the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid ultimately cannot be separated from proteins. At the same time, both genetic and biochemical facts clearly point out that nucleic acids play a leading role in the synthesis of proteins. This shows that there is a relationship of mutual connection and mutual restriction between the two. Here, I will briefly introduce some views on how deoxyribonucleic acid controls genetic traits through protein synthesis. As mentioned above, there are two types of nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid is mainly in the nucleus, and ribonucleic acid is mostly in the cytoplasm. Many facts have proven that ribonucleic acid plays a more direct role in protein synthesis. So far, little is known about the correct relationship between the relatively constant amount of deoxyribonucleic acid in the nucleus and the ribonucleic acid in the cytoplasm. Recently, some experiments have pointed out that ribonucleic acid in the cytoplasm or its precursors are first formed in the nucleus, then transported out of the nucleus, and then play a role in promoting protein synthesis. This is consistent with the results obtained by separately treating bacterial fragments with deoxyribonucleic acid degrading enzymes and ribonucleic acid degrading enzymes, and also draws the conclusion that deoxyribonucleic acid controls the synthesis of proteins through ribonucleic acid. These observations are consistent with the conclusions obtained from numerous experiments in genetics, which believe that genes control genetic traits through the action of enzymes. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine that the specificity of deoxyribonucleic acid molecules as genetic material is finally reflected in proteins with a special amino acid composition. For example, the biochemical genetic facts of the famous human sickle cell anemia genetic trait point out that the mutation of a single gene (that is, the change of a deoxyribonucleic acid molecule) is expressed in the difference of one out of six hundred amino acids in the complex hemoglobin molecule (one glutamic acid is replaced by another valine in the normal hemoglobin molecule). Here, the assumption can be made that the determination of genetic traits is realized by the specificity of deoxyribonucleic acid molecules, under certain controlled conditions, through the synthesis of special protein molecules. Therefore, some people believe that in genetics, deoxyribonucleic acid can be regarded as a code, and the difference in genetic traits, that is, metabolic types, is equivalent to the information translated by the code (see Sheng Zujia: "Genetic Code—Transmission and Translation," Science and Technology Publishing House, forthcoming). If we use four different symbols on playing cards, spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs, to represent four different bases (see Figure 1), the different combinations of three of these symbols can form twenty different amino acids. It is estimated that a deoxyribonucleic acid has no less than one hundred bases, and a general chromosome has approximately one thousand bases. If the positions of base pairs are arranged in different orders, then a chromosome can write out one thousand very thick books according to the four-corner code. What chemical codes are translated into what genetic traits, this is the task of future biology, which is what Academician Engelhardt, director of the Department of Biology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, expects to be solved within fifty years (see "News from the 21st Century," Shanghai Science Popularization Publishing House, pp. 29-31). Of course, to complete this task, it is necessary to further clarify many key issues. However, we believe that future biological research, with the progress of physics and chemistry, will continue to explore using the latest physical and chemical methods, and will soon place complex life phenomena on the level of molecules and atoms one by one. In this way, people will be able to control and transform biological characteristics like mastering automation. Undoubtedly, this will have a revolutionary impact on agricultural practice and human health. At that time, the era of biology replacing physics mentioned by Academician Dam will arrive, and a science called biological control will appear.

                  The Inheritance and Class Nature of Science
    It should be pointed out that to rapidly improve and develop the current status of my country's biological science to a rigorous and accurate scientific level, on the one hand, under the leadership of the Party, we must mobilize all scientific research forces of relevant disciplines in my country's biological community, and strive for strong support from the physics and chemistry communities, actively carry out important and basic biological theoretical research work, and at the same time vigorously train young cadres who are both red and expert with broad and profound foundations in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. On the other hand, we must resolutely implement the Party's policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend to promote the prosperity of science. Regarding the latter, I have expressed some views not long ago (see "From 'Biological Code' to the Hundred Schools of Thought Contend in Genetics," Wenhui Daily, April 2, 1959). Here, I would like to add two more immature opinions.
    First, regarding the issue of scientific inheritance. Marxism-Leninism teaches us that people's knowledge of the laws of nature is relative, containing a part of absolute truth; only by constantly accumulating these particles of absolute truth can we gradually approach absolute truth. This means that any science is developing, and is gradually being perfected and completed. For example, in genetics, the chromosome inheritance theory proposed at the time and the subsequently developed gene theory were based on certain scientific facts. However, due to the limitations of the scientific level at the time and the influence of prevailing spontaneous generation, the wording inevitably reflected some metaphysical ideas, such as believing that chromosomes spontaneously generate chromosomes, genes spontaneously generate genes, and some individuals even proposed the view that genes do not change. Today, the development of science in this area has reached the molecular level, proving that chromosomes and genes can not only change naturally, but also change in large quantities under artificial conditions, and their reproduction is completed through the assimilation of corresponding substances in the surrounding area. In my opinion, these facts are fully in line with the dialectical materialist viewpoint. Therefore, we should not deny the theory that chromosomes and their assumed genes are the main material basis of heredity based on sufficient scientific facts because it contains certain metaphysical viewpoints in its theoretical development. For example, what would have happened in physics if we had denied Dalton's atomic structure theory at the time, which contained the idea that atoms do not change, when science today proves that the atomic nucleus can not only be split, but also degenerate? This is worth noting.
    Second, regarding the issue of the class nature of natural science. As is well known, natural science itself has no class nature, but the people who master or use these laws do have class nature. Imperialist elements have distorted and used the laws of chromosome and gene inheritance to promote the reactionary fallacy that there are superior and inferior races, which we must severely condemn. However, we must never reject the true content of chromosome and gene theory because of this. Animals and plants do have superior and inferior differences in heredity and evolution under natural conditions, and there is intraspecies struggle. Under human control, the difference between "good seeds" and "bad seeds" that are favorable or unfavorable to human needs becomes more apparent. However, humans may have genetic differences, but there is absolutely no distinction between naturally "good seeds" and "bad seeds." It is completely unnecessary if we deny this law applied to general organisms because human society does not have intraspecies struggle and the situation of "good seeds and bad seeds."
    It cannot be denied that in the field of biology today, especially in aspects involving some fundamental issues of biology, such as the views on the mechanisms of heredity and evolution, there are largely contradictory opinions and understandings. This requires fully展开（to unfold, to carry out (activities)） academic discussions and analyzing specific scientific facts and issues with a dialectical materialist viewpoint. Only in this way will we surely receive the benefits of learning from each other's strengths and making progress together. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we believe that my country's biological workers will correctly treat the current problems in biology and take on the glorious and arduous task of improving the level of biological science.

    遗传的分子基础和生物学的任务
    谈家桢
    狗生狗，猫生猫，种豆得豆，种瓜得瓜，这是我们祖先对生物界普遍存在着遗传现象的认识。那末，是什么东西把子代和亲代联系起来而使它们之间保持着类同性，也就是说为什么子女像父母，这是生物学上一个基本问题。一百年来，从孟德尔遗传特征传递规律和达尔文自然选择规律的发现到现在，生物科学的研究通过实验方法与历史方法的结合运用，特别是近十几年来，由于物理学上和化学上研究方法的进展，把这种方法应用到分析生命活动的具体过程上面来，已经对这个联系子代与亲代的遗传物质有了进一步的认识，即从细胞结构水平上的染色体和它上面所假定的“基因”，发展到化学分子结构——去氧核糖核酸（英文简称DNA，俄文简称ДНК）——的水平上。这个课题牵涉到生物学上的很多学科，像生理学、发生学、细胞学、遗传学、微生物学、生物化学和生物物理学等，已成为当前生物学理论研究中最尖端的任务。因此，正如苏联科学院院士、著名物理学家达姆所指出的：“不久将来，生物学将代替物理学担任自然科学中的主角”（参看“生物科学的新纪元”，科学普及出版社版，三五——三八页）。我们生物学工作者当前已面临着这个光荣而艰巨的任务了。
        去氧核糖核酸的分子构造和它对遗传性的意义
    在一般两性繁殖的动植物里，人类也不例外，一个个体是由父本产生的精子与母本产生的卵子结合发育而成的。这个受精卵不具有成长个体的特性和特征，但是负荷了世代之间联系的遗传结构。早在二十世纪初期，无数科学事实不仅指出了这种结构包含在卵核和精核里面，从而理解了为什么很大的卵子和很小的精子在细胞质容量上相差悬殊，而在遗传上父本和母本所起作用却相等，并且也进一步明确了核内的染色体是遗传结构的实际负荷者。至于染色体究竟是由哪些物质所组成，使它能够承担传递遗传特征的任务，把亲代遗传特征记录在上面，通过受精卵的细胞分裂和在一定条件下的发育，又重新表现出来，这是遗传机制上的最关键性的问题。
    不论那一种动植物，在一般的细胞核里面，具有一定数字的染色体，而且在成熟的生殖细胞里，通过有规律的减数分裂，染色体数只有一般细胞里的半数。染色体主要是由两类化合物组成的，一类是蛋白质，另一类是去氧核糖核酸，在一起叫作核蛋白。核蛋白可以称为生命物质，因为在最原始的生命体像滤过性病毒和噬菌体里，除了核蛋白以外，没有或很少有其他的物质。长期以来，一直认为蛋白质是生命最主要的物质。到了最近，越来越多的事实证明，核酸的重要性超过蛋白质，至少是同等重要。核酸有两种，一种是去氧核糖核酸，另一种是核糖核酸（RNA或PHK）。从各方面所得到的资料看来，可以肯定去氧核糖核酸对遗传性具有更重要的意义。首先，细胞化学方法证明，除了染色体和病毒噬菌体以外，任何地方没有或很少有去氧核糖核酸这类的物质。在一个物种里，去氧核糖核酸的分量在不同组织细胞里是恒定的，而且在精细胞里，仅是一般细胞的一半，这是与染色体数量的比例相一致的。相反的，各种不同的蛋白质在核内的分布，没有呈现这种规律性。在好几种细菌里，特别是在肺炎球菌里，用具有某种遗传特性的细菌杀死以后提炼出来的物质来处理具有相对遗传特性的品系，可使后者转化成为具有前者的遗传特性而遗传下去。这种提炼出来的物质，称为转化因素，证明是去氧核糖核酸。这说明去氧核糖核酸能起定向变异的作用。在噬菌体感染细菌过程中，也证明核酸在遗传上的重要作用。侵袭大肠杆菌的T系噬菌体是由60％蛋白质和40％去氧核糖核酸组成的。噬菌体的外围是蛋白质的膜，中间是去氧核糖核酸。利用不同的放射性同位素磷32和硫35，分别标志去氧核糖核酸和蛋白质，发现侵入细菌的只有去氧核糖核酸而没有蛋白质。经过一段潜伏时期，细菌分解后产生大量新的具有同类遗传特性的噬菌体。在烟草嵌镶病毒里，用酚处理的方法去掉蛋白质，保留核酸，同样可起感染的作用。这些实验清楚地指出去氧核糖核酸（在植物性病毒里是核糖核酸）与代谢、繁殖和遗传的密切关系。
    大家知道，遗传性的变异性一般是通过遗传物质的突变，在自然情况下可以发生突变。但是，在物理因素（如各种射线）或化学因素（如氮、硫芥子气一类的东西）处理后，突变率可以显著地增加。实验证明，突变的产生也与去氧核糖核酸有关。利用不同光波长度的紫外光线处理真菌或玉蜀黍，发现诱发突变最有效的波长是与去氧核糖核酸吸收最强烈的波长相等，同为2600埃（1埃＝1／10，000，000毫米）。事实也证明芥子气一类的诱变剂和X射线，对去氧核糖核酸都具有高度敏感性。
    以上已经表明，去氧核糖核酸不同于蛋白质，它与染色体分量成正比关系，它是细菌定向变异的转化因素，又在噬菌体感染过程中起主导作用，它对一些物理或化学诱变因素又比较敏感。但是，要肯定它是遗传物质，还要进一步说明：（1）染色体上遗传因子的多样性和可变性；（2）染色体的双重性和它的复制过程；（3）去氧核糖核酸与蛋白质的关系。在这里，我们应该特别感谢物理学家和化学家的帮助。在过去短短的五——六年里，这些方面的工作有了很大的进展和良好的开端。首先，我们对去氧核糖核酸的分子空间结构，有了一个初步的明确的概念。大概的情况是，去氧核糖核酸是一种高分子化合物，由很多核苷酸单位所组成。它在染色体上与蛋白质一起形成长链，单个核苷酸包括一个磷酸根、一个糖基和一个碱基，糖基和磷酸根相互交替排列着，构成链中的骨架，在任何情况下都是一样的。碱基是在长链的侧面，主要的只有四种，即两种嘌呤——腺嘌呤（A）和鸟嘌呤（G），两种嘧啶——胸腺嘧啶（T）和胞嘧啶（C）。去氧核糖核酸长链重要特性之一是它的分子结构的双重性，成对的长链，相互并行盘旋着，构成一种空间结构的模型。像一个螺旋式梯子，磷酸—糖链靠在梯子的外头一面，而碱基朝向里面（参看图1和图2）。一条链子的碱和另一条链子的碱，通过氢键结成对，像梯子的踏步一样。而且，也只有一定嘌呤与一定嘧啶结成对；不是腺嘌呤（A）与胸腺嘧啶（T）在一起，就是鸟嘌呤（G）与胞嘧啶（C）在一起。去氧核糖核酸分子的差异与两种成对碱的比数和不同排列程序有关。根据去氧核糖核酸分子量的鉴定和X线衍射分析的结果，去氧核糖核酸长链中的碱基之间的距离为3.4埃，一个去氧核糖核酸分子有不少于一百个碱。由于碱共有四种，所以其不同的相互位置就有4100，这就将超过太阳系的原子数，而我们肉眼看见的星数只不过是48的三分之一而已。如果成对碱的位置和排列有着遗传性差异的意义，那末就不难设想，去氧核糖核酸分子种类的惊人数字足够解说染色体上遗传因子（或称基因）的多样性了。遗传性的变异性，也就是遗传因子的突变怎样反映在去氧核糖核酸分子改变的可能性呢？已知道的就有许多诱变因素，包括电离辐射和酶的作用在内，可以引起核苷酸之间的磷脂键和嘌呤嘧啶间氢键的破坏。有人报告，去氧核糖核酸溶液经X射线处理后，立即产生氢键破裂的效应，从而引起双重螺旋形的消失和复制过程的缺陷。并且，从最近某种噬菌体遗传工作里，发现一个遗传因子的座位可以区分出数百个生理突变点；据推测，产生一个生理突变只须包含去氧核糖核酸分子内的几个核苷酸。
    最近二——三年间的报告又指出，由于分别应用了放射性同位素示踪法和比重梯变离心法，已经在五——六种材料里，有的是细菌，有的是高等植物，证明当染色体增殖分裂时，成对的二条密盘着的去氧核糖核酸长链，通过氢键的断裂，扭松分开成为二条个别的链子。就在这个时候，分开来的链子就同化或吸收了在周围已合成的那些作为链索环节的核苷酸，结合起来建成一个新的链子与原来分出来的一条并列盘旋在一起，这样就保证了维持它的结构双重性。在这个过程中，成对的碱基拆开，原来的腺嘌呤只能与新合成的胸腺嘧啶结合在一起，原来的胸腺嘧啶与新的腺嘌呤，原来的鸟嘌呤与新的胞嘧啶，原来的胞嘧啶与新的鸟嘌呤，这样也维持着二类成对碱的特殊性。这说明了在分子水平上，遗传物质的复制过程，并且事实证明它是通过同化了周围已合成的相应物质而完成的。在这一点上，我认为这是体现了恩格斯所指出的关于生命物质的自我更新过程的实质了。
    去氧核糖核酸对蛋白质的合成和人类对生物特性的控制
    生命是蛋白体的存在方式（参看恩格斯：“自然辩证法”，人民出版社版，二五六页）。那末，作为遗传物质的去氧核糖核酸怎样与蛋白质共同组成染色体的成分，二者之间的关系怎样，去氧核糖核酸又怎样通过蛋白质来控制遗传特性和特征，解决这一系列的问题又是当前要解决生命本质及其起源的重要课题。用吸收异相性的方法，有人证实染色体上的去氧核糖核酸的多核苷酸链索与蛋白质的多胜键链索，是一种并行而不是相间的排列关系。在鱼的精子头部最简单的核蛋白里，发现有成双的螺旋状排列着的去氧核糖核酸结构。鱼精蛋白的氨基酸主要是精氨酸。利用X线衍射分析，得出精氨酸也是成对存在着，并且证明它们是围绕着去氧核糖核酸双旋中的浅处。因此，有人认为，核蛋白的空间结构很可能是由精氨酸残基与核酸中的碱基相互作用而成的。同时，去氧核糖核酸长链中的各别碱上的距离为3.4埃，而胜键链上各别氨基酸的距离为3.5埃，这一事实也有助于说明二者并行排列的关系。
    上面讲过，去氧核糖核酸的复分产生包括吸收周围已合成的核苷酸等（嘌呤和嘧啶在内）。任何生物综合过程离不开酶的作用。酶又是蛋白质。因此，去氧核糖核酸的合成终究也脱离不了蛋白质。同时，不论是遗传学上还是生物化学上的事实，都清楚指出核酸对蛋白质的合成又起主导作用。这说明二者之间存在着相互联系和相互制约的关系。在这里，我简单地介绍一下关于去氧核糖核酸怎样通过蛋白质合成来控制遗传特性的一些看法。上面讲过，核酸有两种，去氧核糖核酸主要在核内，核糖核酸多在细胞质里。许多事实证明，核糖核酸对蛋白质合成起着更直接的作用。到目前为止，核内较为恒量的去氧核糖核酸与细胞质里的核糖核酸的正确关系，还知道得很少。最近，有些试验指出，细胞质中的核糖核酸或它的先驱物先在核内形成，然后输送到核外，再起促进蛋白质合成的作用。这与利用去氧核糖核酸分解酶和核糖核酸分解酶分别处理细菌碎片得到的结果，同样得出这样的结论：去氧核糖核酸通过核糖核酸来控制蛋白质的合成。这些观察与遗传学上无数实验所得到的结论，认为基因通过酶的作用来控制遗传特性，也是相符合的。因此，不难设想，作为遗传物质的去氧核糖核酸分子的专一性，终于反映在具有特殊氨基酸组成的蛋白质里。例如，有名的人类镰形血球贫血症遗传特征的生化遗传事实指出，单个基因的突变（也就是去氧核糖核酸分子的改变）就表现在复杂的血红蛋白分子内六百个氨基酸里面一个的差异（正常血红蛋白分子内一个麸氨酸为另一个缬氨酸所代替）。在这里，可以作出这样的假定，就是遗传特性的决定是由去氧核糖核酸分子的特殊性，在一定控制条件下，通过特殊蛋白质分子的合成而实现的。因此，有人认为，在遗传上，去氧核糖核酸可以看作是密码，遗传特性，也就是代谢类型的差异，相等于密码翻译出来的情报（可以参看盛祖嘉：“遗传密码—传递和翻译”，科技出版社即将出版）。如果以扑克牌上四种不同的记号，黑桃、红心、方块和梅花代表四种不同的碱（参看图1），其中三个信号的不同搭配就可构成二十种不同的氨基酸。估计一个去氧核糖核酸具有不低于一百个碱，一般染色体约略有一千个碱。如以不同次序安排碱对的位置，则一条染色体可按四角号码写出一千本很厚的书。关于什么化学密码翻译成什么遗传特性，这是未来生物学的任务，也就是苏联科学院生物学部主任恩格尔加尔德院士预期在五十年内可以解决的事情（参看“21世纪来的消息”，上海科学普及出版社版，二九—三一页）。当然，要完成这个任务，还须要进一步地搞清楚很多关键性问题。但是，我们相信今后生物学的研究，随着物理学和化学的进展，不断运用最新的物理学上和化学上的方法来进行探讨，就会很快地把复杂的生命现象，一一放置在分子和原子的水平上。这样，人们就将能像掌握自动化一样，控制和改造生物特性了。无疑的，这对农业实践和人类保健事业来说将会起革命性的作用。在那个时候，就到了达姆院士所说的生物学代替物理学的时代了，并且会出现一门叫作生物控制学了。
                  科学的继承性和阶级性
    应该指出，要把我国生物科学的现状，迅速提高发展到严密准确的科学水平上面来，一方面必须在党的领导下，调动我国生物学界有关学科的一切科学研究力量，并争取物理学界和化学界的有力支援和支持，积极开展重要的和基本的生物学理论研究工作，同时大力培养具有广博深厚基础数理化和生物学知识的又红又专青年干部。另一方面，还必须坚决贯彻党的为繁荣科学的百家争鸣的方针。关于后者，不久以前，我曾发表过一些看法（参看“从‘生物密码’谈到遗传学中的百家争鸣”，1959年4月2日文汇报）。在这里，我想再补充两点不成熟的意见。
    第一，关于科学继承性问题。马克思列宁主义教导我们，人们对自然认识的知识是相对的，中间包含绝对真理的部分；只有不断累积这些绝对真理的颗粒，才能逐渐接近绝对真理。这意味着任何科学在发展着，是逐步完善和完备起来的。例如，在遗传学上，当时提出染色体遗传学说和后来接着发展的基因理论，是有一定的科学事实为根据的。但是，由于当时科学水平的限制和风行的自生论的影响，在提法上不免反映一些形而上学的思想内容，如认为染色体自生染色体，基因自生基因，个别的甚至提出基因不变的看法。今天，这方面科学的发展已经达到了分子的水平，证明染色体和基因不仅在自然情况下可变，而且在人工条件处理下也可大量改变，它们的繁殖是通过同化周围相应物质而完成的。在我看来，这些事实是完全符合辩证唯物主义观点的。因此，我们不应该因为它在理论发展上包含着某些形而上学的观点，就否定了基于充分科学事实根据的染色体和它的上面所假定的基因作为遗传的主要物质基础的理论。又例如，道尔顿的物质原子结构理论，内中包含着原子不变的思想，今天科学证明原子核不仅可分裂，还可蜕变。当时如果我们否定了道尔顿的理论，在物理学上会产生什么影响呢？这是值得注意的。
    第二，关于自然科学阶级性问题。如众所周知，自然科学本身是没有阶级性的，而掌握或运用这些规律的人却有阶级性。帝国主义分子歪曲和利用了染色体和基因遗传规律，提倡所谓人种有优等劣等之分的反动谬论，我们必须严予指责。但是，我们绝不能因此就排斥了染色体和基因理论的真实内容。动植物在自然情况下，确实在遗传和进化上有优胜劣败之分，而且存在着种内斗争。它们在人类控制下更显得有有利与不利于人类需要的“好种”与“坏种”的区别。但是，人类在遗传上可有差异，却绝对没有天生的“好种”与“坏种”的区别。如果我们由于人类社会不存在种内斗争和“好种坏种”的情况，就来否定应用于一般生物上的这种规律，那是完全不必要的。
    不能否认，今天在生物学领域里，特别是在牵涉到生物学上一些根本问题方面，像对遗传和进化机制的看法，是存在着很大程度上不同见解和理解的矛盾的。这需要充分展开学术讨论，并且以辩证唯物主义观点来分析具体科学事实和问题。只要这样，必将收到取长补短、相互提高的好处。在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，我们相信，我国生物学工作者一定会正确对待当前生物学上存在的问题，担当起提高生物科学水平的光荣而艰巨的任务。（附图片）
