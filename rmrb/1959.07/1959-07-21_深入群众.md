    Going Deep Among the Masses

    The people's judicial work is to handle cases for the people. The method adopted by judicial workers in handling cases is the mass line. They go deep into the scene, deep among the masses, conduct trials on the spot, and so on. As early as the revolutionary base areas, the people's judicial workers adopted the methods of investigation and research, and on-the-spot trials. There were figures like "Commissioner Ma" in "Liu Qiao'er." They used these methods to try cases, and the judgments were reasonable and touching.

    Now, the people's judicial workers, in accordance with the Party and the People's Government's case-handling guidelines, further go deep into the scene, deep among the masses, and adopt the method of handling cases while working. They have developed the method of investigation and research, and on-the-spot trials, which not only handle cases in a timely manner but also facilitate the people. This is another proof of the superiority of the socialist system. The cadres of courts at all levels in Shandong have done this, and the people have applauded and praised: "In the old society, to file a lawsuit, you had to go to the city, suffer humiliation with money, and not understand what was happening; now, the cadres of the people's courts go to the countryside to produce and handle cases in the fields, which saves effort and doesn't cost money, and everything is clear." This sentence fully demonstrates that the mass line of the people's judicial work is beneficial to the people. This method should be promoted.

    深入群众
    人民的司法工作，是为人民群众办案的。司法工作者采取的办案方法是群众路线的。他们深入现场，深入群众，就地审判，等等。远在革命根据地的时期，人民司法工作者就采用了调查研究，就地审判的办法，出现过像“刘巧儿”中的“马专员”。他们就用这些方法审判了案件，判处得入情入理，令人感动。
    现在，人民的司法工作者，根据党和人民政府的办案方针，进一步深入现场，深入群众，采取一面办案、一面劳动的方法，发展了调查研究、就地审判的办法，既及时地办理了案件，又便利了人民群众。这是社会主义制度优越性的又一明证。山东各级法院干部这样做了，人民群众拍手称赞道：“旧社会打官司，跑到城里，人钱受屈，不明不白；现在人民法院干部到乡里生产，在田里办案，既省功夫又不花钱，三面对头，是非分明。”这句话充分表明了人民司法工作的群众路线有利于人民群众。这种方法还要发扬光大。
