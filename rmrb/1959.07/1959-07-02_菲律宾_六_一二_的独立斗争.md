    Philippine "June 12th" Independence Struggle

    Dear Editor:
    The "People's Daily" reported on June 28th that a ceremony commemorating the sixty-first anniversary of the Philippines' declaration of independence from Spain was held in Cavite Province, Philippines. At the meeting, some people requested that the Philippine Independence Day be changed from the current July 4th to June 12th. Please introduce the struggle of the Filipino people for independence sixty-one years ago.

    Answer: The Filipino people launched an armed uprising at the end of the nineteenth century to break away from Spanish rule and declared independence on June 12, 1898. However, at that time, American imperialism used force to replace Spain and established American colonial rule over the Philippines.

    From 1896 to 1898, the Filipino people, under the leadership of the "Katipunan" (meaning alliance), carried out an armed uprising against more than 300 years of Spanish rule. Due to the division of the uprising leadership group, the uprising suffered a setback, and the then leader Aguinaldo and others went into exile abroad. At this time, American imperialism, which had long coveted this Spanish colony in the East, took the opportunity to intervene and cunningly used the Philippine anti-Spanish uprising to realize its ambitions. The United States first sent a military envoy to conduct secret negotiations with the exiled Aguinaldo, and hypocritically promised that the United States would support his struggle for Philippine independence. Soon, on April 23, 1898, the United States declared war on Spain. Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines on an American warship and declared the independence of the Philippines in Cavite on June 12, 1898.

    By August 1898, Spanish colonial rule had actually been shattered by the Philippine people's war of independence, and only Manila and some other cities were still held by the Spanish. But the robber face of American imperialists who took advantage of the situation was openly exposed. It forbade the Philippine army from entering Manila and declared that the United States should "occupy" the Philippine capital. Aguinaldo had no choice but to move his troops away from the coast of Manila Bay and allow the US military to occupy Manila. After the US military entered Manila, the American flag was raised, and a treaty was signed with Spain on December 10, stipulating that the entire Philippine Islands and Guam would be ceded to the United States. The Filipino people were extremely indignant at the perfidy of the United States, and the Philippine army, disregarding the disparity in strength, launched a heroic battle against the American occupation forces. This was the just war of the Philippines against American aggression. The United States hurriedly deployed troops to reinforce and carry out bloody suppression, and it was not until 1906 that the American invading army suppressed the Philippine forces. Since then, the United States has implemented long-term and cruel colonial rule over the Philippines. It was not until after World War II that the United States, in order to whitewash its colonialist face, declared the Philippines "independent" on July 4, 1946, but it still continued to maintain its control and enslavement of the Philippines through various unequal treaties.

### 菲律宾“六·一二”的独立斗争

    菲律宾“六·一二”的独立斗争编辑同志：
    6月28日“人民日报”报道，菲律宾甲米地省举行纪念菲律宾宣布脱离西班牙而独立的六十一周年的典礼，会上有人要求把菲律宾独立之日从现在的7月4日改为6月12日。请介绍菲律宾人民在六十一年前争取独立的斗争。
        北京读者　胡载华
    答：菲律宾人民曾在十九世纪末发动了脱离西班牙统治的武装起义，并在1898年6月12日宣布独立。但当时美帝国主义使用武力，取代西班牙而建立了美国对菲律宾的殖民统治。
    从1896年到1898年，菲律宾人民在“迦提普南”（联盟的意思）领导下，进行了反西班牙三百多年统治的武装起义。由于起义领导集团的分化，起义一度遭到挫败，当时的领导人阿吉纳多等人流亡国外。这时，早就觊觎西班牙在东方这块殖民地的美帝国主义，乘机插手，狡猾地利用菲律宾的反西班牙起义来实现它的野心。美国先是派军事特使同流亡的阿吉纳多进行秘密谈判，并假仁假义地答应说美国将支持他为菲律宾独立而进行的斗争。不久，1898年4月23日，美国对西班牙宣战。阿吉纳多搭乘美国军舰回到菲律宾，并于1898年6月12日在科维特宣布了菲律宾的独立。
    1898年8月，西班牙的殖民统治实际上已经被菲律宾人民的独立战争粉碎了，只有马尼拉和其它一些城市还把持在西班牙人手里。但美帝国主义者趁火打劫的强盗面目公开暴露了。它不准菲律宾军队开进马尼拉，宣布美国应当“占领”菲律宾首都。阿吉纳多不得不把自己的部队从马尼拉湾沿岸调开，让美军占领马尼拉。美军开进马尼拉后，升起了美国国旗，在12月10日同西班牙签订了和约，和约规定菲律宾群岛全部和关岛都割给美国。菲律宾人民对美国的背信弃义行为极为愤慨，菲律宾军队不顾众寡悬殊，同美国占领军展开了英勇的战斗。这是菲律宾反对美国侵略的正义战争。美国急忙调兵增援，进行血腥镇压，直到1906年美国侵略军才把菲律宾部队镇压下去。从此美国对菲律宾实行了长期的残酷的殖民统治。直至第二次世界大战后，美国为了粉饰殖民主义面目，在1946年7月4日宣布菲律宾“独立”，但它仍通过各种不平等条约继续保持对菲律宾的控制和奴役。
