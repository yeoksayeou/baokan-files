    Seize the Golden Season of Dairy Production
    Inner Mongolia Actively Organizes Milk Source to Increase Dairy Products
    (Our newspaper reports) The golden season for the dairy industry has arrived. Various regions in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are vigorously focusing on the peak season for milk sources, organizing milk sources, and establishing small-scale dairy factories to accelerate the production of various dairy products to meet the needs of the state and the market.
    This year, the Party committees of various leagues in the Autonomous Region have attached great importance to the work of organizing milk sources. Recently, they have all dispatched personnel to go deep into pastoral areas and dairy households to conduct propaganda and organize milk source and procurement work. The Light Industry Bureau, Dairy Company, and various dairy factories of the Hulunbuir League have organized a large number of cadres and adopted the method of assigning responsibilities to specific areas to help commune pastoral production teams formulate plans and measures to expand milk sources. As a result, the milk procurement volume in this league has increased several times. The Xilingol League and various banners have organized work teams to go deep into the milk source areas to organize milk sources and help factories with production, resulting in a significant increase in milk sources.
    In order to seize the peak season for milk sources, improve dairy production, and carry out factory construction, the Inner Mongolia Light Industry Department has requested that all leagues further concentrate their efforts on milk procurement, while also accelerating factory construction and improving production. It pointed out that each banner, county, and city should conduct a comprehensive plan for the commune's dairy cows, appropriately arrange the proportion of milk for consumption by herdsmen and for processing, and organize as many dairy cows as possible that were not milked in the past to be milked. Local state-owned farms should attach equal importance to developing animal husbandry production and expanding milk source supply to factories for processing. In the future, within the milk supply areas of local state-owned factories, farms should be prohibited from establishing factories and processing on their own. Local governments should manage market milk consumption and sales prices. When developing commune factories, large-scale dairy factories must be built on the premise of ensuring agricultural and animal husbandry production. This year, the state has a very urgent need for lactose production. Areas with more separators should produce as much lactose as possible. Dairy powder factories with the conditions to produce lactose can also consider becoming factories that produce co-products.
    For factory construction, the policy of simultaneously building flat pan factories and simple spray factories should be adopted and continue to be built. After completion, produce for one month if possible, and produce for two months if possible. (Attached picture)

    抓紧乳品生产黄金季节
    内蒙古积极组织奶源增产乳制品
    本报讯　乳品工业的黄金季节已经到来，内蒙古自治区各地正大抓奶源旺季，组织奶源和建立小型乳品厂，加紧生产各种乳制品，供应国家和市场需要。
    今年自治区各盟党委非常重视组织奶源工作，最近都抽调力量深入牧区、奶户进行宣传，组织奶源和收购工作。呼伦贝尔盟轻工业局、乳品公司和各乳品厂，组织了大批干部，采取分片包干的办法，帮助公社牧业生产队订计划、拟措施来扩大奶源。因此，这个盟的牛奶收购量成倍增长。锡林郭勒盟和各旗组织工作组，深入奶源区组织奶源和帮助工厂生产后，奶源大增。
    为抓紧奶源旺季，搞好乳品生产和建厂工作，内蒙古轻工业厅要求各盟进一步集中力量抓住牛奶收购，同时还要加速建厂，搞好生产。指出各旗、县、市应把公社乳牛进行全面规划，适当安排牧民吃奶和加工比例，将以往不挤奶的乳牛尽量组织起来挤奶。地方国营牧场应以发展牧业生产和扩大奶源供应工厂加工并重，今后地方国营工厂供奶区内，一律要禁止牧场办厂和自行加工。市场牛奶消耗及销售价格，当地政府应加以管理。在发展公社工厂时，必须在保证农牧业生产的前提下，再大办乳品工厂。乳糖生产今年国家需要很迫切，分离机较多地区应尽量多生产一部分乳糖，有条件生产乳糖的乳粉厂，也可以考虑变为生产联产品工厂。
    对建厂工作要采取平锅厂与简易喷雾厂并举的方针，继续建下去，建成后能生产一个月即生产一个月，能生产两个月是两个月。（附图片）
