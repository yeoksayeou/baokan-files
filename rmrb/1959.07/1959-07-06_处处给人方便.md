Providing Convenience Everywhere
Producing and Repairing

    The Lanzhou Local State-Owned Red Star Woodworking Factory recently transferred technical personnel to produce a large quantity of daily necessities such as pot lids, wash basins, soy sauce buckets, chopping boards, small stools, washboards, bellows, bamboo door curtains, reed mats, bamboo baskets, and chicken coops to meet market needs.

    To facilitate the masses, the factory also set up two retail departments to sell these daily necessities and repair the above-mentioned utensils for customers.

Three-Skill Retail Department

    The Sixth Retail Department of the Baoding City West Street Woodworking Machinery Factory used to specialize in selling cages and sieves. To provide convenience for customers, they now also undertake repairs and processing. The retail department has a total of three people, who sell goods when busy and repair when not busy. Whether it's a broken cage handle, steelyard, bamboo strip, rattan thread, cage mat, sieve ring, or sieve bottom, these incomplete utensils become good-as-new items in their hands.

    To take care of out-of-town customers, this retail department also prioritizes repairs. If the steamer or pot purchased is not the right size, it can be returned or exchanged with a receipt, striving to satisfy customers.

Remittances Delivered to the Door

    Zheng Jinyou, a mail carrier at the Lügongbu Township Post Office in Renqiu County, Hebei Province, is a conscientious and well-loved mail carrier. Regardless of wind or rain, cold or heat, he always delivers newspapers, magazines, and letters to people on time. Recently, to reduce the trouble of receiving remittances and save labor, he delivers both the letter and the money to the households in the villages he is responsible for (without any errors).

    His approach has won the support and praise of the majority of commune members. Everyone says: The people's good mail carrier is truly not afraid of hardship, delivering remittances to the door. We should actively participate in production and guarantee a bumper harvest this year.

Five-Day Clothing Pickup

    Customers who come to the Yichang City First Garment Factory's retail department for processing no longer have to wait half a month or twenty days to have clothes to wear. When the salesperson hands you the receipt, they will tell you, "Pick up your clothes in five days."

    Not long ago, this factory only focused on completing batch orders with simple procedures to fulfill its output value plan. The retail department only kept a few apprentices to take on odd jobs. Recently, the factory transferred seventeen skilled technicians to take on the processing work at the retail department, greatly facilitating the masses.

Guaranteed to Fit

    The Tianjin Hongqiao District Dongfeng Shoe Store, to provide convenience for customers, has begun accepting small orders and making shoes to measure. They also offer services such as providing the upper and matching the sole, providing the sole and matching the upper, and edging the shoe opening. Recently, they have added eight services including sewing, mending, repairing, resizing, replacing soles, and converting men's old leather soles to women's soles.

Repairing and Replacing Collars

    The collars, cuffs, and trouser legs of fleece sweaters and pants, cotton interlock shirts and pants, and undershirts are easily worn out and difficult to repair oneself. The Tianjin Knitting Factory recently prepared many sturdy and durable thread cuffs and trouser legs and set up a repair service department at No. 3 Xinjiang Road, Heping District. Customers can restore their worn fleece sweaters and pants, cotton interlock shirts, etc., to look as good as new for just a few jiao. (Attached picture)

    处处给人方便
    既生产又修配
    兰州市地方国营红星木器厂最近抽调技术力量，大量生产各种锅盖、洗衣盆、酱油桶、案板、小板椅、搓板、风匣、竹门帘、房箔、竹筐、鸡笼日用杂品，供应市场的需要。
    为了便利群众，这个厂还设了两个门市部，零售这些日用杂品，并且替顾主修补上述各种用具。
    三能门市部
    保定市西大街木制机具厂第六门市部原来是专卖笼、箩的。他们为了顾客方便，现在也兼做修理和加工。门市部共三个人，忙了就售货，不忙就修理。不管是笼把、称子、竹乜子、藤线、笼席、罗圈、罗底等坏了，一经他们的手，残缺不全的器具就成了好物件。
    为了照顾外地顾客，这个门市部还优先修理，如买回去的笼屉和锅子大小不合适，还可以凭票退换，尽量使顾客满意。汇款送上门
    河北省任丘县吕公堡乡邮局投递员郑金友，是一个认真负责、受群众喜爱的好投递员。他不管刮风下雨，天冷天热，总是把报刊、信件按时送到人们手里。最近，他为了减少人们领汇款的麻烦，节省劳动力，对他负责投递的村庄，谁家汇来了钱，他就连信带款一起给送到户（没有出过差错）。
    他这种作法，得到了广大社员的拥护和赞扬，大家都说：人民的好邮递员真不怕辛苦，汇款送上门来，我们更应当积极参加生产，保证今年的农业大丰收。
    五天取衣
    近来，到宜昌市第一服装厂门市部加工的顾客，再不用等待半月二十天才有衣服穿了。营业员递给你收据的时候，就会向你嘱咐一声，“五天取衣”。
    不久前，这个厂只图作成批的、手续简单的活，完成产值计划。门市部只留几个学徒接零活。最近，厂里调了十七个熟练的技工担任门市部加工工作，大大便利了群众。
    包你合脚
    天津红桥区东风鞋店为了给顾客方便，开始接受零星订货，量脚制鞋。还有自帮配底，自底配帮，光沿鞋口等等，都给加工。最近他们又增加了缝补、修理，以大改小，换底，换后掌，男旧皮底改坤底等八项业务。
    修换领口
    绒衣裤、棉毛衫裤及汗衫的领口、袖口、裤脚极易磨破，自己又不好修补。天津针织厂最近准备了很多结实耐磨的股线袖口、裤脚，并在和平区新疆路三号设立了修补服务部；顾客只要花几角钱，就能把破口烂袖的绒衣裤、棉毛衫等整旧如新。（附图片）
