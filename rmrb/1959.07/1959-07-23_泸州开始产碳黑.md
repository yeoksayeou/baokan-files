    Luzhou Begins Carbon Black Production

    (From Our Newspaper) A semi-automated carbon black factory has been completed in Luzhou, Sichuan.

    The production capacity of this new carbon black plant is more than twice that of the Longchang Gas Mine. Once fully operational, it will be responsible for one-half of the carbon black production task of the Southern Sichuan Petroleum Mining Bureau. Currently, the various types of carbon black produced by this plant have already begun to be supplied to rubber factories and chemical plants across the country.

    泸州开始产碳黑
    本报讯　一座半自动化的碳黑工厂在四川泸州建成。
    这座新的碳黑厂生产能力超过隆昌气矿两倍多，全部投入生产后，将要担负全川南石油矿务局生产碳黑任务的二分之一。现在，这个厂生产的各种碳黑，已经开始供应全国各地橡胶厂和化工厂使用。
