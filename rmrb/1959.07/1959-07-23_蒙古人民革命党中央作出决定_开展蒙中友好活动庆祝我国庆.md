    Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee Decides to Launch Mongolia-China Friendship Activities to Celebrate Our National Day
    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, July 22nd: The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party recently made a decision to launch a 15-day Mongolia-China friendship activity throughout the country starting from September 16th this year to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    The Mongolian "Unen" newspaper published this decision today. The decision pointed out that the establishment of the People's Republic of China is a major event in the world since the October Socialist Revolution. It has enabled the Chinese people to forever get rid of the oppression of domestic and foreign rulers, and has unprecedentedly strengthened the socialist camp. The tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people in developing the economy and culture under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over the past ten years have not only gladdened and encouraged all countries in the socialist camp, but also encouraged all people in the world who are striving for freedom and independence.
    The decision stated that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, a fraternal and equal relationship based on the principles of proletarian internationalism has been established between the people of Mongolia and China, and the economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries has also been continuously expanding.
    The decision emphasized that holding a 15-day Mongolia-China friendship activity on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is of great significance for further enhancing the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the two peoples.
