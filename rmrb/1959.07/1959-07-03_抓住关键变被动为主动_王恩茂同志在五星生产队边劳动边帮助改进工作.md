    Grasp the Key to Turn Passivity into Initiative
    Comrade Wang Enmao Labors at the Five-Star Production Team While Helping Improve Work

    Urumqi, July 2nd (This newspaper) – After changing its leadership method of dispersedly using strength, the Five-Star Production Team of the Five-Star People's Commune in Turpan County, Xinjiang, completed the initial management work of the team's 2,500 mu of cotton fields ten days earlier than other production teams, and other crops were also well-managed. The tense labor situation and the passive situation in production have initially improved.

    The improvement of the leadership method of this production team was carried out with the personal help of the new commune member assigned to labor here – Comrade Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. At the beginning of June, the farm work facing this production team included: the cultivation, topdressing, and watering of 2,500 mu of cotton fields; thinning sorghum seedlings; picking apricots and grapes, and preparing for wheat harvesting. During this busy season when farm work was so concentrated, the cadres of the production team and the small teams failed to grasp the center, and improperly mobilized the labor force, forming a passive situation of attending to one thing and losing sight of another. At that time, the most important farm work was the topdressing and watering of cotton fields. Failure to topdress and water in time would inevitably lead to serious boll shedding. However, the cadres did not grasp this current central task, and regardless of whether the cotton fields needed it, they only carried out dry hoeing, postponing the topdressing and watering work until after weeding and loosening the soil three times. After Comrade Wang Enmao discovered this problem, he immediately suggested to the cadres of the production team: put the labor force into the most urgent work of watering and topdressing the cotton fields. According to Comrade Enmao's opinion, the production team held a cadre meeting and decided to draw people from other farm work that could be postponed to concentrate on watering and topdressing cotton fields.

    Comrade Enmao also found that in the cotton field cultivation and topdressing work, each small team on the one hand shouted that there was not enough labor, on the other hand, many high-efficiency cultivators and topdressing machines were idle. After Comrade Enmao made suggestions, these cultivators and topdressing machines are now being used. Each cultivator can cultivate twenty-one mu of land in one day with only two people and one horse, which is equivalent to twenty laborers working for one day; after using the topdressing machine, each machine can topdress fifteen mu per day, which is many times more efficient than manual labor. The problem of labor shortage has been basically solved. After inspecting the previous leadership methods, the cadres of the third small team concentrated their efforts on cultivating in batches and topdressing and watering in batches according to the order of sowing in cotton field management, changing the original chaotic phenomenon of topdressing and watering at the same time regardless of early or late sowing.

    After this production team firmly grasped the central farm work, the production work of the whole team was carried out in an orderly manner. Now the cotton is growing better than other teams, and the sorghum has also completed the thinning work after a few days of intensive efforts. In the past, picking apricots took up too much labor, resulting in wasted work; this situation has been improved.

    In this improvement of leadership methods and work style, the cadres of the Five-Star Production Team also examined that they had not participated in labor in a down-to-earth manner in the past, and therefore could not discover and solve problems in time. The Party branch has decided that in the future, two-thirds of the time of the production team cadres should be spent working with the commune members; the small team cadres should basically participate in labor all day long. This decision has been implemented.

    In order to improve labor efficiency, each small team has further promoted the small contract system and attached importance to ideological education for commune members. Now the attendance rate of each team has increased to about 95%, and labor efficiency has also generally improved.

### 抓住关键变被动为主动  王恩茂同志在五星生产队边劳动边帮助改进工作

    抓住关键变被动为主动
    王恩茂同志在五星生产队边劳动边帮助改进工作
    本报乌鲁木齐2日电　新疆吐鲁番县五星人民公社五星生产队改变分散使用力量的领导方法后，全队二千五百亩棉田的初期管理工作比其他生产队提前十天完成，其他农作物也管理得很好。劳力紧张和生产上的被动局面初步有了好转。
    这个生产队改进领导方法，是在下放到这里参加劳动的新社员——中共新疆维吾尔自治区党委第一书记王恩茂同志亲自帮助下进行的。6月初，摆在这个生产队面前的农活有：二千五百亩棉田的中耕、追肥、浇水工作；高粱定苗；摘收杏子、葡萄以及准备麦收等工作。在农活这样集中的大忙时节，这个生产队和各小队的干部抓不住中心，不适当的调动劳动力，形成了顾此失彼的被动局面。当时最主要的农活是棉田的追肥和浇水，如果不及时追肥、浇水，势必造成严重的落铃后果。但干部们却没有抓住这项当前的中心活路，也不管棉田是否需要，只是进行干锄，把追肥、浇水工作推迟到除草松土三次以后再进行。王恩茂同志发现这个问题后，立即向生产队的干部提出意见：把劳动力放到当前最紧急的棉田浇水和追肥工作上。生产队根据恩茂同志的意见，召开了干部会议，决定从其他可以暂缓的农活上抽人大搞棉田浇水、追肥工作。
    恩茂同志还发现，在棉田中耕和追肥工作上，各小队一方面叫喊劳动力不够用，另一方面许多高功效的中耕器、追肥机却闲置未用。经恩茂同志提出意见后，现在这些中耕器、追肥机都使用起来了。每台中耕器一天内只要两人一马就可中耕土地二十一亩，等于二十个劳动力干一天；利用追肥机以后，每台每天可追肥十五亩，比人工提高许多倍。劳动力紧张的问题基本上解决了。第三小队干部检查了以往的领导方法以后，在棉田管理上根据播种先后，集中力量分批中耕，分批追肥和浇水，改变了原来不管早播或迟播同时追肥和浇水的混乱现象。
    这个生产队狠抓中心农活后，全队生产工作进行得井井有条，现在棉花长得比其他队好，高粱经过几天突击，也已完成定苗工作。以往收摘杏子，占用劳力过多，结果形成窝工；这种情况已经注意改进。
    五星生产队在这次改进领导方法和作风中，干部们还检查了以往没有踏踏实实参加劳动，因而不能及时发现问题，解决问题。党支部已决定，今后生产队干部要有三分之二的时间同社员一起劳动；小队干部基本上要作到整天参加劳动。这项决定已经实行。
    在提高劳动效率上，各小队进一步推行了小包工制度，重视对社员进行思想教育工作。现在各队出勤率都提高到95％左右，劳动效率也普遍提高了。
