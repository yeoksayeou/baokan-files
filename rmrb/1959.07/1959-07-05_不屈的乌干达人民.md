The Indomitable People of Uganda
Luo Erzhuang

Recently, in the central region of the East African Plateau, sparks of opposition to colonialism have once again erupted. The people of Uganda, who have long suffered from British enslavement and oppression, have repeatedly voiced their calls for freedom and independence. Despite the British colonial authorities' implementation of bloody and cruel repression, the people of Uganda have not succumbed. On the contrary, they are increasingly and fiercely making heroic assaults on the dark and corrupt colonial rule. Their struggle for independence has shaken the imperialist dreams and gained widespread sympathy from the people of the world. To support the struggle of the Ugandan people, the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council announced a month ago that it would designate July 5th of this year as "Day of Solidarity with the People of Uganda," calling on Afro-Asian organizations of all countries to express their sympathy and support for the people of Uganda through all possible means.

Uganda, this rich and beautiful country located in equatorial Africa, has a territory of more than 243,000 square kilometers, where forests and lakes can be seen everywhere. Lake Victoria, the world's third-largest lake and the main source of the Nile River, shimmers with vast expanses of blue water in its southeast. This water source not only contains endless power but also brings abundant aquatic products. On the vast and fertile land, tropical plants such as cotton, coffee, tea, sugar, tobacco, and timber grow luxuriantly; and beneath the majestic peaks and grass-covered hills, precious minerals such as gold, copper, tin, nickel, and cobalt are buried. All of this, coupled with Uganda's important location in East Africa, has meant that the clutches of colonialism have tightly gripped this country for many years.

As early as the mid-19th century, Buganda, the main part of Uganda, was already a strong kingdom in equatorial Africa. In the second half of the 19th century, it became the target of plunder by imperialists such as Britain, France, and Germany. Imperialism used religion to incite wars in Uganda, creating national divisions within Uganda. In 1889, the tentacles of British colonialism – the British East Africa Company – sent troops into Buganda and, at the end of the following year, forced the King of Buganda to sign a servile agreement, placing Buganda under the "protection" of the company. In 1893, Britain defeated the King of Bunyoro within Uganda and took over the "protection" of Buganda from the East Africa Company. By 1896, Uganda as a whole had fallen into the status of a British "protectorate."

British colonialists carried out cruel rule and barbaric plunder of Uganda. Economically, the British controlled the lifeline of Uganda, forcing many Ugandans to engage in heavy labor like beasts of burden in their enterprises and plantations. Even the 1957 report on the situation in Uganda from the British Colonial Office shows that the degree of exploitation and discrimination suffered by Ugandans is astonishing. A European worker could earn forty to eighty shillings a day, but an Ugandan worker could only get eight to twenty-one shillings. And the cotton, coffee, tea, and other products laboriously produced by Ugandan farmers could only be sold to British business owners at shockingly low prices. According to the British "Uganda Development Corporation" alone, the company has made more than one million pounds in exorbitant profits since its establishment in 1952. While British business owners extracted huge profits, the colonial authorities also exploited the Ugandan people by collecting large amounts of exorbitant taxes, which plunged the Ugandan people into extreme poverty and suffering, even lacking the most basic necessities of life; many people suffered from serious diseases; on average, forty out of every hundred people did not live to be fifteen years old.

The colonialists also used hypocritical methods to deceive the Ugandan people. Uganda's Legislative Council has a total of sixty members, but it is stipulated that half of the seats are officials of the British colonial authorities, and the remaining thirty are elected at all levels, with Europeans and Asians each occupying six seats and blacks occupying eighteen seats. Just looking at the population of Uganda, one can see how seriously the rights of the Ugandan people are deprived. Of the nearly six million people in Uganda, blacks account for 99%, but only get one-third of the seats, while whites, who account for less than 1% of the total population, maintain absolute control in the Legislative Council. However, the colonialists shamelessly boast that Uganda under their cruel rule is a "model" colony. What kind of "model" is this? Let people see! In Uganda, the colonial authorities regard blacks as cattle and horses that can be arbitrarily enslaved and oppressed, and often resort to terror and persecution; the appalling conditions of the prisons are shocking. But even in prisons, the decadent colonial regime promotes racial discrimination; the treatment given to the most incorrigible British prisoners is thousands of times better than that given to blacks who have committed minor crimes.

Faced with the cruel oppression of colonialism, the Ugandan people have long risen up in resistance. During and after World War II, the Ugandan people's struggle against colonialism developed more vigorously. The nationwide strike movement in 1945 completely disrupted the city's supply, and then formed political demonstrations by workers and peasants. Although colonialism dispatched troops to suppress the movement in a panic, it was finally forced to increase wages. In 1946 and 1948, the "Bataka Party" and the "Uganda African Farmers Union" were established in Uganda successively, clearly putting forward the demands for national independence and democratic freedom, as well as the slogan of fighting against colonial rule, which gained widespread support among the people of the country. In April 1949, Uganda once again broke out in a nationwide general strike, demanding democratic elections to the parliament, the abolition of regulations on the sale of agricultural products, and higher wages. The colonial authorities dispatched a large number of military police to open fire on more than five thousand demonstrators, and at the same time ordered the dissolution of the "Bataka Party" and the "Uganda African Farmers Union," and sentenced some leaders to long prison terms. However, this kind of terror did not weaken the Ugandan people's will to resist colonial rule, and the struggle for independence and freedom has since developed more vigorously.

In order to consolidate colonial rule, further enslave the Ugandan people, and deprive them of their only meager rights to national autonomy, the British government proposed a plan in June 1953 to merge Uganda, Tanganyika, and Kenya into an "East African Federation," which triggered an unprecedentedly strong anti-British struggle throughout Uganda. Political demonstrations across the country responded to Britain's conspiracy. King Mutesa II of Buganda put forward the demand for Uganda's independence but was arrested by the colonial authorities and exiled to London. This further aroused the indignation of the Ugandan people. Large-scale demonstrations and marches continued to occur in many areas, finally forcing the British authorities to send Mutesa II back to Uganda in October 1955. In recent years, the Ugandan people's struggle for independence has continued to develop one after another. In mid-1957, following the large-scale demonstrations and marches in February and March, various parts of Uganda held a series of mass rallies and "Immediate Independence Struggle Week" in May, with thousands of Africans chanting "Freedom" slogans and marching in various places. The Uganda National Congress also issued a declaration demanding immediate and complete independence and put forward struggle goals such as immediate direct elections nationwide.

This year, encouraged by the national independence movements sweeping the colonies of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the Ugandan people's struggle for freedom and independence has developed even more vigorously. In particular, since April, anti-colonial rallies and demonstrations, as well as boycotts of foreign goods, have been launched frequently across the country. The British colonial authorities have also become more frantic in the face of this situation. On the one hand, under the pretext that the so-called African boycotts have caused "intimidation and turmoil," they have successively declared the "Uganda National Movement (Party)" to be "illegal," and on the other hand, they have declared the entire Buganda a "riot area," authorizing the colonial police to arbitrarily prohibit Africans from using vehicles in this area and forcing them to hand over spears, clubs, or other things deemed to be usable as weapons. At the same time, the colonial authorities are also further intensifying the persecution of Ugandan African nationalist leaders and using barbaric means such as summonses, arrests, and shootings to deal with the Ugandan people.

However, the Ugandan people have not been intimidated, and the flame of striving for freedom and independence burning in their hearts has not been extinguished.

Although British colonialists have adopted all kinds of brutal suppression methods in Uganda in an attempt to maintain their decadent rule, this is just a last-ditch struggle. With the support of the Afro-Asian people and the peace-loving people of the world, facing the gentle east wind, the sparks of striving for independence and freedom that are now erupting in Uganda will surely become a raging fire, completely burning down British colonial rule.

    不屈的乌干达人民
    罗尔庄
    最近，在东非高原的中部地区，又迸发着一簇簇反对殖民主义的火花。长期以来遭受英国奴役压迫的乌干达人民，一次又一次地发出争取自由独立的呼声。尽管英国殖民主义当局对此实行恐怖残酷的血腥镇压，但是，乌干达人民并没有屈服，恰恰相反，他们愈益强烈地向黑暗腐朽的殖民统治作着英勇的冲击。他们争取独立的斗争，震憾了帝国主义的迷梦，也获得了世界人民广泛的同情。为了支援乌干达人民的斗争，亚非人民团结理事会记书处在一个月前宣布把今年的7月5日作为“声援乌干达人民日”，呼吁各国亚非组织通过一切可能的办法，表达他们对乌干达人民的同情和支援。
    乌干达，这个位于赤道非洲的富饶美丽的国家，有二十四万三千多平方公里的国土，在那里到处可以看到森林与湖泊。尼罗河的主要发源地——世界第三大湖维多利亚湖，就在它的东南方泛着万顷的碧波。这一水源，不但蕴藏着无穷的动力，而且带来丰富的水产。在那一望千里的沃野上，棉花、咖啡、茶、糖、烟草和木材等等热带植物茂盛地生长；而在巍峨的山峰和复满绿草的土丘底下，又埋藏着金、铜、锡、镍、钴等等贵重的矿藏。这一切，加上乌干达在东非所处的重要位置，多少年来，殖民主义的魔掌就紧紧攫住了这个国家。
    远在十九世纪中叶，乌干达的主要部分布干达，就已经是赤道非洲强盛的王国。十九世纪下半期，它变成了英、法、德等帝国主义掠夺的对象。帝国主义在乌干达利用宗教煽起了战争，制造了乌干达内部的民族分裂。1889年，英国殖民主义的触角——英国东非洲公司派遣军队进入布干达，并在第二年年底强迫布干达国王签订了奴役性的协定，把布干达置于该公司的“保护”下。1893年，英国打败了乌干达境内的本约罗国王，并从东非洲公司手里接收了对布干达的“保护”权。到1896年，乌干达就整个沦为英国的“保护国”。
    英国殖民主义者对乌干达进行了残酷的统治和野蛮的掠夺。在经济上，英国人掌握了乌干达的命脉，使许许多多乌干达人被迫到他们的企业和种植园中从事牛马般的沉重劳动。即使从英国殖民地部1957年关于乌干达情况的报告也可以看出，乌干达人遭受剥削和歧视的程度是惊人的。一个欧洲工人每天可以获得四十到八十先令的工资，但是一个乌干达工人只能得到八先令至二十一先令的收入。而乌干达农民辛勤劳动所获的棉花、咖啡和茶叶等等，则只能以惊人低微的价格出售给英国企业主。仅据英国的“乌干达开发公司”透露，该公司从1952年建立以来，即已获得一百多万英镑的暴利。与英国企业主榨取巨额利润的同时，殖民当局也以征收大量苛捐杂税来盘剥乌干达人民，这就使乌干达人民陷于极端贫困与痛苦之中，甚至连最起码的生活必需品也没有；很多人患着严重的疾病；平均每一百个人中就有四十人活不到十五岁。
    殖民主义者还对乌干达人民耍弄虚伪的手法，企图欺骗乌干达人民。乌干达的立法议会共有议员六十名，但规定其中半数席位是英国殖民当局的官员，其余三十名则由各级选举产生，欧洲人和亚洲人各占六名，黑种人占十八名。只要看一看乌干达的人口情况，就可以看到乌干达人民的权利是多么严重地被剥夺了。在乌干达全国将近六百万人口中，黑人占99％，但只获得三分之一的席位，而不到全部人口的1％的白种人，却在立法议会中保持着绝对的控制。然而，殖民主义者却还厚颜无耻地把在他们残酷统治下的乌干达吹嘘为“模范”殖民地。这是什么样的“模范”呢？让人们看吧！在乌干达，殖民当局把黑人视为可供随意奴役、压迫的牛马，动辄施以恐怖镇压和迫害；监狱条件的恶劣是骇人听闻的。但甚至就在监狱里，腐朽透顶的殖民政权也推行着种族歧视；最怙恶不悛的英籍犯人得到的待遇要比犯了轻罪的黑人好上千百倍。
    面对着殖民主义的残酷压迫，乌干达人民早就起而反抗。第二次世界大战期间和战后时期，乌干达人民反对殖民主义的斗争更加蓬勃地开展。在1945年发生的全国性罢工运动，使城市的供应完全陷于中断，并随即形成了工人、农民的政治示威。虽然殖民主义在惊惶万状中出动军队进行镇压，但它终于被迫增加了工资。1946和1948年，在乌干达先后成立了
  “巴达卡党”和“乌干达非洲农民联合会”，明确地提出了民族独立和民主自由的要求，以及为反对殖民统治而斗争的口号，这在全国人民群众中获得广泛的支持。1949年4月，乌干达又一次爆发了全国性总罢工，要求议会民主选举、取消出售农产品的管制及提高工资。殖民当局竟派出大批军警开枪扫射五千多个参加请愿的群众，同时下令解散“巴达卡党”和
  “乌干达非洲农民联合会”，并把一些领袖人物判处了长期徒刑。但是，这种恐怖手段并没有能削弱乌干达人民反抗殖民统治的斗志，争取独立自由的斗争从此更加蓬勃地发展起来了。
    为了巩固殖民统治，进一步奴役乌干达人民并剥夺他们仅有的一点点可怜的民族自治权利，英国政府竟于1953年6月提出了把乌干达、坦噶尼喀和怯尼亚合并成为“东非联邦”的计划，这在乌干达全国引起了空前强大的反英斗争。全国各地以政治性示威来回答英国的阴谋。布干达国王穆特萨二世提出了给予乌干达独立的要求，但却遭到殖民当局的逮捕，并被放逐到伦敦。这就更进一步激起乌干达人民群众的义愤。许多地区不断发生声势浩大的示威游行，终于迫使英国当局不得不在1955年10月把穆特萨二世送回乌干达。近年来，乌干达人民的独立斗争仍在此伏彼起地发展。1957年中，紧接着2、3月间的大规模示威游行后，乌干达各地又在5月举行了一系列的群众集会和“立即独立斗争周”，数以千计的非洲人高呼着
  “自由”口号在各地游行。乌干达国大党也发表了要求立即完全独立的宣言，并提出在全国立即进行直接选举等斗争目标。
    今年，在席卷非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲殖民地的民族独立运动鼓舞下，乌干达人民争取自由独立的斗争更加高涨地发展，特别是自4月以来，一次又一次反对殖民主义的集会和示威游行，以及抵制外国货运动，频频地在全国各地展开。而英国殖民当局在这一形势面前也变得更加疯狂了，它一面在所谓非洲人的抵制引起了“恐吓和骚动”的借口下，先后宣布“乌干达民族主义运动（党）”为“非法”，一面又宣布整个布干达为“骚乱区”，授权殖民警察可以在这个地区任意禁止非洲人使用车辆，强迫他们交出长矛、棍棒或其他被认为可以用作武器的东西。同时，殖民当局也在进一步地加紧迫害乌干达的非洲民族主义的领袖，并以传讯、逮捕、枪杀等等野蛮手段来对付乌干达人民。
    但是，乌干达人民并没有被吓倒，燃烧在他们心中的争取自由独立的火焰也并没有被扑灭。
    尽管英国殖民主义者在乌干达采用了种种残暴镇压的手段，企图维持它腐朽的统治，但是，这只不过是苟延残喘的挣扎。在亚非人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，迎着习习的东风，现在在乌干达迸发着的争取独立自由的火花，必将成为熊熊的烈焰，彻底地烧毁英国的殖民统治。（附图片）
