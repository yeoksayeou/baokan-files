    Combining Machines, Horses, and Oxen to Improve Farming Efficiency
    20% of the Province's Cultivated Land Uses Agricultural Machinery and 30% Uses New-Style Animal-Powered Farm Implements
    (Our dispatch) This year, one-fifth of Heilongjiang Province's 100 million mu of cultivated land has begun to realize agricultural mechanization. Among them, the 15 million mu of cultivated land in state-owned mechanized farms uses agricultural machinery for all field operations from plowing and sowing to harvesting, threshing, and even winnowing, with a mechanization level reaching 70%; People's Communes with agricultural machinery are also continuously improving the level of tractor cultivation, developing from simply plowing and sowing at the beginning to harvesting some wheat fields and delivering manure to the fields. At the same time, this year in Heilongjiang, plowing, sowing, and wheat harvesting operations accounting for 30% of the cultivated land area are carried out using new-style animal-powered farm implements. According to many years of investigation by the agricultural department: crops sown using agricultural machinery, due to deep plowing and close planting, generally increase wheat production by 20% to 30%, and field crops generally also increase production by 10% to 20%.
    Heilongjiang Province has more land and a smaller population, and the rural labor force is relatively lacking. Each able-bodied laborer is responsible for an average of 40 to 50 mu of cultivated land, and laborers must also be drawn to support production in factories, mines, and forestry. Therefore, as early as 1947, the state began to establish state-owned mechanized farms here, and in 1951, it began to establish tractor stations. At the same time, a batch of new-style animal-powered farm implements were promoted. Up to now, the province has a total of 10,063 standard tractors (each standard tractor is 15 horsepower), 1,237 combine harvesters, and more than 246,000 pieces of new-style animal-powered farm implements. In addition, during the tool reform upsurge last year, a winch power machine that can be used for pumping water, generating electricity, and driving lathes was also created. These highly efficient tools, coupled with the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, have played an important role in implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and improving labor productivity. This year, 80% of the province's more than 10 million mu of spring wheat was sown with mechanical farm implements and new-style animal-powered farm implements. At present, most of the wheat seedlings are strong, fertile, and growing well; a large portion of the famous Northeast soybeans is also sown with mechanical farm implements and new-style animal-powered farm implements, and most of them are also growing very well. Using this superior tool can not only achieve deep plowing and reasonable close planting, but also is very efficient, which can save a large number of laborers. Last year, each laborer in the province's rural areas produced an average of 45 jin of grain per working day. Fully mechanized state-owned farms produce an average of 100 jin of grain per laborer per working day, with a commodity grain ratio of about 75%; People's Communes that use new-style animal-powered farm implements produce an average of more than 60 jin of grain per laborer per working day, with a commodity grain ratio of about half.
    In the process of promoting agricultural mechanization, Heilongjiang Province adopted different forms of state-owned farms, tractor stations, and new-style animal-powered farm implement promotion stations according to different times and conditions. The earliest established were state-owned farms. At that time, mutual aid and cooperation organizations in rural areas had not yet developed, so emphasis was placed on the demonstration role of state-owned farms for farmers. Now there are 85 state-owned mechanized farms in the province, and the degree of mechanization has reached more than 70%. New-style animal-powered farm implement promotion stations were established in the situation where the mutual aid and cooperation movement had formed a high tide, in order to fully promote new-style animal-powered farm implements and teach the use of new technologies. Tractor stations were established after the emergence of agricultural production cooperatives and were fully developed during the advanced cooperativization movement. At present, 80% of the new-style animal-powered farm implements are in the hands of the People's Communes. At the end of last year, each commune had more than 1,000 tractors (mixed type). In the process of vigorously promoting mechanical farm implements, Heilongjiang Province has always emphasized the principle of combining machines, horses, and oxen, starting from the development of production and giving full play to the role of machinery and horses. In some counties and communes where machinery is relatively concentrated, the effectiveness of mechanical farm implements and new-style animal-powered farm implements has been fully utilized by adopting this approach, which has saved a lot of labor for water conservancy construction, field management, and diversified operations. As a result, animal husbandry, sideline industries, etc., have been fully developed.
    In order to ensure the smooth development of agricultural mechanization, Heilongjiang Province pays great attention to the training of technical personnel and the coordination of machine repair work. In recent years, through methods such as apprenticeship and running schools, the province has trained more than 1,000 mechanical technicians and more than 20,000 tractor drivers, and has also established a province-wide repair network composed of large, medium, and small repair factories (stations). At the same time, more than 70 agricultural tool research institutes have been established at all levels in the province. (Long Gongpu) (Attached chart)

### 机马牛相结合　提高耕作效率  全省耕地20％使用农业机械30％使用新式畜力农具

    机马牛相结合　提高耕作效率
    全省耕地20％使用农业机械30％使用新式畜力农具
    本报讯　今年，黑龙江省一亿亩耕地中，有五分之一开始实现农业机械化。其中国营机械农场的一千五百万亩耕地，从翻地、播种，收割、脱谷直到扬场等田间作业，都用农业机器来进行，机械化程度已达70％；有农业机械的人民公社，运用拖拉机耕作的水平，也不断提高，由开始只是翻地、播种，发展到部分麦田的收割、田间送粪等项作业。与此同时，黑龙江今年还有占耕地面积30％的翻地、播种和麦收等作业，是用新式畜力农具耕作的。根据农业部门多年的调查：使用农业机器播种的作物，由于深耕密植，小麦一般增产20％到30％，大田作物一般也增产10％到20％。
    黑龙江省土地较多，人口较少，农村劳动力比较缺乏。每个整劳动力平均负担四十到五十亩耕地，还要抽出劳动力支援工厂、矿山和林业方面的生产。因此，早在1947年，国家就开始在这里举办国营机械农场、1951年开始举办拖拉机站了，同时，还推广了一批新式畜力农具。到现在，全省已有拖拉机一万零六十三标准台（每一标准台为十五牵引马力），联合收割机一千二百三十七台，还有二十四万六千多件新式畜力农具。此外，在去年工具改革高潮中，还创造出可以用于抽水、发电、带动车床的绞关动力机。这些效率很高的工具，再加上广大农民群众的冲天干劲，对贯彻农业八字宪法，提高劳动生产率起了重要作用。今年全省一千多万亩春小麦，其中80％是用机械农具和新式畜力农具播种的，目前大部麦苗肥壮，生育良好；著名的东北大豆，也有很大一部分是用机械农具和新式畜力农具播种的，现在大部长的也很好。使用这种优越的工具，既可以起到深耕和合理密植的作用，并且效率很高，可以省出大批劳动力来。去年全省农村每个劳动力，一个劳动日平均产粮四十五斤。全部机械化的国营农场，平均每个劳动力，一个劳动日产粮一百斤。商品粮比率75％左右；一些使用新式畜力农具的人民公社，一个劳动力平均一个劳动日生产粮食六十多斤，商品粮比率约占一半。
    黑龙江省在推行农业机械化过程中，根据不同时间，不同条件分别采取了国营农场、拖拉机站和新式畜力农具推广站等形式。建立最早的是国营农场，当时农村中互助合作组织还没有发展起来，因此强调国营农场对农民起示范作用。现在全省国营机械农场已达八十五处，机械化程度已达到70％以上。新式畜力农具推广站，是在互助合作运动已经形成高潮的形势下，为了全面推广新式畜力农具，和教会使用新技术而建立的。拖拉机站是在农业生产合作社出现以后建立的，在高级合作化运动中有了全面发展。到目前，80％的新式畜力农具在人民公社手中，去年年底各公社已有拖拉机一千多台（混合台）。在大力推广机械农具的过程中，黑龙江省一直强调机、马、牛结合的方针，从发展生产出发，充分发挥机械和马匹的作用。在一些机械比较集中的县和公社，由于采取这个方针，机械农具、新式畜力农具的效能，都得到了充分的发挥，就省出许多劳动力兴修水利、进行田间管理以及多种经营，如畜牧业、副业等得到了全面发展。
    为了保证农业机械化顺利发展，黑龙江省非常注意技术力量的培养，和机器的修配工作的配合。几年来，通过带徒弟，办学校等方式，全省已经培养了一千多名机械技术员，和两万多名拖拉机手，还建立了由大中小型修理厂（所）组成的全省规模的修理网。同时，全省还成立了各级农具研究所七十多处。（龙公朴）（附图表）
