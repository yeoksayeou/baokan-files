Aba Folk Songs

　　There are many birds on the many cypress trees. But I only hear one bird singing, and that is the lovely cuckoo. There are many flowers on the prairie. But I only fancy one kind of flower, and that is the beautiful Gesang flower. There are many girls in the village. But I am only waiting for one girl, and that is my lovely sweetheart.

　　Precious
　　I have a good tent, which can be unfolded and rolled up. Living in the tent today is more comfortable than a lama's temple. I have a good horse, which can walk and run. Riding on the white horse today, my bearing is grander than that of a Tusi. I have a good girl, who is both talented and kind-hearted. Marrying this girl today is more precious than having a fairy from heaven.

    阿坝山歌
    很多柏香树上的鸟儿很多。我却只听得见一只鸟叫，就是那可爱的布谷鸟。草原上的花儿很多。我却只看得上一种花儿，就是那美丽的格桑花。寨子里的姑娘很多。我却只等待着一个姑娘，就是我那可爱的小情人。
    珍贵我有一顶好帐篷，也能撑开，也能收卷。今天住在帐篷里，比那喇嘛的庙宇还舒适。我有一匹好马，走也会走，跑也会跑。今天骑在白马上，比那土司的派头还大。我有一个好姑娘，人材也好，心肠也好。今天娶了姑娘来，比那天上的仙女还珍贵。
