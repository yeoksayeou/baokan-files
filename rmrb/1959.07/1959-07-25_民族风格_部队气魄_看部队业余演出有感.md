Singing is a glorious tradition of the People's Army. In those fighting years, the soldiers marched to the battlefield singing majestic war songs. Wherever the troops fought, there were liberation songs. This time, on the stage of the capital, we heard many wonderful musical programs from the All-Army Literary and Art Performance, as if we had met friends we hadn't seen for many years, which is truly exciting.

I think the songs performed by the Beijing Military Region delegation, such as "The August 1st Military Flag Fluttering in the Wind," the Nanjing Military Region delegation's "Hold High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought," and the Air Force delegation's "Grip the Gun Tightly" and "Everyone a Soldier" are all very good marching songs. These songs are short, concise, powerful, and inspiring. They are excellent songs worthy of promotion.

In addition to those soul-stirring marching songs, we also heard other forms of songs, including poetic and lyrical songs, solemn and magnificent choruses, light and lively humorous ditties, and dramatic song performances. These songs have a strong sense of life and reflect all aspects of military life: some praise the glorious history, some sing about training life, some inspire combat, some reflect labor and construction, some express the relationship between officers and soldiers, and some sing about the unity between the army and the people. Not only are the program contents rich and diverse, but most of them also use popular folk art forms. The song "General and Nurse" was adapted using Shanghai Opera and Xiju opera tunes. "Ten-Man Bridge" used Suzhou Pingtan adapted into a chorus to express the spirit of the troops. Du Fangmo's performance of "Singing the Five-Good Company" adopted the tune of the Hubei folk song "New Dragon Boat," with the addition of some allegro sections, making it even more lively and vivid with singing and acting. The Wuhan Military Region delegation's female chorus singing Henan Opera was simple and beautiful. From these examples, we can see that the diversity of amateur music activities in the company is inseparable from the widespread use of folk art forms.

In recent years, instrumental performance has also developed greatly in the army. Not only are there inherent folk forms like suona opera, but also many instrumental works have been created to express new life. The "East China Sea Fishermen's Song" performed by the Nanjing Military Region delegation was unanimously praised. It created a vivid musical image. The music led the audience into a poetic realm. People seemed to see the undulating sea surface, teams of fishing boats raising their white sails, and fishermen casting thousands of fishing nets in the songs of labor. The songs echoed the sea waves, and the sea was filled with a scene of labor and harvest. A beautiful and moving picture was deeply imprinted in our minds. The composer has rich life experiences, romantic imagination, high skills, and organizational ability.

The "Battlefield Music" performed by the Lanzhou Military Region delegation took us to the Korean battlefield. The intense atmosphere of life fully demonstrated the brave, tenacious, and optimistic spirit of the Volunteer Army soldiers. Their instruments included a huqin made from artillery shells, an accordion given by the people of the motherland, and a long drum given by the Korean people. What was particularly fresh and interesting was the bottle qin made from wine bottles. It is hard to imagine that these crude instruments could play such beautiful and moving tunes. When they played the last sentence of the "Volunteer Army March," "Defeat the American wolves," the actor playing the bottle qin used an American helmet as a percussion instrument. According to the needs of the music itself, adding percussion instruments here was very appropriate. According to the content of the sentence "Defeat the American wolves," hitting the American head a few times was also very pleasant. This move achieved multiple effects and was truly brilliant.

    民族风格　部队气魄——看部队业余演出有感
    刘兆江
    唱歌是人民军队的光荣传统，在那战斗的年代里，战士们唱着雄壮的战歌走向战场，部队打到那里，那里就有了解放的歌声。这次在首都的舞台上，我们又听到了全军文艺会演的许多精彩的音乐节目，好像遇到了多年不见的朋友，怎能不令人兴奋呢。
    我觉得北京部队代表队演唱的“八一军旗迎风飘”、南京部队代表队演唱的“高举毛泽东思想红旗”、空军代表队演唱的“握紧手中枪”“全民皆兵”等，都是很好的队列歌曲。这些歌短小精悍，雄壮有力，听了以后使人精神奋发，斗志昂扬，是值得推广的优秀歌曲。
    除了那些震撼人心的队列歌曲外，我们还听到了其他形式的歌曲，有诗一样的抒情歌曲，也有庄严雄伟的大合唱；有轻松活泼的诙谐小唱，也有戏剧性的歌表演。这些歌曲有着浓郁的生活气息，反映了部队生活的各个方面；有歌颂光荣历史的，有歌唱练兵生活的，有鼓舞战斗的，有反映劳动建设的，有表现官兵关系的，有歌唱军民团结的。不但节目的内容丰富，形式多样，而且大都运用了人民喜闻乐见的民间艺术形式。有用沪剧、锡剧曲调改编的演唱“将军与护士”，有用苏州评弹改编为合唱表现了部队气魄的“十人桥”，杜方模演唱的“歌唱五好连”采用了湖北民歌“新龙船”的曲调，适当的加了一些快板，连唱带演，更是活泼生动。武汉部队代表队女声小合唱集体唱的河南梆子，朴实动听。从这些例子中可以看出，连队业余音乐活动的多样性，是和广泛地运用民间艺术形式分不开的。
    近几年来，器乐演奏在部队里也有了很大的发展，不但有民间固有的像唢呐吹戏等形式，而且创作了许多表现新生活的器乐作品。南京部队代表队演奏的“东海渔歌”得到大家一致称赞，它创造了鲜明的音乐形象；乐曲把听众引向了诗的意境，人们好像看到了波浪起伏的海面，队队渔船扬起白帆，渔民们在劳动的歌声里，撒下了万张渔网，歌声和海浪呼应着，海上一片劳动丰收的景象，一幅美丽动人的图画，深深地印在我们的脑中。作者有着丰富的生活感受和浪漫主义的想像，有着较高的技巧和组织才能。
    兰州部队代表队演奏的“战地音乐”，把我们带到了朝鲜战场，火辣辣的生活气息，充分地表现出志愿军战士那种勇敢顽强的乐观主义精神。他们的乐器有用炮弹壳做成的胡琴，有祖国人民送给的手风琴和朝鲜人民送给的长鼓。特别使人感到新鲜有趣的是用酒瓶做的瓶琴；很难使人想像，用这些土乐器竟能奏出那么优美动听的曲子。他们在演奏“志愿军战歌”最后一句“打败美国野心狼”时，演奏瓶琴的演员把美国钢盔当打击乐器来敲，按乐曲本身发展的需要来说，这里加上打击乐器非常适当；按“打败美国野心狼”这句词的内容来说，打几下美国脑袋也令人十分痛快，这一手收到了多种效果，实在是高明。
