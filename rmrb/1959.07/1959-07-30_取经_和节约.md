    "Taking the Scriptures" and Thrift
    Cui Zongduo
    When engaging in the campaign for increasing production and practicing economy, I think we should consider the following when spending money: what should be spent, what should not be spent, and what could be spent or not spent; so as to ensure that necessary expenses are reduced to the minimum, unnecessary expenses are resolutely avoided, and expenses that are optional are not incurred.
    As far as I know, one unit received seven or eight groups of "scripture takers" in one or two months. Each group generally consisted of eight or nine people, with the largest group having seventeen people. Some came from Shanghai, some from the Northwest, and some from Changchun, Jinzhou, and Shijiazhuang... If we calculate the travel expenses and time they spent, it's a considerable figure. Taking a group of seventeen people as an example, I heard that the train fare alone cost more than 2,500 yuan. Adding subsidies and other transportation costs, it would not be difficult to exceed the 3,000 yuan mark. What about the time? A round trip would take at least a month.
    "Taking the scriptures" is inherently unobjectionable; it is a good thing, it is to learn from others' strengths and make up for one's own shortcomings to achieve the purpose of improving work. But is such a large-scale, long-distance trip wasteful? Can we obtain the "scriptures" by spending less money or no money? I think we should think about it. There are ways, such as adopting the method of communication, asking the other party to send the materials, which is the best method. If the problem really cannot be solved without sending people, the number of people can be reduced to the bare minimum. It is said that there are also some individuals who focus on "sightseeing in Beijing" and take "scriptures" as a secondary matter, which is even more inappropriate.

    “取经”和节约
    崔宗铎
    搞增产节约，在花钱时我想应当考虑一下：哪是该花的，哪是不该花的，哪是可花可不花的；以便做到该花的也要缩小到最低限度，不该花的坚决不花，可花可不花的不花。
    据我所知，有一个单位在一、两个月内就接待了七、八起“取经”的，每起一般是八、九人，最多的是十七人，有的是来自上海，有的是来自大西北，有的是来自长春、锦州、石家庄……如果算一下他们所花的差旅费和时间，那真是一个可观的数字。以十七人的一组为例，听说光火车费就得花两千五百多元，加上补贴和其他车费，三千元大关恐不难突破。时间呢？一来一往，至少也得一个月。
    “取经”本来是无可厚非的，是好事，是取人之长，补己之短达到提高与改进工作的目的。但这样兴师动众，远道而来，有没有浪费呢？少花钱或不花钱能不能取到“经”呢？我看是应当想一想的，办法也是有的，如采取通信的方式，要对方把材料寄来，就是一个最好的方法。如果真的不去人就不能解决问题的话，也可以把人减到不能再减的程度。据说还有个别的人，以“逛京”为主，“取经”为辅，那就更不该了。
