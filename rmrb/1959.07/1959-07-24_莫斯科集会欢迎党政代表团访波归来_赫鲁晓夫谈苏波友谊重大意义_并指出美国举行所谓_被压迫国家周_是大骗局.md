Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 23rd: According to TASS, the Soviet Party and Government delegation headed by Khrushchev returned to Moscow by plane from Warsaw today.

Welcoming the delegation at Vnukovo Airport were Voroshilov, Ignatov, Kozlov, Kuusinen, Mikoyan, Furtseva, Pospelov, Polyansky, and others.

All circles in Moscow held a mass rally at the Lenin Central Stadium to welcome Khrushchev's return from his visit to Poland. Khrushchev delivered a speech at the mass rally.

Khrushchev said that the delegation saw the Polish people's friendly feelings towards the Soviet people everywhere in Poland. This feeling shows that the Polish people correctly understand the significance of Soviet-Polish friendship. This friendship is beneficial to the people of our two countries, to the entire socialist camp, and to the consolidation of world peace.

Khrushchev said that our shared worldview, based on the revolutionary doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, has produced unity of action and broad, continuous cooperation and mutual assistance in economic, political, and cultural life.

Khrushchev, recalling the past history, pointed out that in the past, there were sometimes very complicated twists and turns between Russia and Poland, which led to tensions in relations and even caused wars. Khrushchev went on to say that now some dark forces in the West are trying to use the dark side of our two countries' past relations to sow discord in our friendship. However, we cannot allow the past to have any impact on our current relationship.

Khrushchev pointed out that in many capitalist countries, the bourgeoisie still uses nationalist slogans to deceive the masses of the people as a means of enslaving the working class. Khrushchev said that only through the joint efforts of the working class and working people in every country, as well as on the international stage, and only through close internationalist ties between the workers of all countries, can the working people escape capitalist enslavement.

Khrushchev stressed that the current relations between Poland and the Soviet Union are certainly friendly, comradely, and of fraternal cooperation. The delegation's visit once again proved this. No disputes occurred, nor could they have occurred, during the negotiations between the party and government delegations of the two countries. On the contrary, the exchange of views led to a further strengthening of mutual understanding.

Referring to the United States' announcement of the so-called "Captive Nations Week," Khrushchev pointed out that, out of fear of the increasingly significant achievements of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, the American imperialists and monopoly capitalists have resorted to such crude practices, which can only be described as direct interference in our internal affairs and the most blatant disregard for the sovereign and independent countries that, like the United States, are members of the United Nations.

Khrushchev pointed out that the holding of such a "week" at a time when the international situation is easing and when there are prospects for improvement in Soviet-American relations shows, first and foremost, that certain people are not acting rationally.

Khrushchev said that the monopoly capitalists want to use these means to deceive the people and confuse them. However, this will never be achieved.

Khrushchev went on to say that the panic of the monopoly capitalists can be seen in the hysterical movement in the United States. The anti-socialist movement they stirred up on the eve of US Vice President Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union will not bring them any benefits. Khrushchev said that sensible people in the United States call this movement one of the most deceptive schemes ever undertaken by the leaders of American foreign policy.

Khrushchev said that the imperialists have an understanding of the "liberation of enslaved nations" that is completely contrary to the essence of genuine liberation.

Khrushchev stressed that while repelling the shameless slanders aimed at opposing the truly free, independent, and sovereign socialist countries, we cannot be intimidated by imperialist provocations. We will continue to unswervingly pursue a policy of peace and a policy of supporting the people of all countries who are fighting for freedom. We have always warned the imperialist gentlemen: our socialist camp is strong and indestructible. We openly declare: your aims will never be achieved. The Soviet Union and all socialist countries will confidently and steadfastly follow their own path towards great goals, and will persistently seek a relaxation of international tensions. We have every reason to say that the socialist camp is unprecedentedly united and strong.

Referring to US Vice President Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union, Khrushchev said that we will give Mr. Nixon every opportunity to meet and talk with anyone he wants, anywhere he wants. Let him hear what the Soviet people are saying, and let him understand what our people are thinking.

    莫斯科集会欢迎党政代表团访波归来
    赫鲁晓夫谈苏波友谊重大意义
    并指出美国举行所谓“被压迫国家周”是大骗局
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联党政代表团，今天乘飞机由华沙回到莫斯科。
    在伏努科夫机场上欢迎代表团的有伏罗希洛夫、伊格纳托夫、科兹洛夫、库西宁、米高扬、福尔采娃、波斯别洛夫、波利扬斯基等人。
    莫斯科各界为赫鲁晓夫访问波兰归来在列宁中央运动场举行了群众大会。赫鲁晓夫在群众大会上发表了演说。
    赫鲁晓夫说，代表团在波兰到处看到了波兰人民对苏联人民的友好感情。这种感情表明，波兰人民正确地理解到波苏友谊的意义。这一友谊对我们两国人民、对整个社会主义阵营、对巩固世界和平是有益的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们之间的以革命的马克思列宁主义学说为基础的世界观的一致，产生了行动的一致，产生了在经济、政治和文化生活各方面的广泛、经常的合作和互助。
    赫鲁晓夫回顾了过去的历史时指出，过去，俄国和波兰之间有时发生十分复杂的波折，这些波折曾经导致双方关系的紧张，甚至造成了战争。赫鲁晓夫接着说，现在在西方有些黑暗势力企图利用我们两国过去相互关系中的阴暗面来离间我们的友谊。但是，我们不能允许过去的事情对我们现在的相互关系发生丝毫的影响。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在许多资本主义国家，资产阶级至今仍然用民族主义的口号欺骗人民群众，作为奴役工人阶级的手段。赫鲁晓夫说，只有每一个国家以及国际范围内的工人阶级和劳动人民共同努力，只有各国工人密切的国际主义联系才能使劳动人民摆脱资本主义的奴役。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，目前波兰和苏联之间的关系肯定是友好的、同志式的和兄弟合作的关系。代表团的访问再一次证明了这一点。两国党政代表团在谈判的过程中没有、也不可能发生争论，相反，交换意见的结果导致了彼此了解的进一步加强。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到美国宣布举行所谓“被压迫国家周”时指出，由于害怕苏联和所有社会主义国家取得日益重大的成就，美国帝国主义和垄断资本家竟采取这样粗暴的做法，这些做法只能说是对我们内政的直接干涉，是对同美国一样是联合国会员国的一些主权独立国家采取的最无礼的态度。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，正当国际局势有所缓和的时候，正当苏美关系中呈现出改善的前景的时候，举行这样一个“周”，这首先说明某些人士不是根据理智行事。
    赫鲁晓夫说，垄断资本家想用这些手段来欺骗人民，迷惑他们。但是，这是永远也达不到的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，在美国的歇斯底里运动中可以看出垄断资本家的惊慌失措。他们在美国副总统尼克松访苏前夕挑起的反社会主义运动不会给他们带来任何好处。赫鲁晓夫说，在美国，懂事的人把这次运动称为美国外交政策领导人所干的欺骗性最大的勾当之一。
    赫鲁晓夫说，帝国主义者对“被奴役国家的解放”做了同真正解放的实质完全相反的理解。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，在反击目的在于反对真正自由、独立和主权的社会主义国家的无耻诽谤的同时，我们不能被帝国主义的挑衅所吓倒，我们将继续坚持不懈地执行和平政策、对为自由而斗争的各国人民给予支持的政策。我们一向正告帝国主义老爷们：我们社会主义阵营是强有力的，是不可摧毁的。我们公开地声明：你们的目的是永远达不到的。苏联、所有社会主义国家将满怀信心地坚定不移地沿着自己的道路走向伟大的目标，将坚持不懈地求得国际紧张局势的缓和。我们有一切理由说，社会主义阵营空前地团结和强大。
    在谈到美国副总统尼克松来苏联访问的时候，赫鲁晓夫说，我们将给尼克松先生各种机会，让他在他所愿意的任何地方同任何人会晤和谈话。让他听一听苏联人民在说什么，让他了解到我国人民在想什么。
