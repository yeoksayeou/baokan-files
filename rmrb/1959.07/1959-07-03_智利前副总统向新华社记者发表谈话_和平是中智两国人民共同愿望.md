Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Former Chilean Vice President and World Peace Council member, Betterrecal, told Xinhua reporters today, “The biggest common ground between the people of Chile and China is the demand for peace, and peace is also a matter of concern for the entire Latin American people.”

Betterrecal, who is visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, received reporters from this agency at the Beijing Hotel today. He said excitedly at the beginning, "This visit to China will enable Chile and China to truly start trading with each other" "The prospects for trade development between Chile and China are very broad."

Betterrecal said that Chile is a world-renowned copper and nitrate producing country. Its annual copper production ranks second in the world. Chile can sell these two products to China. However, 90% of Chile's copper production is controlled by the United States. He said: "The people of Chile hope to eliminate the difficulties caused by Western countries not recognizing People's China in developing trade with China."

Betterrecal said: "In addition to developing trade relations between China and Chile, it is also important to carry out cultural exchanges between the two countries."

After returning to his country, he will promote the exchange of students between the two countries and make Chinese newsreels, documentaries and feature films available in Chile as soon as possible to introduce China's Great Leap Forward.

Betterrecal and his wife have visited Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, and will visit the Northeast in the near future. When talking about his impressions of this visit, Betterrecal said: "I have only been in China for more than 20 days. I cannot say that I have a deep understanding of China, but I can still say that my wife and I have gained a deep impression from visiting China. I have seen the optimism of the Chinese people. They are full of trust in their leaders and full of confidence in the future." "I believe that with year after year of the Great Leap Forward, the lives of the Chinese people will continue to improve."

    智利前副总统向新华社记者发表谈话
    和平是中智两国人民共同愿望
    新华社2日讯　智利前副总统、世界和平理事会理事贝特雷加尔今天对新华社记者说：“智利和中国两国人民间最大的共同点就是要求和平，和平也是整个拉丁美洲人民关心的事情”。
    应中国人民外交学会邀请正在我国访问的贝特雷加尔今天在北京饭店接待了本社记者。他一开始便兴奋地说：“这次访问中国能使智利和中国之间真正互相开始贸易”“智利和中国发展贸易的前景非常广阔”。
    贝特雷加尔说，智利是世界上著名的产铜和产硝石的国家，铜的年产量占居世界第二位，智利可以向中国销售这两种产品。但是智利的铜生产有90％操纵在美国手里。他说：“智利全国人民都希望消除因西方国家不承认人民中国而在开展与中国贸易中所引起的困难”。
    贝特雷加尔说：“除了发展智中两国间的贸易关系外，开展两国间的文化交流也很重要”。
    他回国以后将促使两国互派留学生，尽早使中国的新闻片、纪录片和故事片能在智利上演，以介绍中国的跃进情况。
    贝特雷加尔和他的夫人已经参观访问了北京、上海和杭州，最近还将去东北访问。在谈到他这次访问的观感时，贝特雷加尔说：“我在中国才只二十多天，我不能说我对中国已有了深刻的了解，但是我还是能够说，我和我的夫人访问中国已经得到了深刻的印象。我看到了中国人民的乐观情绪，他们对自己的领袖充满信任，对未来充满信心”“我相信经过一年又一年的跃进，中国人民的生活会不断得到改善”。
