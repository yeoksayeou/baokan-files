	Chum Salmon Relocate to Freshwater
	This spring, the Liaoning Provincial Freshwater Aquatic Science Research Institute moved 30,000 chum salmon fry from the Raohe Aquatic Experiment Station on the banks of the Ussuri River in Heilongjiang Province and released them into the Enshanling Breeding Farm of the Qiaotou People's Commune in Benxi County. Thanks to the careful research and breeding by the breeders, who based their work on the fish's living habits, these fry are now growing rapidly in the ponds.
	Chum salmon are born in rivers (laying eggs and hatching) and grow up in the deep sea (young fish return to the sea to grow). They prefer living in low-temperature environments, and are known as "ocean anadromous fish." Raising this type of fish in freshwater is unprecedented.

    大马哈鱼迁居淡水
    辽宁省淡水水产科学研究所今年春天从黑龙江省的乌苏里江畔饶河水产试验站，移来三万尾大马哈鱼苗，放养在本溪县桥头人民公社恩山岭养殖场。由于饲养人员根据它的生活习性精心研究饲养，现在这批鱼苗在池塘里成长得很快。
    大马哈鱼生在江里（产卵、孵化），成长在深海里（幼鱼回到海里成长），喜居于低温环境，人们称它为“海洋洄归性鱼类”。这种鱼在淡水中饲养还是从来未有过的事情。
