    Learn to Grasp the "Living Soul"
    Yi Qing

    The living soul of Marxism lies in: concretely analyzing concrete situations. The Wushi Commune Party organization, in its work, precisely grasped this "living soul." When implementing instructions, resolutions, and task assignments from higher authorities, they always first conduct investigation and research, and analyze specific situations. Once they discover discrepancies between the original plan and the actual situation, they modify and supplement it according to the actual situation, so that their subjective wishes can conform to objective reality. Because they proceed from reality, their production work has been carried out vibrantly and effectively.

    Starting from reality is the dialectical materialist working method. Any identical things, of course, have their common aspects, but they also have their special aspects. Provinces and provinces, counties and counties, communes and communes, production teams and production teams, production groups and production groups, this piece of land and that piece of land, from the perspective of general laws of production and work, have much in common. However, because the specific conditions of each specific work in different regions and departments are different, it is impossible not to have differences. Moreover, objective reality is constantly changing and complex, so the development of each task cannot be the same. Therefore, higher-level leading organs can only identify issues, situations, experiences, and lessons with universal guiding significance, that is, commonalities, from various production and work units, and formulate instructions, resolutions, and plans. It is impossible to stipulate every specific detail of every task in every place so finely that it may restrict the flexibility of lower-level organs in implementation. Therefore, when grassroots Party organizations implement the instructions, resolutions, and plans of higher authorities, they must carefully conduct repeated research based on the specific circumstances, find specific conditions in their own regions from the general laws, and the development of the situation, prescribe the right medicine, and act according to the time and place, and according to the weather and the land. Otherwise, if the particularities of the local and current situation are not found from the universality, it may become uniform, mechanically applied, and good things may be turned into bad things.

    The basic experience of Wushi Commune in proceeding from reality is to go deep into the masses, listen to various opinions of different people; investigate and research, and analyze the situation. This experience is already well known, but when implemented specifically, shortcomings of varying degrees will appear. Therefore, "old words" are repeated to attract attention, to learn to master and apply the "living soul" of Marxism in practice, to concretely analyze concrete situations, to truly "come from the masses and go to the masses," and to truly make subjective wishes conform to objective reality, in order to do a good job and promote production.

    学会抓“活的灵魂”
    怡清
    马克思主义的活的灵魂就在于：具体地分析具体情况。乌石公社党组织在工作当中，正是抓住了这一“活的灵魂”。他们在执行上级指示、决议、布置任务的时候，总是首先进行调查研究，分析具体情况。他们一经发现原计划和实际情况有不相符合的地方，便根据实际情况进行修改补充，使自己的主观愿望能符合客观实际。由于他们从实际出发，所以，他们的生产工作就作得有声有色。
    从实际出发，就是辩证唯物主义的工作方法。任何相同的事物，固然有他共同性的一面，但是，也有他特殊性的一面。省与省、县与县、公社与公社、生产队与生产队、生产小组与生产小组、这块土地和那块土地，从总的生产和工作的规律来说，有许多是共同的。但是，每项具体工作，由于各地各部门的具体条件不同，因之就不可能没有差异。何况客观实际千变万化，错综复杂，各项工作的发展就不可能都是一样。所以，上级领导机关只能从各个不同的生产、工作单位，找出带有普遍指导意义的、也就是共同性的问题、情况、经验、教训，制订出指示、决议和计划，而不可能对每一个地方、每一项工作的每一个具体细节，都规定得很细，以致有可能限制下级机关在执行中的灵活性。因此，基层党组织在执行上级的指示、决议和计划时，就要根据具体情况，认真地作反复研究，从普遍的规律中找出针对自己地区的具体的条件，形势发展，对症下药，做到因时因地制宜，看天看地行事。否则，如果不从普遍性里找出当地当时的特殊性来，就有可能弄得千篇一律，生搬硬套，把好事也办成坏事。
    乌石公社从实际出发的基本经验是，深入群众，听取各种人的各种不同意见；调查研究，分析情况。这个经验已是尽人皆知的了，但具体实行起来，就会出现程度不等的缺点。所以，“老话”重提，引起注意，在实际中学会掌握和运用马克思主义的“活的灵魂”，具体地分析具体情况，真正“从群众中来到群众中去”，真正使主观愿望同客观实际相符合，以便作好工作，推进生产。
