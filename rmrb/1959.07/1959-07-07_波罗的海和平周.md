Baltic Sea Peace Week

　　The Baltic Sea is part of the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Soviet Union, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, West Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and other countries. Norway, in the western part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, also has close ties with the Baltic Sea due to its geographical proximity.

　　During the Second World War, many countries along the Baltic Sea coast were ravaged by fascist Germany. The people of these countries strongly demanded peace and opposed wars of aggression.

　　In September 1957, the government of the German Democratic Republic proposed to the countries bordering the Baltic Sea and Norway that it was necessary for the Baltic Sea countries to hold negotiations, conclude bilateral or multilateral treaties of non-aggression, agreements on cultural and trade cooperation, and declare their determination to safeguard and strengthen peace in the Baltic Sea. From July 5th to 13th, 1958, the "Baltic Sea Peace Week" was held in Rostock according to the decision of the government of the German Democratic Republic. About 80,000 representatives from the two Germanys, the Soviet Union, Poland, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland participated in the Peace Week, and a congress of workers' representatives from the Baltic Sea countries was also held. The conference decided to establish a standing committee responsible for preparing for the annual "Baltic Sea Peace Week." This year's "Baltic Sea Peace Week," which began on June 27th, is the second gathering for peace of the Baltic Sea countries held according to last year's decision. (Bai)

    第二次世界大战期间，波罗的海沿岸的许多国家，曾经遭到法西斯德国的蹂躏。这些国家的人民强烈地要求和平，反对侵略战争。
    1957年9月，德意志民主共和国政府向波罗的海沿岸国家和挪威提的建议，认为波罗的海国家有必要进行谈判，缔结双边或多边的互不侵犯条约、文化和贸易合作协定以及宣布它们决心维护和加强波罗的海和平。1958年7月5日至13日，根据德意志民主共和国政府的决定，在罗斯托克举行了“波罗的海和平周”。参加和平周的有来自两个德国、苏联、波兰、芬兰、瑞典、挪威、丹麦和冰岛等国的代表约八万人，还举行了波罗的海岸国家工人代表大会。大会决定成立常设委员会，负责每年筹备举行“波罗的海和平周”。今年从6月27日开始举行的“波罗的海和平周”是根据去年的决定而举行的第二届波罗的海沿岸国家的和平的集会。（白）
