    Immediately Release Glezos!
    Liu Jingxi, Vice President of Beijing University of Political Science and Law
    We were extremely indignant to hear the news that the Greek authorities had sent Manolis Glezos, the leader of the Greek United Democratic Left, to a military court for trial!
    The Greek authorities' accusations and trial of Glezos are completely illegal. The law they are relying on is the notorious so-called Law 375, a fascist law passed during the dictatorship. The "espionage" charges they have imposed on Glezos are complete fabrications and slanders. As everyone knows, Glezos is a Greek national hero and an outstanding peace fighter. During the Nazi occupation, he bravely and cleverly climbed the heavily guarded Acropolis of Athens, tore down the filthy swastika flag, and raised the Greek national flag, greatly inspiring the Greek people's anti-fascist struggle. After the war, Glezos, together with the progressive forces of the country, has consistently and tirelessly waged an unyielding struggle for world peace and for Greece's national independence and democratic freedom. It is precisely for this reason that he has been warmly loved by the broad masses of the people. It is also for this reason that he is hated, slandered, and persecuted by US imperialism and the reactionary Greek rulers. Loving the motherland and loving peace is "espionage" and "treason," and this is the "law" on which these reactionaries base their actions!
    For more than ten years after the war, Glezos has been subjected to illegal persecution and imprisoned twelve times. Now, just as the wave of Greek people opposing the establishment of US rocket bases and other reactionary measures on their territory is rising, the Greek authorities are intensifying their persecution of Glezos, attempting to murder this national hero through a military trial. This is yet another frenzied attack on the entire Greek patriotic and democratic forces, attempting to intimidate the Greek people who are fighting for peace and freedom and force them to endure slavery and plunder under the US-made "swastika flag."
    However, this reactionary conspiracy will never succeed, and violence cannot suppress the people's pursuit of truth. The real defendants are not Glezos, but this small group of reactionary rulers who have turned to US imperialism and sold out national interests. History and the people are the fairest judges.
    We, the workers in political science and law, together with the people of the whole country and all peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world, resolutely protest against this illegal persecution of Glezos and other patriots, and solemnly declare: Do not kill Glezos, immediately restore Glezos' freedom!

    立即释放格列索斯！
    北京政法学院副院长　刘镜西
    我们在听到希腊当局把希腊统一民主左翼党领袖格列索斯送交军事法庭审讯的消息后，感到极大的愤慨！
    希腊当局对格列索斯的控诉和审讯是完全非法的。他们所依据的法律就是那臭名昭彰的所谓三百七十五号法律，这是在独裁统治时期通过的法西斯法律。他们所强加在格列索斯头上的“间谍”罪名，是彻头彻尾的捏造和诬告。大家知道，格列索斯是希腊的民族英雄、杰出的和平战士。在纳粹占领期间，他曾英勇而机智地爬上戒备森严的雅典城堡，扯下肮脏的卐字旗，升起希腊民族的旗帜，大大鼓舞了希腊人民反法西斯斗争的情绪。战后，格列索斯又和全国的进步力量一起，始终不懈地为世界和平为希腊的民族独立和民主自由进行了不屈不挠的斗争。正因为这样，他得到了广大人民的热烈爱戴。也正因为这样，他为美帝国主义和希腊反动统治者所痛恨、所诬陷、所迫害。爱祖国、爱和平，是“间谍活动”是“叛国行为”，这就是这些反动派所根据的“法律”！
    战后十多年来，格列索斯一直在受到非法迫害、被监禁了十二次。现在，正当希腊人民反对在自己的领土上设置美国的火箭基地及其他各种反动措施的浪潮日益高涨的时候、希腊当局变本加厉地迫害格列索斯，企图通过军事审判来谋害这位民族英雄，这是对整个希腊爱国民主力量的又一次疯狂的进攻，妄图以此来恐吓为和平自由而斗争的希腊人民、迫使人民在美制的“卐字旗”下忍受奴役和掠夺。
    但是，这种反动阴谋是永远不能得逞的，暴力镇压不了人民对真理的追求。真正的被告不是格列索斯，而是这一小撮投靠美帝国主义、出卖民族利益的反动统治者。历史和人民就是最公正的审判者。
    我们政法工作者同全国人民及世界上一切爱好和平自由的人民一起，坚决抗议这种对格列索斯和其他爱国者的非法迫害，并严正声明：不准杀害格列索斯，立即恢复格列索斯的自由！
