Glossary of Terms

	Equipment Capacity
	Equipment capacity refers to the quantity marked on the nameplate of electrical equipment. It represents the working capacity that the electrical equipment can bear during normal operation. For example, motors often use horsepower or kilowatts as the unit of capacity, while transformers use kilovolt-amperes, etc.

	Electricity Consumption
	Electricity consumption is the standard for calculating the amount of electricity used. The commonly used unit of calculation is "kilowatt-hour," commonly known as "degree" (or "unit"). Ten 50-watt light bulbs used for two hours consume one "degree" of electricity, and a one-horsepower motor used for 1.36 hours also consumes one "degree" of electricity.

    名词解释
      设备容量
    设备容量是指电器设备铭牌上所标志的量，就是这个电器设备在正常运行时所能负担的工作能力，如电机多采用马力或瓩作容量单位，变压器则采用千伏安作容量单位等。
      用电量
    用电量是计算电力使用数量的标准。常用的计算单位是“瓩小时”，通俗称为“度”，五十瓦灯泡十盏用两小时就要用一“度”电，一马力电动机使用一点三六小时也要用一“度”电。
