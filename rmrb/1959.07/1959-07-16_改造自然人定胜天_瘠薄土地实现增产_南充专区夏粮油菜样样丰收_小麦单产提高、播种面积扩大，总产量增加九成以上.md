    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 15th. The Nanchong region in northern Sichuan, known for its barren land, has achieved an all-round bumper harvest of summer crops this year. The total output of the region's 4,240,000 mu of summer grain crops, mainly wheat, increased by more than 45% compared to last year. Among them, the average yield per mu of more than 2,523,800 mu of wheat increased by more than 70% compared to last year; the yield per mu of broad beans, peas, barley, and other summer small miscellaneous grain crops increased by 30% to more than double compared to last year, respectively. Due to the increase in wheat yield per mu and the expansion of the planting area, the total wheat output in the region increased by more than 90% compared to last year. In addition, rapeseed also achieved a bumper harvest. The average yield per mu of the region's more than 365,000 mu of rapeseed increased by more than 40% compared to last year.
    The overall bumper harvest and growth rate of summer grain crops in the region this year are unprecedented. All twelve counties (cities) in the region achieved bumper harvests, and all crops yielded abundantly. Large areas of high-yield fields, thousands upon thousands of mu in size, appeared in plains, hills, and mountainous areas. Broad beans and peas, which have always been considered low-yield crops, have also achieved large-scale high-yield production in some communes and teams this year. The 1,296 mu of peas in Jingxi Commune, Guang'an County, averaged 690 jin per mu.
    The overall bumper harvest in the Nanchong region is the result of a series of arduous struggles by the people of the region, under the leadership of the Party, to transform nature. The vast majority of the region's cultivated land is hilly and mountainous, with steep slopes, barren soil, and poor water and fertilizer retention. In order to strive for a large-scale bumper harvest, during last year's winter planting season, combined with deep plowing of wheat fields, the region launched a mass movement to improve the soil and build terraced fields, improving the soil of more than 1.2 million mu of cultivated land and building terraced fields. Since the beginning of spring, the region has been hit by six or seven wind and rain disasters, causing many wheat plants to lodge. Farmers in various counties, in those days of wind and rain, took various measures, day and night, to rescue the lodged wheat, and also took preventive measures against wheat with a tendency to lodge. Along with the wind and rain disasters, wheat aphids, red spiders, rust, and diseases and pests of peas and broad beans appeared in the region. Each county immediately organized tens of thousands of people into "medical teams," taking production teams as units, dividing up areas of responsibility, carrying out blitzkriegs, and thoroughly stopping the diseases and pests, ensuring the bumper harvest.
    The secretaries of Party committees at all levels taking the lead, grasping ideology and key points, using high-yield areas to drive large areas, and implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in a manner suited to local conditions are the main experiences of the region in achieving a major summer harvest. Party committee leaders at the regional, county, and commune levels, respectively, combined with technical cadres and members to plant command fields on a large scale, participate in production and lead production, set examples, and guide the overall situation. Cadres at all levels have their own responsibility areas and responsibility fields, and all communes have also established field management systems, dividing into areas and groups, managing everything from planting to harvesting.
    Now, inspired by the major summer harvest, the broad masses in the region are summarizing the experience of high yield, promoting autumn with summer, strengthening the field management of crops such as rice and cotton, actively increasing the planting of intercrops and late autumn crops, expanding the planting area, further developing the diversified economy of the commune, and striving for an all-round bumper harvest in autumn agricultural and sideline production as well.

    改造自然人定胜天　瘠薄土地实现增产
    南充专区夏粮油菜样样丰收
    小麦单产提高、播种面积扩大，总产量增加九成以上
    据新华社成都15日电　四川北部土地瘠薄的南充专区，今年夏熟作物获得全面大丰收。全区四百二十四万亩以小麦为主的夏收粮食作物，总产量比去年增长四成半以上。其中二百五十二万三千八百多亩小麦，平均亩产量比去年增长七成多；蚕豆、豌豆、大麦和其他夏收小杂粮作物的亩产量，分别比去年增长三成到一倍以上。由于小麦亩产量的提高和种植面积的扩大，全区小麦总产量比去年增加九成以上。此外，油菜籽也获得大丰收，全区三十六万五千多亩油菜，平均亩产量比去年提高了四成多。
    今年全区夏粮作物全面大丰收和增长的速度，是史无前例的。全区十二个县（市）个个丰收，样样作物丰产，无论平坝、丘陵或山区，都出现了整沟、整坝，成千上万亩的大面积丰产田。一向被认为是低产作物的蚕豆、豌豆，今年有些社队也获得了大面积高额丰产。广安县井溪公社一千二百九十六亩豌豆，平均亩产六百九十斤。
    南充专区全面大丰收，是全区人民在党的领导下向大自然进行一系列艰苦斗争后取得的。全区耕地绝大部分都是丘陵地和山地，坡度大，土质瘠薄，保水保肥力差。为了力争大面积丰收，去年冬种时，结合麦地深耕，全区掀起了一个群众性的改良土壤和修建梯田运动，使一百二十多万亩耕地的土壤得到改良和修成了梯田。入春以来，全区又遭受了六七次风雨灾害的袭击，许多小麦倒伏，各县农民在那些风雨交加的日子里，不分白天黑夜，采取各种办法，抢救倒伏的小麦，对有倒伏趋势的小麦也采取了预防措施。伴随着风灾雨害，全区又出现了小麦蚜虫、红蜘蛛、锈病和豌、蚕豆的病虫害，各县立即以生产队为单位，组织了数万人的“医疗队”，分片包干，突击围歼，彻底制止了病虫害，保住了丰收。
    各级党委书记挂帅，抓思想抓关键，以丰产片带动大面积，因地制宜地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，是全区取得夏季大丰收的主要经验。专区、县、公社各级党委领导人，都分别和技术干部、社员结合，大种指挥田，参加生产领导生产，做出榜样，指导全面。各级干部都有自己的责任区、责任田，各公社也都建立了田间管理制度，分片划组，从种到收，一管到底。
    现在全区广大群众在夏季大丰收的鼓舞下，正总结丰产经验，以夏促秋，加强水稻、棉花等作物的田间管理，积极增种间种晚秋作物，扩大种植面积，进一步发展公社多种经济，争取秋季农副业生产也获得全面大丰收。
