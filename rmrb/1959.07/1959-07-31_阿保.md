A’bao
Ma Zhenhua
On Changtu Island, people affectionately call him "A’bao" and consult him about matters of the commune and their families.
He is familiar with Changtu, loves Changtu, and has deeply rooted himself in Changtu.
Is he a cadre of the commune? No! Is he a native of Changtu? No! Who is he then…

I landed on Changtu Island and immediately encountered a local cadre. His left eye was covered with gauze, as if he had an eye disease. He wore a patched-up old uniform and carried a pair of baskets, as if he were delivering grain to the canteen. He looked at me when he heard me asking for directions and said, "Going to the Fourth Company? Come on, I'll lead you there!"

Everyone knows that the relationship between the army and the people is good on Changtu Island, especially in the Fourth Company, which was awarded a collective Second Class Merit last year for its exemplary army-people unity. It seemed this guide was very familiar with the troops. He must know something about it. I planned to get some background information from him, so I chatted with him as we walked.

Before I could say more than a few words, an old woman stopped us.

"A’bao, put it down and rest!" She took a towel to wipe the sweat off my guide's face and complained, "This child just doesn't listen. How can his eyes withstand so many sleepless nights!" As soon as A’bao put down his load, several young women ran over:

"A’bao, what's wrong with your eyes!"

"Hehe, his eyes are blind, so he can be a fortune teller!" They looked at him with concern, laughing and joking. A young woman snatched the load from A’bao and said to another girl:

"A’Xiu, you take A’bao to the canteen, I need to talk to A’bao about something!"

"What is it?" A’bao looked at me, as if afraid I was in a hurry, and said to the woman, "Is it about the accounts? We worked on it for several nights and cleared it up already!"

"No," the woman said anxiously, "The canteen's building hasn't been repaired yet, and the glass hasn't been bought. You have to think of something!" As she spoke, she squatted down on the side of the road, drawing a picture of the canteen window on the ground. A’bao also squatted down, gesturing and studying it. I couldn't make heads or tails of it, so I sat down to rest. At this time, the sun was setting, and the evening glow illuminated the lush green island, making it look very beautiful.

After A’bao finished talking to the woman, we continued on our way. We rounded a bend, crossed a small bridge, and arrived at the gate of an elementary school. The students were just being dismissed and, seeing us coming, they all gathered around A’bao, saying, "Uncle A’bao, what's wrong with your eyes! Come to my house, Uncle the medic from Da Jun's is running a hospital at my house!" A’bao was surrounded by the children, patting one, hugging another, constantly saying, "It's okay, Uncle's eyes will be fine tomorrow, and he'll come to watch you play ball!" After this lively scene, another quarter of an hour passed.

I was very anxious, as I would miss dinner if I got to the company late, which would be troublesome! Seeing A’bao sending the elementary school students away, I thought we should hurry. But then, an old man carrying fishing nets approached. He was carrying a load of cooked fishing nets, moving his feet with difficulty. A’bao hurried up, grabbed the load, and said, "Grandpa Gui Lin, give it to me, let's go together!" Without waiting for the old man to speak, he turned to me and said, "It's not much further, just a detour to the fishing team, and then we'll be at the Fourth Company."

Along the way, I heard many more people calling A’bao’s name. A’bao responded, greeting them, and carrying the fishing nets briskly. At the fishing cooperative, he was stopped by the director and the accountant for a while before he finally led me on my way. By this time, the sun had long set, and the lights of the fishing boats were already twinkling on the sea. However, although the time was delayed, I was very satisfied with this cadre. His style of connecting with the masses and his close relationship with the masses deeply moved me!

When we arrived at the company headquarters, I explained my purpose to the political instructor. I wanted to invite A’bao to dinner, but he was nowhere to be found. I asked the political instructor if he knew him, and the political instructor said, "How could I not know him? He's our Fifth Platoon Leader!"

"What? Your Fifth Platoon Leader?"

"Yes! Our Fifth Platoon Leader, Wang Anbao!"

"What? He's not a local cadre?"

"No! He's our second lieutenant platoon leader, sent down to work in the commune!"

The political instructor saw that I was stunned, so he simply told me the story.

In early 1951, a small reconnaissance squad, codenamed "Jianyang Seventh Squad," first set foot on this desolate island. Among them was a stout Shandong reconnaissance man named Wang Anbao. When he first arrived, the locals didn't understand his Shandong dialect and laughed behind his back; he couldn't understand their "ala ala" either. He would spend his free time looking at the sea and didn't want to interact with the masses. One night, while Wang Anbao was on guard, he suddenly saw a red glow: the five large rooms of the township office were on fire! Wang Anbao immediately woke up the entire squad and was the first to rush into the burning building, carrying out an old woman. When he rushed in a second time, a large piece of wood collapsed and injured his leg. The next day, almost all the residents of the village came to see him, some bringing eggs, some bringing fresh fish, and some old women even prayed for him in the temple. From then on, the name A’bao, along with the codename "Jianyang Seventh Squad," spread throughout Changtu Island. Wang Anbao began to feel that the people here were as lovely and dear as the people in the old liberated areas, and he gradually began to learn "ala."

"Look," Wang Anbao said to me when I interviewed him, leading me to the dam of the Changxi Reservoir and pointing to the building of the credit cooperative, "That's the original township office. After those five large rooms burned down, we used waste materials to help build these three rooms. After the building was completed, we reorganized into the current Fourth Company. The old comrades-in-arms have all been transferred one after another, leaving only me, for almost nine years now!"

"You've been here for nine years!"

"The time isn't long, but the changes on this island are great!" Wang Anbao pointed to the reservoir in front of us and said, "This was built last year during the Great Leap Forward by us and the people together. That seawall over there, we built that too." He pointed to the elementary school we passed yesterday and said, "When we were building that school, we trained during the day and helped move stones at night, we worked so happily! Later, when we built the barracks, the masses also came to help move stones, no matter how we tried to dissuade them. At that time, our slogan was 'Protect Changtu, unafraid of bloodshed,' and the people's slogan was 'Build Changtu, unafraid of sweating,' and that's how we took root here."

That night, Wang Anbao showed me a poem he had recently written. The title of the poem was "Changtu is My Home":

"I've been on the island for nine years,
Participated in the construction of the island with my own hands,
How great the changes on the island are,
All this makes me reluctant to leave, makes me attached.
Changtu is my home, the people are my support,
To protect Changtu, to build Changtu,
I am willing to shed all my blood and sweat!"

I read this poem several times. Its strong emotion of loving the island deeply infected me. I said to Wang Anbao, "Your idea of 'taking the island as your home' is really clear!"

He smiled: "The other day you mistook me for a local cadre, but even I myself sometimes can't tell the difference. The company is my home, and the commune is also my home. Come back and take a look in a few years! By then, Changtu will become even more prosperous and beautiful!"

On our long coastline, how many such loyal and devoted good soldiers are there who take the island as their home! (Attached image)

    阿保
    马真划
    在长涂岛上，人们都亲热地叫他“阿保”，同他商量社里和家里的事情；
    他熟悉长涂，热爱长涂，在长涂深深地扎下了根；
    他是公社的干部吗？不！他是长涂人吗？也不！他是谁呢……
    我登上长涂岛，就碰到一个地方干部。他的左眼蒙着一块纱布，像害着眼病，身上穿着一件打了补丁的旧制服，挑着一对箩筐，像是往食堂送粮食的。他听我在问路，看了看我，说：“到四连？走，我领你去！”
    长涂岛的军民关系好，这是谁都知道的，尤其是四连，去年还因为军民团结好，立过集体二等功。看来这位向导，跟部队也很熟。这样的事，他一定知道。我打算从他这里了解点侧面材料，就一面走一面跟他闲谈。
    还没说上两句，一个老大娘拦住了我们的去路。
    “阿保，放下歇歇！”她拿块手巾给我的向导擦汗，还埋怨地说：“这孩子就是不听话，连熬好几夜，什么眼睛能抗得了！”阿保刚放下担子，几个青年妇女又跑过来：
    “阿保，你眼睛怎么啦！”
      “嘻嘻，眼睛瞎啦，好当算命先生啦！”她们关心地看着，嘻嘻哈哈地笑着。一个青年妇女从阿保手里夺过担子，对另一个姑娘说：
      “阿秀，你给阿保送到食堂，我找阿保谈个事儿！”
      “什么事呵！”阿保看了看我，好像怕我着急似的，又对这个妇女说：“是不是算账的事？我们搞了几个通宵，早算清啦！”
      “不是，”这个妇女着急地说：“食堂的房子没修好，玻璃还没买来，你得想办法呵！”她一面说，一面在路边蹲下来，在地上画着食堂窗户的图样。阿保也蹲下来，比划着，研究着。我在一旁听不出头绪，就坐下来休息。这时候，太阳快落山了，一片晚霞映照着这个葱绿的海岛，显得非常美丽。
    等阿保和这个妇女谈完了话，我们才继续往前走。拐过一个弯，过了一道小桥，走到一所小学校的门。小学生们正散学，看见我们走过来，就一齐围到阿保跟前说：“阿保叔叔，你眼睛怎么啦！上我家吧，大军的卫生员叔叔在我家开医院哩！”阿保给这一群孩子围着，拍拍这个，抱抱那个，不断地说：“不要紧，叔叔的眼睛明天就好，还来看你们赛球哩！”这么热闹了一阵子，一刻钟又过去了。
    我很着急，到了连队赶不上晚饭，多麻烦！看见阿保打发了小学生，心想这回可该赶快走了。那知道，前面赶来了一个挑渔网的老大爷。他挑着一担煮好了的渔网，费力地挪动着脚步。阿保赶上去一看，扯住担子说：“贵林大爷，给我，咱们一路走！”没等老大爷说话，他转头对我说：“不多走路，到渔业队拐一拐，就到四连。”
    一路上，我又听到不少喊阿保的声音。阿保应着，招呼着，挑着渔网轻快地走着。到了渔业社，又给主任、会计拉住说了一阵子，这才领着我上路。这时候，太阳早落了，海面上已经闪着渔船的灯光。不过，虽然耽误了时间，可是我心里很满意这个干部：他联系群众的作风，他和群众亲密的关系，使我深深地感动！
    到了连部，向指导员说明了来意，正想请阿保一起吃晚饭，却找不见他了。问指导员认不认识他，指导员说：“怎么不认识，这是我们五排长呀！”
    “什么？你们的五排长？”
    “是呀！我们五排长王安保！”
    “怎么？他不是地方干部？”
    “不是！是我们的少尉排长，是下放到社里去工作的！”
    指导员看我楞在那里，就把事情简单地告诉了我。
    1951年初，一支小小的以“建阳七中队”为代号的侦察班，第一次踏上这个荒凉的小岛。这个班里有个粗粗胖胖的山东籍侦察员，名叫王安保。刚来的时候，当地人不懂他的山东话，老在他身后指手划脚地笑他；他也听不惯那些“阿拉阿拉”的，有空就到海边上看海，根本不想接触群众。有一天夜里，王安保正在站岗，忽然看见一片红光：乡公所那五间大房子着火了！王安保立刻叫醒全班，第一个冲进着火的房子，背出了一个老大娘。第二次再冲进去时，一块粗大的木头坍下来，把他的腿打伤了。第二天，几乎全村的居民都来看他，有的拿着鸡蛋，有的拿着鲜鱼，有的老大娘还到庙里为他祈祷。从这以后，阿保这个名字就跟“建阳七中队”这个代号一起，飞遍了长涂岛。王安保开始觉得这儿的人民跟老解放区人民一样可爱可亲，他也就慢慢地学起“阿拉”来了。
      “你看，”我访问王安保的时候，他把我领到长西水库的大坝上指着信用社那幢房子对我说：“那就是原来的乡公所，那五间大房烧了后，我们又用废料帮助盖了这三间房子。房子盖成后，我们改编成现在的第四连。那时的老战友都先后调走了，只剩了我一个人，到现在快九年啦！”
      “你来这里已经九年啦！”
    “时间不算长，可这岛上的变化大啦！”王安保指着我们面前的水库说：“这是去年大跃进时我们和人民群众一起修的。那边的海塘，也是我们修起来的。”他又指着我们昨天经过的那座小学校说：“盖那座学校时，我们白天训练，晚上帮助搬石头，干的可欢哩！后来我们盖营房，群众也来帮助搬石头，怎么劝说也不行。当时我们的口号是‘保卫长涂不怕流血’，人民群众的口号是‘建设长涂不怕流汗’，就这样，我们在这里扎下根了。”
    当天晚上，王安保给我看一首诗，这是他最近写的。诗的题目是“长涂是我家”：
      “我来岛整九年，
    亲手参加了海岛的建设，
    海岛的变化多么大呀，
    这一切使我难舍，使我依恋。
    长涂是我家，人民是靠山，
    为保卫长涂，建设长涂，
    我愿流尽自己的血汗！”
    我把这首诗读了好几遍。它的热爱海岛的感情强烈地感染了我，我对王安保说：“你‘以岛为家’的思想可真明确呵！”
    他笑了笑：“你那天把我当成地方干部，其实连我自己有时也分不清楚。连队是我的家，公社也是我的家。再过几年你再来看看吧！那时候，长涂将变得更加富饶更加美好了！”
    在我们漫长的海防线上，有多少这样忠心耿耿、以岛为家的好战士呵！（附图片）
