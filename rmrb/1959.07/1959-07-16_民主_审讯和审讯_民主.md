“Democratic” Trial and the Trial of “Democracy”
　　Dong Fengya

    Facing the world's people's angry tide of protest against the illegal trial of Glezos, the panicked Greek authorities let their prime minister speak.

    Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis said that the world people’s protest was "international communist interference," and this "interference" was "ignoring the principles of democracy" (Agence France-Presse, Athens, 10th dispatch).

    There is no need to argue with him here about the abuses and slanders of "international communist interference." We would like to see what kind of "democracy" the Greek authorities' trial is.

    Unfortunately, Karamanlis is unwilling to tell us what is in the bun he peddles as a "democratic" trial. We have to cut it open to see it. The following is the trial situation:

    Defense attorney for the defendant asks: What specific proof does the political police bureau have regarding the defendant's espionage activities...?

    Witness for the plaintiff answers: Right, there is no such proof (commotion and laughter in the courtroom).

    Presiding Judge: The witness for the plaintiff can refuse to answer the question because "the members of our military court believe you."

    Defense attorney for the defendant asks: What is the factual basis for Glezos' "accomplice in espionage activities"?

    Witness for the plaintiff answers: It is the political police authorities' conjecture (what a free conjecture, it's simply extremely "democratic").

    Defense attorney for the defendant asks: What is the basis for the political police bureau's insistence that Glezos met with Koryannis?

    Witness for the plaintiff answers: Koryannis "should" meet with Glezos because Glezos is the secretary of the United Democratic Left Party (in this way, the president of the Greek military court "should" execute Glezos because he is the "president," and the witness for the plaintiff "should" fabricate testimony because he is a police officer).

    The "trial" has revealed that the testimony is fabricated; the facts are fictitious; the accusation was originally a frame-up; the arrest was actually illegal; all of this was a premeditated conspiracy by the Greek authorities. The defendant's defense attorney reasonably questioned on what basis the Greek political police bureau was doing these things.

    The presiding judge of the court immediately announced the end of the trial with a red face and a thick neck.

    What a "democratic" trial! However, isn't this precisely the hero's trial of the "democratic" trial? Does this kind of "democratic" crime still need anyone to sentence it?

    As early as eighteen years ago, Hitler had personally sentenced Glezos to death. At that time, didn't they also think they were representatives of "democracy." Moreover, the "democracy" of Hitler's trial was no less inferior to today's trial by the Greek authorities. Anyone who has seen the trial situation of the Greek military court will understand this point. Who in the world has ever given "democracy" to Hitler?

    The Greek authorities do indeed have something superior to Hitler, that is, Hitler did not grasp Glezos in those years, but the Greek authorities have caught him. Therefore, Hitler could only majestically pronounce a piece of empty paper, while the Greek authorities can actually kill him. Hitler, in the afterlife, should be extremely grateful that the Greek authorities can complete his will.

    However, Hitler also avoided the misfortune of being tried in front of the hero because he did not catch Glezos, but the president of the Greek military court and the like of the plaintiff's witnesses had to endure this kind of trial in front of the hero. It is said that this "democratic" trial will continue. Then, the trial of the "democratic" trial will also continue.

    “民主”审讯和审讯“民主”
    董逢亚
    面对着世界人民抗议非法审讯格列索斯的怒潮，惊慌的希腊当局，让它的首相出来说话了。
    希腊首相卡拉曼利斯说世界人民的抗议是“国际共产主义的干涉”，这种“干涉”是“无视民主的原则”（法新社雅典10日电）。
    这里无需同他争辩关于“国际共产主义干涉”的滥言和诬词。我们倒想看看希腊当局的审讯是怎样的“民主”。
    不幸的很，卡拉曼利斯并不肯告诉我们，他兜售的那“民主”审讯的包子里到底装的是什么馅儿。我们只好搿开来看了，下面便是审讯的情况：
    被告辩护人问：政治警察局有什么关于被告进行间谍活动……的具体证明？
    原告证人答：对，没有这些证明（场内骚动、哄笑）。
    庭长：原告证人可以不回答问题，因为“我们军事法庭的成员相信您。”
    被告辩护人问：格列索斯“间谍活动同谋犯”的事实根据是什么？
    原告证人答：是警察当局臆想出来的（多么自由的臆想啊，简直“民主”极了）。
    被告辩护人问：政治警察局硬说格列索斯会见了科里雅尼斯的根据是什么？
    原告证人答：科里雅尼斯“应当”会见格列索斯，因为格列索斯是统一民主左翼党的书记（如此说来，希腊军事法庭庭长“应当”处死格列索斯，因为他是“庭长”，原告证人“应当”捏造证词，因为他是警官）。
      “审讯”已经揭明证词是捏造的；事实是虚构的；控告原是陷害；逮捕实属非法，这一切都是希腊当局预定的阴谋。被告辩护人依理质问希腊政治警察局根据什么权利作这些事情。
    法庭庭长脸红脖子粗地立即宣布本次审讯到此结束。
    这是多么“民主”的审讯呀！然而，这岂不又正是英雄对于“民主”审讯的审讯么？难道这种“民主”的罪行，还用得着什么人再去宣判吗？
    早在十八年前，希特勒就已亲自宣判过格列索斯的死刑了。那时他们何尝不以为自己是“民主”的代表。而且，希特勒审讯的“民主”性，比希腊当局今天的审讯一点也不见得逊色。任何人看了希腊军事法庭的审讯情况，都会明白这一点。世界上谁又曾把“民主”给予过希特勒呢？
    希腊当局的确有比希特勒高明的地方，那就是，希特勒当年未曾握住格列索斯，而希腊当局却把他抓起来了。因此希特勒只能威风地宣判一纸空文，而希腊当局却能实际上把他杀害。希特勒在九泉之下，对于希腊当局能够完成他的遗志，也当是感激不尽的。
    但是，希特勒却也因为没有抓住格列索斯而避免了在英雄面前受审的厄运，而希腊军事法庭的庭长以及原告证人之流，却不得不在英雄面前承受这种审讯了。据说，这“民主”审讯还要进行的。那末，对于“民主”审讯的审讯也将继续进行下去。
