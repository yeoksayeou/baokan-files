Short-Term Rotational Training for Cadres Based on Different Characteristics
Jiangbei Machinery Factory Party Committee Organizes Cadres to Study Culture

(According to a report from the Jilin Daily) The Party Committee of Jilin Jiangbei Machinery Factory, based on the different characteristics of cadres, arranges their studies. For leading cadres above the level of workshop director and veteran technical workers, they adopt the method of short-term, intensive, off-the-job rotational training to organize them to study junior high school cultural courses, which has achieved great results.

Of the factory's existing 112 leading cadres above the level of workshop director, 73% are from old worker backgrounds. Their common characteristics are that they have rich practical production experience, are active and willing to work, and can go deep into reality and integrate with the workers; they are older and have a low level of education (77% have only amateur elementary school or junior high school level one). This greatly limits the improvement of their political theory, business management level, and production technology knowledge. These comrades are the leading backbone of the factory's production, and the success or failure of completing production tasks is directly related to them. They are eager to study, but their busy work schedules, meetings, and social activities make it difficult for them to persist in their studies. In the past, although the Party Committee thought of many ways to promote cultural learning for these cadres, the completion rate of cadres at the end of each semester was at most 20%, while the completion rate of ordinary workers was above 73%.

In order to improve the leadership level of cadres, the Party Committee adopted effective measures and decided, on the premise of not affecting production, to rationally utilize the factory's existing equipment and the teaching staff of the spare-time school. Using the method of half-off-the-job and off-the-job short-term intensive rotational training, they organized all 397 leading cadres above the level of workshop director and veteran technical workers with less than junior high school education to study culture in batches and phases. On August 2, 1957, the first phase of the intensive off-the-job cultural learning class was officially opened, and 27 cadres, including Party branch secretaries, section chiefs, and workshop directors, were selected to participate in the study. It ended on February 10, 1958. During this period, except for regular holidays and two weeks of suspension for rectification and the anti-Rightist struggle, the actual number of teaching days was only more than five months. The basic content of junior high school courses such as Chinese language, geometry, algebra, physics, and chemistry were completed. Of the 27 cadres who participated in the study, except for three who stopped studying halfway due to special circumstances, the remaining 24 all persisted until graduation. Now they have been promoted to amateur high school and amateur secondary professional classes for further study.

The factory Party Committee seriously summarized its experience, and in early May of this year, it opened the second phase and organized 24 people to participate in the study.

Before each selection of cadres for study, the Party Committee carefully adjusted the cadre strength, so that the work performed by the cadres participating in the study was taken over by someone else. At the same time, they repeatedly explained the significance of this approach to the broad masses of workers. The workers strongly supported this approach, and everyone said that not only should production not be affected because cadres participate in the study, but production tasks should also be overfulfilled.

In terms of organization, teaching and administrative work were determined to be the responsibility of the factory's spare-time school office. A Party branch was established in the class to strengthen ideological work and ensure teaching. A class committee was also established to lead the study. Ordinary middle school textbooks were adopted in teaching, with appropriate deletions of unnecessary content to meet the time requirements. According to the systematic nature of the courses themselves, the learning time for the first stage was determined, focusing on algebra, Chinese language, and chemistry; after completing algebra, geometry and physics were taught centrally. When lecturing, in order to suit the characteristics of the cadres, theory was explained in connection with practice. The school required teachers to understand the ideological requirements of the students in depth when preparing lessons, and teachers were able to be intuitive and popular in their lectures. Teachers went to the classroom every day to provide separate tutoring, and extracurricular tutoring was provided at least once a week. Teachers and students held regular forums to exchange opinions and continuously improve teaching methods. In terms of curriculum arrangement, in addition to six classes per day, two hours of review were conducted in the classroom, and half a day of review was also provided every week, so that timely digestion and on-the-spot consolidation were achieved. In order to consolidate the knowledge acquired by the cadres, the Party Committee immediately organized them to be promoted to different classes to continue their studies after they graduated from junior high school.

    根据不同特点短期轮训干部
    江北机械厂党委组织干部学习文化
    据吉林日报消息　吉林江北机械厂党委，根据干部的不同特点，安排干部的学习，对车间主任以上的领导干部和老技术工人，采取脱产短期速成轮训的办法，组织他们学习初中文化课程，收到了很大的成绩。
    这个厂现有的一百一十二名车间主任以上的领导干部，73％是老工人出身。他们共同特点是，具有丰富的实际生产经验，工作积极肯干，能够深入实际和职工打成一片；他们的年龄较大，文化程度低（77％的人只有业余高小或初中一年的水平）。这就大大的限制了他们的政治理论、企业管理水平和生产技术知识的提高。而这些同志却是工厂生产的领导骨干，生产任务完成的好坏，和他们有直接关系。他们迫切要求学习，但是由于工作忙、会议和社会活动多，使他们的学习很难坚持。对这些干部的文化学习，过去党委虽然想了很多办法，但是每学期学习结业时，干部的结业率最高也达不到20％，而一般职工的结业率却在73％以上。
    为了提高干部的领导水平，党委采取了有效的措施，决定在不影响生产的前提下，合理地利用工厂的现有设备和业余学校的师资力量，以半脱产、脱产短期速成轮训的办法，分期、分批地组织全厂三百九十七名不足初中文化程度的车间主任以上的领导干部和老技术工人，学习文化。1957年8月2日，正式开办了第一期脱产速成文化学习班，抽调了党支部书记、科长、车间主任等二十七名干部参加学习。到1958年2月10日结束。这期间，除例假和停课两周进行整风与反右派斗争外，实际授课日数只有五个多月的时间，共学完了初中的语文、几何、代数、物理、化学等课程的基本内容。参加学习的二十七名干部，除有三个人因为特殊情况中途停学外，剩下的二十四人全部坚持到毕业。现在他们已经升入了业余高中和业余中等专业班学习。
    工厂党委认真地总结了经验，于今年5月初，又开办了第二期，组织了二十四个人参加学习。
    每次抽干部学习之前，党委都认真地调整了干部力量，使参加学习的干部所担任的工作，有人接替，同时还反复地向广大职工讲清这种作法的意义，职工们都很拥护这种作法，大家表示不但不能因为干部参加学习而影响生产，还要超额完成生产任务。
    在组织方面，教学和行政工作，确定由工厂业余学校办公室负责。班里成立党支部，加强思想工作，保证教学。还成立了班委会，领导学习。在教学上采用了普通中学的课本，适当删削不必要的内容，以符合时间的要求。根据课程本身的系统性，确定前一段的学习时间，着重代数、语文和化学；学完代数后、再集中讲几何和物理。讲课时，为了适合干部的特点，联系实际，阐明理论。学校要求教师在备课时，深入了解学员的思想要求，教师在讲课时都能作到直观、通俗。教师每天到课堂去分别辅导，课外辅导每周至少一次。教师和学员定期召开座谈会，交换意见，不断改进教学方法。课程的编排，每天除讲六节课以外，在课堂中进行两小时的复习，每周还有半天的复习时间，做到了及时消化，当堂巩固。为了巩固干部所学得的知识，党委在他们初中毕业后，又马上组织他们升入不同的班级，继续坚持学习。
