Mountain Climbing Diary

    Bonfire Party

    July 1st.

    Tonight, the sky is full of stars. The mountaineering team held a joyous bonfire party at the base camp at the foot of Muztagh Ata.

    Xu Jing, the secretary of the Chinese Mountaineering Team branch of the Communist Party, reported to everyone that the evening's party was both to celebrate the 38th anniversary of the founding of the Party and to wish for victory in the ascent of the main peak starting tomorrow. He called on every mountaineer to learn from the Party's confidence in the victory of all undertakings and its spirit of hard work, dauntless courage in practical work.

    The team members sat around the blazing bonfire. Five Tibetan team members who were good at singing and dancing volunteered to dance a Tibetan farmers' dance. The entire camp became lively. There was Peking Opera, Huangmei Opera, Henan Zhui Opera, Shandong Kuaishu and crosstalk; there were Han, Tibetan, Uyghur and Mongolian songs, and dances from various ethnic groups. Almost every team member performed a program. The bright red firelight shone on the healthy, tanned, and happy faces of the mountaineers, and the melting stream of the Yangbulak Glacier tinkled, as if providing musical accompaniment for the evening party. At the party, sports champions Shi Zhanchun and Xu Jing performed the children's song "Three Tigers," and their innocent movements caused a burst of laughter. Yue Baowa, a mountaineer and soldier of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the frontier, performed a Uyghur iron ring dance. Without an iron ring, he used a wooden stick instead, and danced vividly. Yuan Yang, a trainee from the Beijing Institute of Geology and deputy team leader, sang "Song of the Prospecting Team," and female doctor Wang Yiqin sang an interlude from the movie "Red Glow." Tibetan female team members also sang the Tibetan song "I Love My Hometown." The entertainment program continued until late at night, and all the team members stood up and sang "Song of the Mountaineers" before reluctantly returning to their tents.

          The Moment of Battle

      July 2nd.

    The moment of battle has arrived. The Chinese mixed male and female Muztagh Ata mountaineering team officially set off today to climb the main peak. Towering in front of the team members is a pyramid-shaped mountain covered with ice and snow, rising 7,546 meters above sea level. The mountain is so high and the road is so long that even in extremely good weather conditions, it takes six days to endure the difficulties of low pressure and lack of oxygen to climb to the summit.

    After breakfast, Muztagh Ata shone with brilliant light under the sunlight. Team members packed their food and equipment into their backpacks. The equipment for this assault on the main peak was very light, with an average load of only 8.6 kilograms per person. In addition to the necessary high-altitude tents, down sleeping bags, down jackets, and high-altitude warm boots, they only carried Chinese-style dried rice (cooked and dried rice), pickled vegetables, pickled tofu, and some canned fruit and other foods.

    The equipment was arranged. At about 10:00 a.m., more than forty male and female mountaineers who were assaulting the main peak held a swearing-in ceremony in front of the base camp. Shi Zhanchun, director of the Mountaineering Department of the State Sports Commission, spoke to the team members. He asked these brave male and female team members to cherish every minute and every second before the battle to check all the preparations before climbing Muztagh Ata, especially the mental preparation. Because, in the process of climbing, every step forward requires a huge expenditure of physical and mental energy. He said: "We have gone through arduous training and various tests in the past, and we have now become a mountaineering team with strong combat effectiveness. We must continue our efforts to open a new chapter in the history of women's mountaineering in our country and establish merits for the country's sports! Victory belongs to the Party! Honor belongs to the strong and brave people!" The mountaineers listened quietly to his every word.

    Then, Shi Zhanchun, on behalf of the State Sports Commission and the Party Group of the Mountaineering Team, presented a national flag to the Chinese mixed male and female Muztagh Ata mountaineering team. He hoped that the mountaineers would advance bravely under the guidance of this victorious red flag and plant it on the highest point of the "Father of Ice Mountains."

    Yuan Yang (female), deputy leader of the mountaineering team, led all the mountaineers in an oath in front of the five-star national flag. The oath said: We, the forty-seven male and female mountaineers, accept the glorious and arduous task entrusted to us by the Party, and let the five-star red flag of the motherland fly on the summit of Muztagh Ata. We answer loudly to the Party: We will definitely complete the task victoriously.

    The Party teaches us: There are countless dangers on the road ahead, and there are countless difficulties in the cause of victory. Storms, ice, snow and lightning will make us stronger and braver.

    We solemnly swear to the Party: The Party's support and encouragement are our strength, and we can overcome any difficulty, no matter how great. No difficulty can stop us from moving forward courageously!

    At 10:30 a.m., all the team members marched towards the main peak of Muztagh Ata under the banner of the national flag. (To be continued)

    登山日记
    篝火晚会
    7月1日。
    今天晚上，满天繁星。登山队在慕士塔格山下的大本营，举行了一次欢乐的篝火晚会。
    中共登山队支部书记许竞向大家报告说，今夜晚会一方面是庆祝党的三十八周年生日，另一方面是预祝从明天开始的攀登主峰的胜利。他号召每一个登山队员学习党对各项事业充满着胜利的信心和在实际工作中艰苦奋斗、勇往直前的精神。
    队员们围着熊熊的篝火席地而坐。五名能歌善舞的藏族队员首先自告奋勇，跳了西藏农民舞。整个营地便活跃起来了。这里有京剧，有黄梅戏，有河南坠子，也有山东快书和相声；有汉族，藏族、维吾尔族和蒙古族的歌曲，也有各民族的舞蹈。几乎每一个队员都表演了节目。红艳艳的火光照在登山队员健康、黝黑和快乐的脸上，洋布拉克冰川融化的溪水潺潺地作响，仿佛在为这次晚会作着音乐伴奏。晚会上，运动健将史占春和许竞表演了儿童歌曲“三只老虎”，他们那种天真的动作，引起了哄堂大笑。登山队员、驻守边疆的人民解放军战士岳保娃，表演了维吾尔族的铁环舞。没有铁环，他用一条木棒代替，也跳得维妙维肖。北京地质学院进修生、副队长袁扬演唱了“勘探队员之歌”，女医生王义勤演唱了电影“红霞”中的插曲。藏族女队员还合唱了藏歌“我爱我的家乡”。游艺节目一直进行到深夜，全体队员起立合唱了“登山队员之歌”，大家才恋恋不舍地回到各自的帐篷中去。
          战斗的时刻
      7月2日。
    战斗的时刻到了。中国男、女混合慕士塔格登山队今天正式出发攀登主峰。在队员们面前耸立着的，是一座拔海七千五百四十六米的金字塔般的覆盖着冰、雪的山峰。山是这样高，路是这样远，即使在极良好的气候条件下，也需要六天时间，忍受着低压、缺氧等困难，才能攀登到雪山顶峰。
    吃罢早饭，慕士塔格雪山在阳光照射下发出灿烂耀眼的光芒。队员们纷纷把自己的食品和装备打入背包。登山队这次突击主峰的装备很轻，平均每人负荷只有十七点二市斤，除了必要的高山帐篷、鸭绒睡被、鸭绒衣、高山暖靴以外，只携带了中国风味的干燥米饭（煮熟晒干的米饭）、榨菜、腌豆腐，以及一些水果罐头等食品。
    行装安排好了。十时左右，四十多名突击主峰的男、女登山运动员在大本营前举行了宣誓典礼。国家体委登山处处长史占春向队员讲话。他要求这些勇敢的男、女队员们，必须珍惜战斗前每一分钟每一秒钟的时间，来检查自己攀登慕士塔格山峰前的一切准备，特别是意志方面的准备。因为，在登山的过程中，每一个队员前进一步，都要付出体力上的、精神上的巨大的消耗。他说：“我们以前经过了艰苦的锻炼，经受过各种考验，我们目前已变成了一支战斗力很强的登山队伍。我们一定能够再接再厉，为揭开我国女子登山历史新的一页，为祖国的体育运动建立功勋！胜利归功于党！荣誉属于坚强勇敢的人们！”登山队员们都静静地听着他的每一句话，每一个字。
    接着，史占春代表国家体委和登山队中共党组，把一面国旗授给了中国男、女混合慕士塔格登山队，他希望登山队员在这面胜利的红旗的引导下，勇敢地前进，把它插在“冰山之父”的最高点。
    登山队副队长袁扬（女）带领全体登山队员在五星国旗前宣誓。誓词说：我们四十七名男、女登山队员，接受党交给我们的光荣而艰巨的任务，让祖国的五星红旗飘扬在慕士塔格顶峰。我们向党响亮地回答：一定胜利完成任务。
    党教导我们说：前进的路上有无数的艰险，胜利的事业里有无数困难。风暴、冰雪和雷电要使我们变得更坚强更勇敢。
    我们坚决地向党宣誓：党的支持和鼓舞，就是我们的力量，天大的困难我们也能突破。任何艰险也阻挡不住我们勇往直前！
    十时半，全体队员便在国旗招引下，向慕士塔格主峰前进了。　（四续）
