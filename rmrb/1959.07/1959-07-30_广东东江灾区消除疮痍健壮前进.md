Eradicating Scars of Disaster and Advancing Robustly in the Dongjiang Disaster Area of Guangdong
Grain Rations Arranged to Households, Effectively Guaranteeing Supply; Large Numbers of Houses Built, All Disaster Victims Sheltered
Collapsed Dikes Basically Repaired; Early Rice Harvest Basically Completed; Concentrating Efforts to Rush Planting of Late Rice
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 29th: Production and life in the Dongjiang River flood-stricken areas of Guangdong have returned to normal. This area, which suffered severe damage from the floods, has done a quick and good job in production and disaster relief. Only a little over a month after the disaster, the lives of the people in the disaster area have been initially properly settled; the collapsed dikes have been basically repaired; all the late rice seeds have been sown; and the early rice harvest has also been basically completed. At present, the masses in the disaster area are fully engaged in late rice production, concentrating their efforts to rush planting of late rice.

The four counties of Huiyang, Boluo, Dongguan, and Zengcheng in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River were the most severely affected by this flood. Under the impact of an extraordinary flood unseen in a century, most of the dikes collapsed, more than 1.3 million mu of early rice out of 2.4 million mu were flooded, of which more than 700,000 mu were completely lost. Economic crops, livestock, and pond fish also suffered serious losses. More than 200,000 residents had their houses washed away by the flood. In order to overcome the disaster and restore production, the Party committees at all levels led the masses in the disaster area and carried out a tenacious struggle against these difficulties. With the strong support of all parties, all the victims in the disaster area have never gone without a meal from the time the flood occurred until now. Recently, the various communes and brigades in the disaster area have arranged the grain rations needed by the masses before autumn directly to households, so that the necessary grain supply for the masses has been effectively guaranteed. In solving the housing problem, all communes and brigades organized the masses to rush to repair and build temporary shelters as soon as the flood receded. In the past month, these four counties have repaired and built more than 30,000 temporary shelters. Together with the houses vacated by the public, all the victims in the area have been sheltered. In order to protect the health of the people in the disaster area, the province, the special zone, and the local troops also sent a large number of medical personnel and local medical personnel to treat the sick victims in time, and widely carried out health work in the disaster area.

After properly settling the lives of the masses, the Party committees at all levels immediately led the masses to vigorously restore production. Now, the four counties have sown more than 40 million catties of late rice seeds, and the planting area of late rice will reach 3 million mu. The breaches of the main dikes in various places have also been basically restored to their original standards or to standards that can defend against general autumn floods. Most of the irrigation projects such as ponds, reservoirs, weirs, and ditches that were washed away by mountain floods have been repaired. After the flood receded, various places also seized the time to plow the more than 700,000 mu of lost rice fields. At the same time, they also seized the opportunity to rush to plant early-maturing crops and develop sideline production. Huiyang County has planted more than 100,000 mu of early-maturing crops, and the income from sideline production has reached more than 500,000 yuan.

Recently, the CPC Foshan Prefectural Committee held a working conference in Huiyang City on the disaster areas of Dongjiang River, requiring cadres at all levels to further lead the masses to launch a large-scale production and self-help movement, highly concentrate labor, and strive to plant all the fields that can be planted with late rice seedlings without missing the farming season. At the same time, they should grasp the work of pest control and drought prevention. After completing the summer planting, they should also vigorously grasp diversified operations and strive to eliminate famine after autumn. The meeting also studied the reconstruction of homes and the fundamental solution of the Dongjiang River, and decided that the disaster area should immediately establish a special agency for rebuilding homes with the production brigade as a unit, fix special personnel to lead, and actively carry out the design of houses and the preparation of materials, so as to strive for time to rebuild the collapsed houses as soon as possible. At the same time, it was decided to vigorously carry out water conservancy construction this winter and next spring.

    生产救灾又快又好，力争秋后消灭灾荒
    广东东江灾区消除疮痍健壮前进
    口粮安排到户、切实保证供应，修造大批住房、灾民都有住所
    崩缺堤围基本堵复，早稻收割基本完成，集中力量赶插晚稻
    新华社广州29日电　广东东江水灾地区的生产和生活秩序，已经恢复。这个受到水灾严重破坏的地区，生产救灾工作做得又快又好。离受灾仅仅一个多月，灾区群众的生活，初步地得到妥善安置；崩缺的堤围已经基本上堵复；晚造的种籽，全部播下；早稻收割工作，也基本上完成。目前，灾区群众正全力投入晚造生产，集中力量赶插晚稻。
    东江下游惠阳、博罗、东莞、增城四县，是这次水灾最严重的地区。在百年未有的特大洪水冲击下，堤围大部分崩缺，二百四十多万亩早稻，有一百三十多万亩受淹，其中七十多万亩完全失收。经济作物、牲畜、塘鱼，也受到严重损失。还有二十多万居民的房子被洪水冲塌。为了战胜灾害，恢复生产，各级党委领导灾区群众和这些困难进行了顽强的斗争。在各方面的大力支持下，灾区所有灾民，从发生洪水到现在从不曾有一个人断过一餐粮。最近，灾区各个公社和大队又把秋前群众需要供应的口粮一直安排到户。使群众必需的口粮供应，得到了切实的保证。在解决住房的问题上，各个公社和大队都在洪水一退，组织群众突击抢修和盖搭临时住所，一个月来，这四个县已修造临时住所三万多间。加上公家腾出的房子，使全区灾民都有了住所。为了保障灾区人民的健康，省、专区和当地驻军还派出了大批医务人员和地方医务人员一起，及时为有病的灾民治疗，并在灾区普遍开展卫生工作。
    在妥善安置了群众的生活以后，各级党委又立即领导群众，大力恢复生产。现在，四个县已播下晚稻种籽四千多万斤，晚稻的种植面积将达到三百万亩。各地主要堤围的缺口，也都基本上按照原来的标准或能防御秋季一般洪水的标准恢复起来。被山洪冲崩了的塘、库、陂、圳等灌溉工程绝大部分已经修复。各地在洪水退后，还抓紧时间把失收的七十多万亩稻田耕翻了一遍。与此同时，还抓紧时机抢种早熟作物和开展副业生产。惠阳县已种了十多万亩早熟作物，副业生产的收入达五十多万元。
    最近，中共佛山地委在惠阳城召开了东江灾区工作会议，要求各级干部进一步领导群众开展一个大规模的生产自救运动，高度集中劳动力，争取不误农时地把能插晚稻秧苗的田都插下去。同时抓紧除虫、防旱工作。完成夏种后，还要大抓多种经营，力争秋后消灭灾荒。会议还研究了重建家园和根治东江的工作，决定灾区立即以生产大队为单位成立重建家园的专门机构，固定专人领导，积极进行房屋的设计和备料工作，以便争取时间尽快地把倒塌的房屋重建起来。同时决定在今冬明春大力兴修水利。
