    香港灾胞受到祖国关怀
    一万多人领到了救济大米
    新华社香港17日电　香港、九龙遭受暴雨灾害的同胞，已有一万一千多人领到了祖国人民救济的大米。香港英国新闻处曾经公布，港九市区和郊区的受灾人数总共达一万五千零四人。
    这批大米共有十六万斤，是由中国人民救济总会广东分会拨赠的，在7月10日运抵香港，由香港中华总商会协助在港九各个灾区发放。从7月14日到16日的三天中，已在香港筲箕湾、香港仔、九龙红磡和深水埗等四个地区向一万一千多个受灾同胞发出大米十万斤左右。
    香港受灾同胞非常感激祖国对他们的关怀。祖国的救济，使他们感到无限温暖。当一袋袋的救济米送到受灾同胞手中时，他们的脸上露出了笑容。深水埗区的灾胞李维说：“人民政府真是关心人民。”在永康街街边暂时搭棚居住的灾胞何耀说，广东有些地区今年也受了水灾，但是祖国人民还没有忘记救济在香港受灾的同胞。
