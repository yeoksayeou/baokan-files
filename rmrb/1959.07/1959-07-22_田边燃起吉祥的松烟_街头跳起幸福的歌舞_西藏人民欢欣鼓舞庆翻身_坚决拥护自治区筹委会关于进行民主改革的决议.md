Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 21st: The news that the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region passed the resolution to carry out democratic reform throughout the region spread rapidly like spring thunder to all parts of Tibet. The broad masses of the people were ecstatic and expressed their firm support for the Preparatory Committee's resolution.

In the urban and suburban areas of Lhasa, a scene of jubilation prevailed after the news of the Preparatory Committee's passage of the reform resolution spread. Residents of Lhasa City told each other the good news amidst cheers, and many propaganda teams organized by young people and women carried out publicity on the streets. Many residents spontaneously gathered to discuss the resolution on democratic reform. Some were so happy that they sang and danced in the streets. On Barkhor Street in the city center, Tibetan residents wrote excerpts of the resolution on democratic reform in large characters on self-made blackboards and wall newspapers. Many people rushed to tell each other their joy. Cairin Zhuoma, who had been a domestic slave for more than fifty years for the rebel leader Suokang Wangqing Geler, told people: I suffered in Suokang's house for fifty years, working like an animal. I lived next to the toilet all year round. Suokang never gave me salt or tea, only half a bowl of coarse zanba paste every day. Now, the poisonous snake wrapped around us has been cut off, and we slaves who have suffered will never be oppressed again. Poor Chaba, Dueqiong, and Langsheng in Caizongbaicai Village and Gongtang Village near Lhasa, after hearing the good news of the abolition of Ula corvee, usurious exploitation, and personal enslavement, immediately lit auspicious pine smoke in the fields. Some played the pipa and sanxian, and some danced the lion and yak dance, holding enthusiastic celebrations. At the celebration meeting in Caigongtang, Yang Cong and his wife, who had suffered persecution by the serf owners for failing to pay head tax, wore new clothes that day, holding the five-star red flag and beating cowhide drums, enthusiastically singing and dancing on the grass. They sang: "Auspicious pine smoke is burning, happy days have arrived, exploitation and oppression are gone, and we will no longer suffer from head tax."

In Zedang, Shannan Prefecture, representatives attending the first peasant representative conference of Naidong County, upon hearing the news of the passage of the democratic reform resolution, immediately gathered together and invited Deputy County Chief Zhaxi Jianzan to give a detailed briefing. The representatives were all overjoyed. They said "Zhaxi Dele" (good luck) to each other and enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Long live the Communist Party!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" That night, the representatives sat around in tents until late at night, saying that the Communist Party had pointed out a bright road for us, and the Preparatory Committee's resolution told us how to follow this road. Every sentence of the resolution spoke to our hearts. The representatives all said that they would immediately take the resolution back to their hometowns, publicize it to the villagers, and lead everyone to resolutely implement it.

On the day the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region closed, the broadcast loudspeakers in Gyantse City were crowded with people listening to the good news. Farmers who came to Gyantse City from the surrounding countryside with donkeys loaded with firewood also stopped to listen to the broadcast. The farmers said that hearing this good news was like "a peacock hearing spring thunder." Some people said, "In the past, even the sun did not belong to us, but now the sun shines into the homes of us poor people." Peng Duo, a female domestic slave in her sixties, said: "After hearing today's news, I feel like I am dreaming. Is there really such a good thing in the world?" Peng Duo told people: "I have suffered more than fifty years of oppression from serf owners. In the past, I often thought about committing suicide, but now I want to live a free and happy life." Poor peasant Peng Cuo Dunzhu told people: "My family has been serfs for generations, and we have toiled for generations without earning a piece of land the size of a palm. Now we are like a dry garden being watered. From now on, we will work for ourselves. I must work harder and create a happy life." Chaba Lami from Cangga Creek near Gyantse said that his grandfather borrowed a sum of money from the rebel leader Pala, which his father never finished paying off in his lifetime. Later, the debt accumulated to 360 grams of grain and 10 scales of Tibetan silver. Lami borrowed from the east and scraped from the west, and continued to pay for decades, but now the debt has instead become more than 1,000 grams of grain and 50 scales of Tibetan silver, and the number of creditors has increased to more than 40 households. Lami said: "Usury is like a cowhide hat (a kind of torture tool in Tibet that persecutes serfs, using wet cowhide to put on the head, and the skin shrinks when it dries), the tighter it is worn. Now that the abolition of old debts has been announced, this has permanently released the chains on my descendants."

On the second day after the Preparatory Committee closed, people from all walks of life in Linzhi, Tagong Prefecture, held a celebration meeting. Representatives from all walks of life unanimously demanded at the meeting that a democratic reform movement be launched immediately throughout the region. Kalai Basang, Director of the Pacification and Production Committee of Niche Village, said excitedly at the meeting: "Nobles are born nobles, and serfs are born serfs. This is the most unfair thing in the world. Now that the government has announced the law, we must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, rely on the strength of our own working people to resolutely abolish this system and strive for complete liberation." After the celebration meeting ended, people were excited and immediately formed a dance circle in the field, cheering and singing to their heart's content.

On the vast northern Tibetan grasslands, herders warmly celebrated the abolition of Ula corvee, usurious exploitation, and personal enslavement. They said that these three barbaric systems were three knives stuck in the bodies of the herders. If these three knives are not pulled out, they will always be slaughtered. Now, the thousand-year-old mountain has been pushed down, and the thousand-year-old shackles have finally been broken. Zeng Jia, a herdsman who fled from his hometown to Heihe City to escape Ula and exorbitant taxes, said: "Today, the herders have finally made it through! Thirty years ago, my family had 200 head of cattle and 100 sheep. Later, under the cruel oppression of the former Tibetan local government, we were forced to sell them all in less than ten years. My uncle was gouged out his eyes and died alive by the personnel of the reactionary former Tibetan local government because he could not afford to pay the corvee tax." Zeng Jia expressed his firm support for the Preparatory Committee's resolution and vowed never to allow the cruel and barbaric serf system to continue to persecute the working people.

    田边燃起吉祥的松烟　街头跳起幸福的歌舞
    西藏人民欢欣鼓舞庆翻身
    坚决拥护自治区筹委会关于进行民主改革的决议
    新华社拉萨21日电　西藏自治区筹委会第二次全体委员会议通过在全区进行民主改革决议的消息，像春雷一样迅速传遍西藏各地，广大人民欢欣若狂，表示坚决拥护筹委会的决议。
    在拉萨城区和郊区，当筹委会通过改革决议的消息传出以后，到处是欢腾的景象。拉萨市居民在欢呼中互相传送喜讯，青年们和妇女们组织的许多宣传队在街头宣传。很多居民自动集会座谈民主改革的决议，有的人高兴得在街头上歌舞起来。在市中心的八角街上，藏族居民在自己办的黑板报和墙报上，用大字写出了关于进行民主改革决议的摘要。许多人奔走相告自己心里的喜悦。曾经给叛乱头子索康·旺清格勒当过五十多年家奴的才仁卓玛对人说：我在索康家受了五十年的罪，干活像牛马，成年住在厕所旁边，索康从来没有给我发过盐巴和茶叶，每天只给半碗粗糌粑糊糊。现在，缠在我们身上的毒蛇被斩断了，我们这些受苦受难的奴隶永远不再受压迫了。拉萨附近蔡宗百蔡村和公堂村贫穷的差巴、堆穷和朗生们，听到废除乌拉差役、高利贷剥削和人身奴役的喜讯后，他们立即在田边燃起了象征吉祥的松烟，有的弹起琵琶和三弦琴，有的跳起狮子和牦牛舞，热烈地集会庆祝。在蔡公堂的庆祝集会上，因为交不上人头税而饱受农奴主迫害的央琮夫妇，这天两人都穿着新衣服，举着五星红旗，敲着牛皮鼓，在草地上热情地歌舞起来，他们唱道：“吉祥的松烟在燃烧，幸福的日子来到了，剥削压榨没有了，再不受人头税熬煎了。”
    在山南地区的泽当，参加乃东县第一次农民代表会议的代表听到通过民主改革决议的消息时，立即集合起来，邀请副县长扎喜坚赞作详细传达。代表们个个兴高采烈，他们互道“扎喜德勒”（吉祥如意），热烈地高呼“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”等口号。当天晚上，代表们围坐在帐篷里一直谈到深夜，他们说，共产党给我们指出了光明大道，筹委会的决议又告诉了我们这条路应该怎样走，决议的每一句话都说到了我们心里。代表们都表示要马上把决议带到家乡去，向乡亲们宣传，并带领大家坚决执行。
    西藏自治区筹委会第二次全体委员会议闭幕的这一天，江孜市各个广播喇叭筒前，站满了收听喜讯的人群，从四乡赶着毛驴来江孜市卖柴的农民，也停下来听广播。农民们说，听到这个喜讯，就像是
  “孔雀听到春雷”一样的高兴。有的人说，“过去连太阳也不属于我们，现在太阳照到我们穷人家里来了。”六十多岁的女家奴彭多说：
  “听了今天的消息，我好像是在做梦一样，难道人间真有这样好的事情吗？”彭多对人说：“我受了农奴主五十多年的欺压，过去常常想着寻死，可是现在我要过一过自由幸福的生活。”贫苦农民彭错顿珠对人说：“我家世世代代当农奴，劳累了几辈子没有挣下巴掌大的一块地，现在我们就像干旱的花园浇了水一样，今后劳动是为了自己，我一定要加劲生产，创造幸福的生活。”江孜附近藏噶溪卡的差巴拉米说，他祖父借了叛乱头子帕拉一笔债，父亲还了一生也没有还清，后来这笔债累积到三百六十克粮食和十秤藏银，拉米东借西挪，又接着还了几十年，现在债务反而变成了一千多克粮和五十秤藏银，债主增加到四十多户。拉米说：“高利贷像牛皮帽子（西藏的一种迫害农奴的刑具，用湿牛皮套在头上，皮一干就缩紧了），越戴越紧，现在宣布废除了旧债，这给我的子孙后代永远解除了身上的锁链。”
    筹委会闭幕的第二天，塔工地区的林芝，各阶层人民举行了庆祝大会，各阶层代表在会上一致要求在全区立即开展民主改革运动。尼池村平叛生产委员会主任委员卡来巴桑在会上激动地说：“贵族生下来就是贵族，农奴生下来就是农奴，这是世间最不公平的事；现在政府宣布了法令，我们要在共产党的领导下，依靠我们劳动人民自己的力量，坚决废除这种制度，争取彻底翻身。”庆祝大会结束以后，人们情绪激奋，立即在场地上围成一个舞圈，尽情地欢呼歌舞。
    在辽阔的藏北草原上，牧民们热烈庆祝废除乌拉差役、高利贷剥削和人身奴役，他们说，这三种野蛮的制度是插在牧民身上的三把刀，不拔掉这三把刀，就永远要受宰割，现在，千年的大山推倒了，千年的镣铐终于打断了。为躲避乌拉和苛捐杂税从家乡逃到黑河市的牧民增甲说：“今天牧民总算熬出来了！三十年前我家有二百头牛，一百只羊，后来在原西藏地方政府的残酷压榨下，不到十几年时间，便被迫全部卖光了。我叔父因为无力支付差税，结果被反动的原西藏地方政府的人员挖掉双眼，活活地痛死。”增甲表示坚决拥护筹委会决议，决不容许残酷、野蛮的农奴制度再继续迫害劳动人民。（附图片）
    7月17日下午，拉萨市人民举行群众大会，一致拥护西藏自治区筹委会第二次全体会议所通过的关于进行民主改革的决议。在群众大会上高呼：“坚决、彻底摧毁残酷、黑暗、反动的农奴制度，彻底完成民主改革！”
