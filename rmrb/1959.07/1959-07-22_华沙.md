    Warsaw
    Cheng Guangrui
    Warsaw, since who knows when, has been circulating a beautiful story: In the green waves of the Vistula River, lives a brave mermaid. In one hand she holds a sword, and in the other a shield, protecting love and justice in the human world. During the cruel years of war, she fought covered in blood. The enemy wanted to take her life, to turn Warsaw into a city of death. But she did not yield in the slightest, and Warsaw still stood firm in the ruins. The suffering flowed away with the river, and the sun shone again across the Polish land. The mermaid woke up from her sleep and suddenly discovered a miracle on the shore:
  "Who moved my crystal palace from the bottom of the water to the land?" This is not a palace of gods, but a miracle created by the hands of the people. Bandits wanted to wipe out Warsaw, but the people built it even more magnificent! Now the mermaid still stands on the riverbank, protecting the people's city with love.

    华沙
    程光锐华沙，不知从什么时候起，就流传着一个美丽的故事：在维斯杜拉河的绿波里，住着一个勇敢的美人鱼。她一手拿着剑，一手拿着
  盾，保卫着人间的爱情和正义。在残酷的战争岁月里，她战斗得浑身血迹。敌人要夺去她的生命，要把华沙变成死亡的城市。可是，她丝毫也没有屈服，华沙在废墟中依然屹立。苦难随着河水流去，阳光又照遍了波兰大地。美人鱼从睡梦中醒来，忽然发现岸上的奇迹：
  “是谁把我的水晶宫，从水底搬上了陆地？”这不是神仙的宫殿，是人民双手创造的奇迹。匪徒们要把华沙抹掉，人民却把它建设的更壮丽！如今美人鱼仍站在河岸上，用爱情佑护着人民的城市。
