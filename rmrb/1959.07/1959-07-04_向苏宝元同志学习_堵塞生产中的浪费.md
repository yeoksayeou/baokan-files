    Learn from Comrade Su Baoyuan
    Block Waste in Production
    After reading the story of Su Baoyuan, a diligent odd-job worker, about increasing production and practicing economy, published on the second page of the People's Daily on June 13th, the image of "Old Su" working diligently often appears in my mind. Su Baoyuan collected the "waste products" discarded by people and solved the problems of the power station's turbine and the molding sand screening. He demonstrated the working class's sense of responsibility as masters in his ordinary work, which is moving and worthy of learning from.
    However, thinking of these waste products, we cannot help but think that factories like the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant are by no means isolated cases in our country. If there were no people like Su Baoyuan to pick up materials at any time, it is conceivable that "waste products" would be buried along with garbage and dirt, and the "man-made mines" created would be more than just four or five warehouses. Everyone knows the principle of "not being meticulous, not being rich; accumulating little makes a lot," but this principle is also easily overlooked. We hope that such factories will quickly establish scientific management systems to reduce or prevent the generation of "man-made mines."

    向苏宝元同志学习
    堵塞生产中的浪费
    读了6月13日人民日报第二版刊登的勤杂工苏宝元增产节约的故事以后，在我的脑子里经常出现了“老苏头”勤勤恳恳的形象。苏宝元把人们抛弃的“废品”收集起来解决了电站汽轮机、造型筛砂的问题，他在平常的工作岗位上发挥了工人阶级主人翁的责任感，这是令人感动和值得学习的。
    但是，想起这些废品，也不得不使我们想到：在我们国家里，像沈阳第三机床厂这样的工厂绝不是个别的。如果没有苏宝元这样的人随时捡拾物资，可以想像“废品”将随同垃圾、脏土一道被埋藏起来，造成的“人造矿”就不止于四五个仓库了。“不细不富、集腋成裘”的道理，谁都知道，但是，这个道理也容易被人忽略。我们希望这样的工厂迅速建立科学的管理制度，减少或防止“人造矿”的产生。
