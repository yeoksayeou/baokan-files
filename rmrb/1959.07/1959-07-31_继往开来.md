Carrying Forward the Past and Opening Up the Future
Zheng Yingnian

There's an old saying, "Carry forward the past and open up the future." The change of things is a process of carrying forward the past and opening up the future. The past is the foundation of the future; there is no future without the past. At the same time, the future is the development of the past; carrying forward the past is for the sake of opening up the future.

As Lenin pointed out, the movement of things always starts from something; there is no movement that "starts from nothing" (see "Philosophical Notebooks," page 112). The new will inevitably replace the old, but the new is produced on the basis of the old. Lao Tzu said: "All things under heaven are born of existence, and existence is born of non-existence," which is idealism. If people do not inherit the past, "then to know that the earth is round, everyone would have to circumnavigate the earth themselves; to manufacture a steam engine, they would have to sit in front of a boiling kettle and investigate all things..." (Qu Qiubai: "Thoroughly"). Isn't this ridiculous?

But the changes in the world are not like a revolving lantern, simply repeating in cycles; it not only inherits the past but also develops forward on the basis of the past. Humans evolved from monkeys, but humans are more advanced than monkeys. Socialism evolved from capitalism, but socialism is infinitely superior to capitalism. If one only knows how to maintain the existing business and does not know how to start a new one, then people today would still be wearing animal skins and leaves, drinking blood. It is certainly unacceptable not to understand carrying forward the past, but if one only knows how to carry forward the past and does not know how to open up the future, the world will become a stagnant pool.

We need to have the spirit of carrying forward the past and opening up the future not only in studying scientific and cultural issues but also in doing other work.

The so-called carrying forward the past and opening up the future in work means that we should determine the direction and plan of our work on the basis of the original work and then push the work forward.

For production to develop, it is necessary to take the level of productivity already achieved in the past as the foundation and pay attention to the material conditions that have already been obtained, such as human, material, and financial resources. People are free because they gain the initiative by recognizing necessity. However, people are also not free; the conditions people encounter are always created by the past. In any case, they can only take what the past has created as the starting point for their actions. If one acts solely on subjective wishes, regardless of the permission of existing conditions, even if one spends a great deal of effort, the wish will not be realized.

Although we cannot transcend the established conditions to arrange our work, it is necessary and possible to push the work forward within the scope permitted by the established conditions. When Chairman Mao talked about military issues, he said: "The stage for the activities of military strategists is built on top of objective material conditions, but military strategists can direct many vivid and magnificent dramas by relying on this stage." ("Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War") As long as we observe carefully, the established conditions contain new tasks and methods for solving new tasks. For example, as long as we have engaged in production for a period of time, we will have more accumulation than before. Then, the future production targets can be set higher, and there are also conditions to complete this target.

Human social life has different characteristics from natural phenomena. The changes in the universe and the movement of the sun, moon, and stars do not involve human activities, but social life is created by human beings. The old contains elements of the new, but without people's practice, the new will not change from possibility to reality. In our country, the obstacles that bound the productive forces have been removed, and new relations of production have been established. We are fully equipped to draw the newest and most beautiful picture on the earth. We should roll up our sleeves, pick up our pens, dip them in full color, and paint boldly. Naturally, all work advances in a wave-like manner, with qualitative changes, quantitative changes, development, and consolidation. But no matter what the situation, whether it is qualitative change, quantitative change, development, or consolidation, things must be done through human effort.

Therefore, on the one hand, we must make a calm analysis of the established objective conditions, and on the other hand, we must fully develop the soaring enthusiasm and revolutionary creativity of the masses. We must oppose sticking to conventions and backward conservatism at all times, and advocate striving for the upstream and carrying forward the past and opening up the future. "A tall building rises from the ground," which is correct, but to build a tall building, we must dare to "rise from the ground."

Carrying forward the past and opening up the future in work also means doing a better job in the future.

When we summarize after completing a task, it is to inherit experience and learn from lessons. There is no such thing as a pure thing in the world; "digging for gold also involves digging through dirt." In past things, there are affirmations and negations. Revolutionary undertakings are earth-shattering initiatives and mass movements of hundreds of millions of people, and shortcomings and errors are always unavoidable. However, it must be seen that our direction is correct, and in general, achievements are always the main thing, and shortcomings are always secondary. This is like the Yangtze River, although there are whirlpools and backwaters, it still flows eastward for thousands of miles. Some people simplify things and think that if an apple has a rotten spot, it is unacceptable and throw it away immediately. Lu Xun said it well: "If it is not rotten to the core, then say: this apple has a rotten spot, but these places are not rotten, and you can still eat it." ("Complete Works of Lu Xun," Volume 5, page 237) Moreover, the shortcomings in our work today are often not a matter of rotten spots in many cases, but often just a few bee stings. We must correctly assess the past; otherwise, we will not be able to inherit successful experiences and affect the development of the next step of work.

As the saying goes, "Pick thorns from the meat." Picking thorns is to protect the health of the body and should not affect people's spirit of progress because of "picking thorns." There is negation in affirmation, and affirmation in negation. Regarding shortcomings, we should study the causes of their formation, take them as lessons, and change mistakes into correctness.

Work has no end. Yesterday is the past, today is the future; but for tomorrow, tomorrow is the future, and today is the past again. Especially at present, we are experiencing an unprecedented Great Leap Forward, and all new things are constantly emerging like fountains. Each of us should be determined, set great ambitions, dare to face the future, break all old shackles, and do things that predecessors have not done on the basis of the achievements of our predecessors.

    继往开来
    郑英年
    古人有句话，叫做“继往开来”。事物的变化正是一个继往开来的过程。往是来的基础，有了往才有来，同时，来是往的发展，继往则是为着开来。
    事物的运动正如列宁所指出的，总是从某个东西开始的，决没有“从无开始”的运动（见“哲学笔记”一一二页）。新的东西必然代替旧的东西，但新的东西是在旧东西的基础上产生的。老子说：
  “天下万物生于有，有生于无”，这是唯心主义的。人们如果不继承过去，“于是要知道地球是圆的，就要人人都要自己去环游地球一周；要制造汽机的，也要先坐在开水壶前格一通物。……”（瞿秋白：“透底”）这岂非笑谈。
    但世界的变化不像走马灯，单纯循环反复；它不仅继承了过去，而且在过去的基础上又向前发展了。人是猴子变的，但人比猴子更高级。社会主义是从资本主义变来的，但社会主义较资本主义无比优越。如果只知道守业而不会创业，那么今天的人，还在披兽皮树叶，茹毛饮血。不懂得继往，固然不可，然而只知道继往而不会开来，世界就成了一潭死水。
    我们不仅在研究科学文化问题上需要有继往开来的精神，就是做其他各项工作也需如此。
    所谓工作上的继往开来，就是说，我们做工作应该在原有的工作基础上，来确定工作的方针和计划，进而把工作推向前去。
    生产要得到发展，就需以过去生产力已达到的水平作为基础，注意人力、物力、财力这些业已取得的物质条件。人是自由的，因为认识了必然就获得了主动权。然而，人又是不自由的，人们碰到的条件，总是过去造成的，无论如何，只能以过去创造的东西作为行动的出发点。如果不顾既成条件的许可，单凭主观愿望办事，纵费九牛二虎之力，愿望也不能实现。
    我们虽不能超越既成的条件来安排工作，可是在既成条件许可的范围内，必需而且可能把工作推进一步。毛主席讲军事问题时说过：“军事家活动的舞台建筑在客观物质条件的上面，然而军事家凭着这个舞台，却可以导演出许多有声有色威武雄壮的活剧来。”（“中国革命的战略问题”）我们只要仔细观察，在既成条件中就包含有新的任务以及解决新任务的方法。比如我们只要搞过一个时期的生产，就会比以前有更多的积累，那么，今后的生产指标就有可能订得高些，同时也有条件来完成这个指标。
    人类社会生活与自然现象有不同的特点，宇宙风云的变幻、日月星辰的运转，它没有人类活动的参与；但社会的生活却是人类创造的。旧东西中已含有新东西的因素，然而，没有人们的实践，新东西就不会由可能变为现实。在我们的国家里，束缚生产力的障碍铲除了，新的生产关系建立起来了，完全有条件在大地上画出一幅最新最美的画图。我们就应该卷起袖子，提起笔来，蘸饱颜色，大画而特画。自然，一切工作是波浪式前进的，有质变、有量变，有发展、有巩固，但无论在什么情况下，质变也好，量变也好，发展也好，巩固也好，事情总得要人努力去做。
    所以我们一方面对既成的客观条件要作冷静的分析，另一方面又要充分发扬群众的冲天干劲与革命创造性，任何时候都必须反对墨守成规，落后保守，提倡力争上游，继往开来。“万丈高楼平地起”，这句话是不错的，然而要使高楼建立起来，就必须敢于“平地起”。
    工作上的继往开来还有一个意思，就是说：把今后的工作做得更好。
    我们做完一件工作进行总结，就是为着继承经验，吸取教训。世界上决没有纯粹的事情，“挖黄金也得挖到泥土”，在已往的事物当中，有肯定的，也有否定的。革命事业是翻天复地的创举，是亿万人民的群众运动，缺点和错误总是难免的；但是必须看到，我们的方向是对头的，总的说来，成绩总是主要的，缺点总是次要的。这犹如长江之水，虽有漩涡，有回水，然而它仍是一泻千里，滚滚东流。有些人看事情简单化，看见苹果有烂疤了，就认为这苹果要不得，一下子抛掉。鲁迅说得好：“倘不是穿心烂，就说：这苹果有着烂疤了，然而这几处没有烂，还可以吃得。”（“鲁迅全集”五卷二百三十七页）何况我们今天工作中的缺点，在很多情况下并不是什么烂疤问题，常常只是几个蜂眼。我们对于既往必须要正确的估计，否则，就会使成功的经验不能继承，影响下一步工作的开展。
    俗话说：“肉中挑刺”，挑刺是为了保护肌体的健康，决不能因“挑刺”而影响了人们前进的精神。肯定当中有否定，否定当中也有肯定。对于缺点，应当研究形成的原因，当作教训记取，改错误为正确。
    工作是没有止境的，昨天是往，今天是来；可是对明天来说，明天是来，今天又是往了。特别在目前，我们正经历着空前未有的大跃进，一切新的事物犹如喷泉，不断涌现，我们每一个人都应该下决心、立大志，敢于面向将来，打破一切旧的束缚，在前人成就的基础上，做前人所未做到的事业。
