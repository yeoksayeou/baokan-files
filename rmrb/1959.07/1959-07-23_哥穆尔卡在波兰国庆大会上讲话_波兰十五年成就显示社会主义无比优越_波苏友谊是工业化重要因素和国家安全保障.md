Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: According to a Polish Press Agency report, Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, spoke on the 21st at the rally celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Polish People's Republic.

In his speech, Gomułka first reviewed the history of the establishment of People's Poland. He said that fifteen years is a relatively short period in the history of a people, but the changes that have taken place in the last fifteen years are greater than those that occurred in decades or even centuries in past historical eras. He pointed out that the contrast between the achievements of the working people of People's Poland over fifteen years and the achievements of capitalist Poland over fifteen years is the best proof of the superiority of socialism and an irrefutable indictment of capitalism.

Comparing the fifteen years of People's Poland to the fifteen years of bourgeois Poland, our coal production has more than doubled, steel and cement production has more than tripled, sugar production has more than doubled, and cotton fabric production has increased by more than half.

On a per capita basis, in 1958, compared to 1937, our country's industrial production increased sevenfold in electricity, doubled in coal, almost quadrupled in steel, quintupled in machine tools, almost tripled in sulfuric acid, increased sevenfold in nitrogen fertilizer, more than doubled in cotton cloth, quadrupled in silk fabrics, and increased one and a half times in sugar.

Many brand-new industrial sectors have emerged in People's Poland, marking a qualitative leap in industrial technology, such as: synthetic chemical industry, shipbuilding industry, automobile and tractor industry, aviation industry, large numbers of radio technology industries, large-scale electrical machinery manufacturing, aluminum manufacturing, artificial fiber manufacturing, etc.

The entire socio-economic structure of the country has undergone fundamental changes: before the war, two-thirds of the residents relied on agriculture for their livelihoods; now, the agricultural population accounts for only 42%.

With the total industrial output almost sextupling, the number of workers has more than doubled. This marks a sharp increase in the proportion of the working class in the population, and also marks a significant increase in social labor productivity.

Compared with the pre-war period, agricultural products per hundred hectares of land have increased by 50.5%, while the agricultural population per hundred hectares of land has decreased by one-third.

Gomułka then said that the vigorous development of the Polish economy has greatly shortened the distance between our country and the most economically developed European countries. In 1937, Poland's steel production per capita was only one-fifth of France's steel production at that time and one-tenth of Germany's steel production. Today, Poland's steel production is equal to 60% of France's current production and 41% of West Germany's. The situation is similar for electricity generation. In terms of fuel production, our country's pre-war level was lower than France's and three-quarters lower than Germany's. Now, we have greatly surpassed France and are approaching West Germany's level. In the production of sulfuric acid, cement, cotton yarn, and artificial fibers, we have shortened the distance with these two countries by one-half or two-thirds.

Gomułka said that we belong to the socialist camp, we are members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, and since the birth of People's Poland, comprehensive economic relations have linked us with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. All of these were and are factors without which our country's industrialization would be unimaginable. In the past fifteen years, more than 70% of the industrial projects we have put into production, using machinery and equipment, have been obtained from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic through supply procedures. Some people once believed that if Poland remained within the capitalist world, its entire economy could be restored and developed. They were too naive. It is very unrealistic to expect assistance from capitalist powers in the modernization and development of the Polish economy, just as it was to expect them to help against Hitler's aggression in 1939.

Gomułka said that looking back on fifteen years, we can say with confidence that the efforts and selflessness shown by our people in these years have been rewarded. This effort and selflessness have brought fruitful results. A leap forward has been completed, and this leap forward has changed the face of our country and fundamentally expanded its productive forces.

Now, relying on past experience and new, richer economic potential, we can put forward new tasks. The tasks for the next seven years will far exceed the achievements of the last ten years in terms of scale.

Gomułka also said that during the fifteen years since the establishment of People's Poland, not only have the economic and social landscape of our country changed, but Poland's role in Europe has also undergone fundamental changes. The new Poland—the Poland of the people, the independent Poland with new and just borders—is today one of the bulwarks of the socialist world, a consistent defender of the idea of peaceful cooperation among countries and peoples, regardless of their social systems. Bonds of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance link us with all our neighbors.

Gomułka said that our borders are secure and inviolable, and the unbreakable friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union is a guarantee of this. The combined strength of the mighty Warsaw Pact is defending the peaceful creative labor of our people.

Gomułka said that we belong to a socialist camp united on the principles of internationalism, mutual assistance, equality, and fraternal friendship, which greatly strengthens our strength, continuously consolidates Poland's international position, and makes it possible to play an active role in the struggle to consolidate peace in Europe. People's Poland stands in solidarity with the socialist camp against the arms race, especially against atomic armaments, against the construction of aggressive military bases on foreign territories, against the arming of the West German Bundeswehr, and against the "cold war" policy.

Gomułka stressed that the sinister role played by the Adenauer government and the militarist forces of the Federal Republic of Germany lies primarily in their attempts to obstruct the easing of international tensions by every possible means, to undermine any agreement between East and West, and to regard the German question as a fuse for igniting war. He said that today, every government that helps Adenauer arm a new Bundeswehr and hands over modern weapons of mass destruction to former Hitler generals must bear serious responsibility for the immeasurable and sinful consequences caused by this collusion. Gomułka emphasized that times have changed, and the balance of power between socialism and capitalism has shifted in our favor. The attempts of international reactionaries to weaken the unity of socialist countries have burst like soap bubbles. The unity of the socialist camp has been strengthened on the basis of Leninist proletarian internationalism.

Gomułka said that the Soviet Union's consistent position representing all socialist countries in Geneva not only showed the world its desire for a peaceful solution, but also adopted a correct and partial solution to major European issues such as the German question and the adjustment of the status of West Berlin, which is a very realistic effort.

Gomułka pointed out that the key issue for peace in Europe is the denuclearization of Germany. The Polish proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe is based on this proposition. This proposition has won the recognition and sympathy of the vast public worldwide. There is no doubt that the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Europe will open up the possibility of easing tensions in Europe, creating an atmosphere of mutual trust, and developing peaceful cooperation among countries.

Gomułka said that People's Poland has embarked on a new path in its historical development, linking its destiny with socialism and the liberation struggle of the working masses and oppressed peoples. We have firmly entered the orbit of the new socialist world, the orbit of the new socio-economic structure. Its victory over capitalism is inevitable, just as capitalism's victory over feudalism was inevitable in the past. Today, this is no longer a theoretical prediction, but a matter of social practice on a world scale.

Gomułka finally emphasized that our task is to accelerate this victory. This is also in the vital interests of our country and our people. We must accomplish this task in the most outstanding way, and we must do our best to strengthen and improve our socialist relations of production and use the life and labor practices of our people to prove the superiority of socialist economy and culture.

    哥穆尔卡在波兰国庆大会上讲话
    波兰十五年成就显示社会主义无比优越
    波苏友谊是工业化重要因素和国家安全保障
    新华社22日讯　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡21日在波兰人民共和国国庆十五周年庆祝大会上讲了话。
    哥穆尔卡在讲话中首先回顾了人民波兰建立的历史。他说，十五年，在人民的历史上是一个比较短促的时期，但是，最近十五年所发生的变化比过去历史时代中的几十年、甚至几百年所发生的变化还要大。他指出，人民波兰劳动人民十五年努力的成果同资本主义的波兰的十五年的成果的对比，是社会主义优越性的最好的证明，是对资本主义的无可辩驳的诉状。
    人民波兰建国的十五年同资产阶级波兰的十五年相比，我们所开采的煤增加了一倍多，所生产的钢和水泥增加了三倍多，糖增加了一倍多，棉织品增加了半倍多。
    按人口平均计算，1958年我国工业生产和1937年相比，电力增长了七倍，煤增长两倍，钢几乎增长了四倍，机床增长了五倍，硫酸几乎增长了三倍，氮肥增长了七倍，棉布增长了一倍多，丝织品增长了四倍，糖增长了一倍半。
    人民波兰出现了很多崭新的、标志着工业技术水平质的飞跃的工业部门，如：化学合成工业、造船工业、汽车及拖拉机工业、航空工业、大批的无线电技术工业、大型电机制造业、制铝工业、人造纤维制造业等。
    国家的全部社会经济结构发生了根本的变化：战前三分之二的居民的生活来源是靠农业，现在，农业人口仅占42％。
    在工业总产量几乎增长为六倍的情况下，工人的数目增加了两倍多。这标志着在人民中工人阶级比重的急剧增长，同时也标志着社会劳动生产率的大大提高。
    同战前时期相比，每一百公顷土地的农产品增加了50.5％，同时，每一百公顷土地上的农业人口减少三分之一。
    哥穆尔卡接着说，波兰经济的蓬勃发展大大缩短了我国同经济上最发达的欧洲国家的距离。1937年，波兰的钢产量按人口平均计算只等于当时法国钢产量的五分之一，当时德国钢产量的十分之一，而今天，波兰的钢产量已等于法国现在产量的60％，等于西德的41％。发电量指标的情形也与此相似。在燃料生产方面，我国的战前水平比法国要低，比德国低四分之三。现在，我们大大超过了法国，并且接近了西德的水平。在硫酸、水泥、棉纱和人造纤维生产方面，我们同这两个国家的距离缩短了二分之一或三分之二。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们属于社会主义阵营，我们是经济互助委员会的成员，从人民波兰诞生之日起，全面的经济关系把我们同苏联和其他社会主义国家联系在一起，所有这些过去现在都是这样一个因素，没有这个因素，我国的工业化是不可想像的。十五年以来，我们投入生产的工业项目，使用的机器设备，有70％以上是我们通过供货的手续从苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国得到的。有人曾经相信，波兰如果留在资本主义世界内，它的整个经济也能得到恢复和发展，他们是太天真了。在波兰经济现代化和发展方面，指望资本主义大国的援助是十分不现实的，这正像1939年指望它们帮助反对希特勒侵略一样。
    哥穆尔卡说，回顾十五年，我们可以满怀信心地说，我国人民在这些年代里所表现的努力和忘我精神受到了嘉奖。这种努力和忘我的精神带来了丰硕的果实。完成了一个跃进，这个跃进改变了我国的面貌，从根本上扩大了它的生产力。
    如今，我们依靠过去的经验和新的、更丰富的经济潜力，可以提出新的任务。今后七年的任务就其规模来说将大大超过最近十年来所取得的成就。
    哥穆尔卡又说，在人民波兰建立后的十五年期间，不仅我国的经济面貌和社会面貌发生了变化，波兰在欧洲的作用也起了根本性的变化。新波兰——人民的波兰和具有新的公正边界的、独立的波兰，今天是社会主义世界的堡垒之一，是各国和各国人民（不管它们的社会制度如何）进行和平合作的思想的始终如一的捍卫者。友好、合作和互助的纽带把我们同我们的所有邻国联系在一起。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们的边境是安全的和不可侵犯的，波苏两国牢不可破的友谊是这一点的保障。强大的华沙条约的联合力量在捍卫着我国人民和平的创造性劳动。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们属于根据国际主义、互助、平等和兄弟友谊的原则联合起来的社会主义阵营的一员，这就大大地增强了我们的力量，使波兰的国际地位不断巩固，并有可能在巩固欧洲和平的斗争中发挥主动性。人民波兰同社会主义阵营各国团结一致，反对军备竞赛，特别是反对原子军备、反对在别国领土上建立侵略性的军事基地，反对武装西德国防军，反对“冷战”政策。
    哥穆尔卡着重指出，阿登纳政府和德意志联邦共和国军国主义势力所起的险恶作用首先在于，它们千方百计地阻挠缓和国际紧张局势，企图破坏东西方之间达成任何协议，并把德国问题看成燃起战火的火苗。他说，今天，凡是帮助阿登纳武装新的国防军、把大规模毁灭性的现代化武器交给前希特勒将领的每一个政府，都要对这种勾当所造成的不可估量的罪恶后果负严重的责任。哥穆尔卡强调说，时代已经变了，社会主义和资本主义之间力量的对比已经发生了有利于我们的变化。国际反动派想削弱社会主义国家团结的企图像肥皂泡一样破灭了。社会主义阵营的团结在列宁主义的无产阶级国际主义的基础上加强了。
    哥穆尔卡说，苏联在日内瓦代表所有社会主义国家的一致的立场，不仅向世界表明了和平解决问题的愿望，而且对德国和调整西柏林的地位等重大欧洲问题，采取了正确的局部解决的办法，这是一种非常现实的努力。
    哥穆尔卡指出，欧洲和平的关键问题是德国非原子化的问题。波兰提出的关于在中欧建立无原子区的计划就以这一主张为基础。这一主张博得了全世界广大公众的公认和同情。毫无疑问，在欧洲建立无原子区将会打开缓和欧洲紧张局势的可能性，将会造成互相信任的气氛和发展各国的和平合作。
    哥穆尔卡说，人民波兰已走上它历史发展的新的路程，把自己的命运同社会主义和劳动群众以及被压迫人民的解放斗争联系在一起。我们坚定地进入了社会主义新世界的轨道，进入了新的社会经济结构的轨道。它对资本主义的胜利是不可避免的，这就和从前资本主义对封建主义的胜利是不可避免的一样。如今这已不是一个理论预测的问题，而是一个世界范围内的社会实践问题了。
    哥穆尔卡最后强调说，我们的任务是加速这个胜利。这也是符合我国和我国人民的切身利益的。我们要最出色地完成这个任务，要尽我们最大的努力来加强和改善我国的社会主义生产关系，用我国人民的生活和劳动实践来证明社会主义经济和文化的优越性。
