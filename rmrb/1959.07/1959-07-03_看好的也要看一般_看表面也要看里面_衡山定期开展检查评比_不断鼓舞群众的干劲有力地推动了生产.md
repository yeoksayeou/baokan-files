    Look at the good, but also look at the average; look at the surface, but also look inside.
    Hengshan regularly conducts inspections and evaluations.
    Constantly boosting the masses' enthusiasm and powerfully promoting production.
    (Our report) The CCP Hengshan County Committee in Hunan Province has continued to utilize and develop the effective experience of inspection, evaluation, and competition from the Great Leap Forward last year. It conducts monthly inspections and evaluations in stages throughout the county, constantly boosting the masses' enthusiasm and powerfully promoting production. Currently, the 400,000 mu of early rice and 360,000 mu of mid-season rice in the county are generally growing well. Communes are seizing the opportunity to strengthen field management and enthusiastically launching a bumper harvest campaign to produce 1,000 jin of grain per mu.
    Each time Hengshan conducts inspections and evaluations this year, it announces the conditions for inspection and evaluation one month in advance. These conditions are determined by the county committee based on the overall production situation in the county, after thorough research and consultation with the first secretaries of each commune party committee. The content is specific, and the direction is clear. The evaluation adopts a scoring method, with important tasks that need to be grasped urgently accounting for more points, and less important tasks accounting for fewer points, reflecting the principle of combining the central task with general tasks. For example, in the June evaluation, early and mid-season rice field management accounted for 60 points, preparatory work for harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice accounted for 20 points, and other cash crops, sideline production, etc., accounted for 20 points. The announcement of each inspection and evaluation content has effectively become a concrete arrangement by the county committee for the next month's work. Communes and production brigades concentrate their efforts on the work to be inspected. Many commune cadres reflected: In the past, we often did work like "cooking pumpkins and eggplants in one pot." Now the county committee announces the inspection content in advance each month, the direction is clear, and the work is more proactive.
    In organizing inspections and evaluations, the Hengshan County Committee not only looks at the good but also at the average; it not only looks at the "surface" but also looks "inside." Each inspection team, upon arriving at a commune, adopts a combination of cursory and in-depth inspections, selecting different types (advanced, average, and backward) of production teams for thorough examination. When inspecting the work on fertilizer, they not only look at the quantity but also the quality; when inspecting seedlings, they look not only along the roads and in the fields but also in the mountain gullies and depressions, those less conspicuous places. The inspection team not only looks at the completion of various tasks but also at the working methods used to complete the tasks. When inspection teams discover advanced experiences, they promptly summarize and promote them. When they discover problems, they promptly help solve them, so that work is implemented step by step, which both boosts the enthusiasm of the masses and reduces subjectivism and formalism in leadership work.
    Hengshan County has conducted a county-wide inspection and evaluation every month since January this year, and now inspection and evaluation have become regularized. Each month's inspection and evaluation has results, and each result, along with the next inspection content, is printed and distributed to each work group and announced in the county newspaper. Once the results are announced, the communes in the lead mobilize the masses to carry out discussions, inspiring the masses to forge ahead and strive for the top. Therefore, a regular competition to catch up with each other has been launched among the various communes in the county. In each inspection and evaluation, advanced experiences are discovered, promptly summarized, and promoted. In an inspection and evaluation in May, it was discovered that the field management of Shaquan Commune was well done, so it was promptly summarized, and this experience was promoted throughout the county, further strengthening the field management of early and mid-season rice.

    看好的也要看一般　看表面也要看里面
    衡山定期开展检查评比
    不断鼓舞群众的干劲有力地推动了生产
    本报讯　中共湖南衡山县委今年继续运用并发展了在去年大跃进中行之有效的检查评比竞赛的经验，在全县范围内按月分段进行检查评比，不断鼓舞群众干劲，有力地推动了生产。目前全县四十万亩早稻和三十六万亩中稻，普遍生长良好，各公社正抓紧田间管理，热烈开展亩产粮食千斤的丰产运动。
    衡山今年每次开展检查评比时，都在一个月前公布检查评比条件。这些条件是县委从全县生产情况出发，经过充分研究，并征求各公社党委第一书记意见后定下来的，内容具体，方向明确。评比采取计分办法，当前急需抓的重要工作占分多，次要的工作占分少，体现了中心与一般相结合的原则。比如6月份的评比，早中稻田间管理占六十分，收早稻插晚稻的准备工作占二十分，其它经济作物、副业生产等占二十分。这样每次检查评比内容的公布，实际上成了县委对下一月工作的具体安排。各公社、生产大队对于要检查的工作，就集中力量去抓。不少公社干部反映：以前我们做工作往往是“南瓜茄子一窝煮”，现在县委每月事先公布检查内容，方向明确，工作主动了。
    衡山县委在组织检查评比中，不仅看好的，而且看一般的；不仅看“表面”，而且看“里面”。各个检查组每到一个公社，采取走马观花与下马观花相结合的办法，选择不同类型（先进、一般和落后）的生产队进行深入检查。在检查肥料这项工作时，不仅看数量，而且看质量；检查禾苗，不仅看公路旁、田垅里，还看山冲，山坳这些不当眼的地方；检查组不仅看各项工作的完成情况，而且看完成任务的工作方法。检查组发现了先进经验，便及时总结推广，发现了问题，便及时帮助解决，使工作步步落实，既鼓舞群众干劲，也减少了领导工作中的主观主义和形式主义。
    衡山县自今年1月以来，每月进行了一次全县性的检查评比，现在检查评比已经经常化了。每月检查评比都有结果，每次结果随同下一次检查内容印发给各个作业组，并在县报公布。每次结果一公布，站在前头的公社发动群众开展讨论，激发群众勇往直前，力争上游。因此，在全县各公社与公社之间，开展了经常性的你追我赶竞赛运动。在每次检查评比中，发现了先进经验，便及时总结推广。在5月份的一次检查评比中，发现沙泉公社田间管理搞得好，便及时进行了总结，并在全县推广了这个经验，进一步加强了早、中稻的田间管理。
