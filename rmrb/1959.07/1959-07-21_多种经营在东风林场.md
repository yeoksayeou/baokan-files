　　Diversified Operations at Dongfeng Forest Farm
　　Lang Qingshan Gao Hongshu

　　Early morning, a thin mist lingers, and the peaks are beautiful. In the distant mountain valleys, puffs of white and black smoke rise. People who live here know at a glance that the lumber mill and forest chemical plant attached to the Dongfeng Forest Farm have begun another day of production.

　　At the end of June, we took a forest narrow-gauge train to the Dongfeng Forest Farm. Several wooden board houses and mud-grass houses are located beside a small river. The spacious courtyard is paved with thick yellow sand, and swings, merry-go-rounds, and basketball hoops are set up in the yard. Wooden propaganda boards and blackboard bulletins are neatly arranged on both sides of the path. A group of children is singing "Socialism is Good," and the families of the workers are sitting by the stream washing calico shirts. In the distance, the shouts of the lumberjacks felling trees can be faintly heard. … All this gives newcomers a simple and beautiful impression.

　　Wang Zongshan, the director of the forest farm, received us. He introduced us to the comprehensive utilization of forest resources in detail. Originally, the main targets given to this forest farm by the higher authorities this year were only two major items: one was to produce 53,000 cubic meters of timber; the other was to artificially renew 180 hectares of logging areas. However, at that time, the workers felt that the country's demand for timber had increased particularly rapidly in recent years, and no matter how much the forest farm was expanded, it would not be able to meet this need. At the same time, in their work, they also discovered such an unreasonable phenomenon: the timber was transported away, but a lot of forest resources were abandoned on the mountains and wasted. Therefore, the workers here have long had a wish: to make full use of forest resources for national construction, without losing a single bit.

　　This good wish has begun to become a reality this year at the Dongfeng Forest Farm. The Party organization here leads the broad masses of workers and staff to win victory by expanding the scope of forest resource utilization in many ways. In the past six months, on the basis of overfulfilling the plans for timber production and forest renewal, four or five timber processing plants and forest chemical plants have been established. They use fallen trees, pine roots, tree bark, etc., to produce more than 1,000 cubic meters of finished products such as light rail sleepers and box boards, and more than 7,100 shovel handles; the total amount of rosin, turpentine, and charcoal produced is more than 40,000 kilograms.

　　Hearing this, we had a new impression of this simple mountain village: the environment is beautiful, and the people are even more beautiful!

　　Dongfeng Forest Farm has taken a detour in the past in its efforts to comprehensively utilize forest resources. In the past, some people believed that doing this kind of thing was troublesome and complicated, and that it required large factories, foreign equipment, and new technologies to be able to do it. Therefore, they had to wait, and the waste of resources continued.

　　The mass movement of making steel in 1958 brought new inspiration to the leaders of this forest farm. They began to realize that even advanced products like steel could be obtained by indigenous methods, so why couldn't forest chemicals and comprehensive timber utilization be done by indigenous methods? Since then, they have turned their attention to small indigenous groups and put forward the call to the workers to start with indigenous methods, simplify as much as possible, focus on small scale, and strive for practical results, followed by a creative and hard work by the workers.

　　During our stay at the Dongfeng Forest Farm, we visited the timber processing plant and the forest chemical plant more than once. There we saw the concrete image of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. The factory building of the timber processing plant is nailed together with a layer of wooden boards, the windows have not yet been fitted with glass, and there is no floor in the room, but it is paved with yellow soil. The only power machine in the whole plant is still the old equipment allocated by the Yitong Forestry Bureau. The factory's chimney should be made of cast iron pipes or concrete, but the people here use old oil drums welded together to replace it. Fearing that the chimney would not be able to withstand the wind after it was erected, the workers also used three small rails to help it on the outside. They said that this was to add "steel tendons and iron bones" to the chimney. All the equipment in this factory is nothing more than a small band saw, two small circular saws and one large circular saw. A group of girls and a few young men use this equipment to process more than 30 cubic meters of waste materials such as broken pieces, treetop wood, and large branches picked up from the mountain site into various small sleepers, box boards, laths, shovel handles and other useful materials every day.

　　In the past, we have visited many chemical factories, but we have never seen a forest chemical plant with such simple equipment as the one run by Dongfeng Forest Farm. They use large iron pots to boil pine roots to extract good rosin, and use wooden barrels (sitting on iron pots) to distill pine needles and tree bark to extract high-grade aromatic oils and tannins and other forest chemical products. Here, the small indigenous groups showed their due role!

　　Dongfeng Forest Farm is one of the nearly one hundred forest farms in the Yichun forest area. The forest operation area reaches more than 3,000 hectares, and it is now moving towards a direction of comprehensive utilization and diversified operations.

　　Because this forest farm has developed diversified operations, the forest here has been rationally utilized to the greatest extent. After the pine trees are felled, the dry wood is transported to the timber storage yard as construction timber for the country, and the remaining pine roots, needles, branches and other waste small materials are used to their best advantage and processed into useful finished products and various oils. In this way, each hectare of forest farm produces at least 25 to 40 cubic meters more timber than before, and the forest by-products are not included. Diversified operations and comprehensive utilization have enabled the production of Dongfeng Forest Farm to enter a new stage.

    多种经营在东风林场
    郎青山　高红书
    清晨，薄雾弥漫、群峰秀丽。远处的山坳间升起一团团白气和黑烟。生活在这里的人们一眼望去就知道，东风林场的靠山制材厂和林产化工厂一天的生产又开始了。
    6月底，我们乘坐森林小火车来到了东风林场。几座木板房、泥草房座落在小河旁。宽阔的庭院铺着厚厚的黄砂，院中设立了秋千架、转环、篮球架。木制的宣传牌、黑板报整齐地排列在甬道两侧。一群孩子在唱“社会主义好”的歌曲，职工家属坐在溪间洗涤花布衫，远处隐约传来工人伐木的喊山声。……这一切，给初来的人以朴素、优美的印象。
    林场主任王宗山接待了我们。他向我们详细地介绍了综合利用森林资源的情况。原来，这个林场今年上级给的主要指标只有两大项目，一个是生产木材五万三千立方米；另一个是人工更新一百八十公顷采伐迹地。可是当时工人们觉得，这几年国家需要木材的数量增加的特别快，无论怎样扩大林场也满足不了这种需要。同时在劳动中他们又发现了这样不合理的现象：木材被运走了，还有很多的森林资源却遗弃在山上白白浪费掉。因此，这里的工人长久以来就有这样一种愿望：把森林资源全部利用到国家建设上去，一点也不丢掉。
    这种良好的愿望，今年在东风林场开始变成了现实。这里的党组织领导广大职工，从多方面扩大森林资源利用范围赢得了胜利。在过去的半年时间内，在木材生产和森林更新都超额完成计划的基础上，建立起四、五处木材加工厂和林产化学厂，用倒木、松根、树皮等，生产出轻轨枕木、箱板等成材一千余立方米、锹把七千一百多个；提炼松香、松节油和烧制木炭总量达四万余公斤。
    听到这些，对这个朴素的山村又有了新的印象：环境优美，人更美！
    东风林场在过去搞森林资源综合利用曾走过一段弯路。过去有些人认为干这种玩艺麻烦、复杂，需要大厂、洋设备、新技术，才能干得起来。因此只好等待下去，资源的浪费也继续下去。
    1958年大搞钢铁的群众运动，给这个林场的领导者带来了新的启示，他们开始认识到钢铁那种高级产品都能用土办法取得，林产化学、木材综合利用为什么不能用土办法呢。从此，把注意力转向了小土群，向工人们提出了土法上马、因陋就简、小型为主、力求实效的号召，接着是工人一场创造性的辛勤劳动。
    在东风林场期间，我们不止一次去参观过木材加工厂和林产化工厂。在那里我们看到了勤俭办企业的具体形象。木材加工厂厂房是用一层木板钉起来的，窗户上还没有来得及镶玻璃，室内没有地板，是用黄土垫的。全厂唯一的动力机还是伊东林业局拨给的旧设备。工厂的烟囱，按要求应当是铸铁管或混凝土砌成的，但是这里的人们都用废旧的油桶焊接在一起来代用。深怕烟囱立起来抗不住风吹，工人们还用了三根小铁轨在外边帮上，他们说这是给烟囱增添“钢筋铁骨”。这个厂所有的设备不外是一个小带锯、两个小圆锯和一个大圆锯。一群姑娘和几个小伙子就用这些设备，每天把从山场上拣下来的碎柈子、梢头木、大枝丫等三十多立米废料，加工出各种小枕木、箱子板、灰条子、锹把等成用的材料。
    以前，我们参观过不少化学工厂，但从没有看到像东风林场办起来的这样设备简单的林产化工厂。他们用大铁锅煮松根浸提出好松香，用木桶（坐在铁锅上）蒸馏松针叶、树皮，从中提出高级芳香油和拷胶等多种林化产品。在这里，小土群显示了它应有的作用！
    东风林场，是伊春林区近百个林场中的一个。森林作业面积达三千多公顷，现在正向一个综合利用，多种经营的方向迈进。
    这个林场由于开展多种经营，森林在这里得到了最大限度的合理利用。松树被伐倒后，干材被运到贮木场做为国家建设用材，余下的松根、针叶、枝丫等废材小料，又各尽其用，被加工成有用的成材和各种油脂。这样每公顷林场最少比以前多出二十五到四十立方米木材，而森林副产品还不在内。多种经营，综合利用，使东风林场生产跨进了一个新的阶段。
