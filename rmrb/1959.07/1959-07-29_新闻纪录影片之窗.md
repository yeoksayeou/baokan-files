Window on Newsreels

    Here, I introduce to readers several recently released newsreels:
    "Kite Master Wei"
    In Newsreel No. 37, we can see Wei Yuan-tai, a famous kite-making expert from Tianjin. This old craftsman is already eighty-seven years old this year. He started making kites at the age of sixteen and has been doing so for seventy-one years. He has meticulously made countless kites, but he has flown each one himself. The kites he makes are diverse in form, exquisite, and beautiful, and are highly praised by people, so people affectionately call him "Kite Master Wei." His descendants have inherited his career. "Kite Master Wei" is not only a kite-making expert but also an athlete in kite flying.
    "Fish Leaping Rapids"
    In Newsreel No. 41, the photographer captured the spectacle of fish leaping over the rapids at Shizitan on the Longxi River in Changshou, Sichuan. Since the construction of the artificial lake at the Shizitan power station, this spectacle has appeared when the season is right. First, two or three small fish jump out of the water, followed by ten or eight jumping in the rapids, jumping more and more, more and more vigorously, and soon it is like a myriad of arrows bursting forth, stars rushing past. Not many jump over the rapids, but those who don't give up and jump again. Some large fish fall on the rocks after jumping, but even if they fall with bloodstains, they continue to jump. This not only adds to people's enjoyment but also greatly increases the sideline income of the nearby Changshou Farm.
    "The Gadfly" Author Voynich
    The British female writer Ethel Lilian Voynich is the author of the novel "The Gadfly." She is already ninety-five years old this year. She now lives in New York, USA. In "World Events" No. 8, the audience can see the scene of Soviet ballet dancers on tour in the United States congratulating Voynich on her ninety-fifth birthday. "The Gadfly" has been published more than three million copies in the Soviet Union, and the Soviet ballet dancers brought the congratulations of millions of Soviet readers to Voynich.
    "The Eiffel Tower"
    There is a theme called "The Eiffel Tower" in "World Events" No. 9. This tower was built in Paris, France, in 1889. It is said that it was built at the suggestion of the engineer Eiffel, and therefore it is named after him.
    The Eiffel Tower is three hundred meters high, with one thousand seven hundred and ten steps. It was the tallest building in the world at that time. It shows the magnificent spirit of the capital's construction during the heyday of France. It is said that thirty-five million travelers have visited this tower in seventy years. In the film, you can see circus performers performing thrilling performances there, and you can also see the scene where people used to conduct flight tests on the platform of the tower before the invention of airplanes.
    The Eiffel Tower has its glorious history, but it also has its shameful page. The film records the defilement of it by the German fascist bandits. Now, next to it is the matchbox-like building of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization office, where a small group of warmongers live, which insults the Eiffel Tower once again.
    "Zhoushan Gongs and Drums"
    "Zhoushan Gongs and Drums" is one of the performance programs prepared by the Chinese Youth Art Troupe to participate in the 7th World Youth Festival. This piece of music is full of vigor and enthusiasm. It is popular in the Zhoushan area. It was warmly welcomed by the audience when it was performed in Beijing. Newsreel No. 41 recorded the tense and interesting scene of the performance of this piece of music, along with a recording of the music. (Attached picture)

    新闻纪录影片之窗
    吴楠
    在这里，介绍给读者几个最近上映的新闻影片：
    “风筝魏”
    在第三十七号“新闻简报”中，我们可以看到天津市著名的做风筝能手魏元泰。这个老艺人今年已八十七岁了。十六岁他就开始做风筝，至今已有七十一年历史。他精心制作的风筝不计其数，但每一个都经他自己放过。他做的风筝形式多样，精致美观，备受人们赞赏，因此人们都亲切地叫他“风筝魏”。他的后辈继承了他的事业。“风筝魏”不仅是做风筝的能手，也是放风筝的运动健将。
    “鱼跃险滩”
    在第四十一号“新闻简报”中，摄影师拍下了四川长寿龙溪河狮子滩鱼跃险滩的奇观。自从狮子滩修了电站的人工湖以后，季节适宜的时候奇观就出现了。先是两三条小鱼跳出水面，接着是十条八条在急流处跳起来、越跳越多、越跳越猛，不久便如万箭迸发、群星疾驰。跳过险滩的并不多，跳不过的却不灰心，回头再跳。有些大鱼跳起来以后跌在岩石上，即使跌得血痕斑斑也在所不惜，继续跳。这不但给人们增加眼福，还给附近的长寿农场增加了很大的副业收入。
      “牛虻”作者伏尼契
    英国女作家伏尼契是小说“牛虻”的作者。今年她已经九十五岁了。现在她住在美国纽约。在第八号“世界见闻”中，观众可以看到正在美国巡回演出的苏联芭蕾舞演员去祝贺伏尼契九十五岁诞辰的情景。“牛虻”在苏联已发行了三百多万册，苏联芭蕾舞演员给伏尼契带去了苏联千百万读者的祝贺。
      “艾菲尔铁塔”
    第九号“世界见闻”中有一个主题叫“艾菲尔铁塔”。这座铁塔在1889年建于法国巴黎。据说它是工程师艾菲尔倡议修建的，因此，也就用他的名字命名。
    艾菲尔铁塔高三百公尺，有一千七百一十级阶梯，是当年世界上最高的建筑物。它显示出法兰西全盛时期首都建设的宏伟气魄。据说，七十年来有三千五百万旅行者参观过这个铁塔，影片中可以看到马戏演员在那里进行惊险的表演，还可以看到当飞机还没有发明之前，曾经有人在铁塔的洋台上进行飞行试验的情景。
    艾菲尔铁塔有它光荣的历史，但也有它耻辱的一页。影片记录下了德国法西斯强盗对它的沾污。现在，它的旁边是北大西洋公约国办事处的洋火盒似的房子，那里住着一小撮战争贩子，这使艾菲尔铁塔又一次蒙受侮辱。
          “舟山锣鼓”
    “舟山锣鼓”是我国青年艺术团准备参加第七届世界青年联欢节的演出节目之一。这支乐曲朝气蓬勃，热情洋溢，它流传于舟山一带，在北京演出时受到观众热烈欢迎，“新闻简报”第四十一号中，纪录下了这支乐曲演出时紧张、有趣的情景，同时有乐曲录音。（附图片）
