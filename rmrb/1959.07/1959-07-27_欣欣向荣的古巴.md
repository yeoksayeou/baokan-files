    Flourishing Cuba
    Yao Zhen, Head of the Chinese Journalists Delegation

    During our visit to Cuba, we strongly felt the people's overflowing revolutionary fighting will and their revolutionary enthusiasm. The vast majority of workers, farmers, soldiers, students, and national leaders are working diligently and resolutely. Here, new things are growing vigorously, radiating hope everywhere. We intimately felt the pulse of history here. Cuba is developing prosperously, and the Cuban people are creating a new page in their history.

    The continuously developing Cuban national democratic revolution has now reached a new high tide. To defend and develop the fruits of the revolutionary victory achieved at the beginning of this year, Cuba's patriotic democratic forces are increasingly uniting, resolutely launching a struggle against U.S. intervention, and resolutely carrying out land reform. We met with hundreds of people from all walks of life in Cuba, from government ministers to ordinary residents, from workers in work clothes to soldiers holding weapons. They all unanimously emphasized that Cuba will never allow foreign interference, and the Cuban people will not hesitate to realize their national democratic revolution. Recently, the United States shamelessly used the "Organization of American States" and Cuba's reactionary forces to put pressure on the Cuban government and people, which aroused national indignation in Cuba. We recently listened to two reports by Prime Minister Castro. When Castro fiercely condemned the American interventionists, all the participants stood up, chanted slogans, and gave prolonged applause, which fully demonstrated the firm will of the Cuban people. A Cuban student leader told us that U.S. imperialists have become the most hated people by the Cuban people. As Prime Minister Fidel Castro said in his report on the 11th of this month: traitors are only a tiny minority; and the Cuban people, with their six million united people, are the most important guarantee of the final victory of the revolution.

    Land reform has become the most significant event in the lives of the Cuban people. Everywhere, land reform is being talked about, and land reform propaganda materials are being posted or exhibited. The people across the country applaud the government's takeover of foreign large estates. The heated debates at the land reform debate meetings continued until late at night, with representatives from ninety-one parties, organizations, institutions, and schools participating in the debates. The person in charge of the debate meeting told us that in the more than ten days of debate, the representatives of the Cuban large estate owners dared not openly oppose land reform. We visited a large-scale agricultural and livestock exhibition focusing on land reform and cooperativization. The exhibition attracted people from all walks of life who lined up in droves under the scorching sun to visit and receive the most vivid and figurative education. Inside and outside the exhibition, many young students raised funds for land reform through charity sales, which were very successful. Thousands of tractors and other agricultural implements were displayed in many squares and streets in the capital. These were gifts from urban residents to their farmer brothers in support of rural land reform and cooperativization. The revolutionary army is filled with the atmosphere of land reform. The vast majority of officers and soldiers are farmers in military uniforms, and they are a strong force in supporting land reform. In the office of Nuñez Jiménez, the director of the National Land Reform Committee, we met Cienfuegos, the Chief of Staff of the Rebel Army. He told us that he goes to the National Land Reform Committee every week to express the army's support for land reform and to strengthen the connection between the army and land reform work. In fact, thanks to the support of the Cuban people and the revolutionary army, Cuba's land reform has become an irresistible torrent.

    The Cuban people have realized in actual struggle that there are obstacles on their path forward that can only be removed through great struggles. Today, the Cuban people are advancing victoriously, but their struggle is more complex than the war period before this year. Of course, the Cuban people are full of confidence in victory. They believe that they will definitely be able to defend and expand the fruits of the revolutionary victory. We have heard leaders from various departments in Cuba confidently say more than once that the pressure from U.S. imperialism and reactionaries is strong, but the power of the Cuban people to fight back against them is even stronger.

    The Cuban people's struggle is by no means isolated. During our visit to Latin American countries, we saw the people of these countries admiring the Cuban revolutionary cause. They regard the victory of the Cuban national democratic revolution as the pride of Latin America. At the land reform debate meeting, we witnessed many Latin American representatives and journalists supporting Cuba's land reform and expressing strong anger at the U.S.'s crude interference. The people of the entire Latin America and the world are standing on the side of the Cuban people.

    The Cuban people highly value the friendship of the Chinese people. They received us extremely warmly. Cubans ran over to shake our hands and hugged us tightly. When they learned that the Chinese people had held demonstrations to support the Cuban revolution and oppose foreign interference, people from all walks of life in Cuba expressed particular concern. In our conversations with many Cubans, we could find many similarities between Cuba and China almost every time. Indeed, the two countries are very similar in many ways. The friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples has an extremely solid foundation, and the friendly relations between the two peoples will surely develop greatly.

    欣欣向荣的古巴
    中国新闻工作者代表团团长　姚溱
    我们在访问古巴的时候，强烈地感到了人们洋溢着革命的战斗意志，充满着革命热情，绝大多数工人、农民、军人、学生和国家领导人孜孜不倦地和坚决地工作着。在这里，新生的事物在蓬蓬勃勃地成长，到处放射希望的光芒。我们在这里亲切地感到了历史脉搏的跳动，古巴正在欣欣向荣地发展，古巴人民正在创造着他们的历史的新的一页。
    继续发展着的古巴民族民主革命，现在到达了一个新的高潮。为了保卫和发展今年年初取得的革命胜利果实，古巴的爱国民主力量日益团结了起来，坚决展开反对美国干涉的斗争，并毅然决然地进行土地改革。我们同数以百计的古巴各界人士会了面，从政府部长到一般居民，从身穿工作服的工人到手持武器的战士。他们都一致强调指出，古巴决不允许外国干涉，古巴人民将毫不犹疑地实现他们的民族民主革命。近来美国无耻地利用“美洲国家组织”和古巴的反动势力向古巴政府和人民施加压力，这种做法激起了古巴全国的愤慨。最近我们听了卡斯特罗总理的两个报告。当卡斯特罗激烈地谴责美国干涉主义者的时候，与会者全体起立，高呼口号并报以经久不息的掌声，这充分表示了古巴人民的坚定意志。一位古巴的学生领导人对我们说，美国帝国主义分子已经成了古巴人民最憎恨的人。正如菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理在本月11日的报告中所说：叛徒只是微不足道的一小撮；而拥有团结一致的六百万人的古巴人民则是革命最后胜利的最重要的保证。
    土地改革已经成为古巴人民目前生活中最重大的事件。处处都在谈论土地改革，张贴或展览了土地改革的宣传品。全国人民对政府接管外国大庄园拍手称快。土地改革辩论会上的激烈辩论一直进行到深夜，参加辩论会的有九十一个政党、团体、机关和学校的代表。负责辩论会的人对我们说，在十多天的辩论中，古巴大庄园主的代表不敢公开地反对土地改革。我们参观了以土地改革和合作化为主要内容的大规模的农牧业展览会。展览会吸引了各个阶层的人成群结队地在烈日之下排队参观，接受最生动最象形化的教育。在展览会的里里外外，很多青年学生为支援土地改革进行义卖，成绩很大。首都很多广场和街道上都摆满了成千上万的拖拉机和其他农具，这是城市居民作为支援农村土地改革和合作化而送给他们的农民弟兄的礼物。革命军里面充满了土地改革的空气。绝大多数军官和士兵是穿上军装的农民，他们是支援土地改革的坚强的力量。在土地改革全国委员会主任努涅斯·希门尼斯的办公室里，我们遇到了起义军参谋长西恩富戈斯。他对我们说，他每星期到土地改革全国委员会去，表示军队对土地改革的支援，以及加强军队和土地改革工作的联系。事实上，由于古巴人民和革命军的支持，古巴的土地改革已经成为一股不可抗拒的巨流。
    古巴人民在实际斗争中体会到，在他们前进的道路上，存在着必须进行巨大的斗争才能扫除的障碍。今天古巴人民在胜利地前进，但是他们的斗争比今年以前的战争时期还要复杂。当然，古巴人民充满了必胜的信念，他们相信他们自己一定能保卫和扩大革命胜利的果实。我们不只一次地听到古巴各部门的领导人充满信心地说，美帝国主义和反动派的压力是强大的，但古巴人民反击它们的力量更强大。
    古巴人民的斗争绝不是孤立的。我们在拉丁美洲国家访问期间，看到了这些国家的人民对古巴革命事业的赞叹，他们把古巴民族民主革命的胜利看作拉丁美洲的骄傲。在土地改革辩论会上，我们亲眼见到，很多拉丁美洲的代表和记者支持古巴的土地改革，并对美国的粗暴干涉表示强烈的愤怒。整个拉丁美洲和全世界的人民都站在古巴人民这一边。
    古巴人民对中国人民的友谊给以很高的评价。他们极其热情地接待了我们。古巴人跑来和我们握手并紧紧地拥抱我们。当他们知道中国人民曾经游行示威支持古巴革命和反对外国干涉的时候，古巴各阶层人民都表示特别关切。在同许多古巴人的谈话中，我们几乎每次都可以找到古巴和中国的许多相同之点。确实，两国在许多方面都很相像。中古两国人民的友谊有着极其牢固的基础，两国人民的友好关系一定会大大发展。
