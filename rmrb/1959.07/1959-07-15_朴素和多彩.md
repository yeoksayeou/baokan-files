    Simplicity and Colorfulness
  　Shen Mingde
    The campaign to increase production and practice economy advocates thrift in personal life, but at the same time it also advocates that people should live a rich and colorful life and be in a good mood. At first glance, these two seem to be contradictory, but they are not.
    Personal life has two aspects: material life and spiritual life. In the ten years since liberation, with the development of productivity, people's material lives have been greatly improved, especially with the great leap forward last year, production developed greatly, and a bumper harvest was achieved. However, it still cannot keep up with the growing needs of 600 million people. Therefore, it is a conscious effort to be thrifty in personal life and deposit surplus money in the bank to support national construction. This is hardship and simplicity in material life.
    Hardship and simplicity is the glorious tradition of our revolution. Revolutionary predecessors were not afraid of any hardship in the long revolutionary struggle and were full of revolutionary optimism, advancing heroically with perseverance. This was the case in the past, and it is still the case now. At the recent PLA Arts and Literature Performance in Beijing, the performance of the generals' choir composed of generals was deeply moving. They sang with grandeur and poetic passion. This shows that the generals' lives are not only serious, hard-working, and tense, but also rich, colorful, lively, and happy. The glorious tradition of the generals' hard work will always be a model for us to learn from, and the generals' singing, full of revolutionary joy, and cultural life will always need to be inherited and carried forward by us.
    Spiritual life is diverse. Singing is one aspect, appreciating dramas, movies, and music is another, and visiting art works and exhibitions is another. Engaging in music and art creation and learning is also part of it. These not only enrich leisure life, but also cultivate the mind and body and cultivate optimism. Sports activities are active rest. Ice skating and skiing in winter, swimming and fishing in summer, outdoor ball games and track and field, and indoor dancing and chess are all beneficial activities. In addition, growing vegetables, planting trees, planting flowers, and raising poultry and livestock in spare time not only improves food, but also cultivates labor habits and beautifies the environment.
    Promoting the style of hard work and simplicity in material life, and making spiritual life richer and more colorful, these two complement each other. We Chinese have developed a good tradition of closely combining these two in thousands of years, especially in the revolutionary struggles of recent decades. This is precisely the manifestation of our love for life and our ability to arrange life well.

    朴素和多彩
  　沈明德
    增产节约运动中提倡个人生活的俭朴，但同时又提倡人们要生活得丰富多彩，心情舒畅，乍看起来这二者好像是矛盾的，其实不然。
    个人生活有两方面，一是物质生活，二是精神生活。我国解放十年来，随着生产力的发展，人民的物质生活有了极大的改善和提高，特别是去年大跃进，生产大发展，取得了特大丰收，但是它还赶不上六亿人民日益增长的需要，所以自觉的在个人生活上勤俭节约，把余钱存入银行支援国家建设，这就是物质生活上的艰苦朴素。
    艰苦朴素是我国革命的光荣传统，革命前辈在长期革命斗争中不畏任何艰辛困苦，充满了革命乐观精神，百折不挠地英勇前进。过去是这样，现在也仍这样。最近北京举行的解放军文艺会演大会上，由将军们组成的将军合唱团的演出，使人深受感动。他们唱得气壮山河而又诗情奔放。这说明将军们的生活不仅严肃、刻苦而紧张，同时也是丰富多彩而又活泼舒畅。将军们的艰苦奋斗的光荣传统永远是我们学习的榜样，将军们引吭高歌，充满了革命的欢乐的文化生活也永远需要我们继承发扬。
    精神生活是多样的，唱歌是，欣赏戏剧、电影和音乐也是，参观美术艺术作品和展览会也是，从事于音乐、艺术的创作和学习也是。这些不仅丰富了休息生活，而且也是陶冶身心，培养乐观精神。体育活动则是积极的休息，冬天溜冰滑雪，夏日游泳钓鱼，室外的球类田径，室内的跳舞下棋，都是有益的活动。此外在业余时间里种菜、植树、栽花、饲养家禽家畜不仅改善伙食，也培养了劳动习惯，还能美化环境。
    在物质生活上发扬艰苦朴素作风，在精神生活上更加丰富多采，这二者是相辅相成的。我们中国人在几千年特别是近几十年的革命斗争中养成了把这二者紧密结合的好传统。这正是我们热爱生活而又善于安排生活的表现。
