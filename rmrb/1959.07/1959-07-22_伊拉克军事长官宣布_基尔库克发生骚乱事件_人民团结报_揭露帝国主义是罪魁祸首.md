Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 20th: Iraqi Military Governor Abdi issued a communique on the evening of the 19th, stating: "In the past few days, some disturbances of public order have occurred in Kirkuk, resulting in fighting and damage to some shops." The communique said that "a special investigation committee has been sent there to identify the criminals and perpetrators" in order to punish them.

    On the same day, Prime Minister Qassem made a speech at St. Joseph's Church regarding this incident. He expressed his intention to "severely punish those who infringe upon the freedom of the people," especially in cities and villages like Kirkuk. He said: "Some people say that the enemies of the people must not be given freedom. To these people, we tell them that the enemies of the people are only known to the authorities and the law, not to individuals scattered everywhere spreading terror among the people." Qassem called for "my brothers to have a sense of security and not to pay attention to fabricated and exaggerated claims about so-called conspiracies or anything of that nature." Qassem also demanded that "army soldiers only obey orders issued to them by senior leadership institutions."

    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 20th: The Iraqi "People's Unity" newspaper published a commentary today stating that the bullets fired by the conspirators in Kirkuk were the beginning of implementing the imperialists' conspiracy against the Republic and the people.

    The newspaper pointed out that the Kirkuk rebellion was part of an imperialist conspiracy specially timed, which the imperialists and their lackeys had been planning for a long time. The newspaper cited evidence provided by the imperialist press and the United Arab Republic radio, which had long "predicted" that "dangerous events would occur on July 14."

    The newspaper pointed out that the rebellion was quickly suppressed due to the resolute and courageous performance of the army in cooperation with the people's resistance forces and all democratic organizations, as well as the masses from all walks of life in Kirkuk. The newspaper said that this resolute and courageous attitude is "the only effective way to crush the enemies of the Republic and another brilliant example."

    The newspaper emphasized that all democratic organizations and the masses in Kirkuk stood together in support of the armed forces.

    The newspaper pointed out that the suppression of this rebellion has given a new and effective lesson to those who dream of subverting the Republic.

    "Voice of Free Men" newspaper today published an editorial on the many armed attacks committed by reactionaries in various parts of Iraq. It pointed out that these criminals obtained the "freedom" to kill the people due to the complicity of officials. The newspaper said that some of the staff of the investigation committees established to investigate these incidents "are officials in collusion with the groups plotting the conspiracy."

    伊拉克军事长官宣布
    基尔库克发生骚乱事件
    “人民团结报”揭露帝国主义是罪魁祸首
    新华社巴格达20日电　伊拉克军事长官阿卜迪19日晚上发表公报说：“过去几天在基尔库克发生了一些扰乱治安的事件，造成了凶殴和使一部分商店遭受损害。”公报说，“已经派了一个特别调查委员会到那里去查明犯罪分子和肇事者”，以便惩办他们。
    同一天，卡塞姆总理在圣约瑟夫教堂就这个事件发表谈话。他表示要“严惩那些侵犯人民自由的人”，特别是在基尔库克等城市和乡村。他说：“有些人说，决不能给人民的敌人自由，对于这些人，我们告诉他们，人民的敌人只有当局和法律知道，而不是分散在各处在人民中间散布恐怖的个别人知道。”卡塞姆要求“我的弟兄们有安全感，不要理睬关于所谓阴谋或任何这类事情的捏造的和夸张的说法”。卡塞姆还要求“陆军士兵只遵守高级领导机构向他们发出的命令”。
    新华社巴格达20日电　伊拉克“人民团结报”今天发表评论说，基尔库克的阴谋者所发射的子弹是执行帝国主义者反对共和国和人民的阴谋的开始。
    报纸指出，基尔库克叛乱是特别选好时机的帝国主义阴谋的一部分，帝国主义者和他们的走卒策划这个阴谋已经很久了。这家报纸引证了帝国主义报刊和阿联电台所提供的证据：它们早就“预言”“在7月14日将发生危险的事件”。
    这家报纸指出，由于陆军部队在人民抵抗部队和所有民主组织以及基尔库克各阶层群众的合作下表现坚决果敢，叛乱被迅速镇压下去了。报纸说，这种坚决果敢的态度是“粉碎共和国敌人的唯一有效的办法和又一个光辉的范例”。
    报纸着重指出，基尔库克的所有民主组织和群众都站在一起支持武装部队。
    报纸指出，这次叛乱的平定给了那些梦想颠复共和国的人一个新的有效的教训。
    “自由人之声报”今天就反动派在伊拉克各地制造的许多武装袭击的事件发表了社论。它指出，这些犯罪分子由于有共谋的官员而获得杀害人民的“自由”。报纸说，为了调查这些事件而成立的调查委员会的一些工作人员“就是同策划阴谋的集团勾通的官员”。
