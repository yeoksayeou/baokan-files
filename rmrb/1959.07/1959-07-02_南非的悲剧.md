The Tragedy of South Africa

Editor's Note: On February 28th, the British "New Statesman" published a special article by Roland Segal, editor of "South Africa" magazine, entitled "South Africa's Horrifying Tragedy." Excerpts are as follows: "Accessories to Work"... The South African government believes that Johannesburg and all other land in South Africa, other than the indigenous reserves, belongs to white people. Johannesburg has become the largest black city on the African continent. However, legally, it belongs to white people, and only white people can own property and businesses there. Black people are merely accessories to work on the city streets, in factories, and in kitchens, and their dwellings are chaotic little houses at the end of the road leading from Johannesburg to the distant mountains.

A family of five lives on only sixteen pounds a month. Patients with edema, rickets, and infants dying of typhoid fever on the streets are everywhere. According to official estimates, the mortality rate is two to three hundred per thousand children. Only 50% of all Africans born in South Africa live to working age – sixteen years old.

Between 1947-1948 and 1957, the number of white people working in private manufacturing plants throughout South Africa increased from 129,000 to 202,000, an increase of 57.7%. However, the number of black people employed jumped from 200,000 to 367,000 in ten years – a sharp increase of 83.5%. There are almost twice as many Africans engaged in industry as white people, and this proportion is increasing daily.

The vast majority of African workers are employed in the lower-skilled sectors of allocation, municipal construction, machinery, and the automotive industry, where the average wage in 1954 was eleven pounds, eight shillings, and eleven pence per month. However, during the same period, a research institution stated that the minimum cost required for a five-member African family to maintain health averaged twenty-three pounds, ten shillings, and four pence per month. In the African areas of Johannesburg, 69% of families have a total income below the minimum level, and 44% of families earn less than fifteen pounds per month.

The gap between average wages and basic consumption is widening every month, to the point where just surviving is a remarkable achievement. Since 1954, the wages of unskilled African workers on five major streets have increased by an average of 8.3%. However, between 1954 and March 1958, the retail price index increased by 11.1%.

	"Reserves"

Today, 700,000 white people own and occupy 124,250,000 morgen of land (one morgen is approximately twelve mu), while over six million Africans are crammed into 17,250,000 morgen of land. In other words, 85% of the total agricultural population occupies 12.5% of the land, while 15% of the population owns 87.5% of the land.

The Native Trust owns all land in the native reserves. The native reserves consist of approximately 260 scattered areas of varying sizes and qualities, which are extremely overcrowded, and the soil is barren due to years of use. The Africans working in the reserves are merely tenants of the Trust, and therefore, in reality, tenants of the government. They can be evicted at any time. The last bit of productive capacity of these lands has been squeezed out, and these exhausted lands will deteriorate to the point of being completely unproductive. It is impossible to sustain the lives of millions of Africans on such barren and depleted farms, so Africans have no choice but to send their able-bodied men to white farms and urban areas to work. The government also levies a head tax on African men in the "reserves" between the ages of eighteen and sixty-five, which last year was one pound and fifteen shillings per person per year.

The "reserves" inevitably become homes for the old, the weak, women, and children. Men must flock to the cities. But in a country where white South African farmers are treated as aristocrats, the government tries every means to drive African laborers to the white rural areas, where the labor conditions are at best medieval.

In September 1949, the South African Minister of Justice, Swart, built the first private prison for agricultural laborers in the Piet Retief area. By 1950, there were seven such prisons in the area, and the inmates were hired out to farmers at a wage of two shillings per day. Similarly, the government has a system of hiring out prisoners serving short sentences to farms for labor at a wage of only nine pence per day.

	Pass Laws

The key to South Africa's control of labor and maintenance of white supremacy lies in the pass laws – documents that every African over the age of sixteen must carry at all times.

No African can remain in an urban area for more than seventy-two hours unless he has proof of employment or holds a special seven-day permit to seek work. The only Africans not subject to this restriction are those who were born and have lived in a certain urban area; have worked continuously for one employer for more than ten years; or have resided continuously in one place for at least fifteen years without being sentenced to more than seven days in prison. Any African who stays illegally in a region may be sentenced to a maximum fine of ten pounds and two months in prison for the first offense, and then banished to a permanent place of residence.

The government has also promulgated pass laws for African women, with the government's policy being to remove all "unnecessary" women from urban areas. These are women who are not necessary for domestic labor and industry, some secretly slip through government barriers to meet their husbands, or to work in the city to support their families.

This is a cruel picture. Through cheap black labor, industry and commerce reap substantial profits.

Once an African is permitted to enter an urban area, he has no stable life. He can only be safe if he remains a "single" migrant laborer who makes no protests. If he violates the thousands of legally stipulated details, he can at best hope to be sent back to the farm. There is no equality on the farm. The relationship between master and servant is still maintained. The number of Africans sentenced to imprisonment under the pass laws and related laws increased from 217,300 in 1950 to 337,600 in 1955. In the Union of South Africa, one in ten people (including women and children) commits a crime every year.

	Persecution of Unions

Complementing the pass laws are South Africa's industrial laws. African workers are not allowed to enter into collective contracts, their unions are not legally recognized, and all strikes are strictly prohibited under strict penalties. As soon as their unions show signs of genuine activity, the union organizers are immediately banned from activities or imprisoned on charges of inciting strikes.

The maximum penalty for a black strike is six months imprisonment or a fine of fifty pounds, but the boundary between a strike and a dispute is very vague in law, and even a protest made during working hours may be considered a stoppage of work and immediately arrested. Therefore, although African workers hate it in their hearts, they only rise up in revolt when the situation becomes truly unbearable. Thus, while white wages jumped from an average of thirty-seven pounds per month in 1947 to sixty-eight pounds in 1957, African wages increased only from nine pounds to thirteen pounds during the same period. There were thirty-three "illegal" strikes in 1954 and seventy-three strikes in 1955. But only fifteen strike incidents (and during a period of industrial prosperity) resulted in Africans obtaining higher wages or better working conditions.

There are 300,000 Africans and 30,000 white people working in the mines, but only white people have mine workers' union organizations. African miners come from various regions, and their migrant nature makes labor organization very difficult.

In 1956, Parliament also forced registered trade unions to implement racial segregation. Trade unions were forced to divide their members into white and colored branches. Regardless of whether the white people are in the majority in the union, only white people are qualified to be elected to the Executive Committee. Another amendment passed by Parliament prevents trade unions from belonging to or giving financial assistance to any political party. This is naked racial segregation and fascism.

	United Front

Approximately 1.3 million (9% of the total population) colored people are descendants of East Indian slaves. They are slightly better off than unskilled African workers. Their economic and political status is between black and white people. Colored people, who had long identified themselves as white people in the past, now have to carry identity cards for inferior citizens based on their birth certificates. The barrier of privilege between colored people and Africans has been broken down, and colored people also have to carry passbooks.

The purpose of the Group Areas Act of 1950 is, first, to reduce all non-white people to the status of despised, disenfranchised, and completely identical proletariat, and then to divide these slave armies into many manageable political units. This bill stipulates that different races must establish different residential and commercial areas, and the non-white races in South Africa must establish even smaller independent subdivisions.

Since 1950, political cooperation between Africans and Indians has greatly increased. This is a powerful alliance.

The National Congress Movement is an effective force against the government and die-hard white South Africa. It includes the African National Congress, the South African Indian Congress, the South African Colored People's Organization, the Congress of Democrats, and the South African Congress of Trade Unions. Among these five organizations, the African National Congress is naturally the most powerful, enjoying the mass support that the other collaborators do not obtain. But at the leadership level, there is a considerable degree of cooperation between the various organizations, and the policies followed by the African National Congress largely accommodate the opinions put forward by other members of the National Congress.

Although the African National Congress is a genuine mass movement, its leadership reflects the political demands of its grassroots. The African National Congress is a special organization of the majority of the black proletariat and has an active and influential left wing. South Africa's industrialization has inevitably produced an African left wing, and it has simultaneously produced an African proletariat. (Attached picture)

### 南非的悲剧

专栏：外论摘要

    南非的悲剧
    编者按　2月28日英国“新政治家”发表了“南非”杂志的编辑罗兰·西格尔的一篇特稿，题目是“南非的令人毛骨悚然的悲剧”。摘译如下：“工作的附属品”……南非政府认为约翰内斯堡以及南非其他所有的城市和土著保留地以外的所有土地都是白人的。约翰内斯堡成为非洲大陆上最大的黑人城市。然而在法律上它却是属于白人的，只有白人能在那里拥有财产和商业。黑人仅仅是城内街道上、工厂和厨房里的工作的附属品，他们的住处是在从约翰内斯堡直达远处山区的公路尽头的乱七八糟的小房子。
    一家五口人只靠十六英镑一个月的薪水过活。臌症患者、伛偻病患者和街头上由于伤寒而死的婴儿，到处皆是。根据官方的估计，每一千个儿童中死亡率是二百到三百。在南非出生的所有非洲人只有50％能活到可以劳动的年龄——十六岁。
    在1947—1948和1957年之间，南非各地私营制造厂工作的白人从十二万九千人增加到二十万零二千人，就是增加了57.7％。然而被雇佣的黑人的数字，在十年内从二十万人跃为三十六万七千人——陡增83.5％。从事工业的非洲人几乎比白人多一倍，这种比例还在逐日增加。
    绝大多数非洲职工都是在分配、市政建筑、机器和汽车工业中技术程度较低的部门中工作，这些行业在1954年的平均工资是每月十一英镑八先令十一便士。然而在同一时期中一个调查机构说，一个五口之家的非洲家庭为了维持健康所需的最低费用每月平均要二十三英镑十先令四便士。约翰内斯堡的非洲人地区的69％的家庭，全家的总收入还低于最低的水平，有44％的家庭每月收入不到十五英镑。
    平均工资与基本消费的差额每月都在扩大，直到后来活下去就算是一件了不起的成就。从1954年以来五条大街上的不熟练的非洲工人的工资平均增加了8.3％。但是在1954年到1958年3月之间零售物价的指数增加了11.1％。
          “保留地”
    今天七十万白人拥有和占有一亿二千四百二十五万摩根的土地（一摩根约为十二市亩），而超过六百万的非洲人却挤在一千七百二十五万摩根的土地以内。换句话说，全部农业人口的85％占有12.5％的土地，而15％的人口却拥有87.5％的土地。
    土著信托公司拥有土著保留地土地的所有权。土著保留地约包括二百六十个分散在各地的大小和质量不同的地区，那里的人口极其拥挤，由于连年使用，土壤贫瘠不堪。在保留地劳动的非洲人不过是信托公司的佃农，所以实际上也就是政府的佃农。他可能被人随时撵走。这些土地的最后一点生产能力都被榨干了，这些已经枯竭的土地将恶化到完全不能生产的程度。要这种贫瘠枯竭的农场来维持数百万非洲人的生活是不可能的，非洲人只好把他们的壮年男人送到白人农场和城区去做工。政府还对
  “保留地”年在十八岁到六十五岁的非洲男人征收人头税，去年每人一年的人头税就是一英镑十五先令。
      “保留地”不可避免地成为老、弱、妇、婴的家园。男人只有奔向城市。但是在一个以南非出生的白人农场主为贵族的国家里，政府千方百计地驱使非洲劳工走向白人的农村地区。那里的劳动条件最好的也只能说是中世纪的。
    1949年9月南非司法部长斯瓦特在培泰尔地带为农业劳工修建了第一所私人监狱，到1950年这个地区已有七个这样的监狱，其中被监禁的犯人以每天二先令的工资雇佣给农场主。与这种情况相似的是，政府把短期徒刑的犯人以每天仅仅九便士的工资把他们雇佣给农场去劳动的制度。
        通行证法
    南非对劳工的控制以及维持白人优势的关键在于通行证——每一个年过十六岁的非洲人必须随时随地携带的文件。
    没有一个非洲人可以在城市地区耽搁七十二小时以上，除非他有雇佣的证明或是持有一种为期七日的谋事特别护照。唯一不受这种限制的非洲人是那些在某一城区出生和长住的；连续十年以上为一个雇主工作的；或在一地连续居住至少十五年以上而没有一次被判处七天以上徒刑的。任何一个非洲人在一个地区非法停留，第一次可能被判处最高十英镑的罚款和两个月的徒刑而被放逐到永久的居留地去。
    政府对非洲妇女也颁布通行证的法律，政府的政策是要把城区一切“不必要的”妇女都清除出去。这就是那些不是仆役劳动和工业所必须的妇女，她们是一些偷偷溜过政府的路栅和他们的丈夫相会或是为了赡养家庭而到城市来工作的。
    这是一幅残酷的图景。通过廉价的黑人劳动，工商业饱赚肥厚的利润。
    非洲人一旦许可进入城市地区，他就没有安定的生活。他只有永远作为一个不提出任何抗议的、“独身的”移民劳工，才是安全的。要是他违反了法律上的千万条细节的规定，他最多只能盼望被赶回农场。在农场上是谈不到平等的。农场上仍然维持主仆的关系。在通行证法和有关的法律下被判处徒刑的非洲人的数字从1950年的二十一万七千三百人增加到1955年的三十三万七千六百人。在南非联邦每年每十个人（妇女和儿童也包括在内）就有一个人犯罪。
        迫害工会
    和通行证法相辅而行的是南非的工业法。非洲工人不得订立集体合同，他们的工会得不到法律的承认，一切罢工都在严格的惩罚下受到禁止。他们的工会刚刚表现出真正活动的迹象，工会的组织者马上就会在煽动罢工的罪名下被禁止活动或被投入狱中。
    黑人罢工的最高惩罚是六个月的徒刑或五十英镑的罚款，但罢工和一场争论之间的分界线在法律上是非常模糊的，甚至在劳动的时间内提出的一声抗议，可能被认为是停止工作而立刻加以逮捕。因此非洲工人虽然心内恨得咬牙切齿，他们只是在情况到了实在忍无可忍的地步才会起来反抗。因此在白人的工资从1947年每月平均三十七英镑跃为1957年的六十八英镑的时候，非洲人在同一时期的工资仅从每月九英镑增加到十三英镑。1954年发生了三十三起“非法”罢工，1955年发生了七十三次罢工。但是仅有十五次罢工事件（而且是在工业繁荣的时期），使非洲人获得了较高的工资或较好的劳动条件。
    有三十万非洲人和三万白人在矿山工作，可是只是白人有矿工工会的组织。非洲矿工来自各个地区，加上他们的移民的性质使劳工的组织工作非常困难。
    1956年议会又强使登记的工会实行种族隔离。工会被迫把成员分为白人和有色人的支部，不论白人是否在工会内属于多数，只有白人有资格被选入执委会，议会通过的另外一个修正案，使工会不能隶属于任何政党或给予任何政党以财政援助。这是赤裸裸的种族隔离的法西斯主义。
          统一战线
    约有一百三十万（占全人口9％）的有色人是东印度奴隶的后裔。他们比非洲不熟练的工人略高一筹。他们的经济和政治地位是介于黑白人之间。过去曾长时期以白人自居的有色人，现在不得不根据他们的出生证明书而携带低等公民的身份证。有色人与非洲人之间的一道特权的障碍被冲垮了，有色人也得携带通行证。
    1950年的种族地区法的目的首先是把全部非白人降低到遭到卑视的、毫无权利的、完全相同的无产阶级的地位，然后再把这些奴隶队伍分成许多易于管理的政治单位。这个法案规定不同的种族必须建立不同的居住区和商业区，而南非的非白人的种族还得再建立更小的独立分区。
    自从1950年以来，非洲人、印度人在政治方面的合作大大增加了。这是一种力量强大的联盟。
    国民大会运动是一支反对政府和死硬的白人南非的有效力量，它包括非洲人国民大会、南非印度人大会、南非有色人组织、民主人士大会和南非工会大会。在这五个组织中间，非洲人国民大会自然是势力最大的，它享有其他的合作者所没有获得的群众的拥护。但是在领导一级上，各个组织中间存在相当程度的合作，而非洲人国民大会所遵循的政策，大部分容纳了其他国民大会成员所提出的意见。
    非洲人国民大会虽然是一个真正的群众运动，它的领导中反映出它的基层的政治呼声，非洲人国民大会是大多数黑人无产阶级的特殊组织，并且拥有一个活跃而有影响的左翼。南非的工业化不可避免地产生了非洲的左翼，它同时产生了非洲的无产阶级。（附图片）
