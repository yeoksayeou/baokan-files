Inheriting Excellent Traditions by Eliminating the Dross and Retaining the Essence; Preserving Special Skills to Enrich People’s Lives
Many Shanghai Shops Promote Their Unique Business Features

(Our dispatch) Shanghai is actively maintaining and promoting the unique business features of some shops in the commercial and service industries, in order to enrich people’s lives.

Many commercial units in Shanghai have accumulated excellent business traditions over the years. Some are known for their special styles and specifications of goods, some are famous for their exquisite service techniques, and some are welcomed by consumers for their flexible and convenient service methods. For example, the Wuxiang Department Store is known for its novel shirt styles and its ability to customize shirts of special specifications for customers with special body types, which is well received by consumers. Shanghai Tent Company's tents and bedding, Shengxifu Store's hats, and Wang Xingji Fan Shop's fans are all well-known for their complete stock, which is convenient for customers to choose from. The long-established Old City God Temple Bazaar is known for its wide variety and complete range of small commodities. Among the shops that specialize in serving cultural and artistic groups, Lao Zhou Huchen's writing brushes and Cao Sugong (Yao Qianshi)'s high-grade ink are also famous far and wide. In the service industry, Shanghai's photography, laundry and dyeing, and bathing industries also have their own characteristics. For example, some photography studios are good at taking outdoor scenes, some are good at taking still life, and some are famous for enlarging and coloring. In addition to washing and ironing clothes, some laundry and dyeing shops also engage in repair business, and can mend holes in clothes "seamlessly". Shanghai also has many industries and shops famous for operating production materials and building decoration. Guo Zhiji Decoration Hardware Store in Huangpu District is the only one in Shanghai; the famous "Mantingfang" second-hand market is characterized by operating hardware parts; and Dafeng Hosiery Needle Store in Luwan District, which operates various hosiery needles, also has its own unique style. In addition, some hardware stores in Beijing East Road are characterized by operating various iron chains.

With the development of production and the improvement of people's living standards, many shops that used to serve a few people are now facing the public, and their business has grown significantly. However, due to the insufficient understanding of some commercial personnel on maintaining and developing the unique business features, insufficient attention is paid to taking care of the supply of goods, less of certain raw materials are allocated to self-produced and self-sold households that are both workers and businessmen, some measures were inappropriate in the economic restructuring, some shops have not fully maintained their original business characteristics, and the quality of some commodities has declined, failing to meet the needs of the people's ever-improving lives.

In order to promote these traditional business features, Shanghai commercial departments have recently conducted active investigation and research under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and have taken necessary measures based on the principle of eliminating the dross and retaining the essence. Many shops have also organized discussions among employees to make everyone realize the importance of maintaining business characteristics.

When allocating raw materials, commercial departments pay attention to supporting the production of certain traditional commodities; the employees of grassroots enterprises also try their best to open up sources of raw materials, while improving technology and using rough materials to produce high-quality products. The famous Daxingbin Shoe Store, Xinxin Shoe Store, and Lao Miaoxiangshi have respectively resumed the production of small-footed embroidered shoes for elderly women and eyebrow pencils for drama actors to meet the special needs of these customers. Since the beginning of this year, Lantang Leather Shoe Store has been using waste tires as the base for making leather shoes. The employees use steam hot pressing and other methods to flatten the tire base, and have now designed more than 200 new products with tire bases.

Many shops have restored their own workshops or improved processing methods, and their business characteristics have been promoted. Hengsheng, Renli, Lanling and other clothing stores have restored their original workshops, and the tailoring of high-end clothing is the sole responsibility of a tailor, promoting the characteristics of meticulous workmanship. Some production and sales relationships that had been interrupted by famous shops have now been gradually restored.

Many stalls in Shanghai continue to maintain and promote their original excellent traditions in terms of service methods. For example, some laundry and dyeing shops iron clothes for customers, and if customers need them urgently, they can be ironed out on the same day. Some leather shoe stalls and furniture repair stations set up fixed service points on the one hand, and send people to walk through the streets and alleys to provide mobile services on the other hand.

Shanghai commercial departments have strengthened the teaching of certain special skills and trained successors. The catering service industry has established a technical training class, selecting a group of young employees to participate in the study, and skilled barbers and chefs serve as teachers. In addition to attending lectures, the students also study with the teachers in shifts. Now, some apprentices have been able to design hairstyles according to the customer's face shape, skin color and age, and some have been able to initially master the teacher's cooking skills and cook famous dishes and snacks.

    去芜存菁继承优良传统　保存特技丰富人民生活
    上海许多商店发扬经营特色
    本报讯　上海市积极保持和发扬商业和服务行业某些商店的经营特色，以丰富人民的生活。
    上海许多商业单位有着长年积累起来的优良经营传统。有的以商品的花色、规格特殊著称，有的以服务技术精闻名，有的以服务方式灵活方便受到消费者欢迎。例如，万象百货店衬衫式样新颖，能够为特殊体型的顾客定制特殊规格的衬衫，得到消费者的好评；上海帐子公司的帐子和床上用品、盛锡福商店的帽子、王星记扇庄的扇子，都因备货齐全，便于顾客挑选而闻名。历史悠久的老城隍庙商场，则以备有种类繁多、花色齐全的小商品而著称。在专为文化艺术团体服务的商店中，老周虎臣经营的水笔，曹素功（尧千氏）的高级墨，也都远近驰名。在服务行业中，上海的照相、洗染和沐浴业等，也都各具特色，如有的照相馆善于拍外景，有的善拍静物，有的则以放大、着色著名。有些洗染店，除洗烫衣服以外，还兼营修补业务，能够把衣服上的破洞织补得“天衣无缝”。上海还有许多以经营生产资料和建筑装饰而著名的行业和商店。黄浦区的郭志记装璜五金店，上海只有一家；著名的“满庭芳”旧货市场，以经营五金零件为特色；卢湾区的大丰袜针商店，经营各种袜针，也独具风格。此外，像北京东路一带的五金商店，有的以经营各种铁链条为特点。
    随着生产的发展和人民生活水平的提高，不少过去为少数人服务的商店今天已面向大众，营业有了很大的增长。但是，由于部分商业人员对保持和发扬商业经营特色的认识不足，在货源分配上注意照顾不够，对亦工亦商自产自销户所需要的某些原材料分配得少了一些，在经济改组中有些措施不当，部分商店没有完全保持住原来的经营特色，一部分商品质量有所下降，不能适应人民生活日益提高的需要。
    为了发扬这些传统的经营特色，上海商业部门最近在中共上海市委领导下，积极调查研究，并且根据去芜存菁的原则采取必要措施。不少商店还组织职工讨论，使大家认识保持经营特色的重要意义。
    商业部门在调拨原料材料时，注意支持某些传统商品的生产；基层企业的职工也千方百计开辟原料材料来源，同时改进技术，用粗料制出精品。著名的大香宾鞋店、新新鞋店、老妙香室，已分别恢复生产老年妇女穿的小脚绣花鞋、戏剧演员用的画眉笔等产品，满足这些顾客的特殊需要。蓝棠皮鞋店今年以来用废旧轮胎作底制皮鞋，职工们采用蒸气热压等办法使轮胎底平整，现在已经设计出两百多种轮胎底的新产品。
    许多商店在恢复自设工场或改进加工方法以后，经营特色得到了发扬。亨生、人立、蓝苓等服装店已恢复原有的工场，缝制高级服装由一个裁缝师一手负责到底，发扬了精工细作的特色。有些著名商店曾经中断的产销关系，现在也已逐渐恢复起来。
    上海的许多店摊，在服务方式上也继续保持和发扬了原有的优良传统。如有些洗染店为顾客烫衣，如果顾客需要很急，当天就可以烫出来。有的皮鞋摊和家具修配站一方面设立固定的服务点，一方面派人串街走巷，流动服务。
    上海商业部门已加强了某些特殊技艺的传授工作，培养接班人。饮食服务行业成立了技术进修班，选拔一批青年职工参加学习，由技艺高超的理发师、厨师担任教员。学员们除了集中听课以外，还分别跟班学习。现在，有些学徒已能根据顾客的脸型、肤色和年龄等设计发型，有的已能初步掌握老师傅的烹调技术，烧出名菜名点。（图片）
