Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: The outdoor temperature in Shanghai has risen above 30 degrees Celsius for several consecutive days. The heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment in various factories has also begun to play its role.

    Walking into the No. 1 Workshop of the Xinhu Iron and Steel Plant, one is immediately greeted by a mist. Dozens of vents and four large sprinkler heads continuously spray cooling water mist. Heat insulation boards are installed next to the steel heating furnaces, and heat insulation mobile water tanks hang at the furnace openings. Transparent heat-insulating water curtains are installed on both sides of the rolling path where the red-hot steel billets pass. In addition, the factory has set up cool and pleasant air-conditioned rooms for workers to rest and provides a large amount of salt soda and ice banana juice for workers to drink.

    Among the employees of the Shanghai steel industry, new workers account for a considerable proportion, and most of them have not experienced the trials of summer high-temperature operations. To ensure that this newly grown workforce can produce normally and safely during the hot season, the relevant leadership departments in Shanghai arranged for heatstroke prevention and cooling work as early as the first quarter of this year. At present, the responsible cadres of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and leading cadres of various factories are going deep into various high-temperature workshops and high-temperature work sections to work alongside the workers and study further strengthening heatstroke prevention and cooling work and improving the workers' working conditions.

    To protect workers working in the open air from the scorching sun, various factories have specially adjusted their working hours and built sunshades. In addition to ventilation and cooling in the workshops, some factories also use a blue cloud cyan powder to coat the glass skylights to resist solar radiation heat, which not only reduces the temperature in the workshops but also makes the light in the workshops softer.

    Ensuring that employees get enough sleep and rest is also an important part of the heatstroke prevention and cooling work of various factories and related departments this year. The municipal leadership department allocated 160,000 square meters of housing to factories as worker dormitories; various districts also allocated a batch of housing as temporary dormitories for workers. Some workers whose homes are far from the factory have moved into new residences near the factory. Recently, small red flags have been placed next to the doors of many night shift workers' residences in Putuo District. These flags remind neighbors and street vendors not to make loud noises; in Yangpu District, where workers are concentrated, children are also organized to carry out beneficial summer activities to prevent them from making noise and disturbing night shift workers' rest.

### 高气温下保高产  上海各厂防暑设备发挥作用

    高气温下保高产
    上海各厂防暑设备发挥作用
    据新华社上海电　上海市室外气温连日来已上升到摄氏三十度以上，各工厂的防暑降温装置也开始发挥作用。
    走进新沪钢铁厂第一车间，只见雾气扑面而来，几十个风口和四只大型莲蓬头不停地喷射出清凉的水雾。烘钢炉旁都安装了隔热板，炉口挂着隔热活动水箱。在火红的钢坯经过的滚道两侧，都装上了透明的隔热水帘。此外，工厂还设置了凉爽宜人的冷气室给工人休息，准备了大量的盐汽水、冰香蕉汁供工人饮用。
    上海钢铁工业职工中，新工人占着相当大的比例，他们大都没有经过炎夏高温作业的锻炼。为了使这支新成长的队伍在高温季节能够正常地安全地生产，上海市有关领导部门早在今年第一季度就安排了防暑降温工作。目前，中共上海市委负责干部和各厂领导干部，都深入各个高温车间和高温工段，跟工人们一同劳动、一同研究进一步加强防暑降温工作，改善工人的劳动条件。
    为了使露天作业的工人免受烈日曝晒，各厂特别调整了他们的劳动时间，搭盖了凉棚。车间内除了通风降温以外，有的工厂还用一种蓝色的云青粉末涂在玻璃天窗上，抵挡太阳的辐射热，不但可以降低车间温度，而且使车间里的光线变得更柔和。
    叫职工睡足歇好，也是今年各厂和有关部门防暑降温工作的一个重要内容。市领导部门调拨了十六万平方米的房屋给工厂作工人宿舍；各区也拨出一批房屋作为工人的临时宿舍。有些住家离工厂较远的工人已经迁入近厂的新居。最近，普陀区许多夜班工人住宅的门旁都插上了小红旗，它提醒左邻右舍和过路小贩不要大声喧嚷；工人聚居的杨浦区，儿童也被组织起来开展一些有益的夏令活动，以免他们吵闹妨害夜班工人休息。
