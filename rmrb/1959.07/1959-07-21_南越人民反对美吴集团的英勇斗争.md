The Ngo Dinh Diem reactionary regime has declared South Vietnam to be in a "state of war" five years after the signing of the Geneva Accords. Tens of thousands of South Vietnamese people are suffering arrest, execution, and poisoning as if in wartime... and are being bombed by aircraft and artillery. The U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique is using all means of terror and suppression to force the South Vietnamese people to submit to their tyrannical rule, turning South Vietnam into a U.S. imperialist military base and colony, and thoroughly realizing the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to prepare for war and expand aggression in Indochina. However, all these atrocities and killings have ignited the anger of the vast Vietnamese people from south to north. They are indignantly launching a heroic struggle against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

Ngo Dinh Diem, who was brought to power by U.S. imperialism on July 7, 1954, declared "anti-communism" as a "national policy" from the beginning, writing this "national policy" explicitly into the "constitution" of South Vietnam. In the southern provinces, he continuously launched large-scale so-called "control communism and eliminate communism" campaigns. In essence, this "anti-communist national policy" lies in undermining the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and suppressing and persecuting South Vietnamese patriots, former resistance personnel, and supporters of the Geneva Accords. Thus, under the planning and direction of U.S. imperialism, the South Vietnamese authorities organized, equipped, and trained 150,000 regular troops; raised a large number of security forces, civil guards, military police, police, secret agents, informants, and local henchmen; established prisons and concentration camps everywhere; burned down large areas of civilian houses; and forced the people to concentrate in remote mountainous areas to carry out the construction of "reclamation areas" serving military purposes. At the same time, they launched more than 20 large-scale "campaigns" and countless military "sweeps" one after another. In the first three months of 1959 alone, there were more than 100 large and small "sweeps." The U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique has turned South Vietnam into a hell on earth.

In the past six months or so, the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique has increasingly intensified its extreme fascist path. Following the major tragedy at the Phu Loi concentration camp in December 1958, starting in late February of this year, under the direct command of South Vietnamese General Duong Van Minh and American military advisors, an unprecedented large-scale military "sweep" was launched against the D war zone and its adjacent areas east of Highway 13 in Bien Hoa Province, where the Vietnamese People's Army fought during the resistance war. South Vietnam successively dispatched about 15,000 regular troops, including infantry, engineers, paratroopers, and artillery, and thousands of public security soldiers, civil guards, secret agents, commandos, and the so-called most vicious "flower-clad army" in Indochina. They raped women, looted property, burned grain, destroyed crops, and massacred unarmed innocent civilians. What is even worse, they dispatched aircraft to carry out indiscriminate bombing in the Da Lat area three times, causing great losses to the people.

While carrying out large-scale military suppression, Ngo Dinh Diem also promulgated Decree No. 10 of 1959 on May 6 this year, establishing "special military tribunals" in Saigon, Hue, and Ban Me Thuot, and conducting mobile trials outside the tribunals in order to punish "those who have committed or plan to commit crimes" with the death penalty or life imprisonment; thereby establishing a system of extremely cruel retaliation and suppression against former resistance personnel and South Vietnamese patriots.

According to incomplete statistics, from the restoration of peace to February 1959, 180,843 people have been arrested and imprisoned, 10,185 people have been injured or disabled, and 4,971 people have died or disappeared.

The above-mentioned cruel suppression methods, coupled with the South Vietnamese authorities' exorbitant taxes, forced labor, heavy corvée, and forced relocation, have plunged the South Vietnamese people into a miserable situation of deep water and scorching fire, creating a social scene of widespread popular discontent and uprisings in South Vietnam.

However, the Vietnamese people, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition and have been tempered in the flames of the eight-year resistance war, have waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique for undermining the reunification of the motherland, turning South Vietnam into a colony and military base, and brutally suppressing and persecuting their compatriots.

The South Vietnamese people, who live directly under the claws of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique and suffer from its harm, are pushing the anti-U.S. and anti-Ngo Dinh Diem struggle to a new climax in the face of this violence and bloodshed.

After the truth of the Phu Loi massacre was revealed, angry voices resounded everywhere in the South, from cities to rural areas, from mountains to plains. Many places held strikes and market strikes to express collective condolences; slogans against the Phu Loi massacre spread throughout more than ten provinces and cities, with slogans such as "The criminal activities of the executioners must be stopped" and "The barbaric slaughterhouse—the concentration camp—must be disbanded"; mass rallies were held in many places to mourn the victims; in some villages, the vast majority of residents wore black gauze for the deceased; groups of elders, women, and children, dressed in mourning clothes or wearing white headbands, went to the South Vietnamese government agencies to cry for their husbands and demand the bodies of their relatives, demanding that Ngo Dinh Diem return the bodies of their loved ones; many people flocked to Phu Loi, and some marched on the spot; countless protest letters flew like snowflakes to various South Vietnamese government agencies; temples, holy rooms, and churches rang bells and drums to perform supererogatory services and pray for the dead; some places beat gongs and drums all night long to express their resentment towards the murderers. On April 20 this year, more than 100 people came from various places to petition in front of the South Vietnamese "National Assembly" in Saigon, leading to a mass demonstration of thousands of people. The above-mentioned various forms of struggle have put the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in an extremely embarrassing and passive situation.

At the same time, the South Vietnamese people's struggle against the construction of "reclamation areas" is also developing. Thua Thien, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh provinces and the southern part of Quang Tri province are the key provinces where the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem forces people to relocate to "reclamation areas," but it is in these places that people put forward the slogan "Do not go to the Central Highlands to build military bases for the American devils." They resist the "study" organized by the South Vietnamese authorities. Parents and wives intercept the cars of the South Vietnamese reactionary regime transporting their relatives to become "laborers." At rallies, elders in many places stood up to criticize the South Vietnamese authorities' policy of forcing the people to do hard labor, demanding a peaceful and prosperous life and family reunion. The South Vietnamese "Republic Army Radio Station" had to admit: "The people who were forcibly taken away ran away or asked to go home as soon as they set foot on the land of the Central Highlands." Therefore, the South Vietnamese "reclamation areas" have not been "stabilized" for a long time, making it impossible for the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's plan to build a strategically important military base in the Central Highlands to be realized as scheduled.

In order to protect their lives and property and defend the safety of their homes, the people in many areas of South Vietnam have had to take up knives, spears, bows and arrows to carry out self-defense struggles, and give due punishment to the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's lackeys such as the unscrupulous local tyrants and bullies, pseudo-township chiefs, and public security army police chiefs. According to a Saigon dispatch from United Press International on April 12, 1959: "In the first three months of this year, more than 200 village and district officials were killed in South Vietnam." The South Vietnamese official mouthpiece, "National Revolution Daily," exclaimed: "Defending the countryside—the survival of the republican system." Many South Vietnamese newspapers revealed that the countryside is currently the "most unstable" place in South Vietnam, so that the personnel of the reactionary regime are panic-stricken and have asked Ngo Dinh Diem to stabilize the "order" in the countryside.

In addition, the struggle of people from all walks of life against "U.S. aid," against the South Vietnamese reactionary regime's economic policy of dependence on U.S. imperialism, demanding improved living standards, and guaranteeing economic interests is also developing vigorously. This year, on May Day International Labor Day, more than 200,000 working people in Saigon broke through the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's heavy obstacles and held rallies and demonstrations. People shouted slogans against layoffs, solving unemployment, increasing wages, issuing living allowances, and demanding democratic freedoms. 200,000 vendors in 50 markets in Saigon and its suburbs held two congresses to condemn U.S. imperialism for using "U.S. aid" to carry out economic aggression, and demanded tax cuts and the abolition of various unreasonable fine systems. Workers in industries such as textiles and pottery, farmers who plant cotton, sugarcane, and raise silkworms, and even capitalists who operate textile and sugar industries are dissatisfied with "U.S. aid" destroying the South Vietnamese economy and affecting their personal interests, and have demanded the protection of domestic goods and the restriction or prohibition of imports of non-essential goods. Some intellectuals have also written articles in newspapers criticizing "U.S. aid," saying: "U.S. aid only creates false prosperity and has no impact on improving people's livelihoods," they demand "guaranteeing autonomy and independence."

Anti-American and anti-Ngo Dinh Diem sentiments are also growing in the South Vietnamese army. The sentiment of "The French are gone, the Americans are here" is spreading among the South Vietnamese soldiers. The arrogant and rude attitude of the American military advisors, as well as incidents such as beating South Vietnamese officers and soldiers, have aroused more and more resentment among the South Vietnamese soldiers. In early 1958, more than 3,000 soldiers in the Wu Xing barracks collectively went on a hunger strike. In May 1958, a plane escorting Ngo Dinh Diem escaped midway. On February 4, 1959, 12,000 new recruits at the Guangzhong Training Center "did not eat, did not study, and did not practice," demanding to go home. According to a broadcast by the British London Radio: "On the evening of July 8, 1959, in a camp of the Ngo Dinh Diem army in Bien Hoa, two American advisors were killed and another was injured." The above-mentioned typical examples fully reflect that even in the army under the strict control of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, centrifugal tendencies and the anti-American and anti-Ngo Dinh Diem struggle are constantly developing.

On the eve of the upcoming re-election of the South Vietnamese "National Assembly" in August this year, people from all walks of life in South Vietnam have been talking a lot, and have exposed the unreasonable and ambiguous provisions in Ngo Dinh Diem's election regulations. Recently, thirteen prominent political figures in South Vietnam issued a statement accusing Ngo Dinh Diem of why he did not mention the representatives of ethnic minorities in the mountainous areas in this "National Assembly" re-election? Why were the representatives of the Southward Migration People not mentioned in the next "National Assembly"? Why is the campaign period only fourteen days? The statement finally demanded that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime must promulgate laws on freedom of the press, publication, and assembly as soon as possible, and guarantee that voters will not be monitored by military police and public security personnel throughout the election process, and that candidates must supervise the ballot counting. In addition, some South Vietnamese newspapers exposed the "dirty" methods of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in the previous "National Assembly" elections.

The people of the North, who are carrying out socialist construction and living an increasingly better life, are carrying out the struggle against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique together with the people of the South, striving to realize the reunification of the motherland. Premier Pham Van Dong's letter to the South Vietnamese authorities on December 22, 1958, embodies the urgent desire of all the Vietnamese people from north to south for the reunification of the motherland. Premier Pham Van Dong's peace initiative has aroused enthusiastic responses and support among people from all walks of life in South Vietnam. Recently, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, sent a telegram and submitted a memorandum to the Vietnamese International Supervisory and Supervisory Committee, severely condemning the crimes of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities in seriously violating the Geneva Accords. At the end of last year, after the atrocities of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in torturing and mutilating Chen Thi Li, a former resistance fighter, as revenge, the people of the North strongly condemned the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique for this. The struggle against the Phu Loi massacre has been launched like a raging fire in the North. In the first ten days of the campaign alone, more than 2 million people took to the streets to demonstrate. To date, there have been more than 15,000 demonstrations of various sizes. 4.5 million people have signed their names against the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique and in support of Premier Pham Van Dong's peace initiative. As of February 23 this year, the people of North Vietnam have supported the families of the deceased and survivors of the Phu Loi concentration camp with 15 million Vietnamese dong in cash and 10 tons of medicines. People organize "Phu Loi Struggle Day" and "Phu Loi Struggle Time", turning grief and anger into strength, and supporting the struggle of the South Vietnamese people with practical actions of active labor, work and study. In addition, the 10th session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, held on May 20, 1959, made a statement on the situation in the South. On May 25, 1959, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a call to continue the struggle against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's intensified persecution and suppression of the people in the South. The people of the North and the South are more closely united in the struggle, and no reactionary force can thwart the fighting will of the South Vietnamese people. Although the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique is currently in control of a whole set of state machinery, it will do everything possible to strengthen its reactionary rule and frantically suppress the people; however, all terroristic suppression and bloody massacres can only play the role of negative teachers. The South Vietnamese people have increasingly recognized that U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are their mortal enemies and are strengthening their struggle. Victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people, and a peaceful, unified, democratic, and independent Vietnam will surely be realized.

    南越人民反对美吴集团的英勇斗争
    政新
    在日内瓦协议签订五年后的今天，吴庭艳反动政权却宣布南越处于“战争状态”，成千累万的南越人民像战时一样惨遭逮捕、枪杀、毒害……横遭飞机、大炮的轰击。美吴集团就这样地用尽一切恐怖镇压的手段，企图使南越人民屈服在它们的暴虐统治之下，把南越变成美帝国主义的军事基地和殖民地，彻底实现美帝国主义的准备战争、在印度支那扩大侵略的阴谋。但是，所有这一切的暴行和杀戮却燃烧起从南到北的广大越南人民的满腔怒火。他们义愤填膺地向美吴集团展开了英勇斗争。
    由美帝国主义于1954年7月7日扶持上台的吴庭艳，一开始就宣布以“反共”为“国策”，将这一“国策”明文写在南越的“宪法”上，并在南方各省连续不断地展开大规模的所谓“控共、灭共”运动。其实，这种“反共国策”的实质就在于破坏越南的和平统一，镇压和迫害南越爱国者、前抗战人员和拥护日内瓦协议的人。于是，在美帝国主义的策划和指使下，南越当局组织、装备和训练十五万正规军；豢养一大批保安兵、民卫队、宪兵、警察、特务、暗探和地方爪牙；在各地遍设监狱和集中营；并烧毁大片民房，驱使老百姓集中于荒山僻野的地区，进行服务于军事目的的“垦荒区”的建设。同时接二连三地发动二十余次规模浩大的“战役”和无数次的军事“扫荡”，仅1959年头三个月内，大小“扫荡”即达一百余次之多。美吴集团把南越变成了一所惨无人道的人间地狱。
    最近半年多来，美吴集团日益变本加厉地走上极端法西斯的道路。继1958年12月富利集中营大惨案后，接着今年2月下旬以来，在南越军队杨文明中将和美国军事顾问的直接指挥下，又对边和省十三号公路以东越南人民军抗战时期的D战区及其邻近地区，发动了一次空前大规模的军事“扫荡”。南越先后出动了约一万五千名步兵、工兵、伞兵、炮兵等正规部队和上千名公安兵、民卫队、密探、别动队，以及号称为印度支那最凶恶的“花衣军”。他们强奸妇女，抢劫民财，烧毁粮食，破坏庄稼，残杀手无寸铁的无辜平民。更甚者，他们出动飞机在达莱地区三次狂轰滥炸，使人民遭到极大的损失。
    在大规模军事镇压的同时，吴庭艳又于今年5月6日颁布了1959年第10号法令，在西贡、顺化、邦美蜀设立“特别军事法庭”，并在庭外流动审判，以便用死刑或无期徒刑来惩办
  “已犯或图谋犯法”者；从而建立起一种对前抗战人员和南越爱国者进行无比残酷的报复和镇压的制度。
    据不完全的统计，自从和平恢复到1959年2月止，已有十八万零八百四十三人被拘捕监禁，一万零一百八十五人被打伤或残废，四千九百七十一人死亡或失踪。
    上述这种残酷的镇压手段，加上南越当局的苛捐杂税、抓伕拉丁、沉重的苦役和强迫迁居等等，使南越人民陷于水深火热的悲惨境地，造成了一幅南越民不聊生，民变蜂起的社会景象。
    但是，具有光荣革命传统，在八年抗战的烽火中经受过锻炼的越南人民，为坚决反对美吴集团破坏祖国统一、沦南越为殖民地及军事基地，穷凶极恶地镇压和迫害自己的同胞而进行了英勇顽强的斗争。
    直接生活在美吴集团的魔爪之下身受其害的南越人民，就在这种暴力和屠刀面前，把反美反吴的斗争推向新的高潮。
    富利惨案的真相大白之后，在南方，从城市到农村，从山区到平原，处处都响彻了愤怒的声音。许多地方罢工、罢市表示集体吊唁；反对富利惨案的标语、口号传遍十余省市，上面写着：“必须制止刽子手的罪恶活动”、
  “必须解散野蛮的屠场——集中营”；许多地方的群众集会为死难者致哀；有的村庄绝大部分的居民为死者佩带黑纱；三五成群的父老妇孺身穿孝服或头缠白巾到南越政权机关哭夫索子，要求吴庭艳还给亲人的尸体；不少老百姓拥向富利，有的就在现地游行；无数封抗议书像雪片似的飞向南越各个政权机关；寺院、圣室、教堂钟鼓齐鸣，为死者超度、祈祷；有的地方敲锣击鼓，彻夜不息，表示对杀人犯的愤恨。今年4月20日，一百多群众从各个地方来到西贡市南越“国会”门前请愿，酿成上千人的群众示威。上述的各种形形色色的斗争，使美吴集团陷入极为狼狈和被动的境地。
    与此同时，南越人民反对建设“垦荒区”的斗争也在发展着。承天、广南、广义、平定等省及广治省南部是美吴抓伕迁居“垦荒区”的重点省份，但是就在这些地方人民提出“不去西原为美国佬建设军事基地”的口号。他们抵制南越当局组织的“学习”。父母妻子截住南越反动政权运送自己的亲人去当“民伕”的汽车。在集会上，不少地方父老长者站出来指责南越当局强迫老百姓当苦力的政策，要求安居乐业家庭团聚。南越“共和国军队广播电台”也不得不承认：“被强迫拉走的老百姓，刚刚踏上西原的土地，就逃跑或要求回家”。因此，南越的“垦荒区”长期不得“稳定”，使美吴集团建设具有战略意义的西原军事基地的计划，不能如期实现。
    南越不少地区的老百姓为保护自己的生命财产，保卫家乡安全，不得不拿起刀枪、梭镖、弓箭进行自卫斗争，并对那些无恶不作的土豪恶霸、伪乡区长、公安军警察头子等美吴集团的鹰犬给予应有的惩办。据合众国际社1959年4月12日西贡消息：“今年头三个月内，南越有二百多名村和区的官员被杀。”南越官方喉舌“国家革命报”惊呼：“保卫农村——共和制度的存亡问题”。南越许多报刊透露出农村是南越目前“最不稳定”的地方，以致反动政权的人员惶惶不安，纷纷要求吴庭艳稳定农村“秩序”。
    此外，各个阶层人民的反对“美援”，反对南越反动政权依附于美帝国主义的经济政策，要求改善生活，保障经济利益的斗争，也在蓬勃地发展着。今年“五一”国际劳动节，西贡市二十多万劳动人民冲破了美吴集团的重重阻挠，举行了集会和示威游行。人们呼喊着反对裁减人员、解决失业、增加工资、发给生活补贴、要求民主自由权利等口号。西贡市以及郊区五十个市场的二十万商贩曾经举行了两次大会，谴责美帝国主义利用“美援”来进行经济侵略，并要求减税和废除各种无理的罚款制度。纺织、陶器等行业中的工人，植棉、种甘蔗和养蚕的农民，以至经营纺织、制糖业的资本家，都不满“美援”破坏南越经济和影响切身利益，纷纷要求保卫国货、限制或禁止非必需品进口。某些知识界人士也在报纸上撰文抨击“美援”说：“美援只造成虚假繁荣，对改善民生无影响”，他们要求“保证自主和独立”。
    南越军队中的反美反吴情绪也在日益增长。“法国人走，美国人来”的舆论正在南越士兵中蔓延着。美国军事顾问的蛮横傲慢的态度，以及殴打南越官兵等事件的发生，已经激起了南越军人的愈来愈多的忿懑。1958年初在武性兵营的三千多名士兵曾集体绝食。1958年5月间，一架护送吴庭艳的飞机中途逃逸。1959年2月4日光中训练中心一万二千名新兵
  “不吃、不学、不练习”，要求回家。据英国伦敦电台广播：“1959年7月8日晚上在边和吴庭艳军队的一个军营中，两名美国顾问被杀死，另一名受伤。”上述这些典型事例都充分反映出即便在美吴集团控制严密的军队中，离心倾向和反美反吴的斗争也是在不断发展着的。
    在南越“国会”于今年8月即将改选的前夕，南越各阶层人民议论纷纷，并且揭露了吴庭艳在选举条例中的无理和含糊的规定。最近南越十三名著名政界人士曾经发表了一项声明，指责吴庭艳在这次“国会”改选中为什么没有提到山区少数民族的代表？为什么在下届
  “国会”中没有提到南迁人民的代表？竞选期限为什么只有十四天？声明最后要求吴庭艳政权必须尽早颁行新闻、出版、集会自由的法令，要保障在整个选举过程中投票者不受军警、公安人员的监视，在审票时必须有竞选者的监督。此外，南越某些报刊揭露了美吴集团在前一届“国会”选举中的“肮脏”手段。
    正在进行社会主义建设、生活日益美好的北方人民与南方人民一起进行反对美吴集团的斗争，争取实现祖国的统一。1958年12月22日范文同总理给南越当局的公函体现了从北至南全体越南人民对统一祖国的迫切愿望。范文同总理的和平倡议在南越各阶层人民中引起热烈的反应和拥护。最近以来，越南人民军总司令武元甲大将致越南国际监察和监督委员会电文和提出备忘录，严厉谴责美国和南越当局严重违反日内瓦协议罪行。去年年底，美吴集团为报复前抗战人员陈氏里，对她酷刑拷打以至形成残疾的暴行被揭露后，北方人民对此向美吴集团进行了强烈谴责。反对富利惨案的斗争在北方已经如火如荼地开展起来，仅仅在运动开始的头十天内，就有二百多万人上街游行示威。迄今大小规模的游行示威已达一万五千余次。有四百五十万人签名反对美吴集团的罪行和拥护范文同总理的和平倡议。至今年2月23日北越人民共支援富利集中营的死者家属和余生者现款一千五百万元（越币）和十吨药品。人们组织“富利斗争日”、“富利斗争时”，化悲愤为力量，以积极劳动、工作和学习的实际行动支援南越人民的斗争。此外，1959年5月20日召开的越南民主共和国国会第十次会议作出了关于南方形势的声明。1959年5月25日越南祖国战线中央委员会发表了继续反对美吴集团加紧迫害和镇压南方人民而斗争的号召书。南北方人民在斗争中团结得更紧密，任何反动势力都不能挫败南越人民的斗争意志。目前美吴集团虽然掌握着一整套国家机器，并将竭尽全力加强其反动统治，疯狂地镇压人民；然而一切的恐怖镇压和血腥屠杀只能起到反面教员的作用。南越人民愈加认清美帝国主义和它的走狗是自己的死敌而加强斗争。胜利一定属于越南人民，和平、统一、民主、独立的越南必将实现。
