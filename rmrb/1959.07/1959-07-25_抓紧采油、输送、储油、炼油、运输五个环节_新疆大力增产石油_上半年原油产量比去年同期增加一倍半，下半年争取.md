Grasp the Five Key Links of Oil Extraction, Transportation, Storage, Refining, and Transport
Xinjiang Vigorously Increases Oil Production
Crude Oil Production in the First Half of the Year Increased by One and a Half Times Compared with the Same Period Last Year; Strive for Further Increases in the Second Half of the Year

Urumqi, July 24 (this newspaper) – The petroleum industry in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has entered a new stage – shifting from a focus on exploration to a comprehensive great leap forward centered on oil extraction. Crude oil production in the first half of this year was equivalent to 266.4% of the same period last year, almost the same as the total production for the entire last year. Currently, all petroleum workers are engaged in an oil-winning battle, striving to increase oil extraction by more than 50% in the second half of the year compared to the first half.

In the past few years, Xinjiang's petroleum industry departments concentrated their efforts on large-scale geological exploration work in the Tianshan Mountains, discovering and confirming the Kelamayi oil field, and exploring several high-yield areas, laying the foundation for large-scale, planned oil extraction.

Based on the new situation and new tasks this year, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has determined that the new work policy is to shorten the front, concentrate forces, ensure key points, and promote a great leap forward in all work centered on oil extraction. In order to concentrate the main leadership, technical forces, and equipment on oil extraction, the bureau decided to withdraw three thousand petroleum workers and technical cadres from Tarim to support the Kelamayi oil field, and a large number of vehicles, drilling rigs, and equipment were also transferred to the Kelamayi and Dushanzi areas.

In the current oil-winning battle aimed at high-quality, high-yield, and safe production, the Secretary of the Party Committee and the Director of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration have gone to the oil fields to strengthen leadership of oil extraction work, and are grasping the five major links of oil extraction, refining, transportation, storage, and transport, linking one to another, to ensure the comprehensive completion of the state plan for crude oil production and refined products. In terms of oil extraction, a large number of drilling teams have been concentrated in high-yield areas to drill a batch of new production wells. At the same time, the management of existing oil wells has been strengthened, new technologies such as water injection oil recovery have been adopted to increase oil production, and vigorous efforts have been made to repair shut-down old wells. In order to transport the extracted crude oil to the refinery in a timely manner, the Kelamayi-Dushanzi refinery oil pipeline is being laid with a secondary line, and measures are being taken to increase oil transmission capacity. In order to ensure uninterrupted oil well production and oil transportation, a batch of 5,000 to 10,000 cubic meter metal and non-metal oil storage tanks are being built at oil fields and pump stations along the oil pipeline. The second phase of the expansion project of the Dushanzi refinery is in full swing, and the cracking workshop, one of the key projects, will be completed in August. A new refinery in Kelamayi will soon be put into production. More than a thousand oil transport vehicles recently allocated by the state have successively joined the work of transporting oil eastward.

### 抓紧采油、输送、储油、炼油、运输五个环节  新疆大力增产石油  上半年原油产量比去年同期增加一倍半，下半年争取

    抓紧采油、输送、储油、炼油、运输五个环节
    新疆大力增产石油
    上半年原油产量比去年同期增加一倍半，下半年争取再增产50％以上
    本报乌鲁木齐24日电　新疆维吾尔自治区的石油工业已经跨进一个新阶段——从过去的以勘探为重点转入以采油为中心的全面大跃进。今年上半年生产的原油，等于去年同期的266.4％，和去年全年的产量差不多。目前，全体石油职工正在展开夺油大战，力争在下半年完成的采油量比上半年再增加50％以上。
    过去几年，新疆石油工业部门集中力量在天山南北进行了大规模的地质勘探工作，找到并证实了克拉玛依大油区，探出了几处高产区，为大规模有计划地开采石油打下了基础。
    根据今年的新情况、新任务，中共新疆石油管理局委员会确定新的工作方针是：缩短战线，集中兵力，确保重点，以采油为中心带动一切工作大跃进。为了把主要的领导力量、技术力量和设备集中到采油方面，这个局决定从塔里木抽出三千名石油工人和技术干部支援克拉玛依油区，大批的车辆、钻机和器材设备等也调到克拉玛依、独山子一带。
    在目前以优质、高产、安全生产为目标的夺油大战中，新疆石油管理局的党委书记、局长都到油田加强采油工作的领导，并且抓紧采油、炼油、输送、储油、运输五大环节，一环扣一环，保证全面完成原油生产和炼制成品的国家计划。在采油方面，已经集中大批钻井队在高产地区开钻一批新的生产井，同时对现有油井加强管理，采用注水采油的新技术提高产油量，并且大力修复停产的旧井。为了及时把开采出的原油输送到炼油厂，克拉玛依—独山子炼油厂的输油管正在铺设副线，并采取提高输油能力的措施。为了保证油井生产和输油不间断，油田上和输油管沿线各个泵站正在建设一批五千到一万立方米的金属和非金属储油罐。独山子炼油厂第二期扩建工程正在紧张进行，重点工程之一的裂化车间在8月间就可以完工。克拉玛依新建的一座炼油厂，最近即将投入生产。国家最近调拨的一千多辆运油汽车，已陆续参加石油东运工作。
