In the National Goods Store
By our reporters Ye Zijian and Ma Lie

	One Sunday evening, Kunming had a light rain. After the rain, the air on the streets was fresh and pleasant. A group of minority farmers from the border areas came to the Kunming National Goods Store.

	The display cabinets were filled with more than a thousand kinds of special goods favored by minority nationalities. In a row of glass cabinets, there were more than twenty kinds of colorful cloths with strong ethnic characteristics. One of the cloths had patterns printed in eleven colors that looked like three-dimensional flowers hand-embroidered. In another row of display cases across the aisle, various ethnic costumes were hung, the most eye-catching being the pleated skirts favored by Miao girls and the dark cyan long gowns adorned with silver ornaments that the Lahu women regarded as formal wear. In the counter on the right, colorful beaded necklaces were sparkling; the red apricot, snow-white, and emerald green luster from coral, agate, crystal, and glass beads shone together.

	Kangna, a Nu girl from the Bilo Snow Mountain, and Ma Laoer, a Kutsong man who had just walked out of the primeval forest of the Ailao Mountain, admired these goods with excitement. Kangna looked at the dazzling array of beaded necklaces and couldn't decide which one to buy. In the end, she bought three strings of yellow dotted beaded necklaces and one string of white beaded necklaces to hang around her neck, her face flushed with excitement. Pu Man'si, a Lisu hunter from the Nu Mountains, took a waist knife more than two feet long from the salesperson, drew it out of its sheath with a "whoosh," held it as high as his eyes, and squinted at the blade. A streak of blue light shimmered under the light. He exclaimed, "Good! I'll buy it!"

	"Our national goods store has been running for more than three years. Never has there been more goods or more customers than this year. Now, it's lively every day," Zheng Shunxi, the person in charge of the Kunming National Goods Store, told us. "Last year, our store only had one shop. Now we have three. Last year, the shop only had more than eight hundred kinds of special goods needed by minority nationalities. Now, the goods in these cabinets amount to more than one thousand eight hundred kinds, including one thousand two hundred kinds of special goods originally favored by minority nationalities, and another six hundred kinds prepared for minority peoples who have broken down old customs and bad habits in the Great Leap Forward. In the past, Dai girls in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture only wore skirts and not trousers. After learning to plow the fields last year, they only wear trousers and not skirts when working. Many Dai girls who come to Kunming to visit often come here to buy cloth to make trousers."

	As we spoke, we came to some counters filled with fabrics and silks. Zheng Shunxi said, "Dai girls often buy this kind of Han Chinese fabric and silk to make trousers. Before September last year, we didn't see the new situation that emerged after the minority nationalities broke down old customs and bad habits in the Great Leap Forward, and we didn't prepare these things, so the sales volume was always low, averaging only more than 500 yuan a day. Now, with the increase in special goods and the strengthening of the supply of general goods, the average daily sales volume has increased more than five times compared with the same period last year, and the sales plan for the first half of this year was completed by the end of May."

	In the processing factory of the national goods store, dozens of Han Chinese workers were concentrating on processing the lace and beads that fraternal nationalities liked most. According to the interests and living habits of the various nationalities, they wove various beautiful patterns. On a lace that was only a little more than an inch wide, they wove complex scenes of dragons and phoenixes dancing and magpies frolicking on plum blossoms, symbolizing auspiciousness and good luck. In the past, beads were always transported from Zibo County, Shandong Province. Last year, Zibo County sent several veteran workers to Kunming to help set up a bead processing factory. When we came here to visit, three furnaces were burning with raging blue flames. The female workers held plastic that looked like malt candy by the furnaces, and with the nimble techniques of magicians, they made small round beads one by one. These beads of various colors, such as purplish red, apricot yellow, sky blue, pink, milky white, emerald green, and jade, could be made into necklaces, or used to be inlaid on the edges and cuffs of clothes, which could make the minority girls look even more beautiful.

	When we finally returned to the national goods store, it was already late at night. Under the lamplight, there were still many minority farmers excitedly choosing their favorite things. (Attached photos)

    在民族商品店里
    本报记者　叶子健　马烈
    星期天傍晚，昆明下了一阵小雨，雨后街道上空气清新宜人。一群来自边疆的少数民族农民来到了昆明民族商品门市部。
    橱柜里陈列着一千多种少数民族喜爱的特殊商品。在一溜玻璃柜里，摆着二十多种富有浓厚民族色彩的花布。其中有一种布，用十一种颜色染印的花纹像手工挑的立体花朵一样。当面的另一排货橱里，挂满了各种各样的民族服装，其中最引人注目的是苗族少女喜爱的百折裙，拉祜族妇女视为礼服的坠满了银饰的重青色长衫。在右手边的柜台里，五光十色的圆珠项链在闪光；珊瑚、玛瑙、水晶、琉璃珠子发出的红杏色、雪白、碧绿的光彩交相辉映。
    从碧罗雪山上来的怒族姑娘康纳和刚走出哀牢山原始森林的苦聪人马老二，带着激动的神情在欣赏这些商品。康纳看着琳琅满目的一串串圆珠项链，一时不能决定买哪串好。最后她选购了三串黄色的点花圆珠项链和一串白色的圆珠项链挂在脖子上，面上泛起一阵兴奋的红晕。怒山上的傈僳族猎手普满四从售货员的手里接过一把二尺多长的腰刀，把它刷地一声抽出鞘来，举得和眼睛一般平，用一只眼瞄那刀锋，灯光下一脉蓝色的光彩在闪烁。他喝起采来：“好呀！我买呐！”
    “我们这个民族商店，已经办了三年多了。哪一年也没有今年的货多，顾客多。现在，天天都是热热闹闹的。”昆明民族商店的负责人郑顺喜告诉我们说，“去年我们这个店里只有一个门市部，现在有了三个。去年门市部里还只有八百多种少数民族需要的特殊商品，现在装在这些柜柜里的商品有一千八百多种，其中有一千二百多种少数民族原来就喜爱的特殊商品，另外六百多种是为那些在大跃进中打破了陈规陋习的少数民族人民准备的。西双版纳傣族自治州的傣族少女过去只穿裙子不穿裤子，去年学会犁田以后，她们在劳动时就只穿裤子不穿裙子了。许多到昆明来参观的傣族少女常在我们这里来买做裤子的布。”
    说话间，我们来到了一些装着布匹和绸子的柜台前。郑顺喜说：“这种汉族用的布料和绸料，傣族少女就常买去做裤子。去年9月以前，我们没有看到大跃进中少数民族打破陈规陋习后出现的新形势，没有准备这些东西，所以销售额总是提不高，平均每天只卖得五百多元钱；现在增加了特殊商品，又加强了一般商品的供应，平均每天的销售额比去年同期增加五倍以上，今年上半年的销售计划在5月底就完成了。”
    在民族商品店的加工厂里，几十个汉族工人正在聚精会神地为兄弟民族加工他们最喜欢的花边和珠子。他们按照各族人民的兴趣爱好和生活习惯，织出了各种美丽的图案。在一寸多宽的花边上，竟织出了表示吉祥如意的龙凤飞舞、喜鹊闹梅的复杂图景。珠子，过去一直是从山东省淄博县运来。去年，淄博县派来了几位老工人，在昆明市帮助办起了一个珠子加工厂。当我们来这里访问的时候，三座炉子上正冒着熊熊的蓝色火焰。女工们在炉边拿着像一根麦芽糖似的塑料，用魔术师那样敏捷的手法制成一个个小圆珠珠。这些紫红、杏黄、天蓝、粉红、乳白、翠绿、翡翠各种颜色的珠子，可以做成项链，或者用来镶在衣服边沿和袖口上，都可以把少数民族的姑娘们打扮得更漂亮。
    当我们最后回到民族商品门市部的时候，已是深夜。灯影下，还有许多少数民族农民在兴冲冲地挑选自己最心爱的东西。（附图片）
