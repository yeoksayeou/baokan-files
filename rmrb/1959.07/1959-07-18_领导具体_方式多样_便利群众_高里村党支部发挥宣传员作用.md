Specific Leadership, Diverse Methods, Convenience for the Masses
Gaoli Village Party Branch Plays the Role of Propagandist

(Our report) How can a production team Party branch effectively lead the work of propagandists? How can we keep the propagandist team active and enable it to play a greater role in propaganda and mobilization among the masses? The Gaoli Village Production Team Party Branch of Changshou People's Commune in Xinle County, Hebei Province, has provided experience in this area.

　　Specific Person Responsible, Specific Leadership

The Gaoli Village Production Team Party Branch has always attached great importance to the work of propagandists. For several years, it has regarded leading the work of propagandists as a regular and important task of the branch, designating specific persons to be responsible for specific leadership. The propaganda work of the whole village is led by Guo Jie, deputy secretary of the Party branch, and Qi Chunhu (member of the Party branch), secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. Each of the eight production teams has a deputy captain in charge of ideological work to specifically manage the propaganda work of their team. In addition, each team is also assigned a Party branch member to provide regular assistance.

In leading the work of propagandists, some necessary research and inspection systems have also been established. At each Party branch meeting, the research and inspection of the work of propagandists is included as an item, and problems are discovered and solved. Each production team holds a special propagandist meeting every half month to check the progress of propaganda work in the past half month and to arrange new propaganda tasks and content. The Party branch holds a general meeting of all propagandists once a month to exchange propaganda experience and commend model propagandists. In April and May of this year, more than 180 outstanding propagandists in the village were commended. Because the whole village and each production team have designated persons in charge at each level, and there are regular research and inspection systems, the propaganda work of this village has played a great role in various tasks over the past few years.

　　Constantly Cultivating and Educating Propagandists

In the work of cultivating and educating propagandists, the branch first educates Party members and Youth League members to play a backbone and leading role. The Party and Youth League branches conduct education through Party and League classes, making them understand that it is the duty of every Communist Party member and Communist Youth League member to publicize and implement the Party's policies among the masses, to promote socialist and communist ideas, to raise the awareness of the masses, and to guide the masses forward. Therefore, they all actively take on the work of Party propagandists, and check their propaganda work on monthly Party and League member activity days. Driven by Party members and Youth League members, most of the propagandists are generally very active and motivated.

Helping propagandists clarify their propaganda ideas and providing propaganda materials in a timely manner is an important method for the Party branch to cultivate and improve propagandists and promote their work. After receiving instructions and notices from higher authorities, the Gaoli Village Production Team Party Branch first studies and researches them carefully at the branch meeting in light of the situation of the team, and formulates a plan for publicizing and implementing them among the masses. Then, during their spare time, they convene propagandists to give explanations and reports, and organize discussions to enable propagandists to truly understand the spirit of the Party's policies and clarify how they should carry out propaganda to achieve a clear understanding. In addition, the branch also pays attention to selecting materials from newspapers for propagandists to study and refer to, and provides specific assistance to those who have unclear explanations. Doing so further strengthens the confidence of propagandists in doing a good job in propaganda and increases their enthusiasm for work.

　　Beneficial to Production, Convenient for the Masses

Regarding the propaganda activities, forms, and methods of propagandists, the Party branch paid attention to guiding everyone to proceed from the premise of being beneficial to production and convenient for the masses. Any propaganda methods that are not adapted to the requirements of the commune members or the production situation are not adopted. The propaganda methods they often use are mainly oral propaganda anytime and anywhere in the fields, threshing grounds, dining areas, and visiting homes, as well as written propaganda such as blackboards, big-character posters, slogans, and cartoons, as well as singing and performing arts propaganda such as fast talk, drama, and songs. These propaganda methods do not affect production or the rest of the commune members, are popular with the masses, and have better propaganda results. For example, commune member Wang Xilai did not clearly understand the policy of distribution according to work. One day he fell ill, and doctor Bai Wenkui, who was a propagandist, promoted the policy of distribution according to work to him while treating him, explaining that his poor production was detrimental to himself, the team, and the country, thus helping Wang Xilai improve his ideological understanding. He said, "Bai Wenkui is a good doctor who cured my physical illness and also cured my ideological illness."

　　Three Requirements

In terms of giving play to the role of propagandists, the Gaoli Village Party Branch put forward three clear requirements to the propagandists: First, use all opportunities to publicize and achieve propaganda anytime and anywhere so that the Party's policies and tasks can meet with the masses in a timely manner; second, do what you publicize and set an example for the masses, and use your own actions to motivate others; third, maintain close contact with commune members, understand their demands and opinions, so that there is communication between the top and bottom, and further strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses. From the actual results in recent years, the vast majority of propagandists have achieved the above three points, effectively promoting the development of various tasks in the village.

    领导具体　方式多样　便利群众
    高里村党支部发挥宣传员作用
    本报讯　生产队党支部怎样领导好宣传员工作？怎样才能使宣传员队伍经常活跃，在群众中发挥更大的宣传鼓动作用？河北省新乐县长寿人民公社高里村生产队党支部提供了这一方面的经验。
      专人负责　具体领导
    高里村生产队党支部，对于宣传员工作一向是很重视的。几年来，一直把领导好宣传员工作，看成是支部的一项经常性的重要任务，明确专人负责，进行具体领导。全村的宣传员工作，由党支部副书记郭杰、共青团支部书记齐春虎（党支部委员）分工领导。八个生产小队，都设有一个负责思想工作的副队长，具体管理本小队的宣传员工作。另外每小队还确定由一个党支部委员经常进行帮助。
    在领导宣传员工作中，还建立了一些必要的研究、检查制度。在每次召开的党支部会议上，都把研究、检查宣传员工作列为一项内容，发现问题，解决问题。每个生产小队每半月专门召开一次宣传员会议，检查半月来的宣传工作开展情况，布置新的宣传任务和内容。党支部一个月召开一次全体宣传员大会，交流宣传经验，表扬模范宣传员。今年4、5两个月，全村受到表扬的优秀宣传员就有一百八十多名。由于全村和各生产小队层层设有专人管理，又有经常的研究、检查制度，所以几年来这村的宣传员工作在各项工作中发挥了很大作用。
      不断培养教育宣传员
    支部在培养、教育宣传员的工作中，首先是教育党员、团员起骨干、带头作用。党、团支部通过党课、团课进行教育，使他们都懂得了在群众中宣传贯彻党的政策，宣传社会主义和共产主义思想，提高群众觉悟，引导群众前进，是每个共产党员和共青团员的义务。因此，他们都积极地担任了党的宣传员工作，每月的党、团员活动日，还要检查自己作宣传工作的情况。在党员和团员的带动下，全体宣传员一般都很积极主动，工作情绪饱满。
    帮助宣传员明确宣传思想，及时供给宣传材料，是党支部培养提高宣传员、推动宣传员工作的一个重要方法。高里村生产队党支部每次接到上级指示、通知以后，都是先在支部会上结合本队情况认真学习研究，作出在群众中宣传贯彻的计划。然后利用业余时间，召集宣传员进行讲解报告，组织讨论，使宣传员真正领会党的政策精神，明确应该怎样作宣传，达到心中有数。另外，支部还注意从报纸上选择一些材料，供给宣传员宣传学习参考，见到宣传员有讲解不清的时候，就个别进行具体帮助。这样做，就更加坚定了宣传员做好宣传工作的信心，提高了宣传员的工作积极性。
      有利生产　便利群众
    在宣传员的宣传活动、形式和方法上，党支部注意了引导大家从有利于生产、便利于群众的前提出发。凡是对社员要求、对生产情况不相适应的宣传方式，就不采用。他们经常用的宣传方式，主要是地头、场边、饭场、串门访问、高房广播等随时随地的口头宣传，还有黑板报、大字报、标语口号、漫画等文字宣传，以及快板、戏剧、歌曲等演唱文艺宣传。这些宣传方式，都是既不影响生产，也不影响社员休息，为群众喜闻乐见，宣传效果也比较好。例如，社员王喜来对按劳分配的政策了解不清。有一天他生了病，医生白文奎是宣传员，一边给王喜来看病，一边给他宣传按劳分配的政策，说明自己生产不好对自己、对队、对国家都不利，就这样帮助王喜来提高了思想认识。他说，“白文奎是个好医生，治好了我身上的病，也治好了我思想上的病。”
            三项要求
    在发挥宣传员的作用方面，高里村党支部向宣传员明确提出了三项要求：一是利用各种机会宣传、做到随时随地宣传，使党的政策、任务及时和群众见面；二是自己怎样宣传，也要怎样去做，给群众作出样子，用自己的行动带动别人；三是密切和社员的联系，了解社员的要求、意见，使上下通气，进一步密切党和群众的联系。从这几年来的实际效果看，绝大部分的宣传员做到了以上三点，有力地推动了全村各种工作的开展。（附图片）
