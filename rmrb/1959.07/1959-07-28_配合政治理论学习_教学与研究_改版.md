    To Coordinate with Political Theory Studies
    "Teaching and Research" Revised

    (Our report) In order to coordinate with political theory studies and exchange experiences in theoretical learning, the "Teaching and Research" magazine, edited and published by the Renmin University of China, will be revised starting from the seventh issue.

    This magazine was founded in May 1953. In the past two or three years, the task of the journal has been to reflect and promote the teaching work and scientific research of the Renmin University of China. After the revision, the content will be concentrated, focusing on coordinating with the theoretical teaching of higher education institutions and the theoretical learning of working cadres, centering on the basic teaching materials of Marxist-Leninist theory courses, the third edition of the "Political Economy Textbook," principles of Marxist philosophy, and courses on the history of the Chinese Communist Party, and publishing corresponding papers. In addition, it will continue to publish manuscripts on philosophy and social sciences.

    The July issue of the journal published a special article entitled "We Must Seriously Read Books and Improve Teaching Methods." This paper put forward opinions on the current situation of teachers and students in colleges and universities in terms of teaching and learning theory. There are also three articles related to this special article. The interpretation and "simple notes" on Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" will be published successively starting from this issue. The "Learning Methods" for each chapter from Chapter 24 onwards of the third edition of the "Political Economy Textbook," as well as papers related to the main content of each chapter, will begin to be published from the August issue.
