Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 12th -- The land reform debate in the Cuban capital entered a heated stage last week. Representatives of the Cuban people and Latin American countries participating in the debate angrily condemned the American imperialism for cruelly plundering their wealth and hindering Latin America's economic development. The debate began on June 28 under the auspices of the "July 26th Movement." Representatives from ninety groups participated in the debate, including representatives from all walks of life, political parties, people's organizations, and government departments. Representatives from Central and South American countries and the press also participated in the debate.

    Marcelo Fernandez, the national leader of the Cuban "July 26th Movement," made a concluding speech last night on this stage of the debate, saying that the Cuban people are a poor people in a rich country because the huge resources do not belong to the Cuban people, but to American capital.

    He pointed out that "American capital currently controls 25% of bank deposits, 50% of railroads, more than 50% of coal production, and 40% of sugar." He used eloquent facts and materials to illustrate that American exploitation is the fundamental cause of poverty in Cuba and throughout Latin America, and is the main obstacle to their economic development. He said that the United States attempts to maintain the backward state of Cuba and Latin America in order to continue plundering more profits.

    Many representatives from farmers' associations, trade unions, and political parties unanimously pointed out in their speeches that implementing land reform is Cuba's urgent priority and a fundamental measure to advance the Cuban revolution. They cited the fact that American large estates occupy 25% of all cultivated land in Cuba, demonstrating that American imperialism is Cuba's main large estate owner.

    Since land reform has become an irresistible huge trend, the representatives of the national associations of large estate owners, landlords, and livestock owners participating in the debate could only covertly express their opposition to land reform in their speeches. They said that because land reform restricts the area of land ownership, it will destroy production management units, resulting in a decline in production; farmers, out of safety considerations, do not want to receive land for free, but want to buy land, and so on. However, all these fallacies of various kinds were refuted. Representatives of the People's Socialist Party said that cooperatives can fully guarantee a large increase in production. A representative of the Oriente Province Farmers' Association asked the representatives of the large estate owners present: Is the blood shed by the farmers to liberate the motherland and free them from the large estate system not enough? The large estate owners were speechless, and all other representatives responded with warm applause. Representatives of the armed forces expressed their determination to defend the land at the meeting. Captain Morales said that the rebel army stands with the people and will use weapons, fists, sticks, and stones to defend the land that the farmers should receive.

    Representatives from Latin American countries such as Peru, Guatemala, Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and Colombia, who participated in the debate, expressed their firm support for Cuba's land reform and believed that all other Latin American countries urgently need to carry out land reform because they are also subject to the exploitation of American imperialism. The Guatemalan representative condemned American imperialism for undermining Guatemala's land reform. The Mexican representative said that the era of farmers demanding to be land owners has arrived in Latin America. The Puerto Rican representative pointed out that the peoples of Latin American countries can only get rid of the exploitation of American imperialism if they unite. He said that the Latin American people must share life and death, prosperity and adversity.

    The people of the Cuban capital showed great enthusiasm for the debate. Every night all the spectator seats were packed with listeners. Many of the workers, farmers, and staff members had to work or go to work during the day, but still participated in the entire debate from ten o'clock in the evening until three o'clock in the morning. They often expressed their attitude towards the speeches of the representatives with long-lasting warm applause or silence. (Attached picture)

    各国代表在古巴土改辩论会上同声指出
    美国剥削是拉丁美洲贫困根源
    拉丁美洲各国人民必须生死与共安危同济
    新华社哈瓦那12日电　古巴首都土地改革辩论会上星期进入热烈辩论阶段。参加这个辩论会的古巴人民和拉丁美洲国家的代表在会上愤怒地谴责美帝国主义残酷地掠夺他们的财富和阻挠拉丁美洲的经济发展。辩论会是在6月28日在“7月26日运动”的主持下开始的。参加辩论会的有九十个团体的代表，其中有社会各界、政党、人民团体和政府各部的代表。参加辩论会的还有中南美洲国家的代表和新闻界。
    古巴“7月26日运动”全国领导人马塞洛·费尔南德思昨晚就这一阶段的辩论作总结发言说，古巴人民是一个富庶国家中的贫穷人民，因为巨大的富源不属于古巴人民，而是属于美国资本。
    他指出，“美国资本目前控制着25％的银行存款，50％的铁路，50％以上的煤产和40％的糖”。他以雄辩的事实和材料，说明美国的剥削是造成古巴和整个拉丁美洲贫困的根本原因，是它们经济发展的主要障碍。他说，美国企图保持古巴和拉丁美洲的落后状态，以便继续掠夺更多的利润。
    农民协会、工会团体和政党的许多代表在发言时一致指出，实行土地改革是古巴刻不容缓的当务之急，是使古巴革命向前发展的根本措施。他们列举美国大庄园占有古巴全部耕地的25％这一事实，说明美帝国主义是古巴主要的大庄园主。
    由于土地改革已经成为不可抗拒的巨大潮流，参加辩论会的大庄园主、地主和畜牧业主全国性协会的代表发言时只能隐蔽地表示反对土地改革。他们说，由于土地改革限制占有土地的面积，就会破坏生产管理单位，结果将使生产下降；农民出于安全考虑，不希望无偿地得到土地，而是希望买地等等。但是，所有这些形形色色的谬论都遭到了驳斥。人民社会党的代表说，合作社完全可以保证大大地增加生产。奥连特省农民协会代表向在场的大庄园主代表问道：难道农民为解放祖国和使他摆脱大庄园制所流的血还不够？在场的大庄园主哑口无言，所有其他代表则报以热烈的掌声。武装部队的代表们在会上表示了他们坚决保卫土地的意志。莫拉莱斯上尉说，起义军和人民站在一起，并且要用武器、拳头、棍棒和石块保卫农民应该得到的土地。
    参加这个辩论会的秘鲁、危地马拉、墨西哥、智利、委内瑞拉、波多黎各和哥伦比亚等拉丁美洲国家的代表，表示坚决支持古巴的土地改革，并且认为，所有拉丁美洲其他国家都迫切需要进行土地改革，因为它们也同样受着美帝国主义的剥削。危地马拉代表谴责美帝国主义破坏了危地马拉的土地改革。墨西哥代表说，农民要求做土地主人的时代已经来到了拉丁美洲。波多黎各代表指出，拉丁美洲各国人民只有团结起来，才能摆脱美帝国主义的剥削。他说，拉丁美洲人民要生死与共、安危共济。
    古巴首都人民对辩论会表现了极大的热情。每天晚上所有的旁听席都挤满了听众。其中许多工人、农民和职员白天要上工或上班，但仍然参加了从晚上十点直到黎明三点的全部辩论。他们常以经久不息的热烈掌声或沉默来表示他们对各个代表发言的态度。（附图片）
