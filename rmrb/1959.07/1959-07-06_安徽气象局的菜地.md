    The Anhui Meteorological Bureau's Vegetable Garden
    By Our Correspondent Han Guozhen
    Walking into the Anhui Provincial Meteorological Bureau, one is immediately drawn in by the surging atmosphere of labor and the orderly production scene.

    Following the person in charge of the Production Management Committee, I visited the bureau's vegetable plots. In the neat, level fields, eggplants, peppers, and tomatoes were already laden on the branches. In the newly reclaimed pumpkin patches on the barren hills, pumpkins of all sizes were hiding beneath the green leaves. Trellises were set up like drying racks, covered with long cucumbers and gourds.

    Looking around, the verdant vegetable plots were interspersed with the sporadic yellow pumpkin flowers and white gourd blossoms, as well as the cucumbers and gourds hanging from the trellises... It was truly hard to believe that these were vegetable plots planted by office cadres in their spare time! One would think they had arrived at an outstanding vegetable garden.

    Why are the vegetables grown by the cadres of the Anhui Provincial Meteorological Bureau so excellent? The comrade leading my tour said that this is inseparable from the Party branch's attention and Director Peng Lichang's leadership. As early as 1956, when Director Peng had just been transferred to the Meteorological Bureau, he used the open spaces within the bureau to plant all kinds of vegetables himself. In these past few years, Director Peng's family of eight has relied on the vegetables from the more than one mu of land he cultivated himself to solve their vegetable consumption. Every winter, pumpkins and Chinese cabbage are always piled up in the house; if they can't finish the vegetables, they are sent to the canteen. Every cadre in the Meteorological Bureau has eaten vegetables grown by Director Peng himself.

    This April, after the Provincial Party Committee issued the call for office cadres to carry out agricultural and sideline production in their spare time on vacant land, Director Peng actively led all the cadres of the bureau to reclaim wasteland and plant vegetables. The Party branch even made vigorously promoting agricultural and sideline production a key focus of its work. Every meeting included research, discussion, summarization, and arrangements for production. Under the leadership of the Party branch, a Production Management Committee and a Production Technology Group were established, with dedicated personnel responsible for leading the bureau's production, which is why the bureau's production has been so outstanding.

    What used to be a barren hillside has now been reclaimed into terraced fields, planted with tomatoes, pumpkins, and corn; what used to be a barren gully has now been filled in and turned into fertile land, planted with mung beans and various melons and vegetables. The comrade in charge of the Production Management Committee, who led my tour, pointed to the strong-stalked, leafy corn and soybeans in front of us and said: "Originally, these were all barren hillsides, full of weeds, and the soil was very poor. The beans and vegetables planted here could never be seen growing. Some time ago, a comrade from the bureau went to town and saw houses being demolished, so he suggested to the bureau that the wall soil be transported back as fertilizer. Our Production Management Committee then mobilized all the cadres to transport back some old wall soil and apply it to the land. As a result, the corn and beans quickly changed their appearance."

    After two months of production, the more than ten mu of land reclaimed within the bureau have already yielded more than a thousand jin of various vegetables. Since late May, the entire bureau has achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables. At the same time, because of the good planting, cucumbers, eggplants, and other vegetables matured earlier than those in the market. As a result, the vegetables sold in the Meteorological Bureau's canteen are not only fresh but also cheap. In order to ensure the bureau's self-sufficiency in vegetables throughout the year, the Meteorological Bureau's Production Management Committee has made detailed arrangements for the planting and storage of vegetables. It has been decided that all storable and pickleable melons and vegetables will be stored for consumption in the winter.

    安徽气象局的菜地
    本报记者　韩国珍
    走进安徽省气象局，就被人们高涨的劳动气氛和井然有序的生产景象所吸引。
    记者随着生产管理委员会的负责人参观了这个机关的蔬菜地。整齐、平坦的一丘丘菜墒里，茄子、辣椒、蕃茄都已经结满枝头。荒山上新开垦的一窝窝的南瓜地里，大大小小的南瓜也都躲在绿色的叶子下面。一块块搭成晾棚似的瓜棚上，挂满了一条条的黄瓜、瓠子。
    举目望去，一片葱绿的蔬菜地里，夹杂着星星的黄色的南瓜花和白色的瓠子花，以及挂满棚架的黄瓜、瓠子……。确实令人难以置信这是机关干部业余种植的蔬菜地！倒使人感到这是来到一个出色的蔬菜园了。
    安徽省气象局干部种植的蔬菜，为什么搞得这样出色呢？带领我参观的同志说，这是与党支部的重视和彭利昌局长的带头分不开的。早在1956年，彭局长刚调来气象局时，他便自个儿利用机关内的空隙地，种上各种各样的蔬菜。这几年，彭局长家全家八口人，就是靠他自己开垦的一亩多地的蔬菜解决吃菜问题。每到冬天，南瓜、大白菜总是堆满一屋；菜吃不完，便送到食堂去。气象局的干部，每个人都吃过彭局长亲手种的菜。
    今年4月，省委发出机关干部利用业余时间，在空隙地上开展农副业生产的号召后，彭局长又积极领着全机关的干部，开荒地，种蔬菜。党支部更是把大搞农副业生产作为支部工作的重点，每次开会都要研究、讨论生产，总结和布置生产。在支部领导下，成立了生产管理委员会和生产技术小组，由专人负责领导机关生产，因而局里的生产搞得非常出色。
    原来是荒山坡的，现在已经开垦成为梯田，种上了蕃茄、南瓜和玉米；原来是荒山沟的，现在也已填平，变成了一墒墒的良田，种上了绿豆和各种瓜菜。带领我参观的这位生产管理委员会的负责同志，指着面前一片长得秆壮、叶肥的玉米和黄豆地说：原来这些都是荒山坡，满山的荒草，土质很坏，豆子、蔬菜种下去总是看不见长。前些时，局里有一位同志上街，看见有拆盖房屋的，便向局里建议，把墙土运回来作肥料。我们生产管理委员会便发动了全体干部，运回了一些老墙土，施在地里，结果玉米、豆子很快地变了样。
    经过两个月来的生产，机关内开垦的十多亩地里，已经收获了一千多斤各种蔬菜。从5月下旬起，全机关已经做到了蔬菜自给。同时，由于种得好，黄瓜、茄子等比市场上还成熟得早些。因而气象局食堂里卖的菜，不仅新鲜，而且便宜。为了保证机关内蔬菜全年自给，气象局生产管理委员会，对蔬菜的种植和储存，又都作了详细安排。决定将可储放的、可腌的瓜菜都储存起来，留着冬天吃。
