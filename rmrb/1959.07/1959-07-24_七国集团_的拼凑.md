    The Patchwork of the "Group of Seven"
    By Our Correspondent Su Lan
    The ministerial meeting of the "Small Free Trade Area," led by Britain and including Sweden, Norway, Austria, Denmark, Portugal, and Switzerland (the "Group of Seven"), concluded in Stockholm on the 21st. The meeting adopted a "Draft Plan for the Establishment of a European Free Trade Association," deciding to draft a convention based on this draft to formally establish an economic bloc to rival the "Common Market" of West Germany and France.
    The so-called "Group of Seven" participating in the "Small Free Trade Area" is a microcosm of the "European Free Trade Area Plan" previously advocated by Britain. It is a further effort by Britain to contend for hegemony in Western Europe. Since the "Common Market" rejected the "Free Trade Area Plan," Britain had been indecisive for a time. Judging from the current situation, Britain is determined to regroup and use the organization of the "Group of Seven" as a means to counter the "Common Market."
    The meeting of officials from the seven countries held in early June decided to abolish industrial tariffs among the seven countries within ten years, a plan that has been approved by the recently concluded ministerial meeting. This is considered the first step in organizing the "Small Free Trade Area." However, a major obstacle has not been eliminated, namely the issue of Denmark's agricultural product outlets. Agricultural products account for more than 50% of Denmark's exports. It maintains significant trade relations with both Britain and West Germany. Therefore, it is unwilling to abandon its market in West Germany and join the "Small Free Trade Area" without compensation. If Denmark does not participate, other countries such as Austria and Norway will also adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards the "Small Free Trade Area." In order to bring Denmark into the "Group of Seven," Britain had to conduct bilateral negotiations with Denmark. As a result of the negotiations, Britain reduced tariffs on imports of certain Danish agricultural products. In other words, Britain sacrificed seven million pounds a year to gain Denmark's agreement to join the "Group of Seven." The communique of the seven-nation ministerial meeting also clearly stated: "A special agreement will be signed on agriculture... to be handled as a separate issue." But in this way, it will inevitably harm the interests of some agricultural capitalists in Britain. The British Agricultural Association had already passed a resolution before this ministerial meeting, opposing Britain's concessions to Denmark.
    These internal difficulties and contradictions have led some British newspapers to comment on the "Small Free Trade Area Plan" from the beginning with a low-key tone. They believe it is only "better than nothing."
    So, why is the British government so actively organizing the "Group of Seven"?
    As everyone knows, since the failure of the "Free Trade Area" negotiations, the "Common Market" has repeatedly suggested that the countries of the "European Economic Cooperation Organization" separately conclude bilateral agreements. If the "Common Market" countries' proposals are realized, Britain would be isolated, and the consequence would likely be economic and political exclusion from the European continent. This terrifying prospect prompted Britain to "make a decisive decision" and try every means to bring Sweden, Norway, Austria, Denmark, Portugal, and Switzerland into a group, on the one hand to maintain its own market in Western Europe, and on the other hand to have bargaining chips with the "Common Market."
    In this struggle, Britain is not entirely on the defensive. Britain hopes to use the "Group of Seven" to exert pressure on the six countries of the "Common Market," first and foremost West Germany. The economic relations between West Germany and the Nordic countries are very close. Last year, West Germany's exports to Sweden accounted for 22% of Sweden's total imports, and West Germany accounted for 20% of Norway's total imports. During the same period, Britain's share accounted for only 12% of Sweden's total imports and 16% of Norway's. The accession of the Scandinavian countries to the "Small Free Trade Area" will cause West Germany to lose a very important market. Britain is precisely using this situation to try to divide the "Common Market," soften the attitude of the "Common Market" countries, and resume negotiations on the "Free Trade Area" plan under conditions favorable to itself.
    As Britain intensifies its activities to organize the "Group of Seven," the political and economic struggle between Britain on the one hand and France and West Germany on the other will become more acute. However, in this struggle, Britain is still at a disadvantage. The economic strength of the "Group of Seven" is clearly not comparable to that of the "Common Market." The "Common Market" has 166 million consumers, its industrial production accounts for 21.6% of the total industrial output of the capitalist world, and its exports account for 24.1%. In the "Group of Seven," with a population of only 88.3 million, their industrial output accounts for only 11.3% of the capitalist world and their exports account for only 16.8%. And Britain's share in the industrial output of the seven countries reaches two-thirds.
    Although British newspapers had been constantly clamoring that splitting Europe was unacceptable before this ministerial meeting, the political and economic division of Europe is developing further.

### 七国集团”的拼凑

    七国集团”的拼凑
    本报记者　苏蓝
    以英国为首、包括瑞典、挪威、奥地利、丹麦、葡萄牙和瑞士六国在内的“小自由贸易区”部长级会议，21日已在斯德哥尔摩闭幕。会议通过了“成立欧洲自由贸易联盟计划草案”，决定在这个草案基础上，起草一项公约，正式建立同西德和法国的“共同市场”对垒的经济集团。
    参加所谓“小自由贸易区”的“七国集团”是英国以前所倡议的“欧洲自由贸易区计划”的缩影。是英国争夺西欧霸权的进一步努力。自从“共同市场”拒绝“自由贸易区计划”后，英国一时曾举棋不定。从现在的情况看来，英国已决心重整旗鼓，以组织“七国集团”为手段，同“共同市场”抗衡。
    6月初举行的七国官员会议，决定了在十年内七国之间废除工业关税，这项计划已为最近闭幕的部长级会议所批准。这算是组织“小自由贸易区”的第一步。但是，一个巨大的障碍并没有消除，这就是丹麦的农产品出路问题。丹麦在它的出口货物中，农产品占50％以上。它和英国、西德都保持着大量的贸易关系。因此，它不愿意放弃自己在西德的市场，而无代价地加入“小自由贸易区”。如果丹麦不参加，其它某些国家如奥地利、挪威等，也将对“小自由贸易区”抱观望态度。英国为了把丹麦拉进“七国集团”，不得不和丹麦进行双边谈判。谈判的结果是，英国对丹麦某些农产品的入口减低了关税。也就是说，英国以每年牺牲七百万英镑的代价，换得了丹麦同意加入“七国集团”。这次七国部长会议公报中，也明白宣布：“在农业方面将签订一项特别协定……，作为独立的问题来处理”。但这样一来，将不能不反转来损害到英国某些农业资本家的利益。英国农业主协会在这次部长级会议以前已经通过决议，反对英国对丹麦的让步。
    这种内在困难和矛盾，使英国一些报纸一开始就以低沉的论调来评论“小自由贸易区计划”。它们认为这只是“聊胜于无”。
    那么，英国政府又为什么这样积极组织“七国集团”呢？
    大家知道，自从“自由贸易区”谈判失败以后，“共同市场”一再建议同“欧洲经济合作组织”各国分别订立双边协定。“共同市场”国家的建议如果实现，英国便会陷于孤立，其后果将可能是在经济上和政治上都被排斥在欧洲大陆之外。这一恐怖的前景，推动英国“当机立断”，想尽一切办法，把瑞典、挪威、奥地利、丹麦、葡萄牙和瑞士六国拉到一个集团里来，一方面保持自己在西欧的市场，另一方面也有了和“共同市场”讨价还价的本钱。
    在这一场斗争中，英国并不完全处于防御地位。英国指望以“七国集团”对“共同市场”六国，首先是对西德施加压力。西德和北欧国家的经济关系是十分密切的。去年，西德向瑞典的输出占瑞典总入口的22％，在挪威的总入口中西德占20％。而在同一时期内，英国的分额，在瑞典的总入口中只占12％；在挪威占16％。斯堪的纳维亚国家的加入“小自由贸易区”，将使西德失掉一个十分重要的市场。英国正是利用这一情况，企图分化“共同市场”，软化“共同市场”国家的态度，在有利于自己的条件下，恢复对“自由贸易区”计划的谈判。
    随着英国加紧组织“七国集团”的活动，以英国为一方，以法国、西德为另一方的政治和经济斗争，将更加尖锐。但是，在这场斗争中，英国目前仍是处于劣势的。“七国集团”的经济实力，显然不能和“共同市场”匹敌。“共同市场”拥有一亿六千六百万的消费者，它的工业生产，占资本主义世界工业总产量的21.6％，出口占24.1％。在只有八千八百三十万人口的“七国集团”中，它们的工业产量，在资本主义世界中只占11.3％，出口只占16.8％。而在七国的工业生产量中，英国的分额达三分之二。
    尽管在这次部长级会议召开以前，英国报纸早已不断叫嚷分裂欧洲是要不得的，但是，欧洲在政治上和经济上的分裂已在进一步发展中。
