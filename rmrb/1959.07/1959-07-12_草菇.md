    Straw Mushroom

    The straw mushroom is an edible fungus cultivated on rice straw, similar in appearance to the northern mushroom, and produced in many provinces in the south of the Yangtze River. Straw mushrooms have a delicious flavor and are rich in nutrients, making them a very good non-staple food.

    The main raw material for producing straw mushrooms is rice straw. After the rice straw used to produce straw mushrooms is fermented, it is inoculated with spawn (straw that has produced straw mushrooms or mature straw mushrooms), and under appropriate temperature and humidity, the straw mushrooms will gradually grow.

    草菇
    草菇是在稻草上培育出来的一种食菌，外形和北方的蘑菇相似，江南各省多有生产。草菇味鲜美，营养丰富，是一种很好的副食品。
    生产草菇的主要原料是稻草。生产草菇的稻草发酵以后，接种上菌种（生产过草菇的草或成熟的草菇），在适当的温度、湿度下，草菇就陆续长出来。
