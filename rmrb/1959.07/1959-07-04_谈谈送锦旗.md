    On Sending Silk Banners
    Recently, the trend of sending silk banners among some enterprises has become very popular. It is a bit wasteful. I suggest that if factories want to express their gratitude and respect, they can write a letter or even draw some pictures to give to the other party. This can save money and make the affection last longer. Ji Yuanlong

    谈谈送锦旗
    近来，有些企业送锦旗的风气很盛。实在有点浪费。我建议各厂要想表示感谢和敬意，可以写一封信，甚至画上一些画，赠给对方。这样既可省钱，而且情意更长了。　计元龙
