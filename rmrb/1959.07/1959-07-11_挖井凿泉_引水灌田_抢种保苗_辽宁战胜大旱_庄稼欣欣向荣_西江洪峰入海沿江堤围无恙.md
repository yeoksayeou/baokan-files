Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th: Liaoning peasants have achieved a significant victory in their fight against drought. The autumn crops, sown before the rain through drought resistance and replanted after the rain, are generally thriving. In the area along the Liao River, which was severely dry in May, the land is now covered in green. Sorghum and millet have grown to two or three feet tall, cotton is budding, early-sown corn has large leaves and thick stalks, and is lush and dark green. Summer harvest crops such as wheat and potatoes are ripening one after another. Currently, farmers throughout the province are simultaneously harvesting summer crops and intensifying efforts to cultivate, weed, fertilize, and exterminate insects for the autumn crops, launching a comprehensive seedling upgrade campaign, while also preparing for flood prevention.

Rain began to fall in parts of Liaoning Province from June 5th, and after June 11th, the entire province received thorough rainfall. Prior to this, starting in May, most areas of Liaoning Province had not received rain for forty to fifty consecutive days. In some mountainous areas, the drought was even more severe, and the seedlings of early-sown crops became thin, yellowed, and withered due to the drought.

However, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Liaoning Province rose up to fight the drought and overcame the threat of natural disaster. In a short period, Shuangta Commune in Xinjin County dug more than a thousand wells, opened sixty springs, and excavated more than four hundred river-center water sources, enabling all the commune's fruit trees, rice, wheat, and vegetables to be irrigated. After half a month of hard work, the communes in Fuxian County irrigated more than five thousand mu of wheat fields, nearly four thousand mu of potatoes, and more than five hundred thousand fruit trees. According to incomplete statistics, during the drought resistance struggle, the area of land where water was seized to irrigate and protect seedlings reached 1.3 million mu, and the area sown by drought-resistant methods reached more than 10 million mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th: The flood peak of the Xijiang River has now passed through the Pearl River Delta river network area and entered the sea. All embankments along the river remain safe and sound under the close guard of the flood prevention army.

The flood peak that appeared at the Gaoyao station of the Xijiang River yesterday morning reached the Sanshui station at 8:00 p.m. that day. The flood peak water level at Sanshui was 7.28 meters, exceeding the warning level by 0.78 meters. After passing through Sanshui, the flood peak flowed through the Pearl River Delta river network area and entered the sea. As of 2:00 p.m. today, the water level at Gaoyao station had dropped to 9.58 meters, 0.38 meters lower than the flood peak water level at 7:00 a.m. yesterday; the water level at Sanshui station had dropped to 7.16 meters, 0.12 meters lower than the flood peak water level. It is expected that the water levels at Gaoyao station and Sanshui station will recede below the warning level tomorrow afternoon and evening.

    挖井凿泉　引水灌田　抢种保苗
    辽宁战胜大旱　庄稼欣欣向荣
    西江洪峰入海沿江堤围无恙
    据新华社沈阳8日电　辽宁农民的抗旱斗争取得重大胜利。雨前抗旱播种和雨后抢种的大秋作物禾苗普遍欣欣向荣。在5月还是十分干旱的辽河两岸，现在大地上已呈现一片绿色。高粱、谷子已长到两三尺高，棉花已经现蕾，早播玉米叶大秆粗，绿得油黑，小麦、土豆等夏收作物已陆续成熟。目前全省各地农民正在一面收割夏收作物，一面为大秋作物加紧铲趟除草，追肥，灭虫，全面地掀起禾苗升级运动，同时准备防汛。
    辽宁部分地区从6月5日起开始下雨，到6月11日以后，全省各地陆续下透。而在此以前，从5月开始，辽宁省大部地区曾连续四五十天未落雨。在某些山地，干旱程度更为严重，早期播种作物的禾苗受旱后变得瘦黄枯萎。
    但是辽宁省人民在党的领导下，奋起抗旱，战胜了自然灾害的威胁。新金县双塔公社在很短时间就挖井一千多眼，凿泉六十个，并挖河心水四百多处，使全社的果树、水稻、小麦、蔬菜等全部灌上了水。复县各公社经过半月的奋战，使五千多亩麦田、近四千亩土豆和五十多万棵果树得到灌溉。据不完全统计，在抗旱斗争中，全省夺水灌田保苗的面积达一百三十万亩，抗旱坐水播种的面积达一千多万亩。
    新华社广州10日电　广东西江洪峰，今天已经通过珠江三角洲河网地带入海。沿江堤围在防洪大军严密守护下，全部安然无恙。
    西江昨天上午在高要站出现的洪峰，于当日下午八时到达三水站，三水洪峰水位为七点二八米，超过警戒水位零点七八米。洪峰经过三水后，随即流经珠江三角洲河网地区入海。到今天下午二时，高要站水位已降到九点五八米，比昨天上午七时洪峰水位下降了零点三八米；三水站水位已降到七点一六米，比洪峰水位下退了零点一二米。预计明天下午和晚上，高要站和三水站的水位可先后退到警戒水位以下。
