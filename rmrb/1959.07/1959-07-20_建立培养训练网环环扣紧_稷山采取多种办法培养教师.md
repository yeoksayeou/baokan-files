Establishing a Tightly Integrated Teacher Training Network
Jishan Adopts Multiple Methods to Train Teachers

(Our dispatch) To improve the level of teachers and improve teaching, Jishan County, Shanxi Province, has established a teacher training network. Through learning, teachers' political and cultural level and teaching quality have been significantly improved.

With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in Jishan County, education has also greatly developed. In this way, the contradiction between the quantity and quality of teachers has become more prominent. Among the more than 2,000 primary school teachers in the county, more than 40% are below the level of junior teachers, and the more than 2,000 new primary and secondary school teachers selected from rural areas also need to be trained and improved.

In order to solve this problem, the Jishan County Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted a special study and established a county-wide teacher training network led by "one committee," based on learning mutual assistance groups, and composed of "two schools, two offices, and twenty stations," combining long-term teacher training, short-term training, and on-the-job training.

"One committee" means that under the leadership of the Jishan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, a teacher training committee is formed, headed by the secretary of the county committee in charge of cultural and educational work, to uniformly lead, plan, and arrange the entire teacher training work. "Two schools" are the normal school and the correspondence normal school. The normal school is divided into two departments: one is a specialized department for training new junior high school teachers; the other is a training department, with one class for primary school teachers and three classes for kindergarten teachers. The correspondence normal school is specifically responsible for the cultural and professional learning of in-service teachers, mainly primary school teachers, including some middle school teachers who are below the level of secondary normal school, accounting for 84.5% of the county's primary and secondary school teachers. Now, except for teachers with secondary normal school level or above, who are organized by the school to study and help each other, all primary and secondary school and kindergarten teachers in the county have participated in the learning of the above-mentioned "two schools." "Two offices" are the political theory teaching and research office and the education teaching and research office. The former is responsible for the political study of teachers; the latter is responsible for the teaching research work of teachers, guiding the teaching and research group activities of schools, to help teachers improve their professional level in practical work. "Twenty stations" are teacher learning guidance stations set up in various communes throughout the county, which are teaching bases for correspondence normal schools and political theory teaching and research offices. Teachers use two Sundays a month to go to the station to listen to political theory and cultural and professional lessons once each. Under the "station," teacher learning guidance groups are set up by school district (there are ninety-eight in the county). Teachers gather in the guidance group twice a month, with counselors tutoring them in learning, checking homework, and organizing discussions. Under the guidance group is the teacher learning mutual assistance group (that is, the teaching research group), which conducts learning through individual reading and joint research. In this way, through the three forms of guidance station, guidance group, and learning mutual assistance group, lecturing, tutoring, and learning mutual assistance are organically combined. At the same time, from organizational leadership to specific arrangements, there are specific measures, and political, cultural, and professional learning are closely integrated.

After more than a year of training, correspondence courses, and on-the-job training, the county's primary and secondary school teachers have not only improved their political awareness, but also significantly improved their teaching quality. In the past year, the political and ideological situation of teachers has undergone great changes. Most of the people who were not at ease with education work have decided to make education their lifelong career after studying. Three hundred and five primary and secondary school teachers have been admitted to the Party, and six hundred and forty-five have been admitted to the League. Now, the number of Party and League members in primary and secondary schools has increased from only 27% at the beginning of last year to 44%. In terms of cultural level and teaching skills, of the 1,542 people who have been trained and participated in on-the-job training, more than 80% have basically reached the level of graduation from junior normal school, which is very different from the situation at the beginning of last year when more than 40% of primary school teachers were below the level of junior normal school. In particular, most of the 2,000 new teachers have been able to take on teaching work. Many of the original teachers and new teachers did not know how to prepare lessons, teach classes, analyze texts, or grade homework before. After studying in various forms, they have initially mastered the skills of teacher work, and many have become very good teachers. Zhang Yujie, a teacher at Siwang Elementary School, could only read word by word from the textbook when she started teaching, and she couldn't even figure out the theme. Now that she has completed the junior normal school course, she not only does a good job in teaching, but also writes many stories in combination with reality to conduct moral education for primary school students, which has achieved good results. Therefore, she was rated as an excellent teacher. Some teachers described the situation before and after learning: Before learning: worried before class, bored after class, the level is too shallow to be competent, check the dictionary, copy the reference, do not know why, mix blindly. After learning: confidence is great, enthusiasm is high, the quality of teaching is good every day, knowing the difficulties, not arrogant, strive for red and expert and further study.

    建立培养训练网环环扣紧
    稷山采取多种办法培养教师
    本报讯　为了提高教师水平，搞好教学，山西稷山县建立了培养训练教师网，教师们经过学习，政治文化水平和教学质量显著提高。
    稷山县随着工农业生产大跃进，教育事业也有很大的发展。这样，教师的数量和质量之间的矛盾，显得更加突出。全县两千多名小学教师中，就有40％以上不及初师程度，而从农村中选拔的两千多名中小学新教师，也需要培养和提高。
    为了解决这一问题，中共稷山县委进行了专门研究，并在全县范围内建立起一个以“一会”为领导，以学习互助组为基础，由“二校、二室、二十站”所组成的全县教师培养训练网，将教师的长期培养、短期轮训、在职进修结合在一起。
  “一会”就是在中共稷山县委会的领导下，由县委负责文教工作的书记挂帅，组成教师训练委员会，统一领导、规划和安排整个教师培养训练工作。“二校”是师范学校和函授师范学校，师范学校分两部；一部是专修部，培养初中新教师；另一部是轮训部，有小学教师班一个班，幼儿教师班三个班。函授师范学校专门负责在职教师的文化业务学习，主要是小学教师，包括部分不及中等师范程度的中学教师，占全县中小学教师84.5％。现在，除了中等师范程度以上的教师，由学校组织自学互助外，全县中小学和幼儿园教师全部参加了上述“二校”的学习。“二室”是政治理论教研室和教育教研室。前者，负责教师的政治学习；后者，负责教师的教学研究工作，指导学校的教研组活动，以帮助教师在实际工作中提高业务水平。“二十站”是设在全县各个公社的教师学习指导站，是函授师范学校和政治理论教研室的教学据点。教师每月利用两个星期日到站听政治理论和文化业务课各一次。“站”下以学区为单位，设有教师学习指导组（全县共九十八个）。教师每月集中到指导组两次，由辅导员辅导学习，检查作业，组织讨论。指导组之下，即为教师的学习互助小组（也就是教学研究小组），以个人阅读、共同研究等方式，进行学习。这样，通过指导站、指导组，学习互助小组的三重形式、就把讲授、辅导、学习互助，有机地结合起来。同时，从组织领导到具体安排上，都有了具体措施，政治、文化、业务学习也是互相紧密结合的。
    全县中小学教师，经过一年多的轮训、函授、在职进修等学习，不仅提高了政治觉悟，教学质量也显著地提高了。一年来，教师的政治思想情况，已发生了很大的变化，原来不安心教育工作的人，经过学习，大多数人都决心把教育事业做为自己的终身事业。已被吸收入党的中小学教师有三百零五人，六百四十五人被吸收入团。现在，中小学教师中的党团员已比去年初只占27％增加到44％。在文化水平和教学的业务上，就轮训和参加在职进修的一千五百四十二人来看，已有80％以上基本上达到了初师毕业水平，和去年初有40％以上的小学教师不到初师程度的情况相比，已经大大地不同了。特别是两千名新教师，他们之中大多数已经能够担负起教学工作。原有教师和新教师，以前有很多人不知怎么备课、上课、分析课文、批改作业等，经过各种形式的学习后，已经初步地掌握了教师工作的业务，并有不少人成了很好的教师。四望小学教师张玉洁，开始教学时只会照课本一字一字地念，连主题都搞不清，现在学完了初师课程，不但教学工作做得很好，而且结合实际编写了许多故事，对小学生们进行品德教育，收到很好的效果，因此被评为优秀教师。有的教师这样描绘学习前后的情况：学习前：课前愁、课后闷，水平太浅难胜任，查字典、抄参考，不知其然瞎胡混。学习后：信心大、干劲高，教学质量天天好，知艰难，不骄傲，力争红专再深造。（附图片）
