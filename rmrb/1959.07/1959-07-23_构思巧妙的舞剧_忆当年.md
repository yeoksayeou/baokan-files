In the Second Literary and Art Assembly of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Wuhan Military Region Song and Dance Troupe performed a dance drama called "Remembering the Past." It is only a short dance drama lasting about fifteen minutes, but I think it carries a lot of weight. To be honest, I have seen quite a few newly created dance dramas and dances recently, and few have left a deep impression. Some are easily forgotten after watching, but this short dance drama is unforgettable for a long time.

The plot of the dance drama "Remembering the Past" unfolds in front of a giant painting of the Eighteen Warriors Crossing the Dadu River in the Red Army Museum. The continuous stream of visitors shows an atmosphere of peaceful and happy life. At this time, a general who experienced the Long March and the Battle of Dadu River appears with his family. The general stands in front of the giant painting and falls into contemplation, recalling the battles of the past. Suddenly, the giant painting comes to life. This is the general's reverie, and the stage image also helps the audience to fly with the general's memories, revisiting the arduous battles of the past, and once again learning from the images of these eighteen loyal proletarian warriors the power of the Party and revolutionary achievements. At the end of the dance drama, when the general turns from his memories, he continues to tell the story of the past to the visitors in front of the giant painting...

This is a very concise, novel, poetic, and artistically infectious good dance drama with rich ideological content. The choreographer's conception is very bold and clever. From the perspective of the theme, the moving story of the Eighteen Warriors Crossing the Dadu River is already familiar to us, but the revolutionary struggle at that time can only inspire people to think deeply and stimulate greater enthusiasm for socialist construction when contrasted with today's happy life. This theme is well expressed through a clever artistic structure, using its vivid artistic image to embody it. The choreographer skillfully combines the events of two different revolutionary historical stages, separated by more than twenty years, with just a few strokes. There is only a painting, a general who used to be a person in the painting, plus some people visiting the Red Army Museum. We don't need to see the entire experience of the Eighteen Warriors Crossing the Dadu River in the dance drama, nor do we need to focus on how to introduce the new society and the visitors in today's dance drama, or even to introduce the general in detail. The theme is portrayed very vividly simply through the general's momentary memory as a visitor. This rigorous structure and concise technique are worth learning. In this dance drama, the choreographer does not say everything, but leaves room for the audience to think. The dance drama itself is over, but the artistic image of the dance drama and the essential theme it displays continue to be active in the audience's thinking, inspiring deep thought.

The choreographer's bold conception is also reflected in the giant painting of the Dadu River crossing. This carefully designed giant painting, composed of the highly artistic shapes of eighteen actors, is very successful and has great artistic appeal. At first glance on the stage, it looks like an outstanding oil painting. It is excellent in terms of character, depth of expression, color tone, and composition. But because it is composed of real people, with living thoughts and emotions and the special artistic charm under the stage lights, it creates a very moving artistic atmosphere on the stage. The core part of the dance drama is unfolded by this giant painting and the subsequent activities of the heroes in the painting. It seems that this technique can only be fully utilized in dance, except in some mythological dramas. The choreographer's thinking in this regard is by no means accidental. He fully realizes what kind of material is suitable for what kind of expression, pays attention to the characteristics of dance art methods and the relationship between the selection of themes, and also repeatedly uses it in the dance drama. For example, at the end of the dance drama, we saw two overlapping still images. That is, in front of the giant painting of the Eighteen Warriors Crossing the Dadu River, there appeared another scene of the general continuing to tell the story of the battle to the visitors. The dance drama closes in these two overlapping pictures. These two pictures give people a very prominent impression. Although they are both static, they contain infinite movement.

Perhaps some people will say that there are more pantomime elements in it, and there is no dance in the front and rear parts of the dance drama. However, I think it is harmless. The dance drama is originally a musical drama work performed by means of dance and pantomime (expression, posture). Although there are many pantomime elements in this dance drama, the choreographer uses a new method to deal with pantomime, which is to use the shape of the giant painting as the background. The shape of the giant painting contains intense movement. In front of such a shape, even if other actors do not dance, it will not feel like a pantomime without dance.

In short, this dance drama gives us a lot of inspiration. There are many new attempts in it, and each attempt can be understood as an artistic study. Although this attempt may also have shortcomings, and the entire dance drama still has shortcomings, this spirit of research is precisely what we urgently need today.

    构思巧妙的舞剧“忆当年”
    叶林
    中国人民解放军第二届文艺会演中武汉部队文工团演出的舞剧“忆当年”，只是一出十五分钟左右的短小的舞剧，可是，我觉得它却很有斤两。说实话，近来看过好些新创作的舞剧和舞蹈，印象深的不多，有些看过后也就淡忘了，但是，这个短小的舞剧却令人长久不能忘怀。
    舞剧“忆当年”的情节是在红军博物馆的一幅十八勇士强渡大渡河的巨画面前展开的，络绎不绝的参观者的场面显示出一种和平幸福生活的气氛。这时，一位曾经经历过长征和大渡河战役的将军和他的家属出现了，这位将军站在巨画的面前陷入了沉思，回忆起战斗的当年。顿时，巨画活了，这是将军的遐想，舞台的形象也帮助观众随着将军的回忆飞翔，温习了当年艰苦的战斗，再一次地从这十八个赤胆忠心的无产阶级伟大战士的形象中体会出党的力量和革命殊勋。舞剧的最后，当将军从回忆中转过来的时候，他在巨画的面前继续为参观者们述说着当年的故事……。
    这是一出非常简炼、手法新颖、富于诗的情调、具有丰富的思想内容和艺术感染力的好舞剧。编导者的构思是非常大胆和聪颖的。从主题思想上看，十八勇士强渡大渡河的动人故事早已为我们所熟悉，但是，当时的革命斗争只有和今天的幸福生活相对照的时候，才更能启发人们深思，激发出更大的社会主义建设热情。这个主题被表达得很好，是通过一种巧妙的艺术结构，用它生动的艺术形象来体现的。编导者把事隔二十多年的两个不同的革命历史阶段的事件只勾画几笔就巧妙地结合在一起了，这里面只不过是一幅画、一位曾经是画中人的将军、再加上一些参观红军博物馆的群众而已，我们用不着在舞剧中看出十八勇士强渡大渡河的全部经历，也用不着在舞剧中如何着重地介绍今天的新社会和出场的参观者，甚至也不必着重去介绍这位将军，只不过是通过作为参观者的这位将军的片刻的回忆，就把主题思想刻划得非常鲜明。这种严谨的结构和简练的手法是值得学习的。在这个舞剧中，编导者并没有把话说尽，他还留有余地让观众去思索。舞剧本身是演完了，但舞剧的艺术形象和所展示的带有本质性的主题却继续在观众的思维中活动，引人深思。
    编导者的大胆构思，还表现在那幅强渡大渡河的巨画上，这幅精心设计的，由十八位演员高度艺术化的造型所构成的巨画，是十分成功的，它有很大的艺术感染力，在舞台上乍看起来，活像是一幅杰出的油画，无论从人物性格、表情的深度、色调、画面构图等方面都非常好。但因为它是由真的人构成的，有着活的思想感情和舞台灯光下的那种特殊的艺术魅力，在舞台上产生了一种很动人的艺术气氛。舞剧的核心部分就是靠着这幅巨画和画中英雄在后来的活动中展开的。这种手法看来除了在一些神话题材的戏剧以外，只有在舞蹈中才能够充分发挥。编导者在这方面的思考决不是偶然的，他充分认识到什么样的素材适合什么样的表现形式，注意到舞蹈艺术方法的特点和选择题材的关系，并且，还在舞剧中一再地运用。如，在舞剧的结尾，我们竟看到了两个重叠起来的静止的画面，这就是在十八勇士强渡大渡河的巨画面前，又出现了一个将军继续为参观者们述说着当年战斗故事的画面。这个舞剧就是在这两个重叠的画面中闭幕的。这两个画面给人造成了一种非常突出的印象，尽管它们都是静的，但里面却蕴藏着无限的动。
    也许有人会说，这里面的哑剧成分多了些，舞剧的前部和后部都没有舞蹈。但是，我看是无伤大雅，舞剧本来就是一种用舞蹈和哑剧（表情、造型姿势）的手段来表演的音乐戏剧作品。这个舞剧的哑剧成分虽多，但编导者却采用一种新的方法来处理哑剧，这就是以巨画的造型来作为背景。巨画的造型包含着激烈的动，在这样的造型面前，即使其它演员不舞蹈，也不会觉得这是没有舞蹈的哑剧。
    总之，这个舞剧给我们的启发是很多的，这里面有好些新的尝试，每一种尝试都可以理解为一种艺术上的钻研，尽管这个尝试也可能存在缺点，整个舞剧也还有不足之处，但这种钻研精神正是我们今天所迫切需要的。
