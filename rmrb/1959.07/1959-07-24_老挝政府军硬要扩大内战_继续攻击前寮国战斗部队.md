Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 22nd: The Vietnam News Agency reported today, citing sources from the Vietnam-Laos border, that the troops of the Lao Phoui Sananikone government have recently continued to launch attacks on the Second Battalion of the former Lao Fighting Forces and are carrying out terror and persecution against the Lao people.

    On July 15th, Lao Royal Army troops opened fire on a platoon of the Second Battalion of the former Lao Fighting Forces in Xieng Khouang Province, and the two sides engaged in combat for more than three hours.

    On July 17th, a company of Sananikone government troops fought with the former Lao Fighting Forces 30 kilometers southwest of Phaphom, Xieng Khouang Province.

    On July 18th, Sananikone government troops launched an attack on a unit of the former Lao Fighting Forces in Sam Neua Province but were soon repelled. Three soldiers of the Royal Army were captured.

    In order to expand the civil war, the Sananikone government is currently stepping up the recruitment of conscripts to organize "People's Defense Forces," and is also accelerating the construction of a highway from Xepon to South Vietnam.

    After recognizing the conspiracy of the United States and the pro-American clique within the Sananikone government to undermine Laos' peace, neutrality, independence, and democracy, the people of Laos in various regions are actively supporting the former Lao Fighting Forces. Many young people in Xieng Khouang Province have voluntarily joined the Second Battalion to oppose the Sananikone government's policy of expanding the civil war and suppressing the people through terror.

    It is reported that many officers and soldiers in the Royal Army are unwilling to participate in the fratricidal civil war.

    老挝政府军硬要扩大内战
    继续攻击前寮国战斗部队
    新华社河内22日电　越南通讯社今天据来自越老边境的消息报道：老挝培·萨纳尼空政府的军队最近一个时期以来继续对前寮国战斗部队第二营发动进攻，并且对老挝人民进行恐怖迫害。
    7月15日，老挝王国军队在川圹省对前寮国战斗部队第二营的一个班开火，双方进行了三个多小时的战斗。
    7月17日，萨纳尼空政府的军队一个连同前寮国战斗部队在川圹省法本西南三十公里的地方进行了战斗。
    7月18日，萨纳尼空政府的军队在桑怒省对前寮国战斗部队的一支部队发动进攻，但是不久即被击退。王国军队的三名士兵被俘。
    萨纳尼空政府为了扩大内战，目前正在加紧抓壮丁组织“民卫军”，同时正在加紧修筑从车帮通往南越的公路。
    老挝各地人民在认清了美国和萨纳尼空政府中的亲美集团破坏老挝和平、中立、独立、民主的阴谋以后，都积极支持前寮国战斗部队。川圹省的许多青年已经自动加入第二营，来反对萨纳尼空政府推行的扩大内战和镇压人民的恐怖政策。
    据报道，王国军队中的许多官兵不愿意参加骨肉相残的内战。
