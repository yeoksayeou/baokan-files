The Gannan region of Jiangxi is actively producing straw mushrooms. According to statistics from six areas including Xinfeng and Ganxian, 25,685 straw bundles (straw mushroom beds) have been piled up. On most of the "straw mushroom beds," robust and tender fresh mushrooms have already grown.

In the past, the production scope of straw mushrooms here was not wide, with more cultivation only in Xinfeng, Dayu, and other places. In order to develop local specialties and supply market needs, last year the Gannan Commercial Office held a short-term training class in Xinfeng. It also disseminated straw mushroom production techniques through on-site observation and experience exchange. This year, Dayu, Xingguo, Ruijin and other counties have also established straw mushroom experimental fields or formed technical mobile guidance groups to promote straw mushroom production.

Another dispatch: The Edible Fungus Cultivation Factory attached to the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Commerce uses horse manure, gypsum powder, superphosphate of lime, rice straw, and other raw materials to cultivate a delicious and large white mushroom.

The factory plans to cultivate more than 13,000 square meters of this white mushroom this year, and it is estimated that 20,000 to 25,000 jin of mushrooms can be produced to supply the market.

This newspaper reports: More than one hundred new straw mushroom production bases have been built in various communes in Mengshan County, Guangxi. Currently, a large number of straw mushrooms have grown in forty of the bases. One base in the Datang Brigade of the Dongfeng Commune produces more than 90 jin of straw mushrooms per day. Calculated at this production rate, the county's straw mushroom bases can produce more than 900,000 jin of straw mushrooms, worth more than 224,000 yuan.

Straw mushrooms have a delicious taste and a wide sales market. Producing straw mushrooms requires little investment, saves labor, and generates high and quick income. Therefore, since the straw mushroom production technology was introduced from Pingnan this spring, it has been immediately promoted throughout Mengshan County. Mengshan currently has made some improvements in straw mushroom cultivation technology, shortening the cultivation time from thirty days to fifteen days, and increasing the mushroom yield from 100 jin per 100 jin of rice straw to 150 jin.

### “草菇娘”上鲜菇嫩

    “草菇娘”上鲜菇嫩
    本报讯　江西赣南地区正在积极生产草菇。根据信丰、赣县等六个地区的统计，现已堆了稻草二万五千六百八十五支（草菇娘）。绝大部分“草菇娘”上，已生长出壮嫩的鲜菇。
    过去这里的草菇的生产范围不广，仅信丰、大余等地培植较多。为了发展当地的名产和供应市场需要，去年赣南商业处在信丰召开了短期训练班，还通过现场观摩，经验交流，传播了草菇生产技术。今年，大余、兴国、瑞金等县还搞了草菇试验田或组成技术巡回辅导组，来推动草菇生产。
    又讯　江西省商业厅附属食用菌培植厂，利用马粪、石膏粉、过磷酸钙、稻草等为原料，培育出一种鲜美肥大的白蘑菇。
    这个厂计划今年栽培这种白蘑一万三千多平方公尺，预计可产二万到二万五千斤蘑菇供应市场。
    本报讯　广西蒙山县各公社新建草菇生产基地一百多个，目前已有四十个基地生出大量草菇。东风公社大塘大队的一个基地，日产草菇九十多斤。按这样的生产率计算，全县草菇基地可生产出草菇九十多万斤，价值二十二万四千多元。
    草菇味道鲜美，销路广阔。生产草菇，投资少、省劳力，收入大、收入快，因此，自从今年春天，生产草菇技术从平南传入，立即在蒙山全县推广。蒙山目前培植草菇的技术，已有了一些改进，使培植时间由三十天缩短为十五天，由每百斤稻草产菇一百斤提高到一百五十斤。
