Our correspondent from Ganzhou, July 27th: The People's Commune is accumulating more and more experience in organizing and leading production. The example of the Shashi People's Commune in Gan County, Jiangxi Province, completing the summer harvest and planting tasks quickly and well once again vividly illustrates this point.

Due to the promotion of close planting of early rice and the expansion of the late rice planting area, the summer harvest and planting tasks of the Shashi People's Commune in Gan County, Jiangxi Province, this year have doubled compared to last year. However, last year's rush harvest and planting lasted for a month, while this year the entire commune finished the summer harvest and planting in sixteen days. All members of the Shashi People's Commune believe that the fast progress and high quality of this year's summer harvest and planting are brought about by the People's Commune.

Early and sufficient preparation is a prominent feature of the Shashi People's Commune's leadership in the summer harvest and planting. In the past, preparations for harvesting were generally made two or three days before the harvest; after the harvest, preparations were made for rush planting. Often, because time was running out, there was a shortage of tools, the teams were disorganized, and work efficiency was low. This year, the commune changed this situation. As early as half a month before the harvest, ideological and material preparations were completed. First, the commune leaders organized commune members to conduct a major debate on how to harvest and plant well, correcting the idea of some commune members that the season was early and they could take their time. On the basis of arming their minds, through everyone's discussion, ten specific measures for good harvesting and planting were formulated, and the whole commune implemented them together. Second, iron, wood, and bamboo craftsmen were organized to add more than 5,000 tools and repair old farm tools and warehouses. Third, the commune strengthened its leadership over the harvesting and planting work. The commune secretary, director, and main responsible cadres went deep into the production teams to specifically lead the harvesting and planting. Five days before the start of harvesting, the commune also conducted a major inspection of the material preparations of each production team, replenishing whatever was missing, so that each production team had all the materials ready. After taking the above measures, the minds of the commune members were armed, and there was leadership, organization, and tools. The teams were not chaotic and there was no shortage of weapons, creating conditions for the smooth completion of the harvesting and planting tasks.

More rational use of labor and organization of collaboration is another significant improvement in the Shashi People's Commune's leadership in production. For example, the division of labor is more clear and detailed than in the past, and the labor organization is more complete. Based on past experience, the commune established harvesting, threshing, plowing, water management, and logistics groups according to the strength of labor and technical expertise, and assigned production tasks to each group by dividing up plots of land, with clear responsibilities. In addition, clear division of labor was also made for minor tasks. For example, the harvesting team was responsible for cutting rice and transporting it to the shore, and the threshing team was responsible for turning and drying the grain and transporting it into the warehouse. Such a scientific division of labor allows each commune member to give full play to their expertise, and every production item is done by someone, with order and efficiency greatly improved. For example, the commune's labor quota is more reasonable than in the past, and it is fully implemented. After comprehensively arranging labor, the commune organized commune members to discuss their opinions on the labor quota, and then formulated the labor quota according to the opinions of the commune members, and then unified implementation after it was approved by the commune members' congress. The labor quota determined in this way satisfied every commune member, and the enthusiasm for production was even greater. They said: "The quota-based remuneration is reasonable, and the more we work, the more energetic we become." The commune further utilized the superiority of unified leadership and hierarchical management, and carried out large-scale collaboration in summer harvesting and planting. In the collaboration, the principle of "equivalent exchange" was adhered to, and the dispatch and arrangement were appropriate, with high work efficiency and good quality of agricultural work, so that teams with heavy tasks could catch up with the progress in time.

Meticulous care for the lives of commune members at all times is another characteristic of the Shashi People's Commune's leadership in the summer harvest and planting. Before the start of harvesting and planting, the commune designated a Party committee secretary and a commune director to be in charge of the commune members' living welfare during the harvesting and planting period; extensive publicity work was carried out to educate commune members not to drink cold water or eat cold food; the commune also comprehensively rectified the busy farming canteens and nurseries, and organized labor to prepare firewood, rice, oil, salt, and vegetables. Some commune members were also given three days off to arrange their housework so that they could participate in harvesting and planting with peace of mind. During the harvesting and planting period, canteen cooks delivered meals, dishes, and tea to the fields. The commune also uniformly stipulated that commune members must sleep for eight hours a day, and pregnant women and women during menstruation should not do heavy work or agricultural work involving water. The commune secretary and director often went deep into the homes of commune members to ask about their well-being and help them solve difficulties in their lives. Because the commune always cared about the lives of commune members, the commune members were very healthy and their production morale was high, and the whole commune almost always had full attendance every day.

### 社员争夸公社好　领导“双抢”有力量  沙石公社胜利结束夏收夏种  进度快　质量高　比往年缩短一半时间

    社员争夸公社好　领导“双抢”有力量
    沙石公社胜利结束夏收夏种
    进度快　质量高　比往年缩短一半时间
    本报赣州27日电　人民公社组织与领导生产的经验越来越丰富，江西赣县沙石人民公社既快又好地完成夏收夏种任务的事例，又一次生动地说明了这一点。
    由于早稻推行了密植和扩大了晚稻播种面积，江西赣县沙石公社今年夏收夏种任务比去年增加了一倍。但是去年抢收抢种为期一个月，今年全社在十六天内就结束了夏收夏种。沙石公社全体社员都认为：今年夏收夏种进度快、质量好是人民公社带来的。
    准备得又早又充分，是沙石公社领导夏收夏种的一个突出特点。过去一般是收割前两三天才做收割准备；收了之后，再做抢种的准备，往往因为时间来不及，临阵缺工具，队伍零乱，工效不高。今年公社改变了这种状况，早在收割前半月就做好了思想和物资准备。首先，公社领导社员开展了怎样收好种好的大辩论，纠正了部分社员认为季节早、可以慢慢来的思想。在武装思想的基础上，通过大家讨论，制订了收好种好的十项具体措施，全社共同执行。其次，组织铁、木、篾工添置了五千多件工具，整修了旧农具和仓库。第三，公社加强了对收种工作的领导，公社书记、主任和主要负责干部都深入生产队，具体领导收种。在开始收割前五天，公社对各生产队对物资准备还进行了一次大检查，发现缺什么就补什么，使个个生产队都把物资准备得一应俱全。采取上述措施之后，武装了社员的思想，有领导、有组织、有工具，临阵队伍不乱、武器不缺，为顺利完成收种任务创造了条件。
    更合理地使用劳力和组织协作，是沙石公社在领导生产上的另一个显著进步。例如，劳力分工比过去更明确、细致，劳动组织更健全。公社根据过去的经验，按照劳力强弱和技术特长，分门别类地成立了收割、晒谷、犁耙、管水、后勤等小组，分组划地段包干生产任务，责任分明。此外，对细小工夫也做了明确分工。如收割组负责割禾、运禾草上岸，晒谷组负责翻晒、运谷进仓。这样科学地分工，每个社员都能发挥自己的特长，并且项项生产有人做，秩序井井有条，因而劳动效率大大提高。又如，公社的劳动定额比过去更加合理了，而且完全落了实。公社在全面安排劳力之后，组织社员深入讨论了对劳动定额的意见，然后根据社员的意见制订劳动定额，再经过社员大会通过后统一执行。这样确定的劳动定额，社员个个满意，生产劲头更大。他们说：“定额计酬合理，我们越干越有劲。”公社更发挥了统一领导分级管理的优越性，开展了夏收夏种的大协作。在协作中坚持了“等价交换”的原则，同时和调度安排得当，工效高、农活质量好，使任务重的队都能及时赶上进度。
    无微不至地时刻关怀社员的生活，是沙石公社领导夏收夏种的又一个特色。收种开始前，公社就指定了一名党委书记、一名社主任专管收种期间社员的生活福利；广泛开展了宣传工作，教育社员不喝冷水，不吃冷食物；公社又全面整顿了农忙食堂和托儿所，组织劳动力准备了柴米油盐和菜蔬。部分社员还放了三天假，让他们安排家务，以便放心参加收种。收种期间，食堂炊事员把饭菜和茶水送到田间。公社并统一规定：社员每天必须睡足八小时，怀孕和月经期妇女不做重活和下水的农活。公社书记、主任都经常深入社员家庭问寒问暖，并帮助社员解决生活上的困难。由于公社时刻关心社员生活，社员身体很健康，生产情绪高涨，全社几乎天天出满勤。　　　（刘光辉）
