    Congratulations on the Tapping of Iron from Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace
    On September 13, 1958, we warmly celebrated the tapping of iron from the No. 1 Blast Furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, our country's second large-scale iron and steel industrial base. Only ten months have passed since then, and we are now celebrating the tapping of iron from the No. 2 Blast Furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, celebrating the addition of another strong new force to our country's iron and steel industry. After this blast furnace is in normal production, the iron produced daily, when converted into steel, can be used to manufacture 100,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows, or 700 dump trucks, or to lay 57 kilometers of railway.
    We celebrate the tapping of iron from Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace not only because of its large scale, but also because of its good construction quality and fast construction speed. Among the 39 projects, after inspection and appraisal, 33 were of excellent quality, 5 were of good quality, and 1 was of qualified quality. While ensuring the quality of the project, the construction progress was faster than that of the No. 1 Blast Furnace. Like the No. 1 Blast Furnace, the No. 2 Blast Furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel is equipped with modern advanced technology, but its volume is larger than that of the No. 1 Blast Furnace. It took a total of fourteen months and twelve days from groundbreaking to the outflow of molten iron for the No. 1 Blast Furnace. The No. 2 Blast Furnace only took four months and twelve days, only a fraction of the time for the No. 1 Blast Furnace. Of course, the No. 1 Blast Furnace was built on wasteland, and everything had to start from scratch. The No. 2 Blast Furnace used existing water supply, power supply, and steam supply projects, so the conditions were more favorable. However, as long as we compare the construction period and quality of the individual projects of the two, we can clearly see that the workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel have achieved high-quality and high-speed construction results with a continuous great leap forward attitude. Similarly, pouring 1,800 cubic meters of foundation concrete, the quality was excellent in both cases, but it took 27 hours for the No. 1 Blast Furnace and only 16 hours for the No. 2 Blast Furnace. Similarly, the quality of the blast furnace bricklaying was also excellent, but it took 25 days for the No. 1 Blast Furnace and only 12 days and 25 minutes for the No. 2 Blast Furnace.
    The tapping of iron from the No. 2 Blast Furnace shows that, under the illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, the enthusiasm for building a better life, which is hidden in the hearts of more than 600 million people, will exert a tremendous force once it is transformed into revolutionary drive. Under the leadership of the Party, the workers who built Wuhan Iron and Steel continuously summed up experience and continuously improved their technology, combining revolutionary drive with the spirit of scientific analysis, with both vigorous mass movements and a down-to-earth style of strictly abiding by technical operating procedures; coupled with the direct assistance of Soviet experts, which enabled us to master superb technology. This is the reason why we can ensure a faster speed on the basis of high quality in construction.
    The cause of socialist construction is advancing, and the talents for socialist construction are growing. Our construction experience is becoming richer day by day, and our understanding of the laws of construction is becoming more comprehensive and profound day by day. We will surely be able to rapidly develop our country's industry and agriculture. Congratulations on the tapping of iron from Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace. Let us wait for the good news of blast furnace production that will be coming soon.

    祝贺武钢二号高炉出铁
    1958年9月13日，我们热烈庆祝过我国第二个大型钢铁工业基地——武汉钢铁公司的一号高炉出铁。从那时到现在，只不过十个月，我们又来庆祝武汉钢铁公司二号高炉出铁，庆祝我国钢铁工业又增加了一个强大的生力军。这个高炉正常生产后，每天生产的铁炼成钢，可以制造十万部双轮双铧犁，或者可以制造七百辆翻斗汽车，可以铺五十七公里铁路。
    我们庆祝武钢二号高炉出铁，不只是因为它的规模大，而且因为它的工程质量好，建设速度快。在三十九项工程中，经过检验鉴定，质量优等的有三十三项，质量良好的有五项，质量合格的有一项。在保证工程质量的条件下，工程进度比一号高炉快。武钢二号高炉跟一号高炉一样，都是用现代先进技术装备起来的，但容积比一号高炉大。一号高炉从破土动工到流出铁水，一共用了十四个月零十二天，二号高炉只用了四个月零十二天，只有一号高炉的零头。当然，一号高炉是在荒地上建设起来的，一切都得从头来，二号高炉利用了现成的送水、送电、送汽等工程，条件是较为优越的，但是，只要我们比较一下两者单项工程的建设期限和质量情况、就能明显地看出武钢职工是以继续大跃进的姿态取得了优质高速的建设成绩。同样是浇灌一千八百立米的基础混凝土，质量都是优等，一号高炉是二十七个小时，二号高炉只用了十六小时。同样的高炉砌砖，质量也都是优等，一号高炉用了二十五天，二号高炉只用十二天零二十五分钟。
    二号高炉出铁，表明在党的建设社会主义总路线照耀下，蕴藏在六亿多人民心里的建设自己美好生活的热情，一旦把它变成了革命的干劲，会发挥多么巨大的力量。建设武钢的职工，在党的领导下，不断地总结经验，不断地提高技术，把革命干劲和科学的分析精神结合起来，既有轰轰烈烈的群众运动，又有踏踏实实的严格遵守技术规程的作风；加上苏联专家的直接帮助，使我们掌握了精湛的技术。这就是我们在建设中能够保证在优质的基础上又达到较快速度的原因。
    社会主义建设事业在前进，社会主义建设的人才在成长。我们的建设经验在一天天地丰富，我们对建设规律的认识在一天天地全面和深刻。我们一定能迅速地发展我国的工业和农业。祝贺武钢二号高炉出铁。让我们等待着不久即将传来的高炉生产的捷音。
