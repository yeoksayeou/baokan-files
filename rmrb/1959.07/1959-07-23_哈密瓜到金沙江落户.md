	Hami Melon Takes Root in the Jinsha River
	By our reporter Zhang Jiechun
	One clear and breezy afternoon, we followed the hillside, passed through patches of clouds and mist, and arrived at the Jinsha River valley. The land here is truly delightful. The leaves of corn, rice, vegetables, and sugarcane are all lush green, watermelons are as big as winter melons, and white-skinned cucumbers are almost as thick as an armful. It's also unbelievable to see "Hami melons" here!
	According to the farm manager, they have been growing Hami melons for two years and have had bumper harvests each time. When the melons ripen, you can smell their fragrance from a long distance away from the melon field. Just putting one in the house fills the room with fragrance, so everyone simply calls them "fragrant melons."
	They started planting them in this way. At the end of 1957, the farm received instructions from higher authorities to grow more fruits and vegetables to support the Dongchuan mining area. Everyone came up with ideas, talking about vegetables, beans, and then fruits and melons. When melons were mentioned, naturally Hami melons were brought up, but it was uncertain whether they could be grown successfully. The farm manager, being a person who dared to try new things, immediately sent 100 yuan to the Hami Prefecture Farm in Xinjiang, asking them to help with the seed problem.
	In February 1958, the money was returned, but the melon seeds also arrived; attached was a letter giving a concise introduction to various matters that should be paid attention to from soil and sowing to melon ripening.
	Such an introduction, for a letter, could be considered detailed; but for people who had never even seen a Hami melon, it was not enough. For example, the Hami melon seeds are pointed at both ends, which end is the stem? That was the question.
	So the farm manager organized a ten-person melon planting team, studying together at night and trying out different planting methods during the day. They found books on growing watermelons, and based on local conditions, and with reference to the introduction from the Hami Prefecture Farm, they pondered and pondered, finally changing from having no confidence to having great confidence. According to the Hami Prefecture Farm, the Hami melon sowing period is generally at the end of April or the beginning of May to avoid frost damage to the seedlings; after flowering and fruiting, the melon fields cannot be irrigated. The Jinsha River valley basically does not have frost, so they sowed earlier, so that the melons could mature before the rainy season. According to the letter, the melon vines should be topped when they grow to seven nodes. Based on the actual growth, they felt that topping at seven nodes would result in too few melons, so they changed it to fourteen nodes. In this way, one vine is left per plant, which can produce about ten melons.
	In the process of cultivation, they also encountered various "small snags". However, after encountering them, they gained experience. Insect pests are the great enemy of Hami melons, and from the time of germination, they are threatened by various pests. How to treat them? You can't use 666. As soon as 666 is sprayed on the melon leaves, they immediately secrete yellow water droplets and die within two or three days. Wood ash can prevent insects, but it can be blown away by the wind. What to do? They caught the insects by hand. Hami melons are very sensitive to soap; touching them with hands that have just been washed with soap will cause them to rot. So their melon fields are not open to everyone to enter casually.
	In this way, they successfully grew every piece of melon. Good yields were 8,000 jin per mu, and even the lower yields were more than 4,000 jin, which is higher than watermelon yields. As for the taste? Everyone has their own opinion: some say it is lighter than the melons produced in Hami; others say this taste is also very delicious and has a unique flavor.

### 哈密瓜到金沙江落户

    哈密瓜到金沙江落户
    本报记者　章皆淳
    一个风清云淡的下午，我们顺着山坡，穿过一片片的云雾，来到了金沙江河谷。这里的土地真是喜人，包谷、水稻、蔬菜、甘蔗的叶子都是绿油油的，西瓜大得像冬瓜，白皮黄瓜几乎有一捧粗。在这里还令人难以置信的看到了“哈密瓜”！
    据农场场长说：他们种植哈密瓜已有两年了，都获得了丰收。瓜熟时，离瓜田老远就闻到瓜香，房子里搁上一个也是满室香气，因此大家干脆叫它“香瓜”。
    他们是这样种植起来的。1957年底，农场得到上级指示，叫多种瓜果蔬菜，支援东川矿区。大家就想开了主意，谈了蔬菜、谈豆类，谈了豆类、谈瓜果。一谈到瓜，自然不能不谈哈密瓜，只是不知种得成种不成。场长是个勇于尝试的人，立即给新疆哈密专区农场汇了一百元钱，请他们帮助解决种子问题。
    1958年2月，钱寄回来了，不过瓜子也来了；还附了一封信，从土壤、播种直到瓜熟应注意的各种事项，都作了扼要的介绍。
    这样一个介绍，作为一封信来说，已经算是详细的了；但对于连哈密瓜都没见过的人来说，还不很够。譬如说：哈密瓜子两头都是尖尖的，究竟那一头是蒂？这就是个问题。
    于是场长就组织了一个十人种瓜小组，晚上一道研究，白天分头试种。他们找来了种西瓜的书，根据当地的情况，再参照着哈密专区农场的介绍，琢磨来琢磨去，终于从毫无把握变为大有把握。据哈密专区农场介绍，哈密瓜播种期间一般在4月底5月初，以免幼苗遭到霜害；在开花结果后，瓜塘是不能灌水的。金沙江河谷根本不下霜，他们就提前播种，使瓜能在雨季到来前成熟。据来信介绍，瓜秧长到七节就打尖。他们根据实际生长情况，认为七节打尖结瓜太少，改为十四节。这样每株留一根蔓，共可结十来个。
    在栽培过程中，也碰到过各种“小钉子”。不过碰了一下，也就得出经验来了。虫害是哈密瓜的大敌，从发芽时起，一直受着各种害虫的威胁。怎么治？不能用六六六。瓜叶上只要打上六六六，马上就吐黄水珠，两三天就死掉。柴灰可以防虫，可又要被风刮跑。怎么办？他们就用手捉虫。哈密瓜很怕肥皂，刚洗了肥皂的手摸一摸就烂。所以他们的瓜田是不让人家随便进去的。
    就这样，他们每一块瓜都种成功了。好的每亩收到八千斤，差的也收到四千多斤，产量比西瓜还高。至于味道如何？各有各的说法：有的说比哈密出的瓜要淡一些；有的说这种味道也很好吃，别有风味。
