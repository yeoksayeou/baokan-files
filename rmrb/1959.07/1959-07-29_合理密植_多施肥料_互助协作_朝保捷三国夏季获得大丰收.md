Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang - Unusual large-scale wheat bumper harvests have appeared in various parts of Korea this year.

According to a report in "Democratic Korea" on the 25th, the 128.5 chongbo (one chongbo equals 15 mu) of wheat planted by the Chollima Agricultural Cooperative in Hwangju County, North Hwanghae Province, has been 70% harvested, with an estimated average yield of 4.6 tons per chongbo. Among them, the two chongbo experimental plot with the best growth can yield up to 12 tons per chongbo. This is an unprecedented bumper harvest record for wheat planting here; in the past, the average yield of wheat here was only about 1.6 tons per chongbo.

The reason why Korean farmers have achieved large-scale wheat bumper harvests is that they have implemented the planting methods of deep plowing, close planting, and heavy fertilization proposed by the Korean Workers' Party. The members of the aforementioned Chollima Agricultural Cooperative universally deep-plowed the wheat fields 30 centimeters before planting wheat last autumn, doubling the depth compared to previous years. Reasonable close planting was implemented during sowing, with 180 kilograms of seeds sown per chongbo. In addition, more than 30 tons of compost were applied per chongbo of wheat field, twice as much as in previous years. Since this agricultural cooperative built irrigation networks on all land before the end of last year, it was able to water the wheat fields in a timely manner this spring, thus ensuring this year's bumper harvest.

Sofia dispatch from this newspaper on the 28th - According to estimates by the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Bulgaria's wheat, sunflowers, corn, sugar beets, tobacco, and other crops will achieve unprecedented bumper harvests this year.

Although the harvest work started eight days later than last year due to unfavorable weather conditions in the spring and early summer, by July 23, the national summer harvest work had been 82.8% completed, of which the wheat harvest had been 86.2% completed. 87.8% of the harvesting work was completed by machines, and 53.4% of the harvested crops had been threshed.

According to this year's plan, each decare (one decare equals 1.5 mu) of land should yield 180 kilograms of wheat. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, this plan can not only be completed, but in some areas, the yield per unit area of wheat will be higher than this standard.

The main reason for the estimated bumper harvest this year is the greatly increased application of natural and chemical fertilizers compared to previous years.

Another reason is that reasonable close planting has been achieved this year. For example, the average planting density of corn was 2,000 seeds per decare last year, while this year it is more than 3,000 seeds.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 25th - A joyful scene of bumper harvests is currently unfolding in the Czechoslovakian countryside. Farmers are working day and night in tense summer harvesting under the slogan of "striving to complete the wheat harvest without loss in fourteen to eighteen days."

So far, the rapeseed harvesting has been fully completed nationwide, and the wheat harvesting is entering its climax. On the cultivated land owned by cooperatives nationwide, the harvesting of grass fodder has been completed.

Since the beginning of this year's summer harvest, good news of high yields has been constantly pouring in from various places. For example, an agricultural production cooperative in Slovakia harvested 45.8 quintals per hectare on 19 hectares of winter barley, more than double the average yield last year.

Based on the current situation, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry predicts that this year will be a bumper harvest year, and the harvest of wheat crops will increase by 15% compared to last year.

During the summer harvest, extensive mutual assistance and cooperation have been carried out between various cooperatives and between urban and rural working people. Large numbers of workers, students, soldiers, and staff have gone to the countryside to help with the harvest. Many factories have also proposed guarantees to supply cooperatives with sufficient machine parts during the summer harvest.

The Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government attach great importance and care to this year's summer harvest, and party organizations and people's committees at all levels have strengthened specific leadership over the summer harvest work. Many party organizations and people's committee staff have gone deep into the countryside to help farmers formulate summer harvest plans. Many cooperatives have also established busy season nurseries and temporary public canteens with the help of the people's committees, so that more female labor can participate in the summer harvest.

### 合理密植　多施肥料　互助协作  朝保捷三国夏季获得大丰收

    合理密植　多施肥料　互助协作
    朝保捷三国夏季获得大丰收
    据新华社平壤电　朝鲜各地今年出现了往年所罕见的小麦大面积丰产纪录。
    据“民主朝鲜报”25日报道，黄海北道黄州郡千里马农业社所种植的一二八·五町步（每町步合十五市亩）小麦，已收打了70％，估计平均每町步产量达四·六吨。其中长得最好的两町步试验田，每町步的产量可达十二吨。这是这里种植小麦前所未有的丰产纪录，过去这里的小麦平均每町步的产量只有一·六吨左右。
    朝鲜农民取得小麦大面积丰产的原因，是由于他们实行了朝鲜劳动党提出的深耕、密植、多施肥料的种作方法的结果。上述千里马农业社的社员在去秋种小麦以前，在小麦田上普遍深耕了三十公分，比往年加深了一倍。播种时实行合理密植，每町步播下了一百八十公斤种籽。另外，在每町步麦田上施了三十多吨堆肥，比往年多一倍。由于这个农业社在去年年底以前就在所有的土地上修了灌溉网，今年春季及时地给小麦田浇了水，因而保证了今年的大丰收。
    本报索非亚28日电　据保加利亚农林部估计，今年保加利亚的小麦、向日葵、玉蜀黍、甜菜、烟草和其他作物都将获得空前大丰收。
    尽管由于今年春天和夏初的气候条件不好，收割工作比去年迟开始了八天，但是到7月23日为止，全国夏收工作已完成了82.8％，其中小麦的收割完成了86.2％。87.8％的收割工作是用机器来完成的，所收进来的作物已有53.4％。进行了脱粒工作。
    根据今年的计划，每一狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一点五市亩）的土地要收获一百八十公斤的小麦。据农林部估计，这个计划不但可以完成，而且在某些地区，小麦的单位面积产量还会比这个标准要高。
    今年估计能够取得大丰收的主要原因是，所施的天然肥料和化学肥料比往年大大增多。
    另一个原因是，今年作到了合理密植。例如，去年玉蜀黍播种密度平均一狄卡尔为二千颗种子，今年则为三千颗以上。
    新华社布拉格25日电　目前捷克斯洛伐克农村中呈现着一片丰收的欢乐景象。农民们正在“争取十四天到十八天内无损失地完成麦收”的口号下，日夜紧张地进行着夏收。
    到目前为止，全国油菜的收割工作已全部完成，麦类收割正进入高潮。在全国合作社拥有的耕地上，草类饲料的收割已经完成。
    自今年夏收开始以来，各地不断传来高产的喜报。例如，斯洛伐克的一个农业生产合作社在十九公顷的冬大麦田上每公顷收获四十五点八公担，比去年平均产量高出一倍多。
    根据目前情况，捷克斯洛伐克农林部预计今年将是一个丰收年，麦类作物的收成将比去年增加15％。
    在夏收中，各合作社之间以及城乡劳动人民之间开展了广泛的互助和协作。成批的工人、学生、战士和职员等都到农村帮助收割。许多工厂并提出保证，在夏收期间要供给合作社足够的机器零件。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府对今年的夏收给予极大的重视和关怀，各级党组织和人民委员会都加强对夏收工作的具体领导。许多党组织和人民委员会的工作人员都深入农村，帮助农民制定夏收计划。很多合作社还在人民委员会的帮助下建立了农忙托儿所和临时公共食堂等，以便使更多的妇女劳动力能参加夏收。
