    Reported by this newspaper: After the Pakistani government announced in mid-June that it would move its capital from Karachi to an area near Rawalpindi in West Pakistan, various parties speculated about the reasons for this decision by the Pakistani government. At a press conference given by Pakistani Commerce Minister Batto on July 11, a reporter asked: It is said that a naval base for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization or the Baghdad Pact will be built in Karachi, and the income from this base will be one of the sources of funding for the construction of Pakistan's new capital, Rawalpindi. The reporter asked if this statement was correct.

    In answering this question, Batto said, "I think this is speculation. It (the base) may be built, or it may not. But this cannot be a source of funding for the construction of the capital."

    However, he stated that Karachi would not become a free port. He said that the government might declare a specific area of Karachi as a "free trade zone."

    According to a report in the "Dawn" on July 14, a runway more than 10,000 feet long will be built at Karachi Airport for heavy jet aircraft. The U.S. Development Loan Fund has provided funding for this project, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed the preliminary construction work on the runway.

    卡拉奇的前途：军事基地？自由港？
    本报讯　巴基斯坦政府在6月中旬宣布将把它的首都从卡拉奇迁往西巴基斯坦的拉瓦尔品第附近的地区后，各方面对巴基斯坦政府这一决定的原因有所推猜。在7月11日巴基斯坦商业部长巴托的记者招待会上，有记者提出这样的问题：据说在卡拉奇将要建筑一个东南亚条约组织或者巴格达条约的海军基地，而从这个基地所得到的收入将是用来建设巴基斯坦新首都拉瓦尔品第的经费来源之一，记者问这种说法是否正确。
    巴托在回答这个问题时说，“我想这是一种猜测。它（基地）可能建立，也可能不建立。但是这不能成为为建设首都寻找经费的来源”。
    但是他表示，卡拉奇将不会成为一个自由港。他说，政府可能宣布把卡拉奇的一个特定地区作为“自由贸易区”。
    又据7月14日“黎明报”报道，卡拉奇飞机场将建筑一条可供重型喷气式飞机使用的长一万多英尺的跑道。美国开发贷款基金已为这一工程提供基金，美国工程兵团完成了跑道工程的初步建设工作。
