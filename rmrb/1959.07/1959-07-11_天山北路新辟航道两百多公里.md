Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 8th - After dredging, the Ertix River, located on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, has had its navigable channel extended upstream by 73 kilometers, reaching the vicinity of Buluntuo Sea, east of Burqin County. With this extension, the total navigable distance of the Ertix River within China now reaches over 230 kilometers. The "Xinjiang No. 2" tugboat, towing two newly built 50-ton barges, is currently operating on the newly opened waterway east of Burqin County and is continuing to test the waters further upstream.

A 120-horsepower tugboat, the "Xinjiang No. 1," was recently launched near the Gongnais Stud Farm, upstream of the Ili River, another major river in Xinjiang. It will be testing the waters upstream from here to the newly built Xinyuan Iron and Steel Plant in the grasslands, a total distance of over 130 kilometers. Currently, a small shipyard is under construction in Yining City on the banks of the Ili River. Once completed, it will manufacture cargo barges with a capacity of up to 300 tons and tugboats with a power of up to 270 horsepower.

    天山北路新辟航道两百多公里
    新华社乌鲁木齐8日电  新疆天山以北的额尔齐斯河经过整治以后，航道已经向上游延伸了七十三公里，到达布尔津县以东的布伦托海附近。至此，额尔齐斯河在我国境内的通航里程已有二百三十多公里。“新疆二号”拖轮拖带着新制的两艘载重五十吨的驳船，目前正在往来行驶在布尔津县以东新辟的航道上，并且还继续向上游试航。
    一艘一百二十马力的拖轮“新疆一号”，最近也在新疆另一条大河伊犁河上游的巩乃斯种羊场附近下水了。它将从这里上溯试航到草原上新建的新源钢铁厂附近，全程共一百三十多公里。目前伊犁河畔的伊宁市正在兴建一座小型船舶修造厂，建成以后将制造载重三百吨以下的货驳和二百七十马力以内的拖轮。
