Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 4th: The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council today issued a call to the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committees of all countries and all peace-loving people in the world, urging them to designate July 20th as "Vietnam Day" and to spare no effort in promoting the peaceful reunification of Vietnam.

In a notice sent to the Solidarity Committees of various countries, the Secretariat demanded the withdrawal of US military personnel from South Vietnam, the dismantling of US military bases in South Vietnam, and urged negotiations between North and South Vietnam before holding free general elections. The notice also called on the South Vietnamese authorities to fully cooperate with the International Commission for Vietnam, to immediately cease all acts of persecution against the people, and to abolish all fascist laws in South Vietnam.

The notice accused the United States of violating its promises made at the 1954 Geneva Conference. The notice stated that as a participant in the Geneva Conference, the United States had promised to respect these agreements; however, unfortunately, on the day the Geneva Accords were signed, US President Eisenhower announced in Washington that his government was not bound by the agreements.

The notice pointed out that despite these agreements, South Vietnam, with the help of its American masters, now possesses military aircraft, numerous army, air force, and naval bases, and an armed force of over 450,000 people, while the population of South Vietnam is only twelve million. Most of the senior officers of this army are trained in the United States. Obviously, the American imperialists intend not only to make South Vietnam their economic base, but also to make it a base for aggression against other countries. In this regard, the notice cited former US Secretary of State Dulles' statement in Manila in 1955 that "the United States is engaged in activities against China on three fronts: Taiwan, Korea, and Indochina."

Referring to the armed attacks launched by the Kingdom of Laos government against the former Pathet Lao fighting forces under the direction of the American imperialists, the notice stated that such attacks violated the Geneva Accords and were aimed at provoking a war.

The notice stated that, in fact, through these forces, the imperialists, with the help of the Chiang Kai-shek and Ngo Dinh Diem cliques, are conducting armed provocations on the borders of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China. The notice listed examples of the terrorist persecution of patriots by the South Vietnamese authorities. It said that the determination of the Afro-Asian people and all peace-loving people in the world to ensure the full implementation of the Geneva Accords has driven the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and their American masters even more insane. This is the reason for their unprecedented criminal activities in South Vietnam.

The notice concluded by saying that these criminal activities, like adding fuel to the fire, are making the people increasingly indignant, and even millions of residents in South Vietnam are calling for the fulfillment of the Geneva Accords.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 4th: Pham Ngoc Thuan, Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the German Democratic Republic, today condemned the US plot to sabotage the Geneva Accords and turn South Vietnam into a base for its aggression in Southeast Asia at a press conference.

Pham Ngoc Thuan cited many facts to show that the United States is constantly undermining the Geneva Accords by transporting weapons to South Vietnam, building military airfields, and sending military advisors.

He said that representatives of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization frequently visit South Vietnam, and South Vietnam also participates in the organization's military exercises.

Pham Ngoc Thuan pointed out that, with US support, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is pursuing a policy of armed war preparations. South Vietnam has become a police state, and the current number of police, gendarmes, and reservists has reached 450,000. 60% of South Vietnam's budget is used for military spending. The people of South Vietnam are living under a reign of terror. South Vietnam recently launched three major arrests and poisoned political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp.

Pham Ngoc Thuan then condemned the United States for controlling Laos and trying to make Laos a base for anti-communism.

Pham Ngoc Thuan said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as a participant in the Geneva Accords, has a responsibility for the situation in Laos and opposes the US plot in the whole of Indochina.

    亚非人民团结理事会书记处号召举行“越南日”
    要求美军撤出南越　实现越南和平统一
    新华社开罗4日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天向各国的亚非团结委员会以及世界上一切爱好和平的人民发出号召，要求把7月20日作为“越南日”，并且不遗余力地促使实现越南的和平统一。
    书记处在向各国团结委员会发出的通知中，要求美国军事人员从南越撤退，撤销美国在南越的军事基地，并且要求促使越南北南两方在进行自由普选以前举行谈判。通知还要求南越当局同越南国际委员会充分进行合作，立即停止对人民进行的一切迫害行动，并且取消南越的所有法西斯法律。
    通知指责美国违背它在1954年日内瓦会议上所作的诺言。通知说，作为日内瓦会议的一个参加国，美国曾经答应尊重这些协议；但是，不幸得很，在日内瓦协议签字的那一天，美国总统艾森豪威尔就在华盛顿宣布，他的政府不受协议的约束。
    通知指出，尽管签订了这些协议，南越在它的美国主子的帮助下，现在拥有军用飞机，很多陆军、空军和海军的基地以及一支人数超过四十五万人的武装部队，而南越的人口却只有一千二百万。这支军队的大多数高级军官是在美国接受训练的。显然，美帝国主义者不仅打算使南越成为他们的经济基地，而且还要使它成为对其他国家进行侵略的基地。在这方面，通知援引前美国国务卿杜勒斯1955年在马尼拉发表的谈话说，“美国在台湾、朝鲜和印度支那这三个阵线上进行反对中国的活动。”
    通知在谈到老挝王国政府在美帝国主义者的指使下对前寮国战斗部队发动的武装进攻时说，这种进攻违反了日内瓦协议，其目的在于挑起一场战争。
    通知说，实际上，通过这些势力，帝国主义者在蒋介石和吴庭艳集团的帮助下，正在对越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国的边境进行武装挑衅。通知列举了南越当局对爱国者进行的恐怖迫害的事例。它说，亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民要求日内瓦协议贯彻到底的决心使吴庭艳集团和他们的美国主子变得更为疯狂起来。这就是他们在南越进行空前的罪恶活动的原因。
    通知最后说，但是，这些罪恶活动就像火上添油一般使人民越来越感到愤慨，甚至南越的千千万万的居民也发出了要求履行日内瓦协议的呼声。
    新华社柏林4日电　越南民主共和国驻德意志民主共和国大使范玉纯今天在记者招待会上谴责美国破坏日内瓦协议，把南越变为它侵略东南亚的基地的阴谋。
    范玉纯列举许多事实说明，美国不断破坏日内瓦协议，向南越运送武器，修筑军用机场，派遣军事顾问。
    他说，东南亚条约组织的代表经常到南越，南越也参加这个组织的军事演习。
    范玉纯指出，在美国支持下，吴庭艳集团正在奉行武装备战政策。南越已成为一个警察国家，目前警察、宪兵、后备兵的数目已达四十五万人。南越预算的60％用于军事开支。南越人民正处于恐怖的统治下。最近南越曾经发动三次大逮捕。并在富利集中营毒杀政治犯。
    范玉纯接着谴责美国控制老挝，要把老挝做为反共的基地。
    范玉纯说，越南民主共和国作为日内瓦协议的参加者，对老挝局势负有责任，并反对美国在整个印度支那的阴谋活动。（附图片）
