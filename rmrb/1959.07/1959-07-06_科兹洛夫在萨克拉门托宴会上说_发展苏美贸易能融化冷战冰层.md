Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, 5th: According to TASS, First Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, Kozlov, and his entourage, left Washington on the 3rd to visit various parts of the United States. They visited Sacramento, the capital of California, and arrived in San Francisco that afternoon.

Kozlov was welcomed in Sacramento by California Governor Brown. Subsequently, he and his entourage visited the state government offices – the State Capitol Building.

Brown hosted a banquet for Kozlov. At the banquet, Brown said that everyone is well aware that there are differences between the United States and the Soviet Union, but the United States and the Soviet Union should still live together in peace. The two countries should be harmonious and build their relationship on a peaceful basis.

Brown pointed out that Mr. Manning, a representative of California's business community, will soon visit the Soviet Union to discuss trade relations between the two countries in more detail.

In his reply, Kozlov pointed out that trade can melt the ice of the Cold War that has been poisoning U.S.-Soviet relations in recent years. He said, "We strive for peace, for friendship and trade between our two countries."

After visiting Sacramento, Kozlov and his entourage flew to San Francisco.

San Francisco Mayor Christopher welcomed Kozlov at City Hall. He told Kozlov that the United States and the Soviet Union are neighbors and should live together peacefully and maintain good neighborly relations. There is no other way.

Kozlov replied that the Soviet Union and the United States are indeed neighbors. The coasts of the Soviet Union and the coast of California both border the same Pacific Ocean. He expressed hope that the two countries would have good relations to develop mutually beneficial trade and economic ties. He also emphasized that the Soviet people and the government believe that disputes in U.S.-Soviet relations can be resolved peacefully through negotiations.

The Mayor of San Francisco presented Kozlov with souvenirs. Christopher said, "If you return to Russia and advocate holding a high-level meeting in our San Francisco, I would be happy."

Kozlov said: "We advocate holding a high-level meeting. We agree that if such a meeting is to be held, it should be held in your city."

    科兹洛夫在萨克拉门托宴会上说
    发展苏美贸易能融化冷战冰层
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社旧金山消息：苏联部长会议第一副主席科兹洛夫及其随行人员3日离开华盛顿到美国各地访问。他们访问了加利福尼亚州的首府萨克拉门托，并且在当天下午到达旧金山。
    科兹洛夫在萨克拉门托受到加利福尼亚州长布朗的欢迎。随后，他和他的随行人员访问了州政府机关所在地——州议会大厦。
    布朗设宴招待科兹洛夫。布朗在宴会上说，大家都很清楚，美苏两国之间有分歧，但是，美苏两国仍然应该和平相处。两国应当和睦，并且把关系建立在和平的基础上。
    布朗指出，加利福尼亚州的工商界代表马宁很快就要到苏联访问，以便更详细地讨论两国的贸易联系问题。
    科兹洛夫在致答词时指出，贸易能够使最近几年来一直在毒化美苏关系的冷战的冰层融化。他说，我们争取和平，争取我们两国之间的友好和贸易。
    在访问了萨克拉门托之后，科兹洛夫及其随行人员乘飞机到达旧金山。
    旧金山市长克里斯托弗在市政府欢迎科兹洛夫，他对科兹洛夫说，美国和苏联是近邻，应当和平相处，保持睦邻关系，此外就没有别的道路。
    科兹洛夫回答说，苏联同美国的确是邻居。苏联的海岸和加利福尼亚的海岸都濒临同一个太平洋。他表示希望两国之间搞好关系以发展互利的贸易和经济联系。他还着重指出，苏联人民和政府认为，可以采取和平的方式，通过谈判来解决苏美两国关系中的争端。
    旧金山市长向科兹洛夫赠送纪念品。克里斯托弗说：“如果你回到俄国之后，主张在我们的旧金山举行高级会议，我将感到高兴。”
    科兹洛夫说：“我们主张举行高级会议。我们同意，如果要举行这种会议的话，就在你们的城市举行。”
