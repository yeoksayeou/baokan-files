Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 1st. The hundred-mu high-yield wheat plot of the Dongyuting Production Team of the Shangfang People's Commune in Xinle County, Hebei, has achieved large-scale high yield. The entire 100.05 mu high-yield plot of wheat, after actual harvesting, threshing, drying, and cleaning, yielded an average of 1,050.5 jin per mu.

This high-yield plot is one of the experimental fields of the Xinle County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The land in the high-yield plot is red soil in a hilly area. The purpose of the county party committee in planting experimental fields here is to gain high-yield experience to guide large-scale high-yield movements in hilly areas. A portion of this county is comprised of hilly areas.

On the high-yield plot, the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture was conscientiously implemented from planting to harvesting. Before sowing, all the land was deeply ploughed; a large amount of base fertilizer was applied; rational close planting was promoted; and superior varieties such as "Shi Te No. 14," "Bi Ma No. 1," and "Nanda 2419" were widely adopted. In terms of field management, fertilizer was applied five times, and water was irrigated four times. In order to prevent pests and diseases, pesticides were sprayed three times, and weeding and soil loosening were carried out five times in a timely manner. As a result, the wheat generally grew with thick stalks, large ears, and full grains. (Attached picture)

    河北上方公社百亩小麦亩产逾千斤
    树起丘陵区丰产榜样
    新华社石家庄1日电　河北新乐县上方人民公社东玉亭生产队的百亩小麦丰产方，获得了大面积高额丰产。全丰产方一百亩零五分小麦，经实收实打晒干扬净，平均亩产达一千零五十斤半。
    这块丰产方是中共新乐县委的试验田之一。丰产方的土地是丘陵地区的红土地。县委在这里种试验田的目的，是为了取得丰产经验，指导丘陵地区的大面积丰产运动。这个县有一部分地区是丘陵地区。
    在丰产方上，从种到收，认真贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”。播种前，全部土地都实行了深翻；施了大量基肥；推行了合理密植；普遍采用了“石特十四号”、“碧蚂一号”和“南大二四一九”等优良品种。在田间管理方面，共计追了五次肥，浇了四次水；为了防止发生病虫害，喷射了三次农药，并且及时锄麦、划麦五次。因此小麦普遍长得秆粗穗大，籽粒饱满。（附图片）
