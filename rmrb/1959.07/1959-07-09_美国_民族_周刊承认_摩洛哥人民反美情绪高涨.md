    American "Nation" Weekly Admits
    Moroccan People's Anti-American Sentiment is High

    The American "Nation" weekly recently published an article entitled "Morocco's 'Little America'" in which it admitted that anti-American sentiment is high among the Moroccan people, who unanimously demand that American troops get out of Morocco. The article wrote that a column of Moroccan students stopped in front of the American Embassy in Rabat. Embassy personnel were standing on the balconies. The students shouted in Arabic "American bases get out of Morocco! Withdraw! Withdraw!" One Moroccan student leader once waved his arms and angrily questioned the Americans, "Why are you staying here and not leaving? You are in your bases, each base a state within a state, when will you leave?" The article admitted that all Moroccans are united in demanding that American troops get out of Morocco and believe that this demand from the Moroccan people is an "emotional reaction" to decades of colonial rule. The article also admitted that the American military bases in Morocco "bear the indelible mark of colonialism."

    The article said that Moroccans call these American military bases "Little Americas." After describing the living conditions of these bases, the article revealed how the American military insults the dignity of the Moroccan people.

    美国“民族”周刊承认
    摩洛哥人民反美情绪高涨
    美国“民族”周刊在不久以前发表的一篇题为“摩洛哥的‘小美国’”的文章中承认，摩洛哥人民的反美情绪高涨，并且一致要求美国驻军滚出摩洛哥。文章写道，摩洛哥学生的队伍在拉巴特美国大使馆门前停下来。大使馆的人员都站在阳台上。学生们用阿拉伯语高喊“美国基地滚出摩洛哥！撤退！撤退！”有一位摩洛哥学生领袖曾经挥动着手臂愤怒地质问美国人，“你们为什么要留在这里不走？你们在你们的基地上，每一个基地是一个国家中的国家，你们什么时候才走开？”文章承认，所有摩洛哥人在要求美军滚出摩洛哥这一点上是一致的，并且认为摩洛哥人民的这种要求是几十年殖民统治的一种“感情上的反应”。文章还承认，美国在摩洛哥的军事基地“打上了无法抹掉的殖民主义的烙印”。
    文章说，摩洛哥人称这些美军基地是“小美国”。文章描述了这些基地的生活情况后透露了美军如何侮辱摩洛哥人的尊严。
