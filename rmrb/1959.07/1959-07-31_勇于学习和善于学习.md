People who are brave enough to learn all advanced experiences will not be complacent; however, to truly learn advanced experiences, one must also be good at learning. In the past, Shaanxi Province promoted Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience, and many places also launched a craze of "learning from Qiuxiang, catching up with Qiuxiang", but the effect was not as good as this year. This year, more than four million mu of cotton in the province are generally growing well, with budding, flowering, and boll formation generally five or six days earlier than in previous years. The key lies in being good at learning. In the past, learning from Zhang Qiuxiang's experience focused more on methods, such as how many times to fertilize, how many times to water, how many times to cultivate, and the "five-step pruning" method. This year, cotton farmers in various places have paid attention to starting from the specific conditions of their localities in their learning, and flexibly applying Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience according to different soil, climate, varieties, and different farming conditions.

From the situation of learning Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience in various parts of Shaanxi Province this year, it can be seen that they are not only brave enough to learn, but also good at learning; they not only humbly learn from other people's advanced experience, but also learn with analysis, research, and creativity. What is the most valuable thing to learn from Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience? It is her principle of specifically analyzing specific things, proceeding from actual conditions, and adopting different cultivation and management methods according to different times, places, and cotton growth conditions, which is what Zhang Qiuxiang calls "watching the weather, watching the land, and watching the crops." Mastering this principle can be used freely, so as to adapt to the time, place, and conditions, and make full use of favorable factors to promote crop growth.

The women's team led by Liu Yukun and Zhang Chonglan of the Jiangwudian Production Team of the Hancheng Commune in Xi'an City can be said to be an example of being good at learning. This team, in May of this year, based on Zhang Qiuxiang's principle of "watching the weather, watching the land, and watching the crops," combined with the actual conditions of lower local soil temperature and different soil quality than Zhang Qiuxiang's area, adopted specific measures such as increasing the number of cultivations, earthing up in advance, applying more aged wall soil, and appropriately reducing the number of irrigations, so that the cotton seedlings grew strong and uniform. In July, based on the local hot climate and the cotton fields already showing signs of drought, they adopted management methods such as flood irrigation with living water once, so that 180 mu of cotton has been growing very well. The reason why this team can proceed from the actual local conditions and creatively apply Zhang Qiuxiang's experience lies in the fact that they have mastered Zhang Qiuxiang's scientific method of specifically analyzing the situation and adopting different methods according to different situations. That is to say, they not only know Zhang Qiuxiang's experience, but also know their own specific conditions; it is a process of learning Zhang Qiuxiang's advanced experience, and also a process of concretizing and localizing Zhang Qiuxiang's advanced experience. The result of this creative learning is that foreign experience blossoms and bears fruit locally, so that all the cotton fields grow well.

    勇于学习和善于学习
    天青
    勇于学习一切先进经验的人，是不会故步自封的；但是，要真正学到先进经验，还得善于学习。陕西省往年就推广了张秋香的植棉经验，很多地方也掀起了“学秋香、赶秋香”的热潮，但是，效果不如今年好。今年全省四百多万亩棉花普遍生长良好，现蕾、开花、结桃一般都比往年提早五、六天，关键就在善于学习。往年学张秋香的经验，多偏重在方法上，比如施几次肥、浇几次水、中耕几次，以及“五步整枝”等等。今年各地棉农在学习中，都注意到从本地的具体情况出发，根据不同的土壤、气候、品种和不同的耕作条件，灵活地运用张秋香的植棉经验。
    从今年陕西省各地学习张秋香植棉经验的情形可以看出：他们既勇于学习，又善于学习；不仅虚心学习别人的先进经验，还能有分析、有研究、创造性地学习。张秋香的植棉经验最值得学习的东西是什么呢？就是她那种具体地分析具体事物，从实际情况出发，根据不同的天时、地利和棉花生长情况，采取不同的培育管理方法，也就是张秋香所说的“看天、看地、看庄稼”的原则。掌握了这个原则，就可以运用自如，做到因时、因地、因条件制宜，充分利用有利因素，促进作物的生长。
    西安市汉城公社讲武殿生产队刘玉坤、张崇兰领导的妇女队，可说是善于学习的一例。这个队今年5月根据张秋香“看天、看地、看庄稼”的原则，结合本地地温比张秋香那里低、土质又不同的实际情况，采取增加中耕次数、提前培土、多施陈墙土、适当减少灌溉次数等具体措施，使棉苗长得茁壮、整齐。7月，根据当地气候热、棉田已呈旱象的情况，又采取漫灌一次活水等管理方法，使一百八十亩棉花一直生长得很好。这个队所以能够从本地实际情况出发，创造性地运用张秋香的经验，就在于他们掌握了张秋香那种具体地分析情况、根据不同的情况采用不同的办法的科学方法。这就是说，她们既知道张秋香的经验，又知道自己的具体条件；是学习张秋香先进经验的过程，又是使张秋香的先进经验具体化本地化的过程。这种创造性的学习的结果，使外地的经验在本地开花结果，使全部棉田块块生长良好。
