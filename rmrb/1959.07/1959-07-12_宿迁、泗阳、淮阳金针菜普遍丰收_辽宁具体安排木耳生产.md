    Daylily Harvests Universally Bountiful in Suqian, Siyang, and Huaiyang; Liaoning Makes Specific Arrangements for Wood Ear Production

    (Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 11th) Suqian and Siyang counties in Jiangsu Province are vigorously developing daylily (also known as yellow flower vegetable) production to supply the urban population with non-staple food needs. Currently, it is the peak season for daylily harvesting, and commune members are not only busy harvesting and processing but also sending the processed goods to the market.

    Suqian and Siyang counties are the main daylily production areas in Jiangsu. With strong national support and assistance over the past few years, daylily production has greatly developed. Siyang County originally had more than 11,000 mu of daylilies, expanded by more than 3,500 mu last year, and mobilized the masses to expand by more than 3,000 mu this year using "ten-side" vacant land. Suqian County can harvest daylilies on more than 16,000 mu this year. Dingju Commune in this county adopted the method of transplanting seedlings to expand the area by 2,500 mu using "ten-side" gaps. Tongxing and Xianjin brigades of Daxing Commune adopted the "fast seedling dividing method" of cutting less of the rhizome during seedling division and appropriately retaining the original roots and whiskers, breaking the conventional rule of three years to see flowers after transplanting. This year, 80% of the more than 1,000 mu of daylilies transplanted by them have flowered. In the past, Dingju, Daxing, Yanghua, and other communes supplied 600,000 to 700,000 jin of daylilies to urban residents and for export every year.

    The Suqian and Siyang County Committees of the Communist Party of China attach great importance to the leadership of daylily production. In Suqian, each commune in the key production areas has a Party Committee secretary responsible for managing daylily production. In order to strengthen technical guidance on daylily production, Siyang County transferred personnel from commercial and other relevant departments to form a technical guidance group, which went deep into the grassroots to conduct roving inspections and guidance around agricultural production. The two counties also established a field management responsibility system, adopting the "four-determination" method of fixing people, work, output, and quality, assigning tasks to individuals and teams or farms. This year, Suqian County seized the important links of daylily budding, returning to green, and jointing, applying 100 to 150 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer and 50 dan of pig manure per mu, and loosening the soil and weeding two to five times.

    Currently, the commercial departments of the two counties have begun to purchase daylilies, adopting the method of simultaneous purchase, processing, and transportation to timely supply the needs of urban residents for non-staple foods. The commercial department of Suqian County has established three daylily processing plants with more than 100 people in key daylily production areas such as Dingju, Daxing, and Yanghua communes, and has adopted the method of fixed-point and door-to-door purchasing, organizing 130 staff members to set up 43 purchasing points. The daylilies here are processed according to national standards to ensure that the products are yellow in color, large in size, without flowers, without bends, and without mold. As of the 7th of this month, the two counties have purchased more than 50,000 jin of daylilies. This year, in addition to local consumption, the estimated purchase quantity will increase by 40% compared to last year.

    (Our Dispatch from Zhengzhou, 11th) Henan Province's famous specialty, yellow flower vegetable (daylily), has begun to enter the market. Since the beginning of July, in Huaiyang County, the main production area of yellow flower vegetable, commune members have been picking unopened flower buds every morning in the vegetable fields, glittering with golden flowers over thousands of mu. In the past ten days or so, the county has purchased more than 200,000 jin. Henan's yellow flower vegetable has the characteristics of being large, plump, and delicious. Huaiyang County's yellow flower vegetable is even more famous. Huaiyang County's yellow flower vegetable production not only accounts for more than 60% of the province's area, but also has a long history, and vegetable farmers have rich cultivation experience.

    This year, the more than 6,700 mu of yellow flower vegetable in the county are growing well, and the total output is expected to reach more than 800,000 jin. Because yellow flower vegetable production is highly technical, in order to ensure a bumper harvest, the communes in the main vegetable production areas of the county are carefully cultivating the flower fields just like managing grain crops. Many production units have adopted the method of establishing professional teams, implementing task contracts, and quota management in the management of yellow flower vegetable.

    In order to restore and develop yellow flower vegetable production, the Huaiyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China has strengthened its leadership over yellow flower vegetable production. The county plans to expand the area by more than 3,000 mu this year. All of the county's existing 1,143 mu of old flower fields that can be divided into roots will be divided, rooted, and transplanted. (Fang Huang)

    (Our Dispatch from Shenyang, 11th) In order to meet the needs of the market, many areas in Liaoning Province that produce wood ear and mushrooms are making specific arrangements for this production. Cities and counties such as Dalian, Tieling, and Kangping have made plans and arrangements for the production of these special dried vegetables. Kuandian County, which is rich in wood ear, has sent people deep into the wood ear production areas to provide technical guidance and help solve some specific problems in production. Currently, the county has selected more than 200,000 pieces of material for wood ear production, and it is estimated that 20,000 jin of wood ear can be produced this year. The commercial departments of Fengcheng County have signed purchase and sale contracts for more than 10,000 jin of wood ear with various People's Communes.

    According to incomplete statistics, fourteen state-owned forest farms in the province have selected 740 cubic meters of wood ear material and established wood ear farms. Fushun City, which was previously thought not to produce wood ear, has also arranged for this production this year. In May, the Fushun City Agriculture and Forestry Bureau also held an on-site meeting on artificial inoculation of wood ear at the Wendao Forest Farm to promote the development of this production. Counties such as Xiuyan, Huanren, Xinbin, and Suizhong have also carried out key experiments on artificial inoculation of wood ear and have equipped special personnel to provide technical guidance and teach everywhere.

    In addition to adopting the method of "contracting down" to vigorously purchase wood ear, mushrooms, and daylilies, the commercial departments in various parts of Liaoning Province have also appropriately adjusted the purchase prices in accordance with the principle of being conducive to the development of special dried vegetable production.

    宿迁、泗阳、淮阳金针菜普遍丰收
    辽宁具体安排木耳生产
    本报南京11日电　江苏省宿迁、泗阳两县大力发展金针菜（即黄花菜）生产，供应城市人民副食品的需要。目前，正是金针菜收获旺季，社员们一面紧张地采制，一面把已加工好的送上市场。
    宿迁、泗阳两县是江苏金针菜的主要产区，几年来在国家大力支援、扶助下，金针菜的生产有很大发展。泗阳县原有金针菜一万一千多亩，去年扩种了三千五百多亩，今年又发动群众利用“十边”空闲土地，扩种三千多亩。宿迁县今年能采摘的金针菜达到一万六千多亩。这个县的丁咀公社采取移秧分栽利用“十边”隙地扩大了两千五百亩。大兴公社同兴、先进两个大队在分秧时采取少剪坐盘根，适当保持原有根须的“快速分秧法”，打破了历来一年移栽三年见花的常规，他们今年移栽分秧的一千多亩金针菜，80％都见了花。丁咀、大兴、仰化等公社过去每年都有六、七十万斤金针菜供应城市人民和出口。
    中共宿迁县委和泗阳县委很重视金针菜生产的领导。宿迁各个重点产区的公社都有一名党委书记负责管理金针菜生产。泗阳县为了加强对金针菜生产的技术指导，抽调商业等有关部门的人员，组成技术指导小组，深入基层，围绕农业生产，巡回检查和指导。这两县还建立了田间管理责任制度，采取定人、定工、定产、定质的“四定”办法，将任务包到人，定到队或场。宿迁县今年抓住金针菜发芽、返青、拔节等重要的环节，每亩追施了一百担到一百五十担杂肥和五十担猪粪肥，并松土、锄草二至五次。
    目前，这两个县的商业部门已开始收购金针菜。并采取边收、边加工、边运出的办法，及时供应城市人民副食品的需要。宿迁县商业部门在丁咀、大兴、仰化公社等重点产菜地区建立了百人以上的三个金针菜加工厂，并采取定点和登门收购办法，组织一百三十个工作人员，设立了四十三个收购点。这里的金针菜是按照国家规定的标准进行加工的，保证产品色黄、大片、无花、无拐、无霉烂。到本月7日止，这两个县已收购金针菜五万多斤。今年这里的金针菜除本地食用一部分外，估计收购的数量将比去年增长40％。

    本报郑州11日电　河南省著名的特产黄花菜（金针菜）已经开始上市。进入7月以来，在黄花菜主要产地的淮阳县，社员们每天清晨在数千亩金花灿烂的菜田中采摘含苞未放的花蕾。近十天以来，全县已收购二十多万斤。河南省黄花菜有个大、肥壮、味美的特点。淮阳县的黄花菜更为有名。淮阳县黄花菜生产不仅面积占全省60％以上，而且历史悠久，菜农都有丰富的培植经验。
    今年，全县六千七百多亩黄花菜生长很好，总产量预计可以达到八十多万斤，由于黄花菜生产技术性很大，为了保证黄花菜丰收，全县各主要产菜区的公社，都像管理粮食作物一样，精心培育花田。许多生产单位在管理黄花菜中，采取成立专业队，实行任务包干，定额管理的办法。
    为了恢复和发展黄花菜生产，中共淮阳县委加强对黄花菜生产的领导，全县计划今年再扩大面积三千多亩，全县现有一千一百四十三亩能分根的老花田，将全部进行分根移植。（方徨）
    本报沈阳11日电　为了满足市场的需要，辽宁省出产木耳、蘑菇的许多地区，正在具体部署这项生产。旅大、铁岭、康平等市、县，对这些特产干菜生产已作了规划和安排。盛产木耳的宽甸县，曾派人深入木耳产区进行技术指导，并帮助解决了生产中的一些具体问题。目前，全县已选出了二十多万根生产木耳的用材，预计今年可产木耳二万斤。凤城县商业部门已同各人民公社签订了一万多斤木耳的购销合同。
    据不完全统计，全省已有十四个国营林场选出七百四十立方米的木耳用材，分别建立了木耳场。过去认为不出产木耳的抚顺市，今年也安排了这项生产。5月间，抚顺市农林局在温道林场还召开了木耳人工接种现场会议，促进这项生产的发展。岫岩、桓仁、新宾、绥中等县，对木耳人工接种，也作了重点试验，并配备了专人进行技术指导，到各处传授。
    辽宁省各地商业部门，除采取“包下来”的办法，大力收购木耳、蘑菇、黄花菜以外，还根据对发展特产干菜生产有利的原则，适当地调整了收购价格。（孙桂山）
