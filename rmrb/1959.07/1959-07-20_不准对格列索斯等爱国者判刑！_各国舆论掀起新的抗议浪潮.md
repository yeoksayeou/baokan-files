Xinhua News Agency, July 19th -- According to TASS, Moscow, July 18th: The news that Greek Royal Prosecutor General Skordas demanded that Glezos be sentenced to five years in prison and three years of exile, and that other patriots be sentenced to death or heavy sentences, has aroused a new wave of protests from the world public. People and public opinion in various countries strongly condemn this shameless demand.

    The German Committee for the Release of Glezos strongly protested against the prosecutor general's demand in a telegram sent to the President of the Athens Military Tribunal, Polychronopoulos, on the 18th. The committee demanded that all defendants be acquitted. The telegram pointed out that the prosecutor's demand, especially the demand for the death penalty, is a shocking provocation and challenge to world public opinion for peace.
    The Central Council of Bulgarian Trade Unions also sent a protest telegram to the President of the Athens Military Tribunal, stating that the accusation that Glezos and other defendants had committed so-called "espionage" had gone bankrupt in front of the whole world. We firmly protest against the brutal trial and demand that Glezos and other patriots be declared innocent and released immediately.
    The working people of Czechoslovakia have sent tens of thousands of resolutions, letters, and telegrams to the Greek government, expressing their indignation at the illegal trial of Glezos and other Greek patriots.
    The International Federation of Resistance Fighters stated in a statement issued in Vienna that the protest movement must be strengthened to stop the persecution of Glezos and other Greek patriots.
    The Executive Committee of the Soviet International Law Association passed a resolution strongly protesting against the illegal trial of Glezos, an outstanding democratic activist and anti-fascist fighter, and pointed out that this is a serious violation of basic human rights and freedoms.
    A protest letter signed by workers, university teachers, and others published in the Mongolian "Truth Daily" on the 18th pointed out that the Greek authorities are attempting to persecute Glezos, the son of the Greek people, with fascist decrees. We demand freedom for Glezos.
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 18th The International Commission of Jurists organized to study the Glezos trial case issued a communique yesterday stating that "no evidence of espionage was provided during the trial."
    The communique said, "We note that the president of the military tribunal personally stated that the prosecuting authorities even have the right to prosecute thoughts and intentions. In this way, merely advocating a certain political idea, or even just based on assumptions, can constitute treason or espionage."
    The communique pointed out, "In this case, it can be seen that the prosecution under the pretext of espionage is nothing more than to suppress freedom of speech and thought."
    The communique said, "The committee firmly believes that a conviction under these circumstances would seriously violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Roman European Treaty, which the Greek government has signed."

    不准对格列索斯等爱国者判刑！
    各国舆论掀起新的抗议浪潮
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：关于希腊皇家总检察长斯科达斯要求判处格列索斯五年徒刑，三年流放，并且判处其他爱国者死刑和重刑的消息，激起了世界公众的新的抗议浪潮，各国人民和舆论强烈谴责这一无耻要求。
    德国争取释放格列索斯委员会18日在给雅典军事法庭庭长波利赫罗诺普洛斯的电报中强烈抗议总检察长提出的要求。委员会要求宣告所有的被告无罪。电报指出，检察长的要求，特别是关于判处死刑的要求，是对世界和平舆论的骇人听闻的挑衅和挑战。
    保加利亚工会中央理事会也向雅典军事法庭庭长发出了抗议电，电报说，格列索斯和其他被告犯有所谓“间谍罪”的诬告在全世界面前破产了。我们坚决抗议残暴的审讯，并且要求宣布格列索斯和其他爱国者无罪，立即释放他们。
    捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民向希腊政府发出了成千上万的决议、信件和电报，对非法审判格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者表示愤慨。
    国际抵抗运动战士联合会在维也纳发表的声明中指出，必须加强抗议运动，阻止对格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者的迫害。
    苏联国际法学会执行委员会通过了一项决议，坚决抗议对优秀的民主活动家、反法西斯战士格列索斯进行非法审判，并指出这是严重地破坏基本人权和自由的行为。
    蒙古“真理报”18日刊登的包括工人、大学教师等签名的一封抗议信中指出，希腊当局企图以法西斯法令来迫害希腊人民的儿子格列索斯，我们要求给格列索斯自由。
    新华社巴黎18日电　为研究格列索斯审讯案而组织的法学家国际委员会昨天发表公报说，“在审讯过程中，没有提供任何证明间谍活动的证据”。
    公报说，“我们注意到，军事法庭庭长亲自声称，起诉当局甚至有权就思想和意想起诉，这样一来，仅仅是主张某一种政治思想，或者甚至单单凭假设，就可以构成叛国罪或间谍罪。”
    公报指出，“在这种情况下，可以看出，借口间谍活动而提出的起诉，其目的无非是要打击言论和思想自由”。
    公报说，“委员会肯定认为，在这种情况下的定罪，将严重违反希腊政府签了字的世界人权宣言和罗马欧洲条约。”
