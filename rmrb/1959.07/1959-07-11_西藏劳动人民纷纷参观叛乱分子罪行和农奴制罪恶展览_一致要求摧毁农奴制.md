Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 10th. Tens of thousands of farmers and herdsmen in the Lhasa, Shannan, and Qamdo regions of Tibet have visited the exhibitions exposing the crimes of the Tibetan rebels and the evils of the serf system held recently in various places.

The "Exhibition of Criminal Evidence of Instruments of Torture Used by the Former Tibetan Local Government to Persecute the Masses" held in Lhasa displayed various fetters, handcuffs, finger-clamping instruments, foot-clamping sticks, various wooden yokes, cages, sharp hooks and blades used for cutting off noses, drawing tendons, gouging out eyes, and digging out hearts, as well as large scorpions caught from the "Scorpion Cave" prison under the Potala Palace (the former feudal government of the Lhasa region, equivalent to a commissioner's office).

In recent days, more than 35,000 people have visited this exhibition, including Lhasa citizens, suburban farmers, and herders and merchants from other places. Bud, a Tibetan youth who had both eyes gouged out, Aliya, who had one eye stabbed blind, and Langjie Pengcuo and his wife, who had been battered by whips in prison, repeatedly recounted to the audience at the meeting the process by which the former Tibetan local government used these instruments of torture to persecute them. After visiting the exhibition, many people wrote angry accusations in the visitor's book, unanimously demanding the rapid implementation of reform and the destruction of the evil serf system. After visiting the exhibition, the farmers of Hemu Huoka in the suburbs of Lhasa said that the former Tibetan local government rode on the heads of the people, used cruel instruments of torture to persecute us, and drank our blood and sweat. From now on, we are determined to unite as one under the leadership of the Communist Party, work hard in production, and use practical actions to destroy the serf system.

The exhibition held in the Shannan area made a sharp comparison between the licentious and extravagant life of Lhalu Losang Tsering(a rebel), the "Wangye" (Lord) of Shannan, and the poverty of the serfs. The exhibition also displayed the instruments of torture and criminal evidence used by the "Wangye" of Shannan to persecute serfs. On a door panel, dozens of severed human heads were placed, with more than a dozen arms of serfs cut off with knives next to the heads. Even more unbearable to witness was the skeleton of a Tibetan girl. Her arms were tied backward, she sat cross-legged on a wooden board, her head drooping, her dry muscles clinging tightly to her bones. She was raped and murdered more than twenty years ago. There were six more corpses of serfs who had been persecuted in this way in the basement of the "Wangye" mansion in Shannan.

The "Exhibition of Criminal Evidence of Rebels" held in Jiangda County, Qamdo, displayed many reactionary documents of the rebels and evidence of their crimes against the people. This evidence revealed the consistent sabotage of national unity and treasonous conspiracies by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique, clearly exposing the ugly faces of this small group of traitors to the Tibetan people.

    西藏劳动人民纷纷参观叛乱分子罪行和农奴制罪恶展览
    一致要求摧毁农奴制
    新华社拉萨10日电　西藏拉萨、山南和昌都等地区有成千上万的农牧民，观看了各地最近举办的揭露西藏叛乱分子罪行和农奴制度罪恶的展览会。
    在拉萨举办的“原西藏地方政府残害群众的刑具罪证展览会”，展出了各种脚镣、手铐、夹指刑具、夹脚棍，各式木枷、囚笼，割鼻、抽筋、挖眼、挖心用的尖钩利刃，以及从布达拉宫下面雪列空（原拉萨地区封建政府，相当于专署）的“蝎子洞”监狱中捉来的大蝎子等。
    连日来参观这个展览会的已有三万五千多人，其中包括拉萨市民、郊区农民和外地来的牧民和商贩等。被挖掉了双眼的藏族青年布德、被刺瞎了一只眼睛的阿里亚和在监狱中饱经皮鞭摧残的朗杰彭错夫妇，在会上向观众一次又一次地控诉了原西藏地方政府用这些刑具迫害他们的经过。很多人参观后在留言簿上写下了愤怒的控诉，一致要求迅速实行改革，摧毁万恶的农奴制度。拉萨郊区合木豁卡的农民们在参观后说，原西藏地方政府骑在人民头上，用残酷的刑具来迫害我们，喝尽了我们的血汗。今后，我们决心在共产党的领导下，团结一致，努力生产，用实际行动来摧毁农奴制度。
    山南地区举办的展览会，把山南“王爷”拉加里·朗杰嘉措（叛乱分子）的淫逸奢侈生活和农奴们的贫困生活情况做了一个鲜明的对比。这个展览会还展出了山南“王爷”残害农奴的刑具和罪证。在一块门板上，摆着几十个已被锯开的人头，人头旁边放着十多只用刀砍下来的农奴的手臂。更令人惨不忍睹的，是一具藏族少女的骨架。她的双臂向后反绑着，盘膝坐在一块木板上，头向下低垂着，干枯的肌肉紧贴着骨胳。她是二十多年前被奸污后遇害的。像这样被残害的农奴的尸体，在山南“王爷”府的地下室里还有六具。
    在昌都江达县举行的“叛乱分子罪证展览会”上，展出了很多叛乱分子的反动文件和残害人民的罪证。这些罪证揭露了原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团一贯破坏民族团结进行叛国阴谋活动的情况，清楚暴露了这一小撮西藏人民的叛徒的丑恶面目。
