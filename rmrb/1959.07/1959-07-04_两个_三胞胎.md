    Two "Triplets"
    In the Shannan area of Tibet, there are two widely circulated stories about "triplets." One is about a woman who gave birth to three daughters in the past, and the serf owner falsely accused them of being "demon girls" and killed the adorable babies. In such a serf society, countless promising young lives were killed. The other is about a woman who gave birth to three sons today, and they received condolences and relief from the People's Government. This is truly a joyous and auspicious occasion of adding new members to the family! The same "triplets" received completely different fates. This shows the profound revolutionary changes taking place in Tibetan society. We wish these three adorable babies well. At the same time, we congratulate all Tibetan brothers and sisters. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through gradual democratic reforms and socialist construction, their lives will become brighter and happier day by day!

    两个“三胞胎”
    西藏山南地区，盛传着两个“三胞胎”的故事，一个是，过去一胎生了三女，被农奴主诬称“妖女”，把可爱的婴儿杀害了；这样的农奴社会，不知道杀害了多少有希望的小生命；一个是，今天一胎生了三子，受到人民政府的慰问和救济；这真是添丁增口，喜庆吉祥双临门！同样的“三胞胎”，得到了完全不同的遭遇。这说明西藏社会正在发生的深刻的革命变化。我们祝福这三个可爱的婴儿。同时也祝贺全西藏兄弟民族，在中国共产党领导下，经过逐步的民主改革、建设社会主义，生活一天天过得更加光明幸福！
