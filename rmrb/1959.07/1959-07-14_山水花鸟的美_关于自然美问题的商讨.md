    The Beauty of Landscapes, Flowers, and Birds
    ——A Discussion on the Question of Natural Beauty
    Li Zehou
    I read Fan Zhongyan's "Yueyang Tower" when I was in middle school. I happened to browse through last year's junior high school literature textbook and read this article again. There is a beautiful passage in the middle: "As for the continuous rain and gloom, lasting for months; the howling of the gloomy wind, the turbid waves filling the sky; the sun and stars hidden, the mountains concealed; merchants not traveling, masts leaning and oars breaking; twilight descending, tigers roaring and monkeys wailing; ascending this tower, one feels homesick, fearful of slander and criticism, the sight filled with desolation, feeling extremely sad. As for the spring breeze and bright scenery, the waves calm, the sky above and below the same color, a vast expanse of blue; sand gulls soaring, brocade scales swimming; irises on the bank, orchids on the islet, lush and green; or perhaps the long smoke clears away, the bright moon shines for thousands of miles, the floating light leaps like gold, the still shadow sinks like jade, fishermen's songs answer each other, what boundless joy! Ascending this tower, one feels relaxed and happy, forgetting both honor and disgrace, holding a cup of wine in the wind, the joy is boundless..." The same place, different natural scenery brings different feelings of sadness or joy... But, sadness and joy cannot be hidden in the ignorant and unconscious nature itself, nor can they be arbitrarily added by people's subjective consciousness. "Spring breeze and bright scenery" will not make people "feel extremely sad"; "the howling of the gloomy wind, the turbid waves filling the sky" generally cannot make people "relaxed and happy" "the joy is boundless"... So, where exactly does the beauty of natural scenery – landscapes, flowers, and birds – lie?
    When a person encounters a tiger in the deep mountains, they either fight the tiger like Wu Song or turn around and run away. There is absolutely no way to appreciate it, which is very different from seeing a tiger in a zoo; when encountering a heavy thunderstorm during marching or harvesting, besides cursing, few people can still have the poetic interest of sleeping soundly at night and reciting "The sound of wind and rain last night, how many flowers have fallen". Therefore, Comrade Zhang Geng said it well: "The change in the relationship between man and nature" is what makes nature "become beautiful" (see "Guilin Landscape", People's Daily, June 2, 1959). What the primitive races who lived by hunting depicted and carved were only their hunting objects. These wild cattle and hippos, which do not seem very elegant today, have become their aesthetic objects precisely because these natural objects are closely related to their lives and have good social life content and ideals, right? As for the general landscape scenery, flowers and birds, they are either enemies that are fearful and harmful to life, or idle flowers and weeds that are irrelevant to their tense labor of foraging: without close and intimate life connections, there is no aesthetic quality. The same is true for the Guilin landscape. Mr. Zhu Guangqian once gave an example in "Literary Psychology", saying that "a farmer by the sea shyly turned around and pointed to the vegetable garden behind the house when someone praised the beautiful sea view in front of his house, saying: 'Although there is nothing to see in front of the house, the vegetable garden behind the house is not bad'", in order to illustrate that beauty must be separated from "utility" and "profit". But in fact, even today, certain natural objects still become beautiful because they have this relatively obvious, direct and important "practical" and "utilitarian" relationship with people's social life, so that people feel the huge content and ideals of life in them. The reason why sunlight is "beautiful and refreshing" is because it is "the source of vitality in nature", "making our lives warm. Without it, our lives would be dim and sad" (Chernyshevsky: "On the Sublime and the Ridiculous"). The Yellow River and the Yangtze River are beautiful because they are the cradle of our nation's life and reproduction. Good weather is good for work, making life happy, so "spring breeze and bright scenery" and "calm waves" make people "joyful," even if you personally do not do the labor of fishing.... The corn and sweet potatoes painted by farmers in Pi County, and the cabbage and pumpkins painted by Qi Baishi, make people feel the joy of labor life; while the floral cloth printed with centipedes and beetles, and the fairy tales describing rats and jackals as kind masters, make us feel disgusted and awkward... don't these well illustrate that the objective social life characteristics of nature (a certain good and beneficial connection, relationship, function, etc. with social life) are the fundamental basis and essence of its beauty? Away from human life, it is difficult to talk about whether nature is beautiful or not. If artistic creation does not grasp and express the human and living content of natural objects, it is difficult to become beautiful landscape poetry and landscape painting.
    The beauty of nature is changing and developing, developing with the development of people's social life, and as nature is continuously conquered by human labor, the objective relationship between nature and people's social life becomes richer and more complex, and becomes rich and complex. When nature is no longer a terrifying and fearsome monster but a kind and approachable friend, when landscapes, flowers, and birds are not only the objects of labor production but also places and objects for people to rest and entertain, and when this aspect plays an increasingly important role, people not only appreciate the beauty of the sun, but also appreciate the beauty of the moon; not only appreciate the beauty of crops, but also appreciate the beauty of plum blossoms; and sometimes appreciate the beauty of plum blossoms and the moon more... Although plum blossoms and the moon cannot be eaten or worn, nor are they the direct objects conquered by people's labor, and have nothing to do with narrow utilitarianism. But the life content of entertainment, love, walking, and lyricism under the moonlight... is not the main reason why the moon becomes beautiful and becomes an artistic object? In this way, the beauty of landscapes, flowers, and birds – the entire nature – has become increasingly detached from the situation of being completely bound and limited to narrow and direct economic and utilitarian relationships, and has acquired far more extensive and at the same time far more tortuous, obscure, indirect, and complex life content and meaning, because the development of social life has caused the full unfolding of the rich relationship between nature and people (this is the true meaning of the so-called "people of nature"). Now, the same natural object has diverse and different properties and meanings in different life relationships, occasions, or conditions: tigers or rats, foxes or beetles can become objects of beauty and art because of their cleverness or bravery under conditions that do not seriously endanger and threaten people's lives, while manure and fat pigs, although practical, are not necessarily the themes of today's singing and depiction because of their stench or clumsiness. Some idealist aestheticians have used this to say that beauty, such as flowers and clouds, does not have any practical content of life and is "free beauty" and "pure beauty" without any purpose concept, but in fact it is only because the content of life of natural beauty has become more complex and broadened. Precisely because the content of life is so rich, art should not only have the sun and crops, pumpkins and corn, but also plum blossoms and peonies, stars and the moon; not only "flat fields intersect with distant winds, good seedlings also embrace newness," but also "the bright moon shines among the pine trees, and the clear spring flows over the rocks."
    However, here, we should distinguish between two so-called "humanization": the objective and actual "humanization of nature" (created by social life) and the "humanization of nature" in art or appreciation (created by the role of consciousness). The reason why nature becomes beautiful is due to the former rather than the latter. The latter is only a tortuous and complex dynamic reflection of the former. Similarly, we should also distinguish between two so-called "leaving": "leaving people" and "leaving people's analogy". Leaving people (that is, leaving people's lives, leaving the objective relationship between nature and people), natural beauty does not exist; leaving people's analogy (or leaving people's culture, leaving the subjective connection between nature and consciousness), natural beauty still does not lose its beauty. The Guilin landscape is indeed more attractive because of its beautiful name, moving legends, and lyrical inscriptions... But "I do not have this feeling: if these mountains had never had names, they would have completely become stubborn stones and could not give people any enjoyment of the mind and spirit. On the contrary, it is in this atmosphere of 'unfamiliarity' that the beautiful mountains and clear waters, the hazy in the drizzle, the calm as a mirror when the rain stops and the clouds rise, the clear reflection, the scenery of blue and green above and below. The slight golden realm that shines in the whole blue and green world when a wisp of afterglow obliquely reflects on the top of the mountain and the surface of the water when the evening clears: these are all very charming." ("Guilin Landscape") Obviously, this shows that: even if people have not added analogies and names to the Guilin landscape, without Han Yu's poems and Liu Sanjie's legends, it is still beautiful. In fact, when you go to Xishan or the suburbs, the natural scenery that hits you in the face brings you aesthetic pleasure, which does not need to be generated after "analogy", "inscription" or "legend". On the contrary, "the leisurely and longing appreciation of natural beauty drives away all our memories, we simply do not think of anything, but only think of the object of appreciation in front of us" (Chernyshevsky: "Critique of Contemporary Aesthetic Concepts"). Therefore, I think that Comrade Zhang Geng's article "Guilin Landscape" mixes two different "humanizations" and "leaving", so that a basic point in the article: the view that "the humanization of landscape" is "a product of ideology"; natural beauty is "an existence of ideology", and there is no natural beauty without people's analogy and culture... (which is very close to Mr. Zhu Guangqian's opinion: believing that beauty is the result of the action of thought and consciousness on objective objects), is what I cannot agree with.
    Giving nature artistic analogies and symbols, endowing it with "the meaning of ideology", giving it "humanization" in consciousness, that is, emotion and imagination, cannot create natural beauty, but it can make people's appreciation of natural beauty form an aesthetic attitude with more definite and specific social content and meaning, and can enhance and guide people's attitude and direction of appreciation. Seeing pine and cypress and feeling their fortitude and longevity, seeing bamboo and plum and thinking of their uprightness and integrity..., national art and culture make our aesthetic feelings have this specific concrete content (foreigners may not necessarily have this content for the beauty of pine, bamboo and plum). Therefore, "art objects... create the masses with artistic emotion and aesthetic ability. Therefore, production not only produces objects for the subject, but also produces subjects for objects" (Marx: "Introduction to the Critique of Political Economy"). Art should be good at using rich emotions and imagination, using various techniques of analogy, symbolism, association, allegory, etc. to vividly render, exaggerate, and concentrate the beauty of the object, to edify and infect people's consciousness, so that people's aesthetic attitude and appreciation taste for life and nature become increasingly full, diverse, and have more explicit and directional social content, and more keenly feel the beauty and ugliness of the object, with this kind of influence and guidance. The analogy of flowers like beauties makes people feel that both flowers and beauties are more beautiful, and the publication of "Who is the Most Lovable Person" makes people love the volunteers more in life. The naming and poetry of Guilin landscape also played the same role. Therefore, the question here is what kind of thoughts and emotions, what kind of analogies and symbols (imagination) the artist uses to guide people. The same Guilin landscape can be described as "soft and beautiful" like Han Yu's poems, or can be chanted by Liu Zongyuan as "bitter" and "stern"... The artist's emotions and imagination have broad creative freedom here. But the reason why Han's poems are more popular than Liu's poems is also because its emotions and imagination are after all more in line with the kind of intimate and pleasant life content and the natural appearance of the strange mountain shape that Guilin landscape has for people. Therefore, if the artist wants to do a good job in "the blending of emotion and scenery" and "writing intention with scenery," he must pay attention to making his emotions and imagination conform to a certain nature or aspect of the life content and natural image of the objective object, so that the "humanization of nature" in his art conforms to a certain characteristic of the "humanization of nature" in objective reality.
    Nature has no class nature. The class nature of natural beauty that Comrade Zhang Geng talks about is only the class nature of the appreciation of natural beauty, that is, the aesthetic attitude of different classes. This class nature is determined by people's entire objective life, and is also partly determined by the different objective life relationships between nature and different classes. The working people are the direct transformers of nature, their objective life relationship with nature is positive, progressive, and combative, and their aesthetic attitude, appreciation of emotions, and imagination towards nature are generally strong, optimistic, and cheerful. But in the past under the exploitation system, they were long bound in the difficulties and busyness of life, and they rarely had the leisure, mood, and conditions to travel and appreciate natural scenery, so they often cursed the rainstorm without appreciating it, and often praised crops and vegetable gardens more and paid less attention to plum blossoms and sea views... Plum blossoms and sea views were really too unimportant to their lives! In this regard, people in the exploiting classes who were detached from labor in history took a step ahead because they possessed the practical achievements of labor: when boatmen and fishermen were suffering from "turbid waves filling the sky" and "masts leaning and oars breaking," poets could get rid of the coercion of life and nature to appreciate and chant the beautiful scenery of "luan stones collapsing clouds, startling waves breaking the shore, rolling up thousands of piles of snow"; when the heroes of Liangshan were ruined and forced to take risks, Emperor Huizong still had the leisure to carefully observe the details of "peacocks rising must first raise their left feet" to create beautiful paintings... However, the Summer Palace, which was for Empress Dowager Cixi to play with, is also played and appreciated by us today, and the flower and bird paintings of Emperor Huizong of Song, just like the landscape poems of Wang Wei and Meng Haoran, still have artistic value today, and in the future, the broad masses of working people will still come to appreciate and affirm them. Why? Because they after all began to truly reflect to varying degrees the rich and diverse life content of play, appreciation, entertainment, and comfort that nature has for people (although they were first possessed and enjoyed by them), reflecting the beauty of landscapes, flowers, and birds.
    However, for the exploiting classes and feudal scholar-officials who were detached from labor, nature was mainly a place for them to enjoy themselves, play, or avoid politics and seek comfort. "In my later years, I only like to be quiet, and I don't care about anything; I take care of myself without a long-term plan, and I only know to return to the old forest" (Wang Wei). Their objective life relationship with nature is generally passive, compromising, and reclusive. This makes their reflection of natural beauty have great limitations of the times and classes: the landscapes, flowers, and birds they like to chant and depict are generally "the ferry should only be quiet, and people should be sparse" ("Landscape Tips"), "Outside the setting sun, a few cold crows, and a stream around a lonely village"... They always mixed with various quiet, secluded, sentimental, mournful, and lazy feudal pastoral life tones and atmospheres, emotions, and imaginations.
    Today should be completely different. The beauty of landscapes, flowers, and birds in today's art should fully reflect the new content of the life of the times. This new content does not lie in simply cutting and pasting something or a concept as a label of the times and a social symbol on landscapes, flowers, and birds: "Draw a few small fish and write 'Strive to go upstream'; draw two ducks and also write 'Strive to go upstream'"; "Draw factory chimneys in the flower bushes and decorate a few earthen blast furnaces in the landscape paintings" (of course, you can also draw like this, but it is not the main way), but in "excavating the beauty of the object itself" (the quotations are from He Rong: "The Beauty of Nature Landscape", "Fine Arts" April 1959). Where is this "beauty of the object itself"? Although there are "earthen blast furnaces" and power stations everywhere now, the appearance and shape of the entire landscape, flowers, and birds have not changed much. What has changed is mainly its internal relationship with people's lives: today, we not only fundamentally begin to gradually overcome the one-sided development of nature as a production object and as a pleasant object, which was previously held by different classes, and fundamentally create various subjective and objective conditions for the working people to appreciate landscapes, flowers, and birds more freely and broadly; but also make the relationship between nature and people's pleasure and appreciation no longer built on the life basis of escaping from reality, but on the life basis of conquering nature and transforming nature facing reality as never before. In this way, the beauty of landscapes, flowers, and birds in today's art should be as full of this broad, cheerful, healthy, joyful, and upward social life tone and atmosphere as never before in history, just like the beauty of landscapes, flowers, and birds in nature with a new look. It is necessary to deeply grasp this brand-new social life tone and atmosphere in terms of thoughts and emotions, carefully observe and understand the objective appearance of natural objects, and unfold rich and free creative artistic imagination and lyricism under the conditions of highly skilled proficiency. This makes it possible for the "blending of emotion and scenery" in our art today, the beauty of landscapes, flowers, and birds in art to greatly exceed all past Wang Wei and Li Bai, Shi Tao and Bada Shanren, and even Qi Baishi and Huang Binhong.

    山水花鸟的美
    ——关于自然美问题的商讨
    李泽厚
    上中学时读过范仲淹的“岳阳楼记”。偶而翻阅去年的初中文学课本，又读到这篇文章。中间有这么一段漂亮文字：“若夫淫雨霏霏，连月不开；阴风怒号，浊浪排空；日星隐耀，山岳潜形；商旅不行，樯倾楫摧；薄暮冥冥，虎啸猿啼；登斯楼也，则有去国怀乡，忧谗畏讥，满目萧然，感极而悲者矣。至若春和景明，波浪不惊，上下天光，一碧万顷；沙鸥翔集，锦鳞游泳；岸芷汀兰，郁郁青青；而或长烟一空，皓月千里，浮光跃金，静影沉璧，渔歌互答，此乐何极。登斯楼也，则有心旷神怡，宠辱皆忘，把酒临风，其喜洋洋者矣……”。同一个地方，不同的自然景色给人带来了或悲或喜的不同感受……。但是，悲喜既不能藏于无知无识的自然本身，而又非人们主观意识所能随意加上。“春和景明”不会使人“感极而悲”；“阴风怒号，浊浪排空”一般也难得令人“心旷神怡”“其喜洋洋”……。那么，自然景色——山水花鸟的美，究竟又在哪里呢？
    人在深山遇见老虎，不是像武松那样打虎便是掉头就跑，绝对没法去欣赏，这与在动物园里看老虎大不一样；在行军或收割时碰上一场大雷雨，咒骂之余恐怕也少有人还能有夜里睡得安安稳稳一朝醒来吟咏“夜来风雨声，花落知多少”的诗情逸兴。所以，张庚同志说得好：“人与自然之间关系的变化”才使自然“变成美”（见“桂林山水”，人民日报1959年6月2日）。以狩猎为生的原始种族所描绘刻划的，只是他们的狩猎对象。这些今天看来并不怎么雅观的野牛河马所以偏偏成了他们的审美对象，不正因为这些自然物是与他们的生活紧密联系在一起、具有着良好的社会生活内容和理想的原故吗？至于一般的山水景色花花鸟鸟，不是可畏可怖危害生活的仇敌，便是与他们疲于觅食的紧张劳动无关痛痒的闲花野草：没有亲密近切的生活姻缘，便没有美的性质。就是桂林山水，也如此。朱光潜先生以前在“文艺心理学”中曾举过一个例子，说“一个海边的农夫逢人称赞他的门前海景美，很羞涩地转过身来指着屋后的菜园说：‘门前虽然没有什么可看的，屋后这一园菜却还不差’”，借以说明美必须脱开“实用”和“功利”。但实际上，直到今天，某些自然对象也还是因为与人们社会生活具有这种比较明显直接而重要的“实用”“功利”关系，从而使人们在其中感到生活的巨大内容和理想，才成为美的。太阳光之所以“美得令人心旷神怡”，是因为它是“自然界生机的源泉”，“使我们生活温暖，没有它，我们的生活便暗淡而悲哀”（车尔尼雪夫斯基：“论崇高与滑稽”）。黄河长江是美的，因为它们是我们民族生活繁殖的摇篮。好天气才好工作，才使生活愉快，所以“春和景明”“水波不兴”令人“其喜洋洋”，尽管你个人并不去做捕鱼的劳动……。邳县农民画的玉米和甘薯，齐白石画的白菜和南瓜，使人感到劳动生活的喜悦；而印着蜈蚣、甲虫的花布，描写老鼠、豺狼也是善良主人的童话，却使我们感到厌恶和别扭……，这些不都很好地说明了自然的客观社会生活特性（与社会生活的某种良好有益的联系、关系、作用等）才是它的美的根本基础和实质吗？离开人的生活，自然就很难讲有甚么美不美。艺术创作如果不去把握和表现自然对象的人的、生活的内容，也很难成为美的山水诗、风景画。
    自然的美是变化、发展的，是随着人们社会生活的发展而发展，随着自然不断被人的劳动所征服，从而自然与人们社会生活的客观关系愈来愈丰富复杂，而变得丰富和复杂起来。当大自然不再是可怖可畏的怪物而是可亲可近的朋友，当山水花鸟不仅是劳动生产的对象而更是人们休息娱乐的场所、对象，而且这方面的作用愈来愈大的时候，人们就不但欣赏太阳的美，而且欣赏起月亮的美来；不但欣赏庄稼的美，而且也欣赏梅花的美；并且有时是更多地欣赏梅花和月亮的美……。尽管梅花和月亮既不能吃，也不能穿，又不是人们劳动所直接征服的对象，与狭隘的实用毫不相干。但是月光底下的娱乐、恋爱、散步、抒情……的生活内容，不正是使月亮成为美、成为艺术对象的主要原因吗？正是这样，山水花鸟——整个自然的美，因为社会生活的发展造成自然与人的丰富关系的充分展开（这才是所谓“自然的人们”的真正含义），就日益摆脱以前那种完全束缚和局限在狭隘直接的经济的实用功利关系上的情况，而取得远为广泛同时也远为曲折、隐晦、间接、复杂的生活内容和意义了。现在，同一自然物，处在不同的生活关系、场合或条件上具有多样不同的性质和意义：老虎或老鼠，狐狸或甲虫在不严重危害和威胁人们生活的条件下，可因其机灵或勇猛而成为美和艺术的对象，而大粪、肥猪尽管实用，却因其恶臭或蠢笨不一定是今天吟咏描绘的题材。一些唯心主义美学家借此曾说美如花朵、云彩等是不具有任何生活实用内容、没有任何目的概念的“自由美”“纯粹美”，但其实却只是自然美的生活内容更加复杂和广阔化了的原故。正因为生活内容的如此丰富，艺术中就不仅可以有太阳和庄稼、南瓜和玉米，而且也应该有梅花和牡丹、星星和月亮；不仅有“平畴交远风，良苗亦怀新”，而且也可以有“明月松间照，清泉石上流”。
      不过，在这里，应该区别两种所谓“人化”：客观实际上的“自然的人化”（社会生活所造成）与艺术或欣赏中的“自然的人化”（意识作用所造成）。自然之所以成为美，是由于前者而不是由于后者。后者只是前者某种曲折复杂的能动反映。同样，也该区别两个所谓“离开”：“离开人”和“离开人的比拟”。离开人（即离开人的生活，离开自然与人的客观关系），自然美便不存在；离开人的比拟（或离开人的文化，离开自然与意识的主观连系），自然美仍不失其为美。桂林山水固然因为美丽的名字、动人的传说、抒情的题咏……，而愈发引人入胜；但“我并没有这样的感觉：假使这些山从来没有名字，它就完全成了顽石，不能给人任何心快神怡的享受。相反地，就是在这种‘不相识’的气氛中，那种山明水秀的环境，那种细雨中的蒙胧，那种雨止云高时候波平如镜，倒影明澈，上下一片青碧的景色。那种傍晚放晴时候一脉余辉斜映在山头水面，使得整个青碧的天地里略微闪耀着一点淡淡的金色的境界：这些都是非常妩媚的。”（“桂林山水”）显然这说明了：即使人们没有给桂林山水加上比拟和名字，没有韩愈的诗、刘三姐的传说，它也仍是美的。其实，你去西山，你到郊外，迎面扑来的自然景色给你带来的美感愉快，也并不需要经过“比拟”“题咏”或“传说”之后才产生。相反，“对自然美的悠然神往的欣赏，赶走我们的一切回忆，我们简直没有想到什么，只想到眼前欣赏的对象而已”（车尔尼雪夫斯基：“当代美学概念批判”）。所以，我觉得，张庚同志“桂林山水”的文章是把两种不同的“人化”和“离开”混在一起，从而文中的一个基本论点：认为“山水的人化”是“观念形态的产物”；自然美是“观念形态的存在”，离开人的比拟和文化就没有自然美……的看法（这与朱光潜先生的意见很接近：认为美是思想意识作用于客观对象的结果），就是我所不能同意的了。
    给自然以艺术的比拟和象征，赋予它以“观念形态的意义”，给它以意识即情感、想像上的“人化”，并不能创造自然美，但却能使人们对自然美的欣赏形成一种富有更确定更具体的社会内容和意义的审美态度，能增强和引导人们欣赏的态度和方向。观松柏而感其刚毅长寿，见竹梅而想其正直高廉……，民族的艺术文化使我们的审美感受具有这种特定的具体内容（外国人对松竹梅的美感就不一定有这种内容）。所以，“艺术对象……创造着有艺术情感和审美能力的群众。因此，生产不仅为主体生产着对象，而且也为对象生产着主体”（马克思：“政治经济学批判导言”）。艺术本要善于通过丰富的情感和想像，运用各种比拟、象征、联想、寓意等等“比兴”手法，来形象地渲染、夸张和集中对象的美，熏陶感染人们的意识，使人们对生活和自然的审美态度和欣赏趣味随着这种影响和引导而变得日益丰满、多样和具有更明确的倾向性的社会内容，更敏锐地感受到对象的美丑。花朵似美人的比拟一出来，使人感到花朵和美人都更美，“谁是最可爱的人”一发表，使人在生活中更热爱志愿军。桂林山水的取名题诗也起了同样的作用。所以，这里的问题在于艺术家用怎样的思想情感、怎样的比拟象征（想像）来引导人们。同一桂林山水，既可以被描绘得像韩愈诗句那样的“柔美”，也可被柳宗元吟咏为“悲苦”“严峻”……，艺术家的情感和想像在这里有着广阔的创造性的自由。但韩诗所以比柳诗更流传，也因为它的情感和想像毕竟更吻合桂林山水对于人们的那种亲切娱悦的生活内容和山形奇特的自然外貌。所以，艺术家要很好地做到“情景交溶”“以景写意”，就要注意使自己的情感和想像符合于客观对象的生活内容和自然形象的某一个性质或方面，使自己艺术中的“自然的人化”符合于客观现实中的“自然的人化”的某一特征。
      自然是没有阶级性的。张庚同志所讲的自然美的阶级性，只是不同阶级对自然美的欣赏亦即美感态度的阶级性。这种阶级性是被决定于人们的整个客观生活，也部分地被决定于自然与不同阶级的不同的客观生活关系。劳动人民是自然的直接改造者，他们与自然的客观生活关系是积极的、进取的、斗争的，他们对自然的审美态度、欣赏的情感和想像一般也常是坚强、乐观和开朗的。但以前在剥削制度下，长期被束缚在生活的艰难和繁忙中，他们却很少有闲暇、心情和条件来游乐观赏自然景色，所以经常是咒骂暴风雨而不去欣赏它，常常更多地赞美庄稼菜园而较少去理会梅花海景……，梅花、海景对他们的生活也实在是太无关紧要了！这方面，历史上脱离劳动的剥削阶级中的人们却因占有劳动的实践成果而抢先了一步：当船夫渔妇正苦于“浊浪排空”“樯倾楫摧”的时候，诗人们却能摆脱生活和自然的威逼来欣赏和吟咏“乱石崩云，惊涛裂岸，卷起千堆雪”的山水美景；当梁山好汉家破人亡“挺而走险”的关头，徽宗皇帝却仍有闲暇精心观察“孔雀升高必先举左脚”的细节来作出优美的绘画……。但是，供慈禧太后玩赏的颐和园今天也为我们所游玩观赏，宋徽宗的花鸟画，也正如王维、孟浩然的山水诗一样，今天也还是有艺术价值，将来广大的劳动人民也还是会来欣赏和肯定。为什么？因为它们毕竟在不同程度上开始真实地反映了自然对于人们具有的丰富多样的游玩观赏娱乐慰安的生活内容（虽然首先为他们所占有和享受），反映了山水花鸟的美。
    不过，对于脱离劳动的剥削阶级和封建士大夫们来说，自然主要只是他们享乐游玩或避开政治寻求慰安的场所。“晚年惟好静，万事不关心；自顾无长策，空知返旧林”（王维）。他们与自然的客观生活关系一般是消极、妥协、退隐的。这就使他们在反映自然美上具有了很大的时代和阶级的局限性：他们喜欢吟咏、描绘的山水花鸟一般就是“渡口只宜寂寂，人行须是疏疏”（“山水诀”），“斜阳外，寒鸦数点，流水绕孤村”……，其中总或多或少地掺杂浸染着那种种安静、隐逸、感伤、哀怨、懒洋洋的封建牧歌式的生活色调和气氛、情感和想像。
    今天就该完全不同了。今天艺术中的山水花鸟的美应该充分反映出时代生活的新内容。这种新内容不在于把某种事物或概念作为时代标签、社会符号简单地剪贴在山水花鸟身上：“画几条小鱼，题上‘力争上游’；画两只鸭子，也题上‘力争上游’”；“在花丛中画上工厂的烟囱，在山水画中点缀几个土高炉”（当然也可以这样画，但并不是主要的办法），而在于“发掘描写对象本身的美”（引文均见何溶：“美哉大自然风景”，“美术”1959年4月号）。这“对象本身的美”又在哪里呢？尽管现在到处有“土高炉”、发电站，但整个山水花鸟的外貌形体却并没太大的改变，改变的主要是它与人们生活的内在关系：今天不但从根本上开始逐渐克服自然作为生产对象和作为娱悦对象以前在不同阶级那里各持一端的片面发展，从根本上为劳动人民开创能更自由更广阔地欣赏山水花鸟的各种主客观条件；而且更使自然与人们的娱悦欣赏关系也不再建筑在逃避现实的生活基础上，而是建筑在史无前例地征服自然改造自然等面向现实的生活基础上。这样，今天艺术中的山水花鸟的美应该同自然中的山水花鸟的美一样，面貌一新地饱满地具有着历史上从未有过的这种广阔、开朗、健康、欢乐、向上的社会生活的情调和气氛。正是需要从思想情感上深刻地把握住这种崭新的社会生活的情调和气氛，精心观察领会自然对象的客观形貌，在技巧的高度纯熟的条件下，展开丰富自由的创造性的艺术想像和抒情，这就有可能使我们今天艺术中的“情景交溶”、艺术中的山水花鸟的美大大超过过去一切的王维与李白，石涛与八大山大，甚至齐白石与黄宾虹。
