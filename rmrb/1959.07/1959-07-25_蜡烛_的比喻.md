    The Metaphor of the "Candle"
    Nancun Yan
    In the past, candles were the primary tool for lighting at night, bright and beautiful, so many people used them in poems and paintings, sometimes using "red candles burning high" to symbolize prosperity, happiness, and celebration; other times using them as a metaphor for "weeping for others," likening them to tragic fates.

    Recently, I occasionally heard a strange argument using candles to compare teachers. Saying something like, "Teachers are like candles, illuminating others and destroying themselves," implying it is an infinitely painful profession. This kind of argument, in the words of Sima Qian, is simply "isn't that absurd!"

    It is certainly true that teaching work "illuminates others." Teachers are the transmitters of the torch of human civilization and one of the bridges for imparting truth and wisdom. The ancient saying "awakening the deaf and the blind" compares the work of teachers to making the blind see again and the deaf hear. From our current perspective, teaching work is also serving the people. From the perspective of building communism, teachers are cultivating new people with both virtue and talent for the motherland, and the significance of teaching work is no less than that of any other career. The Party entrusts the future and hope of the motherland, and the people entrust their own children to teachers for cultivation, which further illustrates the Party and the people's lofty trust. Therefore, as a people's teacher, one should first feel proud and happy.

    As for talking about "destroying oneself," may I ask what the basis is? While completing teaching tasks, teachers, under the education of the Party and the promotion of students, achieve "knowing difficulties after teaching," reflecting on themselves, striving for self-improvement, and achieving mutual growth in teaching and learning. Therefore, the process of teaching others is also a process of continuous improvement for teachers themselves. Thus, while illuminating others, teachers also make themselves brighter. Where is the destruction? Especially the younger generation who are educated, who develop into heroes, models, and experts because of the education they receive, every hero will have the shadow of a teacher, and every medal will have the glory of a teacher. Isn't this another unique advantage of teaching work?

    What should also be said is this: even if one really sacrificed oneself to illuminate others, could that really be regarded as a terrible destruction? Of course not. Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed themselves for others, using their blood and heads, using their youthful lives to illuminate the path forward for us. Fang Zhimin, Ji Hongchang, Huang Jiguang, Liu Hulan, Xiang Xiuli… this series of brilliant names, along with their incomparably glorious achievements, will be forever preserved in our memory and passed down from generation to generation. Precisely because they illuminated others, they also truly became immortal. The broad masses of people take pride in this, and the broad masses of youth learn from them with infinite admiration. The martyrs died without regret. Isn't this exactly what we often sing praises of?

    Those who are afraid of illuminating others and "destroying themselves" must first have darkness in their hearts. Such people should first receive the cleansing of light from the brilliance of revolutionary heroes to dispel the darkness in their hearts, and then they will be qualified to be teachers. Otherwise, they can only contaminate others and degrade themselves, how can they illuminate others? In the world, there is only one kind of person who neither generates heat nor light, and relies solely on extracting the light and heat of others to warm themselves, and that is the parasites of the exploiting class. Those who are afraid of being "candles," their views are probably tainted from there.

    To be muddled and swaying throughout one's life, unable to illuminate others at all, and ultimately to be extinguished, that is the truly terrible destruction!

### “蜡烛”的比喻

    “蜡烛”的比喻
    南村燕
    以前蜡烛是人们夜间取亮的主要工具，明亮而优美，故不少人把它入诗入画，有时作为“红烛高烧”来象征繁华幸福喜庆；有时则喻为“替人垂泪”，是形比悲惨命运的。
    最近偶尔听到一种怪论，用蜡烛来比喻教师。说什么
  “教师像一支蜡烛照亮了别人毁灭了自己”，是无限痛苦的职业。这种论调，用太史公的话来说，就是“岂不谬哉”！
    教师工作“照亮别人”，诚然不错。教师是人类文明火炬的传递者，是传授真理智慧的桥梁之一。古云“振聋发聩”，把教师比做是使瞎子重见光明、聋子听见声音的事业。从我们现在的眼光看教师工作也是为人民服务的。从建设共产主义的需要来看，教师在为祖国培养德才兼备的新人，教师工作的意义绝不亚于任何其他事业。党把祖国的未来和希望，人民把自己的亲生骨肉交给了教师培养，这又说明党和人民的崇高信赖。因而做为人民教师首先应该感到自豪和幸福。
    至于谈到“毁灭自己”，请问有什么根据？教师在完成教学任务的同时，在党的教育和同学的促进下做到“教然后知困”，反求诸己，自强不息，而达到教学相长。所以教人的过程也是教师自己不断提高的过程。因而教师在照亮别人的同时也使自己更加光明了。哪里是毁灭了呢？特别是受教的年轻一代，因受教益而发展成为英雄、模范、专家，在每个英雄的身上都将留有教师的影子，每颗奖章里都有教师的光荣。这岂不又是教师工作的得天独厚吗？
    话还应该说回来。即便真的为了照亮别人而牺牲了自己，难道就能看作是可怕的毁灭吗？当然不是。无数革命先烈不正是舍己为人，以自己的鲜血头颅，以自己青春的生命照亮了我们前进的道路吗？方志敏、吉鸿昌、黄继光、刘胡兰、向秀丽……这一系列光辉的名字，连同他们辉煌无比的业绩将永远保留在我们记忆里，并且一代一代传递下去。正因为他们照亮了别人，他们也真正地永垂不朽了。广大人民以此引为自豪，广大青年怀着无限崇敬的心情向他们学习。烈士们死而无憾。这不正是我们经常歌颂的内容吗？
    害怕照亮别人“毁灭了自己”的人，首先应是由于他们心地的黑暗，这种人倒是先要向革命英雄们的光辉里去承受光明的洗涤，以驱散那心底的黑暗，然后才有资格当教师的。否则他只能染污别人堕落自己，哪里又能照亮别人呢？世界上只有一种人自己不发热也不发光，专依靠榨取别人的光热来温暖自己，那就是剥削阶级的寄生虫。害怕做“蜡烛”的人，他们的观点怕就是从那里沾染来的。
    一生之中，昏昏蒙蒙，摇摇曳曳，根本无法照亮别人，而本身又终归要熄灭，那才是真正可怕的毁灭呢！
