Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 3rd: Reporter Gong Ce reports: Two "triplet" stories are circulating in Gonga Zong in the Shannan region, which serve as a stark contrast between the old and new Tibet: In the past, a woman who gave birth to three daughters was called a "demon woman" by the serf owners, killed, and then covered in mud to be made into a Buddha to deceive people; today, after the rebellion was quelled, another woman gave birth to three sons and received care and proper attention from the People's Government. Twenty years ago, a poor woman in Jiare Xika in Gonga Zong gave birth to three daughters and tried her best to raise them. When the children reached the age of three, the lord of this Xika—a reactionary lama from Drepung Monastery—came to the countryside and discovered them. He insisted that it was impossible for a woman to give birth to triplets, so these three children were "demon women," and forced them to be taken away. Later, in three small temples belonging to Drepung Monastery near Jiare Xika, three small mud statues called "fairies" appeared. It turned out that after the reactionary lama snatched the three girls, he killed them after a period of time, and the corpses of the three children were covered with a layer of mud, becoming "fairies" and enshrined in the temple to deceive people. After the poor mother learned about this, she was heartbroken and almost went mad, and soon died in pain.

After the rebellion in the Shannan region was quelled, cadres from the Military Control Commission's work team learned about the whole story and found one of the three "fairy" mud statues. I saw it a few days ago at a small exhibition in Lhasa. The body of the child, which had been made into a mud statue, was less than two feet tall, wearing colorful little clothes, and the mud on its face was about to fall off due to age, and had already turned mottled black. People who visited the exhibition felt immense anger at the inhumane atrocities of the reactionary serf owners.

But today, the three twin sons of Wozhu, a poor farmer in Jixiong Xika in Gonga Zong, have a different fate. Wozhu's wife also gave birth to triplets in May. Local farmers said: The rebellion has been quelled, and the population is prospering again. This is a double blessing of joy and good fortune. Because of poverty and the looting by the bandits, Wozhu's family found it very difficult to raise three children. The People's Government sent special personnel to relieve them with tea, zanba, and other items. The staff expressed their condolences to the mother of many children and encouraged her: For the happiness of the next generation and the prosperity of the Tibetan population, we must do our best to raise the three children to adulthood. People believe that when they grow up, they will no longer be slaves, and they will no longer have the fate of "demon women."

    西藏新旧时代的鲜明对比
    过去：一胎生三女被农奴主当做“妖女”杀害
    今天：一胎生三子受到人民政府的照顾和关怀
　  新华社拉萨3日电  记者宫策报道：山南地区的贡嘎宗流传着两个“三胞胎”的故事，正好成为西藏新旧时代的鲜明对比：过去时代里有一个妇女一胎生了三个女儿，被农奴主说成“妖女”，杀害后又在尸体上涂上泥做成菩萨骗人；今天，在叛乱平息以后，又有一个妇女一胎生了三子，得到了人民政府的关怀和妥善照顾。二十年前，贡嘎宗的加热溪卡有一个贫苦妇女一胎生了三个女儿，她辛辛苦苦地尽力来扶养这三个孩子。当孩子长到三岁的时候，这个溪卡的领主——哲蚌寺的一个反动喇嘛下乡来发现了她们，硬说人不可能一胎生三子，因此这三个孩子是“妖女”，并且强迫把这三个孩子带走。后来，便在加热溪卡附近属于哲蚌寺的三个小寺庙里，出现了三个被称为“仙女”的小泥菩萨，原来这个反动喇嘛把三个女孩子抢走以后，过了一个时期就把她们杀害了，三个孩子的尸体外面被糊上一层泥巴，就变成了“仙女”，供奉在寺庙里骗人。可怜的母亲知道这件事以后，痛不欲生，几乎变得疯狂，不久便痛苦地死去了。
    山南地区的叛乱平息以后，军管会工作队的干部了解到这件事的始末，并且找到了三个“仙女”泥菩萨中的一个。记者前几天在拉萨的一个小型展览会上看到了，这个被做成泥菩萨的孩子的尸体，它不到两尺高，穿着花色的小衣裳，脸上涂的泥巴因为年久，快要脱落了，而且已经呈现出斑斑的黑色。参观这个展览会的人对反动农奴主这种灭绝人性的暴行都感到无比的愤怒。
    但是今天，贡嘎宗吉雄溪卡贫苦农民窝竹的三个孪生子却是另外一种命运。窝竹的妻子在5月间也一胎生了三子，当地农民说：叛乱平定了，人口又在兴旺，这是喜庆吉祥双临门。因为贫困和叛匪的抢劫，窝竹一家抚养三个孩子感到十分困难，人民政府就派专人带着茶叶和糌粑等物品来救济他们，工作人员慰问了多子的母亲，并且鼓励她：为了下一代的幸福，为了西藏人口的繁荣，要尽心尽意把三个孩子抚养成人。人们相信：他们长大以后既不会再当奴隶，更不会再有“妖女”的命运了。
