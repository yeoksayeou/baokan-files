Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, July 10th: People from all walks of life in the Mongolian capital held a grand meeting at the State Theater this afternoon to warmly celebrate the 38th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution (July 11th).

Present at the celebration meeting were Mongolian Party and state leaders Tsedenbal, Sambu, Tsende, Tumur-Ochir, Dugersuren, Baljinyam, Molomjamts, as well as ministers of various government departments and heads of various mass organizations.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Mongolia also attended the celebration meeting.

Tsende, Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, delivered a speech at the meeting to celebrate the festival. He said that under the wise leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the Mongolian people have achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction in the motherland. The Mongolian people have victoriously realized the two five-year plans (1948-1957) for the development of the national economy and culture, and are now striving to realize the tasks of the three-year plan for 1958-1960.

Tsende pointed out that great changes have taken place in Mongolia's agricultural and pastoral economy, and the socialist transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry has been basically realized, which will promote Mongolia's rapid advancement on the road of socialist construction. The achievements of Mongolia's economic and cultural construction have shown the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system to the world and created good conditions for further accelerating socialist construction. At present, the Mongolian people are implementing the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party on building the material basis of socialism and speeding up construction. Whether in cities or villages, a movement to strive to complete the three-year plan ahead of schedule has been launched, and the working people are full of soaring labor enthusiasm for building a better life.

Tsende said that the socialist production competition carried out throughout the country in the first half of this year is an important guarantee for the successful realization of the 1959 production tasks. In the past six months, the Mongolian people have responded to the call of the Party and made achievements in reclaiming wasteland and developing agricultural production; in terms of animal husbandry production, 500,000 more lambs were delivered this year than last year, and the survival rate is very high; industrial production has also increased significantly. According to the implementation of the plan in the first half of the year, the Mongolian people will not only be able to successfully realize this year's production plan, but also many industrial and mining enterprises will realize the three-year plan one year ahead of schedule.

Tsende said, we have always believed that our country's socialist construction is a part of the common cause of the entire socialist camp, and therefore an inseparable part of the world peace cause.

Tsende said that the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council recently called on the people of all countries to designate July 11 as "Mongolia Day" to support the People's Republic of Mongolia's accession to the United Nations. The Mongolian government and people express their gratitude for this support. He said that the Mongolian people and the people of socialist countries have always pursued a peaceful policy and carried out a resolute struggle against the imperialist policy of aggression. The Mongolian people support the struggle of the Asian and African people for national liberation, support the Soviet government's proposal on concluding a peace treaty with Germany and ending the occupation system in West Berlin, demand a cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and demand a summit meeting to resolve major current international issues.

Tsende said that we must further strengthen and consolidate the unity of the socialist camp, defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and be vigilant at all times to smash the shameful conspiracies of revisionism.

After the celebration meeting, song and dance performances were held.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, July 10th: According to the Mongolian "Truth Daily" report, the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Ulaanbaatar Municipal Committee recently convened a meeting of heads of industrial and mining enterprises, state organs and mass organizations in the capital to discuss the issue of launching a nationwide march towards culture to welcome the 40th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution (July 11, 1961).

Tumur-Ochir, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, said at the meeting that Mongolia has made great achievements in cultural development in the era of the People's Revolution, but there are still shortcomings. Therefore, the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee decided to launch a nationwide march towards culture to welcome the 40th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution.

He said that the march towards culture must be carried out in an organized manner. Our task is to eliminate all backward remnants through this march towards culture. In these two years, we must solve two basic problems: one is to pay attention to hygiene; the other is to study culture. He emphasized that it is necessary to publicize the significance of the march towards culture to people from all walks of life, and the people of the capital should play a model role in the march towards culture.

    乌兰巴托集会庆祝人民革命胜利三十八周年
    蒙古人民决心提前完成三年计划
    党中央号召全民向文化进军迎接国庆四十周年
    新华社乌兰巴托10日电　蒙古首都各界人民今天下午在国家剧院举行大会，热烈庆祝蒙古人民革命胜利三十八周年（7月11日）。
    出席庆祝大会的有蒙古党和国家的领导人泽登巴尔、桑布、曾德、图穆尔—奥奇尔、杜格苏伦、巴尔吉尼雅姆、莫洛姆扎木茨以及政府各部部长、各群众团体的负责人。
    各国驻蒙古的外交使节也出席了庆祝大会。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第二书记曾德在会上作了庆祝节日的讲话。他说，蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党的英明领导下，在苏联及其他社会主义国家的大力帮助下，在祖国的社会主义建设事业中取得了辉煌的成就。蒙古人民胜利地实现了发展国民经济及文化的两个五年计划（1948—1957年），现在正在为实现1958—1960年的三年计划的任务而努力。
    曾德指出，蒙古的农牧业经济发生了巨大的变化，农牧业的社会主义改造任务已基本上实现了，这将促使蒙古在社会主义建设的道路上迅速前进。蒙古经济、文化建设的成就向全世界显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性，并且为进一步加快社会主义建设创造了良好的条件。目前，蒙古人民正在贯彻执行蒙古人民革命党三中全会关于建设社会主义的物质基础，加快建设速度的决议。不论城市和乡村都掀起了争取提前完成三年计划的运动，劳动人民充满了建设美好生活的高涨的劳动热情。
    曾德说，今年上半年，在全国范围内开展的社会主义生产竞赛是胜利实现1959年生产任务的重要保证。半年来，蒙古人民响应党的号召，在开垦荒地，发展农业生产方面取得了成绩；在牧业生产方面，今年比去年多接羊羔五十万头，成活率很高；工业生产也有很大增长。根据上半年计划的执行情况看来，蒙古人民不仅能够胜利实现今年的生产计划，而且将有很多工矿企业单位提前一年实现三年计划。
    曾德说，我们一向认为我国的社会主义建设是整个社会主义阵营的共同事业的一部分，因而也是世界和平事业的不可分割的一部分。
    曾德说，亚非人民团结理事会最近号召各国人民把7月11日作为“蒙古日”来支持蒙古人民共和国加入联合国，蒙古政府和人民对这种支持表示感谢。他说，蒙古人民和社会主义各国人民一贯奉行和平政策，和帝国主义的侵略政策进行坚决的斗争，蒙古人民支持亚非人民争取民族解放的斗争，支持苏联政府关于缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度的建议，要求停止试验核武器，要求召开最高级会议来解决当前重大国际问题。
    曾德说，我们必须进一步加强和巩固社会主义阵营的团结，保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁，随时警惕和粉碎修正主义的可耻阴谋。
    庆祝大会后，举行了歌舞演出。
    新华社乌兰巴托10日电　据蒙古“真理报”报道，蒙古人民革命党中央委员会和乌兰巴托市委员会最近召集了首都各工矿企业、国家机关和群众团体负责人开会讨论为迎接蒙古人民革命胜利四十周年（1961年7月11日）而在全国开展向文化进军的问题。
    蒙古人民革命党中央政治局委员图穆尔—奥奇尔在会上讲话说，蒙古在人民革命的年代里，在文化发展方面取得了很大成就，但是还有不足之处，因此，党的三中全会决定在全国范围内开展向文化进军以迎接蒙古人民革命胜利四十周年。
    他说，向文化进军必须有组织的进行，我们的任务是通过这次向文化进军清除一切落后的残余，在这两年内要解决两个基本问题：一个是要讲卫生；另一个是学习文化。他强调指出，要向各界人民宣传向文化进军的意义，首都人民应该在文化进军中起模范作用。
