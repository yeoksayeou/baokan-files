Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 24th. Cuban President Dorticos warned foreign aggressors in a televised speech on the evening of the 23rd, saying that any anti-Cuban conspiracy would be completely crushed.

Dorticos condemned the American power groups colluding with Cuban traitor groups and dictatorial regimes in the Caribbean region, accusing them of attempting to carry out insidious campaigns against Cuba through institutions they control. Referring to the slanderous anti-communist propaganda carried out by the United States, he pointed out that the Cuban people are fully aware that the purpose of this propaganda is to make our government a counter-revolutionary bastion with ulterior motives, which is nothing more than to reverse our revolution.

Dorticos called for mutual support from the people of the Caribbean region and the entire Latin American region, and emphasized the importance of economic independence for Latin American countries.

Dorticos said that the Cuban government will take control of the sugar sales policy, which was previously controlled by domestic and foreign sugar oligarchs, and will adopt policies to expand sugar sales channels.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 24th. This reporter reports: July 26th, this extraordinary day is approaching. On this day, 500,000 Cuban farmers will hold a grand gathering in Havana to support land reform and oppose foreign aggression.

Trucks loaded with farmers wearing palm hats and knives at their waists, from the Sierra Maestra Mountains in Oriente Province, Las Villas Province, Camagüey Province, and from Cuba's vast green fields, have arrived in the capital one after another. The people of Havana have opened their doors to their farmer brothers.

The capital suddenly presents a rural scene. Men, women, and children are buying straw hats so that they can participate in the grand demonstration alongside their farmer brothers. They surrounded the arriving farmers and asked them hundreds and thousands of questions. Everywhere people are talking about land reform, talking about how to prepare to defend the revolution and support the government.

We went to the train station with the people of Havana to welcome the arriving farmers and also met some farmers living at the University of Havana. Before we went, they had just received gifts such as clothes, towels, and toothpaste from the citizens of Havana.

"My name is Juan Rojas," an old farmer with a dark complexion said to us, extending his rough hand. "I used to live in the capital. For many years. That was when Mr. Tomás Estrada Palma was president. But revolutionary Havana is very different from Mr. Tomás's capital."

He told us that he was from Oriente Province, sixty-eight years old, had four sons, and longed for land reform.

"What kind of work do you do?" "I grow coffee and melons, and take care of a few calves. I sleep very little and get up early. For decades, I have seen the dawn of the Cuban land almost every day." Then, he recalled, "Even in my childhood, I tasted the bitterness of colonialism. Later, I suffered the oppression of successive governments. We Cuban farmers demanded land reform, and we have paid a lot of blood for it. Finally, in our area, the bearded men (referring to the rebel army, who generally wear beards) quickly drove away Batista's soldiers." He also proudly told us that his two nephews had also joined the rebel army.

"Do you believe that land reform can improve the lives of farmers?" "Improve life? I hope it's like a life! Until today, we can only make ends meet. Many people can't even do that. We sow, sleep very little, but we don't even have a few rags. Life can't just be this, so our need for land reform is more urgent than daily bread. The entire countryside demands land reform."

Reyes, a farmer from Mercedes de Sibacoa, told us about his experience of working as a laborer for landlords and factory owners for thirty-eight years. More and more farmers gathered around us, all wanting to talk to us about their living conditions and hopes. Cleofe Martinez, a farmer from Oriente Province, said: "The farmers of Oriente Province wholeheartedly support the Cuban revolution and the rebel army. We have made all preparations. No one can take the fruits of the revolution from our hands."

Augusto Infante, the secretary of the executive committee of the San Luis Farmers Association, told us: "We hope to implement land reform; eliminate traitors, and we farmers of Oriente Province are ready to defend Cuba."

    古巴人民决心保卫革命粉碎侵略
    总统多尔蒂科斯谴责美国进行反对古巴的阴谋
    云集哈瓦那的五十万农民满怀维护革命成果的斗志
    新华社哈瓦那24日电　古巴总统多尔蒂科斯在23日晚发表的电视演讲中警告外国侵略者说，任何反古巴的阴谋都将被彻底粉碎。
    多尔蒂科斯谴责同古巴叛国集团和加勒比地区的独裁政权勾结在一起的美国强权集团，指责它企图通过它所控制的机构进行反对古巴的阴险运动。他在谈到美国所进行诽谤性反共宣传时指出，古巴人民已经充分的认识到，这种宣传的目的，是要使我国政府成为一个别有用心的反共堡垒，这不外是要使我国的革命倒退。
    多尔蒂科斯呼吁加勒比海地区人民和整个拉丁美洲人民的互相支援，并且强调经济独立对拉丁美洲各国的重要意义。
    多尔蒂科斯说，古巴政府将把过去为国内外糖业寡头所控制的食糖销售政策掌握在政府手里，并将采取扩大食糖销路的政策。
    据新华社哈瓦那24日电　本社记者报道：7月26日，这个不平凡的日子临近了。这一天，五十万古巴农民将在哈瓦那举行盛大的集会，支持土地改革和反对外国侵略。
    卡车满载着头戴棕榈帽腰挂着刀的农民们，从奥连特省的马埃斯特腊山区、拉斯维利亚斯省、卡马圭省，从古巴广阔的绿色原野，陆续来到了首都。哈瓦那人向农民弟兄打开了大门。
    首都顿时呈现出一片农村的景象。男人、妇女和儿童在购买草帽，以便和他们的农民弟兄们肩并肩地参加大示威。他们围住了前来的农民，向他们提出成百成千的问题。人们到处都在谈论着土地改革，谈论如何准备保卫革命和支持政府。
    我们曾和哈瓦那人一起到火车站去欢迎前来的农民，也会见了住在哈瓦那大学的一些农民，在我们去以前，他们刚刚收到了哈瓦那市民赠给他们的衣服、毛巾和牙膏等礼品。
    “我叫胡安·罗哈斯”，一位脸色黧黑的老农对我们说，一面伸出粗大的手来。“以前我住在首都。有许多年了。那时托马斯·埃斯特拉达·帕耳马先生当总统。可是革命的哈瓦那已经和托马斯先生的首都大不相同了。”
    他告诉我们说，他是奥连特省人，六十八岁，有四个儿子，渴望着土地改革。
    “你做什么活呢？”“我种咖啡和瓜果，并照管几头小牛。我睡得很少，起得早，这几十年来，我几乎天天看见古巴大地的黎明”。接着，他回忆说，“还在我的童年时代，我就尝到了殖民地的滋味。以后，我又遭受历届政府的欺压。我们古巴农民要求进行土地改革，我们历来为此付出了许多鲜血。终于，在我们那里，大胡子们（按指一般均蓄有胡子的起义军）很快就把巴蒂斯塔的士兵赶走了。”他还骄傲地告诉我们，他的两个侄子也参加了起义军。
    “您相信土地改革能够改善农民的生活吗”？“改善生活？但愿它像个生活！直到今天我们仅能糊口。很多人连这样都办不到。我们播种，觉睡得很少，但我们连破衣服也没有几件。生活不能就只是这些，所以我们对土地改革的需要比每日的面包还迫切。整个农村都要求土地改革”。
    梅尔塞德斯德希瓦科亚的一位农民蕾耶斯向我们叙述了他为地主和厂主干了三十八年苦工的遭遇。越来越多的农民把我们围拢起来，都想和我们谈谈他们的生活情况和希望。奥连特省的一位农民克莱奥费·马丁内斯说：“奥连特省的农民都衷心地拥护古巴革命和起义军。我们已经做好了一切准备。任何人都不能把革命成果从我们的手中夺走。”
    圣路易斯农民协会执行委员会的秘书奥古斯托·因方特对我们说：“我们希望贯彻土地改革；清除叛徒，我们奥连特省的农民正整装以待地保卫古巴。”
