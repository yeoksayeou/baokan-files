    Thoughts After Seeing "Huai Shu Village"
    Zhang Geng
    The theatrical stage has been very lively recently, with many noteworthy plays. A few days ago, I saw Comrade Hu Ke's new work, "Huai Shu Village," at a performance by the military's literary and artistic troupes.
    This play is performed by the Beijing Military Region's Zhan You (Comrades-in-Arms) Cultural Troupe. Although the audience may not be very familiar with the troupe's name, it is actually composed of a core of veteran military drama performers. For example, the main character, Granny Guo, is played by the veteran actress Comrade Hu Peng.
    Comrade Hu Ke's script, Comrade Hu Peng's leading role, and the performance of a troupe with a deep military tradition – I am quite familiar with and appreciate its style. To summarize it in a few simple words, it has life, emotion, and characters, and the artistic expression is very simple and unadorned. And this "Huai Shu Village" is no exception.
    "Huai Shu Village" depicts the great changes in a rural village in Hebei from 1947 to 1958: fierce struggles and a tremendous leap forward. The era is long, and the events are scattered, but the characters are consistent throughout. There is the revolutionary side, the counter-revolutionary side, and the wavering side. The class lines are very clear. These people consistently maintain their own positions and actions in the face of every major social change. Society is developing rapidly, and the issues raised in each movement have different characteristics. However, the struggle is always fierce, and the counter-revolutionaries are constantly retreating, finally ending in their complete defeat. Comrade Hu Ke has taken this historical great contradiction as the subject matter of his drama. If the writer is not familiar with life, the play can easily become dry and uninteresting. But Comrade Hu Ke is not like that. Not only are the characters vivid, but the author's writing is full of love and hate, and overflowing with enthusiasm. Several places in the play are very touching. These places are not earth-shattering scenes on the stage. For example, Liu Genzhu returns from the Korean front and reports to Granny Guo that her son died on the front; for example, Granny Guo returns from a meeting in Beijing and tells visitors about seeing Chairman Mao. The audience is moved by these scenes, of course, not only because the author has written deeply about life and has abundant emotions; it is also very important that the actors have a deep understanding and are full of emotion. In short, the author and the actors are not only familiar with these characters in the play, but also have deep feelings for them and sympathize with them. Because of this, they moved us, the audience.
    The play is a good play, but the last two acts seem weaker than the first three acts. The excavation of life is not as deep as in the earlier parts, giving people a feeling that the telling of the story is more important. Is this because the events are too close to the time of writing, and the author has not digested them enough? I think it's probably not just this aspect, but also that when facing the reality of the Great Leap Forward, the author's romanticism seems insufficient.
    Comrade Hu Ke is a relatively rigorous writer, who has always used a faithful and realistic style to create. This play is also like this. But when writing about the Great Leap Forward, one feels that the strictness of adhering to realism is somewhat insufficient. Here lies a problem: how to combine the high-spirited revolutionary romanticism with the strict realism that the author is usually familiar with.
    I think that after rigorous realism reaches a certain level, a high degree of refinement is urgently needed in art, otherwise it will easily become cumbersome and lose its artistic clarity. This must be paid attention to in both playwriting and performance. If we can achieve a high degree of refinement, we can also achieve artistic exaggeration very appropriately, and exaggeration can be connected to the spirit of romanticism.
    The current theatrical stage is showing a new exploration, which is to break through the original framework from all aspects and absorb new nutrients from traditional opera and other arts. One of the greatest characteristics of Chinese opera is refinement, refined to the point where the rhythm is very clear and prominent. In opera, the boundary between realism and romanticism is not strictly separated, but is often combined. They are integrated into a complete performance without feeling discordant. One of the reasons is its refinement, exaggeration, and strong sense of rhythm. Another reason is that in the playwright's mind, faithfully reflecting reality and developing romantic fantasies are not seen as antagonistic. In many classical Chinese operas, the authors often regard romantic fantasy as an extension of real life, as a future ideal. I think we can also learn from these aspects in drama.
    I've talked too much, so I'll stop here.

### 看过“槐树庄”所想起的

    看过“槐树庄”所想起的
    张庚
    近来话剧舞台上很热闹，引人注目的戏很多，前两天又在部队的文艺会演上看到了胡可同志的新作“槐树庄”的演出。
    这个戏是北京部队战友文工团演的，剧团的名字虽然观众不太熟悉，实际上却是以一批部队话剧老骨干为核心而组成的。比方这个戏的主要人物郭大娘就是老演员胡朋同志担任的。
    胡可同志的剧本，胡朋同志的主角，一个具有深厚部队传统的剧团的演出，它的风格我是比较熟识，也比较欣赏的。如果要用几句简单的话来概括一下，那就是有生活，有感情，有人物，而艺术的表现却又是非常朴素的。而这个“槐树庄”也不例外。
    “槐树庄”写了从1947到1958年这十年来河北农村中的大变化：激烈的斗争和巨大的跃进。年代很长，事情很散，但是人物却是始终一贯的；这里有革命的一面，也有反革命的一面，又有动摇的一面，阶级的阵线是很鲜明的。这些人在每一个重大的社会变革前面都始终有自己的立场和行事，社会是飞跃地发展着，每一个运动中所提出来的问题都有不同的性质，然而斗争始终是激烈的，而反革命又是节节败退，最后终于以他们的完全失败作结束。胡可同志就采取了这历史性的大矛盾作为他戏剧的题材。如果是生活不熟悉的作家，戏是很容易写得干巴巴的，而胡可同志却不如此，不但人物活现，而且在作者的笔底下写出来是爱憎分明，热情洋溢的。戏中间有好几处地方非常感动人，这些地方在舞台上并不是什么惊心动魄的场面，比方刘根柱从朝鲜前线复员回来，向郭大娘报告她的儿子在前线牺牲了；比方郭大娘从北京开会回来，向来访的人讲述她看见了毛主席的事。这些场面之感动观众，当然不只是作者在生活上写得深入和感情充沛；演员体验得深和情绪饱满也是很重要的。总之，作者和演员他们不但是熟悉这些剧中人，而且对他们有深厚的感情，同情他们。由于这样，他们才感动了我们台下的观众。
    戏是好戏，但后面的两幕显得比前三幕弱一些，生活上的挖掘也不如前面的深，令人有一种交代故事的成分较重的感觉。这是不是因为事情离开写作的时间太近，作者对它的消化不够之故呢？我觉得恐怕还不是这方面，而是在面对着要表现大跃进这样的现实时，作者的浪漫主义气派似乎还不够的原故。
    胡可同志是一位比较严谨的作家，以往总是运用了忠实写实的笔调来创作的。这个戏也是如此。但在写到大跃进的时候，就感到一味拘泥写实的严谨是有些不够了。这里存在一个问题：如何把那种意气风发的革命浪漫主义精神和作者素常熟悉的严谨写实结合起来。
    我想，严谨的写实达到一定程度之后，在艺术上就迫切需要高度的洗练，否则就容易流于繁琐，而失去艺术上的明快，这在编剧和表演上都必须加以注意。如果我们能够做到高度的洗练，也就能够非常恰当地做到艺术的夸张，而夸张就可以和浪漫主义的精神连接起来了。
    最近的话剧舞台上表现出一种新的探求，那就是想从各方面来突破原有的框子，向戏曲传统，向别的艺术吸收新的养料。我国戏曲的最大特点之一就是洗练，洗练到节奏十分鲜明突出的程度。在戏曲里，现实主义与浪漫主义之间的界限不是壁垒森严的，而常常是互相结合的，它们溶合在一个完整的演出里而并不令人感到不调和，原因之一就是在于它的洗练，夸张和节奏感强烈。原因之又一，则是在剧作者的思想里，并没有把忠实的反映现实和发挥浪漫的幻想看作是对敌的东西，在我国许多古典戏曲的作者常常是把浪漫的幻想作为现实生活的延长来看的，作为未来的理想来看的。这些地方，我觉得我们在话剧方面也是可以学习的。
    话说远了，就此打住罢。
