We carried the Chinese people's friendship and culture and art to the people of Latin America. After passing through Europe and flying over the vast Atlantic Ocean, we traveled more than 20,000 kilometers to South America for a friendly performance tour. We first arrived in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, and then went to Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile. Returning to Europe, we were invited by the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education and Culture to visit and perform in cities such as Prague. We visited and performed in eighteen cities in five countries, and also visited eight cities in these five countries. From leaving Beijing to returning, it has been more than ten and a half months. The time cannot be said to be short, but the profound friendship and enthusiastic reception of the people of South American countries have left a deep impression on our hearts, as vivid as if it were just a moment ago; we can still hear their enthusiastic laughter and cordial conversations even now.

On the eve of the opening performance of the China Acrobatic Art Troupe at the Buenos Aires Cinema Opera House, we held a press conference and screened the film "Chinese Acrobatic Art." Friends from the press, cultural and artistic circles fell in love with Chinese acrobatics as soon as they saw the film. Although the press conference was over, everyone was still talking about it, reluctant to leave. The opening night was even more grand. The artists took curtain calls again and again, and the audience applauded time and time again, not leaving the theater until the artists had taken off their makeup and changed their clothes, ready to return to the hotel. The entrance of the theater was still crowded with audience, with enthusiastic applause, warm handshakes, and sincere congratulations. Many audience members lined up to buy tickets every day, and later there even appeared "black market tickets." People said that Buenos Aires is the cultural center of South America. The Chinese Acrobatic Art Troupe caused a sensation in Argentina and became the center of people's discussions.

In Brazil, the grand occasion surpassed even Argentina. Initially, some Brazilian friends were worried about our performance at the Maracanãzinho Stadium, because this stadium is very large, and although the stage occupies a quarter of the space, it can still accommodate more than 20,000 spectators. At the same time, Brazilian audiences have strict requirements. Whether it could be full, and whether it would satisfy the audience were all concerns. The opening performance was indeed full. Afterwards, people started lining up to buy tickets from the afternoon, even on rainy days. "Black market tickets" were three to four times higher than the original ticket price. At the reception after the opening performance, Mr. Fabio, Vice President of the Brazil-China Friendship Association, raised his glass to congratulate us and said: "You conquered the Brazilian audience in a matter of minutes. Everyone is full of praise for Chinese art! Such a grand occasion is unprecedented in Brazil."

In Uruguay and Chile, we were also warmly welcomed by the audience. In Salto, Uruguay, standing tickets were sold; in Mercedes, after the heavy rain, the roads were filled with water, and the audience waded through the water to buy tickets. When the tickets were sold out, the theater owner simply opened the door and let the audience watch from outside. We heard the same praise in these two countries: This is the first time that a foreign art troupe has achieved such success in Uruguay and Chile.

In the four South American countries, more than 400,000 spectators directly appreciated Chinese acrobatic art. Through television, more than 3 million viewers watched the performances. We also held 37 national music concerts and national music broadcasts. People in some Central and North American countries also listened to Chinese music broadcasts. According to estimates by radio stations in various countries, there were approximately 5 million listeners in total. Because Chinese art was so warmly welcomed by the public, Brazilian record companies invited the national band to make records. Many radio stations repeatedly requested recordings after broadcasting music programs. Because the audience liked the "Chinese yo-yo" program, Brazilian businessmen quickly imitated the Chinese yo-yo with plastic for sale, and the Chinese yo-yo became popular for a time.

Radio stations, television stations, and major newspapers and magazines in various countries, regardless of their political positions, unanimously praised Chinese acrobatic art. The art critic of the Brazilian "Jornal do Brasil" said: "The performance of the Chinese Acrobatic Art Troupe has its unique features, namely: the beauty of the shapes, all the programs are so thrilling and the performances seem so relaxed. Chinese artists perform the most difficult programs with highly accurate movements, making the audience think that the artists are not making any effort at all. That is where the beauty lies." Argentina's "La Nación" said: "Chinese artists have so beautifully integrated the world's oldest art with the individual and the collective. Their control over the strength of the human body is a challenge to the laws of the universe. The exploration of human movement and balance ability has reached the pinnacle." Uruguay's "El País" further said: "No one in the world can control the human body like the Chinese, with such agility, calm character, and humorous demeanor."

Chinese national music and Li Zhi's Chinese folk songs and songs in Spanish and Portuguese were warmly welcomed by audiences in various countries. We held nineteen film receptions in these countries, and also held six exhibitions of Chinese Great Leap Forward pictures and traditional Chinese paintings. Chinese films such as "Ode to the Motherland," "Woman Basketball Player No. 5," and "A Budding Flower" were unanimously praised by friends and audiences in various countries. Many friends told me: Watching "Ode to the Motherland" is like visiting China once, increasing their understanding of China on the screen. Whenever Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, the cinema immediately erupted in storm-like applause. Many friends were amazed when they saw photos of peaceful uses of atomic energy equipment, as well as photos of Chinese-made airplanes, tanks, and automobiles at the exhibition. Chinese traditional paintings and paper-cuts also attracted the attention of people from all countries. The Dean of the Brazilian Academy of Fine Arts took his students to carefully observe and explain Chinese paintings to them.

Culture and art are reflections of people's lives. Through them, we can communicate the feelings between people of different countries and increase mutual understanding. On the soil of culture and art, the flowers of friendship will bloom.

Everywhere we went in Latin America, we felt the overflowing friendship of the people of South American countries towards China. Leaders and important figures of various countries expressed their desire for friendship with China. Argentine Congressman Meng Hadin told me: "Mankind has a great responsibility to China. The Chinese people have made many efforts for peace. I hope that your visit will be the beginning of relations between Argentina and China in all aspects such as culture and trade." Mrs. Kubitschek, the First Lady of Brazil, expressed her willingness to develop cultural exchanges and friendly relations with China. Carlos Fischer, former President of the National Council of Uruguay, said: "The visit of the Chinese Acrobatic Art Troupe is very popular. Chinese art is very attractive. Uruguay had better also send an art troupe that can attract Chinese audiences to visit China. Uruguay attaches great importance to developing trade with China. The Chinese market is very large, and contact should be strengthened." The current President of the National Council, Martín Echegoyen, also said when he received me: "I am an admirer of China. In the past, geographical distance hindered our exchanges. Now that this obstacle has gradually been overcome, the two countries can better develop relations." Raúl Juliett, Speaker of the Chilean House of Representatives, further said: "The Chinese people are now awakened and are building their country at an extremely rapid pace. It is hoped that cultural, artistic, and economic relations between Chile and China can be further developed. The Chilean people will always stand with the Chinese people."

Representatives from the cultural, educational, scientific, political party, business, and judicial sectors of South American countries unanimously expressed their desire to develop and strengthen cultural and economic ties in their contacts with us. During our visits to various countries, we lived in warm friendship. Whenever we came out of the theater, out of the reception of film showings, out of the Great Leap Forward picture exhibitions, out of the tea parties and banquets welcoming us, many people gathered at the door to shake hands with us, ask the artists for autographs, and talk with us cordially. Especially after the performances, at the entrance of the dressing room and at the entrance of the theater, they were crowded with the audience, waiting until after one o'clock in the morning, watching the actors get into the car, and then leaving reluctantly. Some followed the actors' cars, waving and cheering: "Long live China! Long live friendship! Long live peace!"

The farewell performance held at the Luna Park in Argentina was even more exciting. After the performance, the actors took curtain calls again and again, but the more than 20,000 enthusiastic spectators were still unwilling to leave the theater. Everyone stood, and the applause and cheers were like giant waves, one wave higher than the other. The cheers of "Long live China" and "Long live Mao Zedong" resounded through the clouds. Finally, the audience took out white handkerchiefs and waved them high, like more than 20,000 peace doves flying in the theater. Everyone shouted at the same time: "Long live peace!" This expressed the common wishes of the Argentine and Chinese people.

After several days of visits and performances, when we walked on the streets of various cities, we saw people from various countries. Although we did not know each other, many people greeted us kindly and looked at us with smiles, as if they were friends we had known for a long time. Some people came up to talk to us, saying that they had seen our performances in that theater, praised the wonderful Chinese art, and inquired about the situation of the Chinese Great Leap Forward.

The new China stands like a giant on the earth, attracting the attention of people all over the world. Especially the people of Latin America, they know that China used to be a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, which has suffered imperialist aggression and exploitation for nearly a hundred years. In some respects, they share a common destiny with them. After the national liberation, after nearly ten years of efforts, especially after our party put forward the general line of building socialism, we have achieved brilliant results. China, like a red sun, rises from the East, shining with boundless light and full of infinite youthful power. The people of South America are eagerly asking to understand China and have expressed unlimited love for China and Chairman Mao.

We are honored to visit these countries as representatives of China. We brought the Chinese people's friendship to Latin America and returned full of the friendship of the people of South American countries towards China. The people of South American countries, like the Chinese people, hope to develop cultural and economic relations with each other. American imperialism is obstructing it, dreaming of severing the exchanges between Latin America and the people of various countries. But the colonial era is over. American imperialism, like in other parts of the world, is despised by the people of various countries. The magnificent struggle against imperialism and for the protection of national independence and freedom is unfolding in various countries and is rising day by day. Developing cultural and economic relations between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is the common aspiration of the people of the world and is in the interests of the people of all countries. No force in the world can stop it. (Attached pictures)

    友谊的花朵
    周而复
    我们带着中国人民对拉丁美洲人民的友谊和文化艺术，经过欧洲，飞越辽阔无边的大西洋，去南美进行友好访问演出，飞行了两万多公里。首先到了阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯，以后去了巴西、乌拉圭和智利，回到欧洲，应捷克斯洛伐克教育文化部的邀请又在布拉格等城市访问演出。我们一共在五个国家十八个城市进行了访问演出，此外，还到这五个国家的八个城市参观访问。从离开北京到回来，屈指算来，有十个半月之久，时间不能说不够长了，可是南美各国人民对我们深厚的友谊和热情的接待，在我们心中留下了深刻的印象，历历如在目前，好像是一瞬间以前的事；甚至于他们热情的笑声和亲切的谈吐，我们现在也还可以听到。
    中国杂技艺术团在布宜诺斯艾利斯电影歌剧院开幕演出前夕，我们举行了记者招待会，同时放映“中国杂技艺术”电影。新闻界和文化艺术界朋友一看了这部电影，就爱上了中国杂技。招待会虽然已过了结束的时间，可是大家还在谈论着，舍不得离开。开幕演出那晚更是盛况空前，艺术家们一再谢幕，观众一次又一次鼓掌，都不离开剧场，直到艺术家们卸了装换了衣服，准备回到旅馆，剧场门口还挤满了观众，又是热烈的掌声，亲热地握手，衷心地祝贺。每天有许多观众排队购票，以后还出现了“黑市票”。人们说布宜诺斯艾利斯是南美的文化中心。中国杂技艺术轰动了阿根廷，成为人们谈论的中心。
    在巴西，盛况更超过了阿根廷。最初有些巴西朋友为我们在马拉甘?星大体育馆演出担心，因为这个体育馆很大，舞台虽说占去四分之一的地方，可是还可以容纳两万多观众，同时巴西观众要求严格，能不能满座，会不会满足观众要求，都是担心的问题。开幕演出确是满座。以后从下午就开始排队购票，就是下雨天也不例外。“黑市票”价比原来票价高三、四倍。在开幕演出后的酒会上，巴中友好协会副主席法比奥先生举杯为我们祝贺，他说：“你们在几分钟之内就征服了巴西观众，大家对中国艺术赞叹不已！这样的盛况，在巴西是空前的。”
    在乌拉圭和智利也受到观众的热烈欢迎，在乌拉圭萨尔多出售站票；在默尔萨地斯，大雨过后，马路上积满了水，观众涉水购票，票卖完了，剧场老板干脆打开大门让观众在门外看。我们在这两个国家听到同样的赞美：外国艺术团在乌拉圭和智利获得这样的成功，还是第一次。
    在南美四个国家有四十多万观众直接欣赏了中国杂技艺术，通过电视，有三百多万观众看了表演，我们还举行了民族音乐会和民族音乐广播会三十七次，中美一些国家的人民也收听中国音乐广播，据各国电台估计，听众共有五百万左右。因为中国艺术受到公众的热烈的欢迎，巴西唱片公司邀请民族乐队去灌制唱片，许多广播电台广播了音乐节目以后，又一再要求录音。巴西商人由于观众喜爱“空竹”节目，连忙用塑胶仿制中国空竹出售，中国的空竹便风行一时了。
    各国广播电台、电视台和重要的报纸杂志，不论他们的政治立场如何，一致赞扬中国杂技艺术。巴西“新闻日报”艺术评论员说：“中国杂技艺术团的演出有它的独特之处，这就是：造型的优美，所有节目都那么惊险而表演起来又显得那么轻松，中国艺术家以高度准确的动作表演最难的节目，使观众看起来好像艺术家不费力似的，妙就妙在这里。”阿根廷“民族报”说：中国艺术家们把全世界最古老的艺术与个人和集体严密地融合得那样美妙：他们对人体力量的控制，是向宇宙规律的挑战，对人类运动能力和平衡能力的发掘，已到了登峰造极的境地。”乌拉圭“国家报”更进一步说：“世界上还没有任何人能像中国人那样控制着人体，具有那样灵敏的技能，沉静的性格，以及那种诙谐的风度。”
    中国民族音乐和李智唱的中国民歌和西班牙文与葡萄牙文的歌子，受到各国观众热烈的欢迎。我们在这些国家举行了十九次电影招待会，还举行了六次中国大跃进图片和国画展览会。中国电影如“祖国颂”、“女篮五号”、“含苞待放”这些片子，受到各国朋友和观众一致赞扬。许多朋友对我说：看了“祖国颂”等于访问了一次中国，在银幕上增加了对中国的了解。每当毛主席在银幕上出现时，电影院里立即掀起暴风雨般的掌声。许多朋友在展览会上看了和平利用原子能设备的照片，看到中国出产的飞机、坦克和汽车的照片，惊羡不已。中国的国画和剪纸也吸引了各国人民的注意，巴西美术学院的院长带着他的学生细心观摩，同时对学生讲解中国国画。
    文化艺术是人民生活的反映。通过它，可以沟通各国人民之间的感情，增加相互了解。在文化艺术的土壤上，会开放出友谊的花朵。
    我们在拉丁美洲到处感到南美各国人民洋溢着对中国的友谊。各国的领导人员和重要人士都表示了对中国友好的愿望。阿根廷众议院议长孟哈丁对我说：“人类对于中国赋有很大的责任。中国人民为和平尽了不少努力。希望你们这次访问，成为阿根廷和中国文化和贸易等一切方面关系的开始。”巴西库比契克总统夫人表示愿和中国发展文化交流和友好关系。乌拉圭前国务会议主席加尔洛斯·费歇尔说：“中国杂技艺术团的访问，极受欢迎。中国艺术非常吸引人。乌拉圭顶好也派一个能够吸引中国观众的艺术团访问中国。乌拉圭很重视和中国发展贸易。中国市场很大，应该加强联系”。现任国务会议主席马丁·埃切戈延接见我的时候也说：“我是一个中国的钦佩者。过去由于地理上的距离，妨碍了我们往来。现在已经逐渐克服了这种障碍，所以两国可以更好地发展关系。”智利众议院议长劳尔·胡利埃特更进一步说：“中国人民现在是觉醒了，正以极快的速度建设自己的国家。希望智中两国在文化艺术和经济关系方面能够进一步发展。智利人民永远和中国人民站在一起。”
    南美各国的文化、教育、科学、党派、工商和司法等方面的代表人物在和我们接触当中，一致表示了要发展和加强文化和经济等方面的联系。在各国访问期间，我们生活在温暖的友谊中。每当我们从剧场出来，从招待电影会出来，从大跃进图片展览会出来，从欢迎我们的茶会、宴会中出来，门口都聚集着许多人拥上来和我们握手，找艺术家签字，和我们亲切地交谈。特别是演出以后，在化装室门口，在剧场门口，都挤满了观众，直等到深夜一点多钟，望着演员上了车，才不舍地离去。有的跟着演员汽车一道走，一边招手，一边欢呼：中国万岁！友谊万岁！和平万岁！
    在阿根廷月亮公园举行的告别演出，更是激动人心。演完以后，演员再三谢幕，两万多热情的观众还是不肯离开剧场，大家站着，掌声和欢呼像是巨浪一般一浪高一浪，“中国万岁”和“毛泽东万岁”的欢呼声响彻云霄。最后，观众都拿出白色手帕，高高举起手来挥舞，如同两万多只和平鸽子一样在剧场中飞翔，大家同时高呼：“和平万岁！”这表达了阿根廷和中国人民的共同愿望。
    经过几天访问、演出之后，我们在各国城市街上走路的时候，见到各国人民，大家都不相识，但许多人对我们亲切的招呼，微笑地注视我们，仿佛是早已认识的朋友。有些人就走上来和我们谈话，说是在那个剧场里曾经看了我们的演出，赞赏中国美妙的艺术，询问中国大跃进的情况。
    新中国像个巨人般的屹立在地球上，吸引了全世界人民的注意。尤其是拉丁美洲人民，他们知道中国曾经是半封建半殖民地的国家，近百年来遭受帝国主义的侵略和压榨，在某些方面，同他们有共同的命运。全国解放后，经过近十年的努力，特别是我们党提出了建设社会主义总路线之后，获得辉煌成果。中国像红日一样的从东方升起，闪耀着万丈光芒，充满了无限的青春的力量。南美人们如饥似渴地要求了解中国，对中国和毛主席表示了无限的热爱。
    我们荣幸地作为中国的代表，访问这些国家。我们带去了中国人民对拉丁美洲的友谊，满载着南美各国人民对中国的友谊回来了。南美各国人民和中国人民一样都希望相互之间发展文化和经济关系。美帝国主义却从中阻挠，梦想隔断拉丁美洲与各国人民之间的往来。但殖民主义时代已经过去了。美帝国主义在拉丁美洲，像在世界其他地方一样，遭到各国人民的唾弃，波澜壮阔的反对帝国主义维护民族独立自由的斗争正在各国展开，而且是日益高涨。在平等互利的基础上，发展各国之间的文化和经济关系，这是世界人民的共同愿望，是符合各国人民的利益的。世界上没有任何力量可以阻止的。（附图片）
