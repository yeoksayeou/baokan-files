At the Foot of the Tatra Mountains

In Poland, mentioning Zakopane is like mentioning Hangzhou in our country.

Zakopane lies quietly at the foot of the Tatra Mountains on the Polish-Czech border, a small town in the southernmost part of Poland. The year-round snow-capped Tatra Mountains, the straight and tall pine trees, the rapid mountain streams, the small wooden houses of the mountain residents, the ancient carriages, the colorful floral patterns embroidered on the white woolen coats worn by the residents, and their high-pitched and unrestrained songs, all form a fairytale-like beauty. Adding the cable cars climbing the peaks, the ski slopes, the rafts on the Dunajec River, and the gypsy musicians playing their instruments on the riverbank, one immediately feels like entering a paradise.

The cable car is like a small box suspended in mid-air. We rode it up to a peak of the Tatra Mountains that is 1,988 meters high. Sitting in the cable car feels like riding on clouds, light and ethereal. On the mountain, there is a short wooden fence more than a foot high, which is the boundary line between Poland and Czechoslovakia. The border guards of the two countries are chatting there! Language barriers do not exist between them. The language difference between them is the same as that between our Hebei and Henan provinces. We exchanged greetings with the border guards of these two brotherly countries, then stepped over the wooden fence and took a few steps to look at Czechoslovakia from the clouds. We joked that we had visited Czechoslovakia.

The Dunajec River, which flows from the Tatra Mountains, is a famous tributary of the Vistula River, and can be said to be its source. We once rode a raft down the river. The raft was made by tying four long wooden troughs together, with pine branches stuffed into the gaps in between. This kind of raft is like the oxhide raft on the Yellow River in our country. It can only go downstream, and must be pulled back upstream by horses. The Dunajec River not only flows rapidly, but is also dangerous. The river winds its way through the surrounding mountains, often giving one the feeling of "where the mountains and rivers end and there is no road, beyond the willow trees and flowers lies another village." This small river is also the border between Poland and Czechoslovakia. The right bank of the river is Czechoslovakia.

Zakopane is also a favorite place for mountain climbers and skiers. Before the Second World War, two international ski competitions were held here. In 1962, an international ski competition will also be held here. In order to welcome skiers from all over the world and a large number of visitors, Zakopane is preparing to expand. The state has decided to give it a loan of 400 million zlotys to expand sanatoriums, rest homes, ski equipment, and hotels. Zakopane's friends say, come and see us again in 1962, you won't recognize Zakopane then!

Zakopane is a good place to recuperate from lung diseases because of its high altitude (800 meters above sea level) and good air. The sanatoriums here have about 3,000 beds and have doctors who are famous in Europe for treating lung diseases.

Since the Polish people took power, all private sanatoriums in Zakopane have been nationalized, and it has become a good place for the working people to recuperate and take vacations. Since then, this small town with only 25,000 local residents receives one million tourists every year.

    在塔特尔山脚下
    在波兰，提起萨可潘来，就像在我国提起杭州一样。
    萨可潘静静地躺在波捷交界处的塔特尔山脚下，是波兰最南部的一个小城。终年积雪的塔特尔山、笔直高大的苍松、湍急的山溪、山区居民的小木屋、古老的马车、居民穿着的白色毛呢上绣着五彩花朵的民族服装和他们的高亢豪放的歌声，这一切构成了一幅童话般的美景。再加上那攀登山峰的空中缆车、滑雪坡、杜纳耶茨河上的木筏和河畔吉普赛乐师的琴声，使人顿时产生了一种进入桃花源的感觉。
    空中缆车像是悬在半空中的一个小盒子，我们坐着它飞上了塔特尔一个高达一千九百八十八公尺的山峰，坐在缆车上真是腾云驾雾，飘飘欲仙。山上横置一道一尺多高的矮木栏，这便是波捷两国的边界线。两国的边防战士正在那儿谈天呢！语言隔阂在他们之间是不存在的，他们之间的语言差别就同我们的河北省和河南省一样。我们和这两个兄弟国家的边防战士们互相问了好，然后跨过木栏走了几步，从云雾中看了一下捷克斯洛伐克。我们开玩笑说，我们已访问了捷克斯洛伐克。
    从塔特尔山流下的杜纳耶茨河是有名的维斯杜拉河的支流，也可以说是它的泉源。我们曾乘木筏顺流而下，木筏是用四个长形木斗拴在一起的，中间的缝子用松枝塞住。这种木筏同我国黄河上的牛皮筏一样，只能顺流而下，逆流则须用马拉回。杜纳耶茨河水流不但急，而且险。河水在周山环抱中曲折前进，时常有“山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”的感觉。这条小河也是波捷两国边界。河右岸便是捷克斯洛伐克。
    萨可潘也是爬山运动员和滑雪运动员喜爱的地方。第二次世界大战前，在这儿就曾举行过两次国际滑雪比赛。1962年，还将在这儿举行国际滑雪比赛。为了迎接世界各地的滑雪运动员和大批参观者，萨可潘正预备扩建。国家已决定给它四亿兹罗提贷款，用来扩建疗养院、休养所、滑雪设备和旅馆等。萨可潘的朋友说，你们1962年再来看看吧，那时你们会认不出萨可潘了！
    萨可潘因为地势高（海拔八百公尺），空气好，是个疗养肺病的好地方。这儿的疗养院有三千左右床位，而且拥有在欧洲享有名望的治疗肺病的医生。
    自从波兰人民掌握了政权以来，萨可潘的一切私人疗养院等都收归国有了，这儿变成了劳动人民疗养和休假的好地方。从此，这个当地居民只有二万五千人的小城，每年就要接待一百万游客。
