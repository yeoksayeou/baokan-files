The Mass Line is a Treasure
—Zhang Xueqing, Party Branch Secretary of the Fifth Workshop of Qingdao Cigarette Factory, Consults with Everyone on Everything
　　Wang Chongxun
　　Zhang Xueqing, Party Branch Secretary of the Fifth Workshop of Qingdao Cigarette Factory, is very good at contacting the masses, consulting with them on everything, and doing meticulous and in-depth political and ideological work.
　　　　Profound Understanding
　　At the end of last year, the printing workshop of this factory undertook a batch of stationery printing tasks. The contract stipulated delivery before the Spring Festival, but the task was assigned to the workshop on December 25th. Based on the situation at the time, it was impossible to deliver the goods in five days, let alone even make the plates. Based on the lesson of the delayed delivery of cigarette boxes, Zhang Xueqing came to the printing team with this arduous task. After consulting with the workers, everyone was full of confidence and said, "As long as the plates are made by the 28th, we guarantee to complete the task." The workers in the cutting team said, "If we can print it by the 30th, we will complete the task ahead of schedule." After Zhang Xueqing roughly figured it out, he went to the key team for completing the task—the plate-making team. Originally, from the team leader to the workers, no one had the confidence to complete this task. When Zhang Xueqing revealed the "bottom line" and introduced the plans of other teams, the team leader couldn't hold back. Before Zhang Xueqing could open his mouth to discuss solutions with him, he took the lead and said, "Okay, I'll discuss it with everyone right away." In the team meeting, after a discussion, the workers' enthusiasm rose: "If we can't strive to be advanced, at least we can't become a 'bottleneck.'" An old worker said:
　　"Team leader, go and report! Just say that we will seize every second and definitely complete the plate-making by the 28th." Then, they further discussed measures to speed up the plate-making progress. As a result, they delivered the goods one day ahead of schedule with guaranteed quality and quantity.
　　Since then, every time a new and important task arrived, Zhang Xueqing always consulted with the masses first, and the masses always said, "Secretary Zhang, don't worry! It is the Party's task, and it is also our own task. We will definitely find a way to complete it." Zhang Xueqing summarized this experience: "The mass line is a 'treasure,' and nothing can be done without it." Therefore, he firmly established the concept of relying on the masses.
　　　　Holding "Zhuge Liang Meetings"
　　Once, both workshop directors of the printing workshop were away on business. Zhang Xueqing was not very familiar with production technology, and the task was very heavy at that time. What should he do? He thought, "It doesn't matter if I'm not familiar, I can rely on the masses!" So, he decided to consult with the management personnel first. At a small meeting, he solemnly said, "The directors are gone. Whether this show is good or not depends on us. Let's come up with ideas!" Although there were not many words, it caused a great response. People originally thought that they would just listen to the arrangements and do it. They did not expect that they would also have to help the leaders come up with ideas. Immediately, everyone felt that everyone was carrying the heavy burden, and they also had a responsibility. Especially Zhang Xizhi, felt that what Zhang Xueqing said was exceptionally fresh, pleasant, and touching. He felt that since the Party trusted him so much, he must repay the Party's trust with the attitude of a master. He took the lead in expressing his opinion and proposed a method for completing the plan. Zhang Xueqing expressed his support on the spot. Zhang Xizhi was extremely happy. Early the next morning, he came to the workshop, first arranged the work, took time out to solicit business, and often went deep into the masses to solicit opinions and study how to improve printing quality. He also worked hard to study and came up with many ways to ensure the task was completed on time. Therefore, he was successively rated as an advanced producer twice.
　　Zhang Xueqing discovered that some printing presses had problems: uneven color mixing, paper fluff, water spots, and batch after batch of good paper turned into piles of waste.
　　He went to visit veteran workers and held "Zhuge Liang" meetings to solve the quality and quantity problems of printing. The participants in the "Zhuge Liang" meetings were machine operators and experienced veteran workers. Zhang Xueqing explained his intention, and Jia Yunsheng, the operator of machine No. 1, spoke first:
　　"We can start the machine five minutes earlier now." This sentence immediately aroused everyone's interest. Everyone chimed in and said:
　　"Great! Then please tell us about your experience in starting the machine early!" Jia Yunsheng explained his method, and then everyone discussed it one after another. This meeting lasted for two and a half days. The Party branch, based on the "wise plans" of these "Zhuge Liang," summarized a "uniform ink and water rapid operation method." After this advanced operation method was promoted, the machine could be started ten minutes earlier. Then, it gradually became possible to start the machine as soon as work started. The printed products had no water spots or paper fluff, were clean and clear, and the loss rate was also greatly reduced. Even the test printing paper that used to be piled up and no one used became the most scarce thing. The workers unanimously praised: "The experience summary is very good, and the 'Zhuge Liang' meeting was even better."
　　Listening to the Words of "Backward" Workers
　　Liu Congxi, a 54-year-old veteran worker, worked conscientiously and was straightforward. If you convinced him, he would work with great energy. If you couldn't convince him, don't even think about doing things according to your opinions. After several plans were issued, he raised different opinions and especially liked to give opinions to the team leader. Therefore, the team leader thought this person was difficult to lead. The masses' comments on Liu Congxi were also different. Some said he "adhered to the truth and was selfless"; some said he "contaminated the whole pot with a drop of bad oil"; some said he was a "backward element" and should be "mobilized to struggle against him."
　　After Zhang Xueqing learned about this situation, he decided to talk to Liu Congxi himself and listen to his opinions. At first, Liu Congxi was very unnatural. After Zhang Xueqing's kind and friendly reception, Liu Congxi's concerns were eliminated. Zhang Xueqing asked him to give opinions to the leaders. Liu Congxi was very excited and said: "Working is for the country and also for ourselves. Who doesn't want to do well! But to really do well, it can't just be simply you assign and I do. We should consult with the workers... We don't do enough in this regard, and I have opinions. But I get criticized as soon as I raise them." Zhang Xueqing thought his opinion was very correct. Liu Congxi suddenly felt warm in his heart and ran back to the team happily.
　　A few days later, the Party branch committee studied Liu Congxi's opinion and mobilized each team to discuss the plan. This approach made Liu Congxi especially happy. As soon as he saw Zhang Xueqing coming, he shouted loudly, "Secretary Zhang, come! Join our team's discussion!" As soon as Zhang Xueqing sat down, he continued to speak:
　　"My potential is great," he calculated the details and continued, "It is completely no problem to increase the cardboard boxes we make from the planned 26 per hour to more than 29 and a half." After discussion, all the workers in the team thought his opinion was practical and feasible and expressed their approval.
　　This is how Zhang Xueqing relied on the masses, mobilized the masses, did a good job of ideological work, and completed the production tasks.

    群众路线是个宝
    ——青岛卷烟厂第五车间党支部书记张学清事事和大家商量
    王崇训
    青岛卷烟厂第五车间党支部书记张学清，很善于联系群众，遇事同群众商量，政治思想工作做得细致深入。
          深刻的体会
    去年年底，这个工厂的印刷车间，承印了一批加工信笺的任务，合同规定年前交货，但任务下达到车间，已经是12月25日了。根据当时的情况，五天时间，不用说交货，连版都制不出来。张学清根据承印卷烟盒延期交货的教训，带着这个艰巨的任务来到了印刷组。和工人一商量，大家都信心很足，说：“只要28日制出版来，我们保证完成任务。”切裁组的工人表示：“30日前能印出来，我们提前完成任务。”张学清大体摸到个数以后，就到完成任务的关键组——制版组去。原来这个组，从组长到工人都没信心完成这个任务，当张学清交了“底”，介绍了其他组的打算以后，组长沉不住气了。还没有等张学清开口和他商量办法，他就迎头先说：“好，我马上和大家研究一下。”小组会上一讨论，工人们干劲上来了：“咱们争不上先进，起码也不能成了‘挡头’。”老工人说：
  “组长去汇报吧！就说分秒必争，28日一定制完版。”接着，进一步讨论了加快制版进度的措施，结果，提前一天按质按量交了货。
    从此以后，每一次新的重要任务到来后，张学清总是先和群众商量，群众也总是说：“张书记，你放心吧！是党的任务，也是我们自己的任务，我们一定想法完成。”张学清概括了这个经验：“群众路线是个‘宝’，什么事都离不了。”所以，他牢固地树立了依靠群众的观念。
      开“诸葛亮会”
    有一次，印刷车间的两个车间主任都出差了，张学清对生产技术不大熟悉，而当时任务又很重，怎么办呢？他想：“不熟悉不要紧，依靠群众嘛！”他就决定先和管理人员商量商量。在小会上，他郑重地说：“主任走了，这台戏唱好唱不好，就看咱们的了，大家出出主意吧！”话虽不多，引起的反响却很大。人们原来以为听听布置，干就是了，没想到还要帮领导出主意。顿时，都觉得千斤担子众人挑，自己也有一份责任。特别是张锡芝，感到张学清说的话异常新鲜、中听、动人，觉得党这样相信自己，自己必须以主人翁的态度报答党的信任。他抢先发表意见，提出了完成计划的办法。张学清当场表示支持。张锡芝高兴极了。第二天一早，他就来到车间，先把工作安排好，抽出时间出去揽活，并经常深入群众，征求意见，研究改进印刷质量。他还刻苦钻研，想出了很多办法，保证按期完成了任务。因此，先后两次被评为先进生产者。
    张学清发现了有些印刷机有问题：调色不匀，带纸毛，沾水花，一打一打的好纸，变成了一堆一堆的废品。
    他就去访问老工人，开“诸葛亮”会来解决印刷的质量和数量问题。参加“诸葛亮会”的是机长和有经验的老工人。张学清把意图一讲，一号车机长贾运声首先开腔：
  “我们现在上班五分钟就能开车。”这句话立即引起了大家的兴趣。七嘴八舌地一齐说：
  “好！那就请你拉拉为什么能早开车的经验吧！”贾运声讲了他的办法，接着大家你一言我一语地讨论了起来。这个会整整座谈了两个半天。支部根据这些“诸葛亮”们的
  “锦囊妙计”，总结出了一个“摆墨匀水快速操作法”。这个先进的操作法推广后，上班十分钟都能开车了。接着，逐步地做到了上班就开车，印出的成品，无水花、纸毛，干净清晰，损耗率也大大降低了。连过去堆着没人用的试印纸，现在也成了最稀罕的东西，工人们一致赞扬；“经验总结很好，‘诸葛亮会’开得更好。”
  听“落后”工人的话
    五十四岁的老工人刘从喜，干活认真，心直口快。你说服了他，他干的满带劲；你说不服他，就别想按着你的意见办事。几次下达计划后，他都提出不同意见，特别爱给组长提意见。因此，组长认为这人不好领导。群众对刘从喜的评论也不一样，有的说他“坚持真理，大公无私”；有的说他“一块坏油沾的满锅腥”；有的说他是“落后分子”，应该“发动群众斗他一下”。
    张学清了解到这个情况后，决定亲自和刘从喜谈话，听听他的意见。开头，刘从喜很不自然，在张学清的和蔼亲切接待后，刘从喜的顾虑消除了。张学清要求他给领导提意见，刘从喜的心情很激动，说：“干活都是给国家同时也是给自己干的，谁还不愿干好！但要真正干好，就不能光是简单地你布置我干，应该和工人商量商量，……咱们这点做的不够，我有意见。可我一提就挨批评。”张学清认为他的意见很对。刘从喜一听，骤然感到心窝热乎乎的，高兴地跑回小组去了。
    不几天，支部委员会研究了刘从喜的意见，发动各个小组都讨论计划。这个作法，特别使刘从喜高兴。他一看到张学清走来，就大声喊：“张书记，来！参加我们小组的讨论吧！”张学清刚坐下，他接着发言：
  “我的潜力很大”，他算了细账以后，继续说：“咱做的纸箱，从计划每小时二十六个提高到二十九个半以上，完全没有问题。”经过讨论，全组的工人都认为他的意见切实可行，表示赞成。
    张学清就是这样地依靠群众，发动群众，作好了思想工作，完成了生产任务。
