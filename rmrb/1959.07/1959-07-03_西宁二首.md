Two Poems of Xining
Zhang Yongmei

    On the right side of the small alley in Xining, a row of small adobe houses, cloaked in the dust of the plateau. Doors closed, windows shut, with large characters written on the doors: Demolish! Demolish! On the left side, a row of scaffolding, electric sparks blooming in all directions. Competition flags, dancing in the wind, loudspeakers, singing songs: Construction! Construction! The old – demolish! The new – construct! Tomorrow's alley will be a socialist avenue!

    The girl of Lusha’er who unveiled her head covering, has taken off her black veil, walking on the avenue: I want to see the poplar forest, I want to see the new high-rise buildings, the *malan* flowers are so beautiful, the *sha zao* branches smile and nod. Looking at the bright and shining avenue, I will never stumble again, and when I meet a pleasant young man, I won’t need to peek secretly from under the corner of my cloth. Colored sunlight, shine on my face! I want to face you, walk forward, and hold my head high!

(Note) After the democratic reform, most women are unwilling to walk with their faces covered.

    西宁二首
    张永枚
    西宁小巷右边一排小土屋，披一身高原尘土。关了门，闭了户，门上写大字：拆除！拆除！左边一排脚手架，电光四射开花朵。竞赛旗，迎风舞，扩音器，唱着歌：建筑！建筑！破旧的——拆除！崭新的——建筑！明天的小巷，是社会主义的大路！
    揭去盖头鲁沙尔的少女，揭去了黑色的盖头，在大路上行走：我要看那白杨林，我要看那新高楼，马兰花多么鲜美，沙枣枝含笑点头。眼望明光光的大路，再不会摔跟斗，遇上可意的少年人，用不着掀开布角偷偷瞅。彩色的阳光啊，洒在我脸上吧！我要迎着你，向前走，高高扬起头！（注）民主改革以后，大多数妇
      女都不愿用蒙面走路了。
