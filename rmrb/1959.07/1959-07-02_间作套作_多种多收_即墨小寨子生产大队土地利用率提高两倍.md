Jinan, July 1st (Our Dispatch) How to open up avenues for increased production in densely populated plains with limited land? The experience of the Xiaozhaizi Production Brigade of Chengyang People's Commune in Jimo County, Shandong Province, proves that continuous technical reform and the implementation of intercropping and relay cropping are good ways to improve land utilization and yield per unit area.

Xiaozhaizi is a production team with more than 2,900 mu of cultivated land and more than 2,100 people, with an average of just over 1.3 mu of land per person. With limited land, the only way is to achieve high yields, that is, to implement intercropping and relay cropping to fully utilize the land potential to achieve increased production. As early as the period of the elementary agricultural producers' cooperative, this production brigade began to experiment with and gradually expand the area of intercropping and relay cropping, and increase the multiple cropping index. Now, the team's farming methods of two crops and two harvests a year, three crops and three harvests, three crops and two harvests, and four crops and three harvests have completely replaced the old farming methods of one crop and one harvest a year and three crops and three harvests in two years that have been customary throughout history. Among them, the land managed by the methods of two crops and two harvests, three crops and two harvests, and three crops and three harvests a year accounts for the vast majority.

The team's method of multiple planting and multiple harvesting is: two crops and two harvests a year, planting corn after harvesting wheat, and planting wheat again after harvesting corn; three crops and two harvests a year, first planting early-maturing potatoes in winter fields, interplanting corn before the potatoes have all emerged, and planting wheat in the next crop; three crops and three harvests are spring potatoes interplanted with corn, and then planting cabbage in the next crop; four crops and three harvests are spring potatoes interplanted with corn, harvesting potatoes between the summer solstice and the minor heat, and continuously planting autumn potatoes before the beginning of autumn, and planting wheat after harvesting corn. Practical experience shows that this practice of continuous cropping and continuous harvesting, which increases the multiple cropping index, makes the use value of the team's more than 2,900 mu of land equivalent to twice the original, thus effectively alleviating the situation of having many people and little land and insufficient land for cultivation.

With the increase of land utilization rate, the yield per unit area is also increased at the same time. In 1958, the average grain yield per mu of this team reached as high as 674 jin, nearly three and a half times higher than the yield per mu obtained from one crop and one harvest a year or three crops and three harvests in two years in 1949; in addition, some cash was also earned due to intercropping cabbage and other vegetables.

The implementation of intercropping and relay cropping requires corresponding material and technical conditions. First of all, it is necessary to grasp the timing and plant without missing the farming season, otherwise the crops will affect each other's growth, which is not conducive to increased production. Therefore, water conservancy construction is very important, only in this way can we get rid of the threat of drought without affecting sowing. The Xiaozhaizi Brigade has dug a total of more than 650 deep wells in the past few years, turning dry land into irrigated land.

Secondly, fertilizer must keep up. In the past few years, this brigade has raised a large number of pigs, fermented green manure, and accumulated and manufactured a large amount of native miscellaneous fertilizer, ensuring that each mu of land is fertilized with more than 10,000 jin.

Thirdly, with water and fertilizer conditions in place, the selection of fine varieties and technical guidance cannot be ignored. The team now uses excellent varieties for whatever crop it plants. In intercropping and relay cropping, they pay special attention to mastering the organic combination of early-maturing crops and late-maturing crops, and the appropriate combination of tall-stem crops and short-stem crops to facilitate crop growth. According to the experience of the Xiaozhaizi Production Team, the earlier the potato varieties mature, the better when spring potatoes are intercropped with corn, and the later the corn matures, the better; corn and potatoes, or corn and sweet potatoes are also very good for intercropping, the benefit is that it is easy to manage and grow.

When the reporter visited Xiaozhaizi not long ago, it was the busy season of summer. The spring corn, which was as tall as the head, was lush and sturdy; in these cornfields, there were also ridges of potatoes, whose good development had cracked the topsoil with deep seams, and some had already begun to be harvested, with an estimated yield of as much as 2,000 jin. The good harvest of spring potatoes and winter wheat made the commune members burst with joy, and they are working hard to harvest, plant, and control pests to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn crops.

### 间作套作　多种多收  即墨小寨子生产大队土地利用率提高两倍

    间作套作　多种多收
    即墨小寨子生产大队土地利用率提高两倍
    本报济南1日电　在地少人多的平原地带，如何开拓增产门路？山东即墨县城阳人民公社小寨子生产大队的经验证明，不断进行技术改革、实行间作套作，是提高土地利用率和单位面积产量的好办法。
    小寨子是一个拥有二千九百多亩耕地、二千一百多人的生产队，每人平均仅一亩三分多地。土地少，唯一的办法是要土地高产，即实行间作套作，充分利用土地潜力，以达到增产的目的。早在初级农业生产合作社的时候，这个生产大队就开始试行并且逐步扩大间作套作面积，提高复种指数。现在，这个队一年两作两收、三作三收、三作两收和四作三收的耕作方法，已经完全代替了历来惯行的一年一作一收和二年三作三收的旧耕作方法。其中用一年两作两收、三作两收、三作三收方法经营的土地，占绝大部分。
    这个大队多作多收的方法是：一年两作两收的，是在收获小麦后种玉米，玉米收获后再种小麦；一年三作两收的是在冬地里首先种植早熟的土豆，土豆出齐苗之前套种上玉米，下一茬再种小麦；三作三收是春土豆套种玉米，下茬种白菜；四作三收是春土豆套种玉米，夏至、小暑之间收获土豆，立秋前连种秋土豆，玉米收获后种小麦。实际情况表明，这种连作连收，提高复种指数的作法，使得全队二千九百多亩地的使用价值相当于原来的两倍，因而人多地少土地不足耕种的情况，得到了有效的缓和。
    随着土地利用率的提高，单位面积产量也同时提高了。1958年这个队平均每亩产粮食高达六百七十四斤，较1949年一作一收或二年三作三收所获得的亩产量提高近三倍半；另外因间作白菜等菜类，还收入一部分现金。
    实行间作套作，需要有相适应的物质条件和技术条件。首先要掌握火候，下种不误农时，否则作物就会相互影响生长，不利增产。因此兴修水利很重要，只有这样才能摆脱干旱威胁，而不致影响播种。小寨子大队几年来共打了六百五十多眼深井，变旱田为水浇地。
    其次，肥料必须跟上。这个大队几年来大量养猪、沤积绿肥，大积大造土杂肥，保证了每亩土地施肥一万斤以上。
    第三，水肥条件具备了，良种选择、技术指导工作也不可忽视。这个队现在无论种植的那一种作物，都采用优良品种。在间作套作中，他们特别注意掌握早熟作物和晚熟作物有机配合，高秆作物和矮秆作物适当搭配，以利作物生长。根据小寨子生产队的经验，春土豆间作玉米，土豆品种越早熟的越好，而玉米以熟的晚些为宜；玉米和土豆，或玉米和地瓜间作也很好，好处是便于管理和生长。
    记者不久前来到小寨子访问的时候，正逢夏忙时节。高及头顶的春玉米葱绿茁壮；就在这些玉米地里，还长着一垅垅的土豆，它的良好发育已使表土裂开了深缝，有的已开始收刨，估产达两千斤之多。春土豆、冬小麦的良好收成，喜得社员心花怒放，正以加倍的劲头忙打忙收忙种忙治虫，争取大秋作物丰产。
