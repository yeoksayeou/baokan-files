    The Inspiring "Green Prairie Red Flag"
    Feng Hou
    The Peking Opera "Green Prairie Red Flag," performed by the Qinghai Peking Opera Troupe, truthfully reflects the struggle and victory of the Tibetan herdsmen on the Qinghai grasslands, under the leadership of the Party, to overthrow the feudal serf system and establish a socialist system, against the reactionary elements of the upper class. The play exposes the reactionary elements of the upper class in a stark manner. The Living Buddha, draped in a large red kasaya and fingering Buddhist beads, and the herd owner and chieftain who is also the deputy county chief of the People's Government, turn out to be deeply hidden and utterly reactionary figures. Under the guise of religion and government cadres, they collude secretly with the Kuomintang. Reactionaries use the chains that have long bound the herdsmen's spirits, riding roughshod over the people, doing whatever they please, undermining democratic reforms and the socialist revolution. But the wheels of history cannot be turned back, as the Communist Party member Angjia says to the herd owner Jibeng: "The yellow riding jacket is a thing of the Qing Dynasty; now it is the Communist Party that leads." Under the leadership and education of the Party, and in the course of actual struggle, the herdsmen finally recognize that these fellows are a bunch of boils that must be squeezed out, thereby strengthening their confidence in moving towards socialism. Red flags flutter on the grassland, and the slaves liberated from their chains dance and sing wildly. The spring of the Tibetan people has arrived! The Tibetan people have been reborn! When we see such a picture in the Peking Opera "Green Prairie Red Flag," how can we not feel excited and moved!
    The reason why "Green Prairie Red Flag" is inspiring is because it is expressed through strong dramatic tension and vivid character images. The contradiction between progress and reaction, democracy and anti-democracy, runs through the play to the end, but the unfolding of the contradiction is not a flat narrative, but rather has layers, development, detours, and twists and turns, so it can grip the audience's heartstrings and be captivating step by step. For example, Angjia, the Party member who was sent back to his hometown to establish a cooperative, was framed by chieftain Jibeng and escaped nine years ago. This time, as soon as he returns, Jibeng wants to fabricate charges to put Angjia to death. Just as Angjia is about to be pushed into the raging fire, when the situation is extremely critical, someone suddenly shouts: "Stop!" County Party Secretary Duowang stands tall in the crowd. At this time, Jibeng's power takes a sharp turn for the worse. Secretary Duowang further questions Jibeng about why he kidnapped Zhuoma. This Deputy County Chief Jibeng, in desperation, wants to use threats to dump all the blame on the mastermind, Ke Ba. Who knew that his herdsman Ribu would stand up at this time and reveal his true colors, saying that he had beaten Zhuoma severely and locked her in the sheepfold. Only then was Jibeng speechless. The play seems to have come to an end here; however, at this moment, a Kuomintang bandit wearing a kasaya suddenly fires a shot at Secretary Duowang, and the contradiction is further deepened, developed, and also becomes more complicated. This play truly goes deeper step by step, peeling away layers, with surging waves and unexpected peaks. It tightly grabs the audience, leading them step by step to a newer and higher realm.
    Several characters in "Green Prairie Red Flag" are portrayed very well. Suonan is a very lovable young Tibetan fellow, who has a clear sense of love and hate, is forthright and straightforward, and is quick to accept new things. This is a very valuable character trait among Tibetan youth, and it is also a character with typical significance.
    Secretary Duowang first meets the audience at the moment when Angjia is about to be pushed into the fire by Jibeng. This is truly an unusual appearance. As soon as he comes out, he is at the sharpest point of the contradiction. From his first appearance until the end of the play, he is always the central figure in the contradiction; this is different from those leaders who stand outside the contradiction and come on stage only to solve problems. Therefore, he can leave a relatively deep impression on people.
    The play creates an image of a young lama who has suffered all kinds of mental torture and imprisonment to the point that he cannot extricate himself. Under the threat of the Living Buddha Gongbao, in order to save his mother, he is forced to admit that he was the murderer who shot Secretary Duowang. After repeated enlightenment and education by Secretary Duowang and Angjia, he finally tells the truth. Several passages of "Erhuang Yuanban" truly sing out his inner pain and the fierce struggle in his mind, which is very infectious. His experience aroused great sympathy from the audience. So when he and his mother join the cooperative together and are reborn from then on, the audience wholeheartedly blesses him.
    The play does not use simplistic methods to deal with the negative image. The insidious, vicious, and cunning nature of the reactionary Living Buddha Gongbao of the Dawu Temple is portrayed with considerable weight; if his hypocritical side could be portrayed further, this image would be more complete and persuasive.
    "Green Prairie Red Flag" has made great achievements in the use of tradition. For example, the arrangement of singing styles, Angjia's "tang ma" (a type of acrobatic horse riding movement) and the "wuchou" (clown) recitative, and Ke Ba's "diao mao" (a type of acrobatic movement), "zou bian" (a type of stage movement), and "zou aizi" (walking like a dwarf) are all used very appropriately. What is particularly worth mentioning is that it does not set up fighting scenes for the sake of martial arts, but rather sets up fighting scenes according to the needs of the plot. For example, the fight between Angjia and Ke Ba at the water conservancy construction site in the dark night is a very well-designed scene, and it is also very appropriate to use gunshots instead of fighting at the end.
    The natural scenery of the Qinghai grasslands, the architecture of the temples, and the customs and habits of the Tibetan people add a rich color to this play. However, for some cumbersome places, there is no need to force uniformity and insist on having scenery. For example, the wall in Secretary Duowang's office could be considered unnecessary. In addition, the entire play is not refined enough, and the characters are not economical enough. It is believed that it will continue to be improved in performance.
    "Green Prairie Red Flag" is an inspiring play, and its performance further proves the rich expressive power of the Peking Opera tradition. In 1958, some relatively successful modern plays emerged on the Peking Opera stage, which caused a sensation for a while. These plays could be performed regularly as repertory plays. But later they disappeared without a trace and have not been performed since. During the Great Leap Forward, there was a tendency to despise traditional plays, which should be corrected; but good modern plays should continue to be performed, and even better modern plays should emerge.

    激动人心的“绿原红旗”
    冯厚
    青海省京剧团来京演出的“绿原红旗”，真实地反映了青海草原上藏族牧民在党的领导下，为推翻封建农奴制度、建立社会主义制度，同上层反动分子进行的斗争和胜利。戏里对上层反动分子作了赤裸裸的揭露。披着大红袈裟、手捻佛珠的活佛，身为人民政府副县长的牧主兼头人，原来是暗藏的、反动透顶的家伙。他们打着宗教和政府干部的幌子，暗中勾结国民党，反动派利用长期以来锁在牧民精神上的锁链，骑在人民头上，为所欲为，破坏民主改革和社会主义革命。但历史的车轮是不能倒转的，正如共产党员昂加对牧主吉朋说的：“黄马褂是清朝的事，现在是共产党领导。”牧民在党的领导教育下，在实际斗争中，终于认清了这些家伙是一群非挤出去不可的脓疮，从而也更坚定了走向社会主义的信心。草原上红旗招展，从锁链下解放出来的奴隶狂舞高歌，藏族人民的春天来到了！藏族人民获得新生了！当我们从京剧“绿原红旗”中看到这样的图画时，怎么能不感到兴奋和激动呢！
      “绿原红旗”之所以激动人心，是由于它是通过强烈的戏剧性和鲜明的人物形象表现出来的。剧中进步与反动，民主与反民主的矛盾贯穿到底，但矛盾的展开不是平铺直叙，而是有层次、有发展、有迂回、有曲折，所以能扣住观众的心弦，步步引人入胜。如被党派回家乡建立合作社的党员昂加，他是九年前被吉朋头人陷害而逃走的，这次他刚刚回来，吉朋就要捏造罪名置昂加于死地，正当要把昂加推入熊熊大火，情势非常危急时，突然有人大喝一声：“慢着！”县委书记多旺屹立在人群中了。这时吉朋的威风急转直下，多旺书记进一步追问吉朋为什么抓走卓玛，这位副县长吉朋情急无奈，便想用威胁手段把这个屎盆子全部扣到主谋者克巴头上，谁知这时他的牧工日布站出来揭了他的底，说他将卓玛毒打后，锁在羊圈里，这时吉朋才哑口无言，戏到这里似乎是告一段落了；然而就在这时穿着袈裟的国民党匪徒突然向多旺书记开了一枪，于是矛盾进一步深化了，发展了，而且也更加复杂了。这场戏真是步步深入、层层剥开、波澜起伏、异峰突起，它紧紧抓住观众，一步步把观众带上更新更高的境界。
      “绿原红旗”有几个人物刻划得很出色。索南是一个非常可爱的藏族青年小伙子，他爱憎分明，刚直爽快，易于接受新鲜事物，这是藏族青年中非常可贵的性格，同时也是一个具有典型意义的性格。
    多旺书记第一次和观众见面是在昂加正要被吉朋推入火堆烧死的当口，这真是一个不平常的出场，他一出来就处于矛盾的最尖端。从第一次上场直到戏结束，他一直是矛盾中的中心人物；这就和那些站在矛盾之外的，专为解决问题而上场的领导者形象有所不同。因此，他能给人留下比较深刻的印象。
    剧中创造了一个在精神上受尽种种折磨、禁锢以至于不能自拔的青年喇嘛形象。他在活佛公保的威胁下，为了拯救自己的母亲，被迫承认自己是向多旺书记开枪的凶手，经过多旺书记和昂加再三启发教育，他才讲出真情，几段二黄原板真实地唱出了他内心的痛苦和思想上剧烈的斗争，有很强的感染力。他的遭遇引起观众的极大同情。所以当他和他母亲一起参加合作社，从此获得新生时，观众又衷心地为他祝福。
    剧中并没用简单化的办法处理反面形象，达乌寺反动活佛公保的阴险毒辣、老奸巨滑刻划得很有分量；假如再能刻划出他伪善的一面，这个形象就会更丰满，更有说服力。
    “绿原红旗”在传统的运用上有很大成绩，如唱腔的安排，昂加的趟马和武丑念白，克巴的吊毛、走边、走矮子等运用得都很得体。特别值得一提的是，它没有因武功而设开打，而是根据情节需要而设开打，如黑夜在水利工地昂加与克巴的那一场搏斗就是非常精当的设计，而在最后结束用枪声而不用开打也很恰当。
    青海草原上的自然景色，寺庙的建筑，藏族的风俗习尚为此剧增添了浓郁的色彩。但有些显得累赘的地方，也不必强求统一，非有布景不可，如多旺书记办公室的那堵墙就可考虑不要。此外，整个戏还不够精炼，人物也不够经济，相信在演出中会不断得到改进。
    “绿原红旗”是一出激动人心的戏，它的演出更加证明了京剧传统的丰富表现力。1958年在京剧舞台上涌现了一些比较成功的现代戏，曾哄动一时，这些戏是可以作为保留剧目定期上演的。但到后来却消声敛迹，未见上演过。在大跃进中出现过轻视传统戏的倾向，这是应当纠正的；但好的现代戏仍应继续上演，并且应该有更好的现代戏出现。
