Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th - The first phase of the Fenhe Reservoir project - the flood control project, located in JingLe County, upstream of Shanxi's Fen River, was successfully completed on the 12th. The forty-meter-high flood control dam cuts across the Fen River, and for the first time, the roaring river flows downstream through tunnels according to people's arrangements. From now on, Taiyuan City and the farmlands and cities along the Fen River will be free from the threat of upstream floods; all floods in the 5,300-plus square kilometer area upstream of the Fen River will be controlled. The Fen River is the largest river in Shanxi Province and the second largest tributary of the Yellow River. The Fenhe Reservoir is a major project for harnessing the Fen River and an important tributary reservoir for harnessing the Yellow River. For thousands of years, the Fen River has caused great disasters to the people along its banks. According to relevant historical records, since 1603, there has been a flood approximately every five years and a partial change of course every twenty years. The completion of this reservoir will fundamentally end this suffering history of the Fen River basin. The reservoir can store 700 million cubic meters of floodwater, which, in addition to meeting the industrial water needs of Taiyuan City, can also irrigate 1.3 million mu of farmland on the Jinzhong Plain.
    In 1952, Shanxi Province decided to build the Fenhe Reservoir in Xiashijiazhuang, JingLe County. After several years of preparation, construction began in July last year. According to the plan, the Fenhe Reservoir project consists of four major parts: an earth dam, a spillway, tunnels, and a power station. The earth dam is the main body of the reservoir project. A spillway is opened along the mountaintop at the south end of the earth dam, and the tunnels are carved through the mountain at the south end of the dam. The power station is closely connected to the tunnels and is designed to have a power generation capacity of 8,300 kilowatts. The entire project is carried out in two phases. The first phase includes the dam and the tunnels. Now, after a year of labor by more than 40,000 migrant workers, the dam has reached a height of forty meters, and the tunnels can smoothly drain water.
    Here, the workers brilliantly applied the Soviet Union's advanced dam construction method - the "underwater dumping" method in dam construction. The use of this method greatly accelerated the construction progress of the flood control dam and saved a lot of money compared to using concrete, compaction, and other methods. Currently, the second phase of the reservoir project has begun.

    汾河水库胜利拦洪
    太原市和汾河沿岸摆脱洪水威胁
    新华社太原15日电　山西汾河上游静乐县境内的汾河水库第一期工程——拦洪工程，已于12日胜利完工。四十米高的拦洪大坝拦腰切断了汾河，奔腾咆哮的河水第一次按照人们的安排，经过隧洞流向下游。从此，太原市和汾河沿岸的田园、城市，摆脱了上游洪水的威胁；汾河上游五千三百多平方公里流域面积内的洪水，全部被控制了。汾河是山西境内第一大河，也是黄河的第二大支流。汾河水库是治理汾河的一项主要工程，也是治理黄河的一个重要的支流水库。汾河几千年来给沿岸人民很大祸害，据有关史料记载，1603年以来，它大约每五年有一次水灾，每二十年有一次局部改道。这个水库的建成将从根本上结束汾河流域这部苦难的历史。这个水库可以拦蓄七亿立方米的洪水，这些洪水除可满足太原市工业用水外，还能灌溉晋中平原一百三十万亩田地。
    1952年，山西省决定在静乐县的下石家庄兴建汾河水库，经过几年筹备，去年7月开工。按照规划，汾河水库工程是由四大部分组成的，即：土坝、溢洪道、隧洞和发电站。土坝是水库工程的主体，土坝南端沿山顶开有一条溢洪道，隧洞是在坝的南端穿山开凿的。发电站紧连隧洞，设计发电能力为八千三百瓩。全部工程分两期进行，第一期工程包括拦河坝和隧洞。现在，经过四万多民工一年的劳动，坝高已达到四十米，隧洞已能顺利排水。
    这里的劳动者们，在筑坝中，出色地运用了苏联的先进筑坝方法——“水中倒土”法，采用这种方法使拦洪坝的施工进度大大加快了，而且比采用混凝土、碾压等方法，少花了许多钱。目前，水库的第二期工程已经开工。
