Seize the Season, Harvest Well
Houshi Brigade Adopts Eight Measures to Ensure Fine and Detailed Early Rice Harvesting

Changsha, July 15th (Our Dispatch) - The Houshi Brigade of the Liantang'ao Commune in You County, Hunan Province, pays close attention to fine harvesting in the early rice harvest.

The brigade has 2,629 mu of early rice. As of the 9th, 378 mu had been harvested. When early rice harvesting began, brigade cadres went deep into the work groups to check the quality of harvesting. They observed that commune members were strictly following the original operating procedures: not missing a single plant when cutting, not losing a single ear during transportation, and not wasting a single grain during threshing. The fields, rice stalks, and threshing grounds were very clean, with very few lost grains of rice. Such meticulous harvesting was rare in the past.

The reason why this brigade is doing a good job in fine harvesting is primarily due to the strengthening of ideological education for commune members. Before the rush harvest and planting, the brigade party branch launched the masses to summarize the experiences and lessons of fine harvesting last year and discuss how to bring back all the grain from the bumper harvest. At the beginning, some people said, "Where salt is produced, people walk on salt; in a bumper year, grain is lost in the fields," believing that it didn't matter if a few grains were lost in a bumper year. Some commune members also felt that time was tight, and talking about fine harvesting would make it difficult to seize the season; seizing the season would inevitably lead to the loss of a few grains. The brigade party branch then led the commune members in a discussion, starting with a summary of last year's experiences and lessons, and specifically calculating the accounts. Last year, due to incomplete tool preparation, improper personnel arrangements, and harvesting too early, it was estimated that an average of about 30 jin of rice was wasted per mu. Through accounting, the commune members realized that losing some grains casually was not a trivial matter, but a matter related to whether the bumper harvest could actually be a successful harvest. As for the fear that focusing on quality would prevent seizing the season, everyone also specifically calculated the labor accounts, believing that as long as the work was arranged well, it was entirely possible to seize the season. After unifying their thinking, the brigade repeatedly discussed with the commune members and adopted the following measures to ensure fine and detailed harvesting:

First, grasp the maturity period and arrange the harvesting sequence. Last year, this aspect was not well grasped; some rice was already shedding grains but hadn't been harvested, while some was not fully mature but was harvested early. This year, based on the old farmers' experience of "harvesting when the grain is 90% mature" and the maturity of various varieties, they decided to harvest Liuyang early rice from July 5th to 12th and Nantao No. 1 from July 13th to 20th, harvesting as it ripened, one field at a time.

Second, rationally arrange labor, ensuring that the labor for cutting, threshing, transporting, and drying is evenly distributed and tightly linked, so that cutting, threshing, transporting, and drying are done simultaneously, without letting the grain stay in the field overnight.

Third, strictly follow the operating procedures. They stipulated: cutting should be done gently, placing the rice stalks lightly, cutting cleanly and evenly, cutting with the wind, not losing ears, not losing awns, and not cutting large bundles of rice. Threshing should be done gently, lifting and threshing carefully. When transporting, tools should be complete, not filled too full, and unstable bridges should be repaired.

Fourth, repair farm tools and drying grounds. Ensure that summer harvesting tools are complete and in good condition, with everyone having sickles, shoulder poles, and baskets, and no broken buckets, broken baskets, or broken mats. Six hundred pieces of summer harvesting tools that needed repair were organized by 25 handicraft workers, divided into five repair groups, and all repaired before harvesting.

Fifth, organize special ear-picking teams. All 1,500 primary school students and children in the brigade are responsible for picking up lost ears of wheat, ensuring that no ears are left in the fields. Picking up ears is credited to the team, and rewards are given for exceeding the quota.

Sixth, organize a protection team for fields near houses and roads. The brigade's 850 mu of fields near villages and roads, based on the original field management individual responsibility system, formed 32 protection teams with party members, League members, and activists as the backbone. Persuade commune members not to let livestock roam during the harvesting season, and herdsmen should ensure that they are not separated from their cattle and that the ropes are always in their hands. At the same time, measures such as tying up rice stalks and digging ditches are taken for the fields along the road to facilitate pedestrians and avoid trampling on the grains.

Seventh, do a good job in "five preventions" to protect the summer harvest. 125 party members, League members, agricultural technicians, and others in the brigade formed 28 grain protection teams to do a good job in preventing wind and rain, preventing poultry, preventing theft, preventing mildew, and preventing fire. It is required to grasp weather changes and rush to harvest and dry; every household has signed a fire prevention agreement, strictly prohibiting lighting fires and smoking in the granaries.

Eighth, strengthen leadership and establish a responsibility system. The six general branch committee members each oversee a production team, and 77 team cadres and party members oversee groups, with commune members implementing a "five determinations" (determining people, determining fields, determining quality, determining time, and determining work points) and a reward system for harvesting responsibilities. The brigade, production teams, and work groups have established inspection and acceptance teams, implementing daily inspections by work groups and inspections every five days by the brigade. At the same time, competitions are carried out between teams, groups, and individuals, inspecting and supervising each other to ensure the quality of harvesting.

### 抢住季节　快收收好  侯市大队采取八项措施保证早稻精收细打

    抢住季节　快收收好
    侯市大队采取八项措施保证早稻精收细打
    本报长沙15日电　湖南省攸县莲塘坳公社侯市大队在早稻收割中很注意细收细打。
    这个大队共有早稻二千六百二十九亩，到9日止已收割三百七十八亩。早稻开镰收割，大队干部便深入到作业组检查收割质量，只见社员们都严格按照原订的操作规程行动，割不丢棵，运不丢穗，扮不丢粒，田里、粒秆、晒谷坪都很干净，很少看到丢失的谷粒。他们复打了七百四十二把稻草，仅仅打出六斤多谷。这样细打精收在过去是很少见的。
    这个大队细收细打搞得好，首先是由于加强了对社员的思想教育。抢收抢种前夕，大队党总支便发动群众总结去年细收细打的经验教训，讨论怎样把丰产的粮食全部收回来。开始有人说：“出盐的地方盐抵脚，丰收年成田丢谷”，认为丰收了，丢几粒算不了什么；还有的社员认为时间很紧，讲得细收细打，就难得抢住季节；要抢住季节，就难免丢失几粒。大队党总支便领导社员进行了一次讨论，他们从总结去年的经验教训入手，具体算账。去年由于工具准备不齐，人员安排不当，加上收得过早，估计平均每亩浪费谷子三十斤左右。通过算账使社员认识到随便丢失一些，并不是小事，而是关系到丰产能不能丰收的大事。至于怕顾了质量便不能抢住季节，大家也具体算了劳力账，认为只要安排好工夫，完全可以抢住季节。统一思想以后，这个大队反复同社员商量，采取以下措施，保证细打细收。
    第一，掌握成熟期，安排收割顺序。去年这一环抓得不够好，有的老了脱粒，还没有收；而有的还不十分成熟，却又抢前收了。今年他们根据老农“粒到九成收”的经验和各种品种成熟先后，确定从7月5日开始到12日收割浏阳早，13日到20日收割南特号，做到随熟随收，熟一丘收一丘。
    第二，合理安排劳力，割、扮、运、晒各个环节的劳力搭配均匀，而又环环扣紧，做到边割边打边运边晒，不让谷子在田里过夜。
    第三，严格按照操作规程行事。他们规定：要轻割轻放，割净割齐，割顺风禾，不丢穗，不丢籼，不割大把禾。扮要轻举重扮。运的时候工具要齐备，装得不要太满，并修好不牢固的桥梁。
    第四，修理农具和晒场。做到夏收工具一崭齐，人人有禾镰、扁担、箩筐，做到无烂桶、无烂箩，无烂簟。需要修理的夏收工具六百件，组织二十五个手工业工人，分成五个修理小组，在收割前夕全部修好。
    第五，组织专门拾穗组。全队一千五百个小学生和儿童，负责拣回丢失的麦穗。做到田不丢穗。拾穗归队，定额记分，超额给奖励。
    第六，靠近屋场和路边田，组织保收小组。全队近村路边田八百五十亩，以原来的田间管理个人负责制为基础，以党团员、积极分子为骨干，组成了三十二个保收小组。说服社员收割期不放散家畜，牧牛员做到人不离牛，绳不离手。同时对路边的田采取扎禾、提沟等办法，方便行人，避免踩踏谷粒。
    第七，做好“五防”，保卫夏收。全队党员团员、农业技术员等一百二十五人，组成二十八个护粮小组，做好防风雨，防家禽，防盗窃，防霉烂，防火的五防工作。要求掌握天气变化，抢收抢晒；户户订防火公约，严禁在仓内打火吸烟。
    第八，加强领导，建立责任制。六个总支委员各包一个生产队，七十七个队干部、党员包组，社员实行“五定”（定人、定田、定质量、定时间、定工分）一奖的收割责任制。大队、生产队、作业组都建立了检查验收小组，实行作业组一日一检查，大队五日一检查。同时，队与队、组与组、人与人之间开展竞赛，互相检查督促，确保收割质量。
