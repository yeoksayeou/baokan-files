    The Secret to Cotton Fertilization is:
              "Observe the Sky, Observe the Land, Observe the Cotton"
    Fertilization has a great impact on the growth, development, yield, and quality of cotton plants. The role of fertilizer applied to cotton fields depends not only on the nature of the cotton plant itself but also on its living conditions, especially soil climate and agricultural techniques. Chinese farmers have extremely rich fertilization experience. Cotton planting experts Qu Yaoli and Zhang Qiuxiang both advocate that fertilization should "Observe the Sky, Observe the Land, Observe the Cotton." These simple seven characters vividly express the secret of cotton fertilization. This secret contains complex and rich scientific content and technical measures. It is not easy to truly learn to observe the sky, observe the land, and observe the cotton to achieve skillful fertilization. To observe the sky, one must be familiar with seasonal changes and weather factors such as temperature, rainfall, and sunshine. To observe the land, one must understand the types, textures, water and heat conditions, and fertility changes of cotton field soil. To observe the cotton, one must learn to talk to the cotton and understand when the cotton absorbs what nutrients, how much nutrients are needed, and the relationship between these nutrients and the growth and development of the cotton plant. Cotton cannot be separated from the specific conditions of the sky and the land. Observing the sky is not a simple understanding of the weather, but understanding the relationship between weather and cotton growth and development, and the impact of weather on soil characteristics based on understanding seasonal and weather changes. Similarly, observing the land must be linked to observing the sky and observing the cotton; observing the cotton must be unified with observing the sky and observing the land. The center of observing the sky, observing the land, and observing the cotton is observing the seedlings for fertilization. Summarizing the experience of farmers in observing the seedlings for fertilization requires not only mastering the methods and techniques, but more importantly, understanding the views and perspectives on observing the seedlings for fertilization. Using advanced scientific theories and existing research results is an important weapon for summarizing experience. We must combine scientific theory with farmers' high-yield experience to further improve high-yield experience and enrich scientific theory.

    Although observing cotton for fertilization cannot be separated from the special conditions of the local sky and land, as the physiological basis of fertilization, it has its general rules. To observe cotton, first, we must understand how cotton plants grow. Cotton plants grow from small to large, from light to heavy. The increase in cotton plant growth can be expressed by the accumulation of dry matter. In the life of a cotton plant, the accumulation of dry matter has a certain trend. From the emergence of cotton seedlings to the beginning of budding, the dry matter accumulated by the cotton plant accounts for about 5% of the final total amount of the entire growth period. After the beginning of budding, the cotton plant enters a period of relatively rapid accumulation of dry matter. From budding to the peak of flowering, about 24% of the total dry matter is accumulated. From the peak of flowering to the first boll cracking, about 65% is accumulated. From the first boll cracking to the end of the growing season, about 6% is accumulated. Of course, the accumulation of dry matter in each developmental stage of the cotton plant varies depending on the region, variety, and cultivation conditions. For example, varieties with long growing seasons and regions with longer growing seasons accumulate a larger proportion of dry matter from the first boll cracking to the end of the growing season.

    The accumulation of dry matter in cotton plants at different developmental stages only allows us to understand the general growth of the cotton plant and does not represent the absorption of nutrients. Generally speaking, the absorption of nutrients increases with the age of the cotton plant. Cotton plants absorb very few nutrients during the seedling stage, and then gradually increase. The absorption is greatest from the peak of flowering to the first boll cracking. Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers are the most important for cotton fertilization, and the problem of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization is also the most complex. According to the experimental results of the Soviet Cotton Research Institute in Tashkent, the nitrogen absorbed by cotton seedlings at the 2 to 3 true leaf stage accounts for only 0.25% of the total absorption during the entire growth period, and phosphorus (P2O5) accounts for 0.06%. From the 2 to 3 true leaf stage to before budding, nitrogen accounts for 10.20% and phosphorus accounts for 8.6%. From budding to the peak of flowering, nitrogen accounts for 29.20% and phosphorus accounts for 12.90%. From the peak of flowering to the first boll cracking, nitrogen accounts for 48.90% and phosphorus accounts for 59.60%. From the first boll cracking to the end of the growing season, nitrogen accounts for 11.40% and phosphorus accounts for 18.90%. It can be seen that the absorption of nitrogen and phosphorus by cotton plants is different. Before the cotton bolls open, the absorption of nitrogen is relatively higher than the absorption of phosphorus. After the cotton bolls open, the absorption of phosphorus is relatively higher than nitrogen. It must be pointed out that the absorption of nitrogen and phosphorus by cotton plants at different developmental stages varies depending on climate, soil, variety, and cultivation conditions.
      
      Cotton plants in different developmental stages
            require different nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition
    The nitrogen and phosphorus content of various organs of cotton plants has a certain variation pattern at different developmental stages. After cotton seedlings begin to absorb nutrients from the soil, the nitrogen and phosphorus content in the cotton plant slightly increases. The nitrogen and phosphorus content of the cotton plant reaches its highest level before budding. Thereafter, due to the vigorous growth of the cotton plant and the absorption of nutrients by reproductive organs, the nitrogen and phosphorus content in vegetative organs decreases. By the end of the growing season, more than 60% of the total nitrogen and phosphorus absorbed by the cotton plant in its lifetime is concentrated in the cottonseeds. The amount of nutrients absorbed by the cotton plant from the soil during its lifetime depends on the percentage of nitrogen and phosphorus content in the cotton plant, the weight of seed cotton, and the ratio of seed cotton to the weight of vegetative organs. The nutrients absorbed by cotton plants from the soil to produce 100 jin of seed cotton are approximately 2.8 to 7.1 jin of nitrogen and 1 to 2 jin of phosphorus (P2O5). The range of variation is very large. Although the yield of cotton per unit area is not directly proportional to the amount of nutrients absorbed, it can be inferred that the amount of fertilizer used in high-yielding cotton fields does not need to be excessive.

    Cotton plants require different nitrogen and phosphorus nutritional conditions at different developmental stages. Cotton seedlings hardly need to absorb nutrients from the soil within a few days after emergence. The period from seven to ten to fifteen to twenty days after cotton seedling emergence, that is, when the cotton seedlings have their first and second true leaves, is a critical period for nutrition. At this time, cotton seedlings have a particularly high requirement for phosphorus nutrition. If phosphorus is insufficient during this period, growth and development will be hindered, the position of fruiting branches will be raised, maturity will be delayed, and yield will be reduced. Cotton plants require the highest amount of phosphorus during the boll-forming stage. If phosphorus is insufficient at this time, it will increase boll shedding, hinder growth, lead to the production of unfilled cottonseeds, and affect the quality of seed cotton and seeds. Similarly, timely nitrogen nutrition is of great significance. Cotton plants must absorb a small but necessary amount of nitrogen seven to ten days after emergence. Nitrogen nutrition plays a very important role from 20 days after cotton seedling emergence to the first boll cracking. The highest absorption of nitrogen, like phosphorus, is also during the boll-forming stage of cotton plants. If cotton plants lack nitrogen in the early stages, the number of flower buds that appear will be limited. Although it can be remedied by applying nitrogen fertilizer later, the later the nitrogen supply, the later the peak of boll formation, the longer the time required from budding to flowering to boll opening, the increase in late-stage flower picking, and the reduction in total seed cotton yield. Conversely, if the nitrogen nutritional conditions of cotton plants are good in the early stage, but nitrogen is insufficient during the flowering and boll-forming stage, it cannot be guaranteed that there will be enough food to transport to the growing cotton bolls, increasing shedding and reducing boll weight. Generally speaking, the appropriate nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition is to ensure the supply of phosphorus seven to fifteen days or ten to twenty days after cotton seedling emergence, and start limiting the supply of nitrogen; to ensure the supply of nitrogen after 20 days; although it is also necessary to ensure the supply of nitrogen during the budding stage, a large amount of nitrogen is not required. The supply of nitrogen and phosphorus is required more during the flowering and boll-forming stage. This is an important basis for considering the type, amount, ratio, and timing of fertilizer application.

    Cotton plants must have sufficient nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition at different developmental stages. Nitrogen and phosphorus must have a certain ratio for cotton plants to carry out normal growth and development. In the case of insufficient phosphorus nutrition in cotton plants, nitrogen strengthens the growth of cotton plants and delays development. At this time, the nitrogen content of cotton plants increases, especially the content of mineral nitrogen. Cotton plants grow tall, raise the position of the first fruiting branch, increase leaf branches, increase the shedding of central fruiting organs, increase the ratio between vegetative organs and reproductive organs, reduce the amount of first flower picking and total yield, reduce fiber quality, reduce cotton seed germination rate, and also reduce the productivity of their offspring. In the case of insufficient nitrogen nutrition in cotton plants, nitrogen strengthens the growth of cotton plants in the early stage or before budding, accelerates the development of cotton plants and leads to the aging of organs. The phosphorus content of cotton plants under this nutritional condition increases, and the mineral phosphorus in each organ is particularly increased. Cotton plants are not tall, the position of fruiting branches is low, leaf branches are weakly developed, the shedding of bolls in the central part is small, boll formation stops earlier, the shedding of buds and bolls in the peripheral part of the cotton plant is high, the amount of first flower picking is high, the amount of late flower picking is low, the total yield is not high, the fiber length is shortened, and the sowing quality of cottonseeds is good. The ideal nitrogen and phosphorus nutritional condition is that both nitrogen and phosphorus are sufficient. At this time, there is no high accumulation of nitrogen or phosphorus alone in the cotton plant. The content of both organic substances relatively increases. The growth and development of cotton plants are normal, and the yield is high and the quality is good. However, if nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition is excessive, especially if nitrogen or phosphorus alone is excessive, it is extremely detrimental to the growth and development of cotton plants. If nitrogen alone is excessive in the seedling stage, the cotton seedlings have not yet formed a sufficient amount of carbohydrates at that time, which will lead to a large accumulation of non-protein nitrogen and hinder growth and development. If nitrogen is excessive in the second half of growth, it strengthens the growth of cotton plants but hinders development and reduces yield. If phosphorus is excessive in the first half of the growth of cotton plants, it will strengthen the accumulation of substances in vegetative organs, leading to premature aging, early growth stop, early boll formation stop, and reduced yield. If phosphorus is excessive in autumn, it can cause cotton plants to redevelop, resulting in increased growth of cotton plants and the formation of more late-maturing cotton bolls or cotton bolls that cannot crack.

    Observing cotton for fertilization must also understand root activity,
          soil fertility basis and weather changes
    In addition to nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition, potassium is the most important for cotton plants. In addition, trace elements such as boron and zinc also have important physiological effects, but these will not be discussed here.

    The mineral nutrition of cotton plants is absorbed from the roots, so observing cotton for fertilization must also understand root activity. After cotton seedlings emerge, the cotton roots grow rapidly downward and can reach 12 to 15 centimeters in length after five to six days. Two weeks after cotton seedlings emerge, the main root can reach a depth of 40 to 50 centimeters. At that time, the length of the main root can be two to three times longer than the above-ground part. By the end of the growing season, the main root can reach a depth of 1 to 2 meters. The root system of cotton plants has dense lateral roots. The most active part of the root system is generally located within the 10 to 30 centimeter soil layer. The characteristics of the root system are closely related to the timing of fertilization, the amount of fertilizer, and the application location.

    The above only discusses some physiological characteristics of cotton plants related to fertilization. Some physiological characteristics can be reflected in the morphology. Observing cotton for fertilization can be done from the morphology. For example, with a lack of nitrogen nutrition, the leaves are light green or yellow-green, the stems are slender, the leaves are small, there are fewer flower organs, and the lower leaves fall off early. When this nitrogen deficiency of cotton plants is discovered and fertilization is used for remedy, it is often too late. Therefore, observing cotton for fertilization is more important to be familiar with the internal changes in the growth and development of cotton plants, understand the requirements of cotton plants for nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition at each developmental stage, and then, according to specific conditions such as climate and soil, find ways to use certain types and amounts of fertilizer and appropriate fertilization time and application location to maximize the requirements of cotton plants.

    After learning when cotton plants need which nutrients and how much nutrients, to decide how to fertilize, it is also necessary to understand the fertility basis of the soil and other related characteristics. For example, the nitrogen and phosphorus absorbed by cotton plants during its lifetime have a certain ratio, but the nitrogen and phosphorus content, existing forms, and change patterns in various soils vary greatly. Therefore, the nitrogen and phosphorus ratio of fertilizer applied in each region changes accordingly. If the nitrogen and phosphorus content and related characteristics in the soil are understood, targeting the certain requirements of cotton plants for nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition, the problem of proper combination of nitrogen fertilizer and phosphorus fertilizer can be considered with more basis. The type, time, and method of fertilization vary depending on the soil fertility basis. The fertility of soil in cotton-growing areas in our country is generally not high enough, and the supply of fertilizer is also insufficient. In this way, cotton plants grow short, the number of fruiting branches and fruit nodes is small, a small number of cotton bolls are borne on the fruit nodes near the main stem, and the shedding of buds and bolls on the upper fruiting branches and marginal fruit nodes is serious. In the case of insufficient base fertilizer and a small amount of topdressing, topdressing should be applied as timely as possible, approximately starting around the beginning of the budding stage, to strive for more fruit nodes and more cotton bolls. Only nitrogen fertilizer can be used for the type of fertilizer, and phosphorus and potassium fertilizer are not so needed. At the same time, in order to make the small amount of fertilizer obtain the most economical use, 3 to 4 jin of ammonium sulfate can be mixed with water and applied in holes, or human manure and urine can also be applied in holes. Cotton farmers in the Yangtze River Basin cotton area have this experience of economical fertilization. There are also large areas of cotton fields with a higher fertility basis in cotton-growing areas in our country, and the fertilizer supply is not lacking, especially in high-yielding areas and high-yielding experimental fields. In this case, attention should be paid to controlling the time and amount of topdressing in the early stage. Generally speaking, before cotton plants flower, nitrogen fertilizer should be controlled, and phosphorus and potassium fertilizer should be applied appropriately and more to prevent cotton plants from growing excessively. After several cotton bolls have been formed in the middle and lower parts of the cotton plant, nitrogen fertilizer should be applied in an appropriate amount. This fertilization situation is roughly in line with the pattern of nutrient absorption by cotton plants during its lifetime as introduced above. Farmers' high-yield experience also strongly illustrates this point. Liuying Production Team of Zhentou People's Commune, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, has improved cotton production year after year since liberation. They have rich experience in cotton planting, and their fertilization experience is even more prominent. Their cotton fields are irrigated and apply more organic fertilizer (6,000 jin of good-quality compost per mu in 1958), laying a good fertilizer base. In this way, no topdressing is applied during the seedling period. The first topdressing starts at the beginning of the budding stage. The principle of topdressing is "phosphorus first, then nitrogen, less first, then more." After the peak flowering period, nitrogen fertilizer is no longer applied. Phosphorus is sprayed outside the roots when necessary. Through such fertilization and combined with other measures, the team enables cotton plants to achieve the high-yield requirements of "early setting of bolls before the monsoon, more setting of bolls during the monsoon, and striving for autumn bolls." In short, the soil conditions are extremely complex, the content of observing the land is very rich, and the experience of farmers in observing the land is extremely valuable.

    The growth and development of cotton plants are closely related to the local seasons and weather changes. The general pattern of nutrient absorption by cotton plants during its lifetime has its special and certain variations in a certain area. As mentioned earlier, cotton plants absorb almost 50% of the nitrogen and 60% of the phosphorus absorbed in their lifetime during the period from the peak flowering period to the first boll cracking. It can be seen that the experience of late-stage topdressing proposed in last year's Great Leap Forward in agricultural production has a physiological basis. However, the last fertilization should indeed not be too late, which depends on the length of the growing season. The deadline for the last fertilization in the Yangtze River Basin and the Yellow River Basin can be later than in the Northeast and Northwest cotton areas. Of course, even in the same area, it must be determined according to the climate changes of the year. Cotton farmers in Zhejiang rarely fertilize when the plum rain season arrives or is about to arrive. This is their good experience in observing the sky. Because there is a lot of rain and poor sunshine during the plum rain season, and cotton fields have a lot of water content, fertilization at this time, especially the application of a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer, is often not conducive to the development of cotton plants during the budding stage, and it is also easy to lead to excessive growth of cotton plants, which seriously affects the normal development of cotton plants in the future. As for the fact that fertilization is easy to lose fertilizer nutrients during the rainy season, that is another matter. The absorption of nutrients by cotton plants is closely related to the weather changes at that time. Temperature changes directly affect the activity of the root system. Within a certain range, an increase in temperature will increase the activity of the root system. At the same time, an increase in temperature will also strengthen the activity of soil microorganisms and promote the effective utilization of soil nitrogen and phosphorus. Here, the sky, the land, and the cotton have intricate and complex constraints. Observing the sky, observing the land, and observing the cotton is to master the relationship between the three, and through reasonable fertilization and other cultivation measures, enable cotton plants to grow and develop well.

    看棉施肥的生理基础
    过兴先
          “看天看地看棉花”
              是棉花施肥的秘诀
    施肥对于棉株生长发育和产量、品质有极大的影响。肥料施到棉田后所起的作用，不仅决定于棉株的本性，而且也决定于棉株的生活条件，特别是土壤气候和农业技术等因素。我国农民有极丰富的施肥经验，植棉能手曲耀离和张秋香，都主张施肥要“看天看地看棉花”，简单的七个字生动地道出了棉花施肥的秘诀。这秘诀包含着复杂而丰富的科学内容和技术措施。真正学会看天看地看棉花，做到得心应手地施肥，并非易事。看天，就得熟悉季节变化和温度、雨量、日照等天气因素；看地，要了解棉田土壤的种类、质地、水热条件和肥力变化；看棉花，要学会和棉花讲话，懂得棉花什么时候吸收什么养分，需要多少养分，以及这些养分对于棉株生长发育的关系。棉花离不开天和地的具体条件，看天不是对天气简单的了解，而是要在了解季节和天气变化的基础上，看得出天气和棉花生长发育的关系和天气对于土壤特性的影响。同样，看地就得和看天看棉花联系起来；看棉花就得和看天看地统一起来。看天看地看棉花的中心是看苗施肥，总结农民看苗施肥的经验，不仅要掌握到方法和技术，更重要的还要领会对看苗施肥的看法和观点。运用先进的科学理论和已有的研究成果是总结经验的重要武器。我们必须使科学理论和农民丰产经验结合起来，才能进一步提高丰产经验并丰富科学理论。
    看棉施肥，虽然离不开当地的天和地的特殊条件，但是作为施肥的生理基础，有它的一般规律。看棉花，先要了解棉株是怎样生长的。棉株生长由小到大、由轻到重，测定棉株生长量的增加可以用干物质的累积表示，在棉株一生中干物质累积有一定的趋势，从棉苗出土到棉株开始现蕾这一阶段棉株累积的干物质量约为整个生长期最后总量的5％，现蕾开始以后棉株才进入比较剧烈地累积干物质的时期，从现蕾到开花盛期约累积干物质总量的24％，从开花盛期到第一铃开裂，约累积65％，从第一铃开裂到生长期终止，约累积6％。当然，棉株各发育阶段干物质积累的情况是因地区、品种和栽培条件而有所不同的，例如生长期长的品种和生长季较长的地区第一铃开裂到生长期终止这一阶段所积累的干物质比重要相应地大一些。
    棉株在不同发育阶段中干物质的积累，只可使我们了解棉株大致的生长情况，并不能代表养分的吸收。一般讲，养分的吸收随棉株年龄而增多，棉株在苗期吸收养分极少，其后逐渐增多，从开花盛期到第一铃开裂期间吸收量最大。棉花施肥以氮肥磷肥最重要，氮磷施肥问题也最复杂。根据苏联棉花研究所在塔什克的实验结果，棉苗2至3片真叶时期吸收的氮素仅为整个生长期吸收总量的0.25％，磷素（P2O5）0.06％，从2至3片真叶到现蕾以前，吸收氮10.20％、磷8.6％，从现蕾到开花盛期，吸收氮29.20％、磷12.90％，从开花盛期到第一铃开裂，吸收氮48.90％、磷59.60％，从第一铃开裂到生长期终止，吸收氮11.40％、磷18.90％。由此可见，棉株对氮、磷的吸收程度各有不同，在棉株开铃以前，氮的吸收相对地高于磷的吸收，在棉株开铃以后，则磷的吸收相对地高于氮。必须指出，这种棉株不同发育阶段吸收氮、磷的情况是随气候、土壤、品种、栽培条件等因素的不同而有一定差异的。
      棉株在不同的发育阶段
            要求不同的氮磷营养
    棉株各个器官的氮磷含量在不同发育阶段有一定的变化规律。棉苗开始从土壤吸收养分以后，棉株中氮磷含量稍有增加，到现蕾前棉株氮磷含量达最高。此后，由于棉株剧烈的生长以及生殖器官吸收营养物质，营养器官中的氮磷成分下降，到生长期终了，棉株一生中所吸收的氮磷总量约有60％以上集中到棉籽内。棉株一生中从土壤中吸收养分的量，随棉株氮磷成分的百分率、籽棉重以及籽棉与营养器官重的比例而定，棉株生产百斤籽棉从土壤中吸收的养分大致氮为二点八至七点一斤、磷（P2O5）为一至二斤，变动的幅度很大，棉花单位面积产量虽与吸收养分的量并不成正比，但这里可以推知，高额丰产的棉田肥料用量也不必过大的。
    棉株在不同的发育阶段要求不同的氮磷营养条件。棉苗出土后数天之内几乎用不到从土壤内吸收养分，棉苗出土后从七至十到十五至二十天时期内，也即棉苗出现第一、二片真叶的时候为营养的临界期，这时棉苗对磷的营养要求特高，这时期磷如不足，即阻滞生长发育、加高果枝着生部位、延迟成熟并减少产量。棉株结铃期需磷达最高量，这时磷如不足，则增加落铃、阻滞生长、导致不饱满棉籽的产生、影响到籽棉及种子品质。同样，及时的氮营养有其重大意义。棉株出土后七至十天须吸收少量而必要的氮素。棉苗二十天起至第一铃开裂期间氮的营养有极重要的作用。氮的吸收同磷一样，最高吸收量也在棉株结铃期。棉株早期阶段如缺乏氮素，花蕾出现的数量就要受到限制，如在以后追施氮肥虽然还可补救，但氮素供应愈迟，结铃盛期来临愈迟，现蕾至开花到开铃所需的时间延长，增加后期收花量，减少籽棉总产量。反之，如果棉株初期氮的营养条件良好，而在开花结铃期氮素不足，则不能保证有足够的食料运向成长中的棉铃，增多脱落并减低铃重。大体说来，合适的氮磷营养是，在棉苗出土后七至十五天或十至二十天保证磷的供应，开始限制氮的供应；到二十天后则要保证氮的供应；现蕾阶段虽然也要保证供应氮，但并不需要大量的氮。开花结铃阶段对氮磷的供应要求得更多。这是考虑肥料种类、用量、配合比例和施用时期的重要依据。
    棉株不同发育阶段必须有足够的氮磷营养，氮磷两者必须有一定的比例，棉株才能进行正常的生长发育。在棉株磷营养不足的情况下，氮素强化棉株的生长而延迟发育，这时棉株氮的成分增加，特别增多矿物质氮的含量，棉株生长高大，加高第一果枝着生的部位，增多叶枝，增多中心部分结实器官的脱落，增大营养器官与生殖器官之间的比例，减低第一次收花量和总产量，纤维品质降低，棉籽发芽率降低，同时也降低其后代的生产力。在棉株氮营养不足的情况下，氮素强化棉株初期或现蕾以前的生长，加速棉株发育并导致器官的衰老，这种营养条件下的棉株含磷量增高，各器官的矿物质磷特别增多，棉株植科不高大，果枝着生部位低，叶枝发育较弱，中心部分的铃脱落少，结铃停止较早，棉株外围部分的蕾铃脱落多，第一次收花量高，后期收花量低，总产量不高，纤维长度减短，而棉籽的播种品质良好。理想的氮磷营养条件是氮磷两者都充足，这时棉株体内并无氮或磷单方面的高量累积，两者有机质态的含量相对地增加，棉株生长发育正常，产量高而品质好。但是，如果氮磷的营养过多，特别是氮或磷单方面的过多，对棉株生长发育极不利。苗期如氮素单方面的过多，当时棉苗还未形成足量的炭水化合物，会导致非蛋白质态氮的大量累积，阻滞生长发育。生长后半期如氮素过多，强化棉株生长但阻滞发育，减低产量。棉株生长前半期如磷素过多，则加强营养器官物质的累积，导致过早的衰老，生长停止早，结铃停止早，减低产量。如秋季磷素过多，则可以使棉株重新发育，其结果增加棉株生长而形成更多的晚熟棉铃或不能开裂的棉铃。
    看棉施肥还必须了解根系的活动、
          土壤的肥力基础和天气变化
    棉株除氮磷营养外，钾是最重要的。此外如硼锌等微量元素在生理上也有其重要作用，这里都不谈了。
    棉株的矿物质营养都是从根部吸收的，因此看棉施肥还必须了解根系的活动。棉苗出土后，棉根即迅速向下生长，五至六天后可达十二至十五厘米长。棉苗出土后两周主根可深达四十至五十厘米。当时主根的长度较地上部可长二至三倍，到生长期末，主根可深达一至二公尺，棉株根系有稠密的侧根，根系最活动的部分一般位于十至三十厘米土层内。根系的特性与施肥时间、肥料用量和施肥部位有密切关系。
    以上所谈的只是棉株本身与施肥有关的一些生理特性。有些生理特性可从形态上反映出来。看棉施肥，可以从形态上看。例如缺少氮营养，叶色淡绿或黄绿，茎纤弱，叶较小，花器官较少，下部叶脱落早。当发现棉株这种缺氮情况时再作施肥补救，往往已失之过晚。因此看棉施肥更重要的是熟悉棉株生长发育的内在变化，了解棉株各个发育阶段对于氮磷营养的要求，然后再根据气候、土壤等具体条件设法采用一定种类的肥料和用量以及合适的施肥时间和施用部位以最大限度地满足棉株的要求。
    了解到棉株什么时候需要那些养分、多少养分后，要决定怎样施肥，还必须了解土壤的肥力基础及其他有关特性。例如棉株一生中吸收的氮磷有一定的比例，但是各种土壤中氮磷的含量存在形态及变化规律等有极大的差异，因此各地区施用肥料的氮磷比例就相应地变化很大。如果了解到土壤中氮磷的含量和有关特性，针对棉株对于氮磷营养一定的要求，就可以较有根据地考虑氮肥磷肥适当配合使用的问题。土壤肥力基础不同，施肥的种类、时间和方法也就有所不同。我国棉区土壤的肥力一般是不够高的，同时肥料的供应也很不足，这样，棉株生长矮小，果枝和果节数少，在接近主茎的果节上着生少数棉铃，上部果枝和边缘果节上蕾铃脱落严重。在这种基肥不足、追肥用量不多的情况下，追肥施用要力求及时，大致可以在现蕾期开始前后施用，以争取较多的果节，多结些棉铃。肥料的种类可仅用氮肥，磷钾肥不是那么需要的了。同时为了使少量的肥料获得最经济的使用，可以用硫酸铵三至四斤，化水穴施，或用人粪尿穴施也可以，长江流域棉区的棉农是有这种经济施肥的经验的。我国棉区也有大片肥力基础较高的棉田，并且肥料供应也不缺乏，特别如丰产片和丰产试验田，在这种情况下，要注意控制前期追肥的时间和用量，一般说，在棉株开花前，要控制氮肥，适当的多施磷钾肥，以防止棉株徒长。等到棉株中下部结好几个棉铃后，再适量增施氮肥，这样的施肥情况大致与以上所介绍的棉株一生中吸收养分的规律相符合的，农民的丰产经验也有力地说明了这一点。河北石家庄振头人民公社留营生产队，解放后棉产年年提高，他们的植棉经验很丰富，施肥的经验更突出。他们的棉田是水浇地，有机肥料施用较多（1958年亩施质量好的圈肥六千斤），打好肥料底，这样在幼苗期间不施追肥，第一次追肥在现蕾期开始，追肥的原则是“先磷后氮，先少后多”，而在盛花期以后，不再施用氮肥，必要时进行根外喷磷，该队通过这样的施肥并结合其他措施，使棉株达到“早座伏前桃，多座伏里桃，争取秋桃”的丰产要求。总之，土壤的条件极复杂，看地的内容很丰富，农民看地的经验是极可宝贵的。
    棉株生长发育和当地的季节及天气变化有密切的关系。棉株一生中吸收养分的一般规律在某一地区有其特殊的一定的变异。如前所述，棉株在盛花期到第一铃开裂的时期内差不多吸收一生中所吸收的氮50％、磷60％。可见去年农业生产大跃进中提出的后期追肥的经验是有生理依据的，不过最后一次施肥的确不宜过迟，这要根据生长季长短而定，长江流域黄河流域最后一次施肥的截止期可以迟于东北和西北的棉区。当然，即使在同一地区，还得看当年的气候变化而定。浙江的棉农在霉雨季节来到或即将来临之时很少施肥，这是他们看天的好经验，因为霉雨季节雨水多，日照差，棉田含水量多，这时如施肥，特别如施用多量氮肥，往往不利于棉株现蕾阶段的发育，并且容易导致棉株徒长，严重影响到棉株往后的正常发育，至于多雨季节施肥容易流失肥料养分，那又是另一回事。棉株吸收养分与当时的天气变化息息相关。温度的变化对根系的活动有直接影响，在一定范围内温度上升则提高根系的活动力，同时温度上升又加强土壤微生物的活动和促进土壤氮磷的有效化。在这里，天、地、棉花三者有着错综复杂的制约关系。看天看地看棉花就是要掌握三者间的关系，通过合理施肥和其他栽培措施，使棉株良好的生长发育。
