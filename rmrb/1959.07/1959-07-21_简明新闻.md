　　Feeding Mulberry Enhances Growth

　　Can the growth of tussah silkworms be enhanced by feeding them? The results of experiments at the Da Gongling Tussah Silkworm Farm in Anhui Province prove that it is possible. Starting from the third molt of the silkworms, they used baking soda and fatty pork slices ground into a fine powder, which was sprayed onto the oak leaves with a powder sprayer for the silkworms to eat. This was done twice a day, morning and afternoon. By doing so, the silkworms developed faster, the molting period was shortened, and there were no diseases. The weight of the silkworms, per ten heads, was about eight grams heavier than ordinary silkworms. The third molt period was shortened by one and a half days, the fourth molt period by more than two days, and the fifth molt period by two and a half to three days.

　　Guizhou Farmers Hunt Harmful Beasts and Birds

　　Farmers of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of Guizhou Province are hunting harmful beasts and birds day and night to protect the early-maturing crops that are about to be harvested.

　　In the past half month, people have been besieging the mountains during the day and defending the fields at night, eliminating a total of more than 2,200 harmful beasts such as wild boars, porcupines, and wild goats.

　　This year, all tea areas paid attention to summer tea production while picking spring tea. All tea gardens universally weeded and fertilized, so the summer tea buds grew lush and strong, and grew well.
