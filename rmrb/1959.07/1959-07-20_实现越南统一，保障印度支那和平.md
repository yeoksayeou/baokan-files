    Achieving Vietnam's Reunification, Safeguarding Peace in Indochina

    Today marks the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords on the Indochina issue. The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council has called on the Asian-African Solidarity Committees of all countries and all peace-loving people in the world to hold "Vietnam Day" today, demanding that the American aggressive forces withdraw from South Vietnam, implement the Geneva Accords, and realize the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. The Chinese people actively respond to this call and express warm support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

    The signing of the Geneva Accords five years ago was of great significance for safeguarding peace in Indochina and the Far East. The basic spirit of the Geneva Accords is to seek a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue on the basis of respecting the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the Indochinese countries. As a result of the signing of this agreement, the flames of war in Indochina were extinguished, and peace was restored. From that time on, the people of Indochina had ample possibilities to build their beautiful motherlands. The Geneva Accords also provided another example for the peaceful resolution of international disputes. Therefore, all peace-loving people in the world and the people of Indochina unanimously supported this agreement and believed that the countries concerned should respect and earnestly implement the Geneva Accords to consolidate peace in Indochina and the Far East. Over the past five years, thanks to the efforts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the people of Indochina, and many countries and people concerned, the Geneva Accords have played a positive role in maintaining peace in the Indochina region.

    Over the past five years, a serious struggle between two paths – maintaining the Geneva Accords and undermining the Geneva Accords – has been waged in Vietnam and throughout Indochina. From the first day the Geneva Accords were signed, the American imperialists and their accomplices launched a frenzied attack on the Geneva Accords. Two months after the signing of the Geneva Accords, American imperialism pieced together the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and openly declared that South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia were included in the "protection" scope of this aggressive bloc. The United States instigated the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to hold unilateral illegal "elections" and "referendums" in South Vietnam, hindering Vietnam from achieving peaceful reunification in accordance with the final declaration of the Geneva Conference. The United States stepped up its arms expansion and war preparations activities in South Vietnam, turning South Vietnam into an advance base for aggression against Indochina and Southeast Asia. The number of American military advisory group personnel in South Vietnam has increased from 200 to more than 2,000, and large quantities of combat weapons have been shipped in, and large-scale aggressive bases for the navy, army, and air force have been built. Recently, responsible American officials have constantly revealed that they are also preparing to equip the South Vietnamese army with atomic weapons and missiles. The United States directed the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to promulgate fascist decrees, establish fascist rule, and carry out brutal suppression and persecution of former resistance personnel and patriotic people in South Vietnam. Over the past five years, more than 180,000 people have been imprisoned, more than 10,000 have been injured or disabled, and nearly 5,000 have been massacred; the Phu Loi massacre was created, and 6,000 political prisoners were poisoned; even under the command of senior American officers, barbaric "military sweeps" were carried out against peaceful residents of South Vietnam, using artillery and aircraft to deal with the patriotic people of South Vietnam. The United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique attempted to use fire and sword to stifle the patriotic will of the South Vietnamese people and their desire for national reunification. Recently, American imperialism has been actively planning a military alliance involving South Vietnam, Laos, and individual member states of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, stepping up the construction of strategic highways connecting South Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand, and establishing new military bases in South Vietnam and Laos to threaten the independence and security of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The United States is using South Vietnam and Thailand to continuously plot conspiracies to subvert Cambodia; directing the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique to infringe upon our country's sovereignty over the Xisha Islands. At the same time, the United States colluded with the Lao government of Phoui Sananikone to abandon the Geneva Accords and brazenly provoked a civil war. All these criminal activities cannot but pose a serious threat to peace in Indochina.

    As a signatory to the Geneva Accords, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently represented the will of more than 20 million Vietnamese people over the past five years and has made significant efforts to fully implement the Geneva Accords and achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. In 1955, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requested consultations in accordance with the Geneva Accords and the realization of Vietnam's reunification through democratic general elections as scheduled in July 1956. After these proposals were unreasonably rejected by the South Vietnamese authorities, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam repeatedly proposed suggestions to bring the people of North and South Vietnam closer and to communicate with each other. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam voluntarily reduced its army, gradually reduced its defense budget, and requested the South Vietnamese authorities to take corresponding measures. However, the South Vietnamese authorities, under the direction of the United States, brazenly rejected all proposals conducive to eliminating the state of isolation between the North and South. The United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique deliberately created a divide between the North and South, attempting to turn the temporary demarcation line, which served as a military demarcation line, into a political or territorial border, leaving Vietnam in a state of permanent division.

    The facts of the past five years have fully proved that the American imperialism's interference and obstruction, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's treasonous activities disregarding national interests, are the biggest obstacles to achieving Vietnam's peaceful reunification and the fundamental reason why peace in Indochina cannot be stabilized. However, since the Vietnamese people and the people of Indochina, with the support of the world's peace forces, were able to force the imperialists to stop the war in Indochina and accept the Geneva Accords five years ago today, then today, five years later, the Vietnamese people and the people of Indochina, in the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, have even more confidence and strength to safeguard the dignity of the Geneva Accords. The American aggressive forces' attempt to prevent the Vietnamese people from achieving the victory of peaceful reunification and to prevent the people of Indochina from moving towards complete independence and freedom is absolutely impossible. Today, all of Vietnam, all of Indochina, and peace-loving people in countries around the world are unanimously demanding: Vietnam must be peacefully reunified, the Geneva Accords must be fully implemented, and the independence, peace, and security of the Indochinese countries must be reliably guaranteed!

### 实现越南统一，保障印度支那和平

    实现越南统一，保障印度支那和平
    今天是有关印度支那问题的日内瓦协议签订五周年纪念日。亚非人民团结理事会书记处号召各国的亚非团结委员会以及世界上一切爱好和平的人民在今天举行“越南日”，要求美国侵略势力撤出南越，贯彻执行日内瓦协议，实现越南的和平统一。中国人民积极响应这个号召，并对越南人民争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争表示热烈的支持。
    五年前日内瓦协议的签订，对于保障印度支那和远东和平具有极为重大的意义。日内瓦协议的基本精神是在尊重印度支那各国人民的主权、独立与领土完整的基础上，求得印度支那问题的和平解决。这个协议签订的结果，印度支那的战火熄灭了，和平恢复了。从那时候起，印度支那各国人民有了建设自己美好祖国的充分的可能性。日内瓦协议也为和平解决国际争端提供了又一个范例。因此，全世界一切爱好和平的人民和印度支那各国人民一致拥护这个协议，并且认为有关各国应该尊重和切实履行日内瓦协议，以巩固印度支那和远东的和平。五年以来，由于越南民主共和国、印度支那各国人民以及许多有关国家和人民的努力，日内瓦协议对维护印度支那地区的和平，起了积极的作用。
    五年以来，在越南和整个印度支那，进行着维护日内瓦协议和破坏日内瓦协议的两条道路的严重的斗争。从日内瓦协议签订的第一天起，美帝国主义者及其走卒们就向日内瓦协议发动猖狂的进攻。在日内瓦协议签订后两个月，美帝国主义便拼凑了东南亚侵略集团，并公然宣布把南越、老挝和柬埔寨列入这个侵略集团的“保护”范围。美国唆使吴庭艳集团在南越举行片面的非法“选举”和“公民投票”，阻挠越南根据日内瓦会议最后宣言，以实现和平统一。美国在南越加紧扩军备战活动，把南越变成侵略印度支那和东南亚的前进基地。美国在南越的军事顾问团人员已从二百名增加到二千多名，并运进大量的作战武器，大规模地修建海陆空军的侵略基地；最近，美国官方的负责人士不断地透露，还准备以原子武器和导弹来装备南越军队。美国指使吴庭艳集团颁布法西斯法令，建立法西斯统治，对南越前抗战人员和爱国人民进行残暴的镇压和迫害，五年来使十八万余人被囚禁，一万余人受伤或残废，近五千人被残杀；制造富利惨案，用毒药谋害六千名政治犯；甚至在美国高级军官指挥之下，对南越的和平居民进行野蛮的“军事扫荡”，用大炮和飞机对付南越的爱国人民。美国和吴庭艳集团企图用火和剑来扼杀南越人民的爱国意志和要求祖国统一的愿望。最近以来，美帝国主义正在积极策划有南越、老挝和东南亚侵略集团个别成员国参加的军事联盟，加紧修建连接南越、老挝和泰国的战略公路，在南越和老挝建立新的军事基地，以威胁柬埔寨王国和越南民主共和国的独立与安全。美国利用南越和泰国不断策划颠覆柬埔寨的阴谋；指使南越吴庭艳集团侵犯我国西沙群岛的主权。同时，美国勾结老挝培·萨纳尼空政府废弃日内瓦协议，悍然挑起内战。所有这些罪恶活动，不能不使印度支那的和平遭受到严重的威胁。
    作为日内瓦协议签字一方的越南民主共和国，五年来一贯地代表了两千多万越南人民的意志，为彻底履行日内瓦协议，实现越南的和平统一而进行了重大的努力。越南民主共和国政府在1955年就要求根据日内瓦协议举行协商，并如期在1956年7月经由民主普选实现越南统一。在这些建议被南越当局无理拒绝以后，越南民主共和国政府又一再提出使越南北方和南方人民互相接近、互相往来的建议。越南民主共和国政府自动裁减军队，逐步减少国防预算，并要求南越当局采取相应的措施。但是，南越当局却在美国的指使下悍然拒绝一切有利于消除南北双方之间隔绝状态的建议。美国和吴庭艳集团蓄意制造北南双方之间的鸿沟，妄图把作为军事分界线的暂时性的界线变成政治的或领土的边界，使越南陷于永久的分裂。
    五年来的事实充分地证明了，美帝国主义的干涉、阻挠和吴庭艳集团不顾民族利益的卖国活动，是实现越南和平统一的最大障碍，是印度支那和平不能稳定的根本原因。但是，既然在五年以前的今天，越南人民和印度支那各国人民，在全世界和平力量的支持下，能够迫使帝国主义者停止印度支那的战火，接受日内瓦协议，那么在五年以后的今天，越南人民和印度支那各国人民，在东风压倒西风的形势下，就更有信心和力量来维护日内瓦协议的尊严。美国侵略势力企图阻挡越南人民取得和平统一的胜利，阻挡印度支那各国人民走向完全独立和自由的道路，这是绝对做不到的。今天，全越南，全印度支那，以及世界各国的爱好和平人民同声要求：越南一定要和平统一，日内瓦协议一定要彻底履行，印度支那各国的独立和平和安全一定要得到可靠的保障！
