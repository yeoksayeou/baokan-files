Underground Vanguard
By our reporter Shao Quan

One day in early July, in a dark coal lane of the second mining area of the Datai Coal Mine, two lights from miners' lamps appeared. Xu Kuiliang, the leader of the 23rd excavation team, and Wang Ruichi, the deputy leader, ran from one end of the coal lane, carrying an electric drill. After turning a corner, the two sat down side by side.

Wang Ruichi wiped the sweat from his forehead and said to Xu Kuiliang, "This time we're drilling deep, this round of blasting will definitely excavate more than the last one." Xu Kuiliang nodded and said, "The depth is enough, but our early shift is the first blasting of the whole team, we have to drill even faster next time, we must overfulfill the task and have a 'red' start."

While the two were talking, the blaster had already pulled out the wire. With a twist of the detonator, there was a "boom," and a wave of air rushed towards them. Then, the exhaust fan roared, and the air duct expanded along the coal lane, driving the fumes and coal dust out of the lane with fresh air.

Amidst the loud noise of the exhaust fan, Wang Ruichi shouted into Xu Kuiliang's ear, "Team leader, while the fumes haven't completely dissipated, before we start supporting the tunnel, why don't we go and open another coal lane? Wouldn't that speed up the excavation?" Xu Kuiliang said upon hearing this, "Good idea!" With that, the two stood up and walked towards the other end of the coal lane. The sound of the electric drill echoed from where they disappeared.

According to the mine's usual practice, their method of operation is called deep-hole, multi-face, multi-cycle operation. It makes full use of working hours and speeds up excavation. Since the whole team held a team leader meeting a few days ago, and Xu Kuiliang challenged the other two teams, the whole team's enthusiasm has been like adding fuel to the fire, getting stronger and stronger. Today, they used this method of operation again, and the whole team of twelve excavated more than ten meters in eight hours, overfulfilling the task by 160%.

For the 23rd team, overfulfilling the task is no longer new. But to overfulfill the daily plan every day since July is really not a simple matter. This month, they are excavating a new working face in the second mining area for the third coal extraction team. This working face is the most difficult one encountered this year. Not only is the coal seam hard and the ventilation poor, but to excavate here, one has to climb a narrow slope more than ninety meters long and forty-five degrees steep, with two vertical shafts straight up and down above. Not to mention transporting pit props, just walking up there empty-handed is difficult enough. On this working face, three hundred and sixty meters must be excavated in the whole month to keep up with the needs of coal extraction.

This arduous excavation task fell on the 23rd team, which has consistently overfulfilled its tasks. This is an honor for the 23rd team, but also a severe test. Chen Fengmin, Xu Kuiliang, and Gao Yongyu, the three team leaders, on behalf of all the miners, solemnly assured the Party branch of the work section: they will definitely complete the excavation task and open the working face for the third extraction team!

Team leader Xu Kuiliang was born with a Xue Gang-like temper, saying and doing at the same time. Since July, this team has made the most progress, and the enviable rotating red flag has been hung on the wall in the dormitory.

The workers in Chen Fengmin's team are also a group of brave and capable men. The team has highly skilled generals like Zhang Yonggui and Wang Wenzhi, the veteran transporter Guan Lianru, and the young and strong Guo Jicai and Mu Shuyuan, who work like two little tigers.

After taking over from Xu Kuiliang's team, they sent Guo Jicai, Mu Shuyuan and five others to transport pit props, and Zhang Yonggui and others to excavate and drill holes from both ends. It's true that a general's performance is worth two ordinary men, as soon as the old worker Zhang Yonggui and his assistant went into action, they drilled holes and blasted, working boldly and efficiently. In one hour, they supported two pairs of props and excavated more than one meter.

By the time they were about to get off work, the whole team of ten had already supported sixteen pairs of props and excavated nine meters, exceeding the daily plan by nearly two times.

In order to save time, the whole team concentrated their efforts, seized the last opportunity, and strived to support one more pair of props. Unexpectedly, before the last pair of props was properly supported, Gao Yongyu's team had already come to take over. Deputy team leader Wang Congxin said strangely:

"Hey, there's still more than ten minutes left, why are you taking over already?"

Gao Yongyu said with a smile: "What's the difference, you go back and rest early!"

"Rest?!" Wang Congxin became anxious, "Our work is not finished yet, and besides, one of the electric drills is broken and hasn't been repaired, and we haven't had time to prepare anything else for you, it's not good to take over so early!"

"Old Wang, you don't need to prepare. This pair of props should be considered your team's completed task, go back quickly, otherwise we'll be idling." Gao Yongyu's miners, without allowing any explanation, pushed Wang Congxin's team away.

When Gao Yongyu's team arrived underground, they were impressed by the rapid excavation of Chen Fengmin's team, and they secretly resolved to work harder and surpass them.

Zhao Shenglong and Li Yuanlong are the "two dragons" in the coal lane, and are famous quick hands in the 23rd team. In terms of drive, they are evenly matched, and in terms of technology, they are not far apart. One is racing against time, using the blasting time to cut the prop joints, and the other is speeding up, rushing into the coal lane before the blasting fumes have completely dissipated. The blaster Xu Zhenming is also quick-witted and quick-handed, after completing the blasting task, he also squeezed out time to help transport materials. In the two coal lanes, the sound of blasting, electric drills, and cutting wood could be heard constantly, and props were supported one after another, and the coal lane was visibly excavated deeper and deeper.

The workers responsible for transporting materials shuttled back and forth in the coal lane like shuttles, and no matter how fast the excavation was, they never failed to supply materials.

People who do not understand Gao Yongyu's team think that they are carrying out a blitz when they see such a working situation. In fact, they are always so busy every time they go to work, but they are also orderly, busy but not chaotic. There are only two workers above level six in this team, but more than half of the team has learned to be multi-skilled. Drilling, supporting, cutting, framing, transporting, repairing...they can do everything, and when one link can't keep up, everyone can help each other. This characteristic of clear division of labor and unity and cooperation is an important reason why Gao Yongyu's team often wins in competitions. On this day, they once again gave full play to this specialty, and thirteen people excavated 13.6 meters, exceeding the daily excavation plan by two and a half times. The excavation speed even exceeded the previous two teams.

On the most difficult working face, the 23rd team insisted on a continuous competition from shift to shift, achieving overproduction by everyone, overproduction by every team, and overproduction every day, and completed the task of excavating 360 meters in July eleven days ahead of schedule, opening up a victorious avenue for coal extraction.

    7月初的一天，大台煤矿第二采区一条漆黑的煤巷里，透出了两点矿工灯的亮光，煤巷掘进二十三组班长徐奎亮和副班长王瑞池两人抱着电钻，从煤巷的一头跑了过来。拐了一道弯儿，两人并排坐下。
    王瑞池一边擦脑门上的汗，一边对徐奎亮说：“这回咱们打眼深，这一茬炮准比上一炮掘进得多。”徐奎亮点点头说：“深度已够了，不过咱们早班是全组的头一炮，下回打眼还得再快一点，一定要超额完成任务，来个开班红。”
    两人正在说话之间，放炮员已经把电线拉了出来，一拧放炮器，只听“轰”的一声，一阵气浪，迎面冲来。接着，抽风机响起了震耳的声音，风带顺着煤巷膨胀起来，新鲜空气把炮烟和煤尘从煤巷里赶出去。
    王瑞池在抽风机哗哗的响声中，对着徐奎亮的耳朵大声喊道：“班长，咱们乘炮烟没散完，不能支柱的功夫，再去开另外一条煤巷，这样交叉作业，不是掘进得更快一点吗？”徐奎亮一听，说：“好主意！”说罢两人站起身来，向煤巷另一端走去。在他们消失的地方，传来了电钻的吼声。
    按照矿上贯常的说法，他们这种作业方法叫作深孔多头多循环。它能够充分利用工时，加快掘进速度。自从前几天全组召开了班长会议，徐奎亮向其他两个班提出挑战之后，全班的劲头就好像火上加油，越来越猛。今天，他们又采用这种作业方法，全班十二人在八小时之内掘进了十米多，超额完成任务160％。
    对于二十三组来说，超额完成任务已经不是新事了。但是7月份以来天天超额完成日计划，可真不是一件简单事。这个月，他们在第二采区一个新工作面为回采三组掘进。这个工作面是今年以来所碰到的最困难的一个工作面，煤层硬、通风不良还不说，要到这里掘进，得爬一个九十多米长、四十五度陡的狭窄斜坡，上面还有两个直上直下的立眼，别说运坑木，空手走一趟也够困难的。就在这个工作面，全月要掘进三百六十米，才能赶得上回采的需要。
    这个艰巨的掘进任务落在了一贯超额完成任务的二十三组身上，这对于二十三组来说，是个光荣，也是个严重的考验。陈凤民、徐奎亮和高永裕三个班长，代表全组矿工向工段党支部斩钉截铁地保证：一定完成掘进任务，为回采三组打开工作面！
    班长徐奎亮生来就有一副薛刚式的脾气，说了就干。7月份以来，这个班进尺最多，宿舍里的墙头上，挂上了令人羡慕的流动红旗。
    陈凤民这个班的工人也都是一些勇猛过人的好汉子，班里有技术高强的大将张永贵、王文智，背料的老将管连儒，还有年青力壮的郭纪才和穆树尧，干起活来就像两只小老虎。
    他们接过徐奎亮班以后，一面派郭纪才、穆树尧等五个人去运坑木，一面派张永贵等人分两头掘进打眼。真是大将出马，一个顶两，老工人张永贵和他的助手一上阵，又是打眼，又是放炮，干起活来大刀阔斧，干脆利落，一个时辰，就支好了两对柱，掘进了一米多。
    快下班的时候，全班十个人已经支了十六对柱，掘进了九米，超过日计划将近两倍。
    为了争取时间，全班集中了力量，抓紧最后时机，争取再支一对柱。没想到最后一对柱还没支好的时候，高永裕班的人已经来接班了。副班长王从信奇怪地说：
    “咦，还差十几分钟，你们怎么就接班来了？”
    高永裕笑着说：“什么差不差的，你们早点回去休息吧！”
    “休息？！”王从信急了，“我们的活还没干完呢，再说，电钻坏了一个还没修好，又没来得及给你们做好其他准备，这么早来接班可不行！”
    “老王，不用你们准备啦。这对支柱应该算你们完成的任务，快回去吧，不然我们就窝工啦。”高永裕班的矿工们不容分说，连说带推，把王从信班撵走了。
    高永裕班的一伙人到了井下，看到陈凤民班掘进飞快，不由得心中佩服，一面暗下决心，加倍努力，超过他们。
    赵生龙和李元龙二人，是煤巷里的
  “两条龙”，在二十三组是有名的快手。论干劲半斤八两，论技术八两半斤，一个是分秒必争，利用放炮时间，就砍好了支柱接口，一个是快马加鞭，炮烟还没完全散尽，又冲进煤巷干了起来。放炮员许振明也眼明手快，完成放炮任务之后，又挤出时间，帮助运料。只听得两条煤巷里不断传出炮声、电钻声和砍木料声，支柱一对接着一对支了起来，煤巷眼瞅着越掘越深。
    负责运料的工人在煤巷上下，穿梭一般你来我往，掘进再快，也从没有供不上料的时候。
    不了解高永裕班的人，看到这样的工作情形，以为他们是在进行突击。其实，他们每次上班都是这样紧张，但是又有条不紊，紧张而不乱。这个班六级以上的工人只有两个，可是全班一大半人都学会了多面手。打眼、支柱、砍柱、架盘、运料、提修……样样能干，在一个环节赶不上的时候，谁都能帮谁一把手。这个又明确分工，又团结协作的特点，是高永裕班在竞赛当中时常取胜的一个重要原因。这一天，他们又充分发挥了这种特长，十三个人掘进了十三点六米，超过了日掘进计划的两倍半。进尺速度更超过了前两个班。
    在最困难的工作面上，二十三组坚持了一班赶一班的持久竞赛，做到人人超产，班班超产，日日超产，并且提前十一天超额完成了7月份掘进三百六十米的任务，给回采拓开了胜利的大道。
