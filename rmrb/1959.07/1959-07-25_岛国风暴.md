　　Island Nation Storm
　　By our reporters Wang Boqing and Yu Zhiheng

　　The door opened, and Violeta Casals, the head of the Cuban women's delegation, appeared before us in grass-green military attire, full of vigor, and completely in the guise of a soldier. From Violeta Casals' soldierly movements and demeanor, we immediately sensed the fighting spirit of the revolutionary Cuban people.

　　The victorious Cuban people have now set off a new revolutionary storm, and land reform is sweeping across this Caribbean island nation. Violeta Casals, who participated in battles at the General Headquarters of the rebel army in those years, followed Premier Castro to the rural areas of Oriente Province to carry out land reform work after the revolution's victory. Therefore, our conversation with our Cuban friends naturally began with the new revolutionary storm.

　　"For us, Cuba's land reform is a real revolution, a revolution that includes the majority of the people. The Cuban people are determined to be masters of their own destiny, and no one can make them take a step back," said Violeta Casals, expressing the Cuban people's firm will to carry out land reform from the start, and then she proceeded to introduce to us the victorious development of this struggle.

　　Since the Cuban government formally promulgated the Land Reform Law on June 4 this year, the whole of Cuba has been boiling. From the capital Havana to the vast rural areas and cities of all provinces, people everywhere have held rallies and demonstrations to support the government's land reform and oppose American interference. Following the distribution of large amounts of land belonging to American monopoly capital and Cuban large estate owners to landless peasants, the Cuban people have been even more invigorated. Now the whole of Cuba is投入 into the heated land reform. The people of all cities are supporting the land reform with great enthusiasm, and a wave of donations is sweeping through every class. Workers, staff, women, students, and business people in Havana have purchased more than a thousand tractors and other agricultural implements with the money they donated, and sent them to their peasant brothers. All the streets and parks in Havana are filled with brand-new, gleaming tractors. Some workers collectively donated a day's wages, while others drove the tractors they donated in parades through the streets. Many farmers brought out their potatoes, bananas, eggs, and other agricultural and sideline products for charity sales as a fund to support land reform. The rebel army, 90% of whose members came from poor peasants, marched in Santa Clara wielding weapons, determined to defend the land they were about to receive to the death.

　　Violeta Casals could not suppress her excitement as she described the heated scene of struggle. She stood up from time to time, and raised her hands in forceful gestures. When she spoke specifically about her recent experience of following Premier Castro to the countryside to carry out land reform, she kept bursting into hearty laughter, full of joy.

　　In February of this year, Premier Castro personally led the first work team, first going to Oriente Province to carry out land reform. This area was the old base area where the rebel army fought guerrilla warfare. When the work team entered the village, the peasants there acted as if they had seen long-lost relatives. Old and young, men and women, all ran over to surround Castro tightly, expressing their joy at the land they were about to receive.

　　Speaking of the land reform currently underway in Cuba, every member of the delegation had many personal experiences, and they eagerly wanted to tell us what they knew.

　　Cecilia, who came from a peasant background, had personally suffered from the persecution of large estate owners. Before the victory of the revolution, she was driven off her own land by the large estate owners. She told us that when she recently heard in Cuba that the peasants in the Guines area held a rally to support land reform, she rushed to participate from a distant city. At this rally, she personally saw the peasants and peasant women wearing new clothes, driving newly purchased tractors, and riding in trucks to attend the meeting with great joy. The peasants held many colorful flags and banners in their hands, which read: "Swear to carry out land reform to the death!" "Long live land reform!" She said excitedly: "Look, how much our Cuban peasants desire land reform and desire to be allocated land!"

　　Before Cecilia finished speaking, another member of the delegation, Ana Caridad, enthusiastically interjected and said: "I come from the first cooperative in Camagüey Province." She told us that the farmers there are now organized to carry out production, and the cooperative has also newly established shops, schools, and kindergartens, which has given the farmers great convenience. When she talked about all this, she revealed an uncontrollable sense of excitement and pride.

　　"The Cuban people are all fighting for land reform, and our friends sympathize with us and support us; however, the gentlemen in the White House are very annoyed, and they openly interfere with us!" Violeta Casals said indignantly: "Why are the gentlemen in the White House so annoyed?" At this time, Violeta Casals took out a book in Spanish about land reform from her box and introduced it to us while looking at it.

　　It turns out that American monopoly capital occupies nearly 75% of Cuba's fertile land. The land occupied by "Cuban-American Sugar Company" alone is larger than the area of ninety-six of the one hundred and twenty-six cities in Cuba. The American livestock monopoly organization "King Ranch" occupies land larger than the area of Oriente Province and Camagüey Province combined. Cuba's sugar production and export volume rank first in the world, and half of the country's arable land is planted with sugarcane, while American monopoly capital controls two-thirds of Cuba's sugarcane plantations, and the profits obtained by American monopoly capital in the sugar industry are as high as 500%.

　　After listening to these words from Violeta Casals, it is not difficult to understand why the bosses on Wall Street were furious during the land reform that swept across Cuba.

　　"Whether it is the interference of the American government or the opposition of the big estate owners, we are not afraid," Violeta Casals said with a firm and confident tone, deeply infecting us.

　　Violeta Casals then told us another sensational event in Cuba. When the land reform was about to begin, the Cuban large estate owners with ulterior motives once attempted to bribe the government with five million pesos and ten thousand calves,妄想trying to achieve the goal of canceling the land reform. However, the attempts of these large estate owners burst like soap bubbles, and the government told the people of the whole country about their ugly deeds.

　　The Cuban people, who have been baptized by battle, have taken action, and they are determined to defend the land reform and defend the fruits of the revolutionary victory. Delegation member Maria Teresa introduced that the American interference in the Cuban land reform made the Cuban peasants extremely angry. Later, when the peasants picked up the weapons airdropped by the United States to the counter-revolutionaries, they were even more furious, cursing the United States when they mentioned it, and swearing to each other when they mentioned land reform, expressing their determination. Some said: "Either die or land reform." Some said: "The land of Cuba belongs to the Cuban people, and no one can take it away."

　　Our conversation continued. The enthusiastic Violeta Casals gave us two of her photos, which were taken in January of this year when she followed the rebel army to march into Havana. In the photo, Violeta Casals is holding a machine gun, with a badge with the words "July 26" on her left arm. When we asked about the origin of the pattern on the badge, she pointed to a flag on the table that also had the words "July 26" on it, composed of red and black colors, and said: "This is the flag of 'July 26'. The red color on the flag symbolizes the blood of the sons, and the black color symbolizes the mourning dress of the mothers. This flag inspires the Cuban people to bravely fight for the freedom and complete independence of the motherland."

　　"July 26" is a day of profound revolutionary significance for the Cuban people. On July 26, 1953, the Cuban insurgents launched the first armed struggle against the Batista dictatorship. Although this struggle failed, the spark of the Cuban revolution burned fiercely from then on.

　　Violeta Casals told us that when they left Cuba, the Cuban people were preparing for a million-person demonstration on July 26, just like a festival, to show the firm will and united strength of all the people to defend sovereignty and defend land reform, and to show the Cuban people's determination to oppose American interference. At this time, Violeta Casals stood up again excitedly and solemnly sang the song "July 26":

　　"July 26, this is not just a date,
　　July 26, this is the revolution. . . .
　　Your flag,
　　Spread all over the green grasslands and valleys,
　　Fluttering in the palm groves,
　　Because of your sacrifice,
　　The motherland stood up,
　　Proudly shouted:
　　Long live July 26!"

　　This song sings the new life of Cuba, Cuba has stood up from the "backyard" of the United States. Let American imperialism tremble before the storm of land reform in this island nation! (Attached picture) Violeta Casals, head of the Cuban Women's Delegation

    岛国风暴
    本报记者　汪波清　余志恒
    门开了，古巴妇女代表团团长比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯身穿草绿色军装，精神焕发，完全以一种战士的姿态出现在我们面前。从比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯那战士的动作和举止中，我们立刻感到了革命的古巴人民的战斗气息。
    胜利了的古巴人民现在又掀起了一场新的革命风暴，土地改革正在席卷这个加勒比海的岛国。当年在起义军总司令部参加战斗的比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯，在革命胜利以后，就曾经跟随着卡斯特罗总理到奥连特省的农村中去进行土地改革工作。因此，我们同古巴朋友的谈话很自然地就从新的革命风暴开始了。
    “对于我们说来，古巴的土地改革就是一次真正的革命，一次包括大多数人民的革命。古巴人民决心要做自己命运的主人，任何人都不能使他们后退一步。”比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯团长一开始就这样表达了古巴人民进行土改的坚定意志，并且紧接着向我们介绍了这一斗争胜利发展的情况。
    自从古巴政府今年6月4日正式颁布了土地改革法，整个古巴沸腾起来了。从首都哈瓦那到全国各个省的广大农村和城市，人们到处举行集会、游行示威，支持政府进行土地改革，反对美国干涉。继美国垄断资本和古巴大庄园主的大量土地被分配给无地的农民以后，古巴人民更是精神振奋。现在整个古巴都投入到火热的土地改革中了。各个城市的人民以巨大的热情来支援土地改革，捐献运动的热潮遍及每一个阶层。哈瓦那的工人、职员、妇女、学生和工商界人士已把捐献的钱购买了一千多架拖拉机和其他农具，送给农民兄弟。在哈瓦那的所有大街上和公园里，到处都摆满了崭新发亮的拖拉机。有的工人集体捐出了一天的工资，有的工人驾着他们捐献出的拖拉机在街上列队游行。许多农民把自己的马铃薯、香蕉、鸡蛋和其他农副产品拿出来义卖，作为支援土地改革的基金。90％的成员来自贫苦农民的起义军，手执武器在圣克拉拉游行示威，决心誓死保卫即将分得的土地。
    比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯团长在描绘那火热的斗争情景时，怎么也抑止不住兴奋的心情。她时儿站起来，时儿举起两手作着有力的手势。当她向我们具体地谈到她不久前跟随卡斯特罗总理去农村进行土地改革的情形时，她更是不断发出爽朗的笑声，充满了欢悦。
    今年2月间，卡斯特罗总理亲自带领第一个工作队，首先到奥连特省去进行土地改革。这个地区是当年起义军打游击的老根据地，工作队进村子时，那里的农民就像见了久别重逢的亲人一样，无论老人、小孩、男人、女人，都飞奔地跑来紧紧围住卡斯特罗，表示他们对即将分到土地的喜悦心情。
    谈到古巴目前正在进行的土地改革，代表团的每一个成员都有着许多亲身经历，她们争先地想立即把自己所知道的情况告诉我们。
    农民出身的塞西利亚亲身遭受过大庄园主的迫害，革命胜利以前她就被大庄园主从她自己的土地上赶出来。她告诉我们，当她不久前在古巴听说几尼斯地方的农民举行拥护土地改革的集会时，她从很远的城市中赶去参加。在这个集会上，她亲眼看到农民们、农妇们穿着新衣服，兴高采烈地驾着新买的拖拉机，坐着卡车来开会。农民们手里拿着许多采色的旗帜和标语，上面写着：“誓死进行土改！”“土地改革万岁！”她激动地说道：“看吧，我们古巴的农民们是何等地渴望土地改革，渴望分到土地啊！”
    塞西利亚的话还没有说完，代表团的另一位团员安娜·卡里达德热情地插进来说：“我是从卡马圭省第一个合作社来的”。她告诉我们，她们那里的农民现在已组织起来进行生产，而且合作社里还新设了商店、学校和幼儿园，给了农民很大的方便。她在谈到这一切的时候，流露了无法抑制的兴奋和自豪心情。
    “古巴人民都在为土改而战斗，我们的朋友同情我们，支持我们；然而，美国白宫的先生们却十分恼火，他们公然来干涉我们”！比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯愤慨地说：“白宫的先生们为什么那样恼火呢”？这时候，比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯从箱子里拿出一本西班牙文的有关土地改革方面的书，一边看着一边向我们介绍。
    原来，美国垄断资本霸占着古巴将近75％的肥沃土地。仅“古—美制糖公司”所占有的土地就比古巴一百二十六个市中的九十六个市的面积还要大。美国畜牧业垄断组织“金氏牧场”占有比奥连特省和卡马圭省两个省面积还大的土地。古巴糖产量和输出量都占世界第一位，全国有二分之一的耕地种植甘蔗，而美国垄断资本却控制了古巴三分之二的甘蔗园，在制糖业中，美国垄断资本获得的利润高达500％。
    听了比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯团长的这些话，就不难理解在席卷全古巴的土地改革中，华尔街的老板们为什么要大发雷霆了。
    “不管是美国政府的干涉，也不管是大庄园主的反对，我们决不害怕。”比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯团长那坚定自信的语调，深深感染了我们。
    比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯接着告诉了我们另一件轰动整个古巴的事情。那是在土地改革快要开始的时候，心怀鬼胎的古巴大庄园主曾经企图以五百万比索和一万头牛犊贿赂政府，妄想达到取消土改的目的。但是这些大庄园主的企图像肥皂泡一样破灭了，政府把他们的丑恶行径全盘告诉了全国人民。
    经过战斗洗礼的古巴人民行动起来了，他们决心保卫土地改革，保卫革命胜利的果实。代表团团员玛丽亚·特雷萨介绍说，美国干涉古巴土改，古巴农民无比愤怒。以后农民拾到了美国空投给反革命分子的武器，他们更是怒发冲冠，提起美国就骂，提起土改就互相发誓，表示决心。有的说：“要末就死，要末就是土改。”有的说：“古巴的土地是古巴人民的，谁也不能夺去。”
    我们的谈话在继续着。热情的比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯团长把她自己的两张照片送给了我们，这是今年1月她随起义军向哈瓦那进军时照的。照片上的比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯，手握一支自动枪，左臂戴着缀有“7月26”字样的徽章。我们问起徽章上的图案的由来，她指着桌上放的同样缀有“7月26”字样的一面由红黑两种颜色组成的旗帜说：“这是‘7月26’的旗帜，旗上的红色象征儿子的鲜血，黑色象征母亲的丧服。这旗帜激励古巴人民勇敢地为祖国的自由和完全独立而战斗。”
      “7月26”对于古巴人民来说，这是具有深刻革命意义的日子。古巴起义者在1953年7月26日，第一次举行了反对巴蒂斯塔独裁统治的武装斗争。这次斗争虽然失败了，但是古巴革命的火种从此炽烈地燃烧起来。
    比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯告诉我们，在她们离开古巴的时候，古巴人民就像过节一样筹备7月26日百万人大示威，来显示全体人民保卫主权、保卫土改的坚强意志和团结的力量，显示古巴人民反对美国干涉的决心。这时，比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯团长再一次激动地站立起来，庄严地唱起“7月26日”这支歌：
    “7月26日，这不仅是一个日期，
    7月26日，这就是革命。……
    你的旗帜，
    插遍绿色的草原和山谷，
    飘扬在棕榈树丛中，
    由于你的牺牲，
    祖国站起来了，
    骑傲地喊道：
    7月26日万岁！”
    这歌曲唱出了古巴的新生，古巴从美国“后院”站起来了。让美帝国主义在这个岛国土地改革的风暴前发抖吧！古（附图片）
