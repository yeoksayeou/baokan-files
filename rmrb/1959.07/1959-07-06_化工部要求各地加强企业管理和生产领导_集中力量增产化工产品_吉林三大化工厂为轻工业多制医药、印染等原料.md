Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: The Ministry of Chemical Industry convened a telephone conference on July 3rd with the directors of chemical industry departments/bureaus in various provinces and the heads of directly affiliated enterprises to arrange chemical production work for the third quarter. The general requirement for chemical production in the third quarter, as put forward at the meeting, is: to exert full effort, strengthen management, seize the opportunity, work hard for three months, further promote the quality, high yield, and conservation movement, and greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day with new production achievements.

In the first half of this year, chemical enterprises across the country overcame various difficulties by all means and achieved great results in production. According to statistics from enterprises directly under the Ministry of Chemical Industry and key local chemical enterprises, from January to June, the output of soda ash increased by 23.8% compared with the same period last year, caustic soda increased by 21%, synthetic ammonia increased by 17%, and 666 increased by 16.7%. Methanol increased the most, about five times that of the same period last year.

However, the above-mentioned growth figures are still considerably short of needs. Therefore, the production tasks in the second half of the year will be even more arduous. The meeting emphasized that the third quarter is the decisive quarter for completing the annual production increase task. All chemical enterprises and chemical leading agencies at all levels must seize the work of this quarter, comprehensively arrange production tasks according to specific circumstances, and take practical and feasible specific measures to ensure their completion.

In response to the current problems in chemical production, the meeting proposed that the main tasks for the third quarter are: strictly implementing the quality inspection system for raw materials and products and operating procedures, and further improving product quality; strengthening economic accounting and cost management, and striving to reduce the consumption of raw materials; strengthening the maintenance and repair of equipment to ensure safe production.

In order to do a good job in production in the third quarter, the meeting required all enterprises and chemical leading agencies at all levels to concentrate all or most of their efforts to strengthen enterprise management and production leadership. Design and research institutes in various regions and enterprises should also provide the necessary technical force to guide and cooperate with production. Managers and directors of each factory should concentrate all their efforts to lead production. Some corresponding systems in enterprise management, such as various responsibility systems, technical management systems, safety management systems, and economic accounting systems, should be quickly established and improved in a short period. To this end, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has recently dispatched two working groups to key chemical factories in Shijiazhuang and Shenyang to help with work, in order to learn from experience in strengthening technical management and improving product quality.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 5th: Jilin Chemical Industry Company's Fertilizer, Dye, and Calcium Carbide three major chemical plants, while actively increasing the production of chemical fertilizers, calcium carbide, and other products, are doing everything possible to increase the production of raw materials needed by light industry. At present, the three factories produce more than 20 kinds of chemical raw materials for light industry. Among them are medicinal raw materials salicylic acid, p-ammonium phenyl ether, naphthol AS for printed cloth, indanthrene blue and anan blue for dyeing cloth, red phosphorus for matches, light calcium carbonate for toothpaste, zinc powder for coatings, and terephthalic acid for rayon, etc.

The Jilin Chemical Industry Company recently convened a five-level cadre meeting to determine the mobilization of the masses of employees to strengthen equipment maintenance and to better improve enterprise management to ensure the realization of stable high yield, high quality, and reduced consumption.

    新华社5日讯　化学工业部在本月3日召开了各省化工厅局长及直属企业负责人电话会议，布置第三季度化工生产工作。会上提出的第三季度化工生产的总要求是：鼓足干劲，加强管理，抓紧时机，大干三个月，进一步深入开展优质、高产、节约运动，用新的生产成就来迎接国庆十周年。
    今年上半年，全国化工企业千方百计克服各种困难，生产上获得很大成绩。根据化工部直属企业和地方重点化工企业统计，1至6月份纯碱产量比去年同期增长23.8％，烧碱增长21％，合成氨增长17％，六六六增加16.7％；甲醇增加最多，约为去年同期的五倍。
    但是，上面的增长的数字同需要比较，还有相当距离。因此，下半年的生产任务将更加繁重。会议强调指出，第三季度是完成全年增产任务的决定性的季度，各化工企业及各级化工领导机构必须抓紧这一季度的工作，根据具体情况全面安排生产任务，并且要采取切实可行的具体措施加以保证。
    会议针对当前化工生产存在的问题，提出第三季度的主要工作是：严格执行原料和产品的质量检查制度及操作规程，进一步提高产品质量；加强经济核算和成本管理工作，努力降低原材料的消耗；加强设备的维护检修工作，保证安全生产。
    为了抓好第三季度的生产，会议要求各企业和各级化工领导机构应当集中全部或大部力量，加强企业管理和生产领导。各地各企业的设计研究分院，也应拿出必要的技术力量来指导和配合生产。各厂的经理、厂长都要集中全力领导生产。企业管理上的一些相应的制度，如各种责任制度、技术管理制度、安全管理制度、经济核算制度等，都应当在短时期内迅速健全起来。为此，化学工业部已经在最近派出两个工作组，分赴石家庄和沈阳两地的重点化工厂帮助工作，以便吸取加强技术管理、提高产品质量等方面的经验。
    新华社长春5日电　吉林化学工业公司肥料、染料、电石三大化工厂，在积极增产化学肥料、电石等产品的同时，多方设法增产轻工业需要的原料。目前三个厂所生产的轻工业用化学原料有二十多种。其中有医药原料水杨酸、对铵基苯乙醚，有印花布用的萘酚AS，有染布用的阴丹士林蓝和安安蓝，有火柴原料赤磷，有做牙膏用的轻质碳酸钙，有作塗料用的锌粉，还有人造纤维原料苯二甲酸?等。
    吉林化学工业公司最近召开了五级干部会议，确定发动职工群众加强设备维护工作，并且要更好地改善企业管理，以保证实现稳定高产、优质和降低消耗的要求。（附图片）
