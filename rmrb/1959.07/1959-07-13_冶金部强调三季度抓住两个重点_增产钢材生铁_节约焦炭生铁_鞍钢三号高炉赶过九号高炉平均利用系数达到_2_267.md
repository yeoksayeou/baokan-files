Xinhua News Agency, July 12th. The third quarter is a crucial quarter for this year, and steelworkers across the country must redouble their efforts, launch a campaign to increase production and conserve resources, improve steel quality, strengthen enterprise management, and ensure the completion of the third-quarter steel production tasks. This is the call made by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to steel enterprises nationwide when deploying work for the third quarter.

In the first half of this year, the national output of iron, steel, and steel products all increased compared to the same period last year, and quality improved month by month. Large and medium-sized blast furnaces across the country have learned from the ironmaking experience of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, and the utilization rate of blast furnaces has increased significantly. Small blast furnaces have also made great progress after rational site selection and technical transformation. A number of newly built coke ovens, blast furnaces, converters, and rolling mills have been put into production one after another, and new workers are gradually growing up in production practice. All of these are favorable conditions for the continued leap forward of the steel industry in the second half of this year.

The focus of increased production in the steel industry in the third quarter is steel and pig iron. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has already formulated measures to increase the production of steel and pig iron. The measures to increase steel production are: to give full play to the production capacity of existing rolling mills by increasing the hourly output and operating time of rolling mills; to organize small rolling mills to re-process large steel products to increase the variety of small steel products to meet the needs of users; to accelerate the installation of motors replaced and adjusted to expand the production capacity of existing rolling mills; new rolling mills originally scheduled to be completed in the second half of this year should be put into production on time and strive to be put into production ahead of schedule; do a good job in the processing and supply of the main spare parts of rolling mills—rolling rolls and ingot molds; uniformly allocate steel ingots and billets nationwide, etc.

The focus of conservation for steel enterprises in various regions is on saving coking coal and pig iron. There is great potential for steel enterprises to save in this regard. Taking the consumption of pig iron as an example, according to surveys, the national average converter consumes 1,400 to 1,500 kilograms of pig iron for every ton of steel produced in April and May this year, and individual units even consume 2,000 kilograms, while the advanced unit for saving pig iron—Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant—only needs more than 1,250 kilograms of pig iron to produce one ton of steel. At present, many converter steelmaking workshops are learning from the experience of Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant. If all the converters in the country can catch up with the level of Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, they can save hundreds of thousands of tons of pig iron in the second half of this year alone. In terms of saving coking coal, the measures proposed by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry are: all high-ash raw coal should be washed and selected before entering the furnace for coking; simple coke ovens should be promoted; the iron content of ore should be increased, and quicklime should be used instead of limestone; anthracite should be used instead of coke; coal management should be strengthened to reduce losses and prevent coal from deteriorating, etc. At present, the average coke consumption per ton of iron produced by small blast furnaces in Jiangsu Province is 1,300 to 1,400 kilograms, which is 100 to several hundred kilograms less than in other provinces. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has decided to promote the experience of Jiangsu Province throughout the country.

In terms of improving quality, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is comprehensively promoting the twelve experiences related to improving the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces and Qingdao City's experience of using alkaline hot-blast iron melting furnaces to desulfurize to ensure high-quality and high-yield converter steel.

At present, many steel enterprises are mobilizing the masses of employees to strengthen and improve enterprise management, revise and improve various rules and regulations and responsibility systems, and further promote the development of the movement to increase production and conserve resources.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 12th. In early July, the competition between No. 9 and No. 3 blast furnaces in the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant took on a new development. No. 3 blast furnace defeated its strong opponent, No. 9 blast furnace, and won first place in the entire plant. In these ten days, No. 3 blast furnace overfulfilled the plan every day, producing a total of more than 840 tons of high-quality pig iron, with an average utilization rate of 2.267, and all the iron produced was qualified. The average utilization coefficient of No. 9 blast furnace reached 2.106.

After the No. 9 and No. 3 blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel signed a competition contract with the Dongfeng blast furnace of Benxi in April this year, the employees of these two blast furnaces in Anshan have been adopting the methods of mutual promotion and mutual assistance, and the competition has been very fierce. In May, the utilization coefficients of these two blast furnaces jumped to the top and runner-up positions among the large blast furnaces in the country.

Entering June, No. 9 blast furnace still took the lead and maintained the championship title, while the utilization coefficient of No. 3 blast furnace dropped to 2.008, behind its two comrades. The employees of No. 3 blast furnace immediately concentrated their efforts to find out the shortcomings such as low wind temperature, shallow taphole, poor quality, and uneven material distribution, solve equipment problems, and improve operations. Many furnace workers and gas workers proposed to launch a competition with workers of the same type in No. 9 blast furnace to learn from their advanced experience. In these days, the furnace workers went to work early every day to deal with the taphole. The old workers Li Jianlin and Yan Mingchen also assisted the next shift in baking the taphole after get off work, so that the taphole depth was maintained at more than one meter, and the phenomenon of long-term abnormal taphole was eliminated. The gas workers improved the hot blast operation system, increasing the wind temperature from 950 degrees to 1,000 degrees. The foremen also further implemented the operational policy of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio, and took measures to ensure the smooth operation of the blast furnace; at the same time, they unified the number of batches of charging per shift, so that the blast furnace eliminated the phenomenon of "uneven hunger and satiety, and indigestion." Due to a series of measures, No. 3 blast furnace achieved excellent results in early July.

Now, the employees of No. 3 and No. 9 blast furnaces are further trying to find ways to tap potential, and learn from each other, and are determined to create greater achievements in the third quarter to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day. (Attached photo)

    冶金部强调三季度抓住两个重点
    增产钢材生铁　节约焦炭生铁
    鞍钢三号高炉赶过九号高炉平均利用系数达到2.267
    新华社12日讯　第三季度是今年具有决定性意义的季度，全国钢铁工人必须鼓足干劲，开展增产节约运动；提高钢铁质量；加强企业管理；保证完成第三季度钢铁生产任务。这是冶金工业部最近在部署第三季度工作时向全国钢铁企业发出的号召。
    今年上半年，全国铁、钢、钢材的产量，都比去年同期增加了，质量逐月提高。全国大型和中型高炉，学习了本溪钢铁公司的炼铁经验，高炉利用系数提高得很显著；小型高炉经过合理定点和技术改造，也有很大进步。一批新建的焦炉、高炉、转炉、轧钢机已经陆续投入生产；新的工人也在生产实践中逐渐成长起来。所有这些，都是钢铁工业在今年下半年继续跃进的有利条件。
    钢铁工业第三季度增产的重点是钢材和生铁，冶金工业部已经订出了增产钢材、生铁的措施。增产钢材的措施是：通过提高轧钢机的小时产量、作业时间等办法，充分发挥现有轧钢机的生产能力；组织小型轧钢机对大型钢材进行第二次加工，以增加小型钢材的品种，满足使用单位的需要；加速安装为扩大现有轧钢机生产能力而更换、调整的马达；原订在今年下半年建成的新轧钢机，按时和力争提前投入生产；作好轧钢机的主要备件——轧辊和钢锭模的加工、供应工作；在全国范围内统一调拨钢锭、钢坯，等等。
    各地钢铁企业节约的重点是节约焦煤和生铁。钢铁企业在这方面节约的潜力是很大的。以生铁的消耗为例，据调查，今年4、5月全国转炉平均每炼一吨钢要消耗生铁一千四百到一千五百公斤，个别单位甚至消耗二千公斤，而节约生铁的先进单位——上海第六钢厂，炼一吨钢只需要一千二百五十多公斤生铁。目前，许多转炉炼钢车间都在学习上钢六厂的经验，如果全国的转炉都能赶上上钢六厂的水平，仅今年下半年就可以节约几十万吨生铁。在节约焦煤方面，冶金工业部提出的措施是：高灰分原煤入炉炼焦前全部经过洗选；推行简易焦炉；提高矿石含铁量，用生石灰代替石灰石；用无烟煤代替焦炭；加强煤炭管理以减少损耗、防止煤炭变质等。目前江苏省全省的小高炉平均每炼一吨铁消耗的焦炭为一千三百到一千四百公斤，比其他省少一百到几百公斤。冶金工业部已经决定在全国推广江苏省的经验。
    在提高质量方面，冶金工业部正在全面推广有关提高小高炉生铁质量的十二项经验和青岛市采用碱性热风化铁炉脱硫保证转炉钢优质高产的经验。
    目前，许多钢铁企业都在发动职工群众加强、改善企业管理，修订和健全各种规章和责任制度，进一步推动增产节约运动向前发展。
    新华社鞍山12日电　7月上旬，鞍钢炼铁厂九号和三号高炉之间的竞赛又有了新的发展。三高炉战胜了它的强有力的对手九高炉，获得了全厂第一。这十天内，三高炉每天都超额完成计划，总共多产了八百四十多吨优质生铁，平均利用系数达到二点二六七，所产生铁全部合格。九高炉平均利用系数达到二点一零六。
    鞍钢九号和三号高炉在今年4月份，和本溪东风号高炉签订了竞赛合同以后，鞍钢这两座高炉职工一直采取互相促进、互相帮助办法，竞赛开展的很激烈。5月份，这两座高炉的利用系数分别跃居全国大型高炉的冠军和亚军。
    进入6月份，九高炉仍旧一马当先，保持了冠军称号，而三高炉的利用系数却下降到二点○○八，落在它的两个战友后面。三高炉职工随即集中力量找出了风温低、铁口浅、质量差、跑料不匀等缺点，解决设备上的问题，改进操作。很多炉前工、瓦斯工等工人，提出要与九高炉同工种的工人展开竞赛，学习他们的先进经验。这些日子里，炉前工人每天都提前上班处理铁口，老工人李俭林、阎明臣下班后还协助下一班烤铁口，这样，使铁口深度保持在一米几以上，消灭了铁口长期失常的现象。瓦斯工人改进热风操作制度，使风温由九百五十度提高到一千度。工长们也进一步切实贯彻了提高冶炼强度和降低焦比双管齐下的操作方针，并且采取措施，保证高炉顺行；同时统一了每班的下料批数，使高炉消灭了“饥饱不匀，消化不良”的现象。由于采取了一系列措施，三高炉在7月上旬获得了出色的成绩。
    现在，三高炉和九高炉的职工都在进一步想办法，挖潜力，并且互相学习，决心在第三季度中创造更大的成绩，迎接国庆十周年。（附图片）
