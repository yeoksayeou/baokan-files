Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 21st: TASS reported from Moscow on the 21st that the Soviet government has decided that it is necessary to postpone the scheduled visit of the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, to Denmark, Sweden, and Norway until a more appropriate time in the future.

The Soviet government presented this decision in memoranda delivered to the embassies of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway in Moscow.

The memoranda listed facts about the intensified anti-Soviet activities taken by some organizations and newspapers in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway due to Khrushchev's upcoming visit. The memoranda pointed out that these facts prove that someone in these countries is deliberately creating an environment unfavorable to this state visit. The Soviet government concluded that under these circumstances, it might not be timely for the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers to visit these countries. This visit can be postponed without affecting the relations between the Soviet Union and the Scandinavian countries, and may even be beneficial to the situation.

The Soviet government also delivered a memorandum to the Finnish Embassy in Moscow. The memorandum pointed out that, due to the current circumstances that led to the postponement of Khrushchev's visit to the Scandinavian countries, the Soviet government is now unable to take advantage of the Finnish government's invitation for Khrushchev to visit Finland.

    丹瑞挪国内有人加紧敌视苏联活动
    赫鲁晓夫决定延期访问北欧
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：苏联政府决定，有必要把苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫原定对丹麦、瑞典和挪威的访问推迟到将来更为恰当的时候。
    苏联政府在交给丹麦、瑞典和挪威驻莫斯科大使馆的备忘录中提出了这项决定。
    备忘录列举了丹麦、瑞典和挪威的一些组织和报纸由于赫鲁晓夫将要访问而加紧对苏联采取敌对活动的事实。备忘录指出，这些事实证明，在这些国家里，有人在故意制造一种不利于这次国事访问的环境。苏联政府得出结论，认为在这种情况下，苏联部长会议主席到这些国家去访问未必是适时的。这次访问可以推迟而不致影响到苏联同斯堪的纳维亚国家之间的关系，甚至还可能对事情有利。
    苏联政府希望，在将来，也许在一年以后，当斯堪的纳维亚国家出现了有益于这种访问的良好条件以后，那时就可以重新研究这个问题。苏联政府还交给芬兰驻莫斯科大使馆一份备忘录。备忘录指出，由于目前的环境使得赫鲁晓夫到斯堪的纳维亚国家的访问延期，苏联政府现在也不能利用芬兰政府邀请赫鲁晓夫访问芬兰的机会。
