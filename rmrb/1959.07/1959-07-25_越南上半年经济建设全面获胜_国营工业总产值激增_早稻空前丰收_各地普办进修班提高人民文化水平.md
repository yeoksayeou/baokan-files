    Report from the "People's Daily" in Vietnam: In the first half of this year, North Vietnam achieved great success in realizing the national plan.
    On the agricultural production front, due to the development and consolidation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the deepening of the technological improvement movement, the early rice crop achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average yield of 2,100 kilograms of rice per hectare and a total output of 1.7 million tons. Compared with 1956, the year with the best early rice harvest, this year's early rice harvest exceeded 1956 by 200,000 tons; compared with the same season last year, it exceeded 500,000 tons.
    In the industrial sector, the total output value of state-owned industry in the first half of this year increased by 62.3% compared with the same period last year, and by 3.7% compared with the second half of last year. Among them, the production of means of production increased by 77% compared with the same period last year, and the production of consumer goods increased by 54%. In terms of local industry, many localities rely on handicraft production cooperatives and existing production units to develop local industry. In the first half of this year, more than 80 units have been established in various provinces and counties, most of which are workshops producing agricultural tools, fertilizers, and building materials. Handicraft and private industries have also developed considerably. The fastest growing sectors are those serving basic construction (bricks, tiles, ironware, iron pipes, etc.) and industries producing daily necessities (weaving, sewing, hosiery, bicycle parts, etc.). The quality of products from joint state-private enterprises has improved compared to before.
    In the basic construction sector, the amount of construction completed by units under the Ministry of Construction in the first half of this year was equal to 118% of the total for the whole of last year, and 350% of the same period last year.
    The development of commercial work is also very rapid. In the first half of this year, the people's purchasing power has greatly increased. Compared with the first half of last year, the sales volume of state-owned trade departments increased by 62% for meat, 12% for rice, 368% for fresh fish, 53% for cloth and silk, and 76% for soap. State-owned trading departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have expanded their retail networks in various cities and industrial areas, and have begun to organize purchases and sales locally in rural areas, meeting the needs of the people in a timely manner.
    In the first half of this year, socialist transformation of the individual economy of peasants and handicraftsmen, and the socialist transformation of capitalist economic components, have made great progress. At the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Party, the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement showed a rapid development trend. At the end of 1958, only 65.6% of farmers in the north participated in mutual aid teams and 4.4% of farmers joined agricultural production cooperatives. Now, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid teams and cooperatives has accounted for 90% of the total number of peasant households in the north. The number of cooperatives has increased from 4,722 at the end of last year to 15,000, including 535 advanced cooperatives. This year, the early rice in the cooperatives generally grew well, and the yield per unit area was generally higher than that of individual farmers.
    In the past six months, more attention has also been paid to mobilizing handicraftsmen to participate in production cooperatives and production groups. As of May this year, there were 466 handicraft production cooperatives and 17,000 production groups. 8% of small merchants and peddlers have also been organized, of which about one-third have participated in unified management cooperative groups, and some have participated in supply and marketing cooperatives that also engage in production. In the past period, pilot work on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has been newly developed in Hanoi, Haiphong, Bac Ninh, Phu Tho and Hong Quang areas.
    Hanoi News: Basic construction projects in North Vietnam in the second quarter were completed 1.9% above the target. The scale of basic construction in the third quarter continues to expand, with 83 industrial and civil projects under construction, many of which are new projects that will commence in the third quarter.
    In the second quarter, the construction department constructed a total of 58 projects, including 36 industrial projects and 22 civil projects. Twelve industrial projects have been completed or substantially completed. Thirteen civil projects have been completed or substantially completed. The quality of basic construction projects in the second quarter met the design requirements; the workload was 382% of the workload in the same period last year. Including the first quarter, the workload in the first half of this year has completed 52% of the annual construction plan.
    Hanoi News: A wave of cultural learning is rising in various parts of North Vietnam. At present, each province has launched a cultural refresher movement to mobilize the broad masses of people and government cadres to participate in cultural learning.
    Last year, the mass education work in North Vietnam was widely developed, basically completing the elimination of illiteracy in the plains areas, laying a good foundation for further promoting the mass cultural learning movement. In June this year, the Ministry of Education of Vietnam convened a meeting of cadres in charge of general education and mass education to conduct a comprehensive review of the general education work and cultural refresher movement over the past year, and formulated a work plan for the future, proposing that the cultural refresher work to improve the cultural level of workers, peasants and cadres should be regarded as the primary and urgent task.
    A recent editorial in the Vietnamese "People's Daily" pointed out that North Vietnam is vigorously promoting socialist transformation and socialist construction, and therefore, the task of raising the cultural level of working people will become more urgent. It is not enough for workers and peasants to just read and write; they require a higher cultural level in order to accept new knowledge, give play to creativity, and improve technology. The editorial pointed out that the cultural refresher movement should first of all become a broad mass movement, mobilizing millions of people to actively participate in learning and teaching; the whole Party and the whole people should recognize and assume the task of promoting the cultural refresher movement.
    Recently, the cultural refresher movement in various provinces of North Vietnam has developed very rapidly. In Hanoi, a model city for eliminating illiteracy, signs of "Civilian-Run Cultural Remedial Classes" can be seen everywhere in streets, alleys and suburban villages. In various government offices and enterprises, great importance is also attached to cultural learning for staff and workers. Since the beginning of this year, hundreds of cultural remedial classes at all levels have been opened. Many units have guaranteed that 100% of the staff who have just escaped illiteracy will participate in cultural learning. The Hanoi Municipal Mass Education Committee recently formulated a two-year cultural remedial work plan, stipulating that students in cultural classes in each township, government office, enterprise and street area should strive to move up a grade each year; requiring leading cadres in suburban townships to complete primary school courses by the end of 1960. Various provinces have formulated their own specific plans to promote the cultural refresher movement. Hung Yen Province has challenged other provinces, guaranteeing that by the end of this year, all people in the province who have escaped illiteracy will have at least a first-grade cultural level, and Party and League members will have a second-grade level. Thanh Hoa Province has also challenged Ninh Binh Province, which was the first to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy, guaranteeing that by the end of this year, 95% of the province's residents will have completed the first and second grade courses, 50% will have completed the third grade course, and 30% will have completed the fourth grade course.

    越南上半年经济建设全面获胜
    国营工业总产值激增　早稻空前丰收
    各地普办进修班提高人民文化水平
    本报讯　据越南“人民报”消息：今年上半年，越南北方在实现国家计划方面，获得巨大的成就。
    在农业生产战线上，由于互助合作运动的发展和巩固以及改进技术运动日益深入，早稻获得了空前大丰收，平均每公顷产量达二千一百公斤稻谷，总产量达到一百七十万吨。和早稻收成最好的1956年相比，今年早稻收获超过1956年二十万吨；和去年同季相比，则超过五十万吨。
    在工业部门，今年上半年国营工业的总产值比去年同期增加了62.3％，比去年下半年增加了3.7％。其中，生产资料的生产比去年同期增加了77％，消费资料的生产增加了54％。地方工业方面，很多地方依靠手工业生产合作社和旧有的生产单位发展地方工业，今年上半年已在各省、县建立起八十多个单位，大部分是一些生产农具、肥料和建筑材料的工场。手工业和私营工业也有相当发展。发展最快的是为基本建设服务的部门（砖、瓦、铁器、铁管等）和生产日用品的行业（织布、缝纫、制袜、自行车零件等）。公私合营的企业，产品质量较前有所提高。
    在基本建设部门，建筑部所属各单位今年上半年完成的施工量，等于去年全年的118％，等于去年同期的350％。
    商业工作的发展也很快。今年上半年人民的购买力有很大提高，国营贸易部门的售货量和去年上半年相比：肉类增加62％，大米增加12％，鲜鱼增加368％，布、绸增加53％，肥皂增加76％。国营贸易部门和供销合作社在各城市和工业区扩大了零售网，并开始在农村就地组织购销，及时满足了人民的需要。
    今年上半年对农民、手工业者个体经济的社会主义改造，对资本主义经济成份的社会主义改造，都有很大进展。今年年初，农业互助合作运动在党的领导下出现了迅速发展的局面。1958年年底，只有占北方农户总数65.6％的农民参加变工组和4.4％的农民加入了农业生产合作社。现在，参加变工组和合作社的农户已占北方农户总数的90％。合作社的数目，从去年年底的四千七百二十二个增加至一万五千个，其中有五百三十五个高级社。今年合作社的早稻普遍生长良好，单位面积产量一般都比单干户的高。
    在过去六个月中，动员手工业者参加生产合作社和生产组的工作也受到更多的重视。截至今年5月止，共有四百六十六个手工业生产合作社、一万七千个生产组。小商小贩中也有8％已组织起来，其中约有三分之一参加了统一经营的合作组，还有一部分参加了兼营生产的供销社。在过去的一段时间里，对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的试点工作，在河内、海防、北宁、富寿等省和鸿广区等地有新的开展。
    本报讯　河内消息：越南北方第二季度的基本建设工程超额1.9％完成。第三季度的基本建设规模继续扩大，将有八十三项工业工程和民用事业工程进行建设，其中有许多是在第三季度里动工兴建的新工程。
    在第二季度，建筑部门施工的工程共有五十八项，其中有三十六项属于工业工程，二十二项属于民用事业工程。工业工程有十二项已经完成或基本上完成。民用事业工程已经有十三项建成或基本上完成。第二季度的基本建设工程质量达到设计要求；工作量为去年同期工作量的382％。连同第一季度计算在内，今年上半年的工作量已完成了全年建筑计划的52％。
    本报讯　河内消息：越南北方各地纷纷掀起学习文化热潮。目前，每个省都先后发动了文化进修运动，动员广大人民和机关干部参加文化学习。
    去年，越南北方的民众教育工作广泛发展，基本上完成了平原地区的扫盲工作，为进一步推动群众性的文化学习运动打下了良好的基础。今年6月间，越南教育部召开普通教育和民众教育工作干部会议，对一年多以来普通教育工作和文化进修运动作了全面的检查，并制订了今后的工作计划，提出把提高工农群众和干部文化水平的文化进修工作当作首要的和迫切的任务。
    越南“人民报”最近发表的社论指出，越南北方正在大力推进社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业，因此，提高劳动人民文化水平的任务，更会显得迫切。工人和农民不是只读会写就够了，他们要求有更高的文化水平，以便接受新的知识，发挥创造性，改进技术。社论指出，首先应该使文化进修运动成为一个广泛的群众性运动，动员千百万人踊跃参加学习和教学工作；要使全党、全民认清和负起推动文化进修运动的任务。
    最近，越南北方各省的文化进修运动发展非常迅速。在扫盲模范城——河内市，各街区、小巷和市郊乡村，到处出现“民办文化补习班”的牌子。在各机关和企业里，对工作人员和工人的文化学习也非常重视，今年年初以来，已经开办了成百个各级文化补习班，许多单位都保证要使刚摆脱文盲的人员百分之百地参加文化学习。河内市民众教育委员会最近制订了今后两年文化补习工作计划，规定每个乡、每个机关、企业和每个街区的文化班学员每年都要争取升一级；要求市郊各乡的领导干部在1960年底学完高小课程。各省都制订了自己促进文化进修运动的具体规划。兴安省向各省提出挑战，保证在今年底，全省已经摆脱文盲的人起码要有一年级文化水平，党、团员要有二年级水平。清化省也向最先完成扫盲任务的宁平省挑战，保证在今年底，该省将有95％的居民读完一年级和二年级课程，50％的居民读完三年级的课程，30％的居民读完四年级的课程。（附图表）
