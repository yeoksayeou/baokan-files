(Xinhua News Agency) Our country's largest blower to date was completed and officially put into production at Anshan Iron and Steel on the 18th. This blower was built for the No. 10 giant blast furnace. Its completion will enable the No. 10 blast furnace to exert greater power and produce more pig iron for the country.

This blower is one of Anshan Iron and Steel's key construction projects this year. The complete set of equipment was supplied by the Soviet Union. Thanks to the direct assistance of Soviet experts in installing this equipment, it only took more than a month. After appraisal by Soviet experts, the project quality reached excellent.

Since the No. 10 giant blast furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel was put into production last November, its production capacity has not been fully utilized due to the small capacity of the blower used. After this giant blower is put into production, it can blow 4,250 cubic meters of wind into the No. 10 blast furnace per minute, so the daily output of pig iron from the No. 10 blast furnace can be greatly increased.

    鞍钢十号高炉配上大鼓风机
    据新华社讯　我国目前最大的一台鼓风机，18日在鞍钢建成正式投入生产。这台鼓风机是为十号巨型高炉建设的。它的建成将使十号高炉发挥出更大的威力，为国家增产更多的生铁。
    这台鼓风机是鞍钢今年基本建设重点工程之一，全套设备都是由苏联供应的。安装这台设备由于得到了苏联专家的直接帮助，前后只用了一个多月的时间。经苏联专家鉴定，工程质量达到优等。
    鞍钢十号巨型高炉自去年11月投入生产以来，由于所用的鼓风机能力太小，生产能力一直不能充分发挥。这台巨型鼓风机投入生产以后，每分钟可以给十号高炉鼓送四千二百五十立方米的风，十号高炉的生铁日产量，因此可以大大增加。
