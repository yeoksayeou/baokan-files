    Don't Let a Second Go to Waste
    Wang Wentao
    We generally calculate time in terms of hours and half-hours, rarely paying attention to minutes or even a single minute. In fact, in modern life, people are already making full use of even the smallest amount of time. A camera can take a picture in one-hundredth of a second, and an electronic computer can complete countless processes in one-thousandth of a second. Talking about one-thousandth of a second may seem a bit far-fetched, so let's stick to one second. A second is the "tick-tock" sound of a clock. One second is one tick. This is what we can hear, about the time it takes us to blink. But in this short time, an ordinary car can travel over a hundred meters, an ordinary airplane can fly over three hundred meters, and if we're talking about a rocket, it goes even further. The Soviet Union's space rocket launched in January of this year travels 11.2 kilometers in that one second.
    I say this because I'm thinking about thrift. Thrift, of course, refers to saving manpower and materials. Materials are actually also manpower, materialized manpower. And saving manpower is actually saving time, striving to do more things in a given amount of time. We emphasize speed in our construction, the so-called "seizing every minute and second," which is actually talking about saving time.
    Speaking of saving time, there are many ways to do it. Asking everyone to save one-thousandth of a second, or that "?" second, may be a bit "too strict," but saving a minute, a few minutes, or a dozen minutes is easy to do. Unfortunately, some people are very dismissive of these "minutes." If a meeting is scheduled for 8 o'clock, they arrive at 8:30 without any embarrassment. A meeting that could be finished in an hour drags on for two or three hours, and people aren't surprised at all. I once encountered this situation in the countryside: a cadre was giving a talk to the masses about drought prevention in the evening. He first spent a lot of time talking about how the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors prevented droughts, putting everyone to sleep. Finally, he said: "Starting tomorrow, we will release water to irrigate the land, paying attention to saving water." The commune members then raised their heads and said: "That's it?" "You could have said that in a few words, but you talked so much first. With the time you spent talking, we could have already irrigated ten mu of land."
    Everything that should be simple should be simple. Saving a minute is saving a minute, saving a second is saving a second. The speed of socialist construction depends on these minutes and seconds. I believe that in saving, we should also loudly call out: "Save time!" For us, seizing time is victory. Of course, there are only three hundred and sixty days in a year, and only twenty-four hours in a day and night. You can't seize an extra minute even if you want to. The "seizing" we're talking about should be the "striving" in "seizing every minute and second," or the "squeezing" in "squeezing time," striving for an extra minute, squeezing out an extra minute, and doing an extra minute of work in all useful time. This is entirely possible.

    一秒钟也不放过
    王文涛
    我们一般都是用一点钟、半点钟计算时间，几分钟、一分钟的时间就很少重视它。其实，在现代生活中，就是极微小的一点时间，人们已经能充分的利用它了。一架照像机在百分之一秒里，可以拍出一张照片，一架电子计算机在千分之一秒里，可以做完数不清的工序。说千分之一秒，未免有些离奇，还是说一秒吧。秒就是钟表里那“嘀嘀嗒嗒”的声音。一秒就是其中的一响。这是我们听得到的，差不多是我们眨一下眼皮的功夫。但是在这个短暂的时间里，普通的汽车可以跑一百多米，普通的飞机可以飞三百多米，如果说到火箭那就跑的更多了，苏联今年1月发射的宇宙火箭，在这一秒里要前进十一点二公里。
    我说这些，是因为想到节约。节约，当然是指节约人力和物力。物力实际上也是人力，是物化了的人力。而节约人力其实就是节约时间，在一定的时间里争取多做一些事情。我们搞建设很强调速度，所谓“分秒必争”，其实这就是说的节约时间。
    提起节约时间，那门路可就多得很。要求人人都节约千分之一秒，或者“?”的那一秒，未免有点“太严”，不过节约一分钟、几分钟、十几分钟那是容易做到的。可惜有些人对这“分”是轻视得很，八点开会，他八点半到，一点也不难为情；一个钟头可以结束的会，拖上两、三个小时，人们一点也不奇怪。有一次在农村就碰到这种情形：有一位干部晚上向群众讲防旱，他先用了很多时间讲扯三皇五帝防旱如何如何，讲得大家都睡了觉。最后他才说：“从明天起放水浇地，注意节约用水。”社员这才抬起头来说：“这不结了。”“三捶两梆子的事，你先说那样多。有你说的这些时间，十亩地早浇完了。”
    一切该简单的就简单，能节约一分钟是一分钟，能节约一秒是一秒，社会主义建设速度的快慢就在这一分一秒之中。我以为在节约中，我们还应该大声疾呼：“节约时间！”对我们来说，夺取时间就是胜利。当然，一年只有三百六十天，一天一夜只有二十四个小时，你想多夺一分也是不行的，我们说的“夺”应该是“分秒必争”的那个“争”字，也可以说是“挤时间”的那个“挤”字，在一切有用的时间里多争一分钟、多挤一分钟、多干一分钟的事情，这是完全可以做到的。
