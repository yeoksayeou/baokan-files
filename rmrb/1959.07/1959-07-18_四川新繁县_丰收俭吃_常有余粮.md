    Chengdu, July 17th (This Newspaper) - Since the bumper harvest last autumn, the people's communes of Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, have adopted methods of rationing food per person, combining coarse and fine grains, and planning food consumption. Commune members have been eating their fill, eating well, and maintaining good health and high spirits.

    Xinfan County, located on the West Sichuan Plain, has experienced bumper harvests of grain last autumn and this summer. How to help the masses arrange their lives in a year of good harvests is a matter of constant and close attention from the Xinfan County Party Committee. After last autumn's harvest, the County Party Committee comprehensively calculated the county's total grain income and expenditure, calling on everyone to know their family wealth, live within their means, and make resources last. According to the spirit of the County Party Committee's instructions, the people's communes at all levels carefully calculated accounts and organized commune members to discuss reasonable methods of distributing grain. After completing the state's grain procurement tasks, setting aside grain for industry, sideline occupations, and seeds, Xinong People's Commune retained enough food grain from last autumn's harvest until this summer's harvest. Everyone decided to implement a method of eating based on individual rations: each canteen divided commune members into several grades according to their labor strength and age, stipulating different grain consumption standards and supplying meals based on these cards. At the same time, corresponding specific measures were formulated, such as eating whatever is produced, combining coarse and fine grains, having both dry and liquid foods, eating more during busy farming seasons and less during slack seasons, eating grains that are not easy to store first, and storing grains that can be stored for a long time for later consumption. Practice in various people's communes throughout the county has proved that the method of rationing food per person not only ensures that everyone can eat their fill and eat well, but also prevents waste and saves grain. After the Fifth Production Management Area of Xinong People's Commune implemented the per-person ration system, it saved more than 9,000 catties of grain per month. At present, summer grain crops such as wheat and potatoes have all been harvested, but the canteens of various communes still have rice to eat, and the whole county still has surplus grain.

    Xinfan is a county that is rich in rice, and has only recently started growing wheat and other miscellaneous grains on a large scale. After last autumn's harvest, the masses created many methods for eating sweet potatoes in a refined way, and now they have made some successful attempts in the ways of eating potatoes with pasta. Qingbai People's Commune uses potatoes and flour to steam steamed buns, which saves fine grains and is fragrant and soft. More than 50 canteens in Xinong People's Commune generally use noodles, cabbage, and potatoes to cook stewed noodles, which are not only plentiful but also nutritious. In the process of eating coarse grains in a refined way and combining dry and liquid foods, the communes often change the variety of staple foods; both quality and quantity are emphasized in terms of vegetables; and some canteens even cook good dishes at the end of each month to add meals for commune members, which makes everyone even more satisfied.

    四川新繁县  丰收俭吃  常有余粮
    本报成都17日电四川省新繁县各人民公社自去年秋季丰收以后，采取以人定量、粗细兼搭、计划用粮的办法，社员一直吃的饱、吃的好，身体健康，心情舒畅。
    川西平原上的新繁县，去秋今夏的粮食都是丰收。在丰收年景中怎样帮助群众安排生活，是中共新繁县委经常密切关注的问题。去年秋收后，县委通盘计算了全县粮食的收支总账，号召大家摸清家底，量入为出，做到细水长流。各人民公社根据县委指示的精神，层层算了细账，组织社员讨论合理支配粮食的办法。新农人民公社除去完成国家征购任务，留下工业、副业用粮和种子以外，从去年秋收直至今年夏收之间，还留下了足够的口粮。大家决定实行以人定量的吃饭办法：各食堂按社员劳动力的强弱和年龄，分成若干等级，规定不同的用粮标准，凭牌供应饭食。同时还相应地制订了产啥吃啥，粗细兼搭，有干有稀，农忙多吃，农闲少吃，不便储藏的粮食先吃，能够长期存放的粮食后吃等具体措施。全县各人民公社的实践证明，以人定量的办法不仅保证人人都能吃饱吃好，而且还可杜绝浪费，节约粮食。新农人民公社第五生产管理区实行以人定量之后，每月节约九千多斤粮食。目前小麦洋芋等夏粮作物都已全部收回，但各公社食堂仍有大米饭吃，全县还有余粮。
    新繁是个盛产水稻的县份，近年才大量种植小麦和其他杂粮。去年秋收后，群众创造了不少关于甘薯细吃的方法，现在又在洋芋与面食的吃法上作了一些成功的尝试。清白人民公社用洋芋和面蒸馒头，既省细粮，又香软可口。新农人民公社的五十多个食堂普遍用面片、莲花白和洋芋一起煮烩面，不但分量多，而且富于营养。在粗粮细吃、干稀兼搭中，各公社都经常调换主食的花色品种；菜蔬方面也质量并重；有些食堂每到月终还做些好菜为社员加餐，大家更为满意。
