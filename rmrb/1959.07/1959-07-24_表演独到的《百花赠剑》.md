The play "Baihua Presents the Sword" is a good one, performed by many different opera genres, but watching the Jin opera version still feels very fresh, especially the image of Princess Baihua created in the Jin opera, which is very unique. Young, beautiful, and proficient in martial arts, these are just her general characteristics; but Princess Baihua is the daughter of the Prince of Anxi, and she also possesses innate arrogance and self-esteem. This play depicts the love between this princess and her subordinate, Military Counselor Hai Jun. The plot seems simple, but the psychological changes of the characters are not, and her identity is particularly difficult to grasp. The performance of the young actress Han Shuying is quite accurate in its nuances, and the image is extremely prominent and moving.

Princess Baihua's entrance is very well done. She faces the side of the audience and walks out with light steps along an invisible parabola. At first, the audience can only see her clothing - a large red hood, a large red cloak - and her graceful figure; at the edge of the stage, she faces the audience, truly a riot of color, but this is only the surface. Jiang Huayou greets her, saying, "Greetings, Princess." She doesn't even look at her, only the corner of her eye moves slightly. Seeing this, one can't help but feel: what a proud princess! Opera performance emphasizes the pose at key moments, especially the first appearance. Here, the audience immediately recognizes the character.

As soon as she enters the room, she smells the scent of wine. This is very unexpected and intolerable to her. Who dares to desecrate her boudoir? Although her back is to the audience, from the actress's back, we can see: the sensitive her has already noticed it. But she doesn't make a fuss. What is she thinking in her heart? At this time, Jiang Huayou helps her take off her coat and presents her with tea. Her fingertip just touches the teacup and immediately pulls away. Her hand gently flickers - the tea is too hot. She doesn't blame the maid, not even glancing at her, but the audience and Jiang Huayou have already felt her reproach. Then, we see her finish the tea and deliberately press the teacup lightly into the saucer. Jiang Huayou's body leans forward slightly, and the princess smells her breath - still because of the "wine"! The connecting thread never breaks, only sometimes appearing and sometimes disappearing.

The development of Princess Baihua's love for Hai Jun is rapid, almost somewhat hasty, but very believable. From her discovery of the "drunkard" and raising her sword to kill him, to forgiving him, and then falling in love with him, it is a sharp turn, without a particularly complicated process, but her emotional changes have a solid psychological basis. In the earlier scene with Jiang Huayou, it seems to be a straightforward portrayal of her arrogance and daintiness, but through these, the audience can already feel that the noble court life has brought her loneliness and spiritual solitude. And the process of her finally falling in love with Hai Jun is also portrayed very delicately in the performance. The changes in the character's inner world can be seen from the actress's eyes.

When the princess gets angry, Hai Jun is so frightened that he crawls out from under the bed. Disturbed by this unexpected event, Princess Baihua draws her sword to kill him. Her eyes are fierce and full of anger, as sharp as the precious sword in her hand; but slowly, like a layer of light mist, the murderous aura is gradually covered. She asks about his origins, learns that he is a military counselor from the Southern Command, and agrees to let him go, but in her heart, she already feels a little attached to him. At this time, through the fan that is half-covering her face, we see her slightly shy, affectionate gaze. Perhaps she has not fully recognized herself, and love has come so quickly, but Jiang Huayou, who is obviously much more experienced than her, has already noticed it. Therefore, when the princess asks her to see where the whitewashed walls are low, she leaves and does not return, and Princess Baihua carries the lamp herself to send him out. After Hai Jun leaves (in fact, he is hiding in the bushes), she suddenly feels as if she has lost something and realizes that she has fallen in love with him. She can't help but shout, "Hai Sheng, where are you?" When Hai Sheng actually appears in front of her, she is slightly startled, almost faint. This sudden event makes her forget her shyness. She boldly stares at him, as if to see through his heart. Finally, she sends Hai Jun away and returns to her room, meeting Jiang Huayou face to face. The reserved princess "poof" blows out the lamp. This action cleverly reveals her innermost thoughts, full of profound meaning.

In "Baihua Presents the Sword", the performance of the young actress Han Shuying is outstanding, with a solid foundation and very delicate expressions. Perhaps she is only accurately reproducing what the teacher taught - it is said to be passed down by the famous old artist Xiao Guitao. Indeed, the performance aspects of opera heritage are exceptionally rich and precious, the careful creation of the older generation of artists. May the comrades of the Youth Jin Opera Troupe study even harder, and we also hope to see more of the performances of famous actors from the Zhangjiakou City Jin Opera Troupe, such as Xiao Guitao, Liu Baoshan, and Guo Shoushan...

    表演独到的《百花赠剑》
    颜长珂
    《百花赠剑》是出好戏，许多剧种都有，但是，再看晋剧，仍然觉得非常新鲜，特别是晋剧中创造的百花公主的形象，很有独到之处。年青、美貌、精通武艺，这些只是她的一般的特点；但百花公主是安西王的女儿，她还有着天生的骄纵和自尊。这出戏描写这位公主和她的部下——参军海俊的爱情，看来情节很单纯，但角色的心理变化并不简单，而尤难掌握的则是她的身份。青年演员韩淑英的表演，分寸相当准确，形象极为突出、动人。
    百花公主在出场就很好，她侧对着观众，顺着一条看不见的抛物线，用轻快的脚步走了出来。起先，观众只能看见她的衣着——大红风帽、大红斗篷——和她那夭矫的身段；到了台口，她面对着观众，真个是花团锦簇，但这还只是表象。江花佑迎她，说：“见过公主。”她看也没看她，只眼角微微地动了一下。看到这里，使人不禁觉得：好骄傲的公主！戏曲表演最讲究亮相，尤其是第一次出场的亮相。这里马上就让观众认识了角色。
    她一进门，就闻到了酒味。这对她是非常意外和难以忍受的，谁敢亵渎她的闺房呢？虽然她背对着观众，从演员的背上，我们能看到：敏感的她已经发觉了。但是她并没有发作，她心里是怎样想的呢？这时，江花佑侍候她脱下了外衣，捧上茶来，她的指尖刚刚碰到茶杯，马上弹开来了，只见她的手轻轻地拂动——茶太烫了。她没有责骂丫头，甚至连瞟她一眼也没有，但观众和江花佑都已感觉到了她的责备。接着，我们看到她喝完了茶，把茶杯放到茶盘里时，故意轻轻地一按，江花佑的身体随着微微前倾，公主正好闻到了她的气息——还是为了“酒”！贯串线始终未断，只是或隐或现而已。
    百花公主与海俊的爱情的发展，迅速得几乎有些匆促，但却非常可信。从她发现“酒徒”、举剑要杀，到宽恕，以至爱上了他，急转直下，没有特别复杂的过程，但她的情绪的变化，却有着坚实的心理基础。在前面她和江花佑的一段戏里，看来是正面写她的傲慢和娇气，但透过这些，观众已能感觉得到：尊贵的宫廷生活给她带来了孤独和心灵的寂寞。而她终于爱上了海俊的过程，在演出中也表现得很细腻，从演员的眼睛里能看到角色内心的变化。
    当公主一生气，海俊吓得从床下钻出来了。被这意外惊扰了的百花公主拔剑就杀，她的目光凶狠、充满愤怒，锐利得就像她掌中的宝剑；但是，慢慢地，像迷蒙了一层轻雾，杀气逐渐被掩盖了。她问了他的来历，知道是南府参军，答应放他出去，而心里已经对他有些留恋了。这时，隔着那半遮着脸的扇子，我们看到了她那略带羞涩的脉脉含情的凝视。也许，她自己还没有完全认识自己，爱情已经如此迅速地来到，但是，显然比她老练得多的江花佑却已窥察到了，所以，在公主要她去看看哪里粉墙低矮的时候，她一走没有回来，百花公主便自己端着灯送他出去。等到海俊走后（其实，他就藏在花丛里），她突然感到好像失去了什么，发现自己已经爱上他了。竟情不自禁地喊起“海生，你在哪里”来了。等到海生果然出现在她面前，她微微一惊，几乎有些昏眩了。这突如其来的事件，使她忘掉了羞涩。她大胆地盯住了他，似乎要洞穿他的心灵，最后，她送走海俊回房，正好和江花佑碰了个对面，矜持的公主“扑”地把灯吹灭了。这个动作巧妙地道出了她的心曲，意味深长。
    在《百花赠剑》里，青年演员韩淑英的表演是出色的，功底很好，表情也很细致；也许她还只是比较准确地再现了老师所教的而已——据说是著名老艺人筱桂桃传授的。的确，戏曲遗产中表演部分是异常丰富而又宝贵的，是前辈艺人精心的创造，愿青年晋剧团的同志们更刻苦地学习，我们也希望能更多地看到张家口市晋剧团的筱桂桃，刘宝山、郭寿山……著名演员的表演。
