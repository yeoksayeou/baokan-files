Where Do 30,000 Kilowatt-Hours of Electricity Come From?
By Our Correspondent Shi Yue'e

	The Shenyang Cable Factory is a factory that requires a large amount of electricity. However, this factory has created outstanding achievements in saving electricity and has become a red banner for saving electricity in the entire city of Shenyang. Now, they can save 30,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity for production every day, which is equivalent to one-third of the factory's electricity consumption.
	How did they save so much electricity? When we visited, we raised this question. A comrade from the factory's electricity saving office enthusiastically told us the story of how an old worker found ways to save electricity for the factory.
	
	The Old Worker's Concern
	This old worker is the station chief of the factory's gas rescue station, named Xu Xichang. He is an old party member in the factory, fifty-one years old this year. Last winter, the Northeast region suffered a severe drought, and the huge turbines of the famous Fengman Hydropower Station were also silent. Relying on the state grid for power supply, the cable factory's production was about to be affected. Under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, the entire factory quickly launched a power generation campaign. Some engaged in wind power generation; some workers relied on their strong bodies to drive the machines. However, how many machines could be driven by wind power and manpower? Old Xu felt as if a stone was pressing on his heart all day long, heavy and heavy. One morning, he walked into the factory with the flow of people, but instead of going to the office or participating in power generation, he stood there absentmindedly, watching the plumes of pungent white gas released from the gas station. As his gaze moved, complex thoughts surged in his mind...
	It turned out that the cable factory had a gas generating station, and the gas produced every day was specially supplied to several workshops such as copper smelting and calendering. However, these workshops could not use it all up every day, especially when the calendering workshop was performing insulation, a large amount of gas would be left unused. Three years ago, the factory, based on his suggestion, transported the excess gas to the gas company, but later this path was blocked due to operational difficulties. Old Xu felt very uncomfortable every day seeing a large amount of gas being wasted. He had thought about using the gas for production. But it always seemed as if someone was saying in his ear: "Isn't it a regression for an electrified factory to switch to using gas?"
	
	A New Attempt
	Now, he is considering this issue again. He thinks that the factory's power supply is temporarily insufficient, and using gas instead of electricity is better than using wind power and manpower. How can a good method be called regression? He told his idea to the branch secretary, who strongly agreed. He also ran to the power workshop to find technician Jia Wenying, who also supported him very much and helped him estimate that using gas instead of electricity could at least solve one-third of the electricity problem. Old Xu boldly put forward his specific idea: "I heard that there is a lead extrusion machine in the rubber wire workshop that needs to be repaired. Let's start by trying the electric furnace on this machine." Jia Wenying said: "Okay!" Saying that, he pulled Xu Xichang to immediately find the director of the rubber wire workshop to discuss this matter in person. From the development process of electric furnaces, they all evolved from burning coal or gas. Therefore, it is entirely possible to convert an electric furnace into a gas furnace. The workshop director readily agreed to their suggestions, but had some concerns about modifying the equipment. He put forward a condition, that is, after the lead extrusion machine is modified to use gas, the workshop will accept the production. Xu Xichang and Jia Wenying felt that this condition was not harsh at all and agreed in unison.
	Modifying the electric furnace device of the lead extrusion machine was the first attempt to replace electricity with gas. The leadership attached great importance to it, and asked the three instructors of the gas rescue station to go all out to assist Xu Xichang in his work. They opened the lead melting furnace of the lead extrusion machine, started modifying it, and the work progressed quickly, completed in less than two days. However, when they repeatedly ignited and observed it once, twice, and three times, they only saw the blue flame disappear immediately like a flash in the pan.
	At night, Old Xu sat in front of the dim light, thinking about the gas furnace modification, and the blue flame "swooshed" in front of his eyes again. He lit his only cigarette and rolled the cigarette packet paper into circles and then into a trumpet shape. Suddenly, he had a flash of inspiration: "Wouldn't changing it to a trumpet shape prevent the flame from going out?"
	The next day, under his personal guidance, the piping group immediately re-produced three nozzles, changing the original iron pipes with the same diameter before and after into a trumpet shape, and according to the opinions of the old worker Ai Chunhe, installed three steel bricks in front of the three nozzles. After such a change, the valve was opened and it ignited at the touch. The firepower was not only strong, but also very concentrated, and the lead melting intensity was also rapidly improved. The degree of automation was exactly the same as before. The workshop accepted the production and was very satisfied.
	
	The Icing on the Cake
	Several months later, most of the equipment in the cable factory that could use gas instead of electricity was converted to use gas. Facts have proved that this is a good way for the cable factory to save electricity by adapting to local conditions in the case of temporary insufficient national power supply. However, the pulp machine, which consumed the most electricity in the entire factory, had not yet used gas instead of electricity because it was the newest equipment and everyone did not dare to modify it easily. Xu Xichang once again raised the question of whether the pulp machine could also be considered for using gas instead of electricity. For this matter, the factory and the workshop were very cautious and held five meetings in a row to repeatedly study it. Finally, it was decided to install another gas furnace on the original furnace to try it out.
	Soon, a gas furnace of the same size as the electric drying machine was built on top of the electric drying furnace of this pulp machine. There were twenty-five nozzles on the left and right sides of the furnace. With the help of technician Liu Xiyuan, the single nozzle was changed to a double-stacked tube, so the flame was strong and the firepower was strong.
	One day in mid-November, people closed the electric furnace. When the gas valve was opened smoothly and the twenty-five nozzles were ignited at the same time, the furnace temperature reached 800 degrees in less than an hour, while it used to take two hours to reach 800 degrees using an electric furnace. Sixty core wires were automatically passing through the gas drying furnace as usual. People rushed to watch the quality of the cable and unanimously believed that its drying degree was uniform and the quality was excellent.
	In this way, in more than half a year, the cable factory used the factory's waste gas to replace electricity with gas, and the daily savings in electricity were equivalent to a power station with a power generation capacity of 2,000 kilowatts, enabling the cable factory to complete the national plans for last year and the first five months of this year ahead of schedule in the case of insufficient power supply.

    三万度电哪里来
    本报记者　史越峨
    沈阳市电缆厂是一个需要大量电力的工厂。可是，这个厂在节约用电上创造了优异的成绩，成为全沈阳市节约用电的一面红旗。现在，他们每天可以节约生产用电三万度，相当全厂用电量的三分之一。
    他们怎样会节约了这样多的电呢？我们去参观的时候，曾经提出了这个问题。工厂节约用电办公室的同志热情地告诉了我们一位老工人如何为工厂寻找节约用电途径的故事。
      老工人的心事
    这个老工人是工厂煤气救护站站长，名叫徐锡昌。他是工厂里的一个老党员，今年五十一岁。去年冬天，东北地区严重干旱，著名的丰满水电站的巨大的水轮机也沉默了。依靠国家电网供电的电缆厂，生产眼看就要受到影响。在厂党委领导下，全厂迅速开展了办电运动，有的搞风力发电；有的工人凭着自己坚实的身体推动机器运转。可是，依靠风力、人力能带动多少机器？老徐心里整天像压着一块石头，沉甸甸的。一天早晨，他随着人流走进工厂，没到办公室，也没去参加发电，却出神地站在那里，望着从煤气站放出来的一股一股刺鼻的白色气体。随着他那视线的移动，错综复杂的思潮在他脑子里奔腾……。
    原来，电缆厂有一座煤气发生站，每天发生的煤气专门供给溶铜、压延等几个车间使用。可是，这几个车间每天都用不完，特别是当压延车间进行保温的时候，就会剩余大量的煤气没处使用。三年前，工厂曾根据他的建议，把多余的煤气输送给煤气公司，可是后来因为操作上的困难，这条道路又被堵塞了。老徐每天看到大量煤气浪费掉，心里很难受。他曾经想过：把煤气使用在生产上。可是总好像有个人在他耳旁说：“电气化的工厂改用煤气那不是倒退了吗？”
      新的尝试
    现在，他又在考虑这个问题。他想工厂电力暂时供应不足，用煤气代电力总比用风力、人力强得多，好办法怎么能叫后退呢？他把他的想法告诉了支部书记，支部书记十分赞成。他又跑到动力车间找技术员贾文英，贾文英也非常支持他，并且帮助他估算了一下，认为用以煤代电的办法起码可以解决三分之一的电力。老徐又大胆地提出了他的具体想法：“听说橡皮线车间有一台压铅机要检修，先从这台机器的电炉开始试试看行不行？”贾文英说：“行！”说着，拉着徐锡昌立刻去找橡皮线车间主任当面商量这件事。从电炉的发展过程来看，都是从烧煤或煤气进展来的，因此将电炉改成煤气炉是完全可能的。车间主任一口同意了他们两人的建议，只是对改设备有些顾虑。他提出了一个条件，就是压铅机改装煤气之后，由车间验收生产。徐锡昌和贾文英觉得这个条件一点也不苛刻，同声应承了。
    改装压铅机的电炉装置，是煤气代电的第一次尝试，领导上十分重视，要煤气救护站的三个指导员全力以赴，协助徐锡昌一道工作。他们打开压铅机的溶铅炉，动手改装，工作进行得很快，不到两天就完成了。可是，当他们一次、两次、三次反复点火观察时，只见蓝色的火焰昙花一现似的立即消失了。
    晚上，老徐坐在微弱的灯光面前，想着改煤气炉的事，蓝色的火焰又在眼前“嗉嗉”地跳动了。他点燃了仅有的一根纸烟，把那张烟盒纸，时儿卷成圆圈，时儿卷成喇叭形，忽然灵机一动：“改成喇叭形不是就不会断焰了吗？”。
    第二天，在他亲自指导下，配管小组马上重新赶制了三个喷嘴，把原来前后一样直径的铁管，改为喇叭形，并根据老工人艾春和的意见，在三个喷嘴前面安装了三块钢砖。经过这样一改，阀门一开，一触即着，火力不仅旺盛，而且很集中，溶铅强度也很快地提高了，自动化程度完全和以前一样。车间验收生产，十分满意。
    锦上添花
    几个月之后，在电缆厂凡是可以煤气代电的设备大都改用了煤气，事实证明了这是电缆厂在国家电力暂时供应不足的情况下，因地制宜节约用电的好办法。可是，全厂用电量最多的一台纸浆机，因为是最新的设备，大家不敢轻易改动，因此还没有使用煤气代电。徐锡昌又提出了纸浆机是否也可考虑以煤气代电。对于这一件事，工厂和车间都十分慎重，一连开了五次会，反复研究，最后决定在原来的炉子上另装一个煤气炉试试看。
    不久，这台纸浆机的电气干燥炉顶上，建起了一座和电气干燥机同等大小的煤气炉，炉子左右有二十五个喷嘴。在技术员刘希元的帮助下，又把单喷嘴改为双叠管，因此火苗硬，火力旺。
    11月中旬的一天，人们关闭了电炉，当煤气阀门畅开，二十五根喷嘴同时点火的时候，加热不到一个小时，炉温就达到八百度，而过去使用电炉一般都要加热两个小时才能达到八百度。六十根线芯正自动地像往常那样通过煤气干燥炉，人们涌过去观看电缆的质量，一致认为它的干燥程度匀，质量优良。
    就这样，电缆厂在半年多的时间内，利用工厂废弃煤气，以煤气代电力，每天节约的电力相当于一座二千瓩发电能力的电站，使电缆厂在电源不足的情况下，提前完成了去年和今年头五个月的国家计划。
