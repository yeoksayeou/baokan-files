    Summarize the Experience of Spring Wheat High Yield

    Spring wheat has turned yellow and is being harvested from south to north. After more than three months of hard work, this year's spring wheat is growing very well. In Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, the stalks are chest-high, with many and full grains; in Inner Mongolia, the plants are tall and strong, with neat ear types; in the northernmost Heilongjiang, after overcoming a severe drought, most seedlings are complete and strong, with thick roots and fat leaves, and have begun to head. Seriously summarizing the experience of spring wheat high yield is an important task. Because spring wheat is scattered in the vast areas of Northeast, Northwest, and North China, it is one of the main food crops in these areas. In Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia, spring wheat accounts for one-eighth to one-half of the sown area of food crops, and other provinces such as Jilin, Liaoning, Shanxi, and Hebei also account for a certain amount. Summarizing the experience of spring wheat high yield is of great significance for these regions to develop spring wheat next year and strive for a bumper harvest of spring wheat next year.

    Special emphasis on summarizing the experience of spring wheat high yield is also because spring wheat has its special growing environment and special laws. As we know, China's spring wheat is planted in the north where winter temperatures are low and the frost-free period is short. To adapt to this special condition, the varieties of spring wheat, as well as the measures of dense planting, fertilization, and irrigation that come with different varieties, are also different; in addition, the growth period of spring wheat is short, and it is intertwined with the sowing, management, and harvesting periods of other summer-sown and autumn-sown crops. How to plant, manage, and harvest spring wheat well, change the past habits of rough planting, rough management, and rough harvesting, and in the case of labor shortage, is also a very important issue.

    From a national perspective, the yield per unit area of spring wheat has always been higher than that of winter wheat. Spring wheat should be actively developed in spring wheat producing areas. But in reality, the sown area of spring wheat has not been rising over the years, but has been decreasing year by year. Some provinces even decreased by 35.7% in 1958 compared to 1952. This year is a glorious page in the history of spring wheat in our country. Its sown area has not decreased but increased, not only more than in 1958, but also 4% higher than in 1957. Moreover, all localities have carried out careful management of it, especially Inner Mongolia's prevention and control of wheat stem sawfly and emergency eradication of rust disease, and Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning's victory over severe drought, which has greatly enriched the experience of spring wheat planting and management. At this time of harvesting, it is recommended that all localities seize the opportunity, according to local specific characteristics, and in accordance with local conditions, deeply summarize these experiences to promote the movement of spring wheat high yield next year.

    总结春小麦丰产经验
    春小麦已经纷纷黄熟，正自南向北开镰收割。经过三个多月来的奋战，今年春小麦生长得很好。甘肃、青海、宁夏的秆高齐胸，粒多、粒饱；内蒙古的植株高大健壮，穗型整齐；最北部的黑龙江，在击退大旱以后，绝大部分苗全苗壮，根粗叶肥，已开始抽穗。认真总结春小麦丰产经验，是一项重要工作。因为春小麦分散种在东北、西北和华北广大地区，是这些地区的主要粮食作物之一。青海、甘肃、宁夏、黑龙江、内蒙古春小麦在粮食作物播种面积中的比例分别占到八分之一到二分之一，其他像吉林、辽宁、山西、河北等省也占一定数量。总结春小麦丰产经验，对这些地区明年发展春小麦，争取明年春小麦的大丰收有重大作用。
    特别提出总结春小麦丰产经验，还因为春小麦有它生长的特殊环境和特殊规律。我们知道，我国春小麦都是种植在冬季温度低，无霜期短的北方。为适应这种特殊条件，春小麦的品种以及随着品种要求不同而来的密植、施肥、灌水等等措施也有所不同；加上春小麦生长期短，和其他夏种、秋种作物的播种、管理、收获期交织在一起。如何把春小麦种好、管好和收好，改变过去粗种、粗管和粗收的习惯，在劳力缺乏情况下，也是一个十分重要的问题。
    从全国看来，历年来春小麦的单位面积产量都高于冬小麦。在春小麦产地应该积极发展春小麦。但实际上春小麦播种面积历年来不是上升，而是逐年减少。有的省1958年竟比1952年减少35.7％。今年是我国春小麦历史上光荣的一页，它的播种面积不是减少而是增加了，不但比1958年种得多，比1957年也高出4％。而且各地对它进行了细心的管理，特别是内蒙古防治麦秆蝇和突击扑灭锈病，黑龙江、吉林、辽宁战胜大旱，从而大大丰富了春小麦的种植管理经验。当此纷纷收割之际，建议各地抓住时机，根据当地具体特点，因地制宜地、深入地总结这些经验，以促进明年春小麦的丰产运动。
