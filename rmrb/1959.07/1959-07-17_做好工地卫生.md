    Do a Good Job of Hygiene on Construction Sites

On national capital construction and water conservancy construction sites, hundreds of thousands of construction workers and rural laborers are concentrated. If hygiene work is not given attention, it is possible to spread diseases and affect the progress of the projects. To do a good job in hygiene on construction sites, various measures must be taken based on the characteristics of the sites. Facts have shown that many construction sites have done a good job in hygiene work, ensuring improved work efficiency and the completion of construction plans on schedule or ahead of schedule. Most of these construction sites conducted physical examinations of employees during team organization before construction began and properly dealt with sick individuals and those carrying bacteria, which prevented the spread of diseases on the construction sites. Many construction sites also established medical and health care networks in daily life and work, combining them with construction site labor organizations to carry out mass hygiene campaigns. They also focused on important aspects of collective life such as food hygiene and excrement disposal, strictly controlling sources of disease. According to the season and past work, Beijing's construction sites have chosen to control the most easily occurring and most dangerous intestinal infectious diseases on the sites. Because some construction sites have done a good job in all aspects, they have ensured that employee attendance rates are consistently above 98%. These experiences are worth learning from. It is true that there are many difficulties in carrying out hygiene work on construction sites. However, in order to ensure the health of employees and smoothly complete construction tasks, it is necessary to carefully study the experiences of various regions, address the characteristics of the construction sites, overcome difficulties, and do a good job in environmental sanitation and hygiene work in collective life.

    做好工地卫生
    在全国基本建设和水利建设工地上，集中了成千上万的建筑工人和农村来的民工，如果稍不注意卫生工作，就有可能传染疾病，影响工程的进度。要做好工地的卫生工作，就要根据工地特点，采取各种措施。事实表明，许多工地已经把卫生工作做好，保证了工效的提高和施工计划的如期或提前完成。这些工地大多在开工以前，结合编队，对职工普遍地作了体格检查，并妥善处理了患病者和带病菌的人，这就防止了在工地上传染疾病。不少工地在日常生活和劳动中，还结合工地劳动组织，建立医疗保健网，开展群众性的卫生运动；并且特别抓住集体生活中的饮食卫生和粪便处理等重要环节，严格控制了病源。北京市各建筑工地更根据季节和过去工作开展的基础，选择每一时期工作的重点，有效地控制了工地最易发生、危害最严重的肠道传染病。有些工地由于做好了各方面的工作，就保证了职工出勤率经常在百分之九十八以上。这些经验都是值得吸取的。在工地开展卫生工作，确有许多困难。但是，为了保证职工的健康，顺利地完成建设任务，就要认真研究各地经验，针对工地特点，克服困难，做好环境卫生、集体生活中的卫生工作。
