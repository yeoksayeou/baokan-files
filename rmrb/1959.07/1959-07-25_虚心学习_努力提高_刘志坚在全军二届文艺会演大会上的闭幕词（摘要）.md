Learn Humbly, Strive to Improve
Liu Zhijian's Closing Speech at the All-Army Second Art Performance Convention (Abstract)

    This newspaper reports that Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered the following speech at the closing ceremony of the All-Army Second Art Performance Convention:
    Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian first congratulated the convention on its success on behalf of the General Political Department. He then said: This convention is a great review of the achievements of the leap forward in the army's art work. Twenty-one professional art troupes and sixteen amateur performance teams participated in the convention, performing 408 programs, including: 23 dramas, 18 dance dramas, 10 operas, 7 living newspapers, 6 local operas, 78 dances, 30 large choruses, 51 male and female small choruses, 34 male and female solo songs, 24 performance songs, 21 instrumental ensembles, 22 instrumental solos, 13 poem performances, 2 statue performances, 40 Quyi performances, and 29 acrobatics performances. These programs comprised 62 evenings, with a total of 288 performances. Compared with the first All-Army Art Performance Convention in 1952, this convention has seen a significant increase in both the quantity and quality of programs, with many programs of high ideological and artistic quality, and a good combination of content and form. Generally speaking, most programs have achieved different degrees of success, marking a great harvest in the army's art work.
    From this convention, it can be seen that the army's art work has resolutely implemented the Party's policy of serving proletarian politics. The vast majority of the programs are ideologically sound, reflecting the struggles and life of the army in various aspects; better reflecting the Great Leap Forward; praising good people and good deeds; depicting the history of the revolutionary war; shaping many extremely touching heroic images; extolling revolutionary heroism and the great communist spirit; and elaborating on the glorious tradition of unity between officers and soldiers and unity between the army and the people. It has effectively played the role of publicity and education in art work. In terms of artistic form, it is a hundred flowers blooming, rich and colorful, with a distinct national style and military characteristics.
    The convention has yielded great gains. The fundamental reasons are the result of the rectification campaign and the "anti-rightist" struggle; the result of implementing the Party's literary and artistic policies; the result of liberating thinking and bold creation; the result of professional art workers going down to the grassroots level to temper themselves and delve into struggles and life; the result of extensively carrying out mass amateur art activities and following the mass line; the result of professional guidance for amateurs, amateurs enriching professionals, mutual learning, and common improvement; and, more importantly, the result of the attention and strengthened leadership of art work by party committees and responsible comrades at all levels. Many programs in the convention have either been discussed and studied by leading organs or have been personally guided by responsible comrades, thus ensuring the quality of creation and performance.
    While affirming our achievements, we must face up to our shortcomings and deficiencies and must not be complacent. Some programs are still relatively rough, and the ideological content and artistic expression are not profound or refined enough. Even the better programs still have varying degrees of shortcomings that need to be further processed and improved; amateur art activities are not yet widespread or regular enough; many professional art workers have not improved their political and ideological awareness, artistic cultivation, and technical training quickly enough, have not delved deep enough into life, and have not observed life widely, deeply, or thoroughly enough. These shortcomings must be diligently improved.
    The tasks before our army's art work are: to continue to popularize and vigorously carry out mass amateur art activities, and to strive to improve on this basis. We must do a good job in the work of grassroots clubs, so that amateur art activities can be maintained regularly. Amateur performance teams should be widely organized on the principle of need, voluntariness, and possibility. The art backbones that have emerged in the convention should be organized and cultivated to give full play to their role. Professional art workers should continue to strengthen political study and artistic cultivation, strengthen basic technical training and artistic practice, delve into struggles and life, humbly learn from the masses, and strengthen guidance to amateur art activities. The good programs in this convention should be vigorously promoted in the army; at the same time, we must strengthen creative leadership, cultivate creative backbones, and strive to improve the quality of creation. Comrades, as long as we resolutely implement the Party's literary and artistic policies, earnestly summarize the experience of this convention and the art work since the rectification campaign, learn humbly, and work hard, our army's art work will surely achieve new and greater achievements.

    虚心学习  努力提高
    刘志坚在全军二届文艺会演大会上的闭幕词（摘要）
    本报讯　中国人民解放军总政治部副主任刘志坚中将在全军二届文艺会演闭幕大会上的讲话摘要如下：
    刘志坚中将首先代表总政治部祝贺会演的成功。接着，他说：这次会演，是部队文艺工作跃进成绩的大检阅。参加会演的有二十一个专业文工团和十六个业余演出队，演出节目四百零八个，计有：话剧二十三个，舞剧十八个，歌剧十个，活报剧七个，地方戏曲六个，舞蹈七十八个，大合唱三十个，男女声小合唱五十一个，男女声独唱三十四个，表演唱二十四个，器乐合奏二十一个，器乐独奏二十二个，诗表演十三个，塑像表演二个，曲艺四十个，杂技二十九个，这些节目组成六十二个晚会，共演出二百八十八场。这次会演，比起1952年全军首届文艺会演，节目的数量和质量都有显著的提高，出现了许多思想性、艺术性较高、内容和形式结合得较好的节目。总的说来，绝大部分节目都有不同程度的成就，是部队文艺工作的一次大丰收。
    从这次会演来看，部队文艺工作坚决贯彻了党的文艺为无产阶级政治服务的方针。演出的绝大部分节目，都是思想健康，从各个方面表现了军队的斗争和生活；较好的反映了大跃进；表扬了好人好事；描写了革命战争史；塑造了许多极为感人的英雄形象；歌颂了革命英雄主义和伟大的共产主义精神；阐扬了我军官兵一致、军民一致的光荣传统。有效的发挥了文艺工作的宣传教育作用。在艺术形式上，百花齐放、丰富多彩，具有鲜明的民族风格和部队特色。
    这次会演收获很大，其根本原因，是整风“反右”的结果；是贯彻执行党的文艺方针的结果；是解放思想、大胆创造的结果；是专业文艺工作者下放锻炼深入了斗争和生活的结果；是广泛开展群众性业余文艺活动走群众路线的结果；是专业辅导业余，业余丰富专业，互相学习、共同提高的结果；更重要的是由于各级党委和负责同志对文艺工作的重视和加强领导。会演中的许多节目，或者经过领导机关的讨论和研究，或者经过负责同志的亲自指导，因而保证了创作和演出的质量。
    在肯定成绩的同时，必须正视我们的缺点和不足之处，绝不能骄傲自满。有些节目还比较粗糙，思想内容和艺术表现还不够深刻、不够精练，即使较好的节目，也还存在着不同程度的缺点，需要继续加工提高；业余文艺活动还不够普遍、不够经常；不少专业文艺工作者在政治思想、艺术修养和技术训练方面都还提高的不够快，深入生活不够，对生活的观察不广，理解不深、不透。这些缺点都必须努力改进。
    摆在我们部队文艺工作面前的任务是：继续普及、大力开展群众性业余文艺活动，并在这个基础上努力提高。把基层俱乐部工作搞好，使业余文艺活动保持经常。业余演出队要在需要、自愿和可能的原则下，广泛地组织起来，会演中涌现出来的文艺骨干，应当加以组织培养，充分发挥他们的作用。专业文艺工作者要继续加强政治学习和艺术修养，加强基本技术训练和艺术实践，深入斗争和生活，虚心向群众学习，加强对业余文艺活动的辅导。这次会演中的好节目，要在部队中大力推广；同时，要加强创作领导，培养创作骨干，努力提高创作质量。同志们，只要我们坚决贯彻党的文艺方针，认真总结这次会演和整风以来的文艺工作的经验，虚心学习，刻苦钻研，我军文艺工作一定会获得新的更大的成就。
