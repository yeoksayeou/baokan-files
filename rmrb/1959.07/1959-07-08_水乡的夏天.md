Summer has arrived, and the lake water is rising rapidly.

As the water rises, fish are drawn to shallower waters, making it the perfect season for fishermen on Poyang Lake. As the saying goes, "Fish pass like geese." Who would miss such a profitable season? The Yuye (Fishery) Production Team of Duchang Town Commune in Jiangxi Province seized this opportunity, dispatching forty-two boats to begin their intensive summer fishing production on Poyang Lake.

The morning light scattered from the cracked clouds onto the lake, and countless fishing boats swayed on the water. Some fishermen hunched over, chests pressed against the bow, their hands steadily pulling and releasing the hooks on the surface of the lake. Others rowed with continuous strokes of their arms. Many pairs of hopeful eyes were focused intently on the "buoys" on the water. Despite so many people being present, there was barely a sound to be heard on the lake, as if even a cough would cause the fish to escape the hooks. ...

"Songyuan, the weather's turning for a storm!" A fishing boat cut across from an angle, and an old fisherman with silver hair standing on the bow called out to a young man on another boat.

"Yes, Uncle Shizhen must have made a good run today!" The young man called Songyuan replied while baiting his hooks. Uncle Shizhen felt rather uncomfortable hearing this, and couldn't help but retort, "Just because you're the captain now, you start teasing Uncle Shizhen."

Shizhen said Songyuan was teasing him, which at first didn't quite make sense. It turned out that something like this had happened a few days prior.

As the summer flood season was about to arrive, the commune's Party committee launched a labor competition with daily evaluations and monthly comparisons. At the rally, production team leader Chao Songyuan, in order to ignite everyone's enthusiasm for work, was the first to propose a production increase target of five hundred jin per day, and challenged Yu Shizhen, a well-known fishing expert and top-notch fisherman on Poyang Lake, by name. When Shizhen saw that it was Captain Chao, whom he always considered young and inexperienced, he didn't say anything, but he inwardly sneered. So, a bright red challenge letter was quickly posted.

As soon as the rally ended, a layer of dark clouds rose from the southwest corner, indicating that a big storm was coming. Shizhen looked at the sky and thought, "Chao, you've already lost this challenge!" Based on his experience, Shizhen knew that there would be a storm today, and had already set his hooks in the shallow waters of the lake. But Captain Chao hadn't anticipated this. Seeing the weather change, he thought: if he didn't rush to move the hooks from the deep water to the shallow water before the storm, tomorrow's daily production would be reduced, and the first day of the challenge would be a failure. Thinking of this, Captain Chao ran to the lake like a shot, wishing he could step onto the boat in one stride. As soon as he started the boat, he wanted to retrieve all eight thousand hooks and reset them in the shallows. ...

The wind stirred up surging waves on the lake, and torrential rain fell from the sky like millions of flying arrows. Captain Chao and his fishing boat rose and fell together in the storm. Waves and raindrops turned Captain Chao into a "drenched chicken." Although the rain was icy cold, the heat in his heart kept him from feeling it at all. "This kid is really putting in the effort!" Shizhen praised, watching Captain Chao's boat. Soon, Captain Chao quickly reset more than eight thousand hooks from the deep water to the shallows. The next day, Captain Chao and Shizhen were both baiting hooks on the lake island. Lively, fresh fish were pulled from the water, and the harvest made them feel that the fish scales were emitting an enticing fragrance. But when Shizhen saw that the fish Captain Chao was pulling out of the water were bigger and more numerous than his own, he couldn't help but feel a little envious. He regretted not having set his hooks on the shallows before the rain yesterday. In the afternoon, the fishery team announced the results of the day's evaluation: "Captain Chao produced six hundred and seventy jin, taking first place; Shizhen produced five hundred and twenty-one jin, taking second place." After this incident, anyone on Poyang Lake who said Shizhen was a production expert would be considered to be teasing him.

That was the situation today. When Captain Chao said, "Uncle Shizhen must have made a good run today," he thought of what had happened last time. This time, Shizhen was not going to show weakness. He secretly resolved, "If I can't surpass Captain Chao in daily production this time, I won't be worthy of being an old hand who's been fishing on Poyang Lake for more than thirty years." As he thought about it, he felt an indescribable discomfort in his heart. "It's understandable if others tease me, but especially Chao Songyuan, this kid, is also teasing me. Has he forgotten that I was a friend who shared life and death with his father?" At this moment, the past flashed before Shizhen's eyes like waves on the lake, one layer after another: ...During the Anti-Japanese War, Shizhen and Captain Chao's father, Chao the Elder, shared a broken fishing boat. During the day, they had to avoid the Japanese boats, and at night, they had to be careful of the Kuomintang army firing guns. They had endured hardship and suffering, and looked forward to the arrival of the Communist Party. The land reform gave Shizhen and Chao the Elder each their own fishing boat. Later, when the village established mutual aid teams, elementary cooperatives, advanced cooperatives, and communes, Shizhen and Chao the Elder were among the first or second in the village to write applications. Last year, Chao the Elder unfortunately passed away. Seeing his old friend's son on the lake gave Shizhen a great deal of comfort. "How can he tease me today without any regard for seniority? Sigh! He's a captain now, and he doesn't even look at me anymore." Shizhen couldn't help but murmur to himself while baiting his hooks. In fact, Captain Chao didn't intentionally tease him. Young people, after all, are just inherently thoughtless when they speak. From then on, Shizhen would argue with Captain Chao after just a few words. Even though Captain Chao had explained to him several times, it was like "pouring water on a duck's back - a waste of time."

A few days later, one evening, the weather was so humid that people were drenched in sweat, and another storm was brewing in the southwest. It looked like a big storm was coming soon. The fishermen had finished baiting their hooks and were starting to return, carrying a boatload of shimmering silver fish. As the boat reached the center of the lake, a gust of wind like ten thousand horses galloping suddenly stirred up waves more than ten feet high. Thunder and rain struck down like splitting bamboo, and countless fishing boats were tossed about in the giant waves. Young, strong lads were different in the storm! Captain Chao's boat was the first to reach the upwind shore, and the others followed suit one after another. Looking around: where was Shizhen's boat? People all cried out in unison: "Shizhen, where's Shizhen?" When Captain Chao heard this, he knew that Shizhen was old and lacked strength, and his boat must have been driven downwind by the waves. Thinking of this, he was more anxious than an ant on a hot pot. There was no time to wait any longer. Captain Chao quickly raised the anchor, unfurled the sail, and, forgetting himself, rowed the boat toward the center of the lake with the boatman Lao Wang. In a moment, they disappeared into the surging waves. A wave, like a small mountain, crashed down on Captain Chao's boat. The fishing boat was lifted high into the sky by the waves, and then plunged to the bottom of the deep lake. The two oars in Captain Chao's hands flew through the waves. Although he was sweating profusely, his determination gave him more strength.

Shizhen's forehead was covered with sweat the size of soybeans, and his wrinkled face turned pale. He thought, "The boat is the property of the collective, and I must not let it be sunk by the waves. I must return." His determination made him fight on the lake for half an hour, but in the end, he was too old and weak. The waves were getting stronger and stronger, forcing him downwind. He was just about to lose his grip! His hands loosened, and with a "whoosh," a large wave engulfed the entire boat.

"Shizhen, don't be afraid, I'm coming!" Just at this critical moment, Captain Chao's voice suddenly swept past his ear. Shizhen's heart lit up, and he immediately raised the oar and steered the boat toward Captain Chao's boat. Captain Chao deftly used a hook to grab Shizhen's fishing boat, and rowed with all his might. The boat reached the upwind shore! Captain Chao and Shizhen jumped onto the shore at the same time, and pulled the two boats ashore in one breath. "We're safe!" Shizhen took a deep breath, stretched out his hand and tightly grasped Captain Chao's hand, his eyes glistening with tears of emotion...

After a while, the thunderstorm passed, and the waves on the lake gradually calmed down. Captain Chao and Shizhen's two fishing boats returned victoriously...

    水乡的夏天
    雷鞭
    入夏了，湖水迅速地上涨着。
    水涨鱼发窝，正是鄱阳湖上渔民们捕鱼的好季节。俗话说“鱼过如雁”。谁肯错过这样的旺季呢！江西都昌镇公社渔业生产队抓住这个时机，四十二条船出发了，在鄱阳湖上开始了紧张的夏季捕鱼生产。
    晨曦从裂了缝的云层里撒落在湖上，无数只渔船在湖上荡漾。渔民们有的伏着身子，胸膛紧贴着船头，手在湖水面上一收一放地排钩；有的双臂不停地一伸一屈的划着桨；多少双充满希望的目光，全神贯注地凝视着水面上的“浮筒”。人虽然这么多，湖面上却听不出一点声息，似乎连咳嗽一声，鱼儿就会脱钩逃走一样。……
      “松元呀，天气又要打风暴啦！”一条渔船从斜面穿过来，站在船头上的一位银白头发的老渔人朝着另一条渔船头上的小伙子说。
      “是呀，式珍伯今天又走了一脚好的呗！”被唤作松元的小伙子边排钩边回答。式珍伯听了心里怪不好受，禁不住随口就顶了上去：“真是当了队长啦，开口就羞起式珍伯来了。”
    式珍伯说松元是羞他，乍一听来叫人还摸不着头脑。原来前几天发生过这样一件事情。
    当夏汛刚要到来，公社党委提出了日评月比的劳动竞赛。在誓师会上，生产队长巢松元为了激发大家的劳动热情，第一个提出日产五百斤的增产指标，点名和鄱阳湖上的生产能手、数一数二的捕鱼老将余式珍挑战。式珍伯一见是他一向认为年轻经验少的巢队长，口里没说什么，心里倒有几分冷笑，于是一张鲜红的应战书很快地贴了出来。
    誓师会刚开完，眼看西南角上飞起了一层乌云，大风暴快来到了。式珍伯看着天色，心里想：“挑战，这回你就输了一着啦！”原来，式珍伯凭自己的经验，早知道今天要打风暴，渔钩早张好在湖上的浅水里。可是巢队长却没料到这一着，现在眼看天气变了，心想：如果不在风暴前，抢着把钩由深水里改张到浅水里去，明天的日产量就会降低，挑战的第一天就会失败。巢队长想到这里，像飞一样地跑向湖边，恨不得一步就跨上渔船，一开船就把八千张渔钩全部收回来，改张到浅水里去。……
    风在湖上掀起了澎湃的浪涛，暴雨像千万支飞箭从天上射下来，巢队长和他的渔船在风浪里一起一伏，浪花和雨点把巢队长变成个“落汤鸡”。雨水虽然冷冰冰的，可是心里的热潮，却使他一点也没有感觉到。“这小子真卖劲呀！”式珍伯望着巢队长的渔船，不由得称赞了一句。一会儿，八千多张渔钩，很快在巢队长手上由深水改张到浅水的洪头上了。第二天，巢队长和式珍伯同在湖洲上排钩，一条条活泼泼的鲜鱼被啄出水面，丰收使他们觉得鱼鳞在散发着诱人的香气。可是式珍伯看到巢队长啄出水的鱼儿比自己又多又大，眼里总不免有些发红。他反悔自己昨天雨前没有把钩张上洪头。下午，渔业队公布这天的日评结果是：“巢队长日产六百七十斤，占第一位；式珍伯日产五百二十一斤，占第二位。”从这件事情发生之后，鄱阳湖上谁要说了式珍伯是生产能手，他就认为谁在羞他。
    今天就是这样，当巢队长一说“式珍伯今天又走了一脚好的呗”，心里就想起了上回发生的那件事。这回式珍伯可不示弱啦，他暗暗地下定决心，“这回在日产上要超不过巢队长，也算不了在鄱阳湖上捕了三十多年鱼的老手。”想着想着，心里老是有一股说不出的难受，“别人羞我到情有可原，特别是巢松元这小子也羞起我来。难道他忘了我是和他父亲共过生死的朋友吗？”这时，往事像湖上的波浪，一层紧一层地在式珍伯的眼前掠过：……在抗日战争那时期，式珍伯就和巢队长的父亲巢老大共驾着一条破渔船，在湖上白天既要躲避日本佬的汽船，晚上又要当心国民党的军队打枪，一直出生入死，熬苦受难地盼到共产党来了，土改使式珍伯和巢老大都各有了自己的渔船。往后村里办互助组、建初级社、转高级社、公社，式珍伯和巢老大都是村里第一、第二个写申请的人。去年巢老大不幸去世了，式珍伯能在湖上看到老朋友的儿子，心里也总算是得到不少的安慰。“怎么今天竟无大无小的羞起我来呢？唉！当队长啦，现在连我也瞧不在眼里了。”式珍伯不自禁地边排钩边自言自语地说出了声。其实，巢队长也并不是有心羞他，年轻人吧，生成就是这个说话不加思索的性子。从此式珍伯对巢队长三句话说不上就顶开了。那怕巢队长向他作了几次解释，也是“鸭子背上浇水——空事”。
    几天后的一个傍晚，天气蒸得人汗淋淋的，西南方又卷起了风暴。看样子大风暴就快来了，渔民们排完钩正载着一船银光闪闪的鲜鱼开始返航。船开到湖心，突然一阵像万马奔腾似的狂风，掀起了丈多高的浪头，雷雨劈竹子似的落下来，无数条渔船在巨浪里颠簸着。年轻力壮的小伙子在风暴里可不同啦！巢队长的渔船第一个抢靠了上风岸，继后大家才先后跟着抢了上来。一看：式珍伯的渔船呢？人们都不约而同地惊叫了一声：“式珍伯，式珍伯呢？”巢队长一听，就知道式珍伯人老力不足，船一定被浪打往下风去了。想到这里，心里急的比热锅上的蚂蚁还要急。现在再不能等待了，巢队长迅速地拉起锚，撑开船和稍公老王，忘我地把船划向湖心，一会就消失在澎湃的湖涛中。浪像一座小山似的，猛向巢队长的船上扑来，渔船一会被浪抬上了高空，一会被降落在深深的湖底，巢队长手上的两条桨在波涛里飞舞着，人虽然累得满头大汗，可决心却使他增添了许多力量。
    式珍伯满头冒着黄豆大的汗珠，布满皱纹的脸上变得苍白，想着：“船是社里的财产，我一定不能让它被浪花打沉，我一定要返航。”决心使他在湖面上斗争了半个钟头，但终于年老力衰，浪头一阵紧一阵的把他逼往下风，刚刚支不住啦！双手一松，“哗啦”一个高浪盖住了整个船身。
    “式珍伯，别怕，我来啦！”正在这千钧一发之际，巢队长的声音突然在他耳边掠过。式珍伯心里一亮，立即飞起桨，把船朝巢队长的船边靠去。巢队长敏捷地趁手一啄钩，就将式珍伯的渔船钩住了，尽力划了几桨，船靠上风岸了！巢队长和式珍伯同时一个箭步跳上岸，一口气把两条船拉上了岸。“脱险啦！”式珍伯深深地吸了口气，伸出手紧紧的拉着巢队长的手，眼眶内禁不住闪烁着激动的泪花……
    一会儿，雷雨过去了，湖上的浪涛渐渐的平静了下来，巢队长和式珍伯的两条渔船胜利返航了……
