    Aba Establishes a Healthcare Network Throughout the Prefecture
    Reduced Disease, Flourishing Population

    (Our report) Before liberation, the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture had only seven rudimentary medical institutions. Now, it is establishing a healthcare network that spans the entire prefecture.

    Currently, the Aba Autonomous Prefecture has established 211 healthcare institutions, more than thirty times the number before liberation. Public medical institutions alone have more than 1,300 medical personnel. Including the more than 2,000 rural health workers trained by various counties, the prefecture has essentially achieved medical institutions or health workers in every township. Sexually transmitted diseases, kala-azar, and leprosy, which once seriously endangered people's health, are gradually being eliminated and controlled. Measles, which was widespread before liberation, has been decreasing year by year. Relapsing fever and smallpox have long since disappeared.

    Before liberation, the healthcare system in the Aba Autonomous Prefecture was extremely backward. The few very rudimentary medical institutions charged exorbitant fees. One injection would cost three stones of highland barley or two yaks. When the working people fell ill, they could only pray to gods and Buddha, and the mortality rate was alarmingly high. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government vigorously increased the number of medical institutions and medical equipment, expanded the ranks of medical personnel, and provided free treatment for people of all ethnic groups. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of last year, medical institutions throughout the prefecture had provided outpatient and mobile treatment to a total of more than 2,910,000 person-times, of which more than 230,000 person-times were free of charge. They also administered diphtheria, cholera, typhoid, and other disease prevention injections to people of all ethnic groups more than 460,000 times. At the same time, the vast numbers of medical personnel also conducted extensive and in-depth health education through exhibitions, broadcasts, slide shows, and other forms, increasing the public's health knowledge. The mass patriotic health movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene has also gradually developed. Currently, in most areas, people of all ethnic groups have begun to develop good habits such as washing their faces and brushing their teeth every day, and bathing and changing clothes regularly.

    Before liberation, the autonomous prefecture had no maternal and child health institutions. Women had no knowledge of maternal and child health. Most births took place in livestock pens. Now, the prefecture has established 11 maternal and child health stations and midwifery stations, and trained more than 1,500 midwives and maternal and child health workers. Prenatal check-ups and modern methods of delivery have been popularized, and the infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced. The saying "Only see the mother conceive, but not the child born" has become a relic of history. Many villages have seen a flourishing population. (Yang Fangfeng) (Attached picture)

    阿坝建立遍布全州的医疗保健网
    疾病减少　人丁兴旺
    本报讯　解放前只有七个简陋医疗机构的阿坝藏族自治州，现在正在建立一个遍布全州的医疗保健网。
    现在，阿坝自治州已建立医疗保健机构二百一十一个，比解放前增加了三十多倍，仅全州公立医疗机构中，就有医务人员一千三百多名。加上各县训练的二千多名农村保健人员，全州已基本上达到乡乡有医疗机构或保健人员。过去严重危害人民健康的性病、黑热病和麻疯病，正被逐渐消灭和控制。解放前广泛流行的麻疹，已逐年减少，回归热和天花，早已先后绝迹。
    解放前，阿坝自治州卫生事业极其落后。仅有的几个非常简陋的医疗机构，收费也很高昂。注射一次针药，就要收青稞三石或牦牛二头。广大劳动人民患病时只有求神拜佛，死亡率达到惊人的程度。解放后，党和人民政府大力增设医疗机构和医疗设备，扩大医务人员队伍，并为各族人民进行免费治疗。据不完全统计，到去年年底为止，全州医疗机构门诊治疗和巡回治疗共达二百九十一万多人次，其中免费治疗有二十三万多人次，并为各族人民进行白喉、霍乱、伤寒等疾病预防注射四十六万多人次。同时，广大医务人员还通过展览会、广播、幻灯等各种形式，广泛深入地进行卫生宣传，增加了群众的卫生知识，除四害、讲卫生的群众性爱国卫生运动，也逐步开展起来。目前，在大部分地区，各族人民已开始养成每天洗脸、刷牙，经常洗澡换衣的良好习惯。
    解放前，自治州没有任何妇幼保健机构，妇女们毫无妇幼卫生知识，生孩子大多在牲畜圈里。现在，全州已建立妇幼保健站、接生站十一个，培养了助产士、妇幼保健员一千五百多名，比较普遍地推广了产前检查和新法接生，婴儿死亡率大大降低。“只见娘怀胎，不见儿下地”的谚语，已经成为历史的陈迹。许多村寨出现了人丁兴旺的景象。　（杨芳丰）（附图片）
