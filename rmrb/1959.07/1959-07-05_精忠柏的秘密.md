    The Secret of the Loyalty Cypress
    It is said that in Yue Fei's tomb in West Lake, there is a type of cypress tree that is black and hard, and makes a metallic sound when struck. Folk legends say that Yue Fei was loyal to his country, so the trees next to his tomb were also moved and became very strong. Therefore, it is called the "Loyalty Cypress."
    In fact, this type of tree exists in many places, such as Shanxi and Hebei. The reason they are so hard is because the soil they are in is rich in silica, which is absorbed by the trees in large quantities. In mineralogy, this type of wood is called "silicified wood" or "wood opal."
    By artificially injecting silica into a tree, the rising sap will carry it to all parts of the tree, which can also make the tree stronger. This method is often used in the forestry industry. The principle is the same as using potassium silicate as a fertilizer in agriculture to prevent crops from lodging.

    精忠柏的秘密
    据说西湖岳飞的墓地有一种柏树，色黑而坚，打击起来会作金石响。民间传说：岳飞精忠报国，所以墓旁的树也被感动，变得非常坚强。因此便称它为“精忠柏”。
    其实，这种树在山西、河北等许多地方都有。它们所以坚硬，是由于所在的土中富于硅质，被树木多量吸收所致。在矿物学上，这种树木叫做
  “硅化木”或“木化蛋白石”。
    用人工把硅质注射到树中，上升的树液便会把它带到树木的各个部分，也可以使树变得坚强。森林工业上就往往采用这种方法。农业上用硅酸钾作肥料，防止作物倒伏，道理也正相同。
