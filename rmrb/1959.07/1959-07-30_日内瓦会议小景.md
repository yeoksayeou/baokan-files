    Glimpses of the Geneva Conference

    The Western Foreign Ministers' Hardships
    The weather isn't cooperating; Europe is experiencing a heat wave this summer. Geneva is no exception. The foreign ministers are suffering, especially the Western foreign ministers: suffering from parrying the solemn accusations of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, suffering from defending their unreasonable positions, and suffering from coordinating internal contradictions.

    They are rushing about, traveling between various capitals and Geneva. In less than two weeks since the resumption of the conference, von Brentano has returned to Bonn twice, de Murville has returned to Paris three times, and Herter and von Brentano have gone to West Berlin together, putting Dulles's name on a street to encourage the West German militarists. Lloyd has traveled back and forth between London and Geneva twice, and in the midst of his busy schedule, he also had to make a trip to Paris to report to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters.

    As for the Western bilateral, trilateral, and quadrilateral strategic talks in Geneva, pre-conference coordination, and post-conference studies, working lunches, and the like, they are too numerous to mention. No wonder Lloyd complained at the meeting: "Exhausted."

    Behind the Scenes of "Unity"
    Von Brentano is often invited to talks only after the Western three countries have discussed countermeasures. Western reporters explain that this is because discussing certain countermeasures in the presence of the West German foreign minister is "inconvenient." De Murville is often dissatisfied with being excluded from the secret consultations between the American and British foreign ministers. Herter's separate visit to Gromyko aroused the suspicion of the British Foreign Secretary. Lloyd's exclusive interview with the Soviet Foreign Minister also aroused Herter's suspicion. Von Brentano sent a bouquet of flowers to Gromyko on his fiftieth birthday, expressing a false congratulation. The French Foreign Minister disapproved. On such matters of etiquette, the West cannot even agree.

    Mutual checks, mutual suspicion, mutual suspicion. This is also the behind-the-scenes trick of "Western unity."

    A New Interpretation of "Disengagement"
    "Disengagement" has recently become a popular topic. People are exploring: how to separate the military forces of the East and West, with the aim of avoiding the possibility of conflict.

    Adenauer also talked a lot about his "disengagement" after the resumption of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. He advocated that the Foreign Ministers' Conference should simply collapse, not discuss the German question and the West Berlin question, but go directly to the summit conference, and not discuss these issues at the summit conference either. The aim is to let these issues "disengage" from the conference and the possibility of solving problems, in order to maintain their threat to peace and security.

    日内瓦会议小景
    西方外长的辛苦
    天公不作美，今夏欧洲盛暑。日内瓦也未例外。外长们苦矣，而西方外长尤苦：苦于招架苏联和德意志民主共和国的严正斥责，苦于辩护自己的无理立场，苦于协调内部矛盾。
    他们仆仆风尘，奔波于各国首都和日内瓦之间。复会不到两周，勃伦塔诺两返波恩，德姆维尔三回巴黎，赫脱和勃伦塔诺同去西柏林，把杜勒斯的名字按在一条街道上，为西德的军国主义分子打气。劳埃德两次往返于伦敦日内瓦道上，在百忙中还不得不抽空去一趟巴黎，向北大西洋集团总部汇报。
    至于在日内瓦西方的双边、三边、四边战略会谈，会前协调，会后研究，工作午宴之类，则更是不胜枚举。难怪劳埃德在会上叫苦：“劳累不堪”。
      “团结”的幕后
    勃伦塔诺时常是在西方三国会谈对策后才被请去交谈，西方记者解释，这是因为当着西德外长的面商谈某些对策“诸多不便”。德姆维尔时常不满被排除在美英两国外长的密商之外。赫脱单独访问葛罗米柯引起英国外交大臣的狐疑。劳埃德专访苏联外长也遭到赫脱的猜忌。勃伦塔诺在葛罗米柯五十寿辰送花一束，表示一下假意的祝贺。法国外长大不以为然。在这种礼节性的问题上，西方的意见竟然也不能一致。
    互相牵制，互相怀疑，互相猜忌。这也是“西方团结”幕后的把戏。
    “脱离接触”新解
    “脱离接触”近来成了脍炙人口的一个问题。人们在探讨：用什么方式使东西方的军事力量隔离开来，目的是避免发生冲突的可能性。
    阿登纳在外长会议复会后也大谈其“脱离接触”。他主张外长会议干脆拉倒，不谈德国问题和西柏林问题，而径直走上首脑会议，而且在首脑会议上也不谈这些问题。目的是要让这些问题同会议，同解决问题的可能性“脱离接触”，以保持它们对和平与安全的威胁。
    谨防假冒！
