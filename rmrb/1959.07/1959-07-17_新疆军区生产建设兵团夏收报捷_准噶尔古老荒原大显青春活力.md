Urumqi Dispatch: The good news of a bumper wheat harvest comes from an ancient wilderness area near the center of the Junggar Basin in northern Xinjiang. These wheat fields total more than 123,500 mu, sown last winter by a production unit of the Manas Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps. Based on the six million mu of ordinary wheat fields that have already been harvested, the wheat is growing very well, with an average yield of about 400 jin per mu. The 2,114 mu of wheat fields already threshed by the Third Farm yielded 895,645 jin of dry wheat, an average yield of 423.6 jin per mu.

Currently, thousands of harvesters are working with more than 20 combine harvesters and more than 40 horse-drawn harvesters, day and night, in tens of thousands of mu of better wheat fields, striving to bring every grain into the granary.

During the Great Leap Forward high tide in 1958, this production unit entered this ancient wilderness area near the center of the basin. Over the past year, they have endured difficulties such as chronic water shortage, summer heat, and winter cold in this dry wilderness covered with saxaul, tamarisk, and purslane, opening canals, building roads, and reclaiming farmland, successively establishing seven modern-scale farms. This year, they have grown more than 300,000 mu of various crops on this virgin land, including more than 123,500 mu of wheat. Since July 1, 27 combine harvesters and 48 horse-drawn harvesters have been put into the wheat harvesting battle, with more than 6,000 sickle-wielding workers cooperating in the rush harvest. The ancient wilderness, which has been silent for thousands of years, is showing a moving scene of a great harvest everywhere.

The good news of the wheat harvest from the heart of Junggar has greatly inspired the production enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The People's Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has formed a special acceptance team to visit, inspect, and accept the harvest.

Urumqi Dispatch: The Communist Youth League Farm, established by the Manas Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps in the center of the Junggar Basin, recently harvested 1,003.4 mu of wheat land in plots No. 6 and No. 10, with an average yield of 744 jin and 3 liang per mu.

These two wheat fields, like other wheat fields of the Communist Youth League Farm, were newly reclaimed from ancient wasteland last year, with fertile soil. Both wastelands were deeply ploughed to 30 cm, and carefully harrowed and leveled, turning the undulating wasteland into neat and flat plots. At the time of sowing, an average of more than 37 jin of seeds were sown per mu, achieving reasonable close planting. Due to the abnormally dry climate and very little water, whether the watering was appropriate and timely became the key issue after wheat sowing. They adopted the method of small furrow irrigation in all watering, so that the amount of water could penetrate evenly. In addition to winter irrigation after wheat seedlings emerged in winter, they generally watered three times this year. A portion of the land with higher alkalinity at the southern end of plot No. 6 was specially watered once more. The first watering generally seeped to 80 cm, and the subsequent two times were around 60 cm, so that all the wheat fields always maintained sufficient moisture. After the wheat turned green, they also applied an average of 1,000 jin of rotted sheep manure and humus-rich soil per mu of wheat field, according to the particularly lush growth of the wheat seedlings.

Currently, more than 17,000 mu of wheat in the entire farm is continuing to be harvested.

### 新疆军区生产建设兵团夏收报捷  准噶尔古老荒原大显青春活力

    新疆军区生产建设兵团夏收报捷
    准噶尔古老荒原大显青春活力
    本报乌鲁木齐16日电　从新疆北部接近准噶尔盆地中心地带的一片古老荒原上，传来小麦丰收喜讯。这片麦田共有十二万三千五百多亩，是新疆军区生产建设兵团玛纳斯垦区一支生产部队去年冬季种下的。根据已经收割的六万来亩一般麦田看来，小麦长得很好，平均每亩产量都在四百斤左右。第三农场已脱粒的二千一百一十四亩麦田，实收干麦八十九万五千六百四十五斤，平均亩产四百二十三点六斤。
  目前，数千麦收大军正配合二十多部康拜因收割机和四十多部马拉收割机，在几万亩较好的麦田里，日夜不息地抢收，力争颗粒归仓。
    在1958年大跃进高潮中，这支生产部队开进了这片接近盆地中心地带的古老荒原。一年以来，他们在遍地长着索索、红柳、枇杷菜的干燥的荒原上，忍受着长年缺水、夏季炎热和冬季严寒等困难，开渠修路，垦殖农田，陆续建立了七个具有现代化规模的农场，今年就使这片处女地长出各种作物三十多万亩，其中有小麦十二万三千五百多亩。从7月1日起，已有二十七台康拜因收割机和四十八台马拉收割机投入麦收战斗，机具两旁有六千多名镰刀手配合抢收。沉寂了千百年的这片古老荒原上，到处显出大丰收的动人景象。
    从准噶尔腹地传来的麦收喜讯，大大激励了新疆各族人民的生产积极性。新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会已组成专门的验收组，前往考察并进行验收。
    本报乌鲁木齐16日电　新疆军区生产建设兵团玛纳斯垦区在准噶尔盆地中央建立的共青团农场，最近收割的六号和十号两块条田一千零三亩四分麦地，平均亩产七百四十四斤三两。
    这两块麦田和共青团农场其他的麦田一样，都是在去年新开垦出来的古老荒地，土质肥沃。这两块荒地都深翻三十公分，并经过细致的耙耱和平整工作，使起伏不平的荒地变成了整齐平坦的条田。播种时，每亩平均下种三十七斤多，作到了合理密植。由于当地气候异常干燥，水量非常缺少，水浇的是否恰当、适时，就成为小麦播种后的关键性问题。他们在浇水中全部采取了小畦灌溉的方法，使水量渗透渗匀，除去冬季小麦出苗后冬灌了一部分外，今年普遍浇了三次水，六号条田南端有一部分碱性较大的土地，还特别多浇了一次水。第一次浇水时普遍渗水达八十公分，以后两次都在六十公分左右，使全部麦田始终保持足够的水分。在小麦返青后，他们根据麦苗长的特别茂盛的情况，还每亩麦田平均追施了一千斤腐熟羊粪和腐质肥土。
    目前全场的一万七千多亩小麦正在继续收割。
