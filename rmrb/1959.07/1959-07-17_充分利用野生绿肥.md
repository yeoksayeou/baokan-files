    Make Full Use of Wild Green Manure
    Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Li Guangrui
    Currently, it is the time when crops need a large amount of fertilizer. The single-season late indica rice in the south needs topdressing; at the same time, after harvesting early rice in mid-to-late July, double-cropping late rice requires a large amount of base fertilizer; and sufficient base fertilizer must also be prepared for autumn-sown crops. Therefore, the summer manure accumulation task is very important and urgent.
    There is a source of fertilizer that is worth focusing on, with wide availability, high fertilizer efficiency, and low cost. This is mountain green manure and lake weeds. Southern farmers have always called this wild green manure the "fertilizer treasure house" of mountainous and lake areas. As the saying goes, "July grass is gold, August grass is silver, September grass is getting old, and October grass is no good." It is now July, and various green grasses are growing vigorously, with tender branches and leaves rich in nutrients. Seizing the opportunity to accumulate a large amount of green manure is of great practical significance for agricultural production.

    Distribution and Types
    In the Yangtze River Basin and southern provinces, due to favorable natural conditions, lush green branches and leaves and fertile wild grasses grow everywhere, whether in remote or near mountains, high slopes or low lakes, pond edges or field ridges. Farmers often collect them as fertilizer. Especially rice fields near mountainous areas, mostly distributed in higher valleys, with inconvenient transportation and difficulties in transporting other organic fertilizers, farmers often cut mountain green manure nearby before transplanting rice seedlings, directly applying it to the fields, with very good fertilizer efficiency. As for areas near lakes, lake weeds and algae are also good sources of fertilizer. Farmers often cut them to soak in the fields, resulting in high fertility and significant increases in rice production.
    Wild green manure is not only widely distributed in various regions, but also comes in many varieties. According to surveys in various regions, there are no less than seventy or eighty kinds. According to preliminary identification, many mountain green manures belong to wild leguminous plants, and their underground parts grow root nodules, which can fix free nitrogen in the air to meet their own nutritional needs, so this wild green manure generally grows particularly green and has particularly high fertilizer efficiency. Some mountain green manures, such as kudzu vines and lespedeza, can not only be used as fertilizer, but also have deep roots, which can achieve good results in maintaining soil and water.

            Fertilizer Efficiency Analysis
    According to scientific analysis, various wild green manures contain rich organic matter and essential nutrients for crops, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other nutrients. For example, someone once cut more than twenty kinds of main mountain green manures in the same period and analyzed them after air-drying. The results showed that the maximum nitrogen content was 2.05%, the minimum was 0.68%; the maximum phosphorus content was 0.58%, the minimum was 0.26%; and the maximum potassium content was 3.83%, the minimum was 0.81%. According to analyses of several commonly used lake weeds such as large-leaf black, small-leaf black, yellow vine grass, and shrimp beard grass in Hunan and other places, the dry matter contained 1.12%-2.67% nitrogen, 0.54%-0.77% phosphorus, and 0.43%-4.07% potassium. Because the nutrients contained in various mountain green manures and aquatic plants are different, experienced old farmers often choose those wild green manures that are the richest in nutrients or have the greatest fertilizer efficiency to use as fertilizer.
    With a little conversion, we can more clearly see how great the fertilizer efficiency of mountain green manure and lake weeds is. According to general nutrient content, the fertilizer efficiency of cutting one thousand catties of wild green manure is approximately equivalent to the nutrients of twenty-five catties of ammonium sulfate, ten catties of superphosphate, and more than ten catties of potassium sulfate, and there is also a lot of organic matter, which is enough for the base fertilizer of one mu of rice field. According to the practical experience of the masses, it also shows that the fertilizer efficiency of various wild green manures is very high. The years of experience of farmers in Yingshan, Hubei, have proven that ten dan of green artemisia are approximately equivalent to twelve dan of human manure and urine, or forty-five dan of cattle manure and urine, or two hundred dan of pond mud. Applying one thousand catties of mountain green manure per mu can increase rice production by 25%-30%. According to data from the Ganjiashan Red Soil Experimental Station in Jiangxi, planting dry crops on red soil wasteland and applying one thousand catties of cultivated wild green manure kudzu vine or lespedeza as green manure, plowing it into the soil surface 30 days before crop planting, can increase wheat production by 16%-39.7% and increase sweet potato production by 39.6%-45.2% (Note: Lespedeza branches are not easily decomposed when applied in dry land, it is best to pile and ferment them before applying them). All this fully shows that the yield-increasing effect of wild green manure is very significant.

          Collection Period and Application Method
    In the southern rice-growing areas, the area of ​​farmland using mountain green manure and wild grass as fertilizer accounts for a considerable proportion. According to a typical survey in Shilihe, Yingshan, Hubei, over the years, the area of ​​rice fields lacking base fertilizer and collecting wild green manure as base fertilizer accounts for about 30% of the transplanting area; the area using green artemisia compost to apply to wheat fields is nearly 20%. In the more than 360,000 mu of rice fields near the Diaochahu Lake in Hanchuan County, the area of ​​lake weed fertilization has been more than 40% over the years. This not only solves the difficulty of insufficient supply of commercial fertilizers, but also saves production investment. At the same time, the fertilizer efficiency of lake weeds is also very high. Applying 2,400 catties of fresh lake weeds per mu (only 800 catties of dry lake weeds) is equivalent to 100 catties of bean cakes or 30 catties of ammonium sulfate, and the fertilizer efficiency is more lasting and not easy to lose than these fertilizers. Each person can collect 600 to 800 catties of wild green manure per day including cutting and transporting, and three or four workdays per mu are enough.
    From the perspective of the period and use of wild green manure cutting in various places, it can be roughly divided into the following types:
    The first type is winter water fields in double-cropping rice and mid-season rice areas. Farmers often collect green manure and soak it in the fields in late spring and early summer (about ten days before transplanting). The amount used per mu is determined according to the quality of the fertilizer. Good green manure is applied about 1,000 catties, and poor quality manure is applied more than 2,000 catties. The method is to plow the field first, scatter the green artemisia into the field, and roll it down with a roller; or chop it into small bundles and step it into the mud with your feet, pour a little shallow water to promote decay. After about ten days, carry out another plowing and harrowing to level the field for transplanting. Fields that have been applied with green manure should always be kept watered and should not be allowed to flow out, reducing the fertilizer efficiency.
    The second type is wheat-mid-season rice and wheat-single-season late indica rice areas. After harvesting wheat, there is a lack of base fertilizer, so green artemisia is cut and soaked in the field in a timely manner, combined with a small amount of lime to promote decay. Since the temperature is already high at this time, the decomposition is fast, and transplanting can be carried out in five or six days. Some people also collect mountain green manure and pile it on the field before harvesting wheat, and apply it to the field immediately after harvesting wheat, which saves time for transplanting.
    The third type is using wild green manure as topdressing for rice.
    The fourth type is to use it as base fertilizer for double-cropping late rice or autumn-sown wheat fields, cutting green artemisia and piling it on the field before the rice is harvested for later use.

    How to preserve the fertilizer efficiency of wild green manure?
    Since general green artemisia is relatively fertile and tender, according to analysis, its own nitrogen content is relatively small, about thirteen to seventeen to one. If green artemisia is not properly treated, nitrogen is easily lost. The main way to preserve fertilizer efficiency is to add a certain amount of crop straw, such as rapeseed stalks, rice straw, wheat straw, etc., to adjust the carbon-nitrogen ratio to greater than or equal to twenty-five to one, and add a small amount of phosphate rock powder or gypsum powder, which can effectively preserve nutrients and reduce loss. The role of adding phosphate rock powder is to well absorb and preserve the nitrogen in the green artemisia, and at the same time, the phosphate rock powder can also improve the fertilizer efficiency after composting and make up for the lack of phosphorus in the green artemisia. This kind of mountain green manure compost should be kept adequately watered. After the initial composting heats up, the outside of the pile should be sealed with mud. In summer, it can be composted to a decomposed or semi-decomposed state in about a month. The composting method is to choose a flat ground close to the raw materials and water, dig a flat-bottomed pit with a diameter of six or seven feet and a depth of one foot, build it tightly, and open cross-shaped ditches in the north-south and east-west directions, each ditch six inches deep and wide. Open wall ditches at both ends of the north-south ditch to the ground. Put the broken soil dug out of the pit around the pit to form a thick embankment six or seven inches high to prevent rain from washing away. Dig a pit with a diameter of two feet and a depth of two feet next to the pit, with a ditch to connect it, so that the excess liquid from watering the compost can be injected into the pit for re-watering onto the pile at any time. As shown in the figure below.
    If you use field ridges, manure pools, or small ponds to soak the mountain green manure and straw together, you can also achieve the purpose of decomposition and fertilizer preservation. When soaking, it is required that the bottom of the pit does not leak water, and cut off water ditches to prevent rain from washing away. After a few days of exposure to the sun, it should still be sealed to allow anaerobic fermentation and decomposition before use.

    As for the treatment method of lake weeds, the experience of farmers in Hanchuan, Hubei, is: to dry the salvaged lake weeds in place until they are semi-dry and become light green (commonly known as duck egg green), and then transport them back to pile them. The grass pile is generally about ten feet wide and fifteen feet high, and covered with rice straw on top to prevent rain. After such treatment, the color will not change and it will not rot or deteriorate even after several months of preservation. When preparing the field, apply sufficient grass fertilizer according to the fertility of the field, and apply 20 to 30 catties of lime to promote the decay of the lake weeds. This way the fertilizer efficiency is also very good.

    充分利用野生绿肥
    中国农业科学院　李光锐
    目前正是庄稼需要大量肥料的时候。南方的一季晚粳稻正需追肥；同时在7月中下旬收割早稻以后，连作晚稻又需大量的底肥；还得为秋播作物准备足够的基肥。因此，夏季积肥任务是十分重要而紧迫的。
    有一种值得大抓特抓的肥源，它的来路较广、肥效较大、成本也很低，这就是山青和湖草。南方农民一向把这种野生绿肥称为山区、湖区的“肥料宝库”。农谚说：“7月草是金，8月草是银，9月草渐老，10月草不好”。目前正是7月天气，各种青藁生长茂盛，枝梢嫩叶富含养分的时候。抓紧突击积存大量青肥，对农业生产具有很大的现实意义。
    分布和种类
    在长江流域和南方各省，由于自然条件较好，不论远山近山、高坡低湖、塘畔田坎，到处都丛生着嫩绿的枝叶和肥美的野草。农民时常采集作为肥料。特别是靠近山区的水稻田，多分布在较高的山谷，交通不便，挑运其他有机质肥料有困难，农民常在插秧前就近打割山青，直接上田，肥效很好。至于靠湖地区，湖草水藻也是一种好肥源，农民多割来沤田，肥气大，水稻增产也很多。
    各地野生绿肥不仅分布广，而且种类很多。根据各地调查，不下七八十种。根据初步鉴定，有许多山青属于野生豆科植物，它们的地下部分生长着根瘤，能固定空气中的游离氮素，供给本身营养之需，所以这种野生绿肥一般都生长得分外嫩绿，肥效特别高。有的山青如葛藤、胡枝子等不仅可以作肥料，而且根系生长很深，还可收到保持水土的良好效果。
            肥效分析
    根据科学分析结果，各种野生绿肥都含有丰富的有机质，具有庄稼所必需的氮、磷、钾及其他营养元素。例如有人曾在同一时期割二十多种主要山青，风干后分析结果，其中氮素含量最多为2.05％，最少为0.68％；磷素最多为0.58％，最少0.26％；钾素最多的3.83％，最少0.81％。又据湖南等地对大叶黑、细叶黑、黄藤草、虾须草等几种常用的湖草分析，干物质含氮量达到1.12％—2.67％，含磷0.54％—0.77％，含钾0.43％—4.07％。由于各种山青、水草所含养分不同，所以有经验的老农打割时，多选择那些最富养分或者肥气大的野生绿肥来作肥料。
    我们只要稍加换算，就可以更明显地看出，山青湖草的肥效有多大了。如果按照一般养分含量来说，打割一千斤野生绿肥的肥效大约可以抵住二十五斤硫酸铵、十斤过磷酸钙和十多斤硫酸钾的养分，并且还有很多的有机质，这足够一亩稻田的底肥。根据群众生产实践经验，也说明各种野生绿肥的肥效是很高的。湖北应山农民多年经验证明：十担青蒿大约可抵十二担人粪尿，或四十五担牛粪尿，或二百担塘泥。每亩施一千斤山青可使水稻增产25％—30％。又据江西甘家山红壤试验站资料，在红壤荒地种植旱作，用经过培育的野生绿肥葛藤或胡枝子一千斤压青，在作物种植前三十天耕入土表下，可使小麦增产16％—39.7％，使甘薯增产39.6％—45.2％（按：胡枝子枝条在旱地施用不易分解，最好先经堆置醱酵以后再行施用）。这都充分说明野生绿肥的增产效果是很显著的。
          采集时期和施用方法
    在南方水稻地区，利用山青野草作肥料的田地占有相当面积。据湖北应山十里河的典型调查，历年来稻田缺底肥采集野生绿肥作底肥的约占栽秧面积30％左右；利用青蒿堆肥上小麦地的面积将近20％。汉川县沿汈汊湖附近三十六万余亩稻田，打湖草肥田的面积历年都在40％以上。这样不独解决了商品肥料供应不足的困难，而且节省了生产投资。同时湖草的肥效也很高，每亩施用二千四百斤新鲜湖草（干湖草只要八百斤），可抵豆饼一百斤，或硫酸铵三十斤，而且比这些肥料的肥效持久，不易流失。每人每天连打带运可采集野生绿肥六百到八百斤，每亩田只要三四个工就够了。
    从各地打割野生绿肥的时期和用途来看，大体上可以分为以下几个类型：
    第一类是双季稻及中稻地区的冬水田，农民多在春末夏初（插秧前十天左右）采集青肥泡田。每亩用量根据质量好坏决定，好青肥施千斤左右，不好的达两千多斤。用法是先将田翻耕起来，将青蒿撒入田中，用碾滚压下；或铡成小把，用脚踩入泥中，灌点浅水，促使腐烂。经十天左右，再进行一次翻耕耖田，把田整平即可插秧。上过青肥的田，要始终保持不断水，也不要使水外流，减低肥效。
    第二类是小麦——中稻，小麦——一季晚粳稻地区，收割小麦后缺少基肥，便及时打割青蒿泡田，结合施小量石灰，促进腐烂，由于这时气温已较高，分解快，经五六天即可插秧。也有的在割麦前，采集山青在田头堆沤，割麦后立即施到田里，这样更能抢时间插秧。
    第三类是利用野生绿肥给水稻作追肥。
    第四类是作二季晚稻或秋播麦田的基肥，在水稻未收割以前，就打割青蒿，在田头堆沤备用。
    怎样保存野生绿肥的肥效？
    由于一般青蒿都比较肥嫩，根据分析，其本身含氮比率较小，约十三到十七比一，对青蒿处理不当，氮素很容易丢失。保存肥效的主要办法是在堆置时加一定数量的作物藁杆，例如油菜杆、稻草、麦草等，将碳氮比例调整到大于或等于二十五比一，同时加入少量磷矿粉或石膏粉，就可以有效地保住养分很少丢失。加入磷矿粉的作用，在于很好地吸收保存青蒿中的氮素，同时磷矿粉经过堆沤还可以提高肥效，弥补青蒿中磷素不足的缺点。这种山青堆肥，应当保持充足的水分。初堆发热以后，即应在堆外涂泥封闭。在夏季约经一月可以堆至腐熟或半腐熟状态。堆制办法是选一接近原料和水的高平地面，挖直径六、七尺，深一尺的平底坑，筑紧，开南北和东西向十字形沟，沟深宽各六寸，在南北向沟的两端各开墙沟通至地面，从坑里挖起的碎土放在坑周围；筑成高六七寸的厚围埂，以免雨水冲洗。坑旁挖一直径二尺、深二尺的坑，有沟相通，使浇淋堆肥的多余液体注入坑中，以便随时再浇到堆上。如下图。
    如果利用田头垱、粪库或小塘，把山青和藁秆一同沤泡时，也可以达到腐熟和保肥的目的。在沤泡时要求坑底不漏水，挖断水沟，不使雨水冲洗。暴晒几天后仍应封闭，使其进行嫌气性发酵，腐熟后启用。
    至于湖草处理办法，湖北汉川农民的经验是：将打捞的湖草就地晒成半干，成淡绿色（群众称为鸭蛋青），然后运回上堆。草堆一般宽一丈左右，高一丈五尺，顶上复盖稻草防雨。如此处理，虽保存数月其色不变，亦不腐烂变质。到整田时，就按田底子肥瘦下足草肥，并兼施石灰二十斤到三十斤，促使湖草腐烂。这样肥效也很好。
