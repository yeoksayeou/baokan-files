Jiangyou Building a Large Cement Plant

One of China's largest cement plants, the Jiangyou Cement Plant in Sichuan, is being accelerated. This cement plant is receiving selfless assistance from experts from the German Democratic Republic during its construction. The entire production process of this plant, from mining to finished product output, is highly mechanized and automated.

This plant will be completed in the third quarter of this year. Once fully operational, it will produce one million tons of mixed cement annually. (Attached picture)

    江油兴建大水泥厂
    我国最大的水泥厂之一——四川江油水泥厂，正在加速建设。这座水泥厂在建设中得到德意志民主共和国专家的无私帮助。这个厂从采矿到成品出厂，全部生产过程都是较高度的机械化和自动化。
    这个厂将在今年三季度建成，全部投入生产后，每年可产混合水泥一百万吨。（附图片）
