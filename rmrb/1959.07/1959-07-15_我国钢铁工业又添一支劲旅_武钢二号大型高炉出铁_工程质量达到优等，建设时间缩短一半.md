Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 14th: Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 blast furnace smoothly produced its first batch of molten iron today.

At 3:53 PM today, the furnace workers skillfully used an electric taphole opener to open the taphole, and molten iron rushed out like a fiery dragon. At this moment, sparks flew around the iron ladle, and applause thundered throughout the site.

The first batch of molten iron took only thirteen minutes from the start of opening the taphole to the outflow of iron. Workers with many years of ironmaking experience said, "I have never seen the first batch of iron come out so quickly. Even the twenty-odd bottles of oxygen prepared for burning the taphole were not used at all."

Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 blast furnace is the same type as No. 1 blast furnace, a world-class large blast furnace.

Some of the auxiliary projects for No. 2 blast furnace, such as water and electricity supply, were completed during the construction of No. 1 blast furnace. However, its workload is still very large. The installation of metal structures and equipment alone amounts to more than 7,000 tons, and the metal pipes surrounding the furnace body are more than ten kilometers long. The technical requirements are also very strict. Such a large blast furnace generally takes eight to ten months to build, while No. 2 blast furnace took only four months and twenty days from the pouring of the hot blast stove foundation on February 18th to the completion of the test run and delivery for production on July 10th. Its project quality was rated as excellent. Among the thirty-nine projects that have been accepted, thirty-three have reached excellent quality, five have good quality, and one has qualified quality. In particular, the engineering quality of the key parts of the blast furnace has exceeded the design standards.

In the construction process of Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 blast furnace, the builders fully utilized the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year and strengthened the cooperation between various types of work. They organized multi-layer three-dimensional parallel operations. After the foundation of the blast furnace was built, the industrial installation workers immediately installed the blast furnace shell, creating conditions for the furnace building and equipment installation workers to work in advance. Due to the simultaneous construction of each process on a vertical plane, when the blast furnace body was nearing completion, many complex installation projects, such as automatic distribution panels and weighing cars, were also completed. Due to the adoption of the above construction methods, according to preliminary statistics, the construction period of fourteen major individual projects was shortened by more than half compared with No. 1 blast furnace, and the quality also exceeded the design requirements.

In the construction process of the blast furnace, the builders tried every means to ensure the quality of the project. Before installing the electrical control panel of the No. 2 blast furnace top hoist, the electrical installation workers took the initiative to go to the No. 1 blast furnace hoist room to solicit the opinions of the production department, and then numbered all the more than 4,000 wire ends connecting twelve kinds of machinery to facilitate the reviewer's review and prevent errors. The leading cadres of the furnace building company also went deep into the construction site to participate in labor and solve problems in a timely manner, so that the 120,000 refractory bricks at the bottom of the blast furnace were all processed and finely ground six times in advance, classified and layered according to height and thickness, and each brick and each seam were inspected, so that the entire bricklaying project at the bottom of the furnace reached excellent quality. When the No. 2 blast furnace project was nearing completion, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Party Committee put forward the slogan of "Strict Inspection, More Inspection, Preparedness", and adopted a method combining special responsibility inspection with mass inspection to conduct a major quality inspection.

    我国钢铁工业又添一支劲旅
    武钢二号大型高炉出铁
    工程质量达到优等，建设时间缩短一半
    新华社武汉14日电　武汉钢铁公司二号高炉今天顺利地流出了第一炉铁水。
    今天下午三点五十三分钟，炉前工熟练地用电动开口机通开出铁口，铁水如同火龙滚滚冲出。这时，铁水罐的四周金星飞溅，全场掌声雷动。
    第一炉铁水，从开始通铁口到出铁，只用了十三分钟。具有多年炼铁经验的工人说：“从没见过第一炉的铁出得这样快，连准备用来烧铁口的二十多瓶氧气，一瓶也没用上。”
    武钢二号高炉是跟一号高炉同类型的，世界第一流的大高炉。
    二号高炉的供水、供电等附属工程，有一部分在建设一号高炉的时候就完成了。但是它的工程量仍然很大，光是金属结构和设备的安装量，就有七千多吨，围绕炉体的金属管道有十多公里长。技术要求也非常严格。这样的大型高炉，一般需要建设八个月到十个月，而二号高炉从2月18日浇灌热风炉基础开始到7月10日试车完毕、交付生产，只用了四个月零二十天。它的工程质量被评为优等。在三十九个已验收的项目中，有三十三项达到质量优等，五项质量良好，一项质量合格。特别是高炉的关键部位，工程质量都超过了设计标准。
    在武钢二号高炉的建设过程中，建设者们充分运用了去年大跃进的经验，加强了各工种之间的协作。他们组织了多层立体平行作业施工，在高炉基础建好之后，工业安装工人紧接着就安装高炉炉壳，为筑炉、设备安装等工人提前工作创造了条件。由于各道工序在一个垂直面上同时进行施工，高炉本体快建成时，许多复杂的安装工程，如自动配电盘、秤量车等也接着安装完毕。由于采取以上施工方法，据初步统计，十四个主要的单项工程的工期，都比一号高炉缩短一半以上，质量也都超过设计要求。
    在高炉的建设过程中，建设者们千方百计地保证工程质量。电气安装工人在安装二号高炉炉顶卷扬机的电器操纵盘以前，主动到一号高炉卷扬机室去征求生产部门的意见，然后把联系着十二种机械的四千多个线头都编上号码，便于校线人作审查，不致出错。筑炉公司的领导干部还深入工地参加劳动，及时解决问题，使高炉炉底的十二万块耐火砖事先都加工细磨了六遍，按照高度和厚度分类配层，并且检查了每块砖，每条缝，使炉底砌砖工程全部达到优等质量。在二号高炉工程快结束的时候，武钢党委又提出了“严查、多查、有备”的口号，采用专责检查同群众检查相结合的办法，进行了质量大检查。（附图片）
