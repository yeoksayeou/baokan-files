Party Organization Activities

    The Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Daqintala People's Commune in Naiman Banner, Jerim League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, recently organized an on-site meeting on organizational work for its subordinate Party grassroots organizations. The purpose was to allow everyone to summarize and learn from the leadership methods and experiences of the Advanced Production Team Party Branch, thereby promoting the work of each branch. The attending branch secretaries and committee members listened to the introduction of the leadership methods and experiences of the Advanced Production Team Party Branch, and everyone mutually inspected their own branch's work and exchanged experiences. Through the exchange of experiences, everyone further learned to apply the working method of "first within the Party, then outside the Party." Many branches further stipulated the meeting system of the branch and groups through the study at the meeting. This meeting also exchanged experiences on strengthening the cultivation and education of activists, and the examination and education of probationary Party members. Since the convening of this meeting, each branch has further exerted the core leadership role of the Party organization in production, powerfully promoting production.

    用现场会议推动支部工作
    中共内蒙古自治区哲里木盟奈曼旗大沁他拉人民公社委员会，最近组织所属党的基层组织召开了组织工作现场会议，让大家总结和学习前进生产队党支部的领导方法和经验，推动了各支部的工作。到会的各支部书记和委员听取了前进生产党支部的领导方法和经验的介绍，大家都互相检查了本支部的工作，交流了经验。通过交流经验，大家进一步学会运用先党内后党外的工作方法。不少支部通过会议学习，进一步规定了支部和小组的会议制度。这次会议上还交流了加强对积极分子的培养教育，和对预备党员考察教育等问题的经验。自从召开这次会议以后，各支部在生产中进一步发挥了党组织的核心领导作用，有力地推动了生产。
