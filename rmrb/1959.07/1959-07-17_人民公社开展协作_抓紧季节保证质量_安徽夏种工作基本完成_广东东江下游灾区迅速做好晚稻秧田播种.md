Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 16th: Anhui Province has basically completed its summer planting. As of July 13, the province has planted more than 49 million mu of crops such as rice, sweet potatoes, soybeans, corn, and sesame, an increase of more than 900,000 mu compared to last year's summer planting area. At present, from the mountainous areas of southern Anhui to the plains of northern Anhui, the summer crops are lush and growing vigorously.

	In the summer planting, all parts of Anhui fully utilized the superiority of the People's Communes and carried out large-scale collaboration, enabling the summer planting tasks to be completed quickly and well. In Huoqiu County, ten communes and seventy-seven production teams, based on the principle of equivalent exchange in the summer planting, cooperated for more than 40,000 workdays and supported each other with seedlings for more than 30,000 mu of land. In the summer planting competition, Guihua and Baizi'an production teams of Fenghuangtai Commune in Liuan County helped each other. Baizi'an team had 195 mu of wheat stubble rice transplanting tasks, while Guihua team had only 110 mu of wheat stubble seedlings. After Guihua team finished transplanting its seedlings, it sent 28 laborers and two oxen to support Baizi'an team in transplanting, enabling Baizi'an team to complete the transplanting of mid-season rice in a timely manner.

	All localities paid attention to seizing the opportunity and ensuring quality during the summer planting. In order to seize the moisture and plant sweet potatoes, the Fuyang Special District mobilized more than 2 million people to carry out a rush planting after the rain, planting 590,000 mu of sweet potatoes in one day. In Binghui County, during the summer planting, the practice of "harvesting, plowing, and planting simultaneously" was generally adopted. More than 10,000 pieces of water lifting tools were used throughout the county to lift water and irrigate the fields in a timely manner, ensuring the progress of planting. The 1.29 million mu of mid-season rice that has been planted in the Wuhu Special District have generally been plowed and harrowed two or three times, with about 500 dan of base fertilizer applied per mu. In order to ensure the quality of sowing, the People's Communes in Xuancheng County also organized more than 100 acceptance groups to go deep into the fields to inspect and accept the land plot by plot, ensuring that the quality of all the more than 1 million mu of upland and lowland crops sown in the county met the requirements.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: Seventy-one People's Communes in the disaster areas of Huiyang, Boluo, Dongguan, and Zengcheng counties in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River in Guangdong have completed the late rice seedling bed sowing task. Now, in the hundreds of thousands of mu of seedling beds on both sides of the Dongjiang River, the seedlings are lush and green. Various localities are strengthening the management of seedling cultivation. Huiyang County, which started sowing earlier, has already transplanted more than 40,000 mu of late rice.

	When the flood began to recede, the masses in this area put forward the slogan of "Plant as soon as the water recedes," seizing the season and actively leveling the seedling beds, soaking seeds, and sowing. In addition to the part of the grain seeds that the people in the disaster area actively salvaged and rescued during the flood, the government quickly transferred nearly 9 million jin of grain seeds, ensuring that the people in several counties had enough seeds to sow.

	At present, Huiyang, Boluo, and Zengcheng counties have organized more than 12,000 people into professional teams dedicated to managing seedling beds and cultivating strong seedlings. The Party committees of various counties have universally organized cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to carry out large-scale inspections and evaluations of seedling beds to promote the management of seedling beds, striving to make all seedlings fertile and strong.

    人民公社开展协作  抓紧季节保证质量
    安徽夏种工作基本完成
    广东东江下游灾区迅速做好晚稻秧田播种
    新华社合肥16日电　安徽省夏种已基本结束。截至7月13日止，全省已种水稻、山芋、黄豆、玉米、芝麻等作物四千九百多万亩，夏播面积比去年增加九十多万亩。目前，从皖南山区到淮北平原，夏种作物一片葱绿，生长旺盛。
    安徽各地在夏种中充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，开展了大协作，使夏播任务完成得又快又好。霍丘县的十个公社、七十七个生产队，在夏播中根据等价交换的原则，互相协作的工作日达四万多个，互相支援了三万多亩地的秧苗。六安县凤凰台公社桂花和百子庵两个生产队，在夏种竞赛中互相帮助，百子庵队麦茬插秧任务有一百九十五亩，桂花队麦茬秧只有一百一十亩。桂花队栽好秧以后，就抽出二十八个劳力和两头耕牛，支援百子庵队栽种，使百子庵队及时完成了中稻的栽秧任务。
    各地在夏种中都注意抓紧时机和保证质量。阜阳专区为了抢墒种山芋，在雨后发动了二百多万人突击抢栽，一天栽山芋五十九万亩。炳辉县在夏种中，普遍做到了“边收、边耕、边种”，全县用一万多件提水工具及时提水灌田，保证了栽种进度。芜湖专区已栽的一百二十九万亩中稻，一般都耕耙两三次，每亩施基肥五百担左右，宣城县各人民公社为保证播种质量，还组织了一百多个验收小组，深入田间，逐丘逐块检查、验收，使全县已播种的一百多万亩水旱作物，质量全部合乎要求。
    据新华社广州16日电　广东东江下游惠阳、博罗、东莞、增城等县受灾地区的七十一个人民公社，已经完成了晚稻秧田播种任务。现在，东江两岸的几十万亩秧田里，秧苗一片青葱。各地正在加强秧苗培育管理工作。播种较早的惠阳县已经插下晚稻四万多亩。
    当洪水开始消退的时候，这一带的群众就提出了“水退一块，赶播一块”的口号，抓紧季节，纷纷平整秧田、浸种、播种。除了灾区人民在洪水期间，积极打捞、抢救出的一部分谷种外，政府迅速地调来了近九百万斤谷种，保证了几个县的人民有足够的种子下田。
    目前，惠阳、博罗、增城三个县已经组织了一万二千多人的专业队，专责管理秧田，培育壮秧。各县党委普遍组织干部、老农、技术员，开展秧田大检查大评比，推动秧田管理工作。争取全部秧苗肥壮。
