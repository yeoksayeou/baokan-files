    Using Appraisals and Inspections to Promote Increased Autumn Grain Production
    Lin County Inspection Teams Deeply Investigate Plains and Mountainous Areas, Promptly Resolve Problems, and Promote Experiences Locally
    Zhengzhou, July 15th (Our Newspaper) – The Lin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province recently launched a mass autumn grain management inspection and appraisal campaign throughout the county. This has prompted the further implementation of various measures to increase production and effectively promoted autumn grain management work.
    This inspection and appraisal was carried out in two stages. The first stage involved mobilizing the masses within the communes to inspect each other; the second stage involved organizing Party secretaries and member representatives from the county, communes, brigades, and production teams at four levels to conduct inspections and appraisals throughout the county. In the three days from July 2nd to 4th, a total of fifteen communes, two hundred and four brigades, three thousand and ninety-two production teams, and eight thousand and seventeen production groups across the county were inspected and appraised. The area of autumn grain fields inspected and appraised accounted for 65% of the total autumn sowing area.
    The characteristics of this mass inspection and appraisal were: large scale, wide scope, and in-depth and meticulous inspection. The county committee inspection and appraisal team not only inspected both sides of easily accessible roads but also delved into remote mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation. Through this inspection, it was found that there were still more than 16,000 mu of millet and corn across the county that had not been thinned, more than 24,000 mu of autumn seedlings that had not been cultivated, and the area affected by pests reached more than 87,000 mu. Approximately 50% of the autumn grain fields throughout the county had been cultivated and top-dressed, and some crops were planted too sparsely.
    Problems discovered during the inspection and appraisal were promptly resolved. For example, the inspection team discovered that weeds were particularly rampant in the autumn grain fields of six production teams in the Yao Village Commune. They immediately urged commune cadres to extract nearly a thousand male and female laborers from more than a dozen surrounding production teams to carry out a concentrated weeding campaign based on the principle of equal value exchange. In the Hengshui Commune, the Hengshui Brigade only invested 60% of its total labor force in agriculture. As a result, more than 400 mu of autumn seedlings had not yet been hoed even once. The inspection and appraisal team helped this brigade adjust the labor ratio, extracting two hundred and thirty laborers from kindergartens, canteens, and livestock feeders to strengthen autumn grain field management. Cadres of the Kangjie Production Team of the Xiaodian Commune originally thought that their autumn grain management was already quite good. However, during this inspection and appraisal, they discovered that forty of the team’s eighty mu of corn had too few plants, with only eight hundred to one thousand five hundred plants per mu. This would result in a loss of at least more than eleven thousand jin of grain. The entire team immediately worked out four remedial measures: 1. Leave double seedlings where they have not been thinned; 2. Transplant seedlings to fill in gaps where thinning has already occurred; 3. Vigorously apply top dressing to promote large ears and plump grains; 4. Supplement by planting mung beans and vegetables in areas with many missing seedlings.
    The inspection and appraisal team also widely summarized and exchanged experiences in autumn grain management. According to statistics, a total of one thousand and eighty-two battlefield meetings and on-site meetings were held in conjunction with the inspection and appraisal, with the participation of a total of more than seventy-nine thousand cadres and masses. Many advanced experiences in autumn grain management were quickly promoted. For example, the sweet potato cultivation tool of the Songjiazhuang Production Team of the Chengguan Commune could increase labor efficiency twelvefold. After the inspection team discovered this, it organized carpenters from surrounding teams to copy it on the spot. One hundred and seventy-seven were made in seven days, allowing each team's more than 30,000 mu of sweet potatoes to be hoed quickly, saving a total of more than 24,900 workdays. The inspection and appraisal team summarized the experience of autumn grain management in the Heshun Commune: 1. The leadership is determined and grasps every link tightly; 2. Labor quotas were implemented, and a responsibility system for land plots was generally established; 3. Cadres improved their work style and achieved "five samenesses" with the masses, namely, the same labor, the same work points, the same life, the same consultation on decisions, and the same study; 4. The lives of commune members were well arranged, and the production enthusiasm of the masses was high; 5. The entire commune, teams, groups, and individuals launched a labor competition to learn from and catch up with the advanced. Many commune, brigade, and production team Party secretaries who participated in the inspection and appraisal called home overnight to promote the experience of the Heshun Commune.
    Through the inspection and appraisal, a wave of competition to strive for the upper reaches and strive to be advanced in autumn grain management has been set off throughout the county. At present, according to incomplete statistics, eight communes, one hundred and six brigades, two thousand one hundred and forty-two production teams, and more than six thousand production groups are engaged in mutual competition. The competition between individuals within the commune members is even more widespread. At present, the number of laborers attending work throughout the county has increased from more than 160,000 in the past to 190,000. In order to make this mass competition movement sustainable, the county party committee has decided to conduct a second mass inspection and appraisal throughout the county in early August, and has specifically stipulated the content of the inspection and appraisal, calling on party organizations at all levels to earnestly strengthen leadership over this competition movement to ensure a bumper autumn harvest.

### 用评比检查　促秋田增产  林县检查团深入平原山区，及时解决问题，就地推广经验

    用评比检查　促秋田增产
    林县检查团深入平原山区，及时解决问题，就地推广经验
    本报郑州15日电　中共河南省林县县委最近在全县展开了一次群众性的秋田管理检查评比运动，促使各项增产措施更加落实，有力地推动了秋田管理工作。
    这次检查评比是分两段进行的。第一段是在公社内部发动群众互相检查；第二段是组织县、公社、大队和生产队的四级党委书记和社员代表，在全县范围内开展检查评比。在7月2日到4日三天内，共检查评比了全县的十五个公社、二百零四个大队、三千零九十二个生产队、八千零一十七个生产组。检查评比秋田面积占秋播总面积的65％。
    这次群众性检查评比的特点是：规模大，范围广，检查深入细致。县委检查评比团不但检查了交通方便的大路两旁，还特别深入到了交通不便的偏辟山区。通过这次检查，发现全县还有一万六千多亩谷子、玉米没有定苗，二万四千多亩秋苗没有中耕，虫害面积达八万七千多亩，全县大约有50％左右的秋田中耕追肥，部分作物种植过稀。
    在检查评比当中，发现的问题都及时解决了。如检查团在姚村公社发现六个生产队的秋田杂草特别多，便立即督促公社干部按照等价交换原则，从周围的十多个生产队抽出近千个男女劳力实行大协作，突击锄草。横水公社的横水大队投入农业的劳力只占总劳力的60％，因此有四百多亩秋苗还没有锄头遍。检查评比团帮助这个大队调整了劳力比例，从幼儿园、食堂中以及饲养员中抽出二百三十多劳力，加强了秋田管理。小店公社康街生产队的干部原来以为自己的秋田管理得已经不错了。在这次检查评比中，才发现全队的八十亩玉茭中有四十亩株数过少，每亩只有八百株到一千五百株，至少要少收一万一千多斤粮食。全队立即研究出四项补救措施：一、没定苗的要留双株；二、定了苗的要移苗补栽；三、大抓追肥，促使结大穗，催饱粒；四、在缺苗多的地方补种绿豆和菜蔬。
    检查评比团还广泛总结和交流了秋田管理的经验。据统计全县结合检查评比、开战地会、现场会一千零八十二次，参加的干部和群众共七万九千多人，秋田管理方面的许多先进经验都迅速得到推广。例如城关公社宋家庄生产队的红薯中耕器，能够提高劳动效率十二倍。检查团发现后，便组织了周围各队的木匠就地仿制，七天内制成一百七十七张，使各队的三万多亩红薯很快锄了一遍，共节约劳动日二万四千九百多个。检查评比团在河顺公社总结了秋田管理的经验：一、是领导决心大，环环抓得紧；二、实行了劳动定额，普遍建立了地块责任制；三、干部改进作风，和群众作到了“五同”，即同劳动、同记工、同生活、同商量决定问题、同学习；四、社员生活安排好，群众生产情绪高；五、全社队与队、组与组、人与人开展了学先进、赶先进的劳动竞赛。参加检查评比的许多公社、大队、生产队的党委书记，都连夜向家打电话，推广河顺公社的经验。
    通过检查评比，全县掀起了争上游，争先进的秋田管理的竞赛热潮。目前，据不完全统计，互相开展竞赛的有八个公社，一百零六个大队，二千一百四十二个生产队，六千多个生产组。在社员中的人与人竞赛更加广泛。目前全县劳动出勤人数已经从过去的十六万多人增加到十九万人。为使这一群众性的竞赛运动能够持久，县委已决定在8月初在全县进行第二次群众性的检查评比，并且具体规定了检查评比的内容，号召各级党组织要认真加强对这一竞赛运动的领导，确保秋季大丰收。（附图片）
