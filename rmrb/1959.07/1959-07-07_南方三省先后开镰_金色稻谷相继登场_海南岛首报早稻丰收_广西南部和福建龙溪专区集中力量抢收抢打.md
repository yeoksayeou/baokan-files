Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th -- News of the first rice harvest of the year came from Hainan Island. Most of the island's 1.6 million mu of early rice has been harvested and is being threshed intensively. According to the initial threshing situation in various places, the yield per mu of early rice across the island has generally increased again compared to last year, with a general increase of more than 10%.

Qionghai and Yaxian counties on the eastern and southeastern coasts of the island began harvesting early rice as early as late May, followed by Ledong, Dongfang on the southern and western coasts, and Qiongzhong in the central part of the island. By the end of June, Wenchang, Haikou, Danxian, Chengmai, and Dingchang counties and cities in the northern and northwestern coasts had all entered the busy harvest season.

From the start of the early rice harvest to the first half of July, it is the busiest season for Hainan Island, when harvesting early rice, transplanting late rice, and field management of miscellaneous grain crops are squeezed together. Now, all counties, cities, and people's communes are concentrating their efforts on organizing large-scale teams to rush harvest and plant. Some have also organized specialized teams for threshing and field management. In addition, counties and cities have mobilized tens of thousands of cadres, workers, and teachers and students to support the countryside.

Hainan Island's early rice is vulnerable to typhoon damage, and the western coast is prone to drought due to high temperatures and little rain. Coupled with extensive cultivation, the yield is very unstable. In the past, the general yield per mu was around 200 jin, with a few reaching 200 to 300 jin. Many areas in Dongfang County only produced over 100 jin. Last year, the early rice yield in Hainan Island generally did not increase much, only a few agricultural cooperatives on the southeastern coast had higher yields at that time. This year, early rice production in all counties and cities on the island has increased compared to last year, with the most significant increase in low-yield areas. The general yield per mu of early rice in the mountainous areas of Dongfang County this year has increased by about 100% compared to the past. In the coastal sandy areas of this county, farmers used wind power to draw water for irrigation this year, which also doubled the yield. The yield per mu of early rice in the hinterland of the Wuzhi Mountains in Qiongzhong County has always been over 100 jin, but this year it is generally above 250 jin. One hundred mu of early rice in Yacheng Commune in Yaxian County, which has a high yield, has been threshed, with an average yield of 980 jin per mu.

This year, the early rice harvesting work in Hainan Island is generally more meticulous than in the past. Baoting Commune in Yaxian County has taken some measures to prevent scattering in the processes of harvesting, threshing, and transportation, and the harvest is very clean. It is estimated that this way, more than ten to twenty jin of rice can be harvested per mu. In many communes in Qionghai County, commune members carry a small cloth bag with them to pick up fallen grains during harvesting and threshing. Children are also organized to follow the harvesting team to pick up fallen grains. Communes generally have some regulations for careful harvesting.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 6th -- Early rice in Guangxi is ripening one after another, and harvesting has begun in various parts of the south. In the Yulin Special District, where the season is earlier, more than 730,000 people are participating in the rush harvest every day.

Before the harvest began, various places arranged labor, inspected and prepared harvesting tools, and prepared threshing grounds and warehouses. Thirteen counties, including Yongning, Chongzuo, and Fusui, also trained grain keepers for the large teams, preparing for the proper management of early rice. Once the summer harvest season arrived, various places concentrated their main efforts on a blitz harvest. The people's communes in Bobai County transferred 12,000 people from the industrial, sideline, and logistics departments to participate in the rush harvest. Ningming County universally established summer harvest and planting headquarters from the county to the commune and large team levels. Four county party secretaries and eighteen committee members led the summer harvest and planting in different areas. The CPC Yulin Prefectural Committee organized many work groups totaling 10,000 people to go deep into the communes and large teams to fight alongside the commune members. The massive army of various departments supporting the summer harvest also set out one after another.

In May and June, Guangxi experienced continuous rainfall, with rainfall exceeding the average rainfall for the same period in previous years. After the heavy rain, mountain floods broke out, and river water levels rose, causing some early rice to be flooded and reduced or completely lost. Recently, some areas have continued to experience overcast and rainy weather. To avoid and reduce rain damage, various places have reasonably divided labor according to each link in the harvesting process and rushed to harvest in an orderly manner. The Zhuzitang Production Team of Shanxin Commune in Yulin County divided its labor force into specialized groups for cutting rice, threshing, drying, winnowing, weighing, and statistical entry into the warehouse, linking each link tightly to achieve fast harvesting, fast threshing, fast transportation, fast drying, and fast entry into the warehouse. Ningming County's communes organized specialized harvesting, plowing, and transplanting teams. They harvested and planted simultaneously, progressing rapidly. Of the 11,568 mu of early rice fields harvested throughout the county, 7,151 mu have been transplanted with late rice.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 6th -- The busy season for early rice harvesting in the Longxi Special District in southern Fujian Province has arrived. On the golden rice fields, hundreds of thousands of summer harvesting troops are intensively wielding their sickles to rush the harvest.

In order to harvest and thresh the early rice well, the people's communes and production teams in various counties and cities have put forward the slogan of "harvesting one field when it ripens, harvesting one area when it ripens, ensuring high yield and bumper harvest," and timely organized summer harvesting teams to rush the harvest. The secretary of the CPC Changtai County Committee and other leading cadres went down to the fields to rush the harvest with the commune members, leading the commune members to timely harvest the first batch of ripe early rice. Longxi County, which suffered severe rainstorms and the rice was heavily lodged, organized a rush harvest team of more than 50,000 people to rush harvest the lodged rice in the water, greatly reducing losses such as rice germination. All agencies and local troops in the entire special district also dispatched a large number of people to help farmers harvest.

Various places have also promoted many advanced harvesting methods during the summer harvest to ensure careful harvesting and returning all grains to the home. In order to solve the problem of japonica rice being difficult to thresh, many places have concentrated threshing machines to thresh japonica rice, organizing manpower to thresh in shifts day and night, so that people stop but machines do not stop, which saves a lot of rice threshing labor and overcomes the difficulty of insufficient threshing machines. For indica rice, which is prone to grain shedding, various places have also widely promoted the effective methods of cutting with the wind and light placement with heavy threshing, striving to return all grains to the home.

    南方三省先后开镰  金色稻谷相继登场
    海南岛首报早稻丰收
    广西南部和福建龙溪专区集中力量抢收抢打
    新华社广州6日电　从海南岛传来了今年全国第一个水稻丰收的消息。全岛一百六十万亩早稻已经大部收割完毕，正在紧张脱粒。就各地初步脱粒情况来看，全岛早稻亩产量普遍比去年又有提高，一般增产一成以上。
    岛的东部和东南沿岸的琼海和崖县，早在5月下旬就开镰收割早稻，接着南部和西部沿海的乐东、东方和中部的琼中等县也依次开镰收割，到6月底，北部和西北沿海的文昌、海口、儋县、澄迈和定昌等县市就都进入了收割大忙。
    从早稻开镰到7月上半月，是海南岛收打早稻、插种晚稻和杂粮作物田间管理挤在一起的最忙的季节。现在，各县市、各人民公社都集中力量组织大规模抢收抢种队伍，有的还另外组织脱粒和田间管理的专业队。此外，各县市都动员数以万计的干部、职工和学校师生支援农村。
    海南岛早稻易受台风侵袭，西部海岸高温少雨，易受干旱威胁；加上耕作粗放，产量很不稳定。过去一般亩产量是两百斤左右，少数可到两百多斤到三百斤。东方县许多地区只有一百多斤。去年海南岛早稻产量一般提高不多，只东南海岸个别当时的农业社产量较高。今年全岛各县市早稻都比去年增产，而以低产区增产得最显著。东方县山区今年一般早稻亩产量比过去增产一倍左右。这个县沿海风沙区，今年农民利用风力引水灌田，也把产量提高了一倍。琼中县五指山腹地的早稻亩产量一向也是一百多斤，今年一般都在二百五十斤以上。产量较高的崖县崖城公社有一片一百多亩早稻已经脱粒完毕，平均亩产量达到九百八十斤。
    今年，海南岛的早稻收打工作一般比过去作得精细。崖县保亭公社在收割、脱粒、运输各个过程都采取了一些防止抛撒的措施，收打得很干净。这样作，据估计每亩可以多收十几到二十斤稻谷。琼海县许多公社在收打中间，社员们都随身携带有一个拣拾落穗的小布袋，另外还组织儿童跟在收割小组后面专拾落穗。各地公社一般都订有一些细收细打的规定。
    新华社南宁6日电　广西早稻相继黄熟，南部各地开镰收割。季节较早的玉林专区目前每天有七十三万多人，参加抢收。
    开镰以前，各地都安排了劳力，检查和准备了收打工具，备妥了打谷场和仓房。邕宁、崇左、扶绥等十三个县，还训练了大队粮食保管员，为管好早稻作了准备。夏收季节一到，各地就集中主要力量突击收割。博白县各人民公社从工业、副业和后勤部门中抽调了一万二千人参加抢收。宁明县从县到公社、大队普遍建立了夏收夏种指挥部。四个县委书记和十八个委员，分片领导夏收夏种。中共玉林地委组织了共有万人的许多工作团，分别深入公社、大队，同社员们一起战斗。各地各部门支援夏收的大军，也纷纷出动。
    5、6两月，广西连续降雨，降雨量比历年同期平均雨量都多。暴雨之后，山洪暴发，江河水位上涨，一部分早稻被淹减产或完全失收。近来部分地区仍然阴雨持续，为了避免和减轻雨害，各地都按照收割过程的各个环节，合理分工，有秩序地突击抢收。玉林县山心公社竹子塘生产队，把劳动力划分为割禾、打谷、晒谷、风谷、过秤、统计入仓等专业组，环环扣紧，做到了快收、快打、快运、快晒、快入仓。宁明县各公社组织了收割、犁耙、插秧专业组，边收边种，进度很快，全县割完的一万一千五百六十八亩早稻田，已有七千一百五十一亩插上了晚稻。
    新华社福州6日电　福建省南部龙溪专区早稻收获大忙季节已经到来，在稻浪泛金的田野上，数十万夏收大军正在紧张地挥镰抢收。
    为了把早稻收好打好，各县市人民公社和生产队都提出了
  “熟一丘割一丘，熟一片割一片，保证丰产丰收”的口号，及时组织夏收队伍抢收。长泰县中共县委书记等领导干部纷纷下田，同社员一道抢收，带领社员及时地把第一批成熟的早稻割完。遭受暴雨袭击、稻禾倒伏比较严重的龙溪县，组织了一支五万多人的抢收队伍，抢割倒在水里的早稻，大大减少了稻谷出芽等损失。全专区各机关和当地驻军，也抽出了大批人力帮助农民收割。
    各地在夏收中还推广了许多先进的收割方法，以保证细收细打颗粒还家。许多地方为了解决粳稻不易脱粒的问题，都把打谷机集中用来打粳稻，组织人力日夜轮流脱粒，做到人停机不停，既节省了大量打稻劳力，又克服了打谷机不足的困难。对于容易掉粒的籼稻，各地也普遍推广了过去行之有效的顺风割、轻放重打等办法，力争颗粒还家。（附图片）
