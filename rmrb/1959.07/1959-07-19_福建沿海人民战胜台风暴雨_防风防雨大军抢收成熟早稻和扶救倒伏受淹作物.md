Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 18th: After more than two days of effort, hundreds of thousands of people in the coastal areas of Fujian Province have conquered the invasion of typhoons and rainstorms. This is the third victory Fujian Province has achieved in the struggle against strong winds and rainstorms since mid-June.

From the night of the 15th to the night of the 17th, the coastal areas of Fujian Province were successively attacked by winds of force four to eleven and rainstorms of twenty to one hundred and several tens of millimeters. Among them, the coastal area of ​​the Fu'an Special District, which was close to the typhoon's landfall area, had winds of force seven to ten, with a maximum of force eleven, around 11:00 on the 16th. The Zhangpu, Zhangzhou, Haicheng, Tong'an and other areas, which were more affected by tropical air currents, had continuous rainfall of about 100 millimeters in the afternoon of the 17th. Because the party, government, army and people in the coastal areas strengthened wind and rain prevention work before the arrival of the wind and rain, and vigorously carried out emergency harvesting and rescue work when the wind and rain struck, the province only suffered from winds of force seven to eleven and rainstorms of thirty to more than sixty millimeters in Fu'an Special District, where more than 300 houses and pig and cattle pens were blown down and collapsed, and more than 44,000 mu of early, mid, and late rice and other crops were lodged and flooded (of which more than 15,000 mu of crops were flooded). The losses in other areas were very slight.

Now, as the weather clears, the 200,000 to 300,000-strong wind and rain prevention and response army participating in emergency harvesting and rescue in various places has successively turned to rushing to harvest ripe early rice and supporting lodged and flooded crops.

    福建沿海人民战胜台风暴雨
    防风防雨大军抢收成熟早稻和扶救倒伏受淹作物
    新华社福州18日电　福建沿海地区数十万人民经过两天多时间的努力，已经战胜了台风和暴雨的侵袭。这是福建省从6月中旬以来和大风暴雨斗争取得的第三次胜利。
    从15日夜晚开始到17日夜晚止的两天中，福建省沿海地区先后受到四级到十一级的大风和二、三十毫米到一百多毫米的暴雨袭击。其中接近台风中心登陆地区的福安专区沿海，在16日十一点前后，风力达七级到十级，最大达十一级；受到热带气流影响较大的漳浦、漳州、海澄、同安等地区在17日午后曾连续下雨达一百毫米左右。由于沿海地区的党政军民在狂风暴雨到来前加强了防风防雨工作，风雨袭来时又大力抢收抢险，因此，全省除受到七级到十一级和三十到六十多毫米暴雨袭击的福安专区，被狂风暴雨刮倒和冲塌民房、猪牛栏三百多间，四万四千多亩早、中、晚稻等农作物倒伏、被淹外（其中受淹作物一万五千多亩），其他地区损失都很轻微。
    现在随着气候转晴，各地参加抢收抢险的二、三十万防风防雨大军都已陆续转入抢收成熟早稻、扶救倒伏和受淹作物。
