If the trial of Glezos is regarded as a farce, then the superb acting of several roles should indeed be evaluated.

The first is the president of the Greek military tribunal, which is the role with the most scenes. He is somewhat similar to the big painted face of the local bully often played in our Chinese operas. He is rude, sinister, cunning, and likes to use his power to oppress others. He howls loudly and slams the gavel repeatedly, always thinking that in this way, others can be forced to confess. This type of role also has a characteristic of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside. When he encounters heroes who question him with reason, he becomes speechless and stammering. Then he becomes angry and then begins to act shamelessly. The president of the Greek military tribunal is very skilled in using this point. This method, used in the "democratic" trial in Greece, is to interrupt the defendant's lawyer. This method is always used when the dramatic conflict is so acute that it cannot be resolved. The president of this military tribunal uses this method almost every scene, which shows how thrilling the dramatic conflict of this play has reached. For example, in the scene on the morning of the 13th, when the defendant's lawyer revealed that the plaintiff's testimony was illegally fabricated and used examples to prove that Glezos was innocent, the president of the military tribunal had nothing to say. The dramatic conflict had developed to such a point that if he didn't find a way to resolve it, the play itself would fall apart. Therefore, the president of the military tribunal rudely interrupted the defendant's lawyer, saying that he wanted to "prohibit defending the Greek Communist Party." In fact, what does this have to do with the Greek Communist Party! For example, in the scene on the morning of the 14th, the defendant's lawyer used facts to prove that Glezos did not have the ability to be in two places at once. He could not have been in the town of Rafina and at the same time on German Street. Therefore, the lawyer asked: Glezos was in the town of Rafina at the time, how could he have run to the house on German Street to meet with the "spy"? The president had nothing to say, so he interrupted the defendant's lawyer again.

This kind of "interruption" was originally a unique skill from Hitler-style to American-style "democratic" trials. The president of the Greek military tribunal being able to use it so skillfully indeed proves that he has a very deep understanding of Western "democracy."

Another important actor is police officer Papaspiropoulos, who plays the role of the plaintiff's witness in the "democratic" trial. The characteristic of this role is that he is both cunning and honest, both having all kinds of dark cleverness and being extremely stupid. This police officer has portrayed this role to an admirable degree. For example, he played tricks and racked his brains to fabricate false testimonies accusing Glezos, thinking it was seamless, but when he arrived in court, after being questioned by the defendant's lawyer, loopholes appeared everywhere, revealing that every piece was false. How ridiculous this is. When the defendant's lawyer pointed out that he had no specific proof of the defendant's espionage activities, this extremely cunning plaintiff witness actually honestly replied:
"Yes, there is no such proof." Immediately, the whole audience burst into laughter. So much so that the president had to order him not to answer any more questions; in the next trial, he did not dare to ask him to speak again, and simply illegally read out the plaintiff's witness's written testimony. Please see, the plaintiff's witness is neither dead nor a three-year-old child who cannot speak. Isn't the president's actions absurd and a great joke?

A Greek authority figure played a very distinctive role. This role seems to be in the play and also seems to be outside the play, his performance seems to be on the stage and also seems to be under the stage. For example, at the beginning of the play, he came out to speak: he announced that the Glezos case was "a spy case that undermines national security" and that the demands of the people of various countries for the release of Glezos were "an interference in the authority (of the Greek government)." Then, he disappeared behind the scenes; just as the farce was being staged so lively that it was unbearable, he suddenly came out again, announcing: he was going to remove the deputy minister of public order and security from his post, because this deputy minister "was only desperately building the accusation on conjecture, suspicion, and speculation…; and did not provide any material that could be used as the basis for accusing him of espionage." This really added fuel to the fire, making the faces of this small group of people uglier and uglier. This method of being sometimes hidden and sometimes visible, sometimes inside and sometimes outside, has the wonderful effect of a dragon revealing its tail without showing its head.

Finally, we should not omit the prosecutor. This role does not have many lines, but it is very important. Every time he appears, sitting next to the president of the court, he seems to have not much to do, but just as the president is raging, he slowly inserts a sentence: "Calm down a bit", which makes the play much more flavorful.

The theme of framing peace fighters and attacking progressive forces under the guise of "democratic" trials to carry out war and dictatorial conspiracies is not new in the "Western" drama of the twentieth century. Through these ugly exposures, one cannot help but feel anger from the heart, and stand up more to fight against those who create these evils. This is probably the effect that the big bosses of the US State Department, who are the playwrights and directors, did not expect.

    希腊军事法庭上的几个角色
    董逢亚
    如果把对格列索斯的审讯看作是一出丑剧，那么，有几个角色的精湛演技，实在应该评介一下。
    第一个是希腊军事法庭庭长，这是戏最多的一个角色。他有些类似我们中国戏里经常扮演恶霸豪强的那种大花脸。他粗暴、阴险、狡黠，喜欢以势压人。哇呀呀地大声怪叫，惊堂木连连拍得山响，总以为这样，别人就可以被屈打成招。这种角色还有一个特点，就是外强中干。当一遇到英雄豪杰，以理同他质对的时候，他便理屈辞穷，张口结舌，然后便要恼羞成怒，再接着便耍无赖。希腊军事法庭庭长，对这一点运用得非常娴熟。这种手法，运用在希腊的“民主”审讯里，就是打断被告辩护人的发言。这种手法总是当戏剧矛盾尖锐到无法圆场的时候才使用的。这位军事法庭庭长，却几乎场场都用这种手法，可见这出戏的戏剧性冲突达到了怎样使人惊心动魄的地步。例如，在13日上午审讯的那一幕里，当被告辩护人揭露了原告证词是非法捏造的，并用实例证明格列索斯无罪的时候，军事法庭庭长已经无话可说了，戏剧的矛盾已经发展到了这种地步：如果再不想办法圆场，戏本身也要决撒了。于是，军事法庭庭长便粗暴地打断被告辩护人的话，说是他要“禁止替希腊共产党辩护”。其实，这同希腊共产党有什么相干！又如，在14日上午审讯的那一幕中，被告辩护人用事实证明：格列索斯并不会分身法，他不可能既在腊菲纳镇又同时在日尔曼街。因此，辩护人问：格列索斯当时是在腊菲纳镇的，他怎能又同时跑到日尔曼街的房子里去同“间谍”会面呢？庭长无话可说了，便又打断被告辩护人的发言。
    这种“打断”，原是从希特勒式到美国式的“民主”审讯里的一种绝技，希腊军事法庭庭长能够运用得这般到家，的确证明他有极深的西方“民主”的修养。
    另一个重要演员是警官帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯，他在“民主”审讯里扮演原告证人的角色。这个角色的特点是既狡猾又诚实，既有着多般阴暗的鬼聪明又非常的愚蠢，这位警官把这一角色刻划到了令人倾倒的程度。例如他耍弄阴谋，挖空心思地捏造了对格列索斯控告的假证词，自以为是天衣无缝了，但到了法庭上，经被告辩护人一质询便漏洞百出，显出了件件都是假的来。这是多么的可笑。当被告辩护人指明他没有一点关于被告进行间谍活动的具体证明的时候，这个狡猾无比的原告证人，竟然老实地回答：
  “对，没有这些证明。”立即引起了全场人哄堂大笑。以致庭长不得不命令他不要再回答问题；下一次的审讯中竟然不敢再要他出来说话，而干脆违法宣读起原告证人的书面证词来了。请看，原告证人既不曾死，又不是不会说话的三岁孩提，庭长这样作法岂不荒唐和滑天下之大稽吗？
    希腊一位当权人物扮演了一个非常有特色的角色。这个角色好像在戏内，又好像在戏外，他的演出好像在舞台上，又好像是在舞台下。比如戏一开场，他就出台说话了：他宣布格列索斯案件是“一个破坏国家安全的间谍案件”各国人民要求释放格列索斯是“对（希腊政府）职权的干涉”。然后，他就隐没到幕后去了；正当丑剧演到热闹得不可开交的时候，他突然又出台了，宣布：他要撤公共秩序和治安副大臣的职，因为这位副大臣，“只是拚命把控告建筑在猜想、怀疑、推测上……；而没有提出任何材料可以做为控告犯间谍罪的根据。”这真是起到了火上加油的作用，使这一小撮人的面目丑上加丑了。这种时隐时显，时而其中时而其外的手法，颇有神龙露尾不露头的妙处。
    最后，还应该不漏掉检察官。这个角色台词不多，但很重要。他每次出场，在法庭庭长旁边一坐，看起来没有多少戏，但正当庭长暴跳如雷的时候，他却不紧不慢地插了一句：“冷静一些”，这一来可就使戏味浓厚了不知多少倍。
    假借“民主”审讯，陷害和平战士，打击进步力量，以遂战争和独裁阴谋的主题，在二十世纪的“西方”戏剧里，已经是不新鲜的了。通过这些丑恶的暴露，不由得便使人怒从心上起，而更加挺身起来同那些罪恶的制造者们搏斗了。这大概是剧作家兼导演的美国国务院的大老板们所没有意料到的收效吧。
