TISCO Affirms Correct Practices, Restores What Should Be Restored, Supplements the Incomplete, and Resolutely Eliminates the Unsuitable

Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on July 19th: The factories affiliated with Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, in the process of revising their technical operating procedures, have combined the summarization of mass production practices with the improvement of technical management, resulting in a new atmosphere of well-organized production and significantly improved product quality.

Technical operating procedures are the basis for the daily and hourly production activities of the broad masses. Starting in early June, the factory focused on revising operating procedures, supplemented by revising safety procedures and equipment use and maintenance procedures, to strengthen technical management. The approach taken was to spend two weeks, through extensive airing of views, big-character posters, exhibitions, and symposiums, to conduct a major uncovering and exposure of quality problems. More than 27,000 quality-related problems were revealed, forming a mass self-education movement. Then, the leadership, workers, and technicians, through analyzing the quality problems, inspected technical management, identified shortcomings, and dealt with them separately. What was correctly discarded in the past was affirmed; for the lax technical rules and regulations, what should be restored was restored, and what should not be restored was explicitly abolished; for what is currently being implemented, what is correct was resolutely implemented, what is incomplete was supplemented, and what is wrong was eliminated. In addition, for major technical issues, operating procedures, and technical management systems where opinions differed, the factories collectively identified 240 issues, and leading cadres, technicians, and veteran workers engaged in extensive technical debates. If opinions still could not be unified after the debate, technicians and workers combined to conduct experiments. After the experiments reached a conclusion, technicians and veteran workers formulated operating procedures, which were then discussed by the masses and implemented. This mass line approach ensured that the revision of technical regulations fully absorbed the practical experience of the masses and was closely integrated with scientific theory. After the open-hearth furnace in the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant was converted to three-taphole tapping, two opinions emerged regarding the charging amount: one advocated more charging, and the other advocated less charging. After a major debate, opinions remained divided. Later, after several experiments, different charging amounts were determined for the three furnaces. Based on this, operating procedures were formulated, which ensured quality and increased output.

Due to the full implementation of the mass line, the new technical regulations have the characteristics of "three -nesses" and "two -izations." The "three -nesses" are: advancedness, practicality, and clarity. The "two -izations" are: popularization and colloquialization. Advancedness means that the new technical regulations have adopted advanced experiences created by experts and the masses inside and outside the factory, with a total of more than 200 major items. Practicality means that the original regulations have been revised and enriched to adapt to current production practices. In this regard, in addition to retaining more than 6,000 applicable articles, more than 600 articles were modified due to changes in equipment conditions; more than 800 articles were modified because although the original provisions were reasonable, they could not be implemented due to current conditions; more than 1,200 articles were enriched because the original provisions were incomplete; more than 1,100 articles were modified and cancelled because the original provisions were unreasonable or outdated, and more than 2,000 articles were added based on the new situation. Clarity means that the cumbersome and repetitive parts of the original regulations have been merged or simplified. A total of more than 1,800 articles were merged and simplified this time. Popularization and colloquialization mean that the regulations are easy to understand and remember.

Through a series of tasks such as revising operating procedures, starting from the movement on May 20, compared with the first fifty days of the second quarter, the product qualification rate increased by 1.29% for pig iron, 2.37% for electric furnace steel, 3.71% for open-hearth steel, and 5.33% for thin plates. The average daily output of open-hearth steel and thin plates increased by 11% and 3.1%, respectively. The number of engineering quality accidents in capital construction has been greatly reduced. Leaders and employees at all levels have a correct understanding of the dialectical relationship between quantity and quality, speed and quality, and it has become the guiding ideology for production and construction.

    太钢全面修订技术规程
    正确的肯定下来，该恢复的恢复起来，不完整的加以补充，不适用的坚决破除
    本报太原19日电　太原钢铁公司所属各厂，在修订技术操作规程中，把总结群众生产实践和改进技术管理结合起来，出现了生产秩序井井有条，产品质量显著提高的新气象。
    技术操作规程是广大群众每日每时生产活动的依据，从6月上旬开始，这个厂以修订操作规程为主，辅之以修订安全规程和设备使用维护规程，加强技术管理。其作法是用了两周时间，通过大鸣、大放、大字报、展览会、座谈会，对质量问题进行了一次大揭发、大暴露，揭发出有关质量的问题两万七千多个，形成了群众性的自我教育运动。然后领导方面、工人、技术人员，通过分析质量问题，检查技术管理，找出缺点，分别对待。对于原来破的正确的，肯定下来；对于自流了的技术规章，该恢复的恢复，不该恢复的明文废除；对于现在执行的，正确的坚决执行，不完整的进行补充，错误的予以破除。此外，对于意见不一致的较大的技术问题、操作规程和技术管理制度，各厂共集中了二百四十个问题，领导干部、技术人员和老工人，展开了技术大辩论。辩论后，意见仍然不能一致的，就由技术人员和工人结合进行试验，试验得出结论之后，由技术人员和老工人制订出操作规程，经过群众讨论后，贯彻执行。这样群众路线的方法，使技术规程的修订，既充分吸收了群众的实践经验，又和科学理论紧密结合。第二炼钢厂的平炉改为三槽出钢后，在装入量上出现了两种意见：一种主张多装，一种主张少装，大辩论之后，意见仍不一致，后来经过多次试验，确定了三个炉子不同的装入量，在此基础上制订了操作规程，既保证了质量，又提高了产量。
    由于充分贯彻了群众路线，新的技术规程具有“三性”、“两化”的特点。“三性”就是先进性、现实性、明确性。两化就是大众化、口语化。所谓先进性，就是新的技术规程中，采纳了专家建议与厂内外群众创造的先进经验，较大的共有二百多项。所谓现实性，就是将原规程修订和充实之后，与当前生产实践相适应。在这方面，除将适用的六千多条继续保留外，因设备条件变化，修改了六百多条；原来订的虽合理，但因现有条件无法执行而修改了八百多条；因为原来订的不完善，加以充实的一千二百多条；因原订不合理或过时而修改和取消了的一千一百多条，并根据新的情况，增加了两千多条。所谓明确性，就是把原来规程中繁琐重复的部分，作了合并或简化。这次共合并和简化了一千八百多条。所谓大众化、口语化，就是规程订的通俗易懂，容易记忆。
    这个公司通过修订操作规程等一系列的工作，从5月20日运动开始，第二季度的后四十天和前五十天相比较，产品的合格率，生铁提高1.29％，电炉钢提高2.37％，平炉钢提高3.71％，薄板提高5.33％。平炉钢和薄板的平均日产量，分别提高11％和3.1％。基本建设的工程质量事故，大大减少。各级领导和职工，对于产量和质量，进度和质量的辩证关系，有了正确的认识，并已成为生产建设的指导思想。（附图片）
