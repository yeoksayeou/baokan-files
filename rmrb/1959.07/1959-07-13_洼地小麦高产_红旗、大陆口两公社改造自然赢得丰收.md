    High Wheat Yields in Low-lying Areas
    Hongqi and Dalukou Communes Transform Nature and Achieve Bumper Harvests

    (Our report) The Hongqi People's Commune in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, has achieved a large-scale bumper wheat harvest. The commune's 59,003 mu of wheat yielded an average of 401.5 jin per mu.
    The Hongqi People's Commune is located on the left bank of the Huai River, with fertile soil. However, due to its low-lying terrain, it is prone to flooding, coupled with extensive cultivation methods, resulting in relatively low yields.
    The main reasons for this year's large-scale bumper wheat harvest are: water conservancy construction and early sowing, which enabled the wheat to avoid disasters and ensure a good harvest; and the implementation of deep plowing and close planting, which tapped the potential of the land. In the past, even slight rainfall would cause water to accumulate in the low-lying areas, with no way to drain it, often causing waterlogging to the wheat. Now, because a river network has been realized, it is no longer threatened by floods. In the past, wheat here was generally sown after the Frost's Descent solar term, resulting in late maturity and susceptibility to wheat midges and southwest winds, leading to reduced production. Last year, the season was advanced, and sowing began after the Autumn Equinox, advancing the maturity period and avoiding wheat midges and wind disasters. In the past, the wheat fields here were only plowed two or three inches deep. Last year, the plowing depth was generally increased by more than double, turning up the fertile silt and turning the two- or three-inch-thick bean leaves from last year's soybean stubble fields underground as base fertilizer, which increased soil fertility and improved drought resistance and moisture retention. In terms of close planting, in the past, each mu was sown with a maximum of only 18 jin of seeds. Last autumn, generally around 30 jin were sown, and some wheat was also intercropped with beans, tapping the potential of the land.
Xinhua News Agency: The Shanglaodian and other eleven production brigades in the lake depression area of the Dalukou People's Commune in Liangshan County, Shandong Province, overcame difficulties that were insurmountable in the past after communization, and achieved a bumper wheat harvest. The over 40,000 mu of wheat in the low-lying areas of these eleven brigades have all been threshed for the first time, and most have been threshed a second time. Among them, the 10,751 mu of large-area high-yield plots have been completely threshed, and after weighing and verification, the average yield of dry wheat per mu is 408 jin, an increase of 140% compared to last year. According to preliminary estimates, the yield per mu of the remaining 30,000 mu of land has increased by about 80% compared to last year.

    洼地小麦高产
    红旗、大陆口两公社改造自然赢得丰收
    本报讯　安徽省怀远县红旗人民公社获得小麦大面积丰产。全社五万九千零三亩小麦，平均亩产四百零一斤五两。
    红旗人民公社位于淮河左岸，土质肥沃。但因地势低洼，容易遭受水灾，又加耕作粗放，所以产量不很高。
    今年这块小麦获得大面积丰产，主要原因是：兴修水利和提早播种，使小麦得以避灾保收；实行深耕密植，发挥了土地潜力。过去雨量稍大，洼地积水就无处排泄，小麦常常受涝。现在，因为实现了河网化，不再受洪水威胁，过去这里小麦一般在霜降后开始播种，小麦成熟期晚，常遭吸浆虫和西南风的侵袭，造成减产。去年提前了季节，在秋分后就开始播种，提早了成熟期，避开了吸浆虫和风灾。过去这里的麦地只耕二、三寸深，去年耕地深度一般增加一倍以上，把肥沃的淤土翻了上来，把去年豆茬地里的二、三寸厚的豆叶都翻到地下做了基肥，既增加了土地肥力，又提高了防旱保墒能力。在密植方面，过去每亩最多只播种十八斤，去秋一般都下种三十斤左右，部分小麦还实行了豆麦混种，发挥了土地的潜力。
  据新华社讯　山东梁山县大陆口人民公社湖洼地区的商老店等十一个生产大队，公社化后克服了过去无法克服的困难，赢得了小麦大丰收。这十一个大队的四万多亩洼地小麦，已经全部打完头遍，大部分打了二遍。其中一万零七百五十一亩大面积丰产方的小麦，已经全部脱粒完毕，经过秤核实，平均亩产干麦四百零八斤，比去年增加了140％，另外三万多亩地据初步计算，每亩产量比去年增加80％左右。
