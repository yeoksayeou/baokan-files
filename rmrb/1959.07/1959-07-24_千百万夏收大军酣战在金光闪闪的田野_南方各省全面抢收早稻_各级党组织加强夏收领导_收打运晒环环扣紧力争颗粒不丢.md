Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The battle to rush-harvest the first bumper early rice crop since the people's communes were established is now in full swing. Currently, in the southern provinces and regions that produce early rice, it is truly a scene of "golden waves of rice rolling, fragrance carried thousands of miles by the wind." Millions of troops are rushing to harvest and thresh the early rice in a tense but joyful atmosphere, striving to bring every grain home and achieve a bumper harvest.

The harvesting of early rice began in mid-to-late June in the Chaoshan Plain and Pearl River Delta of Guangdong, and along the Jiulong River in Fujian. Subsequently, the early rice in the provinces, cities, and districts of the Yangtze River basin ripened successively and were harvested one after another. Currently, the early rice harvest in Guangdong, Guangxi, and southern Fujian, where the rice matured earlier, is basically completed. In provinces such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan, a labor force of three to five million people is rushing to harvest and thresh the rice every day. In the fields of ripening rice, one can see groups of people harvesting, threshing, and transporting, hear the sound of threshing, and see large, golden piles of grain everywhere.

During the intense harvest, all localities attach great importance to careful harvesting and threshing, striving to bring every grain home and achieve a bumper harvest. Many people's communes in Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, and other provinces and regions have formulated detailed plans or agreements for careful harvesting and threshing. In Guangdong Province, people's communes generally ensure gentle cutting and placement, thorough threshing, and the addition of fences to grain buckets. Production teams in the Longxi Special District of Fujian Province rationally divide labor based on commune members' specialties, ensuring that harvesting, threshing, transporting, and drying are the responsibility of specific individuals. They have also widely implemented methods such as gentle cutting and placement, cutting with the wind, using rice planting boats and large wooden basins to load the cut rice, and padding the threshing ground to reduce losses. In the Fuzhou Special District of Jiangxi Province, communes have universally built and repaired granaries before the early rice is stored, expanding storage capacity to avoid losses from the harvested rice being piled on the ground. The Houshi Brigade of the Liantang'ao People's Commune in Youxian County, Hunan Province, adopted eight measures for careful harvesting and threshing, ensuring that no plants are missed during cutting, no ears of rice are lost during transportation, and no grains are lost during threshing. In Guangxi, many people's communes have divided the work into harvesting, threshing, transporting, and drying groups, and have arranged the rice in queues, ensuring that it is harvested one piece at a time, carefully harvested and threshed again to ensure every grain goes home.

This year, all localities have attached great importance to the early rice harvest, strengthened leadership, arranged labor, and prepared tools. Special districts, counties, and people's communes in Jiangxi Province have universally established headquarters and groups for rushing to harvest and plant. In Guangdong Province, from the county party secretaries to the people's commune party committee secretaries, all are rushing to harvest early rice with the commune members. In Liangyang County, more than 2,500 people, including the county party secretaries, committee members, people's commune party committee secretaries, and cadres from the major brigades, are camping in the fields, participating in the rush harvest, and directing the harvest. Leading cadres, such as the county party secretaries in Fujian, have also gone deep into the fields to harvest and offer suggestions. In Sichuan Province, people's communes everywhere have put the main labor force into the rush-harvesting and planting front as soon as the harvest began. Many people's communes in the Yibin Special District have adopted measures such as streamlining logistics personnel to ensure that more than 70% of the labor force is invested in the "double rush" front. Zhejiang Province has organized 150,000 iron, wood, and bamboo workers to rush-manufacture and repair tools for the summer harvest and planting, and has newly manufactured more than 5.6 million various tools and repaired more than 8.5 million tools. Hunan Province has organized more than 180,000 iron, wood, and other workers to timely repair and manufacture tools for harvesting, transporting, drying, and storing. In Anhui Province, the commercial departments in seven counties, including Wuwei, in the Wuhu Special District alone, have purchased and supplied more than 355,000 pieces of agricultural tools for rural rush harvesting, such as rice threshers and rapid harvesters. Therefore, this year, the early rice harvest is fast and good in all localities. (Attached photo)

    千百万夏收大军酣战在金光闪闪的田野
    南方各省全面抢收早稻
    各级党组织加强夏收领导　收打运晒环环扣紧力争颗粒不丢
    新华社23日讯　人民公社化后首次早稻丰收的抢收战役已经全面展开。目前，在盛产早稻的南方各省区正是“稻浪滚滚金光闪，千里风飘万里香”。千百万抢收抢打的大军，正在紧张、愉快地抢收抢打早稻，力争做到颗粒还家，丰产丰收。
    早稻的收割，从6月中、下旬开始，就在广东的潮汕平原、珠江三角洲和福建的九龙江畔等地展开。接着长江流域各省、市、区的早稻相继黄熟，先后开镰。现在，早稻成熟较早的广东、广西和福建南部地区，已经基本收割完毕。浙江、江苏、安徽、江西、湖南、湖北、四川等省，每天都有三百万到五百万人的劳动大军在突击收打。在黄熟的稻海里，到处都可以看到收、打、运的人群，到处都可以听到打禾的响声，到处都可以看到金光闪闪的高大谷堆。
    在紧张的收割中，各地都很重视精收细打，力争颗粒还家，丰产丰收。广东、广西、浙江、福建、江西、湖南、四川等省区的许多人民公社都制定了细收细打计划或公约。广东省各人民公社一般都做到了轻割轻放、重打打净、谷桶加围。福建龙溪专区各人民公社生产队都根据社员特长合理分工，做到收、打、运、晒有专人负责，还普遍实行了轻割轻放，顺风割，用插秧船、大木盆装割下的稻禾，在打谷地上加垫等办法，减少了损失。江西抚州专区各公社在早稻收割入仓前，普遍建造、修缮了粮仓，扩大了仓容量，避免收下的稻谷堆在地里受损失。湖南攸县莲塘坳人民公社侯市大队采取八项精收细打的措施，保证了割不丢棵，运不丢穗，扮不丢粒。广西许多人民公社按照收、打、运、晒划分了作业组，并进行了稻禾排队，做到了熟一块割一块，细收复打，颗粒还家。
    今年，各地都很重视早稻的收割工作，加强了领导，安排了劳力，准备了工具。江西省各专区、县、人民公社普遍建立了抢收抢种指挥部和小组，广东省各县从县委书记到人民公社党委书记都和社员们一起抢收早稻。两阳县的县委书记、委员、人民公社党委书记和各大队的干部有二千五百多人，在田间安营扎寨，边参加抢收，边指挥收割。福建各县县委书记等负责干部也深入到田间边收割、边出主意。四川省各地人民公社一开始收割就把主要的劳力投入抢收抢插战线。宜宾专区许多人民公社采取精简后勤人员等办法，保证了70％以上的劳动力投入“双抢”战线。浙江全省组织了十五万铁、木、竹工人赶制和抢修夏收夏种工具，已新制出各种工具五百六十多万件，修好八百五十多万件。湖南省组织了十八万多名铁、木等工人，及时修理和制造收、运、晒、藏等工具。安徽省芜湖专区仅无为等七个县的商业部门，就采购供应了农村抢收用的打稻机、快速收割器等农具三十五万五千多件。因此，今年各地早稻收得快、收得好。（附图片）
