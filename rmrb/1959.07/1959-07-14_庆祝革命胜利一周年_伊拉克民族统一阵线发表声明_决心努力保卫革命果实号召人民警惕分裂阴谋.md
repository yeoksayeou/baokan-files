Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 12th. The Political Committee of the Iraqi National United Front issued a statement last night, celebrating the first anniversary of the July 14th Revolution.

The statement said that on the occasion of the first anniversary of the revolution, the National United Front and its three political parties, some people's organizations, and all independent forces participating in the front, "extend the warmest congratulations to the people, the army, and leader Kassem." The National United Front guarantees "to strive to defend the Republic, defend the fruits of the revolution, and thwart the conspiracies of the imperialists."

The statement said that the National United Front calls on the people to be vigilant and prepared to fight against all propaganda of the splitters.

The statement, in reviewing the historical achievements of the National United Front, said that the National United Front "gloriously and actively participated in the struggle to support the national regime and defend the democratic fruits of the Republic and the revolution. Since the establishment of the front before the revolution, these forces have also gloriously participated in the work of preparing for the revolution, mobilizing the people, leading them to overthrow the eradicated imperialist regime, and closely cooperating with the heroic army." The statement said that history shows that the unity of national forces in the National United Front has had a great impact on mobilizing, uniting forces, and enabling the people to fully cooperate with the national forces in the army, and has created the necessary conditions for the success of the revolution.

The statement said that after the success of the revolution, Iraq relied on the united national forces to thwart all the conspiracies of imperialism. This made the imperialists and their running dogs realize that it was impossible for them to restore their lost power by open means. The statement said, therefore, "they began to try to divide the unity of the national ranks and incite national forces to oppose each other in order to defeat them one by one." The statement said that the purpose of the new imperialist conspiracy is to separate the leadership of the revolution from "the main domestic forces in order to overthrow it and restore their collapsed regime."

The statement said that this conspiracy of the imperialists has achieved some results, thereby strengthening the activities of the hateful reactionaries against the loyal national forces. The statement said that the Iraqi people have found that the only way to deal with the new conspiracy of the imperialists is to re-establish the National United Front in accordance with the wishes of millions of people who are enthusiastically defending the Republic and the achievements of the revolution.

    庆祝革命胜利一周年
    伊拉克民族统一阵线发表声明
    决心努力保卫革命果实号召人民警惕分裂阴谋
    新华社巴格达12日电　伊拉克民族统一阵线政治委员会昨晚发表声明，庆祝7月14日革命胜利一周年。
    声明说，在革命胜利一周年的时候，民族统一阵线和它的三个政党、一些人民团体以及参加这个阵线的一切独立的力量，“向人民、军队和领袖卡塞姆致以最热烈的祝贺”。民族统一阵线保证“努力奋斗，来保卫共和国，保卫革命的果实，并且挫败帝国主义者的阴谋诡计”。
    声明说，民族统一阵线号召人民提高警惕，准备同分裂者的一切宣传进行斗争。
    声明在回顾民族统一阵线的历史成就时说，民族统一阵线“光荣地积极参加支持民族政权以及保卫共和国和革命的民主果实的斗争。自从这个阵线在革命前成立以来，这些力量还光荣地参加了准备革命的工作，动员人民，领导他们推翻已被消灭的帝国主义的政权，并且同英勇的军队进行紧密合作”。声明说，历史表明，民族统一阵线中民族力量的团结在动员、团结力量以及使人民同军队中的民族力量进行充分合作方面，具有很大的影响，并且为革命的成功创造了必要的条件。
    声明说，在革命成功以后，伊拉克靠统一的民族力量挫败了帝国主义的一切阴谋。这使帝国主义者和他们的走卒发现：他们要靠公开的手段来恢复失去了的权力已经不可能。声明说，于是，“他们开始力图分裂民族队伍的团结，并且煽动民族力量彼此对立，以便把它们各个击败”。声明说，帝国主义新阴谋的目的是要使革命的领导脱离“国内的主要力量，以便把它推翻，使他们的已垮台的政权复辟”。
    声明说，帝国主义者的这种阴谋已经取得了一些效果，从而使可恨的反动分子加强了他们反对忠实的民族力量的活动。声明说，伊拉克人民发现，对付帝国主义者新阴谋的唯一办法就是依照千百万热心保卫共和国和革命成果的人民的意愿重新建立民族统一阵线。
