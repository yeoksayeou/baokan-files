    Resolution on Strengthening the Core Role of Rural Communist Youth League Grassroots Organizations Among Youth
    (Adopted by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League on July 18, 1959)
    It is imperative to effectively strengthen the grassroots work of the Communist Youth League in rural areas, improve grassroots organizations, and give full play to its core role among youth. The construction of the League must serve the political tasks and central work of the Party and be carried out in actual struggle. It is necessary to educate League members to actively and promptly respond to the Party's calls and care about the major affairs of the country and all the people. Activities must be carried out in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism to give play to the initiative and enthusiasm of League members. Ensuring the Party's leadership is the lifeline of the League. Rural League grassroots organizations must closely obtain the leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations and take the Party's central tasks as the League's central tasks. Strengthening the leadership of county-level and higher League committees over rural League grassroots organizations is an important prerequisite for doing a good job in grassroots work.
    I. More than 600,000 grassroots organizations of the Communist Youth League in rural areas, under the leadership of the Party, closely connect with the broad masses of young people and have played an active role in completing various tasks of socialist construction. Since the Great Leap Forward, especially the rural people's commune movement, the work of rural League grassroots organizations has become more active and their role more significant. However, due to the major changes in social and production organizations, some League leading organs did not take effective measures in time to adjust and improve the League's grassroots organizations. Also, some League cadres have the thought of neglecting grassroots work and the organizational role of the League. As a result, some League grassroots organizations are somewhat loose, the leading core is unsound, and work cannot be carried out normally. This, to a certain extent, has reduced the core role of grassroots organizations among young people and, in reality, has also affected the Party's leadership over youth work. This situation must be changed rapidly. The cause of socialist construction is developing rapidly, and the broad masses of rural youth are fighting alongside all the people to win a bumper autumn harvest, realize the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959, and build a new socialist countryside. This requires better development of the youth mass movement and making the work more in-depth, more meticulous, and more solid. To this end, it is imperative to effectively strengthen the grassroots work of the Communist Youth League in rural areas, improve grassroots organizations, and give full play to its core role among youth.
    II. The fundamental task of League building is to build an advanced, closely connected with the masses, and combat-effective Communist Youth League. In League building, it is imperative to adhere to the basic principles stipulated in the League Constitution and to constantly clarify these principles to the entire League. The construction of the League must serve the political tasks and central work of the Party and be carried out in actual struggle. It is necessary to proceed from the actual situation of the League, take long-term considerations and adopt measures to continuously improve the combat effectiveness of the League's grassroots organizations and improve the quality of League members. It is necessary to attach importance to both the ideological construction and the organizational construction of the League to ensure the political advancement and organizational tightness of the League.
    III. The Communist Youth League is the Party's close assistant and the link between the Party and the masses. Rural League grassroots organizations must fully embody this role, strengthen political and ideological work among young people, actively expand the Party's influence, and truly become a tool for the Party to unite and educate young people. It is necessary to regularly organize and lead League members to study the Party's policies, implement the Party's policies, publicize the Party's policies, and publicize the situation and tasks. For the calls issued by the Party at various times, it is necessary to actively respond, take effective measures, and act quickly. It is necessary to educate League members to care about the major affairs of the country and all the people, dare to adhere to the truth, tell the truth, and report to the Party organization any behavior that violates the interests of the country and the people, and resolutely oppose it. League members should be held to relatively strict requirements politically and ideologically. Educate League members to firmly establish the concept of the Party, the concept of the whole, the class viewpoint, and the mass viewpoint, enhance their sense of political responsibility, and be intimate friends and models of young people. In particular, those League members who hold administrative positions should be given more education and assistance to enable them to do their work better. Strengthening the close ties between the League and the young masses is an important link in giving play to the League's role as an assistant. League grassroots organizations should care about the interests of the masses, frequently understand and reflect the opinions and demands of the masses to the Party organization, and actively help the masses solve some practical problems within possible conditions.
    IV. The Communist Youth League is organized according to the principle of democratic centralism, and must at all times carry out activities in accordance with this principle. There must be full democratic life within the League, as well as centralized leadership and relatively strict discipline. Only in this way can we prevent the organization from being lax, enable League cadres and League members to develop the habit of working and participating in collective life in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism, promote the enthusiasm and initiative of League members, and ensure the unity of the League in thought, organization, and action. Rural League grassroots organizations should gradually establish a relatively complete organizational life system within themselves. Where there are conditions to establish League organizations but have not yet been established, they must be established as soon as possible. All League members must be incorporated into the organization without exception, participate in organizational life, and accept the education and supervision of the League organization. League group meetings, branch League member meetings, and the people's commune League member congresses should be held regularly. At these meetings, the Party's tasks, the League's work, and the immediate problems of the young masses should be discussed, and work tasks should be assigned to League members in order to achieve the purpose of solving problems and educating comrades. League organizations should respect the democratic rights of League members, give League members full opportunity to express their opinions within the League, encourage League members to frankly offer opinions on the League's work; they should patiently listen to different opinions, and allow League members to retain different opinions under the conditions of obeying the majority and implementing resolutions. League members must resolutely implement the resolutions of the League organization and the tasks assigned to them, and report their work, ideological, and learning situations to the League organization. League organizations should check the implementation of resolutions and the completion of tasks by League members. League committees, general branches, and branches should all establish sound committees. The secretaries and members of the committee must be elected through democratic elections and re-elected regularly. This is of great significance for supervising the leading backbone to do a good job, maintaining close ties with League members, and absorbing new activists to enrich the leading core. The committee must meet regularly, adhere to the system of combining collective leadership and division of labor with individual responsibility, give full play to the enthusiasm of each committee member, and form a leading core. All important work and problems within the League should be fully discussed by the committee and decisions made. Criticism and self-criticism should be carried out conscientiously within the League to cultivate a spirit of mutual learning, mutual care, mutual assistance, and mutual supervision among the League's leading backbone and League members, and among League members.
    V. Establishing regular work is an important link in strengthening grassroots work. With regular work, it is possible to maintain close contact with the young masses, systematically accumulate experience, and improve the level of work. The people's commune implements a system of unified leadership and decentralized management, which requires League branches and League groups to play a greater role. It is imperative to attach great importance to strengthening the work of League branches and League groups and give play to their initiative and activeness. League grassroots organizations should, in accordance with the provisions of the League Constitution, regularly carry out political and ideological work among young people, publicize Marxism-Leninism, publicize the Party's policies; organize young people to participate in various production activities; organize young people's cultural and technical learning; care about young people's lives; educate League members and recruit new League members; and lead the work of the Young Pioneers. When carrying out work, League grassroots organizations should, generally speaking, first deliberate, discuss, and deploy within the League, and should not replace League meetings with a package meeting of League members and young activists. It is necessary to conscientiously follow the mass line, listen to the opinions of the masses, patiently consult with the masses, adopt methods of persuasion and education, and influence and lead young people through the exemplary role of League members. It is necessary to be good at leading the broad masses of young people to respect the older generation, learn various useful skills from them; pay attention to obtaining their approval and support in carrying out work, and cooperate closely with them.
    VI. Improve the leading core of grassroots organizations, and recruit new League members. The vacancies of the leading backbone of grassroots organizations should be filled as soon as possible, and those with relatively weak leading cores should be adjusted and strengthened as soon as possible. The conditions for selecting the leading backbone of grassroots organizations should be: firm in position, honest and reliable, diligent and willing to work, and connected to the masses. A large part of the leading backbone of rural League grassroots organizations are newly appointed to the League's leadership work, and they urgently need to be familiar with the League's business. Various methods should be adopted to seize the time to conduct a short-term training for them. League organizations should often attach importance to the development of League members, adding fresh blood to the League, especially in some production units where the number of League members is small or there are no League members, it is even more necessary to develop some new League members in a planned way. League grassroots organizations should formulate plans for the work of developing League members and regularly check the implementation of the situation. Attention should be paid to ensuring the quality of new League members. Commune League committees should approve the resolutions of League branches on the recruitment of new League members in a timely manner.
    VII. Ensuring the Party's leadership is the lifeline of the League. Rural League grassroots organizations must closely obtain the leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations. It is necessary to take the Party's central tasks as the League's central tasks, and under the unified leadership of the Party, actively and proactively carry out work among the young masses in accordance with the Party's work deployment. It is necessary to frequently report the situation to the Party, ask for instructions on work, and make suggestions on related work.
    VIII. Strengthening the leadership of county-level and higher League committees over rural League grassroots organizations is an important prerequisite for doing a good job in grassroots work. League leading organs should face the grassroots and rely on the grassroots in their work. Organizing youth activities and adopting various forms that are suitable for the characteristics of youth and easily mobilize the enthusiasm of youth is necessary; however, the role of League grassroots organizations should not be neglected and the leadership over grassroots work should not be relaxed because of this. When deploying work to grassroots organizations, the actual situation of grassroots organizations should be fully considered, and the level of grassroots cadres should be taken into account, and tasks should be assigned as well as methods explained. It is necessary to go deep into grassroots organizations to check and help with work, and summarize and promote the experience of grassroots work. Attention should be paid to selecting and training grassroots cadres regularly, and urging and helping grassroots cadres to study hard. League newspapers and periodicals, while reporting and publicizing youth activities, should fully reflect the core role played by League grassroots organizations under the leadership of the Party.

    关于加强农村团的基层组织在青年中的核心作用的决议
    （一九五九年七月十八日中国共产主义青年团三届五中全会通过）
    必须切实加强农村团的基层工作，健全基层组织，充分发挥它在青年中的核心作用。　团的建设必须服务于党的政治任务和中心工作，在实际斗争中去进行。　要教育团员积极地迅速地响应党的号召，关心全国、全民的大事。　必须按照民主集中制原则进行活动，发挥团员的积极性和主动性。　保证党的领导是团的生命线，农村团的基层组织必须密切地取得党的基层组织的领导，要以党的中心任务为团的中心任务。　县以上各级团委加强对农村团的基层组织的领导，是做好基层工作的重要前提。
    一、共青团在农村的六十余万个基层组织，在党的领导下，密切地联系着广大青年群众，在完成社会主义建设的各项任务中发挥了积极作用。自从大跃进特别是农村人民公社化以来，农村团的基层组织的工作更加活跃，作用更加显著。但是，由于在社会组织和生产组织大变革的过程中，部分团的领导机关没有及时采取有力的措施，调整和健全团的基层组织，由于一部分团的干部存在着忽视基层工作，忽视团的组织作用的思想，因而部分团的基层组织有些松散，领导核心不健全，工作不能正常开展。这就在一定程度上降低了基层组织在青年中的核心作用，实际上也影响到党对青年工作的领导。这种状况必须迅速改变。社会主义建设事业一日千里地向前发展，广大农村青年正在同全体人民一道，为争取秋季大丰收，实现1959年的继续大跃进而斗争，为建设社会主义的新农村而斗争。这就要求更好地发展青年群众运动，把工作做得更深入一些，更细致一些，更扎实一些。为此，必须切实加强农村团的基层工作，健全基层组织，充分发挥它在青年中的核心作用。
    二、团的建设的根本任务，是建设一个先进的、密切联系群众的、有战斗力的共青团。在团的建设上，必须坚持实行团章所规定的基本原则，并且经常向全团阐明这些原则。团的建设必须服务于党的政治任务和中心工作，在实际斗争中去进行。要从团的实际情况出发、从长期着眼采取措施，不断地提高团的基层组织的战斗力，提高团员的质量。既要重视团的思想建设，又要重视团的组织建设，保证团在政治上的先进性和组织上的严密性。
    三、共青团是党的亲密助手，是党联系群众的纽带。农村团的基层组织必须充分体现这种作用，在青年中加强政治思想工作，积极地扩大党的影响，真正成为党团结教育青年的工具。要经常地组织和领导团员学习党的政策，执行党的政策，宣传党的政策，宣传形势和任务。对于各个时期党所发出的号召，要积极响应，采取有效措施，迅速地行动起来。要教育团员关心全国、全民的大事，勇于坚持真理，说老实话，对于违反国家和人民利益的行为，要报告党组织，要坚决反对。对团员，在政治上、思想上要有比较严格的要求。教育团员牢固地树立党的观念，整体观念，阶级观点，群众观点，增强政治责任感，做青年的知心朋友和模范。特别是对那些担任行政职务的团员，应该给他们更多的教育和帮助，使他们把工作做得更好一些。加强团和青年群众的密切联系，是发挥团的助手作用的重要环节。团的基层组织要关心群众利益，经常了解和向党组织反映群众的意见和要求，在可能的条件下，积极地帮助群众解决一些实际问题。
    四、共青团是按照民主集中制原则组织起来的，任何时候都必须按照这个原则进行活动。团内既要有充分的民主生活，又要有集中领导和比较严格的纪律。这样才能防止组织的涣散，使团的干部和团员养成按照民主集中制原则进行工作和参加集体生活的习惯，发扬团员的积极性和主动性，保证团在思想上、组织上、行动上的一致。农村团的基层组织，应该在自己的内部逐步建立起比较完善的组织生活制度。凡是有条件建立团的组织而没有建立的地方，都必须尽快地建立起来。所有的团员都必须无例外地编入组织，过组织生活，接受团组织的教育和监督。团小组会、支部团员大会、人民公社的团员代表大会要定期召开。在这些会议上，要讨论党的任务，讨论团的工作，讨论青年群众的切身问题，给团员分配工作任务，以达到解决问题和教育同志的目的。团的组织要尊重团员的民主权利，团内要给团员充分发表意见的机会，鼓励团员坦率地对团的工作提意见；要耐心地听取不同的意见，在服从多数和执行决议的条件下，允许团员保留不同的意见。团员要坚决执行团组织的决议和交给的任务，向团组织报告工作情况、思想情况和学习情况。团的组织要检查团员执行决议和完成任务的情况。团委会、总支部、支部都应该建立起健全的委员会。委员会的书记和委员都必须经过民主选举产生，并且定期改选。这对于监督领导骨干做好工作，密切同团员的联系，吸收新的积极分子充实领导核心，具有重要的意义。委员会必须定期开会，坚持实行集体领导和分工负责相结合的制度，充分发挥各个委员的积极性，形成领导核心。团内的一切重要的工作和问题，都应该经过委员会充分讨论，作出决定。团内要认真开展批评和自我批评，在团的领导骨干和团员之间、团员和团员之间，养成互相学习、互相关心、互相帮助、互相监督的风气。
    五、建立经常工作，是加强基层工作的重要环节。有了经常工作，可以同青年群众保持密切的联系，比较系统地积累经验，提高工作水平。人民公社实行统一领导、分级管理制度，要求团支部和团小组发挥更大的作用。必须十分重视加强团支部和团小组的工作，发挥它们的积极性和主动性。团的基层组织应该根据团章的规定，经常在青年中进行政治思想工作，宣传马克思列宁主义，宣传党的政策；组织青年参加各种生产活动；组织青年的文化和技术学习；关心青年的生活；教育团员和接收新团员；领导少年先锋队工作。团的基层组织在进行工作的时候，一般地说，应该先在团内酝酿、讨论和布置，不能用团员和青年积极分子的一揽子会代替团内的会议。要认真地走群众路线，听取群众的意见，耐心和群众商量，采取说服教育的方法，并且通过团员的模范作用来影响和带动青年。要善于带动广大青年尊敬年长的一代，从他们那里学会各种有用的本领；在进行工作时注意取得他们的赞同和支持，同他们亲密合作。
    六、健全基层组织的领导核心，接收新团员。基层组织领导骨干的缺额，应该尽快地补选，领导核心比较薄弱的，要尽快地调整和充实。挑选基层领导骨干的条件应该是：立场坚定，忠诚老实，勤学肯干，联系群众。农村团的基层组织的领导骨干中，有很大一部分是新担任团的领导工作的，他们迫切要求熟悉团的业务，应该采取各种方法，抓紧对他们进行一次短期训练。团的组织要经常重视发展团员，给团内增加新鲜血液，特别是有些生产单位的团员数量较少，或者没有团员，更需要有计划地发展一些新团员。团的基层组织应该就发展团员的工作，作出计划，定期检查执行的情况。要注意保证新团员的质量。公社团委要及时审批团支部接收新团员的决议。
    七、保证党的领导是团的生命线。农村团的基层组织必须密切地取得党的基层组织的领导。要以党的中心任务为团的中心任务，在党的统一领导下，根据党的工作部署，积极地主动地在青年群众中开展工作。要经常向党反映情况，请示工作，并且提出有关工作的建议。
    八、县以上各级团委加强对农村团的基层组织的领导，是做好基层工作的重要前提。团的领导机关在工作中要面向基层，依靠基层。组织青年的活动，采取适合青年特点和易于调动青年的积极性的各种形式，是必要的；但是，不能因此而忽视团的基层组织的作用，放松对基层工作的领导。向基层组织布置工作的时候，要充分地考虑到基层组织的实际情况，照顾到基层干部的水平，既要交给任务，又要交代方法。要深入基层组织检查和帮助工作，总结和推广基层工作的经验。要经常注意挑选和训练基层干部，督促和帮助基层干部努力学习。团的报纸和刊物，在报道和宣传青年活动的同时，要充分地反映团的基层组织在党的领导下所发挥的核心作用。
