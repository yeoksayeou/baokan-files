Making Do with What One Has, Running Schools Diligently and Thriftily
Tianjin's Universities and Colleges Pay Attention to Economy

    (Our dispatch) Tianjin's universities and colleges, through uncovering waste and inventorying materials, have discovered considerable potential for economizing. All schools have further studied and approved their budgets for this year, implementing the principle of running schools diligently and thriftily under the premise of guaranteeing improved educational quality. Items not directly related to teaching, such as administrative expenses and general equipment purchases, are being handled by making do with what one has and making every effort to compress costs. The Tianjin Normal University School Affairs Committee decided that, apart from the necessary beds and desks for new students, general equipment and office supplies will generally no longer be purchased, and old items will be repaired and used in place of new ones. The schools also adhere to the spirit of thrift in their use of funds for teaching instruments, equipment, and books and materials, distinguishing between priorities and using funds in a focused and planned manner, allocating funds to the most urgent needs.
    The schools have all inventoried their stockpiles. The Chemistry Department of Nankai University cleared out surplus chemical raw materials and supplies worth over 22,000 yuan that could be allocated elsewhere. The Electronic Physics Teaching and Research Group of the Physics Department of this school cleared out 300 electron tubes, enough for the group to use for a year. A stocktaking by the Municipal Normal School and two other schools resulted in a surplus of a complete set of instruments for kindergarten teachers and 762 instruments for middle school physics and chemistry experiments. On the basis of inventorying materials, schools and departments exchange resources to make full use of existing materials. Some materials cleared out by schools are centrally allocated by the municipal and district education bureaus to support schools in various counties and newly built schools. In addition, the schools are studying and revising the systems for requisitioning, borrowing, and storing instruments, equipment, and raw materials, with valuable instruments assigned to specific personnel for safekeeping to avoid loss and unnecessary damage.
    The schools have also educated teachers, students, and staff on running schools diligently and thriftily and cherishing public property. Many units have held small exhibitions, inviting veteran cadres to talk about their simple and arduous lives during the revolutionary struggle; some units have commended individuals who have consistently adhered to hard work and plain living. After receiving education, some students have proposed "studying diligently and thriftily"; some students have voluntarily organized to modify and repair discarded items.

    因陋就简  勤俭办学
    天津大中学校注意节约
    本报讯　天津市大中学校通过揭发浪费，清理物资，发现节约潜力相当大。各校都进一步研究和审定了今年的预算，在保证提高教育质量的前提下，贯彻勤俭办校的原则，在预算中，与教学无直接关系的项目如公务费、一般设备购置费等，都采取因陋就简，尽力压缩的办法。天津师范大学校务委员会决定：除增加新生必需的床铺、课桌等外，一般设备和办公用品原则上不再购置，修旧顶新。各校对教学用的仪器设备和图书资料等，也本着节约精神，分清轻重缓急，有重点、有计划地使用经费，把经费用到最急需的地方去。
    各校都清点了库存物资。南开大学化学系清理出多余的、可以拨出去的化工原材料和物资价值达二万二千余元。这个学校物理系电子物理教研组就清理出电子管三百个，可供这个教研组使用一年。市立师范学校等三校清仓结果，多余出一整套幼师用的仪器及中等学校物理、化学实验用的仪器七百六十二件。在清理物资的基础上，各校、各系科之间，互通有无，充分利用现有物资。有些学校清理出来的物资，在市、区教育局统一调拨下，集中支援各县学校及新建学校。此外，各校正在研究和重新修订仪器设备、原材料等的领取、借用、保管等制度，贵重仪器则指定专人负责保管，以避免遗失和不应有的损坏。
    各校还向师生员工进行了勤俭办校、爱护公物的教育。不少单位举办了小型展览会，请老干部讲革命斗争中艰苦朴素的生活；有的单位对一贯坚持艰苦朴素的人物进行了表扬。有的学校学生受到教育之后，提出要“勤俭读书”；有的学生自动组织起来，将废旧物品进行改装和修复。　（曾自牧）（附图片）
