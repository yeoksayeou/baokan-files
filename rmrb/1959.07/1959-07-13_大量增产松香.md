Massively Increase Rosin Production
*People's Daily* Commentator

Rosin is one of thousands of industrial raw materials. It may not seem significant, and the quantity needed by industrial (including handicraft) sectors may not be very large. However, it should not be underestimated. Rosin has many uses; it possesses properties such as moisture resistance, insulation, emulsification, corrosion resistance, and adhesion. Its industrial applications are very wide-ranging. Not only is this raw material needed for the production of various daily-use industrial products, but it is also indispensable in large-scale industrial production such as steel, machine tools, and automobiles. A shortage of rosin would affect production in many industrial sectors and reduce the quality of certain industrial products. Furthermore, rosin is also an important export commodity for our country.

In recent years, the development of rosin production in our country has been very rapid. In 1957, the output already reached 120,000 tons, which is more than six times the highest annual output before the war (1936). However, with the rapid development of industrial production in our country, the demand for rosin from many industrial sectors has also increased. Currently, making every effort to develop rosin production and striving to overfulfill the state-mandated rosin production tasks to meet the needs of various industrial sectors and exports is a major matter of national economy and people's livelihood, which must be given sufficient attention.

Our country has good conditions for developing rosin production. First, our country has abundant pine resin resources in various regions. The southern provinces have a large amount of Yunnan pine, Masson's pine, and other pine trees available for resin tapping. According to survey data estimates, if one-fourth of these pine trees are used for resin tapping, this year's rosin production tasks can be completed. In addition, larch, red pine, and other pine trees can also be used for resin tapping. Second, in recent years, many rosin-producing areas have accumulated a lot of experience in resin tapping and rosin processing, and have a certain foundation in terms of technical strength and equipment. Third, people's communes in various places are carrying out diversified operations, which is also very beneficial to increasing rosin production. All of these circumstances indicate that the objective conditions for vigorously developing rosin production are very good. As long as the local Party committees strengthen specific leadership over rosin production, actively take measures, and fully utilize various favorable conditions, it is entirely possible to complete and strive to overfulfill this year's rosin production tasks.

At present, the existing equipment capacity in most regions is compatible with this year's rosin processing tasks, and some regions have great potential. The main problem currently is how to organize labor to vigorously tap pine resin. It is now the peak season for resin tapping, but in some areas, especially major rosin-producing areas, the arrangements for labor for resin tapping are still insufficient. If the peak season is missed and tapping is organized later, it will inevitably affect the output of pine resin. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to solve the labor problem from multiple perspectives. Recently, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the Fenglin Forestry Bureau of Heilongjiang has regarded rosin production as an important task and deployed it, and strengthened leadership over rosin production by mobilizing forces without affecting timber production. The number of resin tappers quickly increased from the original 30 to 120. According to statistics up to June 25, more than 3,700 catties of pine resin have been tapped, and more than 1,000 catties of rosin have been refined using indigenous methods, greatly exceeding the original production plan. It can be seen that as long as the Party committee and leading departments pay attention to grasping this work, the labor problem can be appropriately resolved.

Establishing specialized resin-tapping teams to improve labor efficiency is also an important way to solve the labor shortage. We know that tapping pine resin requires a lot of labor. However, due to different conditions in labor organization management and technical level, the difference in the quantity produced by each laborer each year is also very large. Establishing a specialized team facilitates strengthening management and improving technical level. For example, ordinary laborers can tap an average of half a ton to one ton of pine resin per person per year, while specialized teams can tap an average of about five tons of pine resin per person per year. This fully illustrates that the establishment of specialized resin-tapping teams and actively leading them can save a lot of labor and ensure the completion of tasks.

Forestry, commercial, and other departments should also actively help people's communes and production teams tap pine resin. Currently, it is the busy farming season, and the labor force of the people's communes is relatively tight. However, as long as the people's communes make reasonable arrangements for the labor force based on the principle of overall planning and comprehensive consideration, they can still spare a certain number of people to tap pine resin. The people's communes tapping pine resin not only supports industrial production but also increases the income of the communes, which is beneficial to both the country and the communes. Of course, the people's communes should pay attention to correctly solving the labor remuneration problem of resin tappers based on the principles of distribution according to work, more work more gain, and extra rewards. If this problem is solved well, the enthusiasm of the commune members for tapping pine resin will be greatly improved.

To massively increase rosin production, it is necessary to vigorously promote advanced resin-tapping technologies and experiences, such as "tapping resin before felling," "chemical intensive resin tapping," and "four-season resin tapping." These methods are effective and can increase production. Currently, they should be promoted in areas with the appropriate conditions to increase pine resin resources and expand rosin production. Relevant leading departments at all levels should also continuously strengthen inspection work and help solve difficulties and specific problems in production to ensure the completion of pine resin tapping and rosin production tasks on a ten-day, monthly, and quarterly basis. Commercial departments should especially strengthen the purchase and allocation of rosin so that the rosin produced can be quickly and timely supplied to the market.

    大量增产松香
    本报评论员
    松香，这是千百种工业原料的一种。它看起来不显眼，工业（包括手工业）部门需用它的数量也不算很大。但是，切不可因此而小看了它。松香的用处很大，它有着防潮、绝缘、乳化、防腐、粘着等多种性能，在工业上的用途是十分广泛的；不仅生产各种日用工业品需要这种原料，就是在钢铁、机床、汽车等大工业生产上也少不了这种原料。缺少了它，就会使许多工业部门的生产受到影响，就会降低某些工业产品的质量。更不用说松香还是我国一项重要的出口物资了。
    几年来，我国松香生产的发展是很迅速的。1957年的产量就已经达到十二万吨，比战前（1936年）的最高年产量增加了六倍还多。但是随着我国工业生产的迅速发展，许多工业部门对松香的需要也日益增加了。当前，尽一切努力发展松香生产，争取超额完成国家规定的松香生产任务，以满足各个工业部门对松香的需求和出口的需要，这是一件关系国计民生的大事，必须引起我们足够的重视。
    我国发展松香生产有着良好的条件。首先，我国各地松脂资源十分丰富。南方各省有大量的可供采割松脂的云南松、马尾松等松材。根据调查材料推算，如果利用这些松树的四分之一采割松脂，就可以完成今年的松香生产任务。此外，落叶松、红松等松材也都可以采割松脂。其次，几年来，不少松香产区在松脂的采割和松香加工等方面已经积累了不少经验，并在技术力量和设备方面，也有了一定的基础。第三，各地人民公社正在开展多种经营，这对增产松香也是很有利的。所有这些情况都说明了当前大力发展松香生产的客观条件是十分良好的，只要各地党委加强对松香生产的具体领导，积极采取措施，充分发挥和利用各种有利条件，完成并争取超额完成今年松香的生产任务，是完全可能的。
    目前绝大部分地区现有设备能力和今年的松香加工任务是相适应的，有的地区潜力还很大。当前的主要问题是如何组织劳动力大力采割松脂。现在已经进入采割松脂的旺季，但是有些地区，特别是松香主要产区对采割松脂的劳动力的安排还是不足的，如果错过了旺季再组织采割，就必然要影响松脂的产量。因此，必须从多方面想办法解决劳动力问题。最近一个时期，黑龙江丰林林业局在党委的统一领导下，把松香生产当作一项重要的任务布置下去，并且在不影响木材生产的情况下调动力量加强了对松香生产的领导。采脂人员很快地由原来的三十人增加到一百二十人。到6月25日的统计，已经采割了三千七百多斤松脂，并用土法炼制出一千多斤松香，大大超过了原订的生产计划。可见，只要党委和领导部门注意抓这件工作，劳动力问题是可以适当解决的。
    建立采脂专业队，提高劳动效率，也是解决劳动力不足的一个重要办法。我们知道，采割松脂是需要较多的劳动力的。但是由于对劳动力组织管理和技术水平的条件不同，每个劳动力每年生产的数量的差别也是很大的。建立专业队就便于加强管理和提高技术水平。例如，一般的劳动力每人每年平均可采割松脂半吨到一吨，而专业队每人每年平均就可采松脂五吨左右。这就充分说明，成立专业采脂队并积极加以领导既能节约大量劳动力，又能保证完成任务。
    林业、商业等部门还应该积极帮助人民公社和生产队采割松脂。目前正是农忙季节，人民公社的劳动力是比较紧张的。但是人民公社只要本着统筹兼顾的原则对劳动力加以合理安排，还是可以抽出一定的人来采割松脂的。人民公社采割松脂，不仅支援了工业生产，而且增加了公社的收入，不论对国家对公社都是有好处的。当然，人民公社应该注意根据按劳分配、多劳多得和超额奖励的原则，正确地解决采脂人员的劳动报酬问题。这个问题解决得好，社员采割松脂的积极性就会大大提高。
    要大量增产松香，必须大力推广先进的采脂技术和经验，如“先采脂后砍伐”“化学强度采脂”“四季采脂”等，这些办法都是行之有效、能够增产的，当前在有条件的地区都应当加以推广，以增加松脂资源，扩大松香的生产。各级有关领导部门还应当不断地加强检查工作，帮助解决生产中的困难和具体问题，以保证按旬、按月、按季地完成松脂的采割和松香的生产任务。商业部门特别应当加强松香的收购和调拨工作，以便迅速及时地把生产出来的松香源源供应市场需要。
