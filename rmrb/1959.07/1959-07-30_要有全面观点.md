Currently, it is the time when southern provinces need to strengthen field management of mid-season rice and late-season rice, and northern provinces need to strengthen field management of major autumn crops such as millet, corn, and sorghum; it is also the time when peanuts, sesame, cotton, and many other cash crops are growing vigorously and need to be strengthened in management. Can we manage grain crops and cash crops well at the same time? Can we manage major crops and minor crops well? Can we manage paddy field crops and dry land crops well, and strive for increased production and bumper harvests for all crops? The farmers of Sichuan Province have given a positive answer with their practical actions. After the summer harvest and summer planting were basically completed, the mid-season rice in Sichuan Province had generally been cultivated and top-dressed once, and half of it had been cultivated and top-dressed twice. One-third of the corn had been cultivated twice, and the sweet potatoes had been top-dressed while being planted. The second top-dressing and weeding of cotton fields had basically been completed. Other crops such as peanuts, sesame, and beans have also been strengthened in management on time, and all kinds of crops are growing vigorously and luxuriantly.

Why can Sichuan Province manage other crops well while managing rice well? The main reason is that leaders and the masses have established a comprehensive view of developing production. Establishing a comprehensive view is very important. Whether it is doing work or engaging in production, we need to have a comprehensive view. With a comprehensive view in doing work, we will not be inconsistent and will not make mistakes of one-sidedness. With a comprehensive view in production, we can make our production develop in a comprehensive and balanced way. Just imagine, if we only grasp grain crops and not cash crops, or only grasp major crops and not minor crops, what impact will our country's construction and people's economic life be affected? Of course, grain crops are the marshal of our entire agricultural front and need to be vigorously grasped. But we cannot ignore or even completely fail to grasp minor crops. The laws of production itself require comprehensive and balanced development; increasing the income of communes and members also requires comprehensive development of production.

Some comrades feel that: to grasp multiple crops, the scope is too broad and we can't take care of it all. The reason why we can't take care of it all is probably because we lack methods and don't know how to arrange things. But more importantly, it is the lack of a comprehensive view. Methods and a comprehensive view seem to be two unrelated things, but in fact, they have a close relationship. With a comprehensive view, we can take overall consideration and make comprehensive arrangements, and we will have a way to solve the difficulty of not being able to take care of it all. Agricultural production is the same. With the view of a comprehensive bumper harvest, the broad masses of commune members can be determined to strive for a bumper harvest of all crops, and have the strength to overcome difficulties. Some communes and teams in Sichuan Province originally also had a one-sided view of bumper harvests, saying, "Just grow grain well, and whatever else is harvested is fine"; some communes and teams also emphasized that "labor is too tight and we can't keep up." However, after the leadership vigorously carried out publicity among the masses, explained the significance of a comprehensive bumper harvest, and educated the peasants to establish a comprehensive bumper harvest view, specific problems such as labor and fertilizer were also resolved under overall consideration and comprehensive arrangements. It can be seen that establishing a comprehensive view is the key to achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest.

    要有全面观点
    蜀嘉
    目前，正是南方各省需要加强中稻、晚稻田间管理，北方需要加强谷子、玉米、高粱等大秋作物田间管理的时候；也正是花生、芝麻、棉花以及其他很多经济作物生长旺盛需要加强管理的时候。能不能在同一时期既管好粮食作物，又管好经济作物？既管好大宗作物，又管好小宗作物？既管好水田作物又管好旱地作物，力争样样作物增产丰收？四川省的农民以实际行动作了肯定的回答。在夏收夏种基本结束以后，四川省的中稻已普遍中耕追肥一次，有一半已中耕追肥二次，玉米也有三分之一中耕了二次，红苕边栽边施了追肥，棉田第二次追肥锄草已基本结束。其他花生、芝麻、豆类等作物，也都按时加强了管理，各种作物都生长得茁壮、旺盛。
    四川省为什么能在管好水稻的同时，又能管好其他各种作物？主要是领导和群众树立了发展生产的全面观点。树立全面观点很重要，不论是做工作、搞生产都需要有全面观点。做工作，有了全面观点，就不致顾此失彼，就不致犯片面性的毛病。搞生产，有了全面观点，就可以使我们的生产综合平衡发展。试想，假使我们只抓粮食作物不抓经济作物，或只抓大宗作物不抓小宗作物，我们国家的建设和人民的经济生活将受到怎样的影响？当然，粮食作物是我们整个农业战线的元帅，需要大力抓。但并不能忽视甚至根本不抓小宗作物，生产本身规律，要求综合平衡发展；增加公社和社员收入，也需要有生产的全面发展。
    有些同志感到：要抓多种作物，方面太广，顾不过来。顾不过来的原因，很可能是缺少办法、不会安排。但更重要的是缺乏全面观点。办法和全面观点，看起来好像是各不相干的两回事，其实，却有密切关系。有了全面观点，就会统筹兼顾、全面安排，就有了解决顾不过来的困难的办法。农业生产也是同样，有了全面丰收的观点，广大社员就能下决心为争取样样作物丰收而努力，才有力量战胜困难。四川省原来有些社、队也有片面丰收的观点，说什么“只要种好粮食就行了，别的收多少算多少”；也有一些社、队强调“劳力太紧忙不赢”。但是，经过领导上大张旗鼓地在群众中开展了宣传，说明了全面丰收的意义，教育农民树立全面丰收的观点以后，劳力、肥料等具体问题也在统筹兼顾、全面安排下得到解决了。可见，树立全面观点，是争取全面丰收的关键。
