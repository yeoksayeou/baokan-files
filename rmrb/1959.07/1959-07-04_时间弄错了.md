    Time Mistaken
    In the article "On China's First Pharmacopoeia in History" published on page 7 of the People's Daily on May 25th, it stated: The Tang Dynasty Ben Cao fragments discovered in the Dunhuang Stone Chamber were stolen to Britain and France due to the collusion between the Kuomintang reactionary government and imperialist elements. However, according to Dunhuang studies, it was primarily American imperialism that looted Dunhuang antiquities during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government. As for the Tang Dynasty Ben Cao fragments in the Dunhuang Stone Chamber, they were stolen by the British Stein (1907) and the French Pelliot (1908) at the end of the Qing Dynasty.

    The reader's opinion is correct. The original author did not examine it carefully and made a mistake with the time.

    5月25日人民日报第七版所载“谈我国历史上第一部药典”一文中说：敦煌石室中发现的唐本草残本，由于国民党反动政府和帝国主义分子勾结，被盗往英国和法国。但是，根据敦煌学的研究，在国民党反动政府统治时期，盗劫敦煌古物的主要是美帝国主义。至于敦煌石室中的唐本草残本，则是在清朝末年，被英国斯坦因（1907年）和法国伯希和（1908年）盗走的。

    读者的意见是对的。原文作者未经细考，把时间弄错了。
