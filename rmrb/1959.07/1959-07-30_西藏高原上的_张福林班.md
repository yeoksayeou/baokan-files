    The "Zhang Fulin Class" on the Tibetan Plateau

    One morning in mid-July, the Yarlung Tsangpo River shimmered with sunlight, and white clouds drifted among the forests on both banks. The soldiers of the "Zhang Fulin Class" of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were saying goodbye to their landlords. Zaxi, a member of the village's rebellion suppression and production committee, said: "These days, we have lived together like brothers. You have protected us, helped us, and taught me many truths. Now that the rebellion has been quelled and democratic reform is about to begin, I am very grateful to you." Squad leader Yu Shoukang shook Zaxi's hand and repeatedly said: "This is our duty. We hold guns in one hand and picks in the other in Tibet, all to make the Tibetan people live a happy life." Then, reluctantly, they boarded a yak-hide boat and sailed towards their new defense area.
    The "Zhang Fulin Class" entered Tibet in 1950. In the past nine years, although the squad leader has changed several times, old soldiers have been discharged in batches, and new soldiers have increased every year, they have always seen it as their responsibility to build Tibet and considered it an honor to care for the suffering of the people, sowing the seeds of revolution wherever they went. Especially after Zhang Fulin's glorious sacrifice, Zhang Fulin's exemplary deeds became a model for all the soldiers in the class to serve the Tibetan people wholeheartedly.
    Zhang Fulin died gloriously while building the Kangzang Highway. It was in November 1951. Mount Que'er, at an altitude of more than 5,000 meters, was covered in white snow, and the temperature dropped to a point where the mercury column on the thermometer was below zero. Zhang Fulin, who had repeatedly made meritorious contributions in the battles of crossing the Yangtze River and advancing into the Great Southwest, joined the road construction project. One day at noon, he went to check the blasting holes dug by his comrades when suddenly a large, sharp rock fell from the cliff and hit him in the waist. This son, born into a poor peasant family in Fugou County, Henan Province, dedicated his precious life to the construction of Tibet for the benefit of the Tibetan people. In order to commend his achievements and promote his spirit, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army posthumously recognized him as a model Communist Party member and named the class he belonged to during his lifetime the "Zhang Fulin Class."
    Afterward, the soldiers of the "Zhang Fulin Class," holding high Zhang Fulin's banner, worked with fraternal units to build the Kangzang Highway to Lhasa. In the process of road construction, this class always shouldered the most arduous tasks. Near the completion of the entire line, they were opening mountains and splitting rocks at the foot of the Sejila Mountain, with a deadline of seven days. They reformed tools and improved construction methods, completing the task in three days. With the remaining time, they built a wooden bridge leading to the village for the local Tibetans with the permission of their superiors. The local Tibetan people presented them with Hada and ghee, saying that they were worthy of being good soldiers of Chairman Mao and requested that the bridge be called "Zhang Fulin Bridge." Because all the soldiers in the class were good at working hard and cleverly, and every task was completed excellently, the entire class received merit every year, and everyone received merit. Squad leader Wen Shaohua was awarded first-class merit to fourth-class merit nine times. After the Kangzang Highway was opened to traffic, he represented the entire class at the National Model Highway Representatives Conference and participated in the World Youth Festival held in Warsaw. The congratulatory letters and gifts they received came from all over the country, and their friends reached fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary.
    After the Kangzang Highway was opened to traffic, the troops on the Tibetan Plateau shifted to production and construction. The "Zhang Fulin Class" continued to perform outstandingly in various tasks such as logging, building houses, and helping the masses in production, and they still received merit every year.
    In 1955, while they were logging in Binge Village on the banks of the Niyang River, a forest fire broke out one night, endangering the Tibetan villagers' village. The soldiers of the "Zhang Fulin Class" waded through the rapids and worked with fraternal units to extinguish the mountain fire. In 1956, the surging flood of the Lhasa River threatened the urban area of Lhasa. The "Zhang Fulin Class" was immersed in the water all day long like in a battle, building stone dams and repairing river embankments, working with fraternal units to protect the urban area of Lhasa from flooding. During this period, wherever they lived, they helped the masses carry water, chop firewood, repair houses, mend roads, cultivate land, and harvest crops.
    This year, the reactionary upper class group in Tibet launched an armed rebellion. The "Zhang Fulin Class" and the troops stationed in Tibet quickly joined the battle to quell the rebellion. Squad leader Wen Shaohua bravely led his soldiers in capturing the rebel stronghold in Nyemo Dzong. While annihilating the enemy, he sacrificed his life for the Tibetan people. The soldiers of the "Zhang Fulin Class" turned their grief into strength, pursuing and annihilating bandits and searching for remnants of the enemy in the vast area of the middle reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, winning every battle.
    In this way, the "Zhang Fulin Class" established indelible achievements for the motherland and the Tibetan people with their blood and sweat.

    西藏高原上的“张福林班”
    新华社记者　赵家烈
    7月中旬的一个早晨，雅鲁藏布江闪耀着阳光，两岸森林间白云袅袅。中国人民解放军某部“张福林班”的战士，正在与房东告别。村平叛生产委员会委员扎西说：“这些日子，我们像亲兄弟一样相处，你们保卫我们，帮助我们，并使我懂得许多道理，现在叛乱平息了，民主改革快要开始了，我非常感谢你们。”班长余寿康握着扎西的手，一再说：“这是我们的责任，我们在西藏一手持枪，一手拿镐，就是为了使藏族同胞过幸福的日子。”然后，依依不舍地登上牛皮船，驶向了新防区。
    “张福林班”是1950年进军西藏的。近九年来，这个班虽然班长换了几个，老战士成批复员，新战士年年增加。可是，他们始终这样，时刻以建设西藏为己任，以关心人民疾苦为光荣，走到那里把革命的种籽播到那里。特别是张福林光荣牺牲以后，张福林的模范事迹，成了全班战士为西藏人民忠心服务的榜样。
    张福林是在修筑康藏公路时光荣牺牲的。那是1951年11月间，海拔五千多米的雀儿山白雪皑皑，温度降到寒暑表水银柱零度以下没有刻度数的地方。曾经在渡长江、进军大西南历次战斗中，屡建功勋的张福林，又投入了筑路工程。一天中午，他去检查同伴们打好的炮坑，突然一块大尖石从崖上掉下来，砸在他的腰上。这个出生在河南扶沟县贫农家中的儿子，为西藏人民的建设事业，献出了宝贵的生命。解放军某部，为了表彰他的功绩，发扬他的精神，追认他为模范共产党员，命名他生前所在的班为
  “张福林班”。
    以后，“张福林班”的战士，高举着张福林的旗帜，和兄弟部队一道，把康藏公路修到拉萨。在修路过程中，这个班始终担负着最艰巨的任务。在临近全线通车的时候，他们在色其拉山下开山劈石，限期七天完成，他们改革工具，改进施工方法，三天就完成了。剩下来的时间，他们经上级允许，给当地藏胞修了一座通往村寨的木桥。当地藏族人民向他们献哈达、送酥油，说他们不愧为毛主席的好战士，要求把这座桥叫“张福林桥”。由于全班战士善于猛干巧干，样样工作完成得都出色，全班年年立功，人人立功。班长文绍华立了一等功到四等功九次。康藏公路通车后，他代表全班出席了全国公路模范代表大会，参加了在华沙举行的世界青年联欢节。他们收到的贺信和礼品来自祖国各地，他们的朋友远及苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利等兄弟国家。
    康藏公路通车后，西藏高原上的部队，转入了生产建设。“张福林班”在伐木、造屋、帮助群众生产等各项工作中，依然作得很出色，仍是年年立功。
    1955年，他们在尼洗河畔宾格村伐木时，一天夜里，森林起了大火，危及藏胞村庄，“张福林班”的战士趟过激流，和兄弟部队一起扑灭了山火。1956年，拉萨河滚滚洪水威胁着拉萨市区，“张福林班”又像作战一样成天泡在水里，砌石垒坝，抢修河堤，和兄弟部队一道，使拉萨市区免受洪水侵袭。这期间，他们住到那里，就在那里帮助群众背水、打柴、修房、补路、耕种和收割庄稼。
    今年，西藏上层反动集团发动了武装叛乱，“张福林班”和驻藏部队一起，迅速投入了平叛战斗。班长文绍华在率领战士们攻占尼木宗叛军据点时，奋不顾身，在消灭了敌人的同时，自己为西藏人民献出了生命。“张福林班”的战士把悲痛化为力量，在雅鲁藏布江中游的广大地区，追歼叛匪，搜捕残敌，屡战皆胜。
    “张福林班”就这样用血汗，为祖国、为西藏人民建立了不可磨灭的功绩。
