    Experience Introduction
    Descending Method of Resin Tapping
    China's old resin tapping technology was very backward. Most of it involved horizontally cutting the tree trunk from the roots upwards, forming a straight line, or digging holes in the trunk and chopping away the edge wood, allowing the resin to flow onto the trunk and ground, and then collecting it in winter. Due to the backwardness of resin tapping technology, not only was the resin yield low and the quality poor, but it also affected the growth of trees and the utilization of timber.
    Since the promotion of the Soviet descending method of resin tapping began in 1951 after liberation, China's resin tapping technology has made great progress. Experience in Guangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui, and northern Guangdong has proven that using the descending method of resin tapping can increase resin yield by about 10% compared to the ascending method. The quality of the resin is also better, with turpentine content generally ranging from 18% to 22%, and impurity content below 0.5%, mostly Grade A resin. Because this resin tapping method determines the cutting face load rate based on the size of the tree's diameter, combined with the logging plan, long-term resin tapping, intensive resin tapping (opening several grooves on one tree simultaneously), and chemical resin tapping (injecting chemical agents into the trunk to stimulate resin secretion) are carried out separately, so resin resources can be fully utilized. For example, in Hunan Province, pine trees that are to be felled within three years are subjected to intensive resin tapping using the descending method; trees that are to be felled within one to two years are subjected to chemical resin tapping, with yields more than double that of the old method. This shows the superiority of the descending method of resin tapping.
    In promoting the descending method of resin tapping, attention should also be paid to summarizing and promoting the experience created by China's resin tapping workers, such as making the middle groove short, straight, and smooth during cutting; making the side grooves narrow (about two centimeters), with the outside slightly higher than the inside, and sloping inward; using sharp cutting knives and applying even force; cutting each tree no more than once a day, and stopping for three or seven days to allow the trees to rest appropriately; leaving sufficient nutrient bands; installing the receptacles properly to reduce impurities and the volatilization of turpentine; and protecting the forests by not cutting young trees or mother trees, and preventing fires. Only in this way can the effectiveness of the descending method of resin tapping be better发挥发挥.

    经验介绍
    下降式采脂法
    我国旧有的采脂技术很落后，大部分都是沿树干根株逐渐向上横割，呈一字形，或在树干上挖孔和用刀斧砍去树边材，让松脂流在树干和地面上，到冬季再拣拾。由于采脂技术落后，不仅松脂产量低、质量差；而且还影响树木的生长和木材利用。
    解放后，一九五一年开始推行苏联的下降式采脂法以来，我国的采脂技术有了很大的进展。在广西、湖南、福建、江西、安徽及粤北等地区推行的经验证明，用下降式采脂法采脂，松脂的产量约比上升法多百分之十，松脂的质量也好，松节油含量一般为百分之十八到百分之二十二，杂质含量低于百分之零点五，多为一级松脂。由于这种采脂法是根据树木的直径大小，结合采伐计划确定割面负荷率，分别进行长年采脂、强度采脂（一棵树同时开几个沟）和化学采脂（把化学药剂注入树干、刺激松脂分泌），所以可以充分利用松脂资源。如湖南省对于在三年内采伐的松树，就用下降式采脂法进行强度采脂；对于一年到两年内采伐的树木，就进行化学采脂，产量比旧法高一倍以上。由此可以看出下降式采脂法的优越性。
    推广下降式采脂法，还应该注意总结推广我国采脂工人所创造的经验，如开割中沟要短、要直、要平滑；侧沟要窄（约二厘米），外边要稍比里边高，并向内倾斜；割刀要锋利，用力要匀；每株树一天最多割一次，隔三天或七天停割一次，让树木适当休息；要留足营养带；受器要装置好，以减少杂质和松节油的挥发；为了保护森林，不割幼树母树，还要防火，这样才能更好的发挥下降式采脂法的效力。
