    “People's Literature” Has Been Improved Well
    Hu Yue
    The July issue of "People's Literature" has been reset to a No. 5 font, and the spacing between lines has also been increased. Although this is only a slight change in form, I think this "slight change" is also a considerable "benefit" to readers. Some people may think this is not a big deal. The old No. 5 font is only half a size smaller than the new No. 5 font, and only one size larger than the No. 6 font. It's not too small; it's not too big either. Making do with it won't necessarily damage "eyesight." This is indeed nothing for young and strong lads with normal eyesight. Perhaps even if there is something, it is a long-term "wear and tear" that is not immediately noticeable. However, for elderly people whose eyesight is declining, or adolescents who are developing, this is a case of "a miss is as good as a mile."
  "A page full of dense words, with lines so close together that even a needle tip cannot be inserted, is dizzying to read." A large number of publications and books flow to people's cultural life uninterruptedly. For knowledge-thirsty old or young readers, how can this not affect their eyesight? An old comrade deeply affected by "nearsightedness" said that his own life had been greatly harmed by "nearsightedness," and he did not expect his two children to start becoming nearsighted so early. But with the current newspapers and periodicals having such dense small fonts, how can it not "create" more nearsightedness? Therefore, this change to a larger font size should not be taken lightly. If all newspaper and magazine editorial departments could do this, it would also be a great thing beneficial to the health of hundreds of millions of people marching towards culture.
    With the change to a larger font size, there will be the problem of reducing the number of words per issue of the publication. From the point of view of saving, will this be a waste of paper? The "Editor's Note" of "People's Literature" says it well: "If we want to talk about saving, it depends on us editors doing our job well, and not printing articles that are passable but not worthy of being published, wasting readers' time and energy." Regarding this point, I agree with the opinion that in the field of culture and art, the main standard is quality. Reading a thousand or a hundred mediocre works is not as beneficial as reading ten excellent works.
    Frankly speaking, if the newspaper and magazine editors' main energy is not spent on providing good spiritual food for readers, but is instead spent on filling each issue with dense words and being exhausted, no matter how much labor they put in, they are actually not fulfilling the mission entrusted to them by the people.

    “人民文学”改得好
    胡约
    七月号“人民文学”改排老五号了，行与行中间也排得稀了，这虽然只是形式上略加改变一下，我觉得这“略加改变”，也是给读者“造福”不浅的。也许有人以为这不是什么大问题，老五号比新五号只差半号，比六号也只大一号。小，小不到哪里；大，也大不到哪里，将就着看也不一定会损害“视力”。这对于视力正常年轻力壮的小伙子来说，确实没有什么，也许即使有什么，也是长期的“消磨”，一时觉察不出来。可是，对于视力正在衰退的老年人，或者正在发育的少年，这却是“失之毫厘，差以千里”的。
  “一版密密麻麻的字，一行一行挤得针尖儿都点不进去，看得头晕眼花”。大量的刊物书籍一点也不间断地流向人们的文化生活，对于如饥如渴的老的或小的求知的读者，能会不影响他们的视力吗？一位深受“近视眼”影响阅读的老同志说，他自己的一生已受
  “近视”之害不浅，没想到自己的两个孩子这样早也开始近视了。但像目前报刊这样密密麻麻的小字，怎么能不更多地“制造”近视眼呢？因此，这改排大号字，确实不该等闲视之，如果所有的报刊编辑部都能这样做，这也是一件有益于向文化进军的几亿人民健康的大事情。
    改排大号字，随之而来的就是刊物每期字数要减少的问题，从节约的观点来看，这会不会是纸张的浪费呢？“人民文学”的“编者的话”说得好：“要讲节约，倒在于我们编者把工作做好，不要印出可登不可登的文章来，浪费读者的时间和精力。”关于这一点，我同意这样的意见：在文化艺术的领域里，主要的标准是质量，读一千篇、一百篇平庸的作品，不如读十篇精采的作品更为有益。
    说实在的，如果报刊编辑同志，主要的精力不是用在为读者提供好的精神食粮上面，而是为了填满每期刊物的密密麻麻的字数而疲于奔命，不管他付出了多少劳动，实际上也是没有完成人民付托给他的使命的。
