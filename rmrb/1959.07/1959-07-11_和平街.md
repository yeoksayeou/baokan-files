Peace Street

Mongolia Sè·Dào'ěrjípàlámù

We who live on Peace Street, do not wish to move away from here,
It is an ordinary street in the capital,
We give it this beautiful name.
Although there are no tall buildings here,
In my heart, it is so dear,
Strolling on its flat road,
The fresh breeze is so cool.
When the spring sun rises from the east,
The ancient fir and elm branches shine,
When dark-eyed children go home with schoolbags,
Our Peace Street is even more splendid.
When a toddler, supported by their mother,
Takes their first steps on this street,
Embarking on life's journey, soaring high,
They will not forget the place where they learned to walk.
A kind mother once on this street,
Sent her son off to join the army with tears;
And also here with a joyful heart,
Welcomed her son home, wearing a hero's medal.
On this street live workers and scholars,
Their children study in schools.
Here you can only hear joyful songs,
The groans of pain have vanished with history.
In the twilight, it is brightly lit,
Even at night, darkness cannot be seen here,
Our street vibrates with songs,
The songs encourage people to move forward.
We once won the name Peace Street,
With heroic battles,
Children once shed blood,
Precious blood that will forever shine with golden light.
Golden light shoots out from tall rooftops,
Illuminating our wide street.
Our street name shines radiantly,
It symbolizes the wishes of the people of the motherland.
We hope that every town,
Will have a beautiful Peace Street,
Until the people's struggle is victorious,
We will use it to name the streets of the whole world.

    和平街
    蒙古　色·道尔吉帕拉木我们住在和平街的人，不希望从这里搬走，它是首都一条平常的街道，我们给它这样美丽的称号。这里虽没有高大的楼房，但在我心中多么亲切，散步在它平坦的马路上，清新的微风这般凉爽。当春阳从东方升起，古老的枞树、榆树枝叶闪亮，当黑眼睛的孩子背书包回家，我们的和平街更加风光。当学步的小孩挽着母亲，在这条街上跨出第一步，踏入生活的旅途，展翅飞腾，他忘不了他学会走路的地方。善良的母亲曾在这条街上，流着泪送儿子前去入伍；也曾在这里用欢乐的心情，迎接儿子归来，胸佩英雄章。在这条街上住着工人、学者，他们的孩子在学校里读书。这里你只能听到欢乐的歌声，痛苦呻吟已随着历史消逝。黄昏中，它灯火通明，夜晚在这里也看不到黑暗，我们的街道震荡在歌声中，歌声鼓舞人们向前迈进。我们曾用英勇的战斗，赢得和平街这一称号，孩子们曾经流过鲜血，宝贵的鲜血永闪金光。金光从高大屋顶上射出，照耀我们宽阔的街道。我们的街名光芒四射，它象征祖国人民的愿望。我们希望每一个城镇，都有一条美丽的和平街，等到人民斗争胜利后，要用它称呼全球的街道。
