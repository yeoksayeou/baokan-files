Xinhua News Agency, July 1st – The news that the Greek reactionaries have decided to send Manolis Glezos, the outstanding Greek political leader and peace fighter, to a military court for trial in early July has aroused strong anger among the public opinion and working people of socialist countries.

Glezos is the director of the Greek newspaper “Dawn” and was arrested by the Greek authorities in December 1958 on trumped-up charges.

In the German Democratic Republic, the German Committee for the Release of Glezos recently issued an appeal to the people of the country, asking them to loudly oppose the deliberate terrorist acts taken by the Greek reactionaries against Glezos. On June 27, the Executive Committee of the Free German Trade Union Federation sent a telegram to Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis, resolutely protesting the Greek authorities' conspiracy to submit Glezos to a military court for secret trial, and demanded that the Greek government immediately release Glezos.

The Central Council of Polish Trade Unions also sent a telegram to the Greek Prime Minister, expressing deep concern for the fate of Glezos, the glorious son of the Greek people, in the name of 5.5 million Polish trade union members, and calling for the immediate release of Glezos.

Working people and people's organizations from all walks of life in Czechoslovakia have sent telegrams to Greek King Paul and the Greek government, demanding the immediate release of Glezos. Fucikova, chairman of the Czechoslovak Committee for the Defense of Greek National Hero Glezos, recently appealed to the people of the country through broadcasting to do everything possible to rescue Glezos. She said that Glezos is not only fighting for the Greek people, but also a banner against fascism.

Romanian newspapers have recently published articles calling on all upright people to rise up to save Glezos' life. Professor Aslan, a well-known Romanian scholar, published an article in the "Spark" newspaper, demanding that the Greek authorities immediately release Glezos and other patriots.

Urban and rural working people in Albania have held rallies to protest the Greek government's conspiracy to submit Glezos to a military court for trial. They demanded the release of this Greek national hero.

The Mongolian "Truth Daily" published a commentary on June 28, saying that Glezos is a fighter for the freedom and independence of Greece, and the Mongolian people sympathize with and support him very much. Mongolian journalists expressed extreme anger and strong protest against the unreasonable behavior of the Greek reactionaries in deciding to have the military court try Glezos.

Xinhua News Agency, June 30th – According to a TASS report from Moscow on June 30th: The "Truth Daily" correspondent in Athens reported that the Greek people were greatly indignant after hearing the news that Glezos would be handed over to a military court in early July for trial on "espionage charges" in accordance with Law No. 375 passed during the fascist dictatorship, and they demanded the immediate release of this outstanding Greek political leader and peace fighter.

The reporter pointed out that the movement of Greek residents from all walks of life protesting against the persecution of Glezos by the Greek authorities is constantly expanding. Even among Greek bourgeois figures, many political leaders believe that the suppression of the masses and the persecution of progressive people should be stopped. The Liberal Party has submitted a proposal in the parliament to abolish Law No. 375, which has been supported by other opposition parties.
