The Soviet Achievements Shocked the United States
"Is this true?!"

(Based on reports from our newspaper) In recent days, the "Coliseum" building, the venue for the Soviet Science, Technology, and Culture Exhibition, has become the focus of attention in New York.

On the very day the exhibition opened, New York City was unusually sultry, with temperatures reaching 36 degrees Celsius. Radio broadcasts said, "The whole city sounds like a red-hot wok sizzling." Usually, in such weather, New York's squares, exhibition halls, and memorials are empty, with people staying indoors. But this day was different. Thousands of people flocked to the "Coliseum" building under the scorching sun, some with their families, others directly from their workplaces after work.

Inside the exhibition hall, people asked questions and discussed things enthusiastically, keeping the Soviet guides busy.

"What is the size and weight of the satellite?" someone asked. Before the guide could finish answering, a series of questions arose from the crowd.

"Do Soviet workers receive their salaries while on vacation?" After the guide answered affirmatively, people exclaimed in surprise, "Is this true?!"

A woman asked, "Free medical care, how is that possible?" After the guide patiently explained, people asked in astonishment, "Is this true?!" and then began a lively discussion.

Some people asked the guides, "Please talk about the Soviet children's summer camps"; others asked, "Does the Soviet Union still buy meat and sugar with ration coupons?" "Why is this radio called 'Novosibirsk'? Is it really made in Siberia?"... The guides answered each question, which invariably led to the astonished question, "Is this true?!" and heated discussions.

An employee of the Jacob Prylman store said to a guide in surprise: "So you also have film studios and your own film industry? But why do we rarely see your movies? In the past few years, I have only seen two of your films: 'The Forty-First' and 'The House I Live In'."

A housewife from the Bronx in New York, named Bellowood, visited the exhibition and, after learning about the current situation in the Soviet Union, sighed and said, "My father used to work with Russian immigrants on the railway. This was before the First World War. My father said that those Russians were good lads, but none of them knew Russian or English. Some of them were even afraid of cars and would make the sign of the cross when they saw one. Frankly, until recently, I still based my views of Russians on what my father said."

American Youth's Joy

A large proportion of the visitors to the Soviet exhibition were young people. The second floor was the most attractive to American youth, with models of artificial satellites and rockets, the latest Soviet passenger aircraft, and the "Lenin" atomic icebreaker. Many people—young students, engineers, and workers—came from other cities in the United States specifically to visit, not only wanting to touch these things but also wanting to deeply understand their structure and design drawings.

A medical student from Philadelphia named Udro stood still next to an electronic mathematical machine that analyzed human heart activity. Udro exclaimed: "Wonderful! I've never heard of such a machine. How was this ingenious machine made?"

Young worker Gary greatly admired an automatic gear cutting machine. He said, "It's made excellently, but how do you deal with unemployment?"

Fifteen-year-old music school student Alman Roan liked the "Estonia" grand piano so much that he couldn't bear to leave even late at night.

Meaningful Comments

American audiences gained a deep impression from the Soviet exhibition. Many people wrote enthusiastic words in the guestbook with excitement after the visit.

A woman from Pennsylvania wrote: "The whole exhibition satisfied me very much. Now I will look at your country with different eyes."

Someone named Stone wrote: "This is a most interesting exhibition, let there be more culture and no war!"

Engineer William Grigel wrote: "I am very surprised to see that Russia has made such great progress in only forty years. I hope that the great peoples of the United States and Russia will live in peace."

Someone with the signature "G. Le" wrote: "I salute you from Chicago. Your exhibition is great. It is a pity that I can only stay here for a few days. I wish your country prosperity and your success!"

A. Frum from the Bronx, New York, wrote: "I know that the Soviet Union has made great achievements in technology, but everything I saw here today surprised me. I didn't know you had come so far. I hope our two countries will be friendly and live in peace so that our people can share the fruits of great progress."

Air Giant Caused a Sensation

At 11:11 a.m. on June 28, the "Tu-114" turboprop passenger aircraft, carrying the First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Kozlov, to New York to attend the opening ceremony of the Soviet exhibition, arrived at New York International Airport after a non-stop flight. The famous New York International Airport was in a state of chaos. The plane landed. But the tallest escalator in the airport could not reach the door of the aircraft, still five feet away. For a time, the distinguished guests could not get off the plane. Finally, a small wooden ladder was thrown down from the plane, and airport personnel added it to the "big" escalator, which solved the problem.

Due to the interest caused by the "Tu-114" aircraft, the Soviet exhibition exhibited it as a temporary exhibit at New York International Airport for ten days from July 1, and rushed to make two tall escalators for visitors to use.

The world's largest Soviet "Tu-114" giant turboprop passenger aircraft caused a sensation after it was opened to the public in New York on July 1. In the first five days, 30,000 Americans rushed to see it.

This Soviet air giant caused a sensation in the West immediately after it arrived in New York directly from Moscow on June 28. After being officially opened to the public at Sabena Airlines airport in New York, it has actually become part of the Soviet Science, Technology, and Culture Exhibition held in New York, and like countless other outstanding exhibits, has become the focus of interest and praise of the American public.

Every day, from morning to night, people from New York and other American cities come in an endless stream, and more and more, many of the audience are "the whole family".

In particular, American pilots and airline personnel are particularly interested in the "Tu-114". They came in rows and teams to visit, scrambling to see the cockpit, control instruments... Whether it was the size of the "Tu-114", the perfection of the driving instruments, or the comfort of the seats, these expert aviation personnel were greatly surprised.

A driver from American "Eastern Airlines" said that its cabin is almost three times that of our planes here, and the engine power is several times stronger, and our planes cannot fly so high or so far. Aviation personnel unanimously said that they had not seen any country with such an aircraft. (Attached picture)

    苏联成就震惊了美国
   “这是真的呀？！”
    本报综合报道　这些天，苏联科学、技术和文化成就展览会的展出地点“科洛西姆”大楼成为全纽约受注目的中心。
    就在展览会开幕的那一天，纽约市异常闷热，气温达到三十六度，无线电广播说：“全市好像一个烧红了的炒锅吱吱发响”。通常在这样的天气里，纽约的广场、展览馆、纪念馆都是空空如也，人们都躲在家里不出来。这一天可就不同了，有成千上万的人在烈日下拥向“科洛西姆”大楼，有的是全家来的，也有的是整个工作组下了班直接跑来的。
    在展览馆里，人们问长问短，热烈议论，苏联解说员应接不暇。
      “卫星有多大尺寸，多重？”一个人问道；解说员还没答完，人群里又发出了一连串的问题。
    “苏联工人休假，工薪照发吗？”解说员肯定地回答之后，人们都惊奇地发问“这是真的呀？！”
    一个女人问道：“免费医疗，这怎么可能呢？”解说员耐心地解释了这个问题，人们惊问
  “这是真的呀？！”于是又热烈地议论起来。
    有的人要求解说员，“请谈一谈苏联儿童夏令营的情况”；有的人问，“苏联现在还是凭配给证买肉和糖吗？”“为什么这个收音机叫‘新西伯利亚’牌的，难道真是在西伯利亚做的吗？”……解说员一一作答，而照例引起的是“这是真的呀？！”的惊问和热烈的议论。
    雅可布·普里曼商店的一个工作人员对解说员惊奇地说：“原来你们也有电影制片厂，也有自己的电影工业呀？可是为什么我们很少看到你们的电影呢？这好几年来我只看到过你们两部片子：‘第四十一’和‘我住的房子’”。
    纽约布朗克斯区的一个名叫白劳伍的家庭妇女参观了展览会，了解了苏联今天的情况以后感叹地说：“我的父亲过去在铁路上同俄国侨民一起工作过。这还是第一次世界大战以前的事。父亲说过，那些俄国人都是好小伙子，可是他们没有一个人认识俄文或英文。他们有些人还怕汽车，见了汽车就划十字。坦白地说，我在不久以前还是根据父亲的这些话来看俄国人的。”
        美国青年的喜悦
    苏联展览会的观众，有很大一部分是青年。最吸引美国青年的是二楼，在那里有人造卫星和火箭的模型，有苏联最新式客机和“列宁”号原子破冰船的模型等。有许多人——青年学生、工程师、工人特地从美国其他城市赶来参观，他们不仅想亲手摸一摸这些东西，而且还想深入了解这些东西的构造和设计图样。
    从费城来的一个名叫乌得罗学医的大学生，站在一架分析人的心脏活动情况的电子数学机器旁走不动了。乌得罗赞叹道：“太妙了！像这样的机器我从来没听说过。这种巧妙的机器是怎么制成的？”
    青年工人加里非常欣赏一台自动切齿机。他说：“做得很出色，可是你们怎样对待失业现象呢？”
    十五岁的音乐学校的学生阿尔曼·罗安是这样喜欢“爱沙尼亚”牌的三角钢琴，以至到夜深了还舍不得离开。
        意重情深的评语
    美国观众从苏联展览会上获得了深刻的印象。许多人参观后以激动的心情在留言簿上写下了热情的话。
    宾夕法尼亚州的一个妇女写道：“整个展览会使我感到十分满意。现在我要用另外的眼光来看你们的国家。”
    一个名叫斯汤恩的写道：“这是一个最有趣的展览会，让文化更多些，不要战争！”
    工程师威廉·格里盖尔写道：“我看到俄国仅在四十年间就获得如此巨大的进步，十分惊奇。希望美国和俄国两国伟大的人民和平相处。”
    一个署名“格·勒”的人写道：“我从芝加哥向你们致敬。你们的展览会太好了。遗憾的是我只能在这里停留数日。祝贵国富强，祝你们成功！”
    纽约布朗克斯区的阿·弗朗姆写道：“我知道苏联在技术方面取得了很大的成就，可是今天在这里看到的一切使我很惊讶。我还不知道你们原来走了那么远了。希望我们两国友好、和平相处，以便我们的人民能够分享伟大进步的果实。”
        空中巨人轰动一时
  6月28日上午十一时十一分，载着苏联部长会议第一副主席科兹洛夫前来纽约参加苏联展览会开幕式的“图—114”涡轮喷气式客机，以不着陆的飞行到达纽约国际机场。著名的纽约国际机场出现了一片忙乱的景象。飞机着陆了。可是机场里最高大的扶梯都达不到飞机的舱门，相距还有五呎。贵宾们一时竟无法走下飞机。最后，从飞机上丢下来一个小的木扶梯，机场人员把它加放在“大”扶梯上面，这样才算解决了问题。
    由于“图—114”飞机所引起的兴趣，苏联展览会把它作为临时展览品，从7月1日起在纽约国际机场展出十天，并且赶制了两架高大的扶梯以供参观者使用。
    世界上最大的苏联“图—114”巨型涡轮喷气式客机7月1日在纽约开放参观后轰动一时，头五天内即有三万美国人前往争先观看。
    这一苏联空中巨人6月28日，从莫斯科直达纽约后，立刻引起西方的轰动。在纽约萨比那航空公司的机场上正式向观众开放后，它实际上已成为在纽约举行的苏联科学、技术和文化成就展览会中的一部分，而且和其他无数出色的展品一样，成了美国公众最感兴趣和赞扬的中心。
    每天从早到晚来自纽约和其他一些美国城市的人流，络绎不绝，而且越来越多，观众中有很多都是
  “合府光临”。
    特别是美国的飞行员和各航空公司的人员对“图—114”产生了特别的兴趣，他们整排整队地前来参观，争先恐后地要求看驾驶室、操纵仪器……无论是“图—114”的大小、驾驶仪器的完善、或者座位的舒适，都使这些内行的航空人员们大吃一惊。
    美国“东方航空公司”的一个驾驶员说，它的座舱差不多为我们这里的飞机三倍，发动机的力量也要强好几倍，而且，我们的飞机不可能飞得这样高、这样远。航空人员们一致表示说，他们还没有见任何一个国家有这样的飞机。（附图片）
