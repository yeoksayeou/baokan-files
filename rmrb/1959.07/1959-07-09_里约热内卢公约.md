    "Rio de Janeiro Treaty"

    U.S. imperialism is currently using the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the national revolutionary movements of Cuba and other Latin American countries. At the recent meeting of the organization's council, it attempted to invoke the "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance" (or "Rio de Janeiro Treaty"), signed at the Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Continental Peace and Security held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August-September 1947, to achieve its purpose of interference.
      The "Rio de Janeiro Treaty" is one of a series of treaties adopted by the "Organization of American States" to facilitate U.S. military and political interference and control over Latin American countries. This treaty stipulates that "an armed attack by any state against an American state shall be considered an attack against all American states," and that each country may "defend itself individually or collectively"; even so-called "non-armed attack of aggression" or other "threats," countries must take measures of "collective defense." The treaty also stipulates the so-called "security zone" for implementing "collective defense," with an area of more than 100 million square kilometers, which not only includes the United States and the entire Latin America, but also extends to Canada, Greenland, the Antarctic region, the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean.
    According to these provisions, the United States can arbitrarily fabricate a so-called "aggression" or "threat," and drive Latin American countries to carry out military intervention on behalf of the United States and suppress the national revolutionary movements in Latin America. Moreover, when the United States wages war outside the Latin American region, it can also force Latin American countries to provide cannon fodder and drag them into the disaster of war.
    In Latin America, apart from U.S. aggression and interference, there is no other "aggression" or "threat." The "aggression" and "threat" stipulated in the treaty refer to the national revolutionary movements in Latin American countries. Now, the United States is instructing the dictatorial regimes of Dominica and Nicaragua to fabricate the excuse of Cuba's so-called "invasion" at the "Organization of American States" Council meeting, in order to invoke the "Rio de Janeiro Treaty" and force other member states to accept the U.S. plan to interfere in Cuba.

### “里约热内卢公约”

    “里约热内卢公约”
    美帝国主义目前正在利用“美洲国家组织”干涉古巴和其他拉丁美洲国家的民族革命运动。它在最近召开的这个组织理事会会议上，企图援用1947年8月—9月于巴西首都里约热内卢召开的美洲国家“和平与安全会议”签订的“西半球防御条约”（或称“里约热内卢公约”），以达到其干涉的目的。
      “里约热内卢公约”是“美洲国家组织”通过的一系列便利美国在军事上政治上干涉和控制拉丁美洲国家的条约之一。这个条约规定
  “任何国家对一个美洲国家之武装攻击，应认为是对全体美洲国家的攻击”，各国得“单独或集体自卫”；即使是所谓“非武装攻击之侵略”，或其他“威胁”，各国也要采取“共同防御”的措施。条约还规定了实行“共同防御”的所谓“安全地区”，其面积有一亿多平方公里，不仅包括美国和整个拉丁美洲，而且还扩大到加拿大、格陵兰、南极地带、北冰洋、大西洋和太平洋。
    根据这些规定，美国就可以随意制造一个所谓“侵略”或“威胁”，驱使拉丁美洲国家替美国进行军事干涉，镇压拉丁美洲的民族革命运动。而且，美国在拉丁美洲地区以外进行战争时也可以迫使拉丁美洲国家提供炮灰，把它们拖到战争灾难中去。
    在拉丁美洲，除了美国的侵略和干涉以外，并不存在别的“侵略”和“威胁”。条约所规定的“侵略”和“威胁”，是指拉丁美洲国家的民族革命运动。现在，美国就在指使多米尼加和尼加拉瓜独裁政权在
  “美洲国家组织”理事会会议上制造所谓古巴“入侵”的借口，以便援用“里约热内卢公约”，强迫其他成员国接受美国干涉古巴的计划。
