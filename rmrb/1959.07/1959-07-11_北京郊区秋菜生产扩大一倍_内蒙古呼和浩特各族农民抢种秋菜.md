Xinhua News Agency report: People's communes and state-owned farms in the suburbs of Beijing are seizing the opportunity to make early arrangements for autumn vegetable production. The planned sowing area for autumn commercial vegetables in the entire suburban area this year is 390,000 mu, more than double that of last year.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China made arrangements for vegetable production for the whole year as early as this spring, and recently convened a meeting of secretaries of districts and county committees in charge of vegetable production to make specific deployments for autumn production.

Beijing's commercial departments have prepared a large amount of chemical fertilizer for autumn Chinese cabbage production in the suburbs, and are currently preparing pesticides and reeds, glass, and reed mats needed for the development of greenhouses and sunken greenhouses. Many communes are actively accumulating and producing fertilizer to prepare base fertilizer for autumn vegetables. Haidian District has organized manpower from the Si Ji Qing, Dong Sheng, Haidian, and Yong Feng communes to process granular fertilizer with peat and chemical fertilizer, and plans to rush to produce 3 million jin within the next month as base fertilizer for autumn Chinese cabbage.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot report: Commune members of all nationalities in the near suburbs of Hohhot are rushing to plant autumn vegetables.

Due to the cold climate in Hohhot, the vegetable growing season is only more than five months. Every year for nine to ten months, vegetable supply mainly relies on stored autumn vegetables. In order to ensure that the city's 500,000 people can eat vegetables every day in both the off-season and the peak season, the four people's communes in the near suburbs of the city have decided to focus on vegetable production, expand the replanting area of ​​vegetables, and sow 49,000 mu of autumn vegetables. The people's communes have now sown 26,600 mu of autumn vegetables.

In order to lead the autumn vegetable sowing work well, the leading cadres of the Hohhot Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the suburban district party and government leading departments, and the commercial departments have recently frequently gone to the people's communes to help solve problems in a timely manner. The people's communes and larger collective catering units in the near suburbs, as well as vegetable supply departments, have all made advance arrangements for autumn vegetable storage. Commercial departments are now trying to solve the problem of materials needed to build vegetable cellars.

    北京郊区秋菜生产扩大一倍
    内蒙古呼和浩特各族农民抢种秋菜
    据新华社讯　北京市郊区人民公社和国营农场，抓紧时机及早安排秋季蔬菜生产。全郊区今年计划把秋季商品蔬菜的播种面积扩大到三十九万亩，比去年增加一倍多。
    中共北京市委早在今年春天就对蔬菜生产进行了全年生产与供应的安排，最近又召开了各区、县委主管蔬菜生产的书记会议对秋季生产作了具体部署。
    北京市商业部门已经为郊区秋季大白菜生产准备了大量化学肥料，目前正在准备农药和发展温室、阳畦所需要的蒲席、玻璃、苇子等。许多公社正积极积肥造肥，为秋菜准备底肥。海淀区已经组织四季青、东升、海淀、永丰等公社的人力，用草炭和化肥加工制造颗粒肥料，计划在最近一月之内赶制三百万斤，做秋季大白菜的底肥。
    据新华社呼和浩特讯　呼和浩特市近郊各人民公社各族社员，正在抢种秋菜。
    呼和浩特市由于气候寒冷，蔬菜生长期只有五个多月，每年有九个月到十个月的蔬菜，主要依靠储存的秋菜来供应。全市近郊区的四个人民公社，为了保证全市五十万人口，在淡季和旺季每人每天都能吃到蔬菜，决定以蔬菜生产为主，扩大蔬菜复种面积，播种秋菜四万九千亩。各人民公社现在已播种秋菜二万六千六百亩。
    为了领导好秋菜播种工作，中共呼和浩特市委、郊区党政领导部门和商业部门的领导干部，最近经常到各人民公社，及时帮助解决问题。近郊各人民公社和较大的集体伙食单位，以及蔬菜供应部门，都提前安排了秋菜储存工作。商业部门现正多方设法解决修筑菜窖所需的材料。
