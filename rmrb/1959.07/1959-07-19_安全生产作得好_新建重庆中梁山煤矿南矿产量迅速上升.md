Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 17th: The Chongqing Zhongliangshan Coal Mine South Mine has done a good job in safe production, ensuring a rapid increase in coal output. In the second quarter of this year, the mine's raw coal output increased by 57.89% compared to the first quarter.
    The Zhongliangshan South Mine is a super-gassy mine that was put into production in January of this year. Workers can see the water in the ditches boiling due to underground gas; where there are cracks on the surface of the vertical shaft, a match can ignite flames more than one meter high. In addition, most of the miners here are new workers, making safe production very difficult.
    In response to the characteristics of this mine, the general Party branch of the Zhongliangshan South Mine resolutely adopted the approach of grasping safety production tightly from the beginning and throughout the entire process. Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels in the mine have selected safety committee members. The administrative department has established a safety supervision section, each mining area is equipped with a safety area chief, and each shift and team also has a safety team leader and a safety officer. These people come from the masses and live with the masses, enabling them to discover and solve unsafe production problems in a timely manner. In addition, gas research groups, mine rescue teams, dust prevention teams, sealing teams, and gas drilling teams have been established among the employees, extensively absorbing the masses to participate in safety work.
    In the process of grasping safety production, the mine's leading cadres, based on the laws of past accidents, focused on night shifts, shift changes, rest shifts, Saturday evenings and Sundays, and the last four hours of each shift. Leading cadres are on duty at the mine at all times, and district and team leaders take turns on duty like the workers. While "grasping the five key points," the mine has also established and improved some necessary rules and regulations, such as the post responsibility system, gas inspection system, ventilation management system, fire prevention inspection system, engineering specification quality acceptance system, and mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance system.
    To ensure safe production, the mine leaders also mobilized old workers to carry out "four teachings" (i.e., teaching ideology, teaching production technology, teaching safety production, and teaching life), and held technical training classes to give new workers safety lessons, enabling them to master the laws of gas changes and methods to prevent accidents.

### 安全生产作得好  新建重庆中梁山煤矿南矿产量迅速上升

    安全生产作得好
    新建重庆中梁山煤矿南矿产量迅速上升
    新华社重庆17日电　重庆中梁山煤矿南矿安全生产作得好，保证了煤炭产量迅速上升。今年第二季度这个矿的原煤产量比第一季度增长了57.89％。
    中梁山南矿是今年1月份投入生产的超级瓦斯矿。工人们在井下生产，可以看到水沟里的流水被地下瓦斯烧得沸腾起来；在竖井地面上有裂缝的地方，用火柴一点，就冒起一米多高的火苗。加上这里的矿工，绝大部分都是新工人，要做到安全生产是很不容易的。
    中共中梁山南矿党总支针对这个矿的特点，对于安全生产坚决采取了一开头就抓紧，自始至终抓紧的做法。矿上党、政、工、团各级组织都选出了安全委员，行政部门设立了安全监察科，各采煤区配备有安全区长，各班、组也分别设有安全班长和安全员。这些人来自群众，又同群众经常生活在一起，能及时发现和解决生产上不安全的问题。此外，在职工中也成立了瓦斯研究组，矿山救护队，防尘队，密闭队，瓦斯钻探队等组织，广泛地吸收群众参加安全工作。
    矿的领导干部在抓安全生产的过程中，根据过去发生事故的规律，重点地抓夜班、转班、休班、星期六晚上和星期天，以及每班生产的后四小时。矿里随时都有领导干部值班，区、班长都和工人一样轮流值班。在“五抓”的同时，矿里还建立和健全了一些必要的规章制度，如岗位责任制，瓦斯检查制，通风管理制，防火检查制，工程规格质量验收制，机电设备维修制等等。
    为了保证安全生产，矿领导方面还发动老工人进行“四教”（即教思想、教生产技术、教安全生产、教生活），开办技术训练班给新工人上安全课，使新工人掌握瓦斯变化规律和防止事故的办法。
