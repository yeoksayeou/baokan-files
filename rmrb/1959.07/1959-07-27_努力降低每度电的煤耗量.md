Reducing coal consumption in the power industry is an important aspect of conserving coal. According to the coal allocation plan, the country's thermal power plants consume approximately 12% of the nation's total coal production annually, accounting for about 50% of the total power generation cost. Therefore, vigorously reducing coal consumption per kilowatt-hour in thermal power plants is of great significance for both saving coal and reducing power generation costs.

Perhaps some people have the view that coal consumption in thermal power generation has been continuously reduced in recent years, and there isn't much "fat" left to squeeze out by saving more coal. Some also believe that a little coal wastage in power plants is unavoidable. The experience of Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant and many other power plants across the country proves that this view is incorrect. The road to saving coal in thermal power plants has not yet reached its end and the potential remains enormous; waste is not inevitable, but can be avoided. First of all, there is still great potential in reducing heat loss and improving thermal efficiency. Not only do thermal efficiencies vary between many power plants with the same conditions nationwide, but even within the same power plant and the same generating unit, the efficiency varies at different times. Some plants and units with good technical conditions even have lower thermal efficiency than those with poor technical conditions. If we can find ways to reduce heat loss, burn less coal, and maximize its effectiveness, we can greatly reduce coal consumption. Secondly, there is still much work to be done in improving operations. Often, power plants with the same conditions and generating units with the same conditions have varying coal consumption due to differences in advanced and backward operating methods. Some advanced operating methods result in a flue gas temperature of around 120 degrees Celsius, while some flawed operating methods result in a flue gas temperature as high as 160 or 170 degrees Celsius. Reducing the flue gas temperature by 10 degrees Celsius can increase boiler combustion efficiency by about 0.5%, significantly reducing coal consumption. Thirdly, there are also many avenues for saving coal through equipment improvements. For example, some coal feeders easily cause coal powder to flow freely, causing large amounts of coal powder to escape from the chimney without being burned. Simply improving the equipment slightly can basically eliminate this phenomenon. Other equipment defects, such as steam leaks, water leaks, malfunctioning boiler sootblowers, and excessive scale in water pipes, can all be improved to reduce coal consumption. Fourthly, in terms of coal storage and transportation, if all power plants across the country sweep each coal car clean, they can reduce losses by thousands of tons of coal annually. If all power plants across the country fully tap their potential in all aspects, reducing the coal consumption index by just 20 grams per kilowatt-hour could save hundreds of thousands of tons of coal annually.

There is no doubt that the potential for saving coal in thermal power generation exists. However, to unlock this potential, a series of concrete measures must be taken. The most important measure is that the Party organizations of each thermal power plant must fully mobilize the masses, launch a mass movement to save coal, brainstorm ideas around the key to saving coal throughout the plant, find tricks, and propose various innovative measures and rationalization proposals. Leaders should promptly organize technical personnel and veteran workers to study how to implement these suggestions and promote them, so that they can blossom and bear fruit as soon as possible. Facts have proven that factories that have done this have achieved great success in saving coal. Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant launched a mass movement to save coal, and the workers carried out competitions on small indicators (the ratio of combustibles in ash, flue gas temperature, etc.) and "four no leaks" (no steam leaks, no water leaks, no air leaks, and no heat leaks), putting forward a large number of innovative suggestions. The factory leadership summarized and promoted practical suggestions, reduced combustibles in ash and flue gas temperature, and improved boiler thermal efficiency, saving more than 7,400 tons of coal in the first half of this year alone. If all power plants across the country did this, coal consumption could definitely be further reduced.

To achieve the goal of reducing coal consumption per kilowatt-hour, it is also necessary to strive to improve enterprise management. Based on Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant's experience in saving coal, the following aspects should be focused on: First, strengthen quota management and analysis of various economic indicators such as coal consumption and thermal efficiency. In order to better save coal, it is necessary to implement coal consumption quota management and stipulate various indicators such as thermal efficiency. Enterprise leaders and the vast number of employees must regularly conduct economic activity analysis, put forward improvement opinions based on problems in production, and clarify the direction of coal saving. This is an important measure to improve unit efficiency and reduce coal consumption. Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant has established economic activity analysis from the factory and branch level to the team level. An analysis is conducted after each shift to find out the reasons for high coal consumption and improve them in a timely manner; the branch conducts an analysis once a day, and the factory conducts an analysis once a week to formulate improvement measures in a timely manner, which has played a great role in saving coal. Second, summarize and promote advanced experience in a timely manner. In power plants, various economic and technical indicators are not isolated, but often restrict and influence each other, so it is necessary to have skilled operating techniques. The factory leadership should constantly summarize the workers' operating techniques and improve their operating level. Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant implemented a three-way combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and veteran workers, held technical research meetings, and summarized the "five stable" operating method (stable adjustment of coal supply baffle, stable outlet temperature of coal mill, stable air pressure of pulverized coal system, stable speed of coal powder supply, and stable adjustment of air damper), which improved the workers' operating level and played a great role in reducing coal consumption. Third, improve equipment and strengthen equipment maintenance. Carry out timely maintenance for water leaks, steam leaks, air leaks, excessive scale, etc., increase the heating surface, and improve thermal efficiency. In addition, the transportation, storage, and coal delivery of coal should also be improved to reduce losses. This measure is especially important during the current rainy season. In addition, burning low-value coal to generate electricity and save good coal is also one of the main technical policies of the power industry. Over the past few years, power industry workers have achieved great success and accumulated a lot of experience in burning low-value coal. The proportion of mixed low-value coal burned annually has reached more than 25%. Under the current coal supply situation, burning a large amount of low-value coal is even more important. The national power industry workers should make persistent efforts, and strive to burn as much low-value coal as possible under the condition of ensuring safety and power supply!

In order to realize various coal-saving measures, it is also necessary to strengthen cooperation between various departments within the power plant. To save coal in a power plant, it is not enough to rely on just one department. For example, if the fuel management department does not mix coal evenly, it will also affect the boiler's combustion and increase coal consumption; if the maintenance department does not repair the equipment in a timely manner, it will reduce the economic performance of the equipment, which will also increase coal consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation and mutual support between various departments and work together to reduce coal consumption. After Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant changed the past phenomenon of uncoordinated relations and mutual complaints between various departments, the various departments jointly assisted the boiler branch, the key unit for saving coal, in reducing coal consumption, and immediate results were achieved.

While vigorously carrying out the coal-saving movement, we must not relax our attention to safety issues for a moment. Coal-saving work should be based on ensuring safe power generation. If one-sided emphasis on coal-saving violates safety principles and accidents occur, it violates the principle of saving and causes huge waste to the country.

Reducing coal consumption and saving coal is a glorious task for the vast number of workers on the national power industry front. Recently, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power Industry has put forward the target of saving coal in thermal power generation nationwide, requiring thermal power plants across the country to save 2.5% of coal in the second half of the year based on the actual coal consumption in the first half of the year. The vast number of workers in thermal power plants across the country are responding to this call, taking various measures to continue to reduce coal consumption. We wish the national power industry workers to complete and over fulfill this target, and make greater contributions to national construction in saving coal!

    努力降低每度电的煤耗量
    节约电力工业用煤，是节约煤炭的一个重要方面。根据煤炭的分配计划，全国火力发电厂全年用煤量占全国煤炭总产量的12％左右，占发电总成本的50％左右。因此，在火力发电厂中大力降低每度电的煤耗量，对于节约煤炭和降低发电成本，都有很重要的意义。
    也许有人有这样的看法：几年来火力发电的煤耗量不断降低，再节约煤炭怕没有什么油水了。有人也有这种看法：发电厂浪费点煤总是难免的。天津第一发电厂和全国许多发电厂的经验证明，这种看法是不正确的。火力发电厂节约用煤，并未到头，道路还是异常广阔；浪费不是不可避免，而是可以避免的。首先，在减少热损失，提高热效率方面，潜力还是很大的。不仅全国许多条件相同的电厂之间热效率有高有低，就是同一个电厂、同一台机炉，在不同时间内，效率也有高有低，甚至有些技术条件好的厂和机炉，还不如技术条件差的厂和机炉热效率高。如能设法减少热损失，使煤烧得少，发挥的作用大，就可以大大减少耗煤量。其次，在改进操作方面，也还有许多工作可做。往往条件相同的电厂，条件相同的机炉，由于操作方法有先进和落后之分，也影响煤耗量有高有低。有的操作方法先进，排烟温度为一百二十度左右，有的操作方法有缺点，排烟温度高达一百六、七十度；而排烟温度降低十度，锅炉燃烧效率就可以提高0.5％左右，煤耗就可显著降低。第三，在改进设备方面，节约煤的门路也多，如有的给粉机，煤粉容易自流；使大量煤粉未经燃烧就从烟囱里跑掉，只要将设备稍加改进，就可基本上消灭这种现象。其他如设备漏汽、漏水，锅炉吹灰器不灵，水管水垢过多等等设备上的缺陷，只要加以改进，都可以降低煤耗量。第四，在煤炭的保管、运输方面，只要全国各电厂把每个煤车扫干净，全年就可以少损耗上千吨煤炭。如果全国各电厂从各个方面充分挖掘潜力，每度电的煤耗指标只要下降二十克，全年就可节约数十万吨煤炭。
    火力发电节约用煤的潜力无疑是存在的。但是，要把这种潜力挖掘出来，则需要采取一系列的具体措施。最主要的措施是各火力发电厂的党组织要充分发动群众，展开一个群众性的节约用煤运动，围绕全厂节约用煤的关键想办法，找窍门，提出各种革新措施和合理化建议。领导上要及时组织技术人员、老工人，研究如何实现这些建议推广这些建议，让它们早日开花结果。事实证明，凡是这样作了的工厂，节约用煤成绩就很大。天津发电一厂开展群众性的节约用煤运动，职工们围绕节约用煤问题展开小指标（灰中可燃物的比率、排烟温度等）竞赛和“四不漏”（不漏汽、不漏水、不漏风、不漏热），提出了大量的革新建议。工厂领导方面总结、推广了切实可行的建议，降低了灰中可燃物和排烟温度，提高了锅炉热效率，今年上半年就节约用煤七千四百多吨。如果全国各电厂都这样作，煤耗量就一定可以进一步降低。
    要达到降低每度电的煤耗量，还必须努力改进企业管理。从天津第一发电厂节约用煤的经验来看，应当抓紧这几个环节：第一，加强定额管理，加强对煤耗、热效率等各项经济指标的分析工作。为了更好地节约用煤，必须实行燃煤定额管理，规定热效率等各项指标。企业的领导者和广大职工，要经常进行经济活动分析，根据生产中的问题，提出改进意见，明确节约用煤方向，这是提高机组效率、降低煤耗的一项重要措施。天津第一发电厂建立了从工厂、分场到班的经济活动分析，每班下班后分析一次，找出煤耗高的原因，及时加以改进；分场每日分析一次，工厂每周分析一次，及时制定改进措施，对节约用煤发挥很大作用。第二，及时总结和推广先进经验。在发电厂中，各项经济技术指标都不是孤立的，往往互相制约，互相影响，因此必须要有熟练的操作技术。工厂的领导方面，应该不断地总结工人的操作技术，提高工人的操作水平。天津发电一厂，实行领导干部、技术人员、老工人三结合的办法，举行技术研究会，总结出了“五稳”操作法（调整给煤档板稳、磨煤机出口温度稳，制粉系统风压稳、给煤粉速度稳和调整风门稳），提高了工人的操作水平，对降低煤耗起了很大作用。第三，改进设备，加强设备维修工作。对漏水、漏汽、漏风、水垢过多等情况及时进行检修，加大受热面，提高热效率。此外还应当改进煤炭的运输、保管、送煤等工作，以减少损耗。目前正值雨季，这一措施尤其重要。另外燃用低值煤发电，节省好煤。这也是电力工业的主要技术政策之一，几年以来，电力工业职工在烧用低值煤方面已经取得很大的成绩，积累了不少经验。每年掺烧低值煤的比重已达25％以上。在目前煤炭供应的情况下，大量烧用低值煤，更有重要的意义。全国电力工业职工，应该再接再厉，在保证安全与电力供应的条件下，为尽量多烧低值煤而努力！
    为了实现各项节约用煤措施，还需要加强电厂内部各部门之间的协作。在发电厂中，要节约用煤，单靠某一个部门都是不够的，比如燃料管理部门如果混煤的比例不均匀，同样也会影响锅炉的燃烧，增加煤耗；检修部门不及时检修设备，就会减低设备的经济性能，同样会增加煤耗。因此，必须加强各部门之间的协作配合，互相支援，共同为降低煤耗而努力。天津第一发电厂改变了过去各部门之间关系不协调的现象和互相埋怨的现象以后，各部门共同协助节约用煤的关键单位——锅炉分场降低煤耗，就立竿见影地收到了实效。
    在大力开展节约用煤运动的同时，一刻也不能放松对安全问题的注意，应该是把节约用煤工作建立在保证安全发电的基础上，如果片面强调节约用煤违反了安全原则，发生了事故，也就违反了节约原则，反而给国家造成巨大的浪费。
    降低煤耗，节约煤炭，是全国电力工业战线上广大职工的一项光荣任务。最近，水利电力工业部已提出全国火力发电方面节约用煤的指标，要求全国火力发电厂在上半年实际耗煤量的基础上，下半年节约用煤2.5％。全国火力发电厂的广大职工，现正纷纷响应这个号召，采取各种措施，继续降低煤耗。我们预祝全国电力工业职工完成和超额完成这个指标，在节约煤炭中为国家建设作出更大的贡献！
