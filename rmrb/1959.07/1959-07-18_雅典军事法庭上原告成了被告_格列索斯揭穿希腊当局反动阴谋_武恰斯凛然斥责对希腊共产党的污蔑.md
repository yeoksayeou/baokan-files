Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 17th (TASS dispatch from Athens, July 16th): The Athens Military Tribunal continued its trial of Glezos and other defendants on the 16th. Glezos, in his statement during the evening session, forcefully and convincingly exposed and refuted the false accusations of so-called "espionage activities" against him. The measures taken by the police to prevent representatives of the Greek public from attending the hearing and to obstruct the work of foreign journalists demonstrated the extreme panic of the Greek authorities.

Glezos said that the police insisted that he had met with Kolyannis on August 16th, while in fact he was at the cinema with his wife and son. The next day, according to the police, he continued to hold "secret meetings" with Kolyerchis, while the fact was that he was resting in Rafina with his family. Glezos refuted all the fabrications of the police about his "secret activities," saying that all his activities were known to the United Democratic Left party of Greece and were carried out with the party's consent. Glezos pointed out that he knew the secret police had been following him.

Glezos emphasized that the Greek authorities had long hated him to the bone. He said that the persecution against him was only part of the reactionary forces' general offensive against the democratic forces in Greece. He pointed out that Papaspyropoulos and Sakellariou, who served as witnesses for the prosecution in court, had accused the "Dawn Daily." Glezos described to the court the police persecution and economic pressure against the "Dawn Daily." Some reporters of this newspaper were arrested.

He then said that the left-wing movement in Greece is rising day by day, and the authorities know that I am unwavering and that I am listening to the beating of the people's hearts. The purpose of accusing me is to blame the United Democratic Left and obstruct cooperation between opposition parties. Someone attempted to achieve a political goal by arresting me—not only to eliminate me personally but also to strike at the United Democratic Left. However, the party cannot be eliminated.

Glezos continued that many political forces in the country hope to normalize the situation in Greece, and no force can stop this. He expressed his firm belief that the country will become an independent country and will contribute to the consolidation of peace, which is exactly what the Greek people demand.

The defendant Voutchas spoke at the military tribunal on the same day, resolutely protesting against the attempt to portray the Greek Communist Party as an espionage organization. The presiding judge attempted to prevent Voutchas from speaking, on the pretext that his speech was political in nature and irrelevant to the substance of the case. After a firm protest from the defense lawyer, the court president was forced to allow Voutchas to speak. In his speech, the defendant exposed the political nature of the current trial and described the patriotic activities of the Greek Communist Party over the past forty years and its tireless struggle for the interests of the Greek people.

Voutchas said: "I am supremely honored to belong to the Greek Communist Party and am prepared to dedicate all my strength and my entire life to the Party, to Greece, and to the people."

During the trial on the evening of the 15th, Glezos's sister, Vasiliki, and her husband, Doriani Tou, presented testimony. They cited specific facts to refute the false accusations of Glezos's "espionage activities" and described in detail how the political police bureau began fabricating the so-called "Glezos case" since October 1958. The trial is continuing.

    雅典军事法庭上原告成了被告
    格列索斯揭穿希腊当局反动阴谋
    武恰斯凛然斥责对希腊共产党的污蔑
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社雅典16日讯：雅典军事法庭16日继续审讯格列索斯和其他被告。格列索斯在晚间开庭时发言，有力而令人信服地揭露和驳斥了对他的进行所谓“间谍活动”的诬告。警察采取措施不让希腊公众代表旁听，并且阻挠外国记者的工作，这些措施说明希腊当局极其恐慌。
    格列索斯说，警察硬说他曾在8月16日同科里雅尼斯会面，而其实他那时正同自己的妻子和儿子在电影院里看电影。第二天，据警察说，他继续同科利尔奇斯开“秘密会议”，而事实是他同自己的亲人在腊菲纳休息。格列索斯驳斥了警察关于他进行“秘密活动”的全部捏造，他说，他的全部活动希腊统一民主左翼党都知道，并且是取得党的同意的。格列索斯指出，他知道秘密警察一直在跟踪他。
    格列索斯着重指出，希腊当局早就对他恨之入骨。他说，对他所进行的迫害只是反动派对希腊民主力量的总进攻的一部分。他指出，在法庭上作为原告证人的帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯和萨凯拉里乌曾经控诉过“黎明日报”。格列索斯对法庭叙述了对“黎明日报”进行警察迫害和施加经济压力的情况。这家报纸一些记者遭到逮捕。
    他接着说，希腊的左翼运动日益高涨，当局知道我是坚定不移的，我在倾听人民心脏的跳动。控告我的目的是要责难统一民主左翼党和阻挠反对党之间的合作。有人企图用逮捕我的手段来达到政治目的——不仅消灭我个人，而且要打击统一民主左翼党。然而党是不可能被消灭的。
    格列索斯接着说，国内许多政治力量希望希腊局势正常化，这是什么力量也阻挠不了的。他表示深信，国家将成为独立的国家，将对巩固和平作出贡献，而这正是希腊人民的要求。
    被告人武恰斯同一天在军事法庭上发言，坚决抗议企图把希腊共产党说成是间谍组织。庭长企图禁止武恰斯发言，借口说他的发言属于政治性质和与案件实质无关。法庭庭长在受到辩护人的坚决抗议之后，又被迫准许武恰斯发言。被告人在自己的发言中揭露了目前审讯的政治性质并且叙述了希腊共产党四十年来的爱国活动，以及它为希腊人民的利益所进行的不倦的斗争。
    武恰斯说：“我以属于希腊共产党引为无上光荣，并准备把自己全部力量、整个生命献给党、献给希腊和人民。”
    在15日晚上的审讯中，格列索斯的姐姐瓦斯利基和她的丈夫多利亚尼图提出了证词。他们举出了具体事实，驳斥捏造格列索斯进行“间谍活动”的诬告，并且叙述了从1958年10月起政治警察局就开始制造所谓“格列索斯案件”的详细情节。审讯在继续进行中。
