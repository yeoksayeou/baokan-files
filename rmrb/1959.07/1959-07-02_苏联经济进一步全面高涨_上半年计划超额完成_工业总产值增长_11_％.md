Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 1st Dispatch by our reporter Li Nan: This year, the Soviet national economy has achieved a further comprehensive upsurge. Inspired by the great Seven-Year Plan, the working people are full of vigor and soaring enthusiasm. Judging from the development in various fields over the past six months, the pace of Soviet industrial and agricultural production has accelerated further, and new achievements have been made in improving production technology and organization. These new features indicate that not only this year's production plan but also the entire Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) may be completed ahead of schedule.

The implementation of the Soviet national economic plan in the first half of this year was very good. For several months, all Union republics and economic regions have overfulfilled their production plans without exception. The production plans in various places have been completed more comprehensively this year. Not only has the total output value plan been completed, but also good work has been done in increasing labor productivity, reducing production costs, and carrying out technological innovations. In addition, in the first half of this year, many regions completed their plans ahead of schedule earlier than in the past, and the amount of overfulfillment was also greater than in the past. For example, in the first six months of last year, the Soviet industrial total output value plan was completed by 104%, while in the first five months of this year it was completed by 105%. Many regions completed their industrial production plans before June 23, and some even in mid-June. In terms of agricultural production, the speed of spring sowing in the Soviet Union this year is also unprecedented, and the spring sowing work of collective farms is generally completed in about a week. By June 5, the entire Soviet Union had completed 100.6% of its spring sowing plan.

While the economic development plan has been completed very well, the pace of development of Soviet industrial and agricultural production has also accelerated compared with the past in the first half of this year. According to the state plan, the total industrial output value of the Soviet Union will increase by 7.7% this year compared with last year, while it increased by 11% in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, and 10.5% in the first half of last year compared with the first half of the year before last. In terms of agricultural production, the development of animal husbandry production is particularly good. Since the beginning of this year, the growth rate in this area is no longer a few percent, but tens of percent. In the first five months, the collective farms and state farms across the country delivered 54% more live livestock to the state than in the same period last year, 30% more milk, and 40% more eggs. It is expected that the Soviet economic development plan for the entire year will be completed extremely smoothly and will be overfulfilled by a large margin.

In the past six months, the Soviet Union has made new progress in improving economic management, strengthening planning work, and strengthening the ties between economic regions. First, continue to implement various measures to delegate power and give full play to the enthusiasm of enterprises. Now, economic regions, factories, and collective farms have participated in the formulation of plans, and the broad masses have also formulated their own plans. After the plans are formulated, various places have taken practical measures based on their own circumstances to strive to complete the plans ahead of schedule and tap production potential. The central government then concentrates and promotes these measures and initiatives. Second, the central government and the Union republics have strengthened the work of the State Planning Commission, and a series of specialized committees have been established under the Council of Ministers and the Planning Commission, absorbing experts from various fields to participate. At the same time, various specialized meetings are often held to discuss major issues. Since the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the central government and various localities have emphasized the timely completion of plans, not only focusing on the entire Seven-Year Plan, but also on the annual plan and the monthly plan. Therefore, the plan has been completed well from the beginning of this year. For example, the industrial production plan for January and February this year was completed by 104%, and after March, the target for the completion of the industrial production plan for each month exceeded 105%. Third, strengthen cooperation and ties between various economic regions, and gradually revise and formulate regulations on the relationship between enterprises and the supply of products between economic regions. Fourth, improve production organization and specialize many enterprises.

In the past six months, technological innovation and increased labor productivity have continued to be regarded as an important link in completing the Seven-Year Plan. The development in the past six months is that, in production innovation, the general line of technological innovation has been clarified as production automation and comprehensive mechanization. The construction of the fifty automated demonstration factories that the Soviet Union will build in the Seven-Year Plan has already begun.

Since the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people, under the call of "everyone must play their role during the Seven-Year Plan," have launched a national labor competition to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This competition first unfolded among enterprises in the industrial sectors of steel, machinery manufacturing, chemicals, construction, petroleum, and textiles, and then expanded to between economic regions. The competition wave spread throughout the country's factories, mines, collective farms, and state farms. Not long ago, the general target of various places in the competition was to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. However, after considering the production situation in the first few months of this year and the increasingly large potential discovered in the competition, recently, many republics and economic regions have further specifically proposed to complete the industrial and agricultural production tasks stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan one year, one and a half years, or even two years ahead of schedule. In this way, the national competition movement has entered a new and higher stage. Judging from the guarantees proposed, the targets set by various places in striving to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule are very high. However, the smooth completion of the Soviet national economic plan in the first half of this year and the acceleration of the development speed of industrial and agricultural production have already shown that these targets are realistic and can be fully realized. The Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) originally stipulated that by 1965, the total industrial output value would increase by 80% compared with 1958. If the plan is completed one year ahead of schedule, this ratio will increase to 93%. As Soviet First Deputy Prime Minister Mikoyan said not long ago at a mass rally at the Gorky Automobile Factory, the Soviet Union has begun to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan in six years instead of seven years, which is a big step towards communism.

### 苏联经济进一步全面高涨  上半年计划超额完成　工业总产值增长11％

    苏联经济进一步全面高涨
    上半年计划超额完成　工业总产值增长11％
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　本社记者李楠报道：今年上半年，苏联国民经济进一步全面高涨，劳动人民在伟大七年计划鼓舞下意气风发、干劲冲天。从过去六个月各方面发展情况看来，苏联工农业生产发展的速度更加加快了，在改进生产技术和生产组织方面所作的努力也取得了新的成果。这些新气象说明：不但今年的生产计划，而且整个七年计划（1959—1965年）都有可能提前完成。
    今年上半年苏联国民经济计划的执行情况非常良好。几个月来，各加盟共和国和各经济区都毫无例外地超额完成了生产计划。各地生产计划今年都完成得更加全面，不仅总产值计划完成了，而且在提高劳动生产率、降低生产成本、进行技术革新等方面也作得很好。此外，今年头半年，许多地区提前完成计划的时间比过去还早，超额的比数也比过去多。例如，去年前六个月，苏联工业总产值计划完成了104％，而今年头五个月就完成了105％。不少地区的工业生产计划在6月23日以前、有的甚至在中旬就提前完成了。在农业生产方面，苏联今年春播工作进展之快也是前所未有的，集体农庄的春播工作一般都是在一星期左右完成的。到6月5日，全苏联就已经以100.6％完成了春播计划。
    和经济发展计划很好地完成的同时，今年头半年，苏联工农业生产发展的速度也比过去加快了。按照国家计划的规定，今年苏联工业总产值要比去年增加7.7％，而今年上半年比去年同期增长了11％，去年上半年比前年上半年增长了10.5％。在农业生产方面，畜牧业生产发展情况尤其良好。今年以来，这方面的增长速度已不是百分之几，而是百分之几十。在头五个月内，全国集体农庄和国营农场交售给国家的活牲畜就比去年同期增加了54％，牛奶增加了30％，鸡蛋增加了40％。可以预料，今年全年苏联的经济发展计划将会极其顺利地完成，而且还会超额许多。
    今年半年来，苏联在改善经济管理、加强计划工作、加强各经济区的联系方面都有了新的进展。首先，继续贯彻执行各种下放权力、充分发挥企业积极性的措施。现在，各经济区、工厂、集体农庄都参加了制订计划的工作，广大群众也制订了自己的计划。在计划制定成以后，各地都根据自己的情况，采取了争取提前完成计划，发掘生产潜力的实际措施。中央根据这些措施和创议再加以集中和推广。第二，中央和各加盟共和国都加强了国家计划委员会的工作，在部长会议和计划委员会之下成立了一系列的专门委员会，吸收各方面的专家参加，同时又常常召开各种专门会议，讨论重大问题。苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，中央和各地都强调及时完成计划，不仅抓整个七年计划，而且抓本年度计划，抓每月计划，因此，今年一开始，计划就完成得良好。例如，今年1月、2月份的工业生产计划完成了104％，3月份以后，各月工业生产计划完成的指标都超过了105％。第三，加强各个经济区间的合作和联系，陆续修改和制订有关企业之间的关系以及各经济区之间产品供应等规章条例。第四，改进生产组织，将许多企业实行专业化。
    这半年来，技术革新和提高劳动生产率仍然被作为完成七年计划的一个重要环节。半年来的发展是，在生产革新中，又明确了以生产自动化和全盘机械化作为技术革新的总路线。七年计划中，苏联将建立的五十个自动化示范工厂已经开始进行建设。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，苏联人民在“每个人必须在七年计划期间起自己的作用”的号召下，展开了争取提前完成七年计划的全民劳动竞赛。这一竞赛先在钢铁、机器制造、化学、建筑、石油、纺织等工业部门的企业之间展开，随后，又扩大到各经济区之间，竞赛热潮遍及全国工厂、矿山、集体农庄和国营农场。不久以前，各地在竞赛中一般只提出要争取提前完成七年计划。但是，在考虑了今年头几个月的生产情况和竞赛中发掘出来的越来越大的潜力以后，最近，许多共和国和经济区已经进一步具体提出要提前一年、一年半甚至两年完成七年计划规定的工农业生产任务。这样，就使全民竞赛运动进入了一个新的、更高的阶段。从提出的保证看来，各地在争取提前完成七年计划方面所规定的指标都很高。但是，今年头半年苏联国民经济计划顺利完成的情况和工农业生产发展速度之加快已经可以说明，这些指标都是现实的，是完全有条件实现的。七年计划（1959—1965年）原规定到1965年把工业总产值比1958年增加80％。如果提前一年完成计划，这个比数就会提高为93％。正如苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬不久以前在高尔基汽车工厂一次群众集会上所说，苏联开始争取在六年内而不是在七年内完成七年计划，这是向共产主义的阔步迈进。（附图片）
