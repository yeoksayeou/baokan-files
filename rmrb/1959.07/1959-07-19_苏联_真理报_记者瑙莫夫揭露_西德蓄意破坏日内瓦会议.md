Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 18th: The "Pravda" correspondent in Geneva, Naumov, in commenting on the Bonn ruling clique's sabotage of the Geneva Conference, pointed out that the memorandum recently submitted by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to the United States, Britain, and France is a major act of sabotage after much consideration. In this memorandum, Bonn demanded that the Berlin issue be removed from the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference and that the Soviet proposal to establish an all-German committee be rejected. In this memorandum, the West German government shamelessly and openly stated that it was fundamentally opposed to the continuation of the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

The "Pravda" reporter pointed out that the delegations of the United States, Britain, and France did not stop the politicians and diplomats in Bonn, whose vicious opposition to international cooperation had reached the point of losing all sense of proportion. The day before yesterday, Grewe, inspired by the "Führer" spirit, resolutely stated that he was stating "the common view of the governments of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the (German) Federal Republic," and the representatives of the three Western countries remained silent when they heard Grewe's statement. The reporter asked, who gave Grewe this power? Was it the three Western countries? However, Naumov said that judging from the situation at the meeting, some Western ministers, including Herter, had not yet expressed their final opinion on the all-German committee issue. Have the politicians of the three Western countries been "intimidated" to such an extent by the Adenauer gang that they have to let them do whatever they want?

The "Pravda" reporter continued, it is difficult to understand how one can talk about the need to ease international tensions and the possibility of reaching agreements in international negotiations, while at the same time constantly watching the faces of the most vicious enemies of international cooperation entrenched in Bonn!

Naumov said that Bonn's disruption has become a major obstacle to achieving positive results in Geneva. He asked, how long can people tolerate this attitude? The West German ruling clique has repeatedly attempted to instigate the West against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in order to profit from it. How can people tolerate this practice any longer? Isn't it time for the Western countries, which are responsible for maintaining peace, to think carefully about the Federal Republic of Germany's provocative role in East-West relations and draw appropriate conclusions?

    苏联“真理报”记者瑙莫夫揭露
    西德蓄意破坏日内瓦会议
    新华社18日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：“真理报”驻日内瓦记者瑙莫夫在评述波恩统治集团对日内瓦会议的破坏行动时指出，德意志联邦共和国政府最近向美国、英国和法国提出的备忘录是经过多方考虑的重大的破坏行为。在这项备忘录中，波恩要求从外长会议议程上抹掉柏林问题，并且要求拒绝苏联提出的成立全德委员会的建议。西德政府在这项备忘录中恬不知耻地公开表明它根本反对外长会议继续举行。
    “真理报”记者指出，美国、英国和法国代表团丝毫没有制止波恩的政客和外交官，这些人反对国际合作的穷凶极恶作法已经到了失去了一切分寸的地步。前天，格雷韦在“元首”精神的激励下断然说，他是在陈述“法国、联合王国、美国和（德意志）联邦共和国政府的共同的观点”，而西方三国的代表听到格雷韦的这番谈话时竟然保持缄默。这位记者问道，是谁给了格雷韦这种权力？是三个西方国家吗？但是，瑙莫夫说，从会议的情况来判断，某些西方国家的部长，包括赫脱在内，还没有对全德委员会问题表示过最后的意见。难道西方三国的政治家已经被阿登纳一帮人“吓唬”到这样的地步，以致只好让他们为听欲为？
      “真理报”记者继续说，很难理解，怎么可以一方面大谈需要缓和国际紧张局势，大谈在国际谈判中达成协议的可能性，而同时又要不断看着那些盘据在波恩的国际合作最凶恶的敌人的脸色？！
    瑙莫夫说，波恩的捣乱已经成为妨碍在日内瓦取得积极成果的主要障碍。他问道，对于这种态度，人们能容忍多久呢？西德统治集团一再企图怂恿西方反对苏联和其他爱好和平的国家，以便从中得利。对于这种做法，人们怎能再容忍下去呢？对于维护和平负有责任的西方国家好好想一想德意志联邦共和国在东西方关系中的煽动作用，并作出适当的结论，这样的时候难道不是已经到来了吗？
