	Cooperative Treasure Digging

	Traditional Chinese medicine is the crystallization of the observation, analysis, and treatment experiences of diseases by Chinese physicians throughout the ages, containing limitless treasures. Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine should cooperate to unlock this medical treasure trove of the motherland. Currently, the Party organization of the Tianjin First Central Hospital promptly mobilized the masses, combined with practical experience, and adopted a method combining clinical practice and theoretical research. Based on the efficacy and existing problems of cooperative treatment of various diseases by traditional Chinese and Western medicine, more than sixty research projects were proposed. After careful research by traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, twelve items have achieved preliminary results within half a year. This is a very good approach. If all qualified hospitals across the country can do this, thousands of scientific research topics can be proposed, using modern scientific knowledge to interpret and enrich the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, allowing the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine to radiate even more brilliant light.

    合作挖“宝”
    祖国医药学是几千年来我国历代医学家对疾病的观察、分析和治疗经验的结晶，蕴藏着无限的宝藏。中西医应当通力合作去打开这个祖国的医学宝库。现在，天津市第一中心医院党组织及时发动群众，结合实际，采取临床实践与理论研究相结合的办法，根据中西医合作治疗各种疾病的疗效和存在的问题，提出了六十多个研究项目，经过中西医认真研究，半年内已有十二项取得初步成效。这是一种很好的作法。如果全国一切有条件的医院都能这样作，就可以提出成千成百的科学研究题目，用现代科学知识去解释、丰富祖国医学遗产，让祖国医学宝库放射出更加灿烂的光芒。
