"Organization of American States," Under U.S. Manipulation, Decides to Hold Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of American States

　　Comprehensive report from our newspaper, Washington dispatch: Under the manipulation and behind-the-scenes scheming of the United States, the Council of the "Organization of American States" adopted a resolution on the 13th, demanding that a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the twenty-one American states be convened soon to discuss the so-called tense situation in the Caribbean region.

　　As previously reported, at the Council meeting of the "Organization of American States" held on the 10th, a motion proposed by the Venezuelan representative was passed, deciding to postpone the discussion on convening a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the twenty-one American states to study the so-called situation in the Caribbean region, dealing a blow to the United States' plot to use the "Organization of American States" to intervene in Cuba and the national liberation movement in the Caribbean region. However, the United States was not willing to admit defeat and played another trick, instructing the representative of the Dominican Republic to withdraw the false accusations of "invasion" against Cuba and Venezuela, so that many countries no longer insisted on opposing the convening of the meeting of American Foreign Ministers. This is because Cuba and some other countries had stated that if it were not for the accusations of "invasion" against Cuba and Venezuela, the issue of convening a meeting of American Foreign Ministers could be reconsidered.

　　The decision of the Council meeting of the "Organization of American States" to convene a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the twenty-one American states is conducive to the United States stepping up its conspiracy activities to intervene in Cuba and the national revolutionary movement in the Caribbean region. Nevertheless, no agreement was reached at the meeting held on the 13th on the date, location, and agenda of the Foreign Ministers' meeting. This issue will be discussed by a committee composed of representatives from seven countries, including the United States, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, El Salvador, and Uruguay, and then propose recommendations. The first four countries are the proposers of the draft resolution passed at the meeting on the 13th.

    “美洲国家组织”在美国操纵下
    决定开美洲国家外长会议
    本报综合报道　华盛顿消息：在美国的操纵下和幕后阴谋活动下，“美洲国家组织”理事会在13日通过一项决议，要求在最近召开美洲二十一国外长会议，来讨论所谓加勒比海地区的紧张局势。
    前已报道，在10日举行的“美洲国家组织”理事会会议上，曾经通过委内瑞拉代表提出的一项动议，决定延期讨论关于召开美洲二十一国外长会议来研究所谓加勒比海地区局势的问题，使美国利用“美洲国家组织”来干预古巴和加勒比海地区民族解放运动的阴谋遭到一次打击。但是，美国并不甘心失败，它又耍了一个花招，指使多米尼加的代表撤回对古巴和委内瑞拉“入侵”的诬控，以便使许多国家不再坚持反对召开美洲外长会议的态度。因为，古巴和其他一些国家曾表示，如果不是由于指控古巴和委内瑞拉的“入侵”，那末，召开美洲外长会议的问题可以重新考虑。
    “美洲国家组织”理事会会议关于召开美洲二十一国外长会议的决定，有利于美国加紧进行干涉古巴和加勒比海地区民族革命运动的阴谋活动。但尽管如此，在13日举行的会议上并没有就外长会议召开的日期、地点和议程达成协议。这个问题将由一个由美国、巴西、智利、秘鲁、玻利维亚、萨尔瓦多和乌拉圭等七国代表组成的委员会讨论后提出建议，前四个国家是13日会议通过的决议草案的提议者。
