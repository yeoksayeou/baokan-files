    Sacks Woven from Citronella Grass After Oil Extraction
    Citronella grass, after oil extraction, can be used as a substitute for jute to make sacks. This has been successfully tested recently at the Guangdong Huajian Sack Factory, and production is scheduled to begin next month.
    Citronella grass is a perennial herb that can be harvested in the same year it is planted, and can be harvested two to three times each year. Citronella grass can be processed into citronella oil, which has a high economic value. At present, Hainan and Zhanjiang are planting citronella grass in large quantities. Local sack factories are also using the oil-extracted citronella grass to make sacks. One hundred catties of oil-extracted citronella grass, after degumming, can be processed into fifteen catties of citronella grass fiber.

    榨油后的香茅草织麻袋
    香茅草榨油之后可以代替黄麻制成麻袋。最近在广东华建麻袋厂已经试验成功，并且准备下月开始投入生产。
    香茅草是多年生草本植物，定植以后，当年便可以收割，而且每年可收割二至三次。香茅草可以加工出经济价值很高的香茅油。目前海南、湛江一带正在大量种植香茅草。当地的麻袋厂并利用榨去了油的香茅草来制麻袋。一百斤已榨油的香茅草，经过脱胶，可以加工成为香茅草纤维十五斤。
