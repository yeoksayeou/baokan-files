Xinhua News Agency, Miami, 6th: With the instigation of the United States, some exiled Batista elements gathered on the 4th and violently assaulted the Cuban Consul General in Miami, Alonso Hidalgo, and the representative of the Cuban Tourism Commission in that city, Rafael Barradas, with iron bars. After being injured, the two Cuban officials were then arrested by fifty American police officers who arrived to "suppress" the situation, on charges of "disorderly conduct," while the more than fifty assailants left freely, evading justice.

The 4th was the American Independence Day. While a Cuban delegation headed by the mayor of Havana was in the city participating in celebrations at the "invitation" of the mayor of Miami, thugs first tore down the Cuban flag held by the delegation, and later attacked some of the female members of the delegation in southwest Miami. When Consul General Hidalgo and Tourism Commission representative Barradas heard the news and went to rescue them, the thugs, wielding iron bars, surrounded them and beat them severely. The car they were in was also vandalized. When the American police arrived to "suppress" the situation, they released the assailants and arrested the two Cuban officials.

Following protests from the mayor of Havana, the two have now been released, but the Miami City Court will still summon them on the 8th on charges of "creating a riot."

After the event, Havana Mayor José Llanusa told reporters that he had reported the atrocity to the Cuban government.

It is reported that the assailants belong to a conspiracy organization called the "Anti-Communist Revolutionary Crusade." One of the leaders of this organization, former Cuban Senate candidate Richard Garcia, even publicly made a statement to reporters after the assault.

Miami, at the southern tip of the United States, is only two hundred-odd miles from the Cuban capital, Havana. The United States is using the large number of Batista elements gathered there as the vanguard for launching an armed invasion of Cuba. They openly buy arms there and publish newspapers, advocating "fighting back to Cuba."

    在美国当局的纵容下
    巴蒂斯塔分子殴打古巴外交官
    迈阿密市警察竟放走凶手逮捕受害人
    新华社6日讯　美国迈阿密消息：一些流亡的巴蒂斯塔分子在美国的教唆下，4日竟聚众行凶，用铁棍殴伤了古巴驻迈阿密总领事阿隆索·伊达尔哥和古巴游览事业委员会驻该市的代表拉斐尔·巴拉德斯。这两名古巴官员在被殴伤后，竟又被到场“弹压”的五十名美国警察以“捣乱行为”的罪名逮捕，而五十多名行凶的暴徒却扬长而去，逍遥法外。
    4日是美国的独立纪念日，以哈瓦那市长为首的一个古巴代表团正应迈阿密市长的“邀请”在这个城市参加庆祝活动时，暴徒们首先撕下了代表团所持的古巴国旗，后来在迈阿密西南部袭击了代表团的一部分妇女团员。总领事伊达尔哥和游览事业委员会代表巴拉德斯闻讯前往援救时，手执铁棍的暴徒们就围住他们横加殴打。所乘的汽车也遭捣毁。美国警察到场“弹压”时，却放走了凶手，而逮捕了他们两人。
    在哈瓦那市长的抗议下，现在他们两人已被释放，但是，迈阿密市法院仍将在8日以“制造暴乱”的罪名传讯他们。
    事后，哈瓦那市长何塞·利亚努萨向记者发表谈话说，他已把这起暴行报告了古巴政府。
    据报道，凶手们属于一个叫“反共革命十字军”的阴谋组织，这个组织的头目之一、古巴前参议员候选人理查德·加西亚在行凶后还公开向记者发表了谈话。
    美国南端的迈阿密距古巴首都哈瓦那只有二百多哩。美国正在利用麕集在那里的大批巴蒂斯塔分子充当向古巴发动武装侵略的先锋。他们在那里公开购买军火，并发行报纸，鼓吹“打回古巴去”。
