Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperation Drives Sideline Production in Forestry
Balin Right Banner Develops Diversified Economy

Hohhot, July 18 (Reported by our newspaper) – After implementing diversified operations, Balin Right Banner in Inner Mongolia has achieved an all-round leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production.

Thanks to the implementation of the policy of "taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations" by the people's communes in Balin Right Banner, the total number of livestock in the banner had increased from more than 530,000 head last year to more than 627,000 head by the end of June, a net increase of 18%. This is an unprecedented bumper harvest in animal husbandry on the Balin Grassland. At the same time, each agricultural and pastoral household also had one pig and six small poultry. The ten people's communes in the banner have established a total of fifty-seven milk powder factories, twenty-seven more than last year. Since the beginning of summer, these factories have produced more than twenty tons of whole milk powder to support the country, an increase of more than double compared to the same period last year.

Agricultural production in Balin Right Banner has always been rough, and yields have been very low. However, this year, the communes have grown very good crops in this hilly area with thin soil and little water. The more than 250,000 mu of wheat, naked oats, and other crops in the banner are growing stronger than in previous years, and the Mongolian and Han commune members are making every effort to strengthen field management. In the past, there were few crops in the hinterland of the grassland, but this year, large areas of feed bases have appeared. The people's communes have planted a total of 100,000 mu of feed crops, which has prepared a solid material foundation for the development of animal husbandry in the communes next year. In addition, more than 13,000 mu of trees have been planted on the agricultural and pastoral farms, in the fields, and next to the houses of the people's communes. The sideline income of each commune has also increased by more than double compared to the same period last year.

Before the people's commune system, agricultural and pastoral production in Balin Right Banner was basically separated. Herdsmen generally only raised livestock, and farmers only managed cultivation. After the communization, the Balin Right Banner Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made full use of the favorable situation for developing agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and sideline production. According to the policy of "taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations," they adopted the method of focusing on agricultural and pastoral cooperation, using the great development of agriculture and animal husbandry to drive other production, carrying out ideological mobilization, launching mass movements, and organizing this year's joint leap forward in agricultural and pastoral production and sideline production. One year of production practice has proved that the development of agriculture has promoted animal husbandry production, and the development of animal husbandry production has further promoted agriculture, while agriculture and animal husbandry have vigorously promoted forestry and sideline production. For example, when livestock overwintered and calved, the pastoral teams of each commune directly received a large amount of feed and fodder from their own communes, and the loss of various livestock decreased by 47% compared to the same period last year, while the survival rate of young animals increased by 4.5% compared to last year. Also, because herdsmen could get sufficient grain and vegetables from the commune, the consumption of livestock also decreased by 36% compared to the same period last year. In order to work together to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year, the pastoral teams of each commune sent strong plough horses and cattle and a large amount of animal manure fertilizer to the agricultural teams. This not only helped the farmers solve the difficulty of insufficient labor, but also enabled the agricultural teams to carry out deep plowing, close planting, and sufficient fertilization, making this year's crops grow well and strong. With the bumper harvest in animal husbandry and the great development of agriculture, commune members also had more favorable conditions for developing the dairy industry, grain and feed processing industry, raising pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, and operating other sideline production.

    农牧协作带动林副业生产
    巴林右旗发展多种经营
    本报呼和浩特18日电　内蒙古巴林右旗开展多种经营后，获得农林牧副全面跃进。
    内蒙古巴林右旗各人民公社，由于贯彻执行“以牧为主，农牧结合，开展多种经营”的方针，到6月底的统计，全旗牲畜总头数已由去年的五十三万多头增加到了六十二万七千多头，纯增率为18％。这是巴林草原上从来没有过的一次牧业大丰收。与此同时，每个农牧户也都有了一口猪和六只小家禽。全旗十个人民公社共建立了五十七个乳粉厂，比去年多了二十七座。入夏以来这些厂已经生产二十多吨全脂乳粉支援了国家，比去年同期增产一倍多。
    巴林右旗农业生产一向耕作粗糙，产量很低。但是，今年各公社在这丘陵起伏，土薄水少的地方，却种出了很好的庄稼。全旗二十五万多亩小麦、莜麦等农作物，都比往年长得茁壮旺盛，蒙汉族社员正全力加强田间管理。过去很少有庄稼的草原腹地，今年还出现了大片的饲料基地，各人民公社一共种了十万亩饲料作物，这对明年公社畜牧业的发展，又准备了雄厚的物质基础。另外，人民公社农牧场上，田野里、住宅旁还种了一万三千多亩树，各公社的副业收入，也比去年同期增加了一倍多。
    人民公社化以前，巴林右旗的农牧业生产基本上是分家的。牧民一般只养牲畜，农民只管种地。公社化以后，中共巴林右旗委员会充分利用了发展农牧林副业的有利形势，根据“以牧为主，农牧结合，开展多种经营”的方针，采取重点抓农牧协作，用农牧业大发展，带动其他生产的办法，进行思想发动，大搞群众运动，组织了今年的农牧生产和副业生产的共同跃进。一年的生产实践证明，农业的发展推动了牧业生产，牧业生产的发展，又进一步推动了农业，而农牧业又有力地推动了林业和副业生产。如牲畜过冬渡春和产羔的时候，各公社牧业队就直接从自己的公社得到大量饲料饲草，各种牲畜的损失比去年同期减少了47％，而幼畜成活率却比去年提高了4.5％。又因牧民们能从公社得到了充足的粮食、蔬菜，消耗的牲畜也比去年同期减少了36％。为了协力争取今年农业的丰收，各公社牧业队把健壮的耕马耕牛和大量畜粪肥料送到了农业队里。这不仅帮助农民解决了劳动力不足的困难，而且使农业队做到了深耕，密植，施足了肥料，使今年庄稼长得又好又壮。随着牧业的丰收和农业的大发展，社员们发展乳品工业、粮食饲料加工业，饲养猪鸡鸭鹅和经营其他副业生产也有了更为有利的条件。
