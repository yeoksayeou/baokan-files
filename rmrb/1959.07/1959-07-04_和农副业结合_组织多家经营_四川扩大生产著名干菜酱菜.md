Combining with Agriculture and Sideline Occupations, Organizing Multiple Operations
Sichuan Expands Production of Famous Dried and Pickled Vegetables

Chengdu, July 3rd (Our Newspaper) – Sichuan Province's commercial departments are actively organizing the production of non-staple foods, vigorously developing famous dried and fresh side dishes to meet the needs of the broad masses.

To date, the province has increased its production to over 300 varieties of side dishes, including daylily, wood ear, pickled mustard tuber, dried bamboo shoots, pickled Chinese mustard, Tianjin preserved vegetable, Sichuan芽菜 (Ya Cai - Sichuan Pickled Mustard Greens), and sliced magnolia, as well as fermented bean curd,糟蛋 (Zao Dan - eggs preserved in fermented grain), pickles, and pickled vegetables, which are most closely related to the daily lives of the broad masses. The areas of production and processing extend from large cities such as Chengdu and Chongqing to the public canteens of rural people's communes.

Sichuan Province has a relatively good foundation for the production of various non-staple food sundries, with a wide variety of products and abundant raw materials. It has always possessed the technology and habits of production. In order to meet the ever-increasing living requirements of the people inside and outside the province, commercial departments have made timely arrangements for the production of various famous side dishes this year. Nanchong Prefecture adopted the method of unified arrangement and multiple operations. This year, it has processed 200,000 jin of Tianjin preserved vegetable. In the mountainous areas of Guangyuan, Wangcang, and Tongjiang, which are the main producers of wood ear, commercial departments have formed roving teams to help communes rationally arrange labor and go up the mountains to engage in wood ear production. After overall arrangements for agriculture and sideline occupations, Wangcang County has drawn more than 10,000 laborers from various communes to concentrate on the production and processing of wood ear. In major and medium-sized cities, advantage is taken of the current peak season for vegetables to organize suburban communes and pickle shops to process pickles and pickled vegetables. Various general merchandise stores and non-staple food management departments in Wanxian City overcame the difficulty of not having factory buildings and processed 35 kinds of pickles and pickled vegetables, totaling more than 1.65 million jin in just half a month. Commercial departments also guarantee priority supply of various raw materials needed for making pickles.

This year, various localities have also paid attention to opening up new production areas and expanding production. For example, this year, Sichuan pickled mustard tuber, which is famous, has not only expanded the planting area in the old producing areas of Fuling and Wanxian, but also Neijiang, Leshan, Luzhou, Nanchong, Daxian and other prefectures have begun production. In the past, Sichuan daylily was mainly concentrated in Quxian County. Now, after artificial transplantation, ten prefectures and two cities across the province have begun production, with good quality and high output. In order to prepare for the mass production of dried bamboo shoots, Luzhou, Leshan, Ya'an and other prefectures are currently investigating the production potential of autumn bamboo shoots.

    和农副业结合　组织多家经营
    四川扩大生产著名干菜酱菜
    本报成都3日电　四川省商业部门在积极组织副食品生产中，大力发展干鲜著名小菜，供应广大群众的生活需要。
    到目前为止，全省生产的各种小菜已增加到三百多种，包括与广大人民日常生活最为密切的黄花、木耳、榨菜、笋干、腌大头菜、冬菜、芽菜、玉兰片，以及豆腐乳、糟蛋、酱菜、泡菜等。生产加工的地区，从成都、重庆等大城市，遍及农村人民公社的公共食堂。
    四川省是各种副食杂品生产基础较好的一个地区，品种繁多，原料充足，历来就有生产的技术和习惯。为了满足省内外人民日益提高的生活要求，今年商业部门对各种名小菜的生产及时作了安排。南充专区采取统一安排、多家经营的办法后，今年已加工了二十万斤冬菜。在主产木耳的广元、旺苍、通江等山区，商业部门组成巡回小组，帮助公社合理安排劳力，上山搞木耳生产。旺苍县经过农副业统筹安排以后，已从各公社抽出一万多个劳动力，突击生产和加工木耳。在各大、中城市，也利用现在蔬菜旺季，组织郊区公社、酱园加工酱腌菜。万县市各综合商店，副食品经理部克服了没有厂房的困难，在短短半个月内，加工了三十五种酱腌菜，共一百六十五万多斤。制造酱菜需要的各种原料，商业部门也保证优先供应。
    今年各地还注意开辟新的产区，扩大生产。如著名的四川榨菜今年不仅扩大了涪陵、万县等老产区的种植面积，就是内江、乐山、泸州、南充、达县等专区也开始生产。过去四川黄花主要集中在渠县一地生产，现在经过人工移植，全省已有十个专区、二个市开始生产，质量良好、产量亦高。为了准备大量生产笋干，目前泸州、乐山、雅安等专区正在调查秋笋的生产潜力。　（范眭）（附图片）
