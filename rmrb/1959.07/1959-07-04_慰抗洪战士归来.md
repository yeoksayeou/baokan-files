The spring breeze and rain were still evenly distributed,
But don't say that heaven's grace is deep.
Wild hailstones attack, threatening to shatter tiles,
Ferocious waves roll, threatening to topple mountains.
The people have the power to turn the tide,
Snakes and scorpions find it hard to use their poisonous sting.
I believe miracles will appear after autumn,
Disaster scars will be gone, replaced by new villages.

    慰抗洪战士归来
    陶铸
    入春风雨尚均匀，莫道天公恩惠深。
    狂霰袭来瓦欲裂，恶涛卷到岳为倾。
    人民自有回天力，蛇蝎难施螫毒针。
    我信奇迹现秋后，灾痕不见见新村。
