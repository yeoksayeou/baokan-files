    Visiting the Western Regions of Poland
    By Our Correspondent Li Ke

        The Rebirth of the Western Lands

    Our visit to the western regions of Poland began in the city of Wrocław, and we toured several factories and villages. Wrocław is known as the center of the western regions of Poland, and the famous Oder River quietly meanders through the city.

    The so-called western regions of Poland include the entirety of the five provinces of Wrocław, Szczecin, Zielona Góra, Koszalin, and Opole, as well as parts of the provinces of Katowice, Olsztyn, Gdańsk, and Poznań, totaling one hundred and thirteen counties and one hundred and five thousand square kilometers. This is the ancient Polish land that Poland recovered from the Germans after World War II.

    When Poland had just recovered these areas, 6,800 of the original 8,800 enterprises were completely destroyed, industrial production capacity decreased by 60%, most of the land was barren, 90% of the livestock and poultry died, and railways, bridges, and houses were severely damaged. After fourteen years of restoration and construction since liberation, the western regions have completely changed their appearance, with the destroyed brought back to life, and the newborn growing up.

    During the rule of the German fascist regime, the western regions failed to keep up with the development of the German economy and remained stagnant. The industrial production in this area at that time only accounted for 5.8% of German industrial production, and agricultural production only accounted for 3.5% of German agricultural production. For decades, there was a phenomenon that was completely opposite to the present – population outflow. When we visited Wrocław, local comrades told us that this area was not valued at all during the German fascist rule, because the main investment destination of German monopoly capital was the Ruhr area, and they were unwilling to have industrial development in other regions. For example, the coking coal in the Wałbrzych area is of high quality, but before the war, German monopoly capital stipulated that the coking coal here could only be sold locally. Therefore, the high-quality coking coal here had to be used to burn stoves for heating. Now it is liberated and used for its proper purpose, used by the Lenin Steelworks in Nowa Huta for steelmaking.

    Only after returning to Poland did the western regions get rid of the neglected treatment and begin to serve the people by making the best use of their talents and resources. The secrets underground were explored, and hundreds of millions of tons of minerals were discovered. Not long ago, in the Legnica-Głogów area, which the Germans had surveyed many times without success, Polish geological personnel found a large copper mine, and the proven reserves can now be firmly ranked first in Europe.

    Development Speed Higher Than Other Provinces

    Whether in Warsaw or in the western provinces, we often heard the argument that after fourteen years of construction, the western regions have been completely integrated with the motherland in terms of economy and social life, and the particularity of the western regions no longer exists. The name "western regions" has also lost its past meaning. Now it is still called "western regions", but it is just a historical name.

    If the western regions now have any differences from other regions, it is that their development speed is faster than other provinces. From liberation to 1958, one-third of the six hundred billion złoty (Polish currency) of state investment was used to develop the western regions, while the population of the western regions only accounted for one-quarter of the country, so the economic development of the western regions has always been faster than other provinces. Its natural population growth rate is also the highest in the country. In the next period, this situation of higher development speed than other regions will continue to be maintained. In the next five-year plan period, the state plans to build one hundred and forty-four large industrial enterprises, forty of which are expected to be built on western lands, and some enterprises are also prepared to move to the western regions.

    Due to the rapid development of the western regions, they account for an increasingly large proportion of the entire national economy and play an increasingly important role. In 1948, the industrial production of the western regions only accounted for 20% of the total national industrial production, and in 1958 it had risen to 27%; in 1948, agricultural production accounted for 19% of the country, and in 1958 it had reached 30%. Now the western regions account for 32% of the country's electricity production, 29% of hard coal, 96% of lignite, 51% of coking coal, 22% of steel, 52% of sulfuric acid, and 48% of machine tools. The western regions are also the only production area for many products such as Polish synthetic dyes and pulp.

        Laboring People Are Full of Enthusiasm

    During our visit to the western regions, we visited the Dzierżyński Electrical Machinery Factory and the Pafawag Rolling Stock Factory in Wrocław. Both of these factories are among the largest enterprises in the country and were built on ruins after the war. In these two different places, we saw exactly the same scene, that is, the vigorous labor enthusiasm of the working masses. In the endless workshops of the Dzierżyński Electrical Machinery Factory, we saw workers working tensely and happily. According to Comrade Jaroszyński, the factory manager who accompanied us on the visit, the factory's total output value in 1958 increased by 60% compared with 1957, but without adding a single worker. During our visit, we saw that all the workers in the factory were involved in the movement to trial-produce a 50,000-kilowatt generator, and they brought forward the deadline for successful trial production, which was originally scheduled for the end of the year, to the 15th anniversary of Polish National Day – July 22. From the factory director to the car driver, everyone made guarantees. In order to realize this guarantee, all the engineering and technical personnel and workers of the factory are dedicating their time, wisdom and efforts.

    The Pafawag Rolling Stock Factory is a large factory with seven or eight thousand people. The workers proposed to increase the total value of products by 25% this year and double the output by 1965. This is naturally not easy to obtain, but the workers showed their confidence in achieving this goal with their hard work.

    We also saw the same situation when we visited the countryside. When we went to visit the Wojszyce Agricultural Production Cooperative, we couldn't even find a single person in the village. All the members went to work in the fields.

    The soaring labor enthusiasm of the working people is the reason why the western regions can achieve such rapid development and such great construction achievements, and it is also a guarantee for continuing to achieve construction achievements in the future.

    Build the Western Regions
      Even More Beautifully

    Although West German militarists refuse to recognize Poland's western border, the western regions will always be Poland's. In Warsaw and Wrocław, we often heard people say when talking about the western regions: "The entire socialist camp guards the Oder-Neisse border," "Our border is on the Elbe River"; or more humorously: "If Mr. Adenauer wants to come to Poland, he must first obtain a visa from the German Democratic Republic." "The mood of the residents when they first arrived in the western regions in the early days of liberation, sitting on suitcases, has long been swept away. They want to live and multiply here for generations. It is enough to cite one fact: among the seven and a half million residents on the western lands, two million and six hundred thousand are young people and children born on the western lands in the past fourteen years. Therefore, the broad masses of the western regions are concerned about how to build here even more beautifully. The residents are running orchards here, beautifying villages, and planning to build six or seven hundred thousand houses in the next seven years. The state's investment in the western regions is higher than in general areas, just like in the past fourteen years. This year, the state budget has a total of 78 billion złoty for investment in basic construction, of which 23 billion złoty is invested in the western regions.

    The western regions are now like a large construction site. Existing enterprises are being expanded, and new enterprises are growing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Twenty new enterprises alone will be completed and put into production this year. Large mines, power stations, and factories producing steel, nylon, and sugar are under construction on the western lands.

    Among all the projects under construction, the most noteworthy is the Turów Thermal Power Station, which started construction in 1958. After its completion in 1965, its power generation capacity will reach 1.2 million kilowatts, making it the largest thermal power station in Europe. This is a large-scale construction project like the Lenin Steelworks in Nowa Huta, with a total investment of 10 billion złoty. In addition to supplying the needs of Polish industry, the power station can also supply the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia. Another construction center is in the Legnica-Głogów copper mining area. By 1965, the copper production here will reach more than 2 million tons.

    The western regions, like other regions of Poland, are changing with each passing day. (Attached picture)

    访波兰西部地区
    本报记者　李克
        西部土地的新生
    我们从弗罗茨瓦夫城开始了在波兰西部地区的访问，参观了一些工厂和乡村。弗罗茨瓦夫被称为波兰西部地区的中心，有名的奥得河就从市中静静地蜿蜒流过。
    所谓波兰西部地区包括弗罗茨瓦夫、什切青、茨格纳格拉、柯萨林、奥波尔五个省的全部，以及卡托维茨、奥尔兹丁、革但斯克、波兹南等省的一部分，共有一百一十三个县，十万五千平方公里。它是第二次世界大战后波兰从德国人手中收复的古老的波兰土地。
    当波兰刚刚收复这些地区时，这里原有的八千八百多个企业中有六千八百个遭到彻底破坏，工业生产能力下降了60％，大部分土地荒芜了，90％的牲畜和家禽死亡了，铁路、桥梁、屋舍都受到严重破坏。经过解放后十四年的恢复建设，西部地区已完全改变了面貌，被破坏了的恢复了生命，新生的成长了起来。
    在德国法西斯政权统治时期，西部地区没有能跟上德国经济的发展，一直陷于停滞状态，这一地区的工业生产当时只占德国工业生产的5.8％，农业生产只占德国农业生产的3.5％，几十年期间，一直存在和现在完全相反的现象——人口外流。当我们在弗罗茨瓦夫访问的时候，当地的同志告诉我们说：这一地区在德国法西斯统治时期，根本不受重视，因为德国垄断资本主要的投资地在鲁尔区，他们根本不愿意有另外地区的工业发展起来。比如瓦尔布瑞赫地方的焦煤是质地优良的焦煤，可是在战前，德国的垄断资本规定这里的焦煤只能在当地销售，所以这里上等的焦煤只好用来烧火炉取暖，到现在它才解放出来，用于应该的用途，诺瓦胡塔的列宁冶金厂用来炼钢。
    只是在回归波兰之后，西部地区才摆脱了受冷落的待遇，开始物尽其材、地尽其利地为人民服务，地下的秘密被探索了出来，发现了成亿吨的矿产。不久之前，就在德国人几经勘察而毫无所得的利格尼察一格沃古夫地方，波兰地质人员找到了大铜矿，现已查明的储量就可稳居欧洲第一。
    发展速度高过其它省区
    无论在华沙或者在西部省区，我们都常常听到这种议论：经过十四年的建设，西部地区在经济上和社会生活方面都已经和祖国完全溶合为一个不可分的整体，西部地区的特殊性已不存在，“西部地区”的名称也失去了像过去所具有的含义，现在仍然称之为“西部地区”，不过是沿用历史名称而已。
    如果说西部地区现在还有和其它地区不同的地方，那就是它的发展速度比其它省区快。从解放后到1958年，国家拨出的六千亿兹罗提（波币）投资总额中，有三分之一是用于发展西部地区的，而西部地区的人口只占全国的四分之一，所以西部地区的经济发展一直比其它省区快。它的人口自然增殖率也是全国最高的。在今后一个时期，这种发展速度比其它地区为高的情况仍将保持。在下一个五年计划时期中，国家准备兴建一百四十四个大型工业企业，其中有四十个预计要建设在西部土地上，有一些企业还准备迁移到西部地区来。
    由于西部地区的迅速发展，它在整个国民经济中占着越来越大的比重，发挥着日益重要的作用。1948年西部地区的工业生产只占全国工业生产总值的20％，1958年已上升到27％；1948年农业生产占全国的19％，1958年已占到30％。现在西部地区的电力生产占全国的32％，石煤29％，褐煤96％，焦煤51％，钢22％，硫酸52％，车床48％。西部地区还是波兰合成染料、纸浆等许多产品的唯一产地。
        劳动人民干劲十足
    我们在西部地区访问时，曾参观了弗罗茨瓦夫城的杰尔仁斯基电机制造厂和帕法瓦克车厢厂。这两个工厂都属于全国最大的企业之列，是战后在废墟上建立起来的。在这两个不同的地方，我们看到了完全相同的景象，即工人群众蓬勃的劳动热情。在杰尔仁斯基电机厂一眼望不到头的、一个接一个的车间里，我们看到工人们都在紧张而愉快地劳动。据陪同参观的工厂经理雅罗辛斯基同志说，全厂1958年生产总值比1957年增加了60％，但没有增加一个工人。我们在参观时看到，全厂的工人都卷入试制五万瓩发电机的运动，他们把原订于年底试制成功的期限，提前到波兰国庆十五周年纪念日——7月22日。从厂长到汽车司机都提出了保证。为了实现这一保证，全厂的工程技术人员和工人都在献出他们的时间、智慧和心血。
    帕法瓦克车厢厂是一个有七八千人的大工厂，工人们提出今年要把产品总值增加25％，到1965年时把产量翻一番。这自然是不能轻易得到的，但是工人们以自己奋发的劳动，显示出他们有信心实现这个指标。
    我们在参观农村时也看到同样情况，当我们去参观沃依什切农业生产合作社的时候，我们在村庄里甚至找不到一个人，所有的社员都到田间劳动去了。
    劳动人民高涨的劳动热情是西部地区所以能获得如此飞跃发展，取得如此巨大建设成绩的原因，也是今后继续取得建设成就的保证。
    把西部地区建设
      得更美好
    尽管西德的军国主义者不肯承认波兰的西部边界，西部地区也永远是波兰的了。在华沙，在弗罗茨瓦天我们常常听到人们在谈论西部地区时爱说：“整个社会主义阵营守卫着奥得—尼斯边界”，“我们的边界在易北河上”；或者更有风趣的说：“阿登纳先生们要想到波兰来，必须先得到德意志民主共和国的签证。”“解放初期居民刚到西部地区时那种坐在行李箱子上的情绪早已一扫而光，他们要世世代代在这里休养生息。举出一件事实就够了，在西部土地上的七百五十万居民中，有二百六十万人是最近十四年在西部土地上诞生的青年和孩子。因此，西部地区广大人民关心的是如何把这里建设的更美好。居民们在这里经营果园，美化村落，并且计划在最近七年中建造六、七十万间住宅。国家在西部地区的投资像以往十四年一样高于一般地区。今年国家预算中用于基本建设投资的款项共计七百八十亿兹罗提，其中二百三十亿兹罗提投资在西部地区。
    西部地区现在像一个大建筑场，旧有的企业在扩建，新的企业像雨后春笋般成长起来，仅今年一年内就有二十个新企业建成投入生产。在西部土地上正在建设的有大矿井，电力站，生产钢铁、尼龙、砂糖的工厂。
    在所有正在建设的项目中，最引人注意的是1958年动工的图鲁夫热电站，1965年建成后，他的发电能力可达到一百二十万瓩，是目前欧洲最大的火力电站。这是一个像诺瓦胡塔列宁冶金厂这类大型的建设项目，全部投资需十亿兹罗提。电力站除了可供应波兰工业所需外，还可以供应德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克。另一个建设中心在利格尼察—格渥古夫铜矿区，到1965年这里的铜矿产量要达到二百多万吨。
    西部地区像波兰其他地区一样，它的面貌正在日新月异。（附图片）
