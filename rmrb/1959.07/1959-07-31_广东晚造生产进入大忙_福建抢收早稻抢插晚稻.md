Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 29th: Guangdong Province's late rice production is entering a fully busy season from south to north. On the fields where early rice has just been harvested, millions of farmers are again working intensely to transplant late rice. About ten million mu of paddy fields across the province have been planted with tender green late rice seedlings, and more than three million mu of dry land have been planted with sweet potatoes and various miscellaneous grain crops.

In the process of preparing for late rice planting and transitioning to transplanting, various localities have conscientiously summarized various experiences for achieving high yields, using the summer harvest to promote the autumn harvest. After summarizing the experience of “early planting leading to good harvests in nine out of ten years,” counties on Hainan Island have generally implemented early planting. The quality of transplanting is also better than last year, with rational close planting mostly achieved.

In order to seize the season and strive to complete transplanting before the "Beginning of Autumn," giving the late rice enough growing time to avoid the threat of "cold dew wind" and pests, various localities have combined summer harvesting with plowing, harrowing, and fertilizer delivery, making the progress of land preparation faster than last year. Most of the rice fields after the summer harvest have been plowed in a timely manner, and the quality of fertilizer applied is also better than last year. In the Chaoshan Plain counties, most rice fields have undergone two plows and ten harrows. According to statistics, each mu of late rice in the province has an average of more than sixty dan of base fertilizer. In the Shantou region, where more fertilizer has been accumulated, more than one-third of the prepared base fertilizer has been delivered to the fields. Before the summer harvest, many seedlings across the province were damaged by floods or waterlogging due to the impact of severe floods and rainstorms, and those that were not submerged also grew relatively yellow and weak; however, once the floods passed, various localities quickly drained the water, replanted, applied additional fertilizer, and controlled pests, and now the seedlings have generally become stronger.

As soon as transplanting began, people's communes in various localities rationally arranged labor and carried out high work efficiency competitions centered on transplanting, greatly improving transplanting efficiency.

Late rice production has always accounted for more than 60% of Guangdong's total annual grain output. This year, the province plans to plant 35 million mu of late rice and 10 million mu of sweet potatoes. Through mass discussions, various localities have formulated plans, targets, and various technical measures for late rice production in accordance with local conditions. People's communes throughout the province are doing everything possible to tap the potential of the land and expand the area of late rice production. Many communes have organized expeditions to reclaim wasteland, striving to plant more and harvest more. In late rice production, various localities have generally divided their forces into two groups: one group carefully manages large areas of high-yield fields, and the other is dedicated to transforming low-yield fields, striving for comprehensive and balanced yield increases in late rice production.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 29th: As the sickles of more than three million summer harvest troops in Fujian Province rise, hundreds of thousands of mu of rice are being harvested every day. At present, the early rice harvesting work in coastal areas such as southern Fujian and central Fujian has basically ended, and the harvesting area in mountainous areas such as eastern Fujian and northern Fujian has also exceeded more than half. The western Fujian mountainous area, which started later due to climate impact, is also rushing to harvest at a rate of nearly 100,000 mu per day.

This year's early rice production in Fujian Province has generally grown well because most of the land has been deeply plowed, planted in a timely manner, and densely planted rationally. Among the province's more than seven million mu of early rice, except for some fields that suffered damage from continuous overcast and rainy weather and rainstorms during the flowering and grain-filling stages, the output of most of the remaining fields has increased compared to last year. In the remote mountainous area of Pinghe County, the average mu yield of early rice in the Baofeng Brigade of the Shange Commune increased by more than 40% compared to last year. The 618 mu of early rice that has been harvested, dried, and winnowed by the Nanxi Brigade of the Bangtou Commune in Xianyou County has an average mu yield that is more than 50% higher than last year, of which 102.7 mu of high-yield fields reached a mu yield of 1,038 jin and 10 liang.

While the summer harvest is busy, the summer planting is also starting one after another in various places. The area of continuous cropping late rice that has been transplanted in the province currently accounts for one-sixth of the planned planting area. In order to ensure that the summer harvest and summer planting are not delayed, production teams in various communes have planned the summer harvest and summer planting labor in a planned manner, carried out tool reforms and high work efficiency competition campaigns, and widely promoted the assembly line operation method of harvesting, threshing, plowing, applying base fertilizer, dissolving the soil, and transplanting at the same time, so that the summer harvest and summer planting are mostly done quickly and well, and most late rice fields are also plowed deeper and harrowed more finely than last year.

    广东晚造生产进入大忙
    福建抢收早稻抢插晚稻
    据新华社广州29日电　广东省晚造生产由南到北开始全面大忙。在刚刚收获了早稻的田野上，数以百万计的农民又紧张地抢插晚稻。全省有一千万亩左右的水田已经栽上了嫩绿的晚稻秧苗，还有三百多万亩旱地种下了番薯和各种杂粮作物。
    各地在晚造备耕和转入插秧的过程中，都认真地总结各项丰产经验，以夏促秋。海南岛各县总结了
  “十年早，九年好”的经验后，普遍实行了早插。插秧质量也比去年好，大都做到了合理密植。
    各地为了抢季节，争取“立秋”前插完秧，使晚稻有足够的生长期，避过“寒露风”和虫害的威胁，都结合夏收，边刈、边犁、边耙、边送肥，整田进度比去年快。夏收后的稻田，大部分已及时犁翻，施的肥料质量也比去年好。潮汕平原各县大部分稻田都经过二犁十耙。据统计，全省每亩晚稻平均已有基肥六十多担。积肥较多的汕头专区，准备好的基肥三分之一以上已经送到田里。夏收前由于特大洪水和风雨的侵袭，全省有不少秧苗被洪水或渍水淹坏，没有受浸的长得也比较黄弱；但是洪水一过，各地迅速排涝补播，追施肥料，除治虫害，现在秧苗已普遍转壮。
    插秧一开始，各地人民公社都合理安排劳力，开展以插秧为中心的高工效竞赛，插秧效率大为提高。
    晚造粮食生产向来占广东全年粮食总产量的六成以上。今年全省计划种植晚稻三千五百万亩，番薯一千万亩。各地通过群众性的讨论，因地制宜地订出了晚造生产的计划、指标和各项技术措施。全省各人民公社都千方百计挖掘土地潜力，扩大晚造生产面积。许多公社组织了远征开荒队，力争多种多收。各地在晚造生产中，普遍分兵两路，一路细致经营大面积高产田，一路专责改造低产田，要晚造全面平衡增产。
    据新华社福州29日电　福建省三百多万夏收大军镰刀起处，每天都有几十万亩稻谷登场。目前闽南、闽中等沿海地区早稻收获工作已基本结束，闽东、闽北等山区收割面积也都超过半数以上，因气候影响、开镰较迟的闽西山区，也正以日割近十万亩的速度进行抢收。
    今年福建省的早稻生产，由于大部分土地经过深翻、种植适时、密植合理，一般生长良好。全省七百多万亩早稻中，除了一部分田在扬花灌浆和黄熟时遭受连绵阴雨和暴风雨等损害而减产以外，其余大部分产量都比去年增加。在偏僻山区的平和县，山格公社宝丰大队全队早稻平均亩产量比去年增加四成多。仙游县榜头公社南溪大队已收割和晒干扬净的六百一十八亩早稻，平均亩产量比去年增加五成多，其中有一百零二亩七厘丰产田亩产达一千零三十八斤十两。
    在夏收大忙的同时，各地夏种大忙也陆续开始。全省目前已插下的连作晚稻已占计划种植面积六分之一。为了保证夏收夏种两不误，各公社生产队都有计划地安排夏收夏种劳力，开展工具改革和高工效竞赛运动，广泛推广边收、边打、边犁、边施基肥、边溶田、边插秧等流水作业法，从而使夏收夏种大多作得又快又好，大部分晚稻田也比去年犁得深、耙得细。
