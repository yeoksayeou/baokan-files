    Our Scientists Zhao Jiuzhang and Bei Shizhang Point Out that Soviet High-Altitude Rockets are a Major Creation

    (Reported by this newspaper) Zhao Jiuzhang, Director of the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Bei Shizhang, Director of the Institute of Biophysics, made statements on the 8th, praising the significant achievement of the Soviet Union's successful launch of a high-altitude biological experiment rocket.

    Zhao Jiuzhang said that the altitude distribution of various high-altitude physical factors is constantly changing, so systematic exploration is necessary to obtain information in this area. The Soviet Union's announcement regarding rocket exploration shows that the Soviet Union has been conducting systematic research in this area. He said that the weight of the instruments carried by the rocket this time is estimated to be more than twice the weight of those carried by previous rockets, and it can be inferred that the altitude it reached is higher than that of previous rockets. In the past, data on light gases related to the composition of the atmosphere could not be measured. The announcement mentioned that information on the composition of some light gases in the atmosphere has been obtained. This is new and valuable data. Soviet rockets have great propulsion, so they can carry many instruments, which facilitates comprehensive experiments. For example, to study the effects of solar ultraviolet rays, particle streams, and cosmic rays on organisms at high altitudes, it is necessary to simultaneously measure various radiations and various animal physiological functions on a single rocket in order to conduct comparative research. Zhao Jiuzhang said that the characteristic of Soviet rocket detection technology is the safe landing device, which is an important issue in solving the problem of re-entering the atmosphere in space flight.

    Bei Shizhang said that the successful launch and safe landing of the Soviet high-altitude geophysical rocket carrying dogs and rabbits, fully loaded with new scientific data, is an extremely important creation. He expressed his joy and encouragement for the great achievements made by Soviet scientists in the cause of peace once again.

    Bei Shizhang said that the new scientific data obtained from the Soviet Union's launch of high-altitude geophysical rockets carrying experimental animals has laid some foundation for further research on the conditions required for space travel. Such a great scientific achievement can only be realized in a socialist system.

### 我国科学家赵九章、贝时璋指出  苏联高空火箭是重大的创造

    我国科学家赵九章、贝时璋指出
    苏联高空火箭是重大的创造
    本报讯　中国科学院地球物理研究所所长赵九章、生物物理研究所所长贝时璋8日发表谈话，赞扬苏联成功发射高空生物试验火箭的重大成就。
    赵九章说，高空物理各种因素的高度分布是时常在变化的，因此必须进行系统探测，才能获得这方面的资料。苏联这次发布的关于火箭探测公报，说明了苏联一直在进行这方面的系统研究。他说，这次发射的火箭所带仪器重量，估计要比过去火箭所带的重一倍多，同时可以推测它所达到的高度比过去发射的火箭高。过去一直未能测得有关大气组成的轻气体的资料，这次公报中提到已获得大气中一些轻气体组成的情报，这是新的有价值的资料，苏联火箭推动力大，所以可以带许多仪器，这样就便于进行综合性的实验，例如生物在高空中受太阳紫外线、粒子流、宇宙线的影响，就必须在一个火箭上同时测量各种辐射及各种动物生理机能的资料，才能进行比较研究。赵九章说，苏联火箭探测技术的特点是安全降落的装置，这是解决宇宙飞行中重回大气层的一个重要问题。
    贝时璋说，带着狗和兔两种动物的苏联高空地球物理火箭成功发射并且满载新的科学资料安全着陆，是极其重要的创造。他表示为苏联科学家在和平事业中再次取得伟大成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    贝时璋说，苏联发射带有试验动物的高空地球物理火箭所获得的新的科学资料，对进一步研究宇宙旅行应具备的条件奠定了一些基础。这种伟大的科学成就只有在社会主义制度的国家才能实现。
