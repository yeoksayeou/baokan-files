Turning Scrap from Big Factories into Raw Materials for Small Factories
Guangzhou Organizes the Clearing of Edge Materials and Waste from Large Factories to Support Small General Merchandise Factories

According to Guangzhou Daily, large factories such as Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant and Guangzhou Shipyard are actively supporting the production of daily-use industrial products. Recently, they cleared out approximately 130 tons of waste and scrap steel to supply small hardware and stationery manufacturing plants for the production of daily necessities.

In the past, some large factories in Guangzhou had already used waste and scrap materials to support the production of certain small hardware manufacturing plants. However, these factories lacked a fixed connection, so the waste and scrap materials were not fully utilized in production. Recently, in order to fully leverage the role of large factories in supporting small factories and to open up a wider source of materials for daily-use industrial products, the Materials Inventory Leading Group Office of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee and the Guangzhou Planning Commission organized a meeting with relevant factories, the Municipal Light Industry Bureau, and the Municipal Waste Products Company. They decided to collect as much waste and scrap material as possible that had been accumulated in the past and that would be generated successively in the production process in the future, to support the production of daily-use industrial products.

After the meeting, the Municipal Light Industry Bureau immediately organized personnel to go to major factories to investigate the situation of waste and scrap materials. The factories also actively supported this effort. For example, Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant had accumulated more than 85 tons of steel billet cutoffs and other materials over the past year. After processing these into thin sheets or drawing them into wires, they could be used to manufacture small locks, knives and scissors, nail clippers, and other daily-use industrial products. The factory transferred all of these waste and scrap materials to the Light Industry Bureau for production arrangements.

After a preliminary investigation of more than ten units, a total of approximately 130 tons of waste and scrap materials could be used to support the manufacture of daily-use industrial products. The Municipal Light Industry Bureau has already allocated the transferred materials to dozens of factories manufacturing small locks, agricultural tools, sewing machine parts, nail clippers, umbrellas, knives and scissors, and other products. A small portion of the materials that are still being transferred will be supplied to factories manufacturing stationery, hair clips, lamp holders, and other products.

Currently, in addition to organizing more than ten factories to process these waste and scrap materials into sheets and wires, the Guangzhou Municipal Light Industry Bureau is signing agreements with the Mechanical and Electrical Industry Bureau and the Metallurgical Industry Bureau to establish fixed connections with relevant large factories. At the same time, it will expand the scope of connections and establish such supply relationships with some small and medium-sized factories.

The Municipal Planning Commission and the Municipal Production Commission recently also stipulated that the various waste and substandard steel materials, needle and cotton textile offcuts, waste paper, waste glass, old wood, waste rubber, and waste plastic currently existing in factories and enterprises and generated in the production process should be mostly or entirely transferred to the Light Industry Bureau, the Handicraft Industry Bureau, or recycled by the Municipal Waste Products Company to supply production departments. Furthermore, these supply relationships should be fixed and agreements signed to ensure that the needs of daily-use industrial products are met first.

    大厂废材变成小厂原料
    广州清理大厂边材废料有组织地支援小百货工厂
    据广州日报消息　广州钢铁厂、广州造船厂等大工厂积极支援日用工业品的生产，最近清理出一百三十吨左右的废碎钢材，供给小五金、文教用品制造厂生产日用品。
    过去广州有些大厂已用废碎材料支援了某些小五金制造厂的生产，但是这些厂之间尚缺乏固定的联系，因此废碎材料还没有被充分利用到生产上去。最近，为了充分发挥大厂支援小厂的作用，为日用工业品开辟更广泛的材料来源，中共广州市委物资清查领导小组办公室和广州市计划委员会组织有关工厂和市轻工业局、市废品公司一起开会，决定将过去积存下来的和今后生产过程中陆续产生的废料、碎料，尽量收集起来，支援日用工业品的生产。
    会后，市轻工业局立即组织力量分赴各大厂调查废料、碎料的情况，各厂也积极支持。例如，广州钢铁厂一年多来积存的钢坯切头等有八十五吨多，经加工成薄片或拉成丝以后，可以制造小锁、刀剪、指甲钳等多种日用工业品。这个厂便将这些废碎料全部调拨给轻工业局去安排生产。
    经过对十余个单位的初步清查，共有一百三十吨左右的废碎材料可以支援制造日用工业品。市轻工业局已将调拨来的材料分配给制造小锁、农具、缝纫机零件、指甲钳、布伞、刀剪等产品的数十座工厂使用。还有小部分正在调拨的材料将供给制造文教用品、发夹、灯嘴等产品的工厂。
    目前，广州市轻工业局除组织十余座工厂对这些废旧碎料进行辘片和拉丝等加工工作外，正在和机电工业局、冶金工业局签订协议，固定和有关大厂的联系，同时将扩大联系面，和一些中小厂也建立这种供应关系。
    市计委和市生产委员会最近也规定：各工厂企业现存的和在生产过程中产生的各种废次钢材、针棉织品下料、废旧纸类、废旧玻璃、旧木料、废旧橡胶、废旧塑料等，大部分或全部调拨给轻工业局、手工业局，或由市废品公司回收供应生产部门，并且要把供应关系固定下来，签订协议，以保证首先满足日用工业品的需要。
