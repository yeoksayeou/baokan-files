    Shenyang, July 1 (By our reporter) - The industrial production departments in Shenyang are seizing the opportune moment to actively organize and arrange production for the third quarter, ensuring the fulfillment of the plan and achieving a bumper harvest in industrial production.

    Judging from the plans that have already been compiled, Shenyang's industrial production tasks for the third quarter remain very heavy, with production tasks for many factories increasing significantly compared to the second quarter. For example, the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, which is responsible for manufacturing supporting equipment for power stations and large-scale mining electrical appliances nationwide, has a production plan for the third quarter that is almost double that of the second quarter. The Shenyang Transformer Factory, which holds an important position in the country for the production of large-scale transformer equipment, has a slightly lower product capacity planned for the third quarter than the second quarter, but the products are mostly large and complex transformer equipment; the number of man-hours required to manufacture one is equivalent to making one and a half in the past. There is also a large increase in small hardware, daily-use light industrial, and chemical products. Shenyang arranged the production of more than 400 varieties in the second quarter, and this will reach more than 1,000 varieties in the third quarter.

    In order to ensure the smooth completion of the third-quarter tasks and produce more and better products to supply the needs of national production and construction and the people's lives, since late June, the Shenyang Municipal Industrial Bureaus have continuously held various professional meetings to arrange and deploy the third-quarter production tasks and discuss and study common production problems. Factories that have already received their tasks have made timely arrangements and deployments to quickly implement the plans. The Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, which arranged its tasks earlier, organized workshops to discuss third-quarter production as early as mid-June and formulated specific measures to ensure the completion of the plan. In addition to formulating a corresponding quarterly technical organizational measures plan based on the third-quarter tasks, the Shenyang Chemical Plant further formulated a specific measures plan for July, specifying the completion date and person in charge for each measure.

    In arranging and organizing the third-quarter production, all factories have listed improving product quality as an important content. The Shenyang Transformer Factory has decided to make improving product quality a central task in July and to further organize and implement the new process specifications formulated and revised by cadres, technicians, and workers together based on production needs in June among the masses.

    沈阳各厂措施具体干劲更大
    本报沈阳1日电　沈阳市工业生产部门抓紧时机，积极组织安排三季度生产，确保计划完成，在工业生产上来个大丰收。
    从目前已经编订的计划来看，沈阳市第三季度工业生产任务仍然很繁重，不少工厂的生产任务都比第二季度有很大增加。像担负全国电站和大型矿山电器配套设备制造任务的沈阳高压开关厂，三季度生产计划比二季度提高了将近一倍。以生产大型变压设备在全国占有重要地位的沈阳变压器厂，从三季度计划生产的产品容量来看，比二季度略有降低，但产品多是大型结构复杂的变电设备；制造一台需要的工时量，相当过去做一台半的。在小五金和日用轻工和化工产品方面也有很大增长，二季度沈阳安排生产的品种共有四百多种，三季度将达一千多种。
    为了确保第三季度任务的顺利完成，生产出更多更好的产品供应国家生产建设和人民生活需要，从6月下旬以来，沈阳市各工业局就连续召开各种专业会议，安排、布置三季度生产任务，讨论研究共同性的生产中的问题。已经接到任务的工厂都及时的作了布置安排，使计划迅速落实。任务安排较早的沈阳高压开关厂早在6月中旬就组织各车间讨论了三季度生产，并订出了保证完成计划的具体措施。沈阳化工厂除了根据三季度任务制订出相适应的季度技术组织措施计划外，还进一步订出了7月份的具体措施计划，把每项措施都规定了实现日期和负责人。
    各个工厂在安排组织第三季度生产中，都把提高产品质量列为重要内容。沈阳变压器厂已经确定在7月里把提高产品质量作为一项中心工作，把在6月份，由干部、技术人员、工人共同根据生产需要制定和修订出的新工艺规格，在群众中进一步组织贯彻。（附图片）
