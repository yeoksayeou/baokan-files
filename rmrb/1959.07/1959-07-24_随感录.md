    Writing is for Others

    It is said that there was a great European writer who had a peculiar habit: he never sat down to write. When asked why, he replied: sitting is too comfortable, and if I write, I write too long. Standing makes my legs tired easily, so I have to write short pieces. To write shorter, I stand.

    Now we write articles that are always too long, and newspapers repeatedly call for opposing "verbosity." Why is there so much "verbosity"? Is it perhaps because we are all writing while sitting down?

    The length of an article has little to do with sitting or standing, of course. The crux of the matter lies elsewhere. I recently read "Selected Philosophical Works of Feuerbach," which contains a very good passage about writing. It says: "People do not write for themselves, but for others. At least I myself can never write anything for myself. What I write must be directly for someone or for humanity. Therefore, I try to write as clearly and concisely as possible. I do not want to cause trouble for others."

    Writing is for others, which is not a profound or difficult principle to understand, but we often forget it. Once we forget it, "clarity and conciseness" depart from us, and "verbose and redundant words" flow from our pens involuntarily, which adds endless trouble for others.

      Read More, Revise More

    After writing an article, read it more, revise it more, squeeze out some moisture, remove some dross, make the long shorter, and the rough finer. In China, there were many great writers in the past who were very serious about writing. Ouyang Xiu was one of them. It is said that he would revise each article several times. Once, after writing an article, he pasted it on the wall and read it every day, revising a few sentences or a few words as he went along. Over time, after repeated revisions, almost none of the original words on the first draft remained, all were changed.

    Now we don't all write articles so seriously. Often, after writing an article, we just look at it once and we are done. Sometimes we don't even look at it once before sending it to the newspaper and magazine editors. Editors naturally feel a headache when they receive such manuscripts. Many obvious mistakes are everywhere: typos, incorrect words, inaccurate citations of materials, and incorrect numbers. Editors certainly have a responsibility to check the cited materials and correct errors, but shouldn't writers also learn from Ouyang Xiu, read their finished manuscripts several times, and revise them several times? This is not an overly demanding request, is it?

    随感录

    写作是为别人
    据说欧洲有个大文豪，他有个古怪脾气，就是写文章从不坐着。人问其故，答说：坐着太舒服，写文章一写就长。站着容易腿累，写文章非写短不可。为了写得短些，所以站着写。
    我们现在写文章一写就长，报纸上一再提出反“繁文”。“繁文”为什么如此之多，莫非因为都是坐着写的缘故吗？
    文章的长短与坐着写或站着写关系当然不大。问题的症结另有所在。最近读“费尔巴哈哲学著作选集”，其中有一段谈到写文章的话，讲得很好。他说：“人们不是为自己，而是为别人写作。至少我自己绝不能给自己写东西。我所写的必须是直接地为某一个人或者给人类写的。所以我尽可能写得明白简洁。我不愿给别人增加麻烦。”
    写作是为别人，这本来不是什么高深难懂的道理，可是我们常常忘掉。一旦忘掉，“明白简洁”就离我们而去，“繁词冗语”就情不自禁地由笔下滔滔流出，这就给别人添了无穷的麻烦。
      多看看，多改改
    文章写好之后，多看看，多改改，挤掉一些水分，去掉一些渣滓，使长的变短，使粗的变精。中国过去的大文学家，写作认真的人很不少。欧阳修就是一个。据说他每写一篇文章总要修改几遍。他有一次写成一篇文章之后，贴在壁上，每天读一遍，随手改上几句或几个字，日子久了，改来改去，原来初稿上的字几乎一个不留，全改了。
    我们现在写文章不都是这么认真。往往一篇文章写出来，再复看一遍就完事了。有时候连一遍也没有看就送到报刊编辑部去。当编辑的人对于这样的稿子自然感到头痛。许多显然的错误到处都是：别字、错字、引用资料、数字不确实。当编辑当然有责任查对引用的资料、纠正错误，当作家是不是也应当学学欧阳修，对自己写好的稿子多看几遍，多改几遍，这总不算是苛刻的要求吧。
