　　On-site Processing, Transporting Finished Products
　　Saving Transportation Resources, Improving Timber Utilization
　　(Our Dispatch) In the course of the increase production and practice economy campaign, the Greater Khingan Mountains Forestry Bureau in Inner Mongolia is vigorously promoting timber production, aiming to process all suitable logs into finished timber on-site before transportation. From the beginning of January to mid-June, the thirteen small and medium-sized timber mills have already processed nearly 200,000 cubic meters of railway sleepers, squared timber, and planks.
　　This approach offers two major benefits for the bureau. First, it saves transportation resources and increases transport efficiency. According to relevant departments' calculations, transporting logs after processing them into railway sleepers, squared timber, and planks can save half the number of train cars. Second, the remaining edgings and sawdust from processing can be used as raw materials for the forest products industry, to produce activated carbon, fiberboard, and other products, thereby increasing timber utilization.
　　Because of these benefits, the Greater Khingan Mountains Forestry Bureau has decided to process all suitable logs into finished timber for transportation in the second half of the year. The measures include: the existing thirteen timber mills will vigorously increase equipment utilization and launch a socialist labor emulation campaign centered on technological innovation to improve labor productivity. Additionally, fifteen circular saw teams will be added to expand the old factories and build five new simple circular saw timber mills. The sixty circular saws needed for these fifteen circular saw teams are being manufactured at an accelerated pace; the twenty-six 80-horsepower tractors used to drive the circular saws have already been transferred from logging and other processes. Five timber mills using large band saws are also under construction.
　　The sawdust and edgings remaining from processing logs have already begun to be utilized. Thirteen small activated carbon plants have used sawdust to produce more than fifty tons of activated carbon. Edgings have also been used to produce fiberboard and wood wool board. (Attached picture)

### 就地加工　外运成材  可以节约运输力量，可以提高木材利用率

    就地加工　外运成材
    可以节约运输力量，可以提高木材利用率
    本报讯　内蒙古大兴安岭林业管理局在增产节约运动中，大抓制材生产，要把可以加工的原木都就地制成成材外运。从1月份开始到6月中旬为止，十三个中小型制材厂已经加工出枕木、方材和板材近二十万立方公尺。
    这个局采取这种作法有两大好处。一是可以节省运输力量，提高运材效率。据有关部门核算，原木加工成枕木、方材和板材运出，可以节省一半车皮。第二，加工剩下的边材、锯末等可以作为林产工业的原料，用以制成活性炭、纤维板等产品，提高木材利用率。
    因为有这样的好处，大兴安岭林业管理局决定在下半年把可加工的原木都加工成成材外运。措施是：原有的十三个制材厂大力提高设备利用率，开展以技术革新为中心以提高劳动生产率为目的的社会主义劳动竞赛。并要增加十五个圆锯工组，用以扩充老厂和新建五个圆锯简易制材厂。这十五个圆锯工组需要的六十台圆锯正在加紧制造；带动圆锯用的二十六台八十马力的拖拉机，已经从集材等工序调出来。五个用大带锯生产的制材厂也正在加紧修建。
    加工原木剩下的锯末、边材，已经开始利用。十三个小型活性炭厂，已用锯末生产出五十多吨活性炭。边材也制出了纤维板和木丝板。（附图片）
