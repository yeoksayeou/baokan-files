Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: Speech by Polish Ambassador to China, Kirillov, at the reception celebrating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Polish People's Republic.

    Respected Vice Chairman Comrade! Your Excellencies: Dear Comrades and Friends!
    Today, all Polish people are celebrating the joyous fifteenth anniversary of national and social liberation.
    Fifteen years ago, the Soviet army fighting against the Hitlerite bandits, together with the Polish army, set foot on Polish soil and liberated Poland from the shackles of Hitlerite enslavement.
    In the past fifteen years, our people have completed tremendous transformations in the political, economic, and cultural fields.
    Our people have carried out land reform and the nationalization of industry, thereby eliminating the exploiting classes and building a socialist, modern, and advanced country on the ruins of what was once a backward, landlord-capitalist country.
    Fifteen years after the founding of the country, People's Poland is stronger than at any time in its thousand-year history.
    Compared with the pre-war period, total industrial output has increased fivefold. We have also achieved great successes in agriculture, education, culture, and improving the people's living standards.
    We should thank the correct policies of the Polish United Workers' Party, and the Polish workers, peasants, and working intellectuals for achieving these accomplishments. In the great work of socialist transformation in our country, our people have received assistance from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all friendly people's democratic countries.
    For many years, the Polish People's Republic has developed close, and often very sincere, trade, cultural, and political cooperation with many countries outside of Europe that share our common goal of defending world peace. Here, I need only mention the visits of high-ranking officials from India and Indonesia, cooperation in the Korean and Vietnamese International Supervisory and Inspection Commissions, or joint actions in the United Nations.
    In our foreign policy, the Polish government and all our people resolutely oppose all conspiracies by warmongers attempting to revive German militarism, and we warmly support the resolution of the Berlin issue and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The Polish government's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe aspires to promote the easing of international tensions and promote peaceful coexistence among nations.
    In the past fifteen years, the people of China and Poland have embarked on the path of fraternal cooperation for the first time in their history. Constantly growing economic and cultural exchanges, as well as the common struggle for lasting peace, are manifestations of this cooperation.
    The Polish people express the highest admiration for the heroic Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its theorists and strategists—Comrade Mao Zedong—the Chinese people have liberated themselves from domestic feudalism and the oppression of foreign imperialists.
    The Chinese revolution and the great achievements made in the economic, social, and cultural fields over the past decade have made the People's Republic of China today a great force in defending peace and defending the freedom and sovereignty of other countries. The new and creative forms adopted by Chinese comrades, namely the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, which are unprecedented in history in rapidly and completely changing the face of China, have aroused widespread attention and praise.
    On our joyous festival, the Polish people most sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people further achievements in the creative work of building a happy future.
    I propose a toast:
    To the eternal friendship and fraternal cooperation between the people of Poland and China,
    To the friendship and fraternal cooperation of the great family of socialist countries,
    To the smooth work of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong,
    To the health of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,
    To lasting peace and friendly cooperation among all nations,
    Cheers!

    在波兰大使庆祝国庆招待会上
    基里洛克大使的讲话
    新华社22日讯　波兰驻中国大使基里洛克在庆祝波兰人民共和国建国十五周年招待会上的讲话。尊敬的副主席同志！诸位阁下：亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    今天，全体波兰人民在庆祝民族和社会获得解放的欢乐的十五周年。
    十五年前，同希特勒匪帮作斗争的苏军和同它在一起的波兰军队，踏上了波兰的土地，把波兰从希特勒奴役的枷锁中解放了出来。
    在十五年间，我国人民完成了政治、经济和文化方面巨大变革。
    我国人民进行了土地改革和工业国有化，从而消灭了剥削阶级，并且在曾经是落后的、地主资本家的国家的废墟上建设了社会主义的现代化的先进的国家。
    在建国十五年后，人民波兰比在自己千年历史上的任何时候都更加强大。
    和战前时期比较，工业总产量增长了五倍。在农业、教育、文化和提高人民生活水平方面，我们也获得巨大的成绩。
    获得这些成就，我们应该感谢波兰统一工人党正确的政策，感谢波兰的工人、农民和劳动知识分子。在我国进行社会主义改造的伟大工作中，我国人民获得了苏联、中华人民共和国以及所有的友好的人民民主国家的帮助。
    波兰人民共和国多年来和许多同我们有着保卫世界和平这一共同目标的欧洲以外的国家发展亲密的、而经常是非常真诚的贸易、文化和政治的合作。这里我只需提一下印度和印度尼西亚的高级人士的访问，在朝鲜和越南国际监督监察委员会中的合作，或者是在联合国里的共同行动等就够了。
    在我们的外交政策中，波兰政府和我国全体人民坚决地反对企图复活德国军国主义的战争挑拨者的一切阴谋，我们热烈支持解决柏林问题和缔结对德和约。波兰政府提出在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议，渴望以此来促进国际紧张局势的缓和，促进各国间的和平共处。
    在过去十五年里，波中两国人民在自己的历史上第一次踏上了兄弟般合作的道路。不断增长着的经济和文化交流以及为争取持久和平而进行的共同的斗争，是这种合作的表现。
    波兰人民对英勇的中国人民表示最高的钦佩。中国人民在中国共产党及其理论家和战略家——毛泽东同志的领导下，从本国的封建主义和外国帝国主义者的压迫下解放了自己。
    中国的革命和十年来在经济、社会和文化方面所获得的伟大成就，使中华人民共和国今天成为保卫和平，保卫其他国家的自由与主权的巨大力量。中国同志所采用的新的创造性的形式，即在历史上空前迅速地完全地改变中国面貌的大跃进和人民公社，引起普遍的注意和赞扬。
    在我们欢乐的节日里，波兰人民最衷心地祝兄弟般的中国人民在建设幸福的未来的创造性的工作中获得进一步的成就。
    我建议：
    为波中两国人民的永恒友谊和兄弟般的合作，
    为伟大的社会主义国家的大家庭的友谊和兄弟般的合作，
    为中国人民、中国共产党及其伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的工作顺利，
    为中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志的健康，
    为各国人民之间的持久和平和友好合作，
    干杯！
