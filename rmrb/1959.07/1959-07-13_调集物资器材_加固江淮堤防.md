Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 12th -- Anhui Province is vigorously carrying out flood prevention preparations in the areas along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers.

At present, more than 33,000 specialized teams for rescue, patrol, pile driving, transportation, and communication have been established in various places. All dangerous sections of dikes and dams, as well as culvert gates, are now under the care of dedicated personnel. Many project management sections and pond and reservoir management committees have been restored and improved. Recently, each special county in the province has also dispatched 925 inspection teams and more than 19,000 cadres to go deep into various places to inspect flood prevention work, identify problems, and solve them on the spot. More than 2,000 mass hydrological observation stations have also been built. There are more than 2,700 trained farmer hydrological forecasting observers in the province participating in observation work. These observation stations, together with the national observation stations, constitute a complete observation network.

Under the principle of "self-reliance, with self-financing as the main approach," various localities have raised a large number of flood prevention materials and equipment, such as wooden piles, sacks, reeds, rice straw, wheat straw, rubble, jute materials, kerosene lanterns, and gas lamps, and transported them to designated dike sections in succession. In addition, various localities have recently transferred more than 260,000 laborers to reinforce dangerous sections, planning to complete more than 4.43 million cubic meters of earth and stone work during the summer repairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th -- Since the beginning of summer, the water level of the Yangtze River has continued to rise and has now entered the flood season. Wuhan City is actively inspecting and reinforcing embankments, preparing materials and equipment, and stepping up flood prevention preparations.

At present, along the 274-kilometer-long embankment line in the city, flood prevention teams from various districts are conducting inspections and appraisals section by section. Wuchang, Jiang'an, and other districts have conducted several embankment inspections. When Jiang'an District discovered cracks in the embankment during the inspection, it immediately organized forces to repair them, and many embankment sections and breaches have been repaired and restored. Other districts and sections have also promptly repaired and reinforced weak sections during the inspection.

The sluice gates and yellow soil needed for the channel gates along the river have also been prepared in succession. A large number of flood prevention materials prepared by relevant departments are being organized for transfer.

In order to strengthen the leadership of flood prevention preparations, flood prevention command organizations have been established in various districts. Recently, the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee also held a meeting, requiring all districts along the river to strengthen flood prevention preparations and further inspect and repair embankments to ensure a safe passage through this year's flood season.

    新华社合肥12日电　安徽省沿长江、淮河地区大力开展防汛准备工作。
    目前各地已建立起抢险、巡逻、打桩、运输、通讯等专业队三万三千多个。堤防上所有的险工要段、涵闸斗门现在都有专人看管，许多工程管理段、塘坝闸库管理委员会都恢复和健全起来。最近全省各专县还派出了九百二十五个检查组、一万九千余干部深入各地检查防汛工作，发现问题，就地解决。群众性的水文观测站也已经建起了两千多处。全省参加观测工作、经过训练的农民水文预报观测员有两千七百多人，这些观测站配合国家观测站构成了一个完整的观测网。
    在“自力更生，自筹为主”的原则下，各地筹集了大量木桩、麻袋、芦柴、稻草、麦草、块石、麻料、马灯、气灯等防汛器材，陆续运往指定堤段。另外，各地最近还抽调了二十六万多劳力突击加固险工险段，计划完成夏修土石方四百四十三万余公方。
    新华社武汉12日电　入夏以来，长江水位不断上涨，现已进入汛期，武汉市正积极检查和加固堤防，准备物资器材，加紧进行防汛准备工作。
    目前，在全市长达二百七十四公里的堤防线上，各区的防汛队伍都在逐段的进行检查、鉴定。武昌、江岸等区都进行了几次堤防检查。江岸区在检查中发现堤围有裂缝现象时，就随即组织力量进行修整，许多堤段和缺口都已补救修复。其他各区、段在检查中也都及时对薄弱堤段进行了加修加固。
    沿江沿河通道闸口需用的闸板和黄土也都已陆续准备齐全。有关部门准备的大批防汛器材，正在组织调运。
    为了加强对防汛准备工作的领导，各区都已先后成立了防汛指挥机构。最近，武汉市人民委员会还召开会议，要求沿江各区加强防汛准备，进一步检查维修堤防，以保证安全度过今年的汛期。
