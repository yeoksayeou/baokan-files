"Accounting faction" is another name for "conservative faction." We do not approve of the "accounting faction" and must oppose them. But not because they demand "accounting," but because they adopt a conservative attitude towards things. If we only talk about "accounting," we not only do not object, but also very much agree, agreeing to calculate accounts all the time, everywhere, in everything, both big and small accounts together, and every account must be calculated. If we don't calculate accounts, we won't be able to build socialism, or socialism will suffer losses. Doesn't the socialist economy have a law of development called "planned and proportional development"? How to make plans, how to be proportional? In simple terms, it can be summarized as: to calculate accounts realistically according to needs and possibilities.

Every account must be calculated, which means that as long as it is related to building socialism, no matter which line or industry you are in, whether it is the whole country, a factory, or a people's commune, you must calculate accounts everywhere, and calculate them accurately and meticulously.

Let's use a factory as an example. Before building a factory, we need to calculate many accounts: First, we need to calculate whether the things the factory will produce in the future are needed in the overall industrial production plan of the country, the province, or the city? Is this variety needed, or another variety? Is more needed, or less? Because the whole country is a chessboard, this is a chess piece in it, and whether this piece should be played or not, and how to play it, must be calculated clearly. Second, we need to calculate all the ins and outs of the factory's future production, such as the resources, raw materials, equipment, transportation, labor force, technical strength, and even the market absorption of products needed for production. If this account is not calculated clearly, there may be endless troubles, the burden will become heavier and heavier, and even lead to collapse. Third, there is also a large account to be calculated for various designs and calculations in basic construction.

As for after the factory is built and put into production, there are not only issues of product output, quality, and output value, but also issues of production cost, labor productivity, etc., and it is even more necessary to calculate accounts all the time, everywhere, and in everything, so there is no need to mention it.

But I have found that, although not a majority, there are some comrades who do not calculate accounts much, but are running factories. Can a factory be run well if it is run without calculating accounts? I really break a sweat for these comrades.

Let's take a rural people's commune as an example again. The places where accounts should be calculated will not be less than those in a factory. The eight-character charter for increasing agricultural production, I think every word has a large account to be calculated. Taking only the first word "soil" in the eight characters, there is a lot to be calculated. First, calculate it one piece of land at a time. How much land does the whole commune have? Of all the land in the commune, how much is cultivated, and how much is uncultivated? Of the cultivated land, how much is fertile land, how much is barren land, what is the soil quality, what is suitable for planting, and how to improve it? Of the uncultivated land, how much is arable, and how much is unarable? Is there any wasteland that can be reclaimed? How much can be reclaimed, and how much cannot be reclaimed? What kind of land cannot be reclaimed: is it mountain land, depression land, sandy land, or other land? Is there still any possibility of utilizing these lands, how to utilize them, and how much benefit can be gained after utilization? ... Just this one word "soil" is enough for us to calculate accounts for a lifetime, because what we need to calculate is not only the past and the present, but also the future for many years to come. Land is the basic means of production for agricultural production, and the food and clothing parents of farmers. All production plans start from calculating accounts for the land. If the land account is not calculated clearly, then nothing can be discussed.

But I have also found that, although not a majority, there are some comrades who do not calculate accounts much, or are not good at calculating accounts, or are unwilling to calculate accounts. They are very enthusiastic about running people's communes, loyal but just don't like to calculate accounts. The characteristics of people's communes are "large-scale and public ownership." Calculating the number of households is as large as thousands or tens of thousands of households, and calculating the land is as large as tens of thousands of acres, or even hundreds of thousands of acres. Just this "large" size is enough for people to calculate its accounts, not to mention that it also has to be "public"? The relationship between public and private, including production, distribution, exchange, and many other issues, must be calculated in order to correctly handle them. Can a people's commune that is both large and public be run well if accounts are not calculated, or calculated less, or calculated unclearly? I think it is impossible, or at least very difficult.

Our general line is "go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." What is the "enough" in "go all out"? First of all, it is a question of quantity and degree; what is the "high" in "aim high"? "High" includes both quantity and quality; the "more" in "greater, faster, better, and more economical results" is the quantity of products, and "faster" is both the speed of production and can only be calculated with numbers; "better" is good quality, and the comparison of quality also depends on calculation; "economical" is saving, saving living labor and material consumption, which requires even more accounting. The general line of building socialism is, in the final analysis, nothing more than a general account of building socialism. Not only is it necessary to calculate accounts for building socialism, but it will also be necessary to calculate accounts for building communism in the future. Didn't Marx say that bookkeeping is more important than ever in communist society?

Therefore, I advocate that anyone who is determined to build socialism, whether they are workers, farmers, businessmen, students, or soldiers, must learn to calculate accounts and be a capable housekeeper. Calculating accounts is not for conservatism, but for leaping forward. To leap forward, we must calculate the accounts clearly and accurately. Isn't the movement to increase production and practice economy currently being carried out? Increasing production requires accounting, and so does practicing economy.

How to calculate accounts? First of all, we must start from politics. Starting from politics means starting from the interests of socialism and the interests of the people: First, we must calculate in detail and completely; second, we must calculate truthfully and accurately; third, we must calculate the near and also the far; fourth, we must calculate both big and small accounts.

Perhaps someone will ask: Isn't political leadership required in work? If everyone is buried in calculating accounts, who will take care of politics? I say: As long as it starts from the interests of socialism and the interests of the people, it is an account that is beneficial to socialism and the people, and it is indeed calculated well, then that is political leadership.

### 要学会算账

专栏：

    要学会算账
    “算账派”是“保守派”的别名。我们不赞成“算账派”，要反对他们。但并不是因为他们要求“算账”，而是因为他们对事情采取保守态度。如果只谈“算账”，我们不但不反对，而且很赞成，赞成时时算账，处处算账，事事算账，大账小账一齐算，有账必算。如果不算账，就会建不成社会主义，或者使社会主义遭受损失。社会主义经济，不是有一条发展规律，叫“有计划地按比例地发展”么？怎么订计划，怎么按比例呢？简单一句话可以说完：就是要按照需要与可能，切切实实地算账。
    有账必算，这就是说，只要是和建设社会主义有关系的，不论你是哪一行，哪一业，不论是全国也罢，一个工厂、一个人民公社也罢，处处都得算账，而且算得精，算得细。
    用一个工厂来打比方吧。在建厂之前，就要算许许多多的账：第一要算一算，这个工厂将来所要生产的东西，在全国、全省或全市的整个工业生产计划中需要不需要？需要的是这个品种，还是另一个品种？需要得多，还是需要得少？因为全国一盘棋，这是棋中的一颗棋子，这棋子该下不该下，如何下法，都得算清楚。第二要算一算，这个工厂未来生产上的一切来龙和去脉，例如生产所需要的资源、原材料、设备、运输、劳动力、技术力量以至产品的市场消纳等等。不算清这笔账，就可能后患无穷，包袱越背越重，以至垮台。第三，基本建设中的各种设计和计算，也有一大笔账要算。
    至于建厂之后，开工生产，既有产品的产量、质量、产值问题，又有生产的成本、劳动生产率等等问题，更要时时算账、处处算账、事事算账，那就不用提它了。
    但是我发现，虽不是多数，却有那么一些同志，不大算账，却在办着工厂。办工厂而不算账，能不能把工厂办好呢？我实在替这些同志捏着一把汗。
    再用农村人民公社来打个比方，该算账的地方，也不会比工厂少。农业增产的八字宪法，我看每个字都有大笔的账要算。只拿八个字中的第一个字“土”来说，就大有可算的账，先一块地一块地算一遍，全公社究竟有多少地？全社的地，已耕的是多少，未耕的是多少？已耕地之中，肥地多少，瘦地多少，土质如何，宜种何物，如何改良？未耕地之中，可耕的地多少，不可耕的地多少，有无荒地可以开垦？能开垦的是多少，不能开垦的是多少？不能开垦的是些什么地：是山地、洼地、沙石地还是其他的地？这些地还有没有利用的可能，如何利用，利用以后又能收益多少？……单凭这个“土”字，就够我们算一辈子的账，因为我们要算的，不止是算过去和现在，而且还得算到未来的多少年去。土地是农业生产的基本生产资料，是农民的衣食父母。一切的生产计划，就从土地算账算起，不把土地账算清楚，就一切都谈不上。
    但是我也发现，虽不是多数，却有那么一些同志，不大算账，或者不善于算账，或者不愿意算账，他们办人民公社挺热心，忠心耿耿就是不爱算账。人民公社的特点是“一大、二公”，算户数大到几千户、万多户，算土地大到几万亩，甚至十几万亩，单凭这个“大”，就够人大算其账了，何况还得“公”？公和私的关系，包括生产、分配、交换等等许多问题，要想正确地处理它们，就得算账。不算账，或少算账，或算账算得不清楚能不能把一个又大又公的人民公社办好呢？我想，是不可能的，至少很困难。
    我们的总路线是“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”。什么是“鼓足干劲”的“足”？首先就是个数量和程度问题；什么叫“力争上游”的“上游”？“上游”既包含数量，也包含质量；“多快好省”的“多”，是产品的数量，“快”既是生产的速度，也只能用数来计算；“好”是质量好，而质量的好坏比较，也得凭计算；“省”是节约，节约活的劳动和物资消耗，那就更需要算账。建设社会主义的总路线，说到底，无非是建设社会主义的一篇总账。不但建设社会主义要算账，将来建设共产主义也还是要算账的。马克思不是说过到了共产主义社会，簿记比任何时候都重要吗？
    所以我主张，有志于建设社会主义的人，无论为工、为农、为商、为学、为兵，都要学会算账，做一个精明强干的当家人。算账不是为了保守，而是为了跃进。要跃进，就要把账算清楚，算得确确实实，现在不正在开展增产节约运动吗？增产要算账，节约也要算账。
    算账怎么算法呢？首先要从政治出发。从政治出发，就是要从社会主义的利益出发，从人民的利益出发：一要算得细，算得全；二要算得真，算得确实；三要算近，还要算远；四要算大账也要算小账。
    或许有人问：作工作不是要政治挂帅吗？都埋头算账去了，谁管政治呢？我说：只要是从社会主义利益、人民群众的利益出发，是有利于社会主义和人民群众的账，而且确确实实算好了，那就是政治挂帅。
