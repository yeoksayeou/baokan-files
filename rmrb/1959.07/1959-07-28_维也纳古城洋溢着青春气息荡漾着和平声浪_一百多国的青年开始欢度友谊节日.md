    一百多国的青年开始欢度友谊节日
    据新华社维也纳26日电　本社记者杨翊报道：第七届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节正式揭幕。在开幕仪式之前代表们举行了盛大的游行。壮大而健美的队伍充分显示了全世界青年要求和平和友谊的诚挚心愿，也显示了他们保卫和平的坚定意志和巨大力量。
    26日当地时间十七时，来自一百多个国家的一万多名青年代表从维也纳国际博览会前面整队出发，沿着几里路长的宽敞的林荫大道向联欢节开幕会场维也纳中央运动场前进。大道两旁早拥塞着特地赶来观光的人群。
    这天，维也纳天气晴朗，气候宜人。游行的队伍由打着联欢节旗帜和五彩锦旗的摩托车队和乐队前导，接着是高执联欢节旗帜和参加国国旗的仪仗队。紧跟着手挽花篮的少女后面的是从斯堪的纳维亚到南非，从远东到美洲的一万多黑种、黄种和白种青年，穿着自己民族的节日盛装，载歌载舞，携手前进。但见彩旗招展，鲜花飞舞。“友谊”、“和平”、“自由”的欢呼声响彻云霄，使古老的维也纳顿时变得生气蓬勃起来。
    在游行行列中，社会主义国家的青年队伍博得最多掌声。
    游行持续了两个多小时。
    十九点半游行队伍全部进入了维也纳中央运动场。
    据新华社维也纳26日电　本社记者沈一鸣、席林生报道：第七届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节开幕式于十七时三十分（当地时间）在维也纳中央运动场隆重举行。会场布置得庄严朴素，看台四周一百二十个参加国的国旗在迎风飘扬，主席台上悬挂着巨大的联欢节会徽，两旁是“为了和平和友谊”的标语。
    十七时三十分，响起了七下宏亮的钟声，宣告第七届联欢节开幕的庄严时刻来临。这时，游行的队伍已经在来运动场的路上。运动场上联欢节筹委会的委员们登上了主席台，接受了一群奥地利少年的献花。
    十九时半举行入场式。
    各国代表的入场引起了五万多观众狂热的欢呼。几万只手臂不停地挥动，人们用各种不同的语言高喊着“友谊”、“和平”，整个会场浸沉在欢乐和友谊的海洋中。这时，会场上放出了一万只象征和平和友谊的鸽子。国际青年联欢节委员会代表、意大利社会主义青年联盟主席巴尔扎莫首先致词。接着五大洲的青年代表讲话，向维也纳和来自各国的青年们致节日的祝贺和友谊的问候。会上还宣读了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫给第七届联欢节的贺词。之后，奥地利政府代表哈洛普卡发言，他以政府名义表示欢迎第七届联欢节开幕。维也纳市副市长斯拉维克也在会上讲了话。
    讲话完毕，开始盛大的文艺演出。在音乐声、有节奏的掌声和“和平、友谊”欢呼声中，联欢节的旗帜冉冉上升。苏联、波兰、中国、阿根廷、伊拉克歌舞团都参加了演出。然后是一千二百名捷克斯洛伐克运动员表演。
    按照联欢节的传统，最后放了焰火，变幻无穷的节日礼花升向天空，深蓝色的维也纳夜空被火花照得灿烂光明。开幕式胜利地结束了。青年男女手挽着手，尽情地歌唱着离开会场，他们欢唱和平和友谊的歌声沿着蓝色的多瑙河，飞过葱翠的阿尔卑斯山传向遥远的地方。（附图片）
