According to the Heilongjiang Daily, the broad masses of workers in Harbin's three major power plants – Boiler, Motor, and Turbine – are determined to continue to exert greater effort, deepen the production increase and thrift campaign centered on high quality and high yield, and produce more and better power station equipment to greet the tenth anniversary of National Day.

The characteristic of Harbin Boiler Plant's third-quarter production is that there are more auxiliary machines to produce, the workload is large, and the task is heavy. In order to complete the third-quarter task, this factory has held various professional meetings since late June to deploy and arrange the third-quarter production tasks, and many workshops have formulated specific measures to ensure the completion of the plan. In order to solve the problem of insufficient pipe material, in addition to further tapping potential and clearing existing inventory materials, a professional group headed by the chief engineer, composed of personnel from process, design, and materials departments, was formed to adopt measures such as substitution to break through the material barrier. All the factory's cutting workers launched a "clever tailor" movement to achieve clever cutting and making, and to save materials.

When arranging the third-quarter plan, this factory regarded improving product quality and strengthening enterprise management as important contents of the third-quarter work. The specific measures are: to further determine the basic systems such as product quality standards, product inspection standards, and production rules, according to processing procedures, by variety, and by component; at the same time, it also organizes cadres, technicians, and workers to jointly formulate and revise new rules and regulations according to production needs.

The workers of Harbin Motor Factory are also advancing victoriously. On the basis of summarizing and inspecting the completion of the first-half plan, this factory deeply discussed the third-quarter plan, focusing on improving product quality, increasing varieties, striving for high yield, practicing strict economy, and improving labor productivity, and put forward many rationalization proposals and technical organization measures. The task of this factory in the third quarter is very heavy. In order to ensure the completion of the third-quarter task, it was decided to launch a production increase and thrift campaign centered on strengthening technical management, improving product quality, rectifying production order, and improving the responsibility system. In this movement, it is necessary to carry out "three checks" (check thinking, check responsibility, check safety), "three determinations" (determine process, determine system, determine measures), and three comparisons (compare quality, compare high yield, compare savings), organize workers to study operating procedures and safety regulations, strengthen the political and technical education of new workers, conscientiously implement quality inspection regulations, improve product quality, and ensure safe production.

The third-quarter production task of Harbin Turbine Factory increased by more than double compared with the second quarter, the task of new products is very large, and the variety of products also increased from one in the second quarter to five, and the quality requirements are stricter. In view of this situation, this factory studied the third-quarter plan several times in June, and determined to take improving product quality as the center, carry out a production increase and thrift competition around high quality, high yield, reducing costs, and ensuring safe production, and resolutely overfulfill the national plan.

At present, a great battle to seize high quality and high yield is being fully launched in the three major power plants.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 7th: The Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened an enlarged meeting of the Municipal Committee to specifically deploy the industrial production tasks for the third quarter. The meeting required the workers of all factories and mines in the city to strive to improve product quality, increase varieties and designs, improve labor productivity, and reduce costs, and push the production increase and thrift campaign to a new climax, to greet the tenth anniversary of National Day with outstanding achievements in comprehensively completing the third-quarter production tasks.

In the first half of this year, all key factories and mines in Huangshi City completed their production plans; major industrial products such as steel, iron, coal, cement, iron ore, and electricity have reached more than 45% to 54% of the annual plan respectively, and product quality and labor productivity have been significantly improved, and costs have also been reduced. This has changed the situation of "loose at the beginning and tight at the end" in the implementation of the plan in previous years, and laid a foundation for continued leap forward in the second half of the year. At the same time, the enlarged meeting of the Municipal Committee pointed out that the production tasks of the city's factories and mines in the third quarter are very heavy, and the requirements for product quality and variety are higher and more numerous, and costs must also be greatly reduced. It is necessary to continue to exert greater effort in order to comprehensively complete the plan. Therefore, the Municipal Committee requires all factories and mines to continue to boldly mobilize the masses, comprehensively strengthen scientific management, and further push the production increase and thrift campaign to a new climax.

Now, all factories and mines have arranged the work for the third quarter according to the outstanding problems of their own units.

Daye Steel Plant decided to continue to improve quality as the center, and mobilize workers to carry out a movement of "everyone contributes ideas, everyone thinks of ways" to tackle key problems and break through key problems through forms such as detailed accounting, holding quality exhibitions, and organizing on-site visits and evaluations, so as to achieve a double leap forward in output and quality. At the same time, it was decided to vigorously promote new technologies, strengthen technical analysis and experiments, strengthen technical supervision, and improve product quality.

    行动坚决　措施扎实  力争三季度优质高产
    哈尔滨三大动力厂深入开展增产节约运动，黄石市乘胜前进力争超额完成三季度计划
    据黑龙江日报消息　哈尔滨锅炉、电机、汽轮机三大动力厂的广大职工决心继续鼓足更大干劲，深入开展以优质高产为中心的增产节约竞赛运动，生产出更多更好的电站设备，迎接国庆十周年。
    哈尔滨锅炉厂三季度生产的特点是：辅机生产多，工作量大，任务繁重。为了完成三季度任务，这个厂从6月下旬以来就召开了各种专业会议布置和安排三季度生产任务，许多车间都制订了保证完成计划的具体措施。为了解决管材不足的问题，除进一步挖掘潜力，清查现在库存材料外，还以总工程师为首，抽调工艺、设计和材料部门人员，组成解决材料问题的专业组，采取代用等办法，突破材料关。全厂下料工种开展了巧裁缝运动，作到巧裁巧作，节约材料。
    这个厂在安排三季度计划时，把提高产品质量，加强企业管理作为三季度工作的重要内容。具体措施是：进一步把产品质量标准、产品检验标准、生产守则等基本制度，按加工工序，分品种、分部件确定下来；同时，还组织干部、技术人员、工人根据生产需要共同制定和修订出新的规章制度。
    哈尔滨电机厂职工也在乘胜前进。这个厂在总结和检查完成上半年计划的基础上，深入讨论三季度计划，围绕着改进提高产品质量，增加品种，力争高产，厉行节约，提高劳动生产率，提出了许多合理化建议和技术组织措施。这个厂三季度的任务很重，为了确保完成三季度的任务，决定开展以加强技术管理，提高产品质量，整顿生产秩序，健全责任制度为中心的增产节约运动。在这个运动中要开展“三查”（查思想、查责任、查安全）、“三定”（定工艺、定制度、定措施）、三比（比优质、比高产、比节约），组织职工学习操作规程和安全规程，加强对新工人的政治和技术教育，认真贯彻质量检验规程，提高产品质量，确保安全生产。
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂第三季度生产任务比第二季度增长一倍多，新产品任务很大，产品品种也由二季度一种增加到五种，质量要求更加严格。根据这种情况，这个厂在6月份几次研究了三季度的计划，确定以提高产品质量为中心，围绕优质、高产、降低成本、确保安全生产开展增产节约竞赛运动，坚决超额完成国家计划。
    目前，一场争夺优质高产的大战正在三大动力厂全面展开。
    据新华社武汉7日电　中共黄石市委在最近召开了市委扩大会议，具体部署了第三季度的工业生产任务。会议要求全市各厂矿企业职工努力提高产品质量，增加品种花色，提高劳动生产率和降低成本，把增产节约运动推向新的高潮，以全面完成第三季度生产任务的出色成绩迎接国庆十周年。
    黄石市在今年上半年，全市重点厂矿都完成了生产计划；主要工业产品如钢、铁、煤、水泥、铁矿石和电力等，都分别达到全年计划的45％到54％以上，而且产品质量和劳动生产率都有显著提高，成本也有所降低。这就改变了历年执行计划前松后紧的形势，为下半年继续跃进打下了基础。同时，市委扩大会议指出，全市厂矿企业第三季度的生产任务很重，而且产品质量和花色品种要求更高、更多，还要大大降低成本。必须继续鼓足干劲，才能全面完成计划。因此，市委要求各厂矿要继续放手发动群众，全面加强科学管理，把增产节约运动进一步推向新的高潮。
    现在，各厂矿都根据本单位的突出问题，安排了第三季度的工作。
    大冶钢厂决定以继续提高质量为中心，发动职工通过算细账、举办质量展览会、组织现场参观和评比等形式，开展一个“人人献计策，个个想办法”的攻关键和破关键的运动，做到产量、质量双跃进。同时，决定大力推广新技术，加强技术分析和试验，加强技术监督工作，提高产品质量。
