A Grassroots-Admired People-Run Primary School Teacher
By our reporter Yao Di

“I must revolutionize on the teacher's post to the end!” This is the great ambition established by twenty-three-year-old primary school teacher Wu Zhijun, and it is also the firm belief he uses to spur himself on when encountering difficulties in his work.

From Accountant to Primary School Teacher

In the spring of 1958, a high tide of cultural revolution swept across the country. In Wu Fangying, a village of more than 160 households in Yanqing County, Hebei Province (now under the jurisdiction of Beijing), the masses requested the establishment of a people-run primary school. To meet the urgent demands of the masses, the commune decided to add a first-grade class to the original public primary school. That is to say, in addition to the original fifty students, thirty-four new students would be added. As long as the masses have enthusiasm and everyone thinks of some ways, the classroom problem is relatively easy to solve, but adding a teacher is very difficult. The treatment of the new teacher cannot be the same as that of a public primary school teacher who receives a monthly salary; the work of a primary school teacher is also very complex and specific. Who would be willing to take on this job? The commune cadres were a little worried and had to select from among the educated people in the village. At that time, the few educated people in the village either went out to work or were preparing to apply to become drivers. After picking and choosing, they finally selected Wu Zhijun, the accountant of the commune. This young man was a communist party member from a poor peasant background. When it comes to work, Wu Zhijun always has a drive, as if he is stuck to the job, and he doesn't stop until he does the job well. In his own words, "I can't let go if the work is not done well." In terms of education, although he only attended junior high school, he did not allow himself to stay at his original level. Due to his diligent study, he has now surpassed junior high school graduates. From any point of view, Wu Zhijun meets the requirements, except that his family life is more difficult. Wu Zhijun is the main labor force in the family, his second younger brother is in primary school, and there is an even younger brother, and his mother is over fifty years old. His father died of illness. However, Wu Zhijun never cares about his living conditions. Sure enough, when the commune cadres told Wu Zhijun about this decision, he happily accepted the task.

"Who Will Take Care of These Thirty-Odd Children?"

On the first day of class, Wu Zhijun encountered many difficulties. The children were of different ages, from a few years old to more than ten years old, all in the same class. These children had always been used to staying at home, and they were not used to sitting in class or listening to the teacher. The classroom was noisy and chaotic, making it impossible to teach. Wu Zhijun, sweating, barely managed to persuade one child, but another child started to make trouble. How anxious he was at the time! He thought: When will I be able to manage this group of children! He finished a day of class tiredly and returned home. As soon as he lay down on the bed and closed his eyes, he immediately remembered the gossip he heard during the day: "Being mixed up with little kids all day long, you can't even see an adult." Wu Zhijun thought and carefully savored these words: "Are they right? The Party says something different. The Party tells us: Education is the work of cultivating people, it is a glorious cause, and we must cultivate the flowers of the motherland one by one into people with socialist consciousness, who love labor, and are cultured." The more Wu Zhijun thought about it, the more confident he felt, and his determination to be a primary school teacher became even firmer. Later, when people still gossiped about him, he would retort, "If I leave, who will take care of these thirty-odd children?" Seeing his strong sense of responsibility, others no longer dared to make fun of him. On the contrary, they regarded him as a respectable person and secretly praised him.

Wu Zhijun found that the class he was teaching was very chaotic, so he divided the children in the class into two parts according to their age. The older children sat together, and the younger children sat together, all in the same classroom. When the older children had class, the younger children buried their heads in their homework; when the younger children had class, the older children did their homework. The order was well-maintained. Wu Zhijun taught and supervised the students' homework all by himself, advancing on all fronts. Wu Zhijun called this: multi-grade teaching. I asked him, "Will this kind of class interfere with each other?" He said, "As long as it is arranged well, there is no impact. You may not be able to do your homework well at home." After this arrangement, the children gradually developed study habits.

The order of study was quickly established. But how to make the masses believe that people-run schools can also teach students well? Wu Zhijun specially formed a study group with six older children in the class, using their spare time to help them review their lessons every day, and also helped them arrange their household labor. He also used his own hard study and practice experience to encourage the children to move forward. In this way, the six older children made particularly rapid progress, completing the entire first-grade curriculum in just four months. After the summer vacation, they all entered the second grade of Wu Fangying Public Primary School. Wu Zhijun's work achievements were praised by parents and students.

Concurrent Adult Spare-Time School Teacher

For a period of time, the adult spare-time school in the village lacked teachers, so they asked Wu Zhijun to serve as the teacher of the women's class. At that time, he taught first-grade primary school students during the day and taught women in the evening. He always worked diligently, and the more he worked, the more interested he became, and the higher his enthusiasm became. This time, when I visited Wu Zhijun, he told me that his main requirement was to study. He said, "Only by improving myself can I teach students well." No matter how busy he was with work, whenever there was a holiday, the primary school teachers in the county would gather to study and listen to reports. Wu Zhijun always rushed to participate and was never absent. The vast majority of teachers participating in this kind of study were from public schools, and very few were from people-run schools. Wu Zhijun has his own views on this issue. He believes that as a people-run school, in terms of teaching students well, it should be on par with public schools. If it cannot achieve this, the masses will not believe in people-run schools.

Wu Zhijun never forgets to absorb the experience of others, improve his work, and constantly progress. This year, Wu Zhijun's people-run primary school has more first-graders promoted to the second grade of public primary schools. The teachers of those public schools also respected him very much when they saw his high sense of responsibility for his work. Now, whether it is the masses or his colleagues, they all affectionately call him "people-run teacher."

Difficult Experience

Speaking of the past of Wu Zhijun, the son of a poor peasant, everyone in this village knows it. Now, Wu Zhijun is so selfless for the sake of the children, which is inseparable from his past. Wu Zhijun helped his family with work since he was a child and did not study for many days. After liberation, the family was allocated land, but due to the large population and small labor force, it was still relatively difficult. At that time, although Wu Zhijun enrolled in school, he still had to help his family with a lot of work, and he barely managed to finish junior primary school. Should he attend senior primary school? Wu Zhijun was very conflicted. He certainly wanted to study, but his father was sick and unable to work, and his mother had to take care of his younger brothers. If he studied, the family's livelihood would be a problem. At the same time, the complete primary school was far from home, and there were no conditions for boarding; if he commuted, he would have to walk a long way back and forth every day. Thinking about it, there were so many difficulties that Wu Zhijun simply had no confidence to continue studying. But then he thought again, if he graduated from senior primary school in two more years, he would have culture and be able to do more work. The Party helped him, and the original teacher also encouraged him to continue studying. After ideological struggle, Wu Zhijun decided to continue his hard work for two more years. He helped his family with work and studied. Studying was even more difficult than before. In this way, Wu Zhijun overcame numerous difficulties with his strong will and completed senior primary school.

Wu Zhijun has gone through this road so arduously and gloriously. He will continue to go on, giving play to his greater talents and contributing to the cause of people's education. (Attached picture)

    一个群众爱戴的民办小学教师
    本报记者　姚堤
    “我一定要在教师岗位上革命到底！”这是二十三岁的小学教师吴志君立下的大志，也是他在工作中遇到困难时用来鞭策自己的坚定信念。
    从会计到小学教师
    1958年的春天，全国掀起了文化革命高潮。河北省延庆县（现属北京市）吴方营这个一百六十多户的村子，群众纷纷要求成立民办小学。为了满足群众的迫切要求，公社决定在原来的公立小学里增办一班一年级。就是说除了原有的五十名学生，还要增加三十四名新生。只要群众有热情，大家想些办法，课堂问题还比较容易解决，要增加一个教师，却很困难。新教师的待遇不能和公立小学教师一样每月拿薪金，只能由社里以中等劳动力一样分得工分；小学教师的工作又是非常复杂、具体的工作。谁愿担任这个工作呢？社干部们有点伤脑筋了，他们只好在村子里有文化的人中间去挑选。当时村里数得出的几个有文化的人，不是出外干活去了，就是正准备投考司机。挑来挑去，最后他们挑中了社里的会计吴志君。这个小伙子是个贫农出身的共产党员。论工作，吴志君总有那么一股劲儿，就像粘在工作上一样，不干好工作不停止。用他自己的话说：“工作没干好，我就放不下。”论文化，他虽然只读过高小，可是，他不让自己停在原有的水平上。由于他的刻苦钻研，现在已经超过高小毕业生了。从哪一方面说，吴志君都合条件，就是他的家庭生活比较困难一些。吴志君是家中的主要劳动力，他的二弟正在上小学，还有一个更小的兄弟，母亲已经五十多岁了。父亲病死了。可是，吴志君从来不计生活待遇。果然，当社干部把这个决定告诉了吴志君，他就愉快地接受了这个任务。
    “这三十多个孩子交给谁”
    第一天上课，吴志君就遇到了许多困难。孩子们年龄大小不一，从几岁到十几岁，都在一个班里上课。这些孩子又一直是在家呆惯了的，他们都不习惯坐着上课，也不肯听老师的话。课堂里乱嘈嘈地，根本没法上课。吴志君流着汗好容易劝住了这个孩子，可是那个孩子又闹起来了。当时他是多么焦急呀！他想：我什么时候才能管好这群娃娃啊！他疲倦地上完了一天课，回到家里。当他刚躺到炕上闭上眼睛的时候，立刻想起了白天有些人的闲话：“整天和小娃娃搅在一起，连个大人也见不着。”吴志君一面想一面细细回味这些话：“他们说的对吗？党同他们可说的不一样。党告诉我们：教育工作是培养人的工作，是光荣的事业，要把祖国的花朵一个个培养成为有社会主义觉悟，爱劳动、有文化的人。吴志君越想越觉得有信心，做小学教师的决心也更加坚定了。以后，当人家还跟他说闲话的时候，他就反问人家说：“我走了，这三十多个孩子交给谁？”别人见他事业心这样强，再也不敢取笑他了，相反，认为他是一个可尊敬的人，暗地里都称赞他。
    吴志君发现自己教的那个班很乱，就把班上的孩子根据年龄大小分成两部分，年龄大一点的孩子坐在一起，年龄小的坐在一起，都在一个教室里。大孩子上课，小孩子就埋着头作作业；小孩子上课，大孩子作作业，秩序井然。吴志君一个人又上课又督促学生作作业，齐头并进，吴志君把这叫做：复式教学。我问他：“这样上课，是不是会互相干扰？”他说：“只要安排好，就没有影响。回家作作业，倒不一定能作好呢。”这样安排以后，孩子们就慢慢地养成学习习惯了。
    学习秩序很快建立起来了。可是，怎样让群众相信民办学校也能教好学生呢？吴志君把班上六个年龄较大的孩子专门组成了一个学习组，利用空闲时间天天帮助他们温习功课，也帮助他们安排家庭劳动。他还用自己苦学苦练的经历，鼓励孩子们前进。这样，六个大孩子的学习进度特别快，在短短四个月中，学完了一年级的全部课程。暑期以后，他们都升入了吴方营公立小学二年级。吴志君的工作成绩，得到了家长们和学生们的称赞。兼任成人业余学校教师
    有一个时期，村里的成人业余学校缺少老师，他们就请吴志君去担任妇女班的老师。那时，他白天教一年级的小学生，晚上教妇女们。他总是勤勤恳恳地干着，并且越干越有兴趣，越干积极性越高。这次，当我访问吴志君的时候，他告诉我，他的主要要求，就是学习。他说：“只有提高自己，才能教好学生。”不管工作怎样忙，每逢假日，县里的小学教师们集中学习、听报告，吴志君每次都是赶着去参加，从不缺席。参加这种学习的教师绝大多数是公立学校的，民办教师很少。吴志君对于这个问题，有他自己的看法。他认为作为民办学校，在教好学生这一点上，应当向公立学校看齐，做不到这一点，群众就不相信民办学校了。
    吴志君从不忘记吸取别人的经验，改进自己的工作，不断进步。今年吴志君办的民办小学，有更多的一年级生升到公立小学二年级。那些公立学校的教师看到他对工作那种高度的责任感，也都非常敬重他。现在，不管是群众或同行的人，都亲切地称他为“民办教师”。
        艰苦的经历
    谈起贫农儿子吴志君的过去，这个村子的老老少少都是知道的。现在，吴志君这样不计较一切地为着孩子们，是和他的过去分不开的。吴志君从小就帮家中干活，没有念几天书。解放以后，家里分了地，但是由于人口多，劳动力少，还是比较困难。那时候，吴志君虽然入了学，但是还要帮助家中干很多活，好容易咬着牙才把初小念完了。念不念高小呢？吴志君很矛盾，自己当然很想念，但是父亲有病不能劳动，母亲还要照顾弟弟们，要念书，家里的生活成问题。同时完小离家很远，住校没有条件；走读吧，天天来回要走很多路。想来想去，困难那么多，吴志君简直没有信心再念下去了。但是他又转念一想，再念两年高小毕业了，自己有了文化，也就可以做更多的工作。党帮助他，原来的老师也鼓励他继续念下去。经过思想斗争，吴志君又决定再艰苦奋斗两年。他一面帮家中干活，一面学习。学习比以前更艰苦了。就这样，吴志君用他坚强的毅力，克服了重重困难，念完了高小。
    吴志君就是这样艰苦而光荣地走过了这一段道路。他还要继续走下去，发挥自己更大的才智，贡献给人民教育事业。（附图片）
