Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 20th: According to a report by Antara News Agency today, Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio delivered a lengthy speech to officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In his speech, he discussed Indonesia's foreign policy.

Subandrio pointed out that Indonesia's active and independent foreign policy is conducive to Indonesia's construction. He said that we must oppose imperialism in accordance with the will of the people and adopt a hostile attitude towards it. We must unite with countries that oppose imperialism and stand with them.

He said that we must seek friendship among Asian and African countries, even though the governmental systems of these countries may differ.

He also said, "In order to seek material benefits, we cannot disregard good-neighborly policies, and therefore cannot rashly adopt a hostile attitude towards those neighboring countries that participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

When talking about the West Irian issue, Subandrio said, "We must transform the defensive strategy into an offensive strategy." The goal of the new strategy is to create a situation at home and abroad "that makes the Netherlands feel that it has no choice but to hold negotiations with us." He said that some foreign countries have expressed strong reactions to the measures taken by Indonesia in the economic field. With the exception of socialist countries, most countries cannot agree with the measures taken by Indonesia. Some countries not only scold Indonesia, but also threaten it.

Subandrio said that many countries have not legally recognized the People's Republic of China, but it is a country of practical importance.

When talking about the rebellion in Indonesia, he said that without foreign support, there would have been no rebellion in Indonesia at all. Indonesia is also facing difficulties from foreign subversion activities. He said that those countries that play an important role in this regard are demanding that Indonesia abandon its active and independent policy.

    印度尼西亚外长发表演说
    重申执行独立的外交政策
    新华社雅加达20日电　据安塔拉通讯社今天报道，印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约对外交部官员发表了长篇演说。他在演说中谈到印度尼西亚的外交政策。
    苏班德里约指出，印度尼西亚所执行的积极和独立的外交政策有利于印度尼西亚的建设。他说，我们必须按照人民的意愿反对帝国主义，对它采取敌视态度，我们必须同反对帝国主义的国家团结一致，并且同他们站在一边。
    他说，我们必须在亚非国家中寻找友谊，虽然这些国家的政府制度可能各不相同。
    他还说，“为了谋求物质利益，我们不能不顾睦邻政策，因此不能轻率地就对那些参加东南亚条约组织的邻国采取敌对态度”。
    苏班德里约在谈到西伊里安问题时说，“必须把守势战略转为攻势战略”。新的战略的目标是要在国内外造成这样的局面：“使荷兰感到不得不同我们举行谈判”。他说，有些外国对印度尼西亚在经济方面所采取的措施表示了强烈的反应。除了社会主义国家，大多数国家都不能同意印度尼西亚所采取的措施。有些国家不仅骂印度尼西亚，而且对它进行威胁。
    苏班德里约说，许多国家还没有在法律上承认中华人民共和国，但是它是一个具有实际重要性的国家。
    他在谈到印度尼西亚的叛乱问题时说，要不是有外国的支持，印度尼西亚根本就不会发生叛乱。印度尼西亚还遭到外国颠复活动的困难。他说，那些在这方面扮演重要角色的国家要求印度尼西亚放弃它的积极和独立的政策。
