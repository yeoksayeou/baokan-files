Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, 2nd. TASS reported: The Latin American Labor Union issued a statement on the situation in the Dominican Republic, calling on all trade union organizations in Latin America to support the Dominican people's struggle against dictatorship.

The statement condemned the brutal repression by the Dominican dictator Trujillo against the residents.

The statement said that hundreds of people have been killed or wounded in agricultural areas, especially in the Constanza area, due to government bombings. Citizens are being massacred in large numbers, and Bernardino, commander of the government's eastern cavalry, has ordered the brutal elimination of those who oppose Trujillo. The dictatorial regime's appalling methods are primarily targeted at workers and peasant masses.

In addition to calling on Latin American trade union organizations to support the Dominican people, the Latin American Labor Union also called on the United Nations and other international organizations to stop the Dominican government's massacres of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, 2nd. The Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies recently passed a resolution expressing support for the Dominican people who are engaged in the struggle against dictatorship. The resolution has been submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee for action.

The resolution was made based on the motion of parliamentarian Amílcar Gómez, who said when proposing the motion that Trujillo's dictatorship in the Dominican Republic was "caused by the North American Marines." He cited as an example that at the Pan-American Conference held in Caracas in 1954, Dulles planned actions against the democratic regime of Guatemala, and Trujillo stated that "if the aggression supported by international trusts fails," he was prepared to take sole responsibility for taking aggressive actions.

Xinhua News Agency, San José, 2nd. The Costa Rican Parliament recently passed a motion condemning the United States for using the "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance" signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1947 to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries.

In a letter to the Venezuelan Parliament, the Costa Rican Parliament said that this so-called mutual assistance treaty, which is claimed to be a tool for defending peace in the hemisphere, is instead being used to prevent the people of various countries from realizing their determination for freedom and becoming a tool for maintaining dictatorial regimes, a practice that "should be condemned by the democratic conscience."

The Costa Rican Parliament expressed its deep concern over the fact that this treaty, which was supposedly concluded to prevent international conflicts, is currently being used as a tool to interfere in the internal affairs of Nicaragua, hindering the Nicaraguan people's struggle for freedom and supporting the despotic regime.

    拉丁美洲劳工联盟发出号召
    支援多米尼加人民反独裁斗争
    委内瑞拉和哥斯达黎加议会谴责美国干涉拉丁美洲事务
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城消息：拉丁美洲劳工联盟就多米尼加共和国局势发表一项声明，号召拉丁美洲的所有工会组织声援多米尼加人民的反独裁斗争。
    声明谴责多米尼加特鲁希略独裁者对居民采取的残酷镇压手段。
    声明说，由于政府滥施轰炸，在农业地区，特别是在康斯坦萨地区，有数百人伤亡。公民大批地被屠杀，政府东部骑兵部队司令伯尔纳丁诺下令残酷消灭反对特鲁希略的人。专制政权骇人听闻的手段首先是针对工人和农民群众。
    拉丁美洲劳工联盟在声明中除了号召拉丁美洲的工会组织支援多米尼加人民以外，并且呼吁联合国和其他国际组织制止多米尼加政府对人民的大规模屠杀。
    新华社2日讯　加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉众议院不久前通过一项决议，表示支持进行反独裁斗争的多米尼加人民。这项决议已被提交外交委员会以便采取行动。
    这项决议是根据议员阿米耳卡·戈麦斯的动议作出的，戈麦斯在提出这项动议时说，特鲁希略在多米尼加共和国的独裁，是“北美的海军陆战队造成的”。他举例说，在1954年于加拉加斯举行的泛美会议上，杜勒斯策划了对付危地马拉民主政权的行动，而特鲁希略就表示，“如果国际托辣斯出钱支持的侵犯失败的话”，他准备负责单独采取侵犯行动。
    新华社2日讯　圣约瑟消息：哥斯达黎加议会最近通过一项动议，谴责美国利用1947年在里约热内卢签订的“泛美互助条约”来干涉拉丁美洲国家的内政。
    哥斯达黎加议会在给委内瑞拉议会的信件中说，这个所谓互助条约被说成是保卫这个半球和平的工具，但是它却被利用来阻止各国人民实现自由的决心，变成为维护独裁政权的工具，这种做法“应该受到民主良心的谴责”。
    哥斯达黎加议会表示，它对以下这个事实感到深切不安：据说是为了防止国际冲突而缔结的这个条约，目前却被当成一种工具，用来干涉尼加拉瓜内政，妨碍尼加拉瓜人民争取自由的斗争和支持专制政权。
