The biology faculty and students of Central China Normal College in Wuhan recently held five consecutive scientific discussion meetings to discuss the two issues of "Species Change" and "Intraspecies Relationship, Interspecies Relationship."

At the meeting, it was generally believed that changes in species are caused by changes in living conditions, which is also one of the basic principles of the Michurin school. However, there were many differing opinions when applying this principle to solve species problems. For example, some comrades believed that phenomena such as wheat producing rye, rye producing "hua mai" (花麦 - Fagopyrum tataricum), and oats producing green grass were not governed by any rules. Other comrades believed that although we cannot yet reveal the reasons for some species variations caused by living conditions, we must not say that they lack objective regularity. When discussing how a species will transform into another species and whether there are intermediate types in the transformation process, the debate was very heated. Some comrades believed that this is accomplished by both leaps and gradual changes; in nature, the emergence of new species mainly relies on gradual changes, and leaps only occur under special conditions. In the process of transforming from one species to another, there are intermediate types. Comrades who disagreed with this view believed that a species can only complete the transformation through leaps. There can also be no intermediate types in the transformation between the two.

    华中师范学院生物系讨论物种关系问题
    武汉华中师范学院生物系师生，最近连续举行了五次科学讨论会，就“物种的变化”和“种内关系、种间关系”两个问题展开了讨论。
    在会上，大家认为物种的改变，是由于生活条件的改变引起的，这也是米丘林学说的基本原则之一。但在运用这个原理解决物种问题时，就有不少分歧的意见。例如，小麦产生黑麦、黑麦产生花麦、燕麦产生青草等现象，有些同志认为是没有规律可循的。有些同志则认为，由于生存条件所引起的物种变异现象，有些我们今天虽还不能揭示其原因，但决不能说它们是没有客观规律性的。讨论到一个物种将变为另一物种究以何种方式来完成的，在转变过程中有无中间类型的问题时，争论十分热烈。有些同志认为，这是由飞跃和渐变两种形式来完成的；在自然界中，新种的产生主要是依靠渐变的形式，飞跃的形式只是在特殊的条件下才发生。在由一个物种转变为另一个物种的过程中，有中间类型。不同意这种看法的同志认为，一个物种只能用飞跃的形式来完成转变。在两者的转变过程中也不能存在中间类型。
