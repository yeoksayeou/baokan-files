    China's coal industry is undergoing a comprehensive Great Leap Forward, and coal mine workers across the country are doing everything possible to mine more and better coal for the country, in order to ensure that the national economy continues to leap forward and meets the ever-increasing demand for coal. Coal mine workers across the country must muster their energy and resolutely fulfill the glorious tasks entrusted to them by the Party and the state.
    In the first half of this year, the production of various industries in China has greatly increased compared with the same period last year, and the production of more and better products will be achieved in the second half of the year than in the first half. This requires more coal as fuel and raw materials; at the same time, half of the second half of the year is winter, and the amount of coal for civilian use will also increase sharply. In order to ensure the continued leap forward of industrial and agricultural production and the coal needed for people's livelihood in the second half of the year, while coal mine workers across the country are working hard to mine more and better coal, it is also necessary to do everything possible to vigorously conserve coal.
    According to preliminary investigations by some departments, there is great potential for conserving industrial and civilian coal; in particular, the metallurgical industry, the power industry, and the railway transportation industry, which use the most coal, have even greater potential for conservation. For example, the coke ratio of small blast furnaces this year has been greatly reduced compared with last year, which is a great progress. However, the issue of saving coke has not been paid attention to by personnel in all local iron and steel enterprises. In the second quarter, small blast furnaces in Wuxi City used an average of just over three tons of coal to produce one ton of iron, while small blast furnaces in many other places consumed more coal than this. In some places in Heilongjiang and other places, the coke ratio of small blast furnaces is more than twice as high as that in Jiangsu and other regions. This disparity in coal consumption shows that there is great potential for local metallurgical industries to conserve coal. The Ministry of Railways also made great achievements in saving coal in previous years. From 1950 to 1957, the reduction was more than 10% for three years, and 3.4% to 4.7% for four years. However, the effectiveness of saving coal last year and this year is not as good as in previous years. Therefore, the railway department should vigorously strengthen the work of saving coal. The power industry has always attached importance to saving coal. For many years, the power industry has regarded coal consumption quotas as an important indicator for assessing the completion of state plans by each thermal power plant. However, the power industry also has the potential to reduce coal consumption, especially to burn more low-quality coal and save good coal. The relatively large coal consumption of some enterprises and frequent changes in coal types, as well as the poor quality of some coal, are related to objective reasons. However, the main reason is that some cadres do not pay attention to or do not pay as much attention to saving coal as before. In terms of civilian coal, according to a survey of 209 canteens of government agencies in Beijing, canteens with more than 500 people used an average of 0.96 jin of coal per person per day, with the most using 2.3 jin and the least using 0.44 jin. The one using the most coal used four times as much as the one using the least. It can be seen from the above situation that there is great potential for conservation, whether it is industrial coal or civilian coal.
    In order to do a good job in saving coal, the management cadres of various enterprises and agencies must fully understand the great significance of saving coal at present, and conduct widespread publicity and education on saving coal among the masses. Enterprises with high coal consumption such as the metallurgical industry, the power industry, and railway transportation need to regard saving coal as an important task. Because the state provides these enterprises with sufficient coal, it is easy to ignore saving coal. However, these departments account for a very large proportion of the country's total coal consumption, and coal consumption also accounts for a large proportion of the production costs of these enterprises. This year, the metallurgical industry used more than 25% of the total amount of coal uniformly allocated by the state. Coal accounts for one-sixth of the cost of railway transportation, and accounts for more than 50% of the cost of thermal power generation and pig iron from small blast furnaces. Therefore, saving coal in these departments is very important for saving coal for the country, or for using the saved coal to increase production, or for reducing the production costs of these enterprises. The cadres and workers of these enterprises must regard saving coal as an important task in production. Although the coal used by some enterprises with less coal consumption and the living coal used by agencies, schools, and families accounts for a small proportion of the production cost or the expenses of the unit and family, the total amount of coal saved by each enterprise, agency, school, and family is a great material force. If the country only saves 5% of civilian coal, more than 2 million tons of coal can be saved in the second half of the year; this coal can be used to increase the production of 700,000 tons of pig iron.
    The focus of saving coal is still in industrial and transportation enterprises. All enterprises must strictly implement the quota system and management system for the consumption of raw materials and materials such as coal; all enterprises must formulate material supply plans based on the state-determined production plans and raw material and material consumption quotas.
    To vigorously save coal, effective measures must also be taken in terms of organizational leadership and technology. Liaoning Province recently organized cadres from planning departments, commercial departments, and coal industry departments to go deep into enterprises to check coal supply in batches, which is a very effective method. During the inspection, they suspended the supply of coal to enterprises with excessive coal storage according to the production plan, and immediately adjusted the supply for those whose production was affected due to unsuitable varieties or insufficient supply. This method of "checking, stopping, and adjusting" allows the planning department to both "know the actual situation" of the current coal consumption of each enterprise, and lay a good foundation for improving the varieties of coal allocated in the future and determining fixed supply relationships (which is very important for rational coal consumption); it not only promptly solved the problem of insufficient coal supply for a small number of enterprises and promoted production, but also unearthed a large amount of coal resources. Therefore, all departments and regions should also adopt this method recently to conduct a general inspection of industrial coal and civilian coal. Secondly, it is necessary to widely introduce and organize the promotion of advanced experiences in saving coal. China has accumulated a lot of good coal consumption experience in both industrial and civilian coal. Various departments should take effective measures such as holding on-site meetings and training stoker drivers to promote them universally. Efforts should be made to ensure that the vast majority of workers or housewives who burn coal understand and use advanced coal burning methods suitable for their adoption. The experience of small blast furnace ironmaking in Wuxi, Jiangsu and other places, which has good product quality and low coal consumption, should be seriously promoted. Some small blast furnaces should be technically transformed under possible conditions to reduce coke consumption. Those small blast furnaces with particularly low product quality and particularly high coke ratios due to objective or subjective conditions should stop production and arrange production according to the national plan after the conditions are met, so as to transfer the coke to those furnaces with low coke consumption and high pig iron quality, and produce more and better pig iron for the country. Transforming the stoves in canteens is one of the effective measures to save civilian coal. Due to the establishment of public canteens in rural areas, a large part of the country's civilian coal is used in collective canteens. At present, the stoves in many canteens consume a lot of coal. The canteen of a people's commune in the eastern suburbs of Beijing used to burn an average of one to two jin of coal per person per day, but after transforming the stoves using advanced methods, it was reduced to half a jin. Qingdao City universally transformed stoves last year, and the city now only needs an average of just over four liang of coal per person per day. Organizing the vast masses in rural areas to collect firewood and grass after autumn is also a positive and effective way to save coal, and all regions should treat this as an important task for caring for the people's lives and saving coal for the country. While taking the above measures, the relevant personnel in coal supply work should strive to improve their work and strengthen the planning of coal supply work to promote the production of various enterprises and the saving of coal.
    There must be indicators for saving, and the relevant central departments have initially proposed indicators for saving coal. These are the indicators for saving coal while ensuring the completion of the state production plan and the normal supply of civilian coal, and are the minimum saving indicators. These indicators proposed by the central departments need to be realized by each enterprise and the broad masses. Therefore, each enterprise, agency, and school should also specifically set out indicators and measures for saving coal. As long as everyone saves coal, we will definitely be able to use the coal produced this year to produce more and better products and promote the continued and continuous development of China's entire national economy.

    节约煤炭促进生产
    我国的煤炭工业正在全面跃进，全国煤矿职工正在千方百计地为国家多采煤，采好煤，以保证我国国民经济继续跃进对煤炭日益增长的需要。全国煤矿职工，必须鼓足干劲，坚决完成党和国家交给自己的光荣任务。
    今年上半年，我国的各种工业的生产都比去年同期有了很大的增长，下半年还将比上半年生产更多更好的产品。这就需要更多的煤炭来作燃料和原料；同时，下半年有一半的时间是冬季，民用煤的数量也将剧增。为了保证下半年工农业生产继续跃进和人民生活所需要的煤炭，在全国煤矿职工努力多采煤采好煤的同时，还必须千方百计地大力节约煤炭。
    根据一些部门的初步调查，节约工业用煤和民用煤都是大有可为的；尤其是冶金工业、电力工业和铁路运输业这些用煤最多的部门，节约的潜力更大。例如，今年小高炉的焦比比去年大大降低了，这是很大的进步。但节约用焦炭的问题还没有引起所有地方钢铁企业的人员重视。无锡市小高炉在第二季度平均三吨多一点煤炼一吨铁，而其它许多地方的小高炉耗煤量则超过此数。黑龙江等地有些地方小高炉的焦比比江苏等地区高一倍以上。这种耗煤量的悬殊，说明地方冶金工业节约煤炭大有可为。铁道部前几年节约用煤也是很有成绩的，从1950年到1957年，有三年都是降低了10％以上，有四年降低了3.4％到4.7％。而去年和今年节约煤炭的成效不如前几年。因此，铁路部门应当大力加强节约煤炭的工作。电力工业一向是重视节约用煤的。电力工业多年来都把耗煤定额当作考核每个火力发电厂完成国家计划的重要指标。但是，电力工业在降低煤耗量特别是多烧低质煤节省好煤方面，也还是有潜力的。有的企业用煤较多和煤的品种经常变动、有些煤的质量不好等客观原因有关。但是，有些干部思想上不重视或不如以前重视节约煤炭却是主要原因。在民用煤方面，根据北京市对二百零九个机关食堂的调查，其中五百人以上的食堂平均每人每天用煤零点九六斤，最多的是二点三斤，最少的是零点四四斤。用煤最多的比用煤最少的多用四倍。从上述情况中可以看出，不论工业用煤或民用煤，节约的潜力都是很大的。
    要作好节约煤炭的工作，各企业和机关的管理干部，必须充分地认识目前节约用煤的重大意义，并且普遍地对群众进行节约用煤的宣传教育。冶金工业、电力工业和铁路运输等用煤多的企业，需要把节约用煤当作一项重要的任务。由于国家对这些企业用煤供应充分，因此很容易忽视节约煤炭。而这些部门占全国用煤量的比重却非常之大，煤炭的消耗在这些企业的生产成本中也占着很大的比重。今年冶金工业用煤占全国统一分配的煤炭总量的25％以上。煤炭占铁路运输成本的六分之一，占火力发电和小高炉生铁的成本都在50％以上。因此，这些部门的企业节约煤炭，对于为国家节省煤炭，或用节省的煤炭来增加生产，或降低本企业的生产成本，都是非常重要的。这些企业的干部和工人群众，必须把节约煤炭当作生产中的一项重要任务。一些用煤比较少的企业和机关、学校及家庭的生活用煤，占生产成本的比重或占本单位和家庭的开支虽然很小，但每个企业、机关、学校和家庭节约的煤总合起来，就是很大的物质力量。全国只是民用煤如果节约5％，下半年就可以节约二百多万吨煤；这些煤就可以用来增产七十万吨生铁。
    节约用煤的重点仍在工业交通运输企业。各个企业必须严格执行煤炭等原料和材料消耗定额制度和管理制度；一切企业必须根据国家确定的生产计划和原料、材料消耗定额编制物资供应计划。
    大力节约煤炭，还必须从组织领导和技术方面采取有效措施。辽宁省最近组织计划部门、商业部门和煤炭工业部门的干部深入企业，分批进行检查煤炭供应情况，是个很有成效的办法。他们在检查中根据企业生产计划，存煤过多的就暂停供应煤炭，因品种不合适或供应不足影响生产的就立即调整供应，这种“边查、边停、边调整”的方法，可以使计划部门既对目前各企业用煤的实际情况作到了“心中有数”，又对改进今后分配煤的品种和确定固定的供应关系（这对合理用煤非常重要）打下了良好的基础；既及时地解决了少数企业煤炭供应不足的问题，推动了生产，又挖出了大量的煤炭资源。因此，各个部门和各地区，应该在最近也采取这种办法，对工业用煤和民用煤进行一次普遍检查。其次，要广泛地介绍和组织推广节约用煤的先进经验。我国在工业用煤和民用煤方面，都积累了很多很好的用煤经验。各部门应采取召开现场会议、训练司炉司机等有效措施，普遍地推广。要争取作到绝大多数烧煤的工人或家庭主妇都懂得和使用适合于自己采用的先进的烧煤方法。像江苏无锡等地产品质量好用煤少的小高炉炼铁的经验，应当认真推广。有些小高炉在可能的条件下要进行技术改造，以降低焦炭的消耗。那些由于客观条件或主观条件不具备而产品质量特别低、焦比特别高的小高炉，应该停止生产，等条件具备以后再根据国家计划安排生产，以便把焦炭调给那些用焦少生铁质量高的炉子，为国家生产更多更好的生铁。改造食堂的锅灶是节约民用煤的有效措施之一。由于农村成立了公共食堂，全国的民用煤有很大一部分是用于集体食堂。目前有许多食堂的锅灶费煤较多。北京市东郊一个人民公社的食堂原来每人每天平均烧一斤到二斤煤，采用先进的方法改造锅灶以后就减到了半斤。青岛全市去年普遍地改造了锅灶，全市现在每人每天平均只要四两多煤就够了。秋后发动农村广大群众打柴拾草，也是节约煤炭的积极有效的办法，各地应该把这当作关心群众生活和为国家节约煤炭的一件重要工作来做。在采取以上各种措施的同时，煤炭供应工作的有关人员，应该努力改进工作，加强煤炭供应工作的计划性，以促进各企业的生产和煤炭的节约。
    节约必须有指标，中央有关部门已经初步提出了节约煤炭的指标，这是在保证完成国家生产计划和民用煤正常供应的情况下节约煤炭的指标，是最低限度的节约指标。中央部门提出的这些指标，要靠每个企业和广大群众来实现。因此，每个企业和机关学校，也都应具体的定出节约煤炭的指标和措施。只要大家都来节约煤炭，我们就一定能用今年生产的煤炭，生产更多更好的产品，促进我国整个国民经济的继续不断地发展。
