Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 7th - Soviet scientists published articles in newspapers and periodicals on the 7th, commenting on the great significance of the Soviet Union's launch of a medium-range geophysical ballistic rocket.

The famous Soviet scientist Dobronravov wrote in an article published in the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" that Soviet science has taken another step in the cause of conquering outer space. Only the Soviet Union's first-stage rockets have the power to launch such a heavy object into the high altitude. The rocket weighs about the same as three "Moskvich" cars.

The upper atmosphere is the gateway to outer space. Scientists have long been interested in the light gases—hydrogen and helium—present in the upper atmosphere. These two gases have almost no molecules and atoms in the lower atmosphere, but they are abundant in interplanetary gas. In order to study the conditions of the upper atmosphere, which is adjacent to outer space, Soviet scientists installed special instruments on the rocket for the first time to carry out exploration.

Academician Dorodnitsyn of the Soviet Academy of Sciences pointed out in an article published in "Izvestia" that the part of the research program related to the study of the physiological functions of organisms when ascending to high altitude is particularly interesting. The flight of two dogs and a rabbit and their safe landing made it possible to obtain materials on the adaptation of organisms to extreme conditions such as hypergravity and weightlessness. The article said that scientists will obtain extremely extensive scientific materials from this launched ballistic rocket, some of which are essential for studying how to improve the reliability of long-distance radio communications and studying high-altitude flight conditions. Human knowledge about the upper atmosphere can be greatly enriched.

Corresponding Academician Mustel of the Soviet Academy of Sciences wrote in an article in "Izvestia" that the successful launch of the ballistic rocket is a new major contribution to Earth science and the science of the Earth's atmospheric structure, and a major contribution of Soviet science to the realization of the ambitious plan of the International Geophysical Year. Mustel wrote that studying the structure and composition of the high-altitude ionosphere is of great scientific significance. Direct study of the light gases that make up the ionosphere can provide a great deal of material about the ionosphere. According to the preliminary results of processing the materials obtained from this launched ballistic rocket, Soviet scientists have obtained data on the composition of light gases in the atmosphere for the first time.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 7th - The final stage of the first cosmic rocket and a replica of the sealed container of the cosmic rocket's head, which the Soviet Union successfully launched in January this year, have been on display at the Soviet National Economic Achievements Exhibition since the 5th for the first time. The vast audience has shown great interest in it.

The conical final stage of the cosmic rocket is 5.5 meters long and 2.6 meters in diameter, and weighs 1,472 kilograms after the reserved fuel is used up. The sealed container of the cosmic rocket's head is suspended in another hall. Its shape is spherical, and from the outside, it is similar to the Soviet Union's first artificial Earth satellite.

    苏联科学家评发射中程地球物理弹道火箭
    苏联又在征服宇宙方面迈进一步
    人类第一次获得有关大气中轻气体成分的资料
    新华社莫斯科7日电　苏联科学家7日纷纷在报刊上发表文章，评述苏联发射中程地球物理弹道火箭的巨大意义。
    苏联著名科学家多布隆拉沃夫在苏联“共青团真理报”上发表的一篇文章中写道，苏联科学又在征服宇宙空间的事业上迈进了一步。只有苏联的一级火箭才有力量把这样重的物体射到高空。火箭的重量约等于三部“莫斯科人”牌汽车。
    大气高层是宇宙空间的大门。科学家早就对大气高层存在的轻气体——氢和氦感到兴趣。这两种气体的分子和原子在大气低层几乎没有，然而却大量存在于行星际气体中。为了研究和宇宙空间为邻的大气高层的状况，苏联科学家在这次发射的火箭上第一次安装了有关的专门仪器，进行探测。
    苏联科学院院士多罗德尼秦在“消息报”上发表文章指出，在研究计划中有关研究生物在升入高空时的生理机能的那一部分，是特别有趣的。两狗一兔的飞行和它们的安全着陆，使得获得了有关生物适应超重和失重等非常条件的材料。文章说，科学家将从这次发射的弹道火箭上得到极为广泛的科学材料，其中有些材料是研究如何提高远程无线电联系的可靠性和研究高空飞行条件等所必不可少的。人类关于大气高层的知识又可以丰富不少。
    苏联科学院通讯院士穆斯捷利在“消息报”上撰文说，弹道火箭的成功发射，是对地球科学和地球大气结构科学的新的重大贡献，是苏联科学对实现国际地球物理年的宏伟计划的重大贡献。穆斯捷利写道，研究高空电离层的结构和成分有巨大的科学意义。直接研究组成电离层的轻气体可以获得许多有关电离层的材料。根据处理这次发射的弹道火箭所获得的材料初步结果表明，苏联科学家已经第一次获得了有关大气中轻气体的成分的资料。
    新华社莫斯科7日电　苏联今年1月发射成功的第一个宇宙火箭最后一级和宇宙火箭头部的密封容器复制品，5日起在苏联国民经济成就展览会上首次展出。广大观众对它发生了巨大的兴趣。
    这个圆锥形宇宙火箭最后一级长五点五米，直径二点六米，在储备的燃料用完后的重量为一千四百七十二公斤。宇宙火箭头部的密封容器被凌空悬挂在另一个大厅内。它的外形呈圆球形，从外表看来，近似苏联第一个人造地球卫星。
