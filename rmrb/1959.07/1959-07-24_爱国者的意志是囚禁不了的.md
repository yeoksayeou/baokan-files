    A Patriot's Will Cannot Be Imprisoned
    By Our Commentator
    News has come that the Greek authorities, in their madness, have disregarded the strong opposition of the Greek people and world public opinion, and have sentenced Glezozos to nine years of deprivation of freedom, eight years of deprivation of political rights, and other Greek patriots to heavy sentences ranging from five years to life imprisonment through a military tribunal. This is a shameless provocation against all patriotic people of Greece and the world's public who love justice and peace.
    The entire trial process of the Athens Military Tribunal exposed that this was nothing more than a political farce staged by the Greek reactionaries. First of all, the Athens Military Tribunal's trial of Glezozos and other Greek patriots was in itself a violation of democratic judicial procedures. The only decree it was based on was the so-called "Law 375," and everyone knows that this is a reactionary decree left over from the former fascist dictatorship in Greece to persecute Greek democratic progressive forces and patriots. In the post-war period, this fascist law has been opposed by the vast majority of the Greek people. Secondly, among the four people who appeared as so-called "prosecution witnesses," three were officers of the Greek police局. The main "witnesses," officers Papaspyropoulos and Sakellariou, were both hired by the Greek authorities to monitor and spy on Glezozos. More importantly, the allegations made by the court and the "prosecution witnesses" that Glezozos and others had committed so-called "espionage crimes" were completely unfounded, and the entire trial process has made this very clear. Even the main "witness" for the prosecution admitted in public, under the solemn questioning of the defendant's lawyers, that the Greek political police局 had no concrete evidence to prove that Glezozos and others had committed "espionage crimes." In this way, the "facts" fabricated by the Greek authorities were overturned one by one in court by the real facts and witnesses. However, in the end, the Athens Military Tribunal brazenly sentenced Glezozos and others to heavy sentences in full view of the people of the world. This can only show that the Greek authorities have fallen into a state of complete political and moral bankruptcy in this trial farce.
    The whole world has noticed that after all the arguments fabricated by the presiding judge of the Athens Military Tribunal to accuse Glezozos and others were exposed, he attempted to use the defendant's opposition to the establishment of rocket bases on Greek territory as "evidence of espionage activities." This ridiculous fallacy of the presiding judge was immediately refuted by the defendant's lawyers. However, it should be pointed out that this attempt by the presiding judge of the Athens Military Tribunal exposed the real reason why the Greek reactionaries wanted to persecute Glezozos and other patriots. The Greek authorities are intensifying their fascist reactionary rule at home, such as banning the Communist Party and some democratic organizations, restricting freedom of the press, and arresting and exiling patriotic democrats; externally, they are pursuing a treasonous policy of relying on imperialism and serving the United States' war adventurous plans. Recently, the Greek authorities, completely disregarding Greece's security interests, have even prepared to agree to the United States establishing missile bases on Greek territory. This anti-national, anti-people, and anti-peace policy pursued by the Greek authorities has aroused increasingly strong dissatisfaction and opposition from all sectors of the Greek people. It is very clear that the Greek authorities' sentencing of Glezozos and other Greek patriots to heavy sentences by despicable means is essentially to suppress the ever-rising desire of the Greek people for national independence, democratic freedom, and peace.
    However, the Athens Military Tribunal's barbaric verdict against the Greek national hero Glezozos and other patriots does not indicate the strength of the Greek reactionaries, but rather their cowardice. It was not the Greek reactionaries who triumphed in the military tribunal, but Glezozos and other imprisoned patriots. The righteous and awe-inspiring spirit they showed in court in their struggle for the cause of peace and democracy is respected not only by the Greek people, but also by the people of the world. The persecution of Glezozos and other patriots by the Greek reactionaries can only further arouse the anger of the Greek people and accelerate the reactionaries' march towards death.
    The Greek reactionaries thought that through the illegal verdict of the military tribunal, they could deprive Glezozos and other patriots of their freedom; but Glezozos's spirit can never be broken by any prison or shackles. This glorious flag raised by Glezozos on the Athens Acropolis still inspires the Greek people. All peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world will unswervingly sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Greek people for national dignity and the beautiful ideals of peace and democracy. We firmly believe that final victory will surely belong to the Greek patriots and the great Greek people.

    爱国者的意志是囚禁不了的
    本报评论员
    消息传来，希腊当局竟丧心病狂，不顾希腊人民和世界公众的强烈反对，通过军事法庭判处格列索斯以剥夺自由九年，剥夺政治权利八年，以及判处其他希腊爱国者五年以上直至无期徒刑的重刑。这是对希腊全体爱国人民和全世界热爱正义与和平的公众的无耻挑衅。
    雅典军事法庭的整个审讯过程暴露了这不过是希腊反动派所演出的一幕政治丑剧。首先，雅典军事法庭开庭审讯格列索斯等希腊爱国者这件事本身就是违反民主司法程序的。它所依据的唯一的法令是所谓“三七五号”法律，而谁都知道，这是希腊前法西斯专政时期遗留下来为了迫害希腊民主进步力量和爱国者的反动法令。战后时期，这一条法西斯法律一直为希腊广大人民所反对。其次，出庭充当所谓“原告证人”的四个人中竟有三个是希腊警察局的警官。主要“证人”警官帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯和萨凯拉里乌，都是被希腊当局雇佣来监视和侦察格列索斯的。尤为重要的是，法庭和“原告证人”所指控的格列索斯等人犯有所谓“间谍罪”，毫无事实根据，整个审讯过程已经非常清楚地说明了这一点。就连原告的主要“证人”在被告辩护人严正的质问下也当众承认，希腊政治警察局没有任何具体的证据足以证明格列索斯等人犯有“间谍罪”。这样，希腊当局所捏造的“事实”，在法庭上一个一个地都被真正的事实和证人推翻了。然而最后，雅典军事法庭居然在全世界人民的众目睽睽之下蛮横地判处格列索斯等人以重刑，这只能表明希腊当局在这一场审讯的丑剧中陷于政治上和道义上彻底破产的境地。
    全世界都注意到，雅典军事法庭的庭长在为指控格列索斯等人所捏造的一切论据被揭穿以后，曾企图以被告反对在希腊领土上建立火箭基地作为“进行间谍活动的证据”。这个庭长的愚不可及的谬论立即遭到了被告辩护人有力的驳斥。但是，应该指出，雅典军事法庭庭长的这种企图，倒是暴露了希腊反动派所以要迫害格列索斯及其他爱国者的真实原因。希腊当局在国内加紧法西斯的反动统治，如禁止共产党和一些民主组织、限制出版自由、逮捕和流放爱国民主人士；对外则奉行投靠帝国主义，为美国的战争冒险计划服务的卖国政策。最近，希腊当局甚至根本不顾希腊的安全利益，准备同意美国在希腊国土上建立导弹基地。希腊当局所奉行的这种反民族、反人民与反和平的政策已经引起希腊各阶层人民越来越强烈的不满和反对。非常明显，希腊当局用可耻的手段，对格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者判处重刑，实质上是为了镇压希腊人民不断高涨的民族独立、民主自由与和平的愿望。
    但是，雅典军事法庭对希腊民族英雄格列索斯及其他爱国者的野蛮的判决丝毫也不表明希腊反动派的强大，而是表明了他们的怯弱。在军事法庭上胜利的不是希腊反动派，而是格列索斯和其他被囚的爱国者。他们在法庭上所表现的为了和平与民主事业而斗争的正义凛然的气概，不仅为希腊人民，而且也为全世界人民所尊敬。希腊反动派对格列索斯及其他爱国者的陷害，只能更加激起希腊人民的愤怒，加速反动派走向死亡的过程。
    希腊的反动派以为通过军事法庭的非法判决，能够剥夺格列索斯和其他爱国者的自由；但是格列索斯的精神决不是任何牢狱和镣铐所能磨折的。格列索斯在雅典城堡上所竖起的这一面光辉的旗子仍然鼓舞着希腊人民。全世界一切爱好和平与自由的人民将始终不渝地同情和支持希腊人民为了民族尊严与和平民主的美好理想而进行的正义斗争。我们深信，最后的胜利一定属于希腊爱国者和伟大的希腊人民。
