Organizing Three Types of People to Summarize “Three Types of Fields”
Guihou Brigade Uses Early Rice丰产 Experience to Promote Late Rice Increase

Fuzhou, July 15 (this newspaper) -- Before the start of the summer harvest, Guihou Brigade of Yanxi Commune, Changtai County, Fujian Province, held an on-site observation meeting of three types of people (elderly, middle-aged, and young) and "three types of fields" (increased production fields, general fields, and backward fields). They summarized the early rice increase experience and formulated late rice increase measures, using summer to promote autumn and striving for a bumper late rice harvest.

The Guihou Brigade is located in a mountainous area. The brigade Party branch believes that this year's early rice has universally implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and the experience is very rich. Summarizing the increase experience of various fields and the lessons of yield reduction in certain fields, and applying them to late-season production, can promote a greater late-season harvest. Therefore, when the early rice was ripening, they mobilized the masses to select three types of fields: increased production, general, and reduced production. They also organized more than 30 representatives from old peasants, middle-aged people, young people, cadres, and technicians. They used methods such as on-site observation and listening to the field managers of each representative field introduce technical measures. They conducted in-depth inspections and evaluations of fields, piece by piece, and then conducted on-the-spot discussions and summaries at the fields. After returning, they further conveyed and discussed in production teams or production groups, driving members to summarize their own experiences and lessons and formulate late rice increase measures.

After carefully inspecting and evaluating various representative fields of the entire brigade, the representatives unanimously believed that as long as leadership is strengthened, the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural increase is earnestly implemented in accordance with local conditions, a greater autumn harvest can generally be achieved. For example, the Eighth Production Team has a third-class field with poor natural conditions, lean soil, and prone to waterlogging. Last year's yield was 250 jin per mu. This year, because the team's leadership went very deep, all increase measures were discussed with the masses, mobilizing everyone to improve drainage ditches, change series irrigation to rotational irrigation, increase accumulation and application of base fertilizer and top dressing, and implement rational close planting. As a result, the yield can be increased by more than double compared to last year.

As for the generally growing fields, most of them are caused by insufficient implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter." For example, although some implemented rational close planting, they only achieved normal production or a slight increase due to untimely top dressing or poor field management in the later stages.

After the representatives evaluated and identified various backward fields, they pointed out that the common characteristics of these backward fields were sparse planting, short ears and few grains, and most of them would have reduced production compared to last year. The main reasons are insufficient subjective effort, insufficient leadership, poor farming, and poor implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter." For example, a seven-mu second-class field in the Second Production Team did not earnestly implement the "Eight-Point Charter." The field was not harrowed evenly, less base fertilizer was applied, top dressing was delayed, and planting was wide. As a result, each mu yielded more than 100 jin less than an adjacent third-class field.

After the above-mentioned mass serious evaluation and identification, summarizing the experiences and lessons, greatly educated and encouraged the cadres and members, and formulated late-season increase measures centered on the implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter." In addition to formulating reasonable close planting specifications for late rice based on the different conditions of mountain fields, ocean fields, and individual rotten mud fields and deep water fields, they also focused on accumulating fertilizer and managing seedlings. They also decided to extract 40% of the labor force after the summer harvest and summer planting to go to the mountains to set up camps and accumulate and apply fertilizer on the spot, strengthen the management of remote fields, and strive for a greater late-season harvest.

    组织三种人总结“三种田”
    珪后大队以早稻丰产经验促晚稻增产
    本报福州15日电　福建省长泰县岩溪公社珪后大队夏收开始前，召开三种人（老年、中年、青年）、“三种田”（增产田、一般田、落后田）现场观摩会，总结早稻增产经验，订出晚稻增产措施，以夏促秋，力争晚稻大丰收。
    珪后大队地处山区。大队党支部认为今年早稻普遍贯彻农业“八字宪法”，经验十分丰富；把各种田地的增产经验和某些田地的减产教训总结起来，运用到晚季生产中去，就可以促进晚季更大丰收。因此在早稻黄熟时，即发动群众选择了增产、一般与减产的三种田，并组织了老农、中年、青年和干部、技术员代表三十多人，采用现场观摩和听取各代表田田间管理员介绍技术措施等办法，深入田间逐丘逐片进行检查评比，而后就地在田头进行讨论总结，回去后再在生产队或生产小组中进行传达讨论，带动社员总结自己的经验教训，制订晚稻增产措施。
    代表们在认真检查评比了全大队各种代表田以后，一致认为，只要加强领导，因地制宜地认真贯彻农业增产“八字宪法”，一般都可获得秋季更大丰收。例如第八生产队有片三等田，自然条件不好、土瘦易涝，去年亩产二百五十斤。今年由于这个队领导很深入，项项增产措施都和群众商量，发动大家开好排水沟、改串灌为轮灌，增积和增施基肥、追肥，实行合理密植，结果产量可比去年增产一倍以上。
    至于生长一般的田地，大都是贯彻“八字宪法”不够造成的。如有的虽然实行了合理密植，但由于追肥不及时或后期田间管理不善，因此仅能获得平产或略有增产。
    代表们评比鉴定了各落后田以后指出，这些落后田的共同特点是插得稀，穗短粒少，大部分要比去年减产。主要原因是主观努力不够，领导不深入，耕作差，贯彻“八字宪法”差等造成的。如第二生产队一片七亩二等田，由于没有认真贯彻“八字宪法”，田地耙得不平，基肥下得少，追肥迟，插得宽，结果每亩比相邻的一片三等田少收一百多斤。
    通过上述群众性的认真评比鉴定，总结出了经验教训以后，大大教育和鼓舞了干部和社员，并以贯彻“八字宪法”为中心订出了晚季增产措施。他们除了根据山田、洋田和个别烂泥田、深水田等不同情况订出晚稻合理密植规格外，同时还大抓积肥和秧苗管理工作，并决定在夏收夏种结束后，即抽出40％的劳力上山安营扎寨，就地积肥施肥，加强边远田管理，争取晚季更大丰收。
