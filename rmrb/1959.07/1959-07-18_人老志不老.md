    Old in Years, Young in Spirit
    At four o'clock, just as the sky was beginning to lighten, Teacher Zhai Yuzhi of the Yangquan City No. 2 Mine Transportation and Sales Workshop in Shanxi Province got up. He took his textbook, paper, and pen, and by five o'clock, he was in the factory's spare-time school classroom, concentrating on reviewing new characters. Teacher Zhai has really put a lot of hard work into his cultural studies. During the noon break, his apprentice is his cultural tutor; in the evening, he pulls his youngest daughter to be his home tutor. On his way to and from work, if he remembers forgetting a character, he will grab someone and ask.
    Master Zhai often says: "I still want to live for several more decades to live in a communist society, and do more good for future generations." In the past, he didn't go home after work and didn't rest on Sundays. When he figured out something, he would go to the electromechanical section to find someone to draw a diagram, but the draftsman always couldn't understand what he meant, and what was drawn was never what he imagined, which was really frustrating. Now it's great, with an education, when he figures out something new, he can draw a rough sketch himself, indicating the modified parts, and directly hand the sketch to the electromechanical section.
    Don't think he's over fifty years old, no one can shake his enthusiasm for learning, he will tell you: "I want to be a college graduate in this life!" (Gong Yuan)

    人老志不老
    四点钟，天刚蒙蒙亮，山西阳泉市二矿运销车间的翟玉志老师傅就起床了。他拿上课本、纸、笔，五点钟就来到厂里业余学校教室，一个人聚精会神地复习着生字。翟老师傅在文化学习上可真下了不少苦功夫。中午休息的时候，徒弟是他的文化教员；晚上，又拉着小女儿给他作家庭教师。在上下班的路上，想起一个什么字忘了，也拉着人问一问。
    翟师傅常说：“我还想活它几十年，过过共产主义社会的生活，还要为子孙后代多造一点福呢。”以前他下班后不回家，星期不休息，琢磨出点东西就去机电科找人绘图，但绘图员总是听不懂他说的是什么意思，画出来老不像他所想的，真是急死人。现在好了，有了文化，琢磨出来什么新鲜东西，自己就画个草图，注明改装的部件，直接将草图交给机电科。
    你不要看他五十多岁了，谁要想动摇他的学习情绪可办不到，他会对你说：“我这辈子还要作一个大学毕业生呢！”（工员）
