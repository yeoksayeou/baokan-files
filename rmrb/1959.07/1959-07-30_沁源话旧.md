I decided to go to Qin Yuan to personally admire this heroic city.

The bus stopped on a street in Qin Yuan. On both sides were newly built houses, and the street trees had not yet had time to grow. This straight and narrow street was clean and very quiet.

On its right side leaned the West Mountain. The West Mountain was covered with a faint shadow. It uses its loving arms, as it did in the past, and as it does now, to caress this town. On the left, the famous Qin River flows downward. That low-lying, open field is like a piece of white cloth on an embroidery frame, with plows and carefully selected seeds like needles and threads, eventually creating a beautiful pattern of harvest.

There were not many pedestrians on the street. After the communization, women's stores appeared, and community-run industries brought their own workers. It was an afternoon with only a warm sun and no dust. After their midday nap, the farmers were completing the last third of their workday, so the doors were ajar, and even the children had gone to the nursery.

The residential houses sandwiched between the shops were all two-story buildings. The lower floor was for living, and the upper floor was their warehouse. The ventilation was excellent, melon vines hung from the beams, and yellow corn cobs were wrapped around the pillars. The sun poured its entire light onto the fields, illuminating them with a bright glow. The plowed land was like bolts of shining yellow satin. The shimmering reflections of the Qin River mixed with the heavy vapor of the earth.

In the previous two and a half years of fighting against the enemy, they learned mutual assistance and self-salvation, and now they are advancing along the path of the commune. They have never feared difficulties, and they have never thought of fearing any difficulties again.

In the narrations of those militiamen (now they are all cadres on the production front), they praised this land like praising their own mother. They said: "We are fighting, and this land is also fighting; its victory is our victory."

This land, under the iron hooves of the enemy, was once like a resounding war drum, calling on its children to carry out a victorious battle. The enemy could destroy all the houses, but they could not destroy all the ditches and streets. Familiar terrain protected each of them. The same place was a deadly trap for the enemy.

They sing "In the dense woods"... Although the trees were cut down by the enemy, patches of yellow artemisia grew out. They believed that they would never see these bowl-thick, densely lined yellow artemisia, which grew because the land was barren; but at that time, a life-and-death battle was taking place in this yellow artemisia forest.

From the beginning, they used a scorched-earth policy to treat the enemy. The earth grew everything, and the earth helped them hide everything. Every family had one or several cellars. They did not leave a single grain for the enemy on the ground, and they could not allow these grains to rot underground. Thus, the struggle to unearth grain began.

The cellar-constituted battle line, from far to near, directly stirred into the heart of the enemy. Those with cellars in the enemy's courtyard had to retreat. Those nights, the militiamen lit torches with hemp stalks, and the fighting ranks were like a torchlight parade.

At that time, the evacuated people lived in the areas of Wumu Gully and Caojia Gully in the West Mountain. Each gully was a street. They elected street chiefs, arranged housing, and the grain was supported by the Eighth Route Army saving two liang per person per day, sharing life and death. However, they also had their own harvest year. The wheat seeds that fell into the ground in 1943 grew again the following year. When the wheat was ripe, the enemy did not go to harvest it, but waited for the militiamen to harvest it, and then robbed it at the threshing ground. If they couldn't get it, they would set it on fire. But the militiamen were wise and brave, and the enemy could not say they could not get it, but even the opportunity to burn it was not available.

Finally, every street was blocked. The mine encirclement attacked the enemy's barbed wire. This barbed wire kept shrinking backward, shrinking only slightly larger than the enemy's bunkers. Glorious Ge Zhen, the temple of landmines built by you, the enemy will die if they touch you. "Scattering Ge Zhen on the banks of the Qin River - there is no way for the devils (ghosts) to crawl." This saying is still circulating to commemorate you.

Every well also has its own history of struggle. Today, the militiamen unload the well rope, and tomorrow the enemy covers it with barbed wire. The enemy built cement pools on the mountain and captured civilians to carry water from the Qin River to the mountain. However, the water transportation line was long, and the militiamen could ambush the water carriers at any time.

Countless ambushes, countless bombings of bunkers, countless handy landmine warfare, countless cheers and victories... but the price paid was also heavy. Every battle left a footprint in the heart, and every day left unforgettable tragic memories.

"Qin Yuan people" not only gained the resounding and proud title in the past struggle against the enemy; but also are a commune with brilliant achievements in today's Great Leap Forward.

The next day, I followed a militia hero and walked through all the streets. New houses were built on the original foundations; but there was no time to demolish some other broken walls. There is no need to be too busy, since it can be used as fertilizer, it will eventually be dug out one day. Only the three stone-built cave dwellings at the foot of the mountain are still old objects from more than ten years ago. The militia hero pointed to it and said: "In those years, the enemy's sheepfold was in front of this cave dwelling. They robbed the sheep during the day, and we came to pull the sheep at night. Three hundred were pulled in one night." Further up, there is a row of air-raid shelters on the leveled mountain wall, which later became the residence of captured civilians. Standing on the top of the mountain, you can see the high mountain behind you, which is the famous "Shenren Gutui". At the beginning, a fake tree was erected on this "Shenren Gutui", just like putting a pot of flowers on the windowsill during the underground work era, and all the people who rushed to plant and harvest used it as a signal to advance and retreat. The militia hero said to me: "At that time, landmines were buried on all roads leading to the city gate." I estimated it and said: "That would tightly suppress the enemy in this city gate!" The militia hero said: "No, it's even smaller than this. Only this mountain top under your feet is where it is active. The road we just came up is the enemy's only transportation trench. In front, you see, the ditch close to the foot of the mountain is where the enemy used to erect barbed wire. A trench is dug behind, we can't climb up, and the enemy naturally can't go down..." In this palm-sized place, I saw a destroyed bunker, a water pool made of cement, an elm tree... If measured by steps, it is at most no more than two volleyball courts in size. I asked: "So small, the enemy has to sleep row by row, which is worse than a pigsty!" The militia hero smiled and said: "Do you think they dare to live on the ground? No, there is a row of earth kilns there, but unfortunately the enemy burned them themselves when they retreated."

At this time, on the fields at the foot of the mountain, the reflection on the glass in front of the tractor shot towards the sky like a searchlight...

The militia hero was staring at that side, forgetting to answer my question. He took my hand and said: "Don't you want to see it? Come on, let's go down and see the tractor!"

    沁源话旧
    雷加
    我决定到沁源去，是要亲自瞻仰这座英雄的城。
    公共汽车在沁源街头停住。两旁是新建的房屋，街树还没来得及成长起来。这条直直的，又是窄窄的街道，干干净净，十分幽静。
    它的右面靠着西山。西山上蒙着一层淡淡的阴影。它用它那慈爱的手臂，过去如此，现在也是如此，爱抚着这个城镇。左面，有名的沁河向下流去。那一片低下去的开阔的田野，正像绣花架上的一面白布，耕犁和精选的种子有如针和丝线，最后会是一副美丽的丰收图案。
    街上没有多少行人。公社化以后，出现了女子商店，社办工业又带来了自己的工人。这是一个只有和煦的太阳，没有风尘的下午。农民午睡之后，正在完成这一天最后三分之一的劳动日，所以，门户虚掩着，连小孩也到幼儿院去了。
    夹在商店之间的民户，全是二层楼房。下面住人，上面是他们的仓房。通风极好，瓜条挂在梁上，黄艳艳的玉米穗子又缠在柱子上。太阳把整个光线倾注在田野上，照得那片田野浑身透亮发光。耙过的土地，像一匹匹闪光的黄缎。沁河的水光浮影，又和大地沉郁的蒸气搅混在一起。
    从前那两年半的对敌斗争中，他们就懂得互助自救了，现在又沿着公社的大道前进。他们没有惧怕过困难，他们也从来没有想到再惧怕什么困难。
    在那些民兵（现在他们都是生产战线上的干部了）的叙述中，他们称赞这块土地像称赞自己的母亲一样。他们说：“我们战斗着，这块土地也在战斗着；它的胜利就是我们的胜利。”
    这块土地，在敌人铁蹄之下，曾经像一面铮铮响的战鼓，号召它的儿女们进行了胜利的战斗。敌人可以摧毁所有的房屋，却不能破坏一切沟渠和街道。熟习的地形，掩护着他们每一个人。同是这块地方，对敌人来说，就是致命的陷井。
    他们歌唱着“在密密的树林里”……树木虽然被敌人砍光了，成片的黄蒿随着生出来了。他们相信一生中再也不会看见因为荒芜了土地而生出来的这些碗粗的、密密行行的黄蒿了；可是当时，就是在这片黄蒿林子里进行着你死我活的战斗。
    他们一开始就用坚壁清野来款待敌人。大地生长了一切，大地又帮助他们隐藏了一切。每一家都有一个或几个地窖。他们在地面上不给敌人留下一颗粮食，同时也不能让这些粮食在地下有一颗烂掉。于是刨粮斗争就开始了。
    地窖构成的战线，由远而近，一直捣进敌人的心脏。在敌人院子里有地窖的，敌人只有退避。那些夜晚，民兵用麻秆燃着火把，战斗的行列有如火炬游行一般。
    那时，退出去的老百姓，住在西山乌木沟、曹家沟一带。一条沟就是一条街。他们选举了街闾长，安排了住房，粮食是由八路军每日每人节约二两，生死相共支援来的。不过，他们也有自己的丰收年。1943年落在地里的麦种，第二年又长出来了。麦熟的时候，敌人不去收割，只等民兵收割下来，他到麦场上抢劫，抢不到手，就纵火烧掉它。可是民兵是智勇双全的，敌人不要说抢不到手，连烧掉它的机会也得不到。
    最后，每条街道都封锁了。地雷的包围线，向敌人的铁丝网进攻。这道铁丝网，一直向后收缩，收缩得只比敌人的碉堡略大一些。光荣的葛榛，由你搭成的地雷的圣殿，敌人触到你，就得死亡。“沁河岸上撒葛榛——没有龟（鬼）爬的路。”至今还流传着这句歇后语，来纪念你。
    每口井，也都有自己斗争的历史。今天民兵卸去井绳，明天敌人罩上铁丝网。敌人在山上打了洋灰池子，抓民伕由沁河往山上驮水。可是，运水线长，民兵随时可以伏击水驮子。
    无数次摸哨，无数次炸碉堡，无数次得心应手的地雷战，无数次的欢呼和胜利……但是付出的代价也是沉重的。每一个战斗都在心窝上留下了脚印，每一天都留下了难忘的悲壮回忆。
    “沁源人”，不但在过去的对敌斗争中，得到了铮铮响的骄傲的称呼；在今天大跃进中，也是有着光辉成绩的公社。
    第二天，我跟着一个民兵英雄，走遍了所有的街道。新的房屋在原有的基础上建起来了；可是没有时间去拆除另外一些断墙残壁。这也不必太忙，既然它可以当做肥料，终有一天会把它刨光的。只有山下那三眼石砌窑洞，还是十几年前的旧物。民兵英雄指着它说：“当年敌人的羊圈就在这座窑洞前面。他们白天抢回羊群，我们晚上就来拉羊。一天晚上一口气拉了它三百只。”再往上走，削平的山壁上有一排防空窑，后来成了被俘的民伕住处。站在山顶上，便望见了身后那座高山，这就是有名的“神人圪堆”。当初，一棵假树立在这“神人圪堆”上，就像地下工作时代窗台上放上一盆花似的，抢种抢收的人，全以它为进退的信号。民兵英雄对我说：“那时，凡是通到城关的道路，都埋着地雷。”我估量了一下，说道：“那就把敌人紧紧压在这个城关里啦！”民兵英雄说：“不，比这还小。只有脚下这个山头，才是它活动的地方。刚才我们上来的那条路，是敌人唯一的交通壕。前面，你看到啦，紧靠山脚的水渠，就是过去敌人架铁丝网的地方。后面挑开一道壕沟，我们爬不上来，敌人自然也下不去……”我在这块巴掌大的地方上，看见了一座摧毁了的碉堡，一个用水泥砌成的水池子，一棵榆树……如果用步子量量，至多不过有两个排球场那么大。我问：“这么小，敌人只好排挨排睡下，比猪圈还不如呢！”民兵英雄笑了笑：“你以为他们敢住在地面上吗？不，那里有一排地窑子，可惜敌人撤退时自己烧了。”
    这时，山下的田野上，拖拉机前面玻璃上的反光，像探照灯一般，向天空射去……
    民兵英雄正注视着那边，忘记了回答我的问话。他拉起我的手，说道：“你不去看吗？走，下去看看拖拉机吧！”
