    Raising Hell on "The Father of Ice Mountains"

    June 20th. This morning, the weather is very good. After breakfast, all team members put on their climbing boots with "crampons" (anti-slip metal claws with spikes), fastened their chest straps, and put on sunglasses to prevent snow glare, preparing for high-altitude ice and snow operations practice. At this time, the team headquarters sent athletic champions Shi Zhanchun, Xu Jing, Liu Dayi, Chen Rongchang, and first-class athletes Wang Zhenhua and Zhang Xiang to form a reconnaissance team to scout the route from the first high-altitude camp to the 6,200-meter altitude to be reached during the second march.

    For a mountaineer, excellent equipment, a strong physique, and high-altitude adaptability are not enough. They must also have safe and agile movement techniques on complex ice and snow terrain. The road ahead to the 6,200-meter altitude is the "icefall" area, the most complex terrain on Mount Muztagata, with countless obvious and snow-covered, unfathomably deep ice and snow crevasses, as well as abrupt ice slopes and snow rocks. The slightest carelessness can lead to unimaginable dangers. In the climbing team, most of the female mountaineers and a small number of male team members are still novices. Therefore, on the snow slope of the first high-altitude camp, a new lesson began.

    Ice and snow operation practice was carried out in ten "rope teams," each with four people. Each group was connected by a main rope. The team members practiced snow slope movement methods and personal protection and collective protection in complex terrain. Climbing team instructor Wang Fengtong, deputy captain Shi Jing, and coach Peng Shuli patrolled and checked every basic movement.

    Dark clouds covered the sun, and snowflakes fluttered down, the severe cold pressing in. But the practice continued in an orderly manner. Some rope teams were ascending in a straight line, some were moving in a zigzag pattern, and some were descending snow slopes. Soon, the dark clouds dispersed, the sun shone on the snow-capped mountains, and the weather became extremely hot again. Team members practiced personal protection and collective protection, deliberately falling down and immediately protecting themselves, stabilizing their bodies. The whole group was also practicing. Here they shouted, "Beware of the crevasse!" There they shouted, "Protect!" Here they traversed the snow slope, there they descended rapidly. The first high-altitude camp became a noisy battlefield.

    At 3:30 PM, the reconnaissance team returned from the 6,200-meter high ground. The team members at the first high-altitude camp raised their ice axes and cheered for them: "We are raising hell on the Father of Ice Mountains!" Shi Zhanchun, director of the Mountaineering Department of the National Sports Commission and athletic champion, waved to everyone and replied with a smile:
  "Raise hell! You are true heavenly soldiers and generals!"

      Second Altitude

    June 26th.

    Yesterday, the second march and exercise began, and we camped at the first high-altitude camp that night.

    There were five days between the first and second marches. During this period, the team members rested at the base camp, and their physical strength had recovered. Life at the base camp was very interesting: Tibetan male team member Sonam Dorje made a small water mill model out of empty cans and wood chips, and the stream from the Yangbulake Glacier kept the mill turning. Han Chinese female team members and Tibetan female team members captured two marmots living on the mountains above 4,000 meters near the camp. Some volleyball enthusiasts couldn't forget to play volleyball even at such a high altitude. However, we couldn't stay here for long. The team members had to actively carry out the second march and exercise, which was a crucial march to determine whether they could climb the main peak. This march would encounter the most complex terrain on Mount Muztagata.

    We set off at 8:00 AM, each person carrying an average of 15 kilograms. The footprints left by the reconnaissance team last time had been covered by the wind and snow on the mountain. The experienced athletes of the reconnaissance team had to reopen the route in front.

    The first difficulty encountered was a steep ice slope of 40 degrees. It was more than 50 meters long, like a mirror extending to the Yangbulake Glacier on the left. The team members wore climbing boots with "crampons," and ice flowers flew everywhere under their feet. Just as everyone in the rope team was about to pass safely, a shout of "Protect!" came from behind. It turned out that a new team member had slipped down the ice slope. Almost in the same instant, the other three mountaineers in the rope team immediately lay down, violently inserting their ice axes into the thick ice layer on the ice slope. The slipped team member was immediately rescued because he was connected to the other three by the main rope.

    After passing the ice slope, the team members sat on the snow slope to rest. One team member sighed and said: If we hadn't taken the lesson of raising hell on "The Father of Ice Mountains," who knows how many people would have rolled down into the Yangbulake Glacier this time.

    The team members continued to move forward. The next difficulty was the "icefall" area. From a distance, the "icefall" area looked as if it had undergone a major earthquake, with snow accumulated unevenly, ice and snow crevasses everywhere, and ice blocks cascading down. The experienced pathfinding athletes had to bypass one obvious crevasse after another, and tap the snow ahead with their ice axes to test it, guarding against snow covering hidden crevasses. Everyone advanced by stepping on every footprint that had been explored. The main rope connecting the team members was lengthened to 40 meters, so that if one person fell into an unfathomable crevasse, it would be easier for the other three to rescue him.

    Thanks to the extreme care of the pathfinding team members, the "icefall" area was safely passed. Ahead was the third difficulty—a 60-degree snow slope. The snow here was knee-deep, so that the captain of the pathfinding team, athletic champion Xu Jing, had to use his arms and ice axe to support himself every time he took a step forward in order to pull his legs out of the snow. Breathing became rapid, and they had to rest every half hour. Fatigue attacked every team member, and some people even fell asleep on their backpacks during the ten-minute rest.

    Just as they were about to reach the second high-altitude camp at 6,200 meters above sea level, an unfathomable crevasse suddenly blocked the way. Everyone was anxious when suddenly they discovered a snow bridge spanning the crevasse more than 100 meters ahead. Crossing the snow bridge was frightening, but with the protection of experienced team members, people finally passed safely. Ahead, the second high-altitude camp was welcoming the mountaineering athletes.

    The team members who arrived first had already started setting up tents, and the later ones followed one after another. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, but unexpectedly, photographer Shen Jie (who was filming a color film) had just walked not far out of the tent, preparing to capture the scene of establishing the camp, when he suddenly fell into a crevasse with a thud. As soon as he realized he had lost his balance, he quickly stretched out his arms, just in time to support himself in the middle of the crevasse. Every time he struggled, he fell a little further down. Shi Zhanchun, director of the Mountaineering Department of the National Sports Commission, hurriedly shouted: Don't move! Shi Zhanchun crawled forward to rescue him, and quickly connected Shen Jie with the main rope and pulled him out. But when Shen Jie returned along the original route, the original snow bridge had become unstable because too many people had passed over it, and he fell into the crevasse again, bridge and all. Fortunately, he was connected to Shi Zhanchun by the main rope, which avoided the danger. In order to avoid further danger, the leaders of the mountaineering team drew a circle around the tents with ice axes, strictly prohibiting team members from stepping outside this area.

    At the second high-altitude camp, most team members still had mild altitude sickness, with only a few experiencing severe headaches and vomiting. Because of the lack of oxygen at night, breathing was very uneven, and most team members took sleeping pills to fall asleep, but all of these were normal reactions at such a high altitude.

    登山日记

    大闹“冰山之父”
    6月20日。今晨起床，天气很好。吃完早饭，所有队员都穿上了绑着“冰爪”（带有钉子的防滑金属爪）的登山靴，拴上了胸带，戴上了防止雪光反射的太阳镜，准备进行高山冰雪作业练习。这时候，队部派出了运动健将史占春、许竞、刘大义、陈荣昌和一级运动员王振华、张祥等六人，组成了侦察组，去侦察从第一号高山营地出发通往第二次行军所要达到的拔海六千二百米高度时，所要经过的道路。
    对于一个登山运动员来说，光有优良的装备、健壮的体格和高度的高山适应性还十分不够，他们还必须具有在复杂的冰雪地形上安全而又敏捷的行动技术。前面通往拔海六千二百米高度的道路，正是慕士塔格山地形最复杂的“冰瀑”地区，途中隐现着无数明显的和被雪覆盖的深不可测的冰雪裂隙，还有突兀的冰坡和雪岩。稍一不慎，便会发生难以设想的危险。而登山队伍中，大部分女子登山运动员和一少部分男队员都还是新手。因此，在第一号高山营地的雪坡上，新的一课开始了。
    冰雪作业练习是按照十个“结组”每组四个人进行的。每个小组都用主绳连系在一起。队员们便在复杂的地形上练习了雪坡上的行动方法和个人保护、集体保护三个内容。登山队指导员王凤桐、副队长石竞和教练员彭淑力，巡回检查他们每一个基本动作。
    一朵朵乌云遮住了太阳，雪花顿时飞舞起来，严寒逼人。但是练习仍有条不紊地进行着。有的结组在直线上升，有的在作“之”字形前进，有的在下雪坡。不久，乌云散了，太阳普照着雪山，天气又变得炎热非常。队员在练习个人保护和集体保护，他们故意摔倒，又立即自我保护住，稳定住身体。全组也在进行练习。这里在喊：“注意裂缝！”那里在喊：“保护！”这里横过雪坡，那里在快速下降。第一号高山营地变成了喧闹的战场。
    下午三时半，侦察组从拔海六千二百米的高地回来了。在第一号高山营地的队员们举起冰镐向他们欢呼：“我们在大闹冰山之父！”国家体委登山处处长、运动健将史占春向大家频频招手，笑着回答说：
  “闹吧！你们是真正的天兵天将！”
      第二高度
    6月26日。
    昨天开始第二次行军锻炼，当晚在第一号高山营地宿营。
    从第一次行军到第二次行军，中间相隔共五天。这期间，队员在大本营经过休息，体力已经恢复。大本营的生活是很有趣的：藏族男队员素南多吉用空罐头盒和木片做成了一个很小的水磨模型，洋布拉克冰川的溪流把这盘磨转动不停。汉族女队员和藏族女队员在营地附近活捉住了两只生活在四千多米高的山地上的旱獭。一些排球爱好者们在这样高的地方，也忘不了玩排球。但是，不能在这里久停，队员们必须积极进行第二次行军锻炼，这是能否攀登主峰的一次关键性的行军锻炼。这次行军，途中将碰到慕士塔格山地形最复杂的地区。
    早晨八时出发，每个人平均负重十五公斤。上次侦察组踏出的脚印，已经被山上的风雪所遮盖。侦察组有经验的运动员只好重新在前面开路。
    首先碰到的困难是四十度陡的冰坡。它有五十多米长，像一面反光镜一直伸延到左边的洋布拉克冰川上，队员穿着带有“冰爪”的登山靴，冰花在脚下纷纷四射，眼看大家结组就要安全地通过了。忽然后面传来一声“保护！”原来一个新队员从冰坡上滑下去了。几乎是在同一刹那，这个结组的其他三个登山运动员立即卧倒，他们猛地把冰镐插在冰坡上厚厚的冰层之中，滑下去的队员由于有主绳连结着其他三个人，所以立时就得了救。
    过了冰坡，队员坐在雪坡上休息。有一个队员感叹地说：如果不是上了一次大闹“冰山之父”的课，这回可不知有多少人要滚下洋布拉克冰川里去。
    队员继续前进，前面就是第二道难关——“冰瀑”地区。远远看去，“冰瀑”地区好像经过了一场很大的地震，积雪七陷八落，到处是冰雪裂缝，到处是倾泻下的冰块。富有经验的开路的运动员们，不得不绕过一个个明显的裂缝，并且用冰镐敲击着试探前面的积雪，提防积雪遮盖了隐藏的裂缝。所有的人都踏着探索出来的每一个脚印前进。连结组员的主绳放长到了四十米，这样一来，如果有一个人掉进了深不可测的裂缝，其他三个人就更便于营救。
    由于开路队员极其细心，“冰瀑”区安全通过了。前面又遇到了第三道难关——六十度的大雪坡。这里雪深及膝，以至于前面开路的队长、运动健将许竞每前进一步，都不得不用手臂和冰镐撑着身子，才能把腿从雪中拔出来。呼吸喘急起来了，每半个小时就要休息一次。疲倦袭击着每一个队员，有的人在十多分钟的休息过程中，坐在背包上甚至一下子就要睡着。
    眼看就要到达拔海六千二百米的第二号高山营地了，但一条深不可测的裂缝突然挡住了去路。大家正在焦急，忽然发现前面一百多米以外，一座雪桥横跨在裂缝之上。踏过雪桥令人提心吊胆，但在有经验的队员保护下，人们终于都安全地通过了。前面，第二号高山营地在迎接登山健儿。
    先到达的队员已经开始在搭帐篷，后来的也一个个跟了上来。大家正松了一口气，没想到摄影师沈杰（他在拍一部五彩影片）刚走出帐篷不远，准备把建立营地的情景摄入镜头时，扑通一声，一下子就掉进了一个裂缝中去。他一发觉自己失去平衡，急忙把两臂伸开，正好把自己撑在裂缝中间。他每挣扎一下，便要更向下降一点。国家体委登山处处长史占春急忙喊：不要动！史占春匍匐行进上前营救，只见他用主绳连结上了沈杰，很快就把他救了出来。但当沈杰顺原路回来时，原来的雪桥因为过人很多，已经不结实了，他连人带雪桥又掉进裂缝中去了。幸好他同史占春连结着主绳，才避免了危险。为了避免再发生危险，登山队的领导在帐篷周围用冰镐划了一个圈子，严禁队员越出这个范围。
    在第二号高山营地上，大多数队员的高山反应还是轻微的，只有少数人头痛厉害，有呕吐现象发生。晚上睡觉因为高度缺氧，呼吸很不均匀，多数队员吃了安眠药才能入睡，但所有这些，都是在这样高度时的正常反应。　（二续）
