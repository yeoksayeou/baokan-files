    Consolidating and Developing Socialist National Relations
    Kui Bi, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has undergone a new transformation in its national relations after achieving great victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The relations between the people of all nationalities in the region, built upon the foundation of equality, fraternity, unity, and mutual assistance established after liberation, have entered a new historical period of socialist national relations characterized by great unity, great collaboration, common labor, and common development. This socialist national relationship is being continuously consolidated and developed along with the development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland and the autonomous region.
    The people of Inner Mongolia once endured days of hardship and suffering. The oppression of imperialism, the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and the oppression of the feudal classes within the Mongolian nationality plunged the Mongolian people into a state of poverty, backwardness, disease, and decline, creating divisions, discrimination, and mutual distrust between nationalities. With the victory of the Chinese revolution, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Inner Mongolia, within the unified family of the motherland, achieved national regional autonomy. In the short span of over a dozen years, through the efforts of the Mongolian people and the people of all nationalities themselves, and with the assistance of the Han working people, the political, economic, cultural, and other construction undertakings have undergone a leap forward development, shaking off the historical state of poverty, backwardness, disease, and decline. The political outlook, mental outlook, and material and cultural life of the people have undergone profound and historically significant changes. From a political perspective, the relations between nationalities and within nationalities have been thoroughly transformed, and a new situation of equality, fraternity, great unity, great collaboration, common labor, and common development has emerged between the Mongolian and Han nationalities and among the various minority nationalities in the region. From the perspective of economic and cultural construction, from the establishment of the autonomous region in 1947 to the end of 1958, the total value of industrial and agricultural output in the region increased more than fourfold. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, more than 80,000 tons of iron and more than 10,000 tons of steel were produced, ending the history of being "without an inch of iron." The iron and steel industrial base centered on Baotou Steel is taking shape, which is playing an increasingly important role in fundamentally changing the economic landscape of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The Greater Khingan Range forest industrial base, which provides a large amount of timber for the country, has been initially established. Grain output has increased by 2.4 times; the number of livestock has increased by nearly two times. Cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also developed rapidly. On the basis of production development, the living standards of the people of all nationalities have been greatly improved. From 1947 to the end of 1958, the purchasing power of urban and rural people in the region increased by 4.5 times. The Mongolian population increased by 300,000, and the population of minority nationalities in the region has also greatly increased, presenting a prosperous scene everywhere with both people and wealth thriving.
    Why has the national relationship in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region been able to achieve such great development in such a short period of time? There are the following basic reasons.
    First, the Party's nationality policy is great and correct. The people of all nationalities in Inner Mongolia understand from their own experience that only under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, in the great family of the People's Republic of China, and by realizing national regional autonomy, can the people of all nationalities move towards prosperity and happiness. Because the realization of national regional autonomy has given the Mongolian people and the people of all nationalities the right to be masters of their own affairs, greatly promoted national self-esteem, a sense of responsibility, and initiative, and improved the enthusiasm of the people of all nationalities in political and economic construction, the production and construction of the autonomous region have been able to develop rapidly.
    Second, the implementation of democratic reform and socialist transformation, and the realization of the people's commune system. Due to the implementation of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, the people of all nationalities not only overthrew the rule of imperialism and feudalism and transformed the bourgeoisie, abolished the system of exploitation, but also eliminated the basis for the existence of capitalist exploitation. Marx and Engels said long ago: "In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end." (The Communist Manifesto) Precisely because of this, the relations between nationalities, within nationalities, and between people have been fundamentally changed.
    Third, the great development of economic and cultural construction, especially the Great Leap Forward of 1958, greatly improved the economic and cultural living standards of the people of all nationalities, enabling the Mongolian nationality and the various minority nationalities in the region to gradually move towards the ranks of the advanced nationalities of the motherland, the economic and cultural differences have been gradually narrowed, and the relationship between nationalities has been further strengthened. The development of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, commerce, culture, and education will inevitably promote mutual exchanges, mutual learning, and mutual assistance among the people of all nationalities. In particular, the development of modern industry has not only laid the foundation for the modernization of various construction projects in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, but also has far-reaching significance in politics. For example, due to the development of industry, the working class of the native nationality has grown up. Before liberation, there were very few Mongolian workers. Now it has developed to more than 43,000 employees. The number of employees of various minority nationalities in the region has now developed to more than 15,000. In the Baotou Steel enterprise alone, there are now hundreds of Mongolian and other minority nationalities enterprise management cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and 1,700 workers. The growth of the working class within a nationality marks the political, economic, and cultural improvement of this nationality.
    Fourth, in various practical struggles, education on the Marxist-Leninist view of nationality, patriotic education, and a series of class education such as socialism and communism have been carried out to improve the level of awareness of the people of all nationalities. As the practical struggle of the revolution moves forward step by step, as class education deepens step by step, the class consciousness of the people of all nationalities improves step by step, and the socialist national relationship is consolidated and developed step by step on the basis of the improvement of the people's class consciousness.
    Fifth, in various practical struggles, and in the continuous improvement of political and ideological levels, cadres with communist ideas from the Mongolian nationality and the various nationalities in the region have been cultivated. Among the 130,000 cadres in the Inner Mongolia region, there are already 21,000 Mongolian cadres and more than 5,700 cadres of Daur, Ewenki, Hui, Manchu, and other minority nationalities. With this group of cadres who have grown up in struggle and have a certain level of communist awareness as the core, the consolidation and development of socialist national relations has a reliable guarantee.
    The socialist national relationship in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been established. At present, our task is to better consolidate and develop this relationship, and to educate and organize the people of all nationalities to build a great motherland, build the autonomous region, and build a future of unlimited beauty, freedom, and brightness for the people of all nationalities.
    When the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established in 1947, in a telegram to the People's Congress of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhu De instructed us: "The Inner Mongolia compatriots who have suffered greatly are beginning to create a new history of freedom and brightness," and instructed us to strive for: "Building a new Inner Mongolia and a new China." We have faithfully implemented the instructions of Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhu De in the past. In the future, we must make greater efforts to implement this instruction, consolidate and develop socialist national relations, and strive to create a free and bright history for Inner Mongolia, the great motherland – to build socialism and communism.

    巩固发展社会主义的民族关系
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记　奎璧
    内蒙古自治区，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，在取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大胜利以后，民族关系发生了一个新变化。区内各民族人民之间的关系，已经在解放以后建立起来的平等友爱、团结互助的基础上，进入了大团结、大协作、共同劳动、共同发展的社会主义民族关系的新的历史时期。这种社会主义民族关系，正在随着祖国和自治区社会主义革命和社会主义建设的发展而日益巩固和发展。
    内蒙古人民曾经有过艰难困苦的日子。帝国主义的压迫，国民党反动统治的压迫，蒙古民族内部封建阶级的压迫，使蒙古民族人民处于贫穷落后、疾病、衰亡的境地，曾经造成民族之间的隔阂、歧视和互不信任。随着中国革命的胜利，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，内蒙古在统一的祖国大家庭中，实现了民族区域自治，经过了短短的十几年的时间，在蒙古民族和各民族人民自己的努力下，在汉族劳动人民的帮助下，政治、经济、文化等建设事业有了一个飞跃的发展，摆脱了贫穷、落后、疾病、衰亡的历史状况，人们的政治面貌、精神面貌、物质文化生活面貌，都起了深刻而有重大历史意义的变化。从政治方面看，民族之间的关系和民族内部的关系彻底改变了，蒙汉民族之间和区内各少数民族之间出现了平等友爱、大团结、大协作、共同劳动、共同发展的新局面。从经济文化建设方面看，从自治区成立的1947年起到1958年底，全区工农业总产值增加了四倍以上，在大跃进的1958年，生产了八万多吨铁，一万多吨钢，结束了“手无寸铁”的历史；以包钢为中心的钢铁工业基地正在形成，这对内蒙古自治区经济面貌的根本改变，正在起着越来越大的影响。为国家提供大量木材的大兴安岭森林工业基地已经初步建成。粮食产量增加了二点四倍；牲畜头数增加了将近两倍。文化教育卫生事业，也得到了迅速的发展。在生产发展的基础上，各族人民的生活水平得到了很大改善，从1947年到1958年底，全区城乡人民的购买力提高了四倍半，蒙古族人口增加了三十万，区内少数民族人口也有很大的增长，到处呈现着人财两旺的繁荣景象。
    内蒙古自治区的民族关系为什么能够在很短时间取得这样巨大的发展呢？有以下几个基本原因。
    第一，是党的民族政策的伟大正确。内蒙古各族人民从自己亲身的体验中理解到，只有在党中央的统一领导下，在中华人民共和国大家庭中，实现民族区域自治，才是各族人民走向繁荣幸福的道路。因为实现了民族区域自治，蒙古族和各族人民得到了当家作主的权利，大大发扬了民族自尊心、责任心和主动精神，提高了各族人民在政治上、经济建设上的积极性，因而自治区的生产建设就得以飞跃地向前发展。
    第二，是实行了民主改革和社会主义改造，实现了人民公社化。由于实行了民主革命和社会主义革命，各族人民不但推翻了帝国主义和封建主义的统治，改造了资产阶级，废除了剥削制度，同时也消灭了资本主义剥削存在的基础。马克思和恩格斯早就说过：“人对人的剥削一消灭，民族对民族的剥削，也就会随之消灭。民族内部的阶级对抗一消失，民族之间的敌对关系，也就会随之消失。”（共产党宣言）正因为如此，就从根本上改变了民族间的关系、民族内部的关系和人与人之间的关系。
    第三，是经济文化建设的大发展，特别是1958年的大跃进，大大提高了各族人民的经济、文化生活水平，使蒙古族和区内各少数民族逐步走向祖国先进民族的行列，经济文化差别逐步缩小，民族之间的关系就进一步密切。工业、农业、牧业、林业、商业、文化教育的发展，必然要促进各族人民之间的互相交往、互相学习和互相帮助，特别是现代工业的发展，不但为内蒙古自治区各项现代化建设打下了基础，而且在政治上还有更深远的意义。例如，因为工业的发展，本民族的工人阶级生长起来了，解放以前蒙古族的工人寥寥可数，现在已经发展到四万三千多职工，区内各少数民族职工，现在已发展到一万五千多人。仅包钢一个企业内，现在就已经有了成百的蒙古族和各少数民族的企业管理干部、工程技术人员，和一千七百个工人。一个民族内部工人阶级的成长，标志着这个民族在政治上、经济上、文化上的提高。
    第四，是在各种实际斗争中，进行了马克思列宁主义民族观的教育、爱国主义教育和社会主义、共产主义等一系列阶级教育，提高了各民族人民的觉悟水平。革命的实际斗争一步一步的前进，阶级教育一步一步的深入，各民族人民的阶级觉悟就一步一步的提高，社会主义的民族关系就在人民的阶级觉悟提高的基础上一步一步的巩固和发展起来。
    第五，是在各种实际斗争中，在政治思想水平不断提高中，培养了蒙古族和区内各民族的具有共产主义思想的干部。现在内蒙古全区十三万干部中，已经有两万一千名蒙古族干部和五千七百多名达斡尔、鄂温克、回、满等族和其他少数民族干部，以这批在斗争中成长起来的有一定共产主义觉悟水平的干部为核心，社会主义民族关系的巩固和发展，就有了可靠的保证。
    内蒙古自治区社会主义的民族关系已经建立起来了。目前，我们的任务就是要更好的巩固和发展这种关系，教育和组织各族人民群众建设伟大的祖国，建设自治区，建设各民族人民无限美好的光明自由的将来。
    在1947年内蒙古自治区成立的时候，毛泽东同志和朱德同志给内蒙古自治区人民代表大会的电报中指示我们说：“曾经饱受困难的内蒙古同胞，正在开始创造自由光明的新历史”，指示我们要为：“建设新的内蒙古与新中国而奋斗。”我们过去忠实地执行了毛泽东同志和朱德同志的指示，今后我们一定要用更大的努力，为执行这个指示，巩固和发展社会主义的民族关系，为创造我们伟大祖国的内蒙古的自由光明的历史——建成社会主义和共产主义而奋斗。
