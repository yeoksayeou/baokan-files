Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 14th: The city of Baghdad today warmly celebrated the first anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Iraq. At exactly 6:00 AM, factory sirens, car horns, and church bells rang out together. Vehicles and pedestrians on the road stopped for three minutes, and people shouted, "Long live the revolution!"

Five minutes later, a military parade was held. The participating troops marched past the reviewing stand specially erected on Liberation Square on the east bank of the Tigris River. Reviewing the parade on the stand were the Chairman of the Iraqi Supreme Power Committee, Rubai, and members Nakshabandi, Prime Minister Qasim, and military commander Abdi. Seated on both sides of the reviewing stand were 350 representatives from 47 countries, foreign women representatives invited by the Iraqi Women's Rights Protection League, trade union representatives attending the Iraqi General Federation of Trade Unions Congress, foreign envoys, and government ministers.

Infantry, naval, and air force units participated in the two-hour parade. Jet fighters flew low over the square. Approximately 400 volunteers from the People's Resistance Forces participated in the parade, and they were warmly welcomed by the masses lining the streets leading to the square. Armored vehicles, tanks, heavy artillery, and anti-aircraft guns also participated in the parade. The new Iraqi flag flew in the air for the first time today. The new flag consists of black, white, and green horizontal stripes, with an eight-pointed red star surrounded by a yellow circle in the center.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 14th: Today, all newspapers here published editorials celebrating the first anniversary of the revolution, and called on the Iraqi people and various national forces to strengthen unity to defeat the common enemy.

The "People's Unity" newspaper appealed to people of all strata, saying, "The cause of protecting and developing the national republic and strengthening its democratic practices is not only the cause of our people. The people of all Arab countries and the people of all freedom-loving and democratic countries in the world place their hopes on the Iraqi people. Let us unite around the banner of July 14th and eliminate all differences to confront the enemies of the republic, thereby conforming to the hopes of Arabism and the trust of the noble people of the world."

The newspaper reminded that imperialism remains the most dangerous and vicious enemy, and therefore vigilance must be heightened and minor differences must be abandoned.

The newspaper called on workers to firmly unite around the trade unions, thwart imperialist conspiracies, and increase production. It called on farmers to strengthen farmers' associations, oppose division, and cooperate with the authorities to implement land reform. The newspaper also called on youth, women, students, and others to strengthen their democratic organizations and contribute greater efforts to defend the republic and promote its interests. Finally, the newspaper urged loyal government officials to strengthen cooperation and contact with the people and to comply with their demands for democracy and prosperity.

The "National News" newspaper, in its editorial, reviewed the victories achieved in various aspects during the year of the revolution. The newspaper pointed out that the unity of the internal ranks and the consolidated unity of people of all strata and sectors are the main reasons for the republic's various victories, especially in defeating the enemies' conspiracies.

Referring to the recent intensified provocations by the reactionaries, the newspaper said that these actions are "new means of dividing the national ranks, suppressing democratic life, and ultimately subverting the republic. We declare again that the people will avenge the martyrs who sacrificed in the past and recently."

The newspaper warned imperialism and their servants that the Iraqi people, united with the army, will crush any attempt to undermine the people's achievements and the victories of the revolution.

The "Voice of the Free" and "Era News" newspapers, in congratulating this festival, also called for strengthening national unity to defeat the common enemy.

The "Nationalist News" published a congratulatory letter from its editorial department to Qasim on the 13th.
