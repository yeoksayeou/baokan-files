    Silk

    There are many types of silk, generally divided into four categories: pure mulberry silk fabrics (bombyx silk), pure tussah silk fabrics, pure rayon fabrics, and fabrics blended with mulberry silk, tussah silk, rayon, and other fibers.

    The characteristics of silk are its soft luster and bright colors. It feels soft, smooth, cool, and comfortable when worn. Tussah silk has a firm texture and is durable. Silk is suitable for making summer clothes, ties, scarves, stockings, undershirts, curtains, tablecloths, bedspreads, chair cushions, and other daily decorative items.

    Silk fabrics also have heat resistance and insulation properties. Tussah silk is also resistant to acid and alkali and is durable. Therefore, it has a wide range of uses in light and heavy industry, the chemical industry, and the defense industry. For example, insulating silk is used to wrap electrical appliances and wires, silk is used to filter and sift powders, and silk is used to make fishing nets, parachutes for aviation, and acid- and alkali-resistant materials and work clothes. China's silk industry has a very bright and promising future. (Attached picture)

    丝绸
    丝绸的种类很多，一般可分为纯家蚕丝（桑蚕丝）织品、纯柞蚕丝织品、纯人造丝织品和桑、柞蚕丝、人造丝等纤维混织品等四大类。
    丝绸的特点是光泽柔和、色彩鲜艳，穿在身上柔软光滑，凉爽舒适；柞蚕绸质地坚牢，经久耐穿。丝绸适合做夏季的衣服、领带、围巾、丝袜、汗衫、窗帘、台毯、被面、椅垫和其他日用装饰品。
    丝织品还具有耐热、绝缘性能，柞蚕丝还能耐酸、耐碱而又耐用。因此，它在轻、重工业、化学工业和国防工业上的用途也很广，如用绝缘绸包扎电器、电线，用绸子过滤和筛粉，用丝做渔网、织航空用的降落伞和耐酸耐碱材料和工作服等等。丝绸事业在我国有十分光辉远大的发展前途。（附图片）
