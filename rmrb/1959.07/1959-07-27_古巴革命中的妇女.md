Women in the Cuban Revolution
By Violeta Casals, Head of the Cuban Women's Delegation

Cuba is a beautiful emerald, a land of abundance and fertility, coveted by pirates of yesterday and pirates of the twentieth century. The Cuban people are generous and magnanimous, and have never tolerated power without resistance. The men and women of Cuba have written a glorious chapter of heroism, fortitude, self-sacrifice, and selflessness in history. A simple review reveals that a spark of longing for freedom existed long ago on our beautiful land, sprouting and growing in the pure hearts of her first inhabitants, the Siboney, who preferred death to being slaves of the conquerors. Although their cotton breastplates were no match for the colonists' iron armor, guns, and hounds, they still fought the greedy adventurers with their bare hands. Four hundred and sixty-seven years after being conquered, we remember the names of the men and women who sacrificed themselves for the rights, justice, and freedom of our homeland. Our people yearn for and are determined to unflinchingly dedicate their lives to fighting for the right to control their own destiny.

Because our land is rich and fertile, beautiful and full of natural resources, the insatiable eyes of pirates are fixed on this place, and their claws are firmly grasping it for plunder and exploitation. The most intense and bloody struggle of the Cuban people is precisely against those who attempt to enslave and plunder them.

We find the root of our great disaster in imperialism: the result of past governments succumbing to and serving imperialism has made our independence nominal. The various bloody dictators fostered and protected by U.S. imperialism have also given us endless suffering. Our economy fluctuates with the ups and downs of the American market. Our land has been seized by American robbers, and our peasants are homeless, destitute, and without clothing or food. These are the true conditions in this rich, productive land that nature has favored. However, the outstanding sons and daughters of Cuba have generously shed blood to fight for freedom, social justice, and the recovery of national dignity. They are determined to overcome difficulties without compromising honor in any way. The future of Cuba and the solution to Cuban problems do not depend on selfish interests and the cold calculations of domestic and foreign merchants. Finally, a glorious dawn has arrived for the men and women of our country.

On March 10, 1952, the dictator Batista launched a criminal coup in an attempt to seize power, sparking angry struggles throughout the country. On this day, the Cuban people fought against those who trampled on our freedoms and democratic principles. On this day, our people understood that the military advisors of the American embassy carried out ugly activities together with Batista. This marked the beginning of a painful and bloody struggle, and the people began to find strength in themselves and unite closely, with only one desire and one will: give me liberty or give me death.

From the first arduous test, the attack on the Moncada Barracks on July 26, 1953, women bravely and resolutely dedicated their strength and enthusiasm to the revolution. In education and propaganda work, Cuban women effectively completed their tasks. As the struggle intensified, the ranks of women grew, and they risked danger to carry out propaganda, raise funds, transport and store weapons, and engage in the labor movement. They faced common dangers shoulder to shoulder with their fighting brothers: a police force equipped with pistols and machine guns, cruel instruments of torture, and skilled in the malicious use of these tools. This police force had basements in various police stations, and these dark places were equipped with the most brutal torture instruments; there were large carts for transporting the bodies of victims, throwing the bodies on the highway, throwing them into the sea, or secretly burying them, if they had not been dissolved in acid beforehand. In addition, women were often subjected to rape and humiliation. But the women's response to torture, torment, and despicable slaughter was to strengthen unity and become more determined and courageous. They admired the fearlessness of a noble Cuban woman, Mariana Grajales, the mother of the Maceo brothers, who sent her children to the battlefield in our war for independence. Mariana Grajales, a poor peasant woman, was the mother of heroes. This is how our rural women are. Our wars of liberation always have women participating. They personally experienced the various dangers threatening the motherland, participated in the struggle against the Machado dictatorship, and bravely fought the Batista dictatorship. Batista trampled on the motherland and obsequiously handed over our resources and property to foreign interest groups that protected him, bringing new pain to the motherland, and Cuban women naturally could not remain indifferent. The women of rural Cuba, cities, and the mountains of the Sierra Maestra all responded. They participated in work in the mountains, such as nurses, doctors, communicators, broadcasters, teachers, assistants to the rebel army and civil administration, as well as social workers and combatants. The women in the rebel army never forgot their fundamental mission: to improve the lives of farmers, participate in the struggle for land, and help to open schools in the most remote places and in the heart of the Sierra Maestra. These were all carried out under the circumstances of American-supplied napalm bombs and five-hundred-pound bombs flying around, murdering the Cuban people's executioners.

These loving reminiscences of mine are dedicated to our unforgettable comrades who were lost in the struggle for freedom. Their names inspire us like victory. "Freedom, freedom, freedom. Cuba, if you need it, we are willing to sacrifice."

    古巴革命中的妇女
    古巴妇女代表团团长  比奥莱塔·卡萨耳
    古巴是一块美丽的翡翠，土地富饶肥沃，是昨天的海盗和二十世纪的海盗垂涎的地方。古巴人民慷慨豪爽，从来没有不加反抗地容忍过强权。古巴的男人和妇女已经在历史上写下了英勇刚毅、自我牺牲和大公无私的光辉一章。只要简单地回顾一下，我们就可以看到，在我国美丽土地上早就存在着渴望自由的火种，并且在她最初的居民西博内伊人纯朴的心灵上发芽生长，他们宁死不愿做征服者的奴隶。虽然他们的棉制护胸根本抵挡不了殖民主义者的铁甲、洋枪和猎犬，但他们仍然赤手空拳地抗击了贪婪的冒险家。在被征服四百六十七年的今天，我们怀念着为了我们祖国的权利、正义和自由而牺牲的男人和妇女的名字。我国人民渴望并决心为争取掌握自己命运的权利而毫不畏缩地献出自己的生命。
    由于我国的土地富饶而又肥沃、美丽而又富于自然资源，贪得无餍的海盗的眼睛死盯住这块地方，他们的魔爪紧抓住这里不放，进行攫取和压榨。古巴人民最剧烈的浴血斗争就正是反对那些企图奴役和掠夺他们的人的斗争。
    我们在帝国主义身上找到了我国巨大灾祸的根源：过去历届政府屈从和服务于帝国主义的结果，使我国的独立成为有名无实。在美帝国主义扶植和保护下的各个血腥独裁者也给予我们无穷的苦难。我国经济随着美国市场行情涨落而波动。我国的土地被美国强盗霸占，我国农民无家可归，流落街头，无衣无食。这些就是过去这块富饶、多产、大自然给予特别优待的土地上的真实情况。但是，古巴的优秀儿女为争取自由、社会正义和重获民族尊严而慷慨付出了鲜血。他们决心克服困难，而不使荣誉受到任何损害。古巴的未来和古巴问题的解决不取决于自私自利的利益和国内外商人冷酷的算盘。终于，在我国男人和妇女面前，光辉的黎明已经来到了。
    1952年3月10日，独裁者巴蒂斯塔举行罪恶的政变企图夺取政权的活动，在全国各地激起了愤怒的斗争。就在这一天，古巴人民与践踏我国自由和民主准则的人进行了斗争。就在这一天，我国人民懂得美国大使馆的军事顾问和巴蒂斯塔一起进行了丑恶的活动。这就开始了痛苦和流血的斗争，人民开始在自己身上寻找力量，并且紧密地团结起来，他们只有一个愿望，一个意志：不自由毋宁死。
    从第一个艰苦的考验、1953年7月26日攻击蒙卡达兵营起，妇女就勇敢而坚决地把她们的力量和热情献给了革命。在教育和宣传工作上，古巴妇女卓有成效地完成了任务。随着斗争的加紧，妇女的队伍日益壮大，她们冒着危险进行宣传、募集基金，运输和收藏武器、搞工人运动。她们与她们的战斗弟兄肩并肩地对付共同的危险：一支配备有手枪和机枪、残酷的刑具，并且善于恶毒地运用这些工具的警察部队。这支警察部队在各警察局设有地下室，这些阴暗的地方都配备有最残酷的刑具；有为运输遇害者尸体用的大车，把尸体扔到公路上、被投入海中或秘密地埋葬，如果事前没有抛入酸液中溶解的话。此外，妇女还常常受到奸污和侮辱。但妇女们对酷刑、折磨和卑劣的残杀的回答是加紧团结，更加坚决和勇敢。他们景仰着一位崇高的古巴妇女的大无畏精神，这就是马塞奥兄弟的母亲玛丽亚娜·格拉哈莱斯，她在我们争取独立的战争中把她的孩子送上了疆场。出身贫苦的农妇玛丽亚娜·格拉哈莱斯是英雄们的母亲。我国的农村妇女都是这样的。我们的解放战争总是有妇女参加。她们亲身体验了威胁祖国的各种危险，参加过反对马查多独裁政权的斗争，英勇地打击了巴蒂斯塔独裁统治。巴蒂斯塔践踏祖国并且卑躬屈节地接二连三地把我们的富源和财产交给了保护他的外国利益集团，给祖国带来了新痛苦，古巴妇女对此自然不能无动于衷。古巴农村、城市以及马埃斯特腊山区荒山上的妇女都作了回答。她们在荒山里参加了工作，如护士、医生、通讯员、广播员、教师、起义军和民政机关的助手、以及社会劳动者和战斗员。起义军中的妇女从未忘记她们的根本使命：改善农民生活、参加争取土地的斗争，以及帮助在最荒僻的地方和马埃斯特腊山的心脏地区开办学校。这些都是在美国供给屠杀古巴人民的刽子手的凝固汽油弹和五百磅炸弹的横飞的情况下进行的。
    我这些充满热爱的回忆辞，是献给我们在争取自由的斗争中失去的永志不忘的战友们的。她们的名字像胜利一样地鼓舞着我们。“自由、自由、自由。古巴，假如你需要，我们甘愿牺牲。”
