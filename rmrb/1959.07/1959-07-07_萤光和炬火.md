    Some comrades look down on small achievements, always thinking they are too small to form a significant trend. So they fold their arms and just dream that one day, a great achievement will come like a ray of red light, descending from the sky and suddenly appearing before their eyes. Being dissatisfied with existing achievements and always wanting them to be bigger and bigger, this is helpful for accelerating socialist construction, which is of course a good thing. But to see small achievements as worthless and to see oneself as very clever, disdaining to do this or unwilling to do that, this is not right.
    In fact, achieving small accomplishments is also very difficult. Achievements, whether large or small, are the result of humanity exploring, understanding, and mastering the laws of development of objective things through revolutionary practice. Big achievements are made up of a collection of small achievements. There is small in the big, and big in the small. If you can discover and grasp the laws of development of "small" things, and through continuous summarization and improvement, and continuous investment in revolutionary practice, you can also further discover the laws of development of "big" things and make great achievements. Everything goes from low to high, from simple to complex, from small to large. To slight the small and value the great, to abandon the small and take the big, hoping to achieve "big" in one fell swoop without going through the "small" stage, this is unrealistic and will definitely lead to defeat.
    Big and small also do not have rigid standards. What you think is small is sometimes not small, and what you think is big may not really be big. Sometimes it is small compared to this thing, but big compared to that thing. Sometimes it looks small at first, but later it becomes big. When ancient humans first made a stone knife out of stone, it was only for cutting things and hunting wild animals. It was very "small," nothing surprising, but a decisive advancement appeared from then on. People's hands became more and more dexterous, and humans thus evolved from ape-men into humans. In 1730, the Englishman Wyatt invented the "roller spinning machine," which made the production capacity of spinning several times that of weaving. At that time, this may have been seen as merely improving production efficiency and reducing labor, and it didn't seem very "big." Unexpectedly, this led to the later so-called "industrial revolution," which promoted the invention of the steam engine from the reform of the textile industry, enabling the capitalist economy to develop by leaps and bounds. From this, it can be seen that the small is not necessarily small. When you have a small achievement in practice, others can learn from it, draw inferences from one instance, and take a step on the original basis, or even a decisive step. In this way, small achievements can be combined into big ones, and small things can become big.
    Not being satisfied with small achievements, we should go further, and we should have the ambition to strive for greater achievements. However, disregarding everything to abandon the small and take the big, even if you are diligent, conscientious, and fighting tirelessly, in the end, you will accomplish nothing. Usually, we say "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." The reason is often not that the strength is insufficient, but that the spirit is too willing, using too much energy to think wildly, always wanting to do things that objective conditions do not allow. Naturally, you will feel that the strength is insufficient. If you are down-to-earth, starting from the big picture and starting with the small things, you will be ambitious and have sufficient strength, and you will be able to do everything with ease. You will definitely be invincible and conquer everything.
    Lu Xun said in "Hot Wind": "I hope that Chinese youth will get rid of the cold air and just go upwards, and don't listen to the words of those who give up on themselves. Those who can do things should do things, and those who can speak should speak. If you have a bit of heat, emit a bit of light, even if it's like a firefly, you can emit a little light in the dark, without having to wait for a torch." Those who abandon the small and take the big, think about it, before the torch is lit, can't you first release more fireflies?

    萤光和炬火

    有些同志看不起小成绩，总以为太小了，难成大气候，于是乎袖起手来，只梦想有朝一日，大成绩会像一道红光，从天而降，突然出现在自己眼前。不满足于已有的成就，总想使它大一些，更大一些，这对加速社会主义建设是有作用的，这当然是好事。但将小成绩看得一钱不值，将自己看得非常高明，这不屑做，那不肯为，这就不对了。
    其实，小成绩的取得，也大不容易。成绩不论大小，都是人类通过革命实践，去摸索、认识、和掌握了客观事物发展规律的结果。大成绩是集合若干小成绩而成的，大中有小，小中有大，你能够发现和掌握“小”事物的发展规律，经过不断的总结提高，不断的投入革命实践，也可以进一步去发现“大”事物的发展规律，而做出大成绩来。什么事都是由低到高，由简到繁，由小到大的，轻小重大，弃小取大，希图不通过“小”的阶段而一蹴而成“大”，这是不切实际的，肯定是非吃败仗不可。
    大和小，也并没有死板的标准。你以为小，有时并不小，你以为大，其实也未必真正大；有时和这事比较是小了，而和那事比较又大了；有时最初看是小，后来看却大起来。古代人类第一个用石头造成石刀，当时只是为了砍东西和打野兽，“小”得很，没甚出奇，但是一个有决定性的进步却就从此出现了。人的手一天天灵巧起来，人类因此由类人猿发展而成为人。1730年英国人渥瓦德发明了“卷轴纺织机”，使纺纱的生产能力超过织布好几倍，当时看这事或者也不过是提高生产效率和减少劳力而已，并不见得怎么“大”，不想这却引起了后来的所谓“产业革命”，从纺织业的改革推动了蒸汽机的发明，使资本主义经济得到了飞跃的发展。由此可见，小者并不一定就小，你在实践中有了小成绩，别人就可以借镜，举一反三，在原有基础上跨出一步，甚至是决定性的一步，这样，就可以集小成大，从小变大。
    不满足于小小成绩，应该百尺竿头更进一步，应该有争取更大成绩的雄心。但是，不顾一切地弃小取大，即使你是勤勤恳恳、苦战不休，到头来还是一事无成。平常我们说“心有余而力不足”，原因往往不在力不足，而在心有余，过多地用余心去胡思乱想，尽想做些主客观条件所不允许的事，自然就感到力不足了，假如踏实一点从大处着眼而又从小处着手，就会心雄力足，得心应手，一定是战无不胜，攻无不克的。
    鲁迅在“热风”里说：“愿中国青年都摆脱冷气，只是向上走，不必听自暴自弃者流的话。能做事的做事，能发声的发声。有一分热，发一分光，就令萤火一般，也可以在黑暗里发一点光，不必等候炬火。”弃小取大的人，想想看，在没有发出炬火以前，不是也可以先多放一些萤光的吗？
