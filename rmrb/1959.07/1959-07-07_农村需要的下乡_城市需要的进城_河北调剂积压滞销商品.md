    The Countryside Needs Goods Sent Down, The City Needs Goods Coming In
    Hebei Regulates Overstocked and Slow-Moving Commodities
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 6th: After clearing their warehouses, commercial departments at all levels in Hebei Province held exchange meetings to regulate overstocked and slow-moving commodities. At a recent exchange meeting convened by the Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce, more than 60% of the overstocked commodities cleared by commercial departments in various localities were regulated and sold on the market.

    The total value of overstocked commodities cleared by commercial departments at all levels in Hebei Province was more than 100.3 million yuan, including more than 3,500 varieties of large-scale agricultural machinery, irrigation and drainage machinery, telephones, sewing machines, bicycles, radios, wires, and cables. Most of these commodities were overstocked due to unreasonable distribution. For example, in areas without power sources such as Daming, Zhangbei, Julu, and Yi County, a large number of wires, light bulbs, automatic telephones, etc., were overstocked; in counties such as Quzhou, a lot of high-grade silks and satins, radios and other commodities suitable for cities were overstocked.

    Through the regulation of the materials exchange meeting, many overstocked commodities have been transferred to areas in need. High-grade silks and satins, radios, fluorescent lamps, motorcycles, and other commodities overstocked in rural areas have been transferred to cities, increasing the supply in cities. Qinhuangdao City needed hinges, but Yi County had a lot in stock. Now Yi County has transferred 5,000 dozen hinges to support Qinhuangdao. Baoding Department Store's second-level wholesale station had a batch of ballasts for fluorescent lamps in stock, but lacked tubes. Tangshan Department Store's wholesale station had tubes but no ballasts. Both parties could not sell because they could not be matched. At the exchange meeting, Baoding took out 6,000 ballasts, and Tangshan took out 10,000 tubes, mutually regulating each other, so that this batch of commodities was matched into sets and sold on the market.
  Let Overstocked Goods Play Their Role
    The commodities produced by the production departments must be supplied to production units or consumers through the commercial departments. If these commodities are overstocked in the commercial departments, the purpose of making the best use of everything cannot be achieved.

    Although the stagnation of the circulation of certain commodities is an individual phenomenon, it cannot but arouse due attention. Because what is overstocked in this place is often what is lacking and urgently needed in other places. After clearing their warehouses, the commercial departments in Hebei Province communicated what they had and didn't have through the materials exchange meeting, overcame the phenomenon of commodity overstocking, met the needs of consumption, and promoted production. This is a very good example.

### 农村需要的下乡　城市需要的进城  河北调剂积压滞销商品

    农村需要的下乡　城市需要的进城
    河北调剂积压滞销商品
    据新华社天津6日电　河北省各级商业部门在清理仓库以后，举办交流会，调剂积压和滞销的商品。河北省商业厅在最近召开的一次交流会上，把各地商业部门清理出来的积压商品的60％以上，加以调剂，在市场上销售。
    河北省各地商业部门在清仓中清理出来的积压商品总值共一亿零三百多万元，包括有大型农业机械、排灌机械、电话机、缝纫机、自行车、收音机、电线、电缆等三千五百多种。这些商品大部分是因为摆布不合理而积压的。如大名、张北、巨鹿、易县等没有电源地区，积压了大批电线、电灯泡、自动电话机等；曲周等县，积压了不少城市适销的高级绸缎、收音机等商品。
    经过物资交流会的调剂，许多积压商品已经调运到需要的地区去。农村积压的高级绸缎、收音机、日光灯、摩托车等商品，都调剂给城市，增加了城市的供应量。秦皇岛市需要合页，而易县仓库里存了很多，现在易县已调剂五千打合页支援秦皇岛。保定百货二级批发站积存了一批日光灯上的镇流器，但是缺少灯管，唐山百货批发站有灯管而无镇流器，双方都因配不成套不能出售。在交流会上，保定拿出六千个镇流器，唐山拿出一万个灯管，互相调剂，使这批商品配成了套在市场上出售。
  让积压的商品发挥作用
    生产部门生产出来商品，都要通过商业部门供应给生产单位或消费者。如果这些商品积压在商业部门，就不能达到物尽其用的目的。
    某些商品流通停滞，虽然是一种个别的现象，但不能不引起应有的注意。因为这个地方积压的东西，常常是别的地方缺少的和急需的。河北省商业部门清仓以后，通过物资交流会沟通了有无，克服了商品积压现象，满足了消费的需要，促进了生产。就是一个很好的事例。
