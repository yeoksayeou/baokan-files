Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 25th: A report from the "Lao Patriotic Newspaper of Xieng Khouang" on July 18th states that since June 15th, the army of the Lao Kingdom's Phoui Sananikone government has launched approximately twenty-five or more attacks in Xieng Khouang province against the former Lao Patriotic Combat Forces Second Battalion.

In Phong Saly province, the Sananikone government's army, since the beginning of June, has been searching day and night in the area from Nam Ngô to Muang Khoua and from Hui Sang to Ha Long for personnel of the former Lao Patriotic Combat Forces or former Lao Patriotic Combat Forces soldiers who have already been demobilized. In Khammouane province, the Sananikone government is increasing its troops to strengthen guard posts, creating an atmosphere of terror.

The report says that while attacking the former Lao Patriotic Combat Forces, the Sananikone government's army is looting the people's property everywhere or forcing the people to sell goods at below-cost prices. In places like Pinh Xeo and Nam Pui, the Sananikone government's army stole eggs from local residents and shot residents' pigs with guns.

With the assistance of local residents, the former Lao Patriotic Combat Forces Second Battalion heroically resisted the Sananikone government's army. From July 1st to 9th, twenty soldiers of the Sananikone government's army were killed and many injured in various locations in Xieng Khouang province.

People in various parts of Laos are also taking other measures to resist the Sananikone government army's atrocities. In Xieng Khouang province, when government troops arrive, local residents take their belongings and hide in the forests. In Saravane province, local residents held demonstrations with iron spears and bamboo spears. In Sam Neua province, the people have also risen up to resist the Sananikone government army's terror searches and persecution.

    新华社河内25日电　老挝川圹消息：据“川圹老挝爱国报”7月18日报道，老挝王国培·萨纳尼空政府的军队从6月15日以来，在川圹省向前寮国战斗部队第二营发动了大约二十五次以上的进攻。
    在丰沙里省，萨纳尼空政府的军队从6月初起，在从南峨到芒苛、从会桑到哈龙一带地区日夜搜索前寮国战斗部队人员或者已经复员的前寮国战斗部队士兵。在坎蒙省，萨纳尼空政府正在增派军队加强岗哨，制造恐怖气氛。
    消息说，萨纳尼空政府的军队在进攻前寮国战斗部队的同时，到处抢劫人民的财物，或者强迫人民以低于成本的价格出售货物。在宾虚乔和南皮等地，萨纳尼空政府的军队偷走当地居民的鸡蛋，用枪打死居民的猪。
    前寮国战斗部队第二营在当地居民的协助下，英勇地抗击萨纳尼空政府的军队。从7月1日到9日，萨纳尼空政府的军队在川圹省各地有二十人被打死，许多人受伤。
    老挝各地人民还采取其他方式来反抗萨纳尼空政府军队的暴行。在川圹省，在政府军队到达的时候，当地居民纷纷带着自己的财物躲到森林里去。在沙加唝省，当地居民拿着铁矛和竹枪举行示威。在桑怒省，人民也起来反抗萨纳尼空政府军队的恐怖搜查和迫害。
