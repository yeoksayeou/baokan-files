Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 30th. The output of raw coal from the three major coal mines in Heilongjiang Province, Hegang, Shuangyashan, and Jixi, is steadily increasing. In mid-July, the average daily output of the three mines increased by 6,000 tons compared to the first ten days of the month. The average output for the first seven days of the last ten days of the month increased by another 5,121 tons compared to mid-July. Ten pairs of mines including Hegang Xingshan Mine No. 2 Well, four open-pit coal mines, and Shuangyashan Sifangtai Coal Mine have all completed their July raw coal production plans ahead of schedule, and will produce tens of thousands of tons of extra coal for the country this month.

In July, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the staff and workers in each mining area carried out a socialist labor competition centered on large-scale bumper harvests. The staff and workers of Hegang Nanshan Mine No. 1 Well solved key production problems such as transportation and electromechanical issues in the competition. After July 15, the daily output of raw coal increased from more than 1,100 tons to more than 1,500 tons. Some major coal mining faces in No. 5 Well and No. 3 Well solved the problems of high pressure and poor roof conditions in the competition, and the daily output also increased by 20% to 50% compared to the first half of the month. The 121 coal mining face of Hegang Xingshan Mine No. 2 Well has not been producing well in the past and has not reached the level of producing 10,000 tons of coal per month. In July, the miners put forward many rationalization proposals, implemented a system of dedicated personnel for maintenance and regular inspection of combine harvesters and transportation machinery, and promoted the experience of rapid transfer of scraper conveyors. From July 1 to 28, the production increased by 2,100 tons of coal compared with the entire month of June, reaching the production level of 10,000 tons of coal per month. In early July, Party and government leading cadres in Heilongjiang Province formed a working group to go deep into Jixi, Hegang, and Shuangyashan to inspect production. Cadres from the bureau level to the various pit entrances of each mining bureau went down to the mines and into the pits, working alongside the workers and directing production, solving problems in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 30th. The Bijagang water mining well of Huainan Coal Mine overfulfilled the July coal production plan four days ahead of schedule. From July 1 to 28, the average daily output increased by more than 24% compared to the plan. At present, the staff and workers of this mine are striving to produce several thousand tons more coal for the country before the end of the month. They are determined to increase the coal production in August compared to July.

At the beginning of July, the staff and workers of this mine launched a new upsurge of socialist labor competition. They generally formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and proposed specific measures for completing the plan. The Party Secretary, the mine manager, and the chief engineer of this mine also went deep into the well and key units such as electromechanical transportation, timely discovering and solving various specific problems in production, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the staff and workers. They tapped the potential of equipment, carried out technical innovation, and strived to improve production. Water gun operator Hu Changdian improved the mining procedure, so that the amount of coal mined by one water gun per shift increased from about 500 tons to 805 tons.

Ensuring the safe operation of various transportation machinery and equipment is also an important reason for the increase in the output of this mine. In the past, many accidents with mechanical equipment affected the improvement of the production level. In July, they transferred more than 30 electromechanical workers and management cadres to form a coal-water pump repair team, which was specially responsible for the maintenance and repair of transportation machinery and equipment. At the same time, they regularly repaired all mechanical equipment, implemented a responsibility system, and strictly implemented the handover acceptance system to ensure normal production.

### 黑龙江三大煤矿产量上升  淮南毕家岗水采矿井提前完成七月份采煤计划

    黑龙江三大煤矿产量上升
    淮南毕家岗水采矿井提前完成七月份采煤计划
    新华社哈尔滨30日电　黑龙江省鹤岗、双鸭山、鸡西三大煤矿原煤产量稳步上升。7月中旬，三个矿的平均日产量比上旬增加六千吨，下旬前七天的平均产量，又比中旬增多五千一百二十一吨。鹤岗兴山矿二井等十对矿井、四个露天煤矿和双鸭山四方台煤矿都已提前完成了7月份原煤生产计划，全月将给国家增产好几万吨煤炭。
    7月份，各矿区职工在各级党委的领导下，深入开展了以大面积丰产为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛。鹤岗南山矿一井的职工们在竞赛中解决了运输、机电等生产关键问题，7月15日以后，原煤日产量由一千一百多吨提高到一千五百多吨以上，五井、三井一些主要采煤工作面在竞赛中解决了压力大、顶板不好的问题，日产量也比前半月提高20％到50％。鹤岗兴山矿二井一二一采煤工作面，过去生产一直不大好，没有达到月产万吨煤的水平。7月份，矿工们提出了许多合理化建议，实行了专人专职维护和定期检修康拜因、运输机械的制度，推广了快速挪刮板运输机等经验。从7月1日到28日，比6月份全月增产了二千一百吨煤，达到了月产万吨煤的生产水平。黑龙江省的党政领导干部7月上旬组成工作组，深入鸡西、鹤岗、双鸭山检查生产。各矿务局从局一级直到各坑口的干部，都分别下矿下井，一面跟班劳动，一面指挥生产，发现问题及时解决。
    新华社合肥30日电　淮南煤矿毕家岗水采矿井提前四天超额完成了7月份的产煤计划。7月1日到28日，平均日产量比计划提高了24％以上。目前，这个矿井的职工们正争取在月底以前，再为国家多生产几千吨煤炭。并决心使8月份的产煤量比7月份再有提高。
    7月份一开始，这个矿的职工就掀起了新的社会主义劳动竞赛高潮。他们普遍制订了增产节约计划，提出了完成计划的具体措施。这个矿的党委书记、矿长、总工程师也深入井下和机电运输等重点单位，及时地发现和解决生产中的各种具体问题，大大鼓舞了职工的生产积极性。他们挖掘设备潜力，开展技术革新，努力提高生产。水枪司机胡长典改进了开采程序，使一台水枪每班的采煤量由原来的五百吨上下提高到八百零五吨。
    保证各种运输机械设备的安全运转，也是这个矿井产量提高的一个重要原因。过去由于机械设备事故多，影响了生产水平的提高。7月份他们抽调三十多名机电工人和管理干部组成煤水泵检修大队，专门负责运输机械设备的维护和检修工作，同时定期检修所有机械设备，贯彻责任制度，严格执行交接班验收制度等，保证了生产正常进行。（附图片）
