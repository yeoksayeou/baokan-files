Early Preparations Lead to Faster Procurement:
Over 5 Million Jin of New Ramie Enters Warehouses in Guangdong and Other Provinces

    (Reported by this newspaper) The first batch of ramie is already on the market. According to statistics from seven provinces and regions, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Jiangxi, more than 5.71 million jin of ramie have been purchased, an increase of 90% compared to the national purchase figure for the same period last year.
    The ramie in all areas is growing very well this year. In order to welcome the peak season for first-batch ramie production, commercial departments in the ramie-producing areas strengthened preparations for ramie procurement before the new ramie came onto the market. Under the attention and leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, they actively carried out preparations for ramie procurement. In addition to adjusting grassroots purchasing stations, strengthening the purchasing staff, and renting civilian houses, ancestral halls, and temples as warehouses, some areas also combined ramie production with on-site technical innovation meetings, vigorously promoting relatively advanced ramie scraping machines. For example, Lan Jia County in Hunan Province set up 179 purchasing stations and points, equipped with more than 300 purchasing cadres and more than 280 processing personnel. In the key ramie-producing areas, basically every commune had a station and every team had a point, and the stations and points were all staffed with purchasing and processing personnel. At the same time, the stations and points were also required to do a good job in "four fixings" (fixed personnel, fixed locations, fixed times, fixed tasks), "four guarantees" (guaranteed purchase, payment, processing, and transportation), and "five grasps" (grasping mass ideology, ramie harvesting progress, second-batch ramie cultivation, transportation links, and seizing every opportunity) to achieve the five "quick" requirements of quick harvesting, quick sales, quick purchase, quick processing, and quick transfer. The commercial and agricultural departments of Hubei Province jointly held an on-site meeting in late May, vigorously promoting the 59-1 model and other relatively advanced ramie scraping tools. Ramie-producing areas in Guizhou, Hunan, and other places have also carried out ramie harvesting and stripping preparations and promoted ramie scraping tools. The commercial department of Pingjiang County in Hunan Province also actively helped the people's communes arrange preparations for scraping and drying ramie in rainy weather. Thanks to the timely preparations made in various places, the progress of ramie procurement has been accelerated.
    In order to strive for a greater harvest of second-batch ramie, while arranging the harvesting of the first-batch ramie, all localities have paid more attention to the cultivation of second-batch ramie. At present, in some areas where the first-batch ramie has been harvested earlier, the second-batch ramie seedlings are showing a lush green and growing well.

    准备工作做得早收购进度快
    广东等省五百多万斤新麻入库
    本报讯　1959年生产的苎麻头麻已经上市。据广东、广西、湖南、湖北、四川、贵州、江西七个省区统计，已收购苎麻五百七十一万多斤，比去年同期全国收购实数增长了90％。
    今年各地的苎麻头麻生长得都很好。为了迎接头麻生产旺季，在新苎麻上市以前，各苎麻产区的商业部门就加强了麻类收购准备工作。在各级党委和政府的重视和领导下，积极地进行了收购苎麻的准备工作，除调整了基层采购站，充实了采购干部，租用民房、祠堂、庙宇备作仓库外，有些地区还结合搞好苎麻生产召开了技术革新现场会，大力推广了比较先进的刮麻机。例如湖南省蓝嘉县共设置了采购站、点一百七十九个，配备了三百多采购干部，二百八十多名加工人员，在苎麻重点产区基本上达到了社社有站、队队有点，站、点都设有采购、加工人员。同时对各个站、点还规定了做好四定（定人员、定地点、定时间、定任务）、四包（包收购、付款、加工、运输）、五抓（抓群众思想、割麻进度、二麻培育、运输环节、见缝插针），以实现快收割，快交售，快收购，快加工，快调运的五快要求。湖北省商业和农业部门在5月下旬联合召开了现场会，大力推广了59—1型等比较先进的刮麻工具。贵州、湖南等地苎麻产区也都进行了苎麻收剥准备工作和刮麻工具推广工作。湖南平江县的商业部门还积极帮助人民公社安排了雨天刮制、烘烤苎麻的准备工作。由于各地及时地做好了各项准备工作，也就加快了苎麻收购进度。
    为了力争苎麻二麻更大丰收，各地在安排收割头麻的同时，更注意到对二麻的培育工作。目前，有些头麻收割较早的地区，二麻麻苗已呈现一片葱绿，生长情况很好。
