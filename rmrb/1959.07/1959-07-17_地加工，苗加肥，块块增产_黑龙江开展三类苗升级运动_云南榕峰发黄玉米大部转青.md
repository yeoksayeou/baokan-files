(Our newspaper, Harbin, 16th) The people's communes in Heilongjiang Province are seizing the favorable opportunity after the rain to fully carry out the three types of seedling upgrade campaign, striving to increase the unit area yield of crops and achieve an all-round bumper harvest of various crops this year.

At present, most of the 100 million mu of various crops in the province are growing well. The famous Heilongjiang soybeans are neatly planted and growing very well.

However, some areas have experienced drought and natural disasters such as wind, frost, insects, and hail to varying degrees. Seedlings on about 13 million mu of land in the province appeared to be of the three types. Since late June, widespread rainfall has begun to alleviate the drought, providing extremely favorable conditions for eliminating the three types of seedlings. Grasping the favorable opportunity after the rain, all parts of the province, under the slogan of "Grasp the three types of seedlings firmly to ensure all seedlings," have fully launched the three types of seedling upgrade campaign. Bayan County began on July 5th, mobilizing 132,000 people to conduct a comprehensive survey of the three types of seedlings in the entire county within five days. They also applied one more fertilizer application and hoed one to two more times than usual. At the beginning of July, Kedong County organized manpower to strengthen field management. Within three days, all 36,000 mu of the three types of seedlings were upgraded. Yian, Tailai, Fangzheng, Fuyu, Yanshou, Shangzhi, and other counties, which were severely affected by drought, quickly carried out activities such as field inspection, replanting, destruction of seedlings, and transplanting seedlings after the drought was relieved. As of now, the province has replanted 7.43 million mu and destroyed 1.8 million mu. (Chen Baoyu)

(Our newspaper, Kunming, 16th) The 120,000 agricultural workers in Rongfeng County, Yunnan Province, have taken measures such as ditching for drainage and applying quick-acting, heat-generating fertilizers, in response to the characteristics of heavy rainfall and low soil temperature this summer. This has caused more than 73,000 mu of yellowing corn in the county to gradually turn green and black.

Rongfeng County, with its many mountainous areas, has experienced continuous heavy rains since entering the mid-cultivation summer hoeing season. The rainfall is 4.1 times that of the same period last year. Due to excessive water accumulation, the soil temperature is also two degrees Celsius lower than last year, resulting in yellowing of the corn. The Rongfeng County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately organized cadres, veteran farmers, technicians, and administrators in 25 people's communes to go to the fields together. Based on soil quality, seedling growth, and base fertilizer conditions, they conducted a seedling ranking and identified measures to eliminate the three types of seedlings based on local conditions. From the county party committee to the communes and management areas, there was a party committee secretary specifically responsible for grasping the work of eliminating the three types of seedlings. The entire county organized professional teams with more than 50% of the labor force and put forward the action slogan of "Clear thousands of ditches, protect ten thousand mu of seedlings, and seize a bumper harvest." After the Huajiao People's Commune mobilized the masses to drain water and apply fertilizer, more than 2,000 mu of the three types of corn seedlings turned green. In Dongshan People's Commune, where the three types of seedlings accounted for 30%, the masses, with the spirit of making way for heavy rain, working in light rain, and making concentrated efforts on sunny days, opened ditches for drainage and applied more than 6,000 jin of human and animal manure per mu. Now, a large area has turned green.

In the process of ditching for drainage and eliminating the three types of seedlings, Rongfeng County widely absorbed the experience of the masses and adopted a variety of drainage methods based on local conditions. In the plains, the method of opening ditches around the perimeter was used to allow water to flow out from all directions. In mountainous areas, hidden ditches were opened to prevent rainwater erosion. On sloping land, ditches were opened from the upper ridge to block mountain floods. In concave land, ditches were opened from the middle, and in pot-bottom-shaped land, ponds were dug at the bottom to drain water.

Now, more than 73,000 mu of yellowing corn in the county have gradually turned green and black after drainage and application of human and animal manure, farmyard manure, lime, and other fertilizers. The commune members are applying the second fertilizer, striving to completely and thoroughly eliminate the three types of seedlings. (Ma Lie)

    黑龙江开展三类苗升级运动
    云南榕峰发黄玉米大部转青
    本报哈尔滨16日电　黑龙江省各地人民公社正抓紧雨后有利时机，全面开展三类苗升级运动，力争提高农作物单位面积产量，争取今年各种作物全面丰收。
    现在，全省一亿亩各种作物大部分禾苗生育良好。著名的黑龙江省大豆苗齐地净，生长的很好。
    但是，部分地区曾发生旱情和不同程度的风、冻、虫、雹等自然灾害，全省大约有一千三百多万亩地块上的禾苗出现三类苗。6月下旬以来普遍降雨，旱象开始解除，这对消除三类苗提供了极有利的条件。全省各地抓住雨后有利时机，在“狠抓三类苗，保证全苗”的口号下，全面开展了三类苗升级运动。巴彦县7月5日开始出动十三万二千多人，五天之内普查完全县三类苗，并比一般苗多追了一次肥，多趟了一遍到二遍。克东县7月初开始组织人力加强田间管理，三天之内，三万六千亩三类苗都升了级。旱情较严重的依安、泰来、方正、富裕、延寿、尚志等县解除旱象后，迅速开展了查田补种、毁种和移苗补苗活动。截至目前为止，全省已补种七百四十三万亩，毁种一百八十万亩。　（陈宝玉）
    本报昆明16日电　云南省榕峰县十二万农业大军，针对今夏雨量多、地温低的特点，用开沟排水和追施速效热性肥料等办法，已经使全县七万三千多亩回黄的玉米陆续返青转黑。
    山地众多的榕峰县，自从进入中耕夏锄以来，大雨连日不断，降雨量为去年同期的四点一倍。由于积水太多，地温也比去年低摄氏两度，造成玉米萎黄现象。中共榕峰县委立即在二十五个人民公社组织了干部、老农、技术员、管理员一齐下地，根据土质、苗稞、底肥等情况，进行禾苗排队，因地制宜的找出了消灭三类苗的措施。从县委到公社、管理区都有一个党委书记专门抓消灭三类苗的工作，全县以50％以上的劳动力组织专业队伍，提出了“疏通千条沟，保住万亩苗，夺取大丰收”的行动口号。花椒人民公社，发动群众排水、追肥以后，两千多亩玉米三类苗变得绿油油的。三类苗达30％的东山人民公社，群众以大雨让路，小雨上阵，晴天突击的精神，开沟排涝，每亩施了人畜粪肥六千多斤，现在已经大面积的回青转绿。
    榕峰县在开沟排水，消灭三类苗时，广泛吸取了群众的经验，因地制宜地采取了多种多样的排涝方法。在平地，采用周围开沟的办法，让水从四面八方流出去。山地开暗沟，以防止雨水冲刷。斜坡地从上埂开沟，拦断山洪水。凹地从中间开沟，锅底形的地从锅底打塘排水。
    现在，全县七万三千多亩发黄的玉米，经过排水、追施人畜厩肥、石灰等肥料，已经陆续回青转黑。社员们正在追施第二次肥料，力争彻底全面地消灭三类苗。
