    Cold War Warrior

    After playing a farce of vying for the West German chancellorship, Adenauer brazenly said on June 14th in Munich—the same place where Hitler delivered speeches more than thirty years ago: "I would rather be the last Cold War warrior than the first to surrender."
    "Cold War warrior," what a "grand" and intimidating title! Churchill, who invented the term "Cold War," never dared to call himself a Cold War warrior; Dulles, who was most enthusiastic about conducting the Cold War, did not dare to put on this "glorious laurel" until his death. Adenauer is indeed a descendant of Hitler, and he actually stepped forward to make his "grand ambition" public. Churchill, Dulles, and their ilk pale in comparison.
    The Cold War is no stranger to people. Because of the Cold War, the broad masses of people in capitalist countries are gasping under the heavy pressure of the arms race and living in the terror of war hysteria. Because of the Cold War, many countries, including Adenauer's homeland—Germany—have been artificially divided into two parts. Because of the Cold War, not only have international relations been poisoned, but there is also a danger of it turning into a hot war in some places… That is why people all over the world hate the Cold War as they hate the plague and defend peace as they defend their lives.
    In order to extinguish the glimmer of hope for peace brought to people by the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference, Adenauer openly challenged peace-loving people all over the world, defying the great disapproval of the world, and put this most shameful and hateful title on his own head. His madness and stubbornness have reached the extreme.
    At first glance, this West German Chancellor seems to have a "hard bone," but that is not the case. Look, isn't he also talking about surrender? People can't help but wonder why he is so nervous and mentally strained. Neither the Soviet Union nor the German Democratic Republic has ever demanded Adenauer's surrender. Instead, they have demanded changing the abnormal state of West Berlin, which breeds the danger of war, ending the Cold War, concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and the two Germanys concluding a treaty of non-aggression and reunification on the basis of peace and democracy, etc. What does this have to do with surrender? Does the people's desire for peace necessarily mean Adenauer's surrender? Adenauer is too afraid of peace and too guilty. How outwardly strong but inwardly weak!
    Of course, we understand that Adenauer and his predecessor Hitler appeared on the German political stage one after another not by accident. It is the product of the social and historical conditions of Germany in the 20th century and a violent outbreak of the symptoms of dying capitalism. However, today's Germany and today's world have undergone earth-shaking changes compared to Hitler's era: the forces of peace have greatly surpassed the forces of war, and the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind. Adenauer says he wants to be the last Cold War warrior, which is probably true, because Cold War warriors will become extinct in the future. Chairman Mao has already pointed out that because imperialism has done too many bad things, its lifespan is not very long. However, I don't think it is time to draw a final conclusion about Adenauer's "no surrender."

    冷战战士
    润荃
    阿登纳在扮演了一出争夺西德总理宝座的丑剧之后，6月14日在三十多年前希特勒发表过演说的地方——慕尼黑，大言不惭地说：“我宁愿做最后一个冷战战士，而不愿做第一个投降的人。”
      “冷战战士”，这名号好不“堂皇”煞人也！发明“冷战”一词的丘吉尔，始终没有敢自封为冷战战士；最热心于进行冷战的杜勒斯，直到死也没有敢给自己戴上这顶“光荣的桂冠”，阿登纳不愧是希特勒的后代，居然挺身而出，向人们公开了自己的“宏愿”。丘吉尔、杜勒斯之流要相形失色了。
    冷战，对人们并不陌生。由于冷战，资本主义国家的广大人民喘息在军备竞赛的重压下，生活在战争歇斯底里的恐怖中。由于冷战，好些国家，其中也包括阿登纳的祖国——德国，被人为地分裂为两个部分。由于冷战，不仅毒化了国际关系，在有的地方，更有化为热战的危险……所以全世界人民才都像憎恨瘟疫一样地憎恨冷战，像捍卫生命一样捍卫和平。
    阿登纳为了扑灭日内瓦外长会议带给人们的一线和平希望，公然向全世界爱好和平的人民进行挑战，甘冒天下之大不韪，把这个最可耻、最可憎的名号冠在自己头上。其疯狂和顽固可谓到了极点。
    乍看起来，这位西德总理，好像真的有一副“硬骨头”，其实不然，你看，他不是也谈到了投降么。人们不禁奇怪，他为什么如此神经过敏和精神紧张。不管苏联也好，德意志民主共和国也好，从来也没有要求阿登纳投降，而是要求改变西柏林的孕育着战争危险的不正常状态，要求结束冷战，要求缔结对德和约，要求两个德国缔结互不侵犯条约和在和平、民主的基础上重新统一等等。这又和投降不投降有什么关系呢？难道人们要和平就必定是阿登纳的投降么？阿登纳未免太害怕和平了，太心虚了。何其色厉而内荏乎！
    我们当然明白，阿登纳和他的前身希特勒先后出现在德国政治舞台上，并不是一个偶然的现象，它是二十世纪德国社会历史条件的产物，是垂危的资本主义病症的猛烈发作。不过，今天的德国，今天的世界，和希特勒的时代比，已发生了天翻地复的变化：和平的力量已大大超过战争的力量，东风在继续压倒西风。阿登纳说要当最后一个冷战战士，这十有八九可能是对的，因为冷战战士将来是会绝种的；毛主席不是已经指出：由于坏事做得太多，帝国主义的寿命已经不太长久了。不过阿登纳说的“不投降”，我看还没有到了盖棺论定的时候。
