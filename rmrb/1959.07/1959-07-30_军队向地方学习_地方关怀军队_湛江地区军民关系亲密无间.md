The army in the Zhanjiang area of Guangdong Province has, for the past three years, frequently and proactively participated in the local people's social struggles and production struggles, learning from the people, greatly enhancing the ideological awareness of the officers and soldiers, promoting the work of the troops in all aspects, and further strengthening the relationship between the army and the people.

In recent years, the troops stationed in this area have actively participated in the central tasks and socialist construction of the localities at various stages. The responsible comrades of the Party committees at all levels of the troops in this area have participated in the corresponding local Party committees in their place of residence. They often participate in meetings of local Party and government organs to discuss the Party's policies and to arrange and implement work in industry, agriculture, culture, and education. At the same time, they proactively report military work to local Party and government comrades. This has greatly increased the understanding of the army cadres on social conditions and improved their policy thinking. Local cadres have also gained a more comprehensive understanding of the army's work and often care for the army's work.

In order to support local work and train cadres, in recent years, the troops stationed in this area have transferred a large number of cadres to form medical, political and legal, rural construction, and other work teams, which work under the leadership of local Party committees. The total number of these work teams accounts for more than 80% of the cadres of this unit, and most comrades have been trained in practical work in rural areas. When local work requires strong support from the troops, they also send a large number of officers and soldiers to participate in major project construction, such as the Youth Canal on the Leizhou Peninsula and the Zhanjiang Seawall Project, without affecting the work of the troops. On the construction sites, the officers and soldiers are both a labor army and a learning army. In their joint labor with the people, they learn from the people's socialist labor attitude and construction enthusiasm.

They have systematically brought the troops to factories and rural areas for visits, helped with production, invited local cadres to give reports, used the large amount of vivid materials collected to hold 186 large and small exhibitions, and invited local cadres, the masses, and family members to give reports to the troops more than 100 times.

In the past two years, many officers and soldiers have subscribed to newspapers from their hometowns. Some companies have many soldiers whose hometowns are scattered in a certain county or commune, so the leadership proactively sends letters to these counties or communes and maintains frequent contact with them. Many officers and soldiers communicate with their hometown communes. The materials in the hometown newspapers and periodicals of the soldiers and the letters from local Party and government cadres have become the most vivid teaching materials for the troops' education. In addition, many business departments of this unit have also visited the corresponding business departments of local Party and government organs to consult them and improve themselves.

In the process of working and laboring with the masses, the officers and soldiers have also strengthened their class viewpoint, labor viewpoint, and mass viewpoint. For example, rural cadres use class analysis methods to study the attitude of various classes towards the people's communes, thereby carrying out work, which has greatly educated the troops' cadres. The people's high revolutionary spirit and communist style have also inspired the troops' fighting will and communist spirit of cooperation. The Fourth Detachment of a certain unit was deeply moved when they saw mutual support between communes during field training. Later, when the Second Battalion achieved good shooting results, it proactively introduced its experience to the First and Third Battalions. When the First Battalion lacked telephones and telephone lines, the Third Battalion immediately sent telephone lines, and the Second Battalion also sent the best telephone sets to the First Battalion. The army and the people working and laboring together have also strengthened the unity between the army and the people and between the army and local cadres.

Now, mutual learning between the army and local cadres has become a common practice in this unit.

    军队向地方学习　地方关怀军队
    湛江地区军民关系亲密无间
    本报讯　广东省湛江地区驻军，三年来经常主动地参加当地人民群众的社会斗争和生产斗争，向人民群众学习，大大地提高了广大指战员的思想觉悟，推动了部队的各项工作，同时，进一步密切了军民之间的关系。
    几年来，这个地区的驻军部队积极地参加了地方各个时期的中心工作和社会主义建设。这个地区的部队各级党委负责同志都参加了驻地相应的地方党委。他们经常参加地方党政机关讨论党的政策，布置和执行工农业文化教育工作等的会议。同时又主动向地方党政同志报告军事工作。这就大大增加了军队干部对社会情况的了解，提高政策思想水平，地方干部也对军队工作有了较全面的了解，经常关怀军队工作。
    为了支援地方工作和锻炼干部，几年来，这个地区的驻军抽调了大批干部，组成了医疗、政法、农村建设等工作队，在地方党委的领导下，下乡工作。这些工作队的总人数，占这个部队干部的80％以上，大部分同志都在农村经过了实际工作的锻炼。当地方工作需要部队大力支援的时候，他们还在不影响部队工作的前提下，派出大批官兵参加重大工程建设。如雷州半岛的青年运河、湛江堵海工程等等，他们都积极参加。在工地上，官兵们既是劳动大军，又是学习大军。在和人民群众共同劳动中，他们向人民群众学习社会主义的劳动态度和建设热情。
    他们有计划地把部队带到工厂和农村中参观访问，帮助生产；请地方干部作报告；利用收集到的大量生动材料，举办了大小一百八十六个展览会；邀请地方干部、群众和家属给部队作报告达一百多人次。
    近两年来，很多官兵都订了自己家乡的报纸。有些连队的很多战士的家乡分散在某一个县或某一个公社，领导上就主动给这些县或公社去信，和他们经常联系，许多官兵都和家乡的公社通信。战士家乡报刊上的材料和地方党政干部的来信，都成为部队教育最生动的教材。此外，这个部队的许多业务部门，还访问了地方党政机关相应的业务部门，向他们请教，来提高自己。
    广大官兵在同群众一起工作和劳动中，也增强了阶级观点、劳动观点和群众观点。例如，农村干部以阶级分析方法，研究各阶层对人民公社的态度，从而进行工作，对部队干部教育很大。人民群众高涨的革命干劲和共产主义风格，也鼓舞了部队的战斗意志和共产主义协作精神。某单位四支队在野营中，看到公社与公社之间相互支援，很受感动。以后，二营射击成绩好，便主动向一、三营介绍经验。一营缺电话机、电话线，三营立刻送去电话线，二营也把最好的电话机送到一营。军民一齐工作一齐劳动，也增进了军民之间、军队与地方干部之间的团结。
    现在，军队和地方干部互相学习，已经成为这个部队的普遍风气。
