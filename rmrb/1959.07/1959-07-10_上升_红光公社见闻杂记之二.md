    Ascent
    —Excerpts from a Visit to the Red Light Commune, Part Two
    Tian Liu
    It’s true that seeing is believing. Before I came to Sichuan Province, I had heard about the prosperous lives of the people in this "Land of Abundance," but the actual living conditions we saw were even better than what we had heard and better than what we had originally imagined.
    When we first arrived at Xipu Township, the location of the Red Light People's Commune Management Committee, everything we saw left us somewhat bewildered, as if we had entered a city. I dare say that Xipu Township is in no way inferior to an average county town in the North. The streets are lined with shops, including suppliers of agricultural tools and other means of production, department stores with a wide variety of goods, stationery stores and bookstores, and a range of service industries from dining and tea drinking to bathing and hairdressing. There are also agricultural machinery factories, wild fiber factories, brewing factories for wine and condiments, factories for manufacturing pastries and other non-staple foods, and so on. All the shops are bustling with customers. At night, the electric lights are bright, making it even more lively than during the day. People are bustling about; those who have been working in the fields and factories all day come to the streets, some to bathe, some to get a haircut, and many more to sit in teahouses and drink tea. Wired broadcasting begins, with news, songs, and current issues concerning agricultural production, followed by beautiful Sichuan opera. Sipping covered-bowl tea, listening to news of important national events, and enjoying the moving "Autumn River" and "Tale of Tan Ji'er" dissipate the fatigue of the day, preparing them for the next day's labor. Of course, this was only our first impression upon arriving at the Red Light Commune, and all of this is only an outward phenomenon. When we settled down and learned more about the situation, we gained a deeper understanding of the more genuine aspects of people's lives.

      Changes in Social Purchasing Power
    Social purchasing power is an important measure of the people's living standards. There are five commercial centers like Xipu throughout the Red Light Commune. Although they vary in size, all kinds of industries are available to meet the needs of farmers. From January to the end of June this year, the total turnover of the Red Light Commune's commercial departments was more than 1.67 million yuan, an increase of more than 43% over the same period last year. Among them, the sales of daily necessities and the turnover of service industries such as restaurants and teahouses increased by more than 168% over the same period last year. Among daily necessities, the largest sales volume was for cloth, totaling more than 164,000 meters, an increase of 128% over the same period last year. This was followed by knitwear, cultural supplies, towels, soap, and so on. It is worth noting that the sales volume of certain high-end commodities that have traditionally been less popular in rural areas, such as sweaters,绒衣, cotton interlock shirts and pants, bamboo shell thermos flasks, rubber shoes, and gold pens, has greatly increased, with绒衣and rubber shoes increasing by four to five times. Social purchasing power is a very important measure of the people's living standards, but it is not the only measure, let alone the most accurate one. In some countries, such as the United States, although its social purchasing power may appear high, there are large numbers of people who are poorly clothed and fed. Therefore, we should also look at the distribution of social purchasing power and the conditions and changes in the lives of the families with the lowest purchasing power. To measure people's living standards, we must look at the highest level of living, the social average, and, more importantly, the families with the lowest level of living.

  No More
  "Overdraft Households"
    "We have completely eliminated overdraft households." When discussing the changes in people's lives since the establishment of the commune or the superiority of the commune with cadres or commune members, people always say this with a hint of pride.
  "Overdraft households" were a segment of farming households in the agricultural cooperative era who, due to having fewer laborers, weddings and funerals, illness, or other irresistible reasons, could not make enough to live on their labor remuneration. Thus, the agricultural cooperative would advance them a portion of grain and cash, which would then be deducted from their labor remuneration in the following year. Except for a small number of families whose status changed to "balanced households" or those with slight surpluses due to the increased production level of the agricultural cooperative, most continued to overdraw, because it was impossible for the agricultural cooperative to raise the production level very high in a single year, and it was also impossible for the overdraft households themselves to completely change the fundamental reasons for the overdraft, such as having a large population and few laborers, in a single year. Therefore, some overdraft households gradually became "old overdraft households." Before the establishment of the commune, all sixty-seven agricultural cooperatives that formed the Red Light People's Commune had overdraft households or "old overdraft households." Among the commune's more than 16,000 households of members, approximately 10%, or more than 1,600 households, were overdraft households. The Twelfth Management District, originally the Red Light Agricultural Cooperative, was the earliest to implement the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the Red Light Commune. It started with mutual aid teams in 1952 and established an agricultural cooperative in 1954, with rapid production development. The average yield per unit area of grain increased from 561 jin per mu in 1954 to 585 jin in 1955, 628 jin in 1956, 767 jin in 1957, and 1,217.5 jin in 1958. Income from sideline occupations also increased from 699 yuan in 1954 to 100,1565 yuan in 1958. The total output value of agricultural and sideline products increased more than twofold, equivalent to three times that of 1954. However, before the transition to the commune, among the 949 households of members, there were still 50 to 60 households that were overdraft households.
    "No more overdraft households," this is the most important symbol of the overall improvement in the lives of all farmers since the establishment of the people's commune. It contains extremely profound significance and extremely rich content. The fact that overdraft households have been eliminated and will never be created again shows that China's farmers have firmly embarked on the path of common prosperity and universal improvement. This vivid and profound fact is due to the superiority of the people's commune system—the high-speed development of production and the advanced distribution system. Because of the comprehensive and high-speed development of the rural economy since the establishment of the commune, it has become possible for us to implement an advanced distribution system that combines the wage system and the supply system. Thus, as stated in the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session, all farmers in the country have obtained the most important and reliable social insurance. All the elderly, children, and people without the ability to work are supported by the commune, which eliminates the most important cause of overdrafts: the phenomenon of having a large population and few laborers. The Red Light People's Commune has more than 200 elderly and disabled people without support or labor capacity, who are now living happily and carefree in three homes for the elderly; nearly 10,000 young children are growing up freely and happily in nearly 500 nurseries and kindergartens; and more elderly people who have not entered the homes for the elderly are also supported by the commune according to the same supply standards. Other factors, such as the development of medical and health services, the establishment of a subsidy system for workers after illness, are important factors in the absence and creation of overdraft households, and are important indicators of the overall improvement and improvement of people's lives.

      An Ordinary Family
    Changes in the personal income of commune members are another important measure of people's living conditions, even the most accurate and basic measure. After the establishment of the commune, has people's income increased or decreased compared to before? We don't need to look for the strongest and most skilled adult male commune members, because they undoubtedly have the highest income in the commune under the principle of distribution according to work; it would be better to find ordinary people, or even those with weaker labor and poorer skills, to illustrate the essence of the issue. Zhang Anlin is a middle-aged woman who has always participated in field labor, and there have been no fundamental changes before and after the establishment of the commune. Her income situation is as follows: In 1957, her family's sideline occupations (raising pigs) were the best, so this year was the year her family earned the most before the establishment of the commune, receiving a total of 4,000 jin of grain and 50 yuan in cash from the agricultural cooperative; the income from sideline occupations was 110 yuan. Grain was distributed according to the family population with reference to labor work points. At that time, her family had seven people: a couple, four children, and an elderly person. The average was about 570 jin per person. Now, after the establishment of the commune, public canteens have been set up and a food supply system has been implemented. The grain supply standard is 1.5 jin per person per day, with an average of 540 jin per person per year. This seems to be a little less than her family's average in 1957, but first, this year, in addition to implementing the food supply system, the commune also issued 100 jin of grain to each family as household reserve grain; second, the grain at that time included both human and animal consumption. If you deduct the feed (like the current commune), the actual per capita ration was far from 570 jin, but 500, 450, or even less. Therefore, we can ignore the grain issue and only look at cash income. In 1957, her family received a total of 160 yuan in cash. After the establishment of the commune, from November of last year to the end of May of this year, she received more than 30 yuan in wages and more than 50 yuan in income from sideline occupations, totaling nearly 90 yuan. 160 yuan in one year in 1957, and 90 yuan in half a year now, which seems to be not much of an increase, only about 10 yuan more in half a year. However, if you carefully analyze the use of this money and analyze the various items of family expenses, you will find a big difference. At that time, more than half of Zhang Anlin's family's money was used for food, including oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar. Now this expense is gone, as the public canteen covers everything. The food standard here is about 4 yuan per month, but because the vegetables are grown by themselves and the firewood is gathered by themselves, they don't cost any money or very little. If calculated at market prices, it is about 8 yuan per month, which is much higher than the level of the wealthy middle peasants in this area before. This means that the food level of everyone in the Red Light Commune has exceeded that of wealthy middle peasants. If Zhang Anlin's family's meals in 1957 were to be at the level of the current public canteen, she said, "It would be impossible even if all the money was used for food." Second, another part of the money was used for supporting the elderly and raising children. This expense for Zhang Anlin's family accounted for about 40% of the total cash income. Zhang Anlin clapped her hands and said with a smile, "There wasn't much left for ourselves." Therefore, Zhang Anlin's family hasn't bought many new clothes in recent years. Although the supply standard for cotton cloth was lower than it is now, there was still a surplus every year—not because there were too many cloth coupons that couldn't be used, but because there was not enough money to buy them. After the establishment of the commune, the expenses for supporting the elderly and raising children have also been greatly reduced. Zhang Anlin had already bought all the cloth with the cloth coupons for the first half of this year, and everyone sewed new clothes. When we saw her on the threshing floor, she, like other young women, was all in new clothes, a navy blue fine cloth jacket and dark blue fine cloth pants. "One yuan now is worth three yuan in the past," she said, "Eating doesn't cost money, and children in nurseries don't cost money; only clothing and pocket money require it." Then she added, "I don't smoke or drink, so there's nowhere else to spend the money."
    From the perspective of social purchasing power, from the perspective that there are no more overdraft households and every household has income, and from the perspective of the increase in the personal income of commune members and the use of expenses, it all proves eloquently that since the establishment of the commune, people's living standards have greatly improved, and they have improved universally. However, all of this is only in terms of material life. Although material life occupies a premise important position in people's entire life, when comprehensively examining people's living standards, it should not be limited to material life, but should also include cultural life. Moreover, with the improvement and improvement of material life, the position of cultural life in people's entire life is becoming more and more important, and people's requirements for cultural life are becoming higher and higher and more and more urgent.

    Rich and Varied Cultural Life
    The cultural life of the Red Light People's Commune, with the development of production, has also moved forward by leaps and bounds. Children receive systematic school education, while adults lead a rich and varied cultural life.
    Before the establishment of the commune, there was only one normal school for training primary school teachers and twenty-nine primary schools. After the establishment of the commune, not only have these existing schools been greatly expanded and the number of students has greatly increased, but also many regular and amateur schools of various kinds have been established by the commune itself. After the establishment of the commune, it directly established a regular ordinary middle school and five half-day agricultural middle schools, thirty-three regular primary schools and twenty-six red-and-expert schools of an amateur nature. Now the Red Light People's Commune has a total of 95 schools of various types. Except for the Red-and-Expert schools, there are a total of approximately 13,000 students and more than 400 teachers. More than 82% of children aged seven to fifteen have already enrolled in school (primary school has been universalized, and all school-age children have already enrolled). We visited an agricultural middle school and a primary school. In these schools, two very distinct characteristics can be seen: education serves politics, and learning is combined with production. Secondary schools all have political courses, systematically learning about current events and the party's policies. The political course in the previous period used the Sixth Plenary Session's "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" as teaching material. Agricultural middle schools are half-day, with half a day for learning and half a day for labor. During the busy agricultural season, classes are suspended for a busy break. When we went to visit the agricultural middle school in the Twelfth Management District, they had only been in school for a few days—they had a busy break for nearly two months during the summer harvest and summer planting. The teachers were stepping up their teaching, wanting to complete the courses for this academic year according to the teaching plan set by the commune before the big autumn busy break. Students at all levels have a certain amount of labor time. Students in the third and fourth grades of primary school and above have two sessions per week, two hours each time. Ordinary middle schools and normal schools have two sessions per week, three hours each time. During the busy agricultural season, classes are suspended for a short period to participate in production. Although the students in the agricultural middle school are all teenagers aged twelve to fifteen, they are really capable when it comes to labor. They not only have a lot of new agricultural knowledge, but also have more enthusiasm. During the summer harvest and summer planting, the students in the agricultural middle school in the Twelfth Management District also participated in the high-efficiency movement, competing with the adults, and a dozen students (this middle school has a total of 53 students) also received high-efficiency extra bonuses. The commune members were very happy to see these students, saying that they were "knowledgeable about the world, understand politics, and are new farmers who are capable of both writing and martial arts."
    Comparable to school education is the development of medical and health services. In the past, it was known to everyone how difficult it was for farmers to find a doctor and get medicine when they got sick. Now the situation is very different. Not only have clinics been set up in each production team, so that team members can receive treatment nearby for headaches, fever, colds, and coughs without leaving the village, but the commune has also planned to establish five hospitals, five health clinics, and nine maternity hospitals in each management district, so that people can get treatment at the hospital without having to travel far for more serious illnesses. Now the Red Light Commune has a total of 66 doctors of traditional Chinese medicine, 14 doctors of Western medicine, 56 nurses, and 5 midwives, in addition to 47 midwives who do not leave production and 84 health workers. The five hospitals have a total of 27 beds, and the maternity hospitals have 15 beds. On average, there is one doctor for every 1,000 people in the commune, one bed for every 2,500 people, and one professional and non-separated medical and health worker for every 300 people. These medical and health departments were all established after the establishment of the commune. Commune members only pay the cost of medicine when they see a doctor, and only pay according to the food supply standard when they are hospitalized, which is convenient for everyone.
    The commune members' regular cultural life is even more interesting, educational, and colorful. The whole commune has four cultural centers, with newspapers, pictorials, and books suitable for farmers to read. During leisure time after work and on holidays, commune members can freely read in them. In addition, there are three broadcasting stations and 450 loudspeakers. The broadcasting stations broadcast three times in the morning, noon, and evening, and each management district and production team can receive the broadcasts. The commune members like to listen to the broadcasts most, in which they can learn about important national events, hear inspiring news of abundant harvests, and moving music and operas. In the countryside, who could see movies in the past? Now, the Red Light Commune actually has two film projection teams. The film projection teams take turns showing movies in each management district and production team. Each commune member can see two movies a month. Each production team also has amateur theater troupes and singing groups, and their performances can be seen every holiday or when any commune member congress is held.
    This is the situation of the material and cultural lives of the commune members of the Red Light People's Commune that we have learned about. From the actual living conditions of the people, we can clearly see the outline of the changes in people's lives before and after the establishment of the Red Light Commune.

    上升
    ——红光公社见闻杂记之二
    田流
    真是百闻不如一见，没有到四川省以前，对这“天府之国”的人民的富裕生活就早有所闻，但是我们看到的人民生活的实际情形，比以前听到的还要好，比我们自己原来设想的也好得多。
    我们刚到红光人民公社管理委员会所在地犀浦乡的时候，看到的一切简直使我们有些迷惘，还以为是走进了一个城市。我敢说，犀浦乡同北方一般的县城比起来毫无逊色。街上商店林立，有农具等生产资料供应商店，有货物较全的百货商店，有文具店和书店，有从吃饭、喝茶到洗澡、理发的一系列的服务性行业；还有农具机械工厂、野生纤维工厂、酒和调味品的酿造工厂、糕点等副食品制造工厂等等。各个商店里都是顾客盈门、高朋满座。入夜，电灯辉煌，更比白天热闹三分，人们熙熙攘攘，在田间在工厂劳动了一天的人们这时到街上来了，有的去洗澡，有的去理发，有更多的人坐在茶馆里喝茶。有线广播开始播音了，新闻、歌曲、农业生产当前应注意的问题，而后是优美动听的四川戏。喝着盖碗茶，听听国家大事的新闻，欣赏着动人的“秋江”、“谭记儿”，一天的疲劳消失了，为第二天劳动又准备好力量。——当然，这只是刚到红光公社时的第一个印象，这一切也只是一个外表的现象。当我们住下来，对情况了解得多了一点的时候，才更深刻地认识到人民生活的更为真实的面貌。
      社会购买力的变化
    社会购买力是衡量人民生活水平的一个重要的标尺。像犀浦这样的商业繁盛的居民点全红光公社共有五处。虽然规模各有不同，但各种行业也都应有尽有，很适合农民生活需要。今年1月份到6月底，红光公社各商业部门的营业总额是一百六十七万多元，比去年同期增长了43％以上。其中生活日用百货的销售额和服务性的饭馆、茶馆等行业的营业额比去年同时增长了168％以上。在日用百货中销售量最大的是布匹，计十六万四千多公尺，比去年同期增长128％。其次是针织品、文化用品和毛巾、香皂等等。值得注意的是向来农村销售量较少的某些高挡商品如毛衣、绒衣、棉毛衫裤、竹壳保温水瓶、胶鞋、金笔等等，销售量大大增加了，如绒衣、胶鞋增加四倍到五倍以上。社会购买力是衡量人民生活水平的一个很重要的尺度，但并不是唯一的尺度，更不是最准确的尺度。在有些国家里，譬如在美国，它的社会购买力尽管看起来很高，但却有大量大量的衣不遮体、食不果腹的人群。因此，我们还应该看看社会购买力的分布状况，看看购买力最低的人家的状况和变化。衡量人民的生活水平要看那生活最高的，也要看社会平均数，更要看生活最低的人家。
  再也没有
  “超支户”了
    “我们已经完全消灭了超支户”。同干部或社员谈起公社化以后人民生活变化或公社优越性的时候，人们总是略带炫耀地这样说。
  “超支户”是农业社时代一部分农户由于家里劳动力少、由于婚丧嫁娶、由于生病或其他的不可抗拒的原因，凭自己的劳动报酬不够生活，于是农业社就多支给他一部分粮食、现金，第二年再从他的劳动报酬中扣除的人家。这种超支户除少部分人家因农业社生产水平提高变为“平衡户”或稍有节余以外，大部分仍然继续超支，原因是农业社不可能在一年之内把生产水平提得很高，超支户自己也不可能在一年之内把造成超支的根本原因——如人口多劳力少等等彻底改变。所以有些超支户慢慢地又变成了“老超支户”。公社化以前，组成红光人民公社的六十七个农业社里，社社都有超支户或者“老超支户”。全公社一万六千多户社员中大约有10％即一千六百多户是超支户。十二管理区是红光公社开展互助合作运动最早的原红光农业社，从1952年就搞互助组，1954年就成立起农业社，而且生产也发展的很快。粮食的平均单位面积产量，从1954年的每亩五百六十一斤，发展到1955年的五百八十五斤，1956年的六百二十八斤，1957年的七百六十七斤，1958年的一千二百一十七斤半。副业收入也由1954年的六百九十九元发展到1958年的十万零一千五百六十五元。农副业的总产值增长了两倍多，相当于1954年的三倍。但是在转入公社以前，在九百四十九户社员总户数中，仍有五、六十户社员是超支户。
    “再也没了超支户”，这是人民公社化以后，全体农民生活普遍提高的一个最重要的标志。它包涵着极其深刻的意义和极为丰富的内容。消灭了超支户而且再也不会产生超支户这个事实说明：我国农民已经稳固地走上了共同富裕、普遍提高的道路。这个生动深刻的事实是由于人民公社制度的优越性——生产的高速度发展和先进的分配制度而产生的。由于公社化以后农村经济的全面的高速度的发展，使我们有可能实行先进的工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度。这样，正如六中全会决议中所说的，全国农民就得到了最重要最可靠的社会保险。一切老人、小孩和没有劳动能力的人，都由公社负责供养，这就把造成超支的一个最主要的原因：人口多劳力少的现象消除了。红光人民公社共有二百多个无有依靠丧失劳动力的老年人、残废者，现在都在三所敬老院里无忧无虑地安度着他们的晚年；有近万个幼儿在近五百所托儿所、幼儿园里，自由自在地幸福的成长；那些没有入敬老院的更多的老人，也由公社按同样的供给标准供养着。其他如医疗卫生事业的发展，劳动者生病后的补助制度的建立等等，都是不再存在和产生超支户的重要因素，都是人民生活普遍改善和提高的重要标志。
      一个普通的家庭
    社员个人收入情况的变化，是衡量人民生活状况的又一个重要尺度，甚至是最准确最基本的尺度。公社化以后，人们的收入比以前是增多了呢，还是减少了？我们不必找那劳动力最强、技术最高的壮年男社员，因为他们在按劳分配的原则下，无疑是全社收入最多的；只找那最能够说明问题本质的一般的、甚至劳动力较弱和技术较差的人，来作例证会更好些。张安林是一个壮年妇女，一贯参加田间劳动，公社化前后没有什么本质的变化。她的收入的情况是这样：1957年她的家庭副业搞得最好
  （养猪），因此，这一年是她家在公社化以前，收入最多的一年，共从农业社分得粮食四千斤，现金五十元；家庭副业收入一百一十元。粮食是按家庭人口参照劳动工分分配的，当时她家七口人：夫妇两个，四个孩子，一个老人。平均每人五百七十斤的样子。现在，公社化后举办了公共食堂，实行了伙食供给制，粮食供应标准是每人每天一斤半，平均每人全年五百四十斤。看起来比她家1957年的平均数少一些，但是第一，今年公社除实行伙食供给制外，每家还发了一百斤粮食作为家庭储备粮；第二，那时的粮食人吃马喂都在内，如果除去饲料（像现在公社这样），实际上每人平均的口粮远不是五百七十斤，而是五百、四百五甚至更少。所以，粮食问题我们可以不去管它，只看现金收入。1957年她家共收入一百六十元现金，公社化以后，从去年的11月到今年的5月底，共领得工资三十多元，家庭副业收入五十多元，两项合计将近九十元。1957年一年一百六十元，现在半年九十元，看起来数量增加不多，半年才增加了十元左右。但是，如果仔细分析一下这些钱的用途，分析一下家庭开支的各种项目，就会发现其中大有不同了。那时张安林家有一半以上的钱用在伙食上，油、盐、酱、醋都由它开支。现在这笔开支没有了，公共食堂全包了。这里的伙食标准是每月四元左右，但因为菜是自己种的，柴是自己打的，都不算钱或者算得很少，如果按市场价格计算，每月八元左右，水平大大超过了原先这一带富裕中农的水平，这就是说红光公社每一个人的伙食水平都已经超过富裕中农了。如果张安林家在1957年的饭食要像现在公共食堂这样的水平，她说，“把钱都用到伙食上也办不到”。第二，另一部分钱用在养老育幼上面，张安林家这笔开支约占现金总收入40％左右，张安林两手一拍，微笑着说：“用在自己身上的就没有几个了”。所以，几年来张安林全家漆置的新衣裳不多，那时棉布的供应标准虽然比现在少，可是仍然年年有剩余——不是布票太多用不了，而是钱少不能买啊。公社化后，抚老育幼的这笔开支也大大减少了，今年上半年度的布票张安林早已把它统统买回布来，人人都缝了新衣。我们在打麦场上看到她的时候，她和别的年青妇女一样，浑身上下一色新，海昌蓝细布褂子，藏青的细布裤子。“现在的一个钱顶过去三个钱用，”她说，“吃饭不要钱，孩子在托儿所不要钱；只是穿衣、零用才用得着它。”随后又补充说：“我又不吸烟，不喝酒，钱更没处花了。”
    从社会购买力方面看，从再也没有超支户、家家户户都有收入方面看，从社员个人收入增加以及开支用途方面看，都雄辩地证明：公社化以后，人们的生活水平是大大地提高了，而且是普遍地提高了。但是这一切只是物质生活方面的，虽然物质生活在人们的全部生活中占据着前提的重要地位，但在全面地考察人民的生活水平的时候，就不能仅只限于物质生活方面，也应该包括文化生活方面。而且随着物质生活的改善和提高，文化生活在人们的全部生活中所占的位置是越来越重要了，人们对文化生活的要求是越来越高，越来越迫切了。
    丰富多采的文化生活
    红光人民公社的文化生活，随着生产的发展，也大踏步地前进了。少年儿童受着系统的学校教育，而成年人又过着丰富多彩的文化生活。
    公社化以前，这里只有一所培养小学教师的师范学校和二十九个小学。公社化以后，不仅原有的这些学校有了很大的扩大，学生人数有了极大的增加，而且出现了很多的公社自己举办的正规的和业余的各种学校。公社建立后，直接兴办了一所正规的普通中学和五所半日制的农业中学，三十三所正规小学和二十六所业余性质的红专学校。现在红光人民公社共有各种学校九十五所，除红专学校以外，共有学生一万三千人左右，教师四百多名，从七岁到十五岁的少年儿童，已经有82％以上入学（小学已经普及，学龄儿童已经全部入学了）。我们访问了一所农业中学和一个小学。在这些学校里可以看出有两个十分鲜明的特点：教育为政治服务，学习与生产结合。中等学校都设有政治课程，系统地学习时事和党的政策，前一个时期的政治课就是以六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”作教材的。农业中学是半日制，半天学习、半天劳动，农忙时还停课放忙假。我们去访问十二管理区的农业中学时，他们开学不几天——夏收夏种时放了近两个月的忙假，老师们正在加紧授课，想在放大秋忙假以前，把这一学年的功课按公社规定的教学计划授完。各级学校的学生都有一定的劳动时间，小学的三、四年级以上的学生是每周二次，每次二小时，普通中学和师范是每周二次每次三小时，农忙时短期停课参加生产。农业中学的学生虽然都是十二岁到十五岁的少年，劳动起来还是真有两手，不仅有很多新的农业知识，而且干劲更大。十二管理区农业中学的学生在夏收夏种中，还参加了高工效运动，和大人们比着干，有十几个学生（这个中学共五十三个学生）还得了高工效超额奖励。社员们看了这些学生都很高兴，说他们是“世事通达懂政治，能文能武新农民。”
    同学校教育相媲美的是医疗卫生事业的发展。过去，农民生了病想找个医生看看、吃付药，那个困难劲儿是人人都了解的。现在情况大不相同了，不仅各个生产队都设立了诊疗室，队员们有个头疼脑热、伤风咳嗽，不用出村就可以就近治疗了；而且公社还在各个管理区有计划地设立了五个医院，五个保健室，九个妇产院，有较严重的病，也不用跑多远的路就可到医院得到治疗了。现在红光公社共有六十六名中医、十四名西医，五十六名护理人员和五名助产员，另外还有四十七名不脱离生产的助产人员和八十四名保健人员。五所医院共有二十七个床位，妇产院有十五个床位。全公社平均一千人有一个医生，二千五百人有一个床位，三百人有一个专业的和不脱离生产的医疗卫生工作人员。这些医疗保健部门都是公社化以后才建立起来的，社员看病只收医药成本费，住院只按伙食供给标准收费，所以人人称便。
    社员们经常的文化生活更是饶有兴趣，富有教育意义和丰富多彩的。全公社有四个文化馆，里面的报纸画报和适宜农民阅读的书籍。劳动余暇、假日，社员们可以自由自在地在里面阅览。另外，还有三个广播站，四百五十个喇叭。广播站早、午、晚广播三次，各个管理区、生产队都能收听。社员们最喜欢听广播了，在广播中既能知道国家大事，也能听到鼓舞人心的丰产消息和动人的音乐戏曲。在农村，过去谁能看到电影呢？现在，红光公社竟有两个电影放映队了。电影队轮流到各个管理区、生产队放映。每个社员每月能看到两次电影。各个生产队还有业余的剧团和歌咏队，每逢假日或开什么社员大会的时候都能看到他们的演出。
    这就是我们了解的红光人民公社社员们的物质生活和文化生活的情形。从人们的实际生活状况中，我们可以清晰地看出红光公社成立前后人民生活变化的轮廓。
