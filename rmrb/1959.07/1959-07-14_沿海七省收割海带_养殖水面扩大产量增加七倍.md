Coastal Seven Provinces Harvest Kelp
Cultivation Area Expanded, Output Increased Sevenfold

(Our Dispatch) The coastal areas, with over 80,000 mu of kelp cultivation, are in the midst of a tense harvest. Large-scale, high-yield areas are continuously emerging. The Da Li Commune in Penglai County, Shandong Province, cultivated 124 mu of water surface, achieving an average yield of 2,125 jin of dried kelp per mu; Rongcheng County has 2,550 mu of water surface, with an average yield of 1,830 jin per mu. The Seventh Brigade of the Huangqi Commune in Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, has over 100 mu, averaging 1,667 jin per mu. Dalian City expects its output to increase more than fivefold compared to last year. The national total output will increase more than sevenfold compared to last year.

In 1958, the coastal kelp cultivation area totaled 8,800 mu; this year, it has expanded to over 80,000 mu. In order to carry out large-scale kelp cultivation, the seven coastal provinces jointly organized a major kelp seedling cultivation collaboration in the Lüda area last autumn. After half a year of hard work, they successfully cultivated over 3.8 billion seedlings. This spring, during the kelp seedling separation, many people's communes in the coastal areas seized the characteristics of the seedling separation being "heavy task, short time," implemented the principle of the secretary taking command, cadres participating in production, organized the masses to attack the seedling separation barrier, and launched a "full attendance, high yield, high quality" red flag competition. In general areas, the average number of seedlings separated per person increased from several hundred at the beginning to 5,000 to 7,000. This was followed by offshore cultivation work focusing on complete and strong seedlings. Various regions have generally formulated management methods of assigning specific areas to specific people, replenishing seedlings in a timely manner, reducing the late seedling rate, adjusting the water layer in time to allow the kelp seedlings to receive reasonable light, and removing miscellaneous algae to prevent enemies. In particular, in the northern regions of Liaoning and Shandong, where the nitrogen content of seawater is low and chemical fertilizers are insufficient, human excrement and urine, and soil fertilizer are applied in a timely manner to promote kelp growth and ensure a bumper harvest.

    沿海七省收割海带
    养殖水面扩大产量增加七倍
    本报讯　沿海八万多亩养殖水面，正在紧张收割海带。大面积高产陆续出现。山东蓬莱县大李公社养殖的一百二十四亩水面，平均亩产海带二千一百二十五斤（晒干的，下同）；荣城县有二千五百五十亩水面，平均亩产一千八百三十斤。福建连江县黄岐公社第七大队有一百多亩，平均亩产一千六百六十七斤。旅大市预计产量将较去年增加五倍多。全国总产量将比去年增加七倍多。
    沿海养殖海带水面，1958年共八千八百亩，今年扩大到八万多亩。沿海七省为开展大面积海带养殖，去秋共同在旅大地区组织了海带育苗大协作，经过半年苦战，成功地培育了幼苗三十八亿多株。今年春季海带分苗的时候，沿海许多人民公社抓住了分苗“任务重，时间短”的特点，实行书记挂帅，干部参加生产，组织群众猛攻分苗关，开展“满勤、高产、高质”红旗竞赛。一般地区由开始分苗平均每人几百株，提高到五千到七千株。接着进入以苗全、苗壮为中心的海上养育工作。各地较普遍地制定了分片包干专人负责的管理办法，按时补苗，降低晚苗率；及时调整水层，使海带苗合理受光；清除杂藻，防止敌害。特别是北方辽宁、山东海水含氮量低，化肥不足，便适时施用人粪尿、土化肥，促进了海带生长，保证了大丰收。
