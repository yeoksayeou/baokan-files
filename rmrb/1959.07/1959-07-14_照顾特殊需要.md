　　Caring for Special Needs
　　In areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities and areas with mixed ethnic populations, the demands of the masses for commodities are often diverse: here, there are both common requirements and special needs. This situation requires commercial departments to make every effort to meet general needs while also meeting special needs as much as possible according to the characteristics of each ethnic group.
　　Our country is a multi-ethnic nation, and each fraternal ethnic group has its own living habits. Take commodities like tea, saddles, and hunting guns as examples. In Han areas, they may not be necessities for people's production and life, but in fraternal ethnic areas, they are indispensable for people's production and life. In terms of clothing, each fraternal ethnic group also has its unique ethnic style. For example, jewelry and jade, and gold and silver ornaments are rarely used in Han areas, but they occupy an important position in the lives of fraternal ethnic groups. Commercial departments doing everything possible to meet their needs for these special commodities not only adds color to the lives of ethnic minorities, but also greatly helps in studying and promoting the excellent cultural and artistic heritage of our various ethnic groups and promoting cultural exchanges between ethnic groups.
　　Commercial work in ethnic minority areas has the task of promoting the continuous development of the economy and culture of ethnic minorities. It is hoped that the commercial departments in ethnic minority areas will take on this task well.

### 照顾特殊需要

    照顾特殊需要
    在少数民族聚居的地区和多种民族杂居的地区，群众对商品的需求常常是多种多样的：这里，既有共同的要求，又有特殊的需要，这种情况要求商业部门既要尽一切力量满足一般的需要，又要按照各民族特点尽可能满足特殊的需要。
    我国是个多民族的国家，各个兄弟民族都有他们自己的生活习惯。就拿茶叶、马具、猎枪这样的商品来说，在汉族地区不一定是人民生产生活上必需的，但在兄弟民族地区却是人民生产生活上必不可少的东西。在穿着方面，各兄弟民族也有他们独特的民族风格，例如珠宝玉器、金银饰品，汉族地区很少采用，而在兄弟民族的人民生活中却占有重要地位。商业部门尽一切可能满足他们对这些特殊商品的需要，不仅为少数民族的生活增添色彩，而且对研究和发扬我国各民族优秀的文化艺术遗产，促进各民族间的文化交流也是很有帮助的。
    少数民族地区的商业工作，负有推动少数民族经济文化不断发展的任务。希望少数民族居住地区的商业部门把这项任务很好地担当起来。
