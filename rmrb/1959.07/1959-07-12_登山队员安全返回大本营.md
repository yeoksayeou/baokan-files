Xinhua News Agency, Muztagh Ata, July 11th. The thirty-three male and female athletes from our country who reached the summit of "The Father of Ice Mountains," Muztagh Ata, safely returned to the base camp on the 7th, 8th, and 9th, respectively.

    Because the mountaineering team was large, the personnel who reached the summit did so at different times. The thirty-three male and female athletes descended the mountain in several batches. The first to return to the base camp were mountaineers Mu Bingsuo and Tibetan athlete Laba Cairin. After reaching the summit on the 7th, they rushed back to the base camp in just over five hours to report the good news. Shi Zhanchun, director of the Mountaineering Department of the National Sports Commission, and most of the female mountaineers rested overnight at an altitude of 7,200 meters before returning to the base camp the next day. Xu Jing, the captain of the mountaineering team, deputy captains Shi Jing and Yan Dongliang, master sportsman Chen Rongchang, and other team members were the last to return to the camp. Along the way, they cleaned up the various high-altitude camps, transporting the heavy equipment and remaining food back.

    During the ascent to the summit, the scientific workers in the mountaineering team also carried out observations of the geomorphology of the Muztagh Ata area, as well as scientific investigation work such as the observation of meteorological elements and radiation intensity at different altitudes. A color documentary film of the mountaineering expedition was also successfully filmed during the climb.

    登山队员安全返回大本营
    据新华社慕士塔格山11日电　我国登上“冰山之父”慕士塔格山顶峰的三十三名男、女运动员，已分别于7日、8日和9日全部安全地返回了大本营基地。
    由于这次登山队伍庞大，登上顶峰的人员前后时间不一。三十三名男、女运动员，分好几批陆续下山。第一批返回大本营的是登山运动员穆炳锁和藏族运动员拉巴才仁二人，他们在7日登上顶峰后，以五个多小时就赶回大本营报告喜讯。国家体委登山处处长史占春和大部分女子登山运动员在拔海七千二百米处休息一夜后，第二天返回了大本营。登山队队长许竞、副队长石竞、阎栋梁、运动健将陈荣昌和其他队员是最后返回营地的，沿途他们清理了高山各个营地，把那些沉重的装备和余下的食品运了回来。
    在攀登顶峰的过程中，登山队中的科学工作者还进行了慕士塔格山区地貌的观察，以及在不同高度的气象要素观察和辐射强度的观察等科学考察工作。一部登山彩色纪录片，也在登山过程中拍摄成功。
