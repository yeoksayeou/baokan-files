Editor's Note

    "Secretary Yang"

    "Secretary Yang's" surname isn't Yang, it's Zhang. Because he wholeheartedly seeks welfare for the people in the mountainous areas, is determined to turn the impoverished mountainous area into a rich one, goes deep into the masses, shares weal and woe, develops animal husbandry, and strengthens the flocks of sheep in this mountainous area. Therefore, the masses of people and grassroots cadres in the mountainous area call him "Secretary Yang."
      "Secretary Yang" is now considering two of the most important issues: one is to continue to take measures to breed livestock faster; the other is to cultivate fine breeds of sheep, provide the country with more wool, mutton, and hides, and support the whole country with more and better breeds of sheep. This shows that Comrade Zhang Chuyuan is always concerned about the masses of people and always concerned about the motherland, demonstrating the excellent ideological qualities of a good cadre. We wish Comrade Zhang Chuyuan's ideals can be realized, we wish the Wuzhai mountainous area can be filled with sheep everywhere, developing and prospering; we wish our motherland can obtain more and better sheep.

    “羊书记”
    “羊书记”不姓羊，是姓张。因为他尽心尽力为山区人民谋取福利，决心要把贫困的山区变成富饶的山区，深入群众，同甘共苦，发展畜牧业，壮大了这个山区的羊群。所以，山区的人民群众和基层干部都称他是“羊书记”。
      “羊书记”现在正在考虑两个最重要的问题，一个是继续采取措施，更快地繁殖牲畜；一个是培养优良的羊种，多供给国家羊毛、羊肉和皮张，用更多更好的羊种支援全国。这说明了张初元同志时时关心人民群众，时时关心祖国，表现了一个好干部的优良的思想品质。祝张初元同志的理想能够实现，祝五寨山区能够处处满布羊群，发展繁荣；祝我们祖国能够得到更多更好的羊只。
