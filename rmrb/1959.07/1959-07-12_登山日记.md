    Mountaineering Diary

      Team Meeting
    June 27th.
    As soon as the large team descended the mountain, the team headquarters immediately convened a meeting. In the team headquarters' "Mongolian yurt," team leader Xu Jing, instructor Wang Fengtong, deputy leaders Yuan Yang (female), Shi Jing, and Yan Dongliang, and other team leaders were all sitting around on the felt. Initially, the report covered the team members' high-altitude acclimatization and physical exertion during the second march training. Everyone agreed that the high-altitude acclimatization this time was a great improvement compared to the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team's ascent of Muztagh Ata three years ago, and compared to all the mountaineering activities they had experienced. Even the female team members' altitude sickness was much better than many male team members' when climbing Muztagh Ata three years ago. Not one of the forty-plus male and female mountaineers collapsed. The general reaction at high altitudes was only a slight headache. This was naturally due to the team members' arduous training in recent years, and especially because the altitude of the base camp was nearly five hundred meters higher than three years ago, which from the beginning allowed the team members to develop better high-altitude acclimatization.
    Xu Jing, the leader of the mountaineering team, summarized the above situation, saying, "Every time we undergo training, we will achieve better high-altitude acclimatization. Now the team members' acclimatization is very good, but their physical strength has relatively decreased. Our original plan was to conduct a third march training before attempting the main peak on the fourth advance. In between, although the team members' high-altitude acclimatization improved, their physical strength decreased again. This is a contradiction."
    Shi Zhanchun, director of the Mountaineering Department of the National Sports Commission, who had been half-lying down as if lost in thought, suddenly sat up. He said happily, "Can we cancel the third march training and climb the main peak next time?" After he brought this up, the topic of discussion immediately shifted to whether or not to have a third march. The yurt immediately became lively with everyone talking at once.
    If the third march is cancelled, the next march will be one thousand three hundred and forty-six meters higher than six thousand two hundred meters. How will the team members acclimatize to the high altitude? Xu Jing, the leader of the mountaineering team, cited the example of climbing Mount Gongga's main peak, where the height of the last march training was more than one thousand three hundred and ninety meters from the main peak, and this time it was only one thousand three hundred and forty-six meters, so it was completely safe to reach the summit.
    In this way, the discussion became more and more in-depth. Finally, everyone analyzed the favorable conditions and difficult factors for climbing the main peak this time. It was decided to submit this important issue to all the mountaineering team members for discussion tomorrow.
      New Decision
    June 28th.
    At 10:00 a.m., Shi Zhanchun, director of the Mountaineering Department of the National Sports Commission, proposed to all team members that they skip the third march training and launch a direct assault on the main peak next time. He said that after the first two marches, the team members had gained good high-altitude acclimatization and the ability to function in oxygen-deficient conditions and drastically changing temperatures. After the first two marches, the high-altitude camps had stockpiled enough food to cope with adverse weather conditions, and the mountaineering team had good cold-weather equipment. The problems that were originally planned to be solved during the third march training have now been solved. Therefore, it is not necessary to go through the third march training, and the main peak can be climbed directly next time. Speaking of this, all the team members immediately became active, because this was almost the unanimous opinion of the team members after the second march.
    Comrade Shi Zhanchun cited the mountaineering experience of various countries in the world, especially the specific experience in China's young mountaineering history, to illustrate that this proposal was a positive one. He also put forward some guarantees for climbing the main peak this time. These guarantees are: the team members have a high level of morale to win glory for the motherland; timely weather forecasts from Kashgar; the team members have strong strength; excellent high-altitude equipment and sufficient food; experienced team members who are familiar with the terrain; the team members are not carrying heavy loads, averaging only fifteen kilograms per person; and effective measures are taken for possible climate changes, team members' illnesses, and other unforeseen accidents. The most important of these is the ideological guarantee, which is the high sense of responsibility and unwavering confidence in victory that all mountaineers have for the honor of the motherland.
    In the afternoon, all the team members discussed this new proposal in groups, and no one disagreed. People's hearts had already flown to the summit of Muztagh Ata, which was about to be conquered.

    登山日记

      队部会议
    6月27日。
    大队一下山，队部立即召开了会议。在队部的“蒙古包”里，队长许竞、指导员王凤桐、副队长袁扬（女）、石竞和阎栋梁等队部领导同志都围坐在毡子上。起初是汇报第二次行军锻炼中，队员高山适应情况和体力消耗情况。大家一致认为：这次登山高山适应情况比起三年前中、苏混合登山队攀登慕士塔格山来，比起他们经历过的历次登山活动来，都大有提高。连女队员的高山反应，也要比三年前攀登慕士塔格山时许多男队员良好得多。四十多个男、女登山队员没有一个垮下来的。高山上普遍的反应只是轻微的头痛。这自然是由于近年来队员的艰苦锻炼，而特别是由于这次大本营的高度比三年前提高了近五百米，也从一开始就使队员们锻炼出了更好的高山适应性。
    登山队队长许竞综合了上述的情况，他说：“我们每经过一次锻炼，就会取得更好的高山适应性。现在队员的适应性非常好，而体力却相对地降低。我们原来的计划是再进行第三次行军锻炼，到第四次进军时才夺取主峰。这之间，虽然队员们的高山适应性提高了，但体力却又降低了。这是一个矛盾。”
    国家体委登山处处长史占春原来若有所思地半躺着，忽的一下坐了起来，他高兴地说：“我们是否可以取消第三次行军锻炼，下一次就攀登主峰？”经他这一提，谈论的主题一下子就转变到了要不要第三次行军的问题上了。毡房中你一言我一语，立刻热闹起来。
    如果取消第三次行军，那么下一次的行军就比六千二百米还要高出一千三百四十六米。队员的高山适应性如何？登山队队长许竞举出了攀登贡嘎山主峰的例子，最后一次行军锻炼的高度距主峰有一千三百九十多米，这次也只剩下一千三百四十六米，是完全可以安全到达山顶的。
    就这样，越讨论越深刻。最后，大家又分析了这一次攀登主峰的有利条件和困难因素。决定把这一重要问题明天交全体登山队员讨论。
      新的决定
    6月28日。
    上午十时，国家体委登山处处长史占春向全体队员提出了不经过第三次行军锻炼，下一次就突击主峰的建议。他说，经过前两次行军，队员们已经获得了良好的高山适应性，以及在缺氧和骤烈变化的气温下活动的能力。经过前两次行军，高山营地上已储备了足以应付遇到恶劣气候时所需要的食品，再加上登山队有着良好的御寒装备。这些本来计划要在第三次行军锻炼时所要解决的问题，现在已经解决了，因此，可以不必经过第三次行军锻炼，下一次就直接攀登主峰。讲到这里，全体队员立刻活跃起来，因为，这几乎是第二次行军以后队员们一致的意见。
    史占春同志列举了世界各国的登山经验，特别是我国年轻的登山历史中的具体经验，来说明这个建议是一个积极的建议。他并提出了这次攀登主峰的一些保证。这些保证是：队员有为祖国争光的高度士气；有喀什及时的气象预报；队员坚强的实力；优良的高山装备和充足的食品；有熟悉地形的老队员；队员负重不重，平均每人只有十五公斤；以及有可能发生气候变化、队员生病和其他不能预料的各种事故所采取的有效措施。其中最主要的是思想保证，是全体登山运动员为了祖国的荣誉的高度责任感和对于胜利具有的坚毅的信心。
    下午，全体队员分组讨论了这个新的建议，大家没有一个不同意的。人们的心，早已飞到即将被征服的慕士塔格山顶上去了。
                      （三续）
