Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest Dispatch: Our correspondent reports: Romania's industrial sector overfulfilled its production plan for the first half of this year. Heavy industry fulfilled 103.8% of its plan, and consumer goods industry fulfilled 100.3%. Compared with the first half of last year, heavy industrial production increased by 20.5%, and consumer goods industrial production increased by 10.3%.

    In the first half of this year, the iron and steel industry overproduced 54,000 tons of steel and more than 22,000 tons of pig iron. Compared with the first half of last year, steel production increased by 35.1%, and iron production increased by 11.6%. The rapid growth of iron and steel production has promoted the vigorous development of the machinery manufacturing industry. The production of machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries increased by 19.5% compared with the first half of last year. The output of steam boilers, trucks, and tractors increased by 40%-60% compared with the first half of last year. Oil drilling equipment increased by 138%.

    In the first half of this year, the production of consumer goods was also very significant. During this period, the light industrial sector overproduced more than 2 million meters of cotton and woolen fabrics, more than 110,000 pairs of leather shoes, and more than 600,000 pieces of knitwear.

    In the first half of this year, crude oil extraction and crude oil processing plans were overfulfilled by 0.3%. Crude oil processing products increased by 400,000 tons compared with the first half of last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest Dispatch: Romania's summer harvest work has basically ended. News from various places shows that the per unit area yield of crops such as wheat and barley has greatly increased compared to the past.

    According to calculations based on the harvested portions, the per unit area yield of wheat and barley this year is an average of 1,424 kilograms per hectare for wheat and 1,814 kilograms for barley. Compared with 1958, the per unit area yield of wheat and barley this year increased by 45% and 29% respectively. Compared with the bumper harvest year of 1957, they increased by 14% and 34% respectively.

    Another feature of Romania's summer harvest work this year is that many state-owned farms have achieved high yields on small plots of land and bumper harvests on large areas. This achievement was obtained by deep plowing, using improved varieties, and strengthening field management. The "Tremia Mare" state-owned farm in Timisoara County harvested an average of 7,200 kilograms of wheat per hectare on seven hectares of land, which is six times more than the national average per unit area yield of wheat last year, creating an unprecedented record for wheat per unit area yield. Romania's summer harvest work this year is proceeding quite smoothly. All localities have made preparations such as repairing agricultural machinery, allocating transportation vehicles, and organizing labor forces before the harvest began.

    罗上半年工业生产计划超额完成
    重工业和轻工业比去年同期增长20.5％和10.3％
    今年麦类单位面积产量比过去大大提高
    新华社布加勒斯特电　本社记者报道：罗马尼亚工业部门超额完成了今年上半年的生产计划。重工业完成计划的103.8％，消费品工业完成100.3％。同去年上半年相比，重工业生产增长了20.5％，消费品工业的生产增长了10.3％。
    今年上半年，钢铁工业超计划生产了五万四千吨钢和两万两千多吨生铁。同去年上半年相比，钢产量增长了35.1％，铁产量增长了11.6％。钢铁生产的迅速增长推动了机器制造业的蓬勃发展。机器制造和金属加工工业的生产比去年上半年增长了19.5％。蒸汽锅炉、载重汽车、拖拉机的产量比去年上半年增加了40％—60％。石油钻井设备增加了138％。
    今年上半年，消费品的生产成绩也很显著。在此期间，轻工业部门超额生产了两百多万公尺的棉织品和毛织品、十一万多双皮鞋，和六十多万件针织品。
    今年上半年，原油开采和原油加工计划超额完成了0.3％。原油加工产品比去年上半年增加了四十万吨。
    新华社布加勒斯特电　罗马尼亚的夏收工作已经基本结束。各地传来的消息表明，今年小麦和大麦等作物的单位面积产量比过去大大提高。
    今年小麦和大麦的单位面积产量根据已经打完的部分计算，小麦平均每公顷是一千四百二十四公斤，大麦是一千八百一十四公斤。同1958年比较，今年小麦和大麦的单位面积产量分别提高了45％和29％，同丰收的1957年比较，分别提高了14％和34％。
    罗马尼亚今年夏收工作的另一个特点是，许多国营农场都获得了小块土地的高产和大面积丰收。这个成绩是靠深翻土地、采用良种、加强田间管理等方法取得的。底米索拉州的“特雷米亚马雷”国营农场有七公顷土地平均每公顷收了七千二百公斤小麦，比去年全国小麦的平均单位面积产量多六倍，创造了前所未有的小麦单位面积产量纪录。罗马尼亚今年的夏收工作进行得相当顺利。各地在收割开始前都作好了检修农业机器、调配运输工具和组织劳动力等准备工作。
