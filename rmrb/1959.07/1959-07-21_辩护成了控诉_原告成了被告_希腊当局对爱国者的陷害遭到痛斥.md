Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 20th: According to TASS, the defense speeches continued on the evening of the 18th and the 19th at the court hearing of Glezos. It can be said that the speeches of the most famous lawyers in Greece were nominally defenses, but in reality, they were fierce accusations against the Greek authorities' attempt to frame innocent people through judicial means.

　　Defense lawyer Kanellopoulos protested the military court's attempt to try parties and ideologies in his speech. He accused some people in this court of trying to portray every Greek Communist Party member as a spy and pointed out that the military court had no right to hear the defendant's case.

　　Kanellopoulos then said that his client, Singlaris, who had worked in the Greek Communist Party for fifteen years, was a respectable person. It should be remembered that during the era of the fascist Gestapo, Singlaris stood firm for Greece. The court has no evidence to prove that he is guilty. The accusation is based on the fabrications of the police authorities.

　　Defense lawyer Bikakis said that the whole world is expecting the members of the military court to make a fair judgment. He said that he opposed the prosecutor's attempt to exert pressure on the court's judgment with his own statement, which stated that the court should make a decision to "defeat world communism." Bikakis said that the accusation that the Greek Communist Party is a spy and traitor organization is unfounded, and the accusation that the defendant engaged in espionage activities has neither legal basis nor any other basis.

　　Defense lawyer Mangakis exposed the lie repeated by the prosecutor on the 18th about the meeting between Glezos and Koryannis.

　　The defense lawyer said that some defendants are communists, but they cannot be tried as spies because of this.

　　Defense lawyer Skouriotis pointed out that if a verdict is made against the defendant, it would mean that absurd claims would prevail, and it would be equivalent to saying that every communist is a spy.

　　The Greek public continues to express outrage at the deliberate persecution of Greek patriots. "Dawn Daily" pointed out that the trial process shows that the plaintiff does not have the facts to prove that the defendant engaged in espionage activities. The newspaper demanded the unconditional release of the innocent Glezos and other defendants and the transfer of their cases to civil courts. The Committee for the Defense of Glezos and Democratic Traditions also pointed out in a statement that the accusation that the defendant engaged in "espionage activities" is purely nonsense, and the purpose of doing so is to create the necessary tense atmosphere for the implementation of various conspiracy plans, including the plan to establish atomic bases in Greece. The committee demanded the release of the defendants and the transfer of their cases to civil courts in telegrams to the Greek King, Prime Minister, and government officials. One hundred and sixty-two lawyers in Athens also made the same request in a memorandum to the government.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, July 17th: Ali Yata, First Secretary of the Moroccan Communist Party, sent a telegram to Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis, protesting the Greek authorities' trial of Greek patriot Glezos and demanding a verdict of innocence and the release of Glezos.

　　Moroccan workers expressed anger and injustice at the trial of Glezos, and they wrote letters to the Greek Embassy in Morocco to protest.

### 辩护成了控诉　原告成了被告  希腊当局对爱国者的陷害遭到痛斥

    辩护成了控诉　原告成了被告
    希腊当局对爱国者的陷害遭到痛斥
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社雅典诉：18日晚间和19日在审讯格列索斯的法庭上继续进行辩护发言。可以说，希腊最著名的律师们的发言在名义上是辩护，实际上却是对希腊当局企图对无辜者进行司法陷害的激烈控诉。
    辩护人卡内洛普洛斯在发言时对军事法庭审判党派和意识形态的企图表示抗议。他指责在这个法庭上有人企图把每一个希腊共产党员都说成是间谍，并且指出军事法庭无权审理被告的案件。
    卡内洛普洛斯接着说，他的被辩护人、在希腊共产党内工作了十五年的辛格拉里斯是一个值得尊敬的人。应该记住，在法西斯盖世太保时代，辛格拉里斯曾经为了希腊而坚强不屈。法庭没有任何证据证明他是有罪的。控告是建筑在警察当局的臆造的基础上的。
    辩护人比卡基斯说，全世界都在期待军事法庭成员作出公正的裁判。他说，他反对检察长企图用自己的声明向法庭裁判施加压力的做法，这个声明说什么法庭应该作出
  “挫败世界共产主义”的决定。比卡基斯说，控告希腊共产党是间谍和叛国组织是毫无根据的，控告被告从事间谍活动既没有法律根据，也没有任何其他根据。
    辩护人曼加基斯揭穿了检察长在18日所重复的由于格列索斯同科里雅尼斯会见的谎言。
    辩护人说，某些被告是共产党人，但是不能因此把他们当作间谍来审讯。
    辩护人斯库里奥蒂斯指出，如果对被告提出判决，那就意味着使荒谬绝伦的主张得逞，就等于说每个共产党员都是间谍。
    希腊公众对蓄意迫害希腊爱国者的做法继续表示愤慨。“黎明日报”指出，审判过程说明，原告没有可以证明被告进行间谍活动的事实。报纸要求无条件释放无罪的格列索斯和其他被告，并把他们的案件转交民事法庭。保卫格列索斯和民主传统委员会在声明中也指出，控告被告进行“间谍活动”纯系无稽之谈，这样做的目的是为实现各种阴谋计划，其中包括在希腊建立原子基地的计划制造必要的紧张气氛。委员会在给希腊国王、首相和政府官员的电报中要求释放被告和把他们的案件转交民事法庭。雅典一百六十二位律师在给政府的备忘录中也提出同样的要求。
    新华社拉巴特17日电　摩洛哥共产党第一书记阿里·亚塔打电报给希腊首相卡拉曼利斯，抗议希腊当局对希腊爱国者格列索斯的审讯，并且要求作出无罪判决，释放格列索斯。
    摩洛哥劳动者对审讯格列索斯一事表示愤怒和不平，他们纷纷写信给希腊驻摩洛哥大使馆表示抗议。
