Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 20th: Autumn locusts are currently hatching in some areas of Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hebei provinces. In order to seize the favorable opportunity and thoroughly eliminate the autumn locusts, the Civil Aviation Administration of China recently held a national professional work conference in Zhengzhou to summarize and exchange the experiences of the above five provinces in aircraft control of summer locusts this year, and to deploy new tasks for aircraft control of autumn locusts.

This year, in areas where summer locusts occurred, in addition to the active prevention and control of locusts by the local masses, the number of locust-killing aircraft dispatched by the state in the first half of this year increased by more than three times compared with last year. The area treated by aircraft was approximately 11.1 million mu, with a locust-killing efficiency of over 95%. This has powerfully supported agricultural production.

Although the achievements in aircraft control of summer locusts this year have been great, due to the wide area and high density of summer locusts, prevention and control in many areas were not thorough, leaving many residual adults and a large number of eggs laid. It is estimated that the area in the five provinces where autumn locusts may occur is approximately 16 million mu. Therefore, the task of eradicating autumn locusts is still very urgent.

In response to this situation, the conference called on all localities to establish and improve organizational structures for aircraft locust control, actively adopt technical measures, give full play to the role of aircraft locust control, actively tap potential, and vigorously support locust-affected areas.

    河北　河南　山东　江苏　安徽用飞机除治秋蝗
    据新华社郑州20日电　目前河南、山东、江苏、安徽、河北等省部分地区的秋蝗正孵化出土，为了抓紧有利时机，彻底消灭秋蝗，最近中国民用航空局在郑州举行的全国专业工作会议，总结和交流了上述五省今年飞机防治夏蝗的经验，部署了飞机防治秋蝗的新任务。
    今年发生夏蝗的地区，除当地群众积极防治蝗虫以外，国家今年上半年出动的灭蝗飞机比去年增加了三倍多，飞机治蝗面积约一千一百多万亩，杀蝗效率达95％以上。从而有力地支援了农业生产。
    今年飞机治夏蝗的成绩虽然很大，但由于夏蝗发生的面积较广，密度较大，不少地区防治不彻底，残留成虫多，产卵多，预计五省可能发生秋蝗面积约一千六百万亩，因此，剿灭秋蝗的任务仍然十分急迫。
    针对这种情况，会议要求各地建立和健全飞机治蝗的组织机构，积极采取技术措施，发挥飞机治蝗的作用，积极挖掘潜力，大力支援蝗区。
