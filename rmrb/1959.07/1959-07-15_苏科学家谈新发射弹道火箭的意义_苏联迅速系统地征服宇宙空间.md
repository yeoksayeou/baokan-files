Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 13th: Following the successful launch of another geophysical ballistic rocket on the 10th, Soviet Academy of Sciences Corresponding Member Tsenkevich spoke to a TASS reporter, pointing out the great significance of this rocket launch.

Tsenkevich first pointed out that Soviet scientists are rapidly and systematically conquering outer space. He said: The rocket launched on the 10th measured the infrared radiation of the Earth and its atmosphere, photographed clouds over a large area, and conducted other scientific investigations.

The news that the rocket also carried experimental animals was particularly gratifying to biologists. This is no longer an isolated experiment; it has developed into a broad and systematic experiment on the condition of living organisms in outer space. We are proud that the Soviet Union was the first in the world to begin this planned and extremely important experiment. From the dog "Brave," we can successfully observe the effects of various cosmic phenomena on the same organism, and in particular, thoroughly study the formation process of its adaptive functions.

Tsenkevich also said: The fact that the effective weight of the rocket has been planned to increase to 2,200 kilograms is of great significance. The repeated successful experiments of sending living organisms into outer space bring us closer to the most interesting and important next stage—human travel to space.

    苏科学家谈新发射弹道火箭的意义
    苏联迅速系统地征服宇宙空间
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日消息：苏联在10日又成功地发射了一个地球物理弹道火箭后，苏联科学院通讯院士曾凯维奇对塔斯社记者发表了谈话，指出了这次发射火箭的巨大意义。
    曾凯维奇首先指出，苏联科学家在迅速而有系统地征服宇宙空间。他说：10日所发放的火箭，测量了地球和地球大气的红外线的辐射，对在很大区域的云体进行了摄影，并对其他科学项目进行了考察。
    关于火箭又载有试验动物的消息，使生物学家特别感到满意。这已经不是个别的试验，它已经发展为对生命机体在宇宙空间的状况进行广泛的有系统的试验了。我们感到自豪的是，苏联在全世界第一个开始了这种有计划的和极其重要的试验。从小狗“勇士”身上，我们能够成功地观察宇宙的各种现象对同一机体的作用，特别可以彻底研究它的适应机能的形成过程。
    曾凯维奇还说：火箭的有效重量已经有计划地增加到两千二百公斤，这一事实有重大意义。把生物送往宇宙空间的一次又一次的试验成功，使我们更接近最有兴趣和最重要的下一阶段——人到宇宙中去旅行的阶段。
