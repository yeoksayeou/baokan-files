North Vietnam is Advancing Towards Socialism
	Deng Gang
More than a month ago, a delegation of Chinese journalists visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It was the season when the early rice was nearing harvest, and the golden fields on both sides of the Red River were enchanting with the scenery of a bumper harvest. We were very fortunate to have the opportunity to share the joy of this harvest with the Vietnamese people. The great achievements of the Vietnamese people in building socialism made us even more excited, and we could not calm down for a long time.
May 7th this year marked the fifth anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu victory. In the Vietnam Revolutionary History Museum in Hanoi, we reviewed the history of this great battle. Was it not this battle five years ago that finally ended the French imperialist colonial rule in Vietnam? Five years have passed, and no matter how ferociously the American imperialists are still obstructing the peace and unification of this country today, the completely liberated North Vietnam, under the leadership of the Vietnam Labor Party, has firmly embarked on the path of socialism.
At a time when the tasks of national and democratic revolution have not yet been completed throughout Vietnam, the North is embarking on socialism, which is the characteristic of the current situation in Vietnam.
What we see now in the vast land of North Vietnam is: the years of suffering are gone forever, and new factories are being built one after another on the ruins of pillboxes. The liberated people are engaged in the peaceful construction of socialism with endless energy. People have healed the wounds of war, and the economy is developing rapidly in the direction of socialism at an unprecedented speed.
Five years is only a short time for builders. But in terms of construction achievements, it has far exceeded the limitations of time. Look at the situation of grain production: after the restoration of peace, the rice output in North Vietnam increased rapidly, and by 1956, it had far exceeded the level of 1939, the year with the highest rice output during the French occupation, increasing from 2.4 million tons to 4.13 million tons. Speaking of the situation of grain production during the French occupation, people cannot help but recall that before the victory of the August Revolution in 1945, 2 million people starved to death in the North alone! In 1957, due to natural disasters, the rice output in North Vietnam decreased slightly, but it still reached 3.95 million tons. Last year, the late rice in the North had an unprecedented bumper harvest, and the total rice output for the year reached 4.57 million tons, while the rice output in the South in the same year was only 3.17 million tons, which was lower than the level of 4.3 million tons of rice output in the South in 1939. According to the plan, the total rice output in the North this year will reach 6.2 million tons, and the unit area yield of early rice will also increase from 1,200 kg per hectare in 1939 to about 2,000 kg. In some areas, the unit area yield of early rice this year is estimated to reach 2,700 kg to 2,800 kg per hectare, which is about the same as the unit area yield of late rice last year, which will be unprecedented in Vietnamese history. In this way, the total agricultural output value in the North this year is estimated to increase by 38.8% compared with last year. And the total output of 6.2 million tons of rice will also be close to the total rice output of the entire Indochina during the French rule in normal years.
The rapid growth of grain output in North Vietnam is certainly not accidental. During our visit, we saw the tremendous efforts made by the Party and the government to increase grain production. The consistent care of the Party and the government, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, for agricultural production has inspired the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers. In the past five years, the Party and the government have led the masses to restore and newly build many water conservancy projects. The earthwork for water conservancy construction in the first four months of this year increased thirteen times compared with 1957 and four times compared with last year. A large-scale water conservancy plan to control the Red River has been formulated. The amount of fertilizer applied has increased significantly. Various specifications of close planting are being promoted and tested according to local conditions. In the past, only 10 kilograms of seeds were used per hectare, but now it has generally increased to 70 to 80 kilograms per hectare. But more importantly, under the active education and leadership of the Labor Party, the political and ideological consciousness of the farmers has been greatly improved, so they are leaving the individual economy and embarking on the road of socialist collectivization. Agricultural collectivization is the main basis for improving farming techniques and increasing crop yields.
This year is the second year of North Vietnam's implementation of the three-year plan for developing and transforming the economy and developing culture. One of the main tasks is to vigorously promote the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private capitalist industry and commerce, and in the entire socialist transformation work, agricultural cooperation is a major link.
We visited the Xianfeng Elementary Agricultural Production Cooperative in Thai Nguyen Province and the Wu Luo Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hai Duong Province respectively. These two agricultural production cooperatives have not been organized for a long time, but as long as they embark on the road of cooperation, the superiority in production is immediately demonstrated. Last year, there was a drought, and the Wu Luo Cooperative drained water in time for transplanting rice seedlings, and harvested 300 kilograms more per Vietnamese mu (one hectare equals 2.7 Vietnamese mu) than individual farmers. This year, the early rice yield per mu of the Wu Luo Cooperative is estimated to reach 1,690 kilograms, while last year, before the cooperative was organized, the early rice yield per mu was only 670 kilograms. As production increased, the income of the cooperative members also increased. Taking Yang Wenma, the acting director of the Wu Luo Cooperative, as an example, before joining the cooperative, his income was only 80 dou per season, but after joining the cooperative, his income quickly increased to 102 dou. In this way, the benefits of cooperation have attracted widespread attention from the masses through the examples of existing cooperatives. The light of socialist collectivization has illuminated the direction for the advancement of the vast number of farmers. More and more farmers are eagerly demanding to participate in and organize cooperatives. Mutual aid and cooperation have become a widespread mass movement in the vast rural areas of North Vietnam.
The new growth of the socialist trend in the rural areas of North Vietnam is prominently manifested in the unprecedented development speed of the cooperative movement. The number of farmers participating in cooperatives accounted for only 8% of the total number of farmers in April this year. This is the latest figure we obtained during our visit. However, by the end of May, according to the "People's Daily" report on June 23, it had increased to 19.6%. In fact, this development speed had already begun to appear at the end of 1958. According to the responsible comrades of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, the original plan for the entire North in 1958 was to establish only 234 agricultural production cooperatives, but by the end of the year, the number of cooperatives had actually developed to 4,900. Chen Zao, chairman of the Administrative Committee of Hai Duong Province, said that in his province, the number of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives has reached about 50% of the total number of farmers. In Pingjiang County, where there are the most cooperatives, 68.7% of the farmers have participated in the cooperatives. He estimated that Hai Duong Province could basically be collectivized after the late rice crop this year.
In order to adapt to the new and important changes in the vast rural areas of North Vietnam towards socialism, to further strengthen the leadership of the cooperative movement, and to prepare for the arrival of the upsurge of the rural socialist revolution, the Sixteenth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party determined that the current policy of the agricultural cooperative movement is: "Actively lead, advance steadily; comprehensively plan, adapt to local conditions; complete the task of agricultural cooperation in a good, stable, and economical manner." The Tenth Session of the National Assembly, which was recently held, also passed a resolution on agricultural cooperation, calling on all cadres, troops, and people to enthusiastically support the agricultural cooperation movement in order to guide the rural areas of North Vietnam onto the path of socialism.
On May 9, we visited the Tong Jiao State-owned Farm near Nam Dinh. In order to promote the development of socialist agriculture, North Vietnam has established fifteen state-owned farms with 50,000 hectares of land. Their task is to directly provide various agricultural products to the state, and to play a demonstrative role in production, farming techniques, and business management. The Tong Jiao State-owned Farm mainly grows coffee and raises livestock; it was originally a plantation run by the French, and it was completely barren when it was taken over. Now tractors have reclaimed 1,000 hectares of land, of which 400 hectares have been planted with coffee. After drinking a cup of fragrant coffee, we followed the owner in a car through the newly reclaimed coffee plantation. The farm land was vast and boundless. On the distant hillside, herds of fat cattle were grazing, and the newly planted coffee seedlings were a tender green... As we looked at it, we naturally felt a kind of beauty and happiness.
At the same time as developing agricultural production and carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture, socialist industry in North Vietnam is also being established at a rapid speed. The long-term colonial rule of the French imperialists over the Vietnamese people left the Vietnamese people with a very weak industrial base. In the entire national economy, the proportion of modern industry is less than 10%, and it is still a pile of broken stalls. In the days of suffering from enslavement, mentioning industry could only be a symbol of the colonialists' exploitation and endless disasters for the vast number of working people. Of course, it is difficult to build a people's own industry on such a foundation: there is no resource exploration data, no heavy industry, and no or very few technical cadres and workers. But can these difficulties scare the Vietnamese people? In fact, with the creative labor of the Vietnamese people and the support of the socialist brother countries, industrial production has been restored to the level of 1939 in less than three years. Not only have some of the original enterprises that were destroyed been restored and developed, but also new industries are springing up like mushrooms after a rain.
The state invests about 50% of all state capital construction investment in industrial construction every year in order to develop socialist industrial production. At present, some major industrial enterprises have been controlled by the state, and the scope of transformation of private capitalist industry is being expanded. It is estimated that by the end of this year, 55.5% of the total output value of industry and handicrafts will belong to the socialist and semi-socialist economy.
From some of the factories, mines, and basic construction sites we visited, we can see the major achievements that have been made on the entire industrial front in North Vietnam. In the Nam Dinh Textile Factory, the textile center of Vietnam, the production tasks are overfulfilled every year. In the past few years, the newly added looms have doubled the old looms. High-grade cotton fabrics such as poplin and khaki, which could not be produced in the past, can now be produced. In the Hai Phong Cement Factory, this year's output will be twice the output during the War of Resistance. The cement produced by this factory is supporting China's construction. In some newly built factories, such as the Hanoi Medium-sized Machine Tool Factory, the Dong Xuan Knitting Factory, the Tongyi Wood Factory, and the Fu Shou Tea Factory, we saw many of the latest modern equipment from socialist brother countries, along with technology, selflessly handed over to the Vietnamese people; and the young Vietnamese workers have also quickly mastered it. In Viet Tri, a light industrial center with industries such as power generation, papermaking, sugar making, and chemical industry is under construction in full swing, and will be put into production one after another from the second half of this year. What is even more exciting is that in the near future, the Vietnamese people will have their own iron and steel industry for the first time. An iron and steel joint enterprise with an annual output of 200,000 tons will soon begin construction in Taiyuan.
According to the materials we obtained from the Vietnam National Planning Commission: this year, the total output value of industry and handicrafts in North Vietnam will increase by 41% compared with last year. It is estimated that by the time the three-year plan is completed next year, the proportion of the output value of industry and handicrafts in the entire national economy will increase from 25% to 35.3%.
Socialist transformation is also accelerating in the commercial field. At present, state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives have controlled the vast majority of the market in wholesale trade. In retail trade, the proportion of state-owned and cooperative commerce will increase from 42.6% to 55.5% this year, while private commerce will decrease from 44.3% to 20%, and the rest will be state capitalist commerce.
This time, the Chinese journalists' delegation stayed in Vietnam for a total of one month. Whether in cities, factories, or rural areas, what we saw was a thriving scene of building socialism. The economic face of North Vietnam has been and is undergoing profound changes. It proves the superiority of the socialist system with undeniable facts. The great achievements of North Vietnam in building socialism encourage the people of the South to more resolutely fight heroically against the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The socialist North has become the material foundation and consolidated base for the Vietnamese people to unify their motherland. History will develop in the direction of socialism, and this has become a foregone conclusion in Vietnam. It seems that the US imperialists and their running dog Ngo Dinh Diem have not learned the lessons they should have learned from the Dien Bien Phu campaign five years ago. The US imperialists, who dream of inheriting the colonial mantle of the French imperialists in Vietnam, will hardly escape the same fate as the French imperialists encountered five years ago. It will not be long before history will make this ruthless conclusion.

    越南北方正向社会主义迈进
    邓岗
    一个多月以前，中国新闻工作者代表团在越南民主共和国作客。正是早稻临近收割的季节，红河两岸，金色的土地上，丰收的景色迷人。我们十分幸运，能有机会和越南人民同在一起享受一次丰收的欢乐。越南人民建设社会主义的巨大成就，更使我们心情激动，许久都不能恢复平静。
    今年5月7日，是奠边府大捷五周年。在河内的越南革命历史博物馆里，我们重新温习了这一伟大战役的历史。不正是五年前的这个战役，最后结束了法帝国主义在越南的殖民统治吗？五年过去了，不管美帝国主义者今天还在怎样穷凶极恶地阻挠着这个国家的和平和统一，可是，完全解放了的越南北方，在越南劳动党的领导下，却已坚定地走向了社会主义。
    在民族和民主革命任务还没有在越南全国范围内完成的时候，北方正走上社会主义，这便是当前越南形势的特点。
    现在，我们在越南北方广大土地上所看到的是：苦难的年代已经一去不复返了，就在碉堡林立的废墟上，新的工厂一个接着一个地建立了起来。解放了的人民正以无穷无尽的精力从事着社会主义的和平建设。人们已经医治好了战争的创伤，经济正在朝着社会主义的方向以空前的速度飞跃发展。
    五年，这对于建设者说来，只能是短暂的。但从建设的成就来看，却已远远地超过了时间的局限。请看粮食生产的情况：和平恢复后，越南北方的稻谷产量迅速增长，到1956年，就已远远地超过了法国占领时期稻谷产量最高的1939年的水平，由二百四十万吨增加到四百一十三万吨。提起法国占领时期粮食生产的情况，人们不禁就要回忆起，在1945年8月革命胜利以前，北方一次就曾饿死二百万人！1957年，在越南北方，由于受到自然灾害，稻谷的产量略有下降，但仍达三百九十五万吨。去年北方晚稻空前丰收，全年稻谷的产量达到了四百五十七万吨，而同年南方稻谷的产量则只有三百一十七万吨，反而降到1939年南方稻谷产量四百三十万吨的水平以下去了。根据计划，今年北方稻谷的总产量将达六百二十万吨，早稻的单位面积产量也将由1939年的每公顷一千二百公斤提高到二千公斤左右。有些地区今年早稻的单位面积产量估计每公顷可达二千七百公斤到二千八百公斤，约等于去年晚稻单位面积的产量，这将是越南历史上从未有过的。这样，今年北方农业的总产值估计就将比去年增长38.8％。而六百二十万吨稻谷的总产量，也将接近法国统治时期整个印度支那通常年份稻谷产量的总和了。
    越南北方粮食产量的迅速增长当然不是偶然的。我们在访问中看到了党和政府在为增产粮食方面所作的巨大的努力。以胡志明主席为首的党和政府对农业生产的一贯关怀，鼓舞着广大农民的生产热情。五年来，党和政府领导群众恢复和新修了许多的水利工程，今年头四个月兴修水利的土方就比1957年增加了十三倍，比去年也增加了四倍。一个规模宏大的根治红河的水利规划已经拟定。施肥量显著的增加了。各种规格的密植正在因地制宜地提倡和试验，过去每公顷用种子才十公斤，现在则已普遍增加到每公顷七十至八十公斤。但更为重要的则是在劳动党的积极教育和领导下，农民的政治思想觉悟有了很大的提高，因而正纷纷离开个体经济，开始走上社会主义集体化的道路。农业的集体化，这是改进耕作技术，提高作物产量的主要基础。
    今年是越南北方执行发展和改造经济、发展文化三年计划的第二年。主要的任务之一就是要大力推进对农业、手工业和私营资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，而在整个社会主义改造工作中，农业合作化又是一个主要的环节。
    我们曾分别访问了太原省的先锋初级农业生产合作社和海阳省的武罗高级农业生产合作社。这两个农业生产合作社都还组织不久，但只要一走上合作化的道路，生产上的优越性立刻就显示出来了。去年天旱，武罗合作社及时戽水插秧，比单干户每越亩（一公顷等于二点七越亩）多收三百公斤。今年武罗合作社的早造亩产估计可达一千六百九十公斤，而去年在未组织合作社以前，早造的亩产只有六百七十公斤。生产增加了，社员的收入也随着增加。以武罗合作社代社长杨文马一家为例，未入社前，一造收入只有八十斗，入社以后，收入就迅速增加到一百零二斗。就是这样，合作化的好处，通过已有合作社的实例引起了群众广泛的注意，社会主义集体化的光芒，照亮了广大农民前进的方向，越来越多的农民迫不及待地要求参加和组织合作社，变工合作在越南北方的广大农村已经成为一个广泛的群众运动。
    越南北方农村社会主义趋势的新的增长，突出地表现在合作化运动出现了前所未有的发展速度。参加合作社的农户，今年4月还只占农户总数的8％，这是我们在访问期间所得到的最新数字，可是到了5月底，据“人民日报”6月23日的报道，就已经增加到19.6％了。其实，这种发展速度，在1958年底，便已开始显现。据劳动党中央农村工作部负责同志告诉我们，1958年全北方原计划只建立二百三十四个农业生产合作社，但到年底，合作社实际上已发展到了四千九百个。海阳省行政委员会主席陈造同志说，他那个省里，目前参加农业生产合作社的农户，已达农户总数的50％左右，合作社最多的平江县，已有68.7％的农户参加了合作社。他估计海阳全省在今年晚造以后，就可以基本上合作化了。
    为了适应越南北方广大农村趋向社会主义的新的重要变化，进一步加强对合作化运动的领导，准备迎接农村社会主义革命高潮的到来，越南劳动党中央第十六次全会（扩大）确定目前农业合作化运动的方针是：“积极领导、稳步前进；全面规划、因地制宜；好、稳、省地完成农业合作化任务。”最近召开的国会第十次会议也通过了关于农业合作化问题的决议，号召全体干部、部队和人民热烈支持农业合作化运动，以便引导越南北方农村走上社会主义。
    5月9日，我们访问了南定附近的同郊国营农场。为了推动社会主义农业的发展，越南北方已经建立了拥有五万公顷土地的十五个国营农场。它们的任务是为国家直接提供各种农业产品，并且在生产上、耕作技术上和经营管理上起示范的作用。同郊国营农场以种植咖啡和饲养牲畜为主；原是法国人经营的一个庄园，接收时已经完全荒芜了。现在拖拉机已垦出了一千公顷的土地、其中四百公顷种上了咖啡。我们在喝过了一杯香味浓烈的咖啡之后，随着主人乘车在新开垦的咖啡园里穿行，农场土地广阔无垠，远处的山坡上，肥壮的牛群正在放牧，新植的咖啡幼苗一片嫩绿……看着看着，我们自然地感到了一种美和幸福。
    就在发展农业生产和对农业进行社会主义改造的同时，越南北方的社会主义工业也以很快的速度建立了起来。法帝国主义对越南人民长期的殖民统治，留给越南人民的工业基础是十分薄弱的。在整个国民经济中，现代工业的比重不到10％，而且还是一堆破烂的摊子。在被奴役的苦难日子里，提到工业，只能是殖民主义者对广大劳动人民进行敲骨吸髓的压榨和无穷灾难的一种象征。在这样的基础上来建立人民自己的工业，当然是有困难的：没有资源的勘察资料，没有重工业，没有或只有很少的技术干部和工人。但是，这些困难能吓倒越南人民吗？事实上是，在越南人民创造性的劳动和各社会主义兄弟国家的支援下，不到三年，工业生产就已经恢复到了1939年的水平。不仅被破坏的原有的一些企业恢复和发展了，而且新的工业正在雨后春笋一样的诞生。
    国家为发展社会主义的工业生产，每年用于工业建设的投资约占全部国家基本建设投资的50％左右。目前，一些主要的工业企业都已为国家所掌握，并且正在扩大对私营资本主义工业的改造面。预计到今年年底，工业和手工业总产值的55.5％将属于社会主义和半社会主义的经济。
    从我们访问过的一些工厂、矿山和基本建设工地里，可以看到越南北方整个工业战线上所已经取得的重大成就。在越南纺织中心的南定纺织厂，每年都超额完成生产任务。几年来，新增加的织布机已为旧有织布机的一倍。过去所不能生产的府绸、咔叽等高级棉布现在也能生产了。在海防水泥厂，今年的产量将达到抗战时期产量的两倍，就是这个厂生产的水泥，正在支援着中国的建设。在一些新建的工厂里，如河内的中型机床厂、冬春针织厂、统一木材厂以及富寿的茶叶厂，我们看到了许多来自各社会主义兄弟国家的最新的现代化设备，连同技术一起，无私地交给了越南人民；而年青的越南工人，也已经迅速地掌握了它。在越池，一个拥有发电、造纸、制糖、化工等工业的轻工业中心正在紧张地施工，从今年下半年起，就将陆续投入生产。更加令人兴奋的是：在不久的将来，越南人民就将历史上第一次有自己的钢铁工业，一个年产二十万吨的钢铁联合企业，很快就要在太原破土施工了。
    据我们从越南国家计划委员会获得的材料：今年越南北方工业、手工业的总产值，将比去年增长41％。预计到明年三年计划完成时，工业、手工业的产值在整个国民经济中的比重就将由25％增加到35.3％。
    社会主义改造也在商业领域里加速进行。目前，国营商业和供销合作社已在批发方面掌握了绝大部分市场。在零售方面，今年国营和合作社营商业所占的比重，将由42.6％增加到55.5％，而私营商业则将从44.3％下降为20％，其余则是国家资本主义的商业。
    这次中国新闻工作者代表团在越南一共逗留了一个月，无论是在城市、工厂和农村，我们所看到的都是蓬蓬勃勃的建设社会主义的兴旺景象。越南北方的经济面貌已经和正在发生着深刻的变化，它以无可置疑的事实证明着社会主义制度的优越性。越南北方建设社会主义的巨大成就，鼓舞着南方人民更加坚决地同美国—吴庭艳集团进行英勇的斗争。社会主义的北方，已经成为越南人民统一自己祖国的物质基础和巩固的基地。历史将朝着社会主义的方向发展，这在越南已成定局。看来，美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳并没有从五年前的奠边府战役中得到应有的教训，梦想在越南继承法帝国主义殖民衣钵的美帝国主义者，将难逃脱同法帝国主义者在五年前所遇到的同样的命运。用不着多久，历史就将作出这个无情的结论。
