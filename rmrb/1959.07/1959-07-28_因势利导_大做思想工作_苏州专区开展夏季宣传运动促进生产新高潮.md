Special Correspondent Fan Wanjun reports: The Suzhou Special District in Jiangsu Province is vigorously carrying out a summer production propaganda campaign, emphasizing the current situation, guiding actions based on circumstances, educating cadres and the masses, raising ideological levels, boosting morale, and promoting a new upsurge in summer agricultural and sideline production.

	The Situation is Infinitely Good
	Suzhou Special District achieved a double leap in agriculture and sideline occupations in the first half of the year. Summer crops increased production across the board, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries prospered, and the total agricultural income increased by 18% compared with the first half of last year. Sideline income increased by 33.9%. More than 90% of commune members increased their income in the summer distribution, everyone was satisfied, and everyone was happy. The production enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and the masses is unprecedentedly high. On the basis of the bumper harvest of summer crops, a movement to exceed contract production and exceed plans is being launched to strive for a bumper harvest in autumn crops.
	However, people's understanding is not consistent. In areas with particularly large bumper harvests, some people are complacent, satisfied with existing achievements, and stop moving forward. In areas with average harvests, they are content to be in the middle and do not seek to improve. In areas with poor harvests, they complain and blame the weather, emphasize poor conditions, and relax subjective efforts. Leading comrades of the Suzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China went deep into the countryside after the summer harvest to specifically observe and analyze the current rural situation, and instructed the county committees to seize the favorable situation of the summer harvest and carry out a large-scale propaganda and education movement, guiding actions based on circumstances and doing a great job in ideological work.
	In early and mid-July, the county committees successively held conferences of cadres above the level of production team leader to comprehensively summarize the experiences and lessons of the summer harvest. After the meeting, the method of "one pole to the bottom" was adopted to implement it among the masses. Now this large-scale propaganda and education movement has achieved remarkable results.
	
	Look at Achievements and Grasp the Mainstream
	Analyzing the situation starts with looking at achievements and grasping the mainstream, and after analyzing the reasons, the goal is to boost morale.
	The Zhouzhuang People's Commune in Jiangyin County distributed an average of 14.7 yuan per person in this year's summer distribution. When the commune members received the money, they were still "baffled," and reflected: "What's going on? This year, Zhangjiagang dug up a lot of land, why is the dividend more than last year?" The commune party committee then mobilized the masses to discuss and found three reasons: First, production is doing well, and the income from agriculture and sideline occupations this year increased by 13.4% compared with last year; second, cost savings are good, and the total expenditure of the whole commune decreased by 20% compared with last year; third, the party's distribution policy is well implemented. After analysis, the commune members' thinking became clear. They said: "First, there must be something in the pot before there can be something in the bowl; if you want to increase income, you must first do a good job in production." In just seven days, the commune members completed the processing of 5,509 mu of rice, topdressing of 14,000 mu, and accumulated 1.65 million dan of fertilizer, increasing work efficiency by 25%.
	
		Set Up Opposing Sides
	Setting up opposing sides, publicizing differences, encouraging the advanced, and promoting the backward are prominent features of this propaganda campaign. The entire region has set up thousands of opposing sides with the same conditions but different yields, educating people to correctly understand people's subjective initiative and break the theory of solely relying on conditions.
	After a comprehensive ranking, Changshu County announced the differences and found that there were 69 brigades and 997 teams that were originally low-yielding but have now become high-yielding, and 34 brigades and 379 teams that were originally high-yielding but are now low-yielding. By publicizing the differences, comparing each other, finding the reasons, and improving understanding, the advanced were encouraged and the backward were promoted to catch up with the advanced. The Fourth Brigade of the Xinglong Commune in the county has very poor conditions, with 41% of low-lying fields and 32.7% of fields that are subject to waterlogging all year round. Last year, the yield of three wheat crops per mu was 150 jin. This year, due to the establishment of a high-standard drainage system to prevent waterlogging, and the full implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agricultural production increase, the average yield of 600 mu of three wheat crops in the whole team reached 315 jin, an increase of 110% compared with last year. The Eleventh Brigade, which had very good conditions and a three-wheat yield of 220 jin last year, relaxed its subjective efforts due to being satisfied with its existing achievements. Although the three-wheat yield this year reached 255 jin, an increase of 16% compared with last year, the absolute number was 60 jin lower than the Fourth Brigade, which had poor conditions. The Xinglong Commune Party Committee seized this typical case and launched a large-scale discussion in the whole team. Through discussion, everyone unanimously realized that people are the masters of objective conditions, not the slaves of objective conditions. No matter how superior the conditions are, if there is no enthusiasm, high yields cannot be achieved. Conversely, even if the conditions are poor, as long as subjective efforts are strengthened, unfavorable conditions can be changed and unfavorable factors can be overcome, and high yields can also be achieved. The cadres of the Fourth Brigade were encouraged by the discussion and expressed their determination to guard against arrogance and impetuosity and move forward victoriously. The cadres and commune members of the Eleventh Brigade found the root of the problem in the discussion and deeply accepted the lesson. All the commune members braved the rain to topdress the rice and attack the autumn harvest, vowing to win high yields.

	Trees Grow Thousands of Feet Tall, Leaves Return to Their Roots
	There are many reasons for the bumper harvest in high-yield areas, but ultimately it is due to the correct leadership of the Party and the correct implementation of the Party's instructions. Conversely, the reason why a few places do not have high yields is precisely because they have not seriously implemented the Party's instructions. Many places have further improved their understanding of this issue through comparison and discussion. The natural conditions of the Xinta and Xiagang brigades in the Dianxi Commune of Kunshan County are the same, and the soil quality of Xiagang is better, and the yield has been 20% higher than that of Xinta in previous years. Last year, the yield of three wheat crops per mu in the Xinta Brigade was 151 jin, and that of Xiagang was 200 jin. However, this year the yield per mu in the Xiagang Brigade was only 170 jin, while that of the Xinta Brigade reached 300 jin. The main reason is that the Xinta Brigade resolutely implemented the Party's instructions and promoted advanced technical measures such as close planting, fine varieties, deep plowing, and fertilization; the Xiagang Brigade still used old methods to cultivate the land, with only a dozen catties of seeds and 20 dan of base fertilizer, and did not select fine varieties. After comparison and discussion, everyone came to an important experience: listening to the Party's instructions and promoting advanced technical measures can lead to a bumper harvest; violating the Party's instructions and believing in old experience will reduce income.

    因势利导　大做思想工作
    苏州专区开展夏季宣传运动促进生产新高潮
    本报南京27日电
  特约通讯员范万钧报道：江苏省苏州专区大张旗鼓地开展夏季生产的宣传运动，大讲形势，因势利导，教育干部群众，提高思想水平，鼓足干劲，促进夏季农副业生产运动的新高潮。
    形势无限好
    苏州专区上半年农业副业双跃进，夏熟作物样样增产，林牧副渔项项兴旺，农业总收入比去年上半年增加18％；副业收入增加33.9％；夏季分配90％以上的社员增加了收入，人人满意，个个欢喜，广大干部和群众的生产积极性空前提高。在夏熟作物丰收的基础上，正在开展着超包产、超计划运动，为争取秋熟丰收而斗争。
    但是人们的认识是不一致的。特大丰收的地区，有些人沾沾自喜，满足于已有成绩，停步不前；收成一般的地区，甘居中游，不求上进；收成较差的地区，怨天尤人，强调条件不好，放松主观努力。中共苏州地委各负责同志，夏收后分头深入农村，具体观察和分析了当前农村形势，指示各县委抓住夏熟丰收满堂红的有利形势，大张旗鼓地开展宣传教育运动，因势利导，大做思想工作。
    各县委于7月上、中旬先后召开生产大队长以上干部大会，全面总结了夏熟丰收满堂红的经验教训。会后采取一竿插到底的方法，贯彻到群众中。现在这一大规模的宣传教育运动已收到显著效果。
      看成绩抓主流
    分析形势从看成绩抓主流入手，经过分析原因，达到鼓足干劲的目的。
    江阴县周庄人民公社今年夏季分配每人平均分到十四点七元，社员拿到钞票还是“丈二和尚摸不到头脑”，反映说：“怎么搞的，今年开张家港挖掉很多土地，为什么分红反而比去年多？”公社党委就发动群众讨论，找到三个原因：第一，生产搞得好，今年农副业收入比去年增加13.4％；第二，节省开支好，全社总支出比去年减少20％；第三，执行党的分配政策好。经过分析，社员们的思想明确了，他们说：“先要锅里有，碗里才能有；要想增加收入，先要搞好生产。”全社社员在短短七天中，完成水稻加工五千五百零九亩，追肥一万四千亩，积肥一百六十五万担，工效提高25％。
        设置对立面
    设置对立面，公布差别，鼓舞先进，促进落后，是这次宣传运动中的一个显著特点。全区设置了成千上万个条件相同产量不同的对立面，教育人们正确认识人的主观能动性，大破唯条件论。
    常熟县经过全面排队，公布差别，发现全县原来是低产队而现在变为高产队的有六十九个大队、九百九十七个小队，原来高产现在低产的有三十四个大队、三百七十九个小队。通过公布差别，相互比较，找出原因，提高认识，既鼓舞了先进，也促进落后赶先进。该县兴隆公社第四大队条件很差，有41％的低田，常年受涝田占32.7％，去年三麦亩产一百五十斤。今年由于建立了高标准排水系统，防止了内涝，同时全面推行了农业增产八字宪法，全队六百亩三麦的平均产量达到三百十五斤，比去年增产110％。条件很好、去年三麦产量二百二十斤的十一大队，由于满足已有成绩，放松主观努力，虽然今年三麦产量达到二百五十五斤，比去年增产16％，但绝对数却比条件差的四大队低了六十斤。兴隆公社党委抓住这一典型事例，发动全队大讨论。通过讨论，大家一致认识到人是客观条件的主人，而不是客观条件的奴隶，不管条件如何优越，如果没有干劲，那就无法取得高产；反之，尽管条件较差，只要加强主观努力，不良条件可以改变，不利因素可以克服，同样可以取得高产。第四大队干部通过讨论，受到鼓舞，表示戒骄戒躁，乘胜直上。第十一大队干部和社员在讨论中找到问题的根子，深刻地接受了教训，全体社员冒雨对水稻加工追肥，猛攻秋熟，誓夺高产。
    树高千丈，叶落归根
    高产地区丰收原因很多，但是归根到底是由于党的正确领导，是由于正确执行了党的各项指示。反过来，少数产量不高的地方，正是由于没有认真执行党的指示。许多地方通过对比、讨论，对这个问题的认识得到进一步提高。昆山县淀西公社辛塔和狭港两个大队自然条件相同，土质狭港好，历年产量比辛塔高20％，去年辛塔大队三麦亩产一百五十一斤，狭港二百斤。但今年狭港大队亩产只有一百七十斤，而辛塔大队达到三百斤。主要原因是辛塔大队坚决贯彻执行党的指示，推行了密植、良种、深翻、施肥等先进技术措施；狭港大队却仍旧用老办法种田，播种只有十多斤，基肥二十担，没有选用良种。经过对比讨论，大家得出一条重要经验：听党的指示，推广先进技术措施，就能大丰收；违背党的指示，迷信老经验，就要减少收入。
