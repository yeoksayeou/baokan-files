    Character Creation in the Dance Drama "Hero Qiu An"
    Long Yinpei
    After watching the dance drama "Qiu An" (performed by the amateur naval arts troupe at the Second Army Arts Festival), I felt a strong inner excitement that I hadn't felt in a long time, and I couldn't calm down for a long time.
    This dance drama is based on the true heroic deeds of Comrade Qiu An, an intelligence officer and member of the Communist Youth League from a lookout post of our South China Sea Fleet. In September 1952, more than 140 Chiang Kai-shek bandits, fully equipped with American weapons, launched a surprise attack on Nanpeng Island, which we had liberated not long before. On the island, we had only a few light weapons and one Liberation Army soldier—Qiu An. Under these circumstances, Qiu An and another fisherman cadre organized the fishermen to defend the position, repelled two enemy attacks, eliminated many enemies, and finally Qiu An was seriously wounded and heroically sacrificed. This dance drama portrays Qiu An's character, spirit, and ideological qualities in many ways, and creates a vivid and typical heroic image in a relatively complete way. We can see that the creators of the dance drama, in shaping the heroic figure of Qiu An, made artistic generalizations, concentrations, refinements, and typicalized processing on the basis of real life, so that this character image can be so full and lifelike.
    In the first act, "Liberation," when the Liberation Army soldiers enter and chase the enemy, a young soldier sees an old woman fainted on the road, so he helps her up and kindly pours water from his kettle for her to drink, waking her up. This soldier, who reveals himself to be a good soldier who cares for the masses and loves the people as soon as he meets the audience, is Qiu An. Then, the old woman tells the soldiers about her painful experiences: her son was killed by Chiang Kai-shek bandits, her young daughter was pushed off a cliff by Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and her old partner was also captured and his fate is unknown. A sense of responsibility as a class fighter makes Qiu An jump off the cliff to rescue the suffering fisherman brothers, regardless of everything. When the people on Nanpeng Island are dancing and celebrating the liberation and thanking their benefactor, the Liberation Army, we see Qiu An again, holding the injured little girl and carrying the two enemy guns he captured on the cliff. These few close-up scenes depict Qiu An's quality of cherishing the masses as a people's soldier.
    The second act, scene one "Going to Sea" and scene two "Harvest," depict the life of the fishermen on Nanpeng Island two years after liberation. At this time, we see that Qiu An has already become close to the masses and has become one of the fishermen. He skillfully does labor such as mending nets and weaving nets with everyone; he organized a militia team on this island, and seriously, patiently, and strictly gave the militia training in bayonet fighting, shooting, grenade throwing, and other exercises; he goes out to sea to fish with the fishermen; and when the fishermen have a good harvest, he dances with everyone and shares the joy of the harvest. From here, Qiu An's unique character traits are further expressed. We will feel that the tremendous changes in the lives of the fishermen on Nanpeng Island and the happy and fulfilling life of constantly obtaining a good harvest are closely related to Qiu An's work. He infinitely faithfully carries out the tasks assigned to him by the Party, and because of his meticulous and in-depth work among the masses, he has taken root among the fishermen. Especially in this scene, the creators also arranged for Qiu An and the little girl to carry a basket of fish and dance mischievously around Lin Da Niang, as well as a game dance with the little girl later, highlighting the close relationship between Qiu An and Lin Da Niang's family, as if they were blood relatives.
    Because of the above foundation, in the third act "Battle," it is described that under the organization and leadership of Qiu An, although there are only three guns and eight grenades, they can persist in repelling three attacks by more than 100 enemies with sufficient modern weapons and ammunition, eliminating many enemies, and finally waiting for the arrival of the main force. In this arduous battle, Qiu An wholeheartedly defended the motherland and the safety of the people at all times, putting his own safety behind him. He firmly and calmly directs and leads the masses to fight and resist the enemy's attack. It is also because of this test that the heroic image of Qiu An is even more glorious and fully demonstrates his noble qualities. For example, in the battle, when Lin Da Niang and the little girl brought a fisherman's shirt to Qiu An for his safety, enemy artillery fire came, and Qiu An did not hesitate to block them with his body; when the bullets ran out, he resolutely told the militia captain to lead the masses to hide, and he stayed behind to defend the position and cover the retreat of the masses. How inspiring is this noble quality and style of selflessness!
    In "Hero Qiu An," although it focuses on depicting and portraying the heroic image of Qiu An, it does not neglect the shaping of other characters. For example, Lin Da Niang, Lin Laotou, the little girl, the militia captain Lin Xiao Fa, the fisherman cadre Yang Tingguang, and others also give the audience a very clear impression and have the quality characteristics of heroism in our era. They are always strong, unyielding, and forge ahead in the cruel class struggle; their meticulous care for their comrades is full of class love, and they have deep hatred for the enemy. … Such descriptions not only truly reflect the face of life, but also well set off the heroic figure of Qiu An. In addition, this dance drama mainly uses folk dance and classical dance to create, so that the entire dance drama has a strong national style; at the same time, the folk-flavored dance drama music is also very expressive.

    舞剧“英雄丘安”的人物创造
    隆荫培
    看完舞剧“丘安”（全军第二届文艺会演大会海军业余文艺演出队演出），有一种很久没有感受到的强烈的内心激动，使我久久不能平静下来。
    这个舞剧是根据我南海舰队某了望哨的情报员、共青团员丘安同志真实的英雄事迹创作的。1952年的9月，全副美械装备的蒋贼一百四十余人，偷袭我们解放不久的南澎岛。而岛上我们只有少数的轻武器和一个解放军——丘安。就在这情况下，丘安和另一渔民干部把渔民们组织起来，守卫着阵地，击退了敌人两次进攻，消灭了不少敌人，最后丘安身受重伤，壮烈牺牲。这个舞剧多方面地刻划了丘安的性格特征、精神面貌和思想品质，比较完整地创造出一个生动、典型的英雄形象。我们看得出编导者对丘安这个英雄人物的塑造，是在生活真实的基础上，作了艺术的概括、集中、提炼和典型化的加工，使得这个人物形象能够如此丰满，有血有肉。
    第一幕“解放”，解放军上场追击敌人时，一个年青的水兵见一个老大娘晕倒在路上，便将她扶起，亲切地用水壶灌她喝水，救醒了她。这个和观众一见面就显露出他是一个关心群众、热爱人民的好战士，就是丘安。接着大娘，向水兵们叙说了自己痛苦的遭遇：儿子被蒋贼打死、小女儿被蒋贼推下崖石，老伴也被抓去不知死活。阶级战士的责任感使丘安不顾一切地跳下山崖去解救受难的渔民兄弟。当南澎岛上的人们正在欢舞庆祝解放和感谢恩人解放军的时候，我们又一次看到丘安，他抱着摔伤的小姑娘，背着被缴获敌军的两支枪站在山崖上。这几个特写式的场面，描绘了丘安这个人民子弟兵爱护群众的品质。
    第二幕一场“出海”和二场“丰收”，是描写解放两年后南澎岛渔民的生活。这时，我们见到的丘安已经和群众亲热地打成一片，成了渔民的自己人。他和大伙一道熟练地做着补网、织网的劳动；他在这个岛上组织了民兵队，认真、耐心、严格地给民兵进行刺杀、射击、投弹等操练；他和渔民一道出海打鱼；当渔民们获得丰收时，他又和大家一块欢舞，分享着丰收的喜悦。从这里，丘安所特有的性格特征就被进一步地表现了出来。我们会觉得南澎岛渔民生活的巨大变化，不断获得丰收的幸福美满生活都同丘安的工作有着密切的关联。他无限忠诚地执行着党所交给他的任务，由于在群众工作方面的细致、深入，所以在渔民中扎下了根。特别是在这一场中，编导又安排了丘安和小姑娘抬着一箩鱼围着林大娘调皮的舞蹈，以及后面和小姑娘一起跳的游戏舞，突出地描写了丘安和林大娘一家人亲如骨肉的关系。
    由于有了以上这样的基础，所以在第三幕“战斗”中，描写在丘安的组织领导下，虽然只有三枝枪、八颗手榴弹，就能坚持打退有充足现代武器弹药的一百多敌人的三次进攻，消灭了不少敌人，最后等待大军到来。在这场艰苦的战斗中，丘安时时刻刻一心一意地为了捍卫祖国，捍卫人民的安全，把自己的安危置之脑后。他坚定、沉着地指挥和带领群众进行战斗、顽抗敌人的进攻。也正因为有了这场考验才使得丘安这个英雄形象更增添了光辉，更充分地表现了他那崇高的品质。像在战斗中，林大娘和小姑娘为了丘安的安全给他送来渔民衫时，敌炮打来，丘安毫不犹豫地用身体挡着她们俩；子弹打完了，他又坚决叫民兵队长带领群众隐蔽，自己留下来坚守阵地掩护群众撤退。这种舍己为人的高贵品质和风格是多么激动人心！
    在“英雄丘安”中，虽然集中地描写和刻划了丘安这个英雄形象，同时也没有忽视对其他人物的塑造。如林大娘、林老头、小姑娘、民兵队长林小发、渔民干部杨廷光等人给观众的印象也是很鲜明的，具有着我们这个时代英雄主义的品质特色。他们在残酷的阶级斗争中永远是坚强不屈、奋勇直前；他们对自己同志无微不至的关怀充满了阶级友爱，对敌人则有着刻骨的仇恨。……这样的描写不只是真实地反映了生活的面貌，同时也很好地衬托了丘安这个英雄人物。此外，这个舞剧主要是运用民间舞和古典舞来创造的，因此使得整个舞剧具有浓厚的民族风格；同时，具有民间风味的舞剧音乐也很有表现力。
