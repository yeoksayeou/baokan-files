People's Poland has been born for fifteen years. Today, the entire socialist family is filled with joy, jointly celebrating the glorious festival of the Polish people. The people of socialist countries and all progressive humanity cheer and salute the heroic Polish people! Fifteen years is only a short period in history, but under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish people have already accomplished great undertakings that have shocked the world! As everyone knows, fifteen years ago, the inhumane German fascists carried out four months of thorough destruction of Warsaw before Poland's liberation, wanting to "erase Warsaw from the map" and even to eliminate the Polish nation that had made significant contributions to human civilization. However, in no time at all, Warsaw has long been rebuilt more magnificently from the ruins. Today, Poland stands more gloriously than at any time in its history on the European continent, showing the world with its new socialist appearance that no force in the world can eliminate a heroic nation, and no force can stop the Polish people from advancing victoriously along the road of socialism!

On this day fifteen years ago, July 22, 1944, the Polish Committee of National Liberation, established in Chelm, the first liberated city in eastern Poland, issued the historically significant Declaration to the Polish People. This declaration heralded the beginning of a new dawn in Polish history, the birth of an independent, free, and people's democratic new Poland! Subsequently, the Polish army fought side by side with the Soviet army, liberating the entire Polish territory and the Polish people from the enslavement of Hitler's fascism. Since then, under the leadership of the Polish workers' party, the Polish people have consolidated the people's democratic regime, completed democratic reforms, and victoriously embarked on the broad road of building socialism.

For fifteen years, the Polish people have traveled a glorious and victorious road. As everyone knows, before the Second World War, Poland was an economically backward European country, and at that time it was even the only European country where the level of industrial development was lower than before the First World War. During the Second World War, Hitler's bandits seriously destroyed Poland's industry, agriculture, and transportation, and brutally massacred about one-fifth of the Polish population, and made hundreds of thousands of Polish people lose their labor force. Therefore, the Polish people had to rebuild the country on scarred land. After liberation, under the leadership of the Polish workers' party, the Polish people went through arduous efforts, overcame numerous difficulties, and victoriously completed the three-year plan for restoring the national economy (1947-1949), the six-year plan for developing the national economy (1950-1955), and the first three years of the first five-year plan (1956-1960). Today, Poland has long changed its old face, transforming from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country. Poland has established a strong industrial base and has newly built a series of important industrial sectors such as shipbuilding, aviation, automobiles, and tractors. In 1958, Poland's total industrial output had increased more than five times compared with 1938 before the war, and the total agricultural output had also increased by 30.5% compared with 1949. Culture and science have developed correspondingly, and the people's living standards have also improved significantly.

The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, held in March this year, formulated the seven-year plan for Poland's national economic development from 1959 to 1965, and started a new stage in Poland's socialist construction, showing a brilliant prospect for Poland's development. According to this plan, by 1965, Poland's industrial products will increase by 80% compared with 1958, agricultural products will increase by 30%, the real wages of employees and the real income of farmers will increase by 33% to 35%, housing construction and consumer goods production will be greatly increased, and the people's material and cultural living standards will be greatly improved. The realization of Poland's seven-year plan will not only strengthen the material foundation of Polish socialism, but also strengthen the material strength of the entire socialist camp.

Over the past fifteen years, the Polish people have not only made great achievements in socialist construction, but also made active contributions in the struggle to defend peace, thereby enhancing Poland's international status to an unprecedented level. After the war, Poland achieved national independence, restored its inherent borders, and consistently pursued a foreign policy of peace, advocating peaceful coexistence with all countries in the world. Poland has formed a fraternal alliance with the Soviet Union, and a fraternal alliance with the Warsaw Treaty countries and all socialist countries, standing at the western outpost of the socialist camp, and carrying out a resolute struggle to defend European security and world peace. Poland actively participates in various international organizations and makes unremitting efforts to promote friendly cooperation among countries. Poland strived to promote the realization of the Korean armistice and sent representatives to participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to supervise the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement; later, it accepted the recommendations of the Geneva Conference and sent representatives to participate in the International Commission to supervise the Indochina armistice agreements. Last year, Poland's Rapacki Plan for the establishment of a European nuclear-weapon-free zone received widespread response from peace-loving countries and people around the world, giving a serious blow to the US imperialist conspiracy to conduct nuclear war in Europe, and making an important contribution to easing international tensions. Poland also firmly supports the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic's initiatives on concluding a peace treaty with Germany and ending the occupation system in West Berlin. All these fully demonstrate the Polish people's sincere desire for peace and the lofty spirit of striving for it.

The great achievements made by the Polish people in the past fifteen years are inseparable from the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party. From the earliest years after Poland's liberation, the Polish Party led the people to resolutely take the road of socialism. In recent years, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Gomulka, the Polish United Workers' Party has given a strong rebuff to the domestic reactionary forces attempting to undermine socialism, timely corrected the dogmatism in the past work, and struggled against the most important current danger of revisionism; in economic construction, it has also strived to overcome some difficulties, adjusted the past imbalance in the development of industry and agriculture, so that industry has developed rapidly, agricultural production has also increased; further consolidated the party's leadership position, and strengthened the party's unity with the people. At the same time, the Polish United Workers' Party has also made outstanding efforts in opposing modern revisionism and safeguarding the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement headed by the Soviet Union. These have ensured that Poland can move from victory to victory in the cause of building socialism and defending world peace.

The Chinese and Polish people are close brothers in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, and close comrades-in-arms in the cause of building socialism and defending world peace. Our two peoples have forged an eternal and unbreakable friendship on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism. For nearly ten years, the mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Poland in the political, economic, cultural and other fields have continued to develop and become increasingly consolidated. The agreements on trade, culture, science and technology signed between our two countries, as well as the mutual visits of party and government leaders and various friendly delegations, are important factors in strengthening the friendly cooperation between our two countries. The Polish people firmly support the Chinese people's struggle to defend China's territory of Taiwan. In our country's socialist construction, the Polish people have given our people selfless fraternal help. Here, we once again express our heartfelt gratitude to the Polish people!

Today, as the Polish people celebrate the great festival of their motherland's renaissance, the Chinese people express warm congratulations to the fraternal Polish people, wishing the Polish people new and greater victories in the glorious cause of building socialism and defending peace, wishing the profound friendship between the Chinese and Polish peoples further development, and wishing the People's Republic of Poland and our great socialist camp more consolidated and prosperous!

    庆祝波兰人民的光荣节日
    人民波兰已经诞生十五周年了。今天，整个社会主义大家庭里喜气洋洋，共同庆祝波兰人民的光荣节日。社会主义各国人民和全体进步人类都向英雄的波兰人民欢呼，致敬！十五年，在历史上只是一个短短的时期，可是波兰人民在波兰统一工人党的领导下，已经做出了震惊世界的伟大事业！大家知道：十五年前，灭绝人性的德国法西斯分子，在波兰解放前曾对华沙进行了四个月的彻底破坏，要“把华沙从地图上抹掉”，甚至要消灭曾经对人类灿烂文化作过重大贡献的波兰民族。然而，曾几何时，华沙早已从废墟中重建得更加壮丽。今天，波兰比它历史上任何时期都更加辉煌地站立在欧洲大陆，以它新的社会主义的雄姿，向全世界表明：世界上没有任何力量可以消灭一个英勇的民族，没有任何力量可以阻挡住波兰人民沿着社会主义的大道胜利前进！
    十五年前的今天，1944年7月22日，当时在最先解放的波兰东部海尔姆城成立的波兰民族解放委员会，公布了具有历史意义的告波兰人民宣言，这个宣言宣告了波兰历史上新的黎明时期的开始，一个独立自由的、人民民主的新波兰诞生了！接着，波兰军队同苏联军队并肩作战，把整个波兰国土和波兰人民从希特勒法西斯的奴役下解放出来。从此，波兰人民在波兰工人阶级政党的领导下，巩固了人民民主政权，完成了民主改革，胜利地走上了建立社会主义的康庄大道。
    十五年，波兰人民走过了一段光荣的胜利的道路。大家知道，在第二次世界大战以前，波兰原是一个经济落后的欧洲国家，那时它甚至是欧洲唯一的工业水平比第一次世界大战前还低的国家。而在第二次世界大战期间，希特勒匪徒们又严重地摧毁了波兰的工业、农业和运输业，并且残酷地屠杀了约占波兰人口五分之一的波兰人民，又使成千成万的波兰人民丧失了劳动力。因此，波兰人民不得不在疮痍满目的土地上重建国家。解放后，波兰人民在波兰工人阶级政党的领导下，经过了艰苦的努力，克服了重重困难，胜利地完成了恢复国民经济的三年计划（1947—1949年）、发展国民经济的六年计划（1950—1955年）和第一个五年计划（1956—1960年）前三年的计划。今天，波兰早已改变了旧日的面貌，从一个落后的农业国一跃而成为一个先进的社会主义工业国家了。波兰已经建立了强大的工业基地，并且新建了造船、航空、汽车、拖拉机等一系列的重要工业部门。1958年，波兰工业总产量已比战前1938年增加了五倍多，农业总产量也比1949年增加了30.5％，文化和科学有了相应的发展，人民生活水平也显著地提高了。
    今年3月召开的波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会，拟订了波兰1959—1965年发展国民经济的七年计划，开始了波兰社会主义建设的新阶段，展示了波兰发展的灿烂的前景。根据这个计划，到1965年，波兰工业产品将比1958年增加80％，农产品将增加30％，职工实际工资和农民实际收入将增加33％到35％，住宅建设和消费品生产都将大大增加，人民物质和文化生活水平都将大大提高。波兰七年计划的实现，不仅将增强波兰社会主义的物质基础，而且将增强整个社会主义阵营的物质力量。
    十五年来，波兰人民不仅在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就，而且在保卫和平的斗争中作出了积极的贡献，从而使波兰的国际地位空前地提高了。战后波兰取得了国家的独立，恢复了固有的疆界，一贯执行和平外交政策，主张同世界各国和平共处。波兰同苏联结成了兄弟同盟，同华沙条约国家和所有社会主义国家结成了兄弟同盟，站在社会主义阵营的西部前哨，为保卫欧洲安全和世界和平进行了坚决的斗争。波兰积极参加各种国际组织，为促进各国友好合作进行不倦的努力。波兰努力促进朝鲜停战的实现，并派代表参加中立国监察委员会，以监督朝鲜停战协定的执行；以后又接受了日内瓦会议的建议，派遣代表参加监督印度支那停战协定的国际委员会。去年，波兰提出的建立欧洲无原子武器地区的腊帕茨基计划，获得了世界爱好和平的国家和人民的广泛响应，给美帝国主义在欧洲进行核子战争的阴谋以严重的打击，为缓和国际紧张局势作出了重要的贡献。波兰也坚决支持苏联和德意志民主共和国关于缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度的倡议。所有这些，都充分表现了波兰人民真诚的和平愿望和为之奋斗的崇高精神。
    波兰人民十五年来所取得的巨大成就，是同波兰统一工人党的领导分不开的。从波兰解放后的最初年代起，波兰党就领导人民坚决走社会主义的道路。最近几年来，波兰统一工人党在以哥穆尔卡同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，给予企图破坏社会主义的国内反动力量以有力的回击，及时地纠正了过去工作中的教条主义，并对当前最主要的危险修正主义进行了斗争；在经济建设中也努力克服了若干困难，调整了过去工农业发展的不平衡现象，使工业得到迅速发展，农业生产也得到增长；进一步巩固了党的领导地位，加强了党同人民的团结。同时，波兰统一工人党在反对现代修正主义，维护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结方面，也作了卓越的努力。这些都保证了波兰在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的事业中能够从胜利走向胜利。
    中国人民和波兰人民都是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的亲密兄弟，都是建设社会主义和保卫世界和平事业中的亲密战友。我们两国人民，在马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上，结成了永恒的牢不可破的友谊。将近十年来，中波两国在政治、经济和文化等各方面的互助合作关系不断发展，日益巩固。我们两国之间签订的贸易、文化、科学技术等方面的协定，以及党政领导人、各种友好代表团的互相访问，都是加强我们两国友好合作的重要因素。波兰人民坚决支持中国人民保卫中国领土台湾的斗争。在我国社会主义建设中，波兰人民给予我国人民以无私的兄弟般的帮助。在这里，我们再一次地向波兰人民表示衷心感激之情！
    今天，当波兰人民欢庆自己祖国复兴的伟大节日的时候，中国人民向兄弟般的波兰人民表示热烈的祝贺，祝波兰人民在建设社会主义和保卫和平的光荣事业中取得新的更大的胜利，祝中波两国人民的深厚友谊进一步发展，祝波兰人民共和国和我们伟大的社会主义阵营更加巩固和繁荣！
