Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 11th: Jiangxi Province's 50,000 transferred cadres have been working diligently on over 200 mountains to build non-staple food production bases, making every effort to develop the production of non-staple foods.

Currently, these mountains collectively raise over 570,000 pigs, 4 million chickens, ducks, and geese, and 350,000 rabbits, sheep, and dairy cows. More than 3,000 wineries, pastry shops, and processing plants and workshops for wood ear, shiitake mushrooms, vinegar, and soy sauce have been established. In addition, large quantities of melons, vegetables, peaches, plums, apples, citrus, and other fruit trees have been planted. A large amount of non-staple food is constantly being transported down the mountains to support cities and industrial and mining areas. In the first half of this year alone, 25,000 head of fat pigs, over 1,000 chickens and ducks, and 100,000 jin of fresh eggs have been transferred down the mountains.

The mountainous areas of Jiangxi are very rich. The mountains are covered with grass that can be used to raise pigs and sheep, and thousands of wild plants can be used to brew wine and make pastries. The conditions for developing non-staple food production are excellent. After 50,000 transferred cadres came to the mountainous areas at the end of 1957, they worked hard on over 200 mountains, developing agricultural and industrial production while also developing non-staple food production. They cleared the way, cut down trees, dug the land, and built poultry and livestock pens and processing plants, manufacturing production tools. They were diligent and thrifty, tightening spending on basic construction while also engaging in temporary sideline production, using the income earned as construction funds. Over 1,000 transferred cadres at the Red Star Reclamation Farm built over 300 pigsties by firing bricks and tiles themselves and cutting wood on the mountain, fighting hard for a month. Then, they reclaimed over 3,000 mu of wasteland and planted green fodder crops. Now, the farm has raised over 30,000 pigs. There are over 2,000 kinds of wild plants on Cui Gong Mountain, many of which can be used to brew wine, make sugar, and make biscuits and pastries. The cadres transferred to this mountain built thatched sheds and manufactured equipment. In less than two months, they built 26 non-staple food processing plants. So far, they have brewed more than 27,000 jin of wine and produced hundreds of thousands of jin of pastries and starch.

Many transferred cadres were not familiar with production in the past, but after diligent study, they have now mastered one or several non-staple food production techniques. Damao Mountain is rich in Yangmei berries, and the cadres stationed here learned to use Yangmei berries to brew wine. They sent people to city wineries to study and consulted books, learning and doing at the same time. Within a few months, more than 100 people mastered the complete set of winemaking techniques. Now, two wineries have been established on Damao Mountain, and the Yangmei wine produced is delicious and refreshing, and is very popular in the market. Among the more than 500 cadres at the Nanchang Reclamation Farm, only a dozen cadres originally understood breeding techniques; this year, the reclamation farm launched the "Nine Great Breedings" (raising pigs, cattle, sheep, rabbits, horses, chickens, ducks, geese, bees) campaign, and the cadres all studied breeding and management techniques. Now, 300 cadres at the farm have become experts in raising pigs or poultry. Thousands of cadres at reclamation farms such as Zhanggong Mountain, Guizhu Mountain, and Xishanping learned the techniques of producing white fungus and shiitake mushrooms this year, and established factories for the production of wood ear and shiitake mushrooms, which have begun to produce in large quantities.

In the development of non-staple food production, the transferred cadres have received assistance from forestry and land reclamation, commerce and other departments. Since the beginning of this year, these departments have allocated 3.5 million yuan in funds and supplied a large amount of production materials to help them develop production. In terms of livestock and poultry alone, they have supplied more than 1,000 breeding pigs, more than 10,000 breeding chickens, and 20,000 breeding rabbits. The Provincial Forestry and Land Reclamation Department and the Commercial Department have organized guidance groups with engineers and technicians to travel to various mountains to guide the transferred cadres in production.

    江西五万下放干部奋战两年
    二百个荒山变成副食品基地
    新华社南昌11日电　江西省五万名下放干部在二百多个山头上刻苦建设副食品生产基地，千方百计地发展副食品生产。
    目前，这些山头共饲养有五十七万多头生猪，四百万只鸡、鸭、鹅，三十五万只兔、羊、奶牛；建立有三千多个酿酒、糕点、木耳、香菇、醋、酱等加工厂和作坊；此外还种植了大量瓜菜和桃、李、苹果、柑桔等果树。大量的副食品不断地运下山来，支援城市和工矿区。今年上半年已调运两万五千头肥猪、一千多只鸡鸭和十万斤鲜蛋下山。
    江西山区十分富饶，遍山的青草可以养猪养羊，千百种野生植物可以用来酿酒和制作糕饼，发展副食品生产的条件极好。五万名下放干部于1957年年底来到山区后，在二百多个山头上，一面发展农业工业生产，一面发展副食品生产，刻苦地建设。他们披荆斩棘，伐木挖地，建立起禽舍畜栏和加工厂房，制造出生产工具。他们克勤克俭，一面紧缩基本建设开支，一面经营临时性副业生产，把所得的收入作为建设资金。红星垦殖场一千多名下放干部自己烧砖瓦，上山砍木料，苦战一个月，盖起了三百多栋猪舍，接着，开垦了三千多亩荒地，播种了青饲料作物，现在全场已养生猪三万多头。催功山上有二千多种野生植物，其中有许多种可以酿酒、制糖和制饼干糕点。下放在这个山头上的干部，搭起茅棚，制造设备，不到两个月就建成了二十六个副食品加工厂，到现在已酿造了二万七千多斤酒，生产了几十万斤糕点和淀粉。
    许多下放干部过去不熟悉生产，但是经过努力钻研，现在已掌握了一项或几项副食品生产技术。大茅山盛产杨梅，下放在这里的干部就学习利用杨梅酿酒。他们一面派人到城市酿酒厂学习，一面参看书本，边学边做，几月内就有一百多人掌握了全套酿酒技术。现在，大茅山上建立了两个酿酒厂，生产的杨梅酒味美爽口，极受市场欢迎。南昌垦殖场五百多名干部中，原来只有十多名干部懂得饲养技术；今年这个垦殖场开展“九大养”（养猪、牛、羊、兔、马、鸡、鸭、鹅，蜂）运动，干部们个个钻研饲养管理技术，现在全场已有三百名干部成为养猪或养禽能手。障公山、桂竹山、西山坪等垦殖场的上千名干部，今年学习生产白木耳、香菇等的技术，建立起木耳、香菇生产工厂，已开始大量生产。
    下放干部们在发展副食品生产中，得到了林垦、商业等部门的帮助。今年以来，这些部门拨出了三百五十万元资金，供应了大批生产资料，帮助他们发展生产。仅家畜家禽方面，就供应了一千多只种猪，一万多只种鸡，二万只种兔。省林垦厅、商业厅都组织了有工程师、技术员参加的辅导组，巡回到各山头指导下放干部生产。
