Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 9th: This reporter reports: The broad masses of laboring people in Tibet urgently demand the abolition of the cruel Ula corvée system, personal dependence, and usurious exploitation; to liberate them from the evil abyss of feudal serfdom.

The Tibetan people compare the Ula corvée system, personal dependence, and usurious exploitation to three poisonous snakes缠绕缠绕缠绕缠绕纏繞纏繞缠绕缠绕绕绕绕绕 around them. After the suppression of the rebellion launched by the reactionary upper strata of Tibet, people urgently demanded the implementation of democratic reforms and the abolition of these three kinds of feudal exploitation. The masses in Lhasa, Shannan, Tagong, Qamdo, and Gyantse and other regions have recently held meetings to诉说诉说诉说诉说訴說訴說诉说诉说说说说说说 pour out their suffering; some serfs grabbed the staff they met on the road and倾诉倾诉倾诉倾诉傾訴傾訴倾诉倾诉诉说说说说倾 poured out their tragic lives.

Under the serf system in Tibet, Langsheng (家奴) had the deepest personal dependence, suffered the heaviest oppression of servitude, and had the most urgent demands for reform. In Lajiari County, Shannan, in the house of Lajiari Langji Weicuo, the bandit leader known as the "King of Shannan," there were 62 Langsheng among a total of five family members. In the house of the bandit leader Para Tudeng Wedeng in the Gyantse area, there were more than 60 commonly used Langsheng and more than 40 reserve Langsheng. Para also specially set up a "Jia Ben" (company commander) to manage the Langsheng. The bandit leader Suokang had a total of 301 people in Kaisong Xika in Shannan, of which 51 were Langsheng and "Chayao" (slaves who supported corvée and worked in the fields for the serf owners year after year, similar to Langsheng), accounting for one-sixth of the total population of the entire Xika.

The life of Langsheng is extremely tragic. They are deprived of the right to be human, have no personal freedom, and not only suffer from cold and hunger all year round, and work as unpaid labor for the serf owners under the lash, but their children also have to follow their fathers and daughters follow their mothers to be slaves for the serf owners for generations. Losang, the Langsheng of Songduo, the Cai Zong bandit leader, has been enslaved for 20 years. He has five children, but the serf owner only gives half a bowl of Zanba to the adults every day and does not give rations to the children, causing two of his children to starve to death. Losang suffered from a serious illness and could not work, so the serf owner forced him to pay to hire a worker to replace him. Losang worked like cattle and horses for the serf owner all his life, and finally owed the serf owner an incalculable debt. At a meeting in Nedong County, the three sisters of Langsheng Bazhu and others complained that their grandmother became a Langsheng of the serf owner because of debt repayment. After the grandmother died, the mother inherited it and did it for a lifetime. In their generation, the three sisters and Bazhu's daughter were forced to become Langsheng. Bazhu said that their four generations have been slaves, carrying water and working in the fields for the serf owners all year round. The serf owners only give them a small liter of Zanba (about half a catty) per person per day and a pair of cloth shoes every three years, which is all the reward. When they complained, they held up the serf owner's special small liter and bottomless破靴子靴子靴子破 broken shoes and cried: "Please everyone see how we have lived for generations! Can we still live if we don't reform?"

The Tibetan laboring people hate the brutal Ula corvée system and demand the immediate abolition of this barbaric system. The Ula corvée system in Tibet is divided into two types: payment of grain, property and human and animal labor. There are many names, and the exploitation of the people is extremely cruel. According to the survey, every serf in the Shannan area who plants a Gang of poor land (unequal in size, about 15 to 40 acres per Gang) has to 出乌拉 (the person who supports corvée for the serf owner is also called Ula) two to three people, who serve as unpaid labor for the serf owner all year round, and also have to provide the lord with human corvée, horse corvée, and cattle corvée one hundred or several hundred times a year. In the northern district of Lhasa, farmers who plant half a Gang of land have to 出 one long-term Ula every year, and other odd corvée have to 出 for more than 120 days. Under the Ula corvée system, the serf owners in various places can arbitrarily stipulate names and wantonly levy taxes. In many areas, farmers pay more than 240 kinds of artificial corvée, livestock corvée, in-kind corvée and money corvée, such as耕地差耕地差耕地差耕地耕地耕地耕地 artificial corvée,收割差收割差收割差收割收割收割收割收割收割差差差差差差差收割 harvesting corvée,拔草差拔草差拔草差拔草拔草拔草拔草拔草差差差差差差差差差 weeding corvée,踏场差踏场差踏场差踏场踏场踏场踏场踏场差差差差差差差差差 threshing corvée,运粮差运粮差运粮差运粮运粮运粮运粮运粮差差差差差差差差差 grain transportation corvée,修建差修建差修建差修建修建修建修建修建差差差差差差差差差 construction corvée,送信差送信差送信差送信送信送信送信送信差差差差差差差差差 delivery corvée,磨糌粑差磨糌粑差磨糌粑差磨糌粑磨糌粑磨糌粑磨糌粑差差差差差差差差差 grinding Zanba corvée,做青油差做青油差做青油差做青油做青油做青油做青油做青油差差差差差差差差差 making butter corvée,制藏酒差制藏酒差制藏酒差制藏酒制藏酒制藏酒制藏酒制藏酒差差差差差差差差差 making Tibetan wine corvée,裁缝差裁缝差裁缝差裁缝裁缝裁缝裁缝裁缝裁缝差差差差差差差差差 tailor corvée,揉搓皮革差揉搓皮革差揉搓皮革差揉搓皮革揉搓皮革揉搓皮革揉搓皮革揉搓皮革差差差差差差差差差 kneading leather corvée,纺毛线差纺毛线差纺毛线差纺毛线纺毛线纺毛线纺毛线纺毛线差差差差差差差差差 spinning wool corvée, etc. In short, as long as the serf owner needs it, he can support corvée for anything, and the serfs must be随叫随到随叫随到随叫随到随叫随到随叫随到随叫随到随叫随到随叫随到 on call. In the money corvée, one fee was the welcome banquet fee when the Qing Dynasty驻藏大臣到西藏residing minister in Tibet arrived in Tibet; another was the war indemnity fee when the British invaded Tibet in 1804. These are摊派摊派摊派摊派攤派攤派摊派摊派派派派派派派派派 apportioned by household and have been retained to this day. In some places, people have to pay the "死人消灾费dead person disaster relief fee" when they die. If they suffer from a flood, they have to pay the "受灾税disaster tax." Some temples also stipulate that farmers should invite lamas to念“冰雹经”念“冰雹经”念“冰雹经”念“冰雹经”念“冰雹经”念“冰雹经”念“冰雹经”念“冰雹经” recite the "hail sutra" every year to pray for exemption from hail disasters; if there is no disaster in that year, the farmers have to pay a fee to express their thanks; on the contrary, if hail still falls after reciting the sutra, it is because the farmers are not sincere and must be fined. In short, farmers have to pay whether it hails or not. The Tibetan people have reached the point of unbearable suffering from this cruel exploitation system.

Usury is a barbaric economic plunder and cruel personal persecution of the laboring people by Tibetan serf owners. The vast majority of Tibetan laboring people are oppressed by usury. Therefore, the demand to abolish usurious exploitation has become the unanimous call of the Tibetan laboring people. In Kaisong Xika of the bandit leader Suokang, the average debt of all the serfs, men, women, and children, reached 30克 (each克 is about 25 catties) of grain. In Pangduo Zonglin A Xika, all nine households were in debt, four of which owed more than 1,000克. According to very incomplete statistics, the three major temples in Lhasa (Zhebang, Sera, Gadan Temple) put out more than 1.43 million克 of highland barley and more than 990,000称 (each称 is equivalent to 3.33 yuan) of Tibetan silver in usurious loans every year. Among them, usury accounted for the most important part of the total income of Sera Temple. Many people were forced to bankruptcy by usury and had to flee to other places; some were used as body pledges to become slaves for life; some were tortured and even beaten to death for failing to repay their debts.

The Tibetan laboring people described the disaster of usury as: "Usury is a bottomless pit. Once you fall into it, you can't get out." Some farmers said: "I haven't seen a grain of food, but I owe a thousand克 of debt. If I borrow a debt, my children and grandchildren can't pay it off." Baima Cizeng, a 50-year-old woman from Dongga Zong, complained that her uncle was forced to repay the 15克 old debt left by her grandfather since she was a child. Her uncle repaid it for ten years and handed over 80克 of grain to the serf owner. Not only did he not pay it off, but after 40 years, the debt accumulated to 700克. Her uncle had to flee with his family. The serf owner transferred the debt to her uncle's close relative—Baima Cizeng's mother. Her mother repaid it for 15 years and handed over 225克 of grain. After her mother died, Baima Cizeng inherited the debt. She repaid it for 20 years, a total of 260克 of grain. She did not repay it for the next 16 years, and as a result, the debt turned into 600克 again. She has repaid 32克 in the last four years. Baima Cizeng said: This 15克 old debt has been repaid by three generations of my ancestors for 107 years, and 597克 of grain has been taken out, but it has not been paid off until now, and there are still more than 500克压压压压壓壓压压压压压压 pressing on me. She said: If we don't carry out reform, my children and grandchildren will never be able to pay off this debt.

The Ula corvée system, personal enslavement, and usurious exploitation have brought endless disasters to the Tibetan people. The Tibetan people said that they will never allow these cruel and cannibalistic systems to continue to be maintained. They must斩断斩断斩断斩断斬斷斬斷斩断斩断断断断断断断断 cut off the three poisonous snakes of the feudal serf system缠绕缠绕缠绕缠绕纏繞纏繞缠绕缠绕绕绕绕绕绕绕绕 around them and live a free and happy life with the people of the whole country.

### 西藏广大劳动人民集会诉苦  纷纷要求废除乌拉制度高利贷

    西藏广大劳动人民集会诉苦
    纷纷要求废除乌拉制度高利贷
    新华社拉萨9日电　本社记者报道：西藏广大劳动人民迫切要求废除残酷的乌拉差役制度、人身依附和高利贷剥削；把他们从封建农奴制度的罪恶深渊中解放出来。
    西藏人民把乌拉差役制度、人身依附和高利贷剥削比作缠在他们身上的三条毒蛇。当西藏上层反动集团发动的叛乱平息以后，人们迫切要求实行民主改革，废除这三种封建剥削。拉萨、山南、塔工、昌都和江孜等地区的群众，最近集会诉说自己的痛苦；有些农奴在行路中遇到工作人员，便拉住了他们，倾诉自己的悲惨生活。
    在西藏的农奴制度下，朗生（家奴）的人身依附关系最深、受奴役压迫最重、要求改革也最为迫切。山南拉加里县号称“山南王”的叛匪头子拉加里·朗吉纬错家里，共五口人，就有六十二个朗生。在江孜地区叛匪头子帕拉·土登为登的家里，有六十多个常用的朗生，还有四十多个预备的朗生，帕拉还专门设有“甲本”（连长）来管理朗生。叛匪头子索康在山南的凯松溪卡，共有三百零一口人，其中朗生和“差摇”（长年为农奴主支差和作田间劳动的奴隶，类似朗生）就有五十一个，占全溪卡人口总数的六分之一。
    朗生的生活极为悲惨，他们被剥夺了作人的权利，毫无人身自由，而且不仅自己整年受冻挨饿、在皮鞭下终身为农奴主作无偿的劳役，就是自己的子女，也要子随父、女随母世代为农奴主当奴隶。蔡宗叛匪头子松多的朗生洛桑已经被奴役了二十年，他有五个小孩，但农奴主每天只给大人发半碗糌粑，不给小孩子发口粮，使他的两个小孩活活饿死。洛桑患重病不能劳动，农奴主就逼着他出钱雇工顶替，洛桑像牛马一样地为农奴主劳动了一生，最后还欠下农奴主算不清的债。乃东县朗生巴珠等三个姊妹在一次集会上控诉说，她们的外祖母因为抵债作了农奴主的朗生，外祖母死后母亲继承下来干了一辈子，到了她们这一代，姊妹三个和巴珠的女儿，又都被强迫当了朗生。巴珠说，她们四代为奴，终年给农奴主背水、下田，农奴主每人每天只给她们一小升糌粑（半斤左右），三年给一双布靴子，就是全部报酬。在控诉时，她们举着农奴主特制的小升和没底的破靴子哭着说：“请大家看看，我们世世代代是怎样活过来的！再不改革还能活下去吗？”
    西藏劳动人民痛恨暴虐的乌拉差役制度，要求立即废除这种野蛮制度。西藏的乌拉差役制度分为缴纳粮食财物和人畜劳役两种，名目繁多，对人民的剥削极其残酷。据调查，山南地区农奴每种一岗差地（大小不等，每岗约十五亩到四十亩），就要出乌拉（为农奴主支差的人也叫乌拉）二至三人，长年为农奴主服无偿劳役，每年还要另外给领主出人差、马差、牛差一百或几百次。在拉萨北区，农民种半岗地每年除支付一个长年乌拉外，其他零差要出一百二十天以上。在乌拉差役制度下，各地的农奴主都可以随意规定名目，横征暴敛。很多地区农民所支付的各种人工差、牲畜差、实物差和钱差等，共有二百四十多种，例如人工差中有耕地差、收割差、拔草差、踏场差、运粮差、修建差、送信差、磨糌粑差、做青油差、制藏酒差、裁缝差、揉搓皮革差、纺毛线差等，总之，农奴主只要需要，什么事都可以支差，农奴们必须随叫随到。在钱差中，有一种费用是当年清朝驻藏大臣到西藏时的欢迎宴会费；还有一种是1804年英国侵入西藏时的战争赔偿费，这些都按户摊派，而且一直保留到现在。有些地方死了人，要交“死人消灾费”。受了水灾要交“受灾税”。有些寺庙还规定农民每年要请喇嘛念“冰雹经”，祈祷免除冰雹灾害；如果当年没有遭灾，农民要交费表示酬谢；相反，如果念经后还是下了冰雹，就是由于农民心不诚，必须罚款。总之，下冰雹或不下冰雹，农民都必须交款。西藏人民对这种残酷剥削制度，已经到了无法忍受的地步。
    高利贷是西藏农奴主对劳动人民一种野蛮的经济掠夺和残酷的人身迫害。绝大多数西藏劳动人民都受到高利贷的压榨，因此，要求废除高利贷剥削，已经成为西藏劳动人民一致的呼声。在叛匪头子索康的凯松溪卡，全体农奴男女老幼，平均每人欠债达三十克（每克约合二十五斤）粮食。在旁多宗林阿溪卡，九户人家全部负债，其中有四户负债都达一千克以上。根据很不完整的统计，拉萨三大寺（哲蚌、色拉、噶丹寺）每年放出的高利贷，青稞就有一百四十三万多克，藏银达九十九万多秤（每秤合人民币三元三角三分）。其中色拉寺的总收入中，高利贷占了最主要的部分。许多人被高利贷逼得倾家荡产，不得不逃亡他乡；有的以身抵债，终身变为奴隶；有的因为还不起债而受到酷刑，甚至被活活打死。
    西藏劳动人民形容高利贷的灾难说：“高利贷是个无底洞，掉进去就出不来”。有的农民说：“未见一粒粮，欠下千克债，借下一笔账，子孙还不清”。东噶宗一位五十多岁妇女白玛次登控诉说：她的叔父从小就被迫偿还祖父遗留下的十五克旧债，叔父还了十年，给农奴主交了八十克粮食，不但没还清，到四十年后，这笔债利滚利累积到七百克，叔父不得不全家逃亡。农奴主就把这笔债转移到她叔父的近亲——白玛次登的母亲身上，她母亲还了十五年，交了二百二十五克粮食；她母亲死后，白玛次登继承了这笔债务，她还了二十年，共还粮二百六十克，以后十六年未还，结果这笔债又变成六百克，最近四年还了三十二克。白玛次登说：这笔十五克旧债，我祖宗三代还了一百零七年，拿出五百九十七克粮食，直到现在还没有还清，还有五百多克压在身上。她说：如果不进行改革，我的子子孙孙是永远也还不清这笔债的。
    乌拉差役制度，人身奴役和高利贷剥削给西藏人民带来了无穷的灾难。西藏人民表示决不允许这些残酷的吃人制度再继续保持下去，一定要斩断封建农奴制度缠在他们身上的这三条毒蛇，和全国人民一起过自由幸福的生活。（附图片）
