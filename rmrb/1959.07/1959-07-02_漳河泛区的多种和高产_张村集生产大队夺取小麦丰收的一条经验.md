    Multiple Cropping and High Yields in the Zhanghe River Floodplain
    An Experience of Zhangcunjia Production Brigade in Winning a Bumper Wheat Harvest
    By Our Correspondent Wen Ying

    During the wheat harvest in the Hebei Plain, I arrived at the Zhangcunjia Production Brigade of the Linzhang Town People's Commune in Cixian County, a place that used to be low-yielding but achieved a bumper harvest this year. At that time, more than 9,200 mu of wheat here were being harvested. Thousands of people were rushing to harvest, wielding scythes and racing against time. The tractor station also sent people to drive Polish-style wheat harvesters to help with the harvest. Rows upon rows of wheat-laden carts transported the wheat to the threshing ground, piling it into mountains. Wheat threshers worked day and night. Looking at this moving scene, people would not have thought that this was the famous low-yielding area of the Zhanghe River floodplain in the past.

    Comparing the average per-mu wheat yield of this brigade this year with that of last year, everyone will be amazed at their tremendous production achievements. This year, the brigade's wheat field increased by 7.67% compared with last year, but the total output increased by 137.7%, and the average per-mu yield increased by 120.8%. Wheat production doubled! This change is truly exciting. The people who live here know their past, so they understand the meaning of this change best.

    The wheat fields of the Zhangcunjia Production Brigade are close to the north bank of the Zhanghe River. In the past, there were frequent floods, and many cultivated lands were alkalized. Every year when seeds were sown, it was difficult to preserve six or seven out of ten seedlings, and people were unwilling to put more effort into management. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the Zhanghe River Dam has been built, and farming techniques have also been improved. Wheat production has increased year by year: the average per-mu yield increased from dozens of jin in the past to 110 jin in 1957; last year, there was another increase; this year, the production doubled, which is a great leap forward.

    On a cool summer night, I talked with some commune members and cadres on the threshing ground about the experience of the bumper harvest. The leadership of the commune, the cooperation of the teams, the enthusiasm of the people, the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture… they all talked about it with great interest. These are the common experiences of this year's bumper wheat harvest in the province. As the conversation lengthened, they also talked about the twists and turns and lessons they learned in the struggle to win this year's bumper wheat harvest. Only because they were able to make decisive decisions and determine their resolve were they able to reverse the situation and achieve a large-scale increase in production.

    The twist was this: Before planting wheat last year, due to the establishment of the people's commune and the experience of the Great Leap Forward in production, everyone was determined to quickly improve the appearance of this place and change from low yield to high yield. The goal of doubling wheat production was set under this circumstance. During the discussion, some people cited the wheat in the experimental field of the Southwest Street Production Team, which had reached more than 800 jin per mu; the millet experimental field of the Shencun Production Team, which had reached 1,000 jin per mu. Everyone believed that to harvest more, they had to find ways to get as much grain as possible from one mu of land. This is the direction to strive for more harvest. Once the direction was set, everyone was determined to go all out for the high-yield plots.

    In the 9,200 mu of land planned for planting wheat, 1,500 mu of good land with self-flowing irrigation was selected. Thirty-two production teams were designated to manage it carefully. This land was deeply plowed, more than 7,000 jin of base fertilizer were applied per mu, all channels were repaired, more than 30 old wells were reamed, and three more mechanized wells were drilled. It really achieved the double insurance of good soil, abundant fertilizer, and channel and well irrigation. Planting was dense, with 25 to 30 jin of seeds sown per mu, all of which were selected improved varieties. People's interest and attention were focused on the high-yield plots. In order to strengthen the management of the high-yield plots, Zhang Ju, the secretary of the general branch, took the lead, and five production team leaders were also absorbed to form the high-yield plot command; more than 1,000 young and middle-aged people were drawn from the 32 production teams to form a wheat professional team; and a management system of branch secretaries in charge of areas, production team leaders in charge of blocks, and each laborer in charge of several rows, from planting to harvesting, was adopted. Not only that, each professional team also organized a technical research group composed of technicians, youth, middle-aged, and veteran farmers, specializing in studying and improving wheat management techniques. Among the professional teams, a red flag competition was launched with inspections every ten days and evaluations every half month. During the wintering management, returning green, jointing, booting, and grain-filling stages, people really took care of the wheat meticulously. The young men of the professional teams collected human urine from door to door every morning, regardless of wind and snow, and carried it to the high-yield plots. The 1,500 mu of high-yield wheat were irrigated with human urine once. Later, more than 3,000 jin of coarse fertilizer and 200 jin of soil fertilizer were added per mu; hoeing after each watering, a total of four or five waterings and hoeings were carried out in one winter and spring.

    After the Qingming Festival, when the entire brigade was inspecting and evaluating wheat, the high-yield plots were naturally ranked at the top. However, many of the large wheat fields outside those high-yield plots were like children without mothers, yellow and thin. Although these wheat fields were also deeply plowed, and the amount of seeds sown was comparable to that of the high-yield plots, they had less base fertilizer, insufficient topdressing and watering, and lacked people to manage them. Seeing the scene, some old farmers and team leaders muttered while inspecting and evaluating: "These wheat plants are being wronged! It seems that we will have a smaller harvest." "It's not too late to work harder now." These words reminded Zhang Ju, the secretary of the general branch. He immediately mobilized the production teams to classify the large areas of wheat fields outside the plots. In this way, the problem was revealed: among the 7,760 mu of wheat fields outside the plots, only 2,120 mu of wheat grew well, 3,600 mu of Class II wheat were relatively yellow and weak, and 2,040 mu were Class III wheat. According to the situation at the time, the highest average yield of each type of wheat field was 150 jin, 120 jin, and 80 jin. If no remedies were taken, even if the high-yield plots had high yields and more harvests, the total output target could not be completed.

    After discussion by the general branch committee, the brigade convened a meeting of production team leaders and activists among young people, middle-aged people, and veteran farmers to ask everyone for ideas. Zhang Ju, the secretary of the general branch, reported an account to everyone: wheat in the entire brigade, high-yield plots only accounted for 16.19% of the total wheat field area; wheat fields outside the plots accounted for 33.8%. Even if the high-yield plots had high yields, the reduced production of wheat outside the plots would lead to failure of the production increase plan. As long as the problem is seen, everyone can come up with a solution. After some discussion, it was decided to first add fertilizer and water, and also put forward the slogans "Class III catches up with Class II, Class II catches up with Class I, and Class I catches up with the high-yield plots" and "Evaluation every ten days, upgrading at the end of the month."

    As soon as the slogans and methods were put forward, a high tide of upgrading management of large-scale wheat fields was set off throughout the brigade. Combined with the spring sanitation campaign, a fertilizer accumulation campaign was launched, using various methods such as dismantling (dismantling old kangs, old walls, etc.), digging (digging manure pits, toilets, pig, sheep, and cattle pens, etc.), and cleaning (cleaning houses, courtyards, and streets), accumulating more than 23,000 carts of fertilizer, with an average of three carts of topdressing fertilizer per mu, and some reaching four or five carts. Dozens of soil fertilizer plants produced more than 500,000 jin of soil fertilizer in more than ten days, with more than 100 jin applied per mu. In some wheat fields that were difficult to water, commune members dug more than 30 through-channel wells, and wheat fields lacking water were irrigated. Some production teams even applied 10 jin of fertilizer powder per mu to particularly weak Class III seedlings. After this remedy, the wheat fields quickly changed, the stalks became thick and strong, and the leaves turned green with a hint of black. During the evaluation at the end of April, all types of wheat fields were generally upgraded. Except for the fact that the number of tillers was slightly smaller due to insufficient fertilizer and water in the early stage, the original Class II and III wheat fields were not inferior to the wheat in the high-yield plots in terms of stalk height and ear length. The land does not betray people's labor. After such efforts, the harvest from more than 7,800 mu of wheat outside the high-yield plots was nearly doubled per mu compared with the original estimated yield.

    The Zhangcunjia Production Brigade has achieved a bumper wheat harvest. The cadres and commune members of this brigade have also gained a valuable experience. They said: "High yield and multiple cropping are needed to harvest more grain."

    漳河泛区的多种和高产
    张村集生产大队夺取小麦丰收的一条经验
    本报记者　文英
    在河北平原小麦收获的日子，我到了过去低产、今年丰收的磁县临漳镇人民公社张村集生产大队。当时，这里的九千二百多亩小麦正在收割。上千的抢收大军，挥舞着镰刀和时间赛跑。拖拉机站也派人驾驶着波兰式小麦收割机前来帮助抢收。成行成列的运麦大车，把小麦运到场上，堆成了山。小麦脱粒机昼夜不停地工作着。看了这幅动人的景象，人们不会想到这就是过去有名的低产地区——漳河泛地。
    把这个大队今年的小麦平均亩产量和去年比较起来，谁都会惊异他们的生产成绩是巨大的。这个队的麦田今年比去年增加了7.67％，但总产量却增加了137.7％，平均亩产量增长了120.8％。小麦产量翻了一番！这个变化实在令人兴奋。生长在这里的人民，知道自己的过去，所以他们最了解这个变化的意义。
    张村集生产大队的麦地靠近漳河北岸。过去常闹水，许多耕地碱化了。每年播下种，苗子难得保住六、七成，人们也就不愿再下功夫去管理了。近几年来，在党的领导下，修建了漳河大堤，也改进了耕作技术，小麦产量逐年有了增长：1957年平均亩产由过去的几十斤提高到一百一十斤；去年，又有增加；今年增产一倍，是特大的跃进。
    在凉爽的夏夜里，我和一些社员、干部在打麦场上谈起丰收的经验。公社的领导、各队的协作、人们的干劲、八字宪法……，他们都津津有味地谈到了。这些，是全省小麦今年丰收的共同经验。话拉长了，也谈到他们在夺取今年小麦丰收的斗争中的曲折和教训。只是由于他们能当机立断，下定决心，才扭转了局面，获得了大面积增产。
    这个曲折是这样的：去年种麦前，由于建立了人民公社，有了生产大跃进的经验，大家对迅速改善这儿的面貌，变低产为高产，决心很大。小麦翻一番的指标，就是在这种情况下订出来的。在讨论的时候，有人举出西南街生产队试验田的小麦，亩产曾达到八百多斤；申村生产队的谷子试验田，亩产达到了一千斤。大家认为，要多收，就得设法在一亩地里拿到尽可能多的粮食。这是争取多收的方向。方向定了，大家就下定决心大搞丰产方。
    在计划种麦的九千二百多亩田里，选择了一千五百亩有自流灌溉的好地。指定三十二个生产小队精心经营。这片地深翻了，底肥每亩施了七千多斤，所有渠道都作了修整，三十多眼旧井都锥了，另外还打了三眼机井。真是作到了土好、肥多、渠井灌溉双保险。播种是密植，每亩下种二十五斤至三十斤，都是选用的良种。人们的兴趣和注意力都集中到丰产方上来了。为了加强丰产方的管理，总支书记张据同志挂了帅，还吸收五个生产队的队长参加，组成了丰产方指挥部；从三十二个生产小队里，抽调了一千多个青壮年组成了小麦专业队；并且采取了支部书记包片，生产小队长包块，每个劳力包几垅，从种到收，一包到底的管理制度。这还不算，每个专业队还组织了一个有技术员和青年、壮年、老农参加的技术研究组，专门研究改进小麦的管理技术。各专业队之间，开展了十天一检查，半月一评比的红旗竞赛。在越冬管理、返青、拔节、孕穗、灌浆等阶段中，人们对小麦真是侍弄得无微不至。专业队的小伙子们，风雪无阻，每天早晨挨户收集人尿，挑到丰产方里去。一千五百亩丰产麦，用人尿普灌了一遍。后来，每亩又追了三千多斤粗肥和二百斤土化肥；浇一水锄一遍，一个冬春，足足浇锄了四遍，有的达到五遍。
    清明节过后，全大队在作小麦检查、评比的时候，丰产方自然是位居上游了。可是，那些丰产方以外的大片麦田，有很多像是没娘的孩儿，又黄又瘦。这些麦田虽然也进行了深翻，下种量和丰产方不相上下，但是，它们的底肥少，追肥、浇水不足，也缺乏人去管理。见景生情，有些老农和队长，一边检查、评比，一边就嘀咕起来了：“这些麦子包屈了！看来，要少收了。”“现在要加把劲，还不晚。”这些话提醒总支书记张据，他马上发动各生产小队，对方外大面积麦田分类排队。这样就看出问题来了：七千七百六十亩方外麦田中生长较好的一类麦只有二千一百二十亩，比较黄弱的二类麦三千六百亩，三类麦有二千零四十亩。按照当时情况，各类麦田的最高平均产量是一百五十斤、一百二十斤和八十斤。如果不加补救，即使丰产方高产多收了，总产量指标也是不能完成的。
    经过总支委员会讨论后，这个大队召开了生产队长和青年、壮年和老农积极分子会议，让大家出主意。总支书记张据向大家报告了一笔账：全大队的小麦，丰产方只占麦田总面积的16.19％；方外麦田占了33.8％。尽管丰产方丰产了，方外麦减产了，增产计划也会落空。只要看到了问题，谁的口袋里都能掏出办法来。经过一番商量，决定首先补肥、加水，还提出“三类赶二类，二类赶一类，一类赶上丰产方”和“十天一评比，月底比升级”的动员口号。
    口号和办法一提出，整个大队就掀起了大面积麦田的升级管理高潮。结合春季卫生运动，搞了个积肥运动，用拆（拆旧炕、旧墙等）、挖（挖粪坑、厕所、猪、羊、牛圈等）、净（屋净、院净、街净）等多种办法，共积肥二万三千多车，平均每亩追肥三车，有的达到了四车或五车。几十个土化肥厂，十多天就造出土化肥五十多万斤，每亩上了百余斤。在一些难以浇水的麦田里，社员们挖了三十多眼透渠井，缺水的麦田得到了灌溉。有些生产队，对于特别瘦弱的三类苗，每亩还偏施了十斤肥田粉。经过这番补救，麦田很快变了样，秸秆粗壮了，叶子绿中透黑。4月底评比时，各类麦田普遍升了级。原来的二、三类麦，除了因前期肥、水不足影响分蘖数少了一些以外，无论秸高、穗长，和丰产方的小麦比起来，真是不相上下。土地是不辜负人们的劳动的，经过这样的努力，丰产方以外的七千八百多亩小麦收打结果，平均每亩都比原来估产高了近一倍。
    张村集生产大队的小麦丰收了。这个大队的干部和社员还获得一条宝贵的经验。他们说：“高产还要多种才能多收粮”。
