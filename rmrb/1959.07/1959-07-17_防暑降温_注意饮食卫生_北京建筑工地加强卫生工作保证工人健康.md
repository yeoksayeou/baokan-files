Heatstroke Prevention and Cooling, Attention to Food Hygiene
Beijing Construction Sites Strengthen Sanitation Work to Ensure Workers' Health

(Our Newspaper dispatch) Reporter Liu Peiheng reports: In the height of summer, construction sites in the capital are vigorously strengthening sanitation work to ensure the health of construction workers and the smooth completion of construction tasks.

According to the specific conditions of the construction sites and the seasonal characteristics, all construction sites have universally focused on the important aspect of food hygiene to do a good job in disease prevention. The engineering administrative departments on the construction sites have conducted physical examinations of cooks and canteen staff, with health assessments made by hospitals or health stations. People with infectious diseases have been transferred to other jobs. Medical personnel at many construction sites explained hygiene knowledge to the cooks by having them observe the bacteria-carrying situation of flies under a microscope, making them understand the importance of doing a good job in food hygiene. The canteens of many construction sites have further improved their hygiene systems, improved food handling, and strengthened food disinfection, storage, and the personal hygiene of employees. Some canteen construction sites belonging to the Second and Fifth Construction Companies not only strictly separate the knives and cutting boards for cutting raw and cooked foods, but also store raw and cooked foods separately. In order to ensure the preservation and cleanliness of various foods, a food inspection system has also been established. Some canteens have health station medical personnel inspect and approve the sale of staple and non-staple foods half an hour before each meal every day.

In order to promote the development of sanitation work on the construction sites, many construction site command departments have also included "good sanitation" as an indicator in the red banner competition on the construction sites. Through various forms of publicity such as big-character posters, blackboards, cartoons, and broadcasts, workers have come to realize the significance of doing a good job in summer environmental sanitation to ensure good health in order to better complete construction tasks, and various sanitation systems have been established. Some workers' dormitories on some construction sites have added fly-proofing equipment and vents, and special personnel are on duty every day to clean them. Some workers' sheds are cleaned spotlessly, and each group is allocated to the same dormitory as much as possible according to the labor organization, in order to maintain the quietness of the dormitory and ensure that the workers can sleep well. At the construction site of the First Engineering Office of the Third Construction Company, the workers' dormitories are often kept clean, and the quilts are frequently taken apart and washed. Many workers have developed good hygiene habits, taking a bath every week, washing their face and feet before going to bed every day, and ensuring indoor air circulation. The workers said: "Good hygiene not only prevents diseases, but also makes sleeping comfortable!"

Attention has also been paid to heatstroke prevention and cooling on the construction sites. Many construction sites have increased the number of water-boiling and water-delivery workers, and increased the number of drinking water stations. At the same time, working hours have been changed to avoid working during the hot hours of noon. The First, Third, Fifth Construction Engineering Companies, and the Joint State-Private Construction Engineering Company, conducted health check-ups on more than 2,000 workers working in open-air high-altitude and high-temperature environments, and adjusted the labor organization for those found to have high blood pressure, heart disease, or other conditions unsuitable for working at high altitudes and temperatures. Some high-temperature workshops in processing plants are being renovated and equipped with mechanical ventilation and heat insulation and cooling measures.

While actively carrying out prevention work, the construction sites also promptly isolate, disinfect, and treat sick employees to control the source of infection and prevent the spread of disease. The Seventh Engineering Office of the Second Construction Engineering Company put forward the slogan: "Early detection, early treatment." Medical personnel took the initiative to go to the teams to conduct visits and provide medical care. Isolation rooms and special toilets for patients were set up, and the patients' tableware and utensils were disinfected. In June, the office discovered two dysentery patients. Because the treatment was timely and the isolation work was done well, the spread of the disease was effectively controlled, ensuring that the attendance rate in the second quarter of this year remained above 98%, and guaranteeing that the construction tasks of the second quarter were overfulfilled by 28.1%.

    防暑降温　注意饮食卫生
    北京建筑工地加强卫生工作保证工人健康
    本报讯　记者刘佩珩报道：在盛夏季节，首都各建筑工地大力加强卫生工作，保证建筑工人的健康，顺利完成建设任务。
    各建筑工地根据工地情况及季节性的特点，普遍地抓住了饮食卫生这个重要环节，作好防病工作。工地上的工程行政部门对炊事员、食堂工作人员普遍地进行了身体检查，由医院或保健站作出健康鉴定，患有传染疾病的人都调换了工作。许多工地的医务人员通过让炊事人员用显微镜观察苍蝇带菌的情况等办法，对他们讲解卫生知识，使他们懂得搞好饮食卫生的重要意义。许多建筑工地的食堂进一步健全了卫生制度，改进食品的操作，加强食品消毒、保管和从业人员的个人卫生。第二、第五建筑公司的一些工地食堂，不仅把切生熟食品的刀、案严格分开，连生、熟食物也分开储存保管。为作好各种食品的防腐保洁，还建立了食品验收制度。有的食堂在每天每顿饭前半小时，由保健站医务人员检查验售主副食。
    许多工地指挥部门为了推动工地卫生工作的开展，把“卫生好”也列入工地红旗竞赛的一项指标。通过大字报、黑板报、漫画和广播等多种多样形式的宣传，使职工们认识到搞好夏季环境卫生保证身体健康才能很好地完成建设任务的意义，建立了各种卫生制度。有些工地的职工宿舍，增设了防蝇设备和通气孔，每天有专人值勤清扫。有些工棚室内打扫的干干净净，并且按劳动组织，每组尽量分配在同一宿舍，以保持宿舍的安静和保证工人能睡得好。第三建筑公司第一工程处的工地，工人宿舍经常保持清洁，被子经常拆洗。许多工人已养成良好卫生习惯，做到每周洗澡，每天睡觉前洗脸、洗脚，室内空气流通。工人们说：“卫生好，不光预防疾病，睡觉也舒服！”
    工地上还注意了防暑降温工作，许多施工现场增加了烧水和送水工人，增多了饮水站。同时，改变了作息时间，避免和错开在中午炎热时间内进行工作。第一、三、五建筑工程公司和公私合营建筑工程公司，对二千多名在露天高空、高温环境作业的工人进行了健康检查，发现有患高血压、心脏病等不适于在高空高温工作的人，即进行调整劳动组织。对加工厂的一些高温车间，并着手改装和设置机械通风以及采用隔热降温等措施。
    在积极开展预防工作的同时，工地对于发病的职工，也及时的进行隔离、消毒和治疗，以控制传染源，防止疾病的传播。第二建筑工程公司第七工程处提出口号：“早发现、早治疗”，医务人员主动下队进行访问和医疗。并设有隔离房间，病人专用厕所，对病人食具用具进行消毒。该处在6月份发现了两名痢疾病人，因为治疗及时，隔离工作做得好，就有效地控制住疾病的传播，保证了今年第二季度的出勤率经常保持在98％以上，保证超额28.1％完成了第二季度的建设任务。（附图片）
    北京市第一建筑工程公司第四指挥部的工地食堂，卫生工作作得好，保证了工人的健康，使工程任务能如期完成。这个食堂自一月到现在连续六个月受到公司的奖励，被评为红旗食堂。图为工地保健站的医生王耀昌（左）在检查蔬菜是否新鲜新华社记者  纳一摄
