The first thing people ask about scientific research achievements is: what is the level? Can it be promoted and applied immediately?

This is a question that should be asked, and that scientific workers are willing to answer. To answer such a question, the only way is to adopt scientific appraisal methods.

The Science and Technology Commissions of Hebei Province and Tianjin Municipality have appraised the quality of some scientific research achievements and determined a number of scientific research achievements that can be promoted and applied. This is such an exciting thing for every scientific worker. All scientific creations, if not subjected to scientific appraisal, are only half of the work done, even if there are research results.

The purpose of conducting scientific and technological research is to apply research results to production practice. If we only know that there is a research result, but do not know the quality of this result, whether it is good or bad, what are its advantages, what problems are there, what are the economic benefits, etc., scientific research units cannot recommend it to production departments, and production departments, although eager to innovate technology, do not dare to accept and promote it lightly. This problem can also be solved through scientific appraisal.

For scientific workers, if they only have a general understanding of the results of a research project, they cannot decide on the next step of the work, whether to continue this work or to do another work based on this work. This problem can also be solved through scientific appraisal. If the appraisal points out that there are still some problems to be solved in a certain research project, the people doing this work will know the direction of their efforts and continue to research in order to improve it. This promotes the development of research work.

Appraisal can also enrich the content of academic activities. The entire process of an appraisal is a practical academic activity. During the appraisal, different opinions on a certain issue can be debated and resolved. Scientific workers and relevant departments participating in the appraisal can also exchange experiences, understand each other's situations, and benefit the work. At the same time, it can also promote the sorting and accumulation of technical data.

Appraisal is a laborious and time-consuming task. However, labor and time can avoid losses in research work, can bring benefits to research work, and can make research results better serve the national construction cause. Labor and time are necessary and are the price that should be paid. Some people worry that emphasizing appraisal will bind the hands and feet of young scientific workers and hinder their enthusiasm. In fact, it will not. To do a good job and to get rigorous training from work is the wish of young scientific workers. As long as they understand the significance of appraisal, their enthusiasm will only increase and will not be restricted.

Appraisal is an indispensable link in scientific research work and should be institutionalized. Scientific research departments should gradually promote this work, strive to gain experience, and promote scientific research work to move forward better.

    让鉴定形成制度
    金文
    一提起科学研究成果，人们首先要问：水平如何？能不能马上推广应用？
    这是应该问的，也是科学工作者愿意回答的问题。要回答这样的问题，只有采取科学鉴定的办法。
    河北省和天津市的科学技术委员会鉴定了一些科学研究成果的质量，确定了可以推广应用的若干科学研究成果。这对每个科学工作者是多么值得兴奋的事。一切科学创造，如果不经过科学的鉴定，即使有了研究成果，也只是作了工作的一半。
    进行科学技术研究的目的，是要把研究成果用之于生产实践。如果我们只知道有了一项研究成果，不知道这项成果的质量，它好还是不好，好在什么地方，还有什么问题，经济效益如何等等，科学研究单位无法向生产部门推荐，生产部门虽然急待革新技术，也不敢轻于接受推广。经过科学的鉴定，这个问题也就可以解决。
    对于科学工作者来说，一项研究的结果，本人如果还只是了解个大概情况，这就无法决定下一步的工作，是继续做这项工作呢，还是在这项工作的基础上去做另一项工作。经过科学的鉴定，也就可以解决这一问题。如果鉴定指出，某项研究还有某些问题需要解决，做这工作的人就知道了努力的方向，继续研究，以求完善。这就促进了研究工作的发展。
    鉴定还能够丰富学术活动的内容。一次鉴定的整个过程，就是一次实实在在的学术活动。在鉴定中，对某一问题的不同意见，可以展开争辩，求得解决。参加鉴定的科学工作者和有关部门，还可以在鉴定中交流经验，互相了解情况，有利于工作。同时，还可以促进技术资料的整理和积累。
    鉴定是费力费时的事。可是，费力费时可以使研究工作避免损失，可以给研究工作带来好处，可以使研究成果很好地为国家建设事业服务。费力费时是必要的，是应该付出的代价。有的人耽心，强调鉴定，是否会束缚住青年科学工作者的手脚，妨碍他们的积极性。实际是不会的。要把工作做好，要从工作中得到严格的锻炼，本是青年科学工作者的愿望。只要让他们理解鉴定的意义，他们的积极性只会提高，不会受到束缚。
    鉴定是科学研究工作中不可少的环节，应该形成制度。科学研究部门应该逐步推行这一工作，努力取得经验，促使科学研究工作更好地前进。
