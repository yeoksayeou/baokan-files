    Mongolia's Education Undertakings
    Before the victory of the People's Revolution in 1921, Mongolia's cultural and educational undertakings were backward. At that time, there was only one primary school for the sons of feudal princes, with 40 students. On average, only three to five out of every thousand residents were literate. Now, with the development of Mongolia's socialist construction, great achievements have been made in cultural and educational undertakings. There are no more illiterate adults in the country. At present, there are more than 400 schools nationwide, all offering free education. Students in technical schools and universities also receive scholarships. According to materials published by the Mongolian government: Currently, one in every six people is studying; for every 10,000 residents, there are 1,100 primary and secondary school students, 77 secondary specialized school students, and 62 university students. The number of people studying in universities exceeds the proportion of university students in the national population of countries such as Italy and Turkey.
    Compared with 1947 (the year before the first five-year plan), the number of people with higher education in Mongolia increased by 6.8 times in 1958, including a 24-fold increase in doctors, a 7.5-fold increase in agricultural experts, and a 12-fold increase in economists; the number of specialized personnel with secondary specialized education increased by two times. In order to further improve the cultural and educational undertakings of the Mongolian people, during the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960), Mongolia decided to gradually popularize seven-year education in larger cities. By 1960, the number of students in general schools will increase by 8.8% compared to 1957, and the number of university students will increase by 31.5%. The number of cultural palaces and clubs will be increased in the provinces to meet the cultural life needs of the people. (From Germany)

    蒙古的教育事业
    在1921年人民革命胜利以前，蒙古的文化教育事业是落后的，那时全蒙古只有一所为封建王公子弟设立的小学，学生四十人；每一千居民中平均只有三到五人识字。而现
  在，随着蒙古社会主义建设事业的发展，文化教育事业已取得很大成就，全国成人中已经没有文盲了，目前全国共有四百多所学校，全部实行免费教育，在技术学校和高等学校读书的学生还享受助学金。根据蒙古政府公布的材料：现在每六个人中就有一人在学习；每一万居民中就有一千一百个中小学生，七十七个中等专科学校学生，六十二个高等学校的学生。在高等学校里学习的人数超过了意大利、土耳其等国家高等学校学生人数在全国人口中所占的比例。
    以1958年同1947年（第一个五年计划前一年）相比，蒙古受过高等教育的人数增加了六点八倍，其中医生增加了二十四倍，农业专家增加了七点五倍，经济学家增加了十二倍；而受过中等专业教育的专门人材增加了两倍。为了进一步提高蒙古人民的文化教育事业，在三年计划（1958—1960年）期间，蒙古决定将在较大的城市逐步普及七年制教育，到1960年普通学校学生将比1957年增加8.8％，高等学校学生将增加31.5％。在各省将要增加文化宫、俱乐部的数目，以满足人民的文化生活需要。　（德）
