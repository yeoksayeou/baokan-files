Xinhua News Agency Reports: In the lead-up to "Vietnam Day" on July 20th, people's organizations and media outlets in many countries have been sending telegrams to the Vietnamese people or publishing commentaries, supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle for peaceful reunification of their homeland and condemning the crimes committed by the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam, which threaten peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

    The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" published an editorial on the 19th, stating that South Vietnam is being transformed by American imperialism into a base, equipped with modern weapons, to oppose the people of peace-loving countries in Southeast Asia. The editorial, commemorating the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords, pointed out that "revenge for the failure at Geneva" is the foundation of Washington's Asian policy. The machinery of retaliation they have set in motion is operating in precisely this manner.
    "Izvestia" concluded by emphasizing that the Soviet people assure their distant brothers of their firm support in their heroic struggle for the implementation of the Geneva Accords, for peaceful reunification, freedom, and independence of Vietnam.

    The Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, stating that the working people of Czechoslovakia have great sympathy for the Vietnamese people's struggle to unify their homeland on a peaceful and democratic basis, as well as their struggle to force the withdrawal of American troops from South Vietnam and to uphold the international agreements on Vietnam, and will give their full support.

    "Democratic Korea" published an editorial stating that the Korean people, on the occasion of "Vietnam Day," further express their support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and their internationalist solidarity with the Vietnamese people, and angrily condemn the common enemy of the peoples of both countries—American imperialists. The editorial pointed out that "Driving out American imperialists from South Korea and South Vietnam is the common task of the peoples of both countries. Our struggle against American imperialism is supported by peace-loving people all over the world."

    The Mongolian newspaper "Unen" published an editorial on the 19th, supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to achieve peaceful reunification of their homeland on a democratic basis. The editorial emphasized that the Mongolian people resolutely condemn the reactionary regime in South Vietnam, which has become an accomplice of American imperialism, and are fully confident that the Vietnamese people will achieve new and greater victories in their struggle for independence and the establishment of a democratic and unified country.

    The Hungarian newspaper "Népszabadság" published an article exposing the crimes of the South Vietnamese authorities, the Lao government, and American imperialism in violating the Geneva Accords, and supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle for the reunification of their homeland. The article stated that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China have repeatedly requested the Chairmen of the Geneva Conference to immediately investigate the actual situation and take effective measures regarding the serious situation in Indochina. The article pointed out that on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords, progressive people around the world are working to promote the true realization of the Geneva Accords.

    The Burmese World Peace Committee issued a statement on "Vietnam Day" on the 18th, demanding the withdrawal of American military personnel from South Vietnam, the dismantling of American military bases in South Vietnam, and expressing support for consultations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the South Vietnamese authorities on the issue of holding free general elections. The statement condemned the South Vietnamese authorities for violating the Geneva Accords. The statement said that because of American imperialist interference in South Vietnam, Vietnam remains divided into two parts, and peace in Southeast Asia is adversely affected.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在7月20日“越南日”前夕，许多国家的人民团体和舆论，纷纷打电报给越南人民或发表评论，支持越南人民争取和平统一祖国的斗争并谴责美国和吴庭艳集团在南越进行的威胁东南亚和世界和平的罪行。
    苏联“消息报”19日发表社论说，南越正在变为美帝国主义的用现代武器装备起来的反对东南亚爱好和平国家人民的基地。社论在庆祝日内瓦协议签订五周年时指出，“报复在日内瓦的失败”——这便是华盛顿外交家们在亚洲政策的基础。他们所开动的报复活动的机器也正是这样行事的。
      “消息报”最后强调指出，苏联人民向他们远方的兄弟保证，坚决支持他们，在争取履行日内瓦协议，争取和平统一、自由和越南的独立而进行的英勇斗争。
    捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会打电报给越南总工会说，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民对越南人民争取在和平、民主的基础上统一祖国的斗争，以及他们为使美军撤出南越和维护关于越南的国际协议所作的斗争，怀有极大的同情，并将全力予以支持。
    “民主朝鲜报”发表社论说，朝鲜人民在“越南日”到来的时候，进一步表示对越南人民正义斗争的支持和同越南人民的国际主义团结，并且愤怒地谴责朝越两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义者。社论指出，“从南朝鲜和南越赶出美帝国主义者，是朝越两国人民的共同任务。我们反对美帝国主义的斗争受到全世界爱好和平人民的支援。”
    蒙古“真理报”19日发表社论，支持越南人民在民主基础上争取和平统一祖国的正义斗争。社论强调指出，蒙古人民坚决谴责成为美帝国主义帮凶的南越的反动制度，并且完全相信越南人民将在争取独立、建立民主统一的国家的斗争中取得新的更大的胜利。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”发表文章，揭露南越当局和老挝政府及美帝国主义违反日内瓦协议的罪行，并支持越南人民为统一祖国而进行的斗争。文章说，越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国曾经就印度支那的严重形势多次向日内瓦会议主席提出请求，要求他们立即调查实际情况并采取有效措施。文章指出，在纪念日内瓦协议签订五周年之际，世界各地的进步人士都在为促使日内瓦协议的真正实现而努力。
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会18日就“越南日”发表声明，要求美国军事人员撤出南越，取消美国在南越的军事基地，并且表示支持越南民主共和国同南越当局就举行自由普选问题举行协商。声明谴责南越当局破坏日内瓦协议。声明说，由于美帝国主义者在南越进行干涉，越南仍然分裂为两部分，东南亚的和平因而受到不利的影响。
