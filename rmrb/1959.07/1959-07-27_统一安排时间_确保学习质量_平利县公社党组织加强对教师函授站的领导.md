This newspaper reports: How to run correspondence stations well and improve the level of elementary school teachers? Pingli County, Shaanxi Province, provides very good experience.

Currently, there are twenty-seven correspondence stations in the county with three hundred and eighty-six students. Teachers whose original level was below that of normal school and junior normal school have all participated in the study. However, some teachers have a low political and professional level and a poor foundation, and cannot catch up with their studies for a while. Some study hard day and night, but the effect is still not great, so they feel distressed and even uneasy about their teaching work. In response to this situation, the County Party Committee decided to list the work of training and improving elementary school teachers as an important task in education. Then, after summarizing the experience and lessons learned from the past, where the correspondence education was not relying on the masses and the progress was not great, after the school started this year, it immediately issued instructions calling on all teachers in the county to: "Run the stations themselves, study themselves, teach each other, learn from each other, those who are capable can be teachers, supervise each other, and everyone checks."

The Party Committees of each commune have taken up this work, with the secretaries personally taking charge, strengthening political and ideological education, and addressing the ideological concerns of some older teachers who think that "they are too old to achieve anything," and young teachers who only want to leave for further studies, thinking that participating in correspondence studies is of little benefit, by giving mobilization reports to the teachers. They also organized the school teachers to study the relevant instructions of the central and provincial Party and government leaders for a week, discussing the matter on its merits, and invited teachers with successful on-the-job specialization experience to introduce their experiences.

In terms of organization, each commune implemented a "six fixed" system (fixed instructor, students, location, time, task, and quality). Learning groups were formed by school or region. In order to ensure that teaching and learning were not delayed, the commune made unified arrangements for the political current affairs and professional cultural learning time of each school, fixing it, and it was not allowed to be changed or occupied without the approval of the Commune Party Committee. The County Party Committee also adopted the measures of "strengthening guidance and regular inspections" to ensure the quality of learning at the correspondence stations.

After half a year of unremitting efforts, the correspondence stations have played their due role. The political and professional level of the teachers participating in the study has greatly improved. Of the nine teachers in Liangxi Elementary School, seven originally applied for transfer, mainly because their professional level was low, their teaching performance was poor, and the masses had opinions, so they felt "in a difficult situation." After half a year of correspondence study, everyone clarified the Party's education policy and the glory of the people's teachers, and their professional ability and teaching quality have been significantly improved, thus increasing their confidence in their work and receiving praise from the masses. In Longmen Management District of Baxian Commune, six teachers had a junior high school dropout level and could not prepare lessons. After studying, especially after studying texts such as "Experiences of Elementary School Teachers," these teachers have improved their professional level to varying degrees. At present, the six teachers who could not prepare lessons have basically been able to distinguish and grasp the nature and genre of the text. More than 90% of the teachers in the county have played a leading role in lecturing, guiding homework, grading papers, exams, and answering difficult questions. In this semester, the vast majority of students at all levels of schools can progress in an orderly manner, improving the quality of teaching.

### 统一安排时间　确保学习质量  平利县公社党组织加强对教师函授站的领导

    统一安排时间　确保学习质量
    平利县公社党组织加强对教师函授站的领导
    本报讯　怎样把函授站办好，提高小学教师的水平，陕西省平利县提供了很好的经验。
    目前，全县共有函授站二十七个，学员三百八十六名，原来程度不及师范和初师的教师都参加了学习。但是，有些教师政治业务水平不高，基础差，学习一时赶不上去；有的夜以继日苦学钻研，但效果仍然不大，因而感到苦恼，甚至不安心教师工作。县委针对这种情况，决定把培养提高小学教师工作列为教育工作中的一项重要任务。接着，总结了过去办函授教育中没有依靠群众、进展不大的经验教训，在今年开学后，即发布指示，号召全县教师
  “自己办站，自己学习，互教互学，能者为师，互相监督，大家检查。”
    各公社党委都把这一工作抓了起来，书记亲自挂帅，加强政治思想教育，针对一些老年教师中认为“年龄大了，学不出个名堂”，年轻教师只想离职深造，认为参加函授学习收效不大等思想顾虑，给教师作动员报告。还以一周时间组织学校教师学习了中央和省级党政领导的有关指示，就实论虚，并请在职专修有成绩的老师介绍经验。
    在组织方面，各公社实行了
  “六固定”（固定辅导员、学员、地点、时间、任务、质量）制度。并以学校或地区为单位，组成学习小组。为了保证教学和学习两不误，公社将各学校的政治时事、业务文化学习时间作了统一安排，固定起来，非经公社党委批准不得随便更改或侵占学习时间。县委还采取了“加强辅导、定期检查”的措施，以保证函授站学习的质量。
    经过半年来的不懈努力，函授站已发挥了应有的效用。参加学习的教师的政治业务水平都有很大提高。梁溪小学的九个教师，原来有七个申请转业，主要原因是业务水平低，教学成绩不好，群众有意见，因而他们感到“处境困难”。经过半年的函授学习，大家明确了党的教育方针和人民教师的光荣，业务能力和教学质量都有显著提高，因而工作信心增强，得到群众好评。八仙公社龙门管区有六名教师是初中肄业水平，不会备课。这些教师在学习后，特别是学习了“小学教师经验谈”等课文后，业务水平都有不同程度提高。目前，六名不会备课的教师，已基本能够辨清和掌握课文的性质和体裁。全县90％以上的教师在讲课、指导作业、改卷子、考试、解答疑难问题等方面，都发挥了主导作用，本学期各级学校学生绝大多数都能循序上进，提高了教学质量。
