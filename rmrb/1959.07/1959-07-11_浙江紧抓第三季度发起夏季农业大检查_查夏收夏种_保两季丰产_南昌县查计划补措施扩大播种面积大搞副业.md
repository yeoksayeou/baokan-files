From our Hangzhou dispatch of the 10th: Zhejiang Province is starting a summer agricultural production inspection centered on the summer harvest and summer planting. Personnel from provincial agencies participating in the province-wide summer agricultural production inspection team are being dispatched to various locations.

The Zhejiang Province Summer Agricultural Production Inspection Team is headed by Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Huo Shilien, Lin Hujia, Cao Xiangren, and Chen Weida, Secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, serving as heads of various sub-teams. A large number of cadres from provincial agencies have joined the inspection team.

Before the start of the summer agricultural production inspection, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice on organizing a province-wide summer agricultural production inspection, outlining the key points of this inspection. The notice pointed out: July and August are decisive periods for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest for the entire year. All counties in the province should conduct a comprehensive agricultural production inspection centered on the summer harvest and summer planting before the harvesting of early and mid-season rice. The main content of this inspection is primarily the summer harvest and summer planting. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that the characteristics of this year's summer harvest and summer planting are: the density of early rice planting is higher than last year, and the area of continuous cropping of late rice and other late autumn crops has expanded. Therefore, labor is particularly strained and preparations must be made early through inspection. Efforts should be made to ensure meticulous harvesting and threshing, timely planting, implementation of planning, adequate tools, and good labor arrangements, and to prepare for unexpected disasters.

Regarding the summer harvest and summer planting, the Provincial Party Committee's notice called for inspecting the summer harvest and summer planting plans of counties, communes, and production teams; inspecting fertilizer accumulation; inspecting how to solve labor problems and improve labor efficiency; and inspecting ideological and political work during the summer harvest and summer planting.

Secondly, it is necessary to inspect production guidelines and production plans. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that it is necessary to inspect the agricultural production guidelines and the issue of overall balance, study and resolve the relationship between agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, especially the relationship between grain and animal husbandry. It is necessary to inspect the problems in the implementation of this year's plan and study and formulate various plans and production plans for next year.

In addition to the above two issues, the Provincial Party Committee's notice pointed out that it is also necessary to inspect current market issues, rectification of communes, and industrial issues.

From our Nanchang dispatch of the 10th: Half the year has passed, how is the production plan being implemented? Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, has launched a mass campaign to comprehensively check plans and supplement measures.

This spring, the Nanchang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on favorable conditions in all aspects, formulated a production plan to vigorously develop agricultural and sideline occupations and strive for a net income exceeding 100 yuan per person throughout the county. However, as of the end of June, the income from sideline occupations, cash crops, industry, and early rice estimated by various communes and production teams only accounted for 49.34% of the annual income plan. In response to this situation, the County Party Committee put forward the slogan "Make up for the shortfall in early rice with late rice, and make up for the shortfall last year with this year," and required all communes in the county to check plans and supplement measures, making every effort to fight the battle in the second half of the year. The County Party Committee required that the area planted with late rice throughout the county be expanded to 850,000 mu, sesame be planted on 100,000 mu, 300,000 pigs and 400,000 ducks be raised, 100,000 dan of aquatic products be produced, and that the existing 32,000 mu of cotton be guaranteed to produce more than 50 jin per mu. The 10,000 mu of vegetables already planted are required to complete an income of 150 yuan per mu. After this plan is realized, coupled with the income from production team and commune member household sideline occupations, the income per person can completely reach or exceed 100 yuan. Subsequently, a campaign to check plans and supplement measures was launched in all communes throughout the county.

The Fushan Commune Party Committee, during its inspection, proposed to find ways to increase production from three aspects: harvesting early rice well, expanding the area of late rice, and vigorously developing non-staple food production, based on the requirements of comprehensive development of production. It also helped the Yushatang Village production team, which had a relatively low income last year, to check and calculate the implementation of this year's plan. The calculation showed that the average net income per person could only reach 54 yuan. The Party branch immediately organized commune members to discuss ways to find measures. The Xiaolan Commune, in order to make up for the production shortfall in the first half of the year, asked for grain from open spaces and immediately organized personnel to open up more than 500 mu of wasteland to plant field bean, sweet potato, sesame and other crops. The Houfang Brigade of the Rengang Commune had poor natural conditions and did not carry out diversified operations well, resulting in low income. Now it has increased the breeding of 15 sows, 1,200 ducks, and 20,000 fish, and organized people who cannot engage in agricultural labor to engage in sideline production. After checking plans and supplementing measures, the Maqiu Commune has begun to show a new look of leaping forward in agricultural and sideline production: in addition to completing the planting area exceeding the plan, the number of pigs has increased to 24,000 and the number of poultry has reached 170,000.

    浙江紧抓第三季度发起夏季农业大检查
    查夏收夏种　保两季丰产
    南昌县查计划补措施扩大播种面积大搞副业
    晚稻85万亩  芝麻10万亩  棉花3万多亩  养猪30万头  鸭40万只  水产10万担蔬菜1万亩
    本报杭州10日电　浙江省各地开始进行以夏收夏种为中心内容的夏季农业生产大检查。省级机关参加全省夏季农业生产检查团的人员正陆续分赴各地。
    浙江省夏季农业生产检查团由中共浙江省委第一书记江华担任团长，省委书记处书记霍士廉、林乎加、曹祥仁、陈伟达都担任各分团团长。省级机关大批干部参加了检查团。
    在开始夏季农业生产检查前，中共浙江省委发出了关于组织全省夏季农业生产大检查的通知，提出了这次检查的要点。通知指出：7、8月份是争取全年农业大丰收具有决定性的时期，全省各县应当在早中稻收割以前，普遍地进行一次以夏收夏种为中心内容的农业生产大检查。这次检查的主要内容，首先是夏收夏种问题。省委指出：今年夏收夏种的特点是：早稻密植程度比去年高，连作晚稻和其他晚秋作物面积扩大，因此，劳力显得特别紧张，必须通过检查，及早作好准备。要求做到细收细打、及时插种、规划落实、工具齐备、劳力安排好，并且要准备应付意外灾害。
    在夏收夏种方面，省委通知中提出要检查县、公社、生产队的夏收夏种规划；检查积肥情况；检查如何解决劳力问题，提高劳动效率；检查夏收夏种中的思想政治工作。
    其次是检查生产方针和生产规划问题。省委指出应检查农业生产的方针问题和综合平衡问题，研究解决农、林、牧、副、渔各项生产之间的关系，特别是粮食和畜牧业之间的关系。要检查今年执行计划中的问题，研究和制订各种规划和明年生产规划。
    除了上述两个问题外，省委通知指出还要检查当前市场问题，整社问题，工业问题。
    本报南昌10日电　一年已过去了一半，生产计划执行得如何？江西省南昌县开展了一场群众性的全面查计划、补措施运动。
    今年春天，中共南昌县委根据各方面的有利条件，制订出大力发展农副业，争取全县每人纯收入超过百元的生产计划。但是从6月底的情况来看，各公社生产队的副业、经济作物、工业和早稻的估产收入，只完成全年收入计划的49.34％。针对这一情况，县委提出了“早稻不足晚稻补，上年不足下年补”的口号，要求全县各公社查计划、补措施，尽一切努力打好下半年这一仗。县委要求全县晚稻栽种面积扩大到八十五万亩，芝麻播种十万亩，饲养生猪三十万头、鸭四十万只、水产十万担，保证现有三万二千亩棉花亩产五十斤以上，已种植的万亩蔬菜，要求完成每亩一百五十元的收入。这个计划实现后，再加上生产队和社员家庭副业收入，每人收入就完全可以达到百元或超过百元。接着，一个查计划、补措施运动就在全县各公社展开了。
    富山公社党委在检查中，根据全面发展生产要求，提出从收好早稻、扩大晚稻面积、大搞副食品生产三方面来找增产措施。并帮助去年收入较少的玉沙唐村生产队，查算今年计划执行情况。查算结果，每人平均纯收入只能达到五十四元。党支部即组织社员开展想办法、找措施的讨论。小蓝公社为了弥补上半年生产不足，向空地要粮，立即组织人马，开出荒地五百多亩，种上了田塍豆、红薯、芝麻等作物。荏港公社后坊大队由于自然条件较差，多种经营开展得不够好，收入低，现在增养了十五头母猪，一千二百多只鸭，二万尾鱼，组织不能从事农业劳动的人搞副业生产。麻丘公社经过查计划、补措施之后，农、副业生产开始出现了跃进的新面貌：除了播种面积超计划完成以外，生猪发展到两万四千头；家禽达到十七万只。
