    They Fight Underground
    By our reporter Ma Ming
    We followed the winding mountain road to the Jiaozigou of the Xishan Coal Mine. Here, surrounded by mountains, black coal seams were exposed everywhere. On the long open-pit transportation line, winches, trams, and trains were running. The shiny, black prime coking coal flowed like mountain streams from the coal chute to the coal loading station, and then transported to Taiyuan Iron and Steel, Baotou Steel, and Wuhan Steel.
    From the pit entrance to the 2212 working face of the 62nd group, it is as far as 1,800 meters. The electric lights illuminate the way like a night market street. The busy mining scene here is fascinating. On this narrow, elongated working face of more than 540 cubic meters, coal miners are carrying out comprehensive parallel operations: Drilling and blasting workers holding electric drills, explosives, and detonators act as "pioneers." Combine driver Chen Tianyao and his assistant follow behind, driving a huge coal mining machine, slowly advancing along a long coal wall. The comb-like combine cutting chain bites into the hard coal seam, quickly separating large pieces of coal from the seam. Then, the coal dropping rod equipped with a crushing disc crushes the large pieces of coal and sends them into the loading machine. The loading machine sends them into the coal chute, and in this way, tons and tons of coal are transported out like flowing water. To ensure work safety and prevent roof collapse, dense supports and roof releasing work are also being carried out simultaneously.
    At this time, the sound of electric drills drilling coal, the sound of machines, and the sound of explosions echo in a symphony.
    In July last year, when the workers heard that mechanical coal mining was going to be used, they happily pulled the combine to the working face with fifteen flatbed trucks. However, how to skillfully operate and repair this huge machine? Even the production team leader and the three combine drivers did not understand. The result of the first month of use was that coal production did not increase but decreased instead. At that time, some people began to have a resistant attitude towards the combine: this thing is bulky, complicated, takes up a lot of space, and is disobedient. It is better to use the old method of coal mining with electric drills and blasting. When the combine went out of the pit for repairs, they only hoped to extend the repair time and not let it go down into the pit again.
    However, the growth of new technical forces quickly changed their mood. The following allegro reflects how profound their understanding of the combine has changed:
    The combine is a treasure,
    High yield and high efficiency;
    Saves physical strength, everyone laughs.
    In this narrow coal tunnel, twenty-seven-year-old mechanical and electrical repairman Lian Dingzhu, holding pliers in one hand and a screwdriver in the other, skillfully disassembled the traction part of a complex Donbass Type I combine, taking advantage of the momentary gap in coal mining. He replaced the worn screws, carefully inspected every linked part, and after troubleshooting, installed it, so that this combine quickly showed its power again.
    This man, who five years ago was still a bullock cart worker transporting coal underground, is now a fourth-grade worker loved by coal miners. He is often either repairing telecommunications equipment in the year-round sunless roadways, or helping to repair winches and electric drills and erect electric wires on the coal dust-filled recovery working face. In the past, not to mention repairing combines, he had never even heard of the word combine. In the past two years, he has not only basically mastered the performance and repair technology of various mechanical and telecommunications equipment underground, but also pays attention to technological innovation at all times.
    When the combine production was normal and coal mining increased, a weak link appeared in the underground transportation system. Lian Dingzhu squatted next to the motor reducer and the coal chute, carefully observed, and repeatedly thought, and found that the speed regulating reducer wheel was too small and had too few teeth, which was not compatible with the large wheel and many teeth on the coal chute. He and the mine's machine repair factory designed and cast new gears, and after adjusting the speed, it increased from the original 380 revolutions per minute to 450 revolutions per minute. The coal transportation capacity per hour also increased from 60 tons in the past to more than 100 tons. He saw that there was one person operating each coal chute, and there was very little to do. He believed that this was a waste of manpower. He and the veteran miners further studied and obtained the approval of the leaders to change to "centralized operation," abolish the coal chute management worker, and change the loader at the chute machine head to manage. In this way, one person's management can top the effectiveness of two people.
    At the pit entrance and underground, the many selfless labor and innovative technology model deeds of the 62nd group of coal miners tell people: an underground great army equipped with new technology is growing from all corners. (Attached picture)

    他们战斗在地下
    本报记者　马明
    我们沿着曲折的爬山公路来到西山煤矿茭子沟，这里，群山环绕，黑色煤层到处裸露在外边，在漫长的露天运输线上，绞车、电车、火车在奔跑，黑溜溜的主焦煤，像山间的溪水，从煤溜子运煤槽，汹涌地流向装煤站，运往太钢、包钢、武钢。
    从坑口到六十二组的二二一二工作面，足有一千八百米，一路电灯照耀得如同夜市街道。这里采煤的一片繁忙景象把人迷住了。在这个五百四十多立方米的狭长工作面上，采煤工人正在展开综合平行作业：手执电钻、火药、雷管的打眼放炮工，充当“开路先锋”。康拜因司机陈天耀和他的助手跟在后面，驾驶着一台庞大的采煤机器，沿着一道长长的煤壁徐徐前进。好像锯齿似的康拜因截链，啃入坚硬的煤层，把一块块大煤，迅速地和煤层分开。接着装有粉碎盘的落煤杆，又把大块煤破碎，送入装煤机。装煤机把它们送进煤溜子，就这样成吨成吨的煤像流水一样被输送出去。为保证工作安全、防止顶板塌落，密集支柱和放顶工作，也在交叉进行。
    这时，电钻钻煤的突突声，机器声和爆破声，交响呼应。
    去年7月，工人们听说要使用机械采煤了，高兴地用十五辆平车把康拜因拉到工作面。可是，究竟怎样熟练地操纵、检修这个庞大的机器？连生产组长、三个康拜因司机也闹不清楚。头一个月使用结果，煤产量没有增加反而下降了。当时有人对康拜因开始产生抵触情绪：这家伙，笨重、复杂、占地大，又不听话，还不如使用电钻、爆破的旧法采煤有把握。到康拜因出坑检修的时候，只盼望延长检修时间，不让它再下坑来。
    可是新的技术力量的成长，很快就改变了他们的情绪。下面一首快板，反映了他们对康拜因的认识转变是多么的深刻：
    康拜因就是宝，
    产量大工效高；
    省体力人人笑。
    在这个狭长的煤洞里，二十七岁的机电检修工连顶柱一手拿着钳子，一手拿着改锥，利用采煤的一刹那空隙，熟练地把一台构造复杂的顿巴斯一型康拜因的牵引部分拆开，他更换了被耗损的螺丝，细心地察看了每一处联动的地方，在排除了故障之后，把它安装起来，使这部康拜因很快又显示出它的威力来。
    这个五年以前还是坑下运煤的赶牛车工，如今已经是采煤工人所喜爱的四级工人了。他常常不是在终年不见阳光的巷道里检修电讯设备，便是在煤尘飞扬的回采工作面，帮助修理绞车、电钻、架设电线。过去不要说是检修康拜因，连康拜因三个字也没听说过。最近两年来，他不仅基本上掌握了坑下各种机械、电讯设备的性能和检修技术，而且时时刻刻注意技术革新。
    当康拜因生产正常，采煤增多以后，坑下运输系统出现了薄弱环节。连顶柱便蹲在电动机减速器和煤溜子的旁边，细心观察，反复思考，发现调节速度的减速器轮子太小、轮齿又少，同煤溜子上的轮大、轮齿多的情况不相适应。他和矿部机修厂设计铸造了新的齿轮、调节速度以后，每分钟便由原来的三百八十转增加到四百五十转。每小时的运煤能力也由过去的六十吨，提高到一百多吨。他看到每部煤溜子都有一个人操作，事情很少，他认为这是一种人力上的浪费。他和老矿工们进一步研究，并征得领导上同意，改为“集中操作”，取消煤溜子管理工，改由溜子机头的装车工管理。这样，一个人管理可以顶上两个人的功效。
    在坑口、坑下的时刻，六十二组采煤工人的许多忘我劳动、革新技术的模范事迹告诉人们：一支由新技术装备起来的地下大车正在从各个角落里成长起来。（附图片）
