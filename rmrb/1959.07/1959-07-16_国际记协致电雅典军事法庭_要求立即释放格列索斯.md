The International Federation of Journalists said in a telegram to the President of the Athens Military Court today that the first few days of the trial of Glezos proved that the accusation against this Greek national hero was extremely unjust, and the trial itself was illegal.

    国际记协致电雅典军事法庭
    要求立即释放格列索斯
    新华社布拉格14日电　国际新闻工作者协会今天在给雅典军事法庭庭长的一份电报中说，对格列索斯的头几天的审讯证明，控告这位希腊民族英雄是极不公正的，审讯本身就是非法的。
    电报说，国际新闻工作者协会由于格列索斯是它的会员而感到骄傲，并且再次有力地要求停止这场不公正的审讯，立即释放格列索斯。
