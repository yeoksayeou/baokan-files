    Transparent Gauze
    The jade swallow multi-colored cool transparent gauze produced by Shanghai No. 5 Printing and Dyeing Factory is treated with chemical pulp. The fabric has diamond patterns, looks very much like linen, does not easily attract dust, and is most suitable for shirts to wear in summer.

    透明纱
    上海第五印染厂生产的玉燕杂色透凉纱，这种布是经过化学浆处理的。布上有菱形花纹，很像麻织品，不易沾染灰尘，最适宜做夏天穿的衬衫。
