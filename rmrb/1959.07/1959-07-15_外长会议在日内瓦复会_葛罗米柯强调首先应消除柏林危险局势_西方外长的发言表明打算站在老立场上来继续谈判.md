Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 13th: The Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference resumed on the 13th after a three-week recess, according to TASS reports from Geneva.

　　The "House of Journalists" in Geneva was once again packed with reporters. Swiss newspapers devoted considerable space to covering the resumption of the conference. The main topics of discussion in newspaper commentary and among the journalists gathered at the "House of Journalists" were the prospects for the conference. Many newspapers expressed hope for the success of the conference, placing this hope in the Soviet proposals of June 9th and 19th—some directly, others more cautiously. The main feature of these two Soviet proposals is that they are based on consideration for the attitudes of other negotiating participants.

　　Those opposed to reaching an agreement have expended considerable effort during the conference recess to distort the substance of the Soviet proposals and obstruct agreements based on them. They have been particularly keen on spreading the idea that specifying a validity period for the interim agreement on West Berlin proposed by the Soviet Union would mean that all the rights of the three Western powers in West Berlin would automatically disappear after this period, and the Soviet Union would immediately take unilateral action against West Berlin. Like other rash "interpretations" of the Soviet proposals, this claim has now been thoroughly refuted. All of this convinces objective observers that the conference will resume in a situation conducive to reaching an agreement; if the Western countries have the sincerity to reach an agreement, it is entirely possible to reach an agreement quickly.

　　However, the first speech by U.S. Secretary of State Herter at the first plenary session after the resumption of the conference showed that the U.S. delegation had returned to the conference with the same old baggage and intended to continue negotiations from its old positions.

　　The conference began at 3:30 PM Geneva time on the 13th, presided over by Herter. He spoke first and made a statement on behalf of the U.S. delegation, which he said outlined the results of the conference's initial six weeks of work.

　　Herter's overview of the situation before the start of the second phase of the conference merely repeated the arguments of the Western delegations in order to justify their attitudes. His speech indicated that the U.S. delegation had not used the recess, which the West itself called a "time for consideration," to change its negative attitude that obstructs reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.

　　It seems that, seeing that the open comparison of Soviet and Western attitudes in the eyes of world public opinion was clearly unfavorable to the U.S., Britain, and France, Herter suggested moving to closed meetings after the plenary session on the 13th.

　　French delegation head Couve de Murville then spoke, expressing satisfaction with Herter's speech. He fully agreed with Herter's proposal to immediately move to informal meetings with the participation of some members.

　　British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in a brief speech, pointed out that before the conference recess, some Soviet documents had not been well studied, such as the Soviet document on the Berlin issue presented on June 19th, Khrushchev's speech on June 19th, and Gromyko's statement on June 19th. Lloyd also mentioned Gromyko's statement in Moscow on June 28th during the recess.

　　Lloyd said that the first task of the conference participants was to eliminate the ambiguities that still existed in order to clarify the possibilities for bringing the views of the two sides closer.

　　Lloyd said that there was overlap between the two basic proposals, namely the Western countries' "Berlin Interim Arrangement" proposal of June 16th and the Soviet proposal of June 19th. Lloyd believed that discussions should not continue on the basis of this or that document, but that issues must be discussed item by item. Lloyd concluded by saying that he agreed with Herter's opinion that the next meeting should be a closed meeting with the participation of some members.

　　Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko then spoke.

　　Gromyko said, "We have returned to Geneva and gathered together again to continue negotiations. We are faced with studying the issues related to Germany, and first of all, formulating measures to eliminate the dangerous situation in Berlin. In the course of the negotiations, certain other issues raised by the conference participants have not yet been studied, and these issues are of considerable significance from the perspective of easing international tensions and consolidating peace."

　　Gromyko pointed out that the initial reaction to the new Soviet proposals of June 19th was only the result of a prejudiced and preliminary understanding. However, the West increasingly realized that the new initiatives of the Soviet government increased the possibility of reaching an agreement. Gromyko suggested that the second phase of the conference should begin with a discussion of the Soviet proposals of June 19th, and that negotiations should continue.

　　Gromyko said that if the Soviet government's proposals on the Berlin issue are compared with the three Western countries' proposals of June 16th, it can be seen that some viewpoints are no longer so far apart. He said that if the governments of the Western countries truly hope to reach an agreement, then there is a basis for reaching such an agreement in the Soviet proposals. If an agreement could be reached on the issue of reducing the foreign troops in West Berlin to a symbolic number and not stationing nuclear weapons and rocket weapons there, it would essentially ease the situation in Berlin and throughout Europe. The Soviet Union also put forward a proposal to stop hostile propaganda and subversive activities from the territory of West Berlin against the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries, and this issue was also mentioned in the Western countries' proposals, but the way it was raised was unacceptable in any way. The Western proposals distorted the essence of the facts and attempted to equate the situation in East Berlin and West Berlin.

　　The head of the Soviet delegation criticized those in Bonn who were trying in every possible way to obstruct the participating countries of the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement. He pointed out that provocative and destructive activities in West Berlin have recently become particularly rampant. He cited as an example the fact that the West German authorities held a demonstrative activity in West Berlin to elect the West German president, even though West Berlin is by no means a part of the Federal Republic of Germany. And the governments of the United States, Britain, and France condone this provocative action by Bonn.

　　Gromyko believed that the reason for the differences in the positions of the Soviet Union and the Western countries on the Berlin issue is that the United States, Britain, and France are trying to maintain the occupation regime in West Berlin forever, while the Soviet Union advocates eliminating the occupation regime, because the urgent interests of normalizing the situation in Germany and throughout Europe require this.

　　Gromyko said that making West Berlin a demilitarized free city is the correct way to solve the problem. In a situation where the positions of the conference participants are still inconsistent, the way out may be to reach an agreement on some urgent and practical steps to promote the easing of the situation in West Berlin and Germany, and then reach an agreement on the interim status of West Berlin. The Soviet Union's recent proposals provide for such a solution. The Soviet Union proposed an interim agreement with a validity period of one and a half years, and the question is sometimes raised on this point: does this proposal mean that after the expiration of the period agreed upon by the conference participants, there will only be one path left—the path of unilateral Soviet action? But everyone is very clear that we propose to continue negotiations after the expiration of the interim agreement. If the Soviet government was only referring to unilateral action in dealing with the West Berlin issue, then it could do so now.

　　Some have suggested that it is best not to mention the issue of a deadline at all. Gromyko said that this is equivalent to asking the Soviet Union to agree to the permanentization of the occupation regime in West Berlin, and the Soviet Union cannot do this, and will never do this, because it would mean canceling all possible foundations for reaching an agreement.

　　Gromyko went on to point out that no matter how urgent and important the task of formulating an agreement on the West Berlin issue itself is, it is far from including all the unresolved issues concerning Germany, first and foremost the central and key issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany. If an agreement can be reached on an all-German committee, then this will greatly help the efforts made by the countries concerned in striving for peace with Germany.

　　Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet Union is by no means suggesting that only the Germans themselves should prepare the peace treaty. It also believes that the draft peace treaty should be agreed upon by the major countries concerned, first and foremost the current conference participants. In addition, everyone knows that the Soviet government proposed that the draft peace treaty with Germany be submitted to a peace conference held by all countries that had sent troops to fight against Hitler's Germany. The Soviet government has repeatedly emphasized that some of Germany's neighbors, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, have a vital interest in resolving the German issue, including the issue of a peace treaty with Germany.

　　Referring to the Western countries' representatives' opposition to the Soviet proposal to form an all-German committee on the principle of equality, Gromyko said that on this issue, adopting such a solution is the only correct one, and this solution will not give one side an advantage over the other. In other words, like any other equal negotiation, both sides should have equal rights and the same conditions.

　　German Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Bolz then spoke. He said, "Our delegation has returned to Geneva with confidence, and it once again firmly demands the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and it will express the hopes and demands of the vast majority of the German people."

　　Bolz pointed out that the reunification of Germany can only be achieved through the rapprochement and understanding of the two Germanies. The Adenauer government does not allow any possibility of progress in this regard, while the German Democratic Republic sincerely hopes to realistically seek a rapprochement of the views of the two Germanies. The proposals put forward by the German Democratic Republic for equal negotiations between delegations from the two Germanies to facilitate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the reunification of Germany, and for the conclusion of a treaty of non-aggression between the two Germanies, are proof of this sincerity.

　　Bolz went on to talk about the West Berlin issue, pointing out that the rampant activities of revanchists in West Berlin prove the urgent need to solve this problem. The purpose of holding the West German presidential election in West Berlin is to oppose the Geneva Conference and to try to nullify all efforts to reach mutual understanding at this conference.

　　Bolz went on to say that the best solution to the West Berlin issue can be found within the framework of a peace treaty with Germany. Establishing a demilitarized free city in West Berlin is the most appropriate way to solve the problem. However, this principled view of the government of the German Democratic Republic does not exclude other avenues and methods to promote an agreement at this conference. Therefore, the expedient solution to the West Berlin issue proposed by the Soviet delegation with the consent of the German Democratic Republic delegation has received the full support of the German Democratic Republic and the widespread support of its people.

　　Bolz concluded by expressing the hope that the Soviet proposals of June 9th and 19th will be fully understood by all participants in the conference.

　　Federal Republic of Germany representative Grewe then spoke, his speech proving that the Bonn government's position has not changed in any way and that it still wants to continue to try its best to obstruct any agreement on the issues discussed at the conference. Grewe supported Herter's proposal.

　　Then, Gromyko commented on Herter's proposal. He said, "We are willing to participate in small meetings and symposia, but these must be meetings in which all countries participating in the Geneva Conference participate. The Soviet Union cannot agree if certain countries are subject to some kind of restriction."

　　The conference participants decided to hold a plenary session at 3:30 PM on July 15th.

    外长会议在日内瓦复会
    葛罗米柯强调首先应消除柏林危险局势
    西方外长的发言表明打算站在老立场上来继续谈判
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦13日讯：日内瓦外长会议经过三星期的休会以后于13日复会。
    日内瓦“记者之家”又挤满了记者。瑞士报纸用很大篇幅来报道这次复会。报纸评论以及聚集在“记者之家”的记者们谈论的主要题目是会议的前途问题。许多报纸在标题和文章中都表示希望会议成功，并且把这种希望寄托在苏联6月9日和19日的建议上——一些人是直接地表示，而另一些人较为谨慎地表示。苏联这两项建议的主要特点是，它们是以考虑其他谈判参加者的态度为基础的。
    反对达成协议的人在会议休会期间费了不少力气来歪曲苏联建议的实质和阻挠在这些建议的基础上达成协议。他们特别热中于散布这样一种说法：说什么给苏联提出的西柏林临时协定规定一个有效期限就意味着，一过这个期限西方三国在西柏林的一切权利就会自动消失，苏联就会立即对西柏林采取单方面的行动。像对苏联建议的其他轻率的“解释”一样，这种说法现在都被彻底驳倒了。所有这一切使客观的观察家们深信，会议将在有利于达成协议的情况下复会；只要西方国家有达成协议的诚意，迅速达成协议是完全可能的。
    但是，美国国务卿赫脱在复会后第一次全体会议上的第一篇发言表明，美国代表团还是带着老一套的东西回来参加会议，并且打算站在自己的老立场上来继续谈判。
    这次会议在13日日内瓦时间十五点三十分开始，由赫脱主持。他首先发言并且以美国代表的身份发表了一个声明，据他说，这个声明概述了会议最初六周的工作结果。
    赫脱对会议第二阶段开始前的局面所作的概述，只不过重复了西方国家代表团的论据以便为它们的态度辩护。他的发言表明，美国代表团并没有利用这段西方自己所谓“用来进行考虑”的休会时间来改变它们那种消极的、阻碍达成双方可以接受的协议的态度。
    看来，由于赫脱看到，苏联的态度和西方国家的态度在世界舆论面前公开对照，对美英法是明显不利的，他建议在13日的全体会议以后转入秘密会议。
    法国代表团团长德姆维尔接着发言表示满意赫脱的发言。他完全同意赫脱提出的关于立即转入部分成员参加的非正式会议的建议。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在简短的发言中指出，在会议休会以前，苏联的一些文件没有被很好研究，譬如对苏联6月19日提出的关于柏林问题的文件，赫鲁晓夫6月19日的演说以及葛罗米柯6月19日的声明等等，都没有进行足够的研究。劳埃德还提到了休会期间葛罗米柯6月28日在莫斯科发表的声明。
    劳埃德说，会议参加者的第一项任务就是消除目前还存在的不明确之处，以便弄清使双方观点接近的可能性。
    劳埃德说，在两个基本建议，即西方国家6月16日提出的“柏林临时安排”建议同苏联6月19日提出的建议之间有吻合之处，劳埃德认为，不应当以这个或那个文件为基础来继续进行讨论，而必须逐项讨论问题。劳埃德最后说，他同意赫脱的意见，认为下次会议应当是部分成员参加的秘密会议。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯接着发言。
    葛罗米柯说，我们又回到日内瓦，聚集一堂继续谈判了。我们面临着研究有关德国的问题，首先是，拟订消除柏林危险局势的措施。在谈判过程中，会议参加者提出的某些其他问题也还未研究，这些问题从缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的角度来看是具有颇大意义的。
    葛罗米柯指出，苏联在6月19日提出新建议以后最初的反应只是带有偏见的初步了解的结果。但是，往后西方越来越了解到，苏联政府的新倡议增加了达成协议的可能性。葛罗米柯建议，会议的第二阶段应从讨论苏联在6月19日提出的建议开始，继续举行谈判。
    葛罗米柯说，如果把苏联政府关于柏林问题的建议同西方三国6月16日的建议比较一下，就可以看出其中有些观点已经不是相距那么远。他说，如果西方国家的政府真正希望达成协议，那么，苏联的建议中就有达成这种协议的基础。如果就把西柏林的外国军队缩减到象征性数目和不在那里设置核武器和火箭武器的问题达成协议，实质上就缓和了柏林和整个欧洲的局势。苏联还提出了关于停止从西柏林领土上进行反对德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家的敌对宣传和颠复活动的建议，而在西方国家的建议中也提到了这个问题，但是，提出这一问题的方式是无论如何不能接受的。西方的建议中歪曲了事实的实质，企图对东柏林和西柏林的局势等同起来。
    苏联代表团团长抨击波恩那些企图千方百计地阻挠日内瓦会议参加国之间达成协议的人。他指出，西柏林挑衅活动和破坏活动最近显得特别猖獗。他举例说，西德当局在西柏林举行了选举西德总统的示威性活动，尽管西柏林绝不是德意志联邦共和国的一部分。而美国、英国和法国政府袒护波恩的这种挑衅行动。
    葛罗米柯认为苏联和西方国家在柏林问题上的立场出现分歧的原因是，美国、英国和法国竭力想永远保持西柏林占领制度而苏联却主张消除占领制度，因为德国和整个欧洲局势正常化的迫切利益要求这样做。
    葛罗米柯说，使西柏林成为非军事化自由城市是解决问题的正确办法。在会议参加者立场还不一致的情况下，出路可以是就促进缓和西柏林和德国局势的一些迫切和实际的步骤达成协议，然后就西柏林的临时地位问题达成协议。苏联最近的建议中就规定了这样的解决办法。苏联提出临时协定有效期限为一年半，关于这一点有时会提出这样的问题：这个建议是否意味着，在会议参加者达成协议的期限满期以后就只剩下了一条道路——苏联单方面行动的道路。但是大家都很清楚，我们建议临时协定期满后还要进行谈判。如果苏联政府在对待西柏林问题上只是指的单方面行动，那么它现在就可以这样做。
    有人提出，最好在这一点上根本不提期限问题。葛罗米柯说，这就等于要求苏联同意西柏林占领制度永久化，而苏联不能这样，也永远不会这样做，因为这意味着取消一切可能达成协议的基础。
    葛罗米柯接着指出，不管在西柏林问题上拟定协定的任务本身多么迫切和重要，然而它还远不能包括有关德国的一切尚未解决的问题，首先是有关缔结对德和约这个中心和关键问题。如果能够就全德委员会达成协议，那么，这在很大程度上有助于有关国家在争取对德媾和方面所作的努力。
    葛罗米柯指出，苏联决不是建议只由德国人自己来准备和约，它还认为和约草案应该由主要的有关国家，首先是目前会议参加者达成协议。此外，大家知道，苏联政府建议把对德和约草案提交曾经出兵参加对希特勒德国作战的一切国家所举行的和会上讨论。苏联政府曾经一再强调指出，像波兰和捷克斯洛伐克这样一些德国的邻国同解决德国问题，其中包括对德和约问题的切身的利害关系。
    葛罗米柯谈到西方国家代表反对苏联提出的以对等原则组成全德委员会的建议时说，在这个问题上，采取这种解决办法是唯一正确的，这种解决办法不会使一方对另一方占优势。换句话说，就像任何其他平等的谈判一样，双方应该有平等的权利和同样的条件。
    德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨接着发言。他说，我们的代表团充满信心地回到了日内瓦，它再一次坚决要求尽速缔结对德和约，它将表达绝大多数德国人民的希望和要求。
    博尔茨指出，只能通过两个德国的接近和谅解才能达到德国的重新统一。阿登纳政府不允许在这方面有任何进展的可能，而德意志民主共和国真诚地希望实事求是地求得两个德国观点的接近。德意志民主共和国提出的关于两个德国代表团进行有利于缔结对德和约和重新统一德国的平等的谈判，两个德国之间缔结互不侵犯条约，就是这种诚意的证明。
    博尔茨接着谈到西柏林问题，他指出，复仇主义分子在西柏林的猖獗活动证明迫切需要解决这个问题。在西柏林举行西德总统选举目的在于反对日内瓦会议和想把争取在这次会议上达到相互谅解的一切努力化为乌有。
    博尔茨接着说，西柏林问题在对德和约范围内是可以找到最好的解决办法的。建立西柏林非军事化自由城市是解决问题的最恰当办法。但是，德意志民主共和国政府这一原则性观点并不排斥促进在这次会议上达成协议的其他途径和办法。因此，苏联代表团取得德意志民主共和国代表团同意而提出的关于解决西柏林问题的权宜办法就得到了德意志民主共和国的完全支持和它的人民的普遍拥护。
    博尔茨最后希望，6月9日和19日的苏联建议将能够得到会议全体参加者的充分理解。
    德意志联邦共和国代表格雷韦接着发言，他的发言证明，波恩政府的立场没有任何改变，仍想继续竭力阻挠就会议所讨论的问题达成任何协议。格雷韦支持赫脱的建议。
    然后，葛罗米柯就赫脱的建议发表了意见。他说，我们愿意参加小型的会议和座谈，但是这必须是参加日内瓦会议的所有国家都参加的会议。如果对某些国家加以某种限制，苏联是不能同意的。
    会议参加者决定，在7月15日下午三时三十分举行全体会议。
