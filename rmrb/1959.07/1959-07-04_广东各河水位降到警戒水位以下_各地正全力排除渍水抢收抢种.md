Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 3rd: Water levels in the West River, North River, and the river network areas of the Pearl River Delta all fell below warning levels on the 2nd.

Because the floods in Guangdong this time lasted for quite a long time, the time it took for the water levels of various rivers to fall from exceeding the warning level to below the warning level generally exceeded half a month. As a result, the waterlogged areas within the embankments of the Pearl River Delta river network could not be drained outwards for a time, and many rice and other crops were flooded. Up to now, there are still about 600,000 mu of farmland submerged by waterlogging within the embankments. Now, all localities have dispatched pumps, dragon bone waterwheels, and other drainage tools to make every effort to drain the waterlogged areas and carry out rushing to harvest and replant.

    广东各河水位降到警戒水位以下
    各地正全力排除渍水抢收抢种
    新华社广州3日电　西江、北江和珠江三角洲河网地带各江河水位2日已全部降到警戒水位以下。
    由于广东这次洪水延续时间相当长，各江河水位从超过警戒水位到退至警戒水位以下的时间一般超过半个月以上，因此珠江三角洲河网地带堤围内渍水一时无法往外排，不少水稻和其他农作物受淹。到目前为止，还有六十万亩左右的耕地受围内渍水的淹浸。现在各地已出动抽水机、龙骨水车等所有排水工具，全力排除渍水和进行抢收抢种。
