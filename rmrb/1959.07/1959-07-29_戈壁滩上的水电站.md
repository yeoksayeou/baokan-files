Xinhua News Agency, Kashgar, July 27th: A hydroelectric power station with a capacity of 6,000 kilowatts has been built in the southern Xinjiang region, inhabited by the Uyghur people.

This hydroelectric power station was built on the Gobi Desert fifteen kilometers from Kashgar city, and the construction project was very arduous. During the construction process, the workers excavated more than 300,000 cubic meters of earth and stone just to dig the water diversion canal and build the underground plant, which is twenty-eight meters deep. The construction of the entire power station took more than a year.

The generators, pressure steel pipes, and other equipment for the hydroelectric power station were all supported by Harbin, Shenyang, and Chongqing.

Kashgar is the largest city in the southern Xinjiang region. Since liberation, small factories for flour, cotton ginning, and agricultural implements have been established. Currently, large factories such as a textile mill with 50,000 spindles and an automobile repair shop are also under construction. After the Kashgar Hydroelectric Power Station is completed, it will be able to provide sufficient electricity for the city's industrial enterprises and urban lighting.

    戈壁滩上的水电站
    新华社喀什27日电　维吾尔族聚居的南疆地区建成一座设备容量六千瓩的水电站。
    这座水电站建在距喀什市十五公里的戈壁上，水源来自喀什噶尔河，修建工程非常艰巨。施工过程中，工人仅开挖引水大渠和修建深达二十八米的地下厂房，就挖掘了三十多万立方米的土石。整个电站的修建用了一年多的时间。
    水电站的发电机、压力钢管等各种器材都是哈尔滨、沈阳和重庆等地支援的。
    喀什是南疆地区最大城市。解放以来先后建立起面粉、轧花、农具等小型工厂，目前还正在兴建五万纱锭的纺织厂、汽车修配等大型工厂。喀什水电站建成后就可以为全市工业企业和城市照明提供充足的电力。
