Xinhua News Agency Report: On the eve of the illegal trial of Greek national hero Manolis Glezos and other patriots by the Greek authorities, a massive movement of defense and support is unfolding vigorously around the world.

The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the International Organization of Journalists have protested the Greek government's atrocities in persecuting Greek hero Glezos. The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth issued an appeal to the youth of the world, stating that the World Federation of Democratic Youth, representing youth from all over the world, protests the Greek authorities' frame-up of Glezos and calls on the youth of the world, together with world public opinion, to demand the release of Glezos.

In socialist countries, the wave of protest against the Greek authorities' persecution of national hero Glezos is even higher, with people continuing to resolutely demand that the Greek authorities immediately release Glezos.

The Soviet National Parliamentary Group Committee wrote to Kodazzi-Pisanelli, Chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and Secretary-General de Blonay, calling on the Inter-Parliamentary Union and progressive people to jointly demand the immediate release of Greek national hero Glezos. The Soviet National Parliamentary Group Committee also expressed the will of the Soviet people: demanding that Greek parliamentarians organize to stop the persecution, save Glezos' life, and guarantee his freedom.

Workers in Moscow, Riga, Kaliningrad, and Tashkent, Stalinabad and Vilnius, collective farm members and state farm workers in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and other republics held rallies to angrily protest the Greek government's unreasonable persecution of Glezos, the glorious son of the Greek people.

For days, workers in various factories in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, have held rallies to protest the Greek authorities' attempt to try Glezos by military court. The Presidium of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Central Council of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Greek government on July 4, protesting its violation of human rights and demanding the release of Glezos and the cessation of persecution of patriots.

On July 6, mass rallies were held at the Motorcycle Factory, the Steel Factory, and the Kasputok Radio Factory in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. The workers present at the meeting stated in a telegram to the Greek authorities that they, together with world public opinion, demanded the release of Greek patriot Glezos and demanded that he be granted the right to civil action.

The wave of protest against submitting the Glezos case to a military court continues to rise in Greece. According to the "Dawn Daily," trade unions, social groups, residents, and individuals have all called for the immediate release of Glezos and the restoration of domestic democracy and freedom. The struggle to save Glezos has a national character. The Greek Committee for the Protection of Human Rights issued a statement in the newspaper on July 8, protesting the authorities' continuous undermining of basic human rights, civil liberties, and the cancellation of constitutional and judicial guarantees.

The Committee for the Defense of Glezos and Democratic Trade Union Tradition issued a resolution to Greek politicians protesting the submission of the Glezos case to a military court.

The French Communist Party issued a statement on July 7, expressing solidarity with the Greek working class and democrats in their movement to protest the attempted murder of Glezos. The statement said that in order to strengthen the momentum of the movement, the people must take action to thwart the conspiracy of those who seek to kill Glezos. The statement emphasized that the French people, who have always defended the cause of justice, regard Glezos' cause as their own.

In Italy, a group of prominent activists issued an appeal to the Italian public, calling on people to write letters and send telegrams to the Greek Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, or the Greek Ambassador in Rome, demanding that Glezos be guaranteed the right to defense and appeal.
