    Upholding Collective Leadership, Making Many Close Friends
    The Yingju Team Party Branch Consistently Follows the Mass Line
    (Our Dispatch) This reporter, Chen Jian, reports: The Yingju People's Commune Yingju Production Brigade Party Branch in Fengqiu County, Henan Province, has established a set of working methods that are linked to reality and the masses, and a democratic style of fully trusting the masses. In their work, they can promptly combine the demands of the masses and outstandingly complete the Party's tasks.
    The Yingju Production Brigade is the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative introduced by Chairman Mao in the first issue of "Red Flag" magazine last year. The Party branch of this team led the masses of the entire team in overcoming years of extraordinary floods, realizing river networkization, and converting to rice cultivation, achieving great success in their work.
    The characteristic of this branch's work is its consistent adherence to the mass line leadership method of "collective leadership and all Party members shining" for several years. The brigade Party branch secretary grasps overall work, while other branch committee members divide lines and areas to take responsibility for each production team. Among Party members, the method of "relatives wrapping relatives, neighbors wrapping neighbors, and each person making their own close friends" is adopted, so that each Party member can make close friends around them and within their responsible households. The extent to which Party members understand the situation and problems of their "confidants" and the masses is listed by the branch as one of the important contents for assessing the level of consciousness of each Party member, and work competitions are carried out in this area between Party groups and between Party members, and a system of criticism and commendation is established. Therefore, the branch is described by the masses as having "a thousand ears and ten thousand eyes." The branch committee utilizes this advantageous condition to frequently hold expanded branch committee meetings, absorbing more than half of the Party members to participate, and widely absorbing opinions from the masses, so that any decision of the branch has a solid mass foundation. In particular, after the branch's resolutions are issued, it can immediately organize all Party members to go deep into the homes of team members with special difficulties to understand their specific difficulties and help solve them in a timely manner.
    This branch also frequently listens to the opinions of the masses and conducts work according to the correct opinions of the masses. For example, after a Party member heard a ditty from a "close friend" about the masses lacking small change to spend and reported it to the branch, the branch committee convened an expanded branch committee meeting to conduct serious research, and finally decided to implement the policy of simultaneously developing agriculture and sideline production. Two months later, sideline income reached more than 10,000 yuan. At this time, individual cadres developed the idea of only engaging in sideline production. After the branch committee members and Party members heard the reflections of many team members, they immediately convened a general meeting of all team members to discuss their views on "walking on two legs." Many team members said, "Relaxing agriculture is not beneficial to the country, nor is it beneficial to individuals. 'Eating' comes first." Now, the agricultural and sideline production of the Yingju Brigade are both red flags in the county.
    In 1957, the Yingju Brigade encountered an extraordinary flood. All Party members immediately widely solicited opinions from dozens of sideline production experts and thrifty housekeepers in the entire team, held forums, concentrated hundreds of opinions, found more than 30 ways to engage in sideline production, and formulated a plan for production self-rescue and thrift to overcome the famine, outstandingly overcoming the disaster. Branch committee member Dong Shouzhen learned from a group of "close friends" that they had objections to wages being distributed to households. The reason was that their wages were equally divided by their parents-in-law and husbands. The branch immediately adopted the opinions of the female team members and decided: "No wages will be issued without seeing the person." This greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the women.
    The team members of the Yingju Brigade know that the branch attaches great importance to their various opinions, so they can speak freely. Expanded branch committee meetings or Party member meetings can reflect hundreds of opinions and demands from the masses.
    This branch can also fully believe in the masses and consciously accept the Party's various policies. For some work, even if the masses cannot accept it immediately, they always insist on patient persuasion and education, and sometimes organize airing of views and discussions, so that the masses gradually understand the consistency of the Party's policies and their interests. In 1957, in the face of an extraordinary flood, the masses could not accept the development of water conservancy. The branch organized the masses to study the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee and the experience of typical areas in water conservancy, and put forward the slogan "Remove the label of disaster area, remove the label of low yield." After the masses understood the Party's policies, they all consciously signed up to go to the water conservancy construction site. When the state lacked water conservancy technicians to help them measure, they studied and measured themselves. Because the branch can deeply publicize the Party's policies, the masses of this brigade are very familiar with many important policies of the Party. People from neighboring villages often send people to invite them to give reports. The branch believes that the Party's policies are always consistent with the interests of the masses, and it itself has the power to mobilize all positive factors. Therefore, as long as the policies are patiently handed over to the masses, the masses can consciously complete any task. (Attached picture)

### 坚持集体领导  广交知心朋友  应举队党支部一贯走群众路线

    坚持集体领导  广交知心朋友
    应举队党支部一贯走群众路线
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：河南省封丘县应举人民公社应举生产大队党支部，建立了一套联系实际：联系群众的工作方法和充分相信群众的民主作风。在工作中，他们能及时结合群众的要求，出色地完成党的任务。
    应举生产大队，就是去年第一期“红旗”杂志里毛主席介绍的应举农业社。这个队的党支部领导全队群众战胜了连年的特大水灾，实现了河网化，改种了水稻，工作有很大的成绩。
    这个支部的工作特点是几年如一日地坚持了“集体领导和全体党员都发光”的群众路线的领导方法。大队支部书记抓全面工作，其他支委分线分片包干各生产小队。党员中采取了“亲包亲、邻包邻、各人交各人的知心人”的办法，使每个党员都在自己的周围和责任户内，交知心朋友。党员对自己的“知己”和群众的情况和问题了解的程度如何，被支部列为考核每个党员觉悟高低的重要内容之一，并在这方面开展了党小组与党小组、党员与党员之间的工作竞赛，建立了批评与表扬制度。因此，支部在群众中，被形容为有“千只耳朵万只眼”。支委会利用这个有利条件，经常召开支委扩大会议，吸收半数以上的党员参加，广泛吸取来自群众的意见，使支部的任何一项决定，都有充分的群众基础。特别是支部的决议下达后，又能立即组织全体党员深入有特殊困难的社员家中，了解他们的具体困难，及时帮助解决。
    这个支部还经常听取群众的意见，按照群众的正确意见进行工作。如一个党员从“知心朋友”那里听到一首群众缺少零钱花的快板，向支部反映以后，支委会就召开支委扩大会议，认真地作了研究，最后决定贯彻农副业生产并举的方针。两个月后，副业收入达到一万多元。这时，个别干部又产生了光搞副业生产的思想。支委和党员们听到许多社员反映后，又马上召开全体社员大会，讨论了对“两条腿走路”的看法。许多社员都说：“放松农业，不利国家，也不利个人。‘吃’是第一。”现在，应举大队的农、副业生产都是全县的一面红旗。
    1957年应举大队遇到了特大的水灾，全体党员立即在全队几十名副业生产能手和勤俭持家能手中，广泛征求意见，召开座谈会，集中了几百条意见，找了三十多种副业生产门路，制定了生产自救、节约度荒的规划，出色地战胜了灾荒。支委董守贞在一群“知心人”那里，了解到她们对工资发到户有意见。原因是她们的工资都被公婆丈夫平分了。支部马上采纳了女社员们的意见，决定：“不见人不发工资。”这就大大地激励了妇女们的劳动热情。
    应举大队的社员们知道支部非常重视他们的各种意见，因此，都能畅所欲言。支委扩大会议或党员大会，都能反映出上百条来自群众中的意见和要求。
    这个支部还能够充分相信群众自觉地接受党的各项政策。有些工作，即使群众马上不能接受，他们总是坚持耐心说服教育，有时则组织鸣放讨论，使群众逐渐地了解党的政策和他们利益的一致性。1957年在特大的水灾面前，群众对开展水利化运动接受不了，支部组织群众学习中央、省委的指示和典型地区水利化的经验，并提出“摘掉灾区帽子，摘掉低产帽子”的口号。群众了解了党的政策后，都自觉地报名上水利工地去。当国家缺少水利技术人员不能帮助他们测量时，他们就自己学习、自己测量。因为支部能够深入宣传党的政策，所以，这个大队的群众对党的许多重要政策，非常熟悉，邻村群众经常派人来请他们去作报告。支部认为：党的政策永远和群众的利益相一致，它本身就有调动一切积极因素的力量，因此，只要耐心地把政策交给群众，什么任务，群众都能自觉地完成。（附图片）
