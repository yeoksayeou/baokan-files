Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Telegram. Jiangsu Province, from the time new grain came onto the market on June 7th to July 8th, has exceeded its summer grain purchase plan by 5.1%. The grain stored generally meets the requirements of being clean, full, and free of insects.

Jiangsu Province, in accordance with the principle of considering the interests of the state, the commune, and its members, has rationally retained the food rations and seeds for its members and arranged for fodder grain while completing the purchase tasks. The food rations retained for the rural population are generally sufficient until the autumn harvest season. Some communes, due to abundant wheat harvests, have increased both the grain sold to the state and the food rations retained for their members compared to last year. For example, the average yield per unit area of wheat in the Yanzibu Commune of Pizhou County this year increased by 30% compared to the highest year in history. This year, this commune sold 1.3 million jin of wheat, exceeding the state purchase plan by 300,000 jin. The commune also retained 25 jin of seeds per mu of wheat land, and the members retained an average of more than 80 jin of food rations per person, more than 20% higher than last year. In addition, 260,000 jin of new grain were stored in reserve.

The characteristics of this year's summer grain purchase work in Jiangsu Province are early, fast, and good. Specifically, this is reflected in: cadres having great enthusiasm, the masses having high enthusiasm, the purchase policy being well implemented, the speed of grain entering the warehouse being fast, and the quality of the grain being good.

In order to quickly organize the summer purchase of grain into storage, Party committees at all levels, after the three wheat crops matured, resolutely implemented the principle of quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick purchasing, and quick transportation, organized a large number of cadres to go to the communes and production teams to help arrange work, and publicized the purchase policy and purchase methods to the masses, so that the masses understood that selling grain early and selling good grain not only supported the country's industrial construction, but also could timely increase the commune's production funds, which was beneficial to both the country and the commune. At the same time as the purchase, the distribution of food rations and seeds was combined. In this way, the masses had high enthusiasm and enthusiastically sold surplus grain.

In order to ensure that summer planting and grain delivery were not delayed, people's communes in various places rationally arranged labor and tools, organized professional teams to produce during the day, and thresh and deliver grain at night. Grain departments actively improved purchase methods to facilitate the masses' sales and storage. Before the new grain began to enter the warehouse, grain departments universally established democratic price negotiation organizations, trained purchasing personnel, strictly inspected grain quality during the purchase process, and implemented the policy of grading and pricing and paying higher prices for better quality.

At present, in addition to urging the few counties and communes that have not yet completed the purchase plan to complete the plan as soon as possible, the areas that have completed the task are summarizing experience, affirming achievements, mobilizing the masses to re-thresh and re-harvest, properly handling outstanding issues, arranging life, and doing a good job in production to strive for a greater harvest in the autumn.

    国家公社社员三者兼顾　口粮种子饲料合理安排
    江苏超额完成夏粮征购计划
    新华社南京电　江苏省从6月7日新粮上市到7月8日为止，已超额5.1％完成了夏粮征购计划。入库的粮食一般都符合干净、饱满和无虫的要求。
    江苏各地根据国家、公社和社员三者兼顾的原则，在完成征购任务的同时，已经合理留下了社员口粮和种籽，安排了饲料粮。农村人口留的口粮，一般都能吃到秋季新粮登场时节。有的公社由于麦子丰收，向国家交售的粮食和社员留的口粮都比去年增加。如邳县燕子埠公社今年的小麦平均单位面积产量，比历史上最高年提高30％，今年这个公社交售了一百三十万斤小麦，超额三十万斤完成了国家的征购计划，全社每亩小麦地还留有种籽二十五斤，社员平均每人留有口粮八十多斤，比去年多20％以上，此外还储备了二十六万斤新粮。
    江苏省今年夏粮征购工作的特点是早、快、好。具体表现在：干部干劲大，群众热情高，政策贯彻执行好，入库速度快，粮食质量好。
    各级党委为了迅速组织夏季征购粮食入库，在三麦成熟以后，就坚决实行快收、快打、快购、快运的原则，组织大批干部，到公社和生产队去帮助安排工作，向群众宣传征购政策和征购办法，使群众了解早卖粮和卖好粮不但支援了国家工业建设，而且可以及时增加公社的生产资金，对国家对公社都有好处。在征购的同时，又结合分配口粮和种籽。这样，群众热情很高，踊跃出卖余粮。
    各地人民公社为了作到夏种、送粮两不误，都合理安排了劳力和工具，组织专业队伍，白天生产，夜晚脱粒、送粮。粮食部门积极改进收购方法，便利群众交售入库。粮食部门在新粮开始入库以前，普遍建立了民主议价组织，训练了收购人员，在收购过程中，严格检验粮质，贯彻执行了分等论价、优质优价的政策。
    目前，省内各地除了督促少数尚未完成征购计划的县、公社赶快完成计划以外，已完成任务的地区都在总结经验，肯定成绩，发动群众复打复收，妥善处理遗留问题，安排生活，搞好生产，争取秋季更大丰收。
