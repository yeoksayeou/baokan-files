    Congratulations on the Victory of Ascending Muztagh Ata Peak
    The thirty-three young male and female athletes of the Chinese mixed Muztagh Ata Mountaineering Team, with unparalleled perseverance, overcame numerous difficulties and, after several days of marching, finally collectively and safely reached the summit of Muztagh Ata, the "Father of Ice Mountains" at 7,546 meters above sea level in western Xinjiang, on July 7th, setting a world record for the highest altitude reached by female climbers and the largest number of climbers. We extend our warm congratulations to all the athletes of the mountaineering team, especially the female mountaineers, on their victory in scaling the peak.
    Mountaineering is an excellent sport. It can train people's physique, their excellent qualities of courage and perseverance, and their spirit of collectivism and patriotism. It can also broaden people's horizons, enrich their scientific knowledge, and support economic and national defense construction. Therefore, since 1955, more and more people have participated in mountaineering, and many young people from all walks of life have become active participants in this sport.
    Mountaineers must live, train, and conduct scientific research in the complex and ever-changing mountain environment, which inevitably presents various difficulties. They have to climb steep ice and snow slopes at different angles and various kinds of rocks; they also have to pass through dangerous "icefall" areas and narrow ridges and "snow bridges"; and fight against the constantly changing harsh climate such as strong winds, heavy snow, and sudden changes in temperature; they have to overcome the lack of oxygen in the high mountains and the strong ultraviolet reflection on the snow, and so on. Therefore, mountaineers must not only have an agile body, good endurance, and the ability to adapt to the mountain climate, but also have a highly courageous and tenacious spirit, a determination to overcome difficulties, and a united and friendly collectivist spirit. This cultivates the all-round development of communist moral qualities in mountaineers.
    Mountaineering is closely related to serving economic construction and conducting scientific research. During the mountaineering process, it is possible to investigate and collect valuable data on the geography, geology, landforms, meteorology, natural resources, and other aspects of various regions, which can be provided to scientific workers and economic construction for reference. Last year, our mountaineers closely cooperated with scientific workers to help them ascend Mount Jingtieshan in Gansu to investigate the distribution of iron ore in the mountain; and to help them investigate the distribution of glaciers in the Qilian Mountains. In these activities, mountaineers learned from scientific workers and enriched their relevant scientific knowledge; on the other hand, they popularized mountaineering techniques to scientific workers, enabling them to better complete work that they could not have done in the past.
    Our country is a mountainous country, and most of the world's peaks above 8,000 meters above sea level are in our country, but they have not yet been conquered by our mountaineers. The treasures on many of our high mountains have not yet been developed and utilized. This requires us to gain experience as soon as possible in climbing high mountains and conducting high-altitude scientific research, so that it will be possible to gradually conquer various famous mountains and peaks in the future. The main purpose of climbing Muztagh Ata Peak this time is to exercise people's physique and will, explore the secrets of high mountains, and engage in high-altitude scientific research; and to accumulate experience in climbing high mountains.
    We congratulate the victory of ascending Muztagh Ata Peak. We hope that the mountaineers will continue to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, carefully summarize our country's past mountaineering experiences, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, work hard, and strive for greater glory for the motherland.

### 祝贺攀登慕士塔格山顶峰的胜利

    祝贺攀登慕士塔格山顶峰的胜利
    中国男、女混合慕士塔格登山队三十三名年轻的男、女运动员，以无比的毅力，度过了重重难关，经过了几天的行军，终于在7月7日集体安全地登上了新疆西部拔海7546米的“冰山之父”——慕士塔格山顶峰，并创造了女子登山最高和人数最多的世界纪录。我们对登山队全体运动员、特别是女子登山运动员攀登高峰的胜利表示热烈祝贺。
    登山运动是一项很好的体育运动项目。它能够锻炼人们的体格、勇敢坚毅的优良品质和集体主义、爱国主义的精神，并且能够扩大人们的眼界，丰富人们的科学知识和支援经济建设、国防建设。因此，自1955年开始，参加登山运动的人越来越多，各行各业的广大青年中已有不少人成了这项运动的积极分子。
    登山运动员要在复杂多变的高山环境里生活、锻炼和进行科学研究工作，必然要碰到种种困难。他们要攀登不同角度的冰雪陡坡和各种各样的岩石；还要通过危险的“冰瀑”地区和狭窄的山脊、“雪桥”；并同大风大雪、忽冷忽热等变化无常的恶劣气候作斗争；要战胜高山缺乏氧气和在雪地上的紫外线强烈反射，等等。因此，登山运动员不仅要有灵敏的身体、良好的耐力和适应高山气候的本领，而且要有高度勇敢顽强的精神和克服困难的决心，以及团结友爱的集体主义精神。这就培养了登山运动员全面发展的共产主义道德品质。
    登山运动在为经济建设服务和进行科学研究方面，是有很密切的关系的。在登山过程中，可以调查、搜集各地区的地理、地质、地貌、气象、自然富源，以及其他方面的许多宝贵资料，供给科学工作者和经济建设作参考。去年，我国的登山运动员已经同科学工作者密切合作，帮助科学工作者登上了甘肃镜铁山，调查了这个山的铁矿分布情况；帮助科学工作者调查了祁连山的冰川分布情况。在这些活动中，登山运动员一方面向科学工作者学习，丰富了有关的科学知识；另一方面，他们把登山的技术普及到科学工作者中去，使科学工作者能更好地完成过去所不能完成的工作。
    我国是个多山的国家，世界上拔海八千米以上的高峰，大多数在我国，但它们还没有被我国登山运动员所征服。我国许多高山上的宝藏也还没有被开发利用。这就要求我们在攀登高山和在进行高山科学研究工作方面，尽快地取得经验，以便有可能在将来逐步地征服各个名山和高峰。这次攀登慕士塔格峰的主要的目的，就是锻炼人们的体格和意志，探索高山的秘密和从事高山科学研究工作；并积累攀登高山的经验。
    我们祝贺攀登慕士塔格山顶峰的胜利。我们希望登山运动员们要继续学习苏联的先进经验，认真总结我国历次的登山经验，戒骄戒躁，刻苦锻炼，为祖国争取更大的荣誉。
