This Newspaper, Lanzhou, 29th: The Chinese Communist Party's Jingchuan County Committee in Gansu Province, after achieving the first great summer harvest since communization, immediately applied the experience of summer field management to promote the management of autumn crops. They used the summer to drive the autumn, advancing victoriously, and raising the level of autumn field management step by step, with first- and second-class seedlings accounting for more than 90%. All 740,000 mu of autumn fields in the county have been weeded twice, and most have been weeded three times. The first topdressing has been applied, and the second is now beginning.

The main summer field crop in Jingchuan County is winter wheat. In order to achieve a bumper harvest of more than 1.2 million mu of winter wheat, the people of the county put in tremendous labor and gained rich experience. The most important reason for the great harvest of winter wheat this year is the implementation of a responsibility system in management, with production quotas assigned to groups and responsibilities assigned to individuals; payment according to labor, more pay for more work, and bonuses for exceeding production targets. These measures stimulated the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members for production. After the start of autumn field management, the county committee and the party committees of various communes and production teams first grasped this point. After the implementation of the contract responsibility system, the vast number of commune members were proactive and positive, and the old, weak, women, and children all participated in field management according to their abilities.

During the growth period of winter wheat this year, it suffered eight consecutive severe frost disasters, but all were overcome. The experience of large-scale joint prevention and control of winter wheat from frost damage has also blossomed and borne fruit in autumn field management. When cutworms, grubs, and other insect pests were found in more than 32,000 mu of autumn fields in Chengguan and other communes this year, the combination of large-scale joint encirclement and suppression and specialized team capture was used. More than 30,000 people fought for more than ten days, and all autumn crops were safe and sound, without damage.

Inspection, evaluation, and rewarding advanced workers, and encouraging backward workers, so that measures are continuously increased, is a common method used during winter wheat management. This experience is also often applied to autumn field management. Zhou Gairun of the Hougou Production Team of the Chaona Commune hoed more than five mu of weeds more than others within seven days and fertilized all the responsibility fields well, mainly because she was proactive, agile, diligent, and quick. After her deeds were rewarded and commended, they greatly encouraged the women commune members. (Wang Tiqiang)

    运用夏田经验　推动秋田管理
    泾川秋田管理水平步步上升
    本报兰州29日电　中共甘肃省泾川县委在取得公社化后第一个夏季大丰收以后，立即运用夏田管理工作的经验，推动秋田作物的管理工作，以夏促秋，乘胜前进，使秋田管理水平步步上升，秋田作物一、二类苗占90％以上。全县七十四万亩秋田已全部锄过两次草，大部已锄过三次草。第一次追肥已经施过，第二次正在开始。
    泾川县夏田作物主要是冬小麦。为了使一百二十多万亩冬小麦获得丰收，全县人民付出了巨大的劳动，取得了丰富经验。今年冬小麦获得大丰收的最重要原因，是管理上实行了责任制，包产到组，责任到人；按劳取酬、多劳多得和超产奖励。这些措施激发了广大社员对生产的积极性。秋田管理开始以后，县委和各公社、生产队党委就首先抓这一条。实行包产责任制以后，广大社员主动积极，老弱妇幼都各按所能参加田间管理。
    今年冬小麦生长期间，连续遭受八次严重霜冻灾害，但都被战胜了。大兵团联合防治冬小麦不受霜冻的经验，在秋田管理上也开了花结了果。当今年城关等公社三万二千多亩秋田里发现地老虎、蛴螬等虫害时，大兵团联合围剿和专业队捕捉相结合，三万多人经过十多天的奋战，全部秋作物安全无恙，未受损害。
    检查评比，奖励先进，激励后进，使措施不断加码，是冬小麦管理期间常用的方法。秋田管理也经常应用这个经验。朝那公社后沟生产队周改润七天内比别人多锄草五亩多，把责任田都施好肥，主要原因是她主动积极，手脚灵巧勤快。她的事迹受到奖励和表扬以后，对妇女社员的鼓励很大。（王体强）
