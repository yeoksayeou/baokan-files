Guangzhou Third People's Hospital has successfully treated breech presentation in pregnant women using acupuncture. Among the 27 cases tested, 22 have shown effectiveness. Acupuncture experts in Guangzhou believe that this treatment method is simple, safe, and yields quick results, possessing significant value in both medical academics and practical application. Currently, the hospital has taken X-ray photographs of many cases before and after acupuncture to document the fetal position changes, in order to conduct more in-depth analysis and research in medicine, further promote the precious medical heritage of our motherland, and serve human health.

The hospital began experimenting with acupuncture to treat breech presentation in pregnant women in June of this year. In the past month or so, a total of 27 cases have been treated, all of whom were more than seven months pregnant. After acupuncture treatment, excluding two cases with excessively small pelvises and one footling breech presentation that were ineffective, and two cases that only received one treatment and have not yet shown effectiveness, the fetal positions of the remaining 22 pregnant women quickly corrected themselves. Symptoms such as fetal movement and abdominal pain associated with breech presentation also disappeared, and there were no other side effects. During the treatment, only the "Zhiyin" acupoint (located near the tip of the little toe) was moxibusted, with each session lasting fifteen minutes. Among the 22 cases that have already shown effectiveness, 11 experienced miraculous results the day after only one acupuncture session, and seven showed effectiveness after two moxibustion sessions.

    广州市第三人民医院用针灸治胎位不正成功
    本报讯　广州市第三人民医院试用针灸治疗孕妇胎位不正成功。在试行的二十七个病例中，已有二十二个见效。广州市一些针灸专家认为，这种疗法简易、安全、收效快，在医学学术上和医疗实用上都有很大价值。目前，该院已经将许多病例在针灸前后胎位变动的情况，用X光摄成照片，以便在医学上作更深入的分析研究，进一步发扬祖国宝贵的医学遗产，为人类的健康服务。
    这个医院试用针灸治疗孕妇胎位不正，是在今年6月间才开始的。在这一个多月中，总共治疗了二十七个病例，都是怀孕七个月以上的。这二十七个孕妇经过用针灸治疗之后，除两个骨盆太小和一个足先露的灸治无效，两个只灸治过一次尚未见效的之外，其余二十二个孕妇的胎位都很快自行矫正了。因胎位不正伴随而来的胎动、腹痛等症状也一起消除了，而且也无其他副作用。灸治时，只灸“至阴”一穴（位置在脚小趾尖附近），每次悬灸十五分钟即成。在已经治疗见效的二十二个病例中，有十一个只经一次针灸，第二天就已立见神效；有七个经两次灸治就见效。
