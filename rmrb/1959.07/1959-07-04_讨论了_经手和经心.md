    Discussion on "Passing Through the Hands and Engaging the Mind"
    After our reading group at the Datong Railway Electrical Works Repair Shop read Comrade Liu Di's article "Passing Through the Hands and Engaging the Mind" on page 8 of our newspaper on June 9th, a discussion immediately broke out. Everyone felt that this article was educational for everyone in our repair shop. After some discussion, we felt that Zheng Xuzeng, a planer from Harbin who has not produced a single defective product in nine years, does so because he is focused and dedicated when working, truly establishing a master's attitude towards labor. In the past, some of our comrades were indeed not engaged enough in their work, were not careful enough, and were not focused enough during work, so they often produced defective products and had to rework. Everyone expressed that they must learn from comrades like Zheng Xuzeng and Lin Deshi. If they can do it, we can definitely do it too. Master Li is the comrade with the most rework in the entire workshop. Although he didn't say much during the discussion, the internal struggle was stronger than anyone else. Sure enough, the next day, the quality of his welding of triangular iron frames significantly improved. The facts reversed everyone's perception; in the past, the reason for many defective products was not because of low technical skills, but because of "passing through the hands without engaging the mind."

    讨论了“经手和经心”
    我们大同铁路电务段修缮所读报组读了咱报6月9日八版上柳笛同志写的“经手和经心”一文，立即议论开了，大家都认为这篇稿子对我们修缮所每个人都有教育意义。我们讨论了一下，觉得哈尔滨的刨工郑绪增九年不出一件废品，就因为他干活时专心一意，真正树立了主人翁的劳动态度。过去我们有些同志对工作的确是不够经心，干活不仔细，工作当中精神不集中，因此，常常出废品，返工。大家表示一定要向郑绪增、林德时等同志学习，他们能做到我们也一定能做到。李师傅是全所返工活最多的一个同志，讨论时他虽然发言不多，但心里的斗争比谁都强。果然第二  天他焊三角铁架子时，质量有显著提高。事实扭转了大家的认识，过去废品多不是因为技术低，而是“经手不经心”。
