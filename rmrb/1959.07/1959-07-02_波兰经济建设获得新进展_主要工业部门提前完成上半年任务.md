Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 1st: Poland's national economic construction has made significant progress in the first half of this year. Major industrial sectors have completed their first-half production tasks ahead of schedule.

On June 25th, the coal industry first reported good news, completing its production task for the first half of the year ahead of schedule, with an overproduction of nearly 1.45 million tons of coal. This brought Poland's coal production to over 49 million tons in the first half of the year. The chemical industry also completed its production plan for the first half of the year five days ahead of schedule, and by the end of June, had overproduced products worth more than 300 million zlotys for the country.

The production plans of the steel industry, power industry, and light industry were also completed very well. In the first six months of this year, Polish steel enterprises produced a total of more than 3 million tons of steel, exceeding the original national plan by 30,000 tons. The production plans for pig iron and steel products were also overfulfilled, with steel products alone exceeding the plan by approximately 36,000 tons. This year, Poland's capital construction tasks have increased significantly compared to the past two years; however, in the first five months, 34.5 percent of the annual capital construction task has already been completed, a higher indicator than in previous years.

What is particularly important is that the capital construction plans of major industrial sectors are being implemented smoothly. The country's largest Auschwitz Chemical Combine, Poland's first synthetic rubber factory, and many other mines and industrial projects have been put into production in the first half of the year. Due to the completion of the above two large-scale chemical industrial enterprises, Poland's chemical industry has begun to rank among the world's advanced.

In agriculture, Poland completed its spring planting plan almost a month ahead of schedule this year. In addition, it is worth noting that Poland has also made great efforts in developing agricultural mechanization and improving soil this year. In the first half of the year, agriculture received 11,000 harvesters and 4,900 hay balers, and soil improvement was carried out on hundreds of thousands of hectares of land. Although Poland has experienced a dry climate this year, crops are still expected to have a good harvest due to the above reasons.

    波兰经济建设获得新进展
    主要工业部门提前完成上半年任务
    新华社华沙1日电　今年上半年，波兰的国民经济建设又得到了长足的进展。各主要工业部门都提前完成了今年上半年的生产任务。
    6月25日，煤炭工业首传捷报，提前完成前半年的生产任务，超计划生产了将近一百四十五万吨煤。这使波兰煤炭工业今年上半年的产量达到了四千九百万吨以上。化学工业也提前五天完成了今年上半年的生产计划，到6月底，已为国家超额生产了价值三亿多兹罗提的产品。
    钢铁工业、动力工业和轻工业的生产计划也完成得很好。今年头六个月，波兰钢铁工业企业总共生产了三百多万吨钢，超过国家原订计划三万吨。生铁和钢材的生产计划也超额完成了，其中，单钢材就多生产了约三万六千吨。今年，波兰的基本建设任务比过去两年增加很多，然而，在头五个月中就已经完成了全年基本建设任务的百分之三十四点五，这个指标比过去几年的指标都要高。
    尤其重要的是，各主要工业部门的基本建设计划都在顺利地实现。全国最大的奥斯威辛化学联合企业，波兰第一个人造橡胶工厂以及其他许多矿井和工业项目都在头半年相继投入生产。由于上述两个大规模的化学工业企业的建成，波兰的化学工业已开始跃居世界前列。
    在农业方面，波兰今年差不多提前一个月完成了春播计划。此外，值得注意的是：今年以来，波兰在发展农业机械化和进行土壤改良方面也作了很大的努力。今年上半年，农业就得到了一万一千台收割机和四千九百台干草捆束机，进行了土壤改良的土地达几十万公顶。今年以来，波兰虽然气候干旱，但是由于以上原因，农作物仍然可望丰收。
