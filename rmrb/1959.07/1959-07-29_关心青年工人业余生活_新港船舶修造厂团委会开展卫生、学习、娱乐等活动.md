Caring for the Young Workers' Leisure Life
    Xingang Shipbuilding and Repair Factory's Youth League Committee Carries Out Activities Such as Hygiene, Learning, and Recreation

    According to the Tianjin Daily, the Communist Youth League Committee of Tianjin Xingang Shipbuilding and Repair Factory recently launched a "Five Goods" (hygiene, learning, culture and sports, unity and mutual aid, moral character) red flag competition in the new workers' dormitories, making the dormitories a position for conducting communist ideological education for new workers and a place for amateur cultural and recreational activities. The factory's Youth League organization's practice of caring for young workers in every possible way and helping them arrange their lives well is very popular among young workers.

    More than nine hundred new workers live in the factory's two buildings. They come from all over the country and have different living habits. As a result, many problems have arisen after a few months. Due to different shifts, some work day shifts, some work night shifts, some are two-shift production, and some are three-shift production. This affects each other's rest and has caused many disputes. At the same time, most of these new workers are young and lack life experience, and they do not know how to arrange their spare time well. After work every day, many people's leisure life is very irregular.

    The factory's Communist Youth League organization realized that caring for the young workers' leisure life was an important issue and promptly reported it to the factory's Party Committee. It was decided that, based on the principles of allowing young workers to rest well, have fun, work well, and conduct communist education for young workers, the dormitories were adjusted at the end of April according to workshops and work shifts. Group leaders were selected in each room. At the same time, the "Five Goods" red flag dormitory competition was launched by each workshop's Youth League branch, with monthly evaluations.

    The young workers' leisure life has gradually become regular and colorful. Each dormitory has established a "Five Goods" pact and a hygiene duty system. The vast majority of rooms are cleaned up neatly and tidily. The cultural life of young workers has also been developed. After work every night, some play musical instruments, some play cards and chess, and some gather in groups of three or five to listen to technicians tutoring theoretical lessons and reading newspapers collectively. Reading revolutionary story books, watching movies, and participating in ball games and other activities beneficial to physical and mental health have increased. Books such as "Song of Youth" and "Behind Enemy Lines Guerrilla Force" are very popular. Some time ago, the factory's Youth League organization recommended a book on how to be a Red Apprentice, and the five hundred copies brought from the Xinhua Bookstore were quickly sold out.

    Through these meaningful activities, the collective spirit of the young workers has been greatly strengthened. They work in a group during work hours and play and read together after work, establishing a deep friendship with each other. Many touching examples of comradely unity and mutual assistance have emerged. Some time ago, apprentice Wang Jinming's foot was swollen and painful, and apprentice Xu Shugui, who lived in the same room, carried him to the port hospital for treatment. The seventeen female casting apprentices who live here are a "Red Flag Girls Team" in production, and they actively help others in the dormitory. They take the initiative to help the male comrades wash their clothes when they see that they are dirty. Once, apprentice Meng Qingqi tore his pants while working, and he couldn't mend them himself. When the female apprentices learned about this, they immediately mended them for him overnight. In collective life, the new moral qualities of the young people are growing day by day, and helping others to learn culture and tutor technical lessons is even more commonplace. The secretary of the factory's Youth League Committee said: They are simply like real brothers and sisters.

    关心青年工人业余生活
    新港船舶修造厂团委会开展卫生、学习、娱乐等活动
    据天津日报消息　共青团天津新港船舶修造厂委员会，最近在新工人宿舍中开展了“五好”（卫生、学习、文体、团结互助、道德品质）红旗竞赛，使宿舍成为对新工人进行共产主义思想教育的阵地和业余文娱活动的场所。该厂团组织这种处处关心青年工人，帮助他们安排好生活的作法，很受青年工人欢迎。
    在这个厂的两幢楼房内，住着九百多名新工人。他们来自各地，生活习惯不同，因此，几个月之后，出现了不少问题。由于班次不同，一个屋内，有的上白班，有的上夜班，有的是两班生产，也有的是三班生产。这样，互相影响休息，也引起了不少纠纷。同时，这些新工人大部分都是青年，缺乏生活经验，业余时间不会很好地安排。每天下班后，许多人的业余生活很不规律。
    这个厂的共青团组织，认识到关心青年工人的业余生活是一个重要问题，及时向工厂党委做了汇报，决定本着让青年工人休息好、玩好、工作好和对青年工人进行共产主义教育的原则，在4月底按车间、工作班次调整了宿舍。各个房间内都选出了小组长。同时，以各车间团支部为单位，开展了“五好”红旗宿舍竞赛，每月按期评比。
    青年工人的业余生活，逐步变得有规律和丰富多彩。每个宿舍，都订立了“五好”公约和卫生值日制度。绝大多数的房间都收拾得干干净净、整整齐齐；青年工人的文化生活也开展了起来，每天晚上下班之后，有的玩乐器，有的打扑克、下象棋，还有的三五成群凑在一起，听技术员辅导理论课和集体读报。阅读革命故事书，看电影和进行球赛等，有益于身心的活动增多了。“青春之歌”、“敌后武工队”等书籍很受欢迎。前些日子，工厂团组织推荐了一本怎样做一个红色徒工的书，从新华书店拿来五百本，很快就卖光了。
    通过这些有意义的活动，使青年工人的集体主义思想大大加强。他们上班时工作在一个小组，下班后又在一块玩和读书，彼此之间建立了深厚的友谊，出现了很多同志式的团结互助的感人事例。前些日子，徒工王金铭的脚肿了，痛得不能支持，同屋住的徒工徐树贵就把他背到港口医院去治疗。在这里居住的十七名铸工女徒工，她们在生产上是一支“红旗姑娘队”，在宿舍内又积极帮助别人，看到男同志们的衣服脏了就主动帮着洗。有一次，徒工孟庆其在工作时将裤子划破了，自己又不会补，正在发愁的时候，女徒工们知道了这件事，马上连夜给他补好了。在集体生活中，青年们新的道德品质一天天成长，帮助别人学文化、补习技术课的事情更是屡见不鲜。这个厂团委书记说：他们简直像亲兄弟姐妹一样了。
