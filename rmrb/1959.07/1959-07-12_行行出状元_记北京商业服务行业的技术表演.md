    Every Trade Produces a Master
    —On the Technical Performances in Beijing's Commercial Service Industry
    Wu Dehua, Zhang Zhiqing, Zhou Dingfang
    The Beijing Working People’s Cultural Palace has been very lively these past two days. In this place of ancient cypresses and golden brilliance, people have enjoyed many wonderful performances of superb skill. These performances are not touching dramas, nor are they light and graceful dances, but the technical performances of more than 1,500 technical experts from the commercial and service industries of Beijing. Among these people are elderly men around fifty years old, as well as young men and women; the performance items are diverse and colorful, ranging from sales packaging to noodle cutting and stir-frying, from deboning meat and measuring cloth to hairdressing and photography, covering everything. During the two days of visits, we saw the exquisite skills that these people have honed through hard work day and night for the people, and we are filled with infinite gratitude and respect for them.
                One Wonton Per Second
    Wonton is a popular breakfast and late-night snack. But don't underestimate this small thing; it embodies exquisite skill.
    A young man's wonton-wrapping performance drew bursts of applause from the audience. He held a thick stack of wonton wrappers in his palm, using chopsticks in one hand to scoop the filling, and with a turn of his finger, he wrapped one wonton. The wontons popped out of his hand one after another like jumping fish. The eyes of the viewers could hardly keep up. The wonton wrappers are thin, and the filling is large, making it difficult to wrap well. Generally, technicians can only wrap forty or so per minute, but this young man wrapped an average of more than sixty per minute.
    This young man is named Chen Baozeng, and he is nineteen years old. He is an apprentice of Hou Tingjie, the famous Beijing "Wonton Hou" veteran technician. After he started working, he fell in love with this trade. He saw that the old method of wrapping wontons, with one hand holding the wrapper and the other scooping the filling, using both hands to wrap, was slow and laborious. Many people eat wontons, often waiting for a long time. This young man thought day and night about how to speed up the wrapping of wontons. Under the guidance of a famous teacher and through diligent practice, he gradually figured out the secret to speeding up. After his right hand scoops the filling, the middle finger of his left hand, holding the wonton wrapper, presses up, the chopsticks roll, and the thumb presses and pushes. In the blink of an eye, a wonton with a good appearance, accurate weight, and which does not break or fall apart after being cooked, is wrapped.
    Hou Tingjie, Chen Baozeng's master, who watched his performance on the spot, was so happy he couldn't close his mouth when he saw his apprentice being praised by the people like this. He praised his apprentice, saying: In the past, I used to cook only twenty or so bowls of wontons at a time, and it usually took two or three people to wrap them with me. Now, Little Chen can handle it alone, with plenty to spare.
                    Seamless
    Among the technical performance projects in the laundry and dyeing industry, the most eye-catching is the clothes-weaving and mending technique, because it is closely related to the daily lives of the broad masses of people.
    When people accidentally damage a beloved garment, whether it is moth-eaten, burned by a cigarette butt, or torn with a small opening, they are always very upset and feel particularly awkward. But as long as it is woven and mended, it can immediately be restored to its original state.
    In the weaving and mending technical performance, there was Huang Jinyuan, a technician from the Central Pland Laundry and Dyeing Store. He performed the weaving and mending of a piece of fine wool gabardine. After the weaving was completed, a careful inspection revealed it to be truly seamless. There were no traces on either side. Unless one was "eagle-eyed," it would be difficult to find the original hole.
    Weaving and mending is a very delicate craft. If the eyes and hands are not coordinated, and the needle is not accurately picked, traces will be left. There is a lot of knowledge involved here, requiring familiarity with the fiber structure of the material, accurate needle picking, and even and appropriate force. The most impressive skill is to weave and mend without leaving traces on either side. This is not something that ordinary technicians can do.
    Huang Jinyuan, who has been weaving and mending for twenty years, faced countless difficulties when mastering this unique skill. At that time, colleagues were enemies, and skilled people were unwilling to pass on their skills to others. Huang Jinyuan grew up by "stealing skills" on the side, exploring, and practicing hard. He would take apart clothes that other technicians had woven and mended to observe, ponder, and study them in detail. He continued to do this for many years, coupled with his own diligent practice, before mastering the "smooth on both sides" weaving and mending technique.
    This "seamless" clothes-mending expert now threads the needle day and night, weaving and mending one garment after another for the people.
                  One Cut Accurate
    In the technical performance room of the non-staple food and grain industry, two disguised "customers" were buying pork, one buying six liang and the other buying four liang. Du Yongjiang, a salesperson from the Hepingli Non-Staple Food Center Store in Dongcheng District, picked up a knife and, with two swift cuts, cut two portions of neat pork in twenty-two seconds; the audience weighed them, and the two portions of pork were neither more nor less, one six liang and one four liang.
    Pork has thick and thin parts, loose and tight parts, and it is not easy to be accurate in one cut. This Du Yongjiang, who is known as "one cut accurate," has only developed his skills in the last three years. In the past, when he sold pork, he was also inaccurate with one cut and off with two cuts, needing three cuts to get the amount right. He saw that customers waited a long time to buy, and he was very dissatisfied with his work speed, so he pondered the speed of cutting meat all day long. One day, he suddenly discovered the "secret." The main reason for not being fast enough was that the cut was not accurate with one knife. How can one cut accurately? Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it. After several years of research, he finally figured out the nature of pork, where it is thick, where it is thin, where the weight is heavy, and where the weight is light. Because he mastered the laws of pork, he is always accurate with one cut when selling pork now. Customers who are familiar with him trustingly say when they see that the meat seller is Du Yongjiang: "Don't weigh it, the meat you cut is correct!"
                  Beautifying Clothing
    This is an ironing performance. The technicians, holding irons heated by intense fire, skillfully iron back and forth. Clothes that were originally wrinkled and dull in color immediately became bright, smooth, and "spirited." The referees walked back and forth among the performers with stopwatches. After a match, he announced loudly: Technician Yang Qiwei ironed four collared shirts in twenty-two minutes and five seconds. Before his voice fell, a burst of warm applause rang out from the audience.
    Insiders tell us that ironing is a unique job in the laundry and dyeing industry, requiring heart, skill, and keen observation. Every second and every detail must be focused on, without the slightest negligence. A loss of seconds and details will cause irreparable losses.
    Everyone can iron clothes, but the subtleties are different. Skilled technicians have many details to pay attention to. Even when ironing an ordinary collared shirt, just one part of the collar needs to be ironed to be stiff, smooth, round, and shiny. When flicked with a finger, it makes a clanging sound. Only then will it be durable, and the collar will remain in its original shape until the next time it is washed, without changing shape. A set of woolen clothes, when ironed, brings out a natural and bright luster, with the silk and wool standing upright, as if with "strong bones," so that the trouser crease remains unchanged for a long time.
    The main tool for ironing clothes is the iron. Mastering the temperature of the iron requires a lot of hard work and practice. The hands of skilled technicians are as accurate as a "thermometer." As long as they hold the iron, they immediately know the exact temperature. Even more cleverly, they use the natural dissipation of temperature to correctly grasp the temperature resistance of the clothes, the order of precedence, and iron separately. When a garment is ironed well, the iron's temperature disappears, and the seams fit perfectly. This not only saves fuel but also reduces unnecessary movements, speeding up the ironing of clothes.
    In this technical performance, Wu Yongzeng, a technician from the Central Laundry and Dyeing Store, ironed a set of woolen uniforms in thirty minutes and fifty-six seconds; Chen Zhiyuan, a technician, ironed a pleated dance skirt in thirty minutes and fifty-five seconds. Their speed is twice as fast as that of ordinary technicians, and the quality is also good.
                May You Always Be Young
    In a barbershop with large glass windows, thirty barbers, holding combs, electric clippers, and hair dryers, carefully dressed up their customers as if they were crafting a work of art. After a while, the customers stood up from their chairs, looked in the mirror, showed a very satisfied expression on their faces, nodded to the barber comrades with a smile, and walked out of the performance room very handsome.
    Hairdressing is an art. A skilled hairdresser can create different hairstyles based on the customer's age, build, and face shape, making the customer look younger and more handsome. In the performance, Tian Yongyuan, a barber from the Silians Barber Shop, received a young customer with a thin face. When he was blow-drying the hair, he slightly puffed up the sideburns on both sides of the customer's head, and the hair in front was blown slightly lower and fluffy, forming a square-round shape. This hairstyle compensated for the defects of the thin cheeks. Cai Dexiang, a barber from the Xiangong Barber Shop, did the opposite. The customer he received was a fat man with a large scar on the back of his head. Based on his more than twenty years of hairdressing experience, he looked at it carefully for a while, then took the clippers and scissors and made the hair on top shorter and the sideburns on both sides tighter. The back was left thicker to cover the scar. When this customer saw in the mirror that his face looked more delicate and beautiful than before the haircut, he couldn't help but smile happily.
    In the other performance rooms, there were more than 180 jobs such as measuring cloth, counting paper, counting money, bookkeeping, weighing biscuits, deboning pork, opening eels, knife-cut noodles, and wrapping dumplings being competed in at the same time. The superb skills displayed by the masters also constantly aroused applause from the audience. People paid tribute to these ordinary and glorious service personnel.

    行行出状元
    ——记北京商业服务行业的技术表演
    巫德华　张志清　周定舫
    最近两天，北京劳动人民文化宫里非常热闹。在这个古柏参天金碧辉煌的场所，人们欣赏了很多技术高超的精彩表演，这些表演不是情节感人的戏剧，也不是轻盈优美的舞蹈，是北京全市的一千五百多位商业和服务行业的技术能手在这里表演。这些人中有五十岁上下的老人，也有年轻的小伙子和姑娘；表演的项目五花八门，丰富多彩，从售货包装到切面炒菜，从剔肉量布到理发照像，应有尽有。在两天的参观中，我们看到了这些人日夜为人们辛勤劳动而锻炼出来的精湛技术，对他们充满了无限的感激和敬意。
                一秒钟包一个馄饨
    馄饨是人们爱吃的早点、夜宵。可是，别看它是这么小的东西，却包含着精湛的技术。
    一个青年小伙子表演的包馄饨引起全场一阵阵的掌声，他手掌里放着厚厚的一叠馄饨皮，一手用筷子打馅，一手指头一转，就包好一个。馄饨像小鱼跳跃一样，一个又一个地从他手里蹦了出来，参观人的眼睛简直有点使唤不过来。馄饨皮薄、馅大，很不容易包好，一般技工在每分钟内，只能包四十多个，这个小伙子平均每分钟却包到六十多个。
    这个小伙子叫陈宝增，今年十九岁。是北京著名的“馄饨侯”老技师侯廷杰的徒弟。他参加工作后，就爱上了这一行。他看到旧的包馄饨方法，一手拿皮，一手打馅，两手包，又慢又费力气。吃馄饨的人很多，常常等候很长的时间。这个年青人就日夜思索，怎样才能加快包馄饨的速度呢？在名师的指点下，在实践中刻苦锻炼，逐步摸索出了加快速度的窍门，他右手打馅后，拿着馄饨皮的左手中指一顶，筷子一卷，大姆指一掯一推，?眼间就包成一个外形好看、份量准、下锅后不碎、不烂的馄饨。
    在场观看陈宝增表演的他的师傅侯廷杰，看到自己的徒弟受到人们这样的赞赏，高兴得合不拢嘴。他夸他的徒弟说：过去我煮馄饨，一次就二十来碗，一般要两三个人跟我包，现在小陈一个人顶下来，还富富余余。
                    天衣无缝
  洗染业技术表演项目中，最引人注意的是织补衣服技术表演，因为它同广大人民日常生活有着密切的联系。
    人们一件心爱的衣服，偶然不慎，保管不好，被虫子咬了，被烟头烧了，或者划破了一个小口子，心里总是十分懊恼，感到特别别扭，但是只要织补一下，立刻就能整旧如新。
  在织补技术表演中，有一位是中央普兰德洗染店的黄金元技师。他表演的是织补一块细毛哔叽，织完后，仔细观看，真是天衣无缝，两面不见痕迹，假如不是“明察秋毫”，是很难找到原来的破洞的。
    织补技术是一个很精细的手艺，眼手不到，挑针不准，就要留下痕迹。这里面的学问很多，既要熟悉质料的纤维组织，又要挑针准确，还要用力均匀，松紧合适。最见功夫的还是织补得两面不露痕迹。这不是一般技工所能做到的。
    为人织补二十年的黄金元，在掌握这门独特技巧的时候，真是千难万难。那时候，同行就是冤家，手艺高的人，不大肯把自己的技术传授给别人。黄金元是在一边“偷艺”，一边摸索，一边苦练中成长起来的。他把别的技师织好的衣服拆开来详细地观察、琢磨、研究，如此连续很多年，再加上自己刻苦锻炼，才掌握了“两面光”的织补技术。
    这位“天衣无缝”的补衣能手，现在日夜穿针引线，为人们织补一件又一件的衣裳。
                  一刀准
    副食、粮食业技术表演室内，有两位乔装的“顾客”买猪肉，一位买六两，一位买四两。东城区和平里副食品中心商店营业员杜永江拿起刀来，嚓嚓两下，在二十二秒钟内切了两份整整齐齐的猪肉；观众用秤一称，这两份猪肉不多也不少，一份六两，一份四两。
    猪肉有厚有薄，有松有紧，一刀就准，是不容易作到的。这个被人们称为“一刀准”的杜永江，他的技术是在最近三年内才锻炼出来的。过去他卖猪肉时，也是一刀不准两刀差，拉上三刀才顶数。他看到顾客候买的时间长，很不满意自己的工作速度，于是就整天琢磨切肉的速度。一天，他突然发现了“秘密”，原来速度不快的主要原因，是一刀下去，切得不准。怎样才能切得准呢？世上无难事，只怕有心人，经过几年的研究，他终于摸透了猪肉的性质，哪里厚，哪里薄，哪里分量重，哪里分量轻。由于他掌握了猪肉的规律，所以现在他在卖猪肉时，总是一刀准。熟悉他的顾客们，一见卖肉的是杜永江，就信赖地说：“别称了，你切的肉没错！”
                  美化衣着
    这是熨烫衣服表演，技师们手里拿着经过烈火烧热的烙铁，熟练地烫来烫去，原来绉折不堪、色泽灰暗的衣服，立刻明亮、平挺“精神”了。裁判员拿着跑表在表演者中间走来走去，一场比赛结束后，他高声宣布：杨琪有技师烫四件胶领衬衫，用了二十二分零五秒钟。他话音未落，观众中就响起了一阵热烈的掌声。
    内行人告诉我们，熨烫是洗染业中一个独特的工种，需要心灵、手巧，目察秋毫，一秒钟和一个细节，都要全神贯注，不能丝毫疏忽。分秒之失，就将造成难以挽回的损失。
    烫衣服，人人会烫，可是奥妙不同，高明的技师，都有很多讲究，就是烫一件普通胶领衬衫，光领子的一部分，就要烫得硬朗、平挺、形圆、光亮，手指一弹，锵锵有声。这样才有持久性，一直穿到下次洗换时，领子还保持原状，不走样。一套毛料衣服，烫出自然的鲜艳光泽，丝毛竖立发挺，好像带有“劲骨”，使裤线长期不变样。
    熨烫衣服的主要工具就是烙铁，掌握烙铁的温度，就得下一番苦学苦练的功夫。高明技师的手，真像“温度计”一样准确，只要拿着烙铁，立刻就知道准确的温度。更巧妙的，运用温度自然散失，正确掌握衣服耐温程度，先后次序，分别熨烫，一件衣服烫好，烙铁温度消失，合丝合缝，恰到好处。这不仅节省了燃料，也减少了不必要的动作，加快烫衣服的速度。
    在这次技术表演中，中央洗染店吴永增技师以三十分五十六秒烫完一套毛料制服；陈智远技师以三十分五十五秒，烫完一件带折舞裙。他们的速度，要比一般技工快一倍，质量也好。
                愿君青春常在
  在一间镶嵌着大玻璃的理发室里，三十个理发员拿着木梳、电推刀和吹风机，像琢磨一件艺术品似地，细心地给顾客打扮着。不一会功夫，顾客们从椅子上站起来，对着镜子照照，脸上显出非常满意的神气，笑着向理发员同志点点头，就十分英俊地走出表演室。
    理发是一门艺术，高明的理发师能够根据顾客的年龄、胖瘦和脸型，理出不同的发型，使顾客显得年青而英俊。在表演中，四联理发馆的理发员田永源接待了一位脸型瘦的青年顾客。他在吹风时，把顾客头部两边的鬓角吹得微微鼓起，前面的头发吹得稍低而带蓬松，形成方圆形的状态。这种发型弥补了面颊瘦的缺陷。仙宫理发馆的理发员蔡德祥恰恰相反，接待的顾客是一位胖子，头部后面还有一个大疤。他根据自己二十多年的理发经验，稍为端详一会，就拿着推子和剪刀，把上面的头发取得短一些，两边鬓角包得稍紧。后部留得厚一些，把疤掩盖起来。这位顾客从镜子中，看到自己的脸型显得比理发前清秀而漂亮时，禁不住高兴地笑了起来。
    在其他几个表演室里，还有量布、数纸张、点钞、算账、称包饼干、剔猪肉、鳝鱼开膛、刀削面、包饺子等一百八十多个工种同时进行了比赛，能手们表演的精湛技术，也不断引起观众们的掌声。人们向这些平凡而光荣的服务人员致敬。
