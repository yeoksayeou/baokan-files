Xinhua News Agency, Athens, 13th (TASS) -- The Athens Military Court, during the trial of national hero Glezos and other defendants on the morning of the 13th, concluded the defense's cross-examination of the plaintiff's witness, police officer Sakellariou, and began hearing testimony from defense witnesses.

Today, after analyzing the testimonies of the police officers and comparing them with the facts, the defense revealed that the political police bureau attempted to fabricate pretexts to persecute Glezos under Law No. 375. The "reason" manufactured by the police bureau was that Glezos provided shelter for Koliagiannis, a representative of the Greek Communist Party, thereby "assisting Koliagiannis in espionage activities." Although the police officers' statements were extremely contradictory, even conflicting with each other, the court president still supported the police bureau's slander.

Evidently, the judges of the military court, not believing that they could prove that Glezos and other democrats were guilty of "espionage activities" based on the doubtful oral testimonies of the police officers exposed by the defense, and fearing new exposures, turned to reading written testimonies of the plaintiff's witnesses in court. The defendants' defense lawyers strongly protested this method of "testimony," pointing out that, according to Greek criminal procedure law, written testimonies are only allowed in cases of death, mental illness, or serious illness. However, all the witnesses providing written testimonies were alive and well. Although the court president desperately tried to obstruct the defense, he was finally forced to allow oral questioning of these witnesses later.

Those present waited for the defense lawyers to speak. It was later learned that the number of defense witnesses was over one hundred. Some well-known politicians, social figures, lawyers, and businessmen who testified today spoke about the patriotic activities of Glezos, who was falsely accused of "espionage." The court president asked them: Do you believe that the defendant you are defending would engage in espionage activities? The witnesses firmly replied: "I do not believe so." The defense witnesses' testimony today struck a blow against the slanders made against socialist countries in court. The court president could not hide his annoyance and rudely interrupted the defense lawyers, forbidding them from defending the Greek Communist Party. Defense lawyer Iliou strongly protested this action by the court president.

The court president's actions created a very bad impression, and even the prosecutor, considering the presence of representatives of world public opinion, had to advise the president to "calm down."

According to a report in "Independent News" based on reliable sources, Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis, alarmed by the failure of the Glezos trial, is preparing to dismiss the Deputy Minister of Public Order and Security, Karanzis, "because Karanzis is considered the main person responsible for the failed trial." According to press reports, Karamanlis is dissatisfied that "the security department has shown completely inexcusable recklessness, indicating that it was completely unprepared for such a major trial, and in this trial, it is only desperately building accusations on conjecture, suspicion, and speculation... without providing any material that can be used as a basis for accusing the crime of espionage."

The newspaper pointed out that the Greek government is uneasy because the trial conducted by the military court has disgraced Greece in the face of world opinion. However, the newspaper pointed out, the Greek government still intends to pursue the trial to the end.

    希腊军事法庭的丑剧越演越丑
    “证人”不敢当面对质　庭长理屈词穷大发雷霆
    首相因为审讯丢尽了政府的脸要将负责人撤职
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社雅典13日讯：雅典军事法庭在13日上午对民族英雄格列索斯和其他被告的审讯中，结束了辩护人对原告证人警官萨凯拉里乌的质问，开始由辩护人作证。
    辩护人今天在分析了警察局警官的证词、并把这些证词同事实比较以后揭露，政治警察局企图想尽方法制造出可以采用第三百七十五号法律来迫害格列索斯的借口，警察局制造的“理由”是，格列索斯为希腊共产党代表科里雅尼斯提供避难所，从而“帮助了科里雅尼斯进行间谍活动”。虽然警察局警官的供词极其矛盾，甚至互相抵触，但是法庭庭长依然支持警察局的诬告。
    显然，军事法庭的法官，由于不相信能够根据已被辩护人揭露的那些令人怀疑的警察局警官口头证词来证明格列索斯和其他民主人士犯有“间谍活动”罪，并且耽心遭到新的暴露，于是转而在法庭上宣读原告证人的书面证词。被告的辩护律师表示坚决抗议这种“作证”方法，并且指出，根据希腊刑事诉讼法，书面证词只允许在死亡、精神病或患重病的情况下采用。然而，提供书面证词的所有证人全都活着，并且很健康。法庭庭长虽然拼命要阻挠辩护，但终于被迫允许以后对这些证人进行口头讯问。
    到庭的人等待辩护人的发言。而后来知道，辩护证人的数目竟在一百人以上。今天提出证词的一些著名的政治家、社会人士、律师、商人都谈到了被诬告犯有“间谍罪”的格列索斯的爱国活动。法庭庭长问他们：你是否相信你所辩护的被告会进行间谍活动？证人坚定地回答说：“我不相信”。辩护人的证词今天给了法庭上对社会主义国家进行的诬蔑以打击。法庭庭长不能掩饰自己的恼怒，粗暴地打断了辩护人的话，他禁止替希腊共产党辩护。辩护人伊利乌坚决抗议法庭庭长这种行动。
    法庭庭长的行动引起了非常不好的印象，甚至检察官也由于考虑到有世界公众的代表在座，而不得不劝告庭长“冷静一些”。
    据“独立新闻报”根据可靠消息报道，希腊首相卡拉曼利斯由于对格列索斯审讯的失败感到惊慌，准备撤去公共秩序和治安副大臣卡兰齐斯的职务，“因为卡兰齐斯被认为是遭到失败的审讯的主要负责人。”据报刊消息，卡拉曼利斯不满意的是，“治安部表现了完全不可原谅的轻率，表明它对这样重大的审讯完全没有准备，而在这一审讯中，只是拼命把控告建筑在猜想、怀疑、推测上……而没有提出任何材料可以作为控告犯间谍罪的根据。”
    报纸指出，希腊政府感到不安的是，军事法庭所进行的审讯使希腊在世界舆论面前名声扫地了。但是，报纸指出，希腊政府仍然要审讯到底。
