The Chengguan, Xiaoqiao, and Gaoxia communes in Xinzheng County, Henan Province, mobilized canteen staff to improve canteen hygiene, greatly reducing the incidence of summer gastrointestinal infectious diseases, ensuring the health of commune members, and improving labor efficiency.

During the summer harvest and planting season, the Party committees of these communes further strengthened their leadership over public canteens. First, they provided hygiene education to the cooks, helping them establish various hygiene systems to maintain consistent canteen hygiene.

In the canteens of production teams such as Wu Zhuang, Zhang Zhai, and Longwang Tieli in Gaoxia Commune, cooks were mobilized to make their own fly-proof, rat-proof, and dust-proof tools. Water tanks, flour tanks, and soup tanks all had lids. Cooked food was covered with gauze. Cooking utensils were washed thoroughly and regularly. Bowls and chopsticks were boiled and disinfected once a week. The cooks devised various methods to ensure that commune members regularly ate fresh vegetables and had access to sufficient boiled water to prevent them from getting sick from drinking cold water.

In addition to consistently paying attention to food hygiene, the cooks in the Wu Zhuang canteen also converted the two small windows of the canteen into four large windows to improve air circulation. The walls inside the house were also newly plastered, and the stoves were improved, greatly changing the hygienic appearance of the kitchen. The Zhang Zhai canteen even made a foot-operated fan to prevent cooks from suffering heatstroke. The canteens also promptly disposed of sewage, garbage, and slag, and regularly maintained the cleanliness of the canteens.

    食堂夏季卫生搞得好
    肠胃病大大减少
    河南新郑县城关、小乔和高夏等公社，发动炊事员搞好食堂卫生，使夏季肠胃传染病的发病率大大下降，保障了社员身体健康，提高了劳动效率。
    这几个公社的党委，在夏收夏种期间都进一步加强了对公共食堂的领导。首先对炊事人员进行卫生教育，帮助他们制定了各种卫生制度，使食堂卫生保持经常化。
    高夏公社的吴庄、张寨、龙王铁李等生产队的食堂，都发动炊事人员自制了防蝇、防鼠、防尘工具；水缸、面缸、汤缸都有盖子；饭菜做熟后都罩上纱罩；炊事用具经常洗刷得干干净净；碗筷每周煮沸消毒一次。炊事员想了各种办法来保证社员们经常吃新鲜蔬菜，并供应足够的开水，以免社员喝冷水生病。
    吴庄食堂的炊事员，除了经常注意饮食卫生外，还把食堂的两个小窗户改成了四个大窗户，使空气更加流通；屋内墙壁也粉刷一新，并且改进了锅灶，厨房的卫生面貌大大改观。张寨食堂为了防止炊事员中暑，还自制了一种脚踏风扇。各食堂对于污水、垃圾、炉渣也及时处理，经常保持食堂清洁。
