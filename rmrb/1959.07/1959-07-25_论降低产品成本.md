On Reducing Product Costs
Xu Yi, Dai Yuanchen

Product cost is composed of wages and the value of raw materials consumed, fixed asset depreciation, etc. The reduction of product cost reflects the improvement of labor productivity, the saving of raw material consumption, and the increase of fixed asset utilization. Ultimately, it is the saving of labor time, that is, creating more national income and accumulating more construction funds with the same amount of labor expenditure.

In 1958, the production costs of state-owned enterprises in our country were greatly reduced. The comparable product costs of industrial enterprises directly under the central industrial departments decreased by 12.5% compared with the previous year. If the funds saved by state-owned enterprises in 1958 due to cost reductions were used for capital construction, it could build nine iron and steel complexes with an annual output of 1.5 million tons of steel, or 160 new-type textile factories with 100,000 spindles and 4,000 looms. In 1959, a massive mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy has been launched nationwide, which will inevitably help to further improve business management, tap internal potential, and make full and rational use of human, material, and financial resources to reduce costs more quickly.

Reducing the production cost of products embodies the "saving" aspect of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. It is a unified whole that is interconnected and interdependent with increasing the quantity of products and improving product quality. When carrying out the vigorous movement of increasing production and practicing economy, we must comprehensively implement the general line of building socialism.

Reducing the production cost of products means reducing the consumption of labor in production. Its main ways are: improving labor productivity, improving the utilization rate of machinery and equipment, and saving the consumption of raw materials. And these are precisely the main ways to increase the quantity of products produced. Because the saving of labor consumption in production means producing more products with the same amount of materialized labor and living labor. Therefore, reducing the production cost of products and increasing the quantity of products produced are also interdependent and interconnected.

The Relationship Between Reducing Costs and Increasing Output

Practice over the past few years has proved that a substantial reduction in production costs always occurs simultaneously with a high-speed increase in production. This is not only because the growth of production can reduce the fixed cost of unit products (depreciation and business management expenses are relatively stable; as the number of products produced increases, the expenses allocated to each unit product decrease), thereby reducing costs; more importantly, production cannot grow rapidly without improving labor organization, improving labor proficiency, vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, and improving the utilization rate of fixed assets. Therefore, the extent of production cost reduction in the past few years has generally been commensurate with the situation of production growth. In 1956, production developed rapidly, and the production cost of comparable products in industrial enterprises nationwide decreased by 8.08% compared with the previous year; in 1957, the rate of production growth was lower than in 1956, and the reduction in costs was only 4.16%; in 1958, production leaped forward, and the production cost of products was greatly reduced. In the construction industry, for every additional 1 million yuan of production tasks completed, costs can generally be reduced by about 200,000 yuan due to reduced overhead expenses and avoidance of idle labor losses. Other economic sectors have similar situations.

The significance of productive labor is to transform one use value into another use value, such as spinning cotton into yarn, weaving it into cloth, and making clothes; refining iron ore and coal into pig iron, then into steel, and making machines, and so on. The production of any product inevitably involves the consumption of another product. Even in agricultural planting and mining, where the objects of labor are directly land and natural mineral resources, it is still necessary to consume seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools, and pit props and mining machinery. However, people require that the value of newly produced products be greater than the value consumed, which is considered a real increase in production.

An enterprise can increase production by improving labor productivity and saving raw material consumption, or it can increase production by increasing the number of laborers and using good materials and more raw materials. Therefore, increasing output does not necessarily lead to a reduction in production costs, and it may also increase production costs. Conversely, focusing solely on saving raw material consumption can lead to the production of more products with the same amount of raw materials, or it may lead to a reduction in the quantity of products produced in the same amount of production time. For example, cable factories that use positive tolerance for lead plating of cables have high output, but the consumption of raw materials per unit product is large. If negative tolerance is used to save raw material consumption, it will reduce output. Bearing factories that use stamping to manufacture steel balls will expand the die cavity if the stamping die time is extended, consuming more raw materials; however, the time to replace a die will result in 20,000 fewer sets of steel balls being produced. Textile factories that mix more inferior cotton, fly waste, and sweepings cannot speed up the machines. All of these indicate that increasing the quantity of products and reducing production costs are sometimes contradictory.

Because increasing the quantity of products and reducing production costs are sometimes contradictory, we must never adopt a "single fight" approach to organizing production, and we must never only ask how much labor has been accomplished without considering how much labor has been consumed; nor can we only talk about saving labor consumption without asking how much labor has been accomplished. At present, a few enterprises have a tendency to neglect economic accounting and disregard cost consumption, thinking that it does not matter if costs are higher as long as the production task is completed. This situation must be corrected. However, while advocating reducing production costs, we must also prevent the bias of not daring to actively increase production for fear of increasing production costs. The contradiction between increasing output and reducing costs can be resolved through technological reforms. In 1958, many textile enterprises experienced increased consumption of machine materials and increased costs in the early stages of speeding up the machines, and cotton slivers stuck to rollers, steel wire cotton webs were uneven, there were many broken ends, and there was much waste. However, after corresponding technological reforms, uniformizing devices and anti-sticking devices were added to the opening machines, and the problem of cotton slivers sticking to rollers was solved; the speed of the cylinder was increased to enhance the carding effect; baffles and automatic cleaner were added to the spinning frames to reduce broken ends, and the technological operations were improved. As a result, the consumption of machine materials and raw materials returned to normal, achieving high output and greatly reducing production costs.

When a contradiction arises between increasing the quantity of products and reducing production costs, we must determine the policy based on the specific situation. For certain products that are of great significance to the development of the national economy, we should first do our best to solve the problem of having or not having, of enough or not enough; on this basis, we should then consider how to reduce production costs. Because the development process of anything is from nothing to something, gradually improving, and the production cost of products is also gradually reduced. Although the cost of trial-producing new products is higher, we should not give up trial production because of this, otherwise we will never be able to produce new products. The superiority of the socialist system is precisely manifested in the fact that economic accounting breaks through the narrow scope of individual enterprises and takes whether it is beneficial to the entire national economy as a prerequisite. Therefore, enterprises with high costs will not be squeezed out by enterprises with low costs, and they can also subsidize certain temporarily loss-making products from the "advanced" profit-making perspective. However, it is also incorrect to exaggerate "having is better than not having" to the point of completely disregarding production costs. During the trial production period of new products, we still need to carry out technological reforms, strengthen management, and try to prevent waste. After successful trial production and formal production, we must gradually reduce production costs. If the production cost of refining one ton of iron exceeds the price of one ton of steel, we cannot say "having is better than not having," because the materials consumed are likely far greater than the materials produced. At this time, production cost becomes the main problem; this aspect of the problem must be solved in order for production to advance.

Reducing product production costs and improving product quality are also inseparable.

The Relationship Between Reducing Costs and Improving Quality

Reducing product costs is the requirement of "saving," and improving product quality is the requirement of "good." "Good" and "saving" are dialectically unified. If the quality of products produced with the same amount of production cost is good, for example, a pair of boots and shoes can last twice as long, a machine tool can be used as two, and the lighting time of a dry battery is doubled, this is actually equivalent to reducing production costs by half. If the shoes produced are "Sunday shoes," the socks are "street-pass socks," and the lighting time of dry batteries is shortened from 500 minutes to 100 minutes, then, although the production cost of the unit product has not increased or even decreased, the decline in product quality is actually equivalent to a reduction in the quantity of products. Five poor-quality dry batteries are only equivalent to the lighting time of one good-quality dry battery. Unless the production cost of poor-quality dry batteries is equivalent to or lower than one-fifth of the production cost of good-quality dry batteries, the production cost required for dry batteries to emit light for 500 minutes is actually increasing rather than decreasing. Therefore, in a certain sense, improving product quality is reducing production costs.

However, there are also contradictions between "good" and "saving." In the production of some products some time ago, processes were simplified, technological processes were changed, work hours were saved, and production costs were reduced. Although the achievements were great, some of them were affected by product quality due to excessive simplification. Some save limited work hours but have a significant impact on quality. For example, not oiling bearings affects machine operation and accelerates machine wear. Some also lower product quality due to the lack of raw materials and materials, the vigorous saving of raw materials and materials, the use of inferior raw materials, or the use of substitutes.

Because there are still contradictions between "good" and "saving," some comrades feel that "one cannot have both fish and bear's paw," that one cannot save if one wants to be good, and one cannot be good if one wants to save. This view is incorrect. In fact, it is only meaningful to compress work hours and save raw material consumption on the premise of ensuring quality; otherwise, it will outweigh the gains. To make product quality good, it is not necessary to consume more work hours, but it is only impossible to arbitrarily simplify necessary processes and cannot arbitrarily disrupt the normal order of production. Products of good quality do not necessarily have to consume more raw materials and materials than products of poor quality. Sometimes, the quality of products will decrease if more raw materials and materials are used. Letterpress printing paper weighs 52 grams per square meter, and the quality is excellent. If more pulp is used to make the weight reach more than 60 grams, the paper will be too thick and the quality will decrease instead. It can be seen that to ensure and improve product quality, it is not necessary to increase costs.

Caring about product quality and reducing production costs on the basis of ensuring and improving quality is of more important practical significance in China today. Reducing the rate of waste and defective products and reducing rework and repairs are one of the main ways for many factories and enterprises in China to reduce product costs. In the construction industry, some buildings have to be reworked and repaired because the quality of the project was reduced during the construction process, causing great waste; in some machinery factories, the scrap rate of castings reaches more than 30%, and the precision and efficiency of the finished products are poor, so they have to be reworked and repaired, or even scrapped, which will increase production costs. In light industry, the size of the damage rate is often the key issue that increases or decreases the production cost of many enterprises. It can be seen that promoting the vast number of employees to care about product quality, strengthening the inspection of semi-finished products and work in progress during the production process, preventing rework after completion, and strengthening technical management systems and production management systems, opposing those blind compression of work hours and saving of raw materials that are sufficient to reduce product quality, thereby reducing the rate of waste and defective products, it is possible to reduce production costs on the basis of ensuring and improving quality, and one can have both fish and bear's paw.

Reducing Costs Should Also Pay Attention to Long-Term and Overall Economic Benefits

To comprehensively implement the general line of building socialism by going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results, we must not only pay close attention to increasing output and improving quality while vigorously reducing production costs, but also achieve: taking into account today's production and tomorrow's production; taking into account both local economic effects and overall economic interests; caring about both production and the lives of the masses.

Today's production and tomorrow's production are closely related. It is of course a very good thing that we have increased the utilization rate of fixed assets in order to increase output, reduce costs, and achieve the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy. For example, in the textile sector, the front roller speed of the spinning frame has been increased from more than 200 revolutions to 300 or even 400 revolutions, and the speed of the machine has been increased; in the highway transportation sector, double-shift transportation has been implemented, and the maintenance time has been extended; in the power sector, operation beyond the nameplate has been implemented, and some power generation output has even exceeded 30% of the equipment nameplate, and so on. However, increasing the utilization rate of fixed assets will inevitably accelerate equipment wear. Therefore, we must pay attention to equipment protection and maintenance, otherwise equipment damage will accelerate. From today's point of view, it has increased output and reduced costs; but from a long-term point of view, it may be scrapped early, reduce output, and increase costs. Moreover, failure to pay attention to equipment protection and maintenance can easily lead to accidents. The power sector generates a few more kilowatt-hours today, and tomorrow, due to equipment damage, there is a sudden power outage. The blast furnace will have to solidify the molten iron due to the inability to continue to supply heat, and must be demolished and rebuilt; the printing and dyeing factory will have to mold the cloth because it cannot be washed and dried after dyeing, causing great economic losses. It can be seen that while improving the utilization rate of equipment, we should strengthen the protection and maintenance of equipment.

While vigorously reducing production costs, we must both pay attention to local economic interests and obey overall economic interests. The development of the entire national economy and the increase of national income are based on the increase of production, reduction of costs, and increase of profits by various enterprises. The overall economic interests are consistent with the local economic interests. However, the overall economic interests and local economic interests may sometimes conflict. This requires starting from the overall economic interests and temporarily abandoning local economic interests. For example, in the production of machinery, if it is produced in batches and in large quantities, output can be increased and production costs can be reduced. However, only paying attention to batch and large-scale production and delaying the delivery time may hinder the matching of machinery and equipment, thereby affecting the construction progress and the time of putting it into production, so that the steel plant has installed a converter, but cannot refine steel into materials due to the lack of a steel rolling mill, so that the power plant has installed a boiler, steam turbine, and generator, but cannot supply power due to the lack of a transformer. In order to deliver on time according to the plan, the machinery factory must produce in batches. Although this may make the reduction of production costs smaller, it is conducive to the development of the entire national economy. Therefore, the perspective of cost accounting cannot be limited to the scope of an enterprise, but must also have a global perspective and obey the interests of the entire national economy.

The same is true in the allocation and supply of raw materials between regions and enterprises, organizing collaborative production, and completing product plans. Cotton-producing areas are willing to keep good cotton for local enterprises to use, but transporting good cotton to Shanghai; can spin fine yarn of 120 or even 200 counts, and the economic benefits obtained by the country are greater; completing the collaborative production task may cause some trouble to the enterprise in organizing production, but the other party can benefit; comprehensively completing the product plan may not be conducive to the enterprise's expertise, and may also produce some products with small output value, labor-intensive, high-cost, and low-profit products, but it ensures market supply and meets the needs of all aspects. When encountering these situations, the interests of increasing production and practicing economy in this region and this enterprise should be subordinated to the requirements of the national plan.

While vigorously reducing production costs, we must care about both production and people, and care about the lives of the masses. Improving labor productivity is an important aspect of reducing production costs, but we should not rely on excessively increasing labor intensity to improve labor productivity, but should use our brains more in terms of technological innovation and technological revolution. Saving expenses is an important aspect of reducing production costs, but we must never save on the necessary labor protection, safety equipment, and welfare and health expenses because of practicing economy. This is not only because excessive increases in labor intensity and reductions in necessary labor protection and welfare and health expenses may lead to a decrease in the attendance rate of enterprise employees, which is not conducive to labor force allocation and labor organization, and ultimately cannot improve labor productivity. More importantly, the purpose of developing production under the socialist system is to better meet people's needs. At the same time, only by caring about people, caring about the lives of the masses, and caring about safe production can we better play the role of people and make production develop at a high speed.

In order to strive for the continued great leap forward of the national economy, we must conscientiously carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy and vigorously reduce the production cost of products. However, reducing the production cost of products is only one aspect of organizing enterprise production, namely, reducing the consumption of living labor and materialized labor; and all aspects of enterprise production are interconnected and interdependent unified whole. Moreover, with the continuous development and changes of conditions, the relationship between all aspects is also developing and changing, which requires us to prevent one-sidedness in our work and prevent the tendency of "single fight." Only caring about one aspect and not asking about the rest will turn correct things into wrong things. Therefore, organizing enterprise production must start from all aspects, and cannot be considered in isolation only from the quantity, cost, quality, etc. of products. Only by comprehensively implementing the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results can we better organize the continued leap forward of production.

    论降低产品成本
    许毅　戴园晨
    产品成本是由工资和耗用的原材料价值、固定资产折旧等构成的。产品成本的降低反映劳动生产率的提高、原材料消耗的节约、固定资产利用率的提高。归根到底，是劳动时间的节约，也就是用同样多的劳动耗费，创造出更多的国民收入，积累更多的建设资金。
    在1958年，我国国营企业生产成本有了大幅度的降低，中央各工业部直属工业企业的可比产品成本比上年降低12.5％。如果把1958年国营企业因为成本降低而节约的资金，用之于基本建设，可以建设九个年产一百五十万吨钢的钢铁联合企业，或者建设一百六十个拥有十万纱锭、四千台布机的新型纺织厂。1959年已经在全国范围内掀起了声势浩大的群众性的增产节约运动，这必然有利于进一步改善经营管理，挖掘内部潜力，充分合理地使用人力、物力、财力，更迅速地降低成本。
    降低产品生产成本，体现了多快好省的建设方针的省的方面，它和增加产品数量，提高产品质量，都是互相关联、互相依存的统一体。在轰轰烈烈地开展增产节约运动的时候，必须全面地贯彻多快好省的建设方针。
    降低产品的生产成本，是要减少生产中劳动的消耗。它的主要途径是：提高劳动生产率、提高机器设备利用率、节约原材料消耗等。而这也正是增加产品生产数量的主要途径。因为生产中劳动消耗的节省，就是用同样多的物化劳动和活劳动生产更多的产品。所以，降低产品生产成本同增加产品生产数量，也是互相依存、互相关联的。
    降低成本和提高产量的关系
    几年来的实践证明，凡是生产成本的大幅度降低，总是同生产的高速度增长同时出现。这不仅因为生产的增长，可以使单位产品的固定费用减少（折旧费和企业管理费是比较稳定的，生产的产品增加了，分摊到每一单位产品上的这些费用即减少），从而降低了成本；更重要的是如果不从改善劳动组织，提高劳动熟练程度，大闹技术革新和技术革命，提高固定资产利用率等方面入手，生产是不可能迅速增长的。所以，几年来生产成本降低的幅度，一般和生产增长的情况相适应。1956年生产发展快，全国工业企业可比产品生产成本较上年降低8.08％；1957年生产增长的速度比1956年低了一些，成本降低的幅度只有4.16％；1958年生产大跃进，产品的生产成本有了大幅度的降低。在建筑业中，每多完成一百万元的生产任务，由于少开支间接费用和避免窝工损失，使成本一般可以降低二十万元左右。其它经济部门都有类似情况。
    生产劳动的意义，是使一种使用价值转化为另一种使用价值，比如把棉花纺成纱、织成布、做成衣服；把铁矿石和煤炭炼成生铁，再炼成钢，做成机器，等等。任何一种产品的生产，都必然有另一种产品的消耗，即使是农业种植和矿山采掘，劳动对象直接是土地和天然矿源，也还是要消耗种子、肥料、农具和坑木、矿山机器的。但是人们要求新生产出的产品的价值，大于所消耗的价值，这才算真正增加了生产。
    一个企业可以从提高劳动生产率节省原材料消耗来增产，也可以从增加劳动者人数和使用好料、多用原材料来增产，因此增加产量，不一定会带来生产成本的降低，也有可能使生产成本提高。反过来，仅仅从节省原材料消耗着眼，可以用同样多的原材料生产更多的产品，也可能使同样多的生产时间内所生产的产品数量减少。例如，电缆厂电缆镀铅用正公差产量高，而单位产品原材料消耗量大，如果为节省原材料消耗而改用负公差，就会使产量降低。轴承厂用冲压法制造滚珠，冲压用的胎模时间拉长，模膛便会扩大，多耗用原材料；而换一次胎模的时间，则要少生产两万套滚珠。纺织厂多掺用次棉，皮辊花、落地棉，就不能加快车速。这些都表明，增加产品数量和降低生产成本，有时候是矛盾的。
    正因为增加产品数量和降低产品成本有时候有矛盾，所以，我们组织生产决不能够单打一，决不能够只问劳动成果有多少，不顾劳动消耗了多少；也决不能够只讲节省劳动消耗，不问劳动成果有多少。目前有少数企业有忽视经济核算、不讲成本耗费的倾向，以为只要完成生产任务，成本高一些无所谓，这种情形是要纠正的。但是，在提倡降低生产成本的同时，还必须防止因为怕生产成本提高，而不敢积极增产的偏向。增加产量和降低成本的矛盾，可以通过技术改革来解决。1958年很多纺织企业在加快车速的初期，机物料消耗增加，而且棉卷粘卷，钢丝棉网不匀，断头多，回花多，成本曾经一度上升。但是经过相应的技术改革，清花加了均匀装置和防粘装置，棉卷粘卷问题解决了；钢丝加快了锡林速度，增强了分梳作用；细纱加装了档板和车面自动清洁器，减少了断头，并且改进了工艺操作，结果机物料和原料消耗就趋于正常，实现了高产，还大大地降低了生产成本。
    在增加产品数量和降低生产成本发生矛盾的时候，必须根据具体情况来确定方针。对于某些对发展国民经济有重大意义的产品，我们应当首先尽全力解决有与无的问题，够用与不够用的问题；在这个基础上，再考虑如何降低生产成本。因为，任何事物的发展过程，都是从无到有，逐步提高的，产品的生产成本也是逐步降低的。试制新产品成本虽然高一些，但不应当因此放弃试制，否则我们将永远制不出新产品。社会主义制度的优越性，正表现在经济核算突破了个别企业的狭隘范围，而以是否对整个国民经济有利为前提。所以，成本高的企业不会被成本低的企业所排挤，还可以从“高级”赢利出发，对某些暂时亏损的产品进行补贴。但是，把“有比没有好”夸大到根本不计较生产成本的程度，也是不对的。新产品试制期间还是要进行技术改革、加强管理、尽量防止浪费。在试制成功，正式生产之后，更要逐步降低生产成本。假如炼一吨铁的生产成本超过了一吨钢的价格，便不能说“有比没有好”，很可能是生产的物资远抵不上消耗的物资。在这时候，生产成本便成了主要问题；必须解决这方面的问题，才能使生产前进。
    降低产品生产成本和提高产品质量，也是不可分割的。
  降低成本和提高质量的关系
    降低产品成本是省的要求，提高产品质量是好的要求，好和省是辩证地统一的。以同样多的生产成本，生产的产品质量好，比如，靴鞋一双可以顶两双穿，机床一台可以顶两台用，干电池放光时间延长一倍，这实际上等于生产成本降低了一半。如果生产的鞋子是“礼拜鞋”，袜子是“过街通”，干电池放光时间从五百分钟缩短到一百分钟，那末，尽管单位产品生产成本并未提高甚至有所降低，但是产品质量下降实际上等于产品数量的减少。五个质量差的干电池只顶上一个质量好的干电池的放光时间。除非是质量差的干电池的生产成本，相当于或者低于质量好的干电池的生产成本的五分之一，否则，要求干电池放光五百分钟所需要耗费的生产成本，实际上是提高而不是降低。所以，从一定的意义上讲，提高产品质量就是降低了生产成本。
    但是，好和省之间也有矛盾。前些时在有些产品的生产中，简化了工序，改变了工艺过程，节省了工时，降低了生产成本，成绩固然很大；但其中也有一些因为简化过多，影响了产品质量。有的是节省工时有限，影响质量不小，例如轴承不上油，既影响机器运转，又加速机器磨损。有的还因为原料、材料供应不富裕，在大力节省原料、材料消耗的过程中，在利用较次的原料或者采用代用品的过程中，也有某些产品质量降低。
    因为好和省之间还有矛盾，有些同志就感到“鱼与熊掌不可得兼”，要好就不能省，要省就不能好。这种看法是不正确的。事实上，只有在保证质量的前提下，压缩工时和节约原材料消耗才有意义，否则得不偿失。要使产品质量好，也并不是必须多耗工时，而只是不能把必要的工序任意简化，不能任意破坏生产的正常秩序。质量好的产品也不一定要比质量差的产品多耗用原料、材料，有时多用了原料、材料，产品质量反而下降。凸版印刷纸每一平方米重五十二克，质量是优等的，要是多用了纸浆，使重量达到六十克以上，纸张就会太厚，质量反而降低了。可见，要保证和提高产品质量，并不一定要增加成本。
    关心产品质量，在保证质量和提高质量的基础上降低生产成本，从我国目前来说更有重要的实际意义。降低废次损耗率，减少返工修理，正是我国目前许多工厂企业降低产品成本的主要途径之一。在建筑业中，有些建筑因为施工过程中降低了工程质量，不得不返工重修，造成很大浪费；有些机械工厂，铸件的废品率达到30％以上，制出来的成品精度差，效能低，不得不返工重修，甚至报废，这都会使生产成本提高。在轻工业中，残损率的大小，常常是很多企业生产成本提高或者降低的关键性问题。可见，促使广大职工群众关心产品质量，在生产过程中加强对半制品、在制品的检验，防止在完工后再来返修，并且加强技术管理制度和生产管理制度，反对那些足以降低产品质量的盲目压缩工时和节约原材料的措施，从而降低废次损耗率，是可以在保证和提高质量的基础上降低生产成本的，鱼与熊掌是可以兼得的。
    降低成本还要注意到长远和
          整体的经济利益
    全面地贯彻多快好省的建设方针，不仅要在大力降低生产成本的同时，严格注意增加产量和提高质量；而且要做到：既注意到今天的生产，又考虑到明天的生产；既注意到局部的经济效果，又从整体的经济利益出发；既关心生产，又关心群众生活。
    今天的生产和明天的生产息息相关。我们为了增加产量，降低成本，提高了固定资产的利用率，实现了增产节约的要求，当然是很好的事情。譬如，在纺织部门，把细纱机前罗拉速度从二百多转加快到三百以至四百转，车速加快；在公路运输部门实行双班运输，延长了检修时间；在电力部门实行了超铭牌运行，有的发电出力甚至超过设备铭牌的30％，等等。但是，提高了固定资产的利用率，设备磨损必然加速。这就必须注意设备的保护和维修，否则设备损坏会加速。从今天来看是增加了产量，降低了成本；但从长远来看，则可能提前报废，减少产量，提高成本。而且，不注意设备保护和维修，还容易发生事故。在电力部门今天多发了几度电，明天因为设备损坏而突然停电，高炉就要因无法继续供热而使铁水凝结，必须拆毁重建；印染厂就要因为染布后无法进行水洗、烘干而使布匹霉烂，在经济上造成极大损失。可见，在提高设备利用率的同时，应当加强对设备的保护和维修。
    在大力降低生产成本的同时，还必须既注意局部的经济利益，又服从整体的经济利益。整个国民经济的发展，国民收入的增加，要以各个企业增加生产、降低成本、增加利润为基础，整体的经济利益和局部的经济利益是一致的。但是，整体的经济利益和局部的经济利益有时也会发生矛盾。这就要求从整体经济利益出发，暂时放弃局部经济利益。比如机械的生产，如果成批大量生产，就可以增加产量，降低生产成本，但是只注意成批大量的生产，而延迟了交货时间，这就可能使机器设备的配套发生阻碍，从而影响建设进度和投入生产的时间，使钢铁工厂安装了转炉，却因缺少轧钢机而不能炼钢成材，使发电厂安装了锅炉、汽轮机、发电机，却因缺少变压器而不能供电。机械工厂为了按照计划及时交货，必须分批生产。这样虽然可能使生产成本降低的幅度小些，然而有利于整个国民经济的发展。所以成本核算的眼界，不能仅限于一个企业范围，还必须要有全局观点，服从整个国民经济的利益。
    在地区、企业之间调拨供应原材料，组织协作生产，完成产品计划等方面，也是这样。产棉地区愿意把好棉花留给当地企业来用，但是把好棉花调运到上海；可以纺成一百二十支乃至二百支的细纱，国家所得的经济利益更大；完成协作生产任务可能使本企业在组织生产上遭到一些麻烦，但对方却可蒙利；全面完成产品计划，可能不利于发挥本企业专长，还可能生产一些产值小、费工多、成本高、利润少的产品，但却保证了市场供应，满足了各方面的需要。在遇到这些情形的时候，就应当把本地区、本企业的增产节约的利益服从国家计划的要求。
    在大力降低生产成本的时候，必须既关心生产又关心人，关心群众生活。提高劳动生产率是降低生产成本的重要方面，但是我们也不应当靠过分提高劳动强度来提高劳动生产率，而是要从技术革新和技术革命方面多动脑筋。节约开支是降低生产成本的一个重要方面，但是我们决不能因为厉行节约而省掉了必要的劳动保护、安全设备、福利卫生的开支。这不仅是因为过分的提高劳动强度，节减了必要的劳动保护和福利卫生方面的开支，有可能引起企业职工出勤率降低，不利于劳动力调配和劳动组织工作，最终是不能提高劳动生产率。更重要的是社会主义制度下发展生产的目的，是为了更好地满足人们的需要。同时，也只有关心人，关心群众生活，关心安全生产，才能更好地发挥人的作用，使生产高速度发展。
    为了争取国民经济的继续大跃进，我们必须认真开展增产节约运动，大力降低产品生产成本。但是，降低产品生产成本只是组织企业生产的一个方面，即降低活劳动和物化劳动消耗的方面；而企业生产的各个方面，都是互相关联、互相依存的统一体。而且随着条件的不断发展变化，各方面的关系也在发展变化，这就要求我们防止工作中的片面性，防止“单打一”的倾向。只顾一面、不问其余，会使正确的事情转化为错误的事情。因此，组织企业生产必须从全面出发，不能孤立地只从产品数量或成本、质量等一面来考虑。只有全面地贯彻多快好省的建设方针，才能更好地组织生产的继续跃进。
