Editor's Note:

    "Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the water to eat the water." This saying has been circulating among the masses of farmers for a long time, but it is still a "living language." It can guide the adaptation of rural production to local conditions and the development of diversified economy.
    Recently, all localities have paid attention to the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In agriculture, they are advancing on the basis of the summer harvest to strive for a bumper autumn harvest. At the same time, vigorously develop livestock and poultry, and develop the aquatic products industry. The National Forestry Bureau Directors Conference required the implementation of the policy of combining mass afforestation with state-owned afforestation; and required the construction of timber forests, protective forests, economic forests, fuel forests, etc., according to local conditions.
    The July 15th editorial of this newspaper pointed out that "running forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries is also for the better development of agriculture." Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are mutually beneficial and mutually promoting. The production practice of various people's communes in Balin Right Banner, Inner Mongolia, proves that "the development of agriculture has promoted the development of animal husbandry, the development of animal husbandry has further promoted agriculture, and agriculture and animal husbandry have vigorously promoted forestry and sideline production." This is conducive to making the best use of the land, making the best use of talents, obtaining goods from their sources, and prospering the economy.
    The third quarter is a favorable season for planting trees and afforestation, raising and catching aquatic products, grazing cattle and sheep, and raising poultry. It is hoped that all localities will seize the seasonal characteristics of diversified economy and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

    多种经营好
    农民群众中流行一句话：“靠山吃山，靠水吃水。”这句话已经流传很久，但它至今还是“活的语言”。它可以指导农村生产的因地制宜，开展多种经营。
    近来，各地已经注意到农林牧副渔五业的全面发展。在农业方面，正在夏季丰收的基础上乘胜前进，争取秋季大丰收。同时，大力发展家畜家禽，发展水产事业。全国林业厅局长会议要求贯彻群众造林与国营造林并举的方针；并要求因地制宜营造用材林、防护林、经济林、薪炭林等等。
    本报七月十五日社论中指明，“办林业、牧业、副业和渔业，也是为了更好地发展农业”，农林牧副渔五业是相互为用、相互促进的。内蒙古巴林右旗各人民公社的生产实践证明：“农业的发展推动了牧业生产，牧业生产的发展，又进一步推动了农业，而农牧业又有力地推动了林业和副业生产。”这就有利于地尽其利，人尽其才，货得其源，繁荣经济。
    第三季度正是植树造林、养捕水产、放牧牛羊、喂养家禽等的有利季节，希望各地抓紧多种经营季节性的特点，争取农林牧副渔齐丰收。
