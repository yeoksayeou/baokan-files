Salesman Welcomed by Factories
By our reporter Cao Baoming

At the beginning of the year, the Wuhan Sports and Entertainment Instrument Wholesale Store put forward the slogan "Be a Pioneer for Industrial Production" and sent people to factories as resident staff to promote cooperation between factories and stores. Xie Yunqin, who was stationed at the Wuhan Cultural and Sports Factory, also supported this measure, but he was a little worried about whether he could do this job well.

The first time Xie Yunqin and the branch secretary Wang Bingyan visited the leaders of the Wuhan Cultural and Sports Factory, they were told, "We are in a meeting, please wait a moment." They were made to wait from nine in the morning until twelve noon without even a greeting. When they finally met, they only said coldly: "We still have what you want now. It was left over from the year before last. Please help us purchase it." With that, they went to eat, without even a word of courtesy. Xie Yunqin thought, "What should I do?"

It was truly "when it rains, it pours." An accident occurred in the factory's hardware workshop, burning out several motors. Seeing that the machine tools could not be turned on, the hardware components for all kinds of products in the factory could not be assembled. How could they cooperate? He hurriedly rode his bicycle back to the store to report the situation. Wang Bingyan was also anxious at the time and immediately rushed to the factory to express his condolences. In the evening, he held an emergency meeting, mobilizing all the store's employees: "We must treat the factory's difficulties as our own! Everyone must try every possible means to solve the motor problem and help the cultural and sports factory resume production within a week." Seeing that the leadership was so serious, Xie Yunqin listened and thought: "Where can I get motors? The hardware and electrical company must have them, but this factory is not a priority, so they won't give them any." But he thought that his former colleague, Wang Jiamao, worked in the Steel Command of the Jianghan District Commercial Bureau. Steel production was turning from small native furnaces to small modern furnaces, so there might be some extra small motors. After the meeting at nine o'clock, he went to find Wang Jiamao that night. As a result, Wang Jiamao agreed to lend him two five-horsepower motors.

Much to his surprise, when the wholesale store's branch secretary and store director led more than a dozen people, carrying the two motors he had borrowed, along with a motor and some iron bars (materials) obtained from elsewhere, and sent them to the cultural and sports factory with gongs and drums, the cultural and sports factory immediately held a staff meeting to welcome them. Xiao Guohua, the factory's branch secretary, also spoke at the meeting, saying: "The comrades of the wholesale store treat the factory's difficulties as their own, sending motors and materials to support us. We must work hard to improve production, ensure market supply, and strengthen industrial and commercial cooperation."

From then on, Xie Yunqin summed up a piece of experience: we must treat the other party's difficulties as our own to cooperate well. The store and the factory jointly put forward the slogan "Industry's difficulties, commerce shares; market supply, industry also manages," and further organized industrial and commercial cooperation competitions. At this time, he followed the instructions of the branch and went to the workshop to work with the workers. During the labor, he learned that the factory was short of manpower. More than 1,500 solid balls for patients' exercise had the shells made, but not filled with sand. Thirty pairs of ping-pong tables, forty-five vaulting boxes, and fifty pairs of parallel bars were assembled, but not painted, so they could not leave the factory. He immediately reported to the store, and the store leaders organized more than forty employees (including painters) to work voluntarily at the factory, so that these semi-finished products immediately became finished products and left the factory. He also learned that the factory had a batch of products accumulated in the past that had not been processed, and asked the store leaders to send people to help clean up the warehouse, cleaning up a total of seventy-seven kinds of products, worth more than 10,000 yuan. This not only supplied the market in a timely manner, but also helped the factory solve the problem of working capital. Once, the factory's netting workshop stopped work for half a day due to a shortage of cotton yarn, with more than thirty people idle. As soon as he saw this situation, he called the store leaders, and after contacting various parties, he allocated three pieces of cotton yarn to the factory that afternoon.

Xie Yunqin actively helped the factory overcome difficulties, and the factory also took the initiative to adjust its production to meet market needs. Originally, badminton rackets had a small output value and took a lot of work. A worker could generally make 30 to 50 yuan a day, and the output value of each badminton racket could only reach five yuan. The factory had stopped production long ago because the output value was too small. But when the factory's branch secretary and director heard Xie Yunqin report that the market urgently needed badminton rackets, they immediately drew four workers to specialize in the production of this product. The workers also wrote a jingle: "In the past, we desperately made products with large output value, and left those with small output value aside. Now that industry and commerce are one family, large and small commodities are produced together, with meeting the market as the fundamental goal." He and the comrades from the store brought many commodities to the factory for exhibition. After the workers visited, they took the initiative to use the scrap leather left over from making balls to make wristbands, knee pads, and other products, which not only made full use of the scrap material, but also supplied the market. The factory's Communist Youth League also organized a shock team to clean up the warehouse, finding raw materials such as copper sheets with an output value of more than 10,000 yuan, solving part of the material problem.

Xie Yunqin was more familiar with the production of the cultural and sports factory. He considered that the base of the parallel bars originally made by this factory was two large pieces of wood, each fifteen centimeters wide and high, and two meters and four centimeters long, which was too material-consuming and too bulky. He discussed with a Wu master craftsman in the woodworking workshop to change the base into six detachable sections, fixed with screws. In this way, less large material can be used when wood is relatively scarce, and the number of parallel bars loaded on a flatbed truck is increased from one to three, improving the utilization rate of transportation tools; while the quality of the parallel bars is still very strong and solid. The factory's employees also actively strived to improve technology, increase production efficiency, and improve product quality. They originally painted abacuses manually, and one person could only paint 78 abacuses a day, which could not keep up with other processes. The workers devised a way to first let the abacuses "take a bath" and then wipe them manually, and they immediately achieved a rate of 780 abacuses painted per person per day, increasing efficiency by nine times.

The reporter recently interviewed Xie Yunqin. He said: Linking the store's purchase plan with the factory's production plan, and planning production according to market needs, is an important step in doing a good job in both production and supply. After participating in the cooperation competition, the Wuhan Cultural and Sports Factory has expanded the variety of products by 23 types, and is still trial-producing 24 types, and completes the production plan every month. The products purchased by our store from this factory have also gradually increased from less than 10,000 yuan in January to 80,000 yuan a month.

    受到工厂欢迎的营业员
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    年初，武汉市体育文娱仪器批发商店提出“为工业生产当好尖兵”的口号，派人去工厂作驻厂员，搞工厂与商店的协作。派驻武汉文娱体育厂的谢运钦，虽然也挺拥护这项措施，但是，他对能不能搞好这个工作，却有些耽心。
    谢运钦第一次跟支部书记王炳炎去拜访武汉文体厂的领导同志，人家说：“我们正在开会，请等一下。”就让他俩从上午九点钟等起，一直等到中午十二点钟，也不打个照面。临见了面，也只冷冷地说了句：你们现在要的东西，我们还有，是前年留下来的，请帮忙收购一下。”说着，就各自吃饭去了，连句客气话也不说。谢运钦想：“这怎么办？”
    真是“屋漏偏遇连夜雨”。这个厂的五金车间出了个事故，把几个马达烧了，眼看着机床不能转动，全厂各种产品的五金构件都配不起来，还怎么搞协作？他慌忙骑着车子回店汇报情况。王炳炎当时也着了急，立即赶到厂里去慰问，晚上又召开紧急大会，动员全店职工：“要把工厂的困难当做自己的困难！我们每个人都要想尽各种办法来解决马达问题，帮助文娱体育厂在一星期内恢复生产。”谢运钦见领导上这样认真，便边听边想：“哪去搞马达呢？五金交电公司一定有，但这个厂不是重点，它根本不会给的。”但他想到从前的同事王家茂在江汉区商业局的钢铁指挥部工作，钢铁生产正由小土炉转向小洋炉，可能多出一些小马达来。九点多钟开完会，他便连夜去找王家茂。结果，王家茂答应借给两部五马力的马达。
    简直出他意料之外，当批发店的支部书记、店主任率领着十几个人，将他借到的两部马达，连同从别处搞的一部马达和一些铁条（材料），敲锣打鼓送往文体厂时，文体厂马上开了个职工大会来欢迎他们。工厂支部书记萧国华还在会上讲话，说：“批发商店的同志们把工厂的困难当做自己商业部门的困难，送来马达、材料，支援我们。我们一定要努力搞好生产，保证市场供应，加强工商协作。”
    从此，谢运钦总结了一条经验：必须把对方的困难当做自己的困难，才能搞好协作。商店和工厂共同提出了“工业困难，商业分担；市场供应，工业也管”的口号，进一步组织工商协作竞赛。这时候，他就按照支部的指示，到车间同工人一起劳动。在劳动中，他了解到工厂人手少，有一千五百多个病人运动用的实心球做好了球壳，没有填沙，有三十副乒乓球台、四十五个跳箱和五十副双杠装配好了，没有油漆，都出不了厂。他马上向商店汇报，商店领导上就组织了四十多名职工（包括会油漆的工人）去工厂义务劳动，使这些半成品立时成为成品出厂。他还了解到厂里有一批过去积存的产品没处理，又请示商店领导上派人去帮助清理仓库，共清理出七十七种，一万多元的产品。这样，既及时供应了市场，又帮助工厂解决了流动资金问题。有一次，工厂的制网车间因为缺棉纱，三十多人停了半天工。他一见这种情况，就打电话给商店领导同志，经过多方面联系，当天下午就拨了三件棉纱运到工厂。
    谢运钦积极帮助工厂克服困难，工厂也主动为满足市场需要调整了自己的生产。本来，羽毛球拍产值小、费工夫，一个工人一天一般能做三十至五十元，每只羽毛球拍的产值只能达到五元，厂里因为产值太小，早就停止了生产。但工厂里的支部书记和厂长听到谢运钦汇报市场急需羽毛球拍，马上就抽了四个工人专门生产这种产品。工人们还写了个顺口溜：“过去是产值大的拼命做，产值小的丢一旁。如今工商成一家，大小商品齐并举，满足市场为根本。”他和商店的同志带着许多商品到工厂展览，工人们参观过后，就主动用制球剩下的碎皮做成护腕、护膝等产品，既充分利用了碎料，又供应了市场。工厂的共青团还组织突击队清理仓库，找出了产值一万多元的铜片等原材料，解决了一部分用料问题。
    谢运钦对文娱体育厂的生产比较熟悉了，他考虑这个工厂原来制作双杠的底盘，宽高各十五公分、长两公尺四的大木料两根，太耗料，也太笨重。他就同木工车间一个姓吴的老师傅商量，将底盘改为能拆卸的六段，用螺丝固定。这样便能在木料比较缺乏的情况下，少用大料，同时由过去一部板车装一副双杠增加为三副，提高了运输工具的利用率；而双杠的质量依然很牢固，很坚实。工厂的职工也积极努力改进技术，提高生产效率，提高产品质量。他们原来油漆算盘是用人工抹，一人一天只能漆七十八把，赶不上其他工序。工人们设法改为先让算盘“洗澡”，再用人抹，一下子就做到一人一天漆七百八十把，提高工效九倍。
    记者最近访问了谢运钦。他说：把商店的购进计划和工厂的生产计划衔接起来，按市场需要，计划生产，这是搞好生产又搞好供应的重要一着。武汉文娱体育厂在参加协作竞赛后，已经扩大生产品种二十三种，还正在试制二十四种，并且月月完成生产计划。我们商店从这个厂购进的产品，也由一月份一万元不到，逐渐上升到一个月八万元。
