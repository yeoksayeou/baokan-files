Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 26th: The vigilant Cuban armed forces captured Rafael del Pino, one of the ringleaders of the counter-revolutionary organization "White Rose" on the 24th. This American counter-revolutionary infiltrated Cuba from Miami, USA, plotting to organize a plan to sabotage the mass rally to be held in Havana on July 26th. When this counter-revolutionary ringleader attempted to escape in his American small plane, he was captured after the plane was destroyed.

Havana revolutionary police cracked down on a rebellion plot in the Principe Prison today and seized weapons. Thanks to the support and vigilance of the people, seventy-two counter-revolutionaries from the "White Rose" organization, led by war criminals from Miami, have also been recently discovered and arrested in Las Villas Province. The enemy's military adventures and counter-revolutionary sabotage plans have been crushed by the iron fists of the army and the people due to the arrest of a large number of counter-revolutionary elements.

    美籍反革命头目潜入古巴破坏落网
    新华社哈瓦那26日电　警惕着的古巴武装部队24日捕获了反革命组织“白玫瑰”的头目之一拉斐尔·德尔皮诺。这个美国籍的反革命分子自美国迈阿密潜入古巴，阴谋组织一个破坏7月26日在哈瓦那举行的群众大会的计划。当这个反革命头目企图乘他的美国小飞机逃跑时，由于飞机被击毁而被俘获。
    哈瓦那革命警察今天在普林西佩监狱破获了叛乱阴谋，缴获了武器。由于人民的支持和警惕，拉斯维利亚斯省最近还发现和逮捕了战争罪犯从迈阿密领导的“白玫瑰”组织的七十二名反革命分子。敌人的军事冒险和反革命破坏计划由于大批反革命分子的落网而被军队和人民的铁拳粉碎了。
