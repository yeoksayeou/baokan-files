    Everything Through Experimentation
    —Wheat Production Increase Experience in Jishan County, Shanxi
    This Reporter
    Jishan County, Shanxi Province, has achieved an unprecedented bumper wheat harvest. This year's total wheat output increased by 64.6% compared to last year, and the per-mu yield increased by 92.9% compared to last year. The county has overfulfilled the task of selling surplus grain, and the food ration for commune members has increased by 85.7% compared to previous years. The whole county is filled with joy.
    A county increasing its total wheat production by 64.6% in one year is an astonishing rate of growth. Did they have uniquely advantageous conditions for increased production? The situation is not so. Jishan's natural conditions are not considered good; in the Jinan area, it belongs to the third or fourth category. Of the county's 760,500 mu of wheat fields, over 90% are dry land and slopes; along the Fen River, there are also many alkaline lands; near the Yellow River, most of the land is sandy, making it difficult for seedlings to grow. Under these conditions, how did Jishan County achieve such a great wheat harvest?
  Sowing Plants the Roots of a Bumper Harvest
    The masses in Jishan County have discovered a law of increasing production from generations of wheat farming experience. In their words, "Wheat depends on sowing, autumn depends on weeding." Last year, Jishan wheat was completely sown from the Autumn Equinox to the Cold Dew (i.e., September 23 to October 9 in the Gregorian calendar last year). According to investigations, whether the sowing period is timely or not is an important factor in increasing production under the same natural and farming conditions. The investigation results are as follows:
    Wheat sown on October 1st yielded 590 jin per mu;
    Wheat sown on October 5th yielded 640 jin per mu;
    Wheat sown on October 10th yielded 605 jin per mu;
    Wheat sown on October 15th yielded 530 jin per mu;
    Wheat sown on October 20th yielded 455 jin per mu;
    Wheat sown on October 25th yielded 370 jin per mu; sowing from October 1st to 10th is the best.
    In order to sow wheat well, the county party committee secretary in charge of agriculture, the deputy county head in charge of agriculture, the county party committee's rural work minister, the office director, the director of the agriculture and forestry bureau, and others formed a leading force for wheat sowing. The method of "county contracting to commune, commune contracting to management area, area contracting to team" was adopted to ensure good quality at each level in three aspects: good sowing quality, no reduction in area, and timely sowing. The county also extracted 140,000 laborers to form specialized wheat teams for timely sowing. At the same time, the county party committee used great efforts to organize the modification of old drills, promote the "four-four drill" (i.e., row spacing of four inches wide, sowing width of four inches wide), universally train technicians, and make a series of preparations, thereby ensuring the quality of wheat sowing.
    Implementing the "Eight-Character Charter"
    According to Local Conditions
    The "Eight-Character Charter" is a comprehensive measure for increasing agricultural production; emphasizing any single character in isolation is not enough. This year, Jishan's wheat production implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" relatively comprehensively. The county's wheat fields were deep-plowed to about eight inches; the phenomenon of sowing on bare ground was eliminated, and the average fertilizer application per mu reached about 8,000 jin, more than double that of previous years; basically, reasonable close planting was achieved, with an average sowing rate of 24.4 jin per mu in the county. Irrigated land averaged about 30 jin of seeds per mu, and dry land averaged about 20 jin of seeds per mu. The experimental results of many management areas show that this sowing rate is appropriate. For example, in the Xin Feng management area of the Hejin commune, under the same conditions, the mu yield with a sowing rate of 24 jin was 475.2 jin; the mu yield with a sowing rate of 32 jin was 474.5 jin; and the mu yield with a sowing rate of 40 jin was 489.6 jin.
    Each people's commune selected superior varieties suitable for local growth based on years of local planting experience and treated the seeds with pesticides. In addition, insect pests were generally controlled at the time of sowing, so this year's wheat generally achieved full and strong seedlings. In terms of wheat management, the county party committee adopted the policy of "recognizing differences, eliminating differences," and continuously classified and ranked the wheat fields throughout the year to strengthen management. At the time of wheat greening, 26% of the county's wheat fields were in the third category, but after processing and management, the proportion decreased to 8.6%. Continuously eliminating imbalances and continuously advancing, the wheat management became more and more detailed and better and better.
    Of course, the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" was accompanied by a struggle. The most prominent aspects were deep plowing and close planting. Initially, some cadres and young people advocated that the land should be plowed three feet deep, and that 40, 50, or 60 jin of seeds should be sown. Some old farmers held the opposite view, advocating shallow cultivation and sparse planting. Thus, the issue of deep versus shallow, dense versus sparse, sparked debates throughout the county. The more the truth is debated, the clearer it becomes. The vast majority of people believed that close planting can indeed increase production, but it should not be too dense, nor should it be the same everywhere. Some places proposed a "five-look" close planting plan: look at the thickness of the soil, look at the amount of manure, look at the size of the seeds, look at the width of the sowing, and look at the earliness or lateness of the sowing period. In a word, plant crops flexibly. Planting crops flexibly, this is vivid dialectics. The county party committee was greatly inspired, changed its original rigid regulations, put forward a general range, and allowed localities to adapt to local conditions in the implementation. The county party committee's correct policy encouraged people to actively explore the laws of nature and flexibly apply the "Eight-Character Charter."
  Small Field Experiments, Large Field Promotion
    Practice is the standard for testing truth. Many of the technical measures adopted by Jishan County this year have been tested in the "small farms." After small field experiments, they are then promoted in large fields.
    Before the wheat sowing last year, in order to obtain a complete set of experiences for implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" in different areas of the county, Jishan established eleven wheat "small farms." These "small farms" had plains, slopes, irrigated land, and dry land, everything that was needed. The heads of the "small farms" were mostly commune party committee secretaries. Each "small farm" universally conducted comparative experiments on deep plowing, fertilization, close planting, varieties, and sowing periods. Therefore, it provided a great deal of valuable information for large-area high-yield fields. The wheat sowing period comparison on the Hejin commune's "small farm" showed that wheat sown too early or too late grew very poorly, only the wheat sown at the right time grew strong and healthy. This fact was very obvious and was very educational for cadres and the masses. Huang Shunyuan, director of the Zhai Dian management area of the Zhai Dian commune, said: "With the experimental data from the 'small farm,' we can speak with confidence." This year, Jishan held on-site meetings and organized visits to the "small farms" twenty-one times. Commune leaders regarded it as a classroom for promoting new technologies. Because the "small farms" truly played a role in promoting large-area high yields, the masses called the "small farms" "leading fields" or "scientific fields."
    Jointly Plan for Increased Production
    All the production increase measures taken by Jishan County are the result of consultation with the masses. Before wheat sowing last year, the county party committee held three symposiums. At the symposium, someone suggested reducing the wheat sowing area. But the old farmers disagreed. They said that Jishan's natural conditions were not good, and reducing wheat planting would definitely lead to losses. During the sowing period, someone suggested late sowing in order to delay wheat seedling emergence in the following year, so as not to be harmed by late frost. When this matter was discussed with the masses, they also disagreed. They emphasized sowing without violating the agricultural season. The county party committee initially considered specifying a sowing rate of 40 jin per mu for irrigated land and 30 jin per mu for dry land this year, but the masses advocated adapting to local conditions and reasonable close planting. In short, before deciding on each major measure, the county party committee consulted with the masses and listened to their opinions.
    One person's wisdom is limited, but the power of the masses is infinite. The Jishan County Party Committee used a variety of methods, such as symposiums, on-site visits, and inviting "advisers," to gather the wisdom of the broad masses and allow them to participate in leadership, participate in management, and jointly discuss wheat production increase plans. This vivid mass line method is the most fundamental experience among this year's unprecedented bumper wheat harvest experience.

    一切通过试验
    ——山西稷山县小麦增产经验
    本报记者
    山西省稷山县的小麦，获得了空前大丰收。今年小麦总产量比去年提高了64.6％，亩产比去年提高92.9％。全县超额完成了出售余粮的任务，社员的口粮比往年提高了85.7％。全县到处呈现欢乐的景象。
    一个县在一年之内，把小麦的总产提高了64.6％，这是一个惊人的增长速度。是不是他们有着得天独厚的增产条件呢？情况并非如此。稷山的自然条件并不算好，在晋南地区来说，它属于三类或者四类地区。全县七十六万零五百多亩小麦田，90％以上都是旱地和坡地；汾河沿岸还有许多碱地；靠近黄河的地方，多为沙滩地，很难长苗。在这样的条件下，稷山县是怎样赢得了小麦大丰收呢？
  播种扎下丰收根
    稷山县的群众，从几辈子种小麦的经验中摸到了一条增产规律。用他们的话来说，就是“麦在种，秋在锄”。去年稷山小麦从秋分开始到寒露（即去年阳历9月23日至10月9日）即全部下种完毕。根据调查，在同等自然条件和耕作条件下，播种期是否适时，是增产的一个重要因素。调查情况如下：
    10月1日播种，小麦亩产五百九十斤；
    10月5日播种，亩产六百四十斤；
    10月10日播种，亩产六百零五斤；
    10月15日播种，亩产五百三十斤；
    10月20日播种，亩产四百五十五斤。
    10月25日播种，亩产三百七十斤；以10月1日至10日播种为最好。
    为了把小麦种好，由县委管农业的书记、管农业的副县长、县委农村工作部长、办公室主任、农林局长等，组成一支小麦播种的领导力量。采取县包社、社包管理区、区包队的办法，层层把好三关，即：播种质量好，面积不得少，下种要适时。全县还抽出十四万个劳力，组成小麦专业队，及时抢种。与此同时，县委用很大的力量，组织改造了旧耧，推广了“四四耧”（即行距四寸宽，播幅四寸宽），普遍训练技术员，作了一系列的准备工作，从而保证了小麦播种质量。
    因地制宜贯彻
    “八字宪法”
    “八字宪法”，是一项综合性的农业增产措施，孤立地强调那一个字都不行。今年稷山小麦生产贯彻“八字宪法”比较全面。全县麦田深翻了八寸左右；消灭了白茬下种的现象，每亩平均施肥量达到八千斤左右，超过往年一倍多；基本上做到了合理密植，全县平均下籽量为二十四斤四两，水地平均每亩下种子三十斤左右，旱地每亩平均下种子二十斤左右。许多管理区试验结果表明，以上这个播种量是适当的。例如河津公社辛封管理区在同等条件下，水地播种量二十四斤的，亩产四百七十五斤二两；播种量三十二斤的，亩产四百七十四斤半；播种量四十斤的，亩产四百八十九斤六两。
    各人民公社都根据当地多年种植的经验，选择了适合当地生长的优良品种，并且用药剂拌了种。加上下种时普遍治了一次虫害，因此今年的小麦普遍达到了苗全、苗壮。在小麦的管理上，县委采取了“承认差别，消灭差别”的方针，一年来不断分类排队，加强管理。在小麦返青时，全县有26％的三类小麦，经过加工管理，下降为8.6％。不断消除不平衡，不断前进，使小麦管理越来越细，越做越好。
    当然，贯彻“八字宪法”，是经过了一番斗争的。表现最突出的是深翻和密植。最初一部分干部和青年人主张土地要翻它三尺深，种子要下个四、五十斤，五、六十斤。一些老农则持相反的看法，主张浅耕稀植。于是深与浅，密与稀的问题，全县到处展开了争辩。真理越辩越明，绝大多数人认为，密植的确能增产，可不能太密，也不能各地一模一样。有的地方提出“五看”密植方案：一看土壤厚薄，二看粪土多少，三看籽粒大小，四看播幅宽窄，五看播期迟早。一句话，要活种庄稼。活种庄稼，这就是生动的辩证法。县委大受启发，改变了原来的死硬规定，提出了一个一般的幅度，而且允许各地在执行中因地制宜。县委这条正确的方针，鼓励了人们去积极探索自然规律，灵活地运用“八字宪法”。
  小田试验大田推广
    实践是检验真理的标准。稷山县今年采取的许多技术措施，都通过了试验的场所——“小农场”。经过小田试验再大田推广。
    在去年小麦播种之前，为了获得在全县不同地区贯彻“八字宪法”的一套完整的经验，稷山建立了十一个小麦“小农场”。这些“小农场”里有平地、有坡地、有水地、有旱地，应有尽有。“小农场”的场长多半是公社党委书记。每个“小农场”普遍进行深翻、施肥、密殖、品种、播期等对比试验，因此，它为大面积丰产田提供了许多宝贵资料。河津公社“小农场”的小麦播种期对比，下种过早或过晚的小麦生长很坏，唯有适时播种的小麦生长肥壮，事实非常明显，对干部群众教育很大。翟店公社翟店管理区主任黄顺元说：“有了‘小农场’的试验资料，说话就大胆了。”今年稷山各地共在“小农场”召开现场会、组织参观达二十一次，公社领导把它当作推广新技术的课堂。因为“小农场”对大面积丰产真正起了推动作用，所以群众都把“小农场”叫做“带头田”或“科学田”。
    共谋增产大计
    稷山县所采取的一切增产措施，都是和群众商量的结果。去年小麦播种以前，县委曾召开过三次座谈会。在座谈会上，有人曾建议缩小小麦播种面积。但老农不同意，他们说，稷山自然条件不好，少种小麦一定要吃亏。在下种期间，有人提出晚种，为的是使次年小麦发苗迟，不致受晚霜侵害。把这件事和群众商量，他们也不同意，他们强调不违农时下种。县委最初考虑把今年下种量规定为水地每亩四十斤，旱地每亩三十斤，群众却主张因地制宜，合理密植。总之，县委在决定每一项重大措施以前，都和群众商量，听取他们的意见。
    一个人智慧有限，群众的力量无穷。稷山县委运用座谈会、现场参观、请“参谋”等多种多样办法，集中广大群众的智慧，让他们参加领导，参加管理，共商小麦增产大计。这种生动的群众路线的方法，是今年小麦获得空前大丰收经验当中的最根本的一条经验。
