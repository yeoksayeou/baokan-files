Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The Central Conservatory of Music is striving to strengthen students' technical skills and enhance their artistic expression capabilities with a spirit of "meticulous cultivation" in its teaching.

This semester, teachers have conscientiously developed lesson plans. In the past, the lesson plans developed by teachers in the orchestral department mainly considered technical issues and rarely related to the students' specific situations. This time, when developing plans, they emphasized both strengthening basic technical training and improving students' ability to express works based on their specific situations, and also paid attention to soliciting students' opinions. Teachers in this department have also changed their past practice of "lone wolfing" in teaching, and often research and discuss with each other. Teachers in the violin teaching and research section collectively studied Ma Sicong's "Saibei Dance." After discussion, they reached a consensus on some basic aspects such as the thought, form analysis, content, and emotions of the dance, which played a positive role in improving the quality of teaching.

Many teachers take care of both technique and ideology in their teaching. They carefully understand the reasons why students encounter difficulties in learning, and patiently help students improve. For example, when a student in the piano department was practicing the piece "Flower Drum," he could never play the first sentence well. When the teacher analyzed that the main reason why the student couldn't play well was that he was not familiar with the characteristics of the "drum," a national musical instrument, he explained in detail the unique drumbeats and timbres of our country, and helped the student master the characteristics and performance methods of this piece.

Under the strict requirements of the teachers, many students study diligently and meticulously. Jin Aiping, a second-year student in the piano department, felt that the piece "Temple Fair" was very simple and there was nothing to practice when she played it a year ago. This semester, she studied the piece section by section and found that she was not playing well in the section depicting the graceful Yao ethnic dance - the "Sheng Dance." So she asked a classmate who had worked in the Yao area for advice, and finally further improved her performance ability.

The college is also very strict with the training of the orchestra. The orchestral band once gave a well-received performance of the symphonic poem "Gada Meilin." Recently, when they were making records, they still practiced meticulously as if they were undertaking a new job. In order to better understand this piece, they also studied relevant materials. Sometimes they also recorded sections where there were shortcomings in the performance, so as to carefully study the causes and methods of correction. Because of this serious and conscientious attitude, the quality of this recording has improved compared to past performances. (Attached picture)

### 精雕细刻培养学生  中央音乐学院提高学生艺术表现能力

    精雕细刻培养学生
    中央音乐学院提高学生艺术表现能力
    新华社23日讯　中央音乐学院在教学中以“精雕细刻”的精神，努力加强学生的技术锻炼，提高学生的艺术表现能力。
    这个学期以来，教师认真地制定了授课计划。管弦乐系的教师过去订的授课计划多是单纯考虑技术方面问题，很少联系学生的具体情况，这次制定计划时，强调了既要加强基本技术训练又要根据学生的具体情况，提高他们对作品的表现能力，并且注意征求学生们的意见。这个系的教师们在授课时，也改变了过去“孤军作战”的作法，经常互相研究、讨论。小提琴教研室教师们集体研究了马思聪的“塞外舞曲”，经过讨论对舞曲的思想、曲体分析、内容和情绪等一些基本方面的理解达到了一致，对提高教学质量发生了积极作用。
    许多教师在教学中既管技术，又管思想。他们细致地了解学生在学习中产生困难的原因，耐心地帮助学生们提高。如钢琴系有个学生在练习“花鼓”这支乐曲时，第一句总是弹不好。当教师分析了学生弹不好的主要原因是对“鼓”这个民族乐器的特色不熟悉时，就给他详细地解释了我国特有的鼓点和音色，帮助学生掌握了这支乐曲的特点和表现方法。
    在教师严格地要求下，许多学生都刻苦细致地学习。钢琴系二年级学生金爱平，一年前弹“庙会”乐曲时，感到这支曲子很简单，没有什么可练的。这一学期她一段一段地研究了这支曲子，发现曲子中描写优美的瑶族舞蹈——“笙舞”的一段，自己还弹奏得不好，就找一个曾经在瑶族地区工作过的同学请教，终于进一步提高了自己的表现能力。
    这个学院对乐队的训练也很严格。管弦乐的乐队过去曾公演“戛达梅林”交响诗，获得了好评；最近他们灌制唱片时，仍然像从事一件新工作似的，一丝不苟地练习着，为了更好地理解这部乐曲，他们还研究了有关资料。有时还把演奏上有缺点段节录了音，以便仔细地研究发生的原因和改正方法，由于采取了这样严肃认真的态度，这次灌制的唱片，比过去演出的水平又有了提高。（附图片）
