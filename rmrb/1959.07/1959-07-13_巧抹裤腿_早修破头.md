Skillfully Apply Mud to Cotton Stalks, Repair Broken Heads Early
Huo Xiqing, Director of the Cultivation Department of the Shaanxi Cotton Research Institute

Do you know how to "apply mud to cotton stalks"? Some may say, what's so difficult about that, it's just removing the buds and leaves below the first fruiting branch. Actually, that's not right. Think about it, the fresh green leaves use photosynthesis to create organic nutrients to supply the cotton's growth, what good does it do to remove them all at once? You should only remove the buds and leave all the leaves. If you find that the buds have grown to four or five inches and developed into "youtiao" (twisted dough sticks), and flower eyes (flower buds) have also grown on them, then you shouldn't remove them either. Just leave two or three flower eyes on the "youtiao" and break off the tip of the "youtiao". In the future, the flower eyes on this "youtiao" will bloom and form bolls at the same time as the flower eyes on the fifth and sixth fruiting branches of the main stalk, which can increase cotton production.

Have you ever heard of repairing broken heads of cotton seedlings? The tips of cotton seedlings are often bitten off by blind bugs and cutworms. At this time, several branches will grow from the side, and these branches are called broken heads. If you encounter such cotton seedlings and do not repair them early, and let them grow, it will be difficult to flower and form bolls. The method of repairing is: in places where there is no lack of seedlings, only select and keep one large branch, and in places where the seedlings are sparse, you can also select and keep two, and remove the rest. These remaining branches, after growth and development, can flower and form bolls just like the normal main stalk.

    巧抹裤腿　早修破头
    陕西棉花研究所栽培系主任　霍席卿
    你会不会给棉花抹裤腿？有人也许说，这有啥难的，就是把第一个担子以下的芽子和叶片搬掉就是了。其实这样作是不对的。你想想，绿格生生的叶片，经过光合作用，才能够制造有机养料，供给棉花生长，你一下子搬下有啥好处。应该是只搬芽子，留下所有叶片。如果发现芽子已经长到四五寸，发展成了油条，上面还长出了花眼子（就是花蕾），这时也不应该搬掉，只是在油条上留两三个花眼子，把油条顶尖打掉就对了。将来这油条上的花眼子，要和主秆第五、六个担子上的花眼子同时开花结铃，能增加棉花产量。
    整修棉苗破头，你听说过没有？棉花幼苗的顶尖，往往容易被盲椿象和地老虎咬掉，这时要从旁边长出几个分枝，这些分枝就叫破头。遇到这样的棉苗，如果不及早整修，叫它生长下去，很难开花结铃。整修的办法是：在不缺苗的地方，只选留一个大的分枝，在苗稀的地方，还可以选留两个，把其余的都搬掉。这些留下的分枝，生长发育后，和正常的主秆一样，可以开花结铃。
