Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 24th: TASS reports from Geneva on the 23rd: At the Foreign Ministers' Conference's plenary session on the 23rd, the representatives of the three Western countries – Lloyd, Herter, and Couve de Murville – spoke in succession.

There was nothing new in their speeches, simply a repetition of their objections to the Soviet Union's proposal to establish an All-German Committee. The Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic had already pointed out in previous meetings that these objections were baseless. At the same time, they vehemently attacked the German Democratic Republic. Lloyd insisted that the policies of the German Democratic Republic were decided by "Moscow."

In response to these speeches by the representatives of the three Western countries, Gromyko pointed out that the Western representatives had repeatedly raised arguments against the Soviet Union's proposal to establish an All-German Committee or other feasible ways for negotiations between the two Germanys. Repeatedly using these arguments does not make them more convincing; they remain as untenable as before. Many of these arguments prove that the representatives of the Western countries are overly emotional in their attitude towards the German Democratic Republic and have not soberly assessed the situation in Germany and Europe.

Referring to Lloyd's claim that the policies of the German Democratic Republic were decided in Moscow, Gromyko pointed out that it was not the first time that some people insisted that the policies of the Soviet Union's allies were decided in Moscow. Gromyko said that, obviously, they were referring to the alignment of goals between the Soviet Union and these countries in foreign policy and in the cause of striving for peace and easing international tensions. The head of the Soviet delegation emphasized that, however, we Soviets are proud of the unity of action of these countries in the struggle for peace and easing international tensions. We are also proud that we are moving together towards a common goal – building socialist and communist societies in these countries.

Gromyko asked the representatives of the Western countries not to indulge in hostile feelings towards this or that country, including the German Democratic Republic, when discussing the All-German Committee issue.

Gromyko concluded: If I understand the situation correctly, then it can be said that my colleagues, including Mr. Herter, have expressed their readiness to exchange views on the issue of a temporary agreement on West Berlin. At the meeting on the 22nd, it was suggested that it would not be a bad idea to continue exchanging views on the issue of a temporary agreement on West Berlin in parallel with the issue of the All-German Committee and other feasible ways of negotiation between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. As for our Soviet delegation, we are ready to do so today or tomorrow, whenever it is convenient for the other foreign ministers.

German Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Bolz then spoke. He said that the policy of refusing negotiations between the two Germanys was bound to fail. He believed that it was possible for the participants in the conference to reach a solution that took into account the legitimate interests of all parties.

West German representative Grewe reiterated in a brief speech that the Bonn government's position of refusing any negotiations between the two Germanys remained unchanged.

The date of the next meeting will be decided later.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 23rd: Our correspondent Wan Guang reports: Since resuming the Geneva conference, the United States has taken a series of negative actions, and now it is clamoring again to interrupt or even break up the conference. In recent days, a chorus of threats and blackmail has been emanating from Washington to Geneva.

In the two weeks since the Foreign Ministers' Conference resumed, the United States has not put forward any constructive proposals. Now, after the United States, representing the Western countries, put forward a so-called "new proposal" on the 20th, the United States and its followers are clamoring that this is the "limit of concession," while in reality the United States has not moved an inch from its rigid position. Some Western newspapers have also bluntly called the West's "new proposal" "Adenauer's proposal," and Adenauer himself has made no secret of his opposition to reaching any agreement on West Berlin and the German question. When Herter put forward the Western proposal, he also said that it was an "effort" to cater to the Soviet Union, while the West German spokesman followed closely, saying that it was an "illusion" to think that the Soviet Union would accept the Western proposal that had the "endorsement" of West Germany.

In recent days, the US delegation in Geneva has held one secret press conference after another, repeatedly saying that the conference has "reached a deadlock" and that if the Soviet Union does not agree to discuss according to the Western line, the United States will "break up the conference." For reporters who participated in covering the first phase of the conference, this set of Chicago gangster's threats is not new.

It does not take much effort to discover the reason for Eisenhower and Herter's renewed outbursts of frenzy. The Pentagon in Washington and some monopoly consortia behind the building who are making a fortune from arms are stepping up their efforts to urge the United States to adopt a "tough stance" at the Geneva negotiating table. These forces in the United States are afraid that a conference agreement and a relaxation of the international situation will affect their "business."

However, the feeling inside and outside the Geneva venue is that the plans of some forces in the United States and West Germany to openly break up the conference are not currently receiving enthusiastic support from all Western countries. Some Western participants in the conference are weighing the weight of Gromyko's speech on the 22nd. In his speech, Gromyko said: "People are harboring the hope that the governments of the Western countries will assess in the most serious manner the consequences that may arise from the negative position they have adopted on this pressing issue (the peaceful settlement of the German question)."

### 外长会议上西方外长重弹旧调  葛罗米柯劝西方老老实实谈判  美国在会议内外大量制造“破裂会议”的空气

    外长会议上西方外长重弹旧调
    葛罗米柯劝西方老老实实谈判
    美国在会议内外大量制造“破裂会议”的空气
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦23日讯：在外长会议23日的全体会议上，西方三国的代表——劳埃德、赫脱和德姆维尔相继发言。
    在他们的发言中没有一点新东西，只是简单地重复了反对苏联关于建立全德委员会的建议的意见。而苏联和德意志民主共和国在前几次会议上就曾经指出，这些意见是毫无根据的。他们同时还大肆攻击德意志民主共和国。劳埃德硬说，德意志民主共和国的政策是“莫斯科”决定的。
    葛罗米柯在回答西方三国代表的这些发言时指出，西方代表不只一次地提出过反对苏联关于建立全德委员会或两个德国之间进行谈判的其他可行方式的建议的论据，反复搬用这些论据并不能使它们变得更有说服力，而仍然像过去一样站不住脚。其中许多论点证明，西方国家的代表在对待德意志民主共和国的态度方面是一味感情用事，而没有清醒地估计在德国和欧洲所形成的局势。
    在谈到劳埃德所谓德意志民主共和国的政策是在莫斯科决定的说法时，葛罗米柯指出，有些人总是硬说苏联的友邦的政策是在莫斯科决定的，这不是第一次了。葛罗米柯说，显然，他们所指的是苏联和这些国家在外交政策方面、在争取和平、争取缓和国际紧张局势的事业中的目标一致。苏联代表团团长着重指出，但是，我们苏联人为我们这些国家在争取和平、争取缓和国际紧张局势斗争中的行动一致感到自豪。我们还感到自豪的是，我们一起走向一个共同的目标——在我们这些国家中建成社会主义和共产主义社会。
    葛罗米柯要求西方国家的代表在讨论全德委员会问题时，不要对这个或那个国家，包括对德意志民主共和国在内，一味放纵敌视的感情。
    葛罗米柯最后说：如果我对情况理解正确的话，那么，可以这样说，我的同事们，其中包括赫脱先生，都表示准备就西柏林临时协定问题交换意见。在22日的会议上，已经有这样的意见：如果平行地就西柏林临时协定问题和全德委员会以及德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间的其他可行的谈判方式问题继续交换意见，将是一个不坏的主意。至于我们苏联代表团，无论今天或者明天，只要对其他外长们感到方便，我们都准备这样做。
    德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨接着发言。他说，拒绝两个德国之间进行谈判的政策必定遭到失败。他认为，会议参加者有可能取得一个考虑到各方合法利益的解决办法。
    西德代表格雷韦在简短的发言中重申，波恩政府拒绝两个德国进行任何谈判的立场是不变的。
    下次会议的日期以后再决定。
    据新华社日内瓦23日电　本社记者万光报道：美国自从在日内瓦复会后采取了一连串的否定性行动以后，目前又大嚷要再次中断以至破裂会议。这几天，从华盛顿到日内瓦此呼彼应地在发出一片威胁和讹诈的声音。
    外长会议复会两周来，美国没有提出任何建设性的建议。现在，在20日美国代表西方国家提出所谓
  “新建议”以后，美国及其跟随者叫嚷这已是“让步的极限”，而实际上美国并没有从其僵硬立场移开寸步。西方一些报刊也直截了当地把西方这个“新建议”称之为“阿登纳的建议”，而阿登纳自己却是毫不掩饰他是反对就西柏林及德国问题达成任何协议的。赫脱在提出西方建议时还说这是一个迎合苏联的“努力”，而西德发言人却紧跟着说，以为苏联会接受得到西德“赞同”的西方建议是“幻想”。
    在日内瓦的美国代表团这几天更是举行左一个右一个秘密记者招待会，一再说什么会议已“陷入僵局”，如果苏联不同意根据西方路线来讨论，美国就要“破裂会议”。对于参加过报道会议第一阶段的记者们来说，美国这一套芝加哥流氓的威胁手法，并不令人感到新鲜。
    人们无需费多大功夫就能够发现，艾森豪威尔和赫脱重新发作这种狂热的原因之所在。华盛顿的五角大楼和站在大楼后面的发军火财的一些垄断财团，正在加紧促使美国在日内瓦谈判桌上采取“强硬态度”。美国的这些势力害怕会议达成协议和国际局势趋向缓和，会影响他们的“事业”。
    但是，在日内瓦会场内外人们的感觉是，美国某些势力和西德想公然破裂会议的打算目前并没有得到所有西方国家的热烈支持。参加会议的某些西方国家人士正在衡量着葛罗米柯22日发言的分量。葛罗米柯在发言里说：“人们抱着这样一种希望：西方国家政府将以最认真的态度来估量一下由于它们在这个迫切问题（德国问题的和平解决）所采取的消极立场而可能引起的后果”。
