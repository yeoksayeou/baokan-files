Production and Scientific Research Promote Each Other
Significant Achievements in Mass Scientific Research by the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Second Engineering Company

    This newspaper reports that the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Second Engineering Company, by adopting a combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers, and focusing on production to carry out mass scientific research activities, has achieved remarkable results.
    This company is a civil engineering construction company, and the cultural level of the workers is very low, with a large proportion of new workers and apprentices. However, this year's tasks are quite heavy and arduous. Under the circumstances of difficult material supply, labor shortage, and weak technical strength, in order to continue to realize this year's Great Leap Forward, the company launched mass scientific and technological research activities while carrying out a production increase and economy practice movement centered on technical innovation.
    In carrying out mass scientific and technological research activities, this company used the needs of construction tasks to drive the development of scientific and technological research work, and used research results to promote and ensure the completion of construction tasks. According to the requirements of different periods and stages of construction, and to solve the problem of relatively scarce raw materials, they used the method of researching substitute raw materials, and successively completed research topics such as "using soil instead of ash," "using fiberglass instead of steel bars," and other "using old instead of new," and "using small instead of large." They successfully trial-produced more than ten kinds of substitute building materials such as straw-pressed fiberboard, waste wood profiling, bonded wood, and silicate products. These substitute materials not only saved the country a lot of raw materials, but also met the standards in terms of quality. Later, in order to change the status quo of manual operation, the workers carried out research activities on "using machinery to replace manual operation" in various types of work procedures, so that the construction process basically realized mechanization and semi-mechanization, greatly reducing labor intensity and improving labor productivity.
    The company has been able to achieve good results in research work mainly because it has conscientiously implemented the policy of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers. Leading cadres personally took charge of this work, and personally participated in solving problems on key issues or weak links in research work, which greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for research. In order to mobilize the masses, reasonable division of labor was carried out on research projects, and the company's efforts were combined with the construction site's efforts, using both foreign and local methods, and combining innovation and creation with learning and promotion. On key research projects, research was rationally divided according to the actual needs of production and the unit's original material and technical strength; in the research process, a pragmatic attitude was adopted, using foreign methods when possible, and local methods when foreign methods were not possible, to turn local methods into foreign methods. Innovation achievements and experience were promoted in a timely manner so that the majority of workers could apply and master the technology. In this way, the research interest of workers was improved, and work efficiency was improved. New topics were constantly raised in production, prompting workers to delve into research, and enabling scientific and technological research work to be carried out in depth. (Attached picture)

    生产和科学研究相互推动
    武钢第二工程公司群众性科学研究成绩显著
    本报讯　武汉钢铁公司第二工程公司，采取领导干部、技术人员、工人三结合，围绕生产进行群众性科学研究活动，取得了显著成果。
    这个公司是一个土木建筑公司，工人的文化水平很低，新工人和徒工占的比重很大。但今年担负的任务则相当繁重而艰巨。在材料供应困难、劳动力缺乏、技术力量薄弱的情况下，为了继续实现今年的大跃进，该公司在开展以技术革新为中心的增产节约运动时，掀起了群众性的科学技术研究活动。
    在开展群众性的科学技术研究活动中，这个公司以施工任务的需要带起科学技术研究工作的发展，又以研究成果促进并保证了施工任务的完成。他们根据施工不同时期、不同阶段的要求和解决比较缺乏的原材料，用研究代用原材料的方法，先后完成了“以土代灰”、“以玻璃丝代钢筋”，以及其他“以旧代新”、“以小代大”等研究课题，试制成功了稻草压制纤维板、废木定型、粘结木料、矽酸盐制品等十多种代用建筑材料。这些代用材料不仅为国家节省了大量原材料，而且质量都合乎标准。以后，为了改变手工操作现状，在各工种工序中，职工们又开展“用机械代替人工操作”的研究活动，使施工过程基本上实现了机械化半机械化，大大减低了劳动强度，提高了劳动生产率。
    这个公司能在研究工作中取得较好的成就，主要是认真贯彻领导干部、技术人员和工人的三结合方针。领导干部亲自抓这项工作，并在研究工作的关键问题或薄弱环节上，亲自参与解决问题，大大鼓舞了职工的钻研干劲。为了发动群众，在研究项目上进行了合理的分工，实行公司办与工地办并举，洋土并举，革新创造与学习推广并举。在重点研究项目上，根据生产实际需要与单位原有物质技术力量，合理分工研究；在研究过程中，采取实事求是态度，能洋就洋，不洋就土，使土化洋。及时推广革新成就和经验，使广大职工能应用、掌握技术。这样，提高了职工研究兴趣，提高了工效；生产中又不断地提出新的课题，促使职工深入地钻研，使科学技术研究工作深入地开展。（附图片）
