Academic and Cultural Trends

    The Soviet Union has made great progress in machine translation research. Since the successful English-Russian machine translation experiment in 1955, the number of research units has increased from two to more than ten, the number of languages studied has increased from two to more than twenty, and the translation between multiple languages has been studied. The Soviet Union convened the All-Union Machine Translation Conference last May, and the All-Union Mathematical Linguistics Conference this April, which specifically studied machine translation issues. Leningrad University established a major in mathematical linguistics in 1958 to train experts in mathematical linguistics. Other universities have also opened machine translation courses and are preparing to establish mathematical linguistics majors. In recent years, the Soviet Union has also focused on the theoretical research of machine translation.

    苏联对机器翻译的研究取得很大进展
    苏联在机器翻译的研究工作方面，近几年来取得了很大进展。1955年英俄机器翻译实验成功后，研究单位已从两个增加到十多个，研究的语言已从两种增加到二十几种，并且研究了多种语言之间的翻译问题。去年5月间苏联曾召开了全苏机器翻译会议，今年4月又召开了全苏数理语言学会议，专门研究了机器翻译问题。1958年列宁格勒大学曾为此设立了数理语言学专业，培养数理语言学专家，另外一些高等学校也开设了机器翻译课，并准备成立数理语言学专业。近年来苏联还着重于机器翻译的理论研究。
