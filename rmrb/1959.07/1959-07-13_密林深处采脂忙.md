Deep in the hinterland of the Lesser Khingan Mountains in Heilongjiang Province, a new production project is attracting increasingly widespread interest. This is the extraction of resin and the refining of rosin.

　　Resin Extraction Experts

Summer is the golden season for collecting pine resin. In order to prepare enough raw materials for the large-scale refining of rosin, the workers of the Fenglin Forestry Bureau have launched a surge of resin extraction.

On June 24th, in a dense pine forest, a group of young resin extractors were working among the trees. The two young men in the lead were the most enthusiastic. They busily peeled off the pine bark with shovels, carved grooves into the tree trunks with scrapers to create resin flow channels, and then tied small tin cans to the base of the trees as resin collectors. These two young men were named Yang Yulin and Song Jingzhi.

Because they knew that rosin was an important industrial raw material urgently needed by the country, they worked with great enthusiasm. Yang Yulin, based on the fact that pine trees produce more resin in hot weather, created a method of extracting resin by carving grooves on the sunny side, which increased the amount of resin flow; others collected less than two qian of resin per box per day, while he collected two and a half or three qian of resin per box per day. In the past, Xiao Yang and Xiao Song collected less than one kilogram of resin per day, but now they can easily collect more than two kilograms of resin. To this day, no one in the Fenglin Forestry Area's resin extraction team has been able to match this number!

　　Frugally Refining Rosin

Beside the Tangwang River. On an open space near the forest railway, there is a row of simple factory buildings, which is the Fenglin Bureau's comprehensive wood utilization processing plant. This plant was built not long ago, and currently, in addition to producing crate planks, fiberboard, turpentine, tannin extract, pine needle oil, and other products, it also produces rosin. Here, the spirit of running enterprises frugally is evident everywhere. The equipment used for producing rosin consists of a small shed made of reed mats, with a small stove made of mud inside the shed, and an old aluminum pot formerly used for serving food placed on top. With these simple tools, they can refine ten to twenty jin of rosin every day.

Currently, six of the bureau's seven logging farms have started simple rosin processing plants, and the equipment they use is roughly similar. Workers at the First Forestry Farm sew small pockets out of birch bark to replace iron resin collectors; they pick up old sickle heads to carve grooves and extract resin since they don't have specialized scrapers; and they use copper washbasins and aluminum lunch boxes instead of standard distillation equipment because they don't have those. They have simply managed with whatever they could find, doing everything possible to get their hands on rosin.

　　Delivering Goods in the Rain

In mid-June, resin extraction at the Fenglin Bureau's First Forestry Farm had just begun when they encountered difficulties such as a shortage of scrapers and resin collectors. In particular, the newly formed resin extraction shock team faced many inconveniences because they lacked raincoats and mosquito hats. Mosquitoes and gnats often bit the resin extractors' faces and hands, hindering the improvement of resin extraction efficiency.

When the commercial section of the Wuying District, where the Fenglin Bureau is located, learned of this situation, they immediately held a meeting and decided to deliver goods to the mountains.

On the day scheduled for going up the mountain, strong winds stirred the clouds on the horizon, and heavy rain was about to fall. Cui, the head of the commercial section, advised everyone, "There will be a storm today, and the road is far and slippery. Let's go another day." However, the girls and young men kept packing things into麻袋 (ma dai, sacks) and preparing to set off. After finishing packing, Zhou Xiangxia, a member of the Communist Youth League, straightened up and said to Cui, "What's there to be afraid of rain and wind? The forestry workers are extracting resin in the forest all day long, and the gnats have swollen their faces. What's wrong with us getting a little rain while delivering goods? We must carry out the original plan and deliver the goods to the mountains!" The others shouted in unison, "That's right! We can't break our promise."

They set off, and the sky began to drizzle. More than ten of them carried sacks, climbed mountains, and crossed ridges along the forest path towards the First Forestry Farm. Halfway there, strong winds and heavy rain descended from the sky, and in an instant, everyone was soaked. Their clothes clung tightly to their bodies, their hair stuck to their faces, and the dense raindrops blocked people's view forward. However, this group of young people did not diminish their enthusiasm for delivering goods, and each marched forward with their heads held high, rushing to the First Forestry Farm.

When they delivered the goods to the forestry farm in the rain, the forestry workers baked their clothes, provided them with water for washing their faces, and warmly welcomed them. They also introduced them to the situation of resin extraction and rosin refining.

    密林深处采脂忙
    高红书　齐信
    在黑龙江省小兴安岭腹部，一个新的生产项目，越来越广泛地吸引着人们的兴趣。这就是采脂和炼制松香。
        采脂能手
    夏天，正是采集松脂的黄金季节。为了给大炼松香准备足够的原料，丰林林业局的工人掀起了突击采脂的热潮。
    6月24日，在一片密集的松林里，一群年轻的采脂者劳动在林间。为首的那两个小伙子干的最欢。他们一边忙着用铲刀把松树皮扒掉，一边用刮刀在树干上掏出一道道的流脂沟，然后再把小罐头盒绑在树根上，这是受脂器。这两个小伙子一个叫杨玉林，一个叫宋景之。
    由于他们知道松香是国家急需的重要工业原料，工作起来积极性很高。杨玉林根据热天松树脂多的情况，创造了向阳面掏沟取脂的方法，提高了流脂量；别人一天一个盒受脂不到两钱，而他一天一个盒受脂达两钱半或三钱。过去小杨和小宋一天采脂不到一公斤，现在平平常常地也能采脂两公斤以上。这个数字，在丰林林区采脂队伍中至今还没有人赶得上呢！
      勤俭炼松香
    汤旺河边。在靠近森林铁路的一片空场上，有一排简易的厂房，这是丰林局木材综合利用加工厂。这个厂建成不久，目前除了生产箱板材、纤维板、松节油、栲胶、松针油等产品外，也生产松香。在这里，勤俭办企业的精神到处可见。生产松香所用的设备，总共不过是搭了个小席棚，席棚里用泥土砌了个小火灶，上边坐一口过去盛饭用的旧铝盆。他们就用这些家当，每天能炼制出一二十斤松香。
    目前，这个局七个采伐林场已有六个林场搞起松香简易加工厂，他们所用的设备大体上相似。第一林场工人用桦树皮缝成小兜兜代替铁质受脂器；没有特制刮刀就拣旧镰刀头掏沟取脂；没有标准蒸馏器具，工人就用铜脸盆、铝饭盆代替。他们就是这样因陋就简，千方百计地把松香弄到手。
        冒雨送货
    6月中旬，丰林局第一林场采脂刚刚开始，遇到了刮刀、受脂器等工具不足的困难。特别是新组成的采脂突击队，因为没有雨衣和蚊帽，工作有许多不便之处。蚊蠓、小咬常把采脂工人的脸和手叮肿，妨碍着采脂效率的提高。
    这一情况被丰林局所在地——五营区的商业科知道了，他们马上召开会议，决定送货上山。
    在预定上山那天，狂风吹动着天边的云团，大雨就要降临了。商业科崔科长劝大家说：“今天有暴风雨，道远路滑改日再去吧。”但是，姑娘和小伙子们还是不停地往麻袋里装东西，准备起程。共青团员周向霞装完货，直起腰来对崔科长说：“下雨刮风怕啥，人家林业工人整天在林子里采脂，叫小咬把脸都叮肿了，咱们送货挨点雨水浇怕什么，说啥也得执行原来计划，送货上山！”别的人也异口同声地喊：“对！咱们不能失信用。”
    出发了，天空开始下着稀稀拉拉的雨点。他们十多个人抗着麻袋，顺着林中小路，攀山过岭向第一林场走去。行至中途，狂风夹着大雨从天而降，刹那间，每个人都成了水人。衣服紧贴在身上，头发糊在脸上，密麻麻的雨点把人们前进的视线都给挡住了。但是，这帮青年人没有减低一点送货的兴致，个个昂首阔步，向第一林场急行。
    当他们冒雨把货送到林场时，林业工人们给他们烤衣服，打洗脸水，热烈欢迎他们，并且向他们介绍了采脂和炼制松香的情况。
