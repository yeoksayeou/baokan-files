To Carefully Calculate Fertilizer Needs for Increased Autumn Production
    Sanmao Commune Members Plan Fertilizer Accumulation and Topdressing According to Crop Variety and Soil Quality
    Nanjing, July 7th (reporting from this newspaper) - The Tenth Production Team of the Hero Management Area of the Sanmao Commune in Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, after the basic completion of summer planting, has made a comprehensive plan for topdressing based on the variety of autumn-ripening crops and their different growth needs, and has actively taken effective measures to accumulate and apply fertilizer to ensure that the needs of large-scale increased production of autumn-ripening crops are fully met.
    Of the sixty-eight mu of paddy fields in this production team, thirty-four mu are of the fertilizer-tolerant "Yellow Shell Early" variety, and the other half are of the less fertilizer-tolerant "Mang Gang Rice" and "Glutinous Rice" varieties. Among the team's paddy fields, ten mu are yellow soil fields with a hard soil texture, planted with "Gang Rice," and each mu is fertilized with 4,000 jin of green manure (base fertilizer); forty-five mu are sandy loam with better soil quality, of which twenty mu use grass-mud as base fertilizer, at 300 dan per mu; ten mu were fertilized with river mud, at 400 dan per mu; ten mu were fertilized with pig ash, at 120 dan per mu; and five mu were planted in white soil. All these fields are planted with "Yellow Shell Early," "Mang Gang Rice," "Glutinous Rice" and other varieties. In addition, thirteen mu of nursery beds were fertilized with 4,000 jin of green manure, watered with human waste, and applied with pig ash before transplanting seedlings, so no base fertilizer was applied during transplanting.
    Based on the need for topdressing throughout the entire growth period of rice, the fertilizer tolerance of the crops, and the different conditions of base fertilizer application, the team cadres and the masses formulated a topdressing plan for autumn ripening: Fields with sufficient base fertilizer will be fertilized with nitrogen fertilizer once a month after transplanting, and with phosphorus and potassium fertilizer once during heading; white soil fields without base fertilizer need to be fertilized three times, once with human waste, once with pig ash, and once with phosphorus and potassium fertilizer; nursery fields only need two topdressings. According to this requirement, the team's sixty-eight mu of paddy fields require a total of 7,000 dan of artificial liquid fertilizer, 500 dan of human manure and urine, 700 dan of pig ash, 680 dan of soil fertilizer, and 28 dan of plant ash.
    The sources of these fertilizers are: First, vigorously develop artificial liquid fertilizer ponds. The raw materials for artificial liquid fertilizer are mainly green grass, leaves, sewage, and some livestock manure. Each composting takes only seven to ten days, after which it can be applied to the fields. Second, accumulate human manure and urine. Except for a portion reserved for irrigating private plots, the team's manure and urine can accumulate 150 dan, and there is already a stockpile of more than 150 dan of feces. In addition, a contract has been signed with a nearby machinery factory to collect manure, which can accumulate a total of 500 dan of human manure and urine. Third, vigorously develop pig farming to accumulate fertilizer. The team currently has twenty-seven pigs, which will reach fifty by mid-July. More than 500 dan of pig ash can be accumulated in one and a half months, and with the 400 dan of pig ash already stockpiled, a total of more than 900 dan of pig ash can be accumulated, greatly exceeding the required amount. Fourth, since Yangzhong is a water network area, there are many snails and clam shells, which can be used to produce a large amount of soil fertilizer.
    To realize this plan, the team's labor force has been properly arranged. Field management and fertilizer accumulation and production are the responsibility of specific personnel.
    At present, the team is both vigorously engaged in the movement to accumulate and produce fertilizer, and has begun to topdress according to the growth of the rice. (Wang Miao)

    为秋季增产细算肥料账
    三茅公社社员按作物品种土质有计划积肥追肥
    本报南京7日电　江苏省扬中县三茅公社英雄管理区第十生产队，在夏种基本结束以后，根据秋熟作物的品种和生长的不同需要，作了追肥的全面规划，并积极采取有效措施积肥追肥，保证充分满足秋熟作物大面积增产的需要。
    这个生产队的六十八亩稻田中，有三十四亩是耐肥的黄壳早品种，另一半是不耐肥的芒刚稻和糯稻品种。全队稻田有十亩是黄土田，土质板，栽的是刚稻，每亩施绿肥（基肥）四千斤；有四十五亩是夹沙土，土质较好，其中有二十亩用草块泥作基肥，每亩三百担；有十亩下了河泥，每亩四百担；有十亩下了猪灰，每亩一百二十担，还有五亩是白田下种。这些田，全部栽的黄壳早、芒刚稻、糯稻等品种。还有十三亩秧池，下秧前施了四千斤绿肥，浇了人粪，下了猪灰，因此栽秧时没有再下基肥。
    根据整个水稻生长期对追肥的需要，作物耐肥的程度，和施基肥的不同情况，全队干部和群众制订了秋熟追肥的规划：施足基肥的田，栽秧后一个月施一次氮肥，在抽穗时施一次磷、钾肥；未施基肥的白田，需要施三次肥，一次是人粪，一次是猪灰，一次是磷、钾肥；秧田只需追施两次肥料。根据这一要求，全队六十八亩稻田共需人造水粪七千担，人粪尿五百担，猪灰七百担，土化肥六百八十担，草木灰二十八担。
    这些肥料的来源：第一、大搞人造水粪塘。人造水粪的原料主要是青草、树叶、污水和部分牲畜粪。每次沤制，只需要七天到十天时间，就可以施到田里。第二、积聚人粪尿。全队的粪尿，除留一部分浇自留田以外，尿可以积聚一百五十担，现有存粪一百五十多担，加上已和附近的机械厂订立收粪合同，共可积聚人粪尿五百担。第三、大搞养猪积肥。全队现有生猪二十七头，到7月中旬可达五十头，一个半月可积猪灰五百担以上，加上现在积存猪灰四百担，共可积聚猪灰九百多担，大大超过需要量。第四、由于扬中是水网地区，螺蛳、蚌壳很多，可以大造土化肥。
    为了实现这一规划，全队劳力已作了妥善安排。田间管理，积肥造肥都有专人负责。
    现在，全队一面在大搞积肥造肥运动，一面已经开始根据稻子生长的情况，进行追肥。　（王淼）
