Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 1st: The No. 3 generating unit of China's first underground power station, the Gutian Hydropower Station in Fujian Province, began generating electricity on June 30th. This unit has a capacity of 12,500 kilowatts and is the first unit in the first-stage, second-phase project of the Gutian Hydropower Station.

The Gutian Hydropower Station is built on the Gutian River, a tributary of the Min River, originating in Pingnan County and flowing into the Min River in Minqing County, with a total length of 110 kilometers. Its development project is divided into four stages. The first-stage, first-phase project was completed in March 1956 and supplies electricity to cities and industrial areas such as Fuzhou and Nanping.

Xinhua News Agency: In order to welcome the peak flood season for power generation, the Fengman Hydropower Station in Northeast China has carried out equipment overhaul work, which is now basically completed.

According to practice, the equipment of Fengman Hydropower Station is overhauled every two to three years to ensure safe operation. The low-water period of the Songhua River from 1958 to 1959 was relatively long, which provided favorable conditions for the overhaul work. The overhaul workers made full use of this condition to conduct a comprehensive inspection and overhaul of all equipment; the key overhaul items were the flood control dam, generator units, speed control devices, power distribution and transformation devices, relay protection devices, and automation devices. In order not to affect normal power generation, the overhaul work adopted the method of "defeating them one by one," with each unit being overhauled in rotation.

Currently, the overhauled units are awaiting the increasingly imminent flood peak of the Songhua River. It is expected that by mid-July, the water level of the Fengman Reservoir will rise to the predetermined elevation. The powerful generator units will then begin full-load operation.

The Liuxi River Hydropower Station in Guangdong Province, which was completed last August, has already withstood the test of a particularly large flood. The hydropower station's flood control dam stored 184 million cubic meters of floodwater, greatly reducing the threat of flooding to the downstream banks of the Liuxi River and Guangzhou. This is the flood control dam discharging floodwater in a controlled manner. Photo by Wang Jian (Xinhua News Agency draft)

### 古田电站又一机组发电  丰满水电站检修设备准备满负荷运转

    古田电站又一机组发电
    丰满水电站检修设备准备满负荷运转
    据新华社福州1日电　我国第一座地下电站——福建省古田水电站的三号机组已在6月30日开始发电。这个机组的容量一万二千五百瓩，是古田水电站一级二期工程中的第一个机组。
    古田水电站建设在古田溪上。古田溪是闽江支流，由屏南县发源。至闽清县注入闽江，全长一百一十公里。它的开发工程共分四级。一级一期工程已经在1956年3月完工，为福州、南平等城市和工业区供应电力。
    据新华社讯　为了迎接洪峰大发电季节的到来，东北丰满水电站进行了设备检修工作。这次检修，目前已经基本结束。
    按照惯例，丰满水电站的设备每隔两三年要进行一次大修，以保证安全运行。1958年至1959年度松花江枯水期较长，这给检修工作带来了有利条件。检修工人们充分利用这个条件，对全部设备都进行了大清查、大检修；重点检修项目是拦洪大坝，发电机组，调速装置，配电变电装置，继电保护装置和自动化装置等。为了不影响正常发电，检修工作采取了“个个击破”的办法，逐台逐台地轮流进行检修。
    目前，经过检修的机组正在等待日益迫近的松花江洪峰。预计7月中旬，丰满水库的水位将上升到预定标高。出力强大的发电机组，就要开始满负荷运转了。（附图片）
    去年八月建成的广东省流溪河水电站，已经受了特大洪水的考验。水电站的拦洪坝，拦蓄了一亿八千四百万公方的洪水，大大地减轻了洪水对流溪河下游两岸以及广州市的威胁。这是拦洪坝正在有节制地洩洪。　王健摄（新华社稿）
