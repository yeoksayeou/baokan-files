	Bi-Weekly International Review
	July 1st to 15th
		The Bumper Harvest of Socialist Countries
	In socialist countries, it is the season of bumper harvests. From these countries come frequent reports of success, with working people completing their production plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. Compared with the same period last year, the total industrial output value in the first half of this year increased by 12% in the Soviet Union, 75% in Korea, 23.4% in Bulgaria, about 9% in Hungary, 12.4% in the German Democratic Republic, and more than 11% in Czechoslovakia and 8.3% in Mongolia. Poland's major industrial sectors completed the first half of the year's production tasks ahead of schedule. Albania's industrial and mining enterprises also achieved significant success in the first half of the year. In the first five months of this year, Romania overfulfilled its production plans by 3.5% in the heavy industry sector, 2.2% in the light industry sector, and 5.7% in the food industry. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has had an unprecedented bumper harvest of summer rice, and the construction sector's work in the first five months exceeded the entire previous year. In the first half of this year, the agricultural cooperativization movement in Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Vietnam, and the agricultural and pastoral cooperativization movement in Mongolia have all made important progress. What exciting news!
	Naturally, the achievement of these major successes is not accidental. The beautiful prospects shown by these countries' plans to accelerate the construction of socialism and communism have greatly encouraged the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the working people. The Soviet people are to complete the Seven-Year Plan in six years or less. The Korean people are to complete the First Five-Year Plan two years and four months ahead of schedule. The Bulgarian people are to complete the Five-Year Plan in three or four years. The Hungarian people are to complete the Three-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. In order to complete the plans for the development of the national economy ahead of schedule, the working people of all countries have launched a magnificent socialist competition. In the Soviet Union, socialist competition has formed a national technological innovation movement. In Eastern Europe, the working people of Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, and Albania are pushing socialist competition to a new climax in order to greet the tenth and fifteenth anniversaries of their founding. In Asia, the Korean people are also launching a competition to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule to greet the "August 15th" Liberation Day, and have already completed the Five-Year Plan's total industrial output value plan two years and six months ahead of schedule by the end of June. In these competitions, the working people of all countries have brought their energy into play, tapped their potential, innovated technology, increased output and quality, and increased labor productivity, thus exceeding the completion of their production plans for the first half of the year.
	In the labor competitions of socialist countries, the movement to establish "Communist Labor Brigades" in the Soviet Union and the movement to establish "Socialist Labor Brigades" in other socialist countries (called the "Chollima Work Team" movement in Korea) are playing a vanguard role. They put forward the bold slogan: "Work, study, and live in the Communist (or Socialist) way." They stand in the vanguard of the competition movement, powerfully promoting the competition movement.
	In the competition movement, many people with communist style have emerged, such as the Soviet spinning worker Valia Gaganova. Gaganova's moving story of voluntarily transferring from an advanced work team to a backward work team to help improve the work has spread throughout the Soviet Union, inspiring the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the Soviet communist builders. From this, it can be seen that the labor competition in socialist countries, especially the movement to establish "Communist Labor Brigades" and "Socialist Labor Brigades," not only improves the level of production, but also improves people's ideological awareness—a bumper harvest in both production and thought!
	At present, the labor competition in socialist countries is continuing to develop. Recently, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU called on all working people in the Soviet Union to widely carry out a national socialist competition to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule and for technological innovation. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party decided to widely carry out a mass movement to develop animal husbandry and a national movement to build power stations. The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party held a plenary session and put forward the task of further developing agriculture. The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers have made specific measures to expand the irrigated area. In the face of these new tasks, the labor competition in socialist countries will develop even more grandly.
		Soviet Achievements Shocked the United States
	What should be especially mentioned here are the tremendous achievements of the Soviet Union in developing its national economy, especially the tremendous achievements of the Soviet Union in developing science and technology.
	The Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy of the Soviet Union, which opened in Moscow in the middle of last month, is a major event in the lives of the Soviet people. The 100,000 large exhibits and countless other exhibits displayed in the seventy-one exhibition halls of this exhibition show the latest achievements of the Soviet Union in the development of industry, agriculture, construction, transportation, science and technology, and culture, reflecting the great wisdom and creativity of the Soviet people, and demonstrating the brilliant prospects of the Seven-Year Plan.
	At the end of last month, the Soviet Exhibition of Scientific, Technological, and Cultural Achievements also opened in New York. The approximately 10,000 exhibits of this exhibition introduced to the American people the outstanding achievements of the Soviet Union in science, atomic energy, radio electronics, industry, agriculture, education, health care, culture, residential construction, and people's welfare, enabling the American people to see through the exhibition the grand prospects of Soviet communist construction and the sincere desire of the Soviet people for peace. This exhibition was welcomed by people from all walks of life in the United States. In the first week of its opening, more than 300,000 people had come to visit. This exhibition surprised those Americans who were ignorant of the Soviet Union due to the deceptive propaganda of the American ruling group. After visiting the exhibition, a New York audience wrote in the guestbook: "I know that the Soviet Union has made great achievements in technology, but everything I saw here today surprised me. I didn't know you had gone so far." And American newspapers and news agencies could not but admit that the exhibition was an "attractive and convincing exhibition" ("New York Herald Tribune"), a "display of confidence and pride" (Associated Press).
	On July 2 and 10, the Soviet Union successfully launched high-altitude geophysical ballistic rockets with experimental animals twice, and the instruments and experimental animals carried were safely returned to the ground. This is another new major achievement of Soviet science and technology. One of the characteristics of this new experiment is that the total load of scientific instruments and animals on the rocket is more than 2,000 kilograms. "The New York Times" also admitted: "From a rocket technology perspective, the huge payload is the most important aspect of some of the recent Soviet spaceflights...This is the largest weight that has been launched into space." In addition, the complexity of the scientific tasks undertaken by the rocket and the ability of the instruments it carries to return safely to the ground are also important characteristics of these new experiments.
	The tremendous achievements made by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in developing their national economies, and the tremendous achievements made by the Soviet Union in science and technology, especially in ballistic rockets, demonstrate that the socialist world system is advancing victoriously in the peaceful competition with the capitalist world system.
	The countries of the socialist camp have always advocated peaceful coexistence with capitalist countries. The recent visit of Soviet First Deputy Premier Kozlov to the United States also demonstrated the Soviet Union's major efforts in improving Soviet-American relations and promoting Soviet-American peaceful coexistence. During his visit to the United States, Kozlov called for: "Let us compete in the production of meat, milk, and consumer goods! This kind of competition is good for the Soviet people, the American people, and the people of all countries." However, American propaganda agencies are painstakingly belittling the great significance of the Soviet Exhibition of Scientific, Technological, and Cultural Achievements and Kozlov's visit to the United States. This can only show that the American ruling group is afraid of the great achievements of the Soviet Union and afraid of peace.
		Cuban People Oppose American Intervention
	In the Caribbean region of Latin America, American imperialism has stepped up its intervention activities. On July 1, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower personally came forward and formally released the signal to start the machinery of the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the affairs of various countries in the Caribbean region. With malicious intentions, he clamored that "since Fidel Castro has absolute control over the Cuban government and regime, the Caribbean region has been in a state of turbulence," and he unequivocally designated the "Organization of American States" to "find reasons to take action." Sure enough, the next day, the "Organization of American States" held a Council meeting in Washington, and the loyal running dog of the United States—the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic—immediately provided "reasons to take action" in accordance with Eisenhower's instructions, claiming that the Dominican people's anti-dictatorial armed struggle was an "international event" "instigated" by Cuba that "invades the territory," and demanded that the "Organization of American States" intervene. Under the coercion of the United States, the "Organization of American States" decided on July 13 to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of the 21 American countries to discuss the so-called "tension in the Caribbean region."
	It is not uncommon for the United States to use the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. But it is unprecedented for the U.S. President to personally launch this machine this time. This shows that the storms of the Cuban revolution and the anti-dictatorial struggles of the people of Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic have greatly shaken the American ruling group, forcing the U.S. President to personally come forward.
	According to reports from all sides, the United States' intervention activities in the Caribbean region are proceeding simultaneously on three fronts. The first is to exert tremendous political and economic pressure on the Cuban revolutionary regime, attempting to force the Cuban government to deviate from the path of national democratic revolution. The second is to use the "Organization of American States" to place the "crime" of "creating turbulence in the Caribbean region" on Cuba, so that it can "have a good reason" when carrying out armed intervention in Cuba. The third is to actively build a "police force" of the "Organization of American States," both as the main force for armed aggression against Cuba and to help the dictatorial regimes of Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic suppress the people's anti-dictatorial armed uprisings; at the same time, it is actively arming Cuban counter-revolutionaries and inciting the Dominican dictatorial regime to organize so-called "foreign volunteer troops" as auxiliary forces for the invasion of Cuba.
	These shameless and blatant intervention activities of the United States have aroused great anger among the people of Latin America, and a magnificent anti-intervention struggle is unfolding throughout Latin America. The Cuban revolutionary government, headed by Castro, with the unanimous support of the Cuban people, responded to the shameless intervention of U.S. imperialism by continuing to severely suppress counter-revolutionaries and resolutely implementing land reform. Prime Minister Castro severely condemned the United States' trick of convening a meeting of foreign ministers of American countries to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs, and announced that the Cuban people will resolutely defend their motherland. The United States' conspiracy to interfere in Cuba and other countries through the "Organization of American States" cannot be hidden from the people of Latin America. The public opinion of Latin American countries unanimously pointed out that any intervention by the "Organization of American States" in the Caribbean region is an intervention by the United States. In many Latin American countries, not only are the broad masses of people protesting against the intervention activities of the United States, but many officials have also expressed their opposition to using the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the internal affairs of American countries.
	This struggle between intervention and anti-intervention is continuing to develop. All signs indicate that the United States will not withdraw its intervention activities in the face of the huge anti-intervention movement. Of course, this can only prompt the people of Latin American countries to unite more closely and carry out a more resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism.

    半月国际述评
    7月1日至15日
        社会主义国家的丰收
    在社会主义国家，这是丰收的季节。从这些国家里纷纷传来捷报，劳动人民提前完成了今年上半年的生产计划。与去年同期比较，今年上半年苏联工业总产值增长12％，朝鲜增长75％，保加利亚增长23.4％，匈牙利约增长9％，德意志民主共和国增长12.4％，捷克斯洛伐克增长11％以上，蒙古增长8.3％。波兰主要工业部门提前完成了上半年生产任务。阿尔巴尼亚工矿企业上半年也获得了显著的成就。罗马尼亚今年头五个月重工业部门超额3.5％、轻工业部门超额2.2％、食品工业超额5.7％完成了生产计划。越南民主共和国夏稻获得空前丰收，头五个月建筑业部门的工作就超过去年全年。今年上半年，匈牙利、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、越南的农业合作化运动和蒙古的农牧业合作化运动都有了重要的进展。这是多么令人兴奋的消息！
    自然，这些重大的成就的取得并不是偶然的。这些国家加速建设社会主义和共产主义的计划所展示的美好的远景，大大地鼓舞了劳动人民的政治热情和劳动热情。苏联人民要在六年或更短的时间里完成七年计划。朝鲜人民要提前两年又四个月完成第一个五年计划。保加利亚人民要在三、四年内完成五年计划。匈牙利人民要提前一年完成三年计划。为了提前完成发展国民经济计划，各国劳动人民纷纷掀起波澜壮阔的社会主义竞赛。在苏联，社会主义竞赛已经形成一个全民性的技术革新运动。在东欧，波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、德意志民主共和国和阿尔巴尼亚的劳动人民，为了迎接国庆十周年和十五周年，正在把社会主义竞赛推向一个新的高潮。在亚洲，朝鲜人民也正在展开提前完成五年计划的竞赛来迎接“八·一五”解放日，并且已经在6月底提前两年六个月完成了五年计划的工业总产值计划。在这些竞赛中，各国劳动人民发挥干劲，挖掘潜力，革新技术，提高产量和质量，提高劳动生产率，因而额超完成了上半年的生产计划。
    在社会主义各国的劳动竞赛中，苏联建立“共产主义劳动队”的运动，和其他社会主义国家建立“社会主义劳动队”的运动（在朝鲜叫做“千里马作业组”运动），起着先锋的作用。他们提出豪迈的口号：“按照共产主义（或社会主义）的方式工作、学习和生活”。他们站在竞赛运动的先列，有力地推进了竞赛运动。
    在竞赛运动中，涌现了许多具有共产主义风格的人，例如苏联纺纱女工瓦利亚·加加诺娃就是其中的一个。加加诺娃自愿从先进的工作队转到落后的工作队去帮助搞好工作的动人事迹，已经传遍了全苏联，鼓舞了苏联共产主义建设者的政治热情和劳动热情。从这里可以看到：社会主义各国的劳动竞赛，特别是建立“共产主义劳动队”和“社会主义劳动队”的运动，不仅提高了生产水平，而且也提高人们的思想觉悟——生产思想两丰收！
    目前，社会主义国家的劳动竞赛正在继续发展。最近，苏共中央全会号召苏联全体劳动人民为提前完成七年计划、为技术革新而广泛开展全民性的社会主义竞赛。朝鲜劳动党中央全会，决定要广泛开展发展畜牧业的群众运动和建设发电站的全民运动。波兰统一工人党中央举行了全会，提出了进一步发展农业的任务。保共中央和部长会议作出了扩大灌溉面积的具体措施。在这些新的任务的面前，社会主义各国的劳动竞赛将更加规模壮阔地向前发展。
      苏联成就震动了美国
    这里应该特别谈到的是苏联发展国民经济的巨大成就，尤其是苏联发展科学技术的巨大成就。
    上月中旬在莫斯科开幕的苏联国民经济成就展览会，是苏联人民生活中的一件大事。这个展览会的七十一个展览馆中展出的十万件大型展品和无数其他展品，显示了苏联在发展工业、农业、建筑业、运输业、科学技术和文化方面的最新的成就，反映了苏联人民的伟大智慧和创造力，展现了七年计划的光辉灿烂的前景。
    上月底，苏联科学、技术、文化成就展览会也在纽约开幕了。这个展览会的大约一万件展品，向美国人民介绍了苏联在科学、原子能、无线电子学、工业、农业、教育、卫生保健、文化、住宅建筑和人民福利方面的杰出的成就，使美国人民通过展览会，能够看到苏联共产主义建设的宏伟前景和苏联人民对和平的真诚愿望。这个展览会受到美国各界人民的欢迎。在开幕的头一个星期里，已经有三十万以上的人前来参观。这个展览会使那些由于美国统治集团的欺骗宣传而对苏联无知的美国人感到惊讶。一个纽约观众在参观了这个展览会以后在留言簿上写道：“我知道苏联在技术方面取得了很大的成就，可是今天在这里看到的一切使我很惊讶，我还不知道你们原来走了那么远了。”而美国的报纸和通讯社也不能不承认，这个展览会是“吸引人的、有说服力的展览”（“纽约先驱论坛报”），是“信心和自豪感的展示”（美联社）。
    7月2日和10日，苏联两次成功地发射了带有试验动物的高空地球物理弹道火箭，所载仪器和试验动物都安全返回地面。这是苏联科学技术又一新的重大成就。这次新试验的特点之一是：火箭上的科学仪器和动物的总载重量都在两千公斤以上。“纽约时报”也承认：“从火箭技术上来看，巨大的有效荷重是苏联最近一些宇宙飞行的最重要的一面……这是已经发射到宇宙中去的最大的重量。”此外，火箭所负科学任务十分复杂及其所载仪器能够安全返回地面，也是这些新试验的重要特点。
    苏联和其他社会主义国家在发展国民经济方面所取得的巨大成就，苏联在科学技术方面，特别是在弹道火箭方面所取得的巨大成就，说明了社会主义世界体系在同资本主义世界体系的和平竞赛中正在胜利前进。
    社会主义阵营各国一直主张同资本主义国家和平共处。苏联部长会议第一副主席科兹洛夫最近在美国的访问，也表现了苏联在改善苏美两国关系，促进苏美和平共处方面的重大努力。科兹洛夫在访美时曾经呼吁：“让我们在生产肉类、牛奶和消费品方面展开竞赛吧！这种竞赛对苏联人民、美国人民和各国人民都有好处。”可是美国的宣传机构却正在心劳日拙地贬低苏联科学、技术、文化成就展览会和科兹洛夫访美的重大意义。这只能说明美国统治集团害怕苏联的巨大成就，害怕和平。
      古巴人民反对美国干涉
    在拉丁美洲的加勒比海地区，美帝国主义加紧了它的干涉活动。7月1日，美国总统艾森豪威尔亲自出面，正式放出了开动“美洲国家组织”的机器来干涉加勒比海地区各国事务的信号。他用心险恶地扬言“自从菲德尔·卡斯特罗绝对控制了古巴政府和政权起，加勒比海地区就处在动荡不安的状态中”，他毫不含糊地指定
  “美洲国家组织”去“找到采取行动的理由”。果不其然，第二天，“美洲国家组织”就在华盛顿召开理事会会议，美国的忠实走狗——多米尼加的特鲁希略独裁政权——马上就按照艾森豪威尔的指示提供了“采取行动的理由”，把多米尼加人民的反独裁武装斗争说成是由古巴“策动”的一个“侵犯领土”的“国际事件”，要求“美洲国家组织”进行干涉。在美国的强制下，“美洲国家组织”已于7月13日决定召开美洲二十一国外长会议来讨论所谓“加勒比海地区的紧张局势”。
    美国利用“美洲国家组织”来干涉拉丁美洲各国的内政，是屡见不鲜的。但是像这一回由美国总统亲自发动这架机器，却是从来没有的。这说明了古巴革命和尼加拉瓜、多米尼加两国人民反独裁斗争的风暴大大地震撼了美国统治集团，迫使美国总统不得不亲自出马了。
    从各方面的报道看来，美国对加勒比海地区的干涉活动是从三方面齐头并进。一是在政治上、经济上对古巴革命政权施加巨大压力，企图迫使古巴政府离开民族民主革命的道路。二是利用“美洲国家组织”来把“制造加勒比海地区动荡局势”的“罪名”加在古巴身上，以便在对古巴进行武装干涉时“师出有名”。三是积极筹建“美洲国家组织”的“警察部队”，既作为武装侵略古巴的主力，也用来帮助尼加拉瓜、多米尼加两国独裁政权镇压人民的反独裁武装起义；同时又积极武装古巴反革命分子和唆使多米尼加独裁政权组织所谓“外国义勇军”，作为侵略古巴的辅助部队。
    美国这些无耻的、露骨的干涉活动，激起了拉丁美洲人民的巨大愤怒，一场壮阔的反干涉斗争正在拉丁美洲普遍展开。以卡斯特罗为首的古巴革命政府在古巴人民的一致支持下，以继续严厉镇压反革命分子和坚决执行土地改革，回答了美帝国主义的无耻干涉。卡斯特罗总理严厉斥责了美国的召开美洲国家外长会议来干涉古巴内政的伎俩，并且宣布古巴人民将坚决保卫祖国。美国企图通过“美洲国家组织”干涉古巴和其他国家的阴谋，并不能瞒过拉丁美洲人民。拉丁美洲各国的舆论异口同声地指出，“美洲国家组织”对加勒比海地区的任何干涉都是美国的干涉。在许多拉丁美洲国家，不仅是广大人民纷纷抗议美国的干涉活动，而且有不少官方人士也表示反对利用“美洲国家组织”来干涉美洲国家的内政。
    这场干涉与反干涉的斗争正在继续发展中。一切迹象表明美国并不会在巨大的反干涉运动面前收起它的干涉活动。当然，这只能促使拉丁美洲各国人民更加团结起来，向美帝国主义进行更加坚决的斗争。
