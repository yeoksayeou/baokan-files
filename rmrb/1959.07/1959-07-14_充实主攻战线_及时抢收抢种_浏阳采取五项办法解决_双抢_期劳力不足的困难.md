    Enrich the Main Attack Front, Seize the Time to Harvest and Plant
    Liuyang Adopts Five Measures to Solve the Difficulty of Insufficient Labor During the "Double搶" Period

    (Our Dispatch) The People's Communes in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, have generally formulated labor plans for the period of rushing to harvest early rice and rushing to plant late rice. By rationally arranging labor, promoting the use of new farm tools, rationally arranging farm work, and organizing forces to provide support, they have solved the difficulty of insufficient labor during this year's "Double搶" period.

    Liuyang County planted 650,000 mu of early rice this year, which is expected to increase production significantly compared to last year. Therefore, the efforts in harvesting, threshing, transporting, drying, and storing have significantly increased. The county has also increased the planting of late rice compared to last year. In order to ensure that early rice is brought into the granary and late rice and other late autumn crops are planted in a timely manner, the entire county is prepared to fully complete the "Double搶" task within ten to twelve days. This makes farm work more concentrated than ever, and labor is very tight. According to statistics from 17 communes in the county, a total of 6.5 million labor days are needed during the "Double搶" period, but according to the original number of agricultural workers, only 4.26 million labor days can be done, a shortage of 2.24 million labor days. Based on these circumstances, party organizations at all levels explained the "Double搶" task for this year to the masses, summarized typical examples and experiences of timely harvesting and planting last year to achieve a bumper harvest, and made everyone understand the importance of doing a good job in "Double搶" this year. On this basis, the masses were further mobilized, and successful experiences in labor arrangement and use last year were summarized. Based on different situations, the following measures were adopted to solve the problem of tight labor during the "Double搶".

    First, all communes and brigades in the county comprehensively and rationally arrange labor according to the strength of the existing agricultural labor force, technical expertise, and different farm work during the "Double搶" period to strengthen the main attack front of "Double搶". Strong men and women were organized into professional organizations of "five groups and one department" (threshing rice, drying grain, transplanting rice seedlings, animal husbandry and economic crop cultivation, and miscellaneous work, etc., five groups and one logistics department). The elderly were arranged to look after cattle, take care of children, and deliver tea, and to drive chickens and ducks in the field. Weaker women cooked meals, washed clothes, hoed vegetable plots, and chopped firewood. Fully tap potential and improve work efficiency.

    Second, industries and sideline occupations that can be temporarily stopped are stopped, and those that cannot be stopped should be appropriately reduced to squeeze out a portion of the labor force to invest in "Double搶". The county has currently extracted more than 42,000 people to participate in "Double搶", which can solve the deficit of more than 420,000 labor days.

    Third, several types of advanced tools that were used effectively last year were selected and promoted during the "Double搶" period. For example, the 65-type rapid rice harvesting machine, which can be mastered by one woman, is planned to be promoted to 12,000 units; the rapid rice harvesting machine is planned to be promoted to 5,200 units. In terms of transportation, the county plans to universally use carts and boats. More than 45,000 local carts and 86 small boats have now been repaired and manufactured, and more than 1,200 field avenues have been newly built and renovated, with a total length of more than 3,200 li. In addition, the communes are prepared to fully utilize local water power, animal power, and electricity. In this way, the county can save more than 745,000 labor days.

    Fourth, according to the different circumstances of various farm works, try to stagger them and take care of everything comprehensively. Before "Double搶", they carried out two cultivations, weeding, and topdressing for mid-season rice, miscellaneous grains, and economic crops in advance; the more than 123,000 mu of autumn sweet potatoes, autumn corn, autumn buckwheat and other miscellaneous grains that were originally planned to be planted in the county are prepared to be pushed back to after "Double搶". In the labor arrangement for rushing to harvest, the method of "three firsts and three lasts" is also adopted according to the maturity of the rice: first harvest the lodged and early maturing fields, then harvest the general fields; first harvest the fields in front of and behind the houses, then harvest the fields in remote areas; first harvest the earlier maturing "red-footed early", then harvest the later maturing "Southern Special", staggering the farm work in a planned way.

    Fifth, organize forces from all sides to support "Double搶". One is to organize cadres of organs, workers and staff of industrial and mining enterprises, and residents of market towns to support "Double搶". The county has now organized 105 support brigades, with more than 102,000 people, who have departed one after another since the 7th of this month. The other is that communes and brigades support each other according to the principle of equal value exchange. There are nine communes and fifty-five brigades in the county that are mountain communes and teams with more mid-season rice, single-season late rice, and more dry land. The labor force is not particularly tight during the "Double搶" period, so they are organized to support outside communes and teams. Through the above two methods, the county can do more than 800,000 labor days.

    In order to ensure the victorious completion of the "Double搶" task, the county has also launched a red flag competition centered on "comparing progress, comparing workdays, and comparing quality". The county is divided into four competition zones, and all 17 communes and 331 brigades have made red flags, and they have all found competition objects and set competition conditions between communes, teams, and individuals. Recently, the county has gradually transferred more than 10,000 cadres to work groups to lead this work. (Huang Ye)

    充实主攻战线　及时抢收抢种
    浏阳采取五项办法解决“双抢”期劳力不足的困难
    本报讯　湖南省浏阳县各人民公社普遍制订了抢收早稻、抢插晚稻期间的劳动规划。通过合理安排劳力，推广使用新式农具，合理安排农活，组织力量支援等办法，解决了今年“双抢”时期劳力不足的困难。
    浏阳县今年插的六十五万亩早稻，预计将比去年大大增产，因此，收、打、运、晒、藏等工夫显著增加。这个县栽插晚稻也比去年增加。为了使早稻颗粒归仓，及时播种晚稻和其他晚秋作物，全县准备在十天到十二天内全面完成“双抢”任务。这样一来，农活比任何时候都集中，劳力十分紧张。据全县十七个公社统计，“双抢”期间共需要六百五十万个劳动日，但按原农业出工人数计算，只能做劳动日四百二十六万个，还差二百二十四万个劳动日。各级党组织根据这些情况，向群众交代了今年“双抢”任务，总结了去年及时收好播好获得丰收的典型事例和经验，使大家懂得今年搞好“双抢”的重要性。在这个基础上，进一步发动群众，总结了去年劳力安排和使用方面的成功经验，根据不同情况，采取以下一些办法来解决“双抢”劳力紧张问题。
    首先，全县各公社、大队根据现有农业劳动力的强弱情况，技术特长，和“双抢”期间不同的农活，全面合理安排劳力，加强“双抢”主攻战线。把身强力壮的男女劳力组成了“五组一部”（打禾、晒谷、插秧、畜牧和经济作物培植、杂工等五组和一个后勤部）的专业组织。安排老年人看牛，带小孩，送茶水，到禾场赶鸡鸭。身体较弱的妇女煮茶饭，洗衣服，锄菜土，砍柴火。充分发挥潜力，提高工作效率。
    其次，把可以暂时停下来的工业、副业停下来，不能停的要适当紧缩，挤出一部分劳力投入“双抢”。全县目前已抽出四万二千多人参加“双抢”，可以解决四十二万多个劳动日的赤字。
    第三，从去年使用过的效果较好的先进工具中挑选了若干种，在“双抢”期间推广。例如一个妇女可掌握的六十五型快速割禾器，准备推广一万二千部；快速割禾器准备推广五千二百部。在运输上，全县准备普遍使用车子和船运。现在已经修理、制造了四万五千多张土车和八十六只小船，新修和改修了一千二百多条田间大道，共长三千二百多华里。此外，各公社准备充分利用本地的水力、畜力、电力。这样全县可以节省七十四万五千多个劳动日。
    第四，根据各项农活的不同情况，设法错开，全面照顾。他们在“双抢”以前，对中稻、杂粮、经济作物，提早进行了两次中耕、锄草、追肥；原来计划全县插的十二万三千多亩秋红薯、秋玉米、秋荞等杂粮，准备推到“双抢”后再插。在抢收的劳力安排上，也根据稻子的成熟程度，采取“三先三后”的办法：先收倒伏了的、成熟早的田，后收一般田；先收屋前屋后的，后收边远地区的田；先收成熟较早的“红脚早”，后收成熟较迟的“南特号”，把农活有计划的错开。
    第五，组织各方面力量支援“双抢”。一是组织机关干部、工矿企业职工、集镇居民支援“双抢”。现在全县已经组织了一百零五个支援大队，有十万二千多人，从本月7日起已先后出发。一是公社与公社，大队与大队之间按照等价交换的原则，互相支援。全县有九个公社五十五个大队是中稻、一季晚稻、旱土多的山区社和队，劳力在“双抢”期间并不特别紧张，于是组织他们支援外社外队。通过以上两个办法，全县可以做八十多万个劳动日。
    为了保证“双抢”任务的胜利完成，全县还开展了以“比进度，比工日，比质量”等为中心的流动红旗竞赛。全县划了四个竞赛区，十七个公社三百三十一个大队都做了流动红旗，社、队、个人之间都找了竞赛对象，订了竞赛条件。最近全县逐级下放了一万多名干部到作业组领导这项工作。（黄叶）
