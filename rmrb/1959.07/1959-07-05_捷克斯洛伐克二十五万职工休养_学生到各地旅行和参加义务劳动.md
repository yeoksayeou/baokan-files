    Prague Dispatch: Midsummer has arrived in Czechoslovakia, and scenic sanatorium areas throughout the country are busy receiving tens of thousands of workers, farmers, office staff, and their families who are coming for vacation.

    Organizing the annual vacation for the working people is one of the important tasks of the Czechoslovak trade unions. The trade union sanatoriums are located in scenic areas all over the country. This year, the trade union sanatoriums will receive 250,000 workers from factories and enterprises across the country, who only need to pay 25% of the actual cost during their vacation.

    Factories and enterprises also organize collective vacations for young workers, arranging rich and colorful collective activities for them, so that they can not only get good rest during the holidays, but also gain a lot of new knowledge about the history, geography, and natural science of their motherland.

    While the working people are on vacation, students from major, middle, and primary schools have also started their happy summer vacation. This year, the Czechoslovak National Travel Agency is cooperating with schools to organize 800,000 primary and middle school students to travel to various places, and many children have participated in summer camp activities. Many older middle school students, especially college students, will participate in traditional and meaningful voluntary labor during the summer vacation. They will go to the countryside to help with summer planting and harvesting, participate in the East Slovakian land improvement work in full swing, assist cooperatives in building cowsheds and pigsties, and go to factories and mines to help with production.

    组织好劳动人民一年一度的休假是捷克斯洛伐克工会重要的任务之一。工会的休养所几乎遍布全国各地的风景区，今年工会休养所将接待二十五万从全国各地工厂企业来的工人，他们在休假期间只需付实际费用的25％。
    各工厂企业也组织青年工人集体休假，为他们安排丰富多采的集体活动，使他们在假日中不仅得到很好的休息，而且能获得许多有关祖国历史、地理和自然科学的新知识。
    当劳动人民正在休假时，各大、中、小学校的学生们也开始了愉快的暑假生活。今年捷克斯洛伐克国家旅行社和学校合作，组织了八十万中小学生到各地旅行，还有不少儿童参加了夏令营的活动。而许多年龄较大的中学生，特别是大学生在暑假期间将参加传统的、有意义的义务劳动，他们去到农村帮助夏种夏收，参加东斯洛伐克火热朝天的土壤改良工作，协助合作社建筑牛舍猪圈，以及前往工厂和矿山去帮助生产。
