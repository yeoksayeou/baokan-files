    Why Does Cotton Shrink?
    It's truly a headache when new fabric is made into clothing without being washed first, and it often ends up being too short or too tight. Why does cotton shrink? Because cotton is woven from warp and weft yarns, and when it's soaked in water, the yarns become much thicker than when they are dry, and their length shortens accordingly. This means cotton will shrink to varying degrees, which is the reason cotton shrinks. However, different cotton fabrics have different structures, and the degree of shrinkage also varies. Fabrics like plain cloth generally shrink about 3% in both length and width, while linen-like fabrics shrink 5% in width. Khaki fabrics shrink less in width, only about 1%, but shrink more than 6% in length.
    It is impossible to ask for cotton to not shrink at all, but there are ways to make it shrink less. Last year, workers at the Shanghai Second Printing and Dyeing Factory created a pre-shrinking machine. Cotton fabric treated with this machine shrinks only about 1%. Soon, people will be able to buy khaki and poplin that has been pre-shrunk.

    棉布为什么会缩水？
    新布买来，不下水就做衣服，常常不是短了，就是瘦了，确实是件很头痛的事。为什么棉布会缩水呢？因为棉布是用经纱和纬纱交织成的，当它在水里浸透后，纱线比干燥时要粗得多，长度也就相应地缩短，棉布就会有不同程度的收缩，这就是棉布缩水的原因。然而，各种棉布的组织不一样，缩水的程度也不同。像平布一类的织物，长短和宽窄缩水一般在3％左右，麻纱等织物横缩5％，卡其一类织物横缩比较少，只有1％，但是长短缩水要缩6％以上。
    要求棉布绝对不缩水是不可能的，但也不是没有办法使它少缩水，去年上海第二印染厂职工创制了一种预缩整理机，织好棉布经过这台机器的处理，只缩水1％左右，不久，人们就可以买到这种经过预缩处理的卡其和府绸了。
