A Stroll Through Beijing's Antique Bookstores
By our reporter Bai Sheng

Beijing has many antique bookstores, adding a unique touch to its rich cultural life.

If you are interested...

If you are interested, you can start from the "Laixun Ge" and "Suiya Zhai" antique bookstores in Liulichang in the southern part of the city..., all the way to the "Xiugeng Tang" antique bookstore in Longfusi in the eastern part of the city, and then to the antique bookstores in the Xidan Shopping Center and the Dong'an Market. Even if you just take a quick glance, you will be amazed by the number of books and the richness of their content! If you are a bookworm, you can simply take the time every day to admire the various ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign versions of antique books that you love. If you only like ancient Chinese books, you will also find all kinds of precious rare editions and manuscripts that you need and love. Even Song and Yuan dynasty woodblock printed ancient books, which are now rarely seen, can be found there. As for ancient books from the Ming and Qing dynasties, there are many collections there, especially the Qing dynasty books, which are simply too numerous to see. Laixun Ge in Liulichang alone has a large collection of ancient books. The thirty-two storage rooms of this antique bookstore, which has been open for more than a hundred years, are filled with books. Walking into Laixun Ge, you will feel as if you have entered a vast forest of books. All kinds of thread-bound ancient books are stacked from the ground all the way to the roof. Whether it is classics, history, philosophy, or literature, nothing is missing. Among them, many classical novels from the Ming and Qing dynasties are especially attractive to readers. Perhaps you don't want to buy any books, but when you see those ancient books that are relatively cheap, antique-style, and exquisitely printed, you may buy one casually. In the old book markets of Dong'an Market and Xidan Shopping Center, you can freely browse and select various old books and magazines that cannot be seen or bought in new bookstores, as well as some old books of new literature and expired magazines that were published not long ago. There are books and magazines from the May Fourth era, as well as various books and magazines from before and after liberation.

Those who come to the bookstores include not only experts and scholars seeking precious ancient books, but also readers who like to go to old bookstores and browse through them when they have time, as well as young students who love literature and theoretical books. In addition, there is also a group of academic research institutions, universities, and libraries that send people here to select ancient books in batches.

        The Spring of Antique Bookstores

According to historical records, Beijing's antique bookstores have a long history. As early as the Hongzhi period of the Ming Dynasty, there were book workshops in Beijing, mostly located in the Zhengyangmen area of Qianmen, such as "Jintai Yue Family Book Workshop" and "Jintai Wang Liang Book Workshop" outside Zhengyangmen. In the early Qing Dynasty, they were mostly concentrated in the Ciren Temple (today's Baoguo Temple) area inside Guang'anmen, and in the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, they were mostly concentrated in Liulichang outside Hepingmen and Longfusi in Dongsi. During the Qianlong era, when the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries was revised, Beijing's antique bookstores had developed to more than thirty. Later, there were more than one hundred at most. During the Kuomintang rule, antique bookstores gradually declined.

After the liberation of Beijing, under the leadership and attention of the Party and the People's Government, antique bookstores ushered in a new period of prosperity. In order to strengthen the leadership and management of antique bookstores, in 1952, Beijing established the first state-owned antique bookstore—China Bookstore. After all of Beijing's antique bookstores became jointly owned public-private partnerships last spring, they became some of the antique book outlets of China Bookstore. However, some long-established bookstores such as Laixun Ge, Suiya Zhai, and Xiugeng Tang... still retain their original names. In order to better meet the needs of academic research institutions, experts, scholars, and the general public, China Bookstore has also specially opened a classical bookstore.

Since antique bookstores have been under the leadership and management of the state-owned China Bookstore, the antique book industry has been greatly developed and is much more active than in the past. In the past, private antique bookstores not only had a small collection of books and a small amount of purchases, but also had a small supply range, and the prices of books were chaotic. The price difference for the same book in different stores could be very large, but after the joint venture, the situation completely changed. Now, Beijing's antique bookstores have established regular contact with many academic research institutions, universities, libraries, as well as some experts and scholars across the country. They promptly provide the precious materials purchased from the public to the most needed units, so that these ancient books and periodicals can play a greater role.

Finding Books for People, Finding People for Books

Beijing's antique bookstores have indeed played a great role in exploring the cultural heritage of the motherland, protecting revolutionary cultural relics, supplying historical and cultural materials, and providing scientific research materials. According to the principle of "making the past serve the present," they put forward the slogan of finding books for readers and finding readers for books, and organized experienced antique book practitioners to conduct antique book purchases across the country, collecting a large number of rich ancient books and revolutionary historical materials scattered among the people. In the past one or two years alone, the Beijing China Bookstore has collected and discovered millions of copies of various versions of ancient books and revolutionary historical materials. Before liberation, however, the fate of many more valuable ancient books was to be sent to paper mills to be made into "recycled paper," and some may have been used as sugar wrappers or raw materials for firecracker workshops.

Recently, the Beijing China Bookstore discovered a very precious Song edition of "Chu Ci" among the people in Beijing. Although this book has been around for more than 700 years, it is still intact, except for some traces of termites on the pages. There are very few of this Song edition of "Chu Ci" that have survived to this day. Only the Beijing Library has a copy, but it is not exactly the same as the newly discovered version. Therefore, its discovery is very important for the study of the book "Chu Ci." In addition, the Xidan Shopping Center Old Bookstore of China Bookstore recently discovered a 120-chapter handwritten copy of "Dream of the Red Chamber" among the people in Beijing, which has been sent to the Institute of Literature of the Chinese Academy of Sciences for collection. The discovery of this century-old handwritten copy of "Dream of the Red Chamber" has provided very important materials for the academic community to study the book "Dream of the Red Chamber." Recently, China Bookstore discovered a handwritten copy of "Liaozhai Wai Shu" among the people in Shandong. This copy contains four articles that have never been seen before: "Smoking Ghost's Admonition," "A Riot of the Disabled," "The Story of the East Wall," and "The Story of Plants and Trees."

In terms of ancient books, the rare and fine books purchased by China Bookstore this year also include one or two thousand kinds, including the Song editions of "Annotations and Explanations of the Spring and Autumn Classics," "Mr. Shantang's Examination of Chapters and Palaces," the Qing edition of "Li Cheng" County Chronicles, the Qing Qianlong movable type edition of the 120-chapter "Dream of the Red Chamber" (Cheng Yiben), and so on.

In terms of precious revolutionary historical materials, this year's discoveries include the inaugural issue of the "Red Woman" magazine published in 1927, which is a very rare documentary material on the women's movement. Another example is the discovery of the sixth issue of the "Sprout" (then renamed "New Land"), the organ of the Chinese Left-Wing Writers' League in 1930, and the discovery of Chairman Mao's early revolutionary essays "The Hunan Autonomy Movement Should Be Launched" and "The Fundamental Problem of Hunan Construction—The Republic of Hunan." In addition, many early publications of the Party with disguised covers were discovered.

      Several People Read One Book

The staff of the antique book outlets of China Bookstore also actively publicize to readers the significance and benefits of old book recycling and re-distribution, so that readers can sell the books and periodicals that they have read and no longer need to the bookstore as much as possible, and then the bookstore can sell them to new users. In this way, many books and periodicals, especially literary and theoretical books, are repeatedly circulated, so that more readers can read them, which not only saves the country paper and printing power, but also overcomes the waste phenomenon of certain books being reprinted on the one hand and flowing into paper mills on the other. From the perspective of serving readers, the recycling and redistribution of old books not only provides readers with some cheap old books that cannot be bought in Xinhua bookstores, but also brings some benefits to readers who handle existing books.

In order to meet the needs of readers and better serve readers, the antique book outlets of Beijing China Bookstore have also thoroughly cleaned up all the long-term backlog of incomplete antique books, repaired many relatively precious antique books that were old and worm-eaten, or damaged after being damp, and copied and completed many incomplete ancient books and periodicals. Last year alone, China Bookstore repaired more than 5,000 copies of precious incomplete books. In addition, copying and reproduction work was carried out to restore the lives of incomplete ancient books.

In terms of reorganizing the classification of collections, Beijing's antique bookstores have also done a lot of work. As long as you go to the Dong'an Market Antique Bookstore, you will find how much Beijing's antique bookstores have changed in the past year. Now all the antique bookstores in the market are concentrated on that street of Guiming Shopping Center and a nearby alley. When you stroll through the book forest, you can see that the books in each place are arranged so neatly, all the ancient books are inserted with labels of book titles and prices, and many old magazines are put together into sets and re-bound. They completely and scientifically classify and store all the ancient books and periodicals as much as possible to facilitate readers' browsing. In the past, the chaotic phenomenon in private antique bookstores where ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign books were placed on the same shelf, and books from before and after liberation were mixed together has now been greatly improved.

Now, as long as you go to any antique bookstore opened by China Bookstore, you will feel very satisfied. From young to old staff, they will enthusiastically introduce you to the types of their collections and quickly help you find the ancient books and periodicals you urgently need. When you leave the bookstore, the shelves of ancient books exude the fragrance of knowledge. Antique bookstores, like new bookstores, have great appeal. People who have been to antique bookstores will often come to this world. (Attached picture)

    北京古旧书店漫步
    本报记者　柏生
    北京的古旧书店很多。它为北京丰富的文化生活，增添了异彩。
    如果你有兴致的话……
    如果你有兴致的话，你可以从南城的琉璃厂古书店“来熏阁”、“邃雅斋”……，直到东城的隆福寺古书店“修绠堂”，再到西单商场的一片旧书店和东安市场的一片旧书店转上一大圈，即使是走马看花，你也会发现那里藏书之多，内容种类之丰富，真会令你惊奇！如果你是一个书癖，那你简直可以天天抽暇到那里去欣赏你爱好的古今中外各种版本的古旧书了。如果你只喜欢中国古书，那你也会找到你所需要和喜爱的各种珍贵的善本、抄本。就是现今已经很少见了的宋、元版本木刻古书，你在那里也可以翻到。至于明清两代的古籍版本，那里收藏的很多，尤其是清代的古书种类之多，真是看也看不过来。仅琉璃厂来熏阁收藏的古书就很多。这家开设已有一百多年的古书店的三十二间藏书室中，就摆满了整房整房的书。走进来熏阁，真使你感到仿佛进入浩瀚的书林，各种线装古书从地上一直摆得高到屋顶。无论是经、史、子、集，都无所不有，其中明清两代的许多古典小说更是十分吸引读者。也许你并不想买一本什么书，可是当你看到那些标价比较便宜、装订得古色古香、印刷质量又极其精致的古书，你也许会随手买下一本。在东安市场和西单商场的旧书市场里，你更可以任意浏览和挑选在新书店里看不到和买不到的各种旧书刊杂志，以及才出版不久的一些新文艺之类的旧书和过期杂志。这里有五四时代的书刊杂志，也有解放前后的各种书刊杂志。
    来到书店的人，不仅有寻求珍贵古籍的专家、学者，也有经常有暇就喜欢到旧书店里去走走、随便翻阅翻阅的读者，也有爱好文艺和理论书籍的青年学生。另外，还有一批学术研究机关、高等学校和图书馆派到这里来整批整批地选购古旧书籍的人。
        古书店的春天
    根据文献记载，北京的古旧书店，已经有悠久的历史了。从明朝弘治年间，北京就有书坊，那时多开设在前门的正阳门一带，像正阳门外的“金台岳家书坊”“金台汪谅书坊”等。到清朝初年多集中在广安门内的慈仁寺（今天的报国寺）一带，到乾隆嘉庆年间，多集中在和平门外的琉璃厂和东四隆福寺一带。乾隆时代重修四库全书时，北京的古旧书店已发展到有三十多家。以后最多时曾到过一百多家。国民党统治时期，古旧书店便日趋衰落了。
    北京解放后，古旧书店在党和人民政府的领导和重视下，又出现了新的兴盛时期。为了加强对古旧书店的领导和管理，在1952年北京成立了第一个国营古旧书店——中国书店。去年春天北京的古旧书店全部公私合营后，就都分别成为中国书店的一些古旧书门市部了，但有些历史悠久的书店像来熏阁、邃雅斋、修绠堂……至今仍保留了他们原来的字号。中国书店为了更好地满足学术研究机关、专家学者和广大读者的需要，还特别开设了古典门市部。
    自从古旧书店统由国营中国书店领导管理以后，古旧书业得到了更大的发展，比过去活跃多了。过去，私营古旧书店不仅藏书量少，采购量少，供应的范围也小，而且书的售价混乱，同一部书在不同店里差价可以很大，但合营以后，情况完全改变了。现在北京的古旧书店和全国许多学术研究机关、高等学校、图书馆，以及一些专家、学者都建立了经常的联系。他们把在民间采购到的珍贵资料，都及时供给最需要的单位，使这些古旧书刊发挥了更大的作用。
    为人找书　为书找人
    北京的古旧书店，在发掘祖国文化遗产，保护革命文物和供应文史资料，提供科学研究资料方面，的确起了很大的作用。它们根据“古为今用”的方针，提出为读者找书，为书找读者的口号，组织富有经验的古旧书从业人员到全国各地进行古旧书籍的采购工作，把流散在民间的丰富的古籍和革命史料大批地搜集回来。近一、二年仅北京中国书店搜集和发现的各种版本古籍和革命史料就有几百万册。而在解放前，许多比这还宝贵的古旧书的命运，却大量地被送进造纸厂做了“还魂纸”，有的也许做了什么包糖纸或是爆竹坊的卷纸原料。
    最近，北京中国书店在北京民间发现了一部十分珍贵的宋版“楚辞”。这部书虽然经过七百多年，但至今仍保存完整无缺，只是书页中有白蚁咬过的一些残痕。这部宋版“楚辞”流传到今天的已经很少见了，只有北京图书馆收藏了一部，但和新发现的这部版本还不完全一样。因此它的发现，对研究楚辞一书十分重要。另外，中国书店西单商场旧书店最近在北京民间还发现了一部百二十回手抄本的“红楼梦”，已送到中国科学院文学研究所收藏。这一经历百年的手抄本“红楼梦”的发现，对学术界研究“红楼梦”一书又提供了很重要的材料。最近，中国书店在山东民间又发现了一部手抄本“聊斋外书”，这部抄本里，有过去从未见过的“烟鬼戒”、“群残瞎闹传”、“东墙记”和“草木传”四篇。
    在古书方面，今年中国书店采购的罕见的珍善本书还有一两千种，其中有宋刻本的“春秋经传集解”、“山堂先生章宫讲考索”、清刻本的“历乘”县志、清乾隆活字本百二十回“红楼梦”（程乙本）等。
    在珍贵革命史料方面今年发现的，有1927年出版的“赤女”杂志创刊号，这是极少见的一本有关妇女运动的文献资料。又如1930年中国左翼作家联盟的机关刊物“萌芽”第六期（当时改名为“新地”）的发现，毛主席早期的革命论文“湖南自治运动应该发起了”、“湖南建设问题的根本问题——湖南共和国”的发现。此外，还发现了许多封面化名的党的早期出版物。
      一本书几个人看
    中国书店各古旧书门市部的店员，还主动地向读者宣传旧书回收和再发行的意义和好处，使读者把自己已经读过不再需要的书刊尽量卖给书店，然后书店再售给新的需要者。这样，有许多书刊，特别是文艺书和理论书，经过重复流通，使更多的读者得到阅读，不但为国家节约了纸张和印刷力量，同时也克服某些书籍一方面再版印刷，一方面流入造纸厂的浪费现象。从为读者服务的角度看，旧书的回收和再发行，不但向读者供应了某些在新华书店买不到的廉价旧书，同时也为处理存书的读者带来了一些好处。
    北京中国书店各古旧书门市部，为了满足读者需要，更好地为读者服务，还把长年积压的全部残缺古旧书进行了彻底的清理，把其中年久虫蛀，或受潮后残破的许多比较珍贵的古旧书做了修补，把许多不全的古籍和期刊抄配全了。仅去年一年，中国书店就修补了珍贵的残书五千多册。此外还进行了抄配复制工作，使残缺不全的古旧书都恢复了生命。
    在整顿藏书分类方面，北京的古旧书店也做了不少工作。你只要到东安市场古旧书店转一下，就会发现这一年来北京古旧书店的变化是多么大。现在市场里所有的古旧书店都集中到桂铭商场的那一条街上和附近的一条夹道上来了。当你漫步书林而过时，可以看到每一处的书籍都是陈设得那么整齐，所有的古书上都一一插上了书名和价格的标签，许多旧杂志都配成了套，重新装订起来。它们把所有的古旧书刊完全科学化的分门别类存放起来，尽量便利读者的浏览。过去私营古旧书店中放书时古今中外共居一架，解放前后交错并陈的混乱现象现在已经改进多了。
    现在只要你走到中国书店开设的无论哪一处古旧书店，都会使你感到非常满意。从年青的到年老的店员，他们都会热情地为你介绍着它们藏书的种类，迅速地帮助你找到你迫切需要的古旧书刊。当你离开书店的时候，那满架的古书，散发着知识的芬芳。古旧书店也像新书店一样，有很大的吸引力，到过古书店的人，就会经常走到这个天地来。（附图片）
