    Obtaining "Scripture" Locally

    Whenever "obtaining scripture" is mentioned, people think of faraway places. Chinese novelists have even used this as a theme to write a novel called "Journey to the West." However, the workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's Second Engineering Company have obtained "scripture" from the creative practices of the company's own employees. This "scripture" has not only promoted current production but also driven the scientific research of the entire company, so it can be called true scripture. Their method of obtaining scripture is to implement the "three-in-one combination" under the leadership of the Party, mobilize the masses to summarize experience, and learn and promote advanced experience. This proves once again the truth that as long as we sincerely respect the creativity of the masses and are determined to come from the masses and go to the masses, we will surely be able to obtain "scripture."

    就地取“经”
    一谈到取“经”，人们就要想到老远老远的地方。中国的小说家还以这个为题材，写了一本小说，叫“西游记”。武钢第二工程公司职工就在本公司职工创造性的实践活动中取到了“经”。这个“经”既推动了当前的生产，又带动整个公司的科学研究，所以称得起是真经。他们取经的方法，就是在党的领导下实行三结合，发动群众总结经验，学习、推广先进经验。这又一次证明了一个真理：只要诚心诚意地尊重群众的创造，下定决心从群众中来，到群众中去，那就一定能够取到“经”。
