    Establishing Models to Improve Efficiency in "Double抢" (Harvesting and Planting)
    Party Members and Cadres of Liubin Commune in Sichuan Take the Lead in Creating High-Efficiency Records
    Chengdu, July 26 (reported by this newspaper) — Liubin Commune in Nanxi County, Sichuan, has established high-efficiency models and launched a high-efficiency campaign, accelerating the progress of "Double抢" (harvesting early rice and planting late rice).
    This year, the early rice in Liubin Commune was planted well and grew densely, requiring significantly more labor for harvesting than in previous years. According to the commune's Party General Branch, based on the available labor force and work efficiency after the start of "Double抢," it would take one and a half months to complete the harvesting and planting, nearly doubling the planned time. After repeated studies, it was decided to immediately launch a high-efficiency campaign centered on improving operational techniques and tools.
    In carrying out the high-efficiency campaign, all party members and cadres took the lead in setting up models. The Party General Branch Secretary, Fu Huaiqing, personally led three high-efficiency combat groups in a competition on the first day of the campaign. The threshing record created by the Tu Dexiang combat group on the first day exceeded the average of ordinary commune members by more than seven times. Subsequently, high-efficiency achievements created by party members, Youth League members, and activists in plowing, transplanting rice seedlings, and preparing seedlings also emerged. For example, the Xu Mingqing combat group improved transplanting techniques, with five people transplanting more than twenty mu (a Chinese unit of measurement, 1 mu ≈ 0.16 acres) in one day, more than double the amount of ordinary commune members. Under the call of the General Branch, commune members actively signed up to participate in high-efficiency combat groups, launching a surge in learning from and emulating the models. Within two days, fifty-five high-efficiency threshing groups emerged, with the highest exceeding the general work efficiency by more than ten times. In these combat groups, more than 80% were Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists. The commune's management districts and production teams promptly organized evaluations, held on-site meetings to spread advanced experiences, and commended and rewarded these models, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the masses.
    Due to the launch of the high-efficiency campaign, the overall work efficiency of the commune has greatly improved. At the beginning of "Double抢," the average daily threshing efficiency per worker was only a little over six fen (a Chinese unit of measurement) and the plowing rate was one mu to two mu per person and ox per day, while the transplanting rate was two mu to three mu per person. Now, the overall work efficiency of the commune has generally increased by 20-30%.
    With the improvement of work efficiency, the early rice in the commune has basically been harvested, and the late rice can be transplanted before the end of the month.

### 树立标兵　提高双抢工效  四川留宾公社党团员带头创造高工效纪录

    树立标兵　提高双抢工效
    四川留宾公社党团员带头创造高工效纪录
    本报成都26日电　四川南溪县留宾公社树立高工效标兵，开展高工效运动，加快了“双抢”进度。
    留宾公社今年的早稻种得好，长得密，需要抢收的劳力比往年大大增加。公社党总支根据现有劳力和“双抢”开始后的工效计算，抢收抢栽要一个半月才能完成，比计划日期增多近一倍。经过反复研究，决定立即开展一个改进操作技术、改进工具为中心的高工效运动。
    在开展高工效运动中，全社党员和干部积极带头，树立标兵。党总支书记傅怀清在运动第一天就亲自带领三个高工效战斗小组展开竞赛。涂德祥战斗小组第一天创造的打谷纪录，就超过一般社员七倍以上（平均数字）。接着，在犁田、栽秧、扮秧等方面由党员、团员和积极分子创造的高工效也相继出现。如徐明清战斗组提高栽秧技术，五个人一天栽二十多亩，超过一般社员一倍多。在总支号召下，社员们纷纷报名参加高工效战斗组，展开了向标兵们学习和看齐的热潮，两天就出现了五十五个打谷高工效组，最高的超过一般工效十倍以上。在这些战斗组中，80％以上是共产党员、共青团员和积极分子。公社各管理区和生产队都及时组织评比，召开现场会传播先进经验，表扬和奖励了这些标兵，大大鼓舞了群众热情。
    由于高工效运动的开展，全社工效大大提高。“双抢”开始时每天打谷工效每个劳力平均只有六分多，犁田一人一牛每天一亩多到二亩，栽秧每人二亩多到三亩。现在全社工效普遍提高了20—30％。
    随着工效提高，全社早稻已基本收完，晚稻可以在月底前栽完。
