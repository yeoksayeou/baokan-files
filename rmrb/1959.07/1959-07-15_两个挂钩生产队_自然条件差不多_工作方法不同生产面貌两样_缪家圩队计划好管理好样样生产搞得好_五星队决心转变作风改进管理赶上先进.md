According to Zhejiang Daily news: The Miao Jiawei Production Team of Dongzha Commune and the Five-Star Production Team of Caozhuang Commune in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, after hooking up with each other to carry out a competition, although the two teams have roughly the same production conditions such as land and labor, due to the different work methods and efforts of the two teams, the production progress and production results are also very different. The Miao Jiawei Production Team is far ahead, and the Five-Star Production Team has fallen behind.

The Miao Jiawei Production Team finished transplanting single-season late rice on June 21, and the first weeding has been completed on more than 60%; soybean, sweet potato, and other dryland crops have all been weeded; the team members have also used their spare time in the early morning and evening to cultivate 319 mu of scattered wasteland, most of which have been planted with vegetables and small grains, and the double-cropping early rice is also growing very well, with more than 80% of the rice seedlings already heading and flowering. From June 23, the entire team also dispatched 42 laborers and 42 head of cattle to support the Tanghui Commune.

The Five-Star Production Team did not finish transplanting single-season late rice until the 26th, weeding has not yet begun, soybean, sweet potato, and other dryland crops have not been weeded, and more than 100 mu of land have not been planted. Most of the team's 1,513 mu of double-cropping early rice has not headed, and 250 mu are still "weed-infested fields."

The Miao Jiawei Production Team and the Five-Star Production Team have roughly the same labor and land conditions. Why are the production progress and production results so different? The main reasons are as follows:

(1) Different production management. Each small team of the Miao Jiawei Production Team has a relatively strict labor management system, and all kinds of agricultural work have quotas (labor quota and production quota). For example, rice transplanting is based on tasks assigned to individuals, with fixed quality and time; weeding is divided into groups by area, contracted to the end until harvest. If members continue to participate in collective production after completing the prescribed production quota, they are rewarded for the excess. In this way, all the members are happy and work actively. The Five-Star Production Team also has quotas, but they are just a formality. In rice transplanting, the task is simply assigned to individuals according to the labor base points, with no rewards for exceeding the quota and no penalties for failing to meet it. As for dryland production, there is not even a simple quota. Work evaluation and point calculation are also not timely. As a result, the members' enthusiasm for production is not high. Therefore, the labor efficiency of the two production teams is very different. For example, in single-season late rice transplanting, with the same specifications of 5x4, the Miao Jiawei Production Team can transplant an average of 1.2 mu per worker per day, while the Five-Star Production Team can only transplant an average of 0.8 mu per worker per day. The labor efficiency of the Miao Jiawei Team is 50% higher than that of the Five-Star Team.

(2) Different planning management. The Party branch of the Miao Jiawei Production Team attaches great importance to planning management. From the production team to the production small team and the operation group, there are plans for each season and arrangements for each stage, with prominent priorities, clear distinctions between primary and secondary tasks, and clear requirements. The Five-Star Production Team, on the other hand, from the production team to the production small team, has not done a good job in making plans and does things as they come. Therefore, the production of the Miao Jiawei Production Team can be interlocked, connected in every link, and take the lead step by step; while the Five-Star Production Team is disconnected from front to back and is passive step by step.

(3) Different working methods. The Miao Jiawei Production Team's leaders go deep into one point to set an example in everything, and then promote it comprehensively. Therefore, thinking is unified and action is fast. The Five-Star Production Team often makes general arrangements at meetings without going deep down to set an example. Therefore, the work appears rigid and stagnant, lacking vitality.

(4) Different political and ideological education work. Before mobilizing the masses to do each task, the Party branch of the Miao Jiawei Production Team fully conducts political and ideological education for the members and carries out extensive debates. For example, when proposing to grasp both the fields and the land with both hands, many cadres and members had the idea of "valuing the fields and slighting the land." The Party branch conducted education for the members by calculating accounts and making comparisons: last year, because the soybeans were not well managed, the average yield per mu was only 28 jin; this year, they were planted early and are growing very well, and each mu can yield 200 jin. The team's 1,000 mu of soybeans can yield 200,000 jin; plus the bean stalks, the income from soybeans alone can be 31,000 yuan, with an average of 80 yuan per household. After this calculation, the members proposed to ask for grain from the dryland and strive for a double harvest of fields and land, actively engaging in soybean weeding. The Five-Star Production Team, on the other hand, rarely conducts detailed ideological education for the members, and some ideological problems of the members have not been resolved, so many tasks are discounted.

Now the Five-Star Production Team has seen its shortcomings and is determined to improve management, strengthen political and ideological work, improve its work style, and catch up with the Miao Jiawei Production Team.

    两个挂钩生产队  自然条件差不多
    工作方法不同生产面貌两样
    缪家圩队计划好管理好样样生产搞得好
    五星队决心转变作风改进管理赶上先进
    据浙江日报消息　浙江省嘉兴县东栅公社缪家圩生产队和曹庄公社五星生产队，互相挂钩开展竞赛以后，尽管这两队土地、劳力等生产条件大体相同，但是，由于两队各自的工作方法不同，努力不同，生产进度、生产效果也大不相同，缪家圩生产队远远走在前面，五星生产队已经落在后头。
    缪家圩生产队6月21日就结束单季晚稻插秧，第一遍耘田已耘了60％多，毛豆、番薯等旱地作物都锄过草；社员们还利用早晚的空隙时间垦植零星荒地三百一十九亩，多数已种上蔬菜和小杂粮，连作早稻也生长得很好，80％以上的稻苗已抽穗扬花。从6月23日起，全队还抽出四十二个劳力、四十二头耕牛去支援塘汇公社。
    五星生产队到26日才结束单季晚稻插秧，耘田还没有开始，毛豆、番薯等旱地作物都没有锄过草，而且还有一百余亩地没有种上，全队一千五百一十三亩连作早稻多数没有抽穗，其中有二百五十亩还是“草荒田”。
    缪家圩生产队和五星生产队的劳力、土地条件大体相同，为什么生产进度和生产效果大不相同呢？主要有以下几个原因：
    （一）生产管理不同。缪家圩生产队的各个小队都有比较严密的劳动管理制度，样样农活有定额（劳动定额和生产定额）。如插秧是按人定任务，定质量，定时间；耘田是划片分组，一包到底，直到收割为止。社员在完成规定的生产定额以后，如果继续参加集体生产，超额部分给予奖励。这样做，社员个个欢欣鼓舞，干活积极。五星生产队虽然也有定额，但都流于形式。插秧中，只是按照劳动底分把任务摊到人，超过定额的也不奖，达不到的也不罚。至于旱地生产，连个简单的定额也没有。评工计分也很不及时。这样，社员的生产劲头就不高。因此，两个生产队的劳动效率就大不相同，如单季晚稻插秧，规格同样是5×4，缪家圩生产队平均每个劳动力每工能插一点二亩，五星生产队平均每个劳动力每工只能插零点八亩，缪家圩队的劳动效率比五星队高50％。
    （二）计划管理不同。缪家圩生产队党支部十分重视计划管理，从生产队到生产小队、操作组，季季有计划，段段有安排，并且重点突出，主次分明，要求明确。而五星生产队，从生产队到生产小队都没有很好地订计划，做到哪里算哪里。因此，缪家圩生产队的生产就能一环扣一环，环环相连，步步抢先；而五星生产队则前后脱节，步步被动。
    （三）工作方法不同。缪家圩生产队样样工作都是由领导干部深入一点，做出样子，然后全面推广，因此，思想统一，行动很快。而五星生产队经常是在会议上做一般的布置，没有深入下去做样子，因此，工作就显得死板呆滞，缺乏生气。
    （四）政治思想教育工作不同。缪家圩生产队党支部在发动群众做每一项工作以前，都充分地向社员进行政治思想教育，开展大鸣大放大辩论。如提出一手抓田、一手抓地的时候，不少干部和社员都有“重田轻地”思想。党支部就向社员进行算账对比教育：去年由于毛豆没有管理好，平均每亩地只收二十八斤；今年种得早，生长很好，每亩可以收到二百斤。全队一千亩毛豆，可以收二十万斤；再加上豆秆，从毛豆一项中就可以收入三万一千元，平均每户能分到八十元，这样算账以后，社员纷纷提出要向旱地要粮，争取田地双丰收，积极地投入毛豆除草工作。而五星生产队，由于很少对社员进行细致的思想教育，社员有些思想问题没有解决，许多工作就打了折扣。
    现在五星生产队已经看到了自己的缺点，决心改进管理，加强政治思想工作，改进工作作风，赶上缪家圩生产队。
