    Septuagenarian Can Lift a Hundred-Jin Barbell

    In a square in Moscow, a white-haired, robust old man walked to the barbell and performed three weightlifting movements – clean and jerk, snatch, and press – lifting the barbell each time.

    "Excuse me, how old are you?" a curious spectator asked.

    "Seventy-two."

    "It seems you must have been involved in weightlifting before?"

    "No, I'm just a weightlifting enthusiast. I made my barbell myself using flatcar wheels, and it weighs fifty-six kilograms."

    One unconvinced spectator stepped forward to try, but couldn't lift it at all, even though he was only thirty-five years old.

    "The key is exercise," the old man explained, playing with the barbell, "Ten years ago, I could lift an even heavier barbell, but now I can only lift this much. You ask where the strength comes from? I've loved sports since I was a child, and I've never smoked or drunk alcohol..."

    The old man, Nikolayev, used to teach art at a school in Moscow and is now retired. Although the old teacher is over seventy, his energy is still very strong. He can run one hundred meters in fifteen seconds.

### 年逾古稀的老人能举百斤重杠铃

    年逾古稀的老人能举百斤重杠铃
    在莫斯科的一个广场上，一个头发苍白、体格健壮的老人走到杠铃前面，作了三个举重动作——挺举、抓举、推举，每一次都把杠铃举了起来。
    “对不起，请问您多大年纪了？”观众好奇地问。
    “七十二。”
    “看来您从前一定从事过举重运动吧？”
      “没有，我只不过是举重爱好者。我的杠铃是自己用小平车轮子造的，五十六公斤重。”
    有一位观众不服气地上前试了一下，怎么也举不起来，尽管他才三十五岁。
    “问题在于锻炼。”老人一面玩弄杠铃，一面解释说，“十年前我举过更重的杠铃，现在我只能举这么重的。您问力气是从哪儿来的？我从小喜爱体育，没吸过烟，没喝过酒……”
    老人尼古拉耶夫从前在莫斯科一所学校教美术，现在已经退休了。尽管老教师已年过七十，他的精力仍然十分旺盛。他能在十五秒钟内跑一百公尺。
