The Zhupu Brigade dissects high-yield "sparrows"
Detailed and thorough measures for increasing late rice production
Make full use of new-style farm tools and transform old farm tools to solve the labor shortage; increase income and reduce expenditure to overcome production funding difficulties; store and conserve water to prevent drought; accumulate and manufacture refined fertilizer to eliminate backward fields; strengthen leadership in teams with weak work foundations to ensure balanced production increases.
    (Reported by our newspaper) Cadres and members of the Lianhua Commune Zhupu Brigade in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, jointly summarized their past high-yield late rice experiences and, with reference to this year's production conditions, specifically formulated the brigade's late rice production increase targets and measures, greatly boosting the confidence of the masses. A vigorous bumper harvest competition is rapidly unfolding.
    Analyzing High-Yield "Sparrows"
    At the beginning of the late rice bumper harvest campaign in the Zhupu Brigade, some people lacked confidence. In order to solve these people's ideological problems, boost confidence, and ensure the victorious launch of the late rice bumper harvest campaign, the team organized cadres and members to dissect high-yield "sparrows," specifically summarizing past experiences with fields yielding over 1,000 jin. They used local high-yield facts to educate the masses. A total of more than 600 cadres, elderly, middle-aged, and young farmers participated in this high-yield experience summary. They dissected more than 30 mu of late rice fields yielding over 1,000 jin, divided by different soil types and different plots of land. Taking clay soil fields as an example, in 1953, the late rice field of two mu and eight fen six which 社员曾分治耕作 (this seems to refer to a specific person who can't be found) cultivated, due to the selection of improved varieties, the implementation of six-by-seven-inch close planting, and the application of 100 dan of refined fertilizer per mu, as well as overcoming natural disasters such as pests and droughts, resulted in a yield of 1,118 jin of dry grain per mu. Taking semi-sandy soil fields as an example, last year, 13 mu of fields in "Hezaiyang" implemented reasonable close planting and applied more organic fertilizer, resulting in a yield of more than 1,100 jin per mu over a large area. 社员郭福来 (this seems to refer to a specific person who can't be found) cultivated two mu and eight fen of saline soil fields, implementing five-by-five-inch close planting, applying a large amount of neutralizing fertilizer such as grass ash, mixed fertilizer, and peanut cake, and constantly rinsing the salinity with fresh water, resulting in an average yield of 1,120 jin per mu. Through analyzing "sparrows," the entire brigade educated the masses with facts, powerfully breaking down conservative ideas.
    Every Plot Has Striving Goals
    Subsequently, everyone, based on the experience of these 1,000-jin fields, formulated this year's late rice production increase targets by different soil types and other conditions. The main measures are: Clay soil fields drew on 社员曾分治 (this seems to refer to a specific person who can't be found)'s experience in deep plowing and reasonable close planting, as well as the lessons learned from insufficient fertilization and the lesser use of potash fertilizer in the past. With reference to this year's conditions and target requirements, they are required to implement six-by-six-inch and six-by-seven-inch close planting, planting 14,400 to 16,700 clusters per mu, striving to achieve more than 300,000 effective panicles; the seeds used are "Qinggu Dasui" (likely a specific rice variety) with large panicles and many grains; deep plowing of the land is required to reach seven to eight inches; apply 20 dan of water fertilizer and 40 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer per mu as base fertilizer, apply another 20 dan of water fertilizer for the first topdressing, 20 jin of fertilizer powder for the second and third topdressings, and increase potash fertilizer. Semi-sandy soil fields have less organic matter, and rice is not easy to tiller. It is required to implement five-by-five-inch close planting, planting about 24,000 clusters per mu, with about nine seedlings per cluster; apply 80 dan of refined fertilizer per mu, such as grass ash, pig and cattle manure, duck manure, and mixed fertilizer, 25 dan of water fertilizer, and some toilet fertilizer. Saline soil fields also adopted the successful experience of farmer 郭福来 (this seems to refer to a specific person who can't be found) in rinsing with fresh water, using the salt-resistant "Qinggu Xiaosui" (likely a specific rice variety) seeds; implementing five-by-five-inch close planting, with about seven seedlings per cluster; applying 70 dan of refined fertilizer per mu, such as grass ash, mixed fertilizer, and green manure, as base fertilizer, 30 dan of water fertilizer as the first topdressing, and 45 jin of peanut cake as the second topdressing, and doing a good job of plant protection. In addition to formulating different bumper harvest targets and measures according to different soil types, the team also divided the entire 2,214 mu of late rice into 21 large plots and 78 small plots, ensuring that every plot has specific measures and targets.
    Face Difficulties and Overcome Difficulties
    After formulating the above production increase targets and measures, all seven production teams in the brigade organized cadres and experienced members to carefully analyze the favorable conditions and difficulties of the late-season bumper harvest campaign based on the situation of each team, and study ways to overcome the difficulties to ensure the realization of the bumper harvest plan. In terms of labor, the entire brigade needs more than 99,540 workdays for the late season, and is still short more than 17,300 workdays; in terms of production funds, a total of about 40,000 yuan is needed, but there is only 30,000 yuan now; in terms of technology, the need to promote 1,000-jin rice from a small area to a large area of bumper harvest fields requires organizing the masses to learn and master advanced production experience and science and technology; in addition, natural disasters such as drought, pests and diseases may occur.
    The solutions are: In terms of labor, all departments are required to strongly support the bumper harvest campaign, and all cadres participate in production, and more than 40 people are transferred from industry, sideline occupations and other departments to strengthen the agricultural front; at the same time, the existing new-style agricultural tools are fully utilized and new tools are further repaired and built, striving to achieve transportation vehicle and boatization, rice planting, harvesting, and inter-tillage weeding and irrigation semi-mechanization in the near future, in whole or in part, to improve work efficiency; taking the above measures can increase about 20,000 workdays, which can basically solve the problem of labor shortage. In terms of production funds, sideline production members, who account for about 10% of the total labor force of the brigade, persist in operating existing livestock, orchards, fisheries and other production, and further expand the channels for small-scale sideline occupations. It is estimated that cash income can be increased by 7,500 yuan in autumn; in addition, some agricultural tools and pesticides are manufactured by themselves as much as possible, reducing expenditures by several thousand yuan, which can completely solve the difficulty of insufficient funds. In terms of technology, it is decided to organize cadres and experienced old farmers to establish a 1,000-jin rice technology research and guidance institute in the brigade and a 1,000-jin rice technology research and guidance group in the small team, to research and guide the cultivation technology of bumper harvest fields according to the agricultural season; and to hold technical training classes to widely train members to learn production technology. In terms of preventing natural disasters, in addition to carefully spraying 666 powder in the seedling fields at present to strive to eliminate pests in the seedling fields, attention should be paid to the occurrence of pests at any time, and the principle of "treating early, treating small, and treating thoroughly" should be implemented; at the same time, seize the favorable opportunity after the recent rain to vigorously store and conserve water, further repair canals and dig ponds, build small-scale water conservancy, extend drought resistance capacity, and implement shallow water and frequent irrigation and rational water use to ensure that late rice is not threatened by drought. In addition, the entire brigade has more than 40 mu of low-yield fields, and it is decided to concentrate efforts to carry out shock transformation, requiring each mu to apply more than 1,000 jin of pig and cattle manure and 200 dan of river mud to further improve the soil and eliminate backward fields. The Party branch of the brigade also decided to send the deputy secretary and the secretary of the Youth League branch to the seventh production team, which has a poor work foundation, to strengthen leadership, strive for balanced development, and ensure the comprehensive and smooth development of the bumper harvest campaign in the entire brigade.
    Work Together to Prepare for Cultivation
    Due to the advanced production increase targets and effective measures of the Zhupu Brigade, and the full analysis of the favorable conditions, difficulties and ways to overcome the difficulties, all cadres and the masses actively participated in this campaign. Now all seven production teams and 18 production groups in the team have joined the hot bumper harvest competition campaign, and all cadres and nearly 700 members are full of fighting spirit and soaring enthusiasm. The fourth production team has more than 20 mu of clay soil fields with hardened soil that need to be improved with seaweed fertilizer. The captain, Lin Kengquan, led 12 members to row four small boats and braved the wind and rain to Haimen, more than 30 li away, to salvage 275 dan of seaweed fertilizer. The first production team immediately organized workers from the farm tool factory to rush to repair the missing farm tools. According to the needs of the measures for the bumper harvest fields, the fourth production team was still short of more than 1,000 yuan in production funds. The team immediately organized more than 50 members to engage in sideline occupations on a large scale without affecting the current agricultural production, and prepared all the production funds in more than 30 days. Since the end of May, the entire brigade has prepared an average of 100 dan of refined fertilizer and general fertilizer per mu for late rice fields in 40 days; in order to cultivate seedlings, the entire brigade sowed the seedling fields nearly one season earlier than last year, and more than 30 experienced old farmers were organized by the team to carefully manage them, so they grew vigorously. At present, the entire brigade is further stepping up preparations for cultivation, preparing to plant more and harvest more to ensure the realization of the late rice bumper harvest target.

    珠浦大队解剖高产“麻雀”
    晚稻增产措施具体周密
    充分利用新式农具，改造旧农具，解决劳力不足；开源节流，克服生产资金困难；蓄水保水，防止干旱；积造精肥，消灭落后田；加强工作基础薄弱队的领导，保证平衡增产。
    本报讯　福建省海澄县莲花公社珠浦大队干部和社员共同总结往年晚稻高产经验，参照今年的生产条件，具体制订出全队晚稻的增产指标和措施，大大鼓舞了广大群众的信心，轰轰烈烈的丰产竞赛运动正在迅速开展。
    解剖高产“麻雀”
    珠浦大队在开展晚稻丰产运动中，开头有人信心不足。队里为了解决这些人的思想问题，提高信心，确保晚稻丰产运动胜利展开，便组织干部和社员一起解剖高产“麻雀”，具体总结往年千斤田的经验，用本地的高产事实教育群众。参加这一次高产经验总结的干部和老年、壮年、青年农民共有六百多人。他们按不同土质和不同地段分片解剖了千斤以上的晚稻田三十多亩。以粘土田为例，1953年社员曾分治耕作的一丘二亩八分六的晚稻田，由于选用良种、实行六×七寸密植、亩施百担精肥，并战胜了病虫、干旱等自然灾害，结果亩产干谷一千一百十八斤。以半沙田为例，去年“河仔洋”有十三亩田实行合理密植、多施有机肥料等，结果成片地达到亩产一千一百余斤。社员郭福来耕作的二亩八分咸质田，实行了五×五寸密植，施下了大量的草木灰、混合肥、花生饼等中和咸性的肥料，和不断用淡水冲洗改咸，结果平均亩产也达一千一百二十斤。全队通过解剖“麻雀”以事实教育了群众，有力地打破了保守思想。
    片片有奋斗目标
    随后大家根据这些千斤田的经验，按不同土质和其他条件，分片订出今年晚稻的增产指标。主要措施是：粘土田吸取了社员曾分治实行深耕、合理密植等经验，和以前施肥不够合理、施用钾肥较少等教训，参照今年的条件和指标要求，要求实行六×六寸、六×七寸密植，亩插一万四千四百丛至一万六千七百丛，争取有效穗数达到三十万穗以上；种籽用穗大粒多的“青骨大穗”；土地深耕要求达到七、八寸；每亩施二十担水肥、四十担杂肥当基肥，第一遍追肥再施二十担水肥，第二、三遍追肥施二十斤肥田粉，并增加钾肥。半沙田，有机质较少，稻子不易分蘖，要求实行五×五寸密植，亩插二万四千丛左右，每丛九本左右；每亩施草木灰、猪牛粪、鸭粪、混合肥等精肥八十担、水肥二十五担和一部分厕所砒肥。咸质田也根据农民郭福来用淡水冲洗的成功经验，采用耐咸的“青骨小穗”种；实行五×五寸密植，每丛插七本左右；每亩施草木灰、混合肥、绿肥等精肥七十担当基肥，三十担水肥当第一遍追肥，四十五斤花生饼当第二遍追肥，并做好植物保护。队里除了根据不同土质制定不同的丰产指标和措施外，又把全队二千二百一十四亩晚稻，划分为二十一个大片、七十八个小片，做到片片都有具体的措施和指标。
    正视困难战胜困难
    在制订以上增产指标和措施后，全队七个生产队都组织干部和有经验的社员，根据各队情况，认真分析晚季丰产运动的有利条件和困难，并研究克服困难的办法，保证实现丰产计划。在劳力方面，全大队晚季共需要九万九千五百四十多工，尚欠一万七千三百多工；生产资金方面，共需要四万元左右，而现在只有三万元；技术方面，要由小面积的千斤稻推广为大面积的丰产田，需要组织群众学习和掌握先进生产经验和科学技术；此外，干旱、病虫等自然灾害可能发生。
    解决的办法是：劳力方面，要求各个部门大力支援丰产运动，干部人人参加生产，又从工业、副业等部门抽调四十多人加强农业战线；同时充分运用现有的新式农具和进一步修造新工具，争取在最近大部或部分实现运输车船化，插秧、收割、中耕除草灌溉半机械化，以提高工效；采取以上措施，可增加二万工左右，基本上可以解决劳力不足问题。在生产资金方面，约占全大队总劳力10％的副业生产社员，坚持经营现有的牧畜、果林、渔业等生产，并进一步扩大小宗副业门路，预计秋季可增加现金收入七千五百元；此外，有些农具、农药尽量自己制造，减少支出数千元，这样完全可以解决资金不足的困难。在技术方面，决定组织干部和有经验的老农，以大队成立千斤稻技术研究指导所，以小队成立千斤稻技术研究指导组，根据农事季节，研究指导丰产田的栽培技术；并举办技术训练班，普遍培训社员学习生产技术。在防止自然灾害方面，除目前认真地在秧田里喷射六六六粉，力争把虫害消灭在秧田里以外，要随时注意虫害发生情况，贯彻“治早、治小、治了”方针；同时，抓紧最近雨后有利时机，大力蓄水、保水，进一步修渠挖塘，兴修小型水利，延长抗旱能力和实行浅水勤灌、合理用水，确保晚稻不受干旱威胁。此外，全大队有四十多亩低产田，决定集中力量突击改造，要求每亩多施猪牛粪一千斤、河泥二百担，进一步改良土壤，消灭落后田。工作基础较差的第七生产队，大队党支部也决定派出副书记和团支部书记到这个队加强领导，力求平衡发展，确保全大队丰产运动全面顺利地开展。
    一齐动手忙备耕
    珠浦大队由于增产指标先进，措施有力，充分分析了有利条件、困难所在和克服困难的办法，因此全体干部和群众积极参加这一运动。现在队里的七个生产队和十八个生产组，全部投入了火热的丰产竞赛运动，全体干部和近七百名社员个个斗志昂扬，干劲冲天。第四生产队有二十多亩土壤板结的粘土田，需要用海肥改良土壤，队长林坑泉就领了十二个社员划着四条小船，冒着风雨到三十多里外的海门捞回二百七十五担的海肥。第一生产队立即组织农具厂的工人赶制修补所缺农具。第四生产队根据丰产田的措施需要，尚欠生产资金一千多元，队里在不影响当前农业生产的情况下，立即组织五十多个社员大搞副业，在三十多天中就备足了全部的生产资金。全大队从5月下旬以来，在四十天中，为晚稻田平均每亩已备有精肥和一般肥料一百担；为了培育秧苗，全大队比去年提早了近一个节令，播完了秧田，并由队里组织了三十多个有经验的老农精心管理，因此丘丘长得欣欣向荣。目前，全大队正在进一步加紧备耕，准备多种多收，确保实现晚稻丰产指标。
