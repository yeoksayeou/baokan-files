Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 17th - The Indonesian "People's Daily" has resumed publication on the 17th after being suspended for one day.

The Jakarta military authorities ordered the "People's Daily" to cease publication on the 16th because it published a news bulletin from the Air Force Intelligence Department. The Air Force Intelligence Department's bulletin expressed support for the cabinet's political program, but it hoped that Sukarno would directly lead the armed forces; the Air Force would have the fullest autonomy in handling administrative and financial matters.
