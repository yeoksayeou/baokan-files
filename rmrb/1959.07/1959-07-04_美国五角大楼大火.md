Xinhua News Agency, 3rd, Washington dispatch: A fire broke out in the US Department of Defense on the 2nd. The basement of the Pentagon, where many extremely secret devices and materials were placed, has been destroyed by fire. The burning lasted for five hours, with losses amounting to tens of millions of dollars. 30,000 Pentagon employees have stopped working as a result.

Fifty firefighters and building security personnel were injured. According to firefighters, the fire area was about 400 square feet. The damaged area is equal to four city blocks.

US Air Force authorities said that approximately 7,000 reels of "top secret" magnetic tape from giant data recording machines have been burned. These magnetic tapes recorded information about military personnel and Air Force facilities and activities.

US Secretary of Defense McElroy has ordered all Department of Defense staff, except those who need to be on duty for important work, to go home.

The fire started in a top-secret room in the Pentagon housing computers used by the Air Force. It is believed to have been caused by a fault in the electrical equipment.

    美国五角大楼大火
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部2日失火。放置许多极端秘密的装置和资料的五角大楼的地下室，已经被大火烧毁。焚烧历五小时，损失达数千万美元，五角大楼三万工作人员已经因此停止工作。
    有五十名救火员和大楼警卫人员受伤。据救火员说，火场面积达四百平方英尺左右。遭到损害的面积等于四个街区那么大。
    美国空军当局说，巨型资料记录机器的大约七千卷“绝密”的磁性带已经烧毁。这些磁性带上记录的是有关军事人员和空军设施与活动方面的资料。
    美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊已经命令国防部全体工作人员，除掉有重要工作需要值班的以外，都回家去。
    这场大火是从五角大楼一间装置着空军使用的计算机器的极端保密的密室内烧起来的。据信是由于电气设备上的毛病引起。
