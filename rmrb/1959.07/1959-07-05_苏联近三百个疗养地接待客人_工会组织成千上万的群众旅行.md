Xinhua News Agency, Moscow – Summer has arrived, and tens of thousands of Soviet working people are using their summer vacations to travel to various places. This year in the Soviet Union, trade unions alone have organized travel for 200,000 people, in addition to a large number of self-organized travelers. This year, there are 200 travel routes across the country, with about 200 travel bases and summer camps available for travelers along these routes.

In recent years, with the improvement of people's living standards, the number of travelers has gradually increased. In 1958, more than one million employees participated in travel, and this year the number of people participating in trade union-organized travel has almost doubled compared to 1956. Sports associations and trade unions in various regions have created excellent conditions for carrying out mass travel activities.

More than 50 travelers' clubs across the country organize various activities for travelers. New travel bases will be opened in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union, where few people traveled in the past. The magnificent communist construction there is attracting many travelers.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow – According to Soviet newspapers, the annual summer vacation life of the Soviet people has begun. The state has prepared excellent rest conditions for vacationing workers, farmers, and staff. According to incomplete statistics, there are now 295 sanatoriums of varying sizes in the Soviet Union. The number of sanatoriums and rest homes has increased from 2,600 in 1957 to 2,900.

The Russian Federation expects about 2.8 million people to go to sanatoriums and rest homes for rest this year. In Sochi, a famous Soviet resort city, six more sanatoriums and rest homes have recently begun welcoming vacationers from all over the Soviet Union. In the next seven years alone, 3,000 additional vacation beds will be added in Sochi. (Attached picture)

    新华社莫斯科电　夏天已经来到，苏联成千上万的劳动人民都利用夏季休假期间到各地去旅行。今年在苏联单是由工会组织去旅行的就有二十万人，此外还有大批自己组织的旅行者。今年全苏旅行的路线达二百条，在这些旅行路线上约有二百个旅行基地和夏令营供旅行者使用。
    近年来随着人民生活的提高，旅行的人数也逐渐增加，1958年有一百多万职工参加了旅行，今年参加工会组织的旅行人数几乎比1956年增加了一倍。各地体育协会和工会为开展群众性的旅行活动，创造了很好的条件。
    全国有五十多个旅行者俱乐部为旅行者组织各种活动，过去很少有人去旅行的苏联东部地区将开辟新的旅行基地，那里的宏伟的共产主义建设吸引着许多旅行家。
    新华社莫斯科电　据苏联报刊报道：苏联人民一年一度的夏季休假生活已经开始了。国家为休假的工人、农民、职员准备了优越的休息条件。据不完全统计，苏联现在已有大小不同的二百九十五个疗养地。疗养院和休养所已由1957年的二千六百所增加到二千九百所。
    俄罗斯联邦今年预计约有二百八十万人到疗养院和休养所去休息。在苏联著名的休养胜地索契城最近几个月又有六个疗养院和休养所开始迎接来自苏联各地的休养者。在今后七年期间，仅在索契城就要增加三千个休养床位。（附图片）
