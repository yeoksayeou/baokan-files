    Pay Attention to Developing the National Musical Instrument Industry
    National musical instruments are one of China's excellent national cultural heritages, loved by the broad masses of people for thousands of years.
    In recent years, the national musical instrument manufacturing industry has developed rapidly. The scattered individually-run apprenticeship shops have been merged into factories or cooperatives producing musical instruments, and some manual operations have been replaced by machinery. The production of various musical instruments has increased by more than double in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, and the quality of many musical instruments has also improved. However, due to the gradual improvement of the cultural life of the masses, the current production of musical instruments is still not fully meeting the demand. At the same time, due to the weakness of scientific research work on national musical instruments, the quality of musical instruments produced by some factories is still not high enough.
    In order to adapt to the development of the music and art industry, the national musical instrument industry needs to increase production and, more importantly, improve quality. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen scientific and technological research, summarize the manufacturing experience and special skills of veteran workers and folk artists into written materials, and organize timely teaching. Musical instrument factories and cooperatives in various regions should adopt the method of summarizing, researching, designing, and trial-producing simultaneously. After drawing certain conclusions in key technical research, they should strive to guide production with scientific methods in the shortest possible time. The inspection of musical instrument quality should also strive to use more scientific tools and instruments. China is a country with a long culture and abundant resources, and also a multi-ethnic country. There are many varieties of national musical instruments, and some musical instruments enjoy a high reputation. In order to maintain the fine tradition of national musical instruments, the manufacturing techniques of instruments such as the guan, hou, zhu, and chi, which have been lost before liberation, should be excavated and sorted out as soon as possible. Musical instrument factories and cooperatives in various regions should actively carry out publicity work, try to collect physical objects from the masses, and organize forces to repair and supplement them.
    Improving the supply relationship of raw materials is the key to ensuring the increase in production and improvement of the quality of national musical instruments. Although musical instruments are small products and do not use much material, the specifications of raw materials are strictly required and the production season is highly seasonal. Many raw materials such as python skin, resonant copper, and horsehair are rare raw materials. Relevant departments in various regions should actively help organize the supply of raw materials for national musical instruments. Musical instrument factories and cooperatives should also appropriately adjust supply relationships through local competent departments so that the main raw materials can be basically guaranteed.
    In order to meet the performance requirements of professional groups and the masses, musical instrument factories and cooperatives in various regions should absorb the opinions of the masses, draw on some of the advantages of Western musical instruments, and carry out product improvements. While preserving the traditional national style, they should improve the intonation of certain musical instruments and increase their range and expressive ability, so that the quality of musical instruments becomes better and better.

    注意发展民族乐器工业
    民族乐器是我国优秀的民族文化遗产之一，千百年来受到广大人民的喜爱。
    近几年来，民族乐器制作业发展很快，各地分散经营的师徒店已经合并成为生产乐器的工厂或合作社，部分手工操作已为机械所代替。各种乐器的生产，今年上半年比去年同期增长一倍以上，许多乐器的质量也有提高。但是，由于群众文化生活的逐步提高，目前乐器的生产还不能充分适应需要。同时由于民族乐器的科学研究工作力量薄弱，有些厂生产的乐器质量还不够高。
    为了适应音乐艺术事业的发展，民族乐器工业既需要提高产量，更需要提高质量。因此必须加强科学技术研究工作，把老工人和民间艺人的制作经验、特殊的工艺技巧，总结成文字资料，并且及时组织传授。各地乐器制造厂、社，应当采取边总结、边研究、边设计、边试制的方法，在关键性的技术研究方面得出一定结论以后，争取在最短时间内用科学方法指导生产。对乐器质量的检查，也应争取使用比较科学的工具和仪器。我国是一个文化悠久、物产丰富的国家，也是一个多民族的国家，民族乐器品种繁多，而且有些乐器享有很高的声誉，为了保持民族乐器的优良传统，应该尽快把那些解放以前就已经失传了的管、篌、筑、篪等乐器的制作技术，加以发掘和整理。各地乐器厂、社，应该积极作好宣传工作，设法在群众中搜集实物，组织力量，进行修复和补充。
    改善原材料供应关系，是保证民族乐器增产和提高质量的关键，乐器虽然是一种小产品，用料不多，但是原材料规格要求严格，产期季节性大，有很多原料像蟒皮、响铜、马尾等等都是稀有原料，各地有关部门应该积极帮助组织民族乐器的原料材料供应工作，乐器厂、社，也应该通过当地主管部门，适当调整供应关系，使主要原材料能有基本保证。
    为了满足专业团体和群众的演奏要求，各地乐器厂、社应该吸收群众的意见，吸取西洋乐器的某些优点，进行产品改良工作，在保存民族传统风格的前提下，改进某些乐器的音准，增加它们的音域范围和表现能力，使乐器质量越来越好。
