Fully Utilize Land and Develop Agricultural Production
    Novotný's Report at the Michalovce Activists' Meeting

    (Reported by this newspaper) "Red Rights Daily" of Czechoslovakia published on June 2nd, Comrade Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, delivered a report on May 30th at the meeting of party and agricultural workers in Michalovce. Excerpts are as follows:

    On the initiative of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, we have embarked on an unprecedented endeavor: to obtain new fertile land for the further development of agriculture and the entire national economy. It is extremely correct that we now focus all our attention on expanding and reclaiming new land, as it is the main means of production in agriculture. Utilizing agricultural land and adopting large-scale production methods is the right path to accomplish the enormous tasks facing our agriculture as outlined by the Eleventh Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

    Fully Utilize Every Hectare of Land

    The tasks before us, in building socialism and communism in our country, require not only the unprecedented development of productive forces in industry but also the unprecedented development of productive forces in agriculture.

    We must use large-scale agricultural production to improve our agriculture and thereby ensure that our society has abundant agricultural products. Only collective, highly refined, large-scale agricultural production can meet the growing needs of the people and our national economy.

    The primary task in this regard is to fully utilize land—the basic means of production in agriculture. In fact, people often do not view land this way. People only see machines as means of production, while little attention is paid in some places to the utilization, reclamation, and improvement of land productivity. Some land has not been utilized afterward. There is also a common phenomenon: houses with gardens are built on farmland without hesitation, and enterprises fence off some fertile land around their factories. The phenomenon of shrinking cultivated land area must be stopped immediately. Factories and enterprises that occupy land must provide products to the government. Similarly, the phenomenon of four hundred thousand hectares of land having no owner cannot be considered a good thing.

    The Central Committee has often emphasized the need to pay attention to intensive farming and land utilization. In our republic, only 0.38 hectares of arable land are allocated per person, which is not much. For us, it is necessary to correctly and purposefully utilize every hectare of land, and first of all, to strengthen agricultural production per unit area to increase the yield per hectare.

    We are now facing a moment of making important decisions about the direction of agricultural production. In which direction should our agriculture develop? What is the main thing in agriculture—animal husbandry or crop production?

    In the past, a view was often discussed (and many people still think this way) that our agriculture should develop in the direction of animal husbandry, while the necessary feed and grain are imported from abroad. This led to the following views and results: there is no need to care about one's own sufficient feed base, no need to care about crop production, no need to care about cultivated land, and no need to engage in intensive farming. The proportion of humus in the soil in our fields has decreased, and in many places, expensive soil improvement equipment has been abandoned for a long time, and thousands of hectares of land are wasted. Based on this view, the incomprehensible "theory" that the feed value of corn is very poor has emerged, resulting in a cold attitude towards the cultivation of corn. All of this must end, because in this situation we cannot complete the tasks put forward by the Eleventh Congress in agriculture.

        Crop Production is the Foundation

    Crop production is the main sector of agricultural production, and it is now and will always be the foundation of agricultural production.

    We must adopt very refined methods of cultivating the land. We must cultivate the land using gardening methods, using mechanized tools, and using investment in this area. All of this, under our conditions, especially here in East Slovakia, makes it possible for us to have two harvests a year.

    While we focus on the development of crop production, we do not at all deny the significance of animal husbandry, or even push it into a secondary position. The entire agricultural production is a kind of interconnected whole. However, it is not acceptable to simply make animal husbandry the darling of agriculture. We must have a reliable, high-quality feed base to bring animal husbandry production to a high level.

    From the perspective of crop production and animal husbandry production, the help of the Soviet Union is of inestimable significance to us, because the Soviet Union supplies us with a large amount of grain. But I want to emphasize that in the next five years, we must ensure self-sufficiency to a greater extent than now.

    The fact that we consider crop production to be the basic link in agricultural production clearly shows that the state's assistance and the development of our investment policy should give priority to that aspect. We must help to use investment first on the land, so that the cooperatives can obtain very high yields, thereby consolidating these cooperatives, while ensuring that the members have good incomes.

    We must launch soil improvement work. Our country does not have enough water, so it is necessary to use water economically, and first of all, use it to supply the needs of residents, industry, and maintain the amount of water needed for agriculture. The significance of the large-scale water conservancy projects that we are now starting in the East Slovak Basin lies in this. These projects are of great significance to our country, mainly to the comprehensive development of the entire East Slovakia.

    In addition to large-scale water conservancy projects, small-scale soil improvement work is also placed in the first place. In most cases, this work should be done by the cooperative members themselves, and soil improvement cooperatives should be established. We also establish soil improvement stations to concentrate human and material resources, and it is very important for the state to help them use all possibilities to improve the land and further develop agricultural production. We are willing to help cooperatives with loans so that they can build reservoirs and have enough water to irrigate the fields. Small reservoirs and ponds are of great significance to agriculture. Building small ponds will be compensated quickly. It can not only irrigate the fields, but also raise fish, ducks, and geese.

    High-quality cultivation of the land and refined management of crop production require us to pay close attention to mechanized methods, new technologies, and artificial fertilizers.

    Giving the machines to the cooperatives will allow us to use these machines much more economically. However, this important measure requires cooperatives to establish the necessary financial funds to purchase machines, and requires cooperatives to train their own mechanical personnel, who are the guarantee of fully utilizing and well caring for technical equipment.

      Better Utilize the Principle of Material Incentives

    Now it is important that we also implement the principle of material incentives in agriculture. We have decided to change the current procurement system from next year and greatly simplify agricultural planning. This will enable cooperatives to better and more fully adapt to the needs of the state than they do now, and they can use natural and economic conditions to expand production and reduce production costs.

    For this purpose, a new procurement system will be implemented and new prices for agricultural products will be stipulated. The solution of material incentives should now be seen as a driving force for further development of agricultural production by cooperative members and those who work in agriculture. However, we must learn more from industrial enterprises in this regard. Obviously, the initiative of cooperative members is first and foremost in the correct and affirmative economic incentives. In fact, the reason why we can solve this problem so well is precisely because of the new organization of industrial enterprises.

    Without rewards based on the completion of quotas in crop production and animal husbandry, without a certain classification of rational labor organization, unified agricultural cooperatives cannot expand production, cannot achieve stable working days, and cannot strengthen common cultivation groups.

    Under the socialist system, material concern for one's own labor results leads to increased production and promotes the improvement of the living standards of the working people. The principle of material concern, until now, has not been fully utilized in agricultural production, especially in the relationship between agricultural enterprises and the state. The basic principle of labor rewards under the socialist system should be the same for workers and peasants. Moreover, we don't even need to say that the current implementation of two agricultural product pricing systems often supports the self-sufficiency mentality among cooperative members. Among them, especially among the members of advanced cooperatives, there is often a view that they no longer need anything. But the problem is not only in them, the problem is in the society that needs agricultural commodities. We hope that the implementation of new prices will be a way to reverse this trend. The two prices that are currently implemented are a stage of agricultural development that is already outdated and does not conform to the principle of material concern.

  The implementation of the principle of material concern in agriculture is largely related to whether there is enough labor. These problems largely help us solve the problems of large-scale production and new technologies. In this way, agriculture will become more attractive, especially to our young people, because the methods of labor in agriculture will change, there will no longer be the kind of heavy labor that exists now, and there will be enough time to engage in cultural activities. This is the road that can and will guarantee that we will have enough labor in agriculture in the future and fully utilize technology and mechanization.

    Until now, the rate of growth of agricultural production has lagged far behind the rate of industrial development, and this has created an intolerable imbalance, which has caused difficulties for the entire national economy. If the agricultural situation cannot be reversed as instructed by the Central Committee of the CPC, then there will be no talk of realizing the task of completing socialist construction.

    The whole party must fully grasp the task of developing large-scale agricultural production, treat it as its own task, and resolutely fight and work for its realization. The realization of our agricultural policy is one of the primary tasks of the party and all party members. We should use our labor and mobilize all our strength to do this work.

### 充分利用土地和发展农业生产  诺沃提尼在米哈洛夫切积极分子会议上作报告

    充分利用土地和发展农业生产
    诺沃提尼在米哈洛夫切积极分子会议上作报告
    本报讯　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”6月2日刊登了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央第一书记诺沃提尼同志5月30日在米哈洛夫切党和农业工作者积极分子会议上的报告。摘译如下：
    根据捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会的倡议，我们开始了一桩从未有过的事业：为了农业以及整个国民经济的进一步发展，我们必须获得新的肥沃的土地。现在我们把一切注意力集中在扩大和开垦新土地上是极其正确的，因为它是农业的主要生产资料。利用农业土地和采用大规模的生产方式是完成捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会摆在我们农业面前的巨大任务的正确道路。
    充分利用每一公顷土地
    摆在我们面前的、在我国建成社会主义和共产主义的任务，不仅要求工业中的生产力进一步空前发展，而且要求农业中的生产力也取得空前的发展。
    要用大规模的农业生产来提高我们的农业，并由此保证我们社会有丰富的农产品。只有集体的、极精细的大规模农业生产才能够满足人民和我国国民经济不断增长的需要。
    这方面的首要任务是要充分利用土地——农业中的基本生产资料。事实上人们往往不是这样看待土地的。人们只把机器看作生产资料，至于说到利用、开垦土地，以及提高土地的产量，有些地方是很少注意的。有些土地以后也都没有加以利用。还常常有这种现象：毫不吝惜地在农地上建造带花园的住宅，企业在自己厂房的周围圈了一些肥沃的土地。耕地面积缩小的现象必须立即停止，要保证耕地面积能够扩大，占了土地的工厂企业必须向政府提供产品。同样，也不能把四万公顷土地上还没有主人的这种现象说成是好现象。
    中央委员会常常强调必须注意精耕细作和利用土地。在我们共和国中，每人平均才分配到零点三八公顷的不多的可耕土地。这对我们来说，应该正确和有目的地利用每一公顷土地，首先应该加强单位面积上的农业生产，以提高每公顷的收获量。
    我们现在正面临着要对农业生产的方向采取重要决定的时刻。我们的农业应该朝什么方向发展？什么是农业中主要的——畜牧业生产呢还是种植业生产？
    从前常常谈到一种观点（现在许多人仍然这样想），这种观点认为，我们的农业应该朝着畜牧业生产的方向发展，而必需的饲料和粮食则从外国进口。由此就产生了下述看法和结果：不必去关心自己的足够的饲料基地，不必关心种植业生产，不必关心耕种的土地，不必精耕细作。现在我们田地中的腐植土所占的比例下降了，甚至许多地方长时期来价值昂贵的改良土壤的设备弃置不用，几千公顷的土地在白白浪费。在这种看法的基础上，产生了无法理解的玉蜀黍的饲料价值很差的“理论”，其结果，引起了对待玉蜀黍的耕种的冷淡态度。必须结束这一切，因为在这种情况下我们是不能完成第十一次代表大会在农业方面提出的任务的。
        种植业生产是基础
    种植业生产是农业生产的主要部门，它现在和将来都是农业生产的基础。
    我们要采用非常精细的耕种田地的方法。要用田园化方法来耕种田地，采用机械化工具，并且在这方面利用投资。这一切在我国的条件下，特别是在这里，在东斯洛伐克，使我们有可能一年有两次收成。
    我们一面把重点放在发展种植业的生产上，一面也完全不否定畜牧业的意义，甚至不把它排挤到次要地位。整个农业生产是某种一环套着一环的整体。但是，要单单把畜牧业变成农业中的宠儿，这是不能同意的。我们要有一个可靠的、质量高的饲料基地，才能把畜牧业生产提到高度水平。
    从种植业和畜牧业生产的观点来看，苏联的帮助对我们有难以估价的意义，因为苏联供应我们大量的谷物。但是我要强调指出，在今后五年内要比现在在更大的程度上保证自给自足。
    我们认为种植业是农业生产的基本环节这一事实清楚地表明，国家的帮助和我们投资政策的发展应该优先照顾那一方面。我们要帮助把投资首先用在田地上，要使合作社获得很高的收获量，从而巩固这些合作社，同时保障社员有很好的收入。
    我们要展开土壤改良工作。我们国家没有足够的水，因此必须经济地利用水，并且首先利用来供应居民、工业的需要和保持农业需要的水量。我们现在开始在东斯洛伐克盆地进行的大规模水利工程的意义就在于此。这些工程对我们国家，主要是对全面发展整个东斯洛伐克有很大意义。
    除去大规模的水利工程之外，小型的土壤改良工作也放在第一位，这些工作在大多数情况下应该由合作社社员自己出力去做，成立土壤改良合作社。我们还建立土壤改良站，把人力和物力集中起来，由国家帮助它们利用一切可能来改良土地从而进一步发展农业生产，这是非常重要的事。我们愿意用贷款帮助合作社，使它们能建造贮水池和有足够的水量来灌溉田地。小贮水池和池塘对农业有很大意义。建造小水池很快就会得到补偿。它不仅可以浇田地，而且能养鱼、养鸭、养鹅。
    高质量地耕作田地和精细经营种植业生产要求我们十分注意机械化方法、新技术和人造肥料。
    把机器交给合作社会使我们大大经济地使用这些机器。但是，这一重要的措施要求合作社建立必要的财政基金来购买机器，要求合作社给自己培养机械人员，他们是充分地利用和很好的照料技术设备的保障。
      更好地利用物质关心的原则
    现在重要的是，我们在农业中也贯彻利用物质关心的原则。我们决定从明年起改变现在的征购制度，大加简化农业计划工作。这就能使合作社比现在更好地、更多地适应国家的需要，可以利用自然条件和经济条件来扩大生产和降低生产成本。
    为了这一目的，将实行新的征购制度和规定农产品的新价格。现在应该把解决物质关心问题看成是进一步发展合作社社员和在农业中劳动的人的农业生产的动力。但是，这里必须向工业企业多多学习。显然，合作社社员主动性的发挥首先在于正确肯定的经济刺激。实际上我们所以能很好地解决这个问题，正是由于工业企业的新组织。
    在种植业和畜牧业中没有以完成定额为基础的奖励，没有合理劳动组织的一定分类，统一农业合作社就不能扩大生产，不能达到劳动日的稳定，不能加强共耕组。
    在社会主义制度下，对自己劳动成果的物质关心引起生产的提高，并且促进劳动人民生活水平的提高。物质关心的原则，到现在为止，没有在农业生产中充分加以利用，尤其是在农业企业和国家的相互关系上。在社会主义制度下劳动奖励的基本原则对工人和农民来说应该是一样的。而且我们更不必说，现在实行两种农产品价格制度常常会支持合作社社员中的自足的情绪。在他们中间，尤其是先进合作社的社员中间常常还有这样一种观点：即他们已经什么都不需要。但是问题不仅在于他们，问题在于需要农业商品的社会。我们希望，实行新价格将是扭转这种风气的办法。现在实行的两种价格，这是已过时的农业发展阶段了，它不符合物质关心的原则。
  在农业中实行物质关心的原则在很大程度上同有没有足够劳动力有关。这些问题在很大程度上帮助我们解决大规模生产和新技术的问题。这样，农业就将成为更吸引人的了，尤其对我国青年人来说是如此，因为，在农业中劳动方法要改变了，不会再有现在那样的笨重劳动，有足够的时间来从事文化活动。这就是能够而且一定会保证我们将来在农业中有足够的劳动力和充分地利用技术和机械化的道路。
    到现在为止，农业生产增长的速度还大大落后于工业发展的速度，因此就产生了令人不能容忍的不平衡状态，这种不平衡引起了整个国民经济的困难。如果不能像捷共中央所指示的那样扭转农业的局面，那以后就谈不上实现完成社会主义建设的任务。
    全党必须充分地抓起发展大规模农业生产的任务，把它当作自己的任务，并为它的实现而坚决的斗争和工作。实现我们的农业政策，这是党和全体党员的首要任务之一。我们应该用自己的劳动和动员一切力量来做这一工作。
