Is the current division of labor between physical and mental labor unreasonable?
    ——Starting from Mencius' Refutation of Chen Xiang
    Wang Che

    There was a man from the State of Chu who believed in the doctrines of Shen Nong, named Xu Xing. He went from Chu to Teng, personally went to Duke Wen of Teng and said: "I am from afar, I heard that you practice benevolent governance, please give me a place to live and let me be your citizen!" Duke Wen of Teng settled him. Xu Xing also brought dozens of disciples, all wearing coarse cloth clothes, earning their living by making straw sandals and weaving mats. At that time, Chen Liang's disciple, Chen Xiang, also carried farming tools and came from the State of Song to Teng to become a commoner. Chen Xiang met Xu Xing and admired him very much, abandoning all that he had learned in the past and learning from Xu Xing. Chen Xiang saw Mencius and promoted Xu Xing's ideas, saying: "The ruler of Teng is indeed a wise ruler, but he has not yet heard the Dao. A wise ruler tills the land and eats with the people. Now Teng has granaries full of grain and treasuries full of money, which is exploiting the people to support himself. How can he be called wise!"

    Mencius said: "Does Xu Xing have to grow his own grain to eat?"

    Chen Xiang said: "Yes."

    Mencius: "Then, does Xu Xing also have to weave his own cloth to wear?"

    Chen Xiang: "No."

    Mencius: "Is the hat that Xu Xing wears also made by himself?"

    Chen Xiang: "No, he exchanged grain for it."

    Mencius: "Why doesn't Xu Xing make his own hat?"

    Chen Xiang: "If he made his own hat, it would interfere with his farming."

    Mencius: "Does Xu Xing use a pot to cook rice and an iron plow to till the land?"

    Chen Xiang: "Yes."

    Mencius: "Are the pot and plow made by Xu Xing himself?"

    Chen Xiang: "No, they were also exchanged for."

    Mencius: "Is taking grain to exchange for tools exploiting the potters and blacksmiths? Conversely, are the potters and blacksmiths taking tools to exchange for grain exploiting the farmers? Let me ask you: Why doesn't Xu Xing become a potter and blacksmith? Why is he not afraid of trouble and has to go to the market to trade with all the artisans for everything?"

    Chen Xiang: "If a person wants to do all the crafts, he cannot take care of farming."

    Mencius: "Can the person who governs the world take care of farming! There are things for adults to do and things for children to do, each has its own division of labor; if you ask one person to do everything and rely on himself for everything, then he will only have to run around all day long and not be worked to death? Therefore, some people labor with their minds and some people labor with their bodies. Those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their bodies are governed by others. Those who are governed support those who govern, and those who govern are supported by those who are governed. This is the universal principle of the world."

          ×　×　×　×

    The above story comes from the "Teng Wen Gong" chapter of the book "Mencius." The debate at that time ended with Mencius' victory. How should we judge the merits of this debate now?

    At first glance, we seem to should support Xu Xing and Chen Xiang, because they advocate "he who does not work, neither shall he eat." The standard of "wise ruler" in their minds is "tilling and eating with the people, cooking and governing."

    This is precisely what Mencius opposed. Mencius believed that the ruler and the ruled were a division of labor between mental and physical labor, and this division of labor was based on an objective necessity. People have many needs, and it is impossible to rely on oneself for everything. This requires a division of labor. With a division of labor, there needs to be exchange. But people have personal affairs and public affairs, material needs and spiritual needs. The duty of "sages" and monarchs is to manage these things, which is called "governing the world." Since those who govern the world have to labor with their minds, they cannot take care of physical labor, so they should be supported by those who labor with their bodies.

    If someone brings out these words today as a political proposition, it would undoubtedly be reactionary. However, under the historical conditions at that time, Mencius' words only reflected an objective fact. Mencius believed that this fact was reasonable, and he used the necessity of division of labor to prove the rationality of this fact. Is Mencius' set of arguments wrong? It should be admitted that Mencius' argument has a reasonable side. The historical necessity of the division of labor between mental and physical labor has been proven by Marxism.

    Of course, this division of labor did not exist from the beginning of human society. In the beginning, the chiefs of tribal societies also engaged in physical labor like other members, and they were not completely detached from production. Only later did a ruling group that completely got rid of physical labor gradually appear.

    What Xu Xing's faction admired was precisely the society before the emergence of classes. The division of labor between mental and physical labor and the emergence of classes were both a necessary and progressive phenomenon in history. Xu Xing's proposition was essentially a regression under the historical conditions at that time.

    But Mencius also beautified this relationship between mental and physical labor, making it eternally reasonable. When the division of labor between mental and physical labor began to sprout, a small number of managers did undertake certain social duties under the supervision of the collective to protect the common interests of all members. But with the development of society, social functions increasingly gained greater independence, finally developing into domination of society, and the servants of society were transformed into the masters of society. Here, it is not simply a division of labor between mental and physical labor, but also a relationship of exploitation and being exploited.

            ×　×　×

    Some people say in their articles that the division of labor between physical and mental labor is always needed, because only this division of labor can "give people greater roles" and "otherwise it will bury talent"; on the other hand, in socialist and communist societies, "this division of labor is friendly cooperation... There is no distinction between high and low, and the material and political treatment is completely equal." (Wei Gao) "What causes inequality and unreasonableness between mental and physical labor is class, the exploitation system, and the private ownership system... As for communist society... Everyone appears as a social worker, so everyone's status is equal." (Xu Junzheng)

    This is to say that the division of labor between mental and physical labor is always conducive to the development of productivity, and the only unreasonable aspect of the relationship between physical and mental laborers lies in inequality. As long as classes are eliminated, the two will be equal, so there is no need to eliminate the division of labor between the two.

    Conversely, some comrades also take "equality" as a yardstick to explain that the division of labor between physical and mental labor must be eliminated immediately:

    "What we want to eliminate is the division of labor between mental and physical labor, to eliminate the unequal phenomenon of a part of society specializing in intellectual activities and another part specializing in physical labor, not to eliminate the differences between the two labor forms themselves, because this is impossible to eliminate." (Yu Changbin)

    Please note that here the author believes that the differences between the two forms of labor, physical labor and mental labor, cannot be eliminated. Therefore, the fundamental way to eliminate the division of labor between physical and mental labor, as he says, is not to highly develop productivity and realize mechanization, electrification, automation, etc. (only on this basis will the differences between the two labor forms be eliminated), but for physical laborers to participate in mental labor and for mental laborers to participate in physical labor:

      "The Party's proposed cadre's down-to-earth work, labor training; workers participating in the management of enterprises; factories and people's communes running schools, and schools running factories (farms)... are all important measures taken to solve this problem, so that mental labor and physical labor are combined, fundamentally eliminating the division of labor between the two." (Emphasis added by me)

    Mencius eternally rationalized the relationship between mental and physical laborers from the point of view of division of labor, while Xu Xing demanded the abolition of this division of labor relationship from the point of view of equality. Now, some people also try to prove that the difference between mental and physical laborers will always exist from the point of view of division of labor, while others demand the immediate abolition of this division of labor from the point of view of equality, and mistakenly believe that some of the policies currently implemented by the Party are eliminating this division of labor. The common mistake on both sides lies in deviating from specific historical conditions.

                        ×　×　×

    In fact, division of labor is a historical category, and equality is also a historical category.

    It is untenable to defend the eternity of division of labor by citing differences in talent. The working people are by no means lacking in scientific and artistic talents, but most of them do not get the opportunity to develop them. From a historical point of view, the differences in talents of various people in society are not the cause of division of labor, but the result of division of labor. The differences in the natural talents of human beings were not as great as they are today. Only because the division of labor has become increasingly refined and the occupations have become increasingly complex have the talents of people developed in a variety of ways. The old fixed division of labor, on the one hand, promoted the development of certain people and certain talents, and on the other hand, it also restricted the development of other people and other talents. Wei Gao said that without division of labor, talents would be buried. He did not realize that for the majority of the working people, many of their scientific and artistic talents were precisely buried by the old fixed division of labor.

    What dominates the development of division of labor is not the development of human talents, but the development of productive forces. This is the viewpoint of historical materialism.

    Mencius lived more than two thousand years ago, of course, he would not have imagined that in the future social productive forces would develop to the point where everyone would only need to work for a very short time every day, and that a person must also labor with his mind when he labors with his body—using a wealth of scientific and technological knowledge. By that time, Mencius' argument (that one must get rid of productive labor in order to have time to engage in mental labor) will completely lose its reality. It is not surprising that Mencius could not see this, but today we should be able to see that the division of labor between mental and physical labor is by no means eternally reasonable.

    Another opposite view: The division of labor between physical and mental labor is unreasonable and should be abolished immediately without hesitation. This involves a question: What is the standard of reasonable or unreasonable?

    According to some comrades, everything that is equal is reasonable, and everything that is unequal is unreasonable.

    What is the error in this way of thinking? The error lies in looking at problems not from the needs of material life, from actual historical conditions, but from abstract moral concepts.

    Marxism is different from utopian socialism. It not only says that capitalism "should" be eliminated because capitalism is inhumane, and that socialism "should" be established because socialism is beautiful, etc., but further finds out the laws of capitalist development, thus pointing out that capitalism is "bound" to be eliminated and socialism is "bound" to win. "Should" or "should not" is not our starting point. Our starting point is the objective inevitable law. We decide what we "should" do or "should not" do according to the objective inevitable law.

    Going from primitive society to class society is going from equality to inequality, but this is a development of human history, a progress, because class society has advanced the productive forces of primitive society. The phenomenon of inequality in class society will also be eliminated in communist society, which is also progress because it is also conducive to the development of productive forces.

    Therefore, the fundamental problem is not equality or inequality, but the objective needs of social productivity development. If a certain equality hinders the development of social productivity, it is unreasonable, and it will be abolished by further development in history. If a certain inequality is conducive to the development of social productivity, it will continue to exist.

    What is called reasonable or unreasonable should be viewed historically and specifically. "Each stage of development of social relations is just and reasonable for their time and conditions." (Engels: "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy") Reasonable means conforming to the laws of social development. The division of labor between physical and mental labor is a product of somewhat developed but not sufficiently developed productive forces. Under these historical conditions, the occurrence and development of this division of labor is also reasonable. Only after the productive forces are highly developed can this division of labor be eliminated.

    Although our country has made rapid progress since liberation, our country is still a "poor and blank" country. "Poor" means economic backwardness, and "blank" means cultural backwardness. Can we let the workers and peasants in our country engage in mental labor? Of course not. If their time spent on physical labor is greatly reduced, there will be a serious shortage of necessities of life immediately. Moreover, they generally do not have enough cultural knowledge. It will take a considerable amount of time to eliminate illiteracy among the people across the country and to enable all the people to learn science and learn theory. From the perspective of intellectuals, if the division of labor between mental and physical labor is abolished now, and intellectuals are asked to grow their own land to support themselves, then the development of culture and science will stagnate, and of course, it will directly or indirectly cause confusion in production. Therefore, demanding the immediate abolition of the division of labor between physical and mental labor is an attempt to leap over the process of historical development, and the result will only cause the backwardness of productive forces. That is to say, the division of labor between physical and mental labor is necessary and reasonable at this stage.

    Of course, there is no absolutely reasonable thing. Here again, Engels' words are useful: "Everything real in the realm of human history becomes unreasonable in the course of time, and therefore is already unreasonable by its nature, and has long contained unreasonableness." ("Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy") The division of labor between physical and mental labor ultimately restricts the all-round development of people, making people bound to a fixed occupation for life, and thus hindering the development of productive forces in some aspects. Therefore, this division of labor also contains unreasonable elements. At this stage, these unreasonable elements are not the main aspects, but in the future, this division of labor will increasingly lose its rationality and increasingly expose its unreasonableness. Therefore, we must actively prepare conditions now so as to gradually eliminate this division of labor when the time is ripe in the future.

    The idea of always maintaining the division of labor between physical and mental labor is wrong, and this division of labor must be eliminated in the future. — This is the theory of continuous revolution on this issue. The idea of trying to eliminate this division of labor at this stage is also wrong, and this division of labor is still necessary to maintain at present. — This is the theory of the stages of revolutionary development on this issue.

                      ×　×　×

    Are the current participation of intellectuals in labor and the participation of workers in production management, etc., "the combination of physical and mental labor"? It should be said that most of them are not.

    It should be admitted that a knowledge worker, when participating in agricultural labor such as carrying soil, transporting fertilizer, and digging the ground, although he can also learn some very useful knowledge, he does not need to use his brain all the time in this kind of labor. In fact, his time is divided into two parts: in his own work, he is a mental worker rather than a physical worker; in the time he spends on physical labor, he temporarily becomes a physical worker rather than a mental worker. Physical labor and mental labor only alternate with each other, and are not integrated together. But if our agriculture realizes a high degree of mechanization, electrification, and automation, it will be different. Engaging in this kind of agricultural labor requires considerable scientific knowledge. It is difficult for you to say whether the farmers at that time are physical laborers or mental laborers.

    Cadres planting experimental fields and schools implementing the combination of education and productive labor, there is indeed some degree of combination of mental and physical labor here, but it is not a complete combination. In the future communist society, the difference between the two forms of labor, mental and physical labor, will disappear, and that will be a complete combination.

    The Party's current policy of cadres going to the countryside and workers participating in production management, etc., is to eliminate the estrangement between intellectuals and workers and peasants, and to pave the way for the future elimination of the two divisions of labor. This policy is absolutely necessary. However, if we think that this is a transition to communism, and think that the laborers in communist society also engage in pure physical labor for a part of the time and pure mental labor for another part of the time as they do now, then we are lowering the ideals of communism.

    Trying to get everyone to equally engage in mental labor for a part of the time and participate in physical labor for another part of the time, thinking that this is equality, is actually a kind of egalitarianism. Usually, egalitarianism is manifested in consumption, but here we see that egalitarianism also has its manifestations in productive labor.

    The two types of people, physical laborers and mental laborers, can be combined at present, and this combination is what we often call "the combination of intellectuals and workers and peasants." As for realizing the complete "equality" of physical laborers and mental laborers, the way is not to level each other, but to greatly develop productive forces and carry out the cultural and technological revolution. When the difference between physical labor and mental labor disappears, the difference between physical laborers and mental laborers also disappears.

### 现阶段体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工是不合理的吗？——从孟子驳陈相说起

    现阶段体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工是不合理的吗？
    ——从孟子驳陈相说起
    王澈
    楚国有一个信仰神农学说的人，名叫许行。他从楚国到滕国，亲到滕文公门前说：“我是远方的人，听说你行仁政，请你给我住的地方，让我做你的老百姓吧！”滕文公就安顿了他。许行还带着几十个门徒，都穿粗布衣服，靠打草鞋和编席子为生。那时陈良的门徒陈相，也背着耒耜，从宋国到滕国来当老百姓。陈相认识了许行，非常佩服，把自己过去学的一套全不要了，向许行学习。陈相看见孟子就宣扬许行的主张，说：“滕国的君主固然是一个贤君，不过还没有闻道。贤君是与老百姓一同种地一同吃饭的，如今滕国有盛粮食的仓廪，放钱的府库，这是剥夺老百姓来养自己，怎么能称得上贤呢！”
    孟子说：“许行一定要自己种粮食才吃饭吗？”
    陈相说：“是的。”
    孟子：“那么，许行也一定要自己织布才穿衣吗？”
    陈相：“不是。”
    孟子：“许行带的帽子也是自己做的吗？”
    陈相：“不是，那是他用粮食换来的。”
    孟子：“许行为什么不自做帽子？”
    陈相：“他要自己做帽子，就妨碍他种地了。”
    孟子：“许行用锅烧饭，用铁犁地吗？”
    陈相：“是的。”
    孟子：“锅和犁都是许行自己造的吗？”
    陈相：“不是，也是换来的。”
    孟子：“拿粮食换器具，是不是剥夺陶工铁匠呢？反过来，陶工铁匠拿器具换粮食，是不是剥夺了农民呢？我且问你：许行为什么不做陶工和铁匠？他为什么不怕麻烦，样样都要到市上去和百工作交易？”
    陈相：“一个人要做百工，就不能兼顾种地了。”
    孟子：“难道治天下的人能够顾得上种地吗！有大人办的事情，有小人办的事情，各有各的分工；如果叫一个人行行都做，样样都靠自己，那他就只好一天到晚奔走不停，不会忙死吗？所以说，有的人劳心，有的人劳力。劳心者是治人的，劳力者是被人治的，被治理的人供养治理的人，治理的人受被治理的人供养，这是天下的通义。”
          ×　×　×　×
    上面这个故事，出自“孟子”一书的“滕文公”上章。当时的辩论，是以孟子的胜利而告终。我们现在来判断这场辩论的是非，应当怎么说呢？
    乍一看，我们好像应该支持许行和陈相，因为他们是主张“不劳动者不得食”的。他们心目中的“贤君”的标准是“与民并耕而食，饔飧而治”，就是同吃同劳动。
    这一点正是孟子所反对的。孟子认为，统治者和被统治者，是一种劳心和劳力的分工关系，这种分工是基于一种客观的必要。人的需要很多，样样都靠自己，是不行的。这就需要分工。既有分工，就需要交换。但是人除了个人的事务，还有公共的事务，除了物质的需要，还有精神的需要。“圣人”和君主的职务，就是管理这些事情，这叫做“治天下”。治天下的人既然要劳心，就顾不上劳力，因此他们应该受劳力者供养。
    今天如果有人搬出这几句话来，作为一种政治主张，那无疑是反动的。但是，在当时的历史条件下，孟子的这几句话，却只不过反映了一种客观存在的事实。孟子认为这种事实是合理的，他用分工的必要来证明这种事实的合理性。孟子的这一套说法是不是错误的呢？应该承认孟子的说法有合理的一面。脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工在历史上的必要性，是马克思主义证明了的。
    当然，这种分工不是从人类社会一开始就有的。在起初，氏族社会的酋长也和其他成员一样从事体力劳动，他并没有完全脱离生产。只在后来，才逐渐出现了完全摆脱体力劳动的统治集团。
    许行这一派人所仰慕的正是阶级出现以前的社会，历史上劳心劳力的分工和阶级的出现都是一种必然的进步的现象，许行的主张，在当时的历史条件下实质上是倒退的。
    但是孟子也把劳心劳力的这种关系美化了，永恒合理化了。在劳心和劳力的分工开始萌芽时，少数管理人的确是在集体的监督下担当某种社会职务，保护全体成员的共同利益。但随着社会的发展，社会职能越来越取得更大的独立性，终于发展为对社会的统治，而社会的公仆也就转化为社会的主人了。在这里不是单纯的劳心劳力的分工关系，同时也是剥削和被剥削的关系。
            ×　×　×
    有的人在他们的文章中说，体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工是永远需要的，理由是只有这种分工才能“发挥人们更大的作用”，“否则就埋没了天才”；另外一方面，在社会主义社会和共产主义社会里，“这种分工是友谊的协作，……并没有高低贵贱之分，在物质及政治待遇上也是完全平等。”
  （魏高）“造成脑力劳动和体力劳动的不平等、不合理的是阶级、是剥削制度、是私有制度。……至于到了共产主义社会，……大家都以社会的工作人员面目出现，因此大家的地位都是平等的。”（徐君正）
    这是说，劳心和劳力的分工是永远有利于生产力发展的，体力劳动者和脑力劳动者的关系的不合理的地方，只在于不平等，只要阶级消灭，两者就平等了，因此也用不着消灭两者的分工了。
    反过来，有的同志也就拿“平等”作为一个尺子，来解释体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工必须马上消灭：
    “我们要消灭的是脑力劳动与体力劳动的分工，消灭社会上一部分人专门从事知识活动，另一部分人专门从事体力劳动的不平等现象，而不是消灭两种劳动形态本身的不同，因为这是不可能消灭的。”（俞长彬）
    请注意，在这里作者认为体力劳动和脑力劳动这两种劳动形态的不同是不能消灭的，因此，他所谓的消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工的根本办法，不是高度发展生产力，实现机械化、电气化、自动化等等（只有在这样的基础上，两种劳动形态的差别才会消灭），而是体力劳动者参加脑力劳动，脑力劳动者参加体力劳动：
      “我们党所提出的干部下放，劳动锻炼；工人参加企业的管理；工厂、人民公社办学校，学校办工厂（农场）；……都是为解决这个问题所采取的重要措施，而使脑力劳动与体力劳动结合起来，从根本上来消灭两者之间的分工。”
  （着重点是我加的）
    孟子从分工的观点把劳心者和劳力者的关系永恒合理化，许行则从平等的观点出发要求废除这种分工关系。现在，有的人也从分工的观点来企图证明脑力劳动者和体力劳动者这两种人的不同会永远存在，而另外又有人从平等的观点来要求马上废除这种分工，并误以为党现在所实行的某些政策就是在消灭这种分工。双方面的共同错误，在于脱离了具体的历史条件。
                        ×　×　×
    其实，分工是历史的范畴，平等也是历史的范畴。
    拿才能的差异来辩护分工的永恒性是讲不通的。劳动人民中决不缺乏科学和艺术的天才，只是他们大部分得不到机会发展罢了。从历史的观点看，社会上各种人的才能的差异并不是分工的原因，倒是分工的结果。人类的自然才能的差异本来不像今天这样大的，只是由于分工越来越细，职业越来越繁复，人的才能才得到千差万别的发展。旧式的固定的分工一方面促进了某些人和某些才能的发展，一方面也限制了另一些人和另一些才能的发展。魏高说，没有分工就会埋没天才，他没有想到，对于大多数劳动人民来说，他们中有许多科学和艺术的天才恰恰是由于旧式的固定的分工而被埋没了。
    支配分工的发展的，不是人的才能的发展，而是生产力的发展。这才是历史唯物主义的观点。
    孟子生在两千多年以前，当然他不会想到将来社会生产力会发展到每个人每天只需要劳动很短的时间，而且一个人在劳力时也必须劳心——运用丰富的科学技术知识。到这样的时候，孟子讲的道理（一定要摆脱生产劳动才能有时间从事精神劳动）就完全失去现实根据了。孟子看不到这一点是不足怪的，但是今天我们应该能够看到，劳心和劳力的分工决不是永远合理的。
    另一种相反的意见：体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工是不合理的，应该毫不犹豫地马上废除它。这里牵涉到一个问题：合理或不合理的标准究竟是什么？
    照有些同志看来，凡是平等的就是合理的，凡是不平等的就是不合理的。
    这种思想方法的错误在哪里呢？错误就在看问题不从物质生活需要出发，从实际历史条件出发，而从抽象的道德观念出发。
    马克思主义和空想社会主义不同，它不仅仅说“应该”消灭资本主义，因为资本主义不人道，“应该”建立社会主义，因为社会主义美好，等等，而是进一步找出资本主义发展的规律，从而指出资本主义“必然”消灭，社会主义“必然”胜利。“应该”或“不应该”不是我们的出发点，我们的出发点是客观的必然规律，我们是根据客观必然规律来决定我们“应该”做什么或“不应该”做什么。
    从原始社会走向阶级社会，这是从平等走向不平等，可是这是人类历史的一个发展，一个进步，因为阶级社会把原始社会的生产力推进了。阶级社会里的不平等现象，在共产主义社会里也要消灭，这也是进步，因为它也有利于生产力的发展。
    所以，根本问题不在平等不平等，而在社会生产力发展的客观需要。如果某种平等是阻碍社会生产力发展的，它就是不合理的，它就会被历史的进一步发展所废除。如果某种不平等是有利于社会生产力发展的，它就会继续存在。
    所谓合理或不合理，是要历史地具体地来看的。“社会关系的每一个发展阶段对于它们的时间和条件来说，都是正当合理的”。（恩格斯：“费尔巴哈和德国古典哲学的终结”）合理就是合乎社会发展规律。体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工，是生产力有所发展，而又不够发展的产物。在这种历史条件下，这种分工的发生和发展也就是合理的。只有生产力高度发展以后才能消灭这种分工。
    尽管解放以来我们的国家有了飞速的进步，但到现在我国还是一个“一穷二白”的国家。“穷”就是经济落后，“白”就是文化落后。能不能让我国工农群众都从事脑力劳动呢？当然不行。如果他们从事体力劳动的时间大大减少了，生活必需品马上就会严重缺乏。而且，他们一般也没有具备足够的文化水平。要在全国人民当中消灭文盲，还要让全体人民学科学，学理论，这就需要相当长的时间。从知识分子方面来看，如果目前就取消劳心劳力的分工，实行许行的主张，叫知识分子自己种地来养活自己，那么，文化科学的发展就会停顿下来，当然也直接间接地造成生产上的混乱。所以，要求马上废除体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工，就是企图跳越历史发展进程，结果只会造成生产力倒退。这就是说，体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工在现阶段是必要的，合理的。
    当然，绝对合理的事物是没有的。这里又用得着恩格斯的话：“凡人类历史领域内的一切现实的东西，随着时间的推移，都会变成不合理的东西，因而它按其本性就已是不合理的，老早就包含着不合理性。”（“费尔巴哈和德国古典哲学的终结”）体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工，究竟限制了人的全面发展，使人终身束缚在一种固定的职业上，因而在某些方面也妨碍生产力发展。所以，这种分工也包含着不合理的成份。在现阶段，这种不合理的成份还不是主要的方面，但在将来，这种分工会越来越失去其合理性，越来越暴露其不合理性。所以，我们现在就要积极准备条件，以便在将来时机成熟时逐步消灭这种分工。
    永远保持体力劳动和脑力劳动的分工的想法是错误的，这种分工在将来一定要消灭。——这是这个问题上的不断革命论。企图在现阶段消灭这种分工的想法也是错误的，这种分工在目前还有必要保持。——这是这个问题上的革命发展阶段论。
                      ×　×　×
    目前知识分子参加劳动，工人参加生产管理等等，是不是“体力劳动和脑力劳动的结合”呢？应该说：大部分不是。
    应该承认这样的事实：一个知识分子参加挑土，送肥，挖地等等农业劳动时，虽然也可以学习到一些很有用的知识，但在这种劳动中，并不是时时刻刻需要动脑筋的。实际上他的时间是分为两部分：在他本身的工作里，他是劳心者而不是劳力者；在他参加体力劳动的时间里，他暂时变成一个劳力者而不是劳心者。体力劳动和脑力劳动只是相互交替，并没有融合在一起。但是如果我们的农业实现了高度机械化，电气化，自动化，那就不同了。从事这种农业劳动，没有相当丰富的科学知识是根本不行的。你很难说那时的农民究竟是劳力者还是劳心者。
    干部种试验田，学校实行教育和劳动生产结合，在这里劳心和劳力的确有某种程度的结合，但不是完全的结合。在将来的共产主义社会里，脑力劳动和体力劳动这两种劳动形态的差别消失了，那才是完全的结合。
    党在目前实行干部下放，工人参加生产管理等等政策，是要消除知识分子和工农群众的隔阂，为将来的消灭两种分工开辟道路。这种政策是完全必要的。但是，如果以为这就是在向共产主义过渡，以为共产主义社会的劳动者也是像现在这样以一部分时间从事单纯体力劳动，另一部分时间从事单纯脑力劳动，那就是把共产主义的理想降低了。
    企图现在叫每一个人都同样地均等地以一部分时间从事脑力劳动，另一部分时间参加体力劳动，以为这才是平等，这实际上是一种平均主义的思想。通常平均主义是表现在消费问题上的，这里我们看到了平均主义思想在生产劳动方面也有它的表现。
    体力劳动者和脑力劳动者这两种人在目前是可以结合的，这种结合也就是我们常说的“知识分子和工农群众的结合”。至于要实现体力劳动者和脑力劳动者的完全“平等”，办法不是互相拉平，而是大大发展生产力，开展文化技术革命。到了体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别消灭的时候，体力劳动者和脑力劳动者的差别也消灭了。
