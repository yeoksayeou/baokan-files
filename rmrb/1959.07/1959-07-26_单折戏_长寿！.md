"One-Act Plays" Live Long!
    Qin Li

    The one-act play exhibition and performance held in Beijing is a great thing!

    One-act plays are like short stories in literature. After watching many large-scale "masterpieces," people really need these short and concise pieces. These one-act plays each have their own vivid plots. Some are extracted from full-length plays, but they can stand alone, having complete structures. Moreover, one-act plays include both civil and martial dramas, and it's not difficult to find roles for all character types: *sheng*, *dan*, *jing*, *mo*, and *chou*. Audiences have always welcomed one-act plays.

    Precisely because they are short, one-act plays are more condensed, more focused, and can more easily move the audience, achieving a stronger effect. Some one-act play repertoire has stood the test of time. For example, who doesn't love to watch "Little Cowherd" filled with pastoral scenery? Who doesn't love to watch "Stealing the Imperial Horse," which showcases the heroic character of those in the green forests? Who doesn't love to watch "Autumn River" filled with poetic and picturesque imagery?

    However, in recent years, it seems that one-act plays have not been performed as much. This time, some of Beijing's major troupes and so many famous actors are participating in the one-act play exhibition and performance, which shows that everyone is beginning to pay attention to one-act plays. Facts prove that audiences love one-act plays.

    For the longevity of one-act plays, we ask the troupes to include these programs in their daily performances after the exhibition. In addition, there are many good one-act plays in local operas, but unfortunately, it seems that attention is still focused on sorting out and adapting large-scale full-length plays. We hope that while sorting out large-scale full-length plays, all localities will also take one-act plays into consideration!

### “单折戏”长寿！

    “单折戏”长寿！
    秦犁
    北京市举办的单折戏展览演出，是件好事情！
    单折戏就像是文学作品里的短篇小说一样，人们在看多了成本大套的“巨著”以后，确实是需要这些短小精炼的短篇的。这些单折戏都各有其生动的情节，有的虽说是从本戏中抽出来的一折，但可以独立成章，有其完整的结构，而且在单折戏中文戏武戏全有，也不难找到生旦净末丑角色，观众是一向欢迎单折戏的。
    也正因其短小，所以单折戏就更凝炼、更集中，也更能感染观众，收到强烈的效果。有些单折戏剧目是久经考验了的。例如谁不爱看充满了田园风光的“小放牛”，谁不爱看表现绿林中英雄性格的“盗御马”，谁不爱看充满了诗情画意的“秋江”？
    但是，近年来，单折戏好像演得不多了。这一次，北京的一些主要剧团和这么多名演员都参加单折戏的展览演出，说明大家开始重视单折戏了，事实证明，观众是喜爱单折戏的。
    为了单折戏的永生，我们要求剧团在展览过后，把这些节目安排在日常的演出中。另外，各地方戏曲中好的单折戏也不少，可惜到目前为止，好像注意力还只偏重于整理改编大部头的本戏，希望各地在整理大部头本戏的同时，也要兼顾一下单折戏！
