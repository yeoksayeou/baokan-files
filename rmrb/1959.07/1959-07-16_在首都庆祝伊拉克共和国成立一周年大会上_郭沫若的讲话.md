    Speech by Guo Moruo at the Capital's Celebration of the First Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of Iraq

    To His Excellency Aziz Sharif, Special Representative of the Republic of Iraq, Comrades, Friends:
    Today, people from all walks of life in the capital of our People's Republic of China are gathering here with great pleasure and excitement to hold a grand meeting to celebrate the glorious festival of the July 14th Revolution and the first anniversary of the birth of the Republic of Iraq. First of all, on behalf of the entire Chinese people, I would like to express my welcome to His Excellency Aziz Sharif, Special Representative of the Republic of Iraq, and extend my warmest congratulations and sincerest respect to the heroic Iraqi people and the government of the Republic of Iraq!
    After nearly forty years of arduous revolutionary struggle, the heroic Iraqi people finally, on July 14th of last year, with the force of a thunderbolt, destroyed the reactionary rule of imperialism and its agent, the Faisal dynasty, established the Republic of Iraq, and achieved a great victory in the national revolution. This great victory of the Iraqi people not only opened a new page in the history of Iraq but also has significant international implications. Your victory broke the backbone of the Baghdad Pact, paralyzing it and dealing a fatal blow to the imperialist aggression front and war plan that had been laid out in the Middle East for a long time. Your victory has also brought tremendous encouragement to all Arab people, as well as the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The great victory of the Iraqi people once again proves that as long as the people of oppressed countries unite and persist in their struggle, imperialism can be completely defeated.
    Over the past year, under the leadership of Prime Minister Qasim, the people of the Republic of Iraq have achieved a series of major victories in the struggle to consolidate national independence. The Iraqi people have repeatedly crushed the subversive conspiracies plotted by imperialism and defended their national independence. The Republic of Iraq has pursued a foreign policy of opposing imperialism and adhering to peaceful neutrality, withdrawing from the Baghdad Pact organization, rejecting the Eisenhower Doctrine, abolishing the U.S.-Iraq military assistance agreement, and canceling the British military base in Iraq, thereby further shaking off the control and shackles of imperialism. On the other hand, the government of the Republic of Iraq has also strengthened friendly ties with socialist countries and all peace-loving countries. At the same time, the national economy of the Republic of Iraq has also achieved some development. This series of great achievements of the Iraqi people has had a profound and positive impact on the anti-colonialist struggles of countries and peoples still under imperialist rule. We are pleased to see that in the past year, the national revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have continued to rise, and the imperialist colonial system is further shaking and disintegrating. We firmly believe that in the situation where "the East wind prevails over the West wind," as long as the socialist forces, peace forces, and national independence forces of the world continue to strengthen unity and persist in struggle, the day of the final defeat of imperialism is not far away.
    The Iraqi revolution was an extremely heavy blow to imperialist rule in the entire Middle East. Therefore, from the very first day of the Republic of Iraq's birth, imperialism regarded it as a thorn in its side and has never stopped its subversive and destructive activities against it. At the beginning, they attempted to carry out direct armed intervention against it, but their plan was thwarted by the resolute opposition of the Iraqi people and the peace-loving people of all countries around the world who oppose imperialism. After that, they attempted to instigate Iraq's counter-revolutionary forces to subvert the young republic from within, but these conspiracies have also been repeatedly defeated due to the Iraqi people and government's close unity and resolute defense of their national independence. In recent times, imperialism has been carrying out more vicious and deceptive aggressive activities against Iraq and various Arab countries. While continuing to plot subversive activities against these countries, it is deepening political division and economic penetration, alienating these countries from socialist countries, undermining the unity among these countries, and undermining the internal unity of the people of these countries, attempting to achieve the goal of defeating them one by one and making a comeback. However, the Chinese people are fully confident that the awakened Iraqi and Arab peoples will be able to maintain vigilance at all times, see through this new conspiracy of the imperialists, and completely smash it.
    The Chinese people have also suffered from imperialist aggression for a long time in the past, so there is a natural feeling of shared destiny between the people of our two countries. The Chinese people and the Iraqi people, as well as the entire Arab people, have always supported each other in the struggle against imperialism. The Chinese people have always regarded the victory of the Iraqi people as their own victory, because your victory is a great support for our peaceful construction, and it also increases the guarantee for the cause of world peace for the people of all countries. I also remember very clearly that a year ago today, we and more than 1,200 representatives from more than 70 countries and regions were preparing for the opening of the "Conference on Disarmament and International Cooperation" in the capital of Sweden in two days. The news of the success of the Iraqi revolution suddenly came like the awakening of hibernating creatures by spring thunder, which made all the representatives present rejoice and was unanimously passed on the opening day of the conference. The resolution demanded that the U.S. troops withdraw from Lebanon, the British troops withdraw from Jordan, and no interference be allowed in the Iraqi revolution. This vividly proves that the victory of the Iraqi people is also the common victory of the people of all countries in the world. Therefore, our government, together with other peace-loving countries, announced the recognition of the Republic of Iraq on the third day after the founding of the Republic of Iraq, that is, on the second day when the American aggressors landed in Lebanon and pointed their bayonets at the newborn Republic of Iraq. After that, the people of our country continued to launch a vigorous movement to protest against imperialist aggression against Iraq, demanding that the U.S. and British aggressor troops withdraw from the Middle East and stop the conspiracy to interfere in Iraq. Over the past year, the Chinese people have always been concerned with sympathy for every revolutionary struggle of the Iraqi people, and have been happy and encouraged by every victory and every achievement you have made. It is certain that the just struggle of the Iraqi people against imperialism and for the maintenance of national independence will always receive the heartfelt sympathy and firm support of the Chinese people.
    The friendship between the people of China and Iraq has a long history. Both China and Iraq are countries with a long cultural history and have made brilliant contributions to world culture. According to clear historical records, maritime communication and trade between the two countries began as early as the fifth century AD. Between the seventh and thirteenth centuries AD, the two countries had very frequent political, economic, and cultural exchanges. During this period, envoys between the two countries traveled back and forth, and officials followed one another. Travelers and merchants were constantly on the move. This relationship was interrupted only after the forces of imperialism invaded Eastern countries. Now, with the liberation and independence of our two great nations, the friendly relations between the two countries have been restored and have developed on a new basis. In the past year, our two countries have successively signed trade agreements and cultural agreements, sent various delegations to each other, and held art exhibitions. At present, while we are honored to receive His Excellency Aziz Sharif, the government delegation of our country and the song and dance troupe of our country are also in Iraq, celebrating the festival of the Iraqi people's victory together with the Iraqi people. These friendly contacts should be said to be only the beginning of the further development of new political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the two countries. We firmly believe that the friendly relations between China and Iraq will continue to develop and strengthen on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit. The people of China and Iraq will always work together in the common cause of opposing colonialism and safeguarding world peace. The deep friendship between the people of China and Iraq will flow forward forever like the Yangtze River and the Tigris River!
    Long live the Republic of Iraq!
    Long live the heroic Iraqi people!
    Long live the friendship between the people of China and Iraq!
    Long live the great unity of the Asian and African peoples!
    Long live world peace!

    在首都庆祝伊拉克共和国成立一周年大会上
    郭沫若的讲话
    新华社15日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在首都各界人民庆祝伊拉克共和国成立一周年大会上的讲话，全文如下：伊拉克共和国特别代表阿齐兹·谢里夫先生阁下，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们中华人民共和国首都的各界人民，以十分愉快和兴奋的心情，在这里举行盛大的集会，来庆祝伊拉克人民7月14日革命和伊拉克共和国诞生一周年的光辉节日。首先，我代表全体中国人民向伊拉克共和国的特别代表阿齐兹·谢里夫先生表示欢迎，向英勇的伊拉克人民和伊拉克共和国政府表示最热烈的祝贺和最诚挚的敬意！
    英勇的伊拉克人民经过了近四十年的艰苦革命斗争，终于在去年7月14日以摧枯拉朽之势摧毁了帝国主义及其代理人费萨尔王朝的反动统治，建立了伊拉克共和国，取得了民族革命的伟大胜利。伊拉克人民的这一伟大胜利，不仅给伊拉克的历史揭开了新的一页，而且具有重大的国际意义。你们的胜利打断了巴格达条约的脊椎骨，使巴格达条约陷于瘫痪，给予了帝国主义长期在中东布置的侵略阵线和战争计划一个致命的打击。你们的胜利也给全体阿拉伯人民，以及亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民带来了巨大的鼓舞。伊拉克人民的伟大胜利再一次证明了，只要被压迫国家的人民团结一致，坚持斗争，帝国主义是完全可以战胜的。
    一年以来，伊拉克共和国人民在卡塞姆总理的领导下，在巩固民族独立的斗争中取得了一系列的重大胜利。伊拉克人民接二连三地粉碎了帝国主义所策划的颠复阴谋，捍卫了自己的民族独立。伊拉克共和国对外奉行了反对帝国主义和坚持和平中立的政策，退出了巴格达条约组织，拒绝了艾森豪威尔主义，废除了美、伊军事援助协定，并且取消了英国在伊拉克的军事基地，从而进一步摆脱了帝国主义的控制和束缚。另一方面，伊拉克共和国政府也加强了同社会主义国家和一切爱好和平的国家之间的友好联系。与此同时，伊拉克共和国的民族经济也有了一定的发展。伊拉克人民所取得的这一系列的巨大成就，对于还处在帝国主义统治下的国家和人民的反殖民主义斗争，产生了深远的积极的影响。我们高兴地看到，一年来亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族革命运动正在继续高涨，帝国主义的殖民体系正在进一步动摇和瓦解。我们坚决相信：在“东风压倒西风”的形势下，只要全世界的社会主义力量，和平力量和民族独立力量继续加强团结，坚持斗争，帝国主义最后失败的日子是不会很远了。
    伊拉克的革命，对于帝国主义在整个中东地区的统治，是一个极其沉重的打击。因而从伊拉克共和国诞生的第一天起，帝国主义就把它视为眼中钉，从来没有停止过对它的阴谋颠复和破坏活动。在一开始的时候，它们企图对它进行直接的武装干涉，但在伊拉克人民和爱好和平、反对帝国主义的全世界各国人民坚决反对之下，它们的计划被粉碎了。其后，它们又妄图策动伊拉克的反革命势力从内部对年轻的共和国进行颠复，而这些阴谋也由于伊拉克人民和政府紧密团结一致，坚决保卫自己的民族独立，而连续遭到失败。最近一个时期以来，帝国主义对伊拉克和各阿拉伯国家正在进行着更加毒辣和更富于欺骗性的侵略活动。在对这些国家继续策划颠复活动的同时，正在对它们加深进行政治分化和经济渗透，离间这些国家同社会主义国家的关系，破坏这些国家彼此之间的团结，破坏这些国家人民内部的团结，妄图达到各个击破、卷土重来的目的。但是，中国人民完全相信，已经觉醒了的伊拉克和阿拉伯各国人民，一定能够随时保持警惕，洞察帝国主义者这一新的阴谋诡计，把它彻底粉碎。
    中国人民过去也曾经长期遭受到帝国主义的侵略，因而我们两国人民之间也就自然地产生着休戚相关的感情。中国人民和伊拉克人民以及整个阿拉伯人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中，从来就是相互支持的。中国人民一向把伊拉克人民的胜利看作是自己的胜利，因为你们的胜利对我们的和平建设是莫大的支持，使世界各国人民维护世界和平事业也增加了保障。我还记得很清楚，一年前的今天，我们和七十多个国家和地区的一千二百多位代表正在瑞典的首都准备着“裁军和国际合作大会”在两天后的开幕，伊拉克革命成功的消息像春雷启蛰一样突然传来，使全体到会的代表都欢欣鼓舞，在大会开幕的一天便全场一致地通过了决议：要求美国军队撤出黎巴嫩，英国军队撤出约旦，不准对伊拉克的革命进行干涉。这就活鲜鲜地证明：伊拉克人民的胜利同时也就是世界各国人民的共同胜利。因此，我国政府和其他爱好和平的国家一起，在伊拉克共和国成立的第三天，也就是正当美国侵略者在黎巴嫩登陆，把刺刀指向新生的伊拉克共和国的第二天，宣布了承认伊拉克共和国。在这以后，我国人民还继续展开了声势浩大的抗议帝国主义侵略伊拉克的运动，要求美英侵略军撤出中东，停止干涉伊拉克的阴谋。一年来，中国人民始终以同情的心情关怀着伊拉克人民的每一个革命斗争，并且为你们的每一个胜利和每一项成就而感到欢欣鼓舞。可以肯定，伊拉克人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立的正义斗争，将会永远得到中国人民的衷心同情和坚决支持。
    中伊两国人民之间的友谊，是源远流长的，中伊两国都是具有悠久文化历史的国家，都是对世界文化有过光辉贡献的国家。根据明确的历史记载，早在公元五世纪的时候，两国之间就已开始了海上的交通和贸易往来。在公元七世纪至十三世纪之间，两国之间的政治、经济和文化都曾经有过十分频繁的交往。这期间两国间使节往还，冠盖相望；行旅客商，不绝于途。在帝国主义势力侵入东方各国之后，这种关系才被中断了。现在，随着我们两个伟大民族的解放和独立，两国间的友好关系又在新的基础上得到恢复并且有了新的发展。一年来，我们两国先后签订了贸易协定和文化协定，相互派遣了各种代表团，并且举办了艺术展览。目前，在我们荣幸地接待阿齐兹·谢里夫先生阁下的同时，我国政府代表团和我国的歌舞团也正在伊拉克同伊拉克人民一起欢度伊拉克人民胜利的节日。这些友好联系应该说还只是两国之间新的政治、经济和文化合作关系进一步发展的开端。我们深信，中伊两国的友好关系在和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的基础上，必将继续得到发展和加强。中伊两国人民在反对殖民主义和维护世界和平的共同事业中，必将永远携手前进。中伊两国人民之间的深厚友谊，将像长江和底格里斯河一样，永远奔流前进！
    伊拉克共和国万岁！
    英勇的伊拉克人民万岁！
    中伊两国人民的友谊万岁！
    亚非人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
