    On the Fengsha Railway Line
    Ding Li
      Across the mountains, the Fengsha Railway Line has sixty-five tunnels, the train is a long dragon that loves to drill through tunnels.
    We are in the belly of the long dragon, like a coxswain rowing a dragon boat.
    No! Like piloting a speedboat, sailing in the belly of the mountains.
    Outside the window, it's pitch black, like a dark sea, inside the window hangs the moon, round and bright.
    Every time I come out of a tunnel, I sing, with precipitous cliffs flying past my eyes, what beautiful orchards and wheat fields!
    What beautiful, embroidered mountains and rivers!
    Every time I enter a tunnel, I think: We can not only pierce through the belly of the mountains, and not only let trains fly across the Yangtze River, but in the future, we will also make it pass through the seabed.
    
    Yongding River
    The Yongding River was originally named the Wuding River, running east and west, often causing disasters, like a wild horse without reins, galloping across the North China mountains and plains.
    In the past, the water that flowed was too muddy, almost like mud; now the water that flows is clear, better than jade nectar, and the land loves to drink it.
    The jade nectar crashes on the rocks, splashing up waves like white cranes, white cranes fly into the rice fields in flocks, white cranes fly down the slopes in flocks.
    Why is it so clear? So white? Because Guanting installed a lock, locking the water in the reservoir, clarifying it, and then giving it to everyone.

    Guanting Reservoir
    The water of Guanting Lake is like white clouds, a horizontal stretch of white clouds below the mountains, the white clouds are vast like lake water, it is difficult to distinguish between the white clouds and the lake water.
    The lakeside has become a good pasture, the shepherdess waves her whip and sings, the lake water is clear, the shore grass is green, and the flocks of sheep roll like white waves.
    Although the lake body is long with many bays, every bay has fishing boats.
    The old city of Huailai is submerged at the bottom of the lake, and tourists point and talk about the past.
    It surpasses the Jade Pool storing jade dew, and can irrigate tens of millions of acres of fertile land.
    Pumping stations are set up on the shore to make the lake water flow towards the sky.

    丰沙线上

      过山洞丰沙线有六十五个山洞，列车是爱钻山洞的长龙。我们在长龙的肚皮里，好像是划龙舟的梢公。不！像是驾着一艘快艇，在大山的肚皮里航行。窗外漆黑，茫如夜海，窗内挂着月亮，又圆又明。每出一个山洞我就唱歌，悬岩绝壁在眼前飞过，多么美丽的果林麦田！多么美丽的锦绣山河！每进一个山洞我就想起：我们不仅能穿山的肚皮，不仅能让火车飞过长江，将来还要它通过海底。永定河永定河原名无定河，东奔西窜，多不听说，好似一匹无缰野马，在华北山地平原上奔波。从前流的水太浑浊，简直和泥浆差不多；如今流的是清水，胜过玉液，土地爱喝。玉液撞在岩石上，溅起浪花好像白鹤，白鹤成群飞进稻田，白鹤成群飞下山坡。为啥这么清？这么白？因为官厅安了锁钥，把水锁在水库里，澄清以后，再给大伙。官厅水库官厅湖水如白云，山下一片白云横，白云茫茫似湖水，白云湖水难分清。湖边变成好牧场，牧羊女儿挥鞭唱，湖水清，岸草绿，羊群滚滚如白浪。湖身虽长许多湾，湾湾都有打鱼船。怀来旧城沉湖底，游人指点说从前。胜过瑶池储玉露，能灌良田千万丘。岸边设起扬水站，要叫湖水朝天流。
