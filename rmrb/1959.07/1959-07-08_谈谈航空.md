Talking About Aviation
　　Wang Junkui
　　
The development of aviation science and technology is the culmination of the latest achievements in modern science.

　　It has only been seventy-seven years since the great Russian inventor Mozhaisky created the first aircraft in 1882. In this short period, through the efforts of designers, manufacturers, and scientists from all over the world, aviation science and technology has seen rapid development and astonishing achievements. Today, almost all cutting-edge achievements in various sciences and technologies are related to aviation science and technology. For example, the utilization of atomic energy, semiconductor technology, jet technology, high-temperature resistant structures, high-energy fuels, radio technology, electronics, electronic computers, radar, television, automation technology, and remote control mechanics are all directly or indirectly applied to aircraft, or more broadly, to flying vehicles. Because flying vehicles include not only airplanes but also rockets, spacecraft, artificial satellites, intercontinental missiles, and other things that can fly. Therefore, we can say that the achievements of flying vehicles are the culmination of the latest achievements in various modern sciences and technologies. Without these latest achievements, the launch of the Soviet Union's cosmic rocket would not be possible, and even the manufacturing of supersonic aircraft would be unattainable. We know that the fastest speed of a car is only about 100 kilometers per hour, while the flight speed of the Soviet Union's Tu-114D giant airliner can exceed 900 kilometers per hour. Some experimental aircraft in the world have reached speeds of more than 4,000 kilometers per hour. As for the speed of rockets, it is even faster. The speed of the cosmic rocket launched by the Soviet Union on January 2 this year was 11.2 kilometers per second. If calculated in hours, its speed reached more than 40,000 kilometers per hour. A fully loaded car weighs at most about ten tons. Now some heavy long-range bombers can reach a total weight of more than 180 tons. The structure of the cosmic rocket launched by the Soviet Union is made of lightweight and high-strength materials. The fuel it carries is also a high-energy compound. Despite this, it is estimated that the total take-off weight of this rocket is at least over 1,000 tons. The distance that flying vehicles can fly is also astonishingly great. Large bombers can fly back and forth for more than 10,000 kilometers in one go. As for cosmic rockets, the flight distance is not tens of thousands of kilometers, but billions of kilometers.
　　
The various components of a flying vehicle are equivalent to the various organs of the human body.

　　At present, flying vehicles have become one of the most advanced machines. Its components can be compared to the various organs of the human body. It has a body, a nervous system, a heart, and a digestive system, etc.

　　When people see an airplane, they first notice its fuselage, wings, tail, landing gear, etc. These are its body and limbs. The design of these components must be light yet strong, resistant to cold and heat, and resistant to external pressure. The impact of temperature is not significant during subsonic flight. However, if the flight speed is twice the speed of sound, the temperature of the front skin of the aircraft can reach 100℃. If it is five times the speed of sound, the temperature can reach above 900℃. If a rocket returns to Earth from the moon and re-enters the atmosphere at a speed of 24,000 kilometers per hour, or even higher, the temperature of the front end can reach above 10,000℃. Therefore, structural design largely determines the performance of the flying vehicle. The solution to structural problems should start from two aspects: (1) Seeking new materials. (2) Improving the research level of structural mechanics. Titanium alloys, metal ceramics, plastics, and other high-temperature and high-strength materials are the direction of today's material research. At the same time, the structural design must solve a series of strength problems. For example, thermal stress, thermal buckling, fatigue strength, and flutter are all important topics in structural mechanics research.

　　Choosing the shape of the flying vehicle and the arrangement of its components is another important issue. The aesthetic appeal of the appearance should certainly be considered, but more important is its tactical flight performance and safety performance under various allowable flight conditions. Since the advent of high-speed flying vehicles, a series of new requirements have been put forward for its aerodynamic shape, maneuverability, and stability.

　　The engine is the heart and digestive system of the aircraft. Because it continues to work, its performance is required to be reliable, lightweight, and powerful. With the rapid progress of the aviation industry, new types of engines are constantly emerging. In the early twentieth century, piston engines appeared in the world. At the end of World War II, turbojet and ramjet engines appeared. More importantly, the birth of the rocket engine. It is precisely because of it that space travel has become possible, because it carries its own fuel and combustion-supporting oxidizer, and the thrust is also very large. However, in order to achieve greater horsepower, lighter weight, longer flight time, and longer range, people are seeking newer engines. It is estimated that atomic engines will soon be born. Many people are also researching photon rockets and ion rockets, among other engines.

　　The development of modern flying vehicles not only needs to meet the requirements of high speed and high altitude performance, but also needs to meet important conditions such as flight stability and accurate measurement. In addition, it is necessary to find ways to reduce the arduous burden on pilots during long-term flights, and to find ways to undertake those control tasks that pilots find difficult to handle due to excessive operating speeds. Due to the rapid development of various sciences today, it is possible to complete the operation tasks of flying vehicles completely with automatic control and remote control systems under various complex flight conditions and weather changes. Automatic control and telemetry systems are equivalent to the human body's nervous system and the ability to perform muscle movements. They can identify various flight conditions and air conditions around the flying vehicle, even thousands of kilometers away, and accurately guide airplanes, rockets, missiles, etc. to work according to the flight plan. In particular, after modern radar and television have been widely applied to aviation, remote control and telemetry systems have become richer and more versatile. Automatic control systems have become even more important since the birth of artificial satellites, intercontinental missiles, and cosmic rockets. For example, in August 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first intercontinental missile rocket, which had a range of 8,000 kilometers and an error of only 0.1% to 0.25%. This is the role played by the automatic control system. Due to the different methods of measuring the flight direction of the flying vehicle and the deviation values of the trajectory or plan, automatic control systems are divided into three types: gyro-based, inertial-based, and astronomical navigation-based. The gyro system is similar to the autopilot used in ordinary airplanes, and the main measuring instrument is the gyroscope, while the main measuring instrument of the inertial system is the accelerometer. The automatic control system uses the signals from these measuring instruments as the basis for issuing commands. The method of the astronomical navigation system lies in using special equipment on the flying vehicle to determine the changing patterns of the direction of two bright stars in the sky, thereby forming a command signal for navigation. Here, we must not forget the electronic computer of the control system. It actually plays the role of the human brain. It has a memory device to memorize the instructions and original data of the flight plan. It also has an arithmetic unit for arithmetic and logical operations, and then outputs the calculation results as signals. Therefore, it has become the nerve center of the automatic control system.

　　It should be pointed out that humans are not machines, and machines are by no means humans. The use of humans as an analogy here is partly for ease of understanding and partly to imagine how flying vehicles are developing to a high degree.

      Breaking through numerous barriers such as the "sound barrier" and the "heat barrier" to move towards higher speeds.

　　"Mankind will not live on Earth forever. In order to find light and space, they will gradually fly out of the outer layer of the atmosphere and finally conquer the entire solar system." The ideal of Tsiolkovsky, the great founder of interstellar navigation, is turning into action. Today, people are making various preparations: explorers want to fly high and make mankind's boldest discoveries; mining and metallurgy people want to extract rare elements from other planets that do not exist on Earth; biologists want to study whether there are plants and animals outside the Earth, and whether there are rational higher animals living; historians and geographers also want to understand the situation outside the Earth and compile cosmic geography and cosmic development history, and so on. In short, the development of aviation is already standing at the forefront of the rapid development of world science and technology, and the secrets of the universe will be revealed by the achievements of cosmic rocket technology.

　　When people were able to manufacture airplanes, they began to pursue higher speeds and encountered various difficulties at the same time. When the flight speed increased to near the speed of sound, the so-called "sound barrier" problem was encountered first, because when reaching such a high speed, the airflow in front of the aircraft wing formed a shock wave, which greatly increased the resistance to forward flight. After more than 20 years of efforts in aerodynamics and rocket engines, the sound barrier problem has finally been solved. It can be said that the aircraft has overcome this obstacle in its development.

　　When the flight speed is more than 2.5 times the speed of sound, the so-called "heat barrier" problem is encountered again. In this case, the temperature in the air boundary layer around the wing or aircraft suddenly increases to hundreds of degrees, which causes a sharp change in the skin temperature and produces serious problems of structural thermal stress and instability failure. This heat barrier is still being gradually solved.

　　When flying into high altitude, the air is thin and the horsepower must be large. This barrier cannot be overcome with a piston engine. Since the rocket engine was made, this struggle has won another victory. The rocket itself carries all the necessary fuel and the oxidizer necessary to support combustion, so it does not need any external air. On the contrary, the more rarefied the air, the higher the efficiency of the engine. Another feature of the rocket is that it can burn a large amount of fuel into gas in tens of seconds or minutes and eject it at a very high speed, thereby generating a very large thrust.

　　Only after the aircraft reaches the three critical cosmic speeds can interstellar travel become possible. The Soviet Union's successful launch of artificial satellites and cosmic rockets shows that it has successfully achieved the first cosmic speed (8 kilometers per second) and the second cosmic speed (11.2 kilometers per second). To further develop space travel, it is necessary to move towards the path of the largest possible effective payload and the largest possible speed. The attainment of this expected victory first requires further improvement and development of rocket engines. Whether these engines are atomic rockets, ion rockets, photon rockets, or something else, remains to be solved by the further development of science and technology.

    谈谈航空
  　王俊奎
    航空科学技术的发展是现代科学最新成就的结晶
    自从俄国伟大发明家莫查依斯基在1882年创制了第一架飞机以后，迄今不过七十七年之久。在这短短的时期内，通过世界各国的设计制造家和科学家们的努力，航空科学技术有着迅速的发展和惊人的成就。到今天，各种科学技术上的最尖端的成就，几乎都同航空科学技术有关。如原子能利用、半导体技术、喷气技术、耐高温结构、高能燃料、无线电技术、电子学、电子计算机、雷达、电视、自动化技术和遥控力学等，都是直接间接地应用到飞机上，广义的说法该是应用到飞行器上。因为飞行器不仅包括飞机，还包括火箭、飞船、人造卫星、洲际导弹等能够飞行的东西。因此我们可以说飞行器的成就是现代各种科学技术最新成就的结晶。没有这些最新的成就，不但苏联宇宙火箭的发射不可能，就是超音速飞机的制造也办不到。我们知道，汽车的速度最快不过每小时一百公里，而苏联图114Д巨型旅客机的飞行速度就可以超过每小时九百公里。世界上有些试验性飞机，每小时飞行速度已经达到四千公里以上。至于火箭的速度那就更快了。苏联今年1月2日发射的宇宙火箭的速度是每秒钟十一点二公里，如果用小时来计算，它的速度达到每小时四万多公里。汽车满载，最多也不过十吨左右。现在有的重型远程轰炸机总重量可以达到一百八十余吨。苏联发射的宇宙火箭，它的结构是用重量轻、强度高的材料制造的。所载的燃料又是高能化合物。尽管如此，据估计这火箭的起飞总重量最低仍有一千吨以上。飞行器所能飞行的距离也是大得惊人。大的轰炸机可以一口气往返飞行一万公里以上。至于宇宙火箭，那么飞行的距离不是几万公里，而是多少亿公里了。
    飞行器的各个组成部分  相当于人体的各个器官
    目前，飞行器已经是一种最先进的机器。它的组成部分可以和人体的各个器官相比拟。它有身躯，有神经系统，有心脏，还有消化系统等。
    大家看到飞机后，首先就注意到它的机身、机翼、尾翼、起落架等，这就是它的躯体和四肢。这些部件的设计既要轻，又要结实，不怕冷不怕热，又不怕外部的压力。在亚音速飞行时，温度的影响还不大。如果飞行速度是音速的二倍时，飞机前部蒙皮的温度可以达到100℃。如果是音速的五倍时，其温度可以达到900℃以上。如果火箭由月球返回地球重入大气层的速度为二万四千公里时，或更高的速度，那么前端部的温度可以达到10，000℃以上。因此结构设计在很大程度上决定着飞行器的性能。解决结构的办法，应该由两方面入手：（1）寻求新的材料。（2）提高结构力学的研究水平。钛合金、金属陶瓷、塑料等耐高温高强度的材料都是今天材料研究的方向。同时结构的设计又必须解决一系列的强度问题。例如热应力、热皱损、疲劳强度、颤振等都是结构力学研究的重要课题。
    选择飞行器的外形，以及各部件的安排又是另外一个重要问题。外形的美观当然应该注意到，但是更重要的是它的战术飞行性能，以及各种允许飞行状态下的安全性能。自从高速飞行器出世以后，对它的气动力外形，操纵性以及稳定性等就提出了一系列新的要求。
    发动机是飞机的心脏和消化系统。由于它继续不断地进行工作，因此就要求它的性能可靠，重量轻而马力大。随着航空事业一日千里的进展，新型的发动机也在经常出现。二十世纪初，世界上才出现了活塞式发动机，第二次世界大战末期，又出现了涡轮喷气式和冲压喷气式发动机。更重要的是火箭发动机的诞生。正是因为有了它，宇宙航行才变为可能，因为它本身携带燃料和助燃的氧化剂，并且推力也很大。但是为了马力更大，重量更轻，飞行时间更长，航程更远，人们正在寻求更新的发动机。估计原子发动机不久就要诞生。还有不少的人正在研究光子火箭，以及离子火箭等发动机。
    现代飞行器的发展，不仅需要满足高速、高空性能的要求，还须满足飞行稳定、测量准确等等重要条件。此外，还要设法减轻飞行员在长时间航行的艰苦负担，以及设法担负起那些由于操作过速而使飞行员难以胜任的操纵工作。由于今天各门科学的飞跃发展，已有可能在各种复杂的飞行状态和气象变化的情形下，把飞行器的操作任务完全用自动控制和远距离操纵系统来完成。自动控制和遥控遥测系统的设备相当于人体上的神经系统和肌肉动作的本领。它们能判明飞行器周围，甚至远在数千公里以外的各种飞行情况和空中条件，并能准确地引导飞机、火箭、导弹等按照飞行方案来进行工作。特别是现代的雷达和电视被航空广泛地应用后，遥控遥测系统变得更为丰富和多能。自动控制系统在人造卫星、洲际导弹和宇宙火箭诞生以后，更显得无比重要。比如1957年8月，苏联发射出第一颗洲际导弹火箭，其射程有八千公里远，而误差仅在0.1％到0.25％以内。这就是自动控制系统所起的作用。由于对飞行器的飞行方向及对弹道或方案的偏差数值测量方法的不同，自动控制系统分为陀螺式的、惯性式的和天文导航式的三种。陀螺系统与普通飞机所用的自动驾驶仪相似，主要测量器是陀螺仪，而惯性系统的主要测量器则是加速表。自动控制系统按照这些测量器的信号作为发号施令的依据。天文导航系统的方法在于利用飞行器上的专门设备去测定空中两颗明亮星球的方向变化规律，因之形成指挥信号来导航。这里，我们还不要忘记控制系统的电子计算机。它实际起着人的大脑的作用。它有记忆装置，用以记忆飞行方案的指令和原始数据。它又有运算装置，作为算术运算和逻辑运算之用，然后将计算结果输出，作成信号。所以它成为自动控制系的神经中枢。
    应该指出：人不是机器，机器决不是人。这里用人来作比拟，一方面为了易于了解，另一方面也可以想像飞行器是怎样地在高度发展着。
      闯过“音障”、“热障”等重重关口，向更高的速度迈进
    “人类不是永远住在地球上的，为了寻找光明和空间，渐渐地就会飞出大气的外层，最后征服整个太阳系”。星际航行的伟大创始人乔尔可夫斯基的理想正在变成行动。到今天，人们正在进行着各种准备：探险家们正想飞翔高空做人类最大胆的发现；采矿冶金的人们要向其他行星上索取地球上没有过的稀有元素；生物学家们要研究地球以外有无动植物，以及有无有理智的高级动物生存；历史地理学者们也要了解地球以外的情况编写宇宙地理和宇宙发展史等等。总之，航空事业的发展已经站在世界科学技术飞跃发展的前哨，宇宙的秘密必将为宇宙火箭技术的成就所揭示。
    当人们能够制造飞机以后，又开始追求更高的速度，同时也遇到了各种各样的困难。当飞行速度增快到接近音速时，首先遇到了所谓“音障”问题，因为达到这样高速时，飞机机翼前沿的气流发生了激波的形式，这样向前飞行的阻力大大地增加了。经过二十多年来，在空气动力学和火箭发动机方面的努力，音障问题总算解决了，可以说飞机在发展中已经闯过了这一关。
    当飞行速度在音速的二点五倍以上时，又遇到了所谓“热障”问题。在这种情况下，围绕机翼或者航空器的空气附面层中的温度骤然增高到几百度，因而使蒙皮温度有了急剧的改变，产生了结构热应力和不稳定破坏的严重问题。这个热障关，现今也还在逐渐解决中。
    当飞入高空时，空气既稀薄，马力又要大，这一关用活塞式发动机是不能闯过的，自从火箭发动机制成后，这一斗争又取得了胜利。火箭本身既携带有所需要的全部燃料，又携带有助燃所必需的氧化剂，因而它不需要任何外界空气。相反的，它在空气越稀薄的地方，发动机的效率反而越高。火箭另外的特点是能够在几十秒或者几分钟以内，把大量的燃料燃烧成为气体，并以极大的速度喷射出去，从而产生极大的推力。
    只有航空器达到了三个临界宇宙速度以后，遨游星际才变为可能。苏联成功地发射了人造卫星和宇宙火箭，说明她已经胜利地取得了第一宇宙速度（每秒八公里）和第二宇宙速度（每秒十一点二公里）。进一步发展宇宙航行，就须向尽可能大的有效载荷和尽可能大的速度这一途径上迈进。这一预期胜利的获得，首先要进一步地改进和发展火箭发动机。这些发动机究竟是原子火箭、离子火箭、光子火箭或者其他别的东西，尚有待于科学技术的进一步发展来解决。
