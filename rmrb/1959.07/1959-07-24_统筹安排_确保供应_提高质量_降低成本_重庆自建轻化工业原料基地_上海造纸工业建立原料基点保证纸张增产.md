Overall Planning, Ensuring Supply, Improving Quality, Reducing Costs
Chongqing Self-Constructs Raw Material Base for Light and Chemical Industries
Shanghai Paper Industry Establishes Raw Material Base Points to Guarantee Paper Production Increase
(Our newspaper's dispatch from Chongqing, July 23) To ensure the supply of raw materials for light industry and the chemical industry, the relevant departments of Chongqing's light industry and chemical industry have adopted the method of overall planning and designated locations to establish and cultivate raw material bases for light and chemical industries.

Chongqing's light and chemical industry raw materials are supplied under the unified plan of the state, some of which are purchased by commercial departments and then allocated; however, many are directly supplied to relevant enterprises by certain special districts, counties, or factories designated by Sichuan Province. Now, after reaching agreements and signing contracts between the demand and supply sides, many light and chemical enterprises have their own raw material bases.

Chongqing's light and chemical industry departments have made comprehensive arrangements for their raw material bases in terms of technology, labor, and transportation. Some industries have established processing plants in the raw material bases and built roads, which greatly reduced the cost of raw materials and solved the difficulties of inconvenient transportation in mountainous areas. Chongqing No. 601 Paper Mill established bamboo chip processing plants in Nanchuan and Fengdu counties in the Fuling Special District, which is rich in bamboo. These plants have more than 1,000 employees and cut more than 30,000 tons of fresh bamboo annually, processing the bamboo into bamboo chips before transporting them to Chongqing. This paper mill also built 87 kilometers of simple roads from the bamboo forest areas of these two counties, directly connecting to the main highway, to facilitate the transportation of bamboo materials. Chongqing Thermos Bottle Factory jointly established a thermos bottle bamboo shell processing plant in Changning County, Yibin Special District, Sichuan, using local materials to meet the needs of this thermos bottle factory to produce more than 2 million bamboo shell thermos bottles annually.

Some light and chemical industries also provide technical guidance to the production of bases, which guarantees the quality of raw materials. For example, Chongqing No. 1 Silk Textile Factory set up 29 silkworm farms in the Jiangjin Special District, the raw material base for silk. Every year when mulberry trees sprout, the silk factory organizes technical forces to assist local farmers, providing technical guidance from silkworm egg hatching to cocooning. This guarantees the quality of the cocoons. At the same time, because the silk textile factory and the raw material base cooperated well, there were very few cases of maggots and moths in this year's cocoons, ensuring a bumper harvest of cocoons. The city's purchase volume of spring silkworm cocoons alone accounted for more than 90% of the annual purchase plan (including autumn silkworm cocoons), greatly exceeding the original spring silkworm cocoon purchase plan, and fully meeting the raw material needs of Chongqing's silk textile industry.

Establishing raw material bases in the near suburbs and district-owned small factories is an effective measure for Chongqing's light and chemical industries to ensure timely supply of raw materials and reduce costs. For example, the main raw materials for the glass industry, dolomite and feldspar, were originally transported from Hunan. Due to the long distance, the supply was often untimely and the cost was high. However, the dolomite and feldspar produced in Jiangbei District of Chongqing were transported to Shanghai. To change this unreasonable phenomenon, Jiangbei District has now been designated to supply dolomite and feldspar to Chongqing's glass industry. Another important raw material for glass, soda ash, is manufactured and supplied by Guangli Chemical Plant in Beibei District, eliminating the need for long-distance transportation from Tianjin and other places. To solve the problem of hops raw materials, Chongqing Brewery reached an agreement with the communes in the suburbs of the city and sent people to the Northeast to learn planting techniques. At present, the communes in the suburbs of the city have allocated some land specifically for cultivation bases, and it is expected that the city's hops needs will be self-sufficient next year. The chemical industry needs more than 2 million pottery jars in the city this year, and the chemical factories have organized more than a dozen small pottery factories in the Chongqing urban area to manufacture and supply them, and provide assistance in terms of technology and investment in expanding pottery factory equipment.

(Our newspaper's dispatch from Shanghai, July 23) Shanghai's paper industry has adopted the method of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, and linking pulp and paper," and has established more than 80 raw material base points for paper pulp in neighboring areas, greatly expanding the source of papermaking raw materials and playing a powerful role in increasing paper production.

Shanghai's paper industry began to establish raw material base points in the fourth quarter of last year. At that time, on the one hand, because the quantity of fiber raw materials such as wood pulp and reed pulp used in the past was decreasing as paper production developed in various regions; on the other hand, the state required Shanghai's paper production to increase by another 60% on the basis of the 30% increase already achieved last year. At the same time, in the mass technical innovation movement carried out by Shanghai paper mills last year, the speed of the old paper machines was generally increased, and many factories concentrated scattered parts and added fourteen new paper machines. This required the establishment of large raw material base points to ensure supply, but at the beginning, many people did not have enough understanding of this, so the work did not progress quickly.

At the beginning of this year, Shanghai's paper industry, when studying the production plan, especially emphasized the establishment of raw material base points, to achieve self-reliance in solving raw material difficulties, and the significance of this for Shanghai's paper production development. The Rural Work Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China discussed this issue at several meetings of the directors of the industrial bureaus of the eleven counties held at the beginning of the year; a paper pulp group was also established under the Local Industry Office of the Rural Work Committee of the Municipal Committee, specifically responsible for the planning of grass pulp production, thereby promoting the comprehensive development of the base point establishment work.

The principle of establishing raw material base points in Shanghai is "pulp first, paper second, indigenous first, foreign second," and different methods are adopted according to different requirements. For example, the raw material base points established in Huzhou, Zhejiang and other places are relatively far away, large in scale, and require high quality of grass pulp. These pulp mills are assisted by the paper company with concentrated technical strength and material equipment to build factories. The eleven neighboring counties are designated by the company to eleven paper mills, adopting the direct linkage of one factory to one county, with each county providing people and money, and the installation of equipment, production technology, and personnel training in the factory construction are all the responsibility of the linked factory, and the grass pulp produced is first used to meet the needs of the linked factory.

Adopting this method of obtaining materials locally and expanding raw material sources through self-reliance has given full play to the enthusiasm of factory employees. When Qinfeng Paper Mill helped Shanghai County to build a pulp mill, it took out many unused equipment from the factory for them; many cadres in the factory who were sent down to this county for labor training also went to help them design factory buildings and install equipment with the approval of their superiors; many technical problems in the early stage of production were also quickly resolved. Each county in the suburbs also fully assisted the factory in developing the raw material processing of rice straw pulp because the production of indigenous grass pulp is easy to operate, technically more reliable, and the income is relatively high.

After half a year of efforts, these raw material base points have played a great role in ensuring the increase of paper production in Shanghai. In the first quarter, the indigenous grass pulp produced by the pulp mills in the eleven counties in the suburbs of Shanghai alone was 4,000 tons, and in the second quarter, it increased to more than 8,000 tons. Adding the paper pulp from dozens of base points in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places, Shanghai can now obtain more than 7,000 tons a month. In the second quarter, the amount of indigenous grass pulp used accounted for one-third of all raw materials. To overcome the difficulties of making paper with indigenous grass pulp, many factories mobilized the masses to make many technical improvements.

The experience of Shanghai's paper industry in establishing raw material base points has recently attracted the attention of relevant departments. The Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry is promoting this approach in Shanghai to promote the increase in paper production.

    上海造纸工业建立原料基点保证纸张增产
    本报重庆23日电　为了确保轻工业和化学工业原材料供应，重庆轻工业和化学工业有关部门，采取统筹安排、划片定点的办法，建立和培养轻、化工业原料基地。
    重庆轻、化工业原料由国家统筹计划供应，其中有的由商业部门收购以后，再调拨；但也有不少是由四川省划定某些专区、县或工厂，直接供应有关企业的。现在，经需要和供应双方取得协议，签订合同，不少轻、化工企业都有了自己的原料基地。
    重庆轻、化工业部门对自己的原料基地在技术、劳动、运输力量等方面，都作了全面安排。有的行业到原料基地设立加工厂，修建公路，大大降低了原料成本和解决了山区运输不便的困难。重庆六○一造纸厂在盛产竹子的涪陵专区南川、酆都两县设立竹片加工厂，有职工一千多人，年砍鲜竹三万多吨，将竹子加工成竹片以后，再运到重庆。这个造纸厂还从这两个县的竹林区修了简易公路八十七公里，直通主要公路干线，便于运输竹料。重庆热水瓶厂在四川宜宾专区长宁县与当地合办一个热水瓶竹壳加工厂，就地取材，满足这个热水瓶厂年产两百多万个竹壳水瓶的需要。
    有的轻、化工行业还从技术上指导基地生产，对原料质量起了保证作用。例如重庆第一丝纺织厂在蚕丝原料基地江津专区设蚕庄二十九个，每年一到桑树发芽的时候，丝厂便组织技术力量前去协助当地农民，从蚕子孵化到结茧，都给予技术指导，这样做对茧子质量起了保证作用。同时由于丝纺织厂和原料基地双方协作配合得好，使今年的蚕茧出蛆、出蛾的现象很少，保证了蚕茧丰收，今年全市仅春蚕茧的收购量便占全年收购计划（包括秋蚕茧）的90％以上，大大超过原订春蚕茧收购计划，充分满足了重庆丝纺织业的原料需要。
    在近郊和区属各小厂建立原料基地，是重庆市轻、化工业原料供应及时和降低成本的有效措施。例如玻璃行业用的主要原料白云石和长石，原来依靠湖南运来，因路途遥远，往往供应不及时，成本也高。而重庆江北区出产的白云石和长石却又运到上海去。为了改变这种不合理现象，现在已指定江北区将白云石和长石供应重庆玻璃行业。另一种玻璃重要原料纯碱，由北碚区广利化工厂制造供应，不需要再从天津等地远途运输进来。重庆啤酒厂为了解决酒花原料，与市郊公社取得协议，派人到东北去学习种植。目前，市郊公社已划出部分土地专作培植基地，预计明年全市所需酒花便能自给。化学工业全市今年需要陶坛两百多万个，化工各厂即组织重庆市区十几家小陶器厂制造供应，并从技术上，从扩大陶器厂设备的投资上给予协助。
    本报上海23日电　上海造纸工业采取“土洋挂钩、浆纸对口”的办法，在邻近地区建立了八十多个纸浆原料基点，大大扩大了造纸原料的来源，对增产纸张起了有力的保证作用。
    上海造纸工业建立原料基点工作是在去年第四季度开始的。当时，一方面是因为过去所用的木浆、苇浆等纤维原料，在各地发展纸张生产后，供应给上海的数量日益减少；另一方面国家要求上海纸张的产量在去年已经提高30％的基础上再增加60％。同时，上海造纸厂在去年开展群众性的技术革新运动中，老纸机的车速普遍提高，还有许多工厂把分散的零星部件集中起来，增添了十四台新纸机。这就需要大建原料基点，保证供应，但开始时有许多人对此认识不足，所以工作进展得并不快。
    今年年初，上海市造纸工业在研究生产计划时，特别强调建立原料基点，做到自力更生解决原料困难，对上海发展纸张生产的意义。中共上海市委农村工作委员会在年初召开的几次十一个县工业局局长会议，都讨论了这个问题；在市委农村工作委员会地方工业办公室下面还成立了一个纸浆小组，专门负责草浆生产规划工作，从而推动了建点工作的全面展开。
    上海建立原料基点的原则是“先浆后纸，先土后洋”，根据不同的要求，采取不同的办法。例如在浙江湖州等地建立的原料基点，因为路途较远，规模较大，草浆质量要求较高，这类浆厂由造纸公司集中较多的技术力量和物资设备，帮助他们建厂。邻近的十一个县，公司指定十一个纸厂，采取一厂对一县的直接挂钩对口，由各县出人出钱，建厂中的设备安装、生产技术、人员培训等方面的工作，全部由挂钩工厂负责，所生产的草浆也首先满足挂钩厂的需要。
    采取这种就地取材、自力更生扩大原料来源的办法，使各厂职工积极性有了用武之地。勤丰造纸厂在帮助上海县建立浆厂时，把许多厂内不用的设备拿出来给他们；厂里许多下放在这个县劳动锻炼的干部，经上级同意，也都纷纷前去帮助他们设计厂房和安装设备；生产初期的许多技术问题也都很快得到解决。郊区各县也因为生产土草浆操作简易，技术上较有把握，收入也较多，都全力协助工厂发展稻草浆的原料加工。
    经过这半年来的努力，这些原料基点在保证上海纸张增产中，已经发挥了很大的作用。第一季度，单上海市郊十一个县办的纸浆厂生产的土草浆就有四千吨，第二季度提高到八千吨以上。加上从江苏、浙江等地几十个基点来的纸浆，现在上海一个月可以得到七千吨以上。第二季度，土草浆的用量要占到全部原料的三分之一。为了克服用土草浆造纸的困难，许多工厂发动群众在技术上作了许多改进。
    上海造纸工业建立原料基点的经验最近已经引起有关部门的重视，轻工业部造纸工业局正在推广上海这种作法，来促进纸张生产的提高。
