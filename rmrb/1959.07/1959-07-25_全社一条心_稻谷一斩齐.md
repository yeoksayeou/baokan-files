The whole commune united as one, harvesting rice with uniformity

\tAt dusk, I came to Shahe Slope again.

\tThis year, the rice at Shahe Slope is truly lovely. At first glance, it's a golden expanse; upon closer inspection, you'll notice: first, there isn't a single barnyard grass; second, it's uniformly level; third, the ears of rice are densely packed, as if assembled by hand, with no space for a needle to enter, and unmoved by the wind. As I looked, I became lost in thought.

\t"The rice is really growing well!" A voice behind me startled me. I turned around, and ah! It was old man Li Zhongyi.

\tHe invited me to sit on the ridge. We smoked and chatted.

\t"These two things, this year, we've truly put our words into action!" the old man began with this sentence.

\t"Which two things?" I really didn't understand what the old man meant.

\t"That is, no mixed strains and no barnyard grass! Look how uniformly the rice is growing, compared to previous years..."

\tHis words also brought my thoughts back to previous years.

\tIn 1957, I stayed here. It was during this time that a considerable dispute arose within the advanced cooperative over the harvesting of rice. With only half a month until the beginning of autumn, the early rice, according to the old folks, had grown into a "grandfather-grandson class" or a "three-story building" – meaning that 60% had already ripened, lying in the fields waiting to be harvested; this was the first layer, the older generation; 30% had only just begun to droop, standing upright, swaying in the wind, and still growing; this was the second layer, the second generation; and a few percent had just emerged from the rice sheaths, standing straight in the fields, like innocent children; this was the highest layer, also the youngest generation. Therefore, some advocated for waiting a period, while others advocated for starting the harvest immediately. After arguing back and forth, only one side could be saved, so it was decided to save the larger portion and discard the smaller portion.

\tThat year, everyone made a resolution: to thoroughly select all seeds for the coming year by the grain.

\tIn 1958, the early rice varieties were much purer, and the rice grew uniformly. However, the barnyard grass was exceptionally abundant! It stood proudly in the fields, shielding the rice ears, preventing the golden rice from shining brightly.

\tWhen asked about the reason, people had different explanations. However, the challenge before us was even more difficult to overcome than in 1957. The early rice harvest was taking place during a prolonged drought, and every plot of late rice paddy needed water to be pumped, so labor was truly stretched thin. Therefore, there was no time to select seeds in the fields, and the rice was harvested along with the barnyard grass. The seeds for 1959 were still uncertain.

\tToday, I came here to participate in the summer harvest and planting. After getting off the train, I first ran to Shahe Slope. To be honest, as I walked on the road, I thought that this year's early rice here might even produce a "four-story building"! It was truly unexpected; this year's early rice here is growing so well!

\t"How exactly did you put your words into action?" I blurted out.

\t"Hehe! The first thing is thanks to the People's Commune!" the old man opened up. "But it wasn't easy! At the beginning of spring, the commune called for the realization of no mixed strains and no barnyard grass. But the people here said that the first goal couldn't be achieved. The problem was reported to the commune, and then came a commune-wide assistance, with one production team contributing 10,000 [jin of rice], another 15,000 [jin of rice], rice exchanged for rice. It is said that they even specially selected the best [seeds] to send to us, and that's how we got these good seeds."

\t"After the early rice was planted, the cadres stayed up several nights in a row, formulating management measures: three or five households in a production team were divided into a group, and weeding, topdressing, and pulling barnyard grass were all assigned to the groups, and work was contracted out, all the way until the early rice harvest."

\t"This method is very effective," the old man said with great approval: "In the past, only those who had to work at the bottom of the pile would go to the fields, but now even the elderly and children are taking action. This is called unleashing the enthusiasm of the masses!"

\t"Barnyard grass is the overlord of fertilizer snatching. Removing all the barnyard grass is as good as applying a large amount of manure." He then used his pipe to draw a semicircle from left to right, "Look, how could this rice not grow well!"

### 全社一条心　稻谷一斩齐

    全社一条心　稻谷一斩齐
    黄昏，我又来到沙河坂。
    今年，沙河坂的稻谷，的确长得爱人。粗看金黄一色；细看，你就会看出：第一、没有一根稗草，第二、一掌平，第三、穗子密密层层，像是用人工堆集起来的，针插不进，风吹不动。看着看着，我看出了神。
      “谷，委实是长得好！”身后有一个声音把我唤醒。回头一看，啊！原来是李中仪老头。
    他邀我在田埂上坐了下来。我们就一边吸烟，一边扯起来。
      “这两件事，今年算是真正的说到做到了！”老人开头就是这一句话。
      “哪两件事？”我确实没有领会老人的意思。
      “就是无杂种、无稗子呀！你看这谷长得多齐斩，比起前两年……”
    他一句话，也把我的思潮带到前几年去了。
    1957年，我在这里住过。也正在这个时候，当时的高级社里为着割谷的事引起了一场不小的争执。到立秋只半个月时间了，当时的早稻照老人们的说法是长出一个“公孙班”、“三层楼”——即有60％已经黄熟了，伏在田里等待收割，这算第一层，老一代；30％几才刚刚勾头，直起腰身，迎风摇摆，还正好长哩，这是第二层，第二代；还有百分之几刚从稻苞里抽出来，笔挺笔挺地站在田里，像是一个幼稚无知的孩子，这算是最高的一层，也是最小的一代。因此有人主张要蓄一个时期，也有人主张就动手割。争来争去，两头都只救得一头，最后就决定救大头丢小头。
    这一年，大家下了一个决心：要来年的种子全部进行粒选。
    1958年，早稻品种是纯得多了，谷长得一斩齐。可是稗草却多得出奇！它骄傲地耸立田里，遮在谷穗上，使金黄的谷子放不出光彩。
    问起原因，人们说法不一。然而摆在面前的难题，却比1957年更难克服。早稻收割正处在久旱不雨情况下，丘丘晚稻田都要车水，劳力实在忙不来，因此顾不得在田间选种，谷是同稗子一起割起来的。1959年的种子还是没有着落。
    今天，我是来这里参加夏收夏种的。下了火车，一个人又先跑到沙河坂来。老实说，这回走在路上，我想着今年这里的早稻，也许要出现一个“四层楼”哩！真是出人意外，今年这里的早稻竟长得这样好！
    “到底是怎样说到做到的呢？”我不觉脱口说了出来。
    “嘿嘿！这头一件就要归功人民公社！”老人打开了话匣子。“可也不容易呀！开春，公社号召要实现无杂种、无稗草。可我们这里人说头一条就达不到，问题反映到公社，就来了一个全公社大支援，这个队一万，那个队一万五，谷换谷。据说人家还特别拣好的送给我们，才换了这些好种。”
    “早稻插下去了，干部们接连熬了几个夜，定出了管理办法：一个生产队三户、五户划一个小组，把耘草、追肥、拔稗子都分到组里，又包了工，一直到早稻收割。”
      “这个办法很有效，”老人十分称许地说：“在早先只有站底分的人才下田，可现在老人孩子也都行动了，这叫做发挥了群众积极性呀！”
      “稗子是拔肥的霸王，除光了稗子就当得上一次大粪。”他又用烟袋从左到右划了一个半圆圈，“你看，这个谷还能长得不好呀！”
