    Better Implement the Party's Mass Line Policy

    The mass line is the fundamental line in our Party's work.

    Marxism believes that history is created by the people, that the people must liberate themselves, and that the working class must rely on the strength of its own class and the strength of all working people to liberate all working people and liberate itself at the same time. The Party is neither a small group seeking private gain, nor a "hero" who can do everything alone, but a loyal tool for the people to engage in the struggle for liberation. Therefore, serving the people wholeheartedly, trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and never separating from the masses becomes the fundamental starting point for all our Party's work.

    For thirty-eight years, our Party has accumulated extremely rich experience in implementing the mass line. These experiences have been successfully summarized in our Party Constitution and in Chairman Mao's works. These experiences have become the spiritual wealth of the entire Party, guiding us in the correct direction of work and inspiring us to continue to move forward.

    The superiority of the socialist system, the revolutionary enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses, and the correct direction of the General Line have provided us with favorable conditions for carrying out socialist construction at high speed. However, in a certain period, how the work tasks should be determined must be fully discussed with the masses, and the level of awareness and actual possibilities of the masses must be fully estimated. If the tasks are set too low, they will not meet the demands of the masses, suppress their enthusiasm, and become divorced from the masses; if the tasks are set too high, exceeding the actual possibilities, they will also dampen the enthusiasm of the masses and similarly become divorced from the masses. Some of our comrades often do not pay attention to consulting with the masses when determining work tasks. They believe that stipulating tasks is only the business of the higher authorities, and that following the mass line by consulting with the lower levels and the masses is just a matter of studying the methods and ways of implementation. As a result, either the task itself is unrealistically defined (too high or too low), affecting the enthusiasm of the masses, or although the task is defined relatively realistically, the initiative and enthusiasm of the masses cannot be well developed because they did not participate in the discussion. Therefore, when determining work tasks, we must never leave the masses aside, but should fully consult with them. At the same time as determining work tasks, it is also necessary to solve the problem of working methods. Any work task, if the problem of working methods is not solved, cannot be well completed, or even if it is completed, it will cause a lot of harm. Some comrades only pay attention to completing tasks or assigning tasks, but do not pay attention to studying or explaining working methods. They believe that working methods are trivial matters. Obviously, this is a one-sided understanding of the consistency of work tasks and working methods, and is the ideological root cause of generating or promoting bureaucratic and commandist tendencies.

    Correctly handling the relationship between the majority and the minority is also an important issue in implementing the mass line. In any place with the masses, there are roughly three parts: the more active, the intermediate, and the more backward, and the more active and the more backward often account for the minority. This is the general law of mass movements. Therefore, the task of the leadership lies in "being good at uniting the minority of activists as the leading backbone, and relying on this backbone to raise the intermediate elements and win over the backward elements."

    Activists are generally in the minority, especially in the early stages of a movement, but they are highly conscious, energetic, and quick to accept new things, representing the direction of the movement's progress. Therefore, in implementing the mass line, we should rely on, cherish, and actively help them. Without relying on this minority, we cannot improve and unite the majority. Any view that looks down on this minority and any practice that frustrates their enthusiasm is detrimental to the mass movement. However, all our work can only be done well by relying on the active and conscious actions of the broad masses. Our purpose in relying on, cherishing, and helping the minority of activists is also to unite and improve the broad masses through them and to give play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses. Any work task, if only a few people are enthusiastic but not the broad masses, is bound to fail. This is one aspect of the relationship between the majority and the minority.

    On the other hand, there is the issue of backward elements. Backward elements are generally also in the minority. For various reasons, they temporarily disagree with or even oppose our proposals. But they are, in any case, part of the working masses, and their opinions often help us to consider problems from another perspective. Moreover, these people are not backward on all issues, and their opinions are not all wrong. Therefore, this minority cannot be ignored or discriminated against, but should be patiently and gradually won over and improved. Nor should we reject their opinions simply because of who they are.

    When implementing the mass line and carrying out various work tasks, we have always advocated uniting, relying on, and depending on the majority, which is easy to understand. But two points deserve special attention: First, we must be good at distinguishing between appearance and essence, and not be satisfied with superficial "support" and agreement. We must use the method of class analysis to identify true and false phenomena from real life. This is especially important for a ruling and prestigious party like ours. Second, in general, the opinions of the majority are correct, but sometimes the truth lies with the minority. Therefore, on the one hand, we must value the opinions of the majority, and on the other hand, we must also pay attention to listening to the opinions of the minority. Many things should not be decided by simple voting, but should be fully deliberated, discussed, or debated, and the minority should be allowed to reserve their opinions and respect the due rights of the minority.

    The Party is the vanguard of the working class and all working people, the most advanced and most conscious part. It should lead the people and can lead the people, but to achieve leadership, it must humbly learn from the masses. This is the relationship between being a teacher and being a student.

    To implement leadership, it is not enough to rely solely on one's own experience. The title of Party member or a revolutionary position does not give us knowledge and experience. Therefore, we must learn from the masses and be good at absorbing the experience of the masses to supplement our own shortcomings. Our Party has rich experience in leading the masses in revolutionary wars and social reforms. Much of this experience is still very useful, but leading socialist construction is, after all, a new issue. The status of the ruling party can easily breed complacency in some people, who look down on the masses. Therefore, we must especially emphasize learning from the masses, learning from those with rich practical life knowledge and production experience, and learning from those with scientific and cultural knowledge. Some people are only willing to learn from higher levels, from leaders, and from those who are more capable than themselves, but are unwilling to learn from lower levels, from the masses, and from those who are less capable than themselves. This is a one-sided view. "From the masses, to the masses" itself includes the requirement to humbly learn from the masses. Without a humble spirit of learning, especially learning from the masses and from lower levels, it is impossible to earnestly implement the Party's mass line. Only by humbly learning from the people, absorbing and concentrating the knowledge and experience of the masses, can we achieve correct leadership. Only by being a student can we be a teacher.

### 更好地执行党的群众路线的方针

    更好地执行党的群众路线的方针
    群众路线，是我们党的工作中的根本的路线。
    马克思主义认为：历史是人民群众创造的，人民群众必须自己解放自己，工人阶级必须依靠本阶级的力量和全体劳动人民的力量才能解放全体劳动人民，同时也解放自己。党既不是谋取私利的小集团，也不是包打天下的“英雄好汉”，而是人民群众从事解放斗争的忠实的工具。因此，全心全意为人民群众服务，相信群众，依靠群众，一刻也不脱离群众就成为我们党的一切工作的根本出发点。
    三十八年来，在贯彻群众路线方面，我们党积累了极为丰富的经验，这些经验在我们的党章中，在毛主席的著作中都有过成功的概括和总结。这些经验成为全党的精神财富，指引给我们正确的工作方向，鼓舞着我们继续前进。
    社会主义制度的优越性，广大群众的革命热情和劳动积极性，总路线的正确的方向，使我们有了高速度进行社会主义建设的有利条件，但是在一定时期，工作任务究竟应当怎样确定，必须充分的和群众商量，充分估计到群众的觉悟程度和实际的可能性。任务订的太低了，满足不了群众的要求，会压制群众的积极性，脱离群众；订的太高了，超过实际的可能性，也会挫伤群众的积极性，同样脱离群众。我们有些同志在确定工作任务时，往往不注意和群众商量，他们认为规定任务只是上级的事，走群众路线和下级商量和群众商量，不过研究研究执行的方法、办法罢了。这样一来，不是任务本身规定的不切实（过高或过低），影响群众的积极性，就是任务虽然规定的比较切实，但群众由于没有参加讨论，他们的主动性、积极性也不能得到很好的发挥。因此，在确定工作任务时决不应当把群众抛在一边，而应当充分地和群众商量。在确定工作任务的同时，还必须解决工作方法问题。任何工作任务如果不解决工作方法问题，也不能很好地完成，或虽然完成了而贻害甚多。有些同志只注意完成任务或布置任务，而不注意研究或交代工作方法，他们认为工作方法是小事情。显然，这是对于工作任务和工作方法一致性的片面的理解，是产生或助长官僚主义和命令主义偏向的思想根源。
    正确处理多数和少数的关系同样是贯彻群众路线的一个重要问题。任何有群众的地方，大致上都有比较积极的、中间状态的和比较落后的三部分人，而比较积极的和比较落后的往往都占少数，这是群众运动的一般规律。因此，领导的任务就在于“善于团结少数积极分子作为领导骨干，并凭借这批骨干去提高中间分子，争取落后分子”。
    积极分子在一般情况下，特别是在运动初期总是少数，但他们觉悟高，干劲足，接受新事物快，代表着运动前进的方向。因此，在贯彻群众路线时应当依靠、爱护和积极帮助他们，不依靠这个少数，就不能提高和团结多数。任何看不起这个少数的观点和挫伤他们的积极性的作法都是对群众运动不利的。但是我们的一切工作毕竟是只有依靠广大群众的积极的自觉的行动才能作好。我们依靠、爱护和帮助少数积极分子的目的，也在于通过他们去团结和提高广大群众，发挥广大群众的积极性。任何工作任务如果只有少数人的积极性而无广大群众的积极性，是一定作不好的。这是多数和少数关系的一个方面。
    另一方面是对于落后分子的问题。落后分子一般情况下也是少数，他们因为种种原因暂时不同意，甚至反对我们的主张。但他们无论如何是劳动群众的一部分，他们的意见往往帮助我们从另一方面考虑问题，而且这些人并非在一切问题上都落后，他们的意见也不都是错误的。因此，对这个少数也不能忽视或歧视，而要耐心地逐步地争取和提高他们，更不能因人废言。
    在贯彻群众路线执行各项工作任务时，我们始终主张团结、依靠和取决于多数，这是容易理解的。但有两点值得特别注意：第一，要善于区别现象和本质，不要满足于表面的“拥护”和赞成，要用阶级分析的方法，从实际生活中识别真象和假象，这对于像我们这样的执政的有威信的党特别重要；第二，一般情况下，多数人的意见是正确的，但有时真理在少数人方面，因此，一方面我们要重视多数人的意见，同时也要注意听取少数人的意见，许多事情不应当采取简单的表决的办法，而要进行充分的酝酿讨论或辩论，并允许少数人保留意见，尊重少数人应有的权利。
    党是工人阶级和一切劳动人民的先锋队，是最先进最觉悟的部分，它应当领导人民群众，也能够领导人民群众，但要实现领导必须虚心向群众学习，这就是当先生和当学生的关系。
    要实行领导单靠自己的经验是不够的。单靠党员的称号、革命的职位并不能给我们以知识和经验，因此必须向群众学习，善于吸收群众的经验来补充自己的不足。我们党有丰富的领导群众进行革命战争和社会改革的经验，这些经验，有许多还是非常有用的，但领导社会主义建设毕竟是新问题，执政党的地位，很容易在某些人身上滋长骄傲情绪，看不起群众。因此要特别强调向群众学习，向有丰富的实际生活知识和生产经验的人学习，向有科学文化知识的人学习。有些人只愿意向上级学习，向领导人学习，向比自己水平高的人学习，而不愿向下级学习，向群众学习，向比自己水平低的人学习，这是一种片面的观点。“从群众中来，到群众中去”本身就包括虚心向群众学习的要求，如果没有虚心学习，特别是向群众向下级学习的精神，是不能认真地贯彻党的群众路线的，只有虚心向人民群众学习，吸取和集中群众的知识和经验，才能实现正确的领导。只有当学生才能当先生。
