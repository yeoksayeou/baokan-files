Rich and Colorful National Musical Instruments

Our national musical instruments have a long history. As early as more than 3,000 years ago, there were instruments such as chimes, drums, and bells. During the Yin and Shang Dynasties, there were bronze bells, rattles, ocarinas and xiao. By the Warring States period,簧管, stringed instruments, and various percussion instruments could form a large orchestra with rich expressive capabilities.

Among the many excellent instruments created by our ancestors, Sheng is a very important invention. This instrument produces sound by utilizing the vibration of air within the pipes. Europeans used its principles to create organs, accordions, and harmonicas. In ancient China, the working people solved complex casting techniques to manufacture bells, using the lost-wax casting method, which not only could cast exquisite patterns but also cast specific pitches. This casting method is still an advanced technology today. The Tang Dynasty was the most developed period of ancient Chinese music. The Tang Dynasty instrument—the seven-stringed zither—is still preserved in the Palace Museum. The musical instruments brought by Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty when she married into Tibet are also still preserved in Tibet.

In the past century, due to the oppression of imperialism and feudal rule, the national musical instrument industry once declined, and it only began to recover and develop after liberation.

There are many types of national musical instruments, roughly including the following:

Percussion Instruments

Any instrument that produces sound by striking is called a percussion instrument. This includes gongs, drums, cymbals, pi, bells, chimes, clappers, woodblocks, and wooden xylophones. Chinese percussion instruments have very complex performance and orchestration methods. All kinds of operas rely on percussion instruments to depict the actions and emotions of characters. With percussion instruments, the rhythm of dance and chanting can be strengthened, creating important atmospheres in the plot, and leading the audience into the realm of the drama.

Stringed Instruments

Also called plucked instruments, including the seven-stringed zither, se, zheng, pipa, qinqin, yueqin, konghou, yangqin, sanxian, etc. The seven-stringed zither, also called the guqin, is one of the oldest instruments in China. Legend has it that Kongming's "Empty City Stratagem" used the guqin to scare away Sima Yi's army; Zhuo Wenjun fell in love with Sima Xiangru after hearing the beautiful sounds of the guqin he played. The reason why the guqin is so loved is that it can play just intonation scales and can modulate, and its harmonics are very pure and beautiful. When you press and stroke the strings with your left hand, the deep and meaningful sound seems to wash the spirit of the listener. Many ancient guqin scores have been preserved, which is a very valuable musical heritage. The pipa is also a very good instrument. Its bass is solid and full, and its treble is crisp and sonorous. Its playing techniques and expressive capabilities are complete and diverse. Using the five fingers of the right hand in a tremolo, it can express tranquility like a moonlit night, or urgency like a torrential rain.

Bowed String Instruments

Including instruments such as jinghu, chuanhu, gaiban, jing erhu, erhu, yehu, zhuihu, and zazheng, these are relatively complete instruments. The main accompaniment instrument for Yuan Dynasty opera was the sanxian; the main accompaniment instrument for Kunqu opera was the dizi. In modern times, the main accompaniment instruments for Peking opera and various local operas are bowed string instruments. Jinghu and jing erhu are the most familiar instruments; the jinghu can produce high, bright and lively sounds, with a large volume. When the jing erhu and jinghu play together, the sound of the jing erhu is lower and clearer, as if wrapping the sound of the jinghu inside, giving people a feeling of unity. The jinghu has a unique style among bowed string instruments in the world, and it can really be described as "ups and downs." It is often accompanied independently without feeling monotonous. The erhu (nanhu) was originally popular in Guangdong. Its sound is a bit like a violin, but its low and middle notes are much softer and warmer than the violin. The performance is full of poetic imagery, and the kindness of a mother's voice, deeply loved by the people. The erhu has become the main instrument in the national orchestra.

Wind Instruments

Including instruments such as xiao, dizi, sheng, guan, throat pipes, suona, and panpipes, they mainly produce sound by the vibration of air inside the pipes. Xiao, dizi, panpipes, xiao and dizi are the most popular instruments. The panpipes are a chromatic instrument composed of fourteen pipes, used by ancient court orchestras in ensembles. The panpipes are considered the earliest chromatic wind instrument in the world, but unfortunately, no one can play them now.

In addition, there are the matouqin and sihu favored by the Mongolian people, the genka of the Tibetan people, the dutar of the Uygur people, the lusheng of the Miao people, and the bawu of the Hani people, etc. The matouqin is an instrument used by Mongolian wandering poets for accompaniment; the bawu is an instrument made of reed or bamboo pipes, and it sounds very much like a transverse flute when played. This instrument is also very popular among the Miao people, and there are many bawu solo pieces, with a rich and profound tone, which is very beautiful to listen to. People often use it to accompany dancing or to express love.

### 丰富多彩的民族乐器

    丰富多彩的民族乐器
    我国的民族乐器有着悠久的历史，远在三千多年以前就有了磬、鼓、钟等乐器；殷商时代，又有铜制的钟、铃和埙箫；到了战国，簧管、弹弦和各色各样的打击乐器，已经可以组成表现能力很丰富的大型乐队了。
    我们的祖先，创造的很多优秀乐器中，笙类是很重要的发明，这种乐器是利用管内的空气振动，而发声的。欧洲人利用它的原理，制成了风琴、手风琴和口琴。我国古代的劳动人民，为了制造钟，解决了复杂的铸造技术，采用腊型铸造，不但能铸出精美的花纹，而且铸出一定的音高。这种铸造方法，在现代也是一种先进技术。唐代是我国古代音乐最发达的时期，唐代乐器——七弦琴直到现在还保存在故宫博物院里。唐代文成公主出嫁到西藏时，带去的乐器，也还在西藏保存着。
    近百年来我国由于帝国主义和封建统治的压迫，民族乐器行业一度衰退，直到解放后，才开始恢复和发展。
    民族乐器的种类很多，大致有下面几种：
    打击乐器
    凡是用打击的方法使之发音的乐器，都叫打击乐器。包括锣、鼓、铙、铍、铃、钟、磬、板、木鱼、木琴等。我国的打击乐器有很复杂的演奏和配器方法。各种戏剧都是靠打击乐器来描写人物的动作和感情的。有了打击乐器，就可以加强舞蹈、咏唱的节奏，创造剧情中的重要气氛，把观众引入戏剧的境界。
    弹弦乐器
    也叫弹拨乐器，包括七弦琴、瑟、筝、琵琶、秦琴、月琴、箜篌、扬琴、三弦等。七弦琴也叫古琴，是我国古老的乐器之一，传说孔明的“空城计”就是弹着古琴吓退了司马懿的大军；卓文君听到了司马相如弹出美妙的琴声，就爱上了他。古琴所以这样受人喜爱，是因为它能弹出纯律的音阶，又能转调，它的泛音非常纯洁优美。当你左手按抚着琴弦，弹出意味深长的声音，使人听了精神好像受到了洗练。古代的七弦琴谱保存很多，这是非常可贵的音乐遗产。琵琶也是一种很好的乐器，它的低音结实、饱满，高音清脆铿锵，弹奏技术和表现能力都完善而多样。用右手五指轮弹，可以表现静如月夜，急如骤雨。
    拉弦乐器
    包括京胡、川胡、盖板、京二胡、二胡、椰胡、坠胡、扎筝等乐器，这些都是比较健全的乐器。元曲主要的伴奏乐器是三弦；昆曲主要的伴奏乐器是笛子。近代，京戏和各种地方戏，主要伴奏乐器是拉弦乐器。京胡、京二胡是人们最熟悉的乐器；京胡能拉出高爽明快的声音，音量很大。京二胡和京胡合奏时，京二胡的声音较低而清亮，好像把京胡的声音包在里面似的，使人听了有合而为一的感觉。京胡在世界拉弦乐器中具有独特的风格，实在可以用“抑扬顿挫”四个字来形容它。它常常是独立地伴奏，而不觉得单调。二胡（南胡），最初流行在广东。它的声音有点像小提琴，低中音却比小提琴柔和温厚得多，演奏时充满了诗一般的意境，慈母声音般的亲切，深受人民的喜爱。二胡已经成为民族管弦乐队的主要乐器。
    管乐器
    包括箫、笛、笙、管、喉管、唢呐、排箫等乐器，它们主要是靠管内的空气振动发音的。箫、笛、排箫、箫笛是最大众化的乐器。排箫是十四根管子组成的半音阶乐器，古代宫庭乐队合奏时使用它。世界上半音阶的吹奏乐器，排箫算是最早的乐器，可惜现在已经没有人能够吹奏了。
    此外还有蒙古民族喜爱的马头琴、四胡，藏族人的根卡、维吾尔族的冬不拉、苗族的芦笙、哈尼族的巴呜等等。马头琴是蒙古游唱诗人用来伴奏的乐器；巴呜是一种芦管或竹管做的乐器，吹奏时很像横笛，这种乐器在苗族也很流行，有很多巴呜的独奏曲，音色譿厚而深远，非常动听，人们舞蹈的时候常常用它来伴奏，或者借以倾吐爱情。（成都乐器厂　刘鹤云）七眩琴编　钟排　箫芦笙（苗族）（附图片）
