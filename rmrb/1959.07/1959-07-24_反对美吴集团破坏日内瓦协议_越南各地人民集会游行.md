Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 21st: During "Vietnam Day," rallies and marches against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's sabotage of the Geneva Accords and demanding the reunification of the fatherland are sweeping across North Vietnam. As of July 21st, nearly two million people had participated in protest rallies and marches, from the capital Hanoi to the northwestern mountainous regions, from Lao Cai on the Vietnam-China border to Vinh Linh, near the 17th parallel.

Following the 150,000-person rally and march in Hanoi on the 19th, 50,000 people in Haiphong held a rally and march on the evening of the 20th.

The grand rally in Nam Dinh City, North Vietnam's textile industrial center, on the 20th was unprecedented. More than 60,000 people and cadres had already gathered in the assembly square by four o'clock in the morning, shouting slogans such as "U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam immediately!" "Chop off the claws of U.S. imperialism!" "The Geneva Accords must be respected and thoroughly implemented!" The slogans resonated throughout the city.

That morning, female workers from the Nam Dinh Textile Factory put forward slogans such as "Increase production by a thousand bolts of cloth for our compatriots in South Vietnam" and "Spinning one more spindle of yarn is like giving the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique a blow to the head." The factory's mass production competition movement is surging. In Nghe An, Yen Bai, and Thuan Chau, representatives of tens of thousands of people from the Thai, Miao, Tho, and Chinese communities at the rallies denounced the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's crimes of persecuting ethnic minorities in central South Vietnam, demanding that the International Commission investigate a series of incidents in which the South Vietnamese authorities persecuted ethnic minorities, and demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities guarantee the basic human rights of ethnic minorities in South Vietnam.

In the Hong Quang and Cam Pha mining areas and the Thai Nguyen Iron and Steel Plant construction site, tens of thousands of workers were in high spirits. Under the slogan of "Turn grief and indignation into action," workers spontaneously launched a high tide of voluntary labor production.

In Vinh Linh City, near the provisional military demarcation line, streams of demonstration marches have been continuous in recent days. In order to encourage and support the South Vietnamese people in the southern section of the provisional military demarcation line, the people of Vinh Linh have installed a batch of loudspeakers along the Ben Hai River, broadcasting news of the heated protest activities in various parts of North Vietnam day and night to the people on the south bank.

    反对美吴集团破坏日内瓦协议
    越南各地人民集会游行
    新华社河内21日电　在“越南日”期间，全越南北方反对美国—吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议、要求统一祖国的集会和游行风起云涌。到21日为止，从首都河内到西北山区，从越南中国边境的老街到靠近十七度线的永灵，有将近两百万人参加了抗议集会的游行。
    继河内19日十五万人的大会和游行之后，海防五万人民在20日晚上举行集会和游行。
    北越的纺织工业城——南定市20日的大集会盛况空前。六万多人民和干部在清早四点钟就已经汇集到大会广场，人们高呼：“美帝国主义立即滚出南越！”“斩断美帝国主义的魔掌！”“日内瓦协议必须得到尊重和彻底履行。”口号声振撼了整个市区。
    当天早上，南定纺织厂女工提出了“为了南越同胞增产千匹布”、“多纺一锭纱就是多给美国—吴庭艳集团当头一棒”等口号。这个厂的群众性生产竞赛运动正在高涨中。在义安、安沛、顺州成千上万的泰、苗、倽、土族人民和华侨的代表在集会上控诉美国—吴庭艳集团迫害南越中部少数民族的罪行，要求国际委员会调查南越当局一系列的迫害少数民族人民的事件，要求南越当局保证南越少数民族人民的基本人权。
    在鸿广、锦普矿区和太原钢铁厂建设工地，成千上万的工人情绪很激昂。在“化悲愤为行动”的口号下，工人自动掀起了义务劳动生产的高潮。
    在靠近临时军事分界线的永灵市，几天来示威游行的队伍络绎不绝。为了鼓舞和支援临时军事分界线南段的南越人民，永灵人民沿着边海河一带安上了一批播音器，日夜不停地把几天来北越各地热火朝天的抗议活动的消息传播给南岸的人民。（附图片）
