Supporting the Coal Industry to Mine More and Better Coal
Shanghai Adjusts Forces to Rush-Produce Coal Mining Equipment

(According to a report in the *Liberation Daily*) In order to support the coal industry in mining more and better coal, Shanghai's machinery industry, under the specific leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, has taken emergency measures to elevate the task of manufacturing coal mining equipment to a primary position, ensuring timely, high-quality, sufficient, and complete supply.

Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai's machinery industry departments have undertaken the manufacturing of over 15,000 tons of coal mining equipment to support the whole country and various provinces in East China. Two-thirds of this equipment is heavy machinery, and many products are new products that have never been produced before. Although there have been many difficulties in manufacturing, relevant departments have attached great importance to this task. The municipal materials supply departments and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Machinery Industry have made every effort to procure materials and meet the needs of manufacturing this equipment, even with relatively tight raw material supplies. In addition to actively using inventory materials, the manufacturing plants have also tried to find substitute materials to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. In terms of production arrangements, they have also focused on this as a priority. In addition, relevant units under the Metallurgical Bureau and the Chemical Industry Bureau have also provided active support in the processing of certain collaborative parts and accessories. Therefore, by the end of June, one-third of the total task of coal mining equipment, approximately 5,000 tons, had been completed. Many products, such as the 1.2-meter windlass and forging drills produced by the Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory, and the multi-stage pumps produced by the Zhongguan Machinery Factory and the No. 1 Water Pump Factory, have played a certain role in supporting coal production throughout the country, especially in the six provinces of East China.

Recently, in order to urge the machinery industry departments to further improve the production of coal mining equipment, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately instructed the Municipal Bureau of Machinery Industry to conduct a comprehensive and thorough inspection of the production status of the equipment ordered by the coal industry departments, item by item and piece by piece; and to quickly adjust and arrange the production of equipment that was improperly arranged or not arranged. Under the leadership of the Municipal Committee, the Bureau of Machinery Industry convened three meetings of factory directors and company managers in late June. Based on summarizing and inspecting the production of coal mining equipment in the first half of the year, it reorganized its forces and made a comprehensive deployment for the remaining two-thirds of the task, deciding to make this task a priority in the third quarter; at the same time, it further studied production arrangements, material supply, coordination of collaborative parts, and other production issues, striving to ensure that every item is implemented and every piece is reliable.

The characteristics of the coal mining equipment tasks in the second half of the year are: there are more new products and large, heavy, precision, and special products than in the first half of the year. However, after understanding the importance and urgency of the tasks, all relevant factories have mustered greater efforts to strive to complete most of the tasks in the third quarter. At present, many new and special products, such as the 2.5-meter windlass of the Mining Machinery Factory, the 2-meter windlass of the Metallurgical Mining Machinery Factory, the 1.8-meter and 1.2-meter mine axial flow fans, the scraper conveyors of the Zhonghua Shipyard, and the sand pumps of the Huachang Machinery Factory, have been successively put into trial production or production.

    支援煤炭工业多采煤采好煤
    上海调整力量赶制采煤设备
    据解放日报消息　为了支援煤炭工业多采煤、采好煤，上海市机械工业在中共上海市委的具体领导下，采取紧急措施，把采煤设备制造任务提到首要的地位，保证按时、按质、按量和成套地供应。
    上海市机械工业部门今年以来，承制了支援全国和华东各省的采煤设备共计一万五千多吨，其中有三分之二是重型机械，而且许多产品都是过去从未生产过的新产品。虽然制造中困难很多，但有关部门对这个任务都相当重视。市物资供应部门和上海市机械工业局在原材料供应比较紧张的情况下，千方百计筹措材料，满足制造这批设备的需要。各承制厂除积极以库存材料垫用外，还设法找寻代用材料，来解决某些原材料不足的困难。在生产安排上也都以此为重点，优先突击。另外，冶金局和化工局所属有关单位在某些协作件和配件的加工方面，也给予积极的支持。因此，到6月底，已完成了采煤设备总任务的三分之一，共约五千吨左右，有不少产品都按原定计划提前完成。如上海矿山机器厂生产的一点二米卷扬机和锻钎机，中冠机器厂和第一水泵厂生产的多级泵等等，对支援全国各地特别是华东六省的煤炭生产，起了一定的作用。
    最近，中共上海市委为了督促机械工业部门进一步搞好采煤设备生产，立即责成市机械工业局对煤炭工业部门所订设备的生产情况，逐项逐件地进行全面彻底的检查；对于安排不当或未作安排的设备，迅速调整和安排生产。在市委的领导下，机械工业局在6月下旬接连召开了三次厂长和公司经理会议，在总结、检查了上半年生产采煤设备情况的基础上，重新组织力量，对尚未完成的三分之二的任务作了全面的部署，决定在三季度内把这一任务作为首要任务；同时进一步研究了生产安排、材料供应、协作件配合和生产上的其他问题，务求做到项项落实、件件可靠。
    下半年采煤设备任务的特点是：新产品和大型、重型、精密、特殊产品，数量比上半年更多。但有关各厂在明白了任务的重要性和迫切性以后，都鼓足更大的干劲，争取把大部分任务在三季度内突击完成。现在，许多新产品和特殊产品，例如矿山机器厂的二点五米卷扬机、冶金矿山机械厂的二米卷扬机、一点八米和一点二米矿井轴流风机、中华造船厂的刮板运输机、华昌机器厂的砂泵等等，都已陆续开始试制或投入生产。（附图片）
