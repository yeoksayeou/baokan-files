    Advanced Fire-Stoking Method
    The cooks in the canteen of the Xi'an Dongfeng Textile and Dyeing Factory have summarized a set of advanced fire-stoking methods, which greatly reduces coal consumption. In the past, this canteen used an average of 1.125 jin of coal per person per day, but now it has been reduced to 0.5 jin.
    Their experience is:
    I. When using coal, first select coal lumps for starting the fire and when rapid heat is needed. Use unburnt coal residue as the base for starting the fire. Mix 7% to 10% water into the coal. First use lump coal, and after the fire is strong, use coal dust.
    II. Watch the fire and add coal frequently but in small amounts. Do not add coal when the flames are just starting and the fire is blackish-red, or when the flames are strong and the fire is whitish-red. When the flame changes from white to blue, add coal appropriately. When the firepower is normal, add coal every two to three minutes.
    III. When steaming馒头(mantou), use rapid heat before the steam rises, and mix coal ash into the coal after the steam rises. When cooking noodles, burn lump coal when the water boils and when the noodles are first added. After the water boils and the noodles are added, mix in coal ash.
    IV. Clean out the air vent and flush out the smoke vent once a week to maintain good ventilation and fire. Also, build an arc-shaped "fire-concentrating platform" at the bottom of the stove to concentrate the firepower.

    先进烧火法
    西安东风染织厂食堂的炊事员总结出一套先进烧火方法，大大降低了耗煤量。这个食堂过去每人每天平均用煤一斤一两，现在降低到八两。
    他们的经验是：
    一，用煤时，先挑出煤块，作生火和需急火时用，用没有烧透的乏煤作生火衬底，在煤中掺水7％至10％，先用块煤，火旺后再用煤末。
    二，看火添煤、勤添少添。在火苗初起火色黑红，和火苗正旺火色白红时，不添煤。火苗由白转蓝时，再适当添煤。火力正常，每隔二、三分钟添一次。
    三，蒸馒头的时候，蒸汽没有上升前用急火，蒸汽上升后煤中拌煤灰烧。煮面条时，在水沸和刚下入面条时，烧煤块，水沸和下面条后，掺用煤灰。
    四，每周掏风洞和冲刷烟洞一次，保持通风利火，并给灶底修弧形“拢火台”，使火力集中。
