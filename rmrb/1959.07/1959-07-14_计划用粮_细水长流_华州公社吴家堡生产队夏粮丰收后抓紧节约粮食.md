Plan Grain Usage Carefully, Conserve for the Long Term
    Wujiabao Production Team of Huazhou Commune Intensifies Grain Conservation After Summer Grain Harvest

According to the *Shaanxi Daily* news, the Wujiabao Production Team of Xinglin Management District, Huazhou Commune, Weinan, Shaanxi Province, unified ideological understanding through discussions. The whole team has shown a new atmosphere of everyone participating, everyone saving, planning grain usage, conserving for the long term, and practicing diligence and thrift.

After the summer harvest, some members of the team thought that this year's summer grain had a bumper harvest, and it didn't matter if they ate a little more. Therefore, some phenomena of not paying attention to saving food occurred.

The Party branch of the production team discovered this situation and believed that it was necessary to strengthen leadership over grain usage planning and pay attention to saving food to avoid waste. They immediately convened a forum of experts in diligence and thrift, model figures in grain conservation, and experienced elderly people. At the meeting, everyone exchanged various experiences in saving grain while eating well and filling their stomachs.

In order to quickly implement the methods proposed by everyone at the forum to the masses, the meeting summarized four points: (1) The branch secretary and production team leader should strengthen leadership, Party members, League members, and cadres should all take action to automatically set good grain conservation plans; and help other masses set good grain conservation plans.

(2) Take the squad as a unit, hold three forums a month for grain conservation models and experts in diligence and thrift to exchange experiences and establish role models for diligence and thrift. (3) Commend good people and deeds in grain conservation and criticize wasteful grain behavior. (4) Each squad should formulate a grain conservation plan and launch a grain conservation competition comparing plans, arrangements, conservation methods, and results and achievements.

By June 26, ninety-three of the one hundred and seventy-one households in the four squads of the team had formulated grain conservation pledges.

    计划用粮　细水长流
    华州公社吴家堡生产队夏粮丰收后抓紧节约粮食
  　据陕西日报消息　陕西省渭南华州公社杏林管理区吴家堡生产队，通过座谈，统一了思想认识，全队出现一个人人动手，个个节约，计划用粮，细水长流，勤俭持家的新风气。
    夏收以后，这个队有的社员认为，今年夏粮大丰收，多吃点没啥关系，因此，发生了一些不注意节约粮食的现象。
    生产队党支部发现这种情况，认为，一定要加强对于用粮计划的领导，注意节约粮食，不能浪费。他们随即召集了勤俭持家能手、节约粮食的模范人物和有经验的老年人举行座谈。会上，大家交流了各种吃得省吃得饱的节约粮食的经验。
    为了把座谈会上大家提出的办法迅速贯彻到群众中去，会上总结出了四条：（一）支部书记和生产队长加强领导，党团员、干部齐动手，自动订好节约用粮计划；并帮助其他群众订好节约用粮计划。
  （二）以小队为单位，每月召开三次节约粮食模范和勤俭持家能手座谈会，交流经验，树立勤俭持家的榜样。（三）表扬节约粮食的好人好事，批评浪费粮食的行为。（四）个个小队订出节约粮食计划，掀起一个比计划、看安排，比节约、看方法，比效果、看成绩的节约粮食竞赛。
    到6月26日，全队四个小队共一百七十一户已有九十三户订出了节约用粮的公约。
