    Novel and Adorable Picture Book for Young Children: "Count and See"
    Huang Biyun
    Helping young children understand the relationship between numbers and quantities, and forming children's initial concept of numbers, plays an important role in developing children's intelligence. When children come into contact with their surrounding environment, their understanding of the quantity of things, the length of time, etc., all comes from the accumulation and development of the concept of numbers. However, number itself is a very abstract concept. Preschool children's concept of number has an intuitive nature. Their understanding of numbers is related to the shape, size, and spatial relationship of objects. Therefore, intuitive picture books are often good teaching materials. "Count and See," published by the China Children's Publishing House, is a good reading material to help young children learn numbers from 1 to 10. This book is designed to be novel and adorable. It uses common things in life and colorful and beautiful pictures to express each specific number and the relationship between numbers, so that children can understand the concept of specific numbers and master the arrangement, calculation of each number and the order of numbers. For example, in the book about the number "4", the picture shows four tractors, four cute little drivers, and below are four small squares of different colors, and four small dots, next to a large colorful number "4". Each other number is expressed in an interesting and diverse picture, so that children can associate the concept of number with concrete images, which is easy to understand and remember. The addition part that teaches children to count in order and calculate is also designed with lively and interesting pictures. It enables children to know that each new number counted in order is composed of the previous number plus one.
    Because each picture is organically connected, adults can tell children stories based on the content of each picture, and children will also be inspired by the pictures. It can also enable children to correctly grasp geometric shapes such as squares, circles, triangles, and quadrilaterals, and distinguish basic colors such as red, yellow, blue, and green.

    新颖可爱的幼儿画册“数数看看”
    黄碧云
    帮助幼童领会数和数的关系，形成儿童最初步的数的观念，对发展儿童的智力，有重要的作用。孩子在接触周围环境时，对事物的多少、时间的长短等等的认识，都是从数的观念的蓄积和发展来的。但数本身是一个很抽象的概念，学前儿童对数的概念是含有直觉性质的，他们对数的领悟是跟物体形状、大小和空间的关系等联系在一起的。因此直观的图画书往往是很好的教材。中国少年儿童出版社出版的“数数看看”就是一本帮助幼儿学习从1至10以内数字的好读物。这本书设计得新颖可爱，用生活中常见的事物，以色彩鲜妍、形象美丽的图画来表达每一个具体的数字和数的关系，使孩子从中领悟具体数字的概念，掌握每一个数目和数的顺序的排列、计算。如书中关于“4”的数目，画面上是四台拖拉机，四个可爱的小司机，下面是四块不同颜色的小方块，还有四个小圆点，旁边有一个彩色的大“4”字。其他每个数都用有趣而多样的画来集中表达，使孩子对数的概念和具体形象联系起来，易于领悟和记忆。关于教孩子按顺序数数和计算的加法部分，也同样是以生动有趣的画面来设计的。它能使孩子们知道每一个按顺序数下去的新数是由前一个数加一构成的。
    因为每幅图画都有机地联系在一起，大人可以根据每幅画的内容，像讲短故事一样讲给孩子听，孩子也会从画面上得到启发。其他还能使孩子正确地掌握方、圆、三角、四方形等几何形状，分辨红、黄、蓝、绿等基本颜色。
