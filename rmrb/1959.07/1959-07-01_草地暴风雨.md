    Grassland Storm
    Dun Xingyun
    We finally crossed the snow-capped mountains and joined forces with the Fourth Front Army in Ganzi. In July 1936, we marched into the grasslands again. Our 6th Division, 16th Regiment, still had the task of guarding the rear and taking in stragglers.
    After marching in the grasslands for over a month, more and more comrades from the Second and Fourth Front Armies were falling behind. The number of casualties and sick people we took in greatly exceeded the original number of the entire regiment, while the number of healthy soldiers in the regiment was dwindling. The food we had prepared before entering the grasslands had long been eaten up, and even edible wild vegetables and grasses were gone. The troops who had passed ahead had dug up and eaten even the grass roots, and comrades were collapsing from hunger and illness along the way.
    One afternoon, the troops crossed a small river and walked forward in the rotten mud grassland, stepping on grass mounds, sometimes sinking deep, sometimes not. All the livestock were loaded with the wounded and sick. The animals often stepped on air and sank into the mud. The soldiers had to catch their breath to pull the animals out.
    By afternoon, the comrades were exhausted, and it was difficult to take even one step. The wounded were cold and hungry.
    Suddenly, the troops in front stopped. Everyone thought it was time to camp. Looking up, we saw a low mountain blocking the way. I hurried to the front. I saw a group of soldiers surrounding a person on the hillside grassland. It was Commander He Bingyan, who habitually hung the mule's reins on his amputated shoulder. He was waving his arm up and down, talking vigorously with the soldiers. When the commander saw me, he grabbed my arm and said with a smile:
    "Once we cross this mountain, we'll be out of the grasslands. There's a campsite on the other side of the mountain. There's a village where we can get a meal!"
    Then Commander He said:
    "Commander-in-chief He and Political Commissar Guan saw that the troops ahead were short of food, and they thought you would be even more miserable, so they told us to send someone ahead to get food specifically for your rear guard regiment. Political Commissar Liao has already gone ahead. I'm here waiting for you."
    I held Commander's He's only arm tightly, feeling that he was already skin and bones. I thought to myself that the leaders were suffering from hunger just like us, yet they were still so concerned about us. I couldn't say a word.
    The regimental headquarters called a meeting of the branch secretaries of each company and told every wounded and sick soldier and every comrade in the regiment about Commander-in-chief He's and Political Commissar Guan's concern for the troops and the news that the division leaders were personally raising food for the rear guard regiment. It was also decided that before going up the mountain, we would wait for the stragglers and let the troops rest first, do a good job of organizing, and not leave a single wounded or sick soldier behind.
    The troops were scattered on the hillside. After the branch secretaries of each company finished speaking, the comrades' big, dark eye sockets shone with ecstatic brilliance. The comrades took advantage of the break to search for wild vegetables all over the mountains and fields. Regimental Political Commissar Tang Chenggong, who was tall, was hoarse from exhaustion, but he was still singing the small tune of his Honghu hometown and Hunan mountain songs loudly with the Party members and Youth League members there.
    The sun shone on the grassland, and the sky was particularly bright. The bare loess mountain lying in front of us looked like a carrying pole. It wasn't too high, about four or five li. We were about to climb the mountain. The cadres organized mutual aid work, arranged the order of the comrades being carried by the livestock, and arranged for the comrades who could walk to pull the mules' tails over the mountain. The strong people also found people who needed help.
    In the evening, the main force began to climb the mountain. Reaching the top of the mountain, we saw the roofs of houses peeking out from the trees in the distant mountain depression, and we vaguely heard people shouting and dogs barking. The comrades were so happy that they threw away the dry firewood they had picked up along the way, eager to fly to the campsite immediately. However, they were hungry and weak from illness, taking one step and gasping three times, moving forward like crawling ants. Everyone was walking happily and tiredly when suddenly a black curtain rose from the northwest, the weather changed abruptly, and dark clouds covered the top. Before we had time to hide, a strong wind rose and torrential rain poured down.
    The wind was spinning and howling on the top of the mountain, and hailstones the size of teacups were falling with a crackling sound. The mountain was slippery, the wind was blowing so hard that people couldn't open their eyes, couldn't breathe, and couldn't stand still. The comrades quickly climbed into tree stumps and mountain hollows to hide. Chen Youcai, the head of the regimental health team, and Qi Wa, the platoon leader of the guard platoon, quickly set up a small tent they were carrying under a big tree. More than a dozen of us quickly moved under the tree and sat tightly in the tent. Hail mixed with rain was still falling non-stop, and our clothes were soaked. Our bodies, which had been hungry for a long time, couldn't resist the cold. Qi Wa climbed outside, picked up some wet branches, and started a fire, summoning the comrades who were struggling in the dark wind and rain. We also filled teacups with the rain and snow from the tent, and stewed the remaining chili powder and a little ginger together, preparing to give it to the comrades we rescued.
    Then, a dozen of us walked out of the tent again, looking for our comrades who had been blown away by the wind in the wind, rain, hail, thunder, and lightning.
    We carried dozens of wounded and sick soldiers back to the tent, one by one. They were chattering their teeth from the cold; some were howling "woo-woo-"; some were unconscious. After being carried to the fire and drinking some ginger soup, they gradually regained their energy.
    The people who had just warmed up and awakened struggled to crawl out of the tent again and joined us in braving the danger to slip down the mountain to look for the comrades in distress.
    The strong wind continued to blow, and the rain, snow, and hail continued to fall, but we triumphed in the tenacious struggle against nature and finally rescued most of our comrades.
    The wind stopped, the sky suddenly cleared, and we were about to count the number of people and go down the mountain when we couldn't find Political Commissar Tang. The guard said:
    "Maybe the political commissar went down the mountain first?!"
    "The political commissar would never leave the troops and go down the mountain first!" some comrades retorted him.
    The comrades searched everywhere and shouted, like looking for a needle in a haystack, without a single echo, without a trace.
    The comrades stubbornly hoped, squatted on the ground, groping everywhere. Finally, in a mountain depression, they found a group of people. They said: They all came to take shelter from the wind under the guidance of Political Commissar Tang, and some were even dragged over by the political commissar crawling. When the soldiers heard that the political commissar was lost, they tried their best to stand up and search all over the mountain. Finally, they found him in a mountain depression. He was lying stiff and unconscious, but he was still holding a comrade in his arms. It seemed that he was rescuing a comrade when he ran out of strength and fainted on the ground.
    They carried the political commissar to the tent, put him by the fire to warm him, wiped the white foam from the corner of his mouth, and poured some chili and ginger soup into him. He slowly woke up.
    Just as the sky was beginning to brighten, we saw many people walking on the mountain ridge in front of us. It turned out that the comrades from the division headquarters had come to pick us up. As soon as the wind and rain stopped, they went up the mountain to look for us, and it was only then that they found us. We also learned that when the storm started, Commander He and his mule had been blown down the mountain and fainted for a long time. When he woke up, he found the village and urged the division headquarters to send people up the mountain to look for us.
    Everyone asked in surprise:
    "Is the commander alright?"
    The comrades from the division headquarters comforted us and said:
    "The commander is fine. He told you to go forward, and you will be victorious!"
    The sun rose, the top of the mountain was exceptionally quiet, and a golden road spread out on the mountain ridge. We reorganized our ranks and continued to move forward!

    草地暴风雨
    顿星云
    我们终于跨过雪山，在甘孜同四方面军会合了。1936年7月间，又向草地进军。我们6师16团仍然担负后卫和收容任务。
    在草地走了一个多月，二、四两个方面军掉队的同志越来越多，收容下来的伤病员，大大超过了全团原来人数，而团里健康的战士却越来越少了。进草地前准备的粮食，早已吃光，连可以吃的野菜、野草也都没有了。前面走过的部队，连草根都挖掘出来吃了，沿途都有饿倒、病倒的同志。
    一天午后，部队越过一条小河，在烂泥草地里，深一脚、浅一脚，踏着草墩子向前走。所有牲口都驮满了伤病员，牲口常常一脚踩空，陷进污泥里，战士们不得不喘着气，把牲口救起来。
    这样到了下午，同志们个个筋疲力竭，跨上一步都感到十分困难，伤员也又冷又饿。
    忽然前面的部队停了下来，大家还以为要宿营了呢；抬头一望，原来是一抹矮山挡住去路。我连忙赶到前头去。只见山坡草地上，一群战士围着一个人，那是贺炳炎师长，他习惯地把骡子缰绳挂在断臂的肩头上。胳膊上下挥动，正站在那里跟战士们起劲地谈着。师长见了我一把捞起我的胳膊笑着说道：
    “翻过这座山，就出了大草地，山那面是宿营地，有村子，可以搞顿饭吃了！”
    接着贺师长又说：
    “贺总和关政委看到前边部队缺粮，想到你们会更苦，所以叫我们派人到前面专门给你们后卫团搞粮食，廖政委已经到前头去了，我就在这里等你们。”
    我紧抓住师长那条独臂，只觉着他已是骨瘦如柴。心想，首长们也跟我们一样挨着饿，还这样关心我们，一时更加说不出话来。
    团部召集各连支部书记开会，把贺总、关政委对部队的关心，师首长亲自为后卫团筹粮的消息，告诉每个伤病员和全团同志。并决定上山之前，一面等掉队的同志，一面让部队先休息，做好组织工作，不许丢下一个伤病员。
    部队散在山坡上，各连的支部书记讲完话之后，同志们个个又大又黑的眼眶里，闪射着狂喜的光辉。同志们利用休息的机会，满山遍野去找野菜。团政委汤成功同志个头高高的，虽然筋疲力竭，还在和那里的党员、团员们，哑着嗓子，大声唱着洪湖家乡小调，湖南山歌。
    太阳照在草地上，天空格外明亮。眼前躺着的黄土秃山，看去像根扁担，不算太高，大约有四、五里路。快要爬山了。干部们组织好了互助工作，把用牲口驮的同志，编好了顺序，安排能走动的同志，拽着骡子尾巴过山。坚壮的人也都找好了需要帮助的对象。
    傍晚大队开始爬山了。爬到山顶，看见远处山凹里的树丛中露出了屋顶，隐约听见人喊狗叫。这下同志们可高兴起来，把沿途拾来的干柴火都扔掉了，恨不得马上飞到宿营地。但是，久饿病弱，拖一步，歇三气，行进得婉如爬行的蚂蚁一般。大家正高兴而又疲劳地走着，忽然从西北方向漫起了黑幕，天气骤变，乌云盖顶。我们还没有来得及躲避，就狂风大作，暴雨倾泻。
    风在山顶旋转、嚎叫着，茶盅大的冰雹子，噼里叭啦砸下来。山上溜滑，风吹得人睁不开眼，喘不上气，站不住脚。同志们都赶紧爬到树楂子里、山窝窝里躲起来，团部卫生队长陈友才和警卫排长齐娃，把随身带着的一个小帐篷，连忙在一棵大树下支了起来。我们十几个人赶紧搬到树底下，紧贴着坐在帐篷里。冰雹夹着雨水，仍是下个不停，衣服湿透了。久饿的身子抗不住寒冷。齐娃爬到外面，拣回一些湿树枝，生起一堆火来，召唤在黑暗风雨里挣扎的同志。我们又用茶缸子接满帐篷上的雨雪，把剩下的辣椒粉和一点生姜，放在一起炖着，准备给抢救回来的同志喝。
    接着，我们十几个同志，又走出帐篷，在风雨、冰雹、炸雷、闪电中寻找被狂风卷走了的战友。
    我们一个、两个……，一直背回帐篷几十个伤病员。他们冻得直磕牙齿；有的“呜—呜—”叫唤；有的昏睡不醒。等抬到火堆旁，喝了点姜汤，才渐渐有了生气。
    刚刚暖和苏醒过来的人，又挣扎着爬出帐篷，同我们一起冒着危险滑下山窝去寻找被难的同志。
    狂风继续刮着，雨雪冰雹继续下着，但是我们在顽强地同大自然搏斗中胜利了，终于救出了大部分同志。
    风停了，天骤然转晴了，我们正准备清点人数下山时，却不见了汤政委。警卫员说：
    “政委也许先下山了？！”
      “政委绝不会甩开部队先下山的！”有的同志反驳他。
    同志们四处寻找，喊叫，就像海底捞针一样，没有一点回声，没有一丝踪影。
    同志们顽强地希望着，蹲在地上四处摸找，最后，在一个山洼洼里，发现了一堆人，他们说：都是汤政委指引着来避风的，有的还是政委爬着拖来的，战士们听说丢失了政委，一个个竭尽全力，站起来，满山寻找。到底在一个山洼里找到了，他已经僵卧不醒，但怀里还抱着一个同志。看来，他是援救同志，中途气力不支，晕倒在地下的。
    把政委抬到帐篷里来，放在火边烤着，擦去他嘴边的白沫，灌下些辣椒、姜汤，才慢慢地苏醒过来。
    天刚蒙蒙亮，看见前面山梁上走来许多人，原来是师部的同志来接我们了。风雨一停，他们便上山寻找，直到这时，才找到我们。我们也才知道，贺师长在暴风刮起的时候，连人带骡子被刮倒摔下了山，晕倒过去许久，醒来后，摸到村子里，便催师部派人上山寻找我们。
    大家惊问起来：
      “师长要紧不？”
    师部的同志安慰我们说：
      “师长很好。他叫转告你们，走过去，便是胜利！”
    太阳升起来了，山顶上分外宁静，山梁上铺开了一条金色的大路，我们整顿好队伍，继续前进！
