We must resolutely implement the Party's principles and policies under the leadership of the Party and follow the mass line in order to do any work well. There are many ways to follow the mass line. The most important one is to listen to the masses in many ways. That is, consult with the masses in everything we do, come from the masses and go to the masses. Listening to the masses means first of all respecting their opinions, but also adopting an attitude of analysis and research, so that we can concentrate them and implement them. Zhang Xueqing, the Party branch secretary of the Fifth Workshop of the Qingdao Cigarette Factory, after realizing the importance of relying on the masses to do a good job, adopted the method of listening to the masses, such as holding "Zhuge Liang Meetings" to pool the wisdom of the masses and summarize a "rapid ink spreading and water leveling method", which was promoted and improved the quality and quantity of printing.

At the same time, Zhang Xueqing listened not only to the experienced or advanced workers, but also to the opinions of the so-called "backward" masses. The branch committee studied these opinions and stipulated a method for discussing the plan. This encouraged the workers and ensured the realization of the plan. This practice of being good at listening to the opinions of the masses can be used as a reference for grassroots Party organizations and grassroots cadres. (Attached picture)

    同群众商量
    我们作好任何一件工作，都必须要在党的领导下坚决贯彻党的方针政策，走好群众路线。走群众路线的方法是多种多样的。最主要的
  一条是，多方面地听群众的话。也就是遇事同群众商量，从群众中来到群众中去。听群众的话，首先要尊重群众的意见，同时要采取分析研究的态度，才能集中起来贯彻下去。青岛卷烟厂第五车间支部书记张学清，认识了依靠群众做好工作的重要意义以后，就采取了听群众的话的办法，如开“诸葛亮会”，集中群众的智慧，总结了一个“摆墨匀水快速操作法”，加以推广，提高了印刷的质量数量。
    同时，张学清既听有经验的或者先进的工人群众的话，也听所谓“落后”群众的意见。支委会对这些意见作了研究，规定了讨论计划的作法。这样，鼓励了工人，保证了计划的实现。这种善于听取群众意见的作法，可以提供基层党组织和基层干部作为参考。（附图片）
