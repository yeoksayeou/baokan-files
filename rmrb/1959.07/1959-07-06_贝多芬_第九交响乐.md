Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony," also known as the "Choral Symphony," by the great German musician Beethoven, was first performed in Vienna in 1824 (three years before Beethoven's death). It is Beethoven's last symphony and is widely regarded as the culmination of his creative life and the pinnacle of European classical music. To this day, symphony orchestras in many countries around the world consider being able to perform this work as a sign of their level of performance.

This symphony was written by Beethoven when he was completely deaf. Beethoven, whose musical cultivation had reached a state of "divine transformation," wrote this masterpiece without any objective feedback or experimentation. Therefore, some say that the Ninth Symphony is not Beethoven's "music of feeling" but his "music of thought."

The main image of this immortal symphony is the movement toward joy through tragic and painful struggle, an ode to human freedom and equality, and sincere love. Its conception is profound, and its structure is unprecedentedly vast and complex. It is divided into four movements. The fourth movement focuses on expressing the idea of freedom, equality, and fraternity among "all men shall be brothers," and uses Schiller's famous poem "Ode to Joy" as the choral lyrics, forming the climax of the symphony. In order to fully express his magnificent thought, Beethoven added a large chorus to the symphony for the first time, intertwining human voices and orchestral sounds.

In his speech at the commemorative meeting for the 125th anniversary of Beethoven's death (1952), Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, said: "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is the work of the most outstanding and heroic revolutionary artist in the world. It foretells the happy future of mankind, and it is full of bold courage and the fighting spirit of equality for all mankind. This is exactly what the revolutionary utopians of the first half of the nineteenth century dreamed of."

For more than 130 years since its birth, the Ninth Symphony has gradually become world music. In 1936, at the solemn moment when the Soviet Union passed the Stalin Constitution, the "Ninth Symphony" was grandly performed in Moscow. This symphony was also played on the historic day of the founding of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Beethoven's ideal of "millions of people united as brothers" is gradually becoming a reality today.

### 贝多芬“第九交响乐”

    贝多芬“第九交响乐”
    德国伟大音乐家贝多芬“第九交响乐”也称“合唱交响乐”。1824年（贝多芬逝世前三年）首次在维也纳演出。它是贝多芬最后一部交响乐，被公认为是他的创作生活的总结和欧洲古典音乐的高峰。至今世界许多国家的交响乐队都以能够演奏这个作品作为自己演奏水平的一种标志。
    这部交响乐是贝多芬在两耳完全聋了的情况下写成的。在音乐修养方面已经达到“出神入化”境地的贝多芬，完全不要客观的反响和实验，就写出了这部巨著。因此，有人说，第九交响乐不是贝多芬“感觉的音乐”，而是他“思想的音乐”。
    这部不朽的交响乐的主要形象是通过悲剧性的痛苦斗争走向欢乐，是对人类自由平等、真诚相爱的颂歌。它构思的深远，结构的庞大、复杂是前所未有的。它共分四个乐章。第四乐章集中表现了“四海之内皆兄弟”的自由、平等、博爱的思想，并且以席勒的名诗“欢乐颂”作为合唱歌词，构成了交响乐的高潮。贝多芬为了充分表达出他这种宏伟的思想，第一次在交响乐演奏中加进了大合唱，把人声和管弦乐声交织在一起。
    德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克在贝多芬逝世一百二十五周年（1952年）纪念大会的演说中讲道：“贝多芬的第九交响乐是属于全世界的最杰出、最英雄的革命艺术家的作品。它预言着人类幸福的将来，它富有豪放的勇敢和全人类平等的斗争性思想。这正是十九世纪前半叶的革命乌托邦者所梦想的。”
   第九交响乐诞生一百三十多年以来，逐渐形成为世界性的音乐。1936年苏联通过斯大林宪法的庄严时刻，在莫斯科隆重演出了“第九交响乐”。在德国统一社会党成立的历史性的日子，也演奏了这部交响乐。贝多芬那种“亿万人民团结成兄弟”的理想，今天正在逐步地变成事实。
