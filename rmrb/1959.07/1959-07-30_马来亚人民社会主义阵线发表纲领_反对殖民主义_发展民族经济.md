Xinhua News Agency, Kuala Lumpur, July 28th: The Malayan People's Socialist Front recently announced its election platform for the Malaya Federation's House of Representatives election. The platform states its opposition to foreign troops stationed in Malaya. It states that Malaya does not want foreign countries to turn it into a military base and a springboard for aggression, as doing so would make it a military target.

The platform, published on the 24th, stated that Malaya is located in the Asia-Africa region and should use the spirit of the Bandung Conference as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. The platform emphasized the party's firm opposition to colonialism.

The Malayan People's Socialist Front is jointly formed by the People's Party and the Labour Party. It has nominated thirty-seven candidates to participate in the Federation's House of Representatives election scheduled for August 19th.

The party advocates an independent and autonomous economic policy, relying on its own capital accumulation to develop the economy, establishing a national bank, guaranteeing farmers' land lease rights, and implementing extensive development plans to solve the serious unemployment problem.

The platform declares that the party will strive to abolish undemocratic regulations such as the "Emergency Ordinance" and the "Public Order (Preservation) Ordinance."

The platform also advocates using Malay as the national language, comprehensively revising the current education policy, and ending the privileged status currently enjoyed by English schools.
