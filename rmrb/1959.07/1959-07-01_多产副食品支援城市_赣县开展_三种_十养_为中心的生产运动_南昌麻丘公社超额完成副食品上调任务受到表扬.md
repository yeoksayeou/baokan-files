This dispatch from Ganzhou, July 30th reports that while focusing on early rice, Ganxian County, Jiangxi Province, is launching a sideline production campaign centered on "three types" (planting vegetables, fruit trees, melons) and "ten raisings" (raising pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, fish, bees, pigeons, cattle, sheep, rabbits).

Ganxian County has mountains and rivers, providing excellent conditions for developing sideline occupations. Over the years, sideline income has accounted for 40% of the total agricultural and sideline income, and even 60% in mountainous areas. Currently, the number of pigs in the county has increased from 58,000 last year to over 110,000; poultry has roughly tripled; 30,000 mu of melons and vegetables have been planted, and 260,000 fruit trees, totaling one and a half times more than the same period last year; fish, rabbits, sheep, cattle, etc., have also increased several times over last year.

Due to the rapid development of sideline occupations, the county not only meets the needs of the masses for non-staple foods but can also support other areas. In May alone, it shipped out 450,000 jin of vegetables, 80,000 jin of vegetable oil, 7,000 pigs, and tens of thousands of chickens and ducks to support urban industries and mines.

This year, the county party committee has paid close attention to sideline production. Each commune has established a sideline production committee, and each production team has established a leading group, personally led by the secretary. In terms of labor arrangement, each commune has drawn about 15% of its labor force to form professional sideline teams, which engage in sideline production year-round, with a total of more than 1,000 professional sideline teams and 20,000 laborers in the county.

In the past, due to improper handling of the relationship between "production, transfer, and self-consumption," "more production leads to more transfer, and less production results in the same amount of self-retention," so commune members with more production were not very motivated to engage in sideline occupations. This year, the communes have implemented the principle of giving equal weight to collective and private raising, and stipulated that in addition to completing the transfer task, the surplus production should be disposed of by the production team and commune members themselves: those who are willing to sell can sell more, and those who do not want to sell can keep it for their own consumption. In the past, Dabu Commune raised very few pigs, and had to supply meat from other places during the New Year and festivals. This year, due to adhering to the principle of walking on two legs, it developed more than 1,700 pigs in April and May alone. At present, the commune can not only meet the needs of commune members' lives, but also transfer 50 pigs to other places every month.

More than 95% of the existing chickens and ducks in the county belong to commune members privately; commune members have privately sown more than 8,000 mu of vegetables, accounting for 40% of the county's existing vegetable area.

Because leaders at all levels have closely relied on the masses, the difficulties of insufficient funds, seed sources, feed, equipment, and labor required for the development of sideline occupations have been solved.

In order to improve the survival rate of livestock and poultry such as pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese, all localities have strengthened the leadership and organization of veterinary work. At present, the county has basically achieved the goal of having an epidemic prevention station in each production brigade and an epidemic prevention worker in each team, and has established a system of diligent inspection, diligent epidemic prevention, and diligent treatment.

The active assistance of commercial departments to communes in overcoming difficulties is an important reason for the rapid rise of sideline production in Ganxian County. For example, in solving the problem of seed sources, commercial departments sent more than a dozen technicians to help communes build hatcheries and pigsties, and taught commune members the technology of hatching and breeding pigs; at the same time, they transferred tens of thousands of chicks and ducklings to supply communes for breeding. In order to help communes sell sideline products in a timely manner, commercial departments have added more than 100 purchasing points this year and carried out large-scale purchasing and sales businesses. Since the beginning of this year, the total amount of small local and sideline products purchased by commercial departments alone has reached 1.5 million yuan, more than double that of the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 30th. The non-staple food production of Maqiu Commune, Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, has greatly developed, and it has overfulfilled the national procurement task for the first half of this year.

Maqiu Commune is located in the suburbs of Nanchang City, near Poyang Lake. Diversified operations and sideline production have always been very good. This year, according to the needs of urban industrial and mining supplies and the commune's original experience and foundation in developing non-staple food production, the state allocated a larger non-staple food production task to them, requiring the commune to deliver more than double the amount of pigs, poultry, fresh eggs, aquatic products, and vegetables to the state throughout the year compared to last year. After accepting this task assigned by the state, the Maqiu Commune Party Committee, in the spirit of striving for a double harvest of agriculture and sideline occupations, organized commune members and cadres in February to discuss how to develop non-staple food production. Through discussions, contracts for fixed raising, fixed purchase, and fixed sales were widely signed between the commune and the production team, and between the production team and the commune members, and the national task was implemented at all levels. After the task was implemented, the commune vigorously carried out non-staple food production in accordance with the principle of "equal emphasis on public and private raising." Now the commune has established a sow breeding farm, a livestock comprehensive farm, and a fish farm. Various brigades and teams have newly built 278 pig, fish, and poultry farms. The commune also vigorously assists commune members in raising poultry and livestock individually. For example, the commune lent the masses 8,900 piglets, and at the same time allocated feed land. Other things such as fertilizer and labor time were also arranged and taken care of according to the principle of putting the public first and the private second.

At present, compared with the end of last year, the production of non-staple foods such as pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, fish, and vegetables in the entire commune has increased: the number of live pigs has increased from 13,000 to 24,000, an increase of 84.6%; the number of various poultry has increased from 190,000 to 230,000, an increase of 21%; the number of fish raised has increased by more than 10 million; and 904 mu of new vegetable land have been opened up. Since the beginning of this year, the four times of transfer tasks assigned to the commune by the state have been overfulfilled. In the first half of the year, the total income from the sale of non-staple foods in the entire commune reached 1.1 million yuan, an average of 91 yuan per household and 22 yuan per person.

The commune has repeatedly been praised by the state for its good non-staple food production and good completion of the national transfer task, and has been rated as a model for non-staple food production and sales in the county. (Song Peiji)

    多产副食品支援城市
    赣县开展“三种”“十养”为中心的生产运动
    南昌麻丘公社超额完成副食品上调任务受到表扬
    本报赣州30日电　江西赣县在抓早稻的同时，开展以“三种”（种蔬菜、果树、瓜类）、“十养”（养猪、鸡、鸭、鹅、鱼、蜂、鸽、牛、羊、兔）为中心的副业生产运动。
    赣县有山有水，发展副业的条件极好；历年来副业收入占农副业总收入的40％，山区甚至占到60％。目前全县生猪已由去年五万八千头增加到十一万多头；家禽大约增长了三倍；种瓜菜三万亩，种果树二十六万株，总计比去年同期增加了一倍半；鱼、兔、羊、牛等比去年也都有成倍增长。
    由于副业的飞跃发展，全县副食品不仅能满足群众生活需要，而且能够支援外地。仅5月份就调运出四十五万斤蔬菜、八万斤植物油、七千头生猪和数万只鸡鸭支援城市工矿。
      今年县委对副业生产抓得较
  紧。各公社都成立了副业生产委员
  会，生产队成立了领导小组，由书记亲自负责。在安排劳动力上，每个公社都抽出15％左右的劳动力组成副业专业队，常年搞副业生产，全县共有一千多个副业专业队、二万个劳动力。
    过去由于“产、调、自吃”三者处理不当，“生产多的多调，生产少的自留也一样多”，因此生产多的社员经营副业积极性不高。今年各公社贯彻公养私养并重的方针，并规定完成上调任务外，多生产的由生产队、社员自己支配：愿卖的多卖，不愿出售的可以自留消费。大埠公社过去养猪很少，过年过节时还要外地供应肉食；今年由于坚持了两条腿走路的方针，仅4、5月份就发展一千七百多头猪。目前该社不仅能满足社员生活需要，每月还能外调五十头生猪。
    全县现有鸡鸭中95％以上属于社员私人所有；社员私人播种的蔬菜有八千多亩，占全县现有蔬菜面积的40％。
    由于各级领导紧紧依靠了群众，解决了发展副业所需的资金、种源、饲料、以及设备和劳力不足的困难。
    为了提高猪、鸡、鸭、鹅等家畜、家禽的成活率，各地都加强了兽医工作的领导与组织。目前全县已基本上达到生产大队有防疫站、小队有防疫员，建立了勤检查、勤防疫、勤治疗的制度。
    商业部门积极协助公社克服困难，是赣县副业生产飞跃上升的一个重要原因。如解决种源方面，商业部门派出十多名技术人员帮助公社兴建孵房、猪舍，向社员传授孵养和种猪交配的技术；同时调运了数万只小鸡小鸭供应公社饲养。商业部门为了帮助公社及时出售副业产品，今年增设了一百多处收购点，开展了大购大销业务。今年以来，商业部门仅收购的小宗土副产品总金额就达一百五十万元，比去年同期多了一倍。（刘光辉、梅国宝、吴渊龙）
    本报南昌30日电　江西省南昌县麻丘公社副食品生产大发展，今年上半年连续超额完成了国家收购任务。
    麻丘公社位于南昌市郊，临近鄱阳湖，多种经营和副业生产历来搞得很好。今年，国家根据城市工矿供应的需要和这个公社原有发展副食品生产的经验和基础，分配给他们的副食品生产任务较大，要求全社全年交售给国家的生猪、家禽、鲜蛋、水产品和蔬菜，都比去年增大了一倍多。中共麻丘公社党委在接受了国家分配的这一任务后，本着力争农业副业双丰收的精神，在2月份便组织社员和干部，就如何发展副食品生产问题进行了讨论。通过讨论广泛地签订了公社与生产队、生产队与社员之间的定养、定购、定销合同，把国家任务层层落实。任务落实后，公社根据“公养私养并重”的方针，大力开展了副食品生产。现在公社建立起了一个母猪繁殖场，一个畜牧综合场，一个养鱼场，各个大队和小队新建了养猪、养鱼、家禽饲养场共二百七十八个。公社还大力协助社员个人饲养家禽家畜。例如，公社贷给群众小猪八千九百只，同时划拨饲料地，其他如肥料、劳动时间等，也都按照先公后私的原则，作了安排和照顾。
    目前，全社猪、鸡、鸭、鹅、鱼、蔬菜等副食品生产与去年年底比较：毛猪由一万三千头增加到二万四千头，增长84.6％；各种家禽由十九万只发展到二十三万只，增加21％；养鱼增加了一千多万尾；新开辟蔬菜地九百零四亩。今年以来，国家分配给该社四次上调任务都超额完成了。上半年，全公社出售副食品收入达一百一十万元，每户平均九十一元，每人平均二十二元。
    这个公社副食品生产好、完成国家上调任务好，曾多次受到国家表扬，并被评为全县副食品生产和交售的模范。　（宋培基）
