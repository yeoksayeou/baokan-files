Prepare Firewood! Prepare Fodder!
Nanyang Prefectural Committee Organizes Forces
Crash Program of Grass Cutting and Active Afforestation

(Henan Daily News) The Nanyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has adopted measures to vigorously mobilize the masses, seize the current favorable opportunity, and launch a crash program to store firewood and fodder. Currently, production teams in some people's communes are actively collecting firewood and grass.

Firewood and grass are essential fuels for the daily life of the masses and fodder for livestock. In the past, due to the limitations of the individual economy, the masses had to spend a lot of labor time and economic expenses to solve the problem of firewood and fodder every year, which greatly affected life and production. In the past two or three years, especially after communization, firewood and grass have increased with the increase in grain production. The widespread establishment of public canteens and the development of collective livestock raising have saved a lot of firewood and fodder. However, due to the large-scale development of livestock, the increase in firewood and grass needed by commune-run industries, the reduction of tall-stalk crops, and the insufficient understanding of the importance of storing firewood and grass by some cadres, the problem of the lack of firewood and grass has not been well resolved due to poor planning and management.

The Nanyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has specifically studied concrete measures to solve the problem of firewood and grass, and decided to grasp both the crash firewood collection and storage campaign and the "basic construction" of firewood and grass, combining short-term arrangements with long-term plans, and combining the broadening of sources with economizing on expenditure. The Prefectural Committee requires people's communes and production teams lacking firewood and grass to make plans for building firewood forests according to their needs and local conditions, assign responsibility by area, and plant by canteen unit, with ownership going to whoever plants the trees. In hilly areas and slopes where crops cannot be planted, unified plans should be formulated and afforestation should be carried out by collective units; at the same time, commune members should be mobilized to plant trees in the vacant spaces beside their houses. When counties and communes allocate crop planting plans, they should try to take local habits into account, plant more tall-stalk crops, and expand the area of multiple cropping, so as to increase firewood and grass income while increasing grain production. At the same time, the Prefectural Committee decided to vigorously mobilize the masses to carry out a firewood storage campaign, requiring commune members with a certain amount of labor to bear a certain amount of firewood collection tasks.

While solving the firewood problem, it is required to make overall plans for livestock fodder, and strengthen the management and storage of fodder. In areas lacking fodder, sufficient fodder must first be reserved to ensure fodder supply.

Now, the people's communes and production teams have actively taken action to solve the problem of firewood and grass by various methods. On the one hand, they are actively planting firewood forests, and on the other hand, they are starting early to collect firewood and cut grass to increase storage. After rationally arranging labor, the "March 8th" production brigade of the Lihe Commune in Nanyang County launched a crash program for five days and collected 510,000 jin of wheat stubble, which is enough for the canteen of this brigade to burn for three months. The Yuanying Production Brigade of the Houji Commune in Zhenping County has planted more than 4,700 locust trees, cultivated more than 10,000 tree seedlings, and collected more than 10 million jin of firewood and grass. At present, the communes and production teams are launching a crash program to collect firewood under the slogan of "not losing a single piece of firewood, every jin goes to the stack", and at the same time actively planting firewood forests.

    准备烧柴！准备饲草！
    南阳地委组织力量
    突击割草积极造林
    河南日报消息　中共南阳地委采取措施，大力发动群众，抓住当前有利时机，突击贮备烧柴和饲草。目前，部分人民公社的生产队正积极打柴拾草。
    柴草是群众生活中必需的燃料和牲畜的饲草。过去由于个体经济的限制，群众每年为解决烧柴、饲草问题，要花费大量的劳动时间和经济开支，大大影响了生活与生产。近两三年来，特别是公社化以后，柴草随着粮食的增产有所增长，公共食堂的普遍建立和集体饲养事业的发展，更节约了大量的烧柴、饲草。但是，由于牲畜的大量发展和社办工业需用柴草的增加，高秆作物的减少，和部分干部对贮存柴草的重要性认识不足，计划安排不周和管理不善，缺乏柴草的问题仍然没有很好解决。
    中共南阳地委曾经专门研究了解决柴草问题的具体措施，决定既抓突击性的拾柴贮草运动，也搞柴草的“基本建设”，把短期安排和长远打算结合起来，把开源和节流结合起来。地委要求缺柴草的人民公社和生产队根据需要，因地制宜的作出造烧柴林的规划，分片包干，以食堂为单位种植，谁种归谁所有。不能种庄稼的岗坡、丘陵地区，制定统盘规划，由集体单位造林；同时发动社员在宅旁空场种树。在县、社分配农作物种植计划时，尽量照顾当地习惯，多种高秆作物，扩大复播面积，在增产粮食的同时，增加柴草收入。与此同时，地委决定大力发动群众开展贮备柴草运动，要求有一定劳力的社员担负一定数量的拾柴任务。
    在解决烧柴问题的同时，要求统筹作好牲畜饲草的规划，加强对饲草的管理和贮存。凡缺饲草的地区，都要首先留足饲草，保证饲草供应。
    现在，各人民公社和生产队已经积极行动起来，采取各种办法，解决柴草问题。一方面积极栽种烧柴林，另一方面及早动手拾柴割草增加贮备。南阳县溧河公社“三八”生产大队合理安排劳力后，突击五天收回麦茬五十一万斤，足够这个大队的食堂烧三个月。镇平县侯集公社袁营生产大队已经栽植洋槐树四千七百多棵，培育树苗一万多株，拾回柴草一千多万斤。目前，各公社生产队正在“一柴不丢，斤两归垛”的口号下突击拾柴，同时积极栽植烧柴林。（附图片）
