Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 22nd: TASS reports that Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, stated at the rally in Warsaw celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Polish People's Republic on the 21st, that the establishment of the Polish People's Republic was not only a turning point in the history of the Polish people. But it is also an event of international significance that plays a major role in the development of world socialism.
	In his speech, Khrushchev spoke in detail about the impressions of the Soviet party and government delegation's visit to Poland and talks with Polish leaders. He said that in the frank talks with Polish leaders, we did not feel that we had any different opinions on the construction of socialism in Poland and communism in the Soviet Union, as well as on international issues. We are once again convinced that we and our Polish friends share a common view on the following extremely important tasks: further strengthening the friendly relations between our two countries, strengthening the unity of our great socialist camp countries, and strengthening unity in the struggle to win peace, eliminate international tension and the "Cold War" to ensure world peace.
	Khrushchev emphasized that the enemies of socialism are trying to alienate Poland from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, but such attempts are futile. He said, however, this does not mean that we can rest easy about the conspiracies of the enemies of peace and socialism. The enemies of socialism have not laid down their arms, and they are still doing everything they can to "roll back" socialism, as they have said in the past and are still saying now. The essence of this policy is to try to weaken socialist countries from within by threatening them with inducements and creating discord between socialist countries, thereby undermining and disintegrating the united socialist camp.
	Khrushchev said that not long ago, those who were keen on the "rollback" policy placed their bets mainly on Hungary and Poland, because they thought that these two countries were the weakest links in the socialist camp. Later, they had to give up the idea of Hungary. However, it seems that they have not given up on Poland so far. They insist that Poland occupies a special position among socialist countries, and they insist that Poland is not a firm example of implementing socialist principles compared with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Therefore, it can be expected to separate Poland from the socialist camp. However, unless you are very, very ignorant of the current situation in Poland and the entire socialist camp, you will not turn to the idea that can make Poland and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries discordant.
	Khrushchev said that, of course, not long ago, there were some factors in the relations between our two countries that allowed the enemy to expect discord between our two countries. We and you regard the past unpleasant things as an episode in the extremely pure relationship between our two parties and countries, as a thin layer of dust. However, for our enemies, this little bit of dust is enough for them to imagine that there is some kind of contradictory reef between the Soviet Union and Poland that they are counting on. They should now understand that there has never been and will never be any contradictions between us. As for the so-called thin layer of dust, the Polish people and the Soviet people can completely blow it away with just one breath.
	Khrushchev went on to say that we are very satisfied with the current relations between us and the Polish People's Republic, with the consistency of views on party issues and ideological issues, and with the consistency of views on the relations between our two countries. There are no differences between our two governments, or different understandings of the issues.
	Whether in solving domestic problems or in solving foreign policy problems, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Polish United Workers' Party proceed from consistent interests, from the standpoint of Marxism-Leninism, from the standpoint of opposing revisionism and opportunism, and from the standpoint of opposing dogmatism. What unites us is also a great and noble goal—to build a bright communist building. Our friendship is eternal and unbreakable forever.
	Khrushchev said that all historical experience has proved that the friendly relations between our two countries have always been beneficial to the people of our two countries. On the contrary, only the enemies of our two countries like disputes in our relations. Anyone who tries to spread discord and distrust between us, whether intentionally or unintentionally, is opposing the fundamental interests of the Polish and Soviet people and helping the enemies of socialism and peace. Khrushchev said that there are undoubtedly some revisionists and opportunists in Poland. They have lost their support, their activities are severely restricted, but of course they still exist. In our country, there are also such elements now, but they can no longer draw nourishing juice and have lost the possibility of coming forward. However, this does not mean that we can relax our attention and struggle against the possible recurrence of past phenomena. We should always be vigilant, ideologically expose and take resolute measures to oppose all manifestations of revisionism and opportunism.
	Khrushchev said that in the international workers' movement, we have fought in the past and will continue to fight against those spies who call themselves communists but are actually implementing policies that undermine Marxism-Leninism and undermine the socialist camp. Our enemies have a correct understanding of these splitters and a correct assessment of their role, so they often encourage them spiritually and materially to carry out destructive activities. We have fought and will continue to fight an irreconcilable struggle for the purity of our ideology and for the purity of Marxism-Leninism. He said that we believe that there is currently an unprecedented ideological consensus in the relations between communist parties and workers' parties in various countries.
	Khrushchev went on to say that our two parties will now and in the future wage an irreconcilable struggle against all kinds of revisionists and against revisionism, because revisionism is the main danger to the cause of Marxism-Leninism. At the same time, we must not forget that we must also wage a resolute struggle against various manifestations of dogmatism. You know that in our country there have been activities of sectarianists. They have been detached from life, treated the problems raised in life with a dogmatic attitude, and tried to tamper with our party's Leninist line and obstruct our progress. However, the Central Committee of our Party exposed and abandoned these sectarianists. We got rid of them, so the air there is purer, and our economy is booming as never before, despite the fact that these dogmatists have been shouting about the policies implemented by our party and our government.
	Everyone knows that in the Polish People's Republic, within the Polish United Workers' Party, there are also dogmatists. They do not accept the policies implemented by the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party headed by Comrade Gomulka, and they say that they are fighting for the implementation of the true Marxist-Leninist policies followed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, saying that they only want to correct the policies of your party so that this policy fully conforms to the policies implemented by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Parties of other socialist countries.
	These party members sometimes pretend to be the closest friends of the Soviet Union, asserting that they, and only they, are the true embodiment of Marxist-Leninist ideas in the Polish party, asserting that they are fighting to correct the political line of the Polish United Workers' Party in order to make it implement Marxist-Leninist policies to promote the unity of our two parties and the people of our two countries and unite our actions.
	At first glance, these people's actions are motivated by good intentions. However, if we observe things realistically, we will understand that this is a harmful and incorrect tendency.
	We believe that the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party cannot be required to fully comply with the policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union when implementing any policy to solve Poland's domestic life problems. The people of every country should build socialism and move towards communism in accordance with their own national, cultural and economic characteristics. The famous Leninist principle on this issue was embodied in the 1957 Moscow Declaration of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries. This principle is also included in the resolutions of the 20th National Congress of our party and was reaffirmed by the 21st Extraordinary National Congress. When explaining this Marxist-Leninist principle, the difference between us and the revisionists lies in the fact that the revisionists emphasize the differences in the specific conditions of the countries building socialism, and they completely ignore the common principles that are universally applicable to all socialist countries. We Marxist-Leninists want to emphasize the common, universally applicable principles of all our countries. For all those who truly hope to build socialism, instead of leading the cause into the quagmire of opportunism as the revisionists do, these principles are the foundation of the foundation. On this issue, there is no disagreement between us and the Polish United Workers' Party, and our views are consistent.
	Khrushchev said that the Polish United Workers' Party and its Central Committee creatively apply the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in light of the specific conditions of the country, and successfully implement the policy of building socialism in Poland. The activities of dogmatists within the Polish United Workers' Party have led to the weakening of the strength of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and objectively created an environment for the growth of revisionists and opportunists. The well-known events that occurred in Poland a few years ago once gave revisionists the opportunity to raise their heads and act rampantly, including activities against the Soviet Union. However, the vast majority of party members of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish people have been able to correctly understand the policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government in the past and present.
	Khrushchev went on to point out that the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, headed by Comrade Gomulka, has firmly implemented the correct policy of solving the task of building socialism in Poland and strengthening the relations between our two parties and the people of our two countries. Therefore, those who do not support the policy of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and do not support Comrade Gomulka are actually helping the revisionists, even though they are criticizing the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party from a far-left position, accusing it of "betraying" Marxism-Leninism. We believe that if the members of the Polish United Workers' Party who hold dogmatic views are indeed upright people, and if they hope for friendship between our two countries, then they should change their position and firmly support the policy implemented by the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party headed by our dear friend Comrade Gomulka.
	Khrushchev emphasized that the Polish United Workers' Party has the fine traditions of the Polish revolutionary workers' movement. It stubbornly defends the interests of the people, educates the masses to be infinitely loyal to the cause of socialism, and loyal to the great ideas of international proletarian unity.
	Khrushchev said that the Polish working people have made great achievements in rebuilding their homes, and are enthusiastically continuing to build a socialist society. They are making their own contribution to the common cause of strengthening the power of the socialist camp. We sincerely congratulate the Polish people on their continued greater achievements in the noble cause of socialist construction.
	Khrushchev went on to emphasize that the Soviet Union, Poland, and all countries in the socialist camp will always unremittingly defend the cause of universal peace, and will spare no effort to ease international tensions.
	Finally, Khrushchev read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Presidium of

    赫鲁晓夫在波兰国庆大会上讲话
    苏波两国友好关系永远牢不可破
    祝波兰社会主义建设事业取得更大成就
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社华沙讯：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫21日在华沙举行的波兰人民共和国十五周年庆祝大会上讲话时说，波兰人民共和国的成立不仅是波兰人民历史中的转折点，而且是对世界社会主义发展起重大作用的、具有国际意义的事件。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中详细谈到了苏联党政代表团访问波兰和同波兰领导人会谈的感想。他说，在同波兰领导人的坦率会谈中，我们没有感觉到，我们对在波兰建设社会主义和在苏联建设共产主义问题上，以及在国际问题上有什么不同的见解。我们再一次确信，我们和我们的波兰朋友，对下列极重要的任务有一致的见解：进一步加强我们两国的友好关系，加强我们伟大社会主义阵营国家的团结，在为争取和平、争取消除国际紧张局势和“冷战”以保证世界和平而进行斗争的问题上加强团结。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，社会主义的敌人企图离间波兰同苏联和其他社会主义国家的关系，然而这种企图是徒劳无益的。他说，但是，这并不意味着我们对和平和社会主义的敌人的阴谋可以高枕无忧。社会主义的敌人没有放下武器，他们仍然在竭尽全力，以便像他们过去说过，现在还在说的那样“击退”社会主义。这种政策的实质在于，企图从内部削弱社会主义国家，其办法是威胁利诱和在社会主义国家之间制造不和，从而破坏和瓦解团结一致的社会主义阵营。
    赫鲁晓夫说，不久以前，热衷于“击退”政策的人把赌注主要放在匈牙利和波兰上面，因为他们以为这两个国家是社会主义阵营中最薄弱的环节。后来，他们不得不放弃对匈牙利的念头。但是，看来迄今对波兰还没有死心。他们硬说什么波兰在社会主义国家中占着某种特殊地位，他们硬说什么同苏联和其他社会主义国家比较起来波兰不是贯彻社会主义原则的坚定榜样，因此，可以指望使波兰脱离社会主义阵营。但是，除非是对波兰和整个社会主义阵营的现状非常非常不了解，否则就不会去转什么能够使波兰同苏联和其他社会主义国家不和的念头。
    赫鲁晓夫说，当然，在不久以前，我们两国的关系中存在过一些使敌人得以指望我们两国之间会发生不和的因素。我们同你们把过去存在过的那些不顺利的事情看作是我们两党和两国之间极为纯洁的关系中的一段插曲，看作是薄薄的一层尘埃。但是，对我们的敌人来说，这点尘埃就足够使他们去想像他们所指望的苏波之间存在着某种矛盾的暗礁的了。他们现在应当明白，我们之间从来没有、也不会有矛盾，至于所说的薄薄的一层尘埃，那么，波兰人民和苏联人民只要吹一口气就可以把它完全吹掉。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们对现在我们同波兰人民共和国的关系，对在党的问题上和意识形态问题上观点的一致，对在我们两国关系问题上看法的一致，感到非常满意。我们两国政府之间没有任何分歧，或者对问题有不同的理解。
    不论在解决本国的国内生活问题、或者在解决外交政策方面的问题上，苏联共产党和波兰统一工人党都是从一致的利益、从马克思列宁主义的立场、从反对修正主义和机会主义的立场、从反对教条主义的立场出发的。把我们联在一起的还有一个伟大的崇高的目的——建设光辉的共产主义大厦，我们的友谊是永恒的，是永远牢不可破的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，全部历史经验都证明，我们两国的友好关系一向是有利于我们两国人民的，相反地，只有我们两国的敌人才喜欢我们关系中发生纠纷。凡是企图在我们之间散布不和和不信任的人，不管他们是有意或者无意，他们都是在反对波兰和苏联两国人民的根本切身利益，都是在帮助社会主义和和平事业的敌人。赫鲁晓夫说，毫无疑问，在波兰还有一些修正主义者和机会主义者。他们失去了支撑点，他们的活动受到了严格的限制，但是，他们当然还存在着。在我们国家里，现在也有着这类分子，不过他们现在已经汲取不到滋养的汁液，丧失了出头露面的可能。但是，这并不等于说，我们可以放松对以往现象可能重演的注意和斗争。我们应当时刻戒备，从思想上揭露并采取坚决措施来反对修正主义和机会主义的一切表现。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在国际工人运动中，我们过去和今后将一直同那些自称是共产主义者、而实际上却在执行破坏马克思列宁主义学说、破坏社会主义阵营的政策的奸细作斗争。我们的敌人对这些分裂分子有正确的了解，对他们的作用有正确的估价，所以在精神上、物质上经常鼓励他们进行破坏活动。我们过去和将来都要为我们的意识形态的纯洁、为马克思列宁主义学说的纯洁而进行不调和的斗争。他说，我们认为，目前在各国共产党和工人党的关系中存在着空前未有的那种意识形态上的一致。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们两个党现在和将来都要对形形色色的修正主义者、对修正主义进行不调和的斗争，因为修正主义是马克思列宁主义事业的主要危险，同时，我们也不要忘记必须对教条主义的各种表现进行坚决的斗争。你们知道，在我国曾有过宗派主义分子的活动，他们脱离生活，用教条主义态度对待生活中提出的问题，他们曾企图篡改我们党的列宁主义方针，阻挠我们的前进。但是，我们党的中央委员会揭露并抛弃了这些宗派主义分子。我们摆脱了他们，因而我们那里的空气更加纯洁了，我国的经济正在获得空前的蓬勃发展，尽管这些教条主义者对我们党和我国政府执行的政策曾叫喊不休。
    大家知道，在波兰人民共和国、在波兰统一工人党内，也有教条主义者。他们不接受以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党中央委员会所执行的政策，并且说他们是在为执行苏联共产党所遵循的真正的马克思列宁主义的政策而斗争，说什么他们只想纠正你们党的政策，以便使这个政策完全符合苏联共产党和其他社会主义国家共产党所执行的政策。
    这些党员有时把自己装扮成苏联最亲密的朋友，断言他们、而且只有他们才是波兰党中马克思列宁主义思想的真正体现者，断言他们在为纠正波兰统一工人党的政治路线而斗争，要使它执行马克思列宁主义的政策，以促进我们两党、两国人民的团结，联合我们的行动。
    乍一看来，这些人的行动是出于善良的动机。但是，如果现实地观察事物，就会明白，这是有害的、不正确的倾向。
    我们认为，不能要求波兰统一工人党中央委员会在解决波兰国内生活的任何问题时所执行的政策都要完全符合苏联共产党的政策。每一个国家的人民都应当根据本国的民族、文化和经济特点来建设社会主义和走向共产主义。关于这一问题的著名的列宁主义原理在1957年社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议莫斯科宣言中得到了体现，这个原理也载入了我们党的第二十次代表大会的决议中，并得到第二十一次非常代表大会的重申。在解释这个马克思列宁主义原理时，我们同修正主义者之间的区别在于，修正主义者强调建设社会主义的各个国家存在着具体条件的不同，他们完全忽视所有社会主义国家都具有的共同的放之四海而皆准的原理。我们马克思列宁主义者要突出地强调的，正是我们所有国家共同的放之四海而皆准的原则，对一切真正希望建设社会主义、而不是像修正主义者所做的那样把事业引向机会主义泥坑的人来说，这些原则是基础的基础。在这个问题上，我们同波兰统一工人党之间没有任何分歧，我们的观点是一致的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，波兰统一工人党及其中央委员会结合本国具体条件创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的基本原则，并且成功地执行着在波兰建设社会主义的方针。波兰统一工人党党内的教条主义者的活动导致波兰统一工人党中央委员会力量的削弱，并且在客观上给修正主义者和机会主义者创造了滋长的环境。几年前在波兰所发生的众所周知的事件，曾经使修正主义者有机会抬头和猖獗活动，其中包括在反对苏联方面进行的活动。但是，波兰统一工人党绝大多数党员和波兰人民过去和现在都能正确地理解苏联共产党和苏联政府的政策。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党中央委员会所坚决执行着解决在波兰建设社会主义的任务、加强我们两党和我们两国人民的关系的正确方针。因此，不支持波兰统一工人党中央的政策、不支持哥穆尔卡同志的人，实际上就是助长修正主义者的声势，尽管他们是从极左的立场来批评波兰统一工人党的领导，责备它“叛变”马克思列宁主义。我们认为，如果抱着教条主义观点的波兰统一工人党的党员，的确是正直的人，如果他们希望我们两国友好，那么，就应当改变自己的立场，坚决支持以我们亲爱的朋友哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党中央委员会所执行的政策。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，波兰统一工人党具有波兰革命的工人运动的优良传统。它顽强地捍卫人民的利益，教育群众无限忠实于社会主义事业，忠实于国际无产阶级团结的伟大思想。
    赫鲁晓夫说，波兰劳动人民在重建家园方面取得了巨大的成就，并且热情高涨地继续建设社会主义社会。他们正在为加强社会主义阵营威力的共同事业作出自己的贡献。我们衷心祝贺波兰人民在社会主义建设的崇高事业方面继续取得更大的成就。
    赫鲁晓夫接着强调指出，苏联、波兰以及社会主义阵营的一切国家都将始终不懈地保卫普遍和平的事业，将不遗余力来缓和国际紧张局势。
    赫鲁晓夫最后宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联最高苏维埃主席团和苏联部长会议给波兰统一工人党中央委员会、波兰人民共和国国务委员会和波兰部长会议的贺电，贺电祝贺波兰人民共和国国庆十五周年。
