Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 4th. The Ministry of Health recently held a symposium in Nanjing on the compilation of traditional Chinese medicine textbooks. More than 40 people attended the symposium, including heads and teachers from five Colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Nanjing. Teachers from ten traditional Chinese medicine specialized schools in Jiangsu Province also attended the meeting.

Traditional Chinese medicine schools have been widely established in various provinces and cities throughout our country, and the cause of traditional Chinese medicine education has greatly developed. In order to meet the needs of teaching, schools in various regions have compiled many teaching materials themselves. However, the content, names, and compilation styles of the textbooks for each subject are not uniform enough, and the content is not very systematic or complete. In order to further standardize the Colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine and cultivate a group of senior traditional Chinese medicine practitioners who can systematically master the theory and medical technology of traditional Chinese medicine and have basic knowledge of modern medicine, it is extremely necessary to compile a set of systematic textbooks that meet the requirements of the training objectives for unified use by Colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine throughout the country. In April of this year, the Ministry of Health held a symposium on traditional Chinese medicine teaching in Chengdu, and decided that the five Colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Nanjing should divide the work of compiling textbooks for the fifteen traditional Chinese medicine courses required by Colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The completion of this batch of teaching materials will not only play a significant role in the development of traditional Chinese medicine education, but also contribute to the promotion and sorting out of the medical heritage of the motherland.

The symposium held in Nanjing discussed and revised the "Several Opinions of the Ministry of Health on Compiling Teaching Syllabuses and Unified Textbooks for Colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Draft)," as well as the draft teaching syllabuses and textbook compilation outlines for the fifteen courses of Chinese Medical History, Medical Classical Chinese, *Neijing* (Inner Canon), Chinese Materia Medica, Formulas, Diagnostics, *Shanghan Lun* (Treatise on Cold Damage), *Wenbing* (Warm Disease) studies, Internal Medicine, Surgery and Traumatology, Gynecology, Pediatrics, Throat and Ophthalmology, Acupuncture and Moxibustion, and Selected Medical Case Studies of Various Schools, drafted by the five Colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine. At the same time, the numbering principles for traditional Chinese medicine textbooks were determined. Through extensive exchange of views, the symposium basically reached a consensus on some controversial issues in the past compilation of teaching materials, unified the names of the textbooks for each subject, and determined the compilation style and specific content.

    卫生部在南京召开座谈会
    讨论中医教材编写提纲
    新华社南京4日电　卫生部最近在南京召开中医教材编写座谈会。出席座谈会的有北京、上海、广州、成都、南京等五个中医学院的负责人和教师四十多人。江苏省十个中医专科学校也派教师列席。
    我国各省市已普遍办起中医学校，中医教育事业有了很大发展。各地学校为适应教学需要，自编了许多教材。但是各科教材之间在内容、名称编写体例上不够统一，内容也不十分系统和完整。为了使中医学院进一步正规化，以培养一批能系统掌握中医学理论和医疗技术，并具有现代医学基础知识的高级中医师，极需编写一套系统的、符合培养目标要求的教材，供全国各中医学院统一使用。卫生部今年4月份曾在成都召开中医教学座谈会，确定由北京、上海、广州、成都、南京等五个中医学院分工编写中医学院所需要的十五门中医课程的教材。这批教材编写完成后，不仅对发展中医教育事业将起重大作用，而且也将对发扬、整理祖国医学遗产作出贡献。
    这次在南京召开的座谈会，讨论和修改了“卫生部对编写中医学院教学大纲及统一教材的几点意见（初稿）”，以及五个中医学院分工起草的中国医学史、医古文、内经、中药学、方剂学、诊断学、伤寒论、温病学、内科学、外科学与伤科学、妇科学、儿科学、喉科与眼科学、针灸学、各家学说医案选等十五门课程的教学大纲和教材编写提纲草案。同时，确定了中医教材的编号原则。通过广泛的交换意见，座谈会对过去编写教材上一些争论未决的问题，基本上取得一致的意见，统一了各科教材的名称，确定了编写体例和具体内容。
