Both Centralized Leadership and Efforts from All Sides: Xuanzhuang Commune Party Committee Improves Leadership Methods, Work Becomes More Detailed

    (Our Report) The Xuanzhuang People's Commune Party Committee in Fengrun District, Tangshan City, Hebei Province, pays attention to implementing the leadership method of "centralized leadership and efforts from all sides" in leading production, thus making leadership change from passive to active and work more in-depth and meticulous.

    In the past, the Xuanzhuang People's Commune Party Committee in Fengrun District, Tangshan City, had some problems in its leadership work: it took on too much work and managed it too rigidly. It grasped and managed all aspects of work, regardless of importance or timing, causing the Party Committee, a leadership organization, to be trapped in a circle of事務主义 [Shìwù zhǔyì - roughly "being bogged down in routine matters"], unable to concentrate on considering and studying major issues. Furthermore, for some major tasks, although the Party Committee took them on, decisions were often made by a few people, failing to give full play to the role of collective leadership and the spirit of independent responsibility of the Party Committee members. This made it impossible to effectively combine the leadership of the Party Committee with the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people.

    How can we earnestly implement the spirit of "centralized leadership, division of labor and responsibility, Party Committee decision, and efforts from all sides" by the Party Committee, based on the characteristics of the scope of operation and organizational scale of the People's Commune?

    Through practice, they believe that the things the Commune Party Committee should take on are: (1) deciding on key issues for achieving increased grain and cotton production, such as formulating production plans, labor plans, planting plans, major measures for increasing production, and financial plans; (2) the central tasks of each period; (3) construction undertakings of the entire commune, such as large-scale water conservancy projects and the investment and construction of commune-run factories; (4) political education work, regularly analyzing the ideological status of cadres and the masses, and proposing ideological education tasks.

    How to do a good job in centralized leadership? The main thing is to give full play to the collective leadership role of the Party Committee, hold regular Party Committee meetings, and discuss and decide on major issues. After a major issue is decided, the secretary and members are responsible for implementing it according to their respective divisions of labor. Under the premise of "centralized leadership," important tasks are divided into several fronts, with several secretaries taking charge of each front.

    In order to regularly grasp major issues and promote work, in addition to being responsible for a certain amount of work, the Commune Party Committee secretaries also study the current situation, study the instructions of the higher-level Party Committee, exchange work information, and plan key tasks during the "Secretary Office Day." Originally, the four secretaries met irregularly to study issues. Later, they felt that this was very necessary, so they decided to meet once every seven days to study work, establishing it as a system. According to their personal experience, adhering to the "Secretary Office Day" is very helpful for handling problems in practical work.

    Centralized leadership does not equal arbitrariness; it must be implemented on the basis of extensive democracy. All major issues under the jurisdiction of the Party Committee are decided collectively by the entire committee. Before deciding on major issues, they generally communicate with the Party Committee members, ask them to prepare opinions, and solicit the opinions of the masses. For example, when formulating the planting plan, the secretary communicated with the members in advance. Some members consulted with the production team leaders, some discussed with the masses, and some invited old farmers to a forum. The planting plan formulated by the Party Committee in this way not only meets the requirements of the state plan but also suits local conditions. The major issues decided by the Party Committee in this way not only concentrated the opinions of all Party Committee members but also extensively promoted democracy.

    Without "efforts from all sides," there can be no "centralized leadership." In order to free up more time to consider major issues, the Commune Party Committee delegated some powers to the production teams to give play to the initiative of the grassroots. For example, in the past, diversified economic production was completely controlled by the Party Committee. Now, the Party Committee only stipulates in principle that diversified economic production must be included in the state plan and carried out with about 9% of the auxiliary labor force, based on the principle of 副业支持农业 [Fùyè zhīchí nóngyè - roughly "sideline occupations supporting agriculture"]. The specific matters of operation and management, labor arrangements, etc., are handled by the brigade or production team.

    After the Party Committee collectively studies and makes decisions on the central tasks of a certain period, each department and each organization go their separate ways in combination with the work of each department, thus mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties, and the central tasks and departmental work can also be united into one force.

### 既要集中领导　又要各方去办  宣庄公社党委改进领导方法工作越做越细致

    既要集中领导　又要各方去办
    宣庄公社党委改进领导方法工作越做越细致
    本报讯　河北唐山市丰润区宣庄人民公社党委，在领导生产中注意贯彻“集中领导，各方去办”的领导方法，因此使领导由被动变主动，工作更深入细致了。
    唐山市丰润区宣庄人民公社党委，过去在领导工作上曾出现这样一些问题：工作揽得过多过死，各方面的工作，不论轻重，不分时机，什么都抓，什么都揽，使党委这样一个领导机构，陷在事务主义的圈子里，无法集中精力去考虑和研究重大问题。再就是有些重大工作，党委会虽然揽了，但是往往由少数人作决定，不能发挥集体领导的作用，也不能发挥党委委员独立负责的精神，这样就使得党委会的领导同广大干部和群众的积极性不能很好地结合起来。
    怎样根据人民公社经营范围、组织规模等特点，认真贯彻党委“集中领导，分工负责，党委决定，各方去办”的精神呢？
    他们经过实践，认为公社党委应该揽起来的事情是：（一）决定实现粮棉增产的关键问题，像制订生产规划、劳动规划、种植计划、主要增产措施、财务规划等。（二）各个时期的中心工作。（三）全社性的建设事业，如大型水利工程，社办工厂的投资和建设等。（四）政治教育工作，经常分析干部、群众的思想状况，提出思想教育任务。
    怎样作好集中领导？主要是充分发挥党委会的集体领导的作用，定期开好党委会，讨论决定重大问题。一个重大问题决定后，书记和委员就按照分工分头负责贯彻执行。在“集中领导”的前提下，把重要工作划分几条战线，由几个书记分线挂帅掌握。
    为了经常抓住重大问题，推动工作前进，公社党委书记们除了分工掌握一定的工作以外，还在“书记办公日”研究当前形势，研究上级党委的指示，交换工作情况，计划重点工作。原先是四个书记不定期的碰头研究问题，后来，认为这样做很必要，就确定每七天到一起研究一次工作，作为制度确定下来。根据他们的切身体会，坚持“书记办公日”，对处理实际工作中的问题帮助很大。
    集中领导不等于独断，必须在广泛的民主基础上来实行。凡是党委会所主管的重大问题，都是由全体委员会集体决定。在决定重大问题以前，一般都先和党委委员们通气，要求委员们准备意见，同时还要征求群众的意见。如制订种植计划时，书记事先和委员们通了气，有的委员找生产队长合计，有的找群众商量，有的请老农座谈。党委会这样制订的种植计划，既符合国家计划的要求，又适合当地情况。党委会这样决定的重大问题，不仅集中了所有党委委员的意见，同时广泛地发扬了民主。
    没有“各方去办”，也不可能有“集中领导”。公社党委为了腾出较多的时间考虑重大问题，就把一些权力下放到生产队，以发挥基层的积极作用。比如多种经济生产，过去完全由党委掌握，现在，党委会只原则地规定：多种经济生产必须纳入国家计划，本着副业支持农业的原则，用9％左右的辅助劳力去搞。至于经营管理、劳力安排等具体事情，则由大队或生产队去办。
    对于一定时期的中心工作，党委集体研究作出决定后，由各个部门，各个组织结合各部门的工作分头去办，这样就把各方面的积极性都调动起来了，中心工作、部门工作也能拧成一股劲。
