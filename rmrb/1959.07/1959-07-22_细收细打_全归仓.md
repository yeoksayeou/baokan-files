    Careful Harvesting and Threshing, Everything into the Granary
    July is unbearably hot, the production team is busy harvesting, reaping golden rice in the morning, and transplanting tender green seedlings in the evening. The rooster crows before dawn, the work whistle blows loudly, men and women, young and old, all go to the fields, singing all the way out of the village. Everyone smiles at the harvest, the wind blows the rice ears, flashing golden light, every grain of rice is a drop of sweat, careful harvesting and threshing, everything into the granary. (Wu Youde)

    细收细打  全归仓
    七月里来热难当，生产队里收割忙，早上割罢金黄稻，晚上又栽嫩绿秧。公鸡开口天未亮，催工哨子一片响，男女老少齐下地，一路歌声出了庄。丰收人人笑开颜，风吹稻穗闪金光，一粒稻子一滴汗，细收细打全归仓。    （吴有德）
