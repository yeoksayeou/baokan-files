Longdong Daoqing Opera

"Let's go see Daoqing Opera!" People in Lanzhou have recently been spreading this happy news to each other. Daoqing Opera originally circulated in the old revolutionary base areas of Longdong in eastern Gansu, such as Huanxian, Huachi, Qingyang, and Ningxian. It is also known as Longdong Daoqing. Legend has it that it has a history of more than two thousand years. The tunes are high-pitched and passionate, yet melodious and beautiful, reflecting the bold and brave character of the people of Longdong. Unfortunately, for many years there has been no recorded script, and therefore it has not been possible to improve and promote it.

In order to explore folk art and enrich the cultural life of the people, the cultural leadership departments of Gansu Province have invited folk artists to orally transmit the tunes and performance techniques of Daoqing Opera to young actors, sentence by sentence, and further organize and enrich it. Based on the performance characteristics of shadow puppetry, it absorbs the performance techniques of Qin Opera, Beijing Opera, etc., creating a unique performance art. In terms of musical instruments, in addition to preserving the original four-stringed instrument, suona horn, yu gu clapper, and water clapper, more than a dozen instruments such as guzheng, pipa, sheng, and large, medium, and small violins have been added to accompany the performance, so the music is more rich and pleasant to listen to. The troupe also used this tune to perform the large-scale classical drama "Fengluo Pond." Because the story is tortuous, the tune is beautiful, and the performance is realistic, it has been performed more than 30 times in Lanzhou, with every performance fully booked, and has been highly praised.

    陇东道情戏
    “看道情戏去！”兰州的人民最近在互相传告着这个喜讯。道情戏原来流传在甘肃东部的环县、华池、庆阳、宁县等陇东老革命根据地。又名陇东道情。相传已有两千多年的历史。腔调高亢激昂，委婉优美，反映了陇东人民豪爽勇敢的性格。可惜多年来一直没有纪录脚本，因而没能提高推广。
    甘肃省文化领导部门为了发掘民间艺术，丰富人民的文化生活，请来了民间艺人，给青年演员一句一句地口传手授道情戏的曲调和表演手法，并进一步进行整理、丰富。根据皮影的表演特点，吸收秦腔、京戏等表演手法，创造了一套独特的表演艺术。在乐器方面，除保存了原有的四弦、唢呐、渔鼓夹板、水梆子外，又增加了古筝、琵琶、笙、大、中、小提琴等十几种乐器陪奏，因此音乐更为浑厚动听。该团又用这种曲调，排演的大型古典剧“枫洛池”，由于故事曲折，曲调优美，表演真实，在兰州演出三十余场，场场满座，倍受称赞。（附图片）
