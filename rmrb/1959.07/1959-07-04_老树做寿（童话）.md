The Old Tree Celebrates its Birthday (Fairy Tale)
    Dawoer Nationality Batu Baoyin

    One sunny summer morning, the sunlight was so bright. The green leaves shone brilliantly, birds sang towards the sun, and everything was bathed in comfort.

    An old hunter, at home, put on his hunting clothes, ate his fill of the fragrant venison and wild boar meat cooked by his daughter-in-law, took his hunting rifle, mounted his jujube-red horse, and set off with his beloved hunting dog.

    The forest was quite cool, with pine trees standing one after another, so dense that one could hardly see anything a few steps away. The old hunter strolled through the woods, and various birds sang to him. The leaves of the birch trees rustled "whoosh, whoosh," as if applauding the old hunter's arrival.

    The old hunter walked straight ahead, passing through green moss and gray rocks in the dense forest. As he walked, suddenly, a burst of "哗哗哗" laughter came from not too far away. "Where is that coming from?" Curious, the old hunter walked towards the sound. Ah, a dark mass, it turned out that many young trees were surrounding an old tree, celebrating its birthday! How lively: a small yellow bird was playing the trumpet, magpies were drumming, larks were singing, and geese were performing dances.

    The old tree saw the old hunter strolling from afar, and raised its voice to shout, "Children, quickly welcome our old master!" Everyone jumped and sang to welcome the old hunter, who happily sat in the middle.

    The celebration began. The old tree first cleared its throat and said, "Children! First, congratulations to our growing motherland. I am fifty years old this year and have experienced several eras. During the puppet Manchurian regime, the Japanese devils often came to cut down and steal trees, and terrible mountain fires burned us year after year. Our bodies were burned bare, and our beloved friends - orioles and rabbits - all ran away, taking refuge. Our lives were truly bitter and miserable..."

    The little yellow bird "chirped, chirped" as if saying, "Now we are back."

    The old tree continued, and when it spoke of the current life, it smiled: "I have finally lived to this day. Today is so different, completely different from the past! We live a peaceful and good life, and no one comes to cut us down anymore. The children can all live happily through their childhoods and grow into useful people. We old mother trees are also protected. Our life is extremely happy, because we have masters who protect our new life - the hunter forest rangers and foresters. The old hunter sitting here is one of them. They protect us as if protecting their own lives and have finally eliminated our enemy - mountain fires. Now we are constantly wearing colorful clothes, unafraid of wind and sun; our friends - little larks and rabbits - are often with us, jumping and dancing. Our life is extremely happy."

    As the old tree spoke, it said to the nearby apple trees, "Children, our old master has been sitting here for half a day and hasn't had a drink of water. Quickly grow some apples!" Those apple trees were truly obedient. With a few "squeak, squeak" sounds, they grew many apples. The old hunter ate and laughed, and the surrounding trees also laughed. Larks, little yellow birds, magpies... jumped and sang, making a racket again. Various birds, animals, and trees enthusiastically requested the old hunter to sing them a song. The old hunter thought: I shouldn't refuse, so he let loose his voice and sang an Oroqen folk song:
        "The red sun rises on the eastern hills,
    The Oroqen people have hope.
    Chairman Mao is like the red sun,
    The Oroqen people have gained light.
    How should we repay Chairman Mao?
    We must protect the beautiful forest well!..." (Attached image)

    老树做寿（童话）
    达斡尔族　巴图宝音
    夏天的一个晴朗的早晨，阳光是那样的明媚。绿油油的树叶被照得闪着亮光，鸟儿向着阳光歌唱，万物都被照得挺舒坦。
    一个老猎人在家里穿好了猎衣，吃饱了儿媳给煮的香喷喷的狍子肉和野猪肉，拿上猎枪，跨上了枣红马，带着可爱的猎狗出发了。
    森林里挺阴凉，松树一棵挨着一棵，简直密得几步远什么也看不见。老猎人漫步在林间，各种各样的鸟都向着他歌唱，白桦树的叶子“呼哒、呼哒”直响，原来是鼓掌欢迎老猎人哩。
    老猎人朝直向前走，走过了密林中的绿苔藓和青岩石。走呀走呀，忽然，从不太远的地方传来一片“哗哗哗”的笑声。“从哪里传来的呢？”老猎人好奇地朝着声音那边走去。唔呵，黑压压的一大片，原来是很多年轻年幼的树围着一棵老树，替它做寿哩！好热闹啊：小黄雀吹喇叭，鹊雀给鼓锣，百灵鸟唱歌，大雁表演舞蹈。
    老树从老远看到老猎人漫步走来，便挑起嗓门喊：“孩子们，快欢迎我们的老主人吧！”大家都向老猎人跳啊唱啊的欢迎起来，老猎人就高高兴兴地坐在中间了。
    联欢会开始了。老树先清清嗓门讲道：“孩子们！首先祝贺我们生长的祖国。我今年五十岁啦，经历过好几个时代。在伪满时候，鬼子常来乱砍盗伐，可怕的山火终年累月的烧我们，我们身上烧秃了，我们可爱的朋友——黄莺儿、小兔儿都逃走啦，都避难去了，我们的生活真是又苦闷又凄惨……”
    小黄雀“叽叽喳喳，叽叽喳喳”好像说：“现在我们又回来了”。
    老树又接着说下去，说到现在的生活，它就笑了：“我总算活到了现在。现在的日子可不同啦，和过去完全不同啦！我们过着平平安安的好日子，再也没有人来砍伐我们，孩子们都能快活地活过少年时代长大成材，我们老母树也都得到了保护。我们的生活幸福极了，有了保护我们新生活的主人——猎民护林员和营林员。在这里坐着的这位老猎人，就是这样子的人。他们像保护自己生命一样的保护着我们，才终于消灭了我们的敌人——山火。现在我们常年穿着花花绿绿的衣裳，不怕风吹和日晒；我们的朋友——小百灵、小兔儿又经常同我们在一起跳呀舞呀的，我们的生活快乐极了。”
    老树说着说着，又对旁边的几棵苹果树说道：“孩子，咱们的老主人在这里坐半天了，也没有捞着水喝，你快长出些苹果来吧！”那几棵苹果树真听话，“吱吱吱”几声响，长出了好多苹果来。老猎人一边吃着一边笑着，周围的树也都笑着。百灵鸟、小黄雀、鹊雀……又都跳的跳、唱的唱，闹腾起来了。各种鸟兽和树都热烈地要求老猎人给他们唱一只歌子，老猎人心想：这不应该推辞，就放开了嗓子，唱出一只鄂伦春民歌来：
      “红红的太阳出在东山岗，
    鄂伦春民族有了希望。
    毛主席好比那红太阳，
    鄂伦春民族得到了光明。
    我们怎样报答毛主席？
    要好好保护美丽的森林！……”（附图片）
