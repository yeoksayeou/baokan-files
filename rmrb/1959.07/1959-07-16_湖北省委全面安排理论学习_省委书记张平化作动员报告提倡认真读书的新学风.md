The Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has made a decision on the political theory study of cadres, making comprehensive arrangements for study. On the 8th, a telephone conference was held to make arrangements for the local Party committees, municipal Party committees, and county Party committees. In the cadre study, the provincial, prefectural (municipal), and county Party schools are important bases. The Party committees at all levels are now making preparations before the start of school, and it is expected that cadres will be trained in rotation starting on September 1. The Provincial Party Committee decided that the Provincial Party School will mainly train intermediate-level cadres and, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, will hold reading groups for senior cadres. In addition to the participation of senior cadres from the Provincial and Prefectural (Municipal) Party Committees, some county Party committee first secretaries with high self-study abilities will also be absorbed. The reading group will focus on self-study. These two groups of cadres will mainly study Political Economy (Third Edition), Volume 2, and Selected Documents of the Party (including important decisions and instructions of the Party and important instructions of Chairman Mao). Prefectural (Municipal) Party schools will train leading cadres equivalent to those from communes and administrative districts, studying certain documents of the Party (including work methods) and basic knowledge of the Party. Their task is to further understand and master the Party's line, principles, and policies, and certain relevant basic theoretical knowledge, summarize experience, improve political and ideological levels, and improve their work style. County Party schools will train branch cadres and general cadres of county-level directly affiliated agencies, combining the current central tasks, and through the study of Party documents and basic knowledge of the Party (including branch work), rectify their work style, enhance Party spirit, improve work ability, and understand and master the Party's line, principles, and policies. Party branches in factories, rural areas, and schools will also hold night Party schools, either independently or jointly, to conduct more systematic education on basic Party knowledge and relevant central tasks for Party members and the masses.

In the teaching content of the above-mentioned Party schools and night Party schools at all levels, some practical work issues and typical examples should be discussed, and the two books "Good People and Good Deeds" and "Bad People and Bad Deeds" compiled by the Provincial Party Committee should be carefully studied in order to better implement the principle of linking theory with practice.

Since the study of working cadres is a large undertaking, Party committees at all levels are grasping the study of this group of cadres. Working cadres are all incorporated into study groups. The study of working cadres equivalent to the county level focuses on self-study, and cadres below the county level adopt a combination of self-study, explanation, tutoring, and discussion. The Provincial Party Committee requires all working cadres to formulate simple and feasible reading plans and democratically formulate study systems. The study groups of Party committees and Party groups at all levels play a core role in their respective units and systems, undertaking the leadership and guidance of study.

The Hubei Provincial Party Committee's decision particularly emphasized the issue of study quality, advocating diligent and systematic reading, and establishing a style of studying diligently, linking theory with practice, thinking independently, and freely debating. All cadres participating in political theory study will be examined in various forms, such as writing papers, writing心得 (personal insights), writing summaries, answering test papers, or during various meetings, depending on each individual's situation. When evaluating cadres, study is listed as one of the contents of cadre assessment.

In order to enable cadres to study political theory well, the Provincial Party Committee decided to establish a Marxist-Leninist theoretical team. The original theoretical instructors in various places who have participated in practical work training will quickly return to their posts and try to equip the required number of theoretical instructors. The improvement of theoretical instructors will be carried out in the form of reading groups or in batches to the Provincial Party School for rotation training. Party organizations at all levels are required to strengthen the leadership of this work, and leading cadres should take the lead in participating in study, leading study, abiding by the study system, and participating in study exams to achieve good results, so as to promote overall study.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 15th - Comrade Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a mobilization report on the political theory study of cadres on the 11th to more than 1,100 people, including Party leaders of various departments and commissions of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, various units of the Hubei Provincial People's Committee, Party secretaries and propaganda ministers of various institutions of higher learning, and some leading cadres in Wuhan. After explaining the important significance of cadres mastering Marxist-Leninist social science in the new situation of the current socialist construction, he analyzed the purpose of cadre learning theory, the content of learning, the methods and systems of learning. He said: Marxist-Leninist theory, the experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are our "guides" and must be studied and applied, but we also need to summarize our own practical experience well to supplement and develop them. The people's democratic revolution went through a long process of exploration and paid a considerable price. Finally, the guiding ideology, political line, and organizational line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong were summarized, and the objective inevitability of the democratic revolution was basically recognized. Today, we are carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, and want to shorten this exploration process as much as possible and pay less of a price. The key lies in learning.

What to learn? He said: There are three parts to the learning materials. First, the important documents of the Party Central Committee and the works of Chairman Mao; this is the Sinicization of Marxism-Leninism, a model of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the actual situation in China. In the past, it was used to win the victory of the democratic revolution; now, it is used to solve the problems of socialist construction in China. Chairman Mao's works during the socialist construction period are still relatively unfamiliar to everyone and have not yet been fully mastered by the Party, so we need to study and understand them hard.

The second part of the teaching material is the third edition of the "Soviet Textbook of Political Economy," Volume 2. This book summarizes the experience of the Soviet Union more systematically and completely, and also absorbs some of the experience of China and other socialist countries. It gives a more detailed demonstration of the basic laws of the socialist economy. Its international significance also lies in pointing out the commonality of basic socialist principles; at the same time, it recognizes the national characteristics and different conditions of various countries, so the speed and form of achieving socialism are different. We must study hard, which will be of great benefit to us.

The third part of the teaching material is: studying "Good People and Good Deeds" and "Bad People and Bad Deeds" (note: these are two books that the Hunan Provincial Party Committee is compiling and printing), which are vivid and lively materials from the masses, with both positive and negative examples.

Comrade Zhang Pinghua said that learning the above-mentioned teaching materials will have a positive effect on theoretical work and social science research, because both aspects must follow the principle of "combining theory with practice."

When talking about learning methods and systems, he said: In terms of learning methods, we should advocate diligent reading and deep thinking, first reading roughly, then reading carefully; reading and thinking, reading and thinking again, and thinking and reading again. On the basis of diligent reading and deep thinking, we should carry out informal talks and discussions. In terms of methods, we should adopt self-study as the main method and tutoring as the auxiliary method. In particular, leading cadres should have the courage and habit of self-study, and tutors only play the role of "cooks" and "waiters." Establish necessary study and examination systems and promote study achievement manuals. The relevant leaders should make specific provisions on the arrangement of study time, the establishment of collective reading systems and discipline.

    湖北省委全面安排理论学习
    省委书记张平化作动员报告提倡认真读书的新学风
    本报讯　中共湖北省委对干部政治理论学习作出决定，全面安排学习。在8日召开了电话会议，向各地委、市委、县委作了布置。在干部学习中，省、地（市）、县委三级党校是重要基地之一。各级党委现正在作开学前的准备工作，预计在9月1日开始轮训干部。省委决定规定，省委党校主要是轮训中级干部，并在省委领导下举办高级干部读书会，除省、地（市）委高级干部参加外，还吸收部分自学能力较高的县委第一书记参加。读书会以自学为主。这两部分干部主要学习政治经济学（第三版）下册和党的文件选集（包括党的重要决议、指示和毛主席的重要指示）。地（市）委党校轮训相当于公社和管理区的负责干部，学习党的某些文件（包括工作方法）和党的基本知识，其任务是进一步领会和掌握党的路线、方针、政策，某些有关的基本理论知识，总结经验，提高政治思想水平，改进作风。县委党校轮训支部干部和县直属机关的一般干部，结合当前中心任务，通过学习党的文件和党的基本知识（包括支部工作），整顿作风，增强党性，提高工作能力，领会和掌握党的路线、方针、政策。工厂、农村、学校的党支部也将单独或联合举办夜党校，对党员群众进行较系统的党的基础知识和有关中心任务的教育。
    以上各级党校和夜党校的教学内容中，要讲些实际工作问题和典型事例，认真学习省委编写的“好人好事”和“坏人坏事”这两本书。以便更好地贯彻执行理论联系实际的原则。
    由于在职干部的学习是大量的，因此各级党委都在抓紧这部分干部的学习。在职干部一律编入学习小组。相当于县级的在职干部学习以自学为主，县级以下干部采取自学、讲解、辅导、讨论相结合的办法。省委要求所有的在职干部都订出简易可行的读书计划，民主制订学习制度。各级党委、党组的学习小组在本单位、本系统起核心作用，担负学习的领导和辅导工作。
    湖北省委决定特别强调了学习质量问题。提倡认真地系统的读书，树立刻苦钻研、联系实际、独立思考、自由争论的学风。对所有参加政治理论学习的干部，都将根据各人不同情况采取写论文、写心得、写总结、答试卷等形式或在召开各种会议中来进行考试。干部作鉴定时，学习列为考核干部的内容之一。
    为了使干部学好政治理论，省委决定建立马列主义的理论队伍。各地原有的理论教员已经参加实际工作锻炼的将迅速归队，尽量配齐规定的理论教员名额。理论教员的提高以读书会的组织形式进行，或分批到省委党校轮训。要求各级党组织，加强对这一工作的领导，领导干部要以身作则参加学习、领导学习、遵守学习制度、参加学习考试，获取较好成绩，以此来推动全盘学习。
    本报讯　中共湖北省委书记处书记张平化同志于11日向湖北省委各部委、省人委各单位的党内领导干部、各高等院校的党委书记、宣传部长及武汉市部分领导干部一千一百余人作了干部政治理论学习的动员报告。他在阐明在当前社会主义建设的新形势下，干部掌握马克思、列宁主义的社会科学的重要意义后，分别就干部学习理论的目的、学习的内容、学习的方法和制度作了分析。他说：马列主义的理论、苏联和其它社会主义国家的经验，是我们的“响导”，必须学习、运用它们，但还需很好地总结自己的实践经验，来补充和发展它们。人民民主革命经过了长期的摸索过程，付出了相当大的代价，最后总结出了以毛泽东同志为代表的指导思想、政治路线、组织路线，基本上认识了民主革命的客观必然性。今天我们进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，想尽量缩短这摸索过程，少付出些代价，关键在于学习。
    学习些什么？他说：学习的教材有三部分。第一、是党中央的重要文件，和毛主席的著作；这是马列主义的中国化，是马列主义普遍真理和中国实际相结合的典范。过去，运用它取得了民主革命的胜利；现在，运用它，解决着中国的社会主义建设问题。毛主席在社会主义建设时期的著作，大家还比较生疏，还未被全党所掌握，所以需要努力学习、领会它。
    第二部分教材是“苏联政治经济学教科书”三版下册。这书比较系统、完整地总结了苏联的经验，同时也吸收了中国和其它社会主义国家的部分经验。它对社会主义经济的基本规律，作了比较详尽的论证。它的国际意义还在于指出了社会主义基本原则的共同性；同时也承认各个国家的民族特点及不同条件，因而实现社会主义速度和形式各不相同。我们必须认真学习，对我们有极大的益处。
    第三部分教材是：学习“好人好事”和“坏人坏事”（按：这是湖南省委正在编印的两本书），这是群众中来的生动、活泼，既有正面、又有反面的教材。
    张平化同志说学习上面这些教材对理论工作、社会科学的研究工作将有积极的推动作用，因为无论那一方面都必须遵循“理论与实际相结合”的准则。
    他在谈到学习的方法和制度时说：学习方法上要提倡苦读深思，先粗读，后精读；边读边想，读了又想，想了又读。又在苦读深思的基础上，进行漫谈、讨论。方式上采取自学为主，辅导为副，特别是领导干部应有自学的勇气和习惯，辅导人员只起“炊事员”“服务员”的作用。建立必要的学习考试制度，推行学习成绩手册。学习时间的安排问题、集体读书的制度和纪律的建立，有关领导都应作出具体规定。
