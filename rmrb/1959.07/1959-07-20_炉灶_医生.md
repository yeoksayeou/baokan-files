The young employees of the Wuhan City Jianghan District Coal Building Wholesale Department, in the movement to conserve coal, have been devising ways to advise citizens and canteens of government organizations, acting as volunteer stove "doctors" to treat various stove "indigestion" ailments. The "Friendly Restaurant" in this district had a large furnace chamber, the fire was not concentrated, and the furnace chamber was deep, so it did not heat up well. The stove "doctors" helped them to reduce and shallow the furnace chamber, with immediate effect. In the past, they burned 18 tons of coal briquettes a month, but now 10 tons is enough. In the first half of this year, they used their spare time to modify more than 60 new-style coal-burning stoves for government canteens with more than 100 people in the whole district. According to statistics from sixteen units, more than 700 tons of bituminous coal and more than 500 tons of coal briquettes were saved in the first half of the year.

    炉灶“医生”
    武汉市江汉区煤建批发部的青年职工，在节约用煤运动中，想方设法给市民、机关团体食堂出谋献计，当义务的炉灶“医生”，治疗各种炉灶“消化不良”的病症。这个区“友好餐厅”炉膛大，火不集中，炉膛深，不上火。炉灶“医生”就帮助他们把炉膛改小、改浅，立见功效，过去一个月烧掉十八吨煤球，现在十吨就够了。今年上半年，他们利用业余时间，给全区一百人以上的机关食堂，修改了六十多个新式的烧煤炉灶。据十六个单位统计，上半年节约了烟煤七百多吨、煤球五百多吨。
