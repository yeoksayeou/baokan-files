Two or Three Things About Cooking Vegetables
　　Gao Shiqi

Vegetables come from the countryside. They have to travel a long distance, journeying through wind and dust, to be transported from the countryside to the city's small vegetable markets. They are subjected to attacks by countless flies and other insects, and the contamination of many people's hands and dirty water. Finally, when they reach our kitchens, they are already covered in dust and bacteria. According to bacteriologists, the total number of bacteria in each gram of vegetables reaches 250,000; each kernel of corn contains as many as 135,000 bacteria. In this situation, we must wash them clean, cook them thoroughly, and kill the bacteria. Some vegetables can be eaten raw or cooked; some vegetables must be cooked, as they are not easy to chew, swallow, and digest if not cooked, and the taste is not good. However, they should not be cooked for too long or until they are too mushy, as all the nutritional value will be lost.

What is the nutritional value of vegetables?

When vegetables come to our dining table, they bring many precious gifts to the human digestive tract. These gifts are carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and fiber.

Generally, vegetables contain starch and some glucose. After cooking, the starch granules are compressed by heat, expand and rupture, making them easier to digest. If they are cooked in boiling water, the starch will hydrolyze and turn into glucose in a short time. Therefore, there is a lot of starch and glucose in the vegetable juice.

Some bean vegetables contain rich protein. After cooking, some of these proteins dissolve in water, and some are solidified by heat. In this situation, they should not be cooked for too long, especially not in hard water, because water containing calcium and magnesium salts will harden the protein and make it difficult to digest.

Vegetables also contain various vitamins, minerals, and fiber. After cooking, vitamins are most affected. Vegetables are the main source of vitamins, and we must not let them be lost during cooking.

Some vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage, lettuce, corn, and radishes, as well as grains such as rice and flour, contain vitamin B. This vitamin is soluble in water. To avoid loss, it is advisable to add less water, and all the cooked water should be eaten.

Generally, vegetables contain vitamin C, with tomatoes and many fresh fruits being the richest. This vitamin is most easily destroyed by heat, so it should not be cooked for too long. If cooked in alkaline water or with baking soda, it will disappear completely. It is best to steam or cook at low temperatures, and the pot must be covered so that vitamin C can be preserved.

Vegetables are also the main source of our mineral nutrition. These precious minerals, such as potassium, phosphorus, iron, and iodine, appear in vegetables in the form of inorganic salts. They are easily soluble in water, so we must try our best to preserve them during cooking. Do not soak them in water for too long, and do not use too much water. It is best to steam them without adding water, and do not cut them too finely. Remember that to recover the loss of inorganic salts, all vegetable soups and juices are valuable.

Vegetables also have a lot of fiber on their leaves, stems, and outer skins, which will not be damaged by any cooking method. This fiber is useful for human excretion, so the outer skin of vegetables should not be peeled off completely.

    烹调蔬菜二三事
    高士其
    蔬菜来自农村，它们要经过长途的旅行，一路上风尘仆仆，才从农村运到城市的小菜场。不知受过多少苍蝇和其他昆虫的攻击，多少人的手和脏水的污杂，最后到达我们的厨房，已经满身都是灰尘和细菌了。据细菌学家估计，蔬菜每克含菌的总量达250，000；玉蜀黍每粟，含菌之数高至135，000。在这种情形之下，我们就不能不把它们洗干净，不能不把它们煮熟，不能不把细菌杀灭。有些蔬菜可以生吃，也可以熟吃；有些蔬菜必须煮熟，不煮熟就不容易咀嚼、下咽和消化，味道也不好，但不能煮得太久太烂，太久太烂了所有的营养价值都要失去了。
    蔬菜有什么营养价值呢？
    蔬菜来到我们的食桌上，带有许多珍贵的礼品献给人类的消化道，这些礼品就是碳水化合物，蛋白质、维生素、无机盐和纤维素等。
    一般蔬菜都含有淀粉和一些葡萄糖，经过烹煮以后，淀粉的颗粒受了热力的压迫，膨胀而破裂，这样就容易消化了，如果放在滚水里煮，不多一会，淀粉就会水解，变成了葡萄糖，所以菜汁里的淀粉和葡萄糖很多。
    有些豆类蔬菜，含有丰富的蛋白质，这些蛋白质，经过烹煮以后，有的溶解在水里；有的被热力所凝固。在这种情形之下，不能煮得太久，尤其不能放在硬性的水里煮，因为含有钙盐和镁盐的水，会使蛋白质硬化，而不易消化。
    蔬菜还含有各种维生素、无机盐和纤维素。经过烹煮以后，维生素所受的影响最大。蔬菜是维生素的主要来源，我们无论如何不能让它们在烹煮中丧失。
    有些蔬菜如白菜、莴苣、玉蜀黍和萝卜以及谷物之类如大米和面粉等，含有维生素乙，这种维生素能溶解在水里，为了避免丧失，以少加水为宜，并且应当把所煮过的水，统统设法吃掉。
    一般蔬菜，都含有维生素丙，番茄以及许多新鲜水果，含量最为丰富。这种维生素，最容易为热力所破坏，所以不能煮得太久，如果放在碱性水里煮或加上苏打煮，那它们就要全部消失，最好放在低温里蒸煮，锅上还得加盖，使维生素丙能保存下来。
    蔬菜又是我们矿物质营养的主要来源，这些宝贵的矿物质如钾、磷、铁、碘等，都是以无机盐的状态出现在蔬菜里，它们很容易溶解在水里，所以在烹煮的过程中，我们要尽量地设法保存它们。不要把它们泡在水里过久，也不要用太多的水来泡，最好用不加水的方法来蒸；不要切得太细碎。要知道，为了挽回无机盐的损失，一切菜汤和菜汁都是宝贵的。
    蔬菜在它们的叶子，茎和外壳上，还有不少的纤维素，不论用什么方法烹煮，都不致于损坏。这些纤维素，在人体排泄上是有用的，所以不应该把蔬菜的外皮剥得精光。
