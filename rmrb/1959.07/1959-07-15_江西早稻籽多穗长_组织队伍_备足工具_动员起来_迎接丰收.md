Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 15th: Thousands of miles of rice paddies roll in waves, and the joy of harvest is exciting. Millions of farmers in Jiangxi are actively preparing to harvest early rice and rush to plant late rice.

More than 22 million mu of early rice in Jiangxi Province is about to fully mature. The heavy, golden rice ears demonstrate the scene of the first great early rice harvest after collectivization. On the plains along the Gan River, Fu River, and Poyang Lake, the ears with many kernels and long grains bend the sturdy rice stalks like drawn bows. People have never seen such good rice. Jiangxi's people's communes are stepping up efforts to organize teams and prepare tools so that they can harvest and manage the early rice well and plant all late rice and other autumn crops well. Communes throughout the province have repaired 5 million pieces of equipment such as grain baskets, rice buckets, and rapid harvesters, and newly manufactured 3 million pieces of tools such as sickles, harvesters, threshers, and rice mills, basically preparing all kinds of tools for the summer harvest and planting. To ensure high yield and bumper harvest, many communes have also formulated many methods for "every grain returning to the granary" and a strict system for harvesting, managing, and using grain.

"Total mobilization of the whole people, resolutely fight the battle of summer harvest and summer planting!" is the action slogan of Jiangxi's summer harvest and summer planting. Commerce, industry, health, banking, grain departments, urban agencies, and residents have all been mobilized to fully support the communes in rushing to harvest and plant. (Attached picture)

    江西早稻籽多穗长
    组织队伍　备足工具　动员起来　迎接丰收
    本报南昌15日电　千里稻浪滚滚，丰收的喜悦激动人心。江西千百万农民积极准备收割早稻，抢种晚稻。
    江西省二千二百多万亩早稻即将完全成熟。沉甸甸、金黄黄的稻穗，显示了公社化后第一次早稻大丰收的景象。在赣江、抚河两岸和鄱阳湖滨平原上，籽多又长的稻穗压得粗壮的禾秆好似弯弓。人们从未见过这样好的稻子。江西各人民公社正在加紧组织队伍，准备工具，以便把早稻收好、管好，把晚稻等秋季作物全部种好。全省各公社已修理好谷箩、禾桶、快速收割器等五百万件，新制镰刀、收割机、脱粒器、打谷机等工具三百万件，基本上为夏收夏种备足了各种工具。为确保丰产丰收，许多公社还制定了许多“颗粒归仓”的办法和一套严密的收、管、用粮制度。
    “全民总动员，坚决打好夏收夏种仗！”是江西夏收夏种的行动口号。商业、工业、卫生、银行、粮食部门和城市机关、居民都已动员起来，全力支援公社抢收抢种。（附图片）
