Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 16th. The office of the Imam of Oman in Damascus announced on the 15th that Omani nationalist fighters recently attacked a British military center newly established between Izki and Falaj, killing five British soldiers, wounding some British troops, and setting fire to the British armory.

According to the announcement, four Omani fighters were sacrificed in this attack, one of whom was a woman. The office said that the woman was still holding a weapon when she was sacrificed.

Another message received by the office today stated that despite the curfew imposed on the roads to Nizwa and Green Mountain, which are frequently used by British escort convoys, and despite patrols by British troops on these roads, the number of landmine explosions on the aforementioned roads has increased in the past week.

The message also said that due to landmine explosions on the roads, the British army lost some trucks heading to Nizwa in the past week, some of which were carrying British soldiers. In addition, a medium-sized truck belonging to the British Petroleum Company was recently destroyed by a landmine near the Furud area.

    阿曼民族主义者袭击英军
    新华社大马士革16日电　阿曼教长驻大马士革办事处在15日宣布，阿曼民族主义战士最近进攻了英国军队新近在伊兹基和法拉克之间建立的军事中心，打死了五名英国士兵，打伤了一些英国兵，并且放火焚烧了英国人的军火库。
    据宣布，在这次进攻中，阿曼方面牺牲了四名战士，其中一名是妇女。办事处说，这位妇女在牺牲的时候手中还握着武器。
    办事处今天收到的另一个消息说，尽管在英国的护送队经常经过的通向尼兹瓦和绿山的公路上实行了宵禁，尽管英国军队在这些公路上巡逻，过去一星期在上述公路上发生的地雷爆炸事件仍然增加了。
    消息还说，由于公路上发生地雷爆炸，英国军队在过去一个星期中损失了一些开往尼兹瓦的卡车，其中有一些是载着英国兵的。此外，英国石油公司的一辆中型卡车最近在福鲁德地区附近被一枚地雷炸毁。
