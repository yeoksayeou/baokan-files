    Grasping Political and Ideological Work in Production
    The No. 3 Copy Party Branch of the No. 2 Workshop of Shandong Paper Mill has actively carried out ideological work and conscientiously implemented the Party's mass line. It has changed the passive situation of its past work and played the role of a fighting bastion in production.
    The main product of No. 3 machine is capacitor paper. Previously, the cadres of the machine unit and the Party branch were not clear enough on how to give play to the role of the Party organization. The branch committee was afraid that grasping production would replace administrative work. At the end of February this year, with the help of the factory Party committee, the branch made a summary and inspection of the previous period of work from top to bottom, and clearly understood the leading role of the Party, which should first be reflected in production. The central task of the Party is to first grasp the political and ideological work in production.
    In early March, the factory called for the completion of the first quarter production plan twelve days ahead of schedule. However, the finished product section couldn’t count the wet paper well, resulting in a large number of paper sheets that could not be put into storage in time. In the past, the solution to such problems was mostly for the workshop to issue orders to transfer people for support, which often caused dissatisfaction among the supporting units. This time, the branch decided to mobilize the masses to solve the problem. First, the branch explained the significance of completing the plan ahead of schedule to the Party members, and asked all Party members to come up with ideas. During the discussion, the Party members of the finished product section put forward several methods such as changing the three-shift system and carrying out a socialist labor competition. Comrades from other sections also proposed to guarantee that everyone would be actively mobilized to support. After considering everyone's opinions, the branch decided to launch a socialist labor competition in its own section to rely on its own efforts, and combine it with the support of other sections to overcome this difficulty. After the Party members returned to their sections, they mobilized the masses separately. Everyone said: The task of the finished product section is the same as our task, if the wire (used for bundling paper) cannot be supplied, we will take care of the packaging. The workers in the finished product section worked even harder, competing with each other, and their work efficiency continued to improve. In the past, each person could only pack forty to fifty pieces a day, but now it has increased to seventy to eighty pieces, or even more than one hundred pieces.
    In early June, the branch called on Party members to work together to overcome the quality barrier, and held a symposium inside and outside the Party to widely listen to the opinions of the workers. Finally, on the basis of solving the quality problem, specific measures for improving operation were put forward, so that the quality of capacitor paper reached the main standards stipulated by the state, and the output also increased significantly. The original daily output was 700 kilograms, but it has actually reached 800 to 900 kilograms.

    抓生产中的政治思想工作
    山东造纸总厂二号车间三抄党支部，积极作好思想工作，认真贯彻了党的群众路线，改变了过去工作上的被动局面，在生产中发挥了战斗堡垒作用。
    三号机的主要产品是电容器纸。以前机台和党支部的干部，对如何发挥党组织的作用不够明确，支委会怕抓了生产代替了行政工作。今年2月底，在厂党委帮助下，支部从上到下总结检查了前一段的工作，明确认识了党的领导作用，首先应该是体现在生产上。党的中心任务是首先要抓生产中的政治思想工作。
    3月初，厂里号召提前十二天完成首季生产计划。但成品工段因为纸湿不好数，造成了大批纸张不能及时入库。从前解决这样的问题，多半由车间下令调人支援，往往引起支援单位的不满。这次，支部决定发动群众来解决。首先，支部向党员说明了提前完成计划的意义，要求全党出主意。在讨论中，成品工段的党员提出了改三班制和开展社会主义劳动竞赛等几种办法。其他工段的同志也提出保证发动大家积极支援。支部考虑了大家的意见后，确定发动本工段开展社会主义劳动竞赛，自力更生，并结合其他工段支援来克服这一困难。党员回工段后，分头发动群众。大家都说：成品工段的任务和咱们的任务是一样的，铁丝（捆纸用的）供不上，咱们包砸。成品工段的工人干劲更大，他们互相竞赛，工作效率不断提高。过去每人每天只能打包四、五十件，现已提高到七、八十件，甚至百件以上了。
    6月初，支部号召党员齐心合力攻克质量关，并召开了党内外座谈会，广泛听取职工群众意见。终于在解决质量问题的基础上，提出了改进操作的具体措施，使电容器纸的质量达到了国家规定的几项主要标准，产量也有显著提高。原订日产量为七百公斤，实际已达到八百至九百公斤。
