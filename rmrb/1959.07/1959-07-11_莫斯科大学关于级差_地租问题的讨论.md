    Moscow University Discussion on the Issue of Differential Land Rent
    The Economics Department of Moscow University recently held a scientific discussion on the issue of differential land rent under the socialist system. Corresponding Academician Pashkov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences gave a report on "Differential Land Rent under the Socialist System," and Professor Sokolov gave a report on "Differential Land Rent and Net Income under the Socialist System." Pashkov said that the general preconditions for the existence of differential land rent under the socialist system are: limited land, and the social necessity to cultivate inferior land; differences in the fertility of different lands and the location of the land in relation to the market; the commodity nature of production under the socialist system, the law of value playing a role, and the direct reason for the existence of differential land rent is the existence of two forms of ownership. When discussing the issue of determining the value of agricultural products, he argued that the value of agricultural products cannot be determined by the production conditions of average land, because in this way it would be unknown where the surplus that constitutes land rent comes from. When discussing differential land rent I and differential land rent II, he believed that a portion of these two types of land rent should belong to the state, with a larger portion of the former belonging to the state. Sokolov believed that the direct reason for the existence of differential land rent is the existence of commodity production. The existence of two forms of ownership only has a certain relationship to the distribution of land rent. The social value of agricultural products is determined by the individual consumption on average land, and a portion of the differential land rent can be retained by the collective farms.
    More than thirty people spoke during the discussion. There was a consensus on the preconditions and causes for the existence of differential land rent, and there was also a basic consensus on the characteristics of the formation of the value of agricultural products, agreeing with Pashkov's views. However, there were different views on the distribution of differential land rent. Some argued that differential land rent I should belong entirely to the state because: 1. This part of the supplementary net income is created by more favorable natural conditions belonging to society; 2. This is a "false social value," which in capitalist society belongs to the landowners, and in the Soviet Union should belong to the state, which represents the interests of the whole society; 3. In order to give collective farms and state farms equal conditions, differential land rent I should also belong entirely to the state. Some argued that a portion of differential land rent I and differential land rent II should belong to the state, and the remainder should belong to the collective farms. They believed that if differential land rent I belongs entirely to the state, it would violate the principle of the material interests of collective farms with better operating conditions.

    莫斯科大学关于级差
    地租问题的讨论
    莫斯科大学经济系前一时期曾召开了一次关于社会主义制度下级差地租问题的科学讨论会，苏联科学院通讯院士帕什科夫作了“论社会主义制度下的级差地租”的报告，索科洛夫教授作了“论社会主义制度下的级差地租和纯收入”的报告。帕什科夫说，社会主义制度下级差地租存在的一般前提是：土地有限，社会必须耕种劣等土地；不同土地肥沃程度上差别以及土地对销售市场所处的位置；在社会主义制度下生产具有商品性，价值规律起作用，而级差地租存在的直接原因是两种所有制形式的存在。在谈到确定农产品价值的问题时，他认为农产品价值不能由中等土地的生产条件来决定，因为这样就不知道作为地租的那部分剩余从何而来。在谈到级差地租Ⅰ和级差地租Ⅱ时，他认为这两种地租中的一部分应归国家，前者归国家的部分要多一些。索科洛夫认为级差地租存在的直接原因是商品生产的存在。两种所有制的存在，只对地租的分配有一定的关系。农产品的社会价值是由中等土地上的个别消耗决定的，一部分级差地租可留给集体农庄。
    讨论时发言的有三十余人。关于级差地租存在的前提和原因问题，意见是一致的，关于农产品价值形成的特点问题，意见也基本上一致，都同意帕什科夫的看法。关于级差地租的分配问题，却有不同的看法，有的主张，级差地租Ⅰ完全归国家，因为，一、这部分补充纯收入，是由属于社会的更有利的自然条件创造的；二、这是“虚假的社会价值”，在资本主义社会它归土地所有者，在苏联就应归全社会利益的代表者——国家；三、为了使集体农庄和国营农场有同等条件，级差地租Ⅰ也应完全归国家。有的主张级差地租Ⅰ和级差地租Ⅱ的一部分归国家，其余部分归集体农庄，他们认为，如果级差地租Ⅰ完全归国家，就是违反经营条件较好的集体农庄的物质利益原则。
