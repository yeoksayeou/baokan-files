Breed Tens of Thousands of Fine-Wool Sheep

The National Symposium on Mutton Sheep Improvement discussed the task of continuing to expand the number of improved sheep breeding this year, requiring all regions to quickly determine improvement targets, raise rams well, and prepare technology and equipment to ensure timely breeding.

Xinhua News Agency reports: This year, various regions will continue to expand the number of improved sheep breeding on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward in mutton sheep improvement. The Ministry of Agriculture recently held a National Symposium on Mutton Sheep Improvement, which summarized the achievements and experiences of mutton sheep improvement work last year, and discussed this year's tasks and measures.

Gradually improving China's mutton sheep into fine-wool sheep or semi-fine-wool sheep to provide more raw materials for the wool textile industry. This work has been going on for several years, with the greatest achievement last year. Last year, about one-third of the country's ewes of breeding age were crossbred with fine-wool sheep, with a total of more than 9.28 million crossbreds, equivalent to one and a half times the total number of improved breeding from 1952 to 1957, and 2.7 times more than in 1957.

The meeting believes that the strengthening of leadership by Party committees and governments at all levels in mutton sheep improvement work is the basic reason for achieving last year's Great Leap Forward. Last year, most of the counties (banners) that carried out improved mutton sheep work established mutton sheep improvement committees or headquarters, led by leading comrades of the Party and government, and organized inspection teams to go deep into the grassroots to supervise and inspect. Artificial insemination technology networks were generally established in various regions, and a large number of artificial insemination personnel were trained; at the same time, the masses were mobilized, so the improved mutton sheep work was carried out both widely and rapidly.

The meeting believes that the conditions for mutton sheep improvement work this year are even better. Farmers and herdsmen in various regions see that the improved lambs produced by crossbreeding are large, have thick, white, fine and soft wool, and are very fond of them, which has increased their enthusiasm for improving mutton sheep. At the same time, with last year's experience and a set of material foundations and technical forces created last year, as long as we rely well on the people's communes, grasp it early, and grasp it well, we will definitely be able to achieve better results this year. At present, the important thing is to further implement the indicators to the communes and production teams, raise the rams well, and prepare the artificial insemination technology, equipment, etc., so as to breed in a timely manner.

    繁殖成千累万细毛羊
    全国绵羊改良工作座谈会讨论了今年继续扩大改良绵羊配种头数的任务，要求各地赶快确定改良指标，把种公羊养好，作好技术、器材准备，保证适时配种。
    据新华社讯　今年各地将在去年绵羊改良工作大跃进的基础上继续扩大改良绵羊的配种头数。最近农业部召开全国绵羊改良工作座谈会，总结了去年绵羊改良工作的成就和经验，讨论了今年的任务和措施。
    把我国绵羊逐步改良为细毛羊或半细毛羊，为毛纺工业提供更多的原料。这个工作已经进行几年了，以去年成绩为最大。去年全国适龄母羊约有三分之一是用细毛羊杂交配种的，杂交头数达九百二十八万多只，相当于1952年到1957年改良配种总数的一倍半，比1957年增加二点七倍。
    会议认为：各地党和政府加强了对绵羊改良工作的领导，是取得去年大跃进的基本原因。去年各地改良绵羊工作的县（旗），大部分都建立了绵羊改良委员会或指挥部，由党政负责同志亲自领导，并组织检查团深入基层督促检查；各地普遍建立了人工授精技术网，训练了大批人工授精员；同时发动了群众，因而改良绵羊工作进行得又普遍又迅速。
    会议认为：今年绵羊改良工作的条件更好。各地农牧民看到杂交所产的改良羊羔个大、毛厚、洁白细软，非常喜爱，提高了改良绵羊的积极性。同时有去年的经验和去年创造的一套物质基础、技术力量，只要好好依靠人民公社，抓得早、抓得好，今年一定能够取得更好的成绩。目前重要的是进一步把指标落实到公社和生产队，把种公羊养好，把人工授精的技术、器材等准备好，以便适时配种。
