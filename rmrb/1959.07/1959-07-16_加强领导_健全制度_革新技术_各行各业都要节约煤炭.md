Xinhua News Agency report: After the Fushun Power Plant mixed "water gangue" to burn boilers for power generation, it saved the country more than 54,600 tons of good coal in the first half of the year while overfulfilling the power generation plan by 2.5%.

"Water gangue" is the residue left over from the selection of fine powder, lump coal, and pulverized coal from raw coal in mines. Because it contains very little heat, Fushun Longfeng Mine and Laohutai Mine have to discard more than 2,500 tons every day. In order to make full use of this discarded resource, Fushun Power Plant cooperated with the coal mine as early as 1953 to recycle "water gangue" and mix it with good coal in a certain proportion to burn boilers for power generation. In January this year, 11.9% was mixed, in April it increased to 22.8%, and the average mixing in the first half of the year was 16.7%.

In the process of using "water gangue" for power generation, there were ideological obstacles. Some people believe that water gangue has a lot of ash, low heat, and cannot be burned, and only by eating "fine grains" and burning good coal can the boiler output be maintained; some individual employees are afraid of the trouble of operation, and their enthusiasm is not high, and so on. In response to these situations, the power plant's Party committee promptly organized a burning inferior coal group composed of workers, cadres, and technicians. Then, a vigorous upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution was launched throughout the plant, working hard in the direction of "burning inferior coal and generating more electricity." Facing the difficulties of high ash content, low melting point, high moisture content, frequent boiler fires, coking, tube blockage, pressure drop, and equipment wear during the initial stage of mixed combustion, power plant employees tried every means to innovate operating techniques and improve combustion equipment. As a result, the pressure was stabilized, the boiler efficiency was improved, equipment wear was prevented, and safe operation was ensured, which achieved good results.

Xinhua News Agency report: The Changsha Railway Bureau seized the key issue of serious coal consumption in the bureau's locomotive department and launched the "Welcoming the Tenth Anniversary of National Day, Saving One Million Kilograms of Coal" campaign, which was very effective. More than 80 youth locomotive teams in the bureau saved a total of 534,000 kilograms of raw coal for the country in more than two months from April to the end of June.

Various units carried out large-scale publicity activities. Yueyang Depot wasted more than 2,300 tons of coal in the first quarter, so it used cartoons to calculate detailed accounts, telling employees: These more than 2,300 tons of coal can supply a MK1 locomotive to haul 1,900 tons of goods, running 807 trips on the line of more than 100 kilometers from Yueyang to Changsha. Every piece of coal is exchanged for the sweat of the miners, and wasting coal is wasting the labor of the miners. These propagandas deeply touched the hearts of the workers. The concept of "saving is glory, waste is shameful" is gradually taking shape. Then, a competition for saving coal between cars and shifts was launched.

The leadership of this bureau paid attention to grasping the competition and setting up pacesetters in the coal-saving campaign. At first, Zhuzhou Locomotive Depot organized to learn from the Jin Guanren locomotive team and catch up with the Jin Guanren locomotive team. Later, many locomotive teams caught up with the Jin Guanren locomotive team. Then, the 533 Youth Train, which surpassed the Jin Guanren locomotive team, was set up as a pacesetter, and the youth were organized to learn from 533 and catch up with 533. The youth felt more and more energetic in the competition, and the number of youth coal-saving locomotive teams in the bureau quickly expanded from the original five to sixty-eight.

Various sections also established apprentice spare-time technical training classes, and organized excellent stokers to perform firing on various trains to improve the apprentice's operating skills and help the apprentices familiarize themselves with the line. The original three stokers of the 532 locomotive were all replaced by apprentices. Due to the low firing skills, 3,000 kilograms of coal were consumed in early April. In mid-April, through training apprentices and inviting excellent stokers to perform on the train, the technology was improved, and not only was there no waste in the last ten days of April, but also 2,000 kilograms were saved.

Now, the employees of the whole bureau have reversed the situation of serious coal consumption, and are striving to complete the target of saving one million kilograms of coal ahead of schedule to report good news to the Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 14th - The Yangtze River Shipping Administration has strengthened the management of coal consumption quotas for ships, and the amount of coal consumption has been continuously reduced. From January to May this year, the average monthly coal consumption decreased by 3.2% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and since June, coal consumption has been further reduced.

The Yangtze River Shipping Administration regards saving ship coal as an important part of the campaign to increase production and practice economy. They have formulated specific fuel consumption quotas based on the coal consumption per horsepower hour and voyage of the ships, and strengthened management. At the same time, they vigorously promoted the experience of using waste gas to increase boiler feed water temperature and using descaling agents to eliminate boiler scale to save coal. Now the boiler feed water temperature of each ship has been increased to about 105 degrees Celsius (for every 7 degrees increase in feed water temperature, 2% to 3% of coal can be saved), and boiler scale has also been basically eliminated.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 14th - Organs, enterprises, schools, and residents in various parts of Heilongjiang Province have achieved remarkable results in saving coal in the first half of the year. According to incomplete statistics, the province saved more than 230,000 tons of civilian coal in the first half of the year.

Heilongjiang Province is rich in coal resources, but leaders at all levels still attach great importance to saving coal. Relevant departments have also established special agencies to lead this work. The Party branch secretary of the Suihua County Coal, Construction, and Timber Supply Station conducted a pilot project in the Suihua Town People's Commune. With the help of masons, residents' group leaders, and activists in saving coal, the original stove was transformed into coal-saving "wind basin hanging egg stove" and "full red stove". Then, the residents were organized to visit the site. This experience was quickly accepted by 14,500 households, saving 2,400 tons of coal in the first half of the year alone. By the end of June, Harbin City had renovated 107 "universal stoves", more than 2,500 "package boiler stoves" and "boiler surrounding flue stoves", and 220,000 households had switched to other forms of coal-saving stoves, thereby saving a lot of coal. The canteen of Qiqihar Ceramic Factory implements dedicated fire-fighters, mastering the method of adding frequently, adding less, spreading evenly, and burning thoroughly before adding again, so that the smoke is white and the ash is white. The average coal consumption per person per day has been reduced from one catty and two taels in the past to about seven taels. (Attached photo)

  　长沙铁路局机务部门开展省煤运动
    长江航运局加强船舶用煤定额管理
  　黑龙江省各地改进炉灶节约民用煤
    本报讯　抚顺发电厂掺用“水矸子”烧锅炉发电后，上半年在超额2.5％完成发电计划的情况下，为国家节省了好煤五万四千六百多吨。
    “水矸子”是矿山从原煤中选出精粉、块煤、粉煤后剩下的渣滓，因为它含热量极少，抚顺龙凤矿、老虎台矿每天要遗弃两千五百多吨。为了充分利用这部分废弃资源，抚顺发电厂早在1953年就与煤矿协作，回收“水矸子”，按一定比例与好煤掺用着烧锅炉发电。今年1月份掺烧11.9％，4月份增加到22.8％，上半年平均掺烧16.7％。
    在利用“水矸子”发电过程中，并不是没有思想障碍的。有人认为水矸子灰分多、热量低、烧不上汽，只有吃“细粮”烧好煤，才能保持锅炉出力；也有个别职工怕操作起来麻烦，劲头不大，等等。针对这些情况，发电厂党委及时组织由工人、干部、技术人员参加的烧劣煤小组。接着全厂掀起了大闹技术革新和技术革命热潮，朝着“烧劣煤、多发电”这个方向努力。面对着灰分多、熔点低、水分大，在混烧初期经常出现锅炉灭火、结焦、堵管、气压下降和设备磨损等困难，发电厂职工千方百计地革新操作技术、改进燃烧设备。结果保持了气压稳定，提高了锅炉效率，防止了设备磨损，保证了安全运行。收到良好效果。
    本报讯　长沙铁路分局抓住全局机务部门严重费煤这一关键，发动机务部门开展“迎接国庆十周年，节煤一百万公斤”的活动，效果十分突出。全局八十多个青年机车从4月到6月底，两个多月共为国家节省原煤五十三万四千公斤。
    各单位开展了声势浩大的宣传活动。岳阳段一季度浪费煤二千三百多吨，就用漫画形式算细账，告诉职工：这二千三百多吨煤，可以供一台ㄇㄎ1型机车牵引一千九百吨货，在岳阳至长沙一百多公里的线路上运行八百零七趟。每一块煤炭都是矿工兄弟的汗水换来的，浪费煤就是浪费矿工兄弟的劳动。这些宣传，深深打动了职工的心。“节约光荣，浪费可耻”的观念逐步形成。接着就发动了一个车与车、班与班之间节约用煤的竞赛。
    这个局的领导上，在节约用煤活动中注意了抓竞赛，树标兵的工作。株洲机务段最初组织学习靳冠仁机班、赶上靳冠仁机班，后来许多机班都赶上了靳冠仁机班，接着又把超过了靳冠仁机班的533青年车立为标兵，又组织青年学习533赶上533。青年感到越比越有劲，全局由原来的五个青年节煤机班很快扩大到六十八个。
    各段还成立了徒工业余技术训练班，并组织优秀司炉到各车上作焚火表演，提高徒工操作技术，帮助徒工熟悉线路。532机车原来三个司炉都是由徒工代务的，由于焚火技术低，4月上旬费煤三千公斤，中旬通过训练徒工，请优秀司炉跟车表演后，改进提高了技术，下旬不仅不费，而且省了二千公斤。
    现在，全局职工已经扭转了严重费煤的局面，正在争取提前完成节煤百万公斤的指标，向党报捷。
    据新华社武汉14日电　长江航运管理局加强船舶用煤定额管理，煤的消耗量不断降低。今年1月至5月份，每月煤的消耗平均比去年第四季度降低3.2％，6月份以来煤的消耗又有进一步降低。
    长江航运局把节约船舶用煤当作增产节约运动的一项重要内容。他们根据船舶的单位马力小时用煤量和航次，制定了具体的燃料消耗定额，加强了管理。同时，他们大力推广了利用废气提高锅炉给水温度、使用去垢剂消灭锅炉水垢等节约用煤的经验。现在各船的锅炉给水温度都提高到摄氏一百零五度左右（按给水温度每提高七度，就可节约2％到3％的煤），锅炉水垢也基本消灭了。
    据新华社哈尔滨14日电　黑龙江省各地机关、企业、学校和居民上半年节约用煤成绩显著。据不完全统计，全省上半年共节约民用煤炭二十三万多吨。
    黑龙江省盛产煤炭，但是各级领导部门对于节约用煤仍然非常重视。有关部门并且成立了专门机构，领导这个工作。绥化县煤建木材供应站党支部书记到绥化镇人民公社进行试点，在瓦工、居民组长和节约用煤积极分子的帮助下，把原来的灶改成了省煤的“风盆吊蛋灶”和“满堂红灶”，然后组织居民到现场参观，这个经验很快地被一万四千五百户居民所接受，仅上半年就节约了二千四百吨煤炭。哈尔滨市到6月末已经改修了一百零七个“万能灶”、二千五百多个“包锅灶”和“锅周烟道灶”，并且有二十二万户居民改用了其它形式的省煤炉灶，从而节约了大量用煤。齐齐哈尔市陶瓷厂食堂实行专人烧火，掌握了勤添、少添、撒匀、烧透再添的方法，做到烟白、灰白，平均每人每天耗煤量由过去一斤一两降低到七两左右。（附图片）
