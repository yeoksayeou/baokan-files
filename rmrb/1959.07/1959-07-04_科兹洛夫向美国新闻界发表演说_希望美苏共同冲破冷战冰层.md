Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 3rd - According to TASS, Washington, 2nd: Soviet First Deputy Premier Kozlov and his entourage attended a banquet held in his honor by the National Press Club and the Overseas Writers Association of America at the "Statler" Hotel in Washington on the 2nd. At the banquet, Kozlov delivered a speech to three hundred prominent American and foreign commentators and journalists.

    Kozlov said that the time has come to permanently normalize the international situation. The prosperity and happiness of the people of all countries should not be built on the unstable foundation of the arms race and inciting hatred between the people of all countries, but should be built on mutual trust and recognition of the consolidation of the principle of peaceful coexistence of countries with different social and political systems.

    Kozlov emphasized that the fate of unprecedented development and universal peace opened up in world history today largely depends on the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States.

    Kozlov asked, is there a basis for establishing our relations on a solid foundation of peace and friendship? We in the Soviet Union believe that there is such a basis because we are convinced that the ordinary people of the United States, like the people of other countries, cherish and love peace. As for the Soviet people, the word war is the most hated. In the last war, our losses in terms of material and human resources were incomparable.

    Kozlov stressed that the difference in social systems between the Soviet Union and the United States cannot be an obstacle to the development of good-neighborly and sincere relations between our two peoples.

    Referring to his meeting with Eisenhower in Washington yesterday, Kozlov said that it is not enough to just hope for peace. Now, more than ever, it is necessary to actively fight for peace.

    Kozlov then described a series of proactive measures taken by the Soviet government in disarmament and other areas to strengthen peace and mutual understanding among nations. He also said that we are ready to withdraw our troops from the territories of the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and Poland if Western countries withdraw their troops from the territories of West Germany and other European allies of the United States. He emphasized that we are ready to completely prohibit and even destroy atomic and hydrogen weapons. We also propose to greatly reduce conventional armaments. We propose to your country to conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation. We propose to abolish existing military blocs, or at least conclude a treaty of non-aggression between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization, and completely eliminate the consequences of World War II - conclude a peace treaty with Germany and normalize the situation in West Berlin.

    Kozlov then talked about the Soviet proposals on the German issue and the Berlin issue. He pointed out that these proposals are not an ultimatum. He said that we propose that a pan-German committee composed of representatives from the two Germanies on an equal footing should work for a period of one year or a year and a half and establish temporary laws for West Berlin. If, during this period, the Germans do not reach an agreement with each other, do not sign a peace treaty, and the West Berlin issue cannot be resolved, then we propose to renegotiate the issue. We are convinced that we will eventually reach a correct understanding.

    Kozlov expressed satisfaction with the progress of scientific and technological exchanges between the Soviet Union and the United States. He concluded by saying that in recent years, the contacts between state and political activists and ordinary people in our two countries have been expanding. He expressed the hope that the contacts arranged between the two countries and peoples will be many small streams, and that when these streams converge into a torrent, they will completely break through the ice of the "Cold War" and sweep it away.

    科兹洛夫向美国新闻界发表演说
    希望美苏共同冲破冷战冰层
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿2日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席科兹洛夫及其随行人员2日在华盛顿“斯塔特勒”大旅馆出席了全国新闻俱乐部和美国海外作家协会为他举行的宴会。在宴会上，科兹洛夫向三百名美国和外国著名的评论员和记者发表了演说。
    科兹洛夫说，使国际局势永远正常化的时间已经到来了。各国人民的繁荣和幸福不应该建立在军备竞赛和煽动各国人民之间仇视的不稳固的基础上，而应该建立在互相信任、承认具有不同社会和政治制度的国家和平共处原则的巩固的基础上。
    科兹洛夫强调说，目前在世界历史中所开辟的空前发展的命运、普遍和平的命运，在很大程度上取决于苏美两国之间的相互关系。
    科兹洛夫问道，是否有基础使我们的关系建立在和平和友谊的可靠的基础上呢？我们苏联认为，这样的基础是有的，因为我们深信，美国的普通人像其他国家的人民一样珍惜和热爱和平。至于谈到苏联人民，战争这个字眼是最被痛恨不过的字。在上次大战中，我们在物质和人力方面所受到的损失是无可比拟的。
    科兹洛夫强调说，苏美两国间社会制度的不同不能成为发展我们两国人民间睦邻关系和真诚关系的障碍。
    科兹洛夫在谈到他昨天在华盛顿同艾森豪威尔的会谈时说，目前只是希望和平是不够的。现在比任何时候都更有必要积极地为和平而斗争。
    科兹洛夫接着叙述了苏联政府为了加强和平和各国人民取得互相谅解而在裁军等方面采取的一系列主动措施。他并且说，我们准备从德意志民主共和国、匈牙利和波兰领土上撤出自己的军队，如果西方国家从西德和美国其他欧洲盟国的领土上撤出自己的军队的话。他着重说，我们准备完全禁止，甚至销毁原子武器和氢武器。我们还建议大大裁减常规军备。我们向你们国家建议缔结友好和合作条约。我们建议取消现有的军事集团，或者最低限度缔结北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织之间的互不侵犯条约，彻底消除第二次世界大战的后果——缔结对德和约和使西柏林局势正常化。
    科兹洛夫然后谈到苏联就德国问题和柏林问题提出的建议。他指出，这些建议不是最后通牒。他说，我们建议在对等基础由两个德国的代表组成的全德委员会的工作期限为一年或者一年半，并且确立西柏林的临时法律。如果在这段期间内，德国人相互之间没有达成协议，没有签订和约，以致西柏林问题不能解决，那么，我们建议重新就这个问题举行谈判。我们深信，我们终于会得到正确的谅解。
    科兹洛夫对苏美两国在科学技术交流方面的进展表示满意。他最后说，近几年来，我们两国的国家和政治活动家之间以及普通人之间的接触在日益扩大。他表示希望，两个国家和人民之间所安排的接触将是许多细小的溪流，这些溪流汇合成为一条巨流后，将彻底冲破“冷战”的冰层并把它卷走。
