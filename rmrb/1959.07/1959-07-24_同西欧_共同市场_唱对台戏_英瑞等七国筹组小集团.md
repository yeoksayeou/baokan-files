Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd, Stockholm dispatch: The ministerial meeting of the so-called "Small Free Trade Area" of seven countries including Britain, Denmark, Norway, Austria, Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland, held near Stockholm, closed on the evening of the 21st after two days of meetings. A communique was issued afterwards, formally recommending that their governments "establish a European Free Trade Association among the seven countries."

The communique stated: "The ministers agreed on the plan drafted for the establishment of a European Free Trade Association, they decided to publish this plan, and have designated officials to draft a convention based on this draft plan and in accordance with the discussions held at the ministerial meeting, and to submit this document to the ministers in October 1959."

The communique also stated that at the same time it would seek "to hold negotiations as early as possible" with the "European Economic Community" (i.e., the "Common Market") and other countries participating in the European Economic Cooperation Organization in order to achieve "the elimination of trade barriers and the establishment of a multilateral alliance including all members of the European Economic Cooperation Organization."

The communique also mentioned that the meeting had invited the Finnish Minister of Commerce and Industry "to make a statement to the meeting on the attitude of the Finnish government towards the plan to establish a free trade association," but the minister stated that, given that the Finnish government had not had the opportunity to understand the discussions on the above plan, "it is currently not possible for Finland to determine its final attitude."

    同西欧“共同市场”唱对台戏
    英瑞等七国筹组小集团
    新华社22日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：在斯德哥尔摩附近举行的英、丹、挪、奥、葡、瑞典和瑞士等七国的所谓“小自由贸易区”部长级会议在举行两天会议后在21日晚间闭幕，会后发表公报，正式建议它们的政府“在七国之间建立一个欧洲自由贸易联盟”。
    会议公报说：“部长们同意为了建立一个欧洲自由贸易联盟而草拟的计划，他们决定公布这项计划，并且已经指定官员们以这项计划草案为基础，按照部长级会议上所进行的讨论来草拟一项公约，在1959年10月把这一文件提交给这些部长们。”
    公报还表示，同时并将谋求同“欧洲经济集团”（即“共同市场”）和其他参加欧洲经济合作局的国家“尽早举行谈判”，以达到“取消贸易壁垒和建立一个包括欧洲经济合作局全体成员国的多边联盟”的目的。
    公报还提到，这次会议曾邀请芬兰工商部长“就芬兰政府对于建立一个自由贸易联盟的计划的态度向会议发表一项声明”，但是，这位部长表示，鉴于芬兰政府没有机会了解关于上述计划的讨论情况，“目前芬兰还不可能确定它的最后态度”。
