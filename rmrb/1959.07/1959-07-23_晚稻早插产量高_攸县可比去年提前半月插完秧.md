    Early Planting of Late Rice Results in High Yields
    You County Expected to Finish Transplanting Half a Month Earlier Than Last Year
    (Our Dispatch) Hunan's You County, while rushing to harvest early rice, is rationally organizing its labor force to transplant late rice with guaranteed quality and quantity, striving for late rice yields to surpass those of early rice. It is estimated that transplanting can be basically completed around "Great Heat" (大暑), about half a month earlier than in previous years.
    This year, You County planted a total of 384,400 mu of double-cropping early rice. Except for 3,800 mu that are planned to be converted to autumn sweet potatoes due to water conservancy limitations, the remaining fields are prepared for transplanting double-cropping late rice. "Spring struggles for the day, summer struggles for the hour." Ensuring timely transplanting according to the season is one of the crucial keys to striving for a bumper harvest of double-cropping late rice. However, a few commune members felt that the early rice harvest was good and that the rush harvesting was very tight, so transplanting late rice could only be done slowly, doing as much as possible. According to the instructions of the You County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, various communes and brigades helped commune members recall the situation of late rice transplanting last year to reverse this complacent and lax thinking. The Lema Brigade of the Xinshi Commune, in its discussion, cited the example of three plots of land in the Malong Production Team to illustrate the necessity of seizing the season. These three plots of land had roughly the same natural and cultivation conditions, but the yields differed due to different transplanting seasons. The 61 mu of Zhangjialong were transplanted five days before "Great Heat", with an average yield of 580 jin per mu; the 37 mu of Xiejia Field were transplanted four days after "Great Heat", with an average yield of 490 jin per mu; the 31 mu of Miaoxialong were transplanted close to "Beginning of Autumn", with a yield of 380 jin per mu. After discussion, the commune members further realized the importance of seizing the season. In order to transplant quickly and well, all localities have rationally arranged their labor force. At present, 45% of the labor force invested in the "double rush" is specifically responsible for rushing to transplant. They are organized into plowing, harrowing, fertilizer transportation, and transplanting groups, implementing a responsibility system of fixed personnel, fixed tasks, fixed time, and fixed quality, plowing one field after harvesting it, and transplanting one field after plowing it. In many places, the fields are yellow in the morning and green in the evening. Of the 176 brigades in the county, 32 brigades are particularly short of labor and cannot finish transplanting before July 25. The communes organized cooperation and implemented "equivalent exchange," transferring 5,700 people from 38 brigades with smaller "double rush" tasks and faster progress to provide support. To solve the difficulties of insufficient cattle power in some brigades, 320 cattle were also transferred from 29 teams with surplus cattle.
    On the eve of the rush harvesting and rush transplanting, the You County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party led the commune members of the entire county to earnestly summarize the experience of the bumper harvest of early rice and last year's late rice, in order to change people's thinking that "late rice does not need fertilizer, it all depends on autumn rain," as well as the habit of extensive cultivation. Under the encouragement of the slogan "late rice surpasses early rice," all localities paid great attention to quality in transplanting late rice. They focused on three aspects: First, applying sufficient base fertilizer. Before the "double rush," the entire county launched a campaign to accumulate fertilizer in a concentrated effort, preparing more than 150 dan of fertilizer for each mu of late rice. Currently, they have organized 11,000 laborers and 7,500 vehicles to concentrate on transporting and applying fertilizer. The late rice that has already been transplanted has generally received about 100 dan of base fertilizer per mu, and lean fields have received nearly 200 dan, with lime generally added to accelerate the decomposition of fertilizer and the rotting of rice stubble. Second, doing a good job in plowing and harrowing. The entire county organized 20,000 experienced plowing and harrowing personnel to form 5,300 plowing and harrowing groups, generally achieving one plowing and two harrowings, three passes with a leveling roller, and one pass with a ladder; the more than 40,000 mu of fields with shallow mud feet were generally plowed one inch deeper than before. Third, grasping rational close planting. Based on the characteristics that the growing period of late rice is longer than that of early rice, the tillering ability of the varieties is stronger, as well as deep plowing, fertilization, and other conditions, considering the experience of close planting of early rice, most of the late rice is planted at 5×7 inches, 6×7 inches, and a few are planted at 4×6 inches, 4×7 inches, 6×8 inches, with about ten seedlings per hill.
    At present, the "double rush" battle in this county is entering a climax, and most communes can basically complete the transplanting of late rice before "Great Heat".

### 晚稻早插产量高  攸县可比去年提前半月插完秧

    晚稻早插产量高
    攸县可比去年提前半月插完秧
    本报讯　湖南攸县在抢收早稻的同时，合理安排劳力，保质保量地抢插晚稻，力争晚稻赛过早稻。预计“大暑”前后可以基本插完，比往年提前半月左右。
    今年，攸县共种双季早稻三十八万四千亩，这些田中除三千八百亩因受水利条件限制，准备改种秋红薯外，其他的田准备全部插双季晚稻。“春争日，夏争时”，保证按季节插上秧，是争取双季晚稻丰收的重要关键之一。但有少数社员觉得早稻丰收了，抢收的工夫又很紧，插晚稻只能慢慢来，插多少算多少。各公社、大队根据中共攸县县委的指示，帮助社员回忆去年插晚稻的情况，扭转这种自满松气思想。新市公社勒马大队在讨论中，举了马龙生产队三片田为例，说明必须抢住季节。这三片田自然条件和耕作条件大体相同，只是因为插秧季节不同，产量也就不同。张家垅六十一亩田是“大暑”前五天插的，平均亩产五百八十斤；谢家场三十七亩田是“大暑”后四天插的，平均亩产四百九十斤；庙下垅三十一亩田在“立秋”边才插，亩产三百八十斤。经过讨论之后，社员们进一步认识到抢住季节的重要性。为了快插、插好，各地合理安排了劳动力。目前，全县投入“双抢”的劳动力中，有45％专门负责抢插。他们分别组成犁耙、运肥、插秧小组，实行定人、定任务、定时间、定质量的责任制，收完一丘翻一丘，翻完一丘插一丘，许多地方都是早上一片黄，晚上一片青。全县一百七十六个大队，有三十二个大队劳力特别紧张，7月25日以前不能结束插秧。各公社便组织协作，实行“等价交换”，从三十八个“双抢”任务较小进度较快的大队中，抽调了五千七百人去支援。为了解决某些大队牛力不足的困难，又从二十九个耕牛有余的队调出了耕牛三百二十头。
    在抢收抢插前夕，中共攸县县委领导全县社员认真总结了早稻和去年晚稻丰产的经验，借以改变人们认为“晚稻不用粪，全靠秋雨喷”的思想，以及耕作粗放的习惯。在“晚稻超早稻”这一口号的鼓舞下，各地在插晚稻中，都十分注意质量。他们着重抓了三条：第一是施足底肥。“双抢”前全县开展了一次突击积肥运动，为每亩晚稻准备了一百五十多担肥料。当前，他们组织了一万一千个劳动力，七千五百部车子，突击运肥施肥。已插下去的晚稻，一般每亩施了底肥一百来担，瘦田施了近二百担，普遍加了石灰，以加速肥效的分解和禾兜的腐烂。第二是搞好犁耙工夫。全县组织二万来名有经验的犁耙手，组成五千三百个犁耙小组，一般都做到了一犁两耙，打三道蒲滚，拖一道楼梯；对四万多亩泥脚浅的田，普遍比原来耕深一寸。第三是抓合理密植。根据晚稻生长期较早稻长，品种分蘖能力较强的特点，以及深耕、施肥等情况，考虑早稻密植经验之后，晚稻大部分插5×7寸，6×7寸，少数的插4×6寸，4×7寸，6×8寸，每兜插十来根。
    目前，这个县的“双抢”战斗正进入高潮，大部分公社在大暑以前可基本插完晚稻。
