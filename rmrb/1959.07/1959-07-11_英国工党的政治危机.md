    Political Crisis in the British Labour Party
    By Our Correspondent Pan Fei
    The British Transport and General Workers' Union, with 1.25 million members, has shaken off the shackles of the Labour Party's right-wing leaders and passed a resolution on July 9 calling for a halt to the testing and use of nuclear weapons. This resolution rejected the so-called "non-nuclear weapons club" program recently adopted by the Labour Party and the British Trades Union Congress, and opposed basing Britain's defense policy on "nuclear deterrence." The resolution stated that if a Labour government were in power, Britain would completely cease the testing and production of nuclear weapons, stop aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs from patrolling in the air, oppose the establishment of missile bases in Britain, and, if war occurred, Britain would never be the first to use nuclear weapons and would refuse to use British territory to launch such weapons.
    The policy on nuclear weapons has become one of the issues of intense debate in the British trade union movement and Labour Party organizations. As early as the beginning of June, the annual meeting of the British Municipal and General Workers' Union, with about 800,000 members, passed a resolution calling for Britain to stop manufacturing nuclear weapons and ban the use of nuclear weapons on British territory. This event greatly shocked the Labour Party leaders, because the spirit of this resolution was contrary to the Labour Party's current policy; moreover, this union has always been controlled by the right-wing leaders of the union, but under the pressure of union representatives from the grassroots level, the annual meeting actually passed such a resolution. Since then, Labour Party leaders have been actively trying to deal with this situation. After several twists and turns, at the end of June, a new program was formulated by the Labour Party National Executive Committee and the General Council of the British Trades Union Congress, namely the establishment of the so-called "non-nuclear weapons club." This means that the Soviet Union and the United States will control nuclear weapons, and Britain will hand over its existing weapons to the United States. The premise for doing so is that all other countries in the world will no longer produce or attempt to produce nuclear weapons. This plan is not only unrealistic but also hypocritical, because the Labour Party does not oppose the "deterrence policy," does not want to fundamentally abolish nuclear bombs, and does not oppose the United States using such weapons to worsen the international situation. When explaining this program, Gaitskell and Bevan repeatedly stated that the Labour Party was wholeheartedly loyal to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On July 8, when the Conservative government announced that most of the 200 fighter-bombers stationed in France by the United States that could carry atomic weapons would be transferred to Britain, the Labour Party leaders did not even make a gesture of "opposition."
    The resolution of the British Transport and General Workers' Union was passed at the union's annual meeting. Of the 750 delegates attending the meeting, only a mere 50 voted against it. This most powerfully shows how deeply the ordinary members of the British Labour Party hate the "deterrence policy" and how dissatisfied they are with the Labour Party's right-wing leaders. Before the start of the annual meeting, Labour Party leaders exerted various pressures on it, threatening that "the Labour Party will split," "will cause the Labour Party to suffer defeat in the general election," and so on. However, all these things have not been able to change the situation.
    The mainstay of the British Labour Party is the British Trades Union Congress, which has more than 8 million members. The mainstay of the British Trades Union Congress is the seven major trade unions, each with hundreds of thousands to millions of members. Now, two of the seven largest trade unions have parted ways and refused to accept the Labour Party's foreign policy. This puts the Labour Party's right-wing leaders in an unprecedentedly serious situation. The "Daily Express" commented that with the actions of the Transport and General Workers' Union, the Labour Party's local organizations may also see a "rebellion" against Gaitskell.
    The Labour Party is going through a rare political crisis. The root cause of this crisis is the Labour Party's unpopular domestic and foreign policies.

    英国工党的政治危机
    本报记者　潘非
    拥有一百二十五万会员的英国运输与普通工人工会，摆脱了工党右翼领袖的羁绊，在7月9日通过决议，要求停止试验和使用核武器。这个决议拒绝了工党和英国职工大会在最近通过的所谓“非核子武器俱乐部”的纲领，并反对把英国的国防政策建立在“核威慑”的基础之上。决议指出，如果工党政府当政，英国将彻底地停止试验和生产核武器，停止携有氢弹的飞机在空中巡逻，反对在英国建立导弹基地，如果战争发生，英国决不首先使用核武器，并且也拒绝利用英国国土发射这种武器。
    对于核武器的政策，成为英国工会运动和工党组织中激烈争辩的问题之一。早在6月初，拥有约八十万会员的英国市政与普通工人联合会的年会，通过了一个要求英国停止制造核武器并禁止在英国领土上使用核武器的决议。这一事件曾使工党领袖大为震惊。因为这个决议的精神是同工党的现行政策相违背的；更因为这个工会始终控制在工会的右翼头子的手中，但在来自基层的工会代表的压力下，年会竟然通过了这样一个决议。自此以后，工党领袖们就积极设法来应付这种局面。经过了几番周折，在6月底，由工党全国执委会和英国职工大会总理事会制订出了一个新的纲领，即建立所谓“非核武器俱乐部”。这就是说，由苏联和美国来掌握核武器，英国将把它已有的这种武器交给美国。这样做的前提是：世界其他各国，都不再生产或试图生产核武器。这个计划不仅是不现实的，而且是虚伪的，因为工党并不反对“威慑政策”，并不想根本废除核子炸弹，并不反对美国利用这种武器来恶化国际局势。盖茨克尔和比万在解释这个纲领时，口口声声说工党对北大西洋公约组织忠心耿耿。7月8日，保守党政府宣布美国驻在法国的二百架可以携带原子武器的战斗轰炸机，大部分将转移到英国来时，工党的领袖连表示一下“反对”的姿态都没有作。
    英国运输与普通工人工会的这个决议，是在该工会的年会上通过的。出席会议的七百五十名代表中，只有廖廖五十人投反对票。这就最有力地表明了英国工党的普通成员，对于“威慑政策”是多么深恶痛绝，对于工党右翼领袖是多么不满。在年会开始前。工党领袖曾对它施加种种压力，威胁说“工党将会分裂”，“将使工党在大选中遭致失败”，等等。但是，所有这些：都没有能够改变局势。
    英国工党的支柱是英国职工大会，它拥有八百多万会员。英国职工大会的支柱是七个大工会，它们各有几十万到上百万的会员。现在，这七个大工会中有两个最大的工会分道扬鏣，拒绝接受工党的外交政策。这就使得工党右翼头子面临着一个空前严重的局面。“每日快报”评论说：随着运输和一般工会的行动，工党的地方组织，也可能出现对盖茨克尔的“反叛”。
    工党正经历着一次少有的政治危机。发生这一危机的根源，是工党不得人心的对内对外政策。
