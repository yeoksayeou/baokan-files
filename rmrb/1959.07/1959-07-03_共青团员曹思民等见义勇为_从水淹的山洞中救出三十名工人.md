Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 2nd. Communist Youth League members Cao Simin, Yang Jilin, and youth You Jinfeng, along with seven others from the Third Stone Construction Team of the Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Hebei, risked their lives to rescue thirty workers from a cave flooded by a mountain torrent.

On June 11th, Handan region experienced torrential rains, and mountain torrents erupted. The floodwater rushed down from the mountaintop, trapping thirty workers who were digging channels and ditches at Shiling Mountain inside a cave. Upon hearing the news, Communist Youth League members and youth from the Handan Third Stone Construction Team immediately rushed to the rescue. Cao Simin, a Communist Youth League member who had recently been discharged from the hospital, saw the critical situation and immediately jumped into the water without regard for his own safety. Immediately following him, You Jinfeng, Yang Jilin, and seven other League members and youths also jumped into the water. After carrying five workers out of the water, Cao Simin fainted at the cave entrance due to physical weakness. When everyone went to help him, he said, "I'm alright, hurry and save the workers." They fought the mountain torrents for an hour and finally carried all thirty workers, who had been submerged and rendered unconscious by the floodwater, out of the cave one by one.

After emergency treatment, twenty-seven of the thirty workers were out of danger. The remaining three, though rescued from the cave, unfortunately died despite all emergency efforts.

The exemplary act of courage displayed by Cao Simin, You Jinfeng, and others has been commended and rewarded by the Handan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Shexian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Shexian People's Committee.

    共青团员曹思民等见义勇为
    从水淹的山洞中救出三十名工人
    新华社天津2日电　河北邯郸专署第三石方施工大队的共青团员曹思民、杨吉林和青年尤金峰等十人，冒着生命危险，从被山洪淹没的山洞里抢救出了三十名工人。
    6月11日，邯郸地区暴雨，山洪暴发。洪水从山顶猛冲下来，正在石岭山开渠打沟的三十名工人，被洪水堵淹在山洞内。邯郸第三石方施工大队的共青团员和青年闻讯后，立即跑来抢救。刚出医院不久的共青团员曹思民，看到情况危急，当即奋不顾身地首先纵身跳到水里。紧接着尤金峰、杨吉林等九名团员和青年也都跳进水里。曹思民从水里背出了五名工人后，因身体虚弱晕倒在洞口，当大家去扶他时，他说：“我不要紧，快去救工人。”他们同山洪搏斗了一个小时，终于将三十名已被洪水淹得不省人事的工人，一一背出了洞口。
    这三十名工人经过急救，有二十七人转危为安，其余三人虽已抢救出洞，但因急救无效而不幸牺牲。
    曹思民、尤金峰等人这种见义勇为的模范事迹，受到了共青团邯郸地委、中共涉县县委、涉县人民委员会的表扬和奖励。
