Simultaneously Develop Light and Heavy Industries; Emphasize Both Quantity and Quality
Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Calls on Factories to Mobilize the Masses to Tap Potential

(Our newspaper's Shanghai dispatch, July 1st) The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a meeting of responsible cadres from various industrial departments to arrange industrial production for the city's third quarter. According to the arrangements made at the Municipal Party Committee meeting, Shanghai's industrial production in the third quarter of this year will see even greater growth than in the second quarter, with particular attention paid to arranging production for market supply. Due to the development of production and construction, steel production in the third quarter will significantly increase compared to the second quarter. For the needs of complete sets of products and equipment maintenance in the machinery and electronics industry, the manufacturing quantity of accessories and spare parts will greatly increase compared to the first half of the year. For certain weak links in complete sets of equipment, such as relays, relevant departments have taken measures such as adjusting factory buildings and equipment, and organizing production collaboration to expand production. The production growth of light industrial products is most prominent, with paper, soap, and other products increasing by 30% to 60%, and bicycles, enamel washbasins, gold pens, film, and sewing machines increasing by one to four times.

In the first half of this year, employees in various industrial departments of the city extensively carried out mass movements to increase production, improve quality, and practice strict economy, striving to overcome difficulties in raw material supply and other aspects, and accumulated a lot of experience. As a result, the total industrial output value for the first half of the year has completed 42% of the annual plan, an increase of 58% compared to the same period last year. The third quarter is a decisive season for completing the annual Great Leap Forward plan. Therefore, the Municipal Party Committee requires cadres and employees in various industrial departments to continue to exert full effort, seize the opportunity, and diligently and conscientiously tap production potential to lay the foundation for striving to complete the annual Great Leap Forward plan.

The Municipal Party Committee believes that due to the foundation laid in the first half of the year, coupled with the further development of industrial and agricultural production across the country, there are more favorable conditions for doing a good job in production in the second half of the year. In order to increase the production of more industrial products for the country as much as possible under existing conditions, the Municipal Party Committee requires various industrial departments to further launch mass movements to increase production, practice economy, and conserve raw materials in the third quarter. On June 26th, the Municipal Party Committee's Industrial Production Committee and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened a city-wide activist meeting on conserving coal, coke, and electricity, attended by more than 3,000 people. Fourteen units, including Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2, jointly proposed at the meeting to launch a red banner competition for conserving coal, coke, and electricity, and relevant factories and enterprises throughout the city responded enthusiastically. On the 27th, the Municipal People's Committee then convened a meeting of responsible persons from various districts, counties, and bureaus, to deploy a mass waste paper recycling movement throughout the city to support the increased production needs of the paper industry in the third quarter. In terms of raw materials, a broader mass movement to open up new sources of supply and reduce consumption has been further launched throughout the city.

In addition, the Municipal Party Committee proposed that various industrial departments should continue to strive to improve product quality, reduce costs, and pay attention to safe production in the third quarter. To this end, the Municipal Party Committee requires all factories and enterprises to mobilize the masses to further improve rules and regulations, improve management level, strengthen economic accounting, and do a good job in equipment maintenance and heatstroke prevention. Currently, various departments are making specific deployments in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee. (Attached image)

    轻重工业并进　产量质量并重
    上海市委号召各厂发动群众挖掘潜力
    本报上海1日电　中共上海市委最近召集各工业部门负责干部会议，对全市第三季度的工业生产作了安排。根据市委会议的安排，今年第三季度上海市工业生产将比第二季度有更大增长，并特别注意安排了市场供应方面的生产。由于生产和建设的发展，第三季度钢产量将比第二季度有很大增长。机电工业为了产品成套和设备维护的需要，配件、备品的制造数量将比上半年大大增加；对于成套设备中的某些薄弱环节，例如继电器等，有关部门已采取调整厂房、设备、组织生产协作等措施，扩大生产。轻工业产品的生产增长最为突出，纸张、肥皂等增长30％到60％，自行车、搪瓷脸盆、金笔、胶卷、缝纫机等增长幅度达一倍到四倍。
    今年上半年，全市各工业部门职工曾广泛开展高产、优质、厉行节约的群众增产节约运动，努力克服原材料供应等方面的困难，积累了很多经验，结果，上半年工业生产总值已经完成全年计划42％，比去年同期增长58％。第三季度是完成全年跃进计划的决定性的季节，因此，市委要求各工业部门干部和职工继续鼓足干劲，抓紧时机，努力地认真地挖掘生产潜力，为争取完成全年跃进计划打下基础。
    市委认为：由于有了上半年的基础，加上全国各地工农业生产的进一步发展，搞好下半年生产具有更多有利条件。为了在现有条件下尽可能的为国家增产更多的工业品，市委要求各工业部门在第三季度内进一步大搞增产节约原材料的群众运动。6月26日，市委工业生产委员会和市工会联合会共同召开了有三千多人参加的全市节约用煤、用焦、用电活动分子大会。上钢二厂等十四个单位在会上联名倡议开展节约煤、焦、电力的红旗竞赛，全市各有关工厂企业单位纷起响应。27日，市人民委员会接着召开全市各区、县、局的负责人会议，布置在全市范围内开展一个群众性的废纸回收运动，支援造纸工业第三季度增产的需要。在原材料方面，一个更广泛的开源节流的群众运动已在全市进一步展开。
  此外，市委提出在第三季度内各工业部门应继续努力提高产品质量，降低成本，注意安全生产。为此，市委要求各工厂企业发动群众，进一步健全规章制度，提高管理水平，加强经济核算，并作好设备维修和防暑降温等工作。现在，各部门正根据市委指示进行具体部署。（附图片）
