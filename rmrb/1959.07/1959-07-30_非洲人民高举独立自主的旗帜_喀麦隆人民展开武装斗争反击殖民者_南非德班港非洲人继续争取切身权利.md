Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 28th - Abel, Vice Chairman of the Cameroonian People's Union, stated in a communiqué issued here today that the explosive situation in Cameroon is currently caused by a conflict between two trends. One trend is the legitimate desire of the Cameroonian people for unity and independence, and the other trend is the administration's attempt to crush the nationalist movement and the Cameroonian People's Union through barbaric suppression.

According to materials provided by the Cameroonian People's Union, the French colonial authorities have executed fourteen freedom fighters in less than two weeks. After five nationalists were executed in the market of Bafoussam on July 11, another nine nationalists were killed in the same way. The communiqué said that the number of people killed has undoubtedly exceeded this number. The Cameroonian People's Union also said that, in addition, the French authorities recently deported more than 20 patriots.

The communiqué said that, on the other hand, the Cameroonian people have retaliated against every act of suppression. Soldiers of the Cameroonian National Liberation Army operating in the Bamileke region have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. In the center of Yakonde, personnel of the National Liberation Army once attacked the French army's supply depot in broad daylight and seized all the weapons and ammunition there.

The communiqué condemned the British colonialists for colluding with the French to arrest Cameroonian patriots who had taken refuge in British Cameroon and hand them over to the French authorities. The communiqué said that this crazy practice by the British and French colonialists will only strengthen the Cameroonian people's armed struggle. The French colonialists should know that in the era of Bandung, the African people will never be subjected to such colonial rule forever, even if this rule is disguised as the "French Community." The communiqué concluded by saying that they will carry out the struggle for national liberation and independence to the end.

In another statement, the Cameroonian People's Union welcomed the inclusion of the Cameroonian issue on the agenda of the special meeting of independent African countries to be held in Monrovia on August 4. It said that this shows that the issue is being taken seriously.

Xinhua News Agency, July 29th - Johannesburg News: Africans in the Cato Manor area of Durban, who recently held large-scale demonstrations against the racial discrimination policies of the South African Federal White Government, continue to fight for their rights.

It is reported that they recently passed a "charter" with twenty-five points, demanding that the Federal Government: (1) should investigate the demands of the Africans and meet these demands as soon as possible; (2) must eliminate the unfavorable material conditions in Cato Manor; (3) before moving people to residential areas like "KwaMashu" (another African residential area on the northern outskirts of Durban), it should first consult with representatives of the 80,000 Africans in Cato Manor.

According to news from Pretoria, the capital of the South African Federation, some Africans in that city who were unreasonably injured by the Federal Police have filed a claim with the Federal Minister of Justice, Swart, for nearly 33,000 pounds in compensation. These people were injured by more than 60 armed police officers on February 26 this year when they participated in a rally in the town of Lady Selborne on the outskirts of Pretoria to protest against the Federal authorities' issuance of "identity cards" to African women.

    喀麦隆人民展开武装斗争反击殖民者
    南非德班港非洲人继续争取切身权利
    新华社开罗28日电　喀麦隆人民联盟副主席阿贝尔今天在这里发表的一项公报中指出，喀麦隆目前的爆炸性的局势是由于两种趋向的冲突造成的，一种趋向是喀麦隆人民要求统一和独立的正当愿望，另一种趋向是行政当局要想用野蛮的镇压手段来摧毁民族主义运动和喀麦隆人民联盟。
    据喀麦隆人民联盟提供的材料，法国殖民当局在不到两个星期的时间内处死了十四名自由战士。在五个民族主义者7月11日在巴弗萨姆的市场上被处死以后，又有九名民族主义者以同样的方式被杀害。公报说，被杀害的人数无疑已经超过了这个数目。喀麦隆人民联盟又说，此外，法国当局最近又把二十多个爱国者驱逐出境。
    公报说，在另一方面，喀麦隆人民对每一次镇压行动都予以反击。在巴米累克地区活动的喀麦隆民族解放军的士兵使敌人遭受了巨大的伤亡。在雅孔兹中心，民族解放军的人员曾经在白天进攻法国军队的军需库，缴获了那里的一切武器和弹药。
    公报谴责英国殖民主义者同法国人串通一气，逮捕在英属喀麦隆避难的喀麦隆爱国者，并且把他们移交给法国当局。公报说，英法殖民主义者这种疯狂做法，只会加强喀麦隆人民的武装斗争。法国殖民主义者应该知道，在万隆时代里，非洲人民决不会永远受这种殖民统治的，即使这种统治是以“法兰西共同体”为掩饰的。公报最后说，他们将把争取民族解放和独立的斗争进行到底。
    喀麦隆人民联盟在另一个声明中，对于喀麦隆问题被列入即将于8月4日在蒙罗维亚召开的非洲独立国家特别会议的议程一事表示欢迎。它说，这表明了这个问题受到重视。
    新华社29日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：不久前举行大示威反对南非联邦白人政府种族歧视政策的德班卡托马诺尔地区的非洲人继续为自己的权利而斗争。
    据报道，他们最近通过了一个有二十五点的“宪章”，要求联邦政府：（一）应该调查非洲人的要求，尽快地满足这些要求；（二）必须消除卡托马诺尔的不利的物质条件；（三）在把人民迁往像“克瓦马舒”（德班北郊的另一个非洲人居住区）这样的居民区去之前，应该先同卡托马诺尔八万非洲人的代表进行磋商。
    另据来自南非联邦首都比勒陀尼亚的消息报道，那个城市一些曾经被联邦警察无理打伤的非洲人，已经向联邦司法部长斯瓦特提出给予将近三万三千镑赔偿费的要求。这些人是今年2月26日在比勒陀尼亚城郊的雷迪塞耳博尼镇参加抗议联邦当局对非洲妇女颁发“身份证”的集会时，被六十多名武装警察打伤的。
