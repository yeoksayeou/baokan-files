Hanoi News: While vigorously developing the agricultural cooperativization movement, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is actively carrying out the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce and handicrafts.

The socialist transformation of private industry and commerce is being carried out on a large scale, first in the capital of the Republic. The city of Hanoi is taking the lead in launching a high tide, aiming to implement joint state-private ownership in 90% of the city's private industrial and commercial enterprises and 75% of private service industries by the end of this year. In terms of handicrafts, according to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, by late May of this year, 46% of handicraft workers in North Vietnam had joined various cooperative organizations. According to the national plan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, by the end of this year, handicraft workers participating in cooperative organizations will account for 80% of all handicraft workers in North Vietnam, with 50% joining handicraft cooperatives.

Private industry and commerce and handicrafts account for a large proportion of the national economy of North Vietnam. At the end of 1958, the output value of private capitalist industry and commerce and handicraft products accounted for 64.1% of the total industrial output value of North Vietnam, and the output value of handicraft products also reached more than half of the total industrial output value. In terms of commerce, last year, the retail sales of private commerce accounted for 45.5% of the total retail sales in the North. Therefore, accelerating their socialist transformation is of great significance for realizing the current socialist revolutionary tasks in North Vietnam.

In order to realize the transformation of private industry and commerce, the Vietnamese government is vigorously promoting forms such as processing, ordering, distribution, and agency sales, while also starting pilot projects for joint state-private ownership. In the first four months of this year, eighteen enterprises and units, including bowl kilns, pine oil presses, knitting factories, machine factories, brick kilns, sawmills, tanneries, and printing factories, have been converted into joint state-private enterprises; currently, the work of joint state-private ownership is expanding its pilot scope. In Hanoi, fifty-eight industrial enterprises in eight industries, including hardware, sawmills, machine-made bricks and tiles, chemicals, printing, film, textiles, and cloth shoes, have begun to implement joint state-private ownership.

In May of this year, the Vietnamese Labor Party issued a communique from the Sixteenth (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central Committee, assessing the achievements of past transformations of the capitalist economy. The meeting believed that since the restoration of peace, thanks to the education and assistance of the Party and the government, the bourgeois elements in North Vietnam have accepted socialist transformation to varying degrees and have made much progress, and have made certain contributions in the cause of restoring and initially developing the national economy. In recent years, private capitalist industry and commerce has undergone preliminary transformation under low-level and intermediate forms of state capitalism, thus limiting the negative and backward aspects of capitalist industry and commerce, and promoting the positive aspects beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. On the other hand, the increasing development of state-owned and cooperative economic components has created favorable conditions for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

The meeting put forward the task of vigorously implementing the policy of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. It also pointed out that for bourgeois elements, it is necessary to strengthen unity and education within the Fatherland Front, and while transforming capitalist enterprises, appropriate arrangements should be made for the lives and work of bourgeois elements, using their technology and experience in managing enterprises, so that they have the conditions to transform themselves into laborers who serve the motherland and the people.

Currently, many private industrialists and businessmen in Hanoi are applying to the government, requesting immediate approval for their joint state-private ownership, creating a gratifying atmosphere on the eve of a high tide.

The total number of handicraft workers in North Vietnam is nearly 500,000, occupying a very important position in the national economy. Handicraft products not only supply most of the daily necessities of the people of North Vietnam, but also occupy an important position in the country's foreign trade. In 1959, the export of handicraft products will account for 24.3% of the total exports of North Vietnam. The Fourteenth (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party held last year pointed out that it is necessary to complete the cooperativization of handicrafts in North Vietnam in the next two years.

### 越南加速社会主义改造  河内掀起对私营工商业改造高潮  手工业合作化将在两年以内完成

    越南加速社会主义改造
    河内掀起对私营工商业改造高潮
    手工业合作化将在两年以内完成
    本报讯　河内消息：越南民主共和国在大力发展农业合作化运动的同时，正在积极展开对私营工商业和手工业的社会主义改造工作。
    对私营工商业的社会主义改造，首先在共和国首都大规模进行。河内市正在带头掀起一个高潮，要在今年年底以前，把全市90％的私营工商业和75％的私营服务性行业实行公私合营。在手工业方面，据越南民主共和国商业部的统计，到今年5月下旬，越南北方的手工业者已有46％参加了各种合作组织。按照越南民主共和国的国家计划，到今年年底，参加合作组织的手工业者将占越南北方全体手工业者的80％，其中50％将参加手工业合作社。
    私营工商业和手工业在越南北方的国民经济中所占的比重很大。1958年底，私营资本主义工商业和手工业产品的产值，占越南北方的工业总产值的64.1％，而手工业产品的产值，也达到工业总产值的一半以上。商业方面，去年，私营商业的零售额占北方商业零售总额的45.5％。因此，加速对它们进行社会主义改造，对实现越南北方当前的社会主义革命任务，具有很重要的意义。
    越南政府为了实现对私营工商业的改造，一方面大力推广加工、订货、经销、代销等形式，一方面着手进行公私合营的试点工作。今年头四个月已有碗窑、榨松油坊、针织厂、机器厂、砖窑、锯木厂、制革厂、印刷厂等十八个企业单位公私合营；目前，公私合营工作正在扩大试点面。在河内已有五金、锯木、机器制砖瓦、化工、印刷、电影、纺织和布鞋等八个行业的五十八个工业企业着手进行公私合营。
    今年5月间，越南劳动党发表中央委员会第十六次（扩大）会议公报，对过去改造资本主义经济的成绩作了估价。会议认为：自从和平恢复以来，由于党和政府的教育和帮助，越南北方的资产阶级分子已经在不同程度上接受社会主义改造和有了许多进步。并在恢复和初步发展国民经济的事业中作出了一定的贡献。在最近几年来，私营资本主义工商业在低级和中级的国家资本主义的形式下，获得了初步的改造，因此，资本主义工商业的消极和落后面受到了限制，有利于国计民生的积极面获得了发扬。另方面，国营经济和合作经济成分的日益发展，已经为资本主义工商业的社会主义改造创造了有利的条件。
    会议提出了大力实现对资本主义工商业社会主义改造政策的任务。并指出，对于资产阶级分子，应当在祖国战线内加强对他们的团结和教育，在改造资本主义企业的同时，应当对资产阶级分子的生活和工作给以适当的安排，使用他们的技术和管理企业的经验，使他们有条件改造成为服务于祖国、服务于人民的劳动者。
    目前，河内的许多私营工商业者正纷纷向政府提出申请，要求立即批准他们公私合营，出现了高潮前夕的可喜的气氛。
    越南北方手工业者的总数近五十万，在国民经济中占很重要的地位。手工业产品不仅供应了越南北方人民的大部分日用必需品，而且在国家对外贸易工作中也据有重要地位。1959年，手工业品的出口，将占越南北方出口总额的24.3％。越南劳动党中央委员会去年召开的第十四次（扩大）会议曾指出，有必要在未来两年完成越南北方手工业合作化。
