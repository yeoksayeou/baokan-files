The teachers and students of the Biology Department of Nanjing Normal College, under the leadership of the department's Party General Branch, have clarified the purpose of teaching. Now a new style of "teachers teaching tirelessly" and students "learning without being weary" has been formed.

Since the beginning of this semester, the teachers have launched a discussion on "teaching for whom," realizing the serious political significance of doing a good job in current teaching work for the intellectualization of workers and peasants and accelerating socialist construction. Many teachers have linked doing a good job in teaching with their own ideological remolding, feeling that the direction is clear and that they have a goal. On this ideological basis, all the teachers in the department have launched a "five conscientiousness" upsurge in teaching: conscientious preparation, conscientious teaching, conscientious grading of homework, conscientious tutoring, and conscientious examination.

The teachers realize that to do a good job in teaching, it is necessary to prepare lessons well. Some veteran teachers, who had been teaching for decades, used to think that they were familiar with the teaching materials and had rich experience, so it was enough to spend one or two hours preparing for two or three hours of lectures. Now, they have all put forward clear requirements for themselves: the teaching materials must have ideological and scientific content, and full attention must be paid to reflecting the latest achievements in biological science in the teaching materials. Zang Mu, an assistant teacher in the Botany Teaching and Research Group, consulted relevant Chinese and foreign materials on cotton during lesson preparation, visited agricultural science research institutions and agricultural colleges in the Nanjing area, visited and inspected cotton high-yield fields in the suburbs, and even wrote letters to cotton experts in Anyang County, Henan, to ask for advice. In addition to preparing lessons on their own, teachers also conduct collective lesson preparation in teaching and research groups to study and determine the key points of lectures and teaching methods.

Teachers not only care about each other and learn from each other in lesson preparation, but also in classroom teaching. They listen to each other's lectures and conduct teaching discussions. Many young teachers try their best to turn the advantages of the old teachers' lectures into their own advantages, and sincerely put forward opinions on the shortcomings. Many old teachers, while helping young teachers improve classroom teaching, also humbly learn from the advantages of young teachers and improve their own classroom teaching. Professor Chen Xinguo and Associate Professor Xu Xiangsheng, who have been teaching for decades, feel that their classroom teaching still needs to be improved, and listening to young teachers' lectures has given them a lot of inspiration. In improving classroom teaching, teachers have listened to and studied the opinions put forward by students.

In order to better help students solve their learning difficulties, teachers conduct well-prepared tutoring activities based on in-depth understanding of students' learning. Associate Professor You Dashou and other teachers went to the students to check the teaching of zoology, and found that the lecture notes they compiled were too difficult and the pace of classroom teaching was too fast, which caused difficulties for students in learning. In response to these problems, he repeatedly researched and improved it himself, and analyzed it in the teaching and research group. After full preparation, he gave the students a tutoring session. The students expressed their satisfaction. Through this tutoring, You Dashou deeply felt that only by frequently understanding students' learning situation and managing both teaching and learning can the quality of teaching be continuously improved.

Teachers are also very serious about grading students' classroom assignments and conducting performance assessments. For students' homework, they not only carefully grade each copy, but also further clarify some common problems found in the homework to students in the classroom or during extracurricular tutoring.

Just like teachers clarified for whom to teach, students, after discussing "learning for whom," further clarified the purpose of learning. They fully demonstrated their initiative in learning, put forward the slogan of "five hearts": good preview, good listening, good self-study, good completion of homework, and good examination, and earnestly realized their requirements.

Since the beginning of this semester, the students have done their best to preview before class. In the classroom, the students combine listening, recording, reading, and thinking to actively accept knowledge. Some students, who in the past did not have a clear purpose of learning and did not preview, ended up with a mess in their minds after a class. Now that they have clarified the purpose of learning, not only are the notes recorded in an orderly and focused manner, but most of what they learn in class can be consolidated on the spot.

After-class review is an important part of systematizing knowledge and firmly mastering knowledge. Students not only carefully review lecture notes, take the initiative to ask teachers for tutoring, and plan to read reference books, but also hold reading report meetings.

Students also attach great importance to homework and examinations. They realize that doing homework is not only a means of deeply understanding coursework, but also can cultivate the ability to connect with reality and apply knowledge.

In addition to studying hard on their own, the students also enthusiastically and sincerely help teachers improve the quality of teaching. Class cadres and class representatives often understand and reflect students' opinions and requirements. Some classes have also set up teaching suggestion books and teaching suggestion boxes in dormitories to enthusiastically help teachers overcome the shortcomings in teaching. This makes teachers feel that students are both strict and sincere and kind to them. Teacher Gu Zhonghua said: "I have been teaching for decades, and I have never seen such a close teacher-student relationship."

### 教师循循善诱　学生孜孜攻读  南京师范学院生物系出现教学新风气

    教师循循善诱　学生孜孜攻读
    南京师范学院生物系出现教学新风气
    本报讯　南京师范学院生物系师生，在系的党总支领导下，明确了教学的目的性。现在已经形成教师“诲人不倦”、学生“学而不厌”的新风气。
    本学期以来，教师中展开了“为谁教学”的讨论，认识到搞好当前教学工作，对工农群众知识化，加速社会主义建设的严重政治意义。许多教师把做好教学工作，和自己的思想改造联系起来，觉得方向明确了，感到有了奔头。在这个思想基础上，全系教师掀起了一个备课好、上课好、批改作业好、辅导好、考查考试好的教学“五认真”的热潮。
    教师们认识到，搞好教学，首先要备好课。教了几十年书的老教师，过去认为自己教材熟悉，经验丰富，上两三小时课，花上一两小时备课就够了；现在他们都对自己提出了明确的要求：教材要有思想性、科学性，并充分注意把生物科学上新的成就反映到教材中来。植物教研组助教臧穆，在备课时博览了中外有关棉花的资料，走遍了南京地区农业科学研究机关和农业院校，访问和考察了市郊棉花丰产田，还专门写信到河南安阳县向棉花专家请教。教师们在各人自己备课的基础上，还在教研组里进行集体备课，研究确定讲授重点和教学方法。
    教师不仅在备课中，而且在课堂教学上也彼此关心、相互学习，他们相互听课，开展教学讨论。许多青年教师尽量把老教师的讲课优点变成自己的优点，对缺点也诚恳地提出意见。许多老教师在帮助青年教师提高课堂教学的同时，也虚心地学习青年教师的优点，改进自己的课堂教学。教了几十年书的陈新国教授、徐祥生副教授，都感到自己的课堂教学还须改进，听青年教师课对自己有不少启发。在改进课堂教学上，教师们更多地听取与研究了学生们提出的意见。
    为了更好地帮助学生解决学习上的困难，教师们在深入了解学生学习的基础上，进行有准备的辅导活动。尤大寿副教授和其它教师，分头到学生中去检查动物学教学情况，发现自己编的讲义较深，课堂讲授进度太快，造成了学生学习上的困难。针对这些问题，他自己反复作了几次研究和改进，并在教研组内做了分析，经过充分准备，然后给学生作了一次辅导。学生们表示满意。通过这次辅导，尤大寿深深地感到，只有经常了解学生学习情况，做到管教又管学，才能不断提高教学质量。
    教师对批改学生的课堂作业和执行成绩考查，也都非常认真。对学生的作业，他们不但逐本地细致批改，而且从作业中发现的一些共同问题，还在课堂上或课外辅导时向学生进一步讲清楚。
    像教师明确为谁教一样，学生经过“为谁而学”的讨论，进一步明确了学习的目的性。他们在学习中充分地发挥主动性，提出了预习好、听课好、自修好、完成作业好、考试考查好的“五用心”的口号，并认真实现自己提出的要求。
    本学期来，同学们都做到了课前预习；在课堂上，同学们把听、记、看、想结合起来，主动地接受知识。有的学生，过去由于学习目的不明确，也不预习，因而一堂课听下来，脑子里还是一笔糊涂账。现在他们明确了学习的目的性以后，不但笔记记得有条有理、有重点，而且课堂学到的东西，当堂大部分就能巩固。
    课后复习是使知识系统化与牢固地掌握知识的重要一环。同学们不但认真复习讲义、笔记，主动地请教师辅导，并有计划地阅读参考书，举行读书报告会。
    同学们也非常重视作业与考试考查。他们认识到做作业，不仅是深入理解课业的手段，而且可以培养联系实际、运用知识的能力。
    同学们除了自己用心学习外，还热心诚恳地帮助教师提高教学质量。各班干部和课代表，经常了解反映同学的意见和要求，有些班级还在宿舍里设了教学意见簿与教学意见箱，热情地帮助老师克服教学中存在的缺点，这使教师们感到学生对自己既要求严格，也诚恳亲切。教师顾钟骅说：“教了几十年书，从来没有看到这样亲密的师生关系。”
