Editor's Note:

	Extraordinary from the Ordinary

	This article introduces three ordinary Communist Party members from the People's Liberation Army. In their ordinary positions, they have dedicated themselves to their work day after day, year after year. Their common characteristics are diligence, selflessness, not shying away from dirt, not fearing hardship, and creating extraordinary achievements in their respective positions, setting a brilliant example for the people.

	Why are they able to do this? Comrade Wu Kun put it well: "We are doing revolution!" Doing revolution allows one to "give up being a platoon leader and go scrub pots." Doing revolution allows one to dedicate oneself to the sick and wounded for life, becoming their good nanny. Doing revolution allows one to be a gunner, cook, raise pigs, repair shoes, cut hair, mend clothes, and do everything. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, for the sake of the revolution, they can disregard fame and status, not care about rewards, not set any conditions, and not covet any enjoyment, burying themselves in hard work and cherishing public property. For the sake of the revolution, they can shoulder these ordinary yet arduous tasks, being selfless and devoted to public service, overcoming difficulties and exhausting their efforts day after day, year after year, working diligently and bearing hardships without complaint.

	Originally, a revolutionary, a communist fighter, in order to realize the lofty ideal of communism, can self-sacrificingly dedicate his life to the communist cause. They can have no personal selfish thoughts, be fearless in the face of danger; they can resolutely obey the interests of the country and the collective, as well as the work needs of the Party and the country, demonstrating the finest and noblest moral qualities of mankind. The three Communist Party members introduced here are precisely figures who have carried forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle and self-sacrifice of millions of revolutionaries and Communist Party members. These virtues of Communist Party members that they have demonstrated will forever be praised and learned by the people.

    平凡出非凡
    这里介绍了人民子弟兵中的三个平凡的共产党员。他们在平凡的岗位上，数年如一日地献身于他们所担负的工作。他们共同的特点是，勤勤恳恳，舍己为人，不嫌脏，不怕累，在自己的岗位上，做出了非凡的事迹，为人们树立了光辉的榜样。
    他们为什么能够这样呢？吴坤同志说得好：“干革命嘛！”干革命，就可以“放着排长不干，去刷锅”。干革命，就可以终生献给伤病人，做他们的好保姆。干革命，就可以当炮手，烧饭，养猪，补鞋，理发，补衣服，什么都去干。他们在党的教育和培养下，为了革命，可以不计较名誉地位，不计较报酬，不讲什么条件，不贪图任何享受，埋头苦干，爱护公物。为了革命，可以担负这些平凡而又艰苦的工作，克己奉公，数年如一日地冲破困难，竭尽心力，任劳任怨。
    本来，一个革命者、一个共产主义战士，为了实现共产主义的崇高理想，可以自我牺牲地终生献身于共产主义事业。他们可以没有个人私念，临危不惧；可以坚决服从国家的和集体的利益，以及党和国家的工作需要，表现出人类的最优良高尚的道德品质。这里介绍的三个共产党员，正是发扬了千百万革命者、共产党员艰苦奋斗、自我牺牲光荣传统的人物。他们所表现的这些共产党员的美德，将永远为人们所传诵和学习。
