    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 25th: The "Organization of American States" Council held a meeting on the 24th, deciding to hold a Pan-American Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Santiago, Chile, on August 12th to discuss the situation in the Caribbean.

    The United States announced that Secretary of State Herter would attend the meeting unless absolutely necessary.

    Latin American public opinion points out that the reason the United States is so keen on convening this meeting is to create conditions for openly interfering in Cuba under the guise of "opposing communism."

    Reports indicate that Cuba, Venezuela, and other Latin American countries will suggest discussing issues that the United States dislikes at this meeting. At the "Organization of American States" Council meeting on the 24th, the Venezuelan representative formally requested the Council to include a proposal on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting—to establish a supervisory committee to ensure the realization of the principles of establishing representative governments and protecting human rights in the Americas. Cuban President Dorticós said in a recent speech that Cuba intends to raise the issue of human rights violations by the dictatorial regimes of the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua at this Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Some time ago, Prime Minister Castro stated that issues such as the summoning of Cuban traitors like Díaz Lanz to the United States Senate to "testify" and other interferences in other countries' internal affairs should be brought up for discussion in the "Organization of American States."

    美国热中召开泛美外长会议  妄图制造条件公开干涉古巴
    据新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：“美洲国家组织”理事会24日举行会议，决定于8月12日在智利首都圣地亚哥举行泛美外长会议来讨论加勒比海的局势。
    美国方面宣布，除非万不得已，国务卿赫脱将参加这次会议。
    拉丁美洲舆论指出，美国所以热中于召开这次会议，其目的是在“反对共产主义”的幌子下为公开干涉古巴制造条件。
    消息显示，古巴和委内瑞拉等拉丁美洲国家将在这次会议上建议讨论美国所不喜欢的问题。在24日的“美洲国家组织”理事会的会议上，委内瑞拉代表正式要求理事会在外长会议的议程上列入这项建议——设立一个监督委员会来保证实现美洲各国成立代议制政体和保障人权的原则，古巴总统多尔蒂科斯在最近一次谈话中说，古巴打算在这次外长会议上提出多米尼加和尼加拉瓜独裁政权侵犯人权的问题。前些时候，卡斯特罗总理曾表示：类似古巴卖国贼迪亚斯·兰斯被召到美国参议院“作证”等干涉他国内政的问题应该提到“美洲国家组织”去讨论。
