Those Who Do Leadership Work Should Read More

Learning is for the purpose of doing a good job. To do a good job, learning is indispensable. There are many aspects to learning. Planting experimental plots and holding on-site meetings are learning. Reading the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Comrade Mao Zedong, studying the Party's policies and documents, and reading newspapers and magazines are all learning.

Planting experimental plots is learning direct experience, and reading books is learning indirect experience. Learning direct experience is very important, and learning indirect experience from books is equally important. Generally speaking, comrades who do leadership work pay more attention to learning from current production and work experiences, and their practical experience is also relatively rich. However, some people read less of the works of Marx and Lenin because they are busy. Therefore, comrades who do leadership work should read more books, improve their level of Marxism-Leninism, and elevate their practical work experience to the theoretical level, so as to guide future work more effectively. Chairman Mao said long ago: "Those with work experience should study theory, read books seriously, and then their experience can be given theoretical and comprehensive qualities and raised to the level of theory. Only then can they avoid mistaking partial experience for universal truth and avoid committing empiricist errors." ("Rectify the Party's Style of Work")

Reading requires time, and comrades who do leadership work are especially busy. Agricultural production needs to be grasped, industrial production needs to be grasped, commerce needs to be grasped, transportation needs to be grasped, and the lives of the masses need to be arranged. During the day, they run to several production teams, and meetings at night can go on until late. They are very busy, but after all the busyness, there are still many problems in their work that they cannot figure out or handle well. In fact, these problems have been clearly explained in principle in the works of Marx and Lenin, and have long been clearly stipulated in the Party's policy documents. Because they have not read them carefully, their work inevitably takes detours. Many comrades have now realized that they have suffered losses because they did not pay attention to reading, and have begun to be interested in reading. Some comrades have not realized this. They emphasize that they are busy at work and have no time to read. Because they do not read, their level cannot be improved, and their work becomes even more busy and chaotic, forming a vicious cycle. How to break this cycle? Only by steeling oneself to squeeze out some time and start with reading. Only in this way can we gradually break away from the circle of事務主義 and develop a good habit of combining reading, heart-to-heart talks, and thinking about problems.

Because Marxism-Leninism is our weapon for overcoming all enemies and doing all work well, in the past, in a tense war environment, many comrades squeezed out time to read during breaks in battles and marches; comrades who did underground work in the White areas risked imprisonment and even death to find "forbidden books" to read by all means. Today, we read without the risk of imprisonment or execution. Comparing the past and the present, what other difficulties can we mention?

Marxism-Leninism is not unattainable. Comrades who do leadership work have practical experience, which is the most favorable condition for learning theory. The more practical work experience, the stronger the ability to understand theory. Many comrades will have such an experience: some problems in books can only be better understood after practice. For example, the book "Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin on Communist Society" was not as deeply understood last year as it is this year, because we now have the practical experience of 1958. For example, Comrade Mao Zedong's writings on the mass line and seeking truth from facts have been read in the past, but reading them again today is like reading something new, also because we have new practical experience from 1958. Therefore, we must read the works of Marxism-Leninism tirelessly, read and do, do and read, read and do in comparison. Only in this way can we get something out of reading.

"Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." The level of theory of a commune leader is related to the production, life, and revolutionary movement of tens of thousands of people, and the level of theory of a county leader is even more important. The higher the leadership position, the greater the relationship. It can be seen that it is an urgent requirement of the Party and the people's revolutionary cause for comrades who do leadership work to strive to improve their level of Marxism-Leninism. We must regard reading as a part of our revolutionary work, as an indispensable part of our lives. Every leading cadre should "take the lead in reading" as they "take the lead in doing" in their work, and cultivate a habit of reading in the whole Party and among all cadres in Hubei Province.

### 做领导工作的人更应当读书

专栏：

    做领导工作的人更应当读书
    学习的目的是为了搞好工作。要搞好工作，就离不开学习。学习的方面很广，种试验田、开现场会是学习，阅读马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东同志的著作，钻研党的政策、文件，看报纸、看杂志，都是学习。
    种试验田是学习直接的经验，读书是学习间接的经验，学习直接的经验很重要，学习书本上的间接经验同样很重要。作领导工作的同志，一般地说，总是比较注意学习当前生产和工作中的经验的，自己的实践经验也比较丰富。但是，有人因为忙，读马克思列宁主义的著作就比较少了。因此，作领导工作的同志就更应当多读点书，提高自己的马克思列宁主义水平，把实际工作经验总结提高到理论上来，更有力地指导今后的工作。毛主席早就说过：“有工作经验的人，要向理论方面学习，要认真读
  书，然后才可以使经验带上理论性，综合性，上升成为理论，然后才可以不把局部经验误认为是普遍真理，才可以不犯经验主义的错误。”（“整顿党的作风”）
    读书是需要时间的，作领导工作的同志又特别忙，农业生产要抓，工业生产也要抓，商业要抓，交通运输也要抓，还要安排群众生活，白天跑几个生产队，晚上开会还要搞到深更半夜。忙是忙得很，可是忙来忙去，工作中还有很多问题弄不清楚，处理不好。其实，这些问题，在马克思列宁主义的著作中，已经把原理说得清清楚楚了，在党的政策文件里早已规定得明明白白了。由于没有认真阅读，工作就难免走弯路。现在不少同志已经发觉因为没有注意读书，吃了亏，开始对读书有了兴趣。有的同志没有体会到这一点。他们强调工作忙，没有时间读书。因为不读书，水平提不高，工作更加忙忙碌碌，形成一个循环。怎样打破这一个循环？只有狠狠心挤点时间出来，从读书下手。只有这样，才能逐步从事务主义的圈子里摆脱出来，养成一个读书、谈心、想问题相结合的好习惯。
    正因为马克思列宁主义是我们战胜一切敌人、搞好一切工作的武器，过去，在紧张的战争环境中，不少同志在战斗和行军的间隙中挤出时间来读书；在白区作地下工作的同志冒着坐牢、甚至牺牲生命的危险，千方百计地寻找“禁书”来阅读。我们今天读书，一没有坐牢的危险，二没有杀头的危险，今昔对比，还有什么困难能说得出口呢？
    马克思列宁主义并不是高不可攀的，作领导工作的同志有实践经验，这就是学习理论最有利的条件，实际工作经验愈多，理解理论的能力就愈强。许多同志都会有这样的体会：书上讲的有些问题，要经过实践才能更好的理解。比如，“马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林论共产主义社会”这一本书，去年读就没有今年读理解的深刻，原因就是我们现在有1958年的实践经验了。又如毛泽东同志论述群众路线和实事求是的著作，过去都读过，但是今天再读，好像还是新的一样，原因也是我们有了1958年的新的实践经验了。因此，我们对马克思列宁主义的著作要不厌其烦的读，读了又做，做了又读，边读边做，读做对照，这样读书才能读出名堂来。
      “没有革命的理论，就没有革命的运动”。一个公社领导者的理论水平的高低关系着几万群众的生产、生活和革命运动的开展，一个县的领导者的理论水平的高低关系更大。领导岗位越高，关系也就越大。可见作领导工作的同志努力提高自己的马克思列宁主义水平，是党和人民革命事业的迫切要求。我们必须把读书当成我们的革命工作的一部分，当成我们生活中不可缺少的东西。每一个领导干部都应当像在工作上“带头干”一样地“带头读书”，在湖北省全党和全体干部中养成读书的风气。
