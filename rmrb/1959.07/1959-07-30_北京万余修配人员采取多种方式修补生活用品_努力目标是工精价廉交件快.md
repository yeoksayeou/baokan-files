(Our report) Beijing's industrial, handicraft, commercial, and neighborhood departments are working together to vigorously develop repair services for people's daily necessities. According to incomplete statistics, the city now has more than 3,000 repair service points and more than 15,000 repair personnel. The scope of repairs covers all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, from darning precious furs to sewing buttons, totaling more than 700 types of services. The 25 repair points on Wangfujing Street repaired more than 19,000 old and damaged items in half a month.

The departments have adopted four types of repair service formats based on different commodities: First, industrial and commercial departments have established specialized repair outlets to repair complex items such as musical instruments, instruments, and radios. Second, fixed-point stalls or mobile repairs are mainly for repairing leather shoes, washbasins, patching pots, and sharpening scissors. Third, neighborhood departments have established comprehensive repair service stations in streets and alleys, organizing family repair groups to collect work centrally and repair it separately, serving nearby residents. Fourth, stores operate as both shops and repair departments, with salespersons also serving as repair personnel, performing simple repairs such as repairing pens, flashlights, and zippers on leather bags, which can generally be completed on the spot. Service methods include: fixed locations, long-term service; telephone contact, door-to-door service; scheduled times and locations, service in hutongs; and roving service in streets and alleys.

How to ensure that repair work is of excellent quality, reasonably priced, and quickly completed? The Beijing repair industry is paying attention to solving this problem. Many repair industry workers are actively learning professional skills and establishing quality inspection systems to ensure the quality of repairs. After the Xicheng Clock and Watch Repair Cooperative established a quality inspection system, the rate of return repairs for clocks and watches dropped rapidly, and repair efficiency also doubled. When repairing a highly precise theodolite, the repair personnel at the repair outlet of the Beijing Public-Private Joint Optical Instrument Factory adopted a joint "consultation" method from disassembling the instrument to repairing and correcting the angles, ensuring quality. Workers have also created and improved some tools and equipment to shorten repair time. Now, many repair departments can repair items with minor "problems" as soon as they arrive.

### 北京万余修配人员采取多种方式修补生活用品  努力目标是工精价廉交件快

    北京万余修配人员采取多种方式修补生活用品
    努力目标是工精价廉交件快
    本报讯　北京工业、手工业、商业和街道部门四管齐下，大力开展人民日常生活用品的修补业务。据不完全统计，目前全市修配服务点已经增加到三千多个，修理人员有一万五千多人。修配范围包括衣、食、住、行各个方面，细至织补珍贵皮毛，粗至钉钮扣，共七百多种。王府井大街的二十五个修理点，在半个月内就修好了一万九千多件残旧的物品。
    几个部门根据不同商品采取了四种修配服务形式。一、工业和商业部门设立专业修理门市部，修理构造复杂的物品，如乐器、仪器、收音机等。二、定点设摊或流动修理。主要是修理皮鞋、面盆、补锅子、磨剪刀等。三、街道部门在街头巷尾设立综合修理服务站，组织家庭修理小组，集中收活，分散修理，为附近居民服务。四、商店兼修理部，售货员兼修配员，进行简单的修配工作，如修钢笔、手电筒、皮包拉锁等，一般可以当时交货。服务方法有以下几种：固定地点，长驻服务；电话联系，上门服务；定时定点，下胡同服务；串街走巷，流动服务，等等。
    怎样使修理业务做到工精价廉，并且能尽快修好？北京修理行业已在注意解决这一问题。许多修理行业的职工积极学习业务技术，建立质量验收等制度，保证修理质量。西城钟表修理社建立质量验收制度后，钟表返修率迅速下降，修理效率也提高了两倍。北京市公私合营光学仪器厂修理门市部在修理一架精密度很高的经纬仪时，从拆卸仪器，到修成、矫正角度，修理人员都采取共同“会诊”的办法，保证了质量。职工们还创造和改进了一些工具设备，来缩短修理时间。现在，许多修理部门对一些“毛病”不大的东西，做到了随到随修。
