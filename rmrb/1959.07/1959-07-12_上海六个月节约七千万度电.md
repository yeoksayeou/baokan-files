Shanghai Saves 70 Million Kilowatt-Hours of Electricity in Six Months

    (Our report) From January to the end of June this year, Shanghai region saved nearly 70 million kilowatt-hours of electricity for the country by extensively carrying out electricity conservation. Various factories also cooperated with the power departments to further improve the adjustment of power load, reducing the peak load of the power grid by 11,000 kilowatts. The electricity saved from these two aspects is equivalent to adding a 25,000 kilowatt power plant for the country.

    This region started the work of saving electricity and adjusting power load as early as 1952, and has achieved great results every year. This year, in order to ensure greater needs for industrial production electricity, under the leadership of the Power Industry Party Committee, the Shanghai Electric Power Administration Bureau and the Shanghai Power Supply Company held several professional meetings with the heads of various industrial authorities and large factory power departments in the city to study how to strengthen electricity management, reduce the electricity consumption per unit product, and strengthen load adjustment. These meetings greatly promoted the electricity conservation and power load adjustment work of various factories and enterprises.

    The in-depth development of the production increase and economy practice movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution has played a huge role in promoting electricity conservation in the Shanghai region. The Municipal Textile Industry Bureau and the Metallurgical Industry Bureau have successively organized their affiliated factories to exchange experiences in electricity conservation, and determined the annual electricity conservation targets, launching business-related electricity conservation competitions. Some departments, such as the Grain and Oil Company, have also included electricity conservation as one of the contents of the red flag competition evaluation. Many factories have tried every means to tap the potential for electricity conservation while increasing production. For example, in the electric furnace steelmaking of Shanghai Machine Repair General Factory, the electricity consumption per ton was 577 kilowatt-hours last year. This year, due to the adoption of oxygen blowing, hot charging and other measures, the electricity consumption per ton of steel was reduced by 40 kilowatt-hours compared with the past. The China Gas Refining Plant has further mastered the equipment performance by strengthening technical management, so that the electricity consumption per ton of calcium carbide has dropped from an average of 4,525 kilowatt-hours last year to 3,250 kilowatt-hours. Huafeng Fuxin Flour Mill adjusted the ratio of grinding screens, accelerated the speed of steel mills, rebuilt the fast bran beater, and further improved the flour path, so that the electricity consumption per ton of flour dropped from an average of 46.5 kilowatt-hours last year to 36.4 kilowatt-hours.

    Recently, due to the further organizational promotion by various industrial authorities, the electricity conservation work in this region has undergone new developments. For example, the Shanghai Ferroalloy Plant consumed about 5,200 kilowatt-hours of electricity per ton of ferrosilicon in the first quarter. In May, through the red flag competition and the implementation of a series of technical measures, the electricity consumption per ton of ferrosilicon in the No. 2 electric furnace dropped to 4,370 kilowatt-hours, lower than the national inter-factory competition target of 4,500 kilowatt-hours. Many factories have also saved a lot of electricity by strengthening the maintenance of machines.

    Due to the emphasis of the leaders of various units, the adjustment of power load in Shanghai region has also been carried out relatively smoothly. All factory workers have established the idea of ​​a chess game, starting from the overall situation, avoiding using electricity during peak power consumption, and giving electricity to key enterprises. The cotton mills in Shanghai have fully developed the communist style, making detailed arrangements for the start-up shifts, so that they eat and rest during the peak power consumption time, so that the electricity consumption at night can be fully guaranteed. The Shanghai Machine Tool Forging Iron Factory, which produces in two shifts, originally only opened early and middle shifts every day, and used electricity during the three peak load times of the power grid. After organization and arrangement, it quickly changed the middle shift to the night shift. Thanks to the joint efforts of large, medium and small factories, the peak load has been eased.

    Currently, various factories in Shanghai are further carrying out electricity conservation work in conjunction with the production increase and economy practice movement. (Attached picture)

### 上海六个月节约七千万度电

    上海六个月节约七千万度电
    本报讯　上海地区从今年1月到6月底，由于广泛开展了节约用电，为国家节约了近七千万度电。各工厂又配合电业部门进一步搞好调整电力负荷工作，压低了电力网的高峰负荷一万一千瓩。这两方面节约的电力，等于为国家增加一座二万五千瓩的发电厂。
    这个地区远在1952年就开始了节约用电及调整电力负荷工作，每年都取得很大成绩。今年，为了保证工业生产用电的更大需要，在电业党委领导下，上海电业管理局及上海供电公司曾经与全市各工业主管单位和大工厂动力部门负责人，几次召开专业会议，研究如何加强用电管理，降低产品单位耗电量和加强调整负荷工作，通过这些会议，大大促进了各工厂企业的节约用电和调整电力负荷工作。
    以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动的深入开展，对上海地区节约用电工作又起了巨大的推动作用。市纺织工业局和冶金工业局曾先后组织所属各厂交流节约用电经验，并确定了全年节约用电指标，开展了同业务节约用电竞赛。有些部门如粮食油脂公司等，还把节约用电列为红旗竞赛评比内容之一。不少工厂在提高生产的同时，千方百计地挖掘节约用电潜力。如上海机修总厂的电炉炼钢，去年每吨用电五百七十七度，今年由于采用了吹氧、热加料等措施，每吨钢耗电量就比过去降低了四十度。中国炼气厂通过加强技术管理，进一步掌握设备性能，使每吨电石耗电量从去年平均四千五百二十五度下降到三千二百五十度。华丰福新面粉厂调整磨筛比例、加快钢磨转速、改建快速打麸机和进一步改善粉路等，使每吨面粉耗电量从去年平均四十六点五度降到三十六点四度。
    最近由于各工业主管单位进一步的组织推动，这个地区的节约用电工作又有了新的发展。如上海铁合金厂在第一季度每吨矽铁耗电量是五千二百度左右。5月份通过红旗竞赛，贯彻了一系列技术措施，二号电炉每吨矽铁耗电量就降到四千三百七十度，低于全国厂际竞赛四千五百度的指标。许多工厂由于加强了机器的检修，也节约了不少电力。
    由于各单位领导重视，上海地区的调整电力负荷工作也进行得比较顺利。各厂职工都树立了一盘棋思想，从整体出发，避开在电力紧张时间用电，将电让给重点企业使用。上海的棉纺厂充分发扬了共产主义风格，将开工班次进行细致的安排，做到都在电力高峰时间吃饭和休息，使晚上用电得到充分保证。二班制生产的上海机床锻铁厂原来每日只开早、中班，在电力网的三个高峰负荷时间都在用电，经过组织和安排，很快就将中班改为夜班。由于大、中、小工厂共同努力，缓和了高峰负荷。
    目前上海各工厂正结合增产节约运动，进一步开展节约用电工作。（附图片）
