    The Qilian Mountains now boast a comprehensive highway network, significantly altering the previously isolated state of transportation. Currently, highways connect counties within the mountainous region, as well as different communes; urban and rural roads suitable for large vehicles, pack animal trails, and numerous field paths have also undergone repairs.
    The Qilian Mountains, known as "China's Urals," feature overlapping mountains and rugged terrain, and before liberation, were sparsely populated. Since liberation, in order to explore and develop the underground resources here, thousands of geological exploration personnel and scientists have continuously advanced into the Qilian Mountains. With the development of geological exploration, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Transportation and the People's Committee of Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture dispatched a large number of cadres to form survey teams that trekked across the Qilian Mountains to survey highway routes. Over the past few years, with the support of people of all ethnic groups in the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, more than 1,500 kilometers of newly built, rebuilt, and currently being repaired roads have been completed in the mountainous area. The treacherous mountain roads of the past have now been transformed into smooth avenues.
    The smooth flow of traffic in the mountainous area not only facilitates the exploration and development of mineral resources, but also opens up sales channels for the area's rich local specialties, and strengthens the connection between Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the outside world.

    祁连山区的公路网
    祁连山区出现四通八达的公路网，交通闭塞的面貌有了很大改变。现在，山区县与县，社与社之间都有公路相连；城乡大车道、驮运道和许多田间道路也都经过了整修。
    号称“中国的乌拉尔”的祁连山区，山峦重叠，地形险峻，解放前是一块人迹罕到的地区。解放以来，为了勘查和开发这里的地下宝藏，数以千计的地质勘探人员和科学家，接连不断地向祁连山进发。随着地质勘探事业的发展，青海省交通厅和海北藏族自治州人民委员会抽调大批干部，组成踏勘组，翻山越岭地踏勘了祁连山区的公路线路。几年来在海北藏族自治州各族人民的支援下，山区新建、改建和正在整修的公路达一千五百多公里。长久以来的山区险路，现在变成了平坦大道。
    山区道路的畅通，不只便利了矿藏的勘探和开发，同时为山区丰富的土特产打开了销路，沟通了海北藏族自治州和外界的联系。
