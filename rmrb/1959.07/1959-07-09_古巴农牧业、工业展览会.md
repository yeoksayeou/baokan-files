    Cuban Agricultural, Livestock and Industrial Exhibition
    Kong Mai
    What kind of life are Cuban farmers living now? What kind of situation will emerge in the Cuban countryside after the implementation of land reform? What kind of work will the Cuban government do to develop agricultural production?… The Cuban Agricultural, Livestock and Industrial Exhibition being held in Havana answers these questions.
    This exhibition was organized by the student union of the College of Engineering, Agronomy and Sugar Industry of the University of Havana. This large-scale exhibition attracts tens of thousands of visitors every day.
    The exhibition uses concrete comparisons to illustrate what changes land reform will bring to the Cuban countryside. The first thing that catches the eye of visitors is a dilapidated thatched cottage inhabited by farmers. This is a picture of the impoverished lives of Cuban farmers under the cruel exploitation of imperialism and large landowners. In Cuba, 500,000 farmers have no land. They are cruelly exploited by large landowners and have to hand over a quarter, a third, or even half of their harvest to the landowners every year, while maintaining the lowest standard of living. Agricultural workers working on large plantations lead even more miserable lives, with only four months of work a year. This situation greatly hinders the development of agricultural productivity in Cuba.
    On the other side, there is a new, completely different picture of the countryside that will emerge in Cuba after land reform. This is a rural settlement with comfortable and hygienic housing, rural hospitals, department stores, clean schools, and wide roads. This picture was designed by the revolutionary army and more than 100 engineers after conducting a detailed survey in the countryside. The construction of this new countryside is currently underway in the Sierra Maestra mountains. Other parts of the exhibition show measures to increase agricultural and livestock production, including fertilization, soil improvement, seed selection, and water irrigation systems. The exhibition also explains to the audience how to rationally use each caballeria area of land after the implementation of land reform. In the past, the large plantation system greatly limited the productivity of the land. A chart points out that large plantations produce only 2,056 kilograms of rice per hectare and only 1,700 kilograms of corn. The average productivity of large plantations is only a quarter of that of small farmers. Many visitors enthusiastically watched a large model of the drainage and canalization of the Zapata Swamp in central Cuba. This project is currently underway, and when completed, it will increase the available land by 15,000 caballerias. The exhibition also showed documentary films that vividly contrasted the previous lives of farmers with the new lives they will soon achieve, illustrating that land reform is an urgent requirement of the vast number of farmers. The film also explains to the people how to organize cooperatives, how to change single production, and what measures to take to increase production.
    The agricultural machinery hall displayed tractors, improved farm tools, and automobiles. The exhibition also demonstrated the operation of these tools. Many revolutionary soldiers, workers, farmers, women, students, and children gathered around these machines to visit. They are obviously attracted by the beautiful prospects opened up by new agricultural tools for the development of Cuban agriculture after land reform.
    In the courtyard of the exhibition, many merchants and farmers are holding charity sales, and the proceeds will be donated for the expenses of land reform work.
    On the afternoon of the 5th, the Chinese journalists delegation, which was visiting Cuba, also came to visit the exhibition. Cuban friends enthusiastically asked these guests from the other side of the earth many questions about China's land reform. Yao Zhen, the head of the journalists delegation, told Cuban friends that since the implementation of land reform in the new China, agricultural production has increased significantly. Yao Zhen also congratulated the Cuban people on their achievements in land reform.

    古巴农牧业、工业展览会
    孔迈
    目前古巴农民在过着怎样的生活呢？实行土地改革以后古巴农村将出现什么样的局面呢？古巴政府为发展农业生产将做些什么工作呢？……正在哈瓦那举行的古巴农牧业、工业展览会回答了这些问题。
    这次展览会是哈瓦那大学工程、农艺和糖业学院学生会举办的。这个规模宏大的展览会，每天吸引着成千上万的观众。
    展览会用具体对比的办法，说明土地改革将给古巴农村带来什么变化。首先映入参观者的眼帘的是一所农民住的破破烂烂的茅屋。这是一幅在帝国主义和大庄园主残酷剥削下古巴农民穷困生活的图景。在古巴有五十万农民没有土地。他们受到大庄园主的残酷剥削，每年不得不把四分之一、三分之一、甚至一半的收成交给土地所有者，而维持着最低的生活水平。在大种植园工作的农业工人生活更要悲惨，他们在一年中只有四个月有工作。这种情况大大阻碍古巴的农业生产力的发展。
    在另一旁，是一幅新的、完全不同的，在古巴土地改革后将要出现的农村图景。这是一个农村的居民点，有舒服、卫生的住宅，有农村医院、百货商店和清洁的学校，还有宽广的公路等。这幅图景是革命军队和一百多名工程师在农村进行了详细的调查之后设计出来的。这种新农村的建设，目前正在马埃斯特腊山区全力进行。展览会其它部分显示了增加农牧业生产的措施，其中有施肥、改良土壤、选种、以及水利灌溉系统。展览会也向观众解释了在实行土地改革以后如何合理地利用每一卡瓦耶里亚面积的土地。在从前，大庄园制大大地限制了土地的生产率。一幅图表指出，大庄园每公顷的稻谷生产只有二千零五十六公斤，玉米产量只有一千七百公斤。大庄园的平均生产率只等于小农耕种土地的四分之一。许多参观者兴致勃勃地观看古巴中部萨巴塔沼泽地的排水和沟渠化的大模型。这一工程目前正在进行，工程完成后，将使可以利用的土地增加一万五千卡瓦耶里亚。在展览会上还放映了纪录影片，把农民以前的生活和他们不久就要取得的新生活作了鲜明的对比，说明进行土地改革是广大农民迫切的要求。电影还向人民解释如何组织合作社，如何改变单一生产以及采取那些增加生产的措施等。
    在农业机器馆里展出了拖拉机、改良农具和汽车。展览会上还表演了这些工具的操作。许多革命军战士、工人、农民、妇女、学生和儿童围着这些机器参观。他们显然为新式农具在土地改革后给古巴农业发展打开的美好前景吸引住了。
    在展览会的院子里，许多商人和农民正举行义卖，所得到的款项将捐出作为土地改革工作的费用。
    5日下午，正在古巴访问的中国新闻工作者代表团也来参观展览会。古巴朋友们很热情地向这些来自地球那一面的客人提出了许多关于中国土地改革的问题。新闻工作者代表团团长姚溱对古巴朋友们说，新中国自从实现了土地改革以后，农业生产就显著地提高了。姚溱还祝贺古巴人民在土地改革上取得成就。
