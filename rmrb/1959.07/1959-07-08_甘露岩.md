Ganlu Rock

Thirty miles southwest of Taining County, Fujian Province, the mountains are towering, the forests are lush, and the scenery is secluded. Here, a cliff face, as high as eighty meters, is recessed inward to a depth of about twenty meters, forming an open cliff cave, which is one of the famous scenic spots of Taining, "Ganlu Rock". Ganlu Rock is also called "Ganlu Nunnery" because it is occupied by a Buddhist temple.

The entire Ganlu Nunnery is built in the cliff cave. From a distance, the terraces and pavilions overlap, the eaves are stretched, and the corridors and railings are connected in a zigzag manner, like a fairy cave. How were these ingenious pavilions built? It turns out that most of the cliff caves have no flat ground. The construction workers looked along the cave and selected a few protruding cliff layers, slightly leveled them, and then supported the platform with wooden frames on the outside, and built the halls on it. Although these halls are single-story buildings, they look like pavilions from a distance. The various buildings are also connected by trestle roads erected along the cliff walls, surrounded by railings. It seems that the architects of that year used superb technology to make full use of a rugged cave where it was difficult to find a foothold, in a very natural way.

In 1958, the Nanping Special District of Fujian Province carried out a general survey of cultural relics and discovered that Ganlu Nunnery had many inscriptions and murals from the Song Dynasty. The Fujian Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee conducted a review based on the report from the Nanping Special District, and then confirmed that Ganlu Nunnery was built during the Shaoxing period in the early Southern Song Dynasty.

Ganlu Rock is an eastward-facing cliff cave, and the buildings are distributed as follows: the "Shen Pavilion" is in the lower part of the front (southwest), the "Upper Hall" is in the higher part, the south side is called Nan'an Pavilion, and the north side is called Guanyin Pavilion. There is also a small pavilion in front of the Shen Pavilion, a warehouse behind the Nan'an Pavilion, and a row of houses to the west of the Guanyin Pavilion, and a kitchen to the east of the pavilion. Except for the small pavilion, houses, and kitchen, which are still under research, the rest were built in the Song Dynasty. The light and stretched outer walls of the various buildings, and the mutually communicative coordination, achieved a high artistic effect. Originally, it is very difficult to find a Song Dynasty wooden structure building in southern China. Now, finding such a complete and exquisite group of buildings is an unprecedented new discovery in the field of ancient architecture in the whole country. (Attached picture)

    甘露岩
    福建省泰宁县西南三十里一带，山峦耸立，林木葱郁，风景清幽。这里有一块高达八十公尺的崖层向里凹进去约二十公尺深，形成了一个敞着口的崖洞，这就是泰宁名胜之一的“甘露岩”。甘露岩因有一所佛寺占据着，所以又叫“甘露庵”。
    甘露庵全部建筑在崖洞中，远远看去台阁重重，屋角舒展，走道栏杆曲折相连，真如神仙洞府。这些巧若天生的楼阁是怎样建成的呢？原来崖洞大都无一点平坦之地，建筑工人沿洞了望挑选到几处突出的崖层，稍加平整，在外侧再用木架支撑起台座，在上面盖起了殿堂。这些殿堂虽然是单层建筑，远望却像楼阁一样。各个建筑物之间也沿崖壁出入架起栈道，围着栏杆，以相连属。看来，当年的建筑师们，以高超的技术把一个崎岖不平、很难找到立足之地的山洞，利用得十分自然。
    1958年福建省南平专区进行文物普查工作时，发现了甘露庵有很多宋人的题记和壁画，福建省文物管理委员会根据南平专区的报告又进行了复查，于是才肯定了甘露庵是南宋初期绍兴年间所建。
    甘露岩是向东的崖洞，建筑是这样分布的：正面（西南）低处是“蜃阁”，高处是“上殿”，南面叫南安阁，北面叫观音阁。蜃阁前还有一个小亭子，南安阁后有一间仓库，观音阁西有一排住房、阁东是厨房。除了小亭子、住房和厨房尚待研究外，其余都是宋代所建的。各个建筑物轻盈舒展的外壁，和互相沟通的配合，取得了很高的艺术效果。本来在我国南部要找到一座宋代木构建筑是很不容易的。现在找到这样完整而精美的建筑组群，在全国范围来说，也是古代建筑方面的一次空前的新发现。（附图片）
