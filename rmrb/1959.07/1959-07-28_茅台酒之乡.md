    The Home of Maotai Liquor
    He Shihong
    On the border of Sichuan and Guizhou, there are many such small paths: low-lying oak and horse mulberry trees lushly cover the sky above, leaving only a sliver of light. On one side are towering cliffs and majestic rocks; on the other, the turbulent waters of the Chishui River are overflowing, wave after wave chasing forward. On the river, a thin mist lingers, water birds fly low, and small boats are bathed in a milky white haze...

    I followed this secluded path, heading towards the home of the world-renowned Maotai liquor.

    Maotai is now the seat of Renhuai County. It is famous throughout the world because it is rich in Maotai liquor.

    Two hundred and fifty years ago, Maotai was just a fishing village with only a few households. Lush green mountains, verdant waters, abundant thatch, and reeds along the banks dressed her like a sleeping beauty, simple and beautiful. In 1704, a salt merchant surnamed Guo from Qishan County, Fengxiang Prefecture, Shaanxi, came here for business. Seeing that this small fishing village was backed by mountains and facing water, with beautiful scenery, he settled down and hired workers to open a small workshop, imitating the brewing methods of Fenjiu from Xinghua Village in Shanxi and Xifeng liquor from Fengxiang in Shaanxi, and made Maotai liquor. Later, Maotai established three factories named Chengyi, Ronghe, and Hengxing, calling themselves Huamao, Wangmao, and Jingmao, specializing in production, and the scale of brewing and production technology developed to a certain extent. In 1919, countries from all over the world held a world-famous wine competition in Panama, South America, and China's eight famous wines also participated in the competition. At that time, due to China's low international status, foreign capitalists always wanted to belittle the status of Maotai liquor. However, the colorless, transparent, mellow, and sweet characteristics of Maotai liquor could not but amaze those potbellies. The competition still had to rate Maotai liquor, which should have been first in quality, as the second in the world, second only to brandy.

    Despite the fame of Maotai liquor, and Maotai becoming a place people yearned for, at that time, because capitalists seized the exclusive right to brewing technology, they did not hesitate to use various means to cruelly exploit workers and suppress the production of Maotai liquor in order to obtain high profits. Therefore, the output has always been very low, and the highest annual output only reached 60 tons. Maotai liquor workers still could not escape the tragic situation of "no three days of sunshine, no three miles of flat land, and no three cents of silver." It was not until after liberation that this bright and dazzling exotic flower—Maotai liquor—released its extraordinary brilliance.

    In recent years, the Party and the government have attached great importance to the production of Maotai liquor. The state has invested more than 1.9 million yuan to build new factory buildings of more than 10,900 square meters, which is more than 34 times the building area before liberation. Last year, the annual output of Maotai liquor reached 627 tons, which is nearly ten times higher than the highest annual output before liberation. Today, it is not only sold in major cities in China but also has a very broad overseas market. People who have tasted Maotai liquor feel supremely fortunate to be able to drink this sweet nectar...

    When you stand on the hillside and overlook Maotai: here, from Yangliuwan to Datiankan, on the slope of more than three miles, rows of tall and wide new-style factory buildings are neatly and clearly arranged along the Chishui River, and the towering chimneys are filled with thick smoke, and the long dragon-like pumping machines are rolling.

    Crossing the pontoon bridge from the old city area, head towards the Maotai Liquor Factory. Passing through the busy freight trucks and cars whizzing by, what greets you are the enthusiastic and radiant smiling faces of the workers. And the bursts of tempting aroma of Maotai liquor. The workers are busy lifting the mash, dispensing medicine, steaming and roasting, and packing boxes, talking and laughing, and the singing is endless.

    In recent years, the workers of the Maotai Liquor Factory have achieved excellent results in production. They have successively sent factory director Wang Shaobin, senior technician Zheng Yixin, and young worker Lu Dengchang to Beijing to meet Chairman Mao, and won the gold-lettered red flags from the State Council, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Guizhou Provincial People's Committee. This year, in order to welcome the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, everyone discussed brewing more than 1,000 tons of Maotai liquor. All the employees of the factory have overfulfilled the production plan for the first five months. Inspired by the early completion of the production task for the second quarter to present a gift to July 1st, the comrades are all enthusiastic and trying every means to improve operations and implement clever tactics. The workers in the brewing and roasting workshop told me: "At present, medicine production, grain grinding, and water absorption have all been done by machines, and most workshops have realized truck transportation, ball bearingization, door-opening of steamers, and pouring of bottles." Soon, with the full realization of the mechanized system, at that time, not only will physical labor be greatly reduced, but also the transparent liquor will flow like a stream of silver day and night...

    Dear friends! Are you proud of having our "King of Liquor"? Do you want to smell the fragrance of Maotai liquor? Let us remotely wish the people who produce Maotai liquor for us good health!

### 茅台酒之乡

    茅台酒之乡
    何世红
    川黔边境，有不少这样的小径：低矮的柞树林和马桑林蓊蓊郁郁的，把头上的天遮得只剩一线。一面是悬岩峭壁，巨石巍峨；一面是赤水河水正泛滥着混浊的波涛，一浪追一浪地奔逐前去。河上，薄雾缭绕，水鸟低飞，小船沐浴在一抹乳白色的云烟下面……。
    我踏着这样幽僻的小径，奔向驰名中外的茅台酒之乡。
    茅台现在是仁怀县治所在地。她誉满全球，就因为她盛产茅台酒。
    二百五十年前，茅台只不过是一个仅有寥寥几户人家的渔村。青葱的山，碧绿的水，丰盛的茅草和夹岸的芦花，把她打扮得像一个睡美人，朴素而又美丽。1704年，陕西凤翔府岐山县有一姓郭的盐商经商到了此地，见这小小渔村依山傍水，风光明媚，便定居下来，并且在这里招雇工人开了个小作坊，仿照山西杏花村的汾酒和陕西凤翔的西凤酒的酿造方法，制成了茅酒。以后，茅台成立了成义、荣和、恒兴三个厂号，自称华茅、王茅、粳茅三家，专业经营，酿造规模和制作技术都有了一定的发展。1919年，世界各国在南美洲的巴拿马召开闻名于世的酒赛会，我国的八大名酒也在参加比赛之列。当时，由于我国国际地位很低，外国资本家总想贬低茅酒的地位，但茅酒的无色透明、醇香回甜的特色，不能不使那些大肚皮们惊叹不已，赛会仍只得把质量该属第一的茅台酒评为世界第二位，仅次于白兰地。
    尽管茅酒负有盛名，茅台也成了人们向往的地方，但那时，由于资本家夺取了酿造技术的独占权，他们为了获得高额利润，不惜采用种种手段残酷地剥削工人和压制茅酒的生产，因而产量一直很低，最高年产量只达到过六十吨。茅酒工也仍然摆脱不了“天无三日晴、地无三里平、人无三分银”的悲惨境遇。一直到解放后，这一朵鲜艳夺目的奇花——茅酒，才放出了奇异的光彩。
    几年来，党和政府对茅酒的生产，给予了极大的重视。国家先后投资了一百九十多万元，新建了厂房一万零九百多平方米，比解放前的建筑面积增加三十四倍多。去年，茅酒的年产量达到了六百二十七吨，较解放前的最高年产量提高了近十倍。如今，它不但销售于国内各大城市，而且有极其广阔的国外市场。尝到茅台酒的人，都以能喝到这甘美的玉液琼浆而感到无上的幸运……
    当你站在山坡上俯视茅台：这里，从杨柳塆到大田坎三里多路的坡地上，一列列高大宽阔的新式厂房，整齐而明晰地排列在赤水河边，高耸云天的烟囱浓烟缭绕，长龙般的抽水机滚滚转动。
    从老市区跨过浮桥，向茅酒厂走去。越过那些穿梭来往、呜呜直叫的运货架车和汽车，迎着你的是工人同志们一张张热情洋溢、神采焕发的笑脸。以及阵阵诱人的茅酒的清香。工人们正在忙着掀糟、放药、蒸烤、装箱，一个个谈笑风生，歌声不绝。
    几年来，茅酒厂的工人同志们在生产上取得了优异的成绩，他们先后派了厂长王少彬、老技师郑一新、青年工人卢登常到北京见到了毛主席，获得了国务院、团中央和贵州省人委的金字红旗。今年，为了迎接祖国的十周年大庆，大伙商议要酿出千吨以上的茅酒。全厂职工已经超额完成了前五个月的生产计划，在提早完成第二季度的生产任务向七一献礼的鼓舞下，同志们个个干劲冲天，千方百计地改进操作，实行巧战。酿烤车间的工人告诉我：“目前，制药、磨粮、吸水已作到全部机器操作，绝大多数车间实现了运输车子化、滚珠轴承化、甑子开门化和瓶子倒浆化。”不久，随着全部机械化的系统实现，那时，体力劳动不只将大大减轻，而且透明的酒液将像一股银水一样不分昼夜地流……
    亲爱的朋友！你是否以有我们的“酒中王”而自豪？是否想闻一闻茅酒的芳香？让我们遥祝为我们生产茅酒的人们的健康吧！
