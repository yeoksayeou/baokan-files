    Strict Requirements
    Xue Xian

    Currently, most universities are actively preparing for final exams, and a few schools have already completed them. Examinations are the last important part of the school's work in a semester. Through examinations, we can check the effectiveness of teaching and consolidate and improve students' knowledge. Conscientiously implementing the examination and assessment system is very beneficial to improving the quality of teaching.

    In the process of conscientiously implementing the examination and assessment system, we can reflect the school's strict requirements for teachers, requiring them to be conscientious and responsible and to teach students well; we can also reflect students' strict requirements for themselves and strict requirements for teachers, requiring themselves to study diligently and requiring teachers to teach well, tutor well, and grade homework well; and, more importantly, it can reflect teachers' strict requirements for students, requiring students to study well and giving play to the leading role of teachers in teaching. Therefore, implementing the examination and assessment system is of great significance for schools to improve the normal teaching order and for urging teachers and students to improve the quality of teaching.

    We know that only when teachers teach well and students study hard can we continuously improve the quality of teaching. Students' serious study depends on their own awareness and enthusiasm, and also depends on the teacher's guidance, inspection, and help. Therefore, the teacher's responsibility is not only to prepare and teach lessons seriously and conscientiously, imparting their scientific knowledge and learning research experience to students without reservation, but also to pay attention to guiding and grading students' homework, and to supervise and assist students in their studies, strictly examine students' academic performance, and carefully check and improve their teaching effectiveness.

    When implementing the examination and assessment system, some teachers worry that strict requirements for students to study well will hinder the democratic and equal teacher-student relationship. This is a misunderstanding. The democratic and equal teacher-student relationship we are talking about refers to the equal status of teachers and students in the face of political principles and scientific truth. The democratic and equal teacher-student relationship, as manifested in teaching, is to give full play to the leading role of teachers and the enthusiasm and initiative of students under the leadership of the Party committee, so as to achieve mutual teaching and learning. To consolidate and develop this new type of teacher-student relationship, for teachers, the first thing to do is to be truly responsible, to carry out teaching work conscientiously, and to give full play to their role in teaching. The strict requirements that teachers put forward to students in teaching are not the personal requirements of the teachers, but the fulfillment of the tasks assigned to them by the country. In terms of method, we should help students learn well through patient enlightenment education. For students, the first thing to do is to humbly and earnestly learn the knowledge imparted by teachers, study hard, and strictly demand themselves; but they can also make criticisms and suggestions on teachers' teaching work and content.

    Now, improving the quality of teaching in universities has become the central link in school work. At present, we must first tighten the final examination, strictly and conscientiously assess students' grades, so that students can comprehensively and firmly master scientific knowledge and continuously improve their learning level. The teachers of Beijing Mining Institute enthusiastically and meticulously helped students systematically review their lessons before the exam, conscientiously put forward exam questions according to the requirements of the teaching syllabus, and seriously and comprehensively evaluated students' grades. This responsible spirit is commendable.

    严格要求
    学先
    目前，多数高等学校正在积极准备期终考试，少数学校已经考试完毕。考试是一学期学校工作最后一个重要环节。通过考试，可以检查教学效果，可以巩固和提高学生所学的知识。认真执行考试考查制度，对于提高教学质量有很大好处。
    在认真执行考试考查制度的过程中，可以体现学校对教师的严格要求，要求他们认真负责，把学生教好；也可以体现学生对自己的严格要求，和对教师的严格要求，要求自己刻苦钻研，要求教师讲好、辅导好和批改作业好；更可以体现教师对学生的严格要求，要求学生学好，发挥教师在教学工作中的主导作用。因此，贯彻执行考试考查制度，对于学校健全正常的教学秩序，对于督促师生提高教学质量，都有很大的作用。
    我们知道，只有教师认真教好，学生认真学好，才能不断提高教学质量。而学生认真学好，要靠学生本身的自觉性和积极性，并有赖于教师的教导、检查和帮助。因此，教师的责任不仅在于严肃认真地备课、讲课，把自己的科学知识和学习研究心得无保留地传授给学生，而且要注意指导和批改学生的作业，并对学生的学习进行督促和辅导，严格地考核学生的学习成绩，认真地检查和改进自己的教学效果。
    在贯彻执行考试考查制度时，有些教师担心，严格要求学生学好，会妨碍民主平等的师生关系。这是一种误解。我们所说的民主平等的师生关系，是指教师和学生在政治原则和科学真理面前居于平等地位。民主平等的师生关系，表现在教学工作上，就是要在党委领导下，既充分发挥教师的主导作用，又充分发挥学生的积极性、主动性，实现教学相长。要巩固和发展这种新型的师生关系，对教师来说，首先要切实负责，认真进行教学工作，在教学中很好地发挥自己的作用。教师在教学上对学生提出严格的要求，并不是教师个人的要求，而是履行国家交给自己的任务。在方法上应当是通过耐心的启发教育，帮助学生学好。对学生来说，首先应当虚心认真地学习教师传授的知识，勤学苦钻，严格要求自己；但也可以对教师的教学工作和内容提出批评和建议。
    现在高等学校提高教学质量已成为学校工作的中心环节。在目前，首先要把紧期终考试这一关，严格认真地考核学生的成绩，使学生全面牢固地掌握科学知识和不断提高学习水平。北京矿业学院的教师们在考试前热情、细致地帮助学生系统复习功课，认真地根据教学大纲的要求提出考试题目，严肃地全面评定学生的成绩，这种认真负责的精神是可贵的。
