In accordance with the State Council's directive on developing traditional Chinese medicinal materials and under the guidance of the principle of "implementing local production and local supply," various counties and cities in Jilin Province, with their People's Communes, are actively and systematically transforming wild medicinal materials into domesticated and cultivated ones, vigorously developing medicinal material production in conjunction with diversified operations.

Many areas have developed the production of authentic medicinal materials native to Jilin Province and those that have been successfully trial-planted, adapting to local conditions. Currently, the province has cultivated over 52 types of medicinal materials such as garden ginseng (artificially cultivated ginseng), codonopsis pilosula, asarum, and fritillaria, covering an area of over 14,000 mu, an increase of over 7,000 mu compared to 1958. Garden ginseng alone has increased by 1,900 mu. More than 30 counties and cities across the province have adopted methods of transforming wild medicinal materials into domesticated and cultivated ones and planting southern medicinal materials in the north, based on local climate and soil conditions. They have introduced and trial-planted 72 types of medicinal materials such as angelica sinensis, angelica dahurica, dioscorea opposita, rehmannia glutinosa, ophiopogon japonicus, and rheum palmatum, with a planting area of over 660 mu. Currently, the majority of these medicinal materials are growing well. Some counties and cities have also established medicinal material cultivation technical schools and experimental farms to train specialized personnel in planting medicinal materials.

Medicinal material management departments at all levels in Jilin Province have adopted methods of going deep into the grassroots, assigning responsibility to specific areas, and providing roving guidance to assist communes in formulating medicinal material production plans, signing production guarantee contracts with communes, and implementing the method of collecting dried, fresh, wholesale, and retail medicinal materials, ensuring that they collect medicinal materials wherever they are available. The province plans to purchase 50% more varieties than last year. (Attached picture)

    人参之乡扩大参田
    吉林增种园参一千九百亩
    本报讯　吉林省各县市根据国务院关于发展中药材的指示，在“实行就地生产就地供应”的方针指导下，各人民公社结合多种经营，积极而有步骤的变野生药材为家养家种药材，大力发展药材生产。
    许多地区因地制宜地发展了吉林省原有的和已试种成功的地道药材生产。目前，全省已种植园参（人工种植人参）、党参、细辛、贝母等药材五十二种，面积达一万四千多亩，比1958年增加了七千多亩，其中仅园参就增加了一千九百亩。全省已有三十多个县、市，根据本地气候和土壤等自然条件，实行了变野生药材为家养家种和南药北植的方法，已引种和试种当归、白芷、山药、生地、寸冬、大黄等七十二种，种植面积为六百六十多亩。现在，这些药材绝大部分都生长良好。有的县市还成立了药材培植技术学校和试验场，培养种植药材的专门人材。
    吉林省各级药材经营部门，采取深入基层，分片包干，巡回指导的办法，协助公社制定药材生产计划，同公社签订保产保收合同，实行干、鲜、零、整都收的办法，做到了哪里有药材就到哪里收。全省计划收购的品种比去年增加50％。（附图片）
