Anshan Iron and Steel Company Grasps Quality, Output, Conservation, and Management
Advance Triumphantly to Seize Greater Victories in the Third Quarter

(Our newspaper, Anshan, 2nd dispatch) The workers of all factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, in the midst of the rectification movement centered on improving enterprise management and exceeding state plans, have unanimously expressed their intention to build on the victories achieved in the first half of the year, further resolve key production issues, advance triumphantly, and strive to achieve even greater accomplishments in the third quarter.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company workers, fighting on the iron and steel front, achieved brilliant results in the first half of the year. Major products such as steel billets, steel, iron ore, and coke have all completed or exceeded state plans. Among them, steel production increased by 45.5% compared to the same period last year, and iron and steel each increased by more than 20%. The output and quality of iron and steel have increased month by month. The average daily production in June was more than 2,900 tons of steel and 2,700 tons of iron more than in January, and the quality of steel ingots and steel has improved significantly.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company workers are undertaking even greater tasks in the third quarter. Daily production in the third quarter must be more than 2,200 tons of iron and 1,600 tons of steel more than the average daily production in the first half of the year. The requirements for quality and variety are also more stringent. The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Committee held several meetings in June to study and formulate measures to complete the third quarter and the second half of the year's plans. The meeting proposed that it is necessary to further strengthen the leadership of the Party, improve the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, vigorously carry out the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technical revolution for high yield, high quality, and reduced costs, and resolutely exceed the state plan.

Currently, workers in each factory are deeply discussing the July plan. Everyone is determined to overcome the sweltering heat and strive to achieve a complete victory in the first month of the third quarter. The workers of the No. 3 blast furnace, whose utilization coefficient reached 2.26 in late June, are determined to seize the blast furnace championship from the No. 9 blast furnace. In the past two days, they have achieved the best results since the furnace was opened. The workers of the No. 9 blast furnace are also studying specific countermeasures to make the red flag take root on their furnace. The Communist Party members of the open-hearth furnace workshop of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant held a meeting on July 2 to exchange experiences from the second quarter. The No. 6 open-hearth furnace, famous for its good maintenance of equipment and comprehensive implementation of the operation policy of "more loading, fast refining, and maintenance of the furnace body," and its competitor, the No. 4 open-hearth furnace, jointly proposed a four-way competition to other open-hearth furnaces at the meeting: compare output, compare furnace body maintenance, compare safety, and compare conservation, and strive for high yields every month in the third quarter. This pair of comrades-in-arms made outstanding achievements in the first half of the year, winning the championship and runner-up titles of the entire plant. On the rolling mill front, although major rolling mills such as the primary rolling mill and the large rolling mill will undergo major repairs in the third quarter, the rolling mill workers are determined to produce more high-quality steel for the country than in the second quarter.

(Our newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd dispatch) Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, on the basis of achieving great achievements in steel production in the first half of this year, has made careful arrangements for the production plan for the third quarter, and all employees of the company are determined to continue to exert their efforts and create more brilliant achievements to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

The company's steel production in the first half of this year increased by 41% compared to the same period last year, and the production of steel plates and sections increased by 42.58% compared to the same period last year. However, the production task in the third quarter of this year is more arduous than in the second quarter. The steel task alone will increase by 53.18% compared to the actual output in the second quarter. The new production tasks require that raw material production management, transportation, and labor arrangements must keep up accordingly.

It is necessary to implement the policy of combining strengthening production management with continuing to vigorously promote mass movements, establish and improve necessary responsibility systems, and give play to the role of various functional departments. The manager and factory director personally grasp three reports every day to check and solve relevant problems in production; the workshop establishes a furnace chief (foreman, machine chief) responsibility system, unifies smelting methods, and unifies three-shift operation. At the same time, technical management work has been vigorously restored and strengthened, a technical supervision department has been established to provide full-time leadership for product quality. The technical supervision stations originally delegated to the workshops are also submitted to the company's technical supervision department for leadership. In terms of furnace equipment maintenance and repair, the company has also adopted a policy of combining strengthening management systems with mass movements, organizing a machinery and equipment repair department to regularly inspect and repair various production equipment, and at the same time, deeply carrying out mass furnace protection campaigns, implementing "standing guard" everywhere, and preventing problems early.

In addition, in terms of transportation and raw material management, the company has also taken a number of measures, such as concentrating some construction forces to rush to lay and improve unreasonable lines in the factory, and adding and expanding material yards to actively handle waste steel, etc. (Attached picture)

    鞍钢重钢抓质量　抓产量　抓节约　抓管理
    乘胜前进夺取第三季度更大胜利
    本报鞍山2日电　鞍钢各厂矿职工最近在以改进企业管理、超额完成国家计划为中心的鸣放整改运动中，一致表示要在上半年获得胜利的基础上，进一步解决生产关键问题，乘胜前进，争取第三季度获得更大的成就。
    奋战在钢铁战线上的鞍钢职工，上半年获得了辉煌的战果。钢坯、钢材、铁矿石、焦炭等主要产品，都完成或超额完成了国家计划。其中钢的产量比去年同期增长了45.5％，铁和钢材各增长20％以上。钢铁的产量、质量都逐月上升。6月份平均每天要比1月份多生产二千九百多吨钢和二千七百多吨铁，钢锭和钢材的质量都提高了很多。
    鞍钢职工在第三季度担负着更大的任务。第三季度每天要比上半年平均日产量多生产二千二百多吨铁，一千六百多吨钢。质量和品种的要求也更为严格。中共鞍山市委和鞍钢委员会在6月份就几次开会，研究制定了完成第三季度和下半年计划的措施。会议提出，必须进一步加强党的领导，健全党委领导下的厂长负责制，大搞以技术革命为中心的高产、优质、降低成本的增产节约运动，坚决超额完成国家计划。
    目前，各厂职工正在深入讨论7月份计划。大家都决心要战胜酷暑，力争在第三季度的第一个月就获得全胜。6月下旬利用系数已达到二点二六的三高炉的职工，决心将高炉冠军从九高炉夺过来。最近两天，他们已经获得了开炉以来最好的成绩。九高炉职工也在研究具体对策，要使红旗在自己的炉子上生根。第一炼钢厂平炉车间的共产党员们，在7月2日举行了交流第二季度经验的会议。以维护好设备，全面贯彻“多装、快炼、维护炉体”的操作方针出名的六号平炉和它的竞赛对手四号平炉一起，在会上向其他平炉提出了比产量、比维护炉体、比安全、比节约的四比倡议，争取第三季度月月高产。这一对战友在上半年都做出了出色的成绩，夺得了全厂冠军和亚军的称号。轧钢战线上，虽然初轧、大型等主要轧钢厂在第三季度都要大修，但轧钢工人们决心要比第二季度为国家生产更多的优质钢材。
    本报重庆2日电　重庆钢铁公司在今年上半年钢铁生产获得巨大成绩的基础上，周密安排第三季度生产计划，全公司职工决心继续鼓足干劲，创造更辉煌的成绩迎接国庆十周年。
    这个公司今年上半年钢铁产量比去年同期增长41％，钢板和型钢产量比去年同期增长42.58％。但是，今年第三季度的生产任务比二季度更艰巨，仅钢的任务就比第二季度实际产量增加53.18％。新的生产任务要求在原材料生产管理、交通运输、劳动力安排等方面，必须相应跟上去。
    必须贯彻加强生产管理和继续大搞群众运动相结合的方针，建立和健全必要的责任制度，发挥各职能部门的作用。经理、厂长每天亲自抓三次汇报，检查和解决生产中的有关问题；车间建立炉长（车长、机长）责任制，统一冶炼方法，统一三班操作。同时，大力恢复和加强了技术管理工作，成立技术监督处，对产品质量进行专职领导。原下放到车间的技术监督站，也提交公司技术监督处领导。在炉子设备的维护检修方面也采取加强管理制度与群众运动相结合的方针，组织机器设备修理部，定期检查和修理各种生产设备，同时，深入开展群众性的护炉运动，处处实行“站岗放哨”，及早预防。
    此外在交通运输和原材料管理方面，公司也采取了若干措施如集中部分修建力量突击铺设和改善厂里不合理的线路，并增设和加大料场，积极处理废钢铁等。（附图片）
