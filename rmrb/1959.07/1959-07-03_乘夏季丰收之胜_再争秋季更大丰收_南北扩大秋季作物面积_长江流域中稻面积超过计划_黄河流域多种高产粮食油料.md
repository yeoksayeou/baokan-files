Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: The transplanting of mid-season rice in provinces along the Yangtze River Basin has been completed ahead of schedule.

　　This year, the planting area of mid-season rice in major producing areas has increased. Sichuan Province originally planned to plant 30 million mu of mid-season rice, but has actually planted more than 39 million mu. Hubei Province expanded its mid-season rice planting area by 3 million mu compared to the plan. Other provinces such as Anhui, Guangxi, and Shanghai have also increased their planting areas beyond the plan. Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, which originally did not plan to plant mid-season rice, have also planted some.

　　The planting density of mid-season rice in various regions has slightly increased compared to the past, generally with 20,000 to 30,000 holes per mu, and the phenomena of over-density and under-density are relatively rare. According to inspections in Baise, Liuzhou, and Guilin Special Districts of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 80% meet the specifications for reasonable close planting.

　　Currently, some early-planted mid-season rice has entered the peak tillering period, and late-planted mid-season rice has also turned green. Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, and other regions have begun field management work for mid-season rice. Hunan Province, based on past experience, is focusing on cultivating, topdressing, pest and disease control, and flood and drought prevention, with 80% of the mid-season rice having already been cultivated and topdressed once. Some communes in Hubei Province are waging a major battle for mid-season rice tillering. Huanggang Special District has established a special team to cultivate mid-season rice, and most of the mid-season rice has already been cultivated and topdressed. In the spirit of both planting well and managing well, various parts of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have launched a mid-season rice field management campaign centered on accumulating fertilizer, and over one-third of the mid-season rice in the entire autonomous region has been cultivated. According to reports from various regions, mid-season rice is generally growing well.

　　Relevant departments of the Ministry of Agriculture believe that insufficient base fertilizer is a serious problem in current mid-season rice production. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of mid-season rice, all regions should pay special attention to the important links of accumulating fertilizer and topdressing during the major campaign of mid-season rice field management.

Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: The summer planting of late-autumn crops in wheat-harvesting areas has largely been completed, and areas north of the Yellow River with later wheat harvests are now vigorously rushing to plant.

　　It is reported that the regions south of the Yellow River with faster summer planting progress have basically completed their summer planting tasks. Henan Province had sown more than 43,560,000 mu by June 22, accounting for 72% of the summer planting plan area. Anhui Province had completed the sowing of more than 41,610,000 mu by June 29, accounting for 80% of the planned sowing area. The summer planting progress in northern Hebei Province and the suburbs of Beijing, where wheat harvesting is later, is also rapid, and can be completed within days.

　　In order to strive for an autumn harvest, people's communes in various regions have expanded the summer planting area as much as possible during the summer planting season, especially expanding the area of high-yield grain crops and oil crops. Henan Province's summer corn planting has exceeded the province's planned planting area by 19.5%, soybeans by 18.7%, and sesame by 9.8%. Shulu County, Hebei Province, earnestly implemented the principle of planting more and harvesting more, and expanded the county's summer planting area from the original plan of 560,000 mu to 720,000 mu, and mobilized the masses to plant all idle land. The county also actively increased the planting of high-yield crops - sweet potatoes. Seven communes planted more than 32,000 mu of summer sweet potatoes. In order to compensate for the shortage of peanut planting, Linyi Special District, Shandong Province, actively expanded the soybean planting area during summer planting. By June 21, it had planted 2,270,000 mu of soybeans, an increase of 470,000 mu compared with the original plan of 1,800,000 mu. Rizhao, Junan and other six counties and cities in this special area also used small pieces of idle land and fish scale pits to increase soybean planting by more than 80,000 mu.

　　Many local people's communes rationally arranged and organized their labor force before the arrival of summer harvesting and summer planting, so the summer planting progress was faster. In the wheat harvest and summer planting, Shenshan Commune in Cangshan County, Shandong Province, used 20,000 laborers to rush to harvest wheat, and used more than 5,400 people with higher planting skills to form 498 rush planting groups, and planted more than 30,000 mu of wheat stubble land in four days. Tai'an City, Shandong Province, skillfully arranged 300,000 laborers: during the rush harvest, each production team left 5% of experienced old farmers to rush planting; after the wheat harvest was basically over, 30% of the labor force was used for threshing and 70% for rush planting, so the summer planting was more than ten days earlier than in previous years. Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, organized most of the labor and animal power to invest in rush planting, and by June 10, completed the planting of more than 710,000 mu of various crops, an increase of 30% over the same period last year. Under the slogan of "seizing grain from time," Baihe County, Shaanxi Province, launched a climax of fighting drought and rush planting. The county mobilized 30,000 laborers to fight in the fields for two days, rushing to plant more than 52,000 mu. Many places also mobilized personnel from agencies, troops, schools, factories, and urban residents to support the rural areas in rushing to harvest and rush to plant.

　　The quality of summer planting in some areas has improved compared to the past. For example, "March 8" Commune in Sixian County, Anhui Province, held a forum with old farmers, technicians, and cadres before summer planting to discuss close planting, so the planting density of crops such as beans, sweet potatoes, and corn was generally appropriate. Some communes in Anhui Province also established a summer planting inspection and acceptance system, and those that do not meet the requirements must be reworked and supplemented. After inspection, Gaolou Commune in Lingbi County found that more than 5,800 mu of summer crops in the commune lacked base fertilizer, 1,000 mu of soybeans were planted sparsely, and 7,000 mu lacked seedlings. The commune then mobilized more than 3,000 people to fight for three days, replanting the missing seedlings and the sparsely planted ones; organized more than 3,500 people to accumulate fertilizer and make fertilizer, preparing for topdressing. Due to the shortage of labor, the phenomenon of lacking base fertilizer and not plowing is still common in this year's summer planting. Various regions will make up for this by increasing topdressing and strengthening cultivation in field management.

    乘夏季丰收之胜  再争秋季更大丰收
    南北扩大秋季作物面积
    长江流域中稻面积超过计划  黄河流域多种高产粮食油料
    新华社2日讯　长江流域各省的中稻插秧工作已经超计划完成。
    今年主要中稻产区的中稻种植面积都有所增加。四川省原来计划栽插中稻三千万亩，实际已经插了三千九百多万亩。湖北省中稻的栽插面积比计划扩大了三百万亩。其他安徽、广西和上海等地也都比计划增加。今年原来没有计划栽插中稻的浙江、江西、福建三省，也插下了一部分中稻。
    各地中稻栽插密度比过去略有提高，一般每亩插了两万到三万穴，过密和偏稀现象比较少。据广西僮族自治区百色、柳州、桂林等专区检查，80％都符合合理密植的规格要求。
    目前，一部分早插的中稻已进入分蘖盛期，迟插的中稻也已返青。四川、湖南、湖北、广西等地都开始中稻的田间管理工作。湖南省根据往年的经验，正在大抓中耕追肥、治虫防病、防洪防旱等工作，有80％中稻已经中耕追肥一遍。湖北省一些公社正在大战中稻分蘖关，黄冈专区成立了专门培育中稻的班子，大部分中稻已经中耕追肥。广西僮族自治区各地本着既要种好又要管好的精神，展开了以积肥为中心的中稻田间管理运动，全自治区有三分之一以上的中稻已经耕耘。据各地反映，中稻生长一般较好。
    农业部有关部门认为，底肥不足是当前中稻生产的一个严重问题。为了争取中稻丰收，各地在大稿中稻田间管理时，要特别注意积肥和追肥这一重要环节。
    新华社2日讯　麦收区播种晚秋作物的夏种工作大部已经接近完成，黄河以北麦收较晚的地区现正大力突击抢种。
    据悉：目前黄河以南夏种进度较快的地区，已经基本完成了夏季播种任务。河南省到6月22日就已经播种了四千三百五十六万多亩，占夏种计划面积的72％，安徽省到6月29日止，播种完成了四千一百六十一万多亩，占计划播种面积的80％。麦收较迟的河北省北部和北京市郊区，现在夏种日进度也很快，日内也可以完成。
    为争取秋季丰收，各地人民公社在夏种中尽可能地扩大了夏种面积。特别是扩大了高产粮食作物和油料作物的面积。河南省夏种玉米已超过省计划种植面积19.5％，大豆超过计划18.7％，芝麻超过计划9.8％。河北省束鹿县认真贯彻了多种多收的原则，全县夏种面积由原计划的五十六万亩扩大到七十二万亩，并且发动群众种了所有的闲散土地。这个县还积极增种高产作物——甘薯，七个公社就种了三万二千多亩夏甘薯。山东省临沂专区为了弥补花生种植的不足，夏种中积极扩大了大豆的种植面积，到6月21日止，已经种植了二百二十七万亩大豆，比原计划一百八十万亩扩大了四十七万亩。这个专区的日照、莒南等六个县市，还利用小块闲散土地和鱼鳞坑等，增种大豆八万多亩。
    不少地方的人民公社，在夏收夏种到来以前，就合理地安排与组织了劳动力，因而夏种进度较快。山东省苍山县神山公社在麦收和夏种中，用二万个劳动力抢收小麦，用五千四百多名种植技术较高的人，组成四百九十八个抢种小组，四天就种了三万多亩麦茬地。山东省的泰安市把三十万个劳动力作了巧安排：在抢收时，各生产队留5％的有生产经验的老农抢种；在麦收基本结束后，用30％的劳力打场，70％的劳力抢种，因而夏种比往年提前了十多天。安徽省怀远县组织大部分的劳力、畜力投入抢种，到6月10日完成播种各种作物七十一万多亩，比去年同期增加了30％。陕西省白河县在向时间要粮的口号下，掀起了抗旱抢种高潮，全县出动三万劳动大军，在田间奋战两天，突击抢种了五万二千多亩。许多地方还动员机关、部队、学校、工厂人员和城镇居民，支援了农村的抢收抢种工作。
    部分地区夏种质量比过去提高了。如安徽省宿县“三八”公社夏种前曾召开过老农、技术人员和干部座谈会来讨论密植，因而豆类、甘薯、玉米等作物播种密度一般适宜。安徽省有的公社还建立了夏种检查验收制度，不合乎要求的要加工补课。灵璧县高楼公社经过检查出全社有五千八百多亩夏种作物底肥不足，有一千亩大豆种得稀，有七千亩缺苗，全社便发动三千多人奋战三天，对缺苗的和种得稀的进行了补苗；组织三千五百多人积肥、造肥，准备追肥。由于劳动力紧张，今年夏种中缺少底肥和没有翻耕的现象仍较多。各地将在田间管理中增施追肥和加强中耕予以补救。
