Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 27th: Workers in factories and mines in Jiangsu Province are constantly reporting successes in high-quality and high-yield production amidst the high temperatures and sweltering heat.

“Iron flows like surging waves, enthusiasm is even higher than the furnace's heat. We are determined to fight hard in the third quarter, showing heroism on the production front!” This is the slogan proposed by the steelworkers who are persisting in production every day in high temperatures. In the first half of July, the steel rolling branch of the Nanjing Yuejin Steel Plant increased its steel output by more than 40% compared to the same period last month, thanks to workers strictly adhering to operating procedures and various regulations, and strengthening cooperation between different types of work. Workers at the Xuzhou Huaihai Steel Plant launched a heated socialist labor competition. From July 1st to 20th, all six blast furnaces overfulfilled their production tasks, and the plant's pig iron production overfulfilled the plan by 2.06%; the qualified rate of pig iron reached 99.45% in the first ten days of July, and all pig iron was qualified in the middle ten days.

Xuzhou Mining Area, a key coal-producing area in Jiangsu, launched a new upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy in mid-July. The Hanqiao Coal Mine achieved excellent results in the five major production indicators of coal extraction, tunneling, etc. The average daily output of the entire mine in mid-July increased by 615 tons compared with the first ten days of the month.

Recently, factories and mines in Jiangsu Province have further strengthened labor protection work, added heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment, and cared for the health and safety of workers during the summer in all aspects. Many factories have adjusted the workers' working hours to allow them to rest better.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 28th: Workers of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company have overcome high temperatures and created new production achievements. The average daily output of pig iron from the 21st to the 25th of this month increased by more than 200 tons compared with the 1st to the 20th, and steel increased by more than 150 tons; steel production from the 1st to the 25th increased by more than 4,000 tons compared with the same period last month.

Since the beginning of dog days, cooling fans have been installed in all high-temperature workshops of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, and cooling water curtains have been installed next to the heating furnaces in the rolling mill. Many open-hearth furnaces and gas furnaces have been equipped with circulating water tanks, which significantly reduces the temperature in the workshops. After installing circulating water tanks on the gas pipelines of many open-hearth furnaces and gas furnaces, the radiant heat was reduced from nearly 100 degrees to more than 40 degrees.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 27th: Guangzhou City has recently entered the hottest season of the year. Many factories and enterprises have mobilized the masses to do a good job in preventing heatstroke and cooling down, to ensure the health of workers.

Some factories have raised the roofs and sprayed water on the roofs, some factories have opened more windows, some factories have built insulation walls, or set up water curtains to absorb heat. The temperature of the sealing and exhaust section of the Guangzhou Light Bulb Factory is often very high. The workers used some discarded wood to make exhaust pipes and extended the pipe openings to the roof to quickly exhaust hot air outdoors, which significantly lowered the indoor temperature. The workers of the Nanqiao Pharmaceutical Factory built a cold air supply duct with bricks, placed ice cubes at the air supply outlet, and used a motor to send the cold air in, which reduced the temperature of the workers' operating area by 7 to 10 degrees Celsius.

Many factories have also made reasonable adjustments to the labor organization and working hours, increased cool drinks for high-temperature workers, and organized employees to conduct a general physical examination. Workers who were found to be unsuitable for working in high temperatures were appropriately adjusted in their work.

### 降低气温　提高斗志  江苏等地厂矿企业加强劳动保护促进生产

    降低气温　提高斗志
    江苏等地厂矿企业加强劳动保护促进生产
    据新华社南京27日电　江苏省厂矿企业广大职工，在高温酷暑季节频传优质高产的捷报。
    “铁水奔腾浪滔滔，干劲更比炉温高，决心大战三季度，生产战线逞英豪。”这是天天在高温中坚持生产的钢铁工人提出的口号。7月上半月，南京跃进钢铁厂轧钢分厂由于工人们严格遵守操作规程和各项制度，加强工种与工种之间的协作，使钢材产量比上月同期增加了40％以上。徐州淮海钢铁厂的职工开展了热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛，7月1日到20日，六座高炉全部超额完成了生产任务，全厂生铁产量超额2.06％完成计划；上旬生铁合格率达99.45％，中旬生铁全部合格。
    江苏煤炭重点产地徐州矿区7月中掀起了增产节约新高潮。韩桥煤矿各工区回采、掘进等五大生产指标完成得都很好，7月中旬全矿平均日产量比上旬提高六百一十五吨。
    最近，江苏省各厂矿企业进一步加强了劳动保护工作，增添防暑降温设备，从各方面关心暑期职工的健康和安全。许多工厂调整了工人的作息时间，使他们能更好地休息。
    据新华社太原28日电　太原钢铁公司职工战胜高温，创造生产新成就。本月21日到25日的生铁平均日产量比1日到20日增长了二百多吨，钢增长了一百五十多吨；1日到25日的钢材产量比上月同期增加了四千多吨。
    入伏以来，太原钢铁公司各高温车间安置了降温风机，轧钢厂的加热炉旁也都安装了降温水幕，不少的炼钢炉和煤气炉都安上了循环水箱，显著地降低了车间气温。许多平炉煤气炉的煤气输送管道安上循环水箱后，辐射热由过去的近一百度降低到四十多度。
    据新华社广州27日电　广州市近日进入一年中最炎热的季节，许多工厂企业发动群众做好防暑降温工作，保证工人身体健康。
    有的工厂加高了屋顶，并在屋顶喷水，有的工厂加开了窗户，有的工厂砌筑了隔热墙，或是设置水幕吸收热气。广州灯泡厂封口排气工段的温度经常很高，职工们就利用一些废旧木材制成排气管，将管口伸向屋顶，使热空气迅速排出室外，室内温度显著下降。南侨制药厂的职工用砖砌了冷气送风道，在送风口放上冰块，用马达将冷气送进去，使工人操作地方的温度降低摄氏七至十度。
    许多工厂还将劳动组织和作业时间作了合理的调整，给高温工人增加了清凉饮料，并且组织职工普遍检查了身体，发现不适于在高温中工作的工人，就适当地调整工作。
