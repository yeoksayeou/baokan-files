Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The Greek authorities' persecution of the Greek national hero Glezos has aroused boundless indignation and strong protest from the Chinese people. People from all walks of life in China gathered in the capital today, representing 600 million Chinese people, to issue a strong call, resolutely demanding that the Greek national scum be stopped from persecuting Glezos, and that Glezos and other Greek patriots be immediately restored to freedom.

Mei Yi, Vice President of the Journalists Association, said:
We have an obligation to stop the persecution of Glezos
Today's rally was presided over by the All-China Journalists Association. Mei Yi, Vice President of the All-China Journalists Association, said at the beginning of the rally that two days ago, the Greek authorities, ignoring the angry protests of people all over the world, began the trial of Greek national hero Glezos and other Greek patriots in a military court in Athens. Now, not only the Greek people have stood up to defend their loyal son, but people all over the world are taking action to defend Glezos, issuing a call for justice. The Chinese people are very indignant at the Greek authorities' brutal behavior in persecuting the great patriot Glezos. In order to defend human rights, uphold justice, and for the sake of democracy, freedom, and peace, we have an obligation to stand up to stop the persecution of Glezos, rescue Glezos and other Greek patriots, and restore their freedom as soon as possible.
Speaking at the meeting were Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Zhu Ziqi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Guo Xiaochuan, Secretary-General of the Chinese Writers Association, Zhang Youyu, Vice President of the China Political Science and Law Association, Chen Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Cao Mengjun, Member of the Presidium of the All-China Women's Federation, Liu Xiyuan, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, Wang Yunsheng, President of Ta Kung Pao, Chen Jun, Director of the International Department of the People's Daily, and Wu Jingsong, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of World Knowledge Publishing House. With boundless anger, they unanimously condemned the Greek authorities' crime of persecuting the Greek national hero Glezos and demanded his immediate release.

Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said:
Chinese workers support the just struggle of the Greek people
Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said that the Chinese working class is extremely angry and strongly protests the Greek authorities' blatant disregard for the opposition of the Greek people and the people of the world in persecuting the Greek national hero and friend of peace-loving people around the world, Glezos. Li Jiebo said that in recent years, the Greek authorities have followed the war policy of US imperialism, sold out national interests, and last year agreed to the United States setting up missile bases on Greek territory, thus greatly threatening the peace of the Balkans and Europe. The Greek government has completely become a servant of US imperialism. The Greek authorities' attempt to use the persecution of Glezos and other democratic patriots to extinguish the progressive forces in the country will only promote the further development of the Greek people's struggle against imperialism and for democratic freedom.
Li Jiebo emphasized that the Chinese workers fully support the just struggle of the Greek workers and people, and the cause of justice will surely triumph. We firmly demand an immediate end to the unreasonable trial of Glezos, and he must be released immediately.

Chu Tunan, President of the Association for Cultural Exchange with Foreign Countries, said:
The Greek authorities are provoking human culture and democracy
Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, pointed out in his speech that the Greek national hero Glezos is an outstanding representative of the Greek people who love democracy, freedom, and peace and progress, and is a glorious example of fighting for peace and progress. The Greek reactionary authorities' persecution of Glezos is the most despicable provocation against human culture and democratic freedom. They are plotting to sell out the national interests of Greece, succumb to the US imperialist policy of arms expansion and war preparation, and undermine peace in the Balkans and Europe. Chu Tunan said that all peace-loving and progressive people with conscience in the world absolutely cannot tolerate the shameful attempts and malicious conspiracies of the Greek authorities. In order to safeguard peace and human dignity, we severely condemn the atrocities of the Greek authorities and resolutely demand the immediate release of Glezos and other Greek patriotic people.

Zhu Ziqi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Peace Committee, said:
The Chinese people resolutely oppose the persecution of peace fighters
Zhu Ziqi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, pointed out in his speech that in order to pave the way for accepting the US imperialist plot to establish missile bases on Greek territory, the Greek reactionary authorities are constantly intensifying the persecution of Greek patriotic people who safeguard peace and national sovereignty. This is the root cause of the unreasonable arrest and trial of Glezos and other Greek patriots. Zhu Ziqi said that the great cause of peace and freedom is invincible, and the Greek movement against US aggression policy and for democratic freedom and the defense of peace is rising. The peace-loving and freedom-loving Chinese people resolutely oppose the Greek authorities' persecution of peace and freedom fighters. The Greek people and the people of the world are uniting more closely to fight for the salvation of Glezos and other Greek patriots, and to fight for the cause of peace and justice until victory.

Guo Xiaochuan, Secretary-General of the Writers Association, said: Do not allow the Zeus of the 20th century to imprison Prometheus
Guo Xiaochuan, Secretary-General of the Chinese Writers Association, said in his speech: The eyes of people all over the world are filled with raging anger, which is spreading to the military court in Athens. Guo Xiaochuan compared Glezos to Prometheus in ancient Greek mythology who brought fire to mankind and was imprisoned by Zeus. He said: The barbaric Zeus of the 20th century is bringing disaster to the new Prometheus. But the 20th century is the century of the people, and behind Glezos and other patriots are all the Greek people and the people of the world. The angry voices of peace-loving and justice-upholding - protests and condemnations of the Greek authorities' persecution of Glezos, like a raging storm, have resounded in every corner of the world. Guo Xiaochuan said that we - the Chinese writers - must also add our voices to this storm that sweeps the world.

Zhang Youyu, Vice President of the Political Science and Law Association, said:
The Greek authorities' acts of trampling on human rights must be stopped
Zhang Youyu, Vice President of the China Political Science and Law Association, said: The persecution of Glezos by the Greek reactionary rulers is not merely a matter of Glezos' personal interests, but a matter of freedom, democracy and peace, and an attack by the reactionary forces on the entire progressive forces. He said: In order to persecute progressive people, the Greek reactionary rulers have brought out the notorious Law No. 375 enacted during the fascist dictatorship. According to this law, so-called espionage cases are tried by military courts instead of ordinary courts, and appeals are not allowed against the judgments made by military courts. They are trying to use military courts to quickly decide Glezos' fate according to their intentions. It must be pointed out that this reactionary law itself should be abolished. Many Greek people have pointed out that "it violates the Greek constitution." A proposal to abolish it has been submitted in the Greek parliament. To try Glezos according to it is a reactionary act that violates public opinion and tramples on human rights.

Chen Hansheng, Vice President of the Foreign Affairs Association, said:
Rescuing Glezos is to uphold justice
Chen Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, said that our rescue of the Greek national hero Glezos is to uphold justice and safeguard world peace, and is of great significance to the world. He said that it is very unfair for a military court to try a civilian in peacetime. This is a crazy and destructive act of democracy. He pointed out that the basic motive behind the Greek authorities' willingness to destroy democracy and frame patriotic people is to restore fascist rule and cater to the American conspiracy. Chen Hansheng said that the great Greek national hero has become a thorn in the side of the United States and the Greek reactionary group and all warmongers, and they are trying every means to remove him. However, the spearhead pointing at the Greek democratic forces today is threatening the democratic forces of the whole world, and we must defeat this attack by the reactionaries and safeguard world peace.

Cao Mengjun, Member of the Presidium of the All-China Women's Federation, said:
Chinese women protest against the Greek authorities' conspiracy
Cao Mengjun, Member of the Presidium of the All-China Women's Federation, expressed the strongest protest on behalf of the more than 300 million Chinese women against the Greek reactionary authorities' despicable conspiracy to illegally persecute Glezos. She said that the Greek authorities' arrest and trial of national hero Glezos and other patriotic people on trumped-up charges is aimed at intensifying the suppression of democratic forces in Greece, willingly acting as accomplices of US imperialism, and further relying on US imperialism and the North Atlantic Group, so as to clear the way for Greece to become a US imperialist missile base. Cao Mengjun warned the Greek reactionary authorities: Chinese women and peace-loving people and women all over the world will never allow the Greek authorities to unreasonably persecute Glezos. The Greek authorities must stop immediately.

Liu Xiyuan, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, said:
Chinese youth demand the immediate release of Glezos
Liu Xiyuan, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, expressed the Chinese youth's infinite admiration for the Greek national hero and outstanding peace fighter Glezos, and their strong protest against the Greek authorities. He said that the Greek authorities' illegal detention and trial of Glezos is a trampling on world justice and righteousness. Chinese youth have always adhered to the truth and upheld justice. We firmly demand the immediate release of Glezos and other Greek patriots, and that they not be killed, and that they be granted freedom immediately.

Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, said that Glezos' heroic behavior is deeply admired by Chinese students
Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, on behalf of the students of the whole country, fully supported Glezos and the Greek patriots in their just struggle for democracy, freedom and national independence, and strongly protested the shameless crimes of the Greek reactionaries. He said that Glezos' heroic patriotic behavior and the noble spirit of fighting for peace and democracy have not only won the love of the Greek people, but also deeply admired by the Chinese people and Chinese students. The Greek authorities' persecution of democratic forces and the traitorous policy of succumbing to US imperialism will inevitably lead to shameful failure.

Wang Yunsheng and others from the press and publishing circles pointed out:
We must restore the freedom of our peace comrade
Wang Yunsheng, President of Ta Kung Pao, said that the Greek authorities' illegal trial of Glezos is on the orders of US imperialism, challenging the Greek people and the peace-loving people of the world. Glezos has escaped from the shackles of prison twelve times for the independence and democracy of his motherland and world peace. We must help him escape from the shackles of prison once again and reclaim the freedom of our peace comrade.

Chen Jun, Director of the International Department of the People's Daily, pointed out in his speech that the reactionary conspiracy of the Greek authorities has long been seen through by the Greek and the people of the world. Many bourgeois figures in Greece, even former Prime Minister Tsouderos, said: There is not a word of truth in the accusations against Glezos. The whole of Greece and the world are now standing up to defend the outstanding peace fighter Glezos.

Wu Jingsong, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of World Knowledge Publishing House, said in his speech, why do the Greek authorities hate Glezos so much? Because Glezos represents the will of the people, and the reactionary ruling class are all echoes of US imperialism. This approach of the Greek reactionaries cannot show its strength, but only its weakness, its death throes. We firmly support the Greek people, and we loudly appeal: Do not murder the Greek national hero Glezos, and release Glezos immediately.

Speaker after speaker, their angry words expressed the voice of 600 million Chinese people: The Greek national scum has no right to try the national hero, and the Greek authorities must immediately release Glezos and other Greek patriots.

    六亿中国人民要求释放格列索斯
    我各界人士在首都集会抗议希腊当局反动行为
    新华社11日讯　希腊当局对希腊民族英雄格列索斯的迫害激起了中国人民的无比愤慨和强烈抗议。中国各界人士今天在首都集会，代表六亿中国人民发出强大呼声，坚决要求制止希腊民族败类对格列索斯的迫害，立即恢复格列索斯和希腊其他爱国者的自由。
  新闻工作者协会副会长梅益说
  我们有义务制止对格列索斯的迫害
    今天的集会由中华全国新闻工作者协会主持。中华全国新闻工作者协会副会长梅益在集会开始的时候讲话说，两天以前，希腊当局不顾全世界人民愤怒的抗议，在雅典的军事法庭开始审判希腊民族英雄格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者。现在，不但希腊人民挺身出来保卫自己的忠实的儿子，全世界各地人民都在为保卫格列索斯而采取行动，发出了正义的呼声。中国人民对希腊当局迫害伟大爱国者格列索斯的横暴行为非常愤慨。为了保卫人权、伸张正义，也为了民主、自由、和平，我们有义务起来制止对格列索斯的迫害，援救格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者，使他们早日恢复自由。
    在会上发言的，有全国总工会副主席李颉伯、中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副秘书长朱子奇、中国作家协会秘书长郭小川、中国政治法律学会副会长张友渔、中国人民外交学会副会长陈翰笙、全国妇联主席团委员曹孟君、全国青联主席刘西元、全国学联主席胡启立、大公报社长王芸生、人民日报国际部主任陈浚和世界知识社副总编辑吴景崧。他们怀着无比的愤怒，一致谴责希腊当局迫害希腊民族英雄格列索斯的罪行，要求立即释放格列索斯。
    全国总工会副主席李颉伯说
  中国工人支持希腊人民的正义斗争
    全国总工会副主席李颉伯说，中国工人阶级对希腊当局悍然不顾希腊人民和全世界人民的反对，迫害希腊民族英雄和全世界爱好和平人民的朋友格列索斯的罪行，感到极大的愤怒，并且表示强烈的抗议。李颉伯说，几年来，希腊当局追随着美帝国主义的战争政策，出卖民族利益，去年更同意美国在希腊国土上设置导弹基地，因而使巴尔干地区与欧洲的和平遭到很大威胁。希腊政府已完全成了美帝国主义的仆从了。希腊当局企图用迫害格列索斯及其他民主爱国人士的办法来扑灭国内的进步力量，只能促使希腊人民的反帝和争取民主自由斗争更加发展。
    李颉伯强调地说，中国工人完全支持希腊工人和人民的正义斗争，正义事业必将取得胜利。我们坚决要求立即停止对格列索斯的无理审讯，并且必须立即释放格列索斯。
    对外文化协会会长楚图南说
  希腊当局对人类文化和民主挑衅
    中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南在发言中指出，希腊民族英雄格列索斯是热爱民主自由和和平进步的希腊人民的杰出代表，是为和平进步事业而斗争的光辉榜样。希腊反动当局对格列索斯的迫害是对人类文化和民主自由的最卑鄙的挑衅，他们阴谋出卖希腊的民族利益，屈从美帝国主义的扩军备战政策，破坏巴尔干地区和欧洲的和平。楚图南说，对于希腊当局的可耻企图和恶毒阴谋，全世界一切有良心的热爱和平和进步的人民都绝对不能容忍。我们为了维护和平和人类的尊严，严厉斥责希腊当局的暴行，坚决要求立即释放格列索斯和其他希腊爱国人士。
  保卫和平委会副秘书长朱子奇说
  中国人民坚决反对迫害和平战士
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副秘书长朱子奇在发言中指出，希腊反动当局为了替接受美帝国主义在希腊国土上建立导弹基地的阴谋铺平道路，正在不断加紧迫害维护和平和国家主权的希腊爱国人士。这就是格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者遭到无理逮捕和审讯的根本原因。朱子奇说，和平和自由的伟大事业是不可战胜的，希腊反对美国侵略政策和争取民主自由、维护和平的运动正日益高涨。热爱和平和自由的中国人民坚决反对希腊当局迫害和平和自由的战士。希腊人民和全世界人民正更加团结一致，为拯救格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者而斗争，为维护和平和正义的事业而斗争，直到取得胜利。
    作家协会秘书长郭小川说不许二十世纪的宙斯囚禁普罗米修斯
    中国作家协会秘书长郭小川在发言中说：全世界人民的目光中，都充满了熊熊的怒火，正向雅典的军事法庭延烧开去。郭小川把格列索斯比喻为古代希腊神话中把火种带给人类因而遭到宙斯囚禁的普罗米修斯，他说：二十世纪的野蛮的宙斯正把灾难降临到新的普罗米修斯身上。但是二十世纪是人民的世纪，站在格列索斯和其他爱国者背后的是全希腊人民和全世界人民。爱好和平与主持正义的愤怒的呼声——抗议和谴责希腊当局迫害格列索斯的呼声，如同狂风巨浪一般，已经响遍世界的各个角落。郭小川说，我们——中国的作家们——也要把我们的呼声加入到全世界的这个狂风巨浪之中。
  政治法律学会副会长张友渔说
  必须制止希腊当局蹂躏人权的行为
    中国政治法律学会副会长张友渔说：希腊反动统治者迫害格列索斯，并不是仅仅涉及格列索斯个人利害的问题，而是关系到自由、民主与和平的问题，是反动势力向整个进步力量进攻的问题。他说：希腊反动统治者为了迫害进步人士，抬出了法西斯独裁统治期间制定的恶名昭彰的所谓第三百七十五号法律，依照这项法律，所谓间谍案件不由普通法院而由军事法庭审判，对军事法庭做出的判决，不得上诉。他们企图运用军事法庭，迅速地按照他们的意图，决定格列索斯的命运，必须指出，这一反动的法律本身就应当被废除，许多希腊人士都指出“它是违反了希腊宪法的”，在希腊议会里，已经提出了废除它的提案，根据它来审判格列索斯，就是违反民意，蹂躏人权的反动行为。
    外交学会副会长陈翰笙说
  援救格列索斯是为了伸张正义
    中国人民外交学会副会长陈翰笙说，我们援救希腊民族英雄格列索斯是为了伸张正义和维护世界和平，是具有世界性的重大意义的。他说，军事法庭在和平时期审讯一个平民是很不公道的。这是一个疯狂的、摧残民主的暴行。他指出，目前希腊当局所以不惜摧残民主而陷害爱国人士的基本动机，就是要恢复法西斯式的统治而去迎合美国的阴谋。陈翰笙说，伟大的希腊民族英雄已变成美国和希腊反动集团及一切好战分子的眼中钉，他们千方百计地要拔掉它。但是，指向希腊民主力量的矛头今天正威胁着全世界的民主力量，我们必须击溃反动派的这种进攻，维护世界的和平。
  全国妇联主席团委员曹孟君说
    中国妇女抗议希腊当局阴谋
    全国妇联主席团委员曹孟君在会上以三亿多中国妇女的名义，对希腊反动当局非法迫害格列索斯的卑鄙阴谋表示最强烈的抗议。她说，希腊当局以莫须有的罪名逮捕和审讯民族英雄格列索斯和其他爱国人士，其目的是加紧镇压希腊的民主力量，甘心充当美帝国主义的走卒，进一步投靠美帝国主义和北大西洋集团，为希腊变成美帝国主义的导弹基地扫清道路。曹孟君警告希腊反动当局说：中国妇女和全世界爱好和平的人民和妇女绝不允许希腊当局无理迫害格列索斯，希腊当局必须立即住手。
      全国青联主席刘西元说
  中国青年要求立即释放格列索斯
    全国青联主席刘西元的发言表达了中国青年对希腊民族英雄和杰出的和平战士格列索斯的无限敬佩，以及对希腊当局的强烈抗议。他说，希腊当局非法拘捕审讯格列索斯是对世界公理和正义的践踏。中国青年一贯坚持真理、维护正义，我们坚决要求立即释放格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者，不许杀害他们，立即让他们获得自由。
      全国学联主席胡启立说格列索斯英勇行为深受中国学生敬佩
    全国学联主席胡启立代表全国学生全力支持格列索斯和希腊爱国者为争取民主自由和民族独立而进行的正义斗争，强烈抗议希腊反动派的无耻罪行。他说，格列索斯英勇的爱国行为和为和平民主而斗争的崇高精神，不但赢得了希腊人民的爱戴，并且也深受中国人民和中国学生的敬佩。希腊当局迫害民主力量和屈从美帝国主义的卖国政策，必将遭到可耻的失败。
    新闻出版界王芸生等指出
    一定要恢复和平战友的自由
    大公报社长王芸生说，希腊当局非法审讯格列索斯，是奉美帝国主义之命，向希腊人民挑战，向全世界爱好和平的人民挑战。格列索斯为了祖国的独立民主和世界和平曾经十二次挣脱牢狱的枷锁，我们要援助他再一次挣脱牢狱的枷锁，索回我们的和平战友的自由。
    人民日报国际部主任陈浚在发言中指出，希腊当局的反动阴谋早已被希腊和全世界人民所识破。希腊许多资产阶级人士，甚至连前首相曹达利斯都说：对格列索斯的控告没有一句真话。全希腊和全世界现在都挺身出来保卫杰出的和平战士格列索斯。
    世界知识社副总编辑吴景崧在发言中说，希腊当局为什么要如此仇恨格列索斯，因为格列索斯代表人民的意志，而反动统治阶级都是美帝国主义的应声虫。希腊反动派的这种做法不能说明它的强大，只能说明它的软弱，它的垂死挣扎。我们坚决支持希腊人民，我们大声疾呼，不准谋害希腊民族英雄格列索斯，立即释放格列索斯。
    发言的人一个接着一个，他们的愤慨的话语表达了六亿中国人民的心声：希腊民族败类无权审讯民族英雄，希腊当局必须立即释放格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者。
