Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25th: The "Pravda" and "Izvestia" newspapers published on the 25th the dialogue between the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, and the US Vice President, Nixon, at the American Exhibition in Moscow.

Khrushchev had the conversation with Nixon while visiting the American Exhibition. During the visit, Khrushchev and Nixon had heated conversations more than once.

The "Izvestia" reporter's report on the course and summary of the conversation is as follows:

Accompanied by Mr. Nixon, the Soviet leader entered a "standard" American house. The host and guest stopped in the kitchen, and Khrushchev asked Nixon what materials the kitchen equipment was made of.

Nixon replied that it was made of steel and aluminum.

"I think it would be better and cheaper to use plastic," Khrushchev then suggested that Nixon visit some of the new residences recently completed in Moscow.

He said: "Then you will be convinced that our new kitchens are no less than yours."

Nixon said that in the United States, people care about the needs of housewives.

Khrushchev replied: "But after all, we respect women here more than in capitalist countries."

Khrushchev went on to say that he understood American construction technology, although he had never been to the United States.

"Of course, the houses you are exhibiting are beautiful. However, we are not going to build this kind of house. These houses are made of plywood, and they only last for twenty years. This is not only my opinion. Representatives of American construction companies have said so themselves. We used to buy this kind of house from Finland ourselves, but now we don't buy them anymore because it's not cost-effective. Houses must be built solidly with reinforced concrete and bricks so that our children and grandchildren can live in them."

Mr. Nixon said that the grandchildren's hobbies might be different. Khrushchev retorted: "Yes, that is indeed possible." He added: "But the furniture can be replaced, but the houses do not have to be torn down and burned. This (referring to demolition and burning - Xinhua editor's note) only meets the interests of private construction companies, not the interests of residents."

Khrushchev said to Nixon: "The American propaganda machine incorrectly promotes the Soviet way of life. Therefore, Mr. Nixon, I would like to tell you an Eastern joke. An Islamic priest was walking on the road one day. Someone asked him where he was going, and he replied that he was going there, to that mountain, where they were said to be giving out free meat fried rice. So people flocked in the direction pointed by the Islamic priest, and when the Islamic priest saw this situation, he himself believed his own lie - could it be that they really are giving out free meat fried rice there? So he ran with everyone else. Your country's propaganda is like this," Khrushchev said amidst the laughter of those around him, "You conjure up strange images of the Soviets out of thin air, and then you believe your own conjurations. This time you are exhibiting houses with kitchens, thinking that this kind of house will surprise the Soviets. But if an American can afford such a house, he must have a lot of dollars, while a Soviet has the right to ask the chairman of the city soviet for housing. Everyone knows that in our country, housing costs are very, very low. Housing costs can be said to be symbolic. You talk a lot about your freedom, but among these freedoms there is also the freedom to spend the night under a bridge."

Vice President Nixon changed the subject and said to Khrushchev to pay attention to washing machines, that it is better to compete in the production of washing machines than to compete in the production of rockets.

Comrade Khrushchev joked: "I didn't even recognize you, Mr. Nixon. If your thoughts are really as you say, then we can easily reach an agreement with you. But your generals are clamoring about rockets, not kitchen utensils. It is they who are threatening us with rockets, it is they who are showing off, saying they can wipe us off the face of the earth. Of course, we will not allow anyone to do this. And to those who want to do this, we will tell them, as our Russian proverb says, to give them a bit of color to see."

This idiom stumped the translators.

Mr. Nixon suggested, "Let's talk about this next time."

Khrushchev objected, "Why next time? Let's talk about it now."

Vice President Nixon believed that in international relations, one should not issue orders or make ultimatums, because this would prompt one side to go to war.

Khrushchev replied to Mr. Nixon that he agreed with Nixon's view, but the whole problem was who was actually issuing orders and making ultimatums. As for talk about war, that kind of talk is a threat.

Khrushchev warned: "But threats don't work on us, and they never will. You won't get anywhere using that against us. Whatever you have, we have too, and better than yours at that. But isn't it better for us to be friends? We are willing to be friends with the United States and all other countries. So it is best to drop the talk of issuing orders and ultimatums. Let's not grab the dead cat by the tail."

Nixon said: "I like what you said, you would be a very good speaker in our America."

Khrushchev joked: "I grabbed the dead cat by the tail to liven up the conversation. But the main dead cat I want to talk about is the military bases on foreign territories. Whoever advocates maintaining such bases is against peace, and whoever advocates abolishing them is for peace. We have abolished our military bases, we have greatly reduced our armed forces, and we hope to eliminate the serious remnants of war - we hope to sign a peace treaty with Germany and abolish the occupation regime in West Berlin. If all this is done, then peace can be guaranteed, and we don't have to grab the dead cat by the tail anymore."

Nixon asked Khrushchev if he thought the Geneva conference could be successful?

Khrushchev said: "Of course it is, because we are not wasting money by having Foreign Minister Gromyko stay in Geneva. Comrade Gromyko is a good person, we awarded him the Lenin Medal not long ago. But for the Geneva conference to be successful, all participants in the negotiations must cooperate. The question of peace or war is not a question that can be argued and discussed. Doing so will not lead to good results. There is only one answer to this question - peace."

Nixon joked: "It is said that Mr. Gromyko looks like me."

Khrushchev then replied to him: "Only in appearance." He then turned to the Geneva conference issue again. He said: "If you want this conference to succeed, then you shouldn't scare us with a deadlock. This, like issuing orders, is a waste of effort."

Khrushchev shook hands with the demonstrator of the kitchen equipment, an elderly American woman.

He said: "Thank you, hostess, you gave us the opportunity to have this debate in the kitchen."

At the exit of the "standard" American house, Khrushchev pointed out two Soviet youths to Nixon.

Khrushchev said: "Look, what great eagles! With such eagles, what threats does our government have to fear? Please take a closer look at them, do they look like slaves?! And you are holding the so-called 'Captive Nations Week' in the United States. What kind of slaves are these?"

The young men smiled and replied: "Nikita Sergeyevich, we have even forgotten the word, forgotten the meaning of the word."

Nixon also pointed to two American youths there and said: "Aren't our eagles good either?"

Khrushchev said: "Then they should make friends. How many good things they can do together!"

### 共产主义真理压下资本主义邪气  赫鲁晓夫妙语说倒尼克松

    共产主义真理压下资本主义邪气
    赫鲁晓夫妙语说倒尼克松
    新华社莫斯科25日电　“真理报”和“消息报”25日发表了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和美国副总统尼克松在莫斯科的美国展览会上的对话。
    赫鲁晓夫是在参观美国展览会的时候同尼克松交谈的。在参观的过程中，赫鲁晓夫和尼克松不止一次地进行热烈的交谈。
    “消息报”记者报道谈话的经过和内容摘要如下：
    在尼克松先生陪同下，苏联领导人走进了“标准的”美国房屋。宾主双方在厨房里停下来，赫鲁晓夫问尼克松，厨房设备是用什么材料做的。
    尼克松回答说，是用钢和铝做的。
    “我认为，用塑料做会更好、更便宜些。”赫鲁晓夫接着建议尼克松参观最近在莫斯科落成的一些新住宅。
    他说：“那时您就会相信，我们的新厨房毫不亚于你们的厨房。”
    尼克松说，在美国，人们关心家庭主妇的需要。
    赫鲁晓夫回答说：“可是毕竟是我们这里比资本主义国家更尊重妇女。”
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，他了解美国的建筑技术，虽然他没有到过美国。
    “当然，你们展出的房屋是漂亮的。不过，我们不准备建筑这种房屋。这种房屋是用胶合板做的，它们保持不过二十年。这不仅是我的看法。美国建筑公司的代表自己也这样说过。过去我们自己曾经向芬兰买过这种房屋，但是现在我们不再买了，因为这是不上算的。房屋必须用钢筋混凝土和砖牢固地建造起来，使我们的子子孙孙能住下去。”
    尼克松先生说，子孙们的爱好可能不同。赫鲁晓夫反驳说：“不错，这的确是可能的”。他补充说：“不过家具可以更换，而房屋却不必拆毁和烧掉。这（按指拆毁和烧掉——新华社编者注）仅仅符合私人建筑公司的利益，而不符合居民的利益”。
    赫鲁晓夫对尼克松说：“美国的宣传机构不正确地宣扬了苏联人的生活方式。因此，尼克松先生，我想对您讲一个东方的笑话。一个伊斯兰教士有一次在路上走。当时有人问他到哪儿去，他回答说，就到那儿，到那座山上去，据说，那里免费发给肉炒饭。于是人们便向这个伊斯兰教士所指的方向涌去，当这个伊斯兰教士看到这种情况时，他本人也相信了自己的谎言——可能，那里真的免费发给肉炒饭？于是他就跟大家一起跑去了。贵国的宣传就是这样的——赫鲁晓夫在周围人的笑声中说——你们自己凭空想像出苏联人的稀奇古怪的模样，而后你们自己也就相信了自己的凭空想像。这次你们展出了设有厨房的房屋，认为这种房屋能使苏联人感到惊异。可是一个美国人买得起这样房屋，他就得有很多美元，而苏联人却有权向市苏维埃主席要住房。谁都知道，在我国，住房费用是非常非常之低的。住房费可以说是象征性的。您谈你们的自由谈得很多，可是在这些自由中也有这样一种自由，那就是在桥底下过夜的自由。”
    尼克松副总统转了话题，对赫鲁晓夫说，注意一下洗衣机，在洗衣机生产方面进行竞赛，这要比在火箭生产方面进行竞赛好。
  　赫鲁晓夫同志打趣说：“我竟认不出是尼克松先生了，如果您的想法真像您所说的那样，那么我们就很容易和你们达成协议。不过你们的将军们在叫嚷的是火箭，而不是厨房里的用具，是他们在用火箭威胁我们，是他们在耍威风，说能够把我们从地球上消灭掉。我们当然不会允许任何人这样做的。而对那些想这样干的人，我们要告诉他们，正如我们俄国俗话所说的，给点儿颜色瞧瞧。”
    这个成语把翻译们难住了。
    尼克松先生建议说，“我们下一次再来谈这个问题吧。”
    赫鲁晓夫反对说，“干吗下一次？就现在谈吧。”
    尼克松副总统认为，在国际关系中不应当发号施令和提出最后通牒，因为这样会促使某一方面走向战争。
    赫鲁晓夫回答尼克松先生说，他同意尼克松的看法，但是全部问题在于是谁在实际上发号施令和提出最后通牒。至于说到关于战争的言论，那末这种言论是一个威胁。
    赫鲁晓夫警告说：“但是威胁对我们不起作用，而且永远不会起作用。拿这个来对付我们，你们得不到什么结果。你们有什么，我们也有什么，况且比你们的好些。不过，我们交朋友难道不更好吗？我们愿意同美国和所有其他国家交朋友。所以最好把发号施令和最后通牒的谈论丢开。我们不要去抓死猫的尾巴吧。”
    尼克松说：“我喜欢您所说的话，在我们美国您会是一个很好的演说家。”
    赫鲁晓夫开玩笑说：“我抓住死猫的尾巴是为了使谈话活跃起来。但是我想说的主要死猫是在外国领土上的军事基地，谁主张保持这样的基地，他就是反对和平，谁主张取消它们，他就是拥护和平。我们取消了自己的军事基地，我们大大裁减了自己的武装部队，我们希望消灭战争的严重的遗迹——希望签订对德和约，并且取消西柏林占领制度。如果这一切都做到了，那末和平就能得到保证，我们也不用再去抓死猫的尾巴了。”
    尼克松问赫鲁晓夫是否认为日内瓦会议可能取得成功？
    赫鲁晓夫说：“当然是，因为我们不是白花钱叫外交部长葛罗米柯呆在日内瓦的。葛罗米柯同志是一个好人，我们不久以前奖给他列宁勋章。但是要日内瓦会议取得成功，谈判的所有参加者必须进行合作。是和平还是战争的问题不是一个可以争论和讨论的问题。这样做不会得到好结果。对这一问题只有一个回答——和平。”
    尼克松打趣说：“据说葛罗米柯先生像我。”
    赫鲁晓夫接着回答他说：“只是外表上像罢了。”他接着又转过来谈日内瓦会议问题。他说：“如果你们希望这个会议成功，那就不应该用僵局来吓唬我们。这正同发号施令一样是白费气力的。”
    赫鲁晓夫同厨房设备的解说员，一位上了年纪的美国女人握手。
    他说：“谢谢您，女主人，您给了我们机会在厨房里进行这场辩论”。
    在“标准的”美国房子的出口处，赫鲁晓夫指给尼克松看两个苏联青年人。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“您看，多么棒的雄鹰！有这样的雄鹰，我们政府还用得着怕什么威胁呢。请您更仔细地看看他们吧，他们像奴隶吗？！而你们在美国举行所谓‘被奴役国家周’。这究竟是什么样的奴隶？”
    小伙子们微笑着回答说：“尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇，我们甚至忘记了这个词，忘记了这个词的意义。”
    尼克松也指着那里的两个美国青年说：“难道我们的雄鹰不好吗”？
    赫鲁晓夫说：“那就正应该让他们交朋友。他们可以共同做出多少好事情来！”
