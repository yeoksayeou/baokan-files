Remembering Polish Experts

　　Guangdong Jiangmen Sugarcane Chemical Factory is China's largest, most comprehensively advanced sugarcane utilization factory, equipped with modern technology. This factory is a blossoming flower of Sino-Polish friendship. It is a large-scale joint enterprise built with the assistance of the People's Republic of Poland. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Polish people—the Polish experts—dedicated their diligent labor here for the Chinese people.

　　In order to help our country build this factory well, the Polish government provided us with the newest technological equipment, mobilized the nation's first-class technical force to design and manufacture the complete set of equipment, and sent more than twenty outstanding experts to guide us here. Although the hot southern weather sometimes deprived them of sleep, and the humid climate made them feel unaccustomed, none of this affected the fiery enthusiasm of the Polish expert comrades. Boiler expert Gurowski contracted hepatitis soon after arriving at the factory. After treatment, when his condition improved slightly, he repeatedly requested the doctor, saying, "A lot of work is waiting for me; let me go back to the factory!" Returning to the factory, he forgot the doctor's advice and devoted himself to the arduous work all day long. When we saw that he was too tired and advised him to rest, he comforted others by saying, "I can do a little less work." In reality, he not only did not do less on the construction site but did more.

　　Polish expert Ofshaniowski, who was responsible for our factory's boilers and power engineering, always adhered to the motto of "Rather check it one more time than neglect it even a little," maintaining a system of inspecting the work two or three times a day. For the sake of boiler quality, he did not mind hardship or fatigue, and regardless of the hot weather, he repeatedly crawled into the steam drums, flues, and air ducts for inspection. During boiler installation, he always left work at twelve o'clock at night. Sometimes, thirty minutes after the quitting bell rang, he would emerge from the second furnace chamber and say, "Now let me inspect the third boiler!" When we advised him to inspect it tomorrow, he would smile and say, "No, comrade, aren't the Chinese comrades working hard now!"

　　The Polish expert comrades treated the construction of China's cause as their own, being responsible to the end, ensuring project quality, paying attention to saving raw materials, and emphasizing safe production. They put forward many valuable suggestions during the factory's construction and also adopted many rationalization proposals put forward by our workers and technicians. During the pile driving for the basic construction, in order to accelerate the project's progress, our engineer Chen Wei mentioned the method of cast-in-place piles used in the construction of Guangzhou City. The Guangzhou experiment was successful, but driving cast-in-place piles also had shortcomings, namely that they could not be driven very deep, so the pile-driving project was slow again. After he proposed it, Polish expert Zawilinski pondered it and finally put forward an improved method that also saved a lot of cement.

　　We also often think of the fact that two years ago, we were sent to the Kruszwica sugar factory in Poland to learn from Poland's advanced sugar-making experience. In Poland, we received warm hospitality and selfless assistance in our lives and studies. The factory assigned the best experts as our internship teachers. The Polish teachers and friends enthusiastically showed us the equipment and explained the operations. Afraid that we would not fully understand their explanations, they used hand gestures or operated the equipment in front of us. Engineers and technicians worked tirelessly to explain the technological process, equipment structure, technical conditions, chemical principles, and operating methods, and they went everywhere to find materials for us, personally disassembling many automated and electrified equipment devices to explain to us. Although they themselves had a lot of work, they still took the time to answer our questions. They often said, "We always have time for Chinese comrades; it would be good if you stayed longer, we can give you everything in our heads."

　　In this way, with their selfless help, we gained a lot during the short internship period. Recalling the years we spent together with Polish friends is truly unforgettable! Now, as the people of the People's Republic of Poland celebrate their National Day, our hearts and the hearts of the workers in our factory are flying to the beautiful, heroic city of Warsaw!

    怀念波兰专家
    广东江门甘蔗化工厂干部　徐鸿庆  工人　邬业昭
    广东省江门甘蔗化工厂是我国具有现代化技术装备的、最大的全面综合利用甘蔗的工厂。这个厂是一朵盛开的中波友谊的鲜花。它是波兰人民共和国帮助我国建成的一座大型联合企业。波兰人民优秀的儿女——波兰专家们在这里为中国人民献出了辛勤的劳动。
    波兰政府为了帮助我国建设好这个工厂，为我们提供了最新型的技术设备，调动了全国第一流的技术力量为它设计和制造全套设备，并派了二十多位优秀的专家到这里来指导。尽管南方炎热的天气曾使他们睡眠不足，而潮湿的气候又使他们感到不习惯，可是这些都没有影响到波兰专家同志们的火一样的热情。锅炉专家古洛夫斯基来到工厂不久就患了肝脏炎，经过治疗，病好了一点时，他就一再向医生要求说：“很多工作等着我呢，还是让我回厂去吧！”回到厂里，他就忘记了医生的劝告，整天忙于繁重的工作。当我们看到他太累，劝他休息时，他又用“我可以少做点活”的话来安慰别人，实际上他在工地上不但没有少做，而且还多做了。
    波兰专家奥夫湘洛夫斯基是负责我厂锅炉和动力工程的，他在工作中总是以“宁愿多检查一遍，也绝不要疏忽一点”的格言，使自己保持了每天检查工作二、三次的制度。为了锅炉的质量，他不计较苦和累，不怕天气炎热，一再钻进气鼓里、烟道里和风道里进行检查。在安装锅炉的时候，他总是晚上十二点才下班，有时下班铃响过了三十分钟，他才从第二座炉膛里钻出来，然后说：“现在让我来检查第三座锅炉吧！”当我们劝他明天再检查时，他就笑道：“不，同志，现在中国同志不是都在苦干吗！”
    波兰专家同志们把建设中国的事业当作他们自己的事业一样，负责到底，保证工程质量，注意节约原材料，并且强调安全生产。他们在工厂建设中曾提出了许多宝贵意见，同时也采纳了我们工人和技术人员提出的许多合理化建议。在基本建设打桩的时候，为了加速工程进度，我们的工程师陈伟曾提起广州市建设中用的灌注桩方法，广州试验成功了，可是打灌注桩也有缺点，就是不能打得很深，因此打桩工程又慢了。他提出以后，经过波兰专家查维林斯基的琢磨，终于提出改进办法，还节省了许多水泥。
    还使我们常常想念的是：两年前我们被派到波兰克鲁斯维查糖厂学习波兰先进的制糖经验。在波兰，我们在生活上和学习上都受到了热情的招待和无私的帮助。工厂指定最好的专家们为我们实习的老师。波兰的老师和朋友们，都热情带我们看设备，讲操作。他们怕我们不能全懂他们的讲解，就用手比，或在设备前操作给我们看。工程师、技术员同志更是不辞劳苦地为我们讲解工艺过程，设备构造，技术条件，化学原理以及操作方法等，并到处为我们找资料，亲自拆开许多自动化电气化设备装置给我们讲解。虽然他们本身有许多工作，但还是抽时间为我们解答问题。他们常说：“我们对中国同志永远是有时间的，你们多呆一个时间就好了，我们可以把脑袋里装的全部给你们。”
    就是这样，在他们无私的帮助下，在短短的实习期间，使我们得到了很多收获。回忆我们与波兰友人共同度过的岁月，真是令人难忘！现在当波兰人民共和国人民欢度国庆的时候，我们和我们厂的工人们的心又飞向美丽的英雄的华沙城去了！
