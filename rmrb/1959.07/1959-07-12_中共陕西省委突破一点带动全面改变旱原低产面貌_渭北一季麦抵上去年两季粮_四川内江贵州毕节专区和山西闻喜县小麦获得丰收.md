Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 11th - Wheat and other summer crops have achieved a bumper harvest in the eastern part of the dry plains of northern Shaanxi, with one season exceeding last year's total grain output. This year, in the four people's communes of Pucheng County, Hancheng County, and Dali County in this region, wheat and summer coarse grains accounted for 67% of the total grain crop area for the year, but the total output exceeded last year's total grain output for the summer and autumn seasons by 6.3%. Pucheng County, which had the largest increase in production, saw its average wheat yield per mu more than double last year. Wheat alone, with a planting area accounting for 47% of the county's total grain crop area for the year, had a total output equal to last year's total grain output. Together with summer coarse grains, the total summer grain output exceeded last year's total output by more than 20%.

The eastern part of the dry plains of northern Shaanxi spans hundreds of miles, including the entire Pucheng and Hancheng counties, as well as parts of Dali County and Tongchuan City. Except for a very small number of watered lands and riverlands near the Yellow River and Luo River, the rest are all dry plains, generally ranging from 350 to 1,500 meters above sea level, with wells ten zhang deep, suffering from drought and water shortage. In addition, the land is vast but the population is small, and there is a lack of labor and livestock. In the past, cultivation was extensive, and yields were very low. Since liberation, although yields have been continuously improved, they were still lower than the average yield of the entire Guanzhong region last year, making it a low-yield black spot in Guanzhong. This year, the four people's communes of Pucheng County, Hancheng County, and Dali County in this dry plain area planted a total of more than 2.75 million mu of wheat, accounting for more than 17% of the wheat field area in the entire Guanzhong region. Therefore, the level of wheat yield in this area directly affects the extent of grain production increase in the entire Guanzhong region.

The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has studied these situations several times, choosing Pucheng County, which had a lower yield last year, to break through one point and drive the overall change in the low-yield appearance of the entire dry plain area. As early as after last year's summer harvest, Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, personally convened a meeting of county party secretaries in this area in Pucheng County. Subsequently, at the Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting, he examined the reasons for the low yield in this area and proposed measures to change the low-yield appearance. During wheat sowing, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee also organized inspection teams to help with the work in Pucheng County. When the cadres and masses of Pucheng County demonstrated soaring enthusiasm and made great achievements, Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, personally led an inspection team to the Bafu Production Team of the Xiangcun Management District of the Chengguan People's Commune in Pucheng County, where wheat field management was done well, and convened a county-wide on-site meeting on wheat field management. Soon, the relevant departments of the province convened an on-site meeting on wheat field management in the six counties of eastern Guanzhong in Pucheng County. The wheat bumper harvest movement in Pucheng County and the eastern part of the dry plains of northern Shaanxi then unfolded vigorously.

In the process of reversing the low-yield situation, this region creatively implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, targeting the characteristics of water shortage and extensive cultivation on the dry plains. All localities first focused on deep plowing and moisture conservation, storing as much rainwater as possible in the soil; they also carried ice to moisten the fields, swept snow back to the fields, and used all deep wells for irrigation, increasing the moisture in the land. In terms of fertilizer application, generally more than 10,000 to 20,000 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu, especially increasing the proportion of base fertilizer, which accounted for 70% of the total fertilizer application, while combining deep plowing with the application of base fertilizer. All localities also promoted rational close planting and took measures to prevent frost damage, which is prone to occur in dry plain areas. During the busy seasons of deep plowing, sowing, and summer harvesting, the communes organized labor and livestock cooperation according to the principle of equal value exchange, which played a significant role in overcoming the difficulties of insufficient labor and livestock in the context of large land area, small population, and increased workload of wheat field management. As a result of the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, the wheat on the dry plains of northern Shaanxi achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, and many large areas of high-yield fields emerged.

The wheat bumper harvest has led to increased surplus grain and a significant increase in the income of the masses. This year, the four communes on the dry plains of Dali County produced a total of more than 81.77 million jin of wheat on more than 315,000 mu, nearly 70% more than last year's total wheat output. After retaining sufficient seeds, more than 33 million jin of public surplus grain were put into storage, exceeding the annual public surplus grain task by more than 4.4 million jin in one season. Each commune member was allocated an average of 270 jin of rations, and a considerable amount of wheat was left over as reserve grain. The actual income of commune members increased by 60% compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 11th - Neijiang Special District in Sichuan Province has given full play to the superiority of the people's communes, and this year's wheat has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The average yield per mu of wheat in the nine counties and cities of the entire special district, totaling 2.26 million mu, has increased by more than 60% compared to last year.

Neijiang Special District is located in the Tuojiang River basin and is the most important economic crop area in Sichuan Province, producing cotton, sugarcane, peanuts, and other crops. For a long time, due to the contradiction between economic crops and other large spring crops and wheat, rapeseed, and other small spring crops in terms of fertilizer and labor competition, farmers were unable to balance both, so they always "emphasized large spring crops and neglected small spring crops," and wheat yields were very low. After the realization of communization in the entire district last year, a part of the female labor force was added, and coupled with tool reforms and increased labor efficiency, the labor needed for both economic crops and wheat field management was basically able to be balanced. At the same time, due to the launch of the year-round fertilizer accumulation campaign and the manufacture of local chemical fertilizers, fertilizer supplies have been greatly improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 11th - Bijie Special District, a high-altitude, cold, and impoverished area in northwestern Guizhou Province, saw its 383,387 mu of wheat sown area achieve an average yield per mu that was 1.4 times higher than last year. Although the wheat planting area was slightly reduced compared to last year, the total wheat output increased by more than 56% compared to last year.

The large-scale bumper harvest of wheat in Bijie Special District is due to the serious implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter." Deep plowing was generally carried out to a depth of eight inches to one foot, and 50 to 100 dan of fertilizer were applied per mu, with an average of about 25 jin of seeds sown per mu. A total of 2,361 specialized teams were established in the communes throughout the district to specifically take charge of wheat field management.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 11th - The average yield per mu of wheat in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, totaling 924,000 mu, increased by 40.5% compared to last year. With a slight reduction in planting area, the total output still increased by more than 11% compared to last year. The main reason why Wenxi County was able to achieve a bumper harvest of wheat this year is that all the communes comprehensively and conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase in light of local conditions. More than 90% of the wheat fields in the county were deep-plowed; the amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased by more than double that of last year; and the amount of seeds sown also increased, basically achieving rational close planting. Field management was carried out in a timely manner and with good quality. (Attached photo)

    中共陕西省委突破一点带动全面改变旱原低产面貌
    渭北一季麦抵上去年两季粮
    四川内江贵州毕节专区和山西闻喜县小麦获得丰收
    本报西安11日电　陕西渭北旱原东部地区小麦等夏田丰收，一季超过去年全年的粮食总产量。今年，这个地区的蒲城县、韩城县和大荔县的四个人民公社，共种小麦及夏杂粮占全年粮食作物面积的67％，总产量却超过去年全年夏秋两季粮食的总产量的6.3％。增产幅度最大的蒲城县，今年小麦平均亩产超过去年一倍，单是小麦一项，播种面积占全县全年粮食作物总面积的47％，但总产量就等于去年全年的粮食总产量，连同夏杂粮，夏季粮食总产量超过去年全年总产量20％以上。
    渭北旱原东部地区广阔数百里，包括蒲城、韩城全县以及大荔县和铜川市部分地区，除靠近黄河、洛河有极少数水地和川地外，其余都是旱原，一般海拔三百五十到一千五百公尺以上，井深十丈，干旱缺水。加上地多人少，劳畜力缺乏，过去耕作粗放，产量很低。解放以来，产量虽不断提高，但到去年还低于整个关中地区的平均产量，是关中地区的低产黑锅底。今年，这块旱原地区的蒲城县、韩城县以及大荔县的四个人民公社，共种小麦二百七十五万多亩，占整个关中地区麦田面积17％以上。因此，这个地区小麦产量的高或低，都直接影响整个关中粮食增产幅度。
  中共陕西省委曾经数次研究了这些情况，选择了去年产量较低的蒲城县，突破一点，带动全面，改变整个旱原地区的低产面貌。早在去年夏收后，中共陕西省委第一书记张德生亲自到蒲城县召开了这个地区的县委书记会议，随后又在省委扩大会议上，检查了这个地区低产的原因，提出了改变低产面貌的措施。小麦播种时，省委、省人民委员会又组织检查团到蒲城县帮助工作。当蒲城县干部和群众表现了冲天的干劲而且做出很大成绩时，省委第一书记张德生又亲率检查团，在蒲城县麦田管理工作作得较好的城关人民公社翔村管区八福生产队，召集了全县麦田管理现场会议，不久，省有关部门又在蒲城县召开了关中东部六县的麦田管理现场会议。蒲城县以及渭北旱原东部地区的麦田丰产运动，随即蓬蓬勃勃地展开。
    这个地区在翻低产黑锅底中，针对旱原缺水和耕作粗放的特点，创造性地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”。各地都首先狠狠地抓深翻地和收墒，保墒，把雨水尽量贮藏在壤里；各地还背冰润田，扫雪归田，以及利用所有深井灌溉，增加土地中的水分。在抓肥方面，一般每亩都施肥一万多到二万斤，特别是增加了底肥的比重，底肥占整个施肥量的70％，同时结合深翻地施底肥。各地还推行了合理密植，采取措施以防旱原地区容易发生的霜冻灾害。各公社在深翻地、播种和夏收等紧张季节按等价交换的原则，组织了劳畜力协作，这都对克服在地多人少和麦田管理工作量增加情况下劳畜力不足的困难，起了很大作用。贯彻农业八字宪法的结果，渭北旱原小麦获得了空前丰收，出现了很多大面积丰产田。
    小麦丰收，余粮增多，群众收入大大增加。大荔县旱原上的四个公社今年三十一万五千多亩小麦，总产八千一百七十七万多斤，超过去年小麦总产量近70％。留足了种籽，公余粮入仓三千三百多万斤，一季入仓超过全年公余粮任务四百四十万斤。每个社员平均分配二百七十斤口粮，还余下不少小麦作为储备粮，社员实际收入比去年增加了60％。
    据新华社成都11日电　四川省内江专区充分发挥人民公社的优越性，今年小麦空前大丰收。全专区九个县市的二百二十六万亩小麦，平均亩产量比去年增加六成以上。
    内江专区在沱江流域，是四川省最主要的经济作物区，盛产棉花、甘蔗、花生等。长期以来，由于经济作物等大春作物和小麦、油菜等小春作物存在着争肥、争劳力的矛盾，农民无力两者兼顾，因而一向
  “重大春、轻小春”，小麦产量很低。去年全区实现公社化后，增加了一部分妇女劳动力，再加上工具改革和劳动效率的提高，使经济作物和小麦田间管理需要的劳力都基本能够兼顾。同时又由于开展常年积肥运动和制造土化肥，肥料供应有了很大改善。
    据新华社贵阳11日电　贵州省西北部高寒贫瘠的毕节专区，播种的三十八万三千三百八十七亩小麦，平均亩产量比去年增加一点四倍。小麦播种面积比上年有所减少，但小麦总产量比去年增加56％强。
    毕节专区小麦大面积丰收，由于认真贯彻了“八字宪法”。深耕一般在八寸到一尺，每亩施肥五十担到一百担，平均每亩下种二十五斤左右。全区各公社共成立二千三百六十一个专业队，专门负责小麦田间管理。
    据新华社太原11日电　山西闻喜县九十二万四千亩小麦，平均每亩产量比去年提高40.5％。在播种面积有所减少的情况下，总产量仍比去年增加11％以上。闻喜县今年小麦能够获得大丰收，主要是由于各公社全面认真地因地制宜地贯彻了农业增产“八字宪法”。全县90％以上的麦田实行了深耕；每亩施肥量比上年增加一倍以上；播种量也有所增加，基本上做到了合理密植。田间管理搞得及时，质量良好。（附图片）
