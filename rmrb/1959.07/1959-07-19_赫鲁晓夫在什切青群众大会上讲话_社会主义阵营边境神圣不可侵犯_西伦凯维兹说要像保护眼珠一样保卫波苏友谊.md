Xinhua News Agency, Szczecin, July 17th: According to TASS, the Soviet Party and Government delegation headed by Khrushchev arrived in Szczecin, Poland, a shipbuilding industry center and seaport, on July 17th from Katowice, and was warmly welcomed by local residents.

Khrushchev attended a city-wide mass rally and delivered a speech.

When talking about the great achievements of the Polish people in socialist construction, Khrushchev said that the Soviet people are particularly pleased with these achievements because the Soviet people, the Polish people, and the Polish workers are linked by a long-standing bond of friendship and fraternity.

Khrushchev said that the Polish people are preparing to celebrate the millennium of the Polish state. A thousand years is a thorny road full of struggle and hardship. In many chapters of Polish history, the glorious return of the western territories to Poland is particularly memorable.

Khrushchev said that today we are talking about the lessons of the past because some people are unwilling to consider these lessons, because some politicians in Bonn—and not only in Bonn—are encouraging revanchist propaganda and saying that they do not recognize Poland's western borders and even openly demand to revise the borders. These gentlemen are obviously completely out of touch with reality.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Polish people's right to their western territories, the blood we shed together to liberate these territories, and the great efforts made by the Polish people to revive this region—all of this is sacred and must never be desecrated by anyone.

Khrushchev continued, saying that the western border of the socialist countries is divided along the border of the German Democratic Republic and the border of the Federal Republic of Germany. We regard this border of the German Democratic Republic as our common border, the dividing line between the socialist world and the capitalist world. This border is sacred and inviolable to the member states of the Warsaw Treaty and to every country in the entire socialist camp. We have stated this repeatedly in the past, and we reiterate it once again: we will fight for this border to thwart any enemy who dares to violate it.

Speaking of the international situation, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union hopes to resolve all disputes peacefully, through negotiations rather than war. However, certain groups in the West are doing everything possible to oppose this. They continue to exacerbate international tensions, establish American missile bases on the territories of several countries, step up the armament of West Germany, and prepare to equip West German troops with atomic weapons.

However, Khrushchev emphasized, we believe that the development of the situation will not favor those who are keen on new military adventures. The power and unity of the socialist camp, the efforts of the people of all countries to strive for peace, and the weakening of the imperialist camp are all creating conditions for preventing a new war and guaranteeing peace.

Khrushchev recounted the proposals for establishing nuclear-free and missile-free zones in the Baltic Sea and Scandinavian Peninsula region, in the Balkans and Adriatic Sea region, and in Central Europe. He pointed out that once these proposals are realized, a vast zone of peace will be formed, isolating the armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty member states from each other. This zone of peace will greatly reduce the risk of armed conflict on the European continent.

Khrushchev said, "I simply cannot imagine how people who cherish their national independence and hope that their people will have lasting peace can fail to adopt our extremely humane proposals." It seems that the essence of the matter here is not a lack of understanding, but that they are bent on serving those groups that hope for an escalation of the international situation.

Khrushchev went on to say that as for the aggressive forces of certain countries, their position is completely understandable. They have their own military bases in the Scandinavian countries, including missile bases, which is naturally beneficial to them. But how can this obvious peace proposal be rejected by activists from Denmark, Norway, and other countries that, although not belonging to this region, are related to it? This is something we cannot understand. Because, once a war breaks out in this region, millions of people in these countries will die in the flames of war.

Polish Premier Cyrankiewicz spoke at the rally, expressing a warm welcome to the Soviet Party and Government delegation.

Cyrankiewicz said that the Soviet Union, Poland, and all countries of the socialist camp are waging an unyielding struggle for peace and to eliminate the danger of war.

Cyrankiewicz emphasized that there are still capitalist aggressive forces in the world that strongly influence the policies of certain Western governments, and their aim is to maintain and sharpen tensions in international relations. First and foremost, the Adenauer group in West Germany belongs to this force.

Cyrankiewicz said that the West has repeatedly said that it is precisely within the framework of the Western alliance, within the Atlantic group, that the great-power ambitions of militarist and revanchist forces can best be curbed, but the actual situation has proved exactly the opposite. Now, not only we, but even some of the most conservative groups in Western Europe, believe that Adenauer is the main obstacle to an agreement between East and West.

Speaking of the German question, Cyrankiewicz emphasized that we all demand recognition of the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic. Otherwise, it will not be possible to normalize relations in Europe and consolidate security. The unification of Germany is a matter for the Germans themselves. It can only be achieved through an agreement between the two Germanys. We believe that the establishment and development of the German Democratic Republic is one of the fundamental guarantees of peace in Europe and a historic condition for Poland and the entire German people to resolve their relations once and for all based on the principles of security and good-neighborly cooperation, and based on the unshakable principle of peace.

Cyrankiewicz concluded by saying that the Polish people will protect and strengthen Polish-Soviet friendship and solidarity with the entire socialist camp as if they were protecting the apple of their eye.

### 赫鲁晓夫在什切青群众大会上讲话  社会主义阵营边境神圣不可侵犯  西伦凯维兹说要像保护眼珠一样保卫波苏友谊

    赫鲁晓夫在什切青群众大会上讲话
    社会主义阵营边境神圣不可侵犯
    西伦凯维兹说要像保护眼珠一样保卫波苏友谊
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社什切青讯：以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联党政代表团17日从卡托维兹到达波兰的造船工业中心和海港——什切青访问，受到了当地居民的热情欢迎。
    赫鲁晓夫出席了全市性的群众欢迎大会，并在会上发表了讲话。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到波兰人民社会主义建设的巨大成就时说，苏联人民对于这些成就特别感到高兴，因为苏联人民同波兰人民、同波兰工人是由悠久的友谊和兄弟情谊的纽带连结在一起的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，波兰人民正在筹备庆祝波兰建国一千周年。一千年是一条充满了斗争和艰难的荆棘丛生的道路。在波兰历史的许多篇页中，特别使人想起的是西部地方重归波兰这个光荣的一页。
    赫鲁晓夫说，今天我们谈到过去的教训，是因为有人不愿意考虑这些教训，因为波恩——而且不仅在波恩——有些政治家鼓励复仇主义的宣传，并且说，他们不承认波兰西部的边界，甚至公开要求修改边界。这些先生显然是完全失去了现实感。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，波兰人民对他们的西部领土的权利，我们为了解放这些领土所共同流过的血，以及波兰人民为了复兴这个地区所作的巨大努力——这一切都是神圣的，永远不许任何人来亵渎的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，社会主义国家的西部边界是沿着德意志民主共和国的边境和德意志联邦共和国的边境划分的。我们把德意志民主共和国的这个边境看成是我们共同的边境，是划分社会主义世界和资本主义世界的界线。这个边境对华沙条约的成员国，对于整个社会主义阵营的每一个国家来说是神圣不可侵犯的。我们过去一再声明过，现在再一次重申：我们将为这个边境而战，以挫败任何胆敢侵犯这个边境的敌人。
    在谈到国际局势时，赫鲁晓夫说，苏联希望以和平的方式，通过谈判而不是战争来解决一切争端。但是，西方某些集团千方百计地反对这一点，他们继续加剧国际紧张局势，在若干国家的领土上建立美国火箭基地，加紧武装西德以及准备用原子武器装备西德军队。
    但是，赫鲁晓夫着重说，我们相信，局势的发展不会有利于热衷于新军事冒险的人。社会主义阵营的威力和团结，各国人民为争取和平所作的努力，以及帝国主义阵营的削弱，这一切都在为防止新战争和保障和平创造条件。
    赫鲁晓夫追述了关于在波罗的海和斯堪的纳维亚半岛地区、在巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区，以及在中欧建立无原子无火箭地区的建议。他指出，一旦这些建议实现，就会形成一个广阔的和平地区，这个地区把北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约成员国的武装部队互相隔离。这个和平地区将会大大减轻在欧洲大陆发生武装冲突的危险。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我简直不能设想，珍视本国独立并希望本国人民有持久和平的人们，怎能不采纳我们的极为人道的建议。看来，这里问题的实质不在于不理解，而在于他们一心只想为那些希望国际局势加剧的集团服务。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，至于谈到某些国家的侵略势力，它们的立场是完全可以理解的。他们在斯堪的纳维亚国家有自己的军事基地，其中包括火箭基地，自然对他们有利。但是，这个明显的和平建议怎么会受到丹麦、挪威和其他虽然不属于这个地区、但是却与此有关的国家的活动家的拒绝呢？这是我们无法理解的。因为，在这个地区一旦发生战事，这些国家的千千万万的人们都将在战火中丧命。
    波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹在大会上讲话时表示热烈欢迎苏联党政代表团。
    西伦凯维兹说，苏联、波兰和所有社会主义阵营各国正在为争取和平、争取消除战争危险而进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    西伦凯维兹着重指出，世界上仍然存在着对某些西方国家政府的政策产生强烈影响的资本主义侵略势力，他们的目的是保持国际关系中的紧张局势并使之尖锐化。首先，西德的阿登纳集团就属于这种势力。
    西伦凯维兹说，西方曾经一再说，正是在西方联盟的范围内，在大西洋集团的范围内才能最好地制止军国主义和复仇主义势力的大国主义欲望，但是，实际情况证明恰恰相反。现在已经不仅是我们、而且连西欧的一些最保守的集团也都认为阿登纳是东西方达成协议的主要障碍。
    西伦凯维兹谈到德国问题时着重说，我们大家要求承认德意志民主共和国的主权。否则就不能使欧洲的关系正常化，不能巩固安全。德国的统一是德国人自己的事。只有通过两个德国取得协议的办法才能做到。我们认为，德意志民主共和国的建立和发展，是欧洲和平的基本保证之一，是波兰和全体德国人民根据安全和睦邻合作的原则，根据不可动摇的和平原则一劳永逸地解决他们之间的关系的历史性条件。
    西伦凯维兹最后说，波兰人民将像保护眼珠一样地保护和加强波苏友谊以及同整个社会主义阵营的团结一致。
