"Bamboo City" Famous for its Mats

In summer, many people love to use "Yiyang Bamboo Mats." These water bamboo splint mats are thin and fine, smooth and beautiful, and lying on them is cool and comfortable. It is said that handicraftsmen in Yiyang County have been weaving these exquisite bamboo mats for nearly six hundred years.

Recently, we came to Yiyang City, downstream of the Zi River. This is the famous "Bamboo City." People carry bamboo baskets, sit on bamboo chairs, and sleep on bamboo beds and bamboo mats. Many daily necessities are bamboo products. The most famous place for producing water bamboo mats is called Maozhu Lake, located in the southeast corner of this city.

In the morning, we arrived at Maozhu Lake. Here, mountains and lakes are reflected, and the mountains and fields are full of lush and upright bamboo forests, which are the raw materials for weaving high-grade cool mats - water bamboo. Deep in the bamboo forest, there is an ordinary folk house, which is the Yiyang County Fine Arts and Crafts Cool Mat Factory. The person in charge of the Yiyang County Industrial Bureau who led us to visit said: "This factory now has more than 150 workers and produces more than 600 cool mats per month. The factory buildings were built by the workers themselves, and the total cost of building the factory was only a hundred yuan. It is a banner for running factories diligently and thriftily throughout the county." The red arrow on the factory's leap forward chart is rising in a straight line. It marks that bamboo mat production is increasing exponentially every year. By June 25th this year, the factory had woven more than 60,000 square feet of cool mats (equivalent to more than 2,000 beds), which is equivalent to the production of the entire year last year. A mat is completed by four workshops: splitting bamboo, scraping bamboo, weaving mats, and weaving edges. In these workshops, there are old craftsmen with white beards and young girls. Many people are participating in weaving bamboo mats with their entire families, retaining the flavor of family handicraft industry. The weaving workshop is almost entirely women. They talked and laughed while weaving the mats with their hands non-stop. Bu Taoying, a well-known weaving expert in the factory, a 28-year-old woman, is teaching two girls with long braids to weave pillow mats with twenty-two splints. Factory director Li, who came from a bamboo craftsman background, introduced us to an interesting history of Yiyang bamboo mats. Legend has it that during the reign of Zhu Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty, the Guo, Fan, Xiao, and Shen families moved here from Hubei to weave bamboo mats. At that time, the mat weaving technology was "confidential" and only passed on to sons, not daughters. Later, the Guo and Fan families had no descendants, leaving only the Xiao and Shen families to weave bamboo mats. By the eve of liberation, there were only sixty-four families here weaving bamboo mats, and some advanced crafts were about to be lost. Only two or three old craftsmen could make fine bamboo mats with thirty-two splints, and even fewer could weave patterns and characters. After liberation, the local Party committee led the bamboo mat workers to organize, exchange technical experience, and break the old concept of "private technology." Old craftsmen continue to take apprentices, and new technical forces have been gradually supplemented. Now, there are more than 20 workers in the factory who can weave patterns and characters, making the most exquisite bamboo mats. In 1954, when they first organized, the old craftsman Chen Shaodong and Bu Taoying and other workers worked together to carefully weave a fine bamboo mat with twenty-four splints and sent it to Chairman Mao to report the good news. Later, they woven a fine bamboo mat with the four characters "World Peace" and sent it to the Leipzig International Exposition. This mat was well received by international friends.

Here, there is a fine tradition of paying attention to product quality. Now, the factory implements a product grade piece-rate wage system, and generally promotes the system of inter-process inspection of products. The upstream and downstream, process and process, check each other to ensure product quality. When we visited, Communist Youth League member Shen Guxiang was weaving fine bamboo mats, and her father, Shen Jingfan, was her upstream, helping her scrape fine splints. Shen, who is fifty-nine years old this year, has been doing bamboo mat craftsmanship for fifty years and is a well-known old craftsman here. However, when he scraped fine splints, if a few splints were scraped unevenly by chance, he would have to rework. In this way, one process after another, one link after another, grasping the quality control, ensures that most of the products leaving the factory are of excellent quality.

In the high-quality and high-yield campaign, the factory's employees also collectively created weaving machines and bamboo splitting machines, which increased work efficiency by more than double the original.

In the evening, as we left this beautiful mountain village, the employees played the huqin and sang flower drum tunes, beginning their active cultural and recreational life. A worker gave us a mountain song he composed. This mountain song describes the characteristics of this factory.

The wind blows ten miles of green bamboo leaves,
Made into bamboo mats, beautiful and refined.
The simple old houses have good scenery,
Diligent and thrifty factory is number one.

### “竹城”出名席

    “竹城”出名席
    夏天，许多人都喜爱铺“益阳竹席”。这种水竹篾席子又薄又细，光滑美观，躺在上面凉爽舒适。据说，益阳县手工业工人织这种精巧的竹席已将近有六百年历史了。
    最近，我们来到资江下游的益阳市。这里是有名的“竹城”。人们提的是竹篮，坐的是竹椅，睡的是竹床、竹席。生活日用品许多都是竹器。出产水竹席最有名的地方，叫做茅竹湖，就在这个城市的东南角上。
    早晨，我们来到茅竹湖。这里山湖掩映，遍山遍野都是葱翠挺拔的竹林子，这就是织高级凉席的原料——水竹。在竹林深处，有一所普通的民房，便是益阳县美术工艺凉席厂。领我们参观的益阳县工业局的负责人说：“这个厂子现在有一百五十多名工人，每月生产六百多床凉席。厂房是工人们自己动手盖的，建厂费用总共只花了百把元钱，它是全县勤俭办厂的一面旗帜。”这个厂生产跃进图表上的红色箭头，直线上升。它标志着：竹席生产每年成倍增加。今年到6月25日止，全厂已织了六万多平方尺凉席（折合两千多床），相当于去年一年的产量。一床席子，由破篾、刮篾、织席和织边四个车间来完成。在这些车间里，有白胡子的老艺人，也有年轻的小姑娘。许多人都是全家大小参加织竹席，一直保留着家庭手工业的风味。织席车间里，几乎全是妇女。她们一边谈笑，一边双手不停地织着席子。全厂有名的织席能手、二十八岁的妇女卜桃英正在教两位长辫子姑娘织二十二皮篾的枕头席子。篾工出身的李厂长向我们介绍了益阳竹席的一段有趣的历史。传说，明朝朱洪武的时代，郭、樊、萧、沈四姓人家从湖北搬到这里织竹席。当时织席技术是“保密”的，只传子不传女。后来，郭、樊两姓绝了后代，只剩下萧、沈两姓织竹席。到解放前夕，这里只剩下六十四户人家编竹席，有些高级工艺技术快要失传了。编三十二皮篾的细篾席子，只有两、三个老艺人能动手，能编花织字的人更少。解放以后，当地党委领导竹席工人组织起来，互相交流技术经验，打破了“技术私有”的旧观念。老艺人不断带徒弟，新的技术力量才陆续得到补充。现在，全厂已有二十多名工人能编花织字。做最精巧的竹席子。1954年他们刚组织起来的时候，老艺人谌少冬和卜桃英等工人一起，精心织了一床二十四皮篾的细篾席子送给毛主席报喜。后来，他们又织出有“世界和平”四个大字的细篾席子，送到来比锡国际博览馆。这席子得到了国际友人的好评。
    这里有着重视产品质量的优良传统。现在，厂里实行产品等级计件工资制，普遍推行工序间交接检验产品的制度，上手与下手、工序与工序之间，互相检查，保证产品质量。我们访问时，共青团员沈谷香在织细篾席子，她的父亲沈敬凡是她的上手，帮她刮细篾。沈老汉今年五十九岁，整整做了五十年竹席工艺，是这里有名的老艺人。可是，他在刮细篾时，偶然有几皮篾刮得不匀，他就得返工。就这样一个工序连一个工序、一环套一环地抓住质量关，保证了出厂的产品绝大部分是优级品。
    在优质高产运动中，这个厂的职工们还集体创制了织席机、破篾机，工效比原来提高一倍以上。
    傍晚，当我们离开这个美丽的山村时，职工们拉起胡琴，唱起花鼓调，开始了活跃的文娱生活。一位工人把自己编的一首山歌送给我们。这首山歌写出了这座工厂的特点。
    风吹十里竹叶青，
    制成竹席美又精。
    平房旧舍风光好，
    勤俭办厂第一名。
