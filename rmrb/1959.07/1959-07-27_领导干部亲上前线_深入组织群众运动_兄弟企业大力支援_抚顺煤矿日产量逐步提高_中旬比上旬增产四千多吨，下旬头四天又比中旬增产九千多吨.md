(Our Newspaper Fushun Dispatch, 26th) Leading cadres of the Fushun Mining Bureau and many heads of sections and departments have left their conference rooms and plunged into the forefront of production, vigorously promoting mass movements and disseminating advanced experiences, setting off a new high tide of production. Since July, the output of raw coal in Fushun Coal Mine has been continuously increasing. The average daily output of raw coal in the mine in mid-July was more than 42,000 tons, an increase of 4,500 tons per day compared to early July; the average daily output from the 21st to the 24th reached 51,300 tons, significantly exceeding the average daily production level in mid-July.

The mine achieved great production results in the first half of the year. Compared with the same period last year, raw coal increased by 43.9%; refined coal increased by 45.8%; tunneling footage increased by 68.7%; stripping increased by 33.3%; rock collapse management increased by 25.5%; total output value increased by 51.7%; capital construction increased by 107%; and rock tunneling increased by 132.7%. Percentage increases ranging from tens of percent to several times truly represent a continued Great Leap Forward. Therefore, it was awarded the "High-Yield, High-Quality, Tunneling and Stripping Comprehensive Leap Forward Red Flag" by Liaoning Province and the "Large-Area, High-Yield, Abundant Production Red Flag" at the first national coal mine appraisal conference.

In mid-July, the coal mine combined the transmission and discussion of the instructions from the telephone conference of the Ministry of Coal Industry, mobilizing the masses to speak out freely, post big-character posters, identify problems, and propose measures. At the same time, the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party required the leading cadres of the Mining Bureau and a large number of office cadres to leave their conference rooms and go to the front line of production to focus on weak links, key measures, organize and lead production competition movements, immediately set off a new high tide of production, and assign production tasks to the masses for discussion and to grassroots production units for discussion. Find ways to increase production, tap potential, and propose concrete measures in a production team, a shift, and a coal mining area to boost the enthusiasm of the masses.

Recently, several secretaries and directors of the Mining Bureau Party Committee have been assigned to lead production in various mines, and most of the department- and section-level cadres have also plunged into the forefront of production. The Mining Bureau Party Committee has decided to assign a quarter of the office cadres to production.

When the workers saw some leading cadres taking the lead and organizing a new upsurge in production, they had a clear understanding of the leaders' intentions, saw the leaders' determination, and their enthusiasm greatly increased. The workers put forward the resounding slogan of overfulfilling the production plan for the third quarter to welcome the tenth anniversary of National Day, and put forward a series of reliable guarantees and specific measures to overfulfill the plan. High-yield competitions were also carried out between the mines, and in the high-yield competitions, special attention was paid to promoting effective advanced experiences. In the Xilutian Mine, locomotive stripping on the main line often experienced failures when climbing slopes, affecting production. After vigorously promoting the experience of using extended compression couplers on each locomotive, the number of failures decreased significantly, greatly accelerating the turnaround of locomotives. Because attention was paid to promoting advanced experiences in the competition, the output of raw coal increased day by day. The daily output of the first mining area of ​​the Laohutai Mine was 2,111 tons in early July, and the daily output reached 2,531 tons from the 9th to the 11th, and 2,647 tons from the 13th to the 15th. From the 11th to the 18th, the average daily output of raw coal in the entire mining section of the Xilutian Mine was 10,988 tons, an increase of 47.5% compared with the average daily output from the 1st to the 8th of early July. All aspects of the Shengli Mine have exceeded the work plan. This shows that the production of the entire Mining Bureau is increasing day by day. It can be predicted that as long as the work is done well, the masses are mobilized, and the new upsurge in production is organized, it is entirely possible for the entire Mining Bureau to overfulfill the production plan for the third quarter.

The Fushun Mining Bureau's measures of facing reality and facing the masses, quickly taking action, and organizing a new upsurge in production without losing time, has led to rising production. This is a very important experience.

Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 26th. Various enterprises in Fushun are tapping the potential of materials and production, and are providing a large number of materials and spare parts to support coal production.

In early July, the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee convened a meeting of responsible cadres of enterprises throughout the city, requesting factories to promote the spirit of communist cooperation, clear warehouses, tap potential, and vigorously support coal production. So far, 26 enterprises and units in the city have provided dozens of types of important materials, such as steel, steel ingots, silicon iron, ball bearings, and insulation materials, that are not used or temporarily not used by their own units. Most of these materials are urgently needed for equipment repair and production in the mining area. Among them, the insulation materials provided by various factories to the mining area can basically meet the needs of the mining area; silicon steel sheets, cotton-covered wires, aluminum ingots, etc. can be used for the mining area to repair more than one hundred small equipment.

Various enterprises have shown a high degree of cooperation in supporting coal mine production. No. 3 insulating varnish is an indispensable material for repairing electric locomotives, and the mining area supply personnel have been running around to many places since the beginning of the year without finding a solution. This time, the Fushun Furniture Factory provided three tons, which not only solved the needs of the Fushun mining area, but also can be transferred to support other coal mines. The leaders of the Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant personally took charge, mobilized the masses, tapped the potential of materials, and transferred 10 tons of thin steel plates to support the Laohutai Mine in manufacturing lightweight pipes to ensure that the new mining area was put into production in a timely manner. This factory also supported the mining area with 17 tons of 7 to 9 mm medium-thick steel plates, which can be made into more than 500 mud and sand buckets for loading coal.

In terms of processing and manufacturing equipment parts for coal mines, various factories have also taken emergency measures to meet the production needs of coal mines as much as possible. At present, ten machinery factories in the city have arranged the production tasks of more than 100 tons of coal mine equipment parts, and some of the parts undertaken by the factories have begun to be delivered one after another.

    领导干部亲上前线　深入组织群众运动　兄弟企业大力支援
    抚顺煤矿日产量逐步提高
    中旬比上旬增产四千多吨，下旬头四天又比中旬增产九千多吨
    本报抚顺26日电　抚顺矿务局领导干部和许多处科长级干部走出会议室，投入生产最前线，大搞群众运动，推广先进经验，掀起了生产运动的新高潮。7月以来，抚顺煤矿的原煤产量不断上升。全矿7月中旬的原煤平均日产量为四万二千多吨，比上旬每天增加了四千五百吨；21日到24日的平均日产量达到了五万一千三百吨，又大大超过了中旬的平均日产水平。
    该矿上半年的生产成就是很大的，与去年同期相比，原煤增长43.9％；精煤增长45.8％；掘进进尺提高68.7％；剥离提高33.3％；崩岩整理提高25.5％；生产总值提高51.7％；基本建设增长107％；岩石掘进提高132.7％。百分之几十以至成倍地增长，确实是继续大跃进，因此获得了辽宁省的“高产优质掘进剥离全面跃进红旗”，并获得全国煤矿第一次评比大会的“大面积高额丰产红旗”。
    这个煤矿在7月中旬结合传达和讨论煤炭工业部电话会议的指示，发动群众大鸣大放贴大字报、找问题、提措施，同时，中共抚顺市委要求矿务局的领导干部和大批机关干部走出会议室，到生产第一线，抓薄弱环节，抓关键措施，组织和领导生产竞赛运动，立即掀起生产新高潮，把生产任务交给群众讨论、交给基层生产单位讨论，在一个生产小组，一个班、一个采煤区找增产门路，挖增产潜力，提具体措施，鼓舞群众的积极性。
    最近，矿务局党委的几个书记、几个局长都分工到各矿领导生产、大部分处科级干部也投入生产最前线，矿务局党委决定，叫四分之一的机关干部投入到生产中去。
    职工们看到一些领导干部亲上前线，又组织新的生产高潮，心中对领导上的意图有了底，看到了领导上的决心，积极性大为提高。职工们提出了超额完成第三季度生产计划，迎接国庆十周年的响亮口号，并且提出了超额完成计划的一系列的可靠保证和具体措施。各矿之间还开展了高产竞赛，并在高产竞赛中，特别注意了推广行之有效的先进经验。西露天矿剥离用机车在干线上爬坡常常发生故障影响生产，这次大张旗鼓地在每台机车上推广了引涨压缩车钩经验后，故障显著减少，大大加速了机车周转。由于在竞赛中，同时注意推广了先进经验，原煤产量日日上升。老虎台矿第一采区7月上旬日产二千一百一十一吨，9日到11日日产量就达到二千五百三十一吨，13日到15日又达到二千六百四十七吨。西露天矿采煤段11日到18日全段平均日产原煤为一万零九百八十八吨，比上旬1至8日平均日产量提高了47.5％。胜利矿各方面都超过了作业计划。这表明了整个矿务局的生产一天比一天上升，可以预计，只要作好工作，把群众发动起来，把生产新高潮组织起来，全矿务局超额完成第三季度生产计划是完全可能的。
    抚顺矿务局采取面向实际，面向群众的措施，迅速行动起来，不失时机地组织生产运动新高潮，使生产节节上升。这是一条很重要的经验。
    新华社抚顺26日电　抚顺市各企业挖掘物资潜力和生产潜力，拿出大批材料和备品配件支援煤炭生产。
    中共抚顺市委和市人民委员会7月上旬召开了全市企业负责干部会议，要求各厂发扬共产主义的协作精神，清理仓库，挖掘潜力，大力支援煤炭生产。到目前为止，全市二十六个企业单位，已经拿出本单位用不上或暂时不用的钢材、钢锭、釸铁、滚珠轴承、绝缘材料等重要材料几十种。这些材料绝大部分都是矿区检修设备和生产所急需的物资。其中，各厂支援矿区的绝缘材料基本上能满足矿区需要；矽钢片、纱包线、铝锭等可供矿区检修一百多台小型设备用。
    各企业在支援煤矿生产中表现出高度的协作精神。三号绝缘漆是检修电机车不可缺少的材料，矿区供应人员从年初开始跑了好多地方都没有得到解决。这次抚顺市木器厂拿出了三吨，不仅解决了抚顺矿区的需要，还可以调出支援别的煤矿。抚顺重型机器厂领导亲自挂帅，发动群众，挖掘物资潜力，调剂出十吨薄钢板，支援老虎台矿制造轻便管子，保证新采区及时投入生产。这个工厂还支援了矿区十七吨七到九毫米的中厚钢板，可以制成五百多个装煤用的泥砂斗。
    在为煤矿加工制造设备配件方面，各厂也都采取紧急措施，尽量满足煤矿生产需要。全市十个机械厂目前已经安排了一百多吨煤矿设备配件的制作任务，有些工厂承制的配件开始陆续交货。（附图片）
