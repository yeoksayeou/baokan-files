    Santiago Dispatch: A nationwide movement to protect oil resources is unfolding in Chile, demanding the prevention of handing over oil exploration and exploitation rights to American monopoly capital and domestic private capital.
    It is reported that after the Chilean national oil enterprise announced the discovery of new and rich oil deposits in Magallanes Province last October, American monopoly capital actively colluded with Chilean reactionaries to intensify infiltration activities. The Mining Committee of the Chilean Chamber of Deputies recently passed a bill allowing foreign and domestic private capital to develop oil fields in the four northern provinces of Coquimbo, Atacama, Antofagasta, and Tarapacá. In order to "repay" the United States for a loan of 130 million US dollars to Chile and a loan of 81 million US dollars from the American-controlled "International Monetary Fund," the Chilean government decided to allow a subsidiary of Anaconda to build a foundry and an oil refinery in Mutana. Commenting on the Chilean government's act of ceding oil resources, the Chilean "Century Newspaper" pointed out that this precedent would be used to hand over the national oil company to predatory private and foreign capital, because what foreign monopolists want most is Chilean oil.
    Faced with the growing threat of American capital's intervention in Chilean oil, the Chilean public has launched a movement to protect oil resources. Chile recently established a "National Oil Protection Committee" to lead the people of the whole country in the struggle against American monopoly capital's involvement in Chilean oil. It is reported that residents of all social strata, political parties, trade union organizations, and social groups are participating in this struggle, which is led by the Chilean Communist Party and the Socialist Party, as well as other parties participating in the Popular Action Front. The leadership of the bourgeois Radical Party has also issued instructions to its parliamentarians not to support the Conservative Party member Serrano's proposal to hand over oil exploration and exploitation rights to private hands.

    智利掀起全国性保卫石油运动
    阻止把勘探开采权交美国垄断资本和本国私人资本
    本报讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利正在展开一个全国性的保卫石油资源的运动，要求阻止把石油的勘探权和开采权交美国垄断资本和本国私人资本。
    据报道，智利国家石油企业去年10月宣布麦哲伦省发现了新的丰富石油矿藏以后，美国垄断资本即积极勾结智利反动派，加紧进行渗入活动。智利众议院矿业委员会不久前通过一项法案，允许外国和本国私人资本开发北部科金博、阿塔卡马、安托法加斯和塔拉巴卡四个省的油田。智利政府为了“报答”美国给予智利一亿三千万美元的贷款和美国控制的“国际货币基金组织”给予八千一百万美元的贷款，决定让安那康达一家分公司在木塔那建立一个铸造厂和一个石油精炼厂。智利“世纪报”在评论智利政府这一出让石油资源的行为时指出，这一先例将被利用来把国家石油公司交给掠夺成性的私人资本和外国资本，因为外国垄断资本家最想得到的是智利的石油。
    面对着日益逼近的美国资本插足智利石油的威胁，智利公众展开了保卫石油资源的运动。智利在最近成立了“全国保卫石油委员会”，以领导全国人民反对美国垄断资本染指智利石油的斗争。消息说，参加这一斗争的有各个阶层的居民、政治党派、工会组织和社会团体，领导这一斗争的是智利共产党和社会党及参加人民行动阵线的其他政党。资产阶级政党激进党领导机构也发出指示，要它的议员不支持保守党议员赛兰诺关于把石油勘探权和开采权交给私人手中的建议。
