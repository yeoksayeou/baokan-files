A New Path for Training Apprentices
    Recording the Achievements of Old Worker You Wenxiang in Running a Spare-Time Technical Training Class
    By our reporter Zhang Wei

    Bringing up the Little Soldiers
    Last spring, when all the workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation were constantly creating new records in production and completing plans by leaps and bounds, the electrical engineering group of the automobile team of the mechanical power station of WISCO, could not always complete the electrical repair tasks of the automobiles in time. The attendance rate of the vehicles only reached 40% - 60%, seriously affecting the transportation of the construction site. The automobile drivers were very annoyed by this situation and posted thousands of big-character posters criticizing them for being "backward." The head of this electrical engineering group was You Wenxiang. He was an old worker and a Communist Party member, and he was determined to reverse this "backward" situation. At first, he took everyone to work twelve hours a day, and moved to the workshop to sleep at night, and took turns on duty with the technicians, trying to repair the cars as soon as they arrived. After more than twenty days of hard work, the vehicle attendance rate increased to 70%, but it still could not complete the task. At this time, You Wenxiang was very anxious. He analyzed that the reason for not completing the production task was that among the twenty-odd workers in the group, including himself, there were only four technicians, and the rest were all new apprentices who did not know anything about production. And these people were responsible for the repair and maintenance of the electrical equipment of more than 140 automobiles, as well as the maintenance and repair of AC lines. The technical strength was indeed too weak. He believed that it was impossible without increasing the number of technicians. One night, Dong Xianrui, the Party Committee Secretary of the power station, came to the workshop, and You Wenxiang asked Secretary Dong to increase the number of technicians. But Secretary Dong said: "We are in the midst of the Great Leap Forward across the country, and all factories are short of technicians, aren't they? Where can we find technicians to transfer from? You have few technicians, but many apprentices, that is the potential. Relying on a few generals is not enough, we must quickly bring up the little soldiers."

    Secretary Dong's words suddenly enlightened You Wenxiang, but how could he turn the little soldiers into generals in a short time? He thought that if he relied solely on taking apprentices, one technician could only take two or three at most, and all the technicians in the group could only take twelve, and it would take a long time to train them. This still could not meet the needs of production. He should find a more effective method! At this time, he remembered that during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the troops once seized more than 700 enemy vehicles. Because of the lack of drivers and repair technicians, these vehicles could not be used. Later, the leaders of the troops, in order to solve this problem, set up a short-term training class and mobilized him to teach. As a result, many apprentices were trained in a month. Thinking of this, he asked himself: "Now it is a peaceful environment, and there are more favorable conditions than then, why can't we also run a spare-time technical training class?"

    As soon as this idea entered his mind, he immediately became active. He told the Party Committee Secretary about the idea of running a training class. The Party Committee Secretary was very supportive and asked him to prepare a plan first, and said that he would help solve any difficulties. When the apprentices heard that they were going to run a training class, they all said happily: "Master You is so thoughtful!" "When will it start? We will sign up now." Encouraged by the Party Committee and the masses, You Wenxiang became more confident and drafted a plan for running the training class with the technician Huang Zhixing overnight.

        Overcoming Difficulties and Self-Compiling Teaching Materials
    It was not very smooth for the workers to run their own spare-time technical training class. The difficulties were not in the houses, teaching aids, etc., because their method was that the workshop was the classroom, and the workbench was the desk. What made them feel difficult was the lack of teachers and teaching materials. According to You Wenxiang's opinion, he and three other technicians would serve as teachers, but Zhang Wenqing and Yang Zhiqiang felt that their cultural level and technical level were low (both only Level 4), and resolutely refused to agree. With the help of the Party and Youth League branch secretaries and You Wenxiang, the problem of no teachers was finally solved. But immediately afterwards, they encountered the difficulty of teaching materials. Originally, they thought that they could just go to the education section to get the teaching materials and start classes; who knew that the cars repaired by the electrical engineering group were of dozens of types, and there was no book on the market that could meet the requirements. At this time, You Wenxiang felt a chill in his heart and had no idea what to do. However, thinking of the production tasks and seeing the apprentices' eagerness to learn, he became firm again.

    In this way, You Wenxiang lectured every morning, participated in production during the day, and went to bookstores and libraries to find reference materials at night with his notebook. He successively found seventy-three books related to electrical appliances. In order to make the content of the teaching materials more suitable for production needs and the acceptance level of apprentices, he also constantly solicited the opinions of the students. Therefore, the compiled teaching materials ensured the unity of learning and application. The content of the teaching materials was what they encountered in daily production. For each part of the lecture notes, he adopted the method of moving from the shallow to the deep, writing in simple and easy-to-understand language, and also tried to use diagrams. These lecture notes were mimeographed, and no one in the group knew how to cut stencils, so You Wenxiang took the initiative to take on this work.

    The hot summer came. In the evening, people were sitting outside the door fanning themselves to cool off, but You Wenxiang was still in the hot room, writing non-stop. One day, he got off work at more than eight o'clock in the evening, and after eating, he continued to write lecture notes. His wife persuaded him: "Forget it, it's so hot, you won't be able to stand it if you continue like this!" After his wife left, You Wenxiang fell into deep thought. "What she said is right! The weather is really too hot, I have to discuss it with everyone tomorrow and ask someone else to do it!" He was about to go out to cool off when another thought occupied him. "But, if I push it to someone else, aren't they afraid of the heat? The Party Committee has great hopes for me, can't I overcome this difficulty as a Communist Party member? Besides, how eager are the apprentices to learn technology! Wasn't I also an apprentice?"

    When You Wenxiang was fifteen years old, he worked as an apprentice in the Harbin Transportation Bureau under Japanese control. These masters not only did not teach technology, but only asked the apprentices to do chores, and often beat and scolded people. You Wenxiang learned a little technology by secretly learning. These past events made him feel uncomfortable. Now that he is a master, can he not care about his apprentices? He must teach the technology to his apprentices as soon as possible, and he is not afraid of any difficulties. Immediately, he felt much calmer in his heart. In order to avoid mosquito attacks, he moved a stool and placed it on the bed surrounded by a mosquito net as a table, and he sat on the bed and buried his head in writing teaching materials again.

      You Wenxiang's Experience Blossoms and Bears Fruit
    The spare-time technical training class led by You Wenxiang follows the instructions of the Party Committee and relies on the masses everywhere. He and the teachers Huang Zhixing, Zhang Wenqing, and Yang Zhiqiang formed a teacher group. Before lecturing, they held a "pre-class preparation meeting" to study the key points and methods of lecturing; after class, they held a "post-class symposium" to solicit students' opinions. The content of the courses was arranged so that the combination of theory and practice was closer, and the students quickly applied what they learned to production. Originally, there were sixteen people in the group who did not understand technology, or whose technology was very low. After attending more than 50 hours of classes, fourteen people reached the level of a third-grade technician and were completely able to operate independently. The students Li Ganxiang and Xia Benyao not only can work independently, but also lead two new apprentices and take on the task of repairing the main part of the car, the battery. In the four or five months from the opening to the completion of the spare-time technical training class, more than 50 students all approached or reached the level of a fourth-grade technician, and some students can also do the work of a fifth-grade technician. Because the students' technical skills improved quickly, they were basically able to repair the vehicles as soon as they arrived, which has increased the integrity rate of the vehicles from the original 40%-60% to 88%-90%, ensuring the completion of the WISCO construction site transportation tasks. Now, the second phase of the spare-time technical training class has been open for several months. This phase is divided into three classes: repair specialty class (new apprentices as students), manufacturing specialty class (old students from the first phase), and all-rounder class, which has developed into a combination of technology, politics, and culture.

    The experience of old worker You Wenxiang in running a spare-time technical training class immediately attracted the attention of the WISCO Party Committee and was actively promoted. In the process of promotion, they relied on the old workers. The newly established technical training class further developed from focusing on learning technology to a school that combines politics, technology, and culture, promoting the all-round training of new workers. Several apprentices in the Fifth Company's electrical engineering group learned the theoretical knowledge of a third-grade electrician and also learned arithmetic within two months of study.

    培养徒工的新道路
    记老工人由文祥开办业余技术训练班的成就
    本报记者　张碨
    把小兵带起来
    去年春天，武汉钢铁公司的全体职工，在生产上不断地创造新纪录，成倍地完成计划的时候，武钢机械动力站汽车大队电工组，却总是不能及时完成汽车的电器检修任务，车辆的出勤率只达40％——60％，严重的影响了工地的运输。汽车司机们对这种情形十分恼火，给电工组贴了上千张大字报，批评他们“落后”。这个电工组的组长就是由文祥。他是一个老工人，又是一个共产党员，他下决心要扭转这种“落后”的局面。开始，他白天带着大家工作十二个小时，夜晚搬到车间睡，又和技工轮流值班，尽量做到车子随到随修。这样苦干二十多天之后，车辆出勤率提高到了70％，但仍然不能完成任务。这时由文祥非常焦急，他分析完不成生产任务的原因是，全组二十多名工人中，连自己在内，才只有四名技工，其余全是新进厂的对生产不摸门的徒工，而这些人都担负着一百四十多台汽车电器设备的修理、保养和交流线路的维护、检修任务，技术力量确实太薄弱了。他认为不增加技工是不行的，一天夜晚，动力站党委书记董现锐到车间来，由文祥便要求董书记增加几名技工。可是董书记说：“咱们全国大跃进，各厂不都是缺技工吗？哪里还有技工调来呢？你们技工少，但徒工多，这就是潜力。单靠几个将军不行，必须迅速地把小兵带起来。”
    董书记的话，使由文祥心里突然亮堂起来，但是，怎样才能在短时间内把小兵变成将军呢？他想，如果单靠带徒弟，一个技工最多只能带二、三个，全组的技工也只能带十二个，还不知道要多久才能带出来，这还是不能适应生产的需要。应该找出更有效的方法！这时，他想起抗美援朝的时候，有一次部队缴获了敌人七百余辆汽车，因为缺少开汽车的司机和修车的技术人员，这些汽车无法利用，后来部队的领导上为了解决这个问题，曾经办了一个短期训练班，动员他去教课，结果一个月时间，便培养出不少徒工。想到这里，他问自己：“现在是和平环境，有利条件比那时多，为什么不能也办个业余技术训练班呢？”
    这个念头一钻进他的脑海，立刻使他活跃起来。他把办训练班的想法告诉了党委书记。党委书记很支持，并要他先拟个计划，还说有什么困难一定帮助解决。徒工们听说要办训练班，都高兴地说：“由师傅想的真周到！”“什么时候办呀？我们现在就报名。”受到了党委和群众的鼓舞，由文祥信心更大了，连夜和技工黄知行一起拟出了办训练班的计划。
        克服困难自编教材
    工人们自己办业余技术训练班并不是很顺利的。困难还不在于房子、教具等，因为他们的办法是，车间就是课室，工作台就是课桌。使他们感到困难的问题是没有教员和教材。按由文祥的意见，是由自己和另外三个技工来担任教员，但是，张文清和杨志强觉得自己文化水平和技术水平低（都只四级），坚决不肯答应。经过党、团支部书记和由文祥的帮助，没有教员的问题总算解决了。但紧接着，又遇到教材的困难。原来，他们以为只要到教育科把教材领来就可以上课了；谁知道电工组修的那些汽车有几十种类型，市面上没有一本书能适应要求。这时由文祥听了心里凉了半截，一下没有主意了。但是，一想到生产任务，看到徒工们那种渴望学习的劲头，他又坚定起来了。
    这样，由文祥每天早上讲课，白天参加生产，晚上就拿着笔记本跑书店、图书馆找参考资料。他先后找了七十三本有关电器的书籍。为了使教材内容更适合生产需要和学徒的接受水平，还不断征求学员们的意见。因此，编写的教材，保证了学用一致。教材的内容，就是日常生产上接触到的东西。讲义的各个部分，他都采取由浅入深的办法，写的通俗易懂，还尽量运用了图解。这些讲义都是油印的，组内又没有人会刻写钢板，由文祥就主动地担负了这个工作。
    酷热的夏天来了。晚上，人们都摇着扇子坐在门外乘凉，而由文祥却还在闷热的屋子里，不停地刻写着。一天，晚上八点多钟下班回家，吃过饭后，又继续写讲义了。他爱人劝他：“算了吧，天这么热，这样搞下去会吃不消的！”等到爱人走后，由文祥一人却沉思起来。“她劝我的话也对！天气实在太热了，明天得跟大伙商量商量，叫别人搞吧！”他正准备出去乘凉，另一个思想又占据了他。“可是，推给别人搞，难道别人就不怕热？党委对自己的希望很大，自己是一个共产党员难道就不能克服这点困难？再说学徒学技术的心多么迫切呀！自己不也是学徒出身吗？”
    由文祥十五岁时，便在日本控制下的哈尔滨交通局当学徒。这些师傅不仅不教技术，光叫徒工作勤杂活，还动不动打人骂人。由文祥靠偷偷学技术的办法，才学到了一点技术。这些往事想起来就使他禁不住难受。现在自己当老师傅了，还能不关心徒弟？一定要尽快把技术教给徒弟，什么困难也不怕。顿时，他觉得心里平静了许多。为了不受蚊虫袭击，他搬个凳子放在围着蚊帐的床上当桌子，自己坐在床上，又埋下头写教材了。
      由文祥的经验开花结果
    由文祥领导的这所业余技术训练班，处处都遵循党委的指示，依靠群众。他和教员黄知行、张文清、杨志强一起组成教师小组。讲课前，举行“课前准备会”，研究讲课重点、方法；下课后，又开“课后座谈会”，征求学员意见。在课程内容上经过安排，理论和实际结合更紧密，学员们学了以后，很快应用到生产上。原来组内有十六人不懂技术，或技术很低，经过上课五十多小时后，有十四人达到了三级技工水平，完全能独立操作。学员李干湘和夏本尧不仅能独立工作，还领着两个新来的学徒，担负起汽车上主要部分蓄电池的修理任务。这个业余技术训练班自开办到结业四、五个月的时间内，五十多名学员便全部接近或达到了四级技工的水平，有的学员还能作五级技工的活。由于学员们技术很快提高，基本做到车辆随到随修，已使车辆的完好率由原来的40％—60％提高到88％—90％，保证了武钢工地运输任务的完成。现在，业余技术训练班第二期开课又已几个月了。这一期分为三班：修理专业班（新来的徒工为学员）、制造专业班（第一期的老学员）和多面手班，已发展为技术、政治、文化三结合。
    老工人由文祥开办业余技术训练班的经验，立即引起了武钢党委的重视，并积极地加以推广，在推广中依靠老工人。新建立的技术训练班，进一步由着重学技术，发展成为政治、技术、文化三结合的学校，促进了对新工人的全面培养。五公司电工小组有几名徒工，在两个月的学习时间内，学会了三级电工的理论知识，还学会了算术。（附图片）
