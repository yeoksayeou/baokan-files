Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 27th: The exemplary deed of Gaganova, an advanced young female textile worker in the Soviet Union, in helping the backward catch up with the advanced, has spread throughout the Soviet Union in recent months. From the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, from Siberia to Central Asia, a nationwide upsurge in learning from Gaganova has unfolded across the vast land of the Soviet Union.

Gaganova was originally the captain of an advanced work team at the Vishny Volochyok Cotton Mill in Kalinin Oblast. In September of last year, in order to help backward comrades and seek a common upsurge in production, she voluntarily transferred from her leading advanced work team to a backward work team in the same workshop. Although this would reduce her salary by a quarter, she did not consider personal gains or losses and was determined to help the backward work team improve its technical level, improve labor organization, and help workers treat their work with a sense of ownership, so as to promote the backward work team to an advanced work team. (This newspaper reported on Gaganova's glorious deeds on July 7th.)

Gaganova's lofty communist style and work enthusiasm greatly encouraged every member of this backward work team. Under her leadership, the backward work team quickly leapt to become an advanced work team. Since July, this team has been able to complete at least 118% of the plan every day. The work team originally led by Gaganova, since being led by Semyonova, an advanced female worker whom she specially trained, has maintained the glorious title of advanced work team for more than half a year.

Gaganova was not satisfied with this. In mid-July of this year, she handed over the second work team she led to the original captain to lead, and she was going to work in another backward team.

Gaganova's moving deeds educated all the staff and workers of the Vishny Volochyok Cotton Mill. According to incomplete statistics, more than fifty workers, engineering and technical personnel in this factory learned from her example and went from advanced units to backward workshops or work teams to work. Now, in this factory of more than 8,000 people, no backward work team or backward workshop can be found. With the improvement of labor productivity in the entire factory, the concept of "backward" has also undergone fundamental changes. Now, in the joint factory, only those who complete less than 111% of the plan every day are considered "backward production teams." In the past, there were twenty work teams in the entire factory that did not reach this target, but now there is only one.

Gaganova's creative actions have been valued and commended by the Party and the government. On July 8th, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an order to award Gaganova the title of "Hero of Socialist Labor", and awarded her the "Order of Lenin" and the "Hammer and Sickle" gold medal. Not long ago, the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League and the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions also called on the broad masses of workers and youth to learn from Gaganova's communist style.

At present, the mass movement to learn from Gaganova has spread to all fifteen Soviet Union republics. "There should be no laggards beside advanced producers!" has become the bold statement of working people everywhere in this movement. This movement has not only penetrated into industrial and mining enterprises, state farms, and collective farms, but also into government agencies, schools, shops, canteens, the army, and even nurseries and kindergartens. Party, Communist Youth League organizations, and Soviet organ cadres, heroes of socialist labor, and agricultural experts in many places have gone to the grassroots level to help backward production units work. The upsurge in learning from Gaganova has gradually expanded from individuals to collectives. Now, it can be seen that this mass movement has yielded fruitful results.

Kurbaev, an assistant technician at the Stalinabad Silk Mill in the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, after responding to Gaganova's initiative and transferring to work in a backward production team, quickly gradually increased the labor productivity of this production team. The production team completed 115% of the task in July and overproduced 30 kilograms of raw silk. After a molding foreman from the Moscow Electric Steel Plant went to work in a backward section, he led everyone to adopt advanced operating methods, which quickly increased labor productivity by 50%.

The movement to learn from Gaganova is also blossoming and bearing fruit in the vast countryside. Ivanova, a milkmaid from the Stalin Collective Farm in the suburbs of Kalinin City and a delegate to the 21st Congress of the CPSU, recently proposed to the neighboring "Truth" Collective Farm that she was willing to help this farm's milking farm, which often failed to complete its tasks, to raise four cows on behalf of the farm, so that the milk production of these cows could be increased to the level of milk production of the Stalin Collective Farm. The milkmaids of the "Truth" Collective Farm were deeply moved by this action. People's enthusiasm was sufficient and there were more methods, and the situation of failing to complete tasks all year round was fundamentally reversed. Now, this milking farm has overproduced sixty-seven tons of milk for the country, and the milk production of the cows raised on their behalf by the group led by Ivanova has also doubled compared to the past.

Now, the progress of the movement to learn from Gaganova has far exceeded the scope of helping the backward catch up with the advanced, which was proposed at the beginning of the movement. The concept of "backward" has a new meaning. For example, the female workers of the Kiev Sewing Factory proposed: What if there are no backward units in the factory? After research and discussion, workers, engineering and technical personnel decided that the most advanced production units should go to the poorer production units to help them work, so as to raise all the poorer production teams in the entire factory to the level of the most advanced production teams. Thus, the slogan "There should be no laggards beside advanced producers!" has developed into "Go wherever it is more difficult!" (Attached image)

### “在先进生产者旁边，不应当有落后的人！”  全苏掀起学习加干诺娃的热潮  许多企业消灭落后现象后又去帮助其他单位前进

    “在先进生产者旁边，不应当有落后的人！”
    全苏掀起学习加干诺娃的热潮
    许多企业消灭落后现象后又去帮助其他单位前进
    新华社莫斯科27日电　苏联先进的青年纺织女工加干诺娃的帮助落后赶先进的模范事迹，近几个月来传遍了苏联全国。从波罗的海到太平洋，从西伯利亚到中亚细亚，在苏联广大的土地上，向加干诺娃学习的热潮普遍地展开了。
    加干诺娃原是加里宁州维施涅沃洛茨基棉纺联合工厂的一个先进的工作队的队长。去年9月，为了帮助落后的同志，求得生产的共同高涨，她自愿从她所领导的先进工作队到同车间的一个落后工作队去工作。虽然这样做她的工资要减少四分之一，但是，她并不计较个人得失，决心帮助落后的工作队提高技术水平，改进劳动组织，帮助工人们以主人翁的态度来对待自己的工作，以便把落后工作队提高为先进的工作队。（7月7日本报曾介绍了加干诺娃的光荣事迹）
    加干诺娃这一崇高的共产主义风格和工作热情，大大地鼓舞了这个落后工作队的每一个队员。在她的领导下，落后工作队很快就一跃而为先进的工作队。7月份以来，这个队每天至少能够完成计划的118％。加干诺娃原先领导的那个工作队自从改由她专门培养的先进女工谢苗诺娃领导后，半年多来一直保持先进工作队的光荣称号。
    加干诺娃并不以此为满足，今年7月中旬，她把第二个她所领导的工作队交给原来的队长领导，自己又要到另外一个落后队去工作。
    加干诺娃的动人事迹教育了维施涅沃洛茨基棉纺联合工厂的全体职工。据不完全统计，这个厂有五十多个工人、工程技术人员学习她的榜样，从先进单位到落后车间或工作队去工作。现在，在这个八千多人的工厂中，再也找不到一个落后工作队或落后车间了。随着全厂劳动生产率的提高，“落后”这一概念也起了根本的变化。现在，在联合工厂中每天完成计划低于111％的才算是“落后生产队”，全厂过去有二十个工作队达不到这一指标，而现在只有一个。
    加干诺娃这一创造性的行动，受到了党和政府的重视和表扬。7月8日，苏联最高苏维埃主席团发布命令，授予加干诺娃“社会主义劳动英雄”的称号，奖给她“列宁勋章”、“镰刀和锤子”金质奖章。不久前，苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会和全苏工会中央理事会，也分别号召广大工人和青年学习加干诺娃的共产主义风格。
    目前，学习加干诺娃的群众性运动已经遍及苏联全部十五个加盟共和国。“在先进生产者旁边，不应当有落后的人！”已经成为各地劳动人民在这个运动中的豪言壮语。这一运动不仅深入到工矿企业、国营农场、集体农庄，而且深入到机关、学校、商店、食堂、军队、甚至托儿所和幼儿园。许多地方的党、共青团组织和苏维埃机关的工作人员、社会主义劳动英雄、农业专家纷纷到基层去帮助落后的生产单位工作。学习加干诺娃的热潮，已经逐渐由个人推广到集体。现在，人们可以看到，这一群众性运动已经收到了丰硕的果实。
    塔吉克加盟共和国斯大林纳巴德丝织联合工厂的助理技师库尔巴诺夫，在响应加干诺娃的倡议转入落后生产队工作后，很快就使这个生产队的劳动生产率逐渐提高，生产队7月份的任务完成了115％，并超计划生产了三十公斤生丝。莫斯科电钢工厂的一位制模工长到落后工段去工作后，他带领大家，采用先进操作方法，使劳动生产率很快就提高了50％。
    学习加干诺娃的运动在广大农村中也正在开花结果。加里宁城郊斯大林集体农庄的挤奶员、出席苏共第二十一次代表大会的代表伊万诺娃，不久前向邻近的“真理”集体农庄提出建议，愿意帮助这个农庄的一个经常完不成任务的挤奶场代饲养四头奶牛，使这些奶牛的挤奶量提高到斯大林集体农庄牛奶出奶量的水平。“真理”集体农庄的挤奶员深深地为这一行动所感动，人们的干劲足了，办法多了，常年完不成任务的局面根本扭转了。现在，这个挤奶场已为国家超额生产了六十七吨牛奶，伊万诺娃所领导的小组代她们饲养的奶牛的出奶量，也比过去增加了一倍。
    现在，学习加干诺娃运动的进展，已远远超出运动初期所提出的帮助落后赶先进这一范围了，“落后”的概念又有了新的含义。例如：基辅缝纫工厂的女工们就提出：工厂内没有落后单位怎么办？经过研究讨论以后，工人，工程技术人员决定由最先进的生产单位到较差一些的生产单位去帮助工作，以便把全厂较差一些的生产队一律提高到最先进生产队的水平。于是，“在先进生产者旁边，不应当有落后的人！”这一口号，已经发展成为“那儿较困难就到那儿去！”（附图片）
