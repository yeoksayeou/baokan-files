Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: The Chinese Writing Reform Committee and the Ministry of Culture issued a joint notice on June 29th, promoting the fourth batch of simplified characters. The notice states: The simplified characters in the "Scheme for Simplifying Chinese Characters" promulgated by the State Council were promoted in three batches in 1956 and 1958, totaling 425 characters. Now, another 92 simplified characters have been selected as the fourth batch, starting from July 15th of this year, to be used in Beijing newspapers, magazines, and general books (except for ancient books, etc.). Other provinces and cities should also adopt them as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: A responsible person of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee made the following statement to a reporter from this agency on the issue of promoting simplified characters:

The "Scheme for Simplifying Chinese Characters" promulgated by the State Council in January 1956 includes three parts: the First Table of Simplified Characters, the Second Table of Simplified Characters, and the Table of Simplified Radicals. The State Council's "Resolution on the Promulgation of the Scheme for Simplifying Chinese Characters" stipulated the following regarding the steps for promoting simplified characters: The 230 simplified characters listed in the First Table of Simplified Characters shall be used universally from February 1, 1956; the 285 simplified characters listed in the Second Table of Simplified Characters and the 54 simplified radicals listed in the Table of Simplified Radicals shall be promulgated for trial use first, soliciting opinions from all parties for necessary revisions, and then officially promoted in batches.

According to the State Council's resolution, four batches of simplified characters, totaling 517 characters, have been promoted to date. Except for 28 characters in the Second Table of Simplified Characters that have not been promoted, all the characters in the First and Second Tables of Simplified Characters have been promoted. The remaining 28 characters can continue to be used on a trial basis. The Chinese Writing Reform Committee is currently studying whether to make certain revisions to these 28 characters and some individual characters in the previous batches of simplified characters, based on public opinion.

As for the Table of Simplified Radicals, in addition to the 30 radical-derived characters promoted in the first batch on February 1, 1956, the fourth batch of simplified characters stipulates: "The simplified radicals in the 'Scheme for Simplifying Chinese Characters' have been commonly used in handwriting, mimeographing, and offset printing for a long time. In letterpress publications, they will be promoted gradually according to the situation of type mold engraving and will no longer be announced in batches." This is because the promotion of simplified characters in letterpress printing requires the engraving of type molds first. Engraving all the radical-derived simplified characters into various styles and sizes of type molds takes a considerable amount of time, so it can only be promoted gradually according to the type mold engraving situation. This may lead to a situation where, in a sentence, of two characters with the "言" (speech) radical, one is simplified and the other is not. This situation will be difficult to avoid in the future for a certain period of time. Even if all the commonly used characters with the "言" radical are simplified, there will definitely be very uncommon characters with the "言" radical that are not simplified. However, this situation does not hinder the reader's understanding. Because most people are familiar with these simplified radicals, and they have long been in use in lower-grade primary school Chinese textbooks, some literacy textbooks, general writing, mimeographing, and offset printing. Those who are not familiar with these simplified radicals can quickly grasp them by comparing them with the traditional radicals, and there will be no difficulties.

The promotion of simplified characters has reduced the difficulty for the broad masses—especially children and workers and peasants—in learning and using Chinese characters, and therefore has been warmly welcomed by them. Currently, the masses in various places have also created many new simplified characters, indicating that the broad masses urgently demand the simplification of more characters. In the next stage of work on Chinese character simplification, in addition to revising the "Scheme for Simplifying Chinese Characters" as soon as possible based on usage and public opinion, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee plans to propose a new batch of simplified characters, solicit opinions from all parties, and then consider gradually introducing and promoting them in batches to meet the urgent needs of the masses.

    推行第四批简化汉字
    文字改革委员会负责人就此发表谈话
    新华社14日讯　中国文字改革委员会、文化部6月29日发出联合通知，推行第四批简化字。通知说：国务院公布的汉字简化方案中的简化字，已于1956年和1958年先后三批推行了共计四百二十五个字。现在再选定九十二个简化字，作为第四批，自本年7月15日起在北京市各报纸杂志一般书籍上开始采用（古籍等例外），其他省市也应尽早采用。
    新华社14日讯　中国文字改革委员会负责人就推行简化字问题向本社记者发表谈话如下：
    1956年1月国务院公布的“汉字简化方案”包含三个部分，即汉字简化第一表、汉字简化第二表和汉字偏旁简化表。国务院“关于公布汉字简化方案的决议”中关于简化字的推行步骤作了这样的规定：汉字简化第一表所列二百三十个简化字，于1956年2月1日起一律通用；汉字简化第二表所列二百八十五个简化字和汉字偏旁简化表所列五十四个简化偏旁，先行公布试用，征求各方意见，以便作某些必要的修正，然后正式分批推行。
    根据国务院的决议，到目前为止已经推行了四批简化字，合计五百一十七字，除了汉字简化第二表中还有二十八个字没有推行以外，汉字简化第一、第二两表中所有的字已经全部推行。剩下的二十八个字仍可继续试用。这二十八个字以及前几批已经推行的简化字中的一些个别的字，要不要作某些修正，中国文字改革委员会正根据群众意见进行研究。
    至于汉字偏旁简化表，除了1956年2月1日第一批推行时已经推行了三十个偏旁类推字以外，第四批推行的简化字表作了这样的规定：“汉字简化方案中的简化偏旁，在手写、油印、胶印上通用已久，在铅印的出版物上，将根据字模刻制情况，陆续推行，不再分批公布。”这是因为在铅印上推行简化字，必须首先刻制字模，要把所有偏旁简化字刻制成各种体式、各号大小的字模，需要一个相当的时间，因此只能根据字模刻制情况，陆续推行。这样就可能发生这种情况：在一句句子中，有两个“言”旁的字，其中一个简化了，一个没有简化。这种情况在今后一定时期内还很难避免。即使把所有常用的
  “言”旁字都简化了，一定还会出现非常用的“言”旁字没有简化。但是这种情况对于读者的理解并无妨碍。因为这些简化偏旁，多数人都是熟悉的，而且在低年级小学语文课本上，在一部分扫盲课本上，在一般书写上，在油印，胶印上早已通行。不熟悉这些简化偏旁的人，只要跟繁体偏旁对照，就能很快掌握，不会有什么困难。
    简化字的推行，减轻了广大群众——特别是儿童和工农群众学习和使用汉字的困难，因此受到他们的热烈欢迎。目前各地群众还创造了许多新的简字，说明广大群众迫切要求简化更多的字。中国文字改革委员会在汉字简化方面的下一阶段工作，除了根据使用情况和群众意见把汉字简化方案早日修订以外，准备提出一批新的简化字，征求各方面意见，然后考虑陆续分批试用和推行，以适应群众的迫切需要。
