Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 3rd: Shanghai has achieved significant results in carrying out a mass movement to conserve coal, electricity, and fuel oil. According to statistics from relevant departments, the city has saved 200,000 tons of coal, 70 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, and more than 21,000 tons of oil in the first half of the year. With the rapid development of Shanghai's industrial production, the demand for power fuels such as coal, electricity, and oil has surged. It is estimated that the demand for coal this year will increase by about 60% compared to last year. As early as the first quarter of this year, relevant departments proposed targets for saving coal, electricity, and fuel oil. Various industrial systems also held special meetings successively to deploy conservation work and exchange relevant experiences. More than 6,000 factories in the city widely mobilized the masses of workers to investigate waste, plug loopholes, find key points, and formulate measures to carry out the conservation movement. Many factories have also included saving coal, electricity, and oil as important content of the factory's red flag competition, setting off a surge of learning from advanced units and catching up with advanced units.

Workers are saving in all aspects, from establishing rules and regulations, carrying out technological innovation, strengthening equipment maintenance, improving operation methods, and finding substitutes. The printing and dyeing industry, which uses 500,000 tons of coal annually, has restored and established systems such as announcing coal consumption, setting temperature and humidity, and setting steam pressure, and has promoted advanced experiences such as making full use of steam, reducing coal consumption. The textile industry, which uses millions of tons of coal every year, mobilized the masses to conduct a surprise inspection of boilers and steam pipes, clearing the accumulated scale inside and reducing air and heat leakage, which also saved a lot of coal. Thanks to the continuous improvement of operations by tens of thousands of stokers and kitchen workers throughout the city, and the promotion of the "less, quick, diligent, and even" method of adding coal, a large amount of coal has also been directly saved. Residents who use coal briquettes for cooking are also carefully calculating to save coal briquettes. Recently, with the assistance of various coal briquette stores, they have widely adopted Beijing honeycomb stoves, which are easy to use and consume less coal. Since the beginning of the year, employees of the Shanghai Power Supply Company have strengthened circuit maintenance, reducing more than 30 million kilowatt-hours of power loss in the past six months.

The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Transportation is the unit with the largest fuel oil consumption in the city. In the first half of the year, employees carried out a fuel-saving movement, ensuring that every venue had measures and every vehicle had indicators. The flameout gliding method for saving gasoline has been widely promoted among automobile drivers throughout the city. They have also successfully tested the use of biogas, liquefied petroleum gas, coke oven gas, and power benzene to replace gasoline in automobiles. The biogas car successfully modified by the No. 2 Automobile Field of the Municipal Public Transport Company has been officially running on some routes.

In order to further promote the conservation movement on the basis of ensuring high quality, high yield, and safety, the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Production Committee and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened the Shanghai Municipal Conference of Activists for Saving Coal Coke and Electricity on June 27. Fourteen units, including the Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant, presented a competition proposal at the meeting to all factories, enterprises, and schools in the city to save coal coke and electricity. In the past few days, inter-factory and same-occupation competitions have been launched in factories, enterprises, and institutions throughout the city.

    人人动手节约煤电油
    上海市上半年节约二十万吨煤，七千万度电，二万多吨石油
    新华社上海3日电　上海市开展节约煤、电和燃料油的群众性运动，取得很大成绩。据有关部门统计，全市上半年已节约了二十万吨煤、七千万度电和二万一千多吨石油。随着上海工业生产的急剧发展，煤、电和石油等动力燃料需要量激增，估计今年煤的需要量将比去年增加60％左右。早在今年第一季度，有关部门就提出了节约用煤、用电和燃料油的指标，各工业系统也先后召开了专门会议，布置节约工作和交流有关节约的经验。全市六千余家工厂广泛发动职工群众查浪费、堵漏洞、找关键、订措施，开展节约运动。许多工厂还把节约煤、电、石油列为厂内红旗竞赛的重要内容，掀起了学先进、赶先进的热潮。
    职工们从建立规章制度、进行技术革新、加强设备维修、改进操作方法、寻找代用品等各个方面进行节约。全年用煤五十万吨的印染工业，恢复和建立了公布耗煤量、定温度湿度、定蒸汽压力等制度，并推广了充分利用蒸汽等先进经验，使煤耗量减少。每年用煤达百万吨的纺织工业，发动群众对锅炉、蒸汽管道进行了一次突击检修，清除了里边积存的水锈，减少了漏气、漏热等现象，也节约了许多煤炭。由于全市几万名司炉和食堂司灶的工人不断改进操作，推广“少、快、勤、匀”的加煤方法，也直接节约了大量煤炭。使用煤球烧饭的居民，也精打细算节省煤球，最近他们还在各煤球店的协助下广泛采用了使用方便、耗煤量少的北京蜂窝炉。上海市供电公司的职工从年初起就加强了电路维修的工作，半年来，一共减少了三千多万度的电力损失。
    上海市交通运输局是全市燃料油用量最大的单位，上半年职工们开展了节油运动，做到了场场有措施、车车有指标。在全市汽车司机中节省汽油的熄火滑行法已经得到广泛推行。他们还试验成功用沼气、液态烃、焦化气和动力苯等多种燃料代替汽油开汽车。市公共交通公司汽车二场改装成功的沼气汽车，已经在一些线路上正式行驶。
    为了在保证优质高产安全的基础上进一步开展节约运动，上海市工业生产委员会和市工会联合会于6月27日联合召开了全市节煤焦、节电活动分子大会。上海第二钢铁厂等十四个单位，在会上向全市各工厂、企业、学校提出了节约用煤用焦、用电的竞赛倡议书。这几天，全市工厂企业和事业单位的厂际同工种竞赛已经展开。
