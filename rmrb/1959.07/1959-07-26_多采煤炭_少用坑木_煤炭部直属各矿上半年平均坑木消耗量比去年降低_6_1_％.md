To mine more coal and use less pit props, the coal industry departments, while carrying out the mass red flag emulation drive for high-yield, are closely grasping the conservation of pit props. The broad masses of workers are actively finding ways to reduce the consumption of pit props while ensuring high production and production safety. On the basis of reducing the consumption of pit props per thousand tons of coal by 9.6% last year compared to 1957, in the first half of this year, the coal mines directly under the Ministry of Coal Industry further reduced it by 6.1% compared to last year (the consumption of pit props per thousand tons of coal was 19.46 cubic meters in 1958, and 18.28 cubic meters in the first half of this year), saving a total of more than 58,400 cubic meters of pit props for the country. Among the thirteen mining bureaus that won the red flag for large-scale high yield, nine mining bureaus reduced their pit prop consumption compared to 1958, of which the Jingxi Mining Bureau reduced it by 24.6% compared to 1958.

Many coal mines have strengthened the recycling and utilization of pit props. The Fourth Mining Area of Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine, due to its outstanding work in recycling and reusing pit props, achieved a pit prop recovery rate of over 90% and a reuse rate of 60% as early as February, with the daily return of old materials increasing from 20 cubic meters to 60 cubic meters. From January to April, the Xinmi mines in Henan recovered more than 1,300 cubic meters of pit props, and concentrated all the scattered waste materials underground for resawing, and put them into production and use at any time. The workers of Jingxi, Fengfeng and other mines have also actively researched and improved the recovery methods, avoiding losses such as the breaking of pit props under the condition of large top plate pressure in the working face, and improving the recovery rate.

Many coal mines have also made significant improvements in pit prop management, establishing a clearing and inspection system to prevent pit prop backlog; sawing materials are carefully calculated and used according to the materials, and sawing is carried out according to the specifications required underground, reducing and avoiding the loss and waste of wood; large-diameter pit props are resawed under the premise of ensuring safety. For example, the Jingxi mines cut pit props that are 22 to 24 centimeters thick in half from the middle; and those that are 20 centimeters thick are sawn off an inch of board on both sides before being used as pit props. This not only saves wood, but also reduces the burden on workers transporting pit props.

In addition, many mines have also improved the coal mining methods and roadway layout, improved the form of supports, or used substitutes, which have also played a great role in saving pit props.

    多采煤炭　少用坑木
    煤炭部直属各矿上半年平均坑木消耗量比去年降低6.1％
    本报讯　煤炭工业部门在开展大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动的同时，抓紧节约坑木。广大职工在保证高产和生产安全的条件下，积极设法降低坑木消耗量。在去年每千吨煤坑木消耗比1957年降低9.6％的基础上，今年上半年，煤炭工业部直属煤矿又比去年降低了6.1％（1958年每千吨煤坑木消耗为十九点四六立方米，今年上半年为十八点二八立方米），共为国家节约坑木五万八千四百多立方米。在获得大面积丰产红旗的十三个矿务局中，有九个矿务局的坑木消耗量比1958年降低，其中京西矿务局比1958年降低了24.6％。
    许多煤矿都加强了坑木的回收利用。唐家庄煤矿第四采煤区由于突出地抓了坑木回收复用工作，坑木回收率早在2月份就达到90％以上，复用率达到60％，每天退回的旧料由过去二十立方米增加到六十立方米。河南新密各矿1月至4月份回收坑木一千三百多立方米，并将井下零星废料全部集中进行改锯，随时投入生产使用。京西、峰峰等矿职工还积极研究改进了回收方法，在掌子面顶板压力很大的情况下，避免坑木拉断等损失，提高了回收率。
    许多煤矿在坑木管理方面也有了显著改进，建立了清底和检查制度，防止坑木积压；锯料做到精打细算，量材使用，按井下需要规格下锯，减少和避免木材的损失浪费；大径坑木在保证安全的情况下进行改锯。如京西各矿把二十二至二十四公分粗的坑木从中间破成两片；二十公分的将两边锯下一块寸板后再作坑木使用。这样既节省了木材，又减轻了搬运坑木工人的负担。
    另外，许多矿还改进了采煤方法和巷道部署，改进了支架形式，或者使用代用品，对节约坑木也起了很大作用。
