Mongolia is accelerating its pace of socialist construction and moving forward.

The revised Mongolian 1958-1960 Three-Year Plan for the Development of National Economy and Culture, recently discussed by the Third Plenary Session of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee and approved by the Great People's Hural, is a plan to accelerate the speed of socialist construction. The implementation of this plan will establish a more solid material foundation for the development of Mongolia's socialist construction and the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards.

Mongolia's Three-Year Plan was discussed and approved by the Party's 13th Congress in March 1958. The development situation in 1958 showed that the original Three-Year Plan could no longer meet the needs of the developing situation and needed to be supplemented and revised accordingly.

Responding to the Party's call, the Mongolian people achieved brilliant achievements in socialist construction in 1958. First of all, rapid progress was made in the socialist transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry. When the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party held its 13th Congress last year, only 35% of agricultural and herding households had joined cooperatives. By the end of last year, the number of agricultural and herding households joining cooperatives had reached 75%. In March of this year, the Party's Third Plenary Session announced that the number of agricultural and herding households joining cooperatives had reached 96%, and the work of socialist cooperativization of agriculture and animal husbandry in Mongolia had been basically realized. This means that the target set in the original Three-Year Plan to have most agricultural and herding households join cooperatives by 1960 has been completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

With the victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry, Mongolia's national economy has become a socialist economy based on two forms of socialist ownership: ownership by the whole people and collective ownership. The alliance of workers and herdsmen led by the working class has become more consolidated. Now, many small cooperatives have been merged into large cooperatives, which has created more favorable conditions for preventing natural disasters, reducing livestock disease mortality, and adopting scientific breeding management.

While basic cooperativization has been realized throughout the country, administrative organizations have also undergone changes. The administrative organs of Baga (townships) have been abolished, and the integration of Sums (counties) and cooperatives has been implemented. This is not only conducive to streamlining institutions, simplifying administrative procedures, improving work efficiency, and saving expenses, but more importantly, it brings administrative leadership closer to economic work and strengthens leadership over production; it is also of great significance for consolidating cooperatives and developing production.

Significant achievements were also made on various production fronts in 1958. The total number of livestock in the country increased by more than 100,000 head compared with 1957, the agricultural sown area increased by 30.4%, and industrial production overfulfilled the annual plan by 3.8%. In this year, newly built brick and tile factories, glass factories, flour mills, confectionery factories, etc. have been put into production one after another. These changes and achievements, coupled with the development and changes in the socialist camp countries led by the Soviet Union over the past year, require that the Three-Year Plan be amended and supplemented to some extent.

The revised Three-Year Plan is an inspiring plan. The basic task of the plan is to further develop all sectors of the national economy and continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of the people on the basis of new development of Mongolia's productive forces and comprehensive development and consolidation of the socialist components of agriculture and animal husbandry. Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, pointed out in his report to the Third Plenary Session: "The urgent task facing us is to rapidly improve the level of development of our country's productive forces, promote economic and cultural development, and rapidly raise it to the level of the latest achievements of the entire socialist camp." The revised Three-Year Plan runs through this spirit.

Under the circumstances of the victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry, the main tasks in animal husbandry are to consolidate cooperatives, vigorously develop animal husbandry production, increase the number of livestock, and increase the output of livestock products. The plan stipulates that by 1960, the total number of livestock in the country will increase by 7.2% compared with 1957.

The Mongolian government has taken many measures to consolidate agricultural and herding cooperatives. Not long ago, the central government transferred a group of cadres to participate in production management in cooperatives, which will play a good role in consolidating cooperatives. In terms of developing animal husbandry production, while increasing the number of livestock, it is also necessary to improve the quality of livestock. The plan stipulates that artificial insemination will be carried out on more than 3 million head of livestock within three years to improve breeds. It also stipulates indicators for increasing the yield of livestock products such as milk, wool, and fur. To this end, it is necessary to improve livestock feeding management, expand feed bases, and improve veterinary work.

Massively reclaiming wasteland, vigorously developing agricultural production, and drastically increasing agricultural products are one of the important new contents of the revised Three-Year Plan. This is an important measure to solve the domestic flour needs, establish a solid feed base for animal husbandry production, and settle herdsmen.

The Mongolian Party and government proposed that by 1961, the country's wheat production will reach 90,000 to 100,000 tons. This means that the harvested wheat is enough to meet the flour needs of the people across the country, turning Mongolia from a grain-consuming country into a country that produces and processes grain.

The plan stipulates that by 1960, the country's sown area will reach 257,200 hectares, an increase of more than 50,000 hectares over the original plan and an increase of more than 170,000 hectares over 1957. To this end, Mongolia decided to massively reclaim wasteland starting this year. This year's wasteland reclamation task is 120,000 hectares, and it has been decided to build four state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms mainly engaged in agricultural production in areas with good soil and convenient water sources. Mongolia has received strong assistance from the Soviet Union in its work of reclaiming wasteland and developing agricultural production. According to the agreement signed in Moscow in February this year by the delegation of the Mongolian and Soviet governments, the Soviet Union will supply Mongolia with 550 tractors, 350 combine harvesters, and other machines, and send 300 agricultural technicians to Mongolia to help with wasteland reclamation.

In the past, Mongolia's agricultural production mainly relied on state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms. The Three-Year Plan requires agricultural and herding cooperatives to gradually increase the cultivated area, requiring cooperatives to plant grains, vegetables, and feed. This year, cooperatives have sown more than 26,000 hectares of land, an increase of 43% over last year. The further development of agriculture by cooperatives will greatly help the development of animal husbandry and will help to gradually change the face of pastoral areas.

Agricultural machinery will increase with the development of agricultural production. By 1960, the number of tractors in the country will increase to 5.2 times that of 1957, and the sowing and harvesting of grains will be mechanized. Farmland water conservancy work should also be actively carried out. The Kharakhorin and other two agricultural and pastoral farms will complete the water conservancy irrigation project for 11,000 hectares of farmland; on the other hand, in order to irrigate pastures, wells with a total length of 10,000 meters will be dug and repaired.

In terms of industry, the original plan stipulated that by 1960, the total industrial output value would increase by 52% compared with 1957. The revised Three-Year Plan increases the total industrial output value by 53.2%. This is due to the addition of some factory projects, and some newly built factories will be put into production ahead of schedule. For example, in order to meet the flour needs of the people across the country, the number of flour mills to be built has increased; in order to accelerate residential construction, a prefabricated housing factory that can assemble 70,000 square meters of housing annually will be newly built. In the three years, industrial products have increased to varying degrees. For example, coal production will increase from 407,000 tons in 1957 to 790,000 tons, electricity from 58.4 million kilowatt-hours to 70.4 million kilowatt-hours, bricks from more than 40 million pieces to more than 80 million pieces, and leather processing from more than 120,000 pieces to more than 190,000 pieces. In the three years, newly built factories include flour mills, wool textile mills, dairy processing plants, paper mills, thermal power plants, etc., which will produce brand-new products such as flour, paper, and wool textiles. The construction of these factories has been assisted by fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and China.

In the three years, the handicraft cooperative sector will increase the production of daily necessities for the people on the basis of utilizing local raw materials.

Due to the comprehensive development of socialist construction, the state's investment in capital construction has also increased. The revised capital construction investment has reached 895 million Tugriks (Mongolian currency), an increase of 195 million Tugriks over the original plan, an increase of 3.4 times over the investment in the first five-year plan, and 49.5% more than the investment in the second five-year plan. If the material and technical assistance and financial assistance from the Soviet Union, China and other fraternal countries are included, the total amount of Mongolia's capital construction investment in the three years will reach 1.3 billion Tugriks.

In the three years, Mongolia's cultural and educational undertakings will be further developed. The people's material and cultural living standards will also be further improved. Seven-year education will be gradually implemented in larger cities and residential areas. By 1960, the number of students in ordinary schools will increase by 8.8% compared with 1957, and the number of students in colleges and universities will increase by 31.5%. In order to meet the cultural life needs of the people, the number of cultural palaces and clubs will be expanded and increased in various provinces. Health care will also be greatly developed. In the three years, in order to meet the needs of socialist construction, the number of employees will increase by approximately 10.4%, and the total wages of employees will increase by 18%. During the same period, the cash income of cooperative members will increase by 40%. As a result of the increase in people's purchasing power, the commodity circulation in the three years will reach 850 million Tugriks, an increase of 31% compared with 1957.

The revised Three-Year Plan is completely in line with the wishes and vital interests of the Mongolian people and has been warmly supported by the Mongolian people. After the plan was announced, herdsmen and workers in factories and mines across the country expressed their determination to use practical actions to complete the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. Recently, the plenary sessions of the provincial committees of the Mongolian Party, when discussing the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session and the Three-Year Plan, put forward many measures to complete the plan ahead of schedule. For several months, the working people have been working hard with full confidence for the successful completion of the plan, and a vigorous socialist production competition has been launched in factories and pastoral areas. Many factories and mining enterprises have overfulfilled the production plan for the first quarter. The spring plowing and sowing work in agriculture has also been carried out smoothly. By mid-June, 140,000 hectares of land had been sown, an increase of more than 30,000 hectares over last year. A bumper harvest of young livestock has been obtained this year. According to statistics in mid-June, more than 6.4 million lambs have been born, with a survival rate of 95%, exceeding previous years. Now, the working people are starting the tense labor of production and construction in the second half of the year to welcome the 38th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution.

    蒙古加速社会主义建设的三年计划
    玉书
    蒙古人民共和国正在加速社会主义建设的步伐，向前迈进。
    不久前，由蒙古人民革命党三中全会讨论，并经大人民呼拉尔通过的修订的蒙古1958—1960年发展国民经济和文化的三年计划，是一个加快社会主义建设速度的计划。这个计划的实现，将为蒙古社会主义建设事业的发展和人民物质文化生活水平的提高，建立更加巩固的物质基础。
    蒙古的三年计划是1958年3月党的第十三次代表大会讨论通过的。1958年的发展情况表明，原订的三年计划已不能适应形势发展的需要了，必需作相应的补充和修改。
    蒙古人民响应党的号召，1958年在社会主义建设中取得了光辉的成就。首先，在农牧业的社会主义改造方面快速地前进。去年，蒙古人民革命党举行第十三次代表大会的时候，全国只有35％的农牧户加入合作社，到去年年底，加入合作社的农牧户达到75％；今年3月，党的三中全会宣布，入社农牧户达到96％，蒙古的农牧业社会主义合作化的工作已基本实现。这就是说，原三年计划规定到1960年使大部分农牧户入社的指标已提前和超额完成了。
    随着农牧业社会主义改造的胜利，使得蒙古的国民经济成为以社会主义所有制的两种形式——全民所有制和集体所有制为基础的社会主义经济了，以工人阶级为领导的工人、牧民的联盟更加巩固了。现在，许多小社已经合并为大社，这对防止自然灾害，减少牲畜疾病死亡，采用科学的饲养管理方面创造了更有利的条件。
    在全国基本实现合作化的同时，行政组织也发生了变化，撤消了巴戈（乡）的行政机构，实行苏木（县）和合作社合一。这样，不但有利于精简机构，简化行政手续，提高工作效率，节约开支，更重要的是使行政领导接近经济工作，加强对生产的领导；而且对巩固合作社和发展生产有很大意义。
    1958年在各个生产战线上也取得了显著成就。全国牲畜比1957年增加了十万多头，农业播种面积增加了30.4％，工业生产超额3.8％完成了年度的计划。这一年，新建的砖瓦厂、玻璃厂、面粉厂、糖果点心厂等都已先后投入生产。这些变化和成就，加上以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国一年来的发展和变化，这种客观的形势要求对三年计划作某些修改补充。
    修订后的三年计划是一个鼓舞人心的计划。计划的基本任务是：在使蒙古的生产力得到新的发展，在全面发展和巩固农牧业的社会主义成分基础上，进一步发展国民经济的各个部门，不断地提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第一书记泽登巴尔在三中全会的报告中曾指出：“我们面临的刻不容缓的任务是迅速提高我国生产力的发展水平，推动经济、文化向前发展，使它迅速提高到整个社会主义阵营的最新成就的水平。”修订的三年计划就贯串着这个精神。
    在农牧业社会主义改造取得胜利的情况下，牧业方面的主要任务是巩固合作社，大力发展牧业生产，增加牲畜头数，提高畜产品产量。计划规定，到1960年，全国牲畜的总头数将比1957年增加7.2％。
    蒙古政府对巩固农牧业合作社曾采取了许多措施。不久前，中央曾下放一批干部到合作社参加生产管理工作，对巩固合作社将起很好的作用。在发展牧业生产方面，在增加牲畜头数的同时，还要提高牲畜质量。计划规定三年内要在三百多万头牲畜中进行人工交配，改良品种。还规定了提高乳、毛、皮等畜产品产量的指标。为此，必须改进牲畜的饲养管理，扩大饲料基地，改进兽医工作。
    大量开垦荒地，大力发展农业生产，急剧增加农产品是修订后的三年计划的重要的新内容之一，这是解决国内面粉需要，为牧业生产建立巩固的饲料基地和使牧民定居的重要措施。
    蒙古党和政府提出，到1961年全国的小麦产量将要达到九至十万吨。这就是说，收获的小麦足够满足全国人民的面粉需要，使蒙古由一个粮食消费国，变为生产和加工粮食的国家。
    计划规定，到1960年全国播种面积要达到二十五万七千二百公顷，比原计划增加五万多公顷，比1957年增加十七万多公顷。为此，蒙古决定从今年开始，大量的开垦荒地。今年的垦荒任务是十二万公顷，并且决定在土质好、水源方便的地区，兴建四个以农业生产为主的国营农牧场。蒙古在垦荒和发展农业生产的工作中，得到苏联的大力援助。根据今年2月蒙苏两国政府代表团在莫斯科签订的协议，苏联供应蒙古五百五十台拖拉机、三百五十台联合收割机等机器，并且派三百名农业技术人员到蒙古帮助垦荒工作。
    蒙古农业生产过去主要依靠国营农牧场，三年计划要求农牧业合作社逐步增加耕种面积，要求合作社种植谷物、蔬菜和饲料。今年合作社已播种了二万六千多公顷土地，比去年增加了43％。合作社进一步发展农业，将很好地帮助牧业的发展，并将有助于逐步改变牧区的面貌。
    农业机械将随着农业生产的发展日益增多。到1960年，全国的拖拉机数量将比1957年增加到五点二倍，谷物的播种、收割工作将要实现机械化。农田水利工作也要积极进行，哈拉和林等两个农牧场将要完成一万一千公顷的农田水利灌溉工程；另一方面，为了灌溉牧场，将要挖修总长达一万公尺的水井。
    在工业方面，原计划规定到1960年时，工业总产值比1957年提高52％，修订后的三年计划，工业总产值提高53.2％。这是由于新增了一些工厂项目，有的新建工厂将提前投入生产。例如为了满足全国人民面粉的需要，兴建面粉厂的数量增多了；为了加快住宅建筑，将新建一个每年能装配七万平方公尺住宅的房屋预制结构工厂。三年中，工业产品都有不同程度的增长，如煤产量将从1957年的四十万七千吨增加到七十九万吨，电力从五千八百四十万瓩增加到七千零四十万瓩，砖从四千多万块增加到八千多万块，皮革加工从十二万多张增加到十九万多张。三年中，新建的工厂有面粉厂、毛纺织厂、乳品加工厂、造纸厂、热电站等，将生产面粉、纸、毛纺织品等崭新的产品。这些工厂的建设，得到苏联、中国等兄弟国家的帮助。
    手工业合作社部门在三年内将在利用地方原料的基础上增加人民生活日用品的生产。
    由于社会主义建设的全面开展，国家对基本建设的投资也增多了，修订后的基本建设投资达到八亿九千五百万图格里克（蒙币），比原计划增加一亿九千五百万图格里克，比第一个五年计划投资增加三点四倍，比第二个五年计划投资多49.5％。如果把苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家的物质技术援助和财政援助包括在内，三年内，蒙古的基本建设投资总额将达十三亿图格里克。
    三年内，蒙古的文化教育事业将进一步发展。人民的物质文化生活水平也将进一步提高，在较大的城市和居民点将逐步实行七年制教育，到1960年，普通学校学生将比1957年增加8.8％，高等学校学生将增加31.5％。在各省将要扩大和增多文化宫、俱乐部的数目，以满足人民的文化生活需要。卫生保健事业也将有很大发展。三年内为适应社会主义建设的需要，职工人数大约将增加10.4％，职工的工资总数将增加18％，同期内，合作社社员的现金收入将增加40％。由于人民的购买力增加的结果，三年的商品流通额将达到八亿五千万图格里克，比1957年增长31％。
    修订后的三年计划完全符合蒙古人民的愿望和切身利益，得到蒙古人民热烈的拥护。计划公布后，全国各地牧民和各厂矿企业职工都表示要用实际行动，提前和超额完成三年计划。最近蒙古党的各省委员会召开的全体会议，在讨论三中全会决议和三年计划时，提出了许多提前完成计划的措施。几个月来，劳动人民都为计划的胜利完成，信心百倍地努力工作着，无论在工厂、牧区，都展开了轰轰烈烈的社会主义生产竞赛。许多厂矿企业都超额完成了第一季度生产计划。农业的春耕播种工作也顺利进行，到6月中旬，播种了十四万公顷土地，比去年增加了三万多公顷。今年幼畜获得丰收，据6月中的统计，接羔六百四十多万头，成活率达到95％，超过了往年。现在，劳动人民正在为迎接蒙古人民革命胜利三十八周年开始了下半年生产建设的紧张劳动。（附图片）
