South of the Yangtze River, Lotus Seeds Can Be Gathered
Watching the "Lotus Seed Gathering Dance" Performed by the China Youth Art Troupe
Xu Chi
　　On the stage of the Beijing Workers' Club, there appeared a patch of emerald green lotus pond. Lotus seeds are being gathered in the south of the Yangtze River, the scenery is so enchanting. The music of the water village makes my heart sway. Emerald green lotus pond, red lacquered wooden basin, sitting inside are fair and delicate girls. They can only be girls from the south of the Yangtze River, paddling the wooden basin, arms gently waving.
　　I have been away from the south of the Yangtze River for so long, I haven't tasted the flavor of water caltrop for many years. My children have never even seen a water caltrop, and I haven't heard the song of lotus seed gathering for many years.
　　The south of the Yangtze River is so good, lotus seeds can be gathered there. Wild water caltrop, red water caltrop, autumn water caltrop, sand horn water caltrop, the fragrance of water caltrop fills the lotus pond... I wish autumn would come early.
　　The red lacquered wooden basin rotates gently, no small boat can compare to its agility. It's a pity that I may not be able to return to the south of the Yangtze River, nowhere is as good as our south of the Yangtze River. I can only wish the Yangtze River would flow into the Han River early, and then pray that the Han River would flow into the Yellow River early, so that the North China Plain (not just on the stage) would soon have the scenery of the south of the Yangtze River...

    江南可采菱
    观中国青年艺术团演出的“采菱舞”
    徐迟北京工人俱乐部的舞台上，出现了一片翠绿的菱塘。江南在采菱，景色多迷人。水乡的音乐，使我心摇荡。翠绿的菱塘，红漆的木盆，坐在里面的，雪白粉嫩。她们只能是江南的姑娘，把木盆划动，手臂儿虚晃我离开江南呵，已有这末久，菱角的滋味多年没有尝。儿女们一只菱也没有见过，多年没听到采菱的歌唱。江南多末好，江南可采菱。野菱、红菱、秋菱、沙角菱，菱角香味充满了菱塘……我愿意秋天早早来临。红漆的木盆轻轻的旋转，什么小船比不上它灵巧。可惜我未必能够回江南，哪儿也没有我们江南好。只好祝江水早点入汉，再祝祷汉水早点入黄，让华北大平原（不是在舞台上），早点出现江南的风光……
