　　To Prepare More High-Quality Seeds for Next Year's Bumper Harvest
　　Hubei Universally Carries Out Seed Selection Work
　　(Our newspaper, Hankou, July 23rd) Hubei Province is seizing the opportunity of early rice ripening to actively carry out seed selection activities in order to prepare seeds for an even greater early rice harvest next year.
　　Currently, in many areas of the province, seed selection organizations have been established from the commune to the team level, and specific personnel have been assigned to engage in early rice seed selection work. In some areas where seed fields have been established, efforts are being made to remove impurities and eliminate inferior plants. In areas where seed fields have not been established, early rice fields with uniform growth and less mixing are selected for careful block selection and meticulous selection. In order to reserve sufficient seeds for next year, Xiaogan, Xianning, Qichun and other counties, based on plans to expand early rice planting next year, many production teams are meticulously selecting approximately two to three thousand catties of high-quality early japonica and early indica rice varieties. Some communes in Xiaogan County also invite experienced veteran farmers to promptly appraise various high-quality early rice varieties to improve seed quality.
　　In order to properly store the seeds, many areas, based on the principle of small-quantity, decentralized storage and large-quantity, centralized storage, have cleaned and repaired warehouses from the county to the commune and team levels. Some communes in Xishui County have also specially assigned seed storage personnel.
　　All localities pay relatively close attention to the quality of seed selection. Many areas where seed fields have been established generally apply fertilizer two or three times, weed two or three times, and remove barnyard grass two or three times, and have also succeeded in removing impurities and eliminating inferior plants; areas where seed fields have not been established have not only carried out block selection, but also meticulous selection, and some have meticulously selected more than once. In order to do a good job in seed selection, many production teams in Xiaogan, Huanggang and other regions have established specialized seed selection teams and implemented an “eight-fixed” system of fixing the field block, fixing the variety, fixing the quantity, fixing the quality, fixing the time, fixing the work points, fixing the personnel, and fixing rewards and punishments. At the same time, many areas harvest, thresh, dry, and store the selected seeds separately.

    为明年大丰收多备良种
    湖北普遍开展选种工作
    本报汉口23日电　湖北省各地抓紧早稻成熟的时机，积极开展选种活动，为明年早稻更大丰收准备种子。
    目前，这个省许多地区从公社到队都建立了选种机构，并确定了专人从事早稻的选种工作。部分建立种子田的地区，正在去杂除劣。没有建立种子田的地区，都挑选了生长整齐、混杂较轻的早稻田，认真块选、刁选。为了给明年留足种子，孝感、咸宁、圻春等县根据明年扩大早稻种植的计划，许多生产队刁选的早粳、早籼良种都在二、三千斤左右。孝感县有的公社还邀请富有经验的老农，对各种早稻良种及时鉴定，以提高种子质量。
    为了把种子保管好，不少地区根据小量分散保管、大量集中保管的原则，从县到社、队都清理、修整了仓库。浠水县有的公社还专门配备了种子保管员。
    各地对选种的质量都比较注意。许多建立种子田的地区，一般都追肥二、三次，除草二、三次，提稗二、三次，并且做到了去杂除劣；没有建立种子田的地区不仅进行了块选，还进行了刁选，有的还不止刁选一次。为了使选种工作做得好，孝感、黄冈等专区许多生产队除建立了专门选种班子以外，还实行了定田块、定品种、定数量、定质量、定时间、定工分、定人员、定奖惩的“八定”制度。同时，许多地区对选好了的种子都是单收、单打、单晒、单藏。
