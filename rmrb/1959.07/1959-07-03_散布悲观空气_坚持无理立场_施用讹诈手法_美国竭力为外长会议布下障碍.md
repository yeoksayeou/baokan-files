　　Spreading Pessimistic Atmosphere, Insisting on Unreasonable Stance, Employing Blackmail Tactics
　　United States Vigorously Lays Obstacles for the Foreign Ministers' Conference

　　(Our dispatch) The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has been in recess for two weeks, and there is only a little over a week left before the resumption date. American officials and newspapers are ostentatiously indicating that the U.S. government still has no intention of changing its position of obstructing the Foreign Ministers' Conference from reaching an agreement, and is intensifying its efforts to set up new roadblocks for the second phase of the Geneva Conference.
　　World public opinion is demanding that the Geneva Conference reach an agreement on the most pressing issues of the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue after its resumption. However, American officials and their kept newspapers are trying their best to pour cold water on this reasonable expectation of world public opinion. American newspapers are vigorously propagating that the previous phase of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was "completely deadlocked," and the "Wall Street Journal" openly declared: "The Geneva Conference has collapsed." U.S. Secretary of State Herter's broadcast and television speech on June 23 also emphasized that the Geneva Conference "has not made significant progress." Herter also tried his best to distort the sincerity and efforts of the Soviet Union in seeking to solve the problem at the meeting, insisting that the Soviet Union "has not shown that it is interested in genuine negotiations," attempting to shift the responsibility for the lack of significant progress at the meeting to the Soviet Union. The purpose of the United States in doing so is obviously to create a pessimistic impression, thereby finding excuses for continuing to obstruct the progress of the meeting.
　　It is worth noting that, according to the Associated Press, some American authorities are now even expressing doubts "whether the Foreign Ministers' Conference will actually resume 'to continue seeking a solution to the Berlin issue' as arranged." At the same time, the "New York Times" in the United States is also spreading the word that "there is no reason to believe that the three-week recess will bring the two sides any closer to an agreement." "The West will have to seriously consider whether it is worth continuing negotiations."
　　Herter's broadcast and television speech even stated that the "decisive" issue is that the Soviet Union agrees to West Berlin being under "Western protection," and the United States "will continue to maintain a firm attitude on the Berlin issue." U.S. President Eisenhower's remarks at a press conference on July 1 also said that "there will be no retreat on the basic positions regarding Berlin and Germany that the U.S. government and its allies have repeatedly stated." All of this so-called "Western protection," "firm attitude," and "no retreat" is essentially to insist on the West's unreasonable occupation system of West Berlin. And this attitude of the United States is the main obstacle to reaching an agreement at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference in the past six weeks.
　　At the same time, in order to achieve the goal of continuing to occupy West Berlin, the U.S. government has once again resorted to the means of "conference blackmail" as in the past. On the one hand, U.S. officials, especially Eisenhower and Herter, have repeatedly clamored that a summit meeting "must achieve a certain degree of progress at the Geneva Conference." Eisenhower said at a press conference on the 1st that the United States "has always adopted the attitude that it is not beneficial to convene or participate in a summit meeting unless the official diplomatic agencies of the countries have discovered or prepared a basis that gives this summit meeting some hope." On the other hand, the American propaganda machine is also using the resumption of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference on July 13 to threaten and blackmail the Soviet Union. An editorial in the "New York Herald Tribune" shouted: "We hope that the Soviet leader will accept Herter's proposal if the second round of Geneva is to be more fruitful than the first round." An Associated Press report even threatened that "if the Communists do something very provocative before July 13, the allies may have to consider canceling the talks on July 13." This kind of blackmail tactics will certainly not have any good effect on the second phase of discussions at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.
　　However, many signs indicate that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the U.S. government to continue to stubbornly adhere to its position of undermining the Geneva Conference. Under the pressure of world public opinion, some relatively realistic remarks have also appeared within the U.S. ruling group, including some leaders of the Democratic Party. An article in the American "New York Herald Tribune" admitted that in the past six years, especially since 1955, the Western allies and the United States "have been going downhill." "The balance of power is significantly in favor of the Kremlin." The newspaper also said that, especially in Geneva, the West's old claims are increasingly losing their previous value, lacking new themes, new practices, and new claims. It said that if the U.S. government "cannot come up with many sets of new claims, the situation of going downhill will continue indefinitely, perhaps to fall into an abyss."

    散布悲观空气  坚持无理立场  施用讹诈手法
    美国竭力为外长会议布下障碍
    本报讯　日内瓦外长会议休会已经两周，离开复会的日期只有一个多星期了。美国的官方人士和报刊正在虚张声势地表明，美国政府仍然无意改变它阻挠外长会议达成协议的立场，并且变本加厉地想为日内瓦会议的第二阶段设下新的路障。
    世界公众都要求日内瓦会议复会后应对目前最迫切的对德和约和西柏林问题达成协议。但是美国的官方人士和御用报纸竭力向世界公众的这种合理企望浇冷水。美国报纸大力宣传前一阶段的外长会议“完全陷于僵局”，“华尔街日报”更公然宣称：“日内瓦会议已经垮台”。美国国务卿赫脱6月23日发表的广播电视演说也强调日内瓦会议“没有取得重大的进展”。赫脱并竭力歪曲苏联在会上谋求解决问题的诚意和努力，硬说苏联“没有表明它有兴趣进行真正的谈判”，企图把会议没有取得重大进展的责任推到苏联身上。美国这样做的目的，显然是想造成一种悲观的印象，从而为继续阻挠会议的进展找寻借口。
    值得注意的是，据美联社报道，目前一些美国权威人士甚至表示怀疑，“外长会议究竟是否会真正像安排的那样”复会“以继续谋求一个解决柏林问题的办法”。同时美国“纽约时报”也在散布“没有理由相信三星期的间歇会使双方对协议有任何接近。”“西方将不得不认真考虑是否值得继续谈判”。
    赫脱的广播电视演说竟表示，“决定性”的问题是苏联同意西柏林处在“西方保护”之下，美国“将继续对柏林问题保持坚定的态度。”7月1日美国总统艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上的谈话也说：“在美国政府及其盟国所一再声明的关于柏林和德国的基本立场方面，将不作任何退却”。这一切的所谓“西方保护”、“坚定态度”以及“不作任何退却”，实质上就是要坚持西方对西柏林的无理占领制度。而美国的这种态度正是阻挠过去六周中日内瓦外长会议达成协议的主要障碍。
    同时，为了达到继续占领西柏林的目的，美国政府又像过去一样，使出了“会议讹诈”的手段。一方面，美国官方，特别是艾森豪威尔和赫脱仍然一再叫嚷要举行最高级会议“必须在日内瓦会议上取得一定程度的进展”。艾森豪威尔1日在记者招待会上说，美国“始终采取着这样的态度，那就是，召开或者参加一次最高级会议是没有益处的，除非各国政府的正式外交机构发现了或者准备了使这种最高级会议具有某种希望的基础”。而另一方面，美国宣传机器也正在以7月13日日内瓦外长会议的复会，来向苏联进行要挟和讹诈。“纽约先驱论坛报”的社论叫喊：“我们希望苏联领袖接受赫脱的建议，如果要使日内瓦的第二个回合比第一个回合更有成果的话”。美联社的消息甚至威胁说，“如果在7月13日以前共产党人作出非常富于挑衅性的事情的话，盟国可能不得不考虑取消7月13日的会谈。”这种讹诈手段当然不会对日内瓦外长会议第二阶段的讨论起什么好的作用。
    但是，许多迹象表明，美国政府要继续顽固地坚持破坏日内瓦会议的立场，是愈来愈困难了。在世界舆论的压力下，美国统治集团内部包括民主党的某些领袖也出现了一些比较现实的言论。美国“纽约先驱论坛报”的一篇文章曾承认：最近六年来，特别是从1955年以来，西方盟国和美国“一直在走下坡路”。“力量的对比是克里姆林宫显著地占了上风。”这家报纸还说：特别在日内瓦，西方旧的主张越来越失去它们以前的价值，缺乏新的主题、新的作法和新的主张。它说：如果美国政府“拿不出许多套新的主张的话，走下坡路的情况将会无限期地继续下去，也许要走入万丈深渊”。
