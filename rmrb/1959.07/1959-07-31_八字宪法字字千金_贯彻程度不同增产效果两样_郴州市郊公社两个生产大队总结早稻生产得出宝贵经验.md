The Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture: Every Word is Worth a Thousand Pieces of Gold
Different Degrees of Implementation Yield Different Results in Increased Production
Two Production Brigades in the Suburbs of Chenzhou City Summarize Valuable Experiences in Early Rice Production

Changsha, July 30th (Reported by this newspaper) - The Lishu Mountain and Chengqianling production brigades of the Chenzhou City Suburbs Commune in Chen County, Hunan, are both located in mountainous areas, with abundant fertilizer sources, good irrigation, and sufficient sunlight. The soil quality is also similar. The average arable land burden per laborer in the Chengqianling Brigade is only 6.33 mu, while in the Lishu Mountain Brigade, it reaches 11 mu. In previous years, the early rice yield of Chengqianling was generally slightly higher than that of Lishu Mountain. In 1958, the average yield per mu in Chengqianling Brigade was 357 jin, while in Lishu Mountain Brigade it was only 331 jin, an average of 26 jin higher per mu than Lishu Mountain. However, this year, due to the different degrees of implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" in these two brigades, the increase in early rice production has been drastically different. This year, the 602 mu of early rice in the Lishu Mountain Brigade achieved an average yield of 507.6 jin per mu, an increase of 53.2% compared to 1958. The 291.58 mu of early rice in the Chengqianling Brigade, however, only achieved an average yield of 370 jin, an increase of only 3.6% compared to 1958.

The main experience of the Lishu Mountain Brigade's bumper early rice harvest this year is the conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution." All their early rice fields were deeply plowed to a depth of 7-9 inches, 3-4 inches deeper than in 1958, and all used the method of deep plowing with a double plow, without disturbing the soil layers. At the same time, they all selected the high-yielding and locally adapted superior variety, White-Footed Pole Nan Special No. 1, and also achieved rational close planting based on the different conditions of each plot, such as irrigation, soil quality, and sunlight. Although the Chengqianling Brigade achieved rational close planting according to the requirements of the commune Party committee, they did not do well in deep plowing. Only over 80 mu of the 291.58 mu of early rice fields were deeply plowed, and they used a single plowing method, disrupting the soil layers. In terms of variety, they did not all use White-Footed Pole Nan Special No. 1. Over 120 mu used Red-Footed Pole Nan Special No. 1, which generally yields 40-50 jin less per mu than White-Footed Pole Nan Special No. 1. Over 171 mu were planted with the untested Atomic No. 2, which is not suitable for local planting, and the average yield per mu was only over 120 jin.

In order to ensure that the early rice had sufficient fertilizer, the Lishu Mountain Brigade launched three to four concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaigns and established a fertilizer accumulation professional team. Before transplanting, an average of 400 loads of base fertilizer were applied per mu, with fine fertilizer accounting for about 60%. After transplanting, they cultivated and top-dressed two to three times according to the growth needs of the seedlings. They also paid special attention to the balance of seedling growth. For the 110 mu of third-class seedlings, after plot-by-plot inspection and identification, field management cards were established for each plot, and they were managed carefully. They were cultivated three to four times and top-dressed with 50-60 loads of fertilizer. Within half a month, all these third-class seedlings were upgraded to first and second-class seedlings. However, the Chengqianling Brigade did not seize the good opportunity for fertilizer accumulation and top-dressing before spring plowing, and arranged too much labor for other work, so that only over 80 loads of base fertilizer were applied per mu on average, with fine fertilizer accounting for only 25%. Cultivation and top-dressing were less than 20 loads per mu, and the seedlings did not grow well. Of the 291 mu, 96 mu were third-class seedlings. They did not take measures for careful management according to the specific conditions of each field. Therefore, a large part of them had not been changed by harvest time. These third-class rice fields did not produce much, only about 200 jin per mu.

The key to the Lishu Mountain Brigade's ability to conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" is that the brigade Party General Branch Committee is good at following the mass line, consulting with the masses, and fully mobilizing the production enthusiasm of everyone. For example, in deep plowing, they initially adopted the method of single plowing, which disrupted the soil layers. The masses had opinions, saying: "The yellow mud bottom has been turned to the outside, which will only reduce production." The Party General Branch Secretary, Yang Xingyan, immediately held two or three symposiums with old farmers to study solutions. The old farmers proposed the suggestions of using a double plow and combining deep plowing with layered fertilization. The General Branch accepted these opinions, conducted key tests, and then promoted them comprehensively. Regarding early rice varieties, the General Branch launched the masses to summarize and identify various early rice varieties as early as last year's early rice harvest, and selected the White-Footed Pole Nan Special No. 1, which is high-yielding and suitable for local growth, for ear selection, block selection, single threshing, single drying, and single storage. Especially in the matter of eliminating third-class seedlings, they closely relied on the masses, adopted a combination of leaders, masses, and technicians, conducted on-site consultations, found the causes of the disease for each field of rice, and prescribed the right medicine, thus ensuring the comprehensive bumper harvest of early rice. The Chengqianling Brigade did not mobilize the masses well and rely on the masses; on the contrary, they were somewhat simplistic. During deep plowing, the brigade Party General Branch did not consult well with the masses and proposed that all rice fields should be deeply plowed more than one foot. Later, the masses saw that the soil layers were disrupted and raised their opinions, but the brigade leaders did not listen to these opinions well. As a result, the quantity and quality of deep plowing did not meet the requirements of the commune Party committee. Regarding seeds, they neither summarized and identified the varieties during last year's early rice harvest and retained superior varieties, nor did they widely promote the Atomic No. 2, which had never been tried before, in the entire brigade this year. Some members did not even know the name of this early rice variety at harvest time.

The different degrees to which the Lishu Mountain and Chengqianling brigades implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" and the large difference in the magnitude of production increase have a great educational effect on cadres and the masses. Everyone recognizes that every word of the "Eight-Character Constitution" is worth a thousand pieces of gold. The Lishu Mountain Brigade is determined to use the experience of early rice's high yield to guide the production of late rice and autumn miscellaneous crops, to continue their efforts, advance victoriously, and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of grain production. The Chengqianling Brigade has also conscientiously summarized the experiences and lessons of early rice production and decided to change its work style. In addition to frequently going deep into reality, deep into the masses, and listening to the opinions of the masses, the brigade cadres have also set up old farmer technical advisory groups in the brigade and production teams, and each work team has also hired an old farmer as a technical advisor. In this way, the production enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly mobilized. In just about twelve days, they have eliminated 370 mu (out of a total of 395 mu) of middle rice third-class seedlings. Special personnel have been assigned to manage all 292 mu of late rice, and some fields have undergone the first cultivation and top-dressing. They are determined to catch up with middle rice in terms of yield, greatly exceeding early rice.

    八字宪法字字千金
    贯彻程度不同增产效果两样
    郴州市郊公社两个生产大队总结早稻生产得出宝贵经验
    本报长沙30日电　湖南郴县郴州市郊公社梨树山和城前岭两个生产大队都在山区，肥源多、水利好、阳光充足，土质也差不多，城前岭大队每一个劳力平均负担耕地面积只六亩三分三厘，而梨树山大队每一个劳力平均负担达十一亩。历年来城前岭的早稻产量一般都比梨树山稍高，1958年城前岭大队平均亩产三百五十七斤，而梨树山大队只有三百三十一斤，平均每亩比梨树山高二十六斤。但是，今年这两个大队由于对农业“八字宪法”贯彻程度不同，早稻的增产也就截然两样。今年梨树山大队的六百零二亩早稻，平均亩产达五百零七斤六两，比1958年增产53.2％；而城前岭大队的二百九十一点五八亩早稻，平均产量只有三百七十斤，仅比1958年增产3.6％。
    梨树山大队今年早稻大丰收的主要经验，是认真贯彻执行“八字宪法”。他们全部早稻田都深翻七至九寸，比1958年深三至四寸，并且全是使用套犁的深耕办法，没有打乱土层；同时，他们全部选用产量高而又适合本地生长的优良品种白脚杆南特号，还根据各个丘的水利、土质、阳光等不同条件，做到了合理密植。城前岭大队虽然根据公社党委会的要求，做到了合理密植，但在深翻方面却做得不好，二百九十一点五八亩早稻田只深翻八十多亩，而且是采用一次犁的办法，打乱了土层。在品种方面，也不是全部选用白脚杆南特号，有一百二十多亩是用的红脚杆南特号，一般平均每亩要比白脚杆南特号低四十到五十斤，有一百七十一亩多是插的全未试验过的原子二号，不适合当地种植，平均每亩产量只有一百二十多斤。
    梨树山大队为了保证早稻有足够的肥料，先后开展了三至四次突击积肥运动，并成立了积肥专业队，插秧前平均每亩施足了底肥四百担，精肥占60％左右，插秧后，又根据禾苗生长的需要，中耕追肥二至三次。他们还特别注意了禾苗生长的平衡。一百一十亩三类苗，经过逐丘检查，逐丘鉴定，每丘都建立了田间管理卡片，加工管理，普遍中耕三至四次，追肥五十至六十担。半个月时间内，这些三类苗就全部升级为一、二类苗。但是城前岭大队在春耕前没有抓住积肥、追肥的好机会，把过多劳力安排在其它工作方面，以致平均每亩只施底肥八十多担，精肥仅占25％，中耕追肥，每亩也不到二十担，禾苗生长不好，二百九十一亩中就有三类苗九十六亩，他们并没有根据各丘田的具体情况，采取加工管理的措施，因此，一直到收割时还有很大一部分没有改变过来。这些三类禾产量都不高，每亩只二百来斤。
    梨树山大队所以能认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，关键是大队党总支委员会善于走群众路线，与群众同谋共断，充分发挥每一个人的生产积极性。比如深翻，开始他们也是采取一次犁的办法，打乱了土层，群众有意见，说：“把黄泥底都翻到外面来了，只有减产。”党总支书记杨兴炎即召开了两三次老农座谈会，研究解决办法，老农提出犁套犁和结合深翻分层施肥的建议。总支接受了这些意见，重点试验以后，全面推广。早稻品种，总支早在去年收割早稻时，就发动群众对各种早稻品种进行了总结鉴定，选定了产量高、又适宜本队生长的白脚杆南特号，穗选、块选、单打、单晒、单藏。特别是在消灭三类苗这件事情上，更是紧密依靠了群众，采取领导、群众和技术员三结合，临田会诊，找出每一丘禾的病因，对症下药，因而保证了早稻的全面大丰收。而城前岭大队就没有很好发动群众，依靠群众，相反的还有些简单从事。深翻时，大队党总支没有与群众很好商量，就提出所有稻田全部深翻一尺以上，后来群众看到打乱土层，提出了意见，但大队领导上没有很好听取这些意见，结果深翻数量、质量都没有达到公社党委提出的要求。种子，他们既没有在去年收割早稻时对品种进行总结鉴定，留下优良品种；今年又把从未试种过的原子二号在全大队大量推广，有些社员到收割时还不知道这种早稻品种叫什么名字。
    梨树山和城前岭两个大队贯彻农业“八字宪法”的程度不同，增产幅度悬殊很大的事实，对干部、群众的教育作用很大。大家都认识到“八字宪法”字字值千金。梨树山大队决心把早稻的丰产经验，用来指导晚稻和秋杂作物的生产，再接再厉，乘胜前进，争取粮食生产全面大丰收。城前岭大队也认真总结了早稻生产经验教训，决定改变工作作风，大队干部除经常深入实际、深入群众、倾听群众意见，并在大队、生产队设立了老农技术顾问小组，每个作业组也聘请了一个老农作技术顾问。这样，就大大地调动了群众的生产积极性，仅十二天左右时间，就消灭了中稻三类苗三百七十亩（共有三百九十五亩），二百九十二亩晚稻全部确定了专人管理，部分田已进行第一次中耕追肥，他们决心叫晚稻产量赶上中稻，大大超过早稻。
