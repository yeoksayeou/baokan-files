People's Commune Harvesting Wheat (Two Poems)
	The grinding stone at the field head whines,
	Sickles across the land laugh heartily.
	The roar of the harvester now near, now far,
	The fully loaded convoys speed on the road.
	Tall mules and big horses hold their tails high and heads up,
	The rollers in the field roll and jump with joy.
	Songs from the kindergarten fill the whole village,
	The aroma of food from the canteen fills the streets.
	The People's Commune is harvesting wheat,
	New poems, new paintings, new tunes…

	Wheat fields are a vast ocean,
	Wheat fields are a vast ocean,
	The wind urges golden waves rolling in!
	The combine harvester is like a ship going out to sea,
	Riding the wind and waves,
	Expressing its aspirations…
	The “ocean” is opened up by the commune members,
	The "ship" is a domestically produced "East Wind" brand.
	Young men whip their horses on the sea,
	Girls sit proudly in the driver's seat…

    人民公社收麦了（二首）
    叶浓地头磨石哇哇叫，满地镰刀哈哈笑。收割机的轰响忽近忽远，满载的车队在大路上飞跑。高骡大马竖着尾巴昂着头，场里的碌碡高兴得连滚带跳。幼儿园的歌声飞满全村，食堂的饭菜香满街道。人民公社收麦了，新的诗，新的画新的歌调……麦田是汪洋大海麦田是汪洋大海，风催金浪滚滚而来！康拜因像出海的舰艇，乘风破浪，敞抒胸怀……“大海”是公社社员开，“舰艇”是国产的东风牌。小伙子在海上挥鞭跃马，姑娘傲坐在驾驶台……
