Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 2nd: Iraqi Military Governor Ahmed Saleh al-Abdi recently issued Announcement No. 100, affirming the validity of his Announcement No. 1, which stipulates that without special permission, people are prohibited from carrying firearms and other weapons of all kinds. Violators will be sentenced to imprisonment of up to three years and fined no more than 150 dinars.

According to today's "Al-Zaman" newspaper, Military Governor Abdi ordered the return of property to certain "unprosecuted" citizens, including former Minister of Social Affairs Taleb. In an announcement issued on April 2, Abdi had declared the confiscation of these people's movable and immovable property "for the needs of the public interest" because they were accused of participating in the Mosul rebellion.

Prior to this, Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim issued a public announcement on the evening of June 25, calling on those who participated in the rebellion in the northern border region in May to return to their villages.

According to newspaper reports, a group of Kurds, incited by imperialist elements, staged a rebellion against the Republic government a month ago. The People's Resistance Forces put down the rebellion. Some of those who participated in the rebellion fled to Turkey and Iran.

Qasim said in the announcement that "each of them is a good citizen loyal to the immortal Iraqi Republic" and announced a complete and unconditional amnesty for them. The deadline for these people to return to the country is from now until the end of July 1959.

    伊拉克当局通告禁止人民携带武器
    并赦免一批曾参加叛乱的分子
    新华社巴格达2日电　伊拉克军事长官艾哈迈德·萨勒·阿卜迪最近发布了第一百号通告，肯定他的第一号通告的效力，第一号通告规定，无特别许可，禁止人民携带各种火器和其他武器。违者将处以三年以下的徒刑和科以不超过一百五十第纳尔的罚金。
    据“时代报”今天报道，军事长官阿卜迪下令发还某些“没有被起诉的”公民的财产，其中包括前社会事务部长塔列布。阿卜迪在4月2日发布的通告中曾经宣布“为了公众利益的需要”没收这些人的动产和不动产，因为他们被控参加了摩苏尔叛乱。
    在这以前，伊拉克总理卡塞姆6月25日晚上发表公告号召5月在北部边境地区参加叛乱的那些人回到他们的村庄去。
    据报纸报道，一个月以前，有一批库尔德族人在帝国主义分子的煽动下进行叛乱，反对共和国政府。人民抵抗部队平定了这次叛乱。参加叛乱的一部分人逃到土耳其和伊朗去。
    卡塞姆在公告中说，他们“每一个人都是忠于不朽的伊拉克共和国的善良公民”，并且宣布毫无例外地全部赦免他们。这些人归国的期限是从现在起到1959年7月底为止。
