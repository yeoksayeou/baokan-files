Teaching by Region and Industry
Xisi Commercial Workers' Spare-time School Regularized

    This newspaper reports that the Xisi Commercial Workers' Spare-time School in the Xicheng District of Beijing is doing a good job. It has found reliable study time for employees by combining it with improvements in business operations. The teaching content is linked to practical realities, and the political, cultural, and professional knowledge learned by the students is increasingly promoting the improvement of business operations.
    The Xisi Commercial Workers' Spare-time School was established in October of last year. The school's students include 860 business units from eleven industries in the Xisi area, including department stores, non-staple food, photography, hardware, barber shops, bathhouses, and catering. There are currently 1,060 students, accounting for two-thirds of the total number of employees. The business hours of these stores are inconsistent, and each industry has its own political and professional activities. When the workers' spare-time school was first established last year, the attendance rate often did not reach 40%, and sometimes only two or three people came to school, making it impossible to hold classes. Could a commercial workers' spare-time school be run well? The Party Committee of the Xisi Retail Commercial General Store mobilized the school's internal staff and employees from various industries to openly debate the issue. The majority of the current employees have a cultural level of primary school, and some cannot even issue invoices or fill out purchase orders, and some cannot calculate accounts. Therefore, most employees felt an urgent need to study, but when it came to studying, everyone complained about being busy, and time was indeed a big problem. With ten hours of business a day, they also had to organize goods, count cash, and clean cabinets and floors before and after business hours, as well as attend various business meetings. Where would they find the time to study?

  Rational Arrangement of Work Squeezes out Time for Study

    The Party Committee of the Xisi Retail Commercial General Store guided everyone to calculate carefully and tap into the potential for time by combining it with work improvements. This calculation revealed many tricks, such as arranging the work of counting goods and cash during business hours, counting cash as it was sold, and replenishing goods as they were sold. This freed up half an hour each day. In the past, salespersons would all go to the counter together whether there was anything to do or not. Now, according to the busyness of business, they work in batches every day, and people can be drawn out to study during idle business hours. Similarly, neighboring stores with the same nature used to have the same business hours. Now, one opens and closes an hour earlier, and the other opens and closes an hour later. This not only facilitates customers but also frees up study time. For example, a central store has several branch stores. In the past, the purchase of the same goods was carried out in segments by each branch store. Now, they are united and carried out uniformly by one person. In this way, one labor force can be saved for every three branch stores. Some stores' business teams originally had too detailed division of labor. As long as the scope of the division of labor is appropriately expanded, manpower can also be adjusted according to different levels of busyness.
    After the potential was found, the rules of busyness for different industries and different stores are different, and it is impossible to concentrate everyone for study at the same time of day. The Party Committee of the Xisi Retail Store General Store decided that cultural classes should be taught separately by region, with the same content taught three times in the morning, noon, and evening. This allows employees of each store to attend classes according to their own free time. Political and professional classes are conducted separately by industry. The Party Committee of the Xisi Retail Commercial General Store also sent working groups to various industries to adjust labor organization and business hours, and arranged work, study, and rest according to store and person. Department stores and fruit stores are busy at noon and in the evening, so they study in the morning. Fish, meat, and vegetable stores are busy in the morning, so they study at noon. Hardware and Chinese medicine stores do not have particularly busy or idle times every day, so they are divided into three shifts to work and study in rotation. After this arrangement, the working hours of employees have generally been shortened by one to two hours compared to the original. Usually, the Party Committee uniformly controls activities to ensure that spare time for study is not encroached upon. A small number of employees who have temporary matters and cannot attend classes on time, the teachers of the workers' spare-time school arrange time for them to make up lessons. The teachers of this school are very concerned about the students who are absent from class, and whenever a student is absent, they immediately ask someone to send a letter to the excused student to inform them of the make-up time. Therefore, the students are very satisfied and have also improved their enthusiasm for learning.

          Determine Teaching Content According to Specific Business
          Both Improve Ideology and Promote Work

    In order to meet the needs of the students, the spare-time school has also made improvements in the teaching content and teaching methods in accordance with the principle of learning for application. After half a year of study, most students have made significant improvements in culture, politics, and business. In language classes, in addition to teaching basic knowledge, they also select some articles related to commercial work as teaching materials, such as teaching commodity names in lower grades. In this way, some employees who did not know many characters can now issue invoices and make purchase plans. The political class mainly focuses on systematically teaching common sense of philosophy, political economics, and the history of the Chinese Communist Party, and also regularly conducts education on the situation and commercial policies. In order to facilitate education in connection with the thoughts of employees, the political class is taught by the Party Branch Secretary of each industry center store, who prepares lessons uniformly and conducts them separately by industry. Classes are held twice a week for four hours. Professional classes are also conducted separately by industry, twice a week for four hours. The main focus is on organizing on-site performances to exchange experiences around the socialist labor competition movement, with skilled salespersons opening small training classes, or signing master-apprentice contracts with new salespersons. In the past six months, fifteen experts have been trained in various industries. For example, Yu Qingzhi, who sells pork, could clear the bones of half a pig weighing forty pounds in nine minutes in March of this year, but now it only takes one minute and fifty-four seconds. Li Xiugeng, who sells cloth, has shortened the time it takes to measure a bolt of cloth from forty-six seconds to thirty-nine seconds. In addition, more than thirty new salespersons have now become skilled barbers, chefs, and meat cutters.

    按地区行业分别进行教学
    西四商业职工业余学校经常化
    本报讯　北京西城区西四商业职工业余学校办的好，结合改进业务工作为职工找到了可靠的学习时间；教学内容联系实际，学
  员所学的政治、文化、业务知识日益促进着业务工作的改进。
    西四商业职工业余学校是在去年10月成立的。这个学校所收的学员包括了西四地区的百货、副食品、照相、五金器材、理发、浴池、饮食等十一个行业的八百六十个营业单位。现有学员一千零六十人，占全体职工总数的三分之二。这些商店营业时间不一致，各行业又有各行业的政治业务活动。去年职工业余学校刚办时，出席率常常达不到40％，有时只有两三人到校，根本无法上课。商业职工业余学校能不能办好？西四零售商业总店党委发动学校内部和各行业的职工一齐鸣放辩论。现有职工的文化水平多数是小学水平，有的还不会开发票、填写进货单，有的不会算帐。因此多数职工感到迫切需要学习，可是一谈到学习，大家又叫忙，时间的确是个大问题。一天营业十小时，营业前后还要整理商品、清点货款、打扫橱柜和地面，还要开各种业务会，那有时间来学习呢？
  合理安排工作　挤出时间学习
    西四零售商业总店党委引导大家算细帐，结合改进工作挖掘时间潜力。这一算，大家发现了好多窍门，如把清点商品、货款等工作安排在营业时间里进行，货款随卖随清点，商品随卖随补进。这样每天就腾出了半小时。过去有事没事售货员一齐上柜台，现在按照营业忙闲情况，每天分批上班，营业空闲时间就可以抽出人来学习。同样性质的友邻商店，过去营业时间相同，现在一个提早一小时开门、关门，一个推迟一小时开门、关门，这样既便利顾客，也抽出了学习时间。又如一个中心店下面有好几个门市部，过去采购相同的商品，由各门市部分段进行，现在联合起来统一由一个人进行，这样每三个门市部就可节省一个劳动力。有些店的营业小组原先分工过细，只要把分工范围适当扩大，也能按忙闲不同情况调剂人力了。
    潜力找出来了，不同行业不同商店忙闲规律不一样，不可能在一天以内同一个时间把大家集中起来学习。西四零售商店总店党委决定文化课按地区划分分别进行教学，每次讲同一内容，分早晨、中午、晚上三班讲三次。这样就可使各店职工按自己的空闲时间来上课。政治课、业务课按行业分别进行。西四零售商业总店党委又派出工作组到各行业调整劳动组织和营业时间，按店按人安排工作、学习、休息。百货、果品店中午、晚上营业忙，就在早晨进行学习。鱼肉蔬菜店早上忙，就在中午学习。五金器材、国药等店，每天分不出特忙特闲的时间，就分成三班轮流工作学习。这样安排以后，职工的工作时间普遍比原先缩短了一到二小时。平时党委又统一控制活动，保证学习的业余时间不受侵占。少数职工临时有事，不能按时上课，职工业余学校的教师就为他们安排时间进行补课。这个学校的教师对缺课的学员非常关心，每当有学员缺课时，就立即把补课的时间托人带信转给请假的学员。因此学员们都很满意，也提高了学习积极性。
          根据具体业务确定教学内容
          既提高了思想又推动了工作
    这个业余学校为了满足学员的需要，在教学内容、教学方法上也按照学以致用的原则作了改进。多数学生经过半年学习，文化、政治、业务都有明显的提高。他们在语文课里，除了讲授基本知识外，也选一些和商业工作有关的文章作教材，如低年级教些商品名称。这样，原来一些识字不多的职工，现在也能开发票、作进货计划了。政治课以系统的讲授哲学、政治经济学常识和中共党史为主，也经常进行形势与商业政策的教育。为了便于联系职工思想进行教育，政治课由各行业中心店的党支部书记担任，统一备课，按行业分散进行，每隔一星期上两次课，四小时。业务课也是按行业分散进行，每隔一星期上两次课四小时。主要是围绕社会主义劳动竞赛运动，组织现场表演交流经验，由技术好的售货员开小训练班，或者和新售货员订师徒合同等办法进行学习。半年来在各行业中培养了十五名能手。如售猪肉的于庆芝，今年3月把四十斤重的半个猪的骨头剔清是九分钟，而现在只要一分五十四秒。售布的李秀庚量一匹布由用四十六秒缩短到了三十九秒。另外有三十多个新售货员，现在已经成了有技术的理发师、厨师、剔肉工。
