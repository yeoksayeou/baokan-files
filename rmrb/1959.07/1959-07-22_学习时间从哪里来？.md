Many people, when talking about improving their work, feel an urgent need to study. But when they talk about studying, they often frown and say they don't have time. The problem lies in the time. Where does time come from?

The solution to study time adopted by the retail businesses in Xisi District, Beijing, as reported in this newspaper today, is worth noting. Some of them also felt they didn't have time for study before, but after a detailed investigation and research into the actual situation of their work hours, they found that they were not busy all the time within a day, not busy every day within a week, not busy every week within a month, and not everyone was busy in a store. By lining up the busy and idle periods of each day, each week, and each month, study time was squeezed out.

This gives us an inspiration: there are two different attitudes and methods to solve the problem of study time. One is to be trapped in the busyness, shouting about being busy, letting the days go by, and while others are studying, they are still shaking their heads and sighing, "No time." The other is the same attitude and method adopted by the Xisi Retail Business Party Committee. They acknowledge that the work is busy, but they are not passively trapped in the busyness. They actively analyze the characteristics of their work, find out the patterns of busy and idle times, and then arrange things properly, which not only improves the working methods but also wins study time.

Under normal circumstances, every industry or individual standing in different work positions cannot always be busy without any idle time day after day and month after month. Every job has its own rhythm of movement. As long as we truly face the facts and seriously study it, we will find idleness within the busyness.

### 学习时间从哪里来？

    学习时间从哪里来？
    有不少人谈到改进工作，就感到迫切需要学习。而谈到学习时又常常绉眉头说没有时间。问题就出在时间上。时间从何而来呢？
    本报今天发表的北京西四区零售商业解决学习时间的办法，值得重视。他们之中有些人，在这以前也认为学习没有时间，可是对工作时间的实际状况作了详细的调查研究，就发现一天之内不是时时忙，一周之内不是天天忙，一月之内不是周周忙，一店之内也不是人人忙，把每天、每周、每月的忙闲情况一排队，学习时间就挤出来了。
    这给我们一个启发，解决学习时间有两种不同的态度与方法。一种是陷于忙乱中，叫喊忙，日月如斯，别人在学习了，他还在一边摇头兴叹“没有时间”。另一种是和西四零售商业党委所采取的态度和方法相同，他们承认工作忙，但不是被动地陷在忙里面。他们主动地分析自己工作的特点，找出忙闲的规律来，然后妥善地安排，既改进了工作方法，又赢得了学习时间。
    每个行业或者站在不同工作岗位上的个人，在正常情况下，他们的工作不可能日日月月始终只有忙而无闲的。每一项工作都有它本身的运动节奏。只要我们真正面对事实，认真地研究一下，就会找出忙中之闲来。
