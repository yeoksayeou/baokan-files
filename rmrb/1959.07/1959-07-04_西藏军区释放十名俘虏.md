Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 3rd. The People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region’s pacification troops recently released ten important captives captured during the suppression of the rebellion in the Lhasa area, including Rampa Langji Wangqiu, a former fourth-rank official of the Tibet local government and former head of the Dalai Lama's office in Beijing, and Dezhu Jiangbai Gesang, a Living Buddha of the Muru Monastery.

    When the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group launched an armed rebellion betraying the motherland, Rampa Langji Wangqiu signed to plot and support the treasonous activities of "Tibetan independence" and served as "Zhao Ji" (Tibetan currency factory director) in the rebel group. Dezhu Jiangbai Gesang distributed a large number of amulets to the rebels during the rebellion and encouraged the rebellion. After being captured, under the patient education of the People's Liberation Army's pacification troops and inspired by the policy of leniency towards prisoners, they had a relatively deep understanding of their treasonous crimes, confessed their crimes, and expressed their willingness to turn over a new leaf. The People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region's pacification troops, based on their expressions of repentance, granted them lenient treatment, held a release meeting on the afternoon of July 1, issued them release certificates, and announced their release to return home.

    西藏军区释放十名俘虏
    新华社拉萨3日电　人民解放军西藏军区平叛部队最近释放了在平息拉萨地区叛乱中俘获的十名重要俘虏，其中包括原西藏地方政府的大四品官、曾任达赖喇嘛驻京办事处处长然巴·朗吉旺秋和目如寺活佛第珠·降白格桑等。
    在原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动背叛祖国的武装叛乱时，然巴·朗吉旺秋曾签名策划和支持“西藏独立”的叛国活动，并在叛乱集团中任“赵基”（藏币厂厂长）。第珠·降白格桑在叛乱时发给叛乱分子大量护身符，鼓励叛乱。他们被俘以后，在人民解放军平叛部队的耐心教育和宽待俘虏政策的感召下，对自己的叛国罪行有了比较深刻的认识，交代了自己的罪行，并表示愿意痛改前非。人民解放军西藏军区平叛部队根据他们悔过的表现，特予宽大处理，在7月1日下午举行了释放大会，给他们发了释放证，宣布释放他们回家。
