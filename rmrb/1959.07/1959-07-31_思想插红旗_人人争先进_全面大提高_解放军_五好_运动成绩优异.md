Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: The People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces have, in the past year, produced 32,268 "Five-Good" units, and over 296,300 "Five-Good" soldiers and "Five-Good" cadres. These "Five-Good" units and "Five-Good" officers and soldiers have achieved excellent results in military training, political education, cultural learning, sports and hygiene, increased production and thrift, and supporting industrial and agricultural construction. Some have even become models in various aspects of the military's work.

The "Five-Good" movement is a mass movement to cultivate outstanding communist fighters and strive for overall excellence. Its content is: good at study, good at work, good at protecting weapons and eliminating accidents, good at production and thrift, and good health. Last spring, after the rectification movement, the socialist consciousness of officers and soldiers greatly increased, and revolutionary enthusiasm soared to unprecedented heights. In order to guide the enthusiasm and drive of officers and soldiers in the main direction and consolidate and develop it, the General Political Department of the PLA issued instructions to the entire army in May to carry out the "Five-Good" movement. This movement was welcomed by the vast number of officers and soldiers from the very beginning. Under the leadership of the Party committees, the units quickly formed a movement of saying "Five-Good", singing "Five-Good", learning "Five-Good", and striving for "Five-Good".

The "Five-Good" movement promoted a surge in military training to strive for "one specialty with multiple skills, one soldier with multiple uses." Many "Five-Good" units and individuals are vanguards in military training. In the artillery units, some "Five-Good" units have every soldier mastering all the actions on the artillery piece relatively skillfully, and some can even drive artillery vehicles and act as artillery commanders. Many "Five-Good" soldiers of the armored forces, on the basis of being proficient in their own business, can drive tanks and operate artillery, and some have also learned the commander's movements. In the navy, many "Five-Good" soldiers are "excellent" in their own jobs and can operate guns and artillery on ships, master navigation, measure wind direction and water depth, and identify directions. Some can also troubleshoot mechanical failures and repair ships for medium and small repairs. In the air force, many "Five-Good" pilots have the ability to fly in all weather conditions, take off during the day, fight in the night sky, drive in clouds, and fly safely in wind and rain. In the infantry units, many "Five-Good" soldiers shoot "excellently," and their movements are accurate and rapid in tactical training. Many are also "multi-skilled gunners" who can skillfully use several types of light weapons.

Many "Five-Good" units and individuals have also made great achievements in inventions and technical innovations in military equipment. Some have created equipment that reduces the load on the troops and increases their mobility, while others have invented new equipment and technologies that accelerate the troops' combat readiness. In the engineering units of the Shenyang, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and other regions, some "Five-Good" units have further improved the level of mechanization in construction through technical innovation.

Many "Five-Good" units and individuals are very active in cultural and health work and sports activities. In a regiment composed of Yi people in the Chengdu area, the "Five-Good" soldiers are always reading, teaching, and learning from each other. Most of them were once slaves of feudal lords and had never attended school, but now they can all read and write letters. Some "Five-Good" units have not had a single patient all year round due to their good work in eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene. A certain artillery regiment is a "Five-Good" regiment, and all officers and soldiers have met the standards of the Labor and Defense System, and 20% of them have obtained first and second-level Labor and Defense System badges.

This year, the troops planted more than 412,000 mu of land, raised more than 700,000 pigs, and harvested more than 100 million jin of vegetables in the first half of the year. A certain "Five-Good" regiment in the Nanjing area not only achieved basic self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables, but also saved more than 59,000 jin of coal, more than 3,700 jin of grain, and 66% of various expenses. In supporting industrial and agricultural construction, many "Five-Good" units and individuals provide manpower wherever it is needed, and wherever conditions are difficult, becoming shock brigades in production and construction.

The "Five-Good" movement has also played a great role in improving the communist consciousness of officers and soldiers. Soldiers say: To be a "Five-Good" soldier, politics is fundamental, thought must fly the red flag, and individuals must strive to be advanced. They call each evaluation "encouraging the advanced and improving comprehensively." In many units, the collectivist thought and spirit of cooperation, "if one person has shortcomings, everyone helps, and if a neighboring unit has difficulties, everyone supports," has become the norm. In order to strive for overall excellence, officers and soldiers are chasing after each other, striving to be ahead, and their revolutionary enthusiasm is always full and abundant. Now, this movement is developing more deeply and broadly. The soldiers sing joyfully: The "Five-Good" movement is a flower, the soldiers love it in their hearts, and they are full of energy to strive for the upper reaches and strive to wear the "Five-Good" flower.

    思想插红旗  人人争先进  全面大提高
    解放军“五好”运动成绩优异
    学习好　工作好　爱护武器消灭事故好　生产节约好　身体好
    据新华社30日讯　中国人民解放军陆海空三军，在最近的一年中，涌现出“五好”单位三万二千二百六十八个，“五好”战士和“五好”干部二十九万六千三百多名。这些“五好”单位和“五好”官兵在军事训练、政治教育、文化学习、体育卫生、增产节约以及支援工农业建设等各个方面成绩都很优异，有的还成了部队各项工作中的标兵。
    “五好”运动是培养优秀的共产主义战士、争取全面优胜的群众运动。它的内容是：学习好，工作好，爱护武器、消灭事故好，生产节约好，身体好。去年春天，各部队经过整风运动，官兵们的社会主义觉悟大大提高，革命热情空前高涨。解放军总政治部为了把官兵们的热情和干劲引向主要方向，并使其巩固发展下去，5月向全军发出了开展“五好”运动的指示。这一运动一开始就受到广大官兵的欢迎。各部队在党委的领导下，很快形成了说
  “五好”，唱“五好”，学“五好”，争“五好”的运动。
    “五好”运动推动了军事训练中争取“一专多能，一兵多用”的热潮。许多“五好”单位和个人都是军事训练中的尖兵。在炮兵部队里，有些“五好”单位，每一个士兵都能较熟练地掌握火炮上的所有动作，有的还能驾驶炮车，代理炮长指挥。装甲兵的“五好”战士，在熟练本身业务的基础上，许多人能开坦克，操火炮，有的人还学会了车长的指挥动作。海军中，许多“五好”战士在本职业务“全优”的同时，能在舰艇上用枪操炮，掌握导航，能测量风向、水深，辨别方位，有的人还会排除机械故障，中修和小修船只。在空军，“五好”飞行员中许多人有“全天候”飞行的本领，白天能起飞，夜空能作战，云雾里能驾驶，狂风暴雨中能安全飞行。在步兵部队里，不少“五好”战士射击打“优秀”，战术学习中动作准确迅速，许多人还是“多能枪手”，能够熟练地使用几种轻火器。
    许多“五好”单位和个人在部队军事装备的发明创造和技术革新上，也有很大成绩。他们有的创造出减轻部队负荷量，增加部队机动性的装备，有的发明了加速部队战斗准备的新器材，新技术。沈阳、南京、广州等地区部队的工程兵部队，有些“五好”单位还通过技术革新，进一步提高了施工中的机械化水平。
    在文化卫生工作和体育活动中，许多“五好”单位和个人都很活跃。成都地区部队由彝族人民组成的一个团里，“五好”战士都是手不释卷，互教互学。他们过去多半是封建主的奴隶，没读过书，现在都能读书写信了。有些
  “五好”单位由于除四害、讲卫生工作做得好，长年没有一个病号。某部炮兵团是“五好团”，全体指战员都达到了劳卫制标准，并有20％的人获得了一、二级劳卫制证章。
    今年，部队种地四十一万二千多亩，养猪七十多万头，上半年收菜一亿多斤。南京地区部队某“五好”团，不仅做到了肉菜基本自给，还节约了煤五万九千多斤，粮食三千七百多斤，各种经费66％。支援工农业建设中，不少“五好”单位和个人，要人有人，哪里艰苦到哪里去，当上了生产建设的突击队。
    “五好”运动对提高官兵们的共产主义觉悟也有很大作用。战士们说：要当“五好”兵，政治是根本，思想插红旗，个人争先进。他们称每次评比是“鼓舞先进，全面提高”。在许多部队里，“一人有缺点，大家来帮助，友邻有困难，大家来支援”的集体主义思想和协作精神，已经成了风气。官兵们为了争取全面优胜，你追我赶，步步争先，革命热情始终饱满充沛。现在，这一运动正在更深更广地发展。战士们喜气洋洋地唱道：“五好”运动是朵花，战士心里喜爱它，鼓足干劲争上游，争取戴上“五好”花。
