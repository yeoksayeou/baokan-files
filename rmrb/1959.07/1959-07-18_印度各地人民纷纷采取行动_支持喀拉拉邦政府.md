Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 17th: A large-scale mass rally was held in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala, on the 16th, to express support for the government led by the Communist Party of India.

Amidst torrential rain, thousands of people held demonstrations in the streets, shouting slogans to defend the state government. A packed crowd lined both sides of the three-mile-long road. On the 15th, the opposition in the state held demonstrations demanding the dissolution of the state government.

Mass rallies and demonstrations in support of the Kerala government have also been held in other parts of Kerala and in other states. In Ernakulam, 25,000 workers marched on the 12th, expressing their unreserved support for the Kerala government.

The latest issue of the "New Age" weekly reported that in the past week, organized workers have issued statements and passed resolutions to express their support for the Kerala government, including the most representative Andhra Pradesh Trade Union Congress, 16 trade unions in West Bengal, textile workers in Amritsar, and construction workers' unions in Jaipur.

According to the "Crossroads" newspaper, nearly 17,500 citizens in Calcutta wrote postcards to the President of India, opposing central interference in Kerala. According to the Press Trust of India, sixty prominent figures, professors, businessmen, artists, and city councilors in Calcutta submitted an appeal to the President of India, pointing out the need to "stop the unconstitutional and unpleasant struggle against the legally elected government of Kerala." Thirty-two lawyers from the Patna High Court stated in a statement submitted to the President of India that all sensible people should stop the Congress Party's "suicidal policy" in Kerala. Fifty-one lawyers in Allahabad, in a joint statement issued on July 10, believed that the instigation activities in Kerala were unconstitutional, and they demanded that the Congress Party discuss the issues instead of undermining basic democratic principles.

The "Blitz" published an editorial on July 10, saying, "We do not believe that a solution to the Kerala problem can be found in elections." "Unity" published an editorial last weekend, expressing opposition to the instigation activities in Kerala and central interference, and pointed out that the attitude of the Congress Party is: "First smear a person's face, and then say to him, you should be shot because your face is black."

    印度各地人民纷纷采取行动
    支持喀拉拉邦政府
    新华社新德里17日电　在喀拉拉邦首府特里凡得琅，16日举行了大规模的群众集会，表示支持印度共产党领导的政府。
    在倾盆大雨中，数千人在街道上举行示威游行，高呼保卫邦政府的口号。拥挤不堪的人群排列在三英里长的道路的两旁。在15日，邦内的反对派曾经举行示威要求解散邦政府。
    在喀拉拉邦的其它地方和别的邦内也举行了支持喀拉拉邦政府的群众大会和示威。在埃纳库拉姆，有两万五千工人在12日举行游行，表示无保留地支持喀拉拉邦政府。
    最近一期的“新世纪”周报报道，在过去一星期内，有组织的工人发表声明和通过决议来表示支持喀拉拉邦政府，其中有最具有代表性的安得拉邦工会大会、西孟加拉邦的16个工会、阿姆利则的纺织工人和斋浦尔的建筑工人工会。
    据“划时代报”报道，加尔各答有将近一万七千五百个公民写明信片给印度总统，反对中央干涉喀拉拉邦。据印度报业托辣斯报道，加尔各答六十名著名人士、教授、商人、艺术家和市议员把一项呼吁送交印度总统，指出有必要“停止对喀拉拉邦的合法当选的政府进行违反宪法的和令人不快的斗争”。巴特那高等法院的三十二名律师在送交给印度总统的声明中说，一切有见识的人应该制止国大党在喀拉拉邦的“自杀政策”。阿拉哈巴德的五十一名律师在7月10日发表的联合声明中认为在喀拉拉邦进行的煽动活动是违反宪法的，他们要求国大党讨论问题而不要破坏基本的民主原则。
    “箴言报”在7月10日发表社论说，“我们并不认为能够在选举中找到解决喀拉拉邦问题的办法”。“团结报”在上周末发表一篇社论中，表示反对喀拉拉邦内的煽动活动和中央进行干涉，并且指出国大党的态度是：“先把一个人的脸弄脏，然后对他说，你应该被枪毙，因为你的脸是黑的。”
