Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 1st: "Khuang Lao Patriotic News" published an article on June 28th stating that, according to reliable sources, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front (formerly translated as the Lao Patriotic Party), and other leaders are currently under even stricter house arrest than before.

The article says that the residences of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front are still under the strict surveillance of Lao government plainclothes police day and night. Currently, their lives and personal freedoms are threatened.

Tao Mang, a member of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, and party cadres Maha Sompoun and Tao Mana were arrested on May 14th of this year.

An issue of the "Lao Patriotic News" published in Vientiane on May 18th of this year was confiscated, and the newspaper's printing plant is under police guard.

The article points out that the above facts once again expose the propaganda department of the Phoui Sananikone government's statement that the order for the house arrest of the Lao Patriotic Front leaders has been revoked and that the Lao Patriotic Front leaders have gained freedom of action as nothing but a lie.

The article points out that the above actions of the Phoui Sananikone government not only blatantly violate the agreements signed by both sides, but also violate the laws of the Kingdom of Laos. It shows the dictatorial and reactionary nature of the Phoui Sananikone government. It also shows that the Phoui Sananikone government, facing a wave of anger from the people at home and international public opinion, has had to resort to lying statements to cover up its vile behavior. It hopes to use this method to deceive public opinion and ease the people's anger.

The article calls on the Lao people to remain vigilant at all times and resolutely oppose the above-mentioned illegal actions of the Phoui Sananikone government. The article says that the people of all ethnic groups in the country must unite more closely and struggle to demand that the Phoui Sananikone government immediately and genuinely lift the house arrest of Prince Souphanouvong, restore the freedom of other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and members of the Neutral Committee, immediately release the illegally imprisoned cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front and other peace-loving people, and allow the "Lao Patriotic News" to continue publication.

    老挝政府未撤销严密监视
    苏发努冯亲王等仍受软禁
    新华社河内1日电　“川圹老挝爱国报”6月28日发表的一篇文章说，据确实消息，老挝爱国战线党（前译老挝爱国党）主席苏发努冯亲王和其他领导人目前受到比以前更加严密的软禁。
    文章说，苏发努冯亲王和其他老挝爱国战线党领导人的住宅，仍在老挝政府便衣警察的日夜严密监视之下。目前，他们的生命安全和个人自由正受到威胁。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员涛芒，党的干部玛哈松奔、涛玛纳等人于今年5月14日被逮捕。
    今年5月18日在万象出版的一期“老挝爱国报”被没收，这家报纸的印刷厂受到警察看管。
    文章指出，上述事实，再一次揭露了培·萨纳尼空政府宣传部关于软禁老挝爱国战线党领袖的命令已经撤销、老挝爱国战线党领袖获得自由行动的声明，不过是一片谎言。
    文章指出，培·萨纳尼空政府上述行动，不但明目张胆地违反了双方签订的协议，也违反了老挝王国政府的法律。它显示了培·萨纳尼空政府的独裁和反动性质；它还说明了培·萨纳尼空政府面对国内人民和国际舆论愤怒的浪潮，不得不使用撒谎的声明来掩盖其卑劣的行为。它指望用这种办法来欺骗舆论，缓和人民的愤怒。
    文章号召老挝人民经常提高警惕，坚决反对培·萨纳尼空政府的上述违法行动。文章说，国内各民族人民必须更紧密地团结起来进行斗争，要求培·萨纳尼空政府立即和真正地撤销对苏发努冯亲王的软禁，恢复老挝爱国战线党其他领导人以及和平中立委员会各位委员的自由，立即释放被非法监禁的老挝爱国战线党的干部和其他和平人士，使“老挝爱国报”继续出刊。
