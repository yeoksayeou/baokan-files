The Cuban People Are Invincible
By Our Staff Commentator

On July 26th, a heart-stirring mass rally of a million people, unprecedented in the history of Latin America, was held in Havana, the capital of Cuba. This was a rally demonstrating the determination of the more than six million Cuban people to defend the revolution at all costs, and a demonstration of the unity of the entire Cuban nation against U.S. imperialism.

It is of special significance that the Cuban people chose July 26th to express their determination to defend the revolution and oppose U.S. intervention. As everyone knows, it was on this day six years ago that the Cuban people ignited the flames of armed struggle and launched the famous "July 26th" revolutionary movement. The entire process of this movement outlined the heroic image of the Cuban people fighting for freedom, independence, and democracy for the people of Latin America, and powerfully proved that: as long as they adhere to unity and persist in struggle, even with U.S. imperialism right next door, they can still defeat the domestic reactionary dictatorial regime armed to the teeth by U.S. imperialism. Of course, victory was achieved after paying a noble price. Precisely for this reason, the Cuban people especially cherish this victory, and they are determined to defend and consolidate it.

The current urgent task of the Cuban people is to implement land reform. Therefore, to defend the revolution also means defending land reform. This is not only because land reform is the basic content of the current stage of the Cuban national democratic revolution, but also because it is on the issue of land reform that the U.S. imperialists have nakedly exposed their shameless faces as interventionists, attempting to strangle Cuba's land reform by subverting the Cuban revolutionary regime.

The reason why U.S. imperialism is so determined to put Cuba's land reform to death is, on the one hand, to protect the illegal interests of U.S. sugar monopoly capital groups in Cuba, and on the other hand, it is out of fear of the far-reaching impact that Cuba's land reform will inevitably have throughout Latin America.

As everyone knows, pre-revolutionary Cuba had long been a paradise for American sugar company bosses. They not only supported Cuba's feudal large estate owners as tools to rule Cuba, but also, through various despicable means of coercion and plunder, made themselves the largest estate owners, controlling more than 25% of Cuba's total area. For U.S. sugar monopoly capitalists, the large estate system is the most wonderful thing, because it can ensure that Cuba remains in a state of feudal backwardness, that its productive forces are not liberated, that it is economically dependent on the United States, and at the same time, that the American bosses can extract the maximum profit from it. To compare U.S. imperialism's rule in Cuba to a tree, Batista and the pro-American dictatorial regimes before him were the branches and leaves, and the large estate system was the root. When the Batista regime was overthrown in the initial period, U.S. imperialism could still force itself to remain calm, one of the reasons being that it still harbored the illusion that a root could grow new branches and leaves. However, the Cuban revolution did not stop at the stage of cutting branches and leaves, but continued to advance, announcing the implementation of land reform, abolishing the large estate system, and prohibiting foreigners from owning Cuban land, which was naturally a fatal blow to the American sugar company bosses. U.S. imperialism has tried every possible means to sabotage and obstruct Cuba's implementation of land reform, and has openly clamored for armed intervention to threaten Cuba into abandoning land reform. One of its goals is to try to enable those sugar bosses to remain on Cuban land and continue to suck the blood and sweat of the Cuban people.

The impact of Cuba's land reform has far surpassed the Caribbean Sea and shaken the entire Latin American continent. In other Latin American countries, as in Cuba, there are the fetters of the feudal large estate system and the plunder of land by American monopoly capital. Seventy percent of the population of Latin America is made up of peasants, but more than 70% of peasant households have no land to stand on, while large landowners and foreign monopoly capital (mainly American) occupy more than two-thirds of the cultivated land in Latin America. Therefore, land reform has always been the urgent demand of the vast majority of people in Latin American countries. In recent decades, under the pressure of the people, some countries (such as Mexico, Guatemala, Bolivia, etc.) have also attempted to carry out land reforms of varying degrees, but all these land reforms have, without exception, been brutally interfered with by U.S. imperialism and died halfway. In order to obstruct Guatemala's land reform, U.S. imperialism even carried out armed intervention and overthrew the Arbenz democratic government. "No Land Reform" - this is the "rule" laid down by U.S. imperialism in Latin America.

However, Cuba is now "daring to defy" and determined to break this "rule." The news of Cuba's implementation of land reform is attracting the people of all Latin American countries like a magnet. If Cuba's land reform is successful, then not only will the people of other Latin American countries, but also U.S. imperialism itself, inevitably ask the question: If the Cuban people can do it, can't the people of other Latin American countries do it? The answer is yes. In fact, in some Latin American countries, some are preparing to expropriate land occupied by American companies (such as Guatemala), and some are also preparing to implement land reform (such as Venezuela). Encouraged by Cuba's example, the people of Latin American countries will greatly strengthen this struggle. It is precisely for this reason that U.S. imperialism is today so frantically interfering in Cuba's land reform.

Today, the political climate in Latin America has made it impossible for U.S. imperialism to simply interfere in Cuba's internal affairs under the banner of "No Land Reform," and it can only plot conspiracies of armed intervention under the tattered banner of "Opposing the Communist Threat." This kind of pretense will of course not deceive anyone. The implementation of land reform by more than six million Cuban people in their own homeland will never threaten the security of the Caribbean region or even the United States. Today, there is indeed a very serious threat to peace in the Caribbean region. This threat does not come from Cuba's land reform, but from the American military intervention in Cuba.

However, the threat of U.S. imperialism to Cuba cannot intimidate the Cuban people. The grand rally in Havana vividly demonstrated that: such people are invincible, and such people will never succumb to the threat of U.S. imperialism. The Havana conference also vividly demonstrated the unity of the Cuban people. The Cuban provisional government, after purging the traitorous elements of the Urrutia and Díaz Lanz clique, has received greater support from the Cuban people. The Cuban people will firmly advance along the road of national democratic revolution.

In these days, a movement to support Cuba and oppose U.S. intervention has been widely launched throughout Latin America. The people of Latin American countries are showing with action that they share the fate of the Cuban people in the anti-American struggle, and they are determined not to let U.S. imperialism repeat the "Guatemala incident" of 1954. The people of all countries in the world are also closely watching the struggle of the Cuban people. Their sympathy and support are entirely on the side of the Cuban people, regarding the struggle of the Cuban people as their own struggle, and cheering for every victory of the Cuban people.

The Havana conference marks a new high tide in the Cuban people's anti-American struggle. The enemy is ferocious, and the road is rugged. The Cuban people still have a long and arduous journey to achieve victory in the struggle. But we believe that since the Cuban people were able to victoriously overthrow the American-backed Batista regime, they will certainly be able to victoriously crush all new conspiracies of the United States and defend and consolidate the fruits of the revolution.

    古巴人民是不可战胜的
    本报评论员
    7月26日，古巴首都哈瓦那举行了在整个拉丁美洲史无前例、动人心魄的百万群众大会。这是一次表明古巴六百多万人民决心不惜一切代价来保卫革命的大会，也是一次古巴全国上下团结一致向美帝国主义示威的大会。
    古巴人民选择7月26日这个日子来表明他们保卫革命、反对美国干涉的决心，是有特殊的意义的。大家知道，正是在六年前的这一天，古巴人民开始燃起了武装斗争的烽火，展开了著名的“7月26日”革命运动。这一运动的全部过程，向拉丁美洲人民勾画了古巴人民为自由、独立和民主而斗争的英雄形象，并且有力地证明了：只要坚持团结、坚持斗争、即使美帝国主义就在咫尺之旁，依然可以战胜被美帝国主义武装到牙齿的本国反动独裁政权。当然，胜利是在付出了高贵的代价而后取得的。正因为如此，古巴人民特别珍视这个胜利，他们决心保卫和巩固这个胜利。
    古巴人民当前的迫切的任务，是要实行土地改革。因此，要保卫革命，也就必须保卫土地改革。这不仅因为土地改革是古巴民族民主革命当前阶段的基本内容，而且因为正是在土地改革这个问题上，美帝国主义者赤裸裸地暴露了无耻的干涉者面目，他们企图用颠覆古巴革命政权的办法来扼杀古巴的土地改革。
    美帝国主义所以必欲置古巴的土地改革于死地而后快，一方面是为了保护美国糖业垅断资本集团在古巴的非法利益，另一方面，也是出于害怕古巴土地改革在整个拉丁美洲所必将引起的深远影响。
    大家知道，革命前的古巴长期以来就是美国糖业公司老板的乐园。他们不仅扶植古巴的封建大庄园主作为统治古巴的工具，而且通过种种强取豪夺的卑鄙手段，使自己成为控制了占古巴全国面积25％以上的土地的最大的庄园主。对美国糖业垅断资本家说来，大庄园制度是最美妙不过的东西，因为它既可以保证古巴处于封建落后、生产力得不到解放、经济上必须依附美国的状态，同时又可以保证美国老板们从中掠取最大限度的利润。把美帝国主义在古巴的统治比作一棵树，巴蒂斯塔和在他之前的亲美独裁政权是枝叶，大庄园制度就是根。当巴蒂斯塔政权被推翻的最初时期，美帝国主义还略能强自镇静，原因之一就是因为它还抱着有个根就可以长出新的枝叶的幻想。然而古巴的革命并没有停留于砍削枝叶的阶段，而是继续进行，宣布实行土地改革，要废除大庄园制度，禁止外国人占有古巴土地，这对美国糖业公司老板自然是一个致命的打击。美帝国主义千方百计地破坏和阻挠古巴实行土地改革，公然叫嚣武装干涉以威胁古巴放弃土地改革，其目的之一就是企图使那些糖业老板们能够赖在古巴的土地上，继续吮吸古巴人民的血汗。
    古巴土地改革的影响远远超越了加勒比海而震动着整个拉丁美洲大陆。在拉丁美洲其他各国，也像在古巴一样，存在着封建大庄园制度的束缚和美国垅断资本对土地的掠夺。整个拉丁美洲人口的70％是农民，但70％以上的农户无立锥之地，而大地主和外国垅断资本（主要是美国）却占有拉丁美洲三分之二以上的耕地。因此，土地改革从来就是拉丁美洲各国广大人民的迫切要求。近数十年来，在人民的压力下，一些国家（如墨西哥、危地马拉、玻利维亚等）也曾经尝试进行过程度不等的土地改革，但所有这些土地改革，都无例外地受到美帝国主义的粗暴干涉而中途夭折。为了阻挠危地马拉的土地改革，美帝国主义甚至实行武装干涉，颠覆阿本斯民主政府。“不许土改”——这是美帝国主义在拉丁美洲立下的“规矩”。
    然而古巴现在却“甘冒大不韪”，决心要打破这个“规矩”了。古巴实行土地改革的消息像磁铁般地吸引着拉丁美洲各国人民。如果古巴的土地改革取得胜利，那么，不仅仅其他拉丁美洲国家的人民，而且美帝国主义自己也必然会提出这样的问题：古巴人民能够办到，难道其他拉丁美洲国家的人民就办不到吗？答复是肯定的。事实上，在一些拉丁美洲国家中，有的已准备征用美国公司占有的土地（如危地马拉），有的也准备实行土地改革（如委内瑞拉）。在古巴的榜样的鼓舞下，拉丁美洲各国人民将会大大加强这一斗争。正是由于这个原因，美帝国主义今天才如此疯狂地干涉古巴的土地改革。
    今天拉丁美洲的政治气候已经使得美帝国主义再也不能干脆打着“不许土改”的旗帜来干涉古巴的内政，而只能打着早已破烂不堪的“反对共产主义威胁”的幌子，来策划武装干涉的阴谋。这种幌子当然骗不过任何人。六百多万古巴人民在自己家园内进行土地改革决不会胁威加勒比海地区以至美国的安全。今天在加勒比海地区确实存在着对和平的极严重的威胁，这个威胁不是来自古巴的土地改革，而是来自美国对古巴的军事干涉。
    然而，美帝国主义对古巴的威胁，并不能吓倒古巴人民。哈瓦那的盛大集会生动地表明了：这样的人民是不可战胜的，这样的人民是绝对不会屈服于美帝国主义的威胁之下的。哈瓦那的大会也生动地表现了古巴人民的团结一致。清洗了乌鲁蒂亚和迪亚斯·兰斯之流卖国分子之后的古巴临时政府，得到了古巴人民更大的支持。古巴人民将坚定地沿着民族民主革命的道路前进。
    这些日子里，在整个拉丁美洲普遍展开了支持古巴和反对美国干涉的运动。拉丁美洲各国人民以行动表明他们在反美斗争中和古巴人民同命运共呼吸，他们决心不让美帝国主义重演1954年的“危地马拉事件”。全世界各国人民也密切注视古巴人民的斗争，他们的同情和支持完全在古巴人民这一边，把古巴人民的斗争当作自己的斗争，为古巴人民的每一回合的胜利欢呼。
    哈瓦那的大会标志着古巴人民反美斗争的新高潮。敌人是凶恶的，道途是崎岖的，古巴人民要取得斗争的胜利还有一段艰巨的历程。但是我们相信，古巴人民既然能胜利地推翻美国扶植的巴蒂斯塔政权，也一定能胜利地粉碎美国的一切新阴谋，保卫和巩固革命的成果。
