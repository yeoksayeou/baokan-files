    Operatic Dance Drama "Shi Yi Chops Wood" Performed
    The Tianjin People's Art Theatre Dance Troupe recently performed the dance drama "Shi Yi Chops Wood," which was well-received by audiences.
    This dance drama is adapted from the widely circulated folk tale of "Little White Dragon," consisting of eight scenes. The woodcutter Shi Yi is chopping wood on a hillside when suddenly a strong wind rises, sand and stones fly, and the evil shadow of the nine-headed bird flashes across the sky. Shi Yi throws his axe and chops at the demon, and an embroidered shoe falls from the sky... The story begins here. Later, at a bustling temple fair, a palace official reads the king's proclamation: the princess has been captured by the nine-headed bird, and whoever rescues the princess will be given her in marriage. The brave and kind Shi Yi volunteers to accept the proclamation to eliminate the harm for the people and sets out to rescue the princess. At this time, Wang En, who is drunk, expresses his willingness to go with Shi Yi to find and rescue the princess, harboring greed and a desire to get lucky. Following the bloodstains of the wounded monster, they enter the deep mountains and forests and find the demon's cave entrance. At this moment, the timid Wang En asks Shi Yi to go down into the cave alone. After Shi Yi enters the cave, he kills the demon and rescues the princess. As a result, the princess falls in love with the brave and selfless Shi Yi, breaks a golden hairpin, and gives him half as a token of her love. However, after the princess comes out of the cave, Wang En seizes the princess and "kicks a man when he's down," blocking the cave entrance with a large stone.
    Just as Wang En is triumphantly about to marry the princess, the princess's veil is suddenly blown away by the wind, and she recognizes that the groom is not the person she loves. At this time, Shi Yi, with the help of the masses, arrives at the palace and recounts the process of slaying the demon and rescuing the princess, then produces the feathers of the nine-headed bird as proof. Finally, Shi Yi takes out the half of the golden hairpin given to him by the princess, and the princess also recognizes her beloved. Thus, the brave and selfless Shi Yi and the beautiful and affectionate princess hold their wedding. (Attached picture)

    歌舞剧“石义砍柴”上演
    天津人民艺术剧院歌舞团，最近演出了舞剧“石义砍柴”，受到观众欢迎。
    这个舞剧是根据民间广为流传的“小白龙”神话故事改编的，共八场。砍柴郎石义正在山坡上砍柴，突然狂风大作，飞沙走石，九头鸟邪恶的魔影掠过天空，石义抛起斧头，向妖魔砍去，从空中落下了一只绣鞋……故事就从这里开始。以后在一个热闹的庙会上，宫差宣读了国王的告示：公主被九头鸟捉去，谁救了公主便将公主许配给他。勇敢善良的石义，自告奋勇接受了为民除害的告示，要去救出公主。这时，喝得酩酊大醉的王恩，怀着贪婪和侥幸的心情表示要和石义同往寻救公主。他们沿着被砍伤的妖怪的血迹，走进深山密林，找到了妖魔的洞口。这时，胆怯的王恩却让石义一人走下洞去。石义进洞后，砍死妖魔，救了公主。于是，公主爱上了勇敢无私的石义，折断金簪，以一半相赠作为爱情的信物。但公主出洞以后，王恩却夺走了公主，并且“落井下石”，将洞口用大石堵住。
    正当王恩得意地将和公主成婚时，公主的面纱忽然被风吹去，辨出了新郎不是意中人。这时，石义在群众的帮助下赶到皇宫，叙述了斩妖救公主的经过，继而取出九头鸟的羽毛作证。最后石义取出公主所赠半股金簪，公主也认出了自己的意中人，于是勇敢无私的石义和美丽多情的公主举行了婚礼。（附图片）
