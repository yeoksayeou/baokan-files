    The Desire of Korean Residents in Japan to Return Home Must Not Be Obstructed
    Commentator of This Newspaper
    The delegation of the Korean Red Cross, which was negotiating with the Japanese Red Cross delegation on the issue of the return of Korean residents in Japan to their homeland, issued a statement in Geneva on July 7, condemning the Japanese side for delaying the signing of the agreement already reached by both parties, and clearly pointed out that the Japanese authorities should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.
    The talks between the Korean and Japanese sides began in Geneva on April 13, and the work of drafting various documents of the agreement was completed on June 24; however, the Japanese delegation stated that it could only sign after obtaining the "consent" of the International Committee of the Red Cross. This behavior of the Japanese delegation is obviously a violation of international credibility. The issue of the return of Korean residents in Japan to their homeland should be resolved through consultation between the two countries concerned, Korea and Japan, and does not require the participation of a third party; in the articles of the agreement already reached by both parties, there is no mention of the agreement needing the "consent" of the International Committee of the Red Cross to be signed and take effect. The reason why the Japanese Red Cross delegation has been trying to emphasize the authority of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the affairs of the return of Korean residents in Japan during the negotiations is simply an attempt to lay the groundwork for the Japanese government and the Japanese Red Cross to evade and delay the signing of the agreement, and to shift all responsibility to the International Committee of the Red Cross when necessary. Now, the Japanese Red Cross delegation is deliberately entangling the completely different matters of the signing of the agreement between Korea and Japan and obtaining the "consent" of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is a proof. The current delay in signing the agreement by the Japanese Red Cross delegation not only infringes upon the legitimate right of more than 100,000 Korean residents in Japan who are ready to return to their homeland immediately, but also violates the agreement already reached by both parties and the principles of humanitarianism. The Chinese people fully support the statement of the Korean Red Cross delegation and believe that the Japanese authorities and the Japanese Red Cross delegation should immediately take measures to show sincerity in the issue of the return of Korean residents in Japan to their homeland.
    It should be pointed out that the practice of the Japanese Red Cross delegation is inseparable from the fundamental position of the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government to deliberately obstruct the return of Korean residents in Japan to their homeland. As everyone knows, the Kishi Nobusuke government has always disregarded the legitimate wishes of Korean residents in Japan. It not only discriminates against Korean citizens residing in Japan, depriving them of the various rights that foreign nationals should enjoy; but also has repeatedly violated the will of Korean residents and forcibly sent Korean residents who were illegally detained to South Korea. Although Kishi Nobusuke verbally admits that the return of Korean residents in Japan is a "humanitarian issue," he is actually constantly doing things that violate humanity. It tries every possible means to detain Korean residents as bargaining chips for negotiating the "normalization" of relations with the Syngman Rhee clique, and even resorts to using the police to threaten and intimidate those Korean residents who are eagerly looking forward to returning home. Since April of this year, although the Kishi Nobusuke government has begun to hold talks with the Korean side on the issue of the return of Korean residents in Japan through the Japanese Red Cross under the strong pressure of just public opinion at home and abroad; it has never given up using various destructive tricks and two-faced tactics to obstruct the progress of the talks. Especially after the two sides reached an agreement and the United States expressed great "unease" about it, the United States sent its Red Cross President Gruenther to Japan and South Korea to carry out activities to obstruct the return of Korean residents in Japan. Gruenther openly stated that "the United States opposes any weakening of the screening procedures"; the Syngman Rhee clique clamored that South Korea might use force to prevent Korean residents from returning home. As a result, the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Japanese Red Cross delegation brazenly disregarded the promises they made during the talks and delayed signing the agreement under the pretext of waiting for the "consent" of the International Committee of the Red Cross. It can be seen from this that the Japanese side's delay in signing the agreement actually has nothing to do with the attitude of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" has pointed out that the actual reason for Japan's delay in signing the agreement is that the Japanese government is "concerned" about its relations with the United States and South Korea. The Foreign Minister of the Kishi Nobusuke government, Aiichiro Fujiyama, also stated that Japan "wants to adopt a low-profile attitude to avoid stimulating" South Korea. Are these not enough to show that the real reason for Japan's evasion and delay in signing the agreement is that it lacks sincerity in repatriating Korean residents in Japan as soon as possible?
    However, no matter what kind of excuses the Japanese side uses, and no matter what the attitude of the International Committee of the Red Cross is, the legitimate right of Korean residents in Japan to return to their homeland must not be violated. According to the wishes of Korean residents in Japan, sending them back to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is an obligation that the Japanese authorities cannot escape.
    The Kishi Nobusuke government will not be able to escape the strong condemnation of world justice as long as it does not abandon its unreasonable conspiracy to obstruct the return of Korean residents in Japan.

    旅日朝侨回国的愿望不容阻挠
    本报评论员
    同日本红十字会代表团谈判旅日朝侨回国问题的朝鲜红十字会代表团，7月7日在日内瓦发表声明，谴责日本方面拖延在双方已经达成的协议上签字，并明确指出日本当局应对由此而产生的一切后果负完全责任。
    朝鲜和日本双方会谈是4月13日在日内瓦开始的，6月24日已结束了起草协议的各项文件的工作；但日本代表团竟表示只有在得到红十字国际委员会的
  “同意”后它才能签字。日本代表团的这种行为显然是违背国际信义的。旅日朝鲜侨民的回国问题，是应该由当事的朝日两国之间协商解决的问题，并不需要第三者参与；在双方已经达成的协议条文中，也没有一句话提到协议必须经红十字国际委员会的“同意”才能签字和生效。日本红十字会代表团之所以在谈判过程中竭力强调红十字国际委员会参与旅日朝侨归国事务的权限，不过是企图为日本政府和日本红十字会回避和拖延签署协议的行动埋下伏笔，在必要时把一切责任推给红十字国际委员会。现在，日本红十字会代表团故意把朝日双方签订协议和获得红十字国际委员会的“同意”这两件完全不同的事情纠缠在一起，就是一个证明。日本红十字会代表团目前拖延签署协议的结果，不仅侵犯了十多万整装待发的旅日朝鲜侨民立即返回祖国的正当权利，而且违反了双方已经达成的协议和人道主义的原则。中国人民完全支持朝鲜红十字会代表团的声明，认为日本当局和日本红十字会代表团应当立即采取措施，在使旅日朝鲜侨民归国的问题上表现诚意。
    应当指出，日本红十字会代表团的做法，是与日本岸信介政府蓄意阻挠旅日朝鲜侨民回国的根本立场分不开的。大家知道，岸信介政府一向无视旅日朝鲜侨民的正当愿望。它不仅歧视居住日本的朝鲜公民，使他们不能享有外侨所应享有的各项权利；而且曾不止一次地违反朝鲜侨民的意志，把被非法拘留的朝鲜侨民，强迫遣送到南朝鲜去。岸信介尽管在口头上承认旅日朝侨归国是“人道问题”，实际上却不断做出违反人道的事情。它千方百计企图把朝鲜侨民扣留下来作为同李承晚集团谈判关系“正常化”的讨价还价的资本，甚至不惜动用警察威胁和恐吓那些迫切盼望回国的朝鲜侨民。今年4月以来，岸信介政府虽然慑于国内外公正舆论的强大压力，开始通过日本红十字会就旅日朝侨归国的问题同朝鲜方面会谈；但始终没有放弃使用种种破坏伎俩和表里不一的两面手法，阻挠会谈的进展。特别是在双方达成协议和美国对此表示极大的“不安”以后，美国派它的红十字会会长格仑瑟到日本和南朝鲜进行阻挠旅日朝鲜侨民归国的活动。格仑瑟公开表明“美国反对对甄别手续的任何削弱”；李承晚集团则叫嚷南朝鲜可能用武力阻止朝侨回国。于是岸信介政府和日本红十字会代表团悍然不顾他们在会谈期间所作的诺言，以所谓等待红十字国际委员会的“同意”为借口而拖延在协议上签字。由此可见，日本方面拖延签署协议，实际上同红十字国际委员会的态度无关。日本“读卖新闻”已指出，日本拖延签署协议的实际原因是日本政府“顾虑”同美国和南朝鲜的关系。岸信介政府的外务大臣藤山爱一郎也表示日本对南朝鲜“想采取低姿势的避免刺激的态度”。这些难道还不足以说明日本回避和拖延签署协议的真正原因在于它没有诚意及早遣返旅日朝侨吗？
    然而，不论日本方面采用什么样的借口，也不论红十字国际委员会的态度如何，旅日朝鲜侨民返回祖国的正当权利是不容侵犯的。根据旅日朝鲜侨民的愿望，遣送他们回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，是日本当局不可逃避的义务。
    岸信介政府一天不放弃它无理阻挠旅日朝侨归国的阴谋，便一天不能逃避世界公正舆论的强烈谴责。
