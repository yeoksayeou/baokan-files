Let Life Be Full of Poetry and Painting
By Zhou Yongkang, Our Staff Reporter

One afternoon this spring, more than fifty people suddenly poured into the enamelware department of the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store. They surrounded the counter, pointing and looking for a long time, but didn't buy a single thing. It turned out that this group of customers who only looked and didn't buy were employees of the Shanghai Jiuxin Enamel Factory. Among them were spray-painting workers, plate-making workers, art personnel, and cadres from various workshops. Leading this visiting group was Fu Zuorong, the Party Branch Secretary of the Jiuxin Factory. They used their rest time that day to see if their factory's products were popular.

Why did the leaders of Jiuxin Factory organize such a visit? The story is as follows: The factory produced many new designs of washbasins last year, but in an industry-wide appraisal at the beginning of this year, they fell behind other enamel factories and did not receive the red flag. When people in the factory heard this news, some were very anxious and asked the leaders to investigate the reasons for the backwardness; but some people thought: anyway, washbasins are selling well now, no matter what the design, people will want them. The implication was: output is the most important thing, and designs don't matter. How to unify everyone's understanding of designs? The leaders of Jiuxin Factory decided not to start a discussion with everyone, but to organize a group of employees to go to Shanghai's largest department store to broaden their horizons and listen to other people's opinions.

This visit to the No. 1 Department Store made the faces of the more than fifty employees of the Jiuxin Factory turn red.

They first went to the new design display area, where nearly a hundred new washbasins were on display, each one bright and eye-catching, but not one of them was a product of Jiuxin Factory. Then they went to the area selling washbasins and found only two kinds of Jiuxin Factory products among more than two hundred kinds of washbasins. Compared with the washbasins of several brother factories next to them, the designs appeared rigid and monotonous, and the colors were not bright. The more everyone looked, the more uncomfortable they felt. Several people shook their heads while looking and said, "We wouldn't even want such a washbasin for ourselves, how can we expect others to like it?" When the salespersons heard that they were employees of the Jiuxin Factory, they said to them, "When customers buy enamelware, the first thing they look at is whether the design is good, the second is whether the body is strong, and the third is the price. Because the designs of your Jiuxin Factory's washbasins are monotonous, few people have bought them recently. Only when the new designs of other factories are sold out will people buy yours." The employees of Jiuxin Factory felt really bad after hearing these words.

The next day, the Party Branch held a symposium with this group of employees. Without hesitation, everyone unanimously proposed to make the washbasin designs undergo a transformation before the "May Day" holiday. They immediately established a new design research group, led by Shen Shuidong, a technician who had started as a spray-painting worker.

The idea of increasing new varieties was clear, but where to find designs? At that time, the factory only had one art staff member, and even if he painted non-stop all day, he could not produce a single design in a day, and it was hard to say whether it would be good or not. The factory leaders then convened a staff meeting to mobilize all employees to find designs. Suddenly, the entire factory was buzzing. The factory's club was not very big to begin with, and these days it was packed with people during breaks. Some flipped through newly published画报 (Pictorials), some checked old magazines, and found the pictures and photos on the covers, illustrations, and painting pages to provide to the research group. Some workers were afraid that the factory's books and magazines were not enough, so they took the time to run to bookstores and newsstands to find them.

A plate-making worker named Zhang Songcan had his left leg amputated from childhood and wore an artificial leg, which made it very inconvenient for him to move around. One day, he went to the hospital to see a doctor, and when he saw a bookstore on the way, he dragged his heavy artificial leg and walked in to see if there were any suitable pictures. When he was about to reach the hospital, he saw a newly published "Meng Ya" (Sprouts) magazine in a newsstand. The cover was printed with a woodcut entitled "Newly Bought Books," which was very beautiful, so he bought a copy. After seeing the doctor, he couldn't wait to rush back. When everyone saw it, they all praised it. This is the first new design adopted by Jiuxin Factory this time, and it is also the first new attempt in the Shanghai enamel industry to put woodcuts on washbasins. When the old worker Wang Zipeng was reading the newspaper, he suddenly thought that since photos could be printed in the newspaper, could they also be printed on washbasins? Moreover, he had heard that the Xi'an Enamel Factory had already made such washbasins, and he was eager to try it himself. However, he was a layman when it came to photography. So he rushed to a photo studio to find one of his younger brothers to discuss it with him. With the help of his brother, the experiment of printing photos on washbasins was also successful. In order to find more landscape and bird patterns, Shen Shuidong, the leader of the group, ran to the Chinese Painting Academy for many days in a row. The painters also painted fifteen new paintings for the Jiuxin Factory in their busy schedules. In just a few days, the research group received a large number of new design materials. After careful selection, by the eve of "May Day," the factory had trial-produced more than eighty kinds of lovely new washbasins. The designs have increased from only two kinds of watercolor paintings and Chinese paintings in the past to twelve kinds such as woodcuts, photography, relief, and prints.

Not long ago, in order to solicit the opinions of brother factories and commercial departments and further expand the designs, Jiuxin Factory held a new design exhibition in the factory. Walking into this exhibition, you could see colorful and vibrant scenes, as if you had entered a big garden where a hundred flowers were blooming. The washbasin printed with the woodcut "Newly Bought Books" was irresistible. The washbasin was surrounded by a layer of powder blue, from deep to light, with a rural girl wearing a blue skirt in the middle, with two bamboo baskets beside her, holding a carrying pole in one hand and attentively reading a newly bought book. The picture and colors are beautiful and pleasing to the eye. Many landscape paintings, streamlined trains, new-style ships and other patterns are also very novel in style. In a corner of the exhibition, there was also a perfumed washbasin, which would emit a burst of jasmine fragrance when the hot water cooled down. Not long after the end of the exhibition, they continued their efforts and printed the famous flowers of the twelve months of China on the washbasins in late June.

Perhaps some people will say that increasing the variety of designs of enamel products is nothing more than changing the designs, and there is not necessarily any difficulty in production. That's not how you can say it. A few days ago, I saw a newly designed pattern here, "Yue Fei Spears Xiao Liangwang". This pattern used a total of twenty sets of base plates and more than ten colors, which took twice as long as usual. In people's minds, the lines on enamel washbasins are always very thick; in order to make the picture realistic, the workers of Jiuxin Factory engraved many lines on ships and trains that were almost as thin as lines drawn with a pen. To achieve this, not only the engravers had to be meticulous, but also the spray-painting workers had to spray very carefully. The increase in designs did have some impact on the output of Jiuxin Factory, but the workers said: "We are making works of art for consumers, letting people's lives be full of poetry and painting, and it is worth spending more effort." Since they spent more effort, they tried to compress working hours from other aspects. A set of external flower spraying machines that the factory recently successfully tested has more than doubled the efficiency compared to manual work.

Now, Jiuxin Factory's washbasins have appeared on the market in a different posture. We might as well go to Shanghai No. 1 Department Store to take a look. Here, Jiuxin Factory's new products are still not very numerous at times, but this is because their new designs are favored by customers as soon as they arrive here and are often sold out. However, in the new design display area, where only exhibitions are held and no sales are made, the new washbasins of Jiuxin Factory often account for more than half.

    让生活充满诗情画意

    今年春天的一个下午，上海第一百货商店的搪瓷用品部里，突然涌进来五十多个人。他们围住柜台指指点点地看了好久，却一样东西也没有买。原来，这批只看不买的顾客，是上海久新搪瓷厂的职工。其中有喷花工人，制版工人，美术人员，还有各车间的干部，带领这个访问团的，是久新厂的党总支书记傅作荣。他们利用这天休息的时间，来看看自己厂的产品受不受人欢迎。
    久新厂领导方面为什么要组织这样一次访问呢？事情的由来是这样的：这个厂去年生产了不少新花色的面盆，可是在今年年初的一次全行业评比中，他们却落在别的搪瓷厂后面，没有得到红旗。厂里的人一听到这个消息，有的很着急，要求领导方面研究一下落后原因；但是也有人认为：反正现在面盆销路好，不管什么花色，都有人要。意思是：产量最重要，花色品种无所谓。怎样来统一大家对花色品种的认识呢？久新厂领导人员决定先不去发动大家讨论，而是组织一批职工到上海最大的百货商店去开开眼界，听听别人的意见。
    到第一百货商店这一看，可把久新厂五十多个职工的脸都看红了。
    他们先看新花样专柜，这里一共陈列着近百只新面盆，个个鲜艳夺目，可是内中没有一只是久新厂的产品。再到卖面盆的地方去找，在两百多种面盆中只找到两种久新厂的产品，同旁边几个兄弟厂的面盆比起来，显得花样呆板单调，色彩也不鲜艳。大家越看心里越不舒畅，有几个人一边看一边摇头说：“这样的面盆，自己看看也不要，怎能叫别人喜欢呢？”旁边的营业员一听他们是久新厂的职工，便对他们说：“顾客买搪瓷用品，第一看花色好不好，第二再看身骨牢不牢，第三才问价钱贵不贵。你们久新厂的面盆因为花色单调，近来很少有人买。除非别的厂的新花样卖完了，才买你们的。”久新厂的职工听了这些话真不是滋味。
    第二天，党总支找这批职工开了个座谈会。大家没有二话，一致提出要在“五一”节以前让面盆花样翻个身。他们当场成立了一个新花样研究小组，由喷花工人出身的技术人员沈水东担任组长。
    增加新品种的思想是明确了，可是从哪里去找花样呢？厂里当时只有一个美术人员，即使他整天不停地画，一天也画不出一个花样，好不好还很难说。工厂领导方面接着召开了一次职工大会，动员全厂职工人人动手寻找花样。这下子，整个厂沸腾起来了。厂里的俱乐部本来就不大，这些天一到休息的时候，人都挤得满满的。有的翻刚出版的画报，有的查过了期的杂志，把上面的封面、插图、画页上的图画和照片找了出来，提供给研究小组。有的工人怕厂里书报杂志不够多，还抽空跑到书店、报摊去找。
    有一个叫章松灿的刻花制版工人，他的左腿从小截去，装了一个假腿，行动很不方便。有一天，他去医院看病，路上一看见有书店，就拖着沉重的假腿走进去，看有没有合适的图画。快到医院时，他在一个书亭里看到一本刚出版的“萌芽”杂志，封面上印着一幅题目叫“刚买来的新书”的木刻，非常好看，便买了一本。他看完病，迫不及待地赶回来。大家一看，果然人人赞赏。这就是久新厂这次采用的第一个新花样，也是上海搪瓷业第一次把木刻搬上面盆的新尝试。老工人王子鹏在看报时，突然想到照片既然能印在报上，能不能也把它印到面盆上去呢？而且听说西安搪瓷厂已经做过这样的面盆，他心里也跃跃欲试。可是，照相这玩艺儿，自己是一个门外汉。他便赶到一家照相馆去找他的一个弟弟商量。在他弟弟的帮助下，把照片印上面盆的试验也成功了。担任组长的沈水东为了寻找更多的山水花鸟图案，接连好多天都跑国画院。画家们也在百忙之中给久新厂画了十五幅新画。没有几天功夫，研究小组就收到了一大批新画样资料。经过精心挑选，到“五一”前夕，这个厂就试制出八十多种惹人喜爱的新面盆。花样从过去只有水彩画、国画两种，增加到木刻、摄影、浮雕、版画等十二种。
    前不久，久新厂为了听取兄弟厂和商业部门的意见，进一步扩大花色，在厂里举办了一个新花样展览会。走进这个展览会，只见彩色缤纷，万紫千红，好像走进了一座百花齐放的大花园。印着“刚买来的新书”木刻的面盆令人爱不释手。面盆周围是一层由深入浅的粉蓝色，中间一个身上围着蓝裙子的农村姑娘，身边放着两只竹篮子，一边拿着扁担，一边正在聚精会神地读一本刚买来的新书。画面和色彩优美悦目。许多山水风景画、流线型列车、新型轮船等图案，式样也很新颖。展览会的一角，还放着一只香水面盆，热水冷下去，就会散发出一阵阵茉莉花香味。展览会结束后不久，他们再接再厉，在6月下旬又把我国十二月名花印上了面盆。
    或许有人会说，搪瓷品增加花色品种，无非是翻翻花样而已，生产上不见得会有什么困难。话可不能这样说。前几天，我在这里看了一个刚设计出来的新花样“岳飞枪挑小梁王”。这一个花样，他们一共用了二十套底版，十多种颜色，比平时要多花一倍的时间。在人们印象中，搪瓷面盆上的线条总是粗得很；久新厂工人为了使画面逼真，把轮船、火车上的许多线条刻得几乎和钢笔划的线差不多细。要做到这一点，不但刻画工人要精工细雕，喷花工人也要喷得非常细心。花样的增多，也确实使久新厂的产量受到些影响，可是工人们说：“我们是在给消费者制造美术品，让人们的生活充满诗情画意，多花些功夫也是值得的。”功夫花多了，他们想办法从别的方面来压缩工时。最近厂里试验成功的一套喷外花的机器，效率比手工提高了一倍多。
    现在，久新厂的面盆以另一种姿态在市场上出现了。我们不妨也到上海第一百货公司去看看。在这里，久新厂的新产品有时仍然不多，但这是因为他们的新花样一到这里就被顾客们看中，常常销售一空。但是在只展览不出售的新花样专柜里，久新厂的新面盆常常要占到一半以上。
