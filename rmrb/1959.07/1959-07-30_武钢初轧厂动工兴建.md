Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 29th: Construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's primary rolling mill began on the 28th.

On the morning of the 28th, workers held a grand commencement ceremony on the newly leveled construction site of the primary rolling mill. The workers building the primary rolling mill treated it like a joyous occasion, planting dozens of colored flags around the site and posting pledges and resolutions. When Li Yiqing, Secretary of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Party Committee and General Manager, cut the red ribbon, the primary rolling mill officially commenced construction. The rolling steel system is the last production system of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation to begin construction, and the start of the primary rolling mill marks the beginning of construction for all of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's production systems.

The Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's primary rolling mill is designed with Soviet assistance and will possess world-class large-scale primary rolling machines. From receiving steel ingots to sending out steel billets, the entire process will be automated. Workers only need to operate the controller on the control panel, and the large, fiery red steel ingots will be rolled into steel billets of various sizes.

The construction scale of the primary rolling mill is enormous, with the factory building being equivalent to a seven-story building in height. In the past three months, various units of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation have arranged construction forces, built temporary facilities such as water and electricity, roads, and sheds required for construction, excavated the foundation pit for the factory building, processed some steel bars and steel components, and transported 77% of the equipment, creating various conditions for the commencement of construction. The construction workers have also repeatedly studied the favorable conditions and difficulties of the construction, proposing that the construction of the primary rolling mill should meet the requirements of good quality, fast speed, and low cost.

    武钢初轧厂动工兴建
    新华社武汉29日电　武汉钢铁公司的初轧厂在28日动工兴建。
    28日上午，职工们在刚平整好的初轧厂工地上，举行了隆重的开工典礼。建设初轧厂的工人像办喜事一样，在四周插上了几十面彩旗，贴出了保证书和决心书。当武钢党委书记兼总经理李一清剪开红色的彩绸后，初轧厂便正式兴工。轧钢系统是武钢最后动工的一个生产系统，初轧厂的动工，便标志着武钢所有的生产系统都已动工建设了。
    武钢初轧厂是苏联帮助设计的，它将拥有世界上第一流的大型初轧机，从接受钢锭到送出钢坯都将是自动化操纵。工人只要在操纵台上操纵控制器，粗大火红的钢锭，就会被轧成各种尺寸的钢坯。
    初轧厂的建设规模巨大，厂房相当于七层楼房高。最近3个月以来，武钢各单位安排好了施工力量，修建了施工需用的水电、道路、工棚等临时性设施，挖好了厂房基坑，加工了部分钢筋及钢构件，运到了77％的设备，给动工兴建创造了各种条件。建设工人们还反复研究了施工的有利条件和困难，提出要使初轧厂的建设达到质量好、速度快、成本低的要求。
