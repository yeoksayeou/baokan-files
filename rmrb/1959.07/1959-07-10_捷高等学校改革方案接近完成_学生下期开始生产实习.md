Xinhua News Agency, Prague -- The preparatory work for the reform of higher education in Czechoslovakia, after about a year of publicity, deliberation, and key experiments, is now nearing completion. The reform plan will be implemented starting in the upcoming new semester.

This reform of higher education is being carried out in accordance with the policy of combining education with productive labor and closely linking schools with life, as proposed by the Eleventh Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Czech Communist Party held in April emphasized that this reform of higher education is not merely a change in teaching methods, but a profound political and ideological transformation. The aim of the reform is to cultivate working-class intellectuals who possess both high political consciousness and communist morality, as well as high cultural attainments and labor knowledge.

According to this policy, Czechoslovak higher education institutions have formulated specific reform plans based on their respective situations. For example, the Pilsen College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering stipulates that first and second-year students spend one week out of every two weeks interning at the famous Lenin Factory, assigned to relevant workshops as apprentices according to their chosen major. The factory has a special committee responsible for the students' internships, and the factory's trade union organization will also cultivate their ability to participate in production management and engage in social activities. After two years, the school and the factory will jointly assess the students' internship performance. Students who pass the examination and obtain a technician's certificate will be able to advance to the third year of study. After continuing their studies at the school for two and a half years, they will return to the factory for the final semester to complete their graduation design.

The Prague Institute of Chemical Technology stipulates that students spend the first three years studying theory at the school while also participating in some voluntary labor. Then, they will participate in a one-year production internship at a factory. After passing the internship examination, they will enter the fourth year. The Liberec College of Mechanical Engineering will establish its own production workshop, where students will intern for the first three years to master production skills, so that by the last two years of their studies, they will have the ability to work independently.

Agricultural students will mainly intern at agricultural production cooperatives. For example, the Prague University of Agriculture stipulates that fourth-year students have four months of production internship, and fifth-year students have three weeks of production management internship, to help cooperatives formulate annual production plans.

Students of economics, law, literature, history, and other liberal arts colleges will also engage in various types of socially beneficial productive labor. (Attached picture)

    捷高等学校改革方案接近完成
    学生下期开始生产实习
    据新华社布拉格讯　捷克斯洛伐克高等学校教育改革的准备工作经过一年左右时间的宣传、酝酿和重点试验，现在已接近完成，改革方案将从即将到来的新学年开始实行。
    这次高等学校教育改革是根据捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会所提出的教育同生产劳动相结合、学校紧密与生活相联系的方针进行的。今年4月间召开的捷共中央全会曾强调指出，这次对高等教育的改革不单是教学方式方法上的改变，而且是一次政治上和思想上的深刻变化。改革的目的是培养既具有高度政治觉悟和共产主义道德，又具有高度文化素养和劳动知识的工人阶级知识分子。
    根据这一方针，捷克斯洛伐克高等院校按照各自的情况拟订了改革的具体方案。如彼尔森机械和电气工程学院规定，一、二年级的学生每两周中有一周在著名的列宁工厂实习，按照他们所选择的专业分配到有关车间充当学徒。工厂设有专门委员会负责学生们的实习，工厂工会组织还将培养他们参与生产管理和从事社会活动的能力。两年期满后，学校和工厂将共同评定学生们的实习成绩。考试合格并获得技工证书的学生才能升入三年级学习。他们继续在学校攻读两年半后，最后一个学期，还要回到工厂完成自己的毕业设计。
    布拉格化工学院规定，学生们头三年在校学习理论，同时参加一些义务劳动。然后到工厂生产实习一年，通过实习考试后，再进入四年级。里贝律茨机械学院则将建立自己的生产工场，学生们前三年在工场实习，掌握生产技能，这样到学习的最后两年时，他们已具有独立工作的能力。
    农学院的学生将主要去农业生产合作社实习。如布拉格农业大学规定，四年级学生有四个月的生产实习，五年级学生有三周的生产管理实习，用来帮助合作社制订全年生产计划等。
    经济、法律、文学、历史等文法学院的学生也将从事各种对社会有益的生产劳动。（附图片）
