    Dezhou Watermelon Production Increased by 20% Compared to Last Year
    The nationally famous Shandong Dezhou watermelon has had another bumper harvest this year. The estimated output will reach more than 20 million jin, an increase of 20% to 30% compared to last year.
    Watermelon is a specialty of Dezhou and has always sold well in the domestic market. There are many varieties of Dezhou watermelon. The main varieties planted this year include more than ten excellent varieties such as Laba melon, Caohuangrang, Shuanghuangrang, Liuye Qing, Hei Shoujin Tiao, and Sanjieyi. These melons are characterized by their large size, thin skin, sweet and fragrant flesh. The Laba melon is the most delicious. This melon is long and pillow-shaped, large in size with a relatively thick skin, fine flesh without filaments, and honey-sweet taste, which is very popular among consumers.
    In order to meet the needs of urban and rural people, Dezhou City expanded the watermelon planting area by more than 4,400 mu this year. The Dezhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also strengthened specific leadership over watermelon production. The people's communes have also established specialized teams, adopting methods such as contracted responsibility areas to strengthen field management of watermelons. Now the watermelons are ripe and on the market, being transported to Beijing, Jinan, Tianjin, Shanghai, Harbin and other places to supply the urban people.

    德州西瓜比去年增产二成
    全国著名的山东德州西瓜，今年又获得丰收，预计产量可达两千多万斤，比去年增产两成到三成。
    西瓜是德州的特产，历年来畅销国内市场。德州西瓜品种很多。今年种植的主要有喇叭瓜、草黄瓤、双黄瓤、柳叶青、黑手巾条、三结义等十多种优良品种。这些瓜的特点是：个大、皮薄、瓤甜味香，其中以喇叭瓜最好吃。这种瓜长枕形，个大皮较厚，瓤细无丝、蜜甜，很受广大消费者欢迎。
    为了满足城乡人民的需要，德州市今年扩大了西瓜播种面积四千四百余亩，中共德州市委还加强了西瓜生产的具体领导。各人民公社也都成立了专业队，采取分片包干等办法，加强了西瓜的田间管理。现在西瓜已成熟登市，陆续运往北京、济南、天津、上海、哈尔滨等地，供城市人民食用。
