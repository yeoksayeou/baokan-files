Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: Over 20,000 workers temporarily transferred from factories and construction enterprises in the capital, responding to the call of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee to help vegetable farmers complete the autumn vegetable sowing task in a timely manner, have successively gone to the countryside to help plant vegetables; some factories producing machinery and pesticides for vegetable farmers are also stepping up the production of mechanical equipment and pesticides to support vegetable farmers in their production.

Producing a large quantity of autumn vegetables is the key to ensuring that the people of Beijing have vegetables to eat for six months this winter and next spring. This year, the planned planting area for autumn vegetables in the suburbs of the capital has increased significantly, especially for Chinese cabbage, which will be sown on more than 200,000 mu, more than double the area planted last year. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee have long made arrangements for this year's autumn vegetable sowing, and recently taken measures to organize forces from both urban and rural areas to strive to over fulfill the sowing plan.

In order to transfer manpower to support the fraternal farmers in developing vegetable production, all factories, mines, and construction enterprises in the city have actively adjusted shifts and improved labor organization, squeezing out labor to support the rural areas while ensuring the great leap forward in industrial production. The workers who went to the countryside were in high spirits. After arriving at their work locations, they ate, lived, and worked with their farmer brothers, and immediately joined the battle. Many workers who understood mechanical repair technology also helped the farmer brothers master and repair irrigation and sowing machinery.

More than 20 factories in the city producing irrigation and drainage machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides for rural areas are carrying out a campaign to increase production and practice economy, striving to produce more products for rural areas in the third quarter. The Chenguang Pesticide Factory will increase the production of various pesticides by 20% in July compared to the original plan. Tongyi Water Pump Factory, the largest producer of water pumps in the city, has produced 808 agricultural pumps in the first half of the year, and will manufacture another 112 water pumps to supply the suburbs in the third quarter. Recently, employees of the Beijing Power Supply Bureau, together with electricians from various communes and farms, installed 261 electric irrigation equipment for rural areas and overhauled 70 transformers. The city's food, fur, and grain processing departments have successively transported some by-products and scraps that can be used as fertilizer to the suburbs. The municipal and district transportation departments have also made timely arrangements in terms of transportation capacity, and the various fertilizers transported to various communes and farms in the suburbs from June to now have reached 40 million jin.

With the support of industry and the help of workers, the confidence of commune members in the suburbs to complete the autumn vegetable sowing task and ensure the supply of vegetables to the city has been further enhanced. Some districts, communes, and farms have established organizations to lead autumn vegetable production, and some communes have launched a "five check" campaign to check land plots, water sources, fertilizers, seeds, and irrigation and drainage machinery, to further tap potential, identify problems, and make the vegetable production plan more active and reliable.

    首都职工支援郊区多种秋菜
    各工厂调二万多人下乡　加紧生产大批机械农药
    新华社26日讯　首都各工厂和建筑企业临时抽调的两万多名职工，响应中共北京市委和市人民委员会帮助菜农及时完成秋菜播种任务的号召，已经陆续下乡帮助种菜；一些为菜农生产机械、农药的工厂也在加紧生产机械设备和农药，支援菜农进行生产。
    大量生产秋菜是保证北京市全市人民今冬明春六个月吃菜的关键问题。今年首都郊区秋菜计划种植面积增加很多，特别是大白菜将播种二十多万亩，较去年增加两倍多。中共北京市委和市人民委员会对今年的秋菜播种，早就作了安排，最近又采取措施，从城乡两方面组织力量，力争超额完成播种计划。
    全市各厂矿建筑企业为了抽调人力支援农民兄弟发展蔬菜生产，都积极调整了班次，改善了劳动组织，在保证工业生产大跃进的前提下，挤出劳力支援农村。到农村去的工人情绪高涨，他们到达劳动地点以后，和农民兄弟同吃同住同劳动，并且立即投入了战斗。不少懂得机械修理技术的工人，还帮助农民兄弟们掌握和修理排灌、播种机械。
    全市二十多家为农村生产排灌机械、肥料、农药的工厂正在开展增产节约运动，力争第三季度为农村生产更多的产品。晨光农药厂7月份各种农药将比原订计划增产20％。全市生产水泵最多的同益水泵厂，上半年已生产了八百零八台农业用泵，第三季度还将再制造一百一十二台水泵供应郊区。北京供电局的职工最近和各公社、农场的电工一起，为农村安装了二百六十一台电力灌溉设备，检修了七十台变压器。全市食品、皮毛和粮食加工部门已经把一些可用作肥料的副产品、下脚料等，陆续运往郊区。市、区交通运输部门在运输力方面也及时作了安排，仅6月份到现在运到郊区各公社、农场的各种肥料，就达四千万斤。
    有了工业的支援、工人的帮助，郊区社员完成秋菜播种任务、保证城市蔬菜供应的信心更增强了。有些区、社、农场成立了领导秋菜生产的机构，有的公社开展了查地块、查水源、查肥料、查籽种、查排灌机械的“五查”运动，进一步挖掘潜力、摸清问题，使蔬菜生产计划更加积极可靠。
