Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 24th: The so-called "International Commission of Jurists" today issued a report in Geneva that grossly slanders the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion in the Tibet region. In its report, this commission advocated that the United Nations should interfere in the already-suppressed Tibetan rebellion, which is purely China's internal affair.

This commission, which has so-called "consultative status" in the United Nations, is composed of "jurists" from twenty countries, including the United States, India, Japan, and Pakistan. It is notorious for drafting a report that defamed the Hungarian government's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots.

The report, which was released today and is 208 pages long, is filled with slanderous remarks against the Chinese government and absurd attempts to separate Tibet from China. It stubbornly describes Tibet, a part of China's sacred territory, as "an independent nation," and the 1951 agreement between the Central Government of China and the local government of Tibet on the peaceful liberation of Tibet as an "international agreement." It also falsely accuses the Chinese central government of "violating the 1951 agreement."

In its report, the commission fabricated many lies, claiming that the Chinese Communists "engaged in indiscriminate slaughter" in Tibet and that "there is a systematic conspiracy to eliminate the distinct national, cultural, and religious life of Tibet."

In its "report," the commission fabricated "arguments" for interfering in China's internal affairs, saying that the Tibet issue "is not only an internal issue between Tibet and China" but also "a matter of the survival of a member of the international family." It advocated that the United Nations should "fully investigate this case."

    “国际法学家委员会”不守国际法
    竟诬蔑我国平息西藏叛乱
    新华社24日讯　日内瓦消息：所谓“国际法学家委员会”今天在日内瓦发表了一项大肆诬蔑中国政府平息西藏地区叛乱事件的报告。这个委员会在报告中鼓吹由联合国出面对已经平息的，纯属中国内政的西藏叛乱事件进行干涉。
    这个在联合国中有所谓“谘询资格”的委员会是由美国、印度、日本、巴基斯坦等二十个国家的“法学家”组成的。它由于起草过诽谤匈牙利政府镇压反革命暴乱的报告而臭名远扬。
    这个委员会今天发表的这项长达二百零八页的报告充满了诬蔑中国政府和企图把西藏从中国分裂出去的荒诞言论。它硬把中国神圣领土的一部分——西藏说成是“一个独立国家”，把中国中央政府1951年同西藏地方政府签订的和平解放西藏的协议说成是“国际协定”，并且颠倒黑白地诬蔑中国中央政府
  “违反了1951年的协议”。
    这个委员会在报告中凭空捏造了许多谎言，说什么中国共产党人
  “在西藏滥施屠杀”，在西藏“存在着一个有系统的要消灭西藏单独存在的民族、文化和宗教生活的阴谋”。
    这个委员会在“报告”中为干涉中国内政制造“论据”说，西藏问题“不仅是一个西藏和中国之间的内部问题”，而是“国际大家庭中的一个成员的生存问题”。它鼓吹由联合国来“充分调查这个案件”。
