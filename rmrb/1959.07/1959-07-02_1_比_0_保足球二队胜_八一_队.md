Xinhua News Agency, July 1st: The Bulgarian national football team's second team defeated the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August First" football team today in Beijing by a score of 1-0, despite the rain.

The Bulgarian team, which played aggressively in ball-winning and rapidly in passing, only broke through the "August First" team's strong defensive line in the last seven minutes of the ninety-minute match. At that time, the Bulgarian team was besieging the "August First" team's goal. Left winger Kochev dodged "August First" team right back Li Shuntai and ran to a position 18 meters in front of the "August First" team's goal. He accurately aimed at the ball passed from the right by right inside forward Karadzheriyev and shot it straight into the goal defended by Huang Zhaowen.

Although it was drizzling at the beginning of the match, and the field and the ball were slippery, the competition between the two sides was still very intense. More than 20,000 spectators wearing raincoats or hiding under umbrellas applauded from time to time for the wonderful performances of both teams.

The Bulgarian team's offense today far exceeded that of the "August First" team. In particular, because their interception ability was very strong, the "August First" team's offense, which often involved excessive dribbling, was often destroyed just after crossing the midline, so that the "August First" team was on the defensive for most of the time. However, under the frequent attacks of the Bulgarian team, the "August First" team's defenders and goalkeeper made persistent interceptions, headers, and saves, preventing the Bulgarian team from scoring in the first eighty-three minutes of the match. The "August First" team was later penetrated by the visiting team for the winning goal due to a gap appearing on the right side of their defense.

    1比0——保足球二队胜“八一”队
    据新华社1日讯　保加利亚国家足球队第二队今天在北京冒雨以一比零战胜了中国人民解放军“八一”足球队。
    抢球积极、传球快速的保加利亚队，今天在全场九十分钟的比赛剩下最后七分钟的时候，才攻破了“八一”队的坚强防御线。当时，保加利亚队正在围攻“八一”队球门，左边锋科切夫闪过“八一”队右后卫李顺泰，跑到“八一”队球门前十八公尺处，他看准了右内锋卡拉杰里耶夫从右边传来的球，一下子就射入了黄肇文把守的球门。
    尽管球赛开始时下着小雨，球场和球都很滑，但双方争夺仍然十分激烈，两万多名穿着雨衣或躲在雨伞下观看球赛的观众，不时为两队的精采表演而鼓掌。
    保加利亚队今天的攻势大大超过了“八一”队，特别是由于他们截球能力非常强，使得带球过多的“八一”队的攻势，常常刚过中线就遭到破坏，以致“八一”队大部分时间都处在守势。但是，在保加利亚队的频繁攻势下，“八一”的几个后卫和守门员以顽强的截球、顶球和扑球动作，使得保加利亚队在前八十三分钟的比赛中一无所获。“八一”队后来由于右后方出现了漏洞，才被客队踢入了致胜的一球。
