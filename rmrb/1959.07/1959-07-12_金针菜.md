    Daylily

    Daylily, also known as yellow flower vegetable, is a very good special dried vegetable. It has a wide sales market in China, and some are exported to Southeast Asia and other places.

    Daylily is a perennial plant with strong adaptability, cultivated in both the north and south of China. The main producing areas of daylily in China are northern Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hunan and other provinces. Among them, the quality of those produced in Suqian, Huaiyang and other places is better.

    The flowering period of daylily is generally between June and July. Both spring and autumn can be used for division propagation. Daylilies divided in autumn survive in the same year, and grow vigorously in the following spring, which is better than those divided in spring.

    金针菜又叫黄花菜，是一种很好的特产干菜，国内销路很广，也有部分出口远销南洋等地。
    黄花菜是多年生宿根植物，适应性很强，南北各地都有栽培。我国黄花菜的主要产区是江苏苏北，山东，河南、湖南等省。其中以宿迁，淮阳等地生产的品质较好。
    黄花菜花期一般在六、七月间，春秋两季都能分株繁殖。秋季分株的黄花菜，当年成活，第二年春季生长茂盛，比春季分株的较好。
