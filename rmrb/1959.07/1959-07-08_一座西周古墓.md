A Western Zhou Ancient Tomb

A Western Zhou ancient tomb was discovered at a construction site in Tunxi City, Anhui Province. This ancient tomb dates back approximately three thousand years. After being cleared by personnel dispatched by the Anhui Provincial Cultural Bureau, the tomb chamber measured 8.8 meters long from east to west and 4.4 meters wide. The tomb floor was entirely paved with river pebbles. The eastern portion of the tomb chamber contained funerary objects such as bronzes and glazed pottery. There were eighteen bronze items, including musical instruments, food vessels, drinking vessels, and decorative items. The glazed pottery consisted mainly of *zun*, *dou*, bowls, and *fou*, with the pottery *zun* being the most distinctive. These glazed pottery pieces were all made of gray pottery, fired at a high temperature, and featured very fine patterns. Fragments of vermilion lacquerware were also found in the tomb chamber. Based on these findings, it is believed that this tomb may have belonged to someone of high rank.

The discovery of this ancient tomb and the unearthed cultural relics holds significant value for archaeological and historical research. Currently, the Anhui Provincial Cultural Bureau and relevant departments in Tunxi City are continuing the excavation. (Attached picture)

    一座西周古墓
    安徽省屯溪市基建工地上，发掘出一座西周古墓。这座古墓，距今约有三千年的时间，经过安徽省文化局派人清理，墓室东西长八点八公尺，阔四点四公尺。墓底全用河卵石平铺。墓室靠东部分，摆有青铜器和釉陶等殉葬品。青铜器有十八件，其中包括乐器、食器、饮器和装饰品等件。釉陶以尊、豆、碗和瓿占多数，尤以陶尊为最有特色。这些釉陶均是灰陶、火候很高，花纹很细。墓室中并发现珠红色的漆器残片。根据判断，这个古墓可能是一个有爵位的墓穴。
    这座古墓和出土文物的发现，对于考古和历史的研究，都有着很大的价值。现在，安徽省文化局和屯溪市有关部门，正在继续发掘。（附图片）
