Watermelons and sesame seeds are clearly different in size. Thus, some people use them as a metaphor for the primary and secondary aspects of work, referring to important issues, aspects, or parts of work as "watermelons," and minor issues or trivial tasks as "sesame seeds."

"Watermelons" naturally must be held onto first; but "sesame seeds" cannot be discarded either.

Vegetables, oil, sauce, vinegar, pepper, needles, thread, scissors, bowls, ladles, chopsticks, brooms, mops...etc., compared to steel, grain, cotton, coal, machinery, etc., are naturally "sesame seeds." However, our Party Central Committee has always attached great importance to them. Recently, a meeting was even held in Shanghai to discuss and arrange the production of non-staple foods and handicrafts. Why? The reason is simple. The people need these "sesame seeds." Therefore, they are placed on the agenda of our Party Central Committee.

In saving, we must grasp both major savings items and minor savings items, such as a sheet of paper, a tael of rice. Because, if one person saves a sheet of paper, and one person saves an ounce of rice, then across the country's six hundred million people, we will save six hundred million sheets of paper, and six hundred million ounces of rice. Ten thousand "sesame seeds" can roll into a "watermelon." When the quantity is large, it is no longer "sesame seeds."

However, when holding "watermelons" and grasping "sesame seeds," we must also distinguish between the important and urgent, the priority and secondary. Recently, I visited a people's commune. The agricultural production of this commune is very good, and the diversified operations, commerce, finance, and credit work are also done relatively well. There are many experiences, but the main one is: the commune party committee and its members all know that: production must be grasped well, but only grasping production without grasping other work will not better promote the development of production. Therefore, they grasp both production and other things. But not all at once, but with priorities and urgency, with primary and secondary, according to different periods, different situations, and different requirements, grasping rhythmically. All kinds of work are lined up and grasped, not only are they not mutually affected, but they are mutually promoted.

I lived in this commune for more than ten days, and did not see the phenomenon of losing sight of one thing while attending to another, or grasping the east and losing the west, nor did I hear complaints about not valuing the work of business departments. What I heard and saw was: up and down, left and right, in unison, united and harmonious, everyone was vigorous and energetic, doing all kinds of work in a down-to-earth manner, and doing it all very well.

Ideological methods and working methods are consistent. To have correct working methods, one must first have correct ideological methods. In work, to hold onto "watermelons" without discarding "sesame seeds," one must have a correct understanding of the respective roles and interrelationships of "watermelons" and "sesame seeds," and then put them in their respective positions and grasp them rhythmically, so that they can move forward in an orderly manner. This is a kind of leadership art.

    西瓜、芝麻及其他
    承里
    西瓜和芝麻比较，大小分明。于是有人用这来比喻工作的主次，把工作中的重要问题、方面、部分叫做“西瓜”。次要的问题、琐碎的工作，就叫做“芝麻”。
    “西瓜”，自然非首先抱住不可；但“芝麻”，却也不能丢掉。
    菜、油、酱、醋、胡椒、针、线、剪刀、碗、杓、筷、扫帚、拖把……等等之类，同钢、粮、棉、煤、机械等比较起来，自然是“芝麻”。可是，我们的党中央却向来很重视。最近，还在上海市召开会议讨论安排副食品和手工业生产问题。为什么？道理很简单。人民需要这些“芝麻”。所以，它就摆到我们党中央的议事日程上来了。
    在节约中，要抓大项节约，也抓小项节约，诸如一张纸，一两米之类。因为，一人节约一张纸，一人节约一两米，全国六亿人民，就会节约六亿张纸，六千万斤米。万粒“芝麻”，滚成个“西瓜”。数量一多，就不再是“芝麻”了。
    但是，在抱“西瓜”和抓“芝麻”的时候，也要分个轻重缓急，先后主次。最近，到过一个人民公社。这个公社的农业生产搞的很好，多种经营、商业、财政、信用工作，搞的也比较出色。经验很多，但主要的是：公社党委及其成员，都知道：生产必须抓好，但只抓生产，不抓其它工作，就不能更好的促进生产发展。因此，他们既抓生产，又抓其它。但不是一把抓，而是有轻重缓急，有先后主次，根据不同时期，不同情况，不同要求，有节奏的抓。各样工作都排上队，抓起来了，不但没有互相影响，而且是互相促进。
    我在这个公社住十多天，没有看到顾此失彼，抓东丢西的现象，没有听到不重视业务部门工作的怨言。听到和看到的是：上下左右，步调一致，团结和谐，个个生龙活虎，踏踏实实在做着各项工作，而且做的都很出色。
    思想方法和工作方法是一致的。要有正确的工作方法，必须先有正确的思想方法。在工作中要抱住“西瓜”，又不丢掉“芝麻”。就必须对“西瓜”、“芝麻”的各自作用、互相关系，有个正确的认识，然后才能把它摆到各自的位置上，有节奏地去抓，使之有条不紊地前进，这是一种领导艺术。
