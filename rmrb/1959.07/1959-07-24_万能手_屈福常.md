　　The All-rounder—Qu Fuchang
　　Qu Fuchang is the warehouse manager of the Xipu Village of the Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province. Because he is skilled in several types of craftsmanship, he has saved the commune a lot of expenses, and the commune members affectionately call him "All-rounder."
　　"All-rounder" is earned by Qu Fuchang's thought of loving the commune as his home and his spirit of hard work and study. In his work as a warehouse keeper, he couldn't bear the commune spending money to hire carpenters, so he decided to learn carpentry himself. Finally, he learned from repairing houses to making livestock troughs, ladders, and many other carpentry jobs. The "coachman" broke the livestock rope and asked for a new one. He said, "Reducing expenses will increase income. Re-joining the broken rope is just as useful." Later, he learned how to make ropes, splice rope, and weave sacks. In this way, he learned whatever he needed, acquiring a wide variety of skills.
　　Based only on a rough estimate of the 21 simple bungalows, iron work, and grinding work that Qu Fuchang has handled over the past few years, the commune has saved nearly 300 yuan in wages for hiring craftsmen. The commune had 40 sacks that were so tattered they couldn't be used as early as 1954. He patched them with cloth and hemp thread, extending their use for another two years; when they became even more tattered, he pieced them together using a method of combining three into two, extending their use for another two years. This item alone saved the commune more than 270 yuan in sack purchasing expenses.
　　Running a commune with diligence and thrift requires versatility, with one person doing the work of many. Qu Fuchang is such a banner. As the number of sheep and pigs collectively raised by the commune continues to grow, Qu Fuchang, regardless of the busyness of his warehouse management work, also automatically takes on the work of a breeder. He also learned general techniques for treating pig diseases and delivering lambs. In the four years since 1954, he has been responsible for raising more than 80 lambs; from 1957 to now, he has raised 39 piglets into large pigs, accumulating 380 cartloads of manure.
　　Loving the commune as his home is the ideological driving force for Qu Fuchang's development into an "all-rounder." He is an old hired farmhand who has worked as a long-term laborer for more than 20 years. In the autumn of 1953, he joined the Jianming Cooperative at the time, and everyone elected him as the warehouse keeper. For more than five years, he has been conscientious, diligent, and cared for public property even more than his own family business. 　Our reporter

    万能手——屈福常
    屈福常是河北遵化县建明人民公社西铺村的仓库管理员。由于他会好几种工匠活，给社里节省了许多费用，社员们亲切地管他叫“万能手”。
    “万能手”是屈福常爱社如家的思想和刻苦钻研学习精神换来的。在管库工作中，他舍不得社里花钱去请木匠，就决心自己学木匠活。终于从学会修房子，到会作牲口槽、梯子等许多木工活。“车把式”把牲口绳套使断了，要求换新的。他说：“少开支才能增加收入，把断绳套重新接好一样能顶用。”以后他就学会了打绳子、接绳套，以及补织麻袋等。就这样，需要什么就学什么，先后学会了多种多样的本领。
    仅据由屈福常几年来经手修的二十一间简单平房、作的铁活和打磨三项初略估算，节省了请工匠的工资近三百元。社里有四十条麻袋，在1954年就破烂得不能用了。他用布片、麻线等补织好，多用了两年；以后更加破烂了，他就用三条合两条的办法加以拼凑，又多用了两年。只此一项，就又为社里节省买麻袋的开支二百七十多元。
    勤俭办社需要多才多艺，一人干活顶多人。屈福常就是这样的一面旗帜。随着社里集体饲养的羊、猪不断增长，屈福常不顾自己管库工作的繁忙，还自动担负一个饲养员的工作。他还学会了医治猪病和接羊羔的一般技术。从1954年起的四年内，他先后负责饲养了八十多只羊羔；从1957年到现在，他已把三十九口小猪喂成了大猪，积圈肥三百八十车。
    爱社如家是屈福常发展为“万能手”的思想动力。他是一位扛过二十多年长工的老雇农，1953年秋天加入了当时的建明合作社，大伙选他当了管库员。在五年多的时间内，始终兢兢业业、勤勤恳恳，保管公共财产比对他自己的家业还更关心。　本报记者
