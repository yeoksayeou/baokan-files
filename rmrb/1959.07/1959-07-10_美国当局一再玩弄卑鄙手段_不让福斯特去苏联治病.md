Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 9th: The U.S. Federal Court on the 8th brazenly refused to drop the unreasonable charges against William Z. Foster, honorary chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, and refused to relax his travel restrictions, thereby depriving Foster of his right to seek medical treatment in the Soviet Union. Since 1949, the U.S. authorities have brought charges against Foster four times under the Smith Act. Because Foster suffered from a serious illness, the trial could not proceed, but the U.S. authorities used the despicable means of keeping the charges effective to "place Foster under house arrest."

Foster is now seventy-eight years old. A paralytic stroke has kept him bedridden for almost twenty months. Foster believes that treatment in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries can help him regain his ability to work and prolong his life, and the people of socialist countries warmly welcome Foster to their countries for medical treatment and recuperation. However, the unreasonable charges against Foster by the U.S. authorities keep him on bail. He is only allowed to move in southern New York and cannot obtain a passport to go abroad.

    美国当局一再玩弄卑鄙手段
    不让福斯特去苏联治病
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：美国联邦法院8日悍然拒绝撤销对美国共产党名誉主席福斯特的无理起诉，并且拒绝放宽他的旅行限制，从而剥夺了福斯特去苏联治病的权利。自1949年以来，美国当局根据史密斯反共法案曾经四次对福斯特提出起诉。由于福斯特患有重病，审讯没有能够进行，但是美国当局利用起诉继续有效这一卑鄙手段，一直对福斯特进行“软禁”。
    福斯特现在已经七十八岁了。瘫痪性中风使他二十个月来几乎离不开病床。福斯特相信，到苏联和其他社会主义国家治疗可以帮助他恢复工作能力和延长他的寿命，而社会主义国家的人民也热情地欢迎福斯特到他们的国家来医疗和休养。但是，美国当局对福斯特无理的起诉使他继续处于保释状态。他只被允许在纽约南部行动，得不到出国护照。
