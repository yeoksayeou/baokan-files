My second daughter-in-law, Zhengui, was recently transferred to work as a nursery worker in a kindergarten. Whenever this is brought up, I feel awkward. Dealing with kids who don't even know when to pee or poop all day long, what kind of future is that! Who knew my second son would actually support her: "Do a good job, don't be impatient, you'll take care of the kids well." That girl Zhengui doesn't know what's good for her and even replies with a cheeky grin, "Don't worry, I guarantee I'll do a great job!"
Children are a piece of flesh from your own body, who doesn't feel the pain? If they aren't cared for properly, the mothers will sneer and glare. Why is that girl Zhengui willing to do this kind of job! And my second son, now that he's the production team leader, why can't he take care of her!
That day, coming back from work, I saw Zhengui looking gray and sitting there blankly. I asked her, "What's wrong?" My second son also asked, "Are you having difficulties?" Zhengui held it back for a long time, then a big tear fell down. It turned out that: Aunt Qian Ying's A'tun is four years old this year, spoiled rotten, and the most troublesome, always causing trouble or hitting someone; he also knows how to throw a tantrum and cry endlessly. That day, A'tun stubbornly grabbed two cloth dolls and wouldn't let anyone else touch them, and even hit other children. Zhengui said a few words to him, and he started crying. Who knew that Qian Ying happened to be passing by at this time, and when she saw this scene, oh no, she dropped her carrying pole, and regardless of right or wrong, she hugged A'tun and started wailing, "Oh, your life is so bitter, they're all ganging up on you... Let's go!" Saying this, she picked up the child and went home. Zhengui was truly like a mute eating bitter herbs, with no place to complain, and became so anxious that she cried. How about that? I said this job isn't easy, but she insisted on showing off her abilities. My second son asked Zhengui, "Are you willing to continue working there?" At this time, I really wanted to answer for her: "Forget it, we're not cut out for this, quickly transfer her to the production team!" Hey! Guess what? This girl Zhengui is really strange, she not only didn't shake her head, but instead said confidently, "Keep going!" After speaking, she stood up straight and went to explain to Qian Ying.
These days Zhengui has lost weight. She used to have a bright red round face, but now it looks like someone took a knife to it. I feel really sad seeing her, isn't she ruining her own health!
One night, the two of them were chatting in the yard, and I heard everything clearly. My second son asked, "How's the kindergarten these days?" Zhengui said, "I've figured out the tricks, it's much better than before." My second son asked again, "Are the kids still being difficult?" Zhengui replied, "They are difficult, but they also listen very well. Why don’t you go take a look tomorrow, they are really adorable!" My second son joked, "Come on, you almost got married off in a sedan chair that day - you were crying." I only heard Zhengui giggle and say, "Why are you bringing up old news?"
The next day, I took a stroll around the kindergarten, and wow! My second daughter-in-law was right, that's exactly how it is. As soon as I walked into the gate, I saw more than a dozen chubby kids lined up neatly, all wearing white bibs with red flowers embroidered on them; each little round face, like an apple, was so pretty! Zhengui was like a king among children, clapping her hands and teaching everyone to sing "Sit in a row, eat fruit." Her voice was high-pitched and so lovely! I was afraid of being seen by them, so I slipped out. On the way, I ran into Defa's wife, who grabbed my hand and said, "Your Zhengui is really great. My child is lucky to have her taking care of him all day long, eating well, sleeping well, his clothes are clean, and he's getting fatter too…" I interrupted, "Your child is getting fatter, but my daughter-in-law is getting thinner." She said, "Zhengui this girl is overworking herself too… Sigh, Auntie, I was a little worried at first, but now I entrust him to her like I'm entrusting him to my own family, my child is so lucky!" Hearing this, I felt happy in my heart; people are praising my daughter-in-law, how could I not be happy!
Ever since Qian Ying took her child home that day, she hadn't brought him back to the kindergarten, Zhengui explained to her clearly, and persuaded her several times, but she was still unwilling. One night, it was raining heavily outside, Zhengui had already gone to bed, when suddenly she heard that Qian Ying's A'tun had a high fever, she didn't care about anything, threw back the covers, put on her clothes, and left, I shouted after her, but she had already gone far. This was terrible! It was suddenly cold and warm, she was bound to get sick. I quickly put on my raincoat and went to catch up. I chased her to Qian Ying's house, went inside and asked, and they said Zhengui wasn't there. I hurried back, and just happened to run into Zhengui at Qian Ying's doorway. Oh my! Look at what she looks like now! Her eyebrows, hair, and clothes were all soaking wet, barefoot, looking like a drowned chicken. Behind her was a doctor, and they had run here, probably slipped and fell several times on the way, covered in mud. I grabbed her and said, "Are you crazy!" She didn't care about any of this, and busily led the doctor to the child. Qian Ying stared blankly at them, her face streaming with tears, and after a long while she said, "Zhengui, you're too good!" That night, they didn't sleep until the middle of the night. Needless to say, in a few days A'tun's illness got better, Qian Ying brought him to the kindergarten and taught him to say, "Thank you, good Auntie!" From then on, Zhengui's reputation as a "good Auntie" spread.
After that, no matter when, people praised me when they saw me: "Your daughter-in-law is good!" Saying this, they also gave me a thumbs up. I, the mother-in-law, have benefited from my daughter-in-law's light, speaking of which it's really... how should I put it?

    婆婆的心事
    周鸿铸
    俺二媳妇贞桂，新近调到幼儿园里去当保育员。一提起这件事，我就觉得别扭，天天和那些不知屙屎撒尿的孩子打交道，有啥出息！谁知俺家老二反倒给她撑腰：“好好干吧，不要性急，孩子会带好的。”贞桂那丫头也不知好歹，还嘻皮笑脸地回答：“你放心好了，保证干得呱呱叫！”
    孩子是自己身上的一块肉，谁不疼的慌，一点没服侍到，妈妈们就要嗤鼻瞪眼。贞桂这丫头为啥愿意干这份差使！俺老二也是，自己当了生产队长，咋就不能照顾照顾她哩！
    那天收工回来，看见贞桂一脸灰气，呆呆地坐在那儿。我就问她：“咋的？”老二也问：“有困难吗？”贞桂憋了半天，一颗大泪珠掉了下来。原来是：钱英家的阿囤今年四岁了，娇生惯养，最会闹事，不是惹了这个，就是打了那个；他还会打千斤坠耍赖皮，哭个不停。这天阿囤硬霸住两个布娃娃不让别人摸，还动手打别的孩子。贞桂说了他几句，他就哭起来了。哪知这时候恰好钱英走这儿过，一看这情景，不得了喽，撂下扁担，不管青红皂白，搂过阿囤就哭天喊地：“哎呀，你的命苦哟，人家合伙欺负你……，咱们走！”说着抱起孩子就回家了。贞桂这时真是哑子吃黄连，有苦无处诉，就急得哭了起来。怎么样？我说这差使不是好当的，她偏要逞能。老二问贞桂：“愿不愿意再干下去了？”这时我真想替她回答：“拉倒吧，咱不是吃这碗饭的人，快把她调到生产队里去！”嗨！你说怎么着？贞桂这丫头真怪，她不但没有摇头，反而理直气壮地说：“干下去！”说罢，一挺腿站起来，找钱英解释去了。
    这些日子贞桂瘦了。原来是一个红亮亮的圆脸蛋，不知咋的像被谁削了两刀似的。我看了好生难过，她这不是糟蹋自己的身子吗！
    有天晚上，他们两口子在院里拉呱，一五一十我都听清了，老二问：“这几天幼儿园怎么样？”贞桂说：“摸出了门道，比从前好得多了。”老二又问：“孩子还闹人不？”贞桂回答道：“闹是闹，可是也很听话。你明儿个去看看吧，才逗人爱呢！”老二打趣道：“得了吧，那天你差点坐花轿——哭了。”只听贞桂咯咯笑道：“你还翻什么陈账。”
    第二天我到幼儿园里转了一遭，嗬！可真叫俺二媳妇说对了，就是那么回事。一走进大门口，只见十几个胖娃子齐整整地排在一起，都围着白兜肚，还绣上红花；一个个小圆脸蛋，像苹果一样，可美哩！贞桂是个孩子王，她一边拍着手，一边教大家唱“排排坐，吃果果。”那声音尖尖的，可好听啦！我生怕被他们看见，就溜了出来。走在路上碰见得发媳妇，她拉着我的手说：“你家的贞桂，可真是好样的。俺那孩子亏她一天到晚地服侍，吃得好，睡得好，衣裳干干净净的，人也长胖了。……”我接上去说：“胖了你家孩子，俺那媳妇可累瘦了。”她说：“贞桂这闺女也操劳过度了。……唉，大婶，起先我还有点不放心呢，现在交给她就像交给自己亲人一样，俺这孩子可享福啦！”我听了，心里乐滋滋的；人家夸俺媳妇，你想我能不高兴吗！
    钱英自打那天把孩子抱回家以后，就一直没有抱回幼儿园去，贞桂向她解释清楚了，又劝了好几次，她还是不愿意。有一天夜里，外面下着大雨，贞桂已经上床睡了，忽然听说钱英的阿囤发高烧，她也不管三七二十一，掀开被窝披起衣裳就走，我连叫带喊，她早走远了。这还得了！乍寒乍暖，非激出病来不可。我急忙披上蓑衣就去追赶。我撵到钱英家，进去一问，说贞桂不在。我连忙往回走，刚好在钱英家门口碰到贞桂。哎呀！你看看她现在像啥样子吧！眉毛、头发、衣裳都是水淋淋的，赤着脚，活像个落汤鸡。她后面跟着个医生，两人跑着来的，路上八成滑倒了几次，满身都是泥水。我拉住她说：“你不要命啦！”她却不管这些，忙引医生到孩子身边去。钱英呆呆地看着他们，脸上淌满了眼泪，半天才说：“贞桂，你太好了！”那晚直闹到大半夜才睡觉。不消说，过几天阿囤的病便好了，钱英将他抱到幼儿园里，教他说：“谢谢好阿姨！”从此，贞桂这“好阿姨”的名声就传开了。
    以后，不管什么时候，人们见了我就啧啧称赞：“你家的媳妇不错呀！”说着还向我翘翘大拇指。咱这做婆婆的反倒沾了媳妇的光，说起来真是……该怎么说呢？
