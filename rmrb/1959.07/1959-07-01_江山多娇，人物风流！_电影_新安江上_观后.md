Beautiful Rivers and Mountains, Elegant People!
—After Seeing the Movie "On the Xin'an River"

　　Formally speaking, this can be considered a "selection of scenes" in film. Three short films, the characters and plots are not complicated, but each explains quite extraordinary things, which indeed has the characteristics of a "selection of scenes." However, it goes far beyond that. Because of the picturesque scenery that also contains a strong vitality in that "prelude"; because it never leaves that vast and every-second-counts battle scene; especially because of the optimistic, cheerful, and upward tone that runs through the three films in a non-rigid way; thus the beautiful rivers and mountains and the heroic people complement each other, forming a magnificent picture whose scope is not limited to the Xin'an River. The screenwriter Comrade Zhang Junxiang humbly stated that he was exploring a new style. In my opinion, his creation is successful, because he expressed a vibrant construction scene on the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, and even more so, he expressed how much joy and encouragement this scene brings to people! To put it simply, it is written with emotion and filmed with life! It is a painting and a poem!

　　It can be clearly seen how deeply the entire crew was attracted by the magnificent scenery of the Xin'an River! This is understandable. Anyone who has been to such a construction site will have the same feeling. What is rare is that the film does not excessively indulge in showing those large-scale scenes (although this is always the easiest to attract people), but instead selects three sets of wonderful fragments from such a vast, galloping battle, from which one can associate with the overall situation. Mainly in the three plays, the protagonists reflect from all sides the essential things that constitute this magnificent scene—the gradually growing communist new style.

　　For example: the friendship without jealousy, willing to teach and learn, between Qin Yu San and Min Guan Zhong, these two competitors ("Qin Huzi and Men Hulu" [Qin the Tiger Cub and Silent Gourd]); Li Lianxiang's broad mind that does not care about personal gains and losses, and puts the interests of the whole first ("Old Master Li"); especially Tong Mingjiang, who widely promotes the wisdom of the masses and uses it as the foundation for daring to think and daring to do, as well as the prominent faces of some young people around him ("Dongfeng Restaurant") etc., are all indispensable cornerstones for creating this miraculous project. To expand on this, it is precisely the guiding ideology and emotion since the Great Leap Forward. The reason why the film is not limited to showing a corner of the Xin'an River lies in this.

　　The film was mostly shot on site, and some were even shot among the masses. Facing such a true face of life, it is a test that is not easy for actors to withstand, because if the actor is not breathing in the same rhythm as the life being portrayed, the actor's paleness and artificiality will immediately be revealed. Now it seems harmonious, which is very gratifying, indicating that the crew did not live next to the construction site as mere bystanders. If we were to make further requests on this happy basis, it would be, whether it is permissible to do some more detailed (of course, absolutely do not abandon the overall style because of this) processing? For example, use a little more delicate brushstrokes to depict the deep minds of the characters; under the bright sunshine, seek the beauty of composition, and let the heroic achievements have more poetic style; at some appropriate times, free up a small amount of ink to depict the beautiful scenery of the Xin'an River, so that the beauty of the mountains and rivers is also intertwined in the heroic picture? I think it is still possible, that would make such documentary art films have a more vivid and beautiful appearance. But, in any case, "On the Xin'an River" has taken a successful step. Without its success, the examples mentioned above could not have been drawn.

    江山多娇，人物风流！
    ——电影“新安江上”观后

    单从形式上看，这算得是电影中的“折子戏”。三部短片，人物、情节都不复杂，但，一花一世界，都各自说明着颇不平凡的事物，确是有“折子戏”的特色。然而，又远不止于此，由于有了景物如画、而又内蕴着很强烈的生命力的那个“前奏”；由于一直没离开那一片气势辽阔、分秒必争的战斗场景；特别是由于有了在三部片子中都颇不呆板地贯串着的乐观、开朗、向上的基调；因而使得美丽的河山与英雄的人民，交相辉映，构成了一幅其范围并不限于新安江上的瑰丽图景。编剧张骏祥同志谦虚地表示自己是在探索一种新的样式，我看，他这个创作是成功的，因为他表现了在祖国的锦绣河山上一片蓬勃发展的建设景象，更表现出了这一片景象带给人们的是多么巨大的欢乐，多么巨大的鼓舞！说的简单些，写得有感情，拍得有生命！是画，也是诗！
    可以很清楚地看出，整个摄制组的人员，被新安江上的壮丽景色吸引得多么厉害！这很可理解，凡是到过这类建设现场的人，都会有同样的感受。难得的是，影片没有过分热衷地去表现那些规模宏大的场面（虽然这总是最容易吸引住人的），而是从这样一大场万马奔腾般的战斗中，选出了这样三组可以由之联想起全局的精彩片断。主要地在于三组戏里的主人翁，是从各个侧面反映出了构成这一片宏伟景象本质事物——逐渐成长壮大的共产主义新风格。
    比如：存在于秦雨三和闵管中这一对竞争者之间的没有忌妒、肯教肯学的友谊（“秦虎子和闷葫芦”）；李莲香那种不计个人得失，把眼光放在全体利益上的宽阔胸怀（“老李师傅”）；特别是广泛地发扬了群众智慧，并以之做为敢想敢干基础的童明江，以及他周围一些年轻人的峥嵘面貌（“东风楼”）等等，都是造成这个奇迹般的工程所不可缺的基石，扩大些说，也正是大跃进以来的主导思想感情，之所以说影片并不局限于表现了新安江上的一隅，理由也就在此。
    影片大都是在现场，有的甚至就是在群众之中拍的，面对着这样一片本色面目的生活真实，对演员说来是个不易经受得起的考验，因为如果不是和所表现的生活同脉搏、共呼吸，演员的苍白和造作立即就会现形。现在看来是谐和的，这很可喜，说明摄制组没有在工地旁观地生活。如果在这个令人高兴的基础上再提些进一步的要求的话，那就是，是否还允许再做些更细致（当然绝对不要因而抛弃了总的格调）的加工呢？比方说再用点精细的笔触去描绘一下人物的深刻心灵；在一片明朗的阳光之下，寻求一下构图的美，让英雄的业迹，更多地具备一些诗的格调；在一些适当的时机，腾出一小点笔墨，去描绘一下新安江的美丽景色，让山川的秀色也交织在英雄的图卷之中？我看还是可以的，那将会使得这类纪录性艺术片获有更生动、更美丽的面貌。但，无论如何，“新安江上”还是跨出了成功的一步，前边这些比方，如果没有它的成功，也还是引不出来的。
