Flue-cured Tobacco Topping and Suckering Experience for Increased Production
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Tobacco Research Institute

Cultivating sucker tobacco is an effective way to increase the number of flue-cured tobacco leaves. Production practices in 1958 proved that leaving suckers on tobacco plants can increase production by 30-40%. After flue-curing and testing the sucker leaves, the aroma and combustibility were found to be good. Now, we present the sucker retention experiences from various regions as follows:

(1) Planting spring tobacco to extend the growing period of sucker leaves: Sucker tobacco is cultivated by leaving suckers only after the leaves on the main stem are basically mature. Leaving suckers on late-season tobacco often results in short growing periods for the suckers, preventing them from fully developing, leading to a green color after curing and low yield and quality. Therefore, to improve the second crop of tobacco, measures such as hotbed or heated-bed seedling cultivation, spring planting in fields, and strengthened management should be adopted to ensure that the sucker leaves have sufficient time to grow, thereby achieving a bumper harvest.

(2) The position and number of suckers retained should be appropriate: According to the experience in Henan Province, spring tobacco should primarily focus on cultivating bottom suckers. In a small number of tobacco fields with heavy fertilization, top suckers can be retained at discretion to prevent coarse tobacco leaves. When retaining bottom suckers, it is necessary to wait until the middle leaves of the tobacco plant are harvested, and then select a strong bud from the middle of the two rows below the middle leaves (approximately at the sixth to seventh leaf axil from the top), leaving about fifteen leaves. After the top leaves are harvested, cut off the main stem from above the bottom sucker to concentrate nutrients on the sucker leaves. The leaves grown on the sucker will then be in the position of the middle leaves, and their quality will not differ much from that of the formal middle leaves, which will not only increase production but also expand the range of the middle leaves. After selecting bottom suckers, the people of Zunyi County in Guizhou Province slightly tilt the main stem towards the northwest to allow the sucker leaves to receive more sunlight and ventilation, so as to promote their development and early maturity.

The growing period of wheat-stubble tobacco is relatively short, so only top suckers should be retained for general varieties. According to the experience of the masses in Linqu, Shandong, after topping, the first batch of axillary buds should be removed. When the second batch of buds emerges, one or two strong buds should be selected at the third to fourth leaf axil below the top leaves, leaving five to six leaves on each sucker. As for bottom suckers, their growing period is late, and the leaves are not easy to grow large and mature; dividing fertilizer between middle suckers will affect the quality of the top and middle leaves, so they should not be retained.

The position of retained suckers must also be determined according to the planting method. If it is planted in large and small ridges, the tobacco suckers should be uniformly selected and left on the side close to the large ridge to receive more sunlight and advance the maturity of the sucker leaves.

The most important thing to avoid when retaining suckers is retaining too many. Suckers growing on suckers, layer upon layer, the so-called "five generations under one roof" "ten sons and hundreds of grandchildren," not only makes the sucker leaves thin and small, with a green color after curing, but also leads to insufficient nutrients for the leaves on the main stem, causing severe bottom curing and reduced production.

The retention of suckers must be flexibly controlled according to conditions such as early or late transplanting, soil fertility, and the number of leaves of the variety. Tobacco fields that are planted late and have poor soil fertility should not retain suckers. Multi-leaf varieties (such as Shandong Multi-leaf, Yunnan Multi-leaf, etc.) whose main stem already has seventy to one hundred or more leaves do not need to retain suckers.

(3) Pay attention to topdressing and management of sucker tobacco. After the middle leaves are harvested, topdress with fast-acting fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate and human urine in a timely manner. If cake fertilizer is used, it must be crushed and fermented before application, and watering should be combined with topdressing to promote fertilizer decomposition and rapid expansion of sucker leaves. In order to promote the early maturity and improve the quality of sucker leaves, foliar spraying of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer can be carried out two to three times, each time using three kilograms of superphosphate and two kilograms of potassium sulfate per mu, diluted with one hundred and fifty kilograms of water. If there is no potassium sulfate, it can be replaced by the leachate of twenty kilograms of grass ash. In addition, sucker tobacco should be topped in a timely manner, all remaining axillary buds should be removed to concentrate nutrients on the sucker leaves, and aphids and green caterpillars should be prevented and controlled in a timely manner to ensure the normal growth of the sucker leaves.

    烤烟留叉增产经验
    中国农业科学院烟草研究所
    培育叉烟是增加烤烟叶数的有效手段。1958年的生产实践证明，烟株留叉可增产30—40％。叉叶烤后经化验评级结果，香气、燃烧性都较好。现在把各地留叉经验介绍如下：
    （1）种植春烟延长叉叶的生育期：叉烟是在主茎叶片基本成熟后，才留叉培育。晚烟留叉往往因叉烟生长期太短，不能开片，烤色青，产量质量不高。因此要搞好二茬烟，就要采取温床或火炕育苗、春地栽烟、加强管理等措施，使叉叶有充分的生长时间，才能达到丰收的目的。
      （2）留叉部位、叶数要适当：河南省的经验，春烟以培育底叉为主。少数施肥量大的烟田，为了防止烟叶粗暴，可酌留顶叉。留底叉时间，须待烟腰叶收完，在腰叶以下二棚中间（约当自上而下第六至七个叶腋处）选留壮芽一个，留叶十五片左右。顶叶收完后，从底叉上方砍去主茎，使养分专注叉叶，叉上长出的叶片，恰当腰叶部位，品质与正式腰叶无甚出入，既增加了产量，还扩大了腰叶的范围。贵州遵义县群众选留底叉后，将主茎稍微向西北方面压斜，使叉叶多接受日光和通风，以促进开片，提早成熟。
    麦茬烟生长期比较短，一般品种只宜留顶叉。据山东临朐的群众经验，打顶后先抹第一遍腋芽，第二遍芽发生时，在顶叶下第三至四个叶腋处选留壮芽一至二个，每叉留叶五至六片。至于底叉生长期晚，叶片不易长大成熟；腰叉上下分肥，会影响顶叶和腰叶的质量，都不应留。
    留叉部位也须看栽植方式而定，如系大小垅，烟叉宜一律选留在靠大垅的一面，多接受阳光，提早叉叶成熟时期。
    留叉最忌过多，叉上留叉，密密层层，所谓“五世同堂”“十子百孙”，不仅叉叶瘦小，烤色青绿，反致主茎叶片养料不足，引起严重的底烘而减产。
    留叉须根据移栽早晚、地力肥瘦与品种叶数多少等条件，灵活掌握。凡种植晚、地力薄的烟田，不应留叉。多叶性品种（山东多叶，云南多叶等）其主茎叶数已达七十至一百余片，也不须再行留叉。
      （3）重视叉烟的追肥与管理。腰叶收完后，及时追施速效肥料硫酸铵、人尿等。如用饼肥，则须磨碎发酵后施用，并结合追肥进行浇水，促进肥料分解，叉叶迅速开片。为促使叉叶提早成熟，改进品质，可在根外喷施磷钾肥料二至三次，每次每亩用过磷酸钙三斤、硫酸钾二斤，兑水一百五十斤。如无硫酸钾，可以草灰二十斤的浸出液代替。此外，叉烟应及时打头，抹净其余腋芽，使养分专注叉叶，及时防治蚜虫和青虫，保证叉叶正常生长。
