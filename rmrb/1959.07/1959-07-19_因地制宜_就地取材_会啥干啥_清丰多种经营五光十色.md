Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 18th: Qingfeng County, Henan Province, is experiencing a vigorous and colorful development of diversified economy. The county now manages 137 different projects. The number of large livestock such as mules, horses, cattle, and donkeys has increased by 1,845 heads compared to the end of last year; the number of live pigs has increased by 17,576 heads, exceeding the state procurement target for the first half of the year by 18%; the famous Angora rabbits have grown to 456,000, an average of more than five per household; the renowned straw braids have already produced more than 3,200 bundles in the first half of this year, an increase of 60% over the same period last year; chickens and ducks have increased by 118% compared to the end of December 1958; sheep have increased by more than 50%; fish, bees, soda, saltpeter, ironwood industry, weaving, economic forests, etc., have also seen great development.

Qingfeng County has barren land and low yields of food crops. The vast majority of farmers have always regarded diversified economy as a major source of income. The County Party Committee attaches great importance to the development of diversified economy. It has also organized a diversified economy office. Communes, brigades, and production teams all have a secretary specifically in charge of this production.

In the development of diversified economy, the county, based on the principle of "working hard during the slack season, working less during the busy season, adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and doing what they know best," has established 4,275 various farms (factories) throughout the county, organized 2,386 specialized teams for diversified economy, and the labor force participating in diversified economy accounts for 13.4% of the county's total population. Under normal circumstances, personnel who raise livestock and poultry and other professional and technical personnel in various fields are not transferred or reassigned, greatly strengthening the technical guidance of various operations and facilitating the development of diversified economy.

In the development of diversified economic production, the County Party Committee pays special attention to solving various problems existing in the work. For example, the straw braids produced in Qingfeng County are famous at home and abroad for their thin skin, light grass, soft texture, bright and white color. In order to expand the production of this local specialty, the County Party Committee has planned to expand the planting area of ​​Triticum turgidum, ensuring the supply of raw materials. In order to solve the problem of livestock fodder, the County Party Committee fully mobilized the masses to store green grass and use raw materials such as cotton shells, corn cobs, peanut skins, sweet potato vines, and rice bran to make "five-fragrance" feed for livestock.

The signing of production and sales contracts between state commercial departments and communes, brigades, production teams, and individual commune members, and the correct implementation of the policy of paying higher prices for better quality, have greatly promoted the development of diversified economic production. Commercial departments have also adopted methods such as going from street to street, touring the countryside, and visiting homes to purchase, facilitating the masses to sell diversified economic products.

    因地制宜　就地取材　会啥干啥
    清丰多种经营五光十色
    据新华社郑州18日电　河南清丰县的多种经营蓬勃发展，五光十色。全县现在经营的项目，达到一百三十七种。骡、马、牛、驴大家畜，比去年底增加一千八百四十五头；生猪增加一万七千五百七十六头，超额18％完成上半年国家收购任务；著名的安哥拉兔已发展到四十五万六千只，平均每户五只多；享有盛名的草帽辫今年上半年已生产三千二百多包，比去年同期增加60％，鸡、鸭比1958年12月底增长118％；羊增加50％以上；鱼、蜂、土碱、火硝、铁木业、编织、经济林等也都有很大发展。
    清丰县土地瘠薄，粮食作物产量较低，广大农民向来就把多种经营作为一项主要的收入来源，县委根据这个特点，对发展多种经营十分重视，还组织了多种经济办公室；公社、大队和生产队也都有一个书记专管这项生产。
    这个县在发展多种经营中，根据农闲大干农忙小干，因地制宜，就地取材，会啥干啥的原则，在全县建立各种场（厂）四千二百七十五个，组织了两千三百八十六个多种经营专业队，参加多种经营的劳动力占全县总人口的13.4％。对饲养家畜家禽的人员和其他各方面的专业技术人员，在一般情况下不抽不调，大大地加强了各种经营的技术指导，便利了多种经营的发展。
    在发展多种经营生产中，县委特别注意解决工作中存在的各种问题。如清丰县出产的草帽辫，皮薄草轻、质地柔软、色泽光亮细白，在国内外享有盛名。为扩大这种土特产的生产，县委有计划地扩大了莛子麦的种植面积，保证了原料供应。为了解决牲口饲草和饲料问题，县委充分发动了群众贮存青草和利用棉花壳、玉米芯、花生皮、红薯秧、谷糠等原料制作五香料，给牲畜饲用。
    国家商业部门和公社、大队、生产队、社员个人订立产销合同，正确执行优质优价政策，对多种经营生产的发展有很大推动作用。商业部门还采取串街、游乡、登门收购的办法，便利群众出售多种经营产品。
