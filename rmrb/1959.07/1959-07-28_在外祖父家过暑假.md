Spending Summer Vacation at Grandfather's House
Li Ming

School's out for summer, and I'm spending my vacation at my grandfather's place. This is a large village by the Longhai Railway in northern Jiangsu. Here, I can eat my fill of big, sweet watermelons and jump into the streams and ponds by the village for a swim… I'm very happy to stay here; but more importantly, the family environment of my grandfather, a diligent and upward-striving farming life, makes one feel very happy.

My grandfather, Huang Shoushan, is sixty-seven years old, with a robust physique, ruddy complexion, and a loud, clear voice. He's an old hand at farming. In the days of individual farming, no one would sow his wheat if he didn't, and no one would pull up seedlings for his rice if he didn't start first. Because everyone trusted him, they all watched his actions for guidance; today, he is still respected by the younger generation, and the production team leader always likes to consult him about everything.

For the past few days, the people in the commune have been busy weeding the soybeans. My grandfather, aunt, second uncle, and second aunt, a family of four, contracted to weed a piece of riverbank field. Before starting, my grandfather presided over a field meeting. Without measuring beforehand, he confidently assigned the tasks:

"This field is a total of thirty mu and five fen, one hundred and thirty-eight ridges east to west… I think, uh," he glanced at my second uncle, "the two of us will each take eight mu, and you two sisters-in-law will each take five mu. The remainder…"

My aunt didn't say anything, just looked at my second aunt with an inquiring gaze. My second aunt shook her head, the butterfly knot on her braid fluttering a few times, and said:

"Why not divide it equally? My hoe is made of iron too!"

"Small-scale contracting, no delays, finish within three days!" said my second uncle.

"Of course, we'll finish on time!" My second aunt replied in a challenging tone: "I'm just afraid our dad won't be able to keep up!"

With a few words back and forth, the family launched into a competition: divide the task equally, see who finishes first; whoever finishes last buys two big watermelons to treat everyone.

The soybean seedlings are as tall as chopsticks, already forming clumps, a lovely green color, but the field is overgrown with weeds, several sprouting in one spot, including goosefoot, sow thistle, field bindweed, and knotgrass. In the low-lying areas, the weeds are even taller than the soybean seedlings!

"How did so many weeds grow?" I asked, puzzled.

"June weeds, even a club can't knock them down!" My grandfather stroked his beard and squinted his eyes, saying, "This year's wheat was too good, so good that you couldn't even stick a hoe in, so we had to scrimp on hoeing; after harvesting the wheat, we immediately sowed the soybeans. After the soybeans came out, there were several rains, and the soybeans grew well, but the weeds also grew fiercely…"

Before he finished speaking, five hoes started working at the same time. My hands were clumsy and my hoe awkward, and in the blink of an eye, I fell behind. My grandfather was wearing a blue cloth vest and an old straw hat, leaning over with his back arched, taking the lead. Sometimes, when the wind blew, you could see a few strands of his fluttering white beard from behind. Everyone else followed closely behind, not letting up with a single hoe. My second aunt worked with a bit more flair, her "changing stance" movements resembling a rural dance. Her name is Chang Yue'e, and she's a famous actress in the rural amateur theater troupe!

As the saying goes, "Hoeing fears three blades, an ox fears two plows." Just relying on these five hoes, they weeded an area larger than a threshing ground in no time. The soybean seedlings appeared more upright; the weeds were knocked down underfoot.

The fiery sun rose overhead, and the weather became hot and dry. "Hoeing millet under the midday sun, sweat drips onto the soil beneath," these two lines of poetry are a perfect depiction of the scene. My clothes were soaked with sweat, as if I had just crawled out of a pond. Just as the thought "Should we stop for the day?" popped into my head, I saw my grandfather suddenly stop his hoe: "Halt, the weather's too hot!"

"It's still early!"

"What's the rush!"

"The more scorching the sun, the more the weeds will die!" Yue'e auntie chuckled twice, "You've already lost the first round, old man."

"Halt, halt, if they don't go, we'll go!" My grandfather winked at me: "Let's go to the pond on the west side for a swim, then take a good nap in the willow grove…"

I wanted to go, but my feet didn't move. My grandfather simply picked up his hoe, poked me, and said, "You can't take it, child!" I followed him two steps, then turned back to look, and the other three were working hard!

When my grandfather went to the field in the afternoon, he was already seven or eight ridges behind. Although he forced himself to catch up two or three ridges before dark, he was still short. I thought to myself, "You're definitely going to lose!"

The next day, as soon as the rooster's crow floated in the mist, my grandfather got up. I asked sleepily, "Why are you getting up so early?"

"Going to hoe the field!"

"Isn't it too early?"

"Hey, you have to steal time to hoe in May and June, getting into the fields at this time isn't early at all!" He picked up his hoe and walked out. I jumped out of bed and hurriedly fumbled for my clothes. My grandfather said, "You rest, young people need enough sleep!" Later, when he saw that I insisted on going, he nodded in agreement.

The morning breeze gently caressed our faces, armpits, and the bends of our legs, giving a feeling of coolness and comfort. I felt as if strength was flowing into my arms, and the hoe seemed to weigh two pounds less. In a moment, I had hoed a "turnaround". My grandfather was even more energetic, wielding his hoe with a whooshing sound.

He doesn't smoke, so when he rested, he wandered around the field. I watched him from afar. He first went to the sections that my aunt and second uncle had hoed and inspected them, looking relatively satisfied, with a smile on his face; when he reached my second aunt's section, his expression suddenly changed.

"Hey, this isn't work done by a farmer!" He shouted in a straight voice: "Come and see, hey, bring the hoe over! The weeds around the base of the plants haven't been scraped away at all, and the ridges aren't clean either, this, this… it's outrageous!" As he spoke, he swung his hoe and started reworking the areas that had already been hoed. I also joined in.

Singing drifted over from behind the green curtain of sorghum:

The sun hasn't shown its face,
Night mist rests by the bean rack,
One hoe builds a golden stack,
Two hoes open a treasure pack.

Three figures gradually approached: my second aunt was walking in the front, like a magpie, flapping its wings and arriving in front of us in an instant: "Ha, you guys got a head start!" But, in just the blink of an eye, two red clouds rose on her cheeks. She realized that we were doing rework for her.

"Do you call this hoeing? You're combing the weeds!" My grandfather said. However, he quickly realized that she was a new bride who had not been married long, and he should restrain his temper, and his voice gradually lowered: "If people fool the land, the land will fool the people, how will the production team's increase production plan be completed?"

"I hoed too hastily…" Second aunt stammered.

"Like this," my grandfather demonstrated a movement, "Your eyes must be accurate, your hand must be steady, close to the seedlings, dig out the roots of the weeds!"

Three days passed, and a large piece of land was hoed on time.

As a result, my second uncle hoed the fastest, taking first place; everyone else, except for me, who hoed the slowest and came in last, my grandfather came in fourth. He silently bought two big, black-skinned watermelons and said, "We have an agreement, kids, come and eat watermelon!"

Uh, where did my second aunt go?

After waiting for a long time, we found that she had gone to the watermelon patch over there. She waved at me, asking me to help carry the watermelons. On the way, she said, "This time I lost, but next time you watch, I won't fall behind, and I won't be sloppy either."

In the end, they argued for a long time about who had lost. I didn't express any opinion, because I was busy biting into the plump, sweet watermelon!

### 在外祖父家过暑假

    在外祖父家过暑假
    黎明
    放暑假了，我到外祖父家里去度假期。这里是苏北陇海路旁的一个大村子，既能见天饱尝又大又甜的西瓜，又能随意跳到村旁溪塘里去洗澡……，我很乐意住在这儿；但更主要的，还是外祖父的家庭环境，一种辛勤向上的农家生活，使人过得十分愉快。
    外祖父叫黄寿山，六十七岁了，身板硬朗，面色红润，说话响儿叮当的，是个老庄稼把式。往日单干的时节，他的麦子不耩，没人动耩子；他的谷子不摘苗，没人去拉镢头。因为大伙儿信得过他，啥事都眼望着他的行动；今天，他还受着年青一辈的尊敬，不管啥活，生产队长总喜欢找他商量。
    几天来，公社里的人们都忙着锄豆子。外祖父、大妗子、二舅和二妗子，四口人包锄一块河滩田。插锄之前，外祖父主持开了一次田头会。他事先没有步量步量，就蛮有把握地指派开了：
      “这块田一共三十亩零五分，东西一百三十八垅……，我看呐，呃，”他瞅了二舅一眼：“俺爷俩个每人包八亩，您妯娌俩个每人五亩。下余……。”
    大妗子没有吱声，只是用询问的目光看了二妗子一眼。二妗子摇摇头，她辫梢上的蝴蝶结忽闪了几下，开腔了：
      “干嘛不平均分开呢？俺的锄头同样是铁打的！”“小包工，不拖空，三天以内要完成！”二舅说。“当然准时完成喽！”二妗子用一种挑战的口气回答道：“我正怕咱爹跟不上趟哩！”
    三说两说，一家人竟掀起一场竞赛：平均分任务，看谁早完成；最后锄完的，买两个大西瓜请客。
    豆苗儿长得有筷子般高，已经团棵了，绿莹莹的怪逗人爱，只是田间杂草丛生，一个眼里冒几棵，有萋萋芽，苦苦菜，芙苗秧和节节草。低洼的地方草比豆苗还高哩！
      “咋搞的这样多的草？”我不解地问。
      “六月草，棒打倒嘛！”外祖父捋着胡子眯缝着眼说：“今年麦子太好，好的插不进锄，结果不得不少耪一遍；割麦以后紧接着耩豆子。豆子出来接着几场雨，豆子长得不错，杂草也长得凶了……。”
    话没说完，五张锄一齐干开了。我手又笨，锄又拙，转眼间就落在后边了。外祖父穿一件蓝布背心，戴着顶半新不旧的斗笠，探着腰弓着背抢在最前面，有时风过，从后面可以看到几绺飘飘洒洒的花白胡须。其他人也都一锄不让地跟在后面，其中以二妗子干的花梢一点，在她“换架”的动作里露出一种跳农作舞的味道。她叫常月娥，是农村业余剧团的一个出名的演员哩！
    俗话说，“锄怕三张，牛怕二犋”，就凭这五张锄，一会儿就锄了比打谷场还大的一片。豆苗显得更挺拔了；杂草在脚下扑倒了。
  火热的太阳升到当头，天气燥热起来。“锄禾日当午，汗滴禾下土”，这两句诗是这时绝好的写照。我浑身衣裳都被汗水浸透，好像从水塘里钻出来的一样。“该收工了吧？”我心里才萌出这个念头，就见外祖父忽地歇住锄头：“收兵，天气太热了呵！”
    “天早哩！”
    “忙甚么！”
    “日头越毒越死草哟！”月娥妗子格格地笑了两声：“第一阵您老人家就败了。”
      “收兵，收兵，她们不走咱们走！”外祖父向我??嘴：“咱到西边塘里洗洗澡，然后到柳林里美美地睡它一觉……。”
    我心里想走，可是脚底板没有动弹，外祖父索性扛起锄头，捅了我一把，说：“你吃不消，孩子！”我跟着走了两步，再扭头回望时，那三个人干得正欢哩！
    下午外祖父下田时，已经落后七八垅田了。虽然在摸黑前他硬赶了两三垅田，仍然还差一截子地。我心想：“您老人家是输定了！”
    第二天，雄鸡的啼声刚在雾气里飘荡起来的时候，外祖父就爬起身来。我睡意朦胧地问道：“您干嘛起得这样早？”
      “锄地去呀！”
      “天太早吧？”
      “咳，五六月里偷锄地，这会儿下田不算早呀！”他摸起锄头就往外走。我骨碌跳下床来，慌着摸索衣裳。外祖父说：“你歇着吧，青年人睡不足不成！”后来他见我执意要去，也点头应允了。
    晨风轻轻地抚摸着我们的面颊、胳肢窝和腿弯儿，给人一种清凉、慰贴的感觉。我这时直觉得两膀生力，锄头减轻了二斤似的，一会儿便锄好了一个“来拐”。外祖父更是精神抖擞，一杆锄舞得风响。
    他不会吸烟，歇着的时候便到田里瞎转溜。我远远地看着他。他先走到大妗子、二舅锄过的地段查勘了一番，看神情比较满意，脸上挂着笑容；等他走到二妗子的地段里，神情陡然变了。
    “咳，这不是庄稼人做的活儿！”他直着嗓子喊道：“你来瞧吧，喂，捎过锄来！这里的围根草丝毫没有刮掉，垅子里也不干净呐，这，这……不像话！”说着，他抡起锄头就在锄过的地方加起工来。我也跟着动了手。
    隔着青纱帐飘来歌声：
    太阳没有露脸膛，
    夜雾歇在豆架旁，
    一锄筑成金垛垛，
    两锄打开百宝箱。
    三个人影渐渐近了：二妗子走在最前面，她像只花喜鹊儿，一扑闪翅膀就来到跟前：“哈，你们抢先了！”但是，只那么一眨眼的工夫，她的脸庞泛起两朵红霞。她看出俺爷俩正在替她做返工工作。
      “你这叫锄地吗？是替野草梳头哩！”外祖父说。不过，他很快意识到她是过门不久的新媳妇，对她应当捺住点性子，嗓门渐渐地变低了：“人混了地，地骗了人，生产队的增产计划指什么完成？”
      “我锄的太慌张……”二妗子结结巴巴地说。
      “这样儿，”外祖父做了一个示范动作，“眼要看准，手要把稳，挨着苗棵，挖净草根！”
    三天过去了，一大块田也准时锄好了。
    结果，二舅锄的最快，居第一名；其他人除我锄的最慢殿后外，外祖父就轮到第四名了。他一声不响地买来两个黑油皮大西瓜，说：“咱们有言在先，孩子们，快来吃西瓜吧！”
    呃，二妗子怎地不见了？
    等了好半天，才发现她走到瓜园那边去了。她向我招招手，叫我帮忙去搬西瓜，路上她说：“这次是我输了，下一次你瞧吧，俺既不会落后，更不会毛糙了。”
    到底是谁输了，他们一家还争论了半天。我在旁边没有发表任何意见，因为我嘴里正咬着肥硕蜜甜的西瓜哩！
