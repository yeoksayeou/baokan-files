Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 17th - According to TASS: The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference held a plenary session on the 16th, presided over by Lloyd.

    Herter spoke first, and he began by raising the question of the future procedures of the conference. He said that discussions should begin with a study of the proposals on the Berlin issue put forward by the three Western powers on June 16th. The US Secretary of State then trotted out the old arguments of the three Western delegations, re-defending the proposal, even though the proposal was aimed at making the West Berlin occupation regime permanent and therefore could not be supported by the Soviet Union.
    Lloyd spoke after Herter. He pointed out that it was necessary to seek ways to bring the views of all parties closer. He said that the explanations given by the Soviet delegation of Gromyko's statements on June 19th, June 28th, and July 13th had dispelled some misunderstandings of the Western delegations regarding the Soviet Union's recent proposals. He also compared the various provisions in the proposals of both sides, and summarized his views on the situation by saying: The positions of the two sides have not disappointed him regarding the possibility of reaching an agreement.
    Next, the head of the Soviet delegation, Gromyko, spoke. He pointed out that the time was ripe to begin more specific discussions, that is, to try to find some basis for the conference participants to reach agreement on the issues under discussion. He said that from this point of view, the speech of the British Foreign Secretary calling for efforts to seek possibilities for bringing the positions of all parties closer together should be welcomed. As for the Soviet government, all its proposals were aimed at enabling the conference participants to reach agreement on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and the issue of West Berlin.
    The head of the Soviet delegation pointed out that the Soviet government would not agree to the perpetuation of the occupation regime in West Berlin at any time and under any circumstances. The position of the Western countries is far from the position of the Soviet Union and many other countries (including the German Democratic Republic).
    Gromyko said that the Soviet Union put forward its latest proposal to further help reach an agreement. It is regrettable that this proposal has not yet received the due understanding from the Western governments. Gromyko pointed out again that at present, no one is treating the Soviet government's proposal with a completely negative attitude. The view that the Soviet proposal helps bring the positions of all parties closer and reach an agreement is gradually gaining ground, albeit slowly.
    Gromyko called on the conference participants to adopt a more realistic attitude and resolve the issue more quickly.
    Gromyko pointed out that as long as there is a desire to reach an agreement, the way the meeting is conducted - whether it is broader or narrower in scope - does not matter much.
    The heads of the French delegation, De Murville, the German Democratic Republic delegation, Bolz, and the German Federal Republic representative, Grewe, also spoke at the meeting.
    The date of the next meeting will be determined separately.

    葛罗米柯要求西方采取现实态度
    苏联不容西方永久占领西柏林
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：日内瓦外长会议16日举行全体会议，由劳埃德主持。
    赫脱第一个发言，他一开始就提出会议今后的程序问题。他说，应当从研究西方三国6月16日提出的关于柏林问题的建议开始进行讨论。这位美国国务卿接着又搬出了西方三国代表团的旧论据，为这个建议重新辩护了一番，尽管这个建议的目的是使西柏林占领制度永久化，因此不可能得到苏联的支持。
    劳埃德在赫脱之后发言。他指出，必须寻求使各方观点接近的途径。他说，苏联代表团对葛罗米柯在6月19日、6月28日和7月13日的声明所作的解释，消除了西方国家代表团对苏联最近的建议所产生的某些误解。他还把双方建议中的各项条款作了比较，并且总结他对形势的看法说：双方的立场并没有使他对达成协议的可能性感到失望。
    接着，苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯发言。他指出，开始更具体的讨论的时机已经成熟，也就是说，应该试图为会议参加者就所讨论的问题达成协议找到某些基础。他说，从这个观点出发，英国外交大臣呼吁努力为各方立场的接近寻求可能性的发言应当受到欢迎。至于苏联政府，它的一切建议都是为了使会议参加者就缔结对德和约问题和西柏林问题达成协议。
    苏联代表团团长指出，苏联政府在任何时候和任何情况下都不会同意西柏林占领制度的永久化。西方国家的立场同苏联和其他许多国家（其中包括德意志民主共和国）的立场存在着很大的距离。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联提出最近一个建议是为了更加有助于达成协议，令人遗憾的是，这个建议至今还没有得到西方国家政府应有的理解。葛罗米柯又指出，目前没有人以全盘否定的态度对待苏联政府的这个建议，认识到苏联这个建议有助于使各方立场接近和达成协议的看法正在逐渐抬头，尽管很慢。
    葛罗米柯呼吁会议参加者采取更为现实的态度，更迅速地解决问题。
    葛罗米柯指出，只要有达成协议的愿望，会议进行的方式——范围比较广泛的或是比较狭窄的——没有多大关系。
    法国代表团团长德姆维尔、德意志民主共和国代表团团长博尔茨和德意志联邦共和国代表格雷韦也在会上发了言。
    下次会议的日期将另行商定。
