Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The Ministry of Agriculture held a summer planting telephone conference on the evening of the 4th, requesting to accelerate the completion of the summer planting task, especially in areas where the summer planting progress is slow, it is necessary to quickly organize forces to rush to plant, and requires all places that can still be planted in summer to strive to plant more and harvest more.

Responsible persons from relevant departments in eighteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions with summer planting tasks participated in the meeting. According to the reports: In Anhui and Henan, where wheat harvesting was earlier and summer planting progressed faster, there were still a few places that had not finished planting by the beginning of July; Shandong and Hebei still have some areas that need to resist drought and rush to plant.

The meeting requested that all localities hurry up and plant, and not miss the farming season. Recently, most provinces in the Yellow River and Huai River basins have received rainfall one after another. These areas must seize the favorable opportunity after the rain to plant while the soil is still moist. A small number of areas that have not rained or have not received enough rain must concentrate their efforts to resist drought and rush to plant by every possible means, such as some areas have already mobilized personnel from government agencies, troops, schools, and urban residents to go to the countryside to provide support. Areas in the south where the planting area of double-cropping late rice has not been implemented should be quickly implemented, and the cultivation management of rice seedling fields should be strengthened so as to strive to plant more double-cropping late rice after the early rice harvest.

The meeting requested that areas that can continue summer planting should plant more oil crops, more late sweet potatoes, buckwheat, mung beans, and other late autumn grain crops and autumn vegetables.

The meeting finally requested that all localities strengthen the field management of large autumn crops while summer planting, and eliminate weeds. Some farmlands where summer planting cultivation is rough and insufficient base fertilizer is applied due to labor shortages must be remedied.

Urumqi, this newspaper, 6th: People's communes in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are currently seizing the summer sowing and replanting season, rushing to plant rice, late corn, late sorghum, millet, summer rapeseed, sesame, vegetables and other crops, striving to plant every inch of land, harvest every inch of grain, plant well and harvest more. According to incomplete statistics as of June 20, the entire autonomous region has sown more than 1.3 million mu of rice, more than 4.4 million mu of corn, more than 2 million mu of various oil crops, more than 300,000 mu of vegetables, and the total sown area of various crops has reached more than 29 million mu, an expansion of more than 2.8 million mu compared with last year.

Xinjiang has a vast territory and large differences in natural conditions in various places. People's communes in various places have adapted to local conditions while expanding the sown area, and fully utilized various favorable conditions. North of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, the land is vast and sparsely populated, and water and soil resources are relatively abundant, but due to the cold climate, most areas can only be sown once a year, and are also susceptible to disasters such as frost and freezing. People's communes in these areas vigorously reclaim wasteland and rush to plant ripe wasteland to increase total output. At present, the summer sowing work in these areas has basically ended. In the Altay Prefecture, located in the Altay Mountains, this year, as local herdsmen further moved towards settled nomadism, they organized farmers and herdsmen to reclaim many wastelands and plant grains and oil crops.

These areas have devised various methods in sowing in view of the local labor shortage. Many areas have organized communist collaborations between communes and communes, teams and teams, agricultural areas and pastoral areas, giving full play to the potential of labor, livestock, and tools.

People's communes in various parts of southern Tianshan, where the climate is relatively mild, in addition to vigorously reclaiming wasteland under possible conditions, also mobilized the masses to make full use of small pieces of wasteland near farmland, remove excessively wide field ridges, and use the open space in front of and behind houses to expand the sown area. At present, many people's communes are still using all vacant land to rush to plant late corn, millet, summer rapeseed and other crops. Chunhua People's Commune in Hotan County at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains has recently used field ridges, field edges, and open spaces in front of and behind houses to plant more than 8,200 mu of corn, oil crops, and vegetables in a very short period of time.

Another method for people's communes south of the Tianshan Mountains to expand the sown area is to use summer floods to expand the replanting area. At present, the preparations for replanting in various parts of southern Xinjiang have been fully launched, and some communes have selected the summer fields for replanting and started sending fertilizers to the edges of the fields. Kuqa County has irrigated 100,000 mu of wheat that is about to be harvested with running water, so that these lands have sufficient bottom moisture in advance, so as to sow while harvesting. Farmers in the Turpan Basin and at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains have successively sown seeds of late corn, sorghum, etc. in the fields where barley, highland barley, and wheat have been harvested.

This year, due to the universal strengthening of the leadership work of spring plowing and sowing in various places, the arrangement and organization of labor are good, and whether it is the amount of fertilizer applied, the depth and quality of plowing, the fine selection and treatment of seeds, etc., are better and more fertilizer is applied than last year.

    农业部要求十八省市区抓紧时机组织力量
    有雨无雨都要抢种
    新疆充分利用有利条件力争多种一分地多收一分粮
    新华社6日讯　农业部于4日晚召开夏种电话会议，要求加速完成夏种任务，特别是夏种进度较慢的地区要迅速组织力量突击抢种，并要求一切还可以夏种的地方尽可能力争做到多种多收。
    十八个有夏种任务的省、市、自治区有关部门负责人参加了这次会议。据汇报：麦收较早、夏种进度较快的安徽、河南到7月初，还有少数地方没有种完；山东、河北还有一部分地区需要抗旱抢种。
    会议要求各地赶快种上，不要误了农时。最近黄河、淮河流域各省大部都已先后下雨，这些地区要抓紧雨后有利时机，抢墒种上。还没有下雨和没有下透雨的少数地区也要集中力量，千方百计抗旱抢种，如部分地区已经动员机关、部队、学校人员和城镇居民下乡支援。南方双季晚稻插秧面积没有落实的要赶快落实，并要加强秧田的培育管理，以便在早稻收获后争取多种一些双季晚稻。
    会议要求还能继续进行夏种的地区，多种一些油料作物，多种一些晚甘薯、荞麦、绿豆等晚秋粮食作物和秋菜。
    会议最后要求各地在夏种中，同时加强大秋作物的田间管理，消灭草荒。有些因劳动力紧张以致夏种耕作粗糙和施底肥不足的农田，一定要设法补救。
    本报乌鲁木齐6日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各人民公社目前正在抓紧夏播和复播季节，抢种水稻、晚玉米、晚高粱、糜子、夏油菜、芝麻、蔬菜等各种农作物，力争多种一分地，多收一分粮，种好收多。据截至6月20日不完全统计，全自治区已播种水稻一百三十多万亩，玉米四百四十多万亩，各种油料二百多万亩，蔬菜三十多万亩，各种作物的总播种面积已达到二千九百多万亩，比去年扩大了二百八十多万亩。
    新疆地区辽阔，各地自然条件差异很大，各人民公社在扩大播种面积中都因时因地制宜，充分利用了各种有利条件。新疆天山以北，地广人稀，水土资源比较丰富，但因气候寒冷，大多地区一年只能播种一次，而且还容易受到霜、冻等灾害，这些地区的人民公社就大力开荒和抢墒多种熟荒地，增加总产。目前这些地区的夏播工作基本结束。位于阿尔泰山的阿勒泰专区，今年在当地牧民进一步走向定居游牧的情况下，组织农牧民开垦了许多荒地，并播种上粮食和油料等。
    这些地区在播种中都根据当地劳动力缺乏的情况，想了种种办法。许多地区组织了社与社、队与队、农业区和牧业区的共产主义大协作，充分发挥了劳畜力和工具的潜力。
    气候比较温和的天山南部各地人民公社，除在可能条件下大力开荒外，并发动群众充分利用农田附近的小片荒地、铲除过宽的地埂、利用宅前宅后的空地扩大播种面积。目前许多人民公社还正在利用一切空闲地抢播晚玉米、糜子、夏油菜等作物。昆仑山下和阗县的春花人民公社，最近在很短时间内，已利用田埂、地边、宅前宅后的空地种植玉米、油料、蔬菜等八千二百多亩。
    天山以南各人民公社另一个扩大播种面积的办法是：利用夏季洪水，扩大复播面积。目前南疆各地的复播准备工作已全面展开，部分公社已选好了复播的夏田，开始往地边送肥。库车县已给十万亩即将收割的小麦浇了跑马水，使这些土地事先都有充足的底墒，以便一面收割一面播种。吐鲁番盆地和昆仑山下的农民，现在已陆续在收割了大麦、青稞和小麦的田间，播下了晚玉米、高粱等种籽。
    今年由于各地普遍加强了春耕播种的领导工作，劳动力安排和组织得好，无论施肥量、犁地的深度和质量、种籽的精选和处理等，都比去年作得好、肥上得多。
