Moscow dispatch from our newspaper, July 13th: The editors of the new edition of "History of the CPSU," I. Mintz (Academician), A. Kuchkin (Doctor of Historical Sciences), and V. Zaitsev (Associate Doctor of Historical Sciences), when answering questions from a reporter from "Literary Gazette" regarding the compilation of the new edition of "History of the CPSU," explained the necessity of compiling the new edition, the differences between the new edition of "History of the CPSU" and the previously published "History of the CPSU" textbook, and pointed out the enormous political significance of publishing the new edition.

They first pointed out that studying the past and present history of the CPSU movement is one of the most important ways to arm the Soviet people with Marxism-Leninism. The previously published histories of the CPSU and related teaching materials on party history cannot be considered complete explanations of the party's history. Especially in the last twenty years, the party's struggles have never been clarified. Therefore, it is very clear that real life demands the compilation of a newer, more complete, and more correct edition of party history.

In explaining the differences between the new edition of party history and previous party history books, they pointed out that the new edition of party history first and foremost truthfully reflects Lenin's outstanding role in establishing the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and establishing the world's first socialist state. Based on many other works by Lenin, the compilation of the new edition of party history made it possible to correct a series of serious errors in the earlier published party history textbooks. For example, regarding the evaluation of the 1912 Prague Party Conference, it was previously thought that the independent activities of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union began after this conference. But at that time, everyone knew that Lenin had pointed out more than once that the Bolsheviks, as a political ideological school and party, had begun in 1903, and Lenin's party program and charter were adopted at the Second Congress.

These editors further pointed out that another important element in affirming Lenin's role in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the international revolutionary movement is to correctly treat Lenin's works. Therefore, the new edition of party history has increased the analysis and introduction of Lenin's works several times more than the "Short Course." It is absolutely impossible to limit oneself to introducing Lenin's early works to explain the history of the CPSU as before. For example, Lenin's theory of party building is not only elaborated in the book "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back," but also clarified in almost all the works before 1903 and many works after the report of the Second Congress. This theoretical elaboration at each new stage enabled Lenin to develop his theory. They then pointed out that all Leninist issues—the theory of party building, the dictatorship of the proletariat, the worker-peasant alliance, the theory of socialist and communist construction, the national question, and so on—have been fully elaborated in the new edition of party history. The new edition of party history also includes special chapters on Lenin as the framer of concrete socialist construction plans, and Lenin's theoretical issues on industrialization, collectivization, and cultural revolution.

These editors pointed out that Lenin's role after the October Revolution was diminished in the earlier party history textbooks.

They then pointed out that the new edition of party history introduces the history of the CPSU in the last twenty years. This period of history is divided into five chapters: the pre-war consolidation and development of socialist society; the party's role in organizing the defeat of fascism during the war years; the post-war recovery and development period; the Five-Year Plan of 1953-1958. It comprehensively introduces the great upsurge of the Soviet economy and culture during this period and the further unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The last chapter of the new edition of party history is the Twenty-First Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This congress not only has great practical significance for formulating the tasks of building communism in the Soviet Union, but also developed Marxist-Leninist theoretical issues.

The new edition of party history compiled a large number of works and documents, and the entire book took two years to compile.

    新版“苏共党史”编者答“文学报”记者问
    新版党史具有重大政治意义
    对列宁主义问题作了全面阐述
    本报莫斯科13日电　新版“苏共党史”编著者伊·明兹（院士）、阿·库契金（历史学博士）、弗·查伊采夫（历史学副博士），就编著新版“苏共党史”问题回答“文学报”记者时，说明了编著新版“苏共党史”的必要性，新版“苏共党史”与以前出版的“苏共党史”教课书的区别，指明了出版新版“苏共党史”的巨大政治意义。
    他们首先指出：学习过去的和现在的苏共运动史，这是用马克思列宁主义武装苏联人民的最重要的途径之一。以前出版的苏共党史和有关党史的教学书籍，不能被认为是完整地阐述了党的历史。尤其是最近二十年来，党的斗争从未有过阐明。因此非常明显，现实的生活提出了必须编著更完整、更正确的新版党史。
    在说明新版党史与先前党史书籍不同之处时，他们指出：新版党史首先是真实地反映出了列宁在建立苏联共产党和建立世界第一个社会主义国家中的杰出作用。根据列宁的许多其他著作，使新版党史编著中有可能修正了早先出版的党史教科书中一系列的严重错误。例如对1912年布拉格党代表会议的估价问题，早先认为，苏联共产党独立活动就是从这次代表会后开始的。但当时谁都知道，列宁已经不止一次地指出，布尔什维克作为政治思想学派和政党，是从1903年就开始了的，在二次代表大会上就通过了列宁的党纲与党章。
    这些编者们又指出，肯定列宁对苏联共产党和国际革命运动作用的另一重要要素，是正确地对待列宁的著作。所以，新版党史比“简明教程”数倍地增加了对列宁著作的分析介绍。决不能像先前仅仅限于介绍列宁早期作品来阐述苏共党史。如关于列宁的建党学说，不只是“进一步退两步”一书中阐述了，而是1903年前差不多所有的著作以及二次代表大会报告之后的许多著作都有所阐明，这种每一次新阶段上的理论阐明，使列宁发展了自己的学说。他们接着指出：全部列宁主义问题——建党理论、无产阶级专政、工农联盟、社会主义和共产主义建设等理论、民族问题等等，在新版党史中有了全面阐述。新版党史中还增有列宁是社会主义具体建设计划制订者、列宁关于工业化、集体化、文化革命等理论问题的专门章节。
    这些编著者们指出：在早先的党史教科书对列宁在十月革命之后的作用贬低了。
    他们接着指出，新版党史对最近二十年苏共党史作了介绍。这段历史时间共分五个章节：战前巩固和发展社会主义社会；战争年代，党在组织粉碎法西斯中的作用；战后恢复和发展时期；1953年—1958年的五年计划。全面介绍了这一期间苏联经济和文化的巨大高涨和苏联共产党的进一步团结统一。新版党史最后一章为苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会。这次代表大会不仅对制订苏联建设共产主义任务具有巨大现实意义，而且发展了马克思列宁主义理论问题。
    新版党史编著时汇集了大量的著作与文件，全书编著共用了两年时间。
