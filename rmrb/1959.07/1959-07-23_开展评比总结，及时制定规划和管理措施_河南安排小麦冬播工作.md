Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 22nd: Henan Province is arranging this year's winter wheat planting work from all aspects.

Since the autumn wheat planting last year, all regions of Henan Province have conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and this year's wheat has generally achieved a bumper harvest. Therefore, the primary task for arranging winter wheat sowing this year is to conscientiously summarize the valuable experience of the summer wheat bumper harvest to guide next year's wheat production. Since the beginning of the wheat harvest, all regions of the province have launched a province-wide appraisal and summarization campaign from top to bottom. The Provincial Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with teachers and students from Beijing Agricultural University, organized seven inspection teams in early June to go to areas with various natural conditions such as plains, mountains, sandy loam areas, saline-alkali depressions, and hills, according to the Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture, to summarize a relatively complete set of experiences as the main basis for formulating measures to increase wheat production next year. Through appraisal, Yiyang County has initially summarized five key points for increasing production: deep plowing, close planting, seeds, watering, and fertilization. In order to conscientiously summarize the experience of this year's large-area high-yield fields, Kaifeng Prefecture strictly implemented single harvesting and threshing, special management, and special summarization for large-area high-yield fields with a yield of more than 300 jin per mu throughout the region, and wrote out the high-yield experience for each field.

While summarizing the experience of high wheat yields, many regions have also formulated plans and management measures for winter-sown wheat in a timely manner. According to this year's high-yield experience, Weishi County in Kaifeng Prefecture plans to deep plow all winter-sown wheat fields to about one foot this year, use improved varieties, achieve five waterings and five fertilizations, and generally implement rational close planting. According to the fact that large-area high-yield fields have generally achieved bumper harvests this year, all localities have unanimously affirmed the leadership method of using high-yield fields to drive the production of general fields. The province has initially planned that large-area high-yield fields for autumn-sown wheat this year should account for 25% to 30% of the wheat sowing area.

The province has prepared more than 1.7 billion jin of wheat seeds needed for autumn sowing. Most of these seeds are high-quality varieties such as Nanda 2419, Bima No. 1, Zhongnong 28, and Bima No. 4, which have achieved high yields in this year's large-area bumper harvests. Now all localities are seizing the time to turn over and dry the land and select seeds. More than 4 million mu of wheat fields are also being deep plowed. In order to ensure sufficient base fertilizer for this year's wheat, the province is carrying out a large-scale summer manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign.

    开展评比总结，及时制定规划和管理措施
    河南安排小麦冬播工作
    新华社郑州22日电　河南省正在从各方面安排今年小麦冬播工作。
    河南省各个地区从去年秋季种麦开始，认真贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”，今年小麦普遍获得丰收。因此，今年各地安排冬麦播种的首要任务，就是认真地总结夏季小麦丰收的宝贵经验，指导好明年小麦生产。全省各个地区从麦收开始，就自上而下的展开了全民性的评比总结。省农业厅配合北京农业大学下放的师生，在6月初组织了七个检查组，分赴平原、山区、沙壤区、盐碱洼地、丘陵等各种不同自然条件的地区，按照农业八字宪法，总结出一套比较完整的经验，作为制订明年小麦增产措施的主要依据。伊阳县通过评比，初步总结出深翻、密植、种籽、浇水、施肥五大增产关键。开封专区为了认真总结今年大面积丰产方丰收的经验，全区对亩产三百斤以上的大面积丰产方，都严格做到单收单打，专人管理，专人总结，方方都写出丰产经验。
    很多地区在总结小麦丰产经验的同时，都及时制订了冬播小麦的规划和管理措施。开封专区?县根据今年丰产的经验，计划今年冬种麦田全部深翻一尺左右，采用优良品种，做到五水五肥，并且普遍进行合理密植。各地还根据今年大面积丰产方普遍丰收的事实，一致肯定运用丰产方带动一般田生产的领导方法。全省初步规划，今年秋播小麦大面积的丰产方，要占麦播面积25％到30％。
    全省各地秋播需要的小麦种籽已准备好十七亿多斤，这些种籽大部分都是今年大面积丰收中获得高额产量的南大二四一九、碧蚂一号、中农二八、碧蚂四号等优良品种，现在各地都在抓紧时间，翻晒土地和挑选种籽。全省四百多万亩正茬麦田也在深翻。为保证今年小麦有充足的底肥，全省正在开展一个规模浩大的夏季积肥造肥运动。
