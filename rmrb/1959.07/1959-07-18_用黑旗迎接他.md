    Greet Him with Black Flags
    Xiang Qing
    The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council calls on the African people to boycott the "French Community Administrative Committee" meeting held in Madagascar, and calls on all African people to greet French President De Gaulle, who is presiding over this meeting, with black flags everywhere. This will unambiguously show the true feelings of the African people towards this harmful act of French imperialism. Wherever he goes, he brings disaster; wherever he goes, he brings death. He is a jinx, and anyone who sees him will have bad luck and never have good fortune in their lives! Now he sways and comes to Madagascar again, bringing the "French Community Plan." Although he has a smile on his face, everyone knows that it is full of conspiracies and sinister schemes! He wants to strangle the African people's struggle for freedom and wants to firmly establish the throne of the French Empire in Africa. Humph! Who would fall for your trick! Since the jinx has come, we cannot let him leave in vain. The African people should express their true feelings towards French imperialism. We must make him hurt deeply and pierce his soul. We will raise thousands of black flags, like thousands of thunderclaps, hitting his head on the road he passes. A black wave is rolling, and the world is spinning. Let him hear the people's curses, let him see no hope, let him only see darkness! A sea of death!

    用黑旗迎接他
    向青
    亚非人民团结理事会号召非洲人民，抵制在马达加斯加举行的“法兰西共同体行政委员会”的会议，并号召所有非洲人民在各个地方用黑旗来迎接主持这个会议的法国总统戴高乐。以便毫不含糊地表明非洲人民对法国帝国主义者的这个有害行为的真实感情。他走到这里，便给这里带来灾殃，他走到那里，便给那里带来死亡，他是个丧门神，谁见了都够晦气，一生得不到吉祥！现在他摇摇摆摆，又来到马达加斯加，带来“法兰西共同体计划”，虽然满脸笑嘻嘻，众人都知道，那里面都是阴谋毒计！想绞死非洲人民争取自由的斗争，想使法兰西帝国的王座在非洲扎得牢牢稳稳。哼！谁会上你的套圈！丧门神既然来了，也不能白白给他走掉，非洲人民对法帝国主义应该表示一下真实的感情。我们要让他痛得深，戳穿他的灵魂。我们举起千万面黑旗，像千万个响雷，在他经过的路上，顶着他的脑门。一片黑的浪涛滚滚，天地也在旋转。让他听听人民诅咒的声音，让他见不到希望，让他只见到眼前一片黑暗！一片死亡！
