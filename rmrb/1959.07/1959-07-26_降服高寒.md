    Conquering the High and Cold
    Qinghai, located in the high and cold mountainous region at the source of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, needs to strengthen scientific research on conquering the high and cold in order to develop agricultural production. In the past few years, the departments in Qinghai Province directly in charge of agricultural production have been carrying out this work, and it is necessary to continue to strengthen it in the future. Many state-owned farms have also carried out some scientific research activities to varying degrees and have achieved some good results. In the future, when arranging production measures, it is necessary for all state-owned farms and people's communes to incorporate scientific research activities into their plans.
    It is worth mentioning that scientific research departments and some higher agricultural colleges have gained a certain understanding of Qinghai's natural conditions in the past few years through methods such as investigation, visits, and sending personnel to work at lower levels. Some scientific workers have also included research topics such as the utilization of alpine ice and snow in their research plans. However, the people of Qinghai urgently hope that scientific research departments and scientific workers can gain a greater understanding of the natural environment in high and cold regions and provide more scientific research assistance. If scientific research on conquering the high and cold achieves success, it will not only be of great significance to the development of agricultural production in Qinghai, but will also open up avenues for developing production in other high and cold regions.

    降服高寒
    长江黄河之源的青海，地处高寒山区，要发展农业生产，就要加强关于征服高寒的科学研究工作。几年来，青海省直接领导农业生产的部门已经进行了这项工作，今后自必要继续加强。许多国营农场也已经程度不同地进行了一些科学研究活动，有了一些好的效果。在今后安排生产措施的时候，各个国营农场、人民公社都有必要把科学研究活动安排进去。
    值得提出的是，科学研究部门和有的高等农业院校，几年来采取了考察、参观、下放锻炼等办法，对青海的自然条件已经作了一定的了解。有的科学工作者还在研究计划里安排了高山冰雪利用等的研究课题。但是，青海人民还迫切地希望着科学研究部门、科学工作者们对高寒地区的自然环境能作更多的了解，给予更多的科学研究上的帮助。如果降服高寒的科学研究有所成就，则不仅对发展青海的农业生产有重大意义，而且也将为其它高寒地区开辟发展生产的道路。
