Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 9th: The Cameroonian People's Union announced here today in a communique that Cameroonian freedom fighters, in recent attacks on French military camps, killed over 100 French soldiers, wounded over 70, and captured many weapons and ammunition.

The communique stated that the reactionary actions of the French colonial authorities in Cameroon are intensifying everywhere. They have adopted measures such as issuing martial law, establishing special courts, declaring states of emergency, and many other unreasonable measures. Two days ago, a curfew from sunset to sunrise was implemented throughout Cameroon. However, nationalists and the Cameroonian people are retaliating, striking the enemy everywhere.

The Cameroonian People's Union reiterated its demand for new elections before independence.

The communique concluded that the People's Union is adopting policies suitable for the new situation, in order to wage the struggle more resolutely than ever before, until the complete liberation of Cameroon.

    新华社开罗9日电　喀麦隆人民联盟今天在这里发表公报说，喀麦隆自由战士在最近对法国军营的袭击中击毙了一百多名法国兵，打伤了七十多名，并且缴获了许多武器和弹药。
    公报说，喀麦隆的法国殖民当局在各地的反动行为是变本加厉了。他们采取了发布戒严法令、建立特别法庭，宣布紧急状态和其他许多不讲理的措施。两天前，在喀麦隆各地实施了从日落到日出的戒严。但是，民族主义者和喀麦隆人民予以回击，随处打击敌人。
    喀麦隆人民联盟重申在独立前举行新的选举的要求。
    公报最后说，人民联盟正在采取适合于新情况的政策，以便比以往更加坚决地进行斗争，直到喀麦隆全部解放为止。
