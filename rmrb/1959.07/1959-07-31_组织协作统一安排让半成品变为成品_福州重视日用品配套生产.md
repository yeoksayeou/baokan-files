Organizing Coordination and Unified Arrangements to Turn Semi-Finished Products into Finished Products:
Fuzhou Emphasizes Supporting Production of Daily Necessities

(Our newspaper's Fuzhou dispatch, July 30th) Fuzhou City, in organizing the production of daily necessities, particularly emphasizes the supporting production of daily necessities, ensuring that a large number of stockpiled semi-finished products are continuously released from factories. To date, a total of 25,000 semi-finished umbrellas have been fitted with umbrella handles, and more than 30,000 thermos bottle liners have been fitted with bamboo shells and put on the market for supply. Other items such as toothpaste tubes, kerosene lamps, and boxes have also been equipped with necessary parts and are continuously being released to the market.

Many daily necessities require the cooperation and collaboration of several production units to be manufactured. In the previous period, there was a shortcoming in Fuzhou's small commodity production of neglecting supporting components. For example, in April and May, the market demand for umbrellas exceeded supply, but the umbrella factory had 50,000 umbrellas that could not be released from the factory due to a lack of iron nails and aluminum tops. The glass factory produced a total of 620,000 thermos bottle liners in the first half of the year, of which more than 190,000 were stockpiled and could not be put on the market because they lacked bamboo shells for assembly. In response to the above situation, Fuzhou City, in organizing the production of daily necessities, has paid attention to solving the problem of supporting components for daily necessities, promoting the rapid release of a large number of semi-finished products from the factory, meeting market needs, and laying a favorable foundation for the normal production of daily necessities in the future.

Their measures are: First, under the leadership of the Municipal Production Committee and the Planning Committee, product plans are unified and comprehensively balanced according to the needs of production and supply. Small products that were not included in the plan in the past but need to be supported are also included in the planned management, and production is assigned to various factories to ensure the timely, high-quality, and sufficient completion of production plans.

Secondly, for small products that are included in the plan and balanced, the supply of raw materials and materials is uniformly arranged according to production needs. In July, Fuzhou City has allocated more than 200 tons of steel and non-ferrous metals to various production units to specially manufacture supporting products and other small commodities; for some special materials, such as iron nails, iron wires, and umbrella handle aluminum for umbrellas, the commercial department is responsible for supplying them.

Third, strengthen industrial and commercial cooperation and organize new supporting relationships. For example, kerosene lamp heads were previously purchased directly from Shantou and other places by the factory, but this was later suspended. Now, the Fuzhou Department Store Wholesale Station is actively organizing supplies from other provinces to solve the production problem of kerosene lamps.

Fourth, reasonably solve the price problem of supporting products and raw materials. For example, the price of thermos bottle bamboo shells was too high, which affected costs. After detailed accounting by relevant departments, the price of bamboo shells was reduced from 44 cents to 35 cents, and the price of raw bamboo was also reduced from 1.62 yuan per root to 1.27 yuan.

Fifth, relevant departments organize working groups to regularly go deep into various factories to check the implementation of plans such as supporting production, promptly discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner. (Zhang Haozhong)

    组织协作统一安排让半成品变为成品
    福州重视日用品配套生产
    本报福州30日电　福州市在组织日用品生产中特别重视日用品配套生产，保证了大批积压的半成品源源出厂。到目前止，共计已有二万五千把半成的雨伞配上伞头，三万多个热水瓶胆配上竹壳上市供应。其他如牙膏管、煤油灯、箱子等也都配上了必要的零件源源上市。
    许多日用品需要几个生产单位配合、协作才能制成。前一个时期，福州市小商品生产中存在着忽视配套的缺点。例如4、5月间市场上雨伞供不应求，雨伞厂却有五万把雨伞缺少铁钉、铝顶等而不能出厂。玻璃厂上半年一共生产了六十二万个热水瓶胆，其中就有十九万多个因为没有竹壳装配而积压着不能应市。针对上述情况，福州市在组织日用品生产中，注意解决日用品的配套问题，促使大量的半成品迅速出厂，供应市场需要，并为今后日用品正常生产打下有利基础。
    他们的措施是：首先，在市生产委员会和计划委员会的领导下，根据生产、供应的需要，统一安排产品计划，进行综合平衡，并将过去未列入计划的、需要配套的小产品也列入了计划管理，分配各厂生产，保证按时、按质、按量完成生产计划。
    其次列入计划、平衡的小产品，根据生产需要，统一安排原料和材料的供应。7月份，福州市已拨出二百多吨钢材和有色金属，分别供应各生产单位专门制造配套产品和其他小商品；对有些专用的材料如雨伞的铁钉、铁线、伞头用铝等，则由商业部门负责供应。
    第三，加强工商协作，组织新的配套关系。如煤油灯灯头，过去由工厂直接向汕头等地购进，但是后来停顿了。现在福州百货批发站积极从省外组织供应，解决煤油灯的生产问题。
    第四，合理解决配套产品和原料的价格问题。如热水瓶竹壳由于价格太高，影响成本，经有关部门详细核算后，把竹壳的价格由四角四分降为三角五分，同时把毛竹原料也由每根一元六角二分降为一元二角七分。
    第五，由有关部门组织工作组，经常深入各工厂检查配套生产等计划的执行情况，及时发现问题及时解决。（张好忠）
