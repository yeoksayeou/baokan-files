Cultivating Children's Morality, Improving Teaching Quality
Nanjing Changping Road Elementary School Arranges Production Labor According to Children's Characteristics

(Our report) Nanjing Changping Road Elementary School, in the process of teaching, according to the characteristics of children and the specific circumstances of the school, scientifically and meticulously arranges production labor, so that production labor not only helps to enhance children's physical fitness, but also directly cultivates children's communist moral qualities and improves teaching quality.

Changping Road Elementary School has a total of twenty-five classes and more than 1,200 students (including three kindergarten classes). Their arrangement of student labor is that grades one and two do not have labor courses. Labor classes for other grades are twice a week, one hour each time for middle grades, and 1.5 hours each time for higher grades. Each student also takes turns doing 15 minutes of sanitation work each week. In total, each person works no more than four hours per week.

The teachers at Changping Road Elementary School recognize that the purpose of production labor is mainly to increase children's knowledge and cultivate children's labor habits. Therefore, they pay great attention not to make children engage in labor that they cannot handle.

The production labor projects they arrange are all able to increase children's knowledge and interest them. Each class is assigned a small plot of land. On sunny days, students engage in planting trees, planting flowers, pruning, weeding, removing insects, digging soil, watering, and other labor to tidy up the garden; on cloudy days, they work indoors, such as pasting matchboxes, pasting paper bags, cutting plastic, tying fan flowers, sewing glove openings... and so on. In order to cultivate children's interest in science, the school also bought some rabbits and geese for the students to raise in their spare time. For classes with feeding tasks, feeding material collection, feeding, sanitation, and medical care groups are established according to children's interests and needs. The school also draws students from higher grades who love crop experiments to form a scientific research group. The scientific research group planted experimental crops such as "Soybean King," "Castor Bean King," and "Peanut King" on several plots of land the size of office desks.

Because the teachers at Changping Road Elementary School can conduct ideological education for students in conjunction with labor, the students understand how to cherish their own labor results and love public property, and the students' communist morality has shown a significant increase. The school's equipment is not good, but under the diligent cleaning and careful maintenance of the students, people will feel a fresh feeling as soon as they enter the school: the windows are bright and clean, and the trees are shady. The students cherish the flowers and trees they have cultivated themselves, and no one picks a flower or a fruit. They say: "Loving the school's plants and trees is loving the motherland!"

Under the influence of their older brothers and sisters, the children in kindergarten never damage a flower. They use teacups to scoop water to water the flowers and play games around the flowers. The flowers remain on the branches until they wither.

After carefully studying the Party's teaching policy this semester, the teachers at Changping Road Elementary School have clarified that school labor should not only cultivate children's communist morality, but also serve teaching. Therefore, when organizing students to work, pay attention to explaining relevant knowledge to students. For example, when planting ginkgo flowers, explain to the students the uses of "white fruit," its economic value, the significance of planting ginkgo to the country, the characteristics of ginkgo, and so on. Now, there are more than 100 kinds of flowers and trees planted in the school. Many students can distinguish between trees and shrubs, evergreen trees and deciduous trees, economic trees and general trees, woody flowers and herbaceous flowers... They also have some understanding of the varieties of flowers and trees, planting time, and management methods. Senior students have also enriched their arithmetic knowledge by calculating labor such as flower and tree row spacing and plant spacing. Because the labor time is not long, the amount of labor is not heavy, and the class time and labor time are staggered, the students are full of energy and concentrate when listening to the class. This semester, the students' academic performance has improved compared with the previous semester, and the test scores of the vast majority of classes have increased. For example, the average language score of Class 4-4 this semester increased from 68 points in the previous semester to 80 points, and arithmetic increased from 72 points to 83.5 points.

The teachers at Changping Road Elementary School are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made. They are further studying the Party's teaching policy and summarizing experience in order to arrange production labor in a way that better meets the requirements of teaching and is more conducive to improving teaching quality.

In order to cultivate children's interest in science, the school also bought some geese, rabbits, etc., for the students to raise in their spare time.

    培养儿童品德　提高教学质量
    南京长平路小学按照儿童特点安排生产劳动
    本报讯　南京长平路小学在教学过程中，根据儿童的特点和学校的具体情况，科学细致地安排生产劳动，使生产劳动既有助于增强儿童体质，又直接培养了儿童的共产主义道德品质，提高了教学质量。
    长平路小学共有二十五个班，一千二百多学生（其中有三个幼儿园班）。他们对学生劳动的安排，一、二年级不排劳动课程。其它班的劳动课每周两次，中年级每次一小时；高年级每次一点五小时。每个学生每周还轮流从事十五分钟的卫生劳动。总起来，每人每周劳动不超过四小时。
    长平路小学的教师们认识到生产劳动的目的主要是增长儿童知识和培养儿童的劳动习惯。因此，他们非常注意不使儿童从事力不胜任的劳动。
  　他们安排的生产劳动项目，都是能增长儿童知识、使儿童感兴趣的。每个班都分有一小块园地。晴天，学生们就从事植树、种花、修枝、拔草、除虫、扒土、浇水等整理园地的劳动；阴天就在室内劳动。如糊火柴盒、糊纸口袋、剪塑料、扎扇子花、缝手套口……等等。为了培养儿童对科学的兴趣，学校还买了一些兔子、鹅，让学生们在业余时间喂养。有饲养任务的班级，按儿童兴趣和需要成立饲料采集、喂养、卫生、医疗等小组。学校还从高年级各班抽调爱好农作物试验的学生成立科学研究小组。科学研究小组在几块像办公桌大小的园地内种植了“黄豆大王”、“蓖麻大王”、“花生大王”等试验作物。
    长平路小学由于教师们能配合劳动对学生进行思想教育，因而学生们很懂得爱护自己的劳动成果和热爱公共财物，学生的共产主义品德有了显著的增长。这个学校的设备并不好，但在学生们辛勤打扫和精心维护下，人们一走进学校就会产生一种清新的感觉：窗明几净，绿树成荫。学生们对于自己亲手培植的花木非常爱护，没有人去摘一朵花或一个果子。他们说：“爱护学校的一草一木就是爱祖国！”
    幼儿园的孩子在哥哥姐姐们的影响下，也从不损坏一朵花。他们用茶杯舀水浇花，围着花儿做游戏。花儿直到枯萎，仍然留在花枝上。
    长平路小学的教师们本学期认真地学习了党的教学方针以后，明确了学校劳动不仅要培养儿童共产主义道德品质，而且是为教学服务的。因此，在组织学生劳动时，注意对学生讲解有关知识。例如，种植银杏花时，就对学生说明“白果”的用途，经济价值，种银杏对国家的意义，银杏的特性等等知识。现在，学校里种有一百多种花木。许多学生对于乔木与灌木、常绿树与落叶树、经济树木与一般树木、木本花与草本花……都能区别；对于花木的品种、种植时间和管理方法也都有些了解。高年级学生还通过计算花木行距、棵距等劳动，丰富了算术知识。由于劳动时间不长，劳动份量不重，上课与劳动时间互相交错，因此学生听课时精神饱满、注意力集中。这学期学生学习成绩比上学期有所提高，绝大多数班级的考试分数都上升了。例如四四班这学期的语文平均分数由上学期的68分上升到80分，算术由72分上升到83.5分。
    长平路小学的教师对于已经获得的成绩并不满足。他们正在进一步学习党的教学方针，总结经验，以便把生产劳动安排得更能符合教学要求，更能有助于教学质量的提高。　　　　　　　（鲍春光）（附图片）
