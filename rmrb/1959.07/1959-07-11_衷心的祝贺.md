Having listened to the performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony by the Central Philharmonic Orchestra and the Central Broadcasting Orchestra Choir at the Sunday Concert, I am immensely excited. I recall that about twenty years ago, an Italian conductor named Bar器 also conducted this work in Shanghai, but that was performed by an orchestra affiliated with the Shanghai Municipal Council, a colonial institution, and only a few Chinese musicians participated in this performance, which was hailed as a "grand event in the arts." However, today, the young Chinese conductor Yan Liangkun and an equally young orchestra and choir (the average age of the entire ensemble is no more than twenty-five) have also performed this magnificent classic. We certainly cannot say that this performance is perfect in every way, but the fact that the capital's musicians, with their spirited and high-spirited attitude, and after more than a month of meticulous rehearsal, have been able to achieve such results today must be attributed to the conductor Yan Liangkun's diligent work ethic, and we must congratulate all the artists for their touching achievements.

As soon as the solemn and powerful call of the theme in the first movement was played by the low-pitched string instruments, it immediately attracted the audience, and the second half of the motive in the main section immediately answered this call, bravely responding to the preparation for battle... The entire performance was so focused and simple, and the joyful second movement and the composed third movement were played in one go. The fourth movement successfully expressed that sublime emotion from the beginning, and the conductor handled the so-called Beethovenian "stutter" (referring to the sudden pause in the music) very naturally, endowing the upcoming singing of the baritone with an almost sacred atmosphere. The performance of the baritone singer Wei Qixian must be mentioned; he successfully sang this most demanding solo part.

The conductor did not pursue the external effects of the music; every movement of his embodied one of the most essential qualities of conducting this symphony – passion within restraint.

I hope that the musicians who participated in this performance can further refine it. We know that in works like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, there are still many essences of musical intention in each chapter that need to be carefully examined and find the perfect way to express them. For example, the high degree of "coherence" in the quartet – unity in contrast – can only achieve the ultimate in performance through many careful rehearsals. But we firmly believe that we can reach this realm.

Heartfelt congratulations on the success of the performance!

[Editor's Note: The Central People's Broadcasting Station will broadcast the live performance of this symphony tomorrow (12th) morning from 10:15 to 12:00, using the wavelength of the first program.]

    衷心的祝贺
    赵沨
    听了中央乐团和中央广播乐团合唱队在星期音乐会上演出的贝多芬的第九交响乐，兴奋无已。想起大约二十年前，一个意大利指挥叫巴器的在上海也指挥过这部作品，但那是上海作为殖民地的市政机构附属的乐队演出的，只有几位中国音乐家参加了这次被称为“艺坛盛事”的演出。但是，在今天，中国的年青的指挥严良堃和同样是年轻的管弦乐队和合唱队（全团平均年龄不超过二十五岁），也演出了这部宏伟的经典著作了。我们当然不能说这次演出已经尽善尽美的了，但是，首都的音乐工作者以意气风发、斗志昂扬的姿态和精神，在大约一个多月的精心排练下，能够达到今天这样的成绩，这不能不归功于指挥严良堃的艰苦的工作态度，不能不庆贺全体艺术家们令人感动的成就。
    第一乐章一开始，那低沉有力的号召的主题在低音弦乐器一奏出来，立即把人吸引住了，主部的动机的下半句立即答复了这个号召，勇敢地回应着战斗的准备……整个演奏是那么专注那么朴实，欢愉的第二乐章和沉着的第三乐章都奏得一气呵成。第四乐章开始便成功地表达了那种崇高的情绪，而指挥把那个所谓贝多芬式的“口吃”（指乐曲突然的休止）处理得非常自然，赋予了即将出现的男中音的歌唱以近乎圣洁的氛围。必须提出男中音歌唱家魏启贤的演唱，他成功地歌唱了这个最吃重的独唱部分。
    指挥没有追求乐曲的外在的效果，他的每一个动作都体现了指挥这个交响乐最必需的品质之一——在节制中的热情。
    希望参加这次演出的音乐家们能够进一步地再精雕细刻一下，我们知道，像贝多芬的第九交响乐这样的作品，每一个章节中都还有许多乐旨的精髓需要去细致地推敲并找出表现的完美方式。比如说四重唱的高度的“合节”——对比中的统一，只有经过许多次的精心排练才能达到表现上的极致。但我们深信，我们是能达到这一境界的。
    衷心祝贺演出的成功！
