Xinhua News Agency report:

    Daxing Flour Mill in Zunyi has implemented an archive system for equipment maintenance and repair. For nearly four years, the machines have been operating normally without any major accidents.
    The Daxing Flour Mill was established eighteen years ago. Before 1955, due to the long service life of the machines and the lack of maintenance and repair systems, accidents occurred frequently. In order to completely change this situation, the factory, starting in the second half of 1955, while gradually establishing and improving the equipment maintenance system, decided, after discussions by the employees, to adopt the archive system method: Each component of the machine was recorded in detail according to its name, specifications, activation date, and each repair or replacement time. Then, the wear characteristics and patterns of the parts were found from these historical data. Based on the analysis, a repair plan, maintenance system, and feasible operating procedures were formulated for each component. As a result, accidents have been greatly reduced, and the old machines have been operating continuously and normally for more than forty months.

    大兴面粉厂实行设备维修档案制
    四年来机器运转正常没有发生重大事故
    据新华社讯　遵义大兴面粉厂在设备维护修理方面推行了档案制，近四年来，机器一直运转正常，没有发生重大事故。
    大兴面粉厂建厂十八年了，在1955年以前，由于机器使用年限较久，缺乏维护和修理制度，机器经常发生事故。厂里为了彻底改变这种状况，从1955年下半年起，在逐步建立和健全设备维修制度的同时，经职工们的讨论，决定采取档案制的方法：机器的每个部件，都按照名称、规格、启用日期、每次检修或更换时间，一一记载下来，然后从这些历史资料中找出机件的耗损特性和规律；根据分析，订出每个机件的检修计划、维护制度和可行的操作规程。这样一来，事故大大减少，老机器已经连续正常运转四十多个月了。
