Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 29th: The regional geological survey work of the eastern section of the Nanling Mountains, spanning the four provinces and autonomous regions of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi, has been basically completed after three years of effort by Soviet experts and Chinese geological personnel. The 1:200,000 geological and mineral maps, stratigraphic profile maps, and other materials that have been filled in completely mark rich data on minerals, strata, geotectonics, igneous rocks, landforms, and hydrology. It provides clues for mineral prospecting and provides a basis for the construction of electricity, water conservancy, and railways.

The area surveyed in the Nanling area includes more than 90,000 square kilometers in the eastern part south of the Five Ridges, of which Guangdong accounts for more than 70,000 square kilometers, about one-third of the province's area. In the high mountains, deep valleys, and hilly areas, hundreds of areas containing more than 20 kinds of minerals have been discovered, which accurately proves that the Nanling area is rich in various minerals, shattering the assertion that "there is no coal in the South."

The Nanling regional survey also provides rich data for scientific research. The discovery of ammonite fossils confirms that the Lower Jurassic marine transgression reached Nanling. The discovery of animal and plant fossils has also raised the question of whether Mesozoic coal formation was one or two geological periods, which is related to the amount of coal reserves and the direction of coal exploration. Nanling has a large area of the oldest Paleozoic strata. In the past, due to geological complexity and the lack of fossil evidence, it has been collectively referred to as the pre-Devonian strata – the Longshan Series – for 30 years. Now, the discovery of graptolite fossils and the identification of spore types have confirmed the existence of Ordovician and Cambrian strata. These scientific achievements have identified the relationship between mineralization and provided a basis for predicting coal, iron, oil, copper and other mineral resources. During the Nanling regional survey, young Chinese geological workers completed their tasks with the help of Soviet experts and learned the latest technical skills. Soviet experts personally participated in fieldwork and indoor work, enabling Chinese geologists to learn new methods for mineral exploration, such as heavy sand identification, hydrochemical sampling and analysis, metal content measurement, and spectroscopic analysis. In terms of work efficiency, it has also increased from 150 square kilometers per group (three people) per month to 450 square kilometers. The quality is basically good.

At the beginning of the Nanling regional survey, the Party dispatched a large number of Party member cadres to form regional survey teams. Together with young people who had just graduated from colleges and universities, they went to work in the field, learned from Soviet experts, relied on local Party committees, publicized to the masses, mobilized the masses to report mines, and inspected mine reporting points, so that the regional survey work could serve production more directly, and was therefore deeply welcomed by the masses. As the regional survey work came to an end, the cadre team also grew up. Many Party member cadres have changed from laymen to being familiar with the business and capable of undertaking production management and some technical work. All the old team members have also undertaken independent work tasks and have begun scientific research activities. Originally, there were ten teams conducting regional surveys in Nanling. Now, there are seven teams supporting the work in the eight provinces and autonomous regions of Guangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. In addition, there are dozens of technical cadres.

The more than 90,000 square kilometers of area that the Nanling regional survey team members have traveled through is the area that Chairman Mao mentioned in his Long March poem as "The Five Ridges meander like rippling waves." It is one of the areas with the most complex terrain and geological conditions in my country. For generations, the resources on and below the land have remained unclear. Old China left a pieced-together 1:1,000,000 geological map, which was only a geological overview and could not meet the needs of current production and scientific research at all. The completion of the regional geological survey of the eastern section of the Nanling Mountains provides valuable materials for filling the geological map of more than 9 million square kilometers across the country.

    南岭东段地质之谜揭晓
    中苏科学人员经三年努力画出精细地质矿产图
    新华社广州29日电　横跨广东、广西、湖南、江西四个省和自治区之间的南岭东段区域地质测量工作，在苏联专家和我国地质人员三年努力下，已经基本完成。在已经填好的二十万分之一的地质图和矿产图、地层剖面图等材料上，完整地标出了矿产、地层、大地构造、火成岩、地貌、水文等丰富资料。它提供了矿产普查的线索，而且使电力、水利、铁道等建设有了依据。
    南岭区测完成工作的地方，包括五岭以南东部九万多平方公里，其中广东占了七万多平方公里，约为全省面积三分之一。在高山、深谷和丘陵地中，发现了几百个共含有二十多种矿物的地区，确切地证明南岭地区蕴藏着丰富的多种矿产，粉碎了“南方无煤”的论断。
    南岭区测工作也为科学研究提供了丰富的资料。菊石化石的发现，证实下侏罗纪海侵到达南岭。由于动植物化石的发现，还提出了中生代成煤是一个或两个地质时代的问题，这是关系到煤储量多少与找煤的方向问题。南岭有大片最古老的古生代地层，过去，由于地质的复杂和找不到化石证据，三十年来，一直把它统称为前泥盆纪地层——龙山系。现在，由于笔石化石的发现和每次孢子的鉴定，已经证实有奥陶纪和寒武纪地层的存在了。这些科学上的成就，找出了成矿关系，为煤、铁、石油、铜等等矿产资源预测提供了根据。在南岭区测工作过程中，我国年轻的地质工作者在苏联专家帮助下完成了任务，并且学到了最新的技术本领。苏联专家们亲自参加野外工作和室内工作，使我国地质工作者学会了采用重砂鉴定、水化学取样和分析、金属量测量和光谱分析等新的办法，去寻找矿产。在工作效率上，也从每组（三人）每月测量一百五十平方公里提高到四百五十平方公里。质量基本良好。
    南岭区测刚开始时，党派出了大批党员干部组成区测队。他们同刚从大专学校毕业的青年人一起，到野外工作，向苏联专家学习，依靠地方党委，向群众宣传，发动群众报矿，检查报矿矿点等，使区测工作更直接地为生产服务，因而深受群众欢迎。在区测工作结束的同时，干部队伍也成长起来了。许多党员干部已从外行变成熟悉业务，能担负生产管理和一些技术工作。所有的老队员，也都已担负独立工作任务，并且开始科学研究活动。原来在南岭进行区测工作的是十个分队，现在只算到广西、湖南、福建、浙江、安徽、四川、云南、贵州八个省和自治区支援工作的就有七个队，另外还有几十名技术干部。
    南岭区测队员们走过的这九万多平方公里的地区，就是毛主席在长征诗中所说的“五岭逶迤腾细浪”的地方。它是我国地形和地质情况最复杂的地方之一。世世代代，土地上面和下面的资源一直弄不清。旧中国留下一张拼凑出来的百万分之一地质图，只是一个地质概览，完全不能满足目前生产和科学研究的需要。南岭东段区域地质测量工作的完成，为填好全国九百多万平方公里的地质图提供了有价值的材料。
