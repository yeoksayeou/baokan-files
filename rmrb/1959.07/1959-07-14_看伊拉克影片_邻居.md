Watching the Iraqi Film "Neighbors"
Xu Wewen

The art film "Neighbors," shown during the "Iraqi Republic Film Week," was completed shortly before the Iraqi revolution last year. Because this film truthfully reflected the depressed and painful life of the Iraqi people before the revolution, it was forbidden from being exported and distributed abroad by the then reactionary Nuri al-Said government.

Mr. Said in the film is a primary school teacher in Baghdad with a good heart. He likes to make friends and is very willing to help others, dreaming of living a comfortable life. However, in the era of reactionary rule, life is shrouded in dark shadows, and he cannot get any peace. The main plot of the film is that Mr. Said, with the help of a shoemaker, finds a new home and becomes a neighbor. However, due to a quarrel between the children, which almost cost the life of Said's youngest child, a gap arises between these two new friends. Ultimately, they achieve understanding after jointly recognizing the preciousness of friendship.

Although the story of the film is simple, its meaning is profound. Through the quarrel between the neighbor's children, it strongly highlights the fact that in that society, children from poor families did not have the opportunity to receive education. Even Mr. Said, as a teacher, could not get his own children into school. Therefore, the children had to treat the streets as their playground, and many disputes and quarrels arose. However, what could Mr. Said do? He could only answer his complaining wife with a sigh. Early in the film, we see Said forced to search everywhere in a city with a housing shortage for a new place to live because he cannot afford the expensive rent. He envies the quiet and elegant small houses, but he can only sigh at the buildings.

In another scene, Said asks the son of a waiter in a tavern why he is not in school, and the waiter replies that he needs him to work in the tavern. Doesn't he want his child to go to school? Said understands this sentiment. These mutually contrasting plots in the film express the worries and depression of people under the reactionary rule at the time.

As a teacher, Mr. Said always invites friends for a few drinks on the day he receives his salary, which is less of a hobby and more of a way to relieve his worries. This is not only true for intellectuals like Mr. Said, but we can also see the lives of some ordinary citizens drowning their sorrows in alcohol in other shots of the film. In that era, people could only gain strength in life through true friendship and mutual sympathy and help!

The film shows Said's sympathy for the shoemaker and his efforts to ask a doctor to treat him. Common fate connects them. At the same time, fate is also tormenting them: in the scenes after Said's child is accidentally injured by the shoemaker's child, we see that the Said family originally loved the shoemaker's kind deaf-mute daughter the most, and usually entrusted their beloved child to her care. But now, in Mr. Said's eyes, she has become a criminal. If the child's life cannot be saved, she will be hated by Said for the rest of her life. Therefore, she feels very uneasy. She wants to explain to Said that she is not the "murderer," but she cannot say a word. She runs wildly to the streets and riversides, but who can speak for her? She sadly returns to the original place and picks up the harmonica left on the ground by the child, blowing it a few times. At this moment, the painful and confused Said actually wants to pick up the brick that accidentally injured his child and smash it on the deaf-mute girl's head, but when he sees a pair of tearful eyes pleading for forgiveness, his hand can only fall weakly.

The film praises the shoemaker's simple, honest, and loyal qualities. He tolerates Said's misunderstanding of him, and he is confident in dispelling these misunderstandings. In the last scene, when Said's child walks past the shoemaker's door with shoes, he realizes that Said no longer asks him to repair shoes. So, he calls the child to stop, takes the shoes, and starts repairing them. He originally wanted to tell the child to keep it a secret from Said, but in the end, he personally delivers them to Said and says, "We shouldn't let the children's disputes hurt our friendship." The two friends finally smile at each other happily and cheerfully.

I believe that these descriptions that conform to the characters and the strong atmosphere of life are the successes of this film.

    看伊拉克影片“邻居”
    许蔚文
    在“伊拉克共和国电影周”映出的艺术片“邻居”是去年伊拉克革命前夕摄制完成的。由于这部影片真实地反映了革命前伊拉克人民生活的抑郁和痛苦情景，曾被当时反动的努里·赛义德政府禁止输往国外发行。
    影片中的赛义德先生，是有着一副好心肠的巴格达城的小学教师，他喜欢交朋友，很愿意帮助别人，幻想着安安逸逸地过个好日子。可是，在反动统治的年代里，生活被蒙上了黑暗的阴影，不能让他得到半点儿安宁。影片的主要剧情是赛义德先生得到了修理皮鞋工人的帮助，找到了新的住所，成为邻居；但因为孩子们之间的吵架，甚至于几乎断送了赛义德最小的孩子的生命，因而在这两个新朋友之间就有了隔阂。最终在共同认识到友谊的可贵之后取得了谅解。
    影片故事虽简单，寓意却深长。它通过了邻居孩子们之间的吵架，强烈地衬托出，在当时的社会里，贫穷人家的孩子，是得不到受教育的机会的，即使如赛义德先生身为教师，可是自己的孩子也进不了学校。因此，孩子们只好把街头巷尾作为自己的乐园，不少的争执和吵闹事件也因此而生。然而，赛义德先生有什么办法呢？他只好以叹气来回答抱怨自己的妻子。我们在影片开始不久的时候，就看到了赛义德因为付不起高贵的租金而被迫在房荒的城市里到处寻找新的栖身之所。他很羡慕幽静雅致的小洋房，但他只能望楼兴叹。
    在另外的一场戏里，赛义德问酒馆里服务员的儿子为什么不上学，服务员的回答是需要他在酒馆里帮工。难道他不想让孩子去读书吗，赛义德是很能理解这种心境的。影片这些相互衬托的情节中表达了人们在当时反动统治下的忧愁和苦闷的心情。
    作为教师的赛义德，每逢领到了薪金之日，总要请朋友喝几杯，与其说是他的嗜好，不如说是为了解愁。这不仅是像赛义德先生一样的知识分子如此，我们还可以从影片的另外几个镜头看到一些普通的小市民借酒浇愁的生活。处在那样的年代里，人与人之间只有在真正友谊和相互的同情、帮助之下获得生活的力量！
    影片通过赛义德对补鞋工人的同情，尽力去请医生为他治病，共同的命运联系着他们。同时命运也时刻在折磨着他们：在赛义德的孩子被补鞋工人的孩子误伤之后的几场戏里，我们看到，本来赛义德一家是最喜爱补鞋工人的好心的哑女儿的，平日就把最心爱的小孩子托付给她看管，但现在她在赛义德先生眼中成为一个罪人了，只要是小孩子的生命保不住，她就会被赛义德憎恨一辈子。因此，她感到非常惶恐，她想向赛义德表白她不是“凶手”，然而，她是无法说出半句话来，她狂奔到大街、河畔，可是谁能为她申述呢？她悲痛地回到了原来的地方，捡起了小孩子遗落在地上的口琴，吹了几声。就在这个时候，痛苦而迷惘的赛义德竟想拾起那块误伤过自己孩子的砖块往哑女的头上砸去，但是，当他看到了一双泪水盈眶的求恕的眼睛时，他的手只好软落下来了。
    影片歌颂了补鞋工人的淳朴、忠诚的优良品质，他容忍着赛义德对他的误会，他有信心去消除这些误会。在最后的一场戏里，当赛义德的孩子拿着鞋子走过补鞋工人的门前时，他意识到赛义德已经不再找他修理鞋子了，于是，他把孩子喊住，接过鞋子就动手修理起来。他本来想告诉孩子瞒着赛义德，但结果还是亲自去送给赛义德，并且对他说：“我们不应该为了孩子们的纠纷而伤了友谊。”两个朋友终于愉快、朗爽地相视而笑了。
    我认为这些合乎人物性格的描述，生活气息的浓厚，都是这部影片的成功之处。
