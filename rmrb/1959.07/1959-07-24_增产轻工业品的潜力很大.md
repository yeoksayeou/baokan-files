There is Great Potential for Increasing Light Industrial Goods Production

In the first half of this year, the production of light industrial goods in our country has seen significant development, with a total output value increasing by 30% compared to the same period last year. Among the main daily-use light industrial products, fourteen types have seen an increase in output of more than 10% to 30% compared to the same period last year. Moreover, the proportion of major products completing the annual plan generally exceeds any previous year. The quality of most products in June has also improved. The production of small items has also seen significant improvement. However, in order to further meet the ever-growing market demand, the light industry sector must, on the basis of the significant achievements made in production in the first half of the year, continue to carry out a mass movement for high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safety, and strive to produce more and better daily-use light industrial products in the second half of the year.

Daily-use light industry is the main component of the entire light industry and is very closely related to the lives of the broad masses of people, especially now. Because before liberation, many people did not have enough to eat or adequate clothing. Only a few people had the money to buy thermos bottles, enamel mugs, washbasins, rubber shoes, toothbrushes, toothpaste, flashlights, and cultural items such as fountain pens. The situation is very different now. More than 500 million farmers have joined the people's communes, and urban residents who are eligible for employment have also been employed. Those who have the money to buy daily-use light industrial products are no longer a small number, but hundreds of millions of people, and their purchasing power is gradually increasing with the development of industry and agriculture. On average, each person uses one more bar of soap per year, which seems insignificant, but added up across the country, it requires an increase of more than 600 million bars per year. The fact that the purchasing power of hundreds of millions of people is gradually increasing requires us to vigorously increase the production of light industrial products. At present, the state has determined the production plan for daily-use light industrial products for the second half of the year based on needs and possibilities. According to this plan, the output of many products will increase significantly compared to the first half of the year. The task of all employees in light industrial enterprises is to do everything possible to ensure the completion of the state plan in terms of quality, quantity, and variety. Only in this way can we appropriately meet the needs of the peak season market after autumn.

To ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the production increase plan for the second half of the year, what major tasks should the light industry sector focus on now?

First, do everything possible to tap the potential of raw materials and materials. The key problem currently existing in the production of daily-use light industry is not insufficient production capacity, but the supply of raw materials and materials cannot keep up with the needs of production development. We must have a correct understanding of the issue of raw materials and materials. On the one hand, we must see that the production of raw materials and materials cannot keep up with the development of processing industries. On the other hand, we must also see that there is great potential for saving raw materials and materials in current processing production. For example, caustic soda is currently felt to be in short supply, but many enterprises in the paper industry using sulfate wood pulp have not reached the required quota for alkali consumption. If the alkali consumption of these enterprises is reduced by 10% (which is entirely possible), more than 10,000 tons of alkali can be saved in the second half of this year. For example, in the paper industry, the amount of pulp used to make one ton of paper varies from 900 kilograms to 1,100 kilograms. If it all reaches the level of 900 kilograms of consumption, then 200,000 tons of paper can be produced this year. In the rubber shoe industry, promoting the advanced experience of producing microporous soles and two-color welts in one go, and changing the advanced experience of yuanbao rain boots from inverting the upper sole to the correct upper sole, not only ensures quality but also reduces the amount of rubber used per pair of shoes from 140 grams to 125 grams, that is, saving 15 grams of rubber per pair of shoes. In this way, producing one million pairs of shoes can increase the production of 120,000 pairs. The material yield rate of pencil wood, Beijing Sanxing Pencil Factory produces 33,000 pencils per cubic meter of raw wood, while Harbin Pencil Company only produces 24,000, a difference of 9,000. The phenomenon of uneven raw material and material consumption quotas, with considerable differences, exists in various industries. As long as we earnestly rely on the masses, learn from advanced factories, and strive to learn and promote advanced experience, and reduce consumption quotas on the premise of ensuring product quality, it is equivalent to increasing a large portion of raw materials and materials.

In addition to practicing strict economy, the main thing is to increase production, actively recover and utilize waste products and waste materials, and expand the sources of raw materials and materials. Who should increase production and purchase? The departments originally responsible for producing raw materials and materials, and the departments responsible for purchasing, have an unshirkable responsibility. However, light industry departments can also actively organize production and purchasing in a planned manner under unified arrangements. For example, paper-making enterprises can recover 60%-70% of waste alkali by slightly increasing some equipment. Using the surplus current of trams during low load and its standby electricity can also produce caustic soda, without much investment and equipment, as long as electrolytic cells are installed. The Ministry of Light Industry is already conducting pilot projects in Tianjin and Beijing. After success, cities with trams such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Dalian, Anshan, Wuhan, and Chongqing can organize production. In this way, the supply of caustic soda can be increased. Those who cannot produce it themselves can also organize local production and establish raw material and material supply bases in rural areas. 60% of light industry's raw materials come from rural areas. Light industry enterprises should actively sign raw material purchase and sales contracts with people's communes under the unified planning of the state and the unified arrangements of local party committees, adopting the method of fixed-point zoning. Shanghai Paper Mill established a base point for producing local grass pulp in the suburbs, and obtained more than 4,000 tons of grass pulp in the first quarter, which increased to more than 8,000 tons in the second quarter. Establishing raw material and material supply bases in rural areas is not only beneficial to light industrial production, but also increases the income of people's communes. This method is not only needed at present, but also needed in the future. Many light industrial enterprises in our country have a tradition of using waste and leftover materials from large enterprises for production, and now they should actively link up with relevant large enterprises under the unified arrangements of local party committees. In short, do not wait, make overall arrangements, rely on the masses, and do everything possible to expand the sources of raw materials and materials. From a long-term perspective, this is the fundamental way to solve the problem.

Second, focus on quality. Since the beginning of this year, the quality of daily-use light industrial products has generally been improving month by month. The product quality of some enterprises has improved faster, while that of others has improved more slowly, and has not yet reached the requirements stipulated by the state. There are various reasons for this. Some are because the variety and specifications of raw materials and materials do not fully meet the requirements, and some are because they have not given due attention to quality, always thinking that it does not matter whether the product quality is higher or lower, as long as the market needs it. This idea is incorrect. What does it mean if the product quality does not meet the stipulated requirements? It means that it has not reached the stipulated use value, or the efficiency is not high, or the use time is not long, and one cannot replace another. Such products cannot meet consumer demand. We must unify high yield, high quality, and low consumption, and seek high yield and low consumption on the premise of ensuring product quality. The principle of socialist enterprise management is: the more products are needed in large quantities, the more important it is to ensure the stipulated use value of the product. The requirements are especially strict for export products, industrial production products, precision products, and famous brand products. Products that do not meet the quality standards will not be allowed to leave the factory. For some general products, if the use value does not meet the state-stipulated requirements due to poor raw material quality, we must also honestly explain it with an attitude of being responsible to the country and consumers, and implement high quality and high price, and low quality and low price.

Third, focus on enterprise management and establish a good production order. The good production order we are talking about is a combination of high democracy and high concentration, an order that is conducive to both giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees and guiding the masses of employees to act in accordance with certain norms. For many enterprises, in addition to continuing to mobilize the masses and deeply carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy with high yield, high quality, and low consumption, the main thing at present is to rely on the masses to establish and improve the necessary rules and regulations. Such as various responsible systems in production management, various technical operating procedures in technical management, quality inspection systems for raw materials, materials, products, and semi-finished products, equipment maintenance and repair systems, various quota management systems in business management, raw material and material storage systems, material requisition and return systems, cost accounting systems, financial expenditure systems, etc. Only by establishing these systems and strictly implementing them can the vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy achieve the expected results, and achieve high output, good quality, low cost, and safe production.

Fourth, light industry leading organs at all levels must effectively manage all products and all enterprises in accordance with the principle of product-based management. It is necessary to manage large enterprises as well as small and medium-sized enterprises; to manage those produced by foreign methods as well as those produced by indigenous methods; and to manage mass-produced products as well as small-scale products. Only by managing them well can we arrange production uniformly in accordance with the state plan, lead them well, and provide guidance and assistance in technology and other aspects. There are many varieties of daily-use light industrial products, but precisely because they are numerous and diverse, they need to be managed even more. The socialist economy develops in a planned and proportional manner. Without managing products and enterprises, it is impossible to talk about planned and proportional development. We actively and proactively manage all enterprises and all products well, and incorporate them into the state planning track, so that we can actively organize production according to market needs, and better help enterprises improve their technology and improve their work.

At present, party committees at all levels are further strengthening their leadership over light industrial production, which is the most powerful guarantee for completing the plan. Various localities are also vigorously organizing the recovery of waste products and waste materials. The summer harvest of agriculture has basically ended, and the autumn harvest is in sight. The supply of raw materials and materials for daily-use light industrial products will gradually improve. The enterprises and personnel who originally transferred their careers have also returned to the team one after another, and the strength of production has been strengthened. It can be said that the current production situation of daily-use light industry is very favorable. We should seize this favorable opportunity, deeply carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy with high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safety, make a big effort, and produce more and better light industrial products to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    增产轻工业品的潜力很大
    今年上半年，我国轻工业品的生产又有很大的发展，生产总值比去年同期增长了30％。在主要的日用轻工业产品中，产量比去年同期增长10％到30％以上的有十四种，而且主要产品完成年度计划的比例，一般都超过以往任何一年。6月份绝大部分产品的质量，也有所提高。小产品生产的情况也有很大改进。但为了进一步满足日益增长着的市场需要，轻工业部门必须在上半年生产获得很大成绩的基础上，继续开展高产、优质、低耗、安全的群众运动，力争在下半年生产更多、更好的日用轻工业品。
    日用轻工业是整个轻工业的主要组成部分，跟广大人民的生活有着极密切的关系，特别是现在。因为在解放以前，许多人食不果腹，衣不蔽体，有钱买保温瓶、搪瓷口杯、面盆、胶鞋、牙刷、牙膏、手电筒，以及钢笔等文化用品的，只是少数人。现在的情况大不同了。五亿多农民加入了人民公社，城市有条件就业的居民也都就了业，有钱买日用轻工业品的，已经不再是少数人，而是几亿人民，并且购买力随着工农业的发展在逐步提高。平均每人每年多用一块肥皂，看来是微不足道的，可是全国加起来，每年就得增产六亿多块。几亿人民购买力逐步提高的事实，要求我们必须大力增产轻工业品。现在，国家已经根据需要与可能，确定了下半年日用轻工业品的生产计划。按照这个计划，许多产品的产量比上半年还有很大的增长。轻工业企业全体职工的任务，就是千方百计地保证按质、按量、按品种完成国家计划。这样，才能适当地满足秋后旺季市场的需要。
    要保证完成和超额完成下半年的增产计划，轻工业部门当前要抓哪些主要工作呢？
    一是千方百计地挖掘原料、材料的潜力。当前日用轻工业生产中存在的关键问题，不是生产能力不足，而是原料、材料的供应赶不上生产发展的需要。对原料、材料的问题，我们要有正确的认识。一方面要看到当前原料、材料的生产还赶不上加工工业的发展，另一方面又看到目前加工生产中节约原料、材料的潜力很大。例如烧碱，目前大家都感到供应不足，但是造纸工业中许多企业硫酸盐木浆的耗碱量，都没有达到应有的定额。如果这些企业的耗碱量都降低10％（这是完全可以做到的），今年下半年就可以节约一万多吨碱。又如造纸工业中造一吨纸所用纸浆有的用九百公斤，有的用一千一百公斤，如果都达到九百公斤消耗的水平，那末，今年就可以增产二十万吨纸张。胶鞋工业，推广微孔大底、二色围条一次出型的先进经验，元宝雨鞋改反上大底为正上大底的先进经验，既保证质量，又可使每双鞋的用胶量由一百四十克降低到一百二十五克，即每双鞋节约胶十五克，这样每生产一百万双鞋就可以增产十二万双。铅笔用原木的出材料率，北京三星铅笔厂每立米原木出铅笔三万三千支，而哈尔滨铅笔公司只出二万四千支，相差九千支。原料、材料消耗定额参差不齐，相差相当大的现象，各个行业都有。只要我们切实地依靠群众，向先进厂看齐，努力学习和推广先进经验，在确保产品质量的前提下，把消耗定额降低下来，就等于增加很大一部分原料、材料。
    厉行节约以外，主要的是增加生产，积极回收和利用废品、废料，扩大原料、材料的来源。由谁来增产和收购呢？原来负责生产原料、材料的部门、负责收购的部门是责无旁贷的。但是，轻工业部门也可以在统一安排下，有计划地积极组织生产和收购。例如，造纸企业稍为增加一些设备，可以回收60％—70％的废碱。利用电车低负荷时的多余电流及其备用电也可以生产烧碱，而且不需要多少投资和设备，只要安上电解槽就行。现在轻工业部已经在天津、北京进行试点，成功以后，北京、天津、上海、沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、大连、鞍山、武汉、重庆等有电车的城市，都可以组织生产。这样烧碱的供应，就可以增加。自己不能生产的，还可以组织地方生产，在农村建立原料、材料供应基地。轻工业有60％的原料来自农村。轻工业企业应该在国家统一规划和地方党委统一安排下采取定点划片的办法，积极和人民公社签订原料购销合同。上海市造纸厂在郊区建立了生产土草浆基点，第一季度就得到了四千多吨草浆，第二季度就提高到八千吨以上。在农村建立原料、材料供应基地，既有利于轻工业生产，又能增加人民公社的收入。这种办法，不但是目前所需要的，也是将来所需要的。我国许多轻工业企业都有利用大企业废料、边料生产的传统，现在都应该在地方党委的统一安排下，积极和有关大企业挂钩。总之，不要等待，要统筹安排，依靠群众，想尽一切办法扩大原料、材料的来源，从长远看，这是解决问题的根本办法。
    二是抓质量。今年以来，日用轻工业品的质量，总的趋势是一个月比一个月的好。其中有些企业的产品质量提高得较快，有些则提高得比较慢，直到现在还没有达到国家规定的要求。这里有各种各样的原因。有的是因为原料、材料的品种、规格不完全合乎要求，有的是因为对质量没有给以应有重视，总以为产品质量高些低些没关系，反正市场需要。这种想法是不正确的。产品质量达不到规定的要求是什么意思呢？就是没有达到规定的使用价值，或者是效能不高，或者是使用的时间不长，一个不能顶一个用。这种产品是不能满足消费者要求的。我们必须把高产、优质、低耗统一起来，在保证产品质量的前提下求高产和低耗。社会主义企业经营的原则是：越是需要量很大的产品，越要保证产品规定的使用价值。对于出口产品、工业生产用品、精密产品和名牌产品，要求尤其严格，质量不合格的就不让出厂。有些一般产品，确实由于原料、材料质量不好，使用价值达不到国家规定要求的，我们也要以对国家负责、对消耗者负责的态度，老老实实地讲清楚，实行优质优价，低质低价。
    三是抓企业管理，建立良好的生产秩序。我们所讲的良好的生产秩序，是高度的民主和高度的集中相结合，是既有利于发挥广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，又能引导职工群众按照一定规范去行动的秩序。对于许多企业来说，目前除了继续发动群众，深入开展高产、优质、低耗的增产节约运动以外，主要是依靠群众建立和健全必要的规章制度。如生产管理方面的各种负责制度、技术管理方面的各种技术操作规程、原料、材料、产品和半成品的质量检验制度、设备维护和检修制度、经营管理方面的各种定额管理制度、原料、材料保管制度、领料退料制度、成本核算制度、财务开支制度等等。只有建立了这些制度，并且严格地贯彻执行，才能使轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动收到预期的效果，做到产量高、质量好、成本低、生产又安全。
    四是要各级轻工业领导机关按照产品归口管理的原则，切实把所有的产品、所有的企业都好好管起来。既要管大型企业，又要管中小型企业；既要管洋法生产的，又要管土法生产的；既要管大宗生产的产品，又要管小宗生产的产品。管起来了，才好按照国家计划统一安排生产，才好领导，才好在技术等各方面给以指导和帮助。日用轻工业品品种繁多，但唯其多和杂，就更需要管。社会主义经济是有计划按比例发展的，不把产品管起来，不把企业管起来，就谈不上有计划按比例发展。我们积极地主动地把所有的企业、所有的产品都好好管起来，把它们纳入国家计划轨道，就能主动按照市场需要组织生产，更好地帮助企业提高技术，改进工作。
    现在，各级党委都在进一步加强对轻工业生产的领导，这是完成计划的最有力的保证。各个地方也正在大力组织废品废料的回收，农业夏收已基本结束，秋收在望，日用轻工业品的原料、材料供应将逐步好转，原来转了业的企业和人员，也都陆续归了队，生产的力量加强了。可以说，目前日用轻工业的生产的形势是十分有利的。我们应当抓住这个有利时机，深入开展高产、优质、低耗、安全的增产节约运动，大干一场，生产更多更好的轻工业品，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
