Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th: Jishan County, Shanxi Province, achieved a bumper wheat harvest this year. The total output of wheat from the county's more than 760,000 mu of land increased by 64.6% compared to last year, and the average yield per mu also increased by 92.9% compared to last year.

Jishan County has a high terrain, and more than 90% of its land is highland dry land. The wheat yield in previous years generally did not exceed 130 jin. Last autumn, the county realized the people's commune system. The Jishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party fully utilized the favorable conditions of the people's communes and led the masses to implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in accordance with local conditions to change the low-yield situation. In this struggle, the county committee first mobilized various communes to establish mass experimental fields - "small farms," and used the successful experience of the experimental fields to guide large-scale field production. Most of the county's wheat fields were deeply ploughed to a depth of about eight inches, and an average of more than 8,000 jin of base fertilizer was applied per mu, more than double that of previous years. The sowing amount was about 30 jin per mu for irrigated land and about 20 jin per mu for dry land, basically achieving rational close planting. During the wheat growing season, the communes strengthened field management. More intensive management was applied to the third-class seedlings, which accounted for 25% of the total wheat field area, adopting measures such as more topdressing, more harrowing, and more weeding, quickly bringing the third-class seedlings up to the level of the first-class seedlings. This ensured a comprehensive bumper harvest of wheat throughout the county.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th: Lutai State Farm's wheat achieved a bumper harvest. The farm's 6,971.7 mu of wheat were all harvested and threshed by combine harvesters in twelve days. Now they have been dried, winnowed, weighed, and stored in the warehouse. According to the total number in the warehouse, the average yield of wheat per mu is 452.16 jin, an increase of 67% compared to last year. Among them, the 5,533.7 mu of large-scale high-yield fields had an average yield of 511.66 jin per mu, and a one-mu high-yield experimental field yielded 1,658 jin per mu.

Lutai Farm is located on the coast of the Bohai Sea in Hangu District, Tianjin. The terrain is low-lying, and the soil has a high salt and alkali content. In the past, there was no habit of planting wheat on a large scale locally, and some were only planted in scattered high-lying areas and vegetable gardens. Lutai Farm began trial planting as early as 1951, but the yield per mu was only 38.4 jin. Later, through crop rotation, freshwater leaching of alkali, and increased application of organic fertilizers, the soil gradually improved. By 1953, the wheat yield per mu reached 200 jin, and in 1958, the yield per mu further leaped to 270 jin.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 15th: More than 6,330 mu of wheat in Jianggezhuang People's Commune, Yantai City, Shandong Province, have achieved large-scale high yields. After verification, inspection, and weighing by the Yantai Municipal Party Committee's working group, the average yield per mu was 505 jin, an increase of 2.3 times compared to last year's 153 jin per mu.

Jianggezhuang Commune is located at the foot of Kunyu Mountain and is a semi-mountainous, semi-hilly area, in which the barren hills, sandy beaches, and mountain ridges account for 65% of the cultivated land area. Therefore, the average wheat yield in previous years was only about 150 jin. This year, the commune's wheat achieved a large-scale high yield, mainly because it implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" according to local characteristics.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th: The Dongyuan Production Team of the Xin'anbao Commune in Huailai County achieved a bumper harvest of winter wheat this year on 103 mu of land in the high and cold area outside the Great Wall. After verification, the average yield per mu was 408 jin, of which 17.9 mu of high-yield wheat reached 540 jin per mu. Recently, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Agricultural Production Committee held an on-site meeting in Xin'anbao with representatives from various counties, communes, and production teams to study and promote their experience.

    高坡旱地小麦增产
    稷山小麦总产量比去年提高64.6％
    芦台农场近七千亩盐碱地小麦亩产452斤
    本报太原15日电　山西稷山县今年小麦获得了大丰收。全县七十六万多亩小麦，总产量比去年产量提高了64.6％，平均每亩产量也比去年提高了92.9％。
    稷山县地势高，90％以上的土地是高坡旱地，历年的小麦产量一般都不超过一百三十斤。去年秋种时，全县实现了人民公社化。中共稷山县委充分发挥了人民公社的有利条件，领导群众因地制宜地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，改变低产面貌。在这一斗争中，县委首先发动各公社建立了群众性的试验田——“小农场”，用试验田的成功经验，指导大田生产。全县绝大部分麦田深翻八寸左右，平均每亩施底肥八千多斤，超过了往年一倍多。播种量水地每亩三十斤左右，旱地二十斤左右，基本上作到了合理密植。小麦生长期中，各公社都加强了田间管理。对占麦田总面积25％的三类苗，管得更勤，采取多追肥、多耙耧、多锄草的办法，很快使三类苗赶上了一类苗。这样，就保证全县小麦获得了全面大丰收。
    据新华社天津15日电　国营芦台农场的小麦获得大丰收。全场六千九百七十一亩七分小麦，用联合收割机在十二天内全部抢割脱粒完毕，现在已晒干扬净，过磅入库。根据入库总数计算，平均亩产小麦四百五十二点一六斤，比去年增产67％。其中五千五百三十三亩七分大面积丰产田，平均亩产五百十一点六六斤，一亩丰产试验田，亩产一千六百五十八斤。
    芦台农场位于天津市汉沽区渤海沿岸，地势低洼，土壤含盐含碱量高。过去当地没有大量种植小麦的习惯，有的仅在零星高地、菜园内种植。芦台农场早在1951年就开始试种，但亩产仅有三十八点四斤。以后经过水旱轮作、淡水洗碱和增施有机肥料等，土壤逐渐得到改良，到1953年，小麦亩产达到两百斤，1958年亩产量进一步跃进到二百七十斤。
    据新华社济南15日电　山东烟台市姜格庄人民公社六千三百三十多亩小麦，获得大面积丰产。这六千多亩小麦，经中共烟台市委工作组验收、验打、过秤核实，平均亩产五百零五斤，比去年每亩一百五十三斤增加二点三倍。
    姜格庄公社位于昆嵛山下，是一个半山、半丘陵地区，其中土质瘠薄的丘岭、沙滩和山塂即占耕地面积的65％，因此，历年小麦平均产量只有一百五十斤左右。今年，这个公社的小麦获得大面积丰产，主要是根据当地特点贯彻了农业“八字宪法”。
    据新华社天津15日电　怀来县新保安公社东园生产小队，今年在长城外高寒地带试种的一百零三亩冬小麦获得丰收。经过核实，平均亩产四百零八斤，其中有十七亩九分丰产麦亩产达到五百四十斤。最近，张家口市农业生产委员会，在新保安召开了有各县、公社、生产队代表参加的现场会，研究和推广他们的经验。
