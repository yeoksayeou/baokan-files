    Talking about "Scholars Raising Pigs"
    Liu Feng
    On Chenxu Street in Siyang, Jiangsu, a place abundant in pigs, I saw a large slogan written in white lime: "Farming without raising pigs is like a scholar without reciting books." In another place, I saw a couplet-style slogan: "To grow crops, you must raise pigs; to learn culture, you must recite books."
    Recently, many organizations, schools, enterprises, and military units across the country have been raising pigs, growing vegetables, and vigorously developing non-staple food production. In this way, it is not just farmers who are raising pigs; "scholars" have also started raising pigs.
    Generally speaking, most scholars do not know how to raise pigs, but they all love to eat pork. Confucius was a person who loved to eat meat very much. He once said: "From those who offer me dried meat as tuition, I have never refused to teach." "Dried meat" refers to bundled dried meat, probably equivalent to today's bacon and ham. If translated into today's language, it would be: "As long as someone sends me a few hams, I will teach them no matter who they are." Since then, sending teachers ham and bacon has become a rule. Later, even if you sent the teacher cash, it was called "tuition". In this way, pork has formed an indissoluble bond with intellectuals such as scholars.
    However, they never raised pigs. They only knew how to eat, or discuss the taste, nutrition, etc. It was not until the Party led the Chinese revolution that the situation of scholars only eating pigs but not raising them changed. As early as fifteen years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong called on organizations, troops, and schools in the base areas to raise pigs and grow vegetables, launching a vigorous large-scale production movement and holding various production undertakings. Many scholars in Yan'an and other liberated areas have become experts in raising pigs. Recently, under the call of the Party, some organizations have established farms and pig farms, and many scholars have become "pig herders." This is a good phenomenon. This matter greatly encouraged the enthusiasm for raising pigs in rural areas. Unfortunately, a few people have completely different reactions. After hearing the news that pig and vegetable farming were being developed in the suburbs of the city, they breathed a sigh of relief, saying: "The countryside doesn't have to raise so many pigs anymore." In my opinion, this kind of relaxed thinking is undesirable.
    We must implement the principle of "walking on two legs" in any work we do, and the same is true in the pig-raising industry. If scholars raise pigs, farmers should raise even more pigs. Because raising pigs is not only for supplying meat to the market, but mainly for increasing fertilizer, which is a treasure for abundant grain harvests, and also for increasing the income of commune members. Furthermore, while implementing the principle of self-reliance in pig and vegetable farming in cities and towns, we must not weaken the production of non-staple foods such as pig and vegetable farming in the vast rural areas. On the contrary, we must continue to strengthen production, and should sell and transfer supplies to cities according to plan. The supply of non-staple foods from rural areas to cities not only meets the daily needs of urban people, but also meets the requirements of farmers to exchange agricultural and sideline products for daily necessities and means of production. The fundamental way to solve the supply of non-staple foods in cities lies in the simultaneous development of urban and rural areas and the active development of non-staple food production. There is obviously a primary and secondary distinction here, which is by no means equal. Continuing to vigorously develop sideline production such as pig raising in the vast rural areas and actively supporting cities is the main thing; on the other hand, in cities, we must resolutely implement the principle of "self-reliance as the main thing, and striving for external assistance as a supplement." However, since our organizations, troops, factories, and schools only raise pigs and grow vegetables as an amateur activity, using spare time, it cannot affect work, production and learning, ... so there must also be some restrictions.
    "To grow crops, you must raise pigs; to learn culture, you must read books." Now, "scholars" who do not grow crops are also raising pigs, adding a strong new force to the pig-raising industry. This is a great thing, and the commune members who are engaged in pig raising as a career will undoubtedly be encouraged by this news. Let everyone supervise and encourage each other, and see who can raise pigs better.

    谈“秀才养猪”
    刘丰
    我在盛产猪只的江苏泗阳的陈圩大街上，看到了用白石灰写的“种田不养猪，如同秀才不讲书”的大字标语。在另外一个地方，我又看到了一个对联式的口号：“种庄稼要养猪，学文化要讲书。”
    最近一些时候，全国各地许多机关、学校、企业、部队等都在养猪、种菜，大搞副食品生产。这样一来，就不仅仅是种田的人养猪了，“秀才”们也养起猪来了。
    一般地说，秀才大多是不会养猪的，可是却都爱吃猪肉。孔老夫子就是一个很爱吃肉的人，他曾说：“自行束修以上，吾未尝无诲焉。”束修就是成捆的肉干，大概相当于今天的腊肉、火腿之类。如果翻译成今天的话来说，那就是：“只要是谁送我几只火腿，不管是谁我都教他。”自此以后，送老师火腿、腊肉就成了一个规矩，再后来，即使送老师现金，也称之为“束修”了。这样，猪肉就和秀才之类的知识分子结下了不解之缘。
    可是，他们从来就不养猪，他们只知道吃，或议论议论味道如何，营养怎样等等。直到党领导了中国革命，才改变了秀才只吃猪不养猪的情况。远在十五年前，毛泽东同志就号召根据地的机关、部队、学校养猪种菜，展开了轰轰烈烈的大生产运动，举办了各种各样的生产事业。延安及其他一些解放区的秀才，很多人都成为养猪的能手。最近在党的号召下，一些机关纷纷建立了农场、猪场，许多秀才也做起了“猪倌”，这是好现象。这件事大大鼓舞了农村的养猪热情。可惜，有少数人却有着完全不同的反应，他们在听到城市近郊发展养猪种菜事业的消息后，就如释重负大大地松了一口气说：农村这下子可不要再养那么些猪了。我看，这种松劲的想法要不得。
    我们做任何工作，都要贯彻两条腿走路的方针，在养猪事业中也不例外。秀才养猪，种田人就更要养猪。因为养猪不只是为了供应市场的肉食，最主要是为了增加肥料，这是粮食丰产的宝贝，也为了增加社员的收入。再说，目前在城市和集镇实行自立更生为主的养猪种菜方针的同时，丝毫也不能削弱广大农村的养猪种菜等副食品生产，相反的，还要继续加强生产，并且应当按照计划出售，按照计划外调供应城市。农村的副食品供应城市，不仅符合城市人民日常生活的需要，而且也符合农民以农、副产品换取日用工业品和生产资料的要求。解决城市副食品的供应问题的根本途径，在于城乡并举，积极发展副食品生产。这里显然有主次之别，绝不等于平分秋色。在广大农村继续执行大力发展养猪等副业生产，积极支持城市，这是主要的；另方面在城市里，也要坚决实行“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针。虽然如此，但由于我们机关、部队、工厂、学校，养猪、种菜只是业余性质，利用业余时间进行，不能影响工作、生产和学习，……所以也不能不有所限制。
    “种庄稼要养猪，学文化要读书”，现在不种庄稼的“秀才”们也养起猪来，在养猪事业中增加了一支强大的生力军，这是一件大大的好事，以养猪为业的公社社员看了这消息，不用说是会受到鼓舞的。让大家互相督促互相砥砺，看谁把猪养得更好。
