Leap Forward
—Notes and Impressions from Hongguang Commune, Part 1
Tian Liu
Since its establishment in September of last year, the People's Commune has gone through autumn harvest, winter production, spring production, and summer harvest. It has already “experienced the cold and heat, and completed a full cycle.” What kind of impact has communization brought to the countryside? How does the production of the People's Commune differ from that of agricultural cooperatives? What changes have taken place in people's lives? To find answers to these questions, we conducted a short investigation at the Pixian People's Commune in Sichuan Province. The following are some of the actual situations we saw and heard at the Hongguang People's Commune.

		A Difference

When we departed from Beijing, we originally planned to first look at the growth of wheat. However, when we arrived at the Hongguang People's Commune on June 8th, the fields were already a lush green. Not only had the wheat been harvested long ago, but the transplanting of early and mid-season rice had also been completed. "This can be considered a difference," said the secretary of the commune's Party committee, "In previous years, transplanting only began after the Grain in Ear (芒种) season, but this year it was finished just after the Grain in Ear. The specifications and quality have also been greatly improved." For several days, we went to the fields to look at the rice seedlings. How deep was the plowing, and how much base fertilizer was applied? We didn't see it, but judging from the growth of the seedlings, "plowing eight or nine inches deep and applying one hundred loads of base fertilizer" is entirely believable. This year, the density of rice planting here has been increased compared to last year, and all are improved varieties. Last year, the planting specifications were generally a hill spacing of five or six inches, a row spacing of eight inches, or a hill spacing and row spacing of seven inches, with about 15,000 to 20,000 hills per mu. This year, 70% of the rice fields are densely planted with a hill spacing of three inches and a row spacing of seven inches, and about 10% of the fields are used as experiments with a hill spacing of two inches and a row spacing of seven inches. The rest are planted with a hill spacing of four inches and a row spacing of eight inches, with 20,000 to 50,000 hills per mu. 70% of all rice fields have between 40,000 and 50,000 hills per mu. After tillering, there will be 300,000 to 600,000 panicles per mu. The number of effective plants will increase by nearly double compared to last year. When we left the Hongguang Commune at the end of June, the early rice was heading, and the mid-season rice had already jointed and tillered. Judging from the growth, each stalk is thick and each leaf is upright. It is entirely possible to obtain a higher yield than last year's 1,020 jin per mu.

What about the yield of rapeseed and wheat? To catch up with the season and finish transplanting early and mid-season rice earlier, the commune has not yet completely threshed the wheat. The total yield and the unit area yield have not yet been finally calculated. However, one thing is already clear: an unprecedented bumper harvest. This can be seen from the commune's sale of surplus grain. Last summer, the total amount of surplus grain sold in Pixian County was 7 million jin of wheat. This year, the Hongguang People's Commune alone is 7 million jin. One commune is equal to the total amount of surplus grain sold by the entire county during the agricultural cooperative period last year, three times higher than the number of surplus grain sold by the commune itself last year (1.75 million jin). How is an unprecedented bumper harvest possible without it! Initially, we thought that only the Hongguang Commune had particularly good production development this year, and other communes were probably not like this. Later, after learning about the situation, the situation in the whole county was roughly similar. This summer, Pixian County sold a total of 24 million jin of surplus grain (wheat), also 2.5 times higher than last year's 7 million jin.

Did they sell too much grain? After selling the surplus grain, did the commune keep enough seeds for the coming year, and did the members keep enough food grain?

"Enough, and there's still plenty left over," the commune cadres replied.

"Even if we leave ten or twenty jin of wheat less, we can guarantee that everyone will be full and well-fed before the rice harvest," said the staff of the public canteen.

"How could it not be enough!" the commune members said.

The specific situation of the 12th Management District of Hongguang Commune proves that the above statements are correct. This management district plans to plant 2,000 mu of wheat next year (this year it was 1,570 mu), keeping a total of 80,000 jin of seeds, averaging 40 jin per mu. After selling the surplus grain and keeping enough seeds, each commune member still has an average of 60 jin of wheat, plus 20 jin of buckwheat and 200 jin of potatoes (converted to 50 jin of grain), totaling 130 jin. Early rice will be harvested in early August. There are fifty days from mid-June to early August, which means that adults and children have an average of 2.5 jin of grain per day. No wonder the commune members said, "How could it not be enough!"

The situation of rapeseed is roughly similar to that of wheat, or even better.

		Three Reasons

The summer harvest crops of the Hongguang People's Commune were able to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest. In addition to the superior conditions common to other communes, such as the large scale of the People's Commune and abundant human and material resources, which make it possible to cultivate intensively, and in addition to more meticulously and comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for increasing agricultural production than in the past, there are also the following three specific reasons: First, the policy of multiple high-yield and high-income crops was correctly implemented; second, the irrigation system and irrigation conditions were improved; and third, land leveling and land planning work were done relatively well.

This year's bumper harvest of summer crops in the Hongguang Commune is mainly composed of two elements: the expansion of sown area and the increase in unit yield. Among them, the expansion of sown area played a major determining role. Taking the 12th Management District as an example, from the part of the wheat field that has been threshed, the average yield per mu is about 450 jin, an increase of about 20% compared to last year's yield of 370 jin per mu. However, since their sown area increased from more than 1,100 mu last year to 1,570 mu this year, the total output will increase by about 70% compared to last year. Therefore, the cadres and masses here fully support the central government's proposed policy of "both increasing the yield per unit area and expanding the sown area to achieve multiple high-yield and high-income crops," and are determined to increase the multiple cropping index by another 20% this year. Pixian is located in the core area of the western Sichuan Plain, with a suitable climate and good water conservancy conditions. The multiple cropping index has been relatively high over the years, and has been developing year by year under the advocacy of the Party. Last year, the county's multiple cropping index had already increased from 175% in the early days of liberation to 270%. The Hongguang Commune even reached 300%. Although the labor force was very tight due to the Great Leap Forward in steel production last autumn plowing and sowing season, the sown area of wheat was still expanded as much as possible. However, another situation occurred this spring. Due to an incomplete understanding of the central government's proposed policy of "sowing less, yielding more, and harvesting more," which can only be achieved through long-term struggle, some management districts and production teams reduced a part of the sown area. Last year, the 12th Management District had a total of 2,400 mu of double-cropping early rice, but this year only had more than 900 mu. After the publicity and instructions of the higher-level Party committee, especially the education and inspiration of the fact of the wheat bumper harvest, people decided to make up for the loss of sowing less in the spring by expanding the area of mid-season, late-season rice and late autumn crops. Determined to increase the multiple cropping index from 303% last year to 320%, and increase the rice planting area from 80% of the total cultivated area last year to 95%. Now, this management district has planted 7,000 mu of mid-season rice, more than double the 3,400 mu last year, and will expand the sown area of late rice and late autumn crops as much as possible.

Improving the irrigation system and irrigation conditions is another important reason why the Hongguang People's Commune achieved a great summer harvest. The Hongguang Commune is located in the famous Dujiangyan irrigation area in the western Sichuan Plain. Almost all of the land can be irrigated by gravity flow. In principle, there should be no problem with the "water" aspect of the "Eight-Character Charter." However, this is not the case. In the past, under the control of feudal landlords and the influence of the individual economy, the configuration of irrigation ditches was very unreasonable. After liberation, although this situation improved year by year due to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, because the scale of agricultural cooperatives was small, only a certain degree of improvement could be made within a small range, and it could not be fundamentally improved, let alone fully utilize water conservancy to serve people's production and life in many ways. According to a survey, when the Hongguang Commune was first established last year, there were more than 10,000 irrigation channels crisscrossing the commune's land. According to actual needs, 5,000 channels would have been sufficient. Since the establishment of the commune, they have been working to change these substandard channels. This is a very large project, and although it will take some time to finally complete, great achievements have been made in the past six months. As of mid-June, in addition to closing some unnecessary and redundant ditches, more than 20 sluice gates have been built on several main trunk canals, strengthening people's ability to control water. The commune members said, "Now, water is available whenever it is needed, as much as is needed and as little as is needed." Irrigation conditions have been greatly improved, and the cultivated area has been increased by more than 100 mu due to the appropriate reduction of redundant channels. While improving the channels and building sluice gates, the commune also built four power stations and more than 150 water mills. Now, not only do some commune members have electric lights in their homes, but the food processing for more than 70,000 people and the feed processing for tens of thousands of pigs in the entire commune are solved by hydropower stations and water mills. They have also processed more than 10 million jin of grain for the state, and the commune has increased its income by more than 100,000 yuan.

Doing a good job of land processing, leveling the land well, carrying out land planning, and implementing rational planting are all well-known ways to increase production. However, before communization, due to various conditional constraints, it was not always possible to achieve it well. As soon as the Hongguang Commune was established, people tightly grasped this point. While transforming the irrigation system, they vigorously carried out land leveling and consolidation work, turning the "tofu" fields of three to five mu each in the past into large fields of 40 to 100 mu, fundamentally changing the situation that "the plains are not suitable for mechanized farming." More than 50% of the wheat fields are deeply plowed by tractors. According to the experience here over the years, land plowed by tractors can generally increase production by about 20% compared to manual plowing because it is plowed deeper and can seize the season. While leveling the land, land use planning was carried out. According to the characteristics of "large scale and high degree of public ownership" of the People's Commune, and according to the principles of "unified leadership, hierarchical management, and hierarchical accounting," each management district of the Hongguang Commune has made land planning, crop planting planning, and seed planning. This year's summer harvest crops were planted in accordance with these plans. This not only made better use of the land due to "planting according to the land" and increased the yield per unit area, but also created very good conditions for future crop rotation and improving soil fertility. Although this year is the first year that the commune has implemented these plans, and these plans still have imperfections and unreasonable aspects, the direction is correct, and the benefits are very obvious. As long as we persevere and constantly revise and supplement them in practice, we will definitely achieve more and more significant production increases.

Of course, the reasons for the Hongguang Commune's great summer harvest are not limited to these. For example, the promotion of advanced farming techniques, the strong leadership of the Party, and in-depth political and ideological work are all very important reasons. We plan to introduce these issues separately, so we won't talk about them too much here.

		Diversified Operations

With the agricultural production of the Hongguang Commune developing so rapidly, how is the diversified economy developing? Let's look at the facts first: Now the commune has three main production industries: industry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, as well as some forestry and fishery. If calculated by industry, the commune operates more than 60 kinds of production industries. Among them, industry includes farm tool machinery manufacturing and repair factories, local chemical fertilizer and pesticide factories, coal mining, lime kilns, as well as wild fiber and brewing factories, and grain processing factories. There are more than 240 factories of all sizes, more than 60% of which were established after communization. Although the diversification of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries has not increased much in terms of operating projects compared with before communization, the scale and development speed cannot be compared with the past. Calculating from their total output value, it has increased at least three times compared to before communization. The diversified economy of the Hongguang Commune (including industry but not including pig and vegetable production) has one characteristic: the self-sufficient production that serves the commune's agricultural production and the commune members' lives accounts for the vast majority, reaching more than 90% in terms of output value, while commodity production accounts for less than 10%. Although the conditions in each region are different, this ratio should not be exactly the same. However, judging from the current human and material conditions of the commune, from the current level of development of productive forces, and from the commune's current main task of developing agricultural production, this ratio is appropriate. It is this less than 10% of commodity-based diversified economy that increased the commune's cash income by 450,000 yuan in four months from November of last year to February of this year. The total monthly salary of the entire commune is 120,000 yuan, which is just about enough to pay the salaries. After February, the commune implemented hierarchical management and hierarchical accounting. The income situation has not yet been calculated, but judging from the specific situation of several management districts, it is completely no problem to use the income from commodity-based diversified economy to pay salaries in addition to self-sufficiency. Since the implementation of the distribution system combining wages and supply in November last year, wages have been paid every month except in March, when the commune members voluntarily used their wages as production investment to buy fertilizer. Less than 10% of commodity-based diversified economy can bring in 450,000 yuan in four months, so the output value of the entire diversified economy is not 4.5 million yuan! And in 1957 before communization (the income from diversified economy was less last year before communization due to large-scale agricultural production and basic construction), the total income for the whole year was only 439,000 yuan. As for the role of self-sufficient diversified economy in the commune's agricultural production and the commune members' lives, it is difficult to say completely at once. Only from one or two examples of commune-run industries can we get a glimpse of its outline in supporting agricultural production. For example, by the end of April, the chemical fertilizer and pesticide factory had produced 300 jin of local chemical fertilizer and 20 jin of pesticide per mu for all the commune's land (120,000 mu); the farm tool factory made many new-style farm tools. Not counting the rope traction machines used during the autumn plowing last year, the factory made more than 40 threshing machines alone this summer harvest. This kind of threshing machine is powered by electricity from hydropower stations or tractors, and four of them can match the efficiency of a combine harvester. The 12th Management District uses the turbine of a water mill to drive the threshing machine, which can also thresh 300 jin per hour, while people can only thresh 30 to 50 jin per day using a flail or a mixing barrel.

		Several Methods

The diversified economy of the Hongguang People's Commune has been able to develop so rapidly mainly due to the following factors.

First, the relationship between the development of diversified economy and all aspects has been correctly resolved, especially the relationship with the state, the relationship with agricultural production, and the relationship with the lives of the commune members. Although the Hongguang Commune runs many factories and operates a wide range of sideline production, none of them are uncoordinated with the national plan. The principles of running industry and developing diversified economy are: raw materials needed by the state are not used, products that the state can fully supply are not developed, and commodities needed by the state and the market that they can produce are developed on a large scale. When we first arrived at the commune, we heard that they had a large fiber factory (more than 50 workers), and we thought that the raw materials for this factory must be needed by the state. After learning about it, we found out that it used wild plants such as rice straw and kudzu vines and tree bark that grow everywhere in the commune. Aromatic oil and the famous Shu embroidery are export goods needed by the state. They have a large amount of raw materials such as fragrant grass and camphor trees here, and many women have embroidery skills, so they vigorously engage in it. When developing industry and diversified operations, the Hongguang Commune truly grasped the principle of serving agricultural production and combining with agricultural production. Factories run by them that directly serve agricultural production account for more than 90% of the total industrial output value. At the same time, they adopt the policy of "large-scale production during the slack season, small-scale production during the slightly busy season, and no production during the busy season" and "doing agriculture on sunny days and industry and sideline occupations on rainy days." From December of last year to February of this year, it was the agricultural slack season, so they engaged in large-scale production. Nearly 4,000 people in the entire commune participated in professional teams, and they also engaged in mass movements on a large scale; after February, the agricultural busy season began, the professional teams were reduced to 2,000 people, and mass movements were no longer engaged in; the summer harvest and summer planting season is the busy season, and the industry of almost all management districts and production teams is completely stopped, so that the labor force directly participating in agricultural production reaches about 90% of the total labor force. Whether it is industry or other diversified operations, the Hongguang Commune pays great attention to serving the lives of the commune members. In this way, it not only stimulates the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members, but also promotes the faster development of diversified economy. For example, the commune is large in scale, with more than 16,000 households and more than 70,000 people. Grain processing and non-staple food production and supply are a big problem. If it is not solved well, it will not only affect the lives of the commune members, but also inevitably take more labor to run around for these things. As soon as the commune was established, it paid attention to this problem. It built four hydropower stations, 150 water mills, and also established a non-staple food processing factory and a brewing factory. The grain processing problem was solved, and the non-staple food problem was also solved. The same is true for other things such as vegetable production and the development of poultry. The commune planted 16,000 mu of vegetables this year, 4,000 mu for the commune members' own use and 12,000 mu for sale. This not only allows each commune member to eat two or three jin of fresh vegetables a day, but also allows the commune to increase its income by more than 1 million yuan.

Correct methods and appropriate measures are another important factor for the good and rapid development of the commune's diversified economy. Simply put, their practices include the following: ① The commune, management district, and production team have a clear division of labor and close cooperation. Taking industry as an example, whether it is farm tools, chemical fertilizers, or pesticide industry, it is run at all levels, but there is a division of labor at all levels. The commune runs large-scale factories with high technical requirements, followed by the management district, and then the production team. The commune is responsible for researching and trial-producing new products, and for training technical personnel for the management district and production team. The management district and production team then replicate and imitate the products that the commune has already successfully tested. At the beginning of this year, a large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement was launched. After the chemical fertilizer factory directly operated by the commune successfully trial-produced potassium magnesium fertilizer with the same fertilizer efficiency as potassium sulfate, the management district and production team immediately learned to imitate it, and sent 700 to 800 people to learn the technology. ② Small-scale production is the main thing, and local methods of production are the main thing. Of the 240 factories in the entire commune, only 12 have more than 20 people. All factories only have some foreign machines in a few factories such as the farm tool manufacturing, chemical fertilizer, and pesticide factories directly operated by the commune. The rest are local equipment. For example, most of the local chemical fertilizer factories, which account for half of the factories, are equipped with only one or two iron pots, a few thatched houses, one or two earthen stoves, a few wooden buckets, and dung pits. ③ Spend less money, see results quickly, and use local materials. All the industries here use local materials, and they all spend less money and see results quickly. For example, the raw materials for local chemical fertilizer are old wall soil and thousand-foot mud, which does not cost money and can be used as soon as it is taken. Another example is bamboo ware processing. The raw material is bamboo. There are green bamboos growing everywhere beside the houses and villages and along the banks of rivers and canals. The commune has nearly 4,000 mu of bamboo forests, and the raw materials are sufficient, so no investment is required. Since the commune developed a diversified economy in November last year, bamboo ware processing alone has brought in 480,000 yuan. ④ It is precisely because they have adopted the practices of "small-scale production as the main thing," "local methods of production," and "using local materials" that they can start up at any time and shut down at any time, be large or small as they please, and be able to advance or retreat, so that they can closely integrate with agricultural production and achieve "large-scale production during the slack season, small-scale production during the slightly busy season, and no production during the busy season" and "agriculture on sunny days, and industry and sideline occupations on rainy days."

The third reason why the diversified economy of the Hongguang Commune has developed so quickly and well is that they have better implemented the policy of combining professional teams with mass movements and combining collective management with commune members' household management in their work. Industries with more complex equipment, such as farm tool manufacturing and chemical fertilizer, are collectively run by the commune, management district, and production team; embroidery, straw shoe making, and raising chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits are suitable for private management, so commune members are mobilized to do it privately; some projects are suitable for both collective and private management, such as bamboo ware processing and vegetable production, so both parties do it. Facts have proved that wherever this practice is seriously implemented, the diversified economy develops quickly and well. For example, in the vegetable production here, on the one hand, the commune, management district, and production team have vegetable bases for collective production, and on the other hand, commune members are mobilized to "insert needles where there is space" in front of and behind their houses and in the fields. It is also decided that "whoever plants it harvests it." As a result, not only has the collective vegetable production been greatly developed, but each commune member can also earn 100 to 150 jin of raw grain and more vegetables and fruits this year.

This is the actual situation of the comprehensive economic development of the Hongguang People's Commune that we have learned about. These facts show that after communization, the production here—whether it is agricultural production or industry or diversified economy—has developed by leaps and bounds. This rate of development has never been seen before communization. Judging from the actual situation of this commune, there is every reason to believe that as the People's Commune is consolidated, improved, and perfected in organization and system, and as the experience in management and other aspects is further improved and enhanced, the commune's various production undertakings will definitely develop more rapidly.

    飞跃
    ——红光公社见闻杂记之一
    田流
    人民公社从去年9月建立以后，经过了秋收、冬季生产、春季生产和夏收，已经是“业经寒暑、一历春秋”了。究竟公社化给农村带来了怎样的影响？人民公社的生产同农业社比较起来有什么不同？人民生活发生了什么变化？等等，为了找寻这些问题的答案，我们到四川省郫县人民公社作了一次短时间的调查。下面就是我们在红光人民公社看到听到的一些实际情况。
            一个不同
    从北京出发时，我们原打算先看一下小麦的生长状况。可是6月8日到达红光人民公社时，田野已是一片碧绿，不仅小麦早已收割，连早稻和中稻的插秧工作也已结束了。“这也算是一个不同，”公社党委书记说，“往年，芒种后才开始插秧，今年刚过芒种已经栽插完毕，规格质量也有很大提高和改进。”一连几天我们到田里去看秧苗，耕了多深，施了多少底肥？我们没有看到，但从禾苗生长的状况看，
  “深耕八、九寸，底肥一百担”是完全可信的。今年，这里的水稻都比去年提高了密植的程度，而且全部是良种。去年，这里的栽植规格一般是窝距五寸、六寸，行距是八寸或是窝距行距都是七寸，每亩一万五至两万窝左右。今年，有70％的稻田密植到窝距三寸行距七寸，有10％左右的田作为试验窝距是二寸，行距是七寸，其余都是窝距四寸、行距八寸，每亩有二万到五万窝，全部稻田有70％在四万窝到五万窝之间，经过分蘖，每亩将有三十万到六十万穗。有效株数比去年增加将近一倍。我们6月底离开红光公社的时候早稻正在抽穗，中稻也已拔节、分蘖，从生长的状况看，块块秆粗叶挺，获得比去年每亩一千零二十斤更高的产量是完全可能的。
    油菜、小麦的产量如何呢？公社为了赶季节，把早稻和中稻早些栽插完毕，小麦还没有最后脱完粒，总产量和单位面积产量还没有最后计算出来。不过有一点是已经清楚了：空前大丰收。这可以从公社出售余粮的情形中看出来。去年夏季，郫县全县出售余粮的总数是小麦七百万斤。今年，红光人民公社就是七百万斤。一个社等于去年农业社时期全县出售余粮的总数，比去年本社售余粮的数字（一百七十五万斤）整整提高了三倍，没有空前的大丰收怎么可能呢！最初，我们以为只是红光公社今年生产发展得特别好，别的公社怕不是这样。后来一了解，全县情况也大体相似。郫县全县，今年夏季共售余粮（小麦）二千四百万斤，比去年的七百万斤也提高了两倍半。
    是不是卖了过头粮？出售余粮以后，公社是不是留足了来年的种子，社员是不是留下了足够的口粮？
      “够了，而且还有得多。”公社干部们这样回答。
      “就是再少留个十斤、二十斤麦子，到收稻子以前也能保证吃饱吃好。”公共食堂的工作人员这样说。
      “咋个不够啊！”社员们又这样说。
    红光公社第十二管理区的具体情况，证明上面这些说法是正确的。这个管理区明年计划种小麦二千亩（今年是一千五百七十亩），共留种八万斤，平均每亩四十斤。卖过余粮留足种子以后，每个社员还平均有小麦六十斤，另外还有荞麦二十斤，土豆二百斤（折粮五十斤），三项共计一百三十斤。8月初就要收获早稻，从6月中旬到8月初还有五十天，就是说大人小孩平均起来一天有二斤半粮食，难怪社员说：“咋个不够”了。
    油菜的情况大体上也和小麦的情况类似，甚至更好些。
            三个原因
    红光人民公社的夏收作物所以能够获得空前的大丰收，除了人民公社规模大，人力、物力雄厚，从而更能够精耕细作等等别的公社同样也有的优越条件以外，除了比过去更细致地全面贯彻了农业增产“八字宪法”以外，还有下面三个具体的原因：一是正确地贯彻了多种高产多收的方针；二是改良了灌溉系统和灌溉状况；三是土地平整和土地规划工作做得比较好。
    今年红光公社的夏季作物大丰收，主要由两个内容构成的：播种面积的扩大和单位产量的提高。其中扩大播种面积更起了主要的决定的作用。仍以十二管理区为例，从已经脱粒完毕的部分麦田看，平均亩产量大约在四百五十斤左右，比去年亩产三百七十斤提高20％上下，但是由于他们的播种面积由去年的一千一百多亩增加到一千五百七十亩，总产量将比去年增产70％左右。所以，这里的干部和群众对中央提出的：既要提高单位面积产量，又要扩大播种面积的多种高产多收方针十分拥护，决心把今年的复种指数再提高20％。郫县位于川西平原的核心地区，气候适宜，水利条件好，历年来复种指数就比较高，而且在党的提倡下年年有所发展，去年全县的复种指数已经由解放初期的175％提高到270％。红光公社更达到了300％。去年秋耕秋种时虽然由于大炼钢铁，劳动力十分紧张，仍极力地扩大了小麦的播种面积。但是今年春天却发生了另一种情况，由于对中央提出的经过长期奋斗才能实现的“少种高产多收”方针了解得不全面，有些管理区和生产队缩小了一部分播种面积。十二管理区去年双季早稻共二千四百亩，今年只九百多亩。经过上级党委的宣传、指示，特别是小麦丰收的事实的教育、启发，人们决定用扩大中、晚稻和晚秋作物面积的办法，把春季少种的损失弥补过来。决心把复种指数由去年的303％提高到320％，把水稻的栽植面积由去年占总耕面积80％提高到95％。现在，这个管理区已经栽中稻七千亩，比去年的三千四百多亩增加了一倍多，并将尽可能扩大晚稻和晚秋作物的播种面积。
    改良灌溉系统和灌溉状况是红光人民公社获得夏季大丰收的又一个重要原因。红光公社在川西平原有名的都江堰灌溉流域。全部土地几乎都能自流灌溉。照道理，“八字宪法”中“水”这一条该不会有问题了。其实不然。过去，在封建地主的控制和个体经济的影响下，灌溉沟渠配置得很不合理。解放后由于互助合作运动的开展，这种情况虽然年年都有改善，但是因为农业社规模小，只能在较小的范围内作一定程度的改良，不能从根本上加以改善，更不能充分地利用水利，让它多方面地为人们的生产、生活服务。据调查，红光公社去年刚成立的时候，在公社的土地上横七竖八地有一万多条灌溉渠道。按照实际需要有五千条就满够用了。他们从公社成立时起，就着手改变这些不合规格的渠道。这是一件很大的工程，最后完成虽然还需一段时间，可是半年以来已经获得了很大成绩。到6月中旬止，除了封闭了一些不必要的多余的沟渠以外，还在几条主要的干渠上修建了二十多座水闸，加强了人们对于水的控制能力。社员们说：“现在啥时要水啥时有，要多有多要少有少。”灌溉状况有了很大的改善，而且由于适当地减少了多余的渠道，还增加了耕地面积百十多亩。在改良渠道修建水闸的同时，公社还建立了四座发电站和一百五十多座水碾。现在不仅部分社员的家里有了电灯，全公社七万多人的食粮加工和几万头猪的饲料加工问题都由水电站、水碾解决了，还给国家加工了一千多万斤粮食，公社由此增加了十万多元的收入。
    作好土地加工，很好地平整土地；进行土地规划，实行合理种植是人人都知道的一个增产的好办法。可是在公社化以前，由于种种的条件限制，总不能很好地实现。红光公社一成立，人们就紧紧地抓住了这一点，在改造灌溉系统的同时，大力进行了土地平整连片的工作，把过去三亩五亩一块的“豆腐”田变成了四、五十亩到一百亩的大块田，从根本上改变了“平原不适宜机械耕作”的局面，有50％以上的麦田是由拖拉机深耕的。据这里历年的经验，拖拉机耕地由于耕得深，能够抢住季节，一般要比人工耕田增产20％左右。一面平整土地，一面进行土地利用规划，根据人民公社“一大二公”的特点，根据“统一领导，分级管理，分级核算”的原则，红光公社各个管理区都已作了土地规划、作物种植规划以及种子规划。今年的夏收作物就是按照这些规划种植的，这样就不仅由于“因地种植”更好地发挥了地力，提高了单位面积产量，还为将来的倒茬轮作和增进土壤肥力创造了很好的条件。虽然今年是公社施行这些规划的第一年，而且这些规划也还有不够完善不尽合理的地方，但方向是对头的，好处也是很明显的，只要坚持下去，在实践中不断修正、补充，一定会得到愈来愈显著的增产效果。
    当然，红光公社获得夏季空前大丰收的原因不止这些，譬如推广先进的耕作技术，坚强的党的领导和深入的政治思想工作等等，都是很重要的原因。这些问题我们预备单独加以介绍，这里就不多谈了。
            多种经营
    红光公社的农业生产发展得这样快，多种经济又发展得怎样呢？先看事实吧：现在公社有工业、牧业、副业等三种主要的生产事业，也有一些林业和渔业。如果分行分业计算起来，全社经营着六十多种生产事业。其中工业有农具机械制造修配工厂，土化肥、土农药工厂，采煤、石灰窑以及野生纤维和酿造工厂和粮食加工工厂等等，大大小小的工厂共有二百四十多座，其中有60％以上是公社化以后才建立起来的。林、牧、副、渔等多种经济在经营项目上虽然比公社化前增加不多，但在规模和发展速度上却不能同日而语了。从它们的总产值计算起来，至少比公社化以前增加了三倍左右。红光公社的多种经济（包括工业但不包括生猪和蔬菜生产）有一个特点：为本社农业生产服务、为社员生活服务的自给性的生产占绝大部分，按产值计算达90％以上，商品性的生产不到10％。虽然各地区的条件不同，这个比例也不应该完全一样。但从目前公社的人力、物力条件看，从当前生产力发展水平看，从公社当前的主要任务是发展农业生产看，这个比例是恰当的。就是这个不到10％的商品性的多种经济，从去年11月到今年2月，四个月时间给公社增加了四十五万元的现金收入，全社每月的工资总额是十二万元，恰恰差不多够发工资。2月以后公社实行分级管理分级核算，收入情况还没有计算上来，但从几个管理区的具体情况看，除自给外，商品性的多种经济的收入用来发工资是完全没有问题的。这里从去年11月份实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度以来，除3月份社员们自动地把工资作为生产投资，买了肥料以外，月月都发了工资。不到10％的商品性的多种经济，四个月能收入四十五万元，那么整个的多种经济的产值不是四百五十万元么！而公社化以前的1957年（去年公社化前由于大搞农业生产和基本建设，多种经济的收入要少一些）全年才收入四十三万九千多元。至于自给性的多种经济对公社农业生产和社员生活的作用那是一下子很难说完全的。仅从社办工业的一、两件事例中看，对农业生产的支援上就可略知梗概了。譬如化肥农药厂至4月底已为公社全部土地（十二万亩）每亩生产了三百斤土化肥、二十斤农药；农具厂作了很多的新式农具，去年秋耕时的绳索牵引机等等不计外，今年夏收只脱粒机就作了四十多部。这种脱粒机用水电站的电力带动或拖拉机带动，四部能顶一部康拜因机的效率。十二管理区用水碾的涡轮带动，一小时也能脱粒三百斤，而人用连耞脱粒，或用拌桶脱粒，一天才能脱粒三十多斤到五十多斤。
            几种办法
    红光人民公社的多种经济所以能够发展得这样快，主要是由于下面几个因素。
    首先是正确解决了发展多种经济同各方面的关系，特别是同国家的关系，同农业生产的关系和社员生活的关系。红光公社举办的工厂虽多，经营的各种副业生产虽广，却没有一种是同国家计划不协调的。他们办工业、发展多种经济的原则是国家需要的原料不用，国家能充分供应的产品不搞，国家和市场需要的商品而自己又能搞的大搞。我们刚到公社时，听说他们有个很大的纤维厂（五十多工人），以为这个厂的原料一定是国家需要的，一了解原来用的是稻草和本社遍地生长的葛藤、树皮等野生植物。芳香油和有名的蜀绣是国家需要的出口物资，他们这里有大量的香草、香樟树等原料，又有很多的妇女会刺绣技术，就大力搞。红光公社在发展工业和多种经营时，真正掌握了为农业生产服务与农业生产结合的原则。他们举办的工厂，直接为农业生产服务的，占工业总产值90％以上。同时在经营方针上采取“农闲大搞、小忙小搞、大忙不搞”和“晴天搞农业，雨天搞工业、副业”的方针。去年12月至今年2月是农闲，大搞。全社近四千人参加专业队，另外还大搞群众运动；2月以后开始农忙，专业队减到二千人，也不搞群众运动了；夏收夏种时是大忙时期，各管理区、生产队的工业几乎全部停止，使直接参加农业生产的劳动力达到总劳动力90％左右。无论是工业还是其他多种经营，红光公社都很注意为社员生活服务。这样，不仅激发了广大社员的积极性，也促进多种经济更快地发展了起来。如，公社规模大，有一万六千多户，七万多人口。粮米加工和副食品生产供应是个大问题，解决不好不仅影响社员生活，还势必拿出更多的劳力为这些事奔忙。公社一建立就注意了这个问题，建了四个水电站，一百五十座水碾，又办了副食品加工工厂和酿造厂，粮食加工问题解决了，副食品问题也解决了。其他如蔬菜生产、发展家禽也是如此。公社今年种一万六千亩蔬菜，四千亩社员自用，一万二千亩出售，不仅使每个社员一天能吃到二三斤鲜菜，公社还能增加一百多万元的收入。
    办法对头，措施适当是这个公社多种经济发展得又好又快的另一个重要因素。简单说来他们的作法有下面几种：①公社、管理区、生产队分工明确而又密切协作。以工业为例，无论农具、化肥或农药工业，都是级级举办但又级级分工。公社办技术要求高的规模大的，管理区次之，生产队又次之。公社负责研究试制新产品，为管理区和生产队培养训练技术力量，管理区和生产队则复制和仿造公社已经试验成功的产品。今年初大搞积肥运动，公社直接经营的化肥厂试制成功了肥效与硫酸钾相同的钾镁肥后，管理区、生产队立刻学习仿造，并派了七、八百人去学会了技术。②小型为主，土法生产为主。全社二百四十多个工厂，二十人以上的只有十二个。全部工厂仅公社直接经营的农具制造、化肥、农药等少数几个厂有点洋机器外，都是土设备。例如占工厂半数的土化肥厂，设备大都是只有一两口铁锅、几间茅草屋、一二个泥土灶，几个木桶和粪坑。③花钱少，见效快，就地取材。这里的全部工业都是就地取材，而且都花钱少见效快。如土化肥原料是老墙土、千脚泥，不用花钱，拿来就是。再如竹器加工，原料是竹子，这社屋旁村边、河渠两岸到处绿竹丛生，公社约有近四千亩竹林，原料充足，不需投资。从去年11月公社发展多种经济以来，仅竹器加工一项就收入了四十八万元。④正是由于他们采取了“小型为主”“土法生产”、“就地取材”的作法，因此，能够随时上马，随时下马，大小自如，能进能退，从而能够同农业生产密切结合，作到
  “农闲大搞，小忙小搞，大忙不搞”和“晴天农业，雨天工业、副业”。
    红光公社多种经济发展得又快又好的第三个原因，是他们在工作中较好地贯彻了专业队与群众运动相结合，集体经营与社员家庭经营相结合等两条腿走路的方针。农具制造、化肥等工业的设备比较复杂就由公社、管理区、生产队集体搞；刺绣、打草鞋、养鸡鸭鹅兔等适合私人经营，就发动社员私人搞；有些项目既适合集体搞，也适合私人搞，如竹器加工、蔬菜生产等，就双方都搞。事实证明，凡是认真贯彻了这种作法的，多种经济都发展得又快又好，如这里的蔬菜生产，一方面公社、管理区、生产队有蔬菜基地，进行集体生产，同时又发动社员在房前屋后田头地角“见缝插针”，而且决定“谁种谁收”，这样作的结果，不仅集体的蔬菜生产有了很大发展，每个社员今年还可以收入一百斤到一百五十斤原粮和更多的蔬菜瓜果。
    这就是我们了解的红光人民公社经济全面发展的实际情况。这些事实说明：公社化以后，这里的生产——无论是农业生产还是工业或多种经济，都有了飞跃的发展。这样的发展速度，在公社化以前是从来没有过的。从这个公社的实际情况看，完全有理由相信，随着人民公社在组织上、制度上的巩固、提高和健全，随着经营管理等各方面经验的进一步完善和提高，公社的各项生产事业一定会更加迅速发展的。
