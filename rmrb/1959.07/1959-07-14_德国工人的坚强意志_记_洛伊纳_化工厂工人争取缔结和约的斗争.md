    The Strong Will of German Workers
    ——On the Struggle of Workers at the "Leuna" Chemical Plant to Achieve a Peace Treaty
    Yang Yuan
    At the entrance of the "Leuna" chemical factory, blooming with roses, hangs a striking red banner with the large characters – “We, the ‘Leuna’ Workers, Demand a Peace Treaty.” Inside the factory, whether in the workshops, factory buildings, canteens, or clubs, one can see slogans written by workers everywhere demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and defending peace. For the past half-year, the workers of the "Leuna" chemical factory, like all workers in the German Democratic Republic, have once again thrown themselves into a new battle to achieve a peace treaty.

    "Leuna" is the largest chemical factory in the German Democratic Republic. Since its construction in 1916, it has gone through the years of two world wars. Kaiser Wilhelm and Hitler both used it to serve the war, and German monopoly capitalists extracted huge profits from this factory. After the First World War, the November Revolution broke out in Germany, and the working class demanded liberation from the enslavement of militarism and imperialism. In 1921, the "Leuna" workers also participated in the famous March Action in central Germany. The revolution was not successful, the capitalists remained in power, and the workers were suppressed. Near the end of the Second World War, American planes dropped 80,000 bombs on this factory, causing extremely serious damage to "Leuna." Only after the collapse of the fascist regime did this factory receive new life. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union, the workers of "Leuna" overcame countless difficulties and gradually rebuilt the factory from the ruins. Now, "Leuna" belongs to the people of the German Democratic Republic, and the workers have become the masters of the factory. An old worker who has worked in this factory for 41 years happily said: "The faces of worry and hunger that were seen in the factory for many years can no longer be seen." The "Leuna" workers now proudly supply hundreds of products at home and abroad, and 90% of the nitrogen fertilizer needed by the German Democratic Republic is produced by the workers here. Speaking of these things, the "Leuna" workers said: "We will never forget the disasters brought about by militarism, and we will never allow others to take away the fruits of our labor!"

    The revolutionary tradition and tortuous experiences of the "Leuna" factory have made the "Leuna" workers show their determination and strength in the struggle for a peace treaty and the defense of peace.

    At the beginning of this year, after the Soviet government proposed a draft peace treaty with Germany, the workers of the "Leuna" factory thoroughly discussed this draft treaty and held meetings to express their support. They also sent a delegation to one of the largest chemical companies in West Germany to promote the content of the Soviet proposals to the worker brothers there and exchange opinions on the struggle to achieve a peace treaty.

    Since the opening of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, the progress of the conference has become a central topic of discussion at various meetings of the factory party organization, the trade union, and workers' residential areas. On May 11, the day the Foreign Ministers' Conference opened, 10,000 workers gathered at the factory to express their support for the position of their government delegation. In a letter signed by all employees, they demanded the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the transformation of West Berlin into a demilitarized free city. Adenauer and Brentano's stubborn stance and behavior of betraying national interests became the object of condemnation by the workers. They said that Adenauer doesn't want a peace treaty; with a peace treaty, his militarist and revanchist policies would be finished! The workers also put up large cartoons ridiculing Brentano at the main intersections in the factory. When the notorious "package plan" reached the factory, the workers were extremely angry. The workers said that any plan to annex the German Democratic Republic and march eastward must and can be stopped by us! During the Foreign Ministers' Conference and its recess, many workers in the factory wrote letters to their West German worker brothers to explain the German Democratic Republic's peaceful policy and expose Adenauer's deceptive propaganda.

    The struggle of the "Leuna" workers for a peace treaty not only demonstrated the upsurge of political enthusiasm, but the workers also deeply knew that completing the main economic tasks put forward by the Party and the state was a major part of the struggle to achieve a peace treaty. The workers said, "We must strengthen the strength of our worker-peasant state with production achievements," "The stronger our country is, the better our lives will be, and the smaller the hope that the Bonn warmongers will realize their war plans." These ideas have become the actual actions of the "Leuna" workers. Recently, a vigorous production upsurge has been set off throughout the factory. In the first quarter of this year, the factory overfulfilled the production plan with a score of 101.3%; the production plan for April was completed at 104.2%, an increase of 13.3% over the same period last year.

    In the past two months, the "Leuna" workers have been discussing the factory's seven-year perspective plan. 22,000 of the factory's 30,000 employees participated in the discussion. Inspired by the acceleration of construction and the strengthening of national power, the workers have offered suggestions and ideas. Over the past few months, the workers have put forward thousands of rationalization proposals. After detailed discussions, the workers decided that the entire factory would increase production by 12 million marks more than the state-stipulated target this year, and by 1965, the total output value would increase by another 322.2 million marks compared to the state's original plan, while saving the state an investment of 187 million marks.

    The number of participants in the production competition has also increased. More than 17,300 people in the factory participated in the socialist labor competition, 81 production teams participated in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," and 75 socialist work and research collectives, including engineers, technicians, and workers, have been organized. At present, all production workshops in the factory have set specific targets and are engaged in a campaign to complete 80% of the annual production plan by the 10th anniversary of the National Day. In this campaign, the workers used rockets as a symbol of accelerating the speed of construction.

    One hand strikes hard at West German militarism fostered by U.S. imperialism, and the other hand firmly grasps production and construction – this is the glorious and arduous struggle that the working class of the German Democratic Republic is currently engaged in. The "Leuna" workers, like millions of working people in the German Democratic Republic, are twisting political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm into one rope, and using their labor achievements to enhance the strength and prestige of the first worker-peasant state in German history – the German Democratic Republic.

    德国工人的坚强意志
    ——记“洛伊纳”化工厂工人争取缔结和约的斗争
    杨原
    在盛开着玫瑰花的“洛伊纳”化学工厂门口，悬挂着一幅醒目的红色大字标语——“我们‘洛伊纳’工人要求和约”。走进工厂，无论是在车间、厂房、食堂或是俱乐部里，到处都能看到工人们写的要求缔结对德和约和保卫和平的各种各样的标语。半年以来，“洛伊纳”化学工厂的工人和德意志民主共和国所有工人一样，再一次投入争取缔结和约的新的战斗。
    “洛伊纳”是德意志民主共和国最大的化学工厂。自从1916年建厂以来，它经过了两次世界大战的年代。威廉皇帝和希特勒都曾利用它为战争服务，德国大垄断资本家在这个工厂榨取过大量利润。第一次世界大战以后，在德国爆发了十一月革命，工人阶级要求从军国主义和帝国主义奴役下解放出来。“洛伊纳”工人在1921年也曾投入在德国中部发生的闻名的3月战斗。革命没有成功，资本家仍然当政，工人受到了镇压。第二次世界大战快要结束的时候，美国飞机向这个工厂投了八万枚炸弹，“洛伊纳”遭到了极其严重的破坏。只是在法西斯政权垮台之后，这个工厂才得到新生。在德国统一社会党的领导下，在苏联的大力帮助下，“洛伊纳”的工人克服了无数困难，逐步地把工厂从废墟上重建起来。现在，“洛伊纳”属于德意志民主共和国全民所有，工人成了工厂的主人。在这个工厂工作了四十一年的一个老工人高兴地说：“多少年来忧愁和饥饿的面孔在工厂中再也看不到了。”“洛伊纳”工人现在骄傲地把几百种产品供应国内外，德意志民主共和国全国所需的氮肥90％是这里工人制造的。谈起这些事，“洛伊纳”工人说：“我们永远不会忘记军国主义带来的灾难，我们决不允许别人夺走我们的劳动成果！”
    “洛伊纳”工厂所具有的革命传统和曲折经历，使得“洛伊纳”的工人在争取和约、保卫和平的斗争中表现出他们的决心和力量。
    今年年初，苏联政府提出对德和约草案以后，“洛伊纳”工厂的工人们就深入地讨论了这个和约草案，并且集会表示拥护。他们还派了代表团到西德一家最大的化学公司去，向那里的工人弟兄宣传苏联建议的内容，交换争取缔结和约斗争的意见。
    日内瓦外长会议开幕以来，会议的进程成为工厂党组织、工会、工人住宅区的各种集会上经常讨论的中心题目。5月11日，外长会议开幕那一天，工厂里就曾有一万工人集会，表示支持自己的政府代表团的立场。在一封由全体职工签名的写给外长们的信中，要求迅速缔结对德和约和把西柏林转变为非军事化自由城市。阿登纳、勃伦塔诺的顽固立场和出卖民族利益的行为，成为工人们谴责的对象。他们说，阿登纳不要和约，有了和约，他的军国主义和复仇主义政策就完蛋了！工人们还在工厂里的主要路口放着嘲笑勃伦塔诺的大幅漫画。当臭名远扬的“一揽子计划”传到工厂里以后，工人们都愤怒极了。工人们说，任何吞并德意志民主共和国、向东方进军的计划，我们都必需而且能够加以制止！在外长会议进行和休会期间，厂里许多工人纷纷给西德工人兄弟写信，向他们讲解德意志民主共和国的和平政策，揭露阿登纳的欺骗宣传。
    “洛伊纳”工人争取和约的斗争不只表现了政治热情的高涨，而且工人们也深深地知道，完成党和国家提出的主要经济任务是争取缔结和约斗争的一个主要内容。工人们说，“要用生产成就加强我们工农国家的力量”，“我们国家越强大，我们的生活越过得好，波恩战争贩子想实现他们的战争计划的希望也就越小。”这些思想已经成为“洛伊纳”工人的实际行动。最近一个时期，全厂掀起了蓬蓬勃勃的生产热潮。今年第一季度全厂以101.3％的成绩超额完成了生产计划；4月份的生产计划又完成了104.2％比去年同期增长了13.3％。
    近两个月来，“洛伊纳”的工人正在讨论工厂的七年远景计划。全厂三万职工有两万二千人参加了讨论。在加快建设速度、增强国家力量的鼓舞下，工人们献策献计，几个月来，工人们提出成千条合理化建议。工人们经过详细讨论以后，决定全厂今年就要比国家规定的指标增产一千二百万马克，到1965年生产总值要比国家原定计划再增加三亿二千二百万马克，同时要为国家节约投资一亿八千七百万马克。
    参加生产竞赛的人也增多了。全厂有一万七千三百多人参加社会主义劳动竞赛，八十一个生产队参加了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛，包括工程师、技术人员和工人的社会主义工作和研究集体已经组织起七十五个。目前，全厂所有生产车间都订出了具体指标，投入争取在国庆十周年时完成全年生产计划80％的运动中去。在这个运动中，工人用火箭作为加速建设速度的象征。
    一只手狠狠打击在美帝国主义扶植下的西德军国主义，一只手抓紧生产建设——这就是当前德意志民主共和国的工人阶级正在进行的光荣而艰巨的斗争。“洛伊纳”工人和德意志民主共和国千万劳动人民一样，把政治热情和生产热情拧成一根绳，用自己的劳动成就来增强德国历史上第一个工农国家——德意志民主共和国的力量和威望。
