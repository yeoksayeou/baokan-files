Silk City
By our reporters Li Xinmin and Zheng Zhibiao

　　West Lake – Silk
　　Living in Hangzhou, one sees the beautiful West Lake every day. The golden lake surface shimmering in the sunlight, the green Bai and Su causeways, and the various buildings built along the lake all evoke a sense of scenic beauty.

　　Leaving West Lake, crossing the city center, and heading east or north, one can hear the sound of weaving machines from the silk factories. When we visited these factories, the colorful and dazzling silks reminded us of West Lake.

　　The great Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi wrote about Qiantang Lake: "A riot of flowers is almost too much for the eye, and shallow grass can barely cover the horse's hooves." This natural scene of spring in Jiangnan often appears on silk weaving machines. There is a type of silk called "burnt-out" (烂花) georgette velvet. At first glance, the gauze-like silk base, set off by velvet flowers, resembles flower clusters and shallow grass floating on the water surface in spring.

　　Hangzhou is a city of scenery, and also a city of silk.

　　Every day, Hangzhou receives guests from all over the country or from abroad who come to buy silk, and every day, it receives letters praising silk.

　　Once, a group of guests from Xinjiang came to a silk store. When the salesperson placed a piece of silk with a golden glow in front of the guests, one of them immediately put it into his pocket, stretched out his hands, and began to sing and dance by the counter. After the dance, he bought it back with great joy.

　　The March of Progress
　　In recent years, Hangzhou's silk industry has developed rapidly. Now, Hangzhou has more than 30 factories for silk reeling, silk weaving, printing and dyeing, and machine repair, forming a complete silk industry system. China's first modern silk printing and dyeing complex has also been put into production. Many basic construction projects are still underway.

　　In these factories, there are hundreds of technical innovations every year. We visited the silk weaving workshop of the Hangzhou Silk Factory (which was pieced together from several broken factories). Here, the machines are of various types and seem quite old, but they produce high-quality silk. There are at least two to four equipment reforms on each machine, and there are several innovations just for the shuttle. Some machines are equipped with a small steel awl-like "weft detector" that uses electricity to automatically stop the shuttle when the silk runs out. Some shuttles automatically replace the empty shuttle with another shuttle with silk when the silk runs out, without stopping the machine at all.

　　A Garden Full of Spring
　　Hangzhou's more than 10,000 silk workers have produced white filature silk and silk fabrics in the past decade, the value of which is equivalent to laying 112 railway tracks from Shanghai to Hangzhou. The silk fabrics produced alone could circle the equator four times. Last year, they produced more than 200 new varieties and more than 2,000 new patterns. This year, in the first four months, they produced more than 140 new varieties and more than 1,200 new patterns.

　　New varieties such as "East Wind" silk, "Pearl Shadow" silk, "Golden Star" satin, "Sky Glow" satin, and "New Elegant" brocade have been highly praised by people at home and abroad.

　　Eight silk factories, including Dujinsheng and Yunshang, are producing 19 kinds of decorative silks for curtains, screens, sofas, and other applications for buildings in the capital. Some are shimmering with gold, and some are antique, fully demonstrating the unique style of Chinese silk. Among them, the "East Wind" satin is 18 feet wide, and its loom is 23 feet wide.

　　The Designer's Ingenuity
　　The creation of a new pattern variety goes through many procedures. The first procedure is pattern design.

　　What patterns and colors do people like the most? This is a question that designers consider every day. These people's time is not only spent at their desks, but also in parks, in the fields, on construction sites, and on the streets. They pay attention to every new style and color, pay attention to pedestrians' clothes and hair, and even the things they hold in their hands.

　　We visited Ma Zugen, a designer at the Victory Silk Sample Factory. This silver-haired old man has 35 years of silk production experience. Recently, he created a "Blue Star Silk" based on a pattern on a female comrade's handbag. He said: If girls make it into clothes, this clothes will shine with golden light, like the stars in the sky.

　　The currently most popular "East Wind" silk was designed by him. This printed, woven, and carved silk looks like flowers within flowers, with distinct layers and bright and novel colors. He collected many samples in order to design this new pattern, but to no avail. One morning, he went to visit the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station. On the train, he discovered a green wheat field outside the window. Farmers began to work in the fields, and a red sun rose above the mountain, shining brightly. He was completely occupied by this magnificent natural scene, and the pattern he had been struggling with for many days and nights was found at this moment.

    丝绸城

      西湖——丝绸
    住在杭州，天天看到绮丽多姿的西湖。阳光下闪着金光的湖面，绿色的白堤和苏堤，沿湖兴筑的各种各样的建筑物，处处使人感到景物之美。
    离开西湖，穿过市区，向东走或者向北走，人们可以听到丝绸厂里发出的一片机梭声。当我们访问这些工厂时，五彩缤纷，光耀夺目的绸缎，使人想起了西湖。
    唐代大诗人白居易咏钱塘湖的诗写道：“乱花渐欲迷人眼，浅草才能没马蹄”。这种江南春天的自然景象，经常出现在织绸机上。有一种绸子叫烂花乔其丝绒，乍看起来，轻纱似的绸底，衬托着朵朵绒花，就像春天里漂浮在水面上的花丛和浅草。
    杭州，是风景城，也是丝绸城。
    杭州每天都有从祖国各地或从国外前来购买绸缎的客人，每天都收到赞扬绸缎的信。
    有一次，一家绸缎商店进来了一群新疆来的客人。当服务员把一段放射着金黄色光亮的绸子放在客人面前时，一个客人马上把它装进自己的口袋，伸开两手，在柜台边载歌载舞起来。舞罢，带着极大的喜悦把它买了回去。
      前进的脚步
    这几年杭州丝绸工业发展很快。现在，杭州共有缫丝、织绸、印染、机器修造等工厂三十多家，构成了完整的丝绸工业系统。我国第一座现代化的丝绸印染联合厂也已经投入生产。许多基本建设工程还正在进行。
    在这些工厂中，技术革新每年有好几百项。我们访问了杭州丝绸厂（这是由几个破厂子拼起来的）的织绸车间。这里，机器是各式各样的，看来已经相当老了，可是它们却生产出质量很好的绸子。这里每部机子上至少有两项到四项设备上的改革，单是梭子就有好几样革新。有的机子装上一件小钢钎一样的“探纬”，利用电力能使梭子在丝用完时自动停下来。有的梭子，丝用完时，就自动地换上另一只有丝的梭子，根本不要停车。
        春色满园
    杭州一万多丝绸工人，近十年来，他们生产的白厂丝和绸缎，价值相当于铺设一百一十二条从上海到杭州的铁路钢轨的价值，单是生产的绸缎就可以绕地球赤道四转。去年，他们生产了二百多个新品种和二千多个新花色。今年，头四个月他们又生产了一百四十多个新品种和一千二百多个新花色。
    东风绸、珠影绸、金星光缎、天霞缎、新雅锦等新品种，都受到了国内国外人们的极大赞赏。
    都锦生、云裳等八个丝绸厂正为首都的建筑物生产着窗帘、屏风、沙发等应用的十九种装饰绸缎，有的金光闪耀，有的古色古香，充分显示了我国绸缎的独特风格。其中“东风缎”有十八市尺阔，它的织机宽二十三市尺。
    设计者的巧思
    一个新的花色品种的产生，要经过许多道手续。第一道手续是图案设计。
    什么图案，什么颜色人们最喜欢？这是设计员每天考虑的问题。这些人的时间，不仅用在办公桌上，也用在公园里、野外、工地上和街头。他们注意每个新的式样和颜色，注意行人的衣服和头发，甚至手里拿的东西。
    我们访问了胜利丝绸试样厂设计员马祖根。这个满头银发的老人，已有三十五年丝绸生产经验。最近，他根据一个女同志的手提包上的花样创造了一种“兰星绸”，他说：姑娘们把它作成衣裳，这衣裳就会金光四射，像天上的繁星一样。
    当前最受欢迎的“东风绸”就是他设计的。这种印花、织花和挖花的绸子，看起来，花中有花，层次分明，色泽鲜艳新颖。他为了设计这个新图案，搜集了多少样本也无结果。有一个早上，他到新安江水电站去参观，在火车上，发现窗外一片碧绿的麦田，农民开始在田间忙碌，一轮红日升上山头，光芒万丈。他完全被这幅自然的宏伟图景所占据，苦思多少白天黑夜的图案，就在这时找到了。
