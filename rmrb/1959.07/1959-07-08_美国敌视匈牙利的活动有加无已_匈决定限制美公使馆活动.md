Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 6th. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, today handed a note to the U.S. Legation in Budapest. The note regrettably pointed out that, despite repeated proposals by the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government aimed at normalizing relations between Hungary and the United States, the U.S. government has shown no desire to improve these relations.

The note pointed out that recently, the U.S. government has not only continued but also intensified its activities against the People's Republic of Hungary in many international organizations. Many staff members of the U.S. Legation in Budapest have not ceased their subversive activities against the People's Republic of Hungary. U.S. secret agencies are sending new spies to Hungary. Recently, certain staff members of the legation have intensified illegal activities in Budapest and elsewhere that are incompatible with diplomatic practice, activities aimed at collecting intelligence and opposing Hungary's existing state system.

The note said that based on past experience, it cannot be expected that the U.S. government will take measures to stop hostile acts against Hungary. Therefore, in order to defend Hungary's state system and the Hungarian people, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government is compelled to partially restrict the movement of U.S. Legation staff in Budapest within Hungarian territory.

The note also emphasized that as long as the U.S. government takes measures to normalize mutual relations, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government is prepared to lift the aforementioned restrictions.

    美国敌视匈牙利的活动有加无已
    匈决定限制美公使馆活动
    新华社布达佩斯6日电　匈牙利外交部今天受匈牙利人民共和国工农革命政府的委托，把一份照会交给美国驻布达佩斯公使馆。照会遗憾地指出，尽管匈牙利工农革命政府不只一次地提出了目的在于使匈牙利和美国关系正常化的建议，但是，美国政府丝毫没有表现出要改善这种关系的愿望。
    照会指出，近来，美国政府不仅继续、而且在许多国际组织中加紧了反对匈牙利人民共和国的活动。美国驻布达佩斯公使馆的许多工作人员并没有停止对匈牙利人民共和国的颠覆活动。美国秘密机关把新的间谍派往匈牙利。最近，公使馆的某些工作人员在布达佩斯和外地加紧了与外交惯例不相容的非法活动，这种活动的目的在于搜集情报，反对匈牙利现存的国家制度。
    照会说，根据以往经验，不能期望美国政府采取措施来制止敌视匈牙利的行为，因此，匈牙利工农革命政府为了保卫匈牙利的国家制度和匈牙利人民，不得不局部限制美国驻布达佩斯公使馆工作人员在匈牙利境内的行动。
    照会同时强调指出，只要美国政府采取措施使相互关系正常化，则匈牙利工农革命政府准备取消上述限制。
