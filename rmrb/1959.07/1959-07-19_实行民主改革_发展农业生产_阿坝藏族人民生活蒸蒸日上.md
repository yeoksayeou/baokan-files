    Implementing Democratic Reform and Developing Agricultural Production
    Aba Tibetan People's Lives are Flourishing

    (Reported by our newspaper) After completely eliminating the oppression and exploitation of the feudal serf system, the economic life of the people of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province is flourishing with the development of various construction undertakings.
    For centuries, the people of all ethnic groups in the Aba Autonomous Prefecture groaned under the dark feudal serf system. The level of production was very low. Before liberation, the average peasant household in the prefecture lacked three to six months of food grain, and in some areas, it was more than eight months. The vast number of poor farmers and herdsmen had to rely on wild vegetables and bran to fill their stomachs; a tattered old sheepskin coat was the only clothing to get through the harsh winter, and some even passed it down for two or three generations. After liberation, in order to help people of all ethnic groups solve their difficulties in life and production, the Party and the People's Government successively issued agricultural loans of more than 3.47 million yuan, as well as 1.58 million yuan in relief funds, a large amount of relief grain, and new agricultural tools and pesticides. At the same time, various measures were taken to lead the people of all ethnic groups to reform the extensive planting and low yield, slash-and-burn cultivation methods, and vigorously develop production. In 1956, the whole prefecture implemented democratic reform, and then launched a mutual aid and cooperation movement, enabling the vast number of peasants to embark on the socialist road to common prosperity. Before liberation, the total grain output of the autonomous prefecture was only more than 110 million jin. Last year, the total grain output of the prefecture increased to more than 300 million jin. Calculated on the basis of the agricultural population, the average person had 973 jin of grain, achieving self-sufficiency with a surplus. Jisi Township in Xiaojin County has a total of five villages. Before liberation, the Tibetan people living here mostly lived on wild vegetables such as garden roots, grass seeds, and pickled vegetables, and used saltpeter instead of edible salt. Now, this kind of life is long gone. Last year, the township's grain production increased greatly, and every household deposited money in the bank, living a relatively prosperous life.
    The development of transportation and national trade has also shown a huge role in improving people's lives. In the past, there was not a single highway here, and transportation was extremely difficult. People of all ethnic groups living in the mountain villages often could not get oil, salt, tea, or cloth, and were also exploited by speculators. Now, all twelve counties in the prefecture, except for Xiaojin and Rangtang, are connected by highways, and state-owned trade and marketing organizations are spread throughout the prefecture's townships and communities.
    With the improvement of transportation conditions and the reduction of commodity circulation costs, the sales prices of various industrial products and daily necessities have continued to decline over the years, while the purchase prices of agricultural, animal husbandry, and local specialty products have continued to increase. In 1956 alone, the decline in the sales prices of four commodities, including vegetable oil and industrial products, and the increase in the purchase prices of local specialty products increased the income of the people of the prefecture by 2.5 million yuan, which could buy more than 16 million jin of highland barley.
    Now, people of all ethnic groups in the Aba Autonomous Prefecture have almost every household added new clothes and quilts; leather shoes, washbasins, flashlights and other supplies. Their purchasing power is rising year by year. According to statistics, in 1958, the average purchasing power of the people of the prefecture reached more than 91 yuan, an increase of nearly 16 yuan compared with 1955 before the democratic reform, and nearly doubled compared with 1952. The total retail sales of commodities by commercial institutions in the prefecture have also jumped from 130,000 yuan in 1950 to more than 24.4 million yuan last year, an increase of more than 180 times.
    The people of all ethnic groups in the Aba Autonomous Prefecture, who are already well-fed and clothed, have launched a high tide of improving land, treading through snow to open mountains and breaking ice to blast rocks, in order to achieve a greater harvest this year. They are actively implementing various advanced yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing, fertilization, and row planting with close spacing, striving for a bumper harvest of grain in the whole prefecture this year.

    实行民主改革　发展农业生产
    阿坝藏族人民生活蒸蒸日上
    本报讯　在彻底消灭封建农奴制度的压迫剥削后，四川省阿坝藏族自治州人民的经济生活，正随着各项建设事业的发展而蒸蒸日上。
    阿坝自治州各族人民，千百年来呻吟在黑暗的封建农奴制度下，生产水平十分低下，解放前，全州农民平均每户缺少三至六个月的口粮，有些地区则在八个月以上。广大贫苦农牧民只有靠野菜、糠皮充饥；一件破烂的老羊皮袄，就是度过严冬的唯一衣服，有的甚至传用两、三代。解放后，为了帮助各族人民解决生活、生产上的困难，党和人民政府曾先后发放农贷三百四十七万多元，并发放了一百五十八万元救济款、许多救济粮以及新式农具和农药械。同时，并采取各种措施，领导各族人民改革广种薄收，刀耕火种的耕作方法，大力发展生产。1956年，全州农村实行了民主改革，随着又开展互助合作运动，使广大农民走上共同富裕的社会主义大道。解放前，自治州粮食总产量只有一亿一千多万斤，去年，全州粮食总产量已增加到三亿多斤，以农业人口计，平均每人有粮九百七十三斤，达到自给还有积余。小金县吉斯乡共有五个村子，居住在这里的藏族人民，解放前大都靠园根、草子、酸菜等野菜度日，用硝土代替食盐。现在，这种生活早已一去不复返。去年，全乡粮食大增加，每户人家都在银行存了款，过着比较富裕的生活了。
    交通运输事业和民族贸易工作的发展，在改善人民生活上也显示了巨大的作用。过去，这里没有一条公路，交通万分困难，居住在沟寨里的各族人民，往往吃不上油、盐和茶，穿不上布，还受到投机商人的剥削。现在，全州十二个县，除小金、壤塘外，县县有公路相通，国营贸易供销机构也遍布州内各乡、社。
    随着交通条件改善和商品流转费用的降低，历年来，各种工业品和日用品销售价格不断下降，农牧业和土特产品收购价格却不断提高。仅1956年菜油、工业品等四项商品销售价格下降和土特产品收购价格的提高，就使全州人民增加了二百五十万元的收入，可以购买青稞一千六百万斤以上。
    现在，阿坝自治州人民几乎户户添制了新衣、新被；皮鞋、面盆、电筒等用品。他们的购买力年年上升。据统计，1958年全州人民的平均购买力已达九十一元以上，比民主改革前的1955年增加近十六元，比1952年增加近两倍。全州商业机构商品零售总值，也从1950年的十三万元跃升至去年的二千四百多万元，激增一百八十多倍。
    已经丰衣足食的阿坝自治州各族人民，为了取得今年更大的丰收，全州农民踏雪开山，破冰炸石，掀起了改良土地的高潮。他们积极贯彻深耕、施肥、条播密植等各种先进的增产措施，力争今年全州粮食获得大丰收。　（周祖佑）（附图片）
