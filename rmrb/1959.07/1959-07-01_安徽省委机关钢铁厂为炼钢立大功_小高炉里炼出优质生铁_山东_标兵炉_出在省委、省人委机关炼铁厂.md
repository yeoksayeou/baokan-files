    Anhui Provincial Party Committee Organ Steel Plant Makes Great Contributions to Steelmaking
    High-Quality Pig Iron Smelted in Small Blast Furnaces
    Shandong's "Pacesetter Furnace" is Located in the Iron Smelting Plant of the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee

    (Our newspaper, Hefei, 30th) The Anhui Provincial Party Committee Organ Steel Plant recently smelted high-quality pig iron using small blast furnaces, which can be used in basic converters to produce good steel. According to the results of 128 experiments conducted by Small Blast Furnace No. 17 from June 6th to 19th: 85 tests, accounting for 66.41% of the total, met the requirements for Grade One basic converter steelmaking pig iron from small blast furnaces in terms of sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus content; the average silicon content of the pig iron was 1% to 2%, and the sulfur content was consistently below 0.1%, approaching the quality level of pig iron from large modern blast furnaces.
    Smelting high-quality pig iron is of great significance for improving the quality and output of steel. However, for a long time, some people have believed: "Small blast furnaces lack precise instruments, have poor equipment, have small heat storage capacity, and cannot increase blast temperature at any time, making it impossible to smelt high-quality steelmaking pig iron." The success of the Provincial Party Committee Organ Steel Plant shattered this erroneous assertion and opened up a path for small indigenous blast furnaces to smelt high-quality pig iron.
    Under the direction of the Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Party Committee Organ Steel Plant has always attached great importance to the quality of pig iron. However, in the past, attention was only paid to desulfurization, with a target of 0.2% sulfur content, and insufficient attention was paid to further reducing the content of sulfur, silicon, phosphorus, etc. Due to the high silicon content in the pig iron, the steelmaking time was long, and the blowing loss rate was high. In order to meet the needs of steelmaking, the plant, with the assistance and guidance of the State Scientific and Technological Commission and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry working group, and based on the quality indicators for high-quality basic converter steelmaking pig iron proposed by the Hefei Iron and Steel Plant (sulfur content below 0.2%, with Grade One products with sulfur content below 0.1% accounting for more than 50%; silicon content 1% to 2%; phosphorus content 0.3% to 0.5%; manganese content 0.5%; carbon content not less than 3%), began smelting trials on May 29th.
    Scientific practice has proven that phosphorus and manganese in pig iron are relatively easy to control, mainly depending on the batching, while controlling the content of sulfur and silicon is more difficult. Therefore, at the beginning of the experiment, there was great ideological resistance. The plant's Party Committee, on the one hand, carried out in-depth and meticulous ideological education work among the workers, and at the same time strengthened technical management, raw material management, and chemical analysis work from the organizational aspect. In terms of technical management, after hard work, they explored a set of relatively scientific technical operating procedures for smelting high-quality steelmaking pig iron in small blast furnaces: fixing the charge batch, adjusting the coke ratio to make the furnace charge distribution even; regularly inspecting the furnace top equipment and correcting the center line of the charging bell in time to achieve reasonable charging; promoting high temperature and high blast volume, stabilizing the blast system, setting the blast temperature at 600 to 620 degrees and the blast pressure at 230 to 250 millimeters of mercury column; stabilizing the slag-making system to ensure good slag-making and improve the slag basicity; fully utilizing coal gas, increasing the coke load, and reducing the coke ratio; unifying operations across three shifts and strictly implementing the shift handover system. In the smelting process, they paid special attention to desulfurization and reducing silicon content by increasing the hearth temperature and slag basicity to reduce sulfur content; by improving technical operating levels and maintaining normal furnace temperature, silicon content was greatly reduced. Practice has proven that sulfur in pig iron is mainly removed in the hearth, and silicon is reduced in the belly section above the tuyeres. As long as a normal furnace temperature is maintained, desulfurization and reduction of silicon content can be carried out simultaneously, and contradictions can be unified.
    In strengthening raw material management, classified stacking and graded charging were implemented, and the crushing particle size of the ore was strictly controlled to ensure careful work with coarse materials, allowing the blast furnace to "eat well."
    In strengthening chemical analysis work, the past practice of chemical analysis reports only being seen by leaders was changed, and chemical analysis reports were directly shared with the masses. The analysis results were announced to the masses in a timely manner through broadcasting, which effectively promoted the improvement of pig iron quality.
    Encouraged by the battle cries of "Small indigenous furnaces competing with large modern furnaces" and "Thoroughly breaking through the four barriers (quality, output, coke ratio, cost), quality first, dedicating gifts to July 1st," the workers of the Provincial Party Committee Organ Steel Plant, through hard work and ingenuity, have now successfully smelted high-quality steelmaking pig iron in five small blast furnaces and maintained normal output. Among them, Small Blast Furnace No. 17 with a volume of 13 cubic meters has consistently maintained a daily output of more than ten tons (with the highest ore grade being only 45%), achieving high quality and high output.

    (Xinhua News Agency) The Iron Smelting Experimental Plant of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee has maintained a consistent and vigorous movement for high quality and high output since the beginning of this year, achieving significant results. The average utilization coefficient of the blast furnaces from January to May reached 1.29, the average qualification rate of pig iron was above 93%, and the five-month pig iron production plan was also overfulfilled.
    Since the start-up of the plant's four small blast furnaces, production has basically remained normal, and daily output has exceeded the design level. Therefore, it has been repeatedly rated as a "Red Flag Furnace," "Pacesetter Furnace," and "Long-Life Furnace" by the province and city.
    The reason why this plant has consistently produced relatively well is that provincial and municipal leaders frequently provide on-site guidance, and the plant's Party Committee has adopted a leadership method that focuses on practical results based on ideological guidance. Leading cadres pay attention to the ideological dynamics of the masses at all times, provide timely education, and ensure that workers maintain full enthusiasm for labor. Leading cadres also frequently go deep into the workshops, participate in physical labor, and focus on key points, critical aspects, and weak links.
    In organizing normal production, they have adopted various effective measures. They attach great importance to raw material preparation. After the raw materials arrive at the plant, they are stored separately according to the mining area and crushed before being charged into the furnace after the components are understood through chemical analysis. In order to allow the blast furnace to "eat its fill, eat finely, and eat well," the plant stipulates a four-no-charging system: not charging if it is not dry, not charging if it is not thoroughly screened, not charging if the particle size is uneven, and not charging if the composition is unknown. In order to ensure smooth furnace operation, they implemented a "three-diligence" (diligent inspection, diligent analysis and research, and diligent adjustment when the furnace condition is abnormal) operating method in accordance with the spirit of "prevention is better than cure." They have also stipulated strict blast furnace equipment maintenance and repair systems, as well as shift handover systems.
    This plant attaches great importance to pig iron quality and has adopted comprehensive desulfurization measures of "setting up barriers everywhere and desulfurizing at every barrier." The pig iron qualification rate has been maintained above 90% for a long time, sometimes reaching 100%.

    (Xinhua News Agency) The metallurgical cadre on-site training class held by the Shandong Provincial Metallurgical Industry Bureau in Jinan opened on June 23.
    The members of the training class will focus on observing the actual production situation of the Iron Smelting Experimental Plant of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee through on-site visits and exchanges of experience.
    At the opening ceremony, Deng Chenxi, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and Deputy Governor, encouraged the members of the training class to take this training seriously and make the production level of their units match the Iron Smelting Experimental Plant of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee.

    安徽省委机关钢铁厂为炼钢立大功
    小高炉里炼出优质生铁
    山东“标兵炉”出在省委、省人委机关炼铁厂
    本报合肥30日电　中共安徽省委机关钢铁厂最近用小高炉炼出优质生铁，能供碱性转炉炼好钢。据十七号小高炉从6月6日到19日一百二十八次的试验结果：硫、矽、磷含量达到小高炉一级碱性转炉炼钢生铁标准要求的有八十五次，占总次数的66.41％；生铁平均含矽量为1％到2％，含硫均在0.1％以下，接近了大洋高炉生铁的质量水平。
    冶炼优质生铁，对提高钢的质量和产量，都具有重大的意义。但是许久以来，有些人一直认为：“小高炉没有精确的仪表，设备差，储热量小，无法随时提高风温，不可能炼出优质炼钢生铁。”省委机关钢铁厂成功的事实，打破了这一错误的论断，为小洋高炉冶炼优质生铁开辟了道路。
    在省委的指示下，省委机关钢铁厂一直十分重视生铁质量。但是过去只注意脱硫，而且只是以含硫0.2％为目标，对进一步降低硫和矽、磷等的含量，则注意不够。由于生铁中矽的含量高，以致炼钢时间长、吹损率大。为了适应炼钢的需要，这个厂在国家科学技术委员会和冶金工业部工作组的协助和指导下，根据合肥钢铁厂提出的碱性转炉优质炼钢生铁的质量指标（含硫0.2％以下，其中含硫在0.1％以下的一级品要占50％以上；含矽1％到2％；含磷0.3％到0.5％；含锰0.5％；碳的含量不低于3％），在5月29日开始了冶炼试验。
    科学的实践证明：生铁中的磷和锰比较容易控制，主要取决于配料，而控制硫和矽的含量是比较困难的。因此，在开始试验时，思想阻力很大。厂党委一方面在职工群众中进行了深入细致的思想教育工作，同时从组织方面加强了技术管理、原材料管理和化验工作。在技术管理方面，他们经过刻苦钻研，摸索出了一套比较科学的小高炉冶炼优质炼钢生铁的技术操作规程：固定料批、调剂焦比，使炉料分布均匀；经常检查炉顶设备，及时校正料钟中心线，做到合理布料；推广高温大风，稳定送风制度，风温定为六百到六百二十度，风压定为二百三十到二百五十公厘水银柱；稳定造渣制度，保证造好渣和提高炉渣碱度；充分利用煤气，加重焦炭负荷，降低焦比；三班统一操作，严格执行交接班制度。在冶炼过程中，他们特别注意了脱硫、降低含矽工作或通过提高炉缸温度和炉渣碱度，降低了含硫量；通过提高技术操作水平，保持正常的炉温，大大降低了含矽量。实践证明：生铁中的硫主要是在炉缸内脱去，矽是在风口上面炉腹部分还原，只要保持正常的炉温，脱硫和减少含矽可以同时进行，矛盾可以统一。
    在加强原材料管理方面，实行了分类堆放，分级入炉，严格控制矿石破碎粒度，做到粗粮细作，让高炉吃好。
    在加强化验工作方面，改变了过去化验单只和领导人员见面的做法，化验单和群众直接见面，通过广播及时向群众宣布化验结果，有力地促进了生铁质量的提高。
    省委机关钢铁厂职工在“小洋炉和大洋炉媲美”和“大破四关（质量、产量、焦比、成本），质量第一，向七一献礼”的战斗口号激励下，经过苦干巧干，现在已有五座小高炉顺利地炼出了优质炼钢生铁，并且保持了正常的产量。其中容积为十三立方公尺的十七号小高炉，日产量一直保持在十吨以上（矿石品位最高仅为45％），达到了优质高产。
    本报讯　中共山东省委、山东省人民委员会机关炼铁试验厂，今年以来，优质高产运动始终不懈，成绩显著。1至5月份的高炉平均利用系数达到1.29，生铁平均合格率在93％以上，五个月的生铁产量计划也超额完成了。
    这个厂的四座小高炉开炉以来，生产基本上一直保持正常，日产量都超过了设计水平。因此，曾几次被评为省、市的“红旗炉”、“标兵炉”、“长寿炉”。
    这个厂所以一直生产比较好，是因为省、市负责人经常到现场指导，厂党委采取了以虚带实的领导方法。领导干部随时注意群众的思想动态，及时进行教育，使职工们经常保持饱满的劳动热情。领导干部还经常深入车间，通过参加体力劳动，抓重点，抓关键，抓薄弱环节。
    在组织正常生产方面，他们采取了多种有效措施。他们非常重视原料准备工作，原料到厂以后，即分别按矿区堆存，经过化验了解成分以后再破碎入炉。为了让高炉吃饱、吃细、吃好，厂里规定了四不入炉的投料制度：不干不入炉，筛不净不入炉，粒度不匀不入炉，成分不明不入炉。为了保证炉况顺行，他们按照“防重于治”的精神，实行了“三勤”（勤检查、勤分析研究、遇炉况失常时勤调剂）操作法。他们还规定了严格的高炉设备维护和检修制度，以及交接班等制度。
    这个厂很重视生铁质量，采取了“处处设关，关关脱硫”的综合脱硫措施。生铁合格率长期保持在90％以上，有时达到100％。
    据新华社讯　山东省冶金工业局在济南举办的冶金干部现场训练班在6月23日开学。
    训练班的成员将通过现场参观访问和交流经验，重点观摩中共山东省委、省人民委员会机关炼铁试验厂的生产实况。
    在开学典礼上，省委书记处书记、副省长邓辰西，勉励训练班的成员认真对待这次训练，使本单位的生产水平向省委、省人委机关炼铁试验厂看齐。
