Shaanxi Summarizes Rich Harvest Experience to Promote Winter Planting
Summarizing at Each Level Through Extensive Evaluation and Exhibition; Start Deep Plowing, Accumulating Manure, and Preparing Good Seed

(Our newspaper, Xi'an, July 22nd) Shaanxi Province is adopting a method combining the masses, leadership, and technical personnel, and combining top-down and bottom-up approaches, to seize the time after the summer harvest to summarize this year's wheat harvest experience and promptly implement it in the preparation for winter wheat planting, laying the foundation for next year's wheat harvest.

After the start of this year's wheat harvest, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a notice requiring all localities to conscientiously summarize and exchange wheat planting experiences. Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Bai Zhimin, Secretary, and others personally went to people's communes and production teams in Qianxian, Xingping, and other places to hold discussions with experienced farmers, labor models, cadres, and agricultural scientific workers on this year's rich wheat harvest experience. After each county summarized the rich wheat harvest experience and held a wheat rich harvest evaluation exhibition, relevant provincial leading departments and agricultural scientific research departments held three meetings in Wugong from late June to early July, with more than 200 people, including cadres, experienced farmers, labor models, and agricultural scientific and technical personnel, to summarize the experience of wheat irrigation, rust prevention, and close planting. At the same time, a summer harvest crop rich harvest evaluation exhibition was held in Xi'an, showcasing the experience of eighteen special districts, counties, and cities in southern Shaanxi and Guanzhong areas. After concentrating the experiences of various localities, in addition to the Summer Harvest Headquarters holding several meetings to study it, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also convened heads of agricultural work departments from local district committees and county committees to discuss this year's rich harvest experience of wheat and other summer crops, as well as issues related to winter planting area, yield, and measures. Currently, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is disseminating these opinions to production teams at each level, mobilizing the masses to discuss them extensively, and plans to hold a six-level cadre meeting for the wheat producing areas of the province in early August to jointly summarize this year's rich harvest experience of wheat and other summer crops, determine winter wheat planting measures, and ensure a rich wheat harvest next year.

According to this year's rich wheat harvest experience, relevant leading departments in Shaanxi Province believe that to achieve a rich harvest of wheat and other summer crops next year, it is first necessary to do a good job in sowing, lay the foundation for full and strong seedlings, and strive to avoid or minimize the occurrence of third-class seedlings. The key to good sowing depends on making sufficient preparations as early as possible. In order to prepare early, it is necessary to implement plans for winter planting area, yield, and measures to the production teams. To this end, relevant departments first put forward preliminary opinions on appropriately expanding the wheat planting area, as well as the planting area and yield increase of summer miscellaneous grains and rapeseed, and disseminated these opinions to production teams at each level, mobilizing the masses to fully discuss them and make decisions from the bottom up, adapting to local conditions. At the same time, it was also pointed out that all localities should currently focus on the following winter planting preparations: First, seize the fallow season to deep plow the land. All of the province's more than 14 million mu of idle land that was not deep plowed last year should strive to be completely plowed before the beginning of autumn. Second, focus on fertilizer. Increase the proportion of base fertilizer, ensure the quality of base fertilizer, and combine deep plowing with fertilization. In addition to planting 2 million mu of green manure this year, the Guanzhong area will also establish professional fertilizer accumulation teams to carry out regular fertilizer accumulation. At the same time, from now until the beginning of September before winter planting, it is required to launch two or three mass mobilization fertilizer accumulation campaigns every month. Third, focus on strip planting and prepare strip planting machines. Fourth, seize timely sowing.

This method of summarizing experience and formulating plans by combining bottom-up and top-down approaches, and combining the masses, leadership, and technical cadres, has already played a significant role. In Dali, Pucheng, and other counties, which have made the fastest progress, based on mobilizing the masses to summarize the rich harvest experience, preliminary plans for the entire county have been made, submitted to various production teams for discussion, and then collected from the bottom up to make decisions, and the winter planting preparation work is progressing rapidly. Dali County has determined that the wheat harvest area next year will increase from 840,000 mu this year to 900,000 mu, and the average yield per mu is planned to increase by 25%. Up to now, all 198,000 mu of fallow land in the county have been completely deep plowed, and the general quality has met the requirements, with a total of 224,000 mu of green manure pressed down, exceeding the original plan by more than double; the seed exchange required for good seed combinations and the strip planting machines required for sowing have also been prepared.

Currently, the province's fertilizer accumulation and land deep plowing campaign has been launched enthusiastically. According to statistics, more than 1,800 billion jin of fertilizer has been accumulated. In terms of land plowing, the fourteen counties and cities in Guanzhong alone have deep plowed 2.73 million mu of land. The quality of seeds in various places is generally better than in previous years, and the quantity is also sufficient. In order to solve the problem of variety exchange in good seed combinations in various places, relevant provincial departments have purchased 43 million jin of good seeds.

### 陕西总结丰产经验促进冬种  逐级总结广泛评比展览　开始深翻地积肥准备良种

    陕西总结丰产经验促进冬种
    逐级总结广泛评比展览　开始深翻地积肥准备良种
    本报西安22日电　陕西省采取群众、领导、技术人员相结合，自下而上与自上而下相结合的办法，在夏收后期抓紧总结今年小麦丰收经验，并及时贯彻到小麦冬种准备工作中去，为明年小麦丰收奠定基础。
    在今年小麦收割开始后，中共陕西省委即发出通知，要求各地认真总结、交流小麦种植经验。省委第一书记张德生、书记白治民等曾亲自到乾县、兴平等地的人民公社、生产队，和老农、劳动模范、干部、农业科学工作者，座谈今年小麦的丰产经验。在各县总结小麦丰产经验，举办小麦丰产评比展览之后，省级有关领导部门和农业科学研究部门从6月下旬到7月上旬，在武功举行了三次有干部、老农、劳动模范、农业科学技术人员等二百多人共同参加的会议，总结了小麦灌溉、防锈以及密植等经验。同时，还在西安举行了陕南、关中地区十八个专、县、市的夏收作物丰产评比展览会。集中了各地经验以后，除了夏收指挥部专门召集几次会议研究外，中共陕西省委还召集各地地委、县委农工部长，就今年小麦等夏田丰收经验和有关冬种面积、产量以及措施等问题进行了座谈。目前，中共陕西省委正将这些意见逐级下达到各地生产队，发动群众广泛讨论，并计划在8月初分区召开全省小麦产区的六级干部会议，共同总结今年小麦等夏田丰产经验，确定小麦冬播措施，保证明年小麦丰收。
    陕西省有关领导部门根据今年小麦丰产经验认为，要取得明年小麦等夏田丰产，首先要过好播种关，给苗全苗壮打下基础，力争不出三类苗或少出三类苗。作好播种的关键又决定于及早的进行充分准备。为了及早准备，又必须将有关冬种的面积、产量、措施等计划落实到生产队。为此，有关部门首先提出了有关适当扩大小麦播种面积以及夏杂粮、油菜播种面积和单位面积产量增长幅度的初步意见，并将这些意见逐级下达到生产队，发动群众充分讨论，因地制宜，自下而上的定案。同时，还指出各地当前应全力抓下列各项冬种准备：一是抓伏期深翻地。全省一千四百多万亩休闲地去年没有深翻的力争立秋前全部翻完。二是抓肥料。增加底肥比重，保证底肥质量，结合深翻施肥。关中地区今年除要种绿肥二百万亩外，还要建立积肥专业队，进行经常积肥，同时从现在起到9月上旬的冬种前，每月要求发动两三次全民动手的突击积肥运动。三是抓条播，准备好条播机。四要抓及时播种。
    这种自下而上、自上而下和群众、领导、技术干部相结合的总结经验制订计划的办法，已经发生了很大的作用。进展最快的大荔、蒲城等县，在发动群众总结丰产经验的基础上，作出了全县初步方案，已经交各生产队讨论，并由下而上集中起来定案，冬种准备工作进展很快。大荔县确定明年小麦收获面积要由今年的八十四万亩增加到九十万亩，平均亩产量计划增加25％。到现在为止，全县十九万八千多亩休闲地已全部完成了深翻，一般质量都达到要求，共压绿肥二十二万四千亩，超过原计划的一倍以上；按良种组合所需的种子调换以及播种所需的条播机，也都准备就绪。
    现在，全省积肥和深翻土地运动已经热烈展开，据统计，已积肥一万八千多亿斤。在翻地方面，仅关中十四个县市，已深翻土地二百七十三万亩。各地今年种子质量一般比往年好，数量也足。为了解决各地良种组合中品种调换问题，省级有关部门已收购下良种四千三百万斤。
