Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 17th: About 100,000 Korean residents in Japan held rallies in 120 locations across Japan today, demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Japanese Red Cross immediately sign the agreement reached in Geneva regarding the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

In Tokyo, the rally attended by approximately 5,500 Korean residents unanimously passed a resolution stating that the Japanese government's stance of waiting for the International Committee of the Red Cross to "agree" before signing the agreement is unreasonable. The resolution condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for delaying the signing of the agreement and pointed out that doing so was an attempt to conduct political transactions with the US government and the Syngman Rhee clique at the expense of the wishes of Korean residents in Japan.

The resolution, addressed to the Japanese government and the Japanese Red Cross, requested them to immediately sign the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan based on humanitarian principles.

Communist Party representative Toji Kameda, Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma, and General Council of Trade Unions of Japan representative Shigeru Ishikawa spoke at the meeting. Kameda Toji pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government has not acknowledged the crimes of Japanese imperialism's 36-year rule over Koreans. It is not only delaying the signing of the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan but also adopting a hostile attitude towards the people of Asia by revising the Japan-US "Security Treaty." He said that the Japanese people cannot tolerate this attitude of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

Asanuma and other speakers unanimously condemned the Japanese government for succumbing to pressure from the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique. They unanimously expressed their determination to fight for the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

After the meeting, 150 representatives of Korean residents in Japan divided into three groups and submitted the resolution of the meeting to the government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Japanese Red Cross, respectively.

The participants held a demonstration in Tokyo.

At the second national representative meeting held on the 14th, the Association for Assisting the Return of Korean Residents in Japan decided that July 23rd would be the National Unified Action Day to demand the repatriation of Korean residents. The meeting called on various Japanese organizations to launch joint actions on this day, demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Japanese Red Cross immediately sign the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan and fully implement this agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 17th: Li Yiqing, head of the Korean Red Cross delegation who just returned from Geneva, pointed out at a press conference on the 16th that the talks between the DPRK and Japan on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan have reached an agreement, and all agreement documents have also been drafted. The remaining issue is for the two delegations to sign the agreement documents. However, the Japanese side disregards the agreement already reached by both sides and avoids signing. This behavior of the Japanese side exposes its unreasonable position in front of the people of the world.

Li Yiqing said that the Japanese side has consistently maintained that it cannot sign immediately, nor can it decide on the date of signing, and that the Japanese side can only sign after obtaining the "consent" of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Li Yiqing said that the Japanese side is attempting to transfer its unshirkable responsibility for repatriating Korean residents in Japan to the International Committee of the Red Cross in order to adhere to its consistent and unjustifiable position.

Li Yiqing said that the DPRK has made all preparations to welcome the return of Korean residents and is only waiting for the Japanese side to notify the date of signing the agreement.

Li Yiqing pointed out that the issue of the DPRK and Japan signing the agreement documents and the issues that the Japanese side needs to negotiate with the International Committee of the Red Cross are two completely distinct issues that cannot be confused. Therefore, the Japanese side has no reason not to sign the agreement already reached during the talks between the two sides. There is not a single sentence in the documents of the agreement reached by both sides saying that it can only be signed after the International Committee of the Red Cross "agrees."

Li Yiqing emphasized that all facts show that no matter what excuses the Japanese side uses, it cannot avoid signing the repatriation agreement and cannot escape the responsibility of enabling Korean residents in Japan to return to their homeland.

The Korean Red Cross delegation returned to Pyongyang from Geneva on the 15th. The delegation began talks with the Japanese Red Cross delegation in Geneva in April this year. After more than two months of negotiations, the two sides reached an agreement and completed the drafting of the agreement documents on June 24. However, the Japanese side has been delaying the formal signing of the agreement documents on the pretext that these agreements must be "approved" by the International Committee of the Red Cross.

    反对日本当局无理阻挠
    十万旅日朝侨集会要求回祖国
    李一卿指出日方拖延签字毫无道理
    新华社17日讯  东京消息：十万旅日朝侨今天在日本全国一百二十个地方举行大会，要求岸信介政府和日本红十字会立即签署在日内瓦达成的关于旅日朝侨回国问题的协议。
    在东京，约有五千五百名朝侨参加的大会一致通过决议，指出日本政府所采取的等红十字会国际委员会“同意”以后才签署协议的立场是没有道理的。决议谴责岸信介政府拖延签署协议，并且指出这样做是企图用牺牲旅日朝侨的愿望的办法同美国政府和李承晚集团进行政治交易。
    这项致日本政府和日本红十字会的决议，要求它们根据人道主义精神立即签署朝侨回国问题协议。
    共产党代表龟田东伍、社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎、日本工会总评议会代表石川茂等在大会上讲了话。龟田东伍指出，岸信介政府并没有承认日本帝国主义统治朝鲜人三十六年的罪恶。它不仅拖延签署朝侨回国问题协议，而且通过修改日美“安全条约”对亚洲人民采取敌视态度。他说，日本人民不能容忍岸信介政府的这种态度。
    浅沼和其他发言者一致谴责日本政府屈从美国和李承晚集团的压力。他们一致表示决心为使朝侨回国而斗争。
    大会结束后，一百五十名朝侨代表分成三队，分别向政府、外务省和日本红十字会提交了大会的决议。
    与会者在东京市内举行了示威游行。
    旅日朝侨归国协助会在14日召开的第二次全国代表会议上决定7月23日为要求送回朝侨全国统一行动日。会议呼吁日本各界团体在这一天展开联合行动，要求岸信介政府和日本红十字会立即签署关于朝侨回国问题的协议和完全履行这项协议。
    新华社平壤17日电　刚刚从日内瓦回来的朝鲜红十字会代表团团长李一卿16日在记者招待会上指出，朝日双方关于遣送旅日朝侨回国问题的会谈已经取得协议，也制订好了一切协议文件，剩下的问题就是双方代表团在协议文件上签字。但是，日方却不顾双方已经达成的协议，回避签字，日方这种行为在世界人民面前暴露出自己的无理立场。
    李一卿说，日本方面一贯主张：它不能立即签字，也不能决定签字的日子，只能在得到红十字国际委员会“同意”以后日方才能签字。李一卿说，日方是企图把它遣送旅日朝侨回国的不可推卸的责任转嫁给红十字国际委员会，以坚持它的一贯不正当的立场。
    李一卿说，朝方已经作好迎接朝侨回国的一切准备，只等待日本方面通知签署协议的日子。
    李一卿指出，朝日双方在协议文件上签字的问题和日方需要同红十字国际委员会协商解决的问题完全是不容混淆的两个问题。因此，日方毫无理由不在双方会谈已经达成的协议上签字。双方达成协议的文件中没有半句话说要在红十字国际委员会“同意”后才能签字。
    李一卿强调说，一切事实说明：不管日本方面用任何借口，也不能回避在遣送朝侨协议上签字，不能逃脱使旅日朝侨归国的责任。
    朝鲜红十字会代表团是15日从日内瓦回到平壤的。代表团从今年4月开始在日内瓦同日本红十字会代表团会谈，经过了二个多月的谈判，双方取得了协议，并且在6月24日完成了起草协议文件的工作。但是日本方面借口这些协议要得到红十字国际委员会的“同意”，一直拖延在协议文件上正式签字。（附图片）
