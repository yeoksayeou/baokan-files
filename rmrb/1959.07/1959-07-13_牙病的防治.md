    Prevention and Treatment of Dental Diseases
    Fu Lianzhang
    Do not underestimate teeth. If teeth are lost, food cannot be chewed finely, which will affect digestion and lead to other diseases. Moreover, toothache can cause a person to lose sleep and appetite, and feel restless. Many people have experienced this kind of pain.
    Why do teeth hurt? The outermost layer of the tooth, the enamel, has little sensation. The dentin under the enamel also has only a slight feeling. Only the very center of the tooth—the pulp—has the most sensitive feeling because it has rich nerves and blood vessels. Therefore, toothache is often caused by disease changes that have invaded the deep part of the tooth. There are many kinds of dental diseases, and the most common is dental caries, also known as "tooth worms." In fact, there are no worms. The causes of dental caries are: on the one hand, it may be due to the poor structural quality of the teeth, such as the lack of important minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, and fluorine, or the lack of vitamin D, which is closely related to calcium and phosphorus metabolism. On the other hand, it may be due to unclean teeth, with food residues, especially sugars, which produce acid due to the fermentation of bacteria in the mouth. The acid erodes the teeth, causing dental caries. Dental caries begins with a small hole forming on the tooth, gradually expanding to the pulp and even the root. Bacteria also invade and cause inflammation, and this inflammatory stimulation can cause unbearable pain. More seriously, due to the spread of root inflammation, the cheeks can swell and the whole body can develop a fever. In a few cases, a large number of bacteria can even enter the blood and cause dangerous septicemia. Therefore, toothache should not be ignored.
    Why do teeth fall out? The tooth root is originally grown in the solid alveolar bone, and there is a layer of periodontal membrane between the alveolar bone and the tooth, which firmly connects the two. This is like tying something to a big tree. The periodontal membrane is the rope. If the rope breaks, the thing being tied will fall off. Therefore, the cause of tooth loss is mostly due to periodontal disease. The common causes of periodontal inflammation are unclean teeth and the formation of dental plaque. Dental plaque grows on the teeth near the gums. It is a yellowish-brown, stone-hard substance, a mixed precipitate of residual organic matter and calcium in saliva. Like other dirt remaining in the tooth crevices, it can stimulate the gums and cause inflammation, which in turn invades the periodontal membrane, creating conditions for tooth loosening and loss.
    Many people believe that "tooth loss in old age" is an inevitable phenomenon, but this is not the case. Although the gums and alveolar bone will shrink somewhat in old age, the tooth roots will be exposed longer, and the teeth will be worn down to some extent, thus increasing the factors of tooth loosening and susceptibility to dental diseases. However, tooth loss is ultimately caused by dental disease, and most dental diseases can be prevented. I am already sixty-five years old this year, and my teeth are still intact, which also illustrates that "tooth loss in old age" is not an inevitable rule.
    There are many ways to prevent dental diseases. Where conditions permit, it is best to have a dentist examine your teeth once a year to remove dental plaque and correct some defects. Here, I will only put forward three most important points for preventing and treating dental diseases:
    First, pay attention to keeping your teeth clean: The dental caries and periodontal disease mentioned above are related to unclean teeth, so you must constantly clean the food residues accumulated in the tooth crevices in time and prevent them from staying, so as to avoid fermentation that damages the teeth and periodontal tissues.
    Second, treat dental diseases early and fill missing teeth early: In the early stage of dental caries, the cavity is still small, and it can be cured if it is filled; if the damage is large, it must be extracted quickly to avoid causing serious diseases of the tooth roots and alveolar bone. If a tooth is lost, it should be replaced with a denture as soon as possible, because if a tooth is lost for a long time, the adjacent teeth will skew towards the vacant space, and the opposite teeth will also elongate towards the vacant space, which will make the teeth messy, widen the tooth crevices, and easily lead to new dental diseases.
    Third, give the teeth the necessary exercise: This is to eat some fibrous vegetables and coarse grains and other relatively rough foods, and to develop the habit of "eating slowly and chewing carefully." This can activate the blood circulation of the alveolar bone, dental pulp, and gums, thereby enhancing the strength of the teeth, gums, and alveolar bone, and preventing premature atrophy. Ancient China not only understood the benefits of rinsing and brushing teeth very early, but also knew the benefits of tooth exercise very early. In the past, some people advocated a tooth-tapping exercise. Lin Hong of the Song Dynasty had a poem: "When the heat is extreme, the wind causes restlessness in the teeth; tapping and rinsing in the early morning makes one feel refreshed. If one uses it regularly without interruption, he may still not lose teeth in old age." This is very scientific. However, simple tapping can easily damage the teeth. Eating some rough foods and developing the habit of eating slowly and chewing carefully are more appropriate methods.

    牙病的防治
    傅连暲
    不能小看了牙齿，如果牙齿掉了，食物不能精细的咀嚼，就会影响消化，还能带来其它的疾病。再说牙痛更可以使人达到寝食俱废坐立不安的地步，很多人都领略过这种痛苦的滋味。
    牙齿为什么会痛呢？本来牙齿最外面的牙釉质层是没有什么知觉的，牙釉质下面的象牙质也只有轻度的感觉，唯有牙的最中心的部分——牙髓，因为有了丰富的神经血管，感觉才最灵敏。因此感到牙痛，常常是疾病变化侵犯到了牙齿的深部。这样的牙病有很多种，而最常见的是龋齿，也就是俗称的“虫牙”。其实并没有什么虫子，造成龋齿的原因：一方面可能由于牙齿的实质结构不好，如像缺少钙、磷、氟这样一些重要的矿物质，或者缺少与钙磷代谢密切相关的维生素丁。另一方面可能由于牙齿的不清洁，存在有食物残渣特别是糖类的东西，因口腔内细菌的发酵作用而产生酸，酸对牙齿的侵蚀，就引起了龋齿的发生。龋齿的开始是在牙齿上面形成一个小洞，逐步扩展到牙髓甚至牙根，细菌也随之侵入而发生炎症，而这种炎症刺激就能给人带来难以忍受的疼痛。更严重的是，由于牙根炎症的扩延，可使面颊肿胀，全身发烧。在少数情况下，甚至细菌大量进入血液发生危险的败血症。所以对于牙痛的病也是不能忽视的。
    牙齿为什么会掉呢？本来牙根是长在稳固的牙槽骨里面，在牙槽骨和牙齿之间有一层牙周膜把二者牢牢地联结在一起。这就好像把一件东西缚在大树上一样，牙周膜就是绳子，绳子断了，被缚的东西就要掉下来，所以牙齿脱落的原因多半是牙周的疾病所致。引起牙周炎症常见的原因是牙齿不清洁和牙垢的生成。牙垢长在牙齿靠近牙龈肉的地方，它是一种黄褐色坚硬如石的东西，是残存的有机物质与唾液中钙质的混合沉殿物，它与残存在牙缝里的其它污物一样都能刺激牙龈肉而引起炎症，进而侵犯到牙周膜，这就造成牙齿松动和脱落的条件。
    很多人认为“老年掉牙”是一种不可避免的现象，其实不然。虽然老年时牙龈肉和牙槽骨都要萎缩一些，牙根暴露得长一些，牙齿也磨损了一部分，因而增加了牙齿松动和易患牙病的因素。但是牙齿的脱落毕竟都是由于牙病引起的，而牙病大都可以预防。我今年已经六十五岁了，牙齿还是完整无缺，这也可以说明“年老掉牙”并不是什么必然的规律了。
    牙病预防的方法很多，有条件的地方，每年最好请牙医师检查一次，剔除牙垢和矫治一些缺点，在这里我只提出防治牙病最重要的三点：
    第一、要注意保护牙齿的洁净：前面举出的龋齿和牙周病都与牙齿的不清洁有关，所以要不断地把牙缝里积存的食物残渣及时清洗，不让它停留，以免发酵损害牙齿和牙周组织。
    第二、牙病早治，牙缺早补：龋齿的早期，龋洞还小，如果加以填补就能治好；破坏大了，就要很快的拔掉，以免引起严重的牙根和牙槽骨的疾病。如果牙齿掉了，也要早些安上假牙，因为一个牙齿掉的久了，相邻的牙就要向这个缺空方向偏斜，相对的牙也要向这个缺空方向伸长，这就使牙齿零乱，牙缝加宽，容易患新的牙病。
    第三、要给予牙齿以必要的锻炼：这就是要吃些富于纤维的蔬菜和杂粮等比较粗糙的食物，以及养成“慢吃细嚼”的习惯。因为这样能活跃牙槽骨、牙髓和牙龈肉的血液循环，从而增进牙齿牙龈和牙槽骨的强壮，防止过早的萎缩。我国古代不仅很早就懂得了漱口刷牙的好处，而且也很早就知道了牙齿锻炼的好处。从前就有人提倡过一种叩击牙齿的运动，宋代林洪有一首诗：“热极风生齿不宁，侵晨叩漱曰惺惺，若教运用无常隔，还许他年老不零。”这是很有科学道理的。不过单纯的叩击，容易损伤牙齿，吃些粗糙食物和养成慢吃细嚼的习惯是更为妥善的方法。
