(Reported by our newspaper) The Changjiang Brigade of the Changjiang Commune in Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, achieved a bumper harvest of wheat this year. The average per-mu yield of 21,000 mu of wheat was 330.6 jin, and both the per-mu yield and total output doubled compared to last year. This is the fruitful result of the brigade's ten years of solid agricultural capital construction.

The Changjiang Brigade has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, unseen in the past twenty years in Kaizhou. The 21,000 mu of wheat yielded an average of 330.6 jin per mu, doubling last year's yield, and the total output increased by 107%. This summer, the brigade delivered 5.49 million jin of grain to the state, exceeding the total amount delivered for the entire last year by 1.52 million jin. The income of the commune members doubled.

Twenty years ago, the island where the Changjiang Brigade is located was a barren, reed-covered shoal. At that time, the river embankments were in disrepair, and the water system within the island was chaotic. In the first ten years after the island was developed, there were minor floods twice a year in summer and autumn, and major floods every three years. The 1943 flood submerged the entire island, earning it the name "Big Water Tank," which spread far and wide. In addition to the threat of flooding, there were several other difficulties in this area: first, there was little labor relative to the land, resulting in extensive but low-yield farming; second, the island had no mountains and few ponds, leading to a lack of fertilizer sources, and no fertilizer had been applied in ten years, causing soil fertility to decrease by 3% annually; and third, insect pests were severe. As a result, the average annual yield per mu was only 40 to 50 jin. Farmers described the wheat here as being so short that "a toad could reach the ears of wheat with its arms outstretched." The people of the Changjiang Brigade carried out their arduous agricultural capital construction project on this barren, reed-covered shoal.

Over the past ten years, under the leadership and assistance of the Party, the entire brigade has built more than 100 water conservancy projects, with earthwork reaching 4.85 million cubic meters. Starting in 1951, with the help of the state, they also carried out various agricultural capital construction projects related to machinery, fertilizer, and soil. The brigade now owns more than 200 tractors, threshers, pumps, and other machines, has improved approximately 2,000 mu of soil, and has made great progress in fertilizer construction. The brigade has built more than 100 local fertilizer plants and more than 10,000 human-made manure pits, fumigation soil kilns, pigsties, and human-made covered ditches. All these basic construction projects have provided favorable conditions for implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and increasing production.

The speed of agricultural capital construction in the Changjiang Brigade has been quite fast, and it has indeed played a decisive role in increasing wheat production. Taking water conservancy as an example, the total amount of earthwork in 1953 was only over 200,000 cubic meters, but in 1958 it jumped to 1.27 million cubic meters, an increase of more than five times. Because the irrigation and drainage system has been comprehensively repaired, the groundwater level in the wheat fields this year is five to eight inches lower than in the same period in 1957, which has effectively guaranteed the safe growth of wheat. These basic construction projects have also provided the necessary material conditions for implementing various yield-increasing technical measures. For example, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of wheat this year exceeded 18 times that of 1953. Furthermore, the increase in mechanized plowing is the main condition for deep plowing last year. Last year, the area of mechanized plowing accounted for 25% of the total wheat field area, with an average depth of seven inches. At the same time, the use of mechanized plowing and new agricultural tools is also a prerequisite for solving the problem of labor shortage. All these facts show that only sufficient material conditions can achieve sufficient harvests! The bumper wheat harvest in the Changjiang Brigade this year is the result of their ten years of hard work.

However, the basic construction of the Changjiang Brigade in the autumn planting of 1957 was similar to that of the autumn planting of 1958, so why was the increase in wheat production this year much greater than last year? Here, the human factor played a decisive role. During the autumn planting last year, inspired by the upsurge of communization, the commune members across the brigade launched a deep plowing campaign. Eight tractors worked in shifts, day and night, fully utilizing the potential of the machinery. For example, in fertilizer accumulation, cadres and commune members throughout the brigade braved the snow to dig frozen ground, and faced the cold wind late at night and the cold frost in the early morning, overcoming all difficulties to complete more than 1.2 million cubic meters of earthwork, and then extracted more than 20% more river mud from these excavated river channels than in 1957. These facts also fully demonstrate that sufficient material conditions are an important guarantee for sufficient harvests; and sufficient enthusiasm is the decisive factor for creating material conditions more quickly and fully utilizing the effectiveness of these conditions. As the masses of this brigade said: "Thousands of things matter, but hard work comes first!"

The contradiction of less labor and more land in the Changjiang Brigade has not been resolved for a long time. In agricultural capital construction, labor is a fundamental issue. Without people, nothing can be discussed. Starting in 1954, the state allocated a tractor to them, which opened people's eyes and made them realize that the fundamental way to solve the labor problem is to gradually implement mechanization. From 1955 to 1958, in addition to the agricultural machinery aided by the state, the brigade also purchased a tractor, a pump, two harvesters, and a large thresher. However, these agricultural machines still could not solve the contradiction between the lack of labor and the need for faster and more meticulous cultivation in the process of increasingly higher production requirements. In 1956, they purchased a flour mill and established a small flour mill, liberating 180,000 man-days. In 1958, by using old materials to renovate three motorized trailers, they saved more than 90,000 transportation man-days. Women's labor has been basically liberated since the establishment of the People's Commune. In 1958, the labor directly invested in agricultural production in the entire brigade increased by nearly one times compared to 1956. The quality of cultivation has generally improved.

They also regard new agricultural tools and plowing cattle as the inevitable path to fully realizing mechanization. They pay special attention to strengthening the feeding and breeding of plowing cattle. In 1958, the number of plowing cattle in the entire brigade increased by more than 40% compared to 1956. The brigade cadres said: "The early completion of the autumn planting last year was largely due to the contribution of the 526 large castrated oxen!"

Basic construction cannot be separated from funds and technical strength. The Changjiang Brigade completed so many agricultural infrastructure projects, and their money and people are basically solved by giving full play to their own strength and effectively utilizing foreign aid. In addition to the annual river embankment repair funds and a batch of agricultural machinery directly aided by the state, the remaining funds are all raised by the brigade itself. They also overcame the difficulties of technical strength with the same spirit of self-reliance.

The ten years of dedicated construction by the Changjiang Brigade have enabled production to have the necessary material conditions. Now they are breaking through the fertilizer barrier and creating material conditions that meet higher production requirements, so that they can continue to leap forward in agricultural production.

### 踏踏实实打基础　精雕细刻抓技术  长江大队十年建设结下丰硕果  二万一千亩三麦亩产量和总产量都比去年增加一倍

    踏踏实实打基础　精雕细刻抓技术
    长江大队十年建设结下丰硕果
    二万一千亩三麦亩产量和总产量都比去年增加一倍
    本报讯　江苏省江宁县长江公社长江大队今年三麦获得特大丰收，二万一千亩三麦平均亩产三百三十点六斤，亩产量与总产量都比去年翻了一番。这是这个队十年来踏踏实实进行农业基本建设获得的丰硕之果。
    长江大队今年获得开洲二十年来从未有过的特大丰收。二万一千亩三麦亩产三百三十点六斤，比去年翻了一番，总产量更增加107％。全队夏季给国家交了五百四十九万斤粮食比去年全年交的还多一百五十二万斤。社员收入增加一倍。
    二十年前，长江大队所在的洲地还是一片荒洲柴滩。当时江堤失修，洲内水系混乱。开洲的前十年，平均每年夏秋两次小水灾，三年一次大水灾。1943年的内涝淹没全洲，“大水缸”的名字从此远近传开。这地方除了水患，还有几个难处：一是地多人少，劳力不足，只能广种薄收；二是洲地无山少塘，肥源缺乏，十年中未施过一次肥，土壤肥效逐年递减3％；三是虫灾严重。因此每亩地平均年产量只有四十斤到五十斤。农民形容这里的麦子是“癞蛤蟆伸胳膊就能捞到麦穗”。长江大队的人们，就是在这样一个荒洲柴滩上，进行了他们艰巨的农业基本建设工程。
    十年来，他们在党的领导与扶助下，全大队共兴修了一百多项水利工程，土方工程达到四百八十五万土方。1951年开始，在国家的帮助下，又进行了机械、肥料、土壤等各项农业基本建设。现在全队拥有拖拉机、脱粒机、抽水机等二百多台，改良土壤二千亩左右，肥料建设也获得很大成绩。全队兴建土化肥厂一百多个，人造粪坑、熏土窑、猪圈、人造阴沟等共一万多个。这些基本建设全为贯彻八字宪法，提高产量，提供了有利条件。
    长江大队农业基本建设的速度是相当快的，它对三麦增产确是起了决定性的作用。以水利来说，1953年土方工程总量不过二十多万土方，1958年就跃升到一百二十七万土方，猛增五倍多。由于排灌系统经过全面整修，今年麦田的地下水位比1957年同期降低五寸到八寸，这就有力地保障了三麦的安全生长。这些基本建设又为贯彻各项增产技术措施，提供了必要的物质条件。例如今年每亩麦田平均施肥量超过了1953年的十八倍。再如，机耕力量的增加，是去年深耕的主要条件。去年机耕面积占麦田总面积的25％，平均深度是七寸。同时，机耕和新式农具的使用，又是解决劳动力不足问题的前提。所有这些都说明：只有十足的物质条件，才能取得十足的收成！长江大队今年的三麦丰收，正是他们十年来辛勤劳动的结果。
    但是，1957年秋种时，长江大队的基本建设和1958年秋种时差不多，为什么今年的三麦增产幅度却大大超过去年呢？这里人的因素起了决定性作用。去年秋种时，全队社员在公社化的高潮鼓舞下，掀起了深翻土地运动。八部拖拉机分班操作，日夜抢耕，充分发挥了机械的潜在能力。再如积肥，全大队干部社员冒大雪挖冻地，深夜顶寒风，清晨披冷霜，不顾一切困难，完成了一百二十多万土方，以后又从这些开挖的河道中取出了超过1957年20％的河泥。这些事实又充分说明了，十足的物质条件是十足收成的重要保证；而十足的干劲，又是较快地创造物质条件和充分发挥这些条件效能的决定性的因素。正如这个大队群众说：“千头万头，干字当头！”
    长江大队劳力少，土地多的矛盾，长期以来未得解决。在农业基本建设中，劳力是一个根本问题。没有人，什么事也谈不上。1954年开始，国家调拨了一部拖拉机给他们，这就打开了人们的眼界，使他们认识到解决劳力的根本道路，是逐步实行机械化。1955年到1958年除国家帮助他们的农业机械外，大队又购置了一部拖拉机，一部抽水机，两部收割机，一部大型脱谷机。但是这些农业机械还不能解决在增产要求日益提高过程中劳力缺乏和耕作加快加细的矛盾。1956年他们购置了一台面粉机，建立起一座小型面粉厂，解放了十八万个人工。1958年，利用旧料改装了三部机动拖车，又节约运输劳力九万多个。妇女劳力在人民公社成立后基本上得到解放。1958年全队直接投入农业生产的劳力，就比1956年增加近一倍。耕作质量普遍提高。
    他们还把新式农具和耕牛，看作是全面实现机械化的必经之路。他们特别重视加强对耕牛的饲养和增殖。1958年全队耕牛比1956年增加40％以上。大队干部说：“去年秋种提前完成，五百二十六条大犍牛功劳不小”！
    进行基本建设，离不了资金和技术力量。长江大队完成这么多的农业基建项目，他们的钱和人基本是靠充分发挥自己的力量，再加上有效地利用外援来解决。除了国家直接援助的江堤年修经费和一批农业机械外，其余资金全由大队自己筹集。他们还以同样的自力更生精神，克服了技术力量的困难。
    长江大队十年的埋头建设，已使增产具备了必需的物质条件。现在他们正在突破肥料关，创造出适应更高增产要求的物质条件，以便在农业生产上继续跃进。（附图片）
