To closely coordinate with Tibet's current movement to suppress the rebellion and speak bitterness, and the upcoming democratic reform movement, the Henan Opera Troupe of the Tibet Work Committee is vigorously carrying out performance and creation activities. Some of the troupe's directors and actors rushed to rehearse the Peking Opera "The White Haired Girl"; the other personnel went deep into the Drepung Monastery in the western suburbs of Lhasa to collect materials and write modern opera scripts.

After "The White Haired Girl" was rehearsed, it was performed for the poor lamas of Drepung Monastery, and the emotional exchange between the audience and the actors was close during the performance. After the curtain call, the lamas applauded for a long time. The next day, "The White Haired Girl" was performed again in the Lhasa Auditorium, and then went to the Shannan area for a performance tour to express sympathy and solicitude.

The comrades who went to Shannan for the performance tour overcame the difficulties of wind and snow along the way, and insisted on two performances every day during the long journey. Wherever they went, they set up tents if there were no houses to live in, and if they could not find wooden poles to hang the curtain, they used empty gasoline barrels and cars to build a stage. Each performance lasted three or four hours, but their slogan was: as long as the audience watches, we can perform.

After participating in the literary and artistic creation conference convened by the Propaganda Department of the Tibet Work Committee of the Communist Party of China, another group of directors and actors of the troupe actively started the collective creation of "Tibet Blood and Tears of Hatred." At present, this large-scale opera script has been written and is being rehearsed. (Ren Dehua)

    西藏工委豫剧团结合平叛诉苦
    为藏民编新剧演新戏
    本报讯　为了紧密地配合西藏当前的平叛诉苦运动和即将来临的民主改革运动，西藏工委豫剧团大力开展演出和创作活动。这个剧团的一部分编导人员和演员们赶排了京剧“白毛女”；另一部分人员则深入拉萨西郊的哲蚌寺，收集材料，编写现代戏曲剧本。
    “白毛女”排成后，已经给哲蚌寺的贫苦喇嘛演出了一场，在演出中观众与演员之间的情感交流紧密。闭幕后，喇嘛们长时间的鼓掌。第二天，“白毛女”又在拉萨大礼堂演出一场，接着，便赴山南地区慰问演出。
    赴山南慰问演出的同志们，沿途战胜了风雪侵袭的困难，每天在长途跋涉中，还要坚持两场慰问演出。他们每到一地，没有房子住就搭起帐篷，找不到木杆子挂幕布，就用空汽油桶和汽车搭成舞台，每次演出长达三、四小时，但是他们的口号是：只要观众看，我们就能演。
    剧团的另部分编导人员和演员，在参加了中共西藏工委宣传部召开的文艺创作会议以后，积极地开始了“西藏血泪仇”的集体创作。目前，这个大型戏曲剧本已经写成，正在排练中。（任德华）
