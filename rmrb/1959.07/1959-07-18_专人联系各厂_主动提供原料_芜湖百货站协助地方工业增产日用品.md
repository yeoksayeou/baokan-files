Hefei, July 17th (People's Daily) - The Wuhu Department Store in Anhui Province is fully leveraging the commercial sector's advantages of extensive reach, keen awareness, and broad connections to actively assist local industrial departments in resolving issues related to raw materials, packaging, transportation, and equipment, fostering collaboration between industry and commerce to serve market demand.

The Wuhu Department Store is a second-level station responsible for supplying goods to seventeen counties and cities with a population of seven million four hundred thousand. In the past, purchases from other regions accounted for 60% of the station's total procurement. Since last year, in order to better supply the local residents' growing needs for daily necessities, the Wuhu Department Store has focused on local resources and strengthened the work of organizing supply sources locally. They are concerned about the production of local industries, assist local industries in overcoming production difficulties, and proactively reflect market needs and people's preferences to factories, promoting industrial departments to care about the market and actively produce urgently needed products. In the past five months, the station's actual commodity procurement has increased by 92% compared with the same period last year, with local products rising from 40% to 60% of the total procurement. Among the thirty-three major products handled by the station, ten, including matches, soap, and thermos bottles, have achieved basic self-sufficiency by relying on local sources, and five, including undershirts, vests, and batteries, have achieved partial self-sufficiency. There are also 250 kinds of small commodities that are not easy to purchase from other regions but are urgently needed by the market, which are organized from local sources to supply the market.

In addition to organizing a hundred-person visiting group to investigate production conditions, actively exploring sources of goods, and holding multiple industry-commerce collaboration meetings to exchange information, the main measures taken by the Wuhu Department Store to assist local industry in increasing the production of daily necessities are to implement a system of dedicated personnel to contact each factory, making the work of supporting industrial production and organizing sources of goods more thorough.

They combine the wholesale station's purchasing staff and sales staff into one. In the past, eight purchasing staff contacted more than 100 factories. Now, seventy-nine purchasing staff are assigned by product to contact 147 factories. In this way, the purchasing staff are more concerned about factory production. They adopt methods such as finding leaders, finding brother units, finding purchasing personnel from various counties, and finding old relationships to help factories solve problems in raw materials, packaging, transportation, equipment, and other aspects. Within five months, they found 118 kinds of raw materials for factories, such as sulfuric acid, beeswax, caustic soda, talc, and leather, worth more than 770,000 yuan. The station also dispatched automobiles and flatbed trucks to support factory transportation based on the information reflected by the purchasing staff. Simply using trucks to transport match sticks from Jing County to the match factory seven times can produce more than 3,000 cases of matches. Purchasing staff also frequently and promptly reflect market needs and public preferences to factories so that factories can arrange production according to market and consumer needs. In April, the knitting factory originally planned to only use a portion of the machines to produce undershirts and vests, and the rest to continue producing cotton interlock underwear. The purchasing staff reflected that the market demand for undershirts and vests was very large. The factory immediately changed its plan and used all machines to produce undershirts and vests. In this way, the factory's products sold well, and the department store's plan to purchase undershirts and vests was also implemented. In order to facilitate the factories, the purchasing staff changed the past practice of "waiting for customers to come to the door" and implemented the "four bringings" (bringing contracts, bringing order forms, bringing checks, bringing vehicles) and "four visits" (visiting to pay, visiting to pick up goods, visiting to sign contracts, visiting to issue orders), and "four on-site" (purchasing on-site, settling accounts on-site, allocating goods on-site, accepting goods on-site) methods to better play the role of the logistics department.

After implementing the system of dedicated personnel contacting each factory, the actual procurement results in April and May increased by 5.12% compared with the first quarter, helping factories and handicraft cooperatives expand the variety of designs and colors by 450 kinds.

    专人联系各厂　主动提供原料
    芜湖百货站协助地方工业增产日用品
    本报合肥17日电　安徽省芜湖百货站充分发挥商业部门腿长、耳灵、联系面广的特点，积极协助地方工业部门解决原料、包装、运输、设备等方面的问题，工商协作，共同为市场需求服务。
    芜湖百货站是二级站，担负十七个县市、七百四十万人口的物资供应工作。过去这个站从外地进货占进货总额的60％。去年以来，为了更好地供应当地居民对日用百货日益增长的需要，芜湖百货站面向地方，加强了就地组织货源的工作。他们关心地方工业的生产，协助地方工业克服生产中的困难，主动向工厂反映市场需要、人民爱好，推动工业部门关心市场，积极生产市场急需的产品。五个多月来，这个站采购商品实绩比去年同期增长92％，其中地方产品由过去占进货总额40％上升到60％。这个站经营的三十三种主要产品中，依靠本地货源达到基本自给的有火柴、肥皂、热水瓶等十种，部分自给的有汗衫背心、电池等五种。许多从外地不易采购、组织本地货源供应市场急需的小百货有二百五十种。
    芜湖百货站协助地方工业增产日用百货的措施，除组织百人访问团调查生产情况，积极挖掘货源，多次召开工商协作会，互通情况外，主要是实行专人分工联系各厂，把支援工业生产、组织货源工作越做越深入。
    他们把批发站的采购员和营业员合而为一，过去八个采购员联系一百多个厂，现在七十九个采购员按品种分工联系一百四十七个厂。这样，采购员更加关心工厂生产。他们采取找领导、找兄弟单位、找各县采购人员、找老关系等办法，协助工厂解决原料、包装、运输、设备等方面的问题。五个月内，他们为工厂找到硫酸、白蜡、烧碱、滑石粉、皮革等原料一百一十八种，价值七十七万余元。这个站还根据采购员反映的情况，抽调汽车、平板车支援工厂运输。仅是用汽车为火柴厂从泾县运了七趟火柴梗，就能制造三千多件火柴。采购员还经常把市场需要和群众爱好及时反映给工厂，使工厂能根据市场和消费者的需要安排生产。针织厂4月份原来只准备抽一部分机器生产汗衫背心，一部分仍生产棉毛衫裤，采购员反映汗衫背心市场需要量很大，这个厂便立刻改变计划，全部机器都用来生产汗衫背心。这样，工厂产品销路好，百货站采购汗衫背心的计划也落实了。采购员为了便利工厂，改变了过去“等客上门”的作风，实行“四带”（带合同、带单子、带支票、带车子）、“四上门”（上门付款、上门拉货、上门订合同、上门开单）、“四就”（就厂采购、就厂结账、就厂拨货、就厂验收）的办法，更好地发挥后勤部的作用。
    实行专人联系各厂以后，4、5两月收购实绩比第一季度增加5.12％，帮助工厂、手工业社扩大花色品种四百五十种。
