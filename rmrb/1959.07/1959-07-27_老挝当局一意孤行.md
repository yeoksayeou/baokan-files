    Lao Authorities Act Willfully
    By a commentator of this newspaper
    According to a joint communiqué issued by the Lao Royal Government and the French government in Vientiane on July 23, the Lao Royal Government openly decided to use various weapons and military supplies provided by the United States to train "a strong army" and requested "assistance from American military experts." This is the latest development and proof of the deliberate and thorough destruction of the Geneva Accords, expansion of the Lao civil war, and threat to peace in Indochina by American aggressive forces and Lao reactionaries. The Geneva Accords on Laos clearly stipulate that from the time of the ceasefire, all reinforcements and military personnel are prohibited from entering Laos from abroad. French military personnel can only leave a portion in specific areas at that time, and American military personnel are not allowed to enter Laos at all. This completely bankrupts all the Lao authorities' justifications and denials for their treacherous behavior, and the hideous face of American imperialism's intervention in Laos' internal affairs is even more nakedly exposed.
    The joint communiqué of the Lao authorities and the French government is an extremely dangerous signal. It shows that the United States will further implement open intervention in Lao affairs, intensify control over the army of the Kingdom of Laos, in order to realize its aggressive ambitions to finally seize Laos. As revealed by the Indian "Blitz" weekly not long ago, the purpose of American imperialism "is to crush the movement for democracy and independence in Laos, suppress the tendency of the Lao people to move towards peace and neutrality, and pull this country into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." As early as February this year, the day after Phoui Sananikone declared that he was no longer bound by the Geneva Accords, the US State Department stated that the United States could henceforth freely establish a military mission in Laos. After this, the situation in Laos rapidly deteriorated, and it developed until the Lao Royal Government forces launched an attack on the Lao Patriotic Forces in late May, brazenly provoked a civil war, and destroyed peace in Laos. All of this was due to the sinister planning of American imperialism. In fact, before instigating the Lao authorities to launch a civil war and tear up the Geneva Accords, the United States had already illegally transported a large amount of military materials and ammunition into Laos, and a large number of American military personnel had also entered Laos under various pretexts. Now American imperialism has simply instigated the Lao authorities to openly request American military personnel to "help" train the Lao army, "legalizing" the US interference in Laos' internal affairs and destruction of the Geneva Accords.
    It is especially noteworthy that while the Lao authorities are requesting "help" from American military personnel, the Lao Foreign Minister, Phagna, who is active in Bangkok, openly clamored that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the United Nations would "protect" Laos. This is certainly not accidental. Recently, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, an aggressive group manipulated by the United States, is also actively plotting intervention conspiracies against Laos. According to a United Press International dispatch on June 5, Washington officials have already been "predicting" that the situation in Laos "may lead to a serious international crisis," so "the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization may directly intervene." At the same time, Thailand and South Vietnam, under the direction of the United States, have intensified their activities to collude with the Lao authorities, and Saigon and Bangkok have also issued calls for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to intervene in Laos.
    The Lao authorities, regardless of the protests and warnings from relevant countries, and regardless of the condemnation and criticism from fair world opinion, are determined to place the fate of the Kingdom of Laos under the control of American imperialism, and are determined to move towards the road of expanding the civil war. This not only violates the national interests of the Lao people, but also violates the peace interests of the Indochina region and the entire Asia. The Lao authorities should see the serious consequences that will arise from acting willfully.

    老挝当局一意孤行
    本报评论员
    根据老挝王国政府和法国政府7月23日在万象发表的一项联合公报，老挝王国政府公然决定要使用美国供给的各种武器和军用物资，来训练“一支强大的军队”，并要求“美国军事专家给以帮助”。这是美国侵略势力和老挝反动派蓄意彻底破坏日内瓦协议、扩大老挝内战和威胁印度支那和平的一个最新的发展和证明。有关老挝的日内瓦协议明确规定，自宣布停火之时起，禁止一切增援部队和军事人员从境外进入老挝，法国军事人员只能在当时特定的地区留下一部分，至于美国军事人员根本就不得进入老挝境内。这就使老挝当局为自己背信弃义的行为所作的一切辩解和抵赖，都彻底破产，而美帝国主义插手干涉老挝内政的狰狞面目也更赤裸裸地暴露出来了。
    老挝当局和法国政府的联合公报是一个极其危险的信号。它表明了美国将要进一步对老挝的事务实行公开的干涉，加紧控制老挝王国的军队，以遂其最后攫取老挝的侵略野心。正如不久前印度“闪电”周刊所揭露，美帝国主义的目的“是粉碎老挝争取民主和独立的运动，镇压老挝人民走向和平和中立的倾向，并且把这个国家拉入东南亚条约组织。”早在今年2月间，在培·萨纳尼空声明不再受日内瓦协议约束以后的第二天，美国国务院便曾表示，美国从此可以自由地在老挝设立军事使团了。在这之后，老挝局势便迅速恶化，一直发展到5月下旬老挝王国政府军队向寮国战斗部队发动进攻，悍然挑起了内战，使老挝和平遭到破坏。这一切都是出于美帝国主义的阴险策划。事实上美国在唆使老挝当局发动内战，撕毁日内瓦协议之前，早就把大量的军事物资和武器弹药非法地运进老挝，大批的美国军事人员也以各种名目进入老挝。现在美帝国主义索性策动老挝当局公开要求美国军事人员“帮助”训练老挝军队，使美国干涉老挝内政和破坏日内瓦协议的勾当“合法化”。
    尤其值得注意的是，在老挝当局要求美国军事人员的“帮助”的同时，正在曼谷进行活动的老挝外交大臣班雅公然叫嚷东南亚条约组织和联合国将“保护”老挝。这当然不是偶然的。最近时期，美国操纵下的东南亚条约侵略集团也正在积极地策划对老挝的干涉阴谋。据6月5日合众国际社的电讯透露，华盛顿官方人士已经在“预言”老挝局势“可能会发生严重的国际危机”，因而
  “东南亚条约组织可能直接干预”。与此同时，泰国和南越在美国指使下加紧了勾结老挝当局的活动，西贡和曼谷也都发出了要由东南亚条约组织干涉老挝的叫嚣。
    老挝当局不顾有关各国的抗议和警告，不顾全世界公正舆论的谴责和批评，决心把老挝王国的命运置于美帝国主义的控制之下，决心走向扩大内战的道路。这不仅违背老挝人民的民族利益，也违背印度支那地区和整个亚洲的和平利益。老挝当局应当看到由于一意孤行而将产生的严重后果。
