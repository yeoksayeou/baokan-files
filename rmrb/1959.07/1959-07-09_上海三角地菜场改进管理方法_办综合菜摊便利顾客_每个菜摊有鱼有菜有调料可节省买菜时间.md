The Party branch of the Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market in Hongkou District, Shanghai, has strengthened the political and ideological education of the market staff, helped them establish the viewpoint of wholeheartedly serving the people, improved the market's supply work, and reduced the congestion of people queuing to buy vegetables.

The Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market is one of the largest vegetable markets in Shanghai, with more than 10,000 people coming to buy vegetables every day. This year, although the amount of vegetables on the market every day has increased a lot compared to the past, the queuing and congestion have not improved. Regarding this chaotic phenomenon, some market staff believed that "this is caused by the insufficient supply of non-staple foods."

Is the queuing phenomenon entirely caused by insufficient supply? In order to study and solve this problem, the Party branch of the Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market, with the help of the superior Party organization, decided to go deep into investigation and research. The branch first decided to change the office hours of the market cadres from 7:00 a.m. (when the market is about to close) to 5:00 a.m. (before the market opens) to work with the salespersons, deeply understand the problems in the supply work, and listen to consumers' opinions.

After the cadres went deep into the site, they found that the queuing congestion was not entirely caused by insufficient supply. For non-staple foods such as vegetables, which are in abundant supply, consumers still have to queue for a long time to buy them.

The layout of the stalls in the Sanjiaodi Vegetable Market is arranged in a classified and concentrated manner, which is the so-called "one-line" stall setting method. One row on the south side is all meat stalls, one row on the north side is all vegetable stalls, and fish stalls are concentrated in the center of the market. Consumers queue in a long line to buy meat and then rush to the north to queue for vegetables, buy fish and rush to buy meat, and the crowd squeezes around, and the order is very chaotic.

The comrades of the Party branch also saw another scene in front of the Women's Leap Forward Counter in this market. The Women's Leap Forward Counter was formed by 23 female salespersons during the March 8th Festival. The Leap Forward Counter includes meat stalls, fish stalls, vegetable stalls, etc., and is a comprehensive stall group. Consumers buy meat, and do not need to go around in a big circle, they can buy vegetables or fish nearby, reducing the time spent queuing and squeezing, and also reducing the chaos in the market. This gave the comrades of the Party branch a great inspiration: so they proposed to replace the one-line stall setting method with the comprehensive stall setting method.

Wang Fuzhou, the secretary of the Party branch, raised the issue of changing the stall setting method to the cadres above the group leader level of the entire vegetable market, and organized everyone to discuss it. During the discussion, some people were reluctant to dismantle the neat meat stall shelves; the cadres of the fish stalls were afraid that after the fish stalls were dispersed to various comprehensive stall groups, it would affect the fish processing work (such as scaling and grading). Most people believe that the one-line stall setting is convenient for management, and the comprehensive stall groups disrupt the stalls and professions, which will increase the trouble for assigning tasks, holding meetings, and accounting in the future.

Is it more important to serve the masses well, or is it more important to make management convenient for ourselves? The Party branch organized cadres to conduct "empty talk" on the above issues. After the "empty talk", everyone made it clear that improving the supply method and improving the quality of service is not only a specific business work, but also an important political and mass work.

At the cadre meeting, the salespersons of the Women's Leap Forward Counter specifically introduced their management methods, proving that comprehensive stall setting has many advantages in management compared to one-line stall setting. The main thing is that labor can be appropriately adjusted. In the past, meat stalls and vegetable stalls were separated. Meat stalls had less goods and ended business very early. After the salespersons washed the stall shelves, they had nothing to do. Vegetable stalls had more goods and more complicated varieties, and the salespersons were too busy. The phenomenon of consumers queuing and waiting to buy also increased. Comprehensive stall setting can unify the scheduling of manpower. When the meat is sold out, the salespersons who sell meat can help on the vegetable stalls, improving work efficiency and reducing the phenomenon of queuing and waiting to buy.

In this way, from the abstract to the concrete, the cadres reached a unified understanding in their thinking. The ideological awareness of cadres and salespersons has been improved, and their understanding is consistent. They immediately started to improve the stall setting method. The entire vegetable market formed twelve comprehensive stall groups, which were dispersed to various parts and corners of the market. Arrangements were also made for certain specific issues, such as the fish processing work, which was decentralized to each comprehensive stall group for contract processing. Within the comprehensive stall group, the labor force was unified and scheduled, giving full play to the potential of the labor force, and the supply points were expanded. The number of stalls increased from the original 71 to 161, and increased to 182 in June. Each comprehensive stall group has meat, fish, and vegetables, which is convenient for consumers and reduces queuing and congestion, which is welcomed by consumers. Some consumers' shopping time has been shortened from more than an hour to within half an hour, especially for consumers who have to rush to work in the factory in the morning, or who have children to take care of at home, are particularly satisfied with this improvement in the supply method.

After the success of the comprehensive stall setting, the Party branch and the vegetable market stall management committee further proposed a method of selling related non-staple foods, that is, next to the main non-staple food stalls, selling related seasonings and vegetables, such as onion and ginger next to fish stalls, onions and bamboo shoots for stir-fried meat slices and shredded meat next to meat stalls, and celery next to dried tofu stalls, so that residents can buy several kinds of non-staple foods at one time.

    上海三角地菜场改进管理方法
    办综合菜摊便利顾客
    每个菜摊有鱼有菜有调料可节省买菜时间
    本报讯　上海虹口区三角地菜场党支部加强了对菜场工作人员的政治思想教育，帮助菜场工作人员树立了全心全意为人民服务的观点，改进了菜场供应工作，减少了群众买菜排队的拥挤现象。
    三角地菜场是上海最大的菜场之一，每天到这里来买菜的有一万多人。今年来，菜场里每天上市的蔬菜量虽然比过去增加了很多，但排队和拥挤的现象并未改善。对此混乱现象，部分菜场工作人员认为：“这是副食品货源不足所造成的”。
    排队现象是否完全由货源不足引起的？为了研究和解决这个问题，三角地菜场党支部在上级党的帮助下，决心深入下去调查研究。支部首先决定改变菜场干部的办公时间，从原来早晨七时（这时菜场将要落市）开始办公改为从五时（菜场开市前）即到场办公，和营业员同劳动，深入了解供应工作中的问题，听取消费者的意见。
    干部深入现场以后，即发现排队拥挤现象并非完全由于货源不足而引起。像蔬菜等供应很充沛的副食品，消费者也要排很长的队才能买到。
    三角地菜场摊位的设置是分类集中排列的，就是所谓“一条鞭”的设摊方法。靠南面一排全部是肉摊，靠北面一排全部是蔬菜摊，鱼摊集中在菜场中心。消费者排了长长的队买好了肉还要赶到北面去排队买蔬菜，买好了鱼还要赶去买肉，人群挤来挤去，秩序很混乱。
    党支部的同志在这个场的妇女跃进柜前也看到了另一种景象。妇女跃进柜是三八节时由二十三个妇女营业员组成，跃进柜包括了肉摊、鱼摊、菜摊等，是一个综合摊组。消费者买了肉，不需要兜很大圈子，可以就近买到菜或鱼，减少了排队和挤来挤去的时间，也减轻了菜场的混乱。这给党支部的同志很大启发：于是就提出了用综合设摊的方法来代替一条鞭的设摊方法。
    党支部书记王福洲把改变摊位设置方法的问题提到全菜场小组长以上干部面前，组织大家讨论，讨论中有的人不舍得把整齐的肉摊架子拆散；鱼摊的干部怕鱼摊分散到各个综合摊组后，会影响鱼的加工工作（如刮鳞、分档等）。而多数人认为一条鞭设摊管理方便，综合摊组打乱了摊位和专业，以后布置任务，开会、算账，就增加了麻烦。
    到底是为群众服务得好重要，还是自己管理方便重要？党支部针对以上问题组织干部务虚。经过务虚，大家明确了：改进供应方法，提高服务质量，不仅仅是一个具体业务工作，而且也是一项重要的政治工作和群众工作。
    在干部会上，妇女跃进柜的营业员又具体介绍了她们的管理方法，证明了综合设摊比一条鞭设摊在管理上有许多好处。主要是劳动力可以适当调剂，过去肉摊和菜摊分开，肉摊货少，很早结束营业，营业员洗净摊架后就无事可干了。蔬菜摊货源多，品种又较复杂，营业员忙不过来，消费者排队等购的现象也就增加了。综合设摊，可以统一调度人力，肉卖完了，卖肉的营业员就到菜摊上帮忙，提高了工作效率，减轻了排队等购现象。
    这样，从虚到实，干部思想上取得了统一的认识。干部和营业员的思想觉悟提高了，认识一致了，他们便立即着手改进摊位设置方法。全菜场组成了十二个综合摊组，分散到菜场各个部分和各个角落。对某些具体问题也作了安排，如鱼类的加工工作便分散到各综合摊组去包干处理。在综合摊组内，劳动力统一调度，发挥了劳动力的潜力，供应点便扩大了。摊位从原来的七十一个扩大到一百六十一个，6月份便增加到一百八十二个。每一综合摊组内有肉有鱼也有菜，便利了消费者，减轻了排队和拥挤现象，受到了消费者的欢迎。有的消费者买菜的时间便从一个多小时缩短到半小时以内，特别是早上要赶到工厂上班，或家里有小孩要照顾的消费者，对供应方法上这一改进，尤其满意。
    在综合设摊成功以后，党支部和菜场摊贩管理委员会又进一步提出卖连带副食品的办法，即在主要副食品摊的旁边，附卖有关的调味品和蔬菜，如鱼摊附卖葱、姜，肉摊附卖供炒肉片、炒肉丝用的洋葱，茭白，豆腐干摊附卖芹菜等，使居民一次买到几样副食品。（附图片）
