Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: To commemorate the 15th anniversary of Poland's National Rebirth Day on July 22nd, the Polish Ambassador to China, Kiryluk, held a press conference today to introduce the situation of the People's Republic of Poland to the capital's press.

Ambassador Kiryluk said that today, Poland is a powerful country because it has a strong economic force and because it belongs to the socialist camp. In his speech, Kiryluk emphasized Poland's contribution to the struggle for world peace and against aggression.

The Ambassador pointed out that in the past fifteen years, not only has the industry and agriculture of People's Poland achieved vigorous development, but also there have been rapid developments in science, culture, education, and various social welfare undertakings. These great achievements are all attributed to the wise leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and the selfless labor of the entire people. Our party is stronger and more united than ever before. These great achievements should also be attributed to the assistance and cooperation of socialist camp countries, especially the fraternal cooperation between us and the powerful Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's assistance and cooperation are the cornerstone of the economic achievements of People's Poland.

Ambassador Kiryluk also said that the Polish people cherish the friendship between Poland and China very much. Socialism is our common goal, and Marxism-Leninism is our common ideological foundation. This determines the fraternal and invincible unity between Poland and China, and determines the unity of our entire socialist camp.

A total of more than twenty people attended the reception.

    介绍波兰十五年来的建设成就
    新华社18日讯　7月22日是波兰国家复兴节十五周年纪念日，波兰驻中国大使基里洛克在今天举行记者招待会，向首都新闻界介绍波兰人民共和国的情况。
    基里洛克大使说，今天，波兰已是一个强大的国家，因为它具有强大的经济力量，因为它属于社会主义阵营。基里洛克在谈话中强调指出波兰在争取世界和平，反对侵略的斗争中所作出的贡献。
    大使指出，在十五年中，不仅人民波兰的工、农业获得了生气勃勃的发展，而且在科学、文化、教育和各种各样的社会福利事业方面都有了飞跃的发展。这些伟大的成就都归功于波兰统一工人党的英明领导和全体人民的忘我劳动，我们的党比以前任何时候都更加强大和更加团结了。这些伟大的成就也应该归功于社会主义阵营各国的帮助和合作，首先是归功于我们和强大的苏联的兄弟般的合作，苏联的帮助和合作是人民波兰的经济成就的奠基石。
    基里洛克大使又说，波兰人民十分珍视波中友谊。社会主义是我们共同的目标，马克思列宁主义是我们共同的思想基础。这就决定了我们兄弟般的、不可战胜的波中两国的团结一致，决定了我们整个社会主义阵营的团结一致。
