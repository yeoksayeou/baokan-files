Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 20th - The headquarters of the Fifth Military District of Havana announced on the 19th that the army had arrested Agustin Diaz, a leader of the reactionary organization "White Rose" in Havana, and a group of conspirators.

Diaz was the leader of these conspirators, who had formulated a plan to overthrow the current regime by violence under the leadership of the Batista counter-revolutionary organization "White Rose." They acted according to instructions issued from Miami, USA by the major war criminal Masferrer and other war criminals supported by the United States, and received weapons, uniforms, portable radios, and bombs from there. The arrested conspirators confessed that they planned to poison the water in the aqueducts, blow up armories, and attack barracks, with the aim of creating chaos and terror among the masses and creating an atmosphere for foreign enemies to invade Cuba.

At the same time, on the 18th, the revolutionary army arrested twenty-five conspirators in Mariano, a city not far from Havana.

The Cuban Chefs Association Congress, currently being held in the capital, passed a resolution calling for the organization and training of workers' militias to cooperate with the army in defending national sovereignty when the motherland is invaded. The Congress also decided to donate one day's wages to land reform.
