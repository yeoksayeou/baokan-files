    Resolution of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia on Agriculture at the 11th Congress
    The 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was held in Prague from June 18 to 21, 1958. The resolution on agricultural development adopted at the meeting pointed out that the task facing Czechoslovakia in agricultural production is: to use all potentials to reach the level of the most developed capitalist countries in terms of unit area yield and agricultural labor productivity in a short period. The meeting put forward the guidelines and goals for future agricultural development: to establish a highly mechanized, widely used chemical fertilizer, high unit area yield modern socialist agriculture; by 1965, agricultural production should increase by about 40% compared with 1957, agricultural labor productivity should be increased by about one time, and the socialist transformation of agriculture nationwide should be basically completed by next year (1960) at the latest. In order to do this, the resolution requires that by 1965, 100,000 new tractors and a large number of machines for mechanizing livestock production be provided to agriculture, and that the production of chemical fertilizers be increased to two and a half times that of 1957. In addition, the resolution also requires attention to strengthening and developing agricultural cooperatives, and fundamentally improving the work of state farms. (Bai)

    捷共十一大关于农业的决议
    1958年6月18日至21日，捷克斯洛伐克共产党在布拉格举行了第十一次代表大会。会议就农业发展问题作出的决议指出，捷克斯洛伐克在农业生产方面所面临的任务是：要利用一切潜力以便在短时期内在农业生产的单位面积产量方面和农业劳动生产率方面达到最发达的资本主义国家的水平。会议提出了今后农业发展的方针和目标是：建立高度机械化的、广泛使用化学肥料的、单位面积产量高的现代化社会主义农业；到1965年，农业生产要比1957年增长约40％，农业劳动生产率要提高大约一倍，并且至迟到明年（1960年）要基本上完成全国农业的社会主义改造。为了作到这一点，决议要求到1965年向农业提供十万台新的拖拉机和大量使畜牧业生产机械化的机器，要求使化学肥料的产量增加为1957年的两倍半。此外，决议还要求注意加强和发展农业合作社，并从根本上改进国营农场的工作。（白）
