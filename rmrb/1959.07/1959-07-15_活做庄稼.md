Farming Actively
Our Correspondent

Weijiayuan, the village that produced the "Wheat King" last year, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this summer. The Secretary of the Jishan County Party Committee told our reporter, "The wheat yield in this management district has been increasing linearly for five consecutive years. During the Great Leap Forward last year, it grew significantly; this year, with communization, it has leaped forward dramatically again. Over five years, the total output has doubled, with a per-mu yield expected to exceed 400 catties, more than double the county's average per-mu yield. The banner for wheat bumper harvests in the entire county will likely be planted here again."

With the yield of the Great Leap Forward comes the experience of the Great Leap Forward. We wanted to see the grand scene of the bumper harvest and, even more so, to hear about the experiences behind it. With these hopes, we accompanied comrades from the County Party Committee to Weijiayuan.

Considering Conditions, Emphasizing Democracy

Weijiayuan is a management district within the Fancun Commune of Jishan County, Shanxi Province. Backed by Mount Zihua and overlooking the Fen River, it is located on a high loess plateau, and its natural conditions are not particularly good. Here, trees crisscross and are scattered among the fields, and the vestiges of the small-peasant economy still restrict the improvement of farming conditions. When we arrived, the wheat had already been harvested, and interplanted and stubble-planted corn were growing vigorously on the land that had just been harvested. It was evident what efforts the peasants after communization were making to improve land utilization!

At the hottest time of noon, we entered the village. The streets were deserted, but the threshing grounds were bustling. Stacks of wheat stretched like mountains and ridges, clustered around the wide courtyards. Men and women commune members were busy threshing, winnowing, and bagging, and the shouts to the livestock, the whirring of hand-cranked winnowers, and the joyful laughter celebrating the harvest were woven into a moving melody. Attracted by this scene, the reporter stopped at a threshing ground and began chatting with the commune members. A middle-aged man said humorously, "This year's wheat is truly both irritating and delightful: it's pleasing to the eye, growing especially well; harvesting is frustrating, hard to cut; the more you thresh, the more you get, making you want to laugh; transporting it is a chore, making you suffer. Comrades, tell me, should we be irritated!? Or should we laugh!?" The commune member's words made everyone in the yard burst into laughter. In fact, although saying that the more you thresh, the more you get, is a bit of an exaggeration, the stacks of wheat were indeed much more numerous than last year. Taking their fourth team as an example, they only had seventeen stacks of wheat last year, but this year they had as many as twenty-six, and even if they threshed at two locations with three sessions each day, they still couldn't keep up!

Guided by comrades from the County Party Committee, we found the management district director, Old Yuan, and the Party Branch Secretary, Old Wei. After discussing the bumper harvest, we naturally asked them to talk about their leadership experience. They were very modest, repeatedly emphasizing that the continuous increase in yield was due to the leadership of the higher authorities, to communization, to the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, and to the "Eight-Character Charter" (soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, close planting, protection, tool reform, field management). As for the leadership of the management district, they said, there was nothing special, simply "considering conditions, farming actively; emphasizing democracy, with everyone running the house."

What does "farming actively" mean? When answering our question, Branch Secretary Wei Chuangjia shared the following:

Adapting to Local Conditions

Last year, it was almost time to sow the wheat. Instructions from higher authorities stated that vigorously promoting close planting was a crucial key to increasing production. The commune members of Weijiayuan, especially the cadres, were keenly aware of this. They turned to the records of recent years, and the figures were as follows:

1955: 12 catties of seeds per mu, 226 catties yield per mu;
1956: 15 catties of seeds per mu, 254 catties yield per mu;
1957: 18 catties of seeds per mu, 264 catties yield per mu;
1958: Seed amount increased by a significant amount to 25 catties per mu, and the yield also leaped up, reaching 307 catties per mu.

"The more seeds, the higher the yield." Some young commune members and cadres concluded from the above figures: "We have excellent, irrigated land that doesn't rely on the heavens. We can sow 50, 60, or even 70 catties per mu." Older farmers strongly opposed this: "You young whippersnappers are just messing around. This year's wheat is already dense enough, and you still want to dump more seeds into the ground. If we listen to you, next year's wheat will grow like cow hair!" The cadres initially didn't know what to do – how much should they sow? They went to consult more people. Everyone said that close planting can indeed increase production, but we can't go too far; we still need to farm actively, and not make every field look the same. Based on everyone's advice, the management director drafted a "five considerations" close-planting plan: first, consider the soil thickness; second, consider the amount of fertilizer; third, consider the seed size; fourth, consider the sowing width; fifth, consider the sowing time. The plan stipulated changing the five-inch row spacing drill to a "four-four drill" (four-inch row spacing, four-inch sowing width); uniformly using "Bima No. 1" seeds, which have larger grains; and dividing the land into three categories: the best land would be sown with 40 catties, the next best with 35 catties, and the third-class land with 30 catties. Although the young and old had different ideas, the plan had absorbed various opinions, and so the sowing proceeded quietly according to the management district's figures.

"This is the mass line, this is vivid dialectics." We in the field couldn't help but exclaim: "With these two things, no wonder your yields increase every year!"

Adapting to the Times

The Branch Secretary smiled and continued to talk about deep plowing. They also handled this matter flexibly last year. This area is double-cropped in a year, planting wheat in the fall, and intercropping the wheat fields with autumn crops, so planting and harvesting are tightly squeezed together. When things get busy, there aren't enough people or animals, and they have to race against time, so in the past, the wheat fields were only plowed to a shallow depth of four or five inches before sowing. However, last year the higher authorities called for plowing no less than one foot deep before sowing. This was a contradiction. "Should we prioritize time? Should we prioritize deep plowing? Or should we prioritize both time and deep plowing?" The management district turned this matter over to the masses for discussion. The masses said: the "Eight-Character Charter" also needs to be flexible with the word "time"! We need to consider both ends. Besides, planting immediately after plowing, the soil isn't exposed to the sun, and deep plowing isn't necessarily good for stubble-planted wheat; as long as we plow deep, level, and fine, that's enough. After discussing and planning, the cadres felt that the masses were right and reported the reasons to the higher authorities. After obtaining the leadership's approval, they resolutely decided, except for plowing a few mu of experimental fields, to act according to their capabilities and organized the masses to work day and night, using double plows to plow seven or eight inches deep, ensuring fine plowing and harrowing, and sowing on time.

After talking about deep plowing in one breath, Comrade Wei Chuangjia said with deep feeling, "This is what Chairman Mao said, 'Handle affairs according to specific conditions, and be decisive!'"

Next, they introduced how they decided to advance the sowing date due to changes in seed performance. From this introduction, our inner feelings toward the spirit of deep investigation and active farming of the cadres and commune members of Weijiayuan became even more profound.

It turned out that the "Bima No. 1" seeds they were planting were a variety bred from a hybrid of "Biyu Wheat" and "Locust Wheat." "Biyu Wheat" is spring-sown, and "Locust Wheat" is winter-sown, so the hybrid is semi-spring type. It was introduced in 1953. The seed was pure, and scientific and technical cadres said that the sowing time should be late, around the Cold Dew solar term. The people of Weijiayuan believed in science and had been sowing late until 1956. However, last year two teams had significantly different yields solely due to different sowing times. The eighth team followed the old rules and didn't start sowing until seven days after the Autumn Equinox, with a per-mu yield of 346 catties; the seventh team sowed as soon as the Autumn Equinox passed and finished sowing in seven days, with a per-mu yield of 380 catties. This was a mystery, and the clever cadres of Weijiayuan firmly grasped this mystery. They finally figured out that the "Bima No. 1" had changed its characteristics after several years of planting – just like southerners going to the north, they are afraid of the cold in the first few years, but now they are used to it. Therefore, the management district decided to act actively, based on the changes in seed characteristics, to change the past practice of late sowing and uniformly advance the sowing to after the Autumn Equinox. They were so good at summarizing experience and so good at exploring natural laws that they had already—if we can say so—mastered science!

Debate on the Threshing Ground

After staying in Weijiayuan, we also heard an interesting debate among the commune members. The debate was sparked by the question of how much wheat should be harvested per mu? Based on the uniformity of stalks and the plumpness of ears as the wheat grew in the fields, the commune members had already calculated in their minds for a per-mu yield of 500 catties. However, the actual yield turned out to be more thinking and less harvesting, with an average yield of only 420 catties per mu.

As a result, those who thought that close planting was excessive spoke up. They said that if this year's wheat had been slightly sparser, the per-mu yield would definitely have been no less than 500 catties! They complained that sowing 40 catties of seeds per mu was unreasonable and said that sparse fields can't beat dense fields, and dense fields can't beat even fields.

The technicians also felt that the phenomenon of the actual yield being lower than the estimated yield was unexpected, but they thought the fault wasn't in close planting, but that "Bima No. 1" had degenerated. They gave the reasons: reduced disease resistance, with wheat generally suffering from jaundice; and the grains were not as full and plump as when they were introduced.

Since the two opinions didn't agree, the commune members compared evidence, debated, and argued. Some people insisted that the wheat suffered from jaundice and that the grains were thin all due to the word "too dense," arguing that being too dense causes mutual crowding and lack of ventilation, making it easy to attract disease; and being too dense means you rob from me and I snatch from you, so it's likely that you won't get enough to eat, resulting in thin kernels. The technicians and some other commune members countered by saying that with sufficient fertilizer and water, the situation of "everyone sharing a bowl of porridge" wouldn't occur.

The debate became more and more lively, and the examples given were more specific. We didn't understand the specific conditions of each piece of land, making it difficult to quickly discern the merits of each argument, so we left the threshing ground and returned to the management committee. It turned out that the cadres of the management committee were also discussing this matter.

Before we could speak, Branch Secretary Wei Chuangjia said, "Our management committee, just like the debate on the threshing ground, is looking for the shortcomings of wheat planting last year. Shortcomings are irretrievable losses for the past; for the coming year, they are the potential and direction for the Great Leap Forward."

The next day, the sparks of debate on the threshing ground were fanned and fueled by them, becoming a prairie fire of mass effort to find shortcomings, tap potential, and formulate leap-forward measures. At this time, we remembered Comrade Wei Chuangjia's experience of "everyone running the house"; we felt even more deeply that the future year of 1960 would also be a year of even greater leap forward.

    活做庄稼
    本报记者
    去年出过麦王的魏家院，今年夏季又获得了空前的大丰收。稷山县委书记告诉记者说：“这个管理区的小麦产量连续五年直线上升，大跃进的去年，狠长了一节子；今年公社化，又猛猛跃了一大步。五年算总账，产量翻了一番，亩产要上四百几十斤，高于全县平均单位亩产量一倍还多。全县小麦丰产红旗，大概又要插在这里了。”
    有大跃进的产量，就有大跃进的经验。我们想看看大丰收的盛况，更想听听大丰收的经验。抱着这样的希望，便相随县委的同志赶往魏家院。
  看条件，讲民主
    魏家院是山西稷山县樊村公社的一个管理区。它背靠紫华山，遥望汾水，属高垣台地，自然条件并不太好。这里，树木纵横，杂错田间，土地被划成许多小片，小农经济留下来的遗痕，依然限制着耕作条件的改善。我们到来的时候，麦子已收割完毕，套种和回茬玉茭又在刚刚收过小麦的土地上茁壮地生长起来。一看便知公社化后的农民，对于提高土地利用率，是在作着怎样的努力！
    炎热的中午，我们走进村庄。街道上冷冷清清，打麦场上却热闹异常。麦垛堆山接岭，一个紧挨一个，围在宽大的场院四周。场内男女社员正忙着碾打、扇风、装袋，?喝牲口声，手摇扇车声和喜庆丰收的笑声，交织成动人的乐曲。记者受这种情景的吸引，就在一个麦场上停住脚步，和社员们叙谈起来。一个中年人饶有风趣地说：“今年的小麦真叫人有恼有笑：看着喜人，长的特别好；收着发燥，割也割不了；越打越多，由不得要笑；运输费劲，又叫人受不了。同志，你们说该恼！？还是该笑！？”这个社员的话，逗得满场人哈哈大笑。其实，说越打越多虽然有点夸张，但麦垛的确比去年多了许多。就拿他们四队来说，去年只有十七个麦垛，今年就多到二十六个，即使每天分两处各打三场，还是打也打不退哇！
    经县委的同志引导，我们找见了管理区主任老袁和党支部书记老魏。谈过丰收之后，自然要请他们谈谈领导经验。他们非常谦虚，反复地强调，产量连年提高，归功于上级领导，归功于公社化，归功于群众的冲天干劲，归功于“八字宪法”。至于管理区的领导嘛，他们说，没有什么，只不过“看条件，活做庄稼；讲民主，众人当家。”
      “活做庄稼”的意思是什么呢？支书魏创家同志回答我们的发问时，谈了以下几件事。
      因地制宜
    去年，麦子快要下种了。上级指示说，大力推行密植，是增产的重要关键。对此，魏家院的社员，特别是干部，都颇有体会。他们翻开几年来的记载，数字是这样的：
    1955年亩播十二斤，亩产二百二十六斤；
    1956年亩播十五斤，亩产二百五十四斤；
    1957年亩播十八斤，亩产二百六十四斤；
    1958年亩播二十五斤，播种量增加了一节子，产量也猛跃了一下，亩产三百零七斤。
      “下籽越多产量越高。”有些年轻的社员和干部，从上面的数字得出结论说：“咱这尽是不靠天的好水地，一亩种五六十斤、七八十斤都可以。”上年纪的老农非常反对：“年轻娃娃家光胡闹，今年麦子已经够稠够好了，还想往地里倒籽哩，听上你们的话，看明年的麦子长不成牛毛！”干部开初也没个底，究竟该种多少好呢？他们去和更多的人商量。大家说，密植倒能增产，可不能冒得太远；还要活做庄稼，不能块块一个模样。照众人的话，管理主任拟出一个“五看”的密植方案：一看土壤厚薄，二看粪肥多少，三看籽粒大小，四看播幅宽窄，五看播期早晚。规定把五寸行距条播耧，改为“四四耧”（行距四寸，播幅四寸）；统用籽粒较大的碧蚂一号种子；土地分为三类，顶好的下籽四十斤，次好的下籽三十五斤，三等地下籽三十斤。这数字，年轻的、年老的心思虽还不尽相投，但方案已是吸收了多方面意见，也就不声不响的按管理区的数字下了种。
      “这就是群众路线，这就是生动的辩证法。”我们在场的人不禁叫好：“有了这两条，怪不得你们的产量年年提高！”
        因时制宜
    支书笑了笑，继续说到深耕。这件事，去年他们也曾灵活了一下。此地是一年两作，秋天种麦，麦田套秋，收种紧紧挤在一起。忙起来，人畜不够使唤，又要抢夺时间，所以以前麦地只浅耕四、五寸，就下种了。可是，去年上级号召非深耕一尺不种。这是一个矛盾。“是顾时间呢？是顾深翻呢？还是时间、深翻都顾？”管理区把这事交给群众讨论。群众说：“八字宪法”也得和“时”字变通变通哇！两头都得顾。况且，随翻就种，土晒不阳，回茬种麦，深翻不见得好，只要犁深、犁平、犁细就行。干部们谋划谋划，觉得群众说得对，向上陈述了理由，征得领导同意，除翻了少数几亩试验田外，其余均当机立断，量力而行，组织群众昼夜紧赶，用套犁深翻七八寸，做到细犁细耙，按时下种。
    魏创家同志一口气谈完深翻以后，感受颇深地说：“这就是应了毛主席说的，办事要看具体情况，要多谋善断！”
    往下，他们介绍了由于种子性能的变化，而决定提前播期的事情。从这段介绍中，我们内心里对于魏家院干部和社员，那种深钻细究，活做庄稼的精神，越发体会的深刻了。
    原来，这里种的“碧蚂一号”，是由“碧玉麦”和“蚂蚱麦”杂交培育的品种。“碧玉麦”是春种，“蚂蚱麦”是冬种，两者相交，即成半春性。1953年引进，种性纯，科学技术干部说，下种时间要晚，寒露前后为好。魏家院的人信科学，一直到1956年，都是迟下种。可是，去年有两个队，仅因播期不同，产量相当悬殊。八队还按老规矩，过了秋分后七天才插耧，亩产三百四十六斤；七队刚过秋分就种，七天种完，亩产三百八十斤。这是一个谜，这个谜被聪明的魏家院干部们紧紧抓住了。他们终于弄清楚，是由于“碧蚂一号”经过几年种植以后，种性起了变化——就像南方人到了北方一样，头几年怕冷，现在已经习惯了。于是管理区作出决定，要根据种性的变化，活做庄稼，改变过去晚种的办法，统一提前于秋分后即行播种。他们就是如此善于总结经验，如此善于探索自然规律，他们已经——如果可以这样说，掌握了科学！
  打麦场上的争论
    住在魏家院以后，我们还听了社员中一出有意思的辩论。辩论的起因是一亩小麦究竟该打多少？依
  小麦在地里生长的那种秆齐、穗肥
  的情况，社员们心里早打了亩产五百斤的算盘。可是实产结果，却是想的多，打的少，每亩只平均产了
  四百二十多斤。
    这样一来，那些认为密植过度的人就说话了。他们说，今年的小麦要稍稀点儿的话，亩产量怎么也下不了五百斤！他们埋怨一亩下籽
  四十斤不合理，他们说稀田打不过稠田，稠田打不过匀田。
    技术员们也觉得实产低于预估的现象，出乎意料之外，但以为错处不是出在密植，而是“碧蚂一号”退化了。他们举出的理由是：抗病力减弱，小麦普遍发生过黄疸病；籽粒也没有引进时那么饱满、肥实。
    两种意见不投，社员们就互相比证据，发议论，辩起来了。有的人坚持说小麦得黄疸病，籽粒瘦，都出在“太密”两字上，理由是太密了互相挤抗、不透风，容易招病；太密了你抢我夺，就很可能吃不饱，摧籽不圆。技术员和其它一些社员又以肥足水饱、不会发生“众人分吃一碗粥”的情况来分辩。
    越辩越热闹，举出的例证也更具体。我们不了解每块土地的具体情况，急切难于听出个长短，就离开打麦场，回到了管理委员会。正好管理委员会的干部们，也在议论这件事。
    不等我们开口，支书魏创家同志就说：“我们管委会，也和打麦场上的争论一样，在寻找去年种植小麦的缺点。缺点对过去来说，是不可弥补的损失；对下年来说，便是大跃进的潜力和方向。”
    第二天，打麦场上，辩论的星星之火，就被他们扇风助燃，成为群策群力找缺点挖潜力，订跃进措施的燎原大火。这时，我们想起了魏创家同志讲“众人当家”的经验；更深深地感到，未来的1960年，也将是个更大跃进的年头。
