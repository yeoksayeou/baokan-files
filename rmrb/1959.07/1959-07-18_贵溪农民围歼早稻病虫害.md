Guixi Farmers Encircle and Annihilate Early Rice Pests and Diseases

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, July 17th) The Guixi County, Jiangxi Province, urgently mobilized the masses to launch a concentrated campaign to encircle and annihilate late-stage insect pests on early rice, ensuring a bumper harvest.

Recently, due to the sharp rise in temperature after rain, rice stem borers, leafhoppers, and rice leaf rollers and other insect pests have occurred in large numbers and are spreading rapidly. According to preliminary statistics for the county, nearly one-quarter of the total area of early rice, approximately 71,000 mu, has been affected by insect pests to varying degrees.

The Guixi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an emergency county-wide telephone conference on pest extermination a few days ago, instructing all people's communes to stop or postpone other work that could be stopped or postponed, and immediately organize commune members to launch a concentrated campaign to encircle and annihilate early rice pests. Now, more than 20,000 people throughout the county have been投入了into the struggle to seize grain from the insect pests. Members of the Luohe Commune formed more than 100 pest extermination shock teams, putting forward the slogan "Exterminate every plot, vow to ensure a bumper harvest on every plot." They inspected the early rice fields plot by plot, removed the dead heart seedlings damaged by insects, and also universally sprayed 666 powder on more than 200 mu of late rice seedling fields near the severely infested early rice fields to prevent the spread of insect pests. 1,700 members of the Tangwan Commune worked hard for three days and three nights and have basically eliminated the insect pests.

After several days of fighting, the county has eliminated insect pests on more than 30,000 mu of early rice. The broad masses of commune members are determined to completely and thoroughly eliminate early rice pests at the fastest speed, and to do a good job in preventing insect pests in the late rice fields.

    贵溪农民围歼早稻病虫害
    本报南昌17日电　江西省贵溪县紧急动员群众，突击围歼早稻后期虫害，确保早稻丰收。
    近来，因雨后气温陡升，三化螟、浮尘子和稻苞虫等虫害大量发生，来势甚猛。根据全县初步统计，受到不同程度虫害的早稻将近总面积的四分之一，约七万一千亩。
    中共贵溪县委于前几天召开了全县灭虫紧急电话会议，指示各人民公社，把其他工作能停的停、能缓的缓，立即组织社员突击围歼早稻虫害。现在全县已先后有两万多人投入了与虫害争粮的斗争。罗河公社社员组成一百多个灭虫突击队，提出“有一丘灭一丘，誓要丘丘保丰收”的口号，对早稻田逐丘逐块检查，拔除被虫危害的枯心苗，对靠近虫害严重的早稻田的二百余亩晚稻秧田，还普遍喷撒了一次六六六粉，以防止虫害蔓延。塘湾公社一千七百名社员奋力苦战三天三夜，已经基本上消灭了虫害。
    全县经过几天战斗，已经消灭了早稻虫害三万多亩。广大社员决心以最快的速度全部彻底地消灭早稻虫害，并作好晚稻田的防虫工作。　（马钟明）
