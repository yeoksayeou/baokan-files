    Red Flag Electric Shovel
    After Fushun Mining Bureau and Jingxi, Huainan, Fuxin, Kailuan and other mining bureaus challenged the national coal mines, they vigorously grasped high-quality, high-yield measures and paid attention to safety work. This is the No. 59 electric shovel of the stripping section of the West Open-pit Mine, which was awarded the title of Red Flag Team, busily loading trucks. In early July, this electric shovel overfulfilled its stripping task.

    红旗电铲
    抚顺矿务局在和京西、淮南、阜新、开滦等矿务局向全国煤矿提出挑战后，大抓优质、高产措施，并已注意安全工作。这是西露天矿剥离段曾获得红旗小组称号的59号电铲，正在紧张地装车。7月上旬这个电铲超额完成了剥离任务。
