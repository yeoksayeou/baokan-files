The "Threshold" of Opera Actors
	Hu Sha

	Recently, I have been fortunate to see many excerpts of Peking Opera, Kunqu Opera, Bangzi Opera, and Ping Opera, mostly the signature performances of these opera performing artists. What makes them signature performances? Mainly the performance "techniques." Ping Opera, being newer, has neither the quantity nor the quality of excerpts that the older styles have, which shows that "technique" is not simple; it is formed through years of accumulation and the meticulous creation of many senior artists.

	I only saw a few excerpt performances, but several of them featured young male characters as the finale, such as "Yellow Crane Tower," "Linjiang Meeting," and "Borrowing Zhao Yun," which immediately made me think of Xu Xiaoxiang, the famous young male actor of a hundred years ago, because he put a lot of effort into creating the artistic image of Zhou Yu. Some say, "Ten years to forge a sword," describing the depth of dedication. In opera performance, there are quite a few repertoires that have been refined for a hundred years. These performances are truly worthy of being called brilliant. "Refined" means few, and "brilliant" means beautiful. There is a rule in Chinese opera performance called "More is less." How can it be both few and good? That requires a high degree of skill.

	While watching the plays, I suddenly thought of Liu Chengji, the famous clown actor of Sichuan Opera. Sichuan Opera clowns are very famous, and Liu Chengji, in terms of skill, is the peak of them. Beijing audiences who have seen his performances of "Gifting the Silk Robe" and "Discussing Swords and Presenting Swords" all praised his skill. I remember once when Comrade Cheng Yanqiu watched him perform "Kneeling at the Door to Eat Grass" in "Gifting the Silk Robe," he couldn't help but praise him repeatedly during the performance. As soon as the performance ended, he immediately went backstage to shake hands with Liu Chengji. As Comrade Cheng Yanqiu, who had a high degree of performing skills himself, loved and respected the skills of the actors, because he knew that skills are not easy to come by.

	Afterwards, Mr. Liu Chengji told me that Sichuan Opera audiences regard "Gifting the Silk Robe" and "Discussing Swords and Presenting Swords" as the "thresholds" for clown actors. "If you can't jump over these two thresholds, you can't be considered a good clown." To jump over this threshold, Teacher Liu has been working hard at it since he was a child, so he reached a very high level.

	I think the word "threshold" is used very well. It is like a high jumper, with a highest standard set there, for the younger generation of actors to jump over. After hard training, the younger generation of actors masters the performance skills of their predecessors, and only then can they jump over it. After jumping over it, they may raise the "threshold" a little higher and set up new "thresholds." In fact, our opera performance skills have developed in this way. For example, Comrade Mei Lanfang has set up many thresholds for the younger generation, such as "Drunken Beauty" and "Farewell My Concubine," and it seems that no one has been able to jump over them yet.

	Young opera actors, no matter what role they play—male, female, painted-face, old male, or clown—all have their own "thresholds," which can also be called "skill barriers," and they must strive to jump over this barrier. Only in this way can they be considered to have truly mastered the traditional performing techniques, and only then will it be possible to advance to higher artistic peaks.

	Due to the performance of excerpts, (although it has only just begun, and there are very few actors), the depth of skill and the beauty of art of our old artists are revealed.

	For example, Hou Xirui, Xun Huisheng, Li Hongchun, and Xiao Cuihua, seniors who rarely appear on stage, are also showing their skills. From this, we can also realize how much effort and labor our young opera actors need to spend, plus years of work, to jump over the "thresholds" set by these seniors.

### 戏曲演员的“门坎”

    戏曲演员的“门坎”胡沙
    近来真是眼福不浅，看了许多京戏、昆曲、梆子、评剧的折子戏，也多半是这些戏曲表演艺术家的拿手戏。什么地方拿手呢？主要在表演“技巧”上。评剧因为年头短，折子戏的量和质都不如那些老大哥，可见“技巧”这东西不简单，是经过长年累月和许多前辈艺人的精心创造形成的。
    我只看到几场折子戏，却有好几场是小生压轴，如“黄鹤楼”，“临江会”“借赵云”等，使我马上想到了一百年前的名小生徐小香，因为他为创造周瑜的艺术形象，是费过心血的。有人说：“十年磨一剑”，形容用功之深。戏曲表演中，经过一百年琢磨的剧目，不在少数。这种表演才真的称得起精彩。“精”就是少的意思，“彩”就是美的意思。中国戏曲表演上有一条法则，叫做“多不如少”，怎样才能又少又好呢，那就需要有高度的技巧。
    边看戏，我忽然想起了川剧名丑刘成基，川剧丑是很出名的，刘成基从技巧上说，又是其中的高峰。北京人看过他的表演“赠绨袍”和“议剑献剑”，对他的技巧莫不赞扬。记得有一次程砚秋同志看他表演“赠绨袍”中的“跪门吃草”，他表演时，砚秋同志就忍不住连声夸奖，戏一闭幕，他马上到后台和刘成基握手。作为有高度表演技巧的程砚秋同志，他热爱和尊重演员的技巧，因为他知道技巧得来不易。
    事后，刘成基老先生告诉我，川剧观众将“赠绨袍”和“议剑献剑”当作丑角的“门坎”，“跳不过这两道门坎，算不得好丑角。”为了跳过这个门坎，刘老师从年幼时起，就一直对它下功夫，所以达到了很高的水平。
    我觉得“门坎”这两个字用得很妙。他好比运动员跳高，有一个最高标准摆在那里，让后辈演员去跳，后辈演员经过刻苦磨练，掌握了前辈的表演技巧，才能跳得过，跳过之后，他可能又把那“门坎”提高些，并设立新的“门坎”。我们的戏曲表演技巧，事实上就是这样发展过来的。如梅兰芳同志，又为后辈设立了许多门坎，如“醉酒”，“别姬”等，好像至今还没有人能跳得过去。
    青年的戏曲演员，不管生、旦、净、末、丑各行各业，都有自己的“门坎”，也可以叫做“技巧关”，必需要争取跳过这一关。只有这样，才能算是真正的掌握了传统的表演技术，也才有可能往更高的艺术高峰前进。
    由于折子戏的演出，（虽然只是才开始，演员也很少），却显出我们老艺术家们的功夫之深，艺术之美来了。
    如侯喜瑞、荀慧生、李洪春、筱翠花等不大常登台的前辈，也各显其技。从这里也使我们体会到，我们的年青戏曲演员要费多大的心血、劳动，再加上年月才能将这些前辈所设的“门坎”跳过。
