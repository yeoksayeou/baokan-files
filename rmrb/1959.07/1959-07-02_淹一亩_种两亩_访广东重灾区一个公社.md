　　Drown One Mu, Plant Two Mu
　　——Visiting a Commune in a Heavily Afflicted Area of Guangdong
　　By our reporter Chen Yi

Leaving Huizhou County town and walking along the shore of the East River, you arrive at the Huihuan People's Commune. This commune was one of the hardest hit areas in this extraordinary flood. On my way to the Dongping Production Brigade, I saw that the floodwaters in some of the farmland had not completely receded, and almost all the crops had been destroyed by the flood. Some rice stalks were lying flat in the water or mud. All the houses in the village, even those on higher ground, had watermarks on their walls.

　　Normal life has been restored
But the flood was finally overcome, and normal production and life have been restored. Some commune members are carefully cutting off the ears of rice one by one in the fields, trying to minimize the losses from the flood. More people are busy sowing, plowing, leveling the land, planting vegetables, and planting sweet potatoes. No matter which village you approach, you will see small groups of piglets and ducks and chickens foraging on the edge of the village. The threshing grounds and the areas in front of each house are filled with wardrobes, wooden boxes, tables, chairs, and jars. Clothes, cotton quilts, and straw mats are hung on crisscrossing bamboo poles; all of these things had been submerged by the flood.

"Can we recover the year's harvest in the late rice crop?" The answer I got to this question was almost always affirmative. Near Zhaiwu Village and Liangwu Village, a group of female commune members picking grains from rice straw piles told me many conditions that would guarantee a bumper late rice harvest. They believe that the late rice crop has started early this year, with a long growing period and plenty of fertilizer. With intensive cultivation and hard work, a yield of 1,000 catties of rice per mu is possible. A woman named Chen Jiao even stood up and pointed to the layer of silt brought by the flood on the field in front of her and said to me: "Every field has two or three inches of good fertilizer like this, plus fertilization, how can we not have a bumper harvest in the late rice crop!"

　　Taking the Road of "Production for Self-Salvation"
In several villages, I heard commune members say more than once: With the Communist Party as our backing and the People's Commune opening up a broad road, as long as we work hard, we don't have to fear natural disasters blocking our way! Yes, the masses have great confidence and energy in production for self-salvation.

In a room in the Xia Kuo Production Brigade, I saw many small ducks with unfledged feathers, enclosed on the ground by four grain enclosures. Many commune members were carrying bamboo baskets, squatting there to select ducklings. Commune members only needed to have their names recorded by Deputy Brigade Leader Lin Yingdeng, without paying a single cent in cash, and then they happily took the ducklings home to raise. It turned out that the commune and various production brigades are vigorously helping production teams and commune members develop household sideline occupations to increase their income. More than 500 ducks and geese in this brigade were rescued from the flood by cadres; after the water receded, 400 ducklings had already hatched. Luo Caili, a poor peasant with a family of seven, was rescued from the flood by the People's Liberation Army this time. He borrowed 30 ducklings from the commune and immediately turned out his old fishing nets to repair them, preparing to use the gaps to catch some small fish and shrimp to feed them. He counted on his fingers and told me: "In another seventy days, thirty ducks will weigh at least sixty catties. After deducting the cost of the ducklings returned to the commune, I will have at least thirty yuan in income!" Like Luo Caili, poor and lower-middle peasant commune members who had starved and fled famine due to water disasters before liberation have been very confident these days when talking about ways to save themselves through production and rebuild their homes. They say that one day of hard work will bring three days of sustenance. We must act quickly, work harder, and restore production as soon as possible.

As soon as the flood receded, Chen Jin-yan, the Xia Kuo Brigade production captain, and several commune members checked the late rice seedlings that had been drowned and immediately soaked rice seeds that day and began replanting the next day. All 136 mu of late rice in the team have now been replanted. More than 10,000 commune members from the eight production brigades in the entire commune are rushing to sow, plant, repair water conservancy facilities, accumulate large amounts of fertilizer, and vigorously engage in sideline production. The Seven-Linked Production Brigade caught more than 4,000 catties of fish in two days, which is more than the sideline income of the past month.

　　Difficulties can be overcome
The Huihuan Commune encountered great difficulties in both production and life in this extraordinary flood. In order to replant the land where the crops were drowned, there was a shortage of nearly 100,000 catties of rice seeds and vegetable seeds. However, thanks to the efforts of many cadres who risked their lives to rescue some of the seeds in the flood, and with the support of other communes, the difficulty of seed shortage was solved; now some commune members are also being sent to other places to find vegetable and miscellaneous grain seeds, and all seed problems will soon be resolved. Commune members with better and more houses are vacating space to allow commune members whose houses have collapsed to live temporarily. Nearby factories, schools, agencies, and troops have also vacated many houses for homeless commune members, allowing them to concentrate on production. The First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee told me that each production brigade has organized a construction team to specifically repair dangerous houses for commune members. As soon as the autumn harvest is over, a new batch of houses will be built for the disaster-stricken commune members.

From the many conversations with the Party Committee secretaries at all levels of the commune, production captains, and poor and lower-middle peasant commune members, I deeply believe that they are fully capable of overcoming temporary difficulties and achieving a bumper late rice harvest. They told me that planting 1,000 mu of sorghum, corn, foxtail millet and other early-maturing crops will yield a harvest in seventy to eighty days; vegetables can be eaten in just twenty days. Although most of the more than 4,000 mu of early rice in the entire commune were destroyed, the planned planting area for late rice has been expanded to more than 11,000 mu. "Drown one mu, plant two mu," this is the oath made by the cadres and commune members of the Huihuan Commune, and I have heard it in every village.

    淹一亩　种两亩
    ——访广东重灾区一个公社
    本报记者　陈逸
    出惠阳县城沿东江岸走去，便到了惠环人民公社。这个公社是这次特大洪水中的一个重灾区。在我到东平生产大队的路上，看到有些农田里洪水还没有完全消退，农作物几乎全被洪水淹坏了，一些稻子倒贴在水中或泥泞里。村里所有的房屋，连地势最高的房屋，墙上也留下一条条水淹过的痕迹。
            正常的生活恢复了
    但是，洪水终于抗过去了，正常的生产和生活也已恢复了。一些社员正在田里细心地把稻穗子一一割下来，尽量减少水灾的损失。更多的人们在忙着播种、犁田、整地、种菜、种蕃薯。不论走近哪个村庄，一眼便见到小群的小猪和鸡鸭在村边觅食。在打谷场和各家屋门前摆满了衣柜、木箱、桌椅和坛坛罐罐。纵横交叉的竹竿上晾晒着衣服、棉被和草席，这些东西都被洪水淹过。
    “能不能在晚造中把全年收成夺回来？”对这个问题，我所得的回答几乎都是肯定的。在翟屋村和梁屋村附近，一群在稻秆堆中拣谷子的女社员就跟我说了好些保证晚造大丰收的条件。她们认为，如今晚造开早了，生长时间长，肥料多，加上精耕细作，加劲干下去，亩产千斤谷子是可能的。一个名叫陈娇的妇女，还特地站起来指着前面田地上由洪水带来的那层淤泥对我说：“块块田都有这么两三寸厚的好肥料啦，再加上施肥，晚造还不会来个大丰收！”
            走“生产自救”的路
    在好几个村庄，我不止一次地听到社员这样说：有共产党撑腰板，又有人民公社开出条大路，只要双手勤，还怕天灾横祸阻住去路！是的，群众对生产自救的信心很足，劲头很大。
    在厦廓生产大队的一间房里，我看到羽毛未丰的许多小鸭，被四个谷围圈在地上。好些社员挽着竹筐子，蹲在那儿挑选小鸭。社员只叫副大队长林应登给记个名字，一分现钱也不付，便笑嘻嘻地把小鸭带回家去喂养了。原来，公社和各个生产大队正在大力帮助生产队和社员发展家庭副业，让社员增加收入。这个大队五百多只母鸭、母鹅都是干部从洪水中抢救出来的；水退后已孵出四百只小鸭了。贫农罗才利一家七口，这次被解放军从洪水中救出来，他从公社贷了三十只小鸭回家，就立刻翻出旧渔网修补，准备利用空隙捕些小鱼虾来喂养。他叠起指头告诉我：“再过七十天，三十只鸭子少说有六十斤，除掉交还公社的鸭苗本钱，起码也有三十多块钱收入哩！”像罗才利这样在解放前因水灾害得挨过饿、逃过荒的贫农和下中农社员，这些天来一谈起生产自救、重建家园的办法，都是很有信心。他们说，一日勤劳三日饱，一定要快动手，多干活，早点恢复生产。
    洪水刚刚退下去，厦廓大队生产队长陈锦炎和几个社员检查过被淹死的晚稻秧苗后，当天就浸下了谷种，次日即开始补播。全队一百三十六亩晚稻，现在都已补播完毕。全公社八个生产大队一万多名社员，正在抢播、抢种、抢修水利，大量积肥和大搞副业生产。七联生产大队两天内捕鱼四千余斤，比过去一个月的副业收入还要多。
              困难是可以克服的
    惠环公社遭遇这次特大水灾，无论在生产上或生活上都碰到了很大的困难。要把被淹掉作物的土地重新种上，谷种、菜种两项欠缺近十万斤。可是，由于许多干部在洪水中冒险把种子抢救出一部分，又得到别的公社的支援，欠缺谷种的困难就解决了；现在又派出一些社员到外地去找蔬菜和杂粮种子，全部种子问题不久也可以解决。房子较好较多的社员，腾出地方来让房屋倒塌的社员暂时居住。附近的工厂、学校、机关和部队也给无家可归的社员腾出不少房子，让他们安心生产。公社党委第一书记告诉我，各个生产大队都组织了一个建筑队，专门替社员修补危房。一待秋收后，即开始给受灾社员新建一批房舍。
    从公社各级党委书记、生产队长和贫农、下中农社员的多次谈话中，我深深相信他们完全能够克服暂时困难，夺取晚造特大丰收。他们告诉我；种上一千亩高粱、玉米、狗尾粟等早熟作物，过七八十天就有收成；蔬菜种下，只要二十来天便能吃了。全公社四千多亩早稻虽然绝大部分淹坏了，但是晚稻计划种植面积已扩大到一万一千亩以上。“淹一亩，种两亩”，这是惠环公社的干部和社员发的誓言，我在各个村庄里都听到过。
