The Ili River Valley in Xinjiang has recently seen twenty-two small-scale hydro and hydroelectric power stations put into production. The power they provide is mainly used for processing agricultural and pastoral products such as grain threshing, flour milling, rice milling, oil pressing, cream making, and sawing wood. The equipment capacity of these power stations ranges from a maximum of 28 kilowatts to a minimum of 0.3 kilowatts.

After these hydro and hydroelectric power stations were put into production, they boosted local agricultural and pastoral production. In the past, when the Ala-Zai-Bo People's Commune in Xinyuan County used animal power to press oil, one person and one horse could only produce six to eight kilograms of oil in ten hours each day. Now, with the use of a hydro power station, they can produce sixty kilograms of oil per day.

    伊犁河谷电站多
    新疆伊犁河谷最近有二十二座小型水力、水电站投入生产。它们提供的动力，主要用来进行谷物脱粒、磨面、碾米、榨油、制奶油、锯木等农牧业产品加工。这些电站的设备容量，最大的是二十八瓩，最小的是零点三瓩。
    这些水力站和水电站投入生产后，推动了当地的农牧业生产。新源县阿拉在伯人民公社原来用畜力榨油时，每天一人一马十个小时只出油六公斤到八公斤，现在利用一座水力站，每天可以出油六十公斤。
