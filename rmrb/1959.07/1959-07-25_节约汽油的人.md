In the auditorium of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee, Wu Deyi was invited to introduce his experience in saving fuel to representatives of drivers from all over the city. The warm applause in the auditorium expressed the drivers' respect for this gas-saving expert and their praise for his valuable experience.

Wu Deyi, a probationary member of the Communist Party of China, is a third-grade automobile driver. Since April 1957, he has saved a large amount of gasoline for the country every month, and in the second quarter of this year, he has continuously lowered the national automobile fuel consumption record, becoming a red banner for saving fuel on the automobile transportation front.

Wu Deyi began to study fuel conservation in the autumn of 1956. At that time, he had only been working at the Wuhan Automobile Transportation Company for more than a month.

Before liberation, Wu Deyi worked as a handyman and pulled a rickshaw. When he first obtained his driver's license and took up the post of car driver, he was extremely excited. At the same time, the scenes of suffering he had endured in life quickly flashed through his mind. "The Party is cultivating me!" he thought to himself, and secretly made up his mind: "I must strive to complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party!"

The "198" car driven by Wu Deyi was an old 1939 Chevrolet. At first, it was not easy to drive: it would break down here or there. After the first month, he looked at the record: the average fuel consumption per 100 vehicle kilometers was 25.95 liters, which was 4.8 liters more than the company's stipulated quota at the time. He felt anxious and uncomfortable, and repeatedly blamed himself: Others only consume 22.47 liters of fuel when driving this car, why do I consume so much? From then on, he began to study fuel conservation. He tried to do it, month after month, half a year, and the fuel consumption was reduced, but it still did not fall below the company's quota of 21.15 liters. Later, he couldn't hold back and went to the party branch secretary and said shyly: "I can't do it! The fuel consumption is too high, how can I complete the task..."

"Don't worry!" the secretary comforted him, and encouraged him: "Think of ways from a technical point of view, and ask the master craftsmen for advice, and you will definitely be able to do it."

From then on, Wu Deyi went everywhere to learn from the master craftsmen. Master Fu Laihuan told him that removing the accelerator pump on the carburetor could save fuel, and after trying it, it really worked. He saw that Master Liu Huimin was saving fuel, so he ran to ask for advice and learned the method of blocking the fast-car oil nozzle of the carburetor. He went back to his car and tried to block the oil nozzle, but the car was not easy to start. He asked Master Liu again, and Master Liu smiled and said to him: "Blocking too many oil nozzles will affect the speed of the car, and too few will still waste fuel. You must block them appropriately and pay attention to operation. Don't be impatient, don't slam on the accelerator..." These words enlightened him, and he soon succeeded in the experiment. He also learned how to maintain the car from other drivers. By April 1957, Wu Deyi's fuel consumption had dropped significantly. He continued to humbly learn from the master craftsmen, and always kept the bits and pieces of experience in his mind. He paid attention to every exchange of experience and every guarantee measure posted on the wall. In 1958 alone, he saved 1,980.17 liters of gasoline.

At the end of February this year, Wu Deyi followed the general branch secretary to Tianjin to learn from Gao Huchen, a fuel-saving expert and driver of the Tianjin Automobile Transportation Company. During Wu Deyi's trip to Tianjin, some master craftsmen and young people at home who were not convinced by him said: "Wu Deyi is nothing great, but the car is better." Many people wanted to try his car to see if there was any secret. Four master craftsmen tried his car one after another. However, the result of the experiment was that the car did not listen to them. With the same amount of transportation as Wu Deyi, the same road surface and distance, the daily fuel consumption was one-third more than Wu Deyi's average fuel consumption. As a result, everyone was convinced: "There is indeed technology in this."

After Wu Deyi returned, the automobile transportation company sent technicians to help him summarize his experience; many drivers went out with him to learn from him. And Wu Deyi was even more diligent. From morning till night, whether before leaving the car, after returning to the car, or stopping midway for transportation, he always revolved around the car, either checking the circuit, oil circuit, and chassis lubrication, or cleaning the oil pump and air filter, and wiping the parts clean. He never slammed on the accelerator or drove fast, which was both safe and saved fuel. In this way, Wu Deyi saved gasoline for the country bit by bit from various meticulous operations.

    节约汽油的人
    本报记者　徐奔
    在武汉市人民委员会大礼堂里，吴德义应邀向全市司机代表介绍了节约用油的经验。大礼堂里热烈的掌声，表示了司机们对这个节约汽油能手的尊敬和对他的宝贵经验的赞扬。
    吴德义，中国共产党预备党员，三级汽车司机。从1957年4月以来，他月月为国家节约大量汽油，并且在今年第二季度连续三个月把全国汽车耗油量的纪录，压低又压低，成为汽车运输战线上的一面节约用油的红旗。
    吴德义开始研究节约用油是1956年秋天的事。那时候，他到武汉市汽车运输公司才工作了一个多月。
    解放以前，吴德义做杂工，拉人力车。当他刚拿到驾驶执照、走上汽车司机岗位的时候，简直兴奋极了。同时，那一幕幕受生活煎熬的镜头，也迅疾地在他脑海里闪过。“是党在培养我啊！”他这样想着，暗自下定决心：“一定要努力完成党交给的任务！”
    吴德义驾驶的“198”号车，是一部1939年出厂的老式雪佛兰。一开始，这家伙驾驶起来很不顺手：不是坏这儿，就是坏那儿。第一个月过去了，他一看记录：平均每百车公里耗油二十五点九五公升，比当时公司规定的定额超过四点八公升。他心里又着急，又难受，连连责怪着自己：别人驾驶这部车子，也只耗油二十二点四七公升，为什么我耗这么多呢？从这时起，他便开始研究节约用油。他试着干下去，一月，两月，半年，耗油量在减少，但是仍然没有降到公司定额二十一点一五公升以下。后来，他实在憋不住了，就到党总支书记那里，腼腆地说：“我不行！油料消耗大，怎么完得成任务……”
    “别着急！”书记安慰他，同时又鼓励说：“好好从技术上想法子，多向老师傅请教，就一定能行。”
    从此以后，吴德义便到处向老师傅们学习。傅来欢师傅告诉他，拿掉化油器上的加速泵能够节约油，一试，果然有效。他见刘惠民师傅用油节省，便跑去请教，又学到了堵塞化油器的快车油眼的办法。他回到自己的车上试着堵油眼，可是车子不好发动。再去问刘师傅，刘师傅笑了笑，对他说：“油眼堵得过多会影响车速，过少仍然费油，要堵得适当，还要注意操作。别性急，不要猛轰油门……”这些话给他开了窍，很快他也试验成功了。他还从别的司机那里学会了保养车子。到1957年4月，吴德义的油耗便大大下降了。他还继续虚心向老师傅学习，随时把点滴的经验记在心里。每次交流经验，每个墙头上贴的保证措施，他无不注意。1958年一年就节约汽油一千九百八十点一七公升。
    今年2月底，吴德义又跟着总支书记到天津向省油能手、天津市汽车运输公司司机高虎臣学习了经验。就在吴德义去天津期间，家里一些对他不服气的老师傅和小伙子们说：“吴德义没有什么了不起，不过车子好些。”不少人想试试他的车子，看看有什么秘诀。先后有四个老师傅试开了他的车子。可是试验结果，车子不听使唤，同吴德义相同的运输量，相同的路面和距离，每天耗油量就比吴德义的平均耗油量多三分之一。这一来，大家心服了：“这里面确有技术。”
    吴德义回来以后，汽车运输公司派了技术人员帮他总结经验；不少司机跟他一起出车，向他学习。而吴德义更加勤奋了。从早到晚，不管出车前，回车后，或是中途停车待运，总是围着车子转，不是检查电路、油路、底盘滑润情况，就是清洗油泵和空气滤清器，把机件擦洗得干干净净。他从来不猛轰油门，不大开快车，又安全，又节约了油。就这样，吴德义从各种细致的操作上，点点滴滴地为国家节省了汽油。
