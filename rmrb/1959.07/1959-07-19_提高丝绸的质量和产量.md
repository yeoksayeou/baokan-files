    Zhejiang is one of China's silk industry bases. Its output of silkworm cocoons, raw silk, and silk fabrics accounts for about one-third of the national total.

    Since the first quarter of this year, Zhejiang's silk industry has launched a mass technical innovation movement centered on high quality and high output, achieving leaps in both quality and output. In the first half of this year, the average grade of white filature silk increased by 0.02 grades compared to the same period last year, and the average first-class rate of silk fabrics reached over 95%, an increase of 2.74% compared to the same period last year. The total output value fulfilled 110.65% of the plan, the total output of white filature silk fulfilled 104.7% of the plan, and the total output of silk fabrics fulfilled 118.37% of the plan.

    The achievement of this result is primarily due to the fact that leading cadres of various silk factories, through study, have clearly recognized the importance of comprehensively implementing the general line of building socialism by going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results. At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, while carrying out inter-factory competitions centered on high quality and high output, many enterprises strengthened education for their employees based on the characteristics of silk products. This enabled the broad masses of workers to generally recognize that silk is a precious product, and that producing according to variety and according to plan, and improving the quality of silk, not only has economic significance, but also has political significance.

    While solving these ideological understanding problems, we also used facts to illustrate that high quality and high output are not contradictory. In the second half of last year, the silk factories in Hangzhou and Huzhou areas differed greatly in product quality: the first-class rate of silk fabrics in Huzhou silk factories consistently maintained a level of 99%, and the output exceeded the state plan, while the first-class rate of Hangzhou silk factories remained below 90% for a long time. We promptly seized this fact, established the Da Chang Silk Factory in Huzhou as a model for product quality first, and conducted extensive publicity to the broad masses of workers through various means such as meetings, newspapers, and radio broadcasts. Through learning from the experience of Huzhou Da Chang Silk Factory, the quality of silk fabrics in Hangzhou has been rising steadily since this year.

    Technical innovation, whether it is an improvement in operating methods and technological processes, or a change in product design and the economical substitution of raw materials, must be judged on whether it can achieve both high output and high-quality economic results, and no one-sided measures can be taken. At the end of last year, in order to generally improve the technical level of workers, we concentrated advanced workers from silk reeling factories throughout the province at Jiaxing China Silk Reeling Factory to carry out an advanced operation competition. Based on the principles of high output, high quality, and low consumption, we summarized a set of advanced operating experiences for silk reeling and re-reeling. Silk factories also used the same method to summarize four major advanced operating methods for Meili silk, brocade satin, etc. When innovating and promoting advanced equipment and devices, silk factories throughout the province also fully considered the effect of high quality and high output.

    To achieve high quality and high output, factory and enterprise leaders must establish a thorough and meticulous work style. They should not only look at the production figures on the reports, but should often go deep into the workshops to check the quality of the products, be good at consulting with the masses in case of problems, humbly and sincerely seek advice from experienced workers and technicians, and use the "three combinations" method to frequently study and solve the key problems of output and quality.

    To ensure high quality and high output, there must also be reasonable rules and regulations, which are indispensable for organizing normal production and ensuring production order. Since the first quarter of this year, many silk factories in Zhejiang Province have begun to pay attention to this work, establishing the rules and regulations that should be established according to the needs of production, and have achieved remarkable results.

    Under the correct leadership of the Party, Zhejiang's silk industry has achieved some success, but the level of enterprise management is still not as good as that of fraternal regions such as Shanghai and Jiangsu. At the same time, the product quality of some factories is not stable enough. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to go all out, deepen the movement to increase production and practice economy, and humbly learn from the advanced experience of the silk industry in fraternal regions, learn from others' strengths to make up for one's own weaknesses, in order to better complete this year's production plan.

### 提高丝绸的质量和产量

    提高丝绸的质量和产量
    浙江省轻工业厅丝绸管理局副局长　袁之平
    浙江是我国丝绸工业的基地之一，无论是蚕茧、丝、绸产量，都占全国总产量的三分之一左右。
    今年第一季度以来，浙江丝绸工业开展了以优质高产为中心的群众性的技术革新运动，质量产量双双跃进。今年上半年白厂丝平均等级比去年同期提高0.02级，绸缎正品率平均达到95％以上，比去年同期提高2.74％。总产值完成计划的110.65％，白厂丝总产量完成计划的104.7％，绸缎总产量完成计划的118.37％。
    这个成绩的获得，首先是由于各丝绸厂的领导干部通过学习，明确认识到全面贯彻多快好省的方针的重要意义。去年年底和今年年初，在开展以优质高产为中心的厂际竞赛的同时，许多企业根据丝绸产品的特点，加强了对职工的教育。使职工群众普遍认识到，丝绸是珍贵产品，按品种、按计划生产，提高丝绸质量，不仅具有经济意义，而且具有政治意义。
    在解决这些思想认识问题的时候，我们还用事实说明优质与高产并不矛盾。去年下半年，杭州市和湖州市两个地区的丝绸厂，产品质量一直相差悬殊：湖州市丝绸厂的绸缎正品率一贯保持在99％的水平，产量超额完成国家计划，而杭州市丝绸厂正品率却长期停留在90％以下。我们及时抓住了这个事实，树立了湖州达昌丝绸厂产品质量第一的标兵，并通过会议、报纸、广播等各种方式，向广大职工进行广泛的宣传。通过学习湖州达昌丝绸厂的经验，今年以来，杭州市的绸缎质量已节节上升。
    革新技术，不论是操作方法和工艺过程的改进，也不论是改变产品设计和原材料的节约代用，都要看是否能够取得既高产又优质的经济效果，决不能采取片面的措施。去年年底，为了普遍地提高工人技术水平，我们曾经集中了全省缫丝厂的先进工人在嘉兴中国缫丝一厂开展了比先进操作竞赛，根据高产优质低消耗的原则，总结出一套缫丝和复摇的先进操作经验。丝绸厂也运用了同样方法，总结出美丽绸、织锦缎等四大先进操作法。全省丝绸厂在革新和推广先进设备装置时，也充分考虑到优质高产的效果。
    要达到优质高产，工厂企业领导干部必须树立深入细致的作风。不能只看报表上的生产数字，而应该经常深入车间检查产品的质量情况，遇事善于同群众商量，虚心诚恳地向有经验的工人和技术人员求教，运用“三结合”的方法，经常研究解决产量和质量的关键问题。
    保证优质高产，还必须有合理的规章制度，这是组织正常生产，保证生产秩序所不可缺少的。今年第一季度以来，浙江省不少丝绸厂开始重视了这个工作，根据生产的需要，把应立的规章制度立了起来，并已取得显著成绩。
    浙江丝绸工业在党的正确领导下，虽然取得了一些成绩，但是企业管理水平还赶不上上海、江苏等兄弟地区，同时部分厂的产品质量还不够稳定。因此，必须继续鼓足干劲，深入开展增产节约运动，并虚心学习兄弟地区丝绸工业的先进经验，取人之长，补己之短，以便更好地完成今年的生产计划。
