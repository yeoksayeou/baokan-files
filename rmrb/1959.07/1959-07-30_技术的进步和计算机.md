    Technological Progress and Computers
    A. Dorodnitsyn
    Computational technology is increasingly becoming an important factor in ensuring rapid technological development. The calculation speed of modern high-speed electronic computers is thousands or even tens of thousands of times faster than that of skilled calculators using electric calculators—the most advanced technical tools just a decade ago.

    The characteristic of modern computers is not only the significant reduction in calculation time in terms of quantity but also the qualitatively different new role of calculation methods in scientific research and technical design.

    In outdated computing technology, the time factor severely limited the actual possibility of performing computational work. Therefore, in most scientific and technical fields, the objective processes being studied were always simplified, and often greatly simplified, when using calculation methods. Thus, in technical design, the calculation results were only used to make approximate estimates of the objective processes or sketches of the research object. Whether in scientific research or in the study of new technical problems, the solution of the main part of the problem was carried out using lengthy and costly experimental methods.

    With modern high-speed electronic computers, it is possible to make the most accurate estimates of all the factors that seriously affect the process under study or the design work, to some extent, using calculation methods. Therefore, a large part of the work that was previously completed using experimental methods in the process of demonstrating a topic can be solved using calculation methods. This greatly reduces the cost of researching new technical problems and, more importantly, greatly shortens the research time.

    When estimating the economy of computers, the following example can sometimes be used for discussion: if a computer is 20,000 times faster than a calculator, it can replace the work of 20,000 people. The total annual salary of 20,000 calculators is about 250 million rubles. The production cost of a computer (considering machine depreciation) is only about 2 million rubles. Obviously, a high-speed electronic computer can save about 250 million rubles per year. This kind of "accounting-style" calculation does not explain the essence of the problem.

    First of all, if a computer's calculation speed is 20,000 times faster than a calculator, it does not mean that 20,000 calculators can replace the computer. The characteristic of mathematical calculation is the continuity of operations, that is, each next step of the calculation can only begin after the previous step of the calculation is completed. Therefore, to answer a question, it can only be calculated by one calculator. Now, when studying new technology topics, it is often necessary to solve problems that require continuous machine calculation for about ten hours. Therefore, if calculators were to solve such problems, it would take more than ten years, and no matter how large the army of calculators is, it cannot shorten the calculation time.

    Secondly, the actual economic utility of using high-speed electronic computers does not lie in reducing the number of calculators, but in reducing the research time for new technology programs and reducing the experimental arrangement work for new objects. The characteristics of many modern technical equipment are their high dynamics and automation performance. Without sufficiently accurate calculations, exploring these devices empirically would consume a lot of resources. The accurate calculations obtained using computers in a relatively short period of time, such as one day and night, are enough to offset the entire value of the computer.

    The application of computers in new technology fields such as atomic energy mechanics, space navigation, and automation is of special significance. Without the widespread use of high-speed electronic computers, it is difficult to imagine how these technical fields could have developed. In outdated technical departments, such as thermal engineering, structural mechanics, and machine manufacturing, research and design methods were formed long before the advent of high-speed computers. Electronic computers are used less in these departments, which is more or less due to the conservative ideas of the staff in these departments, because they are accustomed to using outdated methods. However, here, the calculations of high-speed computers are becoming more and more widely developed, and they will inevitably produce great technical and economic effects.

    In structural mechanics and machine manufacturing, large safety factors are used in the design of various components and parts, sometimes reaching five to ten. This safety factor is rightly called the "coefficient of ignorance." They are caused in part by a lack of understanding of material properties and in part by the unreliability of structural stress calculations.

    Using high-speed computers, it is entirely possible to know the precise distribution of stresses in components. It is then possible to select the most reasonable form of these components, remove excess safety factors, thereby improving the reliability of the structure while saving materials. For the high-power turbines that are currently being designed, using electronic computers to calculate their components can yield very valuable results.

    For some national economic problems, the speed of calculation is an absolutely necessary condition for solving the problem. For example, predicting the weather using fluid dynamics methods requires a large number of calculations. This method is only meaningful if a large number of calculations can be completed in a short time (for example, when predicting the weather for a day and night, the calculation time should not exceed one to two hours). However, even the simplest short-term weather forecast calculation scheme currently used requires tens of days to calculate.

    The speed of calculation also plays a decisive role in calculating the flight path of a space rocket after it is launched, which is another clear example. Obviously, the calculation must "run ahead" of the rocket, otherwise the calculation is meaningless. If calculators were to perform the calculation, then the calculation of the orbit of a space rocket from the Earth to the Moon might not be completed until after the rocket has orbited the Sun once.

    Automatic control of production processes is a special department that utilizes electronic computers, which has significant national economic significance.

    Continuous-action computers (i.e., analog computers) are currently the most important type of computer in automatic control systems. Research in this aspect of control machines will, and should, be developed in the future. The widespread use of electronics in these machines will further multiply the capabilities of the machines. Applying discrete operation computers to automatic control systems will reveal even broader prospects.

    In automatic control systems, the basic function of the computer can be determined as follows: after the computer receives signals about the process to be controlled and external factors affecting the process, it calculates what state the control device should be in to make the process run well, and finally issues instructions to the control device.

    The relationship between the parameters describing external conditions and the progress of the program and the state of the control device can be various.

    If this relationship is described by an obvious relationship or a general system of differential equations, then the continuous-action computer is already able to complete its task well. At the same time, the more complex the relationship, the more complicated the computer becomes. For discrete computers, the characteristic curve of the relationship between the state of the control mechanism and the progress of the process is not of great significance, because this type of computer can in principle perform any mathematical and logical operations. The complication of the relationship only means that the calculation work time required to complete the instructions increases for them. In a certain automatic control system, the possibility of applying discrete computers depends on the relationship between the fast action of the machine and the speed of the process to be controlled.

    Therefore, whether for computers used for mathematical calculations or for computers used for control, the problem of fast operation is of great significance. It plays a decisive role in the development of computing technology.

    In some technical departments, labor productivity can be greatly improved through automation, and raw materials and power can be saved. This mainly refers to the chemical industry, petroleum processing industry, metallurgical industry, as well as railway transportation and power systems. In these industrial sectors, the main difficulty in automation is not in manufacturing computers, but in researching technological processes and making their "mathematical descriptions," that is, determining the mathematical relationship between the parameters of the technological process and the control process. This is the most important issue, and its resolution will open the way for the development of automation. When the mathematical relationship is known, the manufacture of computers is not too complicated in principle.

    Scientific ideas in automation and computing technology do not stop at the achievements that have been made. Now it is developing in the direction of enabling machines to "research" processes themselves and determine unknown mathematical relationships. Some basic principles have been researched, and machines can be manufactured using them that can automatically maintain the parameters in the process in the most favorable conditions even if the exact mathematical description of a certain technological process is not known. Here, it is only necessary to know which parameters have an impact on the process, and it is not necessary to know the magnitude of this impact in advance. In the end, it will be possible to manufacture a machine that, like a human, can gain experience in the engineering process and improve its work as experience accumulates. This is the so-called self-adjusting or self-learning machine. The role of modern electronic computers is like this: they can actually complete any "intellectual" actions that are unique to humans, as long as humans have recognized the logic of these actions.

    This characteristic of electronic computers has led some philosophers to the "conclusion" of equating humans and machines. And because completing the operations specified by humans with machines is generally faster and more perfect than doing it by humans, some people have even come to the conclusion that humans will become "slaves of machines" in the future. This argument is completely unfounded, because no matter how perfect the machine is, it always completes the tasks given to it by humans.

    The above-mentioned aspects of using electronic computers are far from including all their possibilities. Economic analysis and statistics, transportation scheduling, general information work (including serving readers in libraries), can all rely on electronic computers, or more precisely, on specialized computers (whose principles are the same as electronic computers) to be solved more effectively.

    The importance of computing technology to the development of our science and to our national economy was reflected in the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union formulated at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The output of computers will increase by 4.5 to 4.7 times by the end of the seven-year plan. In this way, the urgent needs of various scientific and technological departments for this intelligent machine—the servant of creative human wisdom—will be met.

    技术的进步和计算机
    阿·朵罗德尼钦
    计算技术日益成为保证技术迅速发展的重要因素。现代快速电子计算机的计算速度，比使用电动计算机——即在十年前还曾是最完善的技术工具——的熟练的计算员要快上几千倍、几万倍。
    现代计算机的特点不仅在于数量上大大地缩短了计算的时间，而是它使得计算方法在科学研究和技术设计中有了性质上与前不同的新的作用。　
    在陈旧的计算技术中，时间的因素使进行计算工作的实际可能性受到了极大的限制。所以在大多数的科学和技术领域里，采用计算的方法时，所研究的客观过程总是被简化了的，而且常常是大大简化了的。因此在进行技术设计时，计算的结果仅用来对研究对象的客观过程或草图作出近似的估计。无论在科学研究或是在研究新的技术问题时，问题主要部分的解决是利用长时间的、价值昂贵的试验方法来进行的。
    有了现代的快速电子计算机，在一定程度上就有可能用计算的方法，对那些严重影响所研究的过程或设计工作的全部因素，作出最精确的估计。所以，从前在对题目进行论证过程中用实验方法所完成的很大一部分工作，可能用计算的方法来解决。这就大大地减低了对新技术问题研究的费用，更重要的是极大地缩短了研究的时间。
    在估计计算机的经济性时，有时可用下面例子来讨论：若计算机比计算员的速度快二万倍，它就能代替二万人的工作，二万个计算员的年工资总计约为二亿五千万卢布。计算机的生产费用（考虑到机器的折旧）只要约二百万卢布就够了。显然，一部快速电子计算机每年能节省约二亿五千万卢布。这种“会计式”的算账还不能说明问题的本质。
    首先，如果计算机的计算速度比计算员要快二万倍，这并不是说二万个计算员能代替计算机。数学计算的特征是运算的连续性，即每下一步的计算只能在当上一步的计算结束之后才能开始。所以要解答一个问题，只能由一个计算员进行计算。现在，研究新技术课题时，常常要解决那些需要用机器连续计算十小时左右的问题。因而要计算员来解决这样的问题，那就需要十年以上的时间，无论怎样的计算员大军也不能缩短它的计算时间。
    其次，使用快速电子计算机在经济上的实际效用，并不在于减少了计算员的数量，而在于减少了新技术方案的研究时间，减少了对于新对象的实验安排工作，现代许多技术设备的特点是它们的高动力性和自动化性能。若没有足够精确的计算，从经验上来探讨这些设备就会消耗大量的资财。在比较短的时间里，如一昼夜，利用计算机所取得的精确计算而节约的资金就足以能抵偿计算机的全部价值。
    计算机在原子能力学、宇宙航行学、自动化等新技术领域里的运用，具有特殊的意义。如果没有快速电子计算机的广泛利用，就很难想像这些技术领域怎样才能得到发展。在陈旧的技术部门，如热力工程学、建筑力学、机器制造，其研究和设计的方法远在快速计算机出现前就已形成，电子计算机在这些部门里采用得比较少，这或多或少地是由于这些部门里工作人员的保守思想，因为他们已习惯于用陈旧的方法。但是在这里，快速计算机的计算正愈来愈广泛地展开，并且它们在技术上和经济上必将产生很大的效果。
    在建筑力学和机器制造中，设计各种构件与零件时，采用了很大的安全系数，有时达到五至十。这种安全系数被正确地称为“无知的系数”。它们产生的原因，一部分是由于对材料性质不了解，另一部分是由于结构应力计算的不可靠性。
    利用快速计算机完全有可能知道构件中应力分布的精确情况。于是就有可能选择这些构件的最合理的形式，除去多余的安全系数，从而在提高结构的可靠性的同时又节约了材料。对于现在正在设计的大功率涡轮机，用电子计算机来计算它们的构件，能得到十分有价值的结果。
    对于某些国民经济问题，计算的速度是解决问题的绝对必要的条件。例如，用流体动力学方法来预告天气，需要进行大量的计算，只有在短时间内能够完成大量计算的情况下，这个方法才有意义（比方说，预告一昼夜的天气时，计算时间不应超过一至二小时）。但是即使目前使用的最简单的短期天气预报计算方案也需要好几十天的时间来进行计算。
    发射宇宙火箭后计算它的飞行轨道时，计算的速度也起着决定性的作用，这又是一个鲜明的例子。很显然，必须使计算“跑在”火箭的前面，否则计算就没有意义。如果由计算员来进行计算，那么宇宙火箭从地球到月球的轨道的计算，或许要在火箭绕太阳转了一圈之后才能算好。
    生产过程的自动控制是利用电子计算机的一个特殊部门，它具有重大的国民经济意义。
    连续作用计算机（即模拟计算机）是目前自动控制系统中最主要的一种计算机。控制机器的这一方面的研究将要、而且应该在今后得到发展。电子学在这些机器上的广泛使用，更将使机器的能力成倍地增加。把不连续运算计算机应用于自动控制系统，则将揭露更为广阔的远景。
    在自动控制系统中，计算机的基本作用可以确定如下：计算机接受了关于要控制的过程和影响这过程的外来因素的信号后，就计算出来控制装置应处在什么样的状态，才能使这个过程很好地进行，最后则对控制装置发出指令。
    描述外部条件以及程序进行情况的参数同控制装置的状态之间的关系可以是各式各样的。
  如果这个关系是由明显的关系式或一般的微分方程系来描述，那末连续作用计算机就已经能够很好地完成自己的任务，同时，关系愈复杂，则计算机也愈复杂化。对于不连续计算机来说，控制机构的状态同过程进行状况之间的关系的特征曲线没有什么重大的意义，因为这种计算机原则上能完成任何数学运算和逻辑运算。关系的复杂化对它们来说仅意味着完成指令所需的计算工作时间增长。在一定的自动控制系统中，不连续计算机的应用的可能性，决定于机器的快速作用和要控制的过程的进行速度之间的关系。
    所以，无论对于数学计算用的计算机或是控制用的计算机来说，快速运算问题有着极大的意义。它对于计算技术的发展起决定性作用。
    在有些技术部门里，可以通过自动化而大大提高劳动生产率，并且节约原料和动力。这首先是指化学工业、石油加工工业、冶金工业以及铁路运输和电力系统。在这些工业部门中，自动化的主要困难不在于制造计算机，而在于工艺过程的研究和作出它们的“数学描述”，即定出工艺流程同控制流程的参数间的数学关系。这是一个最主要的问题，它的解决将为自动化的发展开辟道路。在数学关系已知时，计算机的制造在原则上并不太复杂。
    在自动学和计算技术方面的科学想法并不停留在已取得的成果上。现在它已经向着使机器自己来“研究”过程和确定未知数学关系的方向发展了，已经研究出来了一些基本原理，利用它们可以制造一种机器，即使不知道某个工艺过程的精确的数学描述，也可以自动维持工艺过程中的参数使处于最有利的状况。在这里只要知道哪些参数对过程的进行有影响就够了，不必预先知道这一影响的量值的大小。最后将可能制造这样一种机器，它同人一样，在工程过程中能够获得经验，并且随着经验的积累而改进自己的工作。这就是所谓自动调整的或自动学习的机器。现代电子计算机的作用就是这样的：它们实际上能够完成人类特有的任何“理智”的动作，只要人已经认识了这些动作的逻辑。
    电子计算机的这种特性使得某些哲学家得出了把人和机器等量齐观的“结论”。又因为用机器完成人所指定的那些运算，一般比人来得快而完善，所以有人甚至作出这样的结论，认为人在未来要成为“机器的奴隶”。这种论调是完全没有根据的，因为无论机器如何完善，它总是完成人所给予它的任务。
    上面所说的利用电子计算机的各方面远不能包括它们的全部可能性。经济分析与统计、运输调度、一般情报工作（包括图书馆中为读者服务）问题，都可以依靠电子计算机，更正确地说，依靠专门的计算机（它的原理同电子计算机一样）来更有效地解决。
    计算技术对于我们科学的发展和对于我国国民经济的重要意义，在苏共二十一次代表大会上所制定的苏联发展国民经济的七年计划中得到了反映。计算机的生产量到七年计划的末期将增加四点五至四点七倍。这样，各科学技术部门对这种聪明的机器——创造性的人类智慧的仆人——的急迫需要将会得到满足。
