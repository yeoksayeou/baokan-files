    Transparent Printed Cloth
    Transparent printed cloth is another recent success of the Shanghai Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory. The edges of the patterns are outlined with white paint, and the flowers and leaves are transparent and clear. The transparent flowers on this cloth can last for a long time.

    透明印花布
    透明花布也是最近上海新丰印染厂试制成功的。花纹的四边用白色涂料作轮廓，花叶透明清晰。这种布上的透明花可以保持很久。
