Looking at Historical Figures Dialectically
Ji Wenfu

There has been much discussion about the historical evaluation of Cao Cao. It seems that Cao Cao was a heroic figure in the feudal ruling class, an outstanding military strategist, politician, and poet, who played a progressive role at the time and should be affirmed. However, at the same time, his suppression of the Yellow Turban Uprising and his mass slaughter of the people exposed his ferocious class nature, which is unforgivable. But there are two extreme arguments: one seems to want to completely erase his achievements, while the other seems to beautify him too much. This has led to debate, which prompts us to better understand the dialectics of historical development.

History has developed along a complex, tortuous, and contradictory path. In terms of class relations, in feudal society, there was not only the fundamental contradiction between the feudal ruling class and the broad masses of people, but also the contradictions between the various strata and groups within the feudal ruling class, intertwined with this basic contradiction, promoting and influencing each other. Even between the feudal ruling class and the broad masses of people, there was also a side of mutual penetration and mutual transformation accompanying the contradiction and struggle. Separating from this complex relationship and talking about the struggle between the feudal ruling class and the broad masses of people in isolation, it is easy to simplify the problem and draw one-sided conclusions.

Generally speaking, since they belong to the feudal ruling class, they are inevitably on the opposite side of the people, exploiting them. Take the slaughter of the people, for example. Not only Cao Cao, but also the Han ancestors and Tang emperors, every dynasty and every generation, had countless blood debts. Tang Zhen, a scholar in the early Qing Dynasty, said long ago: "Alas! Since the Zhou and Qin dynasties, emperors, generals, heroes, and all those who wielded knives were butchers, and the elders, women, and children were all their sheep and pigs." "Since the Qin Dynasty, all those who have been emperors are thieves." He thoroughly exposed the dark rule of feudal emperors. However, if we look at it only from this aspect, there is no need to make any further evaluation of those emperors and generals in history. What good emperor or bad emperor, they are all birds of a feather. However, the people still hope for a good emperor. Indeed, the position of the people at that time was just like Marx's Buridan's donkey, "it does not choose which bale of hay is better between two bales of hay, but chooses which beating is more painful between two beatings." Being beaten lightly is better than being beaten more painfully after all. A good emperor is more beneficial to the people's lives and the development of history than a bad emperor. Although it was all warlords fighting each other to seize hegemony, Cao Cao, compared with Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu, Lü Bu, and others, represented a more progressive class and group, and still had a set of political ideals, cared about the governance of the world, and made some careers that were more suitable for the needs of the times and the aspirations of the people. As a feudal ruler, some of Cao Cao's political measures were still the lighter beating that the people wanted to choose at that time. It is unfair and inconsistent with historical facts to put Cao Cao on a par with Yuan Shao and others, or even to think that he was more sinful than those people, and was "the number one enemy of the people of the Three Kingdoms," "a butcher whose purpose was to poison the people," and "a devil who enjoyed destroying the world." Without Cao Cao, the true "devils" like Lü Bu and Yuan Shu, who had no political minds, would not know how long they would fight. Unifying the north, "gradually stabilizing the society that had collapsed at the end of the Han Dynasty, restoring and developing the production order in the Yellow River basin, and enabling displaced people to live and work in peace," Cao Cao's achievements cannot be buried.

So, can we say that Cao Cao "although he fought the Yellow Turbans, did not violate the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising," and even "organized" and "inherited the Yellow Turban movement"? I think there is a problem here. It seems to me that by saying this, Cao Cao is simply transformed from a suppressor of the Yellow Turbans into an inheritor and leader of the Yellow Turbans, representing both the feudal ruling class and the peasants. In this way, beautifying Cao Cao is a minor matter, I am afraid it will make people blur the class boundaries, right? I think no matter how good Cao Cao is, he cannot be placed above Liu Bang, Li Shimin, Zhu Yuanzhang, etc., just as no matter how bad Cao Cao is, he cannot be compared with Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu, Lü Bu, etc. If Cao Cao can be praised like this, then people like Liu Bang and Zhu Yuanzhang can even be called peasant emperors, and the so-called "deterioration" and "plunder of the fruits of the peasant war" should not be added to them. True, Engels said in the preface to "The Condition of the Working Class in England": "The revolution of 1848, like many previous revolutions, had a strange fate. It was precisely those who suppressed it who became—as Karl Marx often liked to say—its testamentary executors. Louis Napoleon had to establish a unified and independent Italy, Bismarck had to carry out a kind of transformation in Germany and give Hungary a certain degree of independence, and the British factory owners had no choice but to give the People's Charter the force of law." But this is not to evaluate certain historical figures, but only to explain an objective law, and to point out the dialectics of historical development. These "testamentary executors" did it against their own will under "have to". This is called forced concessions. This is the victory of the people, the victory of the objective law of historical development. Marx and Engels never gave too high an evaluation to figures like Louis Napoleon and Bismarck.

Let us carefully chew over the passage of Chairman Mao's on the Chinese peasant war that has been quoted thousands of times. On the one hand, Chairman Mao said that in Chinese feudal society, only this kind of peasant war was "the real driving force of historical development," but at the same time, he said that it "always ended in failure." Saying that it failed is because every peasant war, "was always exploited by landlords and nobles in and after the revolution, and used as a tool for them to change dynasties," and the feudal rule basically continued, and did not complete the fundamental historical task of the peasant revolution. Saying that it promoted historical progress is because every peasant war, "struck a blow to the feudal rule at that time, and thus promoted the development of social productive forces to some extent," making "society somewhat progressive." At the beginning of each "change of dynasty," the new dynasty often reformed the malpractices of the previous dynasty and took some measures of concession to the peasants, and the role of the peasant war in promoting historical progress was manifested from here. The feudal ruling class used the peasant war as a tool for them to change dynasties, but the peasants also advanced their historical cause through the political measures of the feudal ruling class. On the one hand, it is a series of failures and progress; on the other hand, it is a series of suppressions and concessions. This is the basic situation of the class struggle between the peasants and the feudal ruling class in the long historical period, and this is the dialectics of historical development. If we only see the ruling class suppressing and exploiting the peasants, and completely deny their certain concessionary measures, it is equivalent to saying that the peasant war only has a series of failures, and how can it show that it pushes history forward. Conversely, if we overemphasize those concessionary measures of the feudal ruling class, and think that the purpose of the peasant war is nothing more than this, then it would inevitably belittle the fundamental significance of the peasant war against feudalism, and there is no need to say that it "always ends in failure."

Let's take a look at how Marx evaluated Louis Napoleon. At the same time that Marx wrote "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte", there were two noteworthy books on the same topic, one was Hugo's "Napoleon the Little", and the other was Proudhon's "Coup d'état". The former book only made some "spicy and humorous scolding" and "loud cries of moral indignation" against Louis Napoleon, without making an objective historical analysis of that coup; on the contrary, the latter book "wanted to describe the coup as the result of previous historical development; however, his historical explanation of the coup unconsciously became a historical defense of the protagonist of the coup". As for Marx's book, it described the internal connection of the entire historical process in France since the February Revolution, and "explained" this coup as "the natural and inevitable result of this connection," while expressing "complete and deserved contempt" for the protagonist of the coup, "explaining how the class struggle in France created some conditions and situations that allowed a mediocre and ridiculous figure to play a heroic role." Objective historical analysis and personal historical evaluation are so well coordinated. Of course, Cao Cao and Louis Napoleon, born in different countries and times, played different historical roles, and cannot be compared with each other. However, from here we can very well learn how to evaluate historical figures and how to grasp the dialectics of historical development.

    辩证地看待历史人物
    嵇文甫
    关于曹操的历史评价问题大家谈得很多了。看起来，曹操是封建统治阶级中的一位英雄人物，一位杰出的军事家、政治家和诗人，在当时起过进步作用，是应该肯定的。但同时，他镇压黄巾起义，大量屠杀人民，暴露出他凶恶的阶级本质，也是不容宽恕的。可是有两种极端论调：一种似乎要把他的功绩干脆一笔抹杀，另一种却又似乎把他太美化了。这就引起争论，这种争论促使我们多体会些历史发展的辩证法。
    历史是沿着错综复杂，迂回曲折，充满着矛盾的道路发展下来的。就阶级关系来说，在封建社会中，不仅始终存在着封建统治阶级和广大人民间的基本矛盾，同时伴随着的，还有封建统治阶级内部各阶层和各集团间的矛盾，和这个基本矛盾交织在一起，彼此互相推动，互相影响着。就是在封建统治阶级和广大人民之间，伴随着矛盾斗争的，也还有互相渗透，互相转化的一面。抛开这种错综复杂的关系，而孤立地来谈封建统治阶级和广大人民间的斗争，就很容易把问题简单化，得出片面性的结论。
    一般地说，既然是属于封建统治阶级的人物，就总不免和人民站在敌对方面，压榨人民。就拿屠杀人民来说吧，岂止曹操，无论汉祖，唐宗，那一朝，那一代，都有数不尽的血债。清初学者唐甄早说过：“悲哉！周秦以后，君将豪杰，皆鼓刀之屠人，父老妇子皆其羊豕也”。“自秦以来，凡为帝王者皆贼也”。一部封建帝王黑暗统治史被他彻底揭破。可是，如果专从这一方面看，对于历史上那些帝王将相，就根本用不着再作什么评价。什么好皇帝，坏皇帝，反正都是一丘之貉。但是，人民毕竟还是希望有个好皇帝。的确，当时人民所处的地位，正像马克思所说的步利丹驴子，“它不是在两包干草之间，选择那一包较好，而是在两阵棒打之间，选择那一阵打得更痛”。打得较轻，毕竟比打得更痛好些。好皇帝比坏皇帝，对于人民的生活，历史的发展，毕竟要有利些。尽管都是豪强混战，争夺霸权，但曹操比之袁绍、袁术、吕布等人，毕竟代表着比较进步的阶层和集团，毕竟还有一套政治理想，关心天下治乱，做出些比较能适合时代要求和人民愿望的事业。作为一个封建统治者，曹操的一些政治措施，毕竟还是当时人民所要选择的一阵较轻的棒打。把曹操和袁绍等人相提并论，甚至认为比那些人罪恶更大，是“三国人民的第一号敌人”，是“一个以荼毒生灵为目的的屠夫”，“一个以残破天下为乐事的混世魔王”，这是不公平的，是不符合历史事实的。如果没有曹操，像吕布、袁术等那班毫无政治头脑的，真正的“混世魔王”，还不知道要混战到几时。统一北方，“使汉末崩溃了的社会逐步安定下来，使黄河流域的生产秩序得到恢复和发展，使流离失所的人民得到安居乐业”，曹操的这些功绩是不容埋没的。
    那么，是否可以说曹操“虽然打了黄巾，并没有违背黄巾起义的目的”，并且加以“组织化”，“承继了黄巾运动”呢？我看这里面有问题。我觉得这样一讲，好像曹操简直从一个黄巾的镇压者，一变而成为黄巾的继承者和领导者，既代表了封建统治阶级，又代表了农民。这样一来，美化曹操，还是小事，恐怕要使人把阶级界限弄模糊了吧？我以为再讲曹操好，也不能把他放在刘邦、李世民、朱元璋等以上，犹之乎再讲曹操坏，也不能把他和袁绍、袁术、吕布等相提并论一样。如果对曹操可以这样称颂，那么像刘邦、朱元璋，更可以称为农民皇帝，而所谓“变质”，所谓“掠夺农民战争的果实”，这些评语都不应该加在他们身上了。不错，恩格斯在“英国工人阶级状况”的序言上说过：“1848年的革命，也像先前许多次革命一样，有一个奇怪的命运。正是那些镇压它的人变成了——正如卡尔·马克思常爱说的——它的遗言执行人。路易·拿破仑不得不建立统一和独立的意大利，俾斯麦不得不在德国进行一种变革并还给匈牙利某种程度的独立，而英国工厂主则只好赋予人民宪章以法律效力。”但这不是评价某些历史人物，而只是说明一种客观规律，指出历史发展的辩证法。这些“遗言执行人”都是在“不得不”的情况下，违反着他们自己的意志来做的。这叫作被迫让步。这是人民的胜利，是历史发展客观规律的胜利。对于路易·拿破仑和俾斯麦那些人物，马克思和恩格斯从来没有给他们过高的评价。
    我们还是把曾经被人引用过千百遍的毛主席论中国农民战争那段话再仔细咀嚼一下吧。毛主席一方面说，在中国封建社会中，只有这种农民战争才是“历史发展的真正动力”，同时却又说它“总是陷于失败”。说它失败者，是因为每次农民战争，“总是在革命中和革命后被地主和贵族利用了去，当作他们改朝换代的工具”，封建统治基本上依然继续下来，并没有完成农民革命根本的历史任务。说它推动历史前进者，是因为每次农民战争，“都打击了当时的封建统治，因而也就多少推动了社会生产力的发展”，使“社会多少有些进步”。在每一次“改朝换代”之初，新王朝往往能改革前代弊政，对农民采取一些让步的措施，而农民战争推动历史前进的作用也就从这里表现出来。封建统治阶级利用农民战争作为他们改朝换代的工具，农民却也通过封建统治阶级的政治措施把自己的历史事业向前推进。一方面是节节失败，节节进展；另一方面是节节镇压，节节让步。这就是农民和封建统治阶级在漫长的历史时期中的阶级斗争的基本形势，这就是历史发展的辩证法。如果只看见统治阶级镇压农民，利用农民，而完全否定他们的某些让步措施，那就等于说农民战争只有一连串的失败，又何从表现出它把历史推向前进。反过来说，如果过分夸大封建统治阶级的那些让步措施，认为农民战争的目的也不过如此，那就未免贬低了农民战争反封建的根本意义，也不必说它“总是陷于失败”了。
    我们还是看一看马克思怎样评价路易·拿破仑吧。马克思著“路易·波拿巴政变记”的同时，有两部值得注意的写同一课题的书，一部是雨果著的“小拿破仑”，另一部是蒲鲁东著的“政变”。前一本书只是对路易·拿破仑作了些“辛辣的和诙谐的詈骂”，“道义忿怒的高声叫骂”，而并没有对那一政变作客观的历史分析；恰好相反，后一本书“想要把政变描述成为先前历史发展的结果；但是，他对于这个政变所作的历史的说明，却不知不觉地变成了对于政变主人公所作的历史的辩护了”。至于马克思的书，却叙述了从二月革命以来法国全部历史过程的内在联系，把这次政变“解释为这种联系的自然和必然的结果”，同时，对政变主人公却“表示完全应该的轻蔑”，“说明法国阶级斗争怎样创造了一些条件和情势，使得一个平凡而可笑的人物能扮演了英雄的角色”。客观的历史分析和个人的历史评价，配合得这样巧妙。当然，曹操和路易·拿破仑，生在不同的国度和时代，起着不同的历史作用，不能互相比拟。但是，从这里我们正可以很好地学习怎样评价历史人物，怎样掌握历史发展的辩证法。
