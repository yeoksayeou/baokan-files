Xinhua News Agency, 22nd Dispatch from Buenos Aires: During a recent discussion in Argentina on "Imperialist Penetration of Latin America," some Latin American figures angrily denounced the United States for carrying out economic aggression, strangling national industries, supporting dictators, and using the "Organization of American States" to obstruct the people's revolutions in Latin America.

This discussion was part of the "Anti-Imperialist Struggle Week" initiated by the Youth Department of the Argentine Progressive Democratic Party.

Former Guatemalan Ambassador to Argentina, Galich, condemned the "Organization of American States," saying that its policy was to "activate its diplomatic machinery to obstruct the people's revolutions in Latin America." He said that since the first target of revolutionary attacks was American economic encroachment, and any land reform in any country would conflict with American large estates, the United States was attempting to use this organization to "monitor Latin America to prevent the resurgence of people's revolutions."

Exiles from Dominica, Guatemala, Peru, and Paraguay pointed out in their speeches that "the tyrant Trujillo was fostered single-handedly by American sugar monopolies"; and that the imperialist invasion of Guatemala and the overthrow of the Arbenz government was an act of "shamelessness to the extreme." These individuals also said that in Peru, "the International Monetary Fund and the Export-Import Bank strangled nascent national industries," and "the reason why Stroessner's dictatorial regime in Paraguay has been able to maintain itself is because the United States State Department has given it direct aid."

All speakers pointed out that Latin American youth must support the Cuban Revolution—"the vanguard of the anti-imperialist struggle in Latin America."

Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch from Buenos Aires: The Speaker of the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies and Chairman of the Christian Social Party, Rafael Caldera, emphasized when speaking at a meeting of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies on the 16th that Latin American countries should adopt a common attitude towards the United States.

He said, "Only when North America and South America restore friendship on a new basis on the American continent, will there be fairness and consolidated peace. We should adopt a common attitude towards the United States, and this attitude can only be friendly understanding, but it must be friendly on an equal footing. We must raise our issues with one voice."

Caldera emphasized that "now is the time for Latin American countries to unite." He said, "If twenty million Argentines, six and a half million Venezuelans, or even sixty million Brazilians cannot make the United States accept their demands in the face of its enormous power, then one hundred and eighty million Latin Americans raising these demands again can establish economic and political relations between (Latin American countries and the United States) on the basis of justice and independence."

Referring to the upcoming meeting of the twenty-one foreign ministers of the Americas, Caldera said, "We deeply fear that this Pan-American organization will leave a bad impression in the minds of our people if they see that it is only a tool serving the dictatorial regimes that shamefully tarnish the dignity of the Americas."

    拉丁美洲各界人士纷纷发表谈话
    怒斥美国侵害拉丁美洲民族主权
    新华社22日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：在阿根廷的一些拉丁美洲人士最近在这里讨论“帝国主义对拉丁美洲的渗入”问题时，怒斥美国进行经济侵略、扼杀民族工业、扶植独裁者、并利用“美洲国家组织”阻挠拉丁美洲的人民革命。
    这次讨论会是由阿根廷进步民主党青年部发起的“反帝斗争周”的一个组成部分。
    前危地马拉驻阿根廷大使加利奇在会上谴责说，“美洲国家组织”的政策就是“开动它的外交机器阻挠拉丁美洲的人民革命”。由于遭到革命打击的首先是美国的经济侵入，任何国家的土地改革都要同美国的大地产发生冲突，因此，美国企图通过这个组织“监视拉丁美洲以防止人民革命的再起”。
    多米尼加、危地马拉、秘鲁和巴拉圭的流亡者在发言中指出，“暴君特鲁希略是美国糖业垄断组织一手扶植起来的”；而帝国主义侵入危地马拉、推翻阿本斯政府更是“厚颜无耻到极点”的勾当。这些人士还说，在秘鲁，“国际货币基金组织和进出口银行扼杀了初生的民族工业”，“巴拉圭斯特罗斯纳的独裁政权所以能够维持下去，是因为美国国务院给了它直接援助”。
    所有讲话的人都指出，拉丁美洲青年必须支持古巴革命——“拉丁美洲反帝斗争的先锋”。
    新华社20日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：委内瑞拉众议院议长、基督教社会党主席拉斐尔·卡尔德拉16日在阿根廷众议院会议上发言时，强调拉丁美洲国家应对美国采取共同的态度。
    他说，“在美洲大陆上，只有北美和南美在新的基础上恢复友谊，才会有公平，才会有巩固的和平。我们应该对美国采取共同的态度，这个态度只能是友好的谅解，但要双方平等地友好，我们要异口同声地提出我们的问题”。
    卡尔德拉强调指出，“现在是拉丁美洲国家团结的时候”。他说，“如果二千万阿根廷人，六百五十万委内瑞拉人甚至六千万巴西人在美国的巨大权力面前还不能使它接受他们的要求，那么一亿八千万拉丁美洲人重新提出这些要求，就能够使（拉丁美洲国家和美国的）经济和政治关系建立在正义和独立自主的基础上”。
    卡尔德拉谈到即将举行的美洲二十一国外长会议说，“我们深恐，这个泛美组织要在我们人民的头脑中留下恶劣的印象，如果他们看到，它只是一个为可耻的沾污美洲尊严的独裁政权服务的工具的话。”
