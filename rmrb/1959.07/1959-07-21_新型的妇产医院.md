A New Type of Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital
By our reporter Liu Peiheng

　　On Qigelou, east of the Forbidden City, a magnificent new I-shaped building has been erected. This is the Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, which recently opened in the capital.

　　The hospital has a total of two hundred and fifty beds. Currently, it only admits pregnant women with difficult labor, those having their first or fifth (or higher) child, and gynecology patients. All beds face south, providing mothers and babies with ample sunlight and fresh air. Feng Shuzhen, a salesperson at Xinhua Bookstore, was the first pregnant woman admitted to the hospital. She gave birth to her first baby smoothly that evening. She said very happily, "I am so happy to be able to stay in such a comfortable maternity hospital!" Her little baby is also growing plump and sleeping soundly in the nursery, quite lovable.

　　The nursery in this hospital pays the closest attention to strict disinfection and isolation. The babies' rooms are separated by specially made glass partitions, which makes it easier for nurses to take care of them. Each room has a shower pool, specially designed for babies. When giving the baby a bath every day, the nurse holds the baby in her hand, and only needs to use her left and right arms to flip two iron bar-like switches, and the tap sprays out thin streams of water, letting the baby bathe in bursts of "drizzle." The beds for the babies are also specially made, with pull-out boxes and drawers underneath. Each child's supplies are placed there separately. When the nurse changes the baby's diaper or provides care, she pulls open the pull-out box or drawer, and everything is ready, which can avoid and reduce the chance of disease infection.

　　Having many entrances is also a characteristic of this hospital. Pregnant women with normal deliveries and those with high blood pressure, heart disease, and other illnesses are checked, bathed, and have their hair cut separately, entering the hospital through different routes. This is to avoid internal cross-infection and mutual transmission of diseases. Outpatient clinics and sanatorium staff, gynecology outpatient clinics and obstetrics outpatient clinics, physiological obstetrics and pathological obstetrics, gynecology patients, and administrative staff and medical staff do not cross paths, each using different traffic routes.

　　Some of the doctors in this hospital were originally from the Beijing Maternal and Child Health Experimental Institute, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and Peking Union Medical College Hospital, where they had worked for many years. They have rich clinical and teaching experience, and some doctors have more than twenty years of clinical experience. Lin Qiaozhi, a famous Chinese obstetrics and gynecology expert, serves as the president of this hospital. (Attached photo)

    新型的妇产医院
    本报记者　刘佩珩
    在故宫东侧的骑河楼，新建起一幢巍峨壮观的工字大楼，这就是不久前在首都新开业的北京市妇产医院。
    这个医院一共二百五十张病床。现在，它只接收难产的和第一胎或第五胎以上的孕妇及妇科患者。病床全部是南向。住在这里的母亲和婴儿有充分的阳光和新鲜的空气。新华书店的营业员冯淑珍，是这个医院第一个接受入院的产妇，当天晚上就顺利地生下了第一胎婴儿。她非常满意地说：“我能住在这样舒适的产院，心里真有说不出的高兴劲儿！”她的小娃娃也长的胖胖的，在婴儿室里酣睡着，挺讨人喜欢。
    这个院婴儿室的工作最注意严密消毒及隔离，小娃娃们的房间都是用特制的玻璃隔断的，便于护士照顾。各房间都有一个淋浴池。这是特为婴儿设置的。每天给婴儿洗澡时，护士把婴儿托在手上，只用左右胳膊拨开两根铁棒似的开关，自来水龙头就喷出细细的水丝，让婴儿沐着阵阵的“毛毛雨”。婴儿睡的床也是特制的，床下有拉箱和抽屉，每个孩子的用具都分别放在那里边，护士给婴儿换尿布或进行护理时，拉开拉箱或抽屉，就万事齐备，这样可以避免和减少疾病感染的机会。
    门多，也是这个医院的特点。正常生产的孕妇来院和患有高血压、心脏病等病的产妇，都分别进行检查、洗澡、理发，走不同路线入院。这是为避免内部的交叉感染和疾病的互相传播。门诊与休养员、妇科门诊与产科门诊、生理产科和病理产科、妇科就诊者，以及行政人员与医务人员，都是互不交叉，各自来往不同的交通路线。
    这个医院有些医师，都是原来北京市妇幼保健实验院、中国医学科学院和北京协和医院工作多年的。他们有着丰富的临床与教学经验，有些医生已有二十多年临床经验。我国著名妇产科专家林巧稚担任这个医院的院长。（附图片）
