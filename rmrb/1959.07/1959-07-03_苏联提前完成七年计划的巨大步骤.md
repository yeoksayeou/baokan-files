Editorial

    The recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) discussed the implementation of the resolutions of the 21st CPSU Congress regarding the acceleration of technological innovation in industry and construction. This included the comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes in industry and construction, the application of new technologies to further expand industrial production and construction, and the improvement of product quality and reduction of costs. The session also addressed accelerating the development of the chemical industry and further developing the textile industry. Comrade Khrushchev delivered an important speech at the meeting. The plenary session adopted a resolution to accelerate technological innovation to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The session also issued an appeal to all working people of the Soviet Union, calling for a widespread nationwide socialist competition for technological innovation to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This significant meeting opened a new chapter in Soviet technological innovation and marked an important step towards achieving the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan.
    The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the comprehensive construction of communism, with its grand scale and bright prospects, greatly inspired the labor enthusiasm of all the Soviet people. In the months since the closing of the 21st CPSU Congress, the Soviet people have launched a vibrant socialist competition. In this competition, they have widely boosted their enthusiasm, tapped potential, increased production, improved quality, reduced costs, and increased labor productivity, striving to complete the Seven-Year Plan in six years or even less. The Soviet Union's production plan for the first half of this year has already been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded; compared with the same period last year, the Soviet Union's total industrial output value increased by 11% in the first half of this year. The Soviet working people have achieved a successful start in their efforts to realize the Seven-Year Plan. This is a great encouragement to the socialist countries that are confidently supporting each other in building socialism, and it is also a great encouragement to the people of all countries who love peace.
    In all efforts to strive for the smooth and early completion of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet people attach particular importance to the adoption of new technologies. The resolutions of the 21st CPSU Congress emphasized that the widespread adoption of new technologies, the comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes, is one of the decisive conditions for the successful completion of the Seven-Year Plan and the establishment of the material and technical base of communism. Soviet workers vividly call the mechanization and automation of production "the two wings of the Seven-Year Plan." Therefore, the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that in the next seven years, heavy manual labor in all sectors of the national economy must be completely eliminated on the basis of comprehensive mechanization of production processes, the transition from automation of certain units and machine installations to comprehensive automation will be made, and fully automated workshops and enterprises will be established. This plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee focused on discussing technological innovation, especially the comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes, and decided that the entire party and the entire people should concentrate their efforts on completing the tasks in this area proposed by the 21st CPSU Congress.
    Since the 20th CPSU Congress in 1956, the Soviet Union has made great strides in technological innovation in various sectors of the national economy. During this period, the Soviet Union has adopted advanced technological processes on a large scale in industry and construction, greatly increasing the level of mechanization, especially the mechanization of heavy manual labor. Automation of many production operations has been achieved in industry, construction, and transportation. In recent years, the Soviet Union has reached the peak of world science and technology in many cutting-edge scientific and technological fields, such as: space rockets, artificial satellites, jet engines, peaceful use of atomic energy, radio electronics, semiconductors, remote control technology, and radioactive isotopes, which has created favorable conditions for the comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes in the Soviet Union. The Seven-Year Plan formulated by the 21st CPSU Congress again regards technological innovation as an important link in realizing the Seven-Year Plan. After the congress, Soviet technological innovation has made significant and important progress. At present, comprehensive automation has been gradually realized in the main sectors of Soviet industries such as coal mining and electric power. There are already more than 350 automated production lines, automated workshops, and factories in the machine-building industry; during the Seven-Year Plan period, Soviet production automation will be highly developed, with 1,500 new automated production lines and more than 50 automated factories put into production. The efforts made by the Soviet party and people in realizing technological innovation will greatly shorten the time for realizing the Seven-Year Plan, accelerate communist construction, and advance the time for surpassing the United States in terms of per capita production levels and achieving a decisive victory for the socialist system in the peaceful competition.
    The efforts made by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in technological innovation, especially the comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes, fully embody the superiority of the socialist system and the Communist Party's infinite concern for the people's welfare. As everyone knows, in capitalist countries, the automation of production only brings new profits to the capitalists, but what it brings to the workers is unemployment and increased labor intensity; while in socialist countries, the automation of production means improving the people's living standards, reducing labor, shortening working days and working weeks, and creating excellent learning conditions for the working people. As pointed out in the appeal to all working people of the Soviet Union by this plenary session: The huge measures for comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes in all sectors of the national economy stipulated by the CPSU Central Committee aim to improve the people's lives, increase the people's material and spiritual wealth, and further strengthen the power of the Soviet Union.
    This plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee fully discussed the issue of technological innovation that the entire Soviet working people are most concerned about, as well as the issue of accelerating the development of the chemical industry and further developing the textile industry; the entire Soviet working people immediately responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and widely launched a socialist competition for technological innovation. All of these embody the rock-solid unity of the Soviet party and people, and demonstrate the determination and confidence of the Soviet party and people to realize the grand program of communist construction - the Seven-Year Plan - ahead of schedule.

    苏联提前完成七年计划的巨大步骤
    最近苏共中央举行了全体会议，讨论了执行苏共第二十一次代表大会关于加速工业和建筑业中的技术革新的决议方面的工作问题，即在工业和建筑业中实行生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，运用新技术来进一步扩大工业生产和工业建设，提高产品质量和降低成本等问题，同时讨论了加速发展化学工业和进一步发展纺织工业的问题。赫鲁晓夫同志在会上作了重要的发言。全会作出了加速技术革新以提前完成七年计划的决议。全会还发出了告全苏劳动人民书，号召为提前完成七年计划而广泛展开技术革新的全民社会主义竞赛。这个意义重大的会议，揭开了苏联技术革新的新页，为争取提前完成七年计划迈开重要的一步。
    全面展开共产主义建设的苏联七年计划，以它的宏伟的规模和光辉的前景，大大鼓舞了苏联全体人民的劳动热情。苏共第二十一次代表大会闭幕以来几个月，苏联人民展开了如火如荼的社会主义竞赛。在这个竞赛的运动中，他们广泛地鼓起干劲，发掘潜力，增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，提高劳动生产率，争取在六年甚至在更短的时期内完成七年计划。苏联今年上半年的生产计划已经提前和超额完成；与去年同期比较，今年上半年苏联的工业总产值增加了11％。苏联劳动人民在实现七年计划的努力中旗开得胜。这是对于正在满怀信心地为建设社会主义而互相支援的社会主义各国人民的巨大鼓舞，也是对于爱好和平的各国人民的巨大鼓舞。
    在争取顺利地提前完成七年计划的种种努力中，苏联人民特别重视新技术的采用。苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议中强调指出，新技术的广泛采用、生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，是顺利完成七年计划和建立共产主义物质技术基础的决定性条件之一。苏联工人形象地把生产的机械化和自动化叫做“七年计划的两个翅膀”。因此，七年计划中规定，在今后七年中，要在生产过程全盘机械化的基础上完全消灭国民经济一切部门中繁重的手工劳动，将由某些机组、机器装置的自动化过渡到全盘自动化，将建立完全自动化的车间和企业。这次苏共中央全会着重讨论了技术革新，特别是生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化的问题，并且决定今后全党全民集中精力完成苏共二十一次代表大会所提出的这方面的任务。
    自从1956年苏共第二十次代表大会以来，苏联在国民经济各部门的技术革新方面已经迈进了远大的一步。在这一时期中，苏联在工业和建筑业中大规模地采用了先进的工艺过程，大大地提高了机械化的水平，特别是重体力劳动的机械化水平。在工业、建筑业和运输业中实现了许多生产操作的自动化。近几年来，苏联在许多尖端科学技术，例如：宇宙火箭、人造卫星、喷气发动机、和平利用原子能、无线电子学、半导体、遥控技术、放射性同位素等方面已登上了世界科学技术的高峰，这就给苏联生产过程中的全盘机械化和自动化创造了优越的条件。在苏共第二十一次代表大会所制定的七年计划中，又把技术革新作为实现七年计划的重要环节。代表大会后，苏联的技术革新有了显著的重要的发展。目前，在苏联的采煤、电力等工业的主要部门已经逐渐实现了全盘自动化。在机器制造业中已有三百五十多条自动化作业线、自动化的车间和工厂；而七年计划期间，苏联的生产自动化将有高度的发展，将有一千五百条新的自动化作业线和五十多个自动化工厂投入生产。苏联党和人民在实现技术革新方面所作的努力，将大大缩短实现七年计划的期限，加速共产主义建设，使在按人口平均计算生产水平方面提早超过美国，社会主义制度在和平竞赛中取得决定性胜利的时期，也将提前到来。
    苏联共产党在技术革新，特别是生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化方面所作的努力，充分体现了社会主义制度的优越性和共产党对人民生活福利的无限关怀。尽人皆知，在资本主义国家里，生产的自动化只是给资本家带来新的利润，给工人带来的却是失业和劳动强度的增加；而在社会主义国家里，生产的自动化就意味着提高人民生活水平，减轻劳动，缩短工作日和工作周，为劳动人民创造优越的学习条件。正如这次全会告苏联全体劳动人民书中所指出：苏共中央全会所规定的国民经济所有部门生产过程全盘机械化和自动化的巨大措施，其目的在于改善人民的生活、增加人民的物质财富和精神财富、进一步加强苏联的威力。
    这次苏共中央全会充分地讨论了苏联全体劳动人民所最关心的技术革新的问题，以及加速发展化学工业和进一步发展纺织工业的问题；苏联全体劳动人民也立刻响应党的中央全会的号召，广泛地展开了技术革新的社会主义竞赛。所有这些都体现了苏联党和人民的坚如磐石的团结一致，显示了苏联党和人民提前实现共产主义建设的宏伟纲领——七年计划的决心和信心。
