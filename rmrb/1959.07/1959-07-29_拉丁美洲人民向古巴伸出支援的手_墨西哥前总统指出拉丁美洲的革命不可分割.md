Xinhua News Agency, July 28th – Latin American countries' public opinion is increasingly expressing sympathy and support for the Cuban revolution.

　　Argentine capital newspapers on the 27th all published front-page news about the commemorative activities celebrating the July 26th Movement in Havana. "Crítica" devoted an entire page to commemorate this significant day. The newspaper wrote that democratic forces around the world are welcoming this festival with joy and excitement.

　　Congratulatory letters flooded the Cuban Embassy in Argentina, and many people personally went to the embassy to pay their respects to the Cuban people.

　　The youth organization of the Paraguayan exiled party "February Party" in Argentina recently issued a statement supporting the Cuban youth in their struggle, paying tribute to the Cuban revolution, and expressing their commitment to fight for the establishment of a free Paraguay in solidarity with Cuba.

　　Colombian peasant leader De la Cruz Varela recently told reporters that the Cuban revolution is just. All Colombian people morally and materially support Cuba's liberation struggle. He condemned the U.S. State Department's attempt to control Latin American countries at any cost. He emphasized that the people of Latin America are now prepared, and it would be difficult for the United States to take the same measures against Cuba as it did to subvert the constitutional government of Guatemala in 1954. He said that Colombian farmers oppose the meeting of American foreign ministers to be held in the Chilean capital, because the United States will use this meeting to instigate new conspiracies against the Latin American people.

　　Guatemalan novelist Ángel Asturias, who was invited to attend the commemorative meeting of the July 26th Movement in Havana, told the Cuban press on the 26th that no one in Latin America believes the slanders against Cuba.

　　He said that the Guatemalan people, based on their own personal experience, can well see through the United States' slanders against Cuba, because the United States also carried out such slanders before overthrowing the Arbenz government in Guatemala in 1954.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 27th – Former Mexican President General Lázaro Cárdenas said yesterday at a mass rally of millions in Havana that the Cuban revolution has aroused a profound feeling of mutual support throughout Latin America.

　　Cárdenas said that the revolutionary cause is indivisible; it is the cause of the people of our countries who are so economically oppressed. He emphasized that the Mexican people support Cuba's land reform.

　　He said that the interventionists who are opposing Cuba's land reform today are precisely the same interventionists who opposed Mexico's land reform in the past. The Cuban revolution is being fiercely attacked by foreign oligarchic consortia, who have even fabricated insidious myths about this revolution. He said that the Cubans know how to respond to any provocation from those who oppose Cuba's land reform.

　　When talking about opposing foreign interference in Cuba's internal affairs, Cárdenas said that dictatorial regimes do not meet the demands of our Latin American era. They have made all kinds of slanders against the Cuban revolution, which are not new in terms of tactics. They used the tactics that the opponents of Mexico's social reform used many years ago. He said that we Mexicans are very clear that revolution cannot be imported or exported. We respect other countries, and we also ask others to respect the Cuban revolution, respect the people, respect their decisions, and respect their right to live according to their own will. Cárdenas emphasized that the Latin American people will shout "No Interference!" to foreign opposition to the Cuban revolution. He said that it is very unreasonable to accuse someone of organizing anti-American groups whenever someone in Latin America wants to recover their national wealth.

    拉丁美洲人民向古巴伸出支援的手
    墨西哥前总统指出拉丁美洲的革命不可分割
    新华社28日讯　拉丁美洲国家的舆论愈来愈多地表示对古巴革命的同情和支持。
    阿根廷首都报纸27日都以头版新闻刊登了在哈瓦那举行的庆祝7月26日运动的纪念活动。“评论报”以整版的篇幅来纪念这具有重大意义的日子。这家报纸写道，全世界的民主力量都以欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接这一节日。
    祝贺信像雪片一样被送到古巴驻阿根廷大使馆，同时，有许多人亲自跑到大使馆来向古巴人民致意。
    在阿根廷的巴拉圭流亡政党“二月党”的青年组织最近发表声明，支持斗争中的古巴青年，向古巴革命致敬，并表示要为建立一个与古巴团结一致的、自由的巴拉圭而奋斗。
    哥伦比亚农民领袖德拉克鲁斯·巴雷拉最近对记者发表谈话时指出，古巴革命是正义的。所有哥伦比亚人民在道义上和物质上都支持古巴的解放斗争。他谴责美国国务院不惜以任何代价企图控制拉丁美洲各国。他强调指出，现在拉丁美洲人民已有准备，美国对古巴采取1954年颠覆危地马拉立宪政府的那种手段是难于实现的。他说，哥伦比亚农民反对将在智利首都举行的美洲国家外长会议，因为美国将在这个会议策动反对拉丁美洲人民的新阴谋。
    应邀参加哈瓦那7月26日运动纪念大会的危地马拉著名小说家安赫耳·阿斯图里亚斯26日对古巴报界说，拉丁美洲任何人都不相信反对古巴的诽谤。
    他说，危地马拉人民出于自己的切身经验，能够很好地识破美国对古巴的诽谤，因为美国在1954年推翻危地马拉阿本斯政府前也曾进行了这种诽谤。
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　墨西哥前总统拉萨罗·卡德纳斯将军昨天在哈瓦那百万人的群众大会上说，古巴革命在整个拉丁美洲唤起了深刻的互相支援的感情。
    卡德纳斯说，革命事业是不可分割的，它是我们在经济上这样受压迫的各国人民的事业。他强调指出，墨西哥人民支持古巴的土地改革。
    他说，今天反对古巴土地改革的干涉者恰恰就是当年反对墨西哥土地改革的那些干涉者。古巴革命正在遭到外国寡头财团的猛烈进攻，他们甚至捏造了关于这个革命的阴险的神话。他说，对于反对古巴土地改革的人的任何挑衅，古巴人是懂得如何回答的。
    卡德纳斯在谈到反对外国干涉古巴的内政时说，独裁政权不符合我们拉丁美洲的时代要求。他们对古巴革命作出了形形色色的诽谤，策略上并不新鲜。他们使用了墨西哥社会改革的反对者很多年前所使用的策略。他说，我们墨西哥人很清楚，革命既不能输入也不能输出。我们尊重其它国家，同样我们也要求别人尊重古巴革命，尊重人民，尊重他们的决定和按照自己意志来生活的权利。卡德纳斯强调指出，拉丁美洲人民对外国反对古巴革命将高呼：“不许干涉！”他说，每当拉丁美洲人民中有人想收回自己的民族富源的时候，就被指控为在组织反美集团，这是非常不合理的。
