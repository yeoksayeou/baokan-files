Craft Art Scene in Full Bloom
A Visit to the Beijing Arts and Crafts Service Department
By our reporter Yao Shi

The window displays of the Beijing Arts and Crafts Service Department on the bustling Wangfujing Street in the capital often attract the attention of pedestrians. Various colorful arts and crafts exhibits are displayed there. If people have time to go in and take a closer look, they will find more practical and beautiful daily necessities and decorations.

Walking into the Arts and Crafts Service Department, one is greeted by dozens of glittering and dazzling arts and crafts, displayed in various glass cabinets. The sales staff patiently tells you the origin, use and price of various works of art, which increases your knowledge of the rich and colorful arts and crafts industry in China.

The artworks here come from all over the country, in a wide variety of varieties. There are ceramics, sculptures, inlays, embroidery, drawnwork, weaving, paper-cutting, velvet birds, silk flowers, etc. Among these varieties, the superb craftsmanship of the advanced artworks fully demonstrates the great achievements of China's arts and crafts industry.
        Practical and beautiful ceramics
Yixing pottery in Jiangsu, known as the "Pottery Capital", has many varieties and a wide range of uses. Among them, the most exquisite and internationally renowned is the Zisha (purple clay) ware. In China, whether in cities or villages, there are some people who like to drink tea, and they often put a Zisha teapot on their tea table. The characteristic of Zisha teapots is that the lid is tight, the tea does not lose its flavor, it is not easy to spoil in hot weather, and after using it for a long time, even if you put plain boiled water in it, it will have a tea fragrance. On display here are Squirrel and Grape Teapot, Lotus Leaf Teapot, Three Friends of Winter Teapot, etc., all of which are the crystallization of the wisdom of teapot makers. Zisha clay flowerpots also have the advantage of preventing root rot when planting flowers.
The porcelain of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi, the world-famous porcelain capital, has even more categories, mainly including two categories: decorative porcelain and practical porcelain. Whether decorative porcelain or practical porcelain, its color can last for a long time. Especially "Qinghua" (blue and white porcelain) becomes more beautiful as time goes by. The most attractive are the porcelain sculptures of figures and animals, which look lifelike and vivid. Especially the eight small porcelain cats, some standing, some sitting still, some playing ball, some staring blankly, some rolling around, and some waving to people, some seem to want people to caress them, the more you look at them, the more you love them. In addition, the porcelain sculptures of ancient figures, such as Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, and the Two Qiaos, are very exquisite and beautiful from facial expressions to clothing. Therefore, many people have purchased these artistic appreciation items and displayed them in their bookshelves for frequent appreciation.
What is even more worthy of people's cherishment is a batch of economical, beautiful and practical porcelain sculpture table lamp bases made by the arts and crafts sculptors of Jingdezhen, with a variety of styles such as "Chang'e Flying to the Moon" and "Daiyu", which can be used as table lamps with light bulbs, and can also be displayed and appreciated as works of art.
In addition, the porcelain of Liling in Hunan, second only to Jingdezhen, is mostly for daily use and also has its own unique style; the pottery vats and jars produced in Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, have generous shapes and beautiful patterns; the pottery of Shiwan in Guangdong and Jieshou in Anhui also have their own characteristics such as simplicity, elegance and bright colors.
        Sculptures with superb artistry
The sculpture section includes ivory carving, stone carving, wood carving, jade carving, clay sculpture, etc. Ivory carvings include landscape, flower and bird reliefs and openwork figures and landscapes. Yang Shihui, a famous Beijing ivory carving expert, recently completed two reliefs, "Chang'e Flying to the Moon" and "Eight Women Throwing Themselves into the River", which made people exclaim in admiration. In "Chang'e Flying to the Moon", the beautiful Chang'e's headdress and skirt are carved so exquisitely and elegantly. In the moon palace set off behind her, the charming moonlight and magnificent palace are even more beautiful than in paintings. In the relief "Eight Women Throwing Themselves into the River", the firm expressions of the eight female heroes who would rather die than surrender and the turbulent river make people feel awe.
The ivory eight horses produced in Guangzhou, some grazing, some resting, some jumping, some roaring, with different postures, can be described as wonderful. The stone carvings on display here are mostly table lamps, vases and smoking sets from Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, mostly openwork high relief landscapes, grapes and squirrels. Other wood carvings, jade carvings, etc. also have their own characteristics.
The most popular clay sculptures are the Wuxi clay figures and the "Clay Figure Zhang" colored sculptures with dramatic painting interest, all of which are lifelike and skillfully handcrafted.
        Exquisite and unique decorations
In the service department, there are also various birds and animals made of glass material by the workers of the Beijing Liaoliao Production Cooperative. Some of them are sets, such as a large peacock and four small peacocks, a group of chicks and a hen, etc., and there are also single birds and animals. These material products are smooth and bright, with vivid images. They are very elegant as decorations in the room and can also be given as gifts to relatives and friends as souvenirs. Because there are many people buying them, although this production cooperative has to produce 300,000 pieces every month, it is still in short supply.
What girls like most are the windows displaying various brooches, necklaces, and fans. It looks particularly dazzling and fragrant. The workers of the Beijing Filigree Inlay Factory have made various brooches with their skillful hands, which are very delicate and have their own characteristics. Like the small brooch with a sickle and axe standing on a peace dove and those ivory brooches, they are most loved by young girls. The bone-carved necklaces that look like kernels of corn connected together and strings of jasmine flowers strung together, and the Hangzhou sandalwood fans that smell fragrant from a distance, are both petite and exquisite, and beautiful and practical.
    Paper-cuts, Velvet Birds, Silk Flowers, Facial Masks
Stepping onto the second floor, the first thing you see are brightly colored paper-cuts, bookmark velvet birds, paper flowers, and Beijing opera masks.
Paper-cutting is one of the most popular art forms in my country. There are two ways to make it, one is carved with a knife, which can be mass-produced; the other is cut with scissors, each with different interests, mostly from the hands of rural women. The content of these paper-cuts is mostly taken from labor operations, opera stories, animals, flowers and birds, and so on. In our country's rural areas, it is customary to paste them on doors and windows to beautify the environment or symbolize the wishes of the working people. Didn't Xi'er in "The White-Haired Girl" once happily sing "The north wind is blowing..." while pasting paper-cuts on the clean windows preparing for the Spring Festival? Now there are more than 1,000 kinds of this kind of paper-cut in the art service department. Among them, the new products include the "Rice Harvest" from the northwest, various "Chrysanthemums" from Yangzhou, and "Dragon Boat" from Nanjing, and so on. Recently, Comrade Guo Moruo's "A Hundred Flowers Bloom" poetry collection has been created into a set of paper-cuts by Zhang Chengshou, a famous folk paper-cutting artist, which is particularly poetic.
Various poses of birds and animals made of velvet, hemp and silk produced in Jiangsu, Yangzhou, Beijing and other places, surrounded by landscapes, flowers and plants, are vivid and lively. The little bird standing in the cage and looking up seems to be looking for a partner. The ferocious beast made of yellow paper velvet really looks like it is about to pounce and bite.
The main producing area of silk flowers is Beijing, and silk is used to make various head flowers, corsages, flower baskets, and flower pots. The silk flowers displayed here, each flower and each leaf is so delicate and realistic. The new product yarn flower looks even lighter and more beautiful.
Beijing opera masks are famous in China, and have been popular since the Qing Dynasty. Now, the art service department has six or seven kinds of brightly colored and uniformly colored masks made of clay, plaster, pulp, wood, etc., all of which are made according to the personality and characteristics of each character. Ancient heroes and heroes such as Ban Chao, Lu Zhishen, Huyan Zhuo, and Guan Sheng are truly lifelike. The new Beijing opera masks that have recently been produced have also improved their expression depiction compared to the past.
        Magnificent embroidery
Embroidery, these elegant and exquisite handicrafts, come from Suzhou and Hunan. There are portraits, Zhongtang (hanging scrolls in the center of a wall), and screen strips that can be used as appreciation items, and there are also clothing fabrics, headscarves, handkerchiefs, shoe uppers, and quilt covers that can be used for daily use. On display here is a hall of silk tapestry screen strips and Suzhou embroidery Zhongtang, which can decorate a meeting room and living room in a magnificent manner and bring spring to the whole room. Xiang embroidery is an important sideline of rural women in Hunan. Because they are accompanied by the beautiful scenery of nature all year round, and often carefully observe the shapes and color changes of landscapes, flowers, birds and animals, they can carefully understand the artistic conception and expression of painting objects when embroidering, and embroider them vividly. Also on display here is a new product, Suzhou's small hanging screen, which is embroidered with Qi Baishi's paintings, including six goldfish chasing and playing, and six crabs crawling, which look the same as the paintings.
Weaving is a relatively popular handicraft. There are straw bags, straw mats, straw slippers, straw baskets, and straw hats woven from yellow grass, and various practical items woven from palm silk and bamboo, which have a simple folk style and are deeply loved by the people. The main ones are the thin bamboo fans and bamboo curtain paintings from Zigong, Sichuan, the exquisite bamboo baskets from Zhejiang and Fujian, and the economical and practical straw weaving from Jiading, Jiangsu, Gaoyao, Guangdong and other places.

    工艺坛上百花争艳
    访北京工艺美术服务部
    本报记者　姚湜
    在首都繁华的王府井大街，北京工艺美术服务部布置的橱窗，经常引起行人的注意。在那里面，陈列着各种各样五彩缤纷的工艺美术展品。人们如果有时间走进去细细观赏一下，还会发现更多实用美观的日用品和装饰品等。
    走进美术服务部，映入眼帘的是金光闪耀、艳丽夺目的几十种工艺美术品，分别陈列在各个玻璃柜内。售货员同志耐心地告诉你各种艺术品的产地、用途和价格，使你对祖国丰富多彩的工艺美术事业增长不少知识。
    这里的艺术品来自全国各地，品种繁多。有陶瓷器、雕塑、镶嵌、刺绣、挑补花、编织、剪纸、绒鸟、绢花等。在这些品种中，那手工高超的高级艺术品，充分显示了我国工艺美术事业的伟大成就。
        实用美观的陶瓷器
    素有陶都之称的江苏宜兴陶器，种类多、用途广，其中最精致并负有国际声誉的是紫砂器。在我国无论是城市或乡村，都有一些喜欢品茶的人，在他们的茶几上时常放着一把紫砂壶。紫砂壶的特点是盖口紧密，泡茶不走味，盛暑不易馊，用久后，就是放白开水，也有一股茶香。这里陈列的有松鼠葡萄壶、荷叶壶、岁寒三友壶等，都是制壶能手智慧的结晶。紫砂泥做的花盆还有种花不烂根的优点。
    驰名世界的瓷都江西景德镇的瓷器，名目更是繁多，主要有装饰瓷和实用瓷两大类。不论装饰瓷或实用瓷，它的色彩都能经久不变。尤其是“青花”年代越久越显得好看。最吸引人的是，那瓷雕人物和动物，看来表情逼真，栩栩如生。尤其是那八只小瓷猫，有的站着，有的静坐，有的在拍球，有的呆视，有的打滚，还有的在向人招手，有的似乎要人去爱抚它们，真是越看越爱看。另外，那瓷雕的古代人物，如梁山伯祝英台、二乔等，从面部表情到衣裙，都十分精致美观。因此，很多人都购买了这些艺术欣赏品，陈列在书柜里经常欣赏。
    更值得人们珍视的是景德镇工艺美术雕塑工人们制成的一批经济、美观、实用的瓷雕台灯座，有“嫦娥奔月”、“黛玉”等多种多样，既可以装上电灯泡作为台灯使用，还可以作为艺术品陈列和欣赏。
    此外，仅次于景德镇的湖南醴陵的瓷器，以日用品为最多，也有其独特的风格；四川省荣昌县出产的陶器缸、坛等，造型大方、花纹优美；广东石湾和安徽界首的陶器也都各有朴素优雅、色泽鲜明等特点。
        艺术高超的雕塑
    雕塑部分有牙雕、石雕、木雕、玉雕、泥塑等。牙雕有浮雕山水花鸟和镂空人物山水。著名的北京牙雕专家杨士惠最近完成的“嫦娥奔月”和“八女投江”这两座浮雕，使人看了不由得拍案叫绝。“嫦娥奔月”中那美丽的嫦娥从头饰到裙带都刻划得那样精美、优雅，后面衬托出的月宫里，那迷人的月色和富丽堂皇的宫庭，比画里的还要美。“八女投江”这座浮雕中八个女英雄宁死不屈的坚定神情和那汹涌澎湃的江水，使人肃然起敬。
    广州出产的象牙八马，有的吃草，有的休息，有的跳跑，有的怒吼，姿态各不相同，真称得上妙绝。这里陈列的石雕以浙江青田县的台灯、花瓶、烟具为最多，大都是镂空高浮雕的山水、葡萄松鼠。其他像木雕、玉雕等也都各有特点。
    泥塑方面最受广大人民欢迎的，是无锡泥人和富有戏剧绘画趣味的“泥人张”彩塑，都是形象逼真，手工精巧。
        精美别致的装饰品
    在服务部里，还有北京料器生产社的工人们用玻璃料制成的各种飞禽走兽。其中有成套的，如一个大孔雀和四个小孔雀，一群小鸡和一个母鸡等，也有单个的鸟兽。这些料制品光滑明亮，形象生动，作为室中的装饰品十分雅观，也可以作为礼物赠送亲友纪念。由于购买的人多，这个生产社虽然每月要生产出三十万个，但还是供不应求。
    姑娘们最喜欢的是那陈列着各种别针、项链、扇子的橱窗。那里分外显得琳琅满目，香气扑鼻。北京花丝镶嵌厂的工人们用他们灵巧的双手，做出了各种别针，十分精巧，各有特色。像那镰刀斧头上站着一只和平鸽的小别针和那些象牙别针，最为青年姑娘们所喜爱。远远看去像一颗颗玉米粒连在一起、一朵朵茉莉花串在一起的骨刻项链和那远远就闻到一股浓香的杭州檀香扇，既是娇小玲珑，又是美观适用。
    剪纸、绒鸟、绢花、脸谱
    踏上二楼，首先看到的是色彩鲜明的剪纸、书签绒鸟、纸花和北京脸谱等。
    剪纸是我国民间普遍流传的艺术形式之一。它的制作方法有两种，一种是用小刀刻的，能大量生产；另一种是用剪刀剪的，各有不同的趣味，大都出自农村妇女之手。这些剪纸的内容大多取材于劳动操作，戏曲故事，动物花鸟，等等。在我国农村中，相沿地把它贴在门窗上来美化环境或象征劳动人民的愿望。“白毛女”中的喜儿不是曾经一面愉快唱着“北风吹……”，一面把剪纸贴在准备过春节的明净的窗牖上吗？现在这种剪纸在美术服务部里有着一千多种。其中新产品有西北的
  “稻子丰收”，扬州的各种“菊花”，南京的“龙舟”，等等。最近，郭沫若同志的“百花齐放”诗集创作一套，已经由著名民间剪纸艺人张承寿制成剪纸，特别富有诗意。
    江苏、扬州、北京等地出产的用丝绒、麻和绢制成的各种姿态的鸟兽，周围配以山水花草，形象生动活泼。那在笼子里仰望站立的小鸟，似乎是在寻找伴侣。那黄色纸绒制成的凶猛的野兽，真像要扑人而噬。
    绢花的主要产地是北京，用绢制成各种头花、胸花、花篮、花盆。这里陈列出来的绢花，每一朵花、每一片叶子都是那么精致、逼真。新产品纱花，看上去更加轻巧美观。
    北京脸谱在国内是闻名的，从清代起已经风行一时。现在，美术服务部中有着泥土、石膏、纸浆、木头等六、七种色彩鲜艳均匀的脸谱，都是根据每个人物的性格、特点制成的。像班超、鲁智深、呼延灼、关胜等古代英雄豪杰，真是维妙维肖。最近北京出的新脸谱，在表情刻划上也比过去更提高了。
        瑰丽多彩的刺绣
    刺绣，这些优雅精美的手工艺品，出自苏州、湖南两地。有能够作为欣赏品的人像、中堂、屏条，也有可以日用的衣面、头巾、手绢、鞋面、被面等等。这里陈列着一堂缂丝的屏条和苏绣的中堂，能够把一间会议室和客厅点缀得富丽堂皇，满屋生春。湘绣是湖南农村妇女的重要副业，由于她们长年和自然界的秀丽景色为伴，经常细心地观察着山水、花卉、鸟兽等形状和色彩的变化，因而在刺绣时能够细致地体会画物的意境和神态，绣得维妙维肖。这里陈列的还有新产品苏州的小挂屏，是用齐白石的画稿刺绣成的，有六条金鱼追逐游戏，六个螃蟹爬行等，看上去和画的一样。
    编织品是比较大众化的手工艺品，有用黄草编的草包、草垫、草拖鞋、草篮子、草帽等，有用棕丝和竹子编的各种实用品，颇有朴素的民间风格，深为广大人民所喜爱。主要有四川自贡的质薄如绢的竹扇、竹帘画，浙江、福建的精致竹篮，江苏嘉定、广东高要等地经济实用的草编等。（附图片）
