Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: A mass movement to vigorously develop non-staple food production has been launched in Beijing. Beijing's state-owned farms and ranches, suburban people's communes, commune members, and various non-staple food production forces from government organs, military units, and schools, with the strong support and cooperation of commercial departments, are going all out, seizing the opportunity, and developing the production of vegetables, milk, and pigs, chickens, ducks, fish, and rabbits, etc., in accordance with local conditions.

Currently, more than 30 kinds of fresh vegetables such as tomatoes, eggplants, and cucumbers produced by the people's communes and state-owned farms in the near suburbs have successively matured and are being supplied to the market. The normal daily supply reaches more than 4 million jin, allowing each person in the city to eat an average of more than one jin of vegetables per day. As the peak production season has arrived, the supply of vegetables is gradually increasing. Beijing's commercial departments and some people's communes are planning to store and process a portion of the vegetables to compensate for the off-season supply. Although milk production is currently in the summer season, the daily supply to the market still reaches more than 100,000 pounds, an increase of 23.5% compared to the same period last year. Livestock and poultry production have also greatly developed after earnestly implementing the principle of combining public and private raising.

With the rapid development of urban construction and the increase in the urban employed population, as well as the rural communization and the great leap forward in production last year, the demand for non-staple foods from the vast suburban farmers has also been increasing day by day. In order to adapt to this new situation, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and party organizations at all levels attach great importance to doing a good job in non-staple food production and supply. In recent years, vegetable and animal husbandry production bases have been gradually established in the suburbs, and the output of vegetables and milk has been continuously increasing. In 1952, the average daily vegetable consumption per person in the city was 0.53 jin. Although the urban population has greatly increased in recent years, the average daily vegetable consumption per person last year increased to 0.81 jin. In order to vigorously develop production, the vegetable planting area in the suburbs last year reached more than 550,000 mu, an increase of more than seven and a half times compared to the early days of liberation in 1949, and the total output increased more than 14 times. This year, the vegetable planting area in the suburbs will be more than doubled compared to last year. If there are no major natural disasters, the vegetable supply will be guaranteed.

Due to the establishment of dairy cow production bases, milk production has also increased rapidly. In the early days of liberation, there were less than 2,000 dairy cows, and the milk yield and quality were very low. After 1952, three major dairy cow production bases were successively established in state-owned farms in the suburbs. Measures such as combining agriculture and animal husbandry, establishing feed bases, and cultivating healthy and high-yielding cow herds were taken to rapidly develop dairy cow production. At present, state-owned farms have a total of more than 11,000 dairy cows, including more than 5,000 adult dairy cows. In the first half of this year, milk production reached more than 20 million jin, an increase of more than 5 million jin compared to the same period last year, basically meeting the needs of hospitals, sanatoriums, nurseries, large hotels, the food industry, and some residents in the city.

The supply of meat, eggs, and aquatic products in Beijing has always mainly relied on transfers from other places. The various forces fighting on the non-staple food production front are actively developing production in this area, striving for self-reliance as the main focus and external assistance as supplementary. The more than 5,200 collective pig farms and many collective chicken farms, duck farms, and fish farms in the suburbs have formed a base for further developing non-staple food production. After the communes in the suburbs generally allocated feed land to the members and implemented the policy of retaining meat and oil for farmers after purchasing live pigs, the enthusiasm of the members for raising pigs and chickens has greatly increased. According to statistics at the end of June, the proportion of pigs raised privately by members in the total number of pigs raised in the city has increased from 27% at the end of May to more than 32%.

The government organs, military units, schools, and factories in Beijing have universally begun to actively develop non-staple food production based on the specific conditions of their units. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company has planted more than 300 mu of vegetables, raised more than 200 pigs, and raised more than 5,000 chickens.

### 力争做到自力更生为主外援为辅  北京市大搞副食品生产

    力争做到自力更生为主外援为辅
    北京市大搞副食品生产
    新华社11日讯　一个群众性的大搞副食品生产的运动，已经在北京市开展起来。北京各国营农、牧场、郊区人民公社，公社社员和机关、部队、学校各路副食品生产大军，在商业部门大力支持和配合下，正鼓足干劲、抓紧时机、因地制宜地发展蔬菜、牛奶和猪、鸡、鸭、鱼、兔等生产。
    现在，近郊区各人民公社和国营农场生产的西红柿、茄子、黄瓜等三十多种新鲜蔬菜已经陆续成熟供应市场，每天正常上市量达四百多万斤，城市每人每天平均能吃上一斤多菜。由于生产旺季已经到来，蔬菜供应量正在逐渐增多。北京市商业部门和有些人民公社正在有计划地贮藏和加工一部分蔬菜，弥补淡季供应。牛奶生产目前虽然处在夏季，每天供应市场奶量仍然达十万多磅，比去年同期增加了23.5％。家畜、家禽生产在认真贯彻执行公养和私养并重的方针以后，也有很大发展。
    随着城市建设的飞跃发展，城市就业人口增加，去年农村公社化和生产大跃进以来，广大郊区农民对副食品的需要量也日渐增多。为了适应这个新形势，中共北京市委和各级党组织十分重视搞好副食品生产和供应工作。近几年来，郊区逐步建立了蔬菜和畜牧业生产基地，蔬菜和牛奶的产量不断增加。1952年，城市每人每天平均吃菜零点五三斤，几年来城市人口虽然有很大增加，但是去年每人每天平均吃菜量却增加到零点八一斤。为了大力发展生产，去年郊区蔬菜种植面积达到五十五万多亩，比1949年解放初期扩大了七倍半，总产量增加十四倍以上。今年，郊区蔬菜种植面积还要比去年增加一倍多，如果没有特大自然灾害，蔬菜供应将可得到保证。
    由于建立了乳牛生产基地，牛奶产量也增加很快。解放初期奶牛还不到两千头，牛奶产量和质量都很低。1952年以后，陆续在郊区国营农场建立了三个主要的乳牛生产基地，采取农牧结合、建立饲料基地、培育健康牛群和高产牛群等方法，使乳牛生产迅速发展。目前，各国营农场共有乳牛一万一千多头，其中成乳牛五千多头；今年上半年产奶量达两千多万斤，比去年同期增加了五百多万斤，基本上满足了全市医院、疗养院、托儿所、大饭店、食品业和一部分居民的需要。
    北京市肉类、蛋品和水产的供应，历来主要依靠外地调拨。战斗在副食品生产战线上的各路大军，正在积极发展这方面的生产，力争做到自力更生为主、外援为辅。现在郊区的五千二百多个集体猪场和许多集体鸡场、鸭场、养鱼场，已经形成了进一步发展副食品生产的基地。郊区各公社普遍拨给社员饲料地和贯彻执行收购生猪以后给农民留肉留油政策以后，社员养猪、养鸡的积极性大为高涨，据6月底统计，社员私人养猪占全市养猪数量的比例，已经从5月底的27％增加到32％以上。
    北京市的机关、部队、学校、工厂，已经普遍根据本单位具体情况，积极地着手发展副食品生产。石景山钢铁公司已经种菜三百多亩，养猪二百多头，养鸡五千多只。
