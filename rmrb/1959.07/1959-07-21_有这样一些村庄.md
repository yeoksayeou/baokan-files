    These are Some Villages
    Vietnam　Pan Chunxia

    There are some villages, separated by a river. The beautiful scenery of the ten-year resistance war: sending cassava and sharing rations, fighting the enemy day and night on both the north and south banks, joyfully sharing the sinking of enemy boats. Enemy corpses appear on the beach in the morning, and we sing and dance hand in hand in the evening. Meals consist only of shrimp and chili peppers, and the aroma of cigarettes lingers…

    Today, these are still the same villages, but they present a different picture. A ferry boat can cross, but it has become like a chasm. The land is torn in two, and looking at the opposite bank fills the heart with sorrow…Dense barracks and bunkers, where did these unfamiliar places come from?

    Yongsong, Bianhai, Yongguang…Yongshan, Songlv, Yongjiang…Separated for five years. The sun bakes the sand, and the heart feels like it is being cut, leaving wounds! These five years are like a century each day!

    The flagpole stands tall on the north bank, and the golden star red flag flutters in the wind, telling the good brothers in the south that the densely planted rice fills the barns. In the Yongjin cooperative, the harvest is a beautiful scene. Under the moonlight, we spread out cool mats, drink green tea, and chat about family matters.

    The weather forecast from Songmen River spreads good news to loved ones:
  “The weather is clear today, and boats can leave the port…”

    The news reaches the south bank, reaching the villages along the river. Every word brings warmth, and every word strengthens confidence. Hatred erupts from the pain, and a loyal heart is as firm as steel. Every hill is a volcano, spewing magma at the enemy. Burn their bodies clean and let the rivers and land heal the wounds.

    There are some villages that make you think…A short distance away, yet separated for five years, hearts closely connected, never separated. Singing together for the construction of a new life, rejoicing together in the farms and rice paddies…

    有这样一些村庄
    越南　潘春辖有这样一些村庄，彼此相隔一条江。十年抗战好景色：送块木薯分点粮，夜夜杀敌南北岸，击沉敌艇乐共享。早晨沙滩现敌尸，晚上携手同欢唱，进餐只有虾和椒，烟卷儿缭绕飘香……今天仍是这些村庄，彼此是不同的景象。一摆渡船就能过，却变成鸿沟一样。河山被撕成两半，眼望对岸心惆怅……密密的兵营和碉堡，哪儿来的陌生地方？永松、边海、永光……永山、松律、永江……被分割了五年时光。太阳晒得沙地烫，心如刀割留创伤！五年的岁月呀，一天像一世纪那般长！北岸旗杆高高立，金星红旗随风扬，告诉南方好兄弟，密植的稻子堆满仓，永金合作社里，丰收一片好风光，月下铺开凉席，饮着绿茶谈家常。松门江的天气预报，传开喜讯报告亲人：
  “今天天气晴朗，船儿可以离港……”消息传到江南岸，传到沿江的村庄，每一句话给人温暖，每一句话使信心加强。痛苦里迸发憎恨丹心铁志坚如钢。每一个山丘是座火山，岩浆向敌人喷放。把他们的尸体烧干净，让江河大地医好创伤。有这样一些村庄，叫人左思右想……咫尺天涯五年整，心心相印不离分，为建设新生活同声高歌，在农场稻田里同欢畅……
