To create favorable conditions for high-quality and high-yield silk, Zhejiang Province is promoting a complete set of operational experiences.

    (Report from our newspaper) Zhejiang Province, known as the home of silk, has summarized a complete set of silk production operations. This set of operations includes four aspects: silk reeling, re-reeling, winding, and silk weaving, totaling thirty-eight advanced operational experiences.

    Zhejiang Province's silk industry has great production potential: the technical level of workers varies, and the effective utilization rate of machinery in silk weaving factories differs by as much as 30%; if the average effective utilization rate of machinery in all silk factories is increased to 90%, the annual output of silk fabrics can be increased by 8.4 million meters.

    Based on this situation, the leading departments of Zhejiang Province's silk industry convened a competition for advanced operations among silk reeling workers, and invited advanced workers from fraternal silk factories in Jiangsu, Shanghai, Shandong, Xinjiang, and other regions to participate in demonstrations. From this advanced operation competition, twelve advanced silk reeling operation experiences and five advanced re-reeling operation experiences were summarized. At the provincial silk industry conference, fifteen advanced silk weaving operation experiences and six advanced winding operation experiences were summarized.

    This set of advanced silk operation experiences has been推广 [推广 means promote, spread, popularize] to silk factories throughout the province. After Hangzhou Hongfeng Silk Factory推广 [推广 means promote, spread, popularize] these experiences, the qualification rate of silk fabrics in April increased from the original 90% to 99.8%. Chen Linghua, a loom apprentice at Hangzhou Silk Factory, eliminated substandard products after learning the operational experience of plain looms. In June, the city's silk fabric qualification rate increased by 1.93% compared to the same period last year, with fourteen silk factories averaging above 99%.

    While推广 [推广 means promote, spread, popularize] advanced experience, various factories have also推广 [推广 means promote, spread, popularize] advanced equipment and devices, enabling advanced operational experience to have a greater effect. (Su Lieshan, Dong Minzhi)

    为丝绸优质高产创造有利条件
    浙江推广整套操作经验
    本报讯　素称丝绸故乡的浙江省的丝绸工业，已经总结出一套完整的丝绸生产操作法。这套操作法，包括缫丝、复摇、摇纡、织绸等四个方面，三十八项先进操作经验。
    浙江省丝绸工业生产潜力很大：工人的技术水平有高有低，丝织厂的机械有效利用率最高和最低相差30％左右；如果把所有丝绸厂机械的有效利用率平均提高到90％，全年就可以增产绸缎八百四十万米。
    根据这一情况，浙江省丝绸工业领导部门召开了缫丝工人的比先进操作竞赛，并且邀请了江苏、上海、山东、新疆等各兄弟缫丝厂的先进工作者参加表演。从这次先进操作竞赛中，总结了十二项先进缫丝操作经验，五项先进复摇操作经验。在全省丝绸工业会议上，又总结了十五项先进织绸操作经验、六项先进摇纡操作经验。
    这一套丝绸先进操作经验，已经推广到全省各个丝绸厂。杭州洪峰绸厂推广了这些经验，4月份绸缎正品率从原来的90％提高到99.8％。杭州丝绸厂挡车学徒工陈玲华，学习了素机的操作经验以后，消灭了次货。6月份，全市绸缎正品率比去年同期提高1.93％，有十四家丝绸厂平均达到99％以上。
    各厂在推广先进经验的同时，还推广了先进设备装置，使先进操作经验能够发挥更大的效果。　（苏烈山、董敏之）
