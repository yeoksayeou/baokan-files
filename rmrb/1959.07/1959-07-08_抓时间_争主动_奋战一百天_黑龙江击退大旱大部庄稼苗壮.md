Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 7th: Nine million farmers in Heilongjiang Province have been fighting the drought for seedlings for over one hundred days, and have finally repelled the drought and planted good crops.

At present, most of the one hundred million mu of cultivated land in Heilongjiang Province have full and strong seedlings, with thick roots and lush leaves. Wheat is beginning to head, and soybeans are about to blossom. Only a small portion of the cultivated land is missing seedlings, which has already been replanted. Farmers throughout the province are conducting the second and third rounds of inter-row cultivation and weeding for field crops. The broad masses of farmers are full of confidence in winning a bumper harvest this year.

Since last autumn, Heilongjiang Province has had little rainfall, little snow in winter, and little rain in spring. Many old farmers have said that this is the worst drought they have ever seen. As early as February this year, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the instruction "Seize Time, Strive for Initiative, Fight Spring Drought, Protect Spring Planting" to farmers throughout the province, requiring people's communes to "prioritize water and combine water and fertilizer." Anti-drought headquarters were established at the provincial, special district, and county levels, and anti-drought command posts were established in the people's communes. A sustained anti-drought struggle has unfolded throughout the province.

This spring, the people's communes in Heilongjiang began to prepare the land before it was completely thawed, generally carrying out harrowing, leveling, and compacting, to finely harrow and compact the soil, so that the moisture frozen in the soil could be well preserved. Many counties also transported ice from rivers, ditches, ponds, and springs to the fields; some transported urine-ice, which both combated drought and increased fertilizer. For tall crops such as sorghum and corn, the method of planting seeds with water and applying fertilizer with water was adopted. After the seeds were sown, the broad masses of farmers actively used existing water conservancy irrigation projects. From the autumn harvest last year to the spring plowing this year, Heilongjiang Province constructed more than 3,500 small and medium-sized reservoirs, dug more than 40,000 wells and springs, and built 812 gravity irrigation projects. These projects have all played a role in spring irrigation.

Recently, rainfall has been falling continuously in various parts of Heilongjiang Province, but the broad masses of farmers are not complacent and self-satisfied because of this, and are still shoveling and tilling as they go. At the same time, they are beginning to prepare for flood prevention.

### 抓时间　争主动　奋战一百天  黑龙江击退大旱大部庄稼苗壮

    抓时间　争主动　奋战一百天
    黑龙江击退大旱大部庄稼苗壮
    据新华社哈尔滨7日电　黑龙江省九百万农民和旱灾争苗，奋战一百多天，终于击退旱象，种出了很好的庄稼。
    目前黑龙江省一亿亩耕地绝大部分苗全苗壮，根粗叶肥，小麦开始出穗，大豆即将扬花；只有一少部分耕地缺苗，也已经进行了补种。全省各地农民正为大田作物进行第二遍和第三遍的中耕除草，广大农民满怀信心要夺得今年的丰收。
    黑龙江省自从去年入秋以后雨量就少，冬季少雪，春季少雨。许多老农，都反映这是从未见过的大旱。中共黑龙江省委早在今年2月就向全省农民发出了“抢时间，争主动，抗春旱，保春种”的指示，要求人民公社“以水领先，水肥并举”。省、专区、县三级普遍成立了抗旱指挥部，各人民公社成立了抗旱指挥所，一场持久的抗旱斗争便在全省展开。
    黑龙江各地人民公社在今年春天，没等土地完全解冻，就动手整地，普遍进行了耙、耢和镇压，耙细、压实，使冻在土壤里的水分得到了很好的保持；很多县还从河、沟、泡、泉往地里运送冰块；有的运送尿冰，既抗旱，又增肥；而对高粱、苞米等高棵作物，则采取了坐水下种、坐水施肥的办法。在种子下地以后，广大农民又积极利用现有的水利灌溉工程。黑龙江省从去年秋收以后到今年春耕以前，兴修的水利工程计有中小型水库三千五百多座，打井开泉四万多眼，自流灌溉工程八百一十二处。这些工程都对春灌起了作用。
    最近黑龙江全省各地已陆续降雨，但是广大农民群众并不为此而麻痹自满，仍在随铲随趟。与此同时，并开始准备防涝。
