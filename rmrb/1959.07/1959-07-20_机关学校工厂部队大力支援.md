Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 19th: Fujian Province is in the midst of a major early rice harvest. On the fields after the initial wind and rain, two to three million laborers are currently being投入every day for the summer harvest. Nearly one-third of the province's early rice has been brought in. Longxi and Xiamen areas, which started harvesting first, have already harvested over 60%. Jinjiang Special District has completed harvesting over half of its area. The busy harvest season has also started successively in western Fujian, northern Fujian, and eastern Fujian, where the season is later.

This year, the seven million mu of early rice in Fujian generally grew well. To ensure harvesting as soon as it ripens and prevent losses from typhoons and rainstorms, all localities made full preparations before the summer harvest. For example, Tongan, Haicheng, and Longxi counties concentrated over 100,000 laborers to rush the harvest. In less than half a month, they basically completed the harvesting of over 400,000 mu of early rice.

All localities have launched competitions focused on tool reform and quick harvesting, quick threshing, careful threshing, and detailed collection. In the competition, Changtai and Longxi counties harvested an extra 10 to 20 jin of rice per mu.

    据新华社福州19日电　福建省早稻收割大忙。在风雨初霁的田野上，目前每天投入夏收的劳动力有两三百万人。全省近三分之一的早稻已经登场。最先收割的龙溪、厦门地区已经收了六成多。晋江专区收割面积已超过一半。季节迟的闽西、闽北和闽东地区收割大忙也陆续开始了。
    今年，福建七百多万亩早稻一般生长良好，为了作到随熟随割，防止暴风雨侵袭损失，各地夏收前都作了充分准备，光同安、海澄、龙溪三县集中十多万个劳力抢收后，不到半个月，就基本完成了四十多万亩早稻的收割工作。
    各地展开了以工具改革和快收快打、精打细收为中心的竞赛。长泰、龙溪两县在竞赛中，每亩多收稻谷一、二十斤。
