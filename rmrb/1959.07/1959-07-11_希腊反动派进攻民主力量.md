    Greek Reactionaries Attack Democratic Forces
    Greece　Lai·Sitelingguosi
    Greece is currently in a period of reactionary offensive. This offensive began after the left-wing democratic forces achieved a major victory in the May 11, 1958 election. Now, with the arrest and trial of Manolis Glezos, a hero of the national resistance movement, the organizational secretary of the Left-Wing Democratic Alliance, and the editor of the "Dawn Daily," a large-scale persecution of activists and supporters of the Left-Wing Democratic Alliance has begun. The anti-democratic crusade is at its most rampant.
    What are the reasons for this offensive and what are its goals?

    Under the Enslavement of US Imperialists
    It has been fourteen years since British imperialism stopped the democratic development of our country with blatant armed intervention and put the royalist fascist reactionaries in power. During this period, the Greek people have suffered greatly due to the successive "aid" – armed intervention – of Britain and the United States. Greece's economic and political dependence on US imperialists has turned our country into a base and bridgehead against the socialist camp and the national liberation movements of the peoples of the Middle East. Relying on the Greek government, state organs, and many major economic sectors they occupy, which are subservient to them, US imperialists use various "aid" methods to benefit themselves. They force our country to accept enslaving "agreements," allowing the United States to arbitrarily control our country's territory, transportation, ports, airports, and military. In short, US imperialists, like masters, arrange our national economy, command our armed forces, and guide our foreign policy according to their own aggressive interests.
    Greece remains an underdeveloped and backward agricultural country. Its economic structure has not undergone any major changes. The three billion dollars of "aid" touted by the Americans has mostly been used to organize civil wars, to allow US monopoly capital to enslave our country, or to be plundered by financial oligarchs. Even government organs have to admit that almost no important infrastructure projects have been carried out in recent years. Not only has there been no major improvement in the economy, but in some respects, it has even worsened.
    The intensified intrusion of American financial capital and subsequently West German financial capital has resulted in the plunder of our country's wealth. Greece possesses abundant raw material resources, but feels a shortage of raw materials because they are plundered by foreign monopoly capital that hinders our country's industrial development.
    The Karamanlis government obediently implements Washington's policies and is preparing to set up missile bases in Greece. The people are also extremely concerned that the governments of Greece and Italy, following the instructions of the US State Department, will try to establish a Turkish, Greek, and Italian triangular alliance within the scope of NATO to oppose the national liberation movements in the Middle East.
    Therefore, the entire post-war development of the country has made the contradictions between foreign monopoly capital and the local oligarchs who cooperate closely with it, and the broad masses of the people, including the national bourgeoisie, more acute.

    The Growth of People's Resistance
    The Greek people, well-trained by the national resistance movement and having suffered the hardships of fourteen years of British armed intervention and American guardianship, will never yield. They are strengthening their struggle every day. Since 1956, the workers' movement and the democratic movement have been rising continuously. The number of people participating in strikes increased from 150,000 in 1955 to 320,000 in 1956, and to 500,000 in 1957. In the May 11, 1958 election, the Left-Wing Democratic Alliance won nearly one million votes and became the main opposition party. This was a failure of the US policy towards Greece and a major victory for the democratic forces. This election showed that the majority of the working class, most of the peasants, and the middle class firmly support democratic reforms at home.
    In recent times, the anti-American sentiment of the working people and a section of the bourgeoisie has been growing. This can be seen from the parliamentary elections: the vast majority of the people actually voted against the establishment of atomic and rocket bases in Greece.
    Major changes have also taken place among those who support the pro-democracy middle parties. In the parliamentary elections, these parties refused the proposal made by the Left-Wing Democratic Alliance to cooperate on the basis of a minimum program, that is, on the basis of striving for peace and democracy at home. If such cooperation had been realized, Karamanlis would not be in power now, and the country would have taken a big step towards democratization. Due to the rejection of the Left-Wing Democratic Alliance's proposal, the pro-democracy middle parties suffered a serious defeat in the election.
    Both the right wing and the seemingly solid Karamanlis government are losing influence among the people. Their policies on all domestic life issues have failed.
    Even some conservatives have expressed dissatisfaction and sometimes directly opposed the government. Propaganda that incites hatred, prejudice, and national division is receiving less and less response among those who support the government, while the spirit of national unity is strengthening day by day, and the Communist Party is the standard-bearer of national unity. In the May 11, 1958 election, some very telling things happened: some leaders of the right-wing armed forces who were originally opposed to the people's democratic movement expressed solidarity with the people's democratic movement and even sought to contact and cooperate with the democratic movement.
    These changes are closely related to the great achievements of the socialist camp, the collapse of the colonial system, the development of national liberation struggles in colonies and dependent countries, and the people's resistance to the war policy.
        The Threat of Fascism
    The current goal of the reactionary offensive is to stop the growing democratic movement. The ruling groups of monopoly capital, headed by the National Radical Union (the ruling party in Greece) and the government subservient to the Americans, are trying to get rid of their difficult situation. They are doing everything possible to shift the burden of the crisis onto the laborers.
    The immediate goal of the reactionaries is to defeat the Left-Wing Democratic Alliance, isolate it from the broad mass organizations, from trade unions, cooperatives, associations, local autonomous organ committees, and village committees, and turn it into an ineffective group confined to the parliament, because in the parliament, the right-wing forces can achieve absolute dominance by relying on a fabricated election system. This well-calculated conspiracy has been confirmed by many facts. For example, incidents of arresting activists of the Left-Wing Democratic Alliance are constantly occurring and expanding in scale; the barbaric system of exiling many people's fighters to isolated islands without trial for eleven or twelve years is not only maintained but also expanding; the use of Law No. 375 to oppose left-wing elements, which stipulates that citizens who engage in "espionage" during peacetime are tried by military courts; a series of extraordinary measures have been implemented, such as laws prohibiting the activities of the Communist Party and some democratic organizations, laws restricting freedom of the press, the "loyalty guarantee" system, etc.; the medieval barbaric method of offering rewards for capturing "criminals" has been implemented; provocations against the Left-Wing Democratic Alliance are carried out, attacking the Alliance's locations and setting fire to these places; dismissing those who have been elected by the working people to the leading organs of trade unions, cooperatives, local autonomous organs, and village committees; and long-term suspension of parliamentary activities, etc. The arrest of Manolis Glezos and the submission of his case to a military court on the basis of fabricated espionage charges is the most frantic offensive by the reactionaries. Although this offensive is currently mainly directed at the left-wing democratic forces, it is threatening all democratic forces, so if this offensive is not repelled, no democratic achievements can be ensured.
    In Greece, the reactionary right-wing camp is not stronger. On the contrary, the right wing's influence has been somewhat limited, a crisis has occurred in the middle parties, and the strength of the left wing has strengthened. The current situation in Greece has the following characteristic: the reactionary offensive has caused a serious protest movement, in which a large number of people, as well as many social activists, political activists, lawyers, and people from the scientific and cultural circles, are participating. Almost all opposition parties—the Labor People's Democratic Party, the National Center Progressive Union, the Democratic Alliance, the People's Social Party, the New Farmers' Party, a section of the Liberals, and the leaders of the Labor and Farmers Party—oppose the policies implemented by the right-wing forces and demand the abolition of Law No. 375, the cessation of illegal exiles by administrative organs, and the submission of so-called espionage cases to civil courts.
    Of course, it would be wrong to underestimate the danger of fascism and ignore the shortcomings of the democratic movement.

          Defending Democratic Freedoms
    The development of Greek society as a whole, especially during the war and post-war periods, shows that the financial oligarchs place their own class interests above the national interests of their country. The financial oligarchs abandoned the ideals of the country and betrayed democracy. Due to historical necessity, the working class and its Communist Party have become the standard-bearers and advanced fighters in the struggle for the constitutional democratic freedoms and institutions that have been abandoned by the bourgeoisie. This is the significance of the various changes in Greece and the historic struggle between progressive and reactionary forces.
    The Communist Party firmly believes that, despite the many difficulties and obstacles created by the reactionaries to hinder the activities of the opposition, this program can be realized through peaceful means as long as all progressives are united into a strong anti-imperialist democratic front.
    The Greek people are waging an arduous and fierce struggle to defend democratic freedoms, strive for survival, and strive for peace and independence. The movement to save Manolis Glezos is part of this struggle. The Greek people are deeply convinced that they can pave the way for the restoration of democracy and normal life, and pave the way for peace, democracy, and independence in Greece.

    希腊反动派进攻民主力量
    希腊　莱·斯特林果斯
    目前希腊正处在反动派进攻时期。这次进攻是在1958年5月11日选举时左翼民主力量取得重大胜利之后展开的。现在，随着民族抵抗运动的英雄、左翼民主联盟的组织书记和“黎明日报”的编辑曼诺里斯·格列索斯的被捕和受审判，开始了对左翼民主联盟的活动家和拥护者的大规模迫害。反民主的十字军正处在最猖獗的时候。
    造成这次进攻的原因和这次进攻的目的何在呢？
    在美帝国主义者的奴役下
    自从英帝国主义用无耻的武装干涉制止了我国的民主发展，并使保皇法西斯反动派当权以来，已经十四年了。在这个时期内，由于英国和美国先后的“援助”——武装干涉，希腊人民感到很大痛苦。希腊在经济和政治上对美帝国主义者的依赖，使我国变成了反对社会主义阵营各国和中近东各国人民民族解放运动的基地和桥头堡。美帝国主义者依靠在他们面前卑躬屈膝的希腊政府、国家机关和他们所占领的许多主要经济部门，利用种种“援助”办法来为自己谋利益。他们强迫我国接受奴役性的“协定”，使我们祖国的领土、交通工具、港口、机场、军队都由美国任意支配。总而言之，美帝国主义者像主人一样，按照自己的侵略利益来安排我国的国民经济，指挥我国的武装力量，指导我国的外交政策。
    希腊现在仍然是一个不发达的落后的农业国家。它的经济结构没有什么重大的变化。美国人大肆吹嘘的三十亿美元的“援助”，大部分被用来组织内战，用来使美国垄断资本奴役我国，或者是被金融寡头侵吞。连政府机关也不得不承认，最近几年来几乎没有进行过任何一项重要的基本建设。在经济上不但没有什么重大的改善，而且在某些方面反而更糟了。
    美国财政资本和随后而来的西德财政资本的加紧侵入，造成了对我国财富的掠夺。希腊拥有丰富的原料资源，却感到原料不足，因为原料都被阻碍我国工业发展的外国垄断资本掠夺去了。
    卡拉曼利斯政府驯顺地执行华盛顿的政策，准备在希腊设置火箭基地。人民还极其担心希腊和意大利的政府会按照美国国务院的指示设法建立在北大西洋范围内的土耳其、希腊和意大利的三角同盟，来反对中近东的民族解放运动。
    因此，国家整个战后时期的发展，使得外国垄断资本及与它密切合作的地方寡头同包括民族资产阶级在内的广大人民之间的矛盾更加尖锐了。
    人民反抗力量在增长
    希腊人民受过民族抵抗运动的良好锻炼，又饱尝十四年英国武装干涉和美国监护的苦果，他们决不会屈服。他们每天都在加强自己的斗争。从1956年起，工人运动和民主运动不断地高涨。参加罢工的人数1955年是十五万，1956年增加到三十二万，而1957年增加到五十万。在1958年5月11日的选举中，左翼民主联盟获得了将近一百万张选票，成了主要的反对党，这是美国对希腊政策的失败，是民主力量的重大胜利。这次选举表明，大多数工人阶级、大部分农民和中间阶层都坚决拥护在国内实行民主改革。
    最近时期，劳动人民以及一部分资产阶级的反美情绪在日益增长。这一点从议会选举中可以看出：绝大部分人民实际上都投票反对在希腊设置原子和火箭基地。
    支持民主主义中派各政党的人们中间也发生了重大变化。在议会选举当中，这些党曾拒绝左翼民主联盟提出的在最低纲领的基础上，即在争取国内的和平和民主的基础上实行合作的建议，假如这种合作实现了，现在就不会是卡拉曼利斯执政了，国家就会向民主化方面前进一大步。由于拒绝左翼民主联盟的建议，民主主义中派各政党在选举中遭到了严重的失败。
    无论是右翼，或者是表面上看来很稳固的卡拉曼利斯政府，在人民当中都在日益丧失影响。它们在一切国内生活问题上的政策都破产了。
    甚至一部分保守派也表现了不满，有时还直接反对政府。煽动仇视、偏见和民族分裂的宣传在支持政府的人们中间得到的响应愈来愈少，而民族团结的精神日益加强，民族团结的旗手就是共产党。在1958年5月11日的选举中曾发生这样一些很能说明问题的事情：某些原来反对人民民主运动的右翼武装部队的首领表示和人民民主运动一条心，甚至力求同民主运动接触和合作。
    这些变化是同社会主义阵营的巨大成就、同殖民体系的崩溃过程、同殖民地和附属国中的民族解放斗争的发展以及同人民对战争政策的反抗有密切联系的。
        法西斯的威胁
    反动派目前进攻的目的就是制止日益发展的民主运动。以国民激进联盟（希腊的执政党）和在美国人面前卑躬屈膝的政府为首的垄断资本统治集团竭力想摆脱困难的处境。他们千方百计地企图把危机的重担转嫁到劳动者的身上。
    反动派当前的直接目的是击溃左翼民主联盟，使它同广大的群众组织，同工会、合作社、协会、地方自治机关委员会和村社委员会隔绝，使它成为局限在议会中的不起作用的集团，因为在议会中，右翼势力依靠伪造的选举制度能够取得绝对的统治地位。这个颇有算计的阴谋已被许多事实证实了。例如，逮捕左翼民主联盟的积极分子的事件不断发生，规模日益扩大；把许多人民战士放逐孤岛而在十一二年内不加以审讯，这种野蛮的制度不但保持着，而且范围日益扩大；使用第375号法律来反对左翼分子，这个法律规定：公民在和平时期进行“间谍活动”即由军事法庭审讯；一系列非常措施一直在实行着，如禁止共产党和一些民主组织活动的法律，限制出版自由的法律，“忠诚保证书”制度等等；实施了悬赏捕捉“罪犯”的中世纪的野蛮办法；对左翼民主联盟进行挑衅，袭击联盟的所在地，并放火焚烧这些场所；解雇那些被劳动人民选入工会、合作社、地方自治机关和村社的领导机构的人；长期停止议会活动等等。逮捕曼诺里斯·格列索斯，并根据捏造的间谍罪把他的案件提交给军事法庭，这是反动派最疯狂的一次进攻。这个进攻虽然在目前来说主要的矛头是指向左翼的民主力量，但它在威胁着所有的民主力量，所以如果不击退这个进攻，任何的民主成果都不能确保无虞。
    在希腊，反动的右翼阵营不是强大了，相反地，右翼的影响受到了某些限制，中派发生了危机，而左翼的力量加强了。目前希腊的情况有这样一个特点：反动派的进攻引起严重的抗议运动，参加抗议运动的有广大的人民群众，还有许多社会活动家、政治活动家、律师、科学界和文化界人士。几乎一切反对党——劳动人民民主党、全国中派进步联盟、民主联盟、人民社会党、新农民党、一部分自由党人以及劳农党的领导人——都反对右翼势力所执行的政策，要求废除第375号法律，停止行政机构非法的放逐，把所谓间谍案交由民事法庭审讯。
    当然，如果过低估计法西斯主义的危险，忽视民主运动的缺点，那是错误的。
          捍卫民主自由
    希腊整个社会的发展，特别在战时和战后的发展表明，金融寡头是把自己的阶级利益置于本国民族利益之上的。金融寡头背弃了国家的理想，背叛了民主制。工人阶级和它的共产党由于历史的必然性，而成了争取被资产阶级所抛弃了的立宪的民主自由权利和制度的旗手和先进战士。这就是希腊的种种变化以及进步力量同反动力量之间所进行的历史性斗争的意义。
    共产党坚决相信，尽管反动派制造了重重困难和障碍来阻挠反对派的活动，但是只要把一切进步分子结成一个强大的反帝的民主战线，这一纲领是能够通过和平的途径实现的。
    希腊人民正在为捍卫民主自由，争取生存，争取和平和独立而进行艰巨而激烈的斗争。拯救曼诺里斯·格列索斯的运动就是这个斗争的一部分。希腊人民深信，他们能够为恢复民主制度和正常生活开辟道路，为争取希腊的和平、民主和独立开辟道路。
