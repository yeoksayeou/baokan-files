US Monopoly Capital's Insatiable Exploitation
Bolivian Oil Plundered

    This paper reports that the Bolivian "Youth Publishing Company" recently published a book written by Almaraz, "Bolivian Oil," exposing the exploitation of Bolivian oil by American oil monopoly capital.
    The author writes that the Bolivian ruling clique handed over their oil resources to foreign companies as early as 1920. American companies obtained concessions to exploit oil throughout Bolivia's territory. The American "Mobil Oil Company" began to infiltrate Bolivia at this time. Around 1920, the British Petroleum Company also joined the competition for Bolivian oil. However, in 1927, the British "Shell Oil Company" was squeezed out by "Mobil Oil Company."
    In 1936, Bolivia established a national oil enterprise (referring to the "Bolivian Oil Deposits Administration"), but later the national company encountered great difficulties. The oil fields it currently exploits are becoming depleted, and there is insufficient funding and equipment to undertake new exploration work. If new oil deposits with industrial value and shallow burial are not discovered, then in two or three years, the country's oil production will be greatly reduced. An even more serious problem is the loss of vast oil regions.
    The author points out that Bolivia's oil policy is based on handing over oil production areas to foreign capital. In October 1955, the "Petroleum Law" passed by the government of President Paz Estenssoro established conditions for granting concessions that national capital could not meet. The passage of the "Petroleum Law" dealt a fatal blow to measures taken to protect the national economy from the intrusion of foreign monopoly capital. Bolivia's main wealth was handed over to foreign capital free of charge. The "Petroleum Law" was drafted by lawyers from the New York law firm "Chester and Dewinport." Not a single Bolivian participated in the drafting.
    The author exposes how American companies forced Bolivia to relinquish oil concessions in order to plunder oil.
    The American "Gran McCarthy Oil Company" leased 359,700 hectares of land in the area of activity of the Bolivian Oil Deposits Administration; these areas have long been known for their oil wealth. In addition, this company is free to choose the production areas it is more interested in. It does not pay any fees during the entire exploration and exploitation period, and can "establish and use" oil refineries, pipelines, oil storage tanks, docks, highways and railways, telegraph lines, etc. But there is not a single word in the contract about the state being able to use the lessee's equipment.
    The activities of another American company, "Gulf Oil Company," are equally harmful to Bolivia. Two contracts signed by the Bolivian government and the Bolivian Oil Deposits Administration with this company stipulate that the company will provide the Bolivian Oil Deposits Administration with a loan of 5 million US dollars to lay the Sica Sica-Arica oil pipeline; the company will also receive concessions to conduct exploration on land including the operating areas of the Bolivian Oil Deposits Administration. However, the Bolivian Oil Deposits Administration does not need the Sica Sica-Arica oil pipeline because it does not currently have, and will not have in the near future, surplus oil for export to the Pacific coast. The oil transported through this pipeline will be the oil extracted by "Gulf Oil Company" itself.
    The author also points out that the contract signed with "Gulf Oil Company," which stipulates tax exemptions, designates foreign arbitrators, and cancels national control over the lessee's activities, infringes upon national sovereignty. Since the implementation of the "new" oil policy for two years, Bolivia's dependence on American companies has increased.
    The author concludes by writing that the exploitation of Bolivia by American monopoly capital is "a link in the overall policy of eliminating Bolivia's national independence. The process of Bolivia losing its national independence has accelerated recently. Therefore, establishing an independent oil industry and ending the plunder of Bolivia's national oil resources by American monopoly capital will greatly help consolidate the country's independence."

### 美国垄断资本榨取无餍  玻利维亚石油惨遭掠夺

    美国垄断资本榨取无餍
    玻利维亚石油惨遭掠夺
    本报讯　玻利维亚“青少年出版公司”不久前出版了阿尔马拉斯写的“玻利维亚的石油”一书，揭露了美国石油垄断资本掠夺玻利维亚石油的情况。
    作者写道，玻利维亚统治集团早在1920年就把自己的石油包给外国公司了。美国公司在玻利维亚的整个领土上取得了开采石油的租让权。美国的“美孚油公司”正是在这个时候开始渗入玻利维亚的。大概在1920年的时候，英国石油公司也加入了争夺玻利维亚石油的角逐。但是在1927年的时候，英国的“英荷壳牌石油公司”便被“美孚油公司”排挤出去了。
    1936年玻利维亚成立了国家石油企业（指“玻利维亚石油矿藏管理局”），然而后来国家公司便遇到了很大的困难。目前它所开采的石油区的石油正在枯竭，而要想从事新的勘探工作，则资金和设备都不足，如果不勘探出具有工业价值和埋藏不深的新石油矿的话，那末在两、三年以后，国家的石油产量将大大减少。比这更严重得多的问题是广大石油区的丧失。
    作者指出，玻利维亚的石油政策是建立在把石油产地交给外国资本的基础上的。1955年10月，帕斯·埃斯登索罗总统政府通过的“石油法”，确立了一种给予租让权的条件，而这种条件是民族资本所无法做到的。“石油法”的通过给那些为保护国家经济不让外国垄断资本掺入而采取的措施，带来了致命的打击。玻利维亚的主要财富无偿地到了外国资本的手里。“石油法”是由纽约“彻斯特和德温港”律师事务所的律师起草的。在起草时没有一个玻利维亚人参加。
    作者揭露了美国公司为了掠夺石油迫使玻利维亚出让石油租让权的情形。
    美国“格兰·麦卡锡石油公司”在玻利维亚石油矿藏管理局的活动地区承租了三十五万九千七百公顷的土地；这些地区是很早以来就以石油财富著称的地区。此外，这家公司还可以自由地挑选它更加感到兴趣的产地。它在整个勘探和开采时期不缴纳任何款项，可以“建立和使用”炼油厂、油管、储油器、码头、公路和铁路、电报线等等。但在合同上没有一个字谈到国家可以利用承租者的设备。
    另一家美国公司“海湾石油公司”的活动，对于玻利维亚来说同样是有害的。玻利维亚政府和玻利维亚石油矿藏管理局同这家公司订的两个合同，规定公司向玻利维亚石油矿藏管理局提供五百万美元的贷款，以敷设西卡西卡—亚里加油管；公司还得到租让权，可以在包括玻利维亚石油矿藏管理局经营地区在内的土地上进行勘探。但玻利维亚石油矿藏管理局并不需要西卡西卡—亚里加油管，因为它现在没有，在最近的将来也不会有多余的石油向太平洋沿岸出口。通过这条油管运送的将是“海湾石油公司”自己开采出来的石油。
    作者还指出，同“海湾石油公司”所签订的规定免交捐税的合同、指定外国仲裁者、取消国家对承租者的活动的控制等等，都侵害了国家主权。“新”石油政策执行两年以来，玻利维亚对美国公司的依赖性加大了。
    作者最后写道，美国垄断资本对玻利维亚的掠夺，是“消除玻利维亚民族独立总政策的一个环节。玻利维亚丧失民族独立的过程最近以来更为加速了。因此，建立独立的石油工业，结束美国垄断资本对玻利维亚国家石油资源的掠夺，这将大大有助于巩固国家的独立。
