Due to historically created ethnic prejudices, many people see Inner Mongolia as a desolate place. When Inner Mongolia is mentioned, they think of the old song that has been passed down since the Northern Qi Dynasty: "The sky is vast, the fields are boundless, the wind blows the grass low to see cattle and sheep." In fact, this land on the border of the motherland is not only magnificent in its mountains and rivers, and fertile in its land, but also possesses infinitely rich material resources. It is a great base for China to develop modern steel industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry industry. Only under the leadership of the Party, with the concerted efforts of all ethnic groups, can these resources be gradually utilized.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has a land area of ​​approximately 1.4 million square kilometers. It is inhabited by 19 ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Han, Manchu, Daur, Ewenki, Oroqen, Korean, and Tibetan. It is the earliest autonomous region in the country with Mongolians as the main body. The entire region extends more than 2,000 kilometers from east to southwest, forming a vast and narrow strip. The vast majority is a plateau with an altitude of about 1,000 meters. The Greater Khingan Mountains run through the eastern region, and the Yin Mountains traverse the western region, forming the edge of the Mongolian Plateau. The main rivers in the territory include the Yellow River, the Xiliao River, the Nen River, and the Ergun River. Many large areas of plains are spread throughout the region.

Through the exploration of geological workers in recent years, it has been proved that Inner Mongolia is extremely rich in mineral resources. The nationally renowned Baiyun Obo Iron Mine has become the raw material base for the Baotou Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, one of China's three major steel industry bases. Chromite, which is urgently needed by the country, has also been found here. Coal reserves are also very large. The proven coal reserves in Zhuozi Mountain, Wuda and other places alone rank second in the country. In addition, the region also has copper, oil shale, lead-zinc, gold, mica, asbestos, crystal and other mineral deposits. Since the implementation of regional autonomy, backbone industries such as metallurgy, machinery, electric power, petroleum, and chemicals have been initially established. Various factories have been built in some mountainous and forest areas and grasslands that originally had only a small amount of handicraft industry or no industry at all. Employees from all over the country are also enthusiastically carrying out various construction undertakings together with the people of all ethnic groups in the region.

From the Greater Khingan Mountains to the Helan Mountains, the entire region has lush grasslands, fertile farmland, and dense forests. The famous Xilin Gol, Hulunbuir and other pastures produce a large number of livestock, meat, fur, dairy products and various livestock products every year to supply the needs of the country and the people. Hailar, a grassland city in Hulunbuir, has become a major base for China's dairy industry. The output of grain and industrial crops has also increased year by year. Last year, the total grain output of the Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner increased by more than two times compared with 1957. The Oroqen people, who have been engaged in hunting for generations, are developing from a single hunting economy to diversified operations, establishing grain and vegetable bases, developing sideline production, and excellently undertaking the work of protecting the forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains. In various rural and pastoral areas, thousands of wild plants have recently been surveyed, which can be used as raw materials for textile, brewing and other light industries; among them, flax fiber alone can weave six million pieces of cloth every year, which can meet the cloth needs of the entire region. Inner Mongolia's forest area ranks second in the country. In the past year, more than 2 million cubic meters of wood were transported from the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area, which strongly supported the construction of coal mines, railways, water conservancy projects and cities in various places.

    地上地下资源多
    由于历史上造成的民族偏见，不少人把内蒙古看作是荒凉的地方。一提起内蒙古，就会联想到“天苍苍，野茫茫，风吹草低见牛羊”那首从北齐时代流传下来的古老歌谣。事实上，祖国边疆这块土地，不仅山河壮丽，土地肥沃，而且拥有无限丰富的物产资源，是我国发展现代化钢铁工业、农业、畜牧业、森林工业的大好基地。只有在党的领导下，各族人民同心协力，这些资源才逐渐被利用。
    内蒙古自治区土地面积约一百四十多万平方公里，这里居住着蒙、汉、满、达斡尔、鄂温克、鄂伦春、朝鲜、藏等十九个民族，是全国最早成立的以蒙古族为主体的自治区。全区由东向西南延伸两千多公里，形成一个辽阔的狭长地带，绝大部分是海拔一千公尺左右的高原。大兴安岭纵贯东部地区，西部有阴山山脉横贯其间，构成了蒙古高原的边缘。境内主要河流有黄河、西辽河、嫩江、额尔古纳河等，许多大面积平原布满全区。
    经过近年来地质工作者的勘探，证明内蒙古矿藏极为丰富。全国闻名的白云鄂博大铁矿，已经成为我国三大钢铁工业基地之一的包头钢铁联合企业的原料基地。国家迫切需要的铬铁矿，也在这里找到了。煤炭储量也很大，仅桌子山、乌达等处已探清的煤炭埋藏量，已居全国第二位。此外，全区还有铜、油母页岩、铅锌、金、云母、石棉、水晶等矿藏。自实行区域自治以后，已初步建立起冶金、机械、电力、石油、化学等骨干工业。一些原来只有少量手工业或根本没有工业的山林地带和草原，都建起了各种工厂。来自全国各地的职工，也热情地和本区各族人民一道进行各项建设事业。
    从大兴安岭到贺兰山，全区有着丰茂的草原、肥沃的农田和茂密的森林。著名的锡林郭勒、呼伦贝尔等牧场，每年生产出大量的牲畜、肉类、皮毛、乳制品和各种畜产，供应国家和人民需要。呼伦贝尔草原城市海拉尔，已成为我国乳品工业的主要基地。粮食和技术作物的产量也逐年增长。莫力达瓦达斡尔族自治旗，去年粮食总产量比1957年增长了两倍多。世世代代经营猎业的鄂伦春族，正在由单一的狩猎经济向多种经营发展，建立粮食蔬菜基地，开展副业生产，并出色地担负着保护大兴安岭森林的工作。在各个农村、牧区，最近还勘查出上千种野生植物，可作纺织、酿造等轻工业原料；其中胡麻纤维一项，每年就可织布六百万匹，能满足全区用布需要。内蒙古的森林面积占全国第二位。去年一年内，从大兴安岭林区运出的木材就达二百多万立方公尺，有力地支援了各地煤矿、铁道、水利工程和城市等建设。
