    Also on "Redundant Writing"
    Mao Qi
    After reading Comrade Wu Han's article "Opposing Redundant Writing" in the People's Daily on June 15th, I feel that the issue raised is both timely and good. Moreover, the vivid examples cited are thought-provoking.
    Any work should emphasize both quantity and quality. Similarly, with writing, rambling and empty articles will never win by length because of their "grand scale." On the contrary, they will only make people feel drowsy and disgusted. As the saying goes, "Better to eat one bite of a fairy peach than half a peck of hairy chestnuts." Who wants to "chew wax" when reading an article?
    Historically, there has been no shortage of people who loved to write long articles. I think this has something to do with the emperors of the feudal era selecting officials based on their writing. Some unresigned scholars, in order to avoid the misfortune of "talent being abandoned by a wise ruler," would then cite extensively and offer ten thousand-word submissions in order to gain the emperor's favor. Some were indeed shockingly long. Dongfang Shuo of the Han Dynasty is an example. When he first arrived in Chang'an, he submitted a memorial to Emperor Wu of Han that was so voluminous it filled three thousand writing tablets, and it took the Emperor two months to read it all. Although there was some content in such a submission, it was still too long. Fortunately, there was only one Dongfang Shuo. If there were ten people like him, then I think that Emperor Wu of Han, who "slightly lacked literary talent," would have a headache and throw it aside without reading it.
    Strictly speaking, the love of writing lengthy articles is a manifestation of a lack of mass perspective. When these people pick up a pen, they indulge in literary flourishes and pedantic phrasing, only caring about their own writing pleasure, but rarely considering the interests of the readers. Lengthy and empty articles leave readers with nothing and waste a lot of time. Leaving aside everything else, just the pointless waste of other people's time alone, to use Mr. Lu Xun's words, is "no different from killing for money." Chairman Mao's criticism of these "empty and meaningless" articles was even more severe. He pointed out that those who write such articles "often write thousands of words but stray a thousand miles from the topic," seeming like talented scholars but actually harming people everywhere," and that this is a manifestation of "irresponsibility." Today, as we rectify our writing style and oppose "redundant writing," it is very beneficial to recall Chairman Mao's teachings to us.
    Naturally, short articles are more difficult to write than long articles, because to be concise and refined requires a high degree of summarization, and a high degree of summarization is inseparable from thorough and methodical thinking. Moreover, after writing, one must repeatedly revise. This requires effort and thought. However, it is worth doing, and only in this way can we eliminate "redundant writing" and write concise and vivid short articles. In order to avoid the suspicion of "overcorrection," I must finally state that we still welcome long articles that are "organized and substantive," as we have in the past. What we oppose is "redundant writing" and "bureaucratism in paperwork"!

### 也谈“繁文”

    也谈“繁文”
    毛锜
    读了6月15日人民日报上吴晗同志的“反对繁文”一文，觉得这个问题提的既及时又好。而且引了几个生动的例子，发人深省。
    任何工作，都应该是数量与质量并重，写文章同样，废话连篇，言之无物的文章，绝不会由于它的
  “洋洋大观”而以长取胜，相反，它只能使人昏昏欲睡和望文生厌。俗话说：“宁吃仙桃一口，不吃毛栗半斗”，读文章时谁愿意“嚼蜡”呢？
    历史上不乏爱写长文章的人，我想这多少和封建时代的皇帝以文取士有关，一些不甘寂寞的文人，为了避免“不才明主弃”的厄运，于是便旁征博引，万言陈辞，以求得皇帝的垂青。有些，的确长得惊人。汉朝的东方朔就是个例子。他初到长安，向汉武帝上书，多到三千奏牍，武帝看了两个月才看完。这样上书，虽有些内容，但也毕竟太长了，幸亏只有一个东方朔，如果有十个人都像他那样，那么，我想那个“略输文采”的汉武帝也会头痛得甩开不看的。
    严格地说，爱写冗长文章，是一种缺乏群众观点的表现。这种人提起笔来，舞文弄墨，咬文嚼字，只图自己写的痛快，却很少考虑到读者的利益。文章冗长空洞，使读者一无所获，而且耗去了大量的时间。不说别的，单就无端的浪费别人时间这一点论，要是用鲁迅先生的话说，那就是“无异于谋财害命”，毛主席对这种“空话连篇，言之无物”的文章，批评得更为严厉，他指出写这种文章的人“往往是‘下笔千言，离题万里’，仿佛像个才子，实则到处害人”，是一种“不负责任”的表现。在今天，我们整顿文风、反对“繁文”的同时，回忆回忆毛主席给我们的教诲，是大有好处的。
    自然，短文章较起长文章来，还是难写些，因为要短小精练，首先就得有高度的概括能力，而高度的概括，又与思想的周密和条理分不开，而且在写完之后还得反复修改。这就得花一番工夫、费一番思索。不过，这样作是值得的，也只有这样，我们才能消灭“繁文”，写出精练生动的短文章来，为了避免“矫枉过正”之嫌，最后，还必须声明一下：“有物有序”的长文章，我们像过去一样，还是欢迎的。我们反对的是“繁文”和“文牍主义”！
