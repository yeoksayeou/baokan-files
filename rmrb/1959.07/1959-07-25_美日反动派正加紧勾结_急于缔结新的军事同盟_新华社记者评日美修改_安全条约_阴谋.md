Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: A commentary by a Xinhua News Agency reporter: Under the resolute struggle of the Japanese people, the period for the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to sign a new "Security Treaty" has been forced to be postponed, but their ambitions have not died, and they are still continuing their activities. Facts show that the United States is eager to conclude a new military alliance treaty with Japan by revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," tying Japan more tightly to the American chariot to serve as its gendarme in the aggression against Asia.

According to information revealed from various sources, the revised U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will accept the provisions of the notorious U.S. "Vandenberg Resolution." Compared with the current U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," this will greatly accelerate the speed of Japanese militarization and affirm Japan's obligation to follow the United States' policy of expanding arms and preparing for war.

The "Vandenberg Resolution" is the legal basis for U.S. imperialism to urge its "allies" to step up arms expansion and war preparation and engage in military blocs. The aggressive North Atlantic Treaty and the U.S.-Chiang, U.S.-Syngman Rhee treaties are all based on this resolution. According to the "Tokyo Shimbun," Article 3 of the new draft U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" stipulates very clearly in accordance with the "Vandenberg Resolution" that the U.S. and Japan "individually or jointly, through continuous and effective self-help and mutual assistance, maintain and develop the ability to defend against armed attacks." Compared with the current "Security Treaty," which stipulates that "(the United States) hopes that Japan itself will gradually take more responsibility for its own defense against direct and indirect aggression," there has been a great development, that is: the United States can no longer be satisfied with Japan's "gradual" expansion of armaments, but needs to accelerate "development"; Japan should not only expand its armaments and prepare for war "individually," but also "jointly" with the United States.

The current U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" stipulates that Japan's "defense" is the responsibility of the U.S. military, while Article 6 of the new treaty blatantly stipulates that the U.S. and Japan should jointly fight, which is another new rope by which the United States ties Japan to its chariot.

The new article states: "The United States and Japan recognize that an armed attack against the territory of either party within the area to which this Treaty applies would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and that each would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional provisions and processes." Nobusuke Kishi himself said it more clearly. He said: "If a U.S. military base is attacked, I believe that whether it is justified or unjustified, it is naturally an attack on Japanese territory, Japanese airspace, and other inherent rights that Japan possesses." In this way, Nobusuke Kishi assured the United States that he was willing to serve as a lackey for U.S. aggression, and at the same time, he would plant the seeds of self-destruction for Japan. The focus of the U.S. reactionaries' arms expansion and war preparation is to turn Japan into a nuclear war base. Therefore, the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will not stipulate a ban on Japan's nuclear armament. On the contrary, the U.S. and Japan will stipulate in the exchange of notes the issue of the United States transporting nuclear weapons into Japan, and the two sides will conduct "consultations," which opens the door for the United States to transport nuclear weapons into Japan.

In fact, since the Kishi Nobusuke group proposed revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," it has been plotting to rely on U.S. support to carry out nuclear armament. As early as the beginning of 1958, when the Japanese "Defense Agency" was compiling the second expansion plan starting from 1960, it was based on the principle of "re-adjusting the U.S.-Japan joint defense system—changing the security treaty into a bilateral treaty," and emphasized the need to establish a "new weapon system."

The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' revision of the "Security Treaty" also harbors the ambition to establish a Northeast Asian military alliance. The United States intends to use Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands as the common applicable areas for its bilateral military treaties with Japan, the Syngman Rhee group, and the Chiang Kai-shek group, thereby connecting them together to form a new military aggression group in Northeast Asia. Nobusuke Kishi is eager to take the opportunity to become the "leader" of this military group under U.S. manipulation.

It can be seen that the United States wants to further control and utilize Japanese militarism militarily by revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The Japanese monopoly capital group is also trying to rely on U.S. support to realize its potential imperialist ambitions. This will pose a greater threat to Japan's security and peace in the Far East. The Japanese people, with the support of the people of the world, are victoriously launching unified actions one after another, and are more and more resolutely cracking down on the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to conclude a new military alliance.

### 美日反动派正加紧勾结  急于缔结新的军事同盟  新华社记者评日美修改“安全条约”阴谋

    美日反动派正加紧勾结
    急于缔结新的军事同盟
    新华社记者评日美修改“安全条约”阴谋
    新华社23日讯　本社记者述评：在日本人民的坚决斗争下，美日反动派签订新的“安全条约”的时期已经被迫推迟，但是，它们野心未死，还在继续活动。事实说明，美国急于通过修改日美“安全条约”来同日本缔结新的军事同盟条约，更紧地把日本绑在美国的战车上，充当它侵略亚洲的宪兵。
    根据各方面透露出来的消息，修改后的日美“安全条约”将接受臭名远扬的美国“范登堡决议”的规定。这和现行的日美“安全条约”来比，将大大促进日本军国主义化的速度和肯定日本追随美国扩军备战政策的义务。
    “范登堡决议”是美帝国主义促使其“盟友”加紧扩军备战、搞军事集团的法律根据。侵略性的北大西洋公约和美蒋、美李条约都是以这项决议为基础的。据“东京新闻”透露，新的日美“安全条约”草案第三条非常明确地按照“范登堡决议”规定：日美两国“单独或者联合起来，通过不断而有效的自助和互助，保持并且发展防御武装进攻的能力”。比现行“安全条约”所规定的“（美国）希望日本自己将能逐渐多负起其自身防御直接和间接侵略之责任”，有了很大的发展，即：美国不能再满足于日本“逐渐”扩充军备，而是需要加快“发展”；日本不仅要“单独”扩军备战，并且要和美国“联合”起来进行。
    现行的日美“安全条约”规定日本的“防务”由美军负责，而新的条约第六条明目张胆地规定日美要共同作战，这是美国把日本绑在它的战车上的另一条新绳索。
    新条文写道：“日美两国认为在本条约适用地区内，对缔约国的任何一方的领土实行的武装进攻实际上已经危及本国的和平与安全的时候，要按照本国宪法的规定和程序，采取行动以应付共同的危险”。岸信介自己说的更加明显。他说：“如果对美军基地进攻，我认为不管有理或者无理，自然就是对日本领土、日本领空以及其他日本拥有的当然的权利的进攻”。岸信介就这样向美国保证了他甘心充当美国侵略的鹰犬，同时也将由此为日本种下引火烧身的祸根。美国反动派的扩军备战的重点是要日本变成核战争基地。因此，在新的日美“安全条约”中将不规定禁止日本核武装，相反地，日美双方将在换文中规定关于美国把核武器运入日本的问题，由双方进行“协商”，这就为美国把核武器运入日本开辟了大门。
    实际上，岸信介集团从提出修改日美“安全条约”的第一天起，就阴谋依靠美国的支持来进行核武装。还在1958年初，日本“防卫厅”在编制从1960年起开始的第二期扩军计划时，就是以“重新调整日美共同防御体系——把安全条约改为双边条约”为原则，并且强调要建立“新武器体系”。
    美日反动派修改“安全条约”还包藏着建立东北亚军事同盟的野心。美国打算以冲绳和小笠原群岛为它和日本、李承晚集团、蒋介石集团的双边军事条约的共同适用地区，从而把它们串连在一起，在东北亚形成一个新的军事侵略集团。岸信介很想乘机成为这个在美国操纵下军事集团的“盟主”。
    由此可见，美国是想通过修改日美“安全条约”从军事上进一步控制和利用日本军国主义。而日本垄断资本集团也企图依靠美国的支持来实现它的潜在的帝国主义野心。这将对日本的安全和远东的和平构成更大的威胁。日本人民在世界各国人民的声援下正在胜利地一次接一次地展开统一行动，愈来愈坚决地打击着美日反动派缔结新的军事同盟的阴谋活动。
