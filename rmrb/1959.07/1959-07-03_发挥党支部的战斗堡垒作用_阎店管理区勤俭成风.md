    Benbao Taiyuan, 2nd – The CCP Linfen County Shi Cun Commune Yan Dian Management District, under the leadership of the Party branch, has adhered to the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily for nearly four years, and a new atmosphere of diligence and thrift for everyone has emerged.
    Under the leadership of the Party branch, this management district has resolutely struggled against the bad habit of "showing off and being afraid of being petty" in recent years (including the period of agricultural cooperatives). When the advanced cooperative was established in 1956, some people suggested taking 200 yuan from the cooperative to buy some silk flags, waist drums, dance costumes, Western drums, and Western trumpets for a lively celebration. At this time, the Party branch enlightened everyone to make a detailed calculation and asked whether this money could be used to buy an ox. In the end, everyone agreed to spend only a dozen yuan to buy more than a zhang of red cloth and firecrackers, and beat the old gongs and drums as usual to spend that day of national jubilation. In the four years from the establishment of the advanced cooperative to the present, the desks, stools and other furniture used in the office of this management district are still those from the time of the elementary cooperative; the only newly added utensils are a mimeograph machine and a washbasin. According to the plan, administrative expenses can account for 1% of the total income, but even in 1958, the year in which the most was spent, it accounted for less than 0.3% of the total income, saving more than 3,000 yuan throughout the year. Some people laughed at them for being too stingy, but Ding Zili, the Party branch secretary, said sternly: "What's the use of showing off? What we want is to increase production and increase the income of the members."
    In production and construction, the Yan Dian Management District Party branch has always adhered to the principle of saving and rationally using investment to expand production. Anything that cannot be achieved temporarily or that would affect the income of the members is not forced. In order to mobilize all the members to supervise the management committee in implementing this principle, the accounts for larger production and construction expenditures are explained to the members in advance and their opinions are solicited. When budgeting income, the Party branch always adheres to a realistic approach, and always leaves room for spending money, which is a reliable guarantee for not owing state loans or the income of members for a long time. Is the production and construction of the Yan Dian Management District less than that of other management districts? On the contrary, their production and construction scale is larger than that of the surrounding management districts. Since the establishment of the advanced cooperative, they have added 16 rubber-tired carts, 32 flat carts, 69 livestock, and also bought 6 power engines with a total of 83 horsepower.
    Giving full play to the bastion role of the Party organization in financial management is an important reason why the Yan Dian Management District can smoothly implement the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily. In recent years, major events related to the economic life of the members have been discussed in the Party branch general meeting first, so as to make the most thrifty expenditure plan. For example, this year during the wheat harvest, the 14th production team was short of 400 hemp ropes. If they were to buy them, it would cost four or five hundred yuan, which is equivalent to a reduction of one yuan in the income of each member of the team. The Party group leader of this team convened a meeting of Party members to study and come up with a method of using wheat straw to weave ropes instead of hemp ropes, saving this expenditure. This matter was well received by the members.
    The Party branch attaches great importance to the diligent and thrifty style of the Party members. The Party branch secretary has been transferred from the army and returned to his hometown for five years, and he is still wearing his old military uniform. The watch he brought back was also given to the pumping station for use. He never makes any special demands in his life. In the daily organizational life, the Party branch and Party group regularly check the diligent and thrifty style of the Party members. Therefore, in recent years, Party members have been able to set a model of cherishing public property, abiding by financial regulations, and there is no phenomenon of eating and spending extravagantly in their lives. The diligent and thrifty style of the Party members has set an example among the masses.
    Due to the conscientious implementation of the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, the production of the whole district has greatly developed. In 1958, the total grain output of the whole district increased by 280,000 jin compared with 1957, and the cotton output increased by 160,000 jin; this year, the newly harvested wheat increased by nearly one time per mu compared with last year. The development of production enabled the income of the members to catch up with the level of prosperous middle peasants in 1958, with an average income of 95 yuan per person. Now 95% of the members have savings in the credit cooperative. In the past, 14 households in Li Jia Zhuang, which had 18 households, were old debtors. Now, not only are there no debtors, but also 15 households have savings. The members generally said: "Running the commune diligently and thriftily is truly a treasure, thanks to the good leadership of the branch."

    发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用
    阎店管理区勤俭成风
    本报太原2日电　中共山西临汾县史村公社阎店管理区在党支部领导下，近四年来坚持勤俭办社的方针，出现了人人勤俭、个个节约的新风气。
    在党支部的领导下，这个管理区几年来
  （包括农业社时期）坚决和“讲排场、怕小气”的坏作风作斗争。1956年当高级社成立时，有人建议从社里拿出二百元，买些绸旗和腰鼓、舞衣、洋鼓、洋号，热热闹闹的庆祝一番。这时党支部就启发大家算细账，同时提出用这些钱是不是可以买一头耕牛？最后大家同意只花十几块钱，买了一丈多红布和鞭炮，敲打起旧锣鼓，照样度过了那个全民欢腾的日子。从高级社成立到现在的四年内，这个管理区办公室用的桌子、凳子等家具还都是初级社时候的；新增加的用具，只有一台油印机和一个洗脸盆。按计划行政管理费用可以占总收入的1％，可是花得最多的1958年也占不到总收入的0.3％，全年节约了三千多元。有人笑他们太小里小气，支部书记丁自立严正地说：“讲排场有什么用？我们要的是提高生产，增加社员收入。”
    在生产建设上，阎店管理区党支部一贯坚持节约和合理使用扩大生产投资的原则。凡是暂时达不到，或办了会影响社员收入的事都不勉强办。为了发动全体社员都来监督管理委员会执行这条原则，较大的生产建设开支账目，都事先向社员交待清楚，并征求意见。在预算收入的时候，党支部从来坚持实事求是的作风，而且花钱的时候总要留有余地，这就是长期不欠国家贷款，不欠社员收入的可靠保证。阎店管理区的生产建设是不是就比其他管理区少呢？事实相反，他们生产建设规模比周围几个管理区都大，从成立高级社以来，增加了十六辆胶轮车，三十二辆平车，六十九头牲口，还买了六台共八十三马力的动力机。
    充分发挥党组织在财务管理工作上的堡垒作用，是阎店管理区能顺利贯彻勤俭办社方针的重要原因。几年来，有关社员经济生活中的大事，都先经过支部大会讨论，以便作出最勤俭的支出方案。例如今年麦收中，第十四生产队缺四百根麻绳，如果要买就要花四、五百元，等于全队每人减少一元收入。这个队的党小组长就召集党员开会，研究出用麦秸织绳代替麻绳的办法，节省了这笔开支，这件事受到了社员的好评。
    党支部对党员的勤俭作风十分重视。党支部书记从部队转业回乡已经五年了，现在仍然穿着旧军装，带回来的手表也交给了抽水机站使用，他在生活上从不特殊。在日常的组织生活中，党的支部和党的小组经常检查党员的勤俭作风，所以几年来党员都能模范的爱护公共财产，遵守财务制度，生活上没有乱吃乱花的现象。党员的勤俭作风在群众中树立了榜样。
    由于认真贯彻了勤俭办社的方针，全区生产有了很大发展。1958年全区粮食比1957年增产了二十八万斤，棉花增产了十六万斤；今年刚刚收割的小麦每亩又比去年增产将近一倍。生产的发展使社员收入在1958年就赶上了富裕中农水平，每人平均收入九十五元。现在95％的社员在信用社有了存款。十八户的李家庄过去就有十四户老欠款户，现在不仅没有了欠款户，还有十五户有存款。社员们普遍说：“勤俭办社真是宝，多亏支部领导好。”
