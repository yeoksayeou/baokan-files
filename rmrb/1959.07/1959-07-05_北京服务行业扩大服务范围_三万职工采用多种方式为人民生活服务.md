Beijing Service Industry Expands Service Scope
Thirty Thousand Employees Use Various Methods to Serve People’s Lives

    (Our report) Beijing's 30,000 service industry employees are expanding their service scope and improving service quality to actively meet the needs of the people in daily life.

    Recently, over 370 catering, laundry, barber, and bathing service points have been expanded and added on Beijing's main streets, accounting for one-tenth of the city's original service points and adding more than 800 people. After the Dabeizhao Photo Studio expanded its original three photo studios into five large-scale professional photo studios, the daily number of photos taken increased from 3,000 to 13,000. Many laundry shops have established quick-wash departments and, in addition to mobilizing the family members of employees to participate in laundry, they also organized street women and employees of bathhouses and hotels to assist in laundry. Currently, more than 200 street laundry groups have been newly formed in the city. Some laundry shops have also set up ironing boards on the streets, offering while-you-wait shirt ironing, which is very popular with customers. The barber industry has adopted methods such as full staff deployment during busy times, rotating shifts during slack times, and scheduled appointments for haircuts, which has initially reduced the time customers wait for haircuts. Many hotels vacated office space to add beds to accommodate out-of-town travelers visiting Beijing.

    Service industry employees are actively adopting a variety of service methods to expand the scope of services. Many restaurants have begun to process staple foods such as noodles and dumplings for customers. In addition to mending clothes, turning collars, and lengthening or shortening clothes for customers, some laundry shops have also set up mobile service stations in factories and government agencies to collect and deliver clothes on a regular basis. Some barbers also provide door-to-door haircut services for elderly, sick residents, and children.

    The key to improving service quality in the catering service industry is to improve sanitation. At present, the barber tools of many barber shops are disinfected as much as possible. Many restaurants have strengthened food hygiene in the three links of procurement, storage, and sales. Knives and cutting boards are used separately for raw and cooked food, two sets of plates are used for raw and cooked food, and tea sets and tableware are also disinfected. Many hotels ensure that bedding, sheets, and pillowcases are changed after each guest leaves. (Wu Dehua, Zhou Dingfang) (Attached picture)

    北京服务行业扩大服务范围
    三万职工采用多种方式为人民生活服务
    本报讯　北京三万名服务行业的职工，正在扩大服务范围，提高服务质量，积极地满足人民在日常生活方面的需要。
    最近一个时期，在北京的主要街道上，已经扩充和增设了三百七十多个饮食、洗染、理发、洗澡等服务点，占全市原有服务点总数的十分之一，增加了八百多人。大北照相馆原来的三个照相室扩充成五个规模很大的专业照相室以后，每天的照相人数从三千人次增加到一万三千人次。许多洗染店设立了快洗部，除发动职工家属参加洗衣外，还组织街道妇女和浴室、旅馆业职工协助洗衣。现在，全市已经新组成二百多个街道洗衣小组。有的洗染店还在街道上安置烫板，烫衬衣立等可取，很受顾客欢迎。理发业采取忙时全部出动、闲时轮班休息、预约定时理发等方法，初步减少了顾客等候理发的时间。许多旅店腾出办公用房，增加床铺，接待外地来京的旅客。
    服务行业的职工积极采用多种多样的服务方式来扩大服务范围。许多饮食店开始为顾客加工面条、饺子等主食品。洗染业除了代客修补衣服、翻领换领、放长改短以外，有的洗染店还在工厂、机关设立流动服务站，定期上门收送衣服。有的理发师也上门为年老、有病的居民和孩子们理发。
    饮食服务行业提高服务质量的关键，是改进卫生工作。目前，许多理发店的理发工具都尽可能地进行了消毒。许多饮食店在采购、保管、出售三个环节上加强了食品卫生工作，刀案生熟分开使用，生熟食品分用两套盘碟，茶具、餐具也都注意消毒。许多旅店的被褥、床单、枕套等，做到客人随走随换。　　（巫德华、周定舫）（附图片）
