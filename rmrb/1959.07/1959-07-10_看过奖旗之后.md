    After Seeing the Award Banners
    Cheng Li
    For the past few months, due to work, I have been to some places and some work units: communes, production teams, government organizations, schools, factories, stores, hotels.... Wherever I went, I felt a sense of ease, vitality, and sky-high enthusiasm.
    What touched me even more was the sight of the colorful award banners hanging in prominent places like meeting rooms, clubs, and offices. They were red, yellow, green, and purple; made of cloth, silk, satin, and velvet; some were inches wide, some were feet wide, and some were more than ten feet long. The congratulatory messages were bold and sincere. After seeing them, one couldn't help but feel excited, moved, and full of admiration. Indeed, these units have done outstanding work, produced advanced individuals, achieved many excellent results, and created many miracles, making great contributions to the cause of socialist construction. How could one not admire them! How could visitors not be educated and encouraged, and also be inspired to work harder and strive for the top!
    However, every time after seeing those walls filled with award banners, I often have another thought: there are so many award banners! A dozen or dozens in one unit. Then, how many award banners would there be in the whole county, the whole province, the whole country?
    Whenever this thought appears in my mind, I have to think further: in our country, thanks to the Party's care and education and the brilliant light of the General Line, thanks to the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, the enthusiasm and creativity of the people have been continuously improved, and the talents and wisdom deeply hidden in the masses have been fully brought into play, it is inevitable that the work will be done better and better, the miracles will be created more and more, and advanced individuals and units will emerge more and more every day. These individuals and units with creativity and contribution are banners and role models, worthy of people's respect and learning. They should be rewarded and given honor, which everyone agrees with. However, can we use other methods to replace award banners? For example, certificates of merit, newspaper reports, circulars, greeting cards... and so on. Otherwise, with more and more creations, more and more award banners, year after year, decade after decade, century after century, how many award banners will be issued throughout the county, the province, and the country? How much cloth, silk, satin, and velvet will be needed? Haven't some units already had too many award banners, with no place to hang them, and had to put them in boxes or pile them up, covered in dust?
    It is said that some county Party committees in Heilongjiang Province have decided to reward advanced units and individuals with certificates of merit, circulars, and other forms in the future, and generally not issue award banners. I think this method is good, very good, and should be promoted.
    Of course, I am not advocating that award banners should not be used at all, but that they should not be used excessively. Too many award banners are not only uneconomical, but may also reduce their meaning and seriousness.

### 看过奖旗之后

    看过奖旗之后
    承里
    几个月来，因工作之便，去过一些地方，到过一些单位：有公社、生产队、机关团体、学校、工厂、商店、旅馆……。不管到那些地方或单位，都给人一种心情舒畅，活力充沛，干劲冲天的感觉。
    使人感触更深的还是，在那些会议室、俱乐部、办公室，等等引人注目的地方，挂满了彩色缤纷的奖旗。有红的、黄的、绿的、紫的；有布的、绸的、缎的、绒的；有几市寸的、数市尺的、也有足丈的。祝辞贺语，豪迈恳切。看过之后，叫人兴奋、激动，敬佩之情，油然而生。的确，这些单位工作出色，人物先进，做出许多优异的成绩，创造许多奇迹，对社会主义建设事业，贡献很大。怎能不使人敬佩呢！怎能不使参观者受到教育和鼓舞，也振起精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游呢！
    不过，每次看过那些琳琅满墙的奖旗之后，也常常产生另一种感想：奖旗真多呀！一个单位十多面、几十面。那么，全县、全省、全国，会有多少面奖旗呢？
    这种感想一出现在脑子里，都要接着想下去：在我们的国家里，由于党的关怀教育和总路线的光辉照耀，由于社会主义制度的无比优越，保证了人们的积极性和创造性的不断提高，保证了蕴藏在人民群众深处的才能和智慧的充分发挥，工作会越做越出色，奇迹会越创造越多，先进人物和单位会一天比一天多的涌现出来，这是必然的事情。这些有创造有贡献的人物和单位，是旗帜和榜样，值得人们尊敬和学习。应当给予奖励和荣誉，这也是大家双手赞成的事情。不过，能不能用另一些办法，代替奖旗呢？比如奖状、登报、通报、贺片……等等。不然的话，创造越来越多，奖旗越发越多，一年、两年、十年、百年，继续下去，全县、全省、全国，将要发出多少奖旗呢？需要多少布、绸、缎、绒呢？有的单位，不是已经因为奖旗太多，没处挂，不得不放进箱子，或堆在一起，落满灰尘了吗？
    据说，黑龙江省有的县委决定，以后用奖状、通报等形式奖励先进单位和人物，一般不发奖旗。我看，这办法好，好得很，应当推广。
    当然，我并不主张一律不用奖旗，而主张不宜过多。奖旗太多，不仅不经济，有时也会降低其意义和严肃性。
