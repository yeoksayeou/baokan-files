Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Last night, on the 7th, Beijing time, a rare phenomenon of "planetary occultation of a star" occurred in the sky. Venus, in the solar system, moved between the Earth and Regulus, a first-magnitude star in the constellation Leo, obscuring Regulus like a solar eclipse. This is an extremely rare event. It is said that since humans invented and began using telescopes to observe celestial bodies more than 300 years ago, they have never encountered Venus obscuring Regulus. Moreover, it is estimated that it will not happen again for a very long period in the future.

Scientists from various countries observed this Venus occultation of Regulus based on precisely calculated materials prepared in advance. They also filmed it. The phenomenon lasted for a total of more than eight minutes. Starting from 22:22:40 Beijing time, the crescent-shaped Venus began to obscure Regulus, and at 22:31, Regulus reappeared from behind Venus, shining brightly again.

According to scientists' observations with telescopes, the brightness of Regulus dimmed significantly in the moment before it was obscured by Venus. This fact indicates the existence of an atmosphere around Venus.

There are two scientific values in studying this rare phenomenon: first, through this phenomenon, the temperature and density of the atmosphere around Venus can be studied, which is very useful in formulating future plans to use space rockets to directly explore the atmosphere of Venus; second, the orbit of Venus can be determined more precisely.

### 千载难逢的事  金星遮住轩辕十四

    千载难逢的事
    金星遮住轩辕十四
    新华社9日讯　北京时间7日夜里，天空里发生了一个罕见的“行星掩恒星”现象，太阳系中的金星运行到地球和狮子星座中的一个一等星“轩辕十四”的中间，像“日蚀”一样，把“轩辕十四”遮住了。这是千载难逢的事。据说，自从人类在三百多年前发明和开始使用望远镜观测天体以来，还没有碰到过金星掩
  “轩辕十四”。而且据估计，今后在很长的一段时期内不会碰到。
    各国科学家根据事前早就精确地推算出来的材料观测了这次金星掩“轩辕十四”。并且拍摄了电影。这种现象一共持续了八分多钟。从北京时间二十二时二十二分四十秒，呈上弦月形的金星就开始遮住“轩辕十四”，到二十二时三十一分，“轩辕十四”又重新从金星后面显露出来，重放光明。
    据科学家用望远镜观测，当“轩辕十四”还没有被金星遮住前的一个瞬间，“轩辕十四”的光亮度显著地变暗。这一事实说明了金星周围有大气存在。
    研究这次罕见现象的科学价值有二：一，通过这个现象可以研究金星周围大气的温度和密度，这在订定将来用宇宙火箭前往直接探测金星大气的计划时，非常有用；二，可以更精密地确定金星的运行轨道。（附图片）
