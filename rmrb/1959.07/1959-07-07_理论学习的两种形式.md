    Two Forms of Theoretical Study

    For leading cadres at all levels of the Party, the form of short-term, off-the-job, concentrated study is an effective way to organize leading cadres to conduct theoretical study. It proceeds from the actual situation, concentrating on studying the important resolutions of the Party Central Committee, the important instructions of Chairman Mao, and related theoretical works, and unifying the application of theory with the implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines, thereby achieving a double harvest of thought and work. All units with the conditions should consider adopting this form to rapidly improve the theoretical and policy thinking level of leading cadres at all levels, thereby continuously promoting the progress of work.

    In addition, learning and writing groups, taking organs, schools, or enterprises as units, with the Party committee as the core, and the secretary as the leader, absorbing some responsible cadres with a certain level, are a good form of organizing leading cadres to study theory and summarize work experience. It proceeds from reality, and combines work, study, scientific research, lecturing, and writing very well. It not only powerfully promotes the current central work, but also plays an extremely important role in the development of the entire propaganda and education work. This form of learning should also be vigorously promoted and universally popularized.

    At present, the broad masses of cadres, especially the leading cadres at all levels of the Party, have a great enthusiasm for theoretical study, and have also gained some good experiences in the past. We believe that as long as Party organizations at all levels further strengthen leadership, and promptly summarize and promote good experiences in theoretical study, the theoretical study of the broad masses of cadres, especially the leading cadres at all levels of the Party, will surely achieve a greater leap forward on the basis of the past.

    理论学习的两种形式
    对于党的各级领导干部来说，短期离职脱产集中学习的形式，是组织领导干部进行理论学习行之有效的好办法。它从实际情况出发，集中地学习党中央的重大决议、毛主席的重要指示，和有关的理论著作和运用理论与贯彻党的方针政策统一了起来，因而也就达到了思想、工作双丰收的目的。凡是有条件的单位，都应该考虑采用这种形式，以便迅速提高各级领导干部的理论和政策思想水平，从而不断地推动工作前进。
    此外，以机关、学校或企业为单位，以党委为核心，以书记为组长，吸收一部分有一定水平的负责干部参加的学习和写作小组，是组织领导干部学习理论、总结工作经验的一种好形式。它从实际出发，把工作、学习、科学研究、讲课和写作很好地结合了起来。它不仅有力地推动了当前的中心工作，而且对于整个宣传教育工作的开展，也有着极为重要的作用。这种学习形式，也应该大力提倡和普遍地推广。
    目前，广大干部特别是党的各级领导干部对理论学习的劲头很大，过去也取得了一些比较好的经验，我们相信，各级党组织，只要进一步加强领导，并及时总结和推广理论学习的好经验，广大干部特别是党的各级领导干部的理论学习，就一定能在过去的基础上，获得更大的跃进。
