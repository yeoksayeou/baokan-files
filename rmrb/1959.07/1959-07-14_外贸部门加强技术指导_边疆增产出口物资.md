    This newspaper reports that foreign trade departments in Yunnan Province are strengthening technical guidance on foreign trade materials in border minority areas. In the first half of this year, the output value of export materials increased by 6.3% compared to the same period last year.

    Since the beginning of this year, the Yunnan Provincial Bureau of Foreign Trade has transferred nearly 150 cadres to grassroots units in border minority areas to provide long-term technical guidance. They have successively run training classes for technicians in mining crystal, mica, and manufacturing aromatic oils in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture and the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture. In the Nujiang Autonomous Prefecture alone, more than 300 Lisu workers have been trained in mining mica ore. The Yunnan Provincial Foreign Trade Department has also assisted ethnic minorities in border areas to solve the problem of lacking equipment. At present, 150 sets of distillers for manufacturing aromatic oils and some mineral processing equipment for mica and crystal have been shipped to various border areas.

    Now, the production of foreign trade materials in border areas has greatly developed. The Tibetan people in Deqin County have produced more than 400 tons of asbestos, and the Dai farmers in Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture have used wild plants to produce more than 20 kinds of aromatic oils. In order to transport these products out as soon as possible, all localities have strengthened transportation work. Tibetan farmers in Deqin County have organized a professional transportation team to use yaks and horses to transport high-quality asbestos to the roadside. The Nujiang Autonomous Prefecture has used empty trucks to transport a lot of mica.

    The border minority areas of Yunnan are rich in resources, and many local specialties are loved by foreigners. Such as the "Sanqi" of Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the Poria cocos of Lijiang Tibetan area, the silk woven bags and hemp threads of Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, as well as precious medicinal materials such as musk, and the citronella of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, are all export materials with good sales. The golden monkey, rare in the world, is also produced in the mountains and ridges of these areas. After the people of all ethnic groups improve their production technology of collection and processing, these rich materials will be better utilized.

    外贸部门加强技术指导
    边疆增产出口物资
    本报讯　云南省外贸部门在边疆少数民族地区加强外贸物资的技术指导工作，今年上半年出口物资的产值比去年同期增加了6.3％。
    今年以来，云南省对外贸易局已经抽调了近一百五十名干部到边疆少数民族地区的基层单位长期进行技术指导。他们先后在怒江傈僳族自治州、西双版纳傣族自治州开办了开采水晶石、云母和制造芳香油的技术人员训练班。仅怒江自治州就培养出开采云母矿石的傈僳族工人三百多名。云南省外贸部门还协助边疆少数民族解决缺乏设备的困难。现在，一百五十套制造芳香油的蒸馏器和一些云母、水晶石的选矿设备，已先后运往边疆各地。
    现在，边疆外贸物资的生产已有很大发展。德钦县的藏族人民已经生产出四百多吨石棉，西双版纳自治州的傣族农民已经利用野生植物生产出芳香油二十多种。各地为了尽快地把这些产品调运出去，都加强了运输工作。德钦县藏族农民组织了一支专业运输队伍，用牦牛和马把质量很高的石棉运送到公路边。怒江自治州已经利用放空汽车运输了不少云母。
    云南边疆少数民族地区的资源很丰富，许多土特产品为国外人士所喜爱。如文山僮族苗族自治州的“三七”，丽江藏族地区的伏苓，德宏傣族景颇族自治州的丝织挂包、麻线以及麝香等名贵药材，西双版纳傣族自治州的香茅草等，都是销路很好的出口物资。世界上罕见的金丝猴，也出产在这些地区的丛山峻岭中。各族人民提高采集和加工的生产技术以后，这些丰富的物资将被更好地利用起来。
