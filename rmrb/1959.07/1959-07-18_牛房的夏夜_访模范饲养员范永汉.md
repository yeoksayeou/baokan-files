    Summer Nights in the Cowshed
    ——Visiting Model Stockman Fan Yonghan
      By Our Correspondent Qu Yifan
    Dusk. The blazing sun disappears into the dense forest enveloping Fanjia Village, and bursts of evening breeze sweep through the doors and windows of the cowshed, dispelling the daytime heat.

  Finding Feed by All Means Possible
    Fan Yonghan, the leader of the livestock raising team of the Yuejin Production Team of the Zhulinqiao Commune in Guanghua County, Hubei Province, pulls a heavily laden cart, sweating profusely, as he enters the cowshed gate. The four stockmen who are washing stone troughs and rinsing green grass in the cowshed immediately rush forward to help him unload the bags of grain from the cart. We also go up to shake hands with Old Fan and ask:
    "Is this feed grain brought from the brigade?" Old Fan shakes his head and wipes the sweat from his face, saying:
      "This is processed grain brought from the grain department in Zhulinqiao Street. Processing a hundred catties of grain can earn more than ten catties of bran feed."
    They have specially installed a large stone mill in the cowshed to grind the feed grain (dried beans) they receive into bean dregs, which not only produces more feed, but also is loved by the cattle and helps them gain weight. The powder from the bean dregs is further processed into vermicelli, which is sold to the town's non-staple food department, which can then be exchanged for more feed. As the busy farming season arrives, they always try every possible means to ensure that the livestock eat more concentrated feed. "Of course," Old Fan said, "to feed livestock so they are strong and fat, simply relying on concentrated feed is not enough; it is even more important to think of ways to get more roughage." For example, during the busy farming season when there is no time for grazing, Old Fan specially organizes a group of children to collect green fodder; Old Fan himself often takes time out from his busy schedule to collect green fodder, so that the livestock can eat tender and fresh green fodder when they return from work, and he often adjusts their diet.

      Handover
    Night falls. Two kerosene lamps are hung on the beams of the large seven-room cowshed, illuminating the entire room brightly. At this time, thirty-two head of cattle, eleven horses, and two donkeys successively return to their stalls from the threshing ground, the cultivated fields, the carts, and the collective canteen's mill. Fan Yonghan and all the members of the team are at the gate of the cowshed, welcoming them like old friends. They first tether the horses and donkeys to the troughs to feed; then they tether the oxen in the square outside the house, allowing the cattle that have labored all day to rest before bringing them back to the troughs to feed in the middle of the night. Each time a batch of livestock returns, the male or female foreman in charge of using the cattle, must verbally report the working condition of each animal on that day to Old Fan. This allows the stockmen to discover as early as possible whether they have found signs of illness or overexertion during the work period. With this information in mind, they can take extra care of them during the night, and prevent and treat illnesses early. Similarly, when the livestock go out to work every morning, the stockmen also proactively report the condition of the livestock during the night to the foremen who come to lead the cattle and horses, so that they can use the livestock appropriately and take more care of them.

      Midnight Patrol
    The night is deep, and people are fast asleep. In the dim moonlight, I followed Fan Yonghan, pacing back and forth among the cattle. He looked at whether this cow was chewing its cud (a healthy sign when cattle are resting), and also observed the complexion of that cow. When he walked up to "Big Suzi" cow (each cow has its own name), he suddenly smelled a foul odor, which caught Old Fan's attention. He carefully examined it for a while, frowned, and turned to me and said, "Whenever a cow has bad breath, it is often a sign of illness." He immediately went back to the cowshed to get some salt water to rinse the cow's mouth and brush its teeth, and also pulled out the cow's tongue to wash it clean. According to Old Fan's many years of experience, in such cases, immediately helping it clean its mouth and teeth can prevent disease and eliminate disasters. Then, he walked to the Big Black cow. The Big Black cow leaned its head tightly against its master's arms in a coquettish manner, and Old Fan patted the Big Black cow's round back affectionately...

      Friends in Adversity
    Speaking of Old Fan's relationship with the Big Black cow, many members of the Yuejin team say they are "friends in adversity." It was in the winter of 1957. The Big Black cow, which was already twenty-one years old, had old and loose teeth, and its strength had declined. In addition, it had not been well fed in the hands of individual farmers in the past and had lost weight. At that time, it was also cold and freezing, and the Big Black cow's movements seemed even more difficult. One day, Fan Yonghan went out to do some errands, and several cadres of the agricultural cooperative sent someone to take the Big Black cow to Zhulinqiao Street to sell it. When Old Fan came back and didn't see the Big Black cow, he asked around and found out that it had been taken to be sold, so he turned around and ran to the street. When he asked on the street, he found out that it had already been taken to the slaughterhouse; he rushed straight to the slaughterhouse. At this time, the old cow was already tied up, just waiting to be slaughtered. After Old Fan's repeated requests, the cow was redeemed from the butcher's knife. From then on, Old Fan took extra care of the Big Black cow. It couldn't chew hard grass, so Old Fan chopped and mashed the grass and feed, feeding it bite by bite as if feeding a baby; sometimes he would even secretly take the bean noodles ground at his own home to feed the cow. The Big Black cow's physique became stronger day by day. Now, it has become a strong cow with relatively strong physical strength in the Yuejin Brigade, not only able to pull a double-shared plow for deep plowing, but also able to pull a long cart.

  Vacating His Own House
    Old Fan returned from the square to the stable and added green fodder to the horse trough, mixed it with water, mixed it with wheat bran, and poured another layer of feed beans, and the horse ate even more happily. This fifty-year-old stockman talked to me about the origin of why he fell in love with the stockman profession while taking care of the horses: Old Fan was born into a poor peasant family, and more than twenty years ago, his family had neither a tile to cover their heads nor an inch of land under their feet. He worked as a hired hand for the landlord and suffered all kinds of humiliation; later, he rented ten mu of land from the landlord, and the rent was high and the taxes were heavy. He worked hard all year round but still lacked food and clothing, relying on borrowing usurious loans to survive. At that time, he could not afford to raise cattle, so he had to exchange labor with the landlord for cattle work, working for the landlord for two or three days before he could exchange for one day of cattle work. However, the cunning landlord insisted on having him and the cattle work on his land first during the busy season. When it was Old Fan's turn to lead the cattle to cultivate his own land, the season had passed, the land had dried up, and the crops never grew well. After liberation, during the land reform, Old Fan was allocated eleven mu of land, two rooms, and a cow, and he no longer suffered from the landlord's anger. In the winter of 1953, when the agricultural cooperative was established, Old Fan actively signed up to participate and personally took the cow to the cooperative as a share. At that time, although only six cows and a donkey were concentrated, the difficulties encountered were very great: Who would feed the cattle? Where to find a cowshed? The cooperative was newly established, and the family property was thin, and people's hearts were not united. Many people were unwilling to feed the cattle, because they felt it was dirty and troublesome; the cadres in the society held several meetings to solve the problem of the cowshed, but there was no way. Thus, after discussions among the cadres, Fan Yonghan was asked to be the stockman, and the six cows were temporarily tethered in the open air in front of and behind the village. One evening, the weather suddenly changed, the north wind roared, and goose feather snow fell in an instant. This really stumped this newly appointed stockman. Seeing the cattle shivering from the cold, he couldn't figure out how to solve it. Finally, Old Fan made up his mind to go home to mobilize his lover to vacate the two rooms newly divided during the land reform to be used as a cowshed to protect the cattle and get through the winter safely.

      "Where will the whole family live?" Old Fan's lover asked with difficulty. Old Fan used gentle and persuasive words to get through to his lover, explaining the reasons why poor people suffered without cattle in the past, and finally moved his family to live in a thatched shed in the front yard. The bedding and furniture immediately crowded the small shed. In the evening, Old Fan led the cooperative's cattle into the two warm main rooms to live. The cooperative's cattle lived in Old Fan's house for three consecutive years, and Old Fan never complained; until 1956, when the primary cooperative was transformed into an advanced cooperative, the cooperative was expanded, there were more cattle and horses, and the family property of the cooperative was also solid after several years of operation, and the spacious new cowshed that we have today was built.
    This spring, Fan Yonghan gloriously joined the Communist Party and was elected as the Yuejin team's cattle manager, responsible for leading the team's livestock raising and management work. At the same time, he also serves as the leader of the cowshed's raising team, and the other four stockmen in the team are responsible for raising cattle, while he himself voluntarily takes on the role of horse raiser. He believes that horses are more delicate than cattle - cattle only need to be fed for more than two hours at night, while horses eat and stop all night; the stockman who raises horses needs to put in more labor and more careful and considerate care. Old Fan has always been "suffering first, enjoying later," and never cares about personal gains or losses for the sake of the collective cause. Every year, he gives all the material prizes he receives as a labor model to all the members of the raising team, except for the award certificates and medals issued to individuals. He said, "Everyone shares the burden of a thousand catties, and everyone has a share in the credit." Therefore, the stockmen all support him.

    牛房的夏夜
    ——访模范饲养员范永汉
      本报记者　曲一凡
    黄昏，炽烈的太阳隐没在笼罩范家村的密林中，阵阵晚风穿过牛房的门窗，扫除着日间留下的燥热气息。
  多方设法弄饲料
    湖北省光化县竹林桥公社跃进生产队的饲养组长范永汉，拉着一辆负载沉重的架子车，汗流浃背，跨进了牛房大门。正在牛房里涮石槽和淘洗青草的四个饲养员，立即热情地迎上前去，帮助他把一袋袋粮食卸下车。我们也迎上去同老范握手，顺便问道：
    “这是从大队里领来的饲料粮吧？”老范摇摇头，用手抹去脸上的汗珠说：
      “这是从竹林桥街上粮食部门拉来的加工粮。加工一百斤粮，可以赚十几斤麸子饲料。”
    他们在牛房里专门安装了一盘大水磨，把领来的饲料粮（干豆）磨成豆渣，既能多出饲料，牛也爱吃，吃了容易长膘。豆渣中的粉沫，他们又进一步加工制成粉丝，卖给镇上的副食品部门，这样又能换回更多的饲料。农忙的季节到了，他们总是千方百计使牲口吃到更多的精饲料。“当然”，老范说：“要想把牲畜喂得肥壮，单纯依靠精饲料也不中，更要从粗饲料方面多想些门路。”譬如大农忙中没有时间放牧，老范专门组织了一帮儿童打青饲料；老范自己也常在百忙中，抽出休息时间打青，让牲畜卸套回来能够吃上柔嫩鲜味的青饲料，并且经常给它们调剂口味。
      交　接　班
    夜幕降临了。一幢七间的宽大牛房，在屋梁上挂起了两盏马灯，照耀得满屋通光明亮。这时，三十二头牛、十一匹马和两头驴子，先后从打麦场上、耕种的田间，大车上、集体食堂的磨坊里，陆续地卸套归栏了。范永汉和全组饲养员们都在牛房大门口，好像欢迎老朋友似地迎接着，他们先把马和驴子拴上槽喂；然后把耕牛都拴在屋外的广场上，让劳累了一天的耕牛歇息儿，到半夜时再牵回槽喂。每回来一批牲畜，专管用牛的男掌鞭或女磨倌，都要向老范口头交代一下当天每头牲畜的工作情况，这样便于饲养员们及早发现它们在出工期间是否发现害病、过累等征候，心中有了数，好在夜间饲养中格外加以照顾，有病就早防早治。同样，当牲畜每天早上出工时，饲养员也把牲畜在夜间的表现状况，主动地向前来牵牛马的掌鞭、磨倌们交代一番，也便于他（她）们用牲畜时量情使用，多加爱护。
      深夜的巡回
    夜深了，人们都睡熟了。在朦胧的月光下，我跟着范永汉，在牛群中穿来踱去。他看看这头牛是不是在倒沫（牛歇息时嘴内倒沫是一种健康象征），又望望那头牛的气色如何。当他走到“大嗉子”牛（每头牛都有自己的名字）跟前，忽然闻到一股臭味，引起老范的注意。他仔细端详一会，皱了皱眉头，回头对我说：“凡是牛嘴里有臭气，往往是生病的预兆。”他马上回牛房拿些盐水来给牛漱口擦牙，把牛舌头也掏出来洗净。根据老范多年的经验，遇到这种情况，马上帮它把口腔、牙齿洗净，可起防病消灾的作用。然后，他又走到大黑牛面前，大黑牛撒娇似地把脑袋紧贴在主人的怀里，老范爱抚地轻拍着大黑牛浑圆的脊背……
      患难之交
    提起老范同大黑牛的关系，跃进队许多社员都说他（它）们是“患难之交”。那是1957年冬天，年龄已满二十一个年头的大黑牛，口老牙脱，气力衰退，加上过去在单干户手里饲养得不好，跌了膘。而当时又是天寒地冻，大黑牛的行动更显得艰难了。有一天，范永汉外出办事，农业社几个干部派人把大黑牛牵上竹林桥街卖了。老范回来，不见大黑牛，打听后知道是牵去卖了，扭头就往街上跑。到街上一问，已被牵往宰场去了；他直往宰场飞奔。这时，老牛已上了绑绳，只等开刀了。在老范再三要求下，才又把牛从屠刀下赎回来。从此以后，老范对大黑牛加倍照料，它嚼不动硬草，老范就把草和料切烂捣碎，好像喂婴儿一样一口一口地喂食；有时还背着爱人，把自家磨的豆面拿来喂牛。大黑牛的体质，一天比一天肥壮了。如今，它又成为跃进大队的体力较强的壮牛，不仅能拽着双铧犁深耕，还能够拉长趟大车。
  腾出自己的屋来
    老范从广场回到马厩间，又给马槽里添上了青饲料，掺了水，拌上麦麸子，又倒上一层料豆，马吃得更欢了。这个五十多岁的老饲养员，一边照料着马匹，一边同我谈起了他为什么爱上了饲养员这一行的来历：老范出身贫农，二十多年前他家上无片瓦，下无寸土，给地主当雇工，受尽了屈辱；后来佃种了地主的十亩地，租高税重，终年辛苦仍是缺吃少穿，靠借高利贷混日子。那时自己喂不起牛，只好用人工和地主换牛工，先给地主干两三天，才能换一天的牛工。可是，诡计多端的地主，硬要在抢火色的关节眼儿，连人带牛先给他干完地里活。等到轮着老范牵牛来给自家耕种时，季节也过了，土地也干结了，庄稼总是长不好。解放后土地改革中，老范分到了十一亩地，两间房，一头牛，再也不受地主的窝囊气了。1953年冬成立农业合作社，老范积极报名参加，亲自把牛牵到社入股。当时，虽然只集中了六头牛和一头毛驴，可是遇到的困难却很大：谁来喂牛呢？到哪里找牛屋呢？合作社初建立，家底薄，人心也不齐，许多人都不愿喂牛，嫌脏，怕麻烦；社里干部们为解决牛屋问题，开了几次会都没办法。这样，经过干部们讨论就请范永汉当饲养员，六头牛临时拴在村前屋后的露天里。有一天傍晚，天气陡变，北风怒吼，顷刻间纷纷落起鹅毛大雪来。可真把这位刚上任的饲养员难坏了，眼看着牛冻得只打颤，咋想也没门儿。最后，老范下定决心回家动员自己的爱人，要把土改中新分的两间屋子腾出来做牛屋，保护耕牛安全过冬。
      “一家大人孩子往哪里住呢？”老范的爱人为难地问。老范就把从前穷人无牛受尽磨难的道理，婉言细语地打通了爱人的思想，终于将自己一家老少搬到前院里一间茅棚子里住，铺床和家具霎时把小棚屋挤得满满的。晚上，老范就把社里的耕牛，牵进两间暖和的正屋住下。社里的耕牛，在老范的家里一连住了三年，老范从无半句怨言；直到1956年由初级社转为高级社，社又扩大了，牛马更多了，办了几年社家底也厚实了，才盖起了如今的这座宽敞的新牛房。
    今年春天，范永汉光荣地参加了共产党，并且当选为跃进队的管牛队长，负责领导全队的牲畜饲养管理工作。同时，他还兼任着这座牛房的饲养组长，组里其他四位饲养员专管养牛，他自己却主动地担当着养马员。他认为，马比牛更娇气一些——牛在夜里只要两个多钟头就能喂饱，而马却是通宵吃吃停停；养马的饲养员需要付出更多的劳动，和更细心体贴的照料。老范这人，一向就是“吃苦在前，享乐在后”，为了集体事业，从不计较个人得失。他每年当选劳动模范得的奖品，除了把发给个人的奖状奖章留下，把物质奖品全部给全组饲养员。他说：“千斤担子众人挑，论功劳大家都有一份儿。”因此，饲养员们个个拥护他。
