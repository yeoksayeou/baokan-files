Xinhua News Agency Report: Shandong Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of early-season Chinese medicinal herbs this year. More than 524,000 catties of the famous Lunan honeysuckle have been collected. More than 28,000 catties of high-quality Shandong whole scorpions have been purchased. More than 66,700 catties of Atractylodes lancea, Platycodon grandiflorus, and Scutellaria baicalensis have also been purchased.

This year, Shandong Province has conscientiously implemented the method of "local production, local supply" and actively developed the production of Chinese medicinal materials. According to preliminary statistics, the province has introduced dozens of plant medicinal materials from other places this spring, including ginseng, Coptis chinensis, Atractylodes macrocephala, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Rehmannia glutinosa, and Curcuma aromatica, and has cultivated more than 100 kinds of wild plant medicinal materials such as Saposhnikovia divaricata, Polygonum multiflorum, and Arctium lappa, with a planting area of more than 175,000 mu. In terms of animal medicinal materials, Shandong Province has also begun to trial-raise nearly 10 kinds of wild animals such as Tu Yuan and whole scorpions this year.

In view of the wide distribution and many types of Chinese medicinal materials, Shandong Province is continuing to focus on the production and protection of medicinal materials in the second half of this year, stipulating drug collection systems, organizing collaboration between agriculture, forestry, and medicinal material departments, contracting collection and purchase, protecting mountains and forests, and actively and steadily carrying out medicinal material planting.

Reported by this newspaper: Under the conscientious implementation of the instructions of the State Council and the Provincial People's Committee on the development of Chinese medicinal materials production, Liaoning Province has achieved unprecedented development in the production of Chinese medicinal materials. As of the end of May, the province had planted 61,411 mu of medicinal materials, an increase of ten times over the planting area last year.

Liaoning's medicinal material production this year is not only large in planting area, but also has many cultivated varieties. This year, 138 varieties have been planted in various places, of which 88 varieties, including Panax notoginseng, Ophiopogon japonicus, Ligusticum chuanxiong, and Chaenomeles speciosa, have not been planted in the province in the past; more than 50 kinds of medicinal materials such as Paeonia obovata, Schisandra chinensis, Asarum heterotropoides, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Eupolyphaga sinensis, and whole scorpions have been changed from wild to domestic cultivation and breeding. More than ten kinds of household medicinal materials that require a wide range, such as safflower, fennel, Datura stramonium, and Aristolochia debilis, have been planted on a large scale in various places this year. These large-scale cultivated medicinal materials have strong seedlings and grow well.

In the past, only five or six counties in Liaoning Province planted ginseng, but this year it has been expanded to 24 cities and counties including Benxi and Xiuyan. The amount of ginseng planted is now 2,055 curtains more than at the beginning of the year.

In order to obtain experience in introducing and trial planting, 51 medicinal material test sites have been established in various places, basically achieving a test site in every county. The test sites have tried and introduced up to 500 varieties. In order to strengthen the technical guidance of medicinal material production, various places have adopted the method of relying on the masses and training at all levels to train a large number of medicinal material technical forces. At present, the province has trained 1,232 medicinal material production technicians from communes, medical institutions, schools, and supply and marketing departments, enriching the technical force for medicinal material production, collection, and processing.

While planting Chinese medicinal materials, various places in the province have also actively carried out the work of surveying wild medicinal resources and collecting wild medicinal materials. With the cooperation of Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, many municipal and county health, agriculture, forestry, and commercial departments have jointly formed wild medicinal resource survey teams to survey medicinal material resources and collect wild medicinal materials. The harvest of medicinal resource surveys is very large. Xin Jin County discovered a large area of wild Schisandra chinensis fifteen miles long near Shuangta Commune. Anshan City initially surveyed the medicinal resources of Qianshan, and found 136 kinds of medicinal materials.

Due to the close cooperation between commercial departments and production and marketing departments, the purchase of medicinal materials has also achieved remarkable results. From January to May, Liaoning Province purchased 9,285,000 catties of medicinal materials, an increase of three times over the same period last year.

    山东早期中药材空前丰收
    辽宁药材生产发展很快
    据新华社讯　山东省今年早期中药材空前丰收。著名的鲁中南金银花已采集五十二万四千多斤。品质优良的山东全蝎已收购了二万八千多斤。还收购了苍术、桔梗、黄苓等六万六千七百多斤。
    今年山东省认真贯彻执行“就地生产、就地供应”的方法，积极发展了中药材生产。据初步统计：全省在今春从外地引种的植物药材有人参、黄连、白术、川芎、生地、玉金等几十种，同时栽培了防风、何首乌、牛子等一百多种野生植物药材，种植面积达十七万五千多亩。在动物药材方面，山东省今年也开始试行家养土园、全蝎等近十种野生动物。
    山东省根据中药材分布面广，种类多的情况，今年下半年正在继续抓好药材生产保护工作，规定采药制度，组织农林、药材部门协作，包采包购，保护山林，积极稳妥地开展药材种植工作。
    本报讯　在认真贯彻执行国务院和省人委关于发展中药材生产的指示下，辽宁省的中药材生产获得了空前的发展。截至5月末，全省已种植药材六万一千四百十一亩，比去年的种植面积扩大了十倍。
    辽宁今年的药材生产，不但种植面积大，而且栽培品种多。今年各地种植的品种有一百三十八种，其中的三七、麦冬、川芎、木瓜等八十八种，是省内过去没有种植过的；赤芍、五味子、细莘、甘草、土虫、全虫等五十多种药材是变野生为家种家养的。需要较广的红花、小茴香、大力子、马兜苓等十余种家种药材，今年各地进行了大面积种植。这些大面积养植的药材，幼苗茁壮，生长良好。
    过去辽宁省仅有五、六个县种植人参，今年已扩大到本溪、岫岩等二十四个市、县。现在人参的种植量比年初增加了二千零五十五帘。
    为了取得引种试种经验，各地共建立了五十一处药材试验场，基本上达到县县有试验场。试验场试种、引种的品种最多的有五百多种。为了加强药材生产的技术指导，各地采取依靠群众、逐级培训的方法，培养了大批药材技术力量。现在全省已培训出公社、医疗院所、学校、供销部门的药材生产技术人员一千二百三十二名，充实了药材生产、采挖、加工等技术力量。
    在种植中药材的同时，省内各地还积极开展了勘察野生药源和采挖野生药材的工作。在沈阳药学院的配合下，不少市、县的卫生、农、林、商业等部门共同组成了野生药源勘察队，勘察药材资源和采集野生药材。药源勘察的收获很大。新金县在双塔公社附近发现了十五里地长的大面积野生的五味子。鞍山市初步勘察了千山的药源，即发现一百三十六种药材。
    由于商业部门与产销部门密切协作，药材的收购工作也获得了显著成绩。1至5月份，辽宁全省已收购药材九百二十八万五千斤，比去年同期增加了三倍。
