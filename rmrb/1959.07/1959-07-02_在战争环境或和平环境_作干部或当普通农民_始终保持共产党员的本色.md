Whether in War or Peace, as a Cadre or Ordinary Farmer
Always Maintain the True Qualities of a Communist Party Member
Ji Shufa, Deputy Secretary of the General Party Branch of the Tang'erli Production Team

    On June 15th, under a clear blue sky, the sun scorched the ground. In the wheat field at the entrance of Tang'erli Village, Baxian County, Hebei Province, people were busily harvesting and threshing wheat, songs and laughter filling the entire threshing ground. An old commune member wearing a worn-out military uniform was busy turning the wheat and sweeping the edges of the field, eagerly taking on all kinds of tasks. Secretary Song of the Commune Party Committee told me that this old commune member was Ji Shufa, the Deputy Secretary of the General Party Branch of the Tang'erli Production Brigade, with twenty years of Party membership.

    Ji Shufa is fifty-seven years old this year. In 1938, he joined the Eighth Route Army, rising from a soldier to a battalion commander. He participated in the famous Mount Lubo battle, the defense of Yan'an, and the battles of Wazi Street and Lanzhou in the liberation of Northwest China. From the banks of the Yalu River in the east to the foot of the Kunlun Mountains in the west, his footprints were left everywhere. He shed blood on the battlefield and lost an eye. After the national liberation, the organization wanted him to spend his remaining years in a sanatorium, but he repeatedly requested to return to his hometown to participate in agricultural production. The organization finally approved his request.

    Years of cultivation and education by the Party have enabled Ji Shufa to always maintain the true qualities of a Communist Party member, whether in war or peace, whether serving in a leadership position or as an ordinary farmer. In the spring of 1952, after returning to his hometown, which he had been away from for fourteen years, Ji Shufa enthusiastically handed over all his demobilization settlement expenses to the Party organization and deposited them in the bank. He himself lived frugally and never asked the government for a penny or a grain of food. He went to the fields early every day, carrying a manure basket. He picked up every dung beetle he saw, and he picked up every piece of firewood he found on the road. He cultivated the land allocated to him by the government evenly and neatly, and the crops grew strong and full of grain. In the first autumn, he harvested twenty-five dan of grain. After setting aside food for his own consumption, he sold most of the grain to the state. In 1953 and 1954, he sold more than 2,500 jin of surplus grain to the state. The villagers praised him for "maintaining the old traditions of the Eighth Route Army."

    Since Ji Shufa became a village cadre in 1953, he has not only lived a simple personal life but also frequently educated everyone to pay attention to thrift. Last autumn, he led nearly five hundred commune members to Xinan Town to assist in deep plowing. Because of the bumper harvest of grain in the autumn, some commune members did not pay attention to saving grain and even wanted to eat five meals a day. Ji Shufa first convened a meeting of all Party members in the team, and then convened a meeting of all cadres and the masses. At the meeting, he said to everyone, "We used to eat little and wear little. Now that we have just saved some grain, we want to eat and drink extravagantly. This is not right. We should be thrifty and make it last longer." He said, "We should save at the top of the granary, not at the bottom of the bowl." After discussion, everyone agreed that what Ji Shufa said was reasonable! From then on, everyone consciously saved food and used it sparingly. After the deep plowing was over, other brigades consumed much more grain, and the commune members had many complaints. Only the Tang'erli Brigade did not exceed the standard.

    Ji Shufa said that he is now one of the heads of a team. Since the masses want us to manage the household, we should manage this household diligently. We must always learn from the selfless, hard-working, and simple qualities of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary leaders, care for the masses, and do a good job in the cause entrusted to us by the people.

### 在战争环境或和平环境　作干部或当普通农民  始终保持共产党员的本色

    在战争环境或和平环境  作干部或当普通农民
    始终保持共产党员的本色
    堂二里生产队党总支副书记    纪树发
    6月15日，碧空万里，阳光晒得地面上发烫。在河北省霸县堂二里村头麦场上，人们正在紧张地收打小麦，歌声、笑声洋溢在整个打麦场里。有一位穿着旧军装的老社员，在忙着翻麦子，扫场边，样样的活儿他都抢着干。公社党委宋书记向我说，这位老社员就是有了二十年党龄的堂二里生产大队的党总支副书记纪树发。
    纪树发今年五十七岁了。他在1938年参加了八路军，由战士升任到营长，曾参加过著名的鲁柏山战斗、保卫延安和解放大西北的瓦子街战役、兰州战役等。东起鸭绿江边，西到昆仑山麓，都留下了他的足迹。他在战场上流过鲜血又失去了一只眼睛。全国解放后，组织上要他去休养院安度晚年，他却一再要求回乡参加农业生产，组织上最后批准了他的要求。
    党多年来的培养和教育，使纪树发不论在战争环境还是在和平环境里，不论是担任领导工作还是当一个普通的农民，他都始终保持着一个共产党员的本色。1952年春天，纪树发兴致勃勃地回到阔别了十四年的家乡以后，把全部转业安家费都交给了党组织，存到了银行里。他自己省吃俭用，从不伸手向政府要一文钱、一颗粮食。他每天一早下地，来去背着粪筐，见一个粪蛋就拾起来，路上碰到一根柴草也要捡回家里。他把政府拨给他的地种得平平整整，庄稼长得苗壮粒满，第一年秋天就收了二十五担粮食。他除留下口粮以外，把大部分粮食卖给了国家。在1953年和1954年，他卖给国家的余粮达两千五百多斤，乡亲们都称赞他“保持了八路军的老传统”。
    纪树发从1953年起担任村干部后，不仅个人生活朴素，还经常教育大家注意节俭。去年秋后，他带领近五百名社员到信安镇协助深翻土地。因为秋季粮食丰收，有些社员不注意节约粮食，甚至要一天吃五顿饭。纪树发就首先召开全队党员会议，接着又召集全体干部和群众大会，他在会上向大家说，我们过去少吃缺穿，现在刚攒了些粮食就要大吃大喝，这是不对的。应该省俭些，细水长流。他说：“我们应该在囤尖上省俭，不要在囤底下省吃。”经过讨论，大家一致认为纪树发讲的有道理！从此都自觉地省吃俭用。在深翻地结束以后，别的大队吃粮都超过很多，社员意见纷纷，惟有堂二里大队没有超过标准。
    纪树发说，自己现在是一个队的负责人之一，群众要我们管家，我们就应当勤勤恳恳地把这个家管理好。我们要时刻学习革命先烈和革命领袖们大公无私、艰苦朴素的优良品质，关心群众，把人民交给我们的事业办好。
