Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 25th: According to a report by "Dawn Daily," the Greek defense lawyers for Glezos and other defendants began fighting on the 25th to overturn the military court's verdict and release the defendants.

They are preparing to appeal to the Supreme Court on the 25th, requesting the revocation of the verdicts against Glezos, Voutchas, Singhrakis, Kakagiannis, Ragouzarijis, and others. Additionally, they will appeal to the Court of Appeals, seeking to overturn the verdict against Trikalinos. The defense lawyers intend to seize every opportunity to overturn this unjust verdict. They believe that successfully arguing that the military court's trial of Glezos and other democrats was invalid, thereby nullifying their sentences, would be an important step towards securing their freedom.

The Greek public is fighting for the release of Glezos and other patriots in various ways. One of these is the movement to immediately abolish the infamous Decree No. 375.

"Dawn Daily" reported that in the past five years, nearly forty democrats have been imprisoned under this decree. Fourteen democrats have already been sentenced to death and face the threat of execution at any time.

Various groups, political activists, and ordinary Greek people oppose Decree No. 375. Michotakis, a prominent activist of the bourgeois Liberal Party, stated in "Dawn Daily": "People of justice universally believe that this decree must be abolished immediately because it has brought losses to our country and democracy."

The Greek authorities have taken new retaliatory measures against the rising movement of the Greek people to defend democracy. On the 25th, the Athens police authorities began interrogating a group of democrats under various pretexts. In recent days, seven prominent leaders of the United Democratic Left Party have been arrested, including Stamatiadis, a member of the Executive Committee.

    格列索斯等的辩护律师准备上诉
    力争撤销希腊当局无理判决
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社雅典25日讯：据“黎明日报”报道，格列索斯和其他被告的希腊辩护律师25日开始为撤销军事法庭的判决和释放被告而斗争。
    他们准备在25日向最高法院上诉，要求撤销对格列索斯、武恰斯、辛格拉基斯、卡卡亚尼斯、拉古扎里吉斯等人的案件的判决，另外向上诉法院上诉，要求撤销对特里卡利诺斯的案件的判决。辩护律师们打算利用一切机会争取撤销这个非正义的判决。他们认为，如果能争取到宣布在军事法庭审讯格列索斯和其他民主人士是无效的，从而使对他们的判决作废，这就向着争取他们获得自由方面走出重要的一步。
    希腊公众争取释放格列索斯和其他爱国者的斗争方式是多种多样的。其中之一是争取立即废除臭名昭彰的第三百七十五号法令的运动。
    “黎明日报”报道，在最近五年中，有将近四十位民主人士根据这条法令被关进了监狱。十四位民主人士已经被判死刑，面临着随时被执行判决的威胁。
    反对第三百七十五号法令的有各种团体、政治活动家和希腊普通人民。资产阶级的自由党的著名活动家米乔塔基斯在“黎明日报”发表声明说：“公正的人们普遍认为，必须立即废除这条法令，因为这条法令给我们国家和民主带来了损失。”
    希腊当局对希腊人民保卫民主运动的高涨采取了新的报复措施。25日雅典警察当局以一些借口开始审讯一批民主人士。最近几天又逮捕了七个统一民主左翼党的著名领袖，其中有执行委员会委员斯塔马提阿迪斯。
