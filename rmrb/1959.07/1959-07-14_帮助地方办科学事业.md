    Help Local Areas Run Scientific Undertakings
    Jin Wen
    In order to meet the needs of the development of construction undertakings, and also to better develop the entire scientific undertaking, we must vigorously develop local scientific undertakings. Since last year, various localities have successively established scientific research institutions, and local scientific undertakings have greatly developed, which is a very good thing.
    Some local scientific undertakings have already gained a lot of experience in their development; some have already achieved experience in consolidation and improvement. The Jilin Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences strives to have older institutes lead newer institutes, and strives to have relevant production departments of universities and colleges provide assistance in terms of manpower and equipment, so that new scientific research institutions can be developed and consolidated. This is a practical approach. Many regions have the same conditions as the Jilin Branch, that is, there are relatively old research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, there are universities and colleges, and there are varying numbers of production units. The newly established scientific research institutions can, on the basis of self-reliance, seek their help. The Jilin Branch's experience in seeking assistance is to closely cooperate with all relevant parties.
    The practice of the Jilin Branch proves that extensive cooperation is of great benefit to newly established scientific research units, and also of great benefit to other units participating in the cooperation. In the cooperation, relatively old scientific research institutions, universities and colleges, and production departments can see the newly established scientific research institutions grow up around them in a short period of time, jointly shoulder the research topics stipulated by the state and local areas, and their own research work is thus developed, the old researchers are also tempered and improved, and the original equipment can also be fully utilized. This is such a gratifying thing.
    Such cooperation is also of great benefit to long-term scientific research work. If the newly established scientific research institutions in local areas are developed, grown, and consolidated, they can better carry out research work and vigorously promote local production and construction. With better conditions for various units to cooperate in scientific research, they will research more and better. Local scientific undertakings are an integral part of the national scientific undertaking, and with a foundation for local scientific undertakings, it is possible to better promote the development of the entire scientific undertaking. Therefore, the experience of the Jilin Branch is worthy of attention by scientific research institutions in other places. If the old scientific research institutions, universities and colleges, and production departments in other places can provide support and assistance to the newly established local scientific research institutions in cooperation, then the newly established scientific research institutions in local areas are likely to grow rapidly, which is conducive to the development of production and conducive to the entire scientific research undertaking.

    帮助地方办科学事业
    金文
    为了适应建设事业发展的需要，也为了更好地发展整个科学事业，就要大力发展地方科学事业。去年以来，各地纷纷建立了科学研究机构，地方科学事业有了很大的发展，这是很好的事情。
    有些地方科学事业，已在发展中得到了不少经验；有的已经取得了巩固和提高的经验。中国科学院吉林分院争取老所带新所，争取高等学校有关生产部门在人力、设备等方面给予帮助，使新的科学研究机构得到了发展和巩固。这是切合实际的办法。许多地区都有着和吉林分院一样的条件，即有着中国科学院的比较老的研究机构，有着高等院校以及多少不等的生产单位，新建的科学研究机构是可以在自力更生的基础上，争取它们的帮助的。吉林分院争取帮助的经验是，同各有关方面密切协作。
    吉林分院的实践证明，广泛协作，对新建的科学研究单位大有好处，对参加协作的其他单位也大有好处。比较老的科学研究机构、高等院校、生产部门在协作中，在短时期内，就可以看到自己身边新建的科学研究机构成长起来，共同负担起国家和地方所规定的研究课题，并且自身的研究工作也因而得到发展，老的研究人员也受到了锻炼和提高，原有设备还能够充分发挥作用，这是多么值得高兴的事。
    这样的协作，对长远的科学研究工作来说，也是大有好处的。地方上新建的科学研究机构发展、成长、巩固了，就可以更好地开展研究工作，有力地促进当地生产建设。各单位协作进行科学研究有了更好的条件，就将研究得更多更好。地方科学事业是全国科学事业的组成部分，地方科学事业有了基础，就有可能更好地推进整个科学事业的发展。因此，吉林分院的经验，值得其他地方的科学研究机关重视。其他地方老的科学研究机构、高等学校和生产部门，如果能够在协作中给新建的地方科学研究机构以支援和帮助，那末，地方的新建科学研究机构就有可能迅速成长，有利于发展生产，有利于整个科学研究事业。
