Polish Literary Works Published in China in Recent Years
　　Wang Jing
　　As early as fifty years ago, Lu Xun mentioned Adam Mickiewicz, Poland's greatest poet, in "On the Power of Mara Poetry." Later, he mentioned this poet several times, saying in the article "'Title Undecided' Draft": "... 'Introducing Polish Poets' began thirty years ago with my 'On the Power of Mara Poetry.' At that time, the Manchu Qing Dynasty ruled China, and the Han people were subjugated. China's situation was similar to Poland's, and reading their poems easily resonated with me...". Chinese readers have long been familiar with the name of this poet who sought national liberation and praised freedom. However, in old China, due to the reactionary ruling class's suppression and restriction of progressive culture, only three or five short poems of his works were introduced to our country. After liberation, we have translated and published many excellent Polish literary works. Mickiewicz's most famous long poem "Pan Tadeusz" was published by the People's Literature Publishing House as early as 1955 and met with readers. This long poem of nearly ten thousand lines, with Napoleon's invasion of Russia as its historical background, is permeated with the poet's lofty love for the motherland in every line from beginning to end, deeply moving. Subsequently, a collection of the poet's poems was published, including the long poems "Grazyna" and "Konrad Wallenrod." The latter is a historical story poem of Lithuania and Prussia, which calls for fighting for the freedom of the motherland. The poet created a hero, Wallenrod, who did not hesitate to sacrifice his life for the freedom of his people.
　　In addition, we have also translated and published a collection of short stories by Henryk Sienkiewicz, an outstanding Polish classical writer; a collection of short stories by Eliza Orzeszkowa, an outstanding Polish realist writer of the 19th century, and her novella "The Common People"; a collection of short stories by Bolesław Prus, an outstanding Polish realist writer, and his famous work "The Outpost"; as well as famous works in Polish modern literature, such as Niewerly's "A Man's Road." Novels by writers such as Konopnicka and plays by Kruczkowski have also been published in Chinese translations.
　　On the 15th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Poland, the People's Literature Publishing House has published four more famous Polish literary works. These four new books are Orzeszkowa's "Marta," "Reymont's Collection of Short Stories," Dąbrowska's "Nights and Days," and "Kruczkowski's Collection of Plays." Niewerly's "A Man's Road" has also been republished.
　　Eliza Orzeszkowa is a Polish writer who has become familiar to Chinese readers in recent years. "Marta" is one of her most outstanding works. In the second half of the 19th century, Poland was actually ruled by the bourgeoisie and petty nobles, and capitalism developed rapidly. In such a country, the lives and experiences of ordinary people were tragic. In Orzeszkowa's works, a recurring theme is the unfortunate fate of women. With infinite sympathy, the author depicts the lives and experiences of women and explores the reasons for their suffering with a very serious attitude. "Mr. Graba," "One-Fourteenth," "The Ceierce Family," "Good People," and "The Hollow" are all works with the theme of the different tragic fates of women of various classes and types, and the most outstanding of these is "Marta." This novel was written in 1872 and aroused enthusiastic responses among readers in Poland and abroad after its publication. The protagonist, Marta, is a highly typical figure. Originally protected by her father and husband, she lived a life free from worries about food and clothing, but a sudden change – her husband's death – immediately pushed her to face the ruthless reality. Her past life and education left her without the ability to work, so when she faced the cold reality of capitalist society, she was bound to fall into despair. Through Marta's experience, the author nakedly exposes the cruelty of capitalism.
　　Reymont was also an outstanding Polish realist writer of the 19th century and the author of the novel "The Peasants." Because the author consistently adhered to the realistic creative method, his works truthfully reflected the face of old Poland. His works are mostly themed with praising the labor of the working class and exposing the ugly nature of the bourgeoisie, so they have been welcomed by the Polish people for many years. "Reymont's Collection of Short Stories" includes five works written by the author between 1897 and 1900, all of which are excellent.
　　The works of the modern Polish female writer Maria Dąbrowska are extremely rich and cherished by a wide range of readers. She is not only an excellent Polish writer, but also an outstanding social activist who actively participates in the peace movement. Her novel "Nights and Days" is an epic depicting Polish social life. It broadly depicts the lives of all classes in Poland from the Polish national uprising in 1863 to the eve of the First World War in 1914, and portrays the fate of several generations of a family. Polish critics unanimously gave this novel a high evaluation.
　　The author of "Kruczkowski's Collection of Plays" is a famous modern Polish writer. Before the Second World War, Kruczkowski actively participated in the anti-fascist movement to defend peace. During the war, he spent five years in a German concentration camp. After Poland's liberation, he returned to his motherland. In 1948, he served as the Deputy Minister of Culture and Art of Poland, and in 1949, he served as the Chairman of the Polish Writers' Association. Kruczkowski's pre-war creations were mostly novels, while in the post-war period, his creations turned to drama. His creations are closely linked to the current reality, expressing his attitude towards major events around him with surging enthusiasm. This collection includes three plays he wrote after the war. Among them, "The Germans" won the first prize of the Polish National Award in 1950.

    我国近年来出版的波兰文学作品
    王靖
    远在五十年前，鲁迅就曾在“摩罗诗力说”中谈到过波兰最伟大的诗人亚当·密茨凯维支，后来他又曾几次谈到过这位诗人，在“‘题未定’草”一文中曾说：“……‘绍介波兰诗人’，还在三十年前，始于我的‘摩罗诗力说’。那时满清宰华，汉民受制，中国境遇，颇类波兰，读其诗歌，即易于心心相印，……”。这位希求民族解放，歌颂自由的诗人的名字中国读者早熟悉了，但是在旧中国，由于反动统治阶级对进步文化的扼杀和限制，他的作品介绍到我国来的只有三、五首短诗。解放后，我们翻译出版了不少优秀的波兰文学作品，密茨凯维支最著名的长诗“塔杜施先生”，早在1955年已由人民文学出版社出版和读者见面了。这本将近万行的长诗，以拿破仑进攻俄国为历史背景，从开始到结束，每行诗里都渗透了诗人对祖国的崇高热爱，感人至深。随后又出版了诗人的诗集，包括长诗“格拉席娜”与“康拉德·华伦洛德”。后者是一篇立陶宛和普鲁士的历史故事诗，它号召为祖国的自由而斗争。诗人塑造了一个为争取祖国人民获得自由，不惜牺牲自己生命的英雄华伦洛德。
    此外，我们还曾经翻译出版了波兰杰出古典作家亨利克·显克微支的短篇小说集；波兰十九世纪卓越的现实主义作家艾丽查·奥若什科娃的短篇小说集和她的中篇小说“乡下佬”；波兰杰出的现实主义作家普鲁斯的短篇小说集和他的名著“前哨”；以及波兰现代文学中的著名作品，聂维尔利的“一个人的道路”等。柯诺普尼茨卡等作家的小说，克鲁奇科夫斯基的剧本，我国也都曾先后有译本出版。
    在波兰人民共和国十五周年国庆，人民文学出版社又出版四本波兰文学名著。这四种新书是奥若什科娃的“马尔达”、“莱蒙特短篇小说集”、董博罗芙斯卡的“黑夜与白昼”、“克鲁奇科夫斯基戏剧集”。聂维尔利的“一个人的道路”也重新再版。
    艾丽查·奥若什科娃是近几年我国读者已经熟悉了的波兰作家。“马尔达”是她最出色的作品之一。十九世纪后半期的波兰，实际上是由资产阶级与小贵族统治着，资本主义得到了迅速发展。在这样的国家中，普通人民的生活和遭遇是悲惨的。在奥若什科娃的作品中，时常出现的主题是广大妇女的不幸的命运。作者怀着无限的同情，描写了妇女们的生活与遭遇，以极严肃的态度探讨她们苦难的原因。“格拉巴先生”、“十四分之一”、“崔尔采一家”、“善良的人们”、“洼地”等，都是以各个阶层、不同类型的妇女的不同的悲惨命运为主题的作品，而其中最杰出的一部是“马尔达”。这部小说写于1872年，出版以后在波兰和在国外的读者中引起了热烈的反应。作品的主角马尔达是一个富有典型意义的形象。她原来受到父亲和丈夫的保护，过着衣食无忧的生活，但是突然的变化——丈夫的死亡——立即把她推到无情的现实面前。已往的生活与教育使她没有劳动能力，因此，当她面对资本主义社会的冷酷现实时，便必然陷于绝境。作者通过马尔达的遭遇，把资本主义的残酷赤裸裸地暴露出来。
    莱蒙特也是波兰十九世纪卓越的现实主义作家，是小说“农民”的作者。由于作者始终不渝地遵循着现实主义创作方法，所以他的作品真实地反映了旧波兰的面貌。他的作品多是以歌颂工人阶级的劳动，揭露资产阶级的丑恶本质为主题，所以多少年来一直受到波兰人民的欢迎。“莱蒙特短篇小说集”共收入作者1897—1900年间所写的作品五篇，都是优秀之作。
    波兰现代女作家玛丽亚·董博罗芙斯卡的作品极其丰富，为广大读者所珍视。她不仅是一个波兰的优秀作家，而且也是一个积极参加和平运动的卓越的社会活动家。她的长篇小说“黑夜与白昼”，是描写波兰社会生活的史诗。它广泛地描写了从1863年波兰民族起义到1914年第一次世界大战前夕期间，波兰各阶层的生活面貌，刻划出一个家族几代人的命运。波兰评论家一致给予这部小说很高的评价。
    “克鲁奇科夫斯基戏剧集”的作者是波兰现代著名的作家。第二次世界大战以前，克鲁奇科夫斯基就积极地参加了反法西斯保卫和平的运动，战争期间他在德国集中营里度过了五年，波兰解放后回到祖国，1948年曾担任波兰文化艺术部副部长，1949年曾任波兰作家协会主席。克鲁奇科夫斯基战前的创作大多是小说，战后时期，他的创作转向戏剧方面。他的创作紧紧地结合着当前的现实生活，以澎湃的热情表达了自己对周围重大事件的态度。这本集子中收入他战后所写的三个剧本。其中“德国人”一剧，曾获得1950年波兰国家奖金一等奖。
