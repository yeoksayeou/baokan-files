The scientific research activities in rural areas are an integral part of production measures and closely follow production. Agricultural production is highly seasonal, and time cannot be wasted for even a moment. Therefore, for scientific research activities in rural areas to play a significant role and to truly integrate closely with production and promptly address issues raised in production, it is essential to grasp the seasonal nature and seize the opportune moment. If the opportune moment is not seized, and research on management issues is only conducted when crops are about to be harvested, it may be useful for next year, but it will not contribute to this year's harvest.

Agricultural scientific research activities themselves are also subject to seasonal restrictions. To observe spring crops, it can only be done in spring; to record wheat flowering, it can only be done during the wheat flowering season. Failure to seize the opportune moment means that research that could have been completed this year will have to wait until next year.

The reason why the scientific research activities of the Patriotic People's Commune in Shou County have unleashed such power, and why the research institute is affectionately called "Crop Leader" by the commune members, lies in their timeliness. They have different arrangements for spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

The active promotion of scientific research activities by people's communes across the country is due to the emergence of various issues, large and small, in agricultural production practice at any time and any place. It is impossible to rely entirely on professional scientific research institutions to solve these many problems, requiring that they be resolved locally and promptly as much as possible. Therefore, the approach of the Patriotic People's Commune in Shou County is necessary and can be used as a reference.

    贵在及时
    农村的科学研究活动是生产措施的组成部分，是紧跟生产走的。农业生产的季节性很大，时机一刻也放松不得。所以，农村的科学研究活动要很好地发挥作用，要真正做到紧密结合生产，及时解决生产上提出来的问题，也就必须掌握季节性，抓紧时机。要不抓紧时机，庄稼快收割了，才研究出管理期的问题，固然明年还有用，但对今年的收成已于事无补。
    农业科学研究活动本身，也受季节性的限制。要观察春季的作物，就只能在春季，要记载小麦扬花的情况，就只能在小麦扬花的时节。要不抓紧时机，本来今年可以完成的研究，就得等待明年。
    寿县爱国人民公社的科学研究活动之所以发挥了威力，研究所被社员们亲切地称为“庄稼头”，就是贵在及时。春、夏、秋、冬，他们各有安排。
    各地人民公社的积极开展科学研究活动，是因为农业生产实践中会随时随地出现大大小小的各种各样的问题，而这许多问题不可能完全依靠专业科学研究机关去解决，要求尽可能就地及时解决。所以，寿县爱国人民公社的做法是必要的，可供借镜。
