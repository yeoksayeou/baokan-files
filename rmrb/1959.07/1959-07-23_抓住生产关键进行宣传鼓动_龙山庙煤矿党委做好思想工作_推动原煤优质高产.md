Grasp Key Production Aspects for Propaganda and Mobilization
Longshanmiao Coal Mine Party Committee Does Good Ideological Work to Promote High-Quality, High-Yield Raw Coal

    This newspaper reports As the red banner emulation campaign for high-quality, high-yield raw coal deepens, strengthening the Party's propaganda and mobilization work is increasingly necessary in every production link of coal mining enterprises. The Party Committee of Longshanmiao Mine in Pingdingshan, Henan, analyzed and studied this new situation, adopting the method of summarizing last year's experience in carrying out propaganda and mobilization work and solving the problems existing in the current propaganda work. This quickly set off a high tide of propaganda and mobilization work, promoting the development of the red banner emulation campaign for high-quality, high-yield raw coal.
    On the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year, after Pingdingshan Coal Mine emphasized that all work must be more practical and meticulous, the Party's propaganda and mobilization work once experienced a dull period. The reason was that in the previous period, leaders emphasized grasping production more (which was correct), relaxing political education and propaganda and mobilization work; some work areas inappropriately reduced propaganda work cadres. Thus, the Party's propaganda and mobilization work saw a phenomenon of no arrangements, no inspections, and relaxed leadership at all levels.
    The Party Committee analyzed the above situation, believing that not solving these problems ideologically would not only affect the development of propaganda work, but more importantly, would affect the further development of the red banner emulation campaign for high-quality, high-yield raw coal. Therefore, it adopted the method of following the mass line, first organizing everyone to speak out and debate on the problems exposed in propaganda and mobilization work, and held worker symposiums to understand the opinions and requirements of the masses. Through understanding the demands of the masses and speaking out and debating, everyone unanimously recognized that propaganda and mobilization work in enterprises should be carried out in a vigorous and lively manner at all times. Adopting forms that the masses love to see and hear and are rich and colorful, commending the advanced, and constantly inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses is an important aspect of promoting the continuous progress of the red banner emulation campaign for high-quality, high-yield.
    After clarifying the important significance of propaganda and mobilization work, how to deeply carry out propaganda and mobilization work at the coal face underground is a new topic that needs to be studied. In the past, there were more propaganda activities above ground and fewer propaganda activities underground; more general propaganda and less propaganda and mobilization focused on production issues. In order to solve this problem, the Party Committee adopted the method of grasping typical examples and using points to lead the whole area. First, it helped the First Mining Area summarize the experience of underground propaganda work, and then held an on-site meeting to promote it. At the same time, taking the development of the red banner emulation for high-quality, high-yield raw coal as the content, it organized inspections of the development of propaganda work, thus greatly promoting the development of propaganda work in each work area of the entire mine.
    In the red banner emulation campaign for high-quality, high-yield raw coal, carrying out diverse forms of propaganda in conjunction with key issues in production is the main feature of this mine's propaganda and mobilization work. Each work area has carried out propaganda work in different forms according to the different problems found in its own production and infrastructure construction. For example, in the First Mining Area, during the organization of the high-quality, high-yield red banner emulation campaign, it was discovered that electric chute chip accidents were a key issue affecting increased production and savings. They hung slogan signs on the electric chute drivers saying, "Electric chute drivers should pay attention, be vigilant about chip accidents, strive for high production with safe transportation, and guarantee a 10,000-ton face of raw coal." At the same time, they educated drivers to improve their working methods, changing from sitting to driving while maintaining, thus greatly reducing chip accidents. In terms of carrying out increased production and savings, the propagandists put forward the slogans "Material recovery is complete, floating coal is completely removed, and pillars are completely recovered." This achieved good results in saving pit wood, with pillar recovery reaching 95%, reducing pit wood consumption by 53% compared to the original. In early June alone, the entire work area saved nearly twenty cubic meters of pit wood. In terms of the quality of raw coal, after carrying out the "three sorting" movement (coal pickers sort, electric chute drivers sort, and transportation workers sort), the original gangue content of 1.8% was reduced to 0.45%, achieving the requirements of high-quality, high-yield raw coal.

    抓住生产关键进行宣传鼓动
    龙山庙煤矿党委做好思想工作　推动原煤优质高产
    本报讯　随着原煤优质高产红旗竞赛运动的深入开展，在煤矿企业管理的各个生产环节上，愈来愈需要加强党的宣传鼓动工作。河南平顶山龙山庙矿党委分析研究了这种新的形势，采取总结去年开展宣传鼓动工作的经验与解决当前宣传工作中存在问题的办法，迅速掀起了宣传鼓动工作的高潮，推动了原煤优质高产红旗竞赛运动的开展。
    平顶山煤矿在去年大跃进的基础上，各项工作强调必须更加踏实、细致以后，党的宣传鼓动工作曾一度出现了沉闷现象。原因是前一时期领导上强调抓生产的多（这是对的），放松了政治教育和宣传鼓动工作；有的工区不适当地减少宣传工作干部。这样，就使党的宣传鼓动工作出现了无布置、无检查，层层放松领导的现象。
    党委分析了上述情况，认为不从思想上解决这些问题，不仅影响宣传工作的开展，更重要的是影响进一步开展原煤优质高产的红旗竞赛运动。因此，采取了走群众路线的办法，首先针对宣传鼓动工作中暴露出的问题，组织大家鸣放辩论，并召开了工人座谈会，了解群众的意见与要求。通过了解群众要求和鸣放辩论，大家一致认识到企业中的宣传鼓动工作，什么时候都应当轰轰烈烈热气腾腾；采用群众喜闻乐见的、丰富多彩的形式，表扬先进，不断鼓舞群众干劲，它是推动优质高产红旗竞赛运动不断前进的一个重要方面。
    在明确了宣传鼓动工作的重要意义以后，如何深入开展井下掌子面的宣传鼓动工作，又是需要研究的新课题。过去的情况是：井上宣传活动多，井下宣传活动少；一般的宣传多，针对生产问题宣传鼓动少。为了解决这一问题，党委采取了抓典型，以点带面的方法，首先，帮助一采区总结了井下宣传工作的经验，接着召开了现场会议，进行推广。同时，以开展原煤优质高产红旗竞赛为内容，组织检查了宣传工作开展的情况，从而大大促进了全矿各工区宣传工作的开展。
    在原煤优质高产的红旗竞赛运动中，结合生产中的关键问题，开展形式多样的宣传，是这个矿宣传鼓动工作的主要特点。各个工区都根据自己生产基建中发现的不同问题，采取不同形式开展了宣传工作。如一采区在组织优质高产红旗竞赛运动中，发现电溜子切屑事故是影响增产节约的关键问题，他们就在电溜司机那里挂上“电溜司机应注意，切屑事故要警惕，安全运输争高产，保证原煤万吨面”的标语牌；同时教育司机改进工作方法，由坐着开改为边开边维护，这样，切屑事故大大减少。在开展增产节约方面，宣传员们提出了“材料回收光，浮煤出光，柱子回收光”的口号，对节约坑木收到了良好效果，柱子回收达到了95％，比原来坑木消耗降低53％。仅6月上旬，全工区即节约坑木近二十立方。在原煤质量上，开展“三拣”运动后（擢煤工拣，电溜司机拣，运输工拣），由原来含矸率1.8％降低到0.45％，达到了原煤优质高产的要求。
