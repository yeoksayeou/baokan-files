Athletes from All Ethnic Groups Form Delegations
Xinjiang, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Guizhou Athletes Prepare to Participate in the National Games

    (Our dispatch) The delegations from Xinjiang, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Guizhou, participating in the National Games, have been formed. This team includes outstanding athletes from various ethnic groups, symbolizing the great unity of the sons and daughters of all ethnic groups in our country.

    The Xinjiang delegation includes 215 outstanding athletes from nine ethnic groups, including Uygur, Kazakh, Han, Hui, Xibe, Daur, Mongolian, Tatar, and Russian. Among them is a 65-year-old martial arts hero, as well as a 13-year-old little equestrian. The delegation includes Serik, the national freestyle wrestling heavyweight champion, as well as Dadaning and Aulas, who set national records for the 10,000-meter and 5,000-meter horse races. Most of the members of the Xinjiang delegation are young newcomers, and due to their diligent study and hard practice, their recent performances have made rapid progress. For example, most of the members of the track and field team did not meet the standards of graded athletes. After a period of training, most of them have passed the standards of second- or first-class athletes in recent tests.

    The selection work for the First National Games in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region started in January this year and has now been completed. The selection work started from the grassroots level, and the number of athletes participating in various levels of selection reached about 50,000. Through layer-by-layer selection, not only have many talented new athletes emerged, but it has also promoted mass sports in the autonomous region. For example, horse races have been held in almost all pastoral areas of the autonomous region.

    The Qinghai Province delegation is composed of more than 200 athletes from eight ethnic groups including Han, Hui, Tibetan, Salar, Tu, Manchu, Korean, and Mongolian. They will participate in eighteen competition events including table tennis, badminton, polo, track and field, road cycling, gymnastics, weightlifting, martial arts, Chinese wrestling, archery, Chinese chess, horse racing, obstacle horse racing, shooting, motorcycle off-road, radio transmitting and receiving, gliding, and aviation models, as well as fencing performances.

    Many projects in this team are composed of a mix of ethnic groups. For example, the archery team is composed of outstanding athletes from the Han, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups. Zaxi Wenmao, a 17-year-old Tibetan girl, is outstanding in the track and field team. She has only practiced grenade throwing for more than half a year, but her current score has increased from the original 36 meters to 51.97 meters, approaching the national record. The oldest member of the Qinghai delegation is 51-year-old Lu Ruifang (Hui), who was selected as a member of the martial arts team with his daughter Lu Yanzhi and son Lu Zhide, which is a great story.

    The Yunnan team includes 329 male and female athletes from 13 ethnic groups, who will participate in more than 20 events including ball games, track and field, gymnastics, weightlifting, and shooting, martial arts, as well as wrestling, fencing, and water motorcycle racing performances.

    Among the members of the delegation, there are 16 master athletes and 109 first-class athletes. Among them are Ma Xianglong, the national record holder for the men's high jump and a master athlete, Su Wenren, who set the latest national records for the 10,000-meter, 5,000-meter, and 3,000-meter races, and Qi Yufang, a master gymnast.

    The Guizhou Province delegation includes 345 male and female athletes from ethnic groups such as Han, Miao, Buyi, Yi, Hui, Dong, and Shui. They will participate in more than 20 competitions including basketball, volleyball, table tennis, handball, polo, track and field, road cycling, gymnastics, acrobatics, weightlifting, swimming, rowing, archery, Chinese chess, Go, horse racing, obstacle horse racing, shooting, motorcycle off-road, and motorcycle ring road racing.

    At present, the sports teams are stepping up training and studying hard in order to rapidly improve the technical level of various sports and strive to create good results in the National Games. For example, the table tennis and track and field teams of the Qinghai delegation have successively visited Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Beijing and other places to absorb advanced experiences from various places and further improve their skills. The Guizhou women's basketball team, women's volleyball team, women's handball team, and men's volleyball team, which have won the right to participate in the National Games ball games finals, are summarizing the experience and lessons learned from participating in the regional preliminaries on the one hand, and stepping up training on the other.

    各族健儿组成代表队
    新疆青海云南贵州选手准备参加全运会
    本报讯　参加全运会的新疆、青海、云南和贵州的代表队已分别组成。这支队伍，包括各个民族的优秀选手，象征着我国各族儿女的大团结。
    新疆代表队，包括有维吾尔族、哈萨克族、汉族、回族、锡伯族、达斡尔族、蒙古族、塔塔尔族、俄罗斯族等九个民族的二百一十五名优秀选手。其中有六十五高龄的武术老英雄，也有十三岁的小骑士。代表队中有获得自由式摔跤的重量级全国冠军色热克，也有创造一万和五千米赛马全国最好成绩的达旦宁和奥拉斯。新疆代表队的队员大部分都是年青的新手，由于他们勤学苦练，最近的成绩都有飞跃的进展。如田径队里原先大部分队员都未达到等级运动员标准，经过前一时期的训练，在最近的测验中，已经大部分通过了二级或一级运动员的标准。
    新疆维吾尔自治区参加第一届全国运动会的选拔工作，从今年1月份开始，到现在已经全部结束。选拔工作是从最基层开始的，参加各级选拔的运动员人数约达五万人之多。通过层层选拔，不仅涌现出很多有才能的运动新手，对自治区的群众性体育运动也起了推动作用。如在自治区各牧业区，几乎都举行过赛马。
    青海省的代表队是由汉族、回族、藏族、撒拉族、土族、满族、朝鲜族、蒙古族等八个民族的二百多名运动员组成的。他（她）们将参加乒乓球、羽毛球、马球、田径、公路自行车、体操、举重、武术、中国式摔跤、射箭、中国象棋、赛马、障碍赛马、射击、摩托车越野、无线电收发报、滑翔、航空模型等十八个竞赛项目和击剑表演。
    这支队伍中的许多项目，都是由各族人民混合组成的。如射箭队就是由汉族、藏族、回族三个民族的优秀选手组成的。在田径队中成绩突出的有十七岁的藏族姑娘札西文毛，她练习手榴弹掷远的时间只有半年多，但是现在的成绩已从原来的三十六米提高到五十一点九七米，接近了全国纪录。青海代表队中年岁最大的是五十一岁的吕瑞芳
  （回族），这次他同女儿吕延芝、儿子吕志德都被选为武术队的队员，成为佳话。
    云南队包括有十三个民族的三百二十九名男、女运动员，他们将参加球类、田径、体操、举重、射击、武术等二十多个项目的比赛，以及摔跤、击剑、水上摩托赛艇等项表演赛。
    在代表队队员中，有运动健将十六名，一级运动员一百零九名。其中有男子跳高全国纪录保持者、运动健将马翔龙，有创造一万米、五千米、三千米赛跑全国最新成绩的苏文仁和体操运动健将戚玉芳等。
    贵州省代表队包括汉族、苗族、布衣族、彝族、回族、侗族、水族等民族的三百四十五名男、女运动员。他们将参加篮球、排球、乒乓球、手球、马球、田径、公路自行车、体操、技巧、举重、游泳、赛艇、射箭、中国象棋、围棋、赛马、障碍赛马、射击、摩托车越野、摩托车环行公路等二十多个项目的竞赛。
    目前，各运动队正加紧锻炼，刻苦学习，以期迅速提高各项运动技术水平，争取全运会上创造良好成绩。如青海代表队的乒乓球、田径等队，已先后赴西安、郑州、北京等地进行访问，以便吸取各地先进经验，进一步提高技术。取得全运会球类决赛权的贵州省女子篮球队、女子排球队、女子手球队和男子排球队，正在一方面总结参加分区预赛的经验和教训，一方面加紧进行训练。（附图片）
