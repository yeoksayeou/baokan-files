People with Special Pig-Raising Skills

    Chen Kai, a breeder from Mudong People's Commune in Ba County, Chongqing, has an unusual skill: he specializes in raising thin and sick pigs that are difficult to feed. Without any medicine or special feed, he can raise pigs that are as thin as skeletons into fat, healthy ones.

    One afternoon after a rainstorm, we arrived at Chen Kai's famous "Pig Sanatorium."

    The sanatorium is a desolate hillside, separated from other pastures by a low earthen wall. After entering, there were groups of white and black pigs everywhere, under the big trees and by the stream. Some were running, some were eating, and none of them looked sick.

    Walking into the "Director's Office," I saw an old man, nearly fifty years old, squatting on the ground, washing mange off a sick pig. He was so focused on washing that he didn't notice our arrival at all.

    "This is Chen Kai," the comrade who came with me said.

    Then, Chen Kai introduced his feeding methods to us. His main secret is careful management. For general sick pigs, he adopted a regular "eating, exercise, and sleep" method, releasing them in the morning and bringing them back in the evening, feeding them twice a day – half full in the morning and letting them eat their fill in the evening. For particularly serious sick pigs, he pointed to the pig he had been washing earlier and said, "We send them to the 'Special Pig Pen' for individual care." As he spoke, the alarm clock on the table suddenly rang. Chen Kai smiled and said, "Dinner time." He walked out the door, stood on the hillside, and called out in his special tone: "Cluck...cluck...cluck..." With this call, before long, groups of pigs swarmed from all directions, running towards the pig troughs in groups of four and seven. Chen Kai walked back and forth among the pigs, touching this pig and then touching that pig, constantly adjusting the pigs' feeding positions. He said with a smile: "Adjusting them like this, letting the pigs that are full outside eat less, and those that are not full eat more, makes it less likely for them to get sick from eating."

    Chen Kai was transferred from the army, where he was originally a breeder. He had long held a beautiful wish to become a road construction worker. He wanted to wield a sledgehammer and build roads leading in all directions, greatly changing the face of Sichuan Province, where transportation was inconvenient. But when he heard what the Party Branch Secretary told him when he requested a job transfer, he understood the importance of developing pig production to change the face of his hometown, so he settled down to do this work well.

    One day, the Party Branch Secretary told him that many pigs in the team were very sick and asked him if he could think of a solution. He said, "Find a veterinarian to treat them!" The Branch Secretary said, "Veterinarians can only treat individual pigs, so we must think of a way to treat collectively sick pigs." He listened to the Branch Secretary's words and felt that it made sense. Coincidentally, a few of the pigs he was raising at the time were not normal, so he tried every means to treat them, but it was not effective. He was restless, constantly visiting doctors and seeking medicine, but he couldn't figure anything out.

    One holiday, he went to the market in town and happened to encounter a health propaganda team. He heard the propagandist say that as long as people exercise regularly, they will increase their resistance and get sick less often. He suddenly thought, could pigs do this too? When he returned home, he began to release the pigs from their pens frequently, while also paying attention to observing the pigs' living habits, and finally developed a whole set of methods for treating sick pigs. Soon his pigs not only recovered from their illnesses but also grew fat and healthy. After this experience spread, people brought thin and sick pigs that were difficult to raise to him, and he could cure almost all of them. With the support of the team, he further summarized his experience and officially established the "Pig Sanatorium." (Attached image)

    有特种养猪本领的人
    重庆巴县木洞人民公社的饲养员陈凯有一种不平常的本事：专养不好喂的瘦猪、病猪；不用什么药，也不要什么特殊的饲料，就能把骨瘦如柴的猪养得肥肥胖胖的。
    一个雨后初晴的下午，我们来到了陈凯的这所有名的“猪疗养院”。
    疗养院是一个荒凉的山坡，一堵矮土墙把它和另外的牧场隔离开来。进场后，不论在大树下、小溪旁，到处是白色和黑色的猪群。有的在奔跑，有的在吃食，一点也不像有病的样子。
    走进“院长办公室”，我见一位年近半百的老人，正蹲在地下给一头病猪洗癞子。他洗得那样专心，一点也没觉察到我们的来到。
    “这就是陈凯。”跟我一起来的同志对我说。
    接着，陈凯向我们介绍了他的饲养方法。他的主要秘方是精心管理。对于一般的病猪，他采取了有规律的“吃饭、运动和睡觉”的办法，早晨放出去，晚上收回来，早晚喂两次猪食——早晨喂半饱，晚上尽猪吃。对于特别严重的病猪，他指着刚才那条猪说，“就把它们送入‘特等猪圈’单独照管。”说着，桌上的闹钟忽然叮叮当当地响起来，陈凯笑着说，“开晚饭了。”他走出门，站在山坡上，拖着特有的音调：“咯……咯……咯……”这么一唤，不一会，群猪便从四面八方拥来，四个一堆，七个一群的向猪槽跑去。陈凯便在猪群中往来逡巡，一会摸摸这头猪，一会又摸摸那头猪，不时的调动着猪吃食的地方。他笑着说：“这样调换调换，让在外面吃饱了的猪少吃，没有吃饱的多吃，就不容易吃病。”
    陈凯是从部队里转业回来的，原来担任饲养员。因为他老早就有一个美好的愿望，想当一名修路工人。他想抡起铁锤，到处修上四通八达的公路，把交通不便的四川省的面貌大大改变。但当他听过党总支书记在他请求调动工作时对他讲的一席话，他了解到发展生猪生产对改变家乡面貌的重要意义，于是他安下心来，要做好这个工作。
    有一天，党支部书记告诉他，全队有不少猪病得很厉害，问他能不能想个办法。他说：“找兽医医嘛！”支部书记说：“兽医只能医个别的，必须想个医集体病猪的办法。”他听了支部书记的话，觉得也很有道理。恰巧，那时他喂的猪有几只不正常，他便想方设法给它们医治，可是一直不见效。他坐卧不宁，成天四处访医寻药，也没搞出个名堂。
    一个假日，他到镇上赶场，正碰着卫生宣传队，他听宣传员说，只要经常运动运动，就会增强抵抗力，少害病。他忽然想到，猪可不可以这样呢？回到家里，他便开始经常把猪放出圈来，同时注意观察猪的生活规律，终于研究出了一整套疗养生猪的办法。不久他的猪不但病好了，而且长得肥肥胖胖的。这一经验传开来以后，人们都纷纷把一些不易喂养的瘦猪、病猪，送到他那里去，差不多他都能治好。在队的支持下，他进一步总结了经验，便正式成立了“猪疗养院”。（附图片）
