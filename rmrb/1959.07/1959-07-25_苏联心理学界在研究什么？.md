What is the Soviet Psychological Community Studying?
Xu Liancang

From June 29th to July 4th, the All-Soviet Psychological Society held its first congress in Moscow. The congress reported and discussed the scientific research achievements of psychologists in recent years, as well as how the psychological community should respond to the call of the Soviet Communist Party to strive for the realization of the grand Seven-Year Plan. There were 173 official representatives and 347 non-voting delegates attending the conference, as well as 28 foreign psychologists invited to the conference. More than 130 scientific reports were read at the meeting. In addition, there were more than 80 papers that were not reported due to time constraints but were included in the report collection. Three volumes of the report collection were published. Academician Smirnov made a report at the plenary session on "The Spirit of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the Tasks of Psychology," which comprehensively discussed the achievements of Soviet psychologists in scientific research and teaching in recent years. He particularly emphasized the urgency of psychology serving practice, pointing out that cooperating with the Party Central Committee's proposed reform of the education system is a glorious task for psychologists, and that psychologists cannot stand idly by in matters related to labor production and medical health. This spirit of combining theory with practice also runs through the entire agenda of the conference. For example, eight reports and discussions were held on the psychological issues related to primary and secondary school education and teaching, with a total of 45 papers presented; three reports and discussions were held on labor psychology, with a total of 15 papers presented; three reports and discussions were held on medical psychology, with a total of 16 papers presented; and two reports and discussions were held on defectology, with a total of 9 papers presented. The above-mentioned reports on practical issues totaled 85, accounting for more than 65% of all reports. Soviet psychologists have also carried out many valuable studies in theoretical issues. For example, the general psychology and psychophysiology group held seven meetings and presented 36 papers. Special reports and discussions were also held on child psychology, comparative psychology, and the history of psychology. In the research on psychology for primary and secondary school education and teaching, some work is directly related to the topic of students participating in labor production. The reports in this area include: the formation and change of students' personality in the process of participating in agricultural production labor (Sherivanov, Kirienko, etc.), the development of students' active will in agricultural labor (Krasnodar), the study of the motives of senior students participating in production labor (Nadjimov), and the formation of interest in senior students participating in production labor (Dovgaro), etc. In these reports, the authors generally grasped some key issues for research, in order to clarify what are the benefits of students' participation in labor to their personality development, why there are benefits, and how to more effectively utilize these beneficial conditions, etc. For example, some psychologists have specifically studied the impact of the quality of labor organization on the speed of formation of various excellent qualities of students participating in labor. They believe that it is not enough to simply put students into production to solve all problems, but also requires proper arrangement and scientific research. In addition, participation in production should be closely integrated with regular class learning, so that production activities not only do not hinder regular class learning, but also help to better grasp the knowledge of regular class learning. Some psychologists have found that the attention cultivated in production, the practical significance and effect of knowledge seen in production, all have a positive effect on students' regular class learning. Moreover, they believe that production requires a high degree of discipline, strong will, and creative thinking, and the acquisition of these qualities is also beneficial to regular class learning. Therefore, it is necessary to consciously strengthen the cultivation of these qualities when students participate in production labor. Some psychologists have also raised some problems discovered in students' participation in labor to a theoretical level. For example, they studied the relationship between the "external difficulties" (such as heat, heavy rain, and fatigue, etc.) encountered by students when participating in agricultural labor and their subjective reflection, that is, "internal difficulties" (such as conflicts between various contradictory emotions), and how to solve these problems, etc.
    Another part of the work is to study the methods of production teaching more specifically, in order to help students master production knowledge and skills faster and better. The reports in this area include: the psychological research of teaching work in the teaching of production labor in ordinary schools (Guriyanov, etc.), the psychological characteristics of the transfer of production skills of senior students (Milerian), the individual differences in the formation of production skills of senior students (Mistyuk), the role of labor in mastering botanical knowledge (Kudryavtseva), etc. In these reports, the reporters discussed effective teaching methods based on experimental materials. In addition, there are many research reports on the problems of regular class teaching and the problems of teaching and intellectual development.
    In terms of educational psychology, most of the reports discussed the issue of students' personality development, paying particular attention to the impact of the collective on their personality development, such as the relationship between student collectives and student personality development (Shmirman), the formation of individual characteristics of students in boarding schools and their relationship with the collective (Zhevoronko), the psychological issues of modeling (Rurotsky), and the development of moral qualities (Vikinov, etc.).
    Some aspects of labor psychology are theoretical reports. For example, on the issue of labor activities and production operations (Chusyanin), the reporter cited materials from actual work to clarify what role the research of labor psychology can play in production, and at the same time analyzed the characteristics of production operations and the relationship between workers' labor activities and production operations, and further discussed the development prospects of production—automation—and the role of labor psychology in it. Regarding engineering psychology, Leontiev et al., in their report "Dynamic Principles in the Psychological Research of Automated Institutions," criticized the mechanistic errors in the concept of "a unified system of man and machine" in the "engineering psychology" of modern bourgeois psychologists. There are also special reports on the role of consciousness in labor activities. Grelstein discussed the dialectical relationship between conscious and unconscious components in labor activities in his report. Based on the study of "time perception," he explained that psychologists, with the help of special training methods, can make some imperceptible feelings clearer (such as the perception of extremely short periods of time), thereby promoting the mastery of certain skills.
    In research directly related to production labor, labor psychologists put their efforts on the most important topics of the moment. For example, Suvorova et al. studied the psychological issues of product quality and the time to complete operations in conveyor belt production. Psychological research on production process control (Pushkin) discussed a new problem in current production—remote control—the psychological problems in it. The reporter studied the operation of a transportation hub control station, and discussed the various professional psychological characteristics related to the operators. Regarding the psychological problems of labor in agricultural production, there is a report by Rigazinsky—Psychological Research on Agricultural Mechanization, in which he reported on his research on the occupational hearing of tractor drivers, and elaborated on the role of developing this ability in improving technical level. Regarding aviation psychology, there is a comprehensive report (Platonov). The reporter first made a historical review of the research on aviation psychology, and listed the role of psychology in aviation (such as helping with instrument design and arrangement, the selection and training of aviators, the arrangement of the work and life system of aviators, etc.), and finally introduced the problems related to space flight psychology.
    The vigorously developing communist production team movement will naturally not be ignored by psychologists. Comrade Yagonkova, the secretary of the Party branch of the Institute of Psychology of the Academy of Education, made a report on the formation of personality in communist production teams. Based on the materials of field research, she discussed the issue of the formation of the personality of young workers in production teams, such as the growth of consciousness, the improvement of cultivation in life, the transformation of labor motivation, the relationship between the collective and the individual, etc. At the same time, she also discussed how the combination of physical and mental labor in production teams can promote the development of technical talents.
    In terms of medical psychology, the issues involved are also very broad. General reports include: "The Role of Psychology in the Recovery and Diagnosis of Brain Function" (Luria), "The Role of Psychology in the Research, Treatment and Prevention of Neurosis" (Myasishchev, etc.), "The Role of Consciousness in the Compensatory Process" (Kogan), etc. Some other psychologists focus on studying the pathological phenomena of thinking. For example, Chagolinik reported on his research on the pathological phenomena of thinking in various mental patients. There are also many reports on the thinking characteristics of some mental patients. The pathological phenomena of other higher nerve processes are also the object of psychological research, especially the regulatory role of language in pathological conditions, the interrelationship between the two signal systems, and the compensatory role in movement, all have special reports. Regarding defectology, studies on children with mental retardation, intellectual disability, and defects in hearing and speech were reported.
    The general psychology and psychophysiology group often attracted a large audience, because the issues reported here are of common concern to psychologists. There are many reports in this area, such as the problem of spatial perception (Ananiev), the problem of visual central regulation (Bogoslovsky), the problem of the interaction of the two signal systems in time perception (Elkin), the problem of the formation of motor representation (Buni), and the problem of the reflex mechanism of memory (Busenikinov). Regarding the problem of language thinking, there are many experimental research reports. There is also a series of reports on the study of higher nerve activity types. These reports do not simply focus on the aspect of higher nerve activity, but strive to link psychological problems, discussing the relationship between the general type of higher nerve activity and temperament and personality (Milerian), the relationship between type and attention, and the individual differences in the flexibility of nerve activity in thinking activities, etc. There are also some special discussions on research methods. The Set Theory School also reported their recent research results at the conference. Some famous physiologists, such as Anokhin, Asratyan and Vazo, all made reports on physiological psychology at the conference.
    It is worth noting that Soviet psychologists have begun to connect with the latest scientific issues such as cybernetics, information theory, and electronic simulation instruments in the study of general psychology. For example, Sokolov reported on the perception process and its simulation methods. He pointed out that the development of modern "sensory machines" puts forward new requirements for the study of the perception process, and the perception process should be schematized and converted into formulas in order to design the required control procedures for the electronic computers that manage these "sensory machines." On the other hand, this research method can help us to more deeply understand the various components of the reflection process of perception. Zakharov compared the process of subjects solving problems in experiments with the solution path required to infer the problem according to the principles of information theory, in order to study some characteristics of human thinking activities. Some of the signal transmission problems discovered by Renkin in the study of the "language" of apes are related to the machine translation problem that everyone is keen to study today.
    In addition, the preschool child psychology group reported and discussed research on the development of generalization ability of preschool children, the characteristics of imagination, the age characteristics of hearing and kinesthesia, and orientation responses. Most of the reports of the comparative psychology group were about the study of apes. The history of psychology group also conducted a series of special issue reports. Finally, the plenary meeting heard reports on the issue of talent from older generation psychologists such as Leontiev, Myasishchev and Kostiuk.
    After the reports and discussions, the presidium made a summary report and elected the leadership of the Psychological Society. During the conference, a magnum opus reflecting the achievements of Soviet psychological science in the past 40 years—Soviet Psychological Science—Volume 1—was published.

    苏联心理学界在研究什么？
    徐联仓
    6月29日到7月4日，全苏心理学会在莫斯科举行第一届代表大会。大会报告并讨论了近年来心理学家的科学研究成果以及心理学界如何响应苏共的号召为实现宏伟的七年计划而努力等问题。参加这次大会的有正式代表一百七十三人，列席代表三百四十七人，还有应邀到会的外国心理学家二十八人。会上宣读的科学报告共有一百三十余篇，此外还有因时间关系不及报告而收入报告集的论文八十余篇，出版了报告集三册。斯米尔诺夫院士在全体大会上作了“苏共第二十一次代表大会决议精神与心理学的任务”的报告，全面论述了近年来苏联心理学家在科学研究工作和教学工作中的成绩，特别强调了心理学为实践服务的迫切性，指出配合党中央所提出的学制改革问题是心理学家的光荣任务，并且在有关劳动生产、医药卫生方面心理学家也不能袖手旁观。这种理论联系实践的精神也贯穿在大会的全部日程里。例如，有关中小学教育与教学心理的问题举行了八次报告和讨论，共提出四十五篇论文；有关劳动心理心理学举行了三次报告和讨论，共提出十五篇论文；医学心理方面举行了三次报告和讨论，共提出十六篇论文；缺陷学举行了二次报告和讨论，共提出九篇论文。以上有关实际问题的报告共八十五篇，约占全部报告65％以上。苏联心理学家在理论性问题方面也进行了许多有价值的研究。例如，普通心理及心理生理组举行了七次会议，提出论文三十六篇。在儿童心理、比较心理和心理学史等方面，也都举行了专门的报告和讨论。在中小学教育与教学心理的研究中，有些工作是直接与学生参加劳动生产这一课题有关的。这方面的报告有：参加农业生产劳动过程中学生个性的形成和变化（谢里凡诺夫、基联科等），在农业劳动中学生积极意志的发展（柯拉斯诺达而），高年级学生参加生产劳动动机的研究（纳吉莫夫），以及高年级学生参加生产劳动的兴趣的形成（道夫加罗），等等。在这些报告中，作者一般都抓住了一些关键性的问题作了研究，借以阐明学生参加劳动对其个性的发展有什么好处，为什么会有好处，怎样更有效地发挥这些有利条件，等等。例如，有的心理学家具体地研究了劳动组织的好坏对参加劳动的学生各种优良品质形成速度的影响，认为不是把学生放到生产中就解决了一切问题，而是还需要作妥善的安排和科学的研究。另外，参加生产要与正课学习密切结合，使生产活动不但不妨碍正课的学习，而且有利于更好地掌握正课学习的知识。有的心理学家发现在生产
  中所培养起来的注意力，在生产中看到了知识的实际意义和效果，对学生的正课学习都是有良好作用的。并且，他们认为，在生产中需要很高的纪律性、顽强的意志和创造性的思考，这些品质的获得也都对正课学习有利。因此，要有意识地在学生参加生产劳动时加强这些方面品质
  的培养。也有的心理学家把学生参加劳动中发现的一些问题提高到理论的高度。例如，他们研究了学生在参加农业劳动时所遇到的“外部困难”（如炎热、大雨和劳累等）与其主观上的反映、即“内部困难”（如各种矛盾情绪之间的冲突）之间的关系，如何解决这些问题，等等。
    另一部分工作是更具体地研究了生产教学的方法，以帮助学生更快更好地掌握生产知识和技能，这方面的报告有：在普通学校生产劳动教学中教导工作的心理学研究（古里扬诺夫等），高年级学生生产技能迁移的心理特点
  （米列良），高年级学生生产熟练形成中的个别差异（米斯秋克），劳动在掌握植物学知识中的作用（库德列采娃），等等。在这些报告中，报告人都根据实验材料，论述了有效的教学方法。此外，关于正课教学的问题以及关于教学与智力发展的问题等，也有许多研究报告。
    在教育心理学方面，大部分的报告论述了学生个性发展的问题，特别注意到了集体对其个性发展的影响，例如学生集体与学生个性发展的关系（施民尔曼），在寄宿学校中学生的个体特点的形成及其与集体的关系（热沃龙科），模效的心理学问题（鲁洛茨基），道德品质的发展（维金莫夫等）。
    劳动心理学方面有些是理论性的报告。例如，关于劳动活动与生产操作的问题（丘沙宁），报告人引用了实际工作的材料来阐明劳动心理的研究对生产可能起什么作用，同时分析了生产操作的特点以及工人的劳动活动与生产操作的关系，并进一步论述了生产的发展远景——自动化——与劳动心理学在其中的作用。关于工程心理学，列昂节夫等在“自动化机构的心理学研究中的动力学原则”的报告中，批判了现代资产阶级心理学家的“工程心理学”中“人与机器的统一系统”这一概念中的机械论的错误。关于劳动活动中意识的作用也有专门的报告，格列尔施坦在他的报告中讨论了劳动活动中有意识成分与无意识成分之间的辩证关系。他根据对“时间知觉”的研究，说明心理学家借助于特殊的训练方法，使一些不能意识到的感觉变得更为清楚（如对极短暂时间的知觉），从而促进某些技能的掌握。
    在直接联系生产劳动的研究方面，劳动心理学家把自己的力量放到当前最重要的题目上。例如，苏沃洛娃等研究了传送带生产中的产品质量以及完成操作的时间方面的心理学问题。生产过程控制方面的心理学研究（普希金），讨论了现在生产中的一个新问题——远程控制——中的心理学问题。报告人研究了某交通枢纽控制站的操作，论述了有关操纵员的各种职业心理特点。关于农业生产中的劳动心理学问题，有里加津斯基的报告——农业机械化的心理学研究，他报告了他对拖拉机手的职业听觉的研究情况，阐述了发展这种能力对提高技术水平的作用。关于航空心理学，有一篇综合性的报告（普拉东诺夫）。报告人首先对航空心理的研究作了历史的追述，并列举了心理学在航空事业中所起的作用（如有助于仪表设计及安排，航空员的选择及培训，航空员工作生活制度的安排等），最后介绍了有关宇宙飞行心理学的问题。
    蓬勃发展的共产主义生产队运动自然不会被心理学家所忽略。教育科学院心理研究所党支部书记亚贡柯瓦同志作了关于共产主义生产队中个性形成问题的报告。她根据实地研究的材料，论述了青年工人在生产队中个性形成的问题，例如自觉性的成长，生活方面修养的提高，劳动动机的转变，集体与个人的关系等。同时，她还论述了在生产队中体力劳动与智力劳动的结合如何促进技术才能的发展等问题。
    在医学心理学方面，所涉及的问题也是很广泛的。总括性的报告有：“心理学在大脑机能的恢复及其诊断中的作用”（鲁利亚），“心理学在神经症的研究、治疗及预防中的作用”（妙西谢夫等），“意识在代偿过程中的作用”（柯岗）等。另一些心理学家则偏重于研究思惟的病理现象。例如，查果利尼克报告了他对各种精神病患者的思惟病理现象进行的研究。也有不少报告是关于一些精神病患者的思惟特点的。其他高级神经过程的病理现象也是心理学研究的对象，特别是病理情况下语言的调节作用，两种信号系统的相互关系，以及运动方面的代偿作用，都有专门的报告。关于缺陷学方面，报告了有关智力落后，智力发育不全，以及在听觉、言语方面有缺陷的儿童的研究。
    普通心理学及心理生理学组经常吸引了大量的听众，因为这里报告的是心理学家共同关心的问题。这方面的报告很多，例如空间知觉问题（阿纳尼也夫），视觉中枢调节问题（波哥斯洛夫斯基），时间知觉中两种信号系统的相互作用问题（爱尔金），运动表象的形成问题（布尼），记忆的反射机制问题（布谢尼基科夫）。关于语言思惟问题，有许多篇实验研究报告。也有一系列的报告是关于高级神经活动类型的研究。这些报告不是单纯地从高级神经活动方面着眼，而是努力去联系心理学问题，讨论了高级神经活动一般类型与气质、个性的关系（米列良），类型与注意的关系，思惟活动中神经活动灵活性的个别差异等问题。对研究方法也有一些专门的探讨。定势论学派这次在会议上也报告了他们最近的研究成果。一些有名的生理学家，如安诺兴、阿斯拉羌和瓦祖罗等，都在会上作了有关生理心理学的报告。
    值得注意的是苏联心理学家在普通心理的研究中已开始联系像控制论、信息论和电子模拟仪器这样一些最新的科学问题。例如，索克洛夫报告了知觉过程及其模拟方法。他指出现代的“有感觉能力的机器”的发展向知觉过程的研究提出了新的要求，应当把知觉过程图式化变算为公式，以便为管理这些“有感觉的图机”的电子计算机设计其所需的控制程序。另一方面，这种研究方法可以帮助我们更深刻地了解知觉这一反映过程的各种成份。查哈洛夫把被试在试验中解决课题的过程与根据信息论原理计算推断这一课题所需要的解决途径作了对比，借以研究人的思惟活动的某些特点。任金在对猿猴的“言语”的研究中所发现的一些有关信号传递的问题，对今天大家所热心研究的机器翻译问题是有关系的。
    此外，学龄前儿童心理组报告和讨论了有关学龄前儿童的概括能力的发展，想像力的特点，听觉、运动觉的年龄特征，朝向反应等方面的研究。比较心理学组的大部分报告是关于猿猴的研究。心理学史组也进行了一系列的专门问题的报告。最后，全体会议听取了列昂节夫、妙西谢夫和克斯秋克等老一辈心理学家关于才能问题的报告。
    报告和讨论结束后，主席团作了总结报告，并选举了心理学会的领导机构。在会议期间，出版了反映苏联四十年来心理科学成就的巨著——苏维埃心理科学——第一卷。
