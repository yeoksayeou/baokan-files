Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 18th: The Chinese Academy of Sciences recently convened a metallurgy work conference in Shanghai to help newly established metallurgy science research institutes of various Academy of Sciences branches to clarify their research tasks and development directions, exchange experiences in establishing and running institutes, strengthen mutual cooperation and ties, and at the same time introduced the development overview and trends in the field of metallurgy science and technology at home and abroad.

Before liberation, there was only one industrial research institute in China’s metallurgy scientific research units, namely the predecessor of the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics (located in Shanghai), with a small number of people and simple equipment. After liberation until 1958, four metallurgy research institutes were successively newly established within the Chinese Academy of Sciences system. During the Great Leap Forward last year, many provinces and cities newly established seventeen metallurgy research institutes (or laboratories) in order to meet the needs of the development of the metallurgical industry. Some of them were established by branches of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and some were jointly established by branches and industrial departments or universities. Many institutes started from scratch, from nothing to something. In order to exchange experience in running institutes, the earlier established institutes respectively introduced at the meeting their own experience, or their experience of cooperating with other units, in building an institute from scratch, from small to large.

The meeting believes that the current main tasks of the newly established metallurgical scientific research institutions in various localities should be: according to the needs of local production development at that time and the existing human and equipment conditions, assist local metallurgical industrial production, research ironmaking, steelmaking, and the smelting of general non-ferrous metals; help local small blast furnaces improve production technology to produce qualified pig iron that is economical and reasonable to operate; help localities establish converter steelmaking technology, research and improve the smelting technology of various heavy non-ferrous metals, explore new smelting methods, and try to recover rare and dispersed elements from smoke, slag, and exhaust gas, and so on.

Helping the new institutes is the old institutes' inescapable responsibility. The meeting studied this issue and believes that there can be many ways to help, such as: old institutes training cadres for new institutes, providing technical data, information and drawings as much as possible; when conditions permit, old institutes can send people (or work groups) to relevant new institutes in their regions to conduct inspections and help brainstorm ideas, or send intermediate and senior researchers to new institutes for short-term lectures or to guide research work in a certain area; when old institutes are carrying out scientific research tasks related to a certain area, they should organize researchers from the local new institute to participate as much as possible.

The meeting also discussed the issue of cooperating with industrial departments and universities to train cadres, believing that the various institutes of the branches should focus on training cadres at present to lay a good foundation for future work.

    帮助新所明确研究任务
    科学院召开冶金工作会议
    新华社上海18日电　中国科学院最近在上海召开冶金工作会议，帮助各地科学院分院新建的冶金科学研究所明确研究任务和发展方向，交流建所和办所的经验，加强相互之间的协作和联系，同时介绍了国内外冶金科学技术领域的发展概况和动向。
    我国冶金科学研究单位在解放前只有一所工业研究所，即中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所的前身（设上海），人数很少，设备简陋。解放后到1958年，中国科学院系统内陆续新建了四个冶金研究所；去年大跃进中，许多省市为了适应冶金工业发展的要求又新建了十七个冶金研究所（室），其中有的是由中国科学院分院开办的，有的是分院与产业部门或高等学校合办的，很多所都是白手起家，从无到有。为了交流办所经验，成立较早的研究所分别在会上介绍了自己或与其他单位协作，从无到有、从小到大建所的经验。
    会议认为，各地方新建的冶金科学研究机构当前的主要任务应是：根据当地当时生产发展的需要以及现有的人力、设备条件，协助地方冶金工业生产，研究炼铁、炼钢和一般有色金属的冶炼；帮助地方小高炉改进生产技术，生产出合格的生铁和运转经济、合理；帮助地方建立转炉炼钢技术，研究改进各种重有色金属的冶炼技术探索新的冶炼方法，设法从烟尘、炉渣及废气中回收稀有、稀散元素，等等。
    帮助新建所工作是老所义不容辞的责任。会议研究了这方面的问题，认为帮助的方式可以是多方面的，如：老所为新所培养干部，尽可能地提供技术资料、情报和图纸；在条件许可的情况下，老所可以派人（或工作组）到本区有关新所去考察，帮助出主意，也可以派中、高级研究人员到新所短期讲学，或指导某方面研究工作；老所在进行与某地方有关的科学研究任务时，尽可能组织当地新所的研究人员参加。
    会议还讨论了与产业部门、高等学校合作培养干部的问题，认为目前分院各所应当着重培养干部，为以后开展工作打好基础。
