Actively Cultivate Propagandists

Since the spring of this year, the Party organizations of the people's communes in Xian County, Hebei Province, have selected and cultivated a group of propagandists with a certain level of understanding of policy from among the Party's propaganda teams. They are mainly responsible for publicizing the Party's policies, ensuring that the Party's policies meet the masses in a timely manner, and further strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses.

In this county, each production team selected a number of propaganda backbones who were active in their work and supported by the masses from the Party's propaganda teams. They regularly study and research the Party's policies, promptly convey the Party's policies and tasks to the masses, and reflect the opinions and demands of the masses to the Party organization, playing a role in inspiring the masses and connecting with the masses. When the Pusa Village Production Team of Xiaofan People's Commune first launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy, some commune members did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of saving grain. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the propagandists of this team, after widely publicizing the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, quickly unified everyone's thinking. In five days, the entire team collected 18,600 jin of wild vegetables, saving more than 4,000 jin of grain.

Because the propagandists can answer some questions raised by the masses in a timely manner and maintain close contact with the masses in production and life, commune members are willing to talk to them about things they do not understand. Liu Zhensheng, a propagandist in Ouzhuang, often has people come to his home to talk to him and reflect problems. Regarding the questions raised by commune members in terms of production, life, or Party policy, he provides detailed explanations for those that can be explained; for those that cannot be explained for the time being, he reports them to the Party branch in a timely manner.

The Party organizations at all levels in this county attach great importance to the training and education of propagandists. Nine communes, including Xiaofan, Nanheguan, and Dinan, have established a regular propagandist meeting system, generally holding a meeting every ten days. At the meeting, they impart propaganda content, exchange experiences in propaganda work, or answer some difficult questions brought by the propagandists from the masses.

    积极培养宣传员
    今年春天以来，河北献县各人民公社党组织在党的宣传队伍中，选拔、培养了一批有一定政策水平的宣传员，主要负责宣传党的政策，保证了党的政策及时和群众见面，进一步密切了党与群众的联系。
    这个县的每个生产队，都在党的宣传队伍中，选拔了一部分工作积极、受群众拥护的宣传员骨干，经常学习和研究党的政策，把党的政策、任务及时传达给群众；把群众的意见、要求反映给党组织，发挥了鼓舞群众和联系群众的作用。小范人民公社菩萨村生产队刚开展增产节约运动时，有些社员对节约粮食的意义认识不够。这个队的宣传员在党支部的领导下，经过广泛宣传增产节约的意义，很快统一了大家的思想认识，五天里全队共打野菜一万八千六百斤，节约粮食四千多斤。
    由于宣传员能及时回答群众提出的一些问题，在生产、生活中和群众保持密切联系，所以，社员有什么不明白的事都愿向他们说。欧庄宣传员刘振生，就常有群众到他家和他谈心事，反映问题。社员在生产、生活或党的政策方面提出的问题，有些能解释的，他就详细地进行解释；有些一时不能解释的，就及时向党支部报告。
    这个县的各级党组织很重视对宣传员的培养教育工作。小范、南河关、堤南等九个公社建立了定期的宣传员会议制度，一般是十天召开一次会议，会上传授宣传内容，交流宣传工作经验，或解答宣传员们从群众中带来的一些疑难问题。
