Resounding "Overture to the Eastward Advance"
    Tu An

    During the Second Literary and Art Performance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we saw several relatively excellent dramas. Among them, "Overture to the Eastward Advance," written by Gu Baozhang and Suo Yunping, directed by Shi Yan, and performed by the Frontline Drama Troupe, stands out.

    The historical background of this play is: As the War of Resistance Against Japan entered the stalemate phase, the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao called on the people of the whole country to adhere to resistance, unity, and progress, and to oppose surrender, division, and regression. The play depicts the historical events of 1940 when our New Fourth Army advanced into northern Jiangsu under this historical backdrop: The Vanguard Column of the New Fourth Army was conducting counter-raids against the Japanese invaders, but the Kuomintang's General Command of the Guerrilla Forces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong, stationed in Jiangzhou, colluded with the Jiangsu Provincial Government of the Kuomintang to annihilate our Vanguard Column in the Qiaotou area. For self-defense, the Vanguard Column occupied Qiaotou Town after capturing a Japanese stronghold. The Jiangsu-Anhui-Shandong forces, under the pretext of recovering Qiaotou Town by force, prepared to create friction. Following the instructions of the Party, the Vanguard Column sent representatives to Jiangzhou for negotiations before the outbreak of hostilities, and after the outbreak of hostilities, adhered to the principle of "We will not attack unless attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly counter-attack," giving the enemy a severe blow. Until the troops approached Jiangzhou, it again took the initiative to cease fire, emphasizing the importance of resisting Japan due to the presence of a major enemy, causing the Jiangsu-Anhui-Shandong forces to abandon their conspiracy of anti-communism and surrender.

    The most prominent feature of this play is its complex contradictions and sharp conflicts. The main thread of the contradiction in the play lies between our New Fourth Army and the Kuomintang's General Command of the Guerrilla Forces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong. However, the opposing camp is very complex: There are contradictions between the Kuomintang diehards (direct descendants of Chiang Kai-shek) and the Kuomintang guerrilla forces (i.e., the Jiangsu-Anhui-Shandong forces, regarded as miscellaneous troops by the diehards), contradictions between the traitors and the diehards, contradictions between the guerrillas and the traitors. They all scheme against each other, deceive each other, eliminate dissidents, expand their strength, either engage in infighting or exploit each other... And within the guerrilla forces, there are struggles between soldiers with national integrity and wavering surrender elements, and struggles by our underground Party members to win over friendly troops to revolt... All these contradictions revolve around the main thread of the contradiction. Behind this main thread is the main contradiction of that era, namely, the contradiction between the Chinese nation and the Japanese invaders. Although it is not the main contradiction in the play, it is the premise of all contradictions in the play. Faced with such a complex web of contradictions and conflicts, the playwrights conducted the work of refining and selecting the essence, organizing and arranging the dramatic conflicts so appropriately that all the plots revolved around the main thread of the contradiction, penetrating layer by layer, thereby demonstrating the open and aboveboard nature and righteousness of our Party and army's policy of unity against Japan.

    "Overture to the Eastward Advance" chose historical material full of dramatic potential. Instead of writing about the leaders of the enemy and us in separate scenes, it arranged for Chen Bingguang, director of the political department of the Vanguard Column of our New Fourth Army, to personally go to Jiangzhou to negotiate with senior officers of the Kuomintang's General Command of the Guerrilla Forces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong, using four scenes to portray the hero Chen Bingguang's face-to-face struggle with the opponent. This made it possible for the dramatic conflict to be expressed more sharply and more concentratedly. The scene of "Envoy to Jiangzhou" initially revealed the internal contradictions of the other side, describing the elegance and principled stance displayed by Chen Bingguang as a representative of the New Fourth Army while visiting Zhou Mingzhe, commander of the First Column of Jiangsu-Anhui-Shandong. The following scene, "Verbal Battle Against the Stubborn," was written with soaring spirit and vigor, with great pleasure. In this scene, Chen Bingguang appeared at the banquet of Liu Damazi, deputy commander of the Jiangsu-Anhui-Shandong Guerrilla Forces. This was an extremely dangerous occasion, but Chen Bingguang, despite not possessing real swords and guns, possessed the swords and guns of language, possessed the truth. He refuted one by one the anti-communist fallacies of the stubborn elements, the wavering elements, etc., revealed the true face of the traitor Wang Jingwei's representative, and promoted our Party's policy of unity against Japan, pointing out a bright future for the wavering elements. This scene was as thrilling as the "Hongmen Banquet" and as intense as the "Gathering of Heroes," showing the authors' gains from learning from tradition and their boldness and skill in positively portraying huge conflicts.

    Chen Bingguang's character is portrayed very vividly. As soon as he arrived in Jiangzhou, he first went to Zhou Mingzhe's house to unite and win over this soldier. Zhou said to him, "The weather in Jiangzhou is not good, don't you know that at all?" Chen Bingguang replied, "I don't care about the weather, what about the popular sentiment here? I would like to ask Commander Zhou for advice." As soon as he opened his mouth, he showed his optimistic spirit, his contempt for the dangerous environment, and his concern for unity. The author is good at pushing the characters to the most severe occasions of struggle to test them. The scene of "Verbal Battle Against the Stubborn" needs no further explanation: in a sense, this is more thrilling than Yang Zirong's clever entry into Tiger Mountain, because this is not disguise and wit, but an open political debate. Taking the scene of "Conspiracy and Frame-up" as an example, when Chen Bingguang discovered that the enemy had put poison in the tea in an attempt to harm him and his guards, he knew that he was in a dangerous situation, but he was not alarmed or discouraged at all, but immediately exposed the enemy's conspiracy. We see that Chen Bingguang has persuasion, criticism, and scolding for the enemies; sometimes he persuades earnestly, sometimes he speaks impassionedly, sometimes he speaks sharply; but, despite the variety of changes, he always takes the Party's policy as the criterion. Throughout the play, this character is not afraid of danger, is calm in the face of events, and shows the noble qualities of a senior military commander of the Communist Party.

    Another successful character image in the play is Zhou Mingzhe. This old soldier values ​​loyalty, friendship, and national self-esteem, and is unwilling to collude with his superiors. But because the old society has had too deep an influence on him, he does not have a clear understanding of the Communist Party. The author wrote about the multifaceted contradictions in his character, and wrote about the ideological struggle process that he finally revolted. Zhou Mingzhe was unwilling to fire a shot at the New Fourth Army on the anti-communist front, which aroused the suspicion of his superiors, and the stubborn elements conspired to engage in infighting, leaving him no way to go; his deputy commander Lin Yi (our underground Party member) and his sister Zhou Mingzhu (member of the National Salvation Vanguard Corps) also instigated him, which finally led him to embark on the road of rebellion. This type of character not only existed in ancient times, but also exists in modern times. If their image is artistically summarized and expressed in the work, as long as it is handled well, it can produce a very good educational effect, and it can often show the breadth of the work's summary of life.

    Among the negative characters, Liu Damazi is a relatively successful portrayal. This character is capricious and wants to make a fortune in the anti-communist war, but he ends up losing more than he gains. The author more accurately portrays the greedy, stupid, rude, and reckless character of this officer from a feudal warlord background. Liu Shiyi, the general commander of the Jiangsu-Anhui-Shandong Guerrilla Forces, only appeared in the last scene. Just as our troops approached Jiangzhou, and the enemy's deputy commander Liu Damazi was as helpless as an ant on a hot pot, Liu Shiyi suddenly appeared. This chapter is like a mountain turning back and a road disappearing, with willows dark and flowers bright, another village appears. Liu Shiyi's character is different from any other negative character. He has his own views and actions, but everything is based on preserving personal strength, so this character is completely believable.

    The director's handling has rhythm, ups and downs, and climaxes. "Verbal Battle Against the Stubborn" and "Friendly Troops Uprising" formed two major climaxes one after another. The director handled it with strong rhythm, rapid movements, and clean and neat execution.

    The shortcomings of the play are that the scenes depicting our army in Qiaotou Town are relatively flat, and the commander and chief of staff of the Vanguard Column lack dramatic action, so their characters are not prominent enough. The image of underground Party member Lin Yi is also not vivid enough, and his role has not been well emphasized.

    The actors are all neat and well-matched. The actors who played Chen Bingguang, Wang Yong, Zhou Mingzhe, Liu Damazi, and Duan Zemin all had better creations.

    响亮的“东进序曲”
    屠岸
    在中国人民解放军第二届文艺会演中，我们看到了几个比较优秀的话剧，顾宝璋、所云平作剧，石岩导演，前线话剧团演出的“东进序曲”，就是其中之一。
    这个戏的历史背景是：抗战进入了相持阶段，中共中央和毛主席号召全国人民坚持抗战、团结、进步，反对投降、分裂、倒退。剧本所描写的就是在这个时代背景下，1940年我新四军挺进苏北的斗争事迹：新四军挺进纵队正在对日寇进行反扫荡，国民党驻江州的苏鲁皖游击总指挥部却与国民党江苏省政府合谋聚歼我挺纵于桥头地区。挺纵为自卫起见，在攻克日寇据点后，进驻桥头镇。苏鲁皖部竟以武力收复桥头镇为名，准备制造磨擦，挺纵遵循党的指示，在战端未启之时，派代表赴江州谈判，在战端既启之后，又本着“人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人”的原则，给来敌以狠狠的打击；直到兵临江州，又以大敌当前，抗日为重，主动停战，使苏鲁皖部放弃了反共投降的阴谋。
    这个戏最大的特点是矛盾复杂，冲突尖锐。戏中矛盾的主线在于我新四军方面与国民党苏鲁皖游击总指挥部之间。但是对方阵营中却是十分复杂的：这里有国民党顽固派（蒋介石嫡系）和国民党游击队（即苏鲁皖部，被顽固派目为杂牌军）之间的矛盾，有汉奸与顽固派之间的矛盾，有游击队与汉奸之间的矛盾，他们各各勾心斗角，尔虞我诈，排除异己，扩充实力，或是互相火并，或是互相利用……而游击队内部又有具有民族气节的军人与动摇投降分子之间的斗争，又有我地下党员争取友军起义的斗争……这一切矛盾都环绕着矛盾的主线而展开。在这条主线背后，则是那个时代的主要矛盾，即中华民族与日本侵略者之间的矛盾。它虽然不是戏中的主要矛盾，却是戏中一切矛盾的前提。剧作者面对着如此头绪纷繁的矛盾冲突，进行了去粗存精的工作，把戏剧冲突组织和安排得那么妥贴，使一切情节都围绕着矛盾的主线而展开，层层深入，从而表现出我党我军团结抗日政策的光明磊落，大义凛然。
      “东进序曲”选择了富有戏剧性的历史素材，不是把敌我双方的领导人分场来写，而是安排了我新四军挺进纵队政治部主任陈秉光亲赴江州跟国民党苏鲁皖游击总指挥部的高级军官谈判的场面，用四场戏的篇幅来刻划英雄陈秉光同对方进行面对面的斗争，这样，就有可能使戏剧冲突被表现得更为尖锐和更为集中。“出使江州”一场，初步揭开了对方的内部矛盾，描写了陈秉光在苏鲁皖第一纵队司令周明哲家作客时所表现的作为新四军代表的雅量和原则立场；接下去的“舌战群顽”一场，写得腾骧磊落，酣畅淋漓。在这场戏中，陈秉光出现在苏鲁皖游击副总指挥刘大麻子家的宴会上。这是一个万分危险的场合，然而陈秉光尽管不拥有真刀真枪，却拥有舌剑唇枪，拥有真理，他一一驳倒了顽固派、动摇分子等四五人的反共谬论，揭露了汉奸汪精卫代表的真面目，宣传了我党的团结抗日政策，给动摇分子指出了光明的前途。这场戏惊险像“鸿门宴”，紧张如“群英会”，显示了作者向传统学习的收获以及正面表现巨大冲突的魄力和手腕。
    陈秉光的性格被刻划得很鲜明。他一到江州，先到周明哲家去团结争取这位军人，周对他说：“江州天气不好，难道你们一点不知道？”陈秉光回答：“天气我倒不关心，你们这里人气如何？愿向周司令请教。”一开口就显出了他的乐观精神，对危险环境的蔑视以及关心团结的态度。作者善于把人物推到斗争最严酷的场合去考验他，
  “舌战群顽”一场不用多讲了：在某种意义上说，这比杨子荣智闯威虎山更加惊险，因为这不是化装斗智，而是公开的政治辩论。以“阴谋陷害”一场为例，当陈秉光发现敌人在茶水里放了毒药企图暗害他和他的警卫员之后，他明知身临险境，却丝毫也不惊惶或沮丧，而是立即揭露敌人的阴谋。我们看到，陈秉光对敌人们有劝说，有批评，有痛骂；有时循循善诱，有时慷慨陈词，有时疾言厉色；但是，尽管变化多端，却总是以党的政策为准绳的。纵观全剧，这个人物临危不惧，遇事从容，表现了一个共产党的高级军事指挥员的高贵品质。
    戏中另一个成功的人物形象是周明哲。这个旧军人讲义气，重交情，有民族自尊心，不愿跟上司同流合污。但由于旧社会给他的影响太深，他对共产党又认识不清。作者写出了他的性格上的多方面的矛盾，写出了他终于起义的思想斗争过程。周明哲在反共前线不愿打新四军一枪，受到了上司的怀疑，顽固派又阴谋火并，使他无路可投；他的副司令林毅（我地下党员）和他的妹妹周明珠（民先队员）又在一旁策动，这才使他最后走上起义的道路。这一类人物，不仅古代有，现代也有。把他们的形象艺术地概括出来表现在作品中，只要处理得好，就能产生很好的教育作用，而且往往能够显示出作品概括生活的广度。
    反面人物中，刘大麻子是描写得比较成功的。这个人物反复无常，一心想在反共战争中捞一把，不想偷鸡不着蚀了一把米。作者比较准确地刻划了这个封建军阀出身的军官的贪婪愚蠢、粗鲁莽撞的性格。苏鲁皖游击总指挥刘世仪是在最后一场才出现的。正当我兵临江州，敌副总指挥刘大麻子像热锅上的蚂蚁那样走投无路的时候，刘世仪突然出现了。这种章法好比山回峰转疑无路，柳暗花明又一村。刘世仪这个人物不同于其他反面人物中的任何一个，他有他的主张和作为，但一切又都是从保存个人实力出发，因此这个人物是完全可信的。
    导演的处理，有节奏，有起伏，有高潮。“舌战群顽”和“友军起义”形成了先后两大高潮。导演处理得节奏强烈，动作迅速，干净利落。
    戏的缺点是表现我军在桥头镇的几场戏比较平，挺纵司令员和参谋长缺少戏剧行动，因而性格不够突出。地下党员林毅的形象也不够鲜明，他的作用也没有很好地被强调出来。
    演员都很齐整，搭配很好。演陈秉光、王勇、周明哲、刘大麻子、段泽民的几个演员，都有较好的创造。
