Xinhua News Agency, July 15th, Pittsburgh Dispatch: Five hundred thousand American steelworkers launched a nationwide strike this morning at midnight, thus beginning their long-awaited struggle to increase wages and improve working conditions.

    As the factory sirens sounded in the sultry midnight air, workers stopped working, left the workshops, and set up picket lines in front of the factories. It is reported that shortly after the strike began, 90% of American steel production had come to a standstill. Pittsburgh, Gary, and other American steel centers, where the glow of blast furnaces once shone all night long, were suddenly plunged into gloom and silence.

    This strike by American steelworkers is their sixth nationwide strike since the war. The steel industry is one of the basic industries of the United States, and the reduction in steel production caused by the steelworkers' strike is bound to have a chain reaction on a series of other industries (such as automobiles, coal mines, railway construction, etc.), thereby causing serious consequences for the entire industrial production and national economy of the United States.

    U.S. President Eisenhower had exerted pressure on the workers in many ways before the strike began, urging them to continue fruitless negotiations with the capitalists. The steelworkers ignored the intervention of the U.S. President and resolutely began their strike struggle.

    American steelworkers are meeting this struggle with high morale. Before the strike began, with the broad support of the public, they had already raised strike funds, food, and daily necessities, and have generally advocated persisting in the strike.

    "Steel Age" magazine, in predicting the prospects for this strike, said that the contradiction between capital and steelworkers is "fundamental and deep-rooted." The strike "may be long and fierce and will have a serious impact on the U.S. economy."

### 展开劳资斗争的一场重要战役  美国五十万钢铁工人大罢工

    展开劳资斗争的一场重要战役
    美国五十万钢铁工人大罢工
    新华社15日讯　匹兹堡消息：美国五十万钢铁工人今晨零时起举行全国大罢工，从而开始了他们期待已久的争取增加工资和改善劳动条件的斗争。
    当工厂的汽笛在午夜闷热的空气中鸣响的时候，工人们纷纷停止了工作，走出车间，并且在工厂门前布置起纠察线。据报道，在罢工开始后不久美国90％的钢铁生产已宣告停顿。昔日鼓风炉的火光彻夜辉映的匹兹堡、格利等美国钢铁中心，顿然陷于一片灰暗和死寂。
    美国钢铁工人这次罢工是他们在战后以来举行的全国性大罢工的第六次。钢铁工业是美国的基本工业之一，钢铁工人罢工所引起的钢铁生产减少势将对其他一系列工业（如汽车、煤矿、铁路建筑业等等）产生连锁反应，从而对美国整个工业生产和国民经济造成严重后果。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在罢工开始前曾多方对工人施加压力，要他们继续同资方进行毫无结果的谈判。钢铁工人不再理睬美国总统的干预，毅然开始了罢工斗争。
    美国钢铁工人正在以昂扬的斗志来迎接这一场斗争。在罢工开始以前，它们在社会公众的广泛支持下，已经预先募集了罢工基金、粮食和生活用品，并且纷纷主张坚持罢工。
    美国“钢铁时代”杂志在预测这次罢工前景时说，资方和钢铁工人之间的矛盾是“基本的和根深蒂固”的。罢工“可能是长期和激烈的，并将对美国经济产生严重影响”。
