Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 13th: The Rural Work Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a Shanghai Municipal Livestock, Poultry, and Aquatic Production Experience Exchange Conference in early July. The conference reviewed the development of livestock, poultry, and aquatic production in the ten suburban counties during the first half of the year, exchanged advanced experiences, and determined to continue vigorously promoting the breeding and disease prevention of livestock, poultry, and freshwater fish in the second half of the year, to develop subsidiary food production more, faster, better, and more economically.

In the first half of the year, the production of pigs, chickens, ducks, freshwater fish, sheep, rabbits, bees, etc., in the suburban counties of Shanghai all increased. Various production units have accumulated many advanced experiences in solving the problems of seedlings, feed, sheds, and feeding management. For example, the Tanqiao Production Team of the Jiangwan Commune in Baoshan County implemented the principle of self-breeding and self-raising, vigorously grasping the work of mating and pregnancy protection, and the number of pigs raised increased sharply, averaging twelve pigs per household. The Lianhe Production Team of the Silian Commune in Songjiang County achieved an average of one hundred poultry per household for both collectively raised and privately raised poultry. The Zhuqiao Commune in Nanhui County created "floating chicken coops" and mobile grazing of chicks, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient feed in the great development of poultry. These experiences were all introduced at the meeting.

Representatives from various counties, people's communes, and production teams seriously discussed the plans for developing livestock, poultry, and aquatic production in the second half of the year and next year, and implemented the measures one by one. The Zhuangxing Commune in Fengxian County, based on the current situation of boars and sows in the county, decided to strive to breed 14,000 pigs by the end of the year, nearly doubling the current number of live pigs. To ensure the realization of this plan, they decided that the management area would be led by a deputy director dedicated to subsidiary food production, and the production team and production group would also be led by a main person in charge of this work. Each management area will be equipped with one to two veterinarians to carry out four disease prevention campaigns each year. They also decided to allocate 2,400 mu of farmland and 1,200 mu of water surface to grow green fodder, and collect and process agricultural and sideline products as roughage. If the livestock sheds are not enough, the plan is to first use the old cowsheds, and then build enclosures in large quantities using local methods.

After discussion, the representatives attending the meeting were unprecedentedly confident in further developing livestock, poultry, and aquatic production, and expressed their determination to lead the masses in a great leap forward in the second half of the year to ensure the realization of the subsidiary food production plan.

Cao Diqiu and Wei Wenbo, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the meeting and spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that the ten suburban counties have made great achievements in subsidiary food production in the first half of the year. In order to adapt to the people's increasing purchasing power, greater efforts are still needed in the second half of the year to make a greater leap forward in subsidiary food production. Party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over subsidiary food production, fully mobilize the masses, and take advantage of the favorable conditions and current great opportunity for developing subsidiary food production in the city, grasp the work of developing subsidiary food production tightly, deeply, and meticulously, and ensure the realization of the production plan for the second half of the year.

    上海大抓家畜家禽淡水鱼生产
    郊区十一个县交流副食品生产的先进经验决定继续大干一场，把工作抓紧抓深抓细
    新华社上海13日电　中共上海市委农村工作委员会，7月上旬召开了上海市家畜、家禽、水产生产经验交流会议。检查上半年郊区十一个县发展家畜、家禽、水产生产的情况，交流了先进经验，确定下半年继续大抓家畜、家禽、淡水鱼的繁殖和防疫工作，更多更快更好更省地发展副食品生产。
    上半年，上海市郊区各县的猪、鸡、鸭、淡水鱼、羊、兔、蜜蜂等的产量，都有增长。各生产单位在解决种苗、饲料、棚舍和饲养管理问题上积累了不少先进经验。如宝山县江湾公社谈桥生产队贯彻自繁自养的方针，大抓配种保胎的工作，猪的饲养量猛增，平均每户养猪十二头。松江县四联公社联合生产队公养和私养的家禽平均每户达到一百只。南汇县祝桥公社创造“水上鸡舍”，流动放牧小鸡，克服了家禽大发展中饲料不足的困难。这些经验都在会上作了介绍。
    各县、人民公社、生产队的代表们，认真讨论了下半年和明年发展家畜、家禽、水产生产的规划，并将措施一一落实。奉贤县庄行公社根据全县现有的公、母猪情况，
  决定到年底力争繁殖到一万四千头，比现有生猪数量增加近一倍。为了确保这个计划实现，他们确定管理区由副主任专职领导副食品生产，生产队、生产小队也都由一个主要负责人领导这项工作。每个管理区都要配备一个到两个兽医，每年开展四次防疫运动。他们还确定划出二千四百亩田和一千二百亩水面种植青饲料，收集和加工农副产品作为粗饲料。畜棚不够，计划第一步将旧牛棚利用起来，第二步大量用土法建设圈棚。
    出席会议的代表们经过讨论，对于进一步发展家畜、家禽、水产生产的信心空前高涨，表示一定要带动群众，在下半年大干一场，保证实现副食品生产规划。
    中共上海市委书记处书记曹荻秋，魏文伯出席了这次会议，并在会上讲了话。他们指出：郊区十一个县上半年在副食品生产上取得了很大成绩，为适应人民日益提高的购买力，下半年仍需尽更大的努力，使副食品生产来一个更大的跃进。各级党委要加强对副食品生产的领导，充分发动群众，利用本市发展副食品生产的有利条件和目前的大好时机，把发展副食品生产的工作抓紧、抓深、抓细，保证实现下半年的生产计划。（附图片）
