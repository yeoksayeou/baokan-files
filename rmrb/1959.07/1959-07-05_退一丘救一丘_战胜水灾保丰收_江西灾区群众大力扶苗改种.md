Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 4th – The broad masses of people in disaster-stricken areas of Jiangxi Province, under the leadership of Party and government departments at all levels, are actively engaged in activities such as fostering seedlings, washing seedlings, transplanting seedlings, replanting seedlings, and changing crops, striving to make up for all losses.

Leading cadres of Party and government departments at all levels in flood-affected areas have personally gone to the front lines to command the battle, working day and night in the fields alongside commune members. In order to ensure a good harvest of crops, the broad masses of people in disaster-stricken areas have put forward the slogan "Retreat from one plot, save another, don't abandon a single plot of land, and don't let go of a single seedling," determined to overcome the flood disaster and ensure a good harvest. The 400,000-strong flood prevention army in the Gannan Administrative Region, after overcoming the flood, immediately投入了 (invested in/threw themselves into) a new battle of washing seedlings, fostering seedlings, transplanting seedlings, replanting seedlings, and changing crops. All members of the Yuejin People's Commune in Ganzhou City organized commune members to vigorously rescue crops as soon as the flood began to recede. Ningdu County organized 80% of the county's labor force, and in just five days, rescued all the crops in the county that had been flooded. Ningdu County organized a team of 150,000 people to vigorously rescue disaster-stricken crops, and washed more than 50,000 mu of seedlings in the county within four days. Shicheng County organized three specialized teams for grain, cotton, and coarse grains to carry out rescue work. More than 500 mu of early rice flooded in the Zhangtang Commune of Taihe County in the Ji'an Special District were all replanted with late rice after two days of intensive work.
