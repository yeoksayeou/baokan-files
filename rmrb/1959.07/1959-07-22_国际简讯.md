Argentine Government Issues Amnesty Decree
   Buenos Aires Dispatch: The Argentine Presidential Press Office recently announced a government decree deciding to "pardon" railway, petroleum, and transportation workers who were sentenced by military courts during the period of military mobilization.

    Beginning at the end of last year, the government successively issued military mobilization orders to 350,000 railway, petroleum, and transportation workers, using military law to try workers who participated in strikes. However, the working class responded to the government's reactionary measures with even more resolute struggle, finally forcing the government to issue the "amnesty" decree.
