    Solar Physics
    Chen Biao
    The sun is the mother of the Earth and the source of light and heat on Earth. The fusion of hydrogen nuclei inside the sun, equivalent to an engine with a power of 85.5 billion trillion kilowatts, emits energy in all directions. Two hundred and twenty billionths of this energy reaches the Earth and is absorbed, becoming the foundation for the life and growth of humans and all things. The activities on the sun's surface directly affect some geophysical phenomena. For example, the appearance of solar flares is closely related to disturbances in the Earth's atmospheric ionosphere, affecting the transmission of medium and short-wave radio; the large number of particles ejected simultaneously with the appearance of solar flares, after reaching the Earth's upper atmosphere, also causes a series of extraordinary geophysical phenomena such as abnormal auroras, abnormal disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field, and an increase in the solar branch of cosmic rays. Solar radio emissions also experience special enhancements at certain wavelengths simultaneously with or after the appearance of solar flares. In addition, the periodic changes in the number of sunspots (eleven-year cycle) and whether they are related to long-term weather changes on Earth is also an important question. The cause of these activities is one of the objects of work for solar physicists around the world for many years.
    The sun is also one of the billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Among these many stars of different ages and appearances, the sun is just an ordinary star of medium size and mass, having entered middle age. Its surface temperature is around 5,500 degrees Celsius, while some stars have surface temperatures as high as tens of thousands of degrees, and some have only two or three thousand degrees.
    The sun can be said to be a typical specimen in the stellar world. The advantage of studying it is that the sun is only one 270,000th of the distance from Earth to the nearest star; it appears to have a large enough area and strong light, making it possible to study the details of its surface using optical instruments with high resolution, which is impossible when studying other stars. However, the study of this single specimen cannot naturally serve as the basis for generalizing the physical state of all stars; the various aspects of countless stars are still extremely important research objects.
    Thoroughly understanding the internal and external physical states of the sun is very important for clarifying the sun-Earth relationship and explaining the position and evolution of the sun and the solar system in the entire universe. This field of knowledge is temporarily called solar physics.
  The Size, Mass, Internal and External Physical State of the Sun
    The sun can be divided into two parts: the main body and the outer atmosphere. Roughly speaking, the main body is the sun as it is usually seen, while the outer atmosphere is the extremely thin gas shell outside the main body, extending to a distance of several solar radii. This part is usually invisible, and can only be observed under special circumstances (such as a total solar eclipse) or with special instruments (such as a coronagraph) or using special radio waves (such as microwave - meter wave radio waves). The outer atmosphere is usually referred to collectively as the corona. There is a clear boundary between the main body and the corona, which is the edge of the solar disk we see with the naked eye.
    The size and mass of the sun that we are talking about now refer to the main body of the sun.
    The sun's diameter is 1,391,400 kilometers, 109 times longer than the Earth's diameter, and it is 149,530,000 kilometers away from the Earth (winter-summer average). Its mass is 1,986,600 billion billion kilograms, 332,488 times that of the Earth. The average density of the sun is 1.408 grams per cubic centimeter. The material at its center is denser, about 90 grams per cubic centimeter, while the surface is very thin, only one two-hundred-millionth of a gram per cubic centimeter. The density in the corona is even smaller, only about one hundred-billionth of a gram per cubic centimeter. The high density of the central material is due to the gravitational force between the materials, and the gaseous materials tend to gather towards the geometric center. Therefore, the center of the sun is under the greatest pressure and the temperature is extremely high, like a super high-temperature and high-pressure boiler. Its temperature is between 12 million and 13 million degrees Celsius. To maintain the temperature of this boiler and enable it to generate sufficient gas pressure to counteract the pressure generated by gravity, a huge amount of super fuel is needed to supply energy. This energy source is the process of four hydrogen nuclei undergoing thermonuclear reactions to fuse into helium nuclei. In fact, the path to achieving thermonuclear reactions on Earth was inspired by the study of the energy sources of the sun and stars.
    From the center of the sun outwards, the temperature gradually decreases, reaching only 5,500 degrees Celsius on the surface. There is no large-scale flow of material within three-quarters of the radius from the center, and most of the solar energy is generated in this region. Because thermonuclear reactions proceed faster in places with higher temperatures, more raw materials are consumed in the center, so the lack of large-scale flow inside causes inconsistencies in the chemical composition inside and outside the sun. The mass percentages of the chemical composition inside and outside can be obtained from calculations and observations as follows (all are recent results and have not yet been finalized):
        Element 　Hydrogen　Helium　Other
    Inside (center)　75%　24.25%　0.75%
    Outside (surface)　＞90%　＜10%　＜4%
    From three-quarters of the solar radius to the surface, there is a shell with large-scale flow called the convection zone. More than 50% of the thermonuclear energy generated inside the sun is transported to the surface by gas convection in this shell. The various activity phenomena on the sun's surface can be considered to be affected by this region.
    The sun we see is only a very thin part of its surface, with a depth of only a few hundred kilometers. However, the nature of the solar radiation we receive is ultimately determined by the physical conditions of this material, which is several hundred kilometers thick.
    The solar atmosphere, which we call the corona, accounts for only a very small part of the solar material in terms of mass. The reason why it is usually impossible to observe it by optical methods is because the visible light it emits is only one millionth or two of the brightness of the main body. However, the brightness of the sky background caused by the Earth's atmosphere scattering sunlight can reach about one thousandth of the brightness of the solar disk. Only during a total solar eclipse, when the sun's main body is blocked by the moon and the Earth's atmosphere no longer scatters sunlight, can the corona be clearly visible.
    The age of the sun is determined by its available fuel, and the amount of available fuel is difficult to determine, because helium is available after hydrogen is used up... However, our question is how long the sun can maintain its current state, because the current state is suitable for humans to grow and live on Earth. If we leave the current state, we will have to seek other living environments. According to calculations based on the current hydrogen content inside the sun and its stable state, we know that the sun has existed in its current state for billions of years, and this state can be maintained for tens to hundreds of billions of years. So we can live with peace of mind.
    Solar Radiation
    Solar radiation is the biggest factor in the sun's influence on the Earth. The commonly understood solar radiation is electromagnetic wave radiation (from X-rays - visible light - meter waves) and particle radiation (ejection of charged and uncharged particles).
    Solar radio radiation from wavelengths of 0.8 cm to more than 10 meters has become one of the objects of radio astronomy research in recent years. The wavelengths not mentioned above are not radiations that do not exist on the sun, one reason is that we have not yet invented receptors and light-transmitting materials that can receive them, and another reason is that the Earth's atmosphere has a strong absorption effect on them, preventing them from reaching the ground. Now that artificial satellites have become a reality, this difficulty can be basically overcome.
    Solar particle radiation is even more difficult to measure directly on the ground. Because the Earth's atmosphere not only weakens but also changes the nature of the particle flow, it is even more necessary to measure it on artificial satellites. The speed of solar particles ejected from the sun's surface must be as high as several thousand kilometers per second to reach the ground. The power to eject such a particle flow is very great.
    Studying solar radiation is our only source of information about the internal and external physical conditions of the sun. The process by which the energy generated inside the sun reaches the sun's surface is mainly determined by the nature of the radiation itself, the temperature, density, ionization state of gas atoms, and chemical composition of various parts of the sun. Therefore, from the known properties of surface radiation, we can have a general understanding of the above-mentioned internal and external characteristics of the sun. The various figures in the first section of this article are the results of research on solar radiation.
     Solar activity
    The above two sections talked about the average characteristics of the sun. In the daily life of the Earth, the sun appears in the same form every day. Except for the huge sunspots that appear very rarely on the solar disk, its surface seems to be calm and uneventful.
    But the reality is far from it. Imagine a gas ball with a surface at 5,500 degrees: boiling gas currents surge and collide with each other to form waves (solar granulation); sometimes raising large waves tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of kilometers high (prominences); sometimes in certain areas there are large explosions equivalent to many hydrogen bombs, spraying a large number of particles and strong light to the Earth, causing destruction of the normal state of the Earth's upper atmosphere's ionosphere, abnormal disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field, abnormal auroras, enhancements of the solar branch of cosmic rays, and sudden increases in certain solar radio and light wave radiation (flares and their symbiotic phenomena); sometimes some very strange radiation is produced in a very small area, not the usual but abnormal light waves, which disappear after only a few minutes (peculiar bursts). This change on the sun's surface shows that it is an exceptionally vigorous object.
    The most primitive phenomenon of solar surface activity is the appearance and disappearance of sunspots. The number of sunspots appearing varies from year to year. Humans have systematically observed sunspots for many years and have mastered their laws. The years with the most sunspots appearing on the solar disk were 1957-58, 1947, 1937, 1928, 1917, 1907, 1894, ... the interval is sometimes slightly less than eleven years, sometimes slightly more than ten years, sometimes thirteen years... the average is about eleven years, we call this interval the solar activity cycle. Whenever there are more years with sunspots appearing, there are more abnormal geophysical phenomena on Earth. And they all appear at or shortly after the moment when large sunspot groups pass the center of the sun's surface. In the 1920s and 1930s, people thought that large sunspot groups passing the center of the solar disk were the direct cause of the above-mentioned geophysical anomalies.
    We often see small areas of sudden brightness increase in areas with many sunspots. The brightness can increase to several to dozens of times the original brightness within a few minutes. We call this phenomenon a flare. Simultaneously with the appearance of large flares at the center of the solar disk, disturbances in the Earth's upper atmosphere's ionosphere begin immediately, and solar radio waves increase suddenly either immediately or slightly later. After 17-21 hours, abnormal disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field and abnormal aurora phenomena also occur. Therefore, flares are more closely related to geophysical anomalies than sunspots.
    We are currently unable to clearly predict when flares will appear, nor can we explain why the sun's X-ray, short-wave radiation, radio wave radiation, and particle radiation all increase with the appearance of flares, nor can we explain the specific relationship between prominences, the corona, and sunspot activity. Even the sunspots themselves, their eleven-year cycle, and magnetic twenty-two-year cycle have not been resolved. But it is already known that the main relationship between them is not a causal relationship but a symbiotic relationship. That is to say, there is a fundamental cause of solar activity that has not been completely clarified. The above-mentioned activity phenomena are just manifestations of this factor under different conditions.
    Solar workers from all over the world regard explaining solar surface activity as one of the important topics, not only because it is closely related to the Earth, but also because it supplies many phenomena that may be realized on Earth. Studying these phenomena will increase our understanding of various processes that are not yet known, thereby increasing the scope of human activities.
    Observational Basis of Solar Physics
    To obtain comprehensive solar radiation data as comprehensively as possible, the weather and observation instruments must be considered.
    Without the protection of the Earth's atmosphere, humans could not survive on the ground, but the Earth's atmosphere is the biggest enemy of comprehensive observation of celestial radiation. It absorbs a large and important part of celestial radiation, and also distorts the true appearance of celestial bodies, making it difficult for us to see the details clearly. The instruments we use also introduce a certain degree of distortion. Therefore, observers on Earth, in addition to striving to eliminate distortion phenomena in instrument manufacturing, must also choose an ideal observation location. From the perspective of optical observation, the requirements for this location are many sunny days, high terrain, low wind, and small temperature changes around the instrument during observation. For some special instruments, such as coronagraphs, they must also be installed in locations where the atmospheric scattered light intensity is less than 50 millionths of the solar disk light intensity. Therefore, not all locations can meet the requirements of optical observers.
    The requirements for instruments are large (collect as much light as possible) and precise (analyze as finely as possible).
    At present, the basic instruments that are indispensable for a solar optical observation station are a system composed of a large solar telescope and a large spectrograph. The effective light-receiving area of the solar telescope (the mirror area perpendicular to the direction of sunlight entering) should be no less than a circular surface with a diameter of 50 cm. The dispersion of the spectrograph requires 0.6→0.2 Angstroms per millimeter, and the resolving power of the spectrometer requires 400,000 to 600,000. The tool that achieves this resolving power and is most convenient for observers is a large grating with 600 lines per millimeter and a line area of 15×15 cm, used in the fifth to seventh orders of the spectrum. With such instruments, we can analyze in detail the solar spectrum, the spectrum of solar activity phenomena, and solar surface magnetic phenomena. On the other hand, using the interference principle of polarized light, we can make monochromatic light filters with extremely narrow transmission bandwidths to study the morphology of solar activity. This type of filter can be mounted on small telescopes to film solar surface activity.
    At present, there are not many instruments for observing the sun in our country. Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, this work has begun to make progress. But compared with foreign countries, especially the Soviet Union, it is far behind in terms of quantity and quality; compared with related physics disciplines in China, it is also not yet able to keep pace. But we believe that with the care and cooperation of all parties, the expected development will definitely be achieved.

    太阳物理
    陈彪
    太阳是地球的母体，是地球上光、热的泉源。太阳内部氢核的聚变，相当于一个功率为八百五十五亿亿瓩的发动机，将能量向四方发射，其中的二千二百亿分之一射到地球上来，被地球吸收了一部分，成为人类、万物生活、生长的基础。太阳表面的活动，直接影响着一些地球物理现象，例如，耀斑的出现密切联系着地球大气电离层的骚扰，影响了中、短波无线电的传递；和耀斑出现同时产生的大量粒子喷射，在到达地球上层大气后也会引起一系列的地球物理非常现象如极光的异常，地磁的异常骚扰，宇宙线太阳支量的增强等。太阳无线电辐射也在耀斑的出现的同时或以后，在某些波长有特殊的增强。除此以外太阳黑子数的周期性变化（十一年周期），会不会和地球上长期气象变化有关联，也是一个重要的问题。引起这些活动的原因是什么，就是多年来世界太阳物理工作者工作的对象之一。
    太阳又是银河系千千万万恒星中的一个。在这许多年龄不一，面貌不同的恒星中，太阳不过是一个中等大小、中等质量、已进入中年时期的普通恒星。它的表面温度在摄氏五千五百度左右，而有些恒星的表面温度则高达几万度，有些只有两、三千度。
    太阳可以说是恒星世界中一个典型的标本。研究它的有利的一面是太阳距地球仅为地球到最近一颗恒星的距离的二十七万分之一；它看来又有足够大的面积，很强的光，可以利用有高分辨本领的光学仪器来研究它表面的细节，这是研究其他恒星所做不到的。但是，这种单一标本的研究，自然不可能作为概括所有恒星物理状态的依据；如恒河沙数的恒星的各方面，仍然是极重要的研究对象。
    彻底了解太阳内部和外部的物理状态，对于明确日地关系，说明太阳和太阳系在整个宇宙中的地位和演化过程是很重要的。这一知识领域，暂时称为太阳物理。
  太阳的大小、质量、内部和外部的物理状态
    太阳可分成本体和外层蒙气两部分。粗略说来，本体就是通常所看到的太阳，而外层蒙气就是在本体外面极稀薄的气体壳，伸展到几个太阳本体半径之遥，这一部分通常是看不见的，只有在特殊的情况下（如日全蚀）或是用特殊的仪器（如日冕仪）或是利用特殊的电波（如微波——米波的无线电波）才能观测到。通常笼统地称外层蒙气为日冕。本体和日冕是有明确的界限的，这个界限就是我们用肉眼所看到的日面边缘。
    我们现在所要说的太阳的大小、质量都是指太阳本体而言的。
    太阳的直径为一百三十九万一千四百公里，比地球直径长一百零九倍，它离地球一亿四千九百五十三万公里（冬夏平均值）。它的质量是一百九十八万六千六百亿亿亿公斤，为地球的三十三万二千四百八十八倍。太阳的平均密度是每立方厘米一点四零八克。在它的中心物质要密些，每立方厘米约九十克左右，而在表面就很稀薄了，每立方厘米只有二亿分之一克。在日冕区密度更小，每立方厘米只有亿亿分之一克左右。中心物质密度大是因为物质间的万有引力作用，气体物质都有向几何中心集聚的趋势。所以太阳中心受压力最大，温度也极高，像一个超级高温高压锅炉一样。它的温度在一千二百万度到一千三百万度之间。要维持这一个锅炉的温度，使它能够产生足够的气压来和引力所产生的压力对抗，就需要极大量的超级燃料来供给能量。这个能源就是四个氢原子核进行热核反应聚变为氦核的过程。事实上地球上寻求实现热核反应的途径就是受了研究太阳和恒星的能源所启发而来的。
    由太阳中心向外，温度逐渐降低，到了表面，它只有摄氏五千五百度了。由中心到它半径四分之三的范围以内，它的物质是没有大规模流动的，而大部分太阳能正是在这个区域内产生的。因为热核反应在温度较高的地方进行较快，在中心原料消耗得就多，所以内部没有大规模流动，就造成太阳内部外部化学成份的不一致。由计算和观测可以得到内部和外部的化学成份的质量百分比如下（均为近时的结果，现在还未最后定案）：
        元素　氢　氦　其他
    内部（中心）　75％　24.25％　0.75％
    外部（表面）　＞90％　＜10％　＜4％
    由太阳半径四分之三处起到表面，是一个有大规模流动的壳层称为对流层。太阳内部产生的热核能在这个壳层内有50％以上是靠气体对流输送到表面上来的。太阳表面的各种活动现象可以认为是受了这个区域的影响的。
    我们所看到的太阳，仅仅是它表面很薄的一部分，深度只有数百公里。但我们所接受的太阳辐射的性质，就是由这数百公里厚的物质的物理状况所最后决定的。
    太阳外层蒙气，即我们称为日冕的区域，在质量上仅占太阳物质的极小部分。平常不可能用光学方法观测到它的原因是因为它发出的可见光和本体比起来，在亮度上只有本体的百万分之一或二，可是通常地球大气散射太阳光所引起的天空背景亮度最大能达日面亮度的千分之一左右。只有当日全蚀的时候，太阳本体被月亮遮住，地球大气不再散射太阳光时日冕才清楚可见。
    太阳的年龄是由它的可用的燃料决定的，而可用的燃料数量是难决定的，因为氢用完之后还有氦可用……。但是我们的问题却是太阳在目前的状态下能维持多久的问题，因为目前的状态是适合人在地球上生长、生活的状态。离开了目前的状态我们就要寻求其他的生存环境了。根据现在太阳内部的含氢量和它的稳定态结合起来所作的计算，我们知道，太阳已经在目前的状态下存在了数十亿年，而这种状态还能维持数十到一百亿年左右。所以我们完全可以放心地生活下去。
    太阳的辐射
    太阳的辐射是太阳对地球影响最大的因素。通常理解的太阳辐射是电磁波辐射（从X光——可见光——米波）和粒子辐射（带电和不带电质点的喷射）。
    从波长零点八厘米到十余米的太阳无线电辐射是近年来射电天文研究的对象之一。上面所没有提到的波长并不是太阳上没有的辐射，一个原因是我们尚未发明能够接收它们的受光器和透光材料，另一个原因是地球大气对它们起强烈的吸收作用，使它们不能到达地面。现在人造卫星已经成为事实，这方面的困难已可基本克服了。
    太阳粒子辐射是更不容易在地面上直接测量的。因为地球大气对于太阳粒子辐射所起的作用不仅是减弱而是改变粒子流的性质，所以更需要在人造卫星上测量了。太阳粒子由太阳表面喷出的速度要高达每秒数千公里才能到达地面。喷射这样的粒子流的动力是很大的。
    研究太阳辐射是我们得到关于太阳的内、外物理状态的唯一来源。太阳内部所产生的能量到达太阳表面所经历的过程主要是由辐射本身的性质，太阳各部分的温度、密度、气体原子的电离状态和化学成份所决定的。所以由已知的表面辐射性质，我们便可对上述太阳内、外的性状有概括的认识。本文第一节的各种数字就是对太阳辐射研究的结果。
     太阳的活动
    上两节所谈的是太阳的平均性状。在地球的日常生活中，太阳每天以同一形态出现在人们眼前。除了日面极少出现的巨大黑子之外，它的表面似乎是平静无事的。
    但事实却远非如此。设想一个表面处在五千五百度的气体球：沸腾的气流奔腾澎湃，相互冲激形成一个个浪头（日面米粒组织）；有时掀起数万到十万公里高的大浪（日珥）；有时在某些区域发生相当于许多颗氢弹的大爆炸，把大量粒子和强光喷送到地球上来，引起地球上电离层正常状态的破坏，地磁的异常骚扰，极光的异常，宇宙线太阳支量的增强和某些太阳无线电和光波辐射的骤增（耀斑和它的共生现象）；有时在很小的范围内产生一些非常奇异的辐射，不是通常的而是异常的光波，只维持数分钟就消失了（特异爆发）。太阳表面的这种变化，表明它是一个活力异常旺盛的物体。
    太阳表面活动最原始的现象是太阳黑子的出现和消失。黑子出现多寡年年不同。人类多年来系统观测黑子已经掌握了它的规律。日面黑子出现最多的年代是1957—58，1947，1937，1928，1917，1907，1894，……间隔有时是十一年弱，有时是十年强，有时是十三年……平均是十一年左右，我们称这个间隔为太阳活动周期。每当黑子出现得多的年代，地球上面的地球物理的异常现象就多些。而且都出现在有大黑子群经过太阳表面中心的时刻或不久以后。在本世纪二十，三十年代人们就以为大黑子群过日面中心就是上述地球物理异常现象的直接原因。
    我们常常在黑子多的区域看到小块亮度突增的地点，在几分钟之内亮度可以增加到原来的几倍到几十倍。这现象我们称为耀斑。和在日面中心大耀斑出现的同时，地球上层大气的电离层骚扰也立即开始，太阳无线电波有的是立即，有的是略迟也就突增。过了十七—二十一小时之后地磁异常骚扰和极光异常现象也发生了。所以耀斑是比黑子更紧密地和地球物理异常现象联系在一起的。
    我们目前尚不能明确预告何时有耀斑出现，也不能说明为什么太阳的X光，短波辐射、无线电波辐射和粒子辐射都随耀斑的出现而加强，也不能说明日珥、日冕和黑子活动的具体关系。甚至于黑子本身，它的十一年周期，磁性二十二年周期都未解决。但是已经知道，它们之间主要的不是因果关系而是共生关系。也就是说，有一个引起太阳活动的根本原因尚未彻底明了。上述的活动现象只是这一因素在不同的条件下的表现而已。
    世界各国的太阳工作者把解释太阳表面活动作为重要课题之一，不但因为它和地球有密切关系，还因为它供给了许多在地球上可能实现的现象。对这些现象的研究会增加我们对还不知悉的各种过程的了解，从而增加了人类活动的范围。
    太阳物理的观测基础
    要尽可能全面地得到太阳辐射资料，必须考虑的是观测天气和观测仪器。
    没有地球大气的保护，人类不可能生存在地面上，但是地球大气却是全面观测天体辐射的最大敌人。它吸收了很大而重要的一部分天体辐射，同时还歪曲了天体的真象，使我们不容易看清细节。我们所用的仪器本身也引入一定程度的歪曲。所以在地球上的观测者除了尽力争取在仪器制作上消除失真现象外，还要选择理想的观测地点。从光学观测的角度上说来，对这个地点的要求是晴天多，地势高，风力小，观测时仪器周围温度变化不大。对于一些特殊仪器，如日冕仪还要安放在大气散射光强小于日面光强的百万分之五十以下的地点。所以并不是一切地点都能满足光学观测者的要求的。
    仪器方面的要求是大（尽可能地收集光）、精（尽可能细致地分析）。
    目前一个太阳光学观测站所不可缺少的基本仪器是大型太阳望远镜和大型摄谱仪配合而成的系统，太阳望远镜的有效受光面积（垂直于阳光射入方向的镜面面积）应该不小于直径为五十厘米的圆面。摄谱仪的色散度要求每毫米0.6→0.2埃，而分光工具的分辨本领要求由四十万到六十万。达到这样的分辨本领又最便利于观测者的工具是每毫米刻线六百根，刻线面积为15×15厘米的大光栅，使用于五级到七级的光谱。利用这样的仪器，我们可以详细地分析太阳光谱，太阳活动现象的光谱和太阳表面磁现象。另一方面利用偏振光的干涉原理我们可以制作透过波带宽度极窄的单色光滤光器，来研究太阳活动的形态。这一类的滤光器配在小望远镜上，可以拍摄日面活动的电影。
    现在我国已有的观测太阳的仪器是不多的。解放以来，尤其是大跃进以来，在党的领导下这方面的工作已经开始有了进展。但是比起国外，尤其是苏联，在数量和质量上都差得很远；比起国内有关的物理学科也还不能并驾齐驱。但是我们相信，在各方关怀和协作之下，一定可以得到预期的发展。
