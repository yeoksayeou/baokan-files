Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 28th: Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa held a press conference today, reiterating the Cuban government's attitude towards the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Twenty-One American States.

Roa pointed out that the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Twenty-One American States, to be held in the Chilean capital in mid-August, should discuss fundamental issues such as the underdevelopment and political instability of Latin American countries. He said, "If these fundamental issues are not added to the agenda, Cuba will decide not to participate in the meeting."

Roa resolutely refuted the malicious claim that the tense situation in the Caribbean region was created single-handedly by Cuba. He said that Trujillo is the scourge of the Americas, "Since the Dominican Republic implemented dictatorial rule and pursued a policy of aggression and expansion, there has been turmoil in the Caribbean region... Cuba has never created unrest; we have always been under the threat of aggression." Roa exposed the Dominican Republic's plan to invade Cuba. He said, "The Dominican Republic is preparing an expeditionary force of 20,000 people, including foreigners. An invasion of Cuban territory from the Dominican Republic could occur at any time." However, Roa emphasized that any aggression against Cuba would inevitably be defeated, "because the Cuban people have stood up and they are united."

Regarding the Fourth Pan-American Conference to be held in Ecuador next February, Roa said that Cuba will propose the following agenda for discussion at this conference: First, methods to combat dictatorial regimes. Second, a judicial system that normalizes human rights. Third, revision of the interpretation of the right of asylum. Fourth, the economic measures proposed by Castro at the Twenty-One Nation Conference in Buenos Aires.

Xinhua News Agency, Bogota, July 28th: Colombian famous commentator Caliban published an article in "El Tiempo" today, praising Cuba's land reform. He said, "Cuba's land reform is just and necessary."

Caliban criticized the United States' practice of protecting dictatorial regimes. He pointed out that although the United States says verbally "we will not protect dictatorial regimes," it is estimated that it will take measures at the Santiago Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Twenty-One American States to avoid disrupting the "order" in the Caribbean region.

Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: Public opinion in Colombia and Argentina supports the struggle of the Cuban people.

The Third National Student Congress of Colombia held in Barranquilla on the 25th passed a proposal stating that they fully agree with and support Cuba's democratic reforms.

In Buenos Aires, the Argentine University Federation recently gave a note to the Cuban Ambassador to Argentina, expressing support for the Cuban Revolution and the Cuban people's struggle for freedom.

    古巴外长驳斥别有用心的诽谤
    古巴一直遭受侵略威胁
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚今天举行记者招待会，重申古巴政府对美洲二十一国外长会议的态度。
    罗亚指出，8月中旬将在智利首都召开的美洲二十一国外长会议，应该讨论像拉丁美洲各国不发达和政治不稳定这样一些基本问题。他说：“假如日程上不加上这些基本问题，古巴将决定不参加会议。”
    罗亚坚决驳斥了所谓加勒比地区的紧张局势是由古巴一手制造的这种别有用心的说法。他说，特鲁希略是美洲的祸害，“自从多米尼加实行独裁统治，奉行侵略和扩张的政策以来，加勒比地区就出现了动荡不安的局势……古巴从来没有制造过不安，我们一直受着侵略的威胁。”罗亚揭露了多米尼加准备入侵古巴的计划。他说：“多米尼加共和国正在准备一支由二万人，包括外国人组成的远征军。任何时候都可能发生来自多米尼加共和国的对古巴领土的侵略。”但是，罗亚强调指出，对古巴的任何侵略必然要遭到失败，“因为古巴人民已经站了起来，他们是团结一致的。”
    罗亚在谈到将于明年2月在厄瓜多尔召开的第四届泛美会议时说，古巴将在这个会议上提出讨论的议程是：一，与独裁政权斗争的办法。二，使人权正常化的司法体系。三，修改对避难权的解释。四，卡斯特罗在布宜诺斯艾利斯二十一国会议上提出的经济方面的措施。
    新华社波哥大28日电　哥伦比亚著名评论家卡利班今天在“时代报”上发表文章，赞扬古巴的土地改革。他说，“古巴的土地改革是正义的和必需的”。
    卡利班抨击美国保护独裁政权的作法。他指出，尽管美国在口头上说“我们将不保护独裁政权”，但是估计它将在圣地亚哥二十一国外长会议上采取措施，以便不打乱加勒比海地区的“秩序”。
    新华社29日讯　哥伦比亚和阿根廷的公众舆论声援古巴人民的斗争。
    在巴兰基雅城召开的哥伦比亚第三届全国学生代表大会25日通过一项提案，表示他们完全赞同和支持古巴的民主改革。
    在布宜诺斯艾利斯，阿根廷大学联合会最近给古巴驻阿根廷大使一个照会，表示支持古巴革命和古巴人民争取自由的斗争。
