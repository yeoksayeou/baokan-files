    Guizhou flue-cured tobacco area busy with weeding and topdressing
    Anhui begins harvesting spring tobacco, late tobacco is already over a foot tall
    (Our report) The more than 700,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco transplanted in Guizhou Province this spring is currently growing vigorously and uniformly in most areas. Key tobacco-producing areas such as Guiding and Zunyi, where planting started earlier, have begun baking the bottom leaves. The vast number of tobacco farmers are now actively weeding and topdressing, strengthening field management.
    Tight grasp and early action are the main characteristics of Guizhou's tobacco production this year. As early as the end of December last year, communes in tobacco-producing areas universally organized professional teams and groups, trained a large number of technicians, and began plowing and sowing. Transplantation began in late March this year, more than half a month earlier than last year. Early tobacco acreage accounted for 40% of the total flue-cured tobacco acreage in the province, which laid a good foundation for this year's flue-cured tobacco production.
    In tobacco planting, various technical measures were conscientiously implemented in various places. Tobacco fields were generally ploughed to a depth of six to seven inches, and more than one foot in high-yield areas. Base fertilizer was generally applied at about 2,000 jin per mu, and some tobacco areas also applied oil cake and chemical fertilizers. This year, excellent varieties such as "No. 400," "Foguang Tobacco," and "Xiaohuang Tobacco" were generally selected and disinfected by soaking in copper sulfate before sowing. Localities also widely used local pesticides to prevent and control the harm of mole crickets and green worms.
    This year, Guizhou has experienced more natural disasters, with more rain followed by drought, which is very unfavorable for tobacco growth. Tobacco farmers in various places, under the leadership of the Party committee, actively launched a struggle to save the disaster and protect seedlings. A few days ago, Zhijin County suffered a flood that had not been seen in decades, flooding part of the tobacco nursery and damaging more than 1,500 mu of tobacco fields. As soon as the flood passed, the vast number of tobacco farmers immediately rescued them, replenishing where needed and weeding where waterlogging was present, quickly salvaging the flooded nurseries and replanting 1,100 mu of tobacco seedlings.
    (Xinhua News Agency) Among the 220,000 mu of spring tobacco planted early in Anhui Province, the better ones have grown to more than three feet tall, and tobacco farmers in various places have generally begun harvesting and baking. The late wheat stubble tobacco is also over a foot tall, with about ten leaves per plant. Now, tobacco farmers in these areas are strengthening tobacco field management.
    There has been great development in flue-cured tobacco production in Anhui Province this year. According to statistics on July 11, the area of ​​tobacco fields planted in the province has reached 563,000 mu, exceeding the original plan by more than 60,000 mu. These tobacco fields were bred early, planted early, and are growing well. The 160,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco in Dingyuan County are generally more than three feet tall due to strengthened seedling raising and field management.
    In order to not delay the work of baking tobacco leaves and ensure that the sliced ​​tobacco is returned to the warehouse, the Provincial Department of Finance and Trade strongly supported key tobacco-producing areas in the supply of fertilizers, timber, and coal. The counties in Bengbu Prefecture are also actively trying to improve the kang rooms. Fengyang County has currently organized 795 tobacco kang construction teams to specifically build and repair kang rooms, and more than 800 seats have been repaired. (Attached picture)

    贵州烤烟产区薅草追肥忙
    安徽开始采摘春烟，晚烟已有一尺多高
    本报讯　贵州省今春移栽的七十多万亩烤烟，目前绝大部分生长得茁壮整齐。贵定和遵义等栽种较早的重点产烟区，已开始烘烤脚叶。广大烟农现正积极薅草和追肥，加强田间管理工作。
    抓得紧和动手早，是贵州今年烤烟生产的主要特点。早在去年12月底，产烟地区的公社，就普遍组织专业队、专业组，大量训练技术人员，开始翻土和播种。今年3月下旬就开始移栽，比去年整整提前半个多月。全省早烟面积占烤烟总面积的40％，这为今年烤烟生产打下了良好基础。
    在烤烟种植上，各地认真地贯彻执行了各项技术措施。烟地深耕一般达到六、七寸，丰产地在一尺以上，每亩施底肥一般两千斤左右，部分烟区还加施了油枯和化学肥料。今年普遍选用了“四百号”、
  “佛光烟”及“小黄烟”等优良品种，在播种前经过硫酸铜等浸泡消毒。各地还广泛使用了土农药，防治土蚕、青虫的危害。
    今年贵州自然灾害较多，先多雨后干旱，对烤烟生长非常不利。各地烟农在党委的领导下，积极展开救灾保苗的斗争。前些天，织金县遭到几十年未有的水灾，烟苗圃被淹一部分，烟地被冲坏一千五百多亩。洪水一过，广大烟农马上抢救，该补的补，该薅淋的薅淋，迅速挽救了被淹的苗圃，补栽了一千一百亩烟苗。
    据新华社讯　安徽省二十二万亩早栽的春烟中，较好的已经长得三尺多高，各地烟农普遍开始采摘烘烤。麦茬晚烟也已有一尺多高，每棵有叶十片左右。现在，这些地区的烟农正在加强烟田管理。
    安徽省今年烤烟生产有很大发展。据7月11日统计，全省栽植的烟田面积已达五十六万三千亩，超过原计划六万多亩。这些烟田育苗早，栽植早，生长良好。定远县十六万亩烤烟，由于加强了育苗和田间管理，烟棵一般都有三尺多高。
    为了不误烘烤烟叶工作，做到片烟归仓，省财贸部在肥料、木材、煤炭等供应方面，有力地支援了重点产烟区。蚌埠专区各县也正积极设法改进炕房。凤阳县目前已组织了七百九十五个烟炕基建队专门新建和修补炕房，现已修好八百多座。（附图片）
