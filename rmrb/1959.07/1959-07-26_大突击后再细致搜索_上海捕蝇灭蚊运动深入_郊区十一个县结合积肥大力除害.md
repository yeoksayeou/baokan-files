After the Big Assault, a Detailed Search
Shanghai's Fly and Mosquito Eradication Movement Deepens
Eleven Suburban Counties Combine Manure Collection with Vigorous Pest Control

(By our correspondent) From July, Shanghai launched a vigorous and down-to-earth sanitary campaign to eliminate mosquitoes and flies and vigorously collect manure.

The movement is massive. Workers, shop assistants, students, government cadres, and neighborhood residents have organized teams to catch flies, kill mosquitoes, and clean sewers, encircling and suppressing mosquitoes and flies everywhere, eliminating breeding grounds, and vigorously collecting manure. On July 5 alone, more than 857,000 people participated. On July 9, districts mobilized large numbers of people to conduct in-depth searches and eliminate mosquito and fly breeding grounds.

Sunday, July 5, people from all districts and all walks of life gave up their rest and worked hard, achieving brilliant results, eliminating large numbers of mosquitoes and flies and their larvae, and accumulating more than 18,000 dan of manure. On this day, some responsible persons of Shanghai's urban districts personally went to the front line to fight alongside the masses.

This year's summer sanitation campaign in Shanghai is more in-depth and detailed than last year's. After the citywide mosquito and fly eradication campaign on the 5th, districts immediately organized the masses to check the treatment of mosquito and fly breeding grounds and searched everywhere for omissions. The Tilanqiao District trained a mass team of more than 600 people to specifically check and search for mosquito and fly breeding grounds, processing while checking. Residents of Mengzi Road in Luwan District tracked and traced a mosquito and fly breeding nest and dealt with it in a timely manner.

After several days of inspection and search, on the 9th, the masses in each district launched another large-scale activity, launching an offensive against the newly discovered mosquito and fly breeding grounds. The Zhabei District mobilized 30,000 people to excavate sewers and garbage bins. The Qingyun Road office filled in more than 70 small puddles. Residents of some districts used smoke and other methods to eliminate mosquitoes and flies in public places such as parks late at night or at four o'clock in the morning. Many districts' residents also moved all their indoor furniture, cleaned and eliminated bedbugs and other pests, and prevented mosquitoes and flies from taking refuge indoors.

During the campaign, districts organized forces to carry out concentrated efforts on key areas and industries where mosquitoes and flies easily breed. The Penglai District organized a special team to help the pickled vegetable and sauce garden industries eliminate mosquito and fly breeding grounds. More than 14,000 people and more than 3,000 government cadres in Huangpu District excavated and washed all small sewers in one day on the 5th, and washed all large sewers on the 9th, accumulating more than 27 tons of fertilizer.

Following the large-scale pest elimination campaign in the urban area, the eleven suburban counties also launched a sanitary campaign to eliminate pests and diseases and vigorously collect manure.

In order to unremittingly and gradually deepen the struggle against the "seven pests," in addition to paying attention to cleaning, the people of Shanghai will launch a campaign in late July to continue eliminating mosquitoes and flies, vigorously improve environmental sanitation, and rectify the city's appearance; in mid-August, they will carry out a focused activity of further eliminating mosquitoes and flies and comprehensively eliminating pests; and in early September, they will vigorously improve environmental sanitation and rectify the city's appearance.

    大突击后再细致搜索
    上海捕蝇灭蚊运动深入
    郊区十一个县结合积肥大力除害
    本报讯　从7月开始，上海市掀起了一个轰轰烈烈、踏踏实实的消灭蚊蝇、大搞积肥的卫生运动。
    这个运动声势浩大。工人、店员、学生、机关干部、里弄居民都组织了捕蝇、灭蚊、清洗阴沟等队伍，到处围剿蚊蝇、消灭蚊蝇孳生地，大搞积肥。仅7月5日一天，就出动了八十五万七千多人次。7月9日，各区又出动了大批人员深入地搜索和消灭蚊蝇孳生地。
    5日是星期天，各区各阶层人民放弃了休息，挥汗奋战，取得了辉煌战果，除消灭大量蚊蝇及其幼虫以外，积肥一万八千多担。这一天，上海市市区的一些负责人都亲临前线，与群众一起战斗。
    上海市今年的夏季卫生运动，比去年的更加深入、细致。5日全市举行消灭蚊蝇大突击以后，各区随即组织群众检查蚊蝇孳生地的处理情况，并到处搜索有无遗漏。提篮桥区训练了一支拥有六百多人的群众队伍，专门检查搜索蚊蝇孳生地，边检查边处理。卢湾区蒙自路居民跟踪追迹，终于找到并及时处理了一个孳长蚊蝇的老窝。
    经过数日的检查搜索，在9日各区群众又展开了一次大规模的活动，向新发现的蚊蝇孳生地发动攻势，闸北区出动了三万人，掏挖阴沟和垃圾箱。青云路办事处填平了七十多个小洼地。有些区的居民深夜或清晨四时即在公园等公共场所以烟熏等办法扑灭蚊蝇。不少区群众并把室内家俱大搬家，打扫干净消灭臭虫等害虫，同时防止蚊蝇到室内避难。
    在运动中，各区对一些蚊蝇容易孳生的重点地区、行业，都组织了力量进行突击。蓬莱区组织了专门队伍，帮助咸菜、酱园等行业突击消灭蚊蝇孳生地。黄浦区一万四千多群众和三千多机关干部，在5日一天内挖掘冲洗了全部小阴沟，9日又冲洗了全部大阴沟。共积肥二十七吨多。
    继市区展开大规模的除害突击运动之后，郊区十一个县也掀起了一个除害灭病、大搞积肥的卫生突击运动。
    为了坚持不懈、逐步深入地与七害作斗争，上海市人民除经常注意打扫之外，7月下旬，将开展继续消灭蚊蝇、大搞环境卫生、整顿市容的突击运动；8月中旬，将开展以进一步消灭蚊蝇为重点、全面除害的突击活动；9月上旬，将大搞环境卫生、整顿市容。
