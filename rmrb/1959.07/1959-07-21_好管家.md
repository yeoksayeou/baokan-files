"Good Housekeeper"
By our reporters Ye Shitao and Zhou Shenglin

The bus drove out of the bustling city and stopped near a newly opened park. This is the famous workers' residential area in Shanghai - Kongjiang New Village. At a glance, the red tiles of the buildings are shaded by green trees, appearing so quiet and comfortable.

We had long heard that the residents here not only have a beautiful environment but also a "good housekeeper" - Kongjiang Store. We came here to visit these "housekeepers" by reputation.

The store is located in Kongjiang New Village and has also established branches or supply points in the nearby Fengcheng, Fengnan, and other new villages. They take care of the big "household" of nearly 90,000 people, carefully considering everything from arranging the oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar for each household to clothing, haircuts, and bathing. We visited the new village for a day and saw and heard many moving stories, which is how the title "Good Housekeeper" came about.

　　Think from Their Perspective

Everyone has to buy things. Salespersons and service personnel are no exception. When they step into another store in their spare time, they also become customers.

One holiday, Zhuang Yuhua and Huang Baomei, the canteen staff of Kongjiang Store, went to the city to play. When they passed a department store on Nanjing Road, they were attracted by several green plastic combs in the glass window. "Let's buy one back!" The two happily walked into the store.

The salesperson casually took one from the shelf. Zhuang Yuhua and Huang Baomei looked left and right, but they didn't feel satisfied. They weren't as lovely green as the ones in the window. The two asked to take the ones in the window to choose from. The salesperson became a little impatient. She took one out and threw it on the counter, "It's all the same!" Seeing the salesperson's unhappy face, Zhuang Yuhua and Huang Baomei pouted and left the store.

They didn't buy anything, but they gained profound inspiration. They immediately thought of themselves: "If our service attitude is not good, customers will also feel unhappy."

From then on, the two treated customers more enthusiastically and thoughtfully. They proactively served tea and towels to customers, and introduced dishes that they liked according to their accents. Some customers didn't know how to order dishes well, so they helped them with the selection and made careful calculations for them. As a result, letters of thanks and praise poured in. Zhuang Yuhua received fifty letters in half a month.

We heard many stories like this about putting oneself in others' shoes to improve service attitude in Kongjiang Store. Many people were deeply moved by the attentive and considerate service they received in advanced units such as the State-owned No. 1 Department Store and Wuweizhai Restaurant, as well as on trams and buses. They came back to learn from these role models and became excellent salespersons.

　　Residents' Inconvenience is Their Own Inconvenience

Treating residents' inconvenience as their own - we gained such a deep impression after visiting the salespersons of Kongjiang Store. Many of the salespersons here live in the new village and are good neighbors and close friends with the residents. They can quickly understand what the residents need. If they have any difficulties in their own lives, they also immediately think of the surrounding residents. Many problems in supply work have been quickly resolved in this way.

These past few mornings, the long queues that used to be seen in the new village's vegetable market are not so common anymore.

Why? The store manager told us, "The supply of vegetables has not increased much, but the way they are supplied has been improved."

In the previous period, the salespersons saw long lines at the vegetable market. In chats with their neighbors, they heard them say that there were too few vegetable markets and too few stalls. The salespersons thought: Workers have to get up early to buy vegetables, which affects their sleep, and waiting for a long time even delays them from going to work. They told the store leaders about this situation. The store immediately held a resident symposium to listen to their opinions, increased the original seven vegetable markets to twelve, and hired sixty-one residents as temporary salespersons. As a result, residents praised, "It's much more convenient to buy vegetables now!"

　　"Do you still feel any inconvenience in the new village?" Store leaders often asked salespersons in the vicinity.

The salespersons raised a problem that residents universally wanted to solve - the repair and maintenance of clothing and utensils - from their own living experiences.

They said, "If a pot is broken, there is no place to fix it. We have to carry the broken pot to the city, which requires running many roads. Sometimes we can't find a pot repair shop and have to carry it back. There are so many residents here, do we have to ask them to run around like this?"

Not long after, Kongjiang Store opened many repair service stations to solve this difficulty for residents. Some salespersons who originally sold watches, clocks and wireless electrical appliances, also consulted with master craftsmen to learn repair techniques. They both sold and repaired, bringing a lot of convenience to customers.

　　Care for them Like Their Own Families

One day, an old lady came to the candy counter of Kongjiang Store in a hurry and asked, "Do you have fruit syrup?"

Salesperson Du Liping stepped forward, took the goods, and started chatting with the old lady. The old lady told her that her grandson was sick and had severe diarrhea, and wanted to drink some fruit syrup.

As soon as Du Liping heard it was diarrhea, she immediately retracted her hand. She considered that fruit syrup is cold, and it would be bad for the child to drink it when he was sick, so she explained the reason to the old lady and introduced a kind of milk porridge with good nutrition, which would taste sweet and delicious when mixed with boiling water, and the child would definitely like it. The old lady was reluctant to listen at first, fearing that her grandson would not want it when she bought it back. Du Liping insisted that she not buy fruit syrup, and patiently persuaded her again and again. Finally, the old lady bought a bag of milk porridge and went back.

The next day, the old lady came again. She said to Du Liping gratefully, "Thank you, the child was very happy to drink it." After saying that, she bought another bag.

The characteristic of the new village is that there are many working people and few idle people at home. The store salespersons saw that many women in the community were sick after giving birth, and they thought, if someone in their own family was sick or had a baby, how much they would need someone to take care of them! Now their families are working hard in the factory for the country, unable to come back to take care of them, we should care for them like their own families. The salespersons tried to find out how many women after giving birth and patients there were in the new village, visited them at their homes, and proactively delivered goods to their doors if they needed anything. In the past three months, the store has delivered nutritional food to the women after giving birth and patients in the new village more than 2,000 times, and often delivered various condiments to their homes. Residents praised, "The store is really thoughtful!"

Li Wenjuan, a female worker from Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 2, was resting at home after giving birth. The vegetable market salesperson delivered nutritional food to her home every other day. Li Wenjuan said gratefully, "In the past, when I gave birth, there was no one at home, and the child's father had to take time off to buy vegetables. Now the salesperson delivers eggs today, fish and meat the day after tomorrow, and I don't have to worry about it myself anymore."

　　Serving as "Advisers" to the Masses

The salespersons of Kongjiang Store not only sell things but also serve as "advisers" to the residents' lives. Many things that seem to be "extra" are always done proactively as long as the residents need them.

People always want to make their meals more delicious. The chefs of the store's canteen understand this feeling. They serve as voluntary teachers for the cooks of the residents' canteens, giving a lesson every Sunday, teaching the cooks how to make vegetarian chicken and vegetarian ham with bean curd sheets, how to make various flowering steamed buns, how to use one yellow croaker to make fish balls, fish fillets, smoked fish...

Not only that, but the chefs also help the residents' canteens save food, coal briquettes, and cooking oil, just like in their own canteen. Once, chef Chao Yueshou went to the second residents' canteen of Kongjiang No. 2 Building and found that their stove had a problem. Upon inspection, it turned out that the stove plug was loose, and the stove leaked coal when it was turned on. Chao Yueshou used his holiday time to help this residents' canteen repair the stove, saving five pounds of coal briquettes every day.

Residents often come to the salespersons to discuss any difficulties they encounter. In the previous period, many residents reported, "The pots break very easily?" The salespersons felt as uneasy as they did when they heard it. They collected detailed information on the residents' use of pots, analyzed and studied it, and finally found the reason. Later, when residents came to the store to buy pots, the salespersons told them:

"The bottom of the pot should not touch water, otherwise it will rust easily." "When the bottom of the pot is red-hot, don't immediately pour cold water on it. A sudden change from hot to cold will affect the life of the pot."...

Sure enough, fewer and fewer people came to the store to say "the pot is broken" afterward.

The salespersons of Kongjiang Store are like this, putting themselves in the residents' shoes, understanding their difficulties, and integrating with the residents, conscientiously managing this big "household." The words of model salesperson Xu Genqian express everyone's feelings:

"If the customers are not happy, I myself am distressed; when the customers are happy, I am as happy as they are."

### “好管家”

    “好管家”
    本报记者　叶世涛　周胜林
    公共汽车驶出热闹的市区不久，在一个新辟的公园附近停了下来。这里是上海有名的工人住宅区——控江新村。一眼望过去，绿树掩映着一幢幢楼房的红瓦，显得那么宁静、安逸。
    早就听说，住在这里的居民不仅有一个幽美的环境，而且有一个“好管家”——控江商店。我们就是慕名来访问这些“管家人”的。
    商店开在控江新村里，又在附近的凤城、凤南等新村设立了门市部或供应点。他们料理着这个将近九万人的大“家务”，从安排每户人家的油、盐、酱、醋，到穿衣、理发、洗澡，样样考虑周到。我们在新村访问了一天，看到和听到许多动人的事例，原来“好管家”这个称呼是这样得来的。
        设身处地想一想
    每个人都要买东西。营业员、服务员也不例外。当他们在工作之暇，跨进另一家商店的时候，也同样成了顾客。
    一个假日，控江商店的食堂服务员庄郁华和黄宝妹相伴到市区游玩，路过南京路的一家百货店时，被玻璃橱窗里几把绿色的塑料梳子吸引住了。“买一把回去吧！”两个人高高兴兴地走进了店堂。
    营业员随便从货架上拿下一把，庄郁华和黄宝妹左看右看，总觉得不称心，没有橱窗里的几把那样绿得可爱。两人要求把橱里的拿出来挑选。营业员有些不耐烦了。拿出一把往柜台上一抛，“还不是一样！”瞧着营业员不愉快的脸色，庄郁华和黄宝妹翘起嘴唇，离开了商店。
    东西没有买到，两人却得到了深刻的启发。她们马上联想到自己：“要是我们的服务态度不好，顾客心里也一定会这样不愉快。”
    从这以后，两人招待顾客更加热情周到。她们主动给顾客端茶、递毛巾，根据顾客的口音，介绍他们爱吃的菜点；有些顾客点菜不大会掌握，她们就帮助配菜，为顾客精打细算。于是，感谢信、表扬信纷至沓来，庄郁华在半个月中就接到了五十封。
    像这样将心比心，改善服务态度的事例，我们在控江商店听到很多。不少人在国营第一百货商店、五味斋饮食店这些先进单位和电车、公共汽车上，受到了殷勤体贴的招待，深受感动，回来学习这些榜样，成为优秀的营业员。
      居民不便就是自己不便
    把居民的不便看作自己的不便——我们访问了控江商店的营业员后，获得了这样一个深刻的印象。这里的许多营业员就住在新村，跟居民是好邻居，也是知心朋友。居民有什么需要，他们很快就能了解；自己生活中有什么困难，也马上想到周围的居民。许多供应工作中的问题，就这样迅速地得到了解决。
    这几天的早晨，新村菜场上，不大看到过去那种长龙一样的队伍了。
    为什么呢？商店经理告诉我们：“蔬菜的供应量并没有增加很多，而是供应的方式有了改进。”
    前一时期，营业员看到菜场上排队很长。同左邻右舍的闲谈中，听到他们反映说，菜场太少，摊头太少。营业员们想：工人起早买菜要影响睡眠，等久了甚至耽误上班。他们把这个情况告诉商店的领导人。商店就马上召开居民座谈会，听取他们的意见，把原来的七个菜场增加到十二个，又请了六十一个居民充当临时营业员；各个水果摊也代售蔬菜。这样一来，居民纷纷称赞说：买菜方便多了！
      “在新村里，还感到有什么不便吗？”商店领导人经常这样访问在附近的营业员。
    营业员从自己生活的感受中，提出了一个居民普遍要求解决的问题——衣物用具的修修配配。
    他们说：“锅子破了，没有地方补。我们拎着破锅到市区去，要跑很多路，有时找不到补锅的店摊还得拎回来。这里那么多居民，难道都叫他们这样去跑吗？”
    隔了不久，控江商店开办了许多修配服务站，解决居民这方面的困难。一些原来出售钟表、无线电器材的营业员，也请教老师傅，学习修理技术。他们既卖又修，给顾客带来了不少方便。
    像他们的家属一样关心
    一天，一位老太太匆匆忙忙来到控江商店的糖果柜前，问道：“有果子露吗？”
    营业员杜莉萍迎上前去，一面拿货，一面和老太太攀谈起来。老太太告诉她：小孙儿病了，肚子泻得厉害，想喝点果子露。
    杜莉萍一听是泻肚子，马上把手缩回来。她考虑到，果子露是冷的，孩子有病喝下去一定不好，就把道理讲给老太太听，同时介绍一种营养很好的牛奶羹，用开水一冲，味道甜津津的，孩子一定很喜欢。老太太起先不肯听，怕买回去孙儿不要。杜莉萍坚持叫她不要买果子露，并且耐心地再三劝说，最后老太太才买了一包牛奶羹回去。
    隔了一天，这位老太太又来了。她感激地对杜莉萍说：“谢谢你，孩子喝了很高兴。”说罢，又买了一包。
    新村的特点是做工的人多，家里闲人少。商店营业员看到居民中有不少产妇有病，就想，如果自己家里有人害病或生孩子，是多么需要有人来照应啊！现在他们的家属正在工厂里为国家紧张生产，不能回来照顾，我们应该像他们的家属一样去关心他们。营业员设法了解到新村有多少产妇和病人，到他们家中去访问，有什么需要，就主动送货上门。最近三个月来，商店已为新村的产妇和病人送了二千多次营养菜，还经常把各种调味品送到他们家中。居民纷纷夸赞：“商店想得真正周到！”
    上钢二厂有个女工李文娟，分娩以后在家休养，菜场营业员每隔一天把营养食品送到她家里。李文娟感激地说：“过去生孩子，家里没人，孩子的爸爸特地请了假去买菜。现在营业员今天送鸡蛋，后天送鱼、肉，再也用不到自己操心了。”
        给群众当“参谋”
    控江商店的营业员不单卖东西，而且当上了居民生活的“参谋”。许多看来是“分外”的事情，只要居民需要，他们总是主动去做。
    人们总想把饭菜做得可口一点。商店食堂的厨师理解这种心情，他们担任了居民食堂炊事员的义务教师，每个星期天上一课，教炊事员们怎样用百叶做素鸡、素火腿，怎样做各种开花馒头，怎样用一条黄鱼烧出鱼圆、鱼片、熏鱼……。
    不仅这些，厨师们还像在自己的食堂里一样帮助居民食堂节约粮食、煤球和食油。有一次，厨师巢岳寿到控江二材第二居民食堂去，发现他们的炉子有毛病。一检查，原来是炉塞松了，通一下炉子就漏煤。巢岳寿利用假日时间帮助这个居民食堂修好了炉子，每天可以节省五斤煤球。
    居民碰到什么困难，常常来找营业员商量。前一个时期，许多居民反映：“锅子很容易坏？”营业员听了，心里和他们一样的不安。他们详细地收集了居民用锅的情况，进行分析研究，终于找出了原因。以后，居民到商店买锅子的时候，营业员就告诉他们：
  “锅底不能碰到水，否则容易生锈。”“锅底烧红了，不要马上把冷水冲下去，突然的一冷一热就会影响锅子的寿命。”……
    果然，以后到商店来说“锅子破了”的人越来越少了。
    控江商店的营业员就是这样将心比心，体谅居民的困难，和居民打成一片，兢兢业业地操持这个大“家务”的。模范营业员须根千的话表达了大家的心情：
      “顾客不乐意，我自己也苦闷；顾客高兴了，我也同他们一样愉快。”
