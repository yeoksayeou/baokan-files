Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 12th: At a meeting of the Council of the Organization of American States on the 10th, a motion by Venezuela was passed to postpone discussion on the issue of convening a meeting of the foreign ministers of the twenty-one American countries to study the so-called tensions in the Caribbean Sea. The proposal to convene a meeting of foreign ministers was originally put forward by Haiti, and the above proposal was strongly supported by the U.S. government, with the aim of creating a pretext for interfering in the Cuban revolution.

At the Council meeting of the "Organization of American States" held on the 10th, the U.S. representative was in a very embarrassing and isolated position. The U.S.-backed proposal to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of the American states was resolutely opposed by Cuba, Venezuela, and Mexico, while most other countries abstained from voting.

Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa condemned, "American corporations affected by land reform are conspiring against Cuba and the Cuban revolution." He stated that Cuba's position is: as long as the meeting of the foreign ministers of the twenty-one countries is convened because of the unreasonable accusations made by the Dominican Republic against Cuba and Venezuela, Cuba will oppose it, whether it is formal or informal. He said: "Cuba will never participate in a meeting convened due to Trujillo's despicable machinations, and will never let that dictator gain any advantage."

The Venezuelan representative immediately proposed to postpone the discussion on convening a meeting of the foreign ministers of the twenty-one American countries. This motion was supported by eleven Latin American countries. Six countries abstained from voting, and only the United States, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti voted against it.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 12th: Cuban newspapers on the 11th, commenting on the situation of the Council meeting of the "Organization of American States" on the 10th, exposed the U.S. conspiracy to instigate the convening of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the twenty-one American countries, and talked about the U.S.'s predicament at the meeting. In order to create a pretext for armed intervention in Cuba, the United States incited the Dominican Republic to file unreasonable accusations against the "Organization of American States," alleging invasions from Cuba and Venezuela. Because this slander was criticized both inside and outside the meeting, at the meeting on the 10th, while the Dominican Republic withdrew its accusations, the United States insisted on convening a meeting of the foreign ministers of the twenty-one American countries to discuss the so-called tense situation in the Caribbean region, but the meeting decided by a majority vote to postpone the discussion of this proposal.

　　The "July 26th Movement" organ "Revolución" accused the United States of adopting a rude attitude at the meeting in order to achieve its goals. The newspaper said, "Yesterday's meeting was originally convened to discuss the Dominican Republic's accusations. The Dominican Republic's accusations were withdrawn, and there was no reason for the meeting to continue. Any new motion should be announced twenty-four hours in advance. However, the United States insisted on discussing and passing the motion to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of the American countries, thereby violating the regulations of the organization." The newspaper pointed out that the only countries following it were the United States' tyrannical puppets, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. This shows that "the degree of independence gained by Latin American countries" is enough to isolate the United States in its conspiracies.

　　"Noticias de Hoy" vehemently criticized the imperialist attitude of the United States. It believes that the US actions at the meeting were reminiscent of the ugly conspiracy of the past against Guatemala (the democratic regime). It said: "The United States wants to study the situation in the Caribbean because 'there is communist infiltration.' This is the same old tune, this is the perfect excuse to interfere with Latin American countries controlling their own destiny! But, the Guatemalan event will not work on us."

### 召开美洲外长会议的建议被搁置  美国干涉古巴的阴谋受挫

    召开美洲外长会议的建议被搁置
    美国干涉古巴的阴谋受挫
    据新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：  “美洲国家组织”理事会10日举行的会议上通过委内瑞拉的一项动议，决定延期讨论关于召开美洲二十一国外长会议来研究所谓加勒比海的紧张局势问题。召开外长会议的建议是早先由海地提出的，上述建议得到美国政府的大力支持，其目的是为干涉古巴革命制造借口。
    在10日举行的“美洲国家组织”理事会会议上，美国代表处于非常狼狈和孤立的地位。美国支持的关于召开美洲国家外长会议的建议遭到古巴、委内瑞拉和墨西哥的坚决反对，同时其他大多数国家在投票时弃权。
    古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚谴责说，“受到土地改革影响的美国大公司正在阴谋反对古巴和古巴革命。”他表示，古巴的立场是：只要二十一国外长会议是为了多米尼加对古巴和委内瑞拉提出的无理指责而召开，古巴就反对它，不管它是正式的还是非正式的。他说：“古巴决不参加由于特鲁希略从中卑鄙搞鬼而召开的会议，并且也决不会让那个独裁者捞到便宜。”
    委内瑞拉代表当即提议延期讨论关于召开美洲二十一国外长会议的问题。这个动议得到十一个拉丁美洲国家的支持。有六个国家投票弃权，只有美国、多米尼加和海地投票反对。
    据新华社哈瓦那12日电　古巴报纸11日在评论“美洲国家组织”理事会10日会议的情况时，揭露了美国策动召开美洲二十一国外长会议的阴谋，并且谈到美国在会上的窘境。为了制造武装干涉古巴的借口，美国曾唆使多米尼加向“美洲国家组织”提出所谓来自古巴和委内瑞拉的入侵的无理指控，由于这种诬告遭到会内会外的抨击，在10日的会议上，在多米尼加撤回它的指控的同时，美国坚持要召开美洲二十一国外长会议来讨论所谓加勒比海地区的紧张局势问题，但是会议以多数票决定延期讨论这项建议。
      “7月26日运动”机关报“革命报”指责美国为了达到它的目的在会上采取蛮横的态度。这家报纸说，“昨天的会议本来是为讨论多米尼加的控告而召开的。多米尼加的控告撤回去了，会议就没有理由再继续下去。任何新的动议都应该在二十四小时之前宣布。但是，美国却坚持要讨论和通过召开美洲国家外长会议的动议，从而违背了这个组织的规定。”报纸指出，追随它的只有美国暴虐的傀儡多米尼加和海地。这表明“拉丁美洲国家所获得的独立的程度”足以使美国在它的阴谋活动中陷于孤立。
      “国民日报”猛烈地抨击美国的帝国主义态度。它认为，美国在会上的做法使人想起了过去反对危地马拉（民主政权）的丑恶行动的阴谋。它说：“美国希望研究一下加勒比海的局势，因为‘有共产主义渗透’。这是旧调重弹，这是干涉拉丁美洲国家掌握自己命运的再好不过的借口！但是，危地马拉事件在我们身上办不到。”
