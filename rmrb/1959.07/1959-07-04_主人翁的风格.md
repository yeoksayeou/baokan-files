    The Style of the Master
    The true quality of the working class lies in its diligent, conscientious, and responsible approach to revolutionary work, regardless of whether it is considered "big" or "small," "important" or "trivial." Su Baoyuan of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant, by diligently performing odd jobs such as sweeping the yard and wiping the floor, was able to solve a production problem with "waste" when the factory was manufacturing a 14,000+ kilowatt turbine. He kept every "small thing" in sight, recognizing its role in the great construction endeavor, and turned "useless" objects into useful materials.
    Old Su's noble style of being a master of his own house is forever worthy of our learning.
    We need millions of admirable Comrade Su Baoyuans!

    主人翁的风格
    工人阶级的本色，在于对革命工作，不分“大小贵贱”，都是勤勤恳恳认真负责地去干。沈阳第三机床厂苏宝元由于认真地做好扫院子、擦地板等勤杂工作，在工厂制造一万四千多瓩汽轮机时，他就能拿出“废品”解决了生产中的困难。他把每一件“小东西”都放在眼里，看到它在伟大建设事业中的作用，把“无用”之物变成了有用之材。
    老苏头这种当家人的高尚风格，永远值得我们学习。
    我们需要千万个可敬的苏宝元同志！
