The Fearless Man
    Li Shen, Zhong Ru, Cheng Wu
    On the morning of June 23, a group of maintenance workers from the small repair section of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steelmaking Plant arrived early at the bottom of Open Hearth Furnace No. 9 to continue dealing with the slag pot seats and slag track, which had been scarred by the steel leakage the day before. Oxygen cutters flashed with a bright white light in their hands, and more than thirty oxygen cylinders lay horizontally and vertically on the slag track.

    Above the platform, Open Hearth Furnace No. 9 gleamed with golden light and swirling flames. Steelmaking and slag track repair were proceeding simultaneously (which was permitted by the technical regulations). To ensure production safety, they were only loading 200 tons of molten iron today, much less than usual, and had decided not to release slag.

    Around 8:00 a.m., shortly after the workers of Ding Shift had taken over, the voice of the laboratory technician came through the loudspeaker:
    "No. 9 Furnace, carbon content, seven points, carbon content, seven points..."
    Zhang Xiwen, the foreman of Ding Shift at No. 9 Open Hearth Furnace, became anxious upon hearing this. Under normal circumstances, there would still be dozens of carbon points left after a heat of steel was refined, but this time, while still in the refining stage, there were only seven points left. How could this work? Wouldn't this heat of steel be wasted!
    A temporary "flying meeting" began in front of the blazing open hearth furnace. Some people advocated immediately increasing the carbon content by adding molten iron, while others believed that this would easily cause slag leakage. After much discussion, they decided that ensuring the quality of the steel was the most important thing, so they decided to add some molten iron appropriately.

    Chen Xiaofa, the chief engineer of the open hearth furnace, had arrived at the factory early that day. This veteran worker, who had lived next to the open hearth furnace for more than a decade, had been busy half the night dealing with the steel leakage from No. 9 Open Hearth Furnace, and had come again early this morning. When he heard that the carbon content of the steel was low and needed molten iron to be added, he thought of the small repair workers who were working on the slag track below the furnace. If slag leaked when the molten iron was added to the open hearth furnace, and the steel slag soaked the oxygen cylinders used by the small repair workers, it would be dangerous. Therefore, he found Zhang Xiwen, the foreman of Ding Shift at No. 9 Open Hearth Furnace, and told him to add the molten iron more slowly than usual. After saying this, he hurried down to the furnace.
    "Comrades, the carbon content of this heat of steel is too low. We need to add some molten iron. Everyone stop working for now and put the oxygen cylinders aside!" As he spoke, he waved his hand to the south. "Don't worry, Master Chen," the maintenance workers said: "The furnace isn't loaded as much today, and slag won't leak even if molten iron is added."
    "No, it's better to be careful." Chen Xiaofa persuaded everyone: "Today is not like usual. Although the furnace isn't loaded as much, the slag track is welded tightly, and the slag pot car can't move. Once slag leaks, there's no way to contain it. Take these things, for example," he pointed to the oxygen cylinders, "they will explode when they encounter high temperatures, and it will be a big trouble!"
    As they were talking, a huge hundred-ton crane passed overhead with a heavy rumbling sound. Chen Xiaofa knew that the molten iron had been transferred. Therefore, while helping everyone move the oxygen cylinders, he asked an assistant, Xu Zhongrun, to quickly go up to the open hearth furnace to get shovels, preparing to build an earthen dam next to the slag track to block the oxygen cylinders.

    At this moment, a burst of red light rose from the furnace, followed by a "popping" sound. Chen Xiaofa's heart began to tighten, and his eyes were fixed on the narrow slag discharge port above. He saw the molten iron ladle tilting its heavy body, and the molten iron immediately shot into the iron receiving port of the open hearth furnace like a fire dragon. Once, twice, three times in a row, the situation was very good, with only a few scattered slag drops falling. Then came the signal for the fourth addition of molten iron. As soon as the molten iron entered the open hearth furnace this time, they heard a "whooshing" sound inside the furnace. Based on his more than ten years of experience, Chen Xiaofa knew that the furnace was churning violently. He quickly told everyone to "be careful!" But before he could finish speaking, they saw red-hot steel slag pouring out of the furnace; first, just the middle door, and soon the east second door, the west second door... all five furnace doors plus two furnace heads were spewing slag at the same time! Chen Xiaofa shouted loudly, and just as he was about to rush over to stop it, the surging slag was already approaching the oxygen cylinders.

    Chen Xiaofa's heart immediately tightened like a fully drawn bow. At this moment, he didn't know where he got the strength from, gritted his teeth, picked up a shovel, and rushed towards the red-hot steel slag. Several shovels of yellow sand were thrown onto the surging slag, but the slag, as if not paying any attention, crackled and continued to rush towards the oxygen cylinders. He suddenly realized that it was not enough to rely on himself here using this method to rescue the situation. There were people on the platform, and there was also water... So he picked up his legs and ran towards the platform, shouting at the top of his lungs:
    "Quick, find rubber hoses and connect water to pour!"

    This thunderbolt-like shout shook every employee of No. 9 Open Hearth Furnace, and also alarmed Li Shaokui, the chief furnace operator of No. 7 Open Hearth Furnace, who was helping to deal with the accident at No. 9 Open Hearth Furnace. This famous steelmaking expert, who originally had no direct relationship with No. 9 Open Hearth Furnace, had been staying at this furnace helping out since the steel leakage accident occurred at No. 9 Open Hearth Furnace. At that time, he was discussing with Yu Deju, the chief furnace operator of No. 9 Open Hearth Furnace and a Communist Party member, how to make up for the losses caused by the steel leakage at No. 9 Open Hearth Furnace. When Yu Deju heard Chen Xiaofa's shout, he picked up his legs and went to find rubber hoses, preparing to pour water; Li Shaokui, turned around and ran to the scene of the accident as if flying.

    Li Shaokui tumbled and ran to the bottom, and saw the crackling slag, emitting flames more than an inch high. In his mind, there was only one thought: if he could rescue one oxygen cylinder, he would rescue one. However, as soon as he tried to move them, he felt that it was impossible to move them, because the oxygen cylinders were both hot and heavy. The only way was to pour water. There was nothing else nearby, only a shovel. He picked up the shovel, took a step and jumped to the side of the water pool below the waste gas valve, scooped up a shovel of water, and splashed it towards the oxygen cylinders. He splashed water shovel after shovel, but it didn't help. He didn't have time to find a more suitable tool, so he had to desperately run back and forth between the waste gas valve and the oxygen cylinders.

    At this critical moment, Hu Xiling, the gas inspection team leader and a Communist Party member, arrived after hearing the news. Li Shaokui immediately shouted loudly as if he had seen a savior:
    "Old Hu! Quick, find a bucket!"
    Hu Xiling turned around and ran. After a while, he found a bucket, and the two of them began to frantically pour water on the oxygen cylinders.

    Just as Li Shaokui and Hu Xiling were working frantically, a white light flashed overhead, and a torrent of rushing water poured down from the slag discharge port. They were shocked, thinking that the slag was leaking again! They looked carefully and realized that it was water. It turned out that after Chen Xiaofa ran from the bottom of the platform to the platform, he immediately ran to No. 8 Open Hearth Furnace with Yu Deju to move three two-inch thick rubber hoses, quickly connected them to the return water pipe on the west side of the open hearth furnace, turned on the faucet, and lowered them down the slag discharge port.

    More and more water was poured, and the flames of the steel slag disappeared, turning from red to purple, and from purple to black, gradually cooling down. ... A possible accident was thus eliminated!

    The good news spread quickly throughout the factory like a spring breeze. People laughed, shouted, surrounded Chen Xiaofa, Li Shaokui, Yu Deju, Hu Xiling and others, and offered them condolences and congratulations. At this time, on the entire open hearth furnace platform, the steel in the nine giant open hearth furnaces, arranged neatly, was boiling, followed by a series of crisp and pleasant steel tapping bell sounds.

    无畏的人
    立身　中儒　诚五
    6月23日早晨，鞍钢第一炼钢厂小修理工段的一部分检修工人，很早就来到九号平炉的下面，继续处理由于前一天跑钢焊得癞癞疤疤的渣罐座和渣车道。氧气切割器在他们手里闪着强烈的白光，三十多个氧气瓶横躺竖卧地放在渣车道上。
    平台上面，九号平炉金光闪闪，火焰缭绕。炼钢和处理渣车道齐头并进着（这在技术规章上是允许的）。为了保证生产安全，他们今天仅装二百吨铁水，比平时少装很多，而且决定不放渣。
    八点多钟，丁班工人刚刚接过班不久，扩音器里就传出化验室化验员的声音：
    “九号炉，炭素，七个，炭素，七个……”
    九号平炉丁班炉长张希文一听，就着了急。在通常情况下，一炉钢炼完了还有好几十个炭素，可是这次还在精炼呢，就只剩七个了。这怎么能行呢？这样下去，这一炉钢不就要白扔了吗！
    一个临时“飞行会议”在火光熊熊的平炉前开始了。有的人主张马上用兑铁水的办法增加炭素，有的人则认为那样容易跑渣。研究来研究去，觉得还是保证钢的质量要紧，于是决定适当兑些铁水。
    平炉总工长陈效法这天老早就来到工厂。这个在平炉旁边生活了十多年的老工人，为了处理九号平炉跑钢，昨天晚上他忙了半宿，今天一早又来了。他听说钢的炭素低，需要兑铁水，就想到小修理工人正在炉子下面处理渣车道；平炉兑铁水时要是跑了渣，钢渣子又浸到小修理工人用的氧气瓶子上，可就危险了。于是，他找到九号平炉丁班炉长张希文，嘱咐兑铁水时要比平时慢一些，说罢，就赶忙到炉下去了。
    “同志们，这炉钢的炭素太低了，要兑点铁水，大家先不要干了，把氧气瓶放在一边！”说着，他朝南挥了挥手。“放心好了，陈师傅，”检修工人说：
  “今天炉子装的少，兑铁水也跑不了渣。”
      “不，还是小心点好。”陈效法说服大家：“今天不比往常，虽说炉子装的少，可是渣车道被焊得死死的，渣罐车动不了，一旦跑起渣，可就没个收拢。就说这个家伙吧，”他指了指那些氧气瓶，“遇到高温就会炸，一炸起来可就麻烦了！”
    说话间，巨大的百吨吊车发着沉重的隆隆声，凌空而过。陈效法知道铁水已经调过来了。于是，一面和大家一起加紧搬氧气瓶，一面叫一助手徐忠润快到平炉上去拿铁锹，准备在渣车道旁边垒起一道土坝，把氧气瓶挡住。
    正在这时，炉上腾起一片红光，接着便传来“扑扑”声响。陈效法的心开始紧缩起来，两眼紧盯着头上那条狭长的放渣口，只见铁水罐把那笨重的身躯一歪，铁水立刻像一条火龙似的窜进平炉的受铁口。一次，两次，一连三次情况都非常好，只是稀稀拉拉地落下几点渣子。紧接着又传来了第四次兑铁水的讯号。这次铁水一进入平炉，就听到炉子里“呼呼”直响。凭着十多年的经验，陈效法知道炉子里翻腾得很厉害。他赶忙嘱咐大家“注意！”可是话音未落，就见火红的钢渣从炉子里冒出来；开始，只是中门，很快地东二门、西二门……五个炉门加上两个炉头一齐冒出来！陈效法大喊一声，刚要扑过去阻挡，说时迟，那时快，奔腾而下的渣子已经逼近了氧气瓶。
    陈效法的心，立刻像拉满的弓一样，这时，他也不知哪里来的那股劲儿，咬了咬牙，操起铁锹就向火红的钢渣扑过去。几锹黄砂扔在涌来的渣子上面，渣子像根本不加理会似地，嘁喳嘁喳地响着，继续向氧气瓶奔去。他猛然意识到光靠自己在这里用这种办法抢救不行，平台上有人，又有水……。于是拔起腿来就往平台上跑，边跑边破着嗓子喊：
      “快找胶皮管子接水浇啊！”
    这晴天霹雳般的喊声，震动了九号平炉的每一个职工，也惊动了正在九号平炉帮助处理事故的七号平炉总炉长李绍奎。这位和九号平炉本来没有直接关系的著名的炼钢能手，从九号平炉发生跑钢事故那时起，就一直呆在这个炉子上帮着干干这，干干那。当时，他正在和九号平炉总炉长、共产党员于德举研究着怎样弥补九号平炉由于跑钢而造成的损失。于德举听见陈效法的喊声，拔起腿就去找胶皮管子，准备浇水；李绍奎，一转身飞也似地奔向出事地点。
    李绍奎跟斗把式地跑到下边一看，嘁喳作响的渣子正冒着一寸多高的火苗。在他的脑子里只有一个念头：能抢出一个氧气瓶，就抢出一个。可是，等他一动手，便感到用搬的办法是不行了，因为氧气瓶又热又重，唯一的办法就是用水浇。就近没有别的东西，只有一把锹，他操起锹一个箭步就跳到废气阀下边的水池旁边，淘起一锹水就往氧气瓶那里泼。一锹水一锹水地泼不顶事，又不容许他去找更合适的工具，他只好拼命地在废气阀和氧气瓶之间，跑来跑去。
    正在这紧急关头，煤气检查组长、共产党员胡锡龄闻讯赶来了。李绍奎像见了救星似的立刻高声叫道：
    “老胡！快去找水桶！”
    胡锡龄听了调头就跑，不一会儿，找来一个水桶，两个人便发狂似地往氧气瓶上浇起水来。
    李绍奎和胡锡龄正忙得不可开交，头上白光一闪，从渣口那里，奔腾而下一股急湍的巨流。他俩大吃一惊，以为又跑渣子了！定睛一看，才发现是水，原来，陈效法从平台下跑到平台上以后，立刻和于德举跑到八号平炉搬来三根二寸粗的胶皮管子，迅速接到平炉西头的回水管上打开水龙头，就顺着放渣口放下去了。
    水越浇越多，钢渣的火苗消失了，红变紫了，紫变黑了，渐渐冷却了。……一场可能发生的事故就这样消灭了！
    喜讯像春风一样，迅速地在全厂传开了。人们笑着、叫着，把陈效法、李绍奎、于德举、胡锡龄等人围了起来，向他们慰问，道贺。这时，在整个平炉台上，排列整齐的九座巨型平炉里的钢水沸腾着，接着响起一阵阵清脆悦耳的出钢钟声。
