Ten Thousand Duck Beach

    The Duck-Hatching Girl
    From the small wooden window of the duck-hatching room, shines the smiling, flushed face of a Zhuang girl.
    This Zhuang girl is a graduate of higher primary school. She left school and went to work in the commune's sideline production team. She usually loves to talk and laugh, and although her voice isn't great, she especially loves to sing. Some people, finding it unbearable, would say, "Girl, you're just like a duckling fresh out of its shell!"
    Funny enough, she was later transferred to this duck-hatching room to take on the work of hatching ducks.
    She deeply loves this job. The moment she steps into this small house built of wood, her heart feels like it's soaking in a jar of honey. Especially when she sees the snow-white duck eggs placed in the warm kang and the golden-yellow ducklings that are hatched, she can't help but beam from ear to ear, her eyes wide open.
    This spring, while others wanted to increase grain production, she proposed developing sideline production and opening up Ten Thousand Duck Beach. This slogan, like a small firecracker, resounded everywhere. Who wouldn't be thrilled by this?
    From then on, she became even busier. Whether it's early or late, she's always looking forward to that tiny life, letting out its first soft, low call. Her songs always follow these batches of hatched ducklings, never-ending!
    This day, we saw her smiling face peeking out from the small wooden window. We knew that another batch of ducklings must have been born. When everyone went inside to take a look, it was indeed true. She was gently stroking a group of little things like downy balls, singing softly to them!

    Clouds on the Small River
    These days, new patches of clouds have been added to the blue, silken small river. They float over from the green slopes, from under the shade of the trees, from beside the newly built fence.
    In the morning, looking along the gurgling stream: the newly planted rice fields are like a green lake; the mountains covered with flowers are like a thousand peacocks spreading their tails; and these patches of clouds, in the thriving rice paddies, in the scattered flower petals, sway and sway, welcoming the golden dusk.
    This is the magnificent scene woven by the flocks of ducks at Ten Thousand Duck Beach. They bring joy to the lives of the commune members. The commune members all call these countless flocks of ducks a treasure of sideline production.
    When we arrived here, we heard the commune Party secretary say, "Raising ducks is a good thing. They grow quickly, hatched in May, they can be sold on the market in July, or kept to lay eggs. In winter, they can even be pickled into preserved meats. This constant flow in and out, isn't it the commune's most active income?"
    After hearing the words of the Party secretary, we loved the scenery of Ten Thousand Duck Beach even more. How beautiful are the clouds woven by the duck flocks! They are snow-white, brownish-purple, and light blue...
    Others say: the water is clear, and the mountains are verdant, the natural scenery is beautiful. We say it's not. It's these charming clouds that set it off, painted by the hands of thousands of people who love life.

    The Joy of the Duck Herder
    A long bamboo pole accompanies the duck herder; a newly woven raincoat accompanies the duck herder.
    The duck herder leaves early and returns late. The lush green mountains embrace him, and the gurgling streams flow at his feet.
    Ah, for decades! Time has spurred him on, and hardship has tormented him; but unexpectedly, now, he has become younger! New, shiny black strands have sprouted from his frost-tinged temples; the beloved duck-herding stick that had been broken by hunger is once again in his hands.
    Sometimes, as he sits by the water's edge, past scenes float before his eyes. But those dark shadows do not bring him sorrow; instead, he laughs aloud with pride. Because the old society that he hated has become a thing of the past.
    Look how energetic he is now! On this vast Ten Thousand Duck Beach, he herds thousands upon thousands of ducks, transformed into a true master.
    For this, he has composed his own song more than once:
    The commune leads me to the heavens,
    I drive the swans down,
    The swans cover the river beach,
    Surpassing the rosy clouds in the blue sky.
    Skillful duck herder,
    Willing to dedicate a red heart to the commune,
    Waving the bamboo pole to break through wind and rain,
    The duck flocks turn into rolling white silver.

    万鸭滩
    毛正三　霍新　周民震
    孵鸭姑娘
    孵鸭房的小木窗里，透出来一位僮族姑娘笑红了的脸。
    这位僮族姑娘，是一个高小毕业生，她离开了学校，就在公社的副业大队里工作。她平常爱说爱笑，嗓子不好，却特别爱唱，有人听得不耐烦了，就说：“姑娘，你简直是个刚出蛋壳的鸭子！”
    说也有趣，后来她真的被调到这孵鸭房里来担任孵鸭工作了。
    她深深地爱上了这个工作。一踏进这座用木头盖起的小房子，心就像浸在蜜糖罐里一样；特别是看见放进暖炕的，是雪白雪白的鸭蛋，抱出来的，是金黄金黄的小鸭，她就更乐得合不上嘴，闭不上眼。
    今年春天，别人要增产粮食，她就提出要发展副业，开辟万鸭滩。这口号像小鞭炮似的四处打响了。谁不为这事欢欣鼓舞呢？
    从此，她更忙了。不论早晚，她总是盼着那小小的生命，发出它第一声细微的低唤。她的歌，也总随着这一批一批孵出的小鸭，唱个不完！
    这天，我们看到露出在小木窗里的她的笑脸。我们知道，一定又有一批小鸭出世了。等大家进去一看，果真不错。她正轻抚着在一群像绒毛球似的小东西，那里低唱呢！
  小河上的云彩
    这些时，蓝丝丝的小河边上，新添了一片片云彩，它从绿坡上飘了过来，它从树荫下飘了过来，它从新围的篱笆旁飘了过来。
    早晨，顺着潺潺的流水看去：新插的稻田，像一片绿色的湖；布满花朵的山，像一万只孔雀开起的屏；而这一片一片的云彩啊，就在茁壮的禾林里，就在洒落的花片中，荡啊，荡啊，一直迎来金色的黄昏。
    这就是万鸭滩鸭群织成的盛景。它们给社员们的生活带来了欢快。社员们都称这数不清的鸭群是副业生产上的一宝。
    我们来到这里，就听公社党委书记说过：“养鸭是件好事。它长得快，5月孵出，7月就可上市，要不，就留着生蛋，冬天还可以腌成腊味。这样出出进进，不是社里最活跃的收入吗？”
    听了党委书记的话，我们更喜爱这万鸭滩的景色了。那鸭群织成的云彩够多美啊！它们有雪白的，有褐紫的，还有浅蓝的……
    别人说：这里的水清山翠，天然景色美，我们说不是。是这撩人的云彩衬托出来的，是千百个热爱生活的人们用手涂抹出来的。
    牧鸭人的欢乐
    一根长长的竹竿，伴随着赶鸭人；一件新织的蓑衣，伴随着赶鸭人。
    赶鸭人早出晚归。叠翠的大山环抱着他，淙淙的溪泉，流淌在他脚下。
    啊，几十年啦！岁月鞭策着他，苦难折磨着他；但，想不到现在，他却年青起来！他染着霜的鬓角，又抽出乌亮的发丝；他曾经被饥饿折断了的心爱的赶鸭棍，又拿在手里。
    有时，他坐在水滨，河边，过去的情景便会浮漾在他眼前。但是那阴暗的影子不会给他带来悲哀，他反而自豪地朗笑起来。因为，他所疾恨的旧社会，已经成了过去。
    你看，他现在多神气！他在这广阔的万鸭滩上，赶着成千上万的鸭群，变成了真正的主人。
    为了这，他不只一次地编出他自己的歌：
    公社引我上天台，
    我把天鹅赶下来，
    天鹅落满河滩上，
    胜过蓝天结霞彩。
    心灵手巧赶鸭人，
    要为公社献红心，
    竹竿一扬破风雨，
    鸭群变成白银滚。（附图片）
