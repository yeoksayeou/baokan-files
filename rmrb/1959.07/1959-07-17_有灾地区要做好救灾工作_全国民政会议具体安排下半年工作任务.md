    Disaster Areas Must Do a Good Job in Relief Work
    National Civil Affairs Conference Specifically Arranges Work Tasks for the Second Half of the Year
    The Civil Affairs Conference determined that civil affairs departments at all levels in disaster-stricken areas must make doing a good job in disaster relief work the urgent central task for the second half of the year. Under the unified leadership of the Party and government, they must coordinate with relevant departments to grasp the disaster situation accurately and promptly, report the disaster situation, conduct in-depth disaster investigations, and help the masses in disaster areas solve problems; they must earnestly do a good job in distributing relief funds and social relief work.
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Ministry of Internal Affairs convened the Fifth National Civil Affairs Conference from July 1st to 11th. The conference focused on discussing the tasks of the civil affairs departments in the future and specifically arranged the civil affairs work for the second half of this year.
    The conference made the following arrangements for civil affairs work in the second half of this year. Civil affairs departments at all levels in disaster-stricken areas must make doing a good job in disaster relief work the urgent central task for the second half of the year. Under the unified leadership of the Party and government, they must coordinate with relevant departments to grasp the disaster situation accurately and promptly, report the disaster situation, conduct in-depth disaster investigations, and help the masses in disaster areas solve problems; they must earnestly do a good job in distributing relief funds and social relief work.
    Attending the conference were directors of civil affairs departments (bureaus) from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as commissioners, governors, mayors, and county heads from some areas. Qian Ying, Minister of Internal Affairs, gave a concluding speech at the conference.
    When discussing future tasks, the conference pointed out that the Third National Civil Affairs Conference in 1955, based on the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, determined that preferential treatment, demobilization and resettlement, disaster relief, and social relief were the main businesses of the civil affairs departments. Practice over the past few years has proved that this is entirely correct. Civil affairs departments in various localities have actively carried out these four businesses and achieved significant results and rich experience. The conference believes that in the foreseeable future, preferential treatment, demobilization and resettlement, disaster relief, and social relief will remain the main businesses of the civil affairs departments.
    The conference requested that civil affairs departments at all levels continue to do in-depth and meticulous work in preferential treatment and demobilization work in the second half of this year. That is, on the one hand, strengthen political and ideological work, and on the other hand, effectively solve the livelihood problems of families of martyrs, military families, honorary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, better arrange their production and work, and mobilize them to play an active role in various construction undertakings. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen the education of the masses through preferential treatment and demobilization and resettlement work, and further establish the social practice of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families. Developing social welfare production on the basis of rectification and improvement, and actively running social welfare undertakings, is also an important task for the second half of this year. Civil affairs departments in various localities should actively do this work better than in the past, according to needs and possibilities.
    In addition, this conference put forward two more major businesses for the civil affairs departments, namely social welfare and personnel work in the government system. Social welfare refers to the welfare undertakings of the civil affairs work objects, such as sanatoriums and convalescent homes for honorary demobilized soldiers, nursing homes for families of martyrs, nursing homes for retired personnel of state organs, homes for the elderly, as well as welfare undertakings for the blind, welfare undertakings for the deaf and mute, and prosthetic and orthopedic undertakings. The personnel work of the government system mainly involves undertaking the appointment and removal, transfer, reward and punishment of cadres in the government system, the organizational structure of state organs, and the wages and benefits of state organ staff. The conference emphasized that it is very important to further clarify and promptly propose the main tasks of the civil affairs departments in the future. Civil affairs departments in various localities should, in accordance with the spirit of this conference, closely integrate with the actual conditions of their localities, and further do a good job in civil affairs work, so that civil affairs work can better serve the country's socialist construction and serve the central work.

    有灾地区要做好救灾工作
    全国民政会议具体安排下半年工作任务
    民政会议确定，有灾地区的各级民政部门，必须把做好救灾工作作为下半年的紧迫的中心任务。要在党政的统一领导下，协同有关部门及时准确地掌握灾情，报告灾情，要深入查灾，帮助灾区群众解决问题；要切实做好救济款的发放工作和社会救济工作。
    据新华社16日讯　内务部在7月1日到11日召开了第五次全国民政会议。会议着重讨论了民政部门今后的任务，具体安排了今年下半年的民政工作。
    会议对今年下半年的民政工作作了如下的安排。有灾地区的各级民政部门，必须把做好救灾工作作为下半年的紧迫的中心任务。要在党政的统一领导下，协同有关部门及时准确地掌握灾情，报告灾情，要深入查灾，帮助灾区群众解决问题；要切实做好救济款的发放工作和社会救济工作。
    参加这次会议的，有各省、市、自治区的民政厅（局）长，还有部分地区的专员、州长、市长和县长。内务部部长钱瑛最后在会上作了总结。
    会议在讨论今后任务时指出，1955年第三次全国民政会议根据党中央、国务院的指示，确定了优抚、复员安置、救灾和社会救济是民政部门的主要业务。几年来的实践证明，这完全是正确的。各地民政部门积极开展了这四项业务，取得了重大的成绩和丰富的经验。会议认为，在今后相当长的时期内，优抚、复员安置、救灾和社会救济，仍然是民政部门的主要业务。
    会议要求各级民政部门在今年下半年还要深入细致地做好优抚复员工作。这就是，一方面加强政治思想工作，一方面切实地解决烈属、军属、荣誉军人、复员军人的生活问题，更好地安排他们的生产和工作，发动他们在各项建设事业中发挥积极作用。另外，还要通过优抚和复员安置工作，加强对群众的教育，进一步树立拥军优属的社会风尚。在整顿和提高的基础上发展社会福利生产，积极办好社会福利事业，也是今年下半年的一项重要工作。各地民政部门应根据需要与可能，积极地把这项工作做得比过去更好。
    此外，这次会议对民政部门又提出两项主要业务，即社会福利和政府系统的人事工作。社会福利是指民政工作对象的福利事业，如荣誉复员军人疗养院、休养院，烈属养老院，国家机关退休人员养老院、敬老院以及盲人福利事业、聋哑人福利事业、假肢和矫形事业等。政府系统的人事工作主要是承办政府系统的干部任免、调动、奖惩，国家机关的机构编制，国家机关工作人员的工资福利等。会议强调指出，进一步明确和及时提出民政部门今后的主要任务，是非常重要的。各地民政部门应该根据这次会议的精神，密切结合当地实际情况，进一步做好民政工作，使民政工作更好地为国家的社会主义建设服务，为中心工作服务。
