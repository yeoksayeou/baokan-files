Act Flexibly According to Actual Conditions
Wushi Commune Party Committee Implements the Party's Guidelines and Policies According to Time and Local Conditions

(Our report) The Wushi Commune Party Committee and cadres in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, strengthen investigation and research in various tasks, proceed from reality in everything, implement the Party's guidelines and policies according to time and local conditions, further close the relationship between cadres and the masses, and encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for labor, so that all production proceeds smoothly.

When implementing instructions and resolutions from higher authorities, they always act in accordance with the spirit of the instructions from higher authorities and in light of the actual conditions below. For example, when implementing the policy of "planting more high-yield crops to harvest more," the county party committee assigned the commune the task of expanding the planting of grain crops by 4,000 mu. The commune party committee conducted a thorough survey of the commune's land based on the task assigned by the county party committee and conducted specific research based on soil quality, production conditions, and other factors. They also went down to discuss with the masses, and the masses unanimously requested to expand the area of grain crops and increase grain production. After the survey, it was proved that as long as the arrangement was reasonable and the cash crops were moved to the mountains, the task of 6,000 mu could be completed. Finally, through the practical efforts of the masses, 6,400 mu were actually completed. When the commune party committee assigned tasks to the brigades, it also adhered to the principle of "from the masses, to the masses." For example, when launching a large-scale thousand-jin high-yield competition, they adopted the method of conducting research layer by layer from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and then determined their own high-yield targets according to local conditions. The Jin Keng Brigade, which had poor production conditions, conducted a survey of each plot of land by themselves. They believed that of the 970 mu of early rice, only 485 mu could yield 600 jin of grain per mu based on past conditions, 320 mu could yield 400 jin, and the rest could only yield 300 jin. The average yield of late rice was only over 400 jin per mu, and the average yield of two seasons of rice was only 880 jin per mu. After careful analysis and investigation, the commune party committee fully agreed with the opinions of the masses. Seeing that the high-yield targets were implemented, the masses' enthusiasm for production was even higher.

When implementing instructions from higher authorities, the commune is serious yet flexible, and they always try to analyze the basis for completing the task. After making efforts, if they encounter inconsistencies with objective reality, they actively report the situation to higher authorities, put forward opinions, and make modifications. For example, the county party committee originally assigned them to plant 4,800 mu of cash crops, but because they lacked experience, they requested the county party committee to reduce the task.

In order to combine subjective wishes with objective reality, the commune party committee pays attention to going deep into reality first, holding forums for the elderly, young people, and middle-aged people, and conducting investigations and research before assigning tasks, determining production plans, and increasing production measures. In the process of investigation and research, they are good at listening to opinions from all sides. They do not adopt the attitude of "rejecting unpleasant words" or arguing back to negative opinions, but seriously analyze and compare them, so that the conclusions are more in line with reality. For example, when determining the density of close planting this year, the commune party committee secretary and the party committee went deep into their key (team) groups, held forums with people from all walks of life, listened to the masses' opinions on close planting, and summarized the experience of close planting last year. When Comrade Fu Ruilan, the secretary of the commune party committee, held a forum with old peasants in the Jin Keng Brigade to study close planting, commune member Ding Chun Lao Guan said: "Close planting is good, but it cannot be too dense. If it is too dense, it will be difficult to step on the fields. In the future, when the rice grows, it will not be ventilated. I think the experimental fields can be planted at 3×5 inches, and the large-scale fields can only be planted at 4×5 inches, 4×6 inches, or 4×7 inches depending on the actual conditions. Individual fields with poor conditions can also be planted at 6×8 inches. This is reasonable close planting." Based on various investigation materials, comparative analysis and research, and at the same time mobilizing the masses to summarize the experience of close planting last year, the commune party committee then determined the density of close planting according to local conditions. The same is true for other tasks. Commune members generally reflected that this year's production has several advantages: "Double-cropping late rice is good because it is adapted to local conditions; the technical measures for close planting are well implemented; the season is grasped early and well; the commune leadership's mass line is good."

The commune party committee not only pays attention to proceeding from reality in everything, but also conducts ideological education of seeking truth from facts for party members and cadres. In their actual work, the party members and cadres of this commune pay great attention to the working methods of the mass line and proceed from reality in everything. However, there are also a few people who have incorrect views: some believe that when resolutely implementing the instructions and resolutions of higher authorities, they cannot follow the mass line, or at least cannot fully follow the mass line; they juxtapose being responsible to higher authorities with being responsible to lower authorities. Some, when implementing instructions from higher authorities, do not take into account the specific circumstances of the time and place, but simply mechanically apply them. They don't like to hear different opinions or negative opinions. In view of this situation, the commune party committee on the one hand strengthens the ideological education of cadres to follow the mass line. Use facts to illustrate: the masses are most familiar with the intricate, complex, and varied natural conditions of the local area, and are most familiar with how each piece of land should be cultivated. Listening to the opinions of the masses more will make the work more in line with reality, and will also conform to the spirit of the instructions of higher authorities. The masses will be satisfied, and the work can be done to the best degree. On the other hand, the party committee goes deep into reality, sets an example, and lets facts educate party members and cadres. In the summer manure accumulation campaign, the commune party committee arranged to complete the task of accumulating 150 to 250 dan of manure per mu from June 10 to 25. Some people were afraid that they would not be able to complete the task due to lack of fertilizer sources. Comrade Fu Ruilan, the secretary of the commune party committee, went deep into the Bazhuba production team to produce together with the masses and held meetings of old peasants. As a result, they found ten sources of fertilizer and accumulated 14,500 dan of fertilizer in two days, increasing the average daily accumulation of fertilizer per person from 70 dan to 110 dan. On the 15th, the commune party committee held an on-site meeting of all cadres in the commune. In the face of facts, everyone understood the importance of following the mass line and acting according to actual conditions. Now, all 258 cadres in the commune can go deep among the masses, go deep into reality, participate in production, and lead production, thereby further ensuring that all work proceeds from reality.

    按照实际情况灵活办事
    乌石公社党委因时因地制宜贯彻党的方针政策
    本报讯　湖南省湘潭县乌石公社党委和干部在各项工作中，加强调查研究，一切从实际出发，因时因地制宜的贯彻党的方针政策，进一步密切了干部与群众的关系，鼓舞了群众劳动热情，使各项生产顺利进行。
    他们在执行上级指示、决议的时候，总是按照上级的指示精神，结合下边的实际情况办事。如贯彻“多种高产多收”的方针时，县委分配这个社扩种粮食作物四千亩的任务，公社党委根据县委分配的任务，对全社土地摸了底，按照土质、生产条件等情况，进行了具体研究，又深入下去和群众商量，群众一致要求扩种粮食作物面积，增加粮食产量。经过摸底以后，证明只要安排合理，把经济作物移上山去，可以完成六千亩的任务，最后经过群众的实践努力，实际上完成了六千四百亩。公社党委对大队布置工作时，也是坚持“从群众中来，到群众中去”的原则。比如在开展大面积千斤丰产竞赛运动时，是采取自上而下，自下而上的层层研究的办法，然后因地制宜地确定自己的丰产指标。生产条件较差的金坑大队，群众自己逐丘摸了底，认为早稻九百七十亩，根据历年条件，亩产粮食六百斤的只有四百八十五亩，四百斤的三百二十亩，其余的只能打到三百斤。晚稻平均每亩只四百多斤，两季水稻平均亩产只八百八十斤。公社党委认真分析和调查研究以后，完全同意了群众的意见。群众看到丰产指标落实，生产积极性更加高涨。
    这个社在执行上级的指示时，严肃而又灵活，他们总是尽可能分析完成任务的依据。经过努力以后，如果遇到与客观实际不符合时，就主动向上级反映情况，提出意见，加以修改。如县委原分配他们种经济作物四千八百亩，但由于他们缺乏经验，经请示县委后，核减了任务。
    为了使主观愿望与客观实际相结合，公社党委在分配工作任务，确定生产计划和增产措施前，都注意先深入实际，召开老年、青年、中年人等座谈会，进行调查研究。在调查研究当中，他们善于倾听各方面的意见，对于反面的意见，也不是采取“逆耳者弃之”或顶回去的态度，而是认真分析、比较，这样，就使结论更加符合实际。如确定今年密植幅度时，公社党委书记和党委都深入自己的重点（队）组，召开各种人参加的座谈会，听取群众对于密植的意见，总结去年密植经验。党委书记傅瑞兰同志在金坑大队召开老农座谈会研究密植时，社员丁春老倌说：“密植是好，但是不能太密了，太密了不好用脚踩田，将来禾长起来，也不透风，我看试验田可插3×5寸，大面积的田只能根据实际条件插4×5寸、4×6寸、4×7寸。个别条件差的田，也可插6×8寸，这样才算合理密植。公社党委根据各种调查材料，对比分析研究，同时发动群众总结了去年密植经验，然后才因地制宜确定了密植幅度。其他工作也是如此。社员普遍反映今年的生产有几好：“双季晚稻因地制宜好；密植技术措施贯彻好；季节抓得早又好；公社领导群众路线好。”
    公社党委不仅自己注意事事从实际出发，还对党员、干部进行了实事求是的思想教育。这个社的党员、干部在实际工作中，都很注意群众路线的工作方法，一切从实际出发。但是也有少数人存在不正确的看法：有的认为要坚决贯彻上级的指示、决议时，就不能走群众路线，至少也不能完全走群众路线；把对上负责和对下负责对立起来了。有的在执行上级指示时，不根据当时当地的具体情况，一味的去生搬硬套。一听到不同意见或反面意见时，就不喜欢。根据这种情况，公社党委一方面加强对干部进行走群众路线的思想教育。用事实说明：群众最熟悉当地自然条件的错综、复杂、千差万别的情况，最熟悉每一块土地应该怎样耕种。多听听群众的意见，工作就更切合实际，也能符合上级指示的精神，群众也会满意，就能把工作做到最好的程度。另方面党委深入实际，做出榜样，让事实来教育党员、干部。在夏季积肥运动中，公社党委布置6月10日至25日，完成每亩积肥一百五十到二百五十担的任务，有人怕没有肥源完不成任务。公社党委书记傅瑞兰同志就深入到八竹坝作业组，和群众一起生产，又召开老农会，结果找出十项肥源，两天时间就积肥一万四千五百担，由原来每人每日平均积肥七十担，提高到一百一二十担。15日公社党委召开了全社干部现场会。大家在事实面前懂得了走群众路线，按照实际情况办事的重要性。现在，全社二百五十八个干部，都能深入群众，深入实际，参加生产，领导生产，从而更进一步保证一切工作都从实际出发。
