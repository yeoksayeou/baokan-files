North China Radio Equipment Factory and Kunming No. 1 Steel Plant
    Launch Technical Skills Campaign
    Training Requirements: Trainees must understand general production knowledge and be familiar with professional skills. They must be able to explain operating procedures. Those who pass the test with excellent results will be issued a certificate of qualification.
    Xinhua News Agency report: The North China Radio Equipment Factory has launched a widespread "Technical Skills Campaign" among all its employees, organizing workers to diligently study various relevant technical operating procedures, achieving excellent results.
    This factory has many new workers and many new products, and many workers are not familiar with process requirements and technical operating procedures. In response to this situation, the factory generally adopted the method of one explanation, two examinations, three performances, and four issuance of qualification certificates in the "Technical Skills Campaign." The goal was to ensure that workers understand what kind of products are qualified and how to operate to achieve qualification. All workers actively and enthusiastically participated in the learning, and the learning content was determined according to the individual and the product, learning what was needed for the job. Production workers mainly studied quality standards, operating procedures, and familiarized themselves with equipment performance and usage methods. Inspection workers studied inspection procedures and the performance and usage methods of testing instruments. Each workshop selected technicians or engineers who usually understood the actual production and had basic technical knowledge to give lectures. After the courses were completed, everyone participated in examinations and operation demonstrations. Those who passed the examination, performed correctly, and produced a batch of qualified products were issued a certificate of qualification. Because the learning content was closely integrated with practice and the methods were diverse, the enthusiasm of the masses for learning was high, and the results were significant in a short period of time.
    Through the "Technical Skills Campaign," many employees systematically understood the operating procedures and product quality standards, thereby ensuring the improvement of product quality. For example, in the winding group of the paper dielectric capacitor workshop, out of eighty-seven winding workers, only five veteran technicians could fully understand the drawings before the study, and seventeen people could understand part of them. After the study, seventeen people could fully understand the drawings, and the remaining seventy people could basically understand them, thus eliminating quality accidents caused by not understanding the drawings.
    The "Technical Skills Campaign" also overcame the blind complacency of some new workers, improved the relationship between masters and apprentices, and strengthened the unity of workers and technical personnel. In the past, many new workers looked down on manual operations and despised their masters. Now, after listening to the master's lectures, they understood the relationship between their specific operations and the overall product quality, and felt that "although the operation is simple, the content is not simple," and that they should be determined to learn the technology.
    According to Yunnan Daily news, the Kunming No. 1 Steel Plant has launched a large-scale technical skills campaign, planning to train all existing grassroots management cadres and production workers in three months.
    The requirements for the technical skills training at this factory are that every production worker must learn general basic knowledge of steel production and be familiar with professional skills, and be able to explain the operating procedures. In addition to organizing training classes for full-time training, most workers will be trained through technical lectures, bedside training, summary of experiences at pre-shift and post-shift meetings, and exchange of experiences, continuously improving their technical level through production practice. In order to ensure the continuous development of technical skills training, they have also decided to concentrate on learning four times a week, two hours each time. They have also stipulated a technical assessment system, with "small tests every half month, large tests every month, and a final test every three months." Those who achieve excellent results will be issued a "certificate of qualification." To facilitate workers' learning of operating procedures, they will also organize specialized personnel to compile the operating procedures into "rhymes" and songs, and distribute technical manuals, etc., to facilitate memorization by employees.
    Currently, an atmosphere of diligently studying technical operations and technical theories has begun to gradually form throughout the plant. The steelmaking workshop has transferred some management cadres from veteran workers to follow work groups in each group, summarizing experiences and imparting technology by the furnace. The rolling mill workshop has held on-site meetings twice to focus on analyzing the causes of equipment accidents. Many workers are also intensifying their cultural studies in order to study relevant technical books.

    华北无线电器材厂和昆明第一钢铁厂
    开展技术大练兵
    训练的要求：既要懂一般的生产知识，又要熟悉专业技术；操作规程要讲得出；经过测验，成绩优良的，发给合格证。
    新华社讯　华北无线电器材厂在全厂职工中广泛开展“技术大练兵”活动，组织工人群众认真学习各项有关的技术操作规程，收到了很好的效果。
    这个工厂新工人多，新品种多，很多工人对工艺要求和技术操作规程不熟悉。针对这一情况，全厂在“技术大练兵”中普遍采取了一讲解、二考试、三表演、四发合格证的办法，要求通过这次“练兵”，使工人懂得什么样的产品才合格，怎样操作才能合格。全厂工人都积极热情地参加了学习，学习内容因人、因产品而定，干什么学什么。生产工人主要是学习质量标准、操作规程，熟悉设备性能和使用方法等；检验工人学习检验规程和测试仪表的性能及使用方法。各个车间都挑选了平时了解生产实际并且具有基本技术知识的技工或技术员来讲课。课程讲完以后，人人都参加考试和操作表演。凡是考试及格，表演正确，并且生产出一批合格产品的，就发给合格证。由于学习内容密切结合实际，方法多种多样，所以群众学习热情高涨，时间不长，收效很大。
    通过“技术大练兵”，很多职工都系统地懂得了操作规程和产品质量标准，因而保证了产品质量的提高。如纸介电容器车间卷绕小组，八十七个卷绕工，学习前只有五个老技工能全部看懂图纸，十七个人能看懂一部分；学习以后，已有十七人能全部看懂图纸，其余七十个人基本上也能看懂，因而消灭了由于看不懂图纸而发生的质量事故。
  “技术大练兵”还克服了一些新工人的盲目自满情绪，改进了师徒关系，加强了工人和技术人员的团结。过去不少新工人轻视手工操作，看不起师傅，现在听了师傅讲课，懂得了自己的具体操作同整个产品质量的关系，感到“操作虽然简单，内容却不简单”，应当下决心学习技术。
    据云南日报消息　昆明第一钢铁厂大张旗鼓地开展了技术大练兵，计划用三个月的时间，把现有基层管理干部、生产工人训练一遍。
    这个厂技术练兵的要求是每个生产工人既要学懂一般的钢铁生产基本知识，又要熟悉专业技术，对于操作规程要讲得出。训练方法除了组织训练班进行脱产训练外，对大部分工人将采取讲技术课、炉边训练、班前班后会总结和交流经验等办法，通过生产实践不断地提高技术水平。为了保证技术练兵的持续开展，他们还决定每周集中学习四次，每次二小时。并且规定了技术考核制度，“半月小测验，一个月大测验，三个月总测验”，成绩优良的发给“合格证”。为了便于工人们学习操作规程，还将组织专门力量，把操作规程编成“顺口溜”、歌曲，发技术手册等，便于职工记诵。
    目前，一个苦研苦钻技术操作和技术理论的风气，已经开始在全厂范围内逐渐形成。炼钢车间抽调了部分老工人出身的管理干部到各小组跟班劳动，在炉旁总结经验、传授技术。轧钢车间先后两次召开现场会，重点分析研究设备事故产生的原因，许多工人还在加紧学文化，以便学习有关的技术书籍。
