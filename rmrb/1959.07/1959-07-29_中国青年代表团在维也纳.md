　　Chinese Youth Delegation in Vienna
　　By Our Correspondent Xi Linsheng

　　The Chinese youth delegation participating in the 7th World Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship Festival has been in Vienna since the 22nd. But in this short time, Chinese youth have forged unforgettable friendships with the youth and people of Vienna. This friendship, like morning dew nourishing the earth, permeates the hearts of every Chinese youth delegate.

　　Arriving in Vienna Amidst Shouts of "Friendship"

　　As the train carrying the Chinese and Korean youth delegations slowly entered Vienna's South Station, the crowd of over two thousand welcoming people waiting at the station erupted into cheers and songs of "Peace," "Friendship," turning the station into a sea of jubilation.

　　As soon as the Chinese delegates got off the train, they were warmly surrounded by Viennese youth. The welcoming crowd, lined up densely on both sides of the platform, constantly and warmly shook hands and embraced the Chinese youth. The short journey of just over a hundred meters from getting off the train to outside the station and onto the bus took the delegates a full hour. Everyone said the same word when they met, "Friendship." It was this brilliant word that tightly linked the hearts of the youth and people of China and Austria, two countries thousands of miles apart. Many people shed tears of excitement for this deep friendship.

　　An old lady at the station kept telling others about her meeting with the Chinese delegation. She said, "He called me 'Mama' and even put a scarf around my neck." As she spoke, a light of joy shone in her kind eyes. An old man also wrote a letter to the "People's Voice of Austria" expressing his feelings when welcoming the Chinese and Korean delegations at the station. The letter stated, "In shaking hands and embracing these young people, one naturally feels that they are truly in their hearts fond of peace and friendship."

　　Like Being at Home

　　The residence of the Chinese Youth Delegation is a spacious four-story building. Although it is far from our motherland, we feel as warm as if we were at home. Before the delegation arrived, the Austrian friends in charge of cooking actively inquired about what Chinese people liked to eat. They cooked various delicious dishes according to Chinese tastes. Here, Chinese delegates can eat rice, various fried rice dishes, rice with toppings, and noodles every day.

　　In order to better arrange the food and accommodation of the Chinese delegation, twenty-five workers' family members come to do voluntary labor every day. They insist on providing free service for the festival and serving the Chinese delegation. Many children also give up their holidays and enthusiastically come with their mothers to help serve dishes and collect plates. Some working women also rush to help after getting off work.

　　In addition, many workers worked tirelessly to prepare everything for the delegation. An electrician, hungry, rushed to install the lighting for the Chinese art troupe's rehearsals. When people asked him to go to eat, he still insisted on finishing the lights before going to eat. At the residence of the Chinese Youth Delegation, Viennese residents and representatives of various organizations come to visit every day, some to greet and pay tribute to the Chinese delegation, and some to bring gifts and fruits.

　　On the Streets of Vienna

　　The weather in Vienna has been sunny these days. When members of the Chinese Youth Delegation stroll through this ancient and beautiful city in the sunlight, they often encounter many Viennese residents waving to the delegation's cars. On the streets, many people shake hands and greet members of the Chinese delegation, enthusiastically guiding strangers and answering inquiries, and exchanging gifts with each other. An old lady saw members of the Chinese delegation and warmly shook hands with them. She said that she had welcomed the Chinese delegation at the station and that although she was old, she was still full of energy and could participate in the Youth Festival. Many young workers took the initiative to come over and greet us. They said that in order to participate in the festival, they had brought their holidays forward. They wanted to make friendly contact with young friends from all over the world through the festival.

　　"We Love Chinese Art"

　　On the evening of July 24, the Chinese Youth Art Troupe held a pre-festival reception performance at the Ronacher Theater. The invited guests included about 1,700 prominent figures from Austrian political, cultural, commercial, artistic, educational, and other circles. The performance was very enthusiastic that day. This was something that had not happened at the Ronacher Theater for several years. In Vienna, audiences usually only enter the theater two or three minutes before the show starts. But on this day, a large crowd of audiences waiting to enter the theater was already crowded outside the door before seven o'clock. The theater had to open its doors early to receive the audience.

　　The program of the day's performance included Peking opera, folk song and dance, and acrobatics, with rich and varied content. During the three-hour performance, each program received warm applause. When soprano Guo Shuzhen sang works by Austrian composers Schubert and Mozart, the audience below the stage admired her deep understanding of the emotions of the works, her mature skills, and her accurate pronunciation. During the acrobatic performance of foot juggling, when two girls used the soles of their feet to rotate jars weighing dozens of pounds and throw them at each other, the audience below the stage thought the two jars would collide and let out exclamations. But when they saw the two jars accurately and safely thrown up and down and landed on their feet, the audience immediately burst into applause and cheers. During the intermission and at the end of the performance, many audience members took the initiative to shake hands and congratulate the Chinese delegates. One audience member said: Today's performance showed China's high level of culture and art, and made people see China's progress. Another audience member said: You study foreign things so diligently and sing our songs so well; but when we turn on the radio, it's all pop songs, and we've forgotten our own things. An old lady said: Although China is far away, I feel that I can understand China after listening to your music. One audience member also said: "Your art makes young people happy, but the yellow culture that is now imported into Austria makes our young people confused."

　　At the end of the performance, when a female audience member was asked what program she liked best, she replied: "Every time I watch a program, I think it's the best. But after watching the next one, I feel it's even better than the previous one. Now I don't even know which one is the best, because I think all the programs are good and have their own characteristics."

    中国青年代表团在维也纳
    本报记者　席林生
    中国参加第七届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的青年代表团从22日到达维也纳已经有几天了。但是在这短短的时间里，中国青年已经和维也纳的青年和人民结下难忘的友谊。这种友谊就像朝露滋润着大地一样，渗透在每个中国青年代表的心里。
    在“友谊”声中到达维也纳
    当中国和朝鲜青年代表团的列车徐徐驶入维也纳的南车站时，早就在车站等候着的两千多欢迎的人群中顿时响起了一片“和平”、“友谊”的欢呼声和歌声，车站成了欢腾的海洋。
    中国代表一下车，就被维也纳的青年热情地包围起来。满满地排列在月台两旁的欢迎的人群，不断地和中国青年们久久地握手、拥抱。从下车到站外再到上汽车这短短一百多米的路程，代表们足足走了一个钟头。每个人在见面时都说着同一个字“友谊”，正是这光辉的字眼把中国和奥地利两个相距万里的国家的青年和人民的心，紧紧地联结在一起。不少的人为这种深厚的友情，流下了激动的眼泪。
    车站上有一个老太太，她不时地向别人诉说着她和中国代表团的会见。她说：“他叫我妈妈，并且还把头巾围在我的脖子上”。说话时在她慈祥的眼中，闪耀着欢乐的光芒。一位老人并且给“奥地利人民之声报”写了一封信，表达他在车站欢迎中国和朝鲜代表团时的感受。信中说：“在同这些青年人握手拥抱中，使人自然地感到，他们是真正在心里爱好和平和友谊的”。
              像在家里一样
    中国青年代表团的住所是一座四层的宽大楼房。虽然这里远离祖国，但是我们却感到像在家里一样的温暖。在代表团到达之前，这里负责炊事工作的奥地利朋友就积极打听中国人喜欢吃什么。他们按照中国人的口味烹调出各种可口的饭菜。在这里，中国代表们每天能吃到大米饭，各种炒饭、盖浇饮和面条。
    为了很好地安排中国代表团的饭食起居，每天都有二十五个工人家属来义务劳动，她们坚持要免费为联欢节服务、为中国代表团服务。有许多儿童，也放弃自己的假期跟着妈妈兴致勃勃地来帮忙端菜、收菜盘。有的职业妇女在下班之后还抢着来帮忙。
    另外还有许多工人不辞辛苦地为代表团做好一切准备工作。有一个电工饿着肚子赶装中国艺术团采排的灯光。当人们要他去吃饭时，他仍坚持要装完灯才去吃饭。在中国青年代表团的住所，每天都有维也纳居民和各种组织的代表来拜访，有的向中国代表团问候和致意，有的还送来礼品和水果。
                在维也纳的街头
    这几天维也纳的天气晴朗。当中国青年代表团人员在阳光下漫游这古老而美丽的城市时，常常会遇到许多维也纳居民向代表团的汽车招手致意。在街头，不少人跟中国代表团人员握手问候，热情地为陌生的来客指引道路，解答询问，并且互相赠送礼品，有一个老太太看到中国代表团人员就热情地和他们握手，她说她曾经在车站迎接过中国代表团，她还说，虽然她年龄大了，但是她还满有劲，可以参加青年联欢节。不少青年工人主动过来向我们打招呼。他们说，为了参加联欢节，他们把假期提前了。他们要通过联欢节和各国青年朋友进行友好接触。
    “我们喜爱中国的艺术”
    7月24日晚上，中国青年艺术团在罗纳哈尔剧院举行了一次联欢节前的招待演出。被邀请的客人有奥地利政治、文化、工商、艺术、教育等界著名人士共一千七百人左右。这一天演出情况很热烈。这是罗纳哈尔剧院几年来所没有的。在维也纳，观众总是在戏开演前二、三分钟才入场。但是这一天，不到七时门外就拥着大批的等候入场的观众。剧场只得提前开门，早早地接待了观众。
    这一天演出的节目包括京剧、民间歌舞和杂技，内容丰富多采。在三小时的演出中，每个节目都获得了热烈的掌声。当女高音歌唱家郭淑贞演唱奥地利作曲家舒伯特和莫扎特的作品时，台下观众都为她对作品感情的深刻理解、成熟的技巧和准确的发音而赞叹。在杂技蹬技的表演中，当两个女孩子用脚底转动重几十斤的坛子，并且相互抛掷时，台下观众都以为两个坛子将相撞而发出了惊呼，但是当看到两个坛子一上一下准确地安然抛过而落在她们的脚上时，台下立即响起了一片掌声和欢呼声。在演出休息和结束时，许多观众都主动向中国代表握手祝贺。有一个观众说：今天的演出表现了中国的高度的文化艺术水平，使人看到中国的进步。另一个观众说：你们学习外国的东西，这样勤勉，把我们的歌曲唱得这样好；但是我们打开收音机都是流行歌曲，把我们自己的东西倒忘了。有一个老太太说：虽然中国很远，但是我听了你们的音乐，我感到我能够了解中国。有一个观众也说：“你们的艺术使青年人幸福，但是现在输入奥地利的黄色文化却使我们的青年糊里糊涂。”
    在演出结束时，当问到一位女观众她最喜爱看什么节目时，她回答说：“我在每看一个节目时，都以为这是最好的了。但是看了下面一个，又觉得比前一个更好。现在我自己也不知道那一个最好，因为我觉得所有的节目都好，都有特点”。
