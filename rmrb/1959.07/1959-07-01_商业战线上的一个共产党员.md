    A Communist Party Member on the Commercial Front
    By our reporter Wang Kongcheng

    In every corner of the motherland are distributed millions of Communist Party members. In the socialist construction of the motherland, they diligently, honestly, and conscientiously study and struggle arduously, acting as good servants of the people. Li Fenghua, a sales clerk at the Caishikou Non-staple Food Market in Beijing, is one of them.

    Customers who frequently buy things at the Caishikou Non-staple Food Market have a deep impression of Li Fenghua. This is not because this twenty-four-year-old young man has any prominent facial features, but because his care for customers is so meticulous. In the morning, someone comes to buy snacks. Li Fenghua thinks that he must be eating them for breakfast, so while giving him the snacks, he also poured him boiling water and brought him a stool. A customer buys cigarettes and tea. Li Fenghua takes the cigarettes, and as he is weighing the tea, he sees out of the corner of his eye that the customer opens the cigarette pack to smoke, but can’t find a match in his pocket, so he quickly hands over the matches prepared in the counter for the customers. A child comes to buy something, with many different items, and also needs change. Li Fenghua is afraid that the child will not be able to explain things clearly to his mother when he gets home, so he writes out a bill, and he is afraid that the child will lose the change on the way, so he wraps it all in the package. Before the child leaves, he repeatedly tells him: "Little one, be careful of cars when crossing the road!" Li Fenghua’s attitude towards customers is so warm that even the staff in the market praise him, saying: "You and the customers are just like family!"

    Li Fenghua tells others: "I want to reverse the old style of 'money for goods' of the past merchants through my own actions. The relationship between people in the new society is not a monetary relationship. To serve customers well, to make customers feel more comfortable, and to work harder, this is my goal." Therefore, he racked his brains to figure out the psychology of customers, to be considerate of them, and to meet their requirements. He believes that a good salesperson should not only have a good service attitude, but also be proficient in business. Therefore, he put a lot of effort into mastering business skills. In the past, it took him one minute and three seconds to tie four bottles of wine together, but now it only takes thirty-eight seconds. Once, he saw a person riding a bicycle on Luomashi Street scattering Jiangmi Tiao (a kind of fried dough twist) all over the ground. He went over to take a look and found that the rope was too loose. He silently remembered this incident. In the future, when he sees customers with bicycle license plates buying goods, he will definitely tie and wrap their goods well, and tie double ropes where they should be tied.

    One day, a customer asked Li Fenghua: "What kind of juice should a child drink when they have too much internal heat?" Li Fenghua said: "Buy some sour plum juice." As a result, the customer brought the goods back and had a big complaint, saying: "Eating this will make the child's internal heat even worse!" Another salesperson said: "Orange juice is good, it reduces internal heat." But it was not clear why it could reduce internal heat. In order to meet the customer's requirements, he went to the Beijing Food Factory at noon that day to inquire, and finally learned the different properties of sour plum juice and orange juice, and also learned that children who eat goat cheese should eat more orange juice. In the future, when customers buy goat cheese, he will tell them the benefits of children eating goat cheese and orange juice at the same time. Customers are very grateful for such thoughtful care. From this, he learned about the relationship between mastering product knowledge and serving customers. He adopted various learning methods to painstakingly study product knowledge. When he went to the processing plant to pick up goods, he would ask the workers to tell him about the knowledge of hard and soft candies. On holidays, he disguised himself as a customer and went to other stores to ask for advice. He used correspondence learning to contact food factories in Shanghai and Tianjin to understand the seven major manufacturing processes and five major benefits of canned food. He went to Shangyi Winery to learn about the characteristics of the eight famous wines in the country, went to the Monopoly Company to learn about methods of preventing mold in cigarettes, learned basic knowledge of tea from the Tea Company, and went to the Huashi Department Store to learn about product display. Although he only had a junior primary school education, he studied "Commodity Science," which comprehensively introduced product knowledge, late into the night every night. In addition, he also learned about the quality of cigarettes and the cooking methods of vegetables from customers. He also took notes when visiting commodity exhibitions. In less than three years, he finally mastered the characteristics, specifications, performance, origin, storage, and consumption methods of more than 2,400 kinds of goods. He used this knowledge to serve customers, making them feel unprecedented convenience and pleasure. A young man wanted to buy red rock candy as a medicine guide. Li Fenghua brought white rock candy. The young man said: "I want red rock candy, not white." Li Fenghua explained amiably: "The quality of red and white rock candy is the same. They are both made with pure sugar. In the past, some people liked to use red to mean 'auspiciousness'. In fact, just add some red color when boiling the sugar. Red rock candy is no longer produced, but white rock candy can still be used as a medicine guide." The young man was satisfied and bought the white rock candy and left. There was a time when milk powder was out of stock in the market, so Li Fenghua introduced to customers: "Substitute milk powder is just as good. One kilogram of substitute milk powder is equivalent to seven and a half pounds of fresh milk." He also explained the method of use. Customers who could not buy milk powder bought substitute milk powder instead.

    Through the study of product knowledge, Li Fenghua reflected the needs of customers to the factory and strengthened the connection between production and sales. He reported to the food processing plant that there were too few halal cream candies; that the bread from the No. 1 Food Society had a sour taste; that the products of the Wenbin Orange Juice Factory had a slightly spicy taste, etc. This played a certain role in improving products and improving product quality. He also brought the factory's opinions to the customers, eliminating their concerns about some products. For example, many customers like to use sand matches, but they cannot be bought in the city. After Li Fenghua contacted the match company, he told the customers: "Sand matches have a small production volume and are mainly supplied to farmers. Although they are convenient to use, they are not very safe in the city."

    Li Fenghua does not regard his achievements as private property, nor does he use them as a reason to be proud. He humbly believes that everyone serving customers is much more thoughtful than one person serving customers. In the study class organized in the whole store, he told everyone about his experience. In group meetings and elsewhere, he also helped others at any time. The other four members of his group, with his help, increased their knowledge of hundreds of products.

    Li Fenghua has won the honor he deserves for his loyal service to the people and his outstanding work. The Organization Department of the Xuanwu District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Beijing issued a notice commending him. The broad masses of the people love this young man. Whenever Li Fenghua gets off work, many people on the street greet him warmly. Some customers even give him tickets to sports games. Many middle school students come to watch him sell goods and tell him that they also want to be a good salesperson like him in the future. All of this makes Li Fenghua deeply appreciate the care of the revolutionary family for him. When he gave a report to students at a school, he said excitedly: "Comrades: My profession is incomparably glorious, but I am still not doing enough. In the future, under the guidance of the Party and with the encouragement of the comrades, I will work harder and continue to move forward!" (Attached picture)

    商业战线上的一个共产党员
    本报记者　王孔诚
    在祖国的各个角落，分布着千百万共产党员。他们在祖国社会主义建设事业中，勤勤恳恳、老老实实、努力学习、艰苦奋斗，当人民的好勤务员。北京市菜市口副食品商场的售货员李凤华就是其中的一个。
    经常在菜市口副食品商场买东西的顾客，对李凤华都有着深刻的印象。这不是因为这个二十四岁的小伙子面貌有什么突出的特征，而是因为他关心顾客做到了无微不至的地步。早上，一个人来买点心。李凤华想，他一定是当作早点吃的，所以在给他拿来点心的同时又给他倒了开水，还给搬来了凳子。一个顾客买香烟和茶叶，李凤华给拿了香烟，正在称茶叶时，斜眼看见顾客打开烟盒抽烟，可是在衣袋里却摸不着火柴，于是他就赶紧把柜里专为顾客预备的火柴递过去。一个小孩子来买东西，花样不少，还有找的钱。李凤华怕小孩回家向妈妈交代不清，就开了个账单，又怕小孩把找的钱丢在路上，就一起包在货包里。小孩临走他还再三嘱咐：“小宝宝，过马路时小心汽车！”李凤华对顾客的态度是这样亲热，连商场里的工作人员都赞许他说：“你和顾客就好像一家人似的！”
    李凤华给别人说：“我要通过自己的行动扭转过去商人‘一手交钱一手交货’的旧作风。新社会人与人之间的关系不是金钱关系。为顾客很好的服务，使得顾客的心情更加舒畅，工作得更加起劲，这就是我的目标。”所以，他千方百计地琢磨顾客的心理，体贴顾客，满足他们的要求。他认为好的售货员不光要服务态度好，而且业务也要熟练。因此，他在掌握业务技术上也下了很大的苦功。过去捆四瓶酒，需要一分三秒多，现在只要三十八秒钟就行了。一次，他在骡马市大街上看到一个骑着自行车的人把江米条撒了一地。他过去一瞧，原来是捆的绳太松。他默默地记住了这件事。以后他看到带自行车车牌买货的顾客，他一定给他们把货捆好、包好，该捆双绳的还捆双绳。
    一天，一个顾客问李凤华：“小孩子上火吃什么汁？”李凤华说：“买点酸梅汁吧。”结果顾客把货拿了回来，意见很大，说：“小孩吃这个上火更大了！”另一个售货员说：“桔子汁好，下火的。”可是为什么能下火，也不清楚。为了满足顾客要求，他当天中午就到北京食品厂去打听，终于知道了酸梅汁和桔子汁的不同性能，并且了解到吃羊奶酪的小孩更要吃桔子汁。以后，顾客买羊奶酪，他就向顾客宣传小孩吃羊奶酪同时吃点桔子汁的好处。顾客对这样周到照顾非常感谢。由这里，他了解到掌握商品知识，对为顾客服务的关系。他采取了各种学习方法苦心钻研商品知识。他到加工厂取货时，就请工人给自己讲软硬糖的知识。假日，他扮成顾客到其它商店去请教。他采用通讯学习的办法和上海、天津的食品厂联系，了解罐头的七大制造过程和五大好处。到上义酿酒厂去学习全国八大名酒的特点，到专卖公司学习纸烟防霉方法，向茶业公司学习茶叶基本知识，到花市百货门市部学习商品陈列。他虽然只有初小的文化水平，可是每晚攻读全面介绍商品知识的“商品学”到深夜。此外，他还向顾客了解香烟的好坏，蔬菜的作法。去参观商品展览会时也不住地记笔记。不到三年工夫，他终于掌握了二千四百多种商品的特点、规格、性能、产地、保管以及食用的方法。他运用这些知识为顾客服务，使顾客感到从未有过的方便和愉快。一个小伙子要买红冰糖作药引子。李凤华拿来了白冰糖。小伙子说：“我要的是红冰糖，不是白的。”李凤华和蔼地解释说：“红、白冰糖的质量是一样的。都是用纯沙糖熬的，过去有人喜用红色是图‘吉利’。其实熬糖时加上点红颜色就行了。红冰糖现在不生产了，白冰糖一样当药引子。”小伙子满意地买了白冰糖走了。有一个时候，商场里奶粉脱销，李凤华就给顾客介绍：“代乳粉一样好。一斤代乳粉顶七磅半鲜奶。”又给讲了使用方法。买不着奶粉的顾客都买了代乳粉。
    通过商品知识的学习，李凤华向工厂反映了顾客的需要，加强了产销间的联系。他向食品加工厂反映了清真的奶油糖果少；第一食品社的面包有酸味；文斌桔汁厂的产品有些辣味，等等。这对改进产品、提高产品质量起到了一定的作用。他还把工厂的意见带给顾客，消除了顾客对一些产品的顾虑。如不少顾客喜欢用沙子火柴，可是城里买不到。李凤华和火柴公司联系以后，就转告顾客说：“沙子火柴生产量小，主要供给农民兄弟，它虽然使用方便，可是在城里不大安全。
    李凤华把成绩不看成私有的东西，不作为骄傲的本钱。他谦虚地认为大伙为顾客服务要比一个人为顾客服务周到得多。在全店组织起来的学习班上，他把自己的经验讲给大家听，在小组会上，在下边，他也随时随地帮助别人。他们小组的其他四个组员，在他的帮助下，增加了几百种商品知识。
    李凤华以他忠心耿耿为人民服务的思想和出色的工作争得了应得的荣誉，中共北京市宣武区委员会组织部通报表扬了他。广大的人民都热爱这个小伙子。每当李凤华下班的时候，街上就有不少人和他亲热地打招呼。有的顾客还给他送来球票。不少中学生都来看他卖货，并对他说他们将来也要像他一样作一个好的售货员。这一切都使得李凤华深深体会到革命大家庭对自己的关怀。他在给一个学校的学生作报告的时候，激动地说：“同志们：我的职业是无比光荣的，可是我还作的很不够，以后，在党的教导下，在同志们的鼓励下，我要更加努力，不断前进！”（附图片）
