Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 26th - A million Cuban people held a massive demonstration and rally in the capital today, expressing their firm determination to support land reform, defend the revolution, and oppose foreign intervention.

　　Participating in this demonstration and rally were 500,000 farmers, revolutionary troops, workers, students, and government cadres from all over the country. The entire city of Havana was packed with people, and Cuban flags and banners printed with the words "July 26th" fluttered everywhere. Eye-catching signs displayed stirring slogans such as: "Implement land reform!" "Brothers, whether from the city or the countryside, unite in the revolution!" "If anyone invades Cuba, we will be the reserve of the Revolutionary Army!" Today's celebration began before dawn. At midnight, firecrackers exploded throughout Havana, bells and sirens rang out, and colorful fireworks filled the sky. Five hundred thousand farmers, traveling by various means of transportation, poured into the capital from all over, raising machetes and cheering as they marched through the streets, forming a mighty torrent.

　　At 10:00 a.m., a military parade of various branches of the Cuban Revolutionary Army was held in front of the Capitol building. B-26 bombers and T-33 jet trainers roared overhead. After the military parade, a vast crowd marched through the square. Cuban Prime Minister Castro and other government leaders reviewed the troops and the marching crowd from the reviewing stand today. Many foreign guests were invited to participate in the ceremony, including former Mexican President General Cárdenas, Chilean Popular Action Front President Salvador Allende, delegations and prominent figures from Latin American countries, and the Chinese journalists delegation currently visiting Cuba. Simultaneously with the parade, a naval and air combat exercise was held in front of the seawall. This exercise demonstrated the combat power of the revolutionary armed forces in defending the national territory and the revolution. The farmers applauded and cheered enthusiastically, paying tribute to the Revolutionary Army.

　　In the afternoon, a mass meeting attended by one million people was held at the Civic Plaza in Havana. President Dorticós announced to the assembly that Fidel Castro had accepted the people's request and agreed to continue serving as Prime Minister. At this moment, thunderous cheers rang out in the square, farmers threw their straw hats into the sky and raised their machetes, expressing their support for Castro.

　　Castro then spoke at the meeting. He said that 500,000 farmers will be 500,000 soldiers, and they will join the Rebel Army to prevent torture, evil, oppression, and poverty from returning. He emphasized that from today on, Cuba will implement land reform more widely. The Cuban government will continue to move forward with the support of the people, promote land reform, implement housing plans, build schools and hospitals, improve people's living standards, and maintain true justice. Castro said, "We will continue to move forward unswervingly, always relying on the poor." Castro stated that traitors will be suppressed, and national sovereignty will eventually overcome numerous difficulties and be maintained.

　　Castro then pointed out that defending the Cuban revolution is defending the freedom of the people of Latin American countries, and the Cuban revolution requires their support. No one should be afraid of our revolution, because if we are strong, it is definitely not to invade others. He said, "We are strong because our cause is just. Precisely because of this, no one can defeat us. We have the support of the people of Latin American countries."

　　Castro continued, "The road ahead is difficult, but the people are prepared to overcome all obstacles. No one can deceive or confuse the people. No one has the right to interfere in our sovereignty or criticize our activities. We do not have to inform anyone of what we are going to do, because we have the right to fight for our happiness." Castro pointed out that those who attempt to deny our rights are colonialists, exploiters, and enemies of the people's self-determination. "They are not only our enemies but also the enemies of their own people because they have aroused the hatred and hostility of the Cuban people. We cannot be friends with those who insult, slander, attack, and exploit us."

　　Castro's speech was greeted with enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    保卫革命反对干涉的吼声震撼哈瓦那
    古巴百万群众大示威
    卡斯特罗决定留任总理  表示坚决保卫国家主权
    新华社哈瓦那26日电　一百万古巴人民今天在首都举行声势浩大的示威游行和群众集会，表示支持土地改革、保卫革命和反对外国干涉的坚强决心。
    参加这次示威游行和群众集会的有来自全国各地的五十万农民、革命部队、工人、学生和机关干部。整个哈瓦那市人山人海，古巴国旗和印有“7月26日”字样的锦旗到处飘扬。醒目的标语牌上可以看到这样一些动人的口号：“贯彻土地改革！”“兄弟们，不管是来自城市的或来自乡村的，在革命中团结起来！”“假如有任何人侵略古巴，我们将是革命军的后备！”今天的庆祝活动从黎明前就开始了。清晨零时，全哈瓦那市爆竹声四起，钟声汽笛齐鸣，五彩缤纷的焰火满天飞舞。五十万农民乘着各种交通工具，从各地拥入首都，他们高举砍刀，欢呼着走过大街，形成一股巨流。
    上午十点钟，在议会大厦前面举行了古巴革命军各兵种的阅兵式。B—26型轰炸机和T—33喷气式教练机在头上低空呼啸掠过。在举行了阅兵式以后，浩浩荡荡的群众队伍通过广场，古巴总理卡斯特罗和政府其他的领导人今天在检阅台上检阅了部队和游行队伍。许多外国客人应邀参加了典礼，其中包括墨西哥前总统卡德纳斯将军，智利人民行动阵线主席萨尔瓦多·阿伦德，拉丁美洲各国代表团和知名人士，以及正在古巴进行访问的中国新闻工作者代表团。在检阅队伍的同时，在海防堤前举行了海空作战演习。这次演习显示了革命武装力量保卫国家领土和革命的战斗威力。农民群众热烈鼓掌欢呼，向革命军致敬。
    当天下午在哈瓦那公民广场举行了有一百万人参加的群众大会。多尔蒂科斯总统向大会宣布，菲德尔·卡斯特罗已经接受人民的要求，同意继续担任总理。这时，广场上响起雷鸣般的欢呼声，农民们把草帽抛到天空，举起砍刀，表示支持卡斯特罗。
    卡斯特罗接着在大会上讲了话。他说，五十万农民将是五十万士兵，他们将与起义军一起，不让酷刑、罪恶、压迫和贫困再回来。他强调指出，从今天起，古巴将更广泛地实行土地改革。古巴政府将在人民的支持下继续前进，推进土地改革，执行住房计划，修建学校和医院，提高人民生活水平和维护真正的正义。卡斯特罗说，我们将毫不动摇地继续前进，始终依靠贫苦的人。卡斯特罗表示，叛徒将遭到镇压，国家主权终将克服重重困难而得以保持。
    卡斯特罗接着指出，保卫古巴革命就是保卫拉丁美洲各国人民的自由，古巴革命要求他们的支援。任何人都不应该害怕我们的革命，因为假如我们强大，这决不是为了侵略别人。他说，我们之所以巩固是因为我们的事业是正义的。正因为如此，任何人也不可能战胜我们。我们有着拉丁美洲各国人民的支援。
    卡斯特罗继续说，前面的道路是很困难的，但是人民准备战胜一切障碍。任何人也欺骗和迷惑不了人民。任何人也无权干涉我们的主权和指责我们的活动。我们不必把我们要做的事通知任何人，因为我们有权为我们的幸福而斗争。卡斯特罗指出，企图否认我们权力的是殖民主义者、剥削者和人民自决的敌人。他们不仅是我们的敌人，而且也是他们本国人民的敌人，因为他们引起了古巴人民的憎恶和仇视。我们不能与污辱、诽谤、进攻和剥削我们的人做朋友。
    卡斯特罗的讲话博得了到会群众的热烈掌声。
