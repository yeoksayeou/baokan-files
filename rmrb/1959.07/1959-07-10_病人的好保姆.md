    A Good Nanny for Patients

    Nurse Fu Xiangwu has been a nurse since April 1949, never absent from work, and never had a medical accident, becoming a model worker in the Shenyang area military hospital.

    This Communist Party member, who regards the ward as his home and loves his job, experienced some emotional fluctuations when he started working. Someone told him: "Being a nurse means handling excrement and urine all day long. A man can do better in any other profession." At that time, the leadership educated him, telling him that revolutionary work only has different divisions of labor, and there is no distinction between high and low. All work is glorious. Since then, he has been determined to dedicate his life to the sick and wounded, to be their good nanny, and to be their confidant. For more than ten years, he has been caring for and comforting patients in the ward like a relative, helping patients send money, letters, and buy things. He said: "As long as I can satisfy the patients, I am willing to do anything." Once, he cared for a patient with lumbar tuberculosis. This patient became very irritable because he had been lying on a plaster bed for many years and often lost his temper. He thought: "How painful it must be for a person to be seriously ill and unable to get out of bed all year round." Therefore, he took extra care of him, feeding the patient food and water, washing his lower body after bowel movements, and chatting with the patient by the bedside whenever he had time. In this way, he served him for a whole year. When the patient was discharged from the hospital, he said with tears in his eyes: "You have reduced my suffering during my illness."

    Fu Xiangwu is a father of six children and has many household chores. Once, his wife was hospitalized due to pregnancy and childbirth, and the children at home became ill. At that time, he was working in the pediatrics department, changing diapers, feeding water, and giving injections to other people's children. The leadership asked him to go home and take a look, and he said: "Other people's children are the same as mine. Parents are worried when they are sick. I can't leave others alone and take care of my own children." In his work, he has always been cautious and responsible, never sloppy. He patiently checks and marks off every prescription, and repeatedly asks doctors and pharmacies to check for any doubts. Many errors were stopped by him. (Attached image)

    病人的好保姆
    护士富祥武从1949年4月做护士，从来没有缺过勤，没发生过医疗事故，成了沈阳地区部队医院工作者的标兵。
    这个以病房为家，热爱本职工作的共产党员，开始工作时情绪有过波动，有人对他说：当护士整天端屎端尿，男子汉干啥也比这行强。当时领导上就对他进行了教育，告诉他革命工作只有分工不同，没有贵贱之分，什么工作都光荣。以后，他就决心终生献给伤病员，做他们的好保姆，做他们的知心人。十多年来，他一直在病房里像病人的亲人一样照料安慰着病人，帮助病人寄款、送信、买东西。他说：只要能使病人满意，我什么事都愿干。有一次，他护理一位腰椎结核患者。这个病人因长年睡在石膏床上，性情变得很暴燥，经常发脾气。他想：一个人重病在身，一年到头不能下地，该多么痛苦。于是，他加倍地体贴照顾他，给病人喂饭、喂水，病人大便后给他洗洗下身，一有空还坐到病人的床边上拉拉家常。这样，他整整服侍了他一年，病人出院时热泪盈眶地说：“你减轻了我病中的痛苦。”
    富祥武是有六个孩子的爸爸，家务事很多。有一次，他妻子怀孕临产住院，家里孩子生了病。他当时在小儿科工作，正在为别人的孩子换尿布、喂水、打针吃药。领导上要他回家看看，他说：别人的孩子和我的一样，生病了父母都焦心，我不能丢下别人的不管，去顾自己的孩子。在工作中他还始终如一地谨慎负责，从不马虎大意，他对每一张药单都是耐心核对、钩销，发现疑点反复请示医生，向药房查对，不少差错在他手上挡住了。（附图片）
