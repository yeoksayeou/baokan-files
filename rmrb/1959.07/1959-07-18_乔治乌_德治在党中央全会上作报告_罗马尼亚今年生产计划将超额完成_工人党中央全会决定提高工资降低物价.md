    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest. The Romanian Workers' Party held an expanded Central Committee Plenum from the 13th to the 14th of July. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out that Romania's industrial output in one quarter of this year exceeded the total output for the entire year of 1938 before liberation. He said in his report that overall industrial production in 1959 increased by 45% compared to 1955, an average annual increase of nearly 10%.

    Gheorghiu-Dej said that the speed of socialist industrial development shows that the task of increasing industrial production put forward by the Party's Second Congress will be able to be realized, and the production plans for some major products will even be overfulfilled.

    Gheorghiu-Dej's report at this plenum discussed the achievements made in realizing the tasks set by the Party's Second Congress for developing the national economy and improving the material welfare of the working people. Local newspapers published this report on the 16th.

    Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out in his report that the Party's Second Congress, held in 1955, emphasized the need to adhere to the policy of realizing the country's socialist industrialization and developing all sectors of the national economy on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. The Party's general line for economic construction is the source of constantly improving the material welfare of the working people.

    When talking about the achievements made in developing the national economy, Gheorghiu-Dej said that between 1956 and 1959, thirty-eight industrial enterprises and forty new workshops were built, and one hundred and twenty-five existing enterprises were expanded and renovated. During this period, the production of means of production increased by 56%, an average annual increase of 11.6%. At the same time, the production of consumer goods in 1959 increased by 29% compared to 1955, an average annual increase of 6.5%.

    He emphasized that the creative initiatives put forward by the working people and the high tide of socialist competition show that the guarantees put forward by the workers and staff can be successfully realized, and the national production plan for 1959 can be overfulfilled.

    Gheorghiu-Dej said that significant achievements have also been made in socialist construction in rural areas and in increasing the yields of major crops. The socialist agricultural sector now owns 67% of the country's cultivated land, and has 2.5 million households. Between 1956 and 1959, the state allocated a huge sum of 8.7 billion lei for agriculture.

    When talking about the material welfare of the working people, he said that between 1955 and 1958, the total monetary income of the working people from wages increased by 5.7 billion lei. Significant achievements have also been made in improving the living standards of farmers.

    Gheorghiu-Dej then talked about new measures to improve the welfare of the working people, including raising wages, reducing wage income tax, and increasing subsidies. These measures can increase the actual income of workers, disabled people, and the elderly by 4.7 billion lei per year.

    He pointed out that the real wages of Romanian workers and staff in 1959 increased by more than 30% compared to 1955, so that the task of increasing real wages stipulated by the Party's Second Congress was achieved one year ahead of schedule.

    Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that increasing labor productivity, reducing production costs, and constantly increasing national income are the only reliable ways to improve the living standards of the working people.

    Gheorghiu-Dej said that the Party and trade union organizations should conduct extensive work to attract the working people to participate in socialist competition in order to discover and utilize internal potential and reduce production costs in various economic sectors.

    Gheorghiu-Dej said that a bright prospect of basically completing socialist construction and transitioning to building socialism is unfolding before our people. This great goal inspires our working people to move towards new victories in their creative labor.

    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 15th. The Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, at its expanded plenary session held from the 13th to the 14th of July, adopted a resolution to increase wages and reduce prices.

    According to the resolution, from August 1st of this year, workers' wages will increase by an average of 10%, the wages of engineers, technicians, administrative personnel in production departments, and staff in state organs will increase by an average of 8%, and the salaries of service personnel in the socialist commercial sector, teachers in general secondary schools and technical vocational schools, and officers and generals of the armed forces will also be increased.

    乔治乌—德治在党中央全会上作报告
    罗马尼亚今年生产计划将超额完成
    工人党中央全会决定提高工资降低物价
    据新华社布加勒斯特讯　罗马尼亚工人党于13日至14日举行了中央扩大全体会议。罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治在会上作了报告。他指出罗马尼亚今年一个季度的工业产量比解放前1938年全年的产量还要多。他在报告中说，1959年整个工业生产比1955年增长45％，平均每年增长近10％。
    乔治乌—德治说，社会主义工业发展的速度表明，党的第二次代表大会提出的关于增加工业生产的任务将能够实现，而一些主要产品的生产计划甚至将超额完成。
    乔治乌—德治在这次全会上所作的报告中，谈到了在实现党的第二次代表大会提出的发展国民经济和增进劳动人民物质福利的任务方面所取得的成就。此间报纸在16日刊载了这个报告。
    乔治乌—德治在报告中指出，1955年召开的党的第二次代表大会强调必须坚持实现国家社会主义工业化的政策，在优先发展重工业的基础上发展所有国民经济部门。党的这个经济建设总路线是不断提高劳动人民的物质福利的源泉。
    在谈到发展国民经济方面所取得的成就时，乔治乌—德治说，在1956年到1959年期间，建设了三十八个工业企业和四十个新车间，扩建和改建了一百二十五个原有企业。在这期间，生产资料的生产增长了56％，平均每年增长11.6％。与此同时，1959年消费资料的生产比1955年增长29％，平均每年增长6.5％。
    他强调说，劳动人民提出的创造性的倡议和社会主义竞赛的高涨表明，职工们提出的保证将可以胜利地实现，1959年国家生产计划将可以超额完成。
    乔治乌—德治说，在农村社会主义建设和提高主要农作物的产量方面也取得了重大成就。现在社会主义农业部门拥有的耕地占全国耕地面积的67％，拥有的农户达二百五十万户。在1956年到1959年期间，国家为农业拨出了共计八十七亿列伊的巨额资金。
    在谈到劳动人民的物质福利时，他说，在1955年到1958年期间，劳动人民从工资中所得到的货币收入总共增长了五十七亿列伊。在提高农民的生活水平方面也获得了重大成绩。
    乔治乌—德治接着谈到了提高劳动人民福利的新措施，这些措施包括提高工资、减少工资所得税和增加补助金等。这些措施可以使职工、残废者和年老的实际收入每年增加四十七亿列伊。
    他指出，罗马尼亚工人和职员的实际工资在1959年比1955年增加了30％以上，这样，党的第二次代表大会规定的关于增加实际工资的任务就提前一年实现。
  乔治乌—德治指出，提高劳动生产率、降低生产成本、不断增加国民收入，是提高劳动人民生活水平的唯一可靠的方法。
    乔治乌—德治说，党和工会组织应当进行广泛的工作，吸引劳动人民参加社会主义竞赛，以便发掘和利用内部潜力，降低各个经济部门中的生产费用。
    乔治乌—德治说，在我国人民面前展现着基本上完成社会主义建设和过渡到建成社会主义的光辉前景。这一伟大的目标鼓舞着我国劳动人民在他们创造性的劳动中走向新的胜利。
    新华社布加勒斯特15日电　罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会在13日到14日举行的全会扩大会议上，通过了增加工资和减低物价的决议。
    根据决议，从今年8月1日起，工人的工资平均将增加10％，工程师、技术人员、生产部门的行政人员和国家机关工作人员的工资平均将增加8％，在社会主义商业部门的服务人员、普通中学和技术业余学校的教师以及武装部队的军官和将军的薪资也将有所增加。决议规定，从今年8月15日起减低二千六百种工业品和食品的价格。
