    A Visit to the Dashushan Pig Farm
    By our reporter Han Guozhen

    Stepping into the Dashushan Commune pig farm in the suburbs of Hefei, the neat pigsties and the scrubbed-clean stone troughs bring a feeling of joy.

    Approaching a pigpen, one sees a fat pig sleeping soundly. Director Yang of the commune said that the pig farm has a total of four thousand five hundred and thirty pigs, including four hundred sows, four thousand one hundred fattening pigs and piglets, and thirty breeding pigs. Because of the implementation of the contract work and output system this year, along with the division of responsibilities and the strengthening of medical work, the breeding of piglets has been very rapid. Since April, the phenomenon of pig deaths has been eliminated throughout the farm.

    On the floor of the veterinary room are piles of bark and peach leaves, the raw materials the veterinarian is using to trial-produce an aphrodisiac herbal medicine to increase the reproductive capacity of sows. This year, the commune decided to move the veterinary room near the pig farm, which not only allows for timely treatment but also allows for reasonable allocation of feed together with the feeders, and for responsible inspection of pigsty hygiene. In my impression, the hygiene work of this pig farm is indeed quite outstanding. There is a sick pig isolation room here to prevent the infection of healthy pigs. The young female veterinarian, Li Fanglan, said with a smile: "There are only four pigs staying in the 'hospital' now, and three of them can return to the pen in two or three days."

      "Nurse" Jin Shaochuan is stirring feed in the "hospital." He said seriously: "Serving sick pigs is a meticulous job. In addition to diligent care, it is also necessary to understand the condition and adjust the treatment accordingly." Last month, a pig in the farm contracted a cold and was paralyzed for more than forty days, but with Jin Shaochuan's day and night care and treatment, the sick pig finally recovered its health.

    At the gate of the sow pen, feeder Xu Bangming is doing cleaning work. He is a very outstanding feeder, not only highly responsible but also knows how to feed pigs. For example, sows should be fed more coarse grains and less concentrated feed within fifty days after entering the pen, because if they are fed too well at this time, the sows will grow too much fat and easily squeeze out the piglets in their bellies; after eighty days, the piglets have taken shape, so they should be fed more concentrated feed so that the sows get enough nutrition, so that they will produce more milk in the future and the survival rate of the piglets will be high. The thirty-six sows raised by Xu Bangming each produced more than thirteen piglets, with a survival rate of 100%.

    Of particular note are the several tall and fat large pigs. These are raised by the feeder Zhu Shanrong. These pigs grow especially fat because they use the methods of double cutting (cutting ears, cutting tails) and six injections (injecting milk, glucose, cod liver oil, etc.). The feeding work is also done scientifically and meticulously, such as feeding on time and grazing on time.

    At present, the Dashushan Commune pig farm is carrying out the "ten thousand pigs" movement. Director Yang of the commune said excitedly: Now the farm has already calculated the pig source account and decided to keep all the small sows as old sows to expand the pig source. In order to ensure the supply of feed, the farm has reclaimed 350 mu of land to plant feed such as pumpkin, buckwheat, and cowpea, and there are also 40 mu of ponds, which raise water hyacinth and "revolutionary grass" and other pig feed.

    All the feeders in the farm are highly motivated and are carrying out a red flag competition in order to raise pigs well. By the end of August this year, this place will become a "ten thousand pigs" farm.

    大蜀山猪场巡礼
    本报记者　韩国珍
    走进合肥市郊大蜀山公社养猪场，那整洁的猪圈，洗刷得十分干净的石槽，给人带来了喜悦的心情。
    走近猪栏，只见一头肥猪酣睡着。公社杨主任说，这个猪场共有四千五百三十头猪，其中母猪四百头，肥猪和仔猪四千一百头，种猪三十头。由于今年实行了包工包产，分工负责的制度，加强了医疗工作，所以猪仔繁殖得很快。从4月份以来，全场已经消灭了死猪的现象。
    在兽医室的地面上，堆着许多树皮和桃树叶，这是兽医为了提高母猪繁殖力，试制催情土药的原料。今年公社决定把兽医室搬到猪场附近，这不仅可以及时治疗，还可以和饲养员一道合理地调配饲料，负责检查猪圈卫生。在我的印象里，这个猪场的卫生工作的确搞得相当出色。这里有病猪隔离室，防止感染好猪。年轻的女兽医李芳兰笑着说：“现在住‘病房’的猪只有四头，其中三头过三两天也可回圈了。”
      “病房”的“看护”金绍传正搅拌着饲料。他认真地说：“侍候病猪是一件细心的工作。除了勤于照料，还要弄清病情，分别调理。”上个月，场里有头猪得了寒症，瘫痪四十多天，但在金绍传不分日夜地看护治疗下，这头病猪终于恢复了健康。
    在老母猪的圈栏门口，饲养员许帮明正在做清洁工作。他是一个很出色的饲养员，不仅责任心强，而且懂得如何喂养猪。譬如，母猪上栏后的五十天内要多喂粗粮，少搭精饲料，因为这时喂得太好，老母猪会尽长油，容易把肚里的小猪挤掉；八十天以后小猪已定型，就应该多喂精饲料，使母猪得到充分的营养，将来出奶多，小猪成活率高。许帮明喂养的三十六头老母猪，头头产仔在十三头以上，成活率达到了百分之百。
    引人注意的是那几头又高又肥的大猪。这是饲养员朱善荣负责喂养的。这些猪长得特别肥，是由于采用了二割（割耳朵、割尾巴）、六注射（注射牛奶、葡萄糖、鱼肝油等）的办法。饲养工作也做得科学细致，譬如按时喂食、按时放牧等。
    目前，大蜀山公社的养猪场正在开展“万头猪”运动。公社杨主任兴奋地说：现在场里已经算好了猪源账，决定将小母猪，全部留作老母猪，以扩大猪源。为了保证饲料供给，场内已开垦三百五十亩地种上了南瓜、苦麦、牛皮菜等饲料，还有四十亩水塘，养殖了水浮莲和“革命草”等猪饲料。
    全场饲养员干劲都很大，为了把猪养好，全场正在开展红旗竞赛。今年8月底，这里便成为“万头猪”场了。
