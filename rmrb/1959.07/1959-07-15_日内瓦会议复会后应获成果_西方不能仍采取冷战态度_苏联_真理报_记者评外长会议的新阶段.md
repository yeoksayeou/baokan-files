Soviet "Pravda" Reporter Comments on the New Stage of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting
    Our Moscow dispatch, July 13th. The Soviet "Pravda" today published an article by its special correspondent in Geneva, Naumov, dated July 12th from Geneva, entitled "Facing the New Stage of the Geneva Talks."
    The article said that the three-week recess of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting has ended, and the ministers have returned to Geneva. The doors of the Geneva "Press House" are open again. Here, one can again hear the deafening sounds from the telephone booths and the sound of typing, while all kinds of rumors are spreading artificially, although there is no basis for this. Activists from some Western countries are also spreading this mood. Before going to Geneva, U.S. Secretary of State Herter said at a press conference two days earlier that he was not very optimistic about the second stage of the talks, and he did not intend to stay in Geneva for more than three weeks. He also said at the Geneva airport that he had not returned to Geneva with great hope. Such remarks have aroused certain doubts. The Soviet Union's recent proposals on the Berlin issue fully take into account the views of Western governments. The Soviet Union is prepared to sign a temporary agreement on West Berlin with the United States, Britain, and France. The Soviet Union proposes that an all-German committee be composed of representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The Soviet Union's new proposals are not unilateral but are to resolve the Berlin issue on the basis of consultation. These proposals were put forward shortly before the Geneva meeting was adjourned. At that time, Western countries did not make a formal response to these proposals. However, world opinion welcomed the Soviet proposals. Newspapers everywhere unanimously pointed out that the Soviet proposals opened the door to reaching an agreement. But suddenly there were pessimistic tones. These tones can only show that some political figures in the West are unwilling to understand the substance of the Soviet proposals and want to continue negotiations with a Cold War attitude.
    The "Pravda" reporter continued to point out that it is worth noting that the West German newspapers are demanding that the Berlin issue be removed from the agenda of the Geneva meeting, and this clamor from the Bonn ruling group has also been echoed between the United States and France. It is still difficult to predict what difficulties this clamor will bring to the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, but one thing is clear: the opponents of international cooperation are doing their best to divert public attention from the fundamental issues concerning the fate of world peace and to make the Geneva meeting fall into empty talk.
    The "Pravda" reporter continued, today, on the eve of the resumption of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Meeting, the Western foreign ministers held a meeting. According to newspapers, the purpose of this meeting was to unify Western strategies. The Italian Foreign Minister also made a special trip to attend this meeting. This goes beyond the scope of the Geneva meeting. Will this measure help improve the political climate of the Geneva meeting? Of course not. Tomorrow, the Foreign Ministers' Meeting will resume, and the world public will once again focus its attention on Geneva. They are waiting for the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Meeting to achieve real results so that the cold international climate can warm up and help the upcoming summit meeting to find fundamental solutions to urgent international problems.

    日内瓦会议复会后应获成果
    西方不能仍采取冷战态度
    苏联“真理报”记者评外长会议的新阶段
    本报莫斯科13日电　苏联“真理报”今天发表了日内瓦特派记者瑙莫夫12日从日内瓦发出的题为“面临日内瓦会谈新阶段”的文章。
    文章说，外长会议的三星期休会已经结束，部长们又来到了日内瓦。日内瓦“记者之家”的大门打开了。这里又可以听到从电话间里传出来的震耳欲聋的声音和打字声音，同时又传出种种谣言，悲观的情绪正在被人为地散布，虽然这是没有任何根据的。西方某些国家的活动家也在散布这种情绪。美国国务卿赫脱在去日内瓦前两天在记者招待会上说，他对第二阶段的会谈不很乐观，他不打算在日内瓦呆三个星期以上。他在日内瓦机场也说，他是没有抱很大希望回到日内瓦来的。这样的讲话引起了一定的疑虑。苏联关于柏林问题最近的建议充分估计到了西方国家政府的观点。苏联准备和美国、英国、法国签订关于西柏林的临时协议。苏联建议由德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国代表组成全德委员会。苏联的新建议不是单方面而是在协商的基础上来解决柏林问题。这些建议是在日内瓦会议宣布休会前不久提出的。当时，西方国家对这些建议没有作出正式答复。但是，世界舆论欢迎苏联建议。各地报刊都一致指出苏联建议打开了达成协议的大门。但是，忽然有了悲观的论调。这些论调只能说明西方的一些政界人物不愿意了解苏联建议的实质，而想用冷战的态度来继续谈判。
      “真理报”记者继续指出，值得注意的是西德的报刊要求日内瓦会议上撤销柏林问题议程，波恩统治集团的这一种叫嚣也在美国和法国之间得到响应。暂时还难推测这种叫嚣会给外长会议带来怎样的困难，但有一点是清楚的：国际合作的反对者们正在尽其全力转移社会公众对关系世界和平命运的根本问题的注意，而使日内瓦会议陷入空谈的局面。
      “真理报”记者继续说，今天在日内瓦外长会议复会前夕，西方外长们举行了会见。据报纸报道，这次会见的目的是为了统一西方的策略。意大利外长也专门赶来参加这次会见。这是超越了日内瓦会议的范围的。这种措施是否有助于改善日内瓦会议的政治气候呢？当然没有。明天，外长会议复会，世界公众将重新注视日内瓦。他们正在等待日内瓦外长会议取得真正的成果，以便使寒冷的国际气候回暖，并且能够帮助将要举行的最高级会议对迫切的国际问题获得根本解决的办法。
