Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Ministry of Agriculture issued a "Notice on Strengthening the Prevention and Control of Autumn Locusts" on July 13, requesting the agricultural departments of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces to make labor arrangements and other preparations early in order to eliminate autumn locusts in a timely manner.

The notice stated that this year, the area of summer locusts in the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu is large, and the density is high. In many places, prevention and control is not thorough, there are many residual adults, and many eggs have been laid. It is expected that autumn locusts will hatch in large numbers in mid-July. In order to seize the favorable opportunity to eliminate locusts before the third instar, the notice put forward the following points:

1. Strengthen the leadership in eliminating autumn locusts. Formulate prevention and control plans, quickly rectify the teams, fix locust control cadres, organize professional teams and investigators, accurately grasp the locust situation, and organize forces in a timely manner to eliminate locust nymphs in order to reduce the spread of autumn locusts. Close attention should be paid to areas with high residual density, heavy prevention and control tasks, and dewatered areas along Hongze Lake and the Huai River.

2. All localities should be careful in planning and using pesticides rationally; vigorously give play to the role of dusting equipment. Where tools are insufficient, cloth bags, sacks, bellows, and other dusting tools should be promoted. Where there is wheat bran and wheat middlings, poisonous bait can be used to control locusts, which saves labor and pesticides. In addition, "Wolfsbane" indigenous pesticides can be mixed with "666" to make poisonous bait to control locusts, but "Wolfsbane" is highly toxic and safety must be ensured.

3. Areas with large mechanized autumn locust control areas should consider establishing fixed airports to facilitate operations even after rain; more forward airports should be set up to reduce air flight time. Fully exploit the potential of aircraft prevention and control. Areas without mechanized tasks must vigorously mobilize the masses and make all preparations to eliminate autumn locusts in a timely manner.

    农业部要求冀鲁豫苏皖及早做好准备
    抓紧时机　消灭秋蝗
    新华社15日讯　农业部在7月13日发出“关于加强防治秋蝗工作的通知”，要求河北、山东、河南、江苏和安徽五省农业部门提早作好劳力安排和其它准备工作，以便及时消灭秋蝗。
    通知说，今年冀、鲁、豫、皖、苏五省夏蝗发生面积大，密度稠，不少地方防治不彻底，残留成虫多，产卵不少，预计7月中旬秋蝗将大量孵化出土。为了抓紧有利时机，将蝗虫消灭在三龄成期以前。通知提出了如下几点意见：
    1、加强消灭秋蝗的领导。制订防治计划，迅速整顿队伍，固定治蝗干部，组织好专业队和侦查员，准确掌握蝗情，及时组织力量消灭秋蝻，以减少秋蝗扩散面积。对查残密度大，防治任务重和沿洪泽湖、淮河的脱水地区，更应严密注意。
    2、各地要精打细算，合理用药；大力发挥喷粉器械的作用，工具不足的地方，要推广布袋、麻袋、风箱等撒粉工具。有麦麸麦糠的地方，可以采用毒饵治蝗，既省工又省药。另外，还可用“狼毒”土农药掺“六六六”做毒饵治蝗，但是“狼毒”毒性大，必须注意安全。
    3、秋蝗机治面积大的地区，应该考虑建立固定机场、便利雨后仍能作业；要多设前进机场，减少空飞时间。充分发挥飞机防治潜力，没有机治任务的地区必须大力发动群众，作好一切准备，及时将秋蝗扑灭。
