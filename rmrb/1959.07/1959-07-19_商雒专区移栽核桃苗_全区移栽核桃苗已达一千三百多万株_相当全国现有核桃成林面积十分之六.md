    Shangluo Prefecture Transfers Walnut Seedlings
    More Than 13 Million Walnut Seedlings Have Been Transplanted Throughout the Prefecture
    Equivalent to 60% of the Existing Walnut Forest Area in the Country
    (Our dispatch) The people of Shangluo Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, known throughout the country for carrying out the "one sheng of walnuts per household" movement, have created new achievements in walnut planting this spring. More than 13 million walnut seedlings have been transplanted throughout the prefecture, a figure equivalent to about 60% of the country's existing walnut forest area.
    The Party and government leaders of Shangluo Prefecture, recognizing that cultivating walnuts and other economic forests is an effective way to prosper the mountainous economy, increase the production of edible oils, and increase the income of the people in the mountains, have consistently adhered to the working method of launching mass movements in recent years and have earnestly grasped this work. In 1957, the entire district launched the "one sheng of walnuts per household" movement, which achieved great results and greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses to build the mountainous areas. In 1958, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the "two sheng of walnuts per household" movement was launched. In the past two years, the entire district has planted more than 9,900 shi of walnuts and more than 55 million various other economic trees, resulting in 4,484 walnut gullies, 4,052 walnut slopes, 2,309 tung oil gullies, 2,000 tung oil slopes, 1,550 chestnut mountains, and 735 chestnut gullies. These trees are now generally growing well and have generally grown to five inches to one foot high.
    In order to consolidate these achievements and further promote the walnut planting movement, the Shangluo Prefectural Party Committee proposed the call to vigorously plant walnuts in this spring's afforestation, and decided to plant 19 million walnut trees and build more than 8,000 walnut gullies and walnut slopes throughout the district. Adhering to the spirit of comprehensive arrangement and overall consideration, they adopted the method of large-scale movements encompassing small-scale movements, long-term preparation, and short-term shock tactics, and rationally arranged the labor force.
    During the afforestation period, the prefectural Party and government leaders personally led more than 1,000 people, including cadres from the organs and representatives attending the socialist construction activists meeting of rural people's communes in the entire district, to plant more than 3,000 walnut trees on more than 200 mu of barren mountain slopes in Jiegeta Mountain near Chengguan, Shang County, which greatly encouraged the masses.
    In this year's walnut planting campaign, all parts of the district attached great importance to the quality of afforestation. All transplanted walnut seedlings were graded and classified to ensure planting and survival. At the same time, they also comprehensively inspected the growth of walnuts planted in the past few years.

    商雒专区移栽核桃苗
    全区移栽核桃苗已达一千三百多万株
    相当全国现有核桃成林面积十分之六
    本报讯　以开展一户种一升核桃运动闻名全国的陕西省商雒专区的人民，今年春天在栽种核桃方面又创造了新的成绩。全专区移栽核桃苗一千三百多万株，这个数字相当于全国现有核桃成林面积的60％左右。
    商雒专区党政领导由于认识到栽培核桃和其他经济林木是繁荣山区经济、增产食用油料和增加山区人民收入的有效办法，几年来一直坚持大搞群众运动的工作方法，将这项工作切实地抓了起来。1957年全区就开展了每户种一升核桃运动，获得了很大成绩，大大激发了群众建设山区的积极性。1958年根据省委的指示又开展了每户种二升核桃运动。两年来，全专区共栽种核桃九千九百多石、各种其它经济林木五千五百多万株，出现了核桃沟四千四百八十四条，核桃坡四千零五十二面，油桐沟二千三百零九条，油桐坡二千面，板栗山一千五百五十个、板栗沟七百三十五条。这些林木现在一般都生长良好，普遍长到五寸到一尺高。
    为了巩固这些成绩，把栽种核桃运动更加推进一步，中共商雒地委在今春造林中，提出大力栽种核桃的号召，决定在全区范围内栽种核桃一千九百万株、营造核桃沟、核桃坡八千多处，并本着全面安排，统筹兼顾的精神，采取大运动套小运动，长期准备、短期突击的办法，合理安排了劳力。
    造林期间，专区党政领导并亲自带领机关干部和参加全区农村人民公社社会主义建设积极分子会议的代表等一千多人，在商县城关附近芥圪塔山二百多亩荒山坡上栽植核桃三千多株，大大鼓舞了群众。
    在今年栽植核桃运动中，全区各地十分重视造林质量，移植的核桃苗全部分级分等，做到了保栽保活。同时，这里还全面检查了过去几年栽植的核桃的生长情况。
