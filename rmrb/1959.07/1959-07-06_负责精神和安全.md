    Responsible Spirit and Safety

    Whether each transportation department and each driver strictly implements the system and has a high degree of responsibility during transportation journeys will quickly be reflected in whether safe driving is possible.

    Some may not believe that safety issues are a reflection of mental state, but the facts from the Qinghe Motor Pool prove just that. In terms of conditions, the Qinghe Motor Pool is not considered good. Half of the vehicles are old cars from twenty years ago, and one-fifth of the drivers are new drivers, and the areas they drive in are mostly densely populated streets. However, they have driven safely for more than 13 million kilometers in three years without a single casualty accident. The only secret is that the leading cadres and drivers have a high sense of responsibility, which enables them to value safe transportation from thought to action.

    Some leading cadres and drivers in transportation departments have the view that being able to complete transportation tasks under conditions of rapidly increasing transportation volume, older vehicles, and more new drivers is already a great achievement, and that traffic accidents are inevitable. We believe that this argument is wrong. The more arduous the task and the worse the conditions, the more necessary it is to make every effort to prevent and avoid some possible accidents.

    Safe transportation is the most important task in the responsibilities of every transportation department and every driver. Any negligence will cause losses to the people and the country.

    负责精神和安全
    每个运输部门、每个司机，在运输行程中有没有严格执行制度和高度负责的精神，很快就会反映在行车上能不能安全。
    说安全问题是精神状态的反映，也许有人不信，然而清河车场的事实偏偏证明这一点。论条件，清河车场并不算好，有二分之一的汽车是二十年前的旧车，有五分之一的司机是新司机，行驶的地区大部分在人烟稠密的街道上。可是，他们三年来安全行车一千三百多万公里，没有一次伤亡事故，其中唯一的秘诀就是领导干部和司机具有高度负责精神，从而能够从思想到行动重视安全运输。
    有些运输部门的领导干部和司机，有一种看法，认为在运输量猛增、车子较旧、新司机多的情况下，能完成运输任务已是上上大吉，出点儿行车事故是难免的。我们认为这种论调是错误的，越是任务繁重，越是条件较差，越要千方百计，预为防止，免除一些可能发生的事故。
    安全运输，是每个运输部门每个司机职责中头等重要的大事，任何疏忽大意，就会给人民、给国家造成损失。
