This newspaper reports: The Shiyang People's Commune Party Committee in Huayang County, Sichuan Province, in the movement to strive for a greater autumn harvest, constantly strengthened political and ideological work in response to the ideological tendencies of the masses, further inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses and powerfully promoting production.

The Shiyang Commune has more than 17,000 mu of rice and more than 1,000 mu of corn and sweet potatoes. During the "Double Rush" (抢收抢种, harvesting and planting) campaign, due to the implementation of grasping early, grasping fast, grasping comprehensively, and applying sufficient fertilizer, crops generally grew well. At this time, complacency and slackness appeared in the minds of cadres and the masses. After the commune party committee discovered these ideas, it promptly conducted research and analysis, believing that the main reason was that some cadres and commune members did not have a sufficient understanding of the situation of continued great leaps forward in agricultural production this year, and had blindly optimistic sentiments about autumn production this year. It was decided to strengthen political and ideological education: on the one hand, it was to talk to the masses about the great significance of winning a bumper harvest this year; on the other hand, it was to mobilize the masses to conduct a general inspection of seedlings throughout the commune. During the inspection, it was found that some seedlings were not growing strongly, with third-class seedlings accounting for about 15%; some seedlings were withered and the tips of the leaves were yellow; the better-growing rice also had the risk of early lodging; in addition, there were more than 400 mu of fields that had not been fertilized, and generally they were not managed carefully. Through the vivid facts of on-site inspections in the fields, the cadres and commune members were greatly educated. They unanimously realized that planting rice seedlings in the fields was only 30% of the work, and 70% of the work had to be done in field management. Therefore, there must be no slackness. Cadres and the masses proactively examined their slackening thoughts. Many commune members wrote letters of determination and guarantee to the Party committee, vowing to devote themselves to field management.

After the field management was strengthened, some masses still doubted whether the planned targets for overall high yield could be achieved, fearing that the good seedlings would lodge, and fearing that there would not be enough fertilizer and labor. Therefore, the enthusiasm for field management was still insufficient. In response to these problems, the commune party committee also debated among cadres and the masses on "whether large-scale high yields can be achieved," "whether lodging can be prevented if the seedlings are good," and "whether the shortage of fertilizer and labor can be solved." During the debate, many commune members used accounting comparisons and personal experiences to illustrate that as long as everyone continues to boost their energy, these problems can be solved. For example, production team leader Dan Xinggen introduced the field management experience of the tenth production team in 1958 in achieving a large-scale rice yield of 1,002 jin per mu, especially summarizing the advanced deeds of commune member Xu Yongzhong, who worked hard and cleverly during the Red May battle, doing 67 workdays in a month, which greatly inspired everyone. Some people proposed and studied more than a dozen effective ways to prevent lodging in the debate, thereby strengthening the confidence of the masses, dispelling concerns, and firmly establishing the high-yield thinking of cadres and the masses.

In order to further stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses and make field management work more refined, the Party committee also paid great attention to propaganda and mobilization. Each management area adopted field propaganda signs, sending good news, sending congratulatory letters, big-character posters, evaluation platforms, honor rolls, merit badges, mobile red flags, and material rewards to commend good people and good deeds in large numbers, encourage the masses, and strive to be pacesetters. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses was even higher, setting off a competitive upsurge of catching up with each other. In the Dengta management area, during weeding, commune member Ji Shaoqing could weed more than 1.5 mu of fields every day. Everyone learned from Ji Shaoqing and caught up with Ji Shaoqing. Many commune members improved their work efficiency. For example, the bottom of the field in the ninth production team was hard and difficult to weed, and each person could only weed a little more than 0.5 mu of fields every day. However, under the impetus of Ji Shaoqing's high efficiency, each person increased to weeding more than 0.7 to 0.8 mu of fields every day.

    石羊公社党委怎样不断鼓舞群众前进？
    时时抓紧思想工作
    本报讯　四川省华阳县石羊人民公社党委，在争取秋季生产更大丰收的运动中，针对群众的思想倾向，不断加强政治思想工作，进一步鼓舞了群众干劲，有力地推动了生产。
    石羊公社有一万七千多亩水稻和一千多亩玉米、红苕。在“双抢”运动中由于贯彻了抓早、抓快、抓全面、施肥足，作物普遍生长良好。这时，在干部和群众中出现了自满松劲思想。公社党委发现这些思想以后，及时进行了研究分析，认为主要是一部分干部和社员对今年农业生产继续大跃进的形势认识不足，对今年秋季生产有盲目乐观情绪，决定加强政治思想教育：一方面向群众大讲夺取今年大丰收的重大意义；一方面发动群众在全社进行一次禾苗普遍检查。在检查中，发现少数秧苗生长并不健壮，三类苗约占15％左右，有的秧苗枯萎、叶尖发黄；生长较好的稻子也有早期倒伏的危险；另外还有四百多亩田没有施肥，一般都管理得不精细。通过田间现场检查的生动事实，大大教育了干部和社员，他们一致认识到水稻栽下田，只不过是完成了30％的活路，还有70％的活路要在田间管理中去做，因此绝不能有丝毫松劲情绪。干部和群众主动的检查了松劲思想，很多社员纷纷向党委写了决心书、保证书，要全力投入田间管理。
    在田间管理加强以后，由于部分群众对是否能实现全面高产的计划指标仍有怀疑，怕秧子好了要倒伏，怕肥料、劳力不够用，因而对田间管理的劲头仍然不足。公社党委针对这些问题，又在干部和群众中辩论了“能不能大面积高产”、“秧子好了要倒伏能不能防止”、“肥料、劳动力不够能不能解决”等问题。在辩论中，许多社员用算账对比和现身说法的事实，说明只要大家不断地鼓足干劲，这些问题都可以解决。如生产队长但星根在辩论中介绍了第十生产队1958年获得水稻大面积亩产一千零二斤的田间管理经验，特别是总结了社员徐永中在大战红五月中苦干加巧干，一个月做了六十七个劳动日的先进事迹，对大家启发很大。有的在辩论中提出和研究了十余种防止秧子倒伏的有效办法，从而坚定了群众的信心，破除了顾虑，干部和群众的高产思想牢固地树立起来了。
    为了进一步发挥群众的积极性，把田间管理工作做得更为精细，党委还十分注意宣传鼓动工作。各个管理区都采取了田间鼓动牌、送喜报、送贺信、大字报、评比台、光荣榜、记功牌、流动红旗、以及物质奖励等方式，大量表扬好人好事，鼓舞群众，争取当标兵，因而群众的积极性更高，掀起了一个你追我赶的竞赛热潮。灯塔管理区在薅秧中，社员吉少清每天能薅一亩五分多田，大家学吉少清、赶吉少清，不少的社员都提高了工效，如第九生产队田底子硬、不好薅秧，每天每人只薅五分多田。但在吉少清高工效的带动下，每天每人提高到薅七分至八分多田。
