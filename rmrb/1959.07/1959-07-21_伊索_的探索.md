Exploring "Aesop"
    Feng Zi

    The Brazilian play "Aesop" depicts the slave Aesop using his extraordinary wisdom to create thought-provoking fables. His fables are used by the slave-owning philosopher Gerson to swindle more money and higher status, and his fables rescue the philosopher from the brink of ruin caused by drunken ranting. For the slave Aesop, fables are his weapon to fight for freedom. No matter how despicable the slave owners and priests are in their conspiracies and plots against him, in order to defend human dignity and freedom, and to break free from the shackles of slavery, in the dark slave society, facing the "law," Aesop chooses the path of rather dying for freedom than living as a slave. Aesop's death is a philosophical fable written by the Brazilian writer Guilherme Figueiredo, set against the background of slave society more than two thousand years ago, using the past to satirize the present to convey the voice of the Latin American people, reflect the fighting will of the Latin American people, and powerfully warn the US imperialists: "Everyone is mature enough to gain freedom, and can die for it if necessary!" Those who want freedom are not afraid of death. The Latin American people's struggle for the right to survival and for a free human life is igniting the flames of resistance against imperialist aggression in the "backyard" of the United States! The Latin American people have already learned how to treat the "cursed 'slave' system."
    This play attracts people not only because of its positive theme, but mainly because it portrays six different types of typical characters. The characters are very rich, and the conflicts between the characters lead to dramatic contradictions, sometimes as natural as a stream flowing, and sometimes as shocking as a storm. Reading the script and watching the performance again and again, I am inspired more and more each time. It is like a treasure mountain, a treasure mountain of human wisdom. Every scene, every plot, every line is worth chewing on, savoring, and pondering again and again. For two thousand years, human society has transitioned from the slave system to the capitalist system and the socialist system. However, for the two-thirds of the world's population living in capitalist societies, the relationship between people may be no better than in slave society. The cursed thing is that social system! The playwright, through Aesop's mouth, reveals the essence of the evils of class society. In class society, not all unfree slaves are aware of the preciousness of freedom. Like the female slave Melita, she is a slave, and she is a woman. While she dreams of freedom, she dreams even more of love and a happy life. She envies Clea's status, and her dream of being a philosopher's wife is stronger than her desire to be a free person. Like Abyssinia, he should be a fierce beast in the mountains, but he has been tamed into a domestic animal of the slave owner. He does not receive human treatment, he is accustomed to obeying his master, and he is indifferent when he whips the slave Aesop. The tragedy of the fate of slaves lies in losing the desire to be a free person, and losing the basic class consciousness. In contrast, Aesop's image appears noble and great. Aesop hates the hypocrisy, meanness, greed, and stupidity of the slave owner Gerson, hates the slave owner's watchdog, the chief guard. Aesop has pity and sympathy for Melita, and even forgives Abyssinia. Aesop patiently educates and enlightens Melita. Does Melita finally awaken? This is a question that the author intentionally leaves for the readers and audience to ponder.
    The relationship between Aesop and Clea is complex and subtle. Clea is a free person, the philosopher's wife. As the wife of a slave owner, in a sense, she is just another piece of property of the slave owner, like the house and the other female slaves. Clea understands her position and understands her husband. She does not love that foolish and cunning husband, and she dreams of falling in love with someone with brains. She once pinned her hopes on the chief guard, but Aesop's intelligence and wisdom captured the heart of this woman who longed for true love, and she fell madly in love with this ugly, deformed man. She was rejected, and her pride made her think of revenge. However, when Aesop is framed and must be executed according to the priests' law, she steps forward to take Aesop's place in accepting the death penalty. The development of Clea's character and thoughts is so tortuous, and the inner world of the character is so rich. The class consciousness given to her by her own class, and the rebellious nature of her female instinct subordinate to men, these two are contradictory but unified in her, and the very dramatic plot also develops reasonably. Clea's pursuit of Aesop is a subplot in the story, but this subplot plays a powerful role in promoting the development of the theme of Aesop's struggle for freedom, thereby enriching the struggle significance of the theme.
    Using historical themes to satirize today's capitalist social system, so-called using the past to serve the present, requires more from the author. In terms of creative methods, the play "Aesop" is an excellent work with strong realism and ideal colors. Aesop's way of fighting for freedom reflects the historical characteristics of slave society, and the spirit created by the playwright of rather dying than not being free, not only reflects the fighting will of the slaves in slave society, but also reflects the fighting spirit and will of all oppressed people in class society. This is the realistic basis for the play Aesop's use of the past to serve the present in terms of creative methods. We feel so close to the thoughts and feelings of people more than two thousand years ago, and even feel resonance, and the reason lies here. That philosophical, poetic language boldly reveals the depths of the human soul in class society, and also brings us many thought-provoking questions! For performing artists, how many subtexts are waiting to be excavated! Language paints the script with a distinct romantic color, and language brings readers and audiences a high degree of aesthetic enjoyment. Romanticism is also reflected in the plot and structure. The plot and structure serve the theme of the play, and the theme is embodied through the actions of people. Take Aesop, for example, the creation of this character is both realistic and romantic. Similarly, the character of Clea is also romanticized by the writer on a realistic basis.
    The Beijing People's Art Theatre has done a very meaningful work. The performance of "Aesop" has played a good role in cultural exchanges between China and Brazil. The Chinese people, who care about the anti-imperialist struggle of the Latin American people, are not only interested in appreciating famous plays, but more importantly, through the performance of famous plays, they further understand the fighting will of the Brazilian people.
    Young female director Chen Yong showed her talent and artistic organizational ability in the overall artistic treatment. Removing the curtain allows the audience to experience the imagined ancient theater, and the actors' every physical movement showcases the beauty of ancient Greek human sculptures. These are by no means for sensationalism, but to enable the audience to enter the play faster after entering the theater, and it has obviously achieved its due effect.
    Of the six characters, only five speak, and there are three veteran actors. Shu Xiuwen, Fang Guande, and Lü En playing Clea, Gerson, and Melita should be easy to handle. This is a good play for the actors to enjoy, but it is not easy to perform, because the inner movements of the characters that can be excavated are too rich. It is not easy to achieve the current results after the entire play was rehearsed in a short period of time. Actors will definitely have new experiences and new discoveries after performing for a period of time, which will inevitably better enrich the creation of the character's image. This is a good play that can provide actors with training opportunities. The so-called enjoyment means this. Therefore, I hope the theater will send more actors to practice rehearsing, and it may be a good idea to send multiple actors for each role. How should each role be created is also a topic worthy of research. For example, that silent slave Abyssinia, he does not speak, but it is not introduced that he is a mute. Why doesn't he speak? From Aesop's lines, we know that Abyssinia has excellently completed the slave owner's orders and whipped Aesop. Aesop does not like him. In Aesop's eyes, Abyssinia is not as good as a beast, because Abyssinia has been tamed and become the master's tool. The script provides some clues for studying the character. How should we understand, handle, and create this character? Abyssinia has no lines, but that does not mean he is a mute. His actions convey his thoughts. Slaves should sympathize with slaves, but there are also slaves who only know how to obey their masters. Aesop's spirit of rather dying for freedom must have inspired the enslaved slaves, including Abyssinia, but Abyssinia is not an easily influenced slave. The slave system corrodes people's hearts, and its tragedy and hatred lie here. The Abyssinia in the current performance seems to be aware of this too early. At the end of the second act, after Gerson uses rogue tactics to forcibly extract clever methods from Aesop to cope with his predicament, he finally orders Abyssinia to whip Aesop. Abyssinia raises the whip and immediately puts it down weakly. This treatment obviously wants to show that Abyssinia cannot bear to whip his own people, and the intention of the performance is obviously to strive for sympathy for Abyssinia. Perhaps some people sympathize, but this sympathy is not moving enough. If Abyssinia's whip really hit Aesop's body, it might make more people feel pain in their hearts, more deeply hate the slave owner, more deeply expose the cruelty of the slave system, and more deeply convey the author's allegory of using the past to satirize the present. This raising of the whip has endless potential significance. Even if it is a symbolic raising, the whip does not have to fall on Aesop, and the effect of that kind of treatment should be different.
    The issue of Aesop's image is also worth studying. In the play, women are afraid of Aesop because he is ugly. How to understand the word "ugly" and how to create this ugly image requires multi-faceted exploration. The ugliness of the image contrasts with the beauty of the soul, and this beauty will make people feel more noble and respectable. Clea's journey from hating him to loving him specifically illustrates this point. His ugliness symbolizes the trauma suffered by the slave class and should not be understood as a general physiological deformity. So how should the character's image be shaped? The Aesop on the stage now is more handsome than the chief guard. Why did Clea give up pursuing the chief guard and fall in love with Aesop? Will this cause unnecessary illusions?
    Aesop's love for Clea is not unmoved, but he rejects Clea for the sake of lofty ideals. In the scene where Clea asks Aesop for love in the second act, Aesop has an inner struggle when he rejects Clea. The current treatment seems to only emphasize the rejection aspect. In the third act, when Aesop receives the deed to restore his freedom, he hands it to Clea and says: "Take it, Clea, either you let me go, or you tie me up." This action is not understood by all the audience, perhaps because of this.
    For centuries, people have been inspired and encouraged by "Aesop's Fables" in their long journey of life, from learning to walk to fighting bravely. The play "Aesop" further inspires and encourages oppressed people to move towards the path of truth. In the theatrical stage and in artistic creation, the play "Aesop" leaves many questions worthy of exploration. The performance of "Aesop" has aroused great interest among artists. Loving beautiful things is human nature. To comprehensively and deeply study the script of "Aesop" and the artistic creation of the stage image is beyond my ability, so I try to write "Exploring 'Aesop'."

    “伊索”的探索
    凤子
    巴西名剧“伊索”，写奴隶伊索以他无比的智慧编说了发人深省的寓言，他的寓言被奴隶主哲学家格桑用来骗取更多的金钱和更高的名誉地位，他的寓言挽救了哲学家因醉后狂言几乎要陷进的毁灭的绝境。对奴隶伊索说来，寓言是他争取自由的武器，不管奴隶主和祭司们多么卑鄙地阴谋陷害他，为了维护人的尊严和自由，为了挣脱奴隶的枷锁，在黑暗的奴隶制度社会里，面对着“法律”，伊索选择了宁为自由死，不为奴隶生的道路。伊索的死是巴西作家吉里耶尔美·菲格莱德编写的一个富有哲理意义的寓言，以两千多年前奴隶社会为背景，借古喻今地传达出了拉丁美洲人民的声音，反映出了拉丁美洲人民的斗争意志，并且有力地警告了美帝国主义分子：“无论那一个人都成熟得可以得到自由了，而且只要是需要的话，就能为它而死去！”要自由的人是不怕死的，拉丁美洲人民争取生存的权利，争取人的自由生活，正在美国“后院”燃起了反抗帝国主义侵略的怒火！拉丁美洲人民已经懂得应该怎样对待“该诅咒的‘奴隶’制度”了。
    这个剧本吸引着人们不只是因为有了积极意义的主题，主要是它写出了六个不同类型的典型人物。人物性格是非常丰富的，人物之间性格的冲突导致戏剧性的矛盾，有时像溪间流水那样自然，有时又像暴风骤雨那样的震撼人心。一次再次的读着剧本，观看演出，一次比一次受到更多的启发。它像是一座宝山，是人类智慧的宝山，它的每一段戏，每一情节，每一段台词，值得人一再咀嚼，一再回味，一再深思。两千年来，人类社会已从奴隶制度进入到资本主义制度和社会主义制度，可是生活在资本主义制度社会里的占全世界三分之二人口的人民，人与人之间的关系，其实质同奴隶制度社会也许过之无不及吧。该诅咒的是那个社会制度！剧作者借伊索的口说出了阶级社会罪恶的实质。在阶级社会里不自由的奴隶也并不是人人觉悟到自由的可贵的。像女奴隶梅丽塔，她是个奴隶，她是个女人。在她幻想得到自由的同时，她更幻想得到爱情和幸福的生活。她羡慕克列娅的地位，她幻想作为哲学家的妻子较之作一个自由人的愿望更强烈。像阿比西尼亚，他应该是山上的猛兽，可是他被驯服的成为奴隶主的家畜。他得不到人的待遇，他习惯了听命主人，他鞭打奴隶伊索时是木然无动于衷的。奴隶命运的可悲，就在于失去了做一个自由人的想望，失去了起码的阶级自觉。对照之下，伊索的形象就显得崇高和伟大了。伊索憎恶虚伪、卑鄙、贪婪、愚蠢的奴隶主格桑，憎恶奴隶主的看家狗守卫队长，伊索对梅丽塔是怜悯和同情的，甚至对阿比西尼亚也是原谅的。伊索耐心的教育启发梅丽塔，梅丽塔到底觉悟了没有呢？这是作者有意留给读者和观众思索的问题。
    伊索和克列娅的关系是复杂的，微妙的。克列娅是自由人，是哲学家的妻子，作为一个奴隶主的妻子，在某种意义来看，她不过是像房子和其他女奴隶一样是奴隶主的一分财产而已。克列娅明白自己的地位，也了解自己的丈夫。她不爱那个愚蠢而狡猾的丈夫，她幻想能爱上一个有头脑的人。她曾经把幻想寄托给守卫队长，可是伊索的聪明智慧夺去了这个渴望得到真正爱情的女人的心，她疯狂地爱上了这个丑陋的畸形的人。她遭到拒绝，自尊心使她想到报复，可是当伊索遭到陷害按祭司的法律必须处死的时候，她挺身出来要替代伊索接受死的处分。克列娅这个人物的性格和思想的发展是如此的曲折，人物内心世界是如此的丰富，本阶级赋给她的阶级意识，和她的从属于男人的女性本能的反抗性，这两者是矛盾的却统一在她的身上，非常富于戏剧性的情节也得到合理的发展。克列娅追求伊索就剧情来说是一条副线，可是这条副线对伊索争取自由这一主题的发展却起到有力的推动作用，从而也丰富了主题的斗争意义。
    取历史题材来讽喻今天的资本主义社会制度，所谓古为今用，要求于作者的也就更多些，就创作方法来说，剧本“伊索”是一部现实主义很强和富有理想色彩的优秀作品。奴隶伊索争取自由斗争的方式反映了奴隶社会的历史特点，而剧作者创造的宁死也要争取做个自由人的这种精神，不仅反映了奴隶社会奴隶的斗争意志，也反映了阶级社会一切被压迫的人民的斗争精神和意志，这就是剧本伊索在创作方法上古为今用的现实基础。两千多年前人物的思想感情我们感到如此的亲切，甚至被引起共鸣，原因也在此。那富有哲理的诗一般的语言，既大胆的揭露了阶级社会人的灵魂深处，也带给我们不少值得深思的问题！对表演艺术家来说，多少潜台词等待着挖掘呵！语言为剧本涂上了鲜明的浪漫主义的色彩，语言带给读者和观众高度的美的享受。浪漫主义也表现在情节和结构方面。情节、结构服从于戏的主题，主题则是通过人的行动来体现的。就说伊索吧，这个人物的创造是现实主义的也是浪漫主义的，同样，克列娅这个人物也是在现实基础上作家给以浪漫主义化了的。
    北京人民艺术剧院做了一件非常有意义的工作，“伊索”的上演对中巴文化交流起了很好的作用，关心拉丁美洲人民反帝斗争的中国人民，不止是有兴趣欣赏到名剧，重要的是通过名剧的演出进一步了解到巴西人民的斗争意志。
    青年女导演陈颙在总的艺术处理上显示了她的才华和艺术组织的能力。取消幕布，使观众体验到想像中的古代剧场，演员的每一形体动作展示了古希腊人体雕像的美，这些决不是为了猎奇，是为了使观众进入剧场后能够较快的进入戏里，显然已收到它应有的效果。
    六个角色只有五个是开口的，并且有三个老演员，舒绣文、方琯德、吕恩饰演克列娅、格桑和梅丽塔应该是得心应手的。这是演员过瘾的好戏，但却不是好演的戏，因为人物内心可挖掘的动作太丰富了。整台戏在短短的时间里排演出来，有现在的成绩是不易的。演一个时期演员一定会有新的体验，新的发现，从而也必然会更好的丰富角色的形象创造。这是一出可以使演员得到锻炼机会的好戏，所谓过瘾，意即在此。因此希望剧院多派演员来练习排练，每一角色不妨多派几个演员。每个角色究竟应该怎样来创造，也是值得研究的课题。比如那个不说话的奴隶阿比西尼亚吧，他不说话，可也未介绍他是哑叭。为什么不说话呢？从伊索的台词里，我们知道阿比西尼亚曾出色地完成了奴隶主的命令，鞭打过伊索，伊索不喜欢他，在伊索眼里阿比西尼亚是野兽也不如的家畜，因为阿比西尼亚已被驯服成为主人的工具。剧本提供了这样一些研究人物的线索，我们应该怎样来理解、来处理、来创造这个人物呢？阿比西尼亚没有台词，但不等于他是哑叭，他的行动就在传达他的思想。奴隶应该是同情奴隶的，但奴隶也有只知听命于主人的。伊索宁为自由死的精神必然感召了被奴役的奴隶们，也包括阿比西尼亚，但阿比西尼亚并不是容易受感化的奴隶，奴隶制度腐蚀了人的心灵，其可悲可恨也在此。现在演出中的阿比西尼亚觉悟的似乎过早了些；第二幕结尾，格桑用无赖手法从伊索那里强讨来了聪明办法去应付自己的困境之后，终于命令阿比西尼亚鞭打伊索，阿比西尼亚举起鞭子马上又无力的放下了鞭子，这一处理显然在说明阿比西尼亚不忍再鞭打自己人，演出的意图显然想争取对阿比西尼亚的同情。也许有人同情，可是这同情是不够动心的。如果阿比西尼亚的鞭子真的一鞭打到伊索的身上，也许会使更多的人从心里痛出来，会更深的憎恨奴隶主，更深的揭露了奴隶制度的残酷，也更深的传达出作者以古喻今的寓意。这一举鞭有它无尽的潜在意义，即使是象征性的一举，鞭子不必落在伊索身上，那样的处理效果应有所不同吧。
    伊索的形象问题也是值得研究的。剧中女人都害怕伊索，因为他丑。如何理解这个丑字，如何创造这个丑的形象是需要多方探索的。形象的丑对照心灵的美，这个美会更使人感到崇高和可敬的。克列娅从讨厌他到爱他就具体说明了这一点。他的丑象征奴隶阶级所受的创伤，不应理解为一般生理上的畸形。那么人物形象应如何塑造呢？现在舞台上的伊索其英俊超过守卫队长，克列娅为什么放弃了追求守卫队长而爱上了伊索，这里是否会使人产生不必要的错觉？
    伊索对克列娅的爱情不是不受感动的，而是为了崇高的理想才拒绝了克列娅。第二幕克列娅向伊索求爱的一场戏，伊索拒绝克列娅是有一番内心斗争的。现在的处理似乎只强调拒绝的一面。第三幕伊索拿到恢复自由人的契书时却又递给克列娅说：“拿去，克列娅，或者是你放走我，或者是你捆住我”。这一行动不被所有的观众理解，原因也许在此。
    多少个世纪以来，人们在漫长的人生道路上从学步到勇敢地斗争下去，“伊索寓言”起到一定的启发、鼓舞作用。剧本“伊索”更启发鼓舞了被压迫的人民走向真理的道路。在戏剧舞台上，艺术创作中，剧本“伊索”留下了许多值得探索的问题。“伊索”演出引起艺术家们热烈的兴趣，爱美好的事物是人的天性，要全面深入的研究“伊索”的剧本和舞台形象的艺术创造，非我力所能及，故试写“伊索”的探索。
