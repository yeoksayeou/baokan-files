Exploring "Aesop"
    Feng Zi

    The Brazilian play "Aesop" depicts the slave Aesop using his extraordinary wisdom to create thought-provoking fables. His fables are used by the slave-owning philosopher Gerson to swindle more money and higher status, and his fables rescue the philosopher from the brink of ruin caused by drunken ranting. For the slave Aesop, fables are his weapon to fight for freedom. No matter how despicable the slave owners and priests are in their conspiracies and plots against him, in order to defend human dignity and freedom, and to break free from the shackles of slavery, in the dark slave society, facing the "law," Aesop chooses the path of rather dying for freedom than living as a slave. Aesop's death is a philosophical fable written by the Brazilian writer Guilherme Figueiredo, set against the background of slave society more than two thousand years ago, using the past to satirize the present to convey the voice of the Latin American people, reflect the fighting will of the Latin American people, and powerfully warn the US imperialists: "Everyone is mature enough to gain freedom, and can die for it if necessary!" Those who want freedom are not afraid of death. The Latin American people's struggle for the right to survival and for a free human life is igniting the flames of resistance against imperialist aggression in the "backyard" of the United States! The Latin American people have already learned how to treat the "cursed 'slave' system."
    This play attracts people not only because of its positive theme, but mainly because it portrays six different types of typical characters. The characters are very rich, and the conflicts between the characters lead to dramatic contradictions, sometimes as natural as a stream flowing, and sometimes as shocking as a storm. Reading the script and watching the performance again and again, I am inspired more and more each time. It is like a treasure mountain, a treasure mountain of human wisdom. Every scene, every plot, every line is worth chewing on, savoring, and pondering again and again. For two thousand years, human society has transitioned from the slave system to the capitalist system and the socialist system. However, for the two-thirds of the world's population living in capitalist societies, the relationship between people may be no better than in slave society. The cursed thing is that social system! The playwright, through Aesop's mouth, reveals the essence of the evils of class society. In class society, not all unfree slaves are aware of the preciousness of freedom. Like the female slave Melita, she is a slave, and she is a woman. While she dreams of freedom, she dreams even more of love and a happy life. She envies Clea's status, and her dream of being a philosopher's wife is stronger than her desire to be a free person. Like Abyssinia, he should be a fierce beast in the mountains, but he has been tamed into a domestic animal of the slave owner. He does not receive human treatment, he is accustomed to obeying his master, and he is indifferent when he whips the slave Aesop. The tragedy of the fate of slaves lies in losing the desire to be a free person, and losing the basic class consciousness. In contrast, Aesop's image appears noble and great. Aesop hates the hypocrisy, meanness, greed, and stupidity of the slave owner Gerson, hates the slave owner's watchdog, the chief guard. Aesop has pity and sympathy for Melita, and even forgives Abyssinia. Aesop patiently educates and enlightens Melita. Does Melita finally awaken? This is a question that the author intentionally leaves for the readers and audience to ponder.
    The relationship between Aesop and Clea is complex and subtle. Clea is a free person, the philosopher's wife. As the wife of a slave owner, in a sense, she is just another piece of property of the slave owner, like the house and the other female slaves. Clea understands her position and understands her husband. She does not love that foolish and cunning husband, and she dreams of falling in love with someone with brains. She once pinned her hopes on the chief guard, but Aesop's intelligence and wisdom captured the heart of this woman who longed for true love, and she fell madly in love with this ugly, deformed man. She was rejected, and her pride made her think of revenge. However, when Aesop is framed and must be executed according to the priests' law, she steps forward to take Aesop's place in accepting the death penalty. The development of Clea's character and thoughts is so tortuous, and the inner world of the character is so rich. The class consciousness given to her by her own class, and the rebellious nature of her female instinct subordinate to men, these two are contradictory but unified in her, and the very dramatic plot also develops reasonably. Clea's pursuit of Aesop is a subplot in the story, but this subplot plays a powerful role in promoting the development of the theme of Aesop's struggle for freedom, thereby enriching the struggle significance of the theme.
    Using historical themes to satirize today's capitalist social system, so-called using the past to serve the present, requires more from the author. In terms of creative methods, the play "Aesop" is an excellent work with strong realism and ideal colors. Aesop's way of fighting for freedom reflects the historical characteristics of slave society, and the spirit created by the playwright of rather dying than not being free, not only reflects the fighting will of the slaves in slave society, but also reflects the fighting spirit and will of all oppressed people in class society. This is the realistic basis for the play Aesop's use of the past to serve the present in terms of creative methods. We feel so close to the thoughts and feelings of people more than two thousand years ago, and even feel resonance, and the reason lies here. That philosophical, poetic language boldly reveals the depths of the human soul in class society, and also brings us many thought-provoking questions! For performing artists, how many subtexts are waiting to be excavated! Language paints the script with a distinct romantic color, and language brings readers and audiences a high degree of aesthetic enjoyment. Romanticism is also reflected in the plot and structure. The plot and structure serve the theme of the play, and the theme is embodied through the actions of people. Take Aesop, for example, the creation of this character is both realistic and romantic. Similarly, the character of Clea is also romanticized by the writer on a realistic basis.
    The Beijing People's Art Theatre has done a very meaningful work. The performance of "Aesop" has played a good role in cultural exchanges between China and Brazil. The Chinese people, who care about the anti-imperialist struggle of the Latin American people, are not only interested in appreciating famous plays, but more importantly, through the performance of famous plays, they further understand the fighting will of the Brazilian people.
    Young female director Chen Yong showed her talent and artistic organizational ability in the overall artistic treatment. Removing the curtain allows the audience to experience the imagined ancient theater, and the actors' every physical movement showcases the beauty of ancient Greek human sculptures. These are by no means for sensationalism, but to enable the audience to enter the play faster after entering the theater, and it has obviously achieved its due effect.
    Of the six characters, only five speak, and there are three veteran actors. Shu Xiuwen, Fang Guande, and LÃ¼ En playing Clea, Gerson, and Melita should be easy to handle. This is a good play for the actors to enjoy, but it is not easy to perform, because the inner movements of the characters that can be excavated are too rich. It is not easy to achieve the current results after the entire play was rehearsed in a short period of time. Actors will definitely have new experiences and new discoveries after performing for a period of time, which will inevitably better enrich the creation of the character's image. This is a good play that can provide actors with training opportunities. The so-called enjoyment means this. Therefore, I hope the theater will send more actors to practice rehearsing, and it may be a good idea to send multiple actors for each role. How should each role be created is also a topic worthy of research. For example, that silent slave Abyssinia, he does not speak, but it is not introduced that he is a mute. Why doesn't he speak? From Aesop's lines, we know that Abyssinia has excellently completed the slave owner's orders and whipped Aesop. Aesop does not like him. In Aesop's eyes, Abyssinia is not as good as a beast, because Abyssinia has been tamed and become the master's tool. The script provides some clues for studying the character. How should we understand, handle, and create this character? Abyssinia has no lines, but that does not mean he is a mute. His actions convey his thoughts. Slaves should sympathize with slaves, but there are also slaves who only know how to obey their masters. Aesop's spirit of rather dying for freedom must have inspired the enslaved slaves, including Abyssinia, but Abyssinia is not an easily influenced slave. The slave system corrodes people's hearts, and its tragedy and hatred lie here. The Abyssinia in the current performance seems to be aware of this too early. At the end of the second act, after Gerson uses rogue tactics to forcibly extract clever methods from Aesop to cope with his predicament, he finally orders Abyssinia to whip Aesop. Abyssinia raises the whip and immediately puts it down weakly. This treatment obviously wants to show that Abyssinia cannot bear to whip his own people, and the intention of the performance is obviously to strive for sympathy for Abyssinia. Perhaps some people sympathize, but this sympathy is not moving enough. If Abyssinia's whip really hit Aesop's body, it might make more people feel pain in their hearts, more deeply hate the slave owner, more deeply expose the cruelty of the slave system, and more deeply convey the author's allegory of using the past to satirize the present. This raising of the whip has endless potential significance. Even if it is a symbolic raising, the whip does not have to fall on Aesop, and the effect of that kind of treatment should be different.
    The issue of Aesop's image is also worth studying. In the play, women are afraid of Aesop because he is ugly. How to understand the word "ugly" and how to create this ugly image requires multi-faceted exploration. The ugliness of the image contrasts with the beauty of the soul, and this beauty will make people feel more noble and respectable. Clea's journey from hating him to loving him specifically illustrates this point. His ugliness symbolizes the trauma suffered by the slave class and should not be understood as a general physiological deformity. So how should the character's image be shaped? The Aesop on the stage now is more handsome than the chief guard. Why did Clea give up pursuing the chief guard and fall in love with Aesop? Will this cause unnecessary illusions?
    Aesop's love for Clea is not unmoved, but he rejects Clea for the sake of lofty ideals. In the scene where Clea asks Aesop for love in the second act, Aesop has an inner struggle when he rejects Clea. The current treatment seems to only emphasize the rejection aspect. In the third act, when Aesop receives the deed to restore his freedom, he hands it to Clea and says: "Take it, Clea, either you let me go, or you tie me up." This action is not understood by all the audience, perhaps because of this.
    For centuries, people have been inspired and encouraged by "Aesop's Fables" in their long journey of life, from learning to walk to fighting bravely. The play "Aesop" further inspires and encourages oppressed people to move towards the path of truth. In the theatrical stage and in artistic creation, the play "Aesop" leaves many questions worthy of exploration. The performance of "Aesop" has aroused great interest among artists. Loving beautiful things is human nature. To comprehensively and deeply study the script of "Aesop" and the artistic creation of the stage image is beyond my ability, so I try to write "Exploring 'Aesop'."
