    This newspaper reports that under the leadership of the Party, workers in the national machinery industry extensively carried out the movement to increase production and practice economy, achieving great results in the first half of the year. The total production value doubled compared to the same period last year.
    Among the twenty-five major products, the total output of thirteen major products, including metallurgical equipment, power station equipment, AC motors, transformers, electrical wires and cables, power machinery, water pumps, blowers, metal cutting machine tools, forging equipment, combine harvesters, industrial bearings, and barges, all completed more than 50% of the annual plan. Compared with the same period last year, power station equipment increased by 3.08 times; AC motors increased by 2.18 times; transformers increased by 1.56 times; and metal cutting machine tools (excluding simple machine tools) increased by 68%.
    Among the above major products, the total actual output completed in the first half of this year accounted for more than 70% of the total actual output completed in the entire year last year for six major categories: mining equipment, power station equipment, AC motors, transformers, electrical wires and cables, and power machinery.  It was between 50% and 70% of the total actual output completed last year for four categories: metallurgical equipment, industrial bearings, metal cutting machine tools, and water pumps. Compared with the same period last year, the production in the first half of this year had a great leap forward compared to the same period last year.
    The above achievements are mainly due to the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of policies of walking on two legs, the full play of the spirit of hard work, practical work, and clever work by all employees, and the vigorous development of technological innovation and technological revolution. Among the main products, mining equipment in the second quarter completed 113% of the plan for April to July, metallurgical equipment completed 111% of the plan for April to July, agricultural power machinery for irrigation and drainage completed 106% of the plan for April to July, and combine harvesters completed 107% of the plan for April to July.
    In the second quarter, while output increased, factories also focused on improving quality and have already seen initial results. Factories have taken concrete measures, launched a mass movement to rectify production order and improve product quality, strengthened technical inspections, and taken measures to solve key technical problems in production. Some enterprises have conducted thorough inspections and appraisals of products that have been produced in the past, and have restored or experimentally modified product structures that should not have been simplified and materials that were improperly substituted. For example, the quality of grinding machines produced by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in March was very poor. After mobilizing the masses to conduct a major quality inspection, and studying and taking concrete measures, the quality of grinding machines produced in May has improved. The scrap rate of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory in the first half of June decreased by 5.33% compared with the same period in May. The quality of motors produced by factories such as Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory and Dalian Electric Machinery Factory has also improved.
    In the process of completing tasks in the first half of the year, there are still some problems in the production and management of the machinery industry. For example, the completeness of sets is insufficient, the supply of materials is insufficient and the variety is incomplete, the internal production and technical order of enterprises is not normal enough, and the quality of some products is not good enough, etc. The leadership departments and enterprises of the machinery industry are organizing forces and taking measures to gradually solve these problems, laying the foundation for completing and overfulfilling the production tasks in the second half of the year and for the continued leap forward of the machinery industry.

    全国机械工业上半年生产成绩显著
    十三类主要产品超额完成计划　生产总值比去年同期成倍增长
    本报讯　全国机械工业职工，在党的领导下，广泛开展了增产节约运动，上半年取得了巨大成绩。生产总值比去年同期成倍增长。
    在二十五类主要产品中，冶金设备、电站设备、交流电动机、变压器、电线电缆、动力机械、水泵、鼓风机、金属切削机床、锻压设备、联合收割机、工业用轴承和驳船等十三类主要产品的总产量都完成了年计划的50％以上。和去年同期比较，电站设备增长了三点零八倍；交流电动机增长了二点一八倍；变压器增长了一点五六倍；金属切削机床（不包括简易机床）增长了68％。
    在以上主要产品中，今年上半年实际完成的总产量为去年全年实际完成总产量的70％以上的有：矿山设备、电站设备、交流电动机、变压器、电线电缆、动力机械等六大类；为去年实际完成总产量50％至70％的有：冶金设备、工业用轴承、金属切削机床、水泵等四类。与去年同期比较：今年上半年的生产比去年同期有很大的跃进。
    取得以上成绩，主要是由于贯彻了党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套的两条腿走路的方针，全体职工充分发挥了苦干实干与巧干的精神，大闹技术革新和技术革命。主要产品中，矿山设备在二季度就完成了4至7月份计划的113％，冶金设备完成了4至7月份计划的111％，农业排灌用动力机械完成了4—7月份计划的106％，联合收割机完成了4—7月份计划的107％。
    二季度中，在产量上升的同时，各工厂还着重地抓了提高质量，并且已经收到初步效果。各厂采取了具体措施，掀起了整顿生产秩序、提高产品质量的群众运动，加强了技术检查，采取措施解决生产中的关键技术问题。有些企业对于过去已经生产出来的产品进行了彻底的检查和鉴定，该返修的返修，把过去不应该简化的产品结构和代用不当的材料都分别恢复或试验修改。例如上海机床厂3月份生产的磨床质量很差，发动群众展开质量大检查，研究和采取了具体措施以后，5月份生产的磨床质量已经有所提高。太原矿山机器厂6月份上半月的废品率比5月份同期降低了5.33％。湘潭电机厂和大连电机厂等厂出产的电机质量都有所提高。
    在上半年完成任务的过程中，机械工业的生产和管理上也还存在着一些问题。例如成套性不够，材料供应不足、品种不齐，企业内部生产技术秩序不够正常，某些产品的质量不够好等等。对这些问题，机械工业的各级领导部门和企业正在组织力量，采取措施，使之逐步得到解决，为完成和超额完成下半年的生产任务，为机械工业的继续跃进，奠定基础。
