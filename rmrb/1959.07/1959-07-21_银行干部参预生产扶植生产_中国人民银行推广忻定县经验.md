Bank Cadres Participate in Production to Support Construction
The People's Bank of China Promotes the Experience of Xinding County
    (Our newspaper Taiyuan, July 20th) The Xinding County Branch of the People's Bank of China in Shanxi Province, under the leadership of the Xinding County Party Committee this year, cooperated with various departments and relied on the masses to implement the spirit of self-reliance as the mainstay and state support as a supplement. They raised production funds, turning a shortage of production funds into a surplus.
    This year, Xinding County's agricultural production continued to leap forward, requiring 5.78 million yuan in production funds. In addition to the 1.41 million yuan of funds owned by the communes, it also needed 4.37 million yuan in state loans. At that time, the bank and credit cooperatives only had 1.09 million yuan available, leaving a shortfall of 3.28 million yuan.
    The county party committee and branch leaders analyzed the situation at the time and decided to change the practice of simply asking for funds from higher authorities and adopt a self-reliant approach to solve the problem. Their methods were: First, mobilize the masses to save idle funds for the bank to adjust and use; Second, participate in production, support production, and expand the source of funds; Third, implement the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the commune, help the commune to carefully budget, rationally arrange the use of funds, and save expenses. In implementing these methods, bank cadres closely integrated with the central work of the Party, acted under the unified plan and arrangement of the county party committee, and closely cooperated with commercial, grain, finance and other departments to support each other.
    In carrying out savings business, they explained savings policies such as voluntary deposits and free withdrawals to the members, and carefully helped the members arrange their household expenses. In this way, the enthusiasm of the members for savings increased, providing a large amount of idle funds for the bank to circulate.
    In supporting production, all rural financial work cadres in the county, according to the county party committee's plan for developing diversified economy, adopted the method of "one guarantee, two participation, and three support" to actively help the communes develop diversified economy, so that the communes could increase cash income in a short period of time. One guarantee is to draw a sum of money to ensure the needs of the commune to develop a diversified economy; two participation is to participate in production, participate in accounting, offer advice and suggestions to the commune, and broaden the channels for diversified operations; three support is to help the commune make plans for developing diversified economy, arrange labor well, contact commercial and industrial departments, increase the source of raw materials, and open up product sales channels. In the first half of the year, the diversified economy of each commune has been greatly developed. According to incomplete statistics, the county's cash income increased by 3.7 million yuan in the first half of the year due to the development of diversified economy.
    In rectifying the communes, bank cadres helped the communes rectify their finances, improve the financial management system, and properly arrange the use of funds. At the beginning of this year, the county branch organized a large number of people to conduct in-depth investigations in the communes, and found that some management areas had set the loan targets too high, so they helped to make detailed calculations, rationally verify, and lower the loan targets. In order to rationally use agricultural loans, the county branch classified and ranked the management areas in the county, focusing on assisting the management areas with poor production to develop production and increase income. In the process of rectifying the communes, bank cadres also helped the communes to clear inventory. The communes in the county cleared out commodity materials worth 680,000 yuan, as well as a batch of self-use materials.
    After the Xinding County Branch adopted these methods, it did not ask the higher authorities to increase loans, so that the original shortage of 3.28 million yuan was completely solved, and there was a surplus of 870,000 yuan, providing financial conditions for the greater development of agricultural production. Not only that, during this period, it also helped the communes to develop diversified economy, produced a large number of native fertilizers, small farm tools and other agricultural production materials, and improved the level of financial management of the communes, which played a good role in consolidating the communes. Some members composed poems to praise: The small mountain village that has been remote for thousands of years, has greatly benefited from a diversified economy. Self-reliance has turned poverty into wealth, thanks to the "small bank".

    (Our newspaper Taiyuan, July 20th) The head office of the People's Bank of China recently held an on-site conference on rural financial work in Xinding County, Shanxi Province, to summarize and promote the experience of Xinding County in mobilizing and relying on the masses, implementing the spirit of self-reliance as the mainstay and state support as a supplement, to raise the funds needed for the great leap forward in production. Through this conference, it will further promote the vigorous development of the "five good" (good execution of policies and completion of tasks, good service to the center and cooperation with all parties, good mobilization and reliance on the masses, good handling of business and reflection of the situation, hard work, solid work, clever work, and red and expert) socialist labor competition on the national rural financial work front.
    The conference of branch managers of the People's Bank of China held in May this year determined that the main tasks of rural financial work are: to vigorously organize funds to support the great leap forward in agricultural production and the consolidation and improvement of people's communes. The Xinding County Branch, based on self-reliance as the mainstay and state support as a supplement, relying on the leadership of the Party Committee, closely integrating with the central work, through organizing mass savings, supporting the development of diversified economy of the communes, increasing cash income, helping the communes to rectify financial management, arranging the use of funds, and saving the use of funds, etc., made the production funds change from insufficient to surplus, and powerfully supported agricultural production. After listening to reports, visiting and discussing, the representatives attending the meeting believed that Xinding County had set an advanced example for rural financial work.
    The meeting analyzed the current rural economic situation, believing that rural financial work across the country has achieved great results in the first half of this year, and the work tasks in the second half of the year are still very arduous. The meeting required all localities to promote the experience of Xinding County Branch according to local conditions and seize the opportunity in the current busy summer harvest and summer planting and autumn harvest and autumn planting will also gradually unfold, seize the opportunity, take the initiative to strive for the leadership of the Party Committee, rely on the masses, and do a good job in four aspects: First, through typical examples, quickly and thoroughly investigate the financial needs of the summer harvest and summer planting and autumn harvest and autumn planting, and make a plan for raising and supplying rural funds in the second half of the year, requiring that various funds from the state to support the commune and the commune's own funds be arranged uniformly, and the release and recovery of various state funds be arranged uniformly. Second, help the commune make plans for production, distribution, sale of surplus grain and industrial raw materials, and repayment of state loans, and promote the realization. Third, regularly help the commune develop diversified economy and rectify finances, save commune expenditures, and increase income of members. Fourth, after the summer harvest and autumn harvest, we must strengthen the work of receiving and storing goods, and prepare a large amount of funds to support commune production and ensure the needs of various national tasks.
    The 231 representatives from Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong provinces, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Beijing who attended the on-site conference, in order to learn and promote the work experience of Xinding County and successfully complete the tasks of the current and future period, put forward an initiative to the national rural financial workers. They proposed to resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party Committee, obey the unified arrangement of the Party Committee, serve the central work of the Party, take the center to drive the business, and take the business to promote the central work; implement the spirit of relying on the masses, taking self-reliance as the mainstay and state support as a supplement, and raise and arrange rural funds; vigorously carry out rural savings business, gather rural idle funds for production; support the poor mountainous areas, old liberated areas, and support the communes and teams with poor economic conditions, and develop production; and resolutely and continuously carry out the "five good" socialist labor competition.

    银行干部参预生产扶植生产
    中国人民银行推广忻定县经验
    本报太原20日电　中国人民银行山西省忻定县支行，今年在中共忻定县委领导下，与各部门协作，依靠群众，贯彻自力更生为主，国家支援为辅的精神，筹措生产资金，使生产资金由不足变为有余。
    忻定县今年农业生产继续大跃进，需要生产资金五百七十八万元，除公社自有资金一百四十一万元以外，还需要国家贷款四百三十七万元，当时银行和信用部可用资金只有一百零九万元，还差三百二十八万元没有着落。
    县委和支行领导上分析了当时的情况，决定改变单纯向上级要款的作法，采取自力更生的办法来解决。他们的办法是：一，发动群众把闲置的资金储蓄起来，供银行调剂使用；二，参与生产，扶植生产，扩大资金源泉；三，贯彻勤俭办社的精神，帮助公社精打细算，合理安排资金用途，节省开支。银行干部在实行这些办法中，紧密结合党的中心工作，在县委统一计划统一安排下行动，同时与商业、粮食、财政等部门密切协作，互相支援。
    在开展储蓄业务方面，向社员们解释存款自愿、取款自由等储蓄政策，细致地帮助社员安排家庭开支。这样，社员们的储蓄积极性提高，提供了大笔闲置资金供银行周转使用。
    在扶植生产方面，全县农村金融工作干部，根据县委发展多种经济的规划，采取“一保、二参、三支援”的办法，积极帮助公社发展多种经济，使公社在短期内就能增加现金收入。一保是抽出一笔资金，保证公社发展多种经济的需要；二参是参预生产，参加核算，为公社出谋献策，广辟多种经营的门路；三支援是帮助公社作好发展多种经济的规划，安排好劳力，与商业、工业部门联系，增加原料来源，打开产品销路。上半年，各公社的多种经济得到很大发展。据不完全统计，上半年全县因发展多种经济增加了现金收入三百七十万元。
    在整顿公社中，银行干部结合帮助公社整顿财务，健全财务管理制度，妥善安排资金开支。今年年初，县支行组织大批人员深入公社调查，发现部分管理区把要求贷款的指标订得过大，于是帮助算细账，合理核实，降低了贷款指标。为了合理使用农业贷款，县支行把全县管理区分类排队，着重辅助生产较差的管理区发展生产，增加收入。在整社过程中，银行干部还帮助公社清理库存，全县各公社共清理出商品性物资价值达六十八万元，还有一批自用的物资。
    忻定县支行采取这些办法以后，没有要求上级增加贷款，使原来缺少的三百二十八万元资金全部解决，还长余八十七万元，为农业生产的更大发展提供了资金上的条件。不仅如此，在这期间，还帮助公社发展了多种经济，生产出大量土化肥、小农具等农业生产资料，提高了公社财务管理的水平，对于巩固公社起了良好的作用。有的社员编出诗歌赞颂道：千年偏僻小山庄，多种经济大沾光，自力更生穷变富，多亏有了“小银行”。
    本报太原20日电　中国人民银行总行最近在山西省忻定县召开农村金融工作现场会议，总结和推广忻定县发动群众依靠群众，贯彻以自力更生为主、国家支援为辅的精神，筹集生产大跃进所需资金的经验。通过这次会议，将进一步促进全国农村金融工作战线上的“五好”（执行政策完成任务好、服务中心协作各方好、发动群众依靠群众好、处理业务反映情况好、苦干实干巧干又红又专好）社会主义劳动竞赛蓬勃地展开。
    今年5月间召开的中国人民银行分行行长会议，确定农村金融工作的主要任务是：大力组织资金，支持农业生产大跃进和人民公社的巩固提高。忻定县支行以自力更生为主、以国家支援为辅，依靠党委的领导，紧密结合中心工作，通过组织群众储蓄，支持公社发展多种经济，增加现金收入，帮助公社整顿财务管理，安排资金使用，节省资金开支等办法，使生产资金由不足变为有余，有力地支援了农业生产。出席会议的代表经过听报告、参观、讨论，认为忻定县为农村金融工作树立了一个先进榜样。
    会议分析了当前农村的经济形势，认为今年上半年全国农村金融工作取得了很大成绩，下半年的工作任务仍然十分艰巨。会议要求各地因时因地制宜地推广忻定县支行的经验，在当前夏收夏种繁忙和秋收秋种也将逐渐展开的大好季节，抓住时机，主动争取党委领导，依靠群众，作好四方面的工作：一、通过典型，迅速深入细致地调查清楚夏收夏种和秋收秋种需要资金的情况，作好下半年筹集与供应农村资金的计划，要求作到国家支援公社的各种资金与公社自有资金统一安排，国家各种资金的投放与收回统一安排。二、帮助公社作好生产、分配、出售余粮和工业原料以及归还国家贷款的计划，并促进实现。三、经常地帮助公社发展多种经济和整顿财务，节约公社支出，增加社员收入。四、在夏收和秋收后要加强收货和收储工作，准备大量的资金支援公社生产和保证国家各项工作的需要。
    参加现场会议的辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、河北、山西、山东六省、内蒙古自治区和北京市的二百三十一位代表，为了学习和推广忻定县的工作经验，圆满地完成当前和今后一个时期的任务，向全国农村金融工作人员提出了倡议。他们提出，坚决依靠党委的领导，服从党委统一安排，服务于党的中心工作，以中心带动业务，以业务促进中心工作；贯彻依靠群众，以自力更生为主、以国家支援为辅的精神，筹集、安排好农村资金；大力开展农村储蓄业务，聚集农村闲散资金用于生产；扶持贫困山区、老解放区，扶持经济条件较差的社、队，发展生产；坚决持续开展“五好”社会主义劳动竞赛。
