Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 11th: Industrial and mining enterprises, transportation departments, and residents of Chongqing have devised various methods to conserve coal.

Industrial and mining enterprises, which account for over 90% of the city's coal consumption, plan to reduce coal consumption by 8% in the third quarter. The main approach involves vigorous technological innovation and improvement of coal-burning operational techniques. Leading cadres at the Chongqing Hezhong Glass Factory have adopted the method of cultivating "experimental plots" to improve the furnace's flue dampers, standardize coal-loading procedures, and load coal regularly and quantitatively, maintaining a uniform coal bed thickness. This has reduced coal consumption from 1.8 tons to 1 ton per ton of glass material. Many factories and mining enterprises are also adopting measures such as rationally using different types of coal separately and improving raw coal management to conserve coal.

Since the fourth quarter of last year, government offices, military units, factories, schools, and residents in Chongqing have generally paid attention to conserving coal for daily life. So far, average daily coal consumption per person has been reduced from 18 liang (approximately 900 grams) to 14 liang (approximately 700 grams). The people of the city are continuing to devise methods to save another 2 liang (approximately 100 grams) of coal per person per day in the third quarter of this year.

    重庆革新技术合理用煤
    据新华社重庆11日电  重庆市工矿企业、交通运输部门和广大居民想出多种办法节约用煤。
    用煤占全市耗煤量90％以上的工矿、企业单位，准备在第三季度降低煤耗8％。办法主要是大闹技术革新，改进烧煤操作技术。重庆合众玻璃厂领导干部采用搞试验田的办法，改进了炉子的烟道闸门，统一了上煤操作法，定时定量上煤，保持煤层厚薄均匀，从而使化一吨玻璃料的耗煤量，由一点八吨下降到一吨。许多厂矿企业单位还采用按煤的品种分别合理使用、改善原煤管理等办法节约煤焦。
    从去年第四季度以来，重庆市机关、部队、工厂、学校、居民已普遍注意节约生活用煤；到目前为止，已由原来每人每日平均用煤十八两降低到十四两。全市人民正在继续想办法，争取在今年第三季度每人每天再节约生活用煤二两。
