    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 19th: Fujian Province has achieved great success in spare-time cultural learning for cadres above the district level, and the cultural level of the broad masses of worker-peasant cadres has gradually improved.

    According to statistics from forty-six counties and cities including Fuzhou, Xiamen, Fu'an, Yongchun, and Shanghang, these counties and cities now have one hundred and eleven spare-time cultural schools for cadres at all levels, with more than 26,000 cadres regularly participating in learning. Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou and other places have also established cadre spare-time universities and specialized classes.

    The development of spare-time education for cadres has gradually improved the cultural level of the broad masses of cadres, especially worker-peasant cadres. Every year, a large number of people improve their level to higher elementary, junior high, or senior high school graduation level through spare-time learning. Many cadres have been admitted to universities for further study after spare-time learning. The spare-time middle school attached to Fuzhou No. 5 Middle School alone has sent more than 100 worker-peasant cadres to study at Shanghai First Medical College, Xiamen University, and other universities since 1953. Many worker-peasant cadres who were originally illiterate or semi-literate are now able to write plans and summary reports on their own after spare-time learning. Zheng Zhimei, the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch of the Fuqing Machine Factory, was originally semi-literate. After attending the Fuqing County Cadre Cultural School, she is now able to understand Chairman Mao's works and other political theory books, write simple work summaries, and study technology. Lin Zhilong, a warehouse keeper at Fuzhou Railway Station, created a material card system after learning culture and adopted a scientific stacking method, which not only saved labor but also improved the storage of materials.

    In order to further consolidate and develop spare-time cultural education for cadres, the Fujian Provincial Department of Education recently held a provincial symposium on cadre cultural education to summarize and exchange work experience, and to study and deploy work for the second half of the year.

    福建干部业余教育大发展
    广大工农干部文化水平有了提高
    新华社福州19日电　福建省区级以上机关干部业余文化学习获得巨大成绩，广大工农干部的文化水平逐步有了提高。
    据福州、厦门、福安、永春、上杭等四十六个县市统计，这些县市现在设有各级各类干部业余文化学校一百一十一所，经常参加学习的干部有两万六千多人。福州、泉州、漳州等地还创办了干部业余大学和专业班。
    干部业余教育的发展，使广大干部特别是工农干部的文化水平逐渐提高，每年都有大批人通过业余学习分别提高到高小、初中或高中毕业水平。有不少干部经过业余学习升入高等学校继续深造，仅福州第五中学附设业余中学统计，从1953年以来就已输送了一百多个工农干部进入上海第一医学院、厦门大学等高等学校学习。许多原来是文盲或半文盲的工农干部，经过业余学习，现在都能自己动手写计划，写总结报告。中共福清机器厂支部书记郑只妹仔原来是半文盲，在参加福清县机关干部文化学校学习后，现在已能看懂毛主席的著作和其他政治理论书籍，能动手写简单的工作总结，并能钻研技术。福州火车站仓库管理员林知龙学习了文化以后，创造了物资卡片制度，采取科学垛叠法，既节省了人力，又使物资保管得更好。
    为了进一步巩固和发展干部业余文化教育，福建省教育厅最近举行了全省干部文化教育座谈会，总结交流工作经验，并对下半年工作做了研究和部署。
