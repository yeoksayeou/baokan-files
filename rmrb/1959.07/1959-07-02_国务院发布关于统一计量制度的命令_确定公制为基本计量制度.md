Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The State Council's Order on Unifying China's System of Measurement.

    The 86th Plenary Session of the State Council on March 22, 1959, approved in principle the "Report of the Science and Technology Commission on Unifying China's System of Measurement and Further Developing Metrology Work" and the "Plan for Unified Chinese Names of Metric Units." The order is now issued as follows:

    1. The international metric system (also known as the meter system, or simply the metric system) is a system of measurement characterized by decimal progression, which is easy to use and has been adopted by most countries in the world. It is now determined as China's basic system of measurement and will be promoted and used throughout the country. The market system, which was originally based on the international metric system, has been commonly used and become a habit in the daily life of the Chinese people and can be retained.

    The market system originally stipulated that sixteen taels equal one catty (jin). Because the conversion is cumbersome, it should be uniformly changed to ten taels equal one catty (jin). The timing and steps of this reform shall be decided by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government. For traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, the original units of measurement may continue to be used without reform to prevent calculation errors.

    2. The British system used in China should be changed to the metric system, except for special needs where it can continue to be used.

    In some remote areas and minority areas where the old miscellaneous systems are still in use, the habits of the masses in these areas, ethnic characteristics, and the avoidance of affecting market transactions should be taken into account, and prudent steps should be taken for reform. How to reform shall be decided by the relevant provincial and autonomous region people's committees.

    The nautical mile (n mile) can continue to be used because it is a widely used unit for calculating sea distances internationally.

    3. All those who adopt the metric system should gradually adopt the unified Chinese names of metric units in accordance with the "Plan for Unified Chinese Names of Metric Units." Those who continue to use the market system will keep the names of the measurement units unchanged. The Chinese names of metric units not specified in the plan shall be formulated, promulgated, and implemented by the Science and Technology Commission of the People's Republic of China.

    4. In order to ensure the uniformity of China's measurement system, the consistency, accuracy, and correct use of measuring instruments, it is necessary to quickly establish and improve the national measurement benchmarks and the various levels of measurement standards, as well as regional and enterprise measurement institutions, to form a national measurement network and further develop measurement work. Measurement institutions at the provincial, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government levels should be established and improved as soon as possible. The establishment of measurement institutions at all levels below the provincial, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government levels and in enterprises shall be determined by the people's committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government as needed. Measurement institutions at all levels shall be under the leadership of the science and technology commissions at the corresponding level. In places where science and technology commissions have not been established, the people's committees at the corresponding level shall designate the corresponding departments to lead.

        The State Council, June 25, 1959

    国务院发布关于统一计量制度的命令
    确定公制为基本计量制度
    新华社1日讯　国务院关于统一我国计量制度的命令
    1959年3月22日国务院全体会议第86次会议原则通过了“科学技术委员会关于统一我国计量制度和进一步开展计量工作的报告”和“统一公制计量单位中文名称方案”，现在发布命令如下：
    一、国际公制（即米突制，简称公制）是一种以十进十退为特点的计量制度，使用简便，已经为世界上多数国家所采用，现在确定为我国的基本计量制度，在全国范围内推广使用。原来以国际公制为基础所制定的市制，在我国人民日常生活中已经习惯通用，可以保留。
    市制原定十六两为一斤，因为折算麻烦，应当一律改为十两为一斤；这一改革的时间和步骤，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会自行决定。中医处方用药，为了防止计算差错，可以继续使用原有的计量单位，不予改革。
    二、在我国使用的英制，除了因为特殊需要可以继续使用外，应当一律改用公制。
    有些偏僻地区和少数民族地区还在继续使用旧杂制的，应当照顾这些地区的群众习惯、民族特点和避免影响市场的交易，采取稳妥步骤予以改革。如何改革，由有关省、自治区人民委员会自行决定。
    海里（浬）因为是国际间广泛通用的计算海程单位，可以继续使用。
    三、凡是采用公制的，都应当按照“统一公制计量单位中文名称方案”逐步采用统一的公制计量单位中文名称；继续沿用市制的，计量单位名称不变。方案中未规定的计量单位中文名称，由中华人民共和国科学技术委员会制定公布施行。
    四、为了保证我国计量制度的统一，计量器具的一致、准确和正确使用，应当迅速建立和健全国家的各种计量基准器和各级计量标准器以及地区的和企业的计量机构，构成全国计量网，进一步地开展计量工作。省、自治区、直辖市一级的计量机构，应当尽快地建立和健全起来。省、自治区、直辖市以下各级计量机构和企业的计量机构的建立，由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会根据需要自行决定。各级计量机构统归同级科学技术委员会领导。在没有成立科学技术委员会的地方，由各该级人民委会员指定相应的部门领导。
        国务院　1959年6月25日
