　　Bulgaria Holds National Games and Arts Festival
　　In order to welcome the 15th anniversary of National Day on September 9th, Bulgaria held the National Games and Youth Arts Festival from July 4th to 12th. During these days, the Bulgarian capital Sofia was like a large stadium and a large theater. Thirty-one thousand athletes and thirteen thousand actors and artists from all over the country gathered together to show their skills.
　　The games were held in two stages. The first stage was held last year. Last year, competitions were first held in various units. Those with excellent results participated in local and township games, and then the competitions were transferred to county-wide and state-wide sports meets. Finally, representatives from the state were selected to participate in the second stage of the National Games. 1.8 million people participated in the first stage of the games, which means that on average, one out of every four people in Bulgaria participated in the competition.
