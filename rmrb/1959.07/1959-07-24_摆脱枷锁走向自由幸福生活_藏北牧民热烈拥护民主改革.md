Xinhua News Agency, Heihe, July 23rd. On the vast grasslands of northern Tibet, herdsmen are enthusiastically cheering the resolution passed by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region regarding the implementation of democratic reforms in the entire region of Tibet. They are rejoicing that they have finally shaken off the miserable fate of generations of oppression and exploitation and are beginning to move towards a new life of freedom and happiness.

    Since the dissolution of the former Tibetan local government, herdsmen in the northern Tibetan region have been demanding the abolition of various forms of feudal oppression and exploitation, particularly the abolition of the Ula corvée system, usurious exploitation, and personal enslavement. During the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the calls from herdsmen for democratic reform became even louder. Solang Caizhu, a herdsman from the Chiba Riwa tribe, burst into tears when he mentioned the high-interest loans from the lords. He said, "High-interest loans are like wolves, and in the past, they devoured the lives of countless poor people." Five years ago, he borrowed half a bag of tsampa from the lord. In the following years, the tsampa he repaid had exceeded the original amount by more than tenfold, and most of his cattle and sheep had also fallen into the hands of the lord to pay off the debt, but the high-interest loan was still not cleared. Once, he was unable to raise enough tsampa to repay the debt, and the lord even whipped his wife to death and seized his family's only broken tent, a sleeping mat, and a saddle.

    Old herdsman Awang, in order to avoid taxes and levies, had been wandering with his family for several years, unable to live a settled life. Awang's two daughters were raped by Tibetan soldiers when they were taken to "support the corvée" a few years ago. When the resolution of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region on carrying out democratic reforms reached the pastoral areas, Awang said, "Now I have nothing to fear. In the past, when a dog barked outside the tent, I was afraid it was someone coming to demand Ula. When I heard the sound of horses' hooves, I knew it was someone coming to collect taxes. Today we are free!" His daughters said, "The bad guys will never dare to bully us again!"

    A citizen of Heihe named Zhaxi was both happy and sad after hearing the resolution of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region on carrying out democratic reforms. Two years ago, Zhaxi had to sell his two children with great pain because he could not afford the heavy tribute. Under the pressure of taxes and levies, the tragedy of selling one's own children often occurred in various tribes in northern Tibet. Solang Banzong and Angzhu, two herdsmen from the Chiba Riwa tribe, each exchanged a child for brick tea to pay taxes to the former Tibetan local government.

    The herdsmen who suffered the most cruel oppression and exploitation were particularly excited about the resolution of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region. There are two types of herdsmen in northern Tibet: "Yaba" and "Chayue". Although "Yaba" generally had personal freedom, they still suffered inhuman humiliation and torture during their employment. "Chayue" were lifelong slaves, similar to the "Langsheng" (house slaves) in the agricultural areas of Tibet. In the pastoral areas of northern Tibet, these two types of herdsmen were the lowest status "untouchables." They had to work like cattle and horses for more than fourteen to sixteen hours a day, and could only eat three small wooden bowls (weighing about half a catty in total) of tsampa and a few bowls of sour milk water. At night, regardless of winter or summer, rain or snow, they could only sleep with the livestock in the open air. The annual wage of a "Yaba" was an old sheepskin robe with a smooth surface, a pair of boots, a hat, or a ewe, and they were unable to support their families for their entire lives. The lives of female herdsmen were even more difficult. Pregnant female herdsmen had to endure labor pains before giving birth, and they could not get a moment's rest after giving birth. Female "Yaba" Gesang Zhuoma said that in her decades of herding life, her hair had been pulled out by her master, her teeth had been knocked out by her master, and her body had been insulted. In the eyes of the master, herdsmen were nothing more than talking cattle and horses, and they were often beaten and scolded. Once, Gesang Zhuoma forgot to lick the bottom of the bowl clean when drinking tea and was slapped more than forty times by her master. Gesang Zhuoma said, "Today, with the policy of benefiting both herdsmen and herders, the abolition of feudal privileges, and the lifting of personal dependence, we herdsmen are truly saved!"

    In order to maintain its dark rule, the former Tibetan local government specially established a ruling body in Heihe City called "Qiangji" (Northern General Manager). According to incomplete statistics, "Qiangji" alone levied as many as fifty or sixty kinds of corvée taxes in northern Tibet each year. The amount of exploitation of herdsmen by lords through Ula, tribute, and usury accounted for more than 80% of the herdsmen's annual income. Despite working hard all year round, the herdsmen were still poorly clothed and fed. For many years, the herdsmen had hoped to be liberated from these cannibalistic systems.

    In recent decades, the herdsmen on the northern Tibetan grasslands had spontaneously organized armed uprisings several times, but the results were all defeated under the cruel suppression of the former Tibetan local government. Now, the herdsmen have realized their desire to abolish the old system. They have stated that after the abolition of the Ula corvée, high-interest loans, and personal enslavement, and the implementation of the policy of benefiting both herdsmen and herders, they will surely make the vast grasslands prosperous with both people and livestock, and allow everyone to live a free and happy life.

### 摆脱枷锁走向自由幸福生活  藏北牧民热烈拥护民主改革

    摆脱枷锁走向自由幸福生活
    藏北牧民热烈拥护民主改革
    新华社黑河23日电　在西藏北方辽阔的草原上，牧民们热烈欢呼西藏自治区筹委会通过关于在西藏全区进行民主改革的决议，欢呼他们从此摆脱世代遭受压迫和剥削的悲惨命运，开始走向自由幸福的新生活。
    藏北地区的牧民们在原西藏地方政府被解散以后，就纷纷要求废除各种封建压迫和剥削，特别要求取消乌拉差役制度、高利贷剥削和人身奴役。在西藏自治区筹委会第二次全体委员会议进行期间，牧民们要求实行民主改革的呼声更加高涨。赤巴日瓦部落牧民索郎采珠一提起领主们的高利贷就伤心落泪，他说：“高利贷像狼一样，过去不知吞掉了多少穷人的生命。”五年前，他借了领主半口袋?粑，以后几年中陆续偿还的?粑数已超过原借数的十几倍，他的大部分牛羊也因为还债而到了领主的手里，但是高利贷却仍旧没有还清。有一次他一时筹借不到?粑还债，领主竟用皮鞭打死了他的妻子，还抢走了他家唯一的一顶破帐篷、一床睡垫和一副马鞍。
    老牧民阿旺为了躲避差税，几年来全家东奔西走，不能过安定的生活。阿旺的两个女儿几年前被拉去“支差”时，遭到了藏兵的奸污。当西藏自治区筹委会关于进行民主改革的决议传到牧区以后，阿旺说：“现在我什么都不用害怕了，过去帐篷外狗一叫，就害怕是支乌拉的来了，马蹄声一响，就知道是派税的来了。今天我们自由了！”他的女儿们说：“坏蛋再也不敢欺侮我们了！”
    一个名叫扎西的黑河市民，在听到自治区筹委会关于进行民主改革的决议后，又高兴又难过。两年前，扎西因为一时交不起沉重的贡税，不得不忍痛把自己的两个孩子卖掉了。在差税逼迫下，藏北各部落里经常发生出卖亲生骨肉的惨事，赤巴日瓦部落的牧民索郎班宗和昂珠两人就曾经各用一个孩子换了砖茶去向原西藏地方政府交税。
    受到压迫剥削最残酷的牧工们对自治区筹委会的决议特别兴奋。藏北有两种牧工，就是“压巴”和“差约”。“压巴”虽然一般有人身自由，但在受雇期间仍然要遭受非人的凌辱和折磨；“差约”是类似西藏农业区“郎生”（家奴）的终生奴隶。在藏北牧区，这两种牧工都是社会地位最低的“贱民”，他们每天要像牛马一样劳动十四到十六个小时以上，一天只能吃到三小木碗（共重约半斤）?粑和几碗酸奶水。晚上，他们不分冬夏雨雪，只能与畜群露宿在一起。“压巴”全年的工资是一件光面老羊皮袄、一双靴、一顶帽，或者是一只母羊，一辈子也无力养家活口。女牧工的生活更加困苦，怀孕的女牧工在临产前还得忍着腹痛劳动，产后也得不到片刻休息。女“压巴”格桑卓姆说，她在过去几十年牧工生活中，头发被主人扯掉过，牙齿被主人打掉过，身体遭受过侮辱。在主人眼里，当牧工的不过是会说话的牛马，动不动就要遭到打骂。有一次，格桑卓姆喝茶时忘记将碗底舐干净，便被主人打了四十多个嘴巴。格桑卓姆说：“今天，有了牧工牧主两利的政策，取消了封建特权，解除了人身依附，我们当牧工的才真正得救了！”
    原西藏地方政府为维护它的黑暗统治，专门在黑河市设立了一个统治机构“羌机”（北方总管）。据不完全统计，仅“羌机”每年在藏北摊派的差税即有五、六十种之多。领主通过乌拉、贡税和高利贷对牧民的剥削量，占到牧民全年收入的80％以上。牧民尽管劳累终年，仍然衣不蔽体，食不果腹。多少年来，牧民们就盼望能从这些吃人的制度下解放出来。
    近几十年，藏北草原上的牧民们曾经几次自发地组织过武装起义，但结果都在原西藏地方政府的残酷镇压下遭到了失败。现在，牧民们已经实现了他们废除旧制度的愿望，他们纷纷表示，在废除了乌拉差役、高利贷和人身奴役，实行了牧工牧主两利政策以后，他们一定能使辽阔的草原上人畜兴旺，让人们都过自由幸福的生活。
