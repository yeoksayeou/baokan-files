Following the development of the situation, the Chinese Communist Party has absorbed a large number of new party members. These new party members urgently need to learn the basic knowledge of the Party, raise their awareness, and master the Party's basic principles. Many old party members who joined the Party for a longer period of time also need to continuously improve themselves in order to adapt to the new situation and successfully complete the tasks assigned by the Party. Therefore, it is a very necessary and important task for grassroots party organizations to persist in amateur party class education. The example of the Dayantong Party Branch adhering to party class education illustrates the significant role of party class education.

The characteristics of the Dayantong Party Branch's adherence to party class education are that it is closely linked to reality and is flexible and mobile. In this way, party class education has been sustained under the current circumstances of tight production, busy work, and little spare time.

Of course, in party class education, it is not easy to make party members systematically understand the basic knowledge of the Party, while also vividly connecting with reality, thought, and central work. This requires party organizations and teachers to do a lot of hard and meticulous work, and to explore experience in practice. The Dayantong Party Branch has already gained preliminary experience in this regard. We hope to attract the attention of grassroots party organizations, better summarize the experience in this area, and promote it.

    坚持党课教育
    随着形势的发展，中国共产党吸收了大批新党员，这批新党员迫切需要学习党的基本知识，提高觉悟，掌握党的基本原则；许多入党较久的老党员，为适应新情况、出色地完成党所分配的任务，也需要不断提高自己。因此，在基层党组织坚持业余党课教育，是很必要的一项重要工作。大烟筒党支部坚持党课教育的事例，说明了党课教育的重大作用。
    大烟筒党支部坚持党课教育的特点是联系实际，灵活机动。这样，就使党课教育在当前生产紧、工作忙、业余时间少的情况下，坚持了下来。
    当然，在党课教育中，既要使党员系统地懂得党的基本知识，又要生动地联系实际、联系思想、联系中心工作，是不容易的。这需要党组织和教员做许多艰苦细致的工作，需要在实践中去摸索经验。大烟筒党支部在这方面已经取得了初步的经验。我们希望引起各基层党组织的注意，更好地总结这方面的经验，加以推广。
