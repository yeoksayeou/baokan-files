    Record Harvest on the "Worthless Land"
    Zhou Guangyao, Liu Duxiang
    On July 9th, Secretary Sun of the CCP You County Supervisory Committee in Hunan Province came to the Yangzijiang Production Team of the Zhongjiaqiao Brigade in the Yinkeng Commune. He was just about to go down to the fields to cut rice when a young man bounded up to him, shouting, "Secretary Sun! Secretary Sun! The 'Worthless Land' has turned over a new leaf! Come and inspect it!"
    With that, he grabbed Secretary Sun's hand and pulled him towards Muddy Pond. At that moment, Grandpa He, a white-haired nonagenarian, followed behind with a big smile. Secretary Sun looked at the old man and asked, "Grandpa, it's so hot, where are you going?" Grandpa He replied, "Going to see the rice." The three of them walked forward, chatting and laughing. Grandpa He gestured to Secretary Sun, saying:
  "This field is in Muddy Pond, a total of 312 plots, covering 19.7 mu. I farmed it for thirty years, but it never improved. The field is surrounded by high mountains, and the trees on the mountains were all cut down by the bandit Luo Fengnan. There's only a five-foot-wide opening at the tail end of the gully; when it rains heavily, you can't tell north from south; if it doesn't rain for ten days, Muddy Pond faces the sky. As for the soil quality, it's good for making bricks and tiles, but it just doesn't grow grain. I farmed it for thirty years, and even in good years with favorable weather, I only harvested eighty jin of grain per mu; in dry and flooded years, the labor was wasted, and I still lost money. In the first year of the Republic of China, I planned to grow miscellaneous grains, but the landlord was unreasonable and spouted nonsense, saying 'According to my calculations, even without fertilizer, there will be a ten-fold harvest this year,' forcing me to grow rice. That year, I only rested for two days, and the straw sandals I wore used up four dan of rice stalks. But the cursed heavens were uncooperative, and we suffered four floods in a row, replanting the seedlings four times; later, we were hit by insect plagues, and only harvested forty jin of unhusked rice per mu. I calculated that the rice harvested wasn't even enough to cover the rent for the farm tools and the cost of the straw sandals. I hardened my heart, sold all my furniture, and paid off the landlord's rent. I gave up on this field. At that time, someone sang a song: Muddy Pond, a cursed place, sucking people's blood, grinding people's bones; when the floods come, the seedlings are gone; in the drought, there's a great famine; working to death gets you nowhere. Therefore, everyone called this field the 'Worthless Land.'"
    As they talked and walked, they crossed two mountains. The sounds of carrying poles, singing, and shouting broke the silence in the mountain gully. Grandpa He wiped away tears, and a smile appeared in the wrinkles on his face. He continued, "Since that year, I haven't been back to the 'Worthless Land' for decades. I heard people say that after I left, this field lay barren for many years. Earlier this year, I heard that the rice in the 'Worthless Land' was growing well, and I wanted to come and see it a long time ago, but the people at the nursing home said I was too old and wouldn't let me out. Today, I couldn't keep my heart in any longer. I sneaked out."
    The inspection began. Secretary Sun held the scale, and load after load of full, plump rice was carried down the mountain. Grandpa He, like a child, would grab a handful of rice to rub and feel, then grab another handful to smell.
    At noon, the commune members were all taking a nap. Secretary Sun, Grandpa He, and General Branch Secretary Chen Zhaofan were still happily talking. Chen Zhaofan said to Secretary Sun, "I was born and raised here. The changes in Muddy Pond's 'Worthless Land' are enough to fill a book. This field was barren until it was reclaimed in 1949. In recent years, we've planted trees on the mountains, dug fish-scale pits, and improved the soil every year. In 1952, the yield per mu was 280 jin; in 1955, the yield per mu was 310 jin; in 1957, the advanced cooperative switched to growing double-cropping rice, and the yield per mu was 370 jin; in 1958, the yield per mu was 445 jin. After the communization in the second half of last year, the commune members said that now we have even greater strength, and proposed the slogan 'March towards low-yield fields, and make the Worthless Land completely turn over a new leaf.' In order to build a reservoir here to store the floodwater from the mountains and irrigate the fields below, the commune members put in a great effort. Old artisan Liu Donglin rushed to build two sections of a five-li-long cableway in ten days to transport sand up the mountain. When there was a shortage of firebricks for building the culvert, bricklayer Cai Zuzai used bamboo strips to make a model, mixed yellow mud, lime, and bone meal, and made culvert pipes locally, burning them with thatch until they were as hard as stone. The reservoir was built, and people dug more than 260 fish-scale pits, each with a water storage dam below. Although it rained heavily for a long time earlier this year, the water from the whole mountain was 'eaten up' by the reservoir, fish-scale pits, and water storage dams." Then, Chen Zhaofan talked about the farming situation here: "Last winter, we used a method of double plowing with close plows to deepen the mud foot by three inches. In December, we had 'people and cattle up the mountain, accumulating fertilizer on the mountain,' and I and more than twenty commune members lived on the mountain for more than a month. After the field was plowed, we applied nearly two hundred dan of pig and cattle manure per mu, covered with a layer of rice straw, bran, and leaves; during the second plowing and harrowing, we also released 1,600 dan of pit manure together, and carried in nearly 6,000 dan of river sand; the third time, we applied 3,000 dan of pond mud; the fourth time, we applied over 5,500 dan of ditch fertilizer, human manure, and green manure. The barren field, which had been considered impossible to transform for decades, suddenly became a 'meat bowl field.' With fertilizer, we also had to control pests. This place has been plagued by pests every year. This year, the commune members said: In ancient times, someone used an axe to split a mountain to save his mother, our sickles are sharper than his axe, and we will split the mountain to control pests. We organized twenty 'mountain-splitting soldiers,' connected ladders, and tied ropes around their waists, climbing up the high embankments one by one. When they couldn't reach the grass far away when cutting it, they tied the sickle to a long bamboo handle to cut. In just three days, they cut down the weeds on the mountain cliffs that were more than three li long and more than three zhang high, and destroyed the insect nests. We also manufactured local pesticides and treated the insects when we found them. Commune member Ai Youyuan used many methods such as setting traps, poisoning, using dummies, wind clappers, and water clappers to subdue the wild animals and field mice here. The Nantai variety we planted this year is very suitable for the soil; planting at 3×7 inches is an appropriate density. Field management has been meticulous, and lodging has also been prevented."
    Speaking of this, Chen Zhaofan suddenly remembered something and said with emotion, "In the past, dealing with this field was always a problem. But now it has changed. The power of the commune is really great!"
    In the afternoon, the rice was harvested, and the recorders totaled the numbers, a total of 15,287 jin and 12 liang, averaging 776 jin of unhusked rice per mu. The actual harvest of dry rice was 12,214 jin and 4 liang, averaging a little more than 620 jin per mu, an increase of 39% compared to the early and late rice harvests last year. Grandpa He grabbed Secretary Sun's hand and said, word by word, "More than forty years ago, the heart that died in Muddy Pond has now come back to life. Not only is this old man getting younger and younger, but even the 'Worthless Land' that I farmed for thirty years has completely turned over a new leaf." (Attached photo)

    “败子田”丰收记
    周光耀　刘督祥
    7月9日，中共湖南攸县监委会孙书记来到了银坑公社钟佳桥大队阳子江生产队，正准备下田割禾，一个小伙子连蹦带跳到了他面前，喊道：“孙书记！孙书记！‘败子田’翻了身，你快去验收。”
    说完，他拉着孙书记的手就往木底塘跑。这时，白发苍苍、年已九十岁的何公公笑哈哈的跟在后面来了。孙书记望着老人问道：“老大爷，天气这么热，你到那儿去？”何公公说：“看谷子去。”三个人有说有笑往前走去。何公公用手比划着向孙书记说：
  “这块田在木底塘，一共有三百一十二丘，十九亩七分大，在我手里耕种了三十年，总不翻身。田四周是高山，山上的树被罗丰南土匪砍光了。冲尾上只有五尺宽的口，落得一刻雨，分不清天南地北；十天不落雨，木底塘朝天。讲土质，作砖瓦是上装货，就是不长粮食。我作了三十年，风调雨顺的好年成，一亩收得八十斤谷；干旱、水涝年景，花了工不算数，还要赔本。‘民国’元年，我打算作杂粮，东家不讲理，说鬼话，他说‘掐指一算，今年不下肥有十熟收成’，逼着我作禾。这一年，我只休息过两天，光穿的草鞋就用了四担禾秆。鬼打的天爷不争气，连遭四次洪水，重插了四遍秧；后来又遭了虫灾，一亩只收四十斤毛谷。我算了算，收的谷连农具租钱、草鞋费都不够。我硬着心肠，把家具卖得精光，还了东家的租谷。投下石头，死了这条心，不作木底塘这块田了。那时有人唱出一首歌子：木底塘，鬼地方，吸人血，磨人王；洪水来，苗儿光；干旱天，遭大荒；累得死，没下场。因此，大家就把这块田叫做了‘败子田’。”
    他们说着走着，翻过了两座山，扮桶的响声、歌声和吆喝声，冲破了山冲里的沉寂。何公公揩了揩泪花，脸上皱纹里出现了笑容，继续说：“从那年起，几十年我没有再来过‘败子田’。听人们说，自从我外出后，这块田荒了好多年。今年前些时听说‘败子田’的禾长得好，早就想来看一看，就是敬老院的人说我老了，不肯让我出来。今天我的心关不住了。偷着跑出来了。”
    验收开始了，孙书记掌着秤，一担担十粒五双的谷子从山上担下去。何公公像个小孩似的，一会抓把谷子揉摸揉摸，一会抓把谷子放在鼻子上闻闻。
    中午，社员们都午睡了。孙书记、何公公和总支书记陈兆凡还在高兴地谈着。陈兆凡对孙书记说：“我是土生土长的，木底塘‘败子田’的变化硬写得一本书。这块田抛荒到1949年才开过来，这几年在山上植了树，挖了鱼鳞坑，年年改良土壤。1952年亩产二百八十斤；1955年亩产三百一十斤；1957年高级社改种双季稻，亩产三百七十斤；1958年亩产四百四十五斤。去年下半年公社化后，社员们说，这下力量更大了，提出‘向低产田进军，叫败子田彻底翻身’的口号。为了在这里修个水库，蓄山上的洪水，灌下面的田，社员们出了大力。老艺工刘冬林突击了十天，架设了两段五里长的索道，运沙子上山。修涵洞缺火砖，砖匠蔡祖仔用竹篾编成模型，把黄泥、石灰、白骨泥混合，在当地制成了涵管，用茅柴烧得像石头那样硬。水库修好了，人们又挖了二百六十多个鱼鳞坑，每个坑下面还修一个蓄水坝。尽管今年前一时期久雨不停，可是满山的水都被水库、鱼鳞坑、蓄水坝‘吃掉’了。”接着，陈兆凡又讲起这里的耕作情形：“去年冬天，用密犁套犁的方法，加深了三寸泥脚。12月间来了个‘人牛上山，坐山积肥’，我和二十多个社员在山上住了一个多月。田犁翻后每亩下了近二百担猪牛粪，铺上一层禾草、糠壳和树叶；第二次犁耙时，又一起放了一千六百担坑粪，挑进去近六千担漫沙泥；第三次又下三千担塘泥；第四次又下凼子肥、人粪、青肥等五千五百多担。几十年来被认为无法改造的瘠田，一下子变成了‘肉钵田’。有了肥又要治虫。这里年年受虫害。今年社员们说：古时有人用斧头劈山救母，我们的镰刀比他的斧头还利，要来个劈山治虫。组织了二十个‘劈山军’，把楼梯接架起来，用绳子捆着腰，一个个往高墈上爬。砍草时远一点的砍不到，把镰刀绑在长竹把上砍。只三天时间，砍光了三里多长、三丈多高山崖上的杂草，捣毁了虫窝。我们又制造了土药，发现虫子就治。社员艾友元用设陷阱、毒杀、假人、风梆、水梆许多办法，制服了这里的野兽和田鼠。今年插的南特号，很适宜土性；插3×7寸，密度适当。田间管理做得细致，又防止了倒伏。”
    说到这里，陈兆凡突然想起了一件事，感叹地说：“这块田往年处理的时候，总是个难题。可是如今变了样，公社力量真不小啊！”
    下午谷子收完了，记码员把数字总垅，一共一万五千二百八十七斤十二两，平均每亩收毛谷七百七十六斤。实收干谷一万二千二百一十四斤四两，平均每亩六百二十斤多一点，比去年早晚两季收成还增产39％强。何公公一把拉住孙书记的手，一字一板地说：“四十多年前，我在木底塘死了的这颗心，现在又活起来了。不光我老汉越活越年轻，连我作过三十年的‘败子田’也彻底翻了身。”（附图片）
