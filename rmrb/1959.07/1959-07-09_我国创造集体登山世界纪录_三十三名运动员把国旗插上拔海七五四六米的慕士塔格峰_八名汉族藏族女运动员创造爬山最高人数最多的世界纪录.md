Xinhua News Agency, Muztagh Ata, July 8th (Xinhua News Agency reporters Yang Kexian and Zhang Kecan) report: China's five-star national flag has been planted on the summit of Muztagh Ata Peak, a 7,546-meter-high mountain in the Pamir Plateau. At 6:20 PM Beijing time on July 7th, the thirty-three male and female mountaineers (eight women and twenty-five men) of the Chinese Mixed-Gender Muztagh Ata Mountaineering Team reached the summit of Muztagh Ata, known as the "Father of Ice Mountains," creating a world record for the largest number of mountaineers to collectively and safely ascend a mountain over 7,500 meters above sea level.

	Muztagh Ata is located on China's western border in Xinjiang. For many years, many people have attempted to climb it without success. It was not until July 31, 1956, that a joint Chinese-Soviet mountaineering team of thirty-one Chinese and Soviet male mountaineers successfully climbed the mountain for the first time, simultaneously setting a world record for the largest number of people to collectively and safely climb a mountain exceeding 7,500 meters above sea level. This time, the Chinese Mixed-Gender Muztagh Ata Mountaineering Team, after six days of marching, once again reached the summit of this mountain, setting a new world record.

	The entire Chinese Mixed-Gender Muztagh Ata Mountaineering Team arrived at the foot of the western side of Muztagh Ata on June 13th and began their climbing activities. They established a base camp at an altitude of 4,500 meters, a height difficult for ordinary people to reach. They conducted two high-altitude acclimatization marches, establishing Camp I and Camp II on the snow mountains at altitudes of 5,500 meters and 6,200 meters, respectively.

	The ascent to the main peak began on July 2nd. On the first day, they climbed from the base camp to Camp I near the snow line. On the second day, they advanced through strong winds and heavy snow, crossing many unfathomable ice and snow crevices and steep ice slopes, reaching Camp II. On the third day, due to a blizzard, they stayed at Camp II at an altitude of 6,200 meters. Overnight, the mountaineering team's tents were almost completely buried by the blizzard. On the fourth day, the snow lessened but the wind remained strong. The team members dug out their tents and advanced against the six to seven grade winds. Due to the strong wind, the team members had to lean their bodies into the wind to avoid being blown over. On this day, the team members established Camp III at an altitude of 6,800 meters. The next day, they continued to advance. Due to the extremely low air pressure and thin air at high altitudes, the team members expended a great deal of energy with each step, and began to experience headaches and occasional vomiting. The team members established Camp IV at an altitude of 7,200 meters.

	On the sixth day, July 7th, the weather on Muztagh Ata was clear. The team members departed at 11:15 AM Beijing time. They unloaded the baggage they had been carrying for days, carrying a national flag and some scientific instruments, and made a light assault on the summit. Because of the large number of people, it was 6:20 PM Beijing time when all thirty-three team members collectively reached the summit.

	During this mountaineering activity, another fourteen mountaineers reached altitudes of 6,800 meters, 7,000 meters, 7,200 meters, and 7,500 meters on Muztagh Ata.

Xinhua News Agency, Muztagh Ata, July 8th (Xinhua News Agency reporters Yang Kexian and Zhang Kecan) report: Among the Chinese Mixed-Gender Muztagh Ata Mountaineering Team, eight female mountaineers reached the summit of Muztagh Ata, 7,546 meters high, on the afternoon of July 7th. They not only set a world record for the highest altitude reached by female mountaineers, but also set a world record for the largest number of women to climb a mountain over 7,500 meters above sea level. (The previous world record for female mountaineering was 7,456 meters, set by the Frenchwoman C. Kogan when she climbed Ganesh Himal in the Himalayas from Nepal in 1955.) Of the eight Chinese female mountaineers who reached the summit of Muztagh Ata, four were Han and four were Tibetan. They are Zhou Yuying, Wang Yiqin, Cong Zhen, and Wang Guihua (all Han), and Xirao, Panduo, Qimi, and Zhamujin (all Tibetan). Their average age is only twenty-two, and the longest mountaineering history is only one year. Although they have short mountaineering histories and are young, they fully demonstrated their courage and strong will in the process of climbing Muztagh Ata. During the six-day climb, their physical strength was greatly depleted. In the last two or three days, they suffered from loss of appetite and vomiting due to altitude sickness, making it impossible to replenish their energy. However, they still braved the wind, snow, and severe cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius, and finally climbed to the summit together with the male mountaineers.

	During this mountaineering activity, Yuan Yang, the deputy leader of the Chinese Mixed-Gender Muztagh Ata Mountaineering Team and a female athlete, reached an altitude of 7,500 meters, also breaking the world record for female mountaineering altitude. Two other Tibetan female mountaineers, Haba Zhamujin and Chi Lai, also reached altitudes of 6,800 meters and 7,000 meters respectively, which are also heights rarely reached by female mountaineers in the world.

    我国创造集体登山世界纪录
    三十三名运动员把国旗插上拔海七五四六米的慕士塔格峰
    八名汉族藏族女运动员创造爬山最高人数最多的世界纪录
    新华社慕士塔格山8日电　新华社记者杨克现、张克灿报道：我国的一面五星国旗已经插上了帕米尔高原一座拔海七千五百四十六米的慕士塔格山顶峰。7月7日北京时间下午六点二十分，中国男、女混合慕士塔格登山队三十三名男、女登山运动员（女八人、男二十五人）攀登上了这座号称“冰山之父”的慕士塔格山顶峰，创造了登山队集体安全登上拔海七千五百米以上高山人数最多的世界纪录。
    慕士塔格山位于新疆西部边境。多少年来，许多人想登上去没有成功。直到1956年7月31日，中、苏混合登山队的三十一名中、苏男子登山队员第一次攀登这座高山时就获得成功，同时创造了集体安全地登上拔海超过七千五百米高山人数最多的世界纪录。这一次中国男、女混合慕士塔格登山队经过六天的行军，再一次登上这座高山顶峰，创造了新的世界纪录。
      中国男、女混合慕士塔格登山队全体人员于6月13日到达慕士塔格西面山下，开始了登山活动。他们在一般人难以到达的拔海四千五百米的高地建立了大本营基地。先后进行两次高山行军锻炼，分别在拔海五千五百米和六千二百米的雪山上建立了一号和二号高山营地。
      攀登主峰是从7月2日开始的。第一天自大本营攀登到雪线附近的第一号高山营地。第二天，冒着大风大雪前进，越过许多深不可测的冰雪裂缝和坡度很大的冰坡，到达了第二号高山营地。第三天因为狂风暴雪的袭击，在拔海六千二百米的第二号高山营地停留一天。一夜过后，登山队的帐篷差点被暴雪全部埋没。第四天雪小风大，队员刨开帐篷上的积雪，又冒着六、七级大风前进。因为风大，队员们前进时要把身体斜向着风，才不致被风刮倒。这一天，队员们在拔海六千八百米的地方建立了第三号高山营地。翌日继续前进，因为高空气压特低和空气稀薄，队员们每前进一步，体力消耗都很大，开始感到头痛，呕吐现象时有发生。队员们在拔海七千二百米的地方建立了第四号高山营地。
    第六天，7月7日，慕士塔格山天气晴朗。队员们在北京时间上午十一点一刻出发。他们卸去了连日来身上的行囊，携带着一面国旗和其他一些科学仪器，轻装向顶峰突击。因为人数众多，等到三十三名队员集体登上主峰时，已是北京时间下午六点二十分了。
    在这次登山活动中，另外还有十四名登山队员分别登上了慕士塔格山拔海六千八百米、七千米、七千二百米和七千五百米的高度。
    新华社慕士塔格山8日电　新华社记者杨克现、张克灿报道：中国男、女混合慕士塔格登山队中，有八名女子登山运动员在7月7日下午攀登上了七千五百四十六米的慕士塔格山顶峰。她们不仅在登山高度上创造了世界女子登山最高纪录，而且也创造了女子攀登拔海七千五百米以上高山人数最多的世界纪录。（世界女子登山最高纪录是七千四百五十六米，是法国人克·郭刚1955年由尼泊尔境内登上喜马拉雅山脉的加内什山峰时创造的。）登上慕士塔格山顶峰的我国这八名女子登山运动员中，汉族和藏族各四名，她们是周玉瑛、王义勤、丛珍、王贵华（以上汉族）、西绕、潘多、齐米、查母金（以上藏族）。她们的平均年龄只有二十二岁，登山历史最长的也只有一年。她们虽然登山历史短、年纪轻，但在攀登慕士塔格雪峰的过程中，充分表现了勇敢、坚强的意志。她们在六天的登山过程中，体力大大地消耗了，最后两三天又因高山反应而食欲不振和呕吐，不能补充体力的消耗，但她们仍然冒着摄氏零下二十多度的风雪严寒，终于同男子登山队员一起攀登到了顶峰。
    在这次的登山活动中，中国男、女慕士塔格登山队副队长、女运动员袁扬，达到了海拔七千五百米的高度，也打破了女子登山高度的世界纪录。还有两名藏族女子登山运动员哈巴查母金和尺来，也分别到达了六千八百米和七千米的高度，这也是世界女子登山运动员很少达到的高度。（附图片）
