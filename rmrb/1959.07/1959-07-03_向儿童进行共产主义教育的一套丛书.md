    A Series of Books for Communist Education of Children
  　Zhong Shaoxuan
    How to educate children in communism through reading materials? This is a question that many educators and workers for children are constantly concerned about.
    The "People with Communist Style" series recently published by the China Children's Publishing House is a new attempt in this regard, which is to tell children stories of communist style and noble ideological qualities through the deeds of advanced individuals and collectives.
    This series includes eight books: "Red Heart in the Blue Sea," "Treasure Hunting in Qu Mountain," "Fifteen Warriors Fight 'Divine Well'," "Heroic Women Under the White Emperor City," "Living Shen Nong," "Steel Commander," "Diamond in the Snow," and "'Emergency Doctor'," collecting nearly sixty stories in total. These stories are all true and touching.
    In "Red Heart in the Blue Sea," we see how the soldiers and militiamen defending the motherland bravely and tenaciously fight the enemy. After a No. 175 torpedo boat successfully sank an enemy warship, it was also injured and could not return to its position. The author meticulously describes the high patriotism of the captain and soldiers: they put the national flag in their arms, and with firm belief, they must swim back to the mainland of the motherland in the vast waves of the sea. When they were floating on the vast ocean, suffering from cold, hunger and illness, when they were struggling in the ocean and exhausted, they showed a noble spirit of class friendship. They overcame all kinds of unexpected difficulties and finally returned to the embrace of the motherland.
    In "Living Shen Nong," we see Yang Shenzichen, a young salesperson from the county supply and marketing cooperative, who accepted the task assigned to him by the Party to develop mountain resources, and climbed the steep Mount Wutai with his companions. They looked for wild plants in the deserted mountains, tasted various herbs themselves, relied on experienced old farmers, and constantly learned relevant botanical knowledge, and finally discovered many wild flowers and plants that can be used for wine making, oil extraction, and medicine making, opening up the treasure of Mount Wutai. More than 200 small comprehensive processing plants for winemaking, sugar making, paper making, oil extraction, and pesticides were established on Mount Wutai, and the poor mountain suddenly turned into a treasure mountain.
    The series also introduces many ordinary workers, some of whom are shop assistants, conductors, and feeders, and some are cooks, child care workers, and telephone operators, etc. They create great deeds in their ordinary work. "Heroic Women Under the White Emperor City," "Steel Commander," and "Treasure Hunting in Qu Mountain" mostly describe the stories of people in different positions who complete tasks excellently without fear of difficulties and without regard to rewards in their work.
    "'Emergency Doctor'" reflects the spirit of communist cooperation among people. "Collaboration Delivered to the Door" writes that when young worker He Gouhao was carrying out a technical innovation campaign in the factory, in order to help others process parts, his own number of innovation pieces fell behind. In a competition, the red flag on his lathe was taken away by others. After ideological struggle, he realized that the purpose of technical innovation was for socialist construction, and helping others was also for this purpose, so he more actively helped others. He Gouhao's selfless communist style is also taking shape in children. If someone's homework is behind, or if something difficult happens in someone's home, all the Young Pioneers and classmates enthusiastically come to help. Everyone is as happy about the slightest progress of others as they are about their own happy events.
    Generally speaking, the stories in this series are relatively touching, and the writing is relatively simple, but some are not written vividly and meticulously enough, and the writing is relatively dry, especially lacking the characteristics of children's reading materials. The illustrations and binding are also similar to general popular reading materials for adults.
    It is hoped that more of these children's reading materials will continue to appear, not only in greater quantity, but also in better quality!

    向儿童进行共产主义教育的一套丛书
  　钟绍萱
    怎样通过读物向孩子们进行共产主义教育？这是许多教育工作者、少年儿童工作者经常关心的问题。
    中国少年儿童出版社最近出版的“共产主义风格的人”丛书，在这方面作了新的尝试，就是通过先进人物和先进集体的事迹，向孩子们讲些共产主义风格和崇高的思想品质的故事。
    这套丛书包括“碧海红心”“曲山探宝”“十五勇士战‘神井’”“白帝城下女英豪”“活神农”“钢铁指挥员”“雪里金刚”“‘急诊医生’”等八本，共收集了将近六十个故事。这些故事都是真实而感人的。
    在“碧海红心”里，我们看到保卫祖国的战士和民兵是怎样英勇顽强地打击敌人。一艘一七五号鱼雷快艇胜利地打沉了敌人的军舰以后，自己也受伤不能返回阵地了。作者细致地描写了艇长和战士们高度的爱国主义精神：他们把国旗揣在自己的怀里，怀着坚定的信念在万顷波涛的大海里一定要游回祖国大陆。当他们飘浮在浩翰无垠的海洋上，受到寒冷、饥饿和病痛折磨的时候，当自己在海洋中挣扎得精疲力尽的时候，他们表现了高贵的阶级友爱精神。他们战胜了种种意想不到的困难，最后终于回到了祖国的怀抱。
    在“活神农”里，我们看到县供销社的年轻的营业员杨申子辰，接受了党交给他要开发山区资源的任务，和他的同伴爬上了险峻的五台山，在荒无人迹的山岭里寻找野生植物，他们亲尝各种草，依靠有经验的老农，不断学习有关植物学的知识，终于发现了许多能制酒、榨油、造药的野生花草，打开了五台山的宝藏。在五台山建立了二百多个酿酒、制糖、造纸、榨油、农药等小型综合加工厂，穷山一下子变成宝山。
    丛书里还介绍了不少普通劳动者，他们有的是营业员、售票员、饲养员，有的是炊事员、保育员、电话员，等等，他们在平凡的工作中创造着大事迹。“白帝城下女英豪”“钢铁指挥员”“曲山探宝”等几本书所描写的大都是不同岗位上的人们，在劳动中不避艰难，不计报酬而又出色地完成任务的故事。
    在“‘急诊医生’”里，是反映人们共产主义大协作精神的。“协作送上门”，写青年工人贺狗好在厂里开展技术革新运动的时候，为了帮助别人加工零件，自己的革新件数拉下了，在一次评比中，他的车床上的红旗被别人拿去了。经过思想斗争，认清了技术革新的目的是为了社会主义建设，帮助别人也是为了这个目的，于是他更积极主动地去帮助别人了。像贺狗好大公无私的共产主义风格，在孩子们身上也正在形成。谁的功课落后了，谁的家里发生了什么困难，全体少先队员和同学们都热情地来帮助，别人的些微进步，大家当成自己的喜事一样高兴。
    这套丛书，总的说来，故事比较动人，文字比较浅近，但有些还写得不够生动和细致，文字比较枯燥，特别是，缺乏儿童读物的特色。插图和装帧也同一般成人的通俗读物相似。
    希望继续出现这类儿童读物，不仅数量要更多，而且质量要更好！
