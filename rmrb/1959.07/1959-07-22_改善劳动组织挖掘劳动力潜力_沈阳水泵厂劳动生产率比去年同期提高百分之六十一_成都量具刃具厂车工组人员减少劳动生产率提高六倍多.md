Improve Labor Organization and Tap Labor Potential
    Shenyang Water Pump Factory's Labor Productivity Increased by 61% Compared with the Same Period Last Year
    Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutter Factory's Lathe Team Reduced Personnel and Increased Labor Productivity by More Than Six Times

    (Our Newspaper) News: In the Shenyang Water Pump Factory's increased production and thrift movement, they fully mobilized the masses, vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, improved labor organization, strengthened management, and accelerated the cultivation of technical reserves, so that labor productivity in the first half of this year increased by 61% compared with the same period last year. Originally, based on last year's average labor productivity level, completing the task for the first half of this year would have required more than two thousand additional laborers. Now, without increasing a single worker, they have overfulfilled the first half of the year's state plan by over four hundred and eighty-nine water pumps.

    In the first half of this year, the factory's total output value plan increased by more than one and a half times compared with the same period last year. Calculated according to last year's production level, completing this plan would require an increase of more than two thousand people, and equipment would also need to be greatly increased. However, the factory's leaders and employees, based on the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, and in the spirit of increasing production and practicing thrift, fully utilized people's subjective initiative and continuously improved labor productivity. Without increasing equipment and manpower, they produced more and better products than in the past. Taking March as an example, there was a 24% shortage of work hours and a shortage of more than twelve thousand machine hours. At the same time, they also faced difficulties such as insufficient materials, castings, and transportation capacity. Faced with these difficulties, the factory leaders mobilized the masses and, in the socialist emulation centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, with the goal of improving labor productivity, successively achieved ten high-yield (each production worker completed more than 150% of their quota), high-quality (eliminating defective products), and safe (eliminating accidents) workshop "all-red days", completing the first quarter's production task seven days ahead of schedule, and labor productivity increased by 7.2% compared to the highest month of last year.

    Mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in a planned and organized way is the most important method for this factory to improve labor productivity. In the first half of this year, the factory had a total of more than one thousand three hundred technical innovation proposals, of which more than eight hundred and thirty have been organized and implemented. Because technical innovation is closely centered on the key points of production, the direction is clear, and the method of collective research involving cadres, workers, and technicians is adopted, the implemented innovation projects have directly promoted current production and promoted the growth of labor productivity. For example, the more than eight hundred and thirty implemented suggestions can save the country more than two hundred thousand work hours throughout the year, save more than one hundred tons of metal materials, and significantly improve production efficiency and the degree of production mechanization.

    Improving labor organization and strengthening enterprise management is an important measure taken by this factory to improve labor productivity. Rationally improving labor organization according to production needs greatly reduced wasted work time and improved production efficiency. For example, when the third workshop was rushing to produce key equipment, the assembly line adopted flow-line operations, changing the past method of each person assembling a complete set, and the daily output increased by 290% compared to the previous highest daily record. Continuously strengthening enterprise management, especially grasping planning management, and doing a good job in short-term planning and dispatching work, avoided the waste caused by unbalanced equipment loads, which also created conditions for improving labor productivity.

    In addition, this factory also paid attention to accelerating the work of cultivating technical reserve forces. Methods such as one master teaching one apprentice or one master teaching multiple apprentices, organizing technical training classes, and organizing outstanding apprentice competitions were adopted to enable a large number of new workers to quickly improve their technical level and make them a vital force in improving labor productivity.

    In the entire process of continuously improving labor productivity, the factory leaders paid special attention to comprehensively improving the production level. From organizing competitions to inspecting production tasks, comprehensive indicators were stipulated. Therefore, while continuously improving labor productivity, the product quality of this factory also continuously improved. The actual defect rate in the first half of the year decreased by 0.09% compared with the plan, and it decreased month by month. In terms of safety, accidents also decreased month by month, and equipment accidents in June decreased by 30% compared with January.

    (Our Newspaper) News: The Youth Lathe Team of the Thread Ring Gauge Division of the Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutter Factory increased labor productivity by 6.33 times in the first half of this year compared with December of last year, reduced the scrap rate by 90%, reduced the consumption of tools and fixtures by 40.5%, and completed the workload for the entire year in half a year.

    This youth lathe team had a total of twenty-four people in December of last year, including several relatively capable masters. Since January of this year, due to production needs, nine people have been transferred out one after another, leaving only fifteen people, including ten apprentices. The technical strength has been greatly weakened, but the production tasks have increased month by month.

    Targeting the key problem of many apprentices and weak technical strength, this team first took measures to improve the technical level of the apprentices and ensure that the apprentices could charge into battle in the production struggle. They adopted the method of collective research and assigned responsibility, with the administrative team leader, trade union team leader, and Communist Youth League team leader jointly forming the core leading group. They organized the few technicians in the group to jointly study methods to improve the technical level of the apprentices through collective strength. Five technicians in the team were assigned to each lead two apprentices, responsible for imparting skills, and adopted the method of teaching and consolidating at the same time, gradually familiarizing themselves with operating techniques from simple to complex, from easy to difficult. The team's production plan was carefully arranged after full discussion. Technicians and apprentices both had production quotas, and if apprentices encountered any difficulties in operation, the masters would assist in solving them. When apprentices had outstanding achievements or advanced deeds in independent operation, the team would promptly organize everyone to learn from each other, exchange ideas, and encourage each other. When apprentice Wang Zongwu created the achievement of completing three days' worth of work in one day when rough turning thread ring gauges, the team immediately seized this example and launched a competition to have one person do the work of two, comparing who worked faster and who worked more skillfully, quickly forming a heat wave of studying technology and chasing each other.

    Racing against time and seizing progress is another characteristic of this lathe team's production. They never easily relaxed for a minute or a second. The masters attached great importance to the apprentices' preparations before production. They supervised or personally helped the apprentices prepare what work they needed to do each day and what tools and processed parts they needed in advance. Every time they changed a workpiece, they would also explain the process regulations, cutting specifications, and the use of tools to the apprentices to avoid problems during production and delay production time. Because this team focused on the training of apprentices, technical innovation, as well as production preparation work and plan arrangement. Since January of this year, although the production tasks have increased month by month, the production plan has been completed ahead of schedule every month, with the minimum being ten days ahead.

    While vigorously tapping potential and increasing output, the workers of this team paid special attention to improving product quality, achieving equal emphasis on output and quality. They knew deeply that if they did not pay attention to quality in the case of few people, low technical level, and increasing tasks month by month, it would likely cause rework and affect the completion of the task. Therefore, members of the core leading group often paid attention to educating apprentices to value quality, taught them the operating techniques to ensure quality, and strengthened the inspection of products. Because the entire team valued quality and established a strict inspection system, the scrap rate has dropped from 10% in December of last year to the current 1.6%, which is 0.4% lower than the factory's set scrap rate.

    改善劳动组织挖掘劳动力潜力
    沈阳水泵厂劳动生产率比去年同期提高百分之六十一
    成都量具刃具厂车工组人员减少劳动生产率提高六倍多
    本报讯　沈阳水泵厂在增产节约运动中，充分发动群众，大闹技术革新和技术革命，改善劳动组织，加强管理，加速培养技术后备力量，使今年上半年劳动生产率比去年同时期提高了61％。原来按去年平均劳动生产率水平，完成今年上半年的任务缺少两千余名劳动力，现在在不增加一名工人的条件下，超额四百八十九台水泵完成了上半年国家计划。
    今年上半年，这个厂的生产总值计划，比去年同时期增长一倍半以上。按去年的生产水平计算，要完成这个计划需要增加两千多人，设备也需大大增加。但是，这个厂的领导人和职工，根据去年大跃进的经验，本着增产节约的精神，充分发挥人们的主观能动作用，不断提高劳动生产率，在不增加设备和人力的条件下，生产出了比过去更多更好的产品。以3月份为例，工时缺24％，设备缺一万二千余台时，同时又面临着材料、铸件、运输能力不足等困难。在这些困难面前，工厂领导发动群众，在以技术革新和技术革命为中心、以提高劳动生产率为目标的社会主义竞赛中，先后出现了十个高产（每个生产工人都完成定额150％以上）、优质（消灭废品）、安全（消灭事故）的车间满堂红日，提前七天完成了第一季度生产任务，劳动生产率比去年最高月份还提高了7.2％。
    发动群众，有领导有计划地大闹技术革新与技术革命，是这个工厂提高劳动生产率的最主要的方法。今年上半年，全厂共出现了一千三百余项技术革新建议，已组织实现了八百三十余项。由于技术革新紧紧围绕生产关键，方向明确，同时采取干部、工人、技术人员参加的三结合的集体研究的方法，已实现的革新项目都直接推动了当前生产，促进了劳动生产率的增长。如已实现的八百三十余项建议，全年就可以给国家节省二十余万个工时，节约金属材料一百余吨，生产效率和生产机械化程度都显著提高。
    改善劳动组织，加强企业管理，是这个厂提高劳动生产率所采取的一项重要措施。根据生产需要合理改善劳动组织，大大减少了窝工，提高了生产效率。如三车间在突击赶制重点设备时，装配线上采用了流水作业法，改变了过去每人成台份的装配方法，日产量比过去日产最高纪录还提高了290％。不断加强企业管理，特别是抓了计划管理工作，做好短期计划和调度工作，避免了由于设备负荷不平衡所造成的浪费，这也给提高劳动生产率创造了条件。
    此外，这个厂还注意了加速培养技术后备力量的工作。采取一师一徒或一师多徒、组织技术训练班、组织优秀徒工竞赛等方法，使大批新工人迅速提高了技术水平，使他们成为提高劳动生产率的生力军。
    在不断提高劳动生产率的整个过程中，这个工厂的领导特别注意了全面提高生产水平。从组织竞赛到检查生产任务，都规定了全面的指标。因此，这个厂在不断提高劳动生产率同时，产品质量也不断提高。上半年实际废品率比计划降低了0.09％，而且是逐月降低。在安全方面，事故也逐月减少，设备事故6月份比1月份减少30％。
    本报讯　成都量具刃具厂量规分车间螺纹环规青年车工组，今年上半年和去年12月份比较，劳动生产率提高了六点三三倍，废次品率降低了90％，工卡具的消耗量降低了40.5％，用半年的时间，完成了全年的工作量。
    这个青年车工组去年12月份共有二十四人，其中有几个比较得力的师傅。今年1月份以来，由于生产的需要，陆续调走了九人，只剩下了十五个人，其中学工十人，技术力量是大大削弱了，可是生产任务却逐月增加。
    针对学工多，技术力量薄弱这个关键问题，这个组首先采取措施，提高学工的技术水平，保证学工能在生产战斗中，冲锋陷阵。他们采取了集体研究，分工包干的办法，由组内行政组长、工会组长和团小组长共同组成核心领导小组，把仅有的几个技工都组织起来，通过集体的力量，共同研究办法来提高学工的技术水平。组内五个技工分工每人带两个学工，负责传授技艺，采取边教边巩固的办法，由浅入深，由易到难，逐步熟悉操作技术。小组的生产计划是经过充分讨论后，再作周密安排的。技工和学工都有生产定额，学工操作中有什么困难，由师傅协助解决。学工们在独立操作中，一有出色的成就或先进事迹，组内就及时组织大家学习，互相交流，互相激励。学工王宗武在粗车削螺纹环规时，创造了一天完成三天工作量的成绩，组内立即抓住这个事例，发起一人顶两人的竞赛，比谁干得快，谁干得巧，很快形成了钻研技术，你追我赶的热潮。
    争时间，抢进度，是这个车工组生产中的又一个特点，他们从不轻易放松一分一秒的时间。师傅们非常重视学工们生产前的准备工作，每天要干一些什么活，需要什么工具和加工件，都事先督促或亲自动手帮助学工准备好。每换一个工件，也要向学工讲清楚工艺规程、切削规范和刀具的使用，以免在生产中发生问题，耽误生产时间。由于这个组抓紧了对学工的培训、技术革新以及生产准备工作和计划安排。从今年1月份起，尽管生产任务逐月增加，生产计划却逐月提前完成，最少的都是提前十天。
    这个组的工人在大挖潜力提高产量的同时，特别注意提高产品质量，作到产量质量并重。他们深知：在人少、技术水平低、任务又逐月增多的情况下，如果不注意质量，很可能造成返工，反而影响任务的完成。因此，核心领导小组的成员，经常注意教育学工重视质量，教会他们保证质量的操作技术，并且加强了产品的检验工作。由于全组都重视质量，又建立了严格的检查制度，废品率已由去年12月份的10％下降到现在的1.6％，比厂定废品率还低0.4％。
