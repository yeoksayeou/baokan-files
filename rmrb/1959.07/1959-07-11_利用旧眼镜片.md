    Utilizing Old Eyeglass Lenses
    Qiu Yuqiong from the Guiyang Railway Bureau writes to suggest the utilization of old eyeglass lenses. He says that there are many stalls selling old eyeglass lenses all over the country, but some customers are afraid to buy them because they are worried that the lenses may not be suitable. He suggests that local eyeglass companies collect the lenses from the stalls, test their diopters, and then label them with their intended use (myopia, presbyopia, astigmatism) before returning them to the stalls for sale. This would reassure customers.

    利用旧眼镜片
    贵阳铁路局丘毓璚来信，建议利用旧眼镜片。他说全国各地经售旧眼镜片的商摊很多，但有的顾客担心配得不合适，不敢问津。建议各地眼镜公司将商摊的镜片收集检验光度后，注明用途（近视、老光、散光）交还原商摊经售，这样顾客就放心了。
