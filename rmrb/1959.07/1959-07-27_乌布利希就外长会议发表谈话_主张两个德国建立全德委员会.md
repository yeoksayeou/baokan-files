Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 26th: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, spoke on television on the evening of the 25th regarding the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.

	Ulbricht said that since the two Germanys have participated in the Geneva conference on an equal footing, every sensible person expects the establishment of an All-German Committee by the two Germanys, so that at least negotiations can begin to discuss how to peacefully resolve the German question.

	Ulbricht pointed out that the Bonn government considers the proposal to establish an All-German Committee by representatives of the two Germanys to be the most dangerous thing at the Geneva conference. Ulbricht said that rejecting this proposal means rejecting the peaceful reunification of Germany. He said that Adenauer is deliberately trying to undermine the conclusion of a peace treaty and the peaceful reunification of Germany at all costs. The revanchist aggressive forces of German financial capital are plotting to launch a revanchist war. What they care about is armament, especially atomic armament. He also pointed out that Adenauer fears that the easing of the international situation will lead to the increasing isolation of the West German militarist group.

	Ulbricht said that linking the West Berlin issue with the German issue and establishing an All-German Committee were originally Western proposals, but when the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic brought it up at the conference, Herter said it was unacceptable. American foreign policy is truly rarely seen.

	Ulbricht accused Herter's speech on July 20 of being "basically consistent with the demands of the Adenauer government," and that Herter had turned himself into Adenauer's spokesperson.

	Ulbricht emphasized that now, it is impossible to discuss the German question at international conferences without the participation of the German Democratic Republic. He said that since the two Germanys participated in the Geneva conference on an equal footing, the United States, Britain, and France have actually recognized the existence of the two Germanys. Ulbricht warned the Western countries that the time has come to recognize reality and negotiate with the government of the German Democratic Republic, which consistently implements the Potsdam Agreement, for the sake of peace.

	Ulbricht said that since there are two different social systems in Germany, there must be equal cooperation between the two Germanys and the establishment of a confederation. The realistic and rational path to German reunification is to establish an All-German Committee and reach an understanding on the peace treaty issue.

	Ulbricht finally answered the question: What will happen if all efforts are unsuccessful and cannot lead to the normalization of the West Berlin situation and the conclusion of a peace treaty? Ulbricht said that at that time, the German Democratic Republic, together with the Soviet Union and the people of all countries willing to do so, will take the necessary measures on its own to normalize the situation in the interest of peace.

    乌布利希就外长会议发表谈话
    主张两个德国建立全德委员会
    据新华社柏林26日电　德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希25日晚上在电视广播中就日内瓦外长会议发表谈话。
    乌布利希说，自从两个德国平等地参加日内瓦会议后，每个明智的人都在期待两个德国建立全德委员会，以便至少可以开始谈判，来讨论如何和平解决德国问题。
    乌布利希指出，但是波恩政府认为在日内瓦会议上最危险的东西就是关于由两个德国的代表建立全德委员会的建议。乌布利希说，拒绝这个建议意味着拒绝和平统一德国。他说，阿登纳蓄意在任何条件下都要千方百计地破坏和约的缔结和德国的和平统一。德国财政资本的复仇主义侵略势力在打着发动复仇主义战争的算盘。他们关心的是武装，特别是原子武装。他还指出，阿登纳害怕国际局势的缓和从而导致西德军国主义集团日益孤立。
    乌布利希说，把西柏林问题和德国问题连在一起，成立全德委员会，原来都是西方自己的建议，但当苏联和德意志民主共和国把它提到会议上以后，赫脱却说不能接受。美国的外交政策真是稀奇少有的。
    乌布利希指责赫脱7月20日的发言“基本上和阿登纳政府的要求是一致的”，赫脱把自己变成了阿登纳的代言人。
    乌布利希着重说，现在，要在国际会议上讨论有关德国问题而没有德意志民主共和国参加是不行的了。他说，自从两个德国平等地参加了日内瓦会议以后，美国、英国和法国实际上是承认了两个德国的存在。乌布利希正告西方国家说，承认现实，为了和平的利益同一贯履行波茨坦协定的德意志民主共和国政府进行谈判的时候已经来到。
    乌布利希说，既然德国存在着两种不同的社会制度，两个德国之间就必须实行平等的合作并建立邦联。而德国重新统一的现实和理智的道路就是建立全德委员会和就和约问题达成谅解。
    乌布利希最后回答了这样一个问题：如果一切努力都不成功，不能导致西柏林局势正常化和缔结和约，那么将怎么办。乌布利希说，那时德意志民主共和国将同苏联以及愿意这样做的各国人民一道，自己采取必要的措施来使局面正常化，以有利于和平。
