    Camellia Girl Rao Xiuying
    By our reporter Zhou Rong
    As soon as I arrived at the Xiapu Commune's Xin Yanglin Farm in Hengshan, Hunan, I heard Secretary Lao Liu say: There is a 19-year-old woman named Rao Xiuying in the farm, known as the "Camellia Girl." People call her this because the high-yielding forest she cultivated and managed last year produced 547 jin of camellia oil per mu, making her a national camellia forestry model. This year, she and her team members are cultivating and managing the camellia trees even more carefully. The next day, I visited this "Camellia Girl" with excitement.
    In the early summer morning, the mountain tops and valleys were shrouded in a light, gauze-like white mist. Soon, the morning sun used its golden light to dispel the mist, and an endless green tea forest appeared before my eyes. At this time, the sound of "ding-dong" and "ding-dong" came from the hillside of Baiguo Garden. The commune members said that it was Rao Xiuying and her group reclaiming the tea mountain. I climbed up the hillside towards the sound, and sure enough, it was them. Standing at the front was Xiuying. She was wearing a floral short-sleeved shirt, her trousers rolled up to her thighs, and she was digging into the ground with a large hoe weighing more than three jin, "ka-cha," "ka-cha." With the hoe constantly rising and falling, the mountain soil turned over piece by piece. She was so energetic and efficient. Xiuying suddenly heard me calling her and quickly turned around to say hello. I saw sweat flowing down her full face, her hair sticking to the sweat, and her clothes already soaked.
    "You are working so hard!" I said.
    Xiuying replied with a cheerful and humble smile: "It's nothing. We are conducting a 12-mu high-yield experimental mountain this year, where we have already cultivated several times. This more than 400-mu tea mountain was only entrusted to us by the farm's Party branch this year. Since the Party thinks highly of us, we must manage it well, reclaim and cultivate it all once, so that it can produce more camellia oil this year." Then, she pointed to the top of the mountain and said: "To turn it over, we can only rely on our hands and hoes for the time being, digging it over one hoe at a time. Although the hoe is small and the mountain is big, we will swallow it bit by bit." At this time, I looked around the mountain and saw that two-thirds of the tea mountain had already been dug over by them. Xiuying said that they would be able to complete the reclamation by August.
    Then, Xiuying led me around to see the reclaimed tea mountain. Then we turned to the other side of the mountain to see their camellia high-yield experimental mountain. On the way, I asked her: "Xiuying, the sisters in your women's team are all so energetic and united in reclaiming and cultivating camellia. Was it like this from the beginning?" She shook her head and said: "No, there were many difficulties at the beginning, but these difficulties have been overcome by us." Then she recalled the past.
    This 16-member women's team was only established as a professional camellia production team after transplanting rice seedlings this spring. They are all between 17 and 18 years old, and only one is over 20. Xiuying, who is 19, can be considered the second oldest sister. She is a member of the Communist Youth League, works actively, and has experience in cultivating high-yielding camellia trees last year. Everyone elected her as the captain. From this moment on, she took on the responsibility. She discussed it with everyone, and on the one hand, she wanted to do a good job in the 12-mu high-yield camellia mountain, and at the same time, she wanted to fully reclaim the 400-mu camellia forest entrusted to them by the farm's Party branch. At that time, team members Lin Pingqing and Lin Yue'e suddenly became silent, with clouds of worry on their faces. Yingxiu knew that they must have something on their minds, so she worked with them to reclaim wasteland during the day and slept together to talk at night. Xiuying discovered that they had listened to others who said that engaging in camellia production would not be "promising" and would even turn them into "hunchbacks." In response to this situation, Xiuying said to them: "Although I cultivated the tea forest seriously last year, I still didn't do enough, but the Party still called me to Beijing to meet Chairman Mao, who said it wasn't promising. At the same time, there are generations of people here who have reclaimed tea mountains, and their bodies are all strong, and no one has become a hunchback. Good sisters, don't listen to those nonsense!" Pingqing and Yue'e were inspired by these words, saw a bright future, and their hearts were filled with joy. The sixteen people were united, their goals were consistent, and their enthusiasm was even greater.
    One evening, Xiuying called everyone together and happily told them that the farm had decided to launch a red flag competition between teams, and the fourth professional team had proposed to compete on work efficiency, progress, and quality. "Everyone, tell me, do we dare to accept the challenge?" Everyone said: We dare! Xiuying considered that it would be impossible to win by simply competing head-on, so she and everyone came up with some ways to improve. The next day, they changed the way they used to dig mountains, using a flat-mouthed, long-handled hoe to dig old thatch mountains, which was deeper and faster, and using a wide-mouthed hoe to dig tender thatch mountains. At the same time, they also launched a competition among themselves. On this day, they achieved a great victory, increasing the average daily digging from six fen of mountain per person to nine fen, and the quality was also good. They were almost the same as the fourth professional team.
    Crossing Daye Ridge, we entered the camellia high-yield experimental mountain. The heavy camellia fruits weighed down the branches. Not a single blade of grass could be found in this tea mountain. Xiuying said that this year, it had not only been cultivated twice, but also green manure and fermented fine manure had been applied to the edges of the tea mounds. There was a water storage pit on the upper side of each tea tree, which was a creation to supply the tea trees with water. Generally speaking, there are many ants and pests on tea trees, but there are almost none of these insects here. It is said that there were indeed many ants during the first cultivation. Xiuying and her team brought a large brazier from home and placed it under the tree mounds, then climbed the tea trees and used their hands to grab the ants, nests and all, and burn them in the brazier, then sprayed the tree mounds with lime water and "666" solution, so that the insects would not dare to come again. Some of the girls were originally afraid of being bitten by ants, but when they saw Xiuying so bravely exterminating insects, they all bravely got involved. The water, soil, fertilizer, and conservation of this mountain are so solid and meticulous in every aspect. At this time, Xiuying pointed to a tea tree and told me that this tree had more than 3,000 camellia fruits. She pointed to another ordinary tree and said that this tree had more than 1,300 camellia fruits. From these fruit-laden camellia forests, we can see the great camellia harvest that is about to be realized. (Attached photo)

    油茶姑娘饶秀英

    刚到湖南衡山夏浦公社新杨林场，就听到秘书老刘说：林场里有个十九岁的妇女队长饶秀英，美称“油茶姑娘”。人们这样称呼她，是因为她在去年培育管理的丰产林，亩产油茶五百四十七斤，当了全国油茶林业模范。今年，她和队员们把油茶树培育管理得更精细。第二天，我怀着兴奋心情访问这位“油茶姑娘”。
    初夏的早晨，山头和山谷、笼罩着一层轻纱般似的白色薄雾。稍息，朝阳用它的金光把雾驱散了，眼前出现了望不到边的绿色茶林。这时，从白果园半山腰，传来了“叮冬”“叮冬”的声音，社员们说那正是饶秀英一伙人在垦复茶山。我朝着响声方向爬上了半山腰，定眼一看，正是她们。站在最前边的就是秀英。他穿着花格短袖子衣，裤脚卷在大腿上，拿着三斤多重的大锄“卡喳”“卡喳”向地头挖去，随着锄头不断起落，山土一块连一块地翻了转来。她是那么有劲、麻利。秀英突然听到我的喊声，便连忙回过头来打招呼。只见她那丰满的脸上流着汗水，头发和汗水沾在一起，衣服已经浸湿了。
    “你们干劲真大呀！”我说。
    秀英欢笑谦虚地回答：“没什么，我们今年搞了十二亩丰产试验山，那里已中耕多次了。这边四百多亩茶山是林场党总支今年才叫我们管理的。党看得起我们，我们就要一定把它管好，把它全部垦复培育一次，叫它当年就可多产茶油”。接着，她指着山头说：“要把它翻转来，目前就只得靠我们双手和锄头，一锄一锄地把它挖过来。锄头虽小，山虽大，可是我们会一口一口地把它吞掉”。这时，我环瞩山头，只见有三分之二的茶山，已被她们挖转来了。秀英说，在8月以前，能全部垦完。
    接着，秀英就领着我到处看看垦复过来的茶山。然后翻到山的那边，去看看她们的油茶丰产试验山。在路上我问她：“秀英，你们妇女专业队姊姊妹妹垦复培育油茶个个劲头都那么大，又是那么齐心，一开头就是这样吗？”她把头一摇地说：“不，开头是有很多困难的，但是这些困难都被我们克服了。”她于是回顾起以往的情况来。
    这个十六人的妇女队，是在今春插秧以后才确定专业搞油茶生产的。她们年龄都在十七、八岁，二十岁开外的只有一个，十九岁的秀英算称得上二姐了。她是共青团员，工作积极、又有去年培植油茶高产经验，大家选她做了队长。从这时候起，她就把担子挑了起来。她和大家商量了一番，一面要把十二亩丰产油茶山搞好，同时要把林场党总支交给管理的四百亩油茶林，全面垦复一次。那时，队员林萍清、林月娥两人，一下变得沉默起来，脸上罩着愁云。英秀知道她们两人一定有心事，于是就同她俩白天在一起垦荒，晚上睡在一起谈心。秀英发现她们两人听了别人的话，说什么搞油茶“出息”不大，还会挖成“驼子”。秀英针对这种情况便对她说：“我去年虽认真培植了茶林，但还做得很不够，党就叫我上北京见了毛主席，谁说出息不大。同时，这里有世世代代垦复茶山的人，身体都是结结实实，没有一人成驼子。好妹妹，别听那些胡说吧！”。萍清、月娥从这些话里得到了启发，看到了美好前途，心里顿时欢笑了起来。十六个人心齐了，目标一致了，干劲也更大了。
    一天晚上，秀英把大家喊到一起，高兴地告诉大家，林场决定队与队之间展开红旗竞赛，第四专业队提出了比工效、比进度、比质量。“大家说说，我们妇女队敢应战不？”大家都说：敢！秀英考虑到硬比是比不赢的，于是和大家一起想出一些改进的办法。第二天她们就改变了过去挖山的办法，把挖老茅山改用了仄口长形锄头，挖的深，进度快，挖嫩茅山的，就改用宽口锄头。同时，她们之间也展开了竞赛。这一天，旗开得胜，每人平均每天由挖六分山提高到九分山，质量也好。她们几乎和第四专业队一样。
    翻过大叶岭，就进入了油茶丰产试验山。累累的茶桃压得树枝驼了下来。这块茶山里找不到一根草。秀英说，这里今年不但中耕过两次，而且在茶兜边施下了青肥和沤制的细肥。每个茶树一旁的上边，都有个蓄水坑，这是供给茶树需水的一项创造。一般说来，茶树上的蚂蚁和害虫很多，可是这里几乎没有这些虫子。据说在第一次中耕时，蚂蚁确实不少。秀英她们便从家里提来个大火盆，放在树兜下，然后爬上茶树用手把蚂蚁连窝抓到火盆烧掉，然后用石灰水和“六六六”水喷在树兜上，这样虫子就不敢再来了。有些姑娘原来怕蚂蚁咬，见秀英那么勇敢灭虫，她们也都奋勇地搞起来了。这块山的水、土、肥、保就是如此搞得项项都那么扎实，那么精细。这时，秀英手指着一棵茶树，告诉我，这个树结了三千多个茶桃。她又指着另一棵属于一般的树说，这棵树结了一千三百多个茶桃。我们从这些结果累累的油茶林中，看到将要实现的油茶大丰收。（附图片）
