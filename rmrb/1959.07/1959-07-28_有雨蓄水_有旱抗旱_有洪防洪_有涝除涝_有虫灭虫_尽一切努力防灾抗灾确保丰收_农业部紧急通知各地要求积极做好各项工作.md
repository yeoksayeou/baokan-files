Xinhua News Agency, July 27th -- The Ministry of Agriculture issued an emergency notice on disaster prevention and resistance, requiring agricultural departments in various regions to do a good job in disaster prevention and resistance, overcome all possible natural disasters, and ensure a bumper harvest.

    The notice stated that July, August, and September are the months when natural disasters, especially floods and droughts, occur more frequently. In the previous period, relatively serious floods had occurred in Guangdong and other places. In recent days, there has been more rainfall in northern Hebei and Shanxi, and western Liaoning. The drought situation in most areas of Henan, Hubei, and Hunan, and parts of Shaanxi, Anhui, and other places has worsened. In order to effectively prevent and resist disasters, the notice requires agricultural departments in various regions to mobilize, immediately restore, establish and strengthen disaster prevention and resistance command organizations, and organize disaster prevention and resistance teams. Considering the worst-case scenario and striving for the best outcome, overcoming complacency, and actively making all necessary preparations. According to different situations, store water when it rains, fight drought when it's dry, prevent floods when there are floods, and eliminate waterlogging when there is waterlogging.

    The notice requires all regions to carefully inspect various flood control projects in terms of flood prevention and drainage, and if any collapses, cracks, or incomplete water discharge equipment are found, they should be reinforced and repaired in a timely manner to improve flood prevention and drainage capabilities. Projects under construction should be protected and temporary flood discharge measures should be taken to ensure project safety, reservoirs do not collapse, and dikes do not break. At the same time, drainage and waterlogging prevention facilities should be improved to prevent waterlogging disasters. For the large autumn crops growing in the fields, cultivation and weeding should be stepped up to eliminate weeds. Mature crops, such as early rice and spring wheat, should be harvested in a timely manner to prevent mold and loss.

    Regarding drought prevention and resistance, the notice pointed out that the south is now in the period of heading, flowering, and filling for mid-season rice, and the rush to transplant late rice. The north is also in the season when large autumn crops need more water. We must seize the time to prevent and resist drought to ensure water for crop growth. We must give full play to the role of existing irrigation projects, carry out irrigation rationally, save water, and expand the area of benefit. In areas with insufficient water sources, we must open up water sources in many ways, intercept river water, dig mountain springs, intercept undercurrents, and build canals and wells. The use of water lifting tools should be organized in a planned way, and damaged tools should be quickly repaired. All existing water lifting tools should be used, and the masses should be mobilized to vigorously produce simple water lifting tools, so that there are tools for every water lifting project. At the same time, agricultural measures such as loosening the soil to conserve moisture and covering with grass should be taken to resist drought and protect seedlings; seedlings that cannot be transplanted for the time being should be protected, and measures should be taken to delay transplanting or foster seedlings.

    The notice requires all regions to seize the work of pest control. The notice stated that July and August are the peak seasons for various pests due to high temperatures and humidity. Preparations should be made in advance, and frequent inspections and prevention should be carried out. Act swiftly and skillfully to eliminate pests in the early stages. Locust-affected areas should quickly organize forces to eliminate autumn locusts before the beginning of August. Rice-growing areas should focus on preventing rice blast, rice planthoppers, leafhoppers, and rice stem borers. Grain-growing areas should focus on preventing corn borers, armyworms, sorghum aphids, and potato late blight. Cotton-growing areas should focus on preventing bollworms, pink bollworms, cutworms, and leafhoppers, and other pests during the budding and boll stage. Special attention should be paid to the control of generalist pests such as beet armyworms, and they should be eliminated in the spot stage. Soil-based pesticides and machinery should be used as much as possible for prevention and control, and existing chemical pesticides should be used in a timely manner to eliminate various major diseases and insect pests. All regions should adjust and supply agricultural machinery and pesticides in a timely manner according to needs. She and team which use highly toxic pesticides should strictly implement the responsibility management system, do a good job in the inspection and repair of drug machinery, and prevent poisoning of people and animals.

    农业部紧急通知各地要求积极做好各项工作
    新华社27日讯　农业部发出关于防灾抗灾的紧急通知，要求各地农业部门作好防灾抗灾工作，战胜一切可能到来的自然灾害，确保丰收。
    通知说，7、8、9三个月是自然灾害特别是水旱灾害发生较多的时候，前一时期，广东等地已发生比较严重的水灾，最近几天，河北和山西北部、辽宁西部雨水较多，河南、湖北、湖南的大部地区，陕西、安徽等地部分地区的旱象又有发展。为了有效地防灾抗灾，通知要求各地农业部门必须动员起来，立即恢复建立和加强防灾抗灾的指挥机构，组织防灾抗灾队伍。从最坏处着想，向最好处努力，克服麻痹思想，积极做好一切应有的准备工作。根据不同情况，做到有雨蓄水，有旱抗旱，有洪防洪，有涝除涝。
    通知要求各地在防洪防涝方面，要认真检查各项防洪工程，如发现有坍坡裂缝及泄水设备不齐全等情况，应当及时加固补修，提高防洪防涝能力。正在施工的工程，要做好防护工作和临时泄洪措施，保证工程安全，库不倒坝，堤不决口。同时要做好排渍防涝设施，防止沥涝成灾。对正在田间生长的大秋作物，要加紧中耕、锄草，消灭草荒。已经成熟的作物，如早稻、春麦等应当及时抢收，防止霉烂损失。
    关于防旱抗旱，通知指出，目前南方正是中稻抽穗、扬花、灌浆和抢插晚稻的时期，北方也正是大秋作物需水较多的季节，必须抓紧防旱抗旱，确保作物生长用水。要充分发挥现有灌溉工程的作用，合理进行灌溉，节约用水，扩大受益面积。在水源不足的地区，要多方面开辟水源，拦引河水，挖山泉，截潜流，修渠打井。有计划地组织提水工具的使用，损坏了的应赶紧组织修复，把已有的提水工具全部利用起来，发动群众大力赶制简易提水工具，达到每一处提水工程都有工具。同时，要采取松土保墒、盖草等农业措施抗旱保苗；暂时没有水插秧的要保护好秧苗，采取延迟插秧或寄秧的办法。
    通知要求各地抓紧防治虫害的工作。通知说，7、8月份气温高，湿度大，正是各种害虫盛发时期，要预先作好准备，勤检查，勤防治，猛攻巧打，把害虫消灭在初生阶段。蝗区要迅速组织力量于8月上旬以前消灭秋蝗。水稻区要着重防治稻瘟病、稻飞虱、浮尘子、稻螟虫。杂粮区要着重防治玉米螟、粘虫、高粱蚜、马铃薯晚疫病。棉区要着重防治棉铃虫、红铃虫、金钢钻、叶跳虫等蕾铃期害虫。对于杂食性的害虫斜纹夜盗蛾尤其要抓紧防治，消灭在点片阶段。能用土药械防治的要尽量使用土药械防治，现有的化学农药要及时使用到消灭各种主要病虫害方面。各地应根据需要，适时做好农药械调剂供应工作。使用剧毒农药的社、队要严格责任管理制度，做好药械检修工作，防治人畜中毒。
