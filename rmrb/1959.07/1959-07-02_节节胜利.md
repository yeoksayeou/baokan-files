    Victory After Victory
      "Bumper harvests every season, abundant harvests of all grains," this is the most fundamental requirement for agricultural production. The You County Party Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, timely and loudly put forward the bumper harvest slogans for each farming season and each crop, and led the masses to take corresponding effective measures to increase production, so that the mass movement to seize bumper grain harvests rose one after another. Only by interlocking like this can we ensure that we achieve an increase in total grain production. They clearly recognized this point: seizing total production cannot rely solely on one season or one crop, but must be attacked season by season, fought item by item, seizing one season to plant well, and seizing one item to plant well. Strive for victory after victory, and in the end, we will achieve a comprehensive victory.

    节节胜利
      “季季丰产，五谷丰登”，这是农业生产最根本的要求。攸县县委根据湖南省委的指示，及时地、响亮地提出每个农事季节、每项作物的丰产口号，领导群众相应采取有效的增产措施，使夺取粮食丰产的群众运动，一个高潮接着一个高潮。这样环环紧扣，才能保证达到增加粮食总产量。他们明确地认识了这一点：夺取总产量不能单靠一季或某一项作物，而要一季一季地攻，一项一项地打，抓住一季种好一季，抓住一项种好一项。争取节节胜利，最后才会全面告捷。
