Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: Speech by Vietnamese Ambassador to China Tran Tu Binh at the Capital's People's Meeting Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the Geneva Accords and Supporting Vietnam's Peaceful Reunification.
Comrade Chairman, Comrades, Friends:

　　Five years ago today, after the Vietnamese people had carried out eight or nine years of heroic resistance, and on the basis of the historic Dien Bien Phu victory, the Geneva Accords were signed. This agreement halted the war of aggression by the French imperialists and American interventionists in Indochina and proposed solutions to prevent the recurrence of war and address various political issues, based on respect for the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

　　The Geneva Accords conformed to the peaceful aspirations of all the Vietnamese people and were also conducive to maintaining peace and security for the people of Southeast Asia and the world. Therefore, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has not only consistently respected and strictly implemented the provisions of the Geneva Accords but has also actively proposed to the South Vietnamese authorities many positive measures aimed at easing the situation, creating conditions for mutual contact and understanding between the two sides, and then jointly resolving Vietnam's political issues.

　　In particular, in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords to resolve political issues, and to adapt to the urgent desire of all the Vietnamese people, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote to the South Vietnamese authorities five times from 1955 to 1958, suggesting convening a consultative conference to discuss holding free general elections to unify the country. In principle, all matters related to the general election would be fully resolved by both sides through consultation, mutual concessions, and understanding, and no one would annex the other.

　　When the South Vietnamese authorities expressed an attitude of denying the Geneva Accords and refusing to consult on the general election, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requested the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to intervene more than once; on the other hand, it still adhered to its position, made various efforts, and actively put forward many specific and practical, reasonable proposals in open letters sent to the South Vietnamese authorities on March 7 and December 22, 1958.

　　Conversely, under the instigation of the United States, the South Vietnamese authorities have consistently adopted a policy of undermining the Geneva Accords and attempting to permanently divide Vietnam. They have used all kinds of poisonous means to persecute and massacre the people, turning South Vietnam into a U.S. military base and preparing for a new war. Therefore, they ignored all the suggestions of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding consultations for the general election. They also rejected the suggestion to restore normal relations between the two regions.

　　From the end of 1955, they cut off free passage through the provisional military demarcation line, trying to turn the provisional military demarcation line into a permanent border dividing Vietnam. This action completely violated the provisions of the final declaration of the Geneva Accords: "The military demarcation line is a provisional line and cannot be interpreted in any way as a political or territorial boundary." Subsequently, they also took a series of measures aimed at making South Vietnam a separate country, such as holding unilateral elections and establishing a so-called "Constituent National Assembly," and promulgating a fascist dictatorial "Constitution."

　　For five years, under the guise of "military assistance" and the cliché of "defending Vietnam's freedom," U.S. imperialism has helped the South Vietnamese authorities build a standing armed force of 355,000 troops, including regular army, security regiments, and civil guard teams. In addition, U.S. imperialism has illegally transported various weapons, ammunition, and war materials into South Vietnam 380 times; by June 1959, it had sent 51 delegations to South Vietnam, including generals and commanders of various services, as well as senior military and diplomatic officials. Military bases are increasing in South Vietnam. There were only six airports during the war, but today, in peacetime, that number has increased to twenty-one, five of which meet "international standards." Since 1957, the United States has been stepping up the establishment of a strategic highway system in South Vietnam. This highway system can be connected to southern Laos and one of the member states of the Southeast Asia Military Group—Thailand.

　　In April of this year, the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities signed a so-called "Agreement on Cooperation in the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy," which is a trick played by the United States in an attempt to transport atomic weapons into South Vietnam.

　　On the other hand, the United States has tried every possible means to drag South Vietnam into the "Southeast Asia Military Aggression Group." U.S. imperialism, disregarding the provisions of the Geneva Accords, blatantly placed South Vietnam under the "protection" of this military group. In recent years, the South Vietnamese authorities have also participated in the military meetings and military exercises held by this military group as an "observer." Recently, South Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos, and the United States signed bilateral agreements under the false banners of "cooperation," "peace," and "friendship." The above-mentioned facts have become strong evidence accusing South Vietnam of actually colluding with the Southeast Asia Military Aggression Group.

　　For five years, South Vietnam has actually become a springboard for the United States to implement its intervention policy and provoke wars in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The South Vietnamese regime representatives even directed and assisted rebels in Phnom Penh in an attempt to overthrow the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia. They also sent lackeys to Laos to engage in espionage activities and engaged in harassment on the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It can be seen that all the activities of the South Vietnamese authorities, who betrayed the Geneva Accords, and the Sananikone government, which provoked a civil war in Laos, are part of the U.S. imperialist aggression plan, the purpose of which is to create tension in the Indochina region, and then prepare for the Southeast Asia Military Aggression Group to easily carry out blatant intervention.

　　The Vietnamese nation, a nation that fought heroically in the eight or nine years of resistance, enduring all sacrifices to defend peace, independence, unity, and democracy, will certainly not allow U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to arbitrarily infringe upon national independence, undermine the unity of the motherland, and provoke new wars. In order to realize its ambitions, U.S. imperialism has openly pointed out a line to the South Vietnamese authorities: "South Vietnam needs a strong government relying on the police and gendarmerie forces." In addition, the South Vietnamese authorities have adopted bloody suppression and retaliation measures as their "national policy" against South Vietnamese patriots, regardless of class, party, or religion. In particular, the South Vietnamese authorities have taken unusually barbaric and cruel persecution and retaliation measures against former resistance personnel and their families, which seriously violate Article 14, Paragraph C of the Geneva Accords.

　　The persecution policy of the South Vietnamese authorities is specifically manifested in hundreds of large and small massacres and "sweeps" of patriots by armed forces including the army, police, security regiments, and civil guard teams, which they call "anti-communist campaigns" or "sweeping campaigns." They sweep back and forth, sometimes for several months in an area hundreds of kilometers wide. They arrest and abuse people, rape women, kill people and set fires, and loot everywhere, which is no different from the crimes committed by the French colonial army during the war of aggression. The most typical example is the large-scale "sweeping" in the Bien Hoa area in the first few months of this year. In addition to mobilizing tens of thousands of regular troops, they also sent dozens of aircraft to bomb and kill innocent residents. To this day, this "sweeping" is still continuing to expand.

　　In just five years, they have created more than 7,000 bloody incidents that have developed from sporadic persecution to collective massacres. Tens of thousands of former resistance personnel and patriots have been imprisoned in concentration camps, and many villages have been destroyed, like the Huong Dien massacre.

　　On December 1 last year, more than 1,000 people were poisoned to death in the Phu Loi concentration camp. This massacre is a typical manifestation of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime's implementation of its fascist massacre policy. This barbaric massacre aroused great anger among all the Vietnamese people and peace-loving, justice-upholding people around the world.

　　Under the name of the "University of Michigan Delegation," the United States sent many advisors to assist the South Vietnamese authorities in establishing police organizations and a large number of concentration camps, and taught so-called "scientific" torture techniques. In today's South Vietnam, it is not difficult to find a concentration camp like the "Sino-American Special Technical Cooperation Organization" once established by Chiang Kai-shek. There, there is not only one, but more than twenty concentration camps with considerable scale and system, and their tyranny is no less than that of the concentration camps established by the Chiang Kai-shek gang.

　　In May of this year, the South Vietnamese authorities promulgated the "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959," which stipulates the establishment of a "Special Military Court," an unprecedentedly barbaric legal system that rudely infringes upon the basic freedoms of being human and violates the most common legal standards.

　　The above-mentioned typical events created by the South Vietnamese authorities in the past show that their dictatorial policy has begun to enter a new stage of development: that is, they are embarking on a path of extreme isolation and must use large-scale military operations, promulgate fascist decrees, and adopt the most despicable assassination methods against the people.

　　Due to the U.S. imperialists and the South Vietnamese authorities implementing policies of undermining the Geneva Accords and provocation, although peace has been restored for five years, and the time stipulated in the Geneva Accords has passed for three years, the national unification through free general elections has not yet been realized. The state of division has been delayed for five years, leaving an unhealed wound in the hearts of every patriotic Vietnamese. Tens of thousands of families in the two regions are still separated; husbands and wives, mothers and children, and close relatives cannot be reunited. In South Vietnam, nearly 200,000 people have been killed or injured or are being imprisoned in dark prisons. People's lives and property are not guaranteed. Due to the monopoly of U.S. imperialism, the South Vietnamese economy is increasingly suffocated, and the lives of the vast majority of South Vietnamese people are increasingly plunged into poverty: unemployment, hunger, and various social ills are increasingly developing.

　　For five years, the people of South Vietnam have recognized the harm of U.S. imperialism's intervention in South Vietnam, and they have continuously held high the banner of peaceful unification of the motherland. In North Vietnam, the Vietnamese people have been and are doing their best to consolidate all aspects of their work. They are concentrating their efforts on peaceful construction, laying a solid foundation for the unification of the country. Facing the behavior of U.S. imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities in undermining and trampling on the Geneva Accords, the people of North Vietnam are even more united, united as one, exposing the sinister conspiracies and barbaric crimes of U.S. imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities. They demand that the U.S.-Ngo clique must immediately stop bloody suppression and the use of retaliatory measures.

　　Just like the people of North Vietnam, the people of South Vietnam's urgent desire for peace and unification of the motherland has taken root in everyone's heart, which cannot be blocked by any force. Despite the South Vietnamese authorities' adoption of various barbaric means of suppression and persecution, the people of South Vietnam still bravely stood up to wage irreconcilable struggles against forced conscription, against pulling coolies to build military bases, and against the South Vietnamese authorities' traitorous and harmful acts of forcing people to relocate and demolishing houses to build strategic highways. On the "May Day" International Labor Day in 1958, 500,000 people in the Saigon-Cholon area held demonstrations, demanding peace, unification, restoration of normal relations between the two regions, improvement of living standards, and democratic freedoms. Comrades, friends, the enslavement, persecution, and provocation policies of U.S. imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities cannot suppress the South Vietnamese people's desire for peaceful unification. On the contrary, it has promoted the increasing unity of people from all walks of life, becoming a magnificent force to defend the motherland and their own living rights.

　　The Vietnamese people demand that the U.S. military delegation withdraw from South Vietnam, that the South Vietnamese authorities must abandon their policy of slavishly following U.S. imperialism, that they should immediately stop strengthening their armaments and preparing for war, end the persecution and retaliation policies against former resistance personnel and patriots, and guarantee their various freedoms and democratic rights. The South Vietnamese authorities must hold consultations with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to discuss the issue of conducting free general elections throughout the country, thereby realizing the unification of Vietnam. In order to create favorable conditions for the above-mentioned matters, the two regions should restore normal relations.

　　For five years, the just struggle of the Vietnamese people has won the sympathy and support of the world's peace and democratic forces and the socialist camp, which is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people in their struggle to achieve peaceful unification of the motherland.

　　The governments and people's organizations of various socialist countries, headed by the Soviet Union, have consistently and enthusiastically supported the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's position in struggling for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords. The people of the world who love peace and justice, and the governments and people of many Asian and African countries, have expressed their sympathy for the just cause of the Vietnamese people on many occasions and emphasized the need to continue to implement the Geneva Accords. The decision of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to designate July 20—the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords—as "Vietnam Day" is of great significance and fully demonstrates the sympathy and support of the people of Asian and African countries for the Vietnamese people in their struggle for national unification and against U.S. interventionists.

　　The Chinese people and the Chinese government are the closest comrades-in-arms and loyal comrades of the Vietnamese people and have always been concerned about and fully supported the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence and unification. At the same time, China is a participant in the Geneva Conference, has made important contributions to the success of the conference, and has continuously struggled for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords. This makes the Vietnamese people feel excited and strengthens their fighting power in the struggle for peaceful unification of the motherland. On this occasion, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the comrades who participated in today's meeting on behalf of the Vietnamese people, and through you, express my heartfelt thanks to the fraternal Chinese people.

　　The warm sympathy and support of the people all over the world has deeply moved the Vietnamese people, thereby strengthening their conviction that their struggle will surely be victorious. The Vietnamese people recognize that they have increased many friends in the cause of peaceful unification of the motherland, and the dawn of justice covers the shadow of the reactionary forces that are dying out.

　　The Vietnamese people will surely win the final victory, and Vietnam will surely be unified.

    越南人民争取统一的斗争必定胜利
    越南驻华大使陈子平在首都各界人民大会上的讲话
    新华社20日讯　越南驻华大使陈子平在首都各界人民纪念日内瓦协议五周年、支持越南和平统一大会上的讲话。主席同志、同志们、朋友们：
    就在越南人民进行了八、九年的英勇抗战之后，在具有历史性的奠边府战役胜利的基础上，距今五年前的今天，签订了日内瓦协议。这个协议制止了法帝国主义和美国干涉者在印度支那的侵略战争，并提出了在尊重越南、柬埔寨和老挝的独立、主权、统一和领土完整的基础上，防止战争再起，并对各项政治问题作出解决的办法。
      日内瓦协议是符合于全体越南人民的和平愿望，同时也有利于维护东南亚和世界各国人民的和平与安全。因此越南民主共和国政府不仅一贯尊重和严正履行日内瓦协议条款，而且主动地向南越当局提出旨在缓和局势，为双方互相接触、了解，进而共同来解决越南的政治问题而创造条件的许多积极办法。
    特别是遵照日内瓦协议所规定的来解决政治问题，并为适应越南全体人民的迫切愿望，越南民主共和国政府从1955年到1958年间，曾经五次写信给南越当局建议召开协商会议，讨论进行自由普选来统一国家的问题，原则上是凡有关普选事宜，即由双方以协商、互让和谅解的精神共同求得完满解决，并不能谁吞并谁。
    当南越当局表示否认日内瓦协议、拒绝协商普选的态度的时候，越南民主共和国政府曾经不止一次地向日内瓦会议两位主席要求加以干涉；另一面仍然坚持立场，作出种种努力，并在1958年3月7日和12月22日寄给南越当局的公开信中主动地提出许多具体而切实可行的合乎情理的建议。
    相反地，南越当局在美国的唆使下，一直采取破坏日内瓦协议、企图长期分割越南的政策，他们并采用了一切毒辣手段来迫害和残杀人民，进而使南越变为美国的军事基地，并且准备新的战争。因此他们对越南民主共和国政府有关进行协商以利普选的建议一概置之不理。他们也拒绝了有关两个地区之间恢复正常关系的建议。
    从1955年底起，他们就切断了通过临时军事分界线自由来往的关系，想把临时军事分界线变成割裂越南的永恒的疆界。他们这种行动完全违反了日内瓦协议最后宣言：“军事分界线是临时性的界线，无论如何不能被解释为政治的或领土的边界”的规定。接着，他们还采取了一系列旨在使越南南方成为一个单独的国家，像进行片面选举，成立所谓
  “立宪国会”，颁布法西斯独裁式的“宪法”。
    五年来，在“军事援助”的幌子下，和在“保卫越南自由”的陈腔滥调的掩饰下，美帝国主义给南越当局建立了一支包括正规军、保安团、民卫队的三十五万五千名的常备武装力量。此外，美帝还曾经先后三百八十次非法的把各种武器、弹药和战争物资运入南越；到1959年6月为止，曾经派出五十一个代表团到南越，其中包括各兵种的将军、司令以及军事、外交高级官员。在南越，军
  事基地日益增多。在战时只有六个飞机场，而今天在和平时期却增加至二十一个，其中
  五个是合乎“国际标准”的。从1957年起，
  美国正加紧在南越建立一个战略公路系统。
  这个公路系统可通过老挝南方和东南亚军事集团会员国之一——泰国相衔接。
    今年4月间，美国和南越当局又签订了一项所谓“和平使用原子能合作协定”，这是美国为了企图把原子武器运入南越所玩弄
  的伎俩。
    另一方面，美国千方百计地想把南越拉进“东南亚军事侵略集团”。美帝国主义不顾
  日内瓦协议所规定的条款，明目张胆地把南越置于这个军事集团的“保护”之下。几年来，南越当局还以“观察员”身份去参加这个军事集团历次举行的军事会议和军事演习。最近，南越和菲律宾、老挝以及美国在虚假的
  “合作”、“和平”、“友谊”的幌子下签订了双边协定。上述种种已成为指控南越在实际上已和东南亚军事侵略集团相勾结的有力证据。
    五年以来，越南南方实际上已成为美国在印度支那和东南亚地区实现干涉政策和挑动战争的跳板。南越政权代表还在金边指使和协助叛乱分子企图推翻柬埔寨王国政府。他们还派出走狗到老挝进行间谍活动，并在越南民主共和国边境从事骚扰。由此可见，背叛日内瓦协议的南越当局和在老挝挑起内战的萨纳尼空政府一切活动，都是美帝国主义侵略计划的一个组成部分，其目的是要在印度支那区域制造紧张局势，进而准备给东南亚军事侵略集团便于明目张胆地进行干涉。
    越南民族，是一个在八、九年抗战中曾经英勇战斗，忍受一切牺牲去捍卫和平、独立、统一和民主的民族，当然不容许美帝国主义及其走狗们任意侵犯民族的独立，破坏祖国的统一和挑起新的战争。美帝国主义为要实现它的野心，曾公开地给南越当局指出一条路线：“越南南方需要一个依靠警察和宪兵力量的强有力政府”。此外南越当局对南越爱国者，不管任何阶层、党派和宗教都采用血腥镇压与报复的措施来作为他们的“国策”。尤其是对前抗战人员及其家属，南越当局采取了异常野蛮残酷的迫害和报复手段，极其严重地违反了日内瓦协议第十四条丙款。
    南越当局的迫害政策具体表现在数百次大大小小的包括军队、警察、保安团、民卫队等武装力量对爱国者的残杀、“扫荡”，他们把这叫做“控共战役”或“扫荡战役”。他们扫来荡去，有时好几个月在一个宽达几百公里的地区内进行。他们逮捕、殴辱人民，奸淫妇女，杀人放火，到处抢劫，这无异于法殖民军队在侵略战争期间所犯下的罪行。最典型的是今年头几个月在边和地区大规模的“扫荡”。他们除了调动成万名正规部队以外，还派出了几十架飞机进行轰炸，杀害无辜居民。至今，这种“扫荡”仍然在继续扩展中。
    只在五年内，他们已制造了七千多次由零星的迫害发展到集体屠杀的血腥事件。成千上万的前抗战人员和爱国者被囚禁在集中营里，像制造香田惨案一样，不少村庄遭到摧毁。
    去年12月1日，一千多人在富利集中营惨遭毒毙，这件惨案是吴庭艳政权实现法西斯屠杀政策的典型表现。这个野蛮的惨案激起了全体越南人民和世界爱好和平、主持公理的人们极大的愤怒。
    在“密歇根大学代表团”的名义下，美国派出许多顾问来协助南越当局建立起警察机构和大批集中营，并传授所谓“科学”的刑讯技术。在今天的南越，如果人们要找出一个像蒋介石曾经设立的“中美特种技术合作所”那样的集中营，并不是一件难事。在那里，不只有一个，而是有二十多个颇具规模和制度的暴虐并不亚于蒋介石匪帮所设立的集中营。
    今年5月，南越当局颁布了“1959年第十号法令”，规定设立“特别军事法庭”，这是一种前所未有的极其野蛮的法制，它粗暴地侵犯了做人的基本自由权利，违反了法律上最普通的准则。
    南越当局在过去时间里制造了上述的典型事件，这说明他们的独裁政策已开始进入一个新的发展阶段：这就是他们正走上极端孤立的道路，必须用大规模的军事行动，颁布法西斯法令，并对人们采用最卑鄙的暗杀手段。
    由于美帝国主义和南越当局施行破坏日内瓦协议和挑衅政策，因此，恢复和平虽已五年了，按照日内瓦协议规定的时间也已过了三年，可是以自由普选来达到全国统一的事迄今还不能实现。分裂状态已拖延了五年，这在每个爱祖国的越南人的心头上留下一道还未医好的创伤。两个地区数以万计的家庭还被分离着；夫妻、母子、骨肉亲友都得不到团聚。在南越，约近二十万人遭到死伤或正被囚禁在黑暗的牢狱里。人们的生命财产得不到保障。由于美帝国主义的垄断，导致南越经济日益遭受窒息，绝大多数南越人民的生活日益陷于贫困境地：失业、饥寒交迫、各种社会弊病愈见发展。
    五年来，南越人民认清了美帝国主义干涉南越的危害性，他们不断地高举起和平统一祖国的旗帜。在北越，越南人民已经和正在竭尽全力来巩固各方面的工作，他们集中力量从事于和平建设事业，为争取统一国家打好基础。北越人民面对着美帝国主义和南越当局采取破坏和践踏日内瓦协议的行为，越加团结起自己的队伍，万众一心，揭穿美帝国主义和南越当局的恶毒阴谋和野蛮的罪行，他们要求美吴集团必须立即停止血腥镇压和使用报复手段。
    正像北越人民一样，南越人民迫切渴望和平和统一祖国的愿望已生根在每个人的心田里，这是任何力量所不能拦阻的。尽管南越当局采用各种野蛮的镇压、迫害手段，但南越人民仍然英勇地站了起来，为反对强迫当兵，反对拉伕去修筑军事基地，为反对南越当局强迫迁居、拆除民房来修建战略公路等卖国殃民的行为，展开不调和的斗争，1958年“五一”国际劳动节，西贡—堤岸地区五十万群众举行示威游行，他们提出要求和平、统一，要求恢复两个地区的正常关系，要求改善生活和民主自由权利。同志们，朋友们，美帝国主义和南越当局的奴役、迫害和挑衅政策不但不能压制南越人民争取和平统一的愿望，相反地，它促使各阶层人民日益团结起来，成为一支保卫祖国和他们自身生活权利的波澜壮阔的力量。
    越南人民要求美国军事代表团撤出南越，南越当局必须放弃奴颜婢膝追随美帝国主义的政策，应立即停止加强军备和准备战争，结束对前抗战人员和爱国者采取迫害与报复政策，保障他们的各种自由民主权利。南越当局必须和越南民主共和国政府举行协商，以利讨论在全国进行自由普选的问题，从而实现越南的统一。为给上述事项创造有利条件，两个地区应当恢复正常关系。
    五年来，越南人民的正义斗争已赢得了世界和平民主力量和社会主义阵营的同情和支持，它对越南人民在争取实现和平统一祖国的斗争中是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    以苏联为首的各个社会主义国家的政府和人民团体，一贯热情地支持越南民主共和国政府为彻底履行日内瓦协议而斗争的立场。世界爱好和平与正义的人民，许多亚非国家的政府和人民，他们在不少场合是表示同情越南人民的正义事业，并强调必须继续履行日内瓦协议。亚非人民团结理事会书记处决定以7月20日——日内瓦协议签订五周年纪念日作为“越南日”，这件事具有非常重大的意义，并且充分地表明了亚非各国人民对越南人民在争取祖国统一和反对美国干涉者的斗争中所给予的同情和支持。
    中国人民和中国政府是越南人民最亲密的战友和忠实的同志，一贯关心和全力支持越南人民为争取独立和统一的斗争。同时中国是日内瓦会议的参加国，对会议的成功作出重要的贡献，并且不断地为日内瓦协议的彻底履行而进行斗争。这使越南人民在和平统一祖国的斗争中感到情绪振奋，和加强了斗争力量。借今天这个机会，我谨代表越南人民向参加今天大会的同志们致以诚恳的谢意，并通过你们向兄弟般的中国人民表示衷心的感谢。
    由于全世界人民热烈的同情和支持，使越南人民受到无比的感动，从而更加深信自己的斗争事业一定会取得胜利。越南人民认清了自己在和平统一祖国的事业中已增加了许多朋友，正义的曙光掩盖了正日趋于衰亡的反动势力的阴影。
    越南人民一定赢得最后的胜利，越南一定会统一。
