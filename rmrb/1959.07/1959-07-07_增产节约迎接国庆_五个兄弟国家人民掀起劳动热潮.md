To increase production and practice economy to greet National Day, people of five fraternal countries are launching a labor upsurge.
In the second half of this year, the socialist family will be filled with joy. From July to November, five fraternal countries in Eastern Europe will celebrate the 10th or 15th anniversary of their National Day: the 15th anniversary of Poland's National Day of Rebirth, the 15th anniversary of Romania's Liberation Day, the 15th anniversary of Bulgaria's Liberation Day, the 10th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, and the 15th anniversary of Albania's Liberation Day.

To solemnly commemorate these great happy days, the parties and governments of these five fraternal countries have issued decisions to commemorate the festivals, which have been warmly welcomed by the people of these countries. People are commemorating their festivals with greater labor enthusiasm.

Albania
(Dispatch from our newspaper in Tirana on the 6th) The socialist labor competition movement launched by the broad masses of workers in Albania at the beginning of this year has achieved great results. The semi-annual plans of many factories and construction sites have been completed ahead of schedule. In order to greet the 15th anniversary of Albania's liberation (November 29), workers everywhere are working selflessly with even greater enthusiasm.

The workers who are building the Shkopeeti Hydropower Station on the Mati River in northern Albania completed their half-year construction plan in early June. They are now excavating a tunnel to change the water flow rate of the river.

In addition, construction of the Bistrica Hydropower Station in southern Albania is also being stepped up.

The Shkopeeti Hydropower Station and the Bistrica Hydropower Station are scheduled to begin generating electricity in the early years of the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965). This will enable Albania to catch up with the developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita electricity production. In total, Albania now produces sixteen times more electricity than it did before the war in 1938.

Bulgaria
(Dispatch from our newspaper in Sofia on the 6th) The working people of Bulgaria are responding with vigorous enthusiasm to the call of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party to greet the upcoming 15th anniversary of Bulgaria's National Day (September 9) with greater production achievements. At present, the bugle of battle has been sounded in factories, mines, construction sites, and the vast countryside, marching towards new production victories.

The working people of the capital, Sofia, recently convened a representative meeting of people from all walks of life. At the meeting, new guarantees were put forward, determined to over fulfill the 1959 production plan by 3.5%, produce 295 million leva worth of products beyond the plan, reduce production costs by 29.5 million leva, and additionally increase profits for the country by more than 40 million leva. Sofia's builders guarantee to complete the annual plan ten days ahead of schedule and complete the construction of a series of major industrial enterprises one month ahead of schedule.

In order to welcome National Day, Sofia's agricultural laborers have set ambitious goals, determined to double this year's agricultural production.

Following the working people of Sofia, the broad masses of workers throughout the country have also made guarantees to welcome the 15th anniversary of National Day. The workers in the Gabrovo region are determined to produce more than 68 million leva worth of products beyond the plan, and the workers in the Varna region, in addition to producing 28 million leva worth of products for the country this year, will also save 23 million leva and increase profits by 14 million leva beyond the plan. Workers at the Dimitrov Shipyard in this state guaranteed to complete the first ten months of production plans before September 7, completing the entire year's production plan one month ahead of schedule. The working people of Burgas Province guarantee to produce products worth 36 million leva over the plan. This means that by the end of the year, this province will produce an additional 6 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, 35 train carriages, 680 tons of salt, and 150,000 meters of cable for the country.

In addition, in order to celebrate National Day, the Bulgarian people will also participate in large-scale voluntary labor, planting 70,000 hectares of forests, building more than 1,700 kilometers of roads, and constructing 500 kilometers of new roads between residential areas, as well as building dozens of schools and reading rooms this year through voluntary labor.

German Democratic Republic
(Dispatch from our newspaper in Berlin on the 6th) The working people of the German Democratic Republic have launched a nationwide socialist labor competition upsurge to greet the 10th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. This competition, aimed at completing 80% of this year's national economic plan before National Day (October 7), has achieved remarkable results.

The broad masses of the German Democratic Republic have enthusiastically responded to the call of the party and government and launched socialist competition. Now, good news of the early completion of the semi-annual production plan is constantly coming from all over the country. Workers at the "October 7" large lathe factory in Berlin recently proposed to complete 80% of the annual production plan and increase labor productivity by 10% ten days before National Day. This challenge was quickly responded to by workers in various factories in Berlin. In the past month, workers from 65 factories in Berlin have participated in the challenge.

Striving for scientific and technological progress is one of the main contents of the mass movement in the German Democratic Republic to welcome the 10th anniversary of National Day. By mid-June, 2.4 million workers across the country had invested in the socialist labor competition centered on scientific and technological progress. Leading the way in this competition were more than 150,000 workers from more than 12,500 production teams striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Team".

In various socialist enterprises, there are also many Party and non-Party engineers and technicians who have responded to the call and jointly organized "socialist labor collectives" with workers to solve key production technology problems and promote technological progress. At present, there are approximately 7,200 such "socialist labor collectives" nationwide, including more than 67,000 engineers and workers.

In the rural areas, a competition to strive for the title of "Beautiful Village" has been launched as a gift to the 10th anniversary of National Day. The main goals of this competition are to increase crop yields and increase commodity production, especially to supply agricultural and livestock products such as meat, milk, and eggs ahead of schedule and in excess of the plan during National Day. As of May 15, 2,062 villages (accounting for 73.5% of the country's villages) had participated in this competition.

In the intellectual community, writers, artists, and journalists are also actively participating in this movement, striving to create better works.

In addition, handicraft cooperatives and individual handicraftsmen, private industrialists and businessmen, and many residents have also invested in the National Day dedication movement.

Poland
(Dispatch from our newspaper in Warsaw on the 6th) As the 15th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Poland (July 22) draws closer, the enthusiasm for welcoming the festival is also growing. Now, everywhere in the country, you can see the enthusiastic and vigorous people from all walks of life contributing their strength to welcome this major festival.

Whether in factories, mines, construction sites, or enterprises—everywhere is plastered with huge slogans welcoming the "July Festival," and everywhere is filled with boiling labor enthusiasm. After over fulfilling the plan by 1.5 million tons of coal in the first half of this year, Polish miners have put forward new guarantees to welcome National Day. By the end of this year, they will increase Poland's coal production to 100 million tons, which means producing 3 million tons of coal more than the plan. Workers in the chemical industry system have decided to produce products worth hundreds of millions of zlotys more to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Poland's National Day.

Farmers are enthusiastically preparing to welcome the 15th anniversary of National Day. They guarantee to build bridges and roads over rivers or build sports fields for schools. Farmers in the Mazovian District of Warsaw Province have done a lot of work in improving soil and building water conservancy projects. The youth of Warsaw Province are rehearsing amateur entertainment programs in the countryside, so that there will be singing and dancing everywhere in the countryside during National Day.

Urban residents participate in voluntary labor on holidays to welcome National Day. Residents of Warsaw participate in physical labor on 260 construction sites to beautify the capital. In addition, they use their spare time to plant flowers and trees in squares.

People from all walks of life have invested in the upsurge of welcoming the 15th anniversary of National Day. The forms of welcoming the National Day movement are diverse. Writers are preparing to publish collections of essays and poems celebrating the 15th anniversary of Poland's National Day. The best films of Poland's 15 years are being screened everywhere in urban and rural areas, and exhibitions introducing Poland's achievements in the past 15 years are being held everywhere.

Romania
(Dispatch from our newspaper in Bucharest on the 6th) Factories and enterprises throughout Romania have recently made guarantees to greet the 15th anniversary of Romania's liberation (August 23) with greater production achievements.

To offer gifts to the festival, many factories have raised production targets. For example, the coking workers of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine, the largest iron and steel industrial enterprise in the country, decided to refine 50,000 tons more coke than the annual production plan, and the steel rolling workers decided to produce 1,000 tons more steel.

Thirty metallurgical and machine-building enterprises in the Stalin region recently jointly held a production meeting, deciding to further carry out the socialist labor competition movement under the slogan of "highest labor productivity, lowest cost, best output, and quality." The Ernst Thälmann Tractor Factory in this state is preparing to save 3 million lei and produce 35 more engines before the festival. The factory's youth production team has also proposed that youth production teams across the country strive to become advanced labor collectives, and many factory youth production teams have responded to this call.

The chemical industry sector is taking practical actions to accelerate the construction of many new chemical plants and workshops to welcome the festival. Oil drillers drilled 20,000 meters over the plan in the first five months of this year, and they are now working at an even faster drilling speed.

The construction workers in the capital have also decided to greatly speed up the construction. They will complete 4,000 housing units before the festival, an increase of 1,400 units over the original plan.
