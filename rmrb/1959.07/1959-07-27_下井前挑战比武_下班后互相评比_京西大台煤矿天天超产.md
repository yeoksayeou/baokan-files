The Jingxi Mining Bureau's Datai Coal Mine has seen a double leap in both tunneling and mining since entering the third quarter. New coal production records are constantly being set, and daily production plans are exceeded every day. By the 19th, the mine had already overproduced more than 2,300 tons of coal, an increase of 8.5% compared to the same period last month.

In order to fulfill and overfulfill the third-quarter production plan, the coal mine's Party Secretary, mine manager, and chief engineer have all gone deep into the groups to discuss production plans with the workers and help them formulate production measures. At the same time, all the mine's employees are enthusiastically carrying out a socialist emulation campaign for large-scale bumper production.

After the enthusiasm of the workers was mobilized, the mine's leadership tightly grasped the daily plan. At the beginning of this month, coal production rose rapidly, but problems such as insufficient transportation capacity and inadequate timber supply emerged. As soon as this problem appeared, the mine leadership immediately took action themselves, repairing a batch of small mine cars. The mine manager led cadres to transport timber down the mine, and the problem of insufficient transportation capacity was quickly resolved.

Because the workers had a clear understanding of the daily production plan and saw the leadership's active leadership and help in solving specific problems, their enthusiasm grew. Groups, shifts, and individuals often challenged each other before work and immediately evaluated each other based on the completion of the daily plan after work. The daily quota for coal lane tunneling for tunneling workers is about 0.4 meters, but now many workers reach tunneling speeds of 0.6, 0.8, and more than 1 meter per shift. After tunneling workers Wang Wenzhong and Guo Jicai of the 23rd tunneling group started competing with each other, they would constantly shout loudly to each other and ask about the tunneling speed and situation when they went down to the mine for tunneling, even though their respective tunneling faces were a considerable distance apart. Both of them can overfulfill the tunneling plan every day. The three shifts of this group, which launched a competition between shifts, always prepare the materials and tools needed by the incoming shift before getting off work so that they can start working as soon as they start their shift, and they can also overfulfill the production plan. Because the workers in each shift are united and help each other, this group has overfulfilled the tunneling plan by more than 100 meters this month. Mining Team 10, which has overfulfilled the coal mining plan every month since the beginning of this year, is forging ahead after entering the third quarter and has now completed 95% of the entire month's plan for July, over-mining more than 1,000 tons of coal.

In the midst of the vigorous socialist competition, this coal mine held a congress of employee representatives on the 16th and 17th. Based on the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the specific situation of the mine, all employee representatives conscientiously discussed the third-quarter production plan, analyzed the actual situation of the coal mine, especially the recent situation where the coal mine tightly grasped the daily plan and overfulfilled the production plan every day. The representatives confidently assured that in the second half of the year, under the conditions of safe production, they would achieve red every ten days and red every month, guaranteeing to produce 60,000 tons more coal for the country on the basis of completing the national plan, and obtaining a coal volume reaching four to six months.

### 下井前挑战比武　下班后互相评比  京西大台煤矿天天超产

    下井前挑战比武　下班后互相评比
    京西大台煤矿天天超产
    本报讯　京西矿务局大台煤矿，在进入第三季度后，全矿掘进、回采双跃进，产煤新纪录不断出现，天天都超额完成生产计划。到19日止，全矿已经超额生产了两千三百多吨煤，比上月同期产量增加了8.5％。
    为了完成和超额完成第三季度生产计划，煤矿的党委书记、矿长和总工程师等，都深入到小组，同工人一起讨论生产计划，帮助工人制订生产措施。同时，全矿职工都轰轰烈烈地开展了大面积丰产的社会主义竞赛。
    在工人群众的积极性发动起来以后，煤矿的领导上就紧紧抓住日计划。这个月一开始，煤炭产量急速上升，但随着出现了运输力量不足，坑木供应不上的问题。当这个问题刚一出现，煤矿领导上立即亲自动手，抢修了一批小矿车，矿长带领干部们往井下运木料，使运输力不足的问题迅速得到了解决。
    工人们由于对日生产计划心中有数，又看到领导上积极领导和帮助解决具体问题，因此干劲越来越大。组与组、班与班、人与人之间，在上班前经常互相挑战比武，下班后立刻根据完成日计划情况互相评比。掘进工人煤巷掘进日定额是零点四米左右，现在许多工人每班的掘进速度达到零点六，零点八和一米以上。二十三掘进小组掘进工人王文忠和郭继才互相展开竞赛后，每天下到矿井进行掘进的时候，虽然各自的掘进面有一个相当的距离，但是他们总要不断地大声呼唤着，互相询问掘进的速度和情况，他俩每天都能超额完成掘进计划。展开了班与班之间竞赛的这个小组的三班工人们，每天在下班之前，总是把接班工人需要的材料和工具准备好，好让他们一上班就能干活，也都能超额完成生产计划。由于各班工人团结一致，互相帮助，因此这个小组在本月内已超额一百多米完成了掘进计划。今年以来月月超额完成采煤计划的采煤十组，在进入第三季度后乘胜前进，现在已经完成了7月全月计划的95％，超额回采了一千多吨煤。
    在轰轰烈烈的社会主义竞赛中，这个煤矿在16、17两日召开了职工代表大会，全体职工代表根据党的社会主义建设总路线的精神和本矿的具体情况，认真地讨论了第三季度的生产计划，分析了煤矿的实际情况，特别是最近煤矿紧紧抓住日计划，天天超额完成生产计划的情况，代表们都信心百倍地保证下半年在安全生产的条件下，要作到旬旬红、月月红，一吨不少、一尺不欠地保证在完成国家计划的基础上多为国家生产六万吨煤，获得煤量达到四个月到六个月。
