    Chinese Pavilion at the Poznań Fair
    By our reporter Li Ke
    The Chinese exhibition hall at this year's Poznań International Fair has attracted widespread attention.

    The Chinese exhibition hall exhibited more than 3,300 exhibits this time. Unlike in previous years, it is presented to the audience with a completely new style and appearance. What attracts the audience's attention is no longer just traditional Chinese goods such as silk, porcelain, and ivory carvings, but new machines produced in 1958. New machines and products account for most of the exhibition area. As soon as you enter the vermilion gate of the Chinese-style exhibition hall, you are greeted by a row of lathes: grinders, drilling machines, gemstone centerless grinders, watch lathes, and ultrasonic drilling machines suitable for processing hard and brittle objects. These are the new products manufactured by our working class last year that are being exhibited in Poznań for the first time. The audience also saw tractors, new precision instruments and many other modern products with high technical standards in the Chinese Pavilion for the first time. These exhibits vividly demonstrate the progress of Chinese industry.

    The Chinese Pavilion is one of the most visited exhibition halls at the Poznań Fair. Visitors include Polish party and government leaders, distinguished guests from government delegations of socialist countries, people from Western industrial and commercial circles, engineering and technical experts, and a large number of ordinary visitors. They praised the achievements of the Chinese Great Leap Forward. Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz visited the Chinese Pavilion on the first day after the opening of the fair. After seeing it, he wrote in the guestbook, praising the Chinese industry that is developing at lightning speed, and exhibiting rich products to all walks of life in Poland year after year. Ochab, a member of the Political Bureau of the Polish United Workers' Party, wrote after visiting the Chinese Pavilion: "The Chinese exhibits are amazing, which proves the amazing development of the Chinese national economy at a high speed." The "Free Warrior" newspaper said in a newsletter entitled "The Chinese Pavilion - A Sensation at the Fair" that after seeing the Chinese Pavilion, people need to change their impression of China. China is no longer a country of silk and umbrellas, but a country that produces modern lathes and precision instruments. Miners from Katowice and sailors from the Baltic coast praised China's great technological progress in recent years and called the Chinese Pavilion one of the most interesting exhibition halls.

    The exhibits of Chinese medical equipment aroused great interest from relevant parties. Our country exhibited a cobalt-60 treatment unit for treating tumors, an ultrasonic dental drill, and a complete set of surgical instruments. After seeing it, a Polish doctor said: "The young Chinese medical industry has reached the advanced level in Europe." The "Poznań Daily" wrote: "China's cobalt-60 treatment unit is a sensational exhibit at the fair."

    In another part of the exhibition hall, new products of my country's light industry are exhibited. The gorgeous and colorful handicrafts and light industrial products with various patterns, varieties and styles attract people's attention. The fragrance-emitting floral cloth manufactured in Shanghai makes young girls and housewives fondle them admiringly. A woman wrote in the guestbook: "The fragrance-emitting cloth will be very successful among women." Hero fountain pens are praised here, and Chinese ink is also well received. There are also the most visitors in front of the Chinese toy cabinet. Little bears that can play drums and frogs that can jump aroused great interest among people. The audience praised these toys for being exquisite and ingeniously designed.

    The Chinese Pavilion is busy all day long. Engineers and experts come to ask for drawings and instructions, and when the audience leaves the exhibition hall, they write down their praise for the achievements of the Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people in the guestbook with satisfaction, expressing their best wishes to the Chinese people. These inscriptions express the common views and wishes of the Polish people. A visitor named Czakszewski wrote after reading all the inscriptions in the guestbook: "All the praises here are practical, and I am willing to sign under all the opinions." (Attached picture)

    波兹南博览会的中国馆
    本报记者　李克
    中国在今年波兹南国际博览会上的展览馆引起了普遍的注意。
    中国展览馆本次共展出了三千三百多种展品，和历年不同，它完全以崭新的风格和面貌呈现在观众之前。吸引观众注意的已不仅是中国的丝绸、瓷器、象牙雕刻等传统的商品，而是1958年出产的新机器。新式机器和产品占了大部分展览面积。一走进具有中国风味的展览馆的朱漆大门，迎面就是一排车床：磨床、钻床、宝石无心磨床、钟表车床，还有适于加工坚硬易碎物品的超声波钻床，这些都是第一次在波兹南展出的我国工人阶级去年制造的新产品。观众们也第一次在中国馆看到拖拉机、新式精密仪器等许多现代化的具有高度技术水平的产品。这些展品生动的显示了中国工业的进步。
    中国馆是波兹南博览会上观众最多的展览馆之一。来这里参观的有波兰党政领导人，各社会主义国家政府代表团的贵宾，也有西方工商业界人士，工程技术专家，以及大批的普通参观者。他们赞扬了中国大跃进的成就。波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹在博览会开幕后的第一天就到中国馆来参观了，他看后在留言簿上题词，称赞以闪电般的速度发展着的中国工业，一年比一年多地向波兰各界展出了丰富的产品。波兰统一工人党政治局委员奥哈布在参观中国馆后题词说：“中国的展品引人惊异，它证明了中国国民经济高速度的惊人发展”。“自由战士报”在一篇题为“中国馆——在博览会引起轰动”的通讯中说，看过中国馆之后，人们要改变对中国的印象，中国不再是丝绸和洋伞的国家，而是生产现代车床和精密仪器的国家。卡托维茨的矿工、波罗的海岸上来的水手都称赞中国最近几年的巨大技术进步，称中国馆是最有趣的展览馆之一。
    中国医疗器械的展品引起有关方面极大的兴趣。我国展出了治疗瘤症的钴60治疗台、超声波牙钻、全套手术用具，一位波兰医生看完后说：“年轻的中国医学工业达到了欧洲的先进水平”。“波兹南报”写道：
  “中国的钴60治疗台是博览会上哄动听闻的展品。”
    在展览馆的另一部分展出了我国轻工业的新产品，瑰丽多彩，花色、品种、式样繁多的手工艺品和轻工业品引人伫足，上海制造的发散香味的花布使年轻的姑娘和家庭主妇们爱不释手。一位妇女在留言簿上写道：“发香味的布会在妇女当中获得很大成功。”英雄金笔在这里受到赞美，中国的墨水也得到好评。在中国的玩具柜前也围着最多的观众。会打鼓的小熊，会跳的青蛙，都引起人们很大兴趣。观众们称赞说这些玩具精巧玲珑，设计别具匠心。
    中国馆里整天应接不暇，工程师和专家们来要图样和说明书，观众们在离开展览馆时以满意的心情在留言簿上题下对中国人民大跃进成就的赞扬，表达他们对中国人民最美好的愿望。这些题字表达了波兰人民的共同看法和愿望。一个名叫查克谢夫斯基的参观者在看了留言簿上所有的题词后写道：“这里所有的称赞都是切合实际的，我愿意在所有的意见下签名”。（附图片）
