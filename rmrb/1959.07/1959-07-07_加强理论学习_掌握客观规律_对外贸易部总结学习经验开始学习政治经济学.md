    Strengthen Theoretical Study and Master Objective Laws
    Ministry of Foreign Trade Summarizes Learning Experience and Begins Studying Political Economy

    (Our dispatch) To enable the broad masses of cadres to gain a more systematic theoretical understanding of the economic laws of our country's socialist construction, to further understand the great significance of the Party's general line for socialist construction and economic construction policies for accelerating socialist construction, and thereby ensure better completion of foreign trade tasks, more than 3,000 cadres in the Ministry of Foreign Trade began studying the socialist part of political economy on July 1st.

    The Party Committee of the organs of the Ministry of Foreign Trade attached great importance to this study. As early as mid-June, they formulated a study outline and study plan for the socialist part of political economy. In addition to repeatedly explaining the purpose, significance, and methods of study, the plan specifically requires Party organizations at all levels to strengthen specific and meticulous ideological and organizational leadership, and to constantly and patiently explain to the broad masses of cadres: acquiring knowledge and learning theory requires firm perseverance; only by conscientiously persisting, not fearing difficulties, and studying diligently can we conquer the fortress of knowledge. Leading cadres at all levels must also set an example and actively take the lead in participating in the study. As for the organizational leadership of the study, the plan stipulates that it shall be led jointly by the Party Committee and Party groups; in each unit, the role of the study central group shall be strengthened under the unified leadership of the Party organization. In the study groups, the director of the division shall be the natural study group leader. In this way, leading cadres at all levels can grasp both work and study, arrange work and study in a unified manner, closely integrate them, ensuring both study time and linking with reality to better solve practical problems.

    At present, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres for learning is very high. In many units, in addition to adhering to the six hours of study time per week stipulated by the Party Committee, they are also making every second count in their spare time, studying diligently on their own. Since the beginning of the study on July 1st, many people in eight units, including the China National Machinery Import Corporation and the China National Instruments Import Corporation, have been studying collectively in the evenings, and some have already achieved ten to twelve hours of study per week. Cadres from the General Administration of Customs who were on business trips and attending meetings in other places also insisted on one hour of study every day. Some comrades in this unit also insisted on reading five pages of theoretical books on political economy every day, no matter how busy they were with work. The vast majority of units, more than 95%, took study notes.

    The reason why the study of political economy in the Ministry of Foreign Trade can go so well from the beginning is mainly because the unit has a relatively solid foundation in theoretical study. Since the rectification campaign last year, the Party Committee of the organs of the Ministry of Foreign Trade has further strengthened the leadership of theoretical study. They combined it with the major political tasks of our country in each period and promptly led the organs' cadres to study. In the past year, they have successively studied the "General Line of the Party for Socialist Construction," the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes," the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party, and so on. Through study, the broad masses of cadres have developed good habits of reading carefully, studying diligently, thinking independently, and asking questions boldly. Some people have already regarded study as one of the elements of life. They said: "Not studying is as uncomfortable as not eating."

    The experience of the Ministry of Foreign Trade in the previous period of theoretical study is that theoretical study must be persistent and regular, and we must firmly grasp the fundamental method of theoretical study: linking theory with practice. At the beginning of the study of the Party's general line for socialist construction last year, the Party Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Trade pointed out that the purpose of theoretical study is to improve people's ability to understand and transform objective things. Therefore, it is necessary to closely integrate with objective reality in order to study well. All units paid attention to using the "arrow" of theory to shoot the "target" of practice. The Power, Mining and Metallurgy Division of the China National Machinery Import Corporation, based on the spirit that economic work must be done more and more meticulously, extensively carried out investigation and research work, trying to improve commodity packaging and choose reasonable transportation routes, and saved the state 114,000 yuan in transportation and miscellaneous fees in the first and second quarters of this year. Niu Chuanlian of the China National Transportation Machinery Import Corporation, through the study of the general line, criticized the individualistic idea that he was unwilling to teach knowledge and experience to others, changed his style, not only took on two apprentices, but also systematically summarized his work experience and contributed it to the Party. Not only did theoretical study promote the development of work, but the development of work in turn enriched the content of theoretical study. When studying the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Finance and Accounting Division of the China National Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation, in connection with Chairman Mao's relevant works, deeply studied what is the mainstream, what is the non-mainstream, what is the phenomenon, and what is the essence. Since the decentralization of power last year, some comrades in the division believed that since power had been decentralized, they had nothing to do, so they were not motivated enough, and many problems occurred in their work. Through study, after deeply analyzing the work of the division, they believed that the decentralization of power and the reduction of specific work were only phenomena, not the essence. The essential problem is that precisely because power has been decentralized, the leadership must be strengthened and the working methods must be improved. Therefore, they firmly grasped this essential problem and studied how to strengthen leadership and how to improve working methods, and the comrades' enthusiasm for study and work was very high. In this way, the content of theoretical study became richer, more specific, and profound. Therefore, some comrades said: In the past, I studied theory for exams, and I crammed books dryly. Now, studying is combined with transforming ideas and improving work. The more I study, the more I want to study, and the more I study, the more interesting it becomes!

    The experience of the Ministry of Foreign Trade in the previous period of linking theory with practice is that, first of all, it must be linked after carefully reading, studying diligently, and understanding the spirit and essence of the documents. Units that do this well have good results, preventing both the dogmatism of only reading and studying theory without combining it with practice, and the empiricism of only talking about practical problems without systematically studying theory. A few units did not pay attention to this problem. At the beginning of the study, they were eager to link it with practice without first understanding the documents, and as a result, they were trapped in a circle of a large number of practical problems. A few units simply studied nouns and theories, and as a result, the more they studied, the more "mysterious" it became. Secondly, linking with practice must have a focus, and cannot be linked with everything in general. Their focus on linking with practice is: the current national political life, the socialist construction policy, policies and some important issues in foreign trade work. For example, when studying the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes," many units of the department that mainly engaged in export business studied how to organize the purchase of agricultural and sideline products for export under the new situation of people's communes.

    Now, after study and summary, the Ministry of Foreign Trade has applied the experience gained in the previous period of study to the current study of political economy. (Miao Yiqin)

### 加强理论学习　掌握客观规律  对外贸易部总结学习经验开始学习政治经济学

    加强理论学习　掌握客观规律
    对外贸易部总结学习经验开始学习政治经济学
    本报讯　为使广大干部从理论上比较系统地认识我国社会主义建设的经济规律，进一步理解党的社会主义建设总路线和经济建设方针对加速社会主义建设的重大意义，从而保证更好地完成对外贸易任务。对外贸易部三千多名干部已在本月1日开始了政治经济学社会主义部分的学习。
    中共对外贸易部机关委员会对这次学习极为重视，早在6月中旬，他们就制定了政治经济学社会主义部分学习大纲和学习计划。计划除再三阐明学习目的、意义和学习方法以外，特别要求各单位党组织加强具体细致的思想领导和组织领导，经常地不厌其烦地向广大干部说明：求知识，学理论，没有坚强的毅力是不行的，只有认真坚持，不怕困难，刻苦钻研，才能攻克知识堡垒。各级领导干部还必须以身作则，积极带头参加学习。至于学习的组织领导，计划规定：由党委、党组共同领导；在各单位则在党组织的统一领导下，加强学习中心组的作用。在学习小组里，处长为当然学习组长。这样，可以使各级领导干部一手抓工作，一手抓学习，工作、学习统一安排，密切结合，既能保证学习时间，又能联系实际，更好地解决实际问题。
    目前，广大干部学习情绪十分高涨，许多单位的同志除按党委规定的每周坚持六小时学习时间外，业余时间也是分秒必争，刻苦自学。中国机械进口公司、中国仪器进口公司等八个单位，从1日开始学习以来，许多人利用晚上业余时间集体学习，有些人已经做到每周学习十到十二小时。海关总署到外地出差和开会的干部，每天也都坚持了一小时的学习。这个单位还有些同志不管工作怎样忙，每天总要坚持读五页有关政治经济学的理论书籍。极大部分单位95％以上的同志做了学习笔记。
    对外贸易部政治经济学的学习所以能在一开始就学得这样好，主要原因之一，是这个单位的理论学习比较有基础。从去年整风以后，中共对外贸易部机关委员会就进一步加强了理论学习的领导。他们结合各时期我国的重大政治任务，及时领导机关干部学习。一年来，他们先后学过“党的社会主义建设总路线”，中共中央“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，党的六中全会文件，等等。广大干部通过学习，已养成认真读书、刻苦钻研、独立思考、大胆发问的良好习惯。有些人已经把学习当成生活要素之一。他们说：“不学习，就像没有吃饭一样难受。”
    对外贸易部前一时期理论学习的经验是，理论学习要能坚持经常，一定要紧紧掌握理论学习的根本方法：理论联系实际。去年，党的社会主义建设总路线学习开始时，对外贸易部党委即指出，理论学习的目的是为了提高人们认识和改造客观事物的能力。因此，必须紧密结合客观实际才能学好。各个单位都注意用理论之“矢”，射实际之“的”。中国机械进口公司动力矿冶处，根据经济工作必需越做越细致的精神，广泛地开展了调查研究工作，设法改进商品包装和选择合理的运输路线，在今年一、二季度就节省国家运杂费十一万四千元。中国运输机械进口公司牛传链，通过总路线学习，批判了个人不肯把知识、经验教给别人的个人主义思想，转变了作风，不但带了两个徒弟，而且把自己的工作经验加以系统总结，贡献给党。不仅理论学习促进了工作的发展，工作的发展反过来又丰富了理论学习的内容。中国畜产公司财会处在学习党的社会主义建设总路线时联系毛主席的有关著作，深入研究了什么是主流，什么是非主流，什么是现象，什么是本质等等问题。该处自从去年权力下放以来，曾有部分同志认为既然权力下放，自己也就没有什么事情可做了，因此干劲不足，工作中曾发生不少问题。通过学习，深入分析了处里的工作以后，认为权力下放，具体工作少了只是现象，不是本质。本质问题是，正因为权力下放，领导更要加强，工作方法还要改进。于是，他们紧紧抓住这一本质问题，研究了如何加强领导，如何改进工作方法的问题，同志们学习和工作情绪都十分高涨。这样，就使理论学习的内容更加丰富、具体深刻。所以，有些同志说：过去我学理论是为了考试，干巴巴地啃书，现在学习和改造思想、改进工作结合起来了，真是越学越想学，越学越有味！
    对外贸易部前一时期理论联系实际的经验是，首先，必须在认真读书、刻苦钻研、弄通文件精神、实质的基础上，再去联系。凡是这样做的单位，效果就好，既防止了只读书、只钻研理论而不和实际相结合的教条主义，又防止了只谈实际问题而不系统钻研理论的经验主义。有个别单位没有注意这个问题，在刚开始学习时，没有先弄通文件，就急于去联系实际，结果陷在一大堆实际问题的圈子里；有个别单位单纯钻名词，钻理论，结果越学越“玄”。其次，联系实际必须有重点，不能泛泛地什么都联系。他们联系实际的重点是：当前国家的政治生活、社会主义建设的方针、政策和对外贸易工作中的一些重要问题。例如，在学习“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”时，这个部许多以经营出口业务为主的单位，就联系研究了在人民公社化的新形势下，如何组织农副产品出口物资的收购工作。
    现在，对外贸易部经过学习总结，已把前一时期学习中所获得的经验，运用到这次政治经济学的学习中去。　（缪宜琴）
