Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 5th. The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a statement to the press today, calling on all African people to boycott the fourth routine meeting of the "Executive Council of the French Community," scheduled to be held in Madagascar on the 7th. French President De Gaulle arrived in Madagascar on the 4th to preside over this meeting. The statement calls on all African people to greet De Gaulle with black flags everywhere, in order to unambiguously demonstrate the true feelings of Africans towards this harmful action by French imperialists.

Commenting on De Gaulle's so-called "French Community Plan," the statement said that this plan is a tactic of French imperialism to salvage its crumbling absolute dominance over the African continent and to disintegrate and undermine the increasingly high tide of the African people's struggle for freedom. This plan attempts to continue maintaining French rule in Africa in other ways.

The statement said that it is becoming increasingly clear that De Gaulle's so-called "French Community Plan" is an attempt to permanently maintain colonial rule in Africa. Therefore, this plan will never be accepted by the African people, who are determined to fight to the end for complete freedom.

    亚非团结理事会号召非洲人民
    用黑旗迎接戴高乐
    新华社开罗5日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天向报界发表一项声明，号召所有非洲人民抵制预定7日在马达加斯加举行的“法兰西共同体行政委员会”第四次例行会议。为了主持这个会议，法国总统戴高乐已经在4日到达马达加斯加。这个声明号召所有非洲人民在各个地方用黑旗来迎接戴高乐，以便毫不含糊地表明非洲人对法国帝国主义者的这个有害行动的真实感情。
    声明在评论戴高乐的所谓“法兰西共同体计划”时说，这个计划是法国帝国主义的一个策略，为的是挽救它对非洲大陆的摇摇欲坠的绝对统治权，瓦解和破坏非洲人民日益高涨的为争取自由而进行的斗争。这个计划企图用其他的方式来继续维持法国在非洲的统治。
    声明说，越来越清楚，戴高乐的所谓“法兰西共同体计划”是企图在非洲永久保持殖民统治。因此，这个计划永远也不会为非洲人民所接受，非洲人民决心为获得完全的自由而斗争到底。
