Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 2nd: Zhang Guohua, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee and Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, spoke on June 28th at the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region on the policy and steps for implementing democratic reform, which the Tibetan people urgently demand.

Zhang Guohua first reported on some major situations he had learned about recently in the Shannan area. From May 15th to June 3rd, he and Comrade Zhou Renshan, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, visited parts of Gongga, Jiedexiu, Naidong, Zhalang, and Longzi in the Shannan area, and interviewed Duichong, Langsheng, Chaba, handicraftsmen, and patriotic progressive upper-class figures.

He said: The full-scale armed rebellion launched by the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group in collusion with imperialists and foreign interventionists began in the Shannan area. Since June of last year, the rebellious elements held four meetings in Zhegu, Longzi, Lajiari, and Pozhang in Shannan, plotting so-called Tibetan "independence" and engaging in treasonous activities such as opposing reform, organizing, and forcing the masses to join the "Volunteer Army for the Defense of Religion" and the "Local Army." Unidentified planes of unknown nationality were repeatedly discovered airdropping weapons, ammunition, and supplies to them, proving that they were colluding with imperialists and foreign interventionists. The original Tibetan local government also sent people to Shannan twice under the pretext of "peace talks" to directly plan, organize, and direct the rebellion. Langselin and others were sent to Shannan to direct the rebellion. Rebellion leader Suokang openly declared Longzi Zong as their "second capital," indicating that their planning for the rebellion had been going on for a long time.

The broad masses of the people in Shannan suffered serious trampling and harm from the rebels during their occupation, including forced grain requisition, looting of property, rape, arson, and murder. When the rebellious elements lived in Shabao Village, Zhalang Zong, they raped all the women in the village, even old women in their sixties and young girls of fourteen or fifteen were not spared. These inhumane bestialities were precisely the evil deeds committed by those who claimed to "protect religion" and "protect the interests of the Tibetan people." In the Qude Gong area of Naidong Zong, the rebels demanded grain from a serf. When the serf did not produce the grain, they killed him and left his body at the bridgehead of the Xiangbo River, exposing it for seven days and forbidding anyone to collect it. The rebels also persecuted patriotic and progressive upper-class figures in various ways. Gagjong's manor was set on fire by the rebellious elements because he was patriotic and progressive.

He said: The above facts are just a few examples among thousands, but even these can fully illustrate the tragic experiences of the people in the Shannan area. In order to completely quell the rebellion and liberate the Tibetan people, the People's Liberation Army immediately launched a suppression campaign against the rebels in Shannan after the rebellion in Lhasa was put down. The struggle to quell the rebellion in Shannan began in April this year, and in a short period of less than two months, great victories have been achieved, the rebels' base has been destroyed, and the main force of the rebellious armed forces has been defeated. The vast majority of the masses who were coerced into participating in the rebellion automatically broke away from the rebels and registered to surrender to us as soon as our suppression campaign began. Now, with the vigorous support of the broad masses of monks and laypeople, the People's Liberation Army is actively carrying out the work of recruiting surrenders from the rebels in accordance with the Party and the state's lenient policy, and is carrying out annihilating blows against the few scattered rebels who are still stubbornly resisting and fleeing. The rebels have been basically wiped out, and the conspiracy of the rebellious elements has suffered a shameful defeat. This has opened up infinitely broad prospects for the complete liberation of the Tibetan people, the liberation of Tibetan social productive forces, and the development of various construction undertakings in Tibet.

When analyzing the class situation in the Shannan area, Zhang Guohua said: The Shannan area is a relatively rich agricultural area, known as the granary of Tibet. According to incomplete statistics, it has a population of about 180,000, 500,000 "ke" of land, and nearly 900,000 head of livestock, averaging about three "ke" of land and five head of livestock per person. The average annual output per "ke" of land is about eight "ke" (224 catties in total), and individual cases can reach more than 30 "ke." The total annual grain harvest can be more than 100 million catties, averaging more than 670 catties per person. Because Shannan has long been ruled by the feudal serf system, the situation of class differentiation is particularly obvious. Poor farmers account for about 70%, middle farmers account for 25% to 26%, and serf owners account for only 4% to 5%. Wealth is also highly concentrated, and the main means of production are owned by the three major estate-holders. For example, of the total land in the area, temples own 39.5%; nobles own 29.6%; and the original Tibetan local government system owns 30.9%. The three major estate-holders cruelly exploited the vast number of serfs by completely owning the land, with temples owning the most land and the amount of exploitation being relatively heavy. Their methods of exploitation are roughly as follows: 1. Estate-holder's own land, mainly cultivated by domestic slaves (Langsheng) and serfs' Ula corvée. 2. Corvée land, that is, the estate-holder divides a piece of land of poor quality to the serfs. The serfs who receive the corvée land must provide the estate-holder with a large amount of labor service or goods free of charge. 3. Leased land: one is directly leased by the estate-holder; the other is subleased by the big Chaba. Leased land is divided into fixed-rent and equal-rent (actually 30% to the tiller and 70% to the landlord or 20% to the tiller and 80% to the landlord), but no matter which type, all the seeds and labor required are borne by the lessee. 4. Land with both corvée and rent, this situation is more complicated. The planter must bear labor service to the estate-holder and pay rent to the estate-holder in kind or in currency.

The amount of exploitation by serf owners using land generally reaches more than 80%. In addition, serf owners not only collect hail fees in the name of religion, but also found shocking examples that are rare even in European medieval serf feudal society, such as taxes being levied on the dead, egg taxes being levied on roosters, and taxes being levied on the glazing of pottery. In this situation, serfs had to rely on predatory usury to survive. The conditions for serf owners to lend usury to serfs are very harsh. Some require a pledge of ornaments or other items worth more than twice the value of the loan before the loan is made. There are two types of loans in usury that are heartbreaking: one is debt passed down through generations, that is, debts accumulated from generation to generation; the other is joint and several liability debt, that is, one person borrows money and multiple people guarantee it. When the borrower flees or dies, the guarantors are responsible for repaying the debt. These debts are repaid year after year, generation after generation. In fact, the interest paid has exceeded several times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times the loan. Even the debtors do not know when the loan was made, who borrowed it, or how much was borrowed, but they must listen to the estate-holder and repay it year after year without end. This is truly "owing a thousand-year debt for one 'ke' of grain." Therefore, the masses often compare usury with Ula corvée and personal dependence as chains that bind them. In this society, serfs have no political rights or freedom. Serf owners can use them like livestock, and they can also be transferred (actually sold) to other estate-holders along with land and houses like livestock. Some serfs do not even have the right to live together as husband and wife. Serf owners can insult serfs at will. In Naidong Zong, Shannan, a Kanbu of a temple took a fancy to the daughter of a serf. He first used religion to deceive the girl into becoming a nun, and then raped her. When the girl became pregnant, the temple expelled the victim in the name of violating religious rules and fined her one hundred taels of Tibetan silver. What inequality! How dark! If such a backward, dark, cruel, and barbaric social system is not reformed, it is fundamentally impossible to develop Tibet's economy and culture and enable the Tibetan people to live a bright and happy life.

He pointed out: Under the cruel rule of the feudal serf system, the broad masses of monks and lay laborers deeply hate the serf owners. They said when they see the estate-holder, they "panic in their hearts when they hear the bell (horse bell) ring." They call the lamas who collect debts and force rent payments demons. They say that the dissolution of the original Tibetan local government is "throwing away a tattered and lice-ridden piece of clothing." Because the treasonous activities carried out by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group fundamentally violate the interests of the people of the motherland, especially the Tibetan people, coupled with the results of the work carried out by the Party in the Tibetan area for eight years, and the influence of the People's Liberation Army's exemplary implementation of the Party's ethnic policies, respect for the customs and habits of the Tibetan people, and assistance to the Tibetan people in various construction activities, the class consciousness of the masses has been enlightened. Therefore, the armed rebellion launched by the rebellious elements was quickly quelled. During the occupation of the rebels, the masses in Shannan continuously engaged in desperate struggles with the rebels. When the suppression campaign began, the masses actively supported the suppression campaign, actively reported the enemy's situation, automatically captured the rebels, and even engaged in face-to-face struggles with reactionary chieftains. After the military control committee announced the confiscation of land from the upper-class elements who participated in the rebellion and the implementation of the policy of "whoever sows, reaps" and no land rent this year, not only has the long-suppressed enthusiasm for production been significantly improved, but also the number of reports from the masses about the enemy's situation and the capture of rebels has been increasing day by day. Many of the rebellious ringleaders we captured in the Shannan area were reported or automatically captured and sent by the masses. The captured ringleaders include living Buddhas and Kanbu who fled with nuns, as well as the heads of rebel underground organizations lurking in nunneries. The masses are closely aligned with the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, and warmly support the People's Liberation Army's actions of not beating or scolding, not taking things, and protecting the interests of the people, and are very concerned about the People's Liberation Army soldiers. In the Jiacha area, one night in the pouring rain, the soldiers, in order not to disturb the masses, endured the biting cold wind and slept in the rain beside the village. As a result, an old woman found out and took the initiative to invite the soldiers to live in her house. But the soldiers politely declined. The old woman braved the cold wind and rain, and lit fires to keep the soldiers warm wherever they were on duty or sleeping. Another time, the People's Liberation Army used the grass of a family who was not at home because the livestock had no grass to eat. Because there was no one to pay the grass money to, they wrote a Tibetan letter and left the grass money. As a result, the people said, "The People's Liberation Army is really too good." At the same time, they also composed songs that spread everywhere in the area. There are countless moving examples like this. On our way to Zedang this time, wherever we went, men, women, old and young waved or applauded to welcome us, or shouted slogans.

In short, the broad masses of monks and lay people who have been oppressed and exploited for thousands of years have stood up today. As they themselves said, "The poor people have spoken," and "The sun of happiness is shining on our heads." They use these words to express their comfortable mood. The masses are currently urgently demanding the distribution of land, the abolition of the Ula corvée system, the abolition of serfdom, the abolition of usury, and the abolition of all the privileges of temples to oppress monks and lay people. All these demands are completely reasonable and just, and we should give them deep sympathy and fully support and help them realize these demands.

Based on the situation in Shannan and the demands of the masses, in addition to continuing to wipe out the remaining rebels who have escaped and implementing the policy of whoever sows, reaps on the land of the upper-class elements who participated in the rebellion, Shannan is currently mobilizing the masses to carry out the "three antis" (anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvée system, anti-serfdom) and "two reductions" (rent reduction, interest reduction) movements, establishing political power, and protecting production.

After briefly introducing the situation in the Shannan area, Zhang Guohua said that the policy and steps for carrying out democratic reform in the Tibet area have been discussed with Acting Director Panchen Erdeni, Vice-Directors Pabala and Apei, and members Lamin and Ji Jinmei in advance. Now, he submitted the results of the discussion to the meeting for discussion. He said that from the perspective of the entire Tibet region, March 10th was a turning point in the situation in Tibet. The original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group launched a rebellion, betrayed the motherland, and stood against the working people, which sharpened class contradictions and led to a situation of struggle between rebellion and anti-rebellion. Rebellion is a bad thing. But bad things can turn into good things. Due to the self-destruction of the rebellious elements, this has accelerated the time for implementing democratic reform and taking the socialist road. Now is the time to gradually implement democratic reform, and the reform is divided into two steps: the first step is to mobilize the masses, thoroughly put down the rebellion, and carry out the "three antis" and "two reductions" movements, and the second step is to distribute land.

At present, in agricultural areas, the agents of the three major estate-holders still control the masses, and the advantage of the masses has not yet been formed. The key to removing the feudal cover and establishing the advantage of the masses is to mobilize the masses, abolish the Ula corvée system and personal dependence, and implement rent reduction and interest reduction for the non-rebellious estate-holders.

At the same time, abolish the old rural political power and establish farmers' associations, which are the basic organizational forms for organizing and leading the masses to carry out democratic reform in rural areas. During the democratic reform, the farmers' associations are actually the basic-level political power organizations in rural areas.

In order to protect and develop livestock, in pastoral areas, livestock will not be distributed and a policy of mutual benefit for herdsmen and herdowners will be adopted (but the "three antis" must be carried out). Livestock of rebellious elements will be confiscated and owned by the original herders. The livestock of herdowners who did not participate in the rebellion will still be owned by the herdowners.

From the perspective of lamas, the vast majority are poor. The exploitation of them by temples is very cruel, and the hierarchy is very strict, so they are eager for liberation. Therefore, a movement against rebellion, anti-privilege, and anti-exploitation must be carried out in temples. But at the same time, we must unswervingly adhere to the Party and the state's policy of freedom of religious belief, protect patriotic and law-abiding lamas, and protect the cultural relics and historical sites of temples.

A policy of protection will be adopted for commerce, protection will also be given to law-abiding foreign businessmen, and support will be given to handicrafts.

In the distribution of land, the land, surplus houses, farming livestock, and agricultural implements of those who did not participate in the rebellion will be redeemed in the same way as the bourgeoisie are treated in the interior. (Attached picture)

    充分发动群众　实现民主改革
    张国华在西藏自治区筹委会第二次全体会议上讲话
    新华社拉萨2日电　中共西藏工委副书记、西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员张国华6月28日在自治区筹委会第二次全体委员会议上，就西藏人民迫切要求实行民主改革的政策和步骤等问题讲了话。
    张国华首先报告了他最近在山南地区所了解的一些主要情况，他从5月15日到6月3日，和中共西藏工委副书记周仁山等同志访问了山南地区的贡噶、杰得秀、乃东、扎朗以及隆子等部分地区，访问的对象包括堆穷、朗生、差巴、手工业者和爱国进步的上层人士。
    他说：原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义、外国干涉者所发动的全面武装叛乱，首先是在山南地区开始的。去年6月以来，叛国分子在山南先后于哲古、隆子、拉加里、颇章举行了四次会议，策划所谓西藏“独立”，并且进行反对改革、组织和强迫群众参加“卫教自愿军”和“地方军”等叛国活动。曾连续发现不明国籍的飞机向他们空投武器弹药和物资，这证明他们是与帝国主义和外国干涉者互相勾结的。原西藏地方政府也曾两次派人以“和谈”为名到山南直接策划、组织和指挥叛乱。朗色林等就是他们派往山南指挥叛乱活动的。叛乱首领索康曾公开宣布隆子宗是他们的“第二国都”；这说明他们策划叛乱是由来已久的。
    山南的广大群众，在叛匪盘据期间，遭到了叛匪逼粮要草、掠夺财物、奸淫烧杀等严重的蹂躏和残害。当叛国分子住在扎朗宗沙包村时，竟奸污了这个村的全部妇女、甚至连六十多岁的老太太和十四、五岁的幼女都无一幸免。这种灭绝人性的兽行，却正是那些声称“保护宗教”、“保护西藏人民利益”的衣冠禽兽所干下的罪恶勾当。在乃东宗的曲得共地区，叛匪向一个农奴逼粮，当这个农奴没有拿出粮食时就杀死了这个农奴，并将尸体放在香波河的桥头，曝尸七天，不准收尸。叛匪对爱国进步的上层人士，也是多方加以迫害，噶炯因为爱国进步，叛乱分子就纵火焚毁了他的庄园。
    他说：以上这些事实仅只是千百个事例当中的几个，但即使这些，也可充分说明山南地区的群众的悲惨遭遇了，为了彻底平息叛乱，解放西藏人民，人民解放军于拉萨叛乱平息后，立即进剿山南叛匪。平息山南叛乱的斗争从今年4月开始以后，在不到两个月的短短时间里，已经取得了伟大的胜利，摧毁了叛匪的根据地，打垮了叛乱武装的主力。绝大多数被裹胁参加叛乱的群众在我平叛一开始，就多自动脱离叛匪，向我登记自首。现在，人民解放军正在广大僧俗人民的大力支援下，一本党和国家的宽大政策，积极开展对叛匪的招降工作，对那些至今仍然执迷不悟、顽抗流窜的少数零散叛匪进行了歼灭性的打击。叛匪已经基本肃清，叛乱分子的阴谋已经遭到可耻的失败。这就为彻底解放西藏人民、解放西藏社会生产力、发展西藏各项建设事业，开辟了无限广阔的前途。
    张国华在分析山南地区的阶级情况时说：山南地区是一个相当富庶的农业区，素有西藏粮仓之称，据不完全统计，约有十八万人口，五十万克土地，近九十万头牲畜，平均每人约合三克土地五头牲畜。每克土地的平均年产量约为八克（共二百二十四斤），个别的可达三十克以上，全年共可收粮一亿多斤，每人平均合六百七十多斤。由于山南长期为封建农奴制度统治，阶级分化的情况特别明显。贫苦农户约占70％，中等农户占25％到26％，农奴主只占4％到5％。财富也高度集中，主要生产资料为三大领主所占有，如全区土地，寺庙占有39.5％；贵族占有29.6％；原西藏地方政府系统占30.9％；三大领主通过完全占有土地对广大农奴进行残酷剥削，其中以寺庙占有土地最多，剥削量也较重。其剥削方式，大体有以下几种：一、领主自营地，主要由家奴（朗生）和农奴的乌拉差役耕种。二、支差地，即领主分给农奴一分地质不好的土地，领得差地的农奴就要无偿地为领主支应大量的劳役或实物。三、租地：一是领主直接出租；一是由大差巴转租。租地又分为定额租和平分租（实际是倒三、七，或倒二、八）两种，但不管那种，所需种子和劳动都全部由租地者负担。四、又支差又交租的地，这种情况比较复杂，种地人既要负担对领主的劳役，又要以实物或货币向领主交租。
    农奴主利用土地的剥削量，一般都达到80％以上。另外农奴主除了利用宗教名义收取冰雹费等等之外，还发现有死了的人要上税，公鸡要上鸡蛋税，陶器上釉要上税等连欧洲中世纪农奴封建社会都所罕见的惊人事例。在这种情况下，农奴们为了活命就不得不依靠吃人的高利贷。农奴主向农奴出借高利贷时条件十分苛刻，有的在借贷之先就要押以价值高于贷款两倍以上的饰物或其他物品。在高利贷中有两种贷款是令人寒心的，一是子孙债，即世世代代积累下来的债务；一种是连保债，即一人借债多人担保，当借债人逃走或死亡时，担保人就要负责偿还这笔债务。这些债是年年还，辈辈还，实际上所还的利息，已经超过贷款的几倍、几十倍甚至几百倍，连偿债人都不知道是什么时候的贷款，什么人的借款，也不知道贷款多少，但是都要听凭领主所说无止境地一年年地还下去。这真是“为了一克粮，欠下千年债”。所以群众往往把高利贷和乌拉差役、人身依附一样比作是束缚在他们身上的锁链。在这种社会里，农奴们在政治上是没有任何权利和自由的。农奴主可以把他们和牲畜一样地使用，也可以和牲畜一样地随着土地、房屋转让（实际上是出卖）给另外的领主，有的农奴甚至连夫妻同居的权利都没有。农奴主对农奴的污辱更是为所欲为。在山南乃东宗，一个寺庙的堪布看上了一个农奴的女儿，他首先利用宗教欺骗这个女孩子当了尼姑，而后加以奸污，当这个女孩子受孕以后，寺庙竟以违犯教规为名，赶走了受害者，并罚她一百两藏银。这是何等的不平！多么的黑暗！这样落后、黑暗、残酷和野蛮的社会制度，如果不进行改革，要想发展西藏的经济、文化和使西藏人民过光明幸福的生活，是根本不可能的。
    他指出：在封建农奴制度残酷的统治下，广大僧俗劳动人民，对农奴主是深恶痛绝的，他们见到领主说是“听到铃铛响（马铃），心中就发慌”。他们把讨债逼租的喇嘛称为魔鬼。他们说解散原西藏地方政府是“丢掉了一件长满了虱子的破烂衣服”。由于西藏上层反动集团所进行的叛国活动是根本违反祖国人民，首先是西藏人民的利益的，加上八年来党在西藏地区所进行的工作的结果，以及人民解放军模范地执行党的民族政策，尊重西藏各族人民风俗习惯，帮助西藏人民进行各项建设等实际行动的影响，启发了群众的阶级觉悟，所以叛国分子发起的武装叛乱，迅速地被平息下去。山南的群众在叛匪盘据期间，就不断和叛匪进行殊死的斗争，当平叛开始后，群众更加积极地支援平叛，主动报告匪情，自动捉拿叛匪以至和反动头人进行面对面的斗争。当军管会宣布对叛乱的上层分子的土地予以没收，今年实行“谁种谁收”、不交地租的政策以后，不但长期被压抑的生产积极性有了显著的提高，同时群众自动报告匪情、捕捉叛匪的事情也日益增多。我们在山南地区所捕获的叛乱匪首中有许多是经群众报告或群众自动捕捉送来的。捕捉的匪首有携带尼姑逃跑的活佛、堪布，也有潜伏在尼姑庙中的叛匪潜伏组织的负责人。群众对中国共产党和人民解放军是亲密靠拢的，对人民解放军不打不骂、不拿东西、保护人民利益的行为，是热烈拥护的，对人民解放军战士是很关心的。在加查地区，有一次在大雨滂沱的夜里，战士们为了不惊扰群众，忍受着刺骨的寒风，露宿在村边的雨地里，结果被一个老太太发现了，主动要战士们到她的房子里去住。但战士们婉言谢绝了。这位老太太便冒着寒冷的风雨，不管在战士站岗的地方还是睡觉的地方，都为战士们生火取暖。另一次，解放军因为牲口没草吃，用了一家无人在家的人家的草，因草钱无人可交，就写了一封藏文信把草钱留下，结果老百姓说：“解放军真是太好了”。同时还编了歌谣在这一带到处传颂。像这样动人的事例是举不胜举的。我们这次前往泽当，沿途所到，不分男女老幼纷纷招手致意，或是鼓掌欢迎，或是呼喊口号。
    总之，千百年来被压迫剥削的广大僧俗人民今天站起来了。正如他们自己所说：“穷人讲话了”，“幸福的太阳照在我们头上了”。他们用这些话来表达自己的舒畅心情。群众当前迫切要求分配土地，废除乌拉差役、废除役奴、废除高利贷、废除寺庙压榨僧俗人民的一切特权。所有这些要求都是完全合理的，是正义的，我们应当寄以深切同情，并全力支持帮助他们实现这些要求。
    根据山南情况和群众要求，目前山南除继续肃清漏网的残余叛匪和对叛乱的上层分子的土地实行谁种谁收以外，正在发动群众进行“三反”（反对叛乱、反对乌拉差役制度、反对奴役）“双减”（减租、减息）运动，建立政权和保护生产等项工作。
    张国华在概括地介绍了山南地区的情况后说，关于在西藏地区进行民主改革的政策和步骤问题，事先已经和班禅额尔德尼代主任委员、帕巴拉、阿沛副主任委员、拉敏、计晋美等委员商量过，现将商量结果提请会议讨论。他说，从西藏全区来看，3月10日是西藏形势变化的一个转折点。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，发动叛乱、背叛祖国，与劳动人民对立起来，使阶级矛盾尖锐化，出现了叛乱与反叛乱的斗争形势。叛乱本是一件坏事。但坏事可以变好事。由于叛乱分子的自取灭亡，这就加速了实行民主改革和走社会主义道路的时间。现在是逐步实行民主改革，改革分为两个步骤：第一步是发动群众，彻底平定叛乱，进行“三反”“双减”运动，第二步是分配土地。
    目前，在农业区，三大领主的代理人仍控制着群众，群众的优势还未形成，要揭掉封建盖子，树立群众的优势，其关键是发动群众，废除乌拉差役制度和人身依附关系，对未叛乱的领主实行减租减息。
    同时，废除农村旧政权，建立农民协会，它是在农村组织和领导群众进行民主改革的基本组织形式。在民主改革期间，农民协会实际上也就是农村的基层政权组织。
    为了保护和发展牲畜，在牧区实行不分配牲畜和采取牧工牧主两利的政策（但要进行“三反”）。对于叛乱分子的牲畜，没收归原放牧者所有。未参加叛乱牧主的牲畜仍归牧主所有。
    从喇嘛方面来看，绝大多数都是贫苦的。寺庙对他们的剥削很残酷，等级也很严，所以他们迫切要求解放，因此，在寺庙中要进行反叛乱、反特权、反剥削的运动。但同时要坚定不移地坚持党和国家的宗教信仰自由政策，保护爱国守法的喇嘛和保护寺庙的文物古迹。
    对于商业采取保护的政策，对于守法的外商亦予保护，对于手工业加以扶持。
    在分配土地中，对未参加叛乱者的土地和多余的房屋、耕畜、农具，采取像内地对待资产阶级的办法进行赎买。（附图片）
