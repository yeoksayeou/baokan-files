    Garden Party Evening
    Qin Li
    Last Sunday evening, my whole family went to Zhongshan Park for the garden party. The boys excitedly ran to see the thrilling acrobatics performance, the girls happily watched the singing and dancing, and I enjoyed a good Beijing opera. Everyone got what they wanted and was very happy.
    Since the beginning of summer, the Beijing Art Enterprise Company, the Palace of Culture for the Working People, Zhongshan Park, and other units have been holding these garden party evenings on weekends, which have aroused great interest among the people and provided a beneficial cultural break for workers who have been working hard for a week. These garden party evenings are rich and diverse. Some feature wonderful performances by Beijing's professional art troupes and amateur cultural groups; some feature concentrated performances of colorful local operas by opera troupes from various places coming to Beijing; some screen a batch of excellent films; and there are also water music concerts, art exhibitions, fireworks displays, etc. Tourists can spend a pleasant holiday evening to their heart's content according to their own preferences.
    In my opinion, summer garden party evenings are a good practice. Not only Beijing, but also medium-sized and small cities or rural areas, can hold various large and small, different forms of garden parties or evening activities according to their own conditions. The content can be broader, such as organizing a ball game or chess competition. If it is in the countryside, on the threshing floor, invite people in the village who can play instruments and sing to play and sing, or tell a story, or organize the Young Pioneers to perform some programs, which will also be popular. In short, as long as those who engage in cultural and recreational activities use their brains and follow the mass line, they will be able to make everyone satisfied.

    游园晚会
    秦犁
    上星期日的晚上，我们一家大小都到中山公园去游园，男孩子兴冲冲的跑去看惊险的杂技表演，女孩子欢喜看唱歌跳舞，我自己听了一出好京戏，真是各得其所，皆大欢喜。
    入夏以来，北京市艺术企业公司和劳动人民文化宫、中山公园等单位在周末举办的这种游园晚会，引起了人们很大的兴趣，给了紧张工作一周的劳动者们有益的文化休息。这种游园晚会丰富多样，有的是北京的专业艺术团体和业余文工团体演出精彩节目，有的是各地来京的戏曲团体比较集中地演出多彩的地方戏，有的放映一批优秀的影片，还有水上音乐会、画展、放焰火等等，游客可以根据自己的爱好，尽情地度过一个愉快的假日夜晚。
    依我看，夏季游园晚会是一个好做法。不仅是北京，就是中、小城市或是农村，都可以根据自己的条件举办各种大大小小、不同形式的游园或是晚会活动，内容可以更广泛一些，例如组织一场球赛或是棋类比赛；要是农村，在打谷场上，请村里能拉会唱的人吹吹打打，或是说一段书、讲讲故事，组织少先队员们表演一些节目，也都会受人欢迎的。总之，只要搞文化娱乐活动的人开动脑筋，走群众路线，就会搞得人人满意的。
