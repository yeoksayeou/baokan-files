    Ahead lies a five-hundred-mile voyage.
    The night is as black as thick wine, making one feel a little dizzy to look at. Only a few lights, like rubies embedded in a black velvet blanket, timidly闪着 a small glow. How deep the night, how turbulent the waves!
    The fleet is advancing. The old captain leads the fleet in advancing.
    He stands on the bridge, frozen like a stone statue, his white hair covered with dew. But his eyes are闪烁, like a sharp sword, his gaze piercing the night sky. Reefs and rocks are all exposed before his eyes. He firmly issues commands: Straight rudder! Slight port rudder! Full starboard rudder! The Yangtze River, this fierce beast, is finally tamed under his majestic gaze; the fleet finally safely sails through the dangerous shoals in the dark night!
    Oh, I think of the eagles of the Three Gorges.
    You see, aren't the old captain's eyes as sharp and deep as an eagle's eyes? It can see through stone, see through the bottom of the water...
    "Haha, comrade, you're only half right. In the past, I did only see water and stone; now the Party has given me a new eye, allowing me to see farther and deeper, for example, the purpose of life, for example, the beautiful future."
    The old captain turns around and laughs heartily, his laughter rolling on the waves.

    老船长（外一章）
    余音
    前面是五百里航程。
    夜，黑得像浓郁的葡萄酒，望着令人有些眩晕。只有几点灯火，像嵌在一条黑绒毯上的红宝石，胆怯地闪着小小的亮光。夜，多么深，波浪多么汹涌呀！
    船队在前进。老船长领着船队在前进。
    他站在驾驶台上，冻得像一尊石雕像，白发苍苍的头沾满了露水。可是他的眼睛在闪烁，像一把锋利的剑，他的视线刺破了夜空。礁和岩石都坦露在他的眼前。他坚定地下着命令：直舵！左微舵！右满舵！长江，这只凶猛的野兽，终于在他威严的逼视下驯服了；船队终于在黑夜里安全驶过了险滩！
    哦，我想起三峡的鹰来了。
    你看，老船长的眼睛，不正像鹰的眼睛一样犀利深邃么？它能看穿石头，看穿水底……
    “哈哈，同志，你只说对了一半。从前呀，我确是只看到水，看到石头；如今党给了我一只新的眼睛，使我看的远了，看的深了，譬如生活的目的，譬如美好的未来。”
    老船长回过头来爽朗地笑着，笑声滚落在波涛上。
