Sowing Seeds of Science

The broad mass of grassroots cadres in rural areas share an urgent desire: How can they summarize and elevate the rich experience gained in agricultural production practice? How can they carry out scientific research activities to solve the technical problems encountered in production practice? This requires agricultural scientific research institutions and agricultural scientific research workers to provide specific assistance. Now, the Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has created a good method. Under the guidance of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, and closely integrated with reality, they have opened agricultural schools to train agricultural science research backbone forces for the people's communes.

Since last year, agricultural scientific research institutions and agricultural scientific research workers have carried out many activities in rural areas that are both beneficial to production and conducive to scientific research. They have also provided much assistance to grassroots cadres in rural areas, enabling them to improve their scientific knowledge and sow seeds of science in the countryside.

If agricultural scientific research institutions and agricultural scientific research workers in various localities can create more and better methods based on local conditions to help grassroots cadres in rural areas improve their scientific knowledge, then they will be able to sow more and better seeds of science, cultivate flowers of science for socialist agriculture, and reap even greater harvests.

    撒下科学种子
    广大农村基层干部有一种迫切的心情：如何把农业生产实践中所创造的丰产经验总结提高？如何开展科学研究活动，解决生产实践中所遇到的一些技术问题？这就需要农业科学研究机构、农业科学研究工作者给以具体帮助。现在，中国农业科学院江苏分院创造了好办法。他们根据江苏省委指示，紧密结合实际，开设了农业学校，为人民公社培训农业科学研究的骨干力量。
    去年以来，农业科学研究机关、农业科学研究工作者，在农村进行了许多既有利于生产、又有利于科学研究的活动。他们还对农村基层干部作了许多帮助，使农村基层干部在科学知识上得到了提高，在农村中撒下了科学的种子。
    如果各地农业科学研究机构、农业科学研究工作者，都能够因地制宜地创造更多更好的办法，帮助农村基层干部在科学知识上提高，那就能够撒下更多更好的科学种子，为社会主义的农业开出科学之花，获得更大的丰收。
