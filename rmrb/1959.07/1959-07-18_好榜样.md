　　Good Example
　　Building factories and bridges requires good engineers; cultivating the flowers of the motherland requires excellent teachers. We see many valuable qualities of an excellent teacher in Wu Zhijun. In a remote rural area, working as a teacher in a private primary school, one cannot teach students well without a stance, ideology, and work style like Wu Zhijun’s.
　　In our country, there are millions of outstanding teachers like Wu Zhijun. They love the countryside, love the peasant children, and love rural primary school education. Although their cultural level and professional ability may not be that high, they rely closely on the Party and the masses, study diligently, and work honestly, and can shine brightly in their jobs.

    好榜样
    修建工厂、建造桥梁，需要有好的工程师；培养祖国的花朵，则需要有优秀的教师。我们从吴志君身上看到了一个优秀教师的许多宝贵品质。在偏僻的农村里，当一个民办小学的教师，如果没有吴志君这样的立场、思想和作风，是教不好学生的。
    在我们国家里，有着千万个像吴志君这样的优秀教师。他们热爱农村，热爱农民子弟，热爱农村小学教育。虽然，他们的文化水平和业务能力并不那样高，但是他们紧紧地依靠党和群众，勤勤恳恳地学习，老老实实地工作，就可能在他们的工作岗位上放出光辉来。
