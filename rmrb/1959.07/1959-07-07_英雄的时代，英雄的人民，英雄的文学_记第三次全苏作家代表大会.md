    The Era of Heroes, the People of Heroes, the Literature of Heroes
    – A Record of the Third All-Union Congress of Writers
    Chen Bingyi

    The Third All-Union Congress of Writers, held in Moscow a little over a month ago, was a congress with a clear banner and inspiring spirit. Its central task was to unite and mobilize all forces of Soviet literature to serve the cause of communist construction. The congress demonstrated the strong vitality and vigorous prosperity of Soviet literature. It was a congress of great international significance. It was followed with concern and welcomed by progressive people all over the world, and it also attracted the attention and hatred of the enemies of the Soviet Union and the progressive cause of mankind.

    During and after the congress, the international reactionaries once again started up their propaganda machines of newspapers, periodicals, and news agencies, constantly spewing out that set of rotten and stale clichés to attack the congress and Soviet literature, saying that the congress was held in an "atmosphere of gloom" (French "Le Figaro Littéraire"), that Soviet literature had no "freedom" of creation (French "Le Monde", "France Observateur", etc.), that Soviet writers could only write "according to the orders of the Communist Party" (American "New York Times"), etc.

    Comrade Mao Dun, the head of our delegation, quoted a Chinese proverb in his congratulatory speech to the congress to describe the attacks on Soviet literature by international reactionaries and revisionists in recent years. This proverb was repeatedly quoted during the congress, both verbally and in Soviet newspapers. He said:

    "And what is the result of the enemy's malicious attacks? Just as a Chinese proverb says: 'An ant trying to shake a big tree is ridiculous and overestimates itself.' The enemy's attempt has completely failed, and Soviet literature still stands like a peak."

    It is very clear that the enemy's attempt this time, like any previous one, will still completely fail. Their slander and attacks will not only not detract from the success of the congress and the strength of Soviet literature, but will also prove, from the opposite perspective, the victory achieved by the congress and how heavy a blow this victory was to the enemy.

    What was most exciting at the Third All-Union Congress of Writers was the highly concentrated manifestation of the close relationship between the Party and the writers. The Soviet Communist Party gave such a high evaluation and such cordial care to the creative labor of Soviet writers, bestowed upon them such a lofty position in the great cause of communism, regarded them as reliable assistants to the Party in carrying out communist education for the working people, and called them long-range artillery to clear the way forward. And the Soviet writers also showed such unwavering loyalty to the Party, closely united around the Party together with the people, and so wholeheartedly determined to repay the Party's lofty trust with practical actions, "with labor, inspiration, skill, and career" ("Congratulatory Message from the Congress to the CPSU Central Committee"), and to dedicate all their strength to the great cause of the Party and the people!

    As everyone knows, what the enemies hate the most about Soviet literature – and also about the literature of other socialist countries – and what they have tried every possible means to undermine for many years, and what they have used modern revisionists to attack in recent years (although they have failed every time), is precisely this loyalty of Soviet writers to the Party and this close relationship between them and the Party. The enemies are always clamoring incessantly that in this way, writers have no "freedom" of creation, and therefore "cannot write good works," and literary development will "stagnate." But how "free" are writers in their countries, what "good" works have they written, and how "prosperous" is their literature – all this we have already learned. At this Soviet Writers' Congress, many writers, including those from Western countries, made thorough exposures.

    The American writer, Paul Novsky, gave a profound description. He said: "The contradiction between the ruling class' pursuit of war and enslavement and the people's desire for peace and democracy has distorted the entire life of America. Therefore, the spirit of our youth is declining, people live in a daze, and people suffer from nervous breakdowns in large numbers… Many writers are also extremely distressed, but they are not clear about what is happening. This emotion can also be seen in their works. Pessimism, despair, loss of faith in people, ridicule of progress, satire of socialist ideas, morbid and distressed pornography, decadence, etc. – this is the miserable scene of a young America that is rapidly becoming old and panicked.” In such a decadent atmosphere and degenerate state of mind, bourgeois literature will inevitably further deepen its process of differentiation and decline. As for the so-called American "culture" that floods the Western imperialist world and other countries within their sphere of influence, such as comics, books, magazines, films, and television that promote war, encourage murder, arson, and indecency, frantic A-go-go dances and hula hoop dances, and even the antics of apes "painting" and kittens "singing," etc., these can no longer be considered "art," but merely drugs sold by a group of "culture" manufacturers, raised by the reactionary ruling class, to anesthetize, corrupt, and harm people's minds.

    However, in the Western capitalist world, progressive and righteous writers who inherit their countries' excellent cultural traditions and represent their people's will are increasing day by day. There are many bourgeois writers who have groped for the truth in the cruel reality and embarked on the path of progress, and even communism. There are also many writers with considerable democratic sentiments and a sense of justice who are suffering and wandering on the wrong path. These writers cannot enjoy the right to free creation, or even free action, in their own countries. They are often subjected to various kinds of political and economic persecution. In order to reflect even a little bit of the people's demands for peace, democracy, and independence in their works, they have to risk starvation, imprisonment, and even beheading. Honduran writer Amaya-Amador said at the congress, "The capitalist class uses the methods of the medieval Inquisition to deal with progressive literature. This happened in Guatemala when it suffered violent American intervention.” In Honduras, Amaya-Amador said, realistic works that touch on social issues are often resisted, preventing them from circulating among the masses. His own *Green Hell*, which reflects the life of agricultural workers on the banana plantations of the American “United Fruit Company,” and *The Builders*, which deals with the lives of construction workers, have been destroyed by imperialists.

    In sharp contrast to the extreme corruption and decline of Western bourgeois reactionary literature is the flourishing of truly free Soviet literature. In the four years between the two congresses, according to Surkov's report, the number of Soviet works published in the Soviet Union increased by more than half, and the number of copies printed increased by almost three-quarters. Moreover, the congress pointed out that during these four years, many masterpieces with high ideological and artistic levels have appeared, and the rapid growth of the literature of all Soviet nationalities and the large number of new writers are particularly noteworthy. The dissemination and influence of Soviet literature abroad is also growing. According to the Soviet critic Zelinsky, in the past four years, 922 Soviet writers have had more than 2,000 works published abroad in 48 foreign languages. If the same works published in different languages in various countries are also counted, the total number reaches 5,300. That is to say, an average of two or three Soviet works are published abroad every day. This is only the numerical expression of the great achievements of Soviet literature. More importantly, the influence of Soviet literature on readers at home and abroad with its rich ideological content and beautiful artistic forms in terms of life and aesthetics is difficult to estimate concretely and fully.

    Soviet literature has made great achievements and contributions, but Soviet writers have not been complacent because of this. They deeply realize that, in the words of Fedin at the Moscow Writers' Congress on June 15, the task assigned to them by the Party is significant and glorious, but it is not so easy to complete. The Central Committee of the Party pointed out clearly in its congratulatory message: "The glorious task facing Soviet writers is to actively promote the formation of the spiritual outlook of the people of the future, the builders of a new life. The mission of Soviet writers is to educate them with communist ideas, cultivate their noble moral qualities and adopt an attitude of intolerance towards bourgeois ideas and morals," "The lofty mission of Soviet writers is to truthfully and vividly express the magnificence of the people's labor achievements and the grandeur and greatness of the struggle for communism, to be enthusiastic propagandists of the Seven-Year Plan, to inspire the vigor and drive in the hearts of the Soviet people, to eradicate the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness, and to help eliminate all obstacles that are still hindering our progress." How to accomplish such a significant and glorious task, how to further delve into life, keep pace with the great era, improve artistic skills, and create more and better works commensurate with the times, was the focus of the heated discussions at this congress.

    The delegates to the congress unanimously agreed that now the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have entered the first year of the great communist construction Seven-Year Plan, and they have demonstrated unprecedented heroism in their magnificent peaceful labor. This is a great and heroic era. Writers must appreciate this heroic and magnificent atmosphere of the era, and fully express the heroic spirit of the era and the magnificent spirit of its revolutionary cause in their works. To describe such an unprecedented new era and new world, new people and new relationships, to serve as the propagandists of the most sublime and advanced ideas of the era, and to act as the singers of all the most beautiful things in the world, is the greatest happiness of Soviet writers. The congress put forward the task of reflecting the modern era very highly, believing that it is the soul of Soviet literature, and it has now become an extremely important political, artistic, and aesthetic requirement. The congress powerfully criticized the erroneous views of the "distance" theory and the "eternal" theme (Note) that appeared in the previous period, believing that reflecting the modern era will not only not limit the activities of artists, but will instead broaden their horizons, deepen their understanding of real life, strengthen their connection with the life of the people, and promote writers to fully develop their talents in the selection of themes, genres, and artistic techniques. Correctly understanding and realizing the requirements of reflecting modern life will promote Soviet literature to new ideological and artistic heights. However, the congress also pointed out that modern themes cannot be mechanically divided in time, because many major phenomena in modern life are closely related to the past history.

    In order to truthfully reflect the heroic era, it is necessary to create images of heroic figures. The delegates believed that creating images of noble heroic figures of our time and letting them become models to guide people forward is the most important task of Soviet literature. The Soviet People's Artist Okhlopkov quoted Gorky's words more than 20 years ago in his speech: Soviet heroic figures like these are unprecedented in history. They are so simple, so bright, and so great. Their spirit of perseverance and rebellion is many times higher than all the Don Quixotes and Fausts of the past. Soviet writers should express them and help them realize that they are such heroic figures. Azerbaijani writer Ibragimov also said that Soviet modern heroic figures are so versatile and their spiritual world is so rich. In terms of the sublimity of thought and the richness of emotion, compared with Hamlet, King Lear, Farhad, etc., they are not only not inferior, but also greatly surpass them. It is the supreme glory of writers to create images of such people!

    Maintaining close contact with the life of the people is the soil for deeply reflecting modern life. This was pointed out by Comrade Khrushchev in his famous essay "Literature and Art Must Maintain Close Contact with the Life of the People" published two years ago. This congress emphasized this issue again. Bashkir writer Bikchintayev said, "Learning from life is like sailing against the current; if you don't touch life, you will fall behind." Many speakers believed that writers should respond to the Party's call and go deep into the forefront of the people's creative activities, because today's heroic figures and heroic deeds are produced there, the characteristics of new people are first formed and developed there, and the face of the future can be felt most concretely there. Some writers also pointed out that being with the life of the people should become a writer's own urgent desire, and should not be regarded as an obligation; at the same time, for some writers, the issue is not just where to live, but how to live.

    Many excellent Soviet writers maintain close contact with the life of the people, and many of their masterpieces truthfully reflect the heroic era and the heroic people. However, some works have also appeared in Soviet literature that are gray and mediocre, primitive and vulgar, written with low quality, and even have a rough and shoddy style. This is not commensurate with the heroic era and the heroic people. The congress made a general analysis and criticism of the shortcomings of such works. Many writers focused on criticizing some works that lacked the spirit of the heroic era and belittled heroic figures. Some writers often avoid using bright and eulogizing colors, fearing being accused of "embellishing" reality or pseudo-romantic spirit. But it must be known that eulogizing the heroic reality is by no means out of pure subjective desire, but is determined by the objective heroic reality itself. In addition, some writers have not yet been able to overcome the tendency to detach themselves from the era and from conflict and passion, and they have made idyllic descriptions of reality. They do not know that excellent Soviet works not only describe heroic achievements, but also show the emergence of heroic achievements and the path to achieving heroic achievements. Creation is struggle, any creation has conflict, but the current struggle and conflict have new significance. Huge conflicts, sharp contradictions, struggles with powerful enemies, and overcoming great difficulties are precisely the best soil for creating images of heroic figures, because heroic figures are produced from these arduous struggles.

    Reflecting modern life and improving artistic skills are two sides of a closely related and inseparable issue. The Congratulatory Message of the CPSU Central Committee stated very clearly: "Communist literature should become a great literature that is not only rich in ideological content but also superb in artistic skills. Great ideas require superb skills, and heroic figures require corresponding artistic embodiment. The people need a kind of literature that can cultivate and educate people with truthful and beautiful artistic forms, that can enrich them spiritually, broaden their horizons, and express the improvement of people's consciousness in the process of communist construction. Our society especially needs a literature that embodies modern and urgent themes with vivid artistic techniques." Therefore, the congress required writers to strictly treat their own creations, study artistic skills, and improve the quality of their works. Comrade Khrushchev quoted the writer Sobolev as saying: The Party and the people have given everything to Soviet writers, that is, they have deprived them of the right to write bad works, especially the right to write untruthful works. The congress called on Soviet writers to respond to the Party's call and strive to make Soviet literature the world's best not only in content but also in artistic skills.

    When discussing the issue of artistic skills, the congress vigorously promoted Soviet writers to freely develop the characteristics of their individual creative talents, boldly explore creative innovations, and realize the diversification of artistic expression techniques and styles under the general principle of socialist realism. The congress believed that the great achievements of Soviet literature and art prove that the method of socialist realism is the long-tested and most effective guiding creative principle and fighting weapon of Soviet literature. It is a summary of all the creative practice of Soviet literature, and it is the fighting banner raised by Soviet writers to march towards new ideological and artistic heights. It not only does not limit, but instead opens up a vast world for artists, enabling them to fully carry out free creation and give full play to their initiative in content and form.

    Many writers at the congress conducted extensive and in-depth discussions on the issue of creative innovation. The delegates believed that creative exploration is being carried out so stubbornly in all fields of Soviet life, and bold and intelligent exploration should also be carried out in the field of literature. When studying and thinking about modern life, Soviet writers must also explore new forms of expression. The ideas of the work must be refined through the furnace of artistic skills before they can be concretized and infect people. And the most advanced and humane new ideas, the new reality full of heroism, must be embodied with the latest and most advanced artistic techniques that are commensurate with it. Soviet literature is completely new not only in content but also in art. Its innovation is genuine artistic innovation, which is essentially different from the various modernist formalist innovations popular in the West. The latter is divorced from the people and life, and lacks social significance. The former is based on the people and truthfulness, and its roots are deeply grown in life and society. At the same time, new content cannot be applied to any new form. The new form must not only be adapted to the content, but also be consistent with the characteristics of the nation, the writer's own temperament, and the creative personality. Every nation and every writer in the Soviet Union should make contributions to creating their own unique style. As for the excellent traditions of Russian, Soviet, and world classical literature, of course, they must be inherited and carried forward, which will help the exploration of innovation. And constantly exploring new content and new artistic expression techniques is one of the most excellent, most advanced, and most revolutionary traditions.

    The diversification of artistic expression techniques and styles is a concern of many speakers. When discussing this issue, more than a dozen delegates expressed their views on the issue of the revolutionary romantic spirit. Some said that now is the revolutionary heroic era. In order to express the excellent qualities of the Soviet people, we need a literature with profound ideas and bright colors. Some said that in order to educate the younger generation with the revolutionary traditions of the past and the heroic spirit of today, literary works must be full of the spirit of revolutionary romanticism. Some said that some writers now take a crawling attitude towards the heroic reality, so they have lost the noble enthusiasm and the heroic spirit and romantic spirit that are indispensable for true art in their works, and are dominated by a kind of empiricism and flat realism. Without romantic spirit and without lofty ideals, socialist realism seems poor. The romantic spirit is not the writer's fantasy, but their understanding of the world and their expression of creative personality, so it can express the true spirit of the people and national character. In Soviet literature, the romantic spirit has various forms of expression. In the works of some writers, this style is expressed more strongly. In Russian, Soviet, and world classical literature, there are excellent romantic traditions. Soviet literature must inherit them and carry them forward. Some speakers also said that the style of the romantic spirit is based on reality, and should not be overemphasized, and even more cannot weaken the attention and trust in realism because of this. Realism has been determined as the main line of artistic development of Soviet literature.

    For Soviet writers, "this congress," as Tikhonov said in his closing speech, "is just a beginning. When the excitement that arose from attending the congress calms down, we will rise up with another kind of excitement: that is, the creative, inspired, and captivating kind of excitement - the writer's labor." Looking at the active scene in Soviet literary circles in the month since the closing of the congress, it can be affirmed that this new "excitement" has obviously arisen. We believe that in the near future, the seeds sown by the Third All-Union Congress of Writers in the Soviet literary garden will surely bloom with brilliant flowers!

    [Note]: The "distance" theory, the full name of which is the "distance inspiration" theory, means that only by maintaining a certain "distance" in time from things can the inspiration for creation be generated. The "distance" theorists believe that things that flash before you in modern life cannot be written immediately. If you want to write, you can't write well. Only after waiting for several years after things have passed, and the writer has a deep understanding of them, can good works be written. This specious "theory" actually defends the tendency of some to detach themselves from life and evade current major issues in creation. This erroneous "theory" had already been criticized at the Congress of Writers of the Russian Republic last December. The "eternal" theme theory believes that taking sharp so-called "temporary" modern themes cannot create "eternal" images and write "immortal" works. The conclusion drawn from this erroneous "theory" is the same as the "distance" theory, that is, modern themes cannot be written.

    英雄的时代，英雄的人民，英雄的文学
    ——记第三次全苏作家代表大会
    陈冰夷
    一个多月前在莫斯科举行的第三次全苏作家代表大会是一次旗帜鲜明和振奋人心的大会。它的中心任务是团结和动员苏联文学的一切力量为共产主义建设服务。大会显示了苏联文学的强大的生命力和蓬蓬勃勃的兴盛气象。这是一次富有重大国际意义的大会。它受到全世界进步人士的关心和欢迎，也引起了苏联和人类进步事业的敌人的注意和仇视。
    在大会期间和大会闭幕以后，国际反动派又开动他们的报纸、刊物和通讯社等等的宣传机器，不断地放出那一套腐臭不堪的陈词滥调，来攻击大会和苏联文学，说什么大会开得“阴风惨惨”（法国《费加罗文学报》），什么苏联文学没有创作“自由”（法国《世界报》、《法兰西观察家》等），什么苏联作家只能“按照共产党的命令”写作（美国《纽约时报》）等等。
    我国代表团团长茅盾同志，在向大会致祝词的时候，曾经引用了我国一句谚语来形容前几年国际反动派和修正主义分子对苏联文学的攻击。这句谚语，后来大会期间在人们口头上和苏联报纸上被一再引用。他说：
    “而敌人的恶意攻击的结果如何呢？正像中国的一句谚语所说的：‘蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量。’敌人的企图完全落空，苏联文学则依然像高峰一般屹立不动。”
    很显然，敌人这次的企图，同以往任何一次一样，依然要完全落空。他们的污蔑和攻击，不仅丝毫无损于大会的成功和苏联文学的强大，而且恰恰从反面来证实了大会取得的胜利以及这种胜利对敌人又是一次多么沉重的打击。
    在第三次全苏作家代表大会上，最激动人心的是高度集中表现了党和作家之间的亲密无间的关系。苏联共产党对苏联作家的创作劳动给予了那么高的估价，给予了那么亲切的关怀，在伟大的共产主义事业中赋予了他们以那么崇高的地位，把他们当作帮助党对劳动人民进行共产主义教育的可靠的助手，把他们称为为前进扫清道路的远射程炮兵。而苏联作家也向党表现了那么坚贞不渝的忠诚，和人民一起紧紧地团结在党的周围，那么全心全意地立志要以实际的行动，“用劳动、灵感、技巧、事业来报答党对他们的崇高的信任”（《大会向苏共中央致敬词》），拿出所有的力量来为党和人民的伟大事业效劳！
    大家知道，对苏联文学，——对其他社会主义国家的文学也是如此，——敌人最痛恨，因此多少年来千方百计地妄图破坏，近年来还利用了现代修正主义分子来进攻的（尽管每次都失败），正就是苏联作家这种对党的忠诚以及他们同党的这种亲密关系。敌人总是嚷嚷不休地叫嚣：这样，作家就没有创作“自由”，因此就“写不出好作品”，文学发展就要“停滞”。但是，在他们那里，作家究竟怎样“自由”，他们究竟写出了什么“好”作品，他们的文学究竟“繁荣”到了什么地步，——所有这些，我们早已领教过。在这次苏联作家代表大会上，许多作家，包括西方国家的作家在内，又作了彻底的揭露。
    美国作家鲍诺斯基作了深刻的描绘。他说：“统治阶级追求战争、奴役和人民渴望和平、民主之间的矛盾把整个美国的生活歪曲了。因此我们的青年精神衰退，人们浑浑噩噩的过日子，人们大批大批的神经衰弱。……许多作家也是苦恼万分，但是闹不清楚是怎么回事。他们这种情绪也可以从他们的作品里面看出来。悲观，绝望，对人失去信心，嘲笑进步，讽刺社会主义思想，病态的苦恼的色情，颓废等等，——这就是正在迅速地变得衰老和惊慌失措的年轻的美国的凄惨景象。”在这样糜烂的空气和堕落的精神状态下，资产阶级文学必然进一步加深它的分化和衰颓的过程。至于在西方帝国主义世界以及它们势力所及的其他国家里洪水似的泛滥着的那种所谓美国“文化”，例如宣传战争、鼓励杀人放火、诲盗诲淫的连环图画和书刊、电影和电视，疯狂的阿飞舞和呼拉圈舞，以至于猩猩“作画”和小猫“唱曲子”等等的玩意儿，那早已不能算是什么“艺术”，而不过是反动统治阶级豢养了一批“文化”制造商贩卖出来麻醉、腐蚀和残害人们头脑的毒品。
    但是，在西方资本主义世界，继承着本国优秀的文化传统和代表着本国人民的意志的进步的和有正义感的作家，正在一天天多起来。有不少资产阶级作家，在残酷的现实中摸索到了真理，而走上了进步的，甚至共产主义的道路。也有不少抱有相当的民主情绪和正义感的作家正在歧途上苦闷和徬徨。这些作家，他们在自己的祖国是享受不到自由创作、甚至自由行动的权利的。他们常常受到政治上和经济上各种各样的迫害。为了要在自己的作品里反映即使是一点点人民的和平、民主和独立的要求，就要冒着挨饿、坐牢、甚至杀头的危险。洪都拉斯作家阿马亚—阿马多拉在大会上说，“资本主义阶层是用中世纪宗教裁判所式的手段来对付进步文学的。在危地马拉，当它遭受到美国暴力干涉的时候，就发生过这样的情况。”在洪都拉斯，阿马亚—阿马多拉说，接触到社会问题的现实主义作品常常受到抵制，不让它们流传到群众中去。他自己写的反映美国“联合果品公司”香蕉园农业工人生活的《绿地狱》和以建筑工人生活为题材的《建设者》就受到过帝国主义分子的摧残。
    和西方资产阶级反动文学的极端腐朽没落成为鲜明对照的，是真正自由的苏联文学的欣欣向荣。在两次代表大会期间的四年中，据苏尔科夫的报告说，苏联国内出版的苏联作品增加了一半以上，印数增加了差不多四分之三。而且大会指出，在这四年中间，出现了许多具有高度思想艺术水平的杰作，其中特别值得注意的是苏联各民族文学的迅速成长和新作家的大批出现。苏联文学在国外的传布和影响也正在日益扩大。据苏联批评家捷林斯基说，四年来在国外用四十八种外国文字出版了九百二十二个苏联作家的二千多种作品。如果把各国用不同文字出版的相同作品也算在内，总数就达五千三百种之多。就是说，在国外平均每天出版两、三种苏联作品。这仅仅是在数量上表现的苏联文学的巨大成就。更重要的是苏联文学以丰富的思想内容和优美的艺术形式在生活上和美学上给予国内国外读者的影响，那是很难作出具体而充分的估计了。
    苏联文学的成就和贡献是很大的，但是苏联作家一点也没有因此而骄傲自满。他们深深体会到，用费定在6月15日莫斯科作家大会上说的话来说，党交给他们的任务是重大而光荣的，但也不是那么容易完成的。党中央在祝词里明确地指出：“苏联作家面临的光荣任务是积极地促进未来的人、新生活的建设者的精神面貌的形成。苏联作家的使命是用共产主义思想教育他们，培养他们崇高的道德品质以及对资产阶级思想和道德采取不可容忍的态度”，“苏联作家的崇高使命是真实而鲜明地表现人民劳动功绩的壮美以及为共产主义而进行的斗争的雄壮和伟大，做七年计划的热情的宣传员，鼓舞起苏联人心里的朝气和干劲，根除人们意识中的资本主义残余，帮助扫除还在阻挠我们前进的一切障碍。”如何完成这样重大而光荣的任务，怎样更进一步深入生活，与伟大的时代并驾齐驱，提高艺术技巧，创造出更多更好的与时代相称的作品来，就是这次大会热烈讨论的中心。
    大会代表们一致认为，现在苏联人民在共产党领导下进入了伟大共产主义建设七年计划的第一年，他们在壮丽的和平劳动中表现了史无前例的英雄气概。这是一个伟大的英雄的时代。作家必须体会到这种豪迈和壮丽的时代气息，在他们的作品里把时代的英雄气概和它的革命功业的宏伟气魄充分表现出来。描写这样空前未有的新的时代和新的世界，新的人物和新的关系，担任时代最崇高和最先进的思想的宣扬者，充当世界上一切最美好的事物的歌手，——是苏联作家最大的幸福。大会把反映现代的任务提得很高，认为这是苏联文学的灵魂，它现在已经成为极其重要的政治、艺术、美学的要求。大会有力地批判了前一个时期出现的“距离”论和“永恒”主题说（注）的错误观点，认为反映现代，不但不会限制艺术家的活动，相反地会扩大他们的视野，加深他们对现实生活的认识，增强他们同人民生活的联系，促使作家在选择题材、体裁以及艺术手法等等方面充分发挥他们的才能。正确地理解和实现反映现代生活的要求，将促使苏联文学推向新的思想和艺术的高峰。但是，大会也指出，现代题材不能在时间上作机械的划分，因为现代生活中的许多重大现象和过去的历史都是密切联系着的。
    为了真实地反映英雄的时代，必须创造英雄人物的形象。代表们认为，创造我们时代的高贵的英雄人物的形象，让他们成为引导人们前进的模范，——这是苏联文学最重要的任务。苏联人民演员奥赫洛普科夫在发言中引述了高尔基在二十多年前说过的话：苏联人这样的英雄人物是历史上从未有过的。他们是那样的质朴，那样的明朗，又是那样的伟大。他们那种坚贞不屈和叛逆的精神比过去所有的唐·吉呵德和浮士德不知道要高出多少倍。苏联作家应该把他们表现出来，帮助他们意识到自己就是这样的英雄人物。阿塞拜疆作家伊勃拉吉莫夫也说，苏联现代的英雄人物是那么多才多艺，精神世界是那么丰富。在思想崇高和感情丰富方面，同哈姆雷特，李尔王，法尔哈德等等比较起来，不仅毫无逊色，而且是大大地超过他们的。创造这样的人的形象，是作家无上的光荣！
    同人民生活保持密切联系，是深刻反映现代生活的土壤，这是赫鲁晓夫同志早在他两年前发表的著名论文《文学艺术要同人民生活保持密切的联系》里指出了。这次大会又强调了这个问题。巴什基里亚作家比克钦塔耶夫说，“向生活学习，好像逆水行舟，一不接触生活，就要落后。”很多发言者认为，作家应该响应党的号召，深入到人民创造活动最活跃的前方去，因为今天的英雄人物和英雄事迹就是在那里产生，新人的性格特征首先是在那里形成和发展，未来的面貌也是在那里可以最具体地感觉到。有些作家还指出，同人民生活在一起，应该成为作家自己内心的迫切要求，而不应该把它当作一种义务；同时对某些作家来说，问题还不仅仅是在哪里生活的问题，而是如何生活的问题。
    许多优秀的苏联作家是同人民生活保持着密切的联系的，他们的许多杰作都真实地反映了英雄的时代和英雄的人民。但是在苏联文学中，也出现一些作品，写得灰色和平庸，原始和猥琐，写得质量不高，甚至有粗制滥造的作风。这与英雄的时代和英雄的人民是不相称的。大会对这类作品的缺点作了概括性的分析和批判。许多作家着重指责了某些缺乏英雄的时代气息和贬低英雄人物的作品。有些作家常常避免采用鲜艳和歌颂的色彩，唯恐被责难为“粉饰”现实或者伪浪漫精神。但是要知道，歌颂英雄的现实，决不是出于单纯的主观愿望，而是为客观的英雄的现实本身所决定的。另外，也有些作家，还不能克服脱离时代和脱离冲突和激情的倾向，他们对现实作了田园诗式的描写。他们不知道，苏联的优秀作品都是不仅描写了英雄功业，而且表现了英雄功业的产生和达到英雄功业的道路。创造就是斗争，任何创造都有冲突，不过现在的斗争和冲突有了新的意义。巨大的冲突，尖锐的矛盾，同强大敌人的搏斗，对巨大困难的克服，恰恰正是创造英雄人物形象最好的土壤，因为英雄人物就是从这些艰巨的斗争中产生出来的。
    反映现代生活和提高艺术技巧，是密切相关、不能分开的一个问题的两面。苏共中央祝词说得很清楚：“共产主义文学应该成为不仅思想内容丰富，而且艺术技巧高超的伟大的文学。伟大的思想要求高超的技巧，英雄的人物要求相当的艺术的体现。人民需要这样一种文学：它能用真实而优美的艺术形式培养和教育人们，它能在精神上充实他们，扩大他们的视野，表现人们在共产主义建设过程中觉悟的提高。我们的社会特别需要一种用鲜明的艺术手法来体现现代迫切题材的文学。”因此，大会要求作家严格对待自己的创作，钻研艺术技巧，提高作品质量。赫鲁晓夫同志引用作家索波列夫的话说：党和人民把一切都给了苏联作家，就是剥夺了写坏作品的权利，特别是写不真实的作品的权利。大会号召苏联作家响应党的号召，努力争取使苏联文学不仅在内容丰富上、而且在艺术技巧上成为世界第一。
    在讨论艺术技巧问题的时候，大会大力提倡苏联作家在社会主义现实主义的总原则之下，自由发挥个人创作才能的特点，大胆进行创作革新的探索以及实现艺术表现手法和风格流派的多样化。大会认为，苏联文学艺术的巨大成就证明，社会主义现实主义的方法是久经考验的、最有成效的苏联文学的主导的创作原则和战斗武器。它是苏联文学全部创作实践的概括，是苏联作家高举起来走向新的思想艺术高峰的战斗旗帜。它不仅不限制，相反地是给艺术家开辟了广大的天地，使他们能够在内容和形式上充分进行自由创作和发挥主动性。
    大会上许多作家对创作革新的问题进行了广泛而深入的探讨。代表们认为，现在苏联一切生活领域里正在那么顽强地进行创造性的探索，在文学的领域里也应该进行大胆而智慧的探索。苏联作家在对现代生活进行研究和思考的时候，同时必须探索新的表现形式。作品的思想，必须通过艺术技巧的熔炉的提炼，才能具体化和感染人们。而最先进和最人道的新思想，充满英雄气概的新现实，必须用旗鼓相当的最新颖、最先进的艺术手法来体现。苏联文学不仅在内容上而且在艺术上也是全新的。它的革新是真正的艺术革新，同西方流行的各式各样现代派的形式主义的革“新”有着本质上的区别。后者是脱离人民和生活，是缺乏社会意义的。前者却是以人民性和真实性为基础，它的根子深深地生长在生活和社会里。同时，新的内容也不是可以套用任何一种新的形式的。新的形式不仅要同内容相适应，而且要同民族的特点，作家本人的气质和创作个性相一致。苏联的每一个民族和每一个作家都应该在创造自己独特的风格方面作出贡献来。至于俄罗斯、苏联各民族和世界古典文学的优秀传统，当然还是要继承和发扬，这是有助于革新的探索的。而且永远不停地探索新的内容和新的艺术表现手法，正是最优秀、最先进和最革命的传统之一。
    艺术表现手法和风格流派的多样化，是许多发言者关心的问题。在讨论这个问题的时候，有十几位代表对革命的浪漫精神的问题发表了意见。有的说，现在是革命的英雄的时代。为了表现苏联人民的优秀品质，需要一种思想深刻和色彩鲜艳的文学。有的说，为了以过去的革命传统和今天的英雄精神来教育青年一代，文学作品必须充满革命浪漫主义的精神。有的说，现在有些作家对英雄的现实采取了爬行的态度，因此在他们的作品里丧失了崇高的热情，丧失了真正的艺术所必不可少的英雄精神和浪漫精神，而为一种经验主义和平淡的现实主义所支配着。没有浪漫精神，没有远大的理想，社会主义现实主义就显得贫乏。浪漫精神不是作家的奇思怪想，而是他们对世界的体会和他们的创作个性的表现，所以是能够表现真实的人民精神和民族性格的。在苏联文学里，浪漫精神有着多种多样的表现形式。在有些作家的作品里，这种风格表现得比较强烈。在俄罗斯、苏联各民族和世界古典文学中，有着优秀的浪漫主义传统。苏联文学必须把它们继承下来，加以发扬。也有的发言者说，浪漫精神的风格是以现实为基础的，不能过分强调，更不能因此而减弱对现实主义的注意和信任，现实主义已经确定为苏联文学的艺术发展的主要路线。
    对于苏联作家来说，“这次大会，”正如吉洪诺夫在闭幕词里说的那样，“仅仅是一个开始。当由于出席大会而兴起的那种激动平静下来的时候，我们又将兴起另一种激动：那就是创造性的、富有灵感的、抓住人心的那种激动——作家的劳动。”看了大会闭幕以来一个月中间苏联文学界活跃的景象，可以肯定地说，这种新的“激动”显然已经兴起来了。我们相信，在不久的将来，第三次全苏作家代表大会在苏联文学园地里播下的种子，一定将开出光辉灿烂的花朵来！
    〔注〕：“距离”论，全名是“距离灵感”论，意思是对事物在时间上保持一定的“距离”，才能产生创作的灵感。“距离”论者认为，现代生活中在你面前一晃而过的事物，不是立刻就能写出来的。如果要写，也写不好。唯有等事情过去好几年，作家对它有了深刻的体会之后，才能写出好作品来。这种似是而非的“理论”，实际上是为某些在创作上脱离生活和逃避当前重大问题的倾向辩护的。去年12月在俄罗斯共和国作家代表大会上，这种错误“理论”就已经受到过批评。“永恒”主题说认为，采取尖锐的所谓“暂时的”现代题材，是创造不出“永恒”的形象和写不出“不朽”的作品的。这种错误“理论”所得出的结论，和“距离”论相同，就是现代题材不能写。
