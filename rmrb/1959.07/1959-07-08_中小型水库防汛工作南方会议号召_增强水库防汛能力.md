Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 7th: The National Conference on Flood Control for Small and Medium-Sized Reservoirs (Southern Region), recently convened, has made arrangements for how to strengthen flood control work in small and medium-sized reservoirs in the southern regions, so that they can play a greater role in flood storage and prevention. The participating representatives also drafted a set of interim measures for flood control in small and medium-sized reservoirs.

Since liberation, and especially after the large-scale water conservancy construction of the past year, the number of small and medium-sized reservoirs across the country has increased significantly. After the completion of these reservoirs, the irrigated area has been expanded and flood control capacity has been enhanced, changing the past situation of flood control, which was transformed from point and line flood control to area flood control. However, because many of these reservoirs are newly built, widely distributed, and most have not been tested by floods, coupled with the fact that there are many heavy rainstorms in the southern summer and autumn rainy seasons, it is easy for dangers such as overtopping, breaching, seepage, and cracks to occur. In response to this situation, the conference required all regions to remain vigilant at all times, overcome complacency, strengthen leadership, establish and improve flood control agencies, conduct timely engineering inspections, and fully mobilize the masses, organize flood control teams, and prepare sufficient flood control materials to earnestly prepare for reservoir flood control.

The conference required all regions to actively create conditions for carrying out mass-based hydrological and meteorological intelligence, forecasting, and observation work for reservoirs. The conference also pointed out that in flood control for small and medium-sized reservoirs, it is necessary to implement the principle of "emphasizing storage," determine water storage measures for different periods based on engineering quality and hydrological and meteorological patterns, store less or not at all during periods of heavy rain, store more during periods of less rain, and seize the tail of the flood to store water to the predetermined water level at the end of the flood season, so as to prevent both floods and droughts and ensure a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

This conference was hosted by the Central Flood Control Headquarters in Wuhan, beginning on July 2nd and ending on July 5th. Participants included the heads of water conservancy departments from twelve provinces and regions, including Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, as well as representatives from the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, the Ministry of Agriculture, and water conservancy scientific research units.

    中小型水库防汛工作南方会议号召
    增强水库防汛能力
    新华社武汉7日电　南方各地如何加强中小型水库的防汛工作，使它们在蓄洪、防洪方面发挥更大作用，最近召开的全国中小型水库防汛会议南方会议对此已经作了布置。与会的代表们还拟定出了中小型水库防汛暂行办法的草案。
    解放以来，特别是经过去年大搞水利建设，全国中小型水库大量增加。这些水库建成后，扩大了灌溉面积，也增强了防洪能力，改变了历年来防汛工作的局面，即由过去的点线防汛扩大为面的防汛。但是，由于这些水库新建的多，分布广，大部分又未经过洪水考验，再加上南方夏秋雨季暴雨很多，因此，容易发生漫坝、溃口、渗漏、裂缝等险情，针对这种情况，会议要求各地必须随时提高警惕，克服麻痹思想，加强领导，建立与健全防汛机构，及时进行工程检查，并充分发动群众，组织防汛队伍，备足防汛器材，切实做好水库防汛准备。
    会议要求各地为水库上开展群众性的水文气象情报、预报和观测工作积极创造条件。会议还指出，在中小型水库防汛中，必须贯彻“以蓄为主”的方针，根据工程质量和水文气象规律，确定不同时期的蓄水措施，在暴雨多的时期少蓄或不蓄，雨少的时期多蓄，汛末则应抓住洪水尾巴蓄到预定的水位，做到防汛防旱两不误，保证今年农业丰收。
    这次会议是由中央防汛总指挥部主持在武汉召开的，7月2日开始，5日结束，参加会议的有湖南、湖北、广东、广西、浙江、福建、江苏、江西、安徽、云南、贵州、四川等十二个省、区的水利部门负责人，还有水利电力部、农业部和水利科学研究单位的代表。
