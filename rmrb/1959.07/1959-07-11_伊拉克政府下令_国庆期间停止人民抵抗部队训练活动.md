Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 9th. According to a report in "Al-Shaab" on the 9th, the Iraqi Military Governor, Abdi, has ordered the People's Resistance Forces to suspend their training activities during the Iraqi Revolution anniversary celebration week from July 5th to July 14th. It is reported that the People's Resistance Forces have already ceased carrying weapons and performing their duties of maintaining public order since the second half of June, according to orders.

The newspaper also reported that the Military Governor, in a recent notification issued to all police stations and substations, ordered them to arrest all "persons carrying weapons without special permission from the Military Governor's Office." Prior to this, the Military Governor had affirmed the validity of his first notification in his hundredth notification, which stipulated that the public were prohibited from carrying firearms and other weapons without special permission.

According to a report in "Al-Zaman" on the 7th, the Iraqi Cabinet approved a law regarding public gatherings and demonstrations. The law stipulates that assembly is free within the bounds of the law. However, individuals and legally permitted political parties, trade unions, and other organizations must apply and notify the administrative authorities of the location and time before holding gatherings and demonstrations.

The law stipulates that the authorities have the right to reject applications "if it is proven that such gatherings or demonstrations will be against the Republic, or its democratic concepts, or against peace."

The Iraqi Republic also promulgated a decree on June 29th, ordering the retirement of six Iraqi Army officers, including Brigadier General Janabi, commander of the Second Division, on the advice of Defense Minister Qasim. Janabi was appointed as the commander of the Second Division after the Mosul rebellion in March of this year, replacing Brigadier General Tabakshali, who was implicated in the rebellion. Prime Minister Qasim issued a notification on the evening of the 6th, announcing a "15% reduction in sentences for all military and civilian criminals."

The notification said that this measure was taken in order to "allow our fellow prisoners to participate in the upcoming grand celebration of the July 14th (Revolution Anniversary)."

Military Governor Abdi published a notification in "Al-Shaab" on the 6th, addressed to various government departments, regarding the reinstatement of those who had been dismissed for political reasons in the past. The notification said: "Due to the needs of public interest, we have previously detained and exiled some citizens, but we released them when these reasons no longer existed." Now "we do not object to their reinstatement."

    伊拉克政府下令
    国庆期间停止人民抵抗部队训练活动
    新华社巴格达9日电  据“国民报”9日报道，伊拉克军事长官阿卜迪已经命令人民抵抗部队在从7月5日到7月14日伊拉克革命周年庆祝周期间停止它的训练活动。据悉，人民抵抗部队从6月下半月起就已经根据命令不再携带武器，并且不再执行他们维持公共治安的任务。
    这家报纸还报道，军事长官在最近向所有的警察局、派出所发出的一项通知中，命令它们逮捕所有“没有得到军事长官办公厅特别许可而携带武器的人”。在此以前，军事长官曾经在它发布的第一百号通告中，肯定了他的第一号通告的效力，第一号通告规定，无特别许可，禁止人民携带火器和其它武器。
    据“时代报”7日报道，伊拉克内阁批准了一项关于公共集会和示威游行的法律。这项法律规定，在法律范围内集会是自由的。但是个人和得到法律许可的政党组织、工会和其他组织在举行集会和示威游行以前，必须先提出申请，并且把地点和时间通知行政当局。
    这项法律规定，当局有权拒绝申请，“如果证明这种集会或示威游行将是反对共和国，或它的民主概念，或反对和平的话”。
    伊拉克共和国还在6月29日公布一项法令，根据国防部长卡塞姆的劝告命令第二师师长贾纳比准将等六名伊拉克陆军军官退职。贾纳比是在今年3月摩苏尔叛乱事件发生以后被任命为第二师师长，来代替与这次叛乱有牵连的塔巴克沙利准将的职务的。卡塞姆总理6日晚上曾发表通告，宣布把“一切军人和非军人的罪犯减刑15％。”
    通告说，采取这个措施是为了“使我们的同胞犯人参加即将来到的7月14日的（革命周年）大庆”。
    军事长官阿卜迪6日在“国民报”上发表了给政府各部门发出的关于过去因政治原因而被开除的人可以复职的通知。通知说：“根据公共利益的需要，过去我们曾拘禁和流放了一些公民，但是当这些原因不再存在以后我们释放了他们”。现在“我们不反对让他们复职”。
