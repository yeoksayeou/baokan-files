    A New Look for Prague
    By Yang Yi, Our Correspondent
    Sparse red paths, green-covered mountains, summer has arrived in Prague. Here you don't feel the heat of high summer, nor do you have to worry about the severe cold of winter. Chinese people living in Prague easily reminisce about Kunming in their homeland. The gentle climate, charming scenery, exquisite architecture, and ancient relics have for centuries made people use the most splendid words and the most moving poems to praise Prague's charm.
    However, in this outwardly peaceful and quiet city, as long as you observe carefully, it is not difficult to discover the atmosphere of boiling socialist life. Prague, like other parts of Czechoslovakia, is a highly industrialized city. Of its population of over 980,000, the number of employees accounts for almost half, and even 42% of women participate in work.
    Prague is not only the political, economic, and cultural heart of Czechoslovakia, but also one of Czechoslovakia's industrial centers, especially an important base for its machinery manufacturing industry. Here, large numbers of machine tools, diesel engines, power station equipment, steam boilers, telecommunications equipment, train carriages, as well as airplanes, automobiles, motorcycles, etc., well-known to the Chinese people, are produced every day. Prague also has a not-so-small food and textile industry, and brews the renowned "Smíchov" beer.
    In the new year of 1959, the working class of Prague, inspired by the general line of completing socialist construction put forward by the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, devoted themselves to the fiery peaceful labor with doubled enthusiasm. Now, 282 work teams have participated in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." In the first five months, various factories in Prague overfulfilled their production plans, providing the country with an additional 960,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, 651 tons of steel, nearly 200 trucks and more than 300 motorcycles, as well as 1,300 diesel engines and more than 1,600 sets of television equipment.
    When you stroll through the suburbs of Prague, the first thing that catches your eye is a thriving construction scene. Employees of the Capital Housing Construction Company will add 3,500 economical and comfortable residences for residents this year. During World War II, 38,000 houses in Prague were destroyed by the war. After the war, not only were these houses completely repaired, but 22,000 new houses were built. Now, according to the decisions of the Party and the government, construction workers will also build about 90,000 new homes here by 1970 to meet the housing needs of the capital's residents.
    Because Prague's population has increased by more than a quarter in the past decade, and also because of its high degree of industrialization and extremely high employment rate, the Municipal People's Committee attaches great importance to doing a good job in providing services to residents. In the next two years, Prague's repair industry will increase by 70%. Next year, a huge, all-encompassing "Service Palace" will be erected in the city center, with all departments serving families, especially housewives.
    The city's commercial network is also being further adjusted to better serve the citizens. In the near future, each district will set up its own commercial center, where people can choose and buy all the goods they need. In order to save customers' time, the form of unmanned sales will be further expanded. In the food industry alone, 50 more unmanned stores will be added this year. It is expected that by 1965, three-quarters of the entire retail industry will adopt unmanned and automatic vending. At the same time, specialized stores with a wide variety of goods will also be established more universally to meet customers' different preferences.
    Prague is a beautiful city where ancient style and modern facilities coexist. On the one hand, it has a long history of 1,300 years, preserving the magnificent buildings of various historical periods, with many castles and churches. Here are the Prague Castle, built for a thousand years, and the Charles Bridge with a history of more than 600 years; at the same time, it also provides residents with the latest medical, educational and cultural facilities. In Prague, there is an average of one hospital bed for every hundred people and one doctor for every six hundred people. In this city with a population of less than one million, there are twelve institutions of higher learning and two hundred and sixty-nine primary and secondary schools, and more than two hundred and fifty nurseries and kindergartens. Here, eighteen museums, ninety-three libraries, twenty-two theaters, and seventy-nine cinemas are open all year round, doing everything possible to meet the people's high demand for cultural life.
    Every morning, as the sun rises, you can see hundreds and thousands of people rushing to work. When the sun sets, the bustling Wenceslas Square will be crowded with people walking and shopping after get off work. Late at night, when theaters and cinemas close, you will also encounter a large number of well-dressed workers and shop assistants pouring out of the entrance. They work so hard and live such a good life. When you talk to them, you will also find how firm and optimistic their belief in life is, and how indescribably warm and kind they are to others. At this time, you will naturally think of the praise of Prague and the love for the people described by Czechoslovak national hero Julius Fučík in his masterpiece. (Attached picture)

    布拉格的新面貌
    本报记者　杨翊
    小径红稀，山城绿遍，仲夏来到了布拉格。在这里你感觉不到盛夏的炎热，也不必耽心严冬的酷寒。居住在布拉格的中国人，很容易由此怀念起祖国的昆明。和熙的气候，迷人的景色，精巧的建筑，古老的文物，使得千百年来人们一直用最华丽的词句和最动人的吟咏来颂扬布拉格的风姿。
    但是，在这个外表安详宁静的城市里，只要你细心观察一下，就不难发现沸腾的社会主义生活的气息。布拉格像捷克斯洛伐克其他地区一样，是一个高度工业化的城市，在九十八万多人口中，职工人数几乎占了一半，就连妇女也有42％参加了工作。
    布拉格不仅是捷克斯洛伐克的政治、经济和文化的心脏，而且也是捷克斯洛伐克工业中心之一，特别是它的机器制造业的一个重要基地。这里每天大批生产中国人民所熟知的大型车床、柴油引擎、电站设备、蒸汽锅炉、电讯装备、火车车厢以及飞机、汽车、摩托车等。布拉格还有规模不算小的食品和纺织工业，并酿造负有盛名的“斯密霍夫”啤酒。
    在新的1959年中，布拉格的工人阶级，在捷共第十一次代表大会所提出的、完成社会主义建设的总路线的鼓舞下，以加倍的热情投身于火热的和平劳动中，现在已有二百八十二个工作队参加了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛。在头五个月中，布拉格各个工厂超额完成了自己的生产计划，为国家多提供了九十六万度电，六百五十一吨钢，近二百部载重汽车和三百多部摩托车，以及一千三百部柴油发动机和一千六百多套电视设备。
    当你漫步在布拉格的市郊时，映入眼帘的首先是一片兴旺的建设景象。首都房屋建筑公司的职工们，今年将为居民们增添三千五百套经济而舒适的住宅。在第二次世界大战期间，布拉格曾有三万八千套房屋被毁于战火，战后不仅这些房屋被完全修复，而且新修了两万二千套住宅。现在根据党和政府的决议，到1970年时，建筑工人们还将在这里增修约九万套住房，用来满足首都居民对房屋的需要。
    由于布拉格的人口十年来增加了四分之一以上，也由于它的高度工业化和极高的就业比例，因此市人民委员会十分重视作好对居民的服务事业。今后两年中布拉格的修理性行业将增加70％，明年在市中心将矗立起一座包罗万象的巨大的“服务宫”，设有一切为家庭、特别是为主妇服务的部门。
    城市的商业网也正在进一步调整，以便更好为市民们服务。在不久的将来，每一区都将设立自己的商业中心，人们能从那里选购他所需要的一切商品。为了节省顾客的时间，无人售货的形式将进一步扩大。单是食品业，今年就将再增设五十个无人售货商店。预计到1965年时整个零售业商店的四分之三都要采行无人售货和自动售货。与此同时，货物品种繁多的专业性商店也将更普遍设立，以适应顾客们的不同爱好。
    布拉格是一个古老风格和现代设施兼容并存的美丽城市。它一方面有着一千三百年的悠久历史，保存着各个历史时期的雄伟建筑，城堡云集，教堂林立，这里有修建千年的布拉格城堡和拥有六百多年历史的查理士大桥；同时它也为居民们提供最新式的医疗、教育和文化设备。在布拉格，平均每一百人就有一个病床，每六百人有一位医生。在这人口不满百万的城市里，设有十二所高等院校和二百六十九所中小学校，有二百五十多个托儿所与幼儿园。在这里，十八座博物馆、九十三家图书馆、二十二座剧院和七十九家电影院全年开放着，尽一切可能满足人民对文化生活的高度需求。
    每天早晨，当旭日初升时，你可看到成百上千的人匆匆赶赴工作地点。当夕阳西垂时，繁华的瓦茨拉夫大街会拥塞着下班后散步和选购物品的人群。深夜，当戏院和电影院散场时，你也会碰到从门口涌出的大批衣着讲究的工人和店员。他们工作是如此辛勤、生活是这样美好。在你同他们交谈时，你还会发现他们对生活的信念是多么坚定而乐观，他们待人又是这样难以表述的热诚和亲切，每当这时，你会很自然地联想到：捷克斯洛伐克民族英雄伏契克在他的名著中所描写过的对布拉格的赞扬和对人们的热爱。（附图片）
