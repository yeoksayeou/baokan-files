Organizing Teacher In-Service Training According to Individual Needs
Chongqing Adopts Concrete Measures to Improve the Teaching Level of Primary School Teachers

    (Our report) Chongqing's education departments have taken various measures to help primary school teachers improve their teaching level and professional abilities.

    In recent years, primary school education in Chongqing has developed rapidly, and the number of teachers has increased rapidly. In the urban area alone, from 1953 to 1959, the number of public primary schools increased by twenty-one, and the number of private primary schools tripled. The number of teachers increased from several hundred to more than 1,900. New teachers lacked teaching experience and basic knowledge, failing to meet the needs of actual work development. The education departments studied this situation, grasped the basic link of fundamentally improving teachers' political level and basic teaching knowledge, and established four types of professional in-service training organizations according to teachers' different cultural levels and different needs. One type is to select a group of teachers with higher levels and rich teaching experience to go to the Teacher In-Service Training College. Because most of these teachers are the main force among teachers, they are busy with work and have heavy tasks. Therefore, the in-service training method is mainly correspondence, and the course content is more specialized. Another type is like the urban intermediate-level spare-time training school, whose training targets are teachers with relatively low original cultural levels. The training content mainly includes basic courses such as Chinese and arithmetic, with four hours of centralized classes per week. In order not to affect teaching work and to suit the different needs of each teacher, methods such as rotating classes and batch-by-batch in-service training are adopted, and there are categories such as single-subject in-service training, double-subject in-service training, and multi-subject in-service training. For some new teachers with lower cultural levels and lack of basic teaching knowledge, especially teachers in private primary schools, short-term training courses have been generally held in various districts of Chongqing, focusing on learning the necessary basic courses. The training course in Jiulongpo District, in addition to courses such as Chinese, arithmetic, and basic teaching knowledge, also has observation classes and practice classes. The training course generally lasts for one or two months per term.

    In order to take care of the needs of different teachers, some units have also organized in-service training groups. The kindergarten teachers' in-service training group of the Municipal Construction Company often holds lectures on early childhood education knowledge according to the characteristics of their work, and invites teachers from the preschool education major of Southwest Normal College to give lectures to systematically improve their knowledge. Shapingba District also adopted the method of organizing teachers to attend classes at nearby normal schools to improve their professional level. In this way, more than 60% of the city's teachers participated in various in-service training organizations to learn various basic courses. In addition, Chongqing also adopted the method of giving play to the role of inter-school joint teaching and research groups, with old teachers leading new teachers, and providing teachers with practical help for specific problems in teaching work.

    因人制宜组织教师进修
    重庆采取具体措施提高小学教师教学水平
    本报讯　重庆市教育部门采取多种措施，帮助小学教师提高教学水平和业务能力。
    几年来，重庆市小学教育发展很快，教师数量迅速增加，仅城区从1953年到1959年，公立小学就增加了二十一所，民办小学增加了三倍，教师数量由几百人增加到一千九百多人。新教师教学经验不够，缺乏基础知识，不能满足实际工作发展的需要。教育部门研究了这种情况，抓住从根本上提高教师的政治水平和教学基础知识这一基本环节，根据教师不同的文化水平，不同的需要，建立了四种业务进修组织。一种是挑选一批水平较高具有丰富的教学经验的教师到教师进修学院。这部分教师，因为大部分是教师中的主力，工作忙，任务重，所以在进修方式上基本以函授为主，课程内容比较专门。另一种是像城区的中级业余进修学校，培养对象是原来文化程度不太高的教师，进修内容主要是语文、算术等基本课程，每周集中上课四小时；为了不影响教学工作和适合各个教师的不同需要，采取轮流上课和分批进修的办法，在种类上又有单科进修、双科进修和多科进修等类别。对于一些文化程度较低、缺乏教学基本知识的新教师，特别是民办小学的教师，重庆市各区都普遍举办了短期训练班，集中学习必需的基本课程。九龙坡区的训练班，除了设有语文、算术、教学基本知识等课程外，还有见习课和实习课。训练班每期一般是一两个月。
    为了照顾不同教师的需要，一些单位还组织了进修组。市建筑公司的幼儿园教师进修组，根据工作特点经常举行幼儿教育知识讲座，请西南师范学院学前教育专业的教师讲课，系统地提高。沙坪坝区还采取组织教师到附近的师范学校听课的办法，来提高教师们的业务水平。这样全市60％以上的教师都参加了各种进修组织，学习各种基础课程。此外，重庆市还采取了发挥校际联合教研组的办法，以老教师带新教师，针对教学工作中的具体问题，给教师以切实的帮助。
