Commentary on Mr. Lloyd's Letter
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    British Foreign Secretary Mr. Lloyd wrote to our Foreign Minister Chen Yi on June 22, replying to the two letters that Foreign Minister Chen sent to the two chairmen (Soviet Union and Britain) of the Geneva Conference on the Laotian issue on February 18 and May 25. Regrettably, Mr. Lloyd's letter not only did not express a desire to take effective measures with relevant countries to stop the United States and the Laotian Royal Government from violating the Geneva Accords and undermining peace in Indochina, but also distorted the truth.

    Mr. Lloyd's letter did its best to defend the actions of the United States and the Laotian Royal Government in undermining the Geneva Accords, saying that the Laotian government "not only did not violate the Geneva Accords, but has been sincerely trying to incorporate the two former Lao battalions into the Lao army in accordance with the agreement reached with the Lao Patriotic Front in November 1957." However, the facts are exactly the opposite. The Lao army groundlessly ordered the disarmament of these two battalions on May 11 and launched an armed attack on them on May 23, thereby provoking the civil war in Laos.

    In this way, the Laotian Royal Government not only violated the agreement on incorporating the former Lao combat forces into the Royal Army, but also violated the entire Vientiane Agreement. On May 13, the Laotian Royal Government further ordered the surveillance and house arrest of the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and former Lao combat forces, including Prince Souphanouvong. According to the "Khuang Lao Patriotic News," this illegal act by the Laotian Royal Government is currently intensifying, rather than "no longer needing to be maintained," as Mr. Lloyd stated in his reply. Prior to this, a large number of members of the Lao Patriotic Front were persecuted by the Royal Government, and the coalition government established under the Vientiane Agreement with representatives of the former Lao combat forces was overthrown.

    These serious acts of undermining the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreement were carried out with the participation and instigation of the United States government. After the Sananikone government announced on February 11 that it was no longer bound by the Geneva Accords, US State Department officials openly stated that the United States could thereafter "freely" send military missions to Laos. Former US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson once bluntly stated that the United States and the Laotian Royal Government "finally agreed on a reform plan. Now let's take a look at today's situation, they expelled two Communists in the government (referring to the representatives of the former Lao combat forces)." US officials even openly admitted that the United States had illegally imported a large number of weapons and military personnel into Laos, disregarding the strict prohibition of the Geneva Accords and the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos. The US State Department has also constantly clamored to turn Laos into an "anti-communist fortress" of the United States, to make Laos oppose patriotic and democratic forces domestically, abandon peaceful neutrality internationally, and join the military aggression groups planned by the United States, turning Laos into a US military base and a tool for undermining peace in Indochina and the Far East.

    These conspiracies of US imperialism have been confirmed by a series of words and deeds of the Sananikone government. Lao Army Chief of Staff Rathikoun has publicly clamored that Laos is within the "defense" scope of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and demanded that this aggressive group intervene in the Vietnam-Laos border dispute, attempting to introduce the military forces of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization into Laos. At the same time, the Laotian Royal Government colluded with and condoned the Chiang Kai-shek remnant forces to continuously harass and sabotage the border areas of the People's Republic of China, directed the Tai puppet army of Diaowenlong, a former French "Expeditionary Force," to disrupt and invade the border areas of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Laotian army itself has also repeatedly invaded the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and created the Xiangli incident. The reactionary policy pursued by the United States and the Laotian Royal Government of tearing up the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreement is leading the current internal situation and foreign relations of Laos towards an increasingly dangerous path. Lao Foreign Minister Phagna and Thai Foreign Minister Khoman issued a joint statement on May 29, saying that Laos has the right to participate in any international or regional organization.

    The Geneva Accords are the foundation of peace and security in Indochina. If the United States is allowed to collude with the Laotian Royal Government to tear up the Geneva Accords, turning Laos into a US military base and tool for aggression, not only will Laos' national independence and domestic peaceful reunification be completely destroyed, but the peace and security of Indochina and Southeast Asia will also be seriously threatened. Therefore, the governments and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, and other relevant countries have repeatedly expressed serious concern about the dangerous situation in Laos.

    Faced with the current situation in Laos, the British government, as a participating country in the Geneva Conference, especially as one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, if it has the desire to cooperate with other relevant countries to maintain peace in Indochina, it should have taken a positive and responsible attitude together with the other chairman country, the Soviet Union, to stop the destructive actions of the United States and the Laotian authorities and maintain the Geneva Accords. At least it could work with the Soviet Union to promote the resumption of the supervisory activities of the International Commission established by the Geneva Accords in Laos, instead of adopting the current attitude of distorting the facts, sitting idly by as the situation in Laos deteriorates, and defending the actions of the United States and the Laotian authorities in undermining the Geneva Accords. It is especially surprising that the British government even described the resumption of activities of the Laotian International Commission as interference in Laotian internal affairs. However, the British government clearly knows that the entire activity of the Laotian International Commission is precisely to maintain the Geneva Accords and peace in Indochina. All countries participating in the Geneva Conference, first and foremost the Laotian Royal Government, have the obligation to abide by and maintain this international agreement, and no country is allowed to unilaterally abandon it. Therefore, the British government's argument is completely untenable. The British government's statement, as pointed out in the statement of the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on July 8, "is inconsistent with the facts occurring in Laos, and at the same time is inconsistent with the urgent desire to fulfill the Geneva Agreements on Laos." The British government's statement actually played a negative role in condoning and shielding the serious crimes of the United States and the Laotian authorities in undermining the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreement.

    We believe that as long as the British government is willing to face the facts instead of deliberately distorting and blurring the truth, then as one of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, it can and should take measures beneficial to easing the current tense situation in Laos in cooperation with the Soviet government and other relevant countries. On the contrary, if the British government continues to adopt an attitude of acquiescence and connivance towards the actions of the United States and the Laotian Royal Government in undermining the Geneva Accords, then the British government cannot shirk its responsibility for the continued deterioration of the situation in Laos.

    评劳埃德先生的信
    本报评论员
    英国外交大臣劳埃德6月22日写信给我国陈毅外交部长，答复陈外长2月18日和5月25日给日内瓦会议两主席（苏联和英国）关于老挝问题的两次去信。令人遗憾的是劳埃德先生的信不仅没有表示要同有关国家一起采取有效措施来制止美国和老挝王国当局违反日内瓦协议和破坏印度支那和平的行为的愿望，反而歪曲了事实的真相。
    劳埃德先生的信竭力为美国和老挝王国政府破坏日内瓦协议的行为辩护，说什么老挝政府“不仅没有违反日内瓦协议，而是一直真诚地试图按照他们在1957年11月和寮国达成的协议，把那两个前寮国营编入老挝陆军。”但是，事实恰恰相反，老挝陆军于5月11日无端下令解除这两个营的武装，并且于5月23日发动了对这两个营的武装进攻，从而挑起了老挝的内战。
    这样，老挝王国政府不仅违反了关于将前寮国战斗部队编入王国军队的协议，而且违反了整个万象协议。5月13日，老挝王国政府进一步下令监视和软禁包括苏发努冯亲王在内的老挝爱国战线党和前寮国战斗部队的领导人员。据“川圹老挝爱国报”揭露，老挝王国政府的这种非法行为目前正在变本加厉，而不是像劳埃德先生复信中所说：“已不需再维持下去”了。在此以前，老挝爱国战线党大批党员受到王国政府的迫害，根据万象协议成立的有前寮国战斗部队代表参加的联合政府也竟被推翻。
    这些严重破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为，都是在美国政府参与和指使下进行的。在萨纳尼空政府于2月11日宣布不再受日内瓦协议约束以后，美国国务院官员就公开声称，美国在此以后可以“自由地”向老挝派遣军事使团了。美国前助理国务卿罗伯逊曾经直认不讳地说，美国和老挝王国当局“最后商定了一个改革计划。现在让我们看一看今天的情况吧，他们驱除了两名在政府中的共产党人（按指前寮国战斗部队的代表）”。美国的官方人士更公开承认，美国曾经不顾日内瓦协议和关于在老挝停止敌对行动协定的严格禁止，非法地向老挝输入大量武器和军事人员。美国国务院更不断叫嚣要将老挝变成一个美国的“反共堡垒”，要老挝在国内反对爱国民主力量，在国际上放弃和平中立，参加美国策划的军事侵略集团，变老挝为美国的军事基地和破坏印度支那与远东和平的工具。
    美帝国主义的这些阴谋策划，已经为萨纳尼空政府的一系列言行所证实。老挝陆军参谋长拉提曲耳曾经公然叫嚷老挝是在东南亚侵略集团的“防御”范围之内，要求这个侵略集团出面干涉越南—老挝边境纠纷事件，企图借此把东南亚侵略集团的军事力量引入老挝。与此同时，老挝王国当局勾结和纵容蒋介石残余武装不断对中华人民共和国的边境地区进行骚扰破坏活动，指挥前法“远征军”的傣族伪军刁文龙部扰乱和侵犯越南民主共和国边境地区，老挝陆军自己也曾多次侵犯越南民主共和国边境，并制造了向立事件。美国和老挝王国当局所奉行的撕毁日内瓦协议和万象协议的反动政策，正使目前老挝的内部局势和对外关系走向越来越危险的道路。老挝外交大臣班雅和泰国外交部长科曼5月29日就曾经发表联合声明，说老挝有权参加任何国际性的或区域性的组织。
    日内瓦协议是印度支那和平和安全的基础。如果听任美国勾结老挝王国当局撕毁日内瓦协议，使老挝变为美国的军事基地和侵略工具，不仅老挝的民族独立和国内和平统一将被彻底破坏，而且印度支那和东南亚地区的和平和安全也将遭到严重的威胁。因此，越南民主共和国、中国和其他有关各国的政府和人民对老挝的险恶局势一再表示了严重的关切。
    面对目前老挝的情况，作为日内瓦会议的参与国，特别是作为日内瓦会议的主席国之一的英国政府，如果它有同其他有关国家合作以维护印度支那和平的愿望，它本来应该同另一个主席国苏联一道采取积极负责的态度，制止美国和老挝当局的破坏行为，维护日内瓦协议。至少它可以同苏联一起，促使日内瓦协议规定建立的国际委员会恢复在老挝的监察和监督活动，而不是采取现在这种违反事实的态度，坐视老挝局势日趋恶化，并且为美国和老挝当局破坏日内瓦协议的行为辩护。尤其令人惊奇的是，英国政府竟然把老挝国际委员会的恢复活动说成是对老挝内政的干涉。但是，英国政府明明知道，老挝国际委员会的全部活动正是为了维护日内瓦协议和印度支那的和平。所有参加日内瓦会议的国家，首先是老挝王国政府，都负有遵守与维护这一国际协议的义务，不容任何国家片面废弃。因此，英国政府的论点是完全站不住脚的。英国政府的这种说法正如越南民主共和国外交部发言人在7月8日的声明中所指出，“是同在老挝发生的事实不符合的，同时也是同迫切要求履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议的愿望不相符合的。”英国政府的这种说法对美国和老挝当局破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的严重罪行实际上起了包庇和纵容的恶劣作用。
    我们认为，只要英国政府愿意面对事实，而不是故意歪曲和模糊事实的真相，那么作为日内瓦会议两主席之一，它是能够而且也应当在同苏联政府和其他有关国家的合作之下采取有利于和缓当前老挝紧张局势的措施的。反之，如果英国政府对于美国和老挝王国政府破坏日内瓦协议的行为仍然采取默许和纵容的态度，那么英国政府对于老挝局势继续恶化是不能辞其咎的。
