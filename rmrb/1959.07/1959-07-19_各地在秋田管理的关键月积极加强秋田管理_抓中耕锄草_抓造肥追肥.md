Xinhua News Agency, 18th. After the work of crash summer sowing basically ended in various regions, they have shifted their main forces to the autumn field management of autumn-ripening grain crops, oil crops, and cotton, such as cultivation, weeding, and topdressing. They are determined to grasp the management of autumn fields during the three months of July, August, and September, and strive for a bumper harvest in autumn agriculture.

Since July, rainfall in North China and Northeast China has gradually increased, and the drought in some areas has been relieved or eased. Seedlings are growing vigorously in various places, with thick stems and leaves, presenting a lush green scene. However, at the same time, weeds are also growing extremely fast, and it is very easy for weed infestations to occur. Cultivation, weeding, and other work have reached the most tense moment.

The Party committees in many regions have already strengthened their leadership over field management. At the beginning of July, the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference of secretaries of prefectural, municipal, and county committees, requiring all localities to vigorously grasp field management, concentrate their efforts to carry out intensive cultivation and weeding to prevent weed infestations, and called for a movement to upgrade third-class seedlings. The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, as well as the Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, also recently held provincial radio conferences, requiring all localities to seize the opportunity, concentrate their efforts to strengthen the management of autumn fields and cotton fields, and do everything possible to strive for a bumper harvest in autumn agriculture. In particular, all localities are required to do a good job in cultivation and weeding, accumulate more fertilizer and apply more fertilizer, prevent waterlogging and drought, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests during the two key months of July and August. The Kaifeng area of Henan Province also organized a meeting of cadres at five levels—prefecture, county, commune, team, and group—in the fields for inspection and comparison. The Party committee secretaries of many counties and people's communes in Leshan, Fuling, and Nanchong Special Zones of Sichuan Province have personally gone deep into the fields to grasp management work, leading the masses to analyze the causes of lodging in mid-season rice, summarize past experience in preventing lodging, mobilize the masses to offer suggestions and advice, and formulate measures to prevent rice lodging.

Field management work centered on summer hoeing is being vigorously carried out in various places. In Hebei Province, a total of more than 3.97 million people have participated in field management. More than 73 million mu of autumn grain and oil crops in the province have generally undergone one cultivation, half of which have been cultivated twice. High-yield fields have been cultivated three to four times, and some crops have also been topdressed and watered. By the beginning of July, Shandong Province had hoeed more than 64 million mu of grain and oil crops, eliminated weed infestations on more than 10.88 million mu, and topdressed more than 10 million mu. In Penglai County, out of 320,000 mu of peanuts in the county, more than 190,000 mu had been hoeed twice and earthed up once by July 2, and 110,000 mu had been topdressed with fertilizer. At the same time, most of the peanuts were pruned to prevent excessive growth. At present, the peanut seedlings are uniform and vigorous, and have begun to flower and set pods. More than 44 million mu of early autumn crops in Henan Province have generally been hoeed once, and 70% of the more than 64 million mu of late autumn crops have been cultivated. The Kaifeng area launched a week-long campaign to eliminate weeds. The entire area mobilized more than 50,000 cadres and more than 2.3 million laborers, and after five days of intensive work, weeds have been eliminated in more than 2.8 million mu of land. On July 1, the thirteen people's communes in Yancheng County mobilized more than 150,000 people to accumulate 1.5 million jin of various fertilizers, topdressed more than 15,000 mu of early and late autumn crops, and hoeed and weeded more than 9,800 mu of land. In Tongdao Dong Autonomous County, Hunan Province, after strengthening field management, all 410,000 mu of mid-season rice have undergone general cultivation and topdressing once, and some fields have undergone a second cultivation and topdressing. Third-class seedlings have decreased from the original 18% of the total area to 7%. Heilongjiang Province mobilized 3 million people to vigorously grasp field management. As of the 5th, the first hoeing has been completed, more than 70% has been hoeed a second time, and more than 50 million mu have been cultivated a second time. (Attached pictures)

    各地在秋田管理的关键月积极加强秋田管理
    抓中耕锄草　抓造肥追肥
    新华社18日讯　各地突击夏种的工作基本结束，已把主要力量转向对秋熟粮食作物、油料作物和棉花的中耕除草、追肥等秋田管理，决心抓好7、8、9三个月秋田的管理工作，力争秋季农业大丰收。
    7月以来，华北和东北各地雨量逐渐增多，部分地区的旱象已解除或缓和。各地禾苗长势旺盛，茎叶粗壮，一片碧绿。但同时杂草也生长极快，极易发生草荒，中耕除草等工作到了最紧张的时候。
    不少地区的党委早已加强了田间管理工作的领导。中共黑龙江省委在7月初曾召开地、市、县委书记的电话会议，要求各地狠抓田间管理工作，集中力量突击铲趟，做到细铲深趟，防止草荒，并号召开展三类苗升级运动。中共陕西省委和省人民委员会以及中共河南省委和省人民委员会也在最近分别举行了全省广播大会，要求各地抓紧时机，集中力量加强秋田和棉田管理，千方百计争取秋季农业大丰收，特别要求各地在7月、8月的两个关键月内，做好中耕除草、多积肥多施肥、防涝防旱、防治病虫害工作。河南省的开封地区还组织了地、县、社、队、组五级干部会师田间，进行检查评比。四川省乐山、涪陵、南充专区许多县和人民公社的党委书记，都已亲自深入田间抓管理工作，领导群众分析中稻倒伏原因，总结过去防倒伏经验，发动群众献计献策，制定防水稻倒伏的措施。
    以夏锄为中心的田间管理工作正在各地蓬勃开展。河北省参加田间管理的劳动力共达三百九十七万多人。全省已有七千三百多万亩大秋粮食作物和油料作物普遍进行了一次中耕，其中中耕两次的有一半左右，丰产田已经中耕了三次到四次，有一部分作物还进行了追肥和浇水。山东省到7月初就已锄完六千四百多万亩粮食作物和油料作物地，消灭草荒一千零八十八万多亩，追肥一千多万亩。蓬莱县全县三十二万亩花生到7月2日已有十九万多亩锄过两遍，培过一次土，有十一万亩追施了肥料，同时大部分花生打了主茎，防止疯长；目前花生苗齐苗旺，已开花下锥。河南省四千四百多万亩早秋作物已普遍锄过一遍，六千四百多万亩晚秋作物已有70％进行了中耕。开封地区开展了突击除草运动周，全区共出动五万多名干部、二百三十多万劳力，经过五天突击，已在二百八十多万亩地里消灭了杂草。郾城县十三个人民公社在7月1日出动十五万多人积造各种肥料一百五十万斤，早、晚秋作物追肥一万五千多亩，锄地拔草九千八百多亩。湖南省通道侗族自治县四十一万亩中稻，经过加强田间管理，普遍中耕、追肥一次，部分田已进行了第二次中耕、追肥；三类苗由原来占总面积的18％下降到7％。黑龙江省出动三百万人狠抓田间管理，到5日止头遍地已铲完，二遍铲了70％以上，趟出二遍的有五千多万亩。（附图片）
