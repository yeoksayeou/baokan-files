Model Cadre Rouzi Tuerdi

Rouzi Tuerdi, the director of the Wuxing People's Commune in Turpan County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is an outstanding Communist Party member. He is loyal to the Party, works hard, lives plainly, and loves labor. Because he leads by example, driving commune members to cultivate diligently, cotton production has increased from an average of 300 jin per mu to more than 500 jin. He himself has been named a model worker five times, and in 1956, he was honorably elected as an alternate representative to the Eighth National Congress of the Party. (Attached pictures)

    模范干部肉孜·吐尔的
    新疆维吾尔自治区吐鲁番县五星人民公社社主任肉孜·吐尔的，是优秀的共产党员。他对党忠诚、艰苦朴素，热爱劳动。由于他以身作则，带动社员勤耕细作，使棉花由平均亩产三百斤增加到五百多斤。他本人曾五次被评为劳动模范，并且在1956年，光荣地被选举为党的第八次全国代表大会候补代表。（附图片）
