    Learning from Zhao Xianzhang
    After reading the People's Daily report on June 20th about Zhao Xianzhang's down-to-earth work style, I was deeply moved.
    It just so happened that we were launching a production increase and savings campaign centered on accumulating fertilizer. After breakfast on the first day, the squad leaders reported figures to the brigade headquarters. One squad leader kept saying that his nine people had accumulated 80,000 jin of fertilizer, and they wanted to send a congratulatory message to the Party committee. At that time, our squad of five had only accumulated 6,000 jin, which was far behind them. At the time, I felt embarrassed, so I overstated our amount by 2,000 jin. Afterward, although I felt like I had gotten by, I was still uneasy and felt like I had done something wrong.
    At this time, I read the report about Zhao Xianzhang's excellent character, and I felt very uncomfortable. When reporting the figures, I knew that the other squad actually only had 20,000 jin, but why didn't I expose it at the time, and instead followed suit with a false report? Was this the attitude towards the leadership?
    Zhao Xianzhang's deeds have deeply educated me. In addition to declaring a correction to the brigade headquarters, I guarantee that I will study Zhao Xianzhang's down-to-earth style well in the future, not seek false fame, and report truthfully.

    学习赵宪章
    读了六月二十日人民日报关于赵宪章实事求是的作风报道后，深受感动。
    刚好那时，我们这里正开展以积肥为中心的增产节约运动。第一天早饭后，各小队长向大队部汇报数字，有一个小队长口口声声说他们九个人积了八万斤肥，并且要向党委送喜报。当时，我们这个小队五个人却只积了六千斤，和他们比起来差得太远了。当时，我觉得在面子上不好看，便多报了两千斤。过后，我虽然觉得是过了关，但内心却忐忑跳动，觉得自己做了亏心事。
    在这个时候，我读到了关于赵宪章优秀品德的报道，心里很难受。在汇报数字的时候，我明知那个小队实际上只有两万斤，但是当时为什么不说破，反而跟着虚报呢？这难道是对待领导的态度么？
    赵宪章的事迹深深教育了我，我除了向大队部声明纠正外，保证今后一定要好好学习赵宪章的实事求是的作风，不图虚名，如实汇报。
