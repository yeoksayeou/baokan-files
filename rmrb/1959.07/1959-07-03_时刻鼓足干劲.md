　　Revolutionary drive must be maintained at all times. It is certainly needed when conditions are unfavorable, but it is equally needed when conditions are good. If we slacken our efforts, we will not achieve the victories we deserve.

　　With drive, we can have a strong revolutionary will, think of ways from a positive perspective, create conditions, and achieve victory. In this sense, drive is an important condition for doing everything well.

　　In 1958, we were full of drive, and there was a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. In the first half of this year, we continued to summon up drive, and production continued to leap forward. Now that the third quarter has begun, we must continue to move forward with vigorous revolutionary drive and turn the third quarter into a decisive quarter for increasing production and practicing economy.

    时刻鼓足干劲
    革命干劲，任何时候都必须保持，条件不好的时候，固然需要干劲十足，条件好的时候，同样需要干劲，如果松了劲，也会得不到应有的胜利成果。
    有了干劲，才能有革命的坚强意志，才能从积极方面想办法，创造条件，取得胜利。从这个意义上说，干劲是做好一切事情的重要条件。
    1958年，我们干劲十足，工农业生产大跃进了。今年上半年，我们继续鼓足干劲，生产继续跃进了。现在，第三季度已经开始，我们仍要鼓足旺盛的革命干劲继续前进，把第三季度变为增产节约的决胜季度。
