Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 20th: The Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, lasting twenty days, concluded victoriously on the afternoon of the 17th. The meeting passed a resolution on carrying out democratic reform in the entire Tibet region. When this resolution of great historical significance in Tibet was passed, the venue erupted in thunderous applause.

This meeting opened on June 28th, and the spirit of democracy, consultation, and unity was fully implemented throughout the entire process. The resolution on carrying out democratic reform in Tibet marks the eternal liberation of the Tibetan working people from the dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system, and their entry into a new era of being masters of their own destiny.

The closing meeting was presided over by Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni.

Zhang Jingwu, representative from the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and Deputy Head of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, both attended the closing meeting.

Panchen Erdeni delivered a closing speech, saying that this meeting was a historically significant one for carrying out democratic reform in Tibet. The committee members and representatives attending the meeting, including representatives of the working people, gathered together, conducted full discussions and repeated consultations, reached a consensus on all policy principles, and expressed their complete support. All matters decided in the resolution are entirely in line with the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the Tibetan people.

Panchen Erdeni pointed out that realizing the democratic reform that the Tibetan people have long yearned for is necessary, timely, and possible. He expressed the hope that everyone, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, on the basis of patriotism, unity, and progress, will stand firm on their political positions, fully mobilize the masses, and extensively carry out the democratic reform movement, in order to fully implement the resolutions of the meeting, smash the feudal serf system that has been shackled around the necks of the Tibetan people for thousands of years, and thoroughly realize democratic reform.

Before Panchen Erdeni delivered his closing speech, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme read out the draft resolution formulated after full discussion by the committee members. Then, a vote was held, and all the committee members present unanimously passed it. At this time, more than 600 representatives of people from all walks of life, both monks and laypeople, in Tibet, attending the meeting as non-voting delegates, warmly applauded to express their congratulations, and the entire venue was filled with jubilation.

The "Resolution on Carrying Out Democratic Reform" pointed out that only by realizing democratic reform in Tibet can the Tibetan people be liberated, Tibet's economy and culture be developed, and a foundation be laid for building a prosperous and happy socialist Tibet.

The resolution stated: With the rapid suppression of the rebellion, the Tibetan reactionary clique suffered a shameful defeat, prompting the Tibetan situation to enter a new stage of democratic reform, and the conditions for realizing democratic reform have matured.

The resolution believes that the central government's policy of peaceful reform for carrying out democratic reform in Tibet is completely correct. According to the actual situation in the Tibetan region, the realization of democratic reform should be divided into two steps. The first step is to fully mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out the movement against rebellion, against the Ula corv√©e system, against slavery, and for rent reduction and interest reduction, in order to lay the foundation for land distribution in the next step.

In order to complete the task of democratic reform, the resolution set out various policies that must be implemented.

The resolution also emphasized that fully mobilizing the masses is the key to realizing the "Three Antis" and "Two Reductions" and democratic reform. In the process of work, it is necessary to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, consolidate unity with the middle peasants, and unite all who can be united.

The resolution stated that documents such as the regulations on the organization of peasant (herdsman) associations, the simple regulations on rent reduction and interest reduction, and the plan for adjusting administrative divisions will be promulgated separately by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

The resolution concluded by pointing out: The task before us is great and arduous. The Tibetan monks and laypeople must unite as one under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, work hard, and strive to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

Also attending the closing meeting were responsible cadres from various departments of the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the Tibet Military Region, as well as representatives from various people's organizations, all walks of life, religious circles, and working people from all trades and industries in Tibet.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 20th: Panchen Erdeni, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, spoke at the closing meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region on the 17th.

Panchen Erdeni first pointed out in his speech: This Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is a historically significant meeting at the time of carrying out democratic reform in Tibet. He said that at this meeting, Vice Chairman Zhang Guohua, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Deputy Head of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Wang Feng, and himself had made reports on the guiding principles and policies for carrying out democratic reform in Tibet. The participating committee members and cadres, cadres of the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, officers and soldiers of the Tibet Military Region, representatives of various nationalities, various religious sects, mass organizations in Lhasa, and the working people, gathered together, conducted full discussions, repeated consultations, reached a consensus on all policy principles, and expressed their complete support. During the discussion process, frank opinions were heard from the committee members and representatives, and beneficial opinions were absorbed and resolutions were passed. He said that all matters decided in the resolution are completely in line with the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the Tibetan people. This meeting successfully completed its great and glorious task.

Panchen Erdeni said that realizing the democratic reform that the Tibetan people have long yearned for is necessary, timely, and possible. Everyone must, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, on the basis of patriotism, unity, and progress, stand firm on their political positions, fully mobilize the masses, and extensively carry out the democratic reform movement, in order to thoroughly smash the feudal serf system that has been shackled around the necks of the Tibetan people for thousands of years, and thoroughly realize democratic reform.

When Panchen Erdeni talked about protecting freedom of religious belief and other issues, he emphatically pointed out: Continuing to protect freedom of religious belief and protecting patriotic and law-abiding temples and historical relics is a firm and unwavering policy. Therefore, after democratic reform, abolishing the exploitation system and privileges of temples is fundamentally different in nature from protecting freedom of religious belief. He said that the doctrines of religion seek peace in the present and future and engage in altruistic undertakings. Carrying out democratic reform is the only way to develop Tibet's economy and culture and to make the people happy and free. Therefore, patriotic and law-abiding religious figures should deeply recognize that the various forms of exploitation and privileges formed within religion that have been stained by the egregious feudal serf system must be abolished. Only in this way can it be beneficial to religion and beneficial to the people. Then, actively supporting democratic reform becomes the primary task of religious figures.

Panchen Erdeni said that for the various good undertakings of the Tibetan people on the road to a happy and fulfilling socialist path, imperialists and reactionaries will do everything possible to sabotage them, and we must be vigilant about this.

Panchen Erdeni finally said that in order to ensure that the resolutions of the meeting are fully and thoroughly implemented, we must rely on all patriotic and progressive friends, comrades, and the entire working people to actively work hard together. He hoped that the representatives and comrades attending the meeting would widely and deeply publicize the spirit of the resolutions and policy reports of the meeting to the broad masses of the people, and fully rely on the masses to earnestly implement the various policies decided by this meeting, and work hard to complete the glorious task of democratic reform.
