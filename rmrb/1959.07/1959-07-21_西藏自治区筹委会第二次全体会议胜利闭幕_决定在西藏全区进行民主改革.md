Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 20th: The Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, lasting twenty days, concluded victoriously on the afternoon of the 17th. The meeting passed a resolution on carrying out democratic reform in the entire Tibet region. When this resolution of great historical significance in Tibet was passed, the venue erupted in thunderous applause.

This meeting opened on June 28th, and the spirit of democracy, consultation, and unity was fully implemented throughout the entire process. The resolution on carrying out democratic reform in Tibet marks the eternal liberation of the Tibetan working people from the dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system, and their entry into a new era of being masters of their own destiny.

The closing meeting was presided over by Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni.

Zhang Jingwu, representative from the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and Deputy Head of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, both attended the closing meeting.

Panchen Erdeni delivered a closing speech, saying that this meeting was a historically significant one for carrying out democratic reform in Tibet. The committee members and representatives attending the meeting, including representatives of the working people, gathered together, conducted full discussions and repeated consultations, reached a consensus on all policy principles, and expressed their complete support. All matters decided in the resolution are entirely in line with the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the Tibetan people.

Panchen Erdeni pointed out that realizing the democratic reform that the Tibetan people have long yearned for is necessary, timely, and possible. He expressed the hope that everyone, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, on the basis of patriotism, unity, and progress, will stand firm on their political positions, fully mobilize the masses, and extensively carry out the democratic reform movement, in order to fully implement the resolutions of the meeting, smash the feudal serf system that has been shackled around the necks of the Tibetan people for thousands of years, and thoroughly realize democratic reform.

Before Panchen Erdeni delivered his closing speech, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme read out the draft resolution formulated after full discussion by the committee members. Then, a vote was held, and all the committee members present unanimously passed it. At this time, more than 600 representatives of people from all walks of life, both monks and laypeople, in Tibet, attending the meeting as non-voting delegates, warmly applauded to express their congratulations, and the entire venue was filled with jubilation.

The "Resolution on Carrying Out Democratic Reform" pointed out that only by realizing democratic reform in Tibet can the Tibetan people be liberated, Tibet's economy and culture be developed, and a foundation be laid for building a prosperous and happy socialist Tibet.

The resolution stated: With the rapid suppression of the rebellion, the Tibetan reactionary clique suffered a shameful defeat, prompting the Tibetan situation to enter a new stage of democratic reform, and the conditions for realizing democratic reform have matured.

The resolution believes that the central government's policy of peaceful reform for carrying out democratic reform in Tibet is completely correct. According to the actual situation in the Tibetan region, the realization of democratic reform should be divided into two steps. The first step is to fully mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out the movement against rebellion, against the Ula corvée system, against slavery, and for rent reduction and interest reduction, in order to lay the foundation for land distribution in the next step.

In order to complete the task of democratic reform, the resolution set out various policies that must be implemented.

The resolution also emphasized that fully mobilizing the masses is the key to realizing the "Three Antis" and "Two Reductions" and democratic reform. In the process of work, it is necessary to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, consolidate unity with the middle peasants, and unite all who can be united.

The resolution stated that documents such as the regulations on the organization of peasant (herdsman) associations, the simple regulations on rent reduction and interest reduction, and the plan for adjusting administrative divisions will be promulgated separately by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

The resolution concluded by pointing out: The task before us is great and arduous. The Tibetan monks and laypeople must unite as one under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, work hard, and strive to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

Also attending the closing meeting were responsible cadres from various departments of the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the Tibet Military Region, as well as representatives from various people's organizations, all walks of life, religious circles, and working people from all trades and industries in Tibet.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 20th: Panchen Erdeni, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, spoke at the closing meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region on the 17th.

Panchen Erdeni first pointed out in his speech: This Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is a historically significant meeting at the time of carrying out democratic reform in Tibet. He said that at this meeting, Vice Chairman Zhang Guohua, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Deputy Head of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Wang Feng, and himself had made reports on the guiding principles and policies for carrying out democratic reform in Tibet. The participating committee members and cadres, cadres of the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, officers and soldiers of the Tibet Military Region, representatives of various nationalities, various religious sects, mass organizations in Lhasa, and the working people, gathered together, conducted full discussions, repeated consultations, reached a consensus on all policy principles, and expressed their complete support. During the discussion process, frank opinions were heard from the committee members and representatives, and beneficial opinions were absorbed and resolutions were passed. He said that all matters decided in the resolution are completely in line with the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the Tibetan people. This meeting successfully completed its great and glorious task.

Panchen Erdeni said that realizing the democratic reform that the Tibetan people have long yearned for is necessary, timely, and possible. Everyone must, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, on the basis of patriotism, unity, and progress, stand firm on their political positions, fully mobilize the masses, and extensively carry out the democratic reform movement, in order to thoroughly smash the feudal serf system that has been shackled around the necks of the Tibetan people for thousands of years, and thoroughly realize democratic reform.

When Panchen Erdeni talked about protecting freedom of religious belief and other issues, he emphatically pointed out: Continuing to protect freedom of religious belief and protecting patriotic and law-abiding temples and historical relics is a firm and unwavering policy. Therefore, after democratic reform, abolishing the exploitation system and privileges of temples is fundamentally different in nature from protecting freedom of religious belief. He said that the doctrines of religion seek peace in the present and future and engage in altruistic undertakings. Carrying out democratic reform is the only way to develop Tibet's economy and culture and to make the people happy and free. Therefore, patriotic and law-abiding religious figures should deeply recognize that the various forms of exploitation and privileges formed within religion that have been stained by the egregious feudal serf system must be abolished. Only in this way can it be beneficial to religion and beneficial to the people. Then, actively supporting democratic reform becomes the primary task of religious figures.

Panchen Erdeni said that for the various good undertakings of the Tibetan people on the road to a happy and fulfilling socialist path, imperialists and reactionaries will do everything possible to sabotage them, and we must be vigilant about this.

Panchen Erdeni finally said that in order to ensure that the resolutions of the meeting are fully and thoroughly implemented, we must rely on all patriotic and progressive friends, comrades, and the entire working people to actively work hard together. He hoped that the representatives and comrades attending the meeting would widely and deeply publicize the spirit of the resolutions and policy reports of the meeting to the broad masses of the people, and fully rely on the masses to earnestly implement the various policies decided by this meeting, and work hard to complete the glorious task of democratic reform.

    西藏自治区筹委会第二次全体会议胜利闭幕
    决定在西藏全区进行民主改革
    班禅额尔德尼在讲话中指出：会议经过充分讨论，对民主改革所有政策原则问题取得一致认识。他希望大家圆满贯彻会议决议，彻底粉碎千百年来套在西藏人民脖子上的封建农奴制度
    新华社拉萨20日电　历时二十天的西藏自治区筹备委员会第二次全体委员会议，在17日下午闭幕。会议通过了关于在西藏全区进行民主改革的决议。当这个在西藏有重大历史意义的决议通过的时候，会场爆发出春雷般的掌声。
    这次会议是在6月28日开幕的，会议自始至终充分贯彻了民主、协商、团结的精神。关于在西藏进行民主改革的决议，标志着西藏劳动人民永远摆脱黑暗的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度，进入人民当家作主的新时代。
    闭幕会议由代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼主持。
    中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武和民族事务委员会副主任、中共中央统一战线工作部副部长汪锋都参加了闭幕会议。
    班禅额尔德尼致闭幕词说，这次会议是在西藏进行民主改革的具有历史意义的一次会议。出席这次会议的委员和列席代表，包括劳动人民的代表，欢聚一堂，进行了充分的讨论、反复的协商，对所有的政策原则问题，取得了一致的认识，并表示完全拥护。在决议中决定的所有事项，是完全符合西藏广大人民的根本利益的。
    班禅额尔德尼指出，实现西藏人民长久向往的民主改革，是必要的，适时的，也是可能的。他希望大家在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，在爱国、团结、进步的基础上，站稳政治立场，充分发动群众，广泛开展民主改革运动，为圆满地贯彻会议的决议，粉碎千百年来套在西藏人民脖子上的封建农奴制度，彻底实现民主改革而斗争。
    班禅额尔德尼致闭幕词以前，由阿沛·阿旺晋美副主任委员兼秘书长宣读了经过委员们充分讨论而拟订的决议草案。接着举行表决，到会的全体委员一致通过。这时，列席的六百多位西藏各阶层僧俗人民的代表热烈鼓掌表示祝贺，整个会场一片欢腾。
      “关于进行民主改革的决议”指出，在西藏只有实现民主改革，才能解放西藏人民，发展西藏的经济和文化，为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义的西藏奠定基础。
    决议说：随着叛乱的迅速平定，西藏反动集团遭到可耻的失败，促使西藏形势进入了一个民主改革的新阶段，实现民主改革的条件已经成熟。
    决议认为中央对西藏进行民主改革采取和平改革的方针是完全正确的。根据西藏地区的实际情况，实现民主改革应当分为两步走。首先是充分发动群众，大力开展反对叛乱、反对乌拉差役制度、反对奴役和减租减息的运动，为下一步分配土地打下基础。
    为了完成民主改革的任务，决议订出了必须贯彻执行的各项政策。
    决议还强调指出，充分发动群众是实现“三反”“双减”和民主改革的关键，在工作过程中必须依靠贫雇农、巩固地团结中农和团结一切可以团结的人。
    决议说，关于制定农（牧）民协会组织章程、减租减息简则以及行政区划调整方案等文件，将由西藏自治区筹委会另行公布。
    决议最后指出：摆在我们面前的任务是伟大的、艰巨的。西藏僧俗人民必须在中国共产党的领导下，团结一致，努力工作，为建设民主的和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。
    参加闭幕会议的，还有中共西藏工委、西藏自治区筹委会和西藏军区各部门的负责干部，以及西藏各人民团体、各阶层、宗教界和各行各业劳动人民的代表。
    新华社拉萨20日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼17日在西藏自治区筹备委员会第二次全体委员会议闭幕会上讲了话。
    班禅额尔德尼在讲话中首先指出：这次西藏自治区筹备委员会的第二次全体委员会议，是在西藏进行民主改革的时候具有历史意义的一次会议。他说，在这次会议上，张国华副主任委员、阿沛·阿旺晋美副主任委员兼秘书长、中共中央统一战线工作部副部长汪锋和我，曾就在西藏进行民主改革的方针政策等问题作了报告。与会的筹委会委员和干部、中共西藏工委的干部，西藏军区的官兵、各民族、各教派、拉萨市的群众团体以及劳动人民的代表们，欢聚一堂，进行了充分的讨论，反复的协商，对所有的政策原则问题，取得了一致的认识，并表示完全拥护。在讨论过程中，听取了委员们、代表们直率的意见，并吸取了有益的意见而通过了决议。他说，决议中决定的所有事项，是完全符合西藏广大人民的根本利益的。这次会议顺利地完成了伟大而光荣的任务。
    班禅额尔德尼说，实现西藏人民长久向往的民主改革，是必要的、适时的，也是可能的。大家必须在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，在爱国、团结、进步的基础上，站稳政治立场，充分发动群众，广泛开展民主改革运动，为彻底粉碎千百年来套在西藏人民脖子上的封建农奴制度，彻底实现民主改革而坚决斗争。
    班禅额尔德尼谈到保护宗教信仰自由等问题时着重指出：继续保护宗教信仰自由，保护爱国守法的寺庙和有历史意义的文物古迹，是一项坚定不移的政策。因此，经过民主改革，废除寺庙的剥削制度和特权，同保护宗教信仰自由是性质根本不同的两件事。他说，宗教的教义是在目前和将来寻求和平，从事利他事业。进行民主改革，是发展西藏的经济、文化，使人民得到幸福自由的唯一道路。因此，爱国守法的宗教界人士，应该深刻认识到宗教内部被恶劣的封建农奴制度所沾污而形成的各种剥削和特权必须废除。只有这样，才能够对宗教有利、对人民有利。那么，积极拥护民主改革，就成为宗教界人士首要的任务了。
    班禅额尔德尼说，对于西藏人民走上幸福圆满的社会主义大道的各项良好事业，帝国主义和反动派们总会千方百计地进行破坏，对此我们必须提高警惕。
    班禅额尔德尼最后说，要使会议的决议圆满彻底地贯彻下去，就必须依靠所有爱国进步的朋友们，同志们，和全体劳动人民一道积极努力。希望参加会议的代表们和同志们把会议的决议及各项政策报告的精神，向广大人民进行广泛深入的宣传，并充分依靠群众，切实贯彻执行这次会议所决定的各项政策，为完成民主改革的光荣任务而努力工作。（附图片）
