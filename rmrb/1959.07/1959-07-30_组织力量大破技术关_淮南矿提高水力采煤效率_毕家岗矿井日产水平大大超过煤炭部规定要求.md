Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 29th July: Huainan Coal Mine has made great breakthroughs in hydraulic mining technology, and coal production has been increasing month by month. The second quarter of this year saw a production increase of over 47% compared to the first quarter. In the first and middle ten days of July, the average daily output increased by more than 300 tons compared to the same period in June. Among them, the Bijagang hydraulic mining pit achieved an average daily output of 1,015 tons in June, and a maximum daily output of 1,680 tons, both greatly exceeding the Ministry of Coal Industry's requirement that the daily output of hydraulic mining pits should not be less than 150 tons.

Hydraulic mining is highly efficient, consumes less timber, has lower costs, and is safer for production. In the first half of the year, the efficiency of hydraulic mining areas in Huainan Coal Mine averaged 10.563 tons, equivalent to one and a half times the efficiency of general dry mining. The consumption of timber per thousand tons was only 3.11 cubic meters, while general dry mining consumes 19.23 cubic meters per thousand tons. Due to high efficiency and low timber consumption, the production cost per ton of coal can be reduced by more than half compared to dry mining. Hydraulic mining also reduces the physical labor of workers.

Huainan Coal Mine began using hydraulic mining in July last year, and now has three hydraulic mining pits and three hydraulic mining areas. After the promotion of hydraulic mining, due to a lack of experience, many technical difficulties were encountered, and production in various mines experienced intermittent periods of interruption. In response to this situation, the Mining Bureau and various mines have transferred a group of technical personnel, along with some veteran workers and cadres, to form a hydraulic mining technology research group, responsible for solving various technical problems in hydraulic mining.

Hydraulic mining has a complex set of transportation equipment: high-pressure water pumps force water from the ground into the mine, and the mined coal flows with the water into the underground coal-water sump. Then the coal-water is pumped to the surface through coal-water pumps, and then the coal and water are separated through dehydration. In the process of promoting hydraulic mining, the main problems encountered by Huainan Coal Mine were frequent accidents with various transportation machinery and equipment, and blockages in coal-water pipelines and coal-water pumps, which seriously affected normal operation. To change this situation, they first modified the structure of the coal-water pumps, changing the original round ball disc to a conical ball disc, to avoid the phenomenon of coal-water seeping into the bearings, washing away the lubricating oil, causing the ball disc to rub, heat up, and burn out, ensuring the normal operation of the coal-water pumps. At the same time, they studied the addition of scraper conveyors to select large pieces of coal, wooden wedges, and bark, so that large pieces of coal can be crushed and processed before entering the coal-water sump, avoiding the phenomenon of large pieces of coal and wooden wedges filling the coal-water pumps.

Strengthening production management and the maintenance and repair of mechanical equipment is also an important experience for Huainan Coal Mine in achieving normal production in hydraulic mining pits. They have strengthened the scheduling work of various hydraulic mining pits and hydraulic mining areas, aiming at the characteristics of hydraulic mining, which has many mechanical equipment and each link is closely linked to the next, to ensure the coordinated action of each link.

In order to ensure the normal progress of hydraulic mining, Huainan Coal Mine also adopted various methods to improve the operating technical level of hydraulic mining workers, so that the coal recovery rate increased from the original 70% to 80%-85%. Originally, it took five people one and a half hours to move a water gun once; with the improvement of operating skills, it now only takes three people half an hour. Due to the shortening of the gun moving time, the coal mining time is also correspondingly extended.

    组织力量大破技术关
    淮南矿提高水力采煤效率
    毕家岗矿井日产水平大大超过煤炭部规定要求
    新华社合肥29日电　淮南煤矿大破水力采煤技术关，煤炭产量逐月提高。今年第二季度同第一季度比较，水力采煤的产量增长了47％以上；7月上、中旬同6月同期比较，平均日产量又增加三百多吨。其中，毕家岗水采矿井6月份的平均日产量达到一千零一十五吨，最高的日产量达到了一千六百八十吨，都大大超过了煤炭工业部规定的水采矿井日产不低于一百五十吨的要求。
    水力采煤效率高，坑木消耗少，成本低，生产安全。淮南煤矿水力采煤的采区效率上半年平均达到了十点五六三吨，相当于一般旱采效率的一倍半；坑木的千吨耗只需要三点一一立方米，一般旱采千吨耗是十九点二三立方米。由于效率高、坑木消耗少，每吨煤的生产成本比旱采能降低一半以上。水力采煤还减轻了工人的体力劳动。
    淮南煤矿从去年7月份开始用水力采煤，现在有三个水采矿井和三个水采区。推广水力采煤以后，由于缺乏经验，技术上遇到很多困难，各矿井生产上曾经发生过时断时续的状态。针对这种情况，矿务局和各矿都抽调了一批技术力量，加上一些老工人和干部，共同组成了水力采煤技术研究组，专门负责解决水力采煤中的各种技术问题。
    水力采煤有一套复杂的运输设备：高压水泵把地面的水压入井下，采下来的煤随着水一道流入井下煤水仓，然后经过煤水泵把煤水排到地面上来，再经过脱水把煤和水分开。淮南煤矿在推行水力采煤中，遇到的主要问题是各种运输机械设备事故多，煤水管路和煤水泵堵塞等，严重地影响了正常运转。为改变这种情况，他们首先对煤水泵的结构作了修改，把原来的圆形弹子盘改为锥形弹子盘，避免了因煤水窜进轴承冲走润滑油引起弹子盘磨擦发热和烧坏的现象，保证了煤水泵的正常运转；同时，研究增设了刮板机，把大块煤、木楔和板皮等选出，使大块煤经过破碎加工后再进入煤水仓，避免了大块煤和木楔等填塞煤水泵的现象。
    加强生产管理和机械设备维护检修，也是淮南煤矿达到水采矿井正常生产的重要经验。他们曾针对水力采煤机械设备多，而且一环紧扣着一环的特点，加强了各水采矿井和水采区的调度工作，保证了各个环节的协同动作。
    为了保证水力采煤的正常进行，淮南煤矿还采取各种方式提高水采工的操作技术水平，使煤的回收率由原来70％提高到80％—85％。原来水枪手移一次水枪需要五个人工作一个半小时；随着操作技术的熟练，现在只要三个人、工作半小时。由于移枪时间的缩短，也相应地延长了采煤的时间。
