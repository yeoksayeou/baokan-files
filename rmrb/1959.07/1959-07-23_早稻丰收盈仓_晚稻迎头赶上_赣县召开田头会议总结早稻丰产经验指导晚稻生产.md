Early Rice Harvest Overflows Granaries, Late Rice Catches Up
Ganxian County Holds Field Meetings to Summarize Early Rice High-Yield Experiences and Guide Late Rice Production

(Our newspaper's Ganzhou dispatch, 22nd) Ganxian County, Jiangxi Province, people's communes and production teams are extensively holding field meetings, organizing commune members and cadres to summarize early rice high-yield experiences on the battlefield, finding more and better ways to strive for a bumper late rice harvest, and providing timely guidance for summer planting.

Ganxian County's over 300,000 mu of early rice is expected to yield a bumper harvest. Each commune plans to plant 270,000 mu of late rice (in addition to planning to plant 110,000 mu of sweet potatoes and 30,000 mu of late soybeans). The task of rushing to harvest early rice and rush-planting late rice is heavy and time is pressing. The entire county must complete the summer harvest and summer planting within half a month to twenty days. How to mobilize the masses to summarize early rice yield-increasing experiences and provide timely guidance for summer planting has become an important issue that urgently needs to be resolved. According to the county party committee's instructions, each commune organized commune members to hold meetings in the fields during work breaks. Those attending the meetings included commune members and cadres with different opinions. At the meeting, everyone spoke based on the actual yield of each field after harvesting, combined with the cultivation process, and after debate, they finally summarized a complete set of early rice yield-increasing experiences. Based on the early rice high-yield experiences, they formulated or supplemented late rice yield-increasing measures, which everyone uniformly implemented.

In previous years, Ganxian County was busy with rush harvesting and rush planting, and often summarized early rice yield-increasing experiences after the end of summer harvesting and summer planting, making it difficult to use them to guide late rice production. This year, because each commune and production team used work breaks to hold field meetings, they organized commune members to summarize early rice yield-increasing experiences during the very busy rush harvest. Therefore, they found more and better measures and methods for increasing late rice production and provided timely guidance for summer planting. While rushing to harvest early rice, the Jibu Production Brigade of Shashi Commune held field meetings in each of its thirteen teams. More than 10,000 commune members and cadres participated in the field meetings, forming a nationwide upsurge of summarizing early rice high-yield experiences. At the field meetings, everyone debated enthusiastically. Some commune members, in order to prove that appropriate close planting could increase production, brought four or five types of rice seedling samples with different planting densities for everyone to examine. Some commune members, in order to illustrate the importance of rational fertilization, brought rice seedlings with varying degrees of tillering and lodging caused by different fertilization methods for everyone to study and analyze. After debate, based on a unified understanding, the commune members of the Jibu Brigade unanimously believed that the main experiences for increasing early rice production this year were: early season, deep plowing to improve the soil, sufficient base fertilizer, rational top dressing, appropriate close planting, and strengthening field management. According to these experiences, and based on the growth characteristics of late rice, the commune members added five major measures for a bumper late rice harvest. Now all the commune members of the brigade are conscientiously implementing these measures, and all of the more than 1,300 mu of late rice fields have been plowed and harrowed four times and have been applied with 50 dan of base fertilizer. It is estimated that late rice seedlings can be fully transplanted before the 25th of this month, which will be one season earlier than last year.

    早稻丰收盈仓　晚稻迎头赶上
    赣县召开田头会议总结早稻丰产经验指导晚稻生产
    本报赣州22日电　江西赣县各个人民公社、生产队广泛召开田头会议，组织社员、干部在战地总结早稻丰产经验，为争取晚稻大丰收找到更多更好的办法，及时指导了夏种。
    赣县三十多万亩早稻可获得大丰收。各公社计划种二十七万亩晚稻（另外还计划种十一万亩番薯，三万亩晚大豆）。抢收早稻、抢种晚稻的任务繁重，时间紧迫，全县必须在半月至二十天之内结束夏收夏种。怎样发动群众总结早稻增产经验及时指导夏种？就成为一个急需解决的重要问题。各公社根据县委的指示组织社员利用工余休息时间在田头开会，参加会议的包括各种不同意见的社员和干部。会上，就实论虚，各人根据在各丘田里收割的实际产量，结合耕作过程发表意见，经过争辩，最后总结出成套早稻增产经验，并根据早稻丰产经验制订或补充晚稻增产措施，大家统一执行。
    赣县往年因为抢收抢种繁忙，往往在结束夏收夏种之后总结早稻丰产经验，结果很难运用它去指导晚稻生产。今年各公社、生产队由于利用工余休息时间召开田头会议，在十分繁忙的抢收中组织社员总结了早稻增产经验，因而为晚稻增产找到了更多更好的措施和办法，及时指导了夏种。沙石公社吉埠生产大队一边抢收早稻，全大队的十三个小队都分别召开了田头会，参加田头会的达一万余名社员和干部，形成了全民总结早稻丰产经验的热潮。田头会上，大家热烈争论，有的社员为了证明适当密植能增产，搬来四、五种不同密植规格的禾苗标本，给大家考察；有的社员为了说明合理施肥的重要性，搬来施肥方法不同引起的分蘖、倒伏程度不一的禾苗给大家研究分析。经过争辩，在统一认识的基础上，吉埠大队社员们一致认为今年早稻增产的主要经验是：季节早、深翻改良土壤、底肥足、追肥合理、适当密植、加强田间管理等八项。依照这些经验，根据晚稻生长特点，社员们为晚稻丰收增订了五大措施。现在全大队社员正认真执行这些措施，对一千三百多亩晚稻田已全部进行了四次犁耙，施足了五十担基肥，预计在本月25日前可以全部插上晚稻秧苗，比去年将提前一个季节。
