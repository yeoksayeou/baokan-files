Applying the "Eight-Character Charter" to Achieve High Wheat Yields
Technical Experience Summary of Large-Scale High-Yield Wheat Production in Meng County, Henan

Abstract

Based on deep plowing, focusing on close planting, and with water and fertilizer as preconditions, fully implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is the key to achieving large-scale high wheat yields.

What determines wheat yield is the number of plants, number of ears, number of grains, and grain weight per unit area. Reasonably increasing the seeding rate can directly increase the number of plants and ears per unit area; maintaining a certain nutritional area for each plant can ensure large and numerous ears. However, excessively increasing the seeding rate not only increases dead plants and tillers, but also increases the proportion of small ears, and the number of grains per ear also decreases accordingly, resulting in reduced production.

Striving to apply wheat base fertilizer in late autumn and applying topdressing fertilizer as early as possible is a successful experience in this year's high wheat yield in Meng County. The earlier winter topdressing is applied, the more tillers the seedlings produce before the New Year, the better the root system develops, the stronger the growth, and the higher the yield; early spring topdressing can consolidate tillers before the New Year and increase the number of fertile spikelets, which is important for increasing yield. After close planting of wheat, the root system needs to extend and expand the area for absorbing nutrients even more. Deep plowing combined with fertilization can meet this requirement and further enhance the role of rational close planting.

Watering appropriately and in a timely manner, and maintaining soil moisture content between 16% and 20% can basically meet the needs of wheat at all growth stages.

The main causes of lodging are improper cultivation techniques, excessive or late fertilization, or excessive or frequent watering. This year, Meng County's main experience in preventing lodging is to apply fertilizer appropriately, control watering, select improved varieties, and sow at the right time.

Under the new situation of people's communes, the Meng County Party Committee of Henan Province, based on the summary of the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958, has planned to cultivate large-scale high-yield wheat fields. After eight months of hard work, a bumper harvest has now been generally achieved.

The wheat in Meng County's high-yield fields is plowed deeply, planted densely, and fertilized heavily, which is unprecedented in any previous year. There are experiences and lessons learned. A careful and systematic summary of these experiences and lessons is of great significance for further improving wheat cultivation technology and striving for even greater harvests in the future.

The high-yield fields all selected improved varieties such as Baiyupi, Bima No. 1, and Pingyuan 50; the land was generally plowed about one foot deep; sowing was done at the right time around the Cold Dew solar term, with a seeding rate of 30 jin per mu; 7,000 to 8,000 jin of fertilizer were applied; the fields were harrowed and hoed two to three times in winter and spring, and weeds were removed once or twice; and seed soaking, seed selection, soil disinfection, elimination of wheat midges, and smoke fumigation for frost prevention and other disaster prevention and yield protection measures were generally carried out.

The growth characteristics of wheat in high-yield fields are: (1) Many plants, large ears, many grains, plump grains, strong stems, and uniform growth. (2) Except for a few high-yield experimental fields, there was generally no lodging.

According to sampling surveys in the fields before harvest, there were generally about 350,000 to 450,000 ears per mu, with 20 to 25 grains per ear, and a thousand-grain weight of 33.1 grams (equivalent to 15,000 grains per jin), and less than 1% of the wheat fields were lodged.

Based on the above characteristics, the cultivation technology experience of high-yield fields can be summarized in the following five points:

Rational Close Planting

What determines wheat yield is the number of plants, number of ears, number of grains, and grain weight per unit area. The high-yield fields generally have a seeding rate of 30 jin per mu and a row spacing of 3.5 cun, which is an increase of 10 to 12 jin in seeding rate and a reduction of 1.5 cun to 3.5 cun in row spacing compared to last year. Increasing the seeding rate can directly increase the number of plants and ears per unit area, and narrowing the row spacing can make the wheat evenly distributed, maintain a certain nutritional area for individual plants, and ensure large and numerous ears. This is one of the important measures for high-yield fields to achieve large-scale balanced yield increases.

According to surveys in Chengguan, Chengbo, and other places, this year's high-yield fields have approximately 200,000 to 400,000 plants per mu, generally around 300,000 plants; there are 260,000 to 560,000 ears per mu, with most wheat fields having 350,000 to 450,000 ears, averaging around 400,000 ears. According to a survey of more than 600 mu of high-yield fields in four brigades of the Chengguan Commune: the average seeding rate for yields of 600 to 700 jin per mu was 41 jin, with 433,000 ears and 21.3 grains per ear; the average seeding rate for yields of 500 to 600 jin per mu was 35.1 jin, with 414,000 ears and 25.8 grains per ear; the average seeding rate for yields of 400 jin to 500 jin per mu was 33.9 jin, with 400,700 ears and 23.7 grains per ear. In general, under the existing farming level and yield range of 400 to 700 jin per mu in the local area, the higher the yield, the more the seeding rate, and the more the number of ears per mu, but the number of ears per mu is roughly around 400,000, with little difference. This is due to the influence of cultivation conditions such as water, fertilizer, soil, and seeds.

Another situation is that within the same yield range, the seeding rate varies greatly. For example, in wheat fields with 400 to 500 jin per mu, the highest seeding rate was 45 jin, generally around 30 jin, and the lowest was 18.8 jin; in wheat fields with 500 to 600 jin per mu, the highest seeding rate was 45 jin, generally 30 jin, and the lowest 25 jin; in wheat fields with 600 to 700 jin per mu, the highest was 60 jin, generally more than 30 jin, and the lowest 29 jin. From the above materials, it can be seen that regardless of whether the yield is 300, 400 jin or 600, 700 jin per mu, the general seeding rate is around 30 jin. Although there are as many as 60 jin, excessively increasing the seeding rate has little effect on increasing production.

The reason why different seeding rates result in roughly the same yield is mainly determined by the tillering nature of wheat. Wheat is a crop with tillering characteristics. Under a certain fertilization level, sparsely planted wheat has a large nutritional area per plant and more tillers; densely planted wheat has a small nutritional area per plant and fewer tillers. Therefore, when the seeding rate increases to a certain extent, the number of ears per unit area of wheat does not increase proportionally, or even increases very little, while the number of grains of wheat decreases accordingly. For example, a comparison of three high-yield fields in Chengguan Commune: for a seeding rate of 60 jin, there were 500,500 ears per mu and 16.7 grains per ear; for a seeding rate of 45 jin, there were 471,000 ears per mu and 20.5 grains per ear; for a seeding rate of 29 jin, there were 399,000 ears per mu and 28.6 grains per ear. The difference in seeding rate between the three fields was 15 to 31 jin, while the difference in the number of ears per mu was only 34,000 to 106,000, but the number of grains per ear was 8 to 12 more for the lower seeding rate. From this, it can be seen that when the seeding rate increases to a certain extent, the yield increase effect manifested by the increase in ears per unit area cannot offset the side effect of the decrease in the number of grains per ear after the seeding rate increases. Therefore, excessively increasing the seeding rate does not increase production proportionally. See Table 1.

Table 1

Mu Seeding Rate (jin)	Ears per mu (10,000)	Grains per Ear	Yield (jin)
60	50.5	16.7	603
45	47.1	20.5	663
29	39.9	28.66	80.3

The reason why the number of ears per mu cannot increase proportionally with the increase in the seeding rate is that in the case of excessive close planting, the wheat seedlings are crowded together, resulting in early death of seedlings and plants; after the wheat joints, the main stem elongates rapidly, and the small tillers at the base do not get enough sunlight, which also causes a large number of dead tillers. According to a survey of seven high-yield fields with a seeding rate of 45 jin in the third team of the Wutong Brigade of the Chengguan Commune, there was an average of 900,000 tillers per mu, 450,000 ears, and an effective ear rate of 50%; according to a survey of eleven high-yield fields with a seeding rate of 30 jin, there was an average of 770,000 tillers per mu, 411,000 ears, and an effective ear rate of 53.4%. There were 130,000 more tillers in the fields with a seeding rate of 45 jin than in the fields with a seeding rate of 30 jin, but in the end, there were only 39,000 more ears. This shows that the increase in the seeding rate reduces the effective ear rate instead. Therefore, the number of ears per mu cannot be increased in proportion to the increase in the seeding rate.

Excessively increasing the seeding rate not only increases dead plants and dead tillers, but also increases the proportion of small ears, and the number of grains per ear also decreases accordingly. The reason for the decrease in the number of grains per ear is mainly: after excessive close planting, the nutritional area of individual plants is reduced, resulting in malnutrition, which cannot fully meet the needs of spikelet differentiation, increasing infertile spikelets, reducing fertile ears, and making the ears smaller. According to a survey of 35 high-yield fields: when there are 200,000 to 350,000 plants per mu, large ears account for 26% to 41%, medium ears account for 35% to 40%, small ears account for 24% to 33%, and the average number of grains per ear is around 23; when there are 360,000 to 500,000 plants per mu, large ears only account for 18% to 25%, medium ears account for 39% to 44%, small ears account for about 38%, and the average number of grains per ear drops to 19.6; when there are 700,000 plants per mu, small ears with less than 10 grains per ear account for 89%, and the average number of grains per ear is 9.9.

Increasing the seeding rate reduces wheat tillering, increases the proportion of effective ears, and relatively reduces ineffective tillers. Before the ineffective tillers die, they can manufacture and accumulate some nutrients for the plant. After death, most of these nutrients can be transferred to the main stem, and their root system continues to absorb water and fertilizer, which is conducive to the growth and development of the main ear, promoting large ears and many grains. According to the analysis of some materials, for those with only one ear and no tillers, the stem length is 83.3 cm, the ear length is 4.69 cm, the number of fertile spikelets is 5.9, the number of infertile spikelets is 6.1, the number of grains per ear is 6.5, and the number of permanent roots is 5.6; those with five ears and one ineffective tiller have a stem length of 109.6 cm, an ear length of 6.6 cm, 9.8 fertile spikelets, 6.1 infertile spikelets, 16.2 grains per ear, and 6.7 permanent roots; those with one ear and two ineffective tillers have a stem length of 116 cm, an ear length of 6.8 cm, 11.3 fertile spikelets, 3.6 infertile spikelets, 20.5 grains per ear, and 9.4 permanent roots. From this, it can be seen that within a certain range, increasing ineffective tillers is beneficial to the growth and development of the main ear. This is also one of the reasons why the ears become smaller after increasing the seeding rate. See Table 2.

Table 2

Mu Plants (10,000)	Large Ears	Medium Ears	Small Ears	Grains	Average Grains/Ear
%	Grains	%	%
20-25	32	27.6	40	21	28	13.7	23.1
25-30	26	28.9	40	21	33	13.9	23.5
30-35	41	26.0	35	18.5	24	11.2	23.07
35-40	25	26.4	39	19.3	34	11.9	19.6
40-50	18	23.6	44	17.3	38	10.7	19.9

From the water and fertilizer conditions and farming level of the high-yield fields, the main reasons for the large number of dead plants, dead tillers, small ears, and few grains in wheat are not the lack of water and fertilizer, but insufficient light in the above-ground parts and reduced nutritional area of the underground root system. For example, the high-yield fields of the Caiyuan Team sowed 57 jin, plowed 1.2 chi deep, watered twice, and topdressed three times, equivalent to 105 jin of nitrogen. After emergence, an inspection showed 840,000 plants, but only 515,000 were harvested. After jointing, there were 1,650,000 tillers per mu, but only 710,000 ears were harvested; the average number of fertile spikelets was only 11.4, and the number of infertile spikelets reached 4.5, with an average of only 16.7 grains per ear. This shows that even if the soil is fertile, with large amounts of manure and sufficient water, it still cannot meet the needs of densely planted wheat fields, and cannot reduce the phenomenon of dead plants, dead tillers, small ears, and few grains. According to a survey at the "August 1st" Agricultural Science Research Institute of the Chengguan Commune: the larger the seeding rate, the more shading, and the less light, the weaker the wheat grows, the lighter the weight of the individual plant and the material of the basal stem nodes, and the weight of green leaves also decreases, and the number of permanent roots also decreases. Observation at the late heading stage of wheat showed that with a seeding rate of 30 jin, there were 438,000 ears per mu, and the light intensity between plants was 5% of the natural light intensity; with a seeding rate of 40 jin, there were 450,000 ears per mu, and the light intensity between plants was 4.3% of the natural light intensity; with a seeding rate of 60 jin, there were 582,000 ears per mu, and the light intensity between plants was 3.1% of the natural light intensity, that is, the light intensity for a seeding rate of 60 jin was two-fifths less than that for a seeding rate of 30 jin. A comparison of the stem weight, weight of the first and second nodes, weight of green leaves, weight of flag leaves, and the number of permanent roots for seeding rates of 30 jin, 40 jin, and 60 jin is shown in Table 3. These comparative figures show that the seeding rate of 30 jin receives more light, photosynthesis is more vigorous, more nutrients are produced, and more dry matter is accumulated. While the seeding rates of 40 jin and 60 jin gradually weaken photosynthesis, the stems are weak, the basal leaves turn yellow, fewer nutrients are produced, and less dry matter is accumulated. The phenomenon of photosynthesis degradation is even more significant with seeding rates of 60 jin to 100 jin. This is the main reason for dead plants, dead leaves, small ears, and few grains.

Table 3

Seeding Rate (jin)	Inter-Plant Light (% of Natural)	Single-Plant Stem Weight (g)	Stem 1st & 2nd Node Weight (g)	Green Leaf Weight (g)	Flag Leaf Weight (g)	Permanent Roots (count)
30	5	14.65	7.9	4.5	1.7	11.3
40	4.3	11.28	5.6	4.0	1.5	10.0
50	3.1	11.8	5.9	4.0	1.6	9.3
60	3.1	9.15	4.7	2.7	1.2	8.3
80	3.1	6.8	3.7	2.1	0.9	6.9
100	2.2	4.6	2.7	1.5	0.6	6.8

Secondly, after high-density planting, the lateral development of the root system of individual plants is restricted, the nutritional area is reduced, the wheat roots are entangled together, and the development is poor, affecting the ability to absorb water and fertilizer. This is also the reason for dead plants, dead tillers, small ears, and few grains.

Table 4

Seeding Rate	Single-Plant Root Weight (g)	Total Root Weight / Plant (g)
0-30 cm	30-60 cm	60-100 cm	Total (g)
30	0.078	0.014	0.008	0.150
80	0.064	0.012	0.009	0.085

Based on the above relationship between close planting and yield, close planting and the growth and development of wheat individuals and populations, and close planting and external conditions such as water, fertilizer, and light, it can be seen that: at a yield level of 600 to 700 jin per mu, when there are approximately 310,000 to 350,000 plants per mu and 350,000 to 450,000 ears, it can ensure the number of plants and ears necessary for increasing production per unit area, and also ensure good ear characteristics. If the number of plants increases and is greater than 310,000 to 350,000, although the number of ears increases, the effective tillering and the number of grains per ear are significantly reduced, and the yield is not high; if it is less than 310,000 to 350,000, the number of ineffective tillers increases, the number of ears decreases, the number of grains per ear does not increase much, and the yield decreases. See Table 5.

Table 5

Plants per mu	Effective Ears (10,000)	Effective Tillers (per plant)	Ineffective Tillers	Fertile Spikelets	Grains / Ear	1000-Grain Weight (g)	Yield jin / mu	Survey Field Count
20-25	37.1	1.52	2.22	13.3	23.1	34.1	459.8	10
25.1-30	40.2	1.39	1.42	13.3	23.5	32.6	473.3	7
30.1-35	42.9	1.32	1.24	12.0	23.1	34.9	556.8	7
35.1-40	42.1	1.30	1.90	11.3	19.6	33.0	504.0	3

70+	66.1	0.92	0.40	5.9	9.9	28.9	464.1	1

Note: The above yields are the average of the plants threshed from three square meters.

In order to ensure that there are 310,000 to 350,000 plants per mu, it is generally recommended to sow about 25 to 30 jin, but a few jin less can be sown for small-grain seeds; and a few jin more can be sown for late-sown and varieties with weak tillering ability.

Topdressing Early, Many Grains and Plump Grains

After deep plowing and dense planting, more fertilizer must be applied to fully exert the expected yield increase effect of wheat.

Due to the large population and limited land, and the high multiple cropping index, the local people have always attached importance to accumulating and conserving fertilizer. The county has a total of 80,000 earthen jar ponds in the fields, each accumulating 200 to 300 dan of fertilizer. In terms of fertilization technology, "wheat is fertilized three times" (base fertilizer, winter fertilizer, spring fertilizer), achieving early topdressing and applying large amounts of organic fertilizer, and applying coarse fertilizer carefully (ditch application, nest application).

The high-yield fields are all irrigated wheat, generally two crops a year, and some three crops a year. Because the previous crop is harvested late and the land preparation time is tight, most wheat fields apply a large amount of organic fertilizer as wheat base fertilizer in the late stage of the previous crop and corn growth; later, in November, during the wheat tillering stage, winter fertilizer is applied once, and wax fertilizer is applied once before freezing around December. Spring fertilizer is applied again at the end of January and the beginning of February when wheat turns green, generally applying 2,000 to 3,000 jin of human manure per mu, 4,000 to 5,000 jin of grass manure and soil manure, or 5,000 to 6,000 jin of house soil, and some also apply 20 to 30 jin of chemical fertilizer or 50 to 60 jin of cotton seed cake. Each mu is equivalent to applying about 25 to 35 jin of pure nitrogen. According to the local people's fertilization habits, the experience of old farmers and the yield situation over the years, a yield of 600 to 700 jin per mu generally requires the application of 3,000 jin of human manure, 8,000 jin of grass fertilizer, and 30 jin of ammonium sulfate, equivalent to about 38 jin of nitrogen; a yield of 500 to 600 jin requires the application of 2,500 jin of human manure, 6,000 jin of grass fertilizer, and 20 jin of ammonium sulfate, equivalent to about 31 jin of pure nitrogen. If this fertilization level is not reached, it will be difficult to guarantee the yield.

According to this year's survey of the amount of fertilizer applied in 31 high-yield fields in the Chengguan Commune and 15 high-yield fields in the Chengbo Commune, the average yield per mu is about 16.5 jin to 20.5 jin of nitrogen for 300 to 400 jin; about 20.2 jin to 27 jin of nitrogen for 400 to 500 jin; about 24.2 jin to 32.3 jin of nitrogen for 500 to 600 jin; and about 38.5 jin of nitrogen for 600 to 700 jin. This is roughly consistent with the people's experience, and it can be initially seen that, under the existing yield level, about 400 jin of nitrogen needs to be added for every 100 jin of yield increase.

A small number of high-yield fields apply as much as 50 to 60 jin of nitrogen per mu, and some even reach 105 jin of nitrogen. However, the yield is not high. The main reasons are: on the one hand, some fertilizers did not exert their fertilizer efficiency in the current year and could not be absorbed and utilized by wheat; on the other hand, too much quick-acting fertilizer was applied, causing the stems and leaves to grow excessively, resulting in early lodging and severely reducing production. For example, the County Agricultural Science Research Institute had a piece of Bima No. 4 wheat that applied 55 jin of nitrogen per mu, and lodging began on May 2nd, before wheat heading and flowering, and the yield per mu was only 425 jin. From this, it can be seen that under certain conditions, applying too much fertilizer will not only fail to increase production, but will also reduce production.

Striving to apply wheat base fertilizer in the late autumn and applying topdressing fertilizer as early as possible is a successful experience that the masses have accumulated over a long period of time to suit the specific local conditions. However, it is still necessary to increase the application of base fertilizer when conditions permit. For example, the Wutong Brigade and the Hanzhuang Brigade used 30 jin of seed per mu and 36 jin of nitrogen for high-yield fields. The yield per mu was 412.7 jin without base fertilizer, and the yield per mu was 529.8 jin with 5,000 jin of grass fertilizer as base fertilizer, an increase of 28%. The main reason for the yield increase is: there were more tillers before the New Year with base fertilizer applied, and the effective tillers were 1.47; there were fewer tillers before the New Year without base fertilizer applied, and the effective tillers were only 1.1. Therefore, the number of ears per mu increased by 36,000 for those with base fertilizer applied compared to those without base fertilizer.

Due to the lack of base fertilizer, the amount and timing of winter topdressing are particularly important. According to a survey of 30 high-yield fields, the average yield per mu was 506 jin, and 15.4 jin of nitrogen was topdressed before winter, accounting for 61%. 9.9 jin of nitrogen was topdressed after winter, accounting for 39%. The earlier the winter topdressing is applied, the more tillers the seedlings produce before the New Year, the better the root system develops, the stronger the growth, and the higher the yield. This year, the high-yield fields generally topdressed 20 days to one month earlier than in previous years, which has a great effect on increasing tillering before the New Year and increasing the number of effective ears. For example, both the 150 mu of high-yield fields in Dongjie and the 30 mu of high-yield fields north of Wutong Village used 30 jin of seed and 36 jin of nitrogen. The Dongjie high-yield fields topdressed 4,000 jin of thatch fertilizer when the wheat was at the three-leaf stage 20 days after sowing, and the Wutong Village North high-yield fields topdressed 3,500 jin of thatch manure 38 days after sowing. As a result, the single-plant permanent roots of the Dongjie high-yield fields were 13.8, the effective tillers were 1.5, and the ineffective tillers were 0.32, and there were 500,200 ears per mu, with a yield of 603.4 jin per mu. The single-plant permanent roots of the Wutong Village North high-yield fields decreased to 10.9, the effective tillers decreased to 1.2, the ineffective tillers increased to 0.9, and there were only 424,000 ears per mu, a decrease of 78,000 ears, with a yield of 573.2 jin per mu.

Early spring topdressing can consolidate tillers before the New Year, extend the time for spikelet differentiation, increase the number of fertile spikelets, increase the number of grains per ear, and also play an important role in increasing yield, especially when less fertilizer is applied in winter, the effect is more significant. The 22 mu of high-yield fields in the eighth team of the Wutong Brigade were flooded in the autumn during intercropping of corn and soybeans, and no base fertilizer was applied. 30 jin of seeds were sown, and 50 jin of cottonseed cake was applied in winter. When it began to turn green, 20 jin of calcium ammonium nitrate was applied. Among them, 13 mu applied 5,000 jin of house soil before jointing after turning green. As a result, the effective tillers of the early spring fertilized fields were 1.8, which was 0.5 more than those without topdressing, 15.2 fertile spikelets, an increase of 3.5, 30 grains per ear, an increase of 8 grains, a thousand-grain weight of 38.8 grams, an increase of 2.7 grams, and a yield of 548 jin, an increase of 76 jin, an increase of about 14%.

Based on the above analysis, the amount of fertilizer applied in high-yield fields with a yield of 600 to 700 jin per mu should be no less than 30 jin of nitrogen. Attention should be paid to base fertilizer when applying fertilizer, and phased topdressing should be implemented, especially winter topdressing should be applied early and in large quantities.

Deep Plowing the Land, Heavy Roots, Many Ears

The wheat fields in the high-yield fields are generally plowed about one chi deep, and some are plowed two to three chi deep, which is generally four or five cun deeper than the average wheat land in 1958. Deep plowing of the land has shown a huge effect in increasing wheat production this year. Deep plowing can thicken and loosen the soil layer, improve the physical properties of the soil, regulate soil moisture, air, and humidity, and create conditions for nutrient decomposition and biological activity; deep plowing can also turn dead soil into live soil and live soil into fertile soil, forming a deep and fertile soil layer in a short period of time. According to observations two days after rain in the contrast test fields of deep plowing and shallow plowing in the Dongjie Brigade, the soil porosity at 30-60 cm for deep plowing of 60 cm is larger than that for shallow plowing of 30 cm, and the capacity is one-quarter to one-third lighter. This obviously has a great effect on solving the contradiction between water and air in the soil, and is conducive to root development. According to a comparison of deep plowing of 1.2 chi and shallow plowing of 7 cun in the Wutong Brigade, in a soil layer with an area of 400 square centimeters and a depth of 3 chi, the single-plant permanent roots of deep plowing are 9.1, and those of shallow plowing are 8.4. The single-plant root weight of deep plowing is also significantly heavier than that of shallow plowing. See Table 6.

Table 6

Plowing Depth (chi)	Single-Plant Root Count	Single-Plant Root Weight in Each Layer (g)	Total Weight (g)
1 chi	2 chi	3 chi
1.2	9.1	0.431	0.077	0.053	0.561
0.7	8.4	0.285	0.047	0.020	0.352

Due to the increase in the number and weight of wheat roots after deep plowing, the function of absorbing water and nutrients also increases; the effective ear rate of deep plowing of 1.2 chi is 45.9%, which is 12.1% higher than that of shallow plowing of 7 cun; the effective tillers of deep plowing are 1.2, which is 0.15 more than that of shallow plowing; the ineffective tillers are 1.3, which is 0.3 less than that of shallow plowing; the stem length is 112.4 cm, which is 17.2 cm higher than that of shallow plowing; the spikelet percentage is 27%, which is 23% less than that of shallow plowing. Due to the increase in the number of effective ears and the decrease in the spikelet percentage, the yield per mu of deep plowing is 472.1 jin, which is also 8.8% higher than the 433.8 jin of shallow plowing.

Deep plowing also creates conditions for rational close planting and increased fertilizer application. After wheat is densely planted, it needs a larger space for root extension and an area for absorbing nutrients. Deep plowing combined with fertilization can meet this requirement and further enhance the yield-increasing effect of rational close planting. For example, it was previously believed that increasing the seeding rate would reduce the size of wheat ears. However, dense planting based on deep plowing can also appropriately change this situation. For example, the high-yield field in Dongjie Brigade with deep plowing of 60 cm and a seeding rate of 60 jin, with 569,000 ears per mu, has a 40% increase in single-plant root weight compared to the high-yield field with deep plowing of 30 cm and a seeding rate of 30 jin, with 500,500 ears per mu, a 0.3 increase in permanent roots, and 17.1 fertile grains, with an increase of 0.4 grains per ear, indicating that the ears do not become smaller. Deep plowing of 60 cm yields 631 jin per mu, and deep plowing of 30 cm yields 603 jin per mu, an increase of 5%.

After deep plowing, the proportion of wheat roots in the lower soil layer increases, indicating that wheat roots have a tendency to extend downward and expand their distribution range. For example, a survey in the Chengbo Commune showed that in wheat fields with shallow plowing of 5 to 6 cun and deep plowing of 1.1 chi to 1.2 chi, the

    运用“八字宪法”赢得小麦高产
    河南孟县小麦大面积丰产方技术经验总结
    内容提要
    以深耕为基础，密植为中心，水肥为前提，全面地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，是获得小麦大面积高产的关键。
    决定小麦产量的是单位面积上的株数、穗数、粒数和粒重。合理增加播种量，可以直接增加单位面积上的株数和穗数；保持单株一定的营养面积，就能保证穗大穗多。但是过多的增加播种量，不仅死株死蘖增加，而且小穗的比重增加，每穗的粒数也相应减少，结果造成减产。
    争取在晚秋地里施小麦底肥和及早施追肥的办法，是孟县今年小麦丰产的一条成功经验。冬季追肥时间愈早，幼苗年前分蘖愈多，根系发育好，生长健壮，产量高；早春追肥，可以巩固年前分蘖，增加结实小穗，对提高产量有重要作用。小麦密植以后，根系更需要伸展和扩大吸收养分的面积。深耕结合施肥就可以满足这个要求，就会进一步发挥合理密植的作用。
    浇水适量适时，经常保持土壤含水量在16％至20％，基本上能满足小麦各个生长期的需要。
    造成倒伏的主要原因是由于培育技术不当，施肥过多、过晚，或浇水过多、过勤。今年孟县防止倒伏的主要经验是适量施肥，控制浇水，选用良种和适时播种。
    河南孟县县委在人民公社化的新形势下，在总结1958年农业生产大跃进的基础上，有计划地培育了小麦大面积丰产方。经过八个月的苦战，现在普遍获得了丰收。
    孟县丰产小麦田耕的深，种的密，施肥多，是以往任何一年所没有的。其中，有经验，也有教训。认真地、系统地总结这些经验教训，对进一步提高小麦栽培技术水平，争取今后更大丰收有重要意义。
    丰产方全部选用白玉皮、碧蚂一号、平原五○等良种；土地一般深翻一尺左右；寒露前后适时播种，每亩播种三十斤；施肥七千至八千斤；冬春耙锄二至三遍，拔草一、二次；并普遍进行了浸种、选种、土壤消毒、消灭吸浆虫、熏烟防霜等防灾保收工作。
    丰产方的小麦生长特点是：（一）株多、穗大、籽多、粒饱、茎秆粗壮，生长整齐。（二）除个别高额丰产试验田外，一般都没有倒伏。
    收获前的田间取样调查，一般每亩三十五万至四十五万穗左右，每穗有二十至二十五粒，千粒重三十三点一克（合一万五千粒一斤），倒伏麦田不足1％。
    根据以上特点，总结丰产方的栽培技术经验，主要有以下五点：
        合　理　密　植
    决定小麦产量的是单位面积上的株数、穗数、粒数和粒重。丰产方一般每亩播种三十斤，行距三点五寸，比去年增加播种量十至十二斤，缩小行距一点五寸至三点五寸。增加播种量可以直接增加单位面积上的株数和穗数，缩小行距可以使小麦均匀分布，保持单株一定的营养面积，保证穗大穗多。这是丰产方获得大面积平衡增产的重要措施之一。
    根据在城关、城伯等地调查，今年丰产方每亩约有二十至四十万株，一般为三十万株上下；每亩有二十六万穗至五十六万穗，多数麦田在三十五万穗至四十五万穗之间，平均四十万穗左右。根据城关公社四个大队六百多亩丰产田的调查：亩产六百至七百斤的平均播种量为四十一斤，四十三万三千穗，每穗粒数二十一点三粒；亩产五百至六百斤的平均播种量为三十五点一斤，四十一万四千穗，每穗粒数二十五点八粒；亩产四百斤至五百斤的平均播种量三十三点九斤，四十万零七千穗，每穗粒数二十三点七粒。总的看来，在当地现有耕作水平和亩产四百至七百斤产量范围内，产量越高，所用播种量较多，每亩穗数也较多，但每亩穗数大致都在四十万左右，相差不大。这是由于水、肥、土、种等栽培条件的影响造成的。
    另一情况，在同一产量范围内，播种量相差却比较悬殊。如在四百斤至五百斤的麦田中，最高的播种四十五斤，一般三十斤左右，最低的十八点八斤；在五百至六百斤的麦田中，最高的播种四十五斤，一般三十斤，最低二十五斤；在六百至七百斤的麦田中，最高六十斤，一般三十多斤，最低二十九斤。从以上材料可以看出，无论亩产三、四百斤或六、七百斤，一般播种量都在三十斤左右，虽有多至六十斤，但过多的增加播种量，对增产的作用不大。
    播种量不同而产量大致相同的原因，主要是由小麦的分蘖本性所决定的。小麦是有分蘖特性的作物，在一定施肥水平下，稀植的小麦单株营养面积大、分蘖多；密植的小麦单株营养面积小，分蘖少。因此，当播种量增加到一定程度时，小麦单位面积上的穗数，并不成正比例增加，甚至很少增加，而小麦的粒数却相应的减少。如城关公社三块丰产田对比：播种六十斤的，每亩五十万零五千穗，每穗十六点七粒；播种四十五斤的，每亩四十七万一千穗，每穗二十点五粒；播种二十九斤的，每亩三十九万九千穗，每穗二十八点六粒。三块田播种量相差十五至三十一斤，而每亩穗数只相差三万四千穗至十万六千穗，但是播种量少的，每穗粒数却比播种量大的多八至十二粒。由此可见，播种量增加到一定程度，单位面积内因穗子增加所表现的增产作用，抵不上播种量增加以后每穗粒数减少的副作用。因此，过多的增加播种量，产量并不按比例的增加。见表一。
    表一
    亩播种量（斤）  每亩穗数（万）  每穗粒数  产量（斤）
    60  50.5  16.7  603
    45  47.1  20.5  663
    29  39.9  28.66  80.3
    播种量增加，每亩穗数不能成比例增加的原因，是在过分密植的情况下，麦苗密挤一起，有早期死苗死株现象；在小麦拔节后，主茎迅速伸长，基部小分蘖阳光不足，又造成大量死蘖现象。据城关公社梧桐大队第三队七块播种量四十五斤的丰产田调查，平均每亩有九十万分蘖，四十五万穗，有效穗率为50％；另据十一块播种三十斤的丰产田调查，平均每亩有七十七万分蘖、四十一万一千穗，有效穗率为53.4％。播种四十五斤的比播种三十斤的多十三万分蘖，但最后只多三万九千穗。这说明播种量增加，有效穗率相反的减低。因此，每亩穗数不能按播种量的增加比例增加。
    过多的增加播种量，不仅死株死蘖增加，而且小穗的比重增加，每穗的粒数也相应减少。每穗粒数减少的原因主要是：过分密植后，单株营养面积减少，营养不良，不能充分满足小穗分化的需要，不孕小穗增加，结实小，穗减少，穗子变小。根据三十五块丰产田的调查：当每亩二十至三十五万株时，大穗占26％至41％，中穗占35％至40％，小穗占24％至33％，平均每穗粒数都在二十三粒左右；每亩三十六万至五十万株时，大穗只占18％至25％，中穗占39％至44％，小穗占38％左右，平均每穗粒数下降到十九点六粒；每亩七十万株时，每穗不到十粒的小穗占89％，平均每穗九点九粒。
    播种量增加，小麦分蘖减少，有效穗比重增加，无效分蘖相对的减少。无效分蘖在死亡以前，可以为植株制造积累一些养料，死亡后这些养料大部分可以向主茎转移，而且其根系继续有吸收水肥的作用，都有利于主穗的生长发育，促使穗大粒多。根据部分材料分析，凡只有一个穗，没有分蘖的，秆长为八十三点三厘米，穗长为四点六九厘米，结实小穗为五点九个，不孕小穗为六点一个，每穗粒数为六点五粒，永久根为五点六条；有五个穗，一个无效分蘖的，秆长为一百零九点六厘米，穗长为六点六厘米，结实小穗为九点八个，不孕小穗为六点一个，每穗粒数为十六点二粒，永久根为六点七根；有一个穗、二个无效分蘖的秆长为一百一十六厘米，穗长为六点八厘米，结实小穗为十一点三个，不孕小穗为三点六个，每穗粒数为二十点五粒，永久根为九点四根。由此可见，在一定范围内无效分蘖增加，有利主穗的生长发育。这也是增加播种量以后，穗子变小的原因之一。见表二。
      表二每亩株（万）  大穗  中穗    小穗  粒数  平均每穗粒数
        ％  粒数  ％         ％        20—25  32  27.6  40  21    28  13.7  23.125—30  26  28.9  40  21    33  13.9  23.530—35  41  26.0  35  18.5  24  11.2  23.0735—40  25  26.4  39  19.3  34  11.9  19.640—50  18  23.6  44  17.3  38  10.7  19.9
    从丰产田的水肥条件、耕作水平来看，小麦大量死株、死蘖和穗小、粒少的主要原因，不是水肥不足，而是地上部分的光照不够和地下根系营养面积减少。如菜园队的丰产田播种五十七斤，深翻一点二尺，浇水两次，追肥三次，折合氮一百零五斤。出苗后检查有八十四万株，但收获的仅五十一万五千株，拔节后每亩有一百六十五万分蘖，收获时仅七十一万穗；平均结实小穗仅十一点四个，不孕小穗达四点五个，平均每穗仅十六点七粒。这说明即使土壤肥沃、粪大、水足，仍然不能满足密植麦田的需要，不能减少死株死蘖和穗小粒少的现象。根据在城关公社“八一”农业科学研究所的调查：播种量越大，遮光越多，光照不足，小麦生长纤弱，单株和基部茎节秆物质重量减轻，绿叶重量也减轻，永久根也减少。在小麦抽穗后期观察，播种三十斤，每亩四十三万八千穗，株间光照强度为自然光照强度的5％；播种四十斤，每亩四十五万穗，株间光照强度为自然光照强度的4.3％；播种六十斤，每亩五十八万二千穗，株间光照强度为自然光照强度的3.1％，就是说，播种六十斤的光照强度比三十斤的少五分之二点九。播种三十斤、四十斤、六十斤的单株秆重、第一、二节重、绿叶重、旗叶重以及永久根的数量对比见表三。这些对比数字说明播种三十斤的接受的光照多，光合作用比较旺盛，制造的养分多，积累的干物质多。而播种四十斤和六十斤，则光合作用逐渐衰弱，茎秆细弱，基部叶片变黄，制造的养分少，积累的干物质也少。播种六十斤至一百斤的，光合作用衰退现象愈加显著。这是造成死株、死叶、穗小、粒少的主要原因。

    其次，高度密植以后单株根系向横的方向发展受到限制，营养面积缩小，麦根纠缠一起，发育不良，影响吸收水肥的能力。这也是造成死株、死蘖、穗小粒少的原因。

    根据以上密植与产量，密植与小麦个体和群体的生长发育，密植与外界水肥、光照等条件的关系，可以看到：在亩产六百至七百斤的产量水平下，在每亩三十一至三十五万株、三十五至四十五万穗左右时，既能保证单位面积上增产所必需的株数穗数，又能保证穗部性状良好。株数增加，大于三十一至三十五万株，虽然穗数增加，但有效分蘖和每穗粒数显著降低，产量不高；小于三十一万至三十五万株，则无效分蘖增加，穗数减少，每穗粒数增加不多，产量降低。见表五。

    注：以上产量是三个平方米植株脱粒后的平均数。
    为了保证每亩有三十一到三十五万株，一般可播种二十五至三十斤左右，但小粒种可适当少播几斤；晚播的和分蘖力弱的品种，可适当多播几斤。
    及早追肥　籽多粒饱
    深耕密植以后，必须增施肥料，才能充分发挥小麦应有的增产效果。
    由于人多地少，复种指数高，当地群众一贯重视积肥保肥工作。全县共有八万个地头瓦罐茅池，每个积肥二、三百担。在施肥技术方面，“麦施三遍肥”（底肥、冬肥、春肥），做到了及早追肥，大量施用有机肥料，粗肥细施（沟施、窝施）。
    丰产方都是水地小麦，一般一年两熟，部分一年三熟。由于前作收获晚，翻地时间紧，大部分麦田在前作、玉米生长后期都追施大量有机肥料，以作麦田底肥；以后，在11月间小麦分蘖期追一次冬肥，在12月间封冻前后追一次腊肥，在1月底2月初小麦返青时再追一次春肥，一般亩施人粪尿二至三千斤，草粪、土粪四、五千斤或房土五、六千斤，有的并施化肥二、三十斤，或棉仁饼五、六十斤。每亩约合施纯氮二十五至三十五斤。根据当地群众施肥习惯、老农经验与历年产量情况，一般亩产六百至七百斤的产量，约需施人粪尿三千斤，草肥八千斤，硫铵三十斤，约合三十八斤氮；五百至六百斤的产量，约需施人粪尿两千五百斤，草粪六千斤，硫铵二十斤，约合三十一斤纯氮。如果达不到这个施肥水平，产量就难保证。
    根据今年在城关公社三十一块丰产田和城伯公社十五块丰产田的施肥量的调查，平均亩产三百至四百斤的，约施氮十六点五斤至二十点五斤；亩产四百至五百斤的约施氮二十点二斤至二十七斤；亩产五百至六百斤的约施氮二十四点二斤至三十二点三斤；亩产六百至七百斤的约施氮三十八点五斤。与群众经验大致相符，并初步可以看出，在现有产量水平下，大概每增加一百斤产量，需要增施四百斤氮左右。
    少数丰产田，每亩施肥量高达五、六十斤氮，多的达到一百零五斤氮。但是，产量不高，其主要原因：一方面是有部分肥料，当年肥效没有发挥，不能被小麦吸收利用；另一方面是速效性肥料施用过多，茎叶陡长，早期倒伏，严重减产。如县农业科学研究所有一块碧蚂四号小麦，每亩施五十五斤氮，在5月2日小麦抽穗扬花前，就开始倒伏，亩产仅四百二十五斤。由此可知，在一定的条件下，施肥过多，不仅不能增产，反而减产。
    争取在晚秋地里上小麦底肥和及早追肥的办法，是群众长期积累、适应当地具体情况的一条成功经验。但是，在有条件情况下，增施底肥还是需要的。如梧桐大队和韩庄大队，每亩播种三十斤左右，施用三十六斤氮的丰产田，未施底肥的亩产四百一十二点七斤；用五千斤草粪作底肥的亩产五百二十九点八斤，增产28％。增产的主要原因是：施底肥的年前分蘖多，有效分蘖为一点四七个；未施底肥的年前分蘖少，有效分蘖仅一点一个。因此，施底肥的每亩穗数比不施底肥的增加三万六千穗。
    由于未施底肥，冬季追肥的数量和时间也就特别重要。根据三十块丰产田的调查，平均亩产五百零六斤，冬前追施十五点四斤氮，占61％。冬后追施九点九斤氮，占39％。冬季追肥时间愈早，幼苗年前分蘖愈多，根系发育好，生长健壮，产量也愈高。今年丰产方普遍的比往年提前追肥二十天到一个月左右，对增加年前分蘖，增加有效穗数作用很大。如东街一百五十亩丰产田和梧桐村北三十亩丰产田，同样都播种三十斤，使用三十六斤氮，东街丰产田在播种后二十天，小麦三叶期追茅肥四千斤，梧桐村北丰产田延迟在播种后三十八天追茅粪三千五百斤，结果东街丰产田单株永久根十三点八个，有效分蘖为一点五个，无效分蘖零点三二个，每亩有五十万零二千穗，亩产六百零三点四斤，而梧桐村北丰产田单株永久根减少为十点九个，有效分蘖减少为一点二个，无效分蘖增加到零点九个，每亩仅四十二万四千穗，减少七万八千穗，亩产五百七十三点二斤。
    早春追肥，可以巩固年前分蘖，延长小穗分化时间，增加结实小穗数，增加每穗粒数，对提高产量也有重要作用，特别是冬季施肥较少的情况下，效果更加显著。梧桐大队八小队的二十二亩丰产田，秋季玉米间作大豆受淹，未施底肥，播种三十斤，冬季追棉饼五十斤，开始返青时，又追硝酸铵钙二十斤，其中十三亩在返青后拔节前，又多追房土五千斤，结果早春多施一次肥的有效分蘖为一点八个，比未追肥的多零点五个，结实小穗十五点二个，增加三点五个，每穗粒数三十粒，增加八粒，千粒重三十八点八克，增加二点七克，产量五百四十八斤，增产七十六斤，约增产14％左右。
    根据以上情况分析，一般亩产六百至七百斤的丰产田，施肥量应不少于三十斤氮。施肥时应重视底肥，实行分期追肥，特别是冬前追肥要早施多施。
    深翻土地　根重穗多
    丰产方的麦田普遍深翻一尺左右，部分深翻二至三尺，一般比1958年一般麦地耕深增加四、五寸左右。深翻土地在今年小麦增产中显示了巨大的作用。深耕可以加厚和疏松土层，改良土壤的物理性状，调节土壤水分、空气和湿度，为养料分解和生物活动创造条件；深耕还可以使死土变活土、活土变油土，在短时期内就形成深厚肥沃土层。根据东街大队深耕、浅翻对比试验田在雨后两天观察，深翻六十厘米的，在三十至六十厘米处比浅翻三十厘米的土壤孔隙大，容量轻四分之一到三分之一。这显然对解决土壤中水分和空气的矛盾有很大作用，有利于根部发育。根据梧桐大队深翻一尺二寸和浅翻七寸的对比，在面积四百平方厘米、深三尺的土层中，深翻的单株永久根为九点一根，浅翻的为八点四根，深耕的单株根重，也显著地比浅耕的重。见表六。
    表六

　0．7　  8．4　  0．285  0．047  0．020  0．352
    由于深翻后小麦根数和根重的增加，吸收水分和养料的功能也随之增加；深翻一尺二寸的有效穗率为45.9％，比浅耕七寸的有效穗率增加12.1％；深耕的有效分蘖为一点二个，比浅耕的增加零点一五个；无效分蘖为一点三个，比浅耕的少零点三个；秆长一百一十二点四厘米，比浅耕的高十七点二厘米；小穗百分率27％，比浅耕的少23％。由于有效穗数增加和小穗百分率的减少，深耕的亩产四百七十二点一斤，也比浅耕的四百三十三点八斤增产8.8％。
    深耕也为合理密植和增施肥料创造了条件。小麦密植以后，需要有更大的根系伸展空间和吸收养分面积。深耕结合施肥就可以满足这个要求，进一步发挥合理密植的增产作用。如过去认为增加播种量，小麦穗子就会变小。但在深耕的基础上密植，也可以适当改变这种情况。如东街大队深耕六十厘米，播种六十斤，每亩五十六万九千穗的丰产田，比深耕三十厘米，播种三十斤，每亩五十万零五千穗的丰产田单株根重增加40％，永久根增加零点三根，结实十七点一粒，每穗粒数增加零点四粒，可见穗子并不变小。深耕六十厘米，亩产六百三十一斤，深耕三十厘米亩产六百零三斤，增产5％。
    深翻以后，下层土壤中麦根的比例增加，说明麦根有向下伸展、分布范围扩大的趋势。如在城伯公社调查：浅耕五至六寸和深翻一尺一寸至一尺二寸的麦田，浅耕的根群分布在二十公分以下的占7.5％，深翻的有16.8％。
    由于下层土壤中的麦根比重增加，根系延伸较深，植株的营养面积加大。因此，深翻一尺二寸的单株分蘖增加了零点七个，每穗粒重增加零点一四克，亩产四百六十六斤，比浅翻的亩产三百二十二斤增产44％。
    总的看来，深翻以后，小麦的永久根数和根重增加，对增加有效穗数和每穗粒数都有良好作用。但从深翻第一年的情况看来，深翻二尺以上的增产效果和深翻一尺的比较，还不十分显著；而深翻一尺左右的比浅耕五至六寸的显著增产。深翻二尺所需要的劳力约为深翻一尺的三至五倍。因此，在当前农村劳畜力还比较紧张的情况下，还以深翻一尺左右为宜。
    适时浇水　苗全株壮
    丰产方的小麦都是水浇地，一般每亩七十至八十个畦，畦宽七尺，长十五尺，高三尺。块块达到了高级园田化。三肥五水（底墒水、冬水、返青水、拔节水、灌浆水）和五肥七水（底墒水、冬水、返青水、拔节水、孕穗水、扬花水、灌浆水），是孟县固有的浇水经验。从小麦生长发育各个时期需水情况来看，在这些时期，进行灌水都是适宜的。今年小麦生育期间总降雨量二百七十五点四毫米，每亩约合一百八十四公方。除4月份降雨较少外，整个生育期间雨量分布均匀。小麦播种到出苗，降雨五十六点八毫米，保证了出苗整齐、苗全、苗壮；封冻前二十天，降雨七十六点九毫米，基本上代替了冬水。由于越冬期间土壤水分充足，有利于植株在适宜的温度范围内滋生分蘖，增加年前分蘖，增加有效穗数。1月下旬和2月上旬小麦返青期，又降雨十三点四毫米，加上冬季土壤中储存的水分，这时土壤含水量达22％，可以充分供应早春小麦返青生长的需要。从返青至拔节，小麦需水量逐渐增加。这一时期共降雨四十八点一毫米，土壤含水量22.5％左右。肥多墒饱，有利于穗的分化，促使穗大穗多。4月份降雨仅一点一毫米，但在4月20日以前，土壤湿度仍在15％—20％之间；4月底抽穗开花期间，稍嫌缺水。根据今年降水和土壤含水量情况，丰产方的小麦灵活地运用了五水、七水的经验，一般没有浇水或只浇一、二水，但是在少雨月份适当浇水，仍有显著增产效果。例如，梧桐大队有二亩八分丰产田，品种、播种量、施肥量均相同，有一半在4月份浇水比不浇水的每亩就增加九万穗，每穗粒数增加二点二粒，产量增加六十五斤，增产13％。
    根据今年经验，如果降水适时，土壤含水量在16％至20％，田间最大持水量在65％至70％的，基本上能满足小麦各个生长发育时期的需要，不必浇水。如果浇水不当，土壤含水量超过以上范围，往往会引起小麦茎叶陡长，容易发生倒伏。今年丰产方的小麦普遍没有倒伏，与掌握以上土壤含水量、控制浇水有密切关系。
    防止倒伏　秆粗粒重
    防止小麦倒伏是保证达到高产的重要措施之一。丰产方的小麦今年种植密度大，株多、穗多、穗大、粒饱生长整齐、茎秆粗壮。除个别丰产试验田外，普遍没有倒伏，这是丰产方小麦生长突出的特点。根据在城关公社的调查，倒伏愈早，减产愈多。在4月18日（孕穗期）倒伏的小麦，死蘖增加，籽粒小，减产达到31.6％；在5月19日（乳熟期）倒伏的，千粒重也比不倒伏的减轻11.8％。
    今年丰产方防止倒伏的主要经验是：适量施肥，控制用水，选用良种和适时播种。
    过去认为倒伏主要是由密植造成的，但根据孟县今年五万亩丰产方的经验，过分密植的麦田，通风透光不良，对茎秆健壮有一定影响，但小麦倒伏与密度并没有绝对的关系。倒伏的麦田不一定是由于密植，而合理密植的麦田不一定倒伏。从大的方面来看，去年全县小麦播种十八到二十斤，麦田倒伏面积约占6％左右，今年播种量增加到三十斤，倒伏面积仅0.6％。从典型调查材料来看，今年有播种十八点八斤而倒伏的，也有播种六十斤而没有倒伏的。根据调查材料分析，造成倒伏的主要原因是由于栽培技术不当，特别是施用氮肥过多、过晚或浇水过多过勤。品种本身的抗倒伏性能也有一定关系。如东街大队一百五十亩丰产田播种三十斤，每亩折合施用纯氮三十七斤半。即11月1日，每亩施人粪尿四千斤，2月中旬施房土、草粪五千斤，5月初每亩追硫铵三十斤，生长健壮，秆硬不倒，平均每亩产量为六百零三点四斤。而县农业科学研究所只播种十八点八斤，施肥量折合每亩纯氮五十五斤，即基肥棉饼一百斤，11月20日追人粪六千斤，3月4日追硫铵二十五斤，3月10日追土化肥四千斤，4月19日根外追施过磷酸钙三斤，硫铵半斤，在5月2日有40％倒伏，至5月20日全部倒伏，亩产仅四百二十五斤。由此可知，倒伏不一定是由于密植，只播种十八斤半的施用氮肥过多也要倒伏。又如梧桐大队有一块丰产田播种四十五斤，在11月25日追人粪尿三千五百斤，3月10日追人粪尿二千五百斤，共施纯氮三十六斤，没有倒伏。其中有二亩三分，12月5日追人粪尿四千斤，2月28日追硫铵三十斤，至4月1日又追硫铵六十五斤，共施纯氮四十七斤，至4月18日就大量倒伏，倒伏的麦田永久根比不倒伏的少三根，基部第一、二茎节显著伸长。这说明春季大量追施氮肥，茎叶茂盛，严重遮阴，光照不足，根、茎生长发育不良，茎的基部节间细长，机械组织减少，细胞壁变薄，是促使倒伏的直接原因。
    早期倒伏，无效分蘖增加，有效穗数减少，每穗粒数和千粒重显著减低。籽粒重量仅占全株重量的18.4％，草多粒轻，因此，减产达31.6％。
    灌水不当也是造成小麦倒伏的主要原因。三肥五水的经验，必须结合具体情况，要“看天、看地、看庄稼”灵活掌握浇水时间和水量。今年的小麦从种到收，除抽穗开花时降雨较少外，返青、拔节时雨水适时，土壤水分始终保持在20％上下。根据这个情况，大部丰产田都没有灌水。没有灌水的麦田一般都没有倒伏。县农业科学研究所丰产田播种量仅二十五斤左右，由于在返青、拔节时期连浇二水（在未灌水的土壤中含水已在20％以上），结果全部倒伏。
    在同样的播种密度、施肥、灌溉水平下，由于品种不同，茎秆高矮不同，抗倒伏的能力也不同。根据梧桐大队品种性状调查：抗倒伏的品种茎秆都比较粗短。如白玉皮茎粗零点三五厘米，茎高一百一十一点二厘米；南大二四一九茎粗零点四一厘米，茎高一零九厘米；辉县红茎粗零点三七厘米，茎高八十四点二厘米；碧蚂一号和四号茎粗零点三五厘米，茎高一百三十四点七厘米。今年倒伏的品种大部为植株较高，茎秆较细的碧蚂一号和四号。如县农场种的南大二四一九，播种二十九斤，施用五十六斤氮；碧蚂四号播种二十五斤，施用四十三斤氮，同时浇了返青、拔节二水，结果南大二四一九没有倒伏，碧蚂四号却全部倒伏。因此，选用良种也是个关键。
    适时播种可以促进冬前分蘖，根系发育良好，幼苗生长健壮，为以后培养粗壮茎秆增强抗倒伏能力创造条件。今年孟县三十万亩小麦大部在寒露前后播种，当时平均气温十六点九度，适宜于小麦发芽和分蘖扎根。因此，一般年前有四至七个分蘖，苗全苗壮。
    据梧桐“八一”农业科学研究所试验结果看，小麦在土壤水分适宜（15％—20％）的情况下，气温在摄氏十五至十七度，或地表皮五公分以下，地温为十五至十八度时，是小麦适宜播种期“寒露”前后，春性强的不宜过早播种，否则容易促使冬前旺长，发生冻害，所以一般应比冬性品种晚播十天到半月。
    根据以上经验，只要在选用秆硬品种、深翻土地、掌握播种期的基础上，每亩播种三十斤左右，有四十到五十万穗，施用三十多斤氮，土壤水分不超过20％，并提早追肥，控制浇水的原则，基本上可以防止小麦倒伏。
