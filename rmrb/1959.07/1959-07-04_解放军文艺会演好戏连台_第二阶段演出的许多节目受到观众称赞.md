The second stage of the People's Liberation Army's Second Art and Literature Festival has been warmly welcomed by audiences.

The multi-act drama "槐树庄" (Huai Shu Village), performed by the Beijing Military Region's Cultural Troupe, profoundly depicts the dramatic changes in China's rural areas and the magnificent momentum of the Great Leap Forward over the past ten years through the growth and changes of a group of ordinary people in "槐树庄" (Huai Shu Village), a village in North China. Many scenes are quite moving. Actress Hu Peng, who played heroic mothers in the films "The White Haired Girl," "Steel Fighter," and "Chrysanthemums in the Deep Mountains," plays the lead role in this drama. Together with other actors, she shaped a group of vivid and lifelike characters, adding to the drama's appeal. The opera "山青水秀" (Green Mountains and Clear Waters) depicts the story of Han Hongzhi, a demobilized soldier, leading the masses to overcome difficulties, climb mountains to find springs, and conquer drought. The opera's music is rich in national characteristics and has been well received. The multi-act drama "山高水长" (High Mountains and Long Rivers), performed by the Wuhan Military Region's Cultural Troupe, depicts the heroic deeds of the local people in the Central Plains Liberated Area in 1946, after our army temporarily withdrew, persisting in arduous struggles under the heavy pressure of the Kuomintang. Some of the characters in this play, such as Wu Yuying and Secretary Dong, are quite memorable.

Many of the songs, dances, and storytelling programs performed by the Beijing and Wuhan Military Region Cultural Troupes are quite good. For example, the four-act ballet "雁翎队" (Wild Goose Platoon), performed by the Beijing Military Region's Cultural Troupe, reflects the scene of the masses in Baiyangdian, Hebei, fighting against the Japanese with small boats during the War of Resistance Against Japan. There are also songs such as "Chairman Mao Shovels Soil, I'll Carry It" and "Singing the Glorious Eight Great Members." The ballet "忆当年" (Remembering the Past), performed by the Wuhan Military Region's Cultural Troupe, has also been well received. This ballet begins when a general visits a painting in the Revolutionary History Museum, which evokes memories. The ballet's images are vivid, its emotions are sincere, and its choreography is rigorous and moving.

The programs performed by the Wuhan Military Region's amateur performance team are novel in content, lively in form, and rich in national style and military characteristics. Programs such as "两张照片" (Two Photos) and "永远乐呵呵" (Always Smiling), sung in the Henan Opera style, the chorus "演习归来" (Returning from Exercise), the dance "为了钢" (For Steel), and the short play "一条红线" (A Red Thread) have all received high praise from the audience.

    解放军文艺会演好戏连台
    第二阶段演出的许多节目受到观众称赞
    本报讯　解放军第二届文艺会演第二阶段的演出，受到了观众的热烈欢迎。
    北京部队文工团演出的多幕话剧“槐树庄”，通过华北某地农村“槐树庄”一群普通人物的成长变化，深刻地勾划出了十年来祖国农村翻天复地的变化和生产大跃进的磅礴气势，有不少场面是相当感人的。曾经在电影“白毛女”、“钢铁战士”和“深山里的菊花”中扮演英雄母亲的演员胡朋，担任了这个剧的主角。她同其它演员一起，塑造了一群有血有肉的人物形象，为这个剧增色不少。歌剧“山青水秀”，是描写复员军人韩宏志带领群众克服困难，登山找泉战胜干旱的事迹。这个歌剧的音乐富有民族特色，受到好评。武汉部队文工团演出的多幕话剧“山高水长”，描写了1946年中原解放区我军暂时撤退后，当地群众在国民党重兵压境的情况下。坚持艰苦斗争的英勇事迹。这个戏里的有些人物，如吴玉莺、董书记等，给人的印象比较深刻。
    北京部队和武汉部队文工团演出的歌舞、说唱节目，有不少是相当好的。如北京部队文工团演出的四幕舞剧：“雁翎队”，反映了抗战时期冀中白洋淀群众驾驶小船同日寇斗争的情景，还有歌唱“毛主席铲土我来担”、“歌唱光荣的八大员”等。武汉部队文工团演出的舞剧“忆当年”，也颇得好评。这个舞剧是通过一位将军在参观革命历史博物馆的一幅油画时，引起回忆，开始了全剧的。舞剧的形象鲜明，情感真挚，编排严谨，颇为动人。
    武汉部队业余演出队演出的节目，内容新颖，形式活泼，富有民族风格和部队特色。像用河南梆子调演唱的“两张照片”、“永远乐呵呵”，合唱“演习归来”，舞蹈“为了钢”，小话剧“一条红线”等节目，都得到观众较高的评价。（附图片）
