    How to Turn Weak Seedlings into Strong Seedlings
    To transform weak seedlings into strong ones, the first step is to analyze the situation, and then prescribe the right remedy. If the seedlings are short, have few leaves, yellowing leaves with dry tips, uneven growth, and show signs of premature aging, it signifies a lack of fertilizer. For such seedlings, immediately apply nitrogen and potassium fertilizers. When fertilizing, apply nitrogen fertilizer first, followed by potassium fertilizer. Per mu, use five to ten jin of ammonium sulfate, diluting each jin with one hundred fifty to two hundred jin of water, or use well-decomposed human urine and manure, diluted one to two times, and apply once or twice within a week. The amount should not be excessive. After the seedlings turn green, apply ash fertilizer once more to promote strong and healthy growth. While applying fertilizer, also manage irrigation and drainage properly. According to experiments by agricultural science research institutions, if the field is over-irrigated, drain the water before applying fertilizer to allow the seedlings to receive sufficient nutrients and a well-ventilated environment, promoting growth. If it is dryland nursery, water the ground before applying fertilizer to moisten it. (Huang Fangchang)

    怎样使弱秧变壮秧
    要使弱秧变成壮秧，首先要研究情况，然后对症下药。如果秧苗植株矮小，叶片少，叶黄尾干，生长不均匀，有未老先衰的现象，这就是缺少肥料的象征。对这类秧苗，要立即追施氮、钾两种肥料。施肥时，先施氮肥，后施钾肥。每亩可用五斤至十斤硫酸铵，每斤兑水一百五十斤至二百斤，或用腐熟人尿和粪水，稀释一至二倍，在一星期内追施一至二次。施量不宜过多，秧苗转青后，再施一次灰肥，以促进秧苗壮健。在追肥的同时，还要抓住合理排灌。据农业科学研究机关试验，如果田间灌水过深，应排干水再追肥，使秧苗得到充分的肥分和通风透气的环境，促进生长。如果是旱地育秧，应施肥前灌水使地面湿润。　（黄方昌）
