　　The well-known Sichuan cuisine, with its unique richness and abundance, is unforgettable; however, Sichuan's pickled vegetables have a distinct flavor: a small dish of broad bean sauce, a few pieces of pickled radish, or a bowl of pickled salted vegetables, can also make people eat with relish.

　　The pickles of Sichuan are most famous in Chengdu. Here, almost every street and alley has a pickle shop. A piece of spicy fermented bean curd costs only three cents, and a bowl of salted pickled vegetables can be bought for two cents. In a family of five, spending a few cents or a dime can provide a suitable side dish for a meal.

　　Recently, I visited the Chengdu United Brewing Factory, a factory specializing in the production of fermented bean curd and pickled vegetables. Its products are famous far and wide. When I went there, they were processing Chinese cabbage fermented bean curd. As soon as I entered the workshop, I saw female workers in spotless white uniforms skillfully wrapping salt-cured Chinese cabbage around bean curd, then mixing it with dry chili peppers, broad bean sauce, Sichuan peppercorns, and other spices, and putting it into jars to ferment and mature. The workers told me that the factory's current production of fermented bean curd has increased by nearly half compared to the same period last year, but it still cannot meet market demand. Recently, the workers have been trying to tap production potential and improve the soybean pulp yield by grinding finely and slowly. In the past, each pound of soybeans could only produce 23 pieces of fermented bean curd, but now it has increased to 30 pieces. This measure alone can increase the annual production by more than 50,000 jin of fermented bean curd.

　　In various brewing factories, there are experienced master craftsmen personally operating the production. In the Chengdu United Brewing Factory, the pickled vegetables made by master craftsman Pan Deming have the advantages of being tender, crisp, fresh, fragrant, and long-lasting without deterioration. When I saw him, he was enthusiastically teaching young workers how to drain the freshly pickled vegetables. He said, "I have been making pickled vegetables for decades, and I have never been as busy as this year. Many old methods are no longer sufficient." Recently, he and the workers have been making great efforts in technical innovation, establishing a technical research group in the workshop, and combining ancient traditional methods with advanced technologies. They have implemented mechanization and semi-mechanization in some processes such as cutting vegetables and mixing spices, and have established new-style drying rooms, adopting advanced technologies such as salt-free fermentation to shorten the production process. In the past, the fermented bean curd from this factory had to wait at least eight months to mature after being put into jars; now, it can be placed in the drying room for artificial fermentation and supplied to the market after four months, and the quality is as good as natural fermentation.

　　The workers in Chengdu's pickle brewing factories not only produce various traditional famous products, but also strive to expand new varieties. Today, Chengdu produces more than 100 kinds of pickled vegetables. Among them, in addition to the original pickled Tianjin preserved vegetable, pickled kohlrabi, five-spice dried radish, pickled cucumber, and pickled small green peppers, the recently pickled wax gourd, lettuce, garlic sprouts, and string beans have also been successful. Not long ago, they went to other places to visit and study, and brought back the skills of making eight-treasure pickled vegetables and assorted pickles, making Chengdu's pickled vegetables even more rich and colorful.

　　This year, Chengdu's famous pickles will not only increase production by about double compared to last year, but also add more new varieties to meet the needs of people's lives.

    锦城的酱菜
    脍炙人口的川菜，以它独有的浓馥、丰富，使人难以忘怀；但是，四川的酱菜更别具风味：一碟豆瓣酱、几块泡萝卜，或者一碗腌盐菜，也令人吃得津津有味。
    四川的小菜以成都最有名。在这里，几乎每条街巷，都有酱园铺。一块香辣豆酱乳只要三分钱，一碗盐泡菜二分钱就可买到。在一个五口之家的家庭，化上几分钱角把钱，就有一顿适口的佐餐菜。
    最近我访问了成都联合酿造厂，这是一家专门生产豆腐乳和酱腌菜的工厂。它的产品远近驰名。我去时，这里正在加工白菜豆腐乳。一走进车间，就看到穿着洁白服装的女工，熟练地把用盐腌过的白菜包在豆腐坯上，然后拌上干海椒、豆瓣、花椒等香料，装入坛内让它发酵成熟。工人们告诉我，这个车间目前生产的豆腐乳，比去年同期增加近一半，但仍不能满足市场供应。最近，工人们想法挖掘生产潜力，用细磨、慢磨的办法，提高了黄豆的出浆率。过去每斤黄豆只能制二十三块豆腐乳，现在提高到三十块。仅这一措施，一年就可以增产五万多斤豆腐乳。
    在各个酿造厂里，都有一些具有多年生产经验的老师傅亲自操作。在成都联合酿造厂。潘德明老师傅作的酱菜，便具有嫩、脆、鲜、香、久藏不变的优点。我看见他时，他正在热心地教导年青工人，把刚腌渍过的鲜菜进行排水。他说，我作了几十年酱腌菜，从来没有像今年这样繁忙过，许多老办法已经不够用了。最近，他和工人们一起大闹技术革新，在车间里成立了技术研究小组，把古老的传统作法和先进技术结合起来。他们在切菜，拌香料等部分工序中实行机械化和半机械化，并建立了新式烘房，采用无盐发酵等先进技术，缩短生产过程。过去这个厂的豆腐乳，装坛以后至少要等八个月才成熟；现在放在烘房里用人工发酵，四个月后就能供应市场，并且质量和自然发酵的一样好。
    成都的酱腌酿造厂工人，不仅生产各种传统的名产品，还竭力扩大新品种。今天，成都生产的酱腌菜已不下一百多种。其中，除了原有的酱冬菜、酱大头菜、五香萝卜干、酱黄瓜、酱小青椒外，最近酱腌笋瓜、窝笋、蒜台、江豆也获得成功。不久以前，他们到外地参观学习，又带回了制作八宝酱菜、什锦咸菜的手艺，使成都的酱菜更加丰富多彩。
    今年成都的著名小菜除了产量比去年增加一倍左右，还要增加更多的新品种，以供应人民生活需要。
