　　Increase Production of Fertilizers and Pesticides to Support Agricultural Production
　　Anqing Prefecture's Three Newly Built Calcium-Magnesium Phosphate Fertilizer Plants Partially Put into Production
　　Guangzhou Yuan Yulong Chemical Plant Strives to Increase Pesticide Production by 26% in the Third Quarter

　　(Our Newspaper News) The three newly built calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer plants in Anqing Prefecture have recently begun partial production.

　　These three plants have a total of ten blast furnaces. In addition to the six blast furnaces with an annual output of more than 1,000 tons of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer that have already been put into production, the remaining four 10,000-ton-level blast furnaces will be completed in July this year. It is estimated that 20,000 tons of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer can be produced this year, and 50,000 tons can be produced annually thereafter. Calculated on the basis of an average of 6.42 million mu of cultivated land in the entire prefecture, this amounts to more than 15 jin per mu.

　　The construction of these three calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer plants is of great significance to agricultural production in Anqing Prefecture. Since the Great Leap Forward, rational close planting has been universally promoted in various places, and the demand for fertilizer for various crops has greatly increased, especially the demand for phosphate fertilizer. In many places, the stalks of crops grow very strongly, and the ears are also very large, but often there are many shriveled grains due to insufficient phosphate fertilizer, which affects the harvest. The construction of these three calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer plants will greatly change this situation. Calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer can make crops cold-resistant and early-maturing, and shorten the growth period, which will be of great help in ensuring a bumper harvest of double-cropping rice, which requires almost the entire frost-free period. In addition, the large-scale production and use of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer can also free up a large amount of labor from the manure accumulation front for other production.

　　The leadership departments of Anhui Province and Anqing Prefecture attach great importance to the construction of these three calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer plants, allocating steel and mechanical equipment to ensure their launch. Among the various equipment, there are as many as seventeen power equipment such as generators, motors, gas engines, and boiler-towing machines, and a large amount of magnesite is transported from the Northeast as the lining material for the furnaces. The Anqing Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred a group of cadres and workers to participate in the preparatory work. Comrade Shi Junjie, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Prefectural Committee, and other responsible comrades also went to the construction site many times to provide specific guidance. In order to produce fertilizer quickly and early, and to support the peasant brothers in producing more grain, the construction workers were even more enthusiastic. In the spirit of self-reliance and no waiting, they tried every means to overcome difficulties and implemented three shifts of construction day and night, which greatly accelerated the construction speed of the plant.

　　(Our Newspaper News) Workers of the Qinghai Province Chaerhan Potash Fertilizer Plant have taken active measures to increase production.

　　At present, in the Chaerhan Potash Fertilizer Plant, from leading cadres to production workers, they are all busy producing more potash fertilizer and transporting the potash fertilizer that has been produced in a timely manner. Every day, many cars come here to load potash fertilizer, some of which are transported to various parts of the province, and some are transported from Chaerhan to Xiadong Railway Station in Gansu Province, and then transferred to Guangxi, Jilin, Guizhou, Tianjin and other places. According to statistics: this year, a total of 764 tons of potash fertilizer have been transported from this factory to various provinces.

　　Since the beginning of this year, in order to support the continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, the Party Committee of the Potash Fertilizer Plant explained to the workers that grain production is the primary task of the whole Party and the whole people in Qinghai Province this year, and mobilized all workers to try every means to increase potash fertilizer production to support agricultural production. The workers of the Potash Fertilizer Plant responded to the call of the Party Committee and enthusiastically devoted themselves to production. Qiao Siyi, Secretary of the Plant Party Committee, Zhang Fuji, Deputy Director, Feng Guowang, Director of the Office of the Provincial Chemical Industry Bureau who helped work in the plant, and responsible cadres of various production teams, all went deep into the construction site to participate in production and lead production, so the production volume continued to increase. In order to transport the potash fertilizer that has been produced in a timely manner, the administrative cadres of the plant's sections and some workers actively participated in packaging. On May 24 alone, they packaged more than 200 tons of potash fertilizer in two hours.

　　According to Guangzhou Daily News, Guangzhou Yuan Yulong Chemical Plant, in carrying out the campaign to increase production and save resources centered on strengthening enterprise management, decided to increase production by 26% in the third quarter on the basis of a 29.2% increase in the second quarter to support agricultural production.

　　The main products of this factory are pesticides such as "666" and "Xilisheng". In the past, there was a period of time when the quality and safety were not paid enough attention to because of the one-sided pursuit of output, and the quality seriously declined.

　　The Party and government leading cadres of this factory went deep into production and used the method of dissecting sparrows to find the reasons and improve product quality. First of all, the laboratory was designated to grasp the quality inspection system. The laboratory personnel also changed the past practice of sitting in the laboratory waiting for sample testing, and went deep into the workshop to extract samples for testing, participated in the workshop production meeting, listened to the workers' opinions, observed the workers' operations, and immediately told the workshop the test results. A system of reporting the test situation to the Party Committee on a regular basis and checking on time was also stipulated. At the same time, the leadership also convened a special meeting of cadres, technicians and workers to study quality, analyze the reasons, adopt suggestions, and make decisions. Conscientiously solve the problems existing in rules and regulations and technology. At present, the pass rate has reached 100%.

　　On the basis of ensuring high quality, this factory further realized that after this year's extraordinary flood, pests may increase, and proposed measures to increase production. The factory overfulfilled the production task of "666" powder by 29.2% in the second quarter; the third quarter will increase production by another 26% compared with the second quarter. This will play a certain role in supporting agricultural production and promoting bumper harvests. (Attached picture)

    多产化肥农药　支援农业生产
    安庆专区新建三座钙镁磷肥厂部分投入生产
    广州源裕隆化工厂争取三季度增产农药26％
    本报讯　安庆专区新建的三座钙镁磷肥厂最近开始部分投入生产。
    这三个厂共拥有十座高炉，除目前已投入生产的六个年产一千多吨钙镁磷肥的高炉以外，其余四个万吨级高炉将在今年7月间建成，预计今年可以生产钙镁磷肥二万吨，以后每年可以生产五万吨，按全专区六百四十二万亩耕地面积平均计算，每亩合十五斤多。
    这三座钙镁磷肥厂的建设，对安庆专区农业生产具有重大意义。自从大跃进以来，各地普遍推行了合理密植，各种农作物对肥料的需要量大增，特别是对磷肥需要更为迫切，许多地方庄稼秸秆长得非常茁壮，穗头也很大，但往往因为磷肥不足而有很多瘪籽，影响了收成。这三个钙镁磷肥厂的建设，将可以大大改变这种情况。钙镁磷肥能使庄稼耐寒早熟，缩短生长期，这对于保证几乎需要占用全部无霜期的双季稻的丰收，将有很大作用。此外，钙镁磷肥的大量生产和使用，还可以使农民从积肥战线上腾出大量劳动力投入其他生产。
    安徽省及安庆专区领导部门对这三座钙镁磷肥厂的建设十分重视，拨出钢材和机械设备保证其上马，在各种设备中，仅发电机、电动机、煤气机、锅驼机等动力设备就有十七部，同时从东北运来大批镁砂作为炉衬的材料。中共安庆地委抽调一批干部和工人参加筹建工作。地委书记处书记史俊杰等负责同志也多次到工地具体指导。建厂工人为了快出肥，早出肥，支援农民兄弟多打粮食，更是干劲冲天，他们本着自力更生、决不等待的精神，千方百计克服困难，实行日夜三班施工，大大加快了建厂速度。
    本报讯　青海省察尔汉钾肥厂职工，采取积极措施，增加生产。
    目前，在察尔汉钾肥厂里，从领导干部到生产工人，都为多产钾肥并为把已生产的钾肥及时运出去而忙碌着。每天，有不少汽车来这里装运钾肥，一部分运往省内各地，有一部分从察尔汉运到甘肃省峡东火车站，再转运到广西、吉林、贵州、天津等地。根据统计：今年从这个厂运到省内和省外的钾肥共达七百六十四吨。
    今年以来，为了支援农业生产继续大跃进，钾肥厂党委向职工讲解了粮食生产是今年青海省全党全民的首要任务，动员全体职工，千方百计，提高钾肥产量，支援农业生产。钾肥厂的职工，响应了党委的号召，满怀热情地投入了生产，厂党委书记乔思义、副厂长张富士和在厂帮助工作的省化学工业局办公室主任冯国旺以及各生产队的负责干部，都深入工地，参加生产，领导生产，因而，生产量不断提高。为了把已经生产的钾肥及时运出去，厂内科室管理干部和一部分工人，积极参加包装，仅在5月24日的两个小时内，就包装好二百多吨钾肥。
    据广州日报消息　广州市源裕隆化工厂，在开展以加强企业管理为中心的增产节约运动中，决定在二季增产29.2％的基础上，第三季度再增产26％，支援农业生产。
    这个厂主要产品是“六六六”、“西力生”等农药。过去，曾有一段时期因为片面追求产量，对质量和安全不够重视，质量严重下降。
    这个厂的党政领导干部深入生产，用解剖麻雀的方法来找原因，提高产品质量。首先，指定化验室把质量检验制度抓起来。化验人员也改变了过去坐在化验室等样本化验的作法，深入车间抽取样本化验，参加车间生产会议，听取工人意见，观察工人操作，并把化验结果，立刻告诉车间。并规定了按期将化验情况报告党委、按时检查的制度。同时，领导上又召开了干部、技术人员和工人研究质量的专题会议，分析原因，采纳建议，作出决定。认真解决规章制度和技术上存在的问题。目前，正品率已达到百分之百。
    这个厂在保证优质的基础上，更进一步认识到，今年特大洪水过后，虫害可能增加，又提出增加生产的措施，第二季全厂超额完成了“六六六”粉生产任务29.2％；第三季将比第二季再增产26％。这样对支援农业生产，促进丰收将起一定的作用。（附图片）
