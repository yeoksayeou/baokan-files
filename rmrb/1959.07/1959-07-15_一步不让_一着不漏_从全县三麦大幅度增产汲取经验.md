Not Yielding an Inch, Not Missing a Single Step
    ——Drawing Experience from the Substantial Increase in Production of Three Wheats in the Entire County
    Zhu Weizhong, First Secretary of the CPC Yangzhong County Committee, Jiangsu

    The 200,000 people of Yangzhong County, located in the center of the Yangtze River, have, after a winter and spring of hard work, reaped the bountiful fruit of a comprehensive bumper harvest of three wheats (barley, naked barley, wheat). This year's bumper harvest of three wheats has two characteristics. First, not only did the yield per unit area increase substantially, but also the total output increased significantly due to multiple planting and high yields. The total output of three wheats increased from 22.17 million jin in 1958 to 42.96 million jin, an increase of 93.77%; the yield per unit area of more than 100,000 mu of wheat fields (excluding intercropping and sporadic land yields) increased from 198 jin in 1958 to 362 jin, an increase of 82.9%. Second, all regions in the county have achieved relatively balanced and substantial increases in production. Taking the high-yield Happiness Commune and the low-yield Fengyu Commune as examples, the yield per unit area of the Happiness Commune increased from 283 jin in 1958 to 380 jin; the Fengyu Commune increased from 155 jin to 315 jin. Of the county's more than 100,000 mu of wheat fields, 68% had a yield of 300 to 400 jin per mu, 11.5% had a yield of 400 to 500 jin, 9.9% had a yield of more than 500 jin, and less than 300 jin per mu accounted for only 10.6% of the total area.
    Now, the three wheats have all been threshed and stored in warehouses. Due to the large increase in the three wheats, more than 95% of the commune members in the county have increased their income, the rations distributed to commune members have increased compared with the same period last year, and the amount of three wheats sold to the state has also increased from 2.06 million jin last year to 10.17 million jin, overfulfilling the grain sales plan.
                            ＊＊＊
    Why was it possible to achieve such a substantial increase in the production of three wheats this year? According to our experience, the factors that contributed to the increased production of three wheats are multifaceted; we both grasped the implementation of various technical measures for intensive cultivation and careful farming, and grasped farmland capital construction to create favorable conditions for increased production; we both strived for an increase in unit yield; and did everything possible to ensure that the planting area was not reduced but expanded, reliably guaranteeing the growth of total output; in the entire process of leading the production of three wheats, from planting to harvesting, we tried our best to "start from the beginning, link every link closely, not yield an inch, not miss a single step," so that the three wheats could successfully pass through each "hurdle" and grow vigorously.
      Reasonably arrange crop layout, fully tap
        land potential, and achieve multiple planting, high yield and multiple harvest
    When sowing in autumn last year, we first encountered the issue of summer crop layout. For this issue, we have two basic guiding ideologies: one is to ensure the growth of both unit yield and total output of three wheats, and at the same time strive for increased green manure production, in order to increase the base fertilizer for autumn crops. The other is that Yangzhong has a large population and little land, with an average of only eight fen of paddy field and one fen of upland per person, so we must rationally arrange the crop layout, further fully utilize all arable land, and tap the potential of the land to achieve multiple planting, high yield, and multiple harvest.
    In this regard, we have taken the following measures:
    First, change from intercropping grass (green manure) and wheat to separate planting of grass and wheat. In 1958, there were only more than 30,000 mu of single-cropped wheat fields here, and the other nearly 130,000 mu were intercropped with grass and wheat. This year, more than 104,000 mu were planted with three wheats, and more than 60,000 mu were planted with green manure. In this way, the planting area of green manure was expanded by more than 6,000 mu, and the planting area of three wheats was reduced by more than 6,000 mu (calculated by intercropping grass and wheat one mu equals six fen of single-cropped wheat field), but because of separate planting, it is convenient for careful processing and management, and to increase the yield per unit area.
    Second, fully utilize scattered land to expand the planting of three wheats. We utilized all scattered wasteland on high land and "ten edges" such as field edges, river edges, house edges, and road edges that were not planted with vegetables and fodder, as well as vacant land prepared for water conservancy projects that had not yet started construction, to expand the planting of more than 7,000 mu of wheat, achieving "every inch of land must be contested" and not wasting a piece of land.
    Third, after sowing, we saw that the growth of some green manure fields was not good, and immediately seized the time to spot-sow more than 20,000 mu of wheat in the green manure fields.
    Some comrades had some resistance to the county party committee's policy of multiple planting, high yield, and multiple harvest. Some people were satisfied with the estimated increase in production of more than 100,000 mu of large fields, and were not active enough in striving for extensive planting and multiple harvest. We criticized this idea, emphasizing that the increase in the total output of three wheats must be established on a more practical and reliable basis, and there must be room for maneuver. We had no experience in how much the total output of three wheats would exceed last year after changing the intercropping of grass and wheat, so we must not ignore the simultaneous implementation of extensive planting and multiple harvest, and expand the planting area of three wheats by all possible means.
    Some people believed that planting wheat everywhere in a scattered manner on high land, ten edges, and scattered wasteland in water conservancy construction sites was not formal, not good-looking, and did not meet the "standard." We opposed this view. Yangzhong has so little arable land, and the food problem has not yet been solved. At present, every inch of land is worth its weight in gold. It is good to seize a little more grain by all possible means. We must not leave this big premise to talk about so-called "formality" and "standard."
    Some people are more enthusiastic about calculating the yield per unit area, and not very enthusiastic about calculating the total output. They are afraid that expanding the planting of scattered vacant land will reduce the average yield per unit area. Therefore, we especially emphasized that the increase in grain production should be concentrated on the increase in total output. Improving the unit yield of large fields is an important aspect of increasing total output, and extensively planting scattered vacant land, accumulating small amounts, can also effectively increase total output.
    Now, the results of practice have proved that this approach is correct. The planting area of three wheats is not less than last year, but more than last year. More than 5 million jin of wheat were harvested from the expansion of planting wheat in green manure intercropping and high land and ten edges scattered vacant land, accounting for more than 12% of the total output of three wheats. More than 60,000 mu of green manure, including more than 20,000 mu of green manure spot-sowed with wheat, have all achieved a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 5,000 jin per mu, which is also 66% higher than last year.
      Grasp agricultural capital construction in line with local conditions,
          Further transform the production conditions of three wheats
    This year's victory in the three wheats is inseparable from the achievements of agricultural capital construction.
    From the objective conditions of Yangzhong, it is surrounded by rivers on all sides, and most of the land is relatively fertile; there is sufficient water, and it is generally not afraid of drought; there is little land and a large population, which is conducive to intensive cultivation and careful farming. These are the favorable aspects of striving for increased production of three wheats. However, the terrain is low-lying, and the river water level often exceeds the ground level by one meter, so the groundwater level is very high, and stagnant water is not easy to drain, and it often suffers from serious waterlogging; there are more than 30,000 mu of leaking sand fields, and the soil quality is very poor. These are the unfavorable aspects of striving for increased production of three wheats. Therefore, carrying out agricultural capital construction, especially farmland water conservancy construction, is a key to ensuring increased production of three wheats.
      Before autumn sowing last year, we specifically analyzed the impact of agricultural capital construction on the production conditions of three wheats in Yangzhong in recent years. Since the winter of 1955, we have grasped farmland water conservancy every year, and initially renovated the river embankments and various rivers, built dozens of culverts, and greatly reduced flood and waterlogging disasters; more than 20,000 mu of the more than 30,000 mu of leaking sand fields have been transformed; pig raising and green manure have also developed. Therefore, the yield of three wheats has also changed significantly. Before 1955, the average yield per unit area was only about 50 to 100 jin, and from 1956 to 1958, the average yield per unit area increased to about 150 to 200 jin. However, flood and waterlogging disasters have not been fundamentally eliminated, especially the waterlogging in the 50,000 mu of low-lying land is still very serious. In the bumper harvest year of 1958, the yield of three wheats per mu in these low-lying areas was only about 100 jin. Obviously, without further grasping capital construction, it would be impossible to further transform production conditions, and various technical measures for intensive cultivation and careful farming would be greatly restricted, and it would be difficult to have a reliable guarantee for striving for a large-scale and substantial increase in production throughout the county.
    According to the situation in Yangzhong, our guiding ideology in capital construction is: 1. Take water conservancy as the lead, and at the same time grasp the capital construction of fertilizers. In one winter and one spring, we opened up more than 500 port channels, did more than 5.8 million cubic meters of earthwork; all wheat fields have built field drainage systems, achieving "ditches connected to rivers, rivers connected to ports, and ports connected to rivers", further controlling the entry and exit of river water and lowering the groundwater level; at the same time, continue to expand the planting of green manure and raise more than 100,000 pigs (an average of 0.7 pigs per mu of land), and the county, commune, and team have established a number of native fertilizer plants. 2. Concentrate superior forces and "eat" in blocks. We estimated that Yangzhong has sufficient manpower, water conservancy construction has a foundation, and after communization, it is entirely possible to "eat" the 50,000 mu of low-lying land. Therefore, last year, we vigorously opened ports and built sluices in the low-lying areas, opened drainage channels, and added 20 pumping units to eliminate waterlogging in the low-lying areas.
    Regarding the policy of capital construction, such as the policy of water management, there have been disputes. Starting from the objective situation of Yangzhong, which has abundant water sources, low-lying terrain, and is afraid of waterlogging but not afraid of drought, we insisted that water management should focus on drainage; according to the actual situation of Yangzhong, which has very little cultivated land and a network of old river courses, we insisted on fully utilizing the old river courses and minimizing the digging or less digging of cultivated land. This policy seems to be correct. According to this policy of water management, it has achieved initial results. However, last winter, some comrades in our county wanted to mechanically apply the experience of "river network" construction in other places, to focus on irrigation, and the construction of river courses and both sides should also meet high standards, so it is necessary to open up new river courses and fill in old river courses. If this approach is followed, the county needs to fill in about 75% of the old river courses, and dig more than 17,000 mu, accounting for about 10% of the county's cultivated land. This is obviously not appropriate, and we cannot agree with the practices of these comrades. From this debate on the water management policy, we have more deeply realized that when carrying out agricultural capital construction, we must carefully investigate and study, specifically analyze the objective conditions, and adhere to the principle of adapting to local conditions and times.
    Looking back now, it is correct for us to grasp capital construction in this way. In particular, if we do not concentrate our efforts to "eat" the water conservancy project of 50,000 mu of low-lying land, then these 50,000 mu of land will not be able to jump from about 100 jin per mu last year to about 300 jin per mu. However, capital construction work is far from being able to meet the needs of continuing to strive for large-scale high yields, water conservancy needs to be continued, and the lack of fertilizer is always a big difficulty. This year, some wheat fields in remote fields and remote areas have affected the yield due to lack of fertilizer. Therefore, in the future, we must raise the capital construction work of fertilizer to a more important position.
      Implement intensive cultivation and careful farming, so that the favorable conditions created by capital construction
        Fully exert the effect of increasing production
    To make the favorable conditions created by capital construction work fully exert its effect of increasing production, and to make the land fully exert its potential, we must implement intensive cultivation and careful farming, and promote various advanced technical measures.
    Although Yangzhong has a large population and little land, the cultivation of three wheats in the past was very extensive. This is because: 1. The three wheats often suffer from waterlogging and reduced production, and the masses value rice and underestimate three wheats. Until 1956, due to vigorous construction of farmland water conservancy, it gradually changed; 2. Before liberation, more than 50,000 laborers went to various places, and only about 30,000 people returned one after another after 1956. Now, the county has about 70,000 laborers, of which women account for about two-thirds. At present, emphasizing changing the extensive cultivation phenomenon and implementing intensive cultivation and careful farming is not only necessary, but also has relatively good conditions.
    What are the differences between this year's three wheat cultivation and the past?
    First, the wheat fields were all deeply ploughed to about five or six inches to one foot before sowing. Before 1955, the wheat fields here were sown without ploughing. After 1956, only part of the land was ploughed before sowing.
    Second, the wheat ridge was enlarged and the wasteland was reduced. The wheat ridge was expanded from four feet to eight feet, and the wasteland was reduced from six inches to four inches, increasing the utilization rate of the land.
    Third, close planting was promoted. More than 20,000 mu in the county had excessive sowing volume and the wheat seedlings were too dense; other sowings were about 25 jin to 35 jin, which was more reasonable.
    Fourth, good varieties were adopted. It has been done to universally adopt the "Yangzhong Red" and "2419", "Dwarf Grain More" good varieties, and after wind, sieve, grain, salt selection and drug seed mixing.
    Fifth, more fertilizer was applied. This year, an average of about 100 loads of fine fertilizer per mu was applied as base fertilizer, and topdressing was generally four or five times, the most up to ten times, and the least three times, an average of two more times than last year. The amount of base fertilizer and topdressing has doubled compared with last year, and we generally pay attention to "looking at the field, looking at the seedlings, and looking at the time" to apply fertilizer reasonably. For example, in the round stem jointing stage, in order to promote the wheat seedlings to be thick and hard, and the ears to be large and the grains to be many, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are applied to the first and second-class seedlings, and nitrogen fertilizer is applied to the third-class seedlings first, and then phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are applied to make them catch up with the first and second-class seedlings.
    Sixth, drainage channels were universally opened in the wheat fields. The channel is one foot to one and a half feet deep, accelerating the discharge of stagnant water and lowering the groundwater level.
    Seventh, it is common to loosen the ridge and cover the soil, and some also laid grass and established field soil fumigation kilns to protect the wheat seedlings through the winter. Before 1955, it was generally not loosened the ridge and covered the soil. After 1956, only part of the wheat fields loosened the ridge and covered the soil, so that some wheat seedlings were damaged by freezing and reduced production.
    Eighth, wheat field cultivation and weeding generally reached four or five times, while in the past it was generally only weeded twice.
    In short, under the slogan of "cultivation is gardening, and wheat management is like embroidery", we actively promoted various advanced technical measures, and intensive cultivation and careful farming have indeed made great progress compared with the past.
    Why were we able to better promote various production increase measures and implement intensive cultivation and careful farming this year? From the perspective of the Party committee's leadership work, the main experiences are four: First, grasping leadership from beginning to end, our slogan is: "Start from the beginning, link every link closely, do not yield an inch, do not miss a single step"; Second, consult with the masses on everything, our slogan is: "Seek teachers and visit friends, seek advice and ask for plans"; Third, cadres take the lead, everything is tested, our slogan is: "Everyone has a pilot, everything has a model"; Fourth, cadres learn technology, our slogan is: "Learning science" and "Taking old farmers as teachers". If these four points are done well and combined well, we can not only grasp the leadership, but also avoid making the mistake of coercion and command; we can not only implement the mass line, but also avoid letting things go. Some of the loopholes that appeared in this year's three wheat production are caused by the fact that we have not learned technology well.
    We must grasp it early and grasp it tightly. In addition to grasping the agricultural season, planting area, deep ploughing and sowing quality from the beginning of autumn sowing last year, one and a half months before autumn sowing, the county launched a mass movement to vigorously engage in wheat field base fertilizer accumulation. In the process of three wheat management, we prepared ten to half a month in advance for each "pass" such as overwintering, returning green, jointing, heading, preventing lodging, and preventing pests and diseases, proposed measures, and quickly implemented them. For example, in order to promote the three wheats to return green, jointing, and heading, the county carried out water manure pond in advance, accumulated 5.57 million jin of snail fertilizer (containing potassium, phosphorus, nitrogen and other components), and more than 130 million jin of various native fertilizers (using fumigated soil, mussel shells, etc. as raw materials), thereby ensuring the need for timely topdressing of the vast majority of wheat fields. When encountering disasters, the leadership must be decisive and quickly take firm measures. In February, when it was raining continuously, and in March, when the groundwater level rose, we resolutely organized more than 50,000 people each time, and invested in the battle to rush to drain stagnant water and lower the groundwater level day and night, ensuring that the crops would not be reduced due to waterlogging. In late March, the county began to find that more than 9,300 mu of wheat fields had varying degrees of lodging. Some complaints arose among the masses, believing that "close planting was bad". We immediately made a decisive decision and unswervingly implemented four measures: First, implement thinning seedlings to remove thin branches and keep strong stalks; Second, change broadcast sowing to strip sowing to ventilate and light; Third, vigorously apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizers; Fourth, sprinkle grass ash water, so that these fields can be saved, and the yield per mu is still about 300 to 400 jin.
    However, grasping the leadership must implement the mass line and learn to consult with the masses on everything. For each "pass" in the three wheat management this year, we held symposiums with old farmers and technicians to seek advice from the masses. For example, spot-sowing wheat in some poorly growing green manure fields was done after studying with old farmers and technicians. Another example is the measures to vigorously engage in snail fertilizer to help solve the difficulty of insufficient topdressing, and to take measures such as sprinkling grass ash water to prevent lodging and rescue lodged wheat seedlings, which were all proposed by experienced old farmers and technicians at the symposium, tested, made a model, and promoted in a timely manner.
    In order to correctly strengthen the leadership of production technology, it is increasingly important for cadres to learn technology. Cadres at all levels from the county party committee, commune party committee to the management area all took old farmers as teachers. My own teacher is labor model Huang Meishan. Since last winter, I have visited him no less than ten times and learned a lot of experience from him on weeding, fertilizing, and preventing lodging. We also insisted on and developed the experience of running "experimental fields". Cadres and masses throughout the county combined to plant more than 10,000 mu of experimental fields and conducted various experiments on different production technologies. Many cadres also closely combined with production to study books on agricultural knowledge. In this way, it is greatly conducive to the implementation of various technical measures. We deeply realized that the leadership of production is becoming more and more specific and meticulous. If we do not grasp learning technology and do not achieve both red and expert, we will inevitably fall behind the development of the situation. Some of the loopholes that appeared in the three wheat production this year were caused by the fact that we have not yet learned technology well.
      Effectively improve working methods and work style,
      Make the mass movement vigorous and down-to-earth
    The process of leading the large-scale increase in the production of three wheats is the process of engaging in mass movements. Our experience shows that only by engaging in mass movements can everyone exert their soaring drive, effectively implement production increase measures, and actively create conditions for production increase.
    In engaging in mass movements, we accepted some good working methods from last year, and also groped for some new working methods.
    We must make the idea of the Great Leap Forward take root in the masses. Before autumn sowing, the county and commune convened mass meetings and small symposiums to summarize the experience of the bumper harvest in 1958 and discuss the planning for the summer harvest production increase in 1959. The masses put forward more than 20,000 opinions. Various communes also widely adopted methods such as exhibitions, blackboards, and propaganda signs to form a high political atmosphere of striving for a large increase in the production of three wheats with a thousand jin of drive and a thousand jin of measures. With the development of the three wheat production increase movement, the masses' emotions were happy with victory and fluctuated with difficulties. Whenever we encountered difficulties and implemented major advanced technical measures, we organized a nationwide discussion to analyze the conditions, find solutions, and strengthen the idea of the Great Leap Forward. Due to grasping these tasks, especially after the People's Commune was rectified, the management and implementation of the principle of distribution according to work were further improved, which continuously improved the enthusiasm of the masses and promoted the production upsurge wave after wave.
    Carry out red flag competitions, organize inspections and evaluations, and consistently permeate the entire process of three wheat production. On the one hand, competitions were carried out with commune against commune, team against team, and person against person, according to season and agricultural work; large-scale mass inspections and evaluations were organized once in each production stage in the county, and once a month in the commune, thereby often creating a hot atmosphere of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced. On the other hand, we also especially emphasized that leading cadres at all levels should often conduct "small inspections" to truly discover and solve problems. Therefore, this year's red flag competition and inspection and evaluation work have made significant progress compared with last year, mainly reflected in: First, past inspections were mostly run by local cadres, and what they saw was the central area; now they are taking local cadres to go, not only looking at the central area, but also looking at the remote area, which helps local cadres overcome the weakness of neglecting the work in the remote area. Second, past inspections generally only paid attention to praising and promoting the experience of advanced communes. Now we propose "in advanced communes, we should pay attention to finding weaknesses, and in backward communes, we should pay attention to boosting morale", helping "backward" communes create some good experiences, and spur advanced communes to prevent complacency and continue to move forward. Since the beginning of this year, we have held four on-site meetings in the Fengyu Commune, which was originally lagging behind in work, greatly mobilizing their enthusiasm and that of other "backward" communes.
    To carry out the mass movement and persist in a down-to-earth manner, we must earnestly improve the thinking style of cadres. As soon as autumn sowing ended, we resolutely established a responsibility system at all levels, implementing the system of county party committee secretaries in charge of the region, county party committee members in charge of communes, commune cadres in charge of management areas, management area cadres in charge of production teams, production team cadres in charge of the dike, and commune members in charge of the field. Various departments of the county party committee also went to the commune to work, grasped the base points, linked with reality, and guided the overall situation. After the rectification of the commune, cadres at all levels further implemented "labor in fixed locations, and leadership in designated areas". In this way, the leadership of the mass movement to increase the production of three wheats is more in-depth and meticulous. Experience has proved that where the thinking style of cadres is not good, there will be no real mass movement. Fengyu Commune is a relatively typical example. Many cadres here used to have a very floating style, often wearing shoes and socks and not participating in production, so that the enthusiasm of the masses could not be well mobilized. We earnestly urged them to truly change their style, starting with the determination to take off their shoes and socks and carry a "manure basket". The style of the cadres has changed greatly, the enthusiasm of the masses has been boosted, and the real mass movement has also been carried out. Since the beginning of this year, the work of this commune has greatly improved.
                      ＊＊＊
    We once put forward the slogan of "striving to become a thousand-jin county for three wheats" and launched a thousand-jin competition for three wheats. Now it has only reached a yield of a thousand jin per mu on individual small pieces of land, and has not reached it on a large area in the county. It should be affirmed that the thousand-jin competition for three wheats has greatly spurred us, repeatedly boosted morale, and repeatedly added measures, which has greatly contributed to winning the unprecedentedly large increase in the production of three wheats this year. However, the three wheats in Yangzhong have always been low-yielding in the past, the foundation is relatively poor, and we lack experience. We have underestimated the conditions required to achieve a yield of a thousand jin per mu of three wheats in the county. Judging from this year's experience, to achieve a yield of a thousand jin per mu of three wheats in the county, it is necessary to further earnestly strengthen agricultural capital construction, especially the construction of water, fertilizer, soil, and seed, to lay a more reliable foundation.
    According to the existing conditions, is it possible to strive for a higher yield than it is now? Recently, we held symposiums in various places to summarize the successful experience of increasing the production of three wheats, and also found some loopholes in the work. These loopholes are: more than 4,000 mu of fields were improperly ploughed, destroying the soil layer; more than 20,000 mu of fields were over-sown, of which more than 9,000 mu lodged due to improper management and fertilization, although they were rescued, but they have suffered some losses; some remote fields and remote areas did not seize the opportunity to accumulate fertilizer before winter, and there was a shortage of fertilizer; half of the wheat fields adopted broadcast sowing, and the yield of broadcast sowing was lower than the yield of strip sowing, because strip sowing ventilates and lights, and is convenient for processing and management; the wheat intercropped in green manure fields was later in time, and less sowing. These loopholes in the cultivation process of three wheats just show that even under the existing conditions, as long as our work is done better, we can still dig out considerable potential for increasing production.
    Now, we are launching a nationwide summary of the experience of increasing the production of three wheats this year to promote striving for a bumper harvest in autumn, and to prepare for striving for an increase in the production of three wheats next year.

    一步不让　一着不漏
    ——从全县三麦大幅度增产汲取经验
    中共江苏扬中县委第一书记　朱维中
    处在扬子江中心的扬中县二十万人民，经过一冬一春的奋战，已经夺得了三麦（大麦、元麦、小麦）全面大丰收的丰硕果实。今年三麦的丰收，有两个特色。一是不仅单位产量有大幅度增长，而且由于多种高产多收，总产量有很大的增长。三麦总产量从1958年的二千二百一十七万斤，增加到四千二百九十六万斤，增长93.77％；十万多亩麦田的单位产量（不包括夹种和零星土地产量），从1958年的一百九十八斤提高到三百六十二斤，增长82.9％。二是全县各个地区都比较平衡的有了较大的增产。以高产地区的幸福公社和低产地区的丰裕公社为例，幸福公社的单位产量从1958年的二百八十三斤，增加到了三百八十斤；丰裕公社则从一百五十五斤，增加到了三百一十五斤。全县十万多亩麦田，亩产三百斤至四百斤的占68％，四百斤至五百斤的占11.5％，五百斤以上的占9.9％，亩产不到三百斤的，只占总面积的10.6％。
    现在，三麦已经全部脱粒入仓。由于三麦大增产，全县95％以上的社员都增加了收入，社员分得的口粮比去年同期有所增加，出售给国家的三麦，也从去年的二百零六万斤跃增到一千零十七万斤，超额完成了售粮计划。
                            ＊＊＊
    为什么今年三麦能够获得这样大幅度的增产呢？根据我们的经验看来，促成三麦增产的因素是多方面的；既抓紧了推行精耕细作的各项技术措施，又抓紧了农田基本建设，为增产创造有利条件；既力争单位产量增长；又尽一切可能做到了不减少而且扩大了种植面积，可靠地保证了总产量的增长；在领导三麦生产的整个过程中，从种到收，我们都尽力做到“从头抓起，环环扣紧，一步不让，一着不漏”，使三麦能够胜利地通过各个“关”，茁壮地成长。
      合理安排作物布局，充分挖掘
        土地潜力，做到多种高产多收
    去年秋种的时候，我们首先遇到的是夏熟作物的布局问题。对于这个问题，我们有两条基本指导思想：一条是，要确保三麦单产和总产的增长，同时要力争绿肥增产，以便增加秋熟作物的基肥。一条是，扬中人多地少，每人平均只有八分水田和一分高地，必须合理安排作物布局，进一步充分利用一切可耕土地，挖掘土地潜力，做到多种、高产、多收。
    在这方面，我们采取了以下几项措施：
    第一、改草（绿肥）麦夹种为草麦分种。1958年，这里单种的麦田只有三万多亩，其它近十三万亩都是草、麦夹种。今年以十万四千多亩种植三麦，以六万多亩种植绿肥。这样，绿肥的种植面积扩大了六千多亩，三麦的种植面积减少了六千多亩（以草麦夹种一亩折单种麦田六分计算），但是，由于分种，就便于精心加工管理，提高单位面积产量。
    第二、充分利用零星土地扩种三麦。我们利用高地以及田边、河边、屋边、路边等“十边”一切没有种上蔬菜、饲料的零星荒地，以及准备兴修水利尚未动工的空地，扩种了七千多亩麦子，做到了“寸土必争”，不浪费一块土地。
    第三、在播种以后，我们看到一部分绿肥田生长情况不好，又立即抢时间在绿肥田中点种了二万多亩麦子。
    有些同志对于县委所采取的这种多种、高产、多收的方针，曾经有所抵触。有人满足于对十万多亩大田可能增产幅度的估计，对于力争广种多收不够积极。我们批判了这种思想，强调必须把三麦总产量的增长建立在更加切实可靠的基础上，必须留有余地。改草麦分种以后的三麦总产量能超过去年多少，我们还没有经验，因此，绝不能忽视同时实行广种多收，尽一切可能扩大三麦种植面积。
    有人认为，在高地、十边和水利工地的零星荒废土地上到处星星点点地种上麦子，不正规，不好看，不合“标准”。我们反对这种看法，扬中的耕地这么少，粮食问题还没有得到解决，当前是一寸土地一寸金，能尽一切办法多抓到一点粮食都是好的，决不能离开这个大前提来谈所谓“正规”和“标准”。
    有些人比较热心于计算单位产量，不大热心于计算总产量，他们怕扩大种植零星闲地以后，要降低平均单位面积的产量。因此，我们特别强调，粮食的增产应该集中表现在总产量的增加上。提高大田的单位产量是增加总产量的重要方面，而广种零星闲地，集少成多，也能够有效地增加总产量。
    现在，实践的结果证明，这样做是正确的。三麦的种植面积不仅不少于去年，而且多于去年。从绿肥夹种和高地、十边零星闲地扩大种植的麦田中，一共收到了五百多万斤麦子，占三麦总产量的12％以上。六万多亩绿肥，包括二万多亩点种麦子的绿肥，都得到了丰收，平均每亩产量达五千斤，也比去年提高了66％。
      因地制宜抓紧农业基本建设，
          进一步改造三麦生产条件
    今年三麦告捷，同农业基本建设的成果是分不开的。
    从扬中的客观条件来看，这里四面环江，多数土地比较肥沃；水源充足，一般不怕干旱；地少人多，便于精耕细作，这些是争取三麦增产的有利方面。但是，地势低洼，江面水位经常超过地面一公尺，因而地下水位很高，积水不易排泄，常常遭受严重涝害；有三万多亩漏沙田，土质很坏，这些又是争取三麦增产的不利方面。因此，进行农业基本建设，特别是农田水利建设，是确保三麦增产的一个关键。
      去年秋种以前，我们曾经具体地分析几年来农业基本建设对于扬中三麦生产条件所起的影响。从1955年冬开始，我们每年都抓了农田水利，初步整修了沿江堤防和各条河道，建设了几十座涵闸，大大减少了洪涝灾害；三万多亩漏沙田有二万多亩得到了改造；养猪和绿肥也都有了发展。因此，三麦的产量也起了显著的变化，在1955年以前，平均单位产量只有五、六十斤至一百斤左右，从1956年至1958年，平均单位产量就增加到一百五十斤至二百斤左右。但是，洪涝灾害还未根本解除，特别是五万亩洼地涝害还很严重，这些洼地在丰收的1958年，三麦亩产也只有一百斤左右。至于肥料，仍然普遍感到不足。很明显，不进一步抓紧基本建设，就不可能进一步改造生产条件，就要使精耕细作的各项技术措施受到很大限制，争取全县大面积大幅度增产，就难以有可靠的保证。
    根据扬中的情况，我们在基本建设方面的指导思想是：一、以水利带头，同时抓紧肥料的基本建设。一冬一春，我们开浚港道五百多条，做了五百八十多万土方；全部麦田都建设了田间排水系统，做到了“沟沟通河，河河通港，港港通江”，进一步控制了江水的进出，降低了地下水位；同时，继续扩种绿肥，养好十万多头猪（平均一亩田有零点七头猪），县社队并建立了一批土化肥厂。二、集中优势兵力，成块成块地“吃”。我们预计到，扬中人力充足，水利建设已有基础，在公社化以后，已完全有可能把五万亩洼地“吃”下来。因此，去年就在洼地大力开港建闸，开浚排涝渠道，增添了二十台抽水机，消灭了洼地涝害。
    关于基本建设的方针，譬如关于治水的方针，曾经有过争论。我们从扬中水源充足、地势低洼、怕涝而不怕旱的客观情况出发，坚持治水应以排涝为主；根据扬中耕地很少，和旧有河道纵横、已经粗具“网”的雏形的实际情况，坚持了充分利用旧有河道、尽可能不挖掉或少挖掉耕地的勤俭治水的方针。这条方针看来是正确的。按照这条方针治水，已经初获成效。但是在去年冬天，我们县里有些同志却想机械搬用别地
  “河网化”建设的经验，要以灌溉为主，河道和两旁的建设也要合于高标准，因此，需要大开新河道，填掉旧河道。如果按照这种做法，全县需要填掉75％左右的旧河道，挖掉一万七千多亩、即占全县10％左右的耕地。这样做显然是不适宜的，不能同意这些同志的做法。从治水方针的这一番争论中，使我们更深刻地体会到，在进行农业基本建设的时候，一定要认真地调查研究，具体地分析客观条件，坚持因地因时制宜的原则。
    现在回顾一下，我们这样抓基本建设是正确的。特别是，如果不集中力量“吃”掉五万亩洼地的水利工程，那么，这五万亩地就不可能从去年亩产一百斤左右一跳跳到亩产三百斤左右。但是，基本建设工作还远不能适应继续争取大面积高产的需要，水利还需继续兴修，肥料不足始终是一个很大困难，今年一部分远田和偏僻地带的麦田，就因为肥料不足，影响产量。因此，今后必须把肥料的基本建设工作，提高到更加重要的位置上来。
      实行精耕细作，使基本建设所创造
        的有利条件充分发挥增产效能
    要使基本建设工作所创造的有利条件充分发挥它的增产效能，要使土地充分发挥它的潜力，就必须实行精耕细作，推行各项先进的技术措施。
    扬中虽然人多地少，但是过去三麦的耕作却很粗放。这是因为：一、三麦常常受涝减产，群众重水稻、轻三麦，直到1956年，由于大力兴修农田水利，才逐步有所改变；二、解放以前，有五万多劳动力外出各地，直到1956年以后，才陆续回来了约三万人。现在，全县有七万左右的劳动力，其中妇女约占三分之二。在目前强调改变耕作粗放现象，实行精耕细作，不仅必要，而且已经有了比较好的条件。
    今年三麦耕作同过去比较起来，有些什么不同呢？
    第一、麦田在播种以前，全部深翻了五、六寸至一尺左右。而1955年以前，这里麦田都是不耕就种的。1956年以后，也只有一部分土地在播种前耕过。
    第二、扩大了麦埨，缩小了荒塿子。麦埨由过去的四尺扩大到八尺，荒塿由过去的六寸缩小到四寸，提高了土地的利用率。
    第三、推行了密植。全县有二万多亩播种量过多，麦苗太密；其它播种在二十五斤到三十五斤左右，比较合理。
    第四、采用良种。已经做到了普遍采用“扬中红”和“2419”、“矮粒多”良种，并且经过了风、筛、粒、盐选种和药剂拌种。
    第五、增施肥料。今年每亩平均基肥施了一百担左右的精肥料，追肥一般有四、五次，最多的达到十次，最少的也有三次，平均比去年多二次。基肥和追肥量都比去年增加一倍，而且一般都注意“看田、看苗、看时”，合理施肥。例如在圆秆拔节阶段，为了促使麦苗秆粗秆硬，穗大粒多，对一、二类苗，大施磷、钾肥，三类苗，先施一次氮肥，再施磷、钾肥，使它赶上一、二类苗。
    第六、麦田普遍开了排水渠道。渠深一尺到一尺五寸，加速排泄积水，降低了地下水位。
    第七、普遍进行撩墒盖土，有些还铺上草和建立了田头熏土窑，保护麦苗越冬。而在1955年以前，一般都不撩墒盖土。1956年以后，也只有部分麦田撩墒盖土，以致有些麦苗受冻减产。
    第八、麦田中耕锄草普遍达到四、五次，而在过去一般只锄草二次。
    总之，在“耕作园艺化，管麦如绣花”的口号下，我们积极地推行了各项先进技术措施，精耕细作确实比过去大大的前进了一步。
    为什么我们今年能够比较好的推行了各项增产措施，实行了精耕细作呢？从党委的领导工作来说，主要的经验有四条：一是自始至终抓紧领导，我们的口号是：“从头抓起，环环扣紧，一步不让，一着不漏”；二是遇事同群众商量，我们的口号是：“寻师访友，求谋问计”；三是干部带头，一切经过试验，我们的口号是：“人人有试点，事事有样子”；四是干部学习技术，我们的口号是：“学习科学”和“拜老农为师”。这四条做得好，结合得好，就可以做到既抓紧了领导，又不致犯强迫命令的毛病；既贯彻了群众路线，又不致放任自流。
    必须抓得早，抓得紧。我们除了从去年秋种一开始就抓紧了农时季节、种植面积、深翻和播种质量以外，在秋种以前一个半月，全县就掀起了大搞麦田基肥积肥的群众运动。三麦管理过程中，对越冬、返青、拔节、抽穗、防止倒伏、防止病虫害等各个“关”，我们都提早十天到半个月进行准备，提出措施，并迅速贯彻下去。例如为了促进三麦返青、拔节、抽穗，全县提早大搞水粪塘，积集螺丝肥五百五十七万斤（含有钾、磷、氮等成分），各种土化肥（以熏土、蚌壳等作原料）一亿三千多万斤，从而保证了绝大部分麦田适时追肥的需要。在遇到灾害袭击的时候，领导上必须多谋善断，迅速采取坚定的措施。在2月间阴雨连绵，和3月间地下水位上升的时候，我们每次都坚决组织了五万多人次，日夜投入突击排除积水和降低地下水位的战斗，确保了作物不致受涝减产。在3月下旬，全县开始发现九千三百多亩麦田有程度不同的倒伏现象，群众中产生了一些埋怨情绪，认为“密植搞坏了”，我们立即当机立断，坚定不移地贯彻四项措施：一、实行间苗，去细枝，留壮秆；二、散播改条播，通风透光；三、大力追施磷钾肥；四、洒草木灰水，使这些田得以挽救，亩产仍在三、四百斤左右。
    但是，抓紧领导必须贯彻群众路线，学会遇事同群众商量。今年三麦管理中的各个“关”，我们都召开了老农和技术员座谈会，向群众求谋问计。例如：在一部分生长不好的绿肥田中点种麦子，就是同老农和技术员一起研究以后才做的。又如关于大搞螺蛳肥以帮助解决追肥不足的困难，关于采取洒草木灰水等办法以防止倒伏和抢救倒伏的麦苗等措施，都是一些有经验的老农和技术员在座谈会上提出来，经过试验，做出样子，及时推广的。
    为了正确加强对于生产技术的领导，干部学习技术越来越是重要了。全县从县委、公社党委到管理区的各级干部，都拜老农为师。我自己的师傅是劳动模范黄美善。从去冬以来，我访问了他不下十次之多，向他学习了有关锄草、施肥、防倒伏等不少经验。我们还坚持和发展了搞“试验田”的经验，全县干部和群众相结合，种植一万多亩试验田，进行了各种不同生产技术的试验。很多干部还紧密结合生产，钻研农业知识的书籍。这样，就大大有利于各项技术措施的贯彻。我们深深地体会到，生产的领导越来越具体，越来越细致，不抓紧学好技术，不做到既红又专，就必然落在形势发展的后面。今年三麦生产中出现的一些漏洞，有些就是由于我们还没有学好技术所造成的。
      切实改进工作方法和工作作风，
      使群众运动轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实
    领导三麦大面积增产的过程，就是大搞群众运动的过程。我们的经验说明，只有大搞群众运动，才可能使人人发挥冲天干劲，有力地贯彻增产措施，积极地为增产创造条件。
    在大搞群众运动中，我们接受了去年一些好的工作方法，也摸索到了一些新的工作方法。
    一定要使大跃进的思想在群众中扎根。秋种以前，县和公社都召开了群众大会和小型座谈会，总结1958年大丰收的经验，讨论1959年夏熟增产的规划，群众共提出了二万多条意见。各个公社还广泛采用了展览会、黑板报、鼓动牌等方式，形成以千斤干劲、千斤措施来力争三麦大增产的高涨的政治空气。随着三麦增产运动的发展，群众的情绪随胜利而高兴，遇困难而波动。每逢遇到困难和贯彻重大的先进技术措施时，我们都组织了全民大讨论，分析条件，找出办法，坚定大跃进的思想。由于抓紧了这些工作，特别是人民公社经过整顿，进一步改进了经营管理和贯彻了按劳分配原则，就使群众的积极性不断提高，促进生产高潮一浪接一浪。
    开展红旗竞赛，组织检查评比，自始至终贯穿了三麦生产的整个过程。一方面，以社对社、队对队、人对人，按季节、按农活开展了竞赛；大规模的群众性的检查评比，全县每一生产阶段组织一次，公社一个月一次，从而经常造成热气腾腾的学先进、赶先进的局面。另一方面，我们又特别强调了各级领导干部经常进行“小检查”，切切实实发现问题，解决问题。因此，今年的红旗竞赛和检查评比工作，较之去年有显著的进步，主要表现在：一、过去的检查，多半是被当地干部带着跑，看的是中心地带；现在是带着当地干部走，不仅看中心地带，也看偏僻地带，这样就帮助了当地干部克服忽视偏僻地带工作的弱点。二、过去的检查，一般只注意表扬和推广先进公社的经验，现在我们提出“在先进公社要注意找弱点，在落后公社要注意鼓干劲”，帮助“落后”公社创造一些好经验，鞭策先进公社防止自满，不断前进。今年以来，我们在原来工作落后的丰裕公社召开了四次现场会议，大大地调动了他们和其它“落后”公社的积极性。
    要把群众运动开展起来，并且扎扎实实地坚持下去，一定要认真改进干部的思想作风。秋种一结束，我们就坚决地层层建立责任制，实行县委书记包片，县委委员包社，公社干部包管理区，管理区干部包生产队，生产队干部包圩，社员包田的制度。县委各部门也下社办公，抓住基点，联系实际，指导全面。整社以后，各级干部又进一步实行“固定地点劳动，分片领导”。这样，对三麦增产的群众运动的领导就比较深入细致了。经验证明，哪里的干部思想作风不好，哪里就不会有真正的群众运动。丰裕公社就是一个比较典型的例子。这里的不少干部过去作风很飘浮，经常穿鞋穿袜，不参加生产，以致群众的积极性不能很好的调动起来。我们认真地督促他们切实转变作风，首先从下决心脱下鞋袜，背上“粪筐”做起。干部的作风大变，群众的干劲被鼓了起来，真正的群众运动也开展起来了。今年以来，这个公社的工作已大有起色。
                      ＊＊＊
    我们曾经提出“力争成为三麦千斤县”的口号，发起了三麦千斤竞赛。现在只是在个别小块土地上达到亩产千斤，在全县大面积上并没有达到。应该肯定，三麦千斤竞赛大大地鞭策了我们，一再鼓足干劲，一再措施加码，这对夺得今年三麦空前大幅度增产有很大作用。但是，扬中三麦过去一向低产，基础较差，我们也缺少经验，对实现全县三麦亩产千斤所需要具备的条件估计不足。从今年的经验看来，要实现全县三麦亩产千斤，需要进一步认真地加强农业基本建设，特别是水、肥、土、种的建设，才能打下比较可靠的基础。
    根据现有的条件，是不是可以争取到比现在更高一些的产量呢？最近我们在各地召开座谈会，总结三麦增产的成功经验，也找出工作中的一些漏洞。这些漏洞是：有四千多亩田深翻不当，破坏土层；有二万多亩田下种过多，其中有九千多亩因管理、施肥不当而倒伏，虽经抢救，但已受了一些损失；一部分远田和偏僻地带，在冬前没有抓紧积肥，肥料不足；有一半的麦田采取散播，散播的产量比条播的产量低些，因为条播通风透光，而且便于加工管理；绿肥田中夹种的麦子，时间晚了一些，下种少了一些。三麦耕作过程中的这些漏洞，恰好说明了即是在现有条件下，只要我们的工作做得好些，也还可以挖出不小的增产潜力。
    现在，我们正在发动全民总结今年三麦增产的经验，以促进争取秋熟丰收，并为争取明年三麦增产提早进行准备。
