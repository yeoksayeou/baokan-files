Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 21st: The recent Fujian Herbalist Representatives' Experience Exchange Conference, using various methods such as symposium introductions, technical instruction, and on-site herb gathering, exchanged over 2,800 pieces of carefully selected herbal secret recipes and proven prescriptions from various regions. It compiled and sorted out the different names, uses, and usages of more than 700 commonly used folk herbs throughout the province, basically resolving the confusion of different names for the same herb or the same name for different herbs. Through this experience exchange, the role of folk herbalists and herbs will be further enhanced, making it easier for medical personnel to use herbs to fight diseases.

Fujian Province has many mountains, a mild climate, and a wide variety of herbs, with abundant reserves. There are also thousands of folk herbalists distributed in the vast rural areas and towns of the province, using herbs to prevent and treat diseases for the masses. In recent years, the medical and health departments of Fujian Province have taken measures to strengthen the work of folk herbalists and herbs, achieving great results. Fujian Provincial People's Hospital and some specialized district and city hospitals have herbal medicine departments, and many cities and counties have folk herbalist joint clinics. They adopt the method of combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, learning from each other and exchanging experiences, and have jointly summarized many treatment experiences of folk herbalists and herbs. In terms of scientific research, the Fujian Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine has a research office specializing in the study of folk herbalists and herbs. They closely cooperate with the Provincial Drug Inspection Institute, the Biology Department of Fujian Normal University, and other units to scientifically identify more than 400 kinds of herbs, and have conducted laboratory tests on some herbs, compiling and printing four volumes of "Fujian Folk Herbs."

At this provincial herbalist representatives' experience exchange conference, 186 representatives from various counties and cities brought 2,823 specimens and nearly 1,000 pieces of experience materials collected from various regions for exchange at the meeting. The representatives unanimously stated that they will do their best to enrich the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine and better serve the people's health in the future.

Xinhua News Agency: Since February this year, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has collected more than 46,000 pieces of various precious traditional Chinese medicine secret recipes and proven prescriptions, and more than 800 volumes of traditional Chinese medicine books.

In collecting traditional Chinese medicine, all regions have formed folklore collection teams combining professional medical cadres and the masses, going deep into rural areas and towns to interview people. The folklore collection team of more than 10 people in Zhongwei County went to various communes and production teams to promote and collect simultaneously. In just over a month, they collected more than 2,000 secret recipes and proven prescriptions. Teachers and students of Yinchuan Health School went deep among the masses to collect folklore, collecting more than 8,000 secret recipes and proven prescriptions in three months.

After hearing the publicity, the Hui and Han people in various places have offered effective secret recipes passed down for generations. An old commune member of Yaofu Commune in Pingluo County offered a bone-setting secret recipe passed down for five generations. Mr. Yang Guanyu, a famous doctor in Yinchuan City, offered the Sanxiandan formula, a special medicine with a forty-year history for treating syphilis.

    在这次全省草医代表经验交流会上，各县市的一百八十六名代表带来了由各地整理出来的二千八百二十三件标本和近千篇经验材料，在会上进行了交流。代表们一致表示今后要尽力丰富祖国医学宝库，更好地为人民健康服务。
    据新华社讯　宁夏回族自治区从今年2月份以来；搜集到各种珍贵的中药秘方验方四万六千多件，中医药书八百多册。
    各地在搜集中医中药时，都以专业医疗干部和群众相结合的方法组成采风队，深入农村、城镇采访。中卫县由十多人组成的采风队，到各公社和生产队边宣传、边搜集，仅一个多月的时间，就搜集到秘方验方二千多件。银川卫生学校师生深入群众采风，三个月内采集秘方验方八千多件。
