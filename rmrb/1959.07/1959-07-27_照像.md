Taking a Photo
    Li Xue'ao
    Having loaded the film and adjusted the aperture,
    the young reporter arrived at the spacious workshop—
    to take a photo of the Party Secretary,
    to be published in the newspaper.
    Hundreds of motors hummed joyfully,
    Hundreds of machines spun,
    Hundreds of hands were busy operating,
    Hundreds of faces glowed red,
    Which one is the Party Secretary?
    Couldn't find him for a long time.
    Hastily asked the workers,
    The workers answered cleverly:
    "The Party Secretary works as a worker,
    he does every job.
    If you want to take a photo, just look around and take it,
    He's right here among us!"

    照像
    李学鳌上好胶卷，对好光圈，年轻的记者，来到宽大的车间——给党委书记照像，要登在报纸上边。几百台马达欢唱，几百架机器飞转，几百双手操作忙，几百张脸上红光闪，党委书记是哪个？半天没找见。忙把工人问，工人答得妙：“党委书记当工人什么活儿他都干。要照像你就看着照，他就在我们中间！”
