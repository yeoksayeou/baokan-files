　　Breaking Through Raw Materials
　　Spinning Good Cotton Yarn

　　(Our report) Shanghai State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill, under the leadership of the Party Committee, focused on several key checkpoints including inspection, cotton allocation, scutching, steel wire workshops, and temperature and humidity. By implementing a series of technical measures, they successfully spun higher-grade cotton yarn using lower-grade cotton blends. In the first half of June, the percentage of superior first-grade yarn spun from cotton averaging 6.9 grade reached 98.21%.

　　Since the end of February this year, the Shanghai State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill has been using raw cotton with high moisture content and many impurities, with the raw cotton generally graded at seven, eight, or nine. Some workers believed that further quality improvement could only be achieved by waiting for the higher-quality cotton to be allocated by the higher authorities. In response to this thinking, the Party Committee repeatedly explained the importance of quality improvement to the workers. At the same time, it held forums with veteran workers to study methods for spinning high-grade cotton yarn with low-grade cotton blends, and mobilized workers to analyze and experiment whether low-grade cotton blends had the potential to be spun into higher-grade cotton yarn. The analysis revealed that although the grade of the cotton blend was low, the cotton had good maturity, fine fibers, and high strength. Test spinning using Grade 6 Pingyuan cotton produced very good quality yarn.

　　In the past, only spot checks were carried out on each batch of raw cotton entering the factory. Now, each package is inspected and test-spun in small quantities. The workers master the properties of the raw cotton before using it. Workers in the scutching and steel wire workshops, focusing on the shortcomings of raw cotton such as high impurity and moisture content, strengthened the preliminary processing of raw cotton. Before the cotton is used, it is first dried in a cotton drying machine to reduce moisture. When the raw cotton passes through the scutching machine and the steel wire carding machine, an operating method of less beating and more loosening is adopted, which can remove impurities without damaging the fibers.

　　Strengthening temperature and humidity management is also a way to improve quality. If the temperature and humidity in the spinning workshop are low, fewer ends will break. However, to improve the strength of the cotton yarn and the evenness, a higher temperature in the spinning room is required, which is a contradiction. This factory solved this contradiction by increasing the moisture regain of the roving. This shows that although the grade of cotton is lower, if a specific analysis of the difficulties can be made, and corresponding measures taken, the quality of the cotton yarn can be improved.

### 突破原料  关纺出好棉纱

    突破原料
    关纺出好棉纱
    本报讯　上海国棉一厂，在党委的领导下，把住检验、配棉、清花、钢丝车间和温湿度等几道关口，采取一系列技术措施，终于用较低级配棉纺出较高等级的棉纱。6月上半月，用平均六点九级棉花纺出的上等一级纱达到98.21％。
    国棉一厂从今年2月底开始，所用原棉含水量高，杂质多，原棉等级一般都在七、八、九级。职工中有部分人认为：要进一步提高质量，只有等待上级配好棉。党委针对这种思想，反复向职工讲明提高质量的重要性，同时，召开老工人座谈会，研究低等级配棉纺高等级棉纱的办法。并发动职工分析试验低等级配棉是否有纺成较高等级棉纱的条件。分析结果，发现配棉等级虽然低，但是棉花成熟度好、纤维细、强度较高。用六级平原棉花，试纺出来的纱质量很好。
    过去每批原棉进厂后只进行抽验，现在都逐包检验和小量试纺，工人们掌握了原棉性能再使用。清花和钢丝车间的职工，围绕原棉杂质多、含水多的缺点，加强原棉的预先处理工作。棉花使用以前，先用烘棉机烘一道，使水分减少；在原棉通过清花车和钢丝车时，采取少打多松的操作法，既可以除去杂质又不伤纤维。
    加强温湿度管理工作，也是提高质量的一个办法。细纱车间温湿度低了，可以少出断头，但要提高棉纱和条干强力，却又要求细纱间有较高的温度，这是一个矛盾。这个厂采取提高前纺回潮的办法，解决了这个矛盾。由此可见，棉花等级虽然低一些，如能对困难进行具体分析，从而采取相应的措施，棉纱质量是可以提高的。
