In Shuibei Commune and the suburban commune of Pucheng County, Fujian Province, branched early japonica rice has been successively discovered. These branched early japonica rice plants are from the “Aomori No. 5” variety introduced from other places. One plant has two to four branches, all sprouting from the leaf axils of the stem near the ground. Most of the branches grow from the second node of the stalk, some with two to five nodes, each node having branches that have already headed. Each ear mostly has about seventy grains. This variation in japonica rice provides data for breeding branched rice varieties.

    浦城发现分枝粳稻
    福建省浦城县水北公社及城郊公社陆续发现有分枝早粳。这些分枝早粳是从外地引入的“青森五号”。一本分枝有二至四枝不等，都是从地上茎部叶腋生出，大多是在秆茎第二节上生出分枝，有的二到五节，每节都有分枝并且都已抽穗，每穗大多有七十粒左右。这种变异的粳稻给选育分枝水稻良种提供了资料。
