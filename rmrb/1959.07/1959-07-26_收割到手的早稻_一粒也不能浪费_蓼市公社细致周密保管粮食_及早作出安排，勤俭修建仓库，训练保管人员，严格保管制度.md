Changsha, July 25th (from our newspaper) -- The Lushi People's Commune in Chen County, Hunan Province, drawing on past experiences, has strengthened grain storage work while doing a good job in the meticulous threshing and harvesting of early rice. As of July 20th, 3,050,000 jin of grain, in addition to the state-requisitioned grain, had been dried, winnowed, and put into storage. Storage work has been grasped earlier and better than in any previous year.

As early as before the "Double Rush" (of harvesting and planting) began in June, the Commune Party Committee seriously studied the issue of harvesting well, storing well, and using grain well. This year's early rice harvest is a bumper one, and storage work must keep up accordingly. However, the existing number of storage personnel is small, their political and professional level is relatively low, and the original grain warehouses are also few, which cannot meet the needs of grain storage after a bumper harvest. Moreover, some cadres and the masses do not pay enough attention to storing grain well.

The Commune Party Committee believes that to do a good job in grain storage, the first step is to correct the ideological understanding of cadres and the masses. Therefore, it organized cadres and the masses to conduct a discussion on the issue of grain storage, summarizing the experiences and lessons of the past year. Everyone believed that after the people's communes were established, grain was strengthened through planned management, ensuring the normal supply of grain to the broad masses of commune members, which was unprecedented. However, last year, some teams did not have strict inspection and acceptance storage systems, and un-dried rice was also put into the warehouse. Some warehouses were not properly repaired, some storage personnel lacked a sense of responsibility, and the principle of planned grain use and economical grain use was not fully implemented, resulting in damage and waste of a lot of grain. Everyone realized that grain must not only be harvested well but also stored well and used well. Commune members of Gaopo Brigade said, "Having a good fishing net, you also need a good creel, otherwise, no matter how many fish you catch, it will be a waste of effort!"

After unifying ideological understanding, the Commune Party Committee began to prepare sufficient warehouses. It is estimated that the entire commune, after deducting the pre-paid grain requisition, will need to store nearly four million jin of grain, but the original warehouses can only hold about two million jin of grain, and many of them need to be repaired. The commune then mobilized the masses, based on the principles of "making do with whatever is available, repairing before building" and "adapting to local conditions and using local materials" to run the commune frugally, making use of all available ancestral halls, temples, and public rooms. It organized fifty carpenters and a number of commune members to build 525 new warehouses and expand 77 warehouses, with a storage capacity of 2.8 million jin. In addition, a comprehensive repair was carried out on the original warehouses, repairing leaky roofs, blocking rat holes, weaving bird-proof curtains, and disinfecting all warehouses three times. All warehouses inside have achieved "six-sided smoothness" (top, bottom, left, right, front, and back), and the outside of the warehouses achieved "five no-nos" (no sewage, weeds, broken bricks, tiles, or flammables).

In order to manage grain well, major brigades and production teams have also mobilized the masses to formulate grain storage systems.

(1) Established a responsibility system. In addition to the state requisitioned grain being managed by the commune grain management station, the brigade manages self-retained seeds, feed, and reserve grain, and the production team mainly manages rations. Each team has adjusted the original custodians, selected a number of active, reliable, and enthusiastic commune members to act as full-time custodians. The commune also centralized all custodians for training, learning grain distribution policies and grain storage knowledge. (2) Established and improved the procedures for grain receipt and payment. It emphasizes that warehouse keepers, work recorders, and inspectors go deep into the fields and threshing floors, participate in grain harvesting, grasp the yield situation, implement "three weighings" (weighing of unhusked grain, weighing after drying, and weighing of dry grain when entering the warehouse), and fill in the "three-part form" when entering the warehouse. The accounts of the work team, production team, and brigade must be consistent with each other to ensure that accounts match accounts and accounts match reality. The use of warehouse grain must comply with the prescribed approval procedures. (3) In order to prevent grain from molding and deteriorating, to achieve "no rats, no birds, no insect pests, no mold, and no accidents," a daily inspection system for custodians has been established, stipulating a small inspection every five days, a large inspection every ten days, and inspections at any time during strong winds and heavy rains. (4) Taking the warehouse as a unit, a warehouse protection team has been established to assist the custodian in doing a good job in the security of the granary. (5) A cleaning and sanitation system has been established. The warehouse keeper must do a small cleaning every five days and a large cleaning every ten days, leaving no mud, weeds, or garbage, and maintaining the constant cleanliness of the warehouse.

While establishing and improving various grain storage systems, the commune has extensively educated commune members on saving grain and planning grain use, urging everyone to think ahead and make careful calculations in grain use, thinking about next year this year. And according to the experience of recent years, it has stipulated some specific measures for planned grain use.

In order to strengthen leadership over grain storage work, the commune has established a grain management committee, the brigade has established a branch, and the production team has established a group. Headed by the secretary, inspections and comparisons are carried out regularly to summarize advanced experiences and promote them in a timely manner. (Attached picture)

### 收割到手的早稻　一粒也不能浪费  蓼市公社细致周密保管粮食  及早作出安排，勤俭修建仓库，训练保管人员，严格保管制度

    收割到手的早稻　一粒也不能浪费
    蓼市公社细致周密保管粮食
    及早作出安排，勤俭修建仓库，训练保管人员，严格保管制度
    本报长沙25日电　湖南郴县蓼市人民公社吸取往年的经验，在作好早稻细打细收的同时，加强了粮食保管工作。到7月20日止，除向国家预交的征购粮外，已有三百零五万斤粮食晒干扬净入库。保管工作比以往任何一年都抓得早、抓得好。
    早在6月份“双抢”开始之前，公社党委就认真研究了收好、管好、用好粮食的问题。今年早稻大丰收，保管工作必须相应地跟上去，但是现有的保管人员数量少，政治、业务水平也较低，原有粮食仓库也较少，不能适应大丰收后粮食保管工作的需要；而且部分干部和群众对管好粮食还不够重视。
    公社党委认为要做好粮食保管工作，首先在于端正干部和群众思想认识，于是组织干部和群众开展了一次关于粮食保管问题的讨论，总结了去年的经验和教训。大家认为人民公社化后，粮食加强了计划管理，保证了广大社员粮食的正常供应，这是从未有过的好事。但是去年有些队没有严格的检查验收保管制度，没有晒干的谷子也进了仓，有的仓库没有整修好，有的保管员责任心不强，计划用粮、节约用粮的原则执行不够，损坏和浪费了不少粮食。大家认识了粮食不仅要收好，还要管好、用好。高坡大队的社员们说：“有副好鱼网，还得有个好鱼篓，不然，鱼捞得再多，也是白费力气！”
    在统一思想认识后，公社党委便着手准备足够的仓库。全社早稻除去预交征购粮以外，估计需要由公社保管的粮食将近四百万斤，但原有的仓库只能装谷二百万斤左右，并且有很多还要修理。公社便发动群众，根据“因陋就简，先修后建”和“因地制宜，就地取材”等勤俭办社的原则，利用一切可以利用的祠堂、庙宇、公室，组织五十个木工和一部分社员新建仓库五百二十五个，扩建仓库七十七个，库容达二百八十万斤；另外，对原有仓库进行了一次全面修理，检屋漏、堵鼠洞、编织防雀帘，并把全部仓库消毒三次。所有仓库里面都做到了上下左右前后“六面光”，仓外“五不留”（污水、杂草、碎砖、瓦片、易燃物不留）。
    为了管好粮食，各大队、生产队还发动群众制定了粮食保管制度。
  （1）建立了责任制。除国家征购粮由公社粮食管理站管理以外，大队管自留种子、饲料、储备粮，生产队主要是管口粮。各队对原有的保管员进行了一次调整，选定了一批积极可靠、热心为群众办事的社员担任专职保管员。公社还集中所有保管员进行了训练，学习粮食分配政策和粮食保管知识。（2）建立和健全了粮食收入、支拨手续。强调保管员、记工员、验收员深入田间、晒场，参加打禾，掌握产量情况，实行“三过秤”（毛谷过秤，晒干后过秤，干谷入库时过秤），入库时填写“三联单”。作业组、生产队、大队的账都要互相对头，保证账账相符，账实相符。动用仓库粮食，必须遵守规定的批准手续。（3）为了防止粮食霉烂变质，作到“无鼠雀、无虫害、无霉烂、无事故”，建立了保管员的日常检查制度，规定五天一小检查，十天一大检查，大风大雨随时检查。（4）以仓库为单位，成立了护仓小组，协助保管员做好粮库的保卫工作。（5）建立了清洁卫生制度。保管员必须五天搞一次小扫除，十天一大扫除，不留污泥、杂草、垃圾，保持仓库的经常清洁。
    在建立、健全各项粮食保管制度的同时，这个公社向社员广泛进行了节约用粮、计划用粮的教育，要大家在用粮上必须瞻前顾后，细水长流，今年想到明年。并且根据几年来的经验，规定了一些计划用粮的具体措施。
    为了加强对粮食保管工作的领导，公社成立了粮食管理委员会，大队成立了分会，生产队成立了小组。由书记挂帅，定期开展检查评比，总结先进经验，及时推广。（附图片）
