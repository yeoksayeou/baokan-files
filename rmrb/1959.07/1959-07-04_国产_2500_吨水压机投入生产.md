Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 3rd. China's first 2,500-ton hydraulic press, designed and manufactured domestically, was officially put into production in Shanghai on the 1st. When the red-hot steel ingot was hoisted onto the hydraulic press's worktable, under the powerful pressure of the hydraulic press, the steel ingot was like kneading dough – it could be lengthened or rounded as desired. In less than a moment, this steel ingot was transformed into a large axle. The hydraulic press also cut off a piece of this thick red steel ingot as smoothly as cutting a steamed bun with a knife.
	This hydraulic press can forge large components weighing more than forty tons, such as the main shaft of 25,000 kW steam turbines and 12,000 kW turbo generators, the keel of 10,000-ton ocean freighters, the crankshaft of large diesel engines, and the rolls of rolling mills. Previously, Shanghai could not forge such large components and had to send them to other places for forging, then transport them back to Shanghai for processing.
	This hydraulic press was designed and manufactured by Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, taking only one year. This hydraulic press is 15.7 meters high and weighs 473 tons. Its largest component, the base, weighs 44 tons, and even a single nut weighs 1 ton and 50 kilograms.

    国产2500吨水压机投入生产
    新华社上海3日电　我国自己设计制造的第一台二千五百吨水压机，1日在上海正式投入生产。当通红的钢锭吊上水压机工作台的时候，钢锭在水压机的强大压力下，像揉面团一样，要长就长，要圆就圆，不到一刻工夫，这根钢锭就变成一根大型轮轴。水压机还把这根粗大的红钢锭切下一块，像刀切馒头似地顺利。
    这台水压机能锻造四十多吨的大部件，如二万五千瓩汽轮机和一万二千瓩汽轮发电机上的主轴，万吨远洋海轮的龙骨，大型柴油机的曲轴，以及轧钢机的轧辊等，都能锻造。以前，这类大型部件上海不能锻造，都要送到外地锻造，然后运回上海加工。
    这台水压机是沈阳重型机器厂设计制造的，前后只花了一年的时间。这台水压机高十五点七公尺，重四百七十三吨。它的最大的一个部件底座重四十四吨，就是一只螺帽也有一吨零五十公斤重。
