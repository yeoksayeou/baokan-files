Construction Sites Should Regularly Clean Up the Site
Beijing's Science Road and Other Construction Sites Mobilize the Masses to Recover On-Site Materials with Remarkable Results

    (Our report) Beijing Fourth Construction Company's Science Road construction site has made cleaning up the construction site and recovering discarded materials an important measure to strengthen material management. A mass on-site cleanup campaign has now been launched. In the past half-month or so, the value of various recycled waste materials has reached more than 48,000 yuan.
    The work of cleaning up the site and recovering discarded materials began in early June. At that time, the leadership proposed to the masses that the construction site should achieve "three cleans" (i.e., clean inside the building, clean the site, and clean the workers' warehouse) and eliminate "three heads" (iron heads, wood heads, and brick heads) on the site. The broad masses immediately took action and launched a conservation campaign. They organized conservation teams, determined to realize the leadership's call.
    In the waste material recovery campaign, the construction site's material department set up several "material recycling stations" on site. The masses adopted the method of "picking up during work, taking away after work, and cleaning up during spare time," contracting by sections and concentrating the collected materials to the "material recycling station." The "material recycling station" has a dedicated person responsible for management. Anything that can be used on the project is immediately allocated for use on the project; anything that cannot be used is immediately sent to the warehouse.
    In half a month or so, the recovered materials included: more than ten tons of steel bar ends, wire ends, etc., 21,000 ceramic tiles, 11,000 facing bricks, more than 370 square meters of strip wood flooring, more than 100 sheets of seven-ply boards, etc. Most of the facing bricks and strip wood flooring have already been used on the project.
    The on-site cleanup has not ended. In order to thoroughly recover all discarded materials, the construction site recently decided that all employees will spend one hour cleaning up every Wednesday and Friday evening.

    (Our report) Beijing First Construction Company has recently vigorously strengthened on-site cleanup work, and has achieved great results in recovering various materials and tools, including 119 tons of steel bar ends; 96 tons of used lead wire; more than 1,850 cubic meters of waste wood; and a considerable amount of templates, fir poles, and various tools.
    The First Construction Company regards cleaning up the site and recovering various materials as an important measure to practice thrift.
    After the cleanup and recovery work was launched, the broad masses of employees showed great enthusiasm. The workers in all the command posts on the construction site organized several surprise cleanups; the youth also organized a conservation commando team; many people did not come and go empty-handed to work, cleaning up while walking; and cadres at all levels worked together with the workers to carry out cleanup and recovery work.
    After about twenty days of cleanup and recovery, the appearance of the site has changed greatly. In the past, the area near the cement warehouse on the construction site was called "Cement Street" by the workers, but it has now been greatly improved. All the various materials that have been collected have been put into the warehouse or sorted out, and the site is more tidy and orderly than before, which is of great benefit to the construction. In the past, people coming and going on the construction site were worried about nails piercing their feet, but now they can walk with confidence and boldness.
    Through the cleanup and recovery work, it has actually played a role in carrying out conservation education. The broad masses of employees have generally improved their awareness of saving materials. Carpenter Yue Guisheng did not pay much attention to conservation in the past, but now, when laying floors, he tries to use small materials and damaged wood on the project as much as possible without affecting the quality and appearance. Cement worker Zhang Fengqi did not take good care of cement paper bags in the past, but on June 11, he sent more than 100 intact bags neatly to the materials station.

### 建筑工地要随时清理现场  北京科学路等工地发动群众回收现场物资成绩显著

    建筑工地要随时清理现场
    北京科学路等工地发动群众回收现场物资成绩显著
    本报讯　北京市第四建筑公司科学路工地把清理施工现场，回收废弃材料作为加强材料管理的一项重要措施。目前一个群众性的现场清理活动已经展开。半个多月以来，回收的各种废弃材料价值已经达到四万八千余元。
    清理现场，回收废弃材料的工作是6月上旬开始的。当时，领导上向群众提出了工地要作到三光（即建筑物内光、现场光、工人仓库光）和现场要消灭三头（铁头、木头、砖头）的号召。广大群众立刻纷纷行动起来展开节约活动。他们组织了节约队，决心实现领导的号召。
    在废弃材料回收活动中，工地材料部门在现场设置了好几个“材料回收站”，群众采取了“上班拣、下班带、业余时间清理”的办法，分地段包干，把收集出来的材料都集中交到“材料回收站”。“材料回收站”上有专人负责管理，凡是能够用到工程上去的，马上分配到工程上使用；确实不能使用的也立刻送入仓库。
    半个多月时间中，回收的材料有：钢筋头、铁丝头等十吨多，磁砖两万一千块，面砖一万一千块，条木地板料三百七十多平方米，七合板一百多张等等。其中面砖和条木地板料已经大部用到工程上。
    现在现场清理并没有结束，为了能够彻底把一切废弃材料收回来，工地上最近决定每星期三、五晚上，全体职工用一小时进行清理。
    本报讯　北京市第一建筑公司最近大力加强现场清理工作，回收各种材料、工具取得了很大成绩，计钢筋头一百一十九吨；用过的铅丝九十六吨；废木料一千八百五十多立方米；还有其他相当数量的模板、杉槁、各种工具。
    第一建筑公司把清理现场、回收各种材料作为厉行节约的一项重要措施。
    清理回收工作开展以后，广大职工表现出极大的热情，工地上所有各个指挥部的工人都组织了几次突击清理；青年们还组织了节约突击队；很多人上班、下班都不空手，一边清理、一边走路；各级干部都和工人一起搞清理回收工作。
    经过二十天左右的清理回收，现场上面目大变。过去工地上洋灰库附近，曾被工人称为“洋灰大街”，现在已经大大改善；所有已经收集起来的各种材料已经入库或者整理就绪，现场上较前整齐、有秩序得多了，这对于施工有很大好处。过去在工地上来来去去的人们担心钉子扎脚，现在可以放心大胆地走路了。
    通过清理回收工作，实际上起到了进行节约教育的作用。广大职工节约用料的自觉性普遍提高了。木工岳桂生过去对于节约不大注意，现在他在铺地板时，把一些小料、残损木料在不影响质量和美观的前提下，尽量用到工程上；洋灰工张凤岐过去对于洋灰纸袋不够爱护，而在6月11日这一天，他把一百多个完好无损的袋子整整齐齐地送到了材料站。
