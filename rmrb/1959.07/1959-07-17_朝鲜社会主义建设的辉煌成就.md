    The Brilliant Achievements of Socialist Construction in Korea

    Good news has arrived from Pyongyang: as of the end of June this year, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has completed its first Five-Year Plan for gross industrial output two and a half years ahead of schedule. This is a glorious achievement made by the Korean people, riding the Chollima, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party. This achievement of the Korean people, who are connected with us by flesh and blood, brings us infinite joy and great encouragement.

    People have seen that the Korean people are brave, hardworking, and good at construction. After liberation in 1945, the Korean people rapidly restored, transformed, and developed the national economy. In 1950, American imperialism launched a barbaric war against the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea, bringing immeasurable disasters and losses to the Korean people. However, with the assistance of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, the Korean people overcame numerous difficulties, victoriously restored the devastated economy, rapidly healed the wounds of war, and made industrial output exceed the pre-war level. From 1954 to 1958, Korean industry grew at an average annual rate of 42%. The output of major industrial products such as electricity, coal, iron, steel, and textiles increased significantly. By the end of 1958, the total output value of state-owned and cooperative industries in Korea was equal to four times that of 1949. Now, Korea has established its own strong industrial base, which can ensure the speed of expanded reproduction of socialist industry and support the water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification of rural areas. This means that it has established its own completely independent and autonomous industry.

    Worthy of special note in industrial construction is the enormous development of the machinery industry. The output value of the machine manufacturing and metal processing industries, taking 1949 before the war as 100, increased to 449% in 1957 and 597% in 1958. In the first half of this year, the production of metal-cutting machine tools in Korea increased 4.4 times compared with the same period last year. As a result of the "machine tools producing machine tools" campaign, 2,474 more machine tools were produced in the first half of this year than originally planned. This is of great significance for Korea's technological revolution.

    The rapid development of socialist construction in Korea is by no means an accident. It is the result of the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung and the selfless labor of the entire Korean people. The Korean Workers' Party has formulated correct lines and policies for socialist economic construction, which is the decisive factor for rapid development. North Korea originally had a very backward light industry but a certain foundation in heavy industry. Although it suffered serious damage during the war, the old foundation could still be used, and there were also raw material resources and a certain technical force. Therefore, the Korean Workers' Party formulated the general line of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while simultaneously developing light industry and agriculture. The Party and the masses of people have formed a close bond of flesh and blood in long-term arduous struggles. The Korean people have a tradition of heroic struggle, and when they become masters of the country and control their own destiny, they can, under the correct leadership of the Workers' Party, give full play to their high revolutionary enthusiasm and soaring drive, and carry out socialist construction victoriously at a rapid pace.

    In order to realize the plan for 1959, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government have adopted a series of major measures: conducting extensive communist education among the working people, raising the political consciousness and sense of ownership of the masses, establishing a communist style of daring to think and act, and maximizing the initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity of the masses. On the other hand, attention is paid to further improving the style of leadership, making the leadership closer to the masses and closer to reality, calling on all cadres to strengthen their mass viewpoint, connect with the masses, promote democracy, and go deep into reality. At the same time, mass technical innovation movements and production increase and economy movements are carried out in all enterprises and units; actively solving the problem of labor shortages; using all methods to realize mechanization (combining indigenous and foreign methods) and automation, improving technical levels and increasing labor productivity; further absorbing women into production, and using labor more rationally. The unprecedentedly rapid development of industrial production in Korea in the first half of this year was achieved on this basis.

    Now, the Korean people are striding forward with heroic steps, striving to complete the production plan for 1959, and continuing to leap forward in order to realize the magnificent prospect task put forward by the Workers' Party to the people of the whole country last September, and strive to build socialism in four or five years.

### 朝鲜社会主义建设的辉煌成就

    朝鲜社会主义建设的辉煌成就
    从平壤传来一个喜讯：截至今年6月底，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经提前两年半完成了第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划。这是跨上千里马的朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导之下取得的辉煌成就。和我们血肉关连的朝鲜人民的这个成就，给我们带来了无限的喜悦，也带来了莫大的鼓舞。
    人们都看到：朝鲜人民是英勇、勤劳又善于建设的。在1945年解放之后，朝鲜人民迅速地恢复、改造和发展了国民经济。1950年，美帝国主义向年青的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动了野蛮的战争，给朝鲜人民带来无可估量的灾难和损失。但是朝鲜人民在以苏联为首的社会主义国家的援助之下，克服了重重困难，胜利地恢复了惨遭破坏的经济，迅速地医治了战争的创伤，使工业产量超过了战前的水平。从1954年到1958年，朝鲜工业每年平均增长42％，主要工业产品如电、煤、铁、钢、纺织品等的产量，都有很大的增长。1958年底，朝鲜国营和合作社工业总产值已等于1949年的四倍。现在，朝鲜已经建立起自己的强有力的工业基地，它能够保证社会主义工业扩大再生产的速度，能够支援农村的水利化、机械化、电气化。这就是说，它已经建立起本国的完全独立自主的工业了。
    工业建设方面值得特别指出的是机械工业的巨大发展。机器制造业和金属加工工业的产值，如以战前1949年为一百，1957年增长到449％，1958年增长到597％。今年上半年，朝鲜的金属切削机床的生产，比去年同期增长了四点四倍。由于开展了“机床生产机床”的运动，今年上半年比原计划多生产了二千四百七十四台机床。这对朝鲜进行技术革命有着巨大的意义。
    朝鲜社会主义建设的高速发展，决不是偶然的现象。它是以金日成同志为首的劳动党中央的正确领导和全体朝鲜人民忘我劳动的结果。朝鲜劳动党制定了正确的社会主义经济建设的路线和政策，是快速发展的决定性因素。朝鲜北半部原有的轻工业很落后，但重工业却有一定的基础，虽然遭受了战争的严重破坏，旧的基础仍可利用，又有原料资源和一定的技术力量，所以朝鲜劳动党制定了优先发展重工业同时发展轻工业和农业的总路线。党和人民群众在长期的艰苦斗争中结成了血肉的联系。朝鲜人民有着英勇斗争的传统，当他们成了国家的主人，掌握了自己命运的时候，他们就能在劳动党的正确领导下，发挥高涨的革命热情和冲天的干劲，以快速的步伐，胜利地进行社会主义建设。
    为了实现1959年的计划，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府采取了一系列的重大措施：在劳动人民群众中广泛进行共产主义教育，提高群众的政治觉悟和主人翁感，树立敢想敢做的共产主义风格，最大限度地发挥群众的主动性、积极性和创造性。另一方面，注意进一步改进领导作风，使领导更加接近群众，接触实际，号召一切干部加强群众观点，联系群众，发扬民主，深入实际。同时，在一切企业单位开展群众性的技术革新运动和增产节约运动；积极解决劳动力不足的问题；用一切方法实现机械化（土洋结合）、自动化，提高技术水平和提高劳动生产率；进一步吸收妇女参加生产，更合理地使用劳动力。朝鲜今年上半年工业生产之所以这样史无前例地迅速发展，就是在这样的基础之上获得的。
    现在，朝鲜人民正以豪迈的步伐，努力完成1959年的生产计划，继续跃进，以便实现劳动党去年9月向全国人民提出的宏伟的前景任务，争取在四、五年内建成社会主义。
