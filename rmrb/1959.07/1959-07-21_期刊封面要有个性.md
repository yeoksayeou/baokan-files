    Journal Covers Should Have Individuality
    Lu Benrui

    The cover design of a journal, like its content, should have its own unique style and characteristics.

    However, browsing the magazine racks in bookstores and newsstands recently, I've noticed that many journal covers have become homogenous and lack individuality. The design of the "Red Flag" magazine cover has been highly praised by readers for its simplicity, elegance, and solemnity, creating its own unique style. This design is very much in line with the "identity" of the publication. However, shortly after "Red Flag" was launched, many theoretical publications and local magazines appeared, with covers that were virtually identical to "Red Flag." Learning from the successful cover designs of other publications is, of course, perfectly acceptable; mutual learning and artistic exchange are to be encouraged. The problem is that these publications are imitating without digesting, slavishly copying, and thus losing their own characteristics, which is worth considering.

    It seems that this has become a trend. I have also seen an increasing number of literary journal cover designs that, regardless of specific conditions, regional characteristics, and target audience, all imitate the cover design of one particular journal. Some local literary journals, whose original cover designs had a bit of local flavor and a distinctive style, are now, in order to keep up with the times, burying this color and style in the uniform design of identical artistic fonts and identical geometric patterns of blocks and strips.

    But then again, not all journal cover designs exhibit this tendency. Many journal cover designs are successful and can be called masterpieces. I would especially like to mention "New Observer." Since its thirteenth issue, both its content and form have been greatly improved. The entire cover design is neither too ornate, leading to gaudiness and vulgarity, nor too elegant, resulting in monotony and carelessness. It can be described as skillfully applying light and heavy makeup, breaking through the old conventions of journal cover design.

    期刊封面要有个性
    陆本瑞
    一本期刊的封面设计，也和它的内容一样，应该有自己独具的风格和特点。
    但是近来在书店杂志架上和报刊摊旁浏览一下，发觉有许多期刊的封面都弄成一个面目，很缺乏个性。“红旗”杂志封面的设计在读者中颇为赞许，设计朴素、大方、庄重，创造了自己独具的风格。这种设计，是很符合这个刊物的“身份”的。但是，“红旗”杂志问世不久，接踵而来的又出现了许多和“红旗”杂志封面一模一样的理论刊物和地方性的杂志。学习其他刊物成功的封面设计，这本来是无可厚非的，彼此互相学习，进行艺术创造的交流也是应该的。问题在于这些刊物不经过融化而生搬硬套地模仿，因此而丢掉了自己的特色，就值得考虑。
    看来这已经成为一种风气。我也见到越来越多的文艺刊物的封面设计不分具体条件、地区特点和读者对象，一律向一种期刊的封面设计看齐。甚至有些地方的文艺刊物，原来的封面设计颇有一点地方色彩和与众不同的风格，而现在为了赶时髦，这种色彩和风格却在雷同的艺术字体，雷同的条条块块的几何图案的统一设计中葬送掉了。
    话又得说回来，并不是所有期刊封面的设计都存在这种倾向，其中也有不少期刊的封面设计是成功的，称得起是佳作。这里特别要提一提“新观察”。这个杂志从第十三期起，不论是内容和形式都作了很大改进。整个封面设计，既没有因华丽而招致繁缛和庸俗，也没有因雅致而失之于单调和草率，称得起是浓妆淡抹巧打扮，突破了期刊封面设计上的旧窠臼。
