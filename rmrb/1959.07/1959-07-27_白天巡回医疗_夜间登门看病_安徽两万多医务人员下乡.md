Xinhua News Agency report: In order to support the summer's great agricultural production push, medical institutions at all levels in Anhui Province have dispatched over 25,000 medical personnel to form numerous rural mobile medical teams, going to various rural areas to carry out medical work.

These medical team members are diligent, hardworking, and display a high degree of initiative in their work. They work and rest with the commune members during the day, providing treatment to them at any time. At night, they also visit patients at their homes, delivering medicine to their doorsteps. The 189 mobile medical teams and 385 groups in Su County generally achieve: bringing needles, medicine, and farm tools; taking responsibility for areas, treatments, prevention, and health education; performing tasks well, having a good service attitude, eating, living, and working with the commune members, and good mutual assistance and cooperation, receiving a warm welcome from the masses. One mobile medical team consisting of 48 medical personnel in Qishibu and Wushilipu communes in Feixi County sets up temporary clinics wherever there are labor teams to ensure timely treatment. When there are no patients, they weed, carry water, and deliver manure with the commune members. Li Hanqing, a 62-year-old traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Guoyang County, voluntarily undertook mobile medical work for a production team, busying himself day and night to see patients and deliver medicine.
