Thousands of Miles of Plateau Singing Together
Zhou Congchun

"Although I don't have wings, I am always around Chairman Mao; although I am not a 'Sharmei' (note), I will sing the praises of the Party's kindness; although I haven't read many books, I can write 'Long Live Chairman Mao, Long Live the Communist Party.'"

This is one of the thousands of folk songs circulating in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Here, whether in the midst of towering mountains or on the boundless grasslands, one can hear the Tibetan people singing with abandon. They sing of free labor, sing of the new life after the democratic reforms, but the most beautiful songs are those that sing the praises of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. The Tibetan people of Ma'erkang County have a folk song that goes like this: "The Communist Party's kindness to me, I can't express it all my life, I will carve it into ten thousand books, and pass it on to future generations."

A poor peasant woman named Da Geqin Chu suffered all kinds of exploitation and oppression from the feudal lords in the past. Her husband was snatched away by the chieftain to be a slave, and her cattle and sheep were also looted. After the democratic reforms, she and her husband were reunited, and she was also given cattle and sheep. Da Geqin Chu sang this song: "Who stole my cattle and sheep? It was the steward, more cunning than a fox. Who snatched away my husband? The evil chieftain was more tyrannical and fierce than a jackal. The People's Liberation Army helped me win back my lost cattle and sheep, and my loved ones returned to my side. I clasp my hands in prayer: Bless you! Great Party."

A herdsman from Ruo'ergai County even used two different dreams to vividly depict the two completely different lives before and after the democratic reforms. He sang: "I had a dream, completely different from the dreams of the past. In a dream last year, I dreamt of the moon and stars, when I woke up, I realized there were countless holes in the tent. This year I had another dream, also dreaming of the moon and stars, when I woke up, I realized the curtains on the glass window hadn't been drawn."

However, the songs of the Tibetan people living on this northwestern Sichuan plateau have not always been so intimate and joyful. In the past, under the cruel rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and feudal lords, production was increasingly declining, and people fled in all directions. Even today, people still remember those sad and indignant songs from that time. A vagrant from Zhuosiqi County once sang:

"The morning glow shines on the meadow by the forest, and I think of my lovely hometown. Why do I think of it? It is the place where I grew up. But I can't meet her, I can't pay the Tusi's rent, so I wander everywhere. The sun sets, and the hillside is full of gold, and I think of my elderly mother. Why do I think of her? I can't forget the kindness of giving birth to me and raising me. But I can't meet her, I can't pay the Tusi's rent, so I wander everywhere. The cuckoo sings sweetly, and I think of the beautiful girl. Why do I think of her? I love her unchanging heart forever. But I can't meet her, I can't pay the Tusi's rent, so I wander everywhere."

Today, with the demise of the old system, these elegies of the old era have gradually been forgotten. They want to sing a thousand, ten thousand more beautiful songs to sing the praises of today's happy life. Just as they themselves sing: "Don't sing about the past, sing about the present, singing about the past makes people feel sour; don't sing about the past, sing about the present, singing about the present makes people feel sweet."

(Note) "Sharmei" is a bird with azure feathers that can sing nine different tunes. The Tibetan people often use it to describe the most beautiful voice. (Attached picture)

    千里高原齐歌唱
    周从纯
    “尽管我没有长翅膀，却时刻围绕在毛主席身旁；尽管我不是‘夏尔美’（注），却会把党的恩情歌唱；尽管我没有读过什么书，却会写万岁毛主席，万岁共产党。”
    这是流传在阿坝藏族自治州的千万首民歌中的一首。这里，不管在丛山峻岭之间，在一望无垠的草原上，都能听到藏族人民纵情的歌唱。他们歌颂自由的劳动，歌颂民主改革后的新生活，但是，那最美的歌曲，却都是歌颂着毛主席和共产党。马尔康县藏族人民，有一首民歌这样唱道：“共产党给我的恩情，一辈子也说不尽，我要刻成千万本书，把它传给后代子孙。”
    有一个贫农妇女大格沁楚，过去受尽了封建主的剥削和压迫，丈夫被头人抢去当了奴隶，牛羊也被抢劫一空。民主改革后，她和丈夫重新团聚在一起，还分得了牛羊。大格沁楚唱出了这样一支歌：“谁抢走了我的牛羊？是那比狐狸还狡猾的管家。谁抢走了我的丈夫？万恶的头人横暴凶残胜过豺狼。解放军帮我夺回了失去的牛羊，亲人也回到了我的身旁。我合指祈祷：祝福你呵！伟大的党。”
    若尔盖县的一个牧民，还曾用两个不同的梦境，生动地描绘了民主改革前后两种完全不同的生活。他唱道：“我做了一个梦，和过去的梦完全不同。去年的一次梦，梦见月亮和星星，醒来时，才知帐篷烂了无数窟窿。今年又做了一个梦，也梦见月亮和星星，醒来时，才知玻璃窗上的窗帘没拉拢。”
    但是，居住在这川西北高原上的藏族人民的歌声，并不是从来就这样亲切和欢畅的。过去在国民党反动派和封建主的残酷统治下，生产日益雕敝，人们四散逃亡。直到今天，人们还记得当时那些哀惋、悲愤的歌曲。绰斯甲县一个流浪者曾经这样歌唱：
    “朝霞射到林边的草坪上，想起了可爱的家乡。为什么要想它呵？它是生长我的地方。可是我不能同她见面，缴不起土司的租子我到处流浪。太阳落坡满坡金黄，想起了年迈的亲娘。为什么要想她呵？生我养我的恩情难忘。可是我不能同她见面，缴不起土司的租子我到处流浪。布谷鸟婉转地歌唱，想到了美丽的姑娘。为什么要想她呵？我爱她永远不变的心肠。可是我不能同她见面，缴不起土司的租子我到处流浪。”
    今天，随着旧制度的灭亡，这些旧时代的哀歌已经逐渐被人遗忘。他们要唱出一千支一万支更美好的歌曲，来歌唱今天的幸福生活。正如他们自己所唱的：“不唱从前唱现在，唱过去使人心里酸；不唱从前唱现在，唱现在令人心里甜。”
    （注）“夏尔美”是一种有天蓝色羽毛、会唱九种不同音调的鸟，藏族人民常常用它来形容最美的歌喉。（附图片）
