Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch. On the afternoon of July 5th, Chiang Kai-shek's Air Force Headquarters and the Central News Agency claimed that on the morning of July 5th, Chiang's air force shot down five People's Liberation Army Air Force aircraft in an air battle over the sea south of Matsu. To clarify the truth, a Xinhua News Agency reporter visited the headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force. The Air Force Headquarters spokesperson explained the facts as follows:

At 7:13 AM on July 5th, four U.S.-made Chiang aircraft, F86s, intruded into the airspace over Tangyu Island, northeast of Nanri Island in Fujian Province. At 7:14 AM, they passed through Pingtan Island and went straight to the Fuzhou area. At 7:21 AM, they encountered our aircraft, which had taken off to respond, over the area of Changle, Mawei, Guantou, and Min'an Town east of Fuzhou. After the battle, Chiang's aircraft fled in panic towards the sea. One of our aircraft, while pursuing a Chiang aircraft that was fleeing at low altitude towards the Minjiang River estuary, crashed into the sea due to the excessive angle and speed of our aircraft's dive and the overly violent maneuver. As for the Central News Agency's propaganda that five of our aircraft were shot down in the sea area south of Matsu, etc., this is purely a habitual trick of the Chiang gang to fabricate war achievements to deceive Chinese and foreign figures. If the Chiang army's war reports had any truth to them over the past thirty years, then the Chinese People's Liberation Army would have ceased to exist long ago, and the Chiang army would not have fled to Taiwan to live a life of lingering existence under the protection of U.S. imperialism.

    我空军司令部澄清真相
    揭穿蒋帮虚构空战“战绩”
    指出蒋帮三十年来一贯捏造战绩欺骗中外人士
    新华社6日讯　7月5日下午蒋介石空军总部和中央社宣称：5日上午蒋空军在马祖以南海面空战中曾击落人民解放军空军飞机五架。为澄清事实真相，新华社记者特走访中国人民解放军空军司令部，承空军司令部发言人说明事实经过如下：
    7月5日七时十三分，美制蒋机F86四架，窜入我福建省南日岛东北塘屿上空，七时十四分经平潭岛后直窜福州地区。七时二十一分在福州以东长乐、马尾、琯头、闽安镇地区上空与起飞应战的我机相遇，经战斗后，蒋机仓皇向海面逃窜。我机一架在追击向闽江口低空逃窜的蒋机时，由于我机俯冲角和速度太大，动作过猛，而失事坠海。至于中央社宣传在马祖以南海域击落我机五架等等，纯属蒋帮虚构战绩欺骗中外人士的惯技，三十多年来如果蒋军的战报有多少真实性的话，那末早已没有了中国人民解放军的存在，蒋军也不会逃到台湾在美帝国主义的庇护下过苟延残喘的生活了。
