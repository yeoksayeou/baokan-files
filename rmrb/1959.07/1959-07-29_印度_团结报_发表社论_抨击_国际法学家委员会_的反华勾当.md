Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 28th - The Indian "Unity Daily" published an editorial today, denouncing the report by the so-called "International Commission of Jurists" which slandered the Chinese government concerning the Tibetan rebellion. The editorial pointed out that this report is "unjust and suffocates justice." In its report published on the 24th, this so-called "International Commission of Jurists" stubbornly portrayed Tibet, a part of China's sacred territory, as "an independent country," fabricated lies such as the Chinese Communists "massacring wantonly in Tibet," and advocated that the United Nations should intervene in the Tibetan rebellion, which had already been quelled and was purely China's internal affair.

The editorial pointed out that "the majority of the members of the International Commission of Jurists are jurists who oppose socialism and oppose those countries friendly to our country." It continued, "Not a single member of the commission asked the Chinese government or the Tibetan people who opposed the landlords. These gentlemen sat in the headquarters of the Commission of Jurists in Geneva, six thousand miles away from Tibet, began to consider the Tibetan issue, and concluded that there were many oppressive things in Tibet. According to their report, their conclusions are based on the talks of Tibetan refugees." The newspaper pointed out that these "refugees" were "the big landlords of Tibet, who wantonly plundered the people there and launched an armed rebellion in an attempt to maintain their exploitative system."

According to a report from Geneva, after the "International Commission of Jurists" published the above-mentioned report slandering China on the 24th, it immediately announced on the 26th the establishment of a so-called "Legal Inquiry Committee on the Tibetan Question," attempting to continue its propaganda slandering China and its activities hostile to China.

The report said that this inquiry committee is chaired by Trikhondas, a senior lawyer of the Indian Supreme Court, who disseminated a large number of remarks slandering and attacking China in Geneva after the Tibetan rebellion. The members of the inquiry committee also include two other Indian "jurists" and some "jurists" from Britain, the Philippines, Thailand, and other countries.

### 印度“团结报”发表社论  抨击“国际法学家委员会”的反华勾当

    印度“团结报”发表社论
    抨击“国际法学家委员会”的反华勾当
    新华社新德里28日电　印度“团结报”今天发表社论，抨击所谓“国际法学家委员会”就西藏叛乱事件发表的诬蔑中国政府的报告。社论指出，这项报告是“不正义的，而且扼杀了正义。”这个所谓“国际法学家委员会在24日发表的报告中，硬把中国神圣领土的一部分——西藏说成是“一个独立国家”，凭空捏造了中国共产党人“在西藏滥施屠杀”等谎言，并且鼓吹由联合国出面对已经被平息的、纯属中国内政的西藏叛乱事件进行干涉。
    社论指出，“国际法学家委员会的大多数成员是反对社会主义、反对那些同我国友好的国家的法学家。”它接着说，“委员会中没有一个成员问一问中国政府或者反对地主的西藏人民。这些绅士们坐在离开西藏六千英里以外的日内瓦法学家委员会总部里，开始考虑西藏问题，并且作出结论说，西藏有许多压迫人的事。从他们的报告看来，他们的结论是以西藏难民的谈话为依据的。”这家报纸指出，这些“难民”是“西藏的大地主，他们肆意掠夺那里的人民。并且发动了武装叛乱，企图维护他们的剥削制度。”
    据日内瓦消息报道，“国际法学家委员会”在24日发表上述诬蔑中国的报告以后，随即在26日宣布成立了一个所谓“西藏问题法律调查委员会”，企图继续进行诬蔑中国的宣传和敌视中国的活动。
    消息说，这个调查委员会由印度最高法院高级律师特里孔达斯担任主席，他在西藏叛乱事件发生以后曾经到日内瓦散播了大量诬蔑和攻击中国的言论。调查委员会的成员中还包括另外两名印度“法学家”和一些英国、菲律宾、泰国等国的“法学家”。
