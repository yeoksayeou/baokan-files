Xinhua News Agency Report: Dalian Railway Hospital is organizing Western doctors to study the main theories of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and on this basis, break away from the circle of one prescription and one remedy to launch a high tide of learning TCM diagnostic and treatment methods throughout the hospital.

In the past six months, Dalian Railway Hospital has used TCM treatment methods or combined TCM and Western medicine to treat more than 200 kinds of diseases, with an effectiveness rate of over 90%. Some diseases that usually require surgery can be treated with TCM without surgery.

At the end of last year, Dalian Railway Hospital launched a mass movement of collecting folk remedies and learning and using hundreds of prescriptions. In two or three months, more than 60,000 folk remedies and proven prescriptions were collected and used clinically with positive results. However, Western doctors did not know the reasons for the effectiveness; at the same time, some proven prescriptions had different effects when used on seemingly identical diseases. In response to this situation, the hospital leadership took measures such as inviting people to give lectures to organize Western doctors to study the main theories of TCM.

In the learning process, various forms that facilitated the integration of TCM and Western medicine were adopted according to the different situations of medical personnel: for example, TCM and Western medicine doctors with relatively high academic accomplishments were organized to form research wards under the principle of mutual learning and cooperation to conduct consultations. Through clinical cooperation, Western doctors gained varying degrees of understanding of TCM diagnostic and treatment principles, and TCM doctors also learned to use Western medicine diagnostic methods such as laboratory tests to help determine diseases. Before TCM and Western medicine consultations, Western doctors prepared the medical records that needed consultation and raised questions for TCM doctors. After the TCM doctors diagnosed the patient, they used diagnostic analysis to explain to the Western doctors. Some wards also invited TCM doctors to jointly study classic TCM works in their spare time, while learning and conducting diagnostic analysis based on case studies. Western doctors in various clinics and districts, combined with their regular work, selected one or several common diseases and visited TCM doctors to learn the diagnostic methods for treating these diseases. At the beginning, Western doctors brought patients to TCM doctors to learn clinically, and then independently prescribed prescriptions, consulting TCM doctors again when encountering difficulties. Some Western doctors mainly relied on self-study, diligently studying TCM theory, and treated patients clinically using diagnostic and treatment methods, with TCM doctors providing regular guidance and solving difficulties. Some Western doctors combined research work, studying the properties and effects of Chinese medicines in the laboratory, and promptly reported the research results to TCM doctors for joint discussion. This method can not only improve the efficacy but also help TCM and Western medicine doctors improve their knowledge and theory of diagnostic and treatment methods.

Recently, the Ministry of Railways held an on-site meeting in Luda to promote this experience. (Attached picture)

### 跳出一方一剂圈子　掌握中医主要理论  大连铁路医院西医学习中医步步深入

    跳出一方一剂圈子　掌握中医主要理论
    大连铁路医院西医学习中医步步深入
    据新华社讯　大连铁路医院组织西医学习中医的主要理论，并在这个基础上，跳出一方一剂的圈子，在全院开展学习中医辨证论治的高潮。
    大连铁路医院半年来运用中医治疗方法或由中、西医合作治疗了二百多种疾病，有效率达到90％以上，通常必须动手术的病症中，有一部分运用中医中药治疗，可以不动手术。
    去年年底，大连铁路医院开展了采风访贤、学百方用百方的群众运动。在两三个月中便搜集了六万多个土方、验方，并在临床应用上收到了效果。但是，西医们都不知收效的道理何在；同时，有一些验方运用在看来相同的病症上，效果相异。针对这种情况，医院的领导上便采取请人讲课等方式，组织西医学习中医的主要理论。
    在学习中，根据医务人员的不同情况，采取了便于中、西医结合的各种形式：如组织了在学术上都比较有修养的中、西医，在互相学习、合作的原则下成立研究病房，进行会诊。经过临床合作，西医对中医辨证论治法则有了不同程度的体会，中医也学习西医用化验诊断方法等帮助判定疾病。在中、西医会诊前，西医把需要会诊的病志整理好并把问题提给中医，中医诊察后用辨证分析向西医讲解，有的病室还在业余时间邀请中医共同学习中医经典著作，一边学一边结合病例进行辨证分析。各门诊、地段的西医们，结合经常工作选定一种或几种多发病，登门请教中医治疗这种病的辨证方法。开始时西医带着病人到中医那里去，临症学习，以后独立处方，遇到疑难再找中医请教。有的西医，以自学为主，苦钻中医理论，在临床上用辨证论治的方法治疗病人，由中医定期去指导及解决疑难。有的西医结合研究工作，在实验室里研究中药性能及作用，将研究所得及时报告中医，共同讨论，这种方法既可提高疗效，又可以帮助中、西医提高辨证论治的知识与理论。
    最近，铁道部在旅大召开现场会议，推广了这一经验。（附图片）
