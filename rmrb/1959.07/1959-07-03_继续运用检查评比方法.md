    Continue to Use Inspection and Appraisal Methods
    Yi Huai
    Last year, the year of the Great Leap Forward, was not only a year of great agricultural harvests, but also a year of great progress in working methods. Inspection and appraisal, grasping both ends to drive the middle, on-site meetings, planting experimental fields, cursory inspections and in-depth investigations, etc., were all effective methods for Party organizations at all levels to lead mass movements. These methods should blossom even more and bear even greater fruit in this year's continued Great Leap Forward.
    Working methods need to adapt to constantly developing and changing new situations. Last year was the Great Leap Forward, this year is the continued Great Leap Forward; last year it was necessary to engage in large-scale mass movements, this year it is still necessary to engage in large-scale mass movements. The Party Central Committee requires everyone to do their work more and more meticulously, to be good at combining soaring enthusiasm with a spirit of scientific analysis, and the masses also demand that we lead and arrange production and life better. Therefore, we must not only continue to use the good methods that were effective last year, but also constantly enrich them, develop them, and make them adapt to this year's new situation and new tasks. The Hengshan County Party Committee's development of last year's effective method of inspection and appraisal competitions, published today, is a very good practice. Adopting such a practice can not only deepen leadership and reduce subjectivism and formalism, but also encourage the enthusiasm of the masses and spread advanced experiences among the masses.
    Any working method or experience is constantly developed and accumulated in practice. If something was not complete and thorough in the past, continuing to use it and develop it can make it thorough, systematic, and full of vitality. Otherwise, it may wither away. Therefore, just like treating other things, we should strive for perfection in working methods and constantly climb to a higher level. The valuable aspect of the Hengshan County Party Committee's development of the inspection and appraisal method lies in continuing to use this method and making some development. This is worthy of being used as a reference by comrades who lead mass movements.

    继续运用检查评比方法
    易槐
    去年，大跃进的一年，不只是生产上大丰收的一年，也是工作方法上大进步的一年。检查评比、抓两头带中间、现场会议、种试验田、走马观花和下马观花，等等，都是各级党组织领导群众运动的行之有效的好方法。这些方法在今年继续大跃进中，应当开更大的花结更大的果。
    工作方法需要适应不断发展变化的新情况。去年是大跃进，今年是继续大跃进；去年要大搞群众运动，今年还要大搞群众运动。党中央要求大家工作要越做越细致，要善于把冲天的干劲和科学分析精神结合起来，群众也要求我们把生产和生活领导安排得更好。因此，我们不但要继续运用去年行之有效的好方法，还要不断地丰富它们，发展它们，使它们适应今年的新形势和新任务。今天发表的衡山县委发展去年行之有效的检查评比竞赛的方法，就是一种很好的作法。采取这样的作法，不但可以使领导深入，减少主观主义和形式主义，还可以鼓舞群众的干劲，传播群众中的先进经验。
    任何一个工作方法或经验，都是在实践中不断发展积累起来的。在过去还没有完整周密的东西，如果继续运用它，发展它，就能够使它周密而系统化，充满生命力。否则，就有可能使它枯萎下去。因此，对待工作方法，也和对待别的事物一样，应当精益求精，不断地更上一层楼。衡山县委发展检查评比方法的可贵之处，就在于继续运用这个方法，并且有所发展。这就值得领导群众运动的同志们作为借镜。
