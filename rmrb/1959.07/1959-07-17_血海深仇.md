    Blood Feud
    This is not a still from a play, but a scene from a real human tragedy: Seventeen-year-old Vietnamese girl Wu Shi Ya is angrily denouncing the bloody crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique.
    Wu Shi Ya is the daughter of a Vietnamese revolutionary martyr. Her father had heroically sacrificed himself in the revolutionary struggle for the liberation of the people. Five years ago, Wu Shi Ya left her hometown in South Vietnam and her beloved mother, and went to North Vietnam. Mother and daughter looked forward to reuniting soon in the joy of national reunification.
    The U.S. imperialist lackey Ngo Dinh Diem clique arrested the girl's mother and imprisoned her in the Phu Loi concentration camp. Last December, the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group poisoned more than a thousand political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp, including Wu Shi Ya's mother.
    Not only Wu Shi Ya and the relatives of the more than a thousand victims were enraged by the bloody atrocities of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, but all 25 million people of Vietnam were enraged. Of course, Wu Shi Ya, who lost her only relative, felt particularly heartbroken.
    On the night of January 25 this year, as in various places in North Vietnam, Haiphong held a demonstration of more than 100,000 people against the Phu Loi atrocities. Wu Shi Ya and her classmates from South Vietnam took to the streets, shouting slogans to protest the bloody atrocities of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique.
    The girl had no tears, she hated with all her heart. Due to excessive excitement, she suddenly fainted during the parade, after shouting slogans. Wu Shi Ya became seriously ill after fainting and is still staying at the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Hospital. Her condition has improved a lot.
    This photo profoundly expresses Wu Shi Ya's inner hatred, which is the blood feud of the entire Vietnamese people against the American aggressors and their lackeys. The slogan against the Phu Loi atrocities hanging on the girl's chest has turned into a raging fire against the heinous rule of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

    血海深仇
    这不是一张剧照，而是一出真实的人间悲剧的一个镜头：十七岁的越南姑娘武氏娅在愤怒地控诉美吴集团的血腥罪行。
    武氏娅是一位越南革命烈士的女儿，父亲已在革命斗争中为人民的解放事业壮烈牺牲。五年以前，武氏娅离开了南越故乡和自己心爱的母亲，到了越南北方。母女俩期望着不久将能在国家统一的欣喜中团聚。
    美帝国主义的走狗吴庭艳集团逮捕了姑娘的母亲，把她关在富利集中营。去年12月，美吴集团毒杀了一千多名富利集中营的政治犯，其中就有武氏娅的母亲。
    为美吴集团血腥暴行所激怒的不仅是武氏娅和一千多名死难者的亲人，被激怒的是全越南二千五百万人民。当然，失去了唯一亲人的武氏娅感到特别痛心。
    今年1月25日夜间，和在北越各地一样，海防市举行了十多万人的反对富利暴行的示威游行。武氏娅同她的从南越来的同学一起走上街头，为抗议美吴集团的血腥暴行振臂高呼。
    姑娘没有眼泪，她切齿痛恨。由于心情过于激愤，她在游行途中、在高呼口号之后突然昏倒。武氏娅在昏倒后不幸大病一场，现在还住在越苏友谊医院，目前病已经好了许多。
    这一张照片深刻地表现了武氏娅内心的仇恨，这是全越人民对美国侵略者和它豢养的走狗的血海深仇。挂在姑娘胸前的反富利暴行的口号，已化成反对美吴集团万恶统治的熊熊烈火。
