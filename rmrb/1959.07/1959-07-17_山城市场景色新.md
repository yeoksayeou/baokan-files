                Morning at the Vegetable Market

As the first rays of dawn break, the large and small vegetable markets in the central district of Chongqing are already bustling with people.

Walking into the largest Dayang溝菜 market in the city, we are first greeted by rows of flower stalls with colorful flowers. There are hundreds of vegetable stalls, all piled high with various fresh vegetables: tomatoes, green peppers, eggplants, vine spinach, pumpkins... there are over fifty varieties. In the open space behind the vegetable stalls are countless piles of vegetables. People can easily buy the fresh vegetables they need at any stall.

Mingled in the noisy voices are the housewives' pleasant laughter and conversations. At one vegetable stall, a gray-haired housewife is chatting with the salesperson while selecting vegetables. "Your vegetables are really plentiful and fresh."

"Aunt Chen, the vegetables in our city are now self-supplied by the suburbs, and they are sent here as soon as they are harvested, so of course they are fresh," the young man selling vegetables said with a proud look. Obviously, this Aunt Chen is already one of his regular customers.

"Your vegetables are washed so clean, these are all very good, but small things like scallions and garlic are still rare," Aunt Chen said, pointing out a small deficiency.

"Many small varieties, spices, and seasonings have already been arranged for," the young man selling vegetables smiled and said, "After a while, you won't find them rare anymore..."

This old lady's words probably represent the general customers' feelings: they are satisfied with the current market's abundance, freshness, and cleanliness of vegetables, but they still have more demands. The Party and the government are meeting these demands. This autumn and winter, 30% of the city's vegetable base area will be set aside for sowing small varieties and spice vegetables, and the variety of vegetables will expand to more than 800. At that time, the vegetable market will have a new look.

Many customers' praises to the salespeople show that the service attitude of the salespeople in this market is satisfactory. Zheng Shuping, a salesperson in the prepared dish department, introduced her work situation to us: every day, in addition to being busy cutting and selling hundreds of servings of prepared dishes (dishes with both meat and vegetables, pre-cut and arranged on a plate) during work hours, she also takes time every day to deliver prepared dishes to the homes of the elderly, weak, pregnant women, and patients in the nearby residential area. Not long ago, she delivered a portion of spareribs to the home of an elderly woman in her nineties living alone. She found that the old woman, who had a bad foot, had difficulty moving around, so she took the spareribs back to her own home to stew them well and then delivered them. Another time, she learned that a pregnant woman, Yan Jiazhen, really wanted to eat meat but lacked pots and pans. Zheng Shuping not only cooked the meat at her own home but also used her own pepper and monosodium glutamate to season it...

                Local Products

As we walked out of the vegetable market with the gradually dispersing crowd, it was nine o'clock in the morning. At this time, the stores on the bustling Jiefang Road began to get busy. We joined the flow of people and entered the largest "March 8th" department store. Here, we paid special attention to carefully examining the trademarks of the goods. Because the day before, the manager of this store told us: since the beginning of summer, the variety of goods here has not only increased from more than 11,000 in the spring to more than 14,000, but the biggest feature is that 80% of the goods are local products. Sure enough, most of these myriad goods are printed with trademarks with distinct local characteristics such as "Mountain City Brand," "Liberation Monument Brand," and "Chongqing Bright Moon Shoe Factory." In the silk, woolen fabric, and clothing department, velvet satin, Huada tweed, Wenfeng ge, Dongfang tweed, and matte spinning are also printed with trademarks of Sichuan local factories. The appearance and increase of these relatively high-end goods indicate that Sichuan's local industry has greatly developed and improved.

Don't think that this is a large department store with all kinds of goods where you can only buy large, complete, and good products. In fact, many unimaginable small things can also be bought. Goods here are sold in small quantities, and you can buy a bunch of thread, a needle, or a foot of yarn. If your child loses a shoe, you can buy a matching one here. In addition, there is a sewing and mending department, a goods rental department, a simple repair department, and so on. This store is almost fully equipped with everything customers need.

              New Developments in the Service Industry

Walking through the streets and alleys, we saw all kinds of service industries. In the urban area alone, nearly 43 repair shops have been newly established recently, and every one of them is thriving.

Particularly noteworthy are the various small service stores run by street residents' production cooperatives. It is understood that there are more than 1,000 simple clothing stores, sewing and mending shops, bathhouses, repair shops, barbershops, and communal stoves. They have become powerful assistants to state-owned service industries and are particularly loved by the people. When a porter is covered in sweat, he can take a comfortable bath in a simple shower room for just a few cents; when a bachelor's clothes are torn or a button falls off, he can conveniently walk into a mending shop, and the shop owner will sew it for him in a moment... Many original service industries have also tried their best to add various new and convenient varieties and service items for customers. The photography industry alone has added more than 200 varieties in recent years.

              Cold Drinks and Fragrant Tea Keep Guests Busy

It is not yet the hottest season in Chongqing, but the city's cold drink shops and teahouses have greatly increased in the past ten days. The number of cold drink shops in the central district alone has doubled compared to ten days ago.

Every street has many cold drink shops and teahouses. When pedestrians get hot, entering a cold drink shop immediately gives them a cool and comfortable feeling. The supply of cold drinks is also extremely rich, with up to thirteen or fourteen varieties. New varieties have also added frozen mung bean soup and frozen soy milk, etc. For cold cakes alone, the market supply in May and June was more than 7 million, so even workers on suburban construction sites dozens of miles away can eat all kinds of cold cakes.

The teahouses in Mountain City are even more distinctive. There are more than 140 teahouses in the city, where people can not only drink tea and cool off but also listen to folk artists singing Sichuan opera, telling stories, singing folk art, and telling comic dialogues, enjoying beneficial cultural life. Some teahouses also have candy and pastry sections, selling cold wine, marinated dishes, dan dan noodles, and selling movie and theater tickets, envelopes, and stationery on consignment.

We saw many bathhouses using spare beds to add a special "nap teahouse." Guests from the suburbs who are hot and tired at noon can go to the extra-shaded teahouse for just a dime, brew a cup of Chongqing Tuo tea, and sleep sweetly for two or three hours.

Many of the scenes we saw show that Chongqing's market is getting better day by day. This is by no means accidental. In the past few months, the various major measures taken by Chongqing's party and government leaders, and the great efforts made by commercial workers, have made this year's market greatly active. Recently, party and government leaders have made comprehensive and detailed arrangements for the autumn and winter markets. It is foreseeable that the market in the second half of the year will show a newer and better face to the people. (Attached pictures)

    山城市场景色
    新本报记者　胡明俊　平兰
                菜市的早晨
    天刚微露晨曦，重庆市中区的大小菜市，已经充满熙熙攘攘的人群。
    走进全市最大的大阳沟菜市场，首先笑迎我们的，是两排花摊上五色缤纷的鲜花。菜摊子数以百计，都堆满着各种新鲜蔬菜，番茄、青椒、茄子、藤菜、南瓜……花色品种足有五十多个。菜摊后边的空地上，堆着无数的菜堆。人们随便到一个摊子，很快就能便买好要买的鲜菜。
    在闹哄哄的人声中，夹杂着主妇们愉快的笑声和谈话声。一家菜摊上，一位头发灰白的主妇正边选菜，边和营业员聊天。“这向你们的菜，真是又多又新鲜。”
    “陈大娘，现在本市的菜都是由郊区生产自给，出土便送来这里，当然新鲜罗。”卖菜的小伙子露出得意的神情说。显然，这位陈大娘已经是他的老顾主了。
    “你们的菜淘洗得真干净，这些都很好，只是小葱小蒜一类的小东西还稀罕。”陈大娘美中不足地说。
    “许多小品种、香料、调味品，都早作了安排哪。”卖菜的小伙子笑道：“再过些时，你便不稀罕了……”
    这位老太太的话，大概可以代表一般顾客们的心意：对当前市场蔬菜的充足、新鲜、洁净是满意的，但是还有更多的要求。党和政府正在满足人们这些要求。今年秋冬季，全市蔬菜基地将划出30％的面积播种小品种和香料蔬菜，菜的花色品种将扩大到八百多个。那时，蔬菜市场将会另有一番新气象。
    许多顾客给予营业员的各种表扬，显示了这座市场营业员们的服务态度是令人满意的。盘菜部的营业员郑淑平向我们介绍了她的工作情况：每天，她除了工作时间忙着切卖几百份盘菜（一盘一盘配好切好的有肉有菜的荤菜）以外，为了照顾附近居民区的老弱、孕妇、病人，她还天天抽空把盘菜送到这些人的家里。不久以前，她把一份排骨送到一位九十多岁的孤老太婆家里。当时她发现这位坏了脚的老人行动很艰难，她便把排骨带回自己家里煨好，又送了来。又一次，她了解到孕妇颜家贞很想吃肉，可是缺锅少灶，郑淑平不但在自己家里把肉做好，还把自己家的胡椒，味精用来调味。……
                本地的产品
    我们随着渐渐星散的人群走出菜市时，正是上午九点钟。这时，繁华的解放路上的各家商店，开始忙碌起来。我们夹在人流中，进入了最大的“三八”百货商店。在这里，我们特别注意细看商品的商标。因为前一天，这家商店的经理告诉我们：入夏以来，这里的商品种类不但由春季的一万一千多种增加到一万四千多种，最大的特点是，80％的商品都是本地的产品。果然，这万类商品，绝大多数都印着“山城牌”、“解放碑牌”、“重庆明月鞋厂”等有鲜明地方特色的商标。在丝绸呢绒服装部，绒面缎、华大呢、文峰葛、东方呢、无光纺等也都印着四川地方工厂的商标。这些比较高级的商品的出现和增多，标志着四川地方工业有了很大的发展和提高。
    别以为这儿是万种商品的大商店，只能买到大的、全的、好的商品，其实，许多难以想到的细小东西也都能买到。这儿的商品分零出售，可以买到一束线、一根针、一尺毛线。如果你的孩子掉了一只鞋，你可以在这里买一只配上。另外，这里还设有缝补洗衣部、商品出租部、简易修配部，等等。顾客所需要的，这个商店差不多全备齐了。
              服务行业新事多
    穿过大街小巷，我们看到形形色色的服务行业。单是城区的各种修理店，近来便增设了四十三家，家家生意兴隆。
    特别引人注意的，是街道居民生产合作社举办的各种小服务店。据了解，简易缝衣店、缝补洗衣店、浴室、修理店、理发室、老虎灶，就有一千多家，它们成了国营服务行业的强大助手，是人民特别喜爱的地方。当一个搬运工人淌了一身大汗，只要花几分钱，便可以在简易淋浴室洗个舒服的澡；当一个单身汉衣衫破了、扣子掉了，顺便走进缝补店，店主人一会儿便给他缝好……。许多原有的服务行业，还千方百计地增设了各种新颖的便利顾客的花色品种和服务项目。单是照相业近年来便增加了二百多个花色品种。
              冷饮香茶迎客忙
    重庆，现在还没有到酷热的季节，可是，全市的冷饮店、茶馆，近十天来已经大大增加了。单是市中区的冷饮店，就比十天前增加了一倍。
    每一条街道都有不少冷饮店、茶馆。行人走热了，进入冷饮店，顿然给人一种凉爽舒适的感觉。冷饮供应也极丰富，有多到十三、四种的。新品种中还添了冰冻绿豆汤和冰冻豆浆等等。仅仅是冷糕一种，5、6月份的上市量就有七百多万只，那怕在几十里以外的郊区工地，工人们也能吃到各色冷糕。
    山城的茶馆更有特色。全市有一百四十多家茶馆，人们不仅可以在里边喝茶乘凉，还可以听到民间艺人唱川戏、讲评书、唱曲艺、说相声，享受有益的文化生活。有些茶馆还附设糖果点心部，出售冷酒、卤菜、担担面，代售影剧票和信封信笺。
    我们看到许多浴室，利用多余床铺，增设了一种特别的“午睡茶座”。郊外来的客人，中午走热了，疲倦了，只花一角钱，就可以到那格外阴凉的茶座内，泡一杯重庆沱茶，甜睡二、三小时。
    我们看到的许多情景，都显示着重庆的市场正一天比一天好。这决不是偶然的。几个月来，重庆市的党政领导部门采取的各种重大措施，商业职工付出的巨大努力，使得今年市场大为活跃。最近，党政领导部门对秋冬市场又作了全面细致的安排。可以预料，下半年的市场，将会在人们面前展现更新更好的面貌。（附图片）
