Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 30th. June: On June 30th, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Fujian front troops released three captured Kuomintang (KMT) Air Force pilots. They were Zhang Naijun, second lieutenant pilot from the KMT Air Force's Fifth Group; Hua Wulin, captain pilot from the Twentieth Group; and Liu Chengli, captain co-pilot.

　　These three former KMT Air Force personnel were shot down and captured during their harassment activities over the Fujian front in September and October last year. After being captured, they received lenient treatment from the PLA. Considering that they still have relatives in Taiwan, the PLA, respecting their wishes, released them back to Kinmen.
