Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 18th: The Cuban People's Socialist Party issued a statement on the resolution of the crisis caused by President Urrutia's rebellion, stating that Urrutia's departure and the assumption of the presidency by Dorticos, who is very much in agreement with Castro, have consolidated the Cuban revolution and created favorable conditions for the advancement of the Cuban revolution, helping to prevent attacks on Cuba by domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces.

The statement said that Urrutia's rebellion was driven by personal self-interest and hatred of the revolution. This traitor also waved the banner of anti-communism, and his actions were a continuation of the betrayal initiated by Diaz Lanz.

The statement pointed out that Urrutia's rebellion once again shows that anti-communism is an excuse and a tool and slogan for traitors, counter-revolutionaries, Mujalists (labor union bosses during the dictatorship), and imperialist agents to attack the revolution and carry out blackmail.

The statement said that thanks to Castro's exposure, this rebellion was quickly crushed, disrupting the insidious plan centered on Urrutia, and dealing a heavy blow to the ongoing anti-Cuban conspiracy. This timely exposure also made it impossible for this president to disguise himself as a victim, impossible to gain political capital for himself based on the revolutionary cause, and impossible for him to become a center for organizing counter-revolutionary political movements under the guise of democracy and revolution.

The statement said that the former president used his power to obstruct revolutionary laws, undermine cabinet actions, hinder constructive initiatives and goals, and finally attack government policies, exonerate traitors, and himself engage in rebellion. The removal of such a president is a victory and progress for the revolution.

The statement then said that the appointment of Dr. Osvaldo Dorticos Torrado, the Minister of Revolutionary Laws with a history of struggle and very much in agreement with Fidel Castro, as president due to Urrutia's departure, has created more favorable conditions for the advancement of the revolutionary cause, and will help Cuba prevent external attacks and prevent the conspiracies of Batista elements, Trujillo elements, Somoza elements, and imperialist elements, who are frantically preparing to use violence, assassination, crime, and armed action.

The People's Socialist Party's statement concluded by congratulating Castro, the Cuban government, and the leaders of the Rebel Army, congratulating the Cuban people who stand with the revolution and Castro and maintain a firm position, and at the same time calling on the Cuban people to maintain revolutionary vigilance in order to continue to expose conspirators and traitors before they achieve their evil and bloody goals; strengthen the unity and cooperation of all patriotic forces in order to better and more fully support the revolutionary government and the entire revolutionary cause, more effectively defend Cuba's sovereign integrity, and enable the Cuban revolution to continue to advance under Castro's leadership.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 19th: The Cuban government cabinet, under the chairmanship of the new President Osvaldo Dorticos, held a meeting on the evening of the 18th and passed a resolution requesting Castro to continue to serve as Prime Minister.

The resolution of the cabinet meeting pointed out that in view of the President's decision not to accept Castro's request to resign from the post of Prime Minister and has notified the plenary session of the cabinet, the cabinet has decided to advise Castro to continue to serve in his post in order to maintain the leadership of this political leader over the government.

    古巴人民社会党发表声明
    粉碎叛变阴谋巩固了古巴革命
    古巴内阁通过决议要求卡斯特罗留任总理
    新华社哈瓦那18日电　古巴人民社会党就乌鲁蒂亚总统叛变所引起的危机的解决发表声明说，乌鲁蒂亚的下台和由同卡斯特罗非常一致的多尔蒂科斯担任总统，巩固了古巴的革命，并为古巴革命向前发展创造了有利的条件，有助于防止内外反革命势力对古巴的进攻。
    声明说，乌鲁蒂亚的叛变是由于受个人私利和对革命的仇恨所驱使。这个叛徒也挂着反共的幌子，他的行动是迪亚斯·兰斯所开始的背叛活动的继续。
    声明指出，乌鲁蒂亚的叛变再一次表明，反共是叛徒、反革命分子、穆哈尔分子（独裁统治时期的工贼头目）和帝国主义代理人进攻革命的借口和进行讹诈的工具和口号。
    声明说，由于卡斯特罗的揭发，迅速粉碎了这个叛变，打乱了以乌鲁蒂亚为中心的奸诈的计划，给了正在进行的反古巴的阴险阴谋以沉重的打击。这种及时的揭发还使得这个总统不可能把自己打扮成牺牲者，不可能再靠革命事业为自己捞得政治资本，他也不可能以民主和革命作幌子而实际上变成组织反革命的政治运动的中心。
    声明说，前总统利用职权阻挠革命法律，破坏内阁行动，阻挠建设性的倡议和目的，最后还攻击政府政策，为叛徒开脱并且自己也实行叛变。撤销这样一个总统，是革命的胜利和进展。
    声明接着说，由于乌鲁蒂亚下台而任命了具有斗争历史以及同菲德尔·卡斯特罗非常一致的革命法律部部长奥斯瓦耳多·多尔蒂科斯·托拉多博士为总统，就为革命事业向前发展创造了更加优越的条件，就有助于古巴防范外部进攻和防范巴蒂斯塔分子、特鲁希略分子、索摩查分子和帝国主义分子的阴谋，这些阴谋分子正狂热地准备使用暴力、暗杀、犯罪和武装行动。
    人民社会党的声明最后向卡斯特罗、古巴政府和起义军领袖表示祝贺，向同革命和卡斯特罗站在一起、保持坚定立场的古巴人民表示祝贺，同时号召古巴人民保持革命警惕性，以便在阴谋家和叛徒实现他们罪恶和血腥的目的之前继续揭发他们；加强一切爱国力量的团结和合作，以便更好和更多地支援革命政府和整个革命事业，更有效地保卫古巴的主权完整，使古巴革命在卡斯特罗的领导下继续向前发展。
    新华社哈瓦那19日电　古巴政府内阁在新总统奥斯瓦耳多·多尔蒂科斯的主持下，在18日晚上举行会议，通过决议要求卡斯特罗继续担任总理的职务。
    内阁会议的决议指出，鉴于总统决定不接受卡斯特罗辞去总理职务的要求，并已通知内阁全体会议，因此内阁决定劝告卡斯特罗继续担任他的职务，以便保持这位政治领袖对政府的领导。（附图片）
