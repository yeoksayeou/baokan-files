Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 10th (via TASS): Glyzos said to a special correspondent of the German News Agency in court: "I believe that the trial against us is closely related to the Greek atomic armament plan. I will talk about this in detail during the trial." Glyzos said he was very pleased that a powerful movement to free them had been launched around the world. The issue is not primarily about me personally, but about freedom, democracy and peace. He said that the accusations against them are based on untruthful circumstances and are fabricated. Therefore, defending us is upholding justice.
    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 10th: The imprisoned Glyzos is now in high spirits and in good mood. The editorial department of the Polish "Youth Banner" newspaper telephoned Glyzos' defense lawyer, Ilias Iliou, on the 9th. Iliou reported on the phone about the current situation of the Greek national hero who is being illegally tried by the Greek authorities. The lawyer also said that Glyzos asked to convey his gratitude to all those who are trying to save him.

    格列索斯在法庭上对记者说
    保卫我们就是伸张正义
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社柏林9日讯：格列索斯在法庭上对德意志通讯社特派记者说：“我认为，对我们的审判是与希腊原子武装计划紧密相关的，在审判过程中我还要详细谈到这点。”格列索斯说，他很高兴世界各地展开了争取释放他们的强大运动。问题首先不是关系到我个人，而是关系到自由，民主与和平。他说，对我们的控告是根据不真实的情况的，它是虚构的。所以，保卫我们，也就是伸张正义。
    新华社华沙10日电　身受监禁的格列索斯现在精神饱满，心情良好。波兰“青年旗帜报”编辑部9日打电话给格列索斯的辩护律师伊利亚斯·伊留，伊留在电话中报告了这位正在受到希腊当局非法审讯的希腊民族英雄的近况。这位律师还说，格列索斯要求转达他对一切力求拯救他的人的感谢。
