Short commentary:

    An army always needs to rest and reorganize after a battle. Necessary rest is for winning even greater victories next time. No army can continuously fight one battle after another and still achieve final victory. Although the situation in schools is not exactly the same as in the military, to truly guarantee the gradual improvement of teaching quality, it is imperative to ensure that the vast majority of teachers and students get a good rest during the vacation. The relationship between resting well and teaching/learning well is similar to the relationship between rest and winning battles. Since the victory of the educational revolution last year, ensuring that teachers and students can rest well during this summer vacation will also guarantee the victorious achievements of the educational revolution and achieve even greater victories in improving teaching quality in the new academic year. This is like an army that has been reorganized, ready to win every battle.
    At present, educational administrative departments in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places have been or are actively taking measures to arrange the summer vacation life of teachers and students in various types of schools, resolutely ensuring that teachers and students can get one month or one and a half months of rest. During the holidays in Beijing, schools and departments generally do not assign teaching or scientific research work to teachers, so that teachers can fully rest and have a certain amount of time to prepare for the new academic year; except for assigning a certain amount of homework to students, they are not organized to participate in production labor and other activities. The production internships originally planned by engineering colleges to take up the summer vacation have been postponed, or a month of leave will be made up after the internship. The Shanghai Education Trade Union and various schools have formulated plans and made arrangements to allow teachers to voluntarily participate in travel or visits, or to attend short-term professional training classes. Beijing, Shanghai, and other places will prepare conditions for cultural and recreational activities for teachers and students during the holidays. In this way, a rich, colorful, and meaningful summer vacation life will be launched in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places.
    Some people believe that in order to improve teaching quality and strengthen preparation work, many tasks should be arranged during the vacation, such as organizing teacher training courses, holding meetings to summarize work, and new student enrollment work, and so on. Of course, these tasks should be done. However, they cannot all be done during the holidays; even if they have to be done, they should be strictly controlled within a certain period of time. Otherwise, occupying too much vacation time will lose the meaning of the vacation. An army that is well-trained in peacetime can also fight well if there is an unexpected battle, but its merit lies not in this battle, but in the rest and reorganization it gets in peacetime. If a school is always like a tightly wound spring, never relaxing, and with no room for maneuver, can it make teaching quality rise steadily? Obviously impossible. Therefore, during the holidays, teachers and students must have ample time for personal free activities and rest. If teachers can be allowed to voluntarily participate in collective activities such as travel, visits, and so on during the holidays, and freely exchange teaching opinions and experiences in these collective activities, wouldn't that also be able to meet the conditions for preparing teaching for the new academic year?
    Party committees and education administrative departments in various places, party and administrative leading cadres of various schools, as well as the vast majority of teachers, students, and staff, must adopt practical and reliable methods to ensure that they truly rest well during the holidays. It can be expected that this year's summer vacation will be a pleasant vacation, and also a vacation that heralds a greater harvest in teaching.

### 保证师生在假期好好休息

    保证师生在假期好好休息
    军队打过仗，总要休整。必要的休整，是为了下次打更大的胜仗。没有一支军队能够一个战役接连一个战役地不断打下去，而能最后取得胜利的。学校的情况，虽然与军队不大相同，但是，要真正保证教学质量逐步提高，就必须切实保证广大师生在假期很好休息。休息好和教好、学好的关系，类似休整和打胜仗的关系。去年以来，教育大革命取得胜利之后，今年暑假期间，保证师生能够休息好，也就能够保证教育革命的胜利成果，并在新学年中，取得提高教学质量的更大胜利。这就像经过休整的军队一样，能够旗开得胜。
    现在，北京、上海等地的教育行政部门，已经或正在积极采取措施，安排各级各类学校师生的暑期生活，坚决保证教师和学生都能够得到一个月或一个半月的休息。北京市在放假期间，各校各系一般不给教师布置教学或科学研究工作，好让教师们充分休息、有一定时间为新学年备课；对学生除给以一定的假期作业外，也不组织参加生产劳动等活动。工科院校原计划占用暑假进行生产实习的，已经推迟，或者在实习后补假一个月。上海市教育工会和各学校都已订立计划，作了布置，让教师们根据自愿参加旅行或参观访问，或参加短期业务进修班。北京、上海等地都将在假期中，为师生们准备文化娱乐活动的条件。这样，一个丰富多采、满有意义的暑期生活将在北京、上海等地开展起来。
    有人认为：正是为了提高教学质量，加强准备工作，所以要在假期安排许多工作，如组织教师进修班、开会总结工作、新生招考工作，等等。当然这些工作都是应当做的。但是，不能都放在假期去做；即使非做不可，也应当严格控制在一定的时间以内。否则，占用假期时间过多，就会失去假期的意义。一支平时训练有素的军队，一旦发生了意外的战斗，也可以打得很好，但其功不在这次战斗，而在平时的休整。如果一个学校总像上紧了的弦一样，永不松弛，丝毫没有回旋余地，是不是能使教学质量步步上升呢？显然是不可能的。所以，在假期中，必须让师生们有充分的个人自由活动和休息的时间。如果能够在假期中让教师们自愿参加一些旅行、参观、访问等的集体活动，在这些集体活动中，自由地交换教学意见，交流教学经验，等等，不也是能够达到为新学年准备教学的条件的吗？
    各地党委和教育行政部门，各个学校的党和行政领导干部，以及广大师生员工，都要采取切实可靠的方法，保证在假期中真正休息好。可以预期，今年的暑假将是一个愉快的假期，也是一个预示着教学更大丰收的假期。
