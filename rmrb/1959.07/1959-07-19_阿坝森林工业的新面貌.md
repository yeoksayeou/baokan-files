    Reported here: Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which boasts abundant forest resources, has produced more than 2.5 million cubic meters of timber since 1951, supporting the socialist construction of the motherland. This timber accounts for more than half of the total timber production in Sichuan Province. If all of it were used for railroad ties, it could lay down more than twenty Chengdu-Chongqing railways. It not only supplies the construction needs of Sichuan Province but also supports many provinces and cities in Beijing, Shanghai, and the Northwest and Central South regions.
    The Aba Autonomous Prefecture is a major forest industry base in Sichuan Province. The forest area is approximately 2.2 million hectares, with a total timber reserve of 250 million cubic meters. Before liberation, the reactionary rulers only cared about indiscriminate logging. The vast forest areas were unmanaged, and the forest resources were not fully utilized. The degree of timber decay was as high as 50% or more. In 1951, the People's Government established the first forest industry bureau here, and began to develop the forest area. Only then did a brand new face appear in the autonomous prefecture's forest industry. Now, the entire prefecture has established seven large-scale forest industry bureaus and two timber waterway transportation offices in places like Ma'erkang and Heishui, with a total of more than 59,000 employees. They vigorously promote advanced experience and advanced tools for logging at home and abroad, and carry out planned and rational logging. Last year, the workers launched a technical innovation movement, creating a high-yield record of 117 cubic meters of logs per day. They also vigorously realized the aerial cableway of timber transportation, and the timber logging volume therefore increased rapidly. In 1952, the prefecture only logged more than 80,000 cubic meters of timber, but last year it jumped to more than 1.08 million cubic meters. This year, the prefecture's timber production plan has been further increased to more than 1.8 million cubic meters.
    In the past two years, the autonomous prefecture's forest industry departments have also carried out comprehensive utilization of timber, and established a large number of waste material processing plants, bakelite factories, forest chemical plants, etc. The forest chemical plant built by the West Sichuan Forest Industry Bureau alone has twenty-three plants, producing twenty-six kinds of industrial raw materials such as vinegar stone, bakelite, rayon, and aromatic oil.
    While developing the forest area, the autonomous prefecture has vigorously strengthened forest protection, afforestation, and seedling cultivation. Sixteen state-owned forest farms and five state-owned horticultural farms have been established, managing 68% of the prefecture's forest area. Large-scale afforestation and seedling cultivation movements have also been carried out in barren mountains and wasteland. As of now, the entire prefecture has afforested more than 300,000 mu, of which economic forests account for more than 50%.

    阿坝森林工业的新面貌
    本报讯　拥有丰富森林资源的阿坝藏族自治州，从1951年以来，已经生产了二百五十多万立方米木材，支援祖国社会主义建设。这些木材占四川省木材总产量一半以上，若全部用作铁路枕木，可铺设成渝铁路二十来条。它们不仅供应四川省建设需要，还支援了北京、上海和西北、中南地区许多省、市。
    阿坝自治州是四川省主要森林工业基地。森林面积约二百二十万公顷，木材总蓄积量达二亿五千万立方米。解放前，反动统治者只管滥砍乱伐，广大林区无人管理，森林资源得不到充分利用，林木腐朽程度最高竟达50％以上。1951年，人民政府在这里建立了第一个森林工业局，着手开发林区，自治州森林工业才出现了崭新面貌。现在，全州已在马尔康、黑水等地建立了七个大型森工局，两个木材水运处，共有职工五万九千多人。他们大力推行国内外采伐工作的先进经验和先进工具，进行有计划地合理地采伐。去年，职工们更开展了技术革新运动，创造了日采原木一百一十七立方米的高产纪录，并大力实现运材索道化，木材采伐量因而迅速上升。1952年，全州只采伐木材八万多立方米，去年，却跃升到一百零八万多立方米。今年，全州木材生产计划更增加到一百八十万立方米以上。
    近两年来，自治州森林工业部门还开展了木材综合利用，建立了大批废材加工厂、烤胶厂、林产化工厂等。仅川西森林工业局建成的林产化工厂就有二十三个，生产了醋石、烤胶、人造纤维、芳香油等二十六种工业原料。
    在开发林区同时，自治州大力加强了护林、造林和育苗工作。建立了十六个国营林场和五个国营园艺场，经营管理的森林面积占全州森林面积的68％；并在荒山荒地开展了大规模的造林育苗运动，截至目前止，全州共已造林三十多万亩，其中经济林木在50％以上。
