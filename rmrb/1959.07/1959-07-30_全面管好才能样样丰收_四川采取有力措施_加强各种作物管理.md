　　Comprehensive Management for All-Round Bumper Harvest

　　Sichuan Takes Forceful Measures to Strengthen the Management of Various Crops

　　(Our newspaper, Chengdu, July 29th) In strengthening the field management of large spring crops (i.e., autumn-ripening crops), Sichuan Province is educating the masses to establish a viewpoint of comprehensive bumper harvests, taking into account all factors, making overall arrangements, grasping both grain crops and cash crops, grasping both major crops and minor crops, and grasping both paddy fields and dry land crops, striving for all-round bumper harvests.

　　This year, in the sowing and transplanting of large spring crops, Sichuan Province, based on the principle of combining self-sufficiency and commodity production, and the principle of combining large-area planting for multiple harvests and a portion of land with less planting for high yield and multiple harvests, vigorously expanded the planting area of cash crops and many crops such as miscellaneous grains and medicinal materials. Various localities have also tried every possible means to use the edges of fields to increase the planting of a large number of minor cash crops and melons, beans, and vegetables. According to incomplete statistics from nine special districts (cities) alone, the increased planting area of ​​grain and vegetables reached 890,000 mu. In order to ensure that these crops are not only planted well but also managed well, various localities have strengthened overall leadership from the very beginning of field management. In particular, after some places discovered that the masses had a phenomenon of neglecting cash crops, dry land crops (miscellaneous grains), and minor crops, they paid more attention to this issue. At present, various crops are growing very well throughout the province. Mid-season rice has been cultivated and topdressed once, and half of it has been cultivated a second time; one-third of the corn has also been cultivated twice, and sweet potatoes have been topdressed while being planted; in terms of minor crops such as peanuts, sesame, and beans, various localities have carried out management on time.

　　Local experiences have proven that the key to comprehensively managing various crops lies in resolving various incorrect understandings among the masses and establishing a viewpoint of comprehensive bumper harvests. Some people believe: “If we don’t grow grain well, we won’t have anything to eat, and whatever else we harvest is just extra,” “Grain is the marshal, we just need to grow grain well,” “I would rather plant ten mu of paddy fields (rice) than one mu of dry land (miscellaneous grains),” and “labor is too tight and we can’t manage everything,” etc. Some of these views belong to the realm of understanding, and some lack methods. For this reason, many localities first carried out large-scale publicity work to explain the significance of comprehensive bumper harvests to the masses. Secondly, in response to different ideological situations, they conducted investigations of crops, measures, and labor, mobilized the masses to calculate various accounts, and solved ideological problems and specific problems at the same time. The effect of doing so is very good. Some communes in Huacheng District, Bazhong County, did not pay much attention to minor cash crops in the past. They immediately mobilized the masses to calculate three accounts: the account of cash crops supporting national construction, the account of improving people's economic lives, and the account of increasing commune income. At the same time, they held on-site meetings in advanced communes, and a high tide of managing cash crops was immediately set off throughout the district.

　　Reasonable allocation of labor is the central link of comprehensive management. The general practice in various localities is to divide battle lines for major cash crops and miscellaneous grains, and establish professional teams based on the technical expertise of the commune members. For some minor crops, various flexible methods are adopted according to local conditions, the amount of labor, and the crop situation. At the same time, a method combining professional teams and mass movements is used to solve the needs of intensive management. For example, before June, Naxi County did not establish professional teams, and 30% of the county's cotton, peanuts, and sesame were growing poorly. After organizing professional team management, they basically achieved full stands and strong seedlings in less than ten days. Xiquan Commune in Tongliang County has taken three measures to strengthen the management of minor crops: (1) For those with strong technical requirements and small areas, assign fixed personnel for management; (2) For those with general technical requirements that are not high, implement short-term arrangements and flexible labor transfer according to the order of planting major and minor crops; (3) During the peak period of the three types of seedlings, everyone works together. After implementing this method, the commune's medicinal materials and minor miscellaneous grain crops are growing very well. For crops additionally planted on scattered land, some communes in Dazhou County adopted the method of local matching and handed them over to the professional teams of nearby major field crops for joint management. When the major fields are cultivated, they also cultivated the nearby additionally planted crops; if they cannot be combined for management, the planting teams and management areas will uniformly arrange time and labor for management. In addition to arranging a certain amount of labor to manage the crops additionally planted on scattered land, Jinping Commune in Pingshan County also specifically allocates half a day each week for commune members to manage their own scattered crops.

　　In order to solve the fertilizer needed for comprehensive management, various localities have made reasonable allocations in the use of fertilizer and vigorously mobilized the masses to accumulate and produce fertilizer in order to fundamentally solve the problem of rapidly increasing fertilizer demand. For more than a month, various localities have seized the opportunity of lush summer vegetation to vigorously accumulate and produce green manure, and at the same time, tried every possible means to increase the output and improve the quality of soil-made fertilizer to broaden the sources of fertilizer. Many special districts such as Mianyang and Nanchong have launched several intensive fertilizer accumulation campaigns since June, and some areas have also begun to implement the method of combining fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer production, and fertilizer application, handing over the task of accumulating and producing fertilizer to the field management professional teams, and determining the quantity, quality, and time according to the needs of crops, fields, and growth stages, thus better satisfying the different needs of various crops.

### 全面管好才能样样丰收  四川采取有力措施　加强各种作物管理

    全面管好才能样样丰收
    四川采取有力措施　加强各种作物管理
    本报成都29日电　四川省在加强大春作物（即秋熟作物）田间管理中，教育群众树立全面丰收观点，统筹兼顾，全面安排，既抓粮食作物又抓经济作物，既抓大宗作物又抓小宗作物，既抓水田又抓旱地作物，力争样样丰收。
    今年，四川省在播种和栽插大春作物中，根据自给性和商品性生产并举的方针，以及大面积多种多收和一部分土地少种高产多收相结合的方针，大力扩大了经济作物和杂粮、药材等许多作物的种植面积；各地还千方百计地利用田边地角增种了大量小宗经济作物和瓜、豆、蔬菜等。仅据九个专区（市）不完全统计，增种的粮食和蔬菜面积就达八十九万亩。为了保证这些作物不仅种好而且管好，各地从田间管理一开始就加强了全面领导。特别是在有些地方发现群众中有忽视经济作物、旱地作物（杂粮）和小宗作物现象后，对这一问题更加注意。目前，全省各种作物生长都十分良好。中稻已中耕追肥一次，并有一半进行了第二次；玉米也有三分之一中耕两次，红苕边栽边施了追肥，棉田第二次追肥除草基本结束；在花生、芝麻、豆类等小宗作物方面，各地都按时进行了管理。
    各地经验证明，全面管好各种作物的关键，在于解决群众中各种不正确的认识，树立全面丰收的观点。有些人认为：“不种好粮食没吃的，别的收多少算多少”，“粮食是元帅，种好粮食就行了”，“宁种十亩田（水稻）、不种一亩土（杂粮）”，以及“劳动太紧忙不赢”等等，这些看法有的是属于认识问题，有的是缺乏办法。为此，许多地方都首先大张旗鼓地开展了宣传工作，向群众讲解全面丰收的意义。其次，针对不同思想情况进行查庄稼、查措施、查劳力、发动群众算各种账，思想问题和具体问题同时解决。这样做的效果很好。巴中县化成区有些公社原来不大重视小宗经济作物，立即发动群众算了三笔账：算经济作物支援国家建设账、改善人民经济生活账和增加公社收入账，同时在先进公社召开了现场会议，全区立即掀起了管好经济作物的高潮。
    合理安排劳力是全面管理的中心环节。各地一般的作法是：对大宗经济作物和杂粮采取划分战线，根据社员技术特长，建立专业队的做法。对一些小宗作物，则因地制宜、根据劳力多少、作物情况，采取多种多样灵活的方式。同时采用专业队与群众运动相结合的办法，解决突击性管理的需要。如纳溪县6月份以前没有建立专业队，全县棉花、花生、芝麻有30％生长不好，经过组织专业队管理后，不到十天就基本上达到了全苗、壮苗。铜梁县西泉公社对小宗作物采取三种办法加强管理：（1）技术性强、面积小的，固定专人管理；（2）一般技术要求不高的，根据大宗和小宗种植的先后次序，实行短安排和灵活调工；（3）突击三类苗时一齐动手。实行这一办法后，全社药材、小杂粮作物生长很好。对零星土地上增种的作物，达县一些公社采取就地进行配搭的办法，交给附近大田作物的专业队结合管理，大田中耕时就顺便把附近增种的作物中耕；不能结合管理的，则由种植的队、管理区统一安排时间和劳力管理。屏山县锦屏公社除安排了一定的劳力管理零星土地上增种的作物外，每个星期还专门划出半天时间，给社员们管理自种的零星作物。
    为了解决全面管理所需要的肥料，各地在使用肥料上都进行了合理分配，并大力发动群众积肥造肥，以便从根本上解决需肥激增的问题。一个多月来，各地利用夏季草木茂盛的时机，大抓积造青肥，同时千方百计增加土化肥产量，提高质量，广开肥源。绵阳、南充等许多专区6月份以来已开展了几次突击积肥运动，有些地区还开始实行积肥、造肥、用肥合一的办法，把积造肥的任务交给田间管理专业队，按作物、按田块、按生长期的需要，定数量、定质量、定时间一杆子插到底，这就更能充分满足各种作物不同的需要。　（于竞祁）
