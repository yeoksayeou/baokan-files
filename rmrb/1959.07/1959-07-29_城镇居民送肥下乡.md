Town Residents Send Fertilizer to the Countryside

The factories, government offices, schools, and residents of Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, have combined the summer sanitation campaign with the large-scale accumulation and production of fertilizer to support late rice production.

In the previous period, Jiaxing City achieved great success in accumulating and producing fertilizer to support agricultural production. The accumulated indigenous and miscellaneous fertilizers were enough to apply an average of 50 dan of fertilizer per mu to more than 37,000 mu of paddy fields in the city's suburbs. Since the beginning of summer, the city has combined the summer sanitation campaign to continue accumulating and producing fertilizer to support agricultural production. Now, the city is accumulating all scraps, waste residue, and sewage, ensuring that not a single bit is wasted. The rapeseed mud from the Jiaxing Oil Factory was originally discarded as waste, but now the factory workers have stored it all and sent it to the people's communes. The residents' committee of Jianshe Town in the city has established a regular sanitation system, adopting the methods of dividing sections for contracting, sweeping three times a day, and conducting a major cleaning every three days, which not only improves sanitation but also accumulates a large amount of fertilizer.

    城镇居民送肥下乡
    浙江省嘉兴市各工厂、机关、学校、居民结合夏季卫生运动，大量积、造肥料，支援晚稻生产。
    前一个时期嘉兴市积肥、造肥支援农业生产有很大成绩，所积土杂肥可使市郊三万七千多亩水田平均每亩施上肥料五十担。入夏以后，全市又结合夏季卫生运动，继续积肥造肥支援农业生产。现在，市里把所有下脚废料、残渣、污水都积贮起来，做到不浪费一点。嘉兴油厂菜籽泥本来当废物倒掉，现在厂里工人已把它全部贮藏起来，送给人民公社。该市建设镇居民委员会建立了经常性的卫生制度，采取分段包干、一天三扫、三天大搞的办法，既搞好了清洁卫生，又积了大量肥料。（附图片）
