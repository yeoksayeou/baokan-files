A commentator from this newspaper:

    The new technical management regulations (draft) being piloted by the Ministry of Railways starting July 1st, based on scientific analysis and mass debate, codify China’s railway management experience in recent years, especially the experience of the Great Leap Forward since 1958. Regulations that were unsuitable or not entirely suitable have also been revised, supplemented, or deleted. This will elevate the management level of China’s railway transportation and promote the continued Great Leap Forward of China’s railway transportation. The basic principles and working methods of the Ministry of Railways in rectifying and improving technical management regulations can also be used as a reference for various industrial, transportation, and transport departments.

    Many facts tell us that to do a good job in enterprise management, we must rely on strong political and ideological work, on “two participations” and “three combinations” to give full play to the revolutionary zeal of the broad masses, and on scientific management systems. For example, production quotas, quality inspection, economic accounting, safety production systems, and so on. At present, in enterprises with roughly the same raw materials, equipment, and worker skill levels, some enterprises have low product quality, high costs, or many accidents, while others have high product quality, low costs, and no accidents. This is related to whether or not various scientific and technical management systems exist and are strictly implemented.

    Some comrades regard the rules and regulations in enterprises as things that restrict the initiative and creativity of the workers. This view is incorrect. Correct systems reflect the interrelationships in production activities and embody the experience accumulated by people in production practice. Scientific systems are designed to guarantee production, prevent actions that violate scientific laws and hinder production, and combine the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses with the spirit of scientific analysis.

    Since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the broad masses of workers have created many important experiences in enterprise management. However, some of these experiences have not yet been systematically summarized and embodied in rules and regulations, becoming rules that all employees in the enterprise must strictly abide by, so that existing experiences can be carried forward. Therefore, rectifying and improving rules and regulations will not only not restrict the initiative and creativity of the masses, but is precisely the work that must be done to value the creation of the masses and consolidate and promote the enthusiasm of the masses.

    Rectifying and improving rules and regulations must never be done behind closed doors, but must be done using the mass line method in order to achieve practical results. The experience of the Ministry of Railways also proves this point.

    From the process of the Ministry of Railways formulating new technical management regulations, it can be seen that the three aspects of workers, scientific research institutions and technical personnel of functional organizations, and leading cadres have been combined from beginning to end, combining grasping typical examples, grasping key points, in-depth work with extensive appeals, and combining rectifying and improving rules and regulations with completing current transportation tasks. Since the end of August last year, the Ministry of Railways has focused on four different types of bureaus to begin rectifying and improving technical management regulations. These four bureaus include the Shenyang Railway Bureau, which has complete equipment, many double tracks, and large transportation volume, the Jinzhou Bureau, which has done a good job in the mass movement, the Taiyuan Bureau, which has poor equipment conditions and relatively tight transportation, and the Xi'an Bureau, which has new lines and new institutions. The Ministry of Railways instructed these four bureaus to base themselves on the actual situation of their bureaus, combine this with solving problems in completing current transportation tasks, and mobilize the masses to engage in great airing of views, great contending, and great debates to propose new draft technical management regulations on the basis of the old regulations. The Ministry of Railways also organized scientific researchers from the Railway Science Research Institute, professors and some students from the Railway Institute and the Railway Cadre School, and some full-time engineers from the Ministry to go to these bureaus to provide assistance, listen to the opinions of the masses, and conduct on-the-job inspections. At the same time, the Ministry of Railways also called on railway bureaus across the country to actively offer opinions on rectifying the regulations. Afterwards, the Ministry of Railways centralized the opinions of various bureaus, and then selected some veteran workers, foremen, technical personnel, and leading cadres to form a temporary office to repeatedly analyze, study, and synthesize them to create new draft technical management regulations. Now this draft has been approved by the Ministry of Railways for trial implementation. The Ministry of Railways also plans to make final revisions based on the test of practice and the opinions put forward by the masses during the trial implementation. The method of rectifying rules and regulations adopted by the Ministry of Railways is correct. The rules and regulations revised in this way have a broad mass base, scientific base, and practical base. Of course, the situation of industrial enterprises and railway enterprises is different, and the situation between various industrial enterprises is not exactly the same, so the steps and methods of rectifying rules and regulations in each enterprise should also be different. However, the method of using the mass line, through grasping typical examples, grasping key points, grasping scientific analysis, and through the method of experimentation, and closely combining with production, is applicable to any enterprise. Using this method to rectify and improve rules and regulations will better give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and better promote the continued Great Leap Forward of China's industry and transportation.

    用群众路线的方法整顿和健全规章制度
    本报评论员
    铁道部从7月1日起开始试行的新的技术管理规程（草案），把我国近几年来管理铁路的经验，特别是1958年以来大跃进的经验，经过科学的分析和群众辩论，用规程法定下来了；把原来的规程中不适合或不完全适合的，也进行了修改、补充或删除。这将使我国铁路运输事业的管理水平提高一步，促进我国铁路运输事业的继续大跃进。铁道部整顿和健全技术管理规程的基本原则和工作方法，也是可供各工业交通运输部门参考的。
    很多事实告诉我们，要作好企业的管理工作，必须靠强有力的政治思想工作，靠“两参”“三结合”发挥广大群众的革命干劲，靠科学的管理制度。例如生产定额、质量检验、经济核算、安全生产制度等等。目前，在原料、材料设备和工人技术水平大体相同的企业里，有的企业产品质量低、成本高，或事故多，有的企业产品质量高、成本低、无事故，这和有无和是否严格执行各种科学的技术管理制度有关。
    有的同志把企业里的规章制度一律看成是束缚工人群众积极性、创造性的东西，这种看法是不对的。正确的制度，反映着生产活动中的互相关系，它体现着人们在生产实践中积累的经验。科学的制度是为了保证生产，防止违反科学规律有碍生产的行动，把群众的干劲智慧和科学分析的精神结合起来。
    1958年大跃进以来，广大职工在企业管理方面都创造了不少重大的经验，但是，有些经验至今还没有经过系统的总结将其体现在规章制度之中，成为企业中全体职工必须严格遵守的规矩，使已有的经验发扬光大，因此，整顿和健全规章制度，不但不会束缚群众的积极性和创造性，而正是重视群众的创造、巩固和发扬群众积极性所必需作的工作。
    整顿和健全规章制度，绝不可闭门造车，而必须用群众路线的方法，才能奏实效，铁道部的经验也证明了这一点。
    从铁道部制定新技术管理规程的过程中，可以看出，工人群众、科学研究机关和职能机构的技术人员、领导干部这三方面自始至终地结合起来了，抓典型、抓重点，深入地工作和广泛地号召结合起来了，整顿和健全规章制度和完成当前的运输任务结合起来了。铁道部从去年8月底就以四个不同类型的局作为重点，开始整顿和健全技术管理规程。这四个局有设备全、复线多、运量大的沈阳铁路局，群众运动搞得好的锦州局，设备条件差，运输比较紧张的太原局和线路新机构新的西安局。铁道部指示这四个局根据本局的实际情况，结合解决完成当前运输工作任务中的问题，发动群众大鸣、大放、大辩论，在旧的规程的基础上，提出新的技术管理规程草案。铁道部并组织铁道科学研究院的科学研究人员、铁道学院和铁道干部学校的教授及部分学员，以及部里的一些专职工程师，分别到这些局进行帮助，听取群众意见，跟班考察。同时，铁道部还号召全国各铁路局也对整顿规程积极提出意见。之后，铁道部将各局的意见集中起来，再抽调一些老工人和工段长、技术人员、领导干部组成临时办公室，反复地进行分析、研究、综合，制成新的技术管理规程草案。现在这个草案经铁道部批准试行了。铁道部还准备根据实践的考验和群众在试行中提出的意见，再做最后的修改。铁道部这种整顿规章制度的方法是正确的。这样修订的规章制度，才具有广泛的群众基础、科学基础和实践基础。当然，工业企业和铁道企业的情况有所不同，各工业企业之间的情况也不完全相同，所以各企业整顿规章制度的步骤和作法也应该有所不同。但是，用群众路线的方法，通过抓典型、抓重点，抓科学分析和经过试验的方法，紧密结合生产的方法，却是适用于任何企业的。用这种方法来整顿和健全规章制度，将会更好地发挥群众的积极性和创造性，更好地促进我国工业和交通运输业的继续大跃进。
