Failure is the Mother of Success

This year, the yield of some of the wheat experimental fields in our province did not meet the expected requirements, and some even fell behind the general wheat fields. Regarding this matter, some comrades have been discussing it and blaming those whose experiments failed. The comrades who are discussing it may be motivated by good intentions, but their views are worth considering.

What should be said to these comrades?

First of all, it should be said that we must cherish the enthusiasm of the experimenters. Experimental work is of great significance for socialist construction and for the progress of all mankind. We know that in terms of mankind's ability to utilize nature, each generation surpasses the previous one, because people's understanding of objective laws is more advanced from one generation to the next. Those of us born in this generation can be said to be able to confidently utilize the laws of development of many things in nature. This is where we are more advanced and happier than our predecessors. But don't forget that the reason we can do many things with confidence is inseparable from the countless experiments of our predecessors. They provided us with a wealth of experience, allowing us to "reap the benefits" in many things. But it must be known that our predecessors, due to various limitations, especially the limitations of the exploitative system, had limited achievements in exploring the secrets of nature. The legacy they left us is far from enough compared to the vastness of nature and compared to our needs, not even one in ten thousand. Our socialist and communist construction is aimed at fully tapping the potential of nature so that human life becomes better every day. To achieve this goal, we must do many experiments that our predecessors have not done, and we must have thousands upon thousands of creative people engaged in various experimental works. Today, both cities and villages have seen the emergence of a large number of people enthusiastic about experimentation. These people can be called innovators or the most practical scientific workers. Although their experiments may not all be successful, their revolutionary enthusiasm is extremely valuable.

Secondly, it should be said that failure in the experimental process is unavoidable. What's the reason? This is related to the nature of the experiment. Experimentation is about exploring the laws of development of objective things, doing things that predecessors have not done, and solving problems that predecessors have not solved. There is no precedent to follow and no ready-made experience to learn from, just like the advance guard in a marching army, constantly groping forward. The process of experimentation is the process of understanding objective laws and also a process of practice. All experiments must go through repeated practice in order to draw correct conclusions. Because people's subjective understanding often lags behind objective existence, failures are inevitable in the experimental process. This is a truth that has been consistently proven by inventors throughout history, both in China and abroad. In the careers of inventors, there are hardly any who succeed at one stroke; all of them succeed only after several, dozens, or even hundreds of failures. For example, the inventor of "606" medicine suffered 605 failures, and it was not until the 606th experiment that he achieved great success. Since failure is an inevitable phenomenon in the experimental process, demanding that experimenters only succeed and not fail is a restriction on them. If this continues, what experiments will there be?

Thirdly, it should be said whether failure in experimentation is a bad thing or a good thing. Failure is a bad thing, but this bad thing can be turned into a good thing. The old saying "Failure is the mother of success" dialectically explains this truth. Saying that failure is a bad thing means that we have paid a price, but we don't get anything in return right now, so no experimenter wants to fail. Saying that a bad thing can be turned into a good thing means that it can force our experiments to be more precise until we arrive at the most reliable conclusion. If we look at the problem this way, we will feel that even if the experiment fails, it is not without meaning.

Finally, it should also be said to all comrades engaged in experimental work that as an experimenter, one should dare to break superstitions, boldly imagine, be courageous in creation, withstand any failures, and endure any blame. Without this spirit, there is no point in talking about experimentation. However, this does not mean that you can disregard objective laws and engage in unfounded fantasies, or do experiments that you know will fail regardless of the possibilities. Nor does it mean that because failure is inevitable, you can take a careless attitude towards experiments, prolonging the time and increasing the losses of experiments that could have been successful earlier and suffered fewer failures. Even more so, it does not mean that you can easily promote the experiment before a correct conclusion has been reached, resulting in great losses. The "motto" of all experimenters should be bold but careful, not reckless.

"Experimenters Should Be Allowed to Fail")

Dare to Ask, Ask More

To discover problems or solve problems, you must understand the situation. To understand the situation, you cannot do without asking. Asking means learning from the masses more.

Learning requires asking. "Asking" involves the question of daring or not daring. If a person is to go from ignorance to understanding, it is impossible without a little courage to "ask." Let's first talk about the older generation. Confucius could become a learned person, and it seems he had a trick: "Asking about everything."

There is a passage in the "Analects" that says: "When Confucius entered the Great Temple, he asked about everything." Others laughed at him, saying that he didn't understand anything and didn't "know etiquette." But Confucius had a different view. He believed that asking when you don't understand is precisely in accordance with "etiquette." A person who wants to be a teacher must first be a student; to do a good job as a leader, one must first be a student of the masses. This is because the masses really know more than any of us. Revolutionaries do any work for the benefit of the masses and cannot be separated from the masses. If we are determined to do our work well, we must take the masses as our teachers. Comrade Mao Zedong told us to have the spirit of willingly being a primary school student and to ask why about everything, which is also what this means.

To achieve "asking about everything" truly requires courage. Suppose there is a comrade who goes to a factory to "observe flowers," and goes all the way down to the workshop. Then, it is entirely possible to encounter many fresh problems like "Confucius entering the Great Temple," and may even not know quite a few basic knowledge of production. Have a heart-to-heart talk with a worker, and if you talk deeply, you will come into contact with many technical issues in production. What to do? Two ways: one is to listen to the general idea, not seek thorough understanding, and immediately make suggestions based on impressions; the other is to humbly seek advice, put down the airs, ask about everything, be a primary school student, and truly understand the main issues before making suggestions. Of course, the latter is more difficult. In order to pursue true knowledge and for the sake of revolutionary interests, you must summon up a little courage and throw away the stinky airs of "pretending to understand when you don't." If a revolutionary truly breathes the same air and shares the same fate with the masses; speaks the truth to the masses, "knows what he knows, and knows what he doesn't know," stands among the masses, and considers and studies matters closely related to the masses together with the masses, the masses will of course be happy to confide in him and talk about everything; conversely, standing above the masses, gesticulating, and pretending to understand when you don't, how can the masses talk sincerely with such people!

Comrade Mao Zedong has set a good example for us. We know that his famous work "Rural Surveys" was written with the help of many township-level cadres, peasants, scholars, jailers, merchants, and grain and tax clerks. Comrade Mao Zedong said that they "are my respectable and beloved teachers, and I must be respectful, diligent, and adopt a comradely attitude towards them when I am their student, otherwise they will ignore me, know but not say, or not say everything." It can be seen that whether or not one can discover the main problems when going down depends very much on one's attitude towards the masses. Are we as sincere as Comrade Mao Zedong in being primary school students of the masses? If this problem is solved, things will be easier.

The purpose of asking is to discover problems and then solve them. Then, it is necessary to discover problems on the one hand and start solving them on the other. If the problems raised by the masses are valued and solved in a timely manner, it will inevitably further promote the masses to help you more enthusiastically and talk to you more intimately. Conversely, if many problems are discovered among the masses, but the problems that can be solved and must be solved are not solved in a timely manner, I am afraid that being a little better or even better in attitude will not be conducive to the development of things.

### 失败是成功之母

    失败是成功之母
    今年我省的小麦试验田，有一部分的收获量没有达到预期的要求，个别的甚至落在一般麦田之后。对于这件事情，有些同志议论纷纭，责备试验失败了的人。议论的同志也许是出于良好的动机，但是他们的观点却是值得商榷的。
    对于这些同志，应当说些什么呢？
    首先应当说的是必须珍爱试验者的热情。试验工作，对于社会主义建设，对于整个人类的进步，都有重大意义。我们知道，从人类利用大自然的本领来说，是一代超过一代，因为人们对于客观规律的认识，是一代比一代进步。生在我们这一代的人，对于自然界许多事物的发展规律，可以说是能够有把握的利用了，这是我们比前人更高明、更幸福的地方。但是不要忘记，我们所以能够有把握地做好许多事情，是与前人无数的试验分不开的，他们给我们提供了大量的经验，使我们在许多事情上吃了“现成饭”。但是必须知道，我们的前人，因为受了种种条件的限制，特别是剥削制度的限制，他们在探索大自然秘密方面的成就也就有限。他们给我们留下的遗产，与大自然的蕴藏比较起来，与我们的要求比较起来，还差得很远，简直不及其万一。我们进行社会主义和共产主义建设，就是要充分地挖掘大自然的潜力，使人类生活一天比一天美好。为了达到这个目的，我们必须做前人没有做过的许多试验，必须有成千上万的勇于创造的人来从事种种试验工作。今天，不论城市和农村，都出现了大批热心试验的人，这些都可称为革新家，也可称为最实际的科学工作者。尽管他们的试验不一定都能够成功，但是他们这种革命的热情却是极其可贵的。
    其次，应当说的是试验过程中的失败是难以避免的。什么道理呢？这是与试验的性质有关。试验是探求客观事物发展规律的，是做前人没有做过的事情，解决前人没有解决了的问题，没有先例可援，没有现成的经验可以借鉴，就像行军中的尖兵一样，时刻在摸索中前进。试验的过程，就是对于客观规律认识的过程，也是一个实践的过程。一切的试验，都必须经过反复的实践，才能得出正确的结论。由于人的主观认识常常落后于客观存在，所以在试验过程中就难免要有失败，这是古今中外的发明家一致证明了的真理。在发明家的事业中，一举而成功的可以说是没有的，都是经过数次、数十次、数百次的失败才成功了的。比如“六○六”药的发明者，他遭受了六○五次失败，直到六○六次试验，才算大功告成。失败既然是试验过程中不可避免的现象，那末，要求试验者只能成功，不能失败，就是对他们的一种限制。试问，这样下去，还会有什么试验呢？
    再次，应当说的是试验中的失败是坏事还是好事。失败是一件坏事，但是，这件坏事是可以变成好事的，“失败是成功之母”这句古话，就辩证地说明了这个真理。说失败是坏事，是我们付出了代价，而眼下却得不到什么东西，所以没有一个试验者是愿意失败的。说坏事可以变成好事，是它可以迫使我们的试验精益求精，直到得出最可靠的结论。如果这样来看问题，就会觉得即使试验失败了，也不是毫无意义的。
    最后，还应当向一切从事试验工作的同志说，作为一个试验者，应当是敢于破除迷信，大胆设想，勇于创造，经得起任何的失败，受得住任何的责备，没有这种精神，就谈不上什么试验。但是，这并不是说，你就可以不尊重客观规律，毫无根据地去胡思乱想，不顾可能地去搞那些明知要失败的试验；也不是说，因为失败的不可避免，你就可以对试验采取漫不经心的态度，使那些本可以早点成功、少遭失败的试验，延长了时间、多遭了损失；更不是说，试验还没有得出正确的结论，就轻易地推广，以致造成很大的损失。一切试验者的“座右铭”应当是胆大心细，而不是胡思乱干。

    敢问多问
    要发现问题或解决问题，都要了解情况。要了解情况就离不开问。问，就是要多向群众请教。
    学问学问，离不开“问”。“问”，有个敢与不敢的问题。一个人要从不懂到懂，没有一点“问”的勇气是不行的。先说古一辈人。孔子能成为有学问的人，看来有一个诀窍：“每事问”。
  “论语”上有这样一段：“子入太庙，每事问。”别人笑他，说他样样不懂，不“知礼”。而孔子的看法不同。他认为不懂就问，恰恰是合乎
  “礼”。一个人要做老师，就先要做学生；要做好领导工作，首先就要做群众的学生。那是因为群众的确比我们任何一个人懂得多。革命者做任何工作都是为了群众利益，也离不开群众。如果我们立志要把工作做好，就非得拜群众为师不可。毛泽东同志告诉我们要有甘当小学生的精神，对任何事情都要问一个为什么，也是这个意思。
    要做到“每事问”，确实需要一股勇气。假定有这样一位同志，下厂去“观花”，而且一直下到了车间，那么，完全可能碰到“子入太庙”那样的许多新鲜问题，甚至还有不少生产上的起码知识也不知道。找个工人谈谈心吧，谈得深一些，就会接触到许多生产技术上的问题。怎么办？两个办法，一个是听其大概，不求甚解，马上凭印象出主张；一个是虚心求教，放下架子，每事问，做小学生，把主要问题真正弄懂了，再出主意。当然，后者较不容易。为了追求真知，为了革命利益，就得拿出一点勇气来，扔掉“不懂装懂”的臭架子。如果一个革命者真正做到与群众共呼吸，心连心；同群众说真话，“知之为知之，不知为不知”，自己站在群众中间，同群众一道来考虑、研究与群众切身有关的事情，群众当然乐于推心置腹，无话不谈；反过来，站在群众之上，指手划脚，不懂装懂，群众又怎么会同这样的人谈真心话呢！
    毛泽东同志为我们树立了一个好榜样。我们知道，他那有名的著作“农村调查”的写成，就曾得到许多乡级干部、农民、秀才、狱吏、商人和钱粮师爷的帮助。毛泽东同志说，他们“就是我的可敬爱的先生，我给他们当学生是必须恭谨勤劳和采取同志态度的，否则他们就不理我，知而不言，言而不尽。”可见，下去能不能发现主要问题，对群众的态度很关紧要。我们是否如毛泽东同志那样真心诚意去做群众的小学生呢？这个问题解决了，事情就容易办了。
    问的目的，是为了发现问题以后去解决问题，那就需要一面发现问题，一面着手解决问题。群众提出的问题，受到重视和及时解决，那就势必进一步促使群众更加热情地帮助你，更向你谈知心话。反之，如果在群众中发现了有不少问题，对可以解决、必须解决的问题却没及时解决，恐怕态度好些，再好些，也不会有利于事物的发展的。
