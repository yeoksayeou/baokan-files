    Important Steps in Morocco's Development of a National Economy
    Wang Wei, Lu Mingzhu

    On July 2nd, the "Bank of Morocco," wholly owned by Morocco itself, was born. The so-called "State Bank of Morocco," which had been controlled by colonialists for more than fifty years, was declared to cease all activities, and its privilege of issuing currency in Morocco was also abolished. This is a major measure for Morocco to strive to develop an independent national economy.

    As early as 1906, twelve colonialist countries, including France, Britain, the United States, and Germany, forced Morocco to sign the "Algeciras Treaty," establishing the so-called "State Bank," which enjoyed a forty-year privilege. Soon Morocco became a French "protectorate." In 1946, the privilege of the "State Bank of Morocco" was announced to be extended for another twenty years.

    The so-called "State Bank of Morocco" was in the hands of French capitalists. It was actually a branch of the Bank of France. Other shareholders were capitalists from Spain, Portugal, and Italy. Through this bank, French colonialists controlled the economic lifeline of Morocco, becoming an important pillar of French rule over Morocco. It was like an invisible suction tube sucking the blood and sweat of the Moroccan people for half a century. The capital of this bank was only 15.4 million francs when it was established, but it reached 46.2 million francs in 1955; its net profit in 1948 was 57.8 million francs, which increased to 158.7 million francs in 1953. However, the average monthly salary of each worker in Morocco was less than 10,000 francs, and the average annual income of a farmer was only 30,000 francs. As pointed out in the resolution of the Central Committee of the Moroccan Communist Party in September 1956: "The State Bank of Morocco has become a state within a state, serving the interests of the colonialists. This bank arose with the colonization of Morocco."

    Since Morocco gained independence, at the request of the broad masses of the people, the Moroccan government and the French government have held many talks on the issue of ceasing the activities of the "State Bank of Morocco." Despite the colonialists' best efforts to obstruct it, the Moroccan government, with the strong support of the people and Moroccan public opinion, finally decided to establish the "Bank of Morocco" in July of this year. At this time, a strange "strike" occurred in Rabat. The French staff of this "State Bank of Morocco" declared a strike, engaging in sabotage. However, when the French staff left their offices, the Moroccan staff immediately replaced them, and the work continued smoothly, crushing the conspiracy of the strike. A commentary in Morocco's "Liberation Daily" said: "Some people believe that foreign experts and technicians are absolutely necessary for us. But now we can do without them. This strike has proven that we can manage our own country. We have confidence in the future."

    Although Morocco has achieved political independence, the national economy is still almost entirely controlled by French capitalists. As announced by Moroccan Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Economy and Finance, Bouabid: the main goal of the Moroccan government after independence is to free Morocco's economy from its dependence on France. Although the Moroccan government encounters many difficulties in implementing this policy, it continues to move towards this goal.

    When the French government announced the devaluation of the franc at the end of last year, the Moroccan government, under the strong demands of the people, in order to protect its own economic interests, while still remaining in the franc zone, adopted measures in line with national interests, deciding to sever ties with the French franc and maintain the value of the Moroccan franc. At the same time, in order to accelerate its own economic development and get rid of its dependence on France, the Moroccan government signed trade agreements with China, the Soviet Union, and other countries. This was the first time in Moroccan history.

    The Moroccan government has formulated a tariff policy to protect the national economy, restricting the import of luxury goods and goods that can be produced domestically, and increasing the special tax on the flow of funds from Morocco to other countries in the franc zone in order to deal with foreign dumping. Not long ago, the "National Tea Monopoly Bureau" was also established, and it began to strengthen the control of tea imports and exports and production, which has an important impact on the people's livelihood. These measures will undoubtedly have a positive effect. Morocco's foreign trade deficit has been declining year by year. In 1958, imports reached 165 billion francs, equivalent to 50% of the gross national product, and half of the imports came from the franc zone; however, exports increased by 21% compared with 1957. The trade deficit in 1955 was 63 billion francs, which decreased to 38 billion francs in 1956, only 27 billion francs in 1957, and further decreased to 22 billion francs in 1958. According to official Moroccan data, Morocco's current trade deficit accounts for only 6% of the total trade volume.

    Looking at Morocco's national budget, it is far from being balanced, but it has changed the nature of the budget and is gradually getting rid of its dependence on France. In the past, almost all budget deficits were made up by French financial "aid," but due to France's own economic crisis and the Moroccan government's sympathetic attitude towards Algeria's struggle for independence, French financial "aid" to Morocco has been decreasing year by year. The Moroccan government continues to reduce the budget deficit from all aspects. This year, the funds that Morocco's budget can provide domestically have increased from 39% last year to 52% this year.

    Although the efforts made by the Moroccan government to get rid of its dependence on the colonial economy have achieved such achievements, there is still a difficult journey ahead on the road to developing its own national economy independently. It is particularly important not to ignore that the colonialists will create many difficulties to hinder the independence and development of Morocco's national economy. The recently launched "Masses" weekly pointed out that the Moroccanization of the state bank only prepares Morocco for the conditions to effectively control its currency and opens up prospects for implementing new national policies. At present, although the "Paris Netherlands Bank" has lost its privilege of issuing currency in Morocco, it still controls some key sectors of the Moroccan national economy, such as minerals, transportation, and electricity. Therefore, if other measures are not taken accordingly in the economic field, then the blow to the "Paris Netherlands Bank" cannot achieve truly effective results. "If we want to establish a true, independent economy required by the entire national movement, then we should now touch the many other privileges seized by foreign financial monopoly capital. The nationalization of these sectors of the national economy should be implemented now." The Moroccan people earnestly hope that the government can fulfill their national aspirations.

    摩洛哥发展民族经济的重要步骤
    王纬　陆明珠
    7月2日，属于摩洛哥自己所有的“摩洛哥银行”诞生了。被殖民主义者控制了五十多年的所谓“摩洛哥国家银行”，被宣告停止一切活动，它在摩洛哥发行货币的特权也被取消了。这是摩洛哥争取发展独立的民族经济的一项重大措施。
    远在1906年，法、英、美、德等十二个殖民主义国家，强迫摩洛哥签订“阿尔几西拉斯条约”，成立了所谓“国家银行”，它享有为期四十年特权。不久摩洛哥就变成了法国的“保护国”。1946年，“摩洛哥国家银行”的特权又宣布延长二十年。
    所谓“摩洛哥国家银行”是掌握在法国资本家手里的。它实际上是法兰西银行的一个分行。其它的股票所有人是西班牙、葡萄牙、意大利的资本家们。通过这个银行，法国殖民主义者控制了摩洛哥国家的经济命脉，成为法国统治摩洛哥的重要支柱。它像一根看不见的吸血管吮吸了半世纪的摩洛哥人民的血汗。这个银行的资本在成立的时候只有一千五百四十万法郎，1955年已经达到四千六百二十万法郎；1948年它得到的纯利是五千七百八十万法郎，到1953年已经增加到一亿五千八百七十万法郎。而摩洛哥每个工人的月薪平均不到一万法郎，一个农民平均每年的收入只有三万法郎。正如摩共中央1956年9月的决议所指出的：“摩洛哥国家银行已成为国中之国，它是为殖民主义者的利益服务的。这个银行是随着摩洛哥的殖民地化而产生的”。
    摩洛哥取得独立以来，在广大人民群众的要求下，摩洛哥政府和法国政府就停止“摩洛哥国家银行”活动问题进行了多次会谈。尽管殖民主义者竭尽阻挠之能事，但是摩洛哥政府在人民和摩洛哥舆论的有力支持下，终于决定在今年7月成立“摩洛哥银行”。在这时候，拉巴特出现了一次奇怪的“罢工”。这个“摩洛哥国家银行”的法籍职员宣告罢工，进行捣乱。可是，当法籍职员离开他们的办公室的时候，摩洛哥的工作人员马上代替了他们，工作照常顺利地进行，粉碎了罢工的阴谋。摩洛哥“解放报”的评论说：“有些人认为，外国专家和技术人员是我们绝对需要的。但是现在我们没有他们也行。通过这次罢工证明了我们自己能够管理我们的国家。我们对未来抱有信心”。
    摩洛哥虽然在政治上取得了独立，但国家经济几乎还完全控制在法国资本家手里。正如摩洛哥副首相兼国民经济和财政大臣布阿比德所宣布的：摩洛哥政府独立以后的主要目标，是使摩洛哥的经济摆脱对法国的依赖。虽然摩洛哥政府在执行这个政策的时候碰到许多困难，但仍然不断地向着这个目标前进着。
    去年底法国政府宣布法郎贬值的时候，摩洛哥政府在人民群众的强烈要求下，为了保护本国的经济利益，在仍然留在法郎区的原则下，采取了符合国家利益的措施，决定割断与法国法郎的联系，维持摩洛哥法郎的价值。同时，摩洛哥政府为了加速自己的经济发展，摆脱对法国的依赖，和中国、苏联以及其它国家签定了贸易协定。这在摩洛哥历史上还是第一次。
    摩洛哥政府制定了保护民族经济的关税政策，限制奢侈品和本国能够生产的商品的进口，增收从摩洛哥到法郎区其它国家的资金流转特别税，以对付外国的倾销。不久以前还成立了“全国茶叶专卖局”，开始加强对国民生计有重要影响的茶叶的进出口和生产的管制。这些措施，无疑都会收到积极的效果。摩洛哥对外贸易的逆差已逐年下降。1958年进口达一千六百五十亿法郎，等于国民生产总值的50％，进口半数来自法郎区；但出口比1957年增加了21％。1955年的贸易赤字为六百三十亿法郎，1956年下降到三百八十亿法郎，1957年只有二百七十亿法郎，1958年再下降到二百二十亿法郎。根据摩洛哥官方公布的材料，摩洛哥目前的贸易赤字只占贸易总额的6％。
    从摩洛哥的国家预算来看，还远没有达到平衡，但是，它已经改变了预算的性质，逐步摆脱对法国的依赖。过去差不多全部预算的赤字靠法国的财政“援助”来弥补，但是由于法国自身的经济危机以及摩洛哥政府对阿尔及利亚争取独立所持的同情态度，法国对摩洛哥的财政“援助”逐年减少。摩洛哥政府不断从各方面减少预算赤字，今年摩洛哥的预算本国能提供的资金已由去年的39％增加到今年的52％。
    虽然摩洛哥政府在摆脱对殖民主义经济依赖所作的努力获得了这样的成就，但是离开独立地发展自己的民族经济的道路还有一段艰苦的途程。特别不容忽视的是，殖民主义者还会制造许多困难来阻碍摩洛哥民族经济的独立与发展。最近创刊的“群众”周报指出：国家银行的摩洛哥化，只是为摩洛哥准备了有效地控制它的货币的条件，为实行民族的新的政策开辟了前景。目前“巴黎荷兰银行”虽然失去了它在摩洛哥发行货币的特权，但是它还控制着摩洛哥国民经济一些关键部门，如矿产、交通运输、电力等。因此，如果在经济方面不随之而采取其它的措施，那么对“巴黎荷兰银行”的打击就不可能达到真正有效的成果。“如果我们要建立一个整个民族运动所要求的真正的、独立的经济的话，那么现在就应当触动那些被外国财政垄断资本所夺取的许许多多的其它特权。国家经济的这些部门的国有化现在应该实行了”。摩洛哥人民热切地希望政府能够满足他们的这个民族愿望。
