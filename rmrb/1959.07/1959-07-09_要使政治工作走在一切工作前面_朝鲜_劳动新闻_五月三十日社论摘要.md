To Put Political Work Ahead of All Other Work
--Abstract of the "Labor News" Editorial of North Korea on May 30

    Today, our national economy continues to develop rapidly, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses is very high.

    In this revolutionary upsurge, we must unleash the revolutionary zeal and wisdom of the masses without reservation, constantly innovate, and constantly move forward. We must not only victoriously complete this year's plan, but also lay a solid foundation for calmly solving the long-term tasks of the upcoming Second Five-Year Plan.

    Our successful completion of the grand economic and cultural tasks depends entirely on how we conduct political and ideological mobilization of the masses and how we unleash their infinite power.

    Today's reality urgently requires us to improve our leadership of the masses. Placing political work ahead in leading economic and cultural construction is the key to determining all achievements.

    The secret of our Party leading the masses to leap forward on the Chollima is none other than relying on the masses and enabling them to correctly understand the significance and purpose of revolutionary tasks, and to give play to their consciousness and initiative.

    Therefore, the Central Committee of the Party has repeatedly reminded all leading personnel to strengthen political work.

    At the recent meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Party, Comrade Kim Il-sung once again emphasized that in the current stage of building socialism, in order to continue to maintain the revolutionary upsurge and continuously expand the achievements of economic and cultural construction, it is necessary to place political work ahead of all other work.

    If political work is not put first, no results can be expected. Therefore, political work should not only be done by Party cadres, but is also the primary task of all administrative, economic, and cultural leading cadres.

    Our Party cadres, no matter what department they work in—politics, economics, education, culture, or science—must be concerned about the Party's work and political work, must actively participate in the political leadership of subordinates, and must work and live under the leadership and control of the Party Committee. If leading personnel separate politics from economics and neglect political leadership, they will inevitably degenerate into vulgar pragmatists, and where such personnel work, no work achievements can be expected.

    Experience has proven that wherever the political leadership of the subordinate departments is good, the economic work there will also proceed well.

    In order to victoriously implement the huge annual plan including the production of 200 million meters of textiles, the leading personnel of the Ministry of Light Industry, disregarding various difficulties, constantly carried out the Party's organizational work and political work among Party members and the working people, enabling them to develop their creativity and initiative. They produced a large number of machine tools themselves, thereby ensuring the production of spinning machines, winding machines, cotton adjusting machines, weaving machines, and various parts needed for these machines.

    Life requires every leading cadre not to be detached from politics, but to frequently go deep among the masses, explain the Party's policies to them, further mobilize the political enthusiasm of the masses, and enable them to complete their tasks with confidence. It is necessary to hold fewer complicated meetings, create fewer worthless documents, and frequently go deep into the lower levels and do more work with people—political work.

    When responsible cadres of provinces (bureaus) go to factories and mines, they should not only look for leaders or chief engineers to discuss plan figures, but should also give more political reports, speeches, and talks, participate in Party meetings and "production agreement conferences," listen to the creative suggestions of our workers and technicians, and help solve the difficulties they encounter.

    It is also necessary to resolutely eliminate the sightseeing-style leadership methods that have long been abandoned in life.

    At the same time, it is necessary for leading cadres of state, economic, and cultural organs, factories, and enterprises to always rely closely on the Party organization for work and actively participate in the work of their own Party organization.

    Participating in Party work does not mean simply participating in form. More importantly, at Party meetings, not only should leading personnel actively put forward their own opinions, but they should also listen to the voices of Party members and the masses, take the initiative to accept the Party's division of labor, and do their best to carry it out.

    All work achievements are unimaginable without the active leadership and assistance of the Party committee.

    Leaders of provinces (bureaus) and all local government organs are responsible to the Party not only for administrative work, but also for the Party's work in their respective departments.

    Experience has proven that cadres who are detached from the Party's leadership will become people with dull political sense and loose thinking. Party organizations must strengthen the Party organizational life of responsible persons and wage a resolute struggle against the tendency of some people to dislike the Party's leadership. Strengthening Party organizational life is a basic condition for strengthening the political and ideological training of leading cadres and raising their political leadership level.

    Leading cadres are the organizers and propagandists of implementing the Party's policies. Therefore, cadres must deeply understand the Party's policies and the intentions of the Central Committee of the Party, thoroughly implement them among the masses, and be able to adapt them to the actual conditions of their own departments. This requires arming the leaders of economic departments with the Party's policies and resolutely requiring them to improve their theoretical level. Without understanding, it is impossible to exert creativity and take the lead in leadership work, and it is impossible to thoroughly implement the Party's policies.

    Comrade Kim Il-sung said at the expanded plenary session of the North Hamgyong Provincial Party Committee: "You must study three to four hours every day. Without studying, it is impossible to manage the economy, and it is impossible to promote social development. We cannot stagnate. We must continue to move forward according to the laws of development. This requires comrades to understand."

    Every leader must study Marxist-Leninist theory and deeply study the Party's policies, resolutions, and instructions creatively applied to the situation in Korea in order to continuously improve their political and theoretical level.

    Today, our rapidly developing reality requires leaders to resolutely improve their leadership work to adapt to the new environment. Responsible persons of various provinces (bureaus) and local people's committees, and leaders of factories and enterprises must place political work ahead of all leadership work.

    Putting political work ahead of all other work is the guarantee for further developing our revolutionary upsurge and achieving greater achievements in socialist construction.

    要使政治工作走在一切工作前面
    ——朝鲜“劳动新闻”五月三十日社论摘要
    今天，我国人民经济继续飞速发展，群众的革命情绪非常高涨。
    我们在这革命高潮中，要使群众的革命热情和智慧无遗地发挥出来，不断革新和不断前进。不但要胜利完成今年度的计划，并且为从容地解决今后第二个五年计划的远景任务而打下巩固的基础。
  我们要胜利完成雄伟的经济和文化任务，这完全取决于我们怎样进行对群众的政治和思想动员，怎样使他们发挥无穷无尽的力量。
    今天的现实情况迫切要求我们改进对群众的领导工作。要在对经济、文化建设的领导上，使政治工作走在前面，这是决定一切成就的关键。
    我们党领导群众跨上千里马飞跃前进的秘诀不外是依靠群众，并且使群众正确认识革命任务的意义和目的，发挥他们的自觉性和积极性。
    因此，党中央委员会多次提醒所有领导人员要加强政治工作。
    在最近举行的党中央委员会常务委员会会议上，金日成同志再一次强调：在目前建设社会主义阶段，为了继续保持革命高潮和不断扩大经济、文化建设的成果，必须使政治工作走在一切工作的前面。
    要是不把政治工作放在前面，就不能期待任何成果。因此，政治工作不仅要由党的干部去做，而且是所有行政、经济、文化领导干部也要去做的头等任务。
    我们党的干部，不管他在政治、经济、教育、文化和科学等任何部门工作，不能不关心党的工作和政治工作，必须积极参加对下级的政治领导，必须在党委员会的领导和控制下工作和生活。如果领导人员把政治和经济分割开来，并忽视政治领导，他们就必然堕落成为庸俗的事务主义者，在有这样工作人员工作的地方，是不可能期待任何工作成就的。
    经验证明：哪里对所属部门在政治上领导得好，那里经济工作也就进行得好。
    轻工业省领导人员为胜利地执行包括两亿公尺纺织品生产在内的庞大的今年度计划中，不顾种种困难，在党员和劳动人民中不断地进行党的组织工作和对群众的政治工作，使他们发挥了创造性和积极性，自己生产大量工作母机，从而很好地保证生产纺纱机、卷丝机、调棉机、织布机等和这些机器所需要的各种零件。
    生活要求我们每个领导干部不要脱离政治，而要经常地深入群众，向他们解释党的政策，进一步发动群众的政治热情，使他们有信心地完成自己的任务。少开些繁杂的会议，少搞些无价值的文件，而经常深入下层，多作人的工作——政治工作是必要的。
    省（局）的负责干部下到厂矿去不要单找领导人或总工程师扣计划数字，而要多作政治报告、讲演、谈话，参加党的会议和“生产协议会”，倾听我们的工人、技术人员的创造性的建议，并帮助解决所遇到的困难。
    还要坚决消灭早已在生活中被唾弃的游览式的领导方法。
    同时，国家、经济、文化机关，工厂、企业的领导干部，要会经常地紧紧依靠党组织作工作，并积极地参加自己所属的党组织的工作是必要的。
    参加党的工作并不是说形式上参加就行了。更重要的是要在党的会议上，不仅积极地提出领导人员自己的意见，而且还要倾听党员群众的呼声，主动地接受党的分工，并为其执行而尽自己的全力。
    一切工作成就，离开党委的积极领导和帮助是难以设想的。
    省（局）和所有地方政权机关的领导人，不仅对行政工作，而且对自己所属部门的党的工作也要对党负责。
    经验证明：干部如果脱离党的领导，将成为政治嗅觉不灵、思想松懈的人。党组织要加强负责人的党的组织生活，同部分人员讨厌党的领导的倾向做坚决的斗争。加强党的组织生活——这是加强领导干部政治思想锻炼，提高他们政治领导水平的基本条件。
    领导干部是贯彻党的政策的组织者和宣传者。所以，干部们要深刻体会党的政策和党中央委员会的意图，彻底贯彻到群众中去，并且要会使它适应自己部门的实际情况。这就要求以党的政策武装经济部门的领导人，并坚决地要求他们提高理论水平。不懂就不可能在领导工作中发挥创造性和起带头作用，也不可能彻底贯彻党的政策。
    金日成同志在咸镜北道党委员会全体扩大会议上说过：“每天一定要学习三小时到四小时。不学习就不可能管理经济，也不可能促进社会的发展。我们不能停滞不前。我们要根据发展规律继续前进。这样就要求同志们要懂。”
    每个领导人要学习马克思列宁主义理论并深刻研究创造性地运用于朝鲜情况的党的政策、决议和指示，以不断提高自己的政治理论水平。
    今天飞跃发展的我们的现实，要求领导人坚决地改进领导工作，以适应新的环境。各省（局）的负责人和地方人民委员会，工厂、企业的领导人要使政治工作走在一切领导工作的前面。
    要使政治工作走在一切工作的前面——这是进一步发展我们的革命高潮，在社会主义建设中取得更大成就的保证。
