    Cybernetics and the Brain

    The Brain – The Highest Form of Material Organization

    The brain is the organ of all human knowledge and wisdom. People understand the objective world and create science through the activities of the brain. But what level of scientific understanding do we have of the brain in the 1960s? As the Russian materialist philosopher Belinsky once asked: "The function of wisdom, that is, the activity of wisdom, is the result of the activity of the brain organ. But who has peeked at the movement of this organ when we are wise? Will it one day be clear about this activity?"

    The scientific understanding of the animal and human brain can be said to have begun in 1870 (Pavlov's words). Since Cambell and Brodmann first used histological methods, Fléchsig and Danilovsky et al. first used cortical stimulation or resection methods, Cajal and Berger first used electroencephalography in animals and humans, and Pavlov first used the conditioned reflex method to study the brain, nearly a hundred years have passed. From one aspect, one perspective, or one discipline, certain achievements have been made, and thousands or tens of thousands of research documents have been accumulated. However, overall, comprehensively, our understanding of the highest form of material organization—the brain—this magnificent and complex mechanism, is still far from sufficient, still only the first two laps of a ten-thousand-meter race.

    We now know that the brain is composed of approximately tens of billions of nerve cells. The cerebral cortex is divided into six layers, with the most important pyramidal cells residing in the fifth layer. The cerebral cortex has a localization function, such as the 17, 18, and 19 areas of the occipital lobe for vision (Brodmann areas). The cerebral cortex has six or seven kinds of alternating current waves, such as α (8 to 13 cycles per second), β (14 to 30 cycles per second), δ (0.5 to 3 cycles per second), and θ (4 to 7 cycles per second). α waves appear more often in the posterior part of the cerebral cortex, β waves appear more often in the anterior part of the cerebral cortex, δ waves are most likely to appear when people are sound asleep, and θ waves are most significant in children aged two to five. The brain can establish temporary connections and has the laws of excitation and inhibition, differentiation and synthesis, diffusion and concentration. But we still don't know what "characteristic curves" the computing elements (nerve cells) of the brain have. Neurophysiologists are still debating the origin of brain alternating current waves. At the same time, no one in the world can currently tell you which nerve cells are specifically connected in the brain for temporary connections.

    Cybernetics studies the general principles and similarities of control and communication processes in different fields.

    Cybernetics is a young science. It has only been eleven years since Norbert Wiener wrote the first book "Cybernetics—or Control and Communication Theory in Animals and Machines" in 1948. However, the achievements of automation technology and electronic computing technology are so amazing that their impact on human life has been called "a second industrial revolution." Since cybernetics studies the general principles and similarities of control and communication processes in very different fields, it is only natural that people are very interested in the research on the similarities or analogies between electronic computers and the brain. More and more neurophysiology and psychology workers are now affirming the importance and possibility of using quantitative theory to study the brain, and more and more mathematicians are affirming the important significance of brain control and information transmission research to cybernetics. From a cybernetics perspective, the brain is indeed an aspect of control system research, and perhaps the most perfect, most complex, and most difficult to study of all control systems in nature.

    Roughly speaking, our human body is composed of 639 muscles, 206 bones, 105 bone levers or pulleys, more than four million peripheral nerve fibers, and approximately 14 billion nerve cells in the nerve center. Human sensory processes (such as sight, hearing, smell, cold, heat, etc.) and behavior control processes (such as standing upright, walking, writing, language, etc.) are all controlled by a series of afferent or efferent nerve impulses. Without exception, all stimuli from the objective world must be transformed into nerve impulses before people can perceive them, and these impulses are similar to the electronic impulses in digital electronic computers, basically obeying the same "all or nothing" (i.e., binary system, 0 and 1) and "pulse frequency modulation" laws. Among the aforementioned more than four million peripheral nerve fibers, the two eyes account for approximately one million each, and the two ears account for approximately thirty thousand each. If each nerve fiber can transmit an average of three hundred pulses per second, then the two eyes can transmit up to approximately six hundred million binary digits, and the two ears can transmit up to approximately eighteen million binary digits. Of course, such calculations may not be completely accurate, but it shows that the maximum amount of information that human vision can transmit accounts for about half of the brain's control system, which is thirty times greater than the maximum amount of information possible for hearing. This shows that the special position of vision in human reflection of objective things can find objective basis in histology and mathematics. The fourteen billion nerve cells in the nerve center are diverse and closely related. Some studies have shown that the nerve cells of the brain can have information transmission relationships with a thousand neighbors (Clegg and Temple), the outside of these nerve cells carries a positive charge of 0.07 volts relative to the inside, and each square centimeter of nerve cell contains approximately 1 microfarad of capacitance (McCulloch). Because of the physical and chemical properties of nerve cells and the certain delay (approximately 1 millisecond) required for nerve impulses to pass through each synapse, the transmission speed of nerve impulses is much slower than the impulses in electronic computers. Electronic experts are now designing fast digital electronic computers that can perform 500,000 operations of 12×15 digits per second, but the conduction frequency of nerve impulses generally does not exceed 400 to 500 times per second at most. Except for the cerebellum, the alternating current waves of the nerve center rarely reach more than 100 cycles per second, while the frequency of the most important α waves in the cerebral cortex is only 8 to 13 cycles per second. Studying the cerebral cortex of animals, it is learned that the conduction of several excitations generally does not exceed 15 to 20 millimeters per second, and the so-called "diffusion inhibition wave" is even slower, conducting only 3 millimeters per minute. Psychologists studying the speed of information transmission in human actual life have found that it does not exceed 25 binary digits per second at most. However, it is not necessarily correct to blindly pursue the number of binary digits in human information transmission, because human recognition and memory processes follow certain laws or patterns. Each of us has these laws or patterns, but each of us may not be fully aware of their existence. When we calculate 8×99, we certainly will not be as clumsy as a digital computer and first convert it into a binary system, nor do we need to directly multiply 8 by 99 less clumsily, because many people only need to use 100×8 and then subtract 8 to get the answer. It should be pointed out that discovering and creating the best laws or patterns in human actual life information transmission will greatly improve human efficiency in practice. If we use the nerve center to represent the controller, the muscles to represent the arithmetic unit, and the motor nerve fibers to represent the transmission of instructions, then the other meaning of the sensory nerve fibers represents the afferent of feedback. Because the human body has about five times more sensory nerve fibers than motor nerve fibers, the amount of feedback information is relatively abundant, and even if part of the sensory fibers are damaged, the center can often perform effective control. However, human feedback is not only a physical effect of nerves, but also has about two hundred million microvessels, with a total length of about one hundred thousand kilometers; at the same time, there are six major endocrine glands, so feedback often involves the effects of blood and endocrine. The feedback principle of the brain control system can be experimented with in several ways. We know that the alternating current in the cerebral cortex has a "rhythm assimilation" phenomenon, that is, if a person is given flashing light stimulation of 4 to 60 cycles per second, then alternating current waves of 4 to 60 cycles per second that match the stimulation frequency may appear in his cerebral cortex, and it may also make him feel color illusions that adapt to the stimulation frequency. If an automatic device is used to place the recording electrode in the occipital lobe area of his cerebral cortex, and his brain electrical pulses are amplified one million times and connected to a light generator with automatically controlled frequency, then the light generator can often automatically select the frequency that is most suitable for his "rhythm assimilation" to give him flashing light. The feedback principle of the brain control system has been applied to some practical research. For example, during surgery, the anesthetization can be automatically controlled by the brain alternating current of the person being operated on, and people with missing arms can automatically control prosthetic hands with brain alternating current. Recently, at the Soviet pavilion of the Brussels World's Fair in Belgium, an actual performance of a prosthetic hand controlled by "thought" was performed.

    Combining cutting-edge scientific theories to study the brain control system

    In short, the brain, this "highest form of material organization," is magnificent, complex, and fascinating. But unfortunately, whether from the perspective of neurophysiology, psychology, or cybernetics, it can only be said that it is basically still an uncultivated virgin land. The knowledge we have now about the brain is fragmented, piecemeal, often more indirect than direct, and more speculation than certainty. However, we believe that one day the secrets of the brain will be basically or completely revealed. The microcosm, the universe, and the brain are the three major secrets of nature. The first involves the structure of matter, the second involves the origin of the universe, and the third involves the origin of consciousness. We are now quite unbalanced in the degree of revealing these three major secrets; but only after these three are gradually revealed can human understanding of nature be said to be complete and comprehensive. Cybernetics inspires us to reveal mechanisms as complex as the brain, which should not only be the work of neurophysiologists and psychologists, but must be jointly carried out with physicists, chemists, and mathematicians. We must not only study the human brain, but also study the living simulation of the brain and the physical simulation of the brain. The reason why we want to "unite" with physicists, chemists, and mathematicians is not only to use the achievements of modern physics and chemistry, but more importantly, how to prevent our thinking from being completely limited to a narrow professional scope. For example, starting from a narrow specialty, some psychologists often completely oppose the human brain and the living simulation of the brain, as if there cannot and should not be any common laws between them. Starting from a narrow specialty, some neurophysiologists also often draw a clear line between the research on the living body of the brain and the physical simulation, always feeling that the simulation is only an approximation, and cannot see that the research on the living body is actually only a simulation in many cases. Someone said that the entire muscle neurology theory mainly comes from the living simulation of frogs; the entire advanced nerve activity theory mainly comes from the living simulation of dogs. I think there is a lot to think about in it. The development of modern science is both moving towards analysis and synthesis, and the most valuable thing is to constantly supplement new ideas.

    Combining cutting-edge scientific theories and technologies to study the brain control system has broad prospects. Relying on the help of non-numerical and analog computing technologies, on the one hand, we can analyze and reveal the mechanisms and laws of the brain control system, and on the other hand, we can use quantitative theory to rigorously test the mechanisms and laws that have been revealed by the human brain and the living simulation of the brain. For example, we already know that the alternating current phenomenon of animal and human brains is very complex, with six or seven different types of waves, and the currently commonly used electroencephalogram recorders at home and abroad can only record this single complex wave that is mixed together, so although results are obtained, they are often unable to be analyzed, which currently seriously affects the practical value of electroencephalogram recorders in research and clinical work. But if we use a filter network device or a storage device, we can automatically analyze these six or seven different alternating current waves while recording a single complex wave. If we then use an integration device and a control device, we can also automatically calculate the amplitude of each wave and the number of its integral pulses, which greatly improves the ability to analyze or reveal brain mechanisms. For example, at present, brain electrical research at home and abroad generally uses frequency and amplitude to represent it statically, but if we use the points of a television camera tube to represent or simulate the points of our cerebral cortex, then we may be able to dynamically observe the activity of the entire cerebral cortex under various different physiological and psychological conditions. In addition, we now have sufficient reason to believe that the research on brain memory and thinking processes will have important inspiration for the comparison and improvement of storage systems in electronic computing technology and the problem of program design automation, and the research on brain automatic control and its feedback principle will in the near future enable people with missing limbs to drive cars and enable scientists' prosthetic hands to work freely on the seabed or satellites.

    控制论与大脑
    刘世熠
    大脑——最高运动形式的物质组织
    大脑是人类一切知识与智慧的器官。人们通过大脑的活动，认识客观世界，创造科学。但就二十世纪六十年代的今天来说，我们对于大脑的科学了解达到了怎样的水平呢？正如俄罗斯唯物主义哲学家别林斯基曾经问过的：“智慧的作用，即智慧的活动，是大脑器官活动的结果。但是有谁在我们智慧活动时，窥探到了这个器官的动作呢？是不是总有一天会明察这种活动呢？”
    对于动物与人类大脑的科学了解，可以说是从1870年开始（巴甫洛夫语）。自凯姆拜耳与勃洛特门首先用组织学法，佛烈希与达尼洛夫斯基等首先用刺激或截除皮质法，卡东与贝格尔第一个分别在动物与人类用脑电描记法及巴甫洛夫第一个用条件反射法研究大脑以来，已有近百年的历史。从一个方面，一个角度或一个学科来说，已经获得了一定的成绩，积累了数以千计或万计的研究文献。但就整体、全面来说，我们对于物质组织的最高形式——大脑——这一壮丽而复杂的机能的了解，还十分不够，还仅仅是万米长跑的第一二个圈。
    我们现在知道，大脑是大约由百亿以上的神经细胞组成的。大脑皮质分六层，最主要的锥体细胞居第五层。大脑皮质有定位作用，譬如视觉位枕叶的17、18、19三区（勃洛特门区）。大脑皮质有α（每秒8至13次），β（每秒14至30次），δ（每秒0.5至3次）与θ（每秒4至7次）等六七种交流电波。α波较多出现在大脑皮质的后半部，β波较多出现在大脑皮质的前半部，δ波在人们酣睡时最易出现，θ波则在二至五岁的孩子最显著。大脑能建立暂时联系，有兴奋与抑制，分化与综合，扩散与集中等规律。但我们现在还不知道大脑的计算元件（神经细胞）到底有些什么样的“特性曲线”。神经生理学家对于大脑交流电波起源问题尚在争辩中。同时目前世界上还没有一个人能告诉你暂时联系到底在大脑中是经过那些神经细胞来具体接通的。
    控制论研究不同领域中控制与联系过程的一般原则与相似性
    控制论是一门年轻的科学。自从1948年诺·维纳尔写成第一册“控制论——或动物与机器中的控制与通讯的理论”一书到现在，不过十一年。但是自动化技术和电子计算技术的成就已如此惊人，它们对于人类生活的影响已被称为“将引起第二次产业革命”。控制论既然研究在十分不同的领域中控制与联系过程的一般原则与相似性，使得人们对电子计算机与大脑的类同或比拟的研究发生很大兴趣那就是十分自然的了。现在有越来越多的神经生理学与心理学工作者肯定了用量的理论来研究大脑的重要性与可能性，也有越来越多的数学工作者肯定了大脑控制与信息传递研究对控制论的重要意义。从控制论的角度来说，大脑的确是控制系统研究的一个方面，而且也许是自然界一切控制系统中最完善、最复杂、研究起来也最困难的一个方面。
    粗略地说，我们人体是由639块肌肉、206根骨骼、105个骨杠杆或滑车、四百余万条边周神经纤维及神经中枢的约一百四十亿神经细胞组成的。人类的感觉过程（如视，听，嗅，冷，热等）与行为的控制过程（如直立，行走，书写，语言等）都是由传入或传出的一系列神经脉冲控制的。客观世界的各种刺激物全无例外地必须转变成神经脉冲后，才能使人感受，而这些脉冲同数字电子计算机中的电子脉冲相似，基本上服从同一的“全或无”（即二进位制。0与1）及“脉冲调频”规律。在上述四百余万边周神经纤维中，二眼各占约一百万条，二耳各占约三万条。若平均每根神经纤维每秒能传输三百脉冲，则从二眼最高可传输约六亿个二进位数，从二耳最高可传输约一千八百万个二进位数。当然这样计算也许不完全恰当，但由是可知人类视觉所可能传递的最大的信息量约占大脑控制系统的一半，比听觉的可能最大信息量大三十倍。这便说明了视觉在人类反映客观事物中所占有的特殊地位，是可以找到组织学与数学的客观根据的。神经中枢的一百四十亿神经细胞是多种多样的，而且关系密切。有人研究大脑的神经细胞可与一千个邻居发生信息传递关系（克莱葛与泰姆泼莱），这些神经细胞的外部较内部带0.07伏正电荷，每一厘米平方神经细胞约含1微法电容（马克洛西）。因为神经细胞所具有的物理化学性质及神经脉冲经过每一个突触所需的一定延搁（约1毫秒），因此神经脉冲的传速要比电子计算机中脉冲慢得多。现在电子学家正在设计每秒能运算五十万次12×15个数字的快速数字电子计算机，但神经脉冲的传导频率一般最高不超过每秒四，五百次。除小脑外，神经中枢的交流电波很少有达到每秒百次以上的，而大脑皮质最主要的α波每秒频率仅8至13次。研究动物的大脑皮质，得知若干兴奋的传导一般不超过每秒15至20毫米，所谓“扩散的抑制波”更慢至每分仅传导3毫米。心理学家研究人类在实际生活中的信息传递的速度，发现最高也不过每秒25个二进位数。但研究人类信息传递而一味追求二进位制的多寡是未必正确的，因为人类认识与记忆过程各循有一定的法则或模式。这些法则或模式我们每个人都有，但我们每个人都未必能完全意识到它们的存在。我们运算8×99，当然决不会像数字计算机那样笨拙地先化成二进位制，也不必较不笨拙地直接用8来乘99，因为很多人只要用100×8再减去8，一算便得。顺便指出，发现及创造人类在实际生活信息传递中的最佳法则或模式，将大大提高人在实践中的效率。大脑控制系统的反馈原则，我们若用神经中枢代表控制器，用肌肉代表运算器，用运动神经纤维代表指令的传出，则感觉神经纤维的另一个意义便代表反馈的传入。因为人体感觉神经纤维较运动神经纤维约多五倍，因此反馈的信息量比较宽裕，即使损伤了部分感觉纤维，中枢往往仍能执行有效的控制。但人体反馈不仅是神经的物理作用，人体尚有约二亿微血管，全长约十万公里；同时尚有六种主要的内分泌腺，因此反馈常有血液与内分泌的作用参加。大脑控制系统的反馈原则是颇有一些实验可作的。我们知道大脑皮质交流电有“节律同化”现象，即如果给一个人每秒4至60次的闪光刺激，那么在他的大脑皮质上就有可能出现与刺激频率相吻合的每秒4至60次的交流电波，也有可能使他感到与刺激频率相适应的颜色幻觉。如果利用自动装置，将记录电极放置在他的大脑皮质枕叶部位，将他的脑电脉冲放大一百万倍接入自动控制频率的光发生器，则该光发生器往往能自动选择最适合他“节律同化”的频率给他闪光。大脑控制系统的反馈原则已被应用在一些实践的研究上。譬如举行外科手术时可借被手术者大脑交流电自动控制麻醉及缺手臂者借大脑交流电自动控制假手等。最近在比利时布鲁塞尔世界博览会的苏联陈列馆内就作了“思维”控制假手的实际表演。
    结合尖端科学理论，研究大脑控制系统
    总而言之，大脑这块“最高运动形式的物质组织”是壮丽的，复杂的，引人入胜的。但可惜无论从神经生理学、心理学或控制论的角度来看，都只能说它基本上还是块未被开垦的处女地。我们现在所掌握的有关大脑的知识还是片断的，零碎的，往往间接多于直接，推测多于确定。但是，我们相信，总有一天会基本或完全揭露大脑的秘密的。微观世界、宇宙与大脑是大自然的三大秘密。第一个涉及物质结构问题，第二个涉及宇宙起源问题，第三个涉及意识起源问题。我们现在对于这三大秘密的揭露程度是颇不平衡的；但也只有这三者逐渐都被揭露后，人类对大自然的认识才能够说是完整的与全面的。控制论启示我们揭露像大脑那样复杂的机能，这不应该仅仅是神经生理学家与心理学家的工作，而必须与物理学家、化学家及数学家联合起来，共同进行。我们不仅要研究人类的大脑，也要研究大脑活体的模拟与大脑物理的模拟。所以要同物理学家、化学家及数学家“联合起来”，并不仅仅是要利用近代物理与化学的成就，更重要的是如何使我们的思想不完全局限在狭窄的专业范围之内。比如从狭窄的专业出发，若干心理学家往往将人类的大脑与大脑的活体模拟完全对立起来，仿佛在它们之间不可能也不应该存在任何共同规律。从狭窄的专业出发，若干神经生理学家也往往在大脑活体的研究与物理模拟间划一截然的界线，总觉得模拟不过是一种近似，看不到活体研究在许多情况下实际上也不过是一种模拟。有人说全部肌肉神经学说，主要来自青蛙的活体模拟；全部高级神经活动学说，主要来自犬的活体模拟。我看其中不乏令人深思之处。近代科学的发展既走向分析，也走向综合，而最可贵的是不断补充新的思想。
    结合尖端科学理论与技术来研究大脑控制系统，有着广阔的前途。依靠不要数字和模拟计算技术的帮助，一方面可以分析与揭露大脑控制系统的机制与规律，另一方面可以用量的理论严格检验人类大脑与大脑活体模拟所已被揭露的机制与规律。譬如我们已经知道动物与人类大脑交流电现象十分复杂，有六、七种不同的电波，而目前国内外所通用的脑电波记录器仅能描记该混扰在一起的单个复杂电波，因此虽得结果而往往无法进行分析，这在目前严重地影响了脑电波记录器在研究与临床工作中的实际价值。但我们若利用滤波网路装置或存储装置，便可在描记单个复杂电波同时，自动分析出这六、七种不同的交流电波，我们若再利用积分装置与控制装置，则又可自动算出各该电波的振幅及其求积脉冲的数目，大大提高了分析或揭露大脑机制的能力。再譬如目前国内外脑电研究，一般都静态地用频率与振幅来表示，但我们若利用电视摄象管的各点来表示或模拟我们大脑皮质的各点，则我们便有可能动态地直接观察人在各种不同生理与心理条件下的整个大脑皮质的活动。此外，我们现在已有充分理由相信，大脑记忆与思惟过程的研究将对电子计算技术中的存储系统的对比与改进及程序设计自动化问题有重要的启发作用，而大脑自动控制及其反馈原则的研究在不久的将来将可使四肢残缺者操纵汽车及使科学家的假手在海底或卫星上自由工作。
