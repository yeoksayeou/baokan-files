Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 11th—The Tuntian Coal Mine of the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau in Shandong, which has maintained the glorious title of "Ten Thousand Ton Mine" for four consecutive months, achieved a flying start in the first season of the third quarter. From the 1st to the 8th, the average daily coal output exceeded the planned target by 2%; in terms of tunneling, the recoverable period for coal volume reached more than five months. Now, all the mine's employees are advancing victoriously, determined to complete the production tasks for the third quarter ahead of schedule and exceed the quota, responding to the competition initiative proposed by the workers of the Jingxi and other mining bureaus.

As early as late June, the Tuntian Coal Mine discussed and formulated the production plan for the third quarter from the bottom up, and decided to further promote the experience of large-scale bumper harvests in the previous four months as a guarantee for the comprehensive completion of the third-quarter plan. The mine concluded from several months of practical work that organizing large-scale bumper harvests is the key to promoting tunneling, mechanical and electrical engineering, transportation, hoisting and other tasks, and ensuring the comprehensive completion of tasks. In order to meet the needs of large-scale bumper harvests, they concentrated superior forces to quickly tunnel, and also adopted the method of counter-tunneling in the level roadways, quickly reversing the passive situation of backward tunneling. In terms of underground transportation, effective measures such as rapid relocation and regular preventive maintenance were also taken, so that the underground coal chutes basically maintained normal operation.

Adhering to regular periodic evaluations is an effective way to keep the vast number of employees in high spirits. Since March, the Tuntian Coal Mine has insisted on publishing the completion of planned targets by various work teams every day, conducting evaluations every five or ten days, establishing pacesetters, and promoting all-round progress. At the same time, mine leaders also take turns going down to the mine every day to direct production on site and solve problems in a timely manner. The mine also tried every possible means to improve the workers' meals and living conditions, so that workers could eat well and live well.

    田屯煤矿乘胜前进
    决心超额完成季度计划
    新华社济南11日电　连续四个月保持万吨矿光荣称号的山东枣庄矿务局田屯煤矿，第三季季首又旗开得胜，1日到8日煤炭平均日产量超过计划指标2％；在掘进方面，获得煤量的可采期限也达到了五个多月。现在全矿职工正在乘胜前进，决心提前超额完成第三季度的生产任务，响应京西等矿务局职工所提出的竞赛倡议。
    早在6月下旬，田屯煤矿就由下而上地讨论和制订了第三季度的生产计划，并且决定进一步推行前四个月大面积丰产的经验，作为全面完成第三季度计划的保证。这个矿从几个月的实际工作中得出结论，组织大面积丰产，是推动掘进、机电、运输、提升等各项工作前进，确保全面完成任务的关键。为适应大面积丰产的需要，他们集中优势力量快速掘进，平巷还采用对穿掘进的方法，迅速扭转了掘进落后的被动局面。在井下运输工作方面，也采取了快速移装、定期进行预防性维修等有效办法，使井下运煤的溜子基本保持了正常运转。
    坚持经常定期评比，是使广大职工始终保持饱满情绪的有效方法。从3月份以来，田屯煤矿一直坚持每天公布各班组完成计划指标的情况，五天或十天一评比，树立标兵，推动全面。同时，矿上领导干部也每天轮流到井下现场指挥生产，发现问题及时解决。矿上并且多方设法改善工人的伙食和居住条件，使工人吃好住好。
