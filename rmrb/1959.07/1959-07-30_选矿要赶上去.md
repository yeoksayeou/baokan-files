The National Conference on Ore Dressing of Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Metals has put forward a requirement to all ore dressing workers, which is to comprehensively improve the four major technical and economic indicators of ore dressing production (namely, ore dressing metal recovery rate, concentrate grade, grinding mill utilization coefficient, and equipment operation rate) in order to increase the production of more metals to meet the needs of various aspects of our country's construction.

The development of various metal ore dressing production in our country is very rapid, and output has increased year by year. Taking the output of iron concentrate as an example, the output from January to June this year increased by more than 60% compared with the same period last year, and copper concentrate increased by more than 20%. However, with the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the country's demand for metals has also increased. How can the output of various metals be rapidly increased? This depends on whether the ore dressing work can keep up. Generally speaking, the grade of ferrous and non-ferrous metal mines in our country is relatively low, and they need to be refined before they can be smelted. At present, metal ore dressing production is still a weak link. It is necessary to fully tap the production potential of existing ore dressing plants so that each machine can achieve high output and good quality.

Comprehensively realizing the four major ore dressing indicators is of great significance for completing and overfulfilling this year's national plan and further reducing production costs. At present, the grinding mill utilization coefficient of advanced units has reached more than four tons per cubic meter per hour, while some units only reach 2.5 to 3 tons. If these units also reach the level of advanced units, the output can be increased by more than a quarter. As for improving the ore dressing recovery rate and concentrate grade, its significance is even greater. For every 1% increase in the grade of iron concentrate, the blast furnace can increase the production of pig iron by 2%. This is only in terms of the increased figures. If the equipment, transportation, and other costs required for the increased production are added together, the calculation will be much greater.

The practical experience of Tongguanshan Copper Mine in Anhui Province, Nanfen in Benxi, Shouwangfen in Hebei, and Daye Ore Dressing Plant in Hubei proves that fully considering existing conditions and tapping the internal potential of enterprises is a shortcut to achieving the four major indicators of ore dressing production. The metal recovery rate of copper concentrate at Tongguanshan Copper Mine in May and June increased by 2% compared with January to April, and the grade of copper concentrate increased by 50.64%. The utilization coefficient of grinding mills and the operating rate of equipment have greatly improved compared with the same period last year. In the past, the ore dressing production of Tongguanshan Copper Mine was not so outstanding. In the first quarter of this year, they adopted the practice of using the virtual to lead the real and discussing the virtual based on the real, greatly broke down conservative thinking, and actively improved the ore dressing process and operating conditions, and miracles were constantly created. This gives us an important inspiration that in the struggle for production, although the conditions are different and the levels are different, as long as there is a spirit of continuous revolution, it can continuously leap forward on the original basis.

Of course, there are many ways to improve ore dressing production, such as improving some equipment, strengthening equipment maintenance, carrying out experimental research work, and taking effective measures to overcome the weak links that appear after increasing output and quality in a timely manner. These are all the work that needs to be done to realize the great leap forward in ore dressing production.

### 选矿要赶上去

    选矿要赶上去
    全国黑色、有色金属选矿会议，向全体选矿职工提出了一项要求，这就是要全面提高选矿生产的四大技术经济指标（即选矿金属回收率，精矿品位、磨矿机利用系数和设备运转率）以增产更多的金属来满足我国各方面建设的需要。
    我国各种金属选矿生产的发展很快，产量逐年提高。从铁精矿产量来看，今年1至6月份就比去年同期提高了60％以上，铜精矿提高了20％以上。但是，随着工农业的大跃进，国家对金属的需要量也增大起来。如何迅速提高各种金属的产量呢？这就要看选矿工作能不能紧跟上去。我国黑色、有色金属矿，一般说来，品位较低，需要进行精选，才能入炉冶炼，而目前金属选矿的生产还是一个薄弱环节。必须充分发挥现有选矿厂的生产潜力，使每台机器都能做到产量高，质量好。
    全面实现选矿四大指标，对完成和超额完成今年的国家计划和进一步降低生产成本有着重大的意义。目前，先进单位的磨矿机利用系数已达每立方米每小时四吨以上，而有些单位只达到二点五到三吨，如果这些单位也达到先进单位的水平，则可以提高产量四分之一以上。至于提高选矿回收率和精矿品位，它的意义就更大了。铁精矿品位每提高1％，便可使高炉增产生铁2％。这仅仅是从增长的数字上说的，如果再把增加部分产量所需要的设备、运输等费用加在一起，这笔账就要大得多了。
    安徽省铜官山铜矿、本溪的南芬、河北寿王坟及湖北大冶选矿厂的实际经验证明，充分考虑现有的条件，挖掘企业内部潜力，是实现选矿生产四大指标的一条捷径。铜官山铜矿5、6月份铜精矿金属回收率就比1至4月份提高2％，铜精矿品位提高了50.64％。磨矿机利用系数和设备作业率比去年同期都有了很大的提高。过去，铜官山铜矿的选矿生产并不是那么出色的。今年第一季度，他们采取以虚带实，就实论虚的做法，大破保守思想，积极改进选矿流程和作业条件，奇迹就不断创造出来。由此，给予我们一个重要的启发，在生产斗争中，尽管条件不同，水平不一，但是只要具有不断革命的精神，它就可以在原有基础上不断跃进。
    当然，提高选矿生产的办法很多，比如，需要改进一些设备，加强设备维护，开展试验研究工作，采取有效措施，及时克服提高产量、质量后出现的薄弱环节等等。这些都是为实现选矿生产大跃进需要作好的工作。
