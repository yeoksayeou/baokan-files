    For a long time, Zhuge Liang has been, in the eyes of the masses, simply the embodiment of wisdom. In the struggle for production and the class struggle, the masses urgently need all kinds of wisdom, and therefore fervently admire those with high wisdom. The author of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" grasped this psychology and portrayed Zhuge Liang as a superman who knew everything about astronomy and geography, was versed in all three religions and nine streams of thought, predicted things like a god, and calculated without fail, creating a prominent object of mass wisdom worship. As the saying goes, "Three cobblers are better than one Zhuge Liang"; now there are small meetings on various fronts called "Zhuge Liang Meetings": this shows that the masses believe in their own wisdom and think that problems can be solved as long as they pool their wisdom.
      The description of Zhuge Liang in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", although containing literary exaggeration, is not without basis. Chen Shou's "Records of the Three Kingdoms" records the famous "Longzhong Plan," which shows that Zhuge Liang was good at observing the situation before he left his thatched cottage and had foreseen the situation of tripartite division, and later events were largely as he expected. When Liu Bei fled to Xiakou, "Liang said, 'The matter is urgent, please be ordered to seek help from General Sun (Quan).'" He analyzed the situation to Sun Quan, explained the advantages and disadvantages, and stimulated him with righteousness, prompting Sun Wu to cooperate in resisting Cao, and finally won the great victory of the Battle of Red Cliffs. In the third year of Jianxing during the Later Ruler’s reign, Liang led his troops to conquer the South, and by autumn, the South Central region was completely pacified. In the middle there is the story of "Seven Captures of Meng Huo." After the victory, he resolutely employed its leaders and did not appoint other officials, saying that he wanted to "not leave troops, not transport grain, and the discipline would be roughly established, and the Yi and Han would be roughly at peace." These are the reasons why Zhuge Liang is Zhuge Liang.
    However, there is another situation. When people criticize or accuse those who have done things badly or not well enough, they often hear the sarcasm of "Hindsight is 20/20, who wouldn't?" from the parties involved or bystanders. It seems that "Hindsight is 20/20" is worthless. Of course, we don't need those insincere, fake "Zhuge Liangs," whether "before" or "after" the event. But if it is a well-intentioned help to sum up the experience and lessons so as to correct mistakes in time, the so-called "Hindsight is 20/20" should not only not be ridiculed, but should also be welcomed. Because:
    First, it should be known that the historical Zhuge Liang was not only widely wise, but also known for his prudence. He himself was very confident and said, "The late emperor considered me prudent, so he entrusted me with major matters at his death" (see *Chu Shi Biao*). Later generations also gave him the evaluation of "Zhuge was cautious throughout his life." Only with prudence can one "fear when facing things, be good at planning and achieve success," fully consider problems beforehand, and humbly accept lessons afterwards. *Records of the Three Kingdoms* says, "Liang was always worried that the food supply would not be able to sustain his ambitions, so he divided his troops to cultivate land as a basis for long-term residence. The farmers were mixed among the residents of the Wei River, and the people lived in peace, and the army had no private affairs." From this, it can be seen that the plan of land cultivation was determined after accepting the lessons of repeated failures (including the fact that the wooden ox and flowing horse did not solve the problem of grain transportation). This shows that even the "resourceful and decisive" Zhuge Liang had more than once shown himself to be a hindsight Zhuge Liang. In fact, being a hindsight Zhuge Liang is not enough to prove the unwisdom of the prior Zhuge Liang, and due to summarizing work and accepting lessons, it is enough to expand the wisdom of his prior Zhuge Liang. All in all, hindsight Zhuge Liang and prior Zhuge Liang are dialectically unified.
    Han Fei said, "When the world changes, things change," "When things change, preparations change," "Therefore, the sage does not expect to follow the old, does not follow constant practice, discusses the affairs of the world, and prepares for it accordingly" (*Five Vermin*). Zhuge Liang often compared himself to Guan Zhong and Yue Yi, while Chen Shou called him "comparable to Guan (Zhong) and Xiao (He)." In governing Shu, he reversed Liu Zhang's waste and advocated strictness and clarity. It seems that he belonged to the Legalist school or took something from Han Fei.
    Second, due to the passage of time and changes in the situation, conditions are bound to change. From the perspective of development, hindsight is very important. If we do not check and summarize our work at any time, our working methods will not be able to keep up with and adapt to the objective conditions that have already changed, and we will make big mistakes. Chairman Mao has a passage that is very good, concise, and specific, which is now quoted below:
    "...However, generally speaking, whether in the practice of changing nature or changing society, there are very few things in which people's original ideas, theories, plans, and programs are realized without any change. This is because those who are engaged in changing reality are often subject to many restrictions, not only to scientific and technological conditions, but also to the development of the objective process and the degree of its manifestation (the aspects and essence of the objective process have not been fully exposed). Under such circumstances, it is common for ideas, theories, plans, and programs to be partially changed due to the discovery of unforeseen circumstances in practice, and it is also possible for them to be completely changed. That is to say, it is possible for the original ideas, theories, plans, and programs to be partially or completely inconsistent with reality, partially wrong or completely wrong. Many times, it is necessary to fail repeatedly before correcting wrong understandings, before reaching conformity with the laws of the objective process, and thus being able to transform subjective things into objective things, that is, to obtain the expected results in practice." (*Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, pages 282-283) Originally, the dialectical development of the objective world (including society) is endless, and therefore our subjective movement of understanding that reflects the development of the objective world and its laws cannot have an end. Therefore, it is said that "Marxism-Leninism has not ended the truth, but is constantly opening up the path to knowing the truth in practice." (*Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 284) However, in the practice of transforming the world, we can and must reasonably divide it into several stages of development according to the nature of objective reality and subjective requirements, and divide a certain stage of development into several small objective processes. Before a stage or a small process begins, it is "before the event"; after a stage or a small process ends, it is "after the event." Although "it is common for thought to lag behind reality," we can strive to accurately or nearly accurately grasp the laws of development of objective things in order to avoid making mistakes or making fewer mistakes, which depends on carefully and thoroughly "creating ideas, theories, plans, and programs that correspond to the laws of the practical process" beforehand, which is called prior Zhuge Liang. But since "it is common for thought to lag behind reality," then, after the event, we must conduct a thorough and detailed check and summary to see whether the results of practice conform to objective reality, so as to derive the experience or lessons of the work, and use this to guide re-practice. This cycle repeats, the work develops forward, and our ability also increases accordingly. From this point of view, hindsight Zhuge Liang is not less important than prior Zhuge Liang for practice. Chairman Mao's above instructions emphasize this point.
    Third, the check and summary of practice, that is, hindsight Zhuge Liang, from the perspective of the cognitive process, is an inevitable requirement of the Marxist-Leninist theory of knowledge, constituting its indispensable link, that is to say, it has a epistemological basis. Chairman Mao summarized the rich experience of the Chinese revolution and scientifically summarized the principles of Marxist epistemology into such a formula:
    "Practice, knowledge, re-practice, re-knowledge, this form, cycles repeatedly to infinity, and the content of each cycle of practice and knowledge has progressed to a higher level." (*Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, Volume 1, page 285)
    The Marxist theory of knowledge believes that knowledge comes from practice, and practice is the criterion of truth. Therefore, it is said that "discover truth through practice, and then confirm and develop truth through practice." (Ibid.) Therefore, the ideas, theories, plans, and programs created by the truth discovered based on practice must be put into practice—re-practice—to see whether they conform to objective reality, in order to obtain a higher level of knowledge—re-knowledge. If after putting it into practice, you do not check and do not summarize, how can you know the result of the practice, whether it is a success or a failure? Why is it able to succeed? Why does it fail? If this is not done, the re-knowledge that has "progressed to a higher level" will fall through; the development of all science and culture will be hindered. From this, it can be seen that some thoughtless lazy people who belittle the inspection and summary of work, or regard it as an extra burden, are wrong. The famous formula of "practice, knowledge, re-practice, re-knowledge" itself embodies the unity of "prior Zhuge Liang" and "hindsight Zhuge Liang."

    也谈“事后诸葛亮”
    杜守素
    由来已久，诸葛亮在广大群众的眼睛里，简直就是智慧的化身。在生产斗争和阶级斗争中，群众迫切需要各色各样的智慧，因而也热烈地崇拜具有高度智慧的人。“三国演义”的作者掌握了这种心理，更把诸葛亮描写成天文地理无所不通、三教九流无所不晓、料事如神、算无遗策的超人，造成群众智慧崇拜的突出的对象。俗话说，“三个臭皮匠，胜过一个诸葛亮”；现在各个战线上都有一种小会，叫做“诸葛亮会”：这又表示了群众相信自己的智慧，认为只要集思广益就能够解决问题。
      “三国演义”里面对于诸葛亮的描写，虽然含有文学上的夸张，但不是毫无根据的。陈寿的“三国志”记述了有名的“隆中对”，说明诸葛亮未出茅庐，就善于观察形势，早料定三分割据的局面，后来的事实，大体如他所料。刘备败走夏口，“亮曰，事急矣，请奉命求救于孙将军（权）。”因向孙权分析形势，开陈利害，并激以正义，促成孙吴合作抗曹，终于取得赤壁之役的大胜利。后主建兴三年，亮率众南征，及秋南中悉平。中间有“七纵七擒（孟获）”的故事。胜利后毅然录用其渠率（帅），不另置官吏，说是要使“不留兵，不运粮，而纲纪粗定，夷汉粗安。”这些都是诸葛亮之所以为诸葛亮。
    但是，另有一种情况。当人们对于那些把事情做坏了，或者做得不够好的人提出指责或批评的时候，往往从当事人或旁观者那里听到
  “事后诸葛亮，谁不会？”的嘲讽。仿佛“事后诸葛亮”是一钱不值的。当然，对于那些不怀好意的、冒牌的“诸葛亮”，不管其为“事前”“事后”，我们都不需要。但倘若是善意的帮助总结经验教训，以便及时改正错误的所谓“事后诸葛亮”，那是不但不应当受到嘲讽，而且应当受到欢迎。因为：
    第一，要知道历史上的诸葛亮，一面是广有智慧，另一面也以谨慎著称。他自己就很自信地说过，“先帝以臣谨慎，故临终寄臣以大事”（见出师表）。而后人也给以“诸葛一生惟谨慎”的评语。谨慎，才能够“临事而惧，好谋而成”，才能够全面考虑问题于事前，虚心接受教训于事后。三国志说，“亮每患粮不继使己志不伸，是以分兵屯田为久住之基，耕者杂于渭滨居民之间，而百姓安堵，军无私焉。”由此可见，屯田之计，是接受了屡次失败的教训（包括木牛流马没有解决运粮问题）而定下来的。这说明就在“多谋善断”的诸葛亮，也还有不只一次地表现为事后诸葛亮的时候。其实，现身为事后诸葛亮，并不足以证明事前诸葛亮的不智，而由于总结工作、接受教训，反足以扩充其事前诸葛亮的智慧。总而言之，事后诸葛亮与事前诸葛亮是辩证的统一的。
    韩非说，“世异则事异”，“事异则备变”，“是以圣人不期修（循）古，不法常行，论世之事，因为之备”（五蠹篇）。诸葛亮每自比管仲乐毅，而陈寿则称为“管（仲）萧（何）之亚匹”，他治蜀，一反刘璋之废弛而尚严明，看来当属法家，或者也有取于韩非吧。
    第二，由于时移、势易，条件必然发生变化，从发展的观点来说，事后诸葛亮很是重要。如果不随时检查和总结工作，我们的工作方法就不能够跟上去适应那已经变化了的客观条件，就要犯大错误。毛主席有一段话说得真好，又扼要，又具体，现在引在下面：
    “……然而一般地说来，不论在变革自然或变革社会的实践中，人们原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，毫无改变地实现出来的事，是很少的。这是因为从事变革现实的人们，常常受着许多的限制，不但常常受着科学条件和技术条件的限制，而且也受着客观过程的发展及其表现程度的限制（客观过程的方面及本质尚未充分暴露）。在这种情形之下，由于实践中发现前所未料的情况，因而部分地改变思想、理论、计划、方案的事是常有的，全部地改变的事也是有的。即是说，原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，部分地或全部地不合于实际，部分错了或全部错了的事，都是有的。许多时候须反复失败过多次，才能纠正错误的认识，才能到达于和客观过程的规律性相符合，因而才能够变主观的东西为客观的东西，即在实践中得到预想的结果。（“毛泽东选集”第一卷、二八二——二八三页）本来，客观世界（包含社会）的辩证的发展是没有止境的，因而我们反映客观世界发展及其规律的主观认识运动也就不能有止境。所以说，“马克思列宁主义并没有结束真理，而是在实践中不断地开辟认识真理的道路。”（“毛泽东选集”第一卷、二八四页）可是，我们在变革世界的实践中，却可以、也必须按照客观现实的性质和主观的要求，合理地把它划分为若干发展阶段，并把某一发展阶段区分为若干小的客观过程。一个阶段或一个小过程开始之前，就是“事前”；一个阶段或一个小过程结束之后，就是“事后”。尽管“思想落后于实际的事是常有的”，但我们可以努力准确地或者接近准确地掌握客观事物的发展规律，以期做到不犯错误或少犯错误，这就得靠事前审慎周详地“造成相应于该实践过程的法则性的思想、理论、计划、方案”，这谓之事前诸葛亮。但是，既然“思想落后于实际的事是常有的”，那么，事后就必须周密细致地进行检查和总结，看看实践的结果是否符合于客观实际，从而得出工作的经验或教训，并以此指导再实践，这样循环往复，工作向前发展了，我们的能力也随之提高。这样看来，对于实践，事后诸葛亮并不比事先诸葛亮较不重要些。毛主席上述的指示，就很着重这一点。
    第三，对于实践的检查和总结，即事后诸葛亮，从认识过程说来，它是马克思列宁主义认识论必然的要求，构成其必不可缺少的环节，也就是说，它是有着认识论的根据的。毛主席总结了中国革命的丰富经验，科学地把马克思主义认识论的原理概括成为这样的一个公式：
    “实践、认识、再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。”（“毛泽东选集”第一卷、二八五页）
    马克思主义的认识论认为：认识来自实践，同时实践是真理的标准。所以说，“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理与发展真理。”（同上）因此，根据实践而发现的真理所造成的思想、理论、计划、方案，就必须付诸实施——再实践，看看它们是否符合客观实际，以期获得比较地进到高一级的认识——再认识。如果付诸实施之后，不去检查，不去总结，试问怎样能够知道该实践的结果，是成功还是失败？为什么能够成功？因什么而失败？不这样做，“比较地进到了高一级的程度”的再认识就会落空；一切科学文化的发展都会受到阻碍。由此可见，某些轻视工作的检查和总结，或把它看成额外负担的思想懒汉是错误的。“实践，认识，再实践，再认识”这个著名的公式本身，也正体现了“事前诸葛亮”与“事后诸葛亮”的统一。
