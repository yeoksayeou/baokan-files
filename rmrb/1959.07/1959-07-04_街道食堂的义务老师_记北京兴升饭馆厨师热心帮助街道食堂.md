    The Obligatory Teacher of the Street Canteen
    -- Record of Beijing Xingsheng Restaurant Chefs' Enthusiastic Help to Street Canteens
    Xiao Enhui
    In the Dashilan area, one of Beijing's bustling streets, there are seven or eight residential canteens. The cooks in these canteens are mostly housewives who have recently joined the workforce. The five cooks in the Grain Store Street Canteen are all novices. Four of them, before the canteen was established last year, only cooked simple meals at home for small families. Now, they have become "master chefs" who provide meals for 180 people, capable of making delicious and varied dishes. How did they quickly improve their cooking skills? In addition to their subjective efforts and active learning, some credit should be given to their obligatory teachers – the chefs from Xingsheng Restaurant, a red-banner unit on Beijing's finance and trade front.
    During the Great Leap Forward last year, street canteens were established one after another, and the number of people joining increased. The Party branch of Xingsheng Restaurant believed that the restaurant should find ways to help these newly established canteens consolidate and develop. After the Party branch put forward this task, the chefs discussed it happily around the red-hot stove. Some said, "Some time ago, when we discussed how the restaurant could serve production and the masses, we didn't think of this method." Others said, "Street canteens are newborn babies, and most of the people who join are workers from workshops and various industries. Helping them run the canteens well so that everyone can produce and work happily is precisely a way to serve production and the masses, isn't it?" Some raised the question, "Our restaurant is also short of staff. How can we provide specific help to others?" After discussion, it was decided that Master Ma Deming, who had been cooking for more than 20 years, would be responsible for doing a good job of helping the street canteens.
    Master Ma Deming tried his best to spare time to teach the cooks in the street canteens the techniques of stir-frying and cooking, and to help the administrators study and improve management methods. One day, when he went to the street canteen to help with cooking, he saw many vegetable leaves and roots, as well as fish and shrimp scraps, thrown into the trash can and slop bucket. Feeling very sorry, he introduced to the cooks the methods their restaurant used to utilize discarded items. For example, eggplant peels and green pepper cores, stewed and then added with scallions, ginger, and broad bean paste, could be made into five or six kinds of hot or cold dishes; kohlrabi heads and lettuce roots, boiled and then soaked in water, and then added with sweet potato starch to make dishes, tasted similar to water chestnuts. The bellies of yellow croaker, dried in the sun, could be made into "deep-fried small belly slices," which were a very good refined dish. In the canteen, he always taught the cooks hand-in-hand how to make the cuts, how to judge the heat…
    With the help of the chefs of Xingsheng Restaurant, the cooks in the canteens became more and more enthusiastic about learning techniques, and everyone asked the restaurant to "open a technical class" to explain cooking knowledge. Since last winter, every Wednesday evening, the cooks have gone to Xingsheng Restaurant to "attend classes." The old chefs of Xingsheng Restaurant, Ma Deming, Mi Pengnian, and Li Gui, have truly become teachers. But their teaching methods are different. Everyone sits together, chatting like old friends. The "teachers" tell the "students" how to make dishes well: cutting vegetables should be cut into large cubes, small cubes; slicing should be cut into large knife-ground slices, small knife-ground slices; shredding should be cut into hunchback shreds, circular shreds...; when talking about stir-frying meat dishes, they start with how to gut and scale fish, how to remove the fishy smell, and how to bring out the aroma, and then talk about how to配料 (pèiliào, mix ingredients),配色 (pèisè, match colors), pay attention to 配头 (pèitóu, garnishing), what kind of dish should be cooked to what heat, how to arrange the plates, how to change the patterns, how to achieve color, aroma, and taste, rich and varied, how to see the nutritional value of the dishes, how to save coal, reduce costs, and so on. Every time "class is in session," Master Ma Deming always points out the advantages and disadvantages he saw in the canteen, and then asks everyone to ask questions, share experiences, and study together. This kind of seminar, with rich content and flexible methods, attracts students to learn without getting tired, and they enjoy it very much. Aunt Yang, a cook in the canteen, said, "Cooking is really a university question. It's not as simple as just being able to eat. The more you learn, the more interested you become!" (Attached picture)

    街道食堂的义务老师
    ——记北京兴升饭馆厨师热心帮助街道食堂
    肖恩惠
    在北京繁华街道之一的大栅栏一带，有七、八个居民食堂。这些食堂的炊事员绝大部分是新参加工作的家庭妇女。粮食店街道食堂的五位炊事员都是新手，其中四人在去年没成立食堂时，只不过在家里做过小锅小灶的粗茶淡饭，现在却成了供一百八十人吃饭的“掌灶大师傅”，能做味美样多的饭菜。她们怎样很快提高了烹调技术呢？除了主观努力积极学习外，有一部分功劳应归之于义务老师——北京市财贸战线上的红旗单位兴升饭馆的厨师。
    去年大跃进中，街道食堂纷纷成立，入伙人数越来越多。兴升饭馆的党支部认为饭馆应设法帮助这些新生的食堂巩固发展。党支部提出这个任务后，厨师们在红红的炉火旁边乐融融的谈论着。有的说，“前些时，咱们讨论饭馆怎样为生产、为群众服务时，就没想到这个办法。”有的说，“街道食堂是新生的婴儿，入伙的人大部分是加工作坊和各行业的职工，帮助他们搞好食堂，让大家愉快的生产和工作，这不正是为生产、为群众服务的办法吗？”有的提出，“咱们饭馆的人手也很紧，怎么能给人家具体帮助呢？”经过大伙的议论，决定由做过二十多年饭的马德明老师傅负责搞好帮助街道食堂的工作。
    马德明老师傅尽量抽时间到街道食堂教炊事员炒菜、做饭的技术，帮助事务员研究改进经营管理的办法。一天，他到街道食堂帮助做饭时，看到垃圾箱、泔水缸里扔着许多蔬菜叶根和鱼虾杂水，感到很可惜，他便向炊事员们介绍了他们饭馆利用废弃东西的办法。如茄子皮、青椒心焖熟后加上葱姜和豆瓣酱等副料，可做五六种热菜或凉菜；洋白菜圪瘩、莴笋根煮熟水泡以后，加上团粉做成菜，有类似荸荠的味道。黄花鱼的肚子晒干后，做成“油炸小片肚”，是很好的细菜。他在食堂里，总是手把手地教给炊事员们怎样下刀口，怎样看火色……。
    在兴升饭馆厨师们的帮助下，食堂炊事员们学习技术的热情越来越高，大家要求饭馆“开技术课”给讲解烹饪常识。从去冬以来，每逢星期三的晚上，炊事员就到兴升馆“听课”。兴升馆的马德明、米彭年、李贵几个老厨师真正当起老师来了。但他们教课的方法却与众不同，大家坐在一起，像拉家常一样。“老师”告诉“学生”菜怎样才能做好：切菜要切成大方丁、小方丁；切片，要切成大磨刀片、小磨刀片；切丝，要切成罗锅丝、罗圈丝……；说到炒肉食时，他们就从做鱼怎样开膛去鳞，怎样去腥味、出香气说起，然后谈到怎样配料，配色，讲究配头，什么菜应该做到什么火色，怎样拼盘，怎样变花样，怎样做到色香味美，丰富多彩，怎样看菜的营养价值，怎样节约用煤、减少费用等等。每次“上课”时，马德明老师傅总要把他在食堂看到的优缺点指出来，然后让大家提问题，摆经验，互相研究。这种内容丰富、方式灵活的座谈会，把学生们吸引得学而不厌，津津乐道。食堂炊事员杨老太太说：“做饭炒菜真是一门大学问，可不是简简单单的能吃就行，越学越感到有兴趣啦！”（附图片）
