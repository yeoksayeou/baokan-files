    A Meaningful Concert
    Stalin Prize Winner, Composer Ni. Kryukov
    A significant event occurred in Beijing's cultural life on July 5th: The Central Philharmonic Orchestra and the Central Broadcasting Orchestra Choir, soloists baritone Wei Qixian, tenor Wei Mingquan, mezzo-soprano Cai Huanzhen, and soprano Liang Meizhen performed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony under the baton of Yan Liangkun. This symphony represents the pinnacle of world classical music, lauded for its profound ideological significance and the immense diversity and expressiveness of its musical colors. The final movement of the symphony uses Schiller's "Ode to Joy" as the lyrics for the soloists and choir.
    The ideological and artistic complexity of this symphony presents the performers with difficult and serious tasks: to deeply and fully understand Beethoven's philosophical ideas, and to overcome the many technical difficulties contained in the symphony's overall score.
    It is gratifying that the Chinese musicians withstood the most severe test and overcame this very arduous task. Conductor Yan Liangkun infused the performance with emotion and a deep understanding of Beethoven's great creation. He skillfully used concise gestures to demonstrate the symphony's broad and diverse imagery, and he achieved excellent coordination between the entire orchestra and the choir.
    The Central Philharmonic Orchestra symphony orchestra was also pleasing. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony requires the orchestra to have great flexibility, clear rhythm, and beautiful tone in all sections and solo instruments. All of these strengths were demonstrated.
    Perhaps it can be hoped that the orchestra can be more coordinated in terms of rhythm (especially in the second movement of the symphony) and that some phrases can be processed more finely, not allowing for any perfunctoriness at the end of these phrases.
    The finale of the symphony, performed by the combined choir of the Central Philharmonic Orchestra and the Central Broadcasting Orchestra (with Yan Liangkun himself serving as the choir conductor), left me with an excellent impression. The choir's sound was very bright, perfect, and full of emotion.
    Baritone Wei Qixian, with his majestic voice, thoughtfully sang his solo and ensemble parts, and his wonderful voice blended exquisitely with the other three soloists Wei Mingquan, Liang Meizhen, and Cai Huanzhen. This performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony undoubtedly proves the prosperity of the people's Chinese musical art, and demonstrates the great achievements of the liberated Chinese people in culture.
    Prior to the performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra symphony orchestra, conducted by Li Delun, performed the interesting orchestral work "Song of the Forest" by the Chinese composer Ma Sicong.
    I first met Ma Sicong in Prague, at the "Prague Spring" Music Festival in 1951. At one of the concerts of that music festival, Ma Sicong personally played his violin concerto with the symphony orchestra. At that time, this beautiful work received great appreciation from the audience. The exquisite Chinese melody in this concerto, developed broadly and freely by the composer, completely captivated me. However, I had some different opinions on the harmony of the concerto, namely that it seemed to have the influence of French Impressionist music.
    Ma Sicong's outstanding talent has been further developed in "Song of the Forest." This work profoundly promotes the tradition of Chinese music, and combines it with the professional skills of skilled modern composers - interesting orchestral scoring, broad contrapuntal development, and a very captivating enrichment of the Chinese pentatonic scale tradition.
    My only opinion, or rather a question for the composer, is whether the first and last movements of "Song of the Forest" are too close in mood and instrumentation.
    Under the direction of Li Delun, a talented artist who graduated from the Moscow Conservatory, the orchestra performed "Song of the Forest" with emotion and skill.
    This concert was warmly welcomed by the audience, and it powerfully demonstrated the cultural achievements of the great Chinese people - the builders of socialism. (Translated by Ding Yiwei)

    一次有意义的音乐会
    斯大林奖金获得者、作曲家　尼·克留柯夫
    7月5日在北京的文化生活中发生了一件有意义的事情：中央乐团和中央广播乐团合唱队，独唱家男中音魏启贤，男高音魏鸣泉，女中音蔡焕贞，女高音梁美珍在严良坤的指挥下演出了贝多芬的第九交响乐。这部交响乐达到了世界古典音乐的顶峰，它被赞誉为具有深刻思想意义，和音乐色彩上具有巨大的多样性和表现性的作品。交响乐的最后一个乐章是以席勒的“欢乐颂”作为独唱、合唱的歌词。
    这部交响乐的思想和艺术的复杂性给表演者提出了艰难和严重的任务：要深刻地全部了解贝多芬的哲学思想，要克服在交响乐总乐谱中所包含的许多技术上的困难。
    应该高兴的是中国音乐家们经住了最严重的考验，克服了这个非常艰巨的任务。指挥严良坤感情贯注并深刻地理解了贝多芬这部伟大的创作。他善于用简炼的手势展示出交响乐广阔的多种多样的形象，他使整个乐队和合唱达到很好的协调。
    中央乐团交响乐队也使人感到高兴。贝多芬的第九交响乐要求乐队有很大的灵活性，清晰的节奏，各组和独奏乐器上优美的音色。所有这些优点，都表现出来了。
    也许可以希望乐队在节奏方面更能协调一些（特别是交响乐的第二乐章）和对某些乐句要更精细的加工，不允许在这些乐句的结尾有一点草率。
    交响乐的终曲，由于中央乐团和中央广播乐团联合合唱队（以严良坤自己担任合唱指挥）的演唱给我留下了极好的印象。合唱队的声音非常嘹亮、完美和富有感情。
    男中音魏启贤，以他那雄伟的嗓子，富于深思地演唱了他的独唱和重唱的部分，他和其他三位独唱者魏鸣泉、梁美珍、蔡焕贞的美妙的声音绝妙地融合在一起。这次贝多芬第九交响乐的演出无疑地证明了人民中国音乐艺术的繁荣，证明了解放了的中国人民的文化获得了巨大的成就。
    在贝多芬第九交响乐演出之前，中央乐团交响乐队由李德伦指挥演出了中国作曲家马思聪的有趣的管弦乐作品“山林之歌”。
    我和马思聪第一次见面是在布拉格，1951年“布拉格之春”音乐节上。在那次音乐节的一次音乐会上，马思聪亲自演奏了自己的提琴的和交响乐队的协奏曲。当时这部优美的作品在听众中间获得了很大的赞赏。这部协奏曲中经过作者广阔而自由地发展了的绝妙的中国旋律学完全使我沉迷。但是，我对协奏曲的和声方面有些不同的意见，那就是好像它带有法国音乐印象派的影响。
    马思聪的卓越天才在
  “山林之歌”中得到了更大的发展。这部作品十分深刻地发扬了中国音乐的传统，并使它结合着熟练的现代作曲家的专业技巧——有趣的管弦乐配器，广阔的对位化的发展，非常引人入胜的丰富了中国五声音阶的传统。
    我唯一的意见，正确些说是对作曲家提出一个问题，那就是“山林之歌”的第一乐章和最后一个乐章在情绪上和配器方面是否过于接近。
    在莫斯科音乐学院毕业的、有才能的艺术家李德伦的指挥下，乐队充满感情地、熟练地演奏了“山林之歌”。
    这次音乐会受到了全场听众的热烈欢迎，它有力地证明了伟大的中国人民——社会主义建设者的文化的成就。　（丁一薇译）
