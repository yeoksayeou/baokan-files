"Red Peril" Chi Bei'ou's Poem, Ying Tao's Drawing

Africans are so audacious, daring to wear red shirts.
Are they intentionally causing trouble, or planning a rebellion?
Red is a dangerous color,
The British Empire has already suffered greatly from it.
Anyone who wears red clothing, hats, shoes, or socks,
Is regarded as a communist, and severely punished!
I only heard that bulls go mad when they see red cloth,
I didn't expect British colonialists to be the same.
Why not cut down all the roses in Kenya,
And dye all the rooster combs and harelips yellow?

Foreign news agency reports that ten Africans in Kenya were punished by the British colonial authorities for violating the "Special Clothing Act" for wearing red shirts. The colonial official handling the case said that this act of wearing red shirts had "caused peaceful disasters to other countries and Britain," and so on. (Attached picture)

    “红祸”池北偶诗　英韬画非洲人好大的胆，竟敢穿起红色衬衫，是要存心捣乱，还是打算造反？红色是危险的色采，大英帝国已经深受其害，谁要是穿上红的衣帽鞋袜，一律当共产党看待，严惩不贷！只听说蛮牛看到红布就会发狂，没想到英国殖民者也是一样。何不砍尽怯尼亚的玫瑰，把所有的鸡冠和兔唇都染黄？
    外国通讯社消息，怯尼亚十个非洲人因为穿了红衬衫，被英国殖民当局以违反“特殊服装法令”的罪名处罚。处理此案的殖民官员说，这种穿红衬衫的行为已经“给其他国家和英国导致破坏和平的灾难”云云。（附图片）
