Motherland, Give the Order!
Over 60,000 Recent Graduates Express Their Willingness to Accept Assignments

    This newspaper reports that before the state's assignment, over 60,000 recent college graduates across the country have written to the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Ministry of Education, and this newspaper's editorial department, requesting to go to the places in the motherland that are most needed and face the greatest difficulties.

    Zheng Lanqiu and other recent graduates of the Civil Engineering Department of Tsinghua University said in their letter: "When we heard from the letters of classmates who graduated last year and were assigned to Xinjiang about the scale of industrial and municipal construction in Xinjiang and the urgent need for professional cadres, how eager we were to jump into this great construction torrent!"

    "Looking back five years ago, we had just stepped into the gates of Tsinghua University. Over the past five years, under the painstaking leadership of our teachers, through theoretical and practical study, productive labor, graduation design... we have also gained a lot in terms of political thought and professional skills. Our bodies have also grown bigger, and we are all red, black, and sturdy. We are determined to go to the bustling Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, and to Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, which are undergoing earth-shaking changes. Any construction post is our battlefield."

    "Motherland, give the order! We have prepared our luggage, and we are full of pre-battle excitement, waiting for the bugle call to advance!"

    The fifth-year students of the Architecture Department of South China Institute of Technology said in their letter: "In recent years, thanks to the Party's kind teachings and meticulous care, we have understood the purpose of life and the direction of struggle. The Party has taught us to study diligently, learn humbly and practically, master our skills to build the motherland, and to use strong will and perseverance to conquer the fortress of science. The Party has taught us to continuously and consciously carry out self-transformation, improve our awareness, and become revolutionary vanguards and shock troops of socialist construction. The Party has given us great trust and great expectations, and we will never let the Party down. Before embarking on life, all our Communist Youth League members and all students in the class pledge to the Party: We will always be good children of the Party, always be loyal to the Party, listen to the Party, and go wherever the Party directs us. We earnestly request the Party to assign us to the border areas in the first batch."

    The one hundred and four graduating students of the History Department of Southwest Normal College wrote the following guarantee to the Party with a burning heart and an iron will: "It is the Party that has nurtured us into adults; it is the Party that has pointed out the direction of our struggle; it is the Party that has given us Marxist-Leninist thought; it is the Party that has given us the key to open the treasure house of knowledge. Our every bit of progress is condensed with the Party's painstaking efforts; everything we have belongs to the great Party. Please assign us to the most needed and arduous places, dear Party! We love the vast Gobi Desert, and we also love the silver-lined snow mountains; we yearn for the extremely cold northern desert, and we also yearn for the hot Hainan. We have no regional preferences; every place in the motherland that needs us is our battlefield for riding horses. We must take deep roots there and grow strong. We can correctly understand 'unity of learning and application', just as you kindly taught us. No matter what job, no matter what subject, we are happy to undertake it. Even if there are great difficulties, our answer is to do it—to do it down-to-earth and boldly."

    Furthermore, over 5,000 recent graduates from various universities in Shanghai are full of confidence and are always ready to devote themselves to the various construction undertakings of the motherland. Since April, they have been brewing and choosing their aspirations after graduation. Ye Danxia, a graduate of the Department of Architectural Engineering of Tongji University, participated in the design of the "Beijing Stadium" this spring. She felt that the great achievements of the motherland's socialist construction were too moving, and it is equally meaningful to work anywhere. Tao Xiangxing, a student in the same class as her, said: "I think every job is good and important. I want to be a researcher, and I also want to go to the construction site to do construction design work. As long as the country needs it, I will do anything."

    祖国，下命令吧！
    六万多名应届毕业生纷纷表示服从分配
    本报讯　全国高等学校六万多名应届毕业生，在国家分配以前，纷纷写信给团中央、教育部和本报编辑部，要求到祖国最需要、最困难的地方去。
    清华大学土木系应届毕业生郑兰秋等在信中说：当我们听到去年毕业分配到新疆去的同学在来信中说到新疆工业和市政建设规模之大和对专业干部需要之迫切，我们是多么急于要跃入这个大建设的洪流中去啊！
    回想起五年前，我们刚刚迈进清华园的大门，而五年来在政治思想上，在业务上也在老师的苦心领导之下，通过论理和实践的学习，生产劳动，毕业设计……也有了很多的收获。我们身体也长的更大了，个个都是红黑粗壮。我们决心到热火朝天的武钢，和起着翻天复地变化的新疆、内蒙去。任何建设岗位都是我们战斗的疆场。
    祖国，下命令吧！我们已经准备好了行装，我们满怀着战斗前的激动，等待着进军的号声！
    华南工学院建筑系五年级全体同学的信中说：几年来由于党的亲切教导和无微不至的关怀，使我们懂得了生活的目的和斗争的方向。党教导我们要刻苦钻研，虚心踏实地学习，学好本领建设祖国，要以顽强的意志，坚毅不拔的精神去攻克科学堡垒。党教导我们要不断的自觉的进行自我改造，提高觉悟，要我们成为革命的尖兵和社会主义建设的突击手。党对我们给予了极大的信任和极大的期望，我们决不辜负党对我们的信任和期望。在走向生活之前，我们全体共青团员和全班同学向党表示：永远做党的好儿女，永远忠实于党，听党的话，党指向哪里我们就奔向哪里，恳求党第一批分配我们到边疆去。
    西南师范学院历史系一百零四个应届毕业生以赤热的心、钢铁一般的意志向党写了如下的保证书：是党，把我们培养成人；是党，给我们指出了奋斗的方向；是党，给了我们马列主义的思想；是党，给了我们钥匙去打开知识的宝库。我们的点滴进步都凝聚着党的心血；我们的一切都属于伟大的党。请把我们分配到最需要最艰苦的地方去吧！亲爱的党。我们喜欢浩瀚的戈壁，也喜欢银镶的雪山；我们向往奇寒的漠北，也向往炎热的海南，我们没有地区上的选择，祖国一切需要我们的地方都是我们纵骑驰骋的战场，我们一定要在那里扎下深根，茁壮成长。我们能够正确地理解“学用一致”，像您亲切教导我们那样。无论什么工作，无论什么学科，我们都乐于承担，纵使有天大的困难，我们的回答就是干——脚踏实地、大胆地干。
    又讯　上海各大学五千多名应届毕业生都信心百倍地时刻准备投身于祖国的各种建设事业。从4月份起，他们就酝酿挑选毕业以后的志愿。同济大学建筑工程系的毕业生叶丹霞，今年春天参加“北京体育场”的方案设计，她觉得祖国的社会主义建设伟大成就太感动人了，到哪里工作都一样有意义。和她同班的学生陶祥兴说：“我觉得样样工作都好，都重要。我想当研究人员，也想到工地上去做施工设计工作，只要国家需要，让我做什么都行。”
