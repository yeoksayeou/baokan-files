Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 14th: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Gomulka, and the Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers, Cyrankiewicz, held a grand reception tonight to welcome the Soviet Party and Government delegation headed by Khrushchev.

Present at the reception were Polish party and government leaders and prominent social activists, diplomatic envoys from various countries, and representatives from all walks of life.

Khrushchev said that the alliance and friendship between our two peoples are based on the most solid ideological unity, policy consistency, and purpose. During the visit, we will exchange views with the leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party and the government on many issues of mutual interest, in order to further consolidate the comprehensive friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance between our two countries and parties; and will discuss some measures aimed at easing international tensions and preventing new wars.
