Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 4th: President Sukarno continued to hold meetings today with responsible military and government officials. Participants in the meeting included Prime Minister Djuanda, Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Nasution, Vice Chairman of the National Council Abdoelgani, Minister of State Yamin, and Supreme Court President Wirjono.

No announcement was made regarding the issues discussed during the meeting.

The Ministry of Information notified reporters today that President Sukarno will announce his important decision tomorrow afternoon.

President Sukarno notified the cabinet meeting on the 3rd that he would take action on the restoration of the 1945 Constitution in a short period of time. President Sukarno held a meeting with the cabinet for nearly an hour that day. Information Minister Sudibjo said after the meeting that President Sukarno had decided to take clear measures on the restoration of the 1945 Constitution in a short period of time.

The Indonesian Nationalist Party issued a statement again demanding that President Sukarno issue a decree to restore the 1945 Constitution. The statement also ordered the Nationalist Party members of the Constituent Assembly not to attend any meetings that the Constituent Assembly may convene. This is another measure taken by the Nationalist Party to demand the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly.

This statement was given to President Sukarno by Suwirjo, the chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, in Bogor yesterday before the military and political leaders' meeting.

Zodi Gondokusumo, a spokesman for the Front for the Defense of the 1945 Declaration of Independence, said after a meeting held by the front on the evening of the 3rd that the front had suggested to the president that he should quickly order the implementation of the 1945 Constitution. Zodi said that the front had decided not to participate in the Constituent Assembly unless a meeting was convened to dissolve itself. He believes that by now, more than half of the members of the Constituent Assembly will not attend the meetings of the Constituent Assembly. This front is composed of seventeen parliamentary groups and has twenty members of parliament.

The "Social Messenger" of the Islamic Teachers Association changed its tune today. The newspaper published an editorial saying, "The people are waiting for President Sukarno's decision." But the newspaper hopes that President Sukarno will solve the problem extensively. The Islamic Teachers Association has always insisted on amending the 1945 Constitution in the past.

According to some newspapers here, the Masyumi Party, which has always opposed President Sukarno and the measures of the Indonesian government, is now actively trying to get the Constituent Assembly to reconvene. The Masyumi Party is also trying to get Sukarno to meet with it in order to postpone the restoration of the 1945 Constitution. Or, at least, it can obtain some political benefits for itself.

    就恢复1945年宪法问题
    苏加诺表示即将采取行动
    新华社雅加达4日电　苏加诺总统今天继续同负责的军政官员举行会议。参加会议的有朱安达总理、陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安中将、民族委员会副主席阿卜杜加尼、国务部长亚明、最高法院院长维约诺。
    关于会议中讨论的问题，没有宣布。
    情报部今天通知记者们说，苏加诺总统将在明天下午宣布他的重要决定。
    苏加诺总统3日曾经通知内阁会议，他将在短时间内就恢复1945年宪法一事采取行动。苏加诺总统当天同内阁举行了近一小时的会谈。情报部长苏迪比约在会谈后说，苏加诺总统决定在短时间内对恢复1945年宪法一事采取明确的措施。
    印度尼西亚国民党发表声明，再次要求苏加诺总统颁布法令来恢复1945年宪法。声明并且命令制宪议会中的国民党议员不要参加制宪议会可能召开的任何会议。这是国民党为了要求解散制宪议会所采取的又一项措施。
    这项声明是印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约在昨天召开军政领袖会议以前在茂物交给苏加诺总统的。
    维护1945年独立宣言阵线发言人佐迪·龚多古苏莫3日晚上在这个阵线举行的会议结束后说，这个阵线已经向总统建议，他应当赶快下令宣布实施1945年宪法。佐迪说，这个阵线已经决定不参加制宪议会，除非召开会议是为了解散它本身。他认为，到现在为止，制宪议会的议员有一半以上将不出席制宪议会会议。这个阵线是由十七个议会集团组成的，有二十名议员。
    伊斯兰教师联合会的“社会使者报”今天改变了论调。这家报纸发表社论说，“人民正在等待苏加诺总统的决定。”但是这家报纸希望苏加诺总统广泛地解决问题。伊斯兰教师联合会过去一直坚持要修改1945年宪法。
    据这里的一些报纸透露，一直反对苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚政府的措施的马斯友美党，现在积极活动企图使得制宪议会复会。马斯友美党还在设法使苏加诺同它会谈，以便推迟恢复1945年宪法。或者，至少可以为它本身获得某种政治利益。
