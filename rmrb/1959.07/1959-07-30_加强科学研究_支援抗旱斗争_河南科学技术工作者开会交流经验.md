    Strengthen Scientific Research, Support the Fight Against Drought
    Henan Scientific and Technical Workers Hold Meeting to Exchange Experiences
    According to Henan Daily news, in order to further support the fight against drought and protect seedlings, and solve problems such as tool reform, water conservation, irrigation technology, and improving watering efficiency, the Henan Provincial Science and Technology Commission held a symposium on July 24. The meeting requested that all relevant units strengthen cooperation, actively provide drought resistance experience and methods, specifically study and solve technical problems in drought resistance, give play to the role of scientific and technological work, and make contributions to winning a bumper autumn harvest.
    In the past, scientific and technical workers in Henan Province have already made considerable achievements in the fight against drought and seedling protection. For example, the Water Conservancy Science Research Institute has established fifty key points, and the Agricultural Science Research Institute has also established thirteen key points, in order to promptly grasp the drought situation and provide reference for leadership. At the same time, all units held symposiums and telephone conferences in key counties to deploy drought resistance work. The Agricultural Science Research Institute also held symposiums with veteran farmers to collect drought resistance experience. The Provincial People's Committee Tool Reform Office has compiled several simple and efficient light-weight water lifting tools, which will soon be printed and distributed for local imitation. The Meteorological Science Research Institute has also made considerable efforts in doing a good job of weather forecasting.
    At the meeting, everyone further exchanged and studied the experiences of fighting drought and protecting seedlings. Regarding the issue of irrigation technology, Engineer Wang Shiying of the Water Conservancy Science Research Institute said: Making full use of all water sources and giving full play to the maximum benefits of water conservancy projects is the most important issue at present. Self-flowing springs can be dug in eastern and western Henan. In areas with channel irrigation or river water diversion, temporary field structures can be built in the fields with mud and grass to meet current urgent needs. It is also necessary to rationally organize labor and irrigate day and night in shifts. In terms of methods, using alternate furrow and double furrow irrigation can reduce water consumption, expand the area of drought-resistant irrigation, and improve irrigation efficiency. Comrade Li Qian of the Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute said when talking about drought resistance experience: First of all, we must pay attention to cultivating and earthing up the soil to prevent drought and preserve moisture. According to past experience, rice fields that are cultivated four times yield 10% more than those cultivated once. He also proposed a method of foliar spraying, saying that according to experiments by the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, when rice is dry during the heading stage, spraying water will cause heading to occur three to four days earlier and increase the seed setting rate by 12% compared to not spraying. Regarding the vigorous planting of late crops, he said: According to the results of discussions with veteran farmers, millet planted around the beginning of autumn in the past still yielded more than 100 kilograms per mu.
    At the meeting, everyone also emphasized that crops that have withered due to drought should not be easily destroyed. According to a report from Chenliu County (merged into Kaifeng County), the soil moisture content of a wheat stubble corn and sorghum field was 10.9% and 7.8% respectively, the leaves were withered and yellow, one or two had died, and the aerial roots and main roots were dry and broken. However, new roots grew again 24 hours after watering. Comrade Miao Yongyan of the Meteorological Science Research Institute said: The weather this year is relatively abnormal, the high-pressure position is southward, the temperature is high, and evaporation is high. It is still uncertain whether there will be rainfall recently. Therefore, we must prevent drought when there is no drought, and fight drought when there is drought, and overcome the idea of relying on heaven and waiting for rain.
    This meeting was presided over by Chen Jifang, Deputy Director of the Office of the Provincial Science and Technology Commission. He hoped that in the future, all units would exchange information, strengthen contacts, and exchange materials, so that research results and experience could play a greater role.

    加强科学研究　支援抗旱斗争
    河南科学技术工作者开会交流经验
    据河南日报消息　为了进一步支援抗旱保苗斗争，解决工具改革、节约用水、灌溉技术、提高浇水效率等问题，河南省科学技术委员会于7月24日召开座谈会。会议要求各有关单位，加强协作，积极提供抗旱经验和办法，具体研究解决抗旱中的技术问题，发挥科学技术工作的作用，为夺取秋季大丰收作出贡献。
    过去，河南省的科学技术工作者，在抗旱保苗斗争中，已经作了不少成绩。如水利科学研究所已建立五十个重点，农业科学研究所也建立了十三个重点，以便及时掌握干旱情况，供给领导参考。同时，各单位都召开了重点县座谈会和电话会，布置抗旱工作。农业科学研究所还召开了老农座谈会，搜集抗旱经验。农业厅也派出了大批干部，组成工作组，分赴各地检查，掌握抗旱情况。省人委工具改革办公室已整理出几种制造简单、工效较高的轻便提水工具，即将印发供各地仿造。气象科学研究所，在作好天气预报工作方面，也作了不少努力。
    会上，大家又进一步交流和研究了抗旱保苗斗争的经验。关于灌水技术问题，水利科学研究所王士英工程师说：充分利用一切水源，发挥水利工程的最大效益，是目前最重要的问题。豫东、豫西地区可挖自流泉。渠灌或引用河水地区，在田间可用泥和草建筑临时田间建筑物，满足当前急需。并要合理组织劳力，日夜轮浇。在方法上，采用隔沟和开双沟浇水，能够减少用水量，扩大抗旱浇水面积，也能提高浇水效率。省农业科学研究所李浅同志在谈到抗旱经验时说：首先，要注意中耕培土，防旱保墒。根据过去经验，水稻地中耕四次的较中耕一次的增产10％。他还提出根外喷水的办法，说根据华东农业科学研究所的试验，水稻在抽穗时干旱的情况下，喷水的较不喷水的，抽穗要提早三至四天，结实率增加12％。关于大力播种晚作物问题，他说：根据与老农座谈结果，过去在立秋前后播种的谷子，每亩仍收到一百多斤。
    会上，大家还强调：对待因干旱而发生枯萎的作物，不能轻易毁去。据陈留县（已合并开封县）报告、一块麦茬玉米和高粱地，土壤含水量分别为10.9％和7.8％，叶片枯黄，已死亡一至二个，气根及主根均干死断掉。但浇水后二十四小时，即又生出新根。气象科学研究所苗永炎同志说：今年天气比较反常，高气压位置偏南，气温高，蒸发大。最近是否降雨仍无把握。因此，必须无旱要防旱，有旱要抗旱，克服靠天等雨思想。
    这个会议，由省科学技术委员会办公室副主任陈济方主持。他希望今后各单位要互通情报，加强联系，交流资料，使研究成果和经验发挥更大的作用。
