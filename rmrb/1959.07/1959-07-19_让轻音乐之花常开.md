    Let the Flower of Light Music Bloom Forever
    Qi Zhuang
    People need to work, and they also need to rest. Tightness and relaxation, tension and release, this is the natural rhythm of life. Musical art also needs to adapt to this rhythm. The masses need music that inspires fighting spirit and encourages enthusiasm, and they also need music that makes them feel relaxed and happy.
    When you need to take a good rest after work, you turn on the radio and tune it to the first program of the Central People's Broadcasting Station at 6:15 in the afternoon. You will hear a clear, melodious, light, and pleasant sound of music flowing out, and the fatigue on your body seems to disappear suddenly, and your spirit is refreshed. It's like walking in the hot sun at noon in midsummer, suddenly encountering a lush green yellow fruit tree, walking into the shade of the tree, and a cool breeze blows, instantly forgetting the hardship of trekking in the hot summer. Or, it's like viewing the landscape paintings of Bada Shanren, reading the landscape poems of Wang Wei and Meng Haoran. On Saturday or Sunday evenings, when a young man walks into a park and hears cheerful dance music, can he resist the urge to dance? Even if older people don't want to dance, who doesn't like listening to warbling voices or music like the sound of a clear spring in a secluded valley?
    Some people dislike light music because of a misunderstanding: equating light music with yellow music. In fact, light music is the most popular genre in musical art. Dunaevsky, the composer of "March of the Motherland," is a master in this field. In fact, we have a tradition of light music, but later the reputation of light music was ruined by yellow music. The yellow music of the old society was also light music, but it was a kind of light music that was emotionally decadent, contained poison, and could corrode people's minds. Of course, we must wage a fierce struggle against it. But this is by no means against light music. On the contrary, we must create more light music, especially dance music, with beautiful melodies and healthy emotions to replace the yellow music of the past. This is two sides of the same coin, and the two are not contradictory. We must not confuse light music with yellow music now.
    In the past year, there have been more light music works with national melodies and healthy emotions. Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou have better professional light music teams. Professional composers, singers, and performers also occasionally participate in light music activities, and the music industry has also begun to pay attention to this issue.
    Recently, the Chinese Musicians Association held a light music evening party with singers participating, performing more than thirty newly created and adapted, as well as excellent foreign light music works. Except for a few pieces written by professional composers, the rest were amateur creations by light music workers in Beijing. There are many good things that can be promoted. Later, the Music Association held a symposium. These activities are beneficial to promoting the flourishing of this flower of light music.
    Through this evening party and symposium, it is reflected that there are still many problems in the current light music activities, but the most important thing is: the lack of works with beautiful and clear melodies, light and pleasant emotions, healthy content, and light music characteristics. Light music creation has not yet attracted the general attention of composers. At the symposium, light music workers in Beijing unanimously called for the support of the music industry, and urgently hoped that professional composers would create more popular and easy-to-understand light music works (especially dance music). We can understand: behind this call are the broad masses who need light music to enrich their lives.

    让轻音乐之花常开
    其庄
    人们需要劳动，也需要休息。一紧一松一张一弛，这原是生活的规律。音乐艺术也是需要适应这个规律的。群众需要激励斗志、鼓舞干劲的音乐，也需要使人心旷神怡、情绪舒畅的音乐。
    当工作之余，需要好好休息一下，打开了收音机，对准中央人民广播电台下午六点一刻的第一种节目，就会听到一阵阵清越悠扬、轻松愉快的音乐声流出，身上的疲乏似乎倏然而逝，精神为之一爽。仿佛盛夏中午行路于炎热的阳光下，突然遇到一棵翠绿欲滴的黄果树，走进树荫一阵凉风袭来，顿忘炎夏跋涉之苦。或者，就如观八大山人的山水画，读王维、孟浩然的写景诗。星期六或星期天的晚上，当一个年轻人走进公园，听到轻快的跳舞音乐，能不产生也要去跳一番的欲望吗？上了年纪的人即使不想跳舞，但是听听莺啭歌喉或者幽谷鸣泉般的乐曲，谁又不喜欢呢？
    有人厌恶轻音乐是由于一种误解：把轻音乐和黄色音乐等同了起来。其实轻音乐是音乐艺术中群众性最大的一种体裁。“祖国进行曲”的作曲者杜那耶夫斯基就是这方面的大师。其实我们是有轻音乐的传统的，只是后来被黄色音乐败坏了轻音乐的名声。旧社会的黄色音乐也是轻音乐，但是那是一种情绪颓废、含有毒汁、能腐蚀人们心灵的轻音乐。我们当然要对它进行激烈的斗争。但是这决不是反对轻音乐，正相反，我们要多多创作旋律优美、情绪健康的轻音乐特别是跳舞音乐以代替过去的黄色音乐。这是一件事的两面，两者并不矛盾的。现在不容我们把轻音乐和黄色音乐混为一谈。
    最近一年来，具有民族音调、情绪健康的轻音乐作品多起来了，北京、上海、广州有了较好的专业轻音乐队，专业作曲家、歌唱家和演奏也偶尔参加轻音乐的活动，音乐界也开始注意这方面的问题了。
    最近中国音乐家协会举办了一次有歌唱家参加的轻音乐晚会，演出了三十几支新创作和改编，以及外国的优秀的轻音乐作品，除少数几支是专业作曲家写的，其余都是北京轻音乐工作者的业余创作。其中有不少可以推广的好东西。后来音协又召开了座谈会。这些活动，对促进轻音乐这朵鲜花的茂盛，是有好处的。
    通过了这次的晚会和座谈，反映出目前的轻音乐活动还存在着许多问题，但最主要的是：缺乏旋律优美明朗、情绪轻松愉快、内容健康并具有轻音乐特点的作品。轻音乐创作还未引起作曲家普遍的注意。在座谈会上北京的轻音乐工作者一致呼吁音乐界的支持，迫切希望专业作曲家多多创作一些通俗易解的轻音乐作品（特别是跳舞乐曲）。我们可以理解：这一呼吁的背后有着需要轻音乐来丰富生活的广大群众。
