Lush Grass and Dense Leaves: Quickly Accumulate Green Manure
Anhui Prepares Large Amounts of Fertilizer for Summer-Planted and Late Autumn Crops

Hefei, July 30th (This Newspaper) – Anhui Province, capitalizing on the characteristics of abundant summer vegetation, is seizing the season to intensively compost green manure in the summer fertilizer accumulation campaign. Since June, the province has accumulated over a billion dan of various green manures, preparing a large amount of fertilizer for summer-planted and late autumn crops.

From the mountainous areas of southern Anhui to the hilly areas of the Jianghuai region, there are abundant sources of green manure. Many lakes and ditches also contain large amounts of aquatic plants and lake indigo. These rich natural resources provide extremely favorable conditions for mass composting of green manure throughout the province. People's communes everywhere are seizing the favorable summer opportunity to compost green manure on fields and alongside roads. For example, Chaoxian County is utilizing its proximity to Chaohu Lake to locally source and compost various green manures. The eleven people's communes along Chaohu Lake are currently actively harvesting lake indigo, with each commune having specially organized professional teams for this purpose. In June alone, over 17 million dan of lake indigo were harvested. Wuhu, Anqing, Lu'an and other special districts are currently organizing large numbers of laborers to cut wild plants and harvest aquatic weeds for composting green manure. As of July 8th, Langxi and Nanling counties in the Wuhu Special District had dug over 30,000 field-side fertilizer pits and composted over 2 million dan of green manure, enough for 50,000 mu of double-season late rice as base fertilizer.

In the vigorous composting of green manure, Anhui Province is paying attention to saving labor in various ways and integrating fertilizer accumulation with other tasks. Quanjiao County's Gushan Commune combines the addition of water plants to field-side fertilizer pits for composting green manure with topdressing, irrigation, and pest and disease control. Their method involves adding insecticidal wild plants such as smartweed, artemisia, and cat's eye to the green manure, and then irrigating the fields with the fertilized water from the ditches. This not only composts green manure but also achieves pest control, and saves a large amount of labor due to the self-flowing irrigation of fertilized water. The Nanchong Production Team of Machi Commune in Guichi County cuts green sod from fields and puts it in heaps on the field ridges, then scrapes up the turf from the field ridges and seals it on top, using mud to seal the outside, and making a one-inch hole at the top to allow rainwater to seep into the pile to promote fermentation, making it ready for application in about ten days. This method of accumulating green manure saves a lot of labor, eliminates pests on the field ridges, and has good fertilizer efficiency.

In addition to vigorously composting green manure, Anhui Province is also taking various measures to accumulate various types of farmyard manure. From early February to mid-July, the province has accumulated over 10.9 billion dan of farmyard manure. In the fertilizer accumulation campaign, all localities have rationally arranged labor, established fertilizer accumulation leadership organizations, and established specialized fertilizer accumulation teams. Reasonable remuneration is given according to the quantity and quality of accumulated fertilizer, which greatly encourages the enthusiasm of commune members for fertilizer accumulation and powerfully promotes the development of the fertilizer accumulation campaign.

Hefei, July 30th (This Newspaper) – The Sanlidian Brigade of the Shuangqiao Commune in Xuancheng County, Anhui Province, according to the fertilizer needs of various crops at different growth stages, adopts the methods of determining fertilizer by field, accumulating fertilizer according to needs, and applying fertilizer according to seedlings, and implements planned fertilizer accumulation and application.

In order to achieve planned fertilizer accumulation and application, the Sanlidian Brigade's Party General Branch has made comprehensive arrangements for the different topdressing and base fertilizer needs of various crops in each season since the beginning of spring. They convened veteran farmers for discussions, analyzed the soil quality of each plot of land and the growth characteristics of various crops, and specifically determined what fertilizer was needed for a certain crop at what time, and what fertilizer was suitable for a certain soil type, so as to achieve fertilizer application based on the field and fertilizer application based on needs.

After the fertilizer application plan was arranged, the Brigade's Party General Branch strengthened the leadership of fertilizer accumulation. First, it mobilized commune members to make full use of natural conditions to cut artemisia and compost green manure. The entire brigade dug 742 field-side fertilizer pits and over 1,400 composting pits. And adopted methods such as cleaning pig and cattle pens, exchanging household soil for wild soil, digging dark ditches, accumulating miscellaneous fertilizer, and burning soil manure to accumulate fertilizer. They also universally engaged in ammonia extraction from smoke and produced soil fertilizer on a large scale. Of the brigade's 46 canteens, 37 were engaged in ammonia extraction from smoke. The soil fertilizer plants also developed from three to 36, producing more than 800 dan of soil fertilizer per day. At the same time, the brigade's cadres took the lead in accumulating fertilizer and, like the commune members, were allocated fertilizer accumulation quotas.

After adopting the above measures, from the beginning of March to the end of June, the Sanlidian Brigade overfulfilled the fertilizer accumulation plan.

In order to achieve planned fertilizer application, they distributed fertilizer according to the needs of the crops. For example, after the brigade discovered that more than 400 mu of wheat had third-class seedlings, they promptly topdressed more than 33,000 dan of human and animal manure, soil fertilizer, and composted fertilizer and other quick-acting fertilizers. Because sufficient base fertilizer for early and mid-season rice was prepared in advance, early and mid-season rice transplanting could be completed on time.

After implementing the measures of planned fertilizer accumulation and application, the brigade can also rationally use strong and weak labor according to the busy and slack times of agricultural work. For example, when agricultural work is relatively slack, they organize labor to transport fertilizer to the fields; when topdressing is needed, they only need to organize some semi-labor to apply the fertilizer to the fields in a timely manner, so as not to affect other agricultural work due to crash fertilizer application.

    草青叶密　快积绿肥
    安徽已为夏种作物和晚秋作物准备大量肥料
    本报合肥30日电　安徽省各地根据夏季草木繁茂的特点，在夏季积肥运动中，正抓紧季节突击沤制绿肥。从6月份以来，全省已积各种绿肥十多亿担，为夏种作物和晚秋作物准备了大量肥料。
    安徽省从皖南山区到江淮丘陵地区，到处都有充足的绿肥肥源。在很多湖泊和沟塘里，也有大量的水草和湖靛。这些丰富的自然资源，为全省各地大量沤制绿肥提供了极其有利的条件。各地人民公社正抓住夏季有利时机，就田头地边，大沤绿肥。例如巢县就利用靠近巢湖的特点，就地取材，沤制各种绿肥。沿巢湖的十一个人民公社最近正大捞湖靛，各个公社都专门组织了捞湖靛专业队，在6月份内打捞的湖靛就有一千七百多万担。芜湖、安庆、六安等专区目前正组织大批劳力砍野生植物和打捞水草，沤制绿肥。芜湖专区的郎溪和南陵两县到7月8日止，就挖了三万多个田头肥窖，已沤绿肥二百多万担，足够五万亩双季晚稻做基肥用。
    在大力沤制绿肥中，安徽省各地从多方面注意节省劳力，并使积肥与其他各种工作结合起来。全椒县孤山公社在田头肥窖里放水草沤制绿肥，还使沤肥与追肥、灌溉和除治病虫害相结合。他们的办法是在沤青草肥时，掺放一些红蓼草、蒿子和猫儿眼等有杀虫效能的野草，把沤制绿肥的肥水就沟壑灌到田里。这样既沤制了绿肥，又收到杀虫的效果，并因肥水自流施灌而节省出大量劳力。贵池县马池公社南冲生产队，把田头地尾的青槎砍下、在田埂上堆成堆子，再把田埂上的草皮铲起来封在上面，外面用泥巴包封起来，顶开做一个一寸左右的洞、使雨水能掺入堆中，促使发酵，十来天即可施用。这样堆积绿肥节省了很多劳力，消灭了田埂上的虫害，肥效也好。
    安徽省各地除大力沤制绿肥外，还采取各种措施积攒多种农家肥料，从2月初到7月中旬，全省已积农家肥料一百零九亿多担。各地在积肥运动中，都合理安排了劳动力，成立了积肥领导组织，建立了积肥专业队，按积聚肥料的数量和质量，给予合理的报酬，因而大大地鼓舞了社员积肥的积极性，有力地推动了积肥运动的开展。（冯武生）
    本报合肥30日电　安徽省宣城县双桥公社三里店大队，按照各种农作物不同生长期对肥料的需要，采取按田定肥、按需积肥、按苗施肥，实行积肥、用肥计划化。
    为了做到计划积肥用肥，三里店大队党总支从入春以来，就根据各个季节把各种作物所需要的不同追肥和基肥都作了全面安排。他们召集了老农座谈，分析各片土地的土质，各种作物生长的特点，具体确定了某种作物在什么时候需要什么肥料，某种土质宜下什么肥料，做到看田施肥，按需下肥。
    用肥计划安排好后，大队党总支便加强积肥的领导。首先发动社员充分利用自然条件，砍青蒿，沤制绿肥。全大队挖有田头肥窖七百四十二个，沤肥坑一千四百多个。并且采取清理猪牛栏、家土换野土、挖阴沟、积杂肥、烧土粪等办法积肥。还普遍大搞烟中取氨，大制土化肥。全大队四十六个食堂，有三十七个食堂都进行烟中取氨。土化肥厂也由三个发展到三十六个，每天可产土化肥八百多担。与此同时，大队的干部都带头积肥，和社员一样分配积肥定额。
    采取以上各种措施以后，从3月初到6月底止，三里店大队已超额完成了积肥计划。
    为了做到计划用肥，他们把肥料按照作物的需要进行了分配。如该大队发现有四百多亩小麦三类苗后，便及时地追上了三万三千多担人畜粪、土化肥、沤肥等速效肥料。由于事前备足了早、中稻基肥，因而能按时完成早、中稻栽插。
    这个大队在实行了计划积肥用肥的措施后，还可以依据农活忙闲、合理使用强弱劳力。如农活比较闲时，他们组织劳力把肥料运往田头；需要追肥时，只要组织一些半劳力就可以把肥料及时地施下田，不致因突击施肥而影响其他农活。
