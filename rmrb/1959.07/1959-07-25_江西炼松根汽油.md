Jiangxi Refines Gasoline from Pine Roots

Nanchang, July 24 (This newspaper dispatch) – Jiangxi Province is utilizing pine roots left over after logging to refine oil, and the gasoline extracted is usable in cars and tractors.

In the latter half of last year, the Damaoshan Reclamation Farm first conducted experiments in refining oil from pine roots. Since the beginning of March this year, more than 200 dry distillation furnaces have been established throughout the province, producing more than 400 tons of crude oil. The gasoline refined from pine root crude oil in Longnan County has already been used in long-distance buses traveling from Longnan to Ganxian and other places. In Anyuan County, pine root diesel is being used to power tractors for plowing, with good results.

Jiangxi Province has abundant pine trees. Using pine roots to refine oil can generally yield 30 jin of pine root crude oil from every 100 jin of pine roots, and every 100 jin of pine root crude oil can currently be refined into 8 to 10 jin of gasoline. The dry distillation furnace equipment is simple. Generally, only a steel plate or a large iron pot is used as the furnace bottom, bricks are used to build the furnace body, and a small amount of galvanized iron or bamboo pipes are used to make the oil pipes. The method of refining gasoline from crude oil is also not complicated, and is basically the same as the method of refining gasoline in synthetic petroleum plants. (Wang Yi)

    江西炼松根汽油
    本报南昌24日电　江西省利用采伐后的松树根炼油，提炼出的汽油能在汽车、拖拉机上使用。
    去年下半年，大茅山垦殖场首先进行了松根炼油的试验。今年3月初以来，全省建立了二百多个干馏炉，炼出原油四百多吨。龙南县从松根原油中提炼的汽油，已经用到从龙南到赣县等地的长途汽车上，安远县用松根柴油开动拖拉机耕地，效果良好。
  江西省境内松树很多。用松根炼油，每一百斤松树根一般可以出三十斤松根原油，而每一百斤松根原油目前能提炼八到十斤汽油。干馏炉设备简单，一般只用一块钢板或大铁锅做炉底，用砖块砌炉体，再用少量白铁皮或是竹管子做出油管。从原油提炼汽油的办法也不复杂，和人造石油厂提炼汽油的办法基本相同。　（王毅）
