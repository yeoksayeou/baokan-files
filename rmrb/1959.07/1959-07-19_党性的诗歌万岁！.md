    Long Live Poetry with Party Spirit!
    Shan Bo
    Today (July 19th) is Mayakovsky's birthday. If the poet were still alive today, he wouldn't be too old, sixty-six years old. Good art is immortal, but excellent works that are closer to us in time always play a greater role in our lives. Moreover, Mayakovsky can be said to be our contemporary, and aren't his famous poems works of "modern themes" written by an outstanding contemporary writer?
    Not long ago, a bronze statue of the poet was erected in front of the "Beijing Hotel" in Moscow, with his head held high and his eyes gazing, as if he were reciting his new work. Cars flowed like water on the street, and pedestrians were like a tide. The poet seemed to still live and struggle among his compatriots.
    Not long ago, on our Central People's Broadcasting Station, we heard artists reciting poetry, including Mayakovsky's famous poems such as "Soviet Passport" and "Good!". It was as if the poet's expression of pride in his country was the same as our pride in our country, as if the poet's satire and criticism of the imperialists were the same as our satire and criticism of them.
    As the years go by, Mayakovsky's trumpet-like voice has become louder and louder. He represents more and more people, speaking to all mankind on the world stage. In the more than forty years since the outbreak of the great October Socialist Revolution, more working people in the world have awakened, and many socialist countries have been born and grown. This "most outstanding and talented poet of the Soviet era" is also known and loved by more and more people, and the vitality of his poetry is becoming more vigorous with the progress of time.
    The poet's love for the socialist motherland, his infinite loyalty to the proletariat, his respect and trust for revolutionary teachers and the revolutionary masses, and his deep concern and dedication to the revolutionary cause are all fully expressed in his works. These passionate revolutionary odes are the earliest immortal masterpieces of socialist literature.
    Loving the Party, loving the class, and also hating the class enemies and the remnants of capitalism in the ideology of one's own people. This is another aspect of the ideological content of Mayakovsky's works. He expressed this feeling with the following words:
    I want to, like a wolf,
      bite to pieces
        bureaucracy.
    His strong hatred is unified with his equally strong love. This is complete communist Party spirit. The great Russian poet Nekrasov said: "He who lives without sorrow and anger does not love his motherland." It is precisely because of the love for the positive and new things that anger arises against the negative and decadent old things. It is impossible to imagine a new morality that pleases both sides—no, this is "old morality," liberalism, philistinism.
    Mayakovsky's "whip-like language" was welcomed by the masses. The poem "Meeting Mania" was even praised by Lenin. Lenin's remarks at the Communist Party Group meeting of the All-Russian Metalworkers Congress on March 6, 1922 (one day after the poet's poem was published) have been quoted many times, but I would like to quote them below, and quote them even more:
    "Yesterday I happened to read a political poem by Mayakovsky in 'Izvestia'. I am not an admirer of his poetic talent, although I fully admit that I am an amateur in this field. But from a political and administrative point of view, I have not felt so happy for a long time. In this poem, he sarcastically ridiculed meetings and mocked communists who are always holding meetings and constantly holding meetings. I don't know how the poem is written, but in politics, I dare to guarantee that it is completely correct. We are indeed in a state of endlessly holding meetings, establishing committees, and formulating plans. It should be pointed out that this is a very bad state. There was such a typical figure in Russian life, and that is Oblomov. He was always lying in bed, making plans. A long time has passed since then. Russia has experienced three revolutions, but there are still many Oblomovs, because Oblomov is not only a landlord, but also a peasant, not only a peasant, but also an intellectual, not only an intellectual, but also a worker and a communist. We only need to look at how we hold meetings and how we work in various committees, and we can say that old Oblomov still exists, so we must wash and clean him for a long time, and urge and whip him, before some results can be produced. On this point, we should see our situation clearly and not have any illusions. We should not imitate those who write the word "revolution" in capital letters, like the Socialist-Revolutionaries. We should repeat Marx's words: In revolutionary times, not only will fewer stupid things not be done, but sometimes more will be done. We must look at these stupid things calmly and boldly, and we revolutionaries must learn this." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 33, pages 194-195, People's Publishing House)
    From the quotation, it can be seen that the great Lenin admired Mayakovsky's poem because of his sincere concern for the revolutionary cause and the interests of the people. He could not tolerate any damage to the revolutionary cause. Everything is for the Party, starting from the interests of the Party. The interests of the Party are also the interests of the people. Fighting, singing and praising, criticizing and satirizing for the interests of the Party and the revolutionary cause are equally necessary weapons.

### 党性的诗歌万岁！

    党性的诗歌万岁！
    山柏
    今天（7月19日）是马雅可夫斯基的诞生日。如果诗人能活到现在的话，年纪也不算太大，六十六岁。好的艺术是永生的，但时间上距离我们更近的优秀作品，对我们生活所起的作用，总要更大些。何况马雅可夫斯基，可以说是我们的同时代人，他的那些著名的诗篇，难道不是一位当代杰出的作家所写的“现代题材”的作品吗？
    不久以前，在莫斯科“北京饭店”前面，树立了一座诗人的铜像，昂首凝眸，仿佛正在朗诵他的新作。街上车如流水，行人如潮，诗人似乎依旧生活在、斗争在他的同胞们之间。
    不久以前，在我们的中央广播电台里，听到了艺术家们的诗朗诵，其中有“苏联护照”、“好！”等马雅可夫斯基的名篇。仿佛诗人所表达的他对自己国家的自豪感也就是我们对自己国家的自豪感一样，仿佛诗人对帝国主义者的讽刺和抨击也就是我们对它们的讽刺和抨击一样。
    随着年代的过去，马雅可夫斯基的号角一样的声音，越来越响亮了，他代表着越来越多的人民，在世界的讲台上，向全人类发言。从伟大的十月社会主义革命爆发后的四十多个年头中，世界上更多的劳动人民觉醒起来了，许多社会主义国家诞生、成长起来了。这位“苏维埃时代最优秀、最有才华的诗人”，也为更多的人们所认识和敬爱，他的诗的生命力随着时间的前进而更加蓬勃旺盛。
    诗人对社会主义祖国的爱、对无产阶级的无限忠诚、对革命导师和革命群众的崇敬和信赖、对革命事业的深切关怀和献身精神，这一切都十分饱满地表现在他的作品中，这些热烈的革命的颂歌，是社会主义文学的最初的不朽的巨著。
    爱党、爱阶级，同时也恨阶级的敌人和自己人民思想意识中的资本主义残余。这是马雅可夫斯基作品的思想内容的另一个方面。他是用下面这样的字眼来表达这种感情的：
    我要像狼一般
      咬碎
        官僚主义。
    他的强烈的恨，是和他的同样强烈的爱统一的。这是完整的共产主义的党性。俄罗斯伟大诗人涅克拉索夫说过：“谁生活着没有悲伤和愤怒，他就不爱自己的祖国。”正是由于对正面的积极的新事物的热爱，才产生了对反面的腐朽的旧事物的愤怒。不能想像有一种两面讨好的新道德——不，这是“旧道德”，自由主义，市侩主义。
    马雅可夫斯基的“鞭子一样的语言”，受到了群众的欢迎。“开会迷”这首诗更受到了列宁的称赞。列宁在1922年3月6日（诗人的诗发表后的一天），在全俄五金工人代表大会共产党党团会议上的演说中的那段话已经多次地被引用了，但是我还想引用在下面，并且引用得更多一些：
    “昨天我偶然在‘消息报’上读了马雅可夫斯基的一首政治题材的诗。我不是他的诗才的崇拜者，虽然我完全承认自己在这方面外行。但是从政治和行政的观点来看，我很久没有感到这样愉快了。他在这首诗里尖刻地嘲笑了会议，讥讽了老是开会和不断开会的共产党员。诗写得怎样，我不知道，然而在政治方面，我敢担保这是完全正确的。我们确实处于永无止境地老是开会、成立委员会、制定计划的状态中，应当指出这是很糟的状态。在俄国生活中曾有过这样的典型，这就是奥勃洛摩夫。他老是躺在床上，制定计划。从那时起，已经过去很长一段时间了。俄国经历了三次革命，但仍然存在着许多奥勃洛摩夫，因为奥勃洛摩夫不仅是地主，而且是农民，不仅是农民，而且是知识分子，不仅是知识分子，而且是工人和共产党员。我们只要看一下我们如何开会，如何在各个委员会里工作，就可以说老奥勃洛摩夫仍然存在，所以必须长期地洗刷清扫他，督促鞭策他，才会产生一些效果。在这一点上，我们应当看清自己的处境，不要抱任何幻想。我们不要模仿那些把“革命”这个名词写成大写的人，像社会革命党人那样。我们应该重复马克思的话：在革命时期不但不会少作蠢事，有时还会多。我们必须冷静地和大胆地来看这些蠢事，我们革命者必须学会这一点。”（列宁全集第三十三卷194页—195页，人民出版社）
    从引文看得出，伟大的列宁之所以欣赏马雅可夫斯基的那首诗，是由于他对革命事业、人民利益的赤忱的关怀，他不能容忍任何对革命事业的损害。一切为了党，从党的利益出发。党的利益也就是人民的利益，为了党的利益、革命的事业而战斗，歌颂和赞美，批评和讽刺，是同样需要的武器。
