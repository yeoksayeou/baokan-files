　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 25th: Vientiane dispatch: The Lao Royal Government is blatantly violating the Geneva Accords by requesting U.S. military experts to strengthen the Lao army with U.S. weapons and equipment.

　　According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio on the 24th, the Lao government recently signed a joint communiqué with France regarding French assistance in training the Lao army. The communiqué revealed that the training and strengthening of the Lao army would use "various weapons and military materials provided by the U.S. to Laos," instead of the weapons commonly used by the French army.

　　The communiqué stated that, for this reason, the Lao government not only requested assistance from the French government but also "decided to request assistance from U.S. military experts."

　　The joint communiqué also stated that "the (Lao government's) aim is to have a strong army in Laos," and that U.S. military experts and French trainers will work on this "urgent task" of building the Lao army within six months to a year.

　　The final declaration of the Geneva Conference and the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Laos both prohibit foreign military personnel and weapons from entering Laos. This joint communiqué between the Lao government and the French government is a blatant violation of these international agreements.

    老挝政府公开破坏日内瓦协议
    竟要求美国帮助加强军队
    新华社河内25日电　万象消息：老挝王国政府明目张胆地违反日内瓦协议，要求美国军事专家用美国武器和装备来加强老挝军队。
    据万象电台24日广播，老挝政府最近和法国签订了一项关于法国帮助训练老挝军队的联合公报。公报透露的训练和加强老挝军队，将使用“美国援助老挝的各种武器和军用物资”，而不用法国军队普遍使用的武器。
    公报说，为此，老挝政府不仅要求法国政府给予帮助，并且“决定要求美国军事专家给予帮助”。
    这项联合公报还说，“（老挝政府的）目的在使老挝有一支强大的军队”，美国军事专家和法国训练人员都将为在半年到一年期间内建设老挝军队这个“紧急任务”而工作。
    日内瓦会议最后宣言和关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定都禁止外国军事人员和武器进入老挝。老挝政府和法国政府的这项联合公报是对这些国际协议的粗暴的破坏。
