Editor's Note: The great October Socialist Revolution opened a new historical chapter of equality, mutual respect, and friendship among the peoples of all countries. The day after the October Revolution, the Soviet government issued the famous "Decree on Peace," declaring all treaties signed by the Tsarist Russian government invalid. On July 25, 1919, the Soviet government issued a "Declaration to the Chinese People and the Governments of the North and South," stating that all privileges previously obtained by the Tsarist Russian government in China were abolished. This declaration fully embodies the great spirit of Leninism's national policy and is an important milestone in the history of Sino-Soviet friendship. Today is the 40th anniversary of the publication of this declaration, and we are publishing this article by Soviet historian Professor Ma·Kapiqia.

July 25th of this year marks the 40th anniversary of the publication of the Soviet government's "Declaration to the Chinese People and the Governments of the North and South." This document is an important milestone in the history of the development of friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples.

Shortly after its establishment, the Soviet government wanted to hold negotiations with the Chinese envoy in Petrograd regarding the establishment of friendly relations between the two countries. The Soviet government proposed to the Chinese government to begin negotiations on abolishing unequal treaties and returning to the Chinese people everything that the Tsarist government had plundered from the Chinese people, either by itself or together with other countries.

The feudal warlord government in Beijing ignored this proposal and recalled its envoy to Petrograd in March 1918.

In the summer of 1919, the Red Army defeated Kolchak's army and, after liberating the Urals, began to drive the White Guards and armed interventionists out of Siberia. At this time, the Soviet Russian government decided to issue another declaration proposing negotiations to China.

The declaration stated, "Soviet Russia and its Red Army, after two years of fighting and arduous efforts, marched east across the Urals, not for atrocities, enslavement, and plunder... We want to liberate all peoples from the oppression of foreign bayonets and money. Foreigners use bayonets and money to strangle the enslaved peoples of the East, especially the Chinese people. We not only assist our working class but also the Chinese people."

The declaration mentioned that the worker-peasant government had declared the abolition of all secret treaties signed by the former Tsarist government. The Tsarist government and its allies, by means of these secret treaties, seduced and enslaved the peoples of the East, especially the Chinese people.

The declaration stated, "The worker-peasant government abolishes all special rights and Russian commercial areas within China. No Russian officials, monks, or missionaries shall interfere in Chinese affairs. If they commit illegal acts, they shall be tried by local courts according to law. No other authority or court shall exist within China except the authority and courts of Chinese citizens."

The Soviet government expressed its willingness to have its plenipotentiary representative discuss all other issues with the Chinese people, to permanently eradicate all violence and illegal acts previously committed by the Russian government against China. The declaration concluded: "If the Chinese people are willing to obtain the same freedom as the Russian people and save China from the fate of a second Korea or a second India prepared for it by the Allied Powers in the Treaty of Versailles, then the Chinese people should understand that the Russian workers, peasants, and Red Army are their only allies and brothers in the struggle for freedom."

The Soviet government's "Declaration to the Chinese People and the Governments of the North and South" vividly reflected the new principles of international relations declared and implemented by the Soviet government.

At a time when imperialist powers were imposing a semi-colonial system on China and uniting to suppress any attempt to destroy this system, the Soviet government treated the Chinese people as equals, automatically proposed to return to the Chinese people without compensation what Tsarist Russia had seized from them, and extended a hand of friendship to the Chinese people.

The imperialist powers and the then Beijing government tried their best to conceal this statement of the Soviet government from the people. It was not until April 3, 1920, eight months later, that this statement was disclosed in the Chinese press.

The then Beijing government, colluding with the imperialist powers, did not intend to accept the Soviet government's proposal. Moreover, it believed that the Soviet government would not last long and therefore ignored the Soviet government's declaration. The southern government of China was then experiencing a serious crisis. After Sun Yat-sen left the government, the real power of the government fell into the hands of warlords.

The broad masses of the Chinese people warmly welcomed the Soviet government's declaration on the Soviet Russia's abandonment of unequal treaties. Chinese social organizations, including the National Federation of Journalists, the National Federation of Students, the National Federation of Chinese Business Circles for National Salvation, the Chinese Labor Union, the Chinese Industrial Association, and other groups, sent telegrams to the Soviet government, thanking it for its policy of equality and friendship toward the Chinese people, and declaring the firm determination of the Chinese people to strive for the establishment of friendly relations between China and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

The lofty principles described in the statement later became the basis for the Agreement on the Settlement of Sino-Soviet Issues of May 31, 1924 (referring to the "Outline Agreement on the Settlement of Sino-Russian Issues" - Editor). However, the Chinese warlords soon undermined this agreement. During the Kuomintang rule, the Chiang Kai-shek clique and its foreign patrons obstructed the development of Soviet-Chinese friendship.

After the overthrow of the Kuomintang reactionary rule and the expulsion of American imperialism from China, all obstacles to the development of Soviet-Chinese friendly relations were removed. The development of friendship and cooperation between the people of the two great countries of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China has unlimited and broad prospects.

The Soviet Union and People's China are united by the ideals of building socialist and communist societies and the principles of proletarian internationalism. They have established relations with each other based on the principles of complete equality, respect for territorial integrity and national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed on February 14, 1950, is the unshakable foundation of this cooperation. Soviet-Chinese friendship sets a clear and inspiring example for all countries and peoples and is an important guarantee for maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

    苏中友谊史上的重要里程碑
    苏联历史学博士  马·卡皮查教授
    编者按　伟大的十月社会主义革命，揭开了各国人民之间平等、相互尊重和友好的历史新页。在十月革命爆发后的第二天，苏维埃政府就颁布了著名的“和平法令”，宣布帝俄政府所签订的条约无效。1919年7月25日，苏维埃政府发表了“告中国人民及南北政府宣言”，声明凡是以前帝俄政府在中国所取得的特权一律废除。这个宣言充分体现了列宁主义民族政策的伟大精神，是中苏友谊史上的重要里程碑。今天是这个宣言发表的四十周年，我们特发表了苏联历史学博士马·卡皮查教授的这篇文章。
    今年7月25日是苏维埃政府“告中国人民及南北政府宣言”发表的四十周年。这个文件是苏中两国人民友谊发展史上的重要里程碑。
    苏维埃政府建立后不久，便想同中国驻彼得格勒的使节举行有关建立两国友好关系的谈判。苏维埃政府建议同中国政府开始谈判废除不平等条约，以及把沙皇政府自己或同其他国家一起从中国人民那里掠夺的一切东西归还中国人民的问题。
    北京的封建军阀政府却没有理睬这个建议，并且在1918年3月召回了驻彼得格勒的使节。
    1919年夏天，红军击败了高尔察克军队，并在解放了乌拉尔之后，开始把白卫军和武装干涉者驱逐出西伯利亚。这时，苏俄政府决定再一次发表宣言，向中国提出举行谈判的建议。
    宣言中指出，“苏俄及其红军，经两年奋战和艰苦卓绝的努力之后，越乌拉尔而东进，并非为了暴行、奴役和掠夺……我们要从外国的刺刀和金钱的压迫下解放各族人民。外国人用刺刀和金钱来绞杀被奴役的东方各国人民，而首先是中国人民。我们不仅援助我们的劳动阶级，并且援助中国人民。”
    宣言中提到，工农政府已宣布废除过去沙皇政府签订的一切秘密条约。沙皇政府和它的盟国一道，凭着这些秘密条约，诱迫兼施，奴役东方各族人民，尤其是中国人民。
    宣言中指出，“工农政府废除一切特别权利，及在中国境内的俄商贸易区。任何俄国官员、僧侣、传教士均不得干预中国事务，如有犯法行为，应依法受当地法庭审判。除中国国民之权力与法庭外，中国境内不容有其他之权力与法庭存在。”
    苏维埃政府表示准备由它的全权代表同中国人民商谈其他一切问题，永远地铲除从前俄国政府对中国采取的种种暴力和不法行为。宣言最后指出：“如果中国人民愿意取得俄国人民那样的自由，并使中国免遭协约国在凡尔赛条约中准备赐给的第二高丽或第二印度之命运，则请中国人民了解俄国工人、农民和红军是他们为自由而奋斗的唯一盟友和兄弟。”
    苏维埃政府的“告中国人民和南北政府宣言”，鲜明地反映了苏维埃政府宣布并执行的国际关系新原则。
    正当帝国主义列强以半殖民地制度强加在中国头上，并联合起来镇压任何企图摧毁这一制度的行动时，苏维埃政府对中国人民以平等相待，自动提议无偿地把沙皇俄国从中国人民那里夺取的东西归还给中国人民，向中国人民伸出了友谊之手。
    帝国主义列强和当时的北京政府，极力向人民隐瞒苏维埃政府的这一文告。经过八个月之后，在1920年4月3日，这份文告才在中国报刊披露。
    同帝国主义列强勾结的当时北京政府，不打算接受苏维埃政府的建议。而且，它认为苏维埃政府的寿命不会长，因而对苏维埃政府的宣言不加理会。中国的南方政府，当时正经历着严重的危机。在孙中山离开这个政府后，政府的实权落在军阀手里。
    广大的中国人民热烈地欢迎苏维埃政府关于苏维埃俄国放弃不平等条约的宣言。中国的社会团体，包括全国报界联合会、全国学生联合会、中华商界救国总团、中华劳动公会、中华实业协会等团体，拍电报给苏维埃政府，感谢它对中国人民的平等和友好的政策，宣称中国人民为争取中国同俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国建立友好关系而斗争的坚定决心。
    文告中所叙述的那些崇高原则，后来成了1924年5月31日关于调整苏中问题协定（按指“中俄解决悬案大纲协定”——编者）的基础。但是，中国军阀们很快就破坏了这个协定。在国民党统治时期，蒋介石集团及其外国庇护者阻挠了苏中友好的发展。
    国民党反动统治被推翻和美帝国主义被赶出中国后，发展苏中友好关系的一切障碍都被铲除了。苏联和中华人民共和国两个伟大国家的人民之间友好与合作的发展，有了无可限量的广阔前途。
    苏联和人民中国以建立社会主义和共产主义社会的理想和无产阶级国际主义原则团结在一起。它们根据完全平等、尊重领土完整和国家独立主权、互不干涉内政的原则建立了彼此间的关系。1950年2月14日签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约，是这一合作的不可动摇的基础。苏中友谊为一切国家和人民树立了鲜明的鼓舞人心的榜样，也是维护亚洲和世界和平的重要保障。
