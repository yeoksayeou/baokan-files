Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 13th: According to TASS, during the Athens military court's trial of Greek national hero Glezos on the 12th, the defendant's defense counsel used conclusive evidence to prove that the accusations against Glezos were based on fabrications by the Greek political police.

The police currently accuse Glezos based solely on the following facts: that Glezos met with Korygiannis, a representative of the so-called Greek Communist Party's "espionage organization," at the home of his sister, Vasiliki Dorianiou, and her husband on the night of August 16, 1958. This accusation is based on the so-called "confessions" made by the Dorianiou couple on November 12, 1958, stating that they had, at Glezos's request, received a stranger at their home who appeared to be Korygiannis, and that Glezos had later met with this person.

Papasspiropoulos and Sakellariou, the Greek police officers responsible for monitoring Glezos, admitted in court on the 11th and 12th, in response to questions from the defense counsel, that the police had not actually seen Glezos enter his sister's house.

The materials provided by the defendant's defense counsel during the trial of the Glezos case on the 12th showed that the Dorianiou couple's aforementioned "confessions" were fabricated and imposed on them by the Greek political police. Before the Dorianiou couple provided the aforementioned so-called "confessions" on November 12, 1958, the police had already asked them on October 29, 1958, to "prove" the same facts, but they denied at the time that the events mentioned in the November 12th "confessions" had ever occurred.

According to testimony from Mangakis, the Dorianiou couple's defense counsel, after presenting the first confession on October 29th, the Dorianiou couple were arrested and isolated by the political police without any basis, and were subjected to so-called "guidance." For two months, the residents of the street where they lived were also frequently interrogated. This defense counsel referred to a letter written by the Dorianiou couple to the military court, proving that the "confession" of November 12, 1958, was imposed on them by the police. The letter stated that only their first conversation on October 29, 1958, was consistent with the facts, while the confession about Glezos meeting with Korygiannis was extracted from them by the political police using "psychological pressure."

Dorianiou herself also confirmed this in court on the 12th. When answering the court president's question, "Do you stand by the views in this letter?" she replied: "Yes."

Glezos's defense counsels, Papasspirou, Vassilatos, Stephanakis, and the Dorianiou couple's defense counsel, Mangakis, said that since this was the case, it must be confirmed that the claim about Glezos meeting with Korygiannis was baseless. Mangakis also questioned on what basis the Greek political police isolated the Dorianiou couple, insisting on obtaining the required confession from them.

Mangakis pointed out that the accusation against Glezos was fabricated by the political police. The defendants' defense counsels also refuted the second accusation against Glezos, namely that he guaranteed Korygiannis a place to live, that is, he assisted espionage activities. The military judges in Athens attempted to use this accusation as an excuse to deal with Glezos under Law No. 375. However, after comparing various documents and facts, the defendants' defense counsels proved that Korygiannis had never been to the Dorianiou couple's residence, and therefore, Glezos did not need to provide him with accommodation.

During the trial, the president of the court attempted to obstruct the defendants' defense counsels from proving the facts, rudely telling the plaintiff's witnesses to remain silent. However, when the defendant presented irrefutable evidence, embarrassing the president, he angrily announced the end of the trial.

Although the defendant only presented a few facts to refute the accusation against Glezos, the military judges and prosecutors still stated that they intended to believe the testimony of the political police, regardless of the facts, and continue to try Glezos. Therefore, Glezos remains under threat. (Attached picture)

    希腊反动派诬陷格列索斯完全露了马脚
    辩护人有力地驳倒捏造的“罪状”
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社雅典12日讯：在雅典军事法庭12日对希腊民族英雄格列索斯进行审讯的过程中，被告辩护人用确凿的材料证明了，对格列索斯的控告是根据希腊政治警察局的捏造。
    警察局目前控告格列索斯的根据只有下列事实：即格列索斯曾在1958年8月16日的夜里，在他的姐姐瓦西利基·多利亚尼图和他的姐夫家里同所谓希腊共产党“间谍机关”代表科里雅尼斯会了面。这一控告是根据所谓多利亚尼图夫妇在1958年11月12日所作的如下“供词”而提出的，即他们曾按照格列索斯的请求，在自己家里接待一位外人，看来，这人就是科里雅尼斯，后来，格列索斯曾经同这人会过面。
    负责监视格列索斯的希腊警察局军官帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯和萨凯拉里乌11日和12日在法庭上回答辩护人的问题时都承认，警察们当时并没有看到格列索斯进入他姐姐住的这所房子。
    在12日审讯格列索斯案件的过程中被告辩护人所提供的材料表明，多利亚尼图夫妇的上述“供词”是希腊政治警察局捏造出来而强加于他们的。本来，在多利亚尼图夫妇在1958年11月12日提供上述所谓“供词”以前，即在1958年10月29日，警察局就曾经要求他们“证明”同样的事实，但是，他们当时否认了曾发生过11月12日的“供词”中所提到的事情。
    据多利亚尼图夫妇的辩护人曼加基斯证明，在提出了10月29日的第一个供词之后，多利亚尼图夫妇就被政治警察局毫无根据地加以逮捕和隔离，并且对他们进行所谓“开导”。在两个月的时间里，他们的住所所在街道的居民也经常受到审问。这个辩护人提到了多利亚尼图夫妇写给军事法庭的一封信，证明1958年11月12日的“供词”是警察局强加于他们的。这封信中说，只有1958年10月29日他们的第一次谈话才是符合事实的，而关于格列索斯曾和科里雅尼斯会面的供词是政治警察局用“在心理上施加压力”的办法从他们那里逼出来的。
    多利亚尼图本人12日也在法庭上证实了这一点。她在回答法庭庭长所提出的“你是否坚持这封信中的观点。”的问题时回答说：“是的。”
    格列索斯的辩护人帕帕斯皮鲁、瓦西拉托斯、斯特凡纳基斯和多利亚尼图夫妇的辩护人曼加基斯说：既然这样，就必须确认，关于格列索斯和科里雅尼斯的会面的说法是毫无根据的。曼加基斯同时质问希腊政治警察局根据什么把多利亚尼图夫妇加以隔离，硬要从他们那里得到所需要的供词？
    曼加基斯指出，对格列索斯的控告是政治警察局捏造的。被告的辩护人们也驳倒了对格列索斯的第二个控告，即控告他保证供给科里雅尼斯以住处，也就是说他协助间谍活动。雅典的军事法官们企图用这个控告作为用第三百七十五号法律来对付格列索斯的借口。但是，被告的辩护人对照了各种文件和事实以后证明，科里雅尼斯根本就没有到过多利亚尼图夫妇的住宅，因而，格列索斯用不着为他提供住处。
    在审讯过程中，庭长企图阻挠被告的辩护人们证明事实，粗暴地要原告证人保持沉默。但是，当被告方面提出了驳不倒的证据，使这位庭长感到狼狈不堪的时候，他气得立即宣布本次审讯到此结束。
    尽管被告方面只提出了一点点事实就驳倒了对格列索斯的控告，军事法官和检察官仍然表示，他们打算不顾事实而相信政治警察局的证词，继续对格列索斯进行审判。因此，格列索斯仍然受到威胁。（附图片）
