Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China recently issued a notice regarding activities to commemorate the 1959 "August 1st" Army Day, support the army, and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen.

The notice stated that around this year's "August 1st" Army Day, all regions should, in conjunction with production, appropriately convene some small-scale meetings of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel. They should continue to implement the spirit of the National Congress of Activists of Families of Martyrs, Servicemen, and Disabled, Demobilized, Retired, and Transferred Military Personnel, conduct in-depth political and ideological education for them, and mobilize them to play a greater role in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, leading the masses to achieve results.

The notice requested all regions to carefully examine the work of providing preferential treatment to families of martyrs and servicemen, further arrange the work of preferential treatment for the entire army, and earnestly solve the current living difficulties of families of martyrs and servicemen. For family members of martyrs who have entered homes for the elderly or homes for the elderly for families of martyrs, visits should be conducted one by one to collect their feedback, and any difficulties discovered should be resolved. It is also imperative to provide practical assistance to disabled veterans of the third degree and demobilized veterans suffering from chronic diseases in rural areas who have difficulties in their lives and medical treatment.

The notice concluded by stating that in cities with stationed troops and areas where border and coastal defense troops are located, local people, students, and cadres should be organized to conduct joint activities with the troops, inviting military leaders, combat heroes, or model figures to make reports to the masses, encouraging each other to strengthen the ties between the military and the people. At the same time, it is also necessary to widely publicize the glorious traditions and heroic model figures of the People's Liberation Army, and to strengthen the education of the broad masses of people in supporting the army, giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen, and national defense awareness.

	Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 14th: A military hospital of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet and the Shannan Health Hospital recently jointly established a Shannan Tibetan primary health personnel training class in Zedang, an ancient city in Tibet. According to the planned teaching objectives, the primary health workers trained within half a year will be able to independently diagnose and treat the most common diseases and engage in general health education and disease prevention and health care work.

	The young men and women trainees in this training class are almost all children of serfs or slaves, and they come from all parts of Shannan.

	In the past, there were no Tibetan doctors in the Shannan area, and disease prevention and health work were very poor. Pregnant women mostly gave birth in dirty livestock pens, using broken pieces contaminated with germs to cut the umbilical cord, thus not knowing how many mothers and babies lost their lives.

	The students studying in this training class can eat buttered zanba, rice, and white flour every day. Some students lacked clothing and bedding when they first came to the training class, and the leadership issued them clothing and bedding. When some students' parents came to the training class to see their children and saw that their children were living a happy learning life, and also saw that the teachers and students ate and worked together, as close as fathers, brothers, and sisters, they were deeply moved. The parents urged their children to study hard so that they could benefit the people of their hometown in the future.

    驻西藏某军医院创办藏族卫生人员训练班
    新华社14日电　中华人民共和国内务部最近发出关于纪念1959年“八一”建军节开展拥军优属活动的通知。
    通知说，今年“八一”建军节前后，各地应结合生产，适当召开一些小型烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人会议，继续贯彻全国烈、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人积极分子大会的精神，向他们进行一次深入的政治思想教育，发动他们在增产节约运动中发挥更大的作用，带动群众做出成绩。
    通知要求各地认真检查烈属、军属优抚工作情况，进一步安排全军的优抚工作，切实解决烈属、军属当前的生活困难问题。对于进入敬老院或烈属养老院的烈士家属，要逐一进行访问，搜集他们的反映，发现有困难的应当予以解决。对在乡三等残废军人和患有慢性病的复员军人，在生活和疾病治疗上有困难的，也必须切实帮助解决。
    通知最后说，在有驻军的城市和边防、海防等部队所在地区，应组织当地群众，学生、干部同部队进行联欢活动，邀请部队首长、战斗英雄或模范人物向群众作报告，互相勉励，以加强军民之间的联系。同时，还要广泛地宣传人民解放军的光荣传统和英雄模范人物的事迹，对广大人民群众要加强拥军优属和国防观念的教育。
      新华社拉萨14日电　人民解放军驻西藏部队某部军医院和山南卫生院，最近在西藏古城——泽当合办了一所山南藏族初级卫生人员训练班。根据预定的教学目标，在半年内培养出来的初级卫生工作人员，能单独诊治和处理最常见的疾病，并能从事一般卫生宣传和防疫保健工作。
    在这个训练班受训的青年男女学员，几乎都是农奴或奴隶家的子弟，他们来自山南各地。
    山南地区过去没有藏族医生，防疫卫生工作很差。孕妇们多在肮脏的牲畜栏里生产，用沾染病菌的破片割脐带，因此不知有多少母亲和婴儿从而断送生命。
    在这个训练班学习的学员们每天都能吃到酥油糌粑、大米和白面。有些学员刚来训练班时缺衣少被，领导上都给他们发了衣被。有些学员家长到训练班看望其子女的时候，看到他们的子女过着幸福的学习生活，又看到教师们和学员们同吃、同劳动，亲如父兄姐妹，深受感动，家长们都叮咛自己的子女努力学习，以便将来为家乡人民造福。
