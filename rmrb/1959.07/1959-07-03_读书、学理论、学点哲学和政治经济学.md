    Reading, Studying Theory, and Learning Some Philosophy and Political Economy
    Ouyang Huilin
    Reading, studying theory, and learning some philosophy and political economy are, at present, a very pressing issue for us.
    We are now in a new historical period. Our Party has gone through thirty-eight years. Our Party, leading the people of the whole country, has undergone long, complex, arduous, and tortuous struggles, and finally, after victoriously completing the task of the democratic revolution, launched a socialist revolution, entering a great period of socialist construction. Practice without theoretical guidance is blind practice, and it cannot guide the cause of revolution and construction to victory.
    Doing work and engaging in socialist construction require soaring enthusiasm and revolutionary zeal; it won't do without them. However, if there is only soaring enthusiasm and revolutionary zeal, but a lack of scientific Marxist-Leninist theoretical guidance, it also won't do. Lenin said: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." Practice without theoretical guidance is a blind practice, and it cannot guide the cause of revolution and construction to victory. Especially in a country like China, with its unprecedentedly grand construction scale and historically unparalleled construction speed, and with us being a large country of six hundred and fifty million people, poor and blank, we must build a backward agricultural country into a country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a relatively short period of time, completely changing the current situation. This is indeed a very arduous task. Although we have found a general line for developing socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and have a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, providing a fundamental guarantee for building socialism, it must be admitted that our construction experience is still insufficient, especially lacking experience in the Great Leap Forward, while the course of history demands that we move forward at a faster pace. This is the difficulty we face. We must overcome this difficulty, we must learn things we are not familiar with and do not understand, and one important issue is to strengthen theoretical study and strengthen the guidance of Marxist-Leninist theory to construction practice. Twenty-one years ago, Chairman Mao said at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party: "It is impossible for a party that guides a great revolutionary movement to achieve victory without revolutionary theory, without historical knowledge, and without a deep understanding of the actual movement." This instruction is still useful for engaging in the cause of socialist construction today.
    Economic construction work, in some respects, is even more arduous and complex than revolutionary tasks. Since the Great Leap Forward, some comrades have felt that the more they work, the more developed the work becomes, and the more problems arise, some of which are not easy to solve. Indeed, economic work is becoming more and more detailed. Currently, in the process of construction, many new problems have emerged in economic and social life, such as the comprehensive balance of planning, the planned and proportionate development of the national economy, the issue of production and distribution, the issue of accumulation and consumption, the issue of the interrelationship between various sectors of the national economy, and so on. These all urgently require us to resolve them promptly and properly, otherwise, they will affect the normal progress and development of the cause. There is a situation now where some problems are being solved very slowly, and some measures are not being implemented so smoothly. What is the reason for this? In addition to a lack of experience, there is also the issue that our Marxist-Leninist theoretical level is not high. For many problems, due to a lack of theoretical exploration and solutions based on theoretical principles, there is a lack of consensus in ideological understanding in some aspects, a lack of a common language, everyone doing their own thing, and the existence of blindness. In order to correctly handle the problems existing in the construction process, better build our country, and build socialism faster, I think strengthening theoretical study is a very important aspect of current socialist construction. Learning a little philosophy can solve people's ideological methods and learn how to observe problems; learning a little political economy can enable people to understand the basic laws of the socialist economy and do a better job of economic work.
    However, what theory should we study? Judging from the current situation, we should first study a little philosophy and a little political economy. Learning a little philosophy can solve people's ideological methods, learn how to observe problems, distinguish between essential and non-essential, mainstream and non-mainstream, nine fingers and one finger, so that people can find the interrelationships and objective laws from complex, changing, and developing things, and correctly solve problems. Learning a little political economy can enable people to recognize the basic characteristics of the socialist economy, understand the basic laws of the socialist economy, the laws of planned and proportionate development of the national economy, the principle of distribution according to work, and the issues of commodity production and the law of value under the socialist system, etc., so as to better grasp the objective laws of economic development, overcome one-sidedness, reduce blindness and subjectivism in work, make fewer mistakes and avoid making mistakes, and make our work better. We must make up our minds, squeeze out time, study seriously, think more, and put in hard work.
    For this reason, we must advocate serious reading, invigorate our spirits, and put in hard work to learn. Reading is arduous, and studying theory is even more arduous. Because learning requires using your brain first, having time second, and understanding and remembering third. Any quick, opportunistic, or intermittent method is not feasible. For studying theory, in addition to a small number of cadres and full-time theoretical teams who take turns to study away from their jobs, the requirements for cadres on the job can be different, and the progress of each person can be inconsistent, but everyone must make up their minds, squeeze out time, and as long as they squeeze out half an hour or an hour every day, reading a few pages is fine. Accumulating over the years and persisting, the effect will inevitably be significant. The problem is the fear of not being regular and lacking determination. Reading should become a habit. In the beginning, studying philosophy and political economy and reading some Marxist-Leninist classic works, it doesn't matter if you don't understand much. Practice makes perfect. Read it several times, think more, and take your time, and you can suddenly understand. Theory is nothing more than a reflection of the objective world. We all have some practical experience, and some comrades have relatively rich practical experience, so it is relatively easy to learn theory. However, we should pay attention to combining theoretical study with practical work, and oppose learning that is divorced from reality, because the purpose of learning lies entirely in application.
    In recent years, the atmosphere of studying Marxism-Leninism has been good throughout the province. More and more people are studying philosophy and political economy, and the theoretical level of the entire Party has been greatly improved, but in terms of the rich reality and needs of socialist construction, our theoretical work is still very disproportionate. Theoretical work is very backward compared with practical work. Many comrades have not yet raised the rich reality to the theoretical height it should be, and many comrades are not good at effectively guiding practice with revolutionary theory. On the occasion of the 38th anniversary of the Party, I suggest that we launch a movement of amateur self-study of theory among our on-the-job cadres, learn a little philosophy, learn a little political economy, and further improve our theoretical level to strengthen the Marxist-Leninist theoretical front.

    读书、学理论、学点哲学和政治经济学
    欧阳惠林
    读书，学理论，学点哲学和政治经济学，在目前，对于我们，是一个十分迫切的问题。
    我们现在是处在一个新的历史时期。我们党已经走过了三十八年的历程。我们党领导了全国人民，经历了长期、复杂、艰苦、曲折的斗争，终于在胜利完成了民主革命的任务以后，举行了社会主义革命，进入了一个伟大的社会主义建设时期。没有理论指导的实践，那是一种盲目的实践，它是无法引导革命和建设事业走向胜利的。
    做工作，搞社会主义建设，需要有冲天干劲，革命热情，没有是不行的。但是如果仅仅只有冲天干劲和革命热情，而缺乏科学的马列主义的理论指导，也是不行的。列宁说过：“没有革命的理论，就没有革命的运动。”没有理论指导的实践，那是一种盲目的实践，它是无法引导革命和建设事业走向胜利的。特别像我们中国这样的国家，建设规模空前宏伟，建设速度史无前例，而我们又是一个一穷二白、六亿五千万人口的大国，我们要在不太长的时间内把一个落后的农业国家建设成为具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的国家，彻底改变现在的面貌，确实是一个十分艰巨的任务。虽然，我们已经找到了一条多快好省地发展社会主义建设的总路线，有了一整套的“两条腿走路”的方针，为建成社会主义提供了根本保证；但是，应该承认：我们的建设经验还是很不够的，特别是缺乏大跃进的经验，而历史的进程却又要求着我们不得不以较快的速度前进，这就是我们面前的困难。我们必须克服这种困难，我们必须学会自己不熟悉和不懂的东西，其中一个重要的问题是加强理论的学习，加强马列主义的理论对建设实践的指导。二十一年前毛主席在党的六届六中全会上说过：“指导一个伟大的革命运动的政党，如果没有革命理论，没有历史知识，没有对于实际运动的深刻的了解，要取得胜利是不可能的。”这个指示，对于今天从事社会主义建设事业仍然有用。
    经济建设工作，就某些方面来说，比革命任务还要艰巨、复杂。大跃进以来，有些同志感到工作越作越发展，问题越来越多，有些不大好解决。的确，经济工作是越作越细。目前在建设的过程中，在经济生活中和社会生活中，已经出现了许多新的问题，比如计划的综合平衡问题，国民经济有计划、按比例发展的问题，生产与分配问题，积累与消费问题，国民经济各部门相互关系的问题，等等，都迫切要求我们及时地妥善地加以解决，否则，就会影响事业的正常的前进和发展。现在有一种情况，就是有一些问题解决得很慢，有一些措施贯彻不是那么顺畅，这是什么原因？除了缺乏经验以外，还有一个问题，就是我们的马列主义理论水平不高，对于许多问题，由于缺乏理论上的探讨和根据理论原则去解决，因而在某些方面，出现了思想认识上不一致，缺少共同语言，各行其事，存在着盲目性。为了正确地处理建设过程中存在的问题，更好地建设我们的国家，更快地建成社会主义，我觉得加强理论学习，是当前社会主义建设中一个很重要的方面。学点哲学，可以解决人们的思想方法，学会如何观察问题；学点政治经济学，可以使人们懂得社会主义经济的基本规律，把经济工作做得更好。
    然而学习什么理论？照目前情况来看，首先要学点哲学，学点政治经济学。学点哲学，可以解决人们的思想方法，学会如何观察问题，区别本质与非本质，主流与非主流，九个指头与一个指头，使人们从复杂、变化、发展的事物中找出其相互关系和客观规律，正确解决问题。学点政治经济学，可以使人们认清社会主义经济的基本特点，懂得社会主义经济的基本规律、国民经济有计划、按比例发展的规律、按劳分配的原则以及在社会主义制度下商品生产、价值规律问题，等等，以便更好地掌握经济发展的客观规律，克服片面性，减少工作中的盲目性和主观主义，少犯错误和不犯错误，使我们的工作做得更好。要下决心，挤时间，认真读书，多加思考，下苦功学习。
    为此，就要提倡认真读书，振作精神，下苦功学习。读书是艰苦的，学习理论更为艰苦。因为学习第一要用脑子，第二要有时间，第三要理解、记忆。任何速成、取巧、一曝十寒的办法都是不行的。学习理论，除了一小部分轮流脱产学习的干部和专职的理论队伍以外，对于在职干部来说，各人的要求可以不同，各人的进度可以不一致，但是都要下决心，挤时间，每天只要挤出半小时或一小时，读几页书都可以，积年累月，持久下去，效果就必然显著。问题就怕不经常、缺少决心。读书要养成一种习惯，开始时学哲学和政治经济学、读点马列主义经典著作，不大懂也不要紧，熟能生巧，多读几遍，多加思考，慢慢的来，就可以豁然贯通。理论无非是客观世界的反映。我们都有些实际经验，有的同志实际经验比较丰富，学起理论来还是比较容易的。但是我们要注意做到学习理论与工作实际结合起来，反对脱离实际的学习，因为学习的目的全在于应用。
    近年来，全省学习马列主义的空气是好的。学哲学和学政治经济学的人越来越多，全党的理论水平已经有了很大的提高，但是按照社会主义建设的丰富实际和需要来说，我们的理论工作还非常不相称。理论工作方面与实际工作方面比较起来就显得非常落后。有很多同志还没有把丰富的实际提高到应有的理论高度，有很多同志还不善于运用革命的理论有效地去指导实践。当此党的三十八周年到来的时候，我建议在我们在职干部中开展一个业余的自学的学习理论的运动，学点哲学，学点政治经济学，进一步提高我们的理论水平，以加强马列主义的理论战线。
