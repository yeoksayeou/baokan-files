Recently, Chongqing, the "Mountain City," has been experiencing scorching heat, but its cultural life during rest days has become increasingly rich. In addition to theaters constantly adding new performances, many interesting summer activities have been added in factory and mining areas and charming parks. Parks offer open-air film nights and open-air dances, while stadiums regularly host excellent ball games. Outstanding young actors from the city have also formed mobile performance teams to tour factory and mining areas. Furthermore, workers themselves engage in various cultural and artistic activities such as fine arts, ballads, dance, and drama during their rest days.

Chongqing has recently formed a special mobile team – a joint performance team of young actors – to bring good actors and good programs to the factory areas for touring performances.

In late July, on a typical Sunday evening, small groups of people gathered near a theater in Yangjiaping, a district with a high concentration of machinery and light industry workers. Some were with their children, others were helping their elderly mothers, chatting and laughing as they walked. They enthusiastically discussed the good programs and actors to be performed that night. It turned out that the theater had arranged excellent programs for the workers. These programs included the outstanding drama "Ma Fang Fang Kui," which they had rarely seen since liberation, and "Kneeling at the Door to Eat Grass," which included the stunt of "Shuai Shui Fa". "Ma Fang Fang Kui" was the signature play of the famous Sichuan Opera actor Jia Peiyuan. He had a unique style and creativity in the singing and acting of this play, vividly portraying Chen Rong's inner conflict when he was forced to kill the kind-hearted Kui Er Xiang Gong, even though he usually stood up for justice. Unfortunately, he passed away shortly after liberation. Now, his only disciple, Zhou Jipei, is restaging this good play for the workers.

Just listening to the low-voiced conversations of the audience reveals how satisfied the employees are with the arrangements and performances on their rest days. They enthusiastically praised the young actor Pang Zurong, who played Zhou Ren in "Stepping on the Gauze Hat": "This actor is good, although young, he has a great future, his basic skills, voice, and expressions are all good."

People's interests and hobbies are always diverse. At the Chongqing Municipal Mass Amateur Art School, many people have adopted another way to spend their rest days.

The woodcut research group, consisting of more than twenty workers, has been particularly busy lately. They are creating a set of woodcut paintings. Whenever it is a rest day, they carry their easels to a cool place to create. Now the draft of this album has been finalized, and the plates are currently being engraved.

The sunlight through the glass windows illuminates the pictures particularly brightly, and people are concentrating on their engraving. On the east side of the easel, Yao Xi and Chen Niankun, young fitters from the Chongqing Wangjiang Machine Factory, are collaborating on a large woodcut of "New Look of the Mountain City". These two warriors, who are known for their aggressive and unrelenting spirit in production, are surprisingly meticulous and dexterous. Look, the winding Jialing River and the majestic People's Auditorium are portrayed so delicately and realistically. According to the teachers at the school, Yao Xi and Chen Niankun, like many workers who love amateur art, come to the amateur art school almost every holiday or when the production tasks are completed.

Opposite the woodcut group is the Qingyin class, who are rehearsing the famous "Man-made Satellite in Space." More than thirty young female workers, known as clever girls, are practicing Sichuan Qingyin here. The dance team, ballad class, and music composition group in the amateur art school also attract amateur art lovers. In particular, workers account for more than 70% of the total number of people participating in these activities.

Amateur art activities are becoming increasingly popular in the lives of the people of the Mountain City. Every holiday, when the morning mist has not completely dissipated, various amateur art activity venues throughout the city are already crowded with groups of people.

When the heat has just subsided and night falls, people often like to go to nearby parks to spend this cool summer evening. Recently, the Chongqing municipal cultural departments have often held some small-scale cultural activities in the places people like to visit most, so that people can rest better and have more fun.

One rest day evening, the Xiqu Park in the suburbs of the city was already crowded with people. In the open-air tea garden, people who like to drink tea were in groups of three or tables of five, talking enthusiastically; in the corner of the hall, a large group of chess lovers surrounded the chess players who were in a difficult battle; on the lawn by the creek, bursts of drum beats rang out from time to time, and the students of the construction machine tool factory’s technician class were playing "passing the flower with drums" with great enthusiasm; next to a cluster of green oleanders, Master Feng explained the content of the domestic feature film "Flying Over the Natural Barrier" to his wife and a group of children. A gentle breeze blew from the river, and pleasant music came from the loudspeakers. The film evening began, and people flocked to various screening points. Tonight, the most attractive film was the color film "Flying Over the Natural Barrier" at the first screening point. This film, themed on the People's Air Force's fearless struggle against difficulties, harsh climate, and dangerous snow-capped mountains, deeply moved many viewers. When the pilots finally crossed the overlapping peaks and successfully reached the Kangzang Plateau, warm applause immediately rang out in the crowd, as if they had personally experienced this arduous struggle to open up the Kangzang air route. Another screening point was showing "Warsaw Mermaid." The audience was worried about the safety of the mermaid who represents freedom and justice. A scene appeared on the screen where the evil water monster was instructing its minions to secretly attack the mermaid. When the bandits approached the unknowing mermaid step by step, people clenched their fists nervously. Suddenly, the brave blacksmith arrived, and the water monster was immediately defeated miserably. Only then did people show joyful smiles.

    劳动一周以后
    近来，山城——重庆正是烈日炙人，休息日的文化生活却是越来越丰富。除了影剧场所不断增加新节目的演出外，在厂矿区和景色迷人的公园里，新添了许多有趣的夏令活动。公园里有露天电影晚会、露天舞会，体育馆经常有比较优秀的各种球赛，市内较出色的青年演员也组成轻骑队在厂矿区巡回演出，还有工人们自己在休息日所进行的美术、曲艺、舞蹈、戏剧等各项文艺活动。
    重庆市最近专门组成了一支轻骑队——青年演员联合演出队，把好演员和好节目送到工厂区去作巡回演出。
    7月下旬，一个普通星期日的黄昏，在机械、轻工业工人集中的杨家坪，三三两两的人群拥向一个剧场。有的带着孩子，有的搀着年迈的母亲，说着笑着走了过去。他们热心地谈论着当晚要演出的好节目和好演员。原来这里的剧场为工人们安排了很好的节目。这些节目当中有他们解放后很少看过的优秀剧目“马房放奎”、有包括“甩水发”等绝技的“跪门吃草”等。“马房放奎”是川剧著名演员贾培元的拿手戏。他在这出戏的唱腔和做功上有着独特的风格和创造，把一个平素仗义勇为的陈容，被迫去杀害心地善良的奎二相公时的内心矛盾，刻划得淋漓尽致。可惜解放后不久他就逝世了。现在，他的唯一的弟子周继培，又在舞台上为工人们重新上演这幕好戏。
    只要听听观众的低声交谈，就可知道职工们对休息日剧目的安排和演出是十分满意的。他们热烈赞扬演“踏纱帽”的周仁的青年演员庞祖荣：“这演员不错，年纪虽小，很有前途，基本功夫和嗓音、表情都好。”
    人们的兴趣和爱好总是多样的。在重庆市群众业余艺术学校里，许多人却又采取了另一种休息方式。
    由二十多个工人组成的木刻研究组，近来显得特别忙碌，他们正在创作一套木刻画，每当休息日，他们便背着画架到凉爽地方去创作，现在这一套画册的底稿已经确定了，目前正在刻板。
    透过玻璃窗的阳光把画面照耀得分外明亮，人们都在聚精会神地刻着。在东边的画架旁，重庆望江机器厂的青年钳工尧西和陈年坤正在合作画一幅“山城新貌”的大型木刻，这两位在生产中素以猛冲猛打出名的勇将，想不到却如此心细手巧，你看，那弯弯曲曲的嘉陵江，那巍峨的人民礼堂，却被他们刻划得如此细腻和逼真。据这个学校的教师说，尧西和陈年坤同许多酷爱业余美术的工人一样，差不多每一个休假日，或者当生产任务一完的时候，他们就来到了业余艺术学校。
    木刻组的对面是清音班，他们正在排练有名的“人造卫星太空行”。三十多个被人称为巧姑娘的青年女工们，在这里练习四川清音；业余艺术学校内的舞蹈队、曲艺班、音乐创作组，也同样吸引着业余艺术爱好者们。特别是工人，在这些活动中，他们占总人数的70％以上。
    业余艺术活动在山城人民的生活中越来越受到更多的人的欢迎，每到假日，当晨雾还没有完全消散，在全市各个业余艺术活动场所，就早已挤满了一群又一群的人们。
    当炎热刚退夜幕降临的时候，人们常常喜欢到就近的公园里去消度这凉爽的夏夜。最近，重庆市文化部门常常在人们最喜欢去的地方，举行一些小型的文艺活动，使人们休息得更好，玩得更快乐。
    一个休息日的傍晚，市郊西区公园里早就挤满了熙熙攘攘的人群，露天茶园里，喜欢品茗的人们三人一堆，五人一桌的在热烈交谈；大厅的角落里，一大堆象棋爱好者围着正杀得难解难分的棋手；小溪边的草坪上，不时的响起了阵阵鼓点，建设机床厂技工班的学员们击鼓传花，玩得兴高采烈；在一丛碧绿的夹竹桃旁，冯师傅向他的老伴和一群孩子讲解国产故事片“飞越天险”的内容。微风轻轻地从河面吹来，扩音器里传来了悦耳的音乐。电影晚会开始了，人们纷纷向各个放映点拥去。今晚，最吸引人的要算第一放映点的彩色片“飞越天险”了，这一部以人民空军不畏艰险，和恶劣的气候，险峻的雪山作顽强斗争为主题的影片，使不少观众深深感动，当飞行员们终于越过重重叠叠的山峰，胜利到达了康藏高原上空的时候，人群中立即响起了热烈的掌声，他们也像亲历了这一场开辟康藏航线的艰苦斗争一样。另一个放映点正映“华沙美人鱼”，观众们都正为代表自由和正义的美人鱼的安危而耽心，银幕上出现了邪恶的水妖指使着爪牙们对美人鱼进行暗中袭击的镜头，当匪徒们一步又一步的走近了毫不知晓的美人鱼的时候，人们紧张得个个捏紧了拳头。忽然，勇敢的铁匠赶到了，水妖立刻遭到惨败。人们这时才露出了欢快的笑容。
