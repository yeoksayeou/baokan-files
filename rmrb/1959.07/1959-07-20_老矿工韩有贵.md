    Old Miner Han Yougui
    By Our Correspondent Shā Yīn
    Han Yougui, an old miner with forty years of experience, is currently undergoing a fifty-day summer recuperation at a miners' sanatorium nestled among the mountains and rivers. At only forty-nine years old, he has a ruddy complexion and is full of vigor. After we met, we talked about his sanatorium life and his family situation. He warmly invited me to visit his home.
    Han Yougui's home is located in a row of bungalows diagonally across from the No. 7 inclined shaft of the Tongjialiang Mine. It comprises three rooms: an outer room, an inner room, and a kitchen. The rooms are painted clean white. The outer room contains cabinets and the like, and near the west wall, there is a brand-new Flying Pigeon bicycle. The inner room has several wardrobes and boxes. There is an earthen kang, covered with a dark yellow oilcloth, with neatly folded bedding covered by a snow-white sheet. The walls are adorned with many photographs, including their "family portrait" and souvenir photos of Han Yougui taken during his recuperation in Beidaihe.
    A slightly older girl and a small boy were holding white flour pancakes, seemingly sprinkled with a layer of sugar. When they saw us enter, they shouted at Han Yougui, "Dad, eat a pancake!" Old Han patted the heads of the two children, smiling broadly, and said, "How can you let Dad eat alone and not ask Uncle to eat?" The two children immediately glanced at me and handed me the pancake, saying, "Uncle, you eat!" I praised their cleverness with a smile. At this moment, Han Yougui's wife, wiping her hands with her apron, walked out of the kitchen with a smile, busying herself to invite me to sit in the inner room and poured me a glass of boiled water.
    When the topic turned to "home," Han Yougui became very talkative.
    Han Yougui started working in the mines with his father at the age of nine. His father died when he was thirteen, and his mother passed away when he was fifteen, leaving him with an eleven-year-old sister and a nine-year-old brother. Although his circumstances were so dire, his determination to maintain that "home" never wavered. On the night of his mother's burial, he comforted his young brother and sister in grief, saying, "Don't be afraid, I'll raise you no matter what!"
    In the old society's coal mines, capitalists, in pursuit of profit, did not even provide the most basic safety equipment. Miners in the coal pits were like "a piece of meat between four stones." Cave-ins, gas explosions, floods… countless workers died tragically. In those days, Han Yougui felt the threat of death to his young life more and more clearly every day; however, when he came out of the mine and saw his younger brother and sister waiting for him at the pithead, he also strongly felt the preciousness of his own life. So he gritted his teeth and endured day after day.
    Once, Han Yougui had just gone down into the mine when a roof collapse occurred. A stone slab more than fifty centimeters thick and two meters long crushed him. He was in so much pain that he cried out to his parents, but the foreman turned and ran away. Fortunately, several workers dug him out with their bare hands and carried him to the hospital. The traitorous doctor, seeing that one of his legs was already crushed, said to the workers, "Take him out and feed him to the dogs!" Fortunately, his brother rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and saved him from the brink of death.
    After Han Yougui recovered, he went back down into the mine, limping on one leg. At this time, his view of life became pessimistic. He started smoking opium under the inducement of the foremen. His addiction grew bigger and bigger, and he became so thin that he was just skin and bones. He earned eight or nine yuan for half a month's work, but he could smoke seven yuan worth of opium in a day. In the dead of winter, he wore a pair of pants that were torn at the buttocks, exposing his flesh. At night, he curled up in a corner of a small shop. His elderly uncle came to the mine to see him and advised him to pull himself together, but Han Yougui said, "Uncle, now you and I are sitting here, and I still look like a human being, but who knows if two hours later I will be alive or thrown into the mass grave!"
    Datong was liberated. Han Yougui received guidance and help from the People's Government, quit his opium addiction, and was assigned to Ma Liuhais's tunneling team.
    A happy man is refreshed in spirit. Han Yougui worked very well in tunneling. The workers elected him as the team leader, and the team's production tasks were overfulfilled month after month. His wages were already much higher than in the past, and with the bonuses, his income was even greater. However, he did not save a single penny for several months. One day, Ma Liuhai advised him, "Old Han, you should be careful with your life, it's not like the old days, you should start a family!" These words struck a chord in his heart. That night, he thought to himself, "Yes! In the past, poverty and death forced people to not start a family, but now..." From then on, he quietly started saving money. Coincidentally, the older sister of a squad leader named Hu Jie had lost her husband. After the matchmaking of friends, both parties were willing to become partners and start a family. When they got married, the public assigned him two rooms, and Han Yougui was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth for a long time. He wanted to host a feast to invite the branch secretary and others, but as soon as he mentioned it, the branch secretary turned him down.
    Gradually, Han Yougui entrusted all the household affairs to his wife. At the end of the month, he handed his salary to his wife, saying, "You can use it as you see fit!" His wife knew that he liked to drink a couple of cups of wine, so she would ask the children to buy him some wine every other day. Once, he said to his wife, "I can drink two catties of wine in one sitting, why don't you let me drink my fill!" Upon hearing this, his wife said considerately, "Look at you, the mine is in such tight production, and there are so many children at home, it's not good to ruin your health!"
    A man who had been without a home for most of his life had a home after liberation. He loved this era from the bottom of his heart. The year before last, the mine, considering his age, assigned him to watch the telephone upstairs. He reluctantly worked for five months and refused to continue, saying to the mine director, "I'm still quite strong, let me go down into the mine, otherwise, I'll feel uncomfortable!" When I interviewed him, he brought up this matter again, and I advised him to listen to the mine's arrangements. He said, "Comrade, you don't understand, the Communist Party has given me happiness, and I should just sit back and enjoy it, how can that be?"

    老矿工韩有贵
    本报记者　莎荫
    在依山傍水的矿工疗养院里韩有贵正在作为期五十天的夏季疗养。这位年仅四十九岁具有四十年工龄的老矿工，红光满面，精神焕发。我们见面以后，谈起疗养生活又谈起家庭情况。他热情地邀请我到他家里去坐坐。
    韩有贵的家住在同家梁矿七号井斜对过的一片平房里。占着三间屋，一里一外一间厨房。屋里粉刷得白白净净。外间放着橱柜一类的东西，靠近西墙的地方，有一辆崭新的飞鸽牌自行车。里间放着几只衣柜、箱子。土炕，炕上铺着一块深黄色的油布；被褥在一边叠得整整齐齐，用一幅雪白的单子盖起来。墙上挂着很多照片，有他们的“全家福”，也有韩有贵在北戴河疗养时拍的留念照片。
    一个比较大点的女孩子和一个小男孩手里还拿着白面烙饼，饼上似乎洒着一层白糖。他看见我们进去，就冲着韩有贵喊着：“爸爸，吃饼！”老韩摸着两个孩子的头，满脸春风地笑着说：“怎么能光让爸爸吃，不叫叔叔吃呢？”两个孩子立刻向我翻了翻眼，把饼送到我的跟前说：“叔叔，你吃！”我笑着夸奖了他们的伶俐。这时，韩有贵的老伴一边用围裙擦着手，一边笑着从厨房走出来，忙着让我到里屋坐。并且给我倒了一杯开水。
    提起“家”来，韩有贵的话就多起来了。
    韩有贵九岁上跟着爸爸下窑，十三岁上死了父亲，十五岁上殁了妈妈，家里就留下了他和一个十一岁的妹妹、一个九岁的弟弟。虽然他的遭遇是这样苦，却没有动摇他维持那个“家”的决心。在埋葬了母亲的那个晚上，他沉痛地安慰幼年的弟弟和妹妹说：“不怕，我怎的也把你们拉扯大！”
    旧社会的煤矿中，资本家为了赚钱，井下连最坏的安全设备也没有，矿工在煤窑里，四块石头夹一块肉。塌顶、瓦斯爆炸、水淹……不知道有多少工人死于非命。在那些日子里，韩有贵一天比一天明白地感到死亡对他年青生命的威胁；但是，当他从井下出来，看到在井口等着他的弟弟妹妹，又强烈地感到自己生命的珍贵。于是他咬着牙，一天一天捱下去。
    有一次，韩有贵刚下井，就遇上顶板塌落。一块五十多公分厚、两米多长的石板砸住他。他痛得呼爹叫娘，监工的工头却扭身跑了，多亏有几个工人七手八脚把他挖出来，抬到医院，那个汉奸医生一看他一条腿已经轧断了，就和工人说：“抬出去喂狗吧！”亏着弟弟闻讯赶来，才从死亡的边缘挽救了他。
    韩有贵病好以后，又拐着一条腿下了井。这时，他对人生的看法，变得消极了。他在工头们的引诱下吸食起毒品来，瘾是越吸越大，人瘦得只留下一把骨头。劳动半月赚下八、九块钱，一天就能吸七块钱的鸦片。十冬腊月，穿着一件掉屁股露肉的裤子。晚上卷伏在小店的一个角落里。他的年老的舅父到矿上看他，劝他振作起来，韩有贵却说：“大舅，现在你和我坐着，我还像个人，谁知道两小时以后我是活着呢，还是被丢到万人坑去呢！”
    大同解放了。韩有贵得到人民政府的教导和帮助，戒除鸦片烟瘾，编入了马六孩的掘进组。
    人逢喜事精神爽。韩有贵在掘进中干得挺不错。工人们就选他当了小组长，小组的生产任务又月月超额完成。他的工资本来就比过去高的多，再加上奖励金，收入更多了。可是他几个月没积下一个钱。一天，马六孩就劝他：“老韩，该仔细点过日子啦，现在不像过去，也该成个家啦！”这话可说到他心窝里了。晚上一个人想：“对呀！过去是一个穷，一个死逼得人成不了家，如今……”从那以后，他就悄悄地积起钱来。可巧那时一个叫胡杰的班长的姐姐死了丈夫。经过朋友们说合，双方愿意结成伴侣，成家过日子。结婚的时候，公家拨给他两间房，韩有贵好些时乐得合不上嘴。想办桌席请请支部书记他们，不想他刚一提这件事，就给支部书记顶回去了。
    渐渐地，韩有贵把家里的事都交给老伴管。月终发了薪，他往老伴手里一递：“你自己指划着用吧！”老伴知道他爱喝两盅酒，隔一天不隔一天就让孩子给他打点酒。有一次，他和老伴说，“我的酒量一顿怎的也能喝二斤，你让我痛痛快快喝上一顿吧！”老伴一听，体贴地说：“看你，矿上生产那么紧，家里孩子娃娃一大片，喝坏了身子多不好！”
    一个多半辈子没家的人，在解放以后有了家，他从心底儿热爱这个时代。前年，矿上考虑到他的年纪，就分配他在上边看了电话。他勉强干了五个月，说什么也不干了。冲着矿长说：“我还挺硬朗，叫我下井吧，要不，我心里不好受啊！”我访问他的时候，他又提起这件事来，我劝他听矿上的话，他说：“同志，你不懂啊，共产党给了我幸福，我就坐着去享福，那怎么能成？”
