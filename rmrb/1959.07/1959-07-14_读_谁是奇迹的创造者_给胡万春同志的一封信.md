    Reading "Who is the Creator of Miracles"
    —A Letter to Comrade Hu Wanchun
    Yao Wenyuan
    I read the “Who is the Creator of Miracles” you sent a long time ago. Now I would like to exchange some of my feelings with you.

    Congratulations on your fruitful creations last year! The works collected in this collection have surpassed your previous two collections in terms of both ideological and artistic quality. Last year, many writers and amateur authors in Shanghai actively responded to the Party's call and devoted themselves wholeheartedly to the fiery struggle, enthusiastically using their pens to reflect the unprecedented Great Leap Forward, and a number of excellent short works emerged, and your collection is one of them. Reading this collection, many unforgettable people and events from those exciting days emerged before my eyes. From "Who is the Creator of Miracles," we can see the broad picture of the working class fighting for steel and a series of heroic images of the working class's advanced figures with distinct personalities. In particular, the images of several old workers, each with its own characteristics, are unforgettable and deeply moving. Creating vivid, distinctive, and characteristic images of old workers is the most prominent artistic achievement in your works. Old Ba Dun, Master Bu Gao, Master Quan Gen, Master A San, Master Jiang... their strong sense of responsibility as members of the working class, their selfless class love that runs through every detail of life, their soaring energy that makes all difficulties bow their heads, their down-to-earth spirit that opposes all empty slogans and exaggerations, their vigorous revolutionary optimism, their conscious organizational concept, their humility to the point of shyness when mentioning themselves, and their selfless spirit of self-sacrifice. All of this is so concentrated in the images of several old workers! These are not withered figures, but full, living images. They are ordinary, but also great; we admire them, yet feel close to them. Here, we feel how much creative power is hidden among the working people!

    You come from a family of steel workers, and you are relatively familiar with the workers' past, their joys and sorrows, and their lives. Living in the industrial metropolis of Shanghai, enthusiastically praising the magnificent socialist construction, and creating typical images of heroic figures that fully reflect the spiritual outlook of the working class is naturally your primary task. You once said that workers have different personalities from peasants, and this characteristic should also be reflected in the literary style. I completely agree with your opinion. I hope you will make persistent efforts in this regard.

    In terms of character image, I think "Old Ba Dun" is successful. In the current works depicting steel workers, this character is a very good one. In the process of completing the casting of a forty-six-ton heavy machine part, the image of this burly old worker, with a booming voice, a fiery temper, and absolute loyalty to the Party, is vividly written. I seem to see Old Ba Dun jumping into the pit in one stride, wielding a thirty-five-pound sledgehammer and hitting the rock-hard concrete fiercely; I seem to see Old Ba Dun, like a brave lion, wearing asbestos clothing, laying down asbestos boards, and standing on the five-hundred-degree high-temperature machine frame to do sand cleaning work, his whole body emitting smoke, and the wet towel on his head spraying steam; I seem to see Old Ba Dun quarreling fiercely with Elder Hong of the wood mold section in order to complete the task, and when Elder Hong completed the task after three days and three nights, he hugged his sleeping old comrade with both arms and said with infinite excitement: "My old brother, old brother!..." His whole character is permeated with the characteristics of steel: as strong as steel, as red-hot as molten steel, as upright as steel. His nickname, his voice, his actions, and his physique all remind people of the heaviest, purest, and hardest steel used to cast huge machine parts, the kind of steel that cannot be destroyed by any storm. Old Ba Dun embodies the temperament of a steel worker who lives in a huge collective and has been tempered by long-term operation beside the red-hot molten steel, so Old Ba Dun's typicality is greater than that of other characters. Even people who have never been to a steel factory will be moved by the tense, intense, heroic, and combat-filled labor of Old Ba Dun and his partners.

    However, for your creation, I think "What Happened in the Steel Factory" and "What Master Bu Gao Thought" are more meaningful. Because in your works, vivid images are generally not lacking. Because of your familiarity with life, many scene descriptions are real and vivid, and dryness and conceptualization are rare. The language is also vivid and graphic, not at all dry. This is the strength of your creation. But in some of your works, a certain ideological limitation is manifested. That is: the standing is not high enough, the seeing is not deep enough, and the inherent meaning of a subject is not fully displayed in the work. For example, "Young Girl by the Steel Furnace," what a good material! A young woman participating in steelmaking labor will cause many ideological changes to others and to herself. Unfortunately, you are limited to writing about the process of this matter itself, and the inherent typical meaning of the character Wang Yuhan has not been fully written. For example, you wrote that Wang Yuhan's complexion changed a bit after participating in steelmaking labor, which caused a temporary ideological struggle in her aesthetic concept. This is a very meaningful plot. If it is rendered, expanded, and enriched, then it will touch on the relationship between labor and beauty. If written well, it can convincingly answer some people's wrong ideas and make people think deeply about a question: Where is the beauty in life? Unfortunately, you lightly explained it in a few words. But the above two works are different. Although the characters of Master Bu Gao and Master Quan Gen are also written vividly and movingly, and also make us feel very close, in addition to the emotion that their noble communist style gives us, there is a deeper ideological meaning. In "What Happened in the Steel Factory," there is a completely new type of relationship between people. We see the great power of the rectification movement, which penetrates deep into family life from labor, changing some old concepts in life. Among the working class, the feelings of kinship between father and son are integrated with the feelings of comrades. This not only does not damage the feelings between father and son, but makes them even closer, more moving, and richer. The strong light of communist morality illuminates the hearts of father and son, giving them new love and new happiness. People can see a brand new thing from here, a flash of dazzling communist thought. In this new father-son relationship, how noble, truly happy that can be called happiness is! This makes the family more harmonious, more united, and more affectionate. "What Master Bu Gao Thought" makes people feel a brand-new master-apprentice relationship, showing the great significance of the old workers' practical and meticulous excellent qualities to the growing young workers (this has gone beyond the general scope of the master caring about the apprentice), and touching on an important aspect of the contradictions within the working people. There are not many works like this in this collection. For a writer, the improvement of political thought is particularly important. Improving one's class consciousness and ideological level can make one observe life more deeply. I feel that your works have not yet produced a fully shaped image of a Party worker, which also reflects another aspect of the limitations of your life content and ideological level that deserves attention. If you demand yourself with higher standards, this limitation should be overcome. In the best works, it is necessary to be able to create such typical environments and typical characters: it can spiritually (that is, ideologically) educate readers with a strong communist spirit, and oppose all revisionist fallacies and despicable bourgeois individualism; it can have a high degree of artistic charm aesthetically, and can attract readers and move readers with real, beautiful, and vivid artistic images, deeply exciting the hearts of readers; it can enlighten readers to understand reality through generalized descriptions from a cognitive perspective, so that they can see profound and essential things, that is, truth, from living artistic images.

    The descriptions of scenery in your works are characteristic, the atmosphere is strong, and they are full of color and sound. For example: "The night in the steel factory is gray, red, and fiery. The air is full of the smell of steel and is scorching hot. Masses of hot wind, mixed with the clang of steel collisions, the roar of blowers, and the roar of cranes, roll across the night sky." This vividly depicts a dynamic night scene of a steel factory. When writing about people, you mainly portray their spiritual outlook through the characters' language, appearance, actions, etc., and also use psychological descriptions, but very concisely. Here, I think familiarity with life is closely related to your descriptive skills. For example, in the scene where the task is assigned at the beginning of "Old Ba Dun," Old Ba Dun went from shouting loudly with a fiery voice to controlling his emotions and saying in a low voice: "Director, I should examine myself!" There is not a single psychological description, but Old Ba Dun's character and the ideological changes he has experienced are clearly presented to us. He is full of the working class's integrity and the Party spirit of a Communist Party member. You are obviously very familiar with the character Old Ba Dun, and his tone and attitude most fully express his character characteristics. But in the feature "People Who Grew Up by the Huangpu River," although you spent a lot of effort to describe Shen A Si's psychological activities underwater, I always feel that the feeling is not so strong when I read it, as if there is something separating it. Perhaps you are far less familiar with Shen A Si's life and his character than you are with the steel worker Old Ba Dun. The few articles about the countryside are not as good as those about the steel factory because you are not very familiar with the countryside, and you see people and things mostly as superficial phenomena. I think that being very familiar with life is a foundation of artistic skills, being good at observing and discovering those things with ideological significance and typical significance in life is a prerequisite for mastering artistic skills, and the author's use of artistic language to express the characteristics of life and the characteristics of characters expresses the author's level of mastery of skills. Skills cannot be completely separated from life and thought. Skills are a comprehensive reflection of the author's ability to observe and express life and to use the art of language. It contains ideological factors. If it is separated from the expression of content (life), then the skills will be empty. Skills are for serving the reflection of life. The highest skill is to be able to depict life most vividly, graphically, and profoundly in art.

    You said, "I feel that what I write is all real people and real events, and does not require a great degree of fiction." Therefore, the first part only has "a little" processing, and the second part is completely real people and real events. I think this is your great strength, and it also reflects some of your weaknesses. Life is the source of creation. You base yourself on real people and real events, so most of your works have relatively solid content, a strong breath of life, and none of the anemic paleness that comes from being detached from life. But in the collection, the ones with higher ideological and artistic qualities are still those that have been "a little" processed, which shows that processing is still very important. I disagree with the argument that belittles all real people and real events, because not only is the writer sometimes moved by real people and real events, but the situation sometimes requires us to use our pens to quickly reflect a certain real story. However, as a writer, in order to write works that are more beautiful and more ideal than life in a limited space, one must conduct generalization, concentration, and typification through artistic processing. You once said that there are three processes in a writer's creation: one is being moved by complete real people and real events in life and creating based on them; one is being inspired by a profound thought, and connecting many things in life based on the viewpoint to gradually form characters and stories; one is accumulating many things, and forming stories and characters through analysis. You are mostly in the first situation. If you can also appropriately pay attention to the second and third methods of conception in the future to help the first method of conception and make it more typical, then I think it will be of great benefit to creation.

    My opinions may not be correct. The comments on the gains and losses of your works may not be appropriate either. But one thing you can understand is the concern and expectation of a comrade-in-arms. We are all waiting for your new work. I wish you eternal progress! I wish you can write more excellent works!

### 读“谁是奇迹的创造者”——给胡万春同志的一封信

专栏：文艺创作笔谈

    读“谁是奇迹的创造者”
    ——给胡万春同志的一封信
    姚文元
    寄来的“谁是奇迹的创造者”，早就看过了。现在我想同你交换一下我的一些感受。
    祝贺你去年创作上的丰收！收在这本集子里的作品，在思想性和艺术性上，都超过了你以前的两本集子。去年上海许多作家和业余作者积极响应了党的号召，全身心地投身到火热的斗争中去，热情地用笔反映了史无前例的大跃进，出现了一批优秀的短篇作品，你这本集子就是其中之一。读着这本集子，我眼前就浮起了那些激动人心的日子里许多永远也不会忘记的人和事。从“谁是奇迹的创造者”中，我们可以看见工人阶级为钢而战的广阔的生活图画，可以看见一系列性格鲜明的工人阶级先进人物的英雄形象。其中特别是几个各有特色的老工人的形象，令人久久难忘，受到强烈的感动。创造了生动、鲜明富有特色的老工人的形象，这是你作品中最突出的艺术成就。老八吨，步高师傅，全根师傅，阿三师傅，姜师傅……他们身上那种强烈的工人阶级的责任感，贯串在一切生活细节中的无私的阶级友爱，叫一切困难低头的冲天干劲，反对一切空喊和浮夸的脚踏实地的精神，蓬蓬勃勃的革命乐观精神，自觉的组织观念，谦逊到提起自己就害羞的纯朴，从不顾惜自己的自我牺牲精神。这一切，是多么集中地体现在几个老工人的形象里！这不是枯瘪的人物，而是丰满的、活生生的形象。他们平凡，但又伟大；我们钦佩，又感到亲切。这里，我们感到劳动人民当中蕴藏着多么巨大的创造力！
    你出身于钢铁工人，工人的昨天，工人的甘苦，工人的生活，都比较熟悉。生活在上海这个工业大城市里，热情地歌颂壮丽的社会主义建设，创造出充分地反映工人阶级精神面貌的英雄人物的典型形象，自然是你首要的任务。你曾经说过，工人有和农民不同的性格，文学风格上也要表现出这种特点。我完全同意你这个意见。希望你在这方面作持久的努力。
    就人物形象而论，我觉得“老八吨”是成功的。在目前描写钢铁工人的作品中，这个人物是很不错的一个。在完成浇铸四十六吨重的大机件的过程中，这个身材魁梧，声如洪钟，性子火暴而对党绝对忠诚的老工人的形象，写得栩栩如生。我好像看见老八吨一个箭步跳下地坑，抡起三十五磅重的大锤，狠狠地锤着铁硬的混凝土；我好像看见老八吨像一头勇猛的狮子那样穿着石棉衣，铺上石棉板，站在五百度高温的机架上做清砂工作，混身冒着烟雾，头上的湿毛巾喷着蒸气；我好像看见老八吨为了完成任务暴燥地同木模工段长老洪闹翻了，当老洪三天三夜完成了任务之后，他双臂抱起睡着了的老战友，无限激动地说：“我的老兄弟，老兄弟！……”他的整个性格，处处渗透着钢的特征：钢一样坚强，钢水一样红热，钢材一样耿直。他的绰号，他的声音，他的行动和他的体态，无一不使人想到铸成巨大机件的那种最沉最纯最硬的钢，那种任何风暴都摧不垮的钢。老八吨身上，表现着生活在巨大的集体中、长期在通红的钢水旁操作而锻炼出来的钢铁工人的气质，因此较之别的人物，老八吨的典型性就更大。即使没有到过钢厂的人，也会被老八吨和他的伙伴那种紧张、剧烈、英勇、充满战斗的劳动所感动。
    但是，对于你的创作来说，我却觉得“在钢铁厂发生的事情”和“步高师傅所想到的”，更有意义。因为在你的作品中，生动的形象，一般说来是不缺乏的。由于你对生活的熟悉，很多场景的描写都真实而生动，枯燥、概念化很少。语言也是生动而形象的，一点也不干瘪。这是你创作的长处。但是在你一部分作品中，却表现出一定的思想上的局限性。就是说：站的还不够高，看得还不够深，没有把一个题材内在蕴藏的意义，充分地在作品中显示出来。例如“炼钢炉旁的年轻姑娘”，多么好的素材！一个女青年参加炼钢劳动，对别人和对她自己，都会引起很多思想变化的。可惜你只限于写出这个事情本身的过程，王玉含这个人物身上内在的典型意义没有充分地写出来。例如你写到王玉含因为参加炼钢劳动之后，脸色有些变化，她在审美观念上引起了一时的思想斗争。这是一个很有意义的情节，如果渲染一下，展开一下，加以丰富，那么，就接触到一个劳动和美的关系，写得好，可以很有说服力地回答有一些人的错误观念，并且引人深思一个问题：生活中的美在哪里？可惜你几句话就轻轻地交代过去了。可是上述的两篇作品中却不同，虽然步高师傅和全根师傅的性格，同样写得生动而感人，同样使我们感到很亲切，但除了他们崇高的共产主义风格给我们的感动外，还有更深一层的思想意义。“在钢铁厂发生的事情”里，有一种完全新型的人和人的关系，我们看见了整风运动的伟大力量，从劳动一直透入了家庭生活的深处，改变着生活中某些陈旧的观念。工人阶级当中，父子的亲属的感情和同志的感情融化在一起，这不但没有使父子感情受到损害，反而更加亲密、更加感人、更加丰富了。共产主义道德的强烈的光芒，照亮了父与子的心灵，给予他们以新的爱情和新的幸福，人们可以从这里看到一种崭新的东西，有耀眼的共产主义思想的闪光。在这种新的父子感情中，有多么崇高的、真正可以称之为幸福的那种幸福呵！这使得家庭更加和睦、更加团结、更加亲爱了。“步高师傅所想到的”，则使人感到一种全新的师徒关系，显示出老工人那种切切实实、一丝不苟的优良品质对于正在成长的青年工人的重大意义（这已经超出了一般的师傅关心徒弟的范围），并且接触到劳动人民内部矛盾的一个重要方面。像这样的作品，这本集子里还不是很多的。对于一个作家，政治思想上的提高特别重要。提高自己的阶级觉悟和思想水平，能对生活观察得更深些。我觉得你的作品中还没有出现过一个塑造得很丰满的党的工作者的形象，也反映出你生活内容和思想水平的另一方面值得注意的局限性。如果用更高的标准要求自己，这个局限性是应当努力突破的。在最好的作品中，要能够创造出这样的典型环境和典型人物：它在精神上（即思想意识上）能用强烈的共产主义精神教育读者，同一切修正主义的谬论和卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义相对立；在美学上能够有高度的艺术魅力，能够用真实、优美而生动的艺术形象来吸引读者和感动读者，深深地激动着读者的心；从认识上能通过富有概括性的描写来启示读者认识现实，使他们从活生生的艺术形象中看到深刻的、本质的东西，也就是真理。
    你的作品中，景物的描写是有特色的，气氛强烈，富有色彩感和声音感。如：“钢厂的夜，是灰蒙蒙的、红火火的。充满钢铁腥味的空气，是灼热的。成团的热风，夹带着锵锵的钢铁碰击声、鼓风机的咆哮声、行车的轰鸣声，在夜空中滚过。”这很鲜明地描绘出一幅钢厂跃动的夜景。写人，你主要是通过人物的语言、外貌、动作等等来刻划他的精神面貌，也用心理描写，但很简洁。这里，我觉得生活的熟悉对你的描写技巧有很大关系。如“老八吨”里一开始交代任务的那个场面，老八吨由冒火地直着嗓门大叫到控制住自己的感情低低地说：“厂长，我应该检讨！”没有一句心理描写，但老八吨的性格和他经历的思想变化，却很清楚地在我们眼前出现了。他充满了工人阶级的正直和共产党员的党性。你对老八吨这个人物显然很熟悉，他的说话的声调、态度就最充分地表现着他的性格特色。但“生长在黄浦江边的人”这篇特写中，你虽然花了不少笔墨去描写沈阿四在水下的心理活动，但我读上去总觉感受不是那么强烈，好像隔了一层什么似的。大约你对沈阿四的生活和他的性格，都远不如你对钢铁工人老八吨熟悉。写农村的几篇不如写钢厂的，就因为你对农村还不是很熟悉，看人看事还是表面现象居多。我觉得，对生活的十分熟悉是艺术技巧的一个基础，善于观察、发现生活中有思想意义和典型意义的那些事物，是掌握艺术技巧的一个前提，作者运用艺术语言来表现生活的特色和人物的特色，则表现着作者掌握技巧的水平。技巧同生活、思想是不能完全分开的，技巧是作者对生活的观察力、表现力和运用语言艺术的才能的一种综合，它含有思想的因素。如果离开了表现内容（生活），那技巧就脱空了。技巧是为反映生活服务的，最高的技巧就是能从艺术上最生动、最形象、最深刻地描绘生活。
    你说，“我觉得写的都是真人真事，不需要很大程度的虚构。”因此第一部分只有“一点儿”加工，第二部分则完全是真人真事。我觉得这正是你很大的优点，又反映了你某些弱点。生活是创作的泉源，你以真人真事为基础，所以多数作品内容都比较扎实，有浓厚的生活气息，没有那种因脱离生活而来的贫血的苍白。但就在集子中，思想性和艺术性比较高的也还是属于加过“一点儿工”的那些作品，可见加工也还是很重要的。我不同意那种贬低一切写真人真事的论调，因为不仅有时作家确为真人真事所激动，而且形势有时候需要我们用笔迅速地反映某一个真实的故事。但是，作为一个作家，要在有限的篇幅中写出比生活更美、更理想的作品，就必须通过艺术加工进行概括、集中、典型化。你有一次说过，作家创作有三种过程：一种是受生活中完整的真人真事所感动，以它为基础进行创作；一种是受到一个深刻的思想的启发，由观点而把生活中许多事情串起来，逐步形成人物和故事；一种是由积累了许多事情，经过分析而形成故事和人物。你是第一种情况居多。如果今后也能适当注意到第二种和第三种构思的方法，用以帮助第一种构思，使它更加典型化，那我想对创作一定有很大好处的。
    我的这些意见，未必正确。对你的作品的得失所发的议论，也未必恰当。但是有一点你是可以理解的，那就是作为一个战友的关怀和期望。我们都在等待着你的新作。祝你永远前进！祝你能写出更优秀的作品！
