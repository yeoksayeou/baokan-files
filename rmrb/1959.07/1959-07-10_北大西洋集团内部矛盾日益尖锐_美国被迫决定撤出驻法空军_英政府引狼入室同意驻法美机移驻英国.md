    Reported by this newspaper: The negotiations between France and the United States regarding the issue of the United States storing atomic bombs on French territory have finally broken down. On June 8th, a spokesperson for the North Atlantic Group's General Norstad headquarters issued a statement deciding to relocate the U.S. Air Force stationed in France to Britain and West Germany. The unprecedented deterioration of U.S.-French relations has led the contradiction-ridden North Atlantic aggressive group into a new stage of crisis.

    France's demand to share atomic secrets and jointly control nuclear warheads with the US and Britain, otherwise it would not allow the United States to store atomic weapons on its territory, has long been called the number one thorny issue within the North Atlantic Group by Western newspapers. Since de Gaulle came to power, he has repeatedly demanded that France should be on an equal footing with the United States and Britain, implement "three-way" leadership within the North Atlantic Group, and participate in the "atomic club." However, when de Gaulle made these demands in letters to Eisenhower and Macmillan last September, he was rejected by Washington and London. But de Gaulle did not give up. Since the beginning of this year, France has created a series of "troubles" for the US and British "Atlantic defense" plans. First, it refused to allow the United States to set up missile bases in France, then it declared that the French strategic air force would not be under the command of the North Atlantic Group, then it announced that the French Mediterranean fleet would not be controlled by the North Atlantic Group in wartime, and finally it refused to store American atomic weapons on its territory.

  The United States has exerted various pressures on France's demands, attempting to make France back down. Allied Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group, Norstad, repeatedly threatened a month ago that if France did not allow the United States to store atomic weapons in France, he would withdraw the American Air Force stationed in France to show that he was not threatened by de Gaulle.

    However, de Gaulle did not succumb to this pressure, finally leading to the current open break.

    This break is causing great shock in the West. The British "Daily Mail" believes that "this is bound to disrupt the West's tactical arrangements, and the disturbing thing is precisely this." "The Times" commented: "On the eve of the resumption of the Foreign Ministers' meeting, it is inevitable that a North Atlantic Treaty Organization country refuses to give General Norstad the convenience he needs, which is bound to cause some political damage."

    Not only that, but the United States' relocation of part of its Air Force stationed in France to Britain has also caused unease and opposition in British political circles and public opinion. When British Defense Minister Sandys announced in the House of Commons on the 8th that Britain had agreed to the relocation of U.S. Air Force units stationed in France to Britain, a chorus of "shameless" condemnations rang out in the House of Commons. As a staunch follower of the American nuclear war policy, the British government has long expressed its eagerness to accept the American Air Force units that France refused to accept. However, announcing this just as British officials are calling for friendship with France and talking about inviting de Gaulle to visit Britain adds to the irony of the delicate relations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. Sandys admitted that the decision of American aircraft to transfer bases is a manifestation of the contradictions between France and the main member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The British people's movement to ban nuclear weapons, strive for disarmament, and abolish American military bases is becoming increasingly strong. The British people are increasingly aware that the more Britain relies on the American nuclear war policy, the more it will succumb to the will of the United States, and the greater the danger faced by the British people.

    北大西洋集团内部矛盾日益尖锐
    美国被迫决定撤出驻法空军
    英政府引狼入室同意驻法美机移驻英国
    本报讯　法国和美国就美国在法国领土上储存原子弹问题进行的谈判，终于最后破裂。6月8日，北大西洋集团的诺斯塔德将军总部发言人发表声明，决定把美国驻法空军部队移驻英国和西德。美法关系的空前恶化，使矛盾重重的北大西洋侵略集团进入了一个新的危机阶段。
    法国要求同美英分享原子秘密和共同控制核弹头，否则就不许美国在它的领土上存放原子武器的作法，早已被西方报刊称为北大西洋集团内的头号棘手问题。戴高乐上台后，连续要求法国应同美、英平起平坐，在北大西洋集团内实行“三巨头”领导，并参加“原子俱乐部”。但去年9月戴高乐给艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦的信件中，提出这些要求时，就遭到华盛顿和伦敦的拒绝。但戴高乐并不罢休，今年以来，法国对美、英的“大西洋防务”计划制造出一系列“麻烦事件”。先是拒绝美国在法国设置导弹基地，然后声明法国战略空军不归北大西洋集团指挥，接着，又宣布法国地中海舰队在战时不受北大西洋集团控制，最后则拒绝在它的领土上存放美国原子武器。
  美国对法国的要求施加了种种的压力，企图使法国知难而退。北大西洋集团盟军最高司令诺斯塔德曾在一个月以前就一再扬言，如果法国不让美国在法国储存原子武器，他就要撤出美国驻法国的空军，以示不受戴高乐的威胁。
    但是，戴高乐并没有在这个压力下屈服，终于引起现在的公开决裂。
    这一决裂正在引起西方的巨大震动。英国“每日邮报”认为，“这必然要打乱西方的战术安排，而令人不安的正是这一点。”“泰晤士报”的评论说：“在外长会议复会前夕，一个北大西洋公约组织国家拒绝让诺斯塔德将军得到他所需要的便利，这必然不幸地要造成某种政治上的损害。”
    不仅如此，美国把它驻法国的空军的一部分移驻英国，还引起了英国政界和舆论的不安和反对。当英国国防大臣桑迪斯8日在下院宣布英国同意美国驻法空军部队移驻英国的时候，下院响起了一片“无耻”的叱责声。作为美国核战争政策的顽固的追随者，英国政府长期以来一直表示他们热切地希望接受法国拒绝接受的美国空军部队。但是，正当英国官方人士要求同法国友好并且谈论着邀请戴高乐访问英国的时候来宣布这件事，这就增加了对北大西洋公约组织盟国之间的微妙关系的讽刺。桑迪斯承认，美国飞机转移基地的决定是法国和北大西洋公约组织主要成员国之间矛盾的表现。英国人民争取禁止核武器、争取裁军及撤销美国军事基地的运动，正在越来越强大。英国人民越来越清楚地认识到：英国越依附美国的核战争政策，它就越屈从美国的意志，而英国人民面临的危险也就越大。
