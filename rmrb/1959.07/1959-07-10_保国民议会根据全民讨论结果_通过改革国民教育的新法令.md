Xinhua News Agency, Sofia—Since Bulgaria launched a nationwide discussion of the draft basic principles on reforming the education system adopted by the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee's April Plenum, more than 400,000 people from all walks of life in urban and rural areas enthusiastically participated in the discussion and put forward more than 40,000 suggestions. Based on the results of the nationwide discussion, the Bulgarian National Assembly's Third Extraordinary Session passed a new decree on the 3rd, "On Making Education More Closely Linked to Life and Further Developing Bulgarian National Education."

The decree pointed out that the main task of Bulgarian schools is to educate young people on how to live in a socialist and communist society, and to cultivate the younger generation with a spirit of respect for communist principles, love of labor, socialist patriotism, and proletarian internationalism through a combination of education and socially beneficial and productive labor.

The decree stated that the new secondary technical education is an education that combines general education, labor education, and technical education with production education. The length of schooling is set at twelve years, divided into two stages: basic education (from first grade to eighth grade) and secondary education - higher grades (from ninth grade to twelfth grade).

The decree pointed out that basic education is to enable students to acquire knowledge of general education and comprehensive technical education, to lay a solid foundation for moral, physical, and aesthetic education, and to enable students to establish a correct attitude towards labor and develop labor habits.

The decree stated that the basic task of secondary education (higher grades) is to cultivate educated and cultured citizens for all aspects of life, enabling them to actively participate in the work of industry, construction, agriculture, and culture. Through production education, students should master at least one widely used specialized knowledge.

The decree stated that according to the economic conditions of various regions, each secondary technical school will set up one or several majors in industry, agriculture, construction, and other fields. After graduating from secondary technical school, regardless of the major studied, students can continue their studies in all universities and specialized schools.

The decree stipulates that the training of specialized talents in higher education will be combined with students' participation in professional production labor.

According to the new decree, the reorganization of national education will begin in the 1960-1961 academic year and will be completed within four to five years. Production education will be implemented starting from the 1959-1960 academic year.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia—According to a report by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency: This year, thousands of agronomists, doctors, engineers, and economists graduating from Bulgarian universities will contribute their knowledge and strength to the cause of the motherland's prosperity.

The 256 young men and women who graduated from the Sofia Dimitrov Agricultural Academy recently received agronomist certificates and have been assigned to agricultural production cooperatives in various places to participate in work.

Currently, production team leaders, chairmen, animal husbandry experts, agronomists, and others from agricultural production cooperatives in various places who are participating in correspondence studies at the Agricultural Academy have begun studying and taking examinations. In Bulgaria, 3,000 correspondence students study at universities every year, studying more than 70 majors.

In the era of people's power in Bulgaria, more than 60,000 people have received higher education, of which 10,000 have become doctors, 9,000 have become engineers, and 6,000 have become agronomists and animal husbandry experts. In addition, 125,000 secondary technical talents have been trained for various national economic sectors.

    保国民议会根据全民讨论结果
    通过改革国民教育的新法令
    新华社索非亚讯　自从保加利亚展开全民讨论保共中央四月全会通过的关于改革教育制度的基本原则草案以来，全国城乡各界有四十多万人热烈地参加了这一讨论，并且提出了四万多项建议。保加利亚国民议会第三次非常会议根据全民讨论的结果，在3日通过了一项“关于教育更加密切联系生活和进一步发展保加利亚国民教育”的新法令。
    法令指出，保加利亚学校的主要任务是教育青年如何在社会主义和共产主义社会中生活，通过教育同社会公益劳动和生产劳动相结合的方法，用尊重共产主义原则、热爱劳动、社会主义爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的精神来培养青年一代。
    法令说，新的中等技术教育是普通教育、劳动教育和技术教育同生产教育相结合的教育，修业期限定为十二年，分为基础教育（从一年级到八年级）和中等教育——高年级（从九年级到十二年级）两个阶段。
    法令指出，基础教育是使学生获得普通教育和综合技术教育的知识，为进行德育、体育和美育方面的教育打下牢固的基础，并使学生树立起正确的劳动态度，养成劳动习惯。
    法令说，中等教育（高年级）的基本任务是：为生活的各个方面培养有教养、有文化的公民，使他们能够积极参加工业、建筑业、农业和文化等部门的工作。通过生产教育，使学生至少能掌握一种广泛运用的专门知识。
    法令说，根据各个地区的经济情况，每个中等技术学校将设置一个或数个工业、农业、建筑业和其他方面的专业。在中等技术学校毕业后，无论学什么专业，都可以在一切大学和专科学校继续学习。
    法令规定，高等学校培养专门人材将和学生参加专业方面的生产劳动结合起来。
    按照新的法令，国民教育的改组将从1960—1961学年开始，在四、五年内完成。生产教育将从1959—1960学年开始实施。
    新华社索非亚讯　据保加利亚通讯社报道：今年从保加利亚高等学校毕业的数千名农艺师，医生，工程师和经济学家即将把自己的知识和力量贡献给祖国繁荣的事业。
    从索非亚季米特洛夫农业科学院毕业的二百五十六名男女青年，不久前已领到了农艺师的证书，并已分赴到各地的农业生产合作社参加工作。
    目前，参加农业科学院函授学习的各地农业生产合作社的生产队长、主席、畜牧专家、农艺师等已经开始学习和考试。在保加利亚，每年有三千名函授生在高等学校学习，他们学习七十多项专业。
    保加利亚在人民政权的年代里，已经有六万多人受过高等教育，其中一万人成为医生，九千人成为工程师，六千人成为农艺师和畜牧专家。此外，尚为各国民经济部门培养了十二万五千名中等技术人材。
