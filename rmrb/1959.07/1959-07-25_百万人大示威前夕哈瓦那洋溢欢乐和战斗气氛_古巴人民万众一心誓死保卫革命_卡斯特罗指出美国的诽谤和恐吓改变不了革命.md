Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 23rd (Reporter Kong Mai) reports: Havana is already presenting a scene of fervent festivity and solemnity on the eve of the holiday. On July 26th, one million people, accounting for one-sixth of Cuba's national population, will hold a rally here to demonstrate the firm resolve of the Cuban people to defend land reform and oppose foreign interference.

	Hundreds of thousands of farmers are pouring into the capital like a tide from the country's six provinces. Trains, cars, buses, ships, and airplanes are ceaselessly filled day and night with the owners of Cuban land arriving in this revolutionary city – Havana – which faces the Florida peninsula of the United States.

	The cavalry regiment led by Chief of Staff Cienfuegos of the Rebel Army, consisting of one thousand horsemen, is advancing solemnly towards the capital day and night, braving wind and rain.

	In the encampment of the guidance committee of the July 26th rally preparatory committee, items like clothes, food, canned goods, blankets, shoes, and hats, donated by Havana residents to their farmer brothers, are piled up like a mountain. Young men and women wearing the red and black armbands of the "July 26th Movement" are here distributing gifts to the farmers and arranging accommodation. A female leader of the guidance committee told reporters that the originally estimated number of 500,000 farmers has already been exceeded. She said that thousands upon thousands of farmers who did not receive invitations have arrived in the capital at their own expense. Many farmers arriving in the capital are staying in the famous "Hall of Mirrors" of the Presidential Palace, luxury hotels, government departments, factories, and schools, receiving VIP treatment. Fidel Castro personally received the farmers staying at the Hilton Hotel, warmly discussing land reform and the development of agricultural production with them. The Propaganda and Education Department of the "July 26th Movement" has sent dozens of propagandists to the farmers' residences to organize forums to explain the Land Reform Law.

	The residents of all sectors of the city and the farmers are filled with passionate and sincere feelings. 100,000 Havana residents participated in the work of receiving the farmers. Various service industries are providing free services to the farmers; in the shops, farmers can buy straw hats and small national flags they need for the rally at low prices; many hospitals are registering them for free; and the Lions Club is showing movies to the farmers, and the Naval Band is holding concerts for them in the Central Park every evening.

	Various branches of the Revolutionary Army are stepping up their training in preparation for participating in the review on July 26th.

	The upcoming Havana Farmers' Congress has attracted the attention of all Latin American countries. More than 150 representatives and journalists from fifteen Latin American countries will be invited to attend the conference.

	On the eve of the grand rally on July 26th – the sixth anniversary of the attack on the Moncada Barracks – the fighting spirit of the Cuban people is overflowing, both in the capital and throughout the country. Fidel Castro said yesterday that the conference will prove that all Cubans are prepared to defend the revolution at any cost.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 23rd – The Cuban people are eagerly requesting Castro to quickly resume the post of Prime Minister.

	Since Castro issued a statement on the 17th resigning from the post of Prime Minister, the masses in Havana have held rallies and parades for days, demanding that he continue to serve as Prime Minister and support the revolutionary government. Workers in the capital Havana and across the country responded to the call of the Cuban Workers' Federation and held a one-hour strike on the morning of the 23rd, expressing their firm demand that Castro quickly resume his post as Prime Minister. At the same time, petitions from various mass organizations requesting Castro to continue serving as Prime Minister flooded government offices.

	After holding a meeting on the night of the 21st, the Cuban Cabinet once again decided to reject Castro's resignation and requested that he resume the post of Prime Minister as soon as possible. Prior to this, the Cabinet sent a delegation to visit Castro for this purpose. Castro said at a rally of the Textile Workers' Union on the 22nd that the people will make a decision on the issue of his reinstatement at the grand rally on July 26th.

	This rally of the Textile Workers' Union was also held to demand that Castro quickly return to his position as Prime Minister. A leader of the Textile Workers' Union said to Castro that the thousands upon thousands of farmers who are now in Havana preparing to participate in the July 26th rally are "prepared to stay here until you continue to serve as Prime Minister." Speaking at the rally of the Textile Workers' Union, Castro strongly criticized the imperialist slanderous propaganda against Cuba and called on the people to be vigilant. He pointed out that "various kinds of foreign-made news are to a large extent intended to embolden domestic conspirators," but the imperialist slanderous propaganda "is just a mantis trying to stop a chariot," and "instead, it has consolidated the revolution." He said, "We are acting here in accordance with our revolutionary laws, and we are implementing a completely free and autonomous policy, and no force in the world can subdue our people."

	Castro said, "All Cubans support the revolution and are prepared to defend the revolution at all costs. If proof is needed, just look at the farmers' conference (to be held on July 26th). Just look at the farmers in Havana holding machetes. The machetes are used to defend the revolution, deal with traitors, enemies of the motherland, reactionaries, and counter-revolutionary activities." He emphasized that we are prepared to defend the revolution with all weapons, even with our teeth and fists. No one can change the fate of the revolution, because the people are passionately guarding it, the slander and defamation in the US Senate cannot change the revolution; flattering attitudes cannot change the revolution; and threats and intimidation tactics such as the Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Americas cannot change the revolution either.

    古巴人民万众一心誓死保卫革命
    卡斯特罗指出美国的诽谤和恐吓改变不了革命
    新华社哈瓦那23日电　本社记者孔迈报道：哈瓦那已经呈现一片节日前夕的热烈和庄严的景象。在7月26日，占古巴全国人口六分之一的一百万人，将在这里举行集会，显示古巴人民保卫土地改革和反对外国干涉的坚强决心。
    几十万农民像潮水一样从全国六个省份涌向首都。火车、汽车、公共汽车、船舶和飞机日夜不停地满载着古巴土地的主人到达这个与美国佛罗里达半岛对峙的革命城市——哈瓦那。
    起义军参谋长西恩富戈斯所率领的由一千名骑士组成的马队，正夜以继日地冒着风雨庄严地向首都前进。
    在7月26日大会筹备委员会的指导委员会的营帐里，像山一样堆满了哈瓦那居民赠送给农民兄弟的衣服、食品、罐头、毯子、鞋、帽等物品。带着“7月26日运动”红黑臂章的小伙子和姑娘们在这里给农民分配礼物和安排住所。指导委员会一位女负责人对记者说，原来预计的五十万农民的数字已经超过。她说，千千万万没有接到邀请的农民自备路费辗转乘车来到了首都。抵达首都的许多农民住在总统府著名的“镜厅”、豪华的饭店、政府各部、工厂和学校里，受到贵宾一般的接待。菲德尔·卡斯特罗亲自在希尔顿饭店招待了住在那里的农民，同他们热烈地讨论土地改革和发展农业生产的问题。“7月26日运动”宣传教育部派出了数十名宣传员，到农民的住地组织座谈会，讲解土地改革法。
    城市各阶层居民和农民之间充满了热情和诚挚的感情。十万哈瓦那人参加了招待农民的工作。各个服务性行业免费为农民服务；在商店中，农民可以廉价买到他们在集会时需用的草帽和小国旗；许多医院免费给他们挂号；狮子俱乐部为农民放映电影，海军乐队每天晚上在中央公园为他们举办音乐会。
    革命军各兵种正在加紧操练，准备在7月26日参加检阅。
    即将来到的哈瓦那农民大会引起了所有拉丁美洲国家的注意。十五个拉丁美洲国家的一百五十多名代表和记者将应邀参加大会。
    在7月26日——进攻蒙卡达兵营六周年纪念日——举行盛大集会的前夕，不管是在首都，还是在全国，都洋溢着古巴人民的战斗精神。菲德尔·卡斯特罗昨天说，大会将证明，所有的古巴人准备不惜任何代价地保卫革命。
    新华社哈瓦那23日电　古巴人民热切地要求卡斯特罗迅速恢复总理的职务。
    自从卡斯特罗在17日发表辞去总理职务的声明以来，哈瓦那的群众曾经连日举行集会和游行，要求他继续担任总理和拥护革命政府。首都哈瓦那及全国各地的工人响应古巴工人联合会的号召，在23日上午举行了一小时的罢工，表示坚决要求卡斯特罗迅速恢复他的总理职务。同时，各个群众团体要求卡斯特罗继续担任总理的请愿书大量涌向政府办公室。
    古巴内阁在21日夜间举行会议以后，再次决定拒绝卡斯特罗的辞呈，要求他尽快地恢复总理职务。在这以前，内阁为此派代表团访问了卡斯特罗。卡斯特罗22日在纺织工人联合会的集会上表示，关于他复职的问题，在7月26日的盛大集会上，人民会作出决定。
    纺织工人工会这次集会也是为要求卡斯特罗迅速回到他的总理职位而举行的。纺织工人联合会的一位领袖对卡斯特罗说，现在到哈瓦那准备参加7月26日集会的成千上万的农民，“准备留在这里，直到你继续担任总理为止”。卡斯特罗在纺织工人联合会的集会上讲话时强烈抨击帝国主义对古巴的诽谤宣传，并且号召人民提高警惕。他指出，“外国制造的各种消息在很大程度上是为了给国内的阴谋者打气”，但是帝国主义的诽谤宣传“只不过是螳臂挡车”，“反而使革命得到了巩固”。他说，“我们在这里按照我们的革命法律行事，我们执行完全自由和自主的政策，世界上没有力量能使我国人民屈服。”
    卡斯特罗说，“全体古巴人都支持革命，并且准备不惜一切代价来保卫革命。假如要证明的话，就瞧瞧（在7月26日举行的）农民大会吧。就瞧瞧哈瓦那手持弯刀的农民吧。弯刀是用来保卫革命、对付叛徒、祖国的敌人、反动派和反革命活动的。”他强调指出，我们准备用一切武器，甚至用我们的牙齿和拳头来保卫革命。任何人不能改变革命的命运，因为人民热情的守卫着，美国参议院里那种造谣中伤改变不了革命；阿谀逢迎的态度改变不了革命；用威胁和美洲国家外长会议等恐吓手段也同样改变不了革命。（附图片）
