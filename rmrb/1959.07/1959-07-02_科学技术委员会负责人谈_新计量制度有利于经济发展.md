Unified Measurement System Benefits Economic Development
Key Points of the Unified Measurement System
I. Retain the Market System; II. Abolish the Imperial System; III. Gradually Eliminate Miscellaneous Systems; IV. Unify the Chinese Names of Metric Units.

Xinhua News Agency, July 1st – A负责人 of the Science and Technology Commission gave an interview to Xinhua News Agency reporters regarding the State Council's order on unifying China's measurement system.

The负责人 of the Science and Technology Commission said: This is a major event in China's economic construction and people's lives. The development of modern measurement work must be based on the development of the national economy, especially industrial production and scientific and technological development. The development of production and science and technology is the decisive factor in promoting measurement work, but the development of production and science and technology cannot be separated from measurement. Accurate measurement can ensure the normal progress of production, improve labor efficiency; ensure product quality, maintain production safety and promote close cooperation between various production departments, production departments and circulation departments; and promote the development of science and technology. Therefore, measurement work has become one of the scales for measuring the level of economic and scientific and technological development of a country. The unification of a country's measurement system is an important condition for ensuring that measurement work can better serve the national economy. Old China's economy was very backward, its industry was underdeveloped, and the country's economic lifeline was controlled by various imperialists. Various foreign measurement systems also entered China with the invasion of this economic force. At that time, in addition to the international metric system (i.e., the metric system, referred to as the metric system), a large number of imperial and Japanese measurement units were also used. At the same time, various old miscellaneous systems left over from feudal society were also preserved, which formed a very chaotic situation with multiple systems being used at the same time. Measurement work could not be developed, and there was no way to talk about the unification of the measurement system. After liberation, with the recovery and development of China's national economy, especially the development of China's industry, transportation, and science and technology, with the strong help of the Soviet Union, China's measurement work has made great progress, and the unification of the measurement system is also being actively carried out. During the first five-year plan, various industrial departments gradually established various measurement organizations, trained a large number of measurement personnel, equipped them with various precision measurement standard instruments, and carried out the verification and management of various measuring instruments used in industry. Many scientific research units have also carried out a lot of high-level and emerging technology measurement work. In 1955, China established the National Bureau of Metrology to guide the development of measurement work in various departments and regions, and, with the help of the Soviet Union, carried out the establishment of national measurement benchmarks. Measurement work in various regions has also developed greatly. Up to now, local measurement agencies have developed to nearly six hundred. Twenty provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions), more than one hundred and fifty special zones (cities), and nearly four hundred counties have established measurement agencies. These agencies have approximately three thousand measurement personnel. As for the professional measurement personnel in enterprises and scientific research institutions, there are even more, and with the development of China's production and scientific undertakings, the professional team of measurement work will also have greater development.

    Unifying the National Measurement System
      Already Has Good Conditions
Because the international metric system is the most advanced and most commonly used measurement system in the world, it uses a decimal system, is simple to use, and can meet the requirements of modern scientific and technological development. Therefore, in the process of great development of national measurement work, the government has paid attention to the widespread adoption of the international metric system to gradually unify China's measurement system. In large-scale enterprises established by the Soviet Union to help China, the international metric system has been adopted in all aspects from blueprint design, technical equipment, and measuring instruments. China's self-built enterprises and the technical transformation of existing enterprises also promote the metric system. With the development of China's state-owned commerce and the implementation of unified purchase and sales work, the market system based on the metric system has been universally promoted in commercial circulation and agricultural product distribution, and some old miscellaneous systems have been gradually abolished. Therefore, over the past ten years, with the continuous development of China's national economy, the international metric system has become China's basic measurement system. This has prepared good conditions for this unification of the national measurement system.

The负责人 of the Science and Technology Commission said: The government has repeatedly and carefully considered the decision to further unify China's measurement system with the international metric system, and has widely solicited and adopted the opinions of the masses. Therefore, in terms of the content of implementation and the steps of promotion, the needs of China's national economic development are fully considered, and the usage habits of the vast masses are also appropriately taken care of. We believe that this decision will surely be warmly supported by the vast masses. The main points of this unification of the measurement system are: First, the market system is retained. This is because the market system was originally based on the metric system. For example, three 市尺 (shì chǐ, a Chinese unit of length) equals one meter, and two 市斤 (shì jīn, a Chinese unit of weight) equals one kilogram. The vast majority of the Chinese people are already accustomed to using this market system, and it is mainly only used in agriculture and related commercial activities. Retaining it has no adverse effects on the development of industry and modern science and technology, as well as the entire national economy, so this regulation is also appropriate. However, in the market system, some areas have already used ten 两 (liǎng, a Chinese unit of weight) as one 市斤, but most areas still use sixteen 两 as one 市斤. The calculation of hexadecimal is troublesome, and the masses demand to change to a ten 两 system. This requirement is reasonable. Therefore, the State Council decided that except in Chinese medicine, in order to prevent errors in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, the measurement unit of sixteen 两 per 斤 can continue to be used. It is required that all localities should uniformly change the sixteen 两 system to the ten 两 system within this year. Second, the imperial system is abolished, and the imperial system is changed to the metric system. However, in order to make full use of some imperial equipment that is still available, and for the needs of certain international trade, the imperial system can still be used in special circumstances. Third, miscellaneous systems will be gradually eliminated. Fourth, the Chinese names of metric units will be unified. In the past, China was very inconsistent in the Chinese names of metric units. The same metric unit has several different names. For example, the length measurement unit "米" (mǐ, meter) is also called "公尺" (gōng chǐ, metric foot) and "米突" (mǐ tú, meter). The weight (mass) measurement unit "公斤" (gōng jīn, kilogram) is also called "千克" (qiān kè, kilogram) and "启罗克兰姆" (qǐ luó kè lán mǔ, kilogram), etc. This situation has brought a lot of difficulties to industrial production and the vast masses of people, increased many unnecessary troubles, and even easily caused errors and losses. The vast masses of people urgently demand to change this situation. Before liberation, people from all walks of life put forward various suggestions for unifying the names of measurement units in China, and there had been long-term debates, which failed to reach a consensus. After liberation, in order to unify the Chinese names of metric units, many discussions were organized, and now the opinions of all parties are basically the same. In the long-term practice of use, the vast masses of people have made some choices for the names of the most commonly used measurement units, showing a unified trend. Based on the experience of the masses in use, and based on the scientific nature of the names of measurement units, we have drafted the current unified Chinese name scheme for length, weight (mass), and capacity measurement units (in the scheme, the length unit "公里" (gōng lǐ, kilometer) is generally used to calculate routes and distances, and "千米" (qiān mǐ, kilometer) is used to calculate the length of objects, so this unit has two names, while the rest only use one name). This plan has been discussed many times with relevant departments before reporting to the State Council. The opinions of experts from engineering and technical circles, science circles, and business circles have been solicited. A consensus was reached. The new plan is based on the plan proposed by the Chinese Physical Society, with necessary adjustments. This plan clearly expresses the characteristics of the international metric system's decimal system, and has absorbed the experience of the vast masses of people in long-term use. Therefore, it not only meets the strict requirements of measurement science, but also can adapt to the habits of the vast masses of people. This plan includes basic measurement units. The Chinese names of measurement units for other physical quantities will be jointly studied by the National Bureau of Metrology and relevant departments according to the order of the State Council, and a unified plan will be submitted for approval and promulgation by the Science and Technology Commission.

The负责人 of the Science and Technology Commission said: After the promulgation of the international metric system as China's basic measurement system and the determination of unified Chinese names for metric units, a lot of work still needs to be done, and attention should be paid to taking active and steady steps when carrying out reforms. For some remote areas and ethnic minority areas, in order to take care of the habits of the masses and avoid affecting market transactions, steady steps should be taken to gradually eliminate old miscellaneous systems. When reforming the market system from sixteen 两 per 市斤 to ten 两 per 市斤, the original steelyard balances, platform scales, etc. should be used for modification to save manpower, materials, and prevent waste. Various industrial transportation, scientific research departments, schools, and book publications should do a good job of publicity and explanation.
        Strengthen Measurement Management Work to Better Serve Production
The负责人 of the Science and Technology Commission finally said: In order to ensure that the international metric system, this basic measurement system, and unified Chinese names can play a practical role in production and construction and people's lives, it is necessary to ensure that the metric measuring instruments can be consistent, accurate, and correctly used. Therefore, the measurement management work of various departments and regions must be strengthened. It is recommended that various regions put the measurement management agencies under the leadership of the local science and technology committees so that measurement can better serve industry, agriculture, commerce, and the entire national economy. Various regions should also establish and improve measurement institutions based on the specific conditions of the region. Under the overall planning of the state, strengthen the verification work of the measuring instruments that should be verified in the所属地区, so as to form China's complete measurement network. Ensure the consistency, accuracy, and correct use of measuring instruments nationwide.

Measurement work must ensure that under the leadership of the Party, the mass line is implemented, focusing on serving industry, serving production, and implementing the principle of combining popularization and improvement, so as to better play a greater role in China's socialist construction.

    科学技术委员会负责人谈
    新计量制度有利于经济发展
    统一计量制度的要点
    一、保留市制；二、废除英制；三；逐步淘汰杂制；四、统一公制计量单位的中文名称。
    新华社1日讯　科学技术委员会负责人就国务院发布关于统一我国计量制度的命令向新华社记者发表谈话。
    科学技术委员会的负责人说：这是我国经济建设和人民生活中的一件大事。现代计量工作的发展，要建立在国民经济发展、特别是工业生产和科学技术发展的基础上。生产和科学技术的发展是推动计量工作的决定因素，但生产和科学技术的发展又不能离开计量，准确的计量能够保证生产的正常进行，提高劳动效率；保证产品质量，维护生产安全和促进各生产部门之间、生产部门和流通部门之间的密切配合；能够促进科学技术的发展。因此，计量工作成为衡量一个国家经济和科学技术发展水平的尺度之一。而一个国家计量制度的统一，又是保证计量工作能够更好地发挥为国民经济服务的作用的重要条件。旧中国经济十分落后，工业不发达，国家经济命脉操纵在各个帝国主义手里，国外的各种不同的计量制度也就随着这种经济势力的侵略而进入我国。当时，除了国际公制（即米突制，简称公制）以外，还大量地使用英制、日制等计量单位，同时，封建社会遗留下来的各种旧杂制也还保存着，这样更形成多制并用的十分混乱局面，计量工作得不到发展，也根本谈不上计量制度的统一。解放后，随着我国国民经济的恢复和发展，特别是我国工业交通和科学技术事业的发展，在苏联的大力帮助下，我国计量工作有了很大的发展，计量制度的统一工作也在积极地进行。各工业部门在第一个五年计划期间逐步建立了各种计量组织，训练了大批计量人员，配备了各种精密的计量标准仪器，开展了工业上使用的各种计量器具的检定管理工作。许多科学试验研究单位也进行很多高级的和新兴技术方面的计量工作。在1955年，我国成立了国家计量局，指导各部门、各地区计量工作的开展，并在苏联的帮助下，进行建立国家计量基准工作。各地区的计量工作也有很大发展。到目前为止，地方计量机构已发展到近六百个。全国已有二十个省（市、自治区），一百五十多个专区（市），近四百个县都建立了计量机构。这些机构共有计量人员约三千人。至于企业和科学研究机构的专业计量人员就更多了，而且随着我国生产和科学事业的发展，计量工作的专业队伍也将有更大的发展。
    统一全国计量制度
      已经具备良好条件
    由于国际公制是世界上最先进最通用的计量制度，十进十退，使用简便，能够适应近代科学技术发展的要求，因此，在全国计量工作的大发展过程中，政府即注意了广泛采用国际公制，来逐步地统一我国计量制度。由苏联帮助我国建立的大型企业中，从图纸设计、技术装备、计量器具等各个方面一律采用了国际公制；我国自建的各种企业以及对原有企业的技术改造，也推行公制；随着我国国营商业的发展，以及统购统销工作的实行，商业流通和农产品分配等方面，普遍推行了以公制为基础的市制，逐步废除了一些旧杂制。因此，十年来随着我国国民经济的不断发展，国际公制已形成为我国的基本计量制度。这就给这一次统一全国的计量制度准备了良好条件。
    科学技术委员会负责人说：政府在这次决定以国际公制进一步统一我国计量制度以前，是经过反复地、慎重地考虑，并广泛地征求和采纳群众的意见的。因此，在实施的内容上，推行的步骤上，充分地考虑我国国民经济发展的需要，也适当照顾广大群众的使用习惯。我们相信，这一决定必将受到广大群众的热烈拥护。这次统一计量制度的要点是：第一，保留市制，这是因为市制原来就是以公制为基础的，例如三市尺等于一米，二市斤等于一公斤，这种市制我国广大人民已经习惯使用，而且主要是仅仅通用在农业及与其相关的商业活动中。保留它，对于工业和近代科学技术以及整个国民经济的发展，并无不良影响，因此这样规定也是适宜的，不过，在市制中目前有些地区已以十两为一市斤，但大部分地区仍沿用十六两为一市斤。十六进位的计算麻烦，群众要求改为十两制，这个要求是合理的。因此，国务院决定除了在中药方面为了防止中医处方用药的差错，还可以继续使用十六两为一斤的计量单位外，要求各地在今年内应一律将十六两制改为十两制。第二，废除英制，改英制为公制。但是，为了充分利用现在尚可利用的一些英制设备，以及为了某些国际贸易上的需要，在特殊的情况下，仍可使用英制。第三，逐步淘汰杂制。第四，统一公制计量单位的中文名称。过去我国在使用公制计量单位的中文名称上很不统一，同样一个公制计量单位，却有几种不同的名称。例如，长度计量单位中的“米”又叫“公尺”，还叫“米突”。重量（质量同）计量单位中的“公斤”又叫“千克”，还叫“启罗克兰姆”等等。这种情况，给工业生产和广大人民带来了不少的困难，增加了许多不必要的麻烦，甚至容易造成错误和损失。广大人民群众迫切要求改变这种状况。解放前，各界人士曾提出过各种统一我国计量单位名称的建议方案，有过长期的争论，未能一致。解放以后，为了统一公制计量单位的中文名称，曾组织过多次的讨论，现在各方面的意见已基本一致。广大群众在长期的使用实践中，对最常用的一些计量单位名称已有所选择，表现了统一的趋势。我们根据群众使用的经验，本着计量单位名称应有的科学性，拟订了现在这个统一的长度、重量（质量同）、容量计量单位的中文名称方案（方案中，长度单位的“公里”一般习惯用于计算路程和距离，“千米”用于计算物体长短，因此这一单位有两个名称外，其余都只用一个名称）。这个方案在报国务院之前曾多次和各有关部门商洽。征求了工程技术界、科学界、商业界等各方面专家的意见。取得了一致的认识。新方案是以中国物理学会提出的方案为基础，加以必要的调整拟成的。这个方案比较明确地表现了国际公制十进十退的特点，并且在吸收了广大人民群众在长期使用中的经验。因此，是既符合计量科学的严格要求，又能够适应广大群众的习惯的。这个方案包括了基本的计量单位，其他物理量的计量单位中文名称，根据国务院命令将由国家计量局与有关部门共同研究提出统一方案，经科学技术委员会批准公布。
    科学技术委员会负责人说：公布了以国际公制作为我国的基本计量制度和确定了统一的公制计量单位中文名称后，还需要作不少的工作，而且在进行改革的时候要注意采取积极而稳妥的步骤。对于某些偏僻地区和少数民族地区，为了照顾群众的习惯和避免影响市场的交易，在淘汰旧杂制时要采取逐步的稳妥的步骤；对于改革市制中十六两一市斤为十两一市斤时，应该利用原来的杆秤、台秤等加以改制，以节约人力、物力，防止浪费；各工业交通、科学研究部门、学校、以及书刊出版等要做好宣传解释工作。
        加强计量管理工作更好地为生产服务
    科学技术委员会负责人最后说：为了使国际公制这个基本计量制度和统一的中文名称能在生产建设、人民生活中起实际的作用，必须保证公制的计量器具能够一致、准确和正确使用。因此，各个部门、各个地区的计量管理的工作必须加强。建议各地区将计量管理机构归由地方的科学技术委员会领导，以便计量能更好地为工农业、商业以及整个国民经济服务。各地区还应根据本地区具体条件，建立与健全计量机构。在国家的统筹规划下，加强对所属地区应受检定的计量器具的检定工作，以组成我国完整的计量网。保证全国计量器具的一致、准确和正确使用。
    计量工作必须保证在党的领导下，贯彻群众路线，为工业服务为重点，为生产服务，和执行普及和提高相结合的方针，以便更好地在我国社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用。（附图片）
