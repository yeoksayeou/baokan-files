Yangxin County in Hubei Province is actively creating and promoting ramie scutching machines.

Ramie is one of the main crops of Yangxin County, and the county's ramie planting area accounts for 29% of the total ramie area in the province. This year, the first harvest of ramie was abundant. Because the ramie production season is very strong, failure to harvest and scutch it in a timely manner will affect the growth of the next season's ramie. According to this year's ramie output, if the old-fashioned ramie knives are still used for scutching, the ramie scutching task cannot be completed in time. Therefore, under the leadership and support of the county party committee, the county commercial bureau, in conjunction with relevant departments, actively carried out tool reform work and created many kinds of ramie scutching machines. The county has decided to promote 50,000 sets of the 59-1 type hand-operated ramie scraping machine, 80,000 sets of three-nail type ramie scraping tools, and 20,000 sets of planing type ramie scraping tools this year. They also used the method of "first indigenous, then foreign," and based on manual ramie scutching, they researched and created many indigenous ramie scutching machines that are highly efficient, low in cost, small and lightweight, and easy to imitate.

Under the leadership of the county party committee, the county commercial bureau also held a county-wide on-site meeting on ramie tool reform, vigorously promoting the 59-1 type hand-operated ramie scraping machine. The county commercial bureau pre-manufactured sixty standard samples and distributed them to the management districts of various communes for imitation before the on-site meeting. At the same time, the commercial bureau also organized two working groups to go deep into key communes to provide technical guidance.

    阳新县积极推广打麻机
    本报讯　湖北阳新积极创制和推广打麻机。
    苎麻是阳新县主要农作物之一，全县苎麻种植面积占全省苎麻总面积的29％。今年，头麻丰收，由于苎麻生产季节性很强，不及时收打，就会影响下一季麻的生长。按今年苎麻产量，如果仍旧全部使用旧式麻刀打麻就不能及时完成打麻任务，因此，这个县商业局在县委的领导支持下，联合有关部门，积极地进行了工具改革工作，创造了许多种苎麻打麻机。全县确定在今年推广59—1型手压式刮麻机五万部，三钉式刮麻工具八万部，刨式刮麻工具两万部。他们还用先土后洋的办法，在手工打麻的基础上，研究创造了不少效率高、造价低、小巧轻便、容易仿制的打麻土机器。
    在县委的领导下，县商业局还召开全县打麻工具改革现场会议，大力推广了59—1型手压式刮麻机。县商业局预先制造出六十部标准样品，在现场会议以前就发给各公社管理区仿制；同时，商业局还组织了两个工作组，深入到重点公社进行技术指导。
