The Beacon of Greece
Liu Baiyu

We must solemnly warn the Greek authorities: Do not harm Glezos! Glezos's freedom must be restored!

Greece is a name we cherish in our hearts, because in ancient times, she illuminated humanity's path forward with the beacon of wisdom. No matter how long the dark rule is imposed upon the Greek people, the brilliance of Homer, Euripides, Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, and Phidias will not fade from people's hearts. And today, as new waves of aggression continue to冲击 Greece, the fearless, heroic Greece stands tall. Glezos, through iron bars, once again raises high the beacon of Greece today, defending justice and defending peace.

May I ask: Who represents Greece? Who speaks for Greece? Is it George II and Paul I, who fled to London far away under the German fascist invasion? Is it the servile Karamanlis, who allows the United States to station its fleet in Crete, to store missiles in Souda and Sitia, to turn Greece into an atomic base, and to push the Greek people onto a powder keg that could explode at any time? Is it the American who received the Oak Leaf Cluster Silver Star for being stained with the blood of Greek martyrs and ran over former anti-German commander General Sarafis with a military vehicle? No, it is the Greek people, it is the son of the Greek people—Glezos. It is this man who looks at the world with loving eyes, it is this man who, when the black terror of German fascism came, climbed to the top of the Athens city wall, personally tore down the swastika flag and raised the Greek national flag high, it is this man who has been imprisoned twelve times and walked out of iron bars twelve times. It is this man who, today, in front of the people of the world—he strides forward, overcoming all imprisonment, torture, conspiracy, and framing. He is the "hero cast from head to toe in pure steel" that Herzen spoke of. His greatest significance lies in telling the world: "He who would be free, himself must strike the blow!" (See Byron's "Greece") He inherits the traditions of Greece, carries forward the spirit of Greece, and shines with the light of Greece. Engels said: "The ancient state was, above all, the state of the slave owners for suppressing the slaves" (see "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State"). Precisely because of this, the spirit of slave uprising and struggle soars under suppression. Plato described it this way: "They sit in the city, armed with white blades, some burdened with debt, some disgraced, some with both misfortunes and harboring resentment, intending to deal with those who took their property, even with everyone—they are planning to rebel." (See "The Republic") Glezos, who came from a poor family on the island of Naxos, is filled with this rebellious blood in his veins, which is precisely what makes his life so valuable. This is precisely the noblest virtue that everyone standing at the forefront of the struggle to defend peace should possess. The reason he has such miraculous courage and invincible strength is just like Antaeus with his feet rooted in the earth, he is rooted in the angry people.

No matter how gloomy the clouds over the Mediterranean, no matter how turbulent the storms in the Aegean Sea, the true Greece, the Greece of the Greek people, the Greece of the people of the world, will never be a springboard for imperialist aggression, but will always be the outpost of the battle for peace, because the people who gave birth to Glezos will inevitably crush the wheels of the opposition.

The just voice of the Greek people has also been heard in distant China. The ocean and the land cannot cut off the road of connection between the people of the world. Here, I remember the ancient Greeks had a profound saying to friends: "May you have a safe journey, may you drink clear springs," and today's clear springs are the friendship in the hearts of the people all over the world. This friendship is currently being transformed into the power to defend the beacon of Greece. From Europe to Asia, from America to Africa, people are issuing a united call to support Glezos. This call is now getting louder and louder, stronger and stronger, and it has become a storm of truth and justice. We believe that in the face of such a storm, the beacon of Greece will shine even brighter.

    希腊的明灯
    刘白羽
    我们要郑重地警告希腊当局：不准伤害格列索斯！必须恢复格列索斯的自由！
    希腊，是我们心中所钟爱的名字，因为在古老的年代里，她就以智慧的明灯，为人类照明过前进的道路。不论黑暗的统治强加于希腊人民头上时间多么长久，但是，荷马，欧里庇第斯，亚理斯多芬，柏拉图，亚理士多德，斐狄亚斯的光辉，是不会从人们心中泯灭的。而在今天，当新的侵略浪潮不断向希腊冲击时，无畏的，英雄的希腊挺起了胸脯，格列索斯透过铁窗，又高高举起了保卫正义，保卫和平的，今日的希腊明灯。
    请问：是谁代表希腊？是谁发出希腊的声音？难道是在德国法西斯侵略下，远远逃亡伦敦的乔治二世、保罗一世们吗？难道是奴颜婢膝，任由美国把舰队驻扎在克里特岛，要把导弹储存在苏达和锡提亚，把希腊变为原子基地，把希腊人民推上随时可能爆炸的火药库的卡拉曼利斯们吗？难道是由于沾满希腊烈士鲜血而获得橡叶丛银星章、用军用汽车把前抗德军总司令萨拉非斯将军撞死的美国人吗？不，是希腊人民，是希腊人民的儿子——格列索斯。是用爱的眼光看着世界的这个人，是在德国法西斯黑色恐怖来临时，爬上雅典城头，亲手把卐字旗扯掉而把希腊民族旗帜高高升起的这个人，是十二次关进铁窗，又十二次走出铁窗的这个人。是这个人，在今天，在全世界人民面前，——是他踏过一切监禁，毒刑，阴谋，陷害，而昂首前进。他是赫尔岑所说的“从头到脚都用纯钢铸成的英雄”，他最伟大的意义在于告诉全世界：“谁要想获得自由，必须自己起来斗争！”（见拜伦的“希腊”）他承继着希腊的传统，发扬着希腊的精神，闪烁着希腊的光明。恩格斯说：“古代的国家，首先就是奴隶所有者用以镇压奴隶的国家”（见“家庭、私有制和国家的起源”）正因为如此，在镇压下昂扬着的是奴隶起义斗争的精神。关于这，柏拉图这样描叙过：“他们坐在城里，身怀白刃，有些负债累累，有些丧失体面，有些兼有此两种不幸而怀着愤恨，打算对付夺去他们财产的人、甚至对付所有的人，——他们在打算起义”。（见“共和国”）从纳克索斯岛一个贫苦家庭里来的格列索斯，血管里充满的正是这种反抗的血液，这正是他的生命可贵之处。这正是一切站在保卫和平斗争前线的人，应该具有的最高贵的品德。他所以有这样神奇的勇敢，不败的力量，正如同安泰两脚生根在大地上，他生根在愤怒的人民之中。
    不管地中海的乌云多阴沉，爱琴海的风暴多汹涌，但真正的希腊，希腊人民的希腊，全世界人民的希腊，它永远不会是帝国主义侵略的跳板，而永远是和平战斗的前哨，因为诞生了格列索斯的人民，必然会粉碎反对派的车轮。
    希腊人民正义的喊声，在遥远的中国也听到了。海洋和陆地都不能隔断全世界人民联系的路程。在这儿，我记起古希腊对朋友有这样一句意味深长的话：“愿君一路平安，愿君得饮清泉”，而今日的清泉，便是遍布全世界人民心中的友情。这种友情目前正在化为保卫希腊明灯的力量。从欧洲到亚洲，从美洲到非洲，人们发出一致的呼声来支援格列索斯。这呼声，现在愈来愈响亮，愈来愈强烈，它已成为真理与正义的风暴。我们相信，在这样的风暴面前，希腊的明灯将更加明亮。
