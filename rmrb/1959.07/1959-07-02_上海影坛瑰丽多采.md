The birthplace of Chinese film—Shanghai—has six color art films simultaneously in production in the first half of this year. These six color films are: "Nie Er," "Spring is Full of the World," "Lotus Lamp," "The Story of the Huangpu River," "Steel World," and "Urumqi—Shanghai." The content of these films is equally rich and diverse, including epic and moving stories reflecting the great leap forward last year, biographical accounts, depictions of the lives of ethnic minorities, and China's first national dance drama film. Here are some scenes from the filming process of three of these films.

Nie Er's Comrades Film "Nie Er"

The angry waves of the Huangpu River crashed against the ocean liners docked at the riverbank. A group of ragged coolies, unable to endure the oppression of foreigners and foremen, roared in protest. Old Wang, a dockworker, held his grandson, who had been beaten to death by a foreman, and joined the workers armed with shovels and carrying poles to demonstrate against the enemy:

"We are not afraid of death!
Don't try to scare us with death!
We will not be slaves of a conquered nation,
We want to be masters of China...!"

This is a scene from the famous opera "Storm on the Yangtze River," which premiered in Shanghai in 1934. The people's musician Nie Er was the composer and director of this opera and personally played the role of Old Wang. Twenty-five years later, this scene was staged again in the Shanghai Haiyan Film Studio's soundstage. This is a scene from the biographical film "Nie Er," in which Zhao Dan, a famous actor who performed on stage with the people's musician back then, plays Nie Er.

On the eve of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the young Nie Er, under the leadership of the Party, used his talent and wisdom to compose many famous songs, arousing countless kind hearts to engage in the resistance against Japan. His short life shone with boundless brilliance. Nie Er died tragically in Japan's Kugenuma while on his way to study in the Soviet Union at the age of twenty-four.

The screenwriter, director, main actors, and production crew of this film are mostly good friends of Nie Er during his lifetime. The screenwriter, Yu Ling, was the leader of Nie Er's Party organization at the time. Zheng Junli, an old director who had worked with Nie Er, directed the film and participated in the screenwriting work along with the musician Meng Bo. The film is now nearly half completed, and famous actors such as Zhang Ruifang and Huang Zongying have also participated in the filming of "Nie Er."

Bai Yang's New Subject

In the No. 2 soundstage of the Tianma Film Studio, the color feature film "Spring is Full of the World" is filming a scene of an expert consultation meeting. Party Secretary Fang Qun sits among a group of experts and doctors in white coats, intently listening to and pondering their opinions.

The actress playing Party Secretary Fang Qun is the famous film actress Bai Yang. She has previously portrayed the image of a virtuous wife, a loving mother, and a kind oppressed woman on the screen, but playing a Party Secretary is a first for her.

"How do you shape this role?" we asked while she was resting.

"This is difficult for me to answer because shaping the image of a noble Communist Party leader is a new subject for me. I feel like a freshman just entering school, both fresh and unfamiliar." She replied with a smile.

She said, "When playing the role of a Party Secretary, one often expresses strength of will and principles, but unconsciously neglects to reveal the rich spiritual world of such a Party member from a moral, aesthetic, and psychological perspective... Therefore, it always leaves people feeling unsatisfied."

Fang Qun, an experienced Party worker, is young but sensitive to new things under the Party's guidance. In the event of saving the steelworker Ding Dagang from burns, she dared to think and act, was firm and decisive, and was good at relying on the masses. Finally, she made the advanced medical thought of the working class a victory, saving Ding Dagang's life. Fang Qun not only embodies the characteristics of a Communist Party member, but we should also see the personality of an emotional person. Therefore, I am considering that if the portrayal of Fang Qun, the Party Secretary, lacks emotional color, then the characterization will lose the main things. To make this character come alive, there are still many problems that need to be explored by the screenwriter, director, actors, and personnel from various departments. As an actor in the play, I am working with everyone to shape the image of each character in the whole play, constantly exploring and unfolding this new lesson to create a non-conceptualized Party Secretary...

The First Color Dance Drama Film

China's first color national dance drama film "Lotus Lamp" has been completed. In the screening room of Tianma Factory, experts, directors, and photographers are watching the rough cut to prepare for the final processing.

Zhao Qing, the daughter of the famous film actor Zhao Dan, plays the role of the Third Holy Mother in the play. The father and daughter are shooting two films at the same time. The forty-five-year-old father plays the twenty-something musician Nie Er, while the twenty-one-year-old daughter plays a mother, which is considered a good story in the film industry.

"Lotus Lamp" is an ancient and beautiful legend that describes the story of the joys and sorrows of the heavenly maiden the Third Holy Mother and the scholar Liu Yanchang between gods and humans, praising pure and beautiful love.

"A Hundred Days of Grief and Separation" is the most exciting scene in the film. When Chen Xiang is a hundred days old, relatives and neighbors come to celebrate, and the whole family is happy. To thank the guests for their kindness, the hosts also dance an affectionate silk dance. Each dance move tells the story of beautiful love and happy life.

The joyful dance is in full swing when suddenly the sky turns dark, the lights go out, sand and rocks fly, and wind, rain, thunder, and lightning come together, and the music also turns from joy to sorrow. The "Lotus Lamp" is stolen by the Howling Celestial Dog. The Third Holy Mother knows that something has happened and comes out with a sword and armor, but it is already too late. Erlang Shen leads the Howling Celestial Dog and the heavenly soldiers to descend from the sky. In an instant, a tense and fierce battle unfolds on the screen. The entire dance drama has no singing or dialogue except for concise and poetic narration. The young dance drama actors successfully used various knife and gun styles and graceful postures in Chinese classical dance to express the plot of the story and the characters' personalities.

### 上海影坛瑰丽多采

    上海影坛瑰丽多采
    中国电影的发源地——上海，今年上半年有六部彩色艺术片同时开拍。这六部彩色影片是：“聂耳”、“春满人间”、“宝莲灯”、“黄浦江的故事”、“钢铁世界”、“乌鲁木齐——上海”。这些影片的内容同样丰富多彩，有反映去年大跃进中史诗般的动人故事，有人物传记，有描写少数民族生活的，也有我国第一部民族舞剧片等。这里介绍的是三部影片在拍摄过程中的几个镜头。
    聂耳的战友拍“聂耳”
    黄浦江的怒涛冲击着停在江边的大洋船，一群衣衫褴褛的苦力不堪忍受洋人和把头的压迫，咆哮起来了。愤怒的码头工人老王抱着被把头打死的孙儿，和拿着铁锹、扁担的工人们一起来向敌人示威：
    “我们并不怕死！
    不用拿死来吓我们！
    我们不做亡国奴，
    我们要做中国的主人……。”
    这是1934年在上海上演的著名歌剧“扬子江暴风雨”的一个片断，人民音乐家聂耳是这个歌剧的作曲者和导演，并亲自扮演了老王一角。二十五年以后的今天，上海海燕电影制片厂的摄影棚里，又演出了这个场面，这是传记片“聂耳”的一个镜头，当年与这位人民音乐家同台演出的著名演员赵丹扮演了聂耳。
    抗战前夕，年轻的聂耳在党的领导下，以他的天才和智慧，创作了许多著名歌曲，唤起了无数善良的心去从事抗日。使他短暂的一生，发射出无限光芒。聂耳二十四岁赴苏留学途中不幸死于日本鹄沼海。
    这部电影的编剧、导演、主要演员和摄制人员，大部分是聂耳生前的好友。编剧于伶是当年聂耳所在党组织的领导人。曾和聂耳合作过的老导演郑君里担任了这部影片的导演，并和音乐家孟波一道参加了编剧工作。现在这部影片已经拍摄了将近一半，著名演员张瑞芳和黄宗英等也都参加了“聂耳”的拍摄。
    白杨的新课题
    天马电影制片厂的二号摄影棚，彩色故事片“春满人间”正在拍摄专家会诊会议的镜头，党委书记方群坐在一群身着白衣的专家和医生中间，聚精会神地倾听着思索着他们的意见。
    饰演党委书记方群的，是著名电影演员白杨。她过去在银幕上曾经出色地塑造了贤慧的妻子、慈祥的母亲和善良的被压迫妇女的形象，但表演党委书记还是第一次。
    “你是怎样塑造这个角色的呢？”乘她休息的时候，我们问。
  “这就叫我很难回答了，因为塑造一个崇高的共产党员领导干部的形象，对我来说，还是新的课题，我像是刚入校门的一年级学生，既感新鲜，而又陌生”。她笑着回答说。
    她说：“扮演党委书记这样的角色，常常会表现意志坚强、有原则，可是不知不觉又忽略从道德上，美感上，心理上……来揭示这样的党员的丰富的精神世界，因此看起来总使人不满足。”
    方群，一个有经验的党的工作者，虽然年青，但在党的培养下，对新事物敏感，在挽救烫伤的钢铁工人丁大刚事件上，敢想敢做，坚强果断，善于依靠群众，终于使先进的工人阶级医疗思想取得胜利，挽救了丁大刚的生命。在方群身上，不仅体现出共产党员所具备的特点。而且，也应该看到了一个富有情感的人的个性，因此我在考虑，方群这个党委书记，假若很缺乏感情色彩的描绘，那么在人物塑造上将会失掉主要的东西。要把这个人物塑造得活起来，这里面还有许多问题有待编剧、导演、演员以及各部门的人员共同来探索。我作为戏里一个演员，正跟大家在一起，为塑造全剧中各个人物形象工作着，为塑造一个不概念化的党委书记，进行不断的探索，展开这新的一课……
    第一部彩色舞剧片
    我国第一部彩色民族舞剧片“宝莲灯”已经拍完了。在天马厂的放映间里，专家、导演、摄影师们正在观看毛片，准备作最后的加工。
    著名电影演员赵丹的女儿赵青主演剧中的三圣母。他们父女俩同时在拍两部片子。四十五岁的父亲扮演了二十几岁的音乐家聂耳，二十一岁的女儿却扮演了母亲，被引为影坛佳话。
    “宝莲灯”是个古老而优美的传说，描述天仙三圣母和书生刘彦昌人神之间悲欢离合的故事，歌颂了纯洁美丽的爱情。
    “百日悲离”是影片中最精彩的一场。沉香降生百日，乡亲邻里相牵前来祝贺，举家欢乐。为答谢客人们的盛情，主人也双双跳起抒情的绸舞。每一个舞姿都诉说着美丽的爱情和幸福的生活。
    欢舞方酣，突然天昏地暗，灯火失明，飞砂走石，风雨雷电交加，音乐也由喜而悲。“宝莲灯”被哮天犬盗走了。三圣母情知有变，持剑戎装而出，可是已经晚了。二郎神率哮天犬和众天兵自天而降。顷刻，银幕上展开了一场紧张激烈的战斗。整个舞剧除了简洁而富有诗意的旁白之外，没有一句唱词说白。年青的舞剧演员们成功地运用了中国古典舞蹈中各种刀枪式子和优美的身段来表达故事的情节和人物的性格。
