    Where is the Charm of Art?
    ——A Casual Talk on Listening to Hongxiannv's Singing
    Li Ling
    Seeing Hongxiannv's musical creations in the play "Guan Hanqing" has aroused many thoughts in me.
    Her attainments in the art of singing have reached a considerable height. It can be said that she has spanned the singing history of Cantonese opera Dan roles for two or three decades, placing the vocal art level of Cantonese opera on a new peak. Yet, she is still constantly conscientious, making many deliberations, and striving to build the newly created peak even higher.
    Many people know that her "singing voice is mellow" and she is known for having a "dragon head and phoenix tail" (meaning her combination of true and false voices is very good). This only describes her singing voice as being naturally endowed and very good. It has not yet touched upon the most valuable essence of her singing art.
    Having a voice, and a "dragon head and phoenix tail" at that, is naturally precious. There is no shortage of opera actors with beautiful singing voices, and there are also many new vocal workers with loud voices, who often win applause from the audience with some high and sustained notes. However, many people prefer to listen to singing like that of Zhao Yanxia, whose voice may not be particularly loud, but whose emotions are sincere and whose handling is delicate, "moving people's hearts."
    A few years ago, some vocalists who adopted Western singing methods tended to pursue only the grandeur of the voice, while neglecting the expression of the song's deep meaning (this has improved greatly in recent years). This situation is just like what is said in Cantonese, "dak ba seng" (meaning only a good voice). Bai Juyi sighed about this kind of singing in his time: "Ancient people sang songs with emotion, but today people only sing for the voice." This easily turns the art they want to express into a loud but empty sound.
    Hongxiannv's singing voice is naturally very good. However, in the play "Guan Hanqing," in ""Liangzhou Ci,"" ""Dou E's Complaint,"" ""Butterfly Lovers,"" and the final scene's ""Drunken in the East Wind,"" the reason why her singing voice captivates all the audience as if seized by an irresistible charm, making people "find it hard to calm down even after the whole night," is definitely not achieved by simply relying on the loudness of the voice.
    In the song "Butterfly Lovers," she is so deeply immersed that she pushes aside all the common unnecessary constraints of opera conventions and directly plunges into the depths of the drama's truth. When singing "We and you, hair may not be the same color but hearts are equally warm, born on different beds but will die in the same tomb," if Guan Hanqing had not reminded her: "Life and death are not to be spoken of separately, sharing this heart for thousands of years," and awakened her from her deep sorrow, she would have been at a loss. At this moment, Zhu Lianxiu's (the role played by Hongxiannv) heart should bear how much sorrow and resentment, and Hongxiannv's singing voice contains such complex emotions.
    Hongxiannv has a very strong analytical ability in her singing art. Several of our soloists have heard her singing in "Beating the Gods and Filing a Complaint" and feel that her interpretation and analysis of the song are so meticulous, the arrangement of levels is so clear and appropriate, and the creation of the artistic conception is so profound, which is rare. Anyone who has heard her sing "Zhaojun Departs for the Frontier" would probably agree with this assertion. In "Butterfly Lovers," this analytical ability is exceptionally prominent. Every sentence's meaning, every section's emotion, is grasped relatively thoroughly and profoundly. Her singing voice contains tenderness, sorrow, gratitude, indignation, hesitation, determination…, becoming increasingly intense. Even without seeing her movements and expressions on stage, the infection of the mood she portrays is equally deeply rooted in the hearts of the audience.
    Having a voice, having true feelings, and having the analytical ability of the voice, sometimes the charm of the singing is also affected if the selection of songs is not appropriate. It should be said that Hongxiannv is very particular about song selection and has a spirit of innovation. There are many tunes in Cantonese opera that can naturally express the plots they want to portray. For example, her "Zhaojun Departs for the Frontier" mostly chooses original tunes such as "Yi Fan Er Wang," "Yi Fan Zhong Ban," and "Er Liu" (but with reforms); at that time, the short tunes she added, such as "Cuckoo Cries" and "Border Ballad," were also mostly original short tunes or excerpts from old tunes. The several title songs in "Guan Hanqing," especially "Butterfly Lovers," focus on new tunes developed along the style of Cantonese folk songs and tunes, a bit like arias in Western opera. These independent tunes have initially achieved "music changes with emotions," sounding intimate and fresh.
    The solo in the last scene, the first few sentences, the night I listened, might have been a little scattered because the sound of the accompaniment music was too light and the twists and turns of the melody were too great. Other songs were very appropriate, like "Dou E's Complaint," "These officials are unintentionally unjust, making it difficult for the people to speak out," which evokes deep feelings of grief and anger; and like the final song, "Just saying take care, it breaks my heart to part," truly "every word is like a knife cutting the gut." This kind of attempt can also be said to be a method of creating new voices.
    Hongxiannv's vocal technique is quite accomplished, her range is very wide, and she uses it freely. This is also the result of hard training.
    Recently, I heard an actor who participated in the solo of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony say: "Although this symphony is about singing joy, when I sang, I had no joy at all. It was not until the lead singer finished singing that I felt a little more relaxed." This actor is indeed more serious about art, but because the technique of "Ode to Joy" (the fourth movement of the symphony) is very difficult, it often excludes some actors whose skills are not particularly proficient from the realm of emotion.
    Hongxiannv obviously solved the problems of vocal technique relatively well due to her early hard work and constant hard training, so that she can express joy, resentment, sorrow, happiness, urgency, slowness, tightness, relaxation, strength, weakness, lightness, and heaviness at will.
    Artistic creation cannot be determined by subjective wishes. Having a voice, having artistic pursuits, but lacking sufficient artistic skills will limit artistic expression to a very small range. Just as Yuan Zhen said in "Pipa Song": "The spirit is very good, but the skill is still shallow, and the urgency has not yet reached leisure."
    Therefore, "it is not okay to wear white gloves in artistic creation" should always be the best warning for our young artists.

    艺术的魅力在哪里？
    ——听红线女歌唱杂谈
    李凌
    看了红线女在“关汉卿”一剧中的音乐创造，引起我许多感想。
    她在歌唱艺术上的造诣，达到了相当高度，可以说是横断了粤剧旦角二三十年的歌唱历史，把粤剧声乐艺术水平放在一个新的顶峰，而她却还时刻地兢兢业业诸多推敲，在向前推积，企图把新创造的峰顶砌得更高。
    许多人都知道，她的“歌音圆润”、有“龙头凤尾”（即真假嗓音结合得很好）之称，这只是说她的歌喉，得天独厚，天赋很好而已。还没有接触到她那歌唱艺术最可贵的本质。
    有了声音，而且“龙头凤尾”，自然很宝贵。戏曲演员中歌喉优美的不乏人，新的声乐工作者中声音嘹亮的也不少，也常常在一些高长音中博得观众的喝彩。而往往有许多人宁愿听像赵燕侠那样声音虽不特别大，而情感真挚，处理细致，
  “动人肺腑”的歌唱。
    前几年有一些采取西洋方法歌唱的声乐家，就比较单单追求声音宏美，而忽略对歌曲深意的表现（这几年有很大的改进了）。这种情形，正像广东话所说的“得把声”（即只有一片好声音）。当年白居易就对这种唱歌慨叹过：“古人唱歌兼唱情，今人唱歌唯唱声”。这就容易把他所要表现的艺术，变成嘹亮而空洞的音响了。
    红线女的歌音自然很好，但是，在“关汉卿”剧中的”“凉州词”、
  “窦娥怨”、“蝶双飞”、以及最后一幕的“沉醉东风”，她的歌声所以使得所有的观众，好像被一种不可抗拒的魅力所摄住，使人“竟夕意难平”，决不是单纯依靠声音的嘹亮所能达到的。
    她在“蝶双飞”一曲中，沉迷得这样深，她推开一切常有的不必要的戏曲程式的约束，直截了当地投入戏剧真实的深处，唱到“俺与你，发不同青心同热，生不同床死同穴”处，如果不是关汉卿提醒她：“生死不言别，千秋共此心”，使她在深沉的忧伤中苏醒过来，她就不知所措了。此时此刻，朱廉秀（红线女扮演的角色）的心怀应该担当多少悲愁、愤恨，在红线女的歌声里就蕴藏着这样的复杂的感情。
    红线女的歌唱的艺术分析力是很强的，我们有几位独唱演员，曾经听过她在“打神告庙”中的歌唱，觉得她的歌声的解释和分析那么细致，层次安排那么分明得体，意境的创造那么深刻是很少有的。听过她唱“昭君出塞”的人，恐怕也会同意这种论断。在“蝶双飞”中这种分析力表现得异常突出，每句词意，每段的情绪，都捉摸得比较透彻、深刻，她的歌声包含着柔情、悲切、感激、愤慨、犹豫、果敢……，越来越强烈，即使不看她在台上的动作表情，而她所刻划的心情的感染也一样深入听众的心怀。
    有了声音，有了真情，有了声音的分析力，如果选曲不恰当，有时也影响到歌唱的魅力。应该说，红线女在选曲上是很讲究的，并且带有革新的精神。粤剧中有许多唱腔，自然也能表达她们要刻划的情节，像她的“昭君出塞”，就多半是选“乙反二王”、“乙反中板”、“二流”等原有唱腔（但已有改革）；那时她加唱的小曲，像“子规啼”、“塞外吟”等，也多是原有小曲或从旧曲中切取一段，而“关汉卿”中的几首标题曲，特别是“蝶双飞”则偏重于沿着广东小曲与唱腔的曲风发展出来的新曲，有点像西洋歌剧中的咏叹调，这些能独立的曲腔，初步做到了“曲随情变”，听起来亲切而新鲜。
    最后一幕的一段独唱，前面几句，我听的那晚可能由于伴奏音乐的声音太轻，而曲调的转折又太大，听起来感到有点零散之外，其他几曲都非常恰当，像“窦娥怨”中的“这都是官吏无心正法，使百姓有口难言”，引起悲愤的感情是很深的；又像终曲：“刚道声保重将息，教人舍不得”，真是“一声肠一断”。这种尝试，也可以说是创新声的一法。
    红线女的声乐技巧相当到家，音域很广，运用自如，这也是刻苦锻炼的结果。
    最近我听到一位参加过贝多芬第九交响乐独唱的演员说：“这首交响乐虽然是歌唱欢乐，而我唱时，根本就没有欢乐，直到领唱唱完，心情才稍为舒畅一点”。这位演员对待艺术的确比较认真，但是由于“欢乐颂”（交响乐的第四章）的技巧非常困难，往往把一些工夫不是特别老当的演员排在情感的门外了。
    红线女显然由于早先下过许多苦功，而且经常不断的刻苦锻炼，把声音技巧上的问题，解决得比较好，才能喜、怨、哀、乐，急、缓、紧、弛，强、弱、轻、重随心所欲。
    艺术创造还不能由主观愿望所决定，有了声音，有了艺术追求，如果没有足够的艺术技巧，就会把艺术的表现局限在很小的范围。正像元稹在“琵琶歌”中所说的：“灵性甚好功犹浅，急处未得臻幽闲”。
    因之，“在艺术创造上带白手套是不行的”这句名言，时刻都应该是我们年青的艺术家的最好的警语。
