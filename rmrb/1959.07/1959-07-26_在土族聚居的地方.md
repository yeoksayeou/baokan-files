　　Many Avenues of Production
　　Walking into the only Tu Autonomous County in China—the Mutu Tu Autonomous County of Qinghai Province—one can hear the children's song: "The plains are fragrant with wheat, the slopes are yellow with highland barley, oilseed rape is planted on the mountains, and cattle and sheep graze on the mountaintops." This vividly depicts the scene in the Tu rural areas. Here, almost every production team has both plains, slopes, and mountains. The colors of different crops decorate the Tu mountains and rivers like a beautiful brocade.
　　In addition to draft animals, the county has more than 10,000 cattle, more than 150,000 sheep and goats. Milk products, meat, and fur are the Tu people's major source of income after agriculture. This is the area with the most pig farming in Qinghai Province, with an average of 1.6 pigs per household. Under the unified arrangement of the commune, Tu farmers also collectively and individually raise chickens, grow vegetables, hunt, and dig for medicinal herbs. Recently, new avenues of production such as beekeeping and rabbit breeding have been opened up.
　　Diversified operations have made production and life in the Tu rural areas very active. Before liberation, the rich mountains and rivers did not bring the Tu people enough food and clothing. They sang sadly: "Thin soup for food makes the body weak, sleeping on a hard kang makes the back ache…" Only after the Communist Party led them to overthrow feudal rule, organized collective production, and extracted wealth from the mountains, forests, and valleys did they gradually escape their former poverty.
　　Every Household Reads Aloud
　　Within the autonomous county, there are now 213 primary schools and 9 middle schools, with nearly 30,000 students. All school-age children are in school. When Tu farmers talk about the development of culture and education, they cannot help but say excitedly: "Now there are schools in every village, and the sound of reading can be heard in every household."
　　When the Tu areas were liberated in 1949, there were only more than 1,600 primary school students in the entire county, the vast majority of whom were children of landlords and rich peasants. There was not a decent school in the areas where the Tu people were concentrated. Almost all Tu farmers were illiterate. Occasionally, when they received a letter, they had to travel 20 or 30 li to find someone to read it.
　　In one Tu village—Wushi Village—no one was literate. Everyone felt very distressed. They once raised 50 jin of highland barley every month to hire someone to study in another place. Now, there is a school here that includes junior primary, senior primary, and junior high schools, with a total of more than 500 students. The growth of the school has received great help from the masses. During construction, everyone participated in voluntary labor, some sending wood and some sending adobe bricks. They eagerly hope that the younger generation will become cultured new people.
　　The cultural life of the entire village has also gradually become active. With the school as the core, spare-time cultural schools and agricultural schools have been established. The rural club has sorted out and compiled many ethnic songs and dances; the teachers and students of the school have also helped promote the rural sanitation and hygiene movement. This village is a microcosm of the Tu area.
　　Cultivating New Wheat Varieties
　　Yang Youcang, who had never attended school, developed a new wheat variety that is both high-yielding and adaptable through repeated painstaking research. This new variety uses the local "Ga Laohan" as the female parent and the high-yielding Biyu wheat as the male parent. After two generations of hybridization, the average number of grains per spike is 32% more than that of Biyu wheat. It is not only full of grains, but also disease-resistant, drought-resistant, tight-mouthed, and not easy to thresh.
　　Yang Youcang is a member of the Heerchuan Commune in the Mutu Tu Autonomous County and a member of the Communist Party. He found that although the Biyu wheat trial-planted locally had a high yield, it had the disadvantages of loose mouth, lodging, and easy infection with diseases, so he wondered how to obtain an excellent variety that was both high-yielding and adaptable to local natural conditions. When he learned the secret that crops, like donkeys and horses, "can produce mules through hybridization," he began the experiment. Unexpectedly, the seeds hybridized in the first year were frozen to death before they matured, and in the second year they were eaten by sparrows. It was not until the third year that he harvested 30 grains.
　　Can a perennial wheat variety be cultivated by hybridizing ice grass with wheat? Now, the first generation of seedlings of ice grass hybridized with wheat has appeared in Yang Youcang's experimental field. It looks very similar to wheat, but its leaves are narrower than wheat and have some characteristics of ice grass.
　　The Singing and Dancing Tu People
　　There are more than 60,000 Tu people in China, centered on the Mutu Tu Autonomous County in Qinghai Province, spanning the Qilian Mountains, and distributed in Datong, Ledu, Minhe, Tianzhu and other counties in Qinghai and Gansu provinces. Nearly 60,000 people are distributed in Qinghai Province, and more than 20,000 people live in Mutu County.
　　As early as the Northern Song and Yuan dynasties, the Mongols had marched west several times to the Yellow River and Huangshui River basins at the foot of the Qilian Mountains, staying and multiplying to form today's Tu people.
　　The Tu people love singing and dancing. However, the reactionary rulers of the past dynasties forbade them from performing their own songs and dances and from wearing their own ethnic costumes. Many excellent folk literary works were strangled into "fragmentary chapters" or even lost. After liberation, the Party continuously sent literary and art workers to visit and collect in the Tu areas, and sorted out and published a large number of oral literary creations. The Tu people also selected their own outstanding representatives to perform in Beijing several times, and were warmly welcomed.
　　Most of the legends, proverbs, and historical stories circulating among the Tu people are expressed through singing. Tu songs include "Hua'er," banquet songs, and festive songs. "Hua'er" is a kind of mountain song. Whether it is women weeding in the fields, children herding sheep on the hillsides, or old men driving carts, almost everyone can sing. Every year on the second day of the second lunar month and the sixth day of the sixth lunar month, "Hua'er" festivals are held in various places, with many singers competing against each other. The performers can all improvise lyrics based on the scene.

    在土族聚居的地方
  　生产门路多
    走进我国唯一的土族自治县——青海省互助土族自治县，就可以听到“平川小麦香，坡地青稞黄，山上种油菜，山顶放牛羊”的儿歌，它形象地描绘出了土族农村的景象。这里差不多每个生产队都兼有川地、坡地和山地，不同作物的颜色把土族山川点缀得如同锦绣。
    全县除耕畜以外，有牛一万多头，绵羊和山羊十五万多只，奶品、肉类和皮毛是土族人民次于农业的大收入。这里是青海省养猪最多的地区，平均每户有猪一点六头。土族农民还在公社统一安排下，集体和家庭并举地养鸡、种菜、打猎和挖药材。最近，又新辟了养蜂、养兔等生产门路。
    多种经营使得土族农村生产和生活十分活跃。解放以前，富饶的山川并没有给土族人民带来丰衣足食，他们愁苦地唱道：“稀汤当饭身子乏呀，精炕睡觉脊背酸呀……”，只有在共产党领导他们推翻了封建统治以后，组织集体生产，向山林河谷索取财富，他们才逐渐摆脱了往日的贫困。
    户户读书声
    在自治县境内，现有小学二百一十三所，初中九所，学生近三万人，适龄儿童全部进了学校。土族农民一谈到文化教育的发展，就不禁要激动地说：“现在真是村村有学校，户户读书声了。”
    当1949年土族地区解放时，全县只有小学生一千六百多人，绝大多数是地主富农的孩子。在土族集中的地区，没有一所像样的学校。土族农民几乎全是文盲，偶然接到一封信，要跑到二、三十里外去找人念。
    有一个土族聚居的农村——五十村，全村一个识字的人也没有，大家感到十分痛苦，曾经每月筹集五十斤青稞雇了一个人到外地去念书。现在，这里有了一所包括初小、高小和初中的学校，共有学生五百多人。学校的成长得到了群众很大的帮助。在修建中，大家参加义务劳动，有人送木料，有人送土坯。他们切望着年青一代成为有文化的新人。
    全村的文化生活也渐渐活跃起来。以学校为核心，办起了业余文化学校、农业学校，农村俱乐部整理和编演了许多民族歌舞；学校的师生还帮助推动了农村爱清洁、讲卫生运动。这个村子正是土族地区的一幅缩影。
    培育小麦新品种
    没有上过一天学的杨友苍，经过反复的刻苦钻研，育成一种既高产、适应性又强的小麦新品种。这个新品种以当地的“尕老汉”为母本，高产的碧玉麦为父本，杂交两代以后，每穗的平均籽粒比碧玉麦还多32％，不但颗粒饱满，而且抗病耐旱，口紧不易脱粒。
    杨友苍是互助土族自治县贺尔川公社社员，共产党员。他发现当地试种的碧玉麦产量虽然高，但是有口松、倒伏、容易感染病害的缺点，就想着如何得到一种产量既高、又能适应当地自然条件的优良品种。当他知道庄稼和驴、马一样，“杂交可以生骡”的奥秘以后，就开始了试验。不料，第一年杂交成的籽种不到成熟就冻死了，第二年又被麻雀吃光了，直到第三年才收获到三十粒。
    用冰草与小麦杂交能不能育成多年生的小麦呢？现在，冰草与小麦杂交第一代的苗稼已出现在杨友苍的试验地里了。它酷似小麦，但叶比小麦窄，并且具有冰草的一些特性。
    能歌善舞的土族
    我国土族共六万多人，以青海省互助土族自治县为中心，跨祁连山脉，分布在青海、甘肃两省的大通、乐都、民和、天祝等县。分布在青海省的将近六万人，聚居在互助县的有二万多人。
    远在北宋和元代，蒙古人曾经几次西进到祁连山麓的黄河、湟水流域，留居繁衍，形成今天的土族。
    土族人民酷爱歌舞。但历代反动统治者禁止他们演出自己的歌舞，不准他们穿自己民族的服装。许多优秀的民间文艺作品被扼杀成“断简残篇”，甚至失传。解放以后，党不断派遣文艺工作者深入土族地区访问搜集，整理出版了大量口头文艺创作。土族人民也选派自己的优秀代表几次到北京演出，受到了热烈欢迎。
    流传在土族民间的传说、谚语和历史故事，极大部分是用歌唱来表达的。土族歌曲包括“花儿”、宴席曲、喜曲等种。“花儿”是一种山歌。不论是田野里拔草的妇女，山坡上放羊的娃娃，赶车的老汉，几乎人人会唱。每年农历二月二、六月六，各地都举行“花儿会”，由许多唱家争相竞唱。演唱者都能触景生情，即兴编词。
