Location Shooting Notes on "Nameless Island"
    Fang Hui
    Our youth film crew from the Beijing Film Studio gloriously accepted the task of filming the movie "Nameless Island" and left the capital to come to the national defense line of the motherland. Here, we will live and work with the most beloved people. This is an unparalleled excitement and pride for us young filmmakers.
    The work of selecting the location for "Nameless Island" was the central task before filming. It is not difficult to find an unnamed island near the coast of the motherland, but it is a real challenge to find a "Nameless Island" in the vast sea that meets the requirements of the film. The comrades of the fleet acted as our compass. In the operations room, many comrades were wholeheartedly trying to find the "Nameless Island." Leaders and comrades from relevant departments opened nautical charts and carefully reviewed them.... Comrades with rich sailing experience also concentrated their efforts on racking their brains.... In order to solve this problem more practically, the leadership decided to go to sea for reconnaissance.
    A high-speed gunboat sped across the sea,冲过 rushing through huge waves,翻过 crossing over the billows, regardless of storms and sudden rain. It searched once, twice, three times, and many times. Finally, our naval comrades, like the heroes praised in the "Nameless Island" film, overcame nature and completed the location selection work for "Nameless Island."

    The sun had just peeked over the mountaintop when we arrived at the dock by truck. Before the actors could jump out of the car, a group of naval soldiers ran towards us to greet us warmly. "Hey! Comrade, you're the one playing ×× in the ×× movie, right?" Some soldiers excitedly greeted familiar actors. The actors humbly replied, "Yes! My acting isn't very good." At this time, everyone laughed understandingly, and our friendship began here.
    Boats are very unfamiliar to us, although we often see them in movies. In order to get familiar with sea life, we came to the boat, and everything felt new. We were like a child walking into a large garden; they smelled every flower and thought it was sweet, but couldn't name any of them.
    The comrades on the boat were afraid that we wouldn't be used to sea life, so they gave us the bunks in the front cabin and took special care of us during meals. But we couldn't live this leisurely life, so we made a request to the leaders: to live like real soldiers. So, whenever we gathered on the deck, we also lined up behind the soldiers. Regardless of the sweltering summer or the freezing cold, our naval soldiers guarded their sacred posts day and night. Especially during the days when the people of the motherland celebrated festivals, they guarded the sea defense even more diligently, and not even a grain of millet in the vast sea could escape the ears and eyes of the brave warriors. A soldier's diary recorded this passage: "The deck under my feet is the land of the motherland. The Party is my mother, and she gives me strength at all times. No matter how hard life is or how tense the battle is, it can only test my will and make me stronger." This is their unique commonality. Although the time we spent living with them was short, it was a vivid education for us.
    The filming time has come, and we have to say goodbye to our loved ones.
    "Comrade, this is a shell I picked up by the sea. I'll give it to you as a souvenir!"
    "Thank you, you've caused you a lot of trouble these days. Please keep this photo!"
    As we boarded the dock, the gunboat accepted a new mission and sailed into the distance... But our hands were reluctant to let go, still waving at the black dots in the sea...
    There was not a trace of light in the sky, and black clouds hung low over people's heads. The sea stirred up huge waves of ten feet high in the strong wind... Several American escort ships fled desperately, regardless of everything. The enemy Tai Cheng warship in the near distance was fiercely attacked by our army's artillery fire, and the engine room was hit by a mine, and the stern was hit by shells. It struggled to its death, billowing thick smoke... On the bridge, the enemy ship captain Wu John said to the gunnery officer Feng Zhan Kui in fear: "Quickly send a distress signal to our American friends"; but the "American friends" had already run away! At this moment, our army's 353 torpedo speedboat bravely rushed towards the Tai Cheng warship... In an instant, with a loud bang, the enemy Tai Cheng warship died!
    This fierce naval battle is the most difficult large-scale scene to film in the movie. If these shots are shown on the screen, it will only last for one minute, but it will take four or five working days to film. Finally, the shot of the speedboat hitting the enemy ship has to be solved with special effects. Thanks to the help of the naval comrades, sufficient research work and careful planning were done, which made this scene more realistic.

    “无名岛”外景拍摄散记
    方辉
    我们北京电影制片厂青年摄制组，光荣地接受了影片“无名岛”的拍摄任务，离开了首都，来到了祖国海防线上。在这里我们要和最可爱的人生活、工作在一起。这对我们这些年青的电影工作者来说，真是无比的兴奋和自豪。
    选择“无名岛”外景地的工作，是拍摄前的中心工作。在祖国海岸附近，想发现一个无名小岛，这不是一件难事，但是要我们在茫茫大海中找一个符合影片要求的“无名岛”，真就是个难题了。舰队的同志作了我们的指南针。作战室里，许多同志都在专心一致的去探求“无名岛”。首长和有关方面的同志翻开了海图，仔细的查阅着……。有丰富航海经验的同志也集中精力在绞脑汁……。领导上为了更实际的来解决这个问题，决定出海勘察。
    一只高速炮艇，飞驰在海面上，它冲过巨浪，翻过波涛，不管暴风和骤雨，它一次、二次、三次、多次的寻找，终于我们的海军同志们，就像“无名岛”影片中歌颂的主人公一样，战胜了自然，完成了“无名岛”场地的选景工作。
  *　　　　　　　*
    阳光刚露出山顶，我们乘卡车来到了码头。演员还没跳下车，码头上迎面跑来一群海军战士，热情地迎接我们。“喂！同志，你就是××影片里演××的吧？”有的战士兴奋地对熟悉的演员招呼。演员谦逊地回答：“是啊！演的不好。”这时大家会心地笑起来，我们的友谊就从这里开始了。
    艇，对我们来说是很陌生的，虽然在电影里也常见过。为了熟悉海上生活，我们来到艇上，看到什么都感到新鲜，真像一个孩子走到一座大花园里，他嗅到什么花都香甜，可就是叫不出她的名字一样。
    艇上的同志，生怕我们不习惯海上生活，把前舱里的几个底铺都让给我们住，吃饭也特别照顾。可是我们不能这样安详的生活下去，我们向首长提出要求：生活得和真正战士一样。于是每当在甲板上集合，我们也排在战士的后面，不管是酷夏，也不管是严寒，我们的海军战士们，他们夜以继日地坚守着神圣的岗位。特别是当祖国人民欢度佳节的日子里，他们更是加倍的严守着海防，那怕是沧海中的一粟，也逃不出勇士的耳目。一位战士的日记本里记下了这样一段话：“脚下踩的甲板，就是祖国的土地。党就是我的母亲，她时刻给我力量。生活再艰苦，战斗再紧张，它只能考验着我的意志，更坚强。”这是他们特有的共性。和他们一起生活的时间虽是短暂，对我们却是一次生动的教育。
    拍摄时间到了，我们不得不和亲人们告别。
    “同志，这是我在海边拾来的贝壳，送给你留作纪念吧！”
    “谢谢你，这些日子给你们添了不少麻烦。这张照片，请你留下吧！”
    当我们登上码头，炮艇接受新的任务，驶向远方……可是我们的手还不愿放下来，仍向大海中的黑点摇晃着……
    天空没有一丝光，黑色的云层低低地压在人们头上。海水在大风中掀起了丈高的巨浪……。几艘美国护航舰，不顾一切地逃溃着，近处的敌太成舰被我军炮火痛击下，轮机中雷，尾部中弹，它冒着浓烟作垂死的挣扎……。舰桥上，敌舰长吴约翰，恐惧地向枪炮官冯占魁说：“快向美国朋友打求救信号”；可是“美国朋友”早跑了！正在这个时候，我军三五三鱼雷快艇勇猛直前的向太成舰冲来……刹那间，一声巨响，敌太成舰呜呼哀哉！
    这场激烈的海战，是影片中最难拍摄的大场面。如果这些镜头在银幕上放映时，也仅仅有一分钟之久，而拍摄起来却需用四、五个工作日。最后快艇撞击敌舰的镜头还得用特技来解决。由于海军同志们的帮助，做了充分的研究工作和周密的计划，使这场戏拍得比较真实。
