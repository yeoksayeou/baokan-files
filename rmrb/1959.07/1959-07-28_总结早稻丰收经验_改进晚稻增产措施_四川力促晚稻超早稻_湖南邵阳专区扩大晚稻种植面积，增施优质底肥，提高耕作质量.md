This newspaper Chengdu, July 27th dispatch: Sichuan Province is vigorously promoting the "Late Rice Surpasses Early Rice" movement while rushing to harvest early rice, vigorously mobilizing the masses to summarize the experience of early rice high yield, and striving for more, earlier, and better late rice planting.

This year, late rice production in Sichuan Province is facing many new situations: the province's early rice has achieved a great harvest; labor is tight during the "Double Rush" (harvesting early rice and planting late rice); the late rice planting season is very short; in addition, the originally planned late rice area in various places is not large. Under these circumstances, how to properly arrange the current late rice production, so that late rice is planted more, earlier, and better, is a key to whether late rice can have a bumper harvest. Therefore, when some places put forward the slogan "Late Rice Surpasses Early Rice," it quickly spread throughout the province, forming a lively mass movement to strive for a bumper harvest of late rice.

Vigorously mobilizing the masses to summarize the experience of early rice bumper harvest and using early rice to promote late rice is a prominent feature of this movement. Many places made arrangements at all levels to carry out mass experience summing-up activities before rushing to harvest early rice, and to appraise the technical measures for late rice production, especially various planting measures. The masses in various places unanimously agreed in the discussions that grasping reasonable close planting, grasping fertilization, and grasping deep plowing are the central links in the current planting of late rice. According to the experience of early rice close planting, Jiang'an, Nanxi, and other counties widely promoted 3×7 and 4×6 strip planting close planting specifications suitable for the local area. Various places in Yibin Prefecture also timely applied the measures to prevent lodging by combining deep plowing, rational fertilization, and rational irrigation and drainage in early rice production to late rice planting. The second is to strive for more planting and more harvesting, and to expand the late rice area in every possible way. Luzhou Prefecture summarized the experience of the masses planting seedlings in ponds, ditches, and open spaces, and universally adopted this method to plant late rice seedlings for temporary growth. After the mid-season rice is harvested, the late rice is transplanted, which is a shortcut to expanding the late rice area. In Luxian County, Fushun, and other places alone, some communes have now planted more than 10,000 mu of seedlings. The original early rice area in Jiangjin County was 150,000 mu. After the vast masses contributed their ideas and efforts, the county expanded the late rice area to 200,000 mu.

Reasonably arranging labor and comprehensively strengthening leadership are the main measures taken by various places in Sichuan to ensure the early and good planting of late rice under the condition of tight labor. Many places also launched a surprise fertilizer accumulation movement before the "Double Rush" to prepare fertilizer for late rice, so as to stagger the time of using labor. After the "Double Rush" began, various places generally adopted the method of dividing battle lines and organizing specialized teams for plowing and transplanting, assigning work according to the technical expertise of the members, and vigorously carrying out high-efficiency movements, improving technology, and improving tools. In terms of leadership methods, emphasis was placed on grasping early planting and ensuring technical specifications. In this way, most areas have achieved fast and good planting.

During the "Double Rush," many places encountered varying degrees of drought. The broad masses actively launched a struggle against drought and rushed to plant. During the "Double Rush" period, Luzhou Prefecture mobilized 400,000 people to fight against drought, so that the drought-affected rice fields quickly dropped from 15% to 4%-5%, ensuring the timely planting of late rice.

Members of the Beigong Commune in Fuling County formed a drought-resistant commando team, carrying water and intercepting water to prepare the fields during the day, and transplanting seedlings at night. They planted late rice in five days. In some management areas, the area transplanted by carrying water accounted for nearly half.

According to a report from New Hunan Daily, the broad cadres and masses of Shaoyang Prefecture summed up the experience of increasing late rice production in previous years, analyzed the favorable conditions this year, boosted their energy, added measures, broke the "low-yield theory" of late rice, mobilized the masses to specifically calculate accounts and plan, and expanded the late rice planting area from the original planned 1.43 million mu to 1.65 million mu, striving for late rice to surpass early rice.

The late rice planting area, close planting specifications, and various yield increase measures in Shaoyang area have been widely discussed by the masses. At the beginning, some cadres and masses believed that late rice yield was low, it was a "bonus product," and there was not much "profit," so they were unwilling to plant more. The party organizations of various communes and teams mobilized the masses to use methods of summarizing, comparing, and calculating accounts, focusing on the questions of "whether or not to plant more late rice," "can late rice surpass early rice," and "how to make late rice surpass early rice," and carried out extensive discussions. Nan Ni Brigade of Gaosha Commune in Dongkou calculated a balance of gains and losses: the whole brigade originally planned to take out 1,400 mu of fields to plant autumn buckwheat, and each mu could harvest about 150 jin. However, according to water conservancy, sunshine, and other conditions, changing to plant late rice, calculated at 400 jin per mu, each mu would harvest 250 jin more than autumn buckwheat, and the whole brigade could harvest 350,000 jin more of rice. When Mao He Dian Commune in Shaodong mobilized members to discuss "whether late rice is a low-yield crop," Ning Yuanqing, a member of the Heping Production Team, said: "There is no trick to increasing late rice production, high yield with more fertilizer and early planting. The He Gong Daqiu 3.2 mu field planted by our team last year harvested 2,520 jin of dry grain, an average yield of 787 jin per mu, surpassing early rice." After discussion, all localities were determined to strive for late rice to surpass early rice.

Immediately afterwards, all localities vigorously grasped fertilizer and prepared sufficient high-quality base fertilizer for late rice. Since the end of June, the entire region has mobilized about 800,000 laborers every day to carry out a large-scale surprise fertilizer accumulation movement. At present, more than 110 million dan of various fertilizers such as fire soil ash, green manure, and pig and cattle manure have been accumulated, an average of about 60 dan per mu, of which 80% have been transported to the fields. In terms of cultivation quality, except for some deep mud fields that only use Pu Gun (a type of agricultural tool), general paddy fields are required to be plowed and harrowed once, striving for careful cultivation.

After the "Double Rush" fully started, the entire region organized 500,000 people from industrial and mining enterprises, urban residents, and government cadres to go to the countryside to provide support. In order to improve efficiency and ensure the quality of rice transplanting, all localities paid attention to rationally organizing the labor force and training rice transplanters. Many places also organized high-efficiency competitions. After the Shima Brigade of Jin Chengshi Commune in Shaoyang County carried out high-efficiency competitions, the efficiency was significantly improved.

During the "Double Rush," signs of drought appeared. Cadres at all levels led the masses to fight drought and rush to plant day and night, saving and adjusting the use of seedlings, resolutely ensuring that the late rice area was not reduced, and planting sufficient seedlings according to the close planting specifications. Longhui County suffered a more severe drought. 14,358 mu of late rice could not be planted due to lack of water. The county mobilized more than 20,000 people to block and pump water, fighting hard for seven days, and has rushed to plant more than 7,000 mu.

As of the 22nd, the entire region had harvested 1.22 million mu of early rice and rushed to plant more than 300,000 mu of late rice. At present, the people of the entire region are trying every means to strive to complete the late rice planting plan. (Attached picture)

    总结早稻丰收经验  改进晚稻增产措施
    四川力促晚稻超早稻
    湖南邵阳专区扩大晚稻种植面积，增施优质底肥，提高耕作质量
    本报成都27日电　四川省在抢收早稻同时，广泛开展“晚稻超早稻”运动，大力发动群众总结早稻丰产经验，力争晚稻种多、种早、种好。
    今年，四川省晚稻生产面临着许多新的情况：全省早稻获得大丰收；“双抢”中劳力紧张；晚稻栽插季节十分短促；此外，各地原规划的晚稻面积不大。在这一情况下，怎样妥善安排当前晚稻生产，使晚稻种的多、种的早、种的好，是关系晚稻能否丰收的一个关键。因此，当有的地方提出了“晚稻超早稻”的口号后，很快就传遍全省，形成了一个热火朝天的力争晚稻丰收的群众运动。
    大力发动群众总结早稻丰收经验，用早稻促进晚稻是这个运动的突出特点。许多地方在抢收早稻前就层层布置开展群众性的总结经验活动，对晚稻生产的技术措施，特别是栽插的各种措施进行鉴定。各地群众在讨论中一致认为，抓合理密植，抓施肥，抓深耕是当前栽插晚稻的中心环节。江安、南溪等县根据早稻密植的经验，广泛地推广了适合当地的3×7和4×6条播密植规格。宜宾专区各地还把早稻生产中深耕、合理施肥、合理排灌三者结合的防倒伏措施及时用到晚稻栽插中去。其次是力争多种多收，千方百计扩大晚稻面积。泸州专区各地总结出群众把秧苗寄种在塘堰、河沟、空地中的经验，普遍采用这个办法把晚稻秧苗寄种起来，等中稻收后把晚稻移入，为扩大晚稻面积找到了一条又好又快的捷径。仅泸县、富顺等地一些公社现在就已寄秧一万多亩。江津县早稻面积原为十五万亩，经过广大群众献计献策，全县扩大晚稻面积达到二十万亩。
    合理安排劳动力，全面加强领导，是四川各地保证在劳力紧张情况下种早、种好晚稻的一项主要措施。许多地方还在“双抢”开始前就大搞突击积肥运动，为晚稻准备肥料，以便把使用劳力的时间错开。“双抢”开始后，各地普遍采取了划分战线，组织犁田、栽秧等专业队伍的办法，按照社员技术特长分工，并大搞高工效运动，改进技术，改进工具。在领导方法方面，强调了抓早栽和保证技术规格两个环节。这样，大多数地区都做到了快栽、栽好。
    在“双抢”中，许多地方遇到了程度不同的干旱。广大群众积极展开了抗旱抢栽的斗争，泸州专区在“双抢”时期中出动了四十万人向干旱作斗争，使受旱稻田由15％迅速下降到4％—5％，保证了晚稻及时栽插。
    涪陵县北拱公社社员们组成了抗旱突击队，白天挑水、截水整田，晚上栽秧，五天就栽完了晚稻，有的管理区挑水栽秧的面积占将近一半。
    据新湖南报消息　邵阳专区广大干部和群众总结往年晚稻增产经验，分析今年的有利条件，大鼓干劲，大加措施，大破晚稻“低产论”，发动群众具体算账、规划，将晚稻种植面积由原规划的一百四十三万亩扩大到一百六十五万亩，力争晚稻赛过早稻。
    邵阳地区晚稻播种面积、密植规格和各项增产措施，都是经过群众广泛讨论的。开始，有部分干部和群众认为晚稻产量低，是“搭头货”，“油水”不大，不愿多种。各社、队党组织发动群众用总结、对比、算账的办法，围绕“要不要多种晚稻”、“晚稻能不能赛过早稻”、“怎样使晚稻赛过早稻”等问题，开展了广泛的讨论。洞口高沙公社南泥大队算了一笔得失账：全队原打算拿出一千四百亩田种秋荞，每亩约能收一百五十斤左右。但根据水利、阳光等条件，改种晚稻，以亩产四百斤计算，每亩要比秋荞多收二百五十斤，全队可多收稻谷三十五万斤。邵东毛荷殿公社发动社员讨论“晚稻到底是不是低产作物”时，和平生产队社员宁元卿说：“晚稻增产没有巧，肥多早插产量高。我们队去年种的荷公大丘三点二亩田，收干谷二千五百二十斤，平均亩产七百八十七斤，赛过早稻。”经过讨论，各地都决心争取晚稻赛过早稻。
    紧接着，各地大抓肥料，为晚稻备足优质底肥。从6月下旬起，全区每天出动约八十万劳力，开展了大规模的突击积肥运动，目前已积制了火土灰、青肥、猪牛粪等各种肥料一亿一千多万担，平均每亩约六十担，其中有80％已运到田边。在耕作质量方面，除部分深泥田只采用蒲滚外，一般水田都要求作到一犁一耙，力求精耕细作。
    “双抢”全面开始以后，全区从工矿、城镇居民、机关干部中共组织了五十万人下乡支援。各地为了提高工效，保证插秧质量，都注意了合理组织劳动力，训练插秧手。许多地方还组织了高工效竞赛。邵阳县金秤市公社石马大队开展高工效竞赛后，工效显著提高。
    在“双抢”中，旱象露头，各级干部便领导群众日夜抗旱抢插，节约调剂用秧，坚决保证不缩减晚稻面积，并按密植规格插足本秧。隆回县旱灾较重，晚稻有一万四千三百五十八亩因缺水不能插下，全县出动二万多人堵水、车水，苦战七天，已抢插了七千多亩。
    到22日止，全区已收割早稻一百二十二万亩，抢插晚稻三十多万亩，目前，全区人民正想一切办法，力争完成晚稻栽插计划。（附图片）
