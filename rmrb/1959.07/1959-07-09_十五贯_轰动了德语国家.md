    "Fifteen Strings of Cash" Causes a Sensation in German-Speaking Countries

    Our country's famous play "Fifteen Strings of Cash," after being translated into German by West German writer Günter Weisenborn last year, has been performed in Hamburg, receiving warm applause from the audience and attracting the attention of other German-speaking countries.

    After the premiere of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" at the Thalia Theater in Hamburg, many newspapers published reviews and introductory articles, affirming the success of the play. The "Hannoversche Presse" said that the adapted play preserves the characteristics of Eastern drama style and is full of poetry and folk sentiment. The Stuttgart "Nachrichten" believes that "Fifteen Strings of Cash" very skillfully tells us how Chinese drama explains a moral concept to the audience, the principle of which is: doing a righteous thing also requires wisdom and perseverance. The newspaper also said that in terms of drama, the performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is a good and promising start. The "Badisches Tagblatt" also believes that "'Fifteen Strings of Cash' will soon conquer all German stages." The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" commented that the performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" in Hamburg can be regarded as a major event in the literary and art circles, and the actors' performances were also very successful. It said that the performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is a success, and it will have an impact throughout Germany through the stage. It said that on the nights of the performances, the audience responded with prolonged applause.

      Although "Fifteen Strings of Cash" has only been staged in West Germany, its influence has spread far and wide to other German-speaking countries. For example, the "Neues Österreich" believes that the stage effect of the play "Fifteen Strings of Cash" adapted by Weisenborn is undeniable. This effect is not only because the play has detective plots and courtroom scenes, but also because the upright protagonist shows courage and wit, so that he can compete with superiors and criminals. It is through these plots that this exotic play shows its performance characteristics.

    “十五贯”轰动了德语国家
    我国著名剧本“十五贯”，去年经西德作家龚特尔·魏森堡编译成德语后，已在汉堡演出，受到观众热烈欢迎，并引起了其他德语国家的注意。
    “十五贯”在汉堡塔里阿剧院首次演出后，许多报纸发表了评论和介绍文章，肯定了这个剧本的成功。“汉诺威新闻报”说，改编的剧本保存了东方戏剧风格的特征，充满诗意和民间情调。斯图加特“消息报”认为，“十五贯”非常巧妙地告诉我们：中国戏剧如何向观众说明一种道德观念，这种道德观念的原则是：做一件正义的事也需要智慧和毅力。这家报纸并说，在戏剧方面，“十五贯”的演出是一个良好的充满希望的开端。“巴特汇报”并认为，“‘十五贯’不久将会征服德国所有舞台。”“法兰克福汇报”评论说，“十五贯”在汉堡的演出，在文艺界可算作一件大事，演员的表演也很成功。它说，“十五贯”的演出是成功的，它将通过舞台在整个德国产生影响。它说，在演出的那些天晚上观众都报以经久不息的掌声。
      “十五贯”虽然只在西德上演，但它的影响却远播其他德语国家。如“新奥地利报”认为，魏森堡改编的“十五贯”这个剧本的舞台效果是不可否认的。这种效果不仅是因为剧本具有侦察情节和公堂场面，还由于正直的主人公表现了勇敢和机智，这样他才能和上司及罪犯斗智。正是通过了这些情节，这个异国情调的剧本才显示了它的演出特征。
