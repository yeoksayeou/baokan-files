Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: People from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally this afternoon to celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Iraq. Today's celebration once again shows that on the common front of safeguarding world peace and opposing imperialism, the people of China and Iraq will continue to support each other and cooperate forever.

Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, said in his speech at the celebration meeting: The just struggle of the Iraqi people against imperialism and safeguarding national independence will always receive the heartfelt sympathy and firm support of the Chinese people. The profound friendship between the people of China and Iraq will flow forward forever like the Yangtze River and the Tigris River. Aziz Sharif, Special Representative of the Republic of Iraq, pointed out in his speech that the July Revolution has opened the way for the true and close unity between our two peoples. The road to broader cooperation in all aspects is open to us.

The people of the capital, who were infinitely delighted by the victory of the Iraqi revolution a year ago, celebrated the glorious festival of the Iraqi people today with Aziz Sharif, the special representative of the Republic of Iraq, as if celebrating their own victory. The auditorium of the CPPCC, where the celebration was held, was filled with a festive atmosphere. The national flags of China and Iraq were hung side by side on the rostrum, and the flags were covered with evergreen palm trees and blooming flowers. A huge red-bottomed gold-lettered slogan was hung on the wall opposite the rostrum: "Long live the friendship and unity between the people of China and Iraq!" The slogans on both sides of the wall were: "Long live the unity of the Asian and African people!" "Long live world peace!"

Bo Yibo, Vice Premier of the State Council, attended the meeting. Also present at the meeting were Liu Ningyi, Bao Erhan, Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Xiruo, Ji Pengfei, Chu Tunan, Wu Han, Da PUsheng, Luo Jun, Li Zaiwen, Yang Jingren, Cao Mengjun and other persons in charge of relevant departments in China.

Hadi, manager of the Iraqi Arts Union Film Company, who came to China to participate in the "Iraqi Republic Film Week" activities, was invited to attend the celebration meeting.

At about 3:00 p.m., Special Representative Aziz Sharif, accompanied by Bo Yibo, Guo Moruo and other responsible persons, stepped onto the rostrum, and young women from the capital presented flowers to Special Representative Sharif. At this time, applause poured out like a storm, and people warmly paid high tribute to the Iraqi people who had achieved major victories in the struggle to safeguard national independence.

Liu Ningyi, President of the China-Iraq Friendship Association, announced the opening of the celebration meeting. Everyone stood up, and the national anthems of Iraq and China were played successively in the hall. In his opening speech, Liu Ningyi said that the victory of the Iraqi revolution is a valuable inspiration to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It shows that as long as the people unite and fight resolutely, the seemingly powerful imperialism and reactionary forces can be defeated.

Liu Ningyi said that in the past year, the heroic Iraqi people have repeatedly crushed foreign subversion conspiracies and defended the independence and security of their motherland. We firmly believe that in the face of the well-trained Iraqi people, the vicious conspiracies of imperialism will inevitably suffer even more miserable failures.

Liu Ningyi finally said that the Chinese people express their heartfelt admiration for the major achievements made by the Republic of Iraq under the leadership of Prime Minister Kassem on the road of independent development and the policy of peace and neutrality pursued in international affairs. Liu Ningyi warmly congratulated the growing friendship between the people of China and Iraq.

Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, said in his speech: The great victory of the July 14th Revolution of the heroic Iraqi people last year not only opened a new page in the history of Iraq, but also has great international significance. In the past year, under the leadership of Prime Minister Kassem, the people of the Republic of Iraq have achieved a series of major victories in the struggle to consolidate national independence. The Iraqi people have repeatedly crushed the subversion conspiracies plotted by imperialism and defended their national independence. On the other hand, the government of the Republic of Iraq has also strengthened friendly ties with socialist countries and all peace-loving countries. At the same time, the national economy of the Republic of Iraq has also achieved certain development. The series of great achievements made by the Iraqi people have had a far-reaching and positive impact on the anti-colonial struggle of countries and people still under imperialist rule. We firmly believe that under the situation where "the East wind prevails over the West wind", as long as the socialist forces, peace forces, and national independence forces in the world continue to strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, the day of the final defeat of imperialism is not far away.

Guo Moruo said: The revolution in Iraq is an extremely heavy blow to the rule of imperialism in the entire Middle East. Therefore, from the first day of the birth of the Republic of Iraq, imperialism has regarded it as a thorn in its side and has never stopped its subversive conspiracies and sabotage activities against it. In recent times, imperialism is carrying out more vicious and deceptive aggression activities against Iraq and various Arab countries. While continuing to plan subversion activities against these countries, it is deepening political division and economic infiltration against them, alienating the relations between these countries and socialist countries, undermining the unity between these countries, and undermining the unity within the people of these countries, in an attempt to achieve the goal of defeating them one by one and making a comeback. However, the Chinese people are fully convinced that the Iraqi and Arab people who have awakened will definitely remain vigilant at all times, see through this new conspiracy of the imperialists, and completely smash it.

Guo Moruo said that the Chinese people, the Iraqi people, and the entire Arab people have always supported each other in the struggle against imperialism. The Chinese people have always regarded the victory of the Iraqi people as their own victory, because your victory is a great support for our peaceful construction and also increases the guarantee for the cause of safeguarding world peace for the people of all countries. Over the past year, the Chinese people have always cared about every revolutionary struggle of the Iraqi people with sympathy and have been delighted and encouraged by your every victory and every achievement. It can be affirmed that the just struggle of the Iraqi people against imperialism and safeguarding national independence will always receive the heartfelt sympathy and firm support of the Chinese people.

Guo Moruo finally said: The friendship between the people of China and Iraq has a long history. We firmly believe that the friendly relations between China and Iraq will continue to develop and strengthen on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit. The people of China and Iraq will forever move forward hand in hand in the common cause of opposing colonialism and safeguarding world peace. The profound friendship between the people of China and Iraq will flow forward forever like the Yangtze River and the Tigris River!

When Special Representative Aziz Sharif took the stage to speak, thunderous applause once again swept the hall. At this time, Special Representative Sharif also raised his hands and applauded, warmly expressing his greetings to everyone.

At the beginning of his speech, Special Representative Sharif first read a personal letter brought by him from Prime Minister Kassem to Premier Zhou Enlai. In his long speech full of friendly passion, he said: When we Iraqis celebrate the very cordial anniversary of the July Revolution, we should also celebrate the unity between the great Chinese people and us, and celebrate the decisive support of the Chinese people for our newborn republic. He said: The July Revolution has opened the way for the true and close unity between our two peoples. The road to broader cooperation in all aspects is open to us. Realizing this cooperation is in the interests of the people of both countries and in the interests of the cause of freedom and peace for the people of all countries.

Special Representative Sharif emphasized that our young republic was born in the struggle of unity with the people of our Arab sister countries, and was consolidated and grown up in the struggle of unity with the people of our Arab sister countries and the people of friendly countries. He also believed that the survival of the Republic of Iraq is due to the unity of the Iraqi people, and also due to the support of the brotherly Arab people, as well as the support of other peace-loving and friendly people in the world, such as the support of the Indian people, the Indonesian people, and especially the support of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Bulgaria and other socialist countries and people.

The distinguished Iraqi guest pointed out in his speech that although the Republic of Iraq has been busy defending its threatened territory from the first day of its birth and is facing the serious conspiracy of the US-British imperialist military organization to openly invade the Republic of Iraq, the Iraqi people are striving for complete independence, seeking economic, financial, and trade liberation, and have achieved significant achievements in the economic development of society. Iraq has gotten rid of the Baghdad Pact and broken the chains of the imperialist military encirclement from the western Atlantic through Eurasia to the eastern Pacific.

Special Representative Sharif said that the national strength of our people has been united. Our revolution is not a socialist revolution, but this does not harm us, because the development of our history does not yet require such a revolution. It is only a national democratic revolution, a true national democratic revolution. He said that with the unity of the national strength of the people, our republic has crossed a year full of storms, a year full of open and hidden conspiracy of aggression.

Sharif emphasized that the Iraqi people are facing today a more serious and despicable conspiracy than those open and hidden conspiracy of aggression. This is the attempt to divide our national strength, split the unity between the people and the leaders, shift the democratic tendency of our republic, and thus steal the fruits of the national democratic revolution of our republic. Therefore, we believe that the result of our people's struggle to maintain the unity of the people, the unity of democratic forces, and the unity between the people and the leadership of the nation will have a decisive impact on the struggle for freedom in all Arab countries and the entire Middle East. Because the history of the liberation of the Arab East has given our people and its national leadership a very glorious task, that is, to stand at the forefront of the freedom struggle that is taking place in this region. We believe that our people and its patriotic leadership will sincerely and gloriously fulfill his responsibilities.

Special Representative Sharif finally said with confidence: Although we are facing many complex problems, as with our many past situations, victory still belongs to us.

All the speeches at the celebration meeting constantly aroused prolonged and warm applause in the hall.

Today's conference was jointly organized by the China-Iraq Friendship Association, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Women's Federation.

Capital artists performed wonderful song and dance and acrobatic programs at the conference to celebrate the National Day of the Republic of Iraq.

A reception was also held after the celebration to welcome Special Representative Aziz Sharif. Special Representative Sharif met with people from all walks of life in our country at the reception. Everyone repeatedly raised their glasses to warmly congratulate the first anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Iraq and wish the profound friendship between the people of China and Iraq to develop forever in the struggle against colonialism and safeguarding world peace.

    中伊人民在维护世界和平的斗争中相互支持相互合作
    首都各界集会庆祝伊拉克国庆
    郭沫若表示中国人民坚决支持伊拉克反帝斗争
    谢里夫转达伊拉克人民对中国人民的友好愿望
    新华社15日讯　首都各界人民今天下午举行盛大集会，隆重庆祝伊拉克共和国诞生一周年。今天的庆祝盛会再次表明在维护世界和平和反对帝国主义的共同战线上，中伊两国人民将继续相互支持，永远相互合作。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在庆祝会上的讲话中说：伊拉克人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立的正义斗争，将会永远得到中国人民的衷心同情和坚决支持。中伊两国人民之间的深厚友谊，将像长江和底格里斯河一样，永远奔流前进。伊拉克共和国特别代表阿齐兹·谢里夫在讲话中指出，七月革命已经为我们两国人民真正的亲密无间的团结开辟了道路。在各方面实现更广泛的合作的道路向我们敞开着。
    一年前曾经为伊拉克革命的胜利而无限欢欣鼓舞的首都人民，今天又像庆祝自己的胜利一样，同伊拉克共和国特别代表阿齐兹·谢里夫一起欢庆伊拉克人民的光辉节日。在举行庆祝大会的政协礼堂里，充满了一片节日的欢乐气氛。大会主席台上并排悬挂中伊两国国旗，国旗下面布满长青棕榈和怒放的鲜花。主席台对面墙壁上高悬巨幅红底金字标语：“中伊两国人民友好团结万岁！”两侧墙壁上的标语是：“亚非人民团结万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”
    国务院副总理薄一波出席了大会。出席大会的还有我国有关方面的负责人刘宁一、包尔汉、廖承志、张奚若、姬鹏飞、楚图南、吴晗、达浦生、罗俊、栗再温、杨静仁、曹孟君等。
    前来我国参加“伊拉克共和国电影周”活动的伊拉克艺联影片公司经理哈迪应邀参加了庆祝会。
    三时许，阿齐兹·谢里夫特别代表由薄一波和郭沫若等负责人陪同登上主席台，首都女青年向谢里夫特别代表献了鲜花。这时候，全场掌声像暴风雨一样地倾泻出来，人们热烈地向在维护民族独立斗争中取得重大胜利的伊拉克人民致以崇高的敬意。
    中国伊拉克友好协会会长刘宁一宣布庆祝大会开始。全体起立，会场上先后奏起伊拉克和中国两国的国歌。刘宁一在致开幕词中说，伊拉克革命的胜利，对于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民来说，是一个可贵的启示，它说明只要人民团结起来，坚决斗争，貌似强大的帝国主义和反动势力是可以被击破的。
    刘宁一说，一年以来，英勇的伊拉克人民一次又一次地粉碎了外来的颠复阴谋，保卫了祖国的独立和安全。我们深信，在久经锻炼的伊拉克人民的面前，帝国主义的恶毒阴谋必将遭到更惨的失败。
    刘宁一最后说，中国人民对于伊拉克共和国在卡塞姆总理领导下在独立发展道路上所取得的重大成就和在国际事务中奉行的和平中立政策，表示衷心钦佩。刘宁一热烈祝贺中伊两国人民的友谊日益发展。
    人大常委会副委员长、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在讲话中说：英勇的伊拉克人民去年7月14日革命的伟大胜利，不仅给伊拉克的历史揭开了新的一页，而且具有重大的国际意义。一年以来，伊拉克共和国人民在卡塞姆总理的领导下，在巩固民族独立的斗争中取得了一系列的重大胜利。伊拉克人民接二连三地粉碎了帝国主义所策划的颠复阴谋，捍卫了自己的民族独立。另一方面，伊拉克共和国政府也加强了同社会主义国家和一切爱好和平的国家之间的友好联系。与此同时，伊拉克共和国的民族经济也有了一定的发展。伊拉克人民所取得的这一系列的巨大成就，对于还处在帝国主义统治下的国家和人民的反殖民主义斗争，产生了深远的积极的影响。我们坚决相信：在“东风压倒西风”的形势下，只要全世界的社会主义力量，和平力量和民族独立力量继续加强团结，坚持斗争，帝国主义最后失败的日子是不会很远了。
    郭沫若说：伊拉克的革命，对于帝国主义在整个中东地区的统治，是一个极其沉重的打击。因而从伊拉克共和国诞生的第一天起，帝国主义就把它视为眼中钉，从来没有停止过对它的阴谋颠复和破坏活动。最近一个时期以来，帝国主义对伊拉克和各阿拉伯国家正在进行着更加毒辣和更富于欺骗性的侵略活动。在对这些国家继续策划颠复活动的同时，正在对它们加深进行政治分化和经济渗透，离间这些国家同社会主义国家的关系，破坏这些国家彼此之间的团结，破坏这些国家人民内部的团结，妄图达到各个击破，卷土重来的目的。但是，中国人民完全相信，已经觉醒了的伊拉克和阿拉伯各国人民，一定能够随时保持警惕，洞察帝国主义者这一新的阴谋诡计，把它彻底粉碎。
    郭沫若说，中国人民和伊拉克人民以及整个阿拉伯人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中，从来就是相互支持的。中国人民一向把伊拉克人民的胜利看作是自己的胜利，因为你们的胜利对我们的和平建设是莫大的支持，使世界各国人民维护世界和平事业也增加了保障。一年来，中国人民始终以同情的心情关怀着伊拉克人民的每一个革命斗争，并且为你们的每一个胜利和每一项成就而感到欢欣鼓舞。可以肯定，伊拉克人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立的正义斗争，将会永远得到中国人民的衷心同情和坚决支持。
    郭沫若最后说：中伊两国人民之间的友谊，是源远流长的。我们深信，中伊两国的友好关系在和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的基础上，必将继续得到发展和加强。中伊两国人民在反对殖民主义和维护世界和平的共同事业中，必将永远携手前进。中伊两国人民之间的深厚友谊，将像长江和底格里斯河一样，永远奔流前进！
    在阿齐兹·谢里夫特别代表登台讲话的时候，春潮般的掌声再一次席卷会场。谢里夫特别代表这时也高举双手鼓掌，向大家热烈致意。
    谢里夫特别代表在讲话开始时，首先宣读了由他带来的卡塞姆总理给周恩来总理的一封亲笔信。他在充满友谊激情的长篇讲话中说：我们伊拉克人在庆祝使人感到非常亲切的七月革命纪念日的时候，也应该庆祝伟大的中国人民和我们之间的团结，庆祝中国人民给我们新生的共和国的决定性的支持。他说：七月革命已经为我们两国人民真正的亲密无间的团结开辟了道路。在各方面实现更广泛的合作的道路向我们敞开着。实现这种合作既符合两国人民的利益，也符合各国人民的自由与和平事业的利益。
    谢里夫特别代表强调指出：我们年轻的共和国就是在和阿拉伯姊妹国家的人民团结一致的斗争中诞生的，是在和阿拉伯姊妹国家的人民以及友好国家的人民团结一致的斗争中巩固和成长起来的。他还认为：伊拉克共和国的生存是由于伊拉克人民的团结，同时也是由于有兄弟的阿拉伯人民的支持，以及世界其他爱好和平的友好的人民的支持，如像印度人民、印度尼西亚人民的支持，特别是有苏联、中华人民共和国、保加利亚和其他社会主义国家和人民的支持。
    伊拉克贵宾在讲话中指出，尽管伊拉克共和国从诞生的第一天起就忙于保卫被威胁的国土，面临着美英帝国主义军事机构公开侵略伊拉克共和国的严重阴谋，但是伊拉克人民在争取完全的独立，在求得经济、财政、贸易的解放，以及在社会的经济的发展方面，已经获得了重大的成就。伊拉克已经摆脱了巴格达条约，把帝国主义军事机构从大西洋西部经过欧亚到太平洋东部的军事包围圈的锁链打断了。
    谢里夫特别代表说，我国人民民族力量已经团结起来了。我们的革命不是社会主义的革命，但是这对我们并没有害处，因为我们历史的发展还不需要进行像这样的革命。它只是民族民主革命，是不折不扣的民族民主革命。他说，有了人民民族力量的团结，我们共和国跨越了充满风暴的一年，跨越了充满着公开的、隐蔽的侵略阴谋的一年。
    谢里夫着重指出，伊拉克人民今天面临着比那些公开的、隐蔽的侵略阴谋更严重更卑鄙的阴谋诡计。这就是企图分化我们的民族力量，分裂人民与领导者之间的团结一致，转移我们共和国的民主倾向，从而窃取我们共和国的民族民主革命的成果。由此我们认为，我国人民为维护人民的团结、民主力量的团结以及人民与民族的领导之间的团结而进行斗争的结果，将对所有阿拉伯国家和整个中东进行自由的斗争产生决定性的影响。因为阿拉伯东方解放的历史，已经给予我国人民及其民族的领导一个十分光荣的任务，这就是站在这个地区正进行着的自由斗争的最前列。我们认为，我国人民及其爱国的领导将真诚地、荣耀地担负起他的职责。
    谢里夫特别代表最后满怀信心地说：尽管我们面临着许多复杂的问题，但正如我们过去的许多次情况一样，胜利仍然是属于我们的。
    所有庆祝会上的讲话，都不断地激起了会场上长时间的热烈掌声。
    今天的大会是由中国伊拉克友好协会、中国人民对外文化协会、中国亚非团结委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中华全国总工会、中华全国青年联合会和中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会联合举办的。
    首都艺术工作者在大会上演出精采歌舞、杂技节目，祝贺伊拉克共和国国庆节。
    庆祝大会结束以后还举行了酒会，欢迎阿齐兹·谢里夫特别代表。谢里夫特别代表在酒会上同我国各方面的人士见面，大家一再举杯，热烈祝贺伊拉克共和国诞生一周年，祝贺中国和伊拉克人民的深厚友谊在反对殖民主义和保卫世界和平的斗争中永远向前发展。（附图片）
