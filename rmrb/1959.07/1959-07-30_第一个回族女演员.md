The Hui and Han audiences of Qin腔 opera in Yinchuan, Ningxia, all enjoy watching the performances of actress Wang Zhijie. She is the first Hui actress cultivated in Yinchuan City. She plays the role of young female characters, with accurate lyrics, rounded, sonorous, and beautiful tones, and realistic movements and expressions.

Wang Zhijie is a resident of Yinchuan City and has loved literature and art since she was a child. In 1953, her father, seeing her fondness for Qin腔 opera, sent her to study at the Autonomous Region Qin腔 Opera Theater. In less than a year, she performed her first opening play, "A Twist of Fate in a Cabinet," and received good reviews from the audience. She was only twelve years old at that time. Later, she performed small excerpt plays such as "Separation at the Kiln" and "The Story of Cui Xiang." At first, she did not understand the plot, let alone how to portray the characters, but with the theater's specific training, she made rapid progress. In 1956, when she was fifteen years old, she successfully played "Wang Zhaojun." Subsequently, she successively played the female lead in many full-length plays such as "Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu," "Flame Colt," "Visiting Turtle Mountain," "White Jade Hairpin," and "Qiu Jin." Now she has performed more than 30 traditional classical plays and modern plays, becoming a rising star Qin腔 opera actress in the autonomous region. (Attached picture)

    第一个回族女演员
    在宁夏银川，秦腔的回汉族观众，都喜欢看女演员王志杰的演出。她是银川市培养出来的第一个回族女演员。她扮演正小旦角色，唱词准确，音调圆润、宏亮、优美，动作表情逼真。
    王志杰是银川市的居民，从小就喜爱文艺。1953年，父亲看到她喜好秦腔，就送她到自治区秦腔剧院学习。不到一年，她演出了第一出开场戏“柜中缘”，得到观众好评。那时她才十二岁。以后又演出“别窑”、“翠香记”等小折戏。起初，她不懂剧情，更不懂得怎样刻划人物，但在剧院的具体培养下，进步很快。1956年她十五岁时，就成功地扮演了“王昭君”。随后，她又相继演出了“贾宝玉与林黛玉”、“火焰驹”、“游龟山”、“白玉钿”和“秋瑾”等许多大本戏中的女主角。到现在她已演出传统古典剧和现代剧目三十多个，成为自治区后起之秀的秦腔演员了。（附图片）
