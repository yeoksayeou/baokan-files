Four years ago, a French female mountaineer named Claude Kogan climbed Ganesh Himal, a peak in the Himalayas rising 7,456 meters above sea level, from within Nepal. Since then, people have called this French female athlete "the tallest woman in the world," meaning that no other woman in the world has climbed to a higher altitude than her.

Indeed, in the twenty-five years since female mountaineers appeared in the world in 1934, no woman mountaineer from any country had climbed a peak higher than Claude Kogan. However, in just one year since China started women's mountaineering, nine female mountaineers have broken the world record held by Claude Kogan. Among them, eight female athletes climbed to the summit of Muztagh Ata, which rises 7,546 meters above sea level, collectively setting the world record for women's mountaineering.

These eight Han and Tibetan female mountaineers from China are only twenty-six years old at most, and only twenty years old at the youngest. Four of them are students, two are female farm workers, one is a doctor, and one is a technical worker. They demonstrated a communist spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act in their mountaineering endeavors. Before conquering the "Father of Ice Mountains," they swore to the motherland and the people at the base camp 4,500 meters above sea level: "For the honor of the motherland and the people... we will never turn back until we step on Muztagh Ata!"

Anyone with mountaineering and aviation knowledge will understand how difficult it is to conquer a mountain rising 7,546 meters above sea level. People must be unafraid of difficulties and be able to adapt to the low air pressure, lack of oxygen, and extreme cold of high mountains to reach the summit.

On July 2, they set off alongside male mountaineers and reached the first high-mountain camp (5,500 meters above sea level) above the snow line on the same day. Along the way, like the male team members, they braved blizzards and crossed countless ice and snow cracks, climbed many ice slopes and snow slopes. They moved step by step, gradually increasing their altitude. They helped the collective, and the collective also helped them. The Tibetan female team member, Xi Rao, in addition to carrying her own equipment, also volunteered to carry a portion of food for three other members of the group. She is a female worker at the "July 1st" farm in Lhasa, and years of labor have developed her physical strength beyond that of the average man. The female deputy leader and Communist Party member, Yuan Yang, often took meticulous care of her comrades, so some team members affectionately called her "Sister Yuan Yang." When camping on the snow at 6,200 meters above sea level, she often helped other male comrades cook. Near the ice and snow crack area at 6,800 meters above sea level, the male team member Mu Bing Suo's feet were numb with cold. The female team member Wang Gui Hua rushed to massage his feet for him, and then they advanced together.

"Persistence is victory," is the common slogan of all female mountaineers. During the ascent, Wang Yi Qin, an internal medicine doctor and Communist Party member, had her lips chapped by the cold, and fresh blood dripped onto her chest and the snow. Many team members advised her to rest, but considering that rest would affect the marching speed of the collective, she insisted on moving forward.

Poor appetite at high altitudes brought great difficulties to the female mountaineers. After reaching 6,200 meters, they could only eat one or two spoonfuls of rice porridge a day; after reaching areas above 6,800 meters, most of the female team members could only drink some boiled water. Marching in the snow mountains greatly consumed their physical strength, and the extreme cold and lack of oxygen made their lips and fingers numb and purple. Qi Mi, a Tibetan female team member and member of the Communist Youth League who had begged for food with her mother since she was seven years old and entered the Lhasa Tibetan Cadre School after liberation, found it difficult to move her feet due to the cold when she reached the fourth high-mountain camp at 7,200 meters above sea level. However, a belief supported these outstanding female mountaineers of the motherland: the honor of the motherland and the people, which enabled her to ignore these difficulties and move step by step towards the summit.

On July 7, nine female mountaineers and the main team set off from the fourth high-mountain camp to climb the summit of Muztagh Ata. When they reached 7,500 meters above sea level, the female deputy leader, Yuan Yang, who had been vomiting frequently for three days, was obviously unable to support herself, but she firmly said: "I can still walk! I can still walk!" She took a step and fell on the snow, then got up and walked again, fell again after one step... In order to prevent her from having an accident, the team decided to escort her down the mountain, which forced her to stop advancing towards the summit. Wang Yi Qin, an internal medicine doctor, and Cong Zhen and Wang Gui Hua, students from the Beijing Institute of Geology, also felt their legs weaken at this altitude, but they still insisted on moving forward. Wang Yi Qin thought at the time: Could it be that we can't even walk the remaining distance? Difficulties, difficulties, what are such difficulties compared to the 25,000-mile Long March and the long years of revolutionary struggle of the Chinese Communists? She took three or four breaths for every step she took. Due to the lack of oxygen at high altitude, it was difficult to breathe even with her mouth wide open. She counted her steps, one step, two steps... She calculated her breaths, ten times, twenty times...

Shi Zhan Chun, Director of the Mountaineering Department of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, and Xu Jing, the captain of the mountaineering team, and six male mountaineers were the first to reach the summit. They happily watched as the female mountaineers and the male team members came up one by one. 7,546 meters above sea level, what a high altitude! Chinese female mountaineers finally overcame numerous difficulties and reached an altitude that no other female mountaineer in the world had ever reached. It is difficult to describe the excitement of the people at that time.

A arduous battle with the "Father of Ice Mountains" has come to a victorious end. Although the faces of the Chinese female mountaineers peeled again and again due to the reflection of strong ultraviolet rays, and some people's hands and feet were also frostbitten, they became stronger and braver in this struggle.

    高山女英雄
    新华社记者　杨克现　张克灿
    四年以前，一个叫做克·郭刚的法国女子登山运动员，曾经从尼泊尔境内登上了喜马拉雅山脉一座拔海七千四百五十六米的加内什山峰。从那时以后，人们都把这个法国女运动员称为“世界上最高的女人”，意思是说，世界上再没有其他妇女比她登上的高度更高了。
    的确，从1934年世界出现女子登山运动员二十五年以来，还没有任何一个国家任何一个女子登山运动员攀登上比克·郭刚登上的山峰更高。但是，我国开展女子登山运动只一年的光景，就有九名女子登山运动员打破了克·郭刚保持的这个世界纪录。其中有八名女运动员攀登到了拔海七千五百四十六米的慕士塔格山顶峰，集体创造了世界女子登山的最高纪录。
    我国这八名汉、藏族女子登山运动员，最大的只有二十六岁，最小的才二十岁。其中有四名是学生，两名是农场的女工，一名是医生，一名是技术工作人员。她们在登山事业中发挥了敢想、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格。在征服“冰山之父”以前，她们曾经在拔海四千五百米的大本营基地向祖国、向人民宣誓：“为了祖国和人民的荣誉……不把慕士塔格踩在脚下，决不回头。”
    稍有登山知识和航空知识的人都会懂得，征服一座拔海七千五百四十六米的高山是多么不容易的事，人们只有不畏困难，以及能够适应高山的低气压、缺乏氧气和极度严寒等气候，才能够达到高山的顶峰。
    7月2日，她们和男子登山运动员并肩出发，当天就到达了雪线以上的第一号高山营地（拔海五千五百米）。途中，她们和男队员一样，冒着大风雪越过了无数冰雪裂缝，爬过了不少冰坡和雪坡。她们一步一个脚印，一步一步的升高。她们帮助集体，集体也帮助了她们。藏族女队员西绕除了背自己的装备外，还抢着背小组其他三人的一部分食品。她是拉萨“七一”农场的女工，多年的劳动生活，锻炼出她超乎一般男子的体力。女副队长、共产党员袁扬因为经常对同志体贴备至，一些队员都亲切地叫她“袁扬姐”。在拔海六千二百米的雪地上宿营，她常常帮助其他男同志煮饭。在接近拔海六千八百米的冰雪裂缝地区，男队员穆炳锁脚冻得麻木了，女队员王贵华便赶上去替他按摩，然后又一起前进。
      “坚持就是胜利”，这是所有女子登山运动员的共同口号。在登山途中，内科医生、共产党员王义勤嘴唇冻裂了，鲜血点点滴滴洒到胸前，洒到雪地上。许多队员都劝她休息，但她考虑到休息会影响集体的行军速度，还是坚持前进。
    高山上的食欲不振，给女子登山运动员带来了极大的困难，当她们到达拔海六千二百米的高处以后，一天里只能吃一两勺大米稀饭；到达拔海六千八百米以上的地区以后，多数女队员只能喝一些开水。雪山行军大大消耗了她们的体力，严寒和缺氧使得她们嘴唇和手指麻木发紫。七岁就跟着母亲讨饭、解放后进入拉萨藏族干部学校学习的藏族女队员、共青团员齐米，到了拔海七千二百米的第四号高山营地时，脚已经冻得疼痛难以移步。但是，有一个信念支持着这些祖国的优秀女子登山运动员，这就是祖国和人民的荣誉，使她依然不顾这些困难，一步一步地向顶峰前进。
    7月7日，有九名女子登山队员和大队一起，从第四号高山营地出发去攀登慕士塔格山顶峰。行至拔海七千五百米的地方，三天来经常呕吐的女副队长袁扬体力显然已经支持不住了，但她仍然坚决地说：我还能走！我还能走！她走一步便倒在雪地上，然后爬起来又走，一走又倒在雪地上……，为了不使她发生意外，队部决定护送她下山，才使得她不得不停止了向顶峰挺进的脚步。内科医生王义勤和北京地质学院学生丛珍、王贵华在这样的高度，腿也发软了，但她们依然坚持前进。王义勤当时曾经这样想：难道剩下这么近的距离也走不到了吗？困难、困难，这样的困难和中国共产党人两万五千里长征和革命斗争漫长的岁月相比又算得上什么呢？她每走一步，就要气喘三四下。由于高山缺氧，张大口呼吸也感到困难。她数着自己的步伐，一步、两步……，她计算着自己的呼吸，十次、二十次……。
    国家体委登山处处长史占春和登山队队长许竞等六名男子登山队员最先到达山顶。他们高兴地望着我国女子登山运动员和后面的男队员一个个地上来了，拔海七千五百四十六米，这是多么高的高空啊！我国女子登山运动员终于克服了重重困难，第一次登到了世界上没有其他女子登山运动员曾经达到过的高度。要叙述人们当时激动的心情，是十分困难的。
  　一场和“冰山之父”的艰苦斗争胜利地结束了。我国女子登山运动员虽然脸上被强烈的紫外线反射一次又一次地脱皮了，有些人的手脚也冻肿了，但她们在这场斗争中却变得更加坚强、更加勇敢。（附图片）
