    Plant Late Rice Well, Fertilizer and Water First
    Nanjing Promotes Returning Rice Straw to Fields: Low Cost, High Fertilizer Efficiency
    Linxiang Jinpen Brigade Prepares Water for Late Rice in Advance
    (Our dispatch) Nan Jing County, Fujian Province, is comprehensively promoting the return of rice straw to the fields to solve the problem of insufficient base fertilizer for summer planting. So far, 98% of the harvested early rice from the county's more than 60,000 mu has been returned to the fields as base fertilizer for late rice. Of the 156,000 mu of early rice planted in the county this year, all but 2% will be returned to the fields.
    Nanjing County is located in a mountainous area with sufficient fuel and abundant feed sources. Historically, the masses have kept late rice straw as feed, and the straw mats used in winter are also made of late rice straw. After the early rice harvest, people return the rice straw to the fields to solve the problem of base fertilizer for late rice. In the years since liberation, the area of rice straw returned to the fields has gradually increased to about 80%. After the rice straw is returned to the fields, the late rice grows very well, generally increasing production by more than 10%.
    Rice straw is a good organic fertilizer, containing a certain amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Every hundred catties of rice straw also contains more than ten catties of silicic acid, which can promote strong stalks and prevent lodging. Returning rice straw to the fields not only has high fertilizer efficiency, but also has the following benefits: first, it can improve the soil, making it loose, increasing soil organic matter, and enhancing drought and insect resistance; second, after the rice straw is returned to the fields, it ferments and rots, which can kill rice borers in the rice stalks and reduce borer damage; third, it requires less labor, with only half a work day per mu to return rice straw to the fields, which is three and a half work days less than accumulating the same amount of fertilizer.
    To promote the decomposition of rice straw, add 20-30 catties of lime or plant ash per mu; after returning it to the field, immediately plow and irrigate the field, and block the field ridges. After three to five days, the rice straw will rot.
    This year, since the start of the summer harvest, the county party committee has been focusing on returning rice straw to the fields to compensate for the lack of base fertilizer for late rice. All communes and brigades, in accordance with the instructions of the county party committee, retain a small amount of rice straw for handicrafts and household use, and return the rest to the fields while harvesting.
    98% of the rice straw from the more than 60,000 mu of early rice that has been harvested in the county has been returned to the fields as fertilizer. After the rice straw from the more than 150,000 mu of early rice in the county is returned to the fields, it is equivalent to adding 4 million dan of water fertilizer.
    (Our dispatch) One of the important conditions for completing the late rice expansion plan is to ensure that the late rice fields have sufficient water. Jinpen Brigade of Taolin People's Commune in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, while rushing to harvest early rice, appropriately arranged labor to make full preparations for the use of water for late rice fields.
    Jinpen Brigade plans to plant 2,100 mu of late rice this year, an increase of 400 mu over last year, requiring more water. It has not rained for more than ten days recently, and drought is emerging, making the water problem more tense than in previous years. After careful study by brigade cadres and experienced farmers, emergency measures were taken to ensure the water needs of autumn crops. First, check, repair, and reinforce the dikes of ponds and dams, and divert water into the ponds. Each production team conducted a general inspection and rush repair of the ponds and reservoirs within its scope, tightening the culverts that were not tightly sealed and repairing the collapsed dikes. Second, strengthen leadership, improve water management organizations, and achieve rational and economical use of water. The water from the Meiyi Reservoir of the old Bai production team was originally jointly managed and used by the old Bai, Xinzhuang, and Caishi production teams, with one water manager per team. There was no system for releasing water, resulting in a lot of waste. Recently, it was decided that one person would be responsible for implementing "one hoe to release water," and methods for rational and economical water use were stipulated. Each production team formulated a water management and use agreement. Third, in some severely water-deficient areas, organize manpower to draw water and maximize the effectiveness of mechanical power. In the past few days, the entire team has set up seven waterwheels and installed pedal waterwheels along streams and rivers.
    Through the above methods, the water problem for late rice in this brigade has been largely solved, and the ponds and reservoirs have been basically filled with water.

    插好晚稻  肥水先行
    南靖推广稻草回田成本低肥效高
    临湘金盆大队提前为晚稻准备用水
    本报讯　福建南靖县全面推广稻草回田，以解决夏种基肥不足的问题。到目前为止，全县已收的六万多亩早稻，有98％的稻草都回田作为晚稻基肥。全县今年种植的十五万六千多亩早稻，除2％留作他用以外，其余稻草都将回田。
    南靖县地处山区，燃料充足，饲料来源丰富，历来群众都留晚稻草做饲料，冬季用的草垫也都用晚稻草。人们在早稻收获以后，就以稻草回田，解决晚稻基肥问题。解放几年来，稻草回田面积逐渐增到80％左右。稻草回田以后，晚稻生长都很好，一般要增产一成以上。
    稻草是一种良好的有机质肥料，含有一定数量的氮、磷、钾肥分。每百斤稻草还含有十多斤的矽酸，可以促进秆粗穗壮和防止倒伏。稻草回田不但肥效高，而且还有这样一些好处：一是能改良土壤，促使土壤松软，增加土壤有机质和增强防旱保虫能力；二是稻草回田后，发酵腐烂，能消灭稻秆中的螟虫，减少螟害；三是花工少，稻草回田每亩只需花半个工，比积同样数量的肥料要少花三个半工。
    为了促进稻草腐烂，每亩田可加二三十斤石灰或草木灰；回田后，立即翻犁，灌水溶田，堵塞田埂，经过三五天，稻草就烂了。
    今年夏收开始，县委就大抓稻草回田工作，以弥补晚稻基肥的不足。各个公社、大队都根据县委指示，除留下少量稻草作为手工业和家庭用草外，做到边收、边回田。
    全县已收割的六万多亩早稻已有98％的稻草回田作肥。全县十五万多亩早稻草回田后，等于增加了四百万担的水肥。
    本报讯　完成晚稻扩种计划的重要条件之一，是使晚稻田有足够的用水量。湖南临湘县桃林人民公社金盆大队在抢收早稻的同时，适当安排劳力，对晚稻田用水做了充分的准备。
    金盆大队今年计划种植晚稻二千一百亩，比去年增加四百亩，需水量多。最近十多天没有下雨，旱象露头，水的问题比往年显得更加紧张。大队干部和老农仔细研究后，采取了紧急措施，以保证秋种作物的需水量。一是检查补修塘坝堤堰，引水入塘。各生产队对本队范围内的塘坝、水库都普遍进行了一次检查和抢修，把没有塞严的涵管塞紧，把倒了的堤堰修好。二是加强领导，健全管水机构，做到合理用水，节约用水。原来老柏生产队的梅宜水库的水是由老柏、新庄、蔡市三个生产队共同负责管理使用的，一个队一个管水员，放水没有制度，浪费很多。最近，决定由一个人负责，实行“一把锄头放水”；并且规定了合理和节约用水办法，各生产队都制定了管水用水公约。三是在一些严重缺水地区，组织人力车水，也尽量发挥机械动力的效用。最近几天，全队已经在溪边、河畔架起了七个车埠，安装脚踏水车。
    通过以上办法，这个大队晚稻的用水问题已经大致解决，塘坝、水库已经基本蓄满了水。
