Shandong Formulates Specific Autumn Planting Plan

    (Our dispatch) Shandong Province, which achieved a great wheat harvest, is deeply summarizing its summer high-yield experiences and actively preparing for autumn planting in order to strive for an even greater wheat harvest next year.

    The experiences summarized by various regions generally include the following points:
      (1) Earnestly implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture is the magic weapon for increasing agricultural production. During last year's autumn planting, various regions had little to no objection to the water, fertilizer, seed, protection, labor, and management aspects of the "Eight-Point Charter"; however, some people expressed doubts about whether close planting and deep plowing would increase production. However, the fact of this summer's bumper harvest educated the people and unified their understanding.
    (2) Wheat must be sown in a timely manner. In Cheng Guan Commune, Sishui County, sowing eight days earlier resulted in a 3% increase in production compared to sowing eight days later. Similarly, fields plowed to a depth of two feet with the same management conditions yielded eighty to one hundred twenty more catties per mu when sown ten days earlier than those sown ten days later.
    (3) It is necessary to develop both large-area high-yield fields and to attend to ordinary fields; both increasing yield per unit area and ensuring an increase in total output are required.

    Currently, various regions are formulating autumn planting plans based on summarizing high-yield experiences and are making autumn planting preparations in many ways. All regions universally emphasize fertilizer preparation, generally requiring 3,000 catties per mu for ordinary fields and more than 5,000 catties for high-yield fields. The measures adopted by various regions for accumulating fertilizer are: vigorously accumulating green manure, vigorously accumulating barnyard manure, and manufacturing local chemical fertilizer. Secondly, do a good job of seed preparation. In addition to preparing an average of 25 catties of improved seeds per mu for autumn planting throughout the province, it is also necessary to do a good job in the storage of seeds and the adjustment of improved varieties. Thirdly, ordinary fields should be deeply plowed to a depth of six inches to one foot, and high-yield fields can be plowed slightly deeper. Fourth, prepare water-lifting tools and farm implements.

    The Provincial Party Committee convened an autumn planting preparation meeting attended by the heads of rural work departments of prefectural and municipal party committees from July 10th to 15th. The meeting requested the various local and municipal party committees to organize mass discussions widely at the end of July and the beginning of August, do a good job in contracting work and output quotas, and make autumn planting plans—including adjustments to crop rotation. At the same time, it required party committees at all levels to combine the development of large-area high-yield fields with ordinary fields, pay attention to low-yield areas, and find ways to turn low-yield areas into high-yield areas.

### 山东制定秋播具体规划

    山东制定秋播具体规划
    本报讯　获得小麦大丰收的山东省，正深入总结夏季丰产经验，积极为秋种作准备，以争取明年小麦更大丰收。
    各地总结的经验，一般有以下几点：
      （1）认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，是农业增产的法宝。在去年秋种时，各地对“八字宪法”中的水、肥、种、保、工、管等，都没有异议或者异议很少；但是对密植和深翻地能否增产，却有些人表示怀疑。可是今年夏季丰收的事实教育了人们，统一了认识。
    （2）种麦必须适时。泗水县城关公社早播八天的比晚播八天的增产3％。同样深翻二尺的田，管理情况也相同，但早播十天的比晚播十天的，每亩多增产八十到一百二十斤。
    （3）既要搞大面积丰产田，又要抓一般田；既要提高单位面积产量，又需要保证总产量增加。
    目前，各地正在总结丰产经验的基础上，制订秋种计划，从多方面作好秋种准备。各地普遍重视肥料准备，一般是要求一般田每亩三千斤，丰产田五千斤以上。各地采取的积肥措施是：大积绿肥，大积厩肥，制造土化肥。其次，做好种子准备，全省秋种除平均每亩准备二十五斤良种外，还要做好种子的保管和良种调剂工作。第三，一般田要深翻六寸到一尺，丰产田可稍深一点。第四、作好提水工具和农具准备。
    省委已在7月10日到15日召开了地、市委农村工作部长参加的秋种准备会议。会上要求各地、市委，在7月底8月初组织群众广泛讨论，做好包工包产工作，做出秋种打算——包括地块茬口调整等。同时，要求各级党委把抓大面积丰产田和一般田结合起来，注意抓低产区，设法使低产变高产。　　　　（王京文）
