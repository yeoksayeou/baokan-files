Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: Vice Chairman Dong Biwu's speech at the reception given by the Polish Ambassador to China in celebration of the 15th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Poland. Dear Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

	The year 1959 can be said to be a year particularly worthy of celebration for our great socialist camp. In this year, several members of our socialist family will be welcoming the 10th or 15th anniversary of their birth with their own glorious achievements. This is a matter of great international significance because this fact powerfully demonstrates that the newborn socialist system will ultimately replace the decadent capitalist system. It is precisely for this reason that we are very happy today to join our fraternal Polish comrades here in celebrating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Poland. Please allow me to take this valuable opportunity to express, on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, our warmest congratulations to the government of the People's Republic of Poland and the fraternal Polish people.

	The diligent and brave Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, in the short fifteen years since liberation, have not only healed the serious wounds that German fascism brought to Poland, but have also fundamentally changed the face of their motherland, transforming Poland from a backward agricultural country into an industrial and agricultural country with advanced industry. Today's Poland, as a strong member of the socialist camp, plays an important role internationally and has become a powerful factor in maintaining world peace and European security. All this convincingly proves how amazing the creativity that liberated people can unleash! The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, convened in March this year, comprehensively summarized the experience of the Polish socialist revolution and socialist construction, and formulated the instructions for the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy in the future.

	This instruction clearly points out the future direction for the Polish people, and the Polish people see their brighter future from this instruction, and therefore have won the enthusiastic support of the entire Polish working people. The Polish people, with a tradition of internationalism, solemnly declared that they will contribute to the competition of the socialist system against the capitalist system by completing and overfulfilling the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy. The Chinese people are sincerely happy for the brilliant achievements made by the fraternal Polish people and are convinced that under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party headed by Comrade Gomulka, the Polish people will surely victoriously complete their plan.

	The people of China and Poland have established a deep fighting friendship as early as in the years when they were fighting for their own independence and liberation. This friendship has been fully and fully developed after the people of the two countries have achieved complete liberation and established socialist countries. We are very pleased to see that in the past ten years, our two governments and peoples have established solid and close friendly and cooperative relations in political, economic and cultural fields. There is no doubt that this friendly and cooperative relationship will continue to be further developed.

	It is particularly worth mentioning here that the Polish government and people have given us a lot of help and support in our economic construction and in the struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. For this, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Chinese government and people.

	Finally, I propose
	To the increasing prosperity and strength of the People's Republic of Poland,
	To the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Poland,
	To the increasing consolidation and strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
	To the health of the leading comrades of the Polish United Workers' Party and the government of the People's Republic of Poland headed by Comrade Gomulka,
	To lasting world peace,
	Cheers!

    在波兰大使庆祝国庆招待会上
    董必武副主席的讲话
    新华社22日讯　董必武副主席在波兰人民共和国驻华大使庆祝波兰人民共和国建国十五周年招待会上的讲话。亲爱的大使同志，同志们，朋友们：
    1959年可以说是我们伟大的社会主义阵营特别值得欢庆的一年。在这一年当中，我们社会主义大家庭里有好几个成员都要以自己光辉的成就来迎接自己诞生的十周年或十五周年。这是具有重大国际意义的事情，因为这一事实有力地显示出新生的社会主义制度必将最终地代替腐朽的资本主义制度。正是由于这个原因，我们今天十分高兴地同我们亲如手足的波兰同志们一道在这里欢度波兰人民共和国建国十五周年国庆节。请允许我利用这个可贵的机会，代表中华人民共和国政府和人民，向波兰人民共和国政府和兄弟的波兰人民表示最热烈的祝贺。
    勤劳勇敢的波兰人民，在波兰统一工人党的领导下，在解放后短短的十五年中，不仅医治好德国法西斯带给波兰的严重创伤，并且根本改变了自己祖国的面貌，把波兰从一个落后的农业国变成为一个具有先进工业的工农业国家。今日的波兰已经作为社会主义阵营中坚强的一员，在国际上起着重要的作用，成为维护世界和平和欧洲安全的一个有力因素。这一切都令人信服地证明，解放了的人民能够发挥出令人多么惊异的创造力！今年3月间召开的波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会全面地总结了波兰社会主义革命和社会主义建设的经验，制定了今后七年发展国民经济计划的指示。
    这个指示，为波兰人民明确地指出了今后的奋斗方向，波兰人民从这个指示当中，看到了自己更加美好的未来，因此获得了波兰全体劳动人民热烈的拥护。有着国际主义传统的波兰人民庄严地宣告，他们将以完成和超额完成七年发展国民经济计划来为社会主义制度对资本主义制度的竞赛作出贡献。中国人民为兄弟的波兰人民所取得的光辉成就感到由衷的高兴，并且深信，在以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党的领导下，波兰人民定将胜利地完成自己的计划。
    中波两国人民远在各自为着本国的独立和解放而斗争的年代里就已建立起深厚的战斗友谊。这种友谊在两国人民获得了彻底的解放并建立起社会主义的国家之后得到了全面的、充分的发展。我们十分满意地看到，十年来我们两国政府和人民在政治上、经济上和文化上都已建立了巩固的、亲密的友好合作关系。毫无疑问，这种友好合作关系必将继续不断地得到更大的发展。
    这里特别值得提出的是，在我国经济建设和维护国家主权和领土完整的斗争中，波兰政府和人民曾给予我们许多帮助和支持。为此，我代表中国政府和人民表示衷心的感谢。
    最后，我建议
    为波兰人民共和国的日益繁荣和富强，
    为中波两国人民牢不可破的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的日益巩固和强大，
    为以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党和波兰人民共和国政府领导同志们的健康，
    为世界持久和平，
    干杯！
