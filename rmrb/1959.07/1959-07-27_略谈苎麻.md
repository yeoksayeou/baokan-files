    A Brief Introduction to Ramie

    Ramie is an important economic crop in our country. Ramie is characterized by its high tensile strength, generally eight or nine times greater than cotton, making it the strongest among bast fibers. Therefore, ropes, cables, fishing nets, and fishing gear used in shipping and fishing, tire cords and reinforcing fabrics for various rubber products, as well as aircraft wing fabrics, parachutes, conveyor belts, etc., all require ramie as a raw material. Ramie's water absorption is slower and less than that of silk and cotton, while its moisture release is faster than that of silk and cotton. When woven into summer cloth for clothing, it is very cool and comfortable to wear in summer. Ramie also has the characteristics of strong insulation, strong resistance to mold, and fast heat transfer, making it very widely used in industry.

    Ramie waste (i.e., ramie fuzz) is also a good industrial raw material, and the utilization of ramie waste is now beginning in various places. For example, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces use ramie waste blended with cotton to manufacture various kinds of checkered fabrics, floral fabrics, and plain fine cloth. Some places also use it to make fibrous flax boards for sound insulation, insulation, heat preservation, and moisture protection.

    Our country's ramie not only has a wide range of uses domestically, but also enjoys a great reputation in the international market. As early as 1810, it began to be sold to countries such as Britain, France, the United States, Belgium, and Japan, and is known as "China Grass, Nanjing Ramie."

    Ramie is mainly produced in the humid and hot southern regions of our country, such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan. Before liberation, due to the cruel exploitation and destruction of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, some ramie fields were abandoned and production shrank. In 1950, the national output was only 48% of that in 1936. After liberation, ramie production developed rapidly. For example, taking the 1949 ramie output as 100, it was 126% in 1953 and 208% in 1958. As production continues to expand, the state's procurement of ramie has also been increasing year by year. For example, taking the 1952 procurement volume as 100, it was 120% in 1953, 139% in 1954, 141% in 1955, 146% in 1956, 162% in 1957, and 174% in 1958. Due to different climates in different regions, the ramie production seasons vary. Generally, three crops of ramie are produced per year in most areas, and some areas produce ramie all year round (such as individual areas in Guangdong, Hunan, and Anhui provinces), while some areas (such as Shandong and Shaanxi) produce two crops of ramie per year. The ramie harvest season is very intensive, with each harvest season generally lasting about ten days. Therefore, timely and proper arrangements must be made for the labor force involved in ramie production, peeling, and scraping, and sufficient preparations must be made for the procurement work.

    略谈苎麻
    苎麻是我国的一种重要经济作物。苎麻的特点是拉力大，一般要比棉花大八、九倍，是麻类中拉力最大的。因此，航海、渔业上用的绳缆、渔网、渔具，汽车轮胎和各种橡胶制品的衬布，以及制做飞机翼布、降落伞、传送带等，都需要用苎麻作原料。苎麻的水分吸收力比丝、棉花慢而小，而水分的散发力却比丝、棉花快，用它来织成夏布做成衣服，夏天穿在身上非常凉爽舒适。苎麻还有绝缘性强、抗霉力强、传热快等特点，在工业上的用途非常广泛。
    苎麻下脚（即苎麻绒）也是很好的工业原料，目前各地对苎麻下脚也正开始利用。如江苏、浙江等省利用苎麻下脚与棉混纺制造出各种各样的格布、花布和平纹细布。有些地方还用它制成纤维性麻板，作隔音、绝缘、保温、防湿之用。
    我国苎麻不仅在国内有广泛的用途，在国际市场上也有很大名望。远在1810年就开始销往英国、法国、美国、比利时和日本等国，具有“中国草、南京麻”之称。
    苎麻主要产在我国的湖北、湖南、江西、四川等南方湿热地带。解放前，由于遭受国民党反动统治的残酷剥削和破坏，有些麻田荒芜，生产萎缩，1950年全国产量仅及1936年的48％。解放后，苎麻生产发展很快，如以1949年麻产量作为一百，1953年则为126％，1958年则为208％。由于生产不断扩大，国家对苎麻的收购也是逐年增加，如以1952年收购量为一百，1953年则为120％，1954年则为139％，1955年则为141％，1956年则为146％，1957年则为162％，1958年则为174％。由于各地气候不同，产麻季节不一，一般地区年产三季麻，有些地区一年四季产麻（如广东、湖南、安徽等省的个别地区），有的地区（如山东、陕西）一年两季产麻。苎麻的收获季节很强，每一收麻季节一般在十天左右。因此，对苎麻生产、剥麻、刮麻的劳力，必须做到适时妥善的安排，收购工作也必须作好充分准备。
