Don't Let Useful Timber Be Lost on the Mountains
Heilongjiang Forest Area Collects Small Timber to Process Pit Props and Utensils
Huanan Forestry Bureau Improves Logging Techniques to Reduce Timber Wastage

This newspaper reports that in the upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, the forestry enterprises of Heilongjiang Province, while striving to increase timber production, are also improving the timber utilization rate in many ways.

Many forestry bureaus have adopted various measures to fully utilize small-diameter wood and large branches to increase the production of pit props, while ensuring quality. In terms of timber for construction in forest areas, efforts are made to use waste timber as much as possible and control the consumption of small-diameter wood. Small-diameter wood and large branches are fully utilized in the selection and conversion of materials. At the same time, staff and their families are mobilized to collect small-diameter wood and large branches scattered on both sides of the forest railway, around the mountains, and in the "numbered roads" of the logging areas. By the end of June, the staff of the Huanan Forestry Bureau had produced more than 1,600 cubic meters of pit props using only the wood collected from the mountains. In the first half of the year, the sixteen forestry bureaus in the Songhua River area collected wood to produce a total of more than 6,600 cubic meters of pit props.

In order to make full use of "waste materials," many forestry bureaus have developed hillside sawmills and implemented simple on-site processing. Since the beginning of this year, the Songhua River area alone has adopted simple and self-reliant methods to establish more than 30 small-scale waste material processing plants (stations), and by early April, more than 12,000 cubic meters of finished wood had been processed from more than 37,000 cubic meters of "waste materials." Since the beginning of the year, the forestry bureaus in the Mudanjiang forest area have processed more than 100,000 cubic meters of sleepers, square timber, and various boards from substandard materials and waste materials, and used the sawdust and edge materials left over from timber processing to produce a large number of fiberboards and artificial boards. In April and May, the Yichun forest area also collected the short and hard hardwoods discarded on the mountains and made more than 4,100 pieces of utensils such as shovel handles, axe handles, wooden boxes, wooden barrels, and cart boards. This not only supplied the needs of agriculture and handicraft industries, but also made full use of timber.

This newspaper reports that the Huanan Forestry Bureau of Heilongjiang Province is actively improving logging techniques, lowering stumps, and reducing timber wastage.

The bureau formed a working group with the participation of the Party Committee Secretary, the Bureau Chief, and the Chairman of the Trade Union to study together with the grassroots and the staff, summarize new operational experiences in logging techniques, and then promote them throughout the bureau through on-site meetings. The new operating methods are: when logging, cut the tree legs and chop off the stumps, remove the moss from the roots and the weeds and residual branches near the ground, and use both axes and saws. This can lower the stumps to ground level. The efficiency of small-diameter wood is also greatly improved by changing from cutting off by timber workers to sawing off by branch workers. For example, according to the first quarter inspection of the Qidaogou First Forestry Farm, an average of 26% of the stumps in each hectare of logging area exceeded the height, eight bald trees were missed, and 28% of the timber conversion was unreasonable, discarding more than nine cubic meters of small-diameter wood. After implementing the policy of "rational logging, rational timber conversion, and rational use of timber" and promoting new operating methods, the stumps have generally been lowered to ground level, the timber conversion is done according to the size of the material, and bald trees and branches above three centimeters are all utilized. The timber utilization rate has increased from the original 70% to 90%. This year, the bureau can save more than 31,000 cubic meters of good timber for the country and increase the production of small-diameter wood from three centimeters to five centimeters by more than 161,000 stacked cubic meters.

    不让有用之材丢在山上
    黑龙江林区搜集小木料加工坑木和用具
    桦南林业局改进采伐技术减少木材损耗
    本报讯　黑龙江省林业企业在增产节约运动中，一面力争增产木材，一面从多方面提高木材利用率。
    许多林业局采取多种措施，在保证质量的前提下，充分利用小径木、大枝桠增产坑木。在林区建设用材方面，尽量利用废旧木材，控制小径木的消耗量；在选材、造材中充分利用小径木和大枝桠；同时发动职工和家属把散弃在森林铁路两侧、山场周围、伐区“号道”上的小径木、大枝桠拣回来。桦南林业局职工到6月底，仅是利用从山场上拣下来的木料制成的坑木，就有一千六百多立方米。松花江地区十六个林业局上半年拣回的木料，共制成坑木六千六百多立方米。
    为了把“废材”充分利用起来，许多林业局发展靠山制材，实行就地简易加工。今年以来，仅松花江地区就采用因陋就简、自力更生的办法，建立起三十多处小型废材简易加工厂（站），到4月上旬就从三万七千多立方米“废材”中加工制成一万二千多立方米成材。牡丹江林区各林业局自年初以来，从等外材、废材中共加工出枕木、方材和各种板材十多万立方米，并利用加工木材剩下来的锯末、边料等生产了大量纤维板和人造板。伊春林区还在4、5月份把弃置在山上的短小硬杂木收集起来，制成锹把、斧把、木箱、木桶、车辕板等用具四千一百多件。这样不仅供应了农业和手工业部门的需要，而且充分利用了木材。
    本报讯　黑龙江省桦南林业局积极改进采伐技术，降低伐根，减少木材损耗。
    这个局由党委书记、局长、工会主席亲自参加，组成工作组到基层和职工一起研究，总结出新的采伐技术操作经验，然后通过现场会议在全局推广。新的操作方法是：采伐时砍树腿、砍下楂，清除根部青苔和靠近根部地面的杂草、残枝，实行斧锯并用，这样可以使伐根降低到地平面。小径木由过去造材工截断改为打枝桠工截锯后，工效也大大提高。如据七道沟第一林场第一季度检查，平均每公顷采伐迹地伐根超过高度的占26％，漏伐秃头树八株，造材不合理的占28％，丢弃小径木九立方米以上。贯彻“合理采伐、合理造材、合理用材”方针、推行新操作方法后，伐根普遍降低到地平面，造材做到量材细造，秃头树、三厘米以上的枝桠也全部被利用，木材利用率由原来70％提高到90％。今年这个局共可为国家节约好材三万一千多立方米，增产三厘米到五厘米小径木十六万一千多层积立方米。
