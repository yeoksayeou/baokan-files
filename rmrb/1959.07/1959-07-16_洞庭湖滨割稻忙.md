The rhythmic sounds of rice threshers fill the air, the tall dikes transform into drying grounds, and piles of grain stretch into the distance. In many places, offices and clubs have been emptied to serve as granaries.

Changsha, July 15th (Reported by this newspaper) – The rhythmic sounds of rice threshers are echoing across the vast shores of Dongting Lake. Changde Prefecture in Hunan Province has already harvested over 50,000 mu of early rice. After threshing, drying, and weighing, the average yield per mu has increased by approximately 10% to 20% compared to the bumper harvest of last year. This marks the first bumper harvest season of early rice since the establishment of the people's communes.

The Dongting Lake Plain is the main early rice-producing area in Hunan Province. This year, it has over 3.8 million mu of early rice, accounting for more than half of the total rice area. The bumper harvest of early rice is a great encouragement to the farmers. In the boundless polder fields, male and female commune members are happily engaged in a concentrated harvest. On the crisscrossing canals, small boats shuttle back and forth, transporting late rice fertilizer to the fields and returning home fully loaded with golden rice. The wide and sturdy dikes serve as excellent drying grounds for the lake area farmers. Gleaming piles of grain stretch into the distance, one after another. The characteristic of this year's early rice bumper harvest in this area is a large-scale, balanced increase in production, with bumper harvests everywhere and increased production in every commune. In the fields, on the threshing grounds, in the canteens, and in the homes of commune members, the good news is spreading everywhere: "This year's bumper harvest is truly outstanding, with third-class seedlings producing first-class grain!"

With the early rice harvested, rice is piled up like mountains everywhere. In some places, there are so much grain that even finding enough space for turning, drying, and storing it has become a problem. Farmers in Nanxian, Changde, and other counties are appropriately allocating labor while harvesting early rice to level drying grounds and build temporary granaries and sheds. Nanxian has recently built more than 2,000 temporary grain sheds to store the grain in a timely manner. In many other places, public buildings such as offices and clubs have been temporarily emptied to store grain.

The Dongting Lake Plain covers an area of approximately 3,000 square kilometers and has always been known by the masses as fertile land "where you can squeeze oil out with one foot." However, before liberation, it was plagued by floods and waterlogging year after year. After liberation, the Party and the government led the masses in large-scale water conservancy construction, which basically eliminated floods in recent years. However, because water conservancy construction took up a large portion of the labor force, there was not enough attention to intensive cultivation. Although rice production increased year by year, the growth rate was not very large. After the establishment of the people's communes here in September last year, they demonstrated tremendous superiority. The communes divided their forces into two groups, carrying out water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation simultaneously. They also carried out preliminary management of the polder's drainage and irrigation system, reducing waterlogging disasters. At the same time, the rice paddies were heavily fertilized, and the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture was implemented relatively comprehensively, resulting in a bumper harvest of early rice.

    洞庭湖滨割稻忙
    扮禾桶不断鸣响，高大的围堤变成晒谷场，大谷堆一个接一个伸展到远方，不少地方把办公室俱乐部腾出来作了谷仓
    本报长沙15日电　在广阔的洞庭湖滨扮禾桶咚咚地响起来了。湖南常德专区已收割早稻五万多亩，经过脱粒晒干过秤，一般每亩产量较丰收的去年增产一成到两成左右。这是人民公社化后第一个早稻丰收季节。
    洞庭湖滨平原是湖南省的早稻主要产区。这里今年有三百八十多万亩早稻，约占水稻面积的一半以上。早稻丰收带给农民莫大的鼓舞。在一望无边的垸田里，男女社员们在愉快地突击收割。在纵横交织的渠道上，小船往来如梭地把晚稻肥料运下田，又满载着金黄色的稻谷回家。宽大结实的堤防是湖区农民的好晒谷场，金光闪闪的大谷堆，一个接一个，伸展到远方。今年这个地区早稻丰收的特点是：大面积平衡增产，处处丰收，社社增产。在田间、在打谷场上，在食堂、在社员家里，到处传播着：“今年丰产真突出，三类苗扮出了一类谷”的喜讯。
    早稻丰收了，稻谷到处堆积如山，有些地方谷子多得连翻晒收藏的地方都成了问题。南县、常德等县农民在收割早稻的同时，都适当安排劳动力，平整晒谷场，盖临时谷仓、谷棚。南县在最近就盖了两千多个临时谷棚，才把谷子及时收藏起来。还有不少地方把办公室、俱乐部等公房都暂时腾出来堆谷。
    洞庭湖滨平原约有三千多平方公里，一向被群众叫做“一脚踩得出油”的肥沃地带。但是，解放前，这里不淹就渍，连年闹水灾。解放后，党和政府在这里领导群众进行了规模巨大的水利建设，这几年基本上消灭了水灾。但是由于修水利占去很大部分的劳动力，顾不上精耕细作，稻谷产量虽逐年提高，增长比例不很大。去年9月这里实现人民公社化后，就显示出巨大的优越性。公社兵分两路，修水利、积肥同时进行，而且对垸里排灌系统进行了初步整理，减少了渍水灾害；同时稻田施肥多，比较全面地贯彻了“八字宪法”，因此获得早稻大丰收。
