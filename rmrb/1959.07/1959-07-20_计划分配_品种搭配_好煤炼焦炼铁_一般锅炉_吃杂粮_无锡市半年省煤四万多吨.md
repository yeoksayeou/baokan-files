Planned Allocation, Variety Matching, Good Coal for Coking and Ironmaking, Ordinary Boilers "Eat Coarse Grains"
Wuxi City Saves More Than 40,000 Tons of Coal in Half a Year

Our Newspaper, Nanjing, July 19th: The Wuxi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, mobilizing factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, and street residents throughout the city, is making every effort to save coal and support steel production. In the first half of the year, they saved a total of more than 43,000 tons of coal, equivalent to 70% of the city's monthly coal consumption.

The coal used in Wuxi City is supplied from other places, and there are frequent contradictions between the quantity and variety and the needs. The Wuxi Municipal Committee attaches great importance to this issue. In order to improve this situation, a coal conservation office was established in November of last year. In addition to taking a series of coal conservation measures in the smelting sector, it also mobilized all departments and street residents throughout the city to actively carry out coal conservation activities.

At the same time, the Municipal Committee also took a series of measures to strengthen the organizational leadership of coal conservation. First, a system of planned allocation and variety matching supply was implemented for industrial coal consumption throughout the city. The principle of using high-quality bituminous coal for coking and ironmaking, and ordinary boilers "eating coarse grains" was implemented, with quantities and varieties allocated to each household, so that production units could "know a month in advance," which facilitated users' planning of coal consumption. At present, all factories in the city have successively established coal storage and coal consumption recording systems to strengthen the management and planned use of coal. In addition, in the coal consumption of residents' lives, activities have also been carried out to save five briquettes per stove per day.

Second, the method of adopting typical experiments, gaining experience, and promoting it universally, and carrying out coal conservation competitions was adopted to guide and promote coal conservation work. At the beginning, some employees had many concerns about saving and substituting coal, mainly fearing that it would affect production. For example, when the forging factory tried using white coal to replace bituminous coal for iron smelting, some old workers said: "We have been forging iron for decades, and have never heard of white coal being able to smelt iron." Later, after the experiment was successful, they were invited to see it, and it was universally promoted. The leaders of Wuxi City also divided the 56 production units throughout the city that consumed more than 50 tons of coal per month, such as textiles, silk reeling, light industry, and chemical industry, into 11 groups according to regional conditions and equipment status, to carry out coal conservation competitions in the same industry. Through the competition, they inspected each other and promoted each other. For example, the No. 1 Silk Reeling Factory originally burned two boilers. After inspection and evaluation, it was considered sufficient to burn only one. After the factory adopted the opinion and made improvements, the daily coal consumption immediately decreased by two and a half tons. At present, more than 30 factories in the city are burning 20%-50% peat in combination. This change not only has no impact on production, but also reduces costs.

The coal conservation activities in Wuxi City have also promoted technological innovation work. For example, the lime factory originally burned earthen kilns, using high-quality bituminous coal as fuel, and the coal consumption per ton of lime was 0.318 tons. Later, three vertical kilns were rebuilt, replacing bituminous coal with white coal, and coal consumption dropped to 0.19 tons, while production increased by more than double.

The East China Coordination Zone Committee recently held a coal conservation experience exchange meeting in Wuxi City for six provinces and one city, comprehensively and systematically summarizing the coal conservation experience of Wuxi City. The meeting unanimously agreed that Wuxi City's achievements in saving coal are significant because the Party committee has grasped it tightly, the direction is clear, and the methods are specific. The representatives all expressed their determination to use the experience of Wuxi City to promote coal conservation work in their regions after they return.

    计划分配　品种搭配　好煤炼焦炼铁　一般锅炉“吃杂粮”
    无锡市半年省煤四万多吨
    本报南京19日电　中共江苏省无锡市委发动全市工厂、企业、机关、学校和街道居民，千方百计节约煤炭，支援钢铁生产，上半年合计节约煤炭四万三千多吨，相当于这个市一个月用煤量的70％。
    无锡市所用的煤炭是由外地供应的，数量和品种与需要之间经常发生矛盾。无锡市委对这个问题非常重视。为了改善这种状况，于去年11月成立了节约用煤办公室，除在冶炼部门采取了一系列的节约用煤措施外，并动员了全市各部门和街道居民，积极开展了节约用煤的活动。
    同时，市委还采取了一系列的措施，加强了节约用煤的组织领导。首先，是对全市工业用煤实行了计划分配、品种搭配供应的办法。贯彻了优质烟煤用于炼焦炼铁，一般锅炉“吃杂粮”的原则，实行数量到户、品种到户，使生产单位能够
  “一月早知道”，便于用户计划用煤。目前，全市各厂都已先后建立了煤炭保管和煤耗记录制度，加强了对煤炭的管理和计划使用。此外，在居民生活用煤当中，还开展了每炉每天节省五个煤球的活动。
    其次，是采用了典型试验，取得经验普遍推广和开展节约用煤竞赛的办法，指导并推动节约用煤工作。开始时，有的职工对节约和代用煤炭存在着不少的顾虑，主要的是怕影响生产。如锻压厂试用白煤代烟煤化铁时，有的老工人说：“我们打了几十年铁，从没听说过白煤能化铁。”后来试验成功了，请他们来看过以后，就普遍推广开了。无锡市的领导方面还将全市纺织、缫丝、轻工业、化学工业等每月用煤在五十吨以上的五十六个生产单位，按地区条件、设备状况，划成十一个组，开展同行业节约用煤竞赛。通过竞赛，互相检查，互相促进。如缫丝一厂原来烧二只锅炉，检查评比后，认为只要烧一只就够了。这个厂采纳意见经过改进后，每天用煤量立即降低了二吨半。目前全市已有三十多个工厂搭烧20％—50％的泥炭。这种变动，不仅对生产毫无影响，而且还降低了成本。
    无锡市的节约用煤活动，还推动了技术革新工作。如石灰厂原来烧土窑，使用的燃料是优质烟煤，每吨石灰的耗煤量是零点三一八吨，后来改建了三只竖窑，以白煤代替烟煤，煤耗下降到零点一九吨，产量却提高了一倍以上。
    华东协作区委员会最近在无锡市召开了六省一市节约用煤经验交流会，全面系统地总结了无锡市节约用煤的经验。会议一致认为，无锡市由于党委抓得紧，方向明确，办法具体，节约煤炭的成绩是显著的。代表们都表示决心回去后要用无锡市的经验来推动本地区的节约用煤工作。
