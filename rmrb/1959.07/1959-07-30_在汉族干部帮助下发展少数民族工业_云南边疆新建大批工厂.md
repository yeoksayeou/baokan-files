Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 29th: In the minority areas of Yunnan's border region, which are transitioning directly to socialism, 413 agricultural tool manufacturing, light industrial factories, and workshops have been established, producing over 100 kinds of agricultural tools, homespun cloth, medicinal herbs, pottery, porcelain, and other products.

    The production methods of the 660,000 people of the Kawa, Lisu, Jingpo, Nu, Dulong, and other ethnic groups living in Yunnan's border areas were very backward. Before liberation, iron farm tools were scarce, with generally only one or two iron farm tools per village. Although there was a start to handicrafts, it had not yet separated from agriculture, with no specialized craftsmen, let alone industry. They could not manufacture agricultural tools nor process agricultural products. After liberation, the Party and the government not only transported large quantities of farm tools and daily necessities from the interior, distributing them to farmers of all ethnic groups free of charge, but also sent Han cadres and technical workers to the border areas to help establish simple farm tool manufacturing plants and various light industrial factories. In the Ximeng Kawa Autonomous County, more than 30 Han and Lahu workers have helped to establish factories for agricultural tools, fertilizers, pottery, wild plant processing, etc., producing more than 10 kinds of products such as plowshares, porcelain bowls, sickles, machetes, aromatic oils, and ethnic clothing. In the past, the Kawa people used bamboo darts to poke holes in fire-cleared land to plant corn. Now, they are using plows of their own making to cultivate the land. In the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Jingpo women used to weave cloth with a few wooden sticks, taking half a year to weave a single skirt. Now, a weaving factory has been established in Yingjiang County, and Jingpo women have learned to use looms to weave cloth.

    With the emergence of industry in the minority areas of the border regions, the ranks of minority workers have grown. According to preliminary statistics, there are now more than 3,500 workers of various ethnic groups in these areas.

    在汉族干部帮助下发展少数民族工业
    云南边疆新建大批工厂
    新华社昆明29日电　云南边疆直接向社会主义过渡的少数民族地区已经建立了四百一十三个农具制造、轻工业工厂和作坊，制造出一百多种农具、土布、药材、陶器、瓷器等产品。
    居住在云南边疆的六十六万佧佤、傈僳、景颇、怒、独龙等族人民的生产方式原是很落后的，解放前铁质农具很少，一般一个村子只有一两件铁质农具。虽然开始有了一点手工业，但是还没有从农业中分离出来，没有专门的手工业者，更没有工业，不能制造农具，也不能加工农产品。解放后，党和政府一面从内地运来大批农具和日用品，无偿地发给各族农民，一面派汉族干部和技术工人，到边疆帮助建立简单的农具制造厂和各种轻工业工厂。西盟佧佤族自治县已在三十多名汉族和拉祜族工人帮助下建立了农具、肥料、陶器、野生植物加工等工厂，生产了犁头、瓷碗、镰刀、砍刀、芳香油、民族服装等十多种产品。过去佧佤人用竹制镖子在火焚后的土地上戳个洞栽种玉米，现在已经用自己铸造的犁犁田了。德宏傣族景颇族自治州的景颇族妇女，过去用几根木棍织布，一条裙子要织半年，现在盈江县成立了织布厂，景颇族妇女学会用织布机织布了。
    随着边疆少数民族地区工业的出现，少数民族工人队伍成长起来了。据初步统计，这些地区现在已有三千五百多名各民族工人。
