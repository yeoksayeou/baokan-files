    Song of Lusha'er
    Zhang Yongmei
    The golden dome of the temple dazzles the eye, the eaves bells of the temple jingle. Below the temple, beside the river valley, is the place of Lusha'er. Lusha'er, Lusha'er, white poplars grow among the canals, beside the canals, flat-roofed houses, green vegetables grow on the rooftops. Lusha'er, Lusha'er, new buildings face the earthen houses, loudspeakers are installed on the corners of the eaves, songs from Beijing fly in all directions, a glass window under the eaves, sunlight shines brilliantly, reflecting the red flag in the sky, reflecting the white poplars in the river. Lusha'er, Lusha'er, the Hui compatriots ride on donkeys, holding water jugs in both hands, swaying left and right. Passing the flat-roofed earthen houses, passing the newly built buildings, singing a "Hua'er" tune, singing the praises of their good hometown: "I love the golden dome of the temple, even more so the newly built buildings, the eaves bells are certainly pleasant to hear, but the songs from Beijing have even more power! Lusha'er, Lusha'er, my good place…."

    鲁沙尔之歌
    张永枚寺庙的金顶晃眼，寺庙的檐铃叮当。寺庙下，河谷旁，是鲁沙尔地方。鲁沙尔，鲁沙尔，河渠当中生白杨，河渠边，平顶房，青菜长在屋顶上。鲁沙尔，鲁沙尔，土屋对面新楼房，喇叭安在屋檐角，北京的歌声飞四方，檐下一扇玻璃窗，阳光射来多辉煌，映着空中的红旗，映着河里的白杨。鲁沙尔，鲁沙尔，回族老乡骑在毛驴上，双手提着水罐子，左一晃，右一晃。走过平顶的土屋，走过新修的楼房，唱着花儿调，歌唱好家乡：“我爱寺庙的金顶，更爱新修的楼房，那檐铃显然动听，北京的歌声更有力量！鲁沙尔，鲁沙尔，我的好地方……。”
