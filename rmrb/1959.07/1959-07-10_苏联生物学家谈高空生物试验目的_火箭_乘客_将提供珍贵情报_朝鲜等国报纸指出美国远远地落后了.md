Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th – What kind of information will the three "passengers" of the Soviet first-stage high-altitude geophysical rocket, the dogs "Brave," "Snowflake," and a rabbit, bring back to human science has aroused great interest. Today, some Soviet biologists published articles in newspapers, introducing the purpose of this high-altitude biological experiment and its relationship to future space flight.

Soviet Deputy Doctor of Physiology Isakov wrote in "Air Force News" that the animals carried by this rocket, in addition to two dogs, also include a rabbit. This is to study different animals at the same time, because various animals have different adaptability to the external environment. This way, more complete material on the changes in the reactions of biological organisms can be obtained. This research is necessary to solve medical and physiological problems in future human spaceflight. In addition, conducting experiments on three animals at the same time allows for checking the different conditions of each animal, to obtain material on the impact of spaceflight on different conditions.

It seems that materials on how the functions of animal organisms, which are less adaptable to acceleration than dogs, will change during flight may be obtained from this rabbit, which is participating in the experiment for the first time. At the same time, we can see what other effects the rabbit will be subjected to.

Some scientists specifically talked about the importance of studying the changes in these creatures' digestive systems, blood circulation, muscle activity, and nervous systems.

Academician Balin of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences said: One of the basic characteristics of this experiment is to observe the coordination of the animals' muscle activity and the various conditions of their muscle system functions. The study of this issue is extremely important, because, in future spacecraft, we must know what kind of situation the driver who needs to complete various complex tasks will be in when he is in a state of weightlessness, whether he will lose the ability to discern direction in the air for a long time, and whether he can maintain balance in his actions. Academician Balin said: Regarding these issues, high-altitude rocket flights will bring valuable materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th – North Korea's "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today, congratulating the success of the Soviet Union's launch of a high-altitude geophysical rocket.

The commentary said, "Contrary to the amazing achievements of Soviet science, the science of the United States and other Western countries is far behind in this regard." The commentary pointed out, "As long as the U.S. ruling clique uses science for the purpose of slaughtering humanity and heinous aggression, it will not be able to overcome its backwardness in this area."

Xinhua News Agency, Addis Ababa, 9th – TASS reported from Addis Ababa: On the 8th, all Ethiopian newspapers prominently published the news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of a first-stage geophysical ballistic rocket carrying animals. The "Ethiopian Herald" emphasized that the launch of such a rocket "gives us reason to say that in this race, the Russians have left the Americans far behind."

    苏联生物学家谈高空生物试验目的
    火箭“乘客”将提供珍贵情报
    朝鲜等国报纸指出美国远远地落后了
    新华社莫斯科8日电　苏联一级高空地球物理火箭的三个“乘客”，小狗“勇士”、“雪花”和一只兔子会给人类科学带回些什么情报，引起了人们很大兴趣。苏联一些生物学家今天纷纷在报端发表文章，介绍了这次高空生物试验的目的和它与未来宇宙飞行的关系。
    苏联生理学副博士伊萨科夫在“空军报”上写道，这支火箭载有的动物，除了两只狗还有一只兔子，这是为了对不同的动物同时进行研究，因为各种动物对外界环境具有不同的适应性，这样就可以获得生物机体反应变化的更完整的材料，这种研究是解决未来人类宇宙飞行中的医学、生理学问题所必需的。此外，同时用三只动物试验，就可对每一只动物不同的条件进行检查，以获得宇宙飞行对不同条件的影响材料。
    看来，关于对加速度作用的适应性比狗更弱些的动物机体功能在飞行中会起怎样变化的材料，可能从这只第一次参加试验的兔子身上得到。同时，可以看一看这只兔子还会受到一些什么其他的影响。
    一些科学家具体谈到了研究这些生物的消化系统、血液循环、肌肉活动和神经系统的变化的重要性。
    苏联医学科学院院士巴林说：这次试验的一个基本特点是，观察这些动物肌肉活动的协调和它们肌肉系统功能的各种情况。这一问题的研究是极端重要的，因为，未来宇宙飞船中，需要完成各种复杂任务的驾驶员，我们必须知道，当他处在失重情况下时，他将是一种怎样的情况，他会不会在空中长期的失去辨别方向的能力，他能不能使自己的行动保持均衡。巴林院士说：关于这些问题，高空火箭的飞行会带来珍贵的材料。
    新华社平壤9日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论，祝贺苏联发射高空地球物理火箭的成功。
    评论说，“同苏联科学的惊人的成就相反，美国及其他西方国家的科学在这方面远远地落后了。”评论指出，“只要美国统治集团把科学用于屠杀人类和可恶的侵略目的，它就克服不了在这方面的落后状态。”
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社亚的斯亚贝巴讯：8日，埃塞俄比亚各家报纸都显著刊登了苏联成功地发射带有动物的一级地球物理弹道火箭的消息。“埃塞俄比亚先驱报”强调说，发射这样的火箭“使我们有根据地说，在这个竞赛中俄国人已经把美国人远远地抛在了后面”。
