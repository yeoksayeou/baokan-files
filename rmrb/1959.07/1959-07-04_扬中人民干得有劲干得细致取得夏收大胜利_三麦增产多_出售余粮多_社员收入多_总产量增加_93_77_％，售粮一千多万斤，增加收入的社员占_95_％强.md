Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 3rd: Amidst the triumphant reports of bumper harvests of three wheats from all over the country, Yangzhong County, located in the heart of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, has also announced the good news of a comprehensive bumper harvest: the total output of 100,000 mu of barley, naked barley, and wheat in the county reached 42,960,000 jin, an increase of 93.77% compared to 22,170,000 jin in 1958. The surplus grain sold by the county increased from 1.7 million jin last year to 10.17 million jin, exceeding the grain sales plan. The rations distributed to commune members have also increased compared to the same period last year, and over 95% of commune members have increased their income.

This year, Yangzhong County has not only achieved a large increase in total output, but also a relatively balanced large-scale increase in production in all areas of the county. The areas with better soil and higher yields in the past naturally had very high yields this year, and the areas with poorer soil and low yields in the past also had a large increase in production this year. Xinglong Commune is a high-yield area in the county, with an average yield of 285 jin per mu of three wheats last year, and an average yield of 389 jin per mu of three wheats this year. Fengyu Commune, which has always had low yields, increased its single-crop yield of three wheats from 155 jin last year to 315 jin this year. The yield of more than 30,000 mu of low-yield fields in the county has increased by more than 100% compared to last year.

From the perspective of the natural conditions of Yangzhong County, there are both favorable and unfavorable aspects to striving for a large-scale increase in the production of three wheats. The favorable aspects are: the county is surrounded by rivers on all sides, most of the soil is good, the land is relatively fertile, the water source is sufficient, and there is generally no fear of drought; moreover, there is little land and many people, with an average of only more than two mu of land cultivated per labor force, which is conducive to intensive cultivation. The unfavorable aspect is also because it is surrounded by rivers on all sides, the terrain is low-lying, and the river water level often exceeds the ground level by one meter, so the groundwater level is very high, and accumulated water is not easy to drain, often suffering from severe waterlogging. The county has more than 30,000 mu of leaking sand fields with very poor soil. Before liberation, these fields were often "unharvested nine years out of ten." Faced with such objective conditions, the Yangzhong County Party Committee gave full play to its subjective initiative, and starting from the autumn sowing last year, it aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people throughout the county and adopted a series of corresponding measures to strive for a bumper summer harvest this year.

Based on the characteristics of little land, many people, and good soil quality, the Yangzhong County Party Committee correctly adopted the two-pronged approach of striving for high yields in large fields and striving for multiple planting and multiple harvests. In addition to changing the original grass-wheat intercropping fields into single cropping, it also made full use of high fields, "ten sides" and other scattered wasteland and open spaces, and sowed more than 7,000 mu of wheat. As a result of the harvest, these high fields, marginal land, and intercropped wheat fields alone yielded a total of 5,218,000 jin of wheat, accounting for 12.14% of the total output.

The county has more than 70,000 laborers, of which women account for about two-thirds. In the process of striving for high yields in large fields and improving unit yields, the county party committee also made full use of the favorable condition of abundant labor and carried out intensive cultivation on more than 100,000 mu of wheat fields, and universally promoted advanced technical measures. During the autumn sowing last year, all parts of the county changed the past habit of sowing wheat fields without plowing, and wheat fields were generally deeply plowed to a depth of six inches to one foot. The width of the wheat ridges was expanded from four feet in the past to about one zhang, and the uncultivated land was reduced from six inches in the past to four inches, which greatly improved land utilization. When sowing, various improved varieties were generally selected, and all were subjected to wind selection, screening, salt water selection, and dressing with chemicals.

After the autumn sowing was completed, the County Party Committee promptly put forward the slogan "Manage wheat like embroidery, not a stitch or thread can be wrong." The people of the county carefully cultivated the three wheat fields with meticulous skill. After the regreening stage, the wheat seedlings grew vigorously. When applying top dressing, in order not to damage a single seedling, the commune members first sieved fertilizers such as wall ash and smoked soil into fine powder, and then sprinkled them on the fields by hand. When the wheat seedlings on some wheat ridges were not growing evenly, the commune members used human manure to spot-water them one by one to promote the balanced growth of wheat seedlings on each wheat ridge. When entering the jointing stage, since the wheat seedlings were thick and strong, it was inconvenient to use hoes to remove grass, the commune members used their hands and the tips of small shovels to pull out the weeds in the wheat seedlings one by one.

In order to change the unfavorable conditions of low-lying terrain and high groundwater level, all parts of the county dredged all the river ports and dam heads to lower the groundwater level of the river ports. All wheat fields were dug with drainage ditches, and a field drainage system was established. Taking the Changhao Wei of the Happiness Management Area of the Baqiao Commune as an example, a total of 170 drainage ditches were dug for this Wei's 86 mu of wheat fields. The drainage ditches in the wheat fields of the county are all about one foot five inches deep. There are horizontal ditches at both ends of each wheat field, and waist ditches in the middle. From a distance, they form beautiful "king" and "work" shapes. The large-scale digging of drainage ditches has basically achieved "沟沟相通、河河通港、港港通江" [every ditch is connected, every river is connected to a harbor, and every harbor is connected to the river], controlling the entry of river water and accelerating drainage.

In January of this year, Yangzhong County launched a competition initiative to strive for the realization of a thousand jin per mu of three wheats in the county. Facts have proved that this initiative played an extremely important role in mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and winning the bumper harvest of three wheats this year. Although the thousand-jin target was only achieved on a small portion of the land this year, the rich experience in increasing production accumulated by it has laid a solid foundation for the comprehensive bumper harvest of three wheats this year, and created conditions for a bumper harvest this autumn and next year.

Recently, all localities are summing up their experiences in increasing production, and also looking for loopholes and lessons in their work, in order to strive for a greater bumper harvest in autumn and next year. (Attached pictures)

    扬中人民干得有劲干得细致取得夏收大胜利
    三麦增产多　出售余粮多　社员收入多
    总产量增加93.77％，售粮一千多万斤，增加收入的社员占95％强
    本报南京3日电　在全国各地三麦丰收的一片喜报声中，江苏省扬子江心的扬中县，又传来全面大丰收的佳音：全县十万亩大麦、元麦、小麦的总产量，达到了四千二百九十六万斤，比1958年的二千二百十七万斤增长93.77％。全县售的余粮从去年的一百七十万斤增加到一千零十七万斤，超额完成了售粮计划。社员分得的口粮也比去年同期有所增长，95％以上的社员增加了收入。
    今年，扬中县不但总产量增长幅度很大，而且全县各个地区都取得了比较平衡的大面积增产。原来土质较好、产量较高的地区，今年产量固然很高，原来土质较差，产量低的地区，今年增产的幅度也很大。兴隆公社是全县的高产区，去年三麦每亩平均单产二百八十五斤，今年三麦每亩平均达到三百八十九斤。一向产量很低的丰裕公社，今年的三麦单产量由去年一百五十五斤提高到三百一十五斤。全县三万多亩低产田的产量都比去年增长了一倍以上。
    从扬中县的自然条件来看，争取三麦大面积增产，有有利的一面，也有不利的一面。有利的是：这个县四面环江，大部分土质较好，土地比较肥沃，水源充足，一般不怕干旱；而且地少人多，平均每个劳力只耕作二亩多地，便于进行精耕细作。不利的也正因为四面环江，地势低洼，江面水位经常超过地面一公尺，因而地下水位很高，积水不易排出，常常遭受严重的涝害。全县有三万多亩漏沙田，土质很坏，解放前这些田经常是“十年九不收”的。面对这样的客观条件，扬中县委充分发挥了主观能动作用，从去年秋种开始，就鼓起了全县人民的革命干劲，采取了一系列相适应的措施，力争今年夏季大丰收。
    根据地少、人多、土质好的特点，扬中县委正确地采取了力争大田高产和力争多种多收的两条腿走路的方针，除将原来草麦夹种田分别改为单种外，同时充分利用高田、“十边”等零星荒地、空地，播种了七千多亩麦子。收成的结果，仅仅这些高田、边地和夹种的麦田中，就一共收到五百二十一万八千斤麦子，占总产量的12.14％。
    全县有七万多劳动力，其中妇女约占三分之二，在争取大田高产，提高单位产量的过程中，县委又充分利用了劳动力较充裕的这个有利条件，对十万多亩麦田进行了精耕细作，普遍推行了先进的技术措施。去年秋种时，全县各地改变了过去麦田不耕就种的习惯，麦田普遍深翻六寸到一尺左右，麦垄的宽度都由过去四尺扩大到一丈左右，荒塿由过去的六寸缩小到四寸，大大提高了土地利用率。在播种时，普遍选用了各种良种，并且全部进行了风选、筛选、盐水选种和药剂拌种。
    秋种结束后，县委及时提出了“管麦如绣花，一针一线也不差”的口号，全县人民用精雕细刻的功夫，精心培植三麦田。在返青关以后，麦苗长的旺盛，社员们在追肥时为了不碰伤一根苗，都先用筛子把墙灰熏土等肥料筛得粉细，再用手撒到田里。当有些麦垄上的麦苗生长不齐，社员们就用人粪一块一块的点浇，促使每个麦垄上的麦苗生长平衡。在进入拔节关时，由于麦苗粗壮，不便用锄耙草，社员们即用手和小锹的角尖把麦苗中的杂草一根根拔出来。
    为了改变地势低洼、地下水位高的不利条件，全县各地挖通了所有的河港坝头，降低河港的地下水位，所有的麦田都开挖排水沟，建立了田间排水系统，以八桥公社幸福管理区长号圩为例，这个圩总共八十六亩麦田就开挖了一百七十条排水沟。全县麦田的排水沟都开深一尺五寸左右，每一块麦田的两头都有横沟，中间有腰沟，从远处看去，构成了一个个“王”字形和“工”字形的美丽图景。大挖排水沟，使全县基本上做到“沟沟相通、河河通港、港港通江”，控制了江水进去，加速了排水。
    今年1月，扬中县曾发起力争全县实现三麦亩产千斤的竞赛倡议。事实证明，这个倡议对调动群众的积极性，夺取今年三麦丰收，起了极其重要的促进作用。虽然今年只在小部分土地上实现了千斤指标，但其所积累的丰富的增产经验，为今年三麦全面丰收打下了坚实的基础，并为今秋和明年大丰收创造了条件。
    最近，各地正在总结增产经验，也找工作中的漏洞和教训，以争取秋季和明年更大丰收。（附图片）
