　　Pickled Vegetables

　　Recently, there have been a lot of vegetables on the market. Some vegetables, such as red and white radishes, cabbage, cucumbers, hyacinth beans, cowpeas, lettuce, and green peppers, can be made into pickled vegetables in addition to being stir-fried. Pickled vegetables are made from vegetables fermented in salt water with lactic acid, and the processing method is very simple.

　　It is best to use a special earthenware pickle jar to make pickled vegetables, or a large glass jar can also be used. Add eight catties of salt to every hundred catties of water for the pickle brine. First boil the water to dissolve the salt, and after the salt water cools, put it into the jar. Then cut the vegetables to be pickled, wash them with clean water, let them dry, put them into the jar, and seal the mouth. They can be eaten after ten days. When pickling again in the future, still use the original brine. If the saltiness is not enough, you can add salt appropriately; if the acidity is not enough, you can add some wine. However, prevent raw water from entering.

　　You should also pay attention to changing the water in the vegetable jar frequently to keep it clean. Do not use oily chopsticks or other utensils when taking vegetables. If you find a small amount of mold, you can add a little shochu and ginger slices to make the mold disappear. The vegetable jar should be placed in a cool place, and eat as you pickle. Do not put the vegetables that have already been taken out back into the jar.

　　Dried Tomatoes

　　Tomatoes are the vegetables with the most vitamins and are also high-yield crops. In addition to making tomato juice, tomatoes can also be processed into dried tomatoes.

　　To make dried tomatoes, it is best to choose tomatoes that are eight or nine minutes ripe. Under-ripe tomatoes will reduce the color and flavor of the finished product, while over-ripe tomatoes will have more juice and less flesh. After slicing, the moisture will be lost, and the dried tomatoes will be of poor quality.

　　The method of making dried tomatoes is: wash the selected tomatoes with water, cut them into thin slices three or four minutes thick, then thread them with bamboo poles or branches, with a distance of five or six minutes between each slice, and then put the threaded tomato slices in a sunny place to dry for four or five days to make dried tomatoes. One hundred catties of fresh tomatoes can be dried into five catties of dried tomatoes.

　　Dried Green Peppers

　　Now is the season when green peppers are on the market. If you can't finish the green peppers you buy, you can make them into dried green peppers and store them for eating in winter and spring.

　　The method of making dried green peppers is very simple. Choose thick green peppers, remove the seeds, cut them into pieces, boil them in 5% pure soda water, soak the cut green pepper pieces in the boiling water for three or four minutes, and then dry them (it is best to avoid direct sunlight to avoid discoloration).

　　Soak them in warm water for four or five hours before eating, and take them out of the water. After half an hour, they can be stir-fried.

    抓紧时机　储存蔬菜
    泡菜
    最近，上市的蔬菜比较多，有些菜像红白萝卜、洋白菜、黄瓜、扁豆、豇豆、莴笋（莴苣）、青辣椒等，除了炒吃以外，还可以做成泡菜。泡菜是蔬菜在盐水里经过乳酸发酵以后制成的，加工方法非常简单。
    做泡菜最好用特制的陶土泡菜坛子，也可以用大玻璃罐。泡菜水每百斤水要加八斤盐，先把水烧开，使盐溶化在水里，等盐水冷却后，再放进坛中。然后把要泡的蔬菜切好，用清水洗净、凉干，放进坛子里，封好口，十天以后就可以食用。以后再泡时，仍用原卤。咸度不够，可以适当加盐；酸度不够，可加些酒。但是要防止生水入内。
    做泡菜还应注意，菜坛的水要常换，要经常保持清洁，取菜时不能用带油的筷子或其他用具；如发现少量霉花，可以放少许烧酒和姜片，使霉花消散。菜坛应放阴凉地方，随泡随吃；已经取出来的菜不要再放进坛里去。
    番茄干
    番茄（西红柿）是含维生素最多的蔬菜，又是高产作物。加工收藏番茄的方法，除了做成番茄汁以外，还可以加工成番茄干。
    做番茄干，最好选择八、九分熟的番茄。过生会减低成品的色和味，过熟则多汁少肉，切片后水分流失，晒成的干质量不好。
    番茄干的做法是：把选定的番茄，用水洗净，切成三、四分厚的薄片，然后用竹杆或树枝穿起来，每片距离五、六分，再把穿好的番茄片放在阳光充足的地方晒四、五天，就可晒成干。每百斤鲜番茄可以晒出五斤番茄干。
    青椒干
    现在正是青辣椒上市的季节，买来的青椒吃不完就可以把它做成青椒干，储存到冬春季再吃。
    青椒干的做法很简单，选择肥厚的青椒，去子，割成瓢，用5％的纯碱水烧开，把切好的青椒瓢放在开水里浸泡三四分钟，然后晾干（最好不用直接日晒，以免减色）。
    食用以前用温水浸泡四、五小时，捞出水。半小时后，就可以炒吃。
