Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd

According to TASS, Moscow, July 2nd: Comrade Khrushchev delivered a speech at the full meeting of the Central Committee of the CPSU on June 29, 1959. The full text is as follows:

Comrades! Before discussing the essence of the issues raised at this Plenum, I would like to express some views on several important issues that are not included in the agenda of the Plenum but are of great significance. We have exchanged views on these issues in the Presidium of the Central Committee and hope that the members of the Central Committee and all comrades invited to the meeting will understand these issues and strive to solve them. This refers to some problems of further developing agriculture.

The collective farmers, workers of state farms, agricultural specialists, local party and Soviet organizations have done a lot of work this year. The collective farms and state farms have successfully completed the spring sowing. Except for the Volga region and some areas in the Urals, the crops are growing well everywhere. In the past five months, the number of cattle has increased by 6.7 million head, or 15%, including 1.325 million head of dairy cows, or 10%. It should be said that the increase in the number of dairy cows is still insufficient. The number of pigs has increased by 5.5 million. The production and sale of livestock products to the state have also increased significantly.

The regions, territories, and republics are striving to complete the tasks of the seven-year plan for agriculture ahead of schedule in five years.

Improving the Level of Organizational Work

When it comes to the tasks in agriculture, it should be emphasized that we must also pay attention to the increase in grain production in the future. We have basically solved the grain problem, but only relatively so, because the urban population is growing, and the demand for grain is increasing. Moreover, we have not yet completely solved the problem of ensuring the needs of the working people for livestock products, and these problems, namely grain production and livestock production, are interconnected. Therefore, we should not neglect the task of increasing grain production.

What measures can be taken here?

First, we should complete the mechanization of grain and other crop production in the new virgin lands. It seems that more tractors, trailers, and towed implements are needed here. This is the main thing. Of course, some combine harvesters are also needed, but what is most needed are tractors and plows. Why? Because the collective farms and state farms have good crops, and the tractors are busy harvesting all autumn, so the most important work of fall plowing cannot be done. As a result, it can be predicted from autumn that the harvest next year will not be good, because it is necessary to sow on the spring plowed land. This phenomenon occurred last year in the new virgin lands. Large areas of land were not plowed in the fall, and it was plowed in the spring, and seeds were sown at the same time. As a result, the quality of sowing was reduced, the sowing period was extended, and finally, it affected the harvest. Therefore, the farms in the new virgin lands should be equipped with sufficient technical equipment so that they can harvest the crops in a short period and plow in the fall at the same time. For this, tractors and plows are needed.

It must be pointed out that we have delayed the construction of granaries, and this situation is unacceptable. When we have a bumper harvest, there will be a large amount of grain, almost several million poods of grain, which will rot and be wasted due to poor storage, and then we will have to use it for technical processing or to feed livestock. This phenomenon must be eliminated, and various granaries and other storage facilities should be established more quickly.

It is no longer possible to continue the situation where collective farms and state farms cultivate large crops, spend a lot of money on grain production, and then have to dump it on the ground. One can imagine that grain left in the open will be eaten by birds and animals, and grain will be blown away by strong winds.

I have learned about a new method of building granaries. I don't remember which designer proposed this method, but this method is very advanced. The components are produced at the construction site and can be assembled into granaries immediately with these components. If the necessary funds are allocated, then by adopting this method, the task of building granaries can be completed quickly.

Now let's talk about the issue of further developing virgin lands. Obviously, in places where there are good undeveloped lands (there are indeed such lands), these lands can and should be developed. These regions include the Krasnoyarsk Territory, Irkutsk Oblast, and other regions in Siberia. I don't know if it is possible to develop more land in Kazakhstan, where there is still a lot of undeveloped land. Indeed, there is still a lot of land there that is not convenient to develop and can be used as pastures. At the same time, there is also good land suitable for growing grain, feed, and industrial raw materials. It is also worth considering the development of new lands in the Amur Oblast and other regions in the Far East. I hope that the secretaries of the regional party committees and the chairmen of the executive committees will consider this and then make their own suggestions.

Another issue that needs to be discussed is the following. The December Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee adopted a resolution for state farms to purchase livestock from their workers and employees within two to three years. This work is currently underway, but there is no need to hasten it, nor should attention to this important work be relaxed. Everyone knows that the livestock of state farm workers is fed with the feed of the state farm, which harms the interests of the state and the entire people. From an economic point of view, that is, from the point of view of ensuring the state's demand for meat and dairy products, the livestock of workers and employees is now of no great significance. We have the possibility to fully meet the state's demand for livestock products through the socialist sector.

However, it must be ensured that the workers of state farms can fully meet their needs for meat and milk from the public production of the state farm on a trading basis. In the past, a law was passed to restrict private owners from raising livestock in cities. Later, a decision was made to lift the obligation for collective farmers, workers, and employees to deliver agricultural products to the state, which actually opened the door for using a large amount of grain to feed livestock.

The prices of grain and livestock products in our country are not coordinated. The price of grain is too low, while the price of meat is relatively high. Under these circumstances, buying grain to feed livestock is profitable, and many urban residents are doing just that. I mentioned this in my report to the December Plenum, and now I want to say: should we raise the price of grain or lower the price of meat, or should we prohibit urban residents from raising livestock? Obviously, the first two methods are not feasible. We cannot raise the price of grain, as this is politically wrong because it affects the interests of millions of working people. We cannot lower the price of meat because the current production cost of meat is high. However, we cannot ignore the fact that grain meant to supply the working people is being fed to livestock. Can we consider passing a law to prohibit urban residents from raising cows, goats, pigs, and other livestock? Moreover, goats are also enemies of plants and city parks.

Someone shouted: Yes.

Khrushchev said: Now new measures are being taken to ensure that, relying on the socialist sector, relying on the production of collective farms and state farms, the needs of the people for meat, milk, and other products are fully met. The situation where a part of the urban residents own livestock encourages unhealthy speculative tendencies. It has been proven that those who raise livestock are more likely to be those with low wages rather than those with good incomes but who want to accumulate more money. Such people will probably call us eccentric, and they will probably comment: the authorities exist, but we have not seen that we make money by feeding livestock with cheap state grain.

It seems that a measure should be taken to dispel the desire of those who want to make money from the state. Such a measure will certainly be supported by the working people.

We now have very outstanding achievements. Not only our friends acknowledge these achievements, but even those who do not like the Soviet system have to acknowledge these achievements.

We have done truly enormous work in agriculture. However, we cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. We still have many shortcomings and unresolved problems.

Comrades, what are these problems? We have not yet fully utilized the existing potential and good material conditions of agriculture. The main shortcoming is weak organizational work. Some of our collective farms produce 15,000 to 17,000 kilograms of meat per 100 hectares of land, while others produce only 200 kilograms of meat per 100 hectares of land.

This fact cannot be explained by weak organizational work, what else can it be explained by? Do not think that such collective farms are in different regions with different conditions. No, such indicators often appear in neighboring collective farms.

What is the problem, why are there such different results on the same land? The problem lies with the cadres, the organizers, the chairmen of the collective farms. Collective farms with weak chairmen, even if provided with technical equipment, cannot quickly improve their economy, but some of our leaders are satisfied with initial achievements, they say they have caught the devil by the tail, that they have caught up with and surpassed America. Another type of worker has fallen into the mire and cannot get out, but he also shouts that he has caught up with America. (Laughter)

Comrades, we should look at things soberly, correctly understand and assess what we have to do. Now, the Central Committee of the CPSU is drafting a letter to all levels of party organizations, discussing the urgent issues of strengthening collective farms and state farms with cadres, and taking measures to raise backward collective farms and state farms to the level of advanced ones. This letter will analyze the work of cadres in the collective farms and state farms of the republics and regions. However, I would like to use this important meeting of the Central Committee, attended by party activists and Soviet activists, to talk about some views on this issue here, because words spoken from the mouth are always better than the best letter.

We must strengthen the cadres of collective farms, first of all with experienced collective farm chairmen and talented organizers. The party has trained excellent cadres. We have many talented people, we should boldly promote them, and we should know how to treat them. After hearing the speech of the excellent Komsomol member, brigade leader, Gaganoff, at the Central Plenum of the workers of the Vyshnevolotsky Factory in Kalinin Oblast, many people talked to me about their great joy, and I myself felt great joy. You should understand, comrades, that you should consider that any person with a capitalist concept of life will not believe that a worker will refuse a high-paying job and voluntarily take a low-paying job, voluntarily reduce income.

However, this worker went to a backward brigade, and this was not because she lacked anything.

The nobility and excellence of this person's behavior lies in the fact that it was not material interests that drove her to do this, but the idea, the idea of loyalty to the communist system, for which this person made personal sacrifices! (Prolonged applause) Indeed, this personal sacrifice is temporary, Gaganoff herself has proven this. Our workers understand the goals that the party is striving for, the goal of building a communist society, and when necessary, they will make material sacrifices for the sake of this goal.

If a young worker can do this, then comrades, can't our activists, in terms of their level and understanding, do this: to transfer some of the most experienced people from where they are now working to where they are needed, in order to raise backward collective farms and thereby raise agriculture to a higher level.

Now, it is not necessary to generally replace the chairmen, because this will not be beneficial. But only to replace the backward ones with advanced, excellent organizers. The influence and help of society are of great significance. The current situation is that this is also understood among the people. Therefore, this must be done.

Now there is the issue of reorganizing agricultural leadership. Great work has been done in this regard in recent years. However, comrades, I want to say that we have not done a good job in organizing the management of agriculture. There is still little organizational work in the practice of agricultural agencies, party, and Soviet organizations. Comrades, this is now a major and decisive issue. We must more quickly eliminate bureaucracy. The bureaucratic method of leadership has led to the result that alongside advanced collective farms, there are always backward ones that produce only 200 kilograms of meat per 100 hectares of land throughout the year. But no one dares to touch such a chairman of a collective farm: no one praises him, he lives his own life, very calm and composed.

Leaders are ashamed of this mess, so they do not want to expose their family secrets: they do not bring them to exhibitions, they do not mention them in speeches. What can you say about such a collective farm? You must tell the truth, and this truth is really embarrassing for the reporter. So, he falls silent, and this is a clever way for those backward chairmen of collective farms.

We must reorganize the work. Once I watched a movie in which our agricultural delegation visited a company's artificial insemination station for cows in the United States. The leader of this company said: "Artificial insemination of cows - this is your Russian method. We adopted it, and we are making very good profits here with artificial insemination."

Now, in the United States, the method of artificial insemination of cows is more widely used than in the Soviet Union. We have collective farms and state farms. It seems that our leaders organize work more simply than capitalists. However, we do not organize this work here, and no one is responsible for it. There are also notices and the like. But here, what is needed is not to write notices, but to do the work thoroughly, and no one really does this.

Just take our experimental stations and agricultural research institutes, their scientific work is often detached from production needs. When evaluating the labor of research institute employees, their work is not linked to the degree of adoption in production. Ten years ago, when I came from Kiev to Moscow Oblast, I immediately went to the Potato Research Institute. It is said that the agricultural science of potatoes is concentrated here. There are scientific doctors and candidates of science working there, but the yield per unit area of potatoes was then lower than that of nearby collective farms. Who is going to adopt the achievements of this institute? I frankly told the scientists about this. A female comrade was very upset and said: "How do you humiliate us!" I replied: "If your yield per unit area of potatoes is lower than that of neighboring collective farms, what can be said to you? Should we learn from you? You should learn from the collective farms."

But these scientists live quite well, and they even receive bonuses. (The whole hall is in an uproar) Everyone thinks this is quite normal. Why? Because they are essentially not responsible for the results of applying their work to production. And these are respectable people, these are intelligent people, and the way they handle things, the mistake is not only with them.

Let us put these people in another organizational environment, so that their labor achievements are evaluated according to the scientific achievements of scientists and the specific work adopted in the practice of collective farms and state farms. For example, previously, a breeder received a bonus for the yield per hectare produced by adopting his variety.

We have many scientists who are respected and loved by the people and have talents. Just take the outstanding breeder Vasily Yakovlevich Yuryev, who recently celebrated his 80th birthday and was awarded the second Gold Star of the Hero of Socialist Labor. His varieties are used over a vast area in the Soviet Union.

Usually, those scientists who are closely connected with production achieve the greatest success. Obviously, the remuneration for the labor of other scientists should be linked to the results of their work applied to production.

In general, it is necessary to reorganize the work of scientific institutions, to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible or irresponsible. It should be organized in such a way that everyone is responsible for something, and at the same time, remuneration for their labor is obtained according to their achievements.

I said to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible or irresponsible refers to agricultural scientific research institutions. But the above words are equally applicable to our party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies. Not long ago, I went to Latvia and held a meeting with party activists, where the issue of agricultural leadership was also discussed. Latvia has about 1,200 collective farms, the exact number I do not remember. Comrade Karnabeldzhin, how many?

Karnabeldzhin: 1,220.

Khrushchev: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Latvia has a secretary responsible for agriculture. Of course, the secretary also has some assistants, because without assistants, what kind of secretary is it! (The whole hall is lively) In addition, there is an agricultural department in the Central Committee, where there is a departmental staff. The chairman of the Council of Ministers has a deputy chairman responsible for agriculture. The deputy chairman also has an agricultural group. In addition, there is a minister of agriculture, where there is also a whole set of institutions. Then there are the district party committees and the corresponding staff, and the district executive committees and a certain number of staff. Comrades, of course, it is the same in other republics and regions.

Comrades, look, if we just gather all the workers doing agricultural work, we will see that the number of workers in the republic will be like the number of collective farms, and maybe even more.

Someone in the hall shouted: More...

Khrushchev: In such a huge apparatus, many party organizations cannot choose a good chairman for a backward collective farm.

In short, as the saying goes, "seven nannies and the child is not cared for." And choosing a good chairman for a collective farm, some good brigade leaders means what? This means deciding the victory of the cause. Just here sits Comrade Orlovsky, a person respected by everyone, known to all, and not only Comrade Orlovsky, there are many like him. These people are familiar with production and are very good at organizing collective farm members. They can manage affairs well without notices.

And the directors of the factories? Do they just rely on the instructions of the chairman of the State Economic Council to eat? No such thing. The State Economic Council plays its own organizational role: it decides the plan, ensures the supply of materials to enterprises. The factory has its own work to do. Engineers, workers, foremen are all organizers, and it can be said that everything depends on them. Why are not all collective farms and state farms working in an organized manner like the entire staff of a factory? Because in some collective farms, bad workers have been serving as chairmen for a long time, one chairman has ruined three collective farms, and is now looking for a fourth collective farm. (The whole hall is lively) But the party organization rarely fights against such bad phenomena.

I will now conclude the first part of my speech. I think you will correctly understand the major tasks facing us in agriculture.

On the Basis of Technological Progress

Constantly Improving Labor Productivity

Comrades! Now let me talk about the issues discussed at this Plenum. The 21st Congress of the CPSU set forth grand tasks for the development of the economy, the improvement of the well-being and culture of the people. The resolutions of the Party Congress have raised a great political upsurge and labor enthusiasm throughout the country. In all regions, a nationwide competition to fulfill the seven-year plan ahead of schedule has been widely launched.

We have achieved good results in the first few months of implementing the tasks of the seven-year plan.

The total output for five months has been completed at 105% of the plan, industrial output has increased by 11% compared to the same period last year. The volume of completed basic construction projects has increased by 9% compared to the same period last year, and the volume of construction and installation projects has increased by 14%. The task of increasing labor productivity in industry and construction has been completed at 103%. This is also a good indicator, but if we could complete the plan task of increasing labor productivity by 105%, it would be even better.

In preparation for the convening of the Central Plenum, economic regions, tens of thousands of enterprises and construction sites have launched a competition to complete the half-year plan ahead of schedule and have achieved new production successes.

All sectors of our national economy are in a state of great upsurge. Many enterprises in Moscow, Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Vladimir, Ukraine, Belarus, and other industrial centers, regions, and republics have guaranteed to complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule through good utilization of internal potential. The guarantees of these economic regions to complete the plan ahead of schedule prove that our strength is growing, that we have great potential. This also proves that due to the reorganization of industrial and construction management, our production will develop faster. The constant improvement of labor productivity is of decisive significance for the construction of a communist society. Lenin taught that the improvement of labor productivity is one of the fundamental tasks, because without this, it is impossible to finally transition to communism. Only on the basis of technological progress can high labor productivity be achieved. Therefore, we must strive to develop science and technology, widely implement the mechanization and automation of production, and improve the cultural and technical level of the working people.

Due to the consistent implementation of the general line of the Party of Leninism, due to the heroic efforts of our people, the Soviet Union has become a powerful country with highly developed industry, mechanized agriculture, and advanced science and technology in a short historical period. Now, the whole world acknowledges these great achievements of the Soviet Union. Every day, new facts prove the achievements of our country on the path of progress.

Comrades! I think we were all very interested and excited yesterday about the flight of the Tu-114 aircraft from Moscow to New York without landing, with Comrade Kozlov on board to attend the opening ceremony of our exhibition in New York. All Soviet people were elated when they heard the news that this flight took only eleven hours and six minutes. Soviet people heard this news and were proud of our country, proud of the fact that we were the first to complete such a flight. (Stormy applause)

The issue of implementing the decision of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on accelerating technological progress in industry and construction, which is being discussed at the Plenum of the Central Committee, is of paramount importance for the successful implementation of the seven-year plan.

This is primarily the mechanization and automation of the entire production process, the implementation of automated and conveyor production lines, the replacement of outdated equipment, molds, and tools.

The purpose of these measures is to further expand industrial production and construction, improve product quality, and reduce production costs. Only through technological progress, only by utilizing the best achievements of science and technology and advanced experience, can we ensure the rapid and continuous improvement of labor productivity and the high-speed development of the national economy. This is very important for us to gain time in the peaceful competition with the most developed capitalist countries.

To achieve technological progress, we must strive to produce machines with higher productivity, persistently improve their structure, reduce the weight of machines and equipment, save metal, and use new materials.

For this, it is necessary to greatly improve design work, strengthen design bureaus and experimental bases, give creative ideas a wide scope for activity, accelerate the process of manufacturing and testing new machines, and ensure that better production equipment is used more quickly.

Here, I would like to express an opinion that it is necessary to change some old concepts. We have such a widely held view here that everyone sitting in a chair, working at a desk, is a bureaucrat, a bureaucrat. Indeed, the desk makes one deal with documents, but everyone also knows that creative workers - scientists, designers, engineers - study new scientific and technological principles in their workplace - at the desk, design new machines. Therefore, the saying that the fewer servants, the better the production is organized, is not always correct. This saying only applies to cases where production is based on manual labor, for example, field work is done with a shovel and a wheelbarrow. But now, when we use excavators and huge excavators to do this work, the ratio of workers to servants changes dramatically - servants, engineering and technical personnel are more than those working on these machines.

It is clear that it is not mechanical to call everyone who works at a desk a bureaucrat and a bureaucrat. If we pay attention to creative work to improve machines and improve production, then it will be clear that people in this area play a very important role in the development of production. For example, to establish automated production lines, it is necessary for designers and other specialists to work in the office, conduct necessary calculations, design new machines, and study new process principles after the implementation of automation.

It is clear that if we pay attention to who designed the new automated production line, then it will be clear how great the role of specialists in this area is. At the same time, we can see that the ratio between the worker operating the automated production line and the specialist who designed this line will have a very significant feature: this ratio may be one to ten; one person works in the workshop, ten people work in the office. But the people working in the office are not bureaucrats, these are creative people who create new things, master modern knowledge, and are good at applying this knowledge to production, making technology constantly advance. (Prolonged applause)

In addition to design bureaus and factory laboratories, we also need scientific institutions and research institutes; science should illuminate the way forward for engineers and designers, so that they can successfully design more perfect machines and make technology constantly improve.

In the communist era, there will be more scientific institutions, designers, and other specialists; workers, due to their rich knowledge, will also operate complex machines with high productivity. It is very important for us to be spiritually prepared for this and to guide and organize work in this direction. (Applause)

But this is the general task in the implementation of technological progress, as for the specific tasks, I would like to talk about some of my own opinions, some of which have already been mentioned in various meetings and conversations with comrades.

As mentioned earlier, the first thing to do is to improve the design work in the manufacture of new, more perfect machines. When the design work of new machines is completed and they should be put into production, the issue of how to arrange the production of various parts of the machine is of decisive significance: how to arrange this work, and what kind of machine to use to produce parts in the most economical way to speed up the manufacture of new machines.

In solving the task of improving production, casting, electric welding, or welding with flux play an important role. At this Plenum, we listened carefully to the excellent speech of Comrade Paton, who is worthy of being the heir to his father's cause, who left a valuable legacy in the field of automatic welding. He spoke very well about the significance of welding and electric welding, casting, the use of molds, and forging.

The State Economic Council and our party organizations should be more active in the actual work of manufacturing new machines and producing new machine parts.

It is necessary to seriously reform the casting production. Our work in this regard is still backward. It is necessary to seriously consider how to do it better. There are already many slogans in this regard, but slogans alone are not enough. It is necessary to actually grasp this work. Every State Economic Council must have centralized casting production, where all operations should be mechanized. Comrades, it is regrettable that we still have some foundries that are the same as they were forty years ago, where manual labor still predominates. Is this in line with the level of our modern production? It is necessary to mechanize the production of molding sand, molding, pouring, and casting processing. It is necessary to widely master precision casting, including metal mold casting, die casting, powder metallurgy, and other more advanced casting methods.

In a defense plant that I, Ustinov, and Deminchev visited together, precision castings are being successfully produced.

Someone shouted: And immediately assembled.

Khrushchev: Yes, immediately assembled without the need for mechanical processing. But at the same time, we have some foundries that are still rough-machining castings. When all our enterprises can and should utilize all the excellent achievements of science and technology, how can we tolerate such a situation!

The method of pressure processing of parts with high-frequency current is very promising. In this case, metal is not cut, and no chips are produced, but the required shape is obtained by a more advanced process. I believe that the chairman of the State Economic Council understands this clearly, but they are often busy with daily affairs. Sometimes they do not have enough strength and opportunity to arrange production according to the requirements of modern conditions, so it is necessary to help them, and we have the obligation to do so.

Welding work has a great future. Welding production should be well organized according to modern technical standards. In each economic region, there must be specialized factories whose task is to do welding work for the enterprises of the State Economic Council, complete orders in the factory or send welders to the site.

Such organization of work is necessary because the performance of various large-scale welding work requires personnel with a high level of skills and good technical equipment. It is obvious that each factory cannot have welders of all specialties. We should ensure that the welding work has a high quality, so that the welded parts will never crack. Modern welding methods can ensure this. We saw the performance at Paton's institute, where they tested the cracking of welded parts. Experience has shown that metal cracks not along the weld, but in the entire piece. It is clear that welding work can ensure high strength.

Now let's talk about the forging business. In this regard, we have not fully and reasonably utilized the existing possibilities. Five years ago, the task of manufacturing giant presses was proposed. This batch of presses was designed and manufactured by the "Uralmash" plant. However, these good machines have not been seriously utilized. Only now are some presses being installed in enterprises, while another batch of presses is not yet ready for installation, and the owners of these presses rarely consider how to put them into production faster and how to better utilize them.

Last year, I saw the installation of such a giant press in a factory. At that time, I talked about the need to better utilize this machine. And now I see a leader recording this as a new idea, so that he can say later that he is executing the directive. Comrades, there is no need to wait for any directive here, because this is a matter of taking the most basic measures to correctly utilize new technology. Important matters should not be left to chance, otherwise the situation will be that when the press is installed, it will be announced that the factory needs orders. This is an unwise, lack of initiative manifestation. It is not allowed to let the press be idle or not fully utilized. This press can produce many parts to manufacture new, more perfect machines.

Special attention should be paid to the issue of organizing the tool-making industry. Unfortunately, in many places, it is still produced in a handicraft manner. Each factory usually produces the tools it needs by itself. Without good tools, it is impossible to work smoothly. Therefore, it is necessary to take urgent measures to better organize the production of tools on a modern basis, ensure a variety of tools, and continuously and massively produce tools. At the same time, the task of improving product quality and reducing production costs should be solved.

In the organization of tool production, we have made some good decisions, but in many cases, the actual implementation of these decisions has been left to chance. The State Planning Commission and the State Economic Council should reorganize their work and strictly supervise the production of tools. I am talking about metal-cutting tools, tools for processing other materials, and measuring tools indispensable for production. At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to the production of auxiliary devices for tools.

Some comrades who spoke at the Plenum correctly raised the issue of nail products. The situation where collective farms' blacksmith shops produce horseshoe nails by themselves cannot be considered normal.

Each State Economic Council should pay attention to the issue of producing nail products (screws, nuts, rivets) locally. It seems beneficial for the State Economic Council to establish specialized factories for the production of various nail materials and mechanize the production of these factories. This factory will always accept many orders and fully operate the equipment. Standardizing the specifications of nail materials is also of great significance. Not long ago, when we visited the construction of the American exhibition in Moscow, we saw the construction of the dome of the exhibition hall. The entire dome is made of the same type of parts, which are assembled in various situations. They assembled these parts and built a dome. The method of fixing these parts is very interesting. They do not use rivets, but use the method of pressing aluminum threaded nails with an air gun. This method of fixing aluminum with aluminum is a firm and easy method of fixing. This experience is worth learning.

Our State Economic Councils must study all these issues and make their own suggestions to the State Planning Commission. This is a big and important matter, and the party organizations must take it up together with the State Economic Councils.

Decisively Oppose Conservatism,

Constantly Improve Technology

The work of our party, if it is closely linked to life, concrete and purposeful, will be invincible. The Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory that illuminates our path forward is the basis of our party's work. However, comrades, it should be clearly realized that in the era when the working class has seized state power and the party leads the entire communist construction, in order to consolidate the positions of this theory in people's minds and strengthen our state, it is necessary to make every effort to develop material production. Therefore, the issue of organizing production is a major part of our entire ideological work at this stage.

Comrades, when Marx created his theory and Lenin developed this theory, the working class did not have the experience of building socialism. There was no socialist state in Marx's time. At that time, revolutionaries could only devote themselves to theoretical research and organizing the masses to complete the revolution according to revolutionary theory, seize power, and create the real possibility of building a new life. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, our working class, guided by Marxism-Leninism, completed the socialist revolution. Now, the peoples of our country have been successfully building socialism for nearly forty-two years. By building the first artificial satellites and planets, we have been able to reach the sky. To achieve final victory, we must make every effort to develop our production and provide the builders of socialism and communism with more material benefits. (Stormy applause)

It is not right to belittle the role of our theoretical workers, but comrades, it is impossible to belittle the role of others - the builders of communism today. They are engaged in a great cause!

Today, a comrade present here wrote me such a note: Comrade Khrushchev: Why does everyone only talk about industry and no one talk about the work of the party? My dear comrade, if you do party work in a factory, and this factory produces unqualified parts, and you give a report on building a communist society in our country at this time... (The hall is lively). If you organize people to engage in scientific, higher-quality labor, will it not have a greater effect? After all, making everyone responsible for their work, proficient in their business, producing qualified parts, and assembling good machines, this is the work of the party. But you suggest that the first thing to do is to give a report on the state of people's minds a hundred years after the victory of communism. Of course, this is an excellent speech, and I do not oppose good speeches, but we might as well wait fifty years or eighty years to listen to such reports and speeches. (Laughter, applause) And if we only produce unqualified machines and poor-quality parts, then we will not be able to move forward.

Comrades! Many correct opinions have been expressed here about the issue of cooperation. I think that at present we have many irrational aspects in this regard, because cooperation itself is caused by the organizational form of the management agencies that existed at that time. A minister's factory is distributed from the Black Sea coast to the Pacific and the Baltic Sea coast. He implemented the cooperation system according to the conditions at that time. He had no other way out, because the distribution of factories under this ministry was such.

Now new organizational conditions have been created, and it is necessary to establish cooperation in another way. When reorganizing industrial management, attention was also paid to eliminating unnecessary transportation and irrational cooperation.

In my opinion, cooperation within the scope of the State Economic Council is the most rational. Of course, this is not always possible, because sometimes, for example, cooperation between Moscow and Vladivostok or Moscow and Odessa is more rational. However, this cooperation should be based on production conditions, because for some production, due to raw materials or other conditions, such cooperation is rational and necessary.

Therefore, cooperation should be carried out as much as possible within the scope of the State Economic Council or with neighboring State Economic Councils, and only that production which requires long-distance cooperation should cooperate with long-distance production. Do not be afraid of the latter type of cooperation, as long as it is rational, it should be supported.

At this Central Plenum, many comrades have spoken, and each speaker's speech is a complete and thought-provoking poem. In the discussion, many people wanted to speak, but it was not possible to let everyone speak. If comrades have prepared speeches, they can be handed over to the editorial board to be included in the stenographic record. I think it is necessary to publish the stenographic report of this Plenum, which will be beneficial to the party and economic activists.

However, if we just talk and do not ensure the implementation of the resolutions passed, then the benefits will be very few. We should organize the explanation of the Plenum's resolutions well and organize the implementation of the Plenum's resolutions.

It seems that it is necessary for every enterprise, every construction site to check its own production and output with a critical spirit based on the resolutions of the Plenum and their own opinions, and to select more advanced paths. From the factory to the State Economic Council, from the State Economic Council to the republic, from the republic to the union, do this. It may be reasonable to establish some institutions in the State Economic Council to regularly study scientific and technological issues, design new machines, and produce on the new basis of advanced technology. Although the chairmen of our State Economic Councils are all professionals, they are all busy with specific work. Therefore, establishing such institutions will be of great benefit.

Comrades, we now have many respected elders. Although they cannot work energetically all day according to their age, they have the strength and enthusiasm, and they can work beneficially for a certain number of hours each day and night. Can we consider inviting these people to work as inspectors or consultants in the institutions I mentioned above? They will certainly do very beneficial things.

Not only is it necessary to pass resolutions, but it is also necessary to establish institutions to supervise the implementation of resolutions. Perhaps it is appropriate to establish a committee of engineers, designers, and innovators in enterprises? It is appropriate to establish such a system: it is stipulated that the director, party committee, and trade union report to the party organization and workers which rationalization proposals have been adopted and implemented.

Capitalists are not always interested in further technological innovation. They often buy patents and then put them aside so as not to innovate production, because innovation requires updating capital. Capitalists have their own calculations in the economy. However, in our country, besides bureaucratic obstacles, what obstacles are there to technological progress? If a capitalist has calculations in the economy, then he should renovate the factory, but they are monopolists, and this is not beneficial to them; while in our country, there are some bureaucrats who are used to riding old horses and do not want to ride fast horses, because the fast horse may suddenly jump when turning, and it is very likely that they will be thrown off the sleigh! Therefore, such people cling to and bite the tail of the old horse and do not let go.

Who should help such people change to a lively horse, or make way for new people with creative talent? This is the party organization, trade unions, and all working people.

I do not know if Comrade Zakharkov, the director of the Saratov Gear Factory, is not here. Although this factory produced a model of a new automated lathe with 50% higher productivity than the existing machine tools as early as 1955, it is still producing obsolete, low-efficiency lathes for cutting bevel gears. Why is this? Because the production of old lathes is all arranged and settled. If new lathes are produced, it is necessary to rearrange. Since the Saratov State Economic Council can overfulfill the production plan and give the factory workers tens of millions of rubles in bonuses, including 21,000 rubles for the factory director, why produce new lathes?

You can see that Comrade Zakharkov produced obsolete machine tools, but no one corrected him, but gave him a bonus. As a result, we do not oppose those who produce obsolete equipment, and some places even reward them for this.

I ask the chairman of the Saratov State Economic Council, according to what standard did he reward the gear factory and its director? I think he cannot give a clear answer. After all, such a director should be fined, because he not only wastes materials but also uses machine tools that have already become obsolete in production, thereby causing some damage to the construction of communism. Such directors are not just one!

Last year, the grain harvest in Saratov was very successful, and the state plan was fully completed in the grain sector, but perhaps you did not do a good job in industry. You know how many bulls and milkmaids you have, but you do not know much about the machine production situation in Saratov, what kind of machines are produced. Comrades, I say this not to belittle the role of milkmaids, and I think you will not doubt this. However, those who engage in agriculture and develop animal husbandry, drink milk but do not know that to have milk, you need steel, coal, and machines, and without these, there will be no milk, and that is not possible. This bias, this abscess must be treated. In the past, the treatment of this abscess was done with folk remedies - using bran to make a mud poultice, which was very effective. (The whole hall laughs) I do not know what kind of mud poultice is needed now, bran or something else, but it seems that they are also needed in our conditions.

Comrades, think about this issue, we are studying ways to solve this problem in the Central Committee, and it cannot be allowed to continue like this.

Comrades! In our era, science and technology, rationalizers and inventors quickly create many new machines, instruments, and equipment accessories. Now, technological ideas are constantly surpassing the development of many production processes. We seem to be in a situation where there is no way out. A machine is created, and before it can be put into production, it is already replaced by a better and more perfect machine created by scientists and inventors. Perhaps some bureaucrats will say because of this: Is it not better to sleep on the old machine? After all, it is impossible to catch up with technological ideas anyway, so why rush? But only bureaucrats will think this way. Technological and scientific ideas will always surpass our design of machines and instruments, this is completely in accordance with the law. But does this lead to the conclusion that we should keep the old ways? No, we should make every effort, as quickly as possible, to adopt new machines, new instruments, and new equipment accessories, based on the rapid development of science and technology.

Comrades, if we imagine how we will use machine equipment in the communist era, then it seems that the equipment can only be considered efficient for five years, and after five years, it will be outdated. To ensure that we are always ahead in the creation of new machines and instruments, rather than falling behind, we must have very good experimental bases, and things must be well organized so that new machines can be quickly adopted. Only in this way can we truly move forward and ensure high labor productivity. To do this, we must consider design bureaus, laboratories, and scientific institutions.

Academician Nesmeyanov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences spoke here. His speech is good, and he spoke correctly about the need to better ensure the work of scientific institutions. It seems that it is time to reorganize the work of the Academy of Sciences. Take Academician Nesmeyanov, for example, he is a good communist and a good scientist. However, the organizations and institutions under the management of the Academy of Sciences are numerous and varied, so can the president of the Academy of Sciences be omnipotent? This is impossible. I think some scientific institutions of the Academy of Sciences have encountered difficulties. Individual scientists may disagree with my statement, but I believe that in the Academy of Sciences, it is not reasonable to include metallurgy and the coal industry. After all, there were no such departments in the Academy of Sciences before.

Title: Speech by Comrade N. S. Khrushchev at the Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the CPSU
Author: 
Date: 1959-06-28
Page: 2

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 28th.

Let us take the outstanding engineer and great scientist Comrade Barkin as an example. He has built the Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine, and now he is placed in the Academy of Sciences. Consequently, he has begun to insist strongly on the establishment of a corresponding institute for him in Moscow, and this is correct. The situation of Academician Shevyakov, a great expert in coal, is also similar. I know Comrade Shevyakov very well. When I was studying at the Yuzovka Workers' and Peasants' Speed School, he lectured to the university students. Before that, he worked in Dnepropetrovsk, and now he lives in Moscow.

Comrades, why, is it that in Sverdlovsk, Stalino, or Dnepropetrovsk, the development of science will be less than in Moscow? This is incorrect. Where there is life, there is science. Life cannot be separated from science, and science cannot be separated from life. What should we do? We can move the institute. But, comrades, you know, moving is like moving an old house, which is often very difficult. Moreover, experience has shown that moving scientists involves various problems.

It is better to take another path. Establish laboratories in factories, establish scientific research institutes and other scientific centers in the Councils of the National Economy, and in addition to experienced famous scientists, send more young people there. Comrades, consider these issues and then make your suggestions. I think this direction is correct.

Academician Lavrentyev has done an excellent job. He, together with other scientists, went to Novosibirsk, where a new scientific center is being established. I have known Academician Lavrentyev for many years; he is an outstanding scientist.

We must care about sending to the new scientific center those who are good at promoting science and who can help production with their labor. This is something people do not often consider. For example, everyone knows that a genetics and cytology institute is being built in Novosibirsk, and the biologist Dubinin has been appointed as the director, while he is an opponent of Michurin's teachings. The work of this scientist has not brought much benefit to science and practice. If Dubinin has some fame, it is because he constantly writes articles and makes speeches opposing the theoretical points and practical suggestions of Academician Lysenko.

I do not want to act as a judge to determine who is better or worse among these scientists. Everyone knows that practice and life are the judges. And practice shows that it supports Michurin and his successor, Academician Lysenko, in biology. For example, take the Lenin Prize. Who has received the Lenin Prize in the field of seed selection? It is the scientists of the materialist school in biology, the school of Timiryazev, the school of Michurin, the school of Lysenko. And what outstanding work has the main organizer of the opposition to Lysenko's Michurin views, the biologist Dubinin, done? His work in Moscow has not brought much benefit, and he will probably not bring much benefit if he goes to Novosibirsk or Vladivostok.

Soviet scientists have great achievements for the people. Life has presented new tasks to science. Therefore, in the future, we must continue to attach importance to the development of science and strengthen the connection between science and life. We demand that the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and its Presidium formulate proposals for further improvement of the activities of the Academy, its departments, branches, and institutes.

Firmly oppose waste and slackness, improve product quality

Comrades! The issue of improving product quality deserves special attention. I would like to read a letter that talks about the quality issues of some of our machines. This letter is written by Engineer Antilikatorov to the Central Committee of the Party. He writes:

I inform you that the full set of machines used to mechanize the cultivation of corn has the following defects:

The main beam of the frame of the "Red Star" factory's hanging-type seeder in Kirovograd is bent to such an extent that the left side is tilted to the vertical plane. The front separator is lower than the rear by ten centimeters. (Padding has been added). The gaps in the automatic stepper have not been adjusted. (Already sawed off). The crank handle on the small wheel of the automatic stepper is of unequal length, so the seeders do not open and close simultaneously. (Three to five millimeters have been sawed off). The valve stems have very long threaded ends, making it impossible to make the necessary adjustments. (Five valve stems have been shortened by one and a half millimeters and the threads removed). Four valve springs are missing. (New ones have been installed). The valve cover of one opener has been softened and placed on a tail pin. (Already straightened). Six sets of instruments have not been installed according to the markings. (Already installed according to the technical specifications). The butterfly valves do not open and close simultaneously. (Already bent and filed flat with the cam track). The seeders' material feeders have too much side clearance in the axial joint, so they cannot fall into the holes of the circular plate. (Already adjusted and the axis bent down). The tension wedges have: the brake wheel cast gear, the brake lever teeth are not filed well; the brake wheel side wall often gets stuck when rubbing against the support plate; the axis of the brake drum has a square cast protrusion in the place of the milling. (Already filed off all the tension wedges that rub against each other).

Defects of the MT3-5 Minsk tractor factory tractor:

The transmission gearbox cannot be switched to fast transmission with a lever. (The transmission box cover must be opened, and the obstacle of the locking mechanism handle must be removed). Until the fuel pump, the acceleration pull is too large. (Already adjusted). The cooling fan intake is arched. (Already straightened). The water pump cover screw cap is rolled three threads, causing leakage. (Already tightened).

All machines did not come at the same time, but were disassembled and assembled.

The tractor and seeder are now completely adjusted, tested, and put into operation.

Engineer Antilikatorov
May 22, 1959

Comrades, what is this news! Do you think this is a phenomenon? Comrades from Ukraine, is this technical backwardness?

No, this is carelessness, irresponsibility, and neglect of the interests of the business.

Please forgive me, some comrades may think that Khrushchev's speech is too harsh and rude. No, this is not rudeness! This is strict demand, because such bad work is essentially undermining the prestige of our country.

Comrades! I think we should establish strict supervision over machines leaving the factory, so that the supplied machines are complete and of high quality. Machines should have a certificate of origin, so that everyone knows who produced the parts, who inspected them, and who issued the certificate of origin. Those who manufacture incomplete products, or produce shoddy goods, or produce defective products, should be severely punished, and those who maliciously produce defective products should be subject to legal sanctions.

You know, the "Red Star" factory probably received a bonus? We have praised the "Red Star" factory. And this is not just related to one "Red Star" factory. We must declare war on the producers of defective products. We need high-quality machines and high-grade products. You know, we are working for ourselves. Even if we supply products to foreign countries, even to capitalists, we must not give them bad things. Because if so, the customer will demand compensation, and we will have to send him new parts, thus increasing additional expenses. Comrades must take all necessary measures to ensure product quality. I think we should take decisive measures to oppose those who do not value the law.

We should focus on updating equipment. I visited the Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy of the USSR, where excellent samples of various machines and mechanical devices, various excellent exhibits, were collected. In view of the fact that the Central Committee Plenum is discussing the issue of technological progress, a special exhibition hall has been set up here, where samples of outdated equipment still used in many enterprises of our country are displayed. Comrades, this sight can cause a heart attack. You know, these outdated bad machine tools and mechanical devices are made in our factories, where there are Communist Party members working. It seems that the Party organizations of these factories have also passed many beautiful resolutions, which are very pleasing, but the actual production situation is simply heartbreaking.

If we continue to work like this, we will sweat in vain, but if we change a bit and replace these machines, what great possibilities will open up before us! You know, some machines have become so old that they are like great-grandmothers. It seems that we should consider establishing a system for updating equipment. We do not have such a system now.

The newly established State Committee for Automation and Machine Building should especially study this issue. But one person cannot fight a battle alone. There should be a system, and a strict system, from the factory to the Council of the National Economy, to the State Planning Commission and the Council of Ministers.

Comrades! Now the whole problem is to accelerate our pace, because this is to accelerate the pace towards communism. As they say in the cavalry, Semen Mikhailovich Budyonny knows this very well: when preparing for a march, you should nail the horseshoes on the horses, otherwise the horses will slip. We should also nail the horseshoes on the horses, and these horses are new equipment. We should call on scientists, inventors, rationalizers, and workers to think and quickly replace outdated equipment with new equipment. We cannot slack off on this matter. After the Plenum, we will still have to grab this work more concretely. Perhaps we should convene a meeting of the Council of the National Economy, and members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU will participate in the meeting of the Council of the National Economy. We should pay attention to the issues raised, and we still have a lot of work to do. We have launched a space rocket, so why can't we quickly eliminate the shortcomings in the machine-building industry?

This also concerns the construction industry. When Kucherenko spoke here, he talked a lot about civilian construction. There are still some serious problems in industrial construction. We should not let go of those designers and industrial construction engineers who, due to their mistakes, have given us some factories that are simply astonishing. The situation with housing is also like this. There are many design drawings, but if you look closely, you will often find that one drawing and another drawing only differ in the number of decorations. But people need comfortable rooms, well-arranged kitchens, and other rooms. It is from this point of view that people evaluate the good and bad of housing design drawings.

Now let's talk about chandeliers. Such a situation has formed: when producing chandeliers, they do not think about making them beautiful, not for the sake of beautifying life, but think about making them heavier. The heavier the chandeliers a factory produces, the more money the factory earns, because the products of the factory are priced by the ton. (Laughter) So, the factory produces chandeliers weighing several poods, completes the plan, but who needs such a plan, it can light up for whom? The more the factory overfulfills the plan, the more copper it wastes, and it is not that copper is needed everywhere, black metals and wood can also be used. (Someone shouts: Plastic can also be used.)

Khrushchev: I am talking about black metals here. Black metals can also make beautiful things that people appreciate very much.

Let's talk about the situation with furniture. Many consumers sometimes do not want to buy our Soviet furniture, but look for foreign goods. Why? Because foreign furniture is more practical. Our furniture factories set plans in rubles. Therefore, it is more profitable for the factory to produce large armchairs, and such armchairs are heavier, that is, more expensive. Whether heavy or expensive, the furniture makers love to make such armchairs, always thinking that this is valuable! The plan seems to be completed on the surface, but who needs such armchairs? If ordinary chairs are made, you know, how many such chairs need to be made to complete the plan? So, the factory will consider: make armchairs or ordinary chairs? Armchairs finally won the upper hand, it is said that it is beneficial to the factory's production. And people have seen this, and there has been a lot of talk about this issue, but armchairs still have the upper hand.

Many of our machine-building products are also planned by weight, so the base seats are twice as heavy as needed, and the excess weight makes the plan completed.

We should affirm these new conditions, so that they can inspire and drive people to better organize production, design better, more reasonable samples and models.

Now let's go back to the issue of construction. Someone told me: there are three hundred standard designs for administrative buildings. What are the differences in these designs? One design has semicircular windows, and another has right-angled windows. In many cases, the difference is only this! What can be done here? This standard design can satisfy whom? We have the right to act reasonably, but we sometimes have not been able to use this right. But, comrades, we should have the determination to defeat those overly clever people. The Party Central Committees of the republics, the regional Party committees, the regional executive committees, the Council of Ministers, the regional executive committees, and the regional executive committees should treat construction work as owners.

We are quickly building houses, almost like assembly line production. I think that in a year or a year and a half, we will assemble houses like assembling cars. The prefabrication of house components and the engineer Kozlov's invention of vibration rolling are great things. For industrial construction, vibration rolling can be used to make floor slabs and wall panels. Vibration rolling must be widely used.

Comrades, I also hope you pay attention to one issue. We spent billions of rubles buying chemical and other equipment. Comrades, it seems that since we buy machines with gold, since the equipment we buy is usually something we cannot produce ourselves, or even if we can produce it, the models are outdated, then we should put it into production immediately after buying it, not letting the equipment sit idle. But sometimes the attitude towards such equipment is as follows. Billions of rubles of chemical industry equipment were bought. In the past three years, thousands of machines and instruments have been bought abroad.

In the New Kuybyshevsk oil refinery, it was stipulated to establish equipment with imported equipment to ensure the raw materials for the Stalingradsk coal factory. The equipment has all arrived, but the construction has essentially not been carried out. Due to this, it may hinder the start of the workshop of the Stalingradsk coal factory. The imported equipment for the Dnepropetrovsk tire factory has been placed since last November, and these equipment are now starting to rust, but the Chemical Committee has not yet completed the study of the technical documents. It is incomprehensible, what does this have to do with technical documents? You know, we buy factory equipment with all the process regulations.

In 1955-1956, equipment was bought in Sweden and Finland for the Kotrassk paper and pulp mill of the Arkhangelsk Council of the National Economy. These machines are scheduled to be put into production in the fourth quarter of 1961! Comrades, such facts are not few. This is a criminal act against precious equipment. Here, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the State Planning Commission, and the Council of the National Economy are all responsible. Since we have bought the equipment, we should immediately prepare for construction, and not only prepare, but also start construction, so that as soon as the equipment arrives, it can be installed immediately. Can we guarantee this? Of course, we can.

So, there will be no buying and waiting. When it arrives, what should be done? I will say it again, this is a criminal act against the cause.

Let's talk about a few opinions on the textile industry. The draft proposals of the Central Committee and the Council of Ministers have been explained in the report of Comrade Kosygin. For a period, we almost used all the funds to develop heavy industry. This is absolutely correct. And now, as the plan stipulates, heavy industry should surpass light industry in development. Now, we can develop light industry, develop the industry that produces consumer goods, without harming heavy industry. We should develop chemistry more quickly. Perhaps in those enterprises, agencies, and Councils of the National Economy that produce chemical equipment and study the development of chemistry, a promotion committee should be established.

Special attention should be paid to new businesses. Someone should be in charge, the equipment should be produced on time, the quality should be high, and the orders should be delivered on time. If the Council of the National Economy does not comply with the contract terms in the future, then we will not be able to hand over the items as stipulated. One Council of the National Economy cannot provide parts, and another Council of the National Economy cannot install machines without these parts. Accuracy, organization, and a sense of responsibility are the standards for doing a good job. A group of people should be appointed in the Central Committee to constantly pay attention to the implementation of the resolutions on accelerating the development of chemistry.

Our country has obtained many chemical products. They must be processed, and many things must be made from these products. For this purpose, it is worth buying textile machinery. We have already ordered new-type machines from abroad, but we must quickly use the machines invented by our inventors in production. We must use all new inventions. Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic have done a lot of work in chemistry, and their experience is worth using.

Modern factories must be built and the equipment of old factories must be replaced. Comrade Kosygin said that we have factories that are built economically and have ventilation, temperature adjustment equipment, and good artificial lighting. Such factories are cheaper than the factories we are building according to old designs now. We want to quickly build such factories in Moscow so that the Council of the National Economy can use it as an example. In foreign countries, old structures are no longer used in the construction of factory buildings, so they have gained a lot of benefits in terms of funds and the time of handing over the factory buildings.

I have not said once about the significance of concentrating investments. But we are still dispersing funds to many projects, and we are not considering enough how to quickly obtain products in new enterprises. Measures should be taken to ensure that construction projects are put into production on time. We cannot extend the construction period to eight to ten years.

Even if another construction project is delayed a bit, it is better, because it does not need to be proven that if we start more construction projects, this does not mean that we will obtain more products from these projects. We often delay construction and thus delay delivery. This is unreasonable. Capitalists cannot do this, because doing so would lead to bankruptcy, and we build a factory sometimes for ten to fifteen years, and we have to allocate funds to maintain a production unit with very low productivity, this is a foolish thing.

This is an expression of localism, because each unit is eager to start construction, even if it is just a little bit, look, more money will be allocated next year. Listen, who are we benefiting? For these leaders, we should pull their ears and let them see the sun, because one construction project starts, and another starts, but it is of no benefit to the country. We should take this phenomenon seriously, because it will cause harm to our economy.

It is more appropriate to delay the construction of some projects for three to five years and then complete them in two years. Do not forget that when we start construction, we should also foresee that this construction project will be completed and ended in a specific, not distant, period. If we start allocating funds for a construction project, but do not have all the necessary conditions for quick completion, then it is better not to start this construction project.

Comrade Dimshits spoke here, and he talked about the experience of building a steel plant in Bile in India. At that time, our designers completed the design work of the steel plant in one and a half to two years, and then our experts and Indians worked closely together to quickly build the factory. Our Ukrainian builders built some of the largest blast furnaces in six months. There are also some open-hearth furnaces and other important engineering projects that were built in an even shorter period. Many good examples can be cited to show that our builders can quickly and well build the most important production projects.

If everything is arranged in order, considered carefully, and prepared, then the labor efficiency of the workers will be very high, the work of all builders will be more coordinated and organized, and the construction project will proceed at high speed. This is how we should arrange the work.

Now I want to talk about the issue of saving non-ferrous metals. We have neglected this issue, but the state has spent a lot of gold, for example, to buy copper that the national economy urgently needs. As a result, these coppers are often used to make odds and ends, and the State Planning Commission even plans to produce such things. However, many things that should be made of plastic, aluminum, and other materials that are not in short supply are now made of copper. The use of rare non-ferrous metals should be restricted, and this work should be supervised more strictly. Party organizations should carefully supervise and not allow rare non-ferrous metals to be used in places where other substitutes can be used without harming the production of products. Strengthen the social supervision of the implementation of the resolutions

Comrades! The issue of the mechanization and automation of the entire production is a central issue, and in our Plenum, this issue is also a key issue. However, as long as each enterprise or construction site arranges labor reasonably, this issue can be well solved. The prerequisite for the mechanization and automation of production is the very good arrangement of the labor of workers. However, many enterprises have very serious shortcomings in the organization of labor.

We must educate workers to fully understand their responsibilities, work hard, and make their labor highly efficient, so that people strive to make full use of the working day. Working time should be spent on productive labor. The atmosphere in production should be full of this. Those who work carelessly should be intolerable. If any worker is idling and chatting, then the comrades working together with him have the responsibility to tell him directly that he is living on the hard work of the workers on the left and right.

In our enterprises, we must resolutely fight against waste phenomena, laziness, indiscipline, absenteeism, and idlers.

The mechanization and automation of the entire production, with high labor organization as a prerequisite. We must make every laborer have a high sense of responsibility for completing production quotas, improving product quality, and reducing product costs. Even under the condition of reasonable leadership from top to bottom, when the development of science and the development of constructive ideas guarantee the creation of new machines and machine tools with high productivity, the widespread use of assembly lines, and the automation of many production processes, the key position is still occupied by man, the organization of work, the accuracy of work will depend on him. Everything ultimately depends on man, because if only one person looks after the automatic line, and this person is indisciplined, then this worker will cause great damage to production, and if this worker is operating on a single machine tool, then the damage will be even greater. We should strive to make people realize this.

Therefore, first of all, there must be good discipline. We must educate the working people with the spirit of communist consciousness. In the Plenum, male and female workers, outstanding production innovators, spoke. We have thousands and thousands of such people here - young people, Komsomol members, party members, and non-party members. We must work with everyone all the time, and there are many tasks in front of our party organizations, trade unions, and Komsomol. Under the current conditions, their responsibility is to strive to make our common cause unlimitedly developed, and their work must be greatly improved.

Comrades! In recent years, the Party has taken a series of major measures to reorganize the management of industry and construction, to improve the leadership of agricultural work, and to expand the powers of the agencies of the republics and localities. All this helps to strengthen the Leninist principles of democratic centralism in management, helps to use all methods to develop the creative initiative and activity of the masses, and helps to more fully utilize the huge reserves to make various economic sectors show new upsurges, and the material and cultural well-being of the people continue to improve. These measures are of great significance for the realization of the tasks of building communism.

In addition, the Central Committee of the Party has repeatedly instructed that every effort must be made to strengthen and strictly abide by state laws, not to allow localism, to arbitrarily use investment and material resources for local needs, and not to execute cooperative supply plans.

Our cadres are trained with high consciousness and loyalty to the cause of building communism. They strictly abide by the discipline of the Party and the state, and spare no effort to benefit the people.

However, unfortunately, there are still some individual leaders of Party, Soviet, and economic organizations who violate Party and state discipline.

This is reflected in what? Let me give some examples of serious violations of Soviet laws. For example, the leaders of Murmansk Oblast arbitrarily changed the retail prices of industrial goods and grain, although they knew that they had no right to decide such issues.

Last year, the leaders of Novosibirsk Oblast cheated the state when purchasing grain. The Central Committee of the Party severely punished the leaders of Murmansk Oblast and Novosibirsk Oblast who seriously violated discipline.

It is also necessary to talk about such outrageous facts: some economic leaders did not complete the task of providing parts and materials for other Councils of the National Economy on time. Some individuals do not consider the interests of the state, act beyond their authority, as if the law is not made for them, and their principle of doing things is to do whatever they want to do.

Despite repeated warnings, the Arkhangelsk Council of the National Economy often did not complete the task of providing wood, sawn timber, and standard houses to other Councils of the National Economy. At the same time, a large amount of these materials were wasted in their own economic region.

Not long ago, the Central Committee of the CPSU exposed that the East Kazakhstan Council of the National Economy spent a large amount of funds in the past year to use the resources of non-ferrous metallurgy enterprises to carry out work that was not planned, thereby damaging the further expansion of these enterprises.

There are also phenomena of localism and violations of the procedures for supplying livestock products to the state. Please allow me to give a few republics as examples. In the first half of the year, Kazakhstan completed 111% of the meat procurement plan by June 1, but only 28% of the plan to supply the state was completed, while 95% of the plan to supply the local area was completed. In the same period, Ukraine completed 95% of the meat procurement plan, 47% of the plan to supply the state was completed, and 92.1% of the plan to supply its own needs was completed.

In the Kaliningrad Oblast, the Latvian Republic, the Kirghiz Republic, and the Uzbek Republic, there are also phenomena of violating Party and state discipline and localism.

Such phenomena of violating discipline and localism should be severely condemned, because such behavior causes great losses to the national economy.

Take the issue of collective farmers selling cows to collective farms, for example. I have talked about the experience of the Kalinovka Village Collective Farm in Kursk Oblast before. The collective farmers of this village, according to our suggestion, decided to sell their cows to the collective farm, and they themselves obtained the necessary amount of milk according to labor days. This is absolutely voluntary. The collective farmers were very happy to sell their cows because they believed that the collective farm could guarantee the supply of milk. At this time, the public livestock industry here has developed very well. After the collective farmers sold their cows, their material conditions did not deteriorate but improved. Female collective farmers were also liberated from the low-efficiency work of raising cows.

We support this direction of development of the collective farm economy, but this work must be carried out with the improvement of public livestock production.

However, some comrades in some regions have gone too far in this regard. They have not created the necessary conditions but require collective farmers to sell their cows to collective farms. A warning must be given: those who abuse their power and force orders will be severely punished, and the circumstances will be published in the newspapers.

As for those collective farms where public livestock production is very developed, the public economy can meet the needs of collective farmers for milk, and farmers sell their cows to collective farms, this is appropriate. This, I think, does not need to be proven. But this cannot be done in an administrative command manner, but should be realized through the development of collective farm production. The Central Committee of the Party has repeatedly warned that in this regard, the principle of voluntariness must be followed, and it should not be done hastily. We must create conditions so that female collective farmers will praise you, and not complain, and force them to sell cows. You must create conditions so that female collective farmers will come to you to buy their cows. Only when she sees that she can obtain the necessary livestock products by relying on the public production of the collective farm, and that she will have milk, will she do so.

Comrades! The issue of Party and state discipline is the foundation of the foundation of the activities of all cadres of Party and state organizations. Some workers, after receiving a resolution, still discuss: I will execute it if I want to, and I will not execute it if I do not want to. Such people should not have their positions. Once a resolution is passed, no one has the right to violate it. If someone disagrees with this resolution, he can present his reasons to the Central Committee of the Party, the government, or the Supreme Soviet. But before the resolution or law is changed, it must be followed, and it must be strictly followed.

We must resolutely fight against the phenomena of violating Party and state discipline, no matter in what form it appears. We must educate cadres to strictly follow the interests of the Party and the state. Comrades, if we do not do this, we will not be able to advance smoothly.

It must be pointed out that the work of the Procurator's Office has serious shortcomings. It should strengthen the supervision of the implementation of the resolutions of the Party and the laws of the Soviet state. The procuratorial organs must constantly supervise the implementation of Soviet laws.

It is possible to propose amendments to any law, but as long as this law is still in effect, no one can violate it. Lenin said in 1922 in a letter "On the Duality of Obedience and Lawfulness" that lawfulness cannot be one in Kaluga and another in Kazan, but should be unified throughout Russia, unified in all union republics.

Now, when our country has entered the period of comprehensive construction of a communist society, the public supervision of the implementation of the instructions of the Party and the government is of great significance.

Supervision work should be strengthened at all levels of state organizations, economic organizations, and other organizations. The Presidium of the Central Committee recently made a decision on this issue. I think the members of the Central Committee will support this decision. You know, the Party Constitution stipulates that Party organizations have the right to supervise the work of administration, but the Party Constitution does not clearly stipulate the specific content of this supervision, so many Party organizations have not fully utilized the right of supervision given to them. The necessity of giving this supervision an organizational form has matured. The Presidium of the Central Committee believes that it is necessary to establish committees composed of Party members and candidate Party members in the primary Party organizations of production and trade enterprises, so that Party organizations can exercise the right to supervise administrative work. These committees should constantly supervise the timely completion of production tasks, state orders, and the supply of various high-quality products by enterprises, supervise the strict observance of state discipline by all employees of the enterprise, fight against localism that harms national interests, and narrow departmentalism. They can object to administrative decisions, report illegal and erroneous acts, as well as decisions that violate laws or Party and government decisions to Party organizations and Soviet organizations. Comrades, I think it is right to do this. (Someone shouts: Right.)

Khrushchev: The Party organizations have grown stronger and more consolidated in terms of organization and ideology. Under these circumstances, there will be no danger of the establishment of supervision committees replacing the administrative organs or violating the principle of one-man management. Of course, such a committee is a burden for some people, especially for those who are particularly enthusiastic about rushing about without considering public interests. But obviously, this is beneficial to the cause.

We should always carry out criticism and self-criticism, always carry a brush to clean up the dust and dirt, so that our Party organizations, our Soviet organizations, and economic organs remain clean and full of vitality.

More closely unite the builders of communism to engage in great undertakings

Comrades! Now, please allow me to talk about some of my opinions on improving the work of cadres. We must correctly use our existing cadres. We now have a lot of cadres. But we still have serious shortcomings in the training of cadres. There is still no scientific estimate of how many and what kind of specialists are needed in various sectors of the national economy, and what kind of demand there will be for these specialists and cadres after a certain period. Because if the specialists trained by our various levels of schools are not used in the future, then this shows that our organizational work is not done well. We should consider how to plan the work of training cadres in our various levels of schools more rationally, and even if it is necessary to reduce some departments, we should not be afraid.

But this does not mean that we should shrink the work of training experts in our higher and secondary schools. On the contrary, we should do our best to develop this cause, because the more people in our country who have received higher and secondary professional education, the better production will be organized. This is very natural. But there should be a national plan to train experts proficient in technology and various sectors of the national economy.

We must better organize vocational education at home. We have done a lot of work in this regard, but we should not relax our attention to vocational education.

We should pay more attention to night schools and correspondence education, so that people can obtain education without leaving their jobs.

It should be pointed out that some places in our country have an incorrect attitude towards the work of training personnel in secondary specialized schools. Young people only want to obtain higher professional education, which is very natural. But the national economy also needs experts who have received secondary education. In enterprises, construction sites, agriculture, and other sectors, many technicians and experts with secondary technical education are needed. Such experts should be very proficient in their business, and training such experts also requires a lot of effort. Everyone knows that higher schools take much more time to train personnel than secondary schools, but not all experts use all the knowledge they learn in life. Therefore, some higher schools can train engineers while also training highly skilled technicians.

I will say it again, we should pay more attention to the training of secondary experts. In this regard, technical colleges should play a major role. We have all the conditions to expand and improve the work of technical colleges. A person who graduates from a technical college can participate in production while improving his cultural level, and can receive higher education in a night school or a correspondence school. This will be a very valuable expert who is proficient in his business. We should use all means to encourage the training of such experts.

We should also consider improving the work of enrolling graduate students. Some people are now graduate students, not because they have talent, but because they have talented mothers and fathers. This situation does not always conform to the principle of correctly training the scientific workers needed by the national economy.

We should establish such a system, that is, select people from the production posts to be graduate students, and they should have a letter of recommendation from the collective of workers, engineering and technical workers of the unit where these future scientific workers are located, so that those who have the prospect of being trained can be graduate students, and it can be believed that they will definitely make contributions after graduating from the graduate class.

Comrades, we have talked a lot about the correct combination of old and new cadres, and about the promotion of young people. Of course, we should make good use of our old comrades, but we should not let them work too long. You know, these people have done a lot of good work, they have the right, and they also have the possibility to breathe fresh air and rest in their old age. I am speaking on behalf of myself to propagandize for the old comrades, because I also belong to this group of people. But these old comrades are people who love to work. If a person has worked from childhood to old age, and now it is proposed that he should take on a lighter job, he will say: What's wrong, have I done something bad? Why should I be removed? You have done nothing bad, but let others have the opportunity to work well. But such a person will say: No, I can still work. In fact, he no longer has the energy of the past, and he can no longer maintain the necessary tension in labor. Some people can only talk, but in fact, they can no longer do much, because they lack the strength. Everyone sees this, but this person himself does not see this, and his heart is not satisfied with this. But life is life, and the law of life cannot be avoided. I understand this psychology very well. Of course, to make you agree that you should already receive a pension, to make you agree that you should return home from the bustling market in a car, not to go to the market, is not easy to accept. (The whole hall is lively, applause) Konetchuk said very well in a play he wrote about this. But when some people actually have to leave the bustling market, they still think they can only go to the market. This is not good for the work.

Therefore, for those comrades who cannot decide for themselves whether to go to the market or leave the market, the Party committee should help them make the decision. (The whole hall is lively)

We must give young people more opportunities to do more work. But what do we mean by young people? In the early days of the revolution, we regarded people aged forty to forty-five as old comrades. Now people say that people of this age are young. I think we should not forget our time. Comrades, do you remember that these issues were talked about a lot at the 21st Congress of the Party. We should solve this problem boldly and wisely.

Of course, we should not forget those who have experience and are proficient in their business, because they are very useful people, and their knowledge and life experience should be fully utilized. They can be invited to participate in the work, for example, to be inspectors and guides of various technical and economic committees. If we treat these people correctly, and it is precisely necessary to solve the problem in this way, then we can always find honorable and beneficial work for these comrades. Therefore, we can also make better use of our strength and distribute cadres more reasonably and advantageously to serve our common cause.

Comrades! The work of the Plenum is carried out at a very high level, with high initiative, and in the spirit of Bolshevik realism. This is worthy of pride and praise. I would like to talk about the content-rich reports and speeches made at our Plenum. Of course, some people's speeches have flaws, but as the saying goes, the sun has black spots. But all the speeches are good, and all the speakers have one purpose - to do everything possible to ensure the smooth implementation of the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and to show the world that the working class, which has seized power, and the working people can do what.

In fact, life is not only getting better year by year, but also day by day. We are like moving a huge granite block and using it to build the magnificent edifice of our communist society that will stand forever.

It is worth noting that even big capitalists come to our country now, and when they talk to us, they have adopted a different tone. Not long ago, I talked with Mr. Harriman. I asked him: What do you think of our seven-year plan?

"I think you will implement this plan," this American millionaire replied.

When we talked, Harriman also asked incidentally:

"What will we do next? Where will things develop?"

I replied to him: "Let us live together, arrange for peaceful coexistence. And what does this mean? We will improve our peaceful relations with your country, develop cooperation in economic and cultural exchanges, in short, peaceful coexistence!"

More and more businessmen from the United States and other capitalist countries, as well as activists and political activists from other countries, are coming to visit us. Now, capitalists have to consider the Soviet Union as a powerful factor for world peace. All this shows that they acknowledge that we have strength, not only acknowledge it, but also see it growing stronger and stronger and winning victory after victory in the face of the ever-expanding and victorious socialist world.

Now, the leaders of the Western world no longer dare to deny that we will catch up with them, and they no longer ridicule us like before, saying that our plans are unrealistic. Now they can only comfort themselves with such words: that we cannot catch up with them as quickly as planned.

When will we catch up with and surpass the United States in absolute production, and when will we catch up with and surpass the most economically developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product production? Such questions cannot be solved by theoretical arguments. From a theoretical point of view, all this has been proven. The actual solution to these problems depends on life itself. It depends on our country to guarantee the development of socialist society according to the objective laws of society.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, guided by the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, leads the Soviet people to achieve great victories and such outstanding achievements, relying on these achievements, the Soviet Union has caught up with and surpassed all capitalist countries except the United States in industrial production. We, with unshakable loyalty to this revolutionary doctrine, believe that tomorrow we will become the number one country in the world! We firmly know this, because we have laid a solid foundation for the great edifice of communism. (Stormy applause)

Comrades, we must exert greater efforts to achieve the set goals, be more courageous to criticize existing shortcomings, and show Bolshevik uncompromisingness towards existing shortcomings. Shortcomings - this is not an abstract concept, these shortcomings are manifested in specific individuals. Do not be afraid to tell your friends the truth, do not be afraid! If you tell him the truth, and he is indeed your friend, then he will understand that you tell him this for the sake of principle. If he does not understand you, then it means that he is not your friend, it means that he does not understand simple and clear things. One should not go against one's conscience. Such behavior of going against one's conscience will only bring harm to the construction of communism.

This is also a principled Leninist struggle for the victory of our common cause. So, in the organization of all our work, let us all start from this position. Only in this way can we unite people to accomplish great undertakings.

Those who flatter and fawn, who like to flatter and please certain people in front of others, will never stand firm in the Party organization. Such workers will eventually fall with those who once flattered and fawned on them.

Only on the basis of principle can we establish principled friendship between people and Bolshevik unity within the Party organization. And only such an organization can successfully solve any problem of the state and the Party. (Stormy, uninterrupted applause)

There are such people among our writers who say: How can the Party lead literature? We say to these people: Dear, how, do you not recognize the leadership of the Party? But what is the leadership of the Party? You know, this is the will of millions of people, the will of millions of wise people, the collective wisdom of millions of people. There is a writer who sits in a small dacha all day creating his sometimes morbid works. He also hopes that people will regard this work as the embodiment of contemporary people and the wisdom of the whole people. Is this not sheer individual worship? You know, it is such people who do not want to accept the leadership of the Party, which represents the will of millions of people. And such people want to stand above the Party and the people with their fictional works. Such strange people are not uncommon! Of course, this can be said to be an abnormal psychological phenomenon, and obviously, such individual prejudices will exist even in a communist society.

Comrades, I am now concluding my speech. I wish the participants of the Central Committee Plenum, the Party and Soviet workers, factory directors, engineers, scientists, advanced workers, agricultural workers, and all Party and non-Party comrades who participated in this excellent work of the Central Committee Plenum to return to their posts with new energy to implement the historic resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Party, to work hard for the people, to work for the people, to work for the cause of communism, to work for the same goal, and to merge into a great current.

Comrades! I am convinced that our Party organizations will do everything possible to mobilize the masses more widely and lead them to complete the magnificent tasks set by the 21st Congress of the Party, and to successfully complete and overfulfill the seven-year plan. This is the greatest undertaking to strengthen our country and the entire socialist camp, to consolidate world peace, and to build a communist society in our country. (Stormy, uninterrupted applause)

    为全国生产力的进一步高涨、为国民经济各部门的技术进步而奋斗
    赫鲁晓夫在苏共中央全会6月29日会议上的讲话
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科2日电：赫鲁晓夫同志1959年6月29日在苏共中央委员会全体会议上讲了话，全文如下：
    同志们！在谈到本次全会上所讨论的问题的实质以前，我想对没有列入全会议程，然而意义十分重大的几个问题发表一些意见。我们在中央委员会主席团中交换了意见，并且希望，中央委员和应邀参加会议的全体同志了解这些问题，并且尽力去解决这些问题。这里指的是进一步发展农业的一些问题。
    集体农民、国营农场的工作者、农业专家、地方党和苏维埃组织在今年作了许多工作。集体农庄和国营农场顺利地完成了春播。在全国，除了伏尔加河流域和乌拉尔一些地区以外，庄稼都长得很好。今年五个月来，牛的头数增加了六百七十万头，即15％，其中奶牛增加一百三十二万五千头，即10％。应该说，奶牛头数的增加还不够。猪增加了五百五十万头。生产和出售给国家的畜产品也大大增加了。
    各州、各边疆区和各共和国正在为在五年内提前完成农业七年计划的任务而奋斗。
        提高组织工作的水平
    谈到农业方面的任务，应该强调指出，我们今后也必须关心谷物生产的提高。我们基本上解决了谷物问题，但只是相对地解决了，因为城市人口不断增长，对谷物的需要也在增加。并且，我们还没有完全解决保证劳动人民对畜产品的需要这一问题，而这些问题，即谷物生产和畜产品的生产，是相互联系的。因此，我们不应该忽视增加谷物生产的任务。
    这里可以采取什么样的措施呢？
    第一，应该完成新垦区农场中谷物和其他作物生产的机械化。看来，应该给这里更多的拖拉机，吊挂和拖挂工具。这是主要的。当然，也需要补充一些收割机，但最需要的仍然是拖拉机和犁。为什么？因为集体农庄和国营农场庄稼种得好，拖拉机整个秋季都得忙着收庄稼，而像秋耕这样最重要的活就没法干了。这样一来，就等于从秋季就可以预定来年收成不好，因为不得不在春耕地上播种了。这种现象去年曾在新垦区出现过。大面积土地没有进行秋耕，到了春天才耕，并且当时就下种。结果播种质量降低，播种期延长，终于影响到收成。所以，应该给新垦区的农场足够的技术设备，使它们有可能在短期内收毕庄稼，并且同时进行秋耕。为此就需要拖拉机和犁。
    必须指出，我们拖延了谷仓的建造，这种情况是不能容忍的。当我们丰收时，会有大量的谷物，简直有几百万普特谷物，由于保管不好而腐烂了，糟塌了，于是我们不得不用它来进行技术加工或者用来喂牲口。必须消灭这种现象，更快地建立各种谷仓和其他贮藏所。
    不能继续容忍这种状况：集体农庄和国营农场把庄稼培植大了，在生产谷物上花费了很多资金，可是后来又不得不把它倒在地上。可以设想，粮食放在露天里，就会给鸟兽吃掉，谷物会被狂风刮走。
    我了解了一种建造谷仓的新方法。记不得是哪一个设计师提出的这个方法，但这个方法是很先进的。构件在建筑场地生产，马上就可用这些构件装配起谷仓来。如果拿出必要的资金，那么，采用这种方法，就可以迅速完成建造谷仓的任务。
    现在谈谈关于进一步开垦荒地的问题。显然，在那些有良好的未开垦的土地（的确有这样的土地）的地方，这些土地可以而且应当开垦。这些地区包括西伯利亚的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区、伊尔库次克州和其他地区。不知道能否在哈萨克再开垦一些土地，在那里还有许多未开垦的土地。的确，在那里还有不少不便开垦的土地可以用来做牧场。同时也有好的土地，适合于种植谷物、饲料和工业原料作物。也不妨考虑在阿穆尔州和远东其他地区开垦新的土地。希望各州党委会书记和州执行委员会主席考虑考虑，然后提出自己的建议。
    也应当谈谈这样一个问题。苏共中央十二月全会通过了一个决议，要国营农场在二、三年内向自己的工人和职员收购牲口。这个工作目前正在进行，但是，没有必要加速进行，然而也不能放松对这个重要工作的注意。大家都知道，国营农场工人的牲口是依靠国营农场的饲料来喂养的，而这使国家和全体人民的利益受到损失。从经济观点来看，也就是从保证国家对肉类和奶类的需要的观点来看，工人和职员的牲口现在没有重大意义。我们有可能依靠社会主义部分来完全满足国家对畜产品的需要。
    但是，一定要做到：国营农场的工人有可能靠国营农场的公共生产在贸易的基础上完全满足自己对肉类和牛奶的需要。过去，曾经通过一项法律，限制个人所有者在城市饲养牲畜。以后，又通过一项决定，解除集体农民、工人和职员的个人副业向国家义务交售农产品，这实际上又打开了方便之门用大量谷物饲养牲畜。
    我们这里的粮食价格和畜产品价格不协调。粮食价格太低，而肉类价格比较高。在这种情况下，购买粮食饲养牲畜，有利可图，而许多城市居民也正是这样做的。我在十二月全会的报告中谈到了这一点，现在我想说的是：究竟必须提高粮食价格或者降低肉类价格呢，还是必须禁止城市居民饲养牲畜呢？显然，头两个办法是行不通的。我们不能提高粮食价格，这在政治上是错误的，因为粮食价格的提高涉及千百万劳动人民的利益。我们也不能降低肉类价格，因为目前肉类的生产费用很高。但是，对于把用来供给劳动人民的粮食让牲畜吃掉这件事也不能熟视无睹。是否可以考虑通过一条法律，禁止城市居民饲养奶牛、山羊、猪和其他牲畜。况且山羊也是植物和城市公园的敌人。
    有人喊：对呀。
    赫鲁晓夫说：现在正实行新的措施，以便依靠社会主义成分、依靠集体农庄和国营农场的生产，充分保证人民对肉类、牛奶及其他产品的需要。一部分城市居民拥有牲畜的情况助长了不健康的投机的倾向。事实证明，饲养牲畜的，与其说是那些工资比较低的人，倒不如说是那些收入不坏、但想再多积累一些钱的人。看来，这样的人会把我们叫作怪人，他们大概会这样议论：政权存在着，但是，却没有看到，我们依靠便宜的国家粮食饲养牲畜借此发财。
    看来，应该制定并实行一项措施来打消那些想靠国家发财的人的欲望。这样的措施一定会得到劳动人民的拥护的。
    我们现在有很出色的成就。不仅我们的朋友承认这些成就，而且就连那些不喜欢苏维埃制度的人也不得不承认这些成就。
    我们在农业方面作了真正巨大的工作。但是，不能满足于已获得的成就。我们还有许多缺点和未解决的问题。
    同志们，这是些什么样的问题呢？我们还没有充分地利用已有的潜力和农业的良好的物质保障。主要的缺点是组织工作薄弱。我们有的集体农庄在一百公顷土地上生产一万五千公斤到一万七千公斤肉，但是，有的集体农庄在一百公顷土地上生产两百公斤肉。
    这一事实不用组织工作薄弱来解释，又用什么来解释呢？不要认为，这样的集体农庄处于不同的地区，有着不同的条件。不，这种指标往往出现在邻近的集体农庄。
    问题在哪里，为什么在同样的土地上会有这样不同的结果呢？问题在于干部，在于组织者，在于集体农庄主席。农庄主席不强的集体农庄，即使售予技术设备，也不能很快地提高经济，但是，我们的某些领导人满足于初步的成绩，据说，他们认为他们已经抓住了上帝的胡子，说他们赶上并超过美国。另一种工作人员爬进了泥潭，怎么也爬不出来，可是也叫嚷着他也赶上美国。（笑声）
    同志们，应该清醒地看待事物，正确地理解和估计我们要做的事情。现在，苏共中央正在拟定一封给各级党组织的信，谈谈以干部来加强集体农庄和国营农场，以及采取措施将落后的集体农庄和国营农场提高到先进水平等迫切问题。这封信将分析各共和国和州的集体农庄和国营农场的干部工作。但是，我想利用有党积极分子和苏维埃积极分子参加的中央委员会全会这样重大的会议，在这里谈谈有关这个问题的某些看法，因为亲口说出来的话总比最好的信还要好些。
    我们必须加强集体农庄的干部，首先用有经验的农庄主席和有才干的组织者加强集体农庄。党培养出了优秀的干部。我们有许多有才能的人，应该大胆地提拔他们，应该善于对待他们。当听了优秀的女共青团员、工作队长加加诺娃在代表加里宁州维施涅沃洛茨基工厂女工在中央全会上的发言后，许多人都对我谈到他们的巨大喜悦，而我自己也感到巨大的喜悦。你们应该明白，同志们，应该考虑到，任何一个具有资本主义生活概念的人，绝不会相信一个工人会拒绝报酬高的工作，而自愿地去做报酬低的工作，自愿地去减少收入。
    然而，这个女工却去到了一个落后的工作队，这并不是因为她什么也不缺少了。
    这个人的行为的可贵和高尚之处在于，不是物质利益推动她去这样做，而是思想、对共产主义制度忠心耿耿的思想推动她去这样做的，为了这一制度，这个人作出了个人的牺牲！（经久不息的掌声）的确，这种个人牺牲是暂时的，加加诺娃本身就证明了这一点。我们工人们理解到党所争取的目标，建成共产主义社会的目标，当需要的时候，他们就会为了达到这一目标在物质方面作出自我牺牲。
    如果说一个年青的女工能作到这一点，那末，同志们，难道我们的积极分子，按其水平和理解的能力来说，会不能作到：把一些最有经验的人从他们现在工作的地方调到需要他们的地方，以便提高落后的集体农庄，从而把农业提高到更高的水平。
    现在，不需要一般地更换主席，因为这样做不会有好处。而只需要把落后的换成先进的、优秀的组织者。社会的影响和帮助具有重大意义。目前的情况是，在人民中也了解这一点。因此，必须这样做。
    现在存在着改组农业领导的问题。在这方面，最近几年进行了巨大的工作。但是，同志们，我要说，有组织地管理农业我们做得很不完满。在农业机关、党和苏维埃组织的实践中还很少进行组织工作。同志们，现在，这是一个主要的和决定性的问题。必须更快地铲除官僚主义。官僚主义的领导方法造成了这样的结果：与先进集体农庄并列，终年存在着落后的、每百公顷土地只生产两百公斤肉的集体农庄。但是，谁也不去碰这样的集体农庄主席：没有人夸奖他，他自己过自己的生活。十分泰然自若。
    领导人对这摊子混乱工作感到惭愧，因此，他们的家丑不便外扬：在展览会上不拿出来，在讲话中也不提。关于这样的集体农庄你能说些什么呢？必须讲实情，而这种实情真使报告人自己难堪。于是，他沉默起来，而这对那些落后的集体农庄主席来说，真是高明的办法。
    我们应该改组工作。有一次我看了一部电影，其中介绍我国农业代表团到美国一家公司的牛的人工授精站。这家公司的领导人说：“人工授精胎——这是你们俄国人的方法。我们采用了，在这里搞人工授精，收到很大利润”。
    现在在美国，牛的人工授精法比苏联更为推广。我们有集体农庄和国营农场。看来，我们的领导人组织工作比资本家更简单。但是，我们这里根本没有组织这个工作，对这件事情谁也不负责任。也有通告之类的东西。但是，这里需要的不是写通告，而是把工作做得彻底，而这一点却没有一个人真正来做。
    就拿我们一些实验站和农业科学研究所来说，它们的科学工作常常脱离生产需要。评价研究所工作人员的劳动时，没有结合他们的工作在生产中采用的程度。十年以前，当我从基辅来到莫斯科州时，马上就到了马铃薯作物科学研究所。据说，这里集中了马铃薯作物方面的农业科学之花。那里有科学博士和副博士在工作，可是马铃薯的单位面积产量当时比附近的集体农庄还要低。试问，究竟有谁来采用这个研究所的成就呢？我坦率地对科学家们说到了这一点。有一位女同志很沮丧地说：“您怎么这样羞辱我们！”我回答说：“如果你们的马铃薯单位面积产量是比邻近的集体农庄还低，那可以对你们说什么呢。难道要向你们学习吗？你们要向集体农庄学习才对”。
    可是这些科学家们生活得不坏，甚至还得到奖金。（全场跃进）这一点大家都认为很正常。为什么？因为他们实质上没有对把他们的工作运用到生产的结果负责。而这是一些值得尊敬的人，这是些聪明的人，这样处理事物，过错不仅仅在于他们。
    让我们把这些人放在另一种组织环境里，使他们的劳动成绩根据科学家的科学成就和具体工作在集体农庄和国营农场实践中采用的情况而评定。例如以前，有一个选种家是由于采用他的品种每公顷地所生产的产量而得到奖金的。
    我们有许多博得人民尊敬和爱戴的有才能的科学家。就拿杰出的选种家瓦西里·亚科夫列维奇·尤里耶夫来说，他前几天过八十岁寿辰，荣获了第二枚社会主义劳动英雄的金质奖章。他选出的品种在苏联很大的面积上使用。
    通常是，那些同生产密切联系的科学家往往取得最大的成就。显然，对其他科学家的劳动报酬应该同他们的工作运用到生产中去的结果联系起来。
    总而言之，必须改组科学机关的工作，消灭无人负责或不负责任的现象。应该这样来组织科学工作：使每个人都对某一件事情负责，同时根据他的成绩取得自己劳动的报酬。
    我说消灭无人负责或不负责任的现象是指农业科学研究机关而言。但是以上这些话同样适应于我们的党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机构。不久前我曾经到过拉脱维亚，同党积极分子举行了座谈，会上也讨论了有关农业领导问题。拉脱维亚好像有一千二百个集体农庄，确切数目我记不清了。卡恩别尔津同志，有多少呀？
    卡恩别尔津：一千二百二十个。
    赫鲁晓夫：拉脱维亚共产党中央委员会有一位负责农业的书记。当然，书记还有一些助手，因为没有助手哪能算什么书记呀！（全场活跃）此外，在中央委员会又有一个农业部，这里有部的编制。部长会议主席有一位专管农业的副主席。副主席也有一个农业组。此外还有农业部长，那儿也有一整套机构。再就是区党委会和相应的编制人员，还有区执行委员会和一定的编制人员。同志们，在其它共和国和州内当然也是这样。
    同志们，你们看，如果我们光是把做农业工作的工作人员集合在一起，我们就会看到，共和国的这种工作人员就会像集体农庄一样多，而且也许更多一些。
    会场上有人喊：更多一些……
    赫鲁晓夫：就在这样庞大的机构中，许多地方的党组织却不能为落后的集体农庄选择出好的主席来。
    总之，就像俗语说的“七个保姆孩子无人管”。而选择一位好的集体农庄主席，一些好的生产队长意味着什么呢？这意味着决定事业的胜利。正好这里坐着奥尔洛夫斯基同志，他是一位受大家尊敬的，家喻户晓的人，而且不仅奥尔洛夫斯基同志一个人，像他这样的人有很多。这些人熟悉生产，在组织集体农庄庄员方面很有办法。他们不用通告也可以顺利地管理好事务。
    而各工厂厂长呢？难道他们光靠国民经济委员会主席对他们的指示吃饭吗？没有这样事。国民经济委员会起它自己的组织作用：决定计划，保证企业的物资供应。工厂有自己的活干。工程师、工人、工长都是组织者，也可以说一切都取决于他们。为什么不是所有的集体农庄和国营农场都像工厂全体职工那样有组织地工作呢？因为，在某些集体农庄里，坏的工作人员长期地担任着主席的职务，有一位主席把三个集体农庄搞垮了，现在正在物色第四个集体农庄（全场活跃）。可是，党组织很少同这些坏现象进行斗争。
    我现在结束我发言的第一部分。我想你们会正确地了解摆在我们面前的农业方面的重大任务。
    在技术进步的基础上
    不断提高劳动生产率
    同志们！现在让我谈谈这次全会所讨论的问题。党的第二十一次代表大会提出了发展经济、提高人民福利和文化的宏伟任务。党代表大会的决议掀起了巨大的政治高潮和劳动热情。在全国各地，广泛地展开了争取提前完成七年计划的全民竞赛。
    我们在执行七年计划任务的头几个月中取得了良好的成绩。
    五个月的总产值计划完成了105％，工业产量比去年同期增加了11％。已完成的基本建设工程量比去年同期增加了9％，而建设安装工程量增加了14％。工业和建筑业的劳动生产率增长任务完成了103％。这也是很好的指标，但是，如果在劳动生产率的增长方面，我们能完成计划任务的105％，那当然就更好了。
    为迎接中央全会的召开，各经济区、成千上万的企业和建筑工地展开了提前完成半年计划的竞赛并且取得了新的生产成就。
    我国国民经济的一切部门都处于巨大的高涨中。莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、弗拉基米尔、乌克兰、白俄罗斯和其他工业中心、州和各共和国的很多企业都保证通过很好地发挥内部潜力的办法来提前完成七年计划。这些经济区提前完成计划的保证证明了我们的力量在增长，证明我们有巨大的潜力。这同时也证明，由于改组工业和建筑业的管理，我们的生产将发展得更快。劳动生产率的不断提高对建成共产主义社会有决定性的意义。列宁曾教导说，劳动生产率的提高是根本任务之一，因为不做到这一点，便不能最后过渡到共产主义。只有在技术进步的基础上，才能达到高度的劳动生产率。因此，我们必须全力发展科学技术，广泛实行生产的机械化和自动化，提高劳动人民的文化技术水平。
    由于始终如一地贯彻了党的列宁主义总路线，由于我国人民的英勇努力，苏联在短短的历史时期内已经变成了一个有高度发展的工业，机械化的农业和先进的科学技术的强国。现在，全世界都承认苏联的这些伟大的成就。每天都有新的事实证明我国在前进道路上的成就。
    同志们！我想，我们大家昨天都是怀着莫大的兴趣和激动的心情关怀着“图—114”飞机不着陆从莫斯科一直飞往纽约的这件事，科兹洛夫同志乘坐这架飞机前去参加我国在纽约举办的展览会的开幕式。全体苏联人民听到这次飞行总共只用了十一小时零六分的消息后，莫不欢欣鼓舞。苏联人听到这个消息后都为我们的国家、为我们第一个完成这种飞行而感到自豪。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    党中央委员会全体会议所讨论的贯彻苏共第二十一次代表大会关于加速工业和建筑业中的技术进步的决定这一问题，对顺利完成七年计划有着头等重要的意义。
    这首先是生产的全盘机械化和自动化，实行自动、流水作业线，更换过时的设备、压模和工具。
    这些措施的目的是：进一步扩大工业生产和工业建设，提高产品质量以及降低产品成本。只有通过技术进步、只有利用科学技术的优良成就和先进经验，才能保证劳动生产率的迅速不断的提高和国民经济的高速度发展。为了在同最发达的资本主义国家的和平竞赛中赢得时间，这对我们是十分重要的。
    为了技术进步，我们必须争取生产具有更高生产效能的机器，坚持不懈地使这些机器的结构更趋完善、减轻机器和设备的重量、节约金属、采用新材料。
    为此，必须大力改进设计工作、加强设计局和实验基地、给创造性的思想以广阔的活动天地、加速制造和试验新机器的过程、保证把更好的生产设备更快地运用到生产中去。
    谈到这里，我想谈一点意见，就是有必要改变某些旧概念。我们这里有这样一种广泛流行的看法，认为每一个坐在椅子上，在办公桌旁进行工作的人都是文牍主义者，官僚主义者。不错，办公桌使人同公文打交道，但是，大家也知道，从事创造性工作的人——科学家，设计师，工程师却在他们工作的地方——办公桌上研究出新的科学技术原理，设计出新的机器。因此，认为服务人员愈少，生产便组织得愈好，这种说法并不永远是正确的。这种说法只适用于这样的情况下：生产是建立在手工劳动的基础上，例如，田间的工作是借助铁铲和手推车来进行。而现在，当我们用挖土机和巨大的挖掘机来进行这些工作的时候，工人和服务人员之间的对比关系就发生了剧烈的变化——服务人员，工程技术人员比在这些机械上工作的人要多。
    可见，不能机械地把一切坐在办公桌旁劳动的人都称作文牍主义者和官僚主义者。如果注意到为改进机器和改善生产而进行的创造性工作，那么，就会明白，在这方面进行工作的人在发展生产中起着十分重大的作用。譬如说，为了建立自动化作业线，就必须有设计师和其他专家在办公室工作，进行必要的计算，设计新的机器，研究实行自动化后新的工艺规程原则。
    可见，如果注意研究一下，是谁设计了新的自动化作业线，那末就会明白，专家在这方面的作用是多么大。同时我们可以看到，操纵自动化作业线的工人和设计这个作业线专家之间的比例将有很大的特点：这个比例可能是一比十；一个人在车间工作，十个人在办公室工作。但是，在办公室里工作的人决不是官僚主义者，这是一些创造性的人，他们创造新的东西，掌握现代的知识，善于把这些知识运用到生产中去，使技术不断前进。　（经久不息的掌声）
    除了设计局和工厂试验室以外，我们还需要科学机构和科学研究所，科学应该为工程师和设计师照亮前进的道路，使他们能够胜利地设计出更完美的机器，使技术不断改进。
    在共产主义时代，将有更多的科学机关、设计师和其他专家；工人由于具有丰富的知识，也将操纵高生产率的复杂的机器。作好这方面的精神准备对我们来说是很重要的，正应该朝这个方向指导和组织工作。（掌声）
    但是，这是实现技术进步方面的总任务，至于说到具体任务，我想谈一谈我自己的一些意见，其中有些看法已经在各次会议上和跟同志们谈话中讲过了。
    前面已经指出，首先应该是在制造新的，更为完善的机器方面的设计工作。当新机器的设计工作已经完成而应该投入生产的时候，具有决定意义的是如何安排机器各个部件的生产的问题：怎样安排这一工作，为了加速制造新机器，用什么样的机器来制造部件最为节省。
    在解决改进生产的任务时，铸造、电焊或用助熔剂焊接起着重要作用。在这次全会上，我们仔细地听了帕顿同志卓越的发言，他不愧为他父亲的事业的继承者，他的父亲在自动焊接方面留下了宝贵的遗产。他很好地谈到了焊接和电焊、铸造、使用压模的意义，以及锻压业务。
    国民经济委员会和我们的党组织应该更积极地过问制造新机器，生产新机器部件的实际工作。
    应该认真地改造铸造生产，我们这一方面的工作还是落后的。应该深入地考虑怎样做更好。这一方面的口号已经很多，但是仅仅一些口号是不够的。必须从实际上抓这件工作。每一个国民经济委员会都必须有集中的铸造生产，其中全部操作都应当是机械化的。同志们，很遗憾，目前我们还有些铸造厂跟四十年前一样，手工劳动仍然占优势。难道这符合我们现代生产的水平吗？应该使制造型砂、造型、浇注以及铸件加工等全部机械化。应该广泛掌握精密铸造，其中包括金属型铸、压铸、粉末冶金和其他更为完善的铸造法。
    在我和乌斯季诺夫以及杰明捷夫同志一同参观过的一个国防工厂里正在成功地生产精密铸件。
    有人喊：而且是立即拿去装配。
    赫鲁晓夫：是的，立即拿去装配而不必经过机械加工。但同时我们有些铸造厂却在进行铸件的粗加工。当我们的所有企业都能够而且应该利用科学和技术的一切卓越成就的时候，怎么能容忍这种情况呢！
    用高频率电流压力加工制件的方法是很有前途的。在这种情况下金属不用切削，也不产生切屑，而是用更完善的工艺规程得到所需要的形状。
    我相信，国民经济委员会主席清楚地了解这一点，但是他们常常忙于日常事务。他们有时没有足够的力量和机会把生产安排得合乎现代条件的要求，因此，需要帮助他们，而我们有义务这样做。
    焊接工作有很大的前途。焊接生产应该按照现代技术水平很好地加以组织。在每个经济地区必须有专业化工厂，它们的任务是给国民经济委员会各企业做焊接工作，在厂内完成订货或派焊工到现场去。
    这样组织工作是有必要的，因为进行各种大规模的焊接工作要求干部有很高的水平和要有良好的技术装备。很明显，每个工厂不可能各自具有各方面专业的电焊工。我们应该保证电焊工作有很高的质量，要使焊接起来的部件的焊缝永远不会裂开。现代的焊接法可以保证做到这点。我们参观帕顿的研究所时看到了那里的表演，他们在试验使焊件裂开。经验证明，金属裂开不是沿着焊缝，而是在整个一块地方裂开。可见，焊接工作可以保证高度牢固性。
    现在谈一谈锻压业务。在这方面我们远没有完全和经常合理地利用现有的可能性。五年前就提出了制造巨型压力机的任务。这批压力机是由“乌拉尔机器工厂”设计和制造的。但是，这批很好的机器并没有认真地利用。直到现在才在企业中安装一些压力机，而另一批压力机到现在还没有准备好安装地点，而这些压力机的主人也很少考虑如何更快地把它们投入生产和如何更好地利用它们。
    去年，我在一个工厂里看到了这种巨型压力机的安装情况。当时我就谈到必须更好地利用这个机器。而现在我看到一个领导干部正在把这件事当作新鲜主意记下来，以便过些时候可以说，他正在执行指示。同志们，这里不必等待任何指示，因为这是采取最起码的措施来正确利用新技术的问题。对重要的事情不能听任自流，否则就会产生这种情况：等到压力机装好了，然后宣布，工厂需要订货。这是一种不明智的，缺乏主人翁态度的表现。不能允许压力机窝工或者没有充分利用。这台压力机能够生产很多的部件，来制造新式的、更完善的机器。
    应该特别注意关于组织工具制造业的问题，遗憾的是，在很多地方它还是手工业式地生产。每个工厂照例自己生产它所必需的工具。没有好工具就不可能顺利地工作。正因为如此，必须采取迫切的措施在现代化方法的基础上更好地组织工具的生产、保证品种繁多、保证大批地、不断地制造工具。同时，还要解决提高产品质量和降低产品成本的任务。
    在组织工具生产方面我们有些很好的决定，但是，在很多场合下，这些决定的实际执行情况陷于自流。国家计划委员会、国民经济委员会应当改组自己的工作，毫不放松地监督工具的生产。我讲的是金属切削工具、其他材料的加工工具、以及生产所不可缺少的量具。同时应该关心工具所需的辅具装置的生产。
    在全会上发言的一些同志正确地提出了关于钉类制品的问题。由集体农庄的铁工厂自己制造马掌钉的情况，不能认为是正常的。
    各国民经济委员会应该关心就地生产钉类制品（螺钉、螺帽、铆钉）的问题。对各国民经济委员会来说，建立生产各种钉类材料的专业工厂并使这种工厂的生产机械化，看来是有好处的。这个工厂将总是会接受很多订货而充分开动设备。划一钉类材料的规格也有很大的意义。不久前在参观莫斯科的美国展览会的建筑时，我们看到了展览馆圆屋顶的施工情况。整个屋顶是用同型的零件建成的，这些零件是在各种不同的情况下装配好的。他们把这些零件配在一起，就搭成了一个圆屋顶。这些零件的固接方法，是很有意思的。他们不用铆钉，而是使用风动机压入铝制螺纹钉的办法。这种以铝加固铝的方法是一种牢固而轻易的固接方法。这个经验值得学习。
    我们各国民经济委员会必须研究所有这些问题，并向国家计划委员会提出自己的建议。这是一件重要的大事，党组织必须和国民经济委员会一道把它承担起来。
        坚决反对保守主义，
    经常不断地改善技术
    我们党的工作如能密切联系生活、具体而有鲜明的目的性，那么它就会是无往而不利的。照耀着我们前进道路的马克思列宁主义革命理论，是我们党的工作的依据。但是，同志们，应该清楚地意识到，在工人阶级掌握国家政权、党领导着整个共产主义建设事业的今天，为了在人们的意识中巩固这种理论的阵地，为了加强我们的国家，就应该尽全力发展物质生产。因此，组织生产的问题是现阶段我们整个思想工作中的一个重大的部分。
    同志们，当马克思创造自己的理论和列宁发展这个理论的时候，工人阶级还没有建设社会主义的经验。在马克思的时代还没有社会主义国家。当时的革命者不得不只是致力于理论研究和组织群众，以便依据革命理论来完成革命，夺取政权，并为建设新生活创造现实的可能性。在共产党领导下的我国工人阶级，遵循着马克思列宁主义的指导，完成了社会主义革命。现在，我国各族人民顺利建设社会主义已将近四十二年。由于建造了第一批人造卫星和人造行星，我们已经力可攀天了。为了取得最后胜利，我们必须尽全力发展我国生产，使建设社会主义和共产主义的人们以享有更多的物质福利。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    贬低我国理论工作者的作用是不行的，但是，同志们，无论怎样也不能贬低其他人——共产主义今天的锻造者的作用。他们在从事着伟大的事业！
    今天在座的一位同志给我写了这样一个条子：赫鲁晓夫同志：为什么所有的人都只谈工业而没有一个人讲讲党的工作呢？我亲爱的同志，假如您在一个工厂作党的工作，这个工厂生产的零件不合规格，而您这时候却来作关于在我国建立共产主义社会的报告……（会场活跃）。假若您去组织人们从事科学的、质量更高的劳动，岂不会有更大的效果吗？要知道，使每个人都对自己的工作负责、精通自己的业务、生产出合规格的零件、装配出很好的机器，这就是党的工作。可是您建议摆在首要地位的，却是作一个报告来谈论在共产主义胜利一百年之后，人的思想状况如何如何。不错，这是一篇精采的演说，您也别认为我反对好的演说，不过我们不妨等五十年或者八十年以后再去听这一类的报告和演讲吧。（笑声、掌声）而假如我们只是生产不合规格的机器和质量不好的零件，那么我们是前进不了的。
    同志们！关于协作问题这里已经讲了许多正确的意见。我认为，目前在这方面我们有许多不合理的地方，因为协作本身是由当时存在的管理机构的组织形式引起的。一个部长所属的工厂从黑海沿岸一直分布到太平洋和波罗的海沿岸。他是按照当时的条件来实行协作制的。他没有别的出路，因为这个部所属的工厂分布情况是如此。
    现在创造了新的组织条件，因而必需按照另外的方式来建立协作。在实行工业管理改组时，也注意到消除不必要的运输和不合理的协作。
    在我看来，在国民经济委员会的范围内进行协作是最合理的。当然，这不是经常能够做到的，因为有时，譬如，举例说，莫斯科和海参崴或者莫斯科和敖德萨之间的协作更合理些。但是，这种协作需要根据生产情况而定，因为对于某些生产来说由于原料或其他一些条件，进行这种协作是合理的和必需的。
    因此，应当尽可能在国民经济委员会范围内或同邻近的国民经济委员会进行协作，只有那种要求远距离协作的生产才应当同远距离的生产进行协作。不要害怕这后一种协作，只要它是合理的，就应当支持。
    在这次中央全会上，有许多同志发了言，而且每个发言人的讲话，都是富有思想的完整的诗篇。在讨论中，有许多人要求发言，但是没有可能让所有的人都发言。如果同志们有准备好了的发言稿，可以交给编委会，以便附入速记记录。我想，应该印发这次全会的速记报告，这对我们党和经济方面的积极分子是有益处的。
    但是，如果我们是谈谈而已，不去在组织上保证完成所通过的决议，那么益处将是很少的。我们应该很好地组织对全会决议的解释工作和组织执行全会决议的工作。
    看来，需要每一个企业、每一个建筑工地的全体工作人员根据全会的决议和自己的意见，用批评的精神来检查自己的生产和产量，选定更先进的途径。从工厂到国民经济委员会，从国民经济委员会到共和国，从共和国到全联盟都这样做。可能，在国民经济委员会建立某些机构以便经常研究科学技术问题、设计新机器问题，以及在利用先进技术的新基础上进行生产等问题，是合理的。虽然我们国民经济委员会的主席都是内行，但是他们都忙于具体工作。因此，建立这样的机构会有很大的好处。
    同志们，我们现在有很多德高望众的人，虽然按照他们的年龄来说不可能整天精力充沛地工作，但是，他们有力量和热情，他们每昼夜能有一定的时间用来作出有益的工作。可否考虑吸收这些人到我上面所说的机构中去作检查员或顾问等工作呢？肯定的说，他们会作出非常有益的事来。
    不仅需要通过决议，而且需要建立对执行决议的监督机构，也许应该在企业中建立工程师、设计师和创造者的协进委员会？建立这样的制度是适宜的：规定由厂长、党委会和工会向党组织和工人报告，提出了哪些合理化建议，其中哪些建议采纳了和实现了。
    资本家对技术的进一步革新并不经常感到兴趣，他们经常收买发明权，然后把它丢在一旁，为的是不去革新生产，因为革新生产需要更新资本。资本家在经济方面有自己打算。但是，在我们这里除了官僚主义方面的障碍之外，对技术进步还有什么障碍呢？假如资本家在经济方面有打算的话，那末他应该改革厂房，可是他们是垄断资本家，这对他们不利；而在我们这里有一些官僚主义者习惯乘衰老的马，他们不愿改乘骏马，因为骏马可能在转弯时突然急跳，很可能把他们从雪橇上甩下来！因此这样的人就抓住和死咬住老马的尾巴不放。
    谁应该帮助这种人改乘有生命力的马，或者使他们让位给具有创造天才的新人呢？这就是党组织、工会和全体劳动人民。
    我不知道萨拉托夫切齿机工厂厂长扎哈洛夫同志在不在这里。这个工厂虽然早在1955年就制造过比已生产的机床的生产效能高50％的新的自动化的车床模型，但是现在仍然生产陈旧的效率低的切削伞形齿轮的车床，为什么会这样呢？因为生产旧的车床一切都安排好了，料理好了，如果生产新的车床，就要重新安排。既然超额完成萨拉托夫国民经济委员会的生产计划可以发给工厂工作人员几十万卢布的奖金，其中有工厂厂长二万一千卢布的奖金。那么为什么要生产新车床呢？
    你们可以看到，扎哈罗夫同志生产了过时的机床，却谁也没有去纠正他，反而给了他奖金。结果是我们不反对那些生产过时设备的人，某些地方甚至为此奖励他们。
    请问萨拉托夫国民经济委员会主席，按照什么标准奖励了切齿机床厂和他的厂长？我想他提不出明确的回答。要知道，这样的厂长应该扣工资，因为他不仅糟塌物资，而且把无形中已经陈旧的机床用于生产，从而对共产主义建设带来了某种损失。这样的厂长岂只一个！
    去年萨拉托夫人谷物收获的成绩很出色，在谷物方面十分圆满地完成了国家的计划，但是，大概你们没有好好从事工业。你们知道，你们有多少牡犊和多少挤乳女工，但是你们却不大知道萨拉托夫的机器生产情况怎样，生产些什么机器。同志们，我这样说，并不是要贬低挤乳女工的作用，我想你们也不会怀疑到我这一点。但是，从事农业和发展畜牧业的人，喝牛奶而不知道要有奶就需要钢铁、煤和机器，没有这些就不会有奶，那样是不行的。这种偏颇、这种龈脓肿必须治疗。过去治疗这种龈脓肿是采用民间的方子——用麸子做成泥罨剂，很有效。（全场大笑）我不知道现在需要怎样的泥罨剂，是用麸皮呢还是用其他的东西，但是，看来，在我们的条件下也需要它们。
    同志们，想一想这个问题吧，我们正在中央委员会研究解决这个问题的办法，不能让它这样下去。
    同志们！在我们生活的时代里，科学和技术、合理化建议者和发明家迅速地创造出许多新的机器、仪器和设备附件。现在，技术思想不断超过许多生产过程的发展。我们好像处于无法可想的境地。一种机器创造出来，还来不及投入生产，就已经被科学家和发明家创造出来的更好更完善的机器所代替了。可能某些官僚主义者会因此这样说：在旧机器上睡大觉不是更好吗？反正无论如何也赶不上技术思想，又何苦匆匆忙忙呢。但是，只有官僚主义者才会这样想。技术和科学思想总是超过我们设计机器和仪器的工作，这是完全合乎规律的。但是，难道就由此得出结论，说我们应当保留老一套吗！不，我们现在应当根据科学技术的急剧发展，作尽一切努力，尽快地采用新机器、新仪器和新的设备附件。
    同志们，如果设想一下我们在共产主义时代如何使用机器设备的情景，那么，看来，设备只能在五年之内算是效率高的，一过五年就过时了。为了保证在创造新机器和仪器方面总是走在前头而不是落后，就必须有非常好的实验基地，把事情弄得井井有条，以便很快地采用新机器。只有在这种情况下，我们才能真正地向前发展和保证高度的劳动生产率。为了做到这一点，须要考虑的仍然是设计局、实验室和科学机关。
    苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫同志在这里发了言。他的发言很好，关于必须更好地保证科学机关的工作方面，谈得很正确。看来，改组科学院的工作也是时候了。就拿涅斯米扬诺夫同志来说，他是一个好的共产党员和好的科学家。但是科学院管理之下的组织和机关形形色色，不计其数，那末，科学院院长难道可能是万能的吗？这是不可能的。我想，科学院的某些科学机关遇到了困难情况。个别的科学家可能不同意我的说法，但是，我认为，在科学院中包括冶金和煤炭工业问题是不合理的。须知，从前科学院中没有这些部门。
    就拿卓越的工程师和大科学家巴尔金同志来说吧。他曾建设过库兹涅茨克联合工厂，而现在把他安置在科学院。于是他开始极力要求在莫斯科给他建立一个相应的研究所，这也是正确的。煤炭方面的大专家谢维雅科夫院士的情况也差不多如此。我很了解谢维雅科夫同志，当我在尤佐夫克工农速成中学学习的时候，他给大学生们讲课，在这以前，他在第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克工作，现在他住在莫斯科。
    同志们，为什么，难道在斯维德洛夫斯克、斯大林诺或第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克，科学的发展就会不如莫斯科吗？这是不对的。哪里有生活，哪里就有科学。生活不能脱离科学，科学也不能脱离生活。怎么办呢？可以把研究所迁走。但是，同志们，你们知道，搬家好像把一幢老房子搬走一样，这往往是很难办的。此外，经验证明，科学家的搬家还牵涉到各种各样问题。
    最好走另一条路。在工厂中建立实验室，在国民经济委员会建立科学研究所和其他科学中心，除了有经验的著名科学家以外，还可以派更多的青年到那里去。同志们，请考虑一下这些问题，然后提出自己的建议。我想，这个方向是正确的。　（掌声）
    拉夫连捷夫院士做了件出色的事情，他同其他科学家一起到现在正在建立新的科学中心的新西伯利亚去。我认识拉夫连捷夫院士许多年了，他是一位优秀的科学家。
    我们应当关心给新的科学中心调派那些善于推动科学前进和善于用自己的劳动给生产以必要帮助的人。这一点是人们没有经常考虑到的。例如，大家知道，新西伯利亚正在建设一所遗传学和细胞学研究所，任命生物学家杜比宁担任所长，而他是米丘林学说的反对者。这位科学家的工作没有给科学和实践带来多大好处。如果说杜比宁有点名气的话，那是因为他不断写文章、发议论反对李森科院士的理论论点和实际建议。
    我不想自居裁判员，评定这些科学家的工作方向谁优谁劣。大家知道，实践、生活才是裁判员。而实践说明它卫护米丘林和他的事业的继承者李森科院士的生物学派。例如，拿列宁奖金来说吧。谁在选种方面获得了列宁奖金呢？是生物学中唯物主义流派的科学家，这是季米里雅泽夫学派，是米丘林学派，是李森科学派。而作为反对李森科的米丘林观点的主要组织者之一——生物学家杜比宁的工作有何杰出之处呢？他在莫斯科工作尚且没有带来什么大好处，他到新西伯利亚或海参崴去恐怕未必会有什么好处。
    苏联科学家对人民有伟大的功迹。生活向科学提出了新任务。因此，今后仍然应当重视发展科学、加强科学同生活的联系。我们要求苏联科学院和它的主席团制定出进一步改善科学院、它的各个学部、分院和研究所的活动的建议。
        坚决反对浪费、疲沓松懈的
    现象，提高产品质量
    同志们！提高产品质量的问题值得特别注意。我想读一封信，信上谈的是有关我们某些机器的质量问题。这封信是工程师安季利卡托罗夫同志写给党中央委员会的。他写道：
    谨奉告您们，用来使玉蜀黍的耕种全盘机械化的全套机器有以下这些毛病：
    基洛夫格勒“红星”工厂的吊挂式播种机机架的载重主梁的左端弯曲到这种程度，以至左边歪到了垂直平面上。前边的分离纽比后面的低十厘米。（加了衬垫）。整步自动机中的缝隙没有调整。（已经锯掉）。整步自动机的小轮上的曲柄把手长短不一，因而播种器也不是同时开闭。
  （锯掉了三到五毫米）。阀杆带有很长的螺纹尖端，使得不能进行必要的调整（五个阀杆截短了一点五毫米并去掉了螺纹）。缺四个阀的弹簧。
  （装上新的）。一个开沟器中的阀护罩被揉软后，放到一个开尾销上去。
  （已经弄直了）。六套仪器没有按标记安放。（已按技术规程安装了）。蝶阀开闭不能同时进行。（已经把阀折弯并锉平有凸轮的小道）。播种机器中的拨料机在轴心接头中留的侧间隙太多，不能落入圆板的孔穴。（已经加以调整并把轴向下折弯）。张力木橛有：制动轮齿形铸造物，制动掣子齿锉得不好；制动轮侧壁在同支板磨擦下常常卡住；制动器转筒的轴在刨磨的地方有一平方铸造突出部分。（已经锉去一切张力橛相互磨擦的零件）。
    MT3—五明斯克拖拉机工厂拖拉机的缺点：
    传导装置的减速器不能用杠杆转为快速传送。（必须打开传送箱盖子，消除闭锁机拉手器的障碍）。
    直到燃料泵前的加速器牵引转数过大。（已经加以调整）。散热器通风门的牵引是弓形的。（已经折直）。抽水唧筒的压垫盖螺丝帽卷了三线，产生了漏水现象。　（已拉紧）。
    所有机器不是同时来的，是拆散装配的。
    拖拉机和播种机现在完全经过调整、试开，并且投入了工作。
                            机械工程师安季利卡托罗夫
                            1959年5月22日
    同志们，这是什么消息！你们认为这是什么现象？乌克兰的同志们，这是技术落后吗？
    不，这是漫不经心，是不负责任，是玩忽事业的利益。
    请你们原谅我，某些同志可能会以为，赫鲁晓夫讲话太刺耳、太粗暴了。不，这不是粗暴！这是严格要求，因为这样坏的工作实质上是破坏我们国家的威信。
    同志们！我认为，我们应当对出厂机器建立严格监督，以便使供应的机器完整无缺，而且质量很高。机器上应附有出厂证，让大家知道，是谁生产的零件，是谁检查的，是谁签发出厂证的。凡是制造不完整产品、或粗制滥造、或出废品的人，应当受到严厉的处分，而那些存心不良的废品制造者应当受法律制裁。
    要知道，“红星”工厂大概得到奖金了吧？我们表扬过“红星”工厂。而且这不仅仅同一个“红星”工厂有关。应当向废品制造者宣战。我们需要的是质量高的机器、高级产品。要知道，我们是在为自己工作。即使我们把产品供应给国外，甚至是给资本家，那也决不能给他们坏东西。因为如果这样，订货人会要求赔偿，我们将不得不再送给他新的零件，而增加额外的开支。同志们应当采取一切必要的措施，来保证产品的质量。我想，应当采取坚决的措施来反对那些不重视法令的人。
    应当把注意力集中在更新设备上。我参观了苏联国民经济成就展览会，那里收集了各种机器和机械装置的优秀样品，各种优秀的展览品。鉴于中央全会讨论技术进步的问题，这里专门辟了一个展览馆，其中陈列了我国好多企业仍在使用的过了时的设备的样品。同志们，这种光景是会使人害血管梗塞症的。要知道，展览会所展出的这些过时的坏机床和机械装置是我国工厂制造的，在那些工厂里有共产党员在工作。看来，这些工厂的党组织也通过了不少漂亮的决议，这些决议很讨人喜欢，但是，生产的实际情况却简直令人掉泪。
    如果我们照这样工作下去，那我们就要白流许多汗，而如果我们改变一下，把这些机器换掉，那在我们面前将会开辟多么巨大的可能性！须知某些机器已经老到这样的程度，简直是曾祖母辈的了。看来，应当考虑建立一个关于更新设备的制度。我们现在尚没有这样的制度。
    新成立的国家自动化和机器制造委员会应该特别研究这个问题。但是在战场上一个人是打不成仗的。应该有一个体系，而且是严整的体系，从工厂到国民经济委员会，到国家计划委员会和部长会议。
    同志们！现在全部问题在于加速我们前进的步伐，因为这就是加速通向共产主义的步伐。就像骑兵队里常说的，谢明·米哈依洛维奇·布琼尼对于这一点知道很清楚：准备行军的时候，应该给马钉好掌，否则马就会滑倒。我们也应该给马钉好掌，这些马就是新设备。应该号召科学家、发明家、合理化建议者和工人开动脑筋，尽快地用新设备代替过时的设备。我们不能放松这件事。现在，在全会开过以后，我们还要更具体地抓这一工作。可能应该召开国民经济委员会的会议，苏共中央主席团委员将去参加国民经济委员会的会议。应该重视所提出的问题，我们还要做很多工作。我们发射了宇宙火箭，难道我们不能很快地消除机器制造业中的缺点吗。
    这件事也和建筑业有关。库契连科在这里发言时，关于民用建筑谈了很多意见。在工业建筑中还有一些严重的问题。应该不放过那些设计师和工业企业的建筑师们，由于他们的过错，使我们有那么一些简直令人惊讶的工厂。住宅的情况也是这样。设计图样倒是很多，但是仔细一看就会发现，经常是一张图样和另一张图样只是装饰品的数目不同而已。而人们所需要的是舒适的房间，安置得很好的厨房和其他房间。人们正是从这种观点出发来评价住宅设计图样的好坏的。
    再说吊灯。已形成这样一种情况：生产吊灯不想法使它们好看，不是为了美化生活，而且想法使他们更重些。哪个工厂出品的吊灯越重，这个工厂就赚得钱越多，因为工厂的产品是按每一吨重量来估价的。（笑声）这样，工厂生产出几普特重的吊灯，完成了计划，可是谁需要这样的计划，它能给谁照亮呢？工厂越是超额完成计划，浪费的铜就越多，而并不是到处须要用铜，用黑色金属和木材也可以。（有人喊：也可以用塑料。）
    赫鲁晓夫：我在这里谈的是黑色金属。用黑色金属也可以做出漂亮的东西，而且是人们很欣赏的东西。
    谈谈家具的情况。很多消费者有时不愿意购买我们苏联的家具，而在寻找外国货。为什么？因为外国家具比较合用。我们家具工厂制定计划是按卢布计算的。因此，工厂只生产大软椅就更合算些，而且这样的软椅比较重，也就是说价钱比较贵。不论是重也罢，贵也罢，做家具的人爱做这样的软椅，总是认为这是值钱的！计划表面上完成了，而谁需要这样的软椅呢？要是制造普通的椅子，你们知道，需要生产多少这样的椅子才能完成计划呢？这样，工厂就要考虑：做软椅呢还是做普通椅子？软椅终于占了上风，据说是对本厂生产有利。而且，人们都看清了这一点，关于这个问题都谈得很多了，可是软椅依然占了上风。
    我们很多机器制造产品也是按重量订计划的，因此，底架座比需要的重一倍，又是多余的重量使计划得以完成。
    应当肯定这些新的条件，使它们去鼓舞和推动人们更好地组织生产，设计出更好的、更合理的样品和模型。
    现在再回头来谈谈建筑的问题。有人告诉我：行政管理用的建筑有三百种标准设计。在这些设计中有些什么样的区别呢？一种设计的窗户是半圆形的，而另一种是直角形的。在许多情况下区别仅在于此！这里又有什么花样可想呢？这种标准设计能使谁满意呢？我们有权合理地办事，然而我们有时没有能运用这种权力。可是，同志们，我们应该有决心来打垮那些聪明过度的聪明人。各共和国党中央委员会、州党委会、边疆区党委会、部长会议、边疆区执行委员会和州执行委员会要以主人翁的态度来对待建筑工作。
    我们在很快地建筑住宅，简直是在用流水作业法建筑。我想，再过一年或一年半，我们将像装配汽车一样地来装配住宅。房屋构件的成组立模制造法和工程师科兹洛夫创造的振动轧材是件了不起的事情。对工业建筑来说，振动轧材可以用来做楼盖也可用来做墙板砌块。必须广泛采用振动轧材。
    同志们，我还希望你们注意一个问题。我们花了几亿卢布买来了化学及其他的设备。同志们，看来，既然我们用金子去买机器，既然我们买的设备通常都是自己不能制造的，或者即使能制造，但型式也是过时了的，那么就应该买了马上投入生产，不让设备搁着。但是有时却对这种设备采取了以下的态度。买了几亿卢布的化学工业设备。近三年来，在国外买了几千种机器和仪器。
    在新古比雪夫斯克石油加工工厂中，规定要用进口装备来建立装置，以便保证斯大林诺哥尔斯克工厂的原料。装备完全运到，但是建设实质上并没有进行。由于这样，就可能妨碍了斯大林诺哥尔斯克工厂车间的开工。第聂伯罗比得罗夫斯克轮胎工厂用的进口装备从去年11月就放置起来，这些装备现在已经开始在生锈，但是化学委员会至今还没有结束技术资料的研究。不能理解，这和技术文件有什么关系呢？要知道我们购买工厂的装备是连同全部工艺规程一块购买的。
    1955—1956年在瑞典和芬兰为阿尔汉格尔斯克国民经济委员会的科特拉斯克纸浆造纸联合厂购买了装备——造纸板机。这些机器预定要到1961年第四季度才能投入生产！同志们，这种事实并不少。这对贵重装备是犯罪行为。这里对外贸易部、国家计划委员会和国民经济委员会都有责任。既然我们购买了装备，就要立刻准备建设，并且不仅是准备，而是开始建设，以便等装备一到就可以立刻安装。我们能保证做到这一点吗？当然能够。
    这样就不会买来等着了。什么时候运到，什么时候才开始研究怎么办。我再说一遍，这是对事业的犯罪行为。
    谈谈关于纺织工业的几点意见。中央委员会和部长会议草拟的建议已在柯西金同志的报告中阐明。有一个时期我们几乎把所有资金都用来发展重工业。这是完全正确的。而现在，如计划所规定那样，重工业在发展上应该超过轻工业。现在，我们能够发展轻工业、发展生产消费品的工业，而无损于重工业。应该更快地发展化学。可能在那些生产化学设备、研究化学发展问题的企业、机关和国民经济委员会中应该建立促进委员会。
    需要特别注意新事业。应该派人照管，设备要及时生产出来，质量要高，定货要在规定的时间内交货。如果国民经济委员会将来不遵守合同规定的期限，那末，我们就不能把规定的项目交付使用。一个国民经济委员会不能提供零件，而别的国民经济委员会没有这种零件就不能安装机器。准确性、组织性、责任感是做好工作的准绳。应该在中央委员会中指派一批人，经常注意关于加速化学发展的决议的执行情况。
    我们的国家获得很多的化学产品。必须把它们加工，必须用这些产品织出布和做出其他的东西。为了这一目的，纺织设备是值得买的。我们已经向国外定购新型的机器，但是必须在生产中迅速运用我们发明家所制造的机器。必须利用一切新的发明。捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国在化学方面已经作了许多工作，它们的经验值得利用。
    必须建设现代化工厂和更换旧厂的设备。柯西金同志说，我们有建设得很经济并且拥有通风、调整空气温度的设备和良好的人工照明设备的工厂。这种工厂比我们现在按旧的设计建设的工厂要便宜。我们想在莫斯科迅速地建设这样的工厂以便使国民经济委员会能够把它作为范例。在外国，建设厂房中已经不采用旧的结构，因此在资金和厂房交付使用的期限上都得到不少的好处。
    我已经不止一次地说到关于集中使用投资的意义。但是我们现在仍旧把资金分散到许多项目中，我们对如何在新企业中迅速获得产品方面的考虑是不够的。必须采取措施使建设项目及时地投入生产。不能把建设期限延长到八年至十年。
    即使把另一项建设工程推迟一些也是好的，因为无须乎证明，如果我们多开始建设一些项目，这完全不等于我们从这些项目得到更多的产品。我们常常拖延建设并因此拖延交货。这是不合理的。资本家们不能这样做，因为这样做就要破产，而我们建设一个工厂有时需要十年到十五年，而且要拨款维持一个生产效能很低的机构，这是一件傻事。
    这是本位主义的表现，因为每个单位都极力想开始施工，那怕先开始一点点，瞧，明年准会拨给更多的钱。请听，我们是在捞谁一把呢？对这些领导干部，就应该揪住他们的耳朵拉到太阳底下让大家看看，因为一个建设工程开始施工，另一个又开始施工，而对国家并没有好处。应该严肃地对待这种现象，因为这将会给我们的经济带来损害。
    某些项目的建设推迟三、五年，然后在两年内完成它，这是更合宜的。不要忘记，在开始建设的同时，我们就应该预见到这项建设工程在具体的、而绝不是辽远的时期内完成、结束。如果开始给一个建设工程拨款，而没有具备为迅速竣工所必须的一切，这时最好先不开始这个建设工程。
    迪姆希茨同志在这里发了言，他谈到在印度的比莱建设钢铁厂的经验。当时我们的设计师在一年半到两年的时间内完成了钢铁厂的设计工作，然后我们的专家和印度人紧密合作，短期内就建成了工厂。我们乌克兰的建筑师六个月内建立起一些最大的高炉。还有一些平炉和其他重要工程项目是在更短的期限内建立起来的。可以举出很多好的例子来说明我们的建筑师可以又快又好地建设最重要的生产工程。
    如果一切都安排就绪、考虑周详并准备停当，那么工人的劳动效率就会很高，全体建设者们工作起来就更协调、更有组织，建筑工程就能高速进行。我们正是应该这样安排工作。
    现在我想谈谈节约有色金属的问题。我们忽视了这个问题，但是国家却拿出不少黄金，譬如说，购买国民经济所十分需要的铜。结果往往用这些铜作七零八碎的东西，而国家计划委员会竟也计划进行这种生产。然而，有许多东西本来应该用塑料、铝以及其他比较不缺乏的材料来制造的，现在都用铜来制造了。应该限制稀有的有色金属的使用，必须对这个工作进行比较严格的监督。党组织应当关心备至地进行监督，不允许把稀有的有色金属用到可以用其他代用品而无损于产品生产的地方。全力扩大对决议执行情况的社会监督
  同志们！生产的全盘机械化和自动化问题，这是一个中心问题，在我们的全会上，这个问题也是一个枢纽。但是，只要每个企业或建筑工地合理地安排劳动，这个问题可以很好地解决。生产的机械化和自动化的先决条件是很妥善地安排工人的劳动。但是，很多企业在组织劳动方面有着十分严重的缺点。
    应当教育工人，使他们充分认识自己的职责努力工作，使他们的劳动具有很高的效率，使人们努力做到充分利用工作日。工作时间应当从事生产劳动。在生产中应当充满这样的气氛。对马马虎虎的工作人员抱不能容忍的态度。如果有任何一个工人在无所事事地闲扯，那么，一起工作的同志们有责任直截了当地对他说，他是靠左右勤勤恳恳地劳动的工人过日子的。
    在我们的企业中必须进行坚决的斗争来反对浪费现象、疲沓散漫、不守纪律的现象、反对旷工的人和游手好闲的人。
    生产的全盘机械化和自动化，以高度的劳动组织为先决条件。必须使每一个劳动者对完成生产定额、提高产品质量、降低产品成本具有高度的责任感。即便在自上至下合理地领导经济的条件下，当科学的发展，建设性思想的发展保证创造生产率很高的新联动机和机床、保证广泛采用流水作业线，和保证许多生产过程的自动化的时候，居首要地位的仍然是人，工作的组织性、工作的准确性将取决于他。一切归根到底都取决于人，因为如果只有一个人看管自动作业线，而这个人是不守纪律的，那么，这个工作人员将给生产造成巨大的损失，如果这个工作人员是在一个单独的机床上操作，那么所造成的损失将大得多。我们应当努力使人们意识到这一点。
    因此，首先应当有良好的纪律。必须以共产主义自觉性的精神来教育劳动人民。在全会上发言的有男女工人、卓越的生产革新者。我们这里有千千万万这种人——青年、共青团员、党员和非党人士。应当经常同大家一起工作，而这里有许多任务摆在我们各级党组织、工会和共青团的面前。在目前条件下，它们的职责就是争取使我们的共同事业无限发展，而它们的工作必须大力改进。
    同志们！最近几年来，党在改组工业和建筑业管理方面，在改进农业领导工作方面，在扩大各加盟共和国和地方机关的权力方面实行了一系列重大的措施。所有这一切有助于在管理方面加强列宁主义的民主集中制原则，有助于用尽一切方法发扬群众的创造主动性和积极性，有助于更加充分地利用巨大的后备力量来使各经济部门出现新的高涨，使人民的物质福利和文化不断提高。这些措施对实现共产主义建设任务具有重大的意义。
    此外，党中央曾一再指示，必须用尽一切办法加强和严格遵守国法，不容许出现地方主义，擅自把投资和物资资源用于地方需要，不执行合作供应计划的现象。
    我们的干部是用高度的觉悟和对共产主义建设事业的忠诚的精神培养出来的。他们严格遵守党和国家的纪律，竭尽全力为人民造福。
    但是，遗憾的是，还有些党、苏维埃和经济组织的个别领导人违反党纪国法的。
    这表现在什么地方呢？请让我举一些严重违反苏联法律的事实。例如，摩尔曼斯克州的领导人擅自改变了工业品和粮食的零售价格，尽管他们知道，他们是无权决定这样的问题的。
    去年，新西伯利亚州的领导人在收购粮食的时候竟欺骗了国家。党中央委员会严厉处分了严重违反纪律的摩尔曼斯克州和新西伯利亚州的领导人。
    还必须谈谈这样一些令人气愤的事实：一些经济领导人没有及时完成为其他国民经济委员会提供制件和材料的任务。个别工作人员不考虑国家利益，越权行事，似乎法律不是为他们制定的，他们办事的原则就是，想干什么，就干什么。
    尽管不止一次地提出警告，阿尔汗格尔州国民经济委员会经常不完成向其他国民经济委员会提供木材、锯材和标准住宅的任务。而同时在自己的经济区中超计划地浪费了大量的这些材料。
    不久前苏共中央揭露，东哈萨克国民经济委员会在去年利用有色冶金企业的资源耗费了大笔资金来进行计划没有规定的工作，从而损害了这些企业的进一步扩建。
    也有闹地方主义和破坏向国家供应畜产品的规定手续的事实。请允许我举几个共和国作例子。哈萨克上半年肉制品的采购计划到6月1日完成了111％，供应国家的计划只完成了28％，而供应地方的计划完成了95％。乌克兰肉类采购计划在同一时期完成了95％，供应国家的完成了47％，供应本身需要的完成了92.1％。
    在加里宁格勒州，拉脱维亚共和国、吉尔吉斯共和国和乌兹别克共和国也有破坏党和国家纪律以及地方主义的现象。
    这种破坏纪律的事实和地方主义的现象应该受到最严励的谴责，因为这种行为给国民经济带来巨大损失。
    就拿集体农民出售奶牛给集体农庄这个问题来说吧。以前我曾谈过库尔斯克州卡利诺夫卡村集体农庄的经验，这个村的集体农民根据我们的建议决定把奶牛卖给集体农庄，而他们自己用的必需数量的牛奶则按劳动日获得。这样做是绝对自愿的。集体农民很高兴地把奶牛卖掉了，因为他们相信集体农庄可以保证供应他们牛奶。此时这里的公共畜牧业已很发达。集体农民把奶牛售出以后，物质状况不但没有恶化，而且好转了。女庄员也由低效率的养牛劳动中解放出来了。
    我们赞成集体农庄经济的这种发展道路，但是这项工作必须随着公共畜牧业增产的提高来进行。
    但是有些地区的某些同志在这方面做得过火了。他们还没有创造必要的条件就要求集体农民把自己的奶牛出售给集体农庄。必须提出警告，谁要再滥用职权，强迫命令，就要严办肇事者，并将情节在报上公布。
    至于在那些公共畜牧业很发达的集体农庄，由公有经济来满足集体农民对牛奶的需求，而农民们把自己的奶牛卖给集体农庄，这是合宜的。这一点，我想无须加以证明。但是，这不能用行政命令的方式进行，而应通过发展集体农庄生产来实现。党中央委员会一再警告，在这方面必须遵守自愿的原则，而不应该草率从事。要做到让女庄员夸奖你们，而不要让她们埋怨，硬要她们出售奶牛。必须建立条件，使女庄员会来要求你去买她的奶牛。只有在她看到依靠集体农庄的公共生产她可以获得必需的畜产品，看到她会有牛奶的时候，她才会这样做。
    同志们！党和国家的纪律问题，是党和国家机构全体干部活动中基础的基础。有些工作人员接到决议后还议论着：我愿意执行就执行，我愿意不执行就不执行，这种人不应该有他们的位置。决议一经通过，谁也没有权利破坏它。谁不同意这个决议，可以把自己的理由向党中央、政府或者最高苏维埃提出。但是在决议或法律没有改变之前，就应该遵循它们，必须严格地遵守。
    必须同破坏党和国家纪律的现象作坚决斗争，不管它以何种形式出现。必须教育干部，使大家一无例外地严格服从党和国家的利益。同志们，不做到这一点，我们就不能顺利地前进。
    必须指出，苏维埃监察委员会的工作有严重的缺点。它应该加强监督党的决议和苏维埃国家的法律的执行情况。检察机关必须经常对遵守苏联法律的情况实行监督。
    可以对随便哪一条法律提出修改的建议，但是当这条法律仍然有效时，谁也不能破坏它。列宁在1922年在一封“谈服从和法制的二重性”的信中说，法制不可能是卡卢加有一套，喀山有一套，而应该是全俄罗斯统一的，是所有加盟共和国统一的。
    现在，当我国进入全面展开建设共产主义社会的时期，公众对党和政府指令执行情况的监督有着巨大意义。
    应该在国家组织、经济组织和其他组织的各个环节中加强监督工作。中央委员会主席团不久前就这个问题作出了一项决议。我想，中央委员会的委员们会赞同这项决议的。你们知道，党章中规定党组织有权利监督行政的工作，但是党章中并没有明确规定这种监督的具体内容，因而很多党组织没有充分利用给予他们的监督权利。赋于这种监督以组织形式的必要性已经成熟。中央委员会主席团认为，有必要在生产和贸易企业的基层党组织中成立由党员和预备党员组成的委员会，以便使党组织实现对行政工作进行监督的权利。这些委员会应该经常地监督企业按时完成生产任务、国家订货以及供应各种高质产品的情况，监督企业全体工作人员严格遵守国家纪律的情况，同损害全国利益的地方主义以及狭隘的部门观点作斗争。它们可以对行政的决议提出异议，向党的机构和苏维埃机构汇报不法的错误行为，以及违犯法律或违犯党和政府决议的决定。同志们，我想这样做是对的。（有人喊：对。）
    赫鲁晓夫：各级党组织壮大了，在组织上和思想上都更加巩固了。在这种情况下，决不会有这样的危险：监督委员会的成立导致代替行政机关或者破坏一长制。当然，这种委员会对某些人，特别是对那些想不顾公共利益横冲直闯的特别热心的人来说，是一种负担。但是，显然，这对事业有好处。
    应当随时随地展开批评与自我批评，应当随身带着刷子，去洗刷干净有尘埃和积垢的地方，使我们的党组织、我们的苏维埃组织和经济机关保持清洁和朝气蓬勃。　（掌声）
        更加紧密地团结共产主义建
    设者的队伍去从事伟大的事业
    同志们！现在请允许我谈谈我对改进干部工作的一些意见。必须正确地使用我们现有的干部。我们现在有很多很多的干部。但是，我们在培养干部方面还存在着重大的缺点。还没有一个应有的科学的估计，各国民经济部门究竟需要多少和什么样的专门人材，经过一定的时期，对这些专门人材，对这种或那种干部又有什么样的需求。因为如果我们的各级学校培养出来的专门人材，将来学非所用，那末，这就说明我们的组织工作做得不好。应当考虑一下如何更加合理地计划我们各级学校培养干部的工作，即使是要减少一些系，也不必害怕。
    但是这完全不是说，我们应该收缩我国高等学校和中等学校培养专家的工作。相反，应当全力发展这个事业，因为我国受过高等和中等专业教育的人愈多，生产就会愈加组织得好。这是很自然的。但是应该有一个全国计划，来培养精通技术和国民经济各部门的专家。
    必须更好地在国内组织职业教育。在这方面我们做了很多工作，但是对职业教育的注意不能放松。
    应该多关心夜校和函授教育，以便人们能不脱产获得教育。
    应当指出，我国有些地方对中等专业学校培养人材的工作抱有不正确的态度。青年人只想获得高等专业教育，这是很自然的。但是国民经济也需要受过中等教育的专家。在企业、工地、农业及其他部门中，都需要许多技士、受过中等技术教育的专家。这种专家应当很好地通晓自己的业务，培养这种专家也需要很大的力气。大家都知道，高等学校培养人材比中等学校要多花许多时间，但是并非所有的专家在生活中都用得上所学的全部知识。因此，一些高等学校可以在培养工程师的同时，也可以培养高度熟练的技士。
    我再说一遍，我们应当更加重视培养中等专家。在这方面，技术专科学校应当起重大的作用。我们具有一切条件来扩大和改善技术专科学校的工作。一个人在技术专科学校毕业后，他可以一边参加生产，一边提高自己的文化水平，可以在夜校或函授学校受高等教育。这将是非常宝贵的精通自己业务的专家。我们应当用一切办法来鼓励培养这种专家。
    还应当考虑改进接收研究生的工作。有些人现在作研究生，并不是因为他们有才能，而是因为他们有有才能的妈妈和爸爸。这种情况并不总是符合正确培养国民经济所需要的科学工作者的原则的。
    应当建立这样一种制度，就是从生产岗位中抽人作研究生，他们应持有这些未来的科学工作者所在单位的工人、工程技术工作者集体的推荐书，以便使那些有培养前途的人作研究生，可以相信，他们在研究班毕业后无疑会作出贡献的。
    同志们，关于新老干部的正确结合、关于提拔青年的问题，我们已经谈得很多了。当然，应该好好使用我们的老头子们，但不能使他们熬得太久。要知道，这些人已经做了很多、很好的工作，他们有权利，也有可能在晚年呼吸呼吸新鲜空气，休息一下。我这是代表自己向老头子们作一番宣传，因为我自己也属于这一伙人的。但是，老头子们却是贪做工作的人。如果一个人从小到老一直在劳动，而现在提出要他去担任另外一种比较轻松的工作，他就会说：怎么啦，我做了坏事吗？为什么要把我免职呢？你什么坏事也没有做，但是也让别人有机会好好地工作吧。不过，这种人会说：不，我还能工作。其实，他已经没有从前那种充沛的精力了，他已经不能再保持劳动中必要的紧张劲儿了。有些人只能说说而已，实际已经不能做什么事了，因为精力不逮。大家都看到这点，但是，这个人本人却没有看到这点，他的心里对这点不服气。但是生命终归是生命，生命的规律谁也规避不了的。我非常明白这种人的心理。当然，要你同意你已经应该领养老金，要你同意你已经应该从热闹集市里坐车回家，而不是去赶集，这是不好受的。（全场活跃、掌声）考涅楚克同志在他写的一个剧本中对这点说得很中肯。但是，当一些人实际上已经要退出闹市时，却还以为他们只能是赶集的，这样做是对工作没有好处的。
    因此，对那些自己不能决定该去赶集还是退集的同志们，党委会应当帮助他们作出决定（全场活跃）。
    必须让青年人有机会做更多的工作。但是，我们对青年的含义作何理解呢？在革命的初期，我们把四十岁到四十五岁的人看作是老头子。而现在人们却把这种年纪的人说成是青年。我想，我们不应当忘记自己的时间。同志们，你们记得，在党的第二十一次代表大会上关于这些问题已经谈得很多了。应当大胆而明智地解决这个问题。
    当然，不应忘记那些有经验和通晓业务的人，因为他们是很有用的人，他们的知识和生活经验应该充分地加以利用。可以吸引他们参加到事业中来，例如，做各技术和经济委员会的监察员、指导员。如果正确地对待这些人，而正是应该这样地解决问题，那么才能永远为这些同志找到光荣和有益的工作。因此我们也就可以更妥善地使用我们的力量和分配干部，以便更合理、有利地使用他们为我们共同事业服务。
    同志们！我们全会的工作是在很高的水平上、在发挥高度积极性的情况下，本着布尔什维克的求实精神进行的。这是值得自豪和称颂的。我想谈一谈在我们全会上所做的内容丰富的报告和内容同样丰富的发言。当然，有一些人的发言是有瑕疵的，但是，正如俗语所说的，太阳还有黑点哩。但是，所有的发言都是好的，所有发言人的目的是一个——尽一切努力保证顺利完成苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议，并向全世界表明，掌握了政权的工人阶级、劳动人民能够做出怎样的事情来。
    实际上，生活不仅一年比一年，而且是一天比一天变得越来越快活。我们好像搬起巨大的花岗岩，并用它建立起永存的我们共产主义社会的宏伟大厦。
    值得注意的是，现在甚至大资本家到我国来，同我们谈话也采取了另外的口吻。不久前，我和哈里曼先生谈过话。我问他：对我们的七年计划有什么看法？
      “我想，你们会实现这个计划。”这位美国百万富翁回答道。
    我们谈话时，哈里曼还顺便问道：
      “我们以后怎么办呢？事情将往哪里发展？”
    我回答他说：“让我们共处下去，安排和平共处。而这是什么意思呢？我们将改善我们两国的和平关系，发展经济和文化交流方面的合作，一句话，和平共处！”
    美国和其他资本主义国家的实业界人士及其他国家活动家和政治活动家，越来越多地到我们这里来访问。现在资本家不得不考虑苏联这个世界和平的强大因素。这一切都说明，他们承认我们有力量，不但承认了，而且在日益发展壮大和节节胜利的社会主义世界前面发抖。
    现在西方世界的领导人已经不再硬不承认我们会赶上他们，不再像从前一样嘲笑我们，说我们的计划是不现实的。现在他们只能用这样的说法使自己放心，聊以自慰：说什么我们不能如计划规定的那样快地赶上他们。
    我们什么时候在绝对产量方面赶上和超过美国，我们什么时候在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上和超过经济上最发达的资本主义国家，这种问题用理论争论是解决不了的。从理论上来说，这一切都已经论证了。实际解决这些问题要依靠生活本身。依靠我国根据社会主义社会客观规律的发展来保证。
    我国共产党遵循着马克思列宁主义的学说，领导苏联人民取得伟大的胜利，取得如此杰出的成就，依靠这些成就苏联在工业产量方面赶上和超过了除美国以外的所有的资本主义国家。我们本着对这个革命学说的毫不动摇的忠诚，相信明天我们会成为世界上第一号国家！我们坚定地知道这一点，因为我们给伟大的共产主义大厦坚固地奠定了坚固不拔的根基。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    同志们，我们必须付出更大的努力来达到预定的目的，要更勇敢地对现有缺点提出批评，要对现有缺点表现出布尔什维克的不妥协精神。缺点——这不是一个抽象的概念，这些缺点是在一定的人身上表现出来的。不要怕对自己的朋友说出真实情况，不要怕！如果你告诉他真实情况，而他的确是你的朋友，那他会明白你对他这样说是出于原则立场。如果他不理解你，那就意味着他不是你的朋友，意味着他不理解简单明了的事情。不应该违背自己的良心。这种违背自己良心的行为只会给我们共产主义建设带来危害。
    这也是一场为保证我们共同事业胜利而进行的原则性的列宁主义斗争。所以，在我们全部工作的组织方面，让我们都首先从这个立场出发吧。只有这样，才能团结人们去完成伟大的事业。
    那些阿谀献媚，好在别人面前奉承拍马和讨好某些人的人，在党组织内永远站不住脚。这样的工作人员终究要同那些曾经对他们逢迎讨好的那一伙奸邪之徒一起垮台。
    只有在原则性的基础上才能建立起人与人之间的原则性的友谊和党组织内的布尔什维克的团结。而且只有这样的组织才能胜利地解决国家和党的任何问题。　（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）
    在我们的作家中有这样一些人，他们说：党对文学能够进行怎样的领导呢？我们对这些人这样说：亲爱的，怎么，你不承认党的领导吗？可是，什么是党的领导呢？要知道，这是千百万人民的意志，是千百万有智慧的人的意志，是千百万人的集体智慧。有一位文学家，整天坐在一个小别墅里创作他那有时是病态的作品。他还希望人们把这部作品看作是当代人和全体人民智慧的化身。这难道不是地地道道的个人迷信吗？你们知道吗，就是这种人物现在不想接受代表千百万人意志的党的领导。而这种人想要同他的虚构的作品一道凌驾于党和人民之上。各种莫名其妙的人是屡见不鲜的！当然这可以说是一种反常的心理现象，而且显然这种个别人的偏见就是到共产主义社会也会存在的。
    同志们，我现在要结束我的讲话了。祝中央全会的全体参加者，祝参加这次出色的中央全会工作的党和苏维埃的工作人员、厂长、工程师、科学家、先进工人、农业工作者，以及所有党和非党的同志们回到自己岗位上以后，以新的精力来实现党的第二十一次代表大会的具有历史意义的决议，勤恳不懈地为我国人民工作，为人民工作，为共产主义事业工作，殊途同归，汇成巨流。
    同志们！我深信，我们党组织将尽一切努力来更广泛地动员群众，引导他们去完成第二十一次党代表大会提出的宏伟任务，顺利完成和超额完成七年计划。这是增强我们国家和整个社会主义阵营、巩固全世界和平和在我国建立共产主义社会的最伟大的事业。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）。
