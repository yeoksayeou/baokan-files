The objective basis for commodity price setting under socialism
Xiao Gongda

Under the socialist system, the price of commodities is determined by state organs, not formed spontaneously. Therefore, the question arises: does the price under the socialist system have an objective basis?

Setting prices must be based on the amount of socially necessary labor

The price under the socialist system is also a monetary expression of value, which must be based on the amount of socially necessary labor. This is determined by the characteristics of the socialist economy. In the socialist stage, the degree of public ownership is different, and there are still differences between ownership by the whole people and collective ownership; the level of development of productive forces has not yet reached the level of "distribution according to needs"; people's communist consciousness needs to be improved, and it is necessary to implement the socialist principle of material interests in enterprises and implement economic accounting, etc. Therefore, the products of enterprises must be compensated by means of sale, and compensated according to the amount of socially necessary labor. Only in this way can we spur the backward, encourage progress, and promote the faster development of social productive forces. For backward or loss-making enterprises, if the products produced are needed by the state, the state can take temporary subsidies or loans to maintain their production and promote them to improve their management and gradually move from loss to profit. Stalin said that the law of value "is a very good school of practice"①, and its significance lies here. Facts show that as long as management is improved, many backward indigenous production enterprises can also make profits. For example, after the Nanyang Iron Plant of the Hongzhuan Commune in Shaxian County, Fujian Province improved its management, the cost of pig iron was reduced from 310 yuan per ton to 124.75 yuan per ton, making the iron plant profitable and netting 7,000 yuan and six jiao in January. It can be seen that setting prices according to the amount of socially necessary labor and the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods are not contradictory, but will instead promote continuous improvement of indigenous production in terms of technology and labor organization. If there are really such factories that consume manpower and materials without producing results, they should be shut down and "give way" to concentrate manpower and materials in factories with better production conditions. This can avoid the waste of manpower and materials and make social production more effective.

Since price setting must consider the amount of socially necessary labor, it is necessary to have an in-depth and meticulous work style when setting prices, and investigate the socially necessary labor consumption of products. The labor contained in a commodity includes the following parts: the past labor reflected in the consumed means of production, and the new labor consumption added by workers in the production process. Since "price is the money-name of the labour objectified in the commodity"②, we can obtain an approximate (because prices and values ​​are often inconsistent) amount of socially necessary labor consumption from the sum of the prices of the means of production, workers' wages, and the profits and taxes created by workers and turned over to the state.

The law of value requires that commodities be exchanged according to the value determined by the amount of socially necessary labor, but this does not mean that commodities can only be exchanged according to social value. Under the capitalist system, due to the effects of competition and the law of anarchy, capitalists, in order to pursue profits, are willing to produce products with higher prices. As a result, the supply of this product exceeds demand, and the price will fall, even below the value. Some other products with lower prices, because everyone is unwilling to produce them, result in demand exceeding supply, and the price will rise, even above the value. The regularity of the law of value is masked by the phenomenon of irregularity. In fact, from the perspective of the entire society, from the average of the long-term rise and fall of the price of a commodity, the sum of prices and values ​​is consistent. Marx once said: "The assumption that commodities in the different spheres of production are sold at their values, means, of course, only that their values are centres around which their prices oscillate, and at which their prices are equalized."③ Not only in capitalist society but also in socialist society, prices and values ​​often deviate. The possibility of this deviation "exists within the price form"④. Since price is the monetary expression of value, inconsistency may occur between form and content. This deviation is also caused by the effect of socialist unique economic laws (which will be discussed later). The degree and form of deviation between price and value vary in different societies or at different stages of the same society. In the capitalist era when free competition dominates, prices fluctuate spontaneously around value; under the socialist system, the deviation between price and value is consciously and planned by people; however, any deviation of price must revolve around value, which is determined by the effect of the law of value. The deviation between price and value itself is not a requirement of the law of value. Therefore, arbitrarily excessively high or low prices that violate value or that prices and values ​​are detached from each other violate the requirements of the law of value, and the result will be that production is unduly encouraged or打击。

Some people inappropriately raise prices excessively to stimulate production and to complete purchase tasks, which is wrong. For example, if the price of poultry and eggs is too high, farmers will be unwilling to raise pigs and will be willing to increase the production of poultry and eggs. As a result, the pig plan is disrupted, resulting in the one-sided development of production, with some products being overproduced and others being underproduced. High-price policies will also reduce people's purchasing power, affect the stability of the monetary system, make it difficult for enterprises to calculate, and make it difficult for the state to calculate when formulating plans. In fact, some purchase prices are not low, but the purchase task is still not completed. For example, the purchase price of charcoal in Pucheng County, Fujian Province is 2.3 yuan per dan (the normal purchase price in the past was 1.8 yuan), but the result is still that the purchase task is not completed. This shows that all economic work should be combined with political work. Reasonable prices cannot solve all problems, and it is also necessary to strengthen market management and conduct socialist ideological education for farmers.

In short, violating the law of value, causing prices and values ​​to be detached from each other, will inevitably cause confusion in economic life, forcing people to adjust prices in the opposite direction to make them tend toward value. This is the result of the law of value in action. It also shows that the objective effect of the law of value is independent of human will, and it will "enforce itself as does the law of gravity when a house falls about our ears."⑤ This spontaneous effect is inevitable under the capitalist system. Under the socialist system, it is caused by people's failure to recognize the requirements of the law of value. The mistake lies in people and not in the law itself. At the same time, this spontaneous effect cannot be regarded as a negative effect of the law of value itself. From a certain perspective, this is a positive effect, because this destructive effect will educate people from the opposite side and force people to correct their mistakes. This is not only the case for the law of value; if people violate the socialist unique economic laws, such as the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy, it will also cause confusion in economic life. We certainly cannot say that socialist unique economic laws also have negative effects. Understanding this principle can continuously improve our level of understanding and improve economic work.

Price work is a highly political work

Determining prices is not just about considering the requirements of the law of value. If this were the case, then we only need a group of staff who can calculate to conduct investigations and calculations according to formulas. Thus, price setting becomes purely a technical task, and no policies are needed. In fact, price work is a highly political work. The characteristics of prices under the socialist system do not lie in reflecting the requirements of the law of value, but in reflecting the requirements of the socialist unique economic laws. Therefore, it is necessary to have the guidance of Marxism-Leninism to do this work well. The difficulty of price work also lies here.

The basic socialist economic law determines all the main aspects and main processes of the socialist economy, and the socialist circulation process and the movement of prices in the circulation process are also determined by the basic socialist economic law. The price under the socialist system must guarantee the realization of the basic socialist economic law, that is, to guarantee the development of production and meet the needs of the people. In order to develop production, pricing should ensure that the costs of enterprises can be compensated, and also ensure that enterprises obtain certain profits, and prepare the necessary accumulation for the state and enterprises to expand reproduction. Prices set in this way not only conform to the basic economic laws, but also consider the socially necessary labor consumption in production, so they also conform to the requirements of the law of value. Recently, some enterprises have a purely profit-oriented view, inappropriately increasing product prices and increasing net profit. This violates the basic socialist economic law and is detrimental to production. From the perspective of producers, because the selling price of products is high, it is easy to complete the output value task, so they do not work hard to improve management. If high-priced products are daily necessities needed by the masses, it will inevitably affect the improvement of people's living standards, which is contrary to the production purpose stipulated by the basic socialist economic law. If high-priced products are means of production, it will inevitably increase the production costs of other departments, which will be detrimental to the development of other production departments. Of course, pricing too low, so that enterprises have no surplus or lose money, is also detrimental to production and also violates the basic socialist economic law. (There may be exceptions in some cases, see the next paragraph) Therefore, pricing should ensure that enterprises obtain profits, but it must be reasonable profits.

Starting from the basic socialist economic law, different prices can be adopted for various products. Some products, such as grain, cotton cloth, and vegetables, are daily necessities for the masses, so prices cannot be too high, otherwise the necessary means of subsistence for the working people cannot be met. Some of these daily necessities may also generate losses when operated by the state. In addition, some departments that are of great significance to the national economy, such as many heavy industry enterprises, must be operated even if they lose money or cannot make profits temporarily. In addition, the prices of some non-essential consumer goods, such as wool, silk, and tobacco and alcohol, can be set higher, which can not only increase accumulation for the country, but also not affect the living standards of the masses. In this case, the difference between the set price and the value is large, and the reason can only be explained by the effect of the basic socialist economic law. However, the effect of the law of value still exists, but it is more strictly restricted. The setting of such a higher price also needs to consider the consumption of socially necessary labor. No one will set the price of a cigarette equal to the price of a bottle of wine.

Under the socialist system, with the level of prices, some products have higher profits, while others have lower profits, and some even lose money. But from the overall aspect and from a long-term perspective, the operation of socialist enterprises is profitable, which is the characteristic of socialist profit, which is determined by socialist public ownership. Because of socialist public ownership, it is possible to use the profits of some departments to compensate other low-profit departments or loss-making departments. Due to socialist public ownership, it is also possible to overcome the narrow profit-oriented view under the private system, and because the state concentrates a large amount of fiscal revenue, it also has the ability to make up for temporary losses. In early May this year, in order to strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses and support agricultural and fishery production, the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee decided to make appropriate adjustments to the prices of agricultural and fishery production materials. It is estimated that the commercial sector will reduce its income by more than 7.2 million yuan by the end of this year, some of which will be losses, which is the result of the basic socialist economic law in action. Of course, this does not mean that profit is not important under the socialist system. Generally speaking, enterprises should make profits as much as possible. Without the profits of individual enterprises, there can be no comprehensive overall profits.

Prices under the socialist system must reflect the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy

Prices under the socialist system must also reflect the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy, which mainly needs to consider the requirements of this law when determining price ratios. For example, narrowing the price difference between industrial and agricultural products can increase farmers' income, increase investment in agriculture, and also stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production and promote the development of agriculture. On the other hand, in order not to affect the accumulation of national industrialization funds, the price difference between industrial and agricultural products can only be gradually narrowed. This shows that the price issue is related to the proportionate development of industry and agriculture, and also to the worker-peasant alliance. The price ratio of agricultural products exchanged for industrial products in the rural market of Fujian Province narrowed by 1.22% in 1958 compared with 1957. The purchase prices of various categories of agricultural products were slightly increased compared with 1957, of which local specialty products increased by 0.3%, cash crops increased by 0.31%, oilseeds increased by 0.69%, livestock and aquatic products increased by 1.03%, and grains increased by 1.24%. The prices of industrial products in 1958 were slightly lower than the prices in 1957, of which clothing, daily necessities, and medicines decreased by 1.14% to 2.67%. In order to promote agricultural production and prevent and control pests and diseases, the retail prices of some pesticides were reduced by 20%-30%.

The above is only in terms of the ratio between the two major production sectors. Now let's look at the ratio and plan between varieties. For example, the purchase price of industrial porcelain produced in Dehua, Fujian Province is too high. Therefore, the porcelain factory focuses on the production of this aspect. Some porcelain factories have stopped producing daily-use bowls for half a year, causing a shortage of daily-use bowls. Therefore, in order to complete the production plan of daily-use bowls, the difference between the ex-factory prices of industrial porcelain and daily-use porcelain cannot be too large. This also shows that the correct application of the law of value, so that prices do not deviate too much from value, is beneficial to the completion of the state's plan. But the reason why we want to adjust the price of porcelain to make the ex-factory price of industrial porcelain not too high is because we consider that daily-use porcelain is necessary for people's lives and is what the state's plan stipulates to produce. This shows that the socialist unique economic laws have a decisive effect on prices. The law of value plays its role under the premise of the effect of socialist economic laws. We do not use the law of value for the sake of using the law of value, but use the law of value to comprehensively complete the state's plan. This shows that consciously using the law of value will bring benefits to the socialist economy.

Price setting must also consider supply and sales plans. The prices of goods with large production quantities, especially products that have been stockpiled or are not selling well, should be lower to expand sales. The prices of some high-end consumer goods that are in short supply can be higher to reduce people's demand. That is to say, the price level can regulate people's demand, so that supply and demand are roughly balanced, and there will be no serious stockpiling or out-of-stock phenomena. But this is not the only way to regulate supply and demand. For some daily necessities that are in short supply and needed by the masses, a limited planned supply can be adopted to make supply and sales roughly consistent, so as not to cause price increases and affect the lives of the masses.

Finally, price setting must also consider the economic law of distribution according to work. The continuous growth of real wages is a characteristic of the socialist wage movement. The level of real wages of employees is determined by how many means of subsistence monetary wages can buy. The purchasing power of monetary wages is determined by prices. When monetary wages are relatively fixed, the price level determines the level of real wages. Take vegetable prices as an example. Taking the average price of vegetables in the Fuzhou market in 1955 as 100%, the current vegetable price has risen to 143.62%. Assuming that a family of four needs to eat one dan of vegetables per month, calculated at the price in the first quarter of 1959, this family will pay 9.84 yuan more for vegetables per year than in 1955. If the prices of other non-staple foods also rise, it will inevitably affect the real wages of employees. According to a survey in Fuzhou City, the production profit of vegetables is generally around 50%, and the daily wage of each labor force growing vegetables is around 2.5 yuan, which is five times higher than local rice production. Therefore, the relevant units decided to temporarily stabilize the current prices and gradually reduce them on the basis of production development. This is undoubtedly correct and considers the requirements of the basic socialist economic law and the economic law of distribution according to work.

The main requirement of the economic law of distribution according to work is more pay for more work. The principle of more pay for more work applies not only to the relationship between laborers, but also to the relationship between laborers and the collective or the state. The more labor contributions laborers make to society, the more remuneration they should receive. With the continuous improvement of social labor productivity, workers' labor contributions to society are also increasing. With monetary wages gradually rising, only by stabilizing prices can we ensure that workers receive consumer goods equal to their amount of labor, and can we ensure more pay for more work.

The price issue is very complicated. The above only explains the requirements of several major economic laws that must be considered when setting prices. Please do not hesitate to give your advice on the errors.

    社会主义制度下制定商品价格的客观依据
    肖功达
    社会主义制度下商品的价格是由国家机关制定的，而不是自发形成的。因此，也就产生了一个问题，社会主义制度下的价格有没有客观依据呢？
    制订价格必须以社会必要劳动量为依据
    社会主义制度下的价格也同样是价值的货币表现，它必须以社会必要劳动量为依据。其所以如此，是由社会主义经济的特点所决定的。在社会主义阶段，公有化的程度不同，还存在着全民所有制和集体所有制的差别；生产力的发展水平还没有达到“按需分配”的程度；人们的共产主义觉悟还有待提高，有必要在企业中贯彻社会主义的物质利益原则，实行经济核算等等；因此，企业的产品必须以出售的方式取得补偿，而且是按照社会必要劳动量进行补偿。只有这样，才能够鞭策落后，鼓励进步，促使社会生产力更快发展。对于落后或者是亏赔的企业，如果生产的产品是国家所需要的，可以采取国家暂时补贴或贷款的办法维持其生产，促使其改进经营管理，逐步由亏本走向盈余。斯大林所说的价值规律“是很好的实践的学校”①，其意义也在此。事实说明，只要改善经营管理，许多落后的土法生产的企业也可以赢利。比如福建省沙县红专公社南阳铁厂改进经营管理之后，生铁成本由过去一吨三百一十元降低到一吨一百二十四点七五元，使铁厂由亏蚀走上盈余，一月中净赚七千元零六角。可见，按社会必要劳动量订价和土洋并举的方针是没有矛盾的，相反地会促使土法生产在技术方面和劳动组织方面获得不断改进。如果真有这样的工厂，消耗了人力物力而没有生产效果，那就应当停产、“让路”，把人力物力集中在生产条件较好的工厂里去。这样就能够避免人力物力的浪费，使社会生产效果更好。
    既然制订价格要考虑社会必要劳动量，因此订价时必须有深入细致的工作作风，调查产品的社会必要劳动消耗。一件商品所包含的劳动有以下部分：已消耗的生产资料所体现的过去的劳动，生产过程中工人所新增加的劳动消耗。由于“价格是对象化在商品内的劳动的货币名称”②，因此我们可以从生产资料的价格、工人的工资以及工人创造的上缴给国家的利润和税收几部分的总和得出近似（因为价格和价值常不一致）的社会必要劳动消耗。
    价值规律就是要求商品按社会必要劳动量所决定的价值量进行交换，但这绝不是说商品只能按照社会价值进行交换。在资本主义制度下，由于竞争和无政府状态规律的作用，资本家为了追求利润，大家都愿生产价格较高的产品，结果这种产品供过于求，价格就会下降，甚至下降到价值以下。而另一些原来价格较低的产品，由于大家都不愿生产，结果求过于供，价格就上升，甚至上升到价值以上。价值规律的规律性被无规律性的现象掩盖了，实际上从整个社会来看，从一种商品价格长时期的上涨和下落的平均数来看，价格和价值的总和是相符合的。马克思就曾经说过：“不同诸生产部门的商品依照它们的价值来售卖这一个假定，当然不过意指：它们的价值是一个重心，它们的价格就是围绕着它来变动，并且它们的价格的不断上下涨落，就是均衡为它”③。不仅在资本主义社会而且在社会主义社会，价格和价值也是经常背离的。这种背离的可能性“是存在于价格形态之内的”④，既然价格是价值的货币表现，形式和内容也就可能发生不一致。这种背离产生的原因还由于社会主义特有经济规律的作用（后面有专门论述）。在不同的社会或者同一社会的不同阶段，价格和价值背离的程度和形式是有区别的。在自由竞争占统治的资本主义时代，价格围绕着价值上下自发地波动；社会主义制度下价格和价值的背离则是人们自觉地有计划地实现的；但价格的任何背离都必须围绕着价值，这是价值规律的作用所决定的。价格和价值背离本身不是价值规律的要求，因此，定价时任意地过高或过低的违背价值或者说价格和价值脱节都是违反价值规律要求的，其结果会使生产受到不应有的鼓励或打击。
    有人不适当地过分提高价格来刺激生产，来完成收购任务，这是不对的。比如说，假使禽、蛋的价格过高，农民就不愿意养生猪，而愿意增产禽、蛋，于是生猪的计划遭到破坏，造成生产的片面发展，有的生产太多，有的则生产太少。高价政策还会降低人民的购买力，影响币制的稳定，使企业难以核算，国家制定计划时计算也会发生困难。事实上，有一些收购价格是不低的，但收购任务仍然完不成。比如福建省浦城县木炭的每担收购价为二点三元
  （过去正常的收购价是一点八元），但结果还是完不成收购任务。这说明任何经济工作都应当同政治工作互相结合，价格合理了并不能解决一切问题，还要加强市场管理，对农民进行社会主义的思想教育。
    总之，违反价值规律使价格和价值脱节必然会造成经济生活的混乱，迫使人们把价格向相反的方向调整，使其趋向于价值。这正是价值规律作用的结果。同时也说明价值规律的客观作用是不以人的意志为转移的，它会“强制地贯彻下去，和房屋向人头上倾倒时的重力法则一样”⑤。这种自发作用在资本主义制度下是不可避免的，在社会主义制度下则是由于人们没有认识价值规律的要求而产生的，错误在于人而不在于规律本身。同时也不能把这种自发的作用看成为价值规律本身的消极作用，从某种角度看来，这反而是一种积极作用，因为这种破坏性的作用会使人从反面受到教育，迫使人们改正错误。这不仅对价值规律来说是如此；人们违背社会主义的特有经济规律，比如说国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律，也同样会造成经济生活的混乱，我们当然不能说社会主义特有经济规律也有消极作用。明白了这个道理，才能够不断地提高我们的认识水平，使经济工作获得改进。
    物价工作是政治性很强的工作
    确定价格绝不仅仅是考虑价值规律的要求，如果这样，那么我们只要有一批能够计算的工作人员按照公式进行调查核算就行了。于是，制定价格就纯粹成为一种技术性的工作了，就可以不要政策了。其实，物价工作是政治性很强的工作。社会主义制度下价格的特点不在于它反映价值规律的要求，而在于它反映了社会主义特有经济规律的要求。所以必须要有马克思列宁主义的指导才能做好这个工作。物价工作的困难也在这里。
    社会主义基本经济规律决定社会主义经济的一切主要方面和主要过程，社会主义的流通过程及流通过程中价格的运动也同样为社会主义基本经济规律所决定。社会主义制度下的价格要保证社会主义基本经济规律的实现，也即是要保证发展生产、满足人民的需要。为了发展生产，定价应当保证企业的成本能够得到补偿，而且还要保证企业获得一定的利润，为国家和企业扩大再生产准备必要的积累。这样制定的价格，不但符合基本经济的规律，而且也考虑了生产上的社会必要劳动消耗，所以也是符合价值规律的要求的。最近一个时期，有一些企业存在着单纯的利润观点，不适当地提高产品价格，提高纯利额。这是违背社会主义基本经济规律的，对生产是不利的。从生产者来说，由于产品的售价高，可以很容易地完成产值任务，因此就不努力改善经营管理。高价的产品如果是广大群众所必需的生活资料，则势必影响人民生活水平的提高，这同社会主义基本经济规律所规定的生产目的是相反的。高价的产品如果是生产资料，则势必会增加其他部门的生产成本，从而不利于其他生产部门的发展。当然，定价过低，使企业没有盈余或亏本，对生产也是不利的，同样也是违背社会主义基本经济规律的。（有些情况下，可以例外，见下段）因此，制定价格应当保证企业获得利润，但必须是合理的利润。
    从社会主义基本经济规律出发，对各种产品可以采取高低不同的价格。有一些产品如粮食、棉布、蔬菜等是广大群众的生活必需品，因此价格不能过高，否则劳动群众的必需生活资料得不到满足。其中有一些生活必需品在国家经营时还可能产生亏赔现象。还有一些对国民经济有重大意义的部门，比如许多重工业企业，就是亏本或者暂时不能赢利也得经营。另外，对一些非生活必需品如呢绒绸缎和烟酒等的价格则可以规定得高些，既可以为国家多增加积累，又不致影响广大群众的生活水平。这种情况下制定的价格与价值差距较大，其原因只能用社会主义基本经济规律的作用来说明。但价值规律的作用仍然存在，只不过受到较严格的限制罢了。制定这种较高的价格也同样是要考虑社会必要劳动量的消耗的，谁也不会把一根纸烟的价格定得和一瓶葡萄酒的价格相等。
    在社会主义制度下，随着价格水平的高低，一些产品获利较高，而另一些则获利较低，甚至还有亏本的。但从总的方面和从长远的观点来看，社会主义企业的经营则是赢利的，这正是社会主义赢利的特点，它是由社会主义的公有制所决定的。因为有了社会主义的公有制，所以能够把一些部门的赢利用来补偿另一些低利的部门或者是亏损的部门。由于社会主义的公有制，因此也能够克服私有制度下面那种狭隘的利润观点，同时因为国家集中了大量的财政收入，所以也有能力弥补暂时的亏损。今年5月初，中共福建省委为了密切党群关系，支持农、渔业生产，决定把农、渔业生产资料的价格作适当调整。据估计，商业部门到今年底因此要减少七百二十余万元的收入，其中一部分是要亏赔的，这正是社会主义基本经济规律作用的结果。当然这不是说在社会主义制度下赢利就不足轻重了，一般地说企业尽可能都要赢利，没有个别企业的赢利，也不可能有全面的总的赢利。
    社会主义制度下的价格必须反映国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律
    社会主义制度下的价格还必须反映国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律，这主要是在确定比价的时候要考虑这个规律的要求。比如工农业产品差价的缩小，就可以使农民增加收入，使农业增加投资，从而也刺激农民的生产积极性，促进农业的发展。另一方面，为了不致影响国家工业化资金的积累，工农业产品的差价也只能逐步地缩小。这说明价格问题既关系到工农业按比例的发展，也关系到工农联盟。福建省农村市场农产品交换工业品的比价，1958年比1957年缩小1.22％。各大类农产品采购价格比1957年都略有提高，其中土特产品提高0.3％，经济作物类提高0.31％，油脂油料类提高0.69％，畜、水产类提高1.03％，粮食类提高1.24％。1958年工业品的价格比1957年的价格则略有下降，其中衣著类、日用品类、医药类下降幅度为1.14％到2.67％。为了促进农业生产，防治病虫害，部分农药零售价下降了20％—30％。
    以上仅就两大生产部门的比例来说的，现在再就品种之间的比例和计划来看。比如福建省德化生产的工业瓷收购价格过高，因此瓷厂就偏重于这方面的生产，部分瓷厂已停止生产日用碗类达半年之久，造成日用碗类供应紧张。因此，为了使日用碗类生产计划能够完成，工业瓷和日用瓷的出厂价的差距不能太远。这里也说明，正确地运用价值规律，使价格不要过分的脱离价值，对完成国家的计划是有好处的。但我们之所以要调整瓷器价格，使工业瓷的出厂价不要太高，是因为我们考虑到日用瓷类是人民生活所必需的，是国家计划所规定要生产的，这说明社会主义的特有经济规律对价格具有决定性的作用。价值规律是在社会主义经济规律作用的前提下发挥它的作用。我们不是为利用价值规律而利用价值规律，而是为全面地完成国家计划而利用价值规律，这说明自觉地利用价值规律对社会主义经济会带来好处。
    制定价格还必须考虑供销计划。对生产数量多的商品特别是已经发生积压、滞销的产品价格应当低些，以扩大销售。对一些供不应求的高级消费品的价格则可以高些，以减少人们的需求。也就是说价格水平可以调节人们的需求，使供求大体上平衡，而不致发生严重的积压或脱销现象。但这不是调节供求的唯一办法，对一些供不应求的广大群众所必需的生活用品，则可以采取限量计划供应的办法，使供销大体上一致，而不致造成物价上涨、影响广大群众的生活。
    最后，制定价格还必须考虑到按劳分配的经济规律。实际工资的不断增长是社会主义工资运动的特点。职工实际工资的水平是由货币工资能够购买多少生活资料而定。货币工资的购买力是由物价决定的，在货币工资较固定的情况下，价格水平决定了实际工资的水平。试以蔬菜价格为例。以福州市场1955年蔬菜平均价为百分之百，目前蔬菜价格上升到143.62％。假定四口之家每月需要吃一担菜，按1959年第一季度的价格计算，这个家庭一年要比1955年多付出蔬菜费用九点八四元。如果其他副食品的价格也上涨，则势必影响职工的实际工资。据福州市调查，蔬菜的生产利润一般都在50％左右，种蔬菜的每个劳动日报酬达二点五元左右，高于当地稻谷生产五倍以上。因此有关单位决定暂时稳定现行价格，在生产发展的基础上逐步下调。这无疑是正确的，是考虑到社会主义基本经济规律和按劳分配的经济规律的要求的。
    按劳分配经济规律的主要要求是多劳多得。多劳多得的原则不仅是从劳动者之间来说的，而且也是从劳动者同集体或国家之间的关系来说的。劳动者对社会的劳动贡献越多，报酬也应当越多。社会劳动生产率不断提高，工人对社会的劳动贡献也越来越大。在货币工资逐步上升的情况下，只有稳定物价，才能够保证工人领得与其劳动量相等的消费品，才能保证多劳多得。
    价格问题很复杂。以上仅说明制订价格时必须要考虑的几个主要经济规律的要求。错误之处，请同志们不吝指教。
