    It is Important to Value Basic Skills
    Zhu Jigong
    Recently, many famous and young actors in the Beijing theatrical circles have been persisting in the training of basic skills, which is an extremely gratifying phenomenon.
    For anything, with a good foundation, it can be further improved and developed, and this is even more true for opera art. For example, old Peking Opera artists pay attention to "four skills and five methods" (singing, acting, reciting, fighting; mouth techniques, hand techniques, eye techniques, body techniques, foot techniques), "somersaults," "spins," and "lying fish," all of which require early training; stage presence, "breath control" in singing, and "vigour" also require a solid foundation. These are all valuable experiences gained by artists through long-term artistic practice.
    On stage, an actor's every gesture and movement must achieve "stability, accuracy, and beauty," which is not a matter of overnight success. If we depart from these rules and basic skills, there is no performance to speak of, let alone "art." Some of our young actors are unwilling to put effort into basic skills, wanting to "achieve success at one stroke" or "reach the sky in one step," which is unrealistic. Of course, practicing is quite arduous. The question is what attitude those who aspire to be accomplished actors and artists should take towards it. As the saying goes, "The master leads you in the door, but the cultivation is up to you." Many famous contemporary artists have gone through a process of arduous training.
    Paying attention to the training of basic skills, so that performance techniques can be skilled and used freely, and better express the thoughts and feelings of the characters in the play, is a very important thing for actors. Therefore, whether it is a opera actor, a drama actor, or an opera actor, they all need to work hard to practice their skills, master their skills, and improve their skills. In this way, they can "practice makes perfect," so that art can truly reach a state of perfection and better serve the people.

    要重视基本功
    朱继功
    最近以来，北京戏剧界很多著名演员和青年演员坚持基本功的锻炼，这是极为可喜的现象。
    任何事情，有了良好的基础，就能进一步提高和深造，对于戏曲艺术来说，更是如此。例如，京剧老艺人讲究“四功五法”（唱、做、念、打，口法、手法、眼法、身法、步法）、“跟斗”、“旋子”、“卧鱼儿”都需要幼功；台步、唱工中的“气口”、
  “劲头”等也都要有扎实的根基。这些都是艺人们经过长期艺术实践获得的宝贵经验。
    演员在舞台上，一举手、一投足要求能达到“稳、准、美”，就非一朝一夕之功，如果脱离这些规矩和基本功，就谈不上表演，更谈不上“艺术”了。我们有些青年演员不肯在基本功上下工夫，要想“一蹴而就”，“一步登天”，这是不现实的。当然练功是相当艰苦的。问题在于有志作一个有修养的演员和艺术工作者用什么态度来对待它。俗语说：“师傅领进门，修行在自身”，当代许多有名的艺术家都经历过一番艰苦磨练的过程。
    重视基本功的锻炼，使表演技术能够做到熟练和运用自如，更好地表达剧中人的思想感情，这在演员们说来是很重要的事情。因此，不论戏曲演员、话剧或歌剧演员，都需要苦练技术，掌握技术，提高技术。这样，才能“熟能生巧”，使艺术真正达到炉火纯青的境界，更好地为人民服务。
