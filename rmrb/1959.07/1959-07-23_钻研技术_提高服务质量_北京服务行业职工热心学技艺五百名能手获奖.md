Devoting Efforts to Technology and Improving Service Quality
Beijing Service Industry Workers Enthusiastically Learn Skills, Five Hundred Skilled Workers Receive Awards

(Our newspaper dispatch) The Beijing Commercial and Service Industry Business Technology Performance Meeting concluded on the 20th, with more than five hundred skilled workers receiving awards for excellent service quality. This was a general review of the Beijing finance and trade system workers' active learning of business technology; in order to improve service quality, more than one hundred thousand workers have participated in this kind of learning in the recent two months.

This large-scale business technology performance lasted for ten days. The performance content was varied and rich, with a total of one hundred and eighty-eight items including packaging goods, accounting, counting money, measuring cloth, butchering meat, hairdressing, pedicure, photo coloring, washing, dyeing, and mending. The skilled techniques displayed by the experts in the performance were well received by the audience. Shang Jian'an, a salesperson from Ruifuxiang Cloth Store, demonstrated cloth measuring skills. Holding the ruler in his right hand and pulling the cloth with his left, the cloth flowed down like a waterfall when he measured quickly. It only took thirty seconds to measure eighty feet of cloth, and the measurement was accurate to the inch. Zhou Shijie, a master chef from Hengsheng Restaurant, was able to make two thousand and forty-eight strands of dragon beard noodles from half a kilogram of flour in one minute and twenty-five seconds and four tenths of a second, with a total length of more than nine thousand city feet.

The business and technical studies of the Beijing finance and trade system began in early May. For more than two months, the majority of employees have been diligently studying and practicing to continuously improve their operational skills and enrich their professional knowledge. Tang Junchuan, a salesperson at Xidan Vegetable Market, was previously not proficient in his skills. When scooping half a kilogram of sesame paste, it took five or six scoops with a small spoon to get the correct amount. If three customers wanted to buy sesame paste, they had to queue up and wait. In order to change this situation, Tang Junchuan practiced scooping sesame paste hundreds of times every night. Now, he has developed a set of skills where his "eyes are scales and his hands are the weight." After many employees master one skill proficiently, they systematically learn multiple skills.

In the business learning, the veteran workers of all walks of life, on the one hand, strive for perfection themselves, and on the other hand, serve as mentors, passing on their years of accumulated experience to others. Wu Renlin, a coloring technician at China Photography Studio, created a coloring method that directly colors the photos, which is one and a half times faster than before, saves a lot of raw materials, and the colors are more vivid.

    钻研技术  提高服务质量
    北京服务行业职工热心学技艺五百名能手获奖
    本报讯　北京商业和服务行业的业务技术表演会20日闭幕，五百多个能手获得服务质量好的优胜奖状。这是北京财贸系统职工积极学习业务技术的一次总检阅；为了提高服务质量，十多万职工在最近两个多月内参加了这种学习。
    这次大规模的业务技术表演，举行了十天。表演内容五花八门，丰富多采，共有包货、算账、点钞、量布、剔肉、理发、修脚、照相上色、洗染织补等一百八十八个项目。能手们在表演中所显示的熟练技巧，受到了观众的好评，瑞蚨祥布店的售货员尚建安表演量布技术，他右手拿尺，左手拉布，量得快的时候，布像瀑布一样往下泄流。量完八十尺布，只用了三十秒钟，重量一次，一寸不差。恒升饭馆的老师傅周士杰在一分二十五秒四的时间内，能将一斤水面做成二千零四十八条龙须面，总长九千多市尺。
    北京财贸系统的业务技术学习是从5月初开始的。两个多月来，广大职工勤学苦练，不断提高操作技术，丰富业务知识。西单菜市场的售货员唐俊川，过去技术不熟练，打半斤芝麻酱，用小勺打五、六下分量才能准确。有三个顾客买芝麻酱，就得排队等候。唐俊川为了改变这种情况，每天晚上都练习打酱几百次。现在，他已经练成一套“眼是戥子手是秤”的本领。许多职工熟练地掌握一种技能以后，便有步骤地学习多种技能。
    各行各业的老师傅在业务学习中，一面自己精益求精，一面担任导师，把多年积累的经验传授给别人。中国照相馆上色技师吴壬麟，创造了直接在照片上配色的上色方法，效率比过去快一倍半，节省了不少原料，而且色彩更加鲜艳。
