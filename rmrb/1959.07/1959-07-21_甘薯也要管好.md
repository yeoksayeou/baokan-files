Sweet Potatoes Must Also Be Managed Well
Strengthening field management of sweet potatoes and increasing yield per unit area is an important measure for striving for increased sweet potato production at present. Many places, while strengthening field management of other crops, also attach great importance to the field management of sweet potatoes, even comparing sweet potatoes to rice, launching a vigorous movement to increase production of "thousand-catty rice and ten-thousand-catty sweet potatoes," and striving for an overall increase in grain production. This approach is correct.

Sweet potato is a crop with high yield and considerable nutritional value. According to analysis, every catty of fresh sweet potato contains about 145 grams of carbohydrates, 11.5 grams of protein, and 1 gram of fat. People usually consider four catties of sweet potatoes equivalent to one catty of grain, but the calories produced by four catties of sweet potatoes are 45% higher than one catty of rice or white flour, 40% higher than one catty of corn, and 35% higher than one catty of millet. In addition, sweet potatoes taste delicious and are loved by everyone. Even when fine grains completely satisfy people's needs, sweet potatoes are a very good supplement. At the same time, sweet potatoes are also an important livestock feed, and even sweet potato vines are good feed. The protein and fat contained in sweet potato vines are more than in sweet potato tubers, and livestock love to eat them. If we calculate 200 catties of sweet potato vines per mu, 10,000 mu would be enough for 450 head of livestock or 1,100 pigs to eat for a year. In the past, farmers mainly relied on a cellar of sweet potatoes and a pile of bran to raise pigs until they were very fat.

There is a farming proverb that says, "Each household plants 1.8 mu of sweet potatoes, and they have food, clothing, and money to spend." This is a fair evaluation of sweet potatoes. Because sweet potatoes are not only good food and feed, but also a widely used raw material for light industry. Sweet potatoes contain a lot of starch, and starch is an indispensable material for the textile industry and the manufacture of medicines. Sweet potatoes made into maltose are the main raw material for candies, pastries, breads, biscuits, and other foods in the food industry. In the winemaking industry, 100 catties of dried sweet potatoes can produce about 7 catties more wine than 100 catties of sorghum or corn. In addition, they can also be used to make soy sauce, vinegar, and so on. From this point of view, sweet potatoes are indeed important materials indispensable to national construction and people's lives, and should not be neglected or underestimated in the slightest.

Sweet potatoes have strong adaptability, are easy to grow, and require less labor in cultivation and management than crops such as rice and peanuts. This is a favorable condition for developing sweet potato production. However, one cannot therefore think that the field management of sweet potatoes is unimportant, and that one can harvest regardless of management, and thus relax field management. According to last year's experience, under the same planting conditions, the yield can vary by 20-30% or even more depending on the quality of management. Taking a yield of 4,000 catties per mu as an example, good management can result in an extra 1,000 catties. Taking the nearly 200 million mu of sweet potatoes nationwide, this would amount to an extra 200 billion catties. Two hundred billion catties of sweet potatoes converted into grain is equivalent to 50 billion catties, which is a huge number!

The main measures to strengthen field management of sweet potatoes are topdressing fertilizer and intertillage and weeding. In the past, people generally did not topdress sweet potatoes much. This is a traditional habit of extensive cultivation and a reason hindering rapid yield increase. The ten to forty days after planting sweet potatoes is the early stage of tuber formation, and grasping this period to apply topdressing fertilizer has a great yield-increasing effect. Fertilization should focus on applying organic fertilizers. Organic fertilizers can improve the soil and promote the activity of microorganisms in the soil, providing a continuous supply of fertilizer, which is especially beneficial to tuber crops. Intertillage enables sweet potatoes to form more tubers earlier under conditions of adequate air and moisture and concentrated fertilizer. Currently, it is the rainy season, with rampant weeds. Summer sweet potato vines have already been placed in the ditches, and spring sweet potato vines have already covered the ground. All localities should immediately combine weeding and loosening the soil with timely intertillage and fertilization, and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of tuber crops.

### 甘薯也要管好

    甘薯也要管好
    加强甘薯田间管理，提高单位面积产量，是当前争取甘薯增产的一项重要措施。很多地方在加强其他作物田间管理的同时，也很重视甘薯的田间管理，甚至把甘薯和水稻相提并论，开展轰轰烈烈的千斤稻万斤薯增产运动，争取粮食全面增产。这种作法是正确的。
    甘薯是一种产量高、营养价值也相当高的作物。据分析：每斤鲜薯约含碳水化合物一百四十五克，蛋白质十一克半，脂肪一克。人们通常以四斤甘薯折一斤粮食，而四斤甘薯所产生的热量，比一斤大米或者白面高45％，比一斤玉米高40％，比一斤小米高35％。再加上甘薯味道可口，人人爱吃，即使在细粮完全满足人们生活需要的时候，甘薯也是一种很好的调剂品。同时，甘薯还是重要的牲畜饲料，连薯藤也是很好的饲料，薯藤中所含的蛋白质和脂肪比薯块还多，牲畜很爱吃。如果以亩产薯藤二百斤计算，一万亩就够四百五十头牲畜或者一千一百口猪吃一年。过去农民养猪主要就靠一窖薯和一囤糠，把猪养得滚肥。
    有句农谚叫做“每户种薯一亩八，有吃有穿有钱花”。这是对甘薯的公正评价。因为甘薯不仅是很好的粮食和饲料，更是用途很广的轻工业原料。甘薯含有很多淀粉，淀粉是纺织工业和制造药品不可缺少的材料；甘薯制成饴糖，更是食品工业中糖果、糕点、面包、饼干等的主要原料。在制酒工业中，一百斤薯干比一百斤高粱、玉米要多出酒七斤左右。此外，还可以制酱油、醋等等。由此看来，甘薯实在是国家建设和人民生活中不可缺少的重要物资，不应丝毫有所忽视或轻视。
    甘薯的适应性较强，容易生长，比之水稻、花生等作物在栽培管理上用工也要少些，这是发展甘薯生产的一个有利条件。但不能因此认为甘薯的田间管理无关紧要，管不管都能收，因而就放松田间管理。根据去年经验，在相同种植条件下，管理得好坏，产量可以相差两三成甚至更多。以亩产四千斤计算，管理得好，就能多收一千斤；以全国近二亿亩甘薯来说，就可以多收二千亿斤。二千亿斤甘薯折成粮食合五百亿斤，这是一个多么巨大的数字！
    加强甘薯田间管理的主要措施，是追肥和中耕、除草。过去各地一般对甘薯是不大追肥的。这是耕作粗放的传统习惯，也是妨碍产量迅速提高的一个原因。甘薯在栽种后的十天到四十天中，正是薯块形成前期，抓紧这个时期追肥，有很大增产效果。施肥应多施有机肥料，有机肥料既能改良土壤，又能促进土壤内微生物的活动，源源供应肥料，对块根作物特别有利。中耕能使甘薯在空气水分适量、肥分集中的条件下，早结和多结薯块。目前正值雨季，杂草丛生，夏薯薯藤已经下沟，春薯薯藤已经铺地，各地要立即结合除草、松土及时进行中耕和施肥，争取薯类全面大丰收。
