    Equal Pay for Equal Work, Passing on Production Techniques, Arranging Living Benefits
    Women Work Full Attendance and Are More Energetic
    Tangjiang Commune Completes Early Rice Harvesting Task Ahead of Schedule

    Our Ganzhou, July 26th Dispatch: The experience of Tangjiang Commune in Nankang County, Jiangxi Province, proves that fully mobilizing women's enthusiasm for production is an effective way to solve the current difficulties of insufficient labor during the "double抢" (rush harvest and planting).

    Before the start of harvesting and planting, Tangjiang Commune conducted a thorough assessment of the commune's labor force and harvesting and planting tasks. It was found that the harvesting and planting area had increased by more than 3,000 mu compared to last year, while the labor force was relatively lacking. According to the commune's harvesting and planting plan, the entire commune was short approximately 10,000 workdays.

    When tapping into labor potential, the commune discovered that among the more than 8,000 women semi-laborers in the entire commune, some women had low attendance rates and low work efficiency. According to the commune's calculations, if 90% of the 8,000 female laborers attended work every day, the commune's harvesting and planting labor force would change from being insufficient to having a surplus. Therefore, the commune immediately conducted an in-depth investigation into the reasons for the low attendance rate and low work efficiency of women, and found that there were three reasons affecting women's work:

    First, although men and women do the same labor, the remuneration for women's labor is relatively low, which is not very reasonable; second, some women believe that "field work is heavy and difficult, and is something for men to do," and their thinking has not been completely liberated; third, most women lack production techniques.

    In response to the above three reasons, the commune first focused on the Pingtian Production Team and organized ten young women to form a "Quick Harvest and Fast Planting Clever Sisters Group," and appointed two old farmers to be specifically responsible for imparting harvesting, threshing, plowing, and transplanting techniques. After five days of training, this group was used as a model to organize women production team leaders and some women to come and visit and learn. Then, each production team, under the topic of "How Women Can Play a Role in Summer Harvesting and Summer Planting," organized women to conduct large-scale debates. During the debate, everyone was educated by the typical facts of the "Quick Harvest and Fast Planting Clever Sisters Group," dispelled the idea that "women cannot do field work," and thus boosted their enthusiasm and unanimously expressed that they would compete with men. After the meeting, women from each team formed combat teams, ready to devote themselves to the harvesting and planting campaign.

    On the basis of improving ideology and establishing organizations, the commune also adopted three measures to solve the problems of remuneration and production technology. First, rationally adjust labor remuneration. The commune stipulates that recording work points and giving remuneration should not be based on gender, but only on the amount of work done, the quality, and the work attitude. Second, organize old farmers to teach production techniques to women. Each women's combat team is equipped with one or two old farmers as instructors, who teach, learn, and do on the spot in the fields, imparting harvesting and planting techniques on site. Third, properly arrange women's living benefits, improve the organization of farm busy season canteens and nurseries, so that women have ample time to participate in production. The commune also stipulates that pregnant women and women during their menstrual periods should not do heavy farm work or work in paddy fields.

    Due to the earnest implementation of the above measures, the enthusiasm of women in Tangjiang Commune for production has been unprecedentedly high. Out of more than 360 women in the entire brigade, only more than 100 regularly attended work in the early stage. In this harvesting and planting campaign, all of them attended work. They formed 31 combat teams, contracted for harvesting, threshing, drying, and transporting into the warehouse, averaging 19 dan of rice harvested per day, keeping pace with the men's teams. Eight women from Aiban Brigade created a record of harvesting 29 dan of rice in one day, surpassing the men. Dong Zhaodi, a female commune member of the Fifth Team of Pingtian Brigade, used to only do some sporadic work. Now, through hard study and hard work, she has mastered the operating techniques of important farm work such as threshing, plowing, and harrowing. She actively takes the lead in harvesting and planting, and her work efficiency is high, earning nine work points every day. According to commune statistics, the attendance rate of more than 8,000 young and middle-aged women in the entire commune has reached an average of 98% every day; 6,500 women have learned a complete set of production techniques such as harvesting, threshing, plowing, harrowing, and transplanting. The commune recently held a summer harvest and summer planting competition and selected 1,500 labor models and advanced producers, of which women accounted for 1,000. On average, one out of every eight young and middle-aged women in the entire commune is a labor model or advanced producer.

    Due to the active participation of women in production, Tangjiang Commune completed the entire harvesting task of 18,000 mu of early rice five days ahead of schedule. 10,000 mu of the more than 20,000 mu of late rice fields have been transplanted with seedlings, and the remaining paddy fields have also been plowed and harrowed three times, and it is estimated that the summer planting task can be completed three days ahead of schedule.

### 男女同工同酬　传授生产技术　安排生活福利  妇女出全勤　干活更有劲  唐江公社提前完成早稻收割任务

    男女同工同酬　传授生产技术　安排生活福利
    妇女出全勤　干活更有劲
    唐江公社提前完成早稻收割任务
    本报赣州26日电　江西南康县唐江公社的经验证明：在解决当前
  “双抢”劳力不足的困难中，充分调动妇女的生产积极性，是一项有效的办法。
    收种开始前，唐江公社对全社劳动力和收种任务做了一次摸底算账，发现收种面积比去年增加了三千多亩，而劳力却比较缺乏，按照公社收种计划需要，全社大约缺少一万个劳动日。
    公社在挖掘劳动潜力时，发现全社现有的八千多名妇女整半劳动力中，有些妇女出勤率低、工效不高。据公社计算，如果八千个女劳力的90％天天出勤，全社收种劳力就会由不足变有余。于是，公社立即对妇女出勤率低、工效不高的原因作了深入调查，发现有三个原因影响妇女出工：
    一是男女虽然同样劳动，但给妇女劳动的报酬比较低，不甚合理；二是有些妇女认为“田头活又重又难，是男人做的事情，思想还没有彻底解放；三是大部分妇女缺乏生产技术。
    针对上述三个原因，公社首先以平田生产队为重点，组织十个青年妇女成立了一个“快收速种巧姐妹组”，指定两个老农专门负责传授割禾、打禾、犁田、莳田等收种技术。经过五天训练后，以这个组为榜样，组织妇女生产队长和部分妇女前来参观学习。然后，各生产队以“妇女怎样在夏收夏种中发挥作用”为题。分别组织妇女开展大辩论。辩论中，大家受到了“快收速种巧姐妹组”的典型事实教育，破除了“妇女不能干田头活”的思想，从而鼓起了干劲，一致表示要和男子汉比高低。会后，各队妇女纷纷成立了战斗小组，准备投入收种运动。
    在提高了思想、建立了组织的基础上，公社又采取了三条措施解决报酬、生产技术等问题。一是合理调整劳动报酬。公社规定：记工分给报酬不以男女性别为依据，只以干活多少、质量高低、劳动态度为凭证。二是组织老农向妇女传授生产技术。每个妇女战斗小组配备一、两个老农担任教导员，在田头边教边学边做，现场传授收种技术。三是妥善安排妇女生活福利，健全农忙食堂、托儿所组织，使妇女有充裕的时间参加生产。公社并规定：怀孕和月经期妇女不干重农活和不下水田。
    由于认真执行了上述措施，唐江公社妇女生产积极性空前高涨。全大队三百六十多个妇女，前期只有一百多人经常出勤，这次收种运动中全部出了勤。她们分别组成三十一个战斗小组，包割、包打、包晒、包运进仓，平均每天收割十九担谷，与男子组并驾齐驱。隘阪大队八个妇女，创造一天收割二十九担谷的最高纪录，赛过了男子汉。平田大队第五小队女社员董招娣，过去只会做些零星活，现在艰学苦钻，已掌握了打禾、犁田、耙田等重要农活的操作技术，她在收种中积极带头干工效高，每天都得到了九个工分。据公社统计：全社八千多个青壮年妇女的出勤率，平均每天都达到了98％；有六千五百名妇女学会了割禾、打禾、犁田、耙田、莳田等全套生产技术。公社最近举行了一次夏收夏种评比，评选了一千五百名劳动模范和先进生产者，其中妇女占一千名。全社平均每八个青壮年妇女中就有一个劳动模范或先进生产者。
    由于妇女积极参加生产，唐江公社提前五天完成了一万八千亩早稻的全部收割任务，二万多亩晚稻田中已有一万亩插上秧苗，其余稻田也犁耙了三次，估计可以提前三天完成夏种任务。　（刘光辉）（附图片）
