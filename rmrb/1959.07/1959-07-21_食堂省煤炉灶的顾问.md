Reforming canteen stoves is one of the effective measures to save civilian coal. In order to widely introduce and facilitate the collective canteens to organize and promote advanced experience in saving coal, the Coal Industry Publishing House has published a book entitled "Coal Saving Methods for New Stoves in Collective Canteens".

This booklet was compiled by Comrades Li Jingyu and Wang Rong, and introduces five new types of coal-saving stoves: horseshoe-shaped ventilation stove, double-linked stove (burning anthracite), coal-wood dual-purpose self-draft stove, double-eye return-air stove, and anthracite self-draft stove. These stoves were successfully created by the comrades of the military's cooking staff after dozens of experiments and modifications. They have been promoted in many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and have achieved good results. These stoves make full use of the fuel's thermal energy, allowing the fuel to be completely burned, which plays a significant role in saving fuel. For example, calculated by the average amount of coal needed per person per day: horseshoe-shaped ventilation stove uses 2.3 taels; double-eye return-air stove uses 1.8 taels; double-linked stove uses 4.3-4.6 taels. Canteens using these stoves save one-half or three-quarters of coal compared to the past.

    食堂省煤炉灶的顾问
    改造食堂的炉灶，是节约民用煤的有效措施之一。煤炭工业出版社为了广泛地介绍和便于集体食堂组织推广节约用煤的先进经验，特出版了一本“集体食堂新型炉灶省煤法”的书籍。
    这本小册子是李靖宇和望荣同志编写的，介绍了五种新型省煤炉灶：马蹄形通风灶、连二灶（烧无烟煤）、煤柴两用自来风灶、双眼回风灶和无烟煤自来风灶。这些炉灶是军队上的炊事员同志，经过数十次实验、修改，成功地创造了这五种新型省煤炉灶，已在中国人民解放军不少单位中推广，效果很好。这些炉灶充分利用燃料的热能，使燃料得到完全燃烧。对节约燃料起了重大作用。如以平均每人每天需要煤量计算：马蹄形通风灶为二点三两；双眼回风灶为一点八两；连二灶为四点三一四点六两，采用这些炉灶的食堂都比过去节省用煤二分之一或四分之三。
