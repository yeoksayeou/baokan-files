Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 2nd: Under the strong leadership of the Party, the people in the disaster-stricken areas of Guangdong Province are making every effort to restore production and rebuild their homes.

The Party and the state have given tremendous support to the people in the disaster areas to restore production and rebuild their homes. After the flood disaster occurred, the State Council immediately allocated funds and rice for flood relief. As soon as the rescue work was over, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately made comprehensive arrangements to solve the food and housing problems of the people in the disaster areas, and immediately mobilized a large number of transportation forces to transport grain to the disaster areas. Now, houses are being repaired everywhere in the disaster areas. Zengkou People's Commune in Zengcheng County mobilized more than 200 people, including masons, carpenters, and shed builders from the less severely affected areas within the commune, to help the people in the severely affected areas to rush to repair temporary housing using the original bricks, tiles, and wood from the collapsed houses. Within five days, more than 1,000 households whose houses had collapsed were provided with shelter. Leadership organs at all levels from the province to the county have sent a group of medical personnel to the disaster areas to treat diseases, so that sick victims can quickly regain their health.

On the basis of gradually arranging their lives, the victims in various places have heroically put forward the slogan of action: "Retreat one inch of water, advance one inch of production." At present, they are using their main strength to rush to repair water conservancy, restore embankments and block breaches, and vigorously grasp late-season production. In the seven disaster-stricken counties in the Dongjiang, Zengjiang, and Liuxi River basins in the Foshan Special District, 650,000 people are currently mobilized for production every day. As of June 25, these areas have repaired more than 12,000 large and small water conservancy projects; in areas where floods receded earlier, the late rice planting work has been completed by 80%. Huaxian and Baoan counties have completed all of it. At the same time, various localities organized part of the labor force to rush to harvest early rice, early-maturing crops, and develop sideline production. In just a few days, Heyuan County and Haifeng County harvested nearly 60,000 mu of early rice and early-maturing crops. The sideline production that has been carried out includes fishing, vegetable growing, raising chickens and ducks, and weaving bamboo and wood products. In the past five days, the sideline income of four people's communes in Zengcheng County has reached more than 25,000 yuan.

The people in the affected areas are also seizing the time to plant early-maturing crops and miscellaneous grains, and fully implement the policy of self-reliance in production. The people in the disaster areas of Huiyang County decided that in addition to completing the late-season planting task, each person would plant an average of half a mu each of sweet potatoes, miscellaneous grains, and early-maturing crops. Heyuan County has organized 268 reclamation teams to reclaim more than 15,000 mu of wasteland for planting sweet potatoes and rice. Zengcheng County has specifically revised the late-season production targets and measures from the commune to the brigade, proposing to strive to make up for the early-season losses with the late-season harvest and harvest enough grain for the whole year in one season.

Since the disaster occurred, disaster relief and production headquarters have been established in various places one after another. From the district party committee to the brigade party branch, the secretary takes the lead, and effective measures are taken to lead the victims to carry out self-reliance in production. The leading cadres at all levels, who have been sharing weal and woe with the masses in the struggle against floods, are now joining the masses in self-reliance in production. The exemplary actions of Party members and cadres of many people's communes and production brigades have greatly encouraged the morale of the people in the disaster areas. They said: With the leadership of the Communist Party, we are not afraid no matter how big the disaster is. At present, from the province to the people's commune, comfort groups and work teams led by leading cadres have been organized to go deep into the severely affected areas to help and lead the people to overcome difficulties. Non-disaster areas, and even mildly affected areas, throughout the province have also promoted the noble spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation of "saving people as if saving oneself." Shantou, Zhanjiang, Jiangmen and other special districts supported the severely affected Foshan Special District with more than 2 million jin of grain seeds and a batch of vegetable seeds, ducklings, and goslings. In the severely affected Huiyang and Zengcheng counties, the communes also actively supported each other. Eight non-disaster and mildly affected people's communes in Huiyang County did their best to provide grain seeds, farm tools, cattle, and food rations to support the severely affected areas. The victims expressed with emotion that they would repay this deep friendship with practical actions to restore production.

    党的领导　国家支持　生产自救　相互支援
    广东灾区全力恢复生产重建家园
    新华社广州2日电　广东省受灾地区的人民，在党的坚强领导下，正在全力恢复生产，重建家园。
    党和国家对灾区人民恢复生产、重建家园的工作，给予了巨大的支持。洪水灾害发生后，国务院立即拨来了抗洪救灾款和大米。抢救灾民的工作刚一结束，中共广东省委立刻就解决灾区人民的吃、住问题作了全面的安排，马上动员大批运输力量，把粮食运到灾区。现在，灾区各地正在抢修房子。增城县增口人民公社发动社内轻灾区的泥水匠、木匠、搭棚匠等二百多人，帮助重灾区人民利用倒塌房子的原有砖瓦木料抢修临时住房，五天内就使一千多户房子倒塌了的灾民获得居室。从省到县各级领导机关，都已派出一批医务人员深入灾区治病，使有病的灾民迅速恢复健康。
    在逐步安排生活的基础上，各地灾民豪迈地提出了“水退一寸，生产前进一寸”的行动口号。他们目前正在用主要力量抢修水利，复堤堵口和大抓晚造生产。在佛山专区东江、增江、流溪河流域的七个受灾县里，目前每天都有六十五万人出动生产，到6月25日止，这些地区已经修复大小水利工程一万二千多处；在洪水消退较早的地区，晚稻播种工作已完成80％，花县和宝安两县已经全部完成。与此同时，各地组织了部分劳动力抢收早稻、早熟作物和开展副业生产。仅河源县和海丰县在几天之内便抢收了早稻和早熟作物近六万亩。已开展的副业生产有打鱼、种菜、饲养鸡鸭、编织竹木器等。增城县四个人民公社近五天来的副业收入已达两万五千多元。
    各受灾地区人民还抓紧播种早熟作物和杂粮，充分贯彻生产自救的方针。惠阳县灾区人民决定除了完成晚造播种任务以外，平均每人再种番薯、杂粮、早熟作物各半亩。河源县已经组织垦荒队二百六十八个，开垦荒地一万五千多亩，用来种番薯和水稻。增城县从公社到大队都具体地修订了晚造生产指标和措施，提出要争取晚造夺回早造损失，一造收足一年粮。
    从发生灾情开始，各地便先后成立了救灾生产指挥部，从地委直到大队党支部都由书记挂帅，采取有效措施来领导灾民进行生产自救工作。在抗洪斗争中一直和群众共生死的各级领导干部，现在又和群众一道转入生产自救。许多人民公社、生产大队的党员和干部的模范行动，大大鼓舞了灾区人民的斗志。他们说：有共产党领导，灾再大我们也不怕。目前，从省到人民公社都已组织了由领导干部率领的慰问团和工作组，深入各重灾区帮助和领导人民克服困难。全省各地的非灾区，以至轻灾区，也都发扬了“救人如救己”的崇高的互助协作精神。汕头、湛江、江门等专区支援了重灾区佛山专区二百多万斤谷种和一批菜种、鸭苗、鹅苗等。在重灾区的惠阳和增城县，各公社之间也互相积极支援。惠阳县八个非灾和轻灾的人民公社，都尽可能地拿出谷种、农具、耕牛、口粮等来支援重灾区。灾民们感动地表示，要用恢复生产的实际行动来答谢这种深情厚谊。
