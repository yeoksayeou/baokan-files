The grasslands present a completely fresh appearance, and the new generation blossoms like spring shoots.
Manxita loves the commune like home, and takes special care in his herding.

    This newspaper reports that in the Sujitan People's Commune of Menyuan County, Qinghai Province, a song like this is often heard:

    Sujitan Commune has a Manxita,
    No one can compare to his herding skills;
    The sheep are like his flesh and blood,
    His work is outstanding, and he loves the commune like home.

    Manxita is an outstanding shepherd of the merino sheep experiment group of the Sujitan People's Commune. He is only twenty-three years old this year, but he has been herding sheep for fifteen years. He is now responsible for feeding and releasing the merino sheep experiment group, which has a total of 700 ewes. This year, 703 winter lambs were produced, all of which survived and are healthy, creating an excellent achievement of 100.42% winter lamb breeding survival rate.

    The unprecedented success of the merino sheep experiment group under Manxita's care is of course inseparable from his years of accumulated herding experience, but more importantly, it is due to his high sense of responsibility in establishing the commune as his home and caring for the lambs.

　　　　　Raising the Sheep Well

    In September 1958, the commune established a merino sheep experiment group. The commune party committee decided to let Manxita be responsible for feeding and releasing them. Manxita felt that his responsibility was even greater. He secretly made up his mind: he must raise the sheep in the experiment group well!

    According to past practice, the grasslands were only divided into areas by season. However, once the sheep reached the pasture, they often ran around and ate indiscriminately, and most of the grass was trampled. The sheep could not eat good grass, which not only made it difficult to maintain their condition, but also affected breeding. Manxita thought about it and finally came up with a good solution—dividing the areas into blocks, that is, dividing each season's pasture into four blocks and using the "cannibalization" method of grazing, eating this block and then eating that block, and demarcating the sheep's round-trip passages. In this way, the grassland was fully utilized, and the sheep could eat good grass every day.

    In winter, the days are short and the nights are long, and the sheep cannot eat enough by grazing only during the day. Manxita discussed it with his partner Jiang Fawa and others, and decided to implement the "double eight, double four" rotation grazing method day and night, that is, grazing for eight hours, resting for four hours, then grazing for eight hours, and then resting for four hours. This way, people are a little tired, but Manxita thought: "What is there to fear from being a little tired! As long as the sheep can maintain their condition, that's all that matters." As a result, in the past winter and spring, 98% of the sheep in the experiment group were grade A condition, and no sheep died due to weakness. Since then, merino sheep have become "fat in autumn, plump in winter, and strong in spring" in their area.

    Before and after the ewes give birth, it is the busiest time for Manxita and his partners. In addition to day and night rotation grazing, in order to keep the ewes healthy and give birth smoothly, it is also necessary to supplement them with fodder, oil dregs, and salt regularly. After the sheep began to give birth, he lined up the ewes about to give birth into groups during the day and carefully fed and released them; at night, he quietly guarded the pen, ready to receive the lambs at any time. As soon as a lamb was born, he hurriedly sent it to his own tent, lit a fire to warm the lamb. When he went out to graze, he was afraid that the little lambs would get tired, so whenever he went up or down the mountain, he would hold the smallest lambs in his arms, put them in bags, and carry them on his back. Some ewes had little milk after giving birth, so he patiently fed the sheep with milk.

    The peak of lambing was in the coldest days of winter, and the lambs often had diarrhea after being born. Manxita thought, could it be that the lambs have diarrhea because they can't stand the cold? Let's try to find some medicine to dispel the cold. So, he boiled brown sugar, dates, and fennel soup to give the lambs. This try was indeed effective, and most of the lambs with diarrhea recovered.

　　　　　Advancing towards Science

    The unprecedented success of the merino sheep experiment group under Manxita's care was praised by all the commune members. However, he himself still felt dissatisfied. He always felt that his cultural level was low and he lacked scientific knowledge. To be a qualified shepherd, he must understand science. Therefore, he actively participated in the commune's amateur veterinary training class and amateur middle school. This was a heavy burden for a person with a low level of education to learn so many courses at once. But Manxita did not flinch at all. He studied whenever he had time, and used what he learned, asking veterinary personnel and people who knew more than him anytime, anywhere. At present, Manxita's cultural level has reached junior high school level, and his veterinary disease prevention and control technology is equivalent to that of a graduate student of a secondary veterinary school. Now, he can treat more than ten kinds of livestock diseases such as lamb dysentery, external parasites, brain hydatid disease, and foot rot, and has mastered subcutaneous injection and intramuscular injection techniques. Every day when he goes out to graze, Manxita carries various medicines and medical equipment with him so that he can treat the sheep at any time.

　　　　　Going to Beijing with Honor

    Since Manxita started herding sheep for the mutual aid group in 1952, and then herding sheep for the pastoral cooperative and the people's commune, he has always been diligent, conscientious, and responsible for eight years, and his production performance has been getting better year by year, and his sense of responsibility has become stronger and stronger. Therefore, he has maintained the honorary title of outstanding shepherd for several years, and once went to Beijing with the honor given to him by the Party and the people to attend the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference and the National Youth Congress.

    万里草原气象新　一代新人如春笋
    满西塔爱社如家精心放牧
    本报讯　在青海省门源县苏吉滩人民公社里，常常听到这样一首赞歌：
    苏吉滩公社有个满西塔，
    牧羊本领谁也比不上他；
    羊群好比是他的连心肉，
    工作出色一心爱社如家。
    满西塔是苏吉滩人民公社绵羊试验群的一位出色的放牧员，今年才二十三岁，但牧羊工龄却已有十五年了。他现在负责饲放的绵羊试验群，共有七百只母羊，今年产冬羔七百零三只，全部成活，个个健壮，创造了冬羔繁殖成活率100.42％的优异成绩。
    满西塔负责饲放的绵羊试验群能够出现这样空前的成绩，固然是与他常年积累的放牧经验分不开，但更重要的，还是他树立了以社为家，爱护羊羔的高度的责任心。
          把羊群养好
    1958年9月份，公社建立了绵羊试验群。公社党委决定让满西塔来负责饲放。满西塔觉得自己的责任更大了。他暗暗地下了决心：一定要把试验群的羊养好！
    按照以往的惯例，在草原上只是按季划片。但羊群一到草场上，往往乱跑乱吃，大部分草都被踏坏了。羊吃不到好草，既不容易保膘，也影响到配种。满西塔想来想去，终于想出了个好办法——按片分块，即把每一季度的草场再划成四块，用“蚕食”的办法放牧，吃了这块再吃那块，并划出了羊群来回的走道。这一来，草原得到了充分利用，羊每天都能吃到好草。
    冬季里，白天短黑夜长，单靠白天放牧羊吃不饱。满西塔就和他的伙伴姜发娃等商量，决定实行昼夜“双八、双四”轮牧方法，即放牧八小时，休息四小时，再放牧八小时，再休息四小时。这样做，人是累一点，但满西塔却想：“累一点怕什么呢！只要羊膘能保好就行。”结果，在去冬和今春的季节里，试验群的羊有98％都是甲等膘，没有一只羊因体弱死亡。从此绵羊在他们这里成为“秋肥、冬胖、春健壮”了。
    在母羊产羔前后，是满西塔和他的伙伴们最繁忙的时期。除了昼夜轮牧以外，为了使母羊体质健壮，顺利产羔，还要定时补饲草料、油渣和食盐。羊群开始产羔以后，白天他把临产的母羊排队分群，精心饲放；夜里，他便静守在圈旁，随时准备接羔。羊羔一产下来，就赶忙把它送进自己住的帐房，生火替羊羔取暖。出去放牧时，他生怕小羊羔跑累了，每逢上山、下坡，就把最小的羊羔抱在怀里、装在袋里，背上、背下。有的母羊产羔后奶少，他便耐心地用牛奶喂羊。
    产羔盛期，正是数九寒天，羊羔产下后往往拉痢。满西塔想，羊羔拉痢莫非是受不了冻吧？找点驱寒的药试试看。于是，他就用红糖、枣子、小茴香熬汤给羊羔灌。这一试，果然灵验，拉痢的羊羔大部分都好了。
            向科学进军
    满西塔负责饲放的绵羊试验群出现了空前未有的成绩，受到全体社员的赞扬。但他本人却仍然感到不满足。他总觉得自己的文化水平低，又缺乏科学知识，要作一个合格的放牧员，必须懂得科学。于是，他又积极地参加了公社举办的业余兽医训练班和业余中学。这对一个文化不高的人来说，一下子学那么多课程，负担是够重的。但满西塔却毫不退缩，他有空就学，学了便用，随时随地的向兽医人员和比他懂得多的人请教。目前，满西塔的文化水平已达到初中程度，兽疫防治技术相当于中等兽医学校的毕业学生。现在，他已能治疗羔痢、外寄生虫、脑包虫和腐蹄等十多种畜病，并掌握了皮下注射和肌肉注射技术。每天外出放牧，满西塔都带着各种药品和医疗器械，以便随时给羊治病。
      带着光荣上北京
    满西塔从1952年给互助组放羊以来，接着为牧业社、人民公社放羊，八年如一日，始终勤勤恳恳，认真负责，生产成绩一年比一年好，责任心也越来越强。因此，几年来他一直保持着优秀放牧员的光荣称号，曾带着党和人民给他的荣誉，上北京出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会和全国青年代表大会。
