Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 26th: According to a report in the Cuban newspaper "Hoy," Salvador Allende, President of the Popular Action Front of Chile, who was invited to attend the Havana Farmers' Congress, called for a Latin American People's Congress to discuss strengthening the unity of Latin American countries and breaking free from imperialist rule.

In an interview with a "Hoy" reporter, Allende pointed out that the congress should mainly discuss the following fundamental issues: Latin American unity, breaking away from the colonial system, and the unity of the Latin American workers' and peasants' movement. He said, "This congress will help the Cuban revolution, not because the congress is convened for this purpose, but because the Cuban revolution represents the aspirations of the people of our colonial, underdeveloped countries."

Referring to the foreign ministers' conference of the twenty-one American countries to be held in Santiago, Chile, in mid-August, Allende said that the attitude taken by Venezuela and Cuba should be supported by truly democratic countries. There are clearly two paths: either the "Organization of American States" remains the same, or it is reorganized and imposes economic and moral sanctions on dictatorial regimes. He said, "At this foreign ministers' conference, political and economic issues will be discussed in a new language for the first time. As a Chilean, I believe that our Chilean people will closely watch everything that is put forward at the meeting, and the Chilean people have already made their voices heard: the people's representatives oppose the entry of representatives of dictatorial regimes into the Chilean parliament."

Allende expressed the Chilean people's warm support for the Cuban revolution, saying, "The Chilean people clearly know that the problem in the Caribbean region is a problem for the entire Americas... The Cuban revolution represents the aspirations of the colonial peoples and the peoples of our countries. Cuba's land reform has opened up a new path for our Latin America." Allende condemned the U.S. conspiracy of interference, pointing out that the United States should understand that now is the time to coexist with Latin America in a different way. The Latin American people demand that their sovereignty and right to self-determination be respected, they do not want colonialism, and they demand that they no longer be single-product economies.

Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Buenos Aires Dispatch: Yesterday, many people gathered in front of the monument to Argentine national hero San Martin in the Argentine capital to express their support for the Cuban revolution.

This activity was organized by the Argentine "Committee to Support the Cuban Revolution." A spokesman for the committee said, "We will fight back against any attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the Cuban people and guarantee moral and material support for the Cuban cause. Because this is the common cause of the peoples of Latin American countries." The spokesman said that if a war of aggression occurs, "our answer will be to send thousands of volunteers... to resolutely respond to the call of the Cuban people."

He also said that the upcoming meeting of American foreign ministers "should clearly stipulate in its resolutions that it will not interfere in Cuba." He demanded that Argentina's representative take this position at the meeting, and also demanded that the Argentine representative support the proposal put forward by Cuba and Venezuela to expel the Dominican Republic from the "Organization of American States."

The committee spokesman also stated that they advocate the establishment of a "Latin American Center" to work to make people more aware that "liberation from the shackles of imperialism is a fundamental condition for improving the material and spiritual lives of the peoples of all countries."

    拉丁美洲人民站在古巴一边
    阿伦德表示智利人民反对干涉古巴
    阿根廷人民坚决支持古巴革命事业
    新华社哈瓦那26日电　据古巴“今日报”报道，应邀参加哈瓦那农民大会的智利人民行动阵线主席阿伦德号召举行拉丁美洲人民代表大会，讨论加强拉丁美洲各国的团结和摆脱帝国主义的统治等问题。
    阿伦德在同“今日报”记者的谈话中指出，代表大会主要应讨论下列几个根本问题：拉丁美洲的团结、摆脱殖民体系和拉丁美洲工农运动的团结问题。他说，“这次大会会有助于古巴革命，这并不是因为这次大会是为此目的召开的，而是因为古巴革命表现了我们殖民地不发达国家人民的热望。”
    阿伦德在谈到8月中旬将在智利圣地亚哥举行的美洲二十一国外长会议时说，委内瑞拉和古巴所采取的态度应该得到真正民主国家的支持。显然是有两条道路：“美洲国家组织”仍然老样不改，或是进行改组并对独裁政权实行经济和道义上的封锁。他说，“在这次外长会议上将用一种新的语言谈论政治和经济，这还是第一次。作为一个智利人，我相信，我们智利人民将密切注视会上提出来的一切，智利人民已经发出了他们的声音：人民的议员反对独裁政权的代表进入智利议会。”
    阿伦德表示了智利人民对古巴革命的热烈支援，他说，“智利人民清楚地知道，加勒比地区的问题就是全美洲的问题……古巴革命表现了殖民地人民和我们各国人民的愿望。古巴的土改为我们拉丁美洲开辟了一条新道路。”阿伦德谴责了美国的干涉阴谋，他指出，美国应该懂得，现在已经是用另一种方式与拉丁美洲共处的时候了。拉丁美洲人民要求他们的主权和自决权受到尊重，他们不要殖民主义，并且要求不再是单一经济生产国。
    新华社27日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷首都昨天有很多人在阿根廷民族英雄圣马丁纪念像前集会，对古巴革命表示支持。
    这个活动是由阿根廷“支持古巴革命委员会”组织的。委员会的发言人表示，“我们将反击干涉古巴人民内政的任何企图，并保证在道义上和物质上支持古巴的事业。因为这是拉丁美洲各国人民的共同事业”。发言人说，如果发生侵略战争，“我们的回答是派遣数以千计的志愿军，……坚决地响应古巴人民的号召。”
    他又说，即将举行的美洲外长会议“在它的决议中应该明确规定不干涉古巴”。他要求阿根廷的代表在会上采取这一立场，同时还要求阿根廷代表支持古巴和委内瑞拉提出的把多米尼加共和国开除出“美洲国家组织”的主张。
    委员会发言人还表示，他们倡议成立一个“拉丁美洲中心”来进行工作，使人们更加认识到“从帝国主义枷锁中解放出来是改善各国人民物质和精神生活的基本条件”。（附图片）
