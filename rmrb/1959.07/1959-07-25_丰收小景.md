A harvest vignette:

    Boundless expanse connects with white clouds,
    Wind rises, waves surge, people appear,
    Sickles dance, the sea empties,
    In an instant, the "sea" is dry, the "mountain" rises into the clouds.
    A dragon of vehicles rolls, smoke billows,
    Loaded with laughter, loaded with gold,
    Thousands of granaries, ten thousand storage, all filled,
    The tail of the dragon stretches far, not yet entering the village.

    丰收小景万里汪洋连白云，风起波伏现人群，镰刀挥舞大海倾，顷刻“海”干“山”入云。车龙滚滚烟雾腾，满载欢笑满载金，千仓万囤尽装满，龙尾遥遥未进村。
