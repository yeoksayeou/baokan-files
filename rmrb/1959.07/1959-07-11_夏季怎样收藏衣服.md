    How to Store Clothes in Summer
    In summer, people need to properly store away cotton, wool, fur, and other clothes that are not currently being worn. If they are not properly stored, they can easily become moldy (develop spots), deteriorate, and be eaten by insects, damaging the fibers.
    To prevent mold and deterioration, pay attention to the following points before storing:
    1.  Cotton, wool, fur and other clothes that have been worn must be washed clean of oil and dirt before storage. It is best to use warm water for washing, and do not soak them in water that is too hot. Do not rub or pull the clothes horizontally with force during washing; instead, gently rub them along the vertical grain to avoid damaging the elasticity of the clothes and causing deformation. After washing, dry them in a shady place, and do not expose them to strong sunlight to avoid fading.
    2.  After the clothes are dried and smoothed, place some mothballs or naphthalene powder (wrapped in small paper packets) inside the clothes to kill bacteria, insects and prevent moths. Then clean the wardrobe and clothes cabinet, spread a layer of moisture-proof paper or kraft paper, and then put the clothes inside.
    3.  The temperature of the storage location should not be too high, generally not exceeding 33 degrees Celsius. It is best to store them in a ventilated, cool, and dry place. The wardrobe and clothes cabinet should be raised higher from the ground, such as with bricks and wooden boards, be sure to place the wooden boards on top of the bricks. Houses near the kitchen, in low-lying, humid and hot areas, or where salt or caustic soda has been stored are not suitable for storing clothes.

    夏季怎样收藏衣服
    夏天，人们都要把穿不着的棉、呢、毛、皮等衣服妥善地收藏起来。如果保管不好，就很容易发生霉坏（长斑点）变质和虫咬，损伤纤维等现象。
    为了防止霉坏变质，在收藏以前应注意做到以下几点：
    一、凡是穿过的棉、呢、毛、皮衣等，在收藏以前一定要将油垢洗涤干净。洗涤时最好用温水，不要用过热的水浸泡，洗的过程中切勿用力横搓横拉，应依直纹轻轻搓揉，这样不致损伤衣服的弹性和引起变形。洗涤以后放在阴凉地方晾干，不要放在强烈的阳光下曝晒，以免褪色。
    二、把衣服晾干、理平以后，要在衣服里夹放点卫生球或萘粉（用纸包成小包），以杀灭菌虫、防止蛀蚀。然后把衣箱、衣柜清扫干净，铺垫一层隔潮纸或牛皮纸，再把衣服放在里边。
    三、存放地点的温度不宜过高，一般以不超过三十三度为宜，同时最好是放在通风、阴凉和干燥的地方。衣箱、衣柜要垫得距离地面高一些，如用砖和木板垫时，要把木板放在砖的上面。靠近厨房、地势低洼、潮湿闷热以及存放过盐、火碱的房屋不适于存放衣物。
