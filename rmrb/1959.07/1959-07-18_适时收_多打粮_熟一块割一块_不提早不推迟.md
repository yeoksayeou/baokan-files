This newspaper, Changsha, 17th dispatch: Xiangyin and Hengnan counties in Hunan province are paying close attention to grasping the opportune moment during early rice harvesting, ensuring timely harvesting to make the rush harvesting work more practical and detailed, and increase grain yield.

Entering July, the more than 30,000 mu of early rice in the Dongtingwei Commune of Xiangyin County was a sea of gold. At this time, the commune's Party committee, based on the experience of losses caused by premature harvesting of early rice last year, proposed implementing measures appropriate to local conditions and time, dividing the fields into different categories, and having the work teams harvest when the rice turned yellow and ripe. However, many production teams, fearing insufficient labor arrangements, advocated opening the sickle for harvesting as early as possible. The commune Party committee then designated two mu of seemingly ripe fields in the Ninth Production Team for trial harvesting and threshing. The results showed that there were still a large number of green grains inside, with a yield of only more than 400 jin per mu. If the harvest was delayed by another two days, the early-maturing grains would not fall off, but about 30 jin more could be harvested. The commune Party committee immediately held an on-site meeting in the fields, using last year's experience and the current facts to educate cadres not to rush the harvest prematurely. At the same time, it specifically formulated timely harvesting plans for each team and work group. On July 10th, the entire commune began harvesting according to the newly revised plan. The initial acceptance results showed that the yield of timely harvesting was higher than that of the earlier harvests in the previous days.

The Hengnan County Party Committee, based on years of experience and lessons learned, believes that early rice varieties and natural conditions vary, and the maturity time is inconsistent. In the past, some communes and brigades rigidly stipulated a uniform harvesting time, which inevitably led to the phenomenon of ripe grains falling off and green spikes being difficult to thresh. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions and take production teams and work groups as units to harvest at the appropriate time. Currently, all 20-plus communes in the county have made plans field by field with production teams and work groups as units, arranged the labor force, and are harvesting and threshing carefully according to the principle of harvesting one field when it turns yellow to ensure that every grain of early rice is brought into the granary; and seizing the opportunity to promptly transplant late rice.

    适时收　多打粮
    熟一块割一块　不提早不推迟
    本报长沙17日电　湖南省湘阴和衡南县在收割早稻中，十分注意掌握时机，适时收割，使抢收工作做得更切实细致，多打粮食。
    进入7月，湘阴县洞庭围公社的三万多亩早稻已一片金黄。这时公社党委根据去年过早收割早稻造成部分损失的经验，提出因地因时制宜，分类划片，由作业组掌握，黄一块，收一块，熟一块、收一块。但是，不少生产队害怕劳力安排不及，主张尽早开镰收割。公社党委便在第九生产队划出两亩看去似已黄熟的田试收试打，结果发现里面还有大量的青谷，每亩产量只有四百多斤；如再迟两天收割，早熟颗不会掉粒，却能多收三十斤左右。公社党委立即在田头召开了现场会议，用去年的经验和眼前的事实，教育干部不要过早抢收；同时具体拟订了各队、各作业组适时收割的计划。到7月10日，全社按新订计划开镰，当天收了一百多亩，初步验收的结果，适时收割的产量都比前几天早收的高。
    中共衡南县委根据历年的经验教训，认为早稻品种和自然条件不一样，成熟时间不一致，过去有些公社和大队硬性规定统一的收割时间，势必产生熟透掉粒和青穗扮不脱粒现象，因此必须因地制宜，以生产队、作业组为单位，适时收割。现全县二十多个公社都以生产队、作业组为单位，逐丘作好规划，安排好了劳力，本着黄一丘、割一丘的原则，细收细打，保证早稻颗粒归仓；并抓紧时机，及时插好晚稻。
