The Seventh World Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship Festival is being held in Vienna, the capital of Austria, from July 26 to August 4.

The World Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship Festival was initiated by the World Federation of Democratic Youth at its Paris Council meeting in July 1946, after the end of World War II. The first festival was held in the summer of 1947. Since then, it has been held every two years. The festival is a peaceful and friendly gathering for young people and students of different beliefs, nationalities, and races from all countries. The World Federation of Democratic Youth has organized all previous festivals. The purpose of the festival is to promote friendship, cooperation, and cultural exchange among young people from various countries, and to mobilize young people to fight for the relaxation of international tensions and lasting peace.

This world youth festival attracts tens of thousands of young people. Its influence is also becoming more profound. The first festival was held in Prague in 1947, with more than 17,000 young people from 71 countries participating. The second festival was held in Budapest in 1949, with more than 10,000 young people from 82 countries participating. The third festival was held in Berlin in 1951, with 26,000 young people from 104 countries participating. The fourth festival was held in Bucharest in 1953, with 30,000 young people from 111 countries participating. The fifth festival was held in Warsaw in 1955, with more than 30,000 young people from 114 countries participating. The sixth festival was held in Moscow in 1957, with more than 30,000 young men and women from 131 countries participating. This seventh festival has nearly 17,000 representatives from about 1,200 youth and student organizations in more than 120 countries participating. Young people and students from our country have participated in all previous festivals.

The festival's idea—peace and friendship—is receiving increasingly widespread response.

During the festival, there is a central activity related to peace, friendship, and solidarity every day; there are also wonderful artistic and cultural programs from young people from the five continents. In addition, youth friendship sports games will be held. Our country has sent a youth sports delegation of 21 people to participate in the festival, including a youth table tennis team of four men and women and a Nanjing youth men's basketball team of twelve people, most of whom are emerging new forces in recent years.

    世界青年联欢节
    第七届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节7月26日到8月4日在奥地利首都维也纳举行。
    世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节是第二次世界大战结束后，由世界民主青年联盟在1946年7月巴黎理事会会议上决定发起的。在1947年夏天举行了第一届联欢节。以后每二年举行一次。联欢节是各国不同信仰、不同民族和种族的青年和学生和平友好的节日。历届联欢节都是世界民主青年联盟组织的。联欢节的目的是促进各国青年的友谊合作与文化交流，动员广大青年为缓和国际紧张局势、争取持久和平而斗争。
    这个世界青年的联欢节日吸引着成千上万的青年。它的影响也一次比一次深远。第一届联欢节1947年在布拉格举行，参加这届联欢节的有七十一个国家的一万七千多名青年。第二届联欢节1949年在布达佩斯举行，有八十二个国家的一万多名青年参加。第三届联欢节是1951年在柏林举行，有一百零四个国家的二万六千名青年参加。第四届联欢节是1953年在布加勒斯特举行，有一百一十一个国家的三万名青年参加。第五届联欢节是1955年在华沙举行，有一百十四个国家的三万多名青年参加。第六届联欢节是1957年在莫斯科举行，有一百三十一个国家三万多青年男女参加。这次第七届联欢节有一百二十多个国家约一千二百个青年和学生组织的近一万七千名代表参加。我国青年和学生的代表参加了历届的联欢节。
    联欢节的思想——和平和友谊——得到越来越广泛的反应。
    在联欢节期间，每天都有一项有关和平、友谊和团结的中心活动；同时还有五大洲青年的精彩的文艺活动节目。此外还将举行青年友谊运动会。我国派遣了由21人组成的青年体育代表队参加联欢节，代表队中包括一支由四人组成的青年男女乒乓球队和一支由十二人组成的南京市青年男子篮球队，他们大多数是近年来涌现出的新生力量。
