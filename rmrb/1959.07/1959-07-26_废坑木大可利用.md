To the Editor:
　　Coal mines are heavy users of timber. Producing one thousand tons of coal consumes one to two cubic meters of pit props. Due to the large consumption of pit props, there is also a significant amount of waste pit props and scrap material from making pit props. Chengzi Mine in western Beijing has a very low pit prop consumption rate, but even so, there is still much potential for utilizing waste wood. For example, there is still wood buried in the gangue piles, as well as some waste pit props and scrap wood underground, and some sawdust and scraps at the wood processing site.

　　I think it's a pity that this wood is not being fully utilized. Other things can be made quickly, but wood takes a certain number of years to mature, and China has a relative shortage of forests. Wood has to be transported over long distances after it is felled, so we should pay close attention to saving wood.

　　At Chengzi Mine, I once asked the relevant departments, and it was said that for a period of time, Beijing was short of firewood. The Coal Construction Company came to the mine to purchase waste wood, and the mine actively supported it at that time. Every worker would bring back a piece of wood after work, but they stopped buying it later. I find it strange, why don't they continue to buy it? Some of this wood can be used to make tables and benches, or at least firewood. Waste pit props can also be used as raw materials for papermaking. Therefore, I suggest that the Coal Construction Company, paper mills, and other departments regularly contact coal mines to purchase those waste pit props and the scrap left over from making pit props, and make reasonable use of them.

### 废坑木大可利用

    废坑木大可利用编辑同志：
    煤矿是用木材很多的部门，生产一千吨煤就要消耗一、二十立方米坑木。坑木消耗量大，废坑木和做坑木的废料也多。京西城子矿是坑木消耗量很低的一个矿，即使这样，利用废木料仍是大有可为。例如，矸石堆里还有被埋着的木头，井下还有些废坑木、废木料，木料加工场地也有些锯末、碎料等。
    我觉得，这些木材没有充分利用很可惜。别的东西还可以赶制，唯有木材成材要经过一定的年限，而且我国森林比较缺，木头采伐了还要经过长途运输，我们应该很好地注意节约木材。
    在城子矿，我曾经问过有关部门，据说有个时期，北京市缺劈柴，煤建公司来矿上收购过废木料，那时矿上也积极支持，每个工人下班都捎块木头上来，但是以后就不收购了。我很奇怪，为什么不继续收购呢？这些木料，有的可以做桌子、凳子，至少可以做劈柴，废坑木还可以作造纸原料。因此，我建议煤建公司、造纸厂等部门经常和煤矿联系，把那些废坑木和做坑木剩下的废料收购起来，合理利用。
