Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 30th – The basic construction of the first phase of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation has entered a new stage of fighting for steel and materials.

	The twenty-eight steelmaking projects centered on No. 1 open-hearth furnace are under full-scale construction. Dozens of silver-gray factory steel pillars stand tall on the construction site. Two giant tower cranes swing their giant arms day and night, hoisting steel beams and metal roof trusses. Various refractory bricks from all over the country are continuously transported to the site for the construction of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace body. The civil engineering of various auxiliary facilities of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace has been basically completed, and metal components and equipment are about to be installed. The primary rolling mill, known as the "throat" of the rolling mill system, officially started construction on July 28 and will soon enter the full-scale construction phase.

	The eight engineering companies responsible for the construction of the open-hearth furnace have now mobilized their best construction forces to the site. Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's responsible cadres and Soviet experts are constantly going to the open-hearth furnace site to understand the situation and solve key problems in construction. The workers have also changed from a two-shift system to a three-shift system, with machines running non-stop, day and night. The employees of various construction units are enthusiastically discussing construction plans and formulating specific measures, and a socialist labor competition is about to be launched.

	The Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation officially started construction in August 1957. By July 14th of this year, when No. 2 blast furnace produced iron, 125 engineering projects in the ironmaking system of the first phase have been completed or basically completed, except for a coke oven and five projects such as the ore dressing plant and sintering plant which are under construction. Most of them have been put into production. These 120 projects include seven major plants and mines: Daye Iron Mine, Lingxiang Iron Mine, Niaolongquan Limestone Dolomite Mine, Ore Dressing Plant, Sintering Plant, Coking Plant, and Ironmaking Plant, as well as power, water supply and drainage, railways, highways, and so on. Construction workers are currently installing two rows of flotation machines and two sintering machines in the ironmaking system, and the third row of flotation machines and No. 3 and No. 4 sintering machines will also be installed successively. They are determined to complete the construction of all sintering plants and ore dressing plants of the first phase of the ironmaking system in the shortest possible time to ensure high-quality and high-yield of the two blast furnaces.

	The Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Party Committee recently comprehensively analyzed the basic construction situation and decided to concentrate superior forces on the construction of the open-hearth furnace in the second half of this year, start the construction of the rolling mill system, and at the same time use part of the forces to complete the unfinished projects of the first phase of the ironmaking system. The construction task in the second half of the year is very heavy. The Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Party Committee calls on construction workers to continue to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, not only to put various projects into production on schedule and ahead of schedule, but also to resolutely implement the policy of "a major plan for a century, quality first" to ensure that the quality reaches excellent. In addition, we must vigorously save building materials, do a good job in material management, and regularly clean up warehouses to make the best use of everything.

    集中优势力量建设平炉和轧钢系统
    武钢二十八项炼钢工程全面施工
    炼铁的工程已有一百二十项基本建成
    新华社武汉30日电　武汉钢铁公司第一期工程的基本建设，已进入为钢为材而战的新阶段。
    以一号平炉为中心的二十八个炼钢工程项目已经全面施工了。几十根银灰色的厂房钢柱巍然屹立在工地上。两台巨型塔式吊车日夜挥动巨臂，吊装着钢梁和金属屋架。来自全国各地的各种耐火砖源源运到现场，供砌筑一号平炉炉体使用。一号平炉的各项辅助设施的土建工程都已基本完成，即将安装金属构件和设备。被称为轧钢系统的“咽喉”的初轧厂，已在7月28日正式开工建设，不久将进入全面施工阶段。
    担负建设平炉的八个工程公司，目前都已纷纷调集优秀的施工力量前往工地。武钢负责干部和苏联专家们都不断前往平炉工地了解情况，解决施工中的关键问题。工人们也由两班制改为三班制，歇人不歇机械，日夜施工。各施工单位的职工正在热烈讨论施工计划，拟订具体措施，即将掀起社会主义劳动竞赛热潮。
    武汉钢铁公司从1957年8月正式开工建设，到今年7月14日二号高炉出铁为止，第一期工程中炼铁系统的一百二十五个工程项目，除了一座焦炉和选矿厂、烧结厂等五个项目正在建设以外，其他一百二十个项目已经建成或基本建成，绝大部分投入了生产。这一百二十个项目，包括大冶铁矿、灵乡铁矿、鸟龙泉石灰石白云石矿、选矿厂、烧结厂、焦化厂、炼铁厂七大主体厂矿，和动力、供水排水、铁路、公路等等。建设工人们目前正在安装炼铁系统的两列浮选机和两台烧结机，第三列浮选机和三、四号烧结机也将陆续安装。他们决心在最短时期内，将第一期炼铁系统的烧结厂和选矿厂全部建成，确保两座高炉实现优质高产。
    武钢党委最近全面分析了基本建设情况，决定今年下半年集中优势力量建设平炉，开始建设轧钢系统，同时以一部分力量将炼铁系统第一期未完工程建成。下半年施工任务十分繁重，武钢党委号召建设工人们继续开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，不仅要使各项工程按期和提前投入生产，而且要坚决贯彻“百年大计，质量第一”的方针，保证质量达到优等。此外，要大力节约建筑材料，做好材料的管理工作，定期清理仓库，使物尽其用。
