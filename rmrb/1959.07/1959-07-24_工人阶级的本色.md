    The True Qualities of the Working Class
    Fang Weibai
    The report on Chen Xiaofa, Li Shaokui and other comrades from the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, who faced danger without fear and protected the plant during a crisis, published in the People's Daily on July 23, is inspiring.
    As the saying goes, true gold fears no fire. Only through severe trials can true heroes emerge. Chen Xiaofa, Li Shaokui and other comrades were already recognized as excellent workers in the plant; after this fiery test, even more noble qualities were revealed in them.
    They were selfless for the public good. They knew very well that oxygen cylinders are extremely prone to explosion when exposed to high temperatures, and the power of one oxygen cylinder explosion is equivalent to that of a heavy bomb. At that time, twenty or thirty oxygen cylinders were placed together, and if they were soaked in steel slag and exploded, the danger would be unimaginable! Precisely for this reason, they determined that they must not leave, and even if they were to sacrifice themselves, they had to carry out the rescue. This selflessness for the public good, putting their personal safety aside, is better described not as "self-forgetfulness," but as them becoming the embodiment of the working class defending the interests of the country, transforming the "small self" into the "great self." This is a brilliant communist spirit! Their noble qualities of the working class were appropriately expressed.
    They were fearless in the face of danger. Steel slag at a temperature of one thousand degrees Celsius was rushing towards the place where the oxygen cylinders were placed, and the situation was extremely critical. They remained steadfast in their rescue efforts. Fear will inevitably lead to wavering and escape, which has nothing in common with the fearless character of the working class. Their spirit of dauntlessness, in addition to possessing the noble quality of selflessness for the public good, was also due to their confidence in victory.
    They were courageous and resourceful. They are all steelworkers with more than ten years of experience and know what method to use to reduce the temperature of steel slag. Great courage is accompanied by great wisdom, and composure is needed to cope with sudden events. They first threw sand, then sprinkled water, and finally connected a water pipe to cool the red-hot steel slag. At a moment of life and death, they eliminated the great explosion that would have occurred in an instant. Such miracles can only come from the hands of the world-creating working class, whose experience in fighting against nature contains infinite wisdom and strength.
    The heroic deeds of Chen Xiaofa, Li Shaokui, and others naturally make people feel proud: This is the true quality of the working class!

    工人阶级的本色
    方韦白
    7月23日人民日报上刊登了鞍钢第一炼钢厂陈效法、李绍奎等临危不惧、抢险护厂的报道，令人振奋。
    俗话说，真金不怕火炼。只有经过严重的考验，才能显出真英雄。陈效法、李绍奎等同志，平时就是全厂公认的优秀工人；经过这次烈火般的考验，从他们身上显示出更为崇高的品格。
    他们为公忘私。他们深知，氧气瓶遇着高温极容易爆炸，一个氧气瓶爆炸的威力顶上一个重磅炸弹。当时，二三十个氧气瓶放在一起，万一受钢渣浸泡而爆炸，它的危害不堪设想！正因为如此，他们认定，决不能走开，即使自己遭到牺牲，也非抢救不可。这种为公忘私，把个人生命安全置之度外，说是“忘我”，倒不如说他们成了捍卫国家利益的工人阶级的化身，把“小我”化为“大我”了。这是光辉的共产主义风格！他们的工人阶级的高贵品质获得应有的表现。
    他们临危不惧。一千度高温的钢渣向放置氧气瓶的地方涌去，情况危急万状。他们坚定不移地抢救到底。畏惧必将带来动摇和逃跑，这和工人阶级的勇者不惧的性格毫无共同之点。他们的大无畏精神，除了由于具备为公忘私的高贵品质，还由于他们有着必胜的信心。
    他们勇而有谋。他们都是有十多年工龄的钢铁工人，熟知降低钢渣温度该用什么办法。有大勇才有大智，能镇定才能应付突然事件，他们始则扬沙，继则泼水，终以接通水管把通红的钢渣浇冷却。千钧一发的时刻，他们把毁灭于顷刻的大爆炸消灭了。这类奇迹，只能出诸于创造世界的工人阶级之手，他们和自然作斗争的经历中，蕴藏着无穷的智慧和力量。
    陈效法、李绍奎等的英雄事迹，自然地使人们感到自豪：这正是工人阶级的本色！
