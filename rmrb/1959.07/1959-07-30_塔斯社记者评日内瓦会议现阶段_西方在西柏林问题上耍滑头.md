Xinhua News Agency, July 29th, dispatch from Geneva: A TASS correspondent in Geneva reports: According to Swiss newspapers, the foreign ministers decided in private talks on the 27th that after careful consideration on the 28th, both sides would put forward concrete suggestions on the issues discussed.

Many Swiss newspapers portray the situation as if the Western countries' delegations have taken new steps conducive to reaching an agreement on the Berlin issue, saying that the British delegation has played a special role in this regard. However, in this extremely optimistic tone, there is no answer to such a simple and natural question: Where exactly are the Western countries, especially Britain's, attempts to reach an agreement reflected? What constructive modifications have they made to the proposals they put forward on the West Berlin issue on June 16th?

Thoughtful observers who believe in action rather than words answer that there are no modifications. Moreover, this is what informed journalists are talking about: on the main issue, namely the reduction of the number of occupying troops in West Berlin, Lloyd's attitude has apparently worsened due to pressure from Bonn. If he had previously said in his speeches that the issue of reducing the number of occupying troops could be a subject for discussion, now he has completely echoed his American and French partners, saying that there is no question of any reduction. The heads of the Western countries' delegations have repeatedly stated in plenary sessions that the situation in West Berlin cannot be considered normal. But in reality, all their proposals are aimed at maintaining the old system in West Berlin.

Herten's speech in West Berlin on July 25th most bluntly demonstrated this point. His speech, which thoroughly retained the atmosphere of the worst period of the "Cold War," was supported by the shameless West German militarist and revanchist groups. It is this speech, rather than Herten's repeated pious assurances in Geneva of his willingness to seek a basis for reaching an agreement, that makes people see the true position of the United States on the West Berlin issue.

It is true that the Western representatives insist that while they insist on retaining the current number of occupying troops in West Berlin, they are accommodating the Soviet Union on other issues. According to reporters, the Western representatives even repeated this reason in the talks on the 27th, saying that their proposals on June 16th were intended to bring about some improvement in the situation in West Berlin. But is this really the case?

The Western countries have stated that they are not prepared to arm their troops in West Berlin with atomic weapons and rocket weapons, but they have not done so before. So where is the concession?

The United States, Britain, and France have expressed their willingness to meet the Soviet Union's demands on the issue of West Berlin planning and directing slanderous propaganda and sabotage activities against socialist countries. But in fact, their proposals did not mention this issue, but rather proposed to take measures to deal with the fictitious problem of undermining the social order of "the two parts of Berlin." That is to say, using vague wording to replace a clear change in the situation.

The world's public expects the United States, Britain, and France not to use tricks and play cunningly, but to take some real measures on the road to reaching an agreement.

    塔斯社记者评日内瓦会议现阶段
    西方在西柏林问题上耍滑头
    据新华社29日讯  塔斯社日内瓦28日讯：塔斯社驻日内瓦特派记者报道：据瑞士各报报道，外长们27日在私下的会谈中已经作出决定，双方在28日经过仔细考虑以后将对所讨论的问题各自提出具体建议。
    许多瑞士报纸把事情说成是，似乎西方国家代表团采取了某些有助于就柏林问题达成协议的新步骤，说英国代表团在这方面起了特别的作用。但是，在这种极其乐观的论调中，却找不到对于这样一个简单而又自然的问题的回答：西方国家，特别是英国，达成协议的尝试实际上表现在哪里？它们对自己在6月16日就西柏林问题提出的建议作了哪些建设性的修改呢？
    善于深思熟虑、相信行动，而不偏信言词的观察家回答说，没有任何修改。而且，在消息灵通的新闻界人士中也正在这样谈论着：在主要的问题上，即在减少西柏林占领军人数的问题上，劳埃德显然由于受到波恩的压力，态度甚至变坏了。如果说，从前他在自己的发言中还说过，减少占领军人数的问题可以作为讨论的对象，那么现在，他已经完全附和自己的美国和法国伙伴，说谈不上什么裁减了。西方国家代表团团长在全体会议上发言时不止一次亲自说过，西柏林的局势不能认为是正常的。但是，实际上，他们的一切建议都是为了使西柏林的制度保持老样子。
    7月25日，赫脱在西柏林发表的讲话最露骨地表明了这点，他的这个彻头彻尾保持着“冷战”最坏的时期的气息的讲话，得到无耻的西德军国主义和复仇主义集团的拥护。正是这次讲话，而不是赫脱在日内瓦屡次提出的愿意谋求达成协议基础的虔诚的保证，使人认清了美国在西柏林问题上的真正立场。
    不错，西方代表硬说什么他们一方面坚持保留西柏林目前的占领军人数，另一方面则在其他问题上迎合苏联。据记者们说，西方代表甚至在27日的会谈中还重复了这个理由，说什么他们6月16日提出的建议是为了使西柏林的局势有某些好转。可是，真是如此吗？
    西方国家表示不准备用原子武器和火箭武器武装它们在西柏林的军队，但是它们以前也并没有这样做。那么让步又在哪里呢？
    美国、英国和法国表示愿意在关于西柏林策划和指示对社会主义国家进行诬蔑宣传和间谍破坏活动这个问题上满足苏联的要求。但是，事实上，在它们的建议中并没有提到这个问题，而是提出要采取措施对付破坏“柏林两个部分”的社会秩序这个虚构的问题。这就是说，用含糊不清的措词来代替对局面的明确改变。
    全世界公众期待美国、英国和法国不要使用诡计和玩弄狡猾手腕，而要在达成协议的道路上采取一些真正的措施。
