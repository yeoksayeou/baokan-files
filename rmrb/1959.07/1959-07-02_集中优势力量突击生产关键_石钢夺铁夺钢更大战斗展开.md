Concentrating Superior Forces to Focus on Key Production
Shijingshan Steel Launches a Greater Battle to Seize Iron and Steel

(Our Newspaper) The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company has made arrangements for steel production in the third quarter. In this crucial quarter, the company's employees put forward the slogan "Seize the opportunity, work hard for three months, and greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day with outstanding production achievements."

The production level of major products such as steel at this company has greatly increased in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year. For example, the total output value increased by 38%, pig iron increased by 20%, and steel was twice the annual output last year. This is a great leap forward. However, about two-thirds of the annual production tasks still need to be completed in the second half of the year. Whether the production level can be significantly improved in the crucial third quarter has become a prominent issue to ensure the completion of the annual task.

After careful discussion and calculation, based on objective possibilities, the company proposed that the steel production level in the third quarter should increase by 14% compared with the previous quarter, and the pig iron production level should increase by 15% compared with the previous quarter. Achieving this plan will lay a solid foundation for completing the annual task.

In order to rapidly improve the level of steel production, the company decided to concentrate superior forces to complete the relevant major measures, such as one of the key issues to increase pig iron production is the shortage of coke supply. The company decided to concentrate its efforts to rapidly build the Hongqi No. 3 coke oven and complete the relevant projects of the third coke oven to increase coke production.

The demand for increased production levels will inevitably lead to an increase in transportation volume, and higher requirements are also put forward for equipment maintenance. In order to ensure smooth transportation within the factory, the company's leaders personally organized forces to conduct in-depth investigations and studies, and decided to take measures such as expanding the scope of fixed points, improving the utilization efficiency of locomotives and vehicles and mechanical equipment, and close cooperation between production departments and transportation departments to make transportation work keep up with the needs of production development.

The company also decided to continue to improve and implement various rules and regulations in the third quarter. For example, in view of the hot weather and heavy rain in the third quarter, employees are organized to learn technical operating procedures and safety procedures, and the technical education of new workers is strengthened to improve production operations and ensure safe production. Quality inspection procedures and the system for the use, storage, and recycling of raw materials have now been improved.

Currently, the company's employees are checking the implementation of plans and measures in the first half of the year, discussing the production tasks for the third quarter, and many employees are formulating competition plans to greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day and overfulfill the tasks for the third quarter. A great battle to seize iron and steel is booming.

    集中优势力量突击生产关键
    石钢夺铁夺钢更大战斗展开
    本报讯　石景山钢铁公司对第三季度的钢铁生产已作了安排。在这个决定性的季度里，公司的职工们提出了“把握时机，大干三月，用出色的生产成就迎接国庆十周年”的口号。
    这个公司今年上半年钢铁等主要产品的生产水平比去年同期都有很大增长，例如生产总值增长了38％，生铁增长了20％，钢为去年年产量的两倍。这是一个大跃进。但是，全年仍有三分之二左右的生产任务要在下半年内完成，在具有关键意义的第三季度里，能不能继续大幅度地提高生产水平，就成为保证完成全年任务的一个突出问题。
    经过认真的讨论和计算，根据客观可能性，这个公司提出第三季度钢的生产水平要比上一季度提高14％，生铁的生产水平比上一季度提高15％。实现这个计划，就能为完成全年任务打下一个可靠的基础。
    为了迅速提高钢铁的生产水平，这个公司确定集中优势力量突击完成有关的各项重大措施，例如提高生铁产量的关键问题之一是焦炭供应不足，这个公司决定集中力量迅速兴建红旗三号焦炉和完成三焦炉的有关工程，以增产焦炭。
    要求提高生产水平，必然带来运输量的加大，对设备的保养也提出了更高的要求，为了使厂内运输畅通无阻，这个公司的领导亲自组织力量深入调查研究，决定采取扩大定点范围，提高机车车辆和机械设备的利用效率，密切生产部门和运输部门之间的协作等措施，使运输工作跟上生产发展的需要。
    这个公司还决定第三季度继续健全和贯彻执行各种规章制度。例如针对第三季度气候炎热和雷雨多的情况，组织职工学习技术操作规程和安全规程，加强新工人的技术教育，以改善生产操作，保证安全生产。质量检验规程和原材料的使用、保管、回收制度，现在也已健全起来。
    现在，这个公司的职工，正在检查上半年计划和措施的执行情况，讨论第三季度的生产任务，很多职工正在纷纷制订迎接国庆十周年，超额完成第三季度任务的竞赛计划。一场夺铁夺钢的大战正在蓬勃展开。
