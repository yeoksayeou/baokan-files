    Important Action by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

    On July 7th, Phạm Văn Đồng, Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, regarding the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam and Laos over the past five years. Attached was a memorandum on the South Vietnamese authorities' continuous sabotage of the Geneva Accords and intensified war preparations under the direction of the United States. In these documents, Foreign Minister Phạm Văn Đồng once again detailed the true situation in Vietnam and Laos and earnestly requested the two chairmen to study the situation and take active measures to ensure the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords. This is another important action by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to promote the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and uphold the Geneva Accords.

    It has been exactly five years since the restoration of peace in Indochina. However, the peaceful reunification of North and South Vietnam has not yet been realized according to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, which is a highly abnormal situation. This unfortunate situation is entirely caused by the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities. For five years, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently worked to implement the Geneva Accords, not only actively suggesting that the North and South hold negotiations on the issue of reunification, but also repeatedly suggesting discussions on mutual disarmament, trade, and allowing cultural, scientific, women's, and children's groups to visit relatives and friends, and free communication. However, the Ngô Đình Diệm clique in South Vietnam, incited by the United States, brazenly disregarded the earnest wishes of the Vietnamese people and unreasonably rejected this series of reasonable proposals by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, thus causing the Vietnamese people to suffer the pain of national division and family separation for a long time.

    Foreign Minister Phạm Văn Đồng's letter strongly exposes the South Vietnamese Ngô Đình Diệm clique's sabotage of the Geneva Accords. The South Vietnamese authorities have allowed the United States to bring in more than two thousand new military advisors and personnel. As of March 1958, a total of 380 ship voyages had brought approximately 100,000 tons of American weapons and war materials into South Vietnam; they have also allowed the United States to build airfields, naval bases, and strategic highways in South Vietnam for use by American jet aircraft and strategic air forces. At the same time, the South Vietnamese authorities have carried out bloody persecution of former resistance personnel and patriotic people in South Vietnam. According to incomplete statistics, as of February 1959, more than 180,000 people had been arrested, over 10,000 injured or disabled, and nearly 5,000 had died or gone missing. Particularly infuriating is the Ngô Đình Diệm clique's inhuman massacre of patriots imprisoned in concentration camps. For example, in December 1958, South Vietnamese secret agents poisoned six thousand patriots in the Phú Lợi concentration camp. All of this cannot be denied by the Ngô Đình Diệm clique. The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam has listed some facts related to this in its various reports. The Vietnam International Commission, in its most recent, the ninth, interim report, mentioned the Phú Lợi concentration camp massacre, the illegal entry of American military personnel, and the so-called "Temporary Equipment Replacement Team" stationed in South Vietnam by the United States. However, the South Vietnamese authorities have never responded to these issues, let alone taken any action. The normal activities of the International Commission have also been obstructed in every possible way in South Vietnam, to the point where it cannot effectively function. As Foreign Minister Phạm Văn Đồng correctly pointed out in his letter, all the facts show that the United States and the Ngô Đình Diệm clique attempt to permanently divide Vietnam, intensify war preparations, cruelly suppress the patriotic and progressive forces in South Vietnam, and turn South Vietnam into an aggressive springboard in the US imperialists' plan to re-ignite war in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    For five years, US imperialism, using the Ngô Đình Diệm clique as a tool, has controlled South Vietnam politically, economically, and militarily, gradually turning South Vietnam into its military base and colony, and further extending its aggressive claws to Laos and Cambodia, threatening the peace and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This is the strategic deployment of US imperialism to invade the entire Indochina. US President Eisenhower, in his Gettysburg address in April this year, particularly emphasized the "strategic" importance of South Vietnam, which fully exposes the United States' true intentions towards South Vietnam. US imperialism is precisely using the South Vietnamese Ngô Đình Diệm clique to constantly interfere in the situation in Laos and carry out subversive conspiracies against the Kingdom of Cambodia. In order to fully incorporate South Vietnam and Laos into the US war plan for aggression in the Far East, US imperialism is doing everything possible to link them with the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. Recently, US imperialism has been intensifying its efforts to piece together a military alliance between South Vietnam, Laos, and individual member countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. At the same time, it has been noted that US imperialism also intends to transport atomic and rocket weapons into South Vietnam. These conspiratorial activities by the United States have exacerbated the tense situation in Indochina and endanger the peace of Southeast Asia. Therefore, the US interference and aggression in Indochina and the Ngô Đình Diệm clique's actions in violation and destruction of the Geneva Accords must be stopped quickly in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and ensure the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords in Indochina.

    The letter from Foreign Minister Phạm Văn Đồng of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference expresses the legitimate desire of the Vietnamese people to thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords and achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. We believe that this solemn demand of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will attract the attention of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the participating countries of the Geneva Conference, and that all relevant parties should take active actions to change the increasingly worrying situation. As a participating country of the Geneva Conference and a loyal friend of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people firmly support the Vietnamese people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. We firmly support the significant efforts made by the Vietnamese people to safeguard the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords in Indochina.

### 越南民主共和国的重要行动

    越南民主共和国的重要行动
    越南民主共和国外交部长范文同在7月7日就日内瓦协议五年来在越南和老挝的履行情况，写信给日内瓦会议的两位主席苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德，随信附有关于南越当局在美国指使下不断破坏日内瓦协议和加紧备战活动的备忘录。范文同外长在这些文件中再一次详细地陈述了当前越南和老挝的真实情况，并且恳切地要求两主席研究那里的局势，采取积极的措施，以保证日内瓦协议的彻底履行。这是越南民主共和国促进越南的和平统一和维护日内瓦协议的又一重要行动。
    印度支那和平恢复已经整整五个年头了。但是越南北南地区迄今仍未根据日内瓦协议的规定实现和平统一，这应该说是极不正常的局势。这种不幸的局势，完全是美国和南越当局所造成的。五年来，越南民主共和国一贯为实施日内瓦协议而努力，不仅积极建议北、南双方就统一问题举行谈判，而且还一再建议商讨双方共同裁军、互通贸易，以及允许文化科学等团体和妇女儿童来往参观探亲、自由通信等问题。但是，南越吴庭艳集团在美国的唆使下悍然不顾越南人民的殷切愿望，无理地拒绝了越南民主共和国政府的这一系列合理的建议，因而使得越南人民长期遭受着祖国分裂和亲属隔离的痛苦。
    范文同外长的信件对南越吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议作了有力的揭露。南越当局允许美国先后运入了二千多名新的军事顾问和人员，截至1958年3月，共有轮船三百八十艘次把约十万吨美国武器和战争物资运入南越；还允许美国在南越修建供美国喷气式飞机和战略空军使用的飞机场、海军基地及战略公路。同时，南越当局对南越前抗战人员及爱国人民进行了血腥迫害。据不完全统计，截至1959年2月，共有十八万多人被逮捕，一万余人受伤或残废，近五千人死亡或失踪。尤其令人愤慨的是，吴庭艳集团惨无人道地残杀集中营里被囚的爱国者，如1958年12月发生了南越特务用毒药谋害富利集中营六千名爱国者的惨案。所有这一切都是吴庭艳集团所不能抵赖的。越南国际监察和监督委员会在历次报告中都曾列举了有关这方面的部分事实。越南国际委员会在最近一次，即第九次的临时报告中就谈到了富利集中营惨案、美国军事人员的非法入境，以及美国驻在南越的所谓“临时装备更新团”等问题。可是南越当局对这些问题从来都没有答复，更谈不上作出任何处理。国际委员会的正常活动在南越也受到百般阻挠，以至根本不能有效地进行。正如范文同外长的信里正确地指出，一切事实都说明了美国和吴庭艳集团企图长期分割越南，加紧备战，残酷地镇压南越的爱国进步力量，把南越变成美帝国主义准备在印度支那和东南亚重新挑起战争的计划中的一个侵略跳板。
    五年来，美帝国主义，以吴庭艳集团为工具，从政治、经济和军事各方面控制了南越，逐步地把南越变成它的军事基地和殖民地，并且进一步把侵略魔手伸向老挝和柬埔寨，威胁越南民主共和国的和平与安全。这是美帝国主义侵略整个印度支那的战略部署。美国总统艾森豪威尔在今年4月间葛底斯堡的演说中特别强调南越在“战略上”的重要性，这充分暴露了美国对南越的真实意图。美帝国主义正是利用了南越吴庭艳集团不断地干涉着老挝的局势，并对柬埔寨王国进行了颠复阴谋。为了把南越和老挝完全纳入美国侵略远东的战争计划，美帝国主义千方百计地使它们与东南亚侵略集团联系起来。最近时期，美帝国主义正在加紧策划拼凑南越、老挝和东南亚条约组织个别成员国的军事联盟。同时人们已经注意到，美帝国主义还企图把原子和火箭武器运入南越。美国的这些阴谋活动加剧了印度支那的紧张局势，危害着东南亚的和平。因此，必须迅速制止美国对印度支那的干涉和侵略，制止吴庭艳集团违反和破坏日内瓦协议的行为，以实现越南的和平统一和保证日内瓦协议在印度支那的贯彻执行。
    越南民主共和国范文同外长致日内瓦会议两主席的信件表达了越南人民要求彻底实施日内瓦协议和实现越南和平统一的正当愿望。我们相信，越南民主共和国政府的这一严正要求，必将引起日内瓦会议两主席和日内瓦会议的参加国的重视，并且认为有关各方面都应当采取积极的行动来改变目前日益令人不安的状况。作为日内瓦会议的参加国和越南人民的忠实朋友，中国人民坚决支持越南人民为争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争。坚决支持越南人民为维护日内瓦协议在印度支那的彻底实施而作的重大努力。
