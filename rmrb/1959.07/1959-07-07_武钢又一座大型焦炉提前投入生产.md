Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 6th. On July 5th at 11 PM, another 65-hole large coke oven – Coke Oven No. 3 – at Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) discharged coke. This coke oven is an important project to supply coke needed for WISCO's No. 2 blast furnace. Its early commissioning is a prelude to the upcoming iron production of No. 2 blast furnace.

The construction of Coke Oven No. 3 has been consistently carried out in accordance with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results. From civil engineering, bricklaying, machine installation to oven baking, construction workers not only created many new records in construction speed, but also achieved good results in ensuring project quality, reducing costs, and improving labor productivity. Bricklaying workers completed the bricklaying task of ninety days in thirty-five working days. Machine installation workers used only seven days to install the three major components that were previously considered the most difficult to install: the furnace door frame, protective plate, and furnace body support. In the construction process, the workers put ensuring project quality in the first place, and universally established a four-level inspection system of individual inspection, mutual aid group inspection, large group inspection, and workshop inspection. Each group conducted quality appraisals. After evaluation, the quality of this coke oven is even better than Coke Ovens No. 1 and No. 2. On the basis of ensuring project quality, the workers also reduced costs. In the bricklaying alone, more than 640,000 yuan was saved for the country, including 938 tons of refractory bricks. Labor productivity also increased by 41%.

    武钢又一座大型焦炉提前投入生产
    新华社武汉6日电　7月5日晚上十一时，武钢又一座六十五孔的大型焦炉——三号焦炉出焦了。这座焦炉是供给武钢二号高炉所需焦炭的一项重要工程。它的提早投入生产，是二号高炉即将出铁的前奏。
    三号焦炉的建设是一直根据多快好省的原则进行的，从土建、砌砖、机器安装到烘炉，建设工人们不仅在施工速度上创造了许多新纪录，而且在保证工程质量、降低成本、提高劳动生产率等方面都取得了良好的成绩。筑炉工人用三十五个工作日完成了九十天的砌砖任务。机装工人只用七天的时间，安装好过去认为最难安装的炉门框子、保护板、炉体支柱等三大件。在施工中，工人们都把确保工程质量提到首要地位，普遍建立了个人检查、互助组检查、大组检查、工段检查的四级检查制度，每个小组都进行质量评比。经过评定，这座焦炉的质量比一、二号焦炉还好。工人们在确保工程质量的基础上，也降低了成本，仅是砌砖一项，就为国家节约了六十四万多元，其中节约耐火砖九百三十八吨。劳动生产率也提高了41％。
