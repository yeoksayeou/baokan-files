    How to Uphold the Party Committee's Collective Leadership and Division of Labor Responsibility System
    CPC Hebei Xianxian Wu Gong People's Commune Committee

    In our work practice, we deeply realize that the Party committee's collective leadership and division of labor responsibility system are unshakable at any time and under any circumstances. Only by relying on the collective political experience and the collective wisdom based on the Party's guidelines and policies can we ensure the Party's correct leadership over the people's commune and the victorious advancement of the commune's various construction undertakings along the broad road.

    So, how can we realize the principle of the Party's collective leadership and division of labor responsibility system? Here are some of our experiences.

      Improve the Party Committee Meeting System,
  So that Every Member Can Speak Freely

    Establishing and improving the Party committee meeting system is the primary link in realizing the collective leadership of the commune Party committee. Since the establishment of the people's commune, we have stipulated and implemented a meeting system of one secretary meeting per week, one standing committee meeting every half month, and one full committee meeting every month. In the initial stage of implementing this system, due to the large scale, complicated work, and lack of leadership experience in this area, coupled with insufficient preparation before the meeting and unclear meeting focus, the result was often that major issues that needed to be resolved were not resolved thoroughly, while issues that did not need to be discussed and resolved at the meeting were entangled endlessly. This not only diluted the central topic of the meeting and prolonged the meeting time, but also resulted in phenomena such as the secretary talking more, the general committee members talking less, and sometimes the issue being discussed but not decided, or decided but not implemented. Over time, this will make the Party committee's collective leadership merely a formality, bringing undue losses to the Party's cause.

    Practice has educated us, making us realize that to realize the Party committee's collective leadership, it is not enough to merely establish a meeting system. The key issue is whether all members of the committee can speak freely, and truly concentrate and persist in everyone's opinions. Faced with this situation, the commune Party committee conducted a special study on this issue. In order to hold good Party committee meetings and truly exert the collective leadership role of the Party committee, in addition to further clarifying the basic tasks of the secretary meeting, the standing committee meeting, and the full committee meeting, we also followed the spirit of "three no's" (no meeting without preparation, no meeting if the people who should and can attend are not all present, no meeting for non-major issues) and focusing on resolving two or three major issues at each meeting. We stipulated the meeting agenda, notified each Party committee member in advance, and required the relevant members in charge of the work of various ministries and commissions to prepare the materials to be submitted to the plenary session for discussion two days before the meeting (including the situation, analysis, and future opinions or solutions), and distribute them to each member to facilitate their understanding of the situation and consideration of opinions. After implementing this, the quality of the meeting was greatly improved, the collective leadership was effectively strengthened, and the development of current work was promoted. At a standing committee meeting held on June 19, due to the clear meeting focus and thorough preparation beforehand, the comrades attending the meeting were able to speak freely and sincerely. Standing Committee member Wang Yukun and other comrades suggested that in order to ensure a bumper grain harvest this year, it is not enough to only pay attention to weeding at present, but also to seize the time to eliminate pests recently. Some committee members also proposed that on the one hand, we should end the summer harvest and strive for clean fields and all grains returning home; on the other hand, we should vigorously carry out the weeding and seedling protection campaign, and at the same time carry out the renovation and reform of agricultural tools to solve the problem of lack of manpower and animal power. After discussion, a consensus was reached, and the Party committee finally decided that from late June to late July, a competition campaign of "four no's," "two goods," "one clean," and "three more's" would be launched ("four no's" means no weeds, no insects, no diseases, no idle land; "two goods" means good summer harvest, summer requisition, and summer purchase, and good distribution of summer grain to households; "three more's" means more pig raising, more fertilizer accumulation, and more livestock breeding). Such a meeting had a clear focus and rich content, preventing the drawbacks of subjectivity and one-sidedness in the decision-making of a few comrades, while giving play to collective wisdom. The meeting time was short and the problem was solved quickly. Therefore, everyone was very satisfied, which further encouraged everyone's enthusiasm, and the vigorous competition campaign immediately launched among the production teams.

      Adapt to Local Conditions and Adopt
  Multiple Methods to Embody the Party's
  Collective Leadership

    Establishing and improving the meeting system is undoubtedly very important for realizing the principle of the Party committee's collective leadership and division of labor responsibility system. But it should also be seen that in the post-commune period, in order to continuously improve the level of leadership, some leading cadres of the Party committee constantly went to other places to attend meetings or visit, and in order to strengthen the work of the production team, a considerable number of Party committee members often lived in the production team. In this case, there would often be some temporary major issues that needed to be studied and decided by the Party committee before they could be implemented. If the committee members working in the team were called back to hold a meeting, it would make them constantly travel between the team and the commune, making it difficult for them to go deep, thus affecting the leadership of the production team. It would also be impossible to hold a meeting after the members who had gone out returned. If the decision were made by the first secretary or other secretaries, it would inevitably form a situation where a few people decided the issue, which is not in line with the Party's principle of collective leadership. What should be done? We used methods such as individual contact and telephone conferences to smoothly resolve the above contradictions and adhere to the Party's principle of collective leadership. For example, when the county Party committee recently held a five-level cadre meeting, only two secretaries and a few members were left at home. At this time, the comrades attending the meeting in the county, through methods such as telephone calls and sending people home in turn, promptly told the comrades at home about the work plan considered during the meeting and their opinions on the current production of the commune. After discussion between the two parties, a resolution was formed. In this way, the phenomenon of emphasizing special circumstances and not being able to implement collective leadership was avoided, the role of collective leadership was fully exerted, and the newly assigned work tasks of the county Party committee were implemented one step ahead of schedule.

    These facts make us deeply realize that whether the Party committee's collective leadership can be realized is not just a matter of working methods, but more importantly, a matter of ideological understanding. Experience has proved that the more arduous the task and the more urgent the time, the more necessary it is to strengthen the Party committee's collective leadership. Only in this way can we ensure the unity of the Party's thinking, the consistency of steps, and better mobilize and lead the masses to complete the work tasks. For example, on June 16, it rained heavily, and it was temporarily impossible to harvest wheat or thresh. According to the situation at the time, the second secretary in the office believed that the opportunity of the land being wet after the rain should be seized to quickly reinforce seedlings throughout the commune. The task was urgent, and if it was not carried out quickly, the land would crack. However, there was not enough time to call back the secretaries and standing committee members who had gone down to the teams to hold a meeting for discussion. In order to ensure collective leadership, the secretaries at home first conducted research, put forward preliminary opinions, and discussed with other secretaries and standing committee members through telephone contact. The secretaries and standing committee members who went down, based on the actual situation of each team, fully expressed their opinions and put forward measures on how to seize this favorable opportunity, ensure quality and quantity, and complete the task of reinforcing seedlings on time. In this way, the measures were more implemented. Taking advantage of the good conditions of the land being wet after the rain, each team launched a shock reinforcement seedling campaign, reinforcing more than 3,200 mu of seedlings, and basically eliminating the phenomenon of missing seedlings.

      Divide Battle Lines, Major Issues
  Decided by the Party Committee, Specific Affairs
  Under the Responsibility of Committee Members

    It is not enough to have only these. While adhering to the Party committee's collective leadership, it is also necessary to implement the individual division of labor responsibility system, and the two must be organically combined regularly. Of course, division of labor responsibility does not mean that individuals decide major issues, but rather the individual division of labor responsibility system under the collective leadership of the Party committee. In order to ensure the realization of this leadership principle, we divided all Party committee members into four battle lines, with one secretary assigned to manage each battle line; the first secretary is responsible for overall work; the secretaries and standing committee members of each battle line, in addition to being responsible for the work of their own battle line, must also be responsible for the agricultural battle line, in order to strengthen the main attack battle line and concentrate forces to do a good job in agricultural production.

    With the division of labor of battle lines, the secretary and committee members of the division of labor must have duties and powers. In this regard, we have adhered to and implemented the individual division of labor responsibility system under the collective leadership of the Party committee. In order to give full play to the role of each Party committee member, we have clarified the scope of authority of each Party committee member and each ministry and commission. Except for stage work and major issues involving the Party's guidelines and policies, and some issues of various battle lines and departments that must be submitted to the Party committee meeting for discussion, they must be submitted to the Party committee meeting for discussion to form a resolution. After the meeting, the members in charge of each division will implement them separately. General daily work is handled by the members in charge, and the Party committee only conducts key supervision and inspection. In this way, both the collective leadership of the Party committee is strengthened, and the individual division of labor responsibility is implemented, giving full play to the active role of each Party committee member. Some comrades who were not proactive enough in their work in the past have also become proactive, and those who were proactive in their work have become even more proactive; the phenomenon of not daring to be boldly responsible in their work has disappeared; and they have changed from looking for the secretary for everything, big and small, to looking for the member in charge. Party Committee Secretary and Minister of Industry Chen Shaozhi, originally due to insufficient clear responsibilities, coupled with a lack of experience in leading industry, even for some daily work that he should have made his own decisions, he had to find the first secretary to study; since it was clarified which work and issues should be submitted to the Party committee for discussion and decision, and which should be decided or resolved by the secretary in charge and the department in charge on their own, the sense of responsibility was further strengthened. He went deep into the workshop, humbly learned from experienced people, and quickly transformed himself from an "outsider" into an "insider," shouldering the heavy burden entrusted to him by the Party committee, and vigorously launched mass movements in his work, making rapid progress in the work on the industrial front. Standing Committee member and Minister of Farmland Water Conservancy Wang Yukun had been very proactive in his work in the past. Since implementing the collective leadership and individual division of labor responsibility system, he has further exerted his subjective initiative. He actively and meticulously arranged the work of his department, stipulating that a department meeting should be held every half month, a plan every seven days, and an inspection every three days. According to the requirement that economic work should be done more and more meticulously, he adopted the method of focusing on key points in everything and creating models for each work item, enriching his leadership experience and powerfully promoting the development of current work. In view of the characteristics that wheat dense planting cannot use large hoes, he first focused on reforming the hoeing tools in the North Security and North Horse production teams. The efficiency of using small iron harrows to rake wheat was one and a half times higher than using small iron hooks. After success, it was immediately promoted throughout the commune.

    With the implementation of the division of labor responsibility system, the secretaries jumped out of the circle of tedious affairs in the past, and were able to have more time to go deep, discover problems, and solve problems in a timely manner; at the same time, they were also able to have ample time to study the Party's guidelines and policies, and consider some major issues of the commune. Some important issues were discovered during the secretaries' in-depth work, and were promptly studied and resolved through Party committee meetings.

    怎样坚持党委集体领导和分工负责制
    中共河北献县五公人民公社委员会
    我们在自己的工作实践中深深体会到，党委的集体领导和分工负责制，在任何时候任何情况下，都是不可动摇的。只有依靠集体的政治经验，只有以党的方针政策为依据的集体智慧，才能保证党对人民公社的正确领导，才能保证公社的各项建设事业沿着康庄大道胜利前进。
    那么，怎样才能实现党的集体领导和分工负责制的原则呢？下面谈谈我们的一些体会。
      健全党委会议制度，
  使每个委员都能畅所欲言
    建立与健全党委会议制度，是实现公社党委集体领导的首要一环。自从建立人民公社以来，我们就规定并执行了每周一次书记会议，半月一次常委会议，一个月召开一次全体委员会议的会议制度。执行这一制度的初期，由于摊子大，工作繁杂，又缺乏这方面的领导经验，再加上会前准备不足，会议中心不明确，结果常常形成要解决的重大问题解决得不彻底，而不需要在会议上讨论解决的问题，却提到会议上纠缠不清。这样一来，不仅冲淡了会议的中心议题，拖长了会议时间，而且出现了书记谈的多，一般委员谈的少，和有时议而不决、决而不行等现象。长此下去，将会使党委的集体领导徒具形式，给党的事业带来不应有的损失。
    实践教育了我们，使我们认识到，要想实现党委的集体领导，仅仅满足于建立了会议制度是不行的。关键问题在于能不能使委员会全体成员畅所欲言，真正把大家的意见集中起来、坚持下去。面对着这一情况，公社党委就这一问题专门进行了研究。为了使党委的会议开好，切实发挥党委的集体领导作用，我们除进一步明确了书记会议、常委会议和全体委员会议的基本任务以外，还本着“三不开”（没准备的会议不开，应当参加又能够参加的人员不齐不开，非重大问题不开）和每次会议重点解决二、三个重大问题的精神，规定了会议议事日程，提前通知各党委委员，并由主管各部委工作的有关委员，在会议前两天把提交全会讨论的材料准备好（要有情况，有分析，有今后意见或解决的办法），发给各委员，使他们便于了解情况和考虑意见。这样执行后，大大提高了会议质量，有效地加强了集体领导，并促进了当前工作的开展。在6月19日举行的一次常委会议上，由于会前明确了会议中心，有了充分的准备，与会同志都能畅所欲言，言而由衷。常委委员王玉昆等同志提出，为了确保今年粮食大丰收，目前只注意除草是不够的，还要在最近抓紧消灭虫害。有的委员还提出，一方面要结束夏收，争取场光地净，颗粒还家；一方面还要大力开展除草保苗运动，同时还要进行修整和改革农具，解决人力和畜力缺乏的问题。经过讨论，取得了一致意见，党委最后确定：从6月下旬到7月下旬，开展一个“四无”、“两好”、“一光”、“三多”的竞赛运动（“四无”即无草、无虫、无病、无闲散地；“两好”即夏收夏征夏购好，夏粮分配到户好；“三多”是养猪多、积肥多、牲畜繁殖多）。这样的会议，中心明确，内容丰富，防止了少数同志决定问题易于主观片面的弊病，同时发挥了集体的智慧，会议时间短，解决问题快。因此，大家都很满意，进一步鼓舞了大家的积极性，轰轰烈烈的竞赛运动马上就在各生产队之间开展起来了。
      因时因地制宜，采取
  多种办法，体现党的集体
  领导
    建立与健全会议制度，对于实现党委的集体领导和分工负责制的原则，无疑是十分重要的。但是也还应该看到另外一种情况，那就是：在公社化以后，为了不断提高领导水平，党委的一些领导干部不断地去外地开会或参观，为了加强生产队的工作，有相当数量的党委委员经常住生产队。在这种情况下，又往往会有一些临时性的重大问题需要由党委来研究决定后才能贯彻执行。如果把到队工作的委员召集上来开会，就会使他们经常不断地奔波于队社之间，不易深入下去，以致影响到对生产队的领导，等外出的委员回来再开会也是不可能的，如果由第一书记或其他书记来作决定吧，这势必形成少数人决定问题，不符合党的集体领导原则。怎么办呢？我们采用个别联系、电话会议等方法，顺利地解决了上述矛盾，坚持了党的集体领导原则。如最近县委召开五级干部会时，家里只剩下两个书记和少数委员了。这时，在县开会的同志便通过电话和派人轮番回家等办法，将在会议当中考虑的工作方案及对本社当前生产的意见，及时告诉给在家的同志，经过双方讨论而后形成决议。这样，就避免了强调情况特殊不能实行集体领导的现象，充分发挥了集体领导的作用，同时也把县委新布置的工作任务提前执行了一步。
    这些事实使我们深深体会到，能不能实现党委的集体领导，不仅仅是个工作方法问题，更重要的是思想认识问题。经验证明，工作任务越艰巨，时间越紧迫，就更需要加强党委的集体领导。只有这样，才能保证党的思想统一，步调一致，更好地动员和领导群众完成工作任务。例如，6月16日，下了大雨，暂时不能收麦子，也不能打场，在机关的第二书记根据当时的情况，认为应当在全社火速抓紧雨后地湿的机会，突击补苗。任务紧迫，如不抓紧进行，地就要干裂。但是，时间不允许把下队的书记和常委叫回来开会研究。为了保证集体领导，在家里的书记首先作了研究，提出初步意见，通过电话联系的办法，和其他书记、常委进行了讨论。下去的书记、常委根据各队的实际情况，充分发表了意见，提出如何抓紧这一有利时机，保质保量按时完成补苗的措施。这样，使措施更加落实。各队乘雨后地湿的良好条件，开展了突击补苗运动，补苗三千二百多亩，全社基本上消灭了缺苗断垅的现象。
      划分战线，重大问题
  党委决定，具体事务委员
  分工负责
    仅仅有了这些还不够，在坚持党委的集体领导的同时，还必须实行个人分工负责制，要把两者经常有机地结合起来。当然，分工负责决不意味着个人决定重大问题，而是在党委集体领导下的个人分工负责制。为了确保这一领导原则的实现，我们将全体党委委员分为四条战线，每条战线有一个书记分工管理；第一书记负责全面工作；各战线的书记和常委除负责本战线的工作外，并都要对农业战线负责，以便加强主攻战线，集中力量搞好农业生产。
    有了战线分工，就要使分工的书记和委员有职有权。在这方面，我们坚持并执行了党委集体领导下的个人分工负责制。为了充分发挥各党委委员的作用，我们明确了各党委委员以及各部委的职权范围，除去阶段性的工作和涉及到党的方针政策等重大问题，以及各战线、各部门的一些必须提交党委会议讨论的问题，要提交党委会议讨论形成决议。闭会以后由各分工委员分头贯彻执行。一般日常工作即由各主管委员负责处理，党委只是进行重点督促检查。这样作，既加强了党委的集体领导，又实行了个人分工负责，充分发挥了各个党委委员的积极作用。有的过去工作不够主动的同志也主动起来，工作主动的更加主动了；工作中不敢大胆负责的现象没有了；由过去大小事情都找书记，变成找主管委员了。党委书记兼工业部部长陈绍治，原来由于职责不够明确，加上缺乏领导工业的经验，因而遇到应该自己拿主张的一些日常工作，也要找第一书记研究；自从明确了哪些工作和问题应该提交党委会讨论决定，哪些应该由主管书记和主管部门自行决定或解决以后，进一步加强了责任感。他深入车间，虚心向有经验的人学习，使自己很快由“外行”变成了“内行”，肩负起党委交予自己的重担，在工作中大搞群众运动，使工业战线上的工作进展很快。常委委员、农田水利部部长王玉昆，过去工作就很主动，自从贯彻集体领导与个人分工负责制以后，进一步发挥了主观能动作用。他主动细致地安排本部门的工作，规定每半月开一次部务会，七天一计划，三天一检查，并根据经济工作越做越细致的要求，采取了事事抓重点，项项工作搞样板的方法，丰富了领导经验，有力地推动了当前工作的开展。针对小麦密植不能用大锄的特点，他事先在北保、北马两个生产队搞了改革锄地工具的重点，试用小铁耙耙麦比用小铁勾的效率提高一倍半，成功后便立即在全社推广。
    随着分工负责制的推行，书记们从过去的繁琐事务圈子里跳了出来，能够有更多的时间深入下去，发现问题和及时解决问题；同时，也能够有充裕的时间来研究党的方针政策，和考虑本社的一些重大问题。有些重要问题，都是在书记深入工作当中发现，并及时通过党委会议研究和解决的。
