	On Scrutinizing Several Titles
	Recently, while reading the newspaper, I felt that some titles were worth scrutinizing in terms of grammar and rhetoric. For example, a brief news item on page 4 of the People's Daily on June 11th was titled "Burmese Army Kills a Band of Chiang Gang Remnant Troops." "Troops" cannot be killed; it would be more appropriate to change it to killing a certain number of people. The title on page 6 on June 13th, "People's Teacher is a Glorious Post," saying "Teacher" is a "Post" is not appropriate; it would be better to change it to "Educational Work is a Glorious Post." The subtitle of the news on the front page on June 21st, "Great Harvest Comes from Great Potential Tapping," was "Liberating Women's Household Labor Greatly Enhances Field Labor Force." "Liberating Women's Household Labor" is also ungrammatical; the verb "liberate" and the object "labor" do not match properly.　Liu Wanjia

    对几个标题的推敲
    最近读报，觉得有些标题在语法和修辞上还是值得推敲的。例如人民日报6月11日第四版有一则简讯的标题是“缅军击毙一股蒋帮残余部队”，“部队”是不能被击毙的，改为击毙多少人比较妥当。6月13日第六版有一个标题是“人民教师是光荣的岗位”，说“教师”是“岗位”不够恰当，不如改为“教育工作是光荣的岗位”。6月21日第一版“大丰收来自大挖潜力”这条消息的副题是“解放妇女家务劳动使田间劳动力大为增强”，“解放妇女家务劳动”也是不合语法的，动词“解放”和宾语“劳动”配搭不当。　刘万嘉
