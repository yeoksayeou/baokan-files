Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th: Shanxi Province held a province-wide exchange conference for daily necessities and local specialties from June 21st to 30th. The delegations from various regions, composed of representatives from industry, agriculture, commerce, and health departments, signed 3,600 commodity production and sales contracts and agreements at the conference, with a total transaction value of over 140 million yuan.

Through this exchange conference, industry, agriculture, and commerce strengthened cooperation, restored some production and sales relationships that had been interrupted in the past, and further cleared commodity circulation channels. The Jin Southeast region is a production area for ironware and small hardware. In the past, it had production and sales relationships with many parts of the province, but these had been interrupted in recent years. During the conference, the region's representatives signed contracts for 4.5 million yuan worth of ironware and small hardware with representatives from various regions, enabling the resumption and expansion of production of scissors, razors, shoe nails, and various earthen nails. During the exchange conference, the representative of Jiexiu County re-arranged production, revising the original plan to supply 600,000 pieces to supplying 4.2 million pieces, and signed production and sales contracts with representatives from Yangquan, Taigu, Fenyang, Datong, Taiyuan, and other places.

During the conference, representatives from various regions actively provided raw materials to support production. Thirteen state-owned and local state-owned paper mills in the province needed raw materials, and representatives from various regions signed contracts with these paper mills to supply more than 50,000 tons of paper-making raw materials such as cotton fiber and grass fiber, which can basically meet the production needs of these factories this year. The Jinnan area has accumulated oil sludge for soap production, but lacks caustic soda; through this exchange, a contract has been signed with the representative of Shanyin County to purchase 200 tons of caustic soda.

Delegations from various regions also adjusted the backlog of commodities cleared from warehouses at the conference, making the distribution of commodities in the market more rational.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 6th: Qinghai Province recently held an exchange meeting for daily necessities and miscellaneous local specialties, expanding the source of small commodities, providing raw materials for industry and handicraft industry, and opening up avenues for diversified operations for communes.

Through this exchange meeting, representatives from various regions discovered that many small commodities could be manufactured in the province and that raw materials were abundant. For example, there is *Calamagrostis epigejos* and *Iris Lactea* everywhere in the province, which can be used to make brooms and pot brushes. Other items such as carrying baskets, back buckets, chopsticks, and shovel handles can all be manufactured in the province. The Heerchuan Commune of the Mutual Aid Tu Autonomous County organized its members to process a large number of brooms from *Calamagrostis epigejos*, *Iris Lactea*, and nettles in a few days. A total of more than 127,000 brooms were purchased at this conference. During the nine days of the exchange meeting, representatives from various regions in the province signed purchase and sales contracts and agreements for more than 2,600 kinds of commodities, of which the value of local specialties and handicraft products alone was more than 3.9 million yuan.

    山西青海大买大卖土特产品
    据新华社太原6日电　山西省从6月21日到30日举行了全省日用杂品和土特产品的交流大会。各地由工业、农业、商业和卫生部门组成的代表团，在大会上签订了三千六百份商品产销合同和协议，成交总值达一亿四千多万元。
    通过这次交流大会，工、农、商三方面加强了协作，恢复了过去一度中断的一些产销关系，进一步疏通了商品流通渠道。晋东南地区是铁货和小五金商品的产地，过去与全省不少地方有产销关系，但是近几年已经中断。大会期间，这个地区的代表与各地代表签订了成交四百五十万元铁货和小五金商品的合同，使剪刀、剃头刀、鞋钉和各种土钉等的生产都恢复和扩大了。介休县代表在交流大会期间，重新安排了生产，把原来供应六十万件的计划修改为供应四百二十万件，并且与阳泉、太谷、汾阳、大同、太原等地的代表签订了产销合同。
    在大会期间，各地代表纷纷互相提供原料材料，支援生产。全省十三个国营、地方国营造纸厂需要原料，各地代表便纷纷与这些造纸厂签订合同，共供应棉纤维、草纤维等造纸原料五万多吨，基本上可以满足这些工厂今年生产的需要。晋南地区积存着生产肥皂用的油泥，但是缺少火碱；通过这次交流，已和山阴县代表签订了购进二百吨火碱的合同。
    各地代表团还在大会上调剂了从仓库中清理出来的积压商品，使市场上的商品摆布更加合理。
    据新华社西宁6日电　青海省最近召开日用杂品和零星土特产品交流会，扩大了小商品的货源，为工业、手工业提供了原料和材料，为公社开辟了多种经营的门路。
    通过这次交流会，各地代表发现很多小商品本省能够制造，原料也很丰富。如省内到处都有芨芨草、马莲草，可以用来做扫帚、锅刷。其他如抬筐、背斗、筷子、锨把等，都可以由省内制造。互助土族自治县贺尔川公社组织社员在几天内用芨芨草、马莲草、浪麻，加工了大批扫帚，这次大会共收购了十二万七千多把。在交流会召开的九天中，省内各地代表共签订了二千六百多种商品的购销合同和协议，其中仅土特产品和手工业产品，就价值三百九十多万元。（附图片）
    在山西省物资交流会上，展出实物样品一千多种，参加会议的人员选中后，现场就可以成交。
