    Several Views in Soviet Economic Circles on the Issue of Economic Development Speed

    Will the development speed of socialist countries' national economies slow down as the level of production increases? This is the focus of the current debate in Soviet economic circles regarding the issue of national economic development speed. On this issue, there are currently four different viewpoints.

    The first view holds that a larger base will lead to a slower speed, but once industrial development reaches a certain height, the downward trend in speed can be stabilized. For example, Professor Vashugin of the Soviet National Economic Planning Committee said: A larger base will lead to a slower speed. China's current speed is very fast, but in the future, it won't be as fast when the base becomes larger. He also said that in countries where industrial development has reached a certain height, such as the current Soviet Union, the downward trend in speed can be stabilized, and the annual speed will be at the level of 8%-9% in the future. Since the speed in real life has stabilized at the level of 8%-10%, this speed is reasonable (he was referring to the average growth rate from 1956 to 1958 and the Seven-Year Plan).

    The second view holds that there is no inherent theoretical connection between speed and level. For example, Paul, the deputy director of the Long-Term Planning Bureau of the Soviet Planning Committee, and economist Notkin both believe that industrial speed is determined by two factors: first, the products or accumulation invested in industrial reproduction, and second, the capital capacity of unit products (i.e., the investment effect). In addition, the shortening of working hours also has a certain impact on speed. They also believe that after the speed drops to a certain period, that is, the current stage, it will stabilize. Therefore, the current speed is the most appropriate speed.

    The third view holds that as the level of industrial production rises, the speed will decrease to a certain extent, but it is not a downward curve, but a wave-shaped curve. For example, Academician Strumilin said that from a long-term perspective, the change in speed is like a wave-shaped curve, and after a certain period, several peaks will appear. The speed of the Soviet Union has fluctuated several times in the past forty years. In the future, due to the new technological revolution, especially the promotion of automation, new speed peaks may appear. When talking about speed and balance, he said that we need both high speed and proportional development, and at the same time, we must not create excessive tension. To this end, reserves must be established. General disproportions are not important, but those disproportions that cause tension in class relations must be prevented from occurring.

    The fourth view holds that it cannot be said that the speed decreases with the increase in level is an objective trend. They say that the speed in the future does not necessarily decrease. For example, Kozlov said that from the essence of the socialist economic system, the industrial development speed must not be lower than the population growth speed. If we only consider the factor of the growth of labor volume, the speed in the future may still decrease, but it will not be lower than the population growth speed. If we look at the labor productivity factor, the development speed in the future may not decrease, because the growth of labor productivity depends on the development of science and technology and the improvement of production management methods, which have no limits. Since the development speed in the future is mainly determined by the growth of labor productivity, the "theory of diminishing speed" naturally cannot be established.

### 苏联经济学界关于经济发展速度问题的几种看法

    苏联经济学界关于经济发展速度问题的几种看法
    社会主义国家国民经济，随着生产水平的提高，发展速度是否会降低？这是苏联经济学界目前关于国民经济发展速度问题的争论焦点。在这个问题上，目前存在四种不同的看法。
    第一种意见认为，基数大了速度会降低，但工业发展到一定高度，速度下降的趋势可以稳定下来。例如苏联国民经济计划委员会瓦秀金教授说：基数大了速度会降低，中国现在的速度很快，但以后基数大了就不能这么快。又说，工业发展到一定高度的国家，如现在的苏联，速度下降的趋势又可以稳定下来，今后一段时期年速度将在8％—9％的水平上。既然现实生活中速度已稳定在8％—10％的水平上，那末这一速度就是合理的（他指的是1956到1958年和七年计划的平均增长速度）。
    第二种意见认为，速度同水平在理论上没有必然的联系，例如苏联计委长期计划局副局长保尔和经济学家诺特金都认为，工业速度决定于两种原因，一是投入工业再生产的产品或积累，一是单位产品的资金容量（即投资效果）。此外，劳动时间的缩短，对速度也有一定的影响。他们并认为，速度下降到一定时期，即目前阶段，就会稳定下来。所以目前的速度是最恰当的速度。
    第三种意见认为，随着工业生产水平的上升，速度将有一定的下降，但不是一个下降曲线，而是波浪形曲线。例如斯特鲁米林院士说，从长期来看，速度的变化像一波状曲线，经过一定时期，会出现几个波峰。苏联四十年来速度波动了几次。今后由于新的技术革命，特别是自动化的推广，可能出现新的速度波峰。谈到速度和平衡时，他说，我们既要高速度也要保持成比例的发展，同时不要造成过分紧张。为此，就必须设立后备。一般的比例失调并不要紧，但是那些引起阶级关系紧张的比例失调，则必须防止它们发生。
    第四种意见认为，不能说速度随水平的上升而下降是客观趋势。他们说，今后的速度并不一定下降。例如，科兹洛夫说，从社会主义经济制度本质来看，工业发展速度决不能低于人口增长速度。如果单从劳动量增长的因素来看，今后的速度还有降低的可能，但也不会低于人口增长的速度。如果从劳动生产率因素来看，今后的发展速度就不一定会下降，因为劳动生产率的增长，取决于科学技术的发展和生产管理方式的改善，这是没有什么界限的。今后的发展速度既然主要由劳动生产率增长的情况来决定，“速度递减论”自然不能成立。
