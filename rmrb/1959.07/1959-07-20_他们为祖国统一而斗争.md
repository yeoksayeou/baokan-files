    They Fight for National Reunification
    Zhou Gangming
    On October 10, 1956, I was deeply moved in a cinema in Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, when I saw a Polish newsreel entitled "Letters from Vietnam." The filmmaker used a very enthusiastic, keen, and fair perspective to capture the things he wanted to report to the audience. The screen not only fully displayed the rich and beautiful, vivid, and magnificent images of Vietnam's mountains, rivers, people, and products, but also truly reflected the fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people under the leadership of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnam Labor Party, fully demonstrating their diligence, bravery, perseverance, and simplicity. It also profoundly exposed the fact that in the South Vietnam region, the gendarmes and mercenaries of American and French imperialism, and Ngo Dinh Diem's secret agents and police, with ferocious faces and murderous auras, were threatening the people of South Vietnam with pistols and batons, making them live a miserable and painful life under this dark and cruel rule. The film fully contrasted and told us that these were two completely different worlds.
    The film also reflected the Vietnamese people's unparalleled love for their own soldiers - the Vietnamese People's Army. It also exposed the ugly and embarrassing state of the imperialist colonialists after being severely defeated by the Vietnamese people, being forced to retreat. However, when I saw the film showing: the Geneva peace talks decided to draw a line in central Vietnam - the 17th parallel - dividing the entire Vietnam into North and South Vietnam. North Vietnam was under the control of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and South Vietnam was still occupied by American and French imperialism and ruled by his lackey Ngo Dinh Diem. All the people's resistance forces and cadres south of the 17th parallel were concentrated in North Vietnam, asking them to leave their homes where they fought, leave their parents, wives, brothers, sisters, and all relatives. When their relatives saw them off on the road to North Vietnam, the scene of their reluctant farewells, my heart was extremely sad, making me shed the most painful tears together with those who were parting.
    This is the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in order to realize the Indochina armistice agreement, to strive for peace and greater victory, and to gradually realize the reunification of the motherland, they resolutely concentrated their combat forces in the north, and painfully temporarily left the land of the south. What a solemn and great act this is!
    The Vietnamese customs and practices reflected in the film are consistent with the impressions we gained during our nearly two-month visit to North Vietnam. I once summarized my impressions of visiting Vietnam as: fertile land, beautiful mountains and rivers; diligent and thrifty people, popular culture; wise leadership, heroic soldiers; handsome men and beautiful women, rich emotions; hot climate, abundant resources;... making us sincerely love this beautiful country. However, such a beautiful country has not yet been unified, and more than ten million Vietnamese people are still groaning in pain under reactionary rule. Therefore, we deeply hate the unreasonable occupation of American imperialism and the dark rule of his lackey Ngo Dinh Diem. We are deeply moved by the Vietnamese people's movement to strive for national reunification and feel infinite sympathy.
    We visited many places in North Vietnam. Whether we went to the countryside, factories, troops, or schools, we saw the Vietnamese people everywhere working to defend peace, to intensify the socialist production and construction, and to achieve greater achievements to consolidate North Vietnam, and to strive for the reunification of the motherland. Everyone encourages themselves to fight for the reunification of the motherland, and asks themselves what work have they done for the reunification of the motherland? This movement has become an active struggle and action for the masses and cadres. It is closely linked with the daily life and work of the masses, and has become the central goal and guiding ideology for promoting the people to move forward.
    By the beautiful Hoan Kiem Lake in the center of Hanoi, there is a club for cadres from South Vietnam. Every weekend evening, cadres from South Vietnam who are gathered and dispersed in various agencies, troops, factories, and enterprises come here to gather and talk. They exchange news and struggle situations about their hometowns in the south, and report on what work they have done to consolidate North Vietnam and strive for national reunification. This club has become a center for uniting and promoting South Vietnamese cadres to respond to the call of the Party and strive for national reunification.
    We also visited the Hanoi South Vietnam Children's Home, which is full of children of cadres from South Vietnam. These more than a thousand innocent, lively, clever, and beautiful children live a comfortable and happy life of learning and entertainment under the deep care of the government and the careful care of teachers and nannies. When they saw us visiting, they jumped, laughed, and enthusiastically shook our hands, and surrounded us tightly. They told us kindly: "Chinese uncles, our fathers and mothers are staying in the south, doing revolutionary work, and striving for national reunification. We are good, listening to Uncle Ho's words, studying hard, and striving for national reunification. When the motherland is reunified, we will see our fathers and mothers. Chinese uncles, when we grow up, we will build the motherland!..." The children's enthusiastic wishes so powerfully touched my heart, and I blessed that their wishes could be realized.
    The struggle movement of the Vietnamese people for national reunification that I saw is only a part of North Vietnam. There are also the people in South Vietnam, whose movement to strive for national reunification is being massacred under the machine guns, bayonets, and whips of American imperialism and the reactionary Ngo Dinh Diem, being murdered in concentration camps, shedding blood, and paying with their lives to pave the way for the realization of national reunification! I met Nu Pu, a nationally known ethnic hero of the Ba Na ethnic group in Vietnam (the main character in the Vietnamese novel "The Motherland Stands Up." This book has been translated and published by the People's Literature Publishing House), in Hanoi. He is from Gonghua Village, An Khe District, Kon Tum Province, South Vietnam. From the age of fifteen, he resisted French imperialism, using primitive weapons - stones, machetes, axes, and later using landmines to annihilate the enemy. At that time (1956), he was already forty-two years old. He calculated that by the time peace was achieved in 1955, he had personally annihilated one hundred and ninety-five enemies. The imperialists used planes, artillery, and thousands of troops to repeatedly sweep his mountain village dozens of times, and after more than twenty years of stalemate, the imperialists were never able to destroy this tenacious and unyielding mountain village. He told us that in order to study military affairs and to build a strong people's army for the motherland, he left the south. He said that his hometown and his mother were still constantly fighting against persecution and sweeps with American imperialism and the reactionary Ngo Dinh Diem. He wanted to return to the south, and he was full of confidence to fight for the realization of national reunification. He also believed that the victory of the struggle must belong to the Vietnamese people. I believe his words, I believe in the heroic Vietnamese people, I believe in the heroes of the Vietnamese people, they will definitely be able to achieve victory for the realization of Vietnam's reunification. People all over the world who love peace and uphold justice will definitely rise up to actively support the Vietnamese people's struggle to realize Vietnam's reunification! (Attached picture)

    他们为祖国统一而斗争
    周钢鸣
    1956年10月10日，我在越南民主共和国首都河内的一个电影院，看到一部波兰的新闻纪录影片“从越南寄来的信”，使我深深地感动。摄制者以非常热情、敏锐、公正的眼光，来摄取他所要报道给观众知道的事物；画面上，既充分显示出越南山川、人物、物产的丰富美好、鲜明壮丽的生动形象，而又真实地反映出，在越南民主共和国政府和越南劳动党的领导下，越南人民充分表现出勤劳勇敢刻苦朴实的战斗精神；深刻地揭露出南越地区，在美、法帝国主义的宪兵、雇佣兵，和吴庭艳的特务、警察，面目狰狞杀气腾腾地拿着手枪警棍，在威胁南越人民，使他们在这黑暗残酷的统治下，过着悲惨痛苦的生活。影片充分对比地告诉我们，这是迥然不同的两个世界。
    影片还反映出越南人民对自己的子弟兵——越南人民军的无比热爱。也暴露了帝国主义殖民者，被越南人民痛击失败之后，被迫得不能不撤退的那副狼狈丑态。可是，当我看到影片映出：经日内瓦和平谈判决定，在越南中部——纬线十七度线，划下一道界线，把整个越南划为北越、南越两界，北越由越南民主共和国管领，南越还由美、法帝国主义侵占和他的走狗吴庭艳统治，而所有在十七度线以南的人民抗战部队和干部，都向北越集结，要他们离开自己战斗的家乡，离开自己的父母、妻子、兄妹以及一切亲人，和他们的亲人，送他们北去集结上路、难舍难分的情景时，我的心里难过极了，使我和那离别的人们，一同流下最伤心的热泪。
    这是越南民主共和国政府和人民，为了实现印度支那停战协定，为了争取和平和更大的胜利，为了能逐步实现祖国的统一，他们毅然把战斗力量集结到北方，忍痛暂时离开南方的土地，这是多么庄严伟大的行为呀！
    影片里所反映的越南风土人情，和我们在北越访问近两个月所得的印象，是一致的。我曾概括我访问越南所得到的印象，是：土地肥沃，山川美丽；人民勤俭，文化普及；领导贤明，战士英勇；男女俊秀，感情丰富；气候炎热，物资富饶；……使我们衷心地喜爱这个美好的国家。可是，这样一个美好的国家，还没有得到统一，还有一千多万越南人民在反动统治下痛苦地呻吟，因而，我们对美帝国主义的无理侵占，和他的走狗吴庭艳的黑暗统治，非常憎恨。对越南人民争取祖国统一的运动，受到深切地感动，引起无限地同情。
    我们在北越访问过不少的地方，不论是走到农村、工厂、部队、学校，处处都看到越南人民，都在为着保卫和平，为着加紧进行社会主义生产建设事业，以取得更大的成就，来巩固北越，为争取祖国的统一而努力。每个人都策励自己，去为祖国的统一而斗争，问问自己为祖国的统一做了些什么工作？这个运动，已成为群众和干部的积极斗争和行动。和群众的日常生活和工作，密切地联系起来，成为推动人民前进的中心目标和指导思想。
    在河内市中心的美丽的还剑湖边，就有一所南越干部们的俱乐部，每当周末的晚上，从南越集结来分散在各机关、部队、工厂、企业中的南越干部，都来到这里汇集、谈心，他们互相交换有关南方家乡的消息和斗争情况，互相汇报各人为巩固北越、争取祖国统一做了些什么工作；这个俱乐部，成为团结、推动南越干部，响应党的号召，争取祖国统一的活动中心。
    我们还到河内南越儿童院去访问，那里尽是收容、养育南越干部的儿女。这一千多个天真烂漫聪明美丽的孩子，在政府的深切关怀，和教师、保姆们细心照顾之下，他们过着舒适快乐的学习、文娱生活。他们看见我们来访问，跳着笑着热情握着我们的双手，把我们紧紧地围拢着，他们亲切地告诉我们：“中国伯伯，我们的爸爸妈妈都留在南方，做革命工作，努力争取祖国统一；我们乖，听胡伯伯的话，努力学习，争取祖国统一。祖国统一了，我们就见到爸爸妈妈了。中国伯伯，我们长大了，我们要去建设祖国！……”孩子们的热情愿望，是那么有力地打动了我的心，我为他们的愿望能够实现祝福。
    我所看到的越南人民争取祖国统一的斗争运动，仅仅是在北越的一个部分。还有在南越的人民，他们为争取祖国统一的运动，就是在美国帝国主义和反动派吴庭艳的机关枪、刺刀、鞭子之下被屠杀，在集中营里被谋害，流出鲜血，付出生命，来铺平实现祖国统一的道路！我曾在河内会见越南少数民族——巴拿族的全国知名的民族英雄弩普（是越南小说“祖国站起来了”中的主要人物。此书已翻译，人民文学出版社出版），他是南越昆嵩省安溪县贡花村人。他从十五岁起，就反抗法帝国主义，用原始的武器——石头、柴刀、斧头，后来用地雷来歼灭敌人。当时（1956年）他已四十二岁了，他计算到1955年实现和平为止，他自己亲手歼灭了一百九十五个敌人。而帝国主义用了飞机、大炮、和几千人的兵力，来反复扫荡他的山村数十次，相持经过二十多年，但是帝国主义始终无法摧毁这个顽强不屈的山村。他告诉我们，为了学习军事，为了建立祖国强大的人民军，他离开了南方。他说他的故乡，他的母亲，还在不断地跟美帝国主义和反动派吴庭艳进行反迫害反扫荡的斗争。他要回到南方去，他满怀信心地要为实现祖国统一而斗争。并相信斗争的胜利一定是属于越南人民的。我相信他的话，我相信英勇的越南人民，我相信越南人民的英雄，他们一定能为实现越南的统一取得胜利。全世界爱好和平、主持正义的人民，一定起来积极支持越南人民实现越南统一的斗争！（附图片）
