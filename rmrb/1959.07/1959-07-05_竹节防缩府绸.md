    Bamboo Joint Shrink-Resistant Poplin
    Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Mill recently produced a type of bamboo joint shrink-resistant poplin. Transverse bamboo joint yarns are woven into the fabric surface, creating a beautiful and prominent pattern.
    This fabric has undergone shrink-resistant treatment, resulting in very little shrinkage after washing.

    竹节防缩府绸
    上海第二棉纺厂最近生产了一种竹节防缩府绸。布面上织出横条竹节纱，花纹美观突出。
    这种布经过防缩处理，水洗后缩水很少。
