Xinhua News Agency: Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's dedicated port - the Qingshan Industrial Port - is being accelerated. The current construction projects include a coal wharf, a coke wharf, and two steel wharves. After the completion of this phase of the project, inland river iron barges with a deadweight of 3,000 tons can navigate all year round. The cargo handling capacity of the wharves will be increased by half compared to the current Qingshan temporary wharf, which is of great significance for ensuring the timely transportation of materials, fuel, and other necessities for the construction and production of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation.
