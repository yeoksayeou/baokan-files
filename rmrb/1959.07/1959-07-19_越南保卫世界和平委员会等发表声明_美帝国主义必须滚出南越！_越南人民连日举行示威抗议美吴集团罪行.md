Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 18th: According to reports in today's newspapers, the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee issued a statement on "Vietnam Day" saying that they fully support the letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on July 7, 1959, to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, and once again strongly condemn the acts of American imperialism, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, and the Lao Phoui Sananikone government in undermining the Geneva Accords.

The statement said that American imperialism must get out of South Vietnam and must strictly fulfill the Geneva Accords concerning Vietnam and Laos.

The statement pointed out that the American-Ngo clique is increasingly rampant in undermining the Geneva Accords, plotting to permanently divide Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into an American colony and base of aggression, and is carrying out even more insane massacres and persecutions of former resistance personnel and people who desire peace and reunification.

The statement called on the Vietnamese people to vigorously launch a struggle for the reunification of the motherland and the defense of peace on July 20th – the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords, and expressed heartfelt thanks to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council for calling on the Asian-African people and the people of the world to take July 20th as "Vietnam Day" to promote the cause of peaceful reunification of Vietnam.

The statement expressed admiration for the heroic struggle of the South Vietnamese people and stated that the North Vietnamese people will resolutely support the struggle of the South Vietnamese people.

The statement concluded by pointing out that the current struggle of the Vietnamese people for the reunification of their motherland has received the enthusiastic sympathy and support of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union and the people of Asia, Africa, and the world. American imperialism is becoming increasingly isolated and weakened. The East wind is increasingly prevailing over the West wind. Under the wise leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people will surely achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 17th: The citizens of Hanoi have launched a movement to protest the crimes of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in undermining the Geneva Accords, frantically preparing for war, and massacring patriotic people in South Vietnam. From July 14th to 16th, more than 100,000 people in Hanoi participated in more than 350 protest rallies, and the vast majority of attendees also held demonstrations and marches after the meetings with angry feelings.

Nearly 20,000 women from all walks of life in Hanoi held a protest rally in the Hanoi Municipal Grand Theater Square on the 16th, and adopted a recommendation to the International Commission for Vietnam. The recommendation demanded that the International Commission immediately take effective measures to stop the crimes of the American-Ngo clique.

When the women present held a parade after the meeting, they raised their arms and shouted the slogan "American imperialism get out of South Vietnam!"

More than 30,000 workers and staff from the Hanoi Machinery Factory, the Dunqiao Sawmill, some agencies in Hanoi, some middle schools, and residents of the streets also held protest rallies and demonstrations on the 16th.

More than 200 students in Hanoi also organized a propaganda team to carry out propaganda for "Vietnam Day" on the streets.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 17th: On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the 1954 Geneva Accords, tens of thousands of workers, students, peasants, intellectuals, and religious believers in North Vietnam are taking to the streets day and night with indignation to demonstrate against the crimes of the United States-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in undermining the Geneva Accords, frantically preparing for war, and massacring patriotic people.

For the past five years, the Vietnamese people have struggled unremittingly for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. According to statistics from North Vietnam in the first half of this year, people from all walks of life have held more than 2,000 various large and small protest rallies. This February, when the news came that the South Vietnamese authorities had poisoned more than 1,000 patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp, the struggle of the North Vietnamese people against the atrocities of the American-Ngo clique reached a climax. In the first ten days of this struggle alone, more than 2 million people in North Vietnam participated in protest rallies. 15,000 demonstrations were held in half a year, and more than 4 million people signed the protest book against the Phu Loi atrocities. More than 800 delegations elected by people from all walks of life met with the person in charge of the Hanoi office of the International Commission and submitted more than 60,000 "recommendations" to the International Commission.

    美帝国主义必须滚出南越！
    越南人民连日举行示威抗议美吴集团罪行
    新华社河内18日电　据这里报纸今天报道，越南保卫世界和平委员会和越南亚非人民团结委员会就“越南日”发表声明说，它们全力支持越南民主共和国外交部在1959年7月7日给1954年日内瓦会议两位主席的信，并且再一次严厉谴责美帝国主义、吴庭艳集团和老挝培·萨纳尼空政府破坏日内瓦协议的行为。
    声明说，美帝国主义必须滚出南越，必须严正履行有关越南和老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
    声明指出，美吴集团正在日益猖狂地破坏日内瓦协议，阴谋长期分裂越南和把南越变成美国的殖民地和侵略基地，并且对南越前抗战人员和渴望和平和统一的人民进行更加疯狂的屠杀和迫害。
    声明号召越南人民在7月20日——日内瓦协议签订五周年纪念的日子，大力展开统一祖国和保卫和平的斗争，同时对亚非人民团结理事会号召亚非人民和世界人民把7月20日作为“越南日”以推动越南的和平统一事业，表示衷心的感谢。
    声明对南越人民的英勇斗争表示钦佩，并表示北越人民将坚决支持南越人民的斗争。
    声明最后指出，目前越南人民为统一祖国所进行的斗争，得到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国和亚非以及全世界人民的热烈同情和支持。美帝国主义日益孤立和衰弱。东风日益压倒西风。在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的英明的领导下，越南人民一定会取得最后的胜利。
    新华社河内17日电　河内市民展开了抗议美国和吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议、疯狂备战和屠杀南越爱国人民的罪行的运动。从7月14日到16日，河内有十万多群众先后参加了三百五十多次抗议集会，绝大部分到会者还在会后怀着愤怒心情举行了示威游行。

    到会妇女在会后举行游行时，振臂高呼美帝国主义滚出南越的口号。
    河内机器厂、敦桥锯木厂、河内部分机关、一些中学校的职工、学生以及街道居民共三万多人，也在16日分别举行了抗议集会和示威游行。
    河内学生二百多人还组织了宣传大队，到大街上为“越南日”进行宣传。
    据新华社河内17日电　在1954年日内瓦协议签订将满五周年的今天，越南北方成千上万的工人、学生、农民、知识分子、宗教徒都怀着激愤的心情，不分昼夜地走上街头，为抗议美国—吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议、疯狂备战、屠杀爱国人民的罪行而示威游行。
    五年来，为了争取祖国的和平统一，越南人民奋斗不懈。据全北越今年上半年以来的统计，各界人民举行的各种大小抗议集会达到二千多个。今年2月，南越当局在富利集中营毒害一千多名爱国者的消息传来时，北越人民反对美吴集团暴行的斗争更是达到了高潮。仅在这次斗争的头十天中，全北越就有二百多万人参加了抗议集会。半年来举行了一万五千次示威游行，四百多万人在抗议富利暴行的签名册上签了名。有八百多个各界人民选出的代表团前往会见了国际委员会河内办事处负责人，并且向国际委员会递交了六万多封“建议书”。
