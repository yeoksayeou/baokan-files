Advancing Shoulder to Shoulder
Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

The No. 2 blast furnace of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company has been put into production. This is a joyous event, and I would like to express my congratulations to all the workers who built this blast furnace! And express my gratitude to the Soviet experts who helped us build it! At the same time, I would like to put forward a few expectations to all the workers who are responsible for the production tasks of the blast furnace, hoping that the newly put into production No. 2 blast furnace will advance shoulder to shoulder with the No. 1 blast furnace, which was put into production ten months ago, and strive to be the best.

The No. 2 blast furnace and the No. 1 blast furnace are a pair of "natural" brothers. Apart from the ten-month age difference, other conditions are almost the same. There is no major difference in equipment, raw materials, fuel, and transportation conditions. The management and production personnel are also separated from the same "team." These two blast furnaces have many comparable factors. The brothers stand closely together, and who is higher and who is lower can be seen every day and every hour. This is an excellent condition for carrying out brotherly friendship competitions. Let's compete! Strong steel warriors!

What to compare? Four highs and one low, quality first. "Four highs" means high output, high quality, high efficiency (including labor productivity and equipment utilization rate), and high lifespan (including human safety and longevity, and equipment safety and longevity). "One low" means low cost. "Quality first" is proposed in response to the current tendency of some people to unilaterally pursue quantity and ignore quality. Originally, "more, faster, better, and more economical" is a complete line. "Better" is inseparable from "more, faster, and more economical." Without "better," there cannot be true "more," true "faster," and true "more economical." By the same token, without "more," "faster," and "more economical," there is no such thing as "better." In order to attract people's special attention, it is beneficial to emphasize "quality first" based on our current specific circumstances. The purpose is to comprehensively implement the general line of socialist construction. How to compare? Help each other, learn from each other, strive to be the best, and move forward steadily.

"Helping each other and learning from each other" is the characteristic of socialist competition. This is fundamentally different from capitalist competition. The socialist cause is our common cause. Any victory in the socialist cause in any department or any unit is our common victory. We do not have the selfish and self-serving intentions of the exploiting classes. Our competitors are our close brothers and comrades. The victory of comrades is our own victory, and the difficulties of comrades are our own difficulties. We must often humbly learn from the experiences of our comrades, and at the same time, we must often tell our comrades our own experiences without reservation.

"Strive to be the best and move forward steadily." To compete, we must compare and determine who is better or worse. We must never be content with being at the downstream or in the middle reaches. Unilaterally emphasizing difficulties, or even exaggerating difficulties, without trying every means to overcome difficulties, is a kind of negative emotion. "People ride horses, I ride donkeys, better than those below, but not as good as those above" is also a kind of negative emotion. Not afraid of ghosts, not believing in evil, riding the wind and breaking the waves, and striving to be the best, this communist style is very precious. The enthusiasm of the masses is soaring, and the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution is developing on a large scale. This kind of vigorous atmosphere is very good. We must continue to go all out and advance bravely. The great practice of 1958 has proved that our socialist cause can develop at a high speed and can continue to leap forward. This is beyond doubt. However, victories must be won batch by batch, positions must be occupied one by one, spiral upward, and wave-like advancement are the objective laws of the development of all things. It is always inevitable to have some twists and turns in order to do a good job. Therefore, on the road to advancement, we must scientifically and specifically analyze the situation, and practically discover and solve problems. Through arduous struggle, constantly overcoming weak links, and constantly removing obstacles to advancement, we can further achieve our expected goals.

In order to strive for the best and move forward steadily, we must strengthen management practically and realistically on the basis of the mass movement, using the method of the mass line. The movement of increasing production and practicing economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution should be carried out more deeply and more widely. At the same time, focusing on this central link, strengthen technical management, strengthen the command of production, establish and improve various responsibility systems, and conscientiously implement economic accounting. We must be good at learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, good at learning from the experience of advanced regions and advanced enterprises, good at summarizing the experience of our own units, and good at combining indirect experience with direct experience. We must have a complete set of reasonable rules and regulations. We must use the method of the mass line to review, revise, establish and supplement various rules and regulations. We must make these reasonable rules and regulations deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and turn them into the actual actions of the masses. It is impossible to do things well if there are "no rules to follow" or "rules are not followed." With correct command, with vigorous morale, with superb martial arts, and with strict discipline, we can say with full confidence: "We are a fresh force that is invincible and invincible."

    并肩前进
    中共湖北省委书记处书记  张平化
    武汉钢铁公司炼铁厂第二座高炉投入生产了。这是一件喜事，我谨向建设这座高炉的全体职工表示祝贺！向帮助我们建设的苏联专家表示感谢！同时也向担负高炉生产任务的全体职工提出一点希望，希望新投入生产的二号高炉同十个月以前投入生产的一号高炉并肩前进，力争上游。
    二号高炉和一号高炉，是“天生的”一对兄弟，除了年龄相差十个月之外，其他各项条件差不多是一样的。设备、原料、燃料和交通运输等条件没有大的差别，管理人员和生产人员，也是从一个“班子”里分出来的。这两个高炉可比的因素非常之多，弟兄俩紧紧地站在一起，谁高谁低，每日每时都可以看得见，这是开展兄弟般的友谊竞赛的极好条件。比一比吧！坚强的钢铁战士们！
    比什么？四高一低，质量第一。“四高”就是要产量高，质量高，效率高（包括人的劳动生产率和设备利用率），寿命高（包括人的安全长寿和设备安全长寿）。“一低”就是成本低。“质量第一”是针对目前某些人片面追求数量忽视质量的倾向而提出的。本来“多、快、好、省”是一条完整的路线，“好”同“多、快、省”是分不开的，不好就不可能有真正的多、真正的快、真正的省，同样的道理，不多、不快、不省，也就无所谓好。为了引起人们的特别注意，根据我们当前的具体情况，强调“质量第一”是有益处的，其目的在于全面贯彻社会主义建设总路线。怎样比？互相帮助，互相学习，力争上游，稳步前进。
    “互相帮助，互相学习”，这是社会主义竞赛的特色，这是社会主义竞赛和资本主义的竞争根本不同的地方。社会主义事业，是我们的共同事业，任何一个部门，任何一个单位，在社会主义事业上的任何一个胜利，都是我们共同的胜利。我们没有像剥削阶级那样损人利己的心肠，我们的竞赛对手，是我们亲密的兄弟和战友，战友的胜利就是自己的胜利，战友的困难就是自己的困难。我们要经常地谦虚地学习战友的经验，同时也要经常地毫无保留地把自己的经验告诉自己的战友。
      “力争上游，稳步前进”。要竞赛要比高低，决不能甘居下游或满足于中游。片面地强调困难，甚至夸大困难，而不想尽一切办法去战胜困难，这是一种消极情绪。“人家骑马我骑驴，比上不足比下有余”，这也是一种消极情绪。不怕鬼、不信邪，乘风破浪，力争上游，这种共产主义风格是非常宝贵的。群众的干劲冲天，大规模地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，这种轰轰烈烈的气氛好得很。我们要继续鼓足干劲，奋勇前进。1958年的伟大实践已经证明，我们的社会主义事业，能够高速度地发展，能够不断跃进。这是无可怀疑的。但是，胜利要一批一批地取得，阵地要一个一个地占领，螺旋式向上，波浪式前进，是一切事物发展的客观规律。要办好一件事情，总是难免有些曲折的。因此，在前进的道路上，要科学地具体地分析情况，踏踏实实地发现问题和解决问题。经过艰苦斗争，不断地克服薄弱环节，不断地扫除前进的障碍，才能够进一步地达到我们所预期的目的。
    为了力争上游而又稳步前进，就要在群众运动的基础上，用群众路线的方法，切切实实加强管理。以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动应当更加深入更加广泛地开展。同时，围绕这一中心环节，加强技术管理，加强生产的指挥，建立和健全各项责任制度，认真实行经济核算。我们要善于学习苏联的先进经验，善于学习先进地区和先进企业的经验，善于总结本单位的经验，善于把间接经验和直接经验结合起来。我们一定要有成套的合理的规章制度，一定要用群众路线的方法，审查、修订、建立和补充各项规章制度，一定要使这些合理的规章制度深入人心，变为群众的实际行动。“无章可循”或“有章不循”，是不可能把事情办好的。有了正确的指挥，有了旺盛的士气，有了精良的武艺，又有了严明的纪律，我们就可以满怀信心地说：“我们是攻无不克、战无不胜的生力军”。
