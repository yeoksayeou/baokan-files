Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of Party member cadres from the city's industrial system on the 13th to deploy industrial production for the third quarter. The conference demanded that all factories and mining enterprises, in accordance with the spirit of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, immediately mobilize the broad masses of workers, muster greater revolutionary drive, and launch a mass movement aimed at high output, high quality, high efficiency, and practicing economy to improve labor organization, and vigorously promote technological innovation and technological revolution.

Comrade Peng Zhen attended the meeting and delivered a speech.

Beijing's industrial production has made great leaps forward in the first half of this year, with the total industrial output value increasing by 1.3 times compared to the same period last year, equivalent to one and a half times the total output value for the entire year of 1957. The output and quality of major products have greatly improved, and the technical and economic indicators of many enterprises have also made significant progress. According to an inspection of 342 local industrial factories, among the 1,776 products produced by these factories and mining enterprises, compared with the fourth quarter of last year, the quality of products that improved accounted for 46.9%, those that remained stable at the original level accounted for 49.3%, and those that declined accounted for 3.8%. The comparable product costs for the city's industry in the first five months of this year also decreased by 5.7% compared to last year. However, the tasks for the second half of the year remain very arduous. A large portion of the planned total annual output of many major products still needs to be completed in the second half of the year; the supply of some raw materials and materials will remain relatively tight in the second half of the year; the quality of some products is not high enough, and the consumption of raw materials and materials is still considerably higher compared to advanced units nationwide. Therefore, the conference demanded that the Party organizations and the broad masses of workers in factories and mining enterprises throughout the city fully utilize and develop the rich experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year and in the first half of this year, work hard and vigorously, and fight a splendid and beautiful battle in the third quarter, to lay a solid foundation for victoriously, abundantly, quickly, well, and economically completing the annual production tasks.

Jia Tingsan, member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Minister of Industry, delivered a report on behalf of the Municipal Committee on how to vigorously grasp production in the third quarter. He pointed out that there are many favorable conditions for continuing the Great Leap Forward in the third quarter: enterprise management has been strengthened in the first half of the year; the broad masses of new workers have further improved their political ideology and technical level through the exercise of the Great Leap Forward last year and this year; many units have inspected and repaired equipment; especially, rich experience has been gained in combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements. All of this provides a solid position for continuing to leap forward. The main problem that needs to be solved currently is that some people have developed some degree of slack mood due to complacency or one-sidedness in their thinking methods, which must be corrected. It is necessary to comprehensively and correctly grasp the spirit of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, oppose both subjectivism that deviates from reality and right-leaning conservative thinking. On the basis of mobilizing the masses, and according to the actual situation, greater efforts should be mustered, and advanced production targets and specific measures that can be achieved through effort should be formulated in a realistic manner, and the masses of workers should be organized to complete and strive to overfulfill them.

Regarding the specific measures for grasping production in the third quarter, the report pointed out: it is necessary to mobilize the masses to discuss the production plan for the third quarter, explain the situation and tasks to the masses, launch extensive airing of views and debates, and formulate a plan for increasing production and practicing economy for the third quarter and the second half of the year; while grasping heavy industry, continue to grasp light industry, and use all means to improve the output and quality of light industrial products, increase varieties and designs, and meet market needs; continue to improve product design, utilize waste materials and scraps, clear warehouses, and strengthen material adjustment work, etc., to fully tap the potential of materials and ensure the needs of large-scale production increase. In addition, it is necessary to continue to strengthen enterprise management, strengthen ideological and technical education for new workers, strengthen equipment inspection and maintenance work, and pay attention to safe production.

Jia Tingsan emphasized in his report that continuing the Great Leap Forward in the third quarter must be a comprehensive leap forward that is abundant, quick, good, and economical. While paying attention to output value, attention should also be paid to product quality; while paying attention to increasing production, attention should also be paid to practicing economy; while vigorously launching mass movements, attention should also be paid to centralized leadership and strengthening enterprise management.

Zheng Tianxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the meeting that now there are only seventy-plus days left in the third quarter, time waits for no one, and all units must seize the time to act immediately, convene a workers' representative conference or a factory-wide workers' conference within a week, and formulate a production increase and economy plan for the third quarter.

After the meeting, factories and mining enterprises and competent departments immediately held meetings to specifically deploy the production battle for the third quarter. (Attached pictures)

    紧抓七十多天继续大干特干为完成全年任务打下可靠基础
    北京职工鼓更大干劲大战三季度
    市委要求各企业立即开展以高产量高质量高效率和厉行节约为目标的群众运动
    新华社15日讯　中共北京市委13日召开全市工业系统党员干部大会部署第三季度工业生产。大会要求各厂矿企业根据党的社会主义建设总路线的精神，立即发动广大职工，鼓足更大的革命干劲，开展一个以高产量、高质量、高效率和厉行节约为目标的改善劳动组织、大闹技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。
    彭真同志出席了大会，并讲了话。
    北京今年上半年工业生产跃进步伐很大，工业总产值比去年同期增长一点三倍，相当于1957年全年总产值的一倍半。主要产品的产量和质量有很大提高，很多企业的技术经济指标也都有显著进步。据地方工业三百四十二个工厂的检查，在这些厂矿企业生产的一千七百七十六种产品中，和去年第四季度比较，产品质量有了提高的占46.9％，稳定在原有水平上的占49.3％，下降的有3.8％。全市工业今年头五个月的可比产品成本也比去年降低了5.7％。但是下半年的任务仍然非常艰巨。许多主要产品的全年总产量计划，还有很大一部分需要依靠下半年完成；下半年有些原料、材料的供应仍然比较紧张；有些产品的质量还不够高，原料材料的消耗额同全国的先进单位比较还相当大。因此，大会要求全市厂矿企业的党组织和广大职工充分运用和发扬去年和今年上半年大跃进的丰富经验，大干特干，在第三季度打个出色的漂亮仗，为胜利地、又多又快又好又省地完成全年的生产任务打下可靠的基础。
    中共北京市委常委、工业部部长贾庭三代表市委就如何大抓第三季度生产作了报告。他指出：第三季度继续大跃进，有很多有利条件：上半年企业管理工作加强了；广大新工人经过去年和今年大跃进的锻炼，政治思想和技术水平有了进一步的提高；很多单位对设备进行了检查和维修；特别是在集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合方面取得了丰富的经验。所有这一切，都为继续向前跃进提供了巩固的阵地。当前需要解决的主要问题是，有些人由于骄傲自满，或者思想方法上的片面性，产生了一些不同程度的松劲情绪，必须纠正。必须全面地正确地掌握党的社会主义建设总路线的精神，既要反对脱离实际的主观主义，又要反对右倾保守思想。应该在发动群众的基础上，根据实际情况，鼓足更大的干劲，实事求是地订出经过努力可以达到的先进的生产指标和具体措施，并组织职工群众完成和力争超额完成。
    关于抓第三季度生产的具体措施，报告指出：要发动群众讨论第三季度生产计划，向群众说明情况、任务，展开大鸣大放，订出第三季度和下半年的增产节约计划；抓重工业的同时，继续抓好轻工业，用一切办法提高轻工业产品的产量、质量，增加花色品种，满足市场需要；继续改进产品设计，利用废料、下脚料，清理仓库，加强物资调剂工作等，以充分挖掘物资潜力，保证大增产的需要。此外，要继续加强企业管理工作，加强对新工人的思想教育和技术教育，加强设备的检查和维修工作，注意安全生产。
    贾庭三在报告中强调指出，第三季度继续大跃进，必须是多快好省的全面跃进，注意产值，同时也要注意产品质量，注意增产也要注意节约，大搞群众运动，同时要注意集中领导，加强企业管理。
    中共北京市委书记处书记郑天翔在会上说，现在第三季度只剩下了七十多天，机不可失，时不再来，各单位要抓紧时间立即行动起来，在一星期内，召开职工代表大会或全厂职工大会，制订出第三季的增产节约计划。
    在大会结束以后，各厂矿企业和主管部门立即纷纷召开会议，具体部署三季度的生产战役。（附图片）
