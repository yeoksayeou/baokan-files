Xinhua News Agency, July 18th -- The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power recently put forward targets for conserving coal in thermal power generation nationwide, requiring national thermal power plants to save 2.5% of coal usage in the second half of the year based on the actual coal consumption in the first half of the year.

Thermal power plants are among the largest coal consumers in the country, accounting for about 12% of the country's total coal production and more than 50% of the total electricity generation cost. In the past few years, the national electricity sector has achieved great success in conserving coal, and the coal consumption indicators have significantly decreased year by year. In the first quarter of this year, the national average coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated was reduced by approximately 0.4 kilograms compared to 1949. However, analyzing the specific situation within the power industry, there is still considerable potential for saving coal. Some power plants can greatly reduce coal loss and unnecessary waste during combustion by further strengthening coal consumption management. Furthermore, there is a significant disparity in the coal consumption indicators achieved by different plants. For example, the Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant's average standard coal consumption per kilowatt-hour in June was 0.471 kilograms, while power plants with similar conditions often exceeded this figure. It is evident that a large amount of coal can be saved by raising the performance of backward power plants to the level of advanced ones.

The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power requires all plants to pay attention to further improving the thermal efficiency of steam turbines, boilers, and the entire plant when taking measures to reduce coal consumption. They are also requested to promote advanced boiler operating experience, strive to reduce various heat losses, and pay attention to eliminating equipment defects and various leaks during maintenance. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the operation and adjustment of new equipment, so that the large number of new generating units put into production in the second half of the year can consistently maintain high-efficiency operation and fully utilize their role in reducing coal consumption. Thirdly, designated personnel should be responsible for establishing systems to improve coal management and prevent loss.

In order to do a good job in the above tasks, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power also instructed all plants: on the one hand, they should vigorously mobilize the masses to come up with ideas and find solutions to the main problems of their plants; on the other hand, they should strive to improve enterprise management, strengthen the analysis of economic indicators such as coal consumption, thermal efficiency, and various heat losses, and constantly point out the direction of efforts to improve thermal efficiency to workers.

In addition to reducing coal consumption, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power also called on all power plants to use low-quality coal from local or nearby coal mines as much as possible, without affecting local electricity load, to save good quality coal for other industries.

### 水利电力部要求全国火电厂  节约煤炭提高热效率

    水利电力部要求全国火电厂
    节约煤炭提高热效率
    新华社18日讯　水利电力部最近提出了全国火力发电方面节约用煤的指标，要求全国火力发电厂在上半年实际耗煤量的基础上，下半年节约用煤2.5％。
    火力发电厂是全国最大的用煤户之一，全年用煤量约占全国煤炭总产量12％左右，占发电总成本50％以上。过去几年中，全国电业部门在节约用煤方面获得了很大成绩，历年煤耗指标都有显著降低。今年第一季度，全国平均每发一度电耗用的煤炭，比1949年降低了零点四公斤左右。但是，从电力工业内部的具体情况来分析，节约用煤还有相当大的潜力，有些电厂只要进一步加强对煤耗的管理，就可以大大减少存煤失散和燃烧过程中不应有的损耗。再从各厂达到的煤耗指标来对比，高低也很悬殊。例如，天津第一发电厂6月份平均每发一度电消耗标准煤零点四七一公斤，而其他条件相近的电厂却往往高于此数。可见只要把落后的电厂提高到先进水平，就能节约大量煤炭。
    水利电力部要求各厂在采取降低煤耗的措施时，首先要注意进一步提高汽轮机、锅炉及全厂的热效率，推广先进锅炉的操作经验，努力减少各种热损失，并在检修时注意消除设备缺陷和各种泄漏现象；其次，要加强新设备的运行调整工作，使下半年投入生产的大量新发电机组都能经常保持高效率的运行，充分发挥它们对降低煤耗的作用；第三，指定专人负责，订出制度，改善燃煤管理工作，防止失散。
    为了做好上述各项工作，水利电力部还指示各厂：一方面，应大力发动群众针对本厂的主要问题，想办法，找窍门；另一方面，要努力改进企业管理，加强对煤耗、热效率各项热损失等经济指标的分析，经常向工人指出提高热效率的努力方向。
    除了降低煤耗以外，水利电力部还号召各电厂在不影响当地电力负荷的条件下，尽量掺用当地或附近煤矿的低质煤，节约好煤支援其他工业。
