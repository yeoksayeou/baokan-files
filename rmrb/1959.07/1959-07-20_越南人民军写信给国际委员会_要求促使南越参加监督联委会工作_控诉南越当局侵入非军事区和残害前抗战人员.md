Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Vietnam News Agency reported that the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army recently sent three letters in succession to the International Commission in Vietnam.

    In one letter, the Liaison Delegation requested that South Vietnamese authorities be urged to send representatives to the Vietnam Supervisory and Control Joint Commission to implement the Geneva Accords and to help restore their normal activities.

    Since the forces of the French Federation withdrew from Vietnam in April 1956, in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the Vietnam Supervisory and Control Central Joint Commission and the Demilitarized Zone Joint Commission have ceased their activities.

    The letter pointed out that, in the situation where the Vietnamese people are urgently demanding peace and national unification, the restoration of the activities of the Joint Commissions is an extremely necessary and urgent step. The letter stated that the International Commission, in its Ninth Interim Report, emphasized that "prompt action by both sides through the Joint Commission" to resolve several outstanding issues relating to the Demilitarized Zone "is of extreme importance for maintaining the demilitarized character of the Demilitarized Zone, the clear intention of establishing this demilitarized zone being to make it a buffer zone and to avoid any events that might cause the resumption of hostilities."

    After condemning the South Vietnamese authorities for their repeated and shameless sabotage of the Demilitarized Zone, the letter stated that the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army has been prepared to discuss with the Southern authorities the early restoration of the activities of the Joint Commissions.

    In another letter, the Liaison Delegation condemned the South Vietnamese authorities for their systematic and comprehensive violation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords concerning the Demilitarized Zone in the past five years.

    The letter pointed out that, according to incomplete statistics, the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have dispatched armed forces ranging from a platoon to a battalion into the area 144 times without legal authorization. Therefore, there have been more than two thousand recorded incidents of daily illegal intrusions by American military personnel and military and administrative personnel of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique into the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone.

    Military aircraft and warships belonging to the armed forces of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, trained, equipped, and commanded by the United States, have violated the airspace and territorial waters of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fifty-one times.

    The Liaison Delegation requested the Vietnam International Commission to take measures to ensure that all armed forces illegally stationed in the Demilitarized Zone are withdrawn, and that the buffer nature of the Demilitarized Zone can be respected.

    In another letter from the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army to the Vietnam International Commission, a protest was lodged against the South Vietnamese authorities for imprisoning 3,402 former resistance personnel in the Con Dao Island concentration camp and cruelly mistreating them.

    The letter pointed out that former resistance personnel imprisoned in the Con Dao Island concentration camp are dying every day due to cruel mistreatment. Taking Prison No. 1 as an example, 360 people died from December 1956 to April 1958 alone. Many of the dead were put in sacks and then thrown into the sea.

    In the letter, the People's Army Liaison Delegation requested the International Commission to immediately send a mobile team with liaison officers from both sides to Con Dao Island for investigation, and to negotiate with the South Vietnamese authorities, forcing them to immediately dissolve the Con Dao Island concentration camp, restore the freedom of the aforementioned former resistance personnel, and guarantee their democratic freedoms in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

    越南人民军写信给国际委员会
    要求促使南越参加监督联委会工作
    控诉南越当局侵入非军事区和残害前抗战人员
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：越南通讯社报道：越南人民军总司令部联络代表团最近连续给越南国际委员会写了三封信。
    在一封信里，联络代表团要求促使南越当局派代表出席越南监察和监督联合委员会以执行日内瓦协议，并且帮助恢复它们的正常活动。
    自从法兰西联邦部队根据日内瓦协议的规定，在1956年4月撤出越南以来，越南监察和监督中央联合委员会和非军事区联合委员会一直没有进行活动。
    这封信指出，在越南人民迫切要求和平与民族统一的情况下，恢复联合委员会的活动是一个极其必要和迫切的步骤。信件说，国际委员会在它的第九次临时报告中强调指出，“双方通过联合委员会采取迅速的行动”来解决若干有关非军事区的未决问题，“对于保持非军事区的非军事性质有极大的重要性，建立这个非军事区的明显意图是使它成为一个缓冲区，并避免任何可能造成敌对行为的恢复的事件。”
    这封信在谴责南越当局多次无耻地破坏非军事区的行为后表示，越南人民军总司令部一直准备同南方当局讨论早日恢复联合委员会的活动问题。
    在另一封信中，联络代表团谴责南越当局在过去五年中系统、全面地破坏日内瓦协议关于非军事区部分的各项条款。
    这封信指出，据不完全的统计，美国和吴庭艳集团曾经一百四十四次未经合法的许可派遣一个排到一个营的武装部队进入这个地区。因此，美国军事人员以及吴庭艳集团的军事人员和行政人员日常非法侵入非军事区南部的事件，经记录在案的已经有二千多起。
    属于吴庭艳集团的美国训练、装备和指挥的武装部队的军用飞机和军舰五十一次侵犯了越南民主共和国的领空和领水。
    联络代表团要求越南国际委员会采取措施，以便使非法驻在非军事区的一切武装部队撤出，并且使非军事区的缓冲性质能够得到尊重。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团写信给越南国际委员会的又一封信中，抗议南越当局把三千四百零二名前抗战人员监禁在昆仑岛集中营里，并且残酷地虐待他们。
    信中指出，被监禁在昆仑岛集中营里的前抗战人员，由于受到残暴的虐待，每天都有人死亡。仅以第一号监牢为例，从1956年12月到1958年4月为止，就有三百六十人死亡。许多死者被装进麻袋，然后扔进海里。
    人民军联络代表团在信中要求国际委员会立即派出有双方联络官参加的机动小组到昆仑岛进行调查，同时向南越当局交涉，迫使他们立即解散昆仑岛集中营，恢复上述前抗战人员的自由，并按照日内瓦协议的规定保证这些人的民主自由权利。
