Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 27th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro held a press conference this afternoon, discussing Cuba's attitude towards the convocation of the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Twenty-One American States, and answered some questions raised by reporters.

Castro said that there is no tension in Cuba; the tension only exists in countries suffering from tyranny. Castro stated that Cuba's attitude at the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas will remain the same as its attitude within the Organization of American States. He said that Cuba has a cheerful and united people, so Cuba is not afraid of any aggression.

Castro emphasized the importance of economic cooperation among Latin American countries. He said, "We are making every necessary effort to ensure that Latin American countries achieve economic liberation." Castro said that the Cuban government sympathizes with the establishment of a Latin American common market, which can guarantee the comprehensive development of our people. We will all unite to deal with competition from countries outside the common market. He said that he believes that the attitude of Brazilian President Kubitschek is correct because the Latin American people should consider using their own resources to solve their problems.

An American reporter asked, "When the land of American investors is requisitioned in accordance with the Land Reform Law, what will happen if they do not agree to compensation paid in bonds?" Castro said in response to this question, "Whether they are Cubans or foreign expatriates in Cuba, they must respect our laws."

When asked whether the Cuban army would participate in the joint defense of the continent, Castro said, "The United States is trying to standardize the armies of Latin America and put them under its joint command. I am not interested in this. We have nothing in common with this. The Cuban Rebel Army only serves Cuba."

Speaking of relations with other countries, Prime Minister Castro said that all countries have the right to establish diplomatic and economic relations with other countries in the world. It is just that the country's huge problems make the government unable to decide on such issues.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 27th: Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Raúl Castro said yesterday at a mass rally of millions in the capital that the unity of the people of the whole country is the greatest guarantee for achieving revolutionary victory.

Raúl Castro first stated that the Cuban armed forces firmly support land reform. He listed facts to illustrate this point, and pointed out that the army is only a part of the people who put on military uniforms.

Raúl Castro emphasized that in the face of the threat of aggression, all the Cuban people must unite. He said that there may be aggression and the landing of invaders, and now counter-revolutionaries are planning to assassinate Fidel Castro and other major revolutionary leaders. However, we have the collective vigilance of a people who are increasingly united in the face of a common enemy. A united people is the greatest guarantee for defending our country. The people are the most powerful revolutionary army. When the people take to the streets, the schemers will tremble. He said that such conferences should be convened whenever the situation requires it. Now it is increasingly necessary to unite the people.

Speaking of the importance of the unity of the Latin American people, Raúl Castro said that the moment of independence for the entire Latin American continent is coming. The Cuban revolution is not just for our people. We believe that all the disasters in our brother republics come from the same source, and the root of the trouble is the same. Our country's misfortune and future determine the misfortune and future of the entire Latin America. He pointed out that our Latin American brothers will not let their Cuban brothers fight alone. Our Latin American brothers regard the Cuban revolution as their own revolution, and, as our brothers, they will defend the revolution with us.

    古巴人民团结一致保卫革命
    卡斯特罗总理强调古巴不害怕任何侵略
    武装部队总司令表示军队坚决支持土改
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天下午举行了记者招待会，谈到关于古巴对召开美洲二十一国外长会议的态度，并且回答了记者们所提出的一些问题。
    卡斯特罗说，古巴不存在紧张局势，紧张局势仅仅存在于那些遭受暴政蹂躏的国家里。卡斯特罗表示，古巴在美洲外长会议上的态度将仍然是它在美洲国家组织中所持的态度。他说，古巴有心情愉快的团结一致的人民，因此古巴不害怕任何侵略。
    卡斯特罗强调指出拉丁美洲国家之间经济合作的重要意义。他说，我们正进行一切必要的努力来争取拉丁美洲国家获得经济上的解放。卡斯特罗说，古巴政府同情建立拉丁美洲共同市场，它可以保证我们各国人民的全面发展，我们大家将普遍联合起来对付共同市场之外的国家的竞争。他说，他认为巴西总统库比契克的态度是正确的，因为拉丁美洲人民应该考虑用他们自己的资源解决他们的问题。
    一个美国记者问道，在根据土改法征用美国投资家的土地时，如果他们不同意用债券支付赔偿，那么怎么办呢？卡斯特罗在回答这个问题时说，无论是古巴人还是在古巴的外国侨民都得尊重我国的法律。
    在回答古巴军队是否会参与共同保卫大陆的问题时，卡斯特罗说，美国企图使拉丁美洲的军队标准化，把它们置于它的共同指挥之下，我对这不感兴趣。我们与此毫无共同之处。古巴起义军仅仅为古巴服务。
    在谈到同其他国家的关系时，卡斯特罗总理说，各个国家都有权和世界上其他国家建立外交和经济关系。只是本国的巨大问题使政府无暇决定这类问题。
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　古巴武装部队总司令劳尔·卡斯特罗昨天在首都百万人的群众大会上发表演说时说，全国人民的团结一致是取得革命胜利的最大保证。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗首先表示，古巴的武装部队对土地改革给以坚决的支持。他列举事实说明这一点，并且指出军队只不过是穿起军装的一部分人民。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗强调指出，在侵略的威胁下，全体古巴人民必须团结一致。他说，可能会发生侵略和入侵者的登陆，而现在反革命正计划谋害菲德尔·卡斯特罗和其他主要革命领袖。但是，我们有面对共同的敌人日益加强团结的人民的集体警惕。团结一致的人民是保卫我国的最大的保证。人民是一支最强大的革命军。当人民走上街头时阴谋家们就要发抖了。他说，像这样的大会每当形势有所要求时，就应该召开，现在越来越有必要把人民团结起来。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗在谈到拉丁美洲人民团结的重要性时说，整个拉丁美洲大陆独立的时刻正在到来。古巴革命不仅仅是我国人民的。我们相信，我们的兄弟共和国的一切灾难都是来自同一根源，祸根都是一个。我国的不幸和前途决定着整个拉丁美洲的不幸和前途。他指出，我们拉丁美洲的兄弟们将不会让他们的古巴兄弟孤军作战。我们拉丁美洲的兄弟们把古巴革命当作他们自己的革命，并且，作为我们的兄弟，他们将与我们一起保卫革命。
