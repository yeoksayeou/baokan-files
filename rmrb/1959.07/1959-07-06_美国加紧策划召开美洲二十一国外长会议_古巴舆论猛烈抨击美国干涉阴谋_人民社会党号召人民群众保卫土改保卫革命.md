　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch. The United States is intensifying its planning to interfere in the national revolutionary movements in Cuba and the Caribbean Sea through the "Organization of American States." This conspiracy has been fiercely criticized by Cuban public opinion.

　　On July 1, the day after Eisenhower openly demanded that the "Organization of American States" "take the initiative" to interfere in the internal affairs of Caribbean countries, the representative of the Dominican dictatorship to the "Organization of American States" fabricated the so-called "invasion" of the Dominican Republic instigated by Cuba at the organization's Council meeting and demanded that the organization intervene. Subsequently, the U.S. government actively prepared to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of twenty-one American nations to plan armed intervention.

　　According to a July 3 report by United Press International, U.S. diplomatic sources revealed that the aforementioned meeting was likely to be held in Washington during the week of July 13 in order to study the "dangerous situation in the Caribbean." The content of the meeting included "the 'dispute' between the Dominican Republic and Cuba and Venezuela and the activities of exiles throughout the region who are focused on overthrowing governments like Nicaragua and Haiti." The news pointed out that a U.S. diplomat believed that "the United States may make a decision before the Organization of American States Council meeting on Monday to debate the Dominican Republic's demands."

　　The U.S. "Washington Post" revealed that the Dominican dictatorship is actively recruiting soldiers in Spain, preparing to launch a military offensive against Cuba. The newspaper said in an article published on July 1 that about 800 Spanish mercenaries released from General Franco's military prisons are now in the Dominican Republic preparing to attack Cuba. The cafes and streets of Trujillo City are also full of Batista's officers, "their numbers arriving here day by day, determined to launch a counter-offensive."

　　In order to stop international and domestic counter-revolutionary conspiracies, the Executive Bureau of the National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party held a meeting on the 3rd to analyze the current situation in Cuba, pointing out that the international conspiracies and domestic counter-revolutionary activities instigated by U.S. imperialism are intensifying, and they are attempting to prevent the implementation of land reform and undermine the Cuban revolution. The meeting decided to further mobilize workers, peasants, and the masses to implement land reform and defend the revolution.

　　Cuban newspapers published commentaries on the 3rd and 4th, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialism and the "Organization of American States" for their criminal role in the anti-Cuban conspiracy. "Hoy" pointed out that the provocation launched by the Dominican dictatorship at the meeting of the Council of the "Organization of American States" is part of an imperialist conspiracy plan formulated by Washington, namely, to further intervene in Cuba and Venezuela through the "Organization of American States." "Combate" pointed out that this organization played a criminal role in the armed intervention in Guatemala in 1954. "Revolución" and "Alerta" condemned the "Organization of American States" as a tool used by U.S. imperialism to protect Latin American dictatorships.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯，美国正在加紧策划经由“美洲国家组织”干涉古巴和加勒比海的民族革命运动。这个阴谋遭到了古巴舆论界的猛烈抨击。
    在艾森豪威尔7月1日公然要求“美洲国家组织”“采取主动”以干涉加勒比海各国内政的第二天，多米尼加独裁政权驻“美洲国家组织”的代表便在这个组织的理事会会议上捏造所谓古巴策动了对多米尼加的“入侵”，并要求这个组织进行干涉。接着，美国政府积极准备召开美洲二十一国外长会议，部署武装干涉。
    据合众国际社3日报道，美国外交人士透露，在7月13日的那个星期就有可能在华盛顿举行上述会议，以便研究“危险的加勒比海局势”。这次会议讨论的内容，包括“多米尼加同古巴和委内瑞拉之间的‘争端’和整个地区流亡者的活动，这些流亡者专注于推翻像尼加拉瓜和海地这样一些政府。”消息指出，一位美国外交家认为，“在星期一美洲国家组织理事会举行会议辩论多米尼加的要求之前，美国可能作出决定。”
    美国“华盛顿邮报”透露，多米尼加独裁政权正在西班牙招兵买马，积极准备发动对古巴的军事进攻。这家报纸在7月1日发表的一篇文章中说，从佛朗哥将军的军事监牢出来的约八百名西班牙雇佣兵，现在正在多米尼加准备进攻古巴。充斥在特鲁希略城的咖啡馆和街道上的还有许多巴蒂斯塔的军官，“他们到这里来的人数一天比一天多，他们决心要来一次反攻”。
    为了制止国际的和国内的反革命阴谋，古巴人民社会党全国委员会执行局在3日举行的会议，分析了古巴目前的局势，指出美帝国主义所策动的国际阴谋和国内反革命活动正在变本加厉，他们企图阻止土地改革的实行，并破坏古巴革命。会议决定：进一步动员工人、农民和人民群众实现土地改革和保卫革命。
    古巴报纸在3日和4日连续发表评论，强烈谴责美帝国主义和“美洲国家组织”在反古巴阴谋中所起的罪恶作用。“今日报”指出，多米尼加独裁政权在“美洲国家组织”理事会会议上所发动的挑衅，是华盛顿拟定的帝国主义阴谋计划的一部分，即通过“美洲国家组织”进一步对古巴和委内瑞拉进行干涉。“战斗报”指出，在1954年发生的武装干涉危地马拉的事件中，这个组织就起过罪恶的作用。“国民报”和“至上报”谴责“美洲国家组织”是美帝国主义用来保护拉丁美洲独裁政权的工具。
