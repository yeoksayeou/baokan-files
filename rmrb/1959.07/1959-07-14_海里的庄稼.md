Sea Crops
By Our Correspondent Zhang Xiangbo

Summer solstice. A strong salty smell permeates the hundred-mile-long coast of Dalian. Kelp, known as "sea crops," is beginning to be harvested.

Dalian City is located at the tip of the Liaodong Peninsula, with a cool climate and clear seawater, making it a good place for kelp cultivation in China. On a clear day, standing at a high point and looking out to sea, one can see winding rafts, undulating with the gentle waves, like neatly arranged rice paddies. Between the rows, thousands of small boats shuttle back and forth. The male and female workers on the boats laboriously drag the kelp from under the rafts and send it to the shore. Thus, small mountains of kelp appear on the long sandy beaches. On the roads leading to the city, trucks carrying kelp processing equipment rush back and forth, stirring up clouds of dust...

	From Nothing to Abundance

News of large-scale kelp harvests keeps coming from the coast. Aquatic product workers from Yantai City came to Dalian to express their congratulations to their counterparts. As people excitedly discussed the bumper harvest, old worker Gao Weicheng interestingly introduced to us the history of kelp cultivation in Dalian: In the past, Dalian did not cultivate kelp. In 1927, kelp seedlings may have been attached to the bottom of a foreign merchant ship and landed in the Dalian sea. Thus, kelp began to propagate. Soon, people realized that kelp seeds were very active and had a characteristic of liking to attach and grow, so they threw rocks into the shallows for it to attach to. However, this natural cultivation method was not easily controlled by humans, so until 1950, the annual output was only a few hundred tons. In 1955, people accidentally discovered a lush cluster of kelp hanging on a piece of wood floating in the sea. Why did kelp grow so luxuriantly when floating? Many people thought about this question. Later, they realized that this allowed it to get plenty of sunlight. From then on, Dalian City began to use bamboo tubes and plastic bags to make rafts for artificial kelp cultivation. This experiment was successful. By 1958, Dalian had cultivated 7,200 rafts and harvested 23,000 tons of kelp, a figure that exceeded the total harvest of the past thirty years.

Although so much kelp has been produced, it is still in short supply. This year, the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has mobilized tremendous forces and cultivated more than 45,000 rafts, more than five times the number last year. Recently, more than 50,000 tons of kelp have been harvested, but the rafts at sea still seem endless.

	Exceeding National Records

In the struggle for a bumper kelp harvest in Dalian, countless outstanding cultivation experts have emerged. The "Six Sisters Rocket Team" of the Xiaoping Island Farm is one of them. The leader of the "Rocket Team" is Zhang Jinzhi, who is twenty-one years old this year; the youngest is Liu Shuhuan, who is seventeen years old this year. Last year, they heard that the labor model Cao Yongfa's team produced 17.6 tons of kelp (fresh) per mu (1,000 square meters), which caused a sensation in the national aquatic products industry, so they discussed catching up with them this year.

Kelp is a cold-loving plant. In January, seedlings that are three inches long must be clamped in palm ropes, hung on rafts, and put into the sea to grow. At that time, working at sea, the north wind was whistling, and the coldness of putting your hands in the water was indescribable. However, the Rocket Team, fearing to delay time, insisted on working until the sky was full of stars, still shaking small boats and using flashlights to illuminate and rush to clamp the seedlings. Later, they often drove small boats to patrol at sea. When they saw that the kelp was turning yellow, they collected hundreds of pottery pots with sandy eyes from the farm, filled them with chemical fertilizer, and hung them under the rafts to nourish the kelp with the fertilizer water seeping from the pots.

On June 21, the six sisters were filled with joy. Their kelp was about to be harvested. Li Dongchao, Deputy Mayor of Dalian City, led some cadres and came by boat for inspection. Clusters of kelp like streamers swayed in the clear blue sea, the large ones being more than ten feet long. Each rope of kelp weighed at least fifteen catties, and many weighed twenty catties. A total of 6,000 ropes were hung on the one mu and six fen of sea surface that the six sisters were responsible for. After weighing them one by one, the total output was 89.665 tons, an average yield of more than 55 tons per mu, more than twice the national record of last year.

	Experienced Many Risks

In order to achieve a bumper kelp harvest, the cultivators have fought many successful battles against natural disasters. The high-yield record creator Cao Yongfa's team of sixteen people carefully cultivated 83 rafts of kelp, full of confidence in cultivating a batch of "kelp kings."

The sea is unpredictable. On April 19, the sea breeze was gentle during the day, and seagulls fluttered on the waves. Who knew that a level nine storm would blow up late at night. Cao Yongfa woke up from his sleep and rushed to the door to poke his head out. His hair was whistling in the wind. What about the rafts? The seven people in the room looked at the team leader. Cao Yongfa shouted urgently, "Protect the rafts!" and led everyone to jump on a small boat, stepping on the raging waves, and rushed to the farm. At first glance, the rafts were blown crooked and squeezed together, and a large amount of kelp was missing. As soon as it dawned, Cao Yongfa led his partners to rescue them. Everyone secured the rafts as they were, and divers jumped into the seabed ten meters deep to re-hang the kelp that had fallen off the rafts, fighting hard for five days and nights, and finally completed the rescue mission. From then on, they became more vigilant and often patrolled by boat late at night, "keeping watch" for the kelp. As the water temperature gradually increased, the workers lowered the kelp to the lower layer of water to "escape the heat"; after a long time, fearing that it would rot without sunlight, they hurriedly lifted it up for a "sunbath." In this way, in less than two months, the kelp grew vigorously again. The 83 rafts occupied nearly 30 mu of sea surface, and the harvest per mu reached about 20 tons, surpassing the national record they created last year on a large area. What is even more gratifying is that the "Kelp King" was born. Several roots were as long as six meters, 50 centimeters wide, and dark black, and one person could not lift them. People said that it is qualified to enter the exhibition hall!

	Catching the Tide, Busy Processing

Kelp is very delicate. It will rot if the water temperature is higher than 15 degrees; raindrops will also leave white spots. Therefore, as soon as it gets warm, we must rush to harvest and process it. Now, many factories, government agencies, and troops in Dalian City have transferred a large amount of manpower and material resources to support aquatic workers in rushing to harvest, transport, and process. Recently, the tide here is high at night. In order to catch the tide and transport kelp to the shore, whenever the moonlight is hazy, hundreds of miles of coastline and thousands of boats are launched at the same time, which is very lively. The land is even more tense. Some people carry baskets and run wildly, while others push carts and chase closely, transporting the kelp unloaded from the boats to the pickling ponds, sprinkling salt to prevent it from rotting. In this way, one or two thousand tons of kelp can be harvested and processed every day. On sunny days, women lay the kelp one by one on the hot beach to dry, so as to pack and transport it to other places to supply the market. The kelp roots are cut off and sent to processing plants to manufacture iodine and other chemical products. (Attached picture)

### 海里的庄稼

    海里的庄稼
    本报记者　张向波
    夏至，绵亘百里的旅大海岸弥漫着浓烈的咸味。素称“海里庄稼”的海带，开始收获了。
    旅大市地处辽东半岛的尖端，气候凉爽，海水澄澈，是我国养殖海带的好地方。晴天站在高处，极目海洋，只见蜿蜒的浮筏，随着细浪动荡，像埂垄整齐的稻田。埂垄间，有千百叶小船穿来游去。船上的男女工人，把在浮筏下边的海带，吃力地拖上来，送到岸边。于是漫长的沙滩上便出现了一个个海带的小山。在通向市内的道路上，运海带加工器材的汽车，带着团团烟尘，往返急驰……
        从无到多
    海带大面积丰产的消息连连从海边传来。前来参观的烟台市水产工作者，向旅大同行表示祝贺。当人们兴高采烈地谈论丰收的时候，老工人高渭成有趣地向我们介绍了旅大养殖海带的历史：从前，旅大并没有养殖过海带。1927年，可能是外国商船船底附着海带幼芽，落在旅大海里。这样海带便繁殖起来了。不久，人们看出海带种子十分活跃，有喜欢附着生长的特性，便向浅滩投入石块，让它附着生长。但这种自然养殖方法，人工不易控制，因此，直到1950年年产量还只是几百吨。1955年，人们偶然发现海中飘浮的一块木板上，挂着一簇茂盛的海带。飘浮着的海带为什么生长特别茂盛？许多人想着这个问题。后来才认识到这样能使它得到充足的阳光。从此，旅大市便开始用竹筒和胶袋造筏子，人工养殖海带。这个试验是成功了。到1958年旅大便养殖了七千二百筏，收割了海带两万三千吨，这个数字超过了过去三十年收获量的总和。
    海带虽然生产了这么多，但仍供不应求。今年中共旅大市委调集了巨大力量，养殖了四万五千多筏，比去年增加了五倍多。最近已收割海带五万多吨，可是海上的筏子仍然望不到边际。
    超过全国纪录
    旅大在争取海带大丰收当中，涌现了无数出色的养殖能手，小平岛养殖场的“六姊妹火箭班”就是其中的一个。“火箭班”的班长叫张金枝，今年二十一岁；最小的叫刘淑环，今年十七岁。去年她们听说劳动模范曹永发小组每亩（一千平方米）出产十七点六吨海带（鲜品），轰动了全国水产界，便商量今年赶上他们。
    海带是喜寒的植物，1月份就得把三寸来长的苗子夹在棕绳里，挂上浮筏，放下海去，让它生长。当时在海上作业，北风飒飒，手伸在水里那寒冷是难说的。但是，火箭班怕耽误时间，坚持干活，直到满天星斗，还摇着小船，用手电照亮，突击夹苗。以后她们时时驾着小船在海上转游，看到有海带黄稍了，就从场里领来数百个带砂眼的陶罐，装满化肥，吊在浮筏下边，用罐内渗出的肥水滋养海带。
    6月21日，六姊妹心里充满了欢乐。她们的海带要收割了。旅大市副市长李东潮带着一些干部，驾着小船前来验收。一簇簇像飘带般的海带，在碧蓝的海水中荡漾，大的竟有一丈多长。一绳海带少的十五斤，多的二十斤。六姊妹负责的一亩六分海面上，共挂了六千绳，一一过秤，总产量是八十九点六六五吨，平均亩产五十五吨多，超过了去年的全国纪录两倍。
    历经几多风险
    养殖工人们为了海带大丰收，和自然灾害作了多次胜利的搏斗。高产纪录的创造者曹永发小组，十六个人把八十三筏海带侍弄得壮壮实实，满有信心地培植着一批“海带王”。
    大海无常，4月19日白天，海风温柔，海鸥在水波上翩翩飞舞。那知深夜刮起了九级风暴，曹永发从睡梦中惊醒，奔到门口向外一探头，头发被吹得飕飕直响。筏子怎么样？同屋七人望着组长。曹永发急促地喊了一声“护筏！”便带领大伙跳上小船，踏着暴怒的浪头，赶到养殖场。一看，筏子被吹得歪歪扭扭，挤在一块，大量海带不知去向。天刚亮，曹永发就带领伙伴抢救。大家把筏子照原样打牢，潜水员跳到十米深的海底，将脱筏的海带重新挂好，战苦五昼夜，终于完成了抢救任务。从此，他们提高了警惕，往往深夜驾船巡视，为海带“打更”。水温渐高，工人们把海带降到水层下边“避暑”；时间长了，怕它不见阳光发烂，又赶忙提上来个“日光浴”。这样，不到两月，海带又茁壮生长起来，八十三筏占了近三十亩海面，每亩收获量达到了二十吨左右，在大面积上超过了去年自己创造的全国最高纪录。更喜人的是“海带王”诞生了，有几根足有六米长，五十厘米宽，黑黝黝的，一个人拿不起来。人们说，它有资格进展览馆了！
  赶潮流　忙加工
    海带很娇，水温高过十五度便会腐烂；雨点打过，也会留下一个个白点。所以天一暖，必须突击收割，突击加工。现在旅大市许多工厂、机关、部队都抽调了大量人力、物力支援水产工人赶收、赶运、赶加工。最近这里是晚上上潮，为了赶潮流，好向岸上运海带，每当月色蒙胧的时候，百里海沿，万船齐发，热闹非常。陆地上更是紧张，有的抬筐猛跑，有的推车紧追，把船上卸下的海带运到腌池里，撒上盐，以免腐烂。这样每天都能收割和加工一二千吨海带。在晴朗的日子，妇女们便把海带一棵棵摆在烫人的沙滩上晒干，以便打包装车，运往外地，供应市场。而海带根则被割下来，送到加工厂里，制造碘等多种化工产品。（附图片）
