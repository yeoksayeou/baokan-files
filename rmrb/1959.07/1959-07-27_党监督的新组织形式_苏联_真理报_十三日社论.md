A new great task raised by the 21st Congress of the CPSU, namely, comprehensively unfolding the construction of a communist society in our country, can only be successfully completed under the conditions of further developing socialist democracy, further promoting the creative initiative and pioneering spirit of the broad masses of people, and more actively absorbing social organizations and all working people to participate in the management of state affairs and in economic and cultural construction. For this, party organizations must carry out inner-party democracy, enhance the enthusiasm of party members, and improve the role and responsibility of party organizations in realizing national plans.

Expanding the role of grassroots party organizations is particularly important, because the responsibility of grassroots party organizations is to guide the masses to achieve specific tasks in developing production.

The CPSU Party Constitution stipulates that grassroots party organizations in production and trade enterprises have the right to supervise administrative management activities. This right makes party organizations bear great responsibility for the situation in production and gives them powerful weapons to overcome shortcomings in enterprises and collective farms and improve their work.

However, the CPSU Party Constitution does not clearly stipulate what aspects the supervision of administrative management activities should include. Therefore, many grassroots party organizations have not fully utilized their supervisory powers in this regard. In practice, the realization of party supervision mainly involves listening to reports by economic leaders on the implementation of production plans. As a result, the business operations of enterprises are often not studied deeply enough, and the following important issues are often not paid attention to by party organizations: for example, complying with state laws and discipline, completing product supply tasks on time and with quality, fighting against departmentalism, and many other important issues in the work of enterprises.

The measures taken by the Party to reorganize the management of industry and construction and to expand the rights of the Soviet organs of the various republics and local areas have provided enormous possibilities for further developing production. The activities of industrial enterprises have been greatly improved. However, as Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his speech at the June Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, some economic and enterprise leaders have undermined the Leninist principle of democratic centralism in economic construction. Some leaders of the National Economic Council and enterprises have also failed to complete plans and tasks for supplying industrial products to other enterprises, economic administrative regions, and the entire country on time. This has caused losses to the national economy.

The existence of departmentalism proves that the supervision by some party organizations over the timely completion of product supply plans and the strict observance of state discipline is very weak. Of course, this should not be allowed under any circumstances. It is now necessary to improve party supervision so that the organizational form of this supervision can fully meet the smooth resolution of the new historical tasks put forward by the 21st Congress of the CPSU and ensure that the broad masses of party and non-party members are absorbed into the work of party supervision.

In order to strengthen the supervision of administrative management activities, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that it is appropriate to establish committees in the grassroots party organizations of industrial, transportation, and construction enterprises, trade enterprises, design organizations and design bureaus, as well as scientific research institutes that undertake enterprise and construction site orders. These committees should be composed of party members and probationary party members to exercise the right of party organizations to supervise administrative management activities. The task of the committee is to ensure constant supervision of whether the enterprise is completing production tasks, state orders, and supplying various high-quality products on time. The committee should supervise all staff of the enterprise and make them abide by state discipline and fight against localism and departmentalism.

The committee is not a special supervisory agency parallel to the party organization. They are one of the organizational forms through which the grassroots party organization realizes the supervision of administrative management activities. The entire work of the committee is carried out under the leadership of the party committee, the standing body of the party, and the secretary of the grassroots party organization.

The regulations on the various committees formulated by the Central Committee of the CPSU stipulate that the establishment of these committees is determined by the party organization according to the nature of production. For example, the following committees can be established: committees to supervise the completion of state orders and the coordinated supply and transportation to other enterprises and economic administrative regions; committees to supervise the completion of special, specialized, and export supply; committees to supervise product quality; committees to supervise the reduction of building construction costs and the improvement of quality; committees to supervise the rational utilization of transportation equipment and the implementation of plans for the adoption of new technologies and the mechanization and automation of production processes.

Party organizations of trade enterprises and public catering industries can set up committees to supervise the continuous delivery of goods, supervise the implementation of Soviet trade regulations, and supervise the reduction of turnover and production costs.

However, this does not mean that the grassroots party organizations of production and trade enterprises cannot establish committees to supervise other issues when necessary, based on local conditions and the importance of the tasks to be completed by the enterprise, workshop, group, and specialized institution. On the contrary, every such grassroots party organization has broad possibilities to express initiative and spontaneity.

It is important that at the beginning of the work of each committee, the party organization should instill in this committee a high degree of organization and a spirit of seeking truth from facts, ensuring that the entire organization of these committees and their individual members have creative initiative, and pay attention to preventing the activities of the committees from becoming mere lip service. The committees should carefully study the situation in the posts they directly supervise. Once any shortcomings are found in the work of the enterprise, workshop, group, and specialized institution, the results of the investigation should be immediately reported to the party committee, the standing body of the party, and the party meeting, as well as the economic leading organs, and measures should be taken together with them to eliminate the shortcomings.

If the economic leading organs fail to correct the shortcomings found by the committee in a timely manner, the party committee, the standing body of the party, or the party meeting, in fulfilling the right to supervise economic work given to the party organization, should discuss this issue and take measures against the economic leading organs, bringing into play the role of the party. If the above measures are ineffective, the party organization can request assistance from the party organizations and Soviet organs of the district, city, state, and republic, as well as the National Economic Council of the economic administrative region. If these leading organs do not take the necessary measures according to the reminder of the grassroots party organization, the grassroots party organization can report the matter to the Central Committee of the CPSU or the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

Correctly arranging the work of the committee inevitably requires carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the enterprise in depth. This enables party organizations and economic organizations to expose shortcomings in a timely manner and find ways to quickly complete national plans and tasks. It is not difficult to imagine how much fresh blood they will inject into the work of the enterprise if the broad activists among the working people can be constantly attracted to realize social supervision. In particular, it will have a good influence if people truly believe that someone is listening to their criticism, valuing their criticism, and believing that someone is studying and implementing their suggestions.

The regulations of the committee stipulate that each committee has the right to submit issues concerning the improvement of the work of workshops, factories, enterprises, and research institutes to the workers' congress for discussion through the party committee or the branch committee of the grassroots party organization, in order to mobilize all personnel to overcome shortcomings, and can also raise individual issues at its own meetings for preliminary study and formulation of various suggestions. The committee has the responsibility to make unremitting efforts to ensure that the issues they raise are thoroughly resolved.

It is very important to establish practical contact and correct mutual relations with the administrative leaders of the enterprise in the work of the supervisory committee. When the committee inspects the production situation, it cannot and should not revoke or make any administrative instructions, as this would undermine the principle of one-man leadership. At the same time, economic leaders have the obligation to do their best to help the committee, provide them with the necessary materials to understand the issues they are concerned about, objectively report the situation, study the committee's suggestions without delay, and take timely measures to overcome the shortcomings they expose.

Now, the establishment of administrative management supervision committees has begun within party organizations. Party committees and the standing bodies of the party are required to carefully and conscientiously consider and resolve the issue of what kind of committees should be established in their organizations. Party workers, experts, and staff who are well-trained, principled, strong and active, and capable of truly supervising the implementation of the Party's instructions should be selected into the committee.

The number of committee members and cadre staffing should be determined according to the scope and nature of the work, and elected by open ballot at the general meeting of party members or the congress of party representatives of the grassroots party organization for a term of one year. In the future, they will be re-elected at the periodic summary report meetings and elections of party organs.

A one-size-fits-all approach is not allowed when establishing committees. In grassroots party organizations with a small number of people, the question of whether it is appropriate to establish a committee can be resolved according to the decision of the general meeting of party members. In places where it is considered unnecessary to establish a committee, all party members can realize supervision of economic activities under the leadership of the secretary of the grassroots party organization. In enterprises where there is no grassroots party organization, the trade union and Communist Youth League organizations should play a supervisory role and report violations of state discipline to the party organs, as stipulated in the relevant regulations on trade union work and the regulations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on Communist Youth League work.

Some people believe that the current other forms of social supervision that have been proven to be correct in the grassroots party organizations of production enterprises and commercial enterprises—listening to reports from economic leaders at party meetings, regularly active production meetings, mass production committees of trade union committees, Communist Youth League supervision posts, spot check teams, etc.—have lost their own role and should be abolished due to the establishment of committees in the grassroots party organizations of production enterprises and commercial enterprises. This view is incorrect. On the contrary, party organizations have the responsibility to ensure the unity and coordination between the form of party supervision and the form of social supervision, prevent various redundant and overlapping inspections, and avoid unnecessary disturbance to economic management organs.

The newspaper should play a major role in the work of the committee and the various work of the grassroots party organization. It should constantly explain the work experience of the various committees directly under the grassroots party organization in supervising the economic work of administrative organs, and give various support to the committee.

The most important task of local party organizations is to ensure the leadership and assistance in the composition of the committee, correctly guide their work, constantly summarize and promote the work experience of the committee, and supervise the leaders of enterprises, National Economic Councils, and other Soviet and economic organizations to immediately correct the shortcomings that have been exposed. Various forms and methods should be widely used to mobilize the masses to implement the historically significant resolutions made by the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the resolutions of the June Central Plenary Session of the CPSU.

    党监督的新组织形式
    苏联“真理报”十三日社论
    苏共第二十一次代表大会提出的在我国全面展开共产主义社会建设的新的伟大任务，只有在这样的条件下才能胜利地完成，即：进一步发展社会主义民主、进一步发挥广大人民群众创造性的主动精神和首创精神，更加积极地吸收社会团体和全体劳动人民参加管理国家事务、参加经济和文化建设。为此党组织必须开展党内民主，提高党员群众的积极性，提高党组织在实现国家计划方面的作用和责任感。
    扩大基层党组织的作用特别重要，因为基层党组织的责任就是引导群众去实现发展生产的具体任务。
    苏共党章规定生产企业和贸易企业的基层党组织有权监督行政管理活动。这个权利使党组织对生产中的情况负有巨大的责任，并赋予它以有力的武器来克服企业、集体农庄中的缺点和改进它们的工作。
    但是苏共党章中并没有明确规定，对行政管理活动的监督应该包括哪些方面，因此许多基层党组织在这方面没有充分利用给予它们的监督权。实际上，党的监督的实现主要就是听取经济领导人所作的关于执行生产计划情况的报告。因而对企业的业务情况往往研究得不深不透，而且，下列一些重要的问题往往没有受到党组织的注意：例如，遵守国家法律和纪律按时、保质地完成产品供应任务，同本位主义现象作斗争，以及企业工作中其他许多重要的问题。
    党实行的改组工业和建筑业管理和扩大各加盟共和国和地方苏维埃机关权利的措施，为进一步发展生产提供了巨大的可能性。工业企业的活动大大改进了。但是，正如赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党中央委员会六月全会的发言中所指出的，某些经济和企业的领导人，在经济建设方面破坏了列宁主义的民主集中制原则。国民经济委员会和企业的某些领导者也没有按时完成向其他企业、经济行政区以及全国供应工业产品的计划和任务。这给国民经济造成了损失。
    本位主义现象的存在证明，某些党组织对按期完成产品供应计划和严格遵守国家纪律方面的监督是很薄弱的。当然，无论如何都是不允许这样做的。现在必须改善党的监督，使这种监督的组织形式完全能够满足苏共第二十一次代表大会提出的新的历史任务的顺利解决和保证把广大党和非党群众吸收到党的监督工作中来。
    为了加强对行政管理活动的监督，苏联共产党中央委员会认为，在工业、运输业、建筑业企业、贸易企业、设计组织和设计局，以及承担企业和建筑工地订货的科学研究所的党的基层组织中建立委员会是适宜的，这个委员会应由一些党员和预备党员组成，以运用党组织对行政管理活动进行监督的权利。委员会的任务是对企业是否及时完成生产任务、国家订货和供应各种优质产品保证经常的监督。委员会应该监督企业的全体工作人员，让他们遵守国家纪律，同地方主义和本位主义现象进行斗争。
    委员会并不是与党组织平行的某种特殊的监督机构。它们是基层党组织借以实现对行政管理活动进行监督的组织形式之一。委员会的整个工作是在党委会、党的常务机构和基层党组织的书记的领导下进行。
    在苏共中央委员会制定的关于各个委员会的条例中规定，这些委员会的设立由党组织根据生产性质决定，比如，可以设立这样一些委员会：对完成国家订货和完成向其他企业及经济行政区的协作供运实行监督、对完成特殊、专门和出口供运实行监督、对产品质量实行监督的委员会；对降低建筑物工程造价和提高质量实行监督、对合理利用运输的技术工具、对采用新技术、使生产过程机械化和自动化计划执行情况实行监督的委员会。
    贸易企业和公共饮食业的党组织可以设立一些委员会来监督不间断地运入商品，监督苏联贸易规章执行情况以及监督减少周转和生产费用的情况。
    但是，这并不意味着生产和贸易企业的基层党组织不能够在必要时根据当地的条件和该企业、车间、团体和专门机构应完成的任务的重要性设立监督其他问题的委员会。相反地，每一个这样的基层党组织都有广泛的可能表现主动、自动的精神。
    重要的是，党组织在各委员会工作一开始的时候，就要使这个委员会贯穿着高度的组织性和实事求是的精神，保证这些委员会的整个组织和它们的个别成员都有创造积极性，注意使委员会的活动不致于变成纸上谈兵。各委员会应当认真研究它们直接监督的那些岗位的情况。一旦发现企业、车间、团体和专门机构的工作有什么缺点，就立即把调查结果报告给党委会、党的常务机构和党的会议以及经济领导机构，并同它们一道采取措施来消除缺点。
    如果经济领导机关不能及时纠正委员会所查出的缺点，则党委会、党的常务机构或党的会议在履行党组织所给予的监督经济工作的权利时，应当讨论这一问题，对经济领导机关采取措施，发挥党的作用。如果上述措施无效，则党组织可以请求区、市、州和共和国的党组织和苏维埃机构，以及经济行政区的国民经济委员会给予协助。如果这些领导机关不按照基层党组织的提醒采取应有的措施，则基层党组织可以将此事报告给苏共中央委员会或苏联部长会议。
    正确地安排委员会的工作必然要求在企业中深入开展批评与自我批评。这就使党组织和经济组织能及时揭发缺点，找到迅速完成国家计划和任务的途径。不难设想，如果能经常地吸引劳动人民中广大积极分子来实现社会监督，他们将给企业的工作输入多么新鲜的血液。特别是，如果人们真正相信有人在听取他们的批评，重视他们的批评，并且相信有人在研究和实现他们的建议，这将起良好的影响。
    委员会的条例规定，各委员会有权通过党委会或基层党组织的支委会把关于改善车间、工厂、企业、研究所工作的问题提交职工会议讨论，以便动员全体人员来克服缺点，也可以把个别问题提到自己的会议来，以便初步研究和拟定各种建议。委员会有责任作不懈的努力，使他们所提出的问题得到彻底的解决。
    非常重要的是，要使监督委员会在自己的工作中同企业的行政领导建立实际接触和正确的相互关系。委员会在检查生产情况的时候，它不能够、也不应当撤消或提出任何的行政指示，因为这样将会破坏一长制原则。同时，经济领导人员有义务尽力帮助委员会，向他们提供为了解他们所关心的问题的必要材料，客观地报道情况，不拖延地研究委员会的建议，及时采取措施克服它们所揭发的缺点。
    现在，在党组织内已着手成立行政管理监督委员会。要求党委会和党的常务机构仔细认真地考虑和解决关于在本组织中应该成立一些什么样的委员会的问题。应该把那些受过良好训练的、有原则性的，坚强和积极的、能够对执行党的指示进行真正监督的党员工人、专家和职员选入委员会。
    委员会成员的数目和干部配备应该根据工作的范围和性质来决定，并在基层党组织的党员大会上或党代表会议上用公开投票的形式选举产生，任期为一年。今后它们将在党机构的定期总结报告会和选举会上重新改选。
    在建立委员会时不许采取千篇一律的办法。在人数较少的基层党组织中，关于建立委员会是否合宜的问题可以根据党员大会的决定来解决。在那些认为没有必要建立委员会的地方可由全体党员在基层党组织书记的领导下实现对经济活动的监督。在那些没有基层党组织的企业中，工会和共青团组织应该起监督作用并向党的机构报告违反国家纪律的行为，这是有关工会工作的相应条例以及苏联共产党关于共青团工作方面的章程所规定的。
    有人认为，由于在生产企业和商业企业的基层党组织中建立了委员会，在党组织、工会组织和共青团组织中现行的、被证明是正确的其他社会监督形式——在党的会议上听取经济领导人的报告、经常活动的生产会议、工会委员会的群众性生产委员会、共青团监督岗、抽查队等都失去了本身的作用并且应当取消，这种看法是不正确的。与此相反，党组织有责任保证党的监督形式和社会监督形式之间的统一和步调一致，防止各种多余和重叠的检查以及给经济管理机构以不必要的打扰。
    报纸应当在委员会、基层党组织的各种工作中起重大的作用。它应当不断阐明直属基层党组织的各委员会在监督行政机构经济工作方面的工作经验，给委员会以各种支持。
    地方党组织最重要的任务是，保证领导和帮助委员会的组成，正确指导它们的工作，经常总结和推广委员会的工作经验，监督各企业、国民经济委员会以及其他苏维埃和经济组织领导人立即纠正所揭发的缺点。应当广泛利用各种形式和方法来动员群众去贯彻苏共第二十一次代表大会作出的具有历史意义的决议和苏共六月中央全会的决议。
