Adopt Diverse Forms to Organize Teacher Training
Yang Gong, Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Jiangsu Normal College

Continuously cultivating and improving the level of teachers is a fundamental key to improving teaching quality and a basic construction task of the school. From the perspective of our college's current tasks, vigorously cultivating and improving existing teachers is an even more urgent task. 1958 was a year of great development for our college. The student-teacher ratio dropped from one to eight in 1957 to one to twelve, and the teaching tasks were heavy. Next academic year, the increase in the number of students in our college will exceed last year, and the number of teachers cannot increase accordingly. The student-teacher ratio will be even larger, so the shortage of teachers will be even more prominent. In order to solve the contradiction of insufficient teachers, we will have to take some necessary measures, such as: student class sizes will have to be larger, teachers' teaching hours will have to be more, and young teaching assistants who have recently graduated from universities will have to step onto the podium in large numbers, and so on. Under these circumstances, how to ensure and continuously improve our teaching quality is a serious task facing us.

There are two ways to solve this contradiction: one is to wait for the higher authorities to allocate enough teachers for us, which is unrealistic. If the waiting mentality prevails, it will only bring us more difficulties and passivity. The other way is to actively take measures, use all effective forms, mobilize all favorable factors, and universally improve the professional and teaching level of existing teachers—especially young teachers. From the experience we have already explored, this is the most reliable way to improve teaching quality while the teaching tasks are very heavy.

Since the beginning of this semester, under the leadership of the Party Committee, all teachers of our college have discussed the issue of teachers and determined the principle of self-reliance. In order to further improve teaching quality and meet the development tasks of the next academic year, senior teachers are willing to use all their knowledge to equip young teachers, and young teachers also express their determination to overcome all difficulties, learn humbly, and improve their professional level. Various departments have successively carried out the work of cultivating and improving teachers. From the perspective of the past four months since the beginning of the semester, the development of this work is not only a matter of universally improving the professional level of teachers, but also a matter of further improving the ideological awareness of teachers, establishing new relationships between teachers, and promoting greater unity and cooperation among teachers.

In the work of cultivating teachers, the first thing we solve is: what is the direction of improvement for each teacher? What basis is used to determine each person's advanced study subjects? Is it arranged according to the teaching tasks of each department combined with each person's situation, or is it up to each person to choose freely? In the past, some teachers often only relied on personal interests and ignored teaching needs when dealing with personal advanced studies. This is the relationship between personal advanced studies and teaching tasks. All departments of our college have made comprehensive arrangements in accordance with the tasks stipulated in the education plan. Not only the current and next academic year's teaching tasks are taken into account, but also the needs of two or three years later are considered, so that the teacher training and teaching tasks can be closely aligned. After the mathematics department arranged the teachers according to the four-year teaching tasks, they selected the teachers with the highest professional level and the richest teaching experience to teach the first-year courses, and then followed up with the second-year, third-year, and fourth-year courses year by year. Through the activities of the teaching group, each time a grade's course is taught, a batch of apprentices are brought along. Since the beginning of last semester, this method has been adopted for courses such as elementary algebra, elementary functions, and analytic geometry in the first year. The implementation results show that it not only cultivates and improves teachers, but also improves teaching quality. It is expected that within four years, not only will a set of competent professional teachers be formed, but also a complete set of professional teaching materials will be formed.

The formulation of the teacher training and advanced study plan of the Physics Department of our college is first based on the teachers' suggestions for the subjects they need to study according to the teaching tasks of the department; at the same time, according to their own expertise, they put forward in which aspects they can help others to study; and then, according to the teaching tasks of the department, a comprehensive study is conducted to determine each person's advanced study subjects and guidance teachers, link them up, organize advanced study groups, and formulate specific advanced study plans. Since the beginning of the semester, it has been adhered to and has never been interrupted. In this way, it not only guarantees the teaching tasks, but also takes care of the specific situation of the teachers, and closely integrates the training and improvement of teachers with the teaching tasks, incorporating them into an overall plan.

There are various forms of on-the-job training. A more common form is to bring apprentices while working. That is, teachers of the same teaching material and the same course are organized, equipped with experienced teachers as teaching backbones, or designated experienced teachers to be responsible for guiding new teachers. They lead young teachers to compile teaching materials, write lesson plans, and review the lesson preparation notes of young teachers. Senior teachers take the lead in teaching, and young teachers first listen to the senior teachers' lessons, analyze them after class, absorb experience, and put forward suggestions for improvement, and then the young teachers go to teach. Senior teachers also often listen to the lessons of young teachers to help them continuously improve their teaching. The method of bringing apprentices at work has received significant results. The Chinese Modern History and World Modern History of the History Department are both newly opened courses, but under the guidance of senior teachers, full cooperation between young and old has been implemented, basically guaranteeing the quality of lectures. The elementary algebra, elementary functions, analytic geometry of the mathematics department, and the various courses of the physics department all use their own newly compiled teaching materials. Many young teachers, and even individual older teachers, are not sure about teaching. They have adopted the method of bringing apprentices at work, which has effectively guaranteed the teaching quality. The content of the elementary algebra and elementary functions courses, whether in terms of depth or breadth, exceeds the past. Before the class, everyone said that the content was too deep, the teaching materials were difficult to master, they were afraid that they would not be able to teach well, and they were afraid that the students would not be able to accept it; however, because everyone had participated in the discussion of compiling teaching materials beforehand, and listened to Professor Zhang Bokang's lesson before the class, and then discussed it after class, the teachers who taught this course had increased confidence and taught very well, and the students' learning quality was also significantly improved.

In addition to bringing apprentices at work, on-the-job training also adopts some other methods according to the different professional foundations of each person: for teachers with poor professional foundations, teachers are assigned to give them supplementary basic courses; for those with relatively good professional foundations, they are required to improve a new course under the guidance of teachers with higher professional levels on the premise of doing a good job in teaching, and help them expand and deepen their professional knowledge; for teachers who already have considerable attainments in their majors, they are required to further improve themselves through scientific research and other methods.

In the work of cultivating teachers, it is not enough to rely solely on senior teachers to cultivate young teachers. In view of the fact that the professional foundations of new and old teachers are not balanced, each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, it is also necessary to fully tap the potential of teachers, give play to everyone's strengths, learn from each other, learn from the able, learn from others' strengths, and make up for one's own shortcomings, in order to achieve universal improvement in accordance with the principle of "the able are teachers." The Physics Department of our college arranged advanced studies according to this principle. Senior teachers not only guide young teachers to study, but also guide senior teachers to study; in addition to learning from senior teachers, young teachers also learn from other young teachers with expertise. The two young teachers who guided the two young teachers to study electrical and radio courses were the two young teachers; senior teachers are the main force in cultivating and improving teachers, but they can also apprentice to young teachers. Three senior teachers in the department had poor mathematical foundations, and the assistant teacher who graduated in 1956 was giving them remedial lessons. Professor Zhou Xiaoqian is one of the backbones of cultivating young teachers, but he and two other senior teachers were given lessons in experimental technology by young teacher Shen Leihong.

After implementing the principle of "the able are teachers," the relationship between teachers has also undergone great changes. In the past, some teachers often regarded learning from others as dishonorable. They knew that they were inferior to others in certain aspects, but they could not put down their airs and were unwilling to learn from others. They would rather secretly learn from others' strengths than condescend to openly learn from others' strengths. Even if they were willing to learn, others might not be willing to lend a helping hand. This situation was especially serious among senior teachers, who sealed themselves off and formed obstacles to progress. As for young teachers teaching senior teachers, it was even rarer. The breaking of this heavy obstacle opened up a new atmosphere of mutual learning, which also greatly promoted the close relationship between teachers and strengthened the unity among teachers. From the perspective of the school, the formation of this atmosphere will undoubtedly give students a good and far-reaching impact.

Whether the advanced study of teachers can be developed and done well? The decisive factor is ideological leadership. After last year's rectification campaign and the great revolution and great leap forward in education, the socialist consciousness and work enthusiasm of the teachers of our college have been unprecedentedly improved. Therefore, in dealing with the relationship between personal advanced studies and work needs, they can adhere to the principle of an overall plan; in dealing with the relationship between teachers, they can carry forward the spirit of unity and cooperation and mutual learning; for the needs of work, they can overcome all difficulties and carry out selfless labor. For example, Comrade Cai Mingzhi, a teacher in the Physics Department, teaches sixteen classes a week and also teaches three classes of elasticity mechanics to young teachers every week; many young teachers who have newly opened courses, although their professional knowledge and teaching experience are insufficient, they teach and learn at the same time with a tenacious fighting will, ensuring the teaching quality.

    采用多样形式　组织教师进修
    中共江苏师范学院委员会副书记　杨巩
    不断培养和提高教师水平，是提高教学质量的基本关键，也是学校的一项基本建设任务。从我院当前任务来看，大力培养和提高现有教师，更是一项迫不容缓的工作。1958年是我院大发展的一年，师生比例从1957年的一比八降为一比十二，教学任务是繁重的。下一学年我院学生数的增长将超过去年，教师人数不可能相适应的增长，师生的比例亦将拉得更大，因而师资紧张情况将更加突出。为了解决师资不足的矛盾，我们将不得不采取一些必要的措施，例如：学生编班不得不大些，教师的任课时数不得不多些，从高等学校毕业不久的青年助教不得不大批的走上讲台，等等。在这种情况下，如何使我们的教学质量得到保证并不断提高，这是摆在我们面前的严重任务。
    解决这个矛盾的办法，有两种：一种是等待上面给我们配足教师，这是不现实的。等待思想如果占了上风，只会给我们带来更多的困难和被动。另一种办法是积极采取措施，运用一切有效的形式，动员一切有利因素，普遍提高现有师资——特别是青年教师的专业水平和教学水平，从我们已摸索到的经验来看，这是在教学任务十分繁重的情况下，仍然能够提高教学质量的最可靠的办法。
    这学期开始，我院全体教师在党委的领导下，对师资问题进行了讨论，确定了自力更生的原则。为了进一步提高教学质量和迎接下学年的发展任务，老教师愿意把自己的全部知识用来武装青年教师，青年教师亦表示决心克服一切困难，虚心学习，提高自己的业务水平。各系科先后开展了培养和提高师资的工作。从开学以来四个多月的情况看，这一工作的展开，不仅仅是普遍提高教师业务水平的问题，同时也是进一步提高教师的思想觉悟，建立新的教师之间的关系，促使教师之间更进一步的团结合作的问题。
    在培养师资工作中，我们首先解决的是：每一个教师的提高方向是什么？根据什么来确定各人的进修科目？是根据各系科的教学任务再结合各人的情况来安排呢，还是听各人自由选择？过去有些教师对待个人进修，常常只凭个人兴趣，不顾教学需要，这是个人进修和教学任务的关系问题。我院各系科都按照教育计划所规定的任务，进行了通盘的安排。不仅考虑到当前的和下学年的教学任务，同时也考虑了两三年后的需要，考虑到教师进修和教学任务能紧紧对上口径。数学系根据四年的教学任务排定了教师以后，即选择了专业水平最高、教学经验最丰富的教师，上一年级的课程，然后二年级、三年级、四年级逐年跟上去，通过教学小组的活动，每上一个年级的课，就带一批徒弟。从上学期开始，一年级的初级代数、初级函数、解析几何等课程，已经采用了这个办法，实行的结果，既培养提高了教师，也提高了教学质量。预计在四年内，不仅将形成一套足以胜任的专业教师队伍，而且也将形成一整套的专业教材。
    我院物理系教师培养进修计划的制定，是先由教师根据系的教学任务，提出自己需要进修的科目；同时也根据自己的专长，提出在那些方面可以帮助别人进修；然后再根据系的教学任务，进行综合研究，确定各人的进修科目和指导教师，挂好钩，组织进修小组，制定具体进修计划。开学以来，坚持执行，从无间断。这样，既保证了教学任务，又照顾了教师的具体情况，把教师的培养提高和教学任务紧密结合，纳入一盘棋。
    在职进修的形式是多种多样的，比较普遍的一种形式是在工作中带徒弟。即把同教材、同课程的教师组织起来，配上有经验的教师作为教学骨干，或指定有经验的教师负责指导新开课的教师。他们领导青年教师编教材、写教案，审查青年教师的备课笔记。老教师上课走前一步，青年教师先听老教师的课，课后进行分析，吸取经验，提出改进意见，然后青年教师再去上课。老教师也经常听青年教师的课，帮助他们不断改进教学。工作中带徒弟的办法，已收到显著效果。历史系的中国现代史和世界现代史都是新开的课程，但是，在老教师指导下，充分实行了青老合作，基本上保证了讲授质量。数学系的初级代数、初级函数、解析几何以及物理系的各门课程，都是使用自己新编的教材，许多青年教师，甚至个别老年教师对上课没有把握，他们采用了工作中带徒弟的办法，使教学质量得到了切实的保证。初级代数、初级函数这门课的内容，无论从深度、广度来说，都超过过去，上课前大家都说内容深了，教材难掌握，怕自己讲不好，怕学生接受不了；但是，由于事前大家都参加过编教材的讨论，在上课前又先听了张伯康教授的课，课后又进行了讨论，结果讲这门课的教师信心提高了，都讲得很好，学生的学习质量也显著提高。
    在职进修除工作中带徒弟外，还根据各人业务基础的不同，采用了一些其他的办法：对业务基础差的教师，就指定教师给他们补基础课程；对业务基础尚好的，就要求他们在搞好教学工作的前提下，指定专业水平较高的教师，指导他们进修一门新课，帮助他们扩大和加深专业知识；对本专业已具备相当修养的教师，则要求他们通过科学研究以及其他办法进一步提高。
    在培养教师的工作中，仅仅依靠老教师培养青年教师还是不够的。鉴于新老教师中的业务基础并不平衡，各有专攻，各有所缺，因此，还必须根据能者为师的原则，充分挖掘教师潜力，发挥每个人的专长，互相学习，向能者学习，取长补短，以达到普遍提高的目的。我院物理系就是根据这个原则安排进修的。老教师不仅指导青年教师进修，也指导老教师进修；青年教师除向老教师学习外，也向另一些有专长的青年教师学习，指导二个青年教师进修电工无线电课程的，就是两个青年教师；老教师是培养提高师资的主要力量，但是他们也可以拜青年教师做师傅，该系有三位老教师数学基础差，为他们补课的是一位1956年毕业的助教，周孝谦教授是培养青年教师的骨干之一，但他和另两位老教师，在实验技术方面，是由青年教师沈雷洪给他们上课的。
    实行能者为师的原则以后，也使教师之间的关系发生了很大的变化。在过去，往往有些教师把向别人学习看作不光彩的事情，明知道自己在某方面不及别人，却放不下架子，不愿跟别人学习，宁可偷偷地学习别人的长处，却不屑公开地学习别人的长处。即使愿意学习，而别人也未必愿意伸出援助的手。这种情况在老教师中尤为严重，自己封锁自己，形成进步的障碍。至于青年教师为老年教师上课，更是罕见。这重障碍的打破，便开了一个互相学习的新风气，这对密切教师之间的关系，加强教师间的团结，也有很大的促进作用。从学校来说，这种风气的形成，无疑地还将给学生以良好的深远的影响。
  师资的进修工作是否展得开、搞得好？决定的因素是思想挂帅。我院经过去年的整风和教育大革命、大跃进，教师们的社会主义觉悟和工作积极性空前提高，因而在处理个人进修与工作需要的关系上，能坚持一盘棋原则；在处理教师之间的关系上，能发扬团结合作、互相学习的精神；为了工作的需要，他们能够克服一切困难，进行忘我的劳动，例如物理系教师蔡铭之同志，每周担任十六节课，还为青年教师每周上三节弹性力学；许多新开课的青年教师，虽然专业知识、教学经验是不足的，但是他们以顽强的战斗意志，边教边学，保证了教学质量。
