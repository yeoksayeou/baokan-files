Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 23rd. The staff and workers in the forest areas of the Greater Khingan Mountains, Lesser Khingan Mountains, and Wanda Mountains in Heilongjiang Province are seizing the opportunity and doing everything possible to increase the production of mine props. By the beginning of July, they had produced one million cubic meters of mine props to support coal mine production in and outside the province.

In the Greater Khingan Mountains, Lesser Khingan Mountains, and Wanda Mountains forest areas, most trees are over twenty or thirty centimeters in diameter, with fewer small-diameter trees, leading to a shortage of mine prop resources. In response, many forestry bureaus have adopted the method of "setting up checkpoints at all levels and opening up sources in many ways" to increase and expand the sources of mine prop production. Staff and workers at the Huanan Forestry Bureau put forward the slogan "Everyone works hard on and off the mountains, and no mine prop is discarded," mobilizing logging workers to tightly control the logging process and fully utilize large branches and small-diameter trees suitable for use as mine props. At the same time, they launched a "picking up mine props" campaign throughout the bureau, transporting abandoned logs, tree tops, large branches, and so on, that had been left on the mountains for many years to the bottom of the mountains to be made into mine prop materials. Since the sixteen forestry bureaus in the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area launched a large-scale mine prop picking campaign, they have achieved great results, with the total amount of mine props picked up in the first half of the year reaching more than 6,600 cubic meters.

In the first six months of this year, all forestry bureaus in the province, while actively increasing mine prop production, also focused closely on the transportation of mine props. From January to June, the province transported 983,000 cubic meters of mine props to mining areas such as Hegang, Jixi, Kailuan, and Fuxin. (Wang Baoxin)

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Dispatch: Reporter Tang Tianzhen reports: The consumption of pit props in Huainan Coal Mines is constantly decreasing. The pit prop consumption per thousand tons of coal in the whole mine decreased by 4.2% in the first half of this year compared with the plan, and 10.7% compared with the same period last year. In the first half of July, it decreased by 3.42% compared with the actual consumption in the first half of the year. In the first half of the year, the whole mine saved a total of 6,492 cubic meters of pit props, which can be used to mine more than 264,000 tons of coal.

Pit props are the main material for coal mine production. Since the beginning of this year, Huainan Coal Mine has vigorously reformed the coal mining methods, thus ensuring the reduction of pit prop consumption. The main coal mining methods are "hydraulic coal mining," "shelter support," and "shallow mining multi-cycle operation."

Huainan mines have further established and improved the pit prop management organizations, strengthened the leadership in saving pit props, and transferred a group of technical workers to strengthen the pillar return teams. Each coal mining team and shift also set up worker pit prop managers to absorb workers into pit prop management. The strict implementation of these systems has powerfully guaranteed the reduction of pit prop consumption.

While strengthening management, Huainan Coal Mine also adopted various forms to conduct ideological education on saving pit props for employees, explaining to workers that "every bamboo and every piece of wood is hard-won," and mobilizing workers to calculate the waste of pit props, so that workers realize the importance of saving pit props. After the staff and workers of the coal mining area of Xiejiajji No. 3 Mine established the idea that everyone cherishes pit props, they conscientiously ensured that pit props were returned, used up, and transported cleanly, so that the recovery rate of pit props remained above 90%, and the reuse rate of pit props also stabilized above 85%.

    林区开源产矿柱  井下节流省坑木
    黑龙江林区增产矿柱办法多　淮南煤矿节约坑木成绩显著
    本报哈尔滨23日电　黑龙江省的大、小兴安岭、完达山林区职工，抓紧时机，千方百计增产矿柱，到7月上旬止已经生产一百万立方米矿柱，支援了省内外煤矿生产。
    大、小兴安岭和完达山脉林区，绝大部分树木直径都在二、三十公分以上，小径木较少，矿柱资源缺乏。许多林业局针对这一情况，采取了“层层设卡，多方开源”的办法，增加和扩大矿柱生产的来源。桦南林业局职工提出“山上山下齐努力，一棵矿柱不丢弃”的口号，发动造材工人，紧紧控制住造材工序，把适于作矿柱的大枝桠和小径木全部利用起来。同时在全局开展了一个“拣矿柱”活动，把弃置在山上多年的径木、梢头、大枝桠等全部运下山来造成矿柱材。小兴安岭林区十六个林业局开展大拣矿柱活动以来收到很大效果，上半年拣到的矿柱总量达六千六百多立方米。
    在今年头六个月中，全省各林业局在积极增加矿柱生产的同时，还狠抓、紧抓矿柱的运输工作。1至6月份全省运往鹤岗、鸡西、开滦、阜新等矿区的矿柱达九十八万三千立方米。　（王宝馨）
    据新华社合肥讯　记者汤天真报道：淮南煤矿的坑木消耗不断下降。全矿每千吨煤的坑木消耗，今年上半年比计划降低了4.2％，比去年同期降低了10.7％；7月上半月，又比上半年实际消耗量降低了3.42％。上半年，全矿共节约坑木六千四百九十二立方米，这些坑木可以用来开采二十六万四千多吨煤。
    坑木是煤矿生产的主要材料。今年以来，淮南煤矿大力改革了采煤方法，因而保证了坑木消耗的降低。这些采煤法主要的有“水力采煤”、“掩护支架”和“浅采多循环作业”等。
    淮南各矿都进一步建立和健全了坑木的管理组织，加强了对节约坑木的领导，并抽调了一批技术工人充实了回柱组。各个采煤队和班也都设立工人坑木管理员，吸收工人参加坑木管理。这些制度的严格执行，都有力地保证了坑木消耗的降低。
    在加强管理的同时，淮南煤矿还采取各种形式向职工进行节约坑木的思想教育。向工人说明“一竹一木来之不易”，并且发动工人算浪费坑木的账，使工人们认识到节约坑木的重要意义。谢家集三矿采煤一区的职工树立起人人爱惜坑木的思想以后，切实做到了把坑木回净、用净和运净，使坑木的回收率保持在90％以上，坑木的复用率也稳定在85％以上。
