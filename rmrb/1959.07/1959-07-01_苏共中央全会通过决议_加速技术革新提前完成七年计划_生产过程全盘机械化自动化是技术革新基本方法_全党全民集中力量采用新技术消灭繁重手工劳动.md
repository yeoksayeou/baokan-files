Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th Dispatch from TASS: Moscow newspapers today published the resolution passed at yesterday's closing session of the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session: "On the Work of Party Organizations, Soviet Organizations, and National Economic Councils in Implementing the Resolution of the 21st CPSU Congress on Accelerating Technological Innovation in Industry and Construction."

The CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session pointed out in the resolution that in the period since the 20th CPSU Congress (1956), the Soviet Union has made another major step forward in the development and technological innovation of various sectors of the national economy.

During this period, we have created and mass-produced more than five thousand new types of machines, machinery, equipment, and instruments, and have formulated and widely adopted advanced technological processes in industry and construction. The level of mechanization, especially the mechanization of heavy manual labor, has greatly improved. The automation of many production operations has been realized in industry, construction, and transportation.

The resolution pointed out that the National Economic Councils have done a great deal of work in completing the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan and further improving the technical production level of the main sectors of the national economy.

The resolution emphasized that the tremendous achievements in the development of the Soviet economy prove that the establishment of the National Economic Councils is a genuine revolutionary measure to improve the management of industry and construction.

The achievements in industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture prove that the entire Soviet people regard the Seven-Year Plan as their own cause and are tenaciously fighting for the victorious completion of the Seven-Year Plan.

The resolution said that the Soviet Union's achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy and jet aircraft, in launching the first artificial earth satellites and the first cosmic rocket in human history, clearly demonstrate to the world how high a level the people have reached in science and technology during the era of Soviet power.

The resolution said that due to the consistent implementation of the 20th Party Congress's resolution on technological innovation and the reorganization of the management of industry and construction, and due to the attention paid by the Party and economic organizations to the adoption of new technologies, new achievements have been made in the technological improvement of industry and construction.

The resolution emphasized that the Soviet Union has all the necessary conditions to smoothly implement the planned plan to further improve the technical level of production. The plenary session believes that the main thing at present is to raise the level of organizational work and the leadership of the Party and economic organizations over the work of adopting advanced technologies to the level of completing the new tasks.

The Central Committee plenary session reminded that some leaders only want to increase output in the research and adoption of new technologies, while neglecting the important goals: improving productivity, reducing workers' labor, improving quality, and reducing product costs.

The plenary session believes that the shortcomings in the adoption of new technologies are largely due to the conservatism of some economic workers and engineering and technical personnel in technology, their habit of using old production methods and labor tools, and the unwillingness of many economic leaders to overcome the difficulties encountered in the adoption of new technologies, and their lack of a national consideration in solving the problem of technological innovation in production.

The CPSU Central Committee plenary session believes that the main guideline in the work of the National Economic Councils is to carry out technological innovation in production, in order to improve productivity and reduce workers' labor, rapidly increase industrial production, improve the quality of industrial products and reduce costs, reduce construction costs and accelerate construction projects.

The resolution pointed out that the important task of creating and adopting new technologies of national significance is an organic component of the national economic plan. Measures to create and adopt new technologies should first of all have the guarantee of funding and material and technical resources.

The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee plenary session emphasized that an extremely important condition for the smooth completion of the Seven-Year Plan is to rebuild, expand, and technically re-equip existing enterprises, and to further technically equip construction organizations.

The CPSU Central Committee plenary session endorsed the initiative of the working people, Party organizations, and economic organizations of many states, Moscow, and Belarus, to seek all conditions for completing the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule by relying on better utilization of production capacity and rebuilding existing enterprises.

The resolution also stipulated the technological processes and improvements that should be widely adopted in various sectors of industry and transportation.

The resolution also stipulated measures to technically re-equip the construction industry and transportation industry, post and telecommunications industry, and measures to strengthen the design and testing base of the machine manufacturing industry.

The plenary session believes that the overall mechanization and automation of production processes is the basic method of technological innovation, without which it is impossible to further rapidly increase labor productivity. The plenary session decided to concentrate its efforts on solving the task put forward by the 21st CPSU Congress—to eliminate heavy manual labor in industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture on the basis of overall mechanization of production processes.

The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee plenary session cited many measures for implementing overall mechanization of the most arduous production processes. The plenary session believes that the implementation of these measures is a top priority and urgent matter.

In terms of automation, the CPSU Central Committee plenary session suggested focusing on practically solving the following tasks, namely, transitioning from the automation of partial production operations to the establishment of fully automated technological processes, fully automated workshops and enterprises, first of all in those sectors where automation can guarantee the greatest economic benefits.

The plenary session decided to formulate a plan for the adoption of radio-electronic technology in all sectors of the national economy.

A separate part of the resolution stipulated measures to further develop specialization and collaboration in the national economy.

The CPSU Central Committee plenary session instructed the State Planning Commission, the Councils of Ministers of the various Union Republics, and the various ministries and departments to formulate a plan for the development of specialization in industry and construction in 1959.

The resolution emphasized that it is necessary to enhance the role of science in technological innovation, improve the organization of scientific research work and experimental work, and accelerate the application of scientific achievements to production.

The plenary session believes that the most important task of all Soviet scientists is to closely connect with the practice of communist construction and further creatively develop science and technology.

The plenary session decided to formulate and implement measures to strengthen the material and technical foundation of scientific research institutes and institutions of higher learning. The competent authorities were instructed to submit to the Soviet Council of Ministers before the beginning of next year suggestions on the establishment of scientific research institutes directly under major enterprises, on the merger of certain scientific research institutes with institutions of higher learning, and on the merger of scientific organizations in the same profession.

The CPSU Central Committee plenary session decided that the main strength of Party organizations in industry, construction, and transportation should be concentrated on practically completing the tasks put forward by the 21st CPSU Congress in terms of technological innovation, and believes that this is a decisive condition for the smooth completion of the Seven-Year Plan.

The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee plenary session emphasized that at the current stage of communist construction, the struggle for technological innovation in all sectors of the national economy is a cause for the entire people, and requires all Party organizations, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations to carry out tremendous organizational work.

    苏共中央全会通过决议
    加速技术革新提前完成七年计划
    生产过程全盘机械化自动化是技术革新基本方法
    全党全民集中力量采用新技术消灭繁重手工劳动
    据新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科报纸今天登载了昨天苏共中央全会闭幕会议上所通过的决议：“关于党组织、苏维埃组织和国民经济委员会在执行苏共第二十一次代表大会关于加速工业和建筑业中技术革新的决议方面的工作”。
    苏共中央委员会全会在决议中指出，在党第二十次代表大会（1956年）之后的这段时间里，苏联在国民经济各部门的发展和技术革新方面又迈进了一大步。
    在这一时期内，我们创造了而且已经成批生产五千多种新型机器、机械、设备和仪器，在工业和建筑业中拟制并大规模地采用先进的工艺过程。机械化水平，特别是重体力劳动的机械化水平大大地提高了。在工业、建筑业和运输业中实现了许多生产操作的自动化。
    决议指出，国民经济委员会在完成七年计划任务和进一步提高国民经济主要部门技术生产水平方面，做了很大的工作。
    决议强调指出，苏联经济发展方面的巨大成就证明，成立国民经济委员会，是改进工业和建筑业管理形式方面的一次真正的革命措施。
    工业、建筑业、运输业和农业方面的成就证明，苏联全体人民把七年计划看作是自己切身的事业，并顽强地为胜利完成七年计划而斗争。
    决议说，苏联在和平利用原子能、喷气式飞机方面的成就，在人类历史上发射头几个人造地球卫星和第一个宇宙火箭，明确地向全世界表明，在苏维埃政权年代里，人民在科学技术方面达到了多么高的水平。
    决议说，由于始终如一地执行第二十次党代表大会关于技术革新、改组工业和建筑业管理的决议，由于党和经济组织重视采用新技术，在工业和建筑业的技术改进方面取得了新的成就。
    决议强调指出，苏联有着一切必要的条件，来顺利地执行所拟定的进一步提高生产技术水平的计划。全会认为，目前主要的是把组织工作，把党和经济组织对采用先进技术工作的领导水平提高到完成新任务的水平。
    中央全会提醒注意，某些领导人在研究和采用新技术方面只是想增加产量，而忽视重要的目的：提高生产率、减轻工人劳动、提高质量和降低产品成本。
    全会认为，在采用新技术方面所产生的缺点，在很大程度上是由于一部分经济工作人员和工程技术人员在技术上有保守主义，习惯于旧的生产方法和劳动工具，许多经济领导人不愿意克服在采用新技术方面所遇到的困难，对解决生产技术革新问题缺乏一种从国家出发的考虑。
    苏联共产党中央全会认为，国民经济委员会工作中的主要方针是进行生产技术革新，以便提高生产率和减轻工人劳动、迅速增加工业生产、改进工业产品质量和降低成本、减低建筑造价和加速建筑工程。
    决议指出，在创造和采用具有全国意义的新技术方面的重要工作任务是国民经济计划的有机组成部分。创造和采用新技术方面的措施，首先应该有拨款和物资技术资源的保证。
    苏共中央全会决议中强调指出，顺利完成七年计划的极为重要的条件是改建、扩大并在技术上重新装备现有的企业，进一步在技术上装备建筑机构。
    苏共中央全会赞同许多州、莫斯科和白俄罗斯的劳动人民、党组织和经济组织的倡议，即依靠更好地利用生产能力和改建现有企业的办法来寻求提前完成七年计划任务的一切条件。
    在决议中还规定了那些特别应该在工业和运输业各部门中广泛采用的工艺过程和改进办法。
    决议中还规定了在技术上重新装备建筑业和运输业、邮电业的措施，加强机器制造业的设计和试验基地的措施。
    全会认为，生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化是技术革新的基本方法，没有这种革新就不可能进一步高速提高劳动生产率。全会决定集中精力解决苏共二十一次代表大会所提出的任务——在生产过程全盘机械化的基础上，消灭工业、建筑业、运输业和农业中繁重的手工劳动。
    苏共中央全会决议中举出了许多最繁重的生产过程实行全盘机械化的措施。全会认为，实现这些措施是首要的迫切的事情。
    在自动化方面，苏共中央全会建议把主要精力集中于实际解决下列任务，即从部分生产操作的自动化过渡到建立完全自动化的工艺过程、完全自动化的车间和企业，首先是在那些自动化能保证最大经济效果的部门。
    全会决定制定在国民经济一切部门中采用无线电电子技术的计划。
    决议专有一部分规定进一步发展国民经济的专业化和协作的措施。
    苏共中央全会责成国家计划委员会、各加盟共和国部长会议、各个部和主管部门制订1959年在工业和建筑业中发展专业化的计划。
