Wine and Vinegar Ingredients Come From Many Sources

	Watermelon Rind Can Be Made Into Vinegar
	The joint state-private Yuci City Food Processing Plant in Shanxi Province uses watermelon rind to make vinegar. For every 100 jin of watermelon rind, add 12.5 jin of daqu (a type of fermentation starter), 20 jin of grain bran, and 4 jin of salt, which can produce 100 jin of 6-degree vinegar, equivalent to the vinegar yield of 20 jin of sorghum.

	The method of making vinegar with watermelon rind is roughly the same as that of sorghum vinegar. First, wash the watermelon rind, cook it thoroughly, let it cool, put it in a jar, add the daqu, mash and mix well, ferment for five days, then mix in the bran, stirring once in the morning and evening each day. After four days, add salt; after six days, remove the "embryo". Then, put one-third of the embryo into a smoking pot and smoke it for four days. Finally, add fresh water to the remaining two-thirds of the white embryo, filter and boil it, and add the smoked embryo filtrate to make delicious sour vinegar.

	Tomato Liqueur Brewed
	The bottled wine processing group of the Jinan City Tobacco, Wine, Sugar and Tea Wholesale Station uses tomatoes to produce tomato liqueur. Tomato liqueur has a special flavor and has now become a popular and best-selling product.

	The method of making tomato liqueur is very simple: select ripe red tomatoes, remove any insect-bitten, rotten parts, and stems, wash them with water, put them in bamboo containers to drain, then tear them into small pieces, or use a grinder to crush them. Then, put them in a raw silk (cloth) bag and use a wooden press to repeatedly squeeze out as much juice as possible (after three to four squeezes, the juice yield accounts for 75%-80%). Add 20% deodorized alcohol to the squeezed juice (alcohol deodorization is achieved by adding 10% birch charcoal to the alcohol and filtering it after 48 hours for immediate use). After stirring, it can be prepared into a 22-degree prepared tomato liqueur base – fruit juice wine.

	Add 1% protein clarifying agent (egg white) to the fruit juice wine, stir, and then add 80% water. Then, put it in an enamel pot and heat it to 65-75 degrees Celsius. After five minutes, remove it and quickly cool it to below 40 degrees Celsius.

	After heating, pour it into a vat (barrel) and seal it for five to seven days. Slowly draw off the residue with a rubber tube and continue to store it for ten to fifteen days before filtering and bottling.

	·Pumpkin Fermented into Soy Sauce·
	Currently, it is the peak season for pumpkins. If you can't finish eating them, you can use them to make soy sauce.

	The method of making soy sauce: first, cut the pumpkin open, remove the pulp, seeds, and skin, then cut it into small pieces, dry it in the sun for one or two days, then steam it in a steamer. Pour it onto a tray, and for every 100 jin, add 2-3 jin of flour, mix well, and spread it out to a thickness of about 1.5 inches. Cover with a piece of thin paper. After five or six days, it will start to ferment, and a layer of white fuzz will gradually grow on top. After another two or three days, the white fuzz will turn into yellow, red, or green flowers (black flowers are not good). When the flowers are full, remove the paper on the surface in time and dry it in the sun. Then, add one jin of salt for every jin of dried pumpkin, pour them together into a soy sauce jar, and add cold water (about 20 jin of water for every 5 jin of dried pumpkin) and expose it to the sun. Stir it once every morning. After a week, the water will gradually turn black and emit the aroma and taste of soy sauce. After sun-drying for another one or two weeks, the original water evaporates by four or five tenths, then add cold boiled water. Wait until it is half a jar, filter it with filter cloth, add fennel seeds and a little sugar, boil it in a pot for one or two hours, take it out and cool it, and you will have delicious, sweet soy sauce. If 1.5 liang of benzoin preservative is added for every 100 jin, it can be preserved for a long time.

	The remaining soy sauce residue can be mixed with red peppers, ginger, and other ingredients, and mixed evenly with dried vegetable gourds and glutinous rice porridge. They can be kneaded into small round cakes, dried in the sun, and then steamed in a steamer to make fragrant and spicy fermented soybean cakes.

    酒醋原料来路多
    西瓜皮能制醋
    山西省榆次市公私合营食品加工厂用西瓜皮制醋。每百斤西瓜皮加大曲十二斤半、谷糠二十斤、食盐四斤，可以制出六度的醋一百斤。相当于二十斤高粱的出醋量。
    用西瓜皮制醋方法大致和高粱醋相同。先把西瓜皮洗净煮熟，晾凉后装罐加曲，捣烂拌匀，发酵五天后拌糠，每天早晚搅拌一次，过四天加盐、六天出胚。然后把三分之一的胚装入熏罐烤熏四天，再把三分之二的白胚加生水过滤熬开，添入熏胚过滤即成美味酸醋。
    西红柿酿露酒
    济南市烟酒糖茶批发站瓶酒加工组，利用蕃茄（西红柿）制蕃茄露酒。蕃茄露酒具有特殊风味，目前已经成为群众欢迎的畅销商品。
    蕃茄露酒的制法很简单：选择红熟的蕃茄，并将虫蛀、腐烂、果把去掉，用水淘洗，装入竹制容器沥干，再把它撕成小块，或用绞碎机绞烂，然后装入生丝（布）口袋，用一木制压榨机，反复压榨，将果汁尽量榨出（经三—四次压榨，出汁率占75％—80％）。在压榨出的果汁中加入20％的脱臭酒精（酒精脱臭是将酒精中加入10％桦木炭，经四十八小时后过滤即可使用），经过搅拌就可配制成22度的配制蕃茄露酒的再制品——果汁酒。
    果汁酒内加1％的蛋白澄清剂（鸡蛋清），搅拌后加水80％，然后用搪瓷罐装好加温到摄氏65—75度，五分钟后取出，迅速降温至摄氏40度以下。
    加温后倒入缸（桶）密封储存五至七天，用胶皮管徐徐抽渣，续存十至十五天就可过滤装瓶。
    ·南瓜发酵成酱油·
    目前正是南瓜上市旺季，南瓜吃用不完，可以用来制酱油。
    制酱油的方法：先将南瓜剖开，除去瓜瓤、瓜籽和瓜皮，然后切成粒状，晾晒一、二天，再置甑中蒸熟，倒在团箕上，每百斤配面粉2—3斤，拌匀铺开，约厚一市寸半左右，上面可盖一张薄纸。经过五、六天，即起发酵作用，上面渐渐生出一层白毫。再经过二、三天白毫即变成黄花、红花或绿花（黑花就不好）。花满了以后，及时揭去面上的纸，放在太阳下晒干。然后每斤瓜干配食盐一斤，共同倒入酱缸内，再冲入冷水（约五斤瓜干加二十斤水）放在太阳下曝晒，每天早晨搅拌一次。经过一星期，水渐渐变黑色，发出酱油香气和味道，再晒一、二个星期，原水蒸发去十分之四、五，再冲冷开水。待再晒到半缸的时候，用滤布滤出，加入茴香子和糖少许，放在锅中煮沸一、二小时，取出冷却，即成美味香甜的酱油。如每百斤加放安息香防腐剂一两半，便可长久保藏。
    所余酱渣加入红椒、生姜及其他配料，用菜瓜干及糯米稀饭等调拌均匀，捏成小圆饼晒干，再放入甑中蒸熟，还可制成香辣可口的豆豉饼。
