Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 27th: TASS reports that twenty-six prominent Greek politicians and social activists, including former Prime Minister Gonatas and five former ministers, members of parliament, retired high-ranking officials, and cultural figures, have issued an appeal to the Greek government: Do not allow the establishment of missile bases on Greek territory, and support the proposal to establish a missile-free zone in the Balkans.

The appeal, published in the newspaper on the 27th, stated: "Establishing even a partially weapon-free zone, free of terrible weapons, can advance the cause of universal disarmament that people hope for. Establishing a missile-free zone guaranteed by both blocs would be a significant and very beneficial step for Greece in many ways... There is no reason to refuse to discuss this proposal, because such a refusal would subject Greece to the greatest threat in its history... We believe that every effort should be made to safeguard peace in the Balkans."

    希腊著名人士反对建立导弹基地
    新华社28日讯　塔斯社雅典27日讯：二十六名希腊著名政治家和社会活动家，其中有前首相戈纳塔斯和五名前任大臣、议员、退职的高级官员以及文化界人士，向希腊政府发出呼吁：不许在希腊领土上设置导弹基地、支持在巴尔干建立无导弹武器地区的主张。
    27日在报上发表的呼吁书说：“建立即使部分的不设置可怕武器的地区也能够把人们期望的普遍裁军的事业向前推进一步。建立得到两个集团都保证的无导弹地区在许多方面对希腊来说都是一项重大的和非常有益的步骤……拒绝讨论这个建议是没有任何道理的，因为这种拒绝会使希腊招致它历史上的最大威胁……我们认为，应当竭尽全力来维护巴尔干地区的和平。”
