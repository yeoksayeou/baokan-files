Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 30th -- The Dongxing Production Team of Xiaozhai People's Commune in Hengshui County, Hebei Province, has achieved a large-scale wheat bumper harvest. An experimental high-yield plot of 211.3 mu of wheat cultivated by the entire team, after actual harvesting, threshing, drying, winnowing, and weighing, achieved an average yield of 814.34 jin per mu. Driven by the high-yield plot, the average yield of 1,084 mu of wheat in the entire team reached 350 jin per mu.

　　The Dongxing Production Team is located on the right bank of the Fuyang River, where the land is barren, prone to drought without rain and flooding with heavy rain. In the past, wheat yields were generally only 70 to 80 jin per mu. Starting from the autumn sowing in 1957, the members made an ambitious goal of transforming low yield into high yield, and carried out a series of reforms in cultivation techniques. Last year's wheat harvest increased the average yield to 128 jin per mu. In order to completely eliminate the threat of drought, last autumn, the members also drilled two mechanized wells and built a diversion project on the Fuyang River to divert water for irrigation, achieving a double insurance of canals and wells, and transforming dry land into irrigated land.

　　Before sowing, all the team's wheat fields were deeply ploughed, and the seeds sown were all excellent varieties such as "Bi Ma No. 1" and "Shi Te No. 14." All wheat fields were rationally and densely planted. After the wheat emerged, fertilization and watering were carried out according to the weather, soil, and seedling conditions, achieving seven waterings and nine fertilizations, ensuring sufficient water and fertilizer.

　　In order to strengthen field management of wheat, the team selected members to form a specialized team to manage the high-yield plots. A wheat technology research group was also established, and all new management measures were first implemented in the high-yield plots under the guidance of the technology research group.

　　They paid special attention to summarizing the management experience of the high-yield plots and promptly applied it to the management of ordinary wheat fields. In the process of field management, the production team leaders also organized members of the high-yield plot specialized team to participate in production in ordinary fields, or absorbed members managing ordinary fields to participate in labor in the high-yield plots, based on the busy and slack seasons of agricultural work. Timely exchange of experience inside and outside the plots promoted a large-scale wheat bumper harvest.

### 丰产方引路  一般田紧追  衡水东兴生产队二百亩小麦亩产八百斤

    丰产方引路  一般田紧追
    衡水东兴生产队二百亩小麦亩产八百斤
    新华社石家庄30日电　河北省衡水县小寨人民公社东兴生产队获得小麦大面积丰产。全队种植的一块二百一十一亩三分小麦丰产方，经实收实打，晒干扬净过秤，平均每亩产量达到八百一十四点三四斤。在丰产方的带动下，全队一千零八十四亩小麦，平均每亩产量也达到了三百五十斤。
    东兴生产队在滏阴河右岸，土地贫瘠，原来无雨就旱，雨大就涝，过去小麦产量一般每亩只有七、八十斤。从1957年秋种时起，社员们立下了变低产为高产的雄心大志，在耕作技术上进行了一系列的改革，去年麦收时，平均每亩产量曾增加到一百二十八斤。为了彻底解除干旱威胁，去年秋季，社员们又打了两眼机井，并在滏阴河上兴修了截流工程，引水灌田，达到了渠井双保险，把旱地改成了水浇地。
    全队麦田在播种前都实行了深翻，播下的种子都是“碧蚂一号”和“石特十四号”等优良品种，全部麦田实行了合理密植。小麦出苗后，看天看地看苗施肥浇水，做到了七水九肥，水足肥饱。
    为了加强小麦田间管理，这个队抽调社员组成专业队，专门管理丰产方；又成立小麦技术研究小组，一切新的管理措施，都在技术研究小组指导下，先在丰产方中实行。
    他们特别注意总结丰产方的管理经验，并且及时地把它运用到一般麦田的管理中去。在田间管理过程中，生产队领导方面还根据农时季节的忙闲，组织丰产方专业队的社员到一般田参加生产，或者吸收管一般田的社员到丰产方参加劳动，方内方外的经验及时交流，促使小麦获得了大面积丰产。
