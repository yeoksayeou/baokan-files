The East China Mechanical System Industry Conference proves: Strengthening material adjustment work within the same industry is very beneficial in resolving the contradiction between the timing, variety, and specifications of material supply and production needs.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: The First Ministry of Machine Building recently convened an East China region mechanical industry material adjustment conference in Shanghai. At the meeting, over ten thousand tons of materials were adjusted, and over ten thousand contracts for material adjustment were signed. Many enterprises obtained some materials urgently needed for current production.

The Nanjing Chenguang Machinery Factory produces equipment for manufacturing cables, which is urgently needed in various locations. However, due to the lack of one or two accessories, complete sets could not be shipped. At the meeting, the Jinan Municipal Industrial Bureau of Shandong Province assisted them in solving the accessory problem. Jiangxi Province was manufacturing sugar-making machines that could process one thousand tons of sugarcane per day. They had all the other materials, but lacked round steel with a diameter of 400 mm. The conference arranged for them to receive this specification of round steel. There are many materials that, although needed in small quantities, are indispensable. For example, the Shanghai Marine Auxiliary Machinery Factory was affected in its instrument production due to the lack of zinc sheets. The Shandong Provincial Industrial Department only adjusted two hundred kilograms of zinc sheet scraps, which proved very useful to the factory. A bearing in the Datong Cement Factory in Shanxi broke, and the purchasing personnel could not find a replacement after searching several places. As a result, they found it at this meeting.

In the process of adjusting materials, many enterprise representatives demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation. They publicized the materials their factories could provide for adjustment in the form of large-character posters. Some representatives posted large-character posters while calling back to the factory to check, and then publicized the available materials for adjustment in large-character posters. The Shanghai Power Machinery School has already actively adjusted over forty tons of steel, while only adjusting in five or six tons, with a large difference between inflow and outflow. However, in order to meet the needs of other units, they further appropriately reduced their own usage and "squeezed out" more than ten tons of materials to adjust to others.

Many representatives attending the meeting believed that the arrangement of production plans and the allocation of raw materials in the current mechanical industry enterprises are generally balanced. However, there are still some contradictions between the timing, variety, and specifications of material supply and production needs. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen adjustment work. At the same time, according to the situation at the adjustment meeting, it can be seen that there are still many surplus, temporarily unused, or squeezable materials that can be adjusted in the mechanical factories in various provinces and cities. If this form of intra-industry exchange meeting is fixed and held several times a year, it will be very beneficial for mutual exchange.

### 调剂物资　保证急用

    调剂物资　保证急用
    华东机械系统同行业会议证明：加强同行业物资调剂工作对解决材料供应的时间品种规格与生产需要之间的矛盾有很大好处
    新华社上海讯　第一机械工业部最近在上海召开了华东地区机械工业材料调剂大会。会上调剂了一万多吨物资，签订了一万多项调剂材料的合同，许多企业得到了一部分当前生产急需的物资。
    南京晨光机器厂生产的制造电缆的设备，各地急迫需要，但由于缺少一二种配件，不能成套出厂。会上，由山东济南市工业局协助他们解决了配件问题。江西省制造日榨一千吨甘蔗的制糖机，其它材料都有了，就缺少四百糎直径的圆钢，会议为他们调剂了这种规格的圆钢。有许多材料，虽然需要量很少，但是缺它不行。比如上海船用辅机厂因缺乏锌板影响仪表生产，山东省工业厅只调出二百公斤锌板的边角，就给这个厂派了大用场。山西大同水泥厂有一副轴承坏了，采购人员跑了好几个地方都没有配上，结果在这次会上找到了。
    在调剂物资的过程中，许多企业的代表都发挥了共产主义协作精神。他们把自己工厂可供调剂的材料用大字报公布出来，有的代表一面贴大字报，一面打电话回厂清查，查出可供调剂的物资后，又用大字报公布。上海动力机器学校已经主动调剂出四十多吨钢材，调进的只有五六吨，出入相差很大。但是，他们为了满足其他单位的需要，进一步适当地压缩了自己的使用量，又“挤”出十多吨材料调给别人。
    参加这次会议的许多代表认为，当前机械工业企业生产计划的安排与原料材料的分配大体上是平衡的，但材料供应的时间、品种、规格与生产需要还存在一些矛盾，因此，有必要加强调剂工作。同时，根据调剂会上的情况可以看出，当前各省市机械工厂多余的、暂时不用的、或者挤一挤可供调剂的物资也还不少。如果把这一种同行业的交流会的形式固定下来，每年召开几次，对互通有无将有很大好处。
