    Taiyuan, July 23rd (This newspaper) – Various areas in Shanxi Province are actively improving the material supply work in coal mining areas to ensure miners have a good life and good production.
    Party secretaries and industrial department heads in Changzhi, Datong, Yangquan, and other places have recently visited coal mines to understand the production and living problems of workers. Under the leadership of local Party committees, commercial and grain departments have made the supply work in coal mining areas the focus of their current work, and have made comprehensive arrangements for the supply of daily necessities and staple and non-staple foods. The Provincial Department of Commerce recently sent people to key mining areas to understand the problems in the supply work and summarize successful experiences.
    Commercial departments in various regions first paid attention to ensuring the living needs of underground workers, appropriately increasing the supply of meat, eggs, vegetables, pastries, as well as non-staple foods such as cigarettes, alcohol, sugar, and aquatic products. Grain departments also increased the proportion of refined grains supplied to underground workers.
    Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce also decided that coal mines can directly pick up goods from secondary procurement and supply stations; the supply of work clothes, light bulbs, soap, and other daily necessities required by coal mines should be given priority as much as possible. Relevant industrial departments are also actively increasing the production of these daily necessities. Taiyuan City allocated the recent increase of 20,000 boxes of soap specifically for coal miners. Currently, the soap supply for Yangquan coal miners has increased by two times compared to the past.
    Chongqing, July 23rd (This newspaper) – Commercial departments in Chongqing are actively strengthening the supply of goods and living services in industrial and mining areas.
    The Municipal Bureau of Commerce has established a special organization to manage commercial work in industrial and mining areas. Each district and county commercial bureau in the suburbs of the city also has a leading cadre specifically responsible for the supply work in industrial and mining areas. Supply points have been added in various industrial and mining areas. In the suburban counties of Ba, Changshou, and Qijiang, seven trading stores have been established in new industrial and mining areas. To facilitate employees to buy goods, many trading stores, in addition to setting up supply points in workshops and mobile service points, also entrusted family members of employees to sell daily necessities on their behalf. Trading stores also opened night meal departments or workshop restaurants, so that workers on the night shift can also eat hot meals.
    Recently, the strength of the catering service industry has been universally replenished in various industrial and mining areas. Various trading stores have expanded their service items. The Shijingpo Trading Store, with the assistance of local people, has added fifteen items such as photography, laundry, and shoe shining. The Guojiatuo Trading Store has set up a service department to handle more than 150 service items for employees, including weddings and funerals. This service department is called the "omnipotent service department" by employees. Many trading stores have also helped employees' families set up public canteens.

    山西重庆全面布置工矿区百货和主副食品供应工作
    保证矿工生活好生产好
    本报太原23日电　山西省各地积极改善煤矿区的物资供应工作，保证矿工生活好，生产好。
    长治、大同、阳泉等地的党委书记、工业部长，最近都曾到煤矿访问职工，了解生产和生活方面的问题。在各地党委领导下，商业、粮食部门都把煤矿区的供应工作作为当前工作重点，对日用百货和主、副食品的供应工作做了全面部署。省商业厅最近还派人到重点矿区了解供应工作中的问题，总结成功的经验。
    各地商业部门首先注意保证井下工人的生活需要，适当地给他们增加了肉类、鸡蛋、蔬菜、糕点以及烟、酒、食糖、水产品等副食品的供应量。粮食部门也给井下工人增加了细粮的供应比例。
    最近，山西省商业厅还决定：各煤矿可以直接到二级采购供应站取货；煤矿需要的工作服用布、灯泡、肥皂等百货日用品，应尽量优先保证供应。有关工业部门也在积极增产这些日用品。太原市把最近增产的两万箱肥皂专供煤矿工人使用。现在，阳泉煤矿工人的肥皂供应量已比过去增加了两倍。
    本报重庆23日电　重庆市商业部门积极加强工矿区的商品供应和生活服务工作。
    市商业局成立了专门机构，管理工矿区的商业工作。市郊各区、县商业局也有一名领导干部专门负责工矿区的供应工作。各工矿区增设了供应点。市郊巴县、长寿、綦江三个县就在新工矿区成立了七个贸易商店，许多贸易商店为便利职工买货，除设立车间的供应点和流动服务点外，还委托职工家属代销日用品。贸易商店还开办夜餐部或车间餐厅，使夜班工人也能吃到热菜热饭。
    最近，各工矿区普遍充实了饮食服务行业的力量。各个贸易商店都扩大了服务项目。石井坡贸易商店在当地群众协助下，增加了照像、洗染、擦皮鞋等十五个项目。郭家沱贸易商店设立服务部，代职工办理包括婚、丧等事在内的一百五十多种服务项目。这个服务部被职工们称为“万能服务部”。许多贸易商店还帮助职工家属成立了公共食堂。
