Hubei: Implement the "Eight-Character Charter" Comprehensively and Rationally with Manure Accumulation as the Center

Xinjiang: Formulate Eight Tillage Technical Measures for Planting Winter Wheat Well in Northern Xinjiang

Guizhou: Adjust Winter Sowing Area and Varieties, Determine the Range of Deep Plowing and Close Planting

(Our newspaper Wuhan, July 19th dispatch) The Hubei Provincial Winter Sowing Conference, which recently closed here, based on the experience of this year's summer crop bumper harvest, proposed the task of launching a winter production campaign centered on manure accumulation, comprehensively and rationally implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase this winter, and striving for a bigger summer harvest next year. It also initially determined various specific measures to achieve the above tasks.

The meeting believed that the fundamental reason for this year's summer crop bumper harvest in the province was that the people's communes, under the leadership of the Party, fully demonstrated the superiority of the communes and conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Since the beginning of last winter, the province has launched an unprecedented large-scale deep plowing and close planting movement, so from the perspective of many areas, the historical habit of extensive cultivation in the past has greatly changed. Wheat fields have been generally plowed deeper and the density has been increased compared to last year. At the same time, the northern and southern regions have carried out ditch and furrow reforms and timely sowing in accordance with local conditions. Various places have also grasped the management of wheat fields tightly. These are all important experiences in achieving a bumper harvest of summer crops this year. In the process of summarizing and exchanging experiences, everyone unanimously believed that Xiangyang Prefecture had done a better job in the above aspects, especially their experience in preventing the emergence of three types of seedlings at the time of planting, which has a huge significance for promoting large-scale balanced production increase. Their experience is: 1. Eliminate blank seeds from going into the field and apply sufficient base fertilizer; 2. Deep plowing and fine land preparation; 3. Appropriate seeding rate to achieve rational close planting; Therefore, the meeting required vigorous promotion everywhere. At the same time, the participants, in the spirit of affirming achievements, summarizing experiences, drawing lessons, boosting morale, and continuing to move forward, seriously examined the shortcomings that existed in last year's winter work. From a large number of facts examined, it can be seen that wherever the masses are fully mobilized and relied upon, and adherence to local conditions is maintained, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is implemented well, and production increase is large; otherwise, production increase is small or even reduced.

On the basis of comprehensively summarizing the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter," and based on the experience of this year's summer bumper harvest, the participants focused on studying several key technical issues such as deep plowing, close planting, and sowing methods. Everyone unanimously believed that in terms of deep plowing, it is necessary to adopt the principle of actively carrying out and acting according to one's ability, based on specific conditions such as soil quality, draft animals, tools, and fertilizers. The general requirement is to deepen by about one inch on the existing basis. On the issue of close planting, according to the results of surveys and observations in various places, it is necessary to correctly grasp the seeding rate, with 20 to 25 catties per mu being appropriate, with a maximum not exceeding 30 catties and a minimum not less than 15 catties. As for sowing methods, the following principles should be considered: 1. Close planting, paying attention to both land utilization and ventilation and light transmission; 2. Simple and easy sowing, convenient for field management; 3. In double-cropping areas, it is conducive to intercropping of later crops. In short, everything must be tested, discussed with the masses, and any successful and effective practices should be boldly promoted.

The meeting believed that due to the above achievements and experiences in last year's winter sowing work, especially the bumper harvest of summer crops, the enthusiasm of the masses is even greater, which provides extremely favorable conditions for a bigger summer crop harvest next year. Under this favorable situation, as long as various places continue to adhere to putting politics in command, boldly mobilize the masses, implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase in accordance with local conditions, it is entirely possible to strive for a bigger harvest next year. To this end, the meeting comprehensively arranged this year's winter sowing production, starting from the overall increase in production and long-term increase in production, and based on national needs and actual possibilities, as well as the principles of planting in accordance with local conditions and proportionally. The meeting required all localities to conscientiously mobilize the masses, promptly summarize summer harvest experiences, and make various preparations as early as possible. The meeting also required all localities to resolutely implement the measures of "five grasps," "four goods," and "one comprehensive." The five grasps are to grasp the area, grasp the season, grasp fertilizer, grasp management, and grasp disaster resistance; the four goods are to prepare well, plant well, manage well, and harvest well. These are the keys to implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" well. To do these tasks well, the guiding ideology must first be comprehensive: First, it is necessary to look ahead and behind, and the upper and lower seasons must be well connected; second, it is necessary to establish the idea of comprehensive and balanced production increase, treating all crops equally; third, it is necessary to grasp both yield per unit area and total output.

This meeting started on June 29 and ended on July 7. More than 250 agricultural administrative and technical cadres from the province, prefectures, and counties participated in the meeting.

(Our newspaper Urumqi, July 19th dispatch) The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recently held a wheat on-site meeting in Manas, summarizing the experience of increasing wheat production this year, putting forward eight measures for planting winter wheat well, and deploying the winter wheat sowing work in the northern Xinjiang region.

Production leading cadres from eight prefectures and autonomous prefectures and twenty-seven counties in northern Xinjiang who participated in the on-site meeting visited large-scale high-yielding fields and a few extremely high-yielding fields in the Hongqi People's Commune, the Beiwucha People's Commune in Manas County, and the Mosuowan Farm of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. After summing up, the meeting believed that the reason why winter wheat grew so well this year was mainly due to the following five technical measures: 1. Deep plowing to eighteen to twenty-two centimeters; 2. Applying base fertilizer and topdressing in stages; 3. The seeding rate is generally around 25 to 35 catties; 4. Good field management; 5. Grasping the work of preventing frost, preventing freezing, preventing drought, preventing insects, and preventing lodging. Based on this year's bumper harvest experience, the meeting deployed the winter wheat sowing preparation work in the northern Xinjiang region and proposed eight measures: (1) Vigorously grasp summer plowing and deep plowing. The benefits of summer plowing are that it can improve soil fertility, improve the soil, resist drought, and eliminate weeds and pests. It is required that the area of summer plowing should reach 50% to 70% of the winter wheat area. According to existing conditions, deep plowing should generally reach 20 to 25 centimeters, and good conditions should reach 30 centimeters. The soil layer should reach 20 centimeters if it is shallow. (2) Apply all planting fertilizer, expand the area of base fertilizer application, and expand snow before topdressing according to local conditions. (3) Combine the summer harvest to do a good job of summer selection, retain good seeds, and realize basic improvement of varieties. (4) Vigorously grasp tool reform and promote the deep plowing plow that has been successfully tested. (5) Sow in a timely manner. (6) Rational close planting. The meeting believed that the principle of rational close planting should be determined according to soil, fertility, and variety. The emergence rate of compacted soil is low, so it can be denser; the emergence rate of sandy soil is fast, so it can be sparser; fertile soil can be denser, and barren soil can be sparser than fertile soil; timely sowing can be sparser, and late sowing can be denser; seeds with large grains and less tillering can be denser, and seeds with small grains and more tillering can be sparser. According to the situation in northern Xinjiang, the seeding rate should generally reach 28 to 35 catties. (7) Timely and appropriate winter irrigation and vigorous promotion of small furrow irrigation. (8) Prepare pesticides in advance and mix all seeds. The meeting believed that this year's wheat production in northern Xinjiang has rich experience in technical measures such as deep plowing, close planting, fertilization, and field management, as well as leadership methods. It required all localities to rely on the masses, systematically summarize, and formulate specific production increase measures for winter wheat sowing in various places, so as to promote next year with this year.

(Our newspaper Guiyang, July 19th dispatch) Guizhou Province draws on the successful experience of this year's summer harvest of crops, adopts the spirit of looking at next year from this year and looking at the next step from the current step, and starts arranging winter sowing work as early as possible. At the provincial agricultural work conference held in early July, it was initially determined that the province will sow 18.5 million mu this winter, more than double that of last year. It is required that while striving for a bumper harvest of autumn crops, all localities properly arrange winter sowing land and varieties, implement the plan to the team and the field, make the necessary preparations, comprehensively implement various production increase measures in winter sowing, and strive for a greater bumper harvest of summer crops next year.

Guizhou mountainous areas have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of summer grain crops, especially wheat, this year. On the basis of summarizing the experience of increasing production, the meeting required that wheat, rapeseed and other crops should grow better next year than this year. And according to the current objective situation in Guizhou and the experience of wheat production increase, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of combining more planting and more harvesting with less planting and high-yield more harvesting. According to the national plan and the needs of all ethnic groups, the meeting arranged the winter sowing area this year to be 18.5 million mu, with wheat and rapeseed each accounting for 6 million mu. This arrangement is positive and feasible from the perspective of Guizhou's existing labor force, land, technology, and other actual conditions.

The meeting comprehensively considered the rational arrangement of winter sowing land and varieties, in order to solve the contradictions in the harvest season of summer crops and the planting season of spring crops, and to ensure bumper harvests in both seasons. The meeting suggested that all localities should consider the summer harvest crops and autumn harvest crops together when sowing this winter, so that they can be connected, and attention should be paid not to make the planting varieties single, and more varieties can be selected, so that the sowing and harvesting time can be staggered, easing the tension of labor.

In order to ensure timely sowing, the meeting emphasized grasping the preparation of seeds and fertilizers before winter sowing. It is required that all localities retain sufficient seeds as early as possible according to the sowing plan, especially the seeds of small miscellaneous grains must be solved in a timely manner. As for fertilizers, all localities should prepare 5,000 catties of fertilizer per mu for winter crops through the summer fertilizer accumulation campaign.

The meeting conducted a detailed discussion on how to comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in this year's winter sowing, and unanimously believed that: in terms of deep plowing, it is more appropriate to roughly plow one foot or so. Generally, soil with medium fertility must have four to five thousand catties of high-quality fertilizer as base fertilizer. In rational close planting, the seeding rate of wheat per mu is 20 to 30 catties, and rapeseed is generally planted with about 10,000 to 15,000 plants per mu. The sowing season for various crops was also specifically studied. Regarding all autumn sowing technical measures, the meeting pointed out that it is necessary to conscientiously implement the mass line, widely mobilize the masses before winter sowing, further summarize the experience of summer harvest production increase, organize old farmers, young people, and adults to meet together, implement the measures, and make this year's winter sowing better in order to ensure a greater bumper harvest in the summer of 1960.

    总结今年夏季丰产经验　力争明年夏季更大丰收
    三省及早提出冬播具体措施
    湖北：以积肥为中心全面合理贯彻“八字宪法”
    新疆：为种好北疆冬麦制定八项耕作技术措施
    贵州：调整冬播面积和品种确定深耕密植幅度
    本报武汉19日电　最近在这里闭幕的湖北省冬播会议，根据今年夏季作物丰收的经验，提出了在今冬开展一个以积肥为中心的全面合理贯彻农业增产“八字宪法”的冬季生产运动、力争明年夏季更大丰收的任务，并且初步确定了实现上述任务的各项具体措施。
    会议认为，今年全省夏季作物大丰收的根本原因是：人民公社在党的领导下充分地发挥了公社的优越性，认真贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”。从去年冬初起，全省就掀起了空前未有的大规模的深耕密植运动，因而从许多地区来看，过去耕作粗放的历史习惯有了很大改变，小麦地普遍比去年耕深了，密度也比去年加大了，同时，北部和南部地区都因地制宜地进行了沟厢改革和适时播种，各地对麦田管理也一直抓得较紧。这些都是今年夏季作物取得大丰收的重要经验。在总结交流经验中，大家一致认为，襄阳专区在上述各方面都做得较好，特别是这个专区在种的时候就防止出现三类苗的经验，对促进大面积平衡增产有着巨大的意义。他们的经验是：一、消灭白籽下田，施足底肥；二、深耕、精细整田；三、播种量适当，作到合理密植；因此会议要求各地大力推广。和这同时，与会者还本着肯定成绩，总结经验，吸取教训，鼓足干劲，继续前进的精神，认真地检查了去年冬季工作中存在的缺点。从检查的大量事实来看，凡是充分发动和依靠群众，坚持因地制宜的地方，农业“八字宪法”贯彻得就好，增产就大；反之，则增产很少甚至减产。
    与会者在全面总结贯彻“八字宪法”的基础上，并且根据今年夏季丰收的经验，着重研究了深耕、密植和播种方式等几个关键性的技术问题。大家一致认为，在深耕方面，必须根据土质、耕畜、工具、肥料等具体条件，采取积极进行和量力而为的原则。一般的要求在现有的基础上再加深一寸左右。密植问题，根据各地调查观察的结果，必须正确掌握下种量，每亩用种二十至二十五斤为宜，最多不超过三十斤，最少不少于十五斤。至于播种方式，则应考虑这样几个原则：一、密植，既注意土地利用率，又要注意通风透光；二、播种简便易行，便利田间管理；三、在两熟作物地区，有利后期作物套种。总之，一切必须经过试验，多和群众商量，凡试验成功和行之有效的作法，就应大胆推广。
    会议认为，由于去年冬播工作取得了以上成绩和经验，特别是夏季作物的大丰收，群众干劲更大，这就给明年夏季作物更大丰收提供了极为有利的条件。在这一有利形势下，只要各地继续坚持政治挂帅，放手发动群众、因地制宜地贯彻执行农业增产“八字宪法”，争取明年更大丰收是完全可能的。为此，会议从全面增产和长远增产出发，并根据国家需要与实际可能和因地制宜、按比例种植的原则，全面安排了今年冬播生产。会议要求各地认真发动群众及时总结夏收经验，提早进行各项准备工作，还要求各地必须坚决贯彻“五抓”、“四好”、“一全面”的措施。五抓就是抓面积、抓季节、抓肥料、抓管理、抓抗灾；四好就是要准备好、种好、管理好、收获好。这些都是贯彻好“八字宪法”的关键。要做好这些工作，首先要指导思想全面：第一、要瞻前顾后，上下季茬口要衔接好；第二、要树立全面平衡增产的思想，各种作物一视同仁；第三、既要抓单产，又要抓总产。
    这次会议是从6月29日开始至7月7日结束的。参加会议的有省、专、县农业行政、技术干部共二百五十多人。
    本报乌鲁木齐19日电　新疆维吾尔自治区最近在玛纳斯召开了北疆地区小麦现场会议，总结了今年小麦增产经验，提出种好冬麦的八项措施，布置了北疆地区的冬麦播种工作。
    参加现场会议的北疆八个专区和自治州的二十七个县的生产领导干部，在玛纳斯县参观了红旗人民公社、北五岔人民公社和新疆生产建设兵团莫索湾农场大面积丰产田和少数高额丰产田。经过总结，会议认为今年冬麦所以生长得这样好，在技术措施方面主要有这样五条经验：一、深耕了十八到二十二厘米，二、施基肥，分期追肥，三、下种量一般在二十五斤到三十五斤左右，四、田间管理工作好，五、抓紧了防霜、防冻、防旱、防虫和防倒伏的工作。会议根据今年丰产经验，布置了北疆地区冬麦播种准备工作，并提出了八项措施：（一）大抓伏耕和深耕。伏耕的好处一能提高土壤肥力，二能改良土壤，三能抗旱，四能消灭杂草和虫害，要求伏耕面积要达到冬麦面积的50％到70％。深耕根据现有条件，一般要达到二十到二十五厘米，条件好的要达到三十厘米，土层浅的应达到二十厘米。（二）全部施种肥，扩大施基肥的面积，因地制宜地扩大雪前追肥。（三）结合夏收作好夏选工作，留好良种，实现基本良种化。（四）大抓工具改革，推广已经试验成功的深耕犁。（五）适时播种。（六）合理密植。会议认为合理密植的原则应该是因土壤、因肥力、因品种而定，板结土出苗率低可稠些，沙土地出苗快可稀些；肥地可稠些，瘠地比肥地可稀些，适期播种的可稀些，迟播的可稠些；种籽粒大、分蘖较少的可稠些，种籽粒小、分蘖较多的可稀些。根据北疆地区情况，播种量一般达到二十八到三十五斤为宜。（七）适时、适量冬灌、大力推广小畦灌溉。（八）提前准备农药、全部拌种。会议认为今年北疆各地小麦生产在深耕、密植、施肥、田间管理等技术措施上和领导方法上，都有丰富经验，要求各地依靠群众，系统总结，定出各地播种冬麦的具体增产措施，作到以今年促进明年。
    本报贵阳19日电　贵州省吸取今年夏收作物大丰收的成功经验，本今年看明年、上步看下步精神，及早着手安排冬播工作。在7月上旬召开的全省农业工作会议上，初步确定今年全省冬播一千八百五十万亩，比去年扩大一倍多，要求各地在力争大秋作物丰收的同时，妥善安排冬播田土和品种，把计划落实到队到田，做好应有的准备，在冬播中全面贯彻各项增产措施，争取明年夏收作物更大丰收。
    贵州山区今年夏收粮食作物特别是小麦获得空前大丰收。会议在总结增产经验的基础上，要求使明年小麦、油菜等作物长得比今年更好。并根据贵州目前客观情况和小麦增产经验，坚决实行多种多收与少种高产多收相结合的方针。会议根据国家计划和各族人民的需要，安排今年冬播面积为一千八百五十万亩，其中小麦、油菜各占六百万亩。这个安排从贵州现有劳力、土地、技术等实际情况来看，是积极可行的。
    会议全面考虑了冬播土地和品种的合理安排，以解决明年夏收和春播栽种季节上的矛盾，保证两季丰收。会议建议各地在今年冬播时要把夏收作物和秋收作物统一考虑，使它衔接起来，并且注意不要使种植品种单一化，可多选用几个品种，使播种、收获时间能错开，缓和劳力的紧张。
    为了保证适时播种，会议强调抓紧冬播前种籽、肥料的准备工作。要求各地尽早按播种计划留足良种，特别是小杂粮种子更要及时解决。对于肥料，各地应通过夏季积肥运动给冬播作物每亩准备肥料五千斤。
    会议对各地在今年冬播中如何全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”进行了详细讨论，一致认为：在深耕方面，大致翻犁一尺左右是比较合适的。一般中等肥力的土壤，须有四、五千斤优质肥作基肥。在合理密植上，小麦每亩播种量二十至三十斤，油菜一般以每亩栽一万至一万五千株左右为宜。对各种作物的播种季节也作了具体研究。对所有各项秋播技术措施，会议指出要认真贯彻群众路线，在冬播前，广泛发动群众，更加深入地总结夏收增产经验，组织老农、青年和壮年在一起开会，把措施落实，使今年冬播做得更好，以保证1960年夏季的更大丰收。
