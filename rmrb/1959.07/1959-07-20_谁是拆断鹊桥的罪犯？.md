Who is the Criminal Who Broke the Magpie Bridge?
    Yue Xin
    By the Ben Hai River in the Vinh Linh district of Vietnam, there is the 17th parallel. Because the U.S. imperialists instructed the Ngo Dinh Diem clique of South Vietnam to violate the agreement, turning this temporary military demarcation line into a chasm that separates the unification of Vietnam, in the Vinh Linh district, almost every family has relatives and friends on the south bank of the Ben Hai River, unable to communicate and meet freely. How much love between husband and wife is severed, how many young men and women cannot freely express their feelings. On the Ben Hai River, such songs often float:
    A young man from Vinh Linh sings loudly: Separated by a river, within sight but unreachable. Only the seven-hole bridge exists, love is kept far apart! We are on opposite sides, how can one not feel heartbroken, we love each other so much, we must doubly hate our enemies!
    Then, the girls from Vinh Son and Vinh Liem on the south bank echo:
  The north and south banks are only a hundred feet apart,
  Who is the criminal who broke the magpie bridge?
  The shuttling ferryboats are nowhere to be seen,
  My heart is anxious, when will we meet!

    谁是拆断鹊桥的罪犯？
    越新
    边海江在越南的永灵区，这里有一条十七度线。由于美帝国主义指使南越吴庭艳集团违反协议，把这条临时军事分界线变成隔断越南统一的鸿沟，在永灵区，几乎所有的家庭都有亲戚朋友在边海江南岸，不能自由通信和见面。多少夫妻的恩爱被隔断，多少对青年男女不能畅叙情怀。在边海江上，经常飘荡着这样的歌声：
    永灵青年引吭高歌：隔着一条江哪，可望而不可即。只有七孔桥哪，情爱互相远离！彼此各一方哪，怎不叫人肠断心痛哩，你我这样恩爱哪，要加倍怒恨仇敌！于是，南岸永山、永廉的姑娘们，就随声应和：
  南堤北岸相距不过百尺，
  谁是拆断鹊桥的罪犯？
  穿梭的渡船无影无踪，
  妹心焦急呀何时能见面！
