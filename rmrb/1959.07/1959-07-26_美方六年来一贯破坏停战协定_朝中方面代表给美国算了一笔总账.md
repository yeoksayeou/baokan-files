Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 25th: At a meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission today, Major General Zhu Changjun, the chief representative of the Korean and Chinese side, systematically exposed the U.S. side's violations of the Armistice Agreement since the armistice and demanded that the U.S. military swiftly withdraw from South Korea.

On the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, Major General Zhu Changjun reviewed the work of the Military Armistice Commission since the armistice. He pointed out that the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement six years ago put an end to the Korean War launched by U.S. imperialism. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement not only opened the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue but was also a major event with positive significance for safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world and easing international tensions. However, due to the U.S. side's constant planning for war and hostile acts, the tense situation in Korea still exists. The Korean and Chinese side has repeatedly strived for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but due to the U.S. side's various obstructions, no success has been achieved to date.

Major General Zhu Changjun said: "Anyone who has read the minutes of this commission's meetings can clearly and correctly understand the following two completely different paths taken by the armistice parties: the Korean and Chinese side has always consistently strictly adhered to the Armistice Agreement and has made unremitting efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, while the U.S. side has constantly violated the Armistice Agreement, vigorously opposed the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and attempted to launch a new bloody war in Korea." Major General Zhu Changjun then listed facts to systematically expose the U.S. side's violations of the Armistice Agreement since the armistice. He pointed out that less than twenty minutes after the armistice took effect on July 27, 1953, the U.S. side violated the Armistice Agreement by shelling the Korean and Chinese side. In the past six years, U.S. aircraft have intruded into the airspace over the Korean and Chinese side's areas in 632 batches, totaling 1,303 sorties. At the same time, U.S. armed forces have also attacked civil police of the Korean and Chinese side in the Demilitarized Zone. The U.S. side has also constantly dispatched large numbers of special agents to the Korean and Chinese side. The Joint Observer Teams dispatched by the Military Armistice Commission have confirmed 27 such incidents. Since the armistice, the Korean and Chinese side has pointed out 852 incidents of violations of the Armistice Agreement by the U.S. side. More seriously, the U.S. side forcibly detained more than 48,000 prisoners of war from the Korean and Chinese side before and after the armistice and incorporated them into the armies of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek cliques. At the same time, they illegally transported in large quantities of war materials, expanding the Syngman Rhee puppet army from sixteen divisions to thirty-one divisions. The U.S. side illegally drove the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission out of South Korea. The U.S. side blatantly unilaterally abolished Paragraph 13D of the Armistice Agreement and then even transported in new weapons such as atomic cannons and missiles, reorganizing the U.S. forces invading Korea into atomic divisions. In addition, the U.S. side sabotaged the preliminary meeting for the political conference held in Panmunjom in 1953. At the Geneva Conference in 1954 and in the subsequent period, they rejected the reasonable proposals put forward by the Korean and Chinese side for a just resolution of the Korean issue, thereby hindering the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Major General Zhu Changjun concluded by pointing out: "Therefore, the only conclusion to be drawn is that, in order to guide the armistice towards a consolidated peace and in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, the U.S. aggressive troops that are obstructing the unification of Korea and bringing great misfortune and suffering to the Korean people should be withdrawn from South Korea immediately."

Major General Zhu Changjun also demanded that the U.S. side immediately cease all acts in violation of the Armistice Agreement and immediately withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea.

### 美方六年来一贯破坏停战协定  朝中方面代表给美国算了一笔总账

    美方六年来一贯破坏停战协定
    朝中方面代表给美国算了一笔总账
    据新华社平壤25日电　朝鲜军事停战委员会今天举行会议，朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在会上系统地揭露了美方自停战以来违反停战协定的行为，并且要求美军迅速撤出南朝鲜。
    在朝鲜停战协定签订六周年的时候，朱昌骏少将回顾了军事停战委员会从停战以来的工作情况。他指出，六年前朝鲜停战协定的签订，终止了美帝国主义发动的朝鲜战争，朝鲜停战协定的签订不仅打开了和平解决朝鲜问题的道路，而且是一件对保卫远东和世界和平、缓和国际紧张局势具有积极意义的重大事件。但是，由于美方不断地策划进行战争和敌对行为，所以朝鲜的紧张局势仍然存在。朝中方面一再为和平解决朝鲜问题努力，但由于美方多方面的阻挠，至今没有获得任何成就。
    朱昌骏少将说：“凡是读过本委员会会议记录的人，都可以清楚地和正确地了解到停战双方所采取的以下两条截然不同的路线，就是朝中方面始终一贯地严格遵守停战协定，并为和平解决朝鲜问题作了不懈的努力，而美方却不断违反停战协定，竭力反对朝鲜问题的和平解决，并力图在朝鲜发动新的流血战争”。朱昌骏少将接着列举事实系统地揭露美方自停战以来违反停战协定的行为。他指出：1953年7月27日停战生效后不到二十分钟，美方就违反停战协定，炮轰朝中方面。六年来侵入朝中方面地区上空的美方飞机达六百三十二批，一千三百零三架次，同时美方武装部队还在非军事区内袭击朝中方面民政警察。美方还不断地向朝中方面派遣大批特务，仅是军事停战委员会派遣联合观察小组调查证实的此类事件即达二十七次。停战以来，仅是朝中方面向美方指出过的违反停战协定的事件即达八百五十二起，更严重的是，美方在停战前后强迫扣留了四万八千多名朝中方面被俘人员，并把他们编入李承晚和蒋介石集团的军队，同时还非法运入大量作战物资，将李承晚伪军从十六个师扩充到三十一个师。非法将中立国视察小组从南朝鲜赶走。美方公然片面废除停战协定第十三款卯项，接着竟然运入原子大炮和导弹等新式武器，将侵朝美军改编为原子师。此外，美方破坏了1953年在板门店举行的政治会议预备会议。在1954年的日内瓦会议上以及在以后的时期中又拒绝了朝中方面为公正解决朝鲜问题而提出的合理方案，从而，阻碍了朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    朱昌骏少将最后指出：“因此得出的唯一结论是，为了把停战导向巩固的和平，为了和平解决朝鲜问题，首先应该立即把阻挠朝鲜的统一，给朝鲜人民带来莫大不幸和痛苦的美国侵略军队撤出南朝鲜。”
    朱昌骏少将并要求美方立即停止一切违反停战协定的行为，立即把美军从南朝鲜撤走。
