Please look, how proudly these Greek patriots are smiling in the military court! They have turned the court into a platform and the "defendants" into plaintiffs. Although the reactionaries are rampant for a time, he who laughs last laughs best! (The first person on the left in the second row is Glezos, and the two people standing behind are court police officers.)

    请看，这些希腊爱国者，在军事法庭上笑得多么自豪！他们把法庭变成了讲坛，把“被告”变成了原告。虽然反动派猖狂一时，可是谁笑得最后谁笑得最好！（第二排左起第一人是格列索斯，站在后面两人是法庭警察）
