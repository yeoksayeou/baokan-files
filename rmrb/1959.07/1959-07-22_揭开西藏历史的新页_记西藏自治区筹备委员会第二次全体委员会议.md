    Unveiling a New Page in Tibetan History
    ——A Record of the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region
    By Our Correspondent Zong Zidu
    The Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which lasted for twenty days and focused on discussing the work of democratic reform in Tibet, successfully concluded on the 17th of this month.

    This meeting announced the death of the serf system in Tibet, and a new page in Tibetan history has been opened.

    Reactionaries often make incorrect estimates of history. The former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique thought that launching a rebellion could maintain their bloody feudal rule forever, but the flames of rebellion burned themselves. When the Tibetan people cleared the stumbling blocks hindering democratic reform, destroyed the reactionary regime, and were able to freely and truly express their will, the call for democratic reform inevitably erupted. It was under such circumstances that the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region timely convened the Second Plenary Session to discuss the work of democratic reform in Tibet.

    This meeting was the most widely representative and enthusiastic historical event since the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region. During the meeting, both the plenary sessions and group meetings maintained a democratic, united, and enthusiastic atmosphere. The meeting spent thirteen days in group discussions, where the representatives spoke freely and fully consulted on the steps, methods, and specific policies for democratic reform in Tibet.

    Aristocratic upper-class figures unanimously thanked the central government and the Tibetan people for implementing the redemption policy towards them. They said that this was leniency towards them and sincerity in uniting and educating them. All the aristocratic upper-class figures who attended the meeting expressed their approval of democratic reform, their willingness to abandon exploitation, and to stand on the side of the working people. Among them were some of the largest serf owners in Tibet. In the discussions, they frankly said that they were one of the three major lords, and in the past, they had carried out a lot of oppression and exploitation of the working people. Now, they are determined to use practical actions to support democratic reform.

    In the conference room west of the office building of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, representatives from Tibetan Yellow Sect, Red Sect, White Sect and other religious circles conducted in-depth discussions on the "three antis" movement against rebellion, privilege, and exploitation in temples.

    The representatives pointed out in the discussion that the temples themselves and the upper-level lamas owned manors and pastures, and they carried out the same enslavement and exploitation of the poor lamas and serfs under their jurisdiction as other serf owners. A farmer in Jama Village under Ganden Monastery borrowed forty ke of qing稞 from Ganden Monastery's Laji (financial management institution). This farmer repaid the debt to Laji every year, and after generations of repayments, not only had it not been repaid, but it had grown like a snowball to 40,000 ke. Representatives from Drepung Monastery also revealed that the most ferocious reactionary monk official Suba Jinba Zhimei, nicknamed "Dakare" (rotten mouth tiger), had exploited 60,000 taels of Tibetan silver (equivalent to more than 100,000 yuan in RMB) from the serfs belonging to Drepung Monastery during his ten years as the general manager of Laji. Most of the poor lamas in the monastery were only given a little more than one ke of qing稞 each year.

    The poor lamas attending the meeting used their personal experiences to accuse the temple of oppressing and exploiting them. Jumei Renzeng, a poor lama from Drepung Monastery, said: "Under the rule of the temple's layers of dark systems, and under the oppression of feudal privileges, we poor lamas do not even have personal freedom, where is there freedom of religious belief! Poor lamas spend their whole lives sweeping the floor in the temple and are still sweeping the floor, and they cannot even learn the most basic Buddhist teachings. Can this be considered freedom of religious belief? In order to suppress us and the common people, the temples also have prisons, whips and other instruments of torture. Where are such regulations in Buddhism!"

    The lama representatives attending the meeting became more and more indignant as they talked, and unanimously believed that only by opposing the temple's oppression, exploitation and feudal privileges can the lamas live a normal religious life, and only then can they talk about true freedom of religious belief.

    In these days, the political atmosphere in Lhasa was very active, and everyone was talking about reform and progress. This castle, which was once the ruling center of the feudal serf system, has become the revolutionary center that the entire Tibetan people are concerned about. Laboring people's representatives from all over reflected the voices of the broad masses of the people to the meeting. For the first time in their lives, they sat in the same seat as aristocratic upper-class figures to jointly discuss national affairs, and for the first time in their lives, they stepped onto the solemn podium to freely express their opinions in front of hundreds of people. Times have changed, history has changed, and how excited are people! When Ci Cheng, the old servant of the traitor Lhalu Tsewong Dorje, Renzeng Dorje, the serf of the rebel Dokongba Tubdain Nyima, and Bazu and Qunpei, poor farmers from the suburbs, stepped onto the presidium of the conference, stood in front of the loudspeaker and expressed their firm support for democratic reform and exposed the darkness of the feudal serf system, a storm of applause suddenly rang out in the hall. After Shai Zhu, a poor farmer representing the farmer brothers of Dagze County, spoke at the conference, he returned to his seat and said to his companions beside him: "I am too excited today. This is a real turnaround for us poor people. In the past, we had no right to ask about politics at all. Look at how much importance is given to the opinions of us poor people today!"

    The 17th was the last day of the meeting. In the Lhasa Auditorium, people were invigorated, and the committee members and attending representatives warmly congratulated each other on "good luck." When the committee members unanimously raised their hands to pass the resolution on carrying out democratic reform, the applause shook the conference hall like thunder in spring. The feudal serf system was declared dead, and ula corvée, usury, and personal dependence were declared abolished. What an unforgettable moment this was for the Tibetan working people! Awang Siba, an attending representative from Dagze County, said that he owed hundreds of ke of grain in usury, and he repaid his debts every year, and he owed debts every year. Today, the shackles have been removed. Awang Siba said to the people around him that after returning, he would definitely work hard to produce and repay the kindness of the Communist Party. Karma Orzhu, a sixty-two-year-old poor farmer from Doilungdêqên County, said that he and ten poor farmers in his village cultivated the land of the former Tibetan local government and had to bear extremely heavy rents and corvée every year. When the resolution was passed, the old man's eyes were filled with tears. He said: "This is too good, the sun of happiness has really risen over the heads of the poor!"

    揭开西藏历史的新页
    ——记西藏自治区筹备委员会第二次全体委员会议
    本报记者　宗子度
    历时二十天，以讨论西藏民主改革工作为中心议题的西藏自治区筹备委员会第二次全体委员会议于本月17日胜利闭幕了。
    这次会议宣布了西藏农奴制度的死亡，西藏的历史揭开了新页。
    反动派常常是对历史作出错误的估计。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团以为发动叛乱就可以永远维持其血腥的封建统治，然而燃起的叛乱火焰却烧毁了他们自己。当西藏人民清除了阻挠民主改革的绊脚石，摧毁了反动政权，能够自由地真正地表达自己意志的时候，要求民主改革的呼声便不可抑止地爆发出来。西藏自治区筹委会就是在这样的形势下，及时召开了第二次全体委员会议，讨论西藏民主改革工作。
    这次会议是自治区筹委会自成立以来，代表性最广泛，情绪最热烈的一次具有历史意义的盛会。会议期间，无论大会和小组会都始终保持着民主、团结和热烈的气氛，会议用十三天的时间进行了小组讨论，在这里，代表们畅所欲言，对西藏民主改革工作的步骤、方法和各项具体政策作了分充的协商。
    贵族上层人士们一致感谢中央和西藏人民对他们实行的赎买政策。他们说这是对他们的宽大，对他们团结教育的诚意。所有参加会议的贵族上层人士，没有一个不表示赞同民主改革，愿意放弃剥削，站在劳动人民这一边来。在这里有一些西藏最大的农奴主，讨论中他们坦率地说：他们是三大领主中的一个，过去对劳动人民进行了很多压迫和剥削，现在决心要用实际行动来拥护民主改革。
    在西藏自治区筹委会办公大楼西边的会议室里，西藏黄教、红教、白教等宗教界代表，对在寺庙内进行反叛乱、反特权、反剥削的“三反”运动进行了深入的讨论。
    代表们在讨论中指出，寺庙本身和上层喇嘛都占有庄园和牧场，他们对所属的贫苦喇嘛和差民进行着同其他农奴主一样的奴役和剥削。噶丹寺山下加马村的一户农民曾借了噶丹寺拉基（管理财政的机构）四十克青稞，这家农民年年向拉基还债，还了几代人，不但没有还清，现在反而像滚雪团似的增长到了四万克。哲蚌寺的代表们还揭露该寺最凶恶的绰号“达卡热”（烂嘴巴老虎）的反动僧官苏巴晋巴之美，他在一任拉基总管的十年期间，就剥削了哲蚌寺所属差民六万多秤藏银（折合人民币十多万元），而寺庙的大多数贫苦喇嘛，每年只发给一克多一点的青稞。
    列席会议的贫苦喇嘛们用自己的亲身经历控诉了寺庙对他们的压迫剥削。哲蚌寺的贫苦喇嘛居美仁增说：“在寺庙层层黑暗制度的统治下，在封建特权的压迫下，我们贫苦喇嘛连人身自由都没有，那里还有信教的自由！穷喇嘛在寺庙里扫上一辈子地还是个扫地的，连最起码的佛法也学不到，这能算是信教自由吗？为了压制我们和老百姓，寺庙里还设有监狱、皮鞭等各种刑具，佛法上那有这样的规定！”
    列席的喇嘛代表们越谈越气愤，一致认为只有反掉寺庙的压迫剥削和封建特权，喇嘛们才能过正常的宗教生活，也才能谈得上真正的宗教信仰自由。
    在这些日子里，拉萨的政治空气十分活跃，到处都在谈改革、谈进步。这个曾是封建农奴制度的统治中心的城堡，变成了全西藏人民关注的革命中心。来自各地的劳动人民列席代表向会议反映了广大人民的呼声。他们生平第一次同贵族上层人士坐在一个席位上共同讨论国家大事，他们也生平第一次踏上隆重的讲坛在数百人面前自由地发表意见。时代变了，历史变了，人们怀着多么激动的心情呢？当叛国头子拉鲁·策旺多合的老佣人次成、叛乱分子多共巴·土登尼扎的差民人增多吉、郊区贫苦农民巴珠和群佩等走上大会主席台，站在扩音器前表示坚决拥护民主改革和揭露封建农奴制度黑暗的时候，会场上顿时响起了暴风雨般的掌声，贫苦农民晒珠代表达孜宗的农民弟兄在大会上发言后，回到座位上对身旁的同伴们说：“我今天太兴奋了，这是我们穷苦人真正翻身。过去我们根本无权过问政治，你看今天我们穷苦人的意见得到了多么样的重视！”
    17日是会议的最后一天。拉萨大礼堂里人心振奋，委员们，列席代表们彼此热烈祝贺“吉祥如意”。当委员们一齐举手通过关于进行民主改革的决议的时候，掌声像春雷一般地震荡着会议大厅。封建农奴制度宣告死亡了，乌拉差役、高利贷和人身依附宣告废除了，这对西藏劳动人民来说是一个多么难忘的时刻啊！达孜宗的列席代表阿旺司巴说，他欠了几百克粮食的高利贷，年年还债，年年欠债，今天枷锁一下解除了。阿旺司巴向着身边的人说，回去以后，一定努力生产，报答共产党的恩情。堆龙德庆宗的列席代表，六十二岁的贫苦农民噶马俄珠说，他和同村的十户贫苦农民耕种着原西藏地方政府的土地，每年都要担负异常繁重的租贡和差役，当决议通过的时候，老人激动得两眼充满了泪花，他说：“这太好了，穷人头上真的升起幸福的太阳了！”
