Several Native Pesticides for Preventing Vegetable Diseases

	Chinese Sumac (Ailanthus altissima) – Belongs to the Simaroubaceae family, growing in both the north and south of China. Chinese Sumac contains substances such as saponins, tannins, and essential oils, which have insecticidal and disease-preventing effects. One catty of Chinese Sumac leaves mixed with three catties of water, filtered, and the resulting juice can be used to control cabbage worms and aphids. Research experiments by the Institute of Plant Protection of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences show that an 11-fold water extract of Chinese Sumac root powder has a control effectiveness of 89% against vegetable aphids.

	Pomegranate – Belongs to the Punicaceae family, cultivated in various places, and also found in the wild. Also known as stone pomegranate, sour pomegranate, Danruo, golden poppy, etc. Deciduous shrub or small tree, leaves are opposite, oblong or oblong-lanceolate, with a shiny leaf surface. Flowers are light yellow or red. According to Anhui's experience, one catty of pomegranate peel mixed with ten catties of water, boiled for half an hour, and filtered, can treat vegetable worms. According to indoor measurements by the Hubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 5% pomegranate peel powder has a 100% effect on controlling cabbage soft rot disease. Field trials also showed a 100% effect on controlling radish soft rot disease.

    防治蔬菜病害几种土农药简介
    臭椿——属苦木科，我国南北各地都有生长。臭椿含有皂素、单宁、香精油等物质，有杀虫防病作用。臭椿叶一斤加水三斤，过滤后的汁液，可防治青虫、蚜虫。农业科学院植物保护研究试验，臭椿根粉的十一倍水浸液，对菜蚜虫防治效能达到89％。
    安石榴——属安石榴科，各处有栽培，也有野生。俗名石榴、酸石榴、丹若、金罂等。落叶灌木或小乔木，叶对生，长椭圆形或长椭圆披针形，叶面有光亮。花淡黄色或红色。据安徽经验，石榴皮一斤加水十斤，煮沸半小时，过滤，可治菜虫。据湖北农业科学研究所室内测定，5％的石榴皮粉，对防治白菜软质病效果达100％。田间试验对防治萝卜软质病效果也达100％。
