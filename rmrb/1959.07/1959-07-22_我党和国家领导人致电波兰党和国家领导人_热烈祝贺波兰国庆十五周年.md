Xinhua News Agency, July 21st—Today, Chinese Party and State Leaders sent a congratulatory telegram to Polish United Workers' Party and State Leaders, warmly celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Polish People's Republic's National Day. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To Comrade Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Comrade Aleksander Zawadzki, Chairman of the Council of State of the Polish People's Republic, Comrade Jozef Cyrankiewicz, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic：

On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the National Day of the Polish People's Republic, we, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, the government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people, extend our warmest congratulations to you, and through you to the Polish United Workers' Party, the government of the People's Republic of Poland, and the Polish people.

Over the past fifteen years, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish people have achieved great successes in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, which was held not long ago, comprehensively summarized the experiences of the Polish socialist revolution and socialist construction, and adopted the directives for the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965. These directives present a bright future to the Polish people advancing along the socialist road. The Polish people, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, have made positive contributions to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, safeguarding world peace, and guaranteeing European security. The Chinese people are very happy about the great achievements made by the fraternal Polish people.

The Chinese people are deeply convinced that further consolidating and developing the profound friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation in political, economic, cultural and other fields between the people of China and Poland will help our two countries achieve common prosperity and strengthen the unity and cooperation of the socialist camp.

We wish the Polish people new victories in the great cause of socialist construction. May the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Poland last forever.

Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China
    Zhu De, Chairman, Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China
