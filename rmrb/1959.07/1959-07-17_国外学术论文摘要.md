    On Socialist International Division of Labor

To strengthen and improve economic relations between socialist countries, it is necessary for economists from socialist countries to work together to reveal the basic principles of socialist international division of labor.

First, it is necessary to clarify what the concept of socialist international division of labor refers to. Among economists, there is a debate: is international division of labor only related to productive forces, or is it also related to production relations?

In my opinion, international division of labor is a type of social division of labor. It is determined by the development of productive forces and arises directly from the development of productive forces. However, the nature and purpose of international division of labor depend on the system of production relations. Therefore, international division of labor is an economic category.

Abstract international division of labor does not exist. It is necessary to distinguish socialist international division of labor from capitalist international division of labor. Socialist international division of labor is not some ideal of rational organization of production within the socialist camp, not some "model" that we must gradually achieve. Understanding it in this way would be detached from life, detached from the current specific situation, and detached from the tasks arising from this situation.

Socialist international division of labor should be understood as a developing and continuously improving historical process. This process is determined by the specific economic conditions of the countries that currently make up the socialist camp, as well as the fact that these countries joined the international division of labor after the emergence of the world socialist system. Of course, this is related to the rational organization of production within the world socialist system, but the realization of this rational organization must always take into account the current conditions and specific tasks, and never be based on some ideal or "model" that everyone should have.

Socialist international division of labor is a means to achieve a certain goal. This goal is to continuously develop the productive forces of all countries in the socialist camp in order to build a unified material production base for socialism and communism, and to continuously improve the living standards of the people of all socialist countries accordingly. Furthermore, it is to maximize the development of individual socialist countries and their socialist production relations based on this development of production. All of this means maximizing the development of the world system of socialist production relations.

The concrete embodiment of this goal in the current stage of development is to enable the entire socialist camp to complete its basic economic tasks. Because there are some vague ideas on this issue, I want to emphasize that I believe this goal should be understood as follows: all countries in the socialist camp, taken together, must catch up with and surpass all countries in the world capitalist system in terms of absolute production volume. However, in terms of per capita production and consumption, what should be surpassed is not the sum of all capitalist countries (because we socialist countries have already achieved this), but the most developed capitalist countries.

Therefore, the purpose of socialist international division of labor at the present stage is: all socialist countries, taken together, must jointly complete the basic economic tasks of the entire socialist camp, understood in this way, in a very short period of time and with less consumption.

Socialist international division of labor must be seen as a concrete historical process. From this point of view, the main characteristics that should be taken into account when realizing socialist international division of labor are: the countries of the socialist camp are not at the same level of economic development, and they can be roughly divided into two categories: industrially developed countries and industrially less developed countries.

According to the basic economic tasks, it can be seen that it is necessary to ensure the continuous development of the productive forces and living standards of both types of socialist countries at the same time, but the industrially backward socialist countries should accelerate their development within this range.

If we all recognize this extremely important principle: that enabling our entire socialist camp to complete its basic economic tasks is the main purpose of the development of socialist economic relations between countries in the socialist camp, and is the main goal to be achieved by concretely realizing socialist international division of labor, then in this case, the basic method and basic criterion should be to improve productivity and save social labor consumption.

Now our socialist countries have entered a period when we are already talking about the socialist camp surpassing the imperialist camp economically, and the world socialist camp having absolute superiority over the capitalist camp in material terms, that is, not only in terms of the nature of production relations, but also in terms of the level of productive forces.

Completing this task in a very short period of time is the supreme responsibility of the people of all socialist countries. Guaranteeing the economic dominance of the socialist camp will mean that world peace is guaranteed, and that a new era is generated in the historical development of society, which can be marked with the new concept of "socialist encirclement". This will be the transition to the final stage of the gradual victory of communism throughout the world.

    The Ways to Eliminate the Essential Differences Between Town and Country

Marxist classic writers believe that the essential difference between town and country is a concept that reflects the certain nature of social relations between town and country and the level of development of productive forces, technology, and culture. This concept shows that the basis for the development of socialist town and country is the consistency of political and economic interests, and the continuous approximation of these interests. This regularity is determined by the essence of the socialist mode of production, by the necessity of planned and proportional economic development, by the necessity of consistent political interests of all classes, and by the necessity of overcoming the cultural and technical backwardness of the countryside.

The essential differences between town and country can be summarized into three aspects: the difference between the two forms of socialist ownership, the social difference between the working class and the collective farmers, and the difference in the cultural and technical level of urban and rural residents.

Under the socialist system, the functional content of the city, as the center of economy, politics, administration, science, and culture, has fundamentally changed. If in the past the ruling class used these functions to exploit and enslave the countryside, now these functions are used to develop rural productive forces and improve the material and cultural level of farmers. The socialist city is a powerful industrial production organization, which together with the socialist countryside lays the economic foundation for raising the countryside to the political, economic, and cultural living standards of modern cities.

The solution of the task of eliminating the essential differences between town and country means: 1. Further developing the two forms of socialist ownership, and transforming the two forms of ownership into a single communist ownership by gradually changing the collective farm ownership into ownership by the whole people; 2. Changing the existing social class structure, that is, gradually eliminating class differences; 3. Bringing the culture of the countryside to the level of the city; 4. Transforming agricultural labor into a kind of industrial labor; 5. Eliminating the boundaries between town and country in terms of more planned distribution of productive forces, overcoming the one-sidedness of social division of labor, and eliminating the disparity in living conditions. In such a society, the old concepts of "city" and "countryside" that express the social class structure will be eliminated.

The essential difference between town and country is a historically temporary phenomenon, which will disappear with the construction of a communist society. The essential difference between town and country does not refer to all differences between town and country. Differences arising from the nature and natural conditions of industry and agriculture are all non-essential differences. Non-essential differences will still exist in communist society. However, essential differences and non-essential differences are intertwined with each other. The process of eliminating essential differences will largely change non-essential differences.

The ways to eliminate the essential differences between town and country are, generally speaking: developing and consolidating the collective farm and state farm system; bringing the two forms of socialist ownership closer; more rationally distributing productive forces, especially industrial productive forces; transferring agricultural production to the basis of machine industry; transforming agricultural labor into a kind of industrial labor; minimizing agricultural labor; more rationally distributing the population; reorganizing rural public utilities in the urban style; building socialist agricultural cities; enabling the countryside to enjoy the cultural wealth of the past and the present; overcoming the particularity of cities.

The transformation of collective farm ownership into ownership by the whole people is a process of gradually transforming the class of collective farmers. After the elimination of the two forms of ownership, the working class and the peasants will become laborers in a communist society without any social and economic differences.

The elimination of the essential differences between town and country must be seen as a two-way process. The thorough approximation of town and country not only means that the countryside should overcome its long-term backwardness in economy, technology, and culture, but also means that modern cities should change their appearance. Under the communist system, industrial, cultural, educational, and scientific and artistic centers cannot all be concentrated in a few cities, because this would narrow the possibility of various residents widely using cultural and artistic achievements.

The rapid increase of new cities, industrial centers, and cultural centers in the Soviet Union has overcome the superiority of old cities. These new centers are the prototypes of future cities, which will be distributed more densely and closer to the rural residents. There is no doubt that this process will eliminate the boundaries between urban residents and rural residents, and will change the distribution of our country's population.

    Attaching Importance to the Social Evaluation of the Economy and the Study of Proportions in the National Economy

Under the current conditions of communist construction, the most important issues among all issues of economic science are: the issue of social evaluation of production consumption and the results of economic activities, and the issue of proportions in the national economy.

Under the socialist system, the principle of saving social labor consumption is the basis of social evaluation. Determining the amount of socially necessary labor consumption as the essence of value is by no means a statistical calculation of the usual average actual labor consumption, but a complex economic calculation, which should also take into account the changes in the various stages and labor conditions that the product has gone through in the process of expanded reproduction.

Among Soviet economists, there was a saying that value was unknowable for a long time, and that even rough calculations were impossible. "Value agnosticism" no longer exists. The current practical task is to carry out relevant economic calculations.

Determining social value is very necessary when formulating a scientifically based planned price system. A price theory that is divorced from value cannot withstand any criticism. The urgent task facing Soviet economists is to establish a theory of planned prices. Many elements of this theory are already available, but a unified, structurally rigorous, and universally recognized theory has not yet been formulated. Comrade Khrushchev has set out the following basic requirements for planned prices: prices should be both stable, flexible, and appropriately differentiated at the same time. Under our country's current conditions, planned prices are one of the important standards of the national economy. Relying on this standard, each state-owned enterprise and collective farm enterprise can make itself a profitable enterprise according to the principle of economic accounting.

When formulating a planned price system, it is required to carry out complex economic calculations of truly socially necessary labor consumption, various balance calculations (balance sheets of residents' income and expenditure, balance sheets of production expenditure and output), calculations that coordinate intermediate product and final product prices (taking into account the complex connections in production that occur with expenditure material costs), and calculations to solve the task of best utilizing labor objects and labor tools, and maximizing the saving of living labor.

The issues of value and planned prices are central issues in the evaluation of the national economy. The task of raising social labor productivity, which is a decisive standard of the national economy, is closely related to the issue of social value.

The economic effects of investment and the adoption of new technologies also belong to the scope of national economic evaluation standards.

The study of the proportional system of the national economy is linked to the study of the following important issues, such as the issues of socialist expanded reproduction and national economic balance sheets; the issues of social division of labor and the specialization, collaboration, and combination of production; the issues of rational distribution of social production and the comprehensive development of various economic regions.

Soviet economic science studies the proportions of the national economy in the changes of the proportions of the national economy.

In the Soviet economy, the necessary proportions of the national economy are largely guaranteed by the establishment of various social funds, such as depreciation funds, investment, wage surcharges, social security and social insurance funds, collective farm public funds, fixed funds and circulating funds of state-owned enterprises, collective farm reserve funds, material expenses, wages, enterprise funds, budget profit sharing, business tax, unified material supply fund, total amount of daily necessities, etc.

The economic budget of a socialist society should become an organic part of the unified national economic balance sheet. The balance sheet of social product production and distribution is a comprehensive document of national statistics and calculations, while the economic budget is a comprehensive document of socialist society bookkeeping. The economic budget of socialist society and the balance sheet of social product production and distribution are two forms of socialist state economic table. The basis of these two balance sheets is the table of Marxist-Leninist expanded reproduction, which has been concretized to adapt to modern economic conditions.

Closely related to the main issues of social production distribution is the development of the socialist world system and the cooperation of socialist countries.

The issue of improving national economic planning is a particularly urgent issue. The concrete application of Marxist-Leninist principles in the management and organization of the socialist economy is the common scientific basis for implementing planned economy and national economic planning. At the same time, the principles and methods of socialist national economic planning leadership, the principles and methods of planning data, the principles and methods of economic accounting and planning calculation, and the technology and mechanization of calculation should all be theoretically summarized and demonstrated.

    国外学术论文摘要
  “学术译丛”1959年第7期今日出版，下面是其中三篇译文的摘要。
    论社会主义国际分工
    为了加强和改善社会主义国家之间的经济关系，就需要社会主义国家的经济学家共同努力来揭示社会主义国际分工的基本原则。
    首先必须弄清楚社会主义国际分工这个概念指的是什么。在经济学家当中有这样的争论：国际分工仅仅同生产力有关呢，还是也同生产关系有关呢？
    在我看来，国际分工是社会分工的一种，它是由生产力的发展决定的，是直接从生产力的发展中产生的。但是国际分工的性质、它的目的则取决于生产关系体系。因此，国际分工是经济范畴。
    抽象的国际分工是不存在的。必须把社会主义国际分工同资本主义国际分工区别开来。社会主义国际分工不是社会主义阵营生产的合理组织的某种理想，不是我们必须逐步达到的某种“样本”，如果这样理解，那就会脱离生活，脱离当前的具体情况，脱离由这种情况产生的任务。
    应当把社会主义国际分工理解为发展着的、不断完善的历史过程，这个过程决定于今天组成社会主义阵营的各个国家的具体经济情况，也决定于世界社会主义体系产生之后这些国家加入国际分工的事实。当然，这同世界社会主义体系生产的合理组织有关，但是实现这种合理组织必须经常考虑到当前的条件和具体任务，而决不是根据什么大家都应有的某种理想或“样本”。
    社会主义国际分工是达到一定目的的手段。这个目的就是不断发展社会主义阵营各国的生产力，以建成社会主义和共产主义的统一的物质生产基础，并相应地不断提高所有社会主义国家人民的生活水平，此外就是根据生产的这种发展来最大限度地发展个别社会主义国家以及它们之间的社会主义生产关系。所有这一切意味着最大限度地发展社会主义生产关系的世界体系。
    这个目的在目前发展阶段的具体体现，就是使整个社会主义阵营完成基本经济任务。因为在这个问题上也有某些模糊观念，所以我着重指出，我认为这个目的应当这样理解，就是社会主义阵营所有国家合在一起，必须在绝对生产量方面赶上和超过世界资本主义体系的一切国家。但是在按人口平均计算的生产和消费方面应该超过的不是所有资本主义国家的总和（因为我们社会主义国家现在已经做到这一点），而是最发达的资本主义国家。
    因此现阶段社会主义国际分工的目的就是：所有社会主义国家合在一起，要在极短时期内并且以较少的消耗来共同完成这样理解的整个社会主义阵营的基本经济任务。
    必须把社会主义国际分工看作具体的历史过程。从这个观点出发，在实现社会主义国际分工时应当估计到的主要特点就是：社会主义阵营各国不是处在同样的经济发展水平，它们大体上可以分成两类：工业发达的国家和工业不大发达的国家。
    根据基本经济任务可以看出，必须保证两类社会主义国家的生产力和人民生活水平同时不断发展，但是工业落后的社会主义国家应该在这个范围内加速度地发展。
    如果我们都承认这一极重要的原则：使我们整个社会主义阵营完成基本经济任务是社会主义阵营各国之间社会主义经济关系发展的主要目的，是具体实现社会主义国际分工所要达到的主要目的，那么在这种情况下，基本方法和基本准绳应该是提高生产率和节约社会劳动的消耗。
    现在我们社会主义国家已进入这样的时期，这时要谈的已经是社会主义阵营在经济上超过帝国主义阵营的问题，是世界社会主义阵营在物质方面，即不仅在生产关系的性质方面，而且也在生产力水平方面，对资本主义阵营占绝对优势的问题。
    在极短时期内完成这个任务，是所有社会主义国家人民的最高职责。保证社会主义阵营在经济上占优势，将意味着世界和平得到保障，意味着社会的历史发展中产生一个可以用新的概念“社会主义包围”来标志的新纪元。这将是向共产主义在全世界逐渐胜利的最后阶段的过渡。

      消灭城乡本质差别的途径
    马克思主义经典著作家认为，城乡的本质差别是反映城乡之间社会关系的一定性质以及反映生产力、技术和文化发展水平的一种概念。这种概念表明，社会主义城乡发展的基础是政治利益和经济利益的一致，是这些利益的不断接近。这个规律性是由社会主义生产方式的本质所决定的，是由经济有计划、按比例发展的必要性、各阶级政治利益一致的必要性以及克服农村文化技术落后状况的必要性所决定的。
    城乡本质差别可以归结为三个方面，即两种社会主义所有制形式的差别，工人阶级和集体农民的社会差别，城乡居民文化技术水平的差别。
    在社会主义制度下，作为经济、政治、行政、科学、文化中心的城市，它的职能内容根本改变了。如果说过去统治阶级利用这些职能剥削和奴役农村，那么，现在这些职能却被利用来发展农村生产力，提高农民的物质和文化水平。社会主义的城市是强大的工业生产机构，它同社会主义农村在一起为把农村提高到现代城市的政治、经济、文化生活水平奠定经济基础。
    消灭城乡本质差别这一任务的解决意味着：1、进一步发展两种社会主义所有制形式，通过集体农庄所有制逐步变成全民所有制的办法把两种所有制形式变为单一的共产主义所有制；2、现存的社会阶级结构的改变，即阶级差别的逐步消灭；3、农村的文化达到城市的水平；4、农业劳动变为一种工业劳动；5、在更有计划地分布生产力、克服社会分工的片面性、消灭生活条件悬殊现象等方面消灭城乡界限。在这样的社会里，表现社会阶级结构的
  “城市”和“乡村”的旧概念将会消灭。
    城乡本质差别是历史上暂时的现象，它将随着共产主义社会的建成而消灭。城乡的本质差别不是指城乡间的一切差别。由工业和农业的本质和自然条件产生的差别，都属于非本质的差别。非本质的差别，在共产主义社会还会存在。但是，本质差别和非本质差别彼此之间是交织在一起的。消灭本质差别的过程，在很大程度上会改变非本质的差别。
    消灭城乡本质差别的途径，大体上说来就是：发展和巩固集体农庄和国营农场制度；使两种社会主义所有制形式接近；更合理地分布生产力，特别是工业生产力；把农业生产转到机器工业的基础上；把农业劳动变成一种工业劳动；最大限度地减轻农业劳动；更合理地分布人口；按城市方式改组农村公用事业；建设社会主义农业城市；使农村能享受过去和现在的文化财富；克服城市的特殊性。
    集体农庄所有制变为全民所有制，是集体农民这一阶级逐步得到改造的一个过程。在两种所有制形式消灭之后，工人阶级和农民将变为没有任何社会经济差别的共产主义社会的劳动者。
    城乡本质差别的消灭必须看成是两方面的过程。城乡的彻底接近，不仅意味着农村应克服自己在经济、技术、文化方面的长期落后状态，而且意味着现代城市应该改变自己的面貌。在共产主义制度下，工业、文化教育和科学艺术中心不能都集中在少数城市里，因为这会缩小各个居民阶层广泛利用文化艺术成果的可能性。
    苏联新城市、工业中心和文化中心的迅速增加，克服了旧城市的优越地位。这些新的中心是未来城市的雏型，未来的城市将分布得更稠密更接近农村居民群众。毫无疑问，这个过程将消灭城市居民和乡村居民的界限，将改变我国人口分布的情况。

    重视经济的社会评价和国民经济比例的研究
    在当前的共产主义建设条件下，在经济科学的一切问题中占首要地位的问题是：对生产消耗和经济活动成果的社会评价问题以及国民经济比例的问题。
    在社会主义制度下，节约社会劳动消耗的原则是社会评价的基础。确定作为价值实质的社会必要劳动消耗量决不是通常的平均实际劳动消耗的统计计算，而是复杂的经济计算，进行这种计算还应估计到在扩大再生产过程中生产该产品所经过的各个阶段和劳动条件发生的变化。
    在苏联经济学家中，过去长时间内流行着一种说法，仿佛价值是不可知的，即使作大体的计算，也是不可能的。“价值不可知论”已经不存在了，现在的实际任务是进行有关的经济计算。
    在制定有科学根据的计划价格体系时，确定社会价值，是非常必要的。脱离价值的价格理论是经不起任何批评的。苏联经济学家面临的迫切任务是建立计划价格的理论。这个理论的许多要素都已具备，只是现在还没有制定出统一的结构严整的公认的理论。赫鲁晓夫同志对计划价格已经定出下列基本要求：价格应该同时既是稳定的，又是灵活的和有适当的差别的。在我国当前的条件下，计划价格是国民经济的重要标准之一，依靠这一标准，每个国营企业和集体农庄企业就可以根据经济核算制的原则使自己成为盈利的企业。
    在制定计划价格体系时，就要求进行确是社会必要劳动消耗的复杂的经济计算、各种平衡计算（居民收支平衡表、生产支出和产量平衡表），使中间产品和最终产品价格相互协调的计算（估计到支出材料费用所发生的生产上的错综复杂的联系），以及为解决最好地利用劳动对象和劳动工具、最大限度地节约活劳动的任务而进行的计算。
    价值和计划价格问题是国民经济评价方面的中心问题。提高社会劳动生产率这一具有决定意义的国民经济标准的任务，是同社会价值问题有着密切联系的。
    属于国民经济评价标准范围的还有投资的经济效果和采用新技术问题。
    对国民经济的比例体系的研究是同下列这些重要问题的研究有联系的，如，社会主义扩大再生产和国民经济平衡表问题；社会分工以及生产的专业化、协作化和联合化问题；社会生产的合理分布和各经济区的综合发展问题。
    苏联经济科学是在国民经济比例的变化中来研究国民经济比例的。
    在苏联的经济中，必要的国民经济比例，在很大程度上，是通过建立各种社会基金来保证的，如，折旧基金、投资、工资附加额、社会保证和社会保险基金、集体农庄公共基金、国营企业的固定基金和流动基金、集体农庄公积金、材料费用、工资、企业基金、预算利润提成、营业税、物资统一供应基金、日用品总额等等。
    社会主义社会的经济预算应该成为统一的国民经济平衡表的有机部分。社会产品生产分配平衡表是国家统计和计算的综合文件，而经济预算则是社会主义社会簿记的综合文件。社会主义社会经济预算和社会产品生产分配平衡表是社会主义国家经济表的两种形式。这两个平衡表的基础，是适应现代经济条件而具体化了的马克思列宁主义扩大再生产的表式。
    同社会生产分布的主要问题有密切联系的，是社会主义世界体系的发展和社会主义国家的协作问题。
    改进国民经济计划的问题是特别迫切的问题。马列主义原理在社会主义经济的管理和组织方面的具体运用，是实行计划经济和国民经济计划工作的共同的科学基础。同时，社会主义国民经济计划领导的原则和方法，计划资料的原则和方法，经济计算和计划计算的原则和方法，以及计算的技术和机械化等都应该在理论上加以总结和论证。
