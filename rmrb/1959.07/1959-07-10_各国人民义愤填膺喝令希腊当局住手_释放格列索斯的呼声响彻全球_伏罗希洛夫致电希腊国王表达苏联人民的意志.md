Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The actions of the Greek authorities in illegally persecuting the fearless fighter for peace and democracy, Glezos, and others have aroused increasingly widespread protests, and calls for the immediate release of Glezos are resounding throughout the world.

Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, said in a letter to King Paul I of Greece on the 9th that Soviet public opinion is deeply disturbed by the threat to the life and freedom of Glezos, a progressive Greek social activist and national hero.

The letter said that out of humanitarian considerations, I feel obliged to bring to your attention the opinion of the Soviet public and ask you to take measures to release Glezos.

The letter pointed out that the Soviet people, who shed blood together with the Greek people in the struggle against the fascist bandits, are well acquainted with the name of Glezos. In the struggle for the freedom and independence of the motherland, Glezos gloriously fulfilled his strength.

The letter said that many Soviet social organizations and trade union organizations, cultural workers, scientists, Soviet citizens, and foreign citizens have written letters to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, requesting them to help relieve the threat to Glezos's life and secure his freedom.

The Soviet Peace Committee, the Soviet Veterans Committee, the Soviet Women's Committee, the Soviet Youth Organizations Committee, and the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries have recently received letters and telegrams from social organizations, citizens, enterprises, and institutions expressing their determination to safeguard the life of the heroic anti-fascist fighter Glezos.

Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, sent telegrams to the Greek government and the Athens Military Tribunal on the 7th, protesting the Greek authorities' submission of the Greek patriot Glezos to the Athens Military Tribunal for trial, and demanding the restoration of the freedom of this Greek national hero and peace fighter.

The Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Greek government on the 7th, resolutely condemning the Greek authorities' trial of Glezos by a military tribunal on behalf of the Mongolian working class and all trade union members, and demanding the release of this Greek national hero.

The Romanian Committee for the Defense of Glezos, the National Peace Committee, the Central Council of Trade Unions, the National Student Union, the Journalists Association, and other organizations have sent telegrams to the Greek government protesting the persecution of Glezos and other patriots.

The Bulgarian Committee for the Defense of Glezos issued an appeal to world public opinion on the 7th, resolutely protesting the trial of Glezos and firmly demanding an end to the illegal persecution of Glezos and his immediate release.

The Greek Lawyers Association protested against the Greek authorities' application of Law No. 375. The famous Greek jurist Vamvetsos said that referring Glezos's case to a military tribunal "caused great damage to Greece's reputation."

Venizelos, the leader of the Liberal Party, one of Greece's largest bourgeois parties, said that the Liberal Party has been demanding the abolition of Article "375 (the military tribunal that tried Glezos was formed according to this law) for the past five years. Venizelos said: "I believe that the case of 'Dawn Daily' editor Glezos and other defendants should be tried by a civil court." Mizotakis, a famous activist of this party, also said that it is unconstitutional to hand Glezos over to a military court.

Famous Greek political activists Mavros, Allamanis, and Athanasiadis-Novas also issued a joint statement advocating the abolition of Law No. 375, which harms national interests.
