	Milk Powder: Milk is heated and sterilized, and the water is removed while maintaining its vitamins. This turns it into a powder, which is milk powder. It retains the nutritional value of the original milk and contains large amounts of protein, fat, lactose, and vitamins.

	Cream: Fat is extracted from milk using centrifugal force, then heated to sterilize it, and finally stirred with a mixer. It is pure in quality and has extremely rich nutritional value, making it an easily digestible nutritious product.

	Casein: Milk that has had its fat removed is acidified or enzymes are added to coagulate the casein, which is then dehydrated, washed, crushed, and dried to become casein. It is a pale yellow or white granule. It is a raw material in industry, indispensable in industries such as plastics manufacturing, leather making, papermaking, electrical materials, and textiles.

	Condensed Milk: Fresh milk is cleared of impurities, then heated and sterilized to become thick. It contains protein, fat, lactose, minerals, and vitamins. It has extremely rich nutritional value, can be eaten directly, and can be used to process high-end foods.

	Lactose: The whey remaining after casein production is heated and neutralized with soda ash or lime water, filtered, and then evaporated until it dries into lumps. Finally, it is crushed and dried to become a pale yellow or white crystalline powder.

    你知道牛奶出哪些产品吗？
    乳粉　牛奶经加热灭菌，在保持其维生素的情况下除去水分，使它变成粉状，这就是乳粉。它保有原牛乳的营养价值，含有大量蛋白质、脂肪、乳糖和维生素。
    奶油　是用离心力量从牛乳中提取脂肪，经过加热杀菌后，用搅拌器搅拌而成。它的品质纯洁，有极丰富的营养价值，是容易消化的营养品。
    酪胶　除去脂肪的牛奶，加酸或加酵素使酪蛋白凝固脱水洗涤粉碎干燥就成为酪胶。它是淡黄色或白色颗粒。它是工业中的原料，如制塑料、制革、造纸、电料、纺织等工业都不能缺少它。
    炼乳　新牛奶去掉杂质以后，再加热杀菌，变成稠状，它含有蛋白质、脂肪、乳糖、矿物质和维生素。有极丰富的营养价值，可以直接食用，并可加工高级食品。
    乳糖　制完酪胶后剩下的乳清水加热用纯碱或石灰水中和，过滤后，一直蒸发到干成块状，最后粉碎干燥就成为淡黄色或白色结晶粉末。乳糖是医药中最主要的原料，可制链霉素、药用乳糖、乳酸等。
    牛奶酱油是乳蛋白和盐酸、纯碱、甘草膏、食盐和酱色制成。它含有大量的蛋白质，有很大营养价值，同时味美可口，用它拌凉菜和炒菜均可。　（沙俊）
