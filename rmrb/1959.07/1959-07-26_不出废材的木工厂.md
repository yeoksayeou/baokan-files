Zhuzhou, this vigorously developing industrial city, has countless units requesting doors, windows, wallboards, furniture, utensils... from the wood factory every day. The Zhuzhou Wood Factory not only has to meet the needs of the city, but also has to take care of orders from within the province and from far-flung places like East and North China. This year, the demand for wood products is even greater, and the supply of wood is somewhat tight. Under these circumstances, the movement for wood conservation among the wood factory's workers is becoming even more fervent.

The assembly line workshops are like layers of checkpoints, intercepting every usable piece of wood and preventing them from slipping away easily.

The workers guarding the first checkpoint—the cutoff saw workshop—always carefully calculate when sawing each piece of wood, according to the type and specifications of the product, and then make the cut. "The cutoff saw is like a tailor's scissors." Yuan Zhenkun, a team leader in this workshop, told us, "Whether the cut is good or bad, whether there is conservation or waste, our checkpoint is the most important. If we truly achieve 'custom tailoring,' we can save a lot of wood each month."

After the wood is cut, it is sent to the sawing team for processing, which is the second checkpoint. Here, people have adopted advanced production methods such as "cross-section design" and "rational utilization of dull edges." Often, a piece of wood could only be sawn into one square piece in the past, but by appropriately including a dull edge, it can be sawn into two qualified pieces.

Once the pieces are sawn out, it depends on how the material allocation team uses them more rationally. There's a rhyme in the workshop: "Wood is like gold, use it carefully, if you don't pay attention, wasting it is a sin." Liu Meisheng, the material allocation team leader, painfully talked about the situation in the wood factory a few years ago: At that time, the factory was piled high with wood, and the people using the material always picked and chose, throwing away edges and short pieces everywhere, and even selling good materials as firewood.

In February of this year, the factory launched a clean-up of the factory site and utilization of waste materials campaign. In just fourteen days, they cleared out more than seventy cubic meters of useful materials. Now, the phenomenon of discarding wood randomly is no longer seen in the factory. Their new material allocation principle is to use scrap small pieces as regular material as much as possible, while ensuring product quality. The remaining materials that cannot be used as material are used for packaging boxes; the next grade of material is planed into wood wool, mixed with cement, and then pressed and dried by an oil press to make wood wool boards for construction, which can insulate and soundproof; sawdust can also be mixed with some pig blood or bean glue, and then hot-pressed to make particleboard to replace hardwood for table tops. Short pieces of hardwood are made into various toys and tool handles...

The workers are actively using their brains to find ways to conserve. Bao Genmou of the round wood workshop, a worker who has been doing round wood work for more than ten years, has always followed the teachings of his master in the past, always splitting the wood with a knife. The split pieces were not neat, and splitting into straight pieces had to be shaved round, wasting a lot of material. On the night when the leaders called on the workers to utilize 100% of the wood, he recalled what he had personally witnessed while working in the forest area in 1953: Not to mention how many years it takes for a tree to grow into a piece of timber, just transporting a piece of timber out of the deep mountains and forests, and then shipping it through small streams and large rivers to the city construction site, takes an unknown amount of sweat! Can the method of splitting round wood with a knife remain unchanged? No. After racking his brains, he cleverly added a semi-circular backboard to the band saw, and later ran to the scrap yard to find an iron bucket and made a circular saw to replace the method of splitting wood with a knife. In this way, the material yield increased by 30%.

How many people are actively using their brains to find solutions? It's more than just a few or dozens! In the past, the wood comprehensive utilization workshop always used pine round wood as regular material to plane into wood wool boards. Ding Dahong, the party branch secretary and workers of this workshop, studied together for several days, and finally created a charging box attached to the planing board. In the past, wood of 3×5 cm or more was required to plane wool, but now edges of 1×1 cm can also be planed into wool.

Under the slogan of "no waste of wood in the factory, small materials play a big role," the entire factory is striving to save wood. From January to May of this year, the output value increased by 160.15% compared with the same period last year, while the wood entering the factory decreased by 24.33%, saving the country more than 1,700 cubic meters of wood.

    不出废材的木工厂
    邹升恒
    株洲，这个蓬勃发展着的工业城市，每天不知有多少单位向木工厂要门、窗、板壁、家具、器皿……。株洲木工厂不但要满足本市的需要，还要照顾省内和来自华东、华北的远道订货。今年，木制品需要量更大了，木材的供应显得有些紧张。就在这种形势下，木工厂职工节约木材的运动开展得更红火了。
    流水式的作业车间，就像重重关卡，截住了每一块可用的木材，不让它们轻轻溜过。
    把守头关——断锯车间的工人们，在锯断每一根木材的时候，总是按照产品种类、规格，经过仔细计算，然后下锯。“断锯好比裁缝师傅的剪刀一样。”这个车间的一个组长袁振坤同志告诉我们，“剪好剪坏，节约浪费，我们这一关最重要。如果真正做到了‘量体裁衣’，每个月便可以节约很多木材。”
    木材断好后，送到锯木组制材，这是第二关。在这里，人们采用了“断面设计”、“合理利用钝棱”等先进生产方法。往往一块木料，原来只能锯一根四面见方的料子，适当带点钝边，就可以锯成两根合格的料子。
    料子锯了出来，就要看配料组如何更合理地使用了。车间里有首顺口溜：“木材像黄金，使用要认真，若要不注意，浪费是罪人。”配料组长刘梅生痛心地谈起了木工厂早几年的情景：那时候，厂子里木材堆积如山，用料的人总是挑肥选瘦，边皮、短筒子到处乱丢，好材料有时也当柴火出卖。
    今年2月间，厂子里来了一次清理厂地利用废料运动，仅仅十四天时间，就清理出有用材料七十多立方米。现在，厂子里再也看不到乱丢木料的现象了。他们新的配料原则，是在保证产品质量的前提下，尽量利用下脚小料作正材用。不成料的余材，便利用作包装箱；再次的就刨成木丝，和水泥搅拌后，经过油压机压制、烘干，制成建筑用的木丝板，可以保温、隔音；木屑也可以拌和一些猪血或豆胶，经过热压制成木屑板，代替硬杂木做台面板用。短小的硬杂木，就做成各种玩具、工具柄……
    工人们积极开动脑筋，千方百计寻求节约门路。圆木车间包根谋，这个搞了十多年圆木工手艺的工人，过去一直遵循师傅的传授，总是用刀劈木料，劈出的木块不整齐，而且劈成直块又要削圆，浪费很多材料。在领导号召职工百分之百地利用木材的当天晚上，他回忆起1953年自己在林区里做工亲眼看到的情景：且不说长成一根木材要多少年，就是从深山密林里搬运一根木材出山，再经过小溪大河流送到城市工地，便不知要流多少汗！刀劈圆木这个方法不改变还行吗？不行。经过他穷思苦想，在带锯极上巧妙地加了个半圆靠板，后来又跑到废料库里找到一个铁桶，做成圆形锯，代替用刀劈料的办法。就这样，出材率提高了30％。
    积极开动脑筋想办法的人又何止几个、几十个呢！这个厂木材综合利用车间过去都是拿松圆木正材去刨丝做木丝板。这个车间的党支部书记、工人丁大宏和组内工人一道研究了好几天，最后创造了一种装料盒，附加在刨丝板上。原来要3×5公分以上的木料才能刨丝，现在1×1公分的边皮也能刨丝了。
    全厂职工在“要厂内木材无废料，叫小材发挥大作用”的口号下，努力节约木材。今年1月到5月份比去年同时期产值增长了160.15％，而进厂木材却减少24.33％，为国家节约木材一千七百立方米以上。（附图片）
