Nine Cities Vigorously Collect Waste Materials
More than 360,000 Tons Recycled
Value of 180 Million Yuan
(Our Newspaper) According to the principle of "grasping both big and small, taking into account both primary and secondary aspects, making overall arrangements, and achieving effective results," major cities across the country vigorously carried out waste product recycling work in the first half of this year, combined with the spring and summer patriotic health campaigns and the clearing of warehouses by factories and mines, achieving remarkable results. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Commerce for nine cities including Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Harbin, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Changsha, and Luoyang, from January to May, more than 360,000 tons of various waste materials have been recycled, with a value of more than 180 million yuan.

After commercial departments in various regions acquired a large amount of waste products, in addition to allocating a portion of the state-controlled first and second category materials according to state plans, the vast majority of materials were supplied to factories and enterprises as raw materials through the method of "collecting, processing, transporting, and supplying simultaneously." For example, as of June 10, Tianjin had supplied factories and enterprises with more than 73,800 tons of various industrial raw materials, of which more than 17,000 tons of various papermaking raw materials were supplied to eight paper mills including Renmin and Xinhua, accounting for about 70% of the papermaking raw materials required by these factories. In order to ensure that all waste products are "used to their full potential, regardless of size," Nanjing organized workers from more than 100 daily necessities factories and handicraft cooperatives to select materials in warehouses, strongly supporting the production of these factories. Various regions also extracted chemical raw materials from various scattered waste materials, scraps, swill, and sludge to support industrial production. In Shanghai, five months were used to extract 82 tons of liquid caustic soda, 666 *jin* of silver nitrate, 846 tons of sodium sulfate, 996 tons of alkali, and 714 tons of potassium from chemical raw material scraps; more than 1,000 tons of various animal oils, vegetable oils, and mineral oils were extracted from swill, waste oil scraps, and sewer mud; they also used waste fixer solution to extract more than 1,400 *liang* of silver and replicate 2,835 gallons of regenerated fixer solution. In order to solve the needs of industrial and commercial departments for packaging containers, commercial departments in various regions have also vigorously strengthened the repair of waste packaging containers.

Commercial departments in various regions have also processed, replicated, and repaired some of the waste materials that are people's daily necessities, turning waste into new and useless into useful, which not only increased social wealth but also supplied consumer needs. In Beijing, 36,342 pairs of various shoes, 3,560 stoves, 954 iron kettles, and 1,235 children's cars were repaired in five months; in Luoyang, more than 2,300 kinds of refurbished and replicated commodities were also produced using waste materials in five months, with a value of more than 2.8 million yuan.

Various regions have come up with many ways to facilitate residents' sale of waste products. Some regions have helped residents set up "treasure chests" to collect waste products in daily life and sell them regularly. Some regions have established street resident waste product purchasing stations or set up purchasing points in comprehensive stores to expand the waste product recycling network; various regions have also organized a large number of mobile purchasing groups to go deep into the neighborhoods and purchase door-to-door. Purchasing points have also been widely established in enterprises, institutions, and schools. Various regions have also correctly implemented the policy of "pricing according to quality" and "pricing waste and old separately" in the purchase of waste products. (Attached picture)

    大材大用  小材小用  物尽其用
    九城市大收废旧物资
    回收三十六万多吨
    价值一亿八千万元
    本报讯　今年上半年全国各大中城市根据“大小都抓，主次兼顾，统筹安排，各收其效”的方针，结合春夏季爱国卫生运动和厂矿企业的清理仓库，大力开展废品回收工作，获得显著成绩。据商业部对上海、天津、沈阳、武汉、哈尔滨、南京、广州、长沙、洛阳等九个城市的不完全统计，1月至5月份已经回收各种废旧物资三十六万多吨，价值一亿八千多万元。
    各地商业部门在收购到大量废品后，除去对一部分国家统一掌握的一、二类物资按照国家计划调拨外，绝大部分物资都采取“随收购、随加工、随调运、随供应”的办法，供给各工厂企业作了原料。如天津市到6月10日统计，已经供应工厂企业各种工业原料七万三千八百多吨，其中仅供应人民、新华等八个造纸厂的各种造纸原料就有一万七千多吨，占这些工厂所需造纸原料的70％左右。南京市为了使所有废品做到“大材大用，小材小用，物尽其用”，组织了一百多家日用品工厂和手工业社的工人进仓挑选，有力地支援了这些工厂的生产。各地还从各种零星废料、下脚、泔水、污泥中提炼化工原料支援工业生产。上海市五个月中利用化工原料下脚提制出液体烧碱八十二吨，硝酸银六百六十六市斤，硫酸钠八百四十六吨，碱类九百九十六吨，钾类七百一十四吨；利用泔水、废油下脚及阴沟泥，提炼各种动物油、植物油和矿油一千多吨；他们还利用废定影液，提取白银一千四百多两，复制再生定影液二千八百三十五加仑。为了解决工、商业部门对包装容器的需要，各地商业部门又大力加强了废旧包装容器的整修工作。
    各地商业部门还把废旧物资中的一部分人民日常生活用品，经过加工、复制和整修，使废旧变崭新，无用变有用，既增加了社会财富，又供给了消费者需要。北京市5个月中整修各种鞋子三万六千三百四十二双，火炉三千五百六十个，铁壶九百五十四个，儿童车一千二百三十五辆；洛阳市5个月中利用废旧物资翻新复制的商品也有二千三百多种，价值二百八十多万元。
    各地想出了很多办法便利居民出售废品，有些地区帮助居民设立“聚宝箱”，将日常生活中的废品集攒起来，定期出售。有些地区建立了街道居民废品代购站或在综合商店设立代购点，扩大了废品回收网；各地还组织大批流动收购组，深入里弄，挨门逐户收购。在企业、机关、学校中也广泛建立代购点。各地在收购废品中还正确地贯彻了“按质论价”和“废旧分价”的政策。（附图片）
