Hunan: More Than 3,000 People Go Up the Mountains, Listing Pine Resin Production as an Important Task
Heilongjiang Holds On-Site Resin Collection Conference to Exchange Technical Experience

    (Our report) Hunan Province is seizing the pine resin collection season and actively organizing manpower to collect pine resin. In Shaoyang and Qianyang prefectures, where pine resin production is relatively good, more than 3,400 workers had already gone up the mountains to collect resin by the beginning of June, and they are prepared to continue drawing labor and making comprehensive plans for the labor needed for resin collection. Some areas have also fixed and replenished resin collection cadres, assigning resin collection tasks to counties, communes, and teams, and signing contracts. Changde and other new resin collection areas are also actively carrying out resin collection work through pilot projects. According to incomplete statistics from early June, more than 3,700 workers have already gone up the mountains across the province, and more than 200 tons of the produced pine resin has been inspected and accepted.

    In order to further improve resin collection work and ensure the completion of pine rosin and turpentine production tasks, the Provincial Forestry Department recently instructed forestry bureaus in all prefectures and autonomous prefectures to further make arrangements, requiring forestry departments at all levels to strengthen specific leadership over pine resin production. While arranging bamboo and timber production and afforestation work, pine resin production should be listed as a task that must be completed. Regions that have already been assigned tasks should be inspected to ensure that plans are implemented. Regions that have not been assigned tasks, especially those that will be carrying out logging this year and old resin collection areas, should quickly arrange labor, with the support of Party committees at all levels, to help people's communes organize professional resin collection teams to collect resin on the mountains. They should also strengthen technical guidance for professional teams and reasonably resolve distribution issues in accordance with the principle of "distribution according to work." In production, it is necessary to implement the policy of combining resin collection with logging, vigorously carry out technical innovation, promote advanced experience, and launch the "high yield, high quality, high labor efficiency" Three Highs competition to ensure the completion and over-completion of pine resin tasks.

    (Our report) The Heilongjiang Provincial Forestry Department and Commercial Department jointly held an on-site pine rosin production conference in the Wuying area of Yichun at the end of June. Yang Yichen, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governor, attended the meeting and spoke, calling on employees to overcome difficulties and complete the pine rosin production plan in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way.

    The meeting exchanged the experience of the forestry and commercial departments in the Wuying area in jointly promoting pine rosin production, calling on forestry departments to mobilize all positive factors and vigorously carry out pine rosin production. The commercial departments should fully supply the tools needed for pine rosin production, further strengthen cooperation, and ensure the completion of this year's pine rosin production plan.

    The meeting pointed out that July and August are the key seasons for pine rosin production in Heilongjiang Province, so it is necessary to widely organize professional and amateur resin collection teams to seize time, seize the initiative, and strive to be the best, ensuring an ample supply of raw materials for pine rosin production.

    (Another report) In order to expand pine rosin production and meet the needs of national production and people's lives, the Yichun City Forestry Department and Commercial Department in Heilongjiang Province cooperated to organize a pine rosin professional production team of more than 400 people to enter the mountains for production.

    Under the leadership of the municipal Party committee, the forestry and commercial departments cooperated, dividing labor and increasing production and income. The commercial department is responsible for tool supply through tracking and purchasing, and the forestry department is responsible for mobilizing workers to carry out amateur production. At present, the workers have high enthusiasm for production. Li Chengnian, a worker from the Shangganling Forestry Bureau, adopted the method of "picking up sheep along the way" without affecting timber production, and collected 15 jin of pine resin in five days. From the second quarter to June 25, the Fenglin Forestry Bureau alone hung more than 12,000 resin collectors and collected more than 3,700 jin of pine resin. Shangganling, Meixi, Fenglin, Shuangzihe, Youhao, Yidong and other forestry bureaus have extracted more than three tons of high-quality pine rosin by adopting indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods. By late June, the city had collected more than 16 tons of pine resin.

    抓紧季节多采松脂
    湖南三千多人上山把松脂生产列为重要任务
    黑龙江召开采脂现场会议交流生产技术经验
    本报讯　湖南省正抓紧松脂采集季节，积极组织力量采集松脂。松脂生产情况较好的邵阳、黔阳两个专区，6月初已有三千四百多工人上山采脂，并且准备继续抽调劳动力，对采脂所需要的劳动力作全面的计划安排。部分地区还固定和充实了采脂干部，将采脂任务布置到县、到社、到队，签订了合同。常德等新采脂区也正在通过试点，积极开展采脂工作。据6月上旬的不完全统计，全省已有三千七百多工人上山，生产出的松脂经过验收已有二百多吨。
    为了进一步作好采脂工作，保证松香、松节油生产任务的完成，省林业厅最近已布置各专区、自治州林业局进一步作好安排，要求各级林业部门加强对松脂生产的具体领导，在安排竹木生产与营林工作的同时，要把松脂生产列为必须完成的任务。对任务已经下达的地区要进行检查，使计划落实。对没有安排任务的地区，特别是今年要进行采伐和老采脂区，在各级党委的支持下要迅速安排好劳动力，帮助人民公社组织专业采脂队，坐山采脂，并加强对专业队的技术指导，根据“按劳分配”的原则，合理解决分配问题。在生产中要贯彻采脂与采伐相结合的方针，大搞技术革新，推广先进经验，开展“高产、高质、高工效”的三高竞赛，确保松脂任务的完成和超额完成。
    本报讯　黑龙江省林业厅、商业厅于6月底在伊春五营地区联合召开了松香生产现场会议。中共黑龙江省委书记、副省长杨易辰参加了会议，并在会上讲了话，他号召职工克服困难，多快好省地完成松香生产计划。
    会议交流了五营地区林业、商业部门共同协作，推动松香生产的经验，号召林业部门要调动一切积极因素，大力进行松香生产；商业部门要充分供应松香生产所需的工具，进一步加强协作，保证完成今年松香生产计划。
    会议指出：7、8月份是黑龙江省松香生产的关键季节，因此要求各地要广泛地组织专业的和业余的采脂队，争时间、争主动、争上游，保证供应松香生产充足的原料。
    又讯　为扩大松香生产，满足国家生产和人民生活需要，黑龙江省伊春市林业部门和商业部门共同协作，组织了四百多人的松香专业生产队，进山生产。
    林业部门和商业部门在市委的领导下，分工协作，多产多收。商业部门通过跟踪收购负责工具供应，林业部门负责发动工人进行业余生产。目前，工人的生产积极性很高，上甘岭林业局工人李成年在不影响木材生产的前提下，采取“顺手牵羊”的办法，五天中就采了十五斤松脂。从第二季度到6月25日仅丰林林业局就挂上一万二千多个接脂器，采集三千七百多斤松脂。上甘岭、美溪、丰林、双子河、友好、伊东等林业局，采取土法上马、土洋结合的方法，已提炼出三吨多优质松香。全市到6月下旬已采集松脂十六吨多。
