Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 14th dispatch: Miami, Florida, has become a haven for Batista criminals harbored by the United States and a base for U.S. subversive activities against the Cuban government.

On the 11th, Cuban Acting Minister of State, Armando Arte, announced that the Cuban government will immediately request the U.S. government to extradite war criminals who have fled to the United States, including former Senator Masferrer of the Batista dictatorship, former Deputy Chief of the National Police Conrado, and former Naval Intelligence Minister Laurent. These heinous Cuban war criminals are mostly concentrated in Miami.

The escape of Batista criminals to Miami was carried out under the planning of the United States. At the beginning of this year, when the Batista dictatorship had just collapsed, the U.S. State Department announced that about five hundred Cuban "refugees," including Batista's family members and his senior officials, had arrived in the United States.

Recently, the Cuban government pointed out that many of the uncovered counter-revolutionary cases are closely related to Batista elements in Miami. On July 2, the Cuban police authorities announced that one of the leaders of domestic counter-revolutionary conspiracies was the unrepentant war criminal Masferrer, who had fled to Miami.

The day after the Cuban police authorities issued the above statement, the U.S. "Daily Mail" immediately published an article, on the one hand admitting that the ringleader of the subversive activities was in Miami, and on the other hand threatening Cuba that "Castro is facing the danger of being overthrown." On the same day, the "Washington Post" even simply called for U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Dillon to go to Havana to make a "final on-site effort." If this intervention fails, then Miami will be their outpost for armed intervention in Cuba.

An article published by the British "Intelligence Digest" not long ago stated that Miami is now "the headquarters for political activities throughout the Caribbean... There, you can see many people who are carrying out conspiracies in the Caribbean or who feel they have lost power."

Batista elements are carrying out counter-revolutionary activities in Miami in various ways. An Associated Press dispatch on May 22 admitted that Batista elements cooperated with Miami police to use aircraft under the name of "Cleveland Air Power Company" to transport weapons from Miami International Airport to the Dominican Republic, in order to supply the Batista bandits there in preparation for launching an armed attack on Cuba. They also organized the so-called "Anti-Communist Volunteer Army" with Trujillo's dictator's agents in Miami to prepare to attack Cuba. United Press International also admitted that Batista criminals used Florida as a base and used American aircraft several times to invade Havana airspace to distribute reactionary leaflets. According to a revelation by the Cuban ambassador to the United Kingdom on July 2, Batista henchmen established an organization in the United States called "White Rose," specializing in creating political and economic chaos in Cuba.

### 美国加紧策划武装干涉  迈阿密成为侵略古巴前哨  巴蒂斯塔匪徒麕集　美国当局大力栽培

    美国加紧策划武装干涉
    迈阿密成为侵略古巴前哨
    巴蒂斯塔匪徒麕集　美国当局大力栽培
    新华社14日讯　哈瓦那消息：美国佛罗里达州的迈阿密城已经成为美国收容的巴蒂斯塔罪犯的巢穴和美国对古巴政府进行颠复活动的基地。
    古巴代理国务部长阿曼多·阿特11日宣布，古巴政府将立即要求美国政府引渡潜逃在美国的战争罪犯，其中包括巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的前参议员马斯费雷尔、前国民警察副警长孔拉多和前海军情报部长劳伦特。这些罪大恶极的古巴战犯目前大都集中在迈阿密城。
    巴蒂斯塔罪犯逃到迈阿密城，是在美国的策划下进行的。今年年初巴蒂斯塔独裁政权刚刚垮台的时候，美国务院就曾宣布，有大约五百个古巴“难民”，其中包括巴蒂斯塔的家属和他的高级官员已经到达美国。
    最近古巴政府指出，许多被破获的反革命案件都是跟在迈阿密城的巴蒂斯塔党徒有密切的关联。古巴警察当局7月2日宣布，国内反革命阴谋活动的领导者之一就是潜逃在迈阿密城的怙恶不悛的战犯马斯费雷尔。
    古巴警察当局发表上述声明的第二天，美国“每日邮报”马上发表一篇文章，一方面承认颠复活动的魁首就在迈阿密城，另一方面威胁古巴说，“卡斯特罗正在面临着被赶下台的危险。”在同一天，“华盛顿邮报”甚至干脆叫美国副国务卿狄龙赶到哈瓦那去作一番“最后的现场努力”。如果这种干涉失败了，那么迈阿密城便是他们武装干涉古巴的前哨。
    英国“情报文摘”不久以前发表的一篇文章说，现在的迈阿密城“成了整个加勒比地区进行政治活动……的总部。在那里，可以看到许多正在加勒比地区进行阴谋活动的人们或自己感到已经失去权力的人们。”
    巴蒂斯塔分子正在迈阿密城进行各方面的反革命活动。美联社5月22日发出的一条消息承认，巴蒂斯塔党徒跟迈阿密警察合作，用
  “克利夫兰航空动力公司”名义的飞机载满了武器从迈阿密国际机场运往多米尼加共和国，以便供给在那里的巴蒂斯塔匪徒准备发动对古巴的武装进攻。他们还跟特鲁希略独裁者在迈阿密的代理人组织准备进攻古巴的所谓“反共义勇军”。合众国际社也承认巴蒂斯塔罪犯以佛罗里达为基地，曾经使用美国飞机数次侵入哈瓦那上空散发反动传单。据古巴驻英国大使7月2日揭露，巴蒂斯塔党羽在美国成立了一个名叫“白玫瑰”的组织，专门用来在古巴制造政治和经济上的混乱。
