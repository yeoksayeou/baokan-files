Xinhua News Agency, Madrid: The Franco government of Spain, which is in a severe economic and financial crisis, officially announced on the 20th the devaluation of its currency, reducing the Spanish peseta from 42 to 60 per U.S. dollar, a devaluation of 42.8%.

The Spanish government's announcement of the currency devaluation is part of the economic "reform" measures taken to beg for foreign aid and is also a measure by which the Franco dictatorship, in collusion with foreign monopoly capital, further attacks the Spanish people and the petty bourgeoisie.

It is reported that, in addition to currency devaluation, the Spanish government will soon announce restrictions on loans to Spanish private enterprises, relax restrictions on foreign investment in Spain, and allow certain foreign goods to compete freely in the Spanish market.

Under these conditions, the European Economic Cooperation Bureau, the International Monetary Fund, and American banks have agreed to provide Spain with loans of $375 million.

Franco's more than 20 years of dictatorial rule have brought Spain to the brink of economic ruin and impoverishment. Spain's budget deficit now exceeds $300 million. Due to the excessive issuance of banknotes, prices are constantly rising. According to official statistics, the cost of living has risen by more than 40% in the last three years, while wages have remained unchanged. As a result, the purchasing power of residents has fallen sharply. Domestic industry and commerce are constantly going bankrupt. This situation is also reflected in foreign trade. In the past two years, Spain's trade deficit has reached $250 million. Unfavorable foreign trade directly affects foreign exchange reserves. Even Franco's confidants are beginning to worry that this development of the Spanish economy will lead to the final collapse of the Franco regime. Therefore, many important people are transferring their assets abroad. In the "foreign exchange scandal" revealed at the beginning of this year alone, 1,000 people were found to have done so. They have illegally remitted nearly $1 billion abroad.

People from all walks of life have pointed out that the so-called "reform" measures taken by the Franco government to solve the economic crisis are tantamount to drinking poison to quench thirst.

### 佛朗哥政府饮鸩止渴  宣布西班牙货币贬值

    佛朗哥政府饮鸩止渴
    宣布西班牙货币贬值
    据新华社讯　马德里消息：处于严重经济和财政危机中的佛朗哥西班牙，在20日正式宣布货币贬值，把西班牙的比塞塔从四十二兑换一美元降低到六十兑换一美元，贬值42.8％。
    西班牙政府宣布货币贬值是为了乞求外援而采取的经济“改革”措施的部分，也是佛朗哥独裁政权和外国垅断资本互相勾结进一步进攻西班牙人民和中小资产阶级的一种措施。
    据报道，除了货币贬值外，西班牙政府还将在最近宣布，紧缩对西班牙私人企业的贷款，放宽外国人在西班牙投资的限制，并且允许某些外国货物在西班牙市场上进行自由竞争。
    在采取这些措施的条件下，欧洲经济合作局、国际货币基金组织和美国银行答应向西班牙提供三亿七千五百万美元的贷款。
    佛朗哥二十多年的独裁统治已经把西班牙搞得民穷财尽。现在西班牙的预算赤字超过三亿美元。由于滥发纸币，物价不断上涨。据官方统计，最近三年来，生活费用上涨了40％多，而工资则原封未动。因此，居民的购买力大大下降。国内工商业不断破产。这种情况在对外贸易方面也有所反映。最近两年来，西班牙的贸易赤字达二亿五千万美元。对外贸易的不利直接影响外汇的储备。甚至佛朗哥的亲信也开始担心西班牙经济的这种发展将导致佛朗哥政权的最后崩溃。因此，许多要人都把他们的资财转移到国外。仅在今年年初揭露出的“外汇丑闻”中，就发现一千个这样作的人。他们已经把近十亿美元非法汇出国外。
    各方面的人士都指出：佛朗哥政府现在为解救经济危机而采取的这种所谓“改革”措施，无异饮鸩止渴。
