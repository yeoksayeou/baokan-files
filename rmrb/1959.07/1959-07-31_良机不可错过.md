A Golden Opportunity Must Not Be Missed

Milk production also has peak and off-peak seasons. For dairy cows in the north, the period with the highest milk yield is generally in the summer when aquatic plants grow luxuriantly; in winter, dairy cows produce less milk. Therefore, tightly grasping the favorable season and producing more dairy products is an important task for the dairy industry.

The dairy product processing departments in Inner Mongolia have organized a large number of cadres to go deep into pastoral areas to help ranches prepare for expanding production and to welcome the peak season production, while also organizing purchases. This approach is very timely.

A golden opportunity is not to be missed, and time never returns. For all seasonal production, seizing the opportunity is victory. Otherwise, once the opportunity is missed, one can only wait for next year.

    良机不可错过
    牛奶生产，也有旺季和淡季之分。北方的乳牛，产奶量最多的时期，一般都是在水草生长旺盛的夏季；冬天乳牛产奶量就比较少。所以紧紧抓住有利季节，多产乳品，是乳品工业的重要任务。
    内蒙古乳制品加工部门，组织大批干部，深入牧区，帮助牧场做好扩大生产准备，迎接旺季生产，同时组织收购，这种做法是很适时的。
    机不可失，时不再来。凡是季节性的生产，抓住时机就是胜利。否则，时机一过，就只有等待来年了。
