    Review Achievements, Exchange Experiences, and Make Progress Together:
    Closing of the Second National Arts Festival of the People's Liberation Army

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The largest PLA Second Arts Festival since the founding of the army has successfully concluded after more than fifty days of intense performances.

    The closing ceremony was held at the Music Hall on the evening of the 24th. Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, General Zhang Zongxun, General Yang Chengwu, General Peng Shaohui, General Xiao Hua, General Li Juikui, Admiral of the Navy Su Zhenhua, General Chen Shiju, General Wang Xinting and others attended the closing ceremony tonight.

    Also attending the closing ceremony were Ji Pengfei, Zeng Yongquan, Chu Tunan, Hu Keshi, Lao She, Liu Baiyu, Lü Ji, Zhou Weizhi, Yuan Shuipai, Cai Chusheng, as well as representatives of the various art troupes participating in the festival and representatives of various agencies, military units, and art groups in the capital, totaling more than 3,000 people.

    Military attachés from various countries stationed in China, as well as artists and experts from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries in Beijing, were also invited to attend the closing ceremony.

    The closing ceremony began with the solemn national anthem played by the orchestra. Deputy Director of the General Political Department, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, delivered the closing speech. (Excerpts of the speech will be published separately.)

    After Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian's speech, a wonderful artistic performance began. The programs performed were excellent selections from the professional and amateur performing troupes in this Arts Festival. With a strong spirit of the times, distinct military characteristics, and rich national style, they were warmly welcomed by the audience.

    This newspaper reports: The Second Arts Festival of the People's Liberation Army began on June 1st and ended on July 21st. Under the kind concern of the central leading comrades and the direct leadership of the leaders of the General Political Department, the conference has successfully completed the tasks of reviewing achievements, exchanging experiences, and making progress together through performances and observations.

    During the conference, Party and state leaders Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Peng Zhen, Peng Dehuai, Luo Ronghuan, Chen Yi, Bo Yibo, Wang Jiaxiang, Kang Sheng, and others successively received the representatives attending the conference, and Marshal Peng Dehuai gave a speech on literary and artistic work to the cadres present, which greatly encouraged all the representatives.

    This Arts Festival fully demonstrates that under the guidance of the Party's correct policy of "literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and with the attention and promotion of Party committees and leaders at all levels, the PLA's literary and artistic work has achieved great success.

    Extensive themes, strong spirit of the times
    The extensive themes, novel content, and strong spirit of the times are one of the most prominent features of this Arts Festival. The performances over fifty days were like a magnificent and colorful scroll, depicting the glorious history of struggle of our army in various periods. The performances of programs such as "Red Eagle," "March 3rd," and "Remembering the Past" showed the heroic and arduous struggle life of the Red Army in those years, reminding people of the red flag proudly erected on Jinggang Mountain and the glorious footprints left on the Long March; the performances of programs such as "Overture to the Eastward Advance," "Remembering General Yang Jingyu," and "Wild Goose Team" depicted our army's heroic resistance against Japan, its indomitable heroic spirit, and its immortal feats; the performances of programs such as "South China Sea Battle Song," "Million-Strong Army Crosses the Yangtze River," and "Roads of May" recorded our army's sweeping away of evil spirits with the force of a thunderbolt in the Liberation War, liberating the mainland of the country with heroic achievements that are both admirable and touching; the performances of programs such as "On the 38th Parallel," "Immortal Warrior," and "Under the Old Pear Tree" depicted the volunteer army's arduous struggle in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, fiercely attacking the aggressors, and also demonstrated the incomparably deep internationalist friendship between the volunteer army and the Korean People's Army. What is particularly exciting is that programs reflecting the major themes of our army's defense of socialist construction over the past ten years are very abundant. Various tasks of our army in modern construction and the rich and colorful real-life struggles of the troops, such as the struggle on the Fujian front, the suppression of rebellions, training, construction, border defense struggles, supporting industrial and agricultural production, military-civilian relations, and officer-soldier relations, have all been vividly artistically represented in some aspects, shaping many heroic images that are both vivid and deeply moving. Many serious and complex political and military struggle themes, such as the united front, the crossing-the-sea campaign, and land reform to oppose local bullies, are not easy to express perfectly with artistic means; however, many programs in this Arts Festival boldly selected these themes and expressed them relatively successfully. Performances of programs such as "Overture to the Eastward Advance," "Red Eagle," "South China Sea Battle Song," and "Locust Tree Village" have all achieved gratifying achievements in this regard. The Arts Festival fully proves that the themes of revolutionary war and the people's army are very broad, and writing about soldiers and performing soldiers has great potential.

      A hundred flowers bloom, diverse forms
    All the programs in this Arts Festival commonly embody the spirit of literature and art serving politics and serving national defense construction; however, in terms of artistic expression, they are blooming with a hundred flowers and are rich and diverse. According to statistics, there are thirty-one forms of performance by professional art troupes, and as many as thirty-four forms of performance by amateur art troupes. On the one hand, the literary and artistic workers of the troops pay attention to learning the excellent artistic traditions of the nation and the folk, and at the same time, they also pay attention to absorbing foreign artistic experiences and trying out some new artistic forms and expressions with national style and military characteristics. Drama - a relatively weak link in the current theater scene - has achieved a gratifying harvest in this PLA Arts Festival. Opera, which the troops performed relatively little in the past, has seen the emergence of many programs with a certain level in this Arts Festival. Ballet is still a young genre in our country, but there are as many as eighteen ballets of various sizes performed in this PLA Arts Festival. The large-scale ballet "Butterfly Lovers," adapted from Chairman Mao's original poem, and the large-scale ballet "Five Red Clouds," which reflects the struggle of the Li people of Hainan Island against the Kuomintang reactionaries, have been unanimously praised by the audience. Forms such as poetry performance and song performance have also developed in the performances. The organic combination of collective recitation, individual recitation, performance, music, and dance has greatly enhanced the artistic effect and produced a strong artistic appeal. In addition, creative achievements have also been made in instrumental music, singing and dancing, opera, ballet accompaniment, and in the exchange and integration of Chinese and Western music. The performance of "Battlefield Music" is very touching because of the combination of the creative soldiers' handmade instruments and the touching political spirit. Dance also has achievements in absorbing the essence of national and classical dance, and in absorbing certain techniques of ballet. In addition, there have also been improvements in folk art and acrobatics. The new comic dialogue "Yesterday" is one that has received enthusiastic praise from the audience.

      A harvest of creations, talent emerging
    Except for a few instrumental pieces, all of the more than 400 programs performed in this Arts Festival are new works since the Great Leap Forward. After the great rectification movement, the influence of bourgeois literary and artistic thought on the troops was overcome, enabling the literary and artistic workers of the troops to make great progress and improvement in political thought. Professional literary and artistic workers actively responded to the Party's call, went deep into life, went down to exercise, and ate, lived, worked, and fought with the soldiers. Some comrades also went deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time to live and study, opening up a source for creation. Today's PLA cultural troupes are not only performing units, but also creative units. Relatively excellent programs such as "General as a Soldier" and "Red Eagle" were created on the basis of literary and artistic workers going down to exercise and going deep into life, and under the kind care and guidance of the leaders of the troops. What is particularly worth mentioning is that many excellent works were written by young authors. A new creative force has already grown in the troops. In addition, a group of excellent actors, directors, conductors, and stage art workers have emerged in this Arts Festival. The emergence of these new forces shows that the literary and artistic work of our army has a broad mass base and strong reserve potential. The amateur literary and artistic workers of the troops live in the heat of the struggle. They have rich life experiences in the intense fighting, training, construction, and defense of borders, seas, and air, so they can also create programs such as "Night at the Reservoir," "Morning of the East China Sea," and "East China Sea Fisherman's Song" that combine revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism well. "The people's life is the only source of literature and art." The Arts Festival once again proved this truth with vivid facts.

        Professional and amateur shine together
    In this Arts Festival, both the professional cultural troupes and the amateur art performance teams have achieved great success. The literary and artistic activities of the troops have a broad mass base. The participants in this Arts Festival include generals, soldiers, and troops' employees, as well as officers' families. Everyone gathered together to sing the praises of the motherland's Great Leap Forward and the brilliant achievements of the troops' modernization. The performance of the Generals' Amateur Chorus played a leading role in the development of amateur literary and artistic activities in the troops, fully embodying the excellent tradition of unity between officers and soldiers and the joy of officers and soldiers in our army. Their songs and their enthusiasm greatly educated and moved all comrades. In addition, many comrades such as Gao Jiashan, Zhang Manqing, and Du Fangmo, some of them are combat heroes and some of them are "Five Goods" pacesetters, but they are all outstanding literary and artistic backbones.

    In this Arts Festival, each delegation has consistently implemented the spirit of performing, observing, commenting, and learning at the same time from beginning to end. Through airing opinions, discussions, and visits, they exchanged experiences in creation and performance, and also put forward pertinent criticisms and opinions on the shortcomings and shortcomings of the programs. Therefore, the participants in the Arts Festival generally reflected that they have gained a lot.

    After the Arts Festival, the General Political Department will also convene an army-wide literary and artistic work conference to summarize experience and study future work. It is believed that after this Arts Festival and the literary and artistic work conference, the literary and artistic work of the troops will surely have a great improvement. (Attached picture)

    检阅成绩　交流经验　共同进步
    解放军二届文艺会演大会闭幕
    据新华社讯　建军以来规模最大的全军第二届文艺会演大会，经过五十多天的紧张演出，现已胜利闭幕。
    闭幕大会于24日晚在音乐堂举行。郭沫若副委员长、张宗逊上将、杨成武上将、彭绍辉上将、萧华上将、李聚奎上将、苏振华海军上将、陈士榘上将、王新亭上将等出席了今晚的闭幕式。
    出席闭幕式的还有姬鹏飞、曾涌泉、楚图南、胡克实、老舍、刘白羽、吕骥、周巍峙、袁水拍、蔡楚生以及参加会演的各文艺代表队和首都各机关、部队、文艺团体的代表等共三千多人。
    各国驻华武官和苏联等兄弟国家在北京的艺术工作者和专家，也应邀出席了闭幕式。
    闭幕式在乐队高奏庄严的国歌声中开始。总政治部副主任刘志坚中将致闭幕词。（讲话摘要另发）
    刘志坚中将讲话后，精彩的文艺表演开始。演出的节目，都是这届文艺会演中专业文工团和业余演出队的优秀节目。它以强烈的时代精神、鲜明的部队特色和浓郁的民族风格，受到观众的热烈欢迎。
    本报讯　解放军二届文艺会演从6月1日开始到7月21日结束。大会在中央领导同志的亲切关怀和总政治部首长的直接领导下，通过演出、观摩，已经胜利完成了检阅成绩、交流经验、共同进步的任务。
    在大会进行期间，党和国家的领导人毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、彭真、彭德怀、罗荣桓、陈毅、薄一波、王稼祥、康生等同志，先后接见了参加大会的代表，彭德怀元帅给到会干部作了关于文艺工作的讲话，使全体代表受到很大的鼓舞。
    这次会演，充分显示了解放军文艺工作在党的“文艺为工农兵服务”和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的正确方针的指导下，在各级党委和首长的重视与推动之下，已经获得了巨大的成绩。题材广泛，具有强烈的时代精神
    题材广泛，内容新颖，具有强烈的时代精神，是这次会演最突出的特点之一。五十多天的演出，像一幅色彩绚烂的画卷，描绘了我军各个时期壮丽的斗争史实。“红鹰”、“三月三”、“忆当年”等节目的演出，表现了当年红军英勇艰苦的斗争生活，使人忆起傲然树立在井岗山上的红旗和遗留在长征路上光荣的脚印；“东进序曲”、“怀念杨靖宇将军”、“雁翎队”等节目的演出，描写了我军英勇抗日、不屈不挠的英雄气概和不朽功勋；“南海战歌”、“百万雄师下江南”、“五月的道路”等节目的演出，记述了我军在解放战争中以雷霆万钧之势，扫荡妖氛，解放全国大陆可歌可泣的英雄业绩；“三八线上”、“不朽的战士”、“老梨树下”等节目的演出，描写了志愿军在抗美援朝战争中艰苦奋战痛击侵略者的壮举，也表现了志愿军和朝鲜人民军之间无比深厚的国际主义友谊。特别令人兴奋的是表现十年来我军保卫社会主义建设时期的重大题材的节目十分丰茂。我军在现代建设中的各项工作以及部队丰富多采的现实斗争生活，如福建前线斗争、平定叛乱、训练、施工、边防斗争，支援工农业生产、军民关系、官兵关系等重大主题，无不从某些方面得到了生动的艺术表现，塑造了许多有血有肉、感人至深的英雄形象。许多严肃而又复杂的政治、军事斗争的题材，如统一战线、渡海战役、土改反霸等，要想用艺术手段圆满地表现出来，并不是一件很容易的事；可是这次会演中的不少节目，大胆地选择了这些题材，而且比较成功地表现了出来。像“东进序曲”、“红鹰”、“南海战歌”、“槐树庄”等节目的演出，在这方面都获得了可喜的成就。会演充分证明，表现革命战争和人民军队的题材是十分广泛的，写兵、演兵是大有可为的。
      百花齐放，形式多样
    这次会演的全部节目，共同体现了文艺为政治服务、为国防建设服务的精神；但是，在艺术表现形式上却是百花齐放、丰富多采。据统计，专业文工团的演出形式有三十一种，业余文艺演出队的演出形式多达三十四种。部队的文艺工作者们，一方面注意学习民族的民间的优秀艺术传统，同时也注意吸收外国的艺术经验，尝试了一些具有民族风格和部队特色的新的艺术形式和表现方法。话剧——这个目前剧坛上比较薄弱的环节，这次在全军文艺会演当中得到了可喜的丰收。歌剧，在过去一个时期，部队演的比较少，但在这次会演中却出现了不少具有一定水平的节目。舞剧，在我国来说还是个年青的剧种，而这次全军会演中演出大大小小的舞剧也有十八个之多。根据毛主席原词改编的大型舞剧“蝶恋花”和以反映海南岛黎族人民和国民党反动派作斗争为题材的大型舞剧“五朵红云”等许多舞剧的演出，受到观众的一致好评。诗表演、歌表演等等形式在演出中也有了发展，把集体朗诵、个人朗诵、表演、音乐、舞蹈有机地结合起来，就大大加强了艺术效果，产生了强烈的艺术感染力。此外，在器乐、演唱和舞蹈、歌剧、舞剧配曲等方面，在中西乐的交流溶合上，也具有创造性的成绩。“战地音乐”的演出，由于使用创造性的战士手制的乐器与感人的政治精神结合，十分感人。舞蹈在吸收民族和古典舞的精华，和吸收芭蕾舞某些技术上，也有成就。此外在曲艺、杂技方面，也都有提高。新相声“昨天”就是受到观众热烈赞许的一个。
      创作丰收，人才辈出
    这次会演中演出的四百多个节目，除少数的器乐演奏曲外，其余全部是大跃进以来的新作。在伟大的整风运动之后，克服了资产阶级文艺思想对部队的影响，使部队文艺工作者在政治思想上获得了巨大的进步和提高。专业文艺工作者积极响应了党的号召，深入生活，下放锻炼，和士兵们同吃、同住、同劳动、同战斗，有的同志还较长期地深入到工农兵群众中去生活、学习，为创作开拓了源泉。今日解放军的文工团，不但是演出单位，而且也是创作单位。像“将军当兵”、“红鹰”等比较优秀的节目，都是在文艺工作者下放锻炼深入生活的基础上，在部队首长的亲切关怀和指导下创作出来的。特别值得提出的是许多优秀作品，都是年青的作者们执笔写成的。部队里业已生长了一批新生的创作力量。此外，这次会演中也涌现出一批优秀的演员、导演、指挥和舞台美术工作者。这些新生力量的出现，说明我军文艺工作有着广泛的群众基础和强大的后备潜力。部队的业余文艺工作者，生活在火热的斗争中，他们在紧张的战斗、训练、施工和保卫边防、海防、空防的斗争中，有着丰富的生活感受，所以也能够创作出像“水库的夜晚”、“东海的早晨”、“东海渔歌”等革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义结合得很好的节目。“人民生活是文学艺术唯一的源泉”，会演以生动的事实再次证明了这个真理。
        专业和业余并茂
    这次会演，无论专业文工团或业余文艺演出队的演出，都取得了巨大的成就。部队的文艺活动具有广泛的群众基础。参加这次会演的有将军、有士兵、有部队职工，还有军官家属。大家齐聚一堂，共同来歌颂祖国的大跃进和部队现代化建设的辉煌成就。将军业余合唱团的演出，对部队业余文艺活动的开展起了带头作用，充分体现了我军上下团结、官兵同乐的优良传统。他们的歌声、他们的热情，使全体同志受到极大的教育和感动。此外，如高家善、张满庆、杜方模等许多同志，他们有的是战斗英雄、有的是“五好”标兵，但他们又都是出色的文艺骨干。
    这次会演，各代表队自始至终贯彻了边演出、边观摩、边评论、边学习的精神，通过鸣放、座谈和访问，交流了创作和演出经验，对节目不足之处和缺点，也提出了中肯的批评和意见，因此参加会演的人员普遍反映收获很大。
    文艺会演以后，总政治部还要召开全军文艺工作会议，总结经验，研究今后工作。相信在这次会演和文艺工作会议之后，部队的文艺工作一定会有一个大提高。（附图片）
