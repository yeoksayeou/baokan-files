Nanjing, July 3rd (reported by our newspaper) The Party branch of the Laibu Brigade of the Linze People's Commune in Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, after studying the local farmers' habit of emphasizing irrigation and weeding but neglecting manure accumulation and topdressing in rice management, used a large number of facts to persuade the masses and launched a field management campaign of "Passing the Irrigation, Manure Accumulation, and Topdressing Stages Simultaneously."

The Laibu Brigade is an advanced team in the Linze Commune. By June 25th, the entire brigade's more than 500 mu of single-season early rice had been weeded for the second time, and some of the early-planted mid-season rice had also begun weeding and harrowing for soil loosening. In terms of irrigation, the more than 1,000 mu of self-flowing irrigated fields were managed by water release personnel; a portion of the fields that could not be self-flowing irrigated had windmills installed for water lifting. However, manure accumulation work was relaxed, and no one was seen busy accumulating manure throughout the entire brigade. According to statistics from June 18th to 24th for seven days, of the 375 laborers in the entire brigade, 16% were used for irrigation, 66% for weeding, and 18% for sideline occupations and livestock management.

After in-depth understanding, the Party branch found that there were three reasons why the small team cadres and commune members neglected manure accumulation and topdressing: (1) The historical habit was: first busy with water, second busy with weeds, and third busy with fertilizer. Old farmer Wu Guangren said: "In drought years, we are busy with water; if it is not a drought, we weed; if there are not many weeds, we are busy with fertilizer." According to his opinion, water, weeds, and fertilizer cannot be taken care of simultaneously, but can only be done in sequence. (2) Most small team cadres and commune members saw that the rice seedlings were growing well and became complacent. Old farmer Wang Yushan said: "This year we have self-flowing irrigation, so water is not a problem. Many weeds will harm the seedlings, and now everyone is busy weeding. The whole brigade is focused on water and weeds, and I think with these two things, we can have a good harvest in the autumn." This reflected the views of many people. (3) Many people believed that if enough base fertilizer was applied, topdressing would not be needed; and if topdressing was needed, it was only for a small number of third-class seedlings with insufficient base fertilizer.

Based on these circumstances, the Party branch organized small team cadres to discuss the issue twice, and mobilized commune members to study "Simultaneously passing the water, weed, and fertilizer stages." What are the benefits of this to strive for a greater autumn harvest? After in-depth and meticulous discussion and research, many small team cadres and commune members realized that the practice of first focusing on water, then weeds, and then fertilizer in rice paddy field management was an inevitable practice before communization due to poor conditions and weak strength, only seeking harvest and not ensuring a bumper harvest. The situation of rice paddy field management in this brigade last year powerfully illustrated that this practice should be changed. Last year, after summer planting, the Ziying Production Team used labor for drought resistance, field management focused on irrigation, and weeding and topdressing were relaxed. The average yield of more than 300 mu of rice was 380 jin per mu, the lowest yield. The Central Production Team focused on both drought resistance and weeding. The average yield of more than 300 mu of rice was 410 jin per mu. The Xu Zhong Production Team had 70 mu of mid-season rice fields, and the irrigation and weeding were done well. They also applied topdressing once before heading, and the result was an average yield of 510 jin per mu. Through the discussion of "comparing yields to find the reasons," the cadres and masses unanimously believed that "simultaneously passing the water, weed, and fertilizer stages" is a good way to increase production. Only focusing on weeding and irrigation and relaxing manure accumulation and topdressing can only result in a small harvest, not a big harvest.

During the discussion, each team further analyzed the favorable conditions this year and came up with many ways to accumulate manure and vigorously engage in manure accumulation. The commune members of the Xu Zhong, Ziying, and Shuanggou Production Teams originally thought that the weeding task was heavy and they could not spare people to accumulate manure. After discussion, everyone believed that the conditions this year were better than last year. Last year, they had to tread waterwheels all night for drought resistance. This year, with self-flowing irrigation, they should save labor to accumulate manure. Therefore, these teams successively extracted 15%-20% of their labor force to engage in manure accumulation and topdressing work. The Laidong and Laixi Production Teams, which originally had a large task of water wheel irrigation, also readjusted the layout of the windmills according to the new requirements of combining water, weeds, and fertilizer in field management, found ways to expand the irrigated area, saved more than 20 laborers, and established professional teams for manure accumulation and topdressing.

By June 29th, the Laibu Brigade had formed a professional team of 75 people for manure accumulation and topdressing. Six small boats were sent to the ponds to cut green grass, which could accumulate more than 15,000 jin of green manure every day. The topdressing work of more than 500 mu of early rice fields has been 70% completed. Last year, only 20% of the team's more than 1,900 mu of fields were topdressed. This year, according to the existing household fertilizer, chemical fertilizer, and the fertilizer accumulated through the manure accumulation campaign, it is estimated that all of the team's more than 1,900 mu of rice fields can be topdressed once. This effectively guarantees a bumper harvest of autumn crops this year.

### 来部生产队用事实教育群众全面加强稻田管理  浇水锄草追肥环环抓紧

    来部生产队用事实教育群众全面加强稻田管理
    浇水锄草追肥环环抓紧
    本报南京3日电　江苏省高邮县临泽人民公社来部大队的党支部，研究了当地农民在水稻管理上重视灌溉、除草，不重视积肥追肥的习惯后，用大量事实说服群众，开展了“灌溉、积肥、追肥三关一齐过”的田间管理运动。
    来部大队是临泽公社的一个先进队。到6月25日为止，全大队五百多亩单季早稻锄完了第二遍草，一部分早栽的中稻也开始锄草和耥耙松土工作。在灌溉方面，一千多亩自流灌溉的田，都有放水员管理；不能自流灌溉的一部分田，有重点地安装了风车提水。但是，积肥工作却放松了，走遍了全大队，看不到有人忙积肥。根据6月18到24日七天统计，全大队三百七十五个劳力，每天用于灌溉方面的占16％，用于锄草方面的占66％，用于副业和牲畜管理方面的占18％。
    党支部经过深入了解，发现小队干部和社员忽视积肥追肥有三个原因：（一）历年习惯是：第一忙水，第二忙草，第三才忙肥。老农吴广仁说：“抗旱年成是忙水，不抗旱就除草，草也不多就忙肥。”按照他的意见，水、草、肥不能同时兼顾，只能顺次序地做。（二）多数小队干部和社员看到秧苗长势很好，产生了自满的情绪。老农王裕山说：“今年有了自流灌溉，水不成问题了。草多会欺苗，现在人人忙除草，全大队抓水又抓草，我看有了这两样，秋熟就可以丰收。”这反映了很多人的看法。（三）许多人认为基肥下得足，就不需要追肥；要追肥的，也只是少数底肥不足的三类苗。
    党支部根据这些情况，组织小队干部讨论了两次，并以小队为单位，发动社员研究“水、草、肥三关一齐过”，对于争取秋熟更大丰收有什么好处？经过深入细致的讨论与研究，许多小队干部和社员都认识到水稻田间管理先抓水、后抓草、有余力再抓肥的做法，是公社化以前条件差、力量弱，只求有收，不保丰收的不得已的做法。这个大队去年水稻田间管理的情况，有力地说明了这种做法是应当改变的。去年夏插以后，子英生产小队劳力用于抗旱，田间管理抓了灌溉，放松了锄草和追肥，三百多亩水稻平均亩产三百八十斤，产量最低。中心生产小队既抓抗旱，又抓锄草，三百多亩水稻，平均单产是四百一十斤。徐中生产小队有七十亩中稻田，灌溉和除草农活做得好，在抽穗前又追了一次肥，结果平均亩产五百一十斤。通过“比产量，找原因”的讨论，干部和群众一致认为：“水、草、肥三关一齐过”，是增产的好办法。单抓锄草和灌溉，放松了积肥追肥，只能小丰收，不能大丰收。
    各队在讨论中，进一步分析了今年的有利条件，想出许多积肥办法，大搞积肥。徐中、子英、双沟三个生产小队的社员，原来认为锄草任务重，抽不出人来积肥。经过讨论以后，大家认为今年条件比去年好，去年抗旱连夜踏水车，今年有了自流灌溉，应该省出劳力来积肥。因此，这几个队先后抽出15％—20％的劳力去搞积肥和追肥工作。原来车水灌溉任务较大的来东、来西两个生产小队，也根据田间管理水、草、肥三结合的新要求，重新调整了风车布局，想办法扩大了灌溉面积，节省了二十多个劳动力，成立积肥和追肥的专业小组。
    到6月29日为止，来部大队已经组成了七十五人的积肥与追肥的专业队伍，有六只小船下荡割青草，每天能积绿肥一万五千多斤。五百多亩早稻田的追肥工作已经完成了70％。去年全队一千九百多亩田只有20％追过肥，今年全队根据现有的家肥、化肥、以及开展积肥运动攒积的肥料，预计一千九百多亩稻田，可以全部施一次追肥。这就有效地保证了今年秋熟作物大丰收。
