Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 1st: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting of financial and trade secretaries from prefectural, municipal, and county Party committees. The meeting focused on arranging current financial and trade work, requiring Party committees at all levels to strengthen their leadership over financial and trade work while focusing on production, especially strengthening leadership over commercial work.

The representatives attending the meeting, after discussion, unanimously agreed that the development trend of commodity supply in the autonomous region's market is getting better and better. This is because the autonomous region's industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production is continuing to leap forward this year. In terms of agricultural production, the summer harvest has already begun. According to the situation in many places, wheat is growing well this year, and a good harvest is expected; the growth of cotton and oil crops is also good. Animal husbandry production and industrial production have also seen great growth, and some products that could not be produced in the region in the past can now be produced. The continued leap forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production provides a material basis for doing a good job in market supply.

The meeting pointed out that all employees on the commercial work front must establish a production perspective, a political perspective, and a mass perspective, and promote production by doing a good job in commercial work. It is necessary to continue to implement the principle of solving the source of goods mainly through self-reliance, strengthen industrial and commercial cooperation and agricultural and commercial cooperation, and strive to produce a wide variety of products in large quantities and with good quality. Commercial departments should, where possible, concurrently operate some production projects that can be concurrently operated (including some processing industries suitable for commercial departments to run) to supplement some products and supply the market. It is necessary to assist in organizing the commodity production of the people's communes well; organize and help organs, enterprises, troops, and schools to do a good job in the production of non-staple foods.

In order to do a good job in commercial work, the meeting put forward the following requirements: First, seize the procurement work as early as possible. Now that the summer harvest has arrived, the procurement of agricultural products is imminent. We must implement the principle of collecting, threshing, purchasing, and transporting simultaneously, and truly achieve good harvesting, good requisition and purchase, good distribution, good use, and good summer planting. Second, pay attention to the development of production at all times, do a good job in the procurement of various products, increase the source of goods, and vigorously promote thrift. Third, under the leadership of state-owned commerce, extensively organize material exchanges. Fourth, further improve commodity reserve work. When there are many goods, we must consider when there are few goods; when sales are slow, we must consider when sales are brisk. At present, it is necessary to clear the inventory once, adjust what is available, and improve and strengthen warehouse management. Fifth, according to the characteristics of the vast area and long transportation lines of the autonomous region, actively strengthen industrial, agricultural, and commercial cooperation to increase the proportion of local sources of goods.

    自力更生解决货源　紧密协作促进生产
    新疆安排当前财贸工作
    新华社乌鲁木齐1日电　中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会最近召开了地市县委财贸书记会议，着重安排了当前的财贸工作，要求各级党委今后在抓生产的同时，加强对财贸工作的领导，特别是要加强对商业工作的领导。
    出席会议的代表经过讨论，一致认为自治区市场商品供应情况的发展趋势越来越好。这是因为今年自治区的工、农、牧业生产正在继续跃进。在农业生产方面，夏收已经开始。根据许多地方的情况看，今年小麦生长良好，丰收在望；棉花、油料的生长情况也好。畜牧业生产、工业生产也有很大的增长，过去有些本区不能生产的产品，现在也能生产了。工农牧业生产的继续跃进，为作好市场供应工作提供了物质基础。
    会议指出，商业工作战线上的全体职工，要树立起生产观点、政治观点和群众观点，要通过做好商业工作来促进生产。要继续贯彻执行以自力更生为主解决货源的原则，加强工商协作和农商协作，尽量做到生产的产品品种多、数量多、质量好。商业部门要在可能条件下，兼营一些能够兼营的生产项目（包括适宜由商业部门举办的一些加工工业），补充一些产品，供应市场。要协助组织好人民公社的商品性生产；组织和帮助机关、企业、部队、学校搞好副食品生产。
    为了作好商业工作，会议提出以下要求：一、要及早抓好收购工作。现在夏收已经到来，农产品的收购工作刻不容缓，必须贯彻边收、边打、边购、边运的原则，确实作到收获好、征购好、分配好、使用好和夏种好。二、要经常注意发展生产，做好各种产品的收购工作，增加货源，同时大力提倡节约。三、在国营商业的领导下，广泛组织物资交流。四、进一步做好商品储备工作。在货多的时候，要考虑到货少的时候；在淡销的时候，要考虑到旺销的时候。当前，要清理一次库存，调剂有无，改进和加强仓库管理。五、根据自治区地区辽阔、运输线长的特点，积极加强工农商协作，增加本地货源的比例。
