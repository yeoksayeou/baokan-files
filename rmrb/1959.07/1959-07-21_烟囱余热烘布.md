    Using Chimney Waste Heat to Dry Cloth
    Workers at the Shanghai No. 1 Knitting and Garment Factory have built a "native drying room" that utilizes the waste heat from the chimney. This "native drying room," which doesn't use a single radiator pipe or fuel, is built from old lead sheets, iron sheets, and other materials. The average temperature inside the drying room is around 45 degrees Celsius, and it takes about six hours to dry 30 bolts of cloth (11 kilograms per bolt), which is similar in efficiency to a regular radiator steam drying room. This can save more than one ton of coal per day.

    烟囱余热烘布
    上海针织服装一分厂工人，装成一只利用烟囱余热的“土烘间”。这个不用一根水汀管、也不用燃料的“土烘房”，是用旧铅皮、铁皮等建成的。烘房平均温度在摄氏四十五度左右，每烘三十匹布（每匹十一公斤）约六小时左右，和普通水汀蒸汽烘房效率相仿，每天可节约一吨多煤。
