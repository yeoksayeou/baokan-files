    Sneezing Record
    Chicago is the headquarters of record production in the United States. Howard Miller controls the record market.
    Film actor Tab Hunter can't sing at all, but Miller once asked film actor Hunter to perform sneezing on a record. As a result, Hunter's record "Sneezing" sold 2.5 million copies last year. Gambler and Ku Klux Klan member Johnny Ray recorded a record called "Cry," which sold more than 3 million copies.
    Where does the sneezing sound come from? A barrage of sneezes, who caught a cold? Hurry and call a doctor! It’s not a cold, no need to call a doctor, this is a musician, performing a new work!
    Where does the wailing sound come from? Such heartbreaking sorrow, which family suffered misfortune, lost their parents? It's not a misfortune, no parents died. Someone is playing a record, the record is called "Crying"!
    Musical geniuses are too numerous to count, everyone is waiting to see, there are new products: Flies buzzing, sows grunting... How well they sing, the characteristics are the most distinct!

    打喷嚏唱片
    芝加哥是美国灌唱片的总部。控制唱片市场的是荷威德·米勒。
    电影演员贴布·汉德，根本不会唱歌，米勒曾经要电影演员汉德在唱片中表演打喷嚏，结果，汉德的唱片“打喷嚏”，去年一年销出二百五十万张。赌棍、三K党人尊尼·雷，灌的一张叫“哭”的唱片，销出三百多万张。何来喷嚏声？连珠炮不停，是谁得感冒？赶快请医生！并非得感冒，不必请医生，这是音乐家，表演新作品！何来号啕声？哀哀痛断魂，谁家遭不幸，死了父母亲？并非遭不幸，死了父母亲。有人放唱片，片名叫“哭声”！天才音乐家，数也数不清，大家等着瞧，还有新产品：苍蝇嗡嗡嗡，母猪哼哼哼…唱得多么好，特点最鲜明！
