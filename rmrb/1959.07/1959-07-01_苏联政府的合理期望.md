The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference adjourned for three weeks on June 20th. Since then, Western countries have disseminated a large number of statements distorting the true situation of the first stage of the conference. They are trying to blame the Soviet Union for the fact that this stage of the conference did not achieve the results expected by the people of all countries, while pretending that they wanted to solve the problem. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko issued a statement on the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference on June 28, comprehensively explaining the process of the first stage of the Geneva Conference with a large number of ironclad facts, and powerfully shattered this attempt by Western countries, especially the United States, to reverse black and white.

The first stage of the Geneva Conference mainly discussed the issue of a German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. As is well known, the tension that exists in Europe today and the threat to European peace are inseparable from the fact that the United States, Britain, and France are taking advantage of the abnormal situation of not having a German peace treaty and the division of Germany to actively support West German militarism. Therefore, reaching an agreement on the issue of concluding a German peace treaty to prevent West German militarization and promote the rapprochement of the two Germanys to form a unified, peace-loving Germany has become an important task of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, contrary to the Soviet Union's efforts to reach an agreement on this issue, Western countries rejected the draft German peace treaty proposed by the Soviet Union without consideration. They also failed to put forward their own draft treaty from beginning to end, but hastily proposed a so-called "package plan" to first "unify Germany" and then conclude a peace treaty. Even the West itself may not think this plan is feasible, because they inextricably link the issue of "unifying Germany" with many other complex international issues, and fundamentally violate the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the German people. Such a plan can only show that Western countries have no intention of concluding a peace treaty, nor do they want to unify Germany. The crux of the Geneva Conference's failure to reach any agreement on the German peace treaty issue lies here.

In the discussion of the West Berlin issue, Western countries also played the same role in obstructing the reaching of an agreement. Despite the Soviet Union's repeated concessions to certain Western wishes and efforts to reach an agreement, Western countries have always insisted that the Soviet Union agree to indefinitely fix the occupation system in West Berlin. West Berlin under Western occupation has become a hotbed of tension in Europe. One of the purposes of the Soviet Union's proposal to convene the Geneva Conference was to eliminate this abnormal situation. Can anyone naively believe that the Soviet Foreign Minister went to Geneva in order to maintain the West Berlin occupation system?

Of course, the most important thing is not to determine who is responsible for the failure to reach an agreement in the first stage of the Geneva Conference, but how the participants in the conference intend to treat the work of the next stage of the conference. On this point, the recent remarks of Western leaders cannot but attract people's attention. Their continued insistence on staying in West Berlin shows that they do not intend to change their position after the resumption of the Geneva Conference. They accuse the Soviet Union of lacking sincerity in negotiations, foreshadowing that they are laying the groundwork for undermining the work of the next stage of the conference. It should be particularly pointed out that West Germany, with the apparent consent of the United States, Britain, and France, decided to hold presidential elections in West Berlin. Just as the West Berlin issue is on the agenda of the Geneva Conference, the United States, Britain, and France deliberately allow West Germany to run to West Berlin, which has nothing to do with it, to elect a president. This is obviously a provocative action, and people can only think that this is an action by Western countries to increase the tense atmosphere for the work of the Geneva Conference.

There are still about ten days before the resumption of the Geneva Conference. Western countries still have the opportunity to rationally consider the serious consequences of undermining the Geneva Conference. Foreign Minister Gromyko sincerely said in his statement: "May the Western governments use the opportunity of the Geneva Conference recess to more rationally assess the Soviet Union's proposals, abandon those unrealistic attempts that hinder the achievement of negotiations, and prepare from their own side to reach an agreement in order to normalize the Berlin situation and pave the way for reconciliation with Germany." This is the expectation of the Soviet government, and also the expectation of all countries and people who are willing to see the Geneva Conference achieve positive results.

    苏联政府的合理期望
    本报评论员
    日内瓦外长会议于6月20日宣布休会三星期以来，西方国家散布了大量歪曲会议第一阶段真实情况的言论。它们企图把这一阶段会议没有取得各国人民所期望的结果归咎于苏联，而装做它们倒是想解决问题的样子。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯于6月28日发表了关于日内瓦外长会议的声明，以大量的铁的事实，全面地说明了日内瓦会议第一阶段的过程，有力地粉碎了西方国家、特别是美国这种颠倒黑白的企图。
    日内瓦会议第一阶段主要讨论了对德和约问题和西柏林问题。如所周知，今天欧洲所存在的紧张局势、欧洲和平所遭受的威胁，是同美、英、法利用没有对德和约和德国分裂的不正常情况而积极扶植西德军国主义这一事实分不开的。因此，在缔结对德和约的问题上达成协议，以阻止西德军国主义化，促进两个德国的接近而形成统一的爱好和平的德国，就成为日内瓦外长会议的一项重要任务。但是，在这个问题上，同苏联的争取达成协议的努力正相反，西方国家不加考虑地拒绝苏联提出的对德和约草案，又自始至终不提出自己的和约草案，却极其草率地提了一个先“统一德国”后缔结和约的所谓“一揽子计划”。这个计划，即使西方自己也未必能认为是行得通的，因为它们把“统一德国”的问题同其他许多复杂的国际问题不可分解地扭结在一起，并且根本违反了关于德国人民的内政不容干涉的原则。这样一个计划，只能说明西方国家既无意于缔结和约，也不想统一德国。日内瓦会议未能在对德和约问题上达成任何协议，其症结就在这里。
    在关于西柏林问题的讨论过程中，西方国家也起了同样的阻挠达成协议的作用。尽管苏联一再迁就西方的某些愿望，努力争取达成协议；西方国家却始终坚持要苏联同意把西柏林的占领制度无限期地固定下来。在西方占领下的西柏林已经成为欧洲紧张局势的策源地，苏联倡议召开日内瓦会议的目的之一就是要消除这种不正常的状况，难道能有任何人天真地认为，苏联外长到日内瓦去就是为的要保持西柏林占领制度吗？
    当然，最重要的还不在于判明日内瓦会议第一阶段未能达成协议的责任何在，而在于会议的参加者打算怎样对待下一阶段会议的工作。在这一点上，西方国家领导人最近的言论不能不引起人们的注意。他们继续坚持要赖在西柏林不走的声明，表明他们并不打算在日内瓦会议复会后改变立场。他们反咬苏联无谈判诚意，预示着他们正在为破坏下一阶段会议的工作埋下伏笔。特别应当指出的是，西德在显然得到美、英、法的同意下，决定在西柏林举行总统选举。正当西柏林问题列在日内瓦会议议程上的时候，美、英、法故意容许西德跑到同它毫无关系的西柏林去选举总统，当然是明显的挑衅行动，人们只能认为这是西方国家的为了给日内瓦会议的工作增加紧张气氛的行动。
    现在离日内瓦会议复会还有十来天，西方国家还有机会理智地考虑如果破坏日内瓦会议，将会得到什么样的严重后果。葛罗米柯外长在他的声明中诚恳地说：“但愿西方国家政府利用日内瓦会议休会的机会更合理地估计苏联的建议，放弃那些妨碍谈判取得成就的不现实的企图，从自己这一方面准备达成协议，以使柏林局势正常化并为同德国的媾和开辟道路。”这是苏联政府的期望，也是一切愿意看到日内瓦会议取得积极成就的各国人民的期望。
