Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 25th: Upper strata figures from various parts of Tibet have expressed their support for the resolution on carrying out democratic reforms throughout the region passed by the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. They unanimously thanked the Central Government for its decision to adopt a redemption policy towards landlords who did not participate in the rebellion during the democratic reforms, and expressed their determination to use practical actions to welcome the reforms, thoroughly abolish the serf system, and promote the progress of Tibetan society and the prosperity of the nation.

	Deimo·Danzeng Jiacuo, the Living Buddha of Deimo Lhakhang (monastery name) in Lhasa, said in a conversation: The implementation of the redemption policy for upper strata figures who did not participate in the rebellion is the care and concern of the Party and the state for the upper strata. I am sincerely grateful to the Central Government and the great Chinese Communist Party for this. Deimo Lhakhang was bombarded by the rebels during the rebellion. Deimo Living Buddha accused the rebels of their crimes of destroying religion and warmly praised the Party and the state's policy of freedom of religious belief.

	Patriotic upper and middle-level figures in the Zedang area unanimously expressed their determination to conscientiously implement the resolution of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region on carrying out democratic reforms at a symposium on the 20th. Gagyi Gyung·Dundrup Tsering, deputy director of the Shannan Military Control Commission, whose manor was burned down by the rebels for opposing the rebellion, said: "I fully support the resolution on carrying out democratic reforms. I am of noble birth and have exploited the people a lot in the past. Now, the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region has decided not to hold us accountable for the past during the reform and to implement a redemption policy, and to give consideration to patriotic and progressive people in terms of politics and life. We express our heartfelt thanks. Now that the resolution on carrying out reform has been passed, it is a great thing for the broad masses of working people, and we should be happy for the liberation of the working people." Gesang Tsering, the headman of Gyasa (place name), who was beaten to the point of near death by the rebels for actively supporting the People's Liberation Army during the suppression of the rebellion, said that in the past he handled the distribution of corvee labor every day and saw the heavy corvee labor of the former Tibetan local government causing families to be broken and people to suffer unspeakable pain. Now, the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region has resolved to abolish the Ula corvee labor, and he expressed his heartfelt support. Ngawang, the Xiidui (manor agent) of Zhaxitong Moxika, is the manager of the manor of Lhalu·Tsewang Dorje, one of the rebel leaders. He said: "The development of the situation in the past few months has made him realize that the Tibetan upper-level reactionary group and the barbaric serf system are doomed to perish. If he continues to serve the upper-level reactionaries as in the past, there is no way out. In the future, he can only transform himself well and work for the people to find a way out."

	In the Tagong and Heihe areas, many headmen actively expressed their support after hearing the news that the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region had passed a resolution on carrying out democratic reforms. More than 40 tribal headmen in the Heihe area who were attending a meeting in Heihe City said: In the past, they were sorry for the working people, and in the future, they must stand with the working people and do their part for the democratic reform.

	People from all walks of life, both monks and lay people, in the Gyantse area held symposiums one after another to celebrate the immediate implementation of democratic reforms in the Tibetan area. Jiga·Phuntsok Tsetan, deputy director of the Gyantse Military Control Commission, said: "I was originally a member of the exploiting class. In the future, I will resolutely implement the resolution of the Preparatory Committee and work hard to repay the people and the care of the Party and the government." Middle and upper-level lamas and nuns from more than 20 monasteries near Gyantse also held a symposium. They pointed out that the purpose of Buddhism is to save all living beings, and only by implementing democratic reforms can the Tibetan people escape from the sea of suffering of the feudal serf system. Bata Qing, a member of the Council of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China and the upper-level lama of Pelkor Chode Monastery, the largest temple in Gyantse, said: "According to the scriptures, religion should not have political privileges, and it is not allowed by the religious rules for lamas to lend money at high interest rates and exploit the people." Sang'a Tuduo, a lama from Pelkor Chode Monastery, said: "In order to purify religion and promote religious rules, we must abolish the privileges and exploitation of monasteries and restore the original appearance of monasteries that only carry out religious activities."

    西藏上层人士纷纷拥护民主改革
    感谢中央对未参加叛乱的领主实行赎买政策
    新华社拉萨25日电　西藏各地的上层人士纷纷表示拥护西藏自治区筹委会第二次全体会议关于在全区进行民主改革的决议。他们同声感谢中央决定在民主改革中对未参加叛乱的领主采取赎买政策，并且表示要用实际行动来迎接改革，彻底废除农奴制度，促进西藏社会的进步和民族的繁荣。
    拉萨市德茂拉章（寺院名）的活佛德茂·丹致加错在谈话中说：对未参加叛乱的上层人士实行赎买政策，这是党和国家对上层人士的照顾和关怀，为此我衷心感激中央和伟大的中国共产党。德茂拉章在叛乱中曾遭到叛匪的炮击，德茂活佛向记者控诉了叛匪破坏宗教的罪行，并且热烈赞扬党和国家的宗教信仰自由政策。
    泽当地区的爱国上中层人士，20日在一次座谈会上一致表示要认真执行自治区筹委会关于进行民主改革的决议。因为反对叛乱而被叛匪烧毁了庄园的山南军管会副主任噶炯·顿珠次仁说：“我完全拥护进行民主改革的决议，我是贵族出身，过去对人民有过很多剥削，现在自治区筹委会决定在改革中不咎既往，实行赎买政策，对爱国进步人士在政治上和生活上都给予照顾，我们表示衷心感谢。现在通过了进行改革的决议，对广大劳动人民是天大的好事，我们应该为劳动人民的解放感到高兴。”平叛期间因为积极支援解放军曾被叛匪打得死去活来的甲萨（地名）的头人格桑次旺说，他过去天天经手派差，看到原西藏地方政府的苛重的差役把百姓弄得家破人亡，痛苦不堪。现在，自治区筹委会决议废除乌拉差役，他表示衷心拥护。扎西通墨溪卡的溪堆（庄园主代理人）阿旺是叛匪头子之一拉鲁·策旺仁增的妻子的庄园管理人，他说：“过去几个月的形势发展，使他认识到西藏上层反动集团和野蛮的农奴制度注定要灭亡。如果像过去一样继续为上层反动分子服务是没有出路的，今后只有好好改造自己，为人民办事，才有出路。”
    在塔工和黑河地区，许多头人听到自治区筹委会通过进行民主改革决议的消息以后，都积极表示拥护。正在黑河市开会的黑河地区四十多个部落的头人，表示：过去他们对不起劳动人民，今后一定要同劳动人民站在一起，为民主改革尽一分力量。
    江孜地区各阶层僧俗人民，纷纷举行座谈会，庆祝立即在西藏地区进行民主改革。江孜军管会副主任吉卡·平错茨丹说：“我原是剥削阶级的一分子，今后我要坚决贯彻筹委会的决议，努力做好工作，以报答人民，报答党和政府的关怀。”江孜附近二十多个寺院的中上层喇嘛和尼姑也举行了座谈会，他们指出，佛教的宗旨是普渡众生，而只有实行民主改革，西藏人民才能脱离封建农奴制度的苦海。中国佛教协会西藏分会理事、江孜最大寺庙白居寺的上层喇嘛巴塔青说：“按照经典，宗教不应有政治特权，喇嘛放高利贷剥削人民是教规所不能允许的。”白居寺喇嘛桑阿图多说：“为了纯洁宗教，宏扬教规，我们一定要废除寺院的特权和剥削，恢复寺院只进行宗教活动的本来面目。”
