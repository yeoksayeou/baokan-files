    Flowers of Sino-Soviet Friendship
    ——Revisiting the Friendship Farm
    By our correspondent Ma Xinren
    After the car passed Xinglong Town, a stretch of green wheat rippled across the land. Although there were still thirty-odd li to the general headquarters, we had already entered the Friendship Farm area.
    Five years ago, when the Sino-Soviet surveying experts first came here, we sent out the first news about the construction of the farm. At that time, a jeep would be swallowed up by weeds as soon as it drove into the wasteland. Soon after, the complete set of machinery and equipment donated by the Soviet Union completely plowed over the 330,000 mu of wasteland. This all happened in just over a year. The ninety-four tractors投入开荒 (throwing into reclamation) transformed what was originally a wilderness into an agricultural city surrounded by a sea of wheat.
    However, these figures are no longer sufficient to illustrate the power of mechanization. This year is the fifth production year since the farm was established, and the cultivated area has expanded to 700,500 mu, with only thirty-six more tractors added. On the smooth farm roads, the car sped towards the general headquarters at a speed of 40 kilometers per hour. This place is like a small industrial city. The newly built five-story flour mill has just been completed and can produce 15,000 tons of flour a year. Around the flour mill are food processing plants, chemical plants, and woodworking factories. Next to the machine repair shop, a small steel mill and a satellite machine processing factory have been built. Twelve electric incubators are working simultaneously in the chicken coops. From the general headquarters to the branch farms, to each production team, everyone is busy building pigsties. The farm already has more than 20,000 pigs and 30,000 chickens, and will continue to develop vigorously this year. How much manpower is needed to manage so many businesses? I asked Comrade Liu Baoqing, the secretary of the farm's Party committee. He said: "In the countryside, it would take hundreds of thousands of people just to cultivate so much land. But in Friendship Farm, including all kinds of production, there are only 13,000 laborers."
    The power of mechanization has not yet been fully exploited. Secretary Liu also told me about a new situation: This year, the farm is consciously conducting experiments to fully utilize the efficiency of machinery in the Second Production Team of the Fifth Branch Farm. This production team cultivates 19,500 mu of land, equipped with seven tractors, six combine harvesters, six seeders, as well as plows, harrows, rollers, and so on. Only fifty people are used to cultivate the land, an average of 390 mu per person. Compared with those places where only manpower and old tools are used, with each person cultivating one mu of land, this production team is equivalent to one person doing the work of 390 people. When visitors from outside hear this astonishing figure, they all want to see for themselves how they accomplish such a large workload.
    When I arrived at this production team, the large-scale mechanized spring plowing was already over. The wheat that had emerged from the soil was two or three inches high, like a huge green carpet covering the 12,150 mu of wheat fields. In the distance, a tractor was dragging farm tools. The production team leader told me: "It only took eight days to sow this wheat. The wheat fields are all deeply plowed and densely planted. Base fertilizer was applied before sowing, and now we are applying topdressing, another thirteen to twenty catties of chemical fertilizer per mu." He laughed when he heard me ask why there was no one to be seen applying fertilizer in the fields: "Of the fifty people who cultivate the land, thirty are tractor drivers and farm implement operators, and the remaining twenty are fuelers, statisticians, and farm workers. We use machines for spring planting, summer weeding, and autumn harvesting, trying to minimize the use of manpower. The same goes for fertilization. If we had to send fertilizer to the fields by hand and then load the fertilizer boxes with manpower, how much labor would that take!"
    Only eight people participated in the fertilization. In the courtyard of the team headquarters, three people mixed chemical fertilizer and loaded it onto trucks. The driver drove the truck quickly to the fields. The fertilizer spreader was modified from a seeder. A device similar to a winch was added to the truck's cargo box. Farm implement operators and the driver did not need to lift a finger, and the fertilizer automatically flowed into the fertilizer box. It only took five or six minutes to fill the three fertilizer boxes. When the tractor started, it could fertilize seventy-two rows of wheat at a time.
    The power of mechanized production at Friendship Farm has already brought changes to the surrounding rural areas. This year, the land of three townships has been entirely cultivated by the farm's machines. Once mechanized production appeared, it immediately changed the face of production. Previously, looking at the boundary of the farm, on the farm side, no matter what the crops were, they were endless large plots, vertically and horizontally aligned, with clear boundaries; the farmland outside the farm was just the opposite, with small plots interspersed with scattered wasteland, and the seeds of weeds were blown into the crops in autumn. This spring, the farm's tractor fleet replowed the 120,000 mu of land in the three townships that had not been plowed deep enough last autumn. Many small roads that wasted land in the fields were plowed away. Outside the villages and towns was a black carpet like planting green velvet.
    The loose new field roads were very difficult to walk on. When I arrived in front of Zhian Village, I saw a new scene: all the people working in the fields were women. An old man was leisurely sitting on the side of the field sunbathing, with a wooden sign saying "No Passing" inserted behind him. It turned out that he was sitting on a past "Mao Dao" (small path). Now, according to the requirements of mechanized farming, the roads have also changed. He said to me: "The farm cultivated the land for us, and the wheat and soybeans were all planted by machines. There is much less work in the fields. All that's left is to spread chemical fertilizer on the wheat, which is enough for women to do."
    Due to mechanized cultivation, the three townships have been able to free up a large number of surplus laborers to engage in water conservancy construction and sideline production. Four large reservoirs are being built around Friendship Farm. On the construction site of the Happiness Reservoir, a house has been built on the hillside next to the reservoir, where a dozen young people live and operate an orchard. Beyond the mountains, a breeding farm is being built to raise pigs, cattle, and sheep. This year, the farmers also plan to raise tussah silkworms in the oak forests.

    中苏友谊的花朵
    ——重访友谊农场
    本报记者　马新仁
    车过兴隆镇，一片碧绿的麦浪漫卷了大地。离总场部还有三十多里，但是我们已经进入友谊农场区了。
    五年前中苏勘测场址的专家刚来到这里时，我们发出了建场的第一条消息。那时吉普车钻进荒地立即就被野草淹没了。不久，由苏联赠送的全套机器设备，将三十三万亩荒地全部耕翻过来。前后只不过一年多一点的时间。投入开荒的九十四台拖拉机，就把原来一片荒地，变成了一座麦海包围的农业城。
    但是，这些数字现在已不足以说明机械化的威力了。今年是建场的第五个生产年度，这里耕地面积已经扩大到七十万零五千亩，拖拉机才陆续增添了三十六台。在平坦的场内公路上，汽车以每小时四十公里的速度跑进总场部。这里就像一个小型工业城市。新建的五层楼高的面粉厂刚刚完工，一年可以生产一万五千吨面粉。面粉厂的周围，有食品加工厂、化工厂、木器厂。在机器修理厂的旁边，又建立了小型炼钢厂和机器加工的卫星厂。鸡舍里十二台电气孵卵器同时工作。从总场部到分场，到每一个生产队，都在忙着修建猪舍，全场已有两万多口猪，三万只鸡，今年还要继续大发展。经营这样多事业要多少人力？我问过农场党委书记刘宝庆同志。他说：在农村单是种那样多地也得十几万人。可是在友谊农场，各种生产都算在内，只有一万三千名劳动力。
    机械化的威力这还没有充分发挥。刘书记又向我讲了这样一个新情况：今年，农场有意识的在五分场第二生产队进行充分发挥机械效能的试验。这个生产队耕种面积一万九千五百亩，配备了七台拖拉机，六台联合收割机，六台播种机，还有犁、耙、镇压器等等。而种地的人只用五十个，平均每人种地三百九十亩。和那些只用人力和旧工具每人种地一亩的地方比较，这个生产队就等于一个人干了三百九十人的活。外来参观的人一听到这个惊人的数字，都想亲自去看一看他们是怎样完成这么大的工作量。
    我赶到这个生产队的时候，大规模的机械化春耕已经过去了。出土的麦子长有两三寸高，就像一张巨大的绿色地毯铺盖在一万二千一百五十亩的麦田里。远处一台拖拉机拖着农具。生产队长向我说：播种这些小麦只用了八天时间，麦田全是深耕密植，播种前都施了底肥，现在正在追肥，每亩地再施十三斤到二十斤化学肥料。他听到我问为什么田间看不到有人在施肥的时候，就笑了起来：“我们五十个人种地，三十个是拖拉机手、农具手，下余的二十个是加油员、统计员和农工，春种、夏锄、秋收都用机器，尽量少用人力。施肥也这样。要用人往地里送肥料、再用人力把肥料装进施肥箱，那得用多少人工啊！”
    全部参加施肥的人只有八个。队部的院子里，三个人搅拌化学肥料，装上汽车。司机开着车子飞快地来到田间。施肥机是播种机改装的。汽车的车箱加上一个类似卷扬机的设备，农具手和司机都不用动手，肥料就自动流进施肥箱里，只消五六分钟的时间，就可以把三个施肥箱装满。拖拉机开动起来，一次就能够给七十二行麦子追上肥料。
    友谊农场机械化生产的威力已经给它周围的农村带来了变化。今年有三个乡的土地全部由农场的机器代耕。机械化生产一经出现，立即改变着生产面貌。以前在农场的边界上两边一望，农场里不论是什么庄稼，都是一望无边的大片，纵横整齐，地界分明；场外的耕地却如此相反，田块之间夹杂着零星的荒地，野草的种子到秋天全被吹进庄稼地里。今年春天，农场的拖拉机群在播种同时，将三个乡去年秋翻深度不够的十二万亩土地全部重耕了一遍。原来田间许多浪费土地的小路一起被耕断了。村屯外面是一片像栽绿绒的黑色的地毯。
    松松的田间新路走起来非常费劲。到了治安屯的前面我看到了一种新的景象，在田间劳动的全是妇女。一个老汉悠闲地坐在田边上晒太阳，他身后插着一根“禁止通行”的木牌。原来他坐在一条过去的“毛道”上。现在按着机械化耕作的要求，道路也改变了。他对我说：“农场给我们代耕，麦子、大豆都是机器种的。地里的活少多了，就剩下给麦子撒化学肥料，给妇女干就行了。”
    由于机械化的代耕，三个乡都能拿出大批多余的劳动力去兴修水利和经营副业生产。在友谊农场的四周，正在修建四个大水库。在幸福水库工地上，水库旁的山坡上盖起了一座房子，十几个青年住在那里，经营一片果园，翻过山去，那里正在建设一个饲养场，饲养猪、牛、羊。今年农民还打算在柞树林里放养柞蚕哩。
