Stop! Do Not Persecute Glezos

Eighteen years ago, when the news that Glezos had torn down the fascist flag on the ancient Acropolis in Athens reached China, millions of Chinese people who were heroically resisting Japanese imperialism were all overjoyed, regarding Glezos's heroic action as an example of our common anti-fascist struggle. From then on, the Chinese people cherished Glezos and the heroic deeds of his people in their hearts. Precisely because of this, eighteen years later, when news of the Greek reactionaries wanting to murder Glezos reached Athens, how could we suppress the anger in our hearts!

Eighteen years is but a fleeting moment in human history, but during this period, the world situation has undergone extraordinary changes. We deeply remember that the Greek people, who had fought heroically during the anti-fascist German occupation and liberated their motherland, suffered armed intervention from British and American imperialism after the war. The Greek people then heroically launched a struggle against foreign armed intervention, persisting for more than three years.

In the Greek people's just struggle, Glezos's name and his unremitting struggle have always played an important role. Now the Greek government has agreed to turn Greece into an American missile base and springboard for aggression, and is intensifying the persecution of democratic and progressive forces within the country. The Greek government's trial and attempted murder of national hero Glezos is a step in its frantic attack on Greek democratic and progressive forces.

The "crime" that the Greek reactionaries have imposed on Glezos is arrogant and foolish. In one "trial" of Glezos, a Greek prosecutor actually said that Glezos's globally acclaimed patriotic heroic act eighteen years ago was a "despicable and shameful act" and therefore "should be beheaded." Is this a manifestation of the Greek reactionaries' strength? Anyone who knows a little history will give a firm negative answer. If the Greek reactionaries want to rely on the support of American imperialism, attempting to plant a new American-made swastika flag on the ancient Acropolis of Athens, it will surely be torn down and smashed to pieces by the Greek people in the same way.

Look, the wave of worldwide righteous people supporting Glezos is surging, and it will drown the stubborn despots. The banner of freedom held high by Glezos when he tore down the Nazi swastika once ignited a raging flame, burying the fascist German occupiers who ran rampant in Greece. This shows that no force can uproot the banner of freedom.

We want to shout loudly: Stop! Do not persecute Glezos!

### 住手！不准迫害格列索斯

    住手！不准迫害格列索斯
    十八年前，当格列索斯撕下雅典古城堡上的法西斯旗帜的消息传到中国时，正在英勇抗击日本帝国主义者的千百万中国人民，莫不欢欣鼓舞，把格列索斯的英雄行动看作是我们反法西斯共同斗争的一个榜样。从那时起，我国人民把格列索斯和他的人民的英雄事迹珍藏在心头。正是因为这样，十八年后的今天，当雅典传出希腊反动派要杀害格列索斯的消息时，我们怎能抑制住内心的愤怒！
    十八年在人类历史上不过是“白驹过隙”，但是这段时期里，世界局势却起了异乎寻常的变化。我们深深记得，曾经在反法西斯德国占领时期英勇战斗，解放了自己的祖国的希腊人民，在战后受到了英美帝国主义的武装干涉，而希腊人民又英勇地展开了反对外国武装干涉的斗争，坚持了三年多。
    在希腊人民的正义斗争中，格列索斯的名字和他的不懈的斗争，一直起着重要的作用。现在希腊政府答应把希腊变成美国的导弹基地和侵略跳板，并在国内加紧迫害民主进步力量。希腊政府审讯和企图杀害民族英雄格列索斯，就是它向希腊民主进步力量疯狂进攻的一个步骤。
    希腊反动派加给格列索斯的
  “罪名”，是狂妄而愚蠢的。希腊法庭在一次“审讯”格列索斯时，一个检察官居然说十八年前格列索斯那次誉满全球的爱国主义的英雄事迹是“卑鄙可耻的行为”，因而“应该人头落地”。难道这是希腊反动派的强大表现吗？懂得一点历史的人都会给予断然否定的回答。希腊反动派如果想依靠美帝国主义的支撑，妄图把一面美制的新卐字旗插上雅典古老的城堡上，一定要被希腊人民照样撕下，把它撕得粉碎。
    看吧，全世界正义人类声援格列索斯的浪潮在汹涌，它会淹没一意孤行的独夫们。格列索斯撕掉纳粹卐字旗时高举的自由旗帜，曾经燃起了熊熊的火焰，埋葬了横行希腊的法西斯德国占领者，这就说明再没有任何势力能够拔掉自由的旗帜。
    我们要大喝一声：住手！不准迫害格列索斯！
