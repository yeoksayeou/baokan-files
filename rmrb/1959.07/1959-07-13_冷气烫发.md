The luxurious hair salon in Guangzhou's Central District has recently been using a self-made cold wave lotion for perms, which saves electricity and reduces the trouble of customers having to clip on many electric curlers or suffering from excessive heat during electric perms. The charge for cold wave perms is about five jiao higher than for electric perms, but it is more comfortable and cooler, which is quite popular with customers.

    冷气烫发
    广州市中区豪华理发店最近用一种自己制成的冷气药水烫发，节约了用电，也减少顾客在电烫时要夹上许多电发夹或受电过热的麻烦。冷气药水烫发的收费比电力烫发大约高五角钱，但是烫起来比较舒服凉快，颇受顾客欢迎。
