    Dense Fruit Set in Dangshan Pears
    The famous Dangshan pears of Jiangsu are bearing fruit densely this year, promising a bumper harvest. In the Liangli People's Commune, which is rich in Su pears, over 36,300 pear trees are bearing fruit, each tree laden with fruit. If we estimate that each tree produces 250 jin of pears, it is estimated that the commune will produce more than 9 million jin of pears this year, an increase of several times compared to last year.
    Currently, the staff of the Dangshan Horticultural Farm and the members of the People's Commune are actively arranging transportation and packaging materials in order to transport the large, sweet, and delicious Dangshan pears to the cities in a timely manner.

    砀山梨挂果稠密
    著名的江苏砀山梨，今年挂果稠密，丰收在望。盛产酥梨的良梨人民公社，今年结果梨树三万六千三百多株，株株果实累累。若以每株产梨二百五十斤计算，估计今年全社将产梨九百多万斤，比去年约增产数倍以上。
    目前，砀山园艺场的职工和人民公社社员们，为了及时把又大又甜、味道鲜美的砀山梨运往城市，正在积极安排运输工具、包装等用品。
