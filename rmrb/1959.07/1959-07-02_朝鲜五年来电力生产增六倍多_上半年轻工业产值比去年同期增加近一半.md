Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th - According to news reports here: North Korean Minister of Electricity, Kim Doo-sam, in his report "On Further Developing the Electrical Industry" at the Central Committee Plenary Meeting of the Workers' Party of Korea on the 29th, pointed out that North Korea's electricity production last year was 7.5 times that of 1953, exceeding the pre-Korean War level by 27%. The output value of the electrical machinery industry last year reached 7.9 times that of the pre-war period.

The report stated that during the five-year post-war period, North Korea restored and renovated power generation equipment with a total generating capacity of 1.36 million kilowatts, including the Supung Hydroelectric Power Station and the Changjin River Hydroelectric Power Station. It also restored and expanded 5,000 kilometers of power transmission and distribution lines and 400,000 kVA of transformer equipment. In addition, more than 800 small power stations have been built in various locations in recent months.

The report mentioned that North Korea needs to develop electricity-intensive electric steelmaking, iron smelting, and the chemical industry in the coming years, accelerate the development of the entire industry, and realize the electrification of railways.

The report stated that in order to meet the ever-increasing needs for electricity in socialist construction, vigorously promote the development of socialist industrialization, it is necessary to comprehensively complete the technical and cultural revolutions, and continue to vigorously develop the electric power industry, aiming to achieve an annual electricity production of 20 billion kilowatt-hours in the near future.

The report said that in order to complete this arduous task proposed by the Party ahead of schedule, it is necessary to strengthen and consolidate the existing power industry base and launch a nationwide movement to build new power stations and power transmission and distribution equipment.

The report stated that North Korea has more than one million kilowatts of hydropower resources, and the coal reserves are also very rich. In the capital construction of the electric power industry, the construction of hydroelectric power stations and thermal power stations should be coordinated. In addition to concentrating efforts on large-scale power base construction, small and medium-sized power station construction should be carried out as a nationwide movement.

The report said that the Turujiang Power Station should be completed quickly, the Yunbong Power Station and the Jiangjie Youth Power Station should be completed in 1962, and the Xitou Hydropower Station with a generating capacity of 400,000 kilowatts and the Putian Power Station with a generating capacity of 1 million kilowatts should also be built. Thermal power plants should be built in important coal mining areas, and thermal power plants mainly for heating and supplemented by power generation should be built in major cities.

In addition, small and medium-sized power stations with a total generating capacity of 130,000 kilowatts should be built before 1961. The electrification of the countryside should be basically completed before August 15th next year, the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

While vigorously building power stations, it is also necessary to expand thousands of kilometers of power transmission and distribution lines and corresponding substations. Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th - According to the Korean Central News Agency, the total output value of factories and enterprises under the North Korean Ministry of Light Industry in the first half of this year (up to June 27) increased by 46% compared with the same period last year. Among the main products, cotton yarn increased by 2,795 tons compared with the same period last year, textiles increased by more than 10,042,900 meters, and paper increased by 760 tons.

The production plan for the first half of this year for factories and enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry has been completed on June 27.

In order to produce 70% more products this year than last year, the employees of the North Korean light industry department have actively launched an invention and creation movement and strived to improve equipment utilization. For example, the employees of various textile factories have manufactured more than 400 textile machines themselves in the first five months of this year, expanding the production equipment.

The quality of products in the light industry sector has also been significantly improved in the first half of this year. Textile factories, porcelain factories, food factories, and other factories have produced more than 300 kinds of special products with particularly good quality. At present, the employees are striving to ensure that the quality of 60% of the products reaches the level of advanced countries within this year.

    朝鲜五年来电力生产增六倍多
    上半年轻工业产值比去年同期增加近一半
    新华社平壤30日电　据此间报纸消息：朝鲜电气相金斗三29日在朝鲜劳动党中央全会上所作的“关于进一步发展电气工业”的报告指出，去年朝鲜的电力等于1953年的七点五倍，超过朝鲜战争前水平27％。电机工业去年的产值达到战前的七点九倍。
    报告说，朝鲜在战后五年多期间，恢复和改建了水丰发电站、长津江发电站等总发电量为一百三十六万瓩的发电设备；恢复和扩大了五千公里长的送配电线和四十万千伏安的变电设备。此外在最近几个月内各地还建设了八百多所小型发电站。
    报告谈到，朝鲜要在最近几年内发展用电很多的电气炼钢炼铁和化学工业，并加速整个工业的发展，实现铁路的电气化。
    报告说，为了适应社会主义建设对电力的日益增长的需要，有力地推动社会主义工业化的发展，必须全面地完成技术革命和文化革命，必须继续大力发展电力工业，要在最近的将来达到年产二百亿度电力的水平。
    报告说，为了提前完成党提出的这一艰巨任务，必须加强和巩固现有的电力工业基地，并展开全民性的运动，建设新的发电站和送电配电设备。
    报告说，朝鲜有一百万瓩以上的水力发电资源，煤的蕴藏量也很丰富。在电力工业的基本建设上要把水力发电站和火力发电站的建设配合起来；另外在集中力量进行大规模的电力基地的建设的同时，要以全民性的运动进行中小规模的电站建设。
    报告说，要迅速建成秃鲁江发电站，在1962年要建成云峰发电站和江界青年发电站，还要建设发电容量四十万瓩的西头水电站和发电容量一百万瓩的普天电站。在重要煤矿区要兴建火力发电站，在主要城市兴建以取暖为主、发电为辅的火力发电站。
    另外，在1961年以前要建成总发电容量达十三万瓩的中小电站。在明年“八一五”朝鲜解放十五周年前要基本成完农村的电气化。
    在大力兴建电站的同时，还要扩建数千公里长的送配电线和相应的变电所。新华社平壤30日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，朝鲜轻工业部所属工厂企业今年上半年（到6月27日止）的生产总值比去年同期增加了46％。主要的产品中，棉纱比去年同期增加了二千七百九十五吨，纺织品增加了一千零四十二万九千多公尺，纸增加了七百六十吨。
    轻工业部所属工厂企业的今年上半年生产计划已在6月27日完成。
    朝鲜轻工业部门的职工为了在今年生产比去年多70％的产品，积极展开了发明创造运动，努力提高设备利用率。如各纺织厂的职工在今年头五个月中就自己制造了四百多台纺织机械，扩大了生产设备。
    今年上半年轻工业部门的产品质量也有了显著的提高，各纺织厂、瓷器厂、食品厂等生产了三百多种质量特别好的特制品。目前职工们正为在今年内使60％的产品质量达到先进国家的水平而努力。
