Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 30th. According to the Indian Press Trust, the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of India, after holding a two-day meeting in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala, passed a resolution on the 27th, rejecting Prime Minister Nehru's proposal for a re-election in Kerala.

The resolution stated that Nehru's proposal "is merely putting a democratic cloak on the discriminatory demands of the opposition parties who want to achieve their goals through illegal means. It actually means that, taking advantage of the opposition to the Communist government, the Communist government is not allowed to complete its term as stipulated by the constitution."

The current Kerala government was established in April 1957. According to the Indian constitution, the term of a state government is five years.

The resolution also pointed out that in the recent elections for village councils and municipal institutions in Kerala, the Communist Party of India won more seats; the people in the state support the Land Relations Act and the Education Act. These facts "show that the Communist Party's mass influence has increased in the past two years, rather than weakened as the opposition claims." The resolution emphasized that "therefore, there is no question of the Kerala government resigning."

The resolution expressed support for the state government's approach to dealing with the opposition's instigation. It also called on Indian democratic public opinion to "oppose these tricks used by the opposition forces in Kerala, which are being encouraged by the Congress Party Central Committee."

According to newspaper reports, the National Committee of the Communist Party of India will hold an emergency plenary session in Trivandrum on July 13 to discuss the situation in Kerala.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 30th. The Congress Party Central Parliamentary Board meeting held in Delhi on the 29th passed a resolution recommending that the Kerala government hold a general election.

The resolution believes that the state government "now does not represent the opinions of the majority in the state." It said, "Due to the widespread and almost indignant opposition to the state government, the situation in Kerala has become very critical." "A government that is challenged in this way and faces such widespread and strong opposition, it is best to accept this challenge and agree to hold new elections." The resolution called on the Kerala government to postpone the implementation of the Education Act and to "consult with those who oppose the law in order to find a solution acceptable to everyone." The resolution believes that the closure of schools and the sending of pickets to prevent students from attending school in Kerala are "unfortunate" practices.

Members of the Congress Party Central Parliamentary Board include Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Home Minister Desai, and Finance Minister Pant. The meeting was chaired by Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the president of the Congress Party. Some state chief ministers and Congress Party leaders from Kerala also attended the meeting.

The National Executive Committee of the Indian Praja Socialist Party passed a resolution on the 27th, attacking the Kerala government for "attempting to widely implement a reign of terror" and demanding that the state government resign "so that a new decision can be made in the election."

According to the "New Century" weekly, recently many Indian celebrities, lawyers, artists, business people, Christians and other people from all walks of life have expressed opposition to the Kerala opposition's attempt to overthrow the state government. Fifty-eight well-known people from all walks of life requested a meeting of democrats to decide on steps to oppose such incitement. A group of prominent Christian leaders issued a statement calling on Christians in Kerala to pay attention to the proposal by State Chief Minister Namboodiripad to resolve the problem through negotiations between the government and the opposition, and to consult with the government.

According to the Indian Press Trust, in the past few days, the opposition has also set up "pickets" in some cities in Kerala to prevent government employees from going to work and students from going to school. Trade union organizations such as the Congress Party's Indian National Trade Union Congress have incited some workers to strike in some factories and docks in the state.

    印共中央执委会通过决议
    拒绝在喀拉拉邦重新选举
    国大党和人民社会党要求在邦内大选
    新华社新德里30日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度共产党中央执行委员会在喀拉拉邦首府特里凡得琅举行了两天的会议以后，在27日通过决议，表示拒绝尼赫鲁总理关于在喀拉拉邦重新举行大选的建议。
    决议说，尼赫鲁的建议“只是给反对党想通过非法手段实现的有着歧视性质的要求，披上一件民主的外衣。它实际上意味着：利用有人反对共产党政府的借口，不让共产党政府任完宪法所规定的任期。”
    现任喀拉拉邦政府是1957年4月成立的，按印度宪法规定，邦政府任期五年。
    决议还指出，在喀拉拉邦内最近举行的乡评议会和市政机构的选举中，印度共产党赢得了更多的席位；邦内人民支持土地关系法案和教育法。这些事实“表明了共产党的群众影响在过去两年内增大了，而不是像反对派所说的那样减弱了”。决议强调说，“因此，根本不产生喀拉拉邦政府辞职的问题”。
    决议表示支持邦政府对付反对派的煽动活动的办法。它还呼吁印度民主舆论“反对得到国大党中央怂恿的喀拉拉邦反对派力量所采用的这些伎俩”。
    据报纸消息说，印度共产党全国委员会将于7月13日在特里凡得琅举行紧急全体会议，讨论喀拉拉邦的局势问题。
    新华社新德里30日电　在德里举行的国大党中央议会委员会会议在29日通过决议，建议喀拉拉邦政府举行大选。
    决议认为邦政府“现在毫不代表邦内多数人的意见”。它说，“由于对邦政府普遍存在的几乎是激愤的反对情绪，喀拉拉邦内的局势已经变得十分危急。”“一个政府既然遭到这样的挑战并且遭到这种广泛而强烈的反对，最好是接受这种挑战，同意举行新的选举。”决议要求喀拉拉邦政府推迟实施教育法，并且“同反对这项法律的人进行磋商，以便找到大家都可以接受的解决办法”。决议认为喀拉拉邦内关闭学校和派纠察人员阻挠学生上学是“不幸的”做法。
    国大党中央议会委员会的成员包括印度总理尼赫鲁、内政部长德赛和财政部长潘特等人。这次会议由国大党主席英迪拉·甘地夫人主持。一些邦的首席部长和喀拉拉邦的国大党领袖也参加了会议。
    印度人民社会党全国执行委员会在27日通过决议，攻击喀拉拉邦政府“企图广泛实行恐怖统治”，要求邦政府辞职，“以便在选举中作出新的决定”。
    据“新世纪”周报报道，最近有许多印度的名流、律师、艺术家、商界和基督教等各界人士表示反对喀拉拉邦反对派企图推翻邦政府的活动。各界著名人士五十八人要求召开民主人士会议来决定反对这种煽动活动的步骤。一批著名的基督教领袖发表声明，号召喀拉拉邦的基督教徒注意邦首席部长南布迪里巴德提出的通过政府和反对派的谈判来解决问题的建议，并且同政府协商。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，在过去几天内，在喀拉拉邦的一些城市中反对派还在设置“纠察人员”，阻止机关工作人员上班和学生上课。国大党的印度全国工会大会等工会组织在邦内的一些工厂和码头煽动了一些工人罢工。
