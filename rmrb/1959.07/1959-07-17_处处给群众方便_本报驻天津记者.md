    Providing Convenience to the Masses Everywhere
    Our Correspondent in Tianjin
    On Dafeng Road in the Northwest Corner of Tianjin, there is a newly painted small red door with a sign on the right that reads: "Dahuoxiang Street Living Welfare Service Station," and on the left is a detailed list of the service station's thirty-six service items. The service content is diverse: from dismantling, washing, mending clothes and socks to serving patients and taking care of children; from repairing houses and installing glass to repairing electric lights and fitting keys; from beautifying homes to writing letters on behalf of others, making clothing, and knitting sweaters. At the same time, it also helps residents move, transport coal, and carry water.
    This service station, composed of housewives and retired veteran workers, is one of the earliest social service organizations run by street residents in Tianjin. Since its opening, it has brought a lot of convenience to the workers and residents of nearby factories, institutions, and schools, and has been praised by people.
        "The Second General Affairs Section"
    Whenever the quitting time bell rings in the melting coarse wire section of the Copper Wire and Mesh Factory, a young woman with a smiling face walks into the factory. When workers see her, they say affectionately, "Look! Our general affairs section chief is here."
    This young woman is Wang Hui, a service worker from the service station's dismantling, washing, and mending group. After the establishment of the service station, it took over all the tasks of washing work clothes, gloves, shoe covers, and aprons for the melting coarse wire section. Every day, Wang Hui collects the work clothes that the workers have just taken off; before work the next day, these washed work clothes are hung in the locker room according to their numbers. When she learned that the factory warehouse had a lot of broken gloves, sleeve covers, and shoe covers piled up, she took the initiative to take these things back, cleaned and mended them in a concentrated effort, so that these things could be reused. Some gloves were so badly damaged that they could not be repaired, so they were dismantled into threads for the factory to use to wipe the machines.
    One day, the lump coal used by the factory was running out, and no one could be found to screen the coal, which was about to affect production. At this time, the factory found Wang Hui and asked her to help solve this problem. The next day, the dismantling, washing, and mending group sent four people to screen the coal, ensuring the needs of production. Therefore, the workers affectionately call this dismantling, washing, and mending group "the factory's second general affairs section."
        Treating Patients Like Relatives
    In the ward of the Second Central Hospital, there is a seriously ill four-year-old child. The young woman who accompanies and serves this child feeds the child five meals a day, takes his temperature three times, and gives him medicine three times. Every time she gives the medicine, the child always cries, and she always patiently coaxes the child to take the medicine. This young woman also records the child's daily bowel movements and actively informs the doctors and nurses of the child's condition and diet.
    Those who don't know the details may think she is the child's mother, but in fact she is Hao Shuying, a service worker from the service station, who is temporarily here to take care of the child.
    There are many examples of Hao Shuying's meticulous service to patients in this service station. Xiao Chengyan, a worker at the Comprehensive Preparation Factory, and his wife were both ill and needed someone to take care of them for eating and drinking. After the service station learned about this, it immediately sent a service worker to take care of them carefully. When Xiao Chengyan was hospitalized for surgery, the service worker also followed him to the hospital to take care of him. Xiao Chengyan and his wife recovered quickly from their illness in this way.
        The Joy of Passers-by
    It was late at night. A middle-aged man came to the Dafeng Road Service Station. This man's name was Luo Jingbo, and he had just come to Tianjin from the Northeast and was preparing to visit relatives in Jinan. After he brought his young daughter to Tianjin, he visited the child's aunt's house. But the child was unwilling to leave, and the aunt decided to let her stay for a few days. Luo Jingbo went to Jinan alone. But when he walked down the street, he remembered that he had not left any pocket money for the child; if he rushed back to send it, he was afraid of delaying the train. Just as he was thinking of a solution, he walked near the Dahuoxiang Street Living Welfare Service Station. He thought of asking the service station to send the money, but then he thought: "Will the service station take care of these things? Otherwise, I'll borrow some stationery and envelopes from them and go to the post office to mail the money."
    After Luo Jingbo entered the service station and explained his intentions, the service worker said: "You don't need to mail it, just give it to us and we'll send it for you." As soon as Luo Jingbo walked out the door, the service worker followed him closely and sent the money.

    处处给群众方便
    本报驻天津记者
    在天津西北角大丰路上，有一座新油漆的小红门，门的右边挂着一个牌子：“大伙巷街生活福利服务站”，左边贴着这个服务站的三十六项服务项目明细表。务服内容多种多样：从拆洗缝补衣袜到服侍病人，看护小孩；从修缮房屋、安装玻璃到装修电灯，修配钥匙；从美化家庭到代写书信，承制服装，编织毛衣。同时还帮助居民搬家，运煤，挑水。
    这个由家庭妇女和退休老工人等组成的服务站，是天津市街道居民办的最早的一个社会服务组织。它从开业以来，给附近工厂、机关、学校的职工和居民带来很多方便，受到人们的交口称赞。
        “第二总务科”
    每当铜丝铜网厂溶化粗丝工段的下班铃响过以后，就有一个青年妇女笑容满面地走进工厂。工人看到她，就亲切地说：“看！咱们的总务科长来了。”
    这个青年妇女就是服务站的拆洗缝补组的服务员，她的名字叫王蕙。服务站成立以后，就把溶化粗丝工段的缝洗工作服、手套、鞋罩、围裙等事务，全包揽起来。王蕙每天把工人们刚脱下来的工作服，拣在一起拿走；第二天上班以前，这些已经洗净的工作服便按号头挂在更衣室里了。当她知道工厂仓库里堆积了许多破手套、套袖、鞋罩以后，便主动把这些东西拿回去，突击洗净缝补好，使这些东西重新利用起来。有些手套破得实在没法补了，就拆成线让工厂用来擦机器。
    有一天，这个工厂使用的块煤快要烧完了，又找不出筛煤的人，眼看要影响生产。这时，工厂找到王蕙，请她帮助解决这个问题。第二天，拆洗缝补组就派去四个人筛煤，保证了生产需要。因此，工人们都亲切地称呼这个拆洗缝补组是“厂里的第二总务科”。
        待病人如亲人
    在第二中心医院的病房里住着一个病情严重的四岁的小孩。陪伴服侍这个小孩的青年妇女，每天给孩子喂五顿饭，试三次体温，喂三次药。每次喂药时，孩子总要哭一场，她总是耐心地哄着小孩把药吃下去。这个青年妇女还把小孩每天的大小便情况记载下来，主动把孩子的病情、饮食情况告诉大夫和护士。
    不知底细的人也许认为她是小孩的妈妈，其实她是服务站的服务员郝淑英，是临时来护理这个孩子的。
    像郝淑英这种无微不至地服侍病人的事例，在这个服务站里是很多的。综合制配厂的工人萧承彦夫妻两人都病了，吃饭、喝水都需要人照顾。服务站知道以后，马上派服务员去细心照顾他们。萧承彦住医院动手术时，服务员也跟着到医院服侍他。萧承彦夫妇的病就这样很快痊愈了。
        过路人的喜悦
    夜深了。一个中年男子来到大丰路服务站。这个人名叫罗静波，是刚从东北来天津，准备到济南探亲的。他带着小女儿来天津以后，到小孩的姨姨家看望了一下。那知小孩不愿走，姨姨决定留她住几天。罗静波便一人到济南去。但他走到街上才想起来没有给小孩留零用钱；如果赶回去送，又怕耽误了火车。他正在想办法的时候，走到了大伙巷街生活福利服务站附近。他想托服务站把钱送去，但又想：“服务站会管这些事吗？要不然，就向他们借点信纸信封，顺路到邮局把钱寄去吧。”
    罗静波走进服务站把来意说明以后，服务员说：“你不用邮寄了，交给我们替你送去好了。”罗静波刚走出门，服务员就紧跟着把钱给送去了。
