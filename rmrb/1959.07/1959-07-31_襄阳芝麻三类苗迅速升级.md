    Xiangyang Sesame Third-Class Seedlings Rapidly Upgrade
    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 30th dispatch) While doing a good job in grain and cotton production, Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, is vigorously grasping the field management of sesame.
    Sesame is a major crop in Xiangyang County, with a planting area of 325,000 mu. In order to achieve a bumper sesame harvest, the Xiangyang County Party Committee, from the county to the production team party organizations, has designated a Party Secretary or Party Committee member to be specifically responsible for sesame production. Production teams with larger sesame areas have allocated a certain amount of labor specifically responsible for sesame field management, and implemented a "four-package" responsibility system of contracted area, contracted investment, contracted yield, and contracted tasks, from planting to harvesting. In the "planting" and "management" process of sesame in Xiangyang County, whether in fertilization, weeding, pest control, or flood prevention, actions have been taken earlier than in previous years. At present, with the exception of a few late-season sesame crops, weeding has generally been done three times throughout the county, and some are rushing to weed the fourth time to conserve moisture for the sesame. Most of the sesame fields have been top-dressed once. The county originally discovered that about 20% of the seedlings were third-class, and now various places are supplementing them with quick-acting fertilizers to allow the third-class seedlings to eat their fill and gain strength to catch up with the first-class seedlings. The Xiji Production Team of the Zhupo Commune applied quick-acting fertilizers such as sesame cake, ammonium sulfate, fine cattle manure, and old wall soil to one hundred mu of late sesame land, and the sesame has turned from weak to strong, approaching the level of first-class seedlings.
    Recently, due to drought and no rain, pests such as soil locusts, aphids, and sesame insects have been discovered in some areas. Farmers are actively carrying out prevention and control activities. (Li Jinkai)

    襄阳芝麻三类苗迅速升级
    本报武汉30日电　湖北省襄阳县在搞好粮棉生产的同时，大抓芝麻的田间管理。
    芝麻是襄阳县的一种主要作物，播种面积达到三十二万五千亩。为了实现芝麻的大丰收，中共襄阳县委从县一直到生产队的党组织都指定一个党委书记或党委委员负责专管芝麻生产。芝麻面积较大的生产队，都抽出一定的劳力专门负责芝麻的田间管理，并且实行包面积，包投资、包产量、包任务，从种到收，一直到底的“四包”责任制。襄阳县的芝麻，在“种”和“管”的过程中，无论在施肥、锄草、除虫、防涝等各个环节，都比往年动手得早。目前全县除少数晚茬芝麻外，已普遍锄过三遍草，有的正在抢锄四道草，为芝麻保墒。大部分的芝麻地先后施过一道追肥。全县原来发现约有20％的三类苗，现各地正在补追速效肥料，让三类苗吃饱壮劲，赶上一类苗。朱坡公社新集生产队，把麻饼、硫酸铵、细牛栏粪、陈墙土等快速肥施到一百亩晚芝麻地里，芝麻已转瘦为壮，接近了一类苗。
    最近天旱无雨，有些地区已经发现土蝗虫、蚜虫、芝麻虫等虫害。农民们正在积极开展防治活动。　（李金锴）
