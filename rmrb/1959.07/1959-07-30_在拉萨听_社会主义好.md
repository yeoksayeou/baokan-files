Hearing "Socialism is Good" in Lhasa
Zhong Xin

It was evening when we arrived in Lhasa. We had just settled our luggage and sat down in our rooms when a Tibetan girl came in carrying a pot of water for washing and a thermos of hot water. The girl looked about sixteen or seventeen years old, slender, wearing a black long vest, with a belt around her waist, and two long braids trailing behind her. She placed the water pot beside the washbasin stand and gestured with her eyes for us to wash our faces. We nodded our thanks. A comrade casually asked her, "Can you speak Han Chinese?" She said shyly, "No." We said, "But that's Han Chinese you're speaking!" Everyone laughed. The girl was a little embarrassed by the laughter. She told us that she had only recently started working in the revolution, and used to be a slave in a noble's house. She only learned Han Chinese after she started working, and didn't know much of it.

The next morning, I had just woken up when I heard a female voice softly, faintly singing a song I knew well: "Socialism is Good." At first, I didn't pay much attention, thinking it was a female comrade from the interior singing. Soon, the singing stopped, and the door was gently pushed open. The Tibetan waitress brought in a pot of hot water for washing, then closed the door and went out. As soon as she left, the song continued. Ah, it was her singing, the Tibetan girl who not long ago was still a slave! I listened carefully, her voice filled with confidence, filled with strength, completely unlike her shy way of speaking Han Chinese. Although she hadn't learned much Han Chinese, she had already used the little she knew to sing the truth of our times. She sang each word, each syllable so accurately and clearly. She walked further away, her voice getting lower and lower, but I seemed to hear her continuing to sing, louder and louder. Girl, sing on, sing a socialist tomorrow for the plateau!

Not long after arriving in Lhasa, we encountered the traditional Saka Dawa festival. The Dragon King Pool Park behind the Potala Palace used to be a place where only nobles could set up tents, lay carpets, drink, gamble, and make merry. This year, it was very different. From morning to night, it was crowded with people. There were former serfs, "pariahs" in the eyes of the former nobles, as well as cadres working in government offices and students from schools. The residents' committees of several districts of Lhasa set up tents on the grass under the trees and held literary and artistic performances. The leather boats on the water were also full of tourists. Everywhere there were songs, musical instruments, and dance steps, sometimes fast, sometimes slow. At this time, the song "Socialism is Good" rang out from some corner, and then people in several other places began to sing it. Finally, I don't know when, the whole park reverberated with this song, singing it over and over again. At first, there were beginnings and endings, like a mixed chorus, but gradually it became completely unified, as if someone was conducting it. The people's voices were full of passion, full of joy. Several older people who couldn't sing were also stamping their feet, clapping their hands, and keeping time, as if singing along with their hearts. This was the most magnificent, majestic chorus I had ever heard. In this song, I seemed to see the dark, barbaric, backward old Tibet dying, and the bright, progressive, happy new Tibet being born. I myself unknowingly began to sing along.

Later, in manors, in temples, and on pastures, I heard this song many times. The Tibetan work team members of the Lhalu Manor in Donggar Zong were singing, the lamas of Drepung Monastery and the young lamas who were organized by the Rebellion Pacification Committee to study were also singing, the children near Dangba Village were also singing, and the herdsmen on the Damxung and Nagqu pastures were also singing. Some sang in Han Chinese lyrics, some sang in Tibetan lyrics. Every time I heard this song, I was very moved, as if it was the first time I had heard it.

    在拉萨听“社会主义好”
    钟辛
    我们到达拉萨的时候已是晚上。我们刚把行李安放好，在房间里坐定下来，就有个藏族的姑娘提着一壶洗脸水和一个开水瓶走进来。这个姑娘看去有十六、七岁，细长的身个，穿一身黑色的长坎肩，腰间扎着一根腰带，两条长辫子拖在背后。她把水壶放在脸盆架的旁边，用眼睛向我们示意，要我们过去洗脸。我们向她点头表示感谢。有个同志顺口问她：“你会说汉话吗？”她有些腼腆地说：“不会。”我们说：“你这说的不就是汉话吗？”这样，大家都笑起来了。那位姑娘被笑得有些不好意思。她告诉我们她参加革命工作不久，过去是一个贵族家的奴隶，参加工作以后才学汉话的，汉话会的不多。
    第二天清早，我刚刚醒来，就听到一个女声在轻轻地，若隐若现地唱着一支我熟悉的歌：“社会主义好”。起初我没有十分留意，以为是哪个从内地来的女同志在唱，不久，歌声停下来了，房门随着被轻轻地推开，那位藏族女招待员送进一壶洗脸的热水来，然后又带上门出去了，她一出去歌又重新继续唱下去了。啊，是她在唱，是这个不久前还是奴隶的藏族姑娘在唱！我仔细地倾听着，她的声音是那样地充满了自信，充满了力量，完全不像她讲汉话时那样羞涩。她虽然学会的汉话不多，但是她已经用这不多的汉话唱出了我们时代生活的真理。她把每个字、每个音节都唱得那么准确、清晰。她走远了，声音愈来愈低，但是我好像听到她一直唱下去，而且愈唱愈响。姑娘啊，唱吧，给高原唱出个社会主义的明天来！
    到拉萨没有多久，逢上了传统的萨卡达瓦节。布达拉宫后面的龙王塘林卡，往年是只有贵族才能去搭起帐篷、铺上地毯，喝酒赌钱，寻欢作乐的地方。今年，大不相同，这一天从早到晚都挤满了人。有过去的农奴，有过去贵族眼里的“贱民”，也有机关工作干部和学校的学生。拉萨市几个区的居民委员会在树林下面的草地上搭了帐篷，进行文艺表演。水上的牛皮船也载满了游人。到处是歌声、琴声、或紧或慢的舞步声。这时候不知从哪个角落里响起了“社会主义好”的歌声，接着另外几个地方也有人唱起了这个歌。最后，不知道从什么时候起，整个林卡里都响彻了这个歌声，唱了一遍又是一遍，开头还有前有后，像一个混声大合唱，渐渐就完全整齐一致了，好像有个人在那里指挥的一样。人们的声音里充满了激情，充满了快乐，有几个不会唱的老年人，也跺着脚、拍着手，打着拍子，好像用自己的心在跟着一起歌唱。这是我从来没有听到过的一次壮阔、雄伟的合唱。在这歌声里我好像看到黑暗的、野蛮的、落后的旧西藏正在死亡，光明的、进步的、幸福的新西藏正在诞生。我自己不知在什么时候也跟着唱了起来。
    以后，在庄园里，在寺庙里、在牧场上，又许多次地听到这支歌。东噶宗拉鲁庄园的藏族工作队员在唱，由平叛委员会组织起来在学习的哲蚌寺的喇嘛和幼年的小喇嘛也在唱，当巴村边的儿童也在唱，当雄和黑河牧场上的牧民也在唱，有的用汉文歌词唱，有的用藏文歌词唱。每一次听到这个歌我都十分感动，好像头一次听到一样。
