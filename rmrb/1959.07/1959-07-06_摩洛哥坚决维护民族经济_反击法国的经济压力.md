Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, July 4th. Moroccan Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Economy, Buabid, announced at a press conference today the economic decisions made at the special cabinet meeting held on the 3rd. The purpose of this decision is to cope with Morocco's economic situation after France unilaterally decided to stop "clearing accounts" and to avoid paralysis of Moroccan trade. According to this decision, the Moroccan government has taken the following measures: In terms of commerce, no restrictions will be imposed on the previous system. However, income from exports to countries in the Franc Zone, just like income from exports to countries outside the Franc Zone, should also be repatriated. For non-commercial settlements, all fund transfers must be approved by the Exchange Control Office.

Since Morocco decided to establish its own national bank, the "Bank of Morocco," France has been constantly exerting pressure on Morocco, attempting to obstruct Morocco from taking measures to develop its national economy. On the eve of the establishment of the "Bank of Morocco," France unilaterally decided to freeze Morocco's "clearing accounts" in the Franc Zone. "Clearing accounts" are a means for Morocco and other countries to conduct trade and financial ties.

    摩洛哥坚决维护民族经济
    反击法国的经济压力
    新华社拉巴特4日电　摩洛哥副首相、国民经济大臣布阿比德今天在记者招待会上宣布了3日举行的内阁特别会议作出的经济决定。这个决定的目的在于应付法国片面决定停止“来往账户”以后的摩洛哥的经济形势，并避免摩洛哥贸易瘫痪。根据这个决定，摩洛哥政府采取了如下的措施：在商业方面，对以前的制度不采取任何的限制。但是对法郎区国家出口的收入，正如对法郎区以外的国家出口的收入一样，也应该汇回国。对于非商业结账，一切资金转移必须要由汇兑局批准。
    自从摩洛哥决定成立自己的国家银行“摩洛哥银行”以来，法国就不断对摩洛哥施加压力，企图阻挠摩洛哥采取发展民族经济的措施。在“摩洛哥银行”成立的前夕，法国片面决定冻结摩洛哥在法郎区的“来往账户”。“来往账户”是摩洛哥和其他国家进行贸易和财政联系的一种手段。
