    Singing the Joy of the Ninth Symphony
    Li Ling
    Recently, China's music performance circles have presented two extremely significant world masterpieces: one is the cutting edge of modern symphonic music, Shostakovich's "Symphony No. 11 ('The Year 1905')" (performed by the Shanghai Orchestra and the Central Philharmonic Orchestra); the other is the pinnacle of classical music, Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9" (jointly performed by the Central Philharmonic Orchestra and the Central Broadcasting Orchestra Choir).
    Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony" is an ode to human freedom, equality, and sincere love. Beethoven's life was filled with the torment of poverty, the devastation of disease, and the suffering of Napoleon's betrayal of the French Revolution, as well as the calamities of the Franco-Prussian War. He detested the distinctions between wealth and poverty, loathed the hypocrisy of the aristocratic class, and abhorred wars of aggression. He longed for freedom and equality, for people to treat each other with genuine respect and love, regardless of background; the dream in his heart burned with a passion akin to Schiller's "Ode to Joy," and even more intensely. He sang of the joy that people had lost at the time. He fantasized: "Joy, thou beauteous godly lighting, daughter of Elysium, fire-inspired we are treading heaven's sanctuary! Thy enchantments bind together what custom strictly divided; all men shall be brothers."
  "When thy gentle wings hover, all mankind shall be as brothers." (Fourth movement of the Symphony, "Ode to Joy," lyrics by Schiller)
    He called on people to unite, to advance courageously, to enjoy the happiness of "joy." He used the poet's ode as the finale of the symphony, giving it full symphonic expression.
    Beethoven also knew that achieving joy was not easy. In the first movement of the symphony, the sounds of a giant relentlessly battling against the things he hated and abhorred constantly appeared. Romain Rolland called this symphony of joy "joy through suffering."
    Only after the emergence of Marx did people realize that it was impossible to achieve the desire for equality and fraternity in a class society. Therefore, the ambitions of Beethoven and Schiller for a "world of great harmony," for people to "respect and love each other," and for "joy and happiness" are naturally very precious.
    The symphony's conception is profound and great, and its structure is unprecedentedly large and complex.
    In his later years, Beethoven's writing style became more skilled and more subtle. Romain Rolland, in "Jean-Christophe," made this analogy for his style at this time: "The realm of his music became tranquil. His earlier works were like spring thunderstorms, gathering, erupting, and vanishing in the chest. His present works are like summer clouds, snow-capped peaks, a radiant roc soaring slowly, filling the sky."
    For a young Chinese symphony orchestra, performing this symphony is fraught with difficulties. There are countless important and subtle gaps in performing and singing techniques that need to be repaired and overcome. What is particularly difficult is to express Beethoven's unique magnificence, simplicity, clarity and vitality, the emotions of pain and joy, the sonorous and composed tone, and the broad and profound artistic conception. Adding the burden of technique makes it even more difficult to achieve a harmonious blend of heart and instrument.
    The performers, ambitious and working day and night, are doing everything in their power to embrace this valuable work, hoping to get as close as possible to the peak of world art—a place filled with "pain" and even more overflowing with "joy."

    歌唱欢乐的第九交响乐
    李凌
    我国音乐演奏界近来献演了两部极有意义的世界名作：一部是现代交响乐尖端，萧斯塔珂维奇的“第十一交响乐（“一九○五年”）（上海乐团、中央乐团演出）；另一部是古典音乐的高峰，贝多芬的“第九交响乐”（中央乐团和中央广播乐团合唱队联合演出）。
    贝多芬的“第九交响乐”是对人类自由平等、真诚相爱的颂歌。贝多芬的一生，历尽贫穷的折磨，疾病的摧残，也遭受过像拿破仑对法国革命的欺骗以及法普战争的灾难。他厌恶人间富贵贫贱的区分，厌恶贵族阶级那种假仁假义，更厌恶侵略战争。他渴望自由、平等，人类不分彼此，真心诚意地相敬相爱；他的心里燃烧起相近于席勒的“欢乐颂”中的梦想，而且比席勒来得更为炽热。他歌颂当时人们所失去的欢乐。他幻想：“欢乐的女神，你那美丽圣洁的灵光，普照大地，你的力量，能使人们消除一切分歧。”
  “只要你的温柔的翅膀张开，人们就会摒弃私见，相敬相爱，亲如兄弟。”（交响乐第四乐章“欢乐颂”，席勒词）
    他号召人们团结起来，勇敢前进，来亨受“欢乐”的幸福。他把诗人这首颂歌，作为交响乐的压轴曲，加以充分的交响化。
    贝多芬也知道，欢乐的获得不是那么容易。在交响乐的第一乐章，这种巨人一样的声音，反复地和他所厌恶、憎恨的东西进行的搏斗，就不断地出现。罗曼罗兰称这首欢乐的交响乐为“经过痛苦的欢乐”。
    从马克思出现以后，人们才晓得，在阶级社会里要实现平等博爱的愿望是不可能的。因此，贝多芬、席勒他们这种“世界大同”、愿人们“相敬相爱”、“欢乐幸福”的抱负，自然是非常可贵的。
    交响乐的构思的深远、伟大，结构的庞大、复杂是前所未有的。
    到了晚年，贝多芬的笔风更为熟练，更为含蓄。罗曼罗兰在“约翰·克利斯朵夫”一书中，对他这时期的作风做过这样的比拟：“他创作的音乐，境界变得恬静了。当年的作品像春天的雷雨，在胸中积聚，爆发，消灭的雷雨。现在的作品却像夏日的白云，积雪的山峰，通体放光的大鹏缓缓的翱翔，把天空填满了。”
    这首交响乐，年青的中国交响乐队演奏起来，困难重重，演唱演奏技术上有无数重要的以及细微的空隙要修补和克服；特别为难的是要表现出贝多芬所特有的雄浑、质朴、清明而充满活力，痛苦又欢乐的情感，响亮而沉着的情调，和宽阔而深刻的意境。加上技巧上的牵累，要使琴心交辉，就更难了。
    演员们雄心勃勃，夜以继日地竭尽一切力量来拥抱这部可贵的作品，希望尽可能接近这个世界艺术的峰顶——这里充满了“痛苦”，更洋溢着“欢乐”。
