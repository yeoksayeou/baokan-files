Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 22nd: American workers have launched a large-scale struggle to improve their living and working conditions since the beginning of this year, mounting a powerful counterattack against employers' offensives. The strike of 500,000 steelworkers, which began on July 15, has pushed this movement to a new climax, and the strike has now entered its second week.

Materials published by the U.S. Department of Labor in June indicate that the strike movement of American workers has risen sharply this year. In the first four months, there were 1,125 strikes, averaging almost ten strikes per day. 490,000 workers participated in these strikes or were affected by them. The number of workdays lost due to strikes reached seven million. In the same period last year, there were 954 strikes, with 375,000 participants, and only 3.33 million workdays lost. Since April, the American strike movement has continued to develop, with tens of thousands of rubber workers, hospital staff, seamen, barge workers, electrical workers, truck drivers, oil workers, and aircraft workers holding strikes. A mid-June issue of "U.S. News & World Report," in discussing the characteristics of these strikes, pointed out that many of the above-mentioned strikes have lasted a long time and the struggles have been very fierce. The magazine believes that this shows "a new and growing antagonism between employers and unions... It is more difficult to resolve strikes than before."

Among the surging strike movements, the recently started strike of 500,000 steelworkers is particularly noteworthy. This is not only because of the large number of participants and its significant impact (currently, American steel production has fallen to its lowest level since 1956 due to the strike), but also because both the union and large corporations regard this strike as the main battlefield for their power contest. Since the beginning of the strike, despite the capitalists' various attempts to crack down on the workers, and U.S. Secretary of Labor Mitchell's announcement on the 21st that he would conduct a so-called "investigation" of the strike, threatening to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act to undermine the strike, the steelworkers' morale remains high and they have received support from many other unions. The AFL-CIO, the United Auto Workers, the United Mine Workers of America, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union have all expressed support for the steelworkers. The United Steelworkers of America, which launched the strike, said, "We are ready for a long strike and will win this strike."

The high tide of workers' struggle for their immediate rights has caused great anxiety to the American ruling group. The U.S. Senate has passed a bill (the Kennedy-Ervin Act) by a vote of ninety to one, which aims to strengthen the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law and place unions under strict government control. This bill stipulates that the Secretary of Labor has the absolute power to force any union to submit detailed financial reports and other important union files to him, and has the right to hand over these documents to the capitalists. The Secretary of Labor also has the right to arbitrarily investigate all union records, prosecute unions and union officials, declare union constitutions illegal, and demand that courts declare union elections invalid, and have the government take over union elections...

John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, condemned the bill as an "iron band to be tied around the waists of sixteen million union members," which "is aimed at the poor with the support of the rich and powerful." The United Auto Workers, the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, the International Longshoremen's Association, and the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America also strongly opposed the bill. Even AFL-CIO President Meany, who had previously adopted a compromising attitude towards the bill, has recently had to change his attitude. He said, "The enemies of labor have acted, and we now have a bill (the Kennedy-Ervin Act) that we cannot cooperate with." Now the struggle against this bill, together with the great strike of American steelworkers, has become two major events in the current American workers' movement, and the broad masses of American workers are fighting for the victory of these two struggles.

    争取切身权利　反对反动法案
    美国工人运动走向新高潮
    五十万钢铁工人大罢工进入第二周
    新华社22日讯　纽约消息：美国工人今年以来展开了大规模的争取改善生活和劳动条件的斗争，对雇主的进攻进行了有力的反击。7月15日开始的五十万钢铁工人大罢工把这个运动推到新的高潮，这个罢工现在已经进入了第二周。
    美国劳工部6月间公布的材料表明，今年以来，美国工人的罢工运动大大高涨。头四个月，罢工达一千一百二十五次，平均差不多每天发生十次。参加这些罢工和受罢工影响的工人有四十九万人。因罢工而损失的工作日达七百万个。而在去年同一时期，罢工次数是九百五十四，参加罢工的人数是三十七万五千，因罢工而损失的工作日只有三百三十三万个。4月份以来，美国罢工运动继续发展，成千上万的橡胶工人、医院工作人员、海员、驳船夫、电气工人、货车司机、石油工人和飞机工人等纷纷举行罢工。6月中旬一期“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在谈到这些罢工的特点时指出，上述许多罢工都坚持得时间很长，斗争十分激烈。这家杂志认为，这说明“雇主和工会之间有着新的日益增长的对抗情绪……解决罢工比以前要困难了。”
    在风起云涌的罢工运动中，最近开始的五十万钢铁工人大罢工特别引人重视。这不但因为参加这次罢工的人数多，影响大（目前美国的钢铁生产已因罢工下降到1956年以来的最低水平），而且还由于工会和大公司之间都把这个罢工当作它们较量力量的主要战场。罢工开始以来，尽管资方在多方设法打击工人，美国劳工部长密契尔在21日也宣布他要对罢工进行所谓“调查”，威胁要援用塔夫脱—哈特莱法来破坏罢工，但是钢铁工人的斗志依旧昂扬，并且得到了其他许多工会的支持。“劳联—产联”，联合汽车工人工会，联合煤矿工人工会，国际汽车司机兄弟会以及国际码头与仓库工人工会等都声援钢铁工人。发动这个罢工的联合钢铁工人工会说：“我们已经准备好进行长期的罢工，并将赢得这次罢工。”
    工人争取切身权利斗争的高涨引起美国统治集团很大的不安。美国参议院已经以九十票对一票通过一项目的在于加强塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法，并把工会置于政府的严格控制下的法案（肯尼迪—欧文法案）。这个法案规定劳工部长有绝对的权力可以迫使任何一个工会向他提出详细的财政收支报告和工会其他重要档案，并有权把这些文件交给资方。劳工部长也有权随意调查所有工会的记录，对工会和工会干部进行起诉，宣布工会章程为非法，以及要求法院宣布工会的选举无效，并由政府包办工会选举……
    美国联合煤矿工人工会主席刘易斯谴责这个法案是一条要“缚在一千六百万工会会员腰身上的铁带”，它“在有钱有势的人的支持下是针对着穷人的”。联合汽车工人工会、国际开采、冶炼工人工会、美国码头工人联合会、联合电气、无线电和机器工人工会等也强烈反对这个法案。甚至原来对这个法案采取妥协态度的“劳联—产联”主席米尼最近也不得不改变态度。他说：“劳工的敌人已经行动起来了，我们现在已经有了一个法案（肯尼迪—欧文法案），这个法案是我们不能与之合作的”。现在反对这个法案的斗争同美国钢铁工人的大罢工已成了当前美国工人运动中的两件大事，美国广大工人群众正为争取这两个斗争的胜利而奋斗。
