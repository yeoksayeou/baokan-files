Mountain streams, if properly channeled, can irrigate flowers and fields, helping seedlings grow. Young people's extracurricular activities, if properly arranged, can benefit their minds and bodies, and inspire them to improve. Therefore, helping young people arrange their extracurricular activities well should be an important task for the grassroots organizations of the Communist Youth League.

Why is it particularly emphasized to help young people arrange their extracurricular activities? Because young people are generally not good at arranging their own lives, and they often have the feeling and distress of "having leaders at work, but no one to care for them after work." The young workers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory do not have this feeling and distress. Look at their extracurricular life, how fulfilling, happy and civilized it is!

"The tree of life is evergreen," and the life of young people is even more deeply rooted and flourishing, developing vigorously in all directions. Therefore, when the grassroots organizations of the League help young people arrange their extracurricular activities, they must see this characteristic, adapt to people, times and circumstances, take care of their different hobbies and interests, and be good at following the nature of water, like diverting water to irrigate fields, to help young people continue to move forward.

### 当好生活的向导

    当好生活的向导
    山间溪水，如疏导得当，可以浇花灌田，助苗发育。青年的业余活动，如妥善安排，就能有益身心，催人向上。因此，帮助青年安排好业余生活，应当是共青团基层组织的一项重要任务。
    为什么要特别强调帮助青年安排业余生活呢？因为青年一般不善于安排自己的生活，他们往往有“上班有领导，下班无人管”的感觉和苦闷。上海机床厂的青工们，却没有这种感觉和苦闷。你看他们的业余生活，过得多么美满、快乐和文明啊！
    “生活之树是常青的”，而青年的生活，更是根深叶正茂，正向四方蓬勃发展。所以团的基层组织，在帮助青年安排业余生活的时候，一定要看到这个特点，要因人因时因事制宜，照顾他们的不同爱好和兴趣，要像引水灌田一样，善于顺着水性，帮助青年不断前进。
