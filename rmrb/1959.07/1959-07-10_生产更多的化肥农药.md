A large amount of potash fertilizer from the Qinghai Charkhan Potash Fertilizer Plant is being shipped out; three fertilizer plants in Anqing Prefecture, Anhui Province, have been put into production; the output of pesticide 666 from Guangdong Yuanyulong Chemical Plant increased by 29.2% in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, and will increase by another 26% in the third quarter compared with the second quarter... Good news about industry vigorously supporting agriculture is coming in continuously. The large-scale production and commissioning of these factory products has contributed to this year's agricultural harvest and provided a guarantee.

The city supports agricultural production with industrial products, and the countryside supports industrial production with agricultural and sideline products, promoting each other and developing together. This is a new type of urban-rural relationship in socialism. Without the support of agriculture, industrial production will not be able to obtain sufficient raw materials; similarly, without the support of industry, there will be no definite guarantee for increased agricultural production.

In order to promote this year's agricultural harvest, in what aspects should industry provide support at present? According to the season and agricultural production, the most needed items at present are chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

Fertilizer is one of the basic guarantees for increased agricultural production. At present, the summer harvest has passed, and autumn crops are in need of topdressing fertilizer to promote growth. Chemical fertilizer is small in size, convenient to transport, and especially effective and fast-acting, making it an ideal fertilizer for topdressing. Therefore, we must seize the opportunity to vigorously increase the production of chemical fertilizer to meet the needs of agricultural production.

Pesticides are the "guards" of agricultural production increase. One of the basic experiences of agricultural increase over the years is that agricultural harvests have been achieved by overcoming pests and diseases. This year, drought and flood are unevenly distributed in some areas. Especially in these areas, the increase in autumn crop pests and diseases may occur, and some places have already discovered it. Although some places have not experienced pests and diseases now, we must not be negligent and should make full preparations. Therefore, it is necessary to greatly increase the production of pesticides.

Increasing the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides must emphasize both quantity and quality. Chemical fertilizers of poor quality cannot achieve the effect of increasing production, and will cause waste of manpower and materials. Poor quality pesticides will delay the timing of prevention and control, expand the scope of pests and diseases, and cause irreparable losses. The production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides must be both large in quantity and good in quality.

The main method of increasing the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides is to tap the potential of existing equipment. As long as we carry out technological innovation and strengthen equipment maintenance, we can rapidly increase the output and quality of products without increasing or with little increase in equipment. The Guangzhou Pesticide Plant produces pesticide copper sulfate. By improving the equipment and operating methods of the dissolution reaction process, the output has increased by 40%, and the quality has also been significantly improved, which is a clear example. As for raw materials, we should expand the source of raw materials, reduce the consumption of raw materials, strengthen the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and find suitable substitutes. In short, we must do everything possible to increase the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. As long as we fully mobilize the masses, many difficulties can be overcome.

Increasing the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to support agricultural production is not only a matter for large cities and large factories. Small towns and industries run by communes, wherever conditions permit, should also strive to increase the production of qualified local chemical fertilizers and local pesticides during this period.

Chemical plants and pesticide plants, mobilize and step up production, and strive to make great contributions in supporting this year's great agricultural harvest!

### 生产更多的化肥农药

    生产更多的化肥农药
    青海察尔汉钾肥厂大批钾肥源源出厂；安徽省安庆专区三个化肥厂投入生产；广东源裕隆化工厂第二季度农药六六六产量比第一季度增长29.2％，第三季度比第二季度将再增产26％……工业大力支援农业的好消息源源而来，这些工厂产品大批出厂和投入生产，为今年的农业丰收付出了一分力量，提供了一份保证。
    城市以工业产品支援农业生产，农村以农副产品支援工业生产，互相促进，共同发展，这是社会主义的新型城乡关系。离开了农业的支援，工业生产将得不到足够的原料材料；同样，离开了工业的支援，农业的增产也就没有确切的保障。
    为了促进今年的农业丰收，目前工业应当从哪些方面加以支援？按照季节和农业生产的情况，当前最需要的是化学肥料和农药。
    肥料，是农业增产基本保证之一。当前，夏收已过，秋作物正是需要追施肥料、促进生长的时候。化肥体积小，运输方便，特别是肥效大，见效快，是施加追肥的理想肥料。因此，必须抓紧时机，大力增产化肥，适应农业生产的需要。
    农药是农业增产的“卫兵”。历年农业增产的基本经验之一，就是战胜了病虫害而获得了农业的丰收。今年，若干地区旱涝不均。特别是在这些地方，秋禾病虫害增加的情况可能发生，而且有的地方已经发现。有些地方虽然现在没有发生病虫害，但是我们决不能麻痹大意，应当作充分准备。因此，必须大量增产农药。
    增产化肥和农药，必须产量质量并重。质量差的化肥，不能起到增加生产的效果，而且会造成人力、物力的浪费。质量差的农药，更会贻误防治时机，扩大病虫害范围，造成不可弥补的损失。化肥和农药的生产，必须是又多又好。
    增产化肥、农药，主要的方法是挖掘现有设备潜力。只要开展技术革新，加强设备维修，就能够在不增加或少增加设备的条件下，迅速提高产品的产量和质量。广州农药厂生产农药硫酸铜，由于改进了溶解反应工序的设备和操作方法，产量增加了40％，质量也有显著提高，就是一个明显的例子。至于原料，应当扩大原料来源，降低原料消耗，加强原料的综合利用，寻找适当的代用品。总之，必须千方百计提高化肥和农药的生产，只要充分发动群众，许多困难就能够克服。
    增产化肥和农药支援农业生产，不仅是大城市、大工厂的事情，小城镇以及公社办的工业，凡是有条件的，也应该在这一时期努力增产合乎质量要求的土化肥和土农药。
    化工厂、农药厂、动员起来，加紧生产，争取在支援今年农业大丰收中立大功！
