　　Good Forms of Amateur Education
　　The Jiangbei Machinery Factory in Jilin training veteran cadres and veteran workers, and the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company training apprentices, are both good methods for industrial and mining enterprises to cultivate talent.
　　Whether it is coal, machinery, or steel, as well as other light industrial products, their quantity and quality are inseparable from the political, cultural, and technical levels of the workers in the factories and mines that produce them. A factory or mine cannot rely on only one method to improve the political, cultural, and technical levels of its employees. Factory and mine production procedures are interconnected, and each link is tightly connected. Workers in various trades must constantly improve their education, absorb new knowledge, and the cadres in charge of each department must also improve. Our factories and mines are constantly developing, new factories and mines are put into production, and a large number of apprentices have emerged. These apprentices must also grow up quickly. Therefore, factories and mines need to cultivate all kinds of talents. Only in this way can we adapt to new requirements.
　　The value of the Jiangbei Machinery Factory and Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's practices lies in the fact that they organize them to study using new forms of amateur education, according to the characteristics of cadres, veteran workers, and apprentices, and according to the needs of production development. In this way, they constantly cultivate talent in the process of developing production, and constantly develop production in the process of cultivating talent.

    业余教育的好形式
    吉林江北机械厂培养老干部、老工人和武汉钢铁公司培养徒工，都是工矿企业培养人材的好办法。
    不论是煤炭、机器，或是钢铁，以及其他轻工业产品，它们的量多量少、质优质劣，都是同生产这种产品的厂矿的职工政治、文化和技术水平分不开的。一个工厂或矿山，要提高职工政治文化和技术水平，只靠一种办法是不行的。厂矿生产程序是互相衔接的，各个环节扣得很紧。各种工种的工人都要不断提高文化，吸取新的知识，掌握各个部门的干部，也要提高。我们厂矿不断发展，新的厂矿投入生产，出现了大批徒工，这些徒工，也要很快成长起来。因此，厂矿需要培养各种各样的人材。这样，才能适应新的要求。
    江北机械厂和武汉钢铁公司做法的可贵之处，就是因为他们根据干部、老工人和徒工的特点，按着生产发展的需要，用新的业余教育的形式，组织他们学习。这样，就在发展生产的过程中不断培养了人材，在培养人材的过程中不断发展了生产。
