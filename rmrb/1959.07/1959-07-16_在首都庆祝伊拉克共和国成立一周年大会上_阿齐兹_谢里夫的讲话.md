Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: The following is the full text of the speech by Aziz Sharif, Special Representative of the Republic of Iraq, at the celebration of the first anniversary of the birth of the Republic of Iraq held by people from all walks of life in the capital:

Dear friends:

From Baghdad, the city of peace, from the birthplace of the free and democratic Republic of Iraq, from Iraq, the site of the glorious July Revolution, I bring to the representatives of the great Chinese people, the loyal sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the warmest and most sincere respect and deep gratitude from the creators of the July Revolution and the loyal son of the Iraqi people, the heroic revolutionary leader, Abdul Karim Kassem. I also extend, through you, to the great Chinese people and your wise and beloved leader Mao Zedong, to Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and to all the other people's leaders—under whose leadership the Chinese people have achieved victory and prosperity—the warmest respect from our people and the leader of our national democratic revolution.

Dear friends: You are here celebrating the first anniversary of the July Revolution, celebrating the birth of the Republic of Iraq. As we Iraqis celebrate this very dear anniversary, we should also celebrate the unity between the great Chinese people and us, and the decisive support that the Chinese people have given to our newborn republic. The Chinese people, along with other peaceful forces, defended our republic like a lion defending its endangered cubs.

During those extremely terrifying and dark days under the oppression of imperialism and the reactionary ruling groups who only obeyed the dictates of imperialism, our people watched the news of your struggles, the founding of your republic, and all your great achievements with boundless love and sympathy. Our people regarded China as a beacon, and although the conditions in our two countries are different, we learned from the light of the beacon how to fight against imperialism, feudalism, and other domestic reactionary forces.

The revolution of July 1958 has paved the way for the truly intimate and seamless unity between our two peoples. You issued a warning to the forces of aggression: they must not extend their claws into the Republic of Iraq. Our people will never forget this glorious stance. More than 300 million of you participated in demonstrations in major cities, shouting slogans to the imperialists: "Oppose aggression against the Republic of Iraq!" Since then, our two republics have taken a major step forward on the road of fraternal unity and cooperation—a journey worthy of praise.

After our two countries recognized each other and reached an agreement to exchange ambassadors, we concluded two agreements on cultural cooperation and economic exchange. People's delegations visited each other, and the Iraq-China Friendship Association and the China-Iraq Friendship Association were established one after another.

Indeed, the friendship of the great Chinese people is our people's greatest reliance, and we rely on its support to build and develop a new society. The experience of the Chinese people is our invaluable reference.

The road to achieving broader cooperation in all aspects is open to us, because this is the wish of our two peoples. Achieving this cooperation is in the interests of both peoples and in the interests of the cause of freedom and peace for all peoples.

Your republic is striving for cooperation with all peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples, and our republic is doing the same.

Furthermore, our young republic was born in the struggle for unity with the people of our Arab sister nations, and it is being consolidated and growing in the struggle for unity with the people of our Arab sister nations and the people of friendly countries.

To support Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, we have taken action many times. In the past, our army had received orders to interfere with the fraternal people of Lebanon, but the revolution of July 14th united us with the people of Lebanon and disrupted the imperialist intervention plan.

If the survival of our republic is due to the unity of our people, it is also due to the support of the fraternal Arab people and the support of other peaceful and friendly people in the world, such as the people of India, the people of Indonesia, and especially the support of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Bulgaria, and other socialist countries and people.

We follow the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the principles of the Bandung Conference, and the principles of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo. We participated in these conferences before our revolution's victory.

The leader of our revolution, Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kassem, has expressed our desire to unite with brothers and friends. He said: "We want to unite and cooperate with all countries on the basis of mutual benefit; we want to unite with the Arab people and support them without compensation."

Friends: Our people have learned many things from the struggles of all peoples, and now still urgently need to use the experiences of all peoples as their guide. In the past year, our people have achieved historical achievements worthy of learning from. There is no doubt that these achievements are inseparable from the struggles of all peoples, which created historical conditions for these achievements.

Like elsewhere in the world, the chains of imperialism in the Far East have been shattered by your great and victorious revolution.

The unity, awareness, and leadership of our people have also made historical contributions to the cause of liberation of all peoples.

The surging revolutionary tide has arrived, and therefore our task has become easier.

Under the leadership of Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kassem, our people have smashed the largest stronghold of imperialism in the Middle East. At dawn on July 14th, a clever strike accomplished a great deal, and forty years of arduous and brutal struggle came to an end. After July 14th, Baghdad, Iraq, leaped from being a stronghold of imperialism and the center of the Baghdad Pact, from a base for plotting aggression against the Arab people and the people of the Middle East, from a military base for imperialism to prepare for world war, to becoming a peaceful country, a paradise of democracy and freedom. After this clever strike, our people achieved significant successes in striving for complete independence, seeking economic, financial, and trade liberation, and in the economic development of society.

Iraq has broken free from the Baghdad Pact, thus breaking the chain of the imperialist military structure from the western Atlantic, through Eurasia, to the eastern Pacific. The military treaties imposed on our people by the imperialist military institutions have been abolished. For example, the bilateral military agreement and its secret annex imposed on our country for the benefit of British imperialism, as well as the Eisenhower Doctrine and the common military assistance treaty imposed on us for the benefit of American imperialism.

We have liberated our army from the control of American and British military advisory groups, and we have strengthened our army by expanding a new division with modern weapons.

We have liberated our bases from foreign control and ensured that the last foreign soldier withdraws from our country.

We have concluded a number of trade agreements with many countries, so that our trade has been freed from the control of imperialist monopoly groups imposed on us, which favored imperialism.

We have formulated our own trade policy, which is based on mutual benefit and ensuring our economic development.

In order to achieve economic development, we have concluded an economic and technical assistance agreement with the Soviet Union. We have concluded some agreements with many other countries for the construction of industry.

We have formulated and implemented the land reform law, eradicated feudal remnants, and distributed land to farmers.

The power of the people, the democratic forces of the people, have been liberated, grown, and consolidated. Our country has several democratic groups, which are composed of various strata and industries in society: workers, farmers, business owners, merchants, students, democratic youth, women, teachers, engineers, journalists, etc. The peace movement has been consolidated and developed, and today it is supported by millions of people.

Our revolution is moving forward bravely. Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kassem once said: We should have one or two revolutions every month.

Despite the fact that our republic has been busy defending our threatened homeland since the day it was born, all the things mentioned above have been accomplished.

From the beginning, we faced serious conspiracies by American and British imperialist military institutions to openly invade our republic. Later, we faced many conspiracies that wanted to shatter our republic from within, and these conspiracies were precisely for the benefit of foreign interventionists.

We have faced and are still facing major conspiracies: military actions, the conclusion of military treaties, in order to surround us militarily; to isolate us economically and politically.

So how were our achievements realized? This is a miracle, the result of the unity of the revolutionary people, the result of the unity of national forces, the result of the unity of the army, the people, and the army leadership. Unity, unity, and more unity. This is a best lesson for the people of a small country in fighting against enemies that outnumber and out-equip them by hundreds of times (if we don't say thousands of times) and in completing their historical tasks.

But unity has content. So what is the content of people's unity? The people are united on the basis of a national democratic revolution. The national forces of our people have been united, and the people and the people's government that launched the revolution are united under this revolutionary content.

The content of our revolution is not a program plan written by an empty philosopher, nor is it a program plan written by a group of political careerists who are divorced from the people. It was written by martyrs with the blood that irrigated the land of our beloved motherland, it was written with the blood of our soldiers, it was written with the tears of mothers who lost their sons, it was written with the tears of widows and orphans.

Our revolution is not a socialist revolution, but this does not harm us, because the development of our history does not yet require such a revolution. It is only a national democratic revolution, an unadulterated national democratic revolution.

This revolution is the result of a long-term struggle. The objective conditions in the world and locally have matured to get rid of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal situation in our country, which was ruled by a group of extremely decadent people. History has left this system behind, and this group of people, who used the most brutal, barbaric, and rogue methods to maintain their own interests and the interests of imperialist feudal elements, should also decay and disintegrate.

Therefore, the most urgent wish is to eliminate imperialism and its lackeys, to eliminate feudalism, and our most urgent wish is to realize individual and national democratic freedom with our blood and our heart's blood.

In this way, our people realize that this historical transformation is inevitable. Repeated uprisings, repeated bloody and peaceful bold attempts, reflect this historical transformation. Therefore, the inevitability of this historical transformation is the true content of the unity of our national forces, and it is also the true content of the unity between our people and the nationalist government that emerged from the revolution.

Before July 14th, the program of the national front, the announcements of various democratic parties, and the revolutionary announcement on the morning of July 14th, all truly elucidated the inevitability of historical transformation, the inevitability of eliminating imperialism and feudalism, and the inevitability of realizing democracy and freedom.

Because of this, we are united and continue to complete this historical task, defending the republic and its democratic and patriotic measures, which is the content of our unity.

With this unity, our republic has crossed a year full of storms, a year full of open and hidden conspiracies of aggression. However, our people today face conspiracies and tricks that are more serious and despicable than these open and hidden conspiracies of aggression. This is the attempt to divide our national forces, to divide the unity between the people and the leaders, to divert the democratic tendency of our republic, and thus steal the fruits of the national democratic revolution of our republic. Thus, only an empty shell remains in the elements of life. From this we believe that the result of the struggle of our people to maintain the unity of the people, the unity of democratic forces, and the unity between the people and the national leadership will have a decisive impact on the struggle for freedom in all Arab countries and the entire Middle East. Because the history of the liberation of the Arab East has given our people and their national leadership a very glorious task, that is, to stand at the forefront of the struggle for freedom that is taking place in this region. We believe that our people and their patriotic leadership will sincerely and gloriously shoulder his responsibilities.

We know that the fraternal Arab people and other friendly people are today placing infinite sympathy on us, looking forward to our struggle to strive for unity and to defend the full content of our democratic republican system.

Despite the many complex problems we face, our greatest hope is that, as in our many past situations, victory still belongs to us. As long as our task is in line with the course of history, then it is easy to achieve.

As for those who previously stood against the direction of history, we pity them, because they wasted their strength in vain on things that were impossible to do.

Long live the unity of the Iraqi people and their patriotic forces with their loyal leadership in order to safeguard the republic's national democratic system!

Long live the fraternal close unity between the Iraqi people and the great Chinese people!

Long live China-Arab unity!

Long live the unity of the Asian and African people!

Long live the unity of all peoples fighting for peace, liberation, and democracy!

World peace forever!

    在首都庆祝伊拉克共和国成立一周年大会上
    阿齐兹·谢里夫的讲话
    新华社15日讯　伊拉克共和国特别代表阿齐兹·谢里夫在首都各界人民庆祝伊拉克共和国诞生一周年大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    从和平之家巴格达，从自由民主的伊拉克共和国的诞生地，从光荣的七月革命所在地伊拉克，我给伟大的中国人民的代表们，中国人民忠诚的儿女们，带来了伊拉克人民七月革命的缔造者和伊拉克人民忠实的儿子、英勇的革命领袖阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·卡塞姆的最热烈的诚挚的敬意和深切的感谢。我还通过你们向伟大的中国人民和你们的英明的敬爱的领袖毛泽东，向刘少奇主席，向其他各位人民领袖们——中国人民在他们的领导下取得了胜利和昌盛——转达我国人民和我们民族民主革命领袖的最热烈的敬意。
    亲爱的朋友们：你们在这里庆祝七月革命一周年纪念，庆祝伊拉克共和国的诞生。我们伊拉克人在庆祝这个使人感到非常亲切的纪念日的时候，也应该庆祝伟大的中国人民和我们之间的团结，庆祝中国人民给我们新生的共和国的决定性的支持。中国人民同其他和平力量一道，像狮子捍卫他的面临危险的幼儿一样来保卫我们的共和国。
    在帝国主义和唯帝国主义之命是听的反动统治集团的压迫下，在那些极端恐怖黑暗的日子里，我国人民怀着无限热爱和同情的心情，注视着你们斗争的消息，注视着你们共和国的成立和你们的一切巨大的成就。我国人民把中国当作一座灯塔，虽然我们两国的条件不同，但借着灯塔的光芒，我们知道了对帝国主义、封建主义和国内的其他反动势力应该怎样进行斗争。
    1958年7月的革命已经为我们两国人民真正的亲密无间的团结开辟了道路。你们向侵略势力发出了警告：不得把魔爪伸入伊拉克共和国。我国人民永远不会忘记这种光辉的立场。你们在各大城市里有三亿多人参加了示威游行，并向帝国主义者高呼口号：“反对侵略伊拉克共和国！”从那时候起，我们两个共和国在兄弟般的团结、合作的大道上向前迈进了一大步——这是一段值得歌颂的路程。
    我们两国相互承认，并达成互派大使的协议之后，又缔结了文化合作和经济交流两个协定，人民的代表团相互进行了访问，伊中友好协会和中伊友好协会相继成立。
    的确，伟大的中国人民的友谊是我国人民的最大依靠，我们建设和发展新社会就依靠它的支援。中国人民的经验就是我们无可估价的借鉴。
    在各方面实现更广泛的合作的道路向我们敞开着，因为这是我们两国人民的愿望。实现这种合作既符合两国人民的利益，也符合各国人民的自由与和平事业的利益。
    你们共和国正在争取与爱好和平、自由的各国人民进行合作，我们共和国也正在这样做。
    再说，我们年轻的共和国就是在和阿拉伯姊妹国家的人民团结一致的斗争中诞生的，是在和阿拉伯姊妹国家的人民以及友好国家的人民团结一致的斗争中巩固和成长起来的。
    为了支持埃及、叙利亚和巴勒斯坦，我们曾经多次行动起来。过去，我们的军队曾经接到命令要它对兄弟般的黎巴嫩人民进行干涉，但是，7月14日的革命却使我们和黎巴嫩人民团结在一起，打乱了帝国主义的干涉计划。
    如果说，我们共和国的生存是由于我们人民的团结，那么，同时它的生存还由于有兄弟的阿拉伯人民的支持，以及世界其他爱好和平的友好的人民的支持，如像印度人民，印度尼西亚人民的支持，特别是有苏联、中华人民共和国、保加利亚和其他社会主义国家和人民的支持。
    我们遵行和平共处的五项原则、万隆会议和在开罗召开的亚非人民团结大会的各项原则。在我们革命胜利之前，我们就参加了这些会议。
    我们革命的领袖阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·卡塞姆已经表达了我们的愿望：同兄弟和朋友们团结一致。他说：“我们要在互利的基础上和所有的国家团结起来，并且和它们进行合作；我们要和阿拉伯各国人民团结起来，并无偿地支援他们。”
    朋友们：我国人民从各国人民的斗争中学到了许多东西，而现在仍然迫切需要以各国人民的经验作为自己的指南。在过去一年内，我国人民已经取得了可资借鉴的历史性的成绩。毫无疑问，这些成绩的取得是与各国人民的斗争分不开的，这些斗争给这些成绩的取得创造了具有历史性的条件。
    像在世界其他地方一样，帝国主义在远东的锁链已被你们伟大而胜利的革命所粉碎。
    我国人民的团结、觉悟和领导才能，也曾为各国人民的解放事业做出了历史性的贡献。
    澎湃的革命高潮已经来到，因此我们的任务也就变得更容易。
    我国人民在领袖阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·卡塞姆总理的领导下，粉碎了帝国主义在中近东的最大的堡垒。在7月14日的黎明，只是很巧妙的一击，就大事告成，四十年来的艰苦而残酷的斗争就这样结束了。7月14日以后，巴格达、伊拉克从帝国主义的堡垒和巴格达条约的中心，从阴谋侵略阿拉伯人民以及中东人民的基地，从帝国主义准备世界大战的军事基地，一跃而成为和平的国家，变成了民主自由的乐土。在这次的巧妙的打击之后，我国人民在争取完全的独立，在求得经济、财政、贸易的解放，以及在社会的经济的发展方面，获得了重大的成就。
    伊拉克已经摆脱了巴格达条约，这样就把帝国主义军事机构从大西洋西部经过欧亚到太平洋东部的军事包围圈的锁链打断了。帝国主义军事机构强加在我国人民头上的军事条约已被废除。譬如为了英帝国主义的利益强加在我国头上的双边军事协定和这一协定的秘密副件，又如艾森豪威尔主义以及为了美帝国主义的利益强加在我们头上的共同军事援助条约。
    我们把我们的军队从美英军事顾问团的控制下解放了出来，我们以新式的武器扩建了一个新的师来加强我们的军队。
    我们把我们的基地从外国的控制下解放出来，并使最后的一个外国兵撤离我们的国家。
    我们同许多国家缔结了一些贸易协定，使得我们的贸易从强加在我们头上而有利于帝国主义的大垄断集团的控制下解放出来。
    我们制订了自己的贸易政策，这种政策是以互利和保证我们的经济发展为基础的。
    为了实现经济发展，我们同苏联缔结了经济技术援助协定。为了建设工业，我们同其他许多国家缔结了一些协定。
    我们制定并实行了土地改革法，肃清封建残余，把土地分配给农民。
    人民的力量，人民的民主力量已经解放、成长并得到了巩固。我国有几个民主团体，这些团体是由社会上各个不同阶层和行业组成的：有工人、农民、企业主、商人、学生、民主青年、妇女、教师、工程师、新闻记者等等……。和平运动巩固和发展了，今天，它得到了成百万人的支持。
    我们的革命在勇往直前，领袖阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·卡塞姆总理曾经这样说过：我们每月都应该有一个革命，或者两个革命。
    尽管我们的共和国在诞生的第一天起就忙于保卫我们被威胁的国土，但是，以上所提到的这一切事情都完成了。
    我们一开始就面临着美英帝国主义军事机构公开侵略我们共和国的严重的阴谋。以后，我们又面临着想从内部粉碎我们共和国的许许多多的阴谋，这些阴谋正是为了外国干涉者的利益。
    我们曾经面临着现在仍然面临着重大的阴谋：军事行动、缔结军事条约，以便从军事方面包围我们；从经济、政治方面孤立我们。
    那么，我们的那些成就怎样才实现的呢？这是一个奇迹，是革命人民团结的结果，是民族力量团结的结果，是军队、人民和军队领导团结的结果。团结、团结再团结。这是一个小国人民在反对在数量和装备上超过它们几百倍的敌人（如果我们不说是几千倍的话）和完成他们历史任务的斗争中一个最好的教训。
    但是，团结是有内容的。那么，人民团结的内容是什么呢？人民是在民族的民主的革命的基础上团结起来的。我国人民民族力量已经团结起来了，人民和发动革命的人民政府都在这个革命内容下团结起来。
    我们革命的内容不是一个空的哲学家所写下的纲领计划，也不是那群脱离人民的政治野心家笔下的纲领计划。它是烈士们用灌溉了我们可爱的祖国的土地的鲜血写成的，是用我们战士们的心血写成的，是用失去了儿子的母亲的眼泪写成的，是用寡妇、孤儿的眼泪写成的。
    我们的革命不是社会主义的革命，但是这对我们并没有害处，因为我们历史的发展还不需要进行像这样的革命。它只是民族民主革命，是不折不扣的民族民主革命。
    这次革命是长期的斗争的结果。世界的、地方的客观条件已经成熟，来摆脱我国这一为一群腐朽透顶的人们所统治的半殖民半封建的情况。历史已经把这种制度抛到脑后了，这群人利用了最残酷野蛮无赖的手段来维护他们自己和帝国主义封建分子的利益，他们也该腐朽解体了。
    因此，最迫切的愿望是消灭帝国主义及其走狗，消灭封建主义，我们最迫切的愿望是用我们的鲜血、我们的心血来实现个人的和全民的民主自由。
    这样，我国人民意识到这一历史的转变是必然的。多次的起义，多次的流血的和和平的大胆尝试，反映了这一历史的转变。因此这种历史转变的必然性就是我们民族力量的团结的真实内容，也是我国人民和从革命中产生的民族主义政府团结的真实内容。
    7月14日前，民族阵线的纲领、各民主党派的公告以及7月14日晨的革命公告，都真实地阐明了历史转变的必然性，消灭帝国主义、封建主义和实现民主与自由的必然性。
    由于这样，我们团结一致，继续完成这个历史性的任务，保卫共和国及其民主、爱国措施，这一切是我们团结的内容。
    有了这种团结，我们共和国跨越了充满着风暴的一年，跨越了充满着公开的、隐蔽的侵略阴谋的一年。然而，我们的人民今天面临着比这些公开的、隐蔽的侵略阴谋更严重更卑鄙的阴谋诡计。这就是企图分化我们的民族力量，分裂人民与领导者之间的团结一致，转移我们共和国的民主倾向，从而窃取我们共和国的民族民主革命的成果。这样在生活的要素中只剩下空空洞洞的外壳。由此我们认为：我国人民为维护人民的团结、民主力量的团结以及人民与民族的领导之间的团结而进行斗争的结果，将对所有阿拉伯国家和整个中东进行自由的斗争产生决定性的影响。因为阿拉伯东方解放的历史，已经给予我国人民及其民族的领导一个十分光荣的任务，这就是站在这个地区正进行着的自由斗争的最前列。我们认为我国人民及其爱国的领导将真诚地、荣耀地担负起他的职责。
    我们知道兄弟的阿拉伯人民和其他友好的人民今天正对我们寄予无限同情，展望着我们为争取团结和保卫我们民主共和制度的全部内容所作的斗争。
    尽管我们面临着许多复杂的问题，我们最大的希望就是正如我们过去的许多次情况一样，胜利仍然是属于我们的。只要我们的任务符合历史的进程，那么它是容易实现的。
    至于那些以前曾站在与历史的方向相反的人，我们可怜他们，因为他们曾把他们的力量徒劳无益地花在不可能做到的事情上。
    为了维护共和国民族民主的制度，伊拉克人民及其爱国力量与忠诚的领导团结万岁！
    伊拉克人民与伟大的中国人民的兄弟般的紧密团结万岁！
    中国阿拉伯团结万岁！
    亚非人民团结万岁！
    为争取和平、解放、民主的各国人民团结万岁！
    全世界永久和平！
