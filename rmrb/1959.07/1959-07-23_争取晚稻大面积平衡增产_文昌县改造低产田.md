Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 22nd. After summarizing the experiences of high-yield late rice last year and early rice this year, Wenchang County, Hainan Island, launched a massive movement to transform low-yield fields in this year's late rice production. Currently, in addition to 12,000 people specializing in managing high-yield fields, 18,000 people are working in 987 low-yield plots, with 70% of the labor force specifically managing remote low-yield fields. Each commune has established a headquarters or committee for transforming low-yield fields, and each production brigade has also established a research group to strengthen technical guidance for transforming low-yield fields.

When Wenchang County seriously summarized the experiences and lessons learned from last year's late rice and this year's early rice production, it discovered that communes and production teams with significant yield increases generally focused on transforming backward areas and eliminating low-yield fields. For example, Changsa Commune implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in large areas of early rice fields this year, increasing yields by more than 60%; while the neighboring Wenchang Education Commune only focused on high-yield plots and neglected the transformation of low-yield plots. Therefore, although many high-yield fields emerged, the total output increase was still not significant.

Wenchang County proposed four measures for transforming low-yield fields: Effectively strengthen specific leadership to create experience in transforming low-yield to high-yield, and promote it; Based on the characteristics that most low-yield fields are far from villages, poorly managed, and have always been cultivated extensively, organize expedition teams or shock brigades to contract planting and management; Lack of fertilizer is the fundamental cause of low-yield fields. To save labor and facilitate transportation, universally establish "field-side fertilizer plants," dig manure pits in the fields, and process fertilizer on the spot to ensure sufficient fertilizer application per mu; Organize a mass movement to transform low-yield fields. Under these general measures, each commune further mobilized the masses to conduct inspections, ranking, identification, and suggestions. In response to the specific conditions of low-yield fields, specific yield-increasing measures were formulated.

### 争取晚稻大面积平衡增产  文昌县改造低产田

    争取晚稻大面积平衡增产
    文昌县改造低产田
    新华社广州22日电　海南岛文昌县总结了去年晚稻和今年早稻的丰产经验之后，在今年晚稻生产中发动了一个声势浩大的改造低产田运动。现在，全县除了有一万二千多人专管高产田以外，还有一万八千人分别到九百八十七片低产田去工作，其中70％的劳力专门去管理边远的低产田。各公社都成立了改造低产田指挥部或者委员会，各生产大队也成立了研究组，加强改造低产田的技术指导。
    文昌县在认真总结去年晚造和今年早造生产经验教训的时候，发现增产显著的公社、生产队，一般都是抓紧了改造落后片，消灭低产田的。例如，昌洒公社今年在大面积早稻田中贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，产量增加了六成多；而毗邻的文教公社，只抓高产片，忽视低产片的改造，所以虽然出现了不少高产田，总产量增加还是不多。
    文昌县对改造低产田提出了四条措施，这就是：切实加强具体领导，以便创造出低产变高产的经验，加以推广；根据低产田多数是远离乡村、管理不周和向来耕作粗放的特点，组织远征队或突击队，包种包管；缺肥是低产田的根本原因，为了节省劳力和运送方便，普遍建立“田头肥料厂”，在田头挖粪池，作到就地积、就地加工，保证亩亩施足肥料；组织群众性的改造低产田运动。在这些总的措施要求下，各个公社还进一步发动群众进行检查、排队、鉴定、献计，针对低产田的具体情况，制定具体的增产措施。
