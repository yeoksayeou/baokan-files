Diligently Study, Think Independently, Proceed Step by Step
Beijing Institute of Aeronautics Guides Students to Learn According to Their Learning Characteristics

(Our Correspondent Yu Huiyin reports) Beijing Institute of Aeronautics correctly guides students to learn according to their learning characteristics by diligently studying, thinking independently, and proceeding step by step, with good results.

In implementing the Party's educational policy, the school, on the one hand, pays attention to reasonably arranging production labor time, so that the production labor students participate in is as closely related to their major as possible; on the other hand, it also focuses on theoretical teaching. The total study hours and the study hours for basic theoretical courses throughout the year have not only not been reduced, but the school has also taken some measures to improve the quality of basic theoretical courses. Regarding the situation where some students, after returning from participating in labor, once developed a sense of unease about studying book knowledge, the school leadership promptly conducted education and quickly resolved it. Therefore, students have a high degree of enthusiasm for learning both book knowledge and practical production knowledge.

Last winter, students in some classes at Beijing Institute of Aeronautics excessively emphasized collective learning, spontaneously formulated collective exam performance targets, and carried out competitions and evaluations, wanting to use some methods from industrial and agricultural production and mass movements to improve learning efficiency. After careful investigation and research, the school Party committee determined that these methods violated the laws of learning and were inappropriate. Many students and student cadres couldn't understand this at first, so the secretary of the Party committee, the president, the academic dean, and other responsible persons patiently gave them reports, specifically talking about the characteristics and regularity of learning, the specifications for colleges and universities to train cadres, and what constitutes high learning quality. At the same time, they mobilized students to freely discuss these issues. After repeated education, the students all realized that the process of each person learning and mastering cultural and scientific knowledge is a special individual mental labor process, a gradual and long-term accumulation process, which must go through one's own independent thinking and cannot be done by others; among the students, learning foundations, intelligence, and physical conditions are different, and one should not artificially level out the good and the poor learners, but should each do their best to learn well, with the good learners striving to be even better and the poor learners striving to catch up.

As a result, the situation of excessively emphasizing collective activities and movements in learning stopped, and students' learning enthusiasm was guided towards meticulous, down-to-earth, and persistent reading and research. Many students put forward higher learning requirements: first, listen carefully to the teacher's lectures, and at the same time use their brains more, read and think more, and truly understand. In the past, students doing homework exercises were satisfied as long as they could use the theory and methods taught by the teacher to get the correct answer, but now it is different. Not long ago, students in the third grade of the third major of the first department, when doing an exercise in "Aerodynamics" on the problem of conformal mapping—converting a circle into an airfoil—saw the learning effectiveness of "drawing inferences about other cases from one instance." The students found six different typical solutions to this exercise, not counting those that were slightly different. Some of these solutions were found in reference books, and some were discovered through their own thinking, using these solutions also yielded the correct answers.

After understanding the principle of gradual progress and long-term accumulation, the phenomenon of some students not seizing the time to study during normal times and cramming before exams decreased. Many classes are seizing the time for regular review work. Whenever the teacher's lectures come to an end, the students automatically seize the time after class to do a good job of reviewing the stage. Since the beginning of this semester, each student has arranged their own study plan based on their own learning needs and other specific circumstances. Within the same self-study time, the content and progress of self-study are different. Students who originally studied well now have time to read more extracurricular reference books and conduct in-depth research on some courses and some problems. Some students in the second grade of the seventh major of the seventh department, on the basis of learning the course "Electrical Engineering Principles" well, spend a considerable amount of time, about one and a half days of free time each week, reading more professional and technical books on radio, and at the same time assembling radios themselves. Some students with a good foundation and consistently excellent academic performance, after completing the assignments assigned by the teacher, also take the initiative to find some meaningful problems in the "Exercise Selection" or discover some problems from actual life to analyze and think about in order to study in depth.

Not emphasizing the collective in learning does not exclude mutual help. Students who are behind in their studies still receive full care and assistance. When helping these students, special attention is paid to inspiring them to think for themselves, so that they have time to digest and understand, rather than "doing it for them." These methods are beginning to show results. Many students who are behind in their studies have made progress in their studies through their own hard work with the appropriate help of teachers and classmates. There was a student in the third grade of the fourth major of the third department who had a poor learning foundation. In the past, he had to take make-up exams almost every semester, but he was not discouraged and worked hard to study on his own. When he encountered problems he did not understand, he insisted on using his brain to think first. If he could solve them himself, he would definitely solve them through his own thinking. If he really could not understand, he would ask the teacher or classmates. In this way, he exercised his ability to think independently, and the knowledge he learned was more solid than before. He got his first excellent grade in the final exam this semester. Similar situations have occurred in other classes.

Now, students at Beijing Institute of Aeronautics also freely conduct discussions on some issues in the course content. This kind of discussion is different from past collective discussions; it is based on individual research. This kind of free academic discussion is also encouraged and supported by the school leadership. (Attached picture)

    刻苦读书  独立思考  循序渐进
    北京航空学院引导学生按照学习特点进行学习
    本报讯　记者余辉音报道：北京航空学院正确引导学生按照学习的特点，刻苦读书，独立思考，循序渐进，效果良好。
    这个学校在贯彻执行党的教育方针中，一方面注意合理安排了生产劳动时间，使学生们参加的生产劳动尽可能结合专业；另一方面又抓紧了理论教学，全年的总学时和基础课理论课的学时不但没有减少，学校还采取一些措施来提高基础课理论课的质量。学校领导上对有些学生参加劳动归来后一度产生不安心学习书本知识的情况，及时进行教育，很快加以解决。因此，学生们对书本知识和生产实践知识，都有较高的学习热情。
    去年冬季，北京航空学院一些班级的学生，过分地强调集体学习，自发地制定集体考试成绩指标，开展竞赛评比，想用工农业生产和群众运动中的一些方法来提高学习效率。学院党委经过认真的调查研究后认定这些方法是违反学习规律的，不妥当的。许多学生和学生干部一时还想不通，党委书记、院长、教务长等负责人，就耐心地给他们做报告，专门讲学习的特点和规律性、高等学校培养干部的规格，以及怎样才算学习质量高。同时发动学生对这些问题展开自由讨论。经过反复的教育，学生们都认识到每个人学习和掌握文化科学知识的过程，是一种特殊的个体脑力劳动过程，是一个循序渐进，长期积累的过程，必须经过自己的独立思考，不能包办代替；学生中间，学习基础、聪明才智、身体条件不同，不应人为地将学习好的与差的拉平，而应当各尽所能，力求学好，学习好的要更好，学习差的要赶上去。
    这样一来，学习上过分强调搞集体活动、搞运动的情况停止了，学生的学习热情被引导到细致踏实、坚持不懈的读书和钻研上。许多学生提出了更高的学习要求：首先认真听好教师的讲授，同时要多动脑筋，多读多想，切实领会。过去，学生做习题作业，只要能够运用教师讲授的理论和方法，得出正确答案，就满足了，现在则不同。不久以前，一系三专业三年级的学生们，在做“空气动力学”中关于保角转换问题——将圆转成一翼型的一个习题时，看出了“举一反三”的学习成效，学生们对这个习题找出了六种不同的典型解法，大同小异的还不计算在内。这些解法有些是他们在参考书上找到的，有些是经过他们自己的思考发现的，运用这些解法同样得出了正确的答案。
    懂得循序渐进、长期积累的道理后，一部分学生平时不抓紧学习，考试前开夜车突击的现象减少了。许多班级都抓紧平时的复习工作，每当教师的讲授告一段落，学生们就自动抓紧课余时间作好阶段复习。这学期以来，每个学生都是根据自己的学习需要等具体情况，安排自己的学习计划。在同一的自修时间内，自修的内容、进度各不相同。原来学习较好的学生，现在能够有时间多看一些课外参考书，对一些课程、一些问题作深入一步的钻研。七系七专业二年级的一些学生，在学好“电工原理”这门课程的基础上，每周抽出相当一个半天的课余时间，多看一些无线电方面的专业技术书籍，同时自己动手装收音机。有些基础较好、学习成绩一直比较优异的学生，完成教师指定的作业后，还主动到“习题选”中找一些有意义的题目，或从实际生活中发现一些问题，来加以分析思考，深入学习。
    学习上不强调集体，并不排斥相互帮助。学习差的学生，仍然受到了充分的关怀和帮助。在帮助这些学生的时候，特别注意启发他们自己进行思考，让他们有时间消化、领会，而不是“包办”。这些作法开始收到效果，许多学习差的学生，在教师和同学们的适当帮助下，通过自己的艰苦劳动，在学习上也有了进步。三系四专业三年级有个学习基础较差的学生，过去差不多每学期都要补考，但是他不气馁，下苦功夫自己刻苦钻研，遇到不懂的问题，坚持自己首先动脑筋思考，自己能解决的，一定要求通过自己的思考加以解决，实在弄不懂，再去问教师或同学。这样，他锻炼了自己的独立思考的能力，学的知识比以前牢固了。在这学期期终考试中他第一次得到了优良的成绩。在其他班级里都出现了类似的情况。
    现在，北京航空学院的学生，对课程内容中的一些问题还自由开展讨论。这种讨论和过去的集体讨论不同，它建立在个人钻研的基础上。这种学术上的自由讨论也受到学院领导的鼓励和支持。（附图片）
