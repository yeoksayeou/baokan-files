“Seeking a Career,” and Such
		Zhang Yijin, Graduating Student of Tsinghua University

    The United States Information Service issued a news item from Hong Kong on June 18th, saying: "This year, graduating students in mainland China cannot expect to use their summer vacation for travel, seeking a career, or participating in household chores. On the contrary, their work has been assigned." It also said: "Usually, graduation day is a day of family celebration and the display of unlimited hope for the future, but for students in today's Communist China, it presents a gloomy prospect."

    This is truly "news" to us graduating college students! It turns out that while we are happily preparing to participate in the new national construction; when we are proud to become direct participants in socialist construction, there are still these kind gentlemen complaining about our inability to "seek a career or participate in household chores." When we look to the future, filled with a feeling of riding the wind and waves, and soaring ambition, as we are about to do things that "no one has ever done before," these gentlemen say that a "gloomy prospect unfolds" before us. If it weren't clearly printed in black ink on white paper, one would hardly dare to believe it!

    Speaking of "seeking a career or participating in household chores," the gentlemen of the United States Information Service probably understand that college students in old China had such "opportunities," and in the United States, "graduation equals unemployment" is a well-known fact. Long before graduation, one had to rely on connections and find ways to "seek a career." If you were lucky enough to find a job, you could barely make a living; if you couldn't find one, you had to "participate in household chores." This is probably what the gentlemen call "unlimited hope"!

    I myself have had such an experience. In 1945, just after graduating from junior high school, my father's salary was no longer enough for me to continue my studies. On the first day of summer vacation, I woke up in the middle of the night and still heard my father's heavy footsteps pacing back and forth in the courtyard, and a long sigh: "A schoolteacher's son can't even afford to study!" From the next day on, I had no choice but to "use my summer vacation to seek a career" with tears in my eyes. I "expected" to manage books and newspapers in the "People's Education Center," and I also "expected" to become an apprentice in a traditional Chinese medicine shop, but these also failed. In the end, I had to "participate in household chores." It wasn't until the spring of 1947 that I finally got a job as a mechanic in the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau. These past events remind me of what my father used to say: "Who caused this? Who is responsible for this?"

    Now, I have regained the opportunity to study, and I am about to graduate. My classmates and I—who will never understand the tearful phrase "graduation means unemployment"—have not yet put down our books, and work is already waiting for us. Some of us will participate in scientific research, some will go to newly built factories to organize production, some will take up teaching positions, and some are preparing to continue their studies in fraternal countries. All of these, under the major premise of serving the needs of the country, fully take into account each student's aspirations, characteristics, and conditions. Therefore, no matter what the job is, we welcome it with full enthusiasm.

    After reading this "gloomy" news, looking back on the past, and looking around at the reality surrounding me, I really want to shout loudly: "This is happiness, ah! Happiness."

    As for the United States Information Service's rumors, that is not surprising. Like bats, for ten years, their only job has been to find various opportunities to spit on New China. Well, let these shameful and pitiful gentlemen "buzz, buzz, buzz" non-stop. The young generation of New China will use their unparalleled revolutionary enthusiasm and firm steps to give these rumormongers a resounding slap in the face!

### “寻找职业”之类

    “寻找职业”之类
    清华大学应届毕业生　张以进
    美国新闻处在6月18日从香港发出一条新闻说：“今年中国大陆上的毕业班学生不能企望利用暑假作一番旅行、寻找职业或者参加家务工作。相反的，他们的工作已经被规定好了。”又说：“通常说来，毕业日是一个全家欢庆和展示前途无限希望的日子，但是，它对今天共产党中国的学生说来，却展示了一个阴郁的前景。”
    这对我们这批应届毕业的大学生来说，真是一条“新闻”！原来，当我们兴高采烈地准备参加新的国家建设的时候；当我们以即将成为一个社会主义建设的直接参加者而自豪的时候，却还有这末一批好心的老爷在为我们不能“寻找职业或参加家务工作”而抱怨。当我们展望将来，以自己即将去做那些“前人不曾做过的事”而充满了乘风破浪、壮志凌云的感觉的时候，这些老爷却说在我们面前“展开了一个阴郁的前景”。假如不是明明地印在白纸上的黑字的话，真教人不敢相信呢！
    要说“寻找职业或参加家务工作”，美国新闻处的老爷们大概懂得，旧中国的大学生都有过这样的“机会”的，而在美国，“毕业即失业”更是人所周知的事。远在没有毕业以前，就得托人情、找门路“寻找职业”了。侥幸找到职业，还能混一碗饭吃；找不到呢，就只好“参加家务工作”了，这大概就是老爷们所说的“无限希望”吧！
    我自己也有过这末一段经历。1945年，刚从初中毕业，父亲的工资就不够我再读书了，刚放暑假的第一天，夜半醒来，还听到父亲在天井里沉重地踱来踱去的脚步声，一声长长的叹息：“教书匠的儿子也读不成书！”第二天起，我就只好噙着眼泪“利用暑假去寻找职业”了。我“企望”在“民众教育馆”里管管书报，也曾“企望”到中药铺去当学徒，但这些也落空了。最后只好“参加家务工作”。直到1947年春天，才算进了上海电信局当个机工。这些往事，提起它来，就使我记起那时父亲常说的话：“孰令致之？谁实为之？”
    现在，我重新获得了学习的机会，而且即将毕业了，我和我同班的同学们——他们永远不会懂得“毕业就是失业”这句充满血泪的话的。——还没有放下书本，工作就在等待着我们了，我们有的将去参加科学研究工作，有的到新建设的工厂去组织生产，有的走上了人民教师的岗位，有的准备去兄弟国家继续学习。这些，在服从国家需要的大前提下，都是充分地照顾到每一个同学的志愿、特点和条件的，因此，不论工作岗位如何，我们都以满腔的热情迎接着它。
    读了这一条“阴郁”的消息，回首往事，再环顾一下围绕在我周围的现实，我真要大声地欢叫：“这是幸福，啊！幸福。”
    至于那些美国新闻处的老爷们的造谣，那也并不是什么奇怪事。他们像蝙蝠一样，十年以来，唯一的工作，就是找寻各种机会向新中国吐唾沫。那么，就让这些可耻也可怜的先生们在那里“嗡嗡嗡”响个不停吧，新中国的青年一代会用自己的无比的革命热情和坚定的步伐，给这些造谣者一个响亮的耳光！
