New Development of Soviet-Polish Brotherly Friendship

　　During the days when the socialist family was celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Polish People's Republic, the Soviet Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Khrushchev paid a friendly visit to Poland and held talks with the Polish Party and Government leaders headed by Comrade Gomulka. The joint Soviet-Polish statement issued on July 22 pointed out the achievements made in the talks in further strengthening Soviet-Polish friendly cooperation and reaffirmed the two countries' common positions on resolving some major issues in the current international situation. This Soviet-Polish meeting is an important contribution to consolidating and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and striving for the relaxation of international tensions. It is being valued and welcomed by the people of all countries in the socialist camp and peace-loving people all over the world.

　　This meeting between the Soviet and Polish party and government leaders has created new and more favorable conditions for further strengthening the fraternal friendly cooperation between the two countries. As we all know, as early as April 1945, the Soviet Union and Poland signed the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Cooperation, which laid the foundation for the fraternal friendship between the two peoples. On this basis, the friendly cooperation between the Soviet and Polish peoples has been continuously strengthened and developed. Although there were some unpleasant things between the two countries two years ago, due to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union and Poland, this situation was quickly eliminated like a thin layer of dust. For more than two years, the Soviet Union and Poland, as equal brothers in the socialist family and as members of the Warsaw Treaty and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, have continuously strengthened their fraternal friendship, mutual assistance and cooperation in politics, economics and other aspects. The leaders of the two countries have visited each other many times; the two parties have waged a consistent struggle against revisionism, the main danger to Marxism-Leninism; the Soviet Union has continued to vigorously help Poland accelerate socialist construction, and the two countries have cooperated more closely in the economic field under the principle of socialist international division of labor; the two countries have closely cooperated and supported each other in safeguarding European security and world peace. All these have further strengthened and consolidated the fraternal friendship between the Soviet and Polish peoples. When the delegation of the Polish People's Republic visited the Soviet Union last November, Comrade Gomulka said: "The Soviet-Polish alliance is now more solid than ever." The results of this Soviet-Polish meeting not only proved this very well, but the joint statement also expressed the determination to continue to strengthen the fraternal friendship between the two countries on the ideological basis of Marxism-Leninism, expand the mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries in the political, economic and cultural fields, and continue to strive for the more consolidated unity of the socialist camp. This cannot but frustrate the enemies of socialism who are trying their best to undermine Soviet-Polish relations and the relations between socialist countries.

　　The Soviet Union and Poland discussed some major issues in the current international situation during the talks and reached complete consensus. Due to the consolidation and strength of the socialist camp and the vigorous development of the national liberation movement, imperialism today can no longer carry out expansion and aggression and impose its will on the people of all countries as it did in the past. However, imperialism is not reconciled to its decline, and it is still trying to resort to the bankrupt policy of strength. They are doing everything possible to obstruct the relaxation of international tensions and continue to carry out the "cold war" in order to promote the arms race of the entire imperialist bloc and pursue the excessive profits of monopoly capital. For this reason, maintaining peace and doing everything possible to strive for the relaxation of international tensions is still the urgent task of all peace-loving countries and people today.

　　In exploring some fundamental issues in the current international situation, the Soviet Union and Poland first paid attention to the German question and once again emphasized the necessity and urgency of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and ending the occupation regime in West Berlin. The Soviet Union and Poland suffered major sacrifices in the anti-fascist war and made significant contributions to the victory of the war. Their vital interests and the important responsibility they bear for the cause of European peace make it impossible for them not to pay close attention to the development of the German situation. Due to the resurgence of West German militarist forces and the increasingly exposed revanchist and expansionist face of the West German ruling group headed by Adenauer, the security of Germany's neighboring countries is being seriously threatened, and the heart of Europe is once again lurking with the danger of another war. In order to stop the revival of West German militarism and block the path for West Germany to re-expand and invade, a peace treaty with Germany must first be concluded. At the same time, in order to eliminate a dangerous source of internal German and East-West conflict, the occupation regime of the Western countries in West Berlin must also be ended. Only in this way can a path be opened up for resolving the entire German question and creating the premise for the peaceful and democratic reunification of Germany.

　　Now, the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference discussing the German question is continuing in Geneva. However, the recent situation of the meeting shows that, despite the sincere expectation of the people of all countries in the world that the meeting will make progress in resolving the issues of the German peace treaty and ending the occupation regime in West Berlin, and despite the repeated efforts made by the representatives of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic at the meeting, the foreign ministers of the Western countries still adhere to their stubborn positions and do not relax their outdated occupation rights in West Berlin in the slightest. They would rather let the meeting fall into empty talk than seek a basis for agreement even on partial issues. The Western countries are now trying their best to oppose the proposal to establish an all-German committee, although they have also made similar proposals in the past. The leaders of the Western countries, especially U.S. President Eisenhower, have recently repeatedly emphasized the view that whether the summit meeting is held depends on the progress of the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference. And what he calls "progress" is to maintain the Western occupation of West Berlin indefinitely. The representative of the Adenauer government played a more shameful role at the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference, impatiently preparing to disrupt the meeting, and even openly put forward the unreasonable demand to interrupt the meeting. This attitude of the Western countries cannot but arouse the vigilance and anxiety of all those who hope that the international situation will tend to ease. However, if the Western countries brazenly interrupt the meeting, they will inevitably be condemned by world opinion.

　　In order to strive for the easing of tensions in the European region and promote the development of normal relations between European countries, the Soviet and Polish leaders also reiterated in the joint statement the proposals for establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Central European region, the Baltic Sea region and the Balkan Peninsula region. Although the ruling groups of the Western countries have repeatedly rejected these proposals that help consolidate European peace, these proposals are in line with the vital interests of the entire Europe, especially the people of the countries in the relevant regions, and they are receiving more and more support among the people. They will gradually pave the way for their realization.

　　This meeting between the Soviet and Polish leaders has added a new page to the traditional friendship between the Soviet Union and Poland, which is an important factor in the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the maintenance of peace in Europe and the world.

    苏波兄弟友谊的新发展
    在社会主义大家庭欢庆波兰人民共和国国庆十五周年的日子里，由赫鲁晓夫同志率领的苏联党政代表团在波兰进行了友好访问，并同以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰党政领导人举行了会谈。7月22日发表的苏波两国联合声明，指出了这次会谈在进一步加强苏波友好合作上所取得的成果并重申了两国对于解决当前国际局势中的一些重大问题的共同主张。苏波两国的这次会谈，对于巩固和加强社会主义阵营的团结和争取国际紧张局势的缓和，是一个重要的贡献。它正受到社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的重视和欢迎。
    这次苏波两国党政领导人的会谈，为进一步加强苏波两国兄弟般的友好合作创造了新的更有利的条件。大家知道，早在1945年4月，苏波两国就签订了友好、互助和战后合作条约，这个条约奠定了苏波两国人民兄弟友谊的基础。在这个基础上，苏波两国人民的友好合作不断加强和发展。虽然两年前两国之间曾经存在过一些不顺利的事情，但是，由于苏波两国的共同努力，这种情况很快就像一层薄薄的尘埃一样被消除了。两年多以来，苏波两国作为社会主义大家庭中平等的兄弟，作为华沙条约和经济互助委员会的成员，在政治、经济等各方面，不断地加强着兄弟般的友好、互助和合作。两国领导人多次相互访问；两国党对马克思列宁主义的主要危险修正主义一致进行了斗争；苏联继续大力帮助波兰加速社会主义建设，两国在社会主义国际分工的原则下，在经济方面更加密切地互助合作；在保卫欧洲安全和世界和平方面，两国紧密地配合和互相支持。所有这些，使苏波两国人民的兄弟友谊进一步加强和巩固了。去年11月波兰人民共和国代表团在苏联访问时，哥穆尔卡同志说过：“波苏联盟现在比任何时期都巩固。”这次苏波会谈的结果不仅很好地证明了这一点，而且联合声明中表示决心，今后将继续加强两国在马克思列宁主义思想基础上的兄弟友谊，扩大两国政治、经济和文化方面的互助合作，并且继续争取社会主义阵营的更加巩固的团结。这就不能不使那些千方百计地企图破坏苏波关系和社会主义国家之间关系的社会主义的敌人落空了。
    苏波两国在会谈中讨论了当前国际局势中的一些重大问题，并取得了完全一致的看法。由于社会主义阵营的巩固强大和民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，帝国主义今天已不能再像过去那样为所欲为地进行扩张侵略，把自己的意志强加在各国人民的身上了。但帝国主义并不甘心于自己的没落，它们仍然企图乞灵于已经破产了的实力政策。它们千方百计地阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，继续进行“冷战”，以便推动整个帝国主义集团的扩军备战，追求垄断资本的超额利润。正因如此，维护和平和尽一切力量来争取国际局势的缓和，今天仍然是所有爱好和平的国家和人民的迫切任务。
    在探讨当前国际局势中的一些根本问题时，苏波两国首先注意到了德国问题，并再一次强调缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度的必要性与迫切性。苏联和波兰在反法西斯战争中遭受了重大的牺牲，并对战争的胜利作出了重大的贡献。它们的切身利益和它们对欧洲和平事业所担负的重任，使它们不能不密切注视着德国局势的发展。由于西德军国主义势力的东山再起和以阿登纳为首的西德统治集团的日益暴露其复仇主义和对外扩张的面目，德国邻国的安全正在受到严重的威胁，欧洲的心脏地带也重新潜伏着另一次战争的危险。为了制止西德军国主义的复活和堵塞西德重新扩张侵略的道路，就必须首先缔结对德和约。同时，为了消除德国内部和东西方冲突的一个危险根源，也必须结束西方国家在西柏林的占领制度。只有如此，才能为解决整个德国问题开辟道路，为实现德国的和平民主统一创造前提。
    现在，讨论德国问题的东西方外长会议正在日内瓦继续举行。但是，最近会议的情况表明，尽管世界各国人民真诚地期望会议在解决对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度问题上取得进展，尽管苏联和德意志民主共和国代表在会上作了一再的努力，西方国家的外长们却仍然坚持它们的顽固立场，丝毫也不放松它们在西柏林的早已过时了的占领权利。它们宁肯让会议陷于空谈而不愿在即使是局部的问题上寻求协议的基础。西方国家现在竭力反对建立全德委员会的建议，虽然它们过去也曾提出过类似的主张。西方国家的领导人物，特别是美国总统艾森豪威尔，最近又一再强调这样的观点，即政府首脑会议是否召开必须取决于东西方外长会议的进展。而他所谓的“进展”，就是要无限期地保持西方在西柏林的占领权。阿登纳政府的代表在东西方外长会议上扮演了更加可耻的角色，迫不及待地准备破坏会议，甚至公然提出中断会议的无理要求。西方国家的这种态度，不能不引起一切希望国际局势趋向缓和的人们的警惕和忧虑。但是，如果西方国家悍然中断会议，那就必然会受到全世界舆论的谴责。
    为了争取欧洲地区紧张局势的缓和与促进欧洲各国正常关系的发展，苏波两国领导人还在联合声明中重申了关于在中欧地带、波罗的海地区和巴尔干半岛地区建立无原子武器区的建议。尽管西方国家的统治集团已一再拒绝这些有助于巩固欧洲和平的建议，但这些建议却符合整个欧洲特别是有关地区各国人民的切身利益，它们在人民中间正在得到越来越多的支持。它们将会为自己的实现而逐渐开辟道路。
    苏波两国领导人的这次会谈为苏波传统友谊添写了新的一页，这种友谊是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国牢不可破的团结和维护欧洲与世界和平的重要因素。
