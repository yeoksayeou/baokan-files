Shiitake mushrooms, also known as "fragrant mushrooms," are a type of basidiomycete fungus that parasitizes the bark of decaying wood segments. The underside of the shiitake mushroom cap has many narrow, elongated sheets called "gills." The gills are covered with countless spores, and shiitake mushrooms reproduce by means of these mature spores. In areas where shiitake mushrooms have grown, they can naturally reproduce on their own if the temperature and humidity are suitable. Artificial cultivation is done to obtain shiitake mushrooms of better quality and higher yield.

Shiitake mushrooms are mainly used for food and are a top-grade ingredient in dishes. They also have certain medicinal uses. More than one hundred counties in provinces and regions such as Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou in China produce shiitake mushrooms, with Fujian and Jiangxi producing the most and the best quality.

The tree species suitable for cultivating shiitake mushrooms in China include: sawtooth oak, white oak, Mongolian oak, chestnut, cyclobalanopsis, castanopsis, schima superba, and so on. The "mushroom wood" for producing shiitake mushrooms should be felled in late autumn or early winter of the previous year, leaving the branches and leaves to dry naturally. In March or April of the current year, the branches and twigs are cut off, and the wood is sawn into sections of five or six feet long. Slanted cuts (called "flower cuts") are made around the wood, spaced five or six inches apart and one or two fen deep. The shiitake mushrooms are sown on these "mushroom wood."

The "mushroom farm" for propagating shiitake mushrooms should be located in a place with a gentle slope, facing east or southeast, well-ventilated, and moist. To ensure ventilation, the "mushroom wood" should be arranged in a stepped or centipede shape.

Shiitake mushrooms generally begin to grow after the Double Ninth Festival, with the most growth occurring between the "Winter Solstice" and "Qingming." Shiitake mushrooms harvested in winter are called "winter mushrooms," which have thick caps and good quality. Those with white crack patterns resembling chrysanthemums on the cap surface are called "flower mushrooms," and are of the best quality. Those that grow in spring and autumn generally have open and scattered caps, thin flesh, and long stems, and are of relatively lower quality.

Shiitake mushrooms should be harvested when the cap is six or seven-tenths open. Some producing areas have the habit of selling fresh mushrooms. For easy storage and transportation, most producing areas dry or bake the fresh mushrooms for sale.

Shiitake mushrooms are a delicious, nutritious, storable, and easily transportable specialty dried vegetable. Shiitake mushrooms are not only a popular food among the people of China, but also an export commodity. Exporting one ton of shiitake mushrooms can exchange for twenty tons of steel.

Producing shiitake mushrooms consumes a large amount of wood, which has a certain conflict with timber production. However, this contradiction can be gradually resolved. Judging from some situations, in areas with a foundation for shiitake mushroom production, designating a part of the forest as a base for shiitake mushroom production, changing the past extensive management to intensive management, using curved wood, branches with little economic value, and carrying out technological innovations to find a wide range of alternative raw materials, are all some methods that can be tried to save wood. If major shiitake mushroom producing areas have long-term plans and replant forests in a timely manner after felling trees, shiitake mushroom production can be carried out continuously.

    香菇是怎样生产的
    承贵
    香菇又叫“香蕈”是一种寄生在腐朽木段的树皮下面，属于担子菌类的植物。香菇菌伞的底面有很多狭长的薄片，叫“菌折”。菌折上面长着无数的孢子，香菇就依靠成熟的孢子繁殖。在生长过香菇的地区，如果温度和湿度合适，它可以自行天然繁殖。人工培育它，是为了得到质量更好、产量更高的香菇。
    香菇主要供食用，是菜肴中的上品，同时在医药上也有一定的用处。我国福建、江西、安徽、浙江、广东、广西、湖南、湖北、四川、贵州等省区，有一百多个县都产香菇，其中以福建、江西产的最多最好。
    我国适宜培养香菇的树种有：麻栎、白栎、槲栎、栗树、青冈、栲树、木荷等等。生产香菇的“菇木”要在前一年秋末冬初砍倒，留着枝叶使其自然干燥，到当年3、4月再砍去枝丫，锯成五、六尺长的木段，并在周围砍成相距五、六寸，深一、二分的斜口（叫“砍花”）。香菇就是播种在这些“菇木”上。
    繁殖香菇的“菇场”要选择坡度不大，东向或东南向、通风良好、湿润的地方。为了通风，“菇木”要排列成阶梯形或蜈蚣形。
    香菇一般在重阳节后开始发生，“冬至”到“清明”间长出的最多。冬天采摘的香菇叫“冬菇”，菌伞厚，品质好。伞面上有形似菊花的白色裂纹的叫“花菇”，品质最好。春秋季生长的，一般菌伞开散、肉薄、柄长，品质较次。
    采摘香菇要在菌伞张开六、七分的时候最好。有些产区有出售鲜菇的习惯。为了便于贮藏和运输，多数产区都是把鲜菇晒干或烘干出售。
    香菇是一种味美、有营养、耐贮藏和便于运输的特产干菜。香菇不仅是国内广大人民喜爱的食品，同时也是一种出口物资。出口一吨香菇，可换二十吨钢材。
    生产香菇要消耗较多的木材，和木材生产上是有一定矛盾的。但是这个矛盾是可以逐步解决的。从一些情况看，在生产香菇有基础的地区，划定一部分林子作为生产香菇的基地，改变过去的粗放经营为集约经营和改用弯曲木材、经济价值不大的枝丫，以及开展技术革新，寻找广阔的代用原料，都是一些可以试用的节约木材的办法。香菇主要产区，如果订有长远规划，在砍伐树木以后及时更新造林，就能够连续不断的进行香菇生产。
