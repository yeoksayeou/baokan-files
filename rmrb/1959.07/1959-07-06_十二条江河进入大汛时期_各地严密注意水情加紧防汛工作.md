Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: Twelve major rivers in China, including the Yangtze River, Huai River, Yellow River, and Hai River, have entered the peak flood season in July. All regions are closely monitoring water conditions and intensifying flood prevention work.

Rainfall occurred throughout the country in June. South of the Yangtze River, especially in the Pearl River basin, rainfall was the heaviest, exceeding the average for the same period in previous years. North of the Yangtze River, rainfall in the Yellow River and Huai River basins was similar to previous years, but rainfall in Northeast China was less than in previous years. According to meteorological forecasts, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River, and the Songhua River basin in Northeast China will experience rain in early July.

Flood prevention preparations are actively underway along the Yangtze River, Huai River, and Yellow River. Mass flood control and rescue teams, transportation teams, water condition forecasting teams, and patrol teams have mostly been organized. In Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, flood prevention tasks for the first, second, and third lines of the Huai River embankments have been assigned to specific individuals. In Jingzhou Prefecture, Hubei Province, a flood prevention team of 60,000 people is on standby. Flood prevention materials are continuing to be collected and transported. Flood prevention departments along the Yellow River have registered large quantities of willow branches, grass bags, and other flood prevention materials from government offices, enterprises, and the masses (the state will pay for them when used). Most of the stone materials that the state plans to allocate to the Yellow River have also been transported to areas along the river. Flood prevention timber, iron wire, and other materials for the Huai River are being continuously transported to flood prevention construction sites. For the Songhua River, the timber needed for flood prevention has begun to be transferred to areas along the river, and some areas are producing and collecting the needed grass bags.

Currently, in addition to strengthening flood prevention work on the dikes and embankments of major rivers, all regions have also inspected and repaired small and medium-sized reservoirs, river channels, embankments, culverts, and other projects. Relevant departments in Anhui Province inspected nine large sluice gates, including the Baligiao sluice gate in Huaibei, and proposed renovation suggestions. At the same time, they also repaired the opening and closing equipment of the Bei Fei sluice gate in Wuhe County and others. To comprehensively strengthen flood prevention work, the Central Flood Control Headquarters recently held national conferences on small and medium-sized reservoirs in southern and northern China in Wuhan and Baoding, respectively.

    十二条江河进入大汛时期
    各地严密注意水情加紧防汛工作
    新华社5日讯　7月，长江、淮河、黄河、海河等我国主要十二河都进入了大汛时期。各地正严密注意水情和加紧防汛工作。
    全国各地在6月份都下了雨。长江以南，特别是珠江流域一带雨量最大，超过了历年同期的雨量。长江以北，黄河淮河流域的雨量和往年差不多，但东北地区的雨量比往年少。据气象部门预报：7月上旬，长江上游、淮河中下游和东北的松花江流域等地区都将有雨。
    长江、淮河和黄河沿岸各地的防汛准备正在积极进行，群众性的防汛抢险队、运输队、水情预报队、巡逻队等队伍大都组织就绪。安徽省阜阳专区各县把淮河堤防一、二、三线的防汛任务已分配到人。湖北省荆州专区由六万人组成的防汛队伍在随时听命出发。各地的防汛物料在继续筹集和调运中。黄河两岸的防汛部门向机关、企业和群众登记了大批的柳枝、草袋等防汛用物（用时国家付款），国家计划调给黄河的石料，也大部运到沿河地区。淮河的防汛木材、铁丝等正源源运向防汛工地。松花江防汛所需的木料，有些已开始向沿江地区调动，所需的草袋，有些地区正在生产和筹集。
    目前，各地除加强了大江河的堤防工程的防汛工作外，对中小型水库、河道、堤防、涵闸等工程也进行了检查和抢修。安徽省有关部门对淮北的八里桥等九座大闸检查后提出了整修意见，同时，还修理了五河县的北淝闸等的启闭设备。为了全面的加强防汛工作，中央防汛总指挥部近日在武汉和保定分别召开全国南方和北方中小水库会议。
