Railway Workers Love Sleepers
Sleeper Preservation and Repair Work Continuously Strengthened

(Our dispatch) Railway workers across the country are actively carrying out a "Love Sleepers" campaign, strengthening the preservation and repair of sleepers.

The railway department needs a large number of sleepers every year. According to this year's plan for constructing new and old lines, more than 10 million sleepers will be needed throughout the year. Sleepers are often subject to wind, rain, sun, insect and fungal erosion, and the pressure of trains, making them prone to damage. Protecting and conserving sleepers is very important.

In recent years, the railway department has done a lot of work in strengthening sleeper preservation, carrying out preventive comprehensive repair of sleepers, and utilizing waste sleeper splicing, achieving significant results. Under the condition of ensuring construction needs and transportation safety, the number of new sleepers used per kilometer has decreased. Last year, the mileage of extended lines and the volume of transportation both increased significantly compared to 1954, while the number of new sleepers used per kilometer decreased by half.

In order to strengthen sleeper preservation treatment, the railway department has newly built and expanded six sleeper preservation factories in Sujiatun, Sankeshu, Hanyang, Liuzhou, Chengdu, and Tongxian in recent years. The annual output of oil-impregnated sleepers (sleepers that have undergone preservation treatment) has increased from 60,000 in 1949 to 8 million. The quality of oil-impregnated sleepers is also continuously improving, and the service life can now reach more than twelve years.

In order to save timber, relevant departments successfully developed a type of reinforced concrete sleeper in 1957. Now there are several standard types of this sleeper, and factories have been built to manufacture them. More than 100,000 reinforced concrete sleepers were produced last year, and many have now been laid on the lines.

The mass "Love Sleepers" campaign has effectively extended the service life of sleepers. Many railway bureau workers apply preservative agents to the sleepers; tie sleepers with cracks with iron wire; dig out the decayed parts of the sleepers, inlay them with good wood, and continue to use them; and splice sleepers that are removed from the main lines for use on station lines. At present, the railway annually replaces about 5 million sleepers, of which 900,000 can be spliced and reused. Last year alone, 6.39 million sleepers were coated with slurry paste (preservative agent) on national railway lines, 32 million sleepers underwent comprehensive repairs, and 910,000 sleepers were spliced and reused, equivalent to saving the country 2 million sleepers. Last year, relevant departments also successfully tested the use of phenolic resin as a glue for joining sleepers, and the quality was better than iron wire bundling and splicing. Now, the Jinan, Beijing, Taiyuan and other railway administrations have all used this glued sleeper. (Attached picture)

### 铁路职工爱枕木  枕木防腐和修理工作不断加强

    铁路职工爱枕木
    枕木防腐和修理工作不断加强
    本报讯　全国铁路部门的职工积极开展爱护枕木运动，加强枕木的防腐和修理工作。
    铁路部门每年需要大量枕木。按照今年新旧线修建计划，全年就需要枕木一千多万根。而枕木经常受风吹、雨淋、日晒、虫菌侵蚀及行车震压，容易损坏，保护和节约枕木工作十分重要。
    几年来，铁路部门曾在加强枕木防腐、开展枕木预防性综合修理、废枕木拼接利用等方面做了很多工作，取得了显著的成效。在保证建设需要和运输安全的条件下，每公里使用新枕木的数量下降了。去年线路延长的里数和运输量都比1954年增加很多，而每公里使用的新枕木却减少了一半。
  　为了加强枕木防腐处理，铁路部门几年来新建扩建了苏家屯、三棵树、汉阳、柳州、成都、通县等六个枕木防腐工厂，注油枕木（经过防腐处理的枕木）年产量由1949年的六万根增加到八百万根，注油枕木的质量也不断提高，使用年限目前可达到十二年以上。
    为了节约木材，有关部门在1957年研究成功一种钢筋混凝土轨枕，现在这种轨枕已有几种定型，并修建了制造这种轨枕的工厂。去年制出的十万多根钢筋混凝土轨枕，现在很多已铺设在线路上。
    群众性的爱护枕木运动，有效地延长了枕木使用寿命。许多铁路局的职工在枕木上涂抹防腐药剂；把有裂纹的枕木用铁丝扎起来，把枕木腐朽部分挖掉，再镶上好的木料，继续使用；从正线上换下来的枕木，能拼接使用的就拼起来在站线上使用。现在，铁路每年抽换下来的枕木约五百万根，可拼接继续使用的有九十万根。去年一年，全国铁路线路上涂抹浆膏（防腐药剂）的枕木有六百三十九万根，经过综合修理的枕木有三千二百万根，经过拼接再用的枕木有九十一万根，等于给国家节约枕木二百万根。去年，有关部门还试用酚醛树脂作胶合枕木成功，质量比铁线捆扎拼接好。现在，济南、北京、太原等铁路管理局都已使用这种胶合枕木。（附图片）
