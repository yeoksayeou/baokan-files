    The Cabbage Family
    Zhu Mi

    Cabbage (commonly known as foreign cabbage) and her many sisters make up a very interesting family.
    Several thousand years ago, the residents of the Mediterranean coast obtained wild cabbage with thick roots, long bodies, and small leaves from the steep shores, and forced it to settle in moist and fertile near-water areas.
    Wild cabbage grew and reproduced happily.
    Different regions and different owners developed different interests in wild cabbage. Everyone selected plants that conformed to their own preferences for seed retention, and cut away those they didn't like. After a long period of time, like the domestication process of many wild plants, wild cabbage became cultivated cabbage. And it fully embodies the diligent wishes of its masters: some flower parts developed to be particularly large, fleshy, and tender, becoming a precious vegetable – cauliflower; some grew clusters of small leaf balls on the plant, which people call Brussels sprouts; some became the wrinkled-leaf cabbage that livestock love to eat; some stems swelled into balls, which people call kohlrabi; in addition, there is ornamental kale; and there is Chinese kale, which is eaten for its tender leaves and flower spikes...
    In Western Europe, cabbage (kohlrabi) is generally called "Cabbage." This word evolved from the Latin word for "head." This is probably because the head of cabbage resembles a human head! Cabbage also has many beautiful names in our country: in the hometown of Chinese cabbage – North China – it is mostly called "foreign cabbage"; in many places in the central region, it is called "lotus white"; in the south, which is rich in coconuts, everyone calls it "coconut cabbage," naturally because the head of cabbage resembles a coconut; only in Qinghai do people call it "big-headed vegetable," which is similar to the meaning of the Western European term.
    The head of cabbage can be seen as a huge mixed bud, and more than 92% of this bud is water. Someone once calculated that for every pound of cabbage harvested, the soil has to give up one hundred pounds of water. This number is not small! In fact, cabbage is also trying its best to save water. For example: it wraps the head tightly to minimize water evaporation, and even the spreading outer leaves are sprinkled with a layer of water-retaining wax powder.
    Cabbage has been eaten for a long time. It is now known that ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage as a dessert after meals. The ancient mathematician Grätz Pythagoras once interestingly said that cabbage is a good vegetable that can keep people full of energy, and have a peaceful and happy mood.
    In modern times, cabbage has also attracted attention due to its rich nutrition, especially its high vitamin C content. In 1907, two doctors discovered that cabbage and other vegetables could treat scurvy in guinea pigs, which became one of the clues for the subsequent discovery of vitamin C. It is a pity that most of the vitamin C in cabbage is in the outer leaves, but this does not diminish the value of cabbage. Because cabbage contains a variety of nutrients, has a unique flavor, is highly adaptable, has a high yield, is easy to manage, is resistant to storage and transportation, and can also be dried, salted, pickled, etc., it has become a major player in vegetable gardens and large vegetable bases.

    甘兰世家
    朱米
    甘兰（俗称洋白菜）和她的众姊妹们组成了一个十分有趣的家族。
    几千年前地中海沿岸的居民们，从陡峭的海岸上得到了根粗身长叶子小的野生甘兰，并迫使它定居在润湿肥沃的近水地带。
    野生甘兰愉快地生长繁殖着。
    不同地区、不同的主人对野生甘兰发生了不同的兴趣，大家都选用符合自己爱好的植株来留种，把自己不喜欢的砍去。这样经过了漫长的岁月，与许多野生植物的驯化过程一样，野生甘兰变成了栽培甘兰。并充分地体现了主人的殷勤愿望：有的花部发育得特别肥大鲜嫩而成为珍贵的蔬菜——花椰菜；有的在植株上结了累累的小叶球，人们叫它抱子甘兰；有的成为牲口爱吃的皱叶甘兰；有的茎部膨大成球，人们叫它球茎甘兰；此外有可供观赏的羽衣甘兰；有以嫩叶及花苔为食的芥兰……。
    在西欧一般把甘兰（球茎甘兰）称做“卡拜基”。这个词是从拉丁文——头颅这个词演化而来。这大概是由于甘兰的叶球很像人的脑袋吧！甘兰在我国也有不少美称：在大白菜的故乡——华北一带多称之为“洋白菜”；在中部许多地方称之为“莲花白”；在盛产椰子的南方大家又管它叫“椰菜”，这自然是因为甘兰叶球好似椰球；只有在青海有人称它为“大头菜”，这倒与西欧名词的来义相近。
    甘兰的叶球可看成是一个巨大的混合芽，这个芽内有92％以上是水分。曾有人计算过，每收获一斤甘兰，土壤就要付出一百斤水。这个数字可不小！其实甘兰也在想尽一切办法来节省水。例如：它把叶球包得紧紧地尽量减少水分蒸发，即使开张的外叶上也撒上一层保水的蜡粉。
    甘兰作为食用已是很久的事了。现在已经知道古代埃及人在饭后把煮熟的甘兰当甜点心吃。古代数学家格莱茨·毕法戈尔曾有趣地说过，甘兰是一种好蔬菜，它能使人们经常精神饱满，心境宁静愉快。
    在近代，甘兰也是由于营养丰富而被人注意的。尤其含维生素丙很多。在1907年就有两位医生发现甘兰及其它蔬菜可治疗天竺鼠的坏血病，这事成为以后发现维生素丙的线索之一。可惜甘兰的维生素丙多在外叶中，但并不因此贬低甘兰的身价。由于甘兰含有多种养分，风味独特、适应性强、产量高、管理方便及耐贮运，以及还可晒干、盐渍、酸渍等等，使它成为菜园中和大型蔬菜基地中的主要角色。
