Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 12th: The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee recently convened a telephone conference, requesting all steel enterprise workers in the province to continue to exert their energy, widely launch high-quality, high-yield red flag competitions, and ensure a complete success in iron, steel, and steel material production in July, laying the foundation for the comprehensive overfulfillment of the third-quarter plan.

    Yang Chunfu, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, arranged the July steel production plan at the meeting, and proposed important measures to complete the July steel production task. He first pointed out: Plans, whether annual, monthly, or daily, must be firmly grasped. While exerting efforts and striving for overproduction, it is also necessary to firmly grasp the improvement of product quality. Poor steel quality will affect the quality of other products, especially mechanical products. He asked the enterprise Party committees to focus on quality in July and achieve rapid results.

    Yang Chunfu said: Equipment maintenance is a major "hurdle" in current production. Poor equipment will affect this year's tasks and next year's production preparations. Therefore, after the factories and mines have formulated measures and plans for this work, they must have dedicated personnel responsible for supervising their implementation. Yang Chunfu also asked all enterprises to intensify efforts in heat prevention, cooling, rain prevention, and flood control, as well as to improve enterprise management and rapidly establish and improve necessary systems to ensure increased output, improved quality, reduced costs, and safe production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 12th: Shandong will produce more and better iron ore in the second half of the year to supply the steel industry. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Shandong Provincial Metallurgical Industry Bureau convened a provincial seven-level cadre representative conference on metallurgical mines in early July, and made comprehensive arrangements for mine work in the second half of the year. The meeting determined that iron ore production in the second half of the year should increase by 6.5% compared to the first half of the year. Quality requirements include a sulfur content of no more than 0.3% in the ore. Labor productivity (including stripping, tunneling, and mining efficiency) should increase by 10% to 15%, and average costs should be reduced by 10% to 16%.

    In order to comprehensively achieve the above planned targets, the meeting decided to immediately launch a production increase and conservation movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution in all iron mines. The meeting required all localities to strengthen geological work in mine production, carefully formulate development plans, and conduct stripping and mining in a planned and purposeful manner to ensure sufficient recoverable reserves. At the same time, strengthen ore selection in production and transportation, and establish and improve the inspection and acceptance system for ore quality to ensure ore quality. It also required all mines to improve mining methods, rectify labor organizations, and ensure that all types of work cooperate with each other and that shifts and teams are closely connected to reduce manpower waste and increase labor productivity. The meeting also put forward specific requirements for strengthening equipment maintenance, strengthening cost management and enterprise management, and establishing and improving necessary rules and regulations.

    辽宁力争七月钢铁生产满堂红
    山东下半年将增产更多更好的铁矿石
    新华社沈阳12日电　中共辽宁省委最近召开电话会议，要求全省钢铁企业职工继续鼓足干劲，广泛开展优质、高产红旗竞赛，保证7月份铁、钢和钢材生产满堂红，为全面超额完成第三季度计划打下基础。
    中共辽宁省委书记杨春甫代表省委在会上布置了7月份钢铁生产计划，提出了完成7月份钢铁生产任务的重要措施。他首先指出：不论年、月、日的计划都要狠狠地抓，在鼓足干劲，力争超产的同时，还要狠抓产品质量的提高。钢铁质量不好，会影响其他产品特别是机械产品的质量。他要求企业党委在7月份要突出地抓质量，并且要迅速见效。
    杨春甫说：设备维护是当前生产上的一大“关口”，设备不好就要影响到今年的任务和明年的生产准备工作。因此，要求各厂矿对这项工作订出措施计划之后，要有专人负责，督促实现。杨春甫还要求各企业抓紧防暑、降温、防雨、防汛等工作，以及搞好企业管理，迅速建立和健全必要的制度，以保证增加产量、提高质量，降低成本，安全生产。
    新华社济南12日电　山东下半年将生产更多更好的铁矿石供应钢铁工业。中共山东省委及山东省冶金工业局在7月上旬召开了全省冶金矿山七级干部代表会议，对下半年的矿山工作作了全面安排。会议确定下半年铁矿石产量比上半年增长6.5％，质量要求矿石含硫量不超过0.3％，劳动生产率（包括剥离、掘进、采矿等效率）提高10％到15％，平均成本降低10％到16％。
    为了全面实现上述计划指标，会议决定立即在各个铁矿山深入地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。会议要求各地加强矿山生产的地质工作，认真制定开拓方案，做到有计划、有目的地剥离与开采，保证获得足够的可采储量。同时在生产、装运中加强矿石挑选，建立与健全矿石质量的检查、验收制度，以保证矿石质量。还要求各个矿山改进采矿方法，整顿劳动组织，作到各工种互相配合，班与班、队与队之间密切衔接，减少人力浪费，提高劳动生产率。在加强设备维修、加强成本管理和企业管理，建立和健全必要的规章制度等方面，会议也提出了具体要求。
