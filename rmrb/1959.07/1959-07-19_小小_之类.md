    "Little..." and Such
    Qin Li
    Some time ago, while reading literary journals, I came across a relatively short essay with the words "Small Essay" marked under the title, which surprised me at the time!
    Recently, I read the June issue of "Literary Monthly," which included a work entitled "Young People," labeled as "Little Little Film Script" below. The two are similar in nature, except that the latter adds another "Little" after the "Little" character.
    There are many styles of literary works, such as novels, essays, poems, and plays, and some styles are constantly developing and creating. For example, in addition to novels and short stories, there is also a "mini-novel."
    We cannot look at problems from the surface. We cannot simply create so-called "Small Essay" or "Little Little Film Script" based on the length of the article. For example, essays themselves come in various lengths. What is the difference between short essays that are not labeled "Small Essay" and those that are labeled? If there is no distinction between the two, then the significance of seeking novelty is lost. If it is only to promote brevity, then by analogy, wouldn't there also be "Little Little Feature," "Little Little Fairy Tale," "Little Little Essay," "Little Little Poem," and so on? I think this will only increase confusion in people's understanding and is not very beneficial to literary creation.

    “小小……”之类
    秦犁
    前些时候读文艺刊物，见有一篇文字比较短小的散文，题目下标出“小散文”字样，当时颇觉意外！
    近读6月号“文艺月报”，其中有一篇题为“年青人”的作品，下面标名为“小小电影剧本”，两者性质类似，只是后者在“小”字后面又加了个“小”字。
    文学作品的样式有多种多样，如小说、散文、诗、剧本等，而且有的样式还不断发展、创造，比如除了长篇小说、短篇小说之外，还有个“小小说”。
    我们不能从表面现象上看问题，不能仅以篇幅的长短来制造所谓“小散文”或“小小电影剧本”之类的名称。例如散文本身原来就有长有短，不标“小散文”的短篇散文和标了名的究竟有什么分别呢？如果两者毫无区分，那也就失去标新立异的意义了。如果仅仅是为了提倡篇幅短小，凡此类推下去，不是还要有“小小特写”、“小小童话”、“小小杂文”、“小小小诗”之类了吗？我以为，这只能给人们增加认识上的混乱，实际上对文学创作是益处不大的。
