    Impressionism
    Wu Jiafeng

    The Impressionist school was founded by a group of young painters who gathered in Paris, France in the late nineteenth century. The first of these painters to appear on the art scene was Edouard Manet. In his 1863 work "Luncheon on the Grass," he began to show a special interest in light and color. Influenced by Manet, other painters began to paint outdoors in sunlight, further exploring the changes in light and color in nature. They all worked hard to paint in a new way, discussed and influenced each other. In 1874, they held their first large-scale exhibition in Paris, calling themselves the "Exhibition of the Anonymous Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers, etc." What was displayed there were novel works that shocked the people of the time. The most eye-catching painting was a landscape by Claude Monet, depicting a hazy waterscape with a dazzling red sun emerging in the sky, titled "Impression, Sunrise." To people at the time, this painting was not only unique in its painting method, but also in its title. At that time, a critic published a review mocking the exhibition; the title of this review was taken from Monet's painting, called "Exhibition of Impressionist Painters." Since then, the name "Impressionism" has spread, and the group of painters themselves accepted it, so it has been used ever since, becoming the name of a school in art history.

    As the name suggests, Impressionist painters paint based on a momentary impression. But they don't "get an impression and go home to paint it," on the contrary, they love to take their entire painting gear to the field to sketch, and complete their works "on site." Before this, painters generally stayed in their studios, relying on sketches to paint. These two different painting methods produce two different painting styles. Generally speaking, older Western paintings are more meticulous in their painting techniques, but simpler in color. For example, leaves are often light green or dark green, and tree trunks are often light brown or dark brown. In reality, the colors of the objective world are by no means so simple. Impressionist paintings pay more attention to the rich color changes in nature. According to the theory and method of Impressionism, leaves are not necessarily simply green, and tree trunks are not necessarily simply brown. Due to the irradiation of different sunlight, different air changes, and the mutual reflection of colors between leaves and tree trunks, very complex color changes will be presented. Therefore, looking closely at Impressionist paintings, one often sees only rough brushstrokes and colorful blocks of color, but when viewed from a distance, one can see a real scene, just as we see it in the sunlight on weekdays.

    In addition, Impressionist painters also pay attention to the "overall impression" of the scene, that is to say, they do not look at the scene in detail locally, but "observe simultaneously" the entire scene, get an overall impression in this way, and then paint this "impression" relatively quickly.

    In short, the main characteristics of Impressionist painting are its emphasis on expressing the changes of light and color and the overall impression of the scene.

    Light and color are important factors in painting, and should be studied. Impressionist painters have made certain contributions in this regard. Monet, mentioned above, is a typical figure of Impressionism. He painted the same haystack as a subject fifteen times, solely for the purpose of expressing the changes in sunlight color at different times. This example can roughly illustrate the general tendency of Impressionist painters. Impressionist painting also has great shortcomings, that is, the neglect of thematic thought. At that time, someone gave Impressionism a "definition" saying: "To deal with the subject according to color tone, rather than according to the subject itself, that is what distinguishes Impressionist painters from other painters." This definition was accepted by Impressionist painters. Due to this attitude of painting "with color tone as the theme," their paintings became more and more immersed in the game of color sensation in the later period.

    At that time, the academicism directly supported by the bourgeoisie had a conservative painting style and a stale theme. The Impressionist and earlier Realist schools both expressed resistance to this painting style, but the Realist school's creative attitude was healthier than the Impressionist school, and the resistance was more powerful. Impressionist painters resisted the stale thematic thought of academicism by "not caring about thematic thought." Therefore, although they played a revolutionary role in the study of light and color, their artistic views fanned the evil wind of modern formalism schools.

    印象主义画派
    吴甲丰
    印象主义画派是十九世纪末聚集在法国巴黎的一群青年画家创始的。这群画家中最早在画坛露面的是爱德华·马内
  （E·manet）他在1863年发表的作品“草地上的午餐”中，开始显露出对于光与色的特殊兴趣。其他的画家们，受了马内的影响，开始到野外阳光下作画，进一步探求自然界光与色的变化。他们都努力用一种新方法作画，又互相研讨，互相影响。1874年，他们在巴黎第一次举办了大规模的展览，自称“无名美术家协会展览会”。那里面所陈列的，都是些面目新颖的作品，震动了当时的社会人士，其中最引人注目的画，是克劳德·莫内（C·monet）的一幅风景，画着一片朦胧的水上景色，天空中涌现出一轮光彩夺目的红日，题目叫做“印象：日出”。这幅画在当时的人看来，不但画法别致，连题目也很奇特。那时有一个批评家发表一篇评论，对这个展览会揶揄一番；这篇评论的题目袭用莫内的画题，叫做“印象主义画家展览会”。从此，“印象主义”（Impressionism）这个名称就传开了，这群画家自己也接受了它，于是就一直沿用下来，成为美术史上一个流派的名称。
    顾名思义，印象主义画家是凭借一刹那的印象作画的。但他们却不是“得了印象，回家去画出来”，正好相反，他们倒是顶喜欢携带全副画具到野外去写生，并在“现场”完成作品。在这以前，画家们一般习惯呆在画室里，依靠素描画稿作画。这两种不同的画法，就产生两种不同的画风。大体说来，较古一些的西洋画，画法比较工细，但色彩比较单纯。比方说，树叶往往是淡绿色深绿色，树干往往是淡褐色深褐色。实际上，客观世界的色彩决不是那样单纯的，印象主义的画就比较注意自然界丰富的色彩变化。按照印象主义的理论和方法，树叶不一定是单纯的绿色，树干也不一定是单纯的褐色，由于不同阳光的照射、不同的空气变化、以及树叶和树干之间色彩的互相映照，会呈现出很复杂的色彩变化。因此，细看印象主义的画，往往只见粗略的笔触和五色缤纷的色块，站在较远的地方一看，却可以看到一片真实的景色，正像我们平日在阳光下所看到的一样。
    此外，印象主义画家还注意景物的“总的印象”，那就是说，他们看景物不是局部细看，而是把景物的全部“同时观察”，这样地得到一个整体印象后，再把这“印象”比较迅速地画下来。
    总之，注重表现光与色的变化和对于景物的整体印象，是印象主义绘画的主要特征。
    光与色，是绘画中一个重要因素，是应该研究的，印象主义画家在这方面有一定的贡献。前面提到的莫内，是印象派的典型人物，他曾把同一个稻草堆作为题材画了十五幅之多，目的仅仅是为了表现不同时间内阳光色彩的变化。这一个例子，可以大体说明印象派画家的一般倾向。印象主义绘画也有很大的缺点，那就是对于主题思想的忽视。当时有人为印象主义下了一个“定义”说：“依据色调来处理主题，而不是依据主题本身，那就是印象主义画家不同于其他画家们的地方。”这个定义曾为印象派画家所接受。由于这种“以色调为主题”的作画态度，他们的画越到后期越沉湎于色彩感觉的游戏。
    当时为资产阶级所直接支持的学院主义，画风保守，主题陈腐；对于这种画风，印象派和比较早一些的写实派（现实主义）都表示反抗，但写实派的创作态度比印象派健全，反抗也就比较有力。印象派画家以“不关心主题思想”去反抗学院主义陈腐的主题思想，因此，他们虽然在光与色的研究方面起了革新作用，但他们的艺术观却又煽起了现代形式主义诸流派的邪风。
