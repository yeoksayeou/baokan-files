    "New Observer" Gets a Fresh New Look

    The thirteenth issue of "New Observer," published on July 1st, has undergone considerable innovation in both content and form. While maintaining its original characteristics of being rich in illustrations and lively and refreshing, it is richer in content and has more variety than in the past, and its literary color has also been enhanced.

    Here you will find delightful short and sharp political essays, fresh and meaningful, witty and interesting intellectual essays, essays brimming with the joy of harvest, cartoons powerfully satirizing the enemy, and sketches and watercolors depicting our new life, and so on.

    The decadence of Western bourgeois art is well known, but the emergence of someone using blood as paint is beyond imagination. This is a blatant manifestation in art of an extremely reactionary consciousness—an appreciation for cruelty. In this issue of "New Observer," in the "Political Essays and Miscellany" section, Comrade Quan Lin's article "Blood Painting" and Comrade Hua Junwu's cartoon "Vulture Eating Carrion" sharply expose and criticize this reactionary essence of Western bourgeois art.

    Pomegranate trees and oleanders are flowers and trees that people often admire; cucumbers, watermelons, pumpkins, potatoes, tomatoes, etc., are common fruits and vegetables that people often eat. Although people often see and eat these things, they may not know their origins. Comrade Xia Yan, with the keen interest of a flower-loving hobbyist, takes time off from work to consult ancient books and ask friends, seeking the origins of some plants. His article "Flowers, Trees, Fruits, and Vegetables, etc." is a record of what he has gained in this regard. The article is lively and vivid, and is a fine piece of intellectual writing.

    Comrade Wu Han's article "The Story of Hai Rui" provides a more detailed introduction to the deeds of Hai Rui, a respectable figure from the Ming Dynasty. Other pieces, such as essays, features, poems, and paintings expressing and depicting wheat harvest, new construction, and remembrance of revolutionary martyrs, are also delightful to read.

### “新观察”面目一新

    “新观察”面目一新
    7月1日出版的第十三期“新观察”，从内容到形式都有不少革新。它除仍保持原有的图文并茂、活泼清新的特点外，比过去的内容丰富了，花色品种增多了，文学色彩也加浓了。
    这里有令人喜读的短小犀利的政论，清新隽永、饶有风趣的知识小品，洋溢着丰收欢乐的散文，有力地讽刺敌人的漫画和描绘我们新生活的速写、水彩画，等等。
    西方资产阶级艺术的堕落是人所共知的，但出现有人用血作画却出人意想之外，这是极反动的意识——对于残忍的欣赏——在艺术上的露骨表现。这一期“新观察”“政论与杂文”栏里，荃麟同志的“血画”一文和华君武同志的漫画“食尸肉的秃头鹰”，尖锐地揭露和抨击了西方资产阶级艺术的这种反动本质。
    石榴树和夹竹桃是人们经常观赏的花木；黄瓜、西瓜、南瓜、洋芋、西红柿等，是人们常吃的瓜果菜蔬。这些东西，人们虽然常见常吃，但不一定都知道它们的来历。夏衍同志以一个花木爱好者的盎然兴味，在工余之暇，查古书，问朋友，寻找一些植物的源流，他的
  “花木瓜果之类”一文，便是记述他在这方面的所得的。文章生动活泼，是一篇知识小品佳作。
    吴晗同志的“海瑞的故事”一文，对明代这个令人肃然起敬的人物——海瑞的事迹，作了较详细的介绍。他如一些抒写描绘麦收、新建设和追怀先烈的散文、特写、诗、画等，也有令人喜读之作。
