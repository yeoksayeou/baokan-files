Title: Two Leadership Styles, Two Different Results: One team of cadres went deep into the fields, earnestly implementing policies, resulting in a fast and good "Double抢" (Summer Harvest and Planting); Cadres in the Fourth Team did not go deep enough, policies were not implemented, and the "Double抢" progress was slow.

According to a report in the Jiangxi Daily: In Xiaolan People's Commune, Nanchang County, Jiangxi, the first and fourth teams of Xiaolan Brigade, due to two different leadership styles, have achieved two distinctly different results in the “Double 抢” (Summer Harvest and Planting). The Party branch of the First Team worked deeply and meticulously, earnestly implementing the policy of distribution according to work and more pay for more work, giving full play to the enthusiasm of the commune members. Currently, more than half of the early rice in the team has been harvested, and more than 60 mu of fields have been planted with second-season late rice. The Party branch of the Fourth Team was limited to general calls. Especially in the implementation of the policy of distribution according to work and more pay for more work, they were not resolute or active enough. The labor enthusiasm of the masses was not fully mobilized. Currently, only 21% of the early rice has been harvested, and summer planting has just begun. Labor attendance and labor efficiency are about 15%-20% lower than that of the First Team.

This year, compared to the “Double 抢”, the conditions of the Fourth Team are better than the First Team. Each laborer in the First Team bears a task of more than 14 mu for harvesting and planting; each laborer in the Fourth Team only bears 9.4 mu of fields. Faced with the fact that the tasks of summer harvesting and planting are larger than last year, the cadres of these two teams initially showed two completely different attitudes. According to the instructions of the Commune Party Committee, the Party branch of the First Team first analyzed the favorable conditions and the arduousness of completing the task at the branch meeting, and regarded earnestly implementing the Party's policies and promoting the small-segment contracting system based on labor quotas as the main key to mobilizing the enthusiasm of commune members, improving work efficiency, and alleviating labor shortages. They went to various groups to explain the tasks to the masses, explain the policies, present the problems, and inspire the masses to find solutions. Therefore, from top to bottom, with division of labor and cooperation, a “Double 抢” movement centered on high work efficiency and high quality quickly unfolded in the entire team. The labor attendance rate increased from the original 80% to 100%, and labor efficiency increased day by day.

In terms of guiding ideology, the Fourth Team did not face the masses, but instead reached out to higher authorities for support, requesting a reduction in planting tasks. Regarding the instructions of the Brigade Party General Branch on "earnestly implementing the policy of distribution according to work and quickly promoting the small-segment contracting system based on labor quotas," at first they emphasized that it was too troublesome and there was no time, and the implementation was not resolute. Later, although it was reluctantly implemented, no ideological mobilization work was done, nor was there any discussion with the masses. Therefore, many of the regulations did not conform to reality and could not be implemented. Commune members felt that more labor could not earn more work points, labor efficiency could not be improved, 20% of the female commune members rarely attended work, and the average progress of rice cutting in the entire team was less than 0.6 mu per person per day.

Another stark contrast is that the cadres of the First Team personally participated in production, led production, and integrated leadership work closely with the mass line. The work points they earned were mostly more than those of ordinary commune members. This not only powerfully encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the commune members, but more importantly, in working with the commune members, they carried out political and ideological work in the fields, discovered problems and solved them in a timely manner, and achieved concrete leadership. Comrade Luo Shihai, the Party branch secretary, when he participated in production from the Second Group to the First Group, cut rice for two days and felt that the labor enthusiasm of some commune members in the First Group was not as high as that of the Second Group, and the work efficiency was lower than that of the Second Group. After chatting with the masses, he discovered that the rice cutting was divided into pieces with fixed quotas and paid according to fixed quotas, and the total points were averaged according to the base points of each person. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the strong laborers could not be encouraged. Luo Shihai immediately consulted with the commune members and, referring to the methods of the Second Group, changed the base points to flexible evaluation. The next day, seven of the twelve commune members who cut rice exceeded the quota. After the “Double 抢” began, the cadres of the Fourth Team rarely participated in production or led production. Comrade Luo Yushui, the team leader, was busy with administrative work all day, busy inspecting the output on the threshing ground; sometimes he participated in labor in the fields, but rarely talked with the masses. Because he did not understand the actual situation enough, the decisions he made were also very subjective. For example, the Third Group lacked plows and harrows in replanting. Without asking whether the First Group had enough plows, he asked the First Group to support them. As a result, the plows in the First Group were not sufficient, and the problem has not been solved until now, affecting the planting progress and quality of the Third Group.

Currently, the Commune Party Committee and the Brigade Party General Branch are working to help the Fourth Team improve its leadership style. At the same time, they are using the typical examples of the leadership work of these two teams to educate all cadres, learn from the experience of the leadership work of the First Team, and learn lessons from the leadership work of the Fourth Team, arm themselves, carry forward their vigor, and strive to complete the "Double 抢" task in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

### 两种领导作风　两种不同效果  一队干部深入到田间，认真执行政策，“双抢”又快又好  四队干部作风不深入，政策没有落实，“双抢”进度迟缓

    两种领导作风　两种不同效果
    一队干部深入到田间，认真执行政策，“双抢”又快又好
    四队干部作风不深入，政策没有落实，“双抢”进度迟缓
    据江西日报消息　江西南昌县小蓝人民公社小蓝大队的第一和第四小队，在“双抢”中，由于两种不同的领导作风，带来了两种显明不同的效果。一小队党支部工作深入细致，认真贯彻执行了按劳分配、多劳多得的政策，充分发挥了社员的积极性，目前全队的早稻已收割了一半多，还有六十多亩田插上了二季晚稻。第四小队的党支部限于一般的号召，特别是在贯彻执行按劳分配、多劳多得的政策上，不够坚决、不够积极，群众的劳动积极性没有充分调动起来，目前早稻收割才完成了21％，夏种刚刚开始，劳动出勤和劳动效率与一小队比较，大约低15％—20％。
    今年“双抢”中，这两个队比较起来，四队要比一队条件好一些。第一小队每个劳动力负担的收、种任务，有十四亩多；第四小队每个劳动力只负担九亩四分田。面对夏收夏种任务都较去年大的事实，这两个队的干部，一开始就表现了两种截然不同的态度。一队的党支部根据公社党委的指示，首先在支部会上分析了有利条件和完成任务的艰巨性，把认真贯彻执行党的政策，推行劳动定额小段包工制，作为调动社员的劳动积极性、提高工作效率和缓和劳动力紧张的主要关键。他们分头深入各组向群众交任务，交政策，摆问题，启发群众找办法。于是，从上到下，分工合作，一个以高工效、高质量为中心的
  “双抢”运动，迅速在全队开展起来，劳动出勤率由原来的80％提高到百分之百，劳动效率日益上升。
    第四小队在指导思想上，不是面向群众，而是伸手向上级要支援，请求减少种植任务。对于大队党总支关于“认真执行按劳分配的政策，迅速推行劳动定额小段包工制”的指示，起初是强调太麻烦，时间来不及，执行不坚决；后来虽然勉强推行了，既没有做思想动员工作，也没有和群众研究商量，因而其中许多规定不符合实际，推行不下去。社员感到多劳不能多得工分，劳动效率提不高，有20％的女社员很少出勤，全队割禾进度每天每人平均达不到六分田。
    另一个鲜明的对照，是一小队的干部，亲自参加生产，领导生产，把领导工作紧紧地和群众路线融成一体。他们做的工分，大部分都比一般社员多。这不仅有力地鼓舞了社员的劳动热情，更重要的是他们在和社员一起劳动中，把政治思想工作做到了田头，及时发现问题及时解决，实现了具体的领导。支部书记罗时海同志，从第二组到第一组参加生产时，割了二天禾，感到一组部分社员劳动情绪没有二组高，工效比二组低；经和群众漫谈，发现原来割禾是分片定工、定额计酬，总分按每人底分平均分摊，因此劳动强的社员劲头鼓不起来。罗时海当即和社员们商量后，参照二组的办法，改为底分活评，次日十二个社员割禾，有七个都突破了定额。第四队的干部在“双抢”开始后，很少参加生产、领导生产。小队长罗玉水同志整日忙于事务工作，忙于在禾场上验收产量；有时到田间参加劳动，也很少和群众谈谈心。由于对实际情况了解不够，作出的决定也很主观。如第三组复种中缺少犁耙，他不问第一组犁够用不够用，就要一组去支援，结果一组犁也不宽裕，直到现在还没有解决，影响了三组的插秧进度和质量。
    目前，公社党委和大队党总支正着手帮助四小队改进领导作风。同时运用这两个队领导工作的典型事例，教育所有干部，从一小队的领导工作中吸取经验，从四小队领导工作中接受教训，武装自己，发扬干劲，力争多快好省的完成“双抢”任务。
