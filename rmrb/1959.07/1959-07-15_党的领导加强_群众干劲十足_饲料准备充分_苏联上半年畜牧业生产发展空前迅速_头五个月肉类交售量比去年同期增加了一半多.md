Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th (By our reporter Dai Feng) - The Central Statistical Bureau of the Soviet Council of Ministers recently issued a communique announcing that the Soviet Union has completed its procurement plan for livestock products for the first half of this year. The communique stated that meat procurement completed 135% of the plan, with procurement volume increasing by 46% compared to the same period last year; milk and wool completed 108%, increasing by 20% compared to the same period last year; and eggs completed 116%, increasing by 31% compared to the same period last year.

In recent years, the Soviet Union's livestock production has seen a surge, but judging from the huge achievements announced in the communique, the speed of development of Soviet livestock production in the first half of this year was unprecedented. According to statistics, in the first five months of this year, the number of cattle increased by 6.7 million head, and the number of pigs increased by 5.5 million head. In comparison, during the three years from October 1953 to October 1956, the number of cattle in the entire Soviet Union only increased by 7.4 million head, and the number of pigs increased by 8.9 million head. It is not difficult to see that the rate of increase in these two types of livestock in the first half of this year was several times greater than in those years. The significant increase in the number of livestock has created a solid foundation for increasing livestock products, and the over-fulfillment of the state procurement plan in the first half of this year is closely related to the increase in the number of livestock.

Among the various livestock products in the first half of this year, meat production increased particularly rapidly, a speed unimaginable in the capitalist world. According to statistics, in the first five months of this year, collective farms and state farms sold 54% more meat (live weight) to the state than in the same period last year. In contrast, all capitalist countries in the world only increased meat production by 45% in twenty-four years (1934-1957). As for the United States, its average annual increase rate in meat production is only 1.3%.

The completion of livestock production plans in many republics of the Soviet Union in the first half of this year was very good. Belarus, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Moldova, Georgia, and other republics have all overfulfilled their livestock production plans for the first half of this year one month or twenty days ahead of schedule.

In terms of livestock product production, the Russian Federation, which plays a pivotal role, increased meat production by 45%, milk by 21%, eggs by 33%, and wool by 25% in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. Kazakhstan overfulfilled its half-year plan for meat production by 117.8% and one month ahead of schedule, and sold 2.7 times more meat to the state than in the same period last year. Ukraine, Belarus, and the three Baltic republics—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—also increased meat production by about 40% and milk production by about 30%, respectively.

The reasons for the unprecedented rapid development of livestock production in the first half of this year are: Party organizations throughout the Soviet Union have strengthened their leadership over livestock production and strengthened political and ideological work in competitions, thereby inspiring the labor enthusiasm and political zeal of the masses; the widespread bumper harvests of crops in the Soviet Union last year provided a reliable feed base for the development of livestock production. According to statistics, 150 million tons of silage were stored last year alone. This year, various republics have also generally expanded the planting area of high-yield feed—corn; thanks to the promotion of advanced artificial insemination, livestock breeding has also improved to a certain extent. During this period, in addition to breeding cattle, pigs, and sheep, chickens, ducks, and rabbits were also bred in large numbers. This has expanded the sources of livestock products in many ways; at the same time, many new livestock feeding and management methods have been implemented, thus accelerating the growth rate of livestock.

The good situation of all parts of the Soviet Union completing the livestock production plan for the first half of this year marks that Soviet agricultural workers have already fought a beautiful victory on the livestock production front in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan. Now, Soviet agricultural workers are making persistent efforts to strive for the early completion of the full-year production plan. (Attached pictures)

### 党的领导加强　群众干劲十足　饲料准备充分  苏联上半年畜牧业生产发展空前迅速  头五个月肉类交售量比去年同期增加了一半多

    党的领导加强　群众干劲十足　饲料准备充分
    苏联上半年畜牧业生产发展空前迅速
    头五个月肉类交售量比去年同期增加了一半多
    新华社莫斯科14日电　本社记者戴枫报道：苏联部长会议中央统计局最近发表公报宣布：苏联完成了今年前半年畜产品收购计划。公报说，肉类收购完成了计划的135％，收购量比去年同一时期增加了46％，牛奶和羊毛完成了108％，比去年同一时期增加了20％，蛋类完成了116％，比去年同一时期增加了31％。
    最近几年来，苏联畜牧业生产出现了高涨的局面，但是从公报发表的这些巨大成绩看来，这半年，苏联畜牧业生产发展的速度之快更是空前的。据统计，今年头五个月，牛的头数增加了六百七十万头，猪增加了五百五十万头。而在1953年10月到1956年10月这三年期间，全苏联牛的头数才增加了七百四十万头，猪增加了八百九十万头。不难看出，今年上半年这两种牲畜增加速度和那几年相比要大好几倍了。牲畜头数的显著增加，为增加畜产品创造了巩固的基础，今年前半年国家收购计划的超额完成是和牲畜头数增加密切联系着的。
    在今年前半年，各种畜产品之中尤以肉类增产的速度为快，这一速度是资本主义世界不可想像的。据统计，今年头五个月，集体农庄和国营农场交售给国家的肉类（活重）比去年同一时期增加了54％。而世界上所有资本主义国家在二十四年（1934—1957）内肉类产量才提高了45％，至于美国，它的肉类产量的平均年增加率只是1.3％。
    苏联的许多共和国今年前半年畜牧业生产计划完成的情况非常良好，白俄罗斯、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚、乌克兰、俄罗斯联邦、哈萨克、塔吉克、摩尔达维亚、格鲁吉亚等共和国都先后提前一个月或二十天超额完成了今年上半年的畜牧业生产计划。
    在畜产品生产方面，举足轻重的俄罗斯联邦上半年肉类生产比去年同一时期增加了45％，牛奶增加了21％，蛋类增加了33％，羊毛增加了25％。哈萨克的肉类生产以117.8％超额和提前一个月完成了半年计划，交售给国家的肉类比去年同一时期增加了二点七倍。乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波罗的海沿岸的三个共和国——爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚、立陶宛等也都分别增产肉类40％左右、奶类30％左右。
    今年前半年畜牧业空前迅速发展的原因是：全苏各地党组织加强了对畜牧业生产的领导，加强了竞赛中的政治思想工作，从而鼓舞了群众的劳动干劲和政治热情；苏联去年农作物普遍大丰收，为发展畜牧业提供了可靠的饲料基础。据统计，去年一年储存的青贮饲料达一亿五千万吨。今年各共和国又普遍扩大了高产饲料——玉蜀黍的播种面积；由于推广先进的人工受精，繁殖牲畜也有了一定改善。这期间除了繁殖牛、猪、羊之外，而且大量繁殖了鸡、鸭和兔子。这就多方面地扩大了畜产品来源；同时实行了许多新的牲畜喂养管理方法，因而牲畜的成长速度在加快。
    苏联全国各地完成今年前半年畜牧业生产计划的良好情况，标志着苏联农业劳动者在七年计划第一年的畜牧业生产战线上已经打了一次漂亮的胜仗。现在，苏联农业劳动者正在再接再厉为争取提前完成今年全年生产计划而奋斗。（附图片）
