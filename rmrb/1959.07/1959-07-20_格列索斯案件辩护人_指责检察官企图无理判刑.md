Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 18th: The Athens Military Tribunal heard statements from the defense lawyers on the 18th.

Glezos's defense lawyer, Mandilaras, pointed out that the accusation of so-called "espionage" was so brazen that its fabricators did not even bother to specify the time, place, and content of the espionage, nor did they identify which foreign country was being spied for.

The defense lawyer sternly refuted the lie that Koliagiannis supposedly met with Glezos at the Dolianitis' home; yet this very morning, the prosecutor demanded Glezos's conviction based on this charge. The defense lawyer accused the prosecutor of lacking basic respect for the testimony of the defendant's witnesses who refuted the above-mentioned meeting. He pointed out that the police officers' testimonies regarding this meeting were full of contradictions. The various versions presented in court regarding this fabricated meeting between Koliagiannis and Glezos proved that the myth surrounding this meeting was entirely concocted by the political police.

Defense lawyer Mangakis then spoke. He protested the prosecutor's reliance on the false testimony of the Dolianitis couple as a basis for demanding Glezos's sentencing. He pointed out that these false testimonies were given under the violent coercion of the political police, and moreover, they had subsequently declared their withdrawal of these testimonies.

    格列索斯案件辩护人
    指责检察官企图无理判刑
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社雅典18日讯：雅典军事法庭18日听取了辩护人的发言。
    格列索斯的辩护人曼迪拉腊斯指出，对所谓“间谍活动”的诬告是如此放肆，以致它的编造者甚至没顾到说出有关间谍活动的时间、地点和内容，也指不出究竟是替哪个外国进行间谍活动。
    辩护人严词驳斥了关于科里雅尼斯似乎曾经在多利亚尼提斯夫妇家里同格列索斯会面的谎话；而这天早晨检察官却正是根据这个罪名要求对格列索斯判罪的。辩护人指责检察官对被告证人推翻上述会见的事实的证词缺乏起码的尊重。他指出，在警官们关于这次会见所提出的证词中矛盾百出。在法庭上关于这次凭空臆造出来的科里雅尼斯同格列索斯会见提出了各种不同的说法，这就证明，关于这次会见的神话全是政治警察们编造出来的。
    辩护人曼加基斯接着发言。他抗议检察官用多利亚尼提斯夫妇的假证词作为要求对格列索斯判刑的根据。他指出，这些假证词是在政治警察的暴力逼迫下说出来的，况且他们事后已经声明撤回自己的这些证词。
