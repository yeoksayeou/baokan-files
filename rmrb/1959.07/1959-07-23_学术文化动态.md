Czechoslovak Economists Discuss Commodity Production Under Socialism

A discussion on commodity production under socialism has become a topic of interest for Czechoslovak economists. The Czechoslovak magazine "Planned Economy" recently discussed this issue and published articles by five economists. During the discussion, everyone agreed that commodity production and exchange still exist under socialism, and the law of value still plays a role. However, there were two different opinions regarding the reasons for the existence of commodity production and the scope of commodity exchange: one group believed that the products exchanged between state-owned enterprises are not commodities; the other group believed that the products exchanged between state-owned enterprises are also commodities.

Those holding the first view believe that the main reason for the existence of commodity production is "the existence of different ownership systems." Under socialism, there still exist ownership by the whole people and collective ownership. Therefore, socialist social production still has the nature of commodity production. However, since members of collective ownership are also owners of the wealth of ownership by the whole people, socialist commodity production has characteristics different from commodity production in any previous period.

However, they believe that not all commodities enter the realm of commodity circulation under socialism. Therefore, although the production of some products is commodity production, these products are not commodities. For this reason, the exchange of products between state-owned enterprises is not commodity exchange, because the exchange of products between state-owned enterprises does not change the nature of product ownership. It still belongs to the ownership by the whole people. This is the transfer of products between enterprises of the same ownership, which does not enter the realm of commodity circulation and is not affected by the law of supply and demand.

They also believe that although these products are not commodities, they still have the nature of commodity production. Because the products exchanged between state-owned enterprises will be used as means of production for producing commodities, and the value of costs must be calculated.

They also believe that after the two different ownership systems under socialism are transformed into a single system of ownership by the whole people, the conditions for the existence of commodity production will disappear.

Those holding the second view believe that the reason for the existence of commodity production under socialism is not only due to the existence of two forms of ownership, but also because the ownership by the whole people itself contains factors for the existence of commodity production. This is because the level of social production is not high enough, social production cannot be completely centralized, and each state-owned enterprise must be given a certain "economic independence." This independence means that although each state-owned enterprise is not the owner of the means of production, it is actually the possessor of the means of production of its own enterprise. They can control these means of production. Because of this, commodity relations also occur between state-owned enterprises, constituting the reason for the existence of commodity production. Therefore, they believe that the exchange of products between state-owned enterprises is also commodity exchange, because the exchange of products between enterprises is an exchange of equal value. Although the product does not change ownership, the "right of possession" is transferred, so these products are also commodities. They believe that commodity production will still exist after the entire socialist economy is transformed into ownership by the whole people, and the conditions for the existence of commodity production will disappear only when the productive forces are highly developed and the "economic independence" of enterprises is no longer necessary.

Those holding this view also believe that the argument that the products exchanged between socialist state-owned enterprises are not commodities will have a negative impact on economic work, causing economic workers to ignore economic accounting and not pay attention to the issues of cost and price.

Polish Economists' Research Work

The research work of the Economic Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences currently focuses on the following three aspects: 1. Important issues related to socialist political economics and the Polish national economy; 2. Issues related to capitalist political economics and the economies of modern capitalist countries; 3. The history of Polish economic thought, critically studying modern bourgeois economic theories.

The attention of the staff of the Polish Economic Institute is focused on the main problems and the most pressing theoretical problems of Polish economic development. They strive to summarize the scientific conclusions already drawn in various monographs and use these conclusions for further research.

The writings of the Institute's staff are published in economic journals ("Economist," etc.) and the "Economic Institute Writings" bulletin. In 1958, the Economic Institute also held two scientific conferences, one discussing the issues of prices and costs in the socialist national economy, and the other discussing the main aspects and indicators of the Polish national economic plan from 1961 to 1975.

The Polish Economic Institute closely integrates scientific research work with current economic tasks and the most pressing economic policy issues. They study many issues, mainly: 1. The economic effects of investment and technological progress. 2. The issues of prices and costs in the socialist national economy. This is a central issue because it affects various sectors of the national economy to some extent. The view on this issue is clear, that is, price formation in the socialist economy should be based on the average cost of the product, not the highest cost of the product. 3. The issue of labor productivity. The Polish Economic Institute has studied the issue of labor productivity for several years, striving to illustrate how much potential there is for the growth of industrial production by analyzing and comparing materials from Poland and other countries. 4. The issue of socialist expanded reproduction. The theory of expanded reproduction also includes the issue of the balance sheet of the national economy. 5. The issue of supply and demand. In addition to the effective demand indicators, the demand coefficient calculated by the Institute is also used in economic practice. The Institute scientifically analyzes the demand and consumption of industrial products and food based on the study of the budgets of worker, peasant, and staff families. This work is of great significance for determining urban and rural economic policies. 6. Studying the long-term plan for Poland's development of the national economy from 1961 to 1975 and the draft five-year plan from 1961 to 1965. 7. Some issues related to the structure of modern capitalism, etc.

The staff of the Economic Institute also systematically study wage issues, the development history of progressive economic thought in Poland in the 19th century, and so on.

    捷经济学家讨论社会主义制度下的商品生产问题
    关于社会主义制度下商品生产问题的讨论已成为捷克斯洛伐克经济学家们感到兴趣的一个问题。捷克斯洛伐克“计划经济”杂志不久前对这一问题进行了讨论，并发表了五位经济学家的文章。在讨论中，大家对在社会主义制度下仍然存在商品生产和商品交换以及价值法则仍然起着作用的看法是一致的，但在对商品生产存在的原因和商品交换的范围的看法上却存在两种不同的意见：一派认为国营企业间交换的产品不是商品；一派认为国营企业间交换的产品也是商品。
    持第一种意见的人认为，商品生产存在的原因主要是“不同的所有制的存在”，在社会主义制度下还存在着全民所有制和集体所有制，因此社会主义的社会生产仍带有商品生产的性质，不过由于集体所有制的成员同时也是全民所有制的财富的所有者，因此社会主义的商品生产具有不同于以往任何时期商品生产的特点。
    但是他们认为，在社会主义制度下不是所有的商品都进入商品流通的领域的，因此有一部分产品的生产虽然是商品生产，但这些产品都不是商品。为此，国营企业间的产品交换就不是商品交换，因为国营企业间相互交换的产品，并没有改变产品所有制的性质，它仍然是属于全民所有，这是同一所有制各企业间产品的调拨，它不进入商品流通的领域，也不受供求律的影响。
    他们也认为，这些产品虽然不是商品，但仍然具有商品生产的性质。因为，国营企业互相交换的产品将要用来作为生产商品的生产手段，要计算成本的价值。
    他们并认为在社会主义制度下两种不同的所有制变为一个全民所有制后，商品生产存在的条件也就消失了。
    持第二种意见的人认为：社会主义制度下商品生产存在的原因不仅由于存在两种所有制形式，而是由于全民所有制本身就包含有商品生产存在的因素。这是因为社会的生产水平还不够高，社会生产不能完全集中，必须赋予各个国营企业一定的“经济独立性”，这种独立性意味着各国营企业虽不是生产资料的所有者，但实际上是本企业生产资料的占有者。可以支配这些生产资料，由于这样国营企业之间也发生商品关系，并构成商品生产存在的原因，因此他们认为国营企业之间的产品交换也是商品交换，因为企业间的产品交换是等价交换，产品虽然不易所有权，但
  “占有权”转移了，所以这些产品也是商品。他们认为，社会主义经济全部转变成全民所有制后，商品生产仍会存在，要到生产力高度发达，使企业的“经济独立性”没有必要再存在时，商品生产存在的条件才会消失。
    持这种意见的人并认为，说社会主义国营企业间交换的产品不是商品，这种论断会对经济工作产生不良影响，使经济工作人员忽视经济核算，不注意成本、价格的问题。　（杨翊）
      波兰经济学家的研究工作
    波兰科学院经济研究所研究工作目前着重下列三个方面：一、有关社会主义政治经济学和波兰国民经济的重要问题；二、有关资本主义政治经济学和现代资本主义国家经济的一些问题；三、波兰经济思想史，批判地研究现代资产阶级经济理论。
    波兰经济研究所工作人员的注意力集中在波兰经济发展的主要问题和最迫切的理论问题上。他们力求总结各种专著中已经得出的科学结论，利用这些结论进一步研究。
    研究所工作人员的著作发表在经济刊物（“经济学者”等）和“经济研究所著作”通报上。1958年经济研究所还召开了两个科学会议，一个会议讨论了社会主义国民经济中的价格和成本问题，另一个会议讨论了1961至1975年波兰国民经济计划的主要方面和指标。
    波兰经济研究所把科学研究工作同当前经济任务以及最迫切的经济政策问题紧密结合起来。他们研究的问题很多，主要有：一、投资和技术进步的经济效果问题。二、社会主义国民经济中的价格和成本问题。这是一个中心问题，因为它在某种程度上涉及到国民经济各个部门。在这个问题上的观点是明确的，即在社会主义经济中价格形成应该依据产品平均成本，而不是依据产品最高成本。三、劳动生产率问题。波兰经济研究所在几年内研究了劳动生产率问题，力求通过分析和比较波兰与其他国家的材料来说明工业生产的增长有多么大的潜力。四、社会主义扩大再生产问题。在扩大再生产的理论方面，也包括国民经济平衡表问题。五、供求关系问题。除了需求有效性指标外，在经济实践中还采用研究所计算的需求系数。研究所根据对工人、农民、职员家庭预算的研究，科学地分析了工业品和食品的需求和消费。这个工作对于决定城乡经济政策有很大意义。六、研究1961—1975年波兰发展国民经济的长期计划以及1961—1965年五年计划草案问题。七、同现代资本主义的结构等有关的一些问题。
    经济研究所的工作人员还有系统地研究工资问题，研究十九世纪波兰进步经济思想发展史，等等。
