The characteristic of electricity production is fast transmission and inability to be stored. The electricity generated by power plants is delivered instantly to factories to start machines, and to homes and shops to light up electric lights. The power plant generates as much electricity as users need; if users don't use electricity, the power plant cannot generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated by the generator at every moment depends on how much electricity the user needs.

However, there are many users of electricity, including factories, mines, government agencies, schools, shops, households, as well as transportation, telecommunications departments, farmland irrigation, etc., covering a wide range. The amount and timing of electricity consumption vary among different types of users and are also affected by seasons, climate, and other factors. These create difficulties for electricity production. When many users concentrate on using electricity at the same time, the power plant has to start all the generators, and the power supply is often very tight, and may not even be able to meet the needs. This is called peak load. When many users concentrate on not using electricity at the same time, the power plant has to shut down some generators, and the capacity of the power equipment cannot be fully utilized, resulting in waste. This is called valley load. In order to solve this unreasonable electricity consumption phenomenon, the electricity department must rationally organize and arrange the electricity consumption time of various types of users according to their electricity consumption patterns, cut the "peaks" and fill the "valleys", so that the power load of the power plant tends to be stable every day and every hour. This is called adjusting the electrical load.

There are many ways to adjust the electrical load, which should be determined according to the characteristics of electricity consumption in each region. For example, in areas with general factories and enterprises, methods such as staggering the working hours of factories and enterprises, adjusting production shifts, rotating weekly rest, and arranging flexible loads and late-night electricity consumption according to production tasks can be used. In this way, after the electrical load of the power plant tends to be stable every day and every hour, production can be organized in a balanced manner.

Adjusting the electrical load can not only fully utilize the potential of power supply and use equipment but also plays an important role in ensuring safe power supply and can also play a significant role in regulating urban life. For example, when factories and enterprises take turns to have weekly rest, urban transportation, entertainment venues, and service industries can avoid congestion.

    为什么要调整电力负荷？
    电力生产的特点是输送快，不能储存。发电厂发出的电一瞬间就送到工厂使机器开动起来，送到家庭、商店使电灯燃亮。用户用多少电，发电机才能发多少电；用户不用电，发电机就不能发电。发电机每时每刻发多少电，都要决定于用户需要多少电。
    但是，使用电力的用户很多，有工厂、矿山、机关、学校、商店、家庭，还有交通、电讯部门、农田灌溉等，范围很广，各类用户用电多少和用电时间不一样，并且还受季节、气候等影响。这些都给电力生产造成困难。当许多用户集中在一个时间用电时，发电厂就要把所有发电机都发动起来，电力供应往往很紧张，甚至还不能满足需要，这就叫作高峰负荷；当许多用户都集中在一个时间不用电时，发电厂就得把部分发电机停下来，发电设备能力不能充分发挥，形成浪费，这就叫作低谷负荷。为了解决这种用电不合理的现象，电力部门就要根据各类用户的用电规律，合理地组织与安排他们的用电时间，削平“高峰”，填满“低谷”，使发电厂每天每时的电力负荷趋于平稳，这就叫作调整电力负荷。
    调整电力负荷的方法很多，要根据各地区用电的特点来决定。如在一般有工厂企业的地区，就用错开各工厂企业的上下班时间，调整生产班次，轮流周休，以及根据生产任务安排机动负荷和深夜用电等等办法。这样，发电厂每天每时的电力负荷趋于平稳后，就可以均衡组织生产了。
    调整电力负荷不仅能充分发挥供用电设备潜力，对保证安全供电也有重要的作用，并且对城市生活也能起很大的调剂作用。如工厂企业轮流周休，城市交通、文娱场所、服务性行业就可以避免拥挤。
