Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 20th - Hubei Province's many People's Communes are actively doing a good job in preventing heatstroke in the fields, allowing commune members to happily welcome the "Double 抢" (搶 qiǎng: seize, rush, grab) battle (搶割早稻 qiǎng gē zǎodào: rush to harvest early rice and 搶插晚稻 qiǎng chā wǎndào: rush to plant late rice).

Currently, in many commune fields, there is a grass shelter every so often. The grass shelters are equipped with hot tea and also cold salted boiled water. Commune members working in the fields can go to these grass shelters to find shade and rest. Some commune members in Echeng, Hanyang, Macheng, and other counties, seeing that there are many field shelters this year and that tea and water are supplied in a timely manner, are very satisfied, saying, "The commune is really thoughtful, shelters are set up in the middle of the fields, hot tea and cold water are sufficiently prepared, working one day is as good as working two days." Many communes have also rationally adjusted working hours and tasks to adapt to the hot summer weather. The specific methods are: start work early, finish work late, and take a three-hour lunch break at noon. Do heavy and hot work in the early morning and late evening, or take turns working in shifts. In order to prevent commune members from suffering heatstroke and getting sick, medical personnel from many communes often go deep into the fields for diagnosis and treatment during this period. For example, thirty-two medical personnel from the Huarong Commune in Echeng County recently organized twelve medical teams, going wherever there are patients to provide treatment. Some communes also pay attention to the diet of commune members. Chongyang County has inspected more than 2,500 canteens throughout the county and made arrangements for living during the "Double 抢" period. Some communes in Puji and Echeng counties have also specially arranged for people to catch fish to diversify the food. Some canteens make green bean soup, tomato soup, and vegetable soup every day to relieve the heat for commune members.

"Double 抢" is the busiest season in the South and coincides with the hottest summer weather. Therefore, many communes have attached great importance to the work of preventing heatstroke in the fields during the "Double 抢" period from the beginning. In order to strengthen leadership over this work, some communes have established heatstroke prevention command organizations from the commune to the team, and some communes have also held cadre meetings and mass meetings at the production team level, using loudspeakers and big-character posters to widely publicize heatstroke prevention knowledge.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 19th - Shidong Commune in Luxian County, Sichuan, comprehensively arranges the lives of commune members, ensuring that they eat well and rest well, and energetically engage in the busy work of rushing to harvest early rice and rushing to plant late rice.

The early rice planted by the Shidong Commune this year is densely planted, grows well, and matures later than in previous years, so the amount of labor required for rushing to harvest and rush to plant is large and more concentrated. In response to this situation, the commune Party committee pays close attention to arranging the lives of commune members. First, vigorously improve the canteen work to ensure that commune members eat their fill and eat well. According to the principle of eating more during busy farming seasons and saving during slack seasons, each production team has rationally adjusted the food plan for commune members. The cooks have designed various ways to increase the variety of dishes, making the rice fragrant and the dishes fresh, which the commune members love to eat. All canteens have generally added tea barrels, using 黄荆子 huángjīngzǐ (Vitex negundo) and 痱子草 fèizicǎo (a kind of grass used to treat heat rash) to boil cool drinks; hot water is boiled at night for commune members to wash their feet and bathe. Secondly, ensure that commune members get good rest and combine work with rest. Because it is extremely hot at noon, this commune implements the method of going to work early and finishing work late, taking advantage of the coolness of the early morning and late evening to do more work, and extending the lunch break. The whole commune has also organized more than 130 commercial personnel to deliver goods to the fields. More than forty health personnel also go to the fields to publicize, see patients, and participate in production. Each production team has prepared anti-heatstroke medicines such as 仁丹 réndān (a kind of Chinese medicine used to treat heatstroke) and emergency medicine.

The commune's organizations at all levels have designated special personnel to be responsible for the lives of commune members, and all cadres in the commune are very concerned about the lives of commune members. Since the "Double 抢" period, the attendance rate has remained above 98%.

    作好“双抢”期防暑工作
    湖北许多田间搭凉棚，供应清凉饮料
    四川石洞公社延长午休时间，社员精力更加充沛
    本报汉口20日电　湖北省许多人民公社积极作好田间防暑工作，使社员们高高兴兴地迎接“双抢”（抢割早稻和抢插晚稻）战斗。
    目前，有不少公社的田野里，隔不多远就有一个草棚。草棚里备有热茶，也有冷盐开水。社员们在田间劳动可以到这些草棚里蔽阴歇凉。鄂城、汉阳、麻城等县有些公社的社员，看到今年田间凉棚多，茶水供应及时，非常满意，都说：“公社办事真周全，凉棚搭在畈中间，热茶凉水办得足，一天做活顶两天”。不少公社又合理地调整了劳动时间和活路，以适应伏暑高温。具体办法是：早上工、晚收工，中午吃饭休息三点钟。重活、热活早晚作，或者采取换班的办法轮流作。为了防止社员中暑生病，许多公社的医务人员在这期间经常深入田间诊治。例如，鄂城县华容公社三十二个医务人员，最近就组织了十二个医疗小组，哪里有病人就到哪里治疗。有些公社对社员的饮食也很注意。崇阳县已对全县两千五百多个食堂进行了检查，安排了
  “双抢”期间的生活。蒲圻、鄂城等县有些公社还专门安排有人捕鱼，做到饭菜多样化。有的食堂每天做些绿豆汤、蕃茄汤、青菜汤，为社员解暑。
      “双抢”是南方最繁忙的季节，而又适值天气最炎热的伏暑。因此，许多公社一开始就很重视“双抢”期间的田间防暑工作。为了加强对这一工作的领导，有些公社从社到队都建立了防暑指挥机构，有的公社还以生产队为单位召开了干部会、群众会，利用广播筒、大字报，对防暑常识进行了广泛宣传。

    据新华社成都19日电　四川泸县石洞公社全面安排社员生活，使社员们吃得好休息得好，精力充沛地投入抢收早稻抢插晚稻大忙。
    石洞公社今年早稻栽的密，长的好，成熟期比往年迟，因而抢收抢插的农活劳动量大，而且更加集中。公社党委针对这种情况，十分注意安排好社员的生活。首先，大力改进食堂工作，保证社员吃饱吃好。根据农忙多吃、农闲节省的原则，各生产队都合理地调整了社员吃粮计划。炊事员们多方设计增加饭菜花样，作得饭香菜鲜，社员爱吃。各食堂普遍增设了茶桶，用黄荆子、痱子草等煮了清凉饮料；晚上烧热水，供社员洗脚洗澡。其次，保证社员休息好，做到劳逸结合。由于中午暴热，这个公社实行了早出工、晚收工的办法，利用早晚凉爽时多做活，午休时间延长。全社还组织了一百三十多个商业人员，送货到田边。四十多个卫生人员也到田间边宣传、边看病、边参加生产。各生产小队都自备了人丹、救急药水等防暑药品。
    公社的各级组织都确定有专人负责管社员的生活，全社干部对社员生活都很关心。从“双抢”以来，出勤率一直保持在98％以上。
