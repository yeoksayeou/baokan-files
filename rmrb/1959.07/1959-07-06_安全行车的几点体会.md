Several Experiences in Safe Driving
Liang Zuoping, Secretary of the General Branch of the CPC Beijing Transportation Company Qinghe Motor Vehicle Depot

Our Qinghe Motor Vehicle Depot has not had any casualties for three years. During this period, all 127 vehicles and 143 trailers in the depot have safely traveled more than 13.26 million kilometers. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year, we overfulfilled the transportation plan by 25% from January to May this year, an increase of 81% compared with the same period last year; saved more than 66,000 liters of gasoline; and now the vehicle integrity rate has reached 99.21%, and the trailer integrity rate has reached 97.74%; the transportation cost has been reduced by 36.21%. Forty-four vehicles in the depot have achieved or exceeded the output target of the "Safety, Economy, 10,000 Ton-Kilometers per Ton-Month" campaign (according to regulations, the urban short-distance transportation vehicle ton-month output is 8,000 ton-kilometers). We have the following experiences in our work.

Increasing Production and Practicing Economy and Safe Transportation Can Achieve Double Harvests

In the past, when our depot's employees completed transportation tasks, practiced economy, and ensured safe transportation, they sometimes focused on one aspect and neglected the others, failing to achieve a double harvest of increasing production and practicing economy and safe transportation. During the rectification campaign, after extensive airing of views, big debates, and thorough discussions, this issue was studied more thoroughly. Through specific analysis, all employees in the depot realized that many measures to increase production and practice economy, such as improving driving skills, improving the technical condition of vehicles, and improving road conditions, are also good ways to ensure safe production. In terms of motor vehicle transportation work, increasing production and practicing economy and safe transportation are unified. Some specific practices, such as speeding up driving, carrying more trailers, and increasing night shifts, also have factors that are not conducive to safety and may affect driving safety. Our depot has taken all effective measures to actively promote methods that can both achieve increased production and economy and ensure safe transportation. For those experiences that are conducive to increasing production and economy but are to some extent unfavorable to safe transportation, we have adopted the method of combining leading cadres, workers, and technicians to study effective preventive measures to eliminate factors that are unfavorable to safety. For example, promoting motor vehicle trailer transportation has a certain impact on safety, so we actively improve the manufacturing quality of trailers, pay attention to regular maintenance and reinforcement to ensure the integrity of trailers, and avoid accidents caused by trailer failures; at the same time, we study which routes, which sites, which vehicles, and which drivers are suitable for carrying trailers, and how many trailers are the most economical and safe. We specifically apply the experience of trailer transportation according to the conditions of time and place. Now our depot basically achieves one vehicle with two trailers except for coal trucks. Since the promotion of motor vehicle trailer transportation, no accidents have occurred. In terms of speeding up vehicle turnover, some people initially only considered speeding up driving speed, and therefore felt that it contradicted safe driving. Later, the leaders and the employees analyzed the various links related to driving speed together, and believed that as long as work is done well in all aspects, the above-mentioned defects can be avoided. For example, shortening the loading and unloading time of vehicles, cooperating well with the freight units, simplifying procedures, improving scheduling work, improving mileage utilization, reducing empty running of vehicles, improving on-site road conditions, etc., can effectively reduce vehicle waiting time, improve transportation efficiency, and speed up vehicle turnover. Through the discussion of these issues, everyone gradually understood the correct relationship between increasing production and practicing economy and safe transportation, and found a way to deal with the contradictions between the two. All employees are full of confidence in safe transportation.

Improve Management System and Improve Workers' Skills

Since the rectification campaign, we have relied on the masses to continuously improve the enterprise management system. In terms of ensuring safe transportation, we have established the following systems.

First, according to the characteristics of motor vehicle transportation, we have established a system of "pre-departure speeches" every day, a "safety activity day" once a week, and large-scale safety activities before festivals. In view of the fact that some systems established in the past tended to be mere formalities, this time, every time a system is established, we earnestly mobilize the masses to discuss it, so that the system is practical and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The safety speech before departure is carried out by the squad leader, mainly focusing on the day's transportation tasks and putting forward precautions based on weather, road conditions, and other factors. On the weekly safety activity day, meetings are held to check the safety production situation of the week, exchange safe driving experiences, expose accident seedlings, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. The safety activities before the festivals mainly aim at the dense pedestrians and vehicles on the streets during the festivals and the complicated traffic conditions, reminding drivers to pay special attention and formulating effective measures to prevent accidents. Because we pay attention to the content of various activities to be combined with reality and the form should be lively and lively, the workers feel that the safety activity day and the pre-departure speech are helpful to the work, and they actively participate.

Second, tighten the inspection of the technical condition of vehicles entering and leaving the depot. In order to avoid traffic accidents caused by vehicle parts failures, our depot has set up safety inspectors who carefully inspect the technical condition of the vehicles every day before departure. If a part failure is found, it will be repaired immediately, and then the vehicle will be dispatched after the repair is completed; a thorough inspection is also carried out when the vehicle is received, and if a fault is found, it will be reported for repair immediately. When this system was first established, some drivers felt inconvenient; the inspectors were opposed and also wavered. However, the leaders insisted on this system, using examples to explain the importance of inspection to the masses, and persuaded the masses to consciously abide by it. After a period of time, the drivers realized that this system is beneficial to safe production, and they actively welcome the inspection, and the technical condition of the vehicles has been significantly improved.

Third, conduct periodic ideological and technical ranking, and conduct political and ideological education and technical education for drivers who neglect safe driving and have technical shortcomings. Conduct regular on-site or in-vehicle inspections of driving operations, carry out criticism and praise, help drivers improve their skills, and earnestly implement the key points of operation, such as three stabilities (stable turning, driving, and parking), five slows (slowing down when meeting vehicles, in windy and rainy weather, when crossing bridges, railways, and intersections), and two non-starts (no driving of heroic vehicles, no contentious vehicles, and no driving of vehicles with faulty parts), so that drivers can concentrate on driving and avoid accidents.

Drivers' proficient mastery of driving skills is a basic condition for ensuring safety. We pay great attention to improving the operating skills of drivers, especially new drivers. The methods to improve the technical level of new drivers are: first, to organize new and old workers to have discussions and exchange experiences; and second, to adopt a step-by-step approach, first driving small cars and then large cars, first driving day shifts and then night shifts, first driving single cars and then trailers, and first driving in the suburbs and then in the urban areas.

Strengthen Cooperation with All Parties

In order to do a good job in safe transportation, our depot has not only educated employees to abide by traffic regulations and closely cooperated with traffic police, but also carried out work in many aspects. First, strengthen ties with industrial and mining enterprises, government agencies, schools, and neighborhood committees to jointly maintain traffic order. Second, strengthen contact with relevant transportation departments, such as studying with the public bus company how to meet vehicles, overtake, and give way during vehicle driving. Third, obtain the assistance of consignment units to improve on-site roads and provide favorable conditions for safe transportation. Fourth, strengthen the cooperation between loaders and drivers. Loaders often remind pedestrians to pay attention to vehicles while driving, help drivers take care of reversing, and assist drivers in maintaining vehicles as much as possible. Fifth, do a good job in family work. Advocate family harmony, so that workers can eat well, rest well, have a happy mood, and be full of energy.

With the development of the capital's production and construction, the task of motor vehicle transportation is becoming more and more arduous, and the existing experience cannot fully meet the needs of the objective situation. We must continue to exert our efforts, strive for the upstream, carry out the "Safety, Economy, 10,000 Ton-Kilometers per Ton-Month" campaign more deeply, and strive to achieve all the targets of increasing production and practicing economy and safe transportation.

    安全行车的几点体会
    中共北京市运输公司清河汽车场总支书记　梁作平
    我们清河汽车场已经有三年没有发生伤亡事故。在这个期间，全场一百二十七辆汽车和一百四十三辆挂车共安全行驶一千三百二十六万多公里。在去年大跃进的基础上，今年1至5月份超额完成运输计划25％，比去年同期提高了81％；节约汽油六万六千多公升；现在汽车完好率达到99.21％，挂车完好率达到97.74％；运输成本降低36.21％。全场已有四十四辆汽车的车吨月产量达到和超过了“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”运动的产量指标（按规定，城市短途运输车吨月产八千吨公里）。我们在工作中有以下体会。
    增产节约和安全运输可以双丰收
    过去我场职工在完成运输任务、节约和安全运输这几方面，有时抓住了这头，放松了那头，不能作到增产节约和安全运输双丰收。在整风运动中，经过大鸣大放大辩论，比较透彻地研究了这个问题。经过具体分析，全场职工认识到，增加生产、厉行节约的许多措施，如提高驾驶技术，改善汽车技术状况，改善道路条件等，也是保证安全生产的好办法。在汽车运输工作方面，增产节约和安全运输是统一的。某些具体作法，如加快行车速度，多带挂车和增开夜班等，也有不利于安全的因素，可能影响行车安全。我场对那些既能实现增产节约又能保证安全运输的方法，都采取一切有效措施积极推广。对那些有利增产节约而在一定程度上不利于安全运输的经验，采取领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合的办法，研究有效的防范措施，来消除不利安全的因素。例如推行汽车拖挂运输，对安全有一定影响，我们便积极提高挂车的修造质量，注意经常保养和加固，保证挂车完好，避免因挂车发生故障而造成事故；同时研究哪些路线、哪些现场、哪些汽车、哪些司机适于带挂车，带几辆最经济、最安全。根据时间、地点等条件，具体运用拖挂运输的经验。现在我场除石炭车外，基本上做到了一车两挂。推行汽车拖挂以来，没有发生过事故。在加快汽车周转方面，起初有人只考虑加快行驶速度，因而感到同安全行驶矛盾很大。后来领导方面同职工们一起分析了行车速度有关的各个环节，认为只要从各方面做好工作，就会避免上述缺陷。例如缩短汽车装卸时间，同运货单位搞好协作，简化手续，改进调度工作，提高里程利用率，减少汽车跑空，改善现场道路条件等等，都能有效地减少汽车停歇等待时间，提高运输效率，加快汽车周转。通过对这些问题的讨论，大家逐步了解了增产节约和安全运输的正确关系，找到了处理两者之间的矛盾的途径。全体职工对安全运输充满了信心。
    改进管理制度提高工人技术
    整风运动以来，我们依靠群众，不断地改进了企业管理制度，在保证安全运输方面，我们建立了下述制度。
    第一，根据汽车运输的特点，建立了每天“车前讲话”、每星期一次“安全活动日”、节日前夕开展较大规模安全活动的制度。鉴于过去建立制度，有的往往流于形式，这次每建立一项制度，都认真发动群众讨论，务使制度切合实际，深入人心。出车前的安全讲话，由小队长执行，主要是结合当天运输任务，根据天气、道路等情况提出注意事项。在每周的安全活动日，都要召开会议，检查一周安全生产情况，交流安全行车经验，揭发事故苗子，开展批评与自我批评。节日前夕的安全活动，主要是针对节日街道行人车辆稠密、交通情况复杂等，提醒驾驶工人格外注意，并且制定有效措施，防止发生事故。由于我们注意了各项活动内容要结合实际，形式要生动活泼，工人感到安全活动日和车前讲话对工作有帮助，都积极参加。
    第二，抓紧汽车出入场技术状况的检查。为了避免汽车因机件失灵，发生行车事故，我场设置了安全检查员，每天出车前都要认真检验车辆的技术状况。发现机件失灵，立即修理，修好以后再出车；在收车时也进行周密的检验，发现故障立即报修。这项制度刚建立时，有的驾驶工人感到不方便；检验人员遭到反对，也产生过动摇情绪。但是领导方面坚持了这项制度，用实例向群众说明检验的重要性，说服群众自觉地遵守。经过一个时期以后，司机体会到这一制度对安全生产有好处，主动欢迎检验，汽车技术状况显著提高。
    第三，定期进行思想和技术排队，对忽视安全行驶和技术上有缺点的司机，分别进行政治思想教育和技术教育。定期到路线上或随车检查驾驶操作，开展批评、表扬，帮助司机提高技术，认真贯彻执行操作要点，如三稳（转弯、行驶、停车稳）、五慢（会车、风雨天气、过桥、过铁路、过交叉路口慢）、二不开
  （不开英雄车、斗气车，不开机件失灵车）等，使司机在行车时精神集中，避免发生事故。
    司机熟练地掌握驾驶技术是保证安全的基本条件。我们很注意提高司机特别是新司机的操作技术。提高新司机技术水平的方法，一是经常组织新老工人座谈，交流经验；一是采取循序渐进的办法，先开小型车后开大型车，先开日班车后开夜班车，先开单车后开拖挂车，先在郊区后到市区。
    加强同各方面的协作
    我场为搞好安全运输，除教育职工遵守交通规则，和交通民警密切协作外，还从多方面进行了工作。一是加强与工矿企业、机关、学校、居民委员会的联系，共同维护交通秩序。二是加强同有关交通运输部门的联系，如和公共汽车公司研究解决车辆行驶中如何会车、超车、让路等。三是取得托运单位协助，改善现场道路，给安全运输提供有利条件。四是加强装卸工人和汽车司机的协作。装卸工人在行驶中经常提醒行人注意汽车，帮助司机照顾倒车，并且尽可能地协助司机保养车辆。五是作好家属工作。提倡家庭和睦，使工人吃好，休息好，心情舒畅，精神饱满。
    随着首都生产建设的发展，汽车运输任务也越来越繁重，现有的经验还不能完全适应客观形势的需要。我们要继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，把“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”运动更深入地开展起来，争取各项增产节约和安全运输的指标都能胜利实现。（附图片）
