Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch from Tokyo: The incident of a US military jet fighter crashing in Ishikawa City, Okinawa Island, resulting in the death and injury of over a hundred elementary school students and residents, has ignited anger and protest among the people of Okinawa. They are demanding accountability from the US military.

According to a report in today's "Akahata" [Red Flag newspaper], all members of the Ryukyu Legislative Assembly immediately conducted an on-site investigation at the scene of the accident that day. The Legislative Assembly then unanimously passed a resolution to pursue the responsibility of the US military.

"Akahata" said that aircraft crashes occur frequently on Okinawa Island. This incident has had a heavy psychological impact on the residents. Due to this incident, the people of Okinawa have become even more clearly aware that as long as the US military is stationed in Okinawa, the lives and property of the people cannot be protected.

Chairman of the Okinawa People's Party, Kamejiro Senaga, made a statement in today's "Akahata" saying that the US military authorities should, of course, provide full material compensation to the victims, but the fundamental problem lies in the US military's occupation of Okinawa, turning the entire island into a nuclear war base.

Senaga pointed out that as long as this situation does not change, the lives and property of the people of Okinawa are not guaranteed.

Senaga said that from now on, the struggle of the people of Okinawa to demand the withdrawal of US nuclear bases and strive for reunification with Japan will be combined with the struggle against the implementation of the new "Criminal Law" and against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and will become increasingly high.

Soichi Okada, Director of the International Bureau of the Japan Socialist Party, said yesterday that the root cause of the incident is the US military's base on Okinawa Island and that they should be removed. He also said that this incident may spark a massive anti-US base movement in Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch from Tokyo: US air force bases in Japan have brought great disasters to local residents. According to today's "Asahi Shimbun," in the past year alone, there have been about one hundred incidents of US Air Force aircraft crashes and forced landings due to accidents, causing residents near US military bases to feel "terror" towards the bases.

The newspaper said that in Sunagawa Town, near the Tachikawa Air Force Base, there have been six aircraft crashes since the establishment of the US military base, injuring five residents and burning down the homes of ten households. In addition, crops in the fields have also suffered great losses.

At the Yokota base, where the US Air Force fighter-bomber unit is stationed, during the US war of aggression against Korea, US military jets even often landed in the fields, and sometimes dropped bombs from the air. In September 1955, an incident occurred in Hachioji City, near Yokota Base, where an aircraft crashed into a farmer's house, killing five and injuring two farmers, and destroying five houses.

In Fukuoka City, where the US military has the Itazuke Air Force Base, there have been three consecutive US Air Force jet crashes this year. In addition, there have been several accidents in which aircraft-carried auxiliary fuel tanks fell, crushing a woman to death in her home.

The newspaper also reported on the disasters brought by the Atsugi base to the residents of Yamato City. Due to the frequent takeoffs and landings of American aircraft, many local residents suffer from insomnia, and the number of patients is increasing.

    美军飞机坠落伤害成百
    冲绳居民冲绳人民要求追究美军责任
    驻日美军基地给居民带来无穷苦难
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：美军喷气式战斗机在冲绳岛石川市坠落以致撞死和撞伤一百多名小学生和居民的事件，激起了冲绳人民的愤怒和抗议。他们要求追究美军的责任。
    据“赤旗报”今天报道，琉球立法院全体议员当天立即到肇事地点进行现场调查。立法院随即一致通过决议，要追究美军的责任。
      “赤旗报”说，冲绳岛常常发生这种飞机坠落事件。这次事件使居民们在精神上受到了沉重的打击。由于这次事件冲绳人民已经更清楚地认识到：只要美军驻在冲绳，人民的生命和财产是保不住的。
    冲绳人民党主席濑长龟次郎今天在
  “赤旗报”上发表谈话说，美军当局当然应该对牺牲者给予充分的物质赔偿，但是根本问题在于美军盘踞冲绳，把冲绳全岛变成核战争基地。
    濑长指出，只要这种状态不改变，冲绳人民的生命和财产就没有保障。
    濑长说，从此，冲绳人民要求美军撤销核基地和争取复归日本的斗争将结合反对实行新“刑法”和反对修改日美
  “安全条约”的斗争，越来越高涨。
    日本社会党国际局长冈田宗司昨天说，事件发生的根本原因是美国在冲绳岛设有基地，应该撤除它们。他还说，这个事件可能在日本激起一个反对美国基地的巨大运动。
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：美国在日本的空军基地给当地居民带来了很大灾害。据“朝日新闻”今天报道，仅仅在去年一年，美国空军飞机的坠落和由于事故被迫降落等事件就发生了约一百起，使靠近美军基地的居民对（美军）基地感到“恐怖”。
    报纸说，在邻近立川空军基地的砂川町，从美军设立基地到目前为止，已经发生了六次飞机坠落事件，有五名居民因此而受伤，十户居民的房屋被烧坏。此外，田里的庄稼也受到了很大损失。
    在驻有美国空军战斗轰炸机部队的横田基地，在美军进行侵略朝鲜的战争时期，美军喷气式飞机甚至常常降落在田里，有时还从空中落下炸弹。1955年9月间在横田基地附近的八王子市发生了飞机坠落于农民房屋上的事件，撞死五名和撞伤二名农民，五间房屋被烧毁。
    在美军设有板付空军基地的福冈市，今年以来已经连续发生了三件美国空军喷气式飞机坠落事件。另外，还发生了几次飞机携带的副油箱落下的事故，压死了一名在家里的妇女。
    报纸还报道了厚木基地给大和市居民带来的灾害的情况。当地居民由于美国飞机的频繁的起飞和降落的轰鸣声，许多人患了失眠症，并且病人越来越多。
