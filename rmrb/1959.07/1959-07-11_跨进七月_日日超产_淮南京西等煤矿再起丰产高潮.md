Xinhua News Agency, Huaibei, July 10th: The Huainan Coal Mine, which won the Coal Industry Ministry's Red Flag for Large-Area Bumper Harvests and completed its coal production task for the first half of the year two days ahead of schedule, is in high spirits and determined to push production levels to a new peak in the third quarter. The entire mining bureau plans to increase the average daily production level in the third quarter by 16% compared to the first half of the year, and by 70% compared to the same period in 1958. Since July, the daily output has increased by 1,178 tons compared to the average daily output in the first half of the year.

While vigorously increasing production levels, the mining bureau has also conscientiously strengthened production preparation work. The leaders of the mining bureau went to the front line and conducted detailed surveys of the affiliated mines. Based on the requirements of horizontal succession, mining area succession, and working face succession, they arranged three excavation forces to accelerate production excavation work, so that the mines would have a coal reserve period in the third quarter one month longer than in the first half of the year, to ensure sustained large-area bumper harvests.

In the past two days, the Huainan coal mines have convened employee representative meetings to enthusiastically discuss the call issued by the Ministry of Coal Industry at the telephone conference on the 4th. The employees have put forward plans for increasing production and practicing economy, as well as specific measures to implement the plans. They also intend to actively promote the 36 experiences proposed by the Ministry of Coal Industry, to further advance the large-area bumper harvest Red Flag competition, and to ensure the comprehensive completion of the third quarter plan.

Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: Workers of all mines under the Jingxi Mining Bureau are actively responding to the call of the Ministry of Coal Industry, determined to work hard for three months and greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day with the most outstanding production achievements.

As early as mid-June, the Jingxi Mining Bureau carried out a series of preparations for the comprehensive over-fulfillment of the third quarter production plan. After the Ministry of Coal Industry held a telephone conference on July 4, the mining bureau held a cadre meeting, put forward further measures, and required all mines to quickly mobilize the masses, and on the basis of establishing and improving the enterprise management system, to focus on both excavation and mining, and immediately push the large-area bumper harvest movement to a new climax. A high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency competition has gradually unfolded in various mines. In the discussion of the plan, the workers of the Datai Mine carefully calculated the accounts, tapped the potential, and formulated guarantee measures. At the beginning of July, they launched a team competition. Now the mine has overfulfilled the production plan from July 1st to 5th. Among them, the workers of the tenth mining team, due to good cooperation, produced coal as soon as they took over the shift. Therefore, each shift overproduced and exceeded the quota every day. The cumulative output in five days has exceeded the plan by 97%.

In the first half of this year, the workers of all mines under the Jingxi Mining Bureau strengthened production preparation and equipment maintenance in the large-area bumper harvest Red Flag competition, which strongly promoted production. The coal output in the first half of the year increased by 68.7% compared with the same period last year, labor productivity increased by 56% compared with the same period last year, and the cost of raw coal decreased by 30% compared with the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 10th: The workers of the three major coal mines in Heilongjiang Province, Hegang, Jixi, and Shuangyashan, are working hard to achieve the leap forward targets for the third quarter, and guarantee to create more outstanding production achievements to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

The requirements put forward by the Ministry of Coal Industry at the telephone conference on July 4th and the proposals put forward by the five major coal mines such as Jingxi and Huainan have further stimulated the enthusiasm of the workers. In the first week of the third quarter, the workers of Shuangyashan Coal Mine have created a good start for realizing the quarterly leap forward target. From July 1st to 7th, the coal output reached 81,594 tons, an increase of 187 tons over the original plan; the total excavation footage exceeded the original plan by 113 meters; and the completion of other indicators was also good.

The workers of the Hegang Mining Bureau are determined to continue their efforts on the basis of comprehensively over-fulfilling the raw coal production plan for the first half of the year, and guarantee to strive for a double harvest of coal mining and excavation with greater efforts in the third quarter. To this end, they have put forward practical and effective improvement measures for the problems existing in excavation, stripping, improving quality, reducing costs, and safety. The workers of the Jixi Mining Bureau also put forward the following specific conditions to challenge the workers of Jingxi and other mines: guarantee the balanced completion and over-fulfillment of the third quarter production plan; eliminate major accidents; the production cost of raw coal should be reduced by an average of 5% compared with last year, and labor productivity should be increased by 30% compared with the first half of the year.

    跨进七月  日日超产
    淮南京西等煤矿再起丰产高潮
    本报淮南10日电　荣获煤炭部大面积丰产红旗、提前两天完成上半年煤炭生产任务的淮南煤矿，广大职工意气风发，决心在第三季度把生产水平推向新的高峰。全矿务局第三季度计划平均日产水平比上半年日产水平提高16％，比1958年同期提高70％。7月份以来，每天产量比上半年平均日产量增加一千一百七十八吨。
    在大力提高生产水平的同时，这个矿务局认真加强了生产准备工作。矿务局领导分头深入现场，对所属矿井进行了详细的排队摸底。他们根据矿井的水平接替、采区接替、工作面接替的要求，安排三部分掘进力量，加速生产掘进工作，使矿井获得煤量可采期限在第三季度比上半年增加一个月，以保证获得持续的大面积丰产。
    这两天，淮南各煤矿分别召开职工代表会议，热烈讨论了煤炭工业部在4日电话会议上的号召。职工们纷纷提出增产节约计划和实现计划的具体措施，并要积极推广煤炭部提出的三十六项经验，把大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动推进一步，保证全面完成第三季度计划。
    新华社9日讯　京西矿务局所属各矿职工积极响应煤炭工业部号召，决心大干三个月，用最出色的生产成绩迎接国庆十周年。
    早在6月中旬，京西矿务局就为全面超额完成第三季度生产计划进行了一系列的准备工作。煤炭工业部7月4日召开电话会议以后，矿务局又召开了干部会议，提出了进一步的措施，要求各矿迅速发动群众，在建立和健全企业管理制度的基础上，一手抓掘进，一手抓回采，立即把大面积丰产运动推向新的高潮。一个高产高质高效率的竞赛已在各矿逐步深入地展开。大台矿职工在讨论计划中，认真算了细账，挖了潜力，制订出了保证措施，7月初开展了班组竞赛。现在这个矿已超额完成了7月1日到5日的生产计划。其中回采十组工人由于协作得好，一接班就出煤，因此班班超产，日日超额，五天累计产量已超过计划97％。
    今年上半年，京西矿务局所属各矿职工在大面积丰产红旗竞赛中，加强了生产准备和设备检修工作，有力地促进了生产。上半年的煤产量比去年同期增长68.7％，劳动生产率比去年同期提高56％，原煤成本比去年同期降低了30％。
    新华社哈尔滨10日电　黑龙江省鹤岗、鸡西、双鸭山三大煤矿职工正在努力实现第三季度的跃进指标，保证创造更出色的生产成绩迎接国庆十周年。
    煤炭工业部7月4日电话会议提出的要求和京西、淮南等五大煤矿提出的倡议传到这三个煤矿以后，更加激发了职工们的干劲。双鸭山煤矿职工在第三季度的第一周里，已经为实现全季度大跃进指标创造了良好开端，1日至7日煤炭产量达到八万一千五百九十四吨，比原计划增加一百八十七吨；掘进总进尺超过原计划一百一十三公尺；其它各项指标的完成情况也较好。
    鹤岗矿务局的职工，决心在全面超额完成上半年原煤生产计划的基础上再接再厉，保证在第三季度以更大的干劲力争采煤和掘进双丰收。为此，他们针对掘进、剥离、提高质量、降低成本、安全等方面所存在的问题，提出了切实有效的改进措施。鸡西矿务局的职工也提出了以下的具体条件，向京西等矿职工应战：保证均衡完成和超额完成第三季度生产计划；消灭重大事故；原煤生产成本要比去年平均降低5％，劳动生产率比上半年提高30％。（附图片）
