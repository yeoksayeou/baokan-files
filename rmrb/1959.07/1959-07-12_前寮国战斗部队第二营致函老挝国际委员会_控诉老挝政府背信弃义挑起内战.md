Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th -- According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency, the letter written on June 22nd by Tao Du, the representative of the former Lao Fighting Forces Second Battalion, to Chairman of the International Commission for Laos, General Bal, was released here today. The letter details the extremely serious actions of the Phoui Sananikone government in violating the Geneva Accords, breaking the agreement signed between the Lao Kingdom Government and the former Lao Fighting Forces, launching a civil war, and persecuting personnel of the former Lao Fighting Forces. It demands that the Lao Kingdom Government cease its attacks on the Second Battalion and calls for the resumption of activities by the International Commission.

The letter was entrusted to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for delivery. Tao Du also gave a copy of the letter to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as a party to the Geneva Agreements on Laos and responsible for the implementation of the agreements.

The letter first narrates the process by which the Phoui Sananikone government conspired to persecute and eliminate the former Lao Fighting Forces and instigate civil war.

The letter points out that the Lao Kingdom Government had long refused to incorporate the former Lao Fighting Forces into the Kingdom's army and had implemented discriminatory policies, reducing their food rations. In May 1959, it suddenly announced that it would grant ranks to the personnel of the Second Battalion, attempting "to use this trick to disarm and disband the former Lao Fighting Forces."

The letter states that, faced with this conspiracy, the Second Battalion suggested negotiations, but the Kingdom Government rejected this legitimate suggestion. On the contrary, it prohibited personnel of the Second Battalion from leaving the barracks, dispatched paratrooper units, and cut off the food supply to the Second Battalion. It also threatened the personnel of the Second Battalion, saying that if they did not lay down their weapons and accept ranks, the Second Battalion would be "completely eliminated."

The letter states that, under these circumstances, the Second Battalion left its original station to avoid conflict. The Phoui Sananikone government then mobilized armed forces, including infantry, mechanized units, heavy artillery, and aircraft, to continuously surround and attack the Second Battalion, which was forced to engage in self-defense. Moreover, it repelled multiple attacks by the Kingdom's army. The letter states that since the Second Battalion left the Plain of Jars, it had repeatedly written to the Kingdom Government suggesting a ceasefire and negotiations, but these had been rejected.

The letter says: "With the active support of the people, we have now arrived in the southeast of Xieng Khouang Province. The Phoui Sananikone government is still massing troops and taking terrorist actions in this area. They are shooting cadres and members of the Lao Patriotic Front, persecuting the people, and trying every means to eliminate the Second Battalion. For nearly a month, the Kingdom's army has not ceased firing."

The letter then refutes the remarks made by "the foreign ministry of a certain major power that bears important responsibility for the implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos" that "the situation in Laos is safe and sound and the Phoui Sananikone government is resolving internal affairs in a peaceful manner." The letter says that the aforementioned facts about the serious situation in Laos are a "satire" of these remarks.

The letter then lists a large number of facts, exposing another aspect of the Phoui Sananikone government's violation of the Geneva Agreements and the agreements signed with the former Lao Fighting Forces, namely the brutal persecution of the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and former resistance personnel.

The letter points out: "All the above-mentioned actions of the Phoui Sananikone government and pro-American officers are carried out under the instigation and coercion of U.S. imperialism, and are part of the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Agreements on Laos, drag Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive military bloc, and turn Laos into a U.S. colony and military base."

The letter says: "The United States is constantly transporting large quantities of weapons, war materials, and large numbers of American military personnel into Laos, and these military personnel currently actually control the army and police of the Kingdom of Laos."

The letter says: "Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the Phoui Sananikone government is increasingly stepping up its collusion with the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities in South Vietnam, the pro-American regime in Thailand, and the Chiang Kai-shek regime, forming a disguised Southeast Asian military alliance to serve the U.S. imperialist aggression plan."

The letter says: "The Phoui Sananikone government has completely abandoned the path of peace, neutrality, and national independence. They have violated the desire of our entire people to achieve national harmony and a unified country. They have clearly become tools of U.S. imperialism, betrayed the interests of the nation, and willingly allowed U.S. imperialism to turn Laos into its colony and a military base for aggression."

The letter points out that the above-mentioned actions of the Phoui Sananikone reactionary clique seriously violate the Geneva Accords on Laos and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, as well as the relevant clauses of the agreement signed with the former Lao Fighting Forces. They must bear full responsibility for the consequences of the civil war they have provoked.

The letter says: "We demand that the Kingdom Government immediately cease its attacks on the Second Battalion; thoroughly and strictly implement the Geneva Accords so as to enable the International Commission for Laos to resume its activities; thoroughly and strictly implement the various agreements signed between the Kingdom Government and the former Lao Fighting Forces; strictly implement a policy of peace and neutrality on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; abandon the path of subservience to the U.S. preparations for war; establish a coalition government with representatives from the Lao Patriotic Front, representatives from various progressive parties, and representatives from all ethnic peoples; guarantee all democratic freedoms and rights of the people, respect the National Assembly and the Constitution; immediately abolish the policies of persecution and discrimination against the Lao Patriotic Front, and revoke the ban on the closure of the 'Lao Patriotic News'; release all the detained former resistance personnel and patriots; completely lift the secret control over our leaders, including Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front; respect the administrative regulations of Phongsaly and Houaphan provinces; return the former Lao Fighting Forces personnel who held various positions under the agreements signed by both sides but were later transferred and placed under house arrest elsewhere, to the people of the two provinces; and stop the discriminatory behavior against the former Lao Fighting Forces personnel who have been incorporated into the Kingdom's government agencies."

The letter says: "No reactionary force can eliminate the former Lao Fighting Forces. No reactionary force can eliminate the Lao Patriotic Front, because we will always stand on the side of the people, always defend the interests of the people, and always hold high the banner of peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, national harmony, and a unified country."

The letter says: "Under the current circumstances, our Second Battalion will follow the line of the Lao Patriotic Front, headed by Prince Souphanouvong, in accordance with the most urgent desires and interests of the Lao people, to continue to fight to defend ourselves, defend the people, defend peace and neutrality, and strive for national independence and national unification."

    前寮国战斗部队第二营致函老挝国际委员会
    控诉老挝政府背信弃义挑起内战
    新华社河内11日电　据越南通讯社报道，今天此间公布了前寮国战斗部队第二营的代表陶杜6月22日写给老挝国际委员会主席巴尔中将的一封信，信中详细地揭露了培·萨纳尼空政府破坏日内瓦协议、破坏老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议，发动内战，迫害前寮国战斗部队人员的极其严重的行为，要求老挝王国政府停止对第二营的进攻，并且要求恢复国际委员会的活动。
    这封信是托越南民主共和国政府转交的。陶杜同时还把这封信的抄件交给作为缔结关于老挝的日内瓦协议的一方、并且对协议的履行负有责任的越南民主共和国政府。
    这封信首先叙述了培·萨纳尼空政府阴谋迫害和消灭前寮国战斗部队并且挑动内战的经过。
    信中指出，老挝王国政府长期拒绝把前寮国战斗部队并入王国军队，并且执行了歧视政策，削减他们的军粮供应，到1959年5月，突然宣布要授予第二营人员军衔，企图“利用这个诡计来解除前寮国战斗部队方面的武装和解散这个营”。
    信中说，面对着这种阴谋，第二营曾经建议双方协商，但是王国政府方面拒绝这个正当的建议，相反地，禁止第二营人员离开营房，并且调来了伞兵部队，切断了给予第二营的粮食供应。并且威胁第二营人员说，如果不放下武器和接受军衔，就要“全部消灭”第二营。
    信中说，在这种情况下，第二营为了避免冲突，离开了原驻地。培·萨纳尼空政府就调动了包括步兵、机械化部队、重型大炮、飞机等武装力量，连续地包围和进攻第二营，第二营被迫进行了自卫战斗。而且击退了王国军队的多次进攻。信中说，在第二营离开镇宁平原以来，曾经多次写信向王国政府建议停止射击和举行协商，但是都遭到了拒绝。
    信中说：“在人民的积极支持下，我们现在已经来到川圹省东南。培·萨纳尼空政府仍然在集结兵力，向这个地区采取恐怖行动。他们枪杀老挝爱国战线党的干部和党员，残害人民，千方百计地要消灭第二营。近一个月以来，王国军队一直没有停火。”
    这封信接着驳斥了“对关于老挝的日内瓦协议的履行负有重要责任的某大国的外交部”所发表的“老挝的局势安然无事和培·萨纳尼空政府正在用和平方式来解决内部事务”的言论，信中说，上述的关于老挝严重局势的实况正是对这种言论的一种“讽刺”。
    这封信接着列举大量事实，揭露了培·萨纳尼空政府破坏日内瓦协议以及同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议的另一方面的行为，即对老挝爱国战线党的领袖、前抗战人员的残酷迫害。
    信中指出：“培·萨纳尼空政府和亲美的军官的上述一切行为，都是在美帝国主义的唆使和强迫下进行的，都是美帝国主义破坏关于老挝日内瓦协议，把老挝拉入东南亚侵略军事集团，把老挝变成美国的殖民地和军事基地的阴谋的一部分。”
    信中说：“美国不断地把大量武器、战争物资和大量美国军事人员运入老挝，这些军事人员目前实际上控制着老挝王国的军队和警察。
    信中说：“在美帝国主义的指使下，培·萨纳尼空政府日益加紧同南越吴庭艳当局、泰国亲美政权和蒋介石政权相勾结，组成了变相的东南亚军事联盟，为美帝国主义的侵略计划服务。”
    信中说：“培·萨纳尼空政府完全放弃了和平、中立和民族独立的道路。他们违背了我们全国人民要求实现民族和睦和统一国家的愿望。他们显然已经成为美帝国主义的工具，背叛了民族的利益，甘心让美帝国主义把老挝变成它的殖民地和一个进行侵略的军事基地。”
    信中指出，培·萨纳尼空反动集团的上述行为极其严重地违反了日内瓦会议关于老挝的协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言以及同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议的有关条款。他们必须对自己挑起的内战的后果负完全责任。
    信中说：“我们要求王国政府立即停止进攻第二营；彻底和严正地履行日内瓦协议以便使老挝国际委员会恢复活动；彻底和严正地履行王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的各项协议；在和平共处五项原则的基础上，严格执行和平中立政策；放弃屈从美国准备战争的道路；成立有老挝爱国战线党代表、各进步党派的代表和各民族人民的代表参加的联合政府；保证人民的一切民主自由权利，尊重国会和宪法；立即取消对老挝爱国战线党进行迫害和歧视的政策，撤销封闭‘老挝爱国报’的禁令；释放被拘禁的全部前抗战人员和爱国者；完全取消对包括老挝爱国战线党主席苏发努冯亲王在内的我们的领导人的秘密管制；尊重丰沙里和桑怒两省的行政组织规章；把根据双方签订的协议而担任各种职务、但后来被调动和软禁在其他地方的前寮国战斗部队人员，交还两省人民；停止对已经编入王国政权机构的前寮国战斗部队人员的歧视行为。”
    信中说：“任何反动力量都消灭不了前寮国战斗部队。任何反动力量都消灭不了老挝爱国战线党，因为我们永远站在人民的一边，永远保卫人民的利益，永远高举和平中立、独立民主、民族和睦和统一国家的旗帜。”
  信中说：“在目前的情况下，我们第二营将根据老挝人民最迫切的愿望和利益，遵循着以苏发努冯亲王为首的老挝爱国战线党的路线，为继续保卫自己、保卫人民、保卫和平中立、争取民族独立和国家统一而战斗。”
