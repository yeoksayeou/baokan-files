Small Information

    Mid-season rice is a type of single-season rice cultivated in southern China. In recent years, the total cultivated area has been around 140 million mu. Although mid-season rice is distributed throughout the South, the provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei have the largest areas, accounting for almost 70% of the total planting area. The growing period of mid-season rice is about 140 to 150 days, generally sown in early April, transplanted from mid-May to mid-June, and matures in early to mid-September.

    The vegetative growth period of mid-season rice is longer than that of early rice, and the natural conditions such as sunshine and temperature are better during the period from June to September, which is extremely beneficial to its growth and development. Therefore, in most areas, the unit yield of mid-season rice is higher than that of early rice and double-cropping late rice.

    After the harvest of mid-season rice, the vacant fields can be planted with buckwheat, velvet beans that mature in the same year, or replanted with regeneratively grown rice that matures in the same year; after a short fallow period, summer-ripening crops such as rapeseed, which are harvested the following year, can also be planted.

    南方地区的中稻
    中稻是我国南方地区栽培的一季水稻。近几年来，栽培总面积多在一亿四千万亩左右。中稻虽然分布整个南方，但以四川、湖南、江苏、安徽和湖北等省的面积较多，几乎占总栽插面积的70％以上。中稻的生长期约一百四、五十天，一般是4月上旬播种，5月中旬到6月中旬插秧，9月上、中旬成熟。
    中稻营养生长期比早稻长，6至9月这个时期的光照、气温等自然条件好，对它的生长发育极为有利。因此就多数地区说，中稻的单位产量高于早稻和双季晚稻。
    中稻收获以后的空闲田，可以种植当年成熟的荞麦、泥豆或蓄留当年可熟的再生稻；也可以经过短期休闲以后，种植第二年收获的油菜等夏熟作物。
