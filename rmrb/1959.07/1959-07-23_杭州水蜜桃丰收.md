    Hangzhou Honey Peach Harvest

    The Hangzhou Huawu Orchard honey peaches, known for their large size, thin skin, and sweet taste, have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. The honey peaches produced by this orchard include dozens of varieties such as "Yangtao," "Golden Peach," and "Wuyun." Among them, the "Wuyun" peach is of the best quality and also the most abundant, accounting for more than 70% of the total. Preliminary estimates indicate that the total output of honey peaches in Huawu Orchard this year may reach more than 600,000 jin, an increase of more than four times compared to last year.

    In order to strive for a bumper harvest of honey peaches year after year, the workers of this orchard sprayed all of the more than 12,000 peach trees in the entire orchard with DDT and 666 pesticides seven or eight times after all the peaches were harvested last summer, and also accumulated and applied a large amount of fertilizer. Since this spring, flower fertilizer, fruit protection fertilizer, and fruit-promoting fertilizer have been continuously applied to the peach trees. Due to the strengthened management of the fruit trees and the reasonable application of fertilizer, the quality and yield of honey peaches have greatly increased this year, with each peach weighing about five liang, and the largest ones weighing nine or ten liang.

    杭州水蜜桃丰收
    个大、皮薄、道味甜美的杭州市花坞果园水蜜桃，今年获得空前大丰收。这所果园出产的水蜜桃，有“阳桃”、“黄金
  “五云”等几十个品种。其中以“五云”桃的质量最好，出产也多，约占70％以上。据初步估计，今年花坞果园水蜜桃的总产量约可达六十余万斤，比去年增长四倍多。
    这个果园的职工，为了争取水蜜桃连年获得大丰收，早在去年夏天，当桃子全部下树后，就将全园一万二千多株桃树，先后喷施了七、八次滴滴涕和六六六药剂，并大量积肥和施肥。今春以来，又不断给桃树施花前肥、保果肥和催果肥。由于对果树加强了管理，并合理施肥，所以今年水蜜桃的质量和产量都大大提高，每只桃子重达五两左右，顶大的有九、十两重。
