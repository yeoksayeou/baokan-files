Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 30th: According to TASS, the US, British, and French delegations presented their proposals on the West Berlin issue to the Soviet delegation on the 28th. Swiss newspapers report that the full text of the proposal, after consultation, will not be published for the time being. However, these newspapers cited the content of the proposals in their July 29th editions.

A comparison of the Western countries’ "new" proposals with their old proposals of June 16th shows that, in fact, there is no difference between the two proposals. They both stipulate that the occupying forces in West Berlin should maintain their original numbers.

Regarding the duration of a temporary agreement on West Berlin, the Western countries' "new" plan stipulates that the agreement will remain in effect until Germany is reunified. The proposal states that if Germany fails to achieve reunification within five years, the foreign ministers can meet to re-examine the situation, if they so desire.

It is clear that the Western countries have not retreated one step from their position. Their position is to maintain the outdated occupation regime in West Berlin indefinitely.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 30th: Our correspondent reports: The foreign ministers of the East and West in Geneva are studying and discussing two sets of draft documents drafted separately by the two sides. The outcome of the discussion will determine the outcome of the foreign ministers' conference.

After holding a series of secret talks this week, the foreign ministers decided to draft documents on the various issues that have been discussed so far. Drafts of these documents have been prepared and exchanged late on the 28th for comparison and discussion by both sides.

US Secretary of State Herter invited Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko on the 29th to exchange views on these two sets of documents. Afterwards, both the Soviet and US delegations announced that there were substantial differences between the two sides.

The foreign ministers decided not to publish these documents for the time being. The US delegation said that the Western documents did not substantially depart from the Western proposals of June 16th. According to Western newspapers, the Western countries have not made any concessions on the crucial issue of the number of Western troops stationed in West Berlin. In the newly drafted document, they continue to insist that the number of Western troops stationed should be maintained at the current 11,000. Previously, Lloyd had indicated that the Western troops could be reduced to 7,000.

It is reported that on the issue of stopping subversive activities by West Berlin against the German Democratic Republic, the Western countries still want to include East Berlin on a "mutual basis." The Soviet delegation has repeatedly refuted such suggestions. In the new document, Herter put forward a demand that created new complications. He demanded that UN observers be appointed to report not only on subversive and propaganda activities in West Berlin, but also on the situation in East Berlin.

The Western documents do not mention the All-German Committee at all, which shows that the Western countries do not want to seek reconciliation between the two Germanys during the temporary agreement on West Berlin in order to promote the resolution of the German peace treaty issue and the German unification issue.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 29th: Kögl, the spokesperson for the delegation of the German Democratic Republic participating in the Geneva conference, said in a television broadcast today that the Western countries' proposals on West Berlin, submitted to the Soviet Union on July 28th, cannot serve as a basis for realistic negotiations.

Kögl said: These proposals basically repeat the Western proposals of June 16th, proving that some people in the West are trying to obstruct a reasonable solution to the West Berlin issue. If they really want a temporary solution to the West Berlin issue, they must adopt a realistic negotiating position.

Kögl also said that a temporary agreement on West Berlin must mean reducing the constant threat from West Berlin to peace and to the German Democratic Republic. This is only possible when subversive and destructive activities are stopped and the Western occupying forces are reduced to a symbolic number. On this issue, the West must abandon their position.

Kögl emphasized that the German Democratic Republic can never accept the Western countries' proposals on the duration of the temporary solution for West Berlin. This proposal does not want to solve the West Berlin issue at all.

Referring to the issue of the Four Powers supervising the access routes to West Berlin, Kögl said that this proposal is an interference in the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic. Currently, 95% of the transportation on the routes is inspected by the institutions of the German Democratic Republic, and only 5%, that is, the military transportation of the Western occupying forces, is inspected by the Soviet institutions.

Kögl said that the Western countries' proposal to have the United Nations conduct "international supervision" of Berlin is aimed at supervising the German Democratic Republic. He said that what needs to be supervised is West Berlin, which constantly carries out destructive activities against the German Democratic Republic. Our people have the right to demand guarantees to stop such activities in West Berlin.

### 西方关于西柏林问题的新建议换汤不换药  美英法图谋永久霸占西柏林  德意志民主共和国代表团发言人指出西方建议无法接受

    西方关于西柏林问题的新建议换汤不换药
    美英法图谋永久霸占西柏林
    德意志民主共和国代表团发言人指出西方建议无法接受
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦29日讯：美国、英国和法国代表团28日把自己关于西柏林问题的建议交给了苏联代表团。据瑞士报纸报道说，这个建议的全文经过商定暂时不予公布，可是，这些报纸在29日的篇幅中却援引了这些建议的内容。
    把西方国家的“新”建议同它们在6月16日提出的老建议进行比较的结果表明，实际上这两个建议没有一点区别，它们同样规定在西柏林的占领军应保持原有数量。
    在西柏林临时协定的有效期限方面，西方国家“新”方案规定，协定在德国重新统一之前一直有效。这个建议说，如果德国在五年之内未能实现重新统一，那么，外长们可以聚会重新研究情况，如果他们愿意这样做的话。
    可见，西方国家没有从自己的立场上后退一步。它们的立场就是，要在西柏林无限期地保持已经过时的占领制度。
    据新华社日内瓦30日电　本社记者报道：在日内瓦的东西方外长们正在研究和讨论由双方分别草拟的两套文件草案。讨论的结果将决定外长会议的结局。
    外长们在本星期举行了一系列秘密会谈后，决定草拟关于迄今已经讨论过的各项问题的文件。这些文件的草案已经拟好，并在28日深夜交换，以便双方进行比较和讨论。
  美国国务卿赫脱29日邀请苏联外交部长葛罗米柯就这两套文件交换意见。事后苏联和美国代表团都宣布，双方有实质上的分歧。
    外长们决定暂时不发表这些文件。美国代表团说，西方的文件实质上没有离开6月16日的西方建议。据西方报纸透露，西方国家在西柏林西方驻军数量这个关系重大的问题上，并没有丝毫让步。他们在新草拟的文件中继续坚持西方驻军数量应保持为现有的一万一千人。而在这以前，劳埃德曾表示过，西方驻军可以减少到七千人。
    据报道，关于停止西柏林对德意志民主共和国的颠复活动问题，西方国家仍然要在“相互的基础”上把东柏林包括在内。苏联代表团已经一再驳斥过这样的建议。赫脱在新文件中，又提出一个造成新的复杂情况的要求。他要求委派联合国观察员，不仅就西柏林的颠复和宣传活动提出报告，而且还要报告东柏林的情况。
    西方的文件根本没有提到全德委员会，这表明西方国家并不想在就西柏林达成临时协议期间设法实现两个德国的和解以促进对德和约问题和德国统一问题的解决。
    新华社柏林29日电　参加日内瓦会议的德意志民主共和国代表团发言人克格尔今天在电视广播中说：西方国家7月28日交给苏联的关于西柏林的建议不能作为现实的谈判的基础。
    克格尔说：这些建议基本上重复了西方6月16日的建议，证明西方某些人士企图阻挠合理解决西柏林问题。如果他们真想要临时解决西柏林问题的话，他们就必须采取一个现实的谈判的立场。
    克格尔还说，西柏林临时协定必须意味着减少西柏林对和平和对德意志民主共和国的不断威胁。只有停止颠复破坏活动和把西方占领军减少到象征性的数目的时候，才有可能。在这个问题上，西方必须放弃他们的立场。
    克格尔着重说，德意志民主共和国绝不能接受西方提出的西柏林临时解决办法中有关期限问题的主张，这个建议根本不想解决西柏林问题。
    在谈到四大国监督西柏林的通道问题时，克格尔说，这个建议是干涉德意志民主共和国的主权。目前，通道上的交通运输的95％是由德意志民主共和国的机构来检查，只有5％，即西方占领军的军事运输是由苏联机构检查。
    克格尔说，西方国家建议让联合国对柏林进行“国际监督”的目的是要对德意志民主共和国进行监督。他说，要监督的是西柏林，它经常对德意志民主共和国进行破坏活动，我国人民有权要求保证停止西柏林的这种活动。
