The Argentine political crisis continues to deepen after the Frondizi government's cabinet reshuffle under strong pressure from domestic and foreign reactionaries, particularly the domestic army, and the situation remains tense.

The Argentine cabinet began reshuffling on June 24, appointing Alsogaray, an agent of U.S. monopoly capital, as Minister of Economy and temporarily concurrently as Minister of Labor and Social Insurance, wielding the power to strictly control the national economy, which aroused strong opposition from the Argentine public. Even the parliamentary group of the ruling "Intransigent Radical Civic Union" issued a declaration expressing strong dissatisfaction with Alsogaray's appointment as Minister of Economy. The secretary of the coordinating committee of the Argentine "Thirty-Two Unions" also told the press that "Alsogaray's appointment is the most serious mistake detrimental to the safety of Argentine workers."

The condemnation from all sides in Argentina caused Alsogaray difficulties in finding his assistants, and his intended candidates refused to cooperate with him. Alsogaray also faces another serious problem: Argentina's subservience to U.S. monopoly capital and the pressure of the "International Monetary Fund," and the resulting acceptance of the "economic stabilization plan," has further aggravated economic difficulties. In a televised address to the nation, Alsogaray admitted that "the next six months will be the most critical period for Argentina's economic recovery movement."

This cabinet reshuffle of the Argentine government was the result of pressure from the domestic military. However, the military is not satisfied with this reshuffle. According to reports, army personnel in Cordoba, in the Argentine interior, insist that Frondizi resign, believing that only Frondizi's resignation can solve the country's difficulties. According to reports, Arturo Ossorio Arana, the leader of this group of army personnel, held a secret meeting at the Cordoba headquarters, putting forward a series of demands. These demands included: the implementation of martial law and the suspension of civil rights; the expulsion of people engaged in "totalitarian activities" (referring to leftists); the declaration of a one-year suspension of the right to strike; a one-year freeze on wages and prices; fighting inflation; and the cancellation of all oil contracts signed without due legal process. The message said that they were determined to drive Frondizi out of office, if possible, by non-violent means. These army personnel also demanded the dismissal of three or four provincial governors. They said that the political attitudes of these provincial governors were in contradiction with Frondizi's declared "economic stabilization plan." Under the pressure of these army personnel, Army Minister Solanas Pacheco has already resigned, and Frondizi immediately appointed the retired Anaya as Army Minister, but many powerful military leaders are not satisfied with Anaya's appointment.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Argentina issued a statement on the current situation in Argentina, pointing out that domestic reactionary forces, in order to seize full power to deal with the increasingly powerful mass movement, recently launched a "palace coup" supported by the three military ministers. As a result, the greatest power in social and economic affairs was transferred to Alsogaray, a well-known agent of U.S. monopolists. The statement pointed out that a new coup and the establishment of an open military dictatorship may occur. Faced with this very serious situation, there is a need for "the unity of the working class, the concerted action of the working class and compatriots, and the concerted action of all democratic and national forces (in a national democratic front), to save the country from imperialist enslavement and complete colonization."

    阿根廷政治危机加深
    美国垄断组织代理人通过“宫廷政变”掌权
    本报综合报道　阿根廷弗朗迪西政府内阁在国内外反动派，特别是国内陆军的强大压力下改组后，政治危机继续加深，局势仍然紧张。
    阿根廷内阁于6月24日开始改组，任命美国垄断资本代理人阿尔索加赖为经济部长，并临时兼任劳工和社会保险部长，独揽对全国经济严格控制的大权，引起了阿根廷公众的强烈反对。甚至执政党“不妥协激进公民联盟”议员团也为此发表宣言，对任命阿耳索加赖为经济部长表示强烈不满。阿根廷“三十二工会”协调委员会书记也对报界发表谈话说，“阿耳索加赖的任命是不利于阿根廷工人安全的最严重的错误。”
    阿根廷各方的谴责，使阿耳索加赖在物色他的助手时，发生了困难，他预定的人选都拒绝同他合作。阿耳索加赖还面临另一个严重问题，阿根廷屈从美国垄断资本和“国际货币基金组织”的压力，接受“稳定经济计划”的结果，经济困难进一步恶化。阿耳索加赖在向全国发表的电视演说中承认，“今后六个月将是阿根廷恢复经济运动最危急时期”。
    阿根廷政府这次内阁改组是国内军方施加压力的结果。但是，军方对于这次改组并不满意。据报道，阿根廷内地科尔多瓦的陆军人员坚持要求弗朗迪西辞职，他们认为只有弗朗迪西辞职，才能解决国家的困难。消息说，这一批陆军人员的首领阿图罗·奥索里奥·阿拉纳曾在科尔多瓦秘密总部召开会议，提出一系列的要求。这些要求包括：实施戒严令和停止公民权利；驱逐从事“极权活动”的人士（按：指左翼人士）；宣布停止罢工权利一年；冻结工资和物价一年；同通货膨胀进行斗争；取消所有不符合法律程序而签订的石油合同。消息说，他们决心把弗朗迪西赶下台去，如果可能，便通过不流血的办法。这批陆军人员还要求把三、四个省长撤职。他们说，这些省长的政治态度同弗朗迪西所宣布的“稳定经济计划”存在矛盾。在这些陆军人员的压力下，陆军部长索拉纳斯·帕切科已经提出辞职，弗朗迪西当即任命已经退休的安纳亚为陆军部长，但是许多有势力的军事领袖并不满意安纳亚的任命。
    阿根廷共产党中央委员会特就阿根廷目前局势发表声明，指出国内的反动势力为了掌握全权来对付声势日益浩大的群众运动，最近发动了一次三军部长支持的“宫廷政变”。结果把社会和经济方面的最大权力移交给了美国垄断资本家的著名代理人阿耳索加赖。声明指出，新政变和建立公开的军事独裁政权的情况可能会发生。面对着这种十分严重的局面，就需要“工人阶级的团结，工人阶级和同胞的力量一致行动和一切民主和民族力量的一致行动（在一个全国民主阵线中），把国家从帝国主义奴役下和完全殖民主义化的情况下拯救出来”。
