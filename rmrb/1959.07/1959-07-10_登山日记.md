    Mountain Climbing Diary
    Celebrating the Festival at the Foot of the Mountain
    June 16th, Eid al-Adha. This morning, as soon as the team members got up, Kyrgyz herders from the Fifth People's Commune of Aktao County brought fifteen horses and invited the leaders of the team headquarters and female mountaineers to participate in their Eid al-Adha celebration. We rode around the snow-capped mountains for four hours, from the western base camp of Muztagh Ata to the northern Kara Lake. Many Han Chinese female comrades rode horses for the first time at the foot of Muztagh Ata, while the Tibetan female team members galloped on horseback.
    Eid al-Adha is the biggest festive holiday of the year for the Kyrgyz herders who believe in Islam. The Kara Lake was filled with a festive atmosphere. Kyrgyz women wore colorful dresses, and herders played the "Komuz" three-stringed instrument to welcome us. In the melodious music, a group of Young Pioneers danced under the cloud-shrouded snow-capped mountains.
    After the dance, the herders invited us to sit in yurts to eat mutton eaten with hands and drink mare's milk wine, and the singing started again.
    The Kyrgyz are a nation that loves singing and dancing, and many folk songs praising the "Father of Ice Mountains" are circulating among them. They warmly invited the female mountaineers to sing and dance with them. Tibetan female team members Chama Jin, Qimi, and Chile sang Tibetan folk songs and danced Tibetan dances. Five Han Chinese female team members Zhou Yuying, Cong Zhen, Wang Guihua, and female deputy captain Yuan Yang also performed Mongolian dances and sang "Ode to Yan'an" and "Song of the Prospecting Team" at the enthusiastic invitation of the hostesses. Then, the hosts wished that the friendship between the mountaineers and the Kyrgyz herders would be as pure and eternal as the snow on the "Father of Ice Mountains."
    Friendship has been established between the mountaineers and the herders. The herders helped the mountaineering team establish a base camp, and sent many meat sheep and sour milk; female doctor Wang Yiqin, a mountaineer, also brought medicines during the festival activities to treat Kyrgyz herders.
    We played with the herders until dusk when our enthusiasm was exhausted. The herders' enthusiasm encouraged us. For the honor of all ethnic groups in our country, we are determined to plant the five-star red flag of the motherland on the summit of Muztagh Ata.
    The First Altitude
    June 19th.
    As in the usual camp life, Deputy Captain Shi Jing of the mountaineering team blew the whistle to wake everyone up at dawn. He excitedly shouted: "What a good weather! Clear skies!" The base camp immediately boiled over.
    The team has been training at the base camp for five days. Every morning, before the snow water from the mountains flows down, the team members have to climb to the Yangbulake Glacier to carry snow to melt for cooking. This activity allows the team members to quickly adapt to camp life. Yesterday, Xu Jing, the captain of the mountaineering team, announced that today they would climb the first altitude, to an altitude of 5,500 meters above sea level, for higher altitude acclimatization training, and the new team members would also conduct ice and snow operation internships there. Everyone was very happy to hear this news. From yesterday afternoon to this morning, the team members were busy preparing for the training.
    At 10:55 a.m. (equivalent to 12:55 p.m. Beijing time), the team set off towards Muztagh Ata. The climbing route is on the ridge between the Yangbulake and Kaltumak glaciers. This is the route where the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team achieved victory in 1956. Walking along the ridge, initially the ground was full of weathered gravel, and when ascending to 5,000 meters, we entered the "snow line" area. More than 20 yaks in the transport team, which live in the high mountains all year round, slowed down. Because the high altitude and lack of oxygen brought them trouble. Some of them dropped the luggage on their backs, and some used their horns to bump the master who whipped them to move forward. Later, people simply stopped hitting them and let them move forward slowly.
    It snowed on the mountain yesterday. About 100 meters away from the high-altitude camp at 5,500 meters above sea level, we would slip and fall with every step. Each team member used an ice axe to support the ground as a self-protection posture, so as to safely reach the destination. "Camp One has arrived!" A cheer of victory was issued from the team. Although we ascended one thousand meters, it took us a full five hours on the road. Because the team members had undergone a relatively long period of training and lived in the base camp at 4,500 meters above sea level for a few days, each team member had good high-altitude adaptability. Therefore, when we arrived at Camp One at 5,500 meters above sea level, everyone hardly felt uncomfortable, only the Han Chinese female team members Cong Zhen, Wang Guihua and the Tibetan female team member Chile felt a slight headache. However, they immediately used the method of active exercise and did more chores to gain high-altitude adaptability.
    The team members set up rows of tents and melted snow to make food in the snowflakes at about minus ten degrees Celsius. As night fell, the wind stopped and the snow stopped, and a starry sky appeared. (To be continued)

    登山日记
    山麓度佳节
    6月16日，库尔班节。今天早晨，队员刚起床，阿克陶县第五人民公社的柯尔克孜族牧民拉来了十五匹马，邀请队部领导同志和女子登山运动员参加他们的库尔班节。从慕士塔格山西面大本营走到北面的卡拉湖畔，骑马绕着雪山走了四个小时才到。许多汉族女同志到了慕士塔格山下，才第一次骑马，而藏族女队员骑在马上却疾驰如飞。
    库尔班节是信奉伊斯兰教的柯尔克孜牧民一年中最大的喜庆节日。卡拉湖畔一片节日欢乐的气象。柯尔克孜族妇女穿着彩红的裙衫，牧民拨弄起“库姆斯”三弦琴迎接我们。在悠扬的琴声中，一队红领巾在烟云缭绕的雪山下翩翩起舞。
    舞罢，牧民请我们坐在毡房中吃手抓羊肉，喝马乳酒，歌声又响起来了。
    柯尔克孜族是一个喜歌善舞的民族，民间流传着不少歌颂“冰山之父”的民歌。他们热情地邀请女子登山运动员对歌对舞。藏族女队员查母金、齐米和尺来便唱起了西藏民歌，跳起了西藏舞蹈。五个汉族女队员周玉瑛、丛珍、王贵华等人和女副队长袁扬也在女主人载歌载舞的盛情邀请下，向柯尔克孜族牧民表演了蒙古舞，唱了“延安颂”和“勘探队员之歌”。然后，主人祝福登山队员和柯尔克孜族牧民的友谊像“冰山之父”的积雪一般纯洁和永恒。
    登山队员和牧民之间已经建立了友谊。牧民们帮助登山队建立起了大本营基地，送来了不少肉用羊和酸奶子；登山运动员中女医生王义勤在节日活动中，也带来了药品，为柯尔克孜牧民看病。
    我们和牧民直玩到黄昏兴尽，牧民的热情鼓舞着我们。为着我国各民族的荣誉，我们抱定决心，一定要把祖国的五星红旗插上慕士塔格山顶。
    第一高度
    6月19日。
    和往常营地生活一样，登山队副队长石竞在黎明时分吹起了起床的哨音。他兴奋地喊道：“好天气呀！万里晴空！”大本营立即沸腾起来。
    大队在大本营基地已经经过了五天的锻炼。每天早晨，当山上的雪水还没有流下来的时候，队员们要攀登到洋布拉克冰河上去搬雪来化水做饭。这种活动，使得队员们很快就适应了营地生活。昨天，登山队队长许竞宣布今天要攀登第一高度，到拔海五千五百米的地方进行更高的高山适应性的锻炼，新队员还要在那里进行冰雪作业实习。听到这个消息，大家都很高兴。从昨天下午到今天早晨，队员们都在忙着进行锻炼前的准备工作。
    上午十点五十五分（相当于北京时间中午十二点五十五分），大队向慕士塔格山出发了。登山的路线是在洋布拉克和卡尔吐马克两条冰河之间的山脊上。这是1956年中、苏混合登山队取得胜利的路线。沿着山脊前进，起初脚下尽是风化碎石，上升到五千米时便进入了“雪线”地区。运输队中二十多头常年生活在高山上的牦牛，前进速度缓慢下来了。因为高山缺氧给它们带来了烦恼。它们有的摔掉背上的行囊，有的用犄角顶撞鞭打它前进的主人。后来，人们索性不打不赶，让它们慢慢前进。
    昨天山上曾经落了一次雪，在距离拔海五千五百米的高山营地一百多米远的地方，每走一步就要滑倒。每个队员都用冰镐撑地作自我保护的姿势，这样才安全地到达了目的地。“一号营地到了！”大队中发出一片胜利的欢呼声。我们虽然升高了一千米，但路上却整整走了五个小时。由于队员们经过了比较长时期的锻炼，又在拔海四千五百米的大本营基地生活了几天，每个队员都有了很好的高山适应性，因此，来到拔海五千五百米的第一号高山营地，大家几乎没有什么不舒服的感觉，只是汉族女队员丛珍、王贵华和藏族女队员尺来稍微感到头痛。但是，她们立刻用积极锻炼的办法，多作一些杂活，使自己获得高山适应性。
    队员在摄氏零下十度左右的雪花中，搭起了一列列帐篷，化雪作饭。夜幕降临了，风停雪止，天空出现了一片繁星。　（一续）
