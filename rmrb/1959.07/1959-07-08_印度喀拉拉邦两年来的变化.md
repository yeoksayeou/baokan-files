    Changes in Kerala, India, Over the Past Two Years
    Yang Yun
    In the second Indian general election announced in March 1957, the Communist Party of India won sixty seats in the 127-seat Kerala Legislative Assembly. With the support of five elected independents, it secured a majority in the State Legislative Assembly and officially formed the first Communist-led state government in India on April 5 of the same year. For more than two years, the state government has been carrying out various reforms and construction work within the scope stipulated by the Indian Constitution and central laws. Although it has been obstructed by opposition parties and sectarian forces, it has still achieved many successes with the support of the broad masses of the people.
          A Glimpse of the Past
    Kerala is a rich region that has been known as the "Treasure House of the East" since ancient times. It has abundant mineral resources: in addition to general industrial raw materials such as lignite, mica, and kaolin, it also has a large number of rare metals (such as monazite) and raw materials for the atomic industry (such as ilmenite, rutile, and zircon). It also has vast forest areas, accounting for about 25% of the state's area. Abundant fisheries can be developed around its 300-mile coastline and in most of the inland rivers suitable for fish farming. There is sufficient water conservancy and fertile soil here, and grain can be harvested twice a year. It is also suitable for developing various cash crops, and its rubber production accounts for 97% of India's total production. In short, in Kerala, with its abundant natural resources and excellent geographical conditions, the people can obtain a life of plenty.
    However, due to the long-term rule of imperialism and feudal forces in the past, Kerala's economy is very backward, and the average income of its residents is almost lower than that of any other state in India. There are many problems in the state's economic life. First, the state has a very dense population and a shortage of land (an average of 908 people per square mile, with only 0.3 acres of arable land per capita), and unreasonable land relations have aggravated the severity of the land problem. Most of the land in the state is concentrated in the hands of landlords and foreign planters, and landless or land-poor farmers account for the vast majority of the agricultural population. Feudal exploitation is extremely cruel, with rents sometimes as high as three-quarters of the total harvest. Therefore, class contradictions in Kerala's rural areas are very acute. Second, because of the extreme shortage of land in the state, only about 53% of residents can engage in agriculture, and more than 20% of the state's residents, who are hired laborers, have an average of 108 days a year without work. However, Kerala's industry is very backward and cannot absorb a large number of unemployed people. Therefore, the unemployment problem has become one of the most serious problems in the state. Third, cash crops occupy an important position in agricultural production in the state (accounting for more than two-thirds of the total value of agricultural output), and grain production cannot be self-sufficient. Every year, half of the state's grain needs to be supplied from other places and subsidized by the central government. Due to insufficient grain, grain speculation is also very serious. Fourth, Kerala's industry is backward, and foreign capital monopolizes certain important economic sectors (such as plantations and coir spinning). British planters occupy more than 250,000 acres of land, and British companies control the state's main industry—the coconut fiber industry.
    Kerala's administrative institutions were originally established by past British rulers and feudal rulers. Corruption was rampant, efficiency was low, and lower-level institutions were mostly controlled by landlords and feudal forces. The state's education system is also extremely unsound. Among the more than 7,000 private schools, more than 2,000 are controlled by the church and feudal forces, management is unreasonable, the quality of teachers is low, and the lives of faculty and staff are not guaranteed. All of this seriously hinders social progress.
    Today's Reforms and Achievements
    After the Communist-led state government was established, it immediately took a series of reform measures in response to the situation in the state. It attached particular importance to solving the land problem and promulgated a decree prohibiting the recovery of tenant land less than a week after taking office. Soon, this decree was officially enacted into law by the State Assembly. The state government also passed the Abolition of Jenmikaram (a kind of landlord system) Act, the Farmers' Debt Relief Act, and the Land Relations Act. The Land Relations Act was proposed in December 1957. After a year and a half of discussion and revision, it was passed by the State Assembly on June 10 this year. It stipulates that the maximum limit for private land is no more than 15 acres of double-cropped land or the equivalent for a family of five; for families with more than five people, one acre is added for each additional person, but the total shall not exceed 25 acres. The government pays compensation at 50% of the market price of the land for land exceeding the limit, and distributes this land to landless or land-poor farmers. The bill also stipulates a fair rent rate (one-quarter to one-sixth of the total harvest) and stipulates that landlords shall not recover tenant land without reason. This bill will soon be submitted to the President of India for approval, and its implementation will help the development of agricultural production in Kerala and improve the grain supply situation.
    The state government has taken many measures to develop production. In agriculture, in addition to trying its best to solve the land problem, it has also started to build hundreds of irrigation and flood control projects, drafted a huge plan for the comprehensive utilization of the state's forty-one rivers, and taken measures to promote advanced farming methods, improved varieties, and increased fertilizer production. In addition, the state government has also organized agricultural sales and production cooperatives and issued a large number of agricultural loans. In industry, in addition to actively developing state-owned industries, the state government has also done a lot of work in supporting private industries. Since September last year, it has convened state-wide and regional meetings of industrialists, listened to opinions on developing industries in the state, and conducted full discussions. Currently, the state government is actively preparing to assist some industrialists in establishing more than a dozen modern enterprises in the state, and to assist in the establishment of handicraft and small industrial cooperatives.
    The state government has made great efforts to protect the interests of the working people and increase the wages of workers. Over the past two years, it has increased the wages of workers in state-owned enterprises and stipulated the minimum wages for workers in various enterprise sectors and agricultural workers engaged in agricultural labor. It has also resolved many labor-management disputes through government, labor, and management consultations. Recently, it also proposed an Industrial Relations Bill, which further stipulates the legitimate rights of workers and specific methods for resolving labor-management disputes. These efforts have led to some improvement in the lives of workers and peasants. According to reports, in the past two years, the wages of workers in about fifty factories and enterprises have increased by 12.5%-50%, the wages of hired laborers have increased by 25%-50%, and the daily wages of plantation workers have increased by one-eighth of a rupee. In addition, the state government has also increased the salaries and allowances of other lower-income workers.
    In order to rectify the administrative institutions, the state government established an Administrative Reform Committee and, based on the recommendations of this committee, recently drafted the Village Panchayat Bill and the County Government Committee Bill. The purpose of these two bills is to expand the powers of these locally elected institutions in order to strengthen democracy. These bills will be discussed and passed by the State Assembly before the village panchayat elections are held in September this year. In addition, the state government has also reformed the past police system and prison system. The ministers of the state government have also reduced their salaries and allowances to promote a clean and frugal style.
    In education, the state government has made remarkable achievements. It has completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target of establishing 443 schools in the state during the Second Five-Year Plan period (1957-1961), and built 1,140 new schools. It also plans to implement compulsory education for children throughout the state within five years. A system of free lunches for primary school students has been implemented in primary schools in some areas. The Education Reform Bill, which was passed by the State Assembly, approved by the President, and scheduled to be implemented in June this year, also particularly emphasizes protecting the lives and careers of teachers and strengthening the management of schools. It stipulates that the salaries of teachers in subsidized private schools are paid directly by the government and are no longer handled by the school authorities; teachers can only be hired from the list drawn up by the Public Service Commission, and teacher qualifications are also stipulated by the government; and the state government has the right to take over any subsidized school (except for schools for ethnic minorities and Anglo-Indians).
    The achievements of the state government over the past two years are remarkable, but the state government is not satisfied with this. When summarizing this achievement, State Chief Minister Namboodiripad said: "If the opposition in this state provided more cooperation in implementing a program that everyone can accept, the Communist-led government would have been able to make much greater achievements."
    Destructive Activities of Opposition Forces
    After the establishment of the CPI-led Kerala State Government, it was attacked and obstructed by feudal reactionary forces such as the upper echelons of the Catholic Church, the Nair Service Society (a Hindu ethnic organization), foreign planters, and opposition parties such as the Congress Party, the People's Socialist Party, and the Muslim League. Since April this year, the opposition has been actively planning a movement to overthrow the state government. They used the opposition to the Education Act as an excuse to formally launch this movement and took violent actions. They set up "pickets" in government agencies, schools, and other places, and even burned schools and attacked police stations to force the state government to resign. The Chief Minister of Kerala pointed out that the opposition's movement to force the state government to resign this time is because they are afraid that the state government will implement various reforms before the next general election, which will cause huge changes in the state. CPI General Secretary Ghosh pointed out that the purpose of this movement is to allow "the central government to intervene and dissolve the Kerala State Government."
    In order to maintain social order and the interests of the people, the Kerala State Government has taken firm measures against the anti-government activities of the opposition parties and sectarian forces, based on the powers granted to it by the Constitution. It also stated that it is still willing to consult with the opposition. Chief Minister Namboodiripad also specially invited Prime Minister Nehru to visit Kerala. After visiting Kerala, Nehru believed that the activities of the opposition parties in the state were "essentially a people's uprising" and advocated holding new elections in Kerala. The Congress Central Parliamentary Board passed a corresponding resolution. The CPI Central Executive Committee has rejected this proposal, and CPI General Secretary Ghosh believes that the Congress Party's resolution calling for new elections in Kerala is dishonest.
    The people of Kerala and broad public opinion throughout India support the Kerala State Government. Masses across the country held "Kerala Week" from June 7. People in many states held demonstrations to support the Kerala State Government and oppose the illegal activities of the opposition parties and sectarian forces in the state. With the support of the people, the Kerala State Government is fully in control of the situation. However, the struggle is still ongoing.

    印度喀拉拉邦两年来的变化
    杨韫
    在1957年3月揭晓的印度第二次大选中，印度共产党在喀拉拉邦立法会议的一百二十七个议席中获得了六十个议席。由于当选的五名独立人士的支持，它获得了邦立法会议中的多数，于同年4月5日正式组成印度第一个由共产党执政的邦政府。两年多以来，邦政府在印度宪法和中央法令规定的范围内进行各种改革和建设工作，虽然遭到反对党派和教派势力的阻挠，但在广大人民的支持下，仍然取得了许多成就。
          过去的概貌
    喀拉拉邦是一个富饶之区，自古以来就被称为“东方的宝库”。它有丰富的矿藏：除褐煤和云母、陶土、石墨等一般工业原料外，还有大量的稀有金属（如单晶石）和原子工业的原料（如钛铁矿、金红石、锆石）。它还有约占全邦面积25％的广阔的森林地带。在它长达三百英里的海岸线周围和绝大部分适于养鱼的内河，可以大量发展渔业。这里有充分的水利和肥沃的土壤，粮食每年可以收获两次。这里还适于发展各种经济作物，它的橡胶产量占印度全国产量的97％。总之，在自然资源丰富和地理条件优良的喀拉拉邦，人民是可以获得丰衣足食的生活的。
    但是，由于过去帝国主义和封建势力长期统治的结果，喀拉拉邦的经济却十分落后，它的居民的平均收入几乎比印度任何邦都要低。这个邦的经济生活中存在着不少的问题。首先，这个邦的人口很稠密，土地不足（每平方英里平均有人口九百零八人，按人口平均计算每人只有耕地零点三英亩），不合理的土地关系又加重了土地问题的严重性。邦内土地多集中在地主和外国种植园主手中，无地或少地的农民在农业人口中占绝大多数。封建剥削十分残酷，地租有的高达总收成的四分之三。因此，喀拉拉邦农村中的阶级矛盾十分尖锐。其次，由于邦内土地奇缺，大约只有53％的居民可以从事农业，占全邦居民20％以上的雇农每年平均有一百零八天没有工作可做。而喀拉拉邦的工业又很落后，不能吸收大量的失业人口。因此，失业问题已成为邦内最严重的问题之一。第三，邦内农业生产中经济作物占重要地位
  （在农业总产值中占三分之二以上），粮食生产不能自给，每年邦内粮食有一半须靠外地供应和中央补助。由于粮食不足，粮食投机也很严重。第四，喀拉拉邦工业落后，外国资本垄断某些重要经济部门（如种植园、椰皮纱纺织业）。英国种植园主占有二十五万英亩以上的土地，英国公司控制了这个邦的主要工业——椰子纤维工业。
    喀拉拉邦的行政机构原是由过去英国统治者和封建统治者建立起来的，贪污盛行，效率低下，而且下层机构多为地主封建势力所把持。这个邦的教育制度也极不健全，七千多所私立学校中，有两千多所是受到教会和封建势力控制的，管理不合理，师资质量低，教职员生活没有保障。这一切都严重地阻碍着社会的进步。
    今天的改革和成就
    共产党领导的邦政府成立后，立即针对邦内的情况，采取了一系列改革措施。它特别重视土地问题的解决，在执政后不到一个星期就颁布了禁止收回佃农土地的法令，不久这项法令又由邦议会正式制订成法律。邦政府还通过了废除詹米卡拉姆（一种地主制度）法案、农民债务救济法案和土地关系法案。土地关系法案在1957年12月就已提出，经过一年半时间的讨论和修改，到今年6月10日才由邦议会通过。它规定：私有土地的最高限额是五口之家不得超过十五英亩双季作物土地或与此相当的土地；五口以上者每多一人增加一英亩，但总额不得超过二十五英亩。限额以上的土地由政府按土地市价50％付给补偿费，并把这些土地分配给无地或少地的农民。法案还规定了公平地租率（总收成的四分之一到六分之一），并规定地主不得无故收回佃户的土地。这项法案即将送交印度总统批准，它的实施将有助于喀拉拉邦农业生产的发展，粮食供应状况的改善。
    邦政府采取了许多措施来发展生产。在农业方面，除尽力解决土地问题外，还着手兴建了几百项灌溉和防洪工程，拟订了综合利用邦内四十一条河流的庞大计划，而且采取了措施推行先进耕作方法、改良品种和增加肥料生产。此外，邦政府还组织了农业销售和生产合作社，发放了大批农贷。在工业方面，邦政府除积极发展邦营工业外，还在扶助私营工业方面作了许多工作。去年9月以来，它召开了全邦性和地区性的工业家会议，听取了关于发展邦内工业问题的意见，并进行了充分的讨论。目前邦政府正积极准备协助一些工业家在邦内开办十多项现代化企业，并协助建立手工业和小型工业合作社。
    邦政府在保障劳动人民的利益和提高职工工资方面作了很大的努力。两年来，它提高了邦营企业工人的工资，并规定了各企业部门的工人和从事农业劳动的农业工人的最低工资。它还采取政府和劳资三方面协商的办法解决了许多次劳资纠纷。最近它又提出工业关系法案，进一步规定了工人的合法权利和解决劳资纠纷的具体办法。这些努力使工农生活有了一定的改善。据报道，两年来约有五十家工厂企业的工人工资提高了12.5％—50％，雇农的工资提高了25％—50％，种植园工人的每日工资提高了八分之一卢比。此外，邦政府还提高了其他收入较低的职工的薪金和津贴。
    为了整顿行政机构，邦政府成立了行政改革委员会，并根据这个委员会的建议在最近草拟了乡评议会法案和县政委员会法案。这两项法案的目的是要扩大这些地方民选机构的权力，以加强民主。这些法案将在今年9月举行乡评议会选举以前在邦议会讨论通过。另外，邦政府还对过去的警察制度和监狱制度进行了改革。邦政府的部长们还削减了自己的薪金和津贴以提倡清廉俭朴的作风。
    在教育方面，邦政府取得了显著成就。它已提前和超额完成了规定在第二个五年计划期间（1957—1961年）在邦内建立四百四十三所学校的指标，新建了一千一百四十所学校。它还计划在五年内在全邦实行儿童义务教育。在若干地区的小学内已实行了小学生吃午饭免费的制度。邦议会通过后经总统批准、定于今年6月起实施的教育改革法案，还特别强调保障教员的生活和职业，加强学校的管理。它规定：受补助的私人学校教员的薪金直接由政府发给，不再由学校当局经手；聘用教员只能从公务人员委员会拟定的名单中选聘，教员条件也由政府规定；而且邦政府有权接收任何受补助的学校（少数民族及英印混血人的学校除外）。
    两年来邦政府的成就是显著的，但是邦政府并不以此为满足。邦首席部长南布迪里巴德在总结这个成就时曾说：“如果这个邦中的反对派在执行大家都能接受的纲领方面，多提供一些合作的话，共产党领导的政府本来是能够作出大得多的成就来的。”
    反对势力的破坏活动
    印共领导的喀拉拉邦政府成立后，遭到邦内天主教上层、奈尔人服务社（印度教族组织）、外国种植园主等封建反动势力和国大党、人民社会党、穆斯林联盟等反对党派的攻击和阻挠。今年4月以来，反对派又积极策划推翻邦政府的运动。他们以反对教育法为借口，正式展开了这个运动，并且采取了暴力行动。他们在政府机关、学校等处设置“纠察人员”，甚至烧毁学校和袭击警察局，以迫使邦政府辞职。喀拉拉邦首席部长指出，反对派这次发动要邦政府辞职的运动，是由于他们害怕在下次大选前邦政府将实行各项改革，而使邦内情况发生巨大变化。印共总书记高士则指出，这个运动的目的是想让“中央政府进行干涉并解散喀拉拉邦政府”。
    喀拉拉邦政府为维持社会秩序和人民群众的利益，已根据宪法所赋予的权力，对反对党和教派势力这种反政府的活动，采取了坚决措施。它同时也表示仍愿同反对派进行协商。首席部长南布迪里巴德还特别邀请尼赫鲁总理去喀拉拉邦进行了访问。尼赫鲁访问喀拉拉邦以后认为，邦内反对党的活动“本质上是人民的奋起”，主张在喀拉拉邦重新举行选举。国大党中央议会委员会通过了相应的决议。印共中央执行委员会已拒绝了这一建议，印共总书记高士认为国大党要求喀拉拉邦举行新选举的决议是不正直的。
    喀拉拉邦人民和印度全国广泛舆论是支持喀拉拉邦政府的。全国各地群众从6月7日起举行了“喀拉拉邦周”。许多邦的人民举行了示威游行，以支持喀拉拉邦政府，并反对该邦反对党派和教派势力的违法活动。在人民的支持下，喀拉拉邦政府完全控制着局势。但是，斗争还在进行中。
