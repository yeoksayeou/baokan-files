When Early Rice is About to be Harvested
	He Youyue

	So Many Urgent Meetings

	On the afternoon of June 16th, after a rain shower, the sky suddenly cleared up. I hurriedly packed my things and set off from the city along the Changli Highway. At dusk, I arrived at my destination – the Jubao Brigade of the Quanmei Commune in Changde County. The brigade office was noisy with people, and several meetings were being held simultaneously. On the right, the general branch secretary, Lao Long, was holding one. I asked him what the meeting was about. He said that the early rice was about to be harvested, and the late rice would soon be transplanted, so he was holding the second emergency meeting to discuss "double抢 (qiang)" (rushing to harvest and rush to plant) preparations with the branch secretaries and team leaders. On the left, the women's brigade leader, Lao Li, was holding one. She said it was also an emergency meeting. It was strange, where did all these emergency meetings come from? Looking at the scene of her meeting, it didn't seem "emergency" at all: cooks in white aprons, grandmothers holding babies, little girls carrying medicine boxes... all sorts of people were there; and they were also discussing things like "when the baby wets the bedding, it should be changed," "a pot of vegetables lacks a handful of firewood," and so on.

	"Is this also an emergency meeting?" I asked Lao Li suspiciously.

	"Yes, it is precisely an emergency meeting," Lao Li said seriously, "If the living and welfare are not handled well during the 'double抢', the problem will be big!"

	As soon as she said this, I immediately understood. It turned out that this was a meeting of the "leaders" of the cooking班 (ban), nurseries, and health stations, to discuss how to improve the living and welfare during the "double抢", so that the commune members could eat better, the mothers could work with peace of mind, and everyone would not get sick. … No wonder Lao Li said it was an "emergency meeting."

	After staying in the brigade for a while, section chief Li from the work team arrived, and he took me to see the rice seedlings. Along the way, he told me: this year's early rice is a great harvest, it is estimated that the entire brigade will harvest 300,000 to 400,000 jin more grain than last year, and now each production team has prepared several large granaries. Fangqiao team has built one that can hold 400,000 jin of grain. Talking and walking, we quickly reached the edge of the rice field. Large patches of early rice fields, the 籼子 (xianzi) (awn) has come out more than half; the cadres' high-yield fields, experimental fields, and 籼子 have all come out, and have begun to droop. "East a 籼, west a 籼, twenty-five days rice on the steamer," I thought that in at most a month, in mid-July, the early rice would be harvested, and the "emergency meeting" should indeed be held.

	Complete "Double抢" in About Ten Days

	Early the next morning, Lao Xiao from the brigade took me to the Shai谷 (Shai Gu) production team. Party branch secretary Gong Tianbao was hunched over a small square table calculating on an abacus, reciting "one, three, eight," while occasionally looking at the commune members' roster. Seeing that they were busy, we didn't want to disturb them, so we sat down quietly. Suddenly, Lao Gong slammed the table and repeatedly said "Terrible!" Lao Xiao and I were startled and quickly asked what was wrong. It turned out that Lao Gong was making a "double抢" labor plan, which was to be discussed at the team cadre meeting that evening. This team has a lot of land and little labor, and after calculating, it would take more than twenty days to complete. He said: "If this is the case, I am afraid the early grain will rot in the fields, and the late seedlings will have to be transplanted by Mid-Autumn Festival." I asked him what to do? He didn't say anything. After about ten minutes of silence, Lao Gong finally came up with a solution. He said that this was also a way, to withdraw all twenty-three laborers occupied by water conservancy construction, sideline production, and grass shoe making, and there were many people growing vegetable gardens, so four or five could also be squeezed out; and changing from敞口扮桶 (chang kou ban tong) (open-mouth bucket) to 刹子桶 (shazi tong) (clutch bucket) could save one-third of the labor. By adopting these methods, the "double抢" task could be completed in seventeen days. However, Lao Gong still felt that the time was too long. He said, "Spring planting by day, summer planting by time," one day faster is better than one day slower. He will hold a cadre meeting tonight and a commune member meeting tomorrow night, so that everyone can think of ways and come up with clever ideas, and strive to complete it in about ten days.

	Artisans Busy Non-Stop

	Not far from the Shai谷 team, there are two ironwork groups of the brigade by the highway. I went in to take a look on the way. A dozen blacksmiths were all shirtless, enduring the pungent coal smoke and scorching sparks, working vigorously. The weather was hot, and the fire was fierce, the hammer-wielding, furnace-pulling, and coal-adding workers, each like a red-faced "Guan Gong", their sweat-soaked pants dripping with water. An old师傅 (shifu) (master craftsman) said to me: "In previous years, the blacksmith shop should have closed during this hot weather, but this year..."

	"What about this year?" I asked.

	"Go and see the house next door," the old师傅 said, "with so many things to repair, how can we close the shop?"

	I walked into the house next door and saw that there were rusty or missing-tooth sickles, piled up in more than a dozen piles, looking like there were more than a thousand. I asked the old师傅:

	"How long will it take to sharpen them all?"

	"The fire is singeing our eyebrows, the faster the better." He said, "In previous years, a furnace sharpened thirty or forty sickles a day, but now we have to work hard and open night shifts, and a furnace sharpens sixty sickles a day. We will sharpen the sickles by the end of the month, and then repair plows and harrows at the beginning of next month." After speaking, he went back to hammering. Lao Xiao and I started to walk out, but we were stopped by the old师傅: "Please give a message to Secretary Long, and ask the brigade to issue a notice quickly. There are still sickles from Yanping and Fangqiao production teams that have not been sent. Tell them to hurry up."

	Save the Good Stuff for "Double抢"

	At noon, we arrived at the Zhuhu production team. The commune members were eating. In the spacious and clean食堂 (shitang) (canteen), there were more than a dozen large sauce缸 (gang) (jars) in a long row, with more than a thousand jin of salted radish and pickled cucumber. I asked the women's team leader Liu Da'e: "Are these good dishes saved for the 'double抢'?" Lao Liu laughed and said, "What good dishes, just sour, everyone is tired of eating them." What a big口气 (kouqi) (tone)! I walked to the dining table and saw that they were eating bitter gourd, cowpeas, and peppers so early. I asked Lao Liu to take me to see the菜园 (caiyuan) (vegetable garden). The菜园 (caiyuan) was around the食堂 (shitang), a total of forty-four mu, and the pumpkins were as big as bowls, all over the棚 (peng) (shed) and ground; the gourd was in the big knot season, there were at least several hundred; and there were also many peppers, cowpeas, and eggplants; and there were two large watermelon fields. Lao Liu told me: these are mostly saved for the "double抢" to eat. She said: "At that time, the work will be even tighter, so we should eat some good vegetables; we also plan to catch some fish fry and shrimps, and strive to have a small meat dish once a day." She also said: by that time, the pumpkins will be as big as washbasins, dozens of jin each, so that the commune members can eat happily, and cutting rice and transplanting seedlings will be more energetic.

	Cattle Seen on Hefu Mountain

	It was getting late, and we walked out of the brigade office, stood on a small hill, and looked down at the wide fields: groups of girls and children watching cattle were urging their steeds to go home. Lao Xiao told me: this brigade has a lot of land and few cattle, and one cow has to be used as two. In order not to delay the rushing to transplant, the feeding management has been specially strengthened. The cattle are watched on the Hefu Mountain, which is full of grass. Zhuhu and other production teams have also taken out beans to feed the cattle.... As we talked, the cattle herd had long gone far away, and only two hunchbacked grandpas were closely following behind to pick up cow dung. (Originally published in the New Hunan Daily)

    在早稻将要收割的时候
    贺幼岳
    这么多紧急会议
    6月16日下午，下过一场阵雨之后，天色豁然开朗。我匆忙收拾一下，出城沿常澧公路走去。黄昏时候到了目的地——常德县全美公社的聚宝大队。大队办公室里人声喧哗，正在同时召开几个会议。右边一起是总支书记老龙开的。我问他开什么会？他说，转眼就要收割早稻了，晚稻也很快要插了，开第二次紧急会议，跟支书、队长研究“双抢”（抢收抢插）准备。左边一起是妇女大队长老李开的。她说也是开的紧急会议。真奇怪，哪来的这么些紧急会议？我看她那个会议的场面，怎么也称不上“紧急”：系白围裙的炊事员，抱小伢的老婆婆，背药箱的小妹子……，各色各样的人物都有；同时讨论的也是什么“小伢尿湿褥子该换哪”，“一锅菜少了一把火哪”，等等。
    “你这也是紧急会议？”我怀疑地问老李。
    “嗯，正是紧急会议。”老李一板正经地说：“‘双抢’期间搞不好生活福利，问题才大哩！”
    她这一说，我马上就明白了。原来这是炊事班、托儿所、保健站的“头子”会，研究如何搞好“双抢”期间的生活福利，让社员们吃得更好，让母亲们安心出工，让大伙不生病。……怪不得老李说是“紧急会议”。
    在大队待了一阵，工作组李科长来了，他领我看禾苗去。一路上他告诉我：今年早稻是个大丰收，估计全大队要比去年多收三、四十万斤谷，现在每个生产队都准备了几个大谷仓，方桥队就盖了个能装四十万斤谷的。边走边说，很快就到了稻田边。大片大片的早稻田，籼子（穗子）出了半数以上；干部的丰产田、试验田、籼子已经出齐，开始低头散子了。“东一籼，西一籼，二十五天饭上甑”，我想顶多有一个月，7月中旬就要收割早稻了，“紧急会议”的确该开了。
    十天左右搞完“双抢”
    第二天一清早，大队老萧带我到晒谷生产队。党支部书记龚天保正伏在一张小方桌上敲算盘，口里“一个，三个，八个”地念着，时而又看看社员花名册。我们看人家正在忙着，不便打扰，于是不声不响地坐下来。忽然老龚把桌子一拍，接连几个
  “不得了！”我和老萧都吓了一跳，连忙问是什么事。原来老龚正在作“双抢”劳力规划，当晚召开的队干部会上要讨论。这个队田多劳力少，七算八算总要二十多个日子才搞得完。他说：“要是这个架势，只怕早谷会烂在田里，晚秧要插到中秋。”我问他怎么办？他不作声。大概静默了十多分钟，老龚终于拿出办法来了。他说，这也是办法，把修水利、搞副业、打草鞋占用的二十三个劳力全部抽出来，种菜园的人多，也可挤出四、五个；改敞口扮桶为刹子桶，能节省劳力三分之一。采用这些办法，“双抢”任务有十七天就能完成。但是，老龚还嫌时间太长，他说“春插日，夏插时”，快一天就胜一天，今晚上开个干部会，明晚开个社员会，让大伙想办法、出巧计，争取在十天左右搞完。
    手艺工人忙不停
    离晒谷队不远，公路边有大队的两个铁业组。我顺路进去看看。十来个铁匠师傅，全都光着上身，耐着刺鼻的煤烟和灼人的火花，劲鼓鼓地工作着。天气热，火又猛，掌锤的、扯炉的、添煤的，一个个像红脸“关公”，汗湿了的半截裤子拧得出水。一个老师傅对我说：“往年这个热天，铁匠铺早就该关门了，可是今年……”
    “今年怎么样？”我问。
    “你到隔壁房子里去看看吧”，老师傅说：“看那么多东西要修，关了门怎么行？”
    我走到隔壁房子里一看，原来都是些生了锈或缺了齿的镰刀，一堆堆地摆着十多起，看样子足有千多把。我问老师傅：
    “要好久才能铣完？”
    “火烧眉毛尖了，越快越得劲。”他说：“往年一个炉子一天铣三、四十把，而今要鼓干劲，开夜班，一个炉子一天铣六十把，月尾铣完镰刀，下月初再修犁耙。”说完他又打锤去了。我和老萧动身往外走，刚提脚就被老师傅喊住了：“请搭个信给龙书记，要大队赶快发个通知，还有岩坪、方桥几个生产队的镰刀没送来，要他们性急点。”
    好的留到“双抢”吃
    中午到了朱湖生产队。社员们正在吃饭。宽阔、整洁的食堂里，一长条摆着十多个大酱缸，盐萝卜、酸黄瓜足有千多斤。我问女队长刘大娥：“这些好菜都是留到‘双抢’吃的吗？”老刘噗嗤一笑，说：“什么好菜，精酸的，大伙都吃厌了。”好大的口气！我走到餐桌面前一看，他们这么早就吃苦瓜、豆角、辣椒了。我要老刘带我看看菜园去。菜园就在食堂周围，总共四十四亩，南瓜有钵子大一个了，满棚满地都是；壶瓜是大结的时候了，少也有了几百个；辣椒、豆角、茄子也结了好多；还有两大块西瓜地。老刘告诉我：这些大都是留到“双抢”吃的。她说：“到那个时候工夫更紧了，应当吃些好水菜；还打算捞些鱼崽虾子，争取一天开次小荤。”她还说：等到那个时候，南瓜都有脸盆大了，一个几十斤，让社员吃个欢，割稻插秧更有劲。
    看牛上了河洑山
    天色不早了，我们走出大队办公室，站在一座小丘上，俯视宽阔的田野：一群群看牛的姑娘、伢伢，正催动胯下坐骑，的的达达往家里走。老萧告诉我：这个大队田多牛少，一头牛要顶两头用，为了不误抢插，特别加强了饲养管理，看牛都上了青草漫野的河洑山，朱湖等几个生产队还拿出豆儿给牛吃……。说着说着，牛群早去远了，只有两个驼背爷爷紧跟在后面捡牛粪。　（原载新湖南报）
