Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 7th: The delegation of the Korean Red Cross, which is negotiating with the delegation of the Japanese Red Cross on the issue of repatriating Korean residents in Japan, issued a statement here on the evening of the 7th, saying that the Japanese side must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from delaying the signing of the agreement already reached by both parties.

The talks between the Korean and Japanese sides began in Geneva on April 13th, and the work of drafting the various documents of the agreement concluded on June 24th.

According to a statement made by the Korean spokesperson at a press conference on the evening of the 7th, the Korean delegation formally suggested to the Japanese delegation on June 27th that it sign the agreement, which was "the sole task of the talks between the two sides." The statement said that the Japanese delegation did not agree to the Korean delegation's suggestion, and said that it could only sign after obtaining the "consent" of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in advance.

The statement pointed out that this action by the Japanese delegation was a blatant betrayal of the promises it made during the talks and a complete violation of the content and spirit of the agreement already reached by both parties.

The Korean side has repeatedly pointed out that the signing and entry into force of the agreement must not depend on whether the International Committee of the Red Cross "agrees" to this matter. The statement said that there is not a single word in the articles of the agreement reached by both parties that mentions that the agreement can only be signed and take effect after the International Committee of the Red Cross "agrees." According to usual practice, the signing of the agreement by both parties without delay and obtaining the "consent" of the International Committee of the Red Cross are two completely different things.

The statement said that the real reason for the Japanese side's evasion and delay in signing the agreement is that Japan lacks sincerity in repatriating Korean residents in Japan as soon as possible. The statement pointed out that the Japanese side's insistence on obtaining the "consent" of the International Committee of the Red Cross is "a premeditated action, aimed at shifting all responsibility to the International Committee of the Red Cross, thereby concealing their insincere attitude and attempting to justify this attitude."

The Korean delegation requested the Japanese Red Cross delegation to show sincerity on the issue of the return of Korean residents in Japan, and said, "Whenever the Japanese side expresses its willingness to sign, we will immediately respond." The Korean Red Cross delegation will depart for home on the 8th, leaving two people in Geneva to be responsible for liaison work in this regard.

### 朝鲜红十字会代表团发表声明  日方拖延签订协议阻挠朝侨归国

    朝鲜红十字会代表团发表声明
    日方拖延签订协议阻挠朝侨归国
    新华社日内瓦7日电　同日本红十字会代表团谈判旅日朝侨回国问题的朝鲜红十字会代表团7日晚间在这里发表声明说，日本方面必须对由于拖延在双方已经达成的协议上签字而产生的一切后果负完全责任。
    朝日双方会谈是4月13日在日内瓦开始的，6月24日结束起草协议的各项文件的工作。
    据朝方发言人7日晚在记者招待会上发表声明说，朝鲜代表团6月27日正式建议日本代表团签署这个协定，这是“双方会谈的唯一任务”。声明说，但是日本代表团没有答应朝鲜代表团的建议，并且说只有在事先得到红十字国际委员会的“同意”后它才能签字。
    声明指出，日本代表团的这种行动是公开背弃了它在会谈期间所作的诺言，并且完全违反了双方已达成的协议的内容和精神。
    朝鲜方面一再指出，协议的签字及其生效，决不能看红十字国际委员会是否“同意”这个问题而定。声明说，在双方达成的协议条文中，只字没有提到只有在红十字国际委员会“同意”后，这个协议才能签字和生效。按照通常的惯例，双方毫不拖延地签订协议，和获得红十字国际委员会的“同意”，完全是两件不同的事情。
    声明说，日方回避和拖延签署协议的真正原因是，日本没有诚意及早遣返旅日朝侨。声明指出，日方坚持要取得红十字国际委员会的“同意”的作法是“一种预谋的行动，目的是要把全部责任推给红十字国际委员会，从而掩盖它们的无诚意的态度，并企图为这种态度辩解。”
    朝鲜代表团要求日本红十字会代表团在使旅日朝侨归国问题上表现诚意，并且说，“日方什么时候表示愿意签字，我们将立即给予回答”。朝鲜红十字会代表团将在8日启程归国，在日内瓦将留下二人负责这方面的联络工作。
