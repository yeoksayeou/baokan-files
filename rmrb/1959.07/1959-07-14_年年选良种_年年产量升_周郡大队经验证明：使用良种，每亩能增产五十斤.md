Guangzhou, July 13th (by our reporter) Despite the impact of the extraordinary floods and rainstorms in June, only 400 mu of the 7,300 mu of early rice in the Zhoujun Production Brigade of Tangxia Commune in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, were flattened. What's the reason? It turns out that this production brigade has consistently and resolutely cultivated and promoted good seeds for several years, avoiding lodging and increasing yields year after year.

    The early rice varieties planted by the Zhoujun Brigade this year on a large scale include several types: Dwarf Zhan, Indica Rice 4105, 549, 518, Dwarf Leg Nant, and Guangchang 13. Dwarf Zhan has short and thick stems, and is resistant to fertilizer, so it is not afraid of wind and rain. This year, 743 mu were planted, and only a fraction of the direct seeding lodged. Indica Rice 549, although tall and susceptible to wind, has stems as thick as penholders, making it equally resistant to lodging; its grains are dense, and its ears are long, with yields similar to Dwarf Zhan, averaging 480 jin per mu. Indica Rice 4105, of medium height, and Dwarf Leg Nant, with stems as short and thick as Dwarf Zhan but maturing earlier, were also mostly unaffected by lodging. A field of flattened seedlings was Guangchang 13, which the brigade has decided to eliminate next year.

        Seed Enthusiasts
    Continuously replacing old varieties with new improved varieties has become a system in Zhoujun Brigade. For example, in 1954, everyone considered White Glutinous Rice a good variety. However, after comparative experiments, they found that Nant 16, Xuanzhan, and Xuanban 305 were better, so in 1956 they replaced White Glutinous Rice with these three varieties. In 1956, they discovered that Guangchang 13 was even better than these three varieties, and by 1957, they replaced the three varieties with Guangchang 13. And now, it's Guangchang 13's turn to be eliminated. Because of this, they have earned the title of "Seed Enthusiasts." The reason they are so enthusiastic is that years of practice have proven that under the same natural conditions and cultivation measures, using new improved varieties can yield an additional 50 to 80 jin of grain per mu.

    Resolute Attitude, Reliable Steps
    Their attitude towards promoting improved varieties is active and resolute; however, the steps are very sound and reliable. All foreign varieties must undergo rigorous testing, demonstration, and identification. Only when it is certain that they are suitable for local growth and are indeed better than the old varieties, will they be promoted on a large scale. The fifteen-mu experimental field is responsible for this testing, demonstration, and identification work. These experiments allow them to avoid conservatism when selecting and promoting improved varieties, while also minimizing subjective blindness. For example, regarding japonica rice, when people were generally denouncing japonica rice, they tested more than 200 japonica rice varieties in their field. After careful observation, they found that varieties from North Korea, the Northeast, and Shanxi, which had not been purified through local cultivation for many years, generally had weaker heat resistance and were not suitable for planting; varieties from the Yangtze River basin generally had stronger heat resistance than those from the north, but there were still many unresolved problems in cultivation techniques, requiring further testing and research, and were not suitable for promotion for the time being; japonica rice seeds from Taiwan were more suitable for the region's growth and had relatively high yields. Therefore, they opposed the wholesale rejection of japonica rice and believed that japonica rice had outstanding advantages such as being resistant to lodging and strong against wind, making it most suitable for growing in areas along rivers, near the sea, and with frequent winds and rains. They decided to select improved varieties that have been tested, and start trial planting a portion on a large scale next year.

    Establish a Seed Specialization Team
    Experimentation, identification, breeding, and promotion – this is the formula that the Zhoujun Brigade has consistently adhered to in promoting improved varieties for several years. After the experimental field completes the experimentation and identification work, the task of breeding is handed over to a specialized seed team. This seed team consists of thirty experienced, research-interested, and meticulous elderly farmers and young people. The seed breeding fields are also fixed, and they choose fields that are neither too fertile nor too lean, with sufficient sunlight, easy irrigation, no historical diseases, and representative of the brigade for breeding. During the breeding process, management is particularly meticulous, striving to minimize disease and prevent disease; from heading to maturity, three rounds of removing impurities and culling inferior plants are also carried out to ensure that the seeds produced reach a purity of over 98%. After removing impurities and culling inferior plants, the strongest part is selected and kept for breeding next year, while the rest is harvested as a whole to supply large areas of paddy fields. The harvested seeds also have separate drying yards for drying and threshing, and special seed warehouses for storage. Since the establishment of the seed team, the masses have praised, "In the past, rice matured three generations together (meaning the seeds were mixed and matured unevenly), but now rice matures all at the same level!"

    Experience in Promotion
    During large-scale promotion, they also have two experiences: one is the combination of small-scale breeding and large-field propagation, and the other is the combination of small-plot comparison and large-area demonstration. According to their years of experience, the growth conditions of a variety often differ between small-scale planting and large-scale planting, and the growth conditions of the same variety also vary in different regions and environments. Therefore, only by using these two methods for repeated comparison can they ensure foolproof results. Another experience is the combination of research by specialists and evaluation by the masses. Before harvesting, cadres, elderly farmers, and the masses are organized to observe the fields together, study, discuss, compare, and identify together, and jointly decide what varieties to adopt and how much to promote. In this way, the opinions of cadres and the masses are easily aligned, and the promotion work is easily supported by the masses. Now, the seed work of Zhoujun Brigade has become a banner in Xinhui County, and the county's communes have convened on-site seed work conferences here to promote their experience. (Attached picture)

    年年选良种　年年产量升
    周郡大队经验证明：使用良种，每亩能增产五十斤
    本报广州13日电　经历了6月间特大洪水和暴风雨的袭击，广东省新会县棠下公社周郡生产大队七千三百多亩早稻倒伏的只有四百亩。原因何在呢？原来这个生产大队几年来一贯坚决培育和推广良种，避免了倒伏，产量年年上升。
    周郡大队今年大面积种植的早稻品种，有矮仔占、籼稻4105、549、518、矮脚南特和广场13等几种。矮仔占茎短而粗，又耐肥，风来雨打都不怕。今年种了七百四十三亩，只有一分直播的倒伏。籼稻549，虽然长得高，易受风，但茎秆像笔杆一样粗，同样不易倒伏；它的谷粒密，穗子长，产量和矮仔占差不多，平均每亩有四百八十斤。中等身材的籼稻4105和茎秆像矮仔占一样又矮又粗但比矮仔占早熟的矮脚南特，这些品种绝大部分也没有倒伏。一片倒伏了的禾苗是广场13，大队已决定明年把它淘汰掉。
        种子迷
    不断更换新的良种，在周郡大队已经成为一种制度。例如1954年，大家认为白谷糯是良种。但他们比较试验的结果，发现南特16号、宣占、选半305等比它好，到1956年他们便换上这三个品种，把白谷糯淘汰掉。1956年，他们发现广场13比这三个品种更好，到1957年，他们又用广场13把这三个品种代替了。而现在，又轮到广场13要被淘汰了。因为这个缘故，他们有了“良种迷”的称号。而他们所以这样着迷，是因为几年来的实践证明：在自然条件、耕作措施相同的情况下，使用新的良种，每亩地可以多收五十至八十斤粮。态度坚决　步骤可靠
    他们推广良种的态度，是积极而又坚决的；但步骤却是十分稳妥、可靠。凡是外来的良种，一定要经过严格的试验、表证、鉴定，肯定是适宜本地生长而且确实是比旧种好，才放手大面积推广。而负责这种试验、表证和鉴定工作的，是十五亩地的试验场。这种试验，使他们在选择和推广良种的时候，既不致陷于保守，又可尽量减少主观盲目性。就如对粳稻来说，当人们一片叫喊粳稻要不得的时候，他们场里试验了二百多个粳稻的品种，经过细心观察，结果他们发现：来自朝鲜、东北、山西等地区的品种，又未经过本地多年栽培纯化的，抗热力一般比较弱，不适宜种植；来自长江流域的品种，耐热力一般比来自北方的强，但在栽培技术上，还有不少问题未解决，有待进一步试验研究，暂时不宜推广；来自台湾的粳稻种，则比较适宜本地区的生长，而且产量比较高。所以他们反对把粳稻一概否定，并且认为粳稻有不易倒伏、抗风力强等突出的优点，最适合沿河、靠海、多风多雨的地区生长。他们决定选择经过试验的良种，明年开始大面积试种一部分。
  建立种子专业队
    试验、鉴定、繁育、推广，这是周郡大队几年来在推广良种工作中坚持不变的公式。在试验场完成了试验、鉴定的工作之后，繁育的任务就交给专业的种子队。这个种子队由三十个具有生产经验、有研究兴趣、工作细心的老农和青年组成。育种田也是固定的，他们选择不太肥不太瘦、阳光充足、灌溉容易、无历史性病害和在本队有代表性的田来培育。育种过程中，管理工作特别细致，力求少生病害和不生病害；从抽穗到成熟，还进行三次除杂去劣的工作，保证培育出来的种籽达到98％以上的纯度。除杂去劣后，再穗选其中最壮的一部分留作明年育种，其余整片收割下来供给大面积的稻田用。收刈下来的种子，还有单独的晒场晒打和专门的种子仓库保管。自从有了种子队以后，群众称赞说：“过去禾熟三代同堂（意思是种子杂，成熟不一），现在禾熟一级齐！”
      推广的经验
    在大面积推广的时候，他们还有两个经验：一个是小量培育与大田繁殖相结合，小区比较与大面积表证相结合。根据他们多年的体会，一个品种在小面积种植和大面积种植的生长情况常常有所差别，同一品种在不同的地区和不同的环境下生长情况也往往有所不同，因此只有采用这两个方法反复比较对照，才能保证万无一失。再一个经验是专人研究与群众评选相结合。收刈前，组织干部、老农、群众到田里观看，共同研究、讨论、对比、鉴定，共同决定采用什么种，推广多少。这样，干部和群众的意见容易一致，推广工作也容易获得群众支持。现在，周郡大队的种子工作已经成为新会县的一面旗帜，全县的公社曾在这里召开了种子工作现场会议，推广他们的经验。（附图片）
