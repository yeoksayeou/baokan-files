Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 27th: Indian Communist Party General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh stated in a talk to the press today that the failures suffered by the opposition parties in Kerala have driven them to frenzy. They "are now threatening to create a terrible tragedy," demanding central intervention to overthrow the Communist-led state government. He strongly condemned the opposition parties' plan to hold a demonstration in Trivandrum on August 9th.

He said that they have decided to carry out provocations on a larger scale. He said that this provocation plan "was only formulated after Mrs. Sucheta Kripalani, General Secretary of the Congress Party, arrived in Kerala."

Commenting on Mrs. Indira Gandhi, President of the Congress Party's speech on the 25th, he said, "It seems almost as if the President of the Congress Party and her colleagues in Kerala are acting according to a carefully prepared plan." He said that Debar and certain other leaders of the Congress Party "have been trying to overthrow the Kerala government for the past two years."

Ghosh condemned the unconstitutional tactics and methods plotted by Congress Party leaders under the banner of anti-communism. He warned, "If such tactics and methods are allowed to succeed, it will be a grave danger to the country and to the Congress Party itself."

Ghosh asked Prime Minister Nehru to state his views on the Congress Party's tactics in Kerala.

He also said that the powerful demonstrations against central intervention in Kerala, to be held on August 3rd in all states of India, will make Congress Party leaders understand that a powerful force will not tolerate their attempts to stifle democracy.

When asked by a reporter about the possibility of central intervention, Ghosh replied, "According to our constitution, I don't see how they can intervene." He emphasized that, apart from the recommendations stated in the resolutions of our National Committee, "we absolutely will not make new proposals" to resolve the crisis.

According to today's Indian newspapers, Congress Party leaders have held a series of high-level talks in the past two days to discuss the Kerala issue.

According to the Press Trust of India, Congress Party President Indira Gandhi told reporters after meeting President Prasad on the 25th that "the central government should have taken action on Kerala long ago." She later emphasized at a public gathering that immediate action must be taken. She also said, "If the constitution does not provide remedies for the people of Kerala, then the constitution should be amended."

Mrs. Kripalani, General Secretary of the Congress Party, has been sent to Kerala by the Congress Party Central Committee. According to the Press Trust of India, the purpose of her trip is to "strengthen the agitation movement in Kerala to provide background music for the debate in the People's House."

Since the Communist Party National Committee firmly rejected the proposal to demand new elections, the agitation against the state government, which had once subsided in Kerala, has become active again. The "Indian Express" reported that shortly after Padmanabhan, the leader of the so-called Kerala "Liberation Struggle Committee," returned to Kerala from Delhi, the "Committee" decided to launch a so-called "struggle to save India" from August 9th, in order to stir up a larger-scale agitation movement to overthrow the Kerala government. Various opposition parties will participate in this action.

At the same time, public opinion throughout India has expressed opposition to central intervention and unconstitutional actions. The Press Trust of India reported yesterday that more than 60,000 people in West Bengal signed a petition to defend the Kerala government, and more than 100 trade unions and other organizations submitted resolutions to the President supporting the Kerala government. According to the Indian News Agency, more than 80,000 workers in Andhra Pradesh went on strike on the 21st to support the Kerala government. The Press Trust of India also reported that last week, students held a large-scale march on the streets of Calcutta, holding banners saying "No intervention in Kerala." Eighty-nine leading lawyers in Calcutta opposed the demand to overthrow the Kerala government, and 400 representatives of the Catholic Church in Kerala held a meeting last week demanding that the central government resolve the situation in Kerala through negotiations.

Large-scale demonstrations will be held in various states of India on August 3rd to support the Kerala government.

    高士谴责推翻喀拉拉邦政府的图谋
    指出国大党策划破坏宪法的做法十分危险
    据新华社新德里27日电　印度共产党总书记阿约艾·高士在今天向报界发表的谈话中指出，喀拉拉邦的反对党所遭受到的失败使他们变得疯狂起来，他们“现在扬言要制造可怕的悲剧”，要求中央进行干涉，推翻共产党执政的邦政府。他强烈谴责反对党打算8月9日在特里凡得琅举行示威。
    他说，它们决定以更大的规模进行挑衅。他说，这项挑衅计划“只是在国大党总书记苏契塔·克里怕拉尼夫人到达喀拉拉邦以后制定出来的。”
    他在评论国大党主席英迪拉·甘地夫人25日的谈话时说：“看来几乎是，国大党主席以及她在喀拉拉邦的同僚是按照一项仔细准备的计划而行事的。”他说，德巴和国大党的其他某些领袖“过去两年来一直在设法推翻喀拉拉邦政府。”
    高士指责国大党领袖在反共名义下所策划的破坏宪法的策略和方法。他警告说，“如果允许这种策略和方法得逞，对国家和对国大党本身来说这都是严重的危险。”
    高士要求尼赫鲁总理说明他对国大党在喀拉拉邦的策略的看法。
    他又说，8月3日在印度全国各邦举行的反对中央干涉喀拉拉邦的强大示威将使国大党领袖明白，强大的力量将不能容忍他们扼杀民主的企图。
    有记者问起中央干涉的可能性，高士回答说，“按照我们的宪法，我看不出他们如何能够进行干涉。”他强调说，除了我们全国委员会的决议中所陈述的建议以外，“我们绝对不提出新的建议”来解决危机。
    据今天的印度的报纸报道，在过去两天内，国大党领袖接连举行高级会谈讨论喀拉拉邦问题。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，国大党主席英迪拉·甘地在25日会见普拉沙德总统后对记者们说，“中央早就应当对喀拉拉邦采取行动了。”她后来在一个公共集会上讲话时强调必须立即采取行动。她并且说，“如果宪法对喀拉拉邦人民没有补救办法，那末应当修改宪法。”
    国大党总书记克里帕拉尼夫人已被国大党中央派往喀拉拉邦。据印度报业托辣斯报道，她此行目的是要“加强喀拉拉邦的煽动运动为人民院的辩论陪衬音乐。”
    自从共产党全国委员会坚决拒绝要求重新举行选举的意见以来，喀拉拉邦境内一度消沉下去的反对邦政府的煽动活动显得又活跃起来。“印度快报”报道，所谓喀拉拉邦“解放斗争委员会”的首领帕德马纳班从德里回到喀拉拉邦后不久，这个“委员会”就决定从8月9日起发动一个所谓“挽救印度的斗争”，以掀起更大规模的煽动运动，推翻喀拉拉邦政府。各反对党将参加这一行动。
    与此同时，印度各地舆论纷纷表示反对中央采取干涉和违反宪法的行动。印度报业托辣斯昨天报道，在西孟加拉邦有六万多人签名维护喀拉拉邦政府，有一百多个工会和其它的组织向总统递交支持喀拉拉邦政府的决议。据印度新闻社报道，安得拉邦有八万多工人在21日罢工来支持喀拉拉邦政府。印度报业托辣斯还报道，在上星期，学生在加尔各答的街道上举行了大规模的游行，他们手持“不准干涉喀拉拉邦”的标语。加尔各答八十九名主要的律师反对推翻喀拉拉邦政府的要求，喀拉拉邦天主教会的四百名代表上周举行会议，要求中央政府通过谈判来解决喀拉拉邦的局势。
    印度各邦将在8月3日举行大规模的示威来支持喀拉拉邦政府。
