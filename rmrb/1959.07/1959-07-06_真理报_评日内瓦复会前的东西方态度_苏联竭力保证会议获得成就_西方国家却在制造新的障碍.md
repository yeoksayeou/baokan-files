Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 5th: "Pravda" foreign affairs commentator Naumov wrote today, commenting on the upcoming second stage of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference: Everyone is clear that the outcome of this meeting will depend in many ways on how the participants use the recess and what they do during these days.

The author said that the Soviet government is making every effort to ensure the success of the meeting and has once again explained its position on the issues discussed by the foreign ministers. World opinion is very satisfied with Gromyko's recent statement. British newspapers unanimously pointed out that the "friendly tone" of the Soviet Foreign Minister's statement and the Soviet side's clear expression of its desire to reach an agreement make the prospects for the Geneva meeting more hopeful.

Commenting on the activities of Western countries during these days, the commentator pointed out that everyone knows that U.S. Secretary of State Herter's first action was to deliver a speech in which he made ulterior motives in explaining the negotiation process and the Soviet Union's position at the meeting.

The commentator also reminded that some other steps have been taken that will not promote the success of the Geneva conference in any way. In this regard, he cited the fact that the U.S. Congress has begun to discuss agreements that the United States has concluded and that the President has requested to ratify regarding the provision of nuclear weapons to other countries, primarily West Germany.

Western public opinion is uneasy about De Gaulle's trip to Italy. French diplomats in Geneva are colluding with Bonn in every way, and everyone knows that Bonn is single-mindedly trying to disrupt the meeting. Public opinion believes that the French leader's visit to Italy is an attempt to activate the notorious "Bonn-Paris-Rome" triangle in order to create new obstacles in the work of the foreign ministers.

Naumov went on to write that those in Bonn who oppose easing international tensions have been rampant recently. The West German presidential election in West Berlin is their crowning achievement in their sabotage activities. This is a crude provocation that can only once again emphasize how necessary it is to eliminate West Berlin as a source of tension and conflict as soon as possible.

Naumov believes that in the time before the resumption of the Geneva conference, Western activists can still do a lot to improve the international atmosphere and promote the work of the foreign ministers. This is also what their own people expect of them.

    “真理报”评日内瓦复会前的东西方态度
    苏联竭力保证会议获得成就
    西方国家却在制造新的障碍
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：“真理报”外交评论员瑙莫夫今天在评论即将到来的日内瓦外长会议第二阶段时写道：每个人都很清楚，这次会议的结局如何在很多方面将取决于会议参加者如何利用休会时间，他们在这些日子里做些什么事情。
    作者说，苏联政府竭力保证会议有所成就，又一次解释了它对外长们所讨论的问题的立场。世界舆论对葛罗米柯不久前发表的声明感到十分满意。英国报纸一致指出，苏联外长声明的“友好口吻”以及苏联方面明确表示要达成协议的愿望，使日内瓦会议的前景更有希望。
    评论员谈到西方国家在这些日子里的活动时指出，大家知道，美国国务卿赫脱的第一个行动是发表了一篇演说，在演说中对谈判的过程和苏联在会议上的立场作了别有用心的说明。
    评论员还提醒，已经有人采取了无论如何也不会促进日内瓦会议取得成就的其他一些步骤。在这方面他举出了这样一个事实，美国国会已经开始讨论美国已经缔结并且由总统提出要求批准的关于向其他国家、首先是向西德提供核武器的协定。
    西方公众对戴高乐的意大利之行感到不安。法国外交家在日内瓦在一切方面同波恩狼狈为奸，大家知道，波恩一心只想破坏会议。舆论认为，法国领导人访问意大利是企图使臭名远扬的“波恩—巴黎—罗马”三角行动起来，以便在外长们的工作中制造新障碍。
    瑙莫夫接着写道，波恩反对缓和国际紧张局势的人最近正在猖獗活动。在西柏林进行西德总统选举乃是他们捣乱活动的得意之作。这是一种粗暴的挑衅行为，它只能再一次着重表明，尽快消除西柏林这个紧张和冲突的策源地是多么必要。
    瑙莫夫认为，在日内瓦会议复会前的时间内，西方国家活动家还能在改善国际气氛和促进外长们的工作方面做很多事情。这也是他们本国人民所期望于他们的。
