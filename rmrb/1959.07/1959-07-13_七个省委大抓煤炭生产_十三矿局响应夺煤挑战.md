Xinhua News Agency, July 12th: Coal mine workers across the country are enthusiastically responding to the initiatives proposed by the Jingxi, Huainan, Fushun, Fuxin, and Kailuan Mining Bureaus. A new production upsurge is rapidly forming on the coal industry front. A responsible person from the Ministry of Coal Industry made this assessment of the current situation on the coal industry front at a telephone conference held on the 11th.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Coal Industry spoke at the meeting about the response of coal mines across the country to the initiatives proposed by the five coal mines, including Jingxi, and the situation of various provinces organizing a new production upsurge in the coal industry. The seven mining bureaus of Jiaozuo, Hebi, Xuzhou, Jingxing, Shuangyashan, Benxi, and Liaoyuan have jointly submitted challenge letters to the five mining bureaus including Jingxi. They are determined to achieve "red every ten days, red every month, and high output on all fronts" under the conditions of high output, high quality, high efficiency, low cost, and low material consumption quotas, and resolutely guarantee the overfulfillment of the state production tasks for the third quarter. These seven mines also put forward specific measures for achieving their plans. The Jiaozuo Municipal Party Committee and the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau organized cadres to go deep into the mines on the 6th to mobilize the masses and organize a production upsurge; on the 7th and 8th, each mine held employee representative conferences to mobilize the overfulfillment of the third quarter production plan. From the 1st to the 7th, the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau overfulfilled its coal production plan by 180 tons, and the tunneling work also overfulfilled its plan. The Fengfeng Mining Bureau also held a general employee representative conference, deciding to respond to the initiative of the Jingxi and other mining bureaus, and discussed measures to complete the third quarter production tasks.

The provinces of Shanxi, Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Henan have deployed work to organize a province-wide coal production upsurge. Shanxi Province held a telephone conference on the 10th. The six mining bureaus of Datong, Yangquan, Fenxi, Xishan, Xuangang, and Lu'an also put forward challenge conditions to the five mining bureaus including Jingxi. The responsible comrade of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee convened cadres participating in the provincial coal mine cadre meeting to discuss the issue of increasing coal production. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee proposed that the province should increase coal production by more than one million tons this year in addition to completing the state plan. The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee recently convened a meeting of municipal party secretaries and mining bureau chiefs to further unify ideological understanding on increasing coal production and resolved some material supply issues for the 17,000 sets of ball bearings urgently needed for current coal production. The responsible comrade of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee also personally grasped coal production and resolved some important issues. The secretary and other responsible comrades of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee recently went to the Huainan Coal Mine to guide the organization of a new production upsurge. The Henan Provincial Party Committee has made resolutions on the supply of materials and equipment for coal production to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the annual coal production plan this year. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee is holding a seven-level cadre meeting of coal mines to listen to the opinions of cadres at all levels and make resolutions on how to solve the current problems existing in the coal mines.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Coal Industry said that in order to quickly organize a new production upsurge, all coal mines must quickly hand over the current situation, tasks, and plans to the masses for discussion and formulate specific measures. The work of organizing a new production upsurge should currently focus on five areas: grasping political and ideological work and mass movements, grasping the supply of equipment and materials and equipment maintenance, grasping the lives of workers, grasping technological innovation and technological revolution, and grasping specific measures and typical experiences. The Ministry of Coal Industry called on the leading cadres of all coal mines to carry forward the spirit and style of eating, living, and working together with the workers, and one-quarter to one-third of the cadres should work with the workers every day. This will better encourage the workers' production enthusiasm, specifically understand and promptly handle problems in production, and rapidly push the campaign to increase production and practice economy on the coal industry front to a new climax.

Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo attended the telephone conference and spoke on the current coal and steel production issues. The meeting was attended by the directors of coal industry departments and bureaus of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, cadres of key coal mines across the country, and the secretaries of the provincial party committees in charge of industrial management in the seven provinces with relatively high coal and steel production. These seven provinces are Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Henan.

    七个省委大抓煤炭生产 
    十三矿局响应夺煤挑战
    煤炭工业部要求作好当前五项工作
    政治思想工作和群众运动，设备材料供应和检修，工人生活，技术革新和技术革命，具体措施和典型经验
    据新华社12日讯　全国各地煤矿职工热烈地响应京西、淮南、抚顺、阜新和开滦矿务局提出的倡议，煤炭工业战线上一个新的生产高潮正在迅速形成。煤炭工业部负责人在11日召开的电话会议上，对当前煤炭工业战线的形势作了这样的估计。
    煤炭工业部负责人在会上讲到了全国各煤矿响应京西等五个煤矿提出的倡议的情况和各省组织煤炭工业新的生产高潮的情况。焦作、鹤壁、徐州、井陉、双鸭山、本溪和辽源七个矿务局，已经向京西等五个矿务局联合提出了应战书。他们决心在高产、高质、高效率和成本低、材料消耗定额低的条件下，做到“旬旬红、月月红，面面高产”，坚决保证超额完成第三季度的国家生产任务。这七个矿还提出了他们实现计划的具体措施。中共焦作市委和焦作矿务局六日已组织干部深入各矿井发动群众，组织生产高潮；七、八日两天，各矿都召开了职工代表大会，动员超额完成第三季度生产计划。双鸭山矿务局一至七日煤炭的生产超额一百八十吨完成了生产计划，掘进工作也超额完成了计划。峰峰矿务局也举行了全局的职工代表大会，决定响应京西等矿务局的倡议，讨论了完成三季度生产任务的措施。
    山西、山东、黑龙江、河南等省，已经部署了组织全省煤炭生产高潮的工作。山西省十日召开了电话会议。大同、阳泉、汾西、西山、轩岗和路安六个矿务局也向京西等五个矿务局提出了应战条件。中共山西省委负责同志召集正在参加全省煤矿干部会议的干部，座谈了煤炭的增产问题。山西省委提出，全省今年要在完成国家计划以外，再增产上百万吨的煤炭。中共辽宁省委最近召开市委书记和矿务局长会议，进一步统一了对增产煤炭的思想认识，解决了当前煤炭生产急需的一万七千套滚珠等物资供应的一些问题。中共河北省委的负责同志也亲自抓煤炭的生产，解决一些重要问题。中共安徽省委书记等负责同志最近已到淮南煤矿指导组织新的生产高潮的工作。中共河南省委已经就煤炭生产的材料设备供应等工作作出了决议，以保证完成和超额完成今年全年的煤炭生产计划。山东省委正在召开煤矿的七级干部会议，听取各级干部的意见，并对如何解决煤矿当前存在的问题作出了决议。
    煤炭工业部负责人说，为了迅速地组织新的生产高潮，各煤矿要迅速把当前的形势、任务和计划，交给群众讨论，制定具体措施。组织新的生产高潮的工作，当前要作好五抓：抓政治思想工作和群众运动，抓设备材料的供应和设备检修，抓工人的生活，抓技术革新和技术革命，抓具体措施和典型经验。煤炭工业部号召各煤矿的领导干部，要发扬和工人同吃同住同劳动的精神和作风，每天应有四分之一到三分之一的干部和工人一起劳动。这样就可以更好地鼓舞工人的生产情绪，具体了解和及时地处理生产中的问题，把煤炭工业战线的增产节约运动，迅速地推向新的高潮。
    国务院副总理薄一波参加了这次电话会议，并且就当前煤炭和钢铁的生产问题讲了话。参加这次会议的有各省、市和自治区的煤炭工业厅、局长和全国重点煤矿的干部，产煤炭钢铁较多的七个省的管理工业的省委书记也参加了这次会议。这七个省是辽宁、黑龙江、吉林、河北、山西、山东和河南。
