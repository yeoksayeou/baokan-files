Developing a diversified economy and rationally arranging the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries is in line with the requirements of the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy. The law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy first requires a proper ratio between the two major categories of social production—the production of means of production and the means of livelihood. Secondly, it requires a proper ratio between industry and agriculture, as well as among the various sectors within industry and agriculture. Only with a correct ratio among agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries can they achieve comprehensive and rapid development. Therefore, all comrades working on the agricultural production front must learn to arrange the various aspects of production within agriculture based on the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy.

The requirement for comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries does not mean developing everything equally without prioritizing. Generally speaking, agriculture should be the main focus, with forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries as secondary. Within agriculture, grain should be the primary focus. Grain is the main material for national economic construction and people's daily life. In the past, we said, "With grain and steel, everything will be easy." This embodies this idea. Therefore, we must strive to expand the sown area of ​​grain crops and strive for a greater harvest of grain. But taking agriculture as the main focus and grain as the primary focus does not mean that we do not need other things, or that we do not need forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Agriculture is the main focus, grain is the primary focus, and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are secondary; afforestation, pig raising, vegetable growing, and fishing are secondary. The reason why people regard agriculture as the "main occupation" and other productions outside agriculture as "sideline occupations" is nothing more than to illustrate that agriculture is the main focus, others are auxiliary, and other productions must obey agriculture and must not hinder the development of agriculture. But we cannot understand "sideline occupations" as dispensable and unimportant. Although there are primary and secondary, large and small categories among them, each item is indispensable in people's lives. For example, the rosin introduced on the second page of this newspaper on July 13 is an indispensable thing in people's lives. Manufacturing one ton of paper requires 10 to 15 kilograms of rosin, 10,000 matches require 1,200 kilograms of rosin, and one ton of soap requires more than 100 kilograms of rosin. In addition, manufacturing paint, insecticides, etc. also requires a lot of rosin. If one less kilogram of rosin is collected, factories that manufacture paper, matches, and soap will lack one kilogram of ingredients. There are often such situations: raw materials such as grease and alkali for manufacturing soap are already available, but soap cannot be manufactured due to the lack of rosin; or raw materials such as antimony sulfide and potassium chlorate for manufacturing matches are already available, but matches cannot be manufactured due to the lack of rosin. From this point of view, since society needs this production, it cannot lack this production. After lacking this production, there will be an imbalance in society. Therefore, people's communes in various places must develop diversified economies according to the specific conditions of each region, and properly arrange large and small projects to promote the development of the entire social economy.

Comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, on the surface, increases investment and spends more labor, but in fact, this is not the case, but only rationally uses existing funds and labor. It is obviously unreasonable to use all funds and labor on agriculture; a portion should be allocated from the existing funds and labor to run forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Running forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries is also for the better development of agriculture. For example, the development of animal husbandry, in addition to supplying people with a large number of meat, eggs, dairy products, fur and other daily necessities, can also provide a large amount of animal power and fertilizer. With a large amount of animal power, the tension of labor can be alleviated; with a large amount of high-quality fertilizer, a lot of labor for accumulating, making, and transporting fertilizer can be saved. This is precisely what agriculture urgently needs. On the other hand, there are many projects in diversified operations that can be operated by rural auxiliary labor. Some people cannot be regarded as a full labor force in agricultural production and agricultural capital construction, but in diversified operations, as long as they find suitable work, they can become production experts; or they can use the gaps in agricultural production to operate early and late.

The seasonality of diversified operations is also very strong. The incubation of freshwater fish fry is mostly in spring; the collection time of tree species is in spring and autumn; if the fungus is not picked in time after it grows, it will melt away; daylilies need to be picked in the morning, and will bloom after noon. The rosin mentioned earlier needs to be collected in midsummer.... Most production projects have their own seasonality. Missing these seasons will either reduce production or result in production failure. The tense season of diversified operations is often the tense season of agricultural production. It is certainly wrong to be busy with diversified operations and lose agriculture; it is equally wrong to be busy with agriculture and lose diversified operations. Therefore, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries must have comprehensive and reasonable arrangements.

In order to ensure the development of diversified operations, a relatively fixed method can be adopted in the use of labor. In addition to ensuring the labor required for agricultural production, the remaining labor can be organized into various professional teams to fix the basic team of diversified operations to ensure that the necessary operating projects will not be squeezed out under any circumstances. Of course, the basic fixed force is not a mechanical division of troops, and the regular work of the professional team must be combined with the mass assault movement. When agricultural affairs are particularly tight, concentrate efforts on agriculture; when agricultural affairs are slightly slack, some forces can also be drawn from agriculture to support diversified operations, and the strength of the professional teams can also be adjusted according to the busy and slack seasons, and they can also support each other flexibly. This can ensure the balanced development of agriculture and diversified operations.

In order to better develop diversified operations, it is also necessary to define the scope of operations. We must distinguish which are collective operations, which are decentralized operations, which are operated by the commune, which are operated by the production team, and which can encourage family operations by commune members. This is an issue related to fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses for diversified operations, and it is also an issue related to tapping labor potential, which must be well resolved. Collective operation can enhance planning, make unified and rational use of resources, and is conducive to greater development of diversified operations. While carrying out collective operation, it must be allowed and encouraged for commune members to use sporadic time to raise small domestic animals and poultry, and carry out small sideline production to increase social wealth and improve personal lives. Of course, even sporadic production will take up a certain amount of time. When arranging labor, cadres should take this into consideration, that is, they should stipulate the attendance time of commune members every year and every month to ensure that collective production is completed on time, and also reserve time for operating sideline occupations for commune members to dispose of freely. Only in this way, the collective production and sporadic sideline occupations will not have a conflict of time, and neither side will be squeezed out. After defining the scope of operation, for the projects operated collectively, the principle of distribution according to work must be implemented, and distribution methods of more pay for more work and bonus for overproduction must be established. For sideline occupations distributed to individual commune members for operation, the policy of income belonging to individuals should be resolutely implemented to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses.

The key to whether any work is done well lies in leadership, and this is especially true for diversified operations. As long as the party committees at all levels can make reasonable arrangements, assign special personnel to be responsible, and give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, diversified operations will surely be able to develop more, faster, better, and more economically.

### 开展多种经营

    开展多种经营
    开展多种经营，合理地安排农业、林业、牧业、副业和渔业的发展，这是符合于国民经济有计划按比例发展法则的要求的。国民经济有计划按比例发展的法则首先要求社会生产的两大部类——生产资料生产和生活资料生产之间有正确的比例。其次要求工业和农业间，以及工业内部和农业内部的各个部门间都有正确的比例。农林牧副渔五业，只有有了正确的比例之后，才能够得到全面的迅速的发展。因此，一切在农业生产战线上工作的同志，都要学会依据国民经济有计划按比例发展的法则，来安排农业内部的各项生产。
    要求农林牧副渔全面发展，并不是不分主次，平均发展。一般说来，应当以农业为主，以林、牧、副、渔为次。在农业中，又要以粮食为主。粮食是国家经济建设和人民日常生活的主要物资，过去，我们说：“一个粮食，一个钢铁，有了这两个东西，就什么都好办了。”正是体现了这种思想。因此，要努力扩大粮食作物播种面积，争取粮食更大的丰收。但是以农业为主，以粮食为主，不是说就不要其他了，就不要林业、牧业、副业和渔业了。农业是主，粮食是主，林、牧、副、渔就是次，造林、养猪、种菜、捕鱼就是次。人们所以把农业当作“正业”，农业以外的其他生产当作“副业”，无非是为了说明农业为主，其他为辅，其他生产必须服从农业，不能妨碍农业的发展。但是不能把“副业”理解成可有可无，无关紧要。它们中间虽然有主要次要、大宗小宗之分，但每一项目都是人们生活中不可缺少的。例如本报7月13日二版所介绍的松香，就是人们生活中不可缺少的东西。制造一吨纸要用十到十五公斤松香，一万件火柴要用一千二百公斤松香，一吨肥皂要用一百公斤以上松香，还有制造油漆、杀虫药剂等也都要很多的松香。少采一斤松香，制造纸张、火柴、肥皂的工厂也就缺少一斤配料。常常有这样的情形，制造肥皂的油脂和石碱等原材料都已经具备，但是就因为没有松香而不能制造肥皂；或者制造火柴的硫化锑、氯酸钾等原料都已经具备，但是就因为没有松香而制造不出火柴来。由此看来，社会既然需要这一项生产，也就不能缺少这一项生产，缺少这一项生产后，社会上就会产生失调现象。因此，各地人民公社必须根据各地区的具体条件，开展多种经营，大宗小宗适当安排，促进整个社会经济向前发展。
    全面发展农、林、牧、副、渔各业，从表面上看增加了投资，多花了劳力，实际上，并不是如此，而只是合理地使用现有的资金和劳力。把资金、劳力完全用在农业上，显然是不合理的；应该从现有的资金、劳力中分出一部分来，办林业、牧业、副业和渔业。而办林业、牧业、副业和渔业，也是为了更好地发展农业。比如：牧业的发展，除了供给人民大批肉食、蛋品、乳品、毛皮等生活用品外，还可以提供大量畜力和肥料。有了大量畜力，就可以缓和劳力的紧张状态；有了大量优质肥料，就可以节省很多积肥造肥和运肥的劳动力。这正是农业所迫切需要的。另一方面多种经营中还有不少项目，可以利用农村辅助劳力来经营，有些人在农业生产和农业基本建设中算不上一个全劳动力，而在多种经营中，只要给他找到适当的活路，就能变成生产能手；或者可以起早带晚地利用农业生产的空隙来进行经营。
    多种经营生产的季节性也很强。淡水鱼苗的孵化绝大部分在春季；树种的采集时间是在春秋两季；木耳成长后如不及时采摘，就会化掉；黄花需要在早晨采摘，过午就要开花。前边所说的松香要在盛夏采集……。绝大部分生产项目都有自己的季节性。错过了这些季节，或者减产，或者生产落空。多种经营生产的紧张季节，又往往是农业生产的紧张季节。忙了多种经营，丢了农业，当然不对；忙了农业，丢了多种经营，同样不对。因此，对农业、林业、牧业、副业和渔业必须有全面合理的安排。
    为了保证多种经营的发展，在劳力使用上可以采取相对固定的办法，除去保证农业生产所需要的劳力外，其余劳力可以组织各种专业队，固定多种经营的基本队伍，保证必须经营的项目在任何情况下都不致被挤掉。当然基本固定力量并不是机械的分兵把口，专业队的经常工作必须和群众性的突击运动相结合。农事特别紧张的时候，集中力量搞农业；农事稍闲的时候，也可以从农业抽出一部分力量支援多种经营，各专业队的力量还可以按季节忙闲进行调整，也可以机动灵活地互相支援。这样就可以保证农业和多种经营平衡发展。
    为了更好地开展多种经营，还必须划定经营范围。要区别一下，哪些集体经营，哪些分散经营，哪些由公社经营，哪些由生产队经营，哪些可以鼓励社员家庭经营。这是一个与充分发挥群众多种经营积极性有关的问题，也是和挖掘劳动潜力有关的问题，必须很好地解决。集体经营可以增强计划性，统一合理利用资源，有利于多种经营的更大发展。在开展集体经营的同时，必须允许和鼓励社员利用零星时间饲养小家畜小家禽，进行家庭小副业生产，以增加社会财富，改善个人生活。当然，即使是零星生产，也要占据一定的时间，干部在安排劳动力时要照顾到这一点，就是既要规定社员每年每月的出勤时间，保证集体生产按时完成，也要留出经营副业的时间，让社员自由支配。只有这样，集体生产和零星副业才不会发生互抢时间的矛盾，才不至于挤掉任何一方。在划定经营范围以后，对于集体经营的项目，必须贯彻执行按劳分配的原则，定出多劳多得、超产奖励的分配办法。对于分散给社员个人经营的副业，应当坚决贯彻执行收益归个人的方针，以充分发挥群众的积极性。
    任何工作做得好坏，关键还在于领导，多种经营更是如此。各级党委只要能够合理安排，专人负责，再加上充分发挥群众的积极性，多种经营就一定能够又多又快又好又省地发展起来。
