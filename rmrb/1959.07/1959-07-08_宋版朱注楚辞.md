A Song Dynasty Edition of Zhu Xi's Commentary on the Chu Ci

The China Bookstore in Beijing recently collected a complete and undamaged Song Dynasty edition of Zhu Xi's commentary on the Chu Ci. Previously, only the Beijing Library possessed a Song Dynasty edition of Zhu Xi's commentary on the Chu Ci. It is a woodblock print from the Duanping era of the Southern Song Dynasty, which has been photolithographically reprinted by the People's Literature Publishing House. The late Mr. Zheng Zhenduo wrote a lengthy postscript for the book, with detailed and thorough textual research.

The Song Dynasty edition of the Chu Ci recently discovered by the China Bookstore has been compared with the aforementioned photolithographic reprint of the Southern Song Dynasty Duanping edition, and several differences were found. First, the photolithographic Duanping edition has nine lines of eighteen characters per half page, while the newly discovered edition has nine lines of seventeen characters. Second, the photolithographic Duanping edition contains a postscript by Zhu Jian (Zhu Xi's grandson) in the afterword, marked with the Duanping era; the newly discovered edition also has his postscript, but without the Duanping era designation. However, both books have one thing in common: they both contain a postscript by Zhu Zai (Zhu Xi's son). From Zhu Zai's postscript, it is known that he compiled his father's posthumous manuscript of "Chu Ci Afterword" and the already published Chu Ci Collected Commentary and had them printed together in the tenth year of the Jiading era. The photolithographic edition added the Duanping era, while the newly discovered edition only has the Jia Ding era's cyclical year. Third, the photolithographic Duanping edition publishes the entire argumentation in two volumes; the newly discovered edition appends the argumentation separately after each commentary, without compiling the argumentation into separate volumes. Fourth, the photolithographic Duanping edition has the words "Zhu Zi Collected Commentary" engraved at the bottom of the first line of the inner pages; the newly discovered edition has "Hui Weng Collected Commentary" engraved instead. Fifth, in Zhu Jian's postscript in the Chu Ci Afterword of the photolithographic Duanping edition, the character "Jian" in Zhu Jian's name is in a signature style; in the newly discovered edition, the character "Jian" is engraved in the same regular script as the rest of the postscript. Comparing the printing dates of the two books, the newly discovered edition should be sixteen years earlier than the Duanping edition. Currently, it is also a unique copy. (Attached picture)

    宋版朱注楚辞
    北京市中国书店最近收集到一部完整无缺的宋版朱熹注的楚辞。宋版的朱注楚辞，原来只有北京图书馆存有一部。它是南宋端平年代的刻本，已由人民文学出版社影印出版，已故郑振铎先生曾为该书写有长跋，考证详明。
    中国书店最近发现的这部宋版楚辞，曾经和上述影印南宋端平刻本作了比对，发现有几处不同。第一，影印端平本是半页九行十八字，新发现本是九行十七字。第二，影印端平本，在后语中，有朱鉴（朱熹之孙）的跋语，缀以端平年代；新发现本也有他的跋，无端平字样，但两书有一共同处，就是全有朱在（朱熹之子）的跋。从朱在的跋语中，知道他是在嘉定十年把他父亲的“楚辞后语”遗稿和已经刊行的楚辞集注并刻成书的。只是影印本增刻了端平年代，而新发现本却仅有嘉定的年代干支。第三，影印端平本的刻法，是把辨证全文，分作两卷刊成；新发现本却是在每段注后，单独地附以辨证，并未把辨证集中分卷。第四，影印端平本，在内页首行下端刻的是朱子集注字样；新发现本却是刻的“晦翁集注”。第五，影印端平本楚辞后语中，朱鉴跋语的“鉴”字，是签押字体；新发现本的“鉴”字，与跋语全文其他字体刻法相同，即全是正楷体。比较两书刊刻年代，新发现本应该比端平本要早十六年。在目前说来，也是一部孤本。（附图片）
