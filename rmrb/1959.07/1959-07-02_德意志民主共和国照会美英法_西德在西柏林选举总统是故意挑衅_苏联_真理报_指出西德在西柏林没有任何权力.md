    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 30th – The government of the German Democratic Republic today, through the Czechoslovakian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, separately delivered a note to the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, protesting West Germany's holding of presidential elections in West Berlin.

    The note said that the holding of West German presidential elections in West Berlin shows not a policy of willingness to reach an understanding on the West Berlin issue and strive for easing tensions in Germany, but a policy of trying to turn West Berlin into a source of constant provocations. This planned step once again demonstrates that the West German government is trying to obstruct the countries participating in the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference from reaching an understanding on the West Berlin issue.

    The note pointed out that the election of the West German president in West Berlin is contrary to the position expressed by Western countries at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference that "the West Berlin area is not part of the Federal Republic of Germany."

    The note reminded the Western governments that the holding of West German presidential elections in West Berlin demonstrates that the West German government will continue to pursue a policy against the German Democratic Republic and other European countries from West Berlin and use the West Berlin issue to do so. The note solemnly declared that the government of the German Democratic Republic lodges the most serious protest against this measure. The planners of this policy must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    The note concluded by saying that the government of the German Democratic Republic believes that it is necessary to seek a solution to the West Berlin issue at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in such a way as to prevent such provocations from happening again in the future.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th – "Pravda" published an article by an "Observer" on the 29th, criticizing the provocative behavior of the Bonn government in announcing that it would hold West German presidential elections in West Berlin.

    The article pointed out that it is well known that West Berlin has never been West German territory, nor is it within the scope of the Bonn government's activities, either in the past or now. West Berlin is located within the territory of the German Democratic Republic, and West Germany has no authority over it.

    The intention of the West German government's irrational actions is very obvious: they want to hinder the normalization of the Berlin situation and continue to make West Berlin a permanent source of domestic and international tension in Germany. By taking this approach, Bonn is attempting to obstruct the continued holding of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference and to prevent the West Berlin issue from being resolved unanimously on a sensible basis that takes into account the reality of the situation. The article said that news about the decision to hold presidential elections in West Berlin has caused unease in West German political circles and public opinion, which can be reflected in West German newspapers.

    The article said that the position taken by the leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party is surprising. When the Federal Parliamentary Committee discussed the location of the West German presidential election, they even insisted that the election must be held in West Berlin. How can the actions of the leading organs of the German Social Democratic Party be compatible with their statements about the need to normalize the German situation? How can they be compatible with their plans for solving the German question, including provisions for developing contacts between the two Germanys and arranging cooperation between the two Germanys? It seems that the leaders of the German Social Democratic Party are only verbally striving to ease domestic and international tensions in Germany, while in reality their actions are consistent with those of the West German ruling group.

    The article concluded by pointing out that the Western governments that instigated political propaganda in West Berlin together with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany must be responsible for the consequences of this activity, which is incompatible with the task of easing tensions in Central Europe.

    德意志民主共和国照会美英法
    西德在西柏林选举总统是故意挑衅
    苏联“真理报”指出西德在西柏林没有任何权力
    新华社柏林30日电　德意志民主共和国政府今天通过捷克斯洛伐克外交部分别转交给美、英、法三国外交代表一项照会，抗议西德在西柏林举行总统选举。
    照会说，在西柏林举行西德总统选举，这种举动所表明的，并不是那种愿意就西柏林问题达成谅解和争取缓和德国紧张局势的政策，而是那种竭力要把西柏林变成不断制造挑衅的策源地的政策。这一个有计划的步骤再次表明：西德政府竭力阻挠参加日内瓦外长会议各国在西柏林问题上达成谅解。
    照会指出，在西柏林选举西德总统，这是同西方国家在日内瓦外长会议上所表示的“西柏林地区不是德意志联邦共和国的一部分”的立场相违背的。
    照会提醒西方国家政府注意，在西柏林举行西德总统选举这件事说明：西德政府将继续从西柏林推行反对德意志民主共和国和其它欧洲国家的政策，并且利用西柏林问题来这样做。照会郑重声明：德意志民主共和国政府对这一措施提出最严重的抗议。这一政策的策划人必须对由此而产生的一切后果负全部责任。
    照会最后说，德意志民主共和国政府认为，有必要在外长会议上寻求使这种挑衅今后不再发生的这样一种解决西柏林问题的办法。
    新华社莫斯科30日电　“真理报”29日发表了一篇“观察家”的文章，抨击波恩政府宣布要在西柏林进行西德总统选举的挑衅行为。
    文章指出，众所周知，无论过去和现在西柏林从来不是西德的领土，也不是波恩政府的活动范围。西柏林位于德意志民主共和国领土之内，西德对于它没有任何权力。
    西德政府这种缺乏理智的行动的企图是很明显的，他们想阻挠柏林局势正常化，继续使西柏林成为德国国内和国际紧张局势的永久策源地。波恩采取这种做法，是企图阻挠日内瓦外长会议继续举行和使西柏林问题不能在考虑到现实局势的明智的基础上得到一致的解决。文章说，关于决定在西柏林进行总统选举的消息引起了西德政界和社会舆论的不安，这可以在西德的报纸上得到反映。
    文章说，但是，西德社会民主党领导人所采取的立场引起了人们的惊奇。在联邦议院委员会讨论西德总统的选举地点时，他们竟然也坚持这个选举一定要在西柏林举行。德国社会民主党领导机关的这种行动怎么能和他们关于必须使德国局势正常化的声明相容呢？怎么能和他们的包括规定要发展两个德国的接触和安排两个德国的合作的解决德国问题的计划相容呢？看来，德国社会民主党的领导人仅仅是在口头上争取缓和德国内部的和国际的紧张局势，而在实际上他们的行动和西德统治集团是一致的。
    文章最后指出，同德意志联邦共和国政府一起唆使在西柏林进行政治宣传的那些西方国家政府，要为这种活动的后果负责，这种活动同缓和中欧紧张局势的任务是不相容的。
