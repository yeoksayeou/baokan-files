One Rice Plant, Half Ounce of Grain
    Clear Goals, High Morale
    Lujiang Launches "Half Ounce Per Plant" Campaign to Strive for High Rice Yields
    (Our dispatch) Comrade Zhan Xianyu, Secretary of the Lujiang County Party Committee, reports: Lujiang County, Anhui Province, is currently carrying out a rice "half ounce per plant" campaign, striving for more panicles, larger panicles, and full grains, to achieve half an ounce of grain per rice plant. In this way, based on an average of 30,000 seedlings planted per mu, each mu can yield 1,875 jin of rice.

    The Basis for Launching the "Half Ounce Per Plant" Campaign

    Striving for half an ounce of grain per rice plant has a sufficient basis. In 1957, over 10,000 mu of rice in the county achieved yields of 800 to over 1,000 jin per mu. At that time, sparse planting was still common, with only over 10,000 rice plants per mu, and the yield per plant had already reached 7.5 qian to 1.3 liang. Last year, the average mu yield of early rice increased by more than double compared to 1957; of which more than 25,000 mu achieved yields of over 2,000 jin per mu. Based on 30,000 plants per mu, each rice plant yielded more than half an ounce.

    This year's "half ounce per plant" campaign has even more favorable conditions. First, the quality of cultivation and planting is much better than in the past. There is a large quantity and good quality of base fertilizer, in addition to a large amount of soil fertilizer, an average of 30 dan of green manure is applied per mu; and fine varieties have been carefully selected, and rational close planting of 3x6 inch and 4x6 inch spacing has been promoted according to local conditions, and the seedlings are growing vigorously. At present, the 420,000 mu of early rice in the county have generally headed; the 320,000 mu of mid-season rice are developing vigorously; and the 240,000 mu of single-season late rice have mostly passed the regreening stage and are growing well. In particular, the people's communes have implemented unified leadership and hierarchical management, with production teams contracting production and implementing overproduction reward policies, which has greatly mobilized the masses' enthusiasm for production. At the same time, after last year's Great Leap Forward, cadres and the masses have gained rich leadership and yield-increasing experience. With these favorable conditions, coupled with fully utilizing human subjective initiative, it is entirely possible to achieve the "half ounce per plant" requirement.

    In order to ensure that the rice "half ounce per plant" campaign is carried out both vigorously and practically, the Lujiang County Party Committee, based on last year's experience, has grasped three main measures: political and ideological education, cultivating large-area high-yield fields and cadre experimental fields, and strengthening technical guidance.

    Political Leadership - Boost Enthusiasm

    Adhere to political leadership. From the county party committee to the production team's party branch, the first secretary personally leads the rice "half ounce per plant" campaign. The county has put forward:
    “The whole party is determined, the whole people seize ‘half ounce per plant’, no grain in hand, no rest from management” a battle slogan. Recently, the county party committee proposed to launch a "300,000 panicles per mu of rice" high-yield movement, which more specifically enriched the content of the "half ounce per plant" campaign. The county and communes have also established political work offices, each with a secretary as director. The 23 communes in the county are divided into eight zones according to their different regional characteristics, carrying out red flag competitions between communes, teams, groups, and individuals.

    Establish Models - Balanced Development

    Cadres at all levels cultivate large-area high-yield fields and cadre experimental fields, establish models, and drive the management of general fields, resolutely eliminate Class III seedlings, and promote balanced growth of all seedlings. Cadres throughout the county, from the county to the production team, have all cultivated one to three mu of experimental fields, cultivating a total of 300,000 mu of large-area high-yield fields of early and mid-season rice. The high-yield areas over a thousand mu are directly led by the county party committee, and the high-yield areas over five hundred mu are led by the commune party committee, setting an example in everything, summarizing experience in a timely manner, and guiding the overall situation. The county party committee also proposed the leadership method of "erecting banners, seeking balance; grasping both ends, leading the middle," and comprehensively promoted the "four packages, three managements." The "four packages" are: leading cadres, party members, and league members package positions (high-yield areas and management scope), package time (from management to harvesting), package tasks (achieving "half ounce per plant"), and package mobilizing the masses. The "three managements" are: Class I seedlings are managed by commune members, Class II seedlings are managed by party members, league members, and cadres, and Class III seedlings are managed by party committee secretaries at all levels.

    Technical Measures - Link Closely

    Adopt various measures according to the time and local conditions to strengthen technical guidance. In field management, various places have generally proposed quality standards for various farm works to deepen the rice "half ounce per plant" campaign step by step. For example: in weeding and soil loosening, the first weeding begins after the seedlings have taken root, and then two or three more weedings are done every ten days, combined with checking and replanting seedlings, removing barnyard grass and topdressing, to achieve weed-free fields, rotten mud, and level fields. Generally, three topdressings are required: the first is applied before tillering, mainly with nitrogen fertilizer; the second is applied in combination with the second weeding, with a mixture of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers; and the third is applied during the heading stage, mainly with phosphorus fertilizer. In terms of baking the fields, they should be lightly and frequently baked to promote the downward extension of rice roots, making the roots firm and preventing lodging. When baking the fields, attention should also be paid to saving water, baking the low-lying fields first, and then the high-lying fields. In terms of irrigation, the principle of shallow watering - deep watering - shallow watering is mastered. In addition, it is also necessary to do a good job in drought prevention, flood prevention, flood control, wind prevention, pest and disease prevention, and lodging prevention. Various places have established specialized leadership organizations and intelligence organizations to prevent problems early and strive for initiative.

    At present, a rice "half ounce per plant" campaign centered on field management is being enthusiastically carried out in Lujiang County. The labor force participating in field management in various places accounts for 50% to 70% of the total labor force (including the management of other crops). Recently, the county has also formed a ten-thousand-person inspection, evaluation, and promotion team for the rice "half ounce per plant" campaign. Each commune has also formed an inspection team composed of leading cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians, adopting the method of field diagnosis, analyzing the reasons, and supplementing whatever is lacking, checking and appraising each plot, strengthening the management of Class I and Class II seedlings while focusing on eliminating Class III seedlings. The 23 communes throughout the county have universally launched a face-to-face competition centered on the "half ounce per plant" campaign, creating a new situation in which every commune strives to be at the forefront, every team strives to be at the forefront, every group strives to be at the forefront, and everyone strives to be at the forefront.

    一棵稻　一两粮
    目标明确　斗志昂扬
    庐江开展“棵两”运动争水稻高产
    本报讯　中共庐江县委书记湛先余报道：安徽省庐江县现在正开展一个水稻“棵两”运动，力争水稻穗多、穗大、粒饱，达到每棵稻长一两谷。这样，按每亩平均栽秧三万棵计算，每亩就可收一千八百七十五斤稻谷。
  开展“棵两”运动的根据
    争取一棵稻收一两粮，是有充分依据的。1957年，全县就有一万多亩水稻亩产达到八百斤到一千多斤，当时一般还是稀植，一亩田只有一万多棵稻，每棵稻的产量已达七钱五到一两三。去年早稻的平均亩产量，比1957年增加一倍以上；其中有二万五千多亩亩产量达到二千斤以上，以每亩三万棵计算，每棵稻子就合一两多。
    今年开展水稻“棵两”运动有着更多的有利条件。首先，耕作和栽培质量比过去好得多。基肥量多质好，除施大量土肥以外，平均每亩还施绿肥三十担；并且精选了良种，因地制宜推行了三、六寸见方和四、六寸见方的合理密植，禾苗生长旺盛。目前，全县四十二万亩早稻已普遍抽穗；三十二万亩中稻发育茁壮；二十四万亩单季晚稻，绝大部分也闯过了返青关，生长良好。特别是人民公社实行了统一领导和分级管理，生产队包产落实，贯彻了超产奖励政策，大大调动了群众的生产积极性。同时，经过去年的大跃进，干部和群众都有了丰富的领导经验和增产经验。有了这些有利条件，再加上充分发挥人的主观能动作用，实现水稻“棵两”的要求，是完全有可能的。
    为了使水稻“棵两”运动既轰轰烈烈、又扎扎实实地开展，庐江县委根据去年的经验，抓住了政治思想教育、培养大面积丰产田和干部种试验田以及加强技术指导三项主要措施。
  政治挂帅　鼓足干劲
    坚持政治挂帅，从县委到生产队的党支部，都由第一书记亲自领导水稻“棵两”运动。全县提出了：
  “全党下决心，全民夺‘棵两’，粮食不到手，管理不罢休”的战斗口号。最近，县委又提出开展“水稻每亩三十万穗”的丰产运动，更具体地充实了“棵两”运动的内容。县、公社还建立了政治工作办公室，各有一个书记为主任。全县二十三个公社，按照地区的不同特点，划成了八个片，开展社与社、队与队、组与组、人与人之间的红旗竞赛。
  树立标兵　平衡发展
    各级干部大种试验田和培养大面积丰产田，树立标兵，带动一般田的管理，坚决消灭三类苗，促使块块禾苗均衡生长。全县从县到生产队的干部，人人都种了一亩到三亩试验田，共计培养了早、中稻大面积丰产田三十万亩。凡千亩以上的丰产片由县委直接负责领导，五百亩以上的丰产片由公社党委负责领导，事事做出样子，及时总结经验，指导全面。县委还提出了“树旗帜，求平衡；抓两头，带中间”的领导方法，全面推行了四包、三管。“四包”就是：领导干部、党、团员包阵地（丰产片和管理范围）、包时间（从管到收割）、包任务（实现“棵两”）、包发动群众。“三管”就是：一类苗由社员管，二类苗由党、团员和干部管，三类苗由各级党委书记管。
  技术措施　环环扣紧
    因时、因地制宜的采取各种措施，加强技术指导。各地在田间管理中，普遍提出了各项农活的质量标准，使水稻“棵两”运动步步深入。例如：在中耕耘草方面，禾苗活棵后开始耘第一交草，以后每隔十天再耘二交、三交，并结合查苗补苗、拔除稗草和追肥，达到田无杂草，泥烂田平。一般要求追肥三次：第一次在发棵前追施，以氮肥为主；结合耘第二交草追第二次肥，以氮、磷、钾肥混施；孕穗时再追一次穗肥，以磷肥为主。在烤田方面，要轻烤、勤烤，促进稻根向下伸长，使根部扎实，防止倒伏。烤田时结合做好节约用水，先烤低处田，后烤高处田。在灌溉方面，掌握了浅浇——深浇——浅浇的合理灌溉原则。另外，还要做好防旱、防涝、防洪、防风、防病虫害、防倒伏等工作，各地分别建立了专门领导机构和情报组织，及早预防，力争主动。
    目前，一个以田间管理为中心的水稻“棵两”运动，已在庐江县热烈地开展起来了。各地参加田间管理的劳动力已占总劳动力50％到70％（包括其他作物的管理）。最近，全县又组成了水稻“棵两”运动万人检查评比促进团，各公社也组成了由领导干部、老农、技术员等参加的检查组，采取田头会诊、分析原因，缺什么补什么的办法，逐丘检查逐丘鉴定，一面加强对一、二类苗的管理，一面突击消灭三类苗。全县二十三个公社，普遍掀起了以“棵两”运动为中心的面对面的竞赛热潮，造成了一个社社争上游、队队争上游、组组争上游、人人争上游的新局面。
