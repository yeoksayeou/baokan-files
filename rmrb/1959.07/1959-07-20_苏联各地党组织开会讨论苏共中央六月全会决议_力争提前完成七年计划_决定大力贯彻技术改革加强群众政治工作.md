    Moscow dispatch, July 19th. Party central committees and party activist conferences have recently been held in various Soviet republics and regions to discuss and formulate measures to mobilize the implementation of the resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee's June Plenum. These meetings unanimously supported the resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee's Plenum and formulated specific plans for further realizing comprehensive mechanization and automation, striving to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    The meetings convened by party organizations at all levels, in the spirit of the CPSU Central Committee's Plenum, summarized achievements and experiences, strictly criticized and corrected shortcomings, and seriously discussed how to vigorously implement technological reforms in the production and construction of industrial enterprises in various regions in the future. The specific issues involved in the discussion were very extensive. Party meetings held in Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Moldova, and Moscow, among other republics, first affirmed the achievements made in technological innovation in recent years. For example, Ukraine has manufactured more than 250 new types of machines and equipment in the past year and a half. Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Belarus, and other regions have also produced hundreds of new machines, many of which have reached world-class levels in technology. It is precisely because of the great achievements made in technological innovation that industrial enterprises in various regions have been able to further improve labor productivity and excellently complete production tasks.

    In addition, party meetings in various regions focused on discussing specific methods for carrying out large-scale technological innovations in industrial construction in the future. The discussion unanimously pointed out that, based on the potential possibilities in various regions, every factory and construction site must fully improve technology to gradually transition the production process to comprehensive mechanization and automation. At the same time, it is necessary to first vigorously produce high-efficiency automated machines and a large number of automated production lines. Enterprises in Moscow plan to produce 700 new types of machines this year and build 450 automated production lines in seven years. Trutnev, a worker at the "Bolshevik" factory in Leningrad, said at the party activist conference: Now every worker in our factory has a personal plan for technological reform and invention. We are determined to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule based on improving technology.

    The Central Committee Plenum of the Ukrainian Party unanimously agreed during the discussion that technological reform must first be vigorously implemented in the heavy industry sector. Ukraine occupies an important position in the Soviet Union's steel, coal, and machine industry production. The Plenum determined that comprehensive technological reforms should be carried out in these sectors first. In addition to manufacturing a large number of new automated machines, this republic also pays great attention to renovating and expanding existing enterprises during the Seven-Year Plan to modernize their production processes. In the Lugansk mining area of Donbas alone, 92 mines will undergo comprehensive renovation. According to calculations, these mine renovations only require a small amount of investment, and the output can be increased by 30% after the renovation, and the cost per ton of coal can also be reduced by 30%. This is equivalent to saving the country 2 billion rubles each year. The Central Committee Plenums of the Belarusian, Moldavian, and Uzbek parties also focused on discussing the importance of renovating existing enterprises and replacing old machines, unanimously agreeing that adopting this method can not only reduce investment but also save time, increase labor productivity, and rapidly increase production. For example, renovating only 41 wineries in Moldova can increase grape processing by 6,250 tons per day and night.

    Scientific and technological work was also discussed at party meetings at all levels. The meeting believed that in order to ensure the vigorous realization of comprehensive mechanization and automation of the production process, it is necessary to further improve the work of scientific research institutions and bring them closer to production. Each economic zone and some large industrial enterprises must have their own research institutes related to technological reforms. At the same time, it is necessary to consolidate the existing invention and innovation organizations of industrial enterprises and vigorously lead and organize new workshop and section integrated technological innovation research groups. During the discussions at the party meetings in various regions, conservatism that hinders technological reform and the phenomenon of scientific research being divorced from production were criticized.

    After the June Plenum, a production competition centered on technological innovation was launched throughout the Soviet Union. This competition reflected the workers' strong demand for reforming technology, so it was able to develop rapidly. At present, party organizations in various regions have successively convened meetings and formulated specific plans, which have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the working masses. The representatives attending party meetings in various regions unanimously stated that they would strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule on the basis of vigorously promoting technological reforms.

    Many regions in Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Belarus, and Russia have decided to complete the Seven-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. The director of the "Zaporozhye" steel plant said at the Ukrainian Party Central Committee Plenum: Our factory strives to complete the Seven-Year Plan in five years, and the output of steel will reach the planned output of 1965 in 1962, that is, complete the Seven-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. In order to strive to generally improve the level of production, many advanced workers at the party meeting volunteered to go to some backward production groups to help improve work and increase output.

    The party meetings unanimously pointed out in the discussions that in order to ensure the further upsurge of the masses' political and labor enthusiasm, and in order to effectively implement the resolutions of the June Plenum and vigorously promote production technology reform, party organizations at all levels must strengthen the leadership of mass political work. Hundreds of party workers have now gone deep into workshops and construction sites. Party organizations at the grassroots level have begun to more specifically supervise and inspect technological reform work, so that the resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee's June Plenum can be earnestly and effectively implemented.

    苏联各地党组织开会讨论苏共中央六月全会决议
    力争提前完成七年计划
    决定大力贯彻技术改革加强群众政治工作
    本报莫斯科19日电　苏联各加盟共和国和各州最近先后召开了党的中央全会和党的积极分子会议，讨论和制订关于动员贯彻苏共中央六月全会的措施。这些会议一致拥护苏共中央全会决议，并就进一步实现全面机械化和自动化的问题作了具体规划，力争提前完成七年计划。
    这次各级党组织召开的会议都本着苏共中央全会精神，总结成绩经验，严格批评和纠正缺点，认真讨论了今后在各地工业企业生产建设中如何大力贯彻技术改革的问题。讨论中所涉及的具体问题非常广泛。乌克兰、白俄罗斯、乌兹别克、摩尔达维亚等共和国和莫斯科举行的党的会议，在讨论中首先肯定了近年来在技术革新方面所取得的成就。例如乌克兰在最近一年半内制造出了二百五十多种新式机器与装备。列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、白俄罗斯等地也生产出了数百种新的机器，其中有许多机器在技术上都达到了世界上头等的水准。正由于在技术革新方面所取得的很大成就，才使各地工业企业得以进一步提高劳动生产率，出色地完成了生产任务。
    此外各地党的会议上都集中讨论了今后在工业建设中大规模进行技术革新的具体办法。讨论一致指出，根据各地潜在可能，必须要使每一个工厂、每一个建设工地都全力改进技术，使生产过程逐步过度到全面机械化和自动化。同时必须首先大力生产高效率的自动化机器和大批自动化作业线。莫斯科市各企业今年计划要生产七百种新式的机器，七年中要修建四百五十条自动化作业线。列宁格勒“布尔什维克”工厂工人特鲁特涅夫在党的积极分子会议上说：现在我们厂的每个工人都订有个人的技术改革和发明创造计划。我们决心在改进技术的基础上争取提前完成七年计划。
    乌克兰党的中央全会讨论中一致认为必须首先在重工业部门大力贯彻技术改革。乌克兰在全苏钢铁、煤炭、机器工业生产中占有重要地位。全会确定在这些部门中首先全面进行技术改革。这个共和国在七年计划中除了要大量制造新的自动化机器外，还非常注意改建和扩建现有企业，使其生产过程现代化。仅顿巴斯的鲁干斯克一个矿区就有九十二个矿井要全面进行改建。据计算，这些矿井改建中只需投少量资金，改建后产量就可提高30％，每吨煤的成本也可以减低30％。这就相当于每年为国家节约二十亿卢布。白俄罗斯、摩尔达维亚和乌兹别克党的中央全会上也集中讨论了改建现有企业，更换旧机器的重要性，一致认为，采取这个方法不仅可以减少投资，而且可以节省时间，提高劳动生产率，迅速增加产品。如摩尔达维亚仅改建四十一个酿酒厂，就可使一昼夜的葡萄加工增加六千二百五十吨。
    党的各级会议上还讨论了科学技术工作。会议认为，为了保证大力实现生产过程全面机械化和自动化，必须要进一步改善科学研究机关的工作，使其更接近生产。各个经济区和一些大型的工业企业必须设有自己的有关技术改革的研究所。同时，必须要巩固工业企业现有的创造发明组织，大力领导组织新的车间、工段综合技术革新研究小组。各地党的会议讨论中对个别阻碍技术改革的保守主义和科学研究脱离生产的现象进行了批评。
    六月全会后，全苏各地掀起了以技术革新为中心内容的生产竞赛。这个竞赛反映了工人们对改革技术的强烈要求，因此得以迅速开展。目前各地党组织相继召开会议，制订具体计划，大大鼓舞了劳动群众的热情。出席各地党的会议的代表们一致表示要在大搞技术改革的基础上力争提前完成七年计划。
    乌克兰、乌兹别克、白俄罗斯和俄罗斯等共和国的许多州都决定要提前一年完成七年计划。“萨坡罗什”钢铁厂厂长在乌克兰党中央全会上说：我们工厂争取用五年时间完成七年计划，而钢铁的产量要在1962年就达到1965年的计划产量，即提前三年完成七年计划。为了争取普遍提高生产水平，党的会议上有许多先进工人纷纷自动到一些落后的生产小组去帮助改进工作提高产量。
    党的会议在讨论中还一致指出，为保证群众政治劳动热情的进一步高涨，为了有效地贯彻实现六月全会决议和大搞生产技术改革，各级党的组织必须加强对群众政治工作的领导。现在已有成百上千的党的工作者深入到车间和工地去。各级基层党组织开始更具体地督促和检查技术改革工作，使苏共中央六月全会的决议得到认真有效的贯彻执行。
