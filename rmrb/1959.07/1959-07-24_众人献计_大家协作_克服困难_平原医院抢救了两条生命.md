Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd: The Pingyuan County People's Hospital in Shandong Province overcame the difficulties of poor equipment conditions and rescued two lives.

On the evening of June 29, the Pingyuan County People's Hospital in Shandong Province admitted a parturient with vaginal adhesions. Five intern students from Shandong Medical College, led by Doctor Li Shounan, examined the patient's condition and inquired about her medical history. It turned out that after becoming pregnant, the parturient had improperly used vaginal suppositories, causing the vagina to close. Moreover, she had not had a single prenatal examination since becoming pregnant. When labor started, the uterus contracted for a whole day without the child being born, so she came to the hospital to seek emergency medical treatment.

The conditions at Pingyuan Hospital were relatively poor, with incomplete medical equipment and no blood bank facilities. What to do? If the parturient were transferred to Jinan, there wouldn't be enough time, and the fetus's heartbeat was becoming increasingly weak. The five intern students all looked at Doctor Li Shounan with concern, but he had just graduated from school and had been working for less than a year. He had only seen this type of surgery once in school. However, with the issue of life and death in front of them, medical workers had to bravely shoulder the responsibility.

Blood transfusions are very important for cesarean sections and hysterectomies, and no one could estimate how much blood the patient would lose during these surgeries. It was necessary to prepare for a blood transfusion immediately, but what was the parturient's blood type? This was a difficult problem. They remembered the method of using serum extracted from the blood of people with known blood types to determine the blood type of the person being transfused. Fortunately, student Ren Lixing remembered that he had type B blood, and another student with type A blood was found. They extracted serum from their blood to test the patient's blood type. At this time, the five intern students were all concentrated in the laboratory, preparing to give the parturient a blood transfusion.

The operation went smoothly, and a chubby baby was born. But the baby wouldn't cry, and its body had turned purple. The midwife tried patting and rubbing with alcohol, but it was ineffective. They then thought of acupuncture, inserting a needle into the baby's philtrum. The little life cried out "Wah!" Everyone felt unspeakable joy at seeing the child saved.

Based on the specific circumstances of the parturient, a hysterectomy was also necessary, requiring general anesthesia. Who would perform it? In the operating room, besides the four doctors and nurses at the operating table, there were only a few intern students left. At this moment of deciding the patient's life, everyone finally pitched in. Student Yin Jifeng used his past car repair skills to quickly repair a pedal-powered aspirator that was urgently needed; student Zhou Kai held up the patient's mandible with both hands, because the anesthesia equipment was incomplete, so someone had to help administer ether; Zhou Changwen focused intently on observing the changes in the blood pressure monitor. They cooperated in this way, and jointly completed the anesthesia surgery. The operation lasted for five hours under these conditions, and the lives of both the adult and child were finally saved.

    众人献计　大家协作　克服困难
    平原医院抢救了两条生命
    据新华社济南23日电　山东省平原县人民医院，克服了设备条件较差的困难，抢救了两条生命。
    6月29日的晚上，山东省平原县人民医院病房里收了一个阴道粘连的产妇。山东医学院住在这个医院的五个实习学生，在大夫李寿南带领下，一边检查病情，一边询问病史。原来这个产妇在受孕后，由于不适当地应用坐药腐蚀了阴道，以致阴道闭合。而且从受孕以后没有作过一次产前检查。临产时，子宫阵缩了一天没有生下孩子，这才到医院里来找医生急救。
    平原医院条件是比较差的，医疗器材不全，没有血库设备。怎么办呢？如果把产妇转院送到济南去，时间已来不及，胎儿的胎心已经越来越微弱了。五个实习的学生都关切地注视着李寿南大夫，可是他也是刚从学校毕业，工作还不满一年，对这种手术，只是在学校见习过一次。但是，人的生死存亡问题摆在自己面前，做医务工作的人不能不勇敢地担起这个担子。
    输血对剖腹产和子宫截除手术是非常重要的事，谁也估计不到这些手术会使病人失去多少血。必须马上准备输血，可是产妇是什么血型呢？这是一个难题。他们想起用已经知道血型人的血提出血清，可以测定被输血者血型的办法。刚好任立兴同学记得他自己是B型血，另外又找到一个A型血的同学，分别提出血清去给病人查血型。这时，五个实习学生都集中在化验室，准备给产妇输血。
    手术进行得很顺利，一个胖娃娃降生了。但是婴儿不会哭，身上已发紫。助产士用手拍，用酒精擦都不见效。他们又想起针灸的办法，一针刺入婴儿的人中穴，小生命哇的一声哭起来了，眼看着小孩得救，个个都有着说不出的喜悦。
    根据产妇的具体情况，还需要进行子宫截除手术，施行全身麻醉。找谁来作呢？手术室里除了手术台上四个大夫、护士外，剩下来的就是几个实习学生了。在这决定病人生命的时刻，最后大家都动手。尹极峰同学运用他过去修汽车的技术，很快的修理了一个迫切待用的人工脚踏吸引器；周恺同学双手捧起病人的下颔骨，因为麻醉器械不全，只好由人帮忙上乙醚；周长雯聚精会神地观察着血压表的变化。他们就这样互相协作，共同完成了麻醉手术。手术在这种条件下持续了五个小时才结束，大人小孩两条生命终于都得救了。
