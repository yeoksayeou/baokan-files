Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 22nd -- TASS Athens, July 22nd: The Athens Military Tribunal today rendered its verdict: Glezos is deprived of his freedom for nine years: five years of imprisonment and four years of exile in a concentration camp; deprived of political rights for eight years. These sentences are even heavier than those requested by the prosecutor.
        Although the fabricated charge of "espionage" failed, Vouchas and Trikalinos were still sentenced to life imprisonment, Singelakis was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, five years of exile, and deprived of political rights for seven years, Kakagiannis was sentenced to eleven years of imprisonment, five years of exile, and deprived of political rights for seven years; Lagouzarigis was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, four years of exile, and deprived of political rights for five years. The verdict of the military court is final.
        Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 22nd -- TASS Athens, July 22nd: Glezos and other Greek patriots spoke today at the Athens Military Tribunal. Glezos said: "Since there is no evidence for the charges against me, I believe it is a frame-up, and therefore I cannot help but respond. My life's history, my attitude towards my motherland, is enough to answer this question. I don't need to defend myself in this regard. I believe that for the honorable judges, the will of the people is more important than everything else, and the law is above everything. I have not done the things that others have accused me of. I have never met Kollyannis. The charges against me are only for political purposes.” Vouchas said: “I object to the accusation of espionage, which has nothing to do with me, a member of the Greek Communist Party, nor is it possible to have anything to do with it. I object to this unfounded accusation. I object to hostile propaganda and anti-communist propaganda.”
        At this point, the court president rudely ordered Vouchas to stop speaking. Vouchas said, "I am speaking about the substance of the issue," and the court president said, "You are giving political instructions here." Vouchas demanded to be allowed to finish what he wanted to say. The court president frantically roared, "Sit down, or I will have you taken outside," and he immediately said to the police, "Take him out immediately."
        Vouchas had to stop his speech. Trikalinos said that the Royal Prosecutor General had not presented anything to prove that the request to sentence him to death was correct. "I have fought for peace in foreign countries and in Greece in the past and I am still fighting for it now." He answered the court president's words saying, "I refuse to acknowledge the charges against me, and I tell you, honorable judges, that I will continue to fight for the motherland and the people in the future." Singelakis said that he protested being judged as a spy because of his beliefs, which is a disgrace to Greece.
        Kakagiannis refused to accept the accusation that he had engaged in espionage.
        The court adjourned to deliberate and render a verdict.

    希腊反动派丧心病狂迫害爱国者
    雅典军事法庭竟判处格列索斯等人重刑
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社雅典22日讯：雅典军事法庭今天作出判决：剥夺格列索斯自由九年：其中五年徒刑，集中营流放四年；剥夺政治权利八年。这些刑量甚至比检察长要求的还重。
    虽然关于“间谍活动”的诬告遭到了失败，但是，武恰斯和特里卡利诺斯仍然被判处无期徒刑，辛格拉基斯被判处十五年徒刑，五年流放，剥夺政治权利七年，卡卡亚尼斯被判处十一年徒刑，流放五年，剥夺政治权利七年；拉古扎里吉斯被判处五年徒刑，流放四年，剥夺政治权利五年。军事法庭的判决是最后的判决。
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社雅典22日讯：格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者今天在雅典军事法庭上发言。格列索斯说：“由于对我的控告没有任何证据，我认为这是一种诬告，因此，我不能不做回答。我一生的历史，我对祖国的态度足以回答这个问题。我无需在这方面为自己辩护。我相信，对法官先生们来说，人民的意志比一切都重要，法律高于一切。我没有做过别人控告我的那种事情。我从来没有会见过科里雅尼斯。对我提出控告只是为了政治目的。武恰斯说：“我反对控告我进行间谍活动，这种活动跟我，希腊共产党的一个党员没有丝毫关系，也不可能有什么关系。我反对这种毫无根据的控告。我反对敌视宣传和反共宣传。”
    这时，法庭庭长粗暴地命令武恰斯停止发言。武恰斯说，“我在就问题的实质发言”，庭长说，“你在这里是在做政治指示”。武恰斯要求让他把想讲的话讲完。庭长疯狂地咆哮说，“坐下来，不然就把你带到外边去”，他当时就对警察说，马上把他带出去”。
    武恰斯不得不停止自己的发言。特里卡利诺斯说，皇家总检察长没有提出任何东西来证明要把我判处死刑的要求是正确的。我过去和现在一直在国外和希腊本国为和平而斗争。我希望这次审讯是根据无疑违反宪法的三百七十五号法进行的最后一次审讯，他回答法庭庭长的话说，“我拒绝对我的控告，并且告诉你们，法官先生们，我今后仍要为祖国和人民而斗争”。辛格拉基斯说，他抗议由于信仰而把他判为间谍，这是对希腊的耻辱。
    卡卡亚尼斯拒绝硬说他进行间谍活动，这种控告。
    法庭退庭举行会议，以便做出判决。
