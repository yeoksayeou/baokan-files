This newspaper reports that Guangxi Vigorously Raises Pigs and Grows Vegetables.
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, July 25th: Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's vast rural areas, as well as government offices, factories, and schools, are universally developing pig raising, vegetable growing, and poultry breeding. By late June, the region's pig population had increased to 4,080,000 head, and chickens, ducks, and geese had increased to 19,680,000.

    After implementing the policy of giving equal importance to public and private raising, the people's communes further improved the management of collectively raised pigs. Many areas restored and implemented the "three guarantees" (包产、包工、包质) of output, labor, and quality, and the "five determinations" (定人员、定头数、定质量、定肥料、定奖励) of assigning personnel, setting numbers, determining quality, allocating fertilizer, and awarding bonuses, thereby strengthening the pig raising work of the communes and production brigades. On the other hand, the communes and brigades also universally distributed some collectively raised pigs and poultry to commune members for feeding, greatly stimulating the commune members' enthusiasm for developing sideline food production. In Guanyang, Quanzhou, Damiaoshan, Xing'an and other counties (autonomous counties) where pig raising developed rapidly, 40% to 55% or more of the commune members raised pigs. Throughout the autonomous region, the number of poultry raised by commune members generally accounted for 60% to 80% of the total number of poultry. In the process of developing pig and poultry raising by commune members, the communes vigorously helped commune members solve problems such as sources of breeds, feed, and time for managing household sideline occupations. Baise Prefecture has established piglet breeding farms in various places, and some counties and communes have established poultry artificial insemination stations and artificial incubation farms to inseminate commune members' sows and help commune members hatch chickens and ducks. By the end of May, Nanning Prefecture had made most of the sows pregnant within two months, breeding 180,000 piglets. To solve the problem of pig feed, many counties and communes have allocated feed plots to commune members and organized commune members to grow green feed around houses and fields. In order to solve the contradiction between commune members' private sideline work and collective labor, many areas have implemented a basic work-day system, which ensures that commune members work enough days each month and have time to engage in sideline production.

    Cities are also vigorously developing sideline food production. Government offices, troops, factories, and schools are taking various measures to produce sideline foods. Now, government units above the county level are actively growing vegetables and raising pigs. Government cadres are using their spare time or combining it with cadre labor training to carry out production activities, which has gradually become a system. Guilin City has established more than 50 pig farms, etc. By the end of June, a total of 8,140 pigs were raised (excluding troops), and more than 130,000 poultry were raised. The vegetable production and other sideline food production in the urban suburbs have also greatly developed. The suburbs of Liuzhou City have expanded the original five vegetable production teams and formed two vegetable professional communes and five vegetable professional teams, increasing the planting area to 10,000 mu. In addition, they are actively developing pig raising in state-owned farms and selecting some communes or brigades with pig raising experience along traffic lines to establish pig raising bases and develop livestock farms.

    After the vigorous development of sideline food production in urban and rural areas, the market supply is more active than before. In some areas, chickens and ducks have been listed in batches, and rural sideline foods such as pigs, chickens, ducks, and vegetables are continuously supporting the cities. Some government offices, troops, factories, and schools in the city have achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 25th: The livestock and poultry breeding industry in Minfeng Brigade, Yongsheng People's Commune, Hangjin Houqi, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is booming. By the end of June this year, pigs had increased by 1.36 times compared with the same period last year, chickens had increased by 1.39 times, rabbits had increased by more than five times, and sheep had increased by 18%. At present, each commune member's household has an average of 3.9 pigs, 19.3 rabbits, 11.1 chickens, and 5.7 sheep.

    Minfeng Brigade of Yongsheng Commune is located on the Hetao Plain on the southern foot of the Yinshan Mountains. The land here is fertile, and the canals are crisscrossed. In addition to food crops, wild vegetables and pasture are abundant, making it a rich semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area. Since the beginning of this spring, under the leadership of the commune party committee, the 600 households in the brigade have implemented the policy of giving equal importance to public and private raising, and the commune members' enthusiasm for raising livestock and poultry has been unprecedentedly high. They have adopted methods such as self-breeding and self-raising, graded feeding, proper arrangement of labor, broadening the source of feed, vigorously preventing and controlling diseases, and mutual cooperation, so that the livestock and poultry breeding industry has been rapidly developed. Now the brigade has three pig farms and two rabbit farms; the team has nineteen pig farms and one chicken farm. Except for a very small number of single men, every household has flocks of chickens and rabbits and fat pigs.

    Minfeng Brigade attaches great importance to poultry and livestock management in the development of livestock and poultry production. Commune members have implemented separate feeding management and regular cleaning, padding, and disinfection of pens according to the size, sex, strength, and variety of pigs to keep the pens clean, troughs clean, food clean, and pigs clean. The publicly or privately raised chickens and rabbits also have safe chicken coops and rabbit nests to avoid harm from other animals. In terms of forage feed, in addition to collecting various wild grasses and vegetables, agricultural by-products were also used, and pig feed was planted on forest land and wasteland. In order to prevent the occurrence of epidemics, three preventive injections of swine fever and swine erysipelas have been carried out since the beginning of spring, and a comprehensive disinfection and inspection of pigsties and utensils is carried out every five to seven days. At present, this has become an epidemic-free zone for livestock and poultry.

    Minfeng Brigade also attaches great importance to expanding the source of livestock and poultry breeds. In terms of breeding and delivery work, the team's implementation of numbering pens and breeding cards enables the improvement and delivery work of pigs to be carried out in a planned way, avoiding the losses of miscarriage, premature delivery, and crushing in the past. In addition, the team also adopted methods such as heavy breeding and double breeding to produce more piglets and stronger births, and rapidly promoted improved varieties.

    In order to further develop the production of livestock and poultry, the brigade has established a pig, chicken, and rabbit production committee, led by the brigade leader and autonomous region labor model Wang Junyi. Each team has also established a pig, chicken, and rabbit production group to lead and drive commune members to set off a upsurge of everyone doing it and every household raising them.

    广西大力养猪种菜
    内蒙古杭锦后旗永胜公社民丰大队家畜家禽兴旺
    本报南宁25日电　广西僮族自治区的广大农村以及机关、工厂、学校，普遍发展养猪、种菜，繁殖家禽。到6月下旬，全区生猪已增加到四百零八万头，鸡鸭鹅增加到一千九百六十八万只。
    各人民公社在贯彻公养私养并重的方针以后，进一步改善了集体养猪的管理工作，很多地区恢复和贯彻了包产、包工、包质的三包和定人员、定头数、定质量、定肥料、定奖励的五定制度，使公社、生产大队的生猪饲养工作得到加强。另一方面，各公社大队也普遍将部分集体饲养的生猪家禽分给社员喂养，大大激发了社员发展副食品生产的积极性。社员养猪发展快的灌阳、全县、大苗山、兴安等县（自治县）已有40％到55％以上的社员养了猪，全自治区由社员饲养的家禽一般占家禽总数的60％到80％。在发展社员养猪养家禽的过程中，各公社大力帮助社员解决种源、饲料和经营家庭副业的时间等问题。百色专区各地都建立了小猪繁殖场，部分的县和公社建立了家禽人工授精站、人工孵化场，为社员的母猪配种，帮助社员孵化鸡、鸭。南宁专区到5月底止，两个月内作到了大部分母猪满怀，繁殖猪花十八万头。为了解决养猪饲料问题，许多县社已给社员拨了饲料地，并组织社员利用屋前屋后、田头地边种青饲料。为解决社员私人副业用工和集体出工的矛盾，许多地区推行了基本劳动日制，这样既可保证社员每月出足工日，又有时间自己搞点副业生产。
    各个城市也大力发展副食品生产，机关、部队、工厂、学校都采取各项措施生产副食品。现在县以上的机关单位都在积极种菜、养猪，机关干部利用业余时间或结合干部劳动锻炼进行生产活动，并已逐渐形成制度。桂林市已办起养猪场等五十多个，到6月底共养生猪八千一百四十头（不包括部队），饲养的家禽有十三万多只，城市郊区的蔬菜生产和其他副食品生产也有很大发展。柳州市郊已把原来的五个蔬菜生产队扩大，组成两个蔬菜专业公社和五个蔬菜专业队，播种面积增加到一万亩。此外，还积极发展国营农场的养猪事业，并在交通沿线选择一些有养猪经验的公社或大队，建立养猪基地，发展畜牧场。
    经过城乡大力发展副食品生产以后，市场供应较前活跃，有些地区鸡、鸭已成批上市，农村的猪、鸡、鸭、蔬菜等副食品也源源支援城市。城市有些机关部队、工厂、学校已做到蔬菜自给。
    本报呼和浩特25日电　内蒙古自治区杭锦后旗永胜人民公社民丰大队家畜家禽饲养业蓬勃发展。到今年6月底，猪比去年同期增长了一点三六倍，鸡增长了一点三九倍，兔子增长了五倍多，羊增长了18％。目前每户社员平均有猪三点九只、兔子十九点三只、鸡十一点一只、羊五点七只。
    永胜公社民丰大队位于阴山南麓的河套平原上。这里土地肥沃，渠道纵横，除粮食作物外，野菜和牧草丛生，是一片丰美的半农半牧地带。今年入春以来，全队六百户人家，在公社党委的领导下，贯彻执行了公养和私养同时并举的方针，社员们饲养家畜家禽的积极性空前高涨。他们采取自繁自养，分级饲养，妥善安排劳动力，广开饲料来源，大力防治病害和互助协作等办法，使家畜家禽饲养业得到了迅速的发展。现在大队有三个养猪场、两个养兔场；小队有十九个养猪场，一个养鸡场。社员们除极少数的单身汉外，家家户户都有了成群的鸡兔和肥壮的生猪。
    民丰大队在发展家畜家禽生产中很重视禽畜管理，社员们都按生猪的大小、公母、强弱和品种等，实行了分圈饲养管理和定期清扫、垫圈、消毒，以保持圈净、槽净、食净和猪身干净。公养或私养的鸡、兔群，也都有了安全的鸡窝和兔窝，以免其他动物的侵害。在饲草饲料方面，除采集各种野草野菜外，还利用农业副产物和在林地、荒地上播种了猪饲料。为了防治疫病发生，入春以来已进行了三次猪瘟、猪肺疫的预防注射，并每隔五天到七天对猪圈和食具等做一次全面消毒和检查。目前，这里已成为家畜家禽的无疫区。
    民丰大队对扩大家畜家禽种源也很重视，在配种接产工作方面，这个队实行的以圈编号和配种卡片等，使生猪改良和接产工作能有计划地进行，避免了过去母猪流产、早产和压死等损失。另外，这个队还采用重配、双配等办法，使仔猪产的多，生的壮，并迅速推广了良种。
    为了进一步发展家畜家禽的生产，大队已设立猪鸡兔生产委员会，由大队长、自治区劳动模范王俊义领导。各小队也成立了猪鸡兔生产小组，领导和带动社员掀起一个人人动手，家家饲养的热潮。（附图片）
