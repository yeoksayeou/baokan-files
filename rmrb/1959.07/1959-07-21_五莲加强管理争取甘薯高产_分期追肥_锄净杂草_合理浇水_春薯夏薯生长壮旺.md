Jinan, July 20th (Our Newspaper) – The people of Wulian County are meticulously strengthening field management of sweet potatoes, a crop with high yields and a wide range of uses, striving for even higher yields of this high-yielding crop.

Wulian County is one of the counties in Shandong Province with a relatively large area of sweet potato cultivation and rich cultivation experience. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, through the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and various comparative experiments, sweet potato cultivation techniques have been further enriched, resulting in even better managed sweet potatoes this year. Currently, among the 250,000 mu of sweet potatoes in the county, about half of the spring sweet potatoes have covered the ground with vines, and most have formed tubers; more than 13,000 mu of summer sweet potatoes are also growing vigorously, with the early-planted ones already having vines more than a foot long.

The county's experience in managing sweet potatoes mainly focuses on grasping the three key aspects of fertilizer, weeding, and water, and applying fertilizer, weeding, and watering flexibly and meticulously based on the weather, soil, and crop conditions. In terms of fertilization, they apply different fertilizers according to the different needs of the early and later stages of sweet potato growth. The early topdressing, starting from the seedling survival stage, focuses on nitrogen fertilizer to promote vine growth and root development; the later topdressing, starting from the tuber formation stage, focuses on potassium fertilizer to promote tuber enlargement. Topdressing should use thin fertilizer as much as possible (early stage uses thin manure made from fermented human and animal waste or chemical fertilizer solution; later stage uses thin manure made from fermented livestock manure or manure made from raw materials such as chicken manure and soybean meal). Thin fertilizer is easier to apply, easier to decompose, and also functions as watering. At the same time, fertilization should also consider the soil type. The fertilization methods also differ between the early and later stages. In the early stage, it is best to apply fertilizer by punching holes near the base of the plant or digging small pits; in the later stage, it is best to apply fertilizer along the soil cracks where the sweet potato tubers are expanding. This way, the fertilizer is concentrated, and the roots and seedlings are not damaged.

"Weeding" is also very important for increasing sweet potato production. But the key is to weed well three times to ensure that the land is free of weeds and the soil is not compacted. After the seedlings survive, the root area is compacted due to watering during transplanting, affecting root growth and leaf development. It is necessary to seize the time to weed for the first time to loosen the soil, conserve moisture, increase soil temperature, and promote rooting. Therefore, they call the first weeding the "seedling-promoting weeding," and it must be done regardless of whether there are weeds or not. During weeding, it is necessary to weed carefully and skillfully, first breaking up the compacted soil around the seedlings, and then weeding lightly to prevent excessive soil around the roots from affecting tuber formation. The second weeding is for weeding and loosening the soil. If this weeding is done well, more tubers can be formed; if it is not done in time, many weeds will affect tuber formation. For the second weeding, the bottom of the ditch should be as deep as possible, and the ridges should be as shallow as possible. During weeding, pay attention to removing the fibrous roots by hand. When the tubers have already formed, some are exposed on the surface, and some mounds have collapsed due to expansion, and when the elongated vines are about to take root, seize the time to weed for the third time; and combine this with earthing up and closing the ridges, burying the exposed sweet potatoes and cutting off the fibrous roots, concentrating the soil fertility so that the sweet potato tubers become large and plump. Be especially careful when weeding to prevent damage to the roots and seedlings. At the same time, weeding should be done based on the weather and soil moisture; it is not good to weed when it is too wet or too dry. As the local proverb says: "Weed cotton when it's wet, weed vegetables when it's dry, weed sweet potatoes when it's neither dry nor wet."

Watering should be skillful. Sweet potatoes should not be irrigated with large amounts of water; they should be watered frequently and lightly. In self-flowing irrigation areas, generally about 20 cubic meters of water is applied per mu each time, or one furrow is watered every other furrow; in well irrigation areas, water is generally applied along the cracks in the soil where the tubers are expanding.

Currently, all people's communes in Wulian County have formulated effective measures to strive for increased production based on these experiences, adapting to the time and local conditions. Generally, rich-yielding fields are planned to be topdressed two to three times, and general fields are topdressed once to twice, with each application using two to three thousand jin of thin manure per mu. At present, the vast masses of the county have launched an intense and enthusiastic field management competition of accumulating and applying thin manure on the spot. More than 64,000 mu have been topdressed throughout the county. Spring sweet potatoes have been weeded twice, and summer sweet potatoes have also been weeded once. At the same time, the production teams of various people's communes attach great importance to the leadership of large-area high-yielding fields. A total of 110,000 mu of high-yielding fields have been established throughout the county, accounting for 44% of all sweet potato land.

### 五莲加强管理争取甘薯高产  分期追肥　锄净杂草　合理浇水　春薯夏薯生长壮旺

    五莲加强管理争取甘薯高产
    分期追肥　锄净杂草　合理浇水　春薯夏薯生长壮旺
    本报济南20日电　五莲县人民正对产量高、用途广的甘薯，细致地加强田间管理，力争高产作物更高产。
    五莲县是山东种植甘薯比较多、栽培经验比较丰富的县份之一。去年大跃进以来，经过贯彻“八字宪法”，多方面对比试验，更充实了甘薯的栽培技术，因而今年管理的甘薯也更加出色。现在全县二十五万亩甘薯中，约有一半的春甘薯已叶蔓满地，大部分结了薯块；一万三千多亩夏甘薯也块块苗子旺盛，早栽的已伸出一尺多长的薯蔓。
    这个县管理甘薯的经验，主要是抓住肥、锄、水三关，看天、看地、看苗灵活细致地施肥、锄草、浇水。在施肥方面，他们根据甘薯生长前、后两期需要不同，追施不同肥料。前期追肥从秧苗成活开始，多追氮肥，催促长蔓生根；后期从薯块形成开始，多追钾肥，促使薯块肥大。追肥要尽量用稀肥
  （前期追浇人粪尿沤制的粪稀或化肥水；后期追浇牲畜粪尿沤制的粪稀或用鸡粪、豆面等原料制造的粪稀），稀肥好追，好分解，还起浇水作用。同时，追肥还要看土用肥。在追肥方法上，前后期也有不同。前期最好按墩打眼、扒窝追施；后期最好顺着甘薯块攻破的土缝追施。这样，肥力既集中，还不伤根动秧。
      “锄”对甘薯增产关系也非常大。但关键在锄好三遍，保证地无杂草，土不板结。在秧苗成活后，因插秧时点水封墩，根部板结一块，影响生根发叶，必须抓紧锄第一遍，以松土保墒，增加地温，促使扎根。因此第一遍他们叫作“催苗锄”，有无杂草都得锄。锄时必须细锄巧锄，把封秧的土墩先拍碎，然后再轻锄，防止根部拥土过多，影响结薯块。第二遍是锄草松土。这一遍锄好了，就可以多结薯；锄得不及时，杂草多，影响结薯。锄第二遍，沟底越深越好，垅埂越浅越好。锄时要注意边锄边用手把毛根弄掉。在薯块已座好，有的露出地皮，有的瓜墩被胀塌，伸长的薯蔓也要扎根的时候，要抓紧锄第三遍；并结合培土封垄，把露出的甘薯埋上，把毛根截断，集中地力，使甘薯块块肥大。锄地时要特别细心，严防伤根伤秧。同时要看天看墒下锄，湿了干了都不好锄。这里的农谚说：“湿锄棉花干锄菜，不干不湿锄地瓜”（甘薯在山东叫地瓜）。
    浇水要巧。甘薯不能放大水浇灌，要勤浇、轻浇。在自流灌溉区，一般每次每亩浇水二十方左右，或者隔一垄浇一垄；井灌区一般顺着瓜块裂的地缝浇。
    现在五莲县各人民公社，都已根据这些经验，因时因地逐块制定了争取超产的有力措施。一般计划丰产田追肥二至三次，一般田追肥一至二次，每次每亩要浇稀粪二至三千斤。目前这个县的广大群众已经紧张烈热地展开了大积稀肥，随积随追的田间管理竞赛。全县已追肥六万四千多亩。春薯已锄过二遍，夏薯也锄过一遍。同时，各人民公社的生产队，都十分重视大面积丰产田的领导。全县共搞丰产田十一万亩，占全部甘薯地的44％。
