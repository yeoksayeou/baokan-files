    Beijing to Build a New Textile Engineering Institute
    The former Cadre School of the Ministry of Textile Industry is about to be reorganized into the Beijing Textile Engineering Institute. The school plans to temporarily establish two departments: Textile and Dyeing & Chemical Engineering. These departments will have two specialties: Textile Engineering and Printing & Dyeing, both with a four-year academic program. Enrollment is scheduled to begin this summer.
    In order to facilitate the combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, the Beijing Textile Engineering Institute has selected a site in Houbalizhuang, near the Beijing No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 Cotton Textile Factories and the Textile Science Research Institute, to build the school. In the future, in addition to constructing teaching and practice workshops and various laboratories, the institute can also make use of the experimental factories and various equipment of the cotton textile factories and the Textile Science Research Institute in the vicinity for production practice and scientific research.

    北京将新建一所纺织工学院
    原纺织工业部干部学校即将改建为北京纺织工学院。该校准备暂设纺织和染化二系，下设纺织工程和印染两个专业，学制均为四年，并定于今年暑期开始招生。
    为了便于教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合，北京纺织工学院已择定在北京东郊棉纺一、二、三厂和纺织科学研究院附近的后八里庄建校。将来该院除建设教学实习工场和各种实验室外，还可以就近利用棉纺厂和纺织科学研究院的实验工厂及各种设备进行生产实习和科学研究。
