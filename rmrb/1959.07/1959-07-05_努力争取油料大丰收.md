    While striving for a bumper grain harvest, we must also strive for a bumper oilseed harvest to meet the people's need for cooking oil.
    Oilseed production, like other agricultural products, is growing year by year. In the last year of the First Five-Year Plan, the output of several major oil crops increased by 86% compared to 1949. In 1958, oilseeds, like grain and cotton, achieved a great leap forward, and some large-scale high yields appeared. The output of woody oilseeds has also increased significantly.
    However, oilseed production is still far from meeting the growing needs of the people. Supplying one catty of cooking oil per person per month is not much, but calculated from the national population of 650 million, 7.8 billion catties of cooking oil are needed annually. Assuming 400 catties of peanuts produce 100 catties of oil, then 31.2 billion catties of peanuts are needed. Assuming 200 catties of sesame produce 100 catties of oil, then 15 to 16 billion catties of sesame are needed. The oil yield of soybeans and cottonseed is even lower, so the needs are even greater. And people's demand for cooking oil is growing rapidly. For example, consumption in 1958 increased by 36.2% compared to 1957. Therefore, oilseed production must accelerate and strive for a leap forward.
    There are many ways to increase oilseed production: planting annual herbaceous oilseeds and perennial woody oilseeds to produce more vegetable oil; developing livestock to increase the production of animal fats, these aspects also have great potential. However, the production of woody oilseeds and animal fats takes a relatively long time. For example, although oil tea and walnuts can flower and bear fruit two or three years after planting, it takes seven or eight years for mass production. Currently, the most effective method is to develop the production of herbaceous oil crops such as peanuts, soybeans, and sesame.
    There are two ways to increase the production of soybeans, peanuts, sesame, etc.: one is to expand the planting area of these crops and implement multiple plantings for multiple harvests; the other is to do everything possible to increase the yield per unit area after planting. The rapeseed sown last winter saw a slight reduction in planting area but a significant increase in yield per unit area. The area of spring-sown soybeans, sesame, flax, sunflowers, etc., has not decreased, and has even increased in a few areas, but peanuts have not been able to complete the planting plan due to seed frost damage, reduced germination capacity, and other reasons. Now, various places are actively expanding the planting area of summer sesame and other crops. Under such circumstances, on the one hand, we should continue to sow summer sesame and soybeans, and on the other hand, we must try every means to maintain the existing planting area, so that we harvest every acre we plant. One of the most important issues in maintaining the existing planting area is that the oilseed crop fields with poor emergence and many missing seedlings must not be abandoned. Of course, poor emergence will affect oilseed yield, but that is only one aspect; on the other hand, missing seedlings can be replanted, and replanting will result in full stands. Even if seedlings cannot be replanted, other oilseed crops can be replanted. This is also a way to expand the planting area and increase oilseed production. If it is really impossible to replant oilseed crops due to seed and other problems, other crops such as corn can also be intercropped. Doing so, even if the oilseed harvest is a little less, it is much better than not harvesting at all, and it is only beneficial to the country and the peasants.
    Strengthening field management and increasing yield per unit area is currently the most important way to increase oilseed production. Given the poor foundation of this year's oilseed crops, it is even more necessary to strengthen field management. Sichuan farmers have a saying: "Peanuts depend entirely on people to cultivate, planting and management determine 60% of the harvest, only when management is done well, will multiple increases in production come." This means that field management can determine 60% of the oilseed harvest. Because Ziyang County in Sichuan Province strengthened field management of peanuts last year, the 100,000 mu of peanuts yielded twice as much as the previous year. Can the yield of oilseed crops still be increased this year? The answer is yes, not only can it be increased generally, but it can also be increased greatly. The yield per unit area of oilseed crops is still not high, and it is still far from the highest yield per unit area that has appeared in various places last year. If we strive to increase the yield per unit area by 10% to 20% this year on the basis of last year, the country can increase production by several billion catties. This is a remarkable figure. There is truly great potential in oilseed production.
    Based on the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, field management should be strengthened according to the characteristics of oilseed crops, only in this way can it be guaranteed that the output will have a relatively large increase. Oilseed crops have common characteristics: successive flowering and successive fruiting, which provides a favorable condition for field management work, allowing us to keep up step by step, apply more fertilizer, and weed more, so as to promote oilseed crops to bloom more flowers and bear more fruits. Oilseed crops also have different characteristics, and different measures should be taken for management. Sesame is most afraid of waterlogging, so special attention should be paid to flood prevention and waterlogging drainage; during the flowering period of soybeans, appropriate moisture should be maintained regularly, otherwise, it will affect the increase in yield; to achieve a large increase in peanut production, more topdressing and more soil cultivation are necessary.
    However, the most decisive factor in increasing the yield of oilseed crops is people. That is, whether people attach as much importance to oilseed production as they do to grain production, and whether they care as much about oilseed production as they do about grain production? If the leadership attaches importance to it, oilseed production can leap forward. The main reason why Shanghai Oil Crop Research Institute achieved a bumper harvest of rapeseed this year is that the leadership attached importance to rapeseed production. But from the current situation, except for a few major oilseed crop producing areas, most areas do not pay much attention to oilseed production, for example, some people say: "Peanuts will naturally put down needles (gynophores penetrate the soil) when the time comes, and you can get 200 catties even if you don't care." It is right to attach importance to grain production, "food is the paramount necessity of the people," grain is a necessary material for people's lives, everyone needs it, and it is needed every day; it is needed for daily consumption, and it is also needed for production and construction. This is why our party has repeatedly emphasized ensuring that the grain marshal takes command. But people's lives are diverse, and after the grain problem is solved, there is a need for cooking oil and other things. "The seven necessities of life: firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, tea," illustrate this point. The amount of oil used in industrial construction is also considerable. How can it be said that oilseed production is not important? It can only be said that, with the development of industrial and agricultural production and with the improvement of people's lives, its status is getting higher and higher!
    In order for people to eat more cooking oil, and also to meet the needs of industrial oil, we must do everything possible to strive for a greater leap forward in oilseed production!

### 努力争取油料大丰收

    努力争取油料大丰收
    在努力争取粮食丰收的同时，还必须努力争取油料的丰收，以满足全国人民对食油的需要。
    油料生产，同其他农产品一样，是在一年年地增长着的。第一个五年计划最末一年，几种主要油料作物的产量，同1949年比较，增长86％。1958年油料和粮棉一样获得了大跃进，并且出现了一些大面积丰产。木本油料产量，也有显著的增加。
    但是，油料的生产，还是远远不能满足全国人民日益增长的需要。以每人每月供应一斤食油来说，并不算多，但是从全国六亿五千万人口来计算，全年就需要供应七十八亿斤食油。以四百斤花生榨一百斤油来计算，就要三百一十二亿斤花生，以二百多斤芝麻榨一百斤油来计算，就要一百五、六十亿斤芝麻。大豆、棉籽的出油率更低，需要量就更多。而人们对食油的要求，又是在迅速地增长着的。例如1958年的消费量就比1957年增长了36.2％。因此，油料生产，必须快马加鞭，努力跃进。
    增产油料的途径很多，种植一年生的草本油料和多年生的木本油料，多多生产植物油；发展牲畜，努力增产动物油脂，这些方面的潜力也都很大。但是木本油料和动物油脂生产，都需要比较长的时间。例如油茶和核桃虽然种植两三年后即可开花结果，但是大量生产，还得有七、八年的时间。当前，最有效的方法，就是发展草本油料作物即花生、大豆、芝麻等生产。
    增加大豆、花生、芝麻等生产方法有二，一是扩大这些作物的播种面积，实行多种多收；二是播种以后，千方百计地提高单位面积产量。去冬播种的油菜，播种面积有所减少，单位面积产量有很大的提高。春季播种的大豆、芝麻、胡麻、向日葵等，面积没有减少，少数地区还有所增加，只是花生，由于种子受冻，发芽能力减退，以及其他原因，还没有能够完成播种计划。现在各地正在积极扩大夏芝麻等播种面积。在这样的情况下，一方面继续播种夏芝麻、大豆，一方面要想尽一切办法，保持已有的播种面积，做到种一亩，收一亩。保持已有的播种面积中的最重要的一个问题，是对出苗不好和缺苗较多的油料作物田地，坚决不能废弃。当然，出苗不好，是会影响油料的产量，但是，这只是一个方面；另一个方面，缺苗还可以补苗，补苗以后就是全苗。即便不能补苗，也可以补种其他油料作物。这也是扩大播种面积，增加油料生产的办法。实在因为种子等等问题不能补种油料作物，也可以套种其他农作物，如玉米等。这样做，即便油料少收一点，也比不收好得多，对国家、对农民，也都是只有好处没有坏处。
    加强田间管理，提高单位面积产量，是当前增加油料生产的最重要的一个方法。从今年油料作物基础不够好的情况来看，更加需要加强田间管理。四川农民中有一种说法：“花生全靠人来栽，种管工夫四六开，只要管理做到家，成倍增产才会来。”这就是说，田间管理可以决定油料作物的六成收成。四川资阳县去年因为狠狠抓了一下花生的田间管理，十万亩花生比前年增产一倍。今年油料作物的产量还可不可以提高呢？答复是肯定的，不仅可以一般地提高，而且可以很大地提高。油料作物的单位面积产量还是不高的，同去年各地已经出现的最高的单位面积产量比较，还差得很多。今年如果在去年的基础上争取把单位面积产量提高10％到20％，全国就可以增产几十亿斤。这是一个了不起的数字。油料生产真是大有可为。
    根据去年大跃进的经验，应该根据油料作物的特点，来加强田间管理，只有这样，才能保证产量有比较大的增加。油料作物有共同的特点：陆续开花、陆续结实，这给田间管理工作一个有利的条件，可以步步跟上，多施肥多锄草，促使油料作物开更多的花，结更多的实。油料作物又有不同的特点，还要采用不同的措施进行管理。芝麻，最怕水淹，因此要特别注意防涝排渍工作；大豆开花期间，要经常保持适当水分，否则，要影响产量的增加；要花生大量增产，就要多追肥多培土。
    但是，增加油料作物产量的最有决定性的因素还是人。就是人们是不是像重视粮食生产一样来重视油料生产，是不是像关心粮食生产一样来关心油料生产？领导上重视了，油料生产就可以跃进。今年上海市油菜所以获得丰收，主要原因是领导上重视油菜生产。但是从目前情况看，除了少数油料作物主要产区以外，多数地区对油料生产是不大重视的，比如有人说：“花生到时自下针（子房柄深入土内），不管也拿二百斤”。重视粮食生产是对的，“民以食为天”，粮食是人们生活的必需物资，人人需要，天天需要；生活消费需要，生产建设也需要。我们党所以一再强调确保粮食元帅升帐，理由也就在此。但是人们的生活是多样的，在粮食问题解决之后，就要食油等等东西。“开门七件事，柴、米、油、盐、酱、醋、茶。”就说明了这一点。工业建设用油量也不少。怎么能认为油料生产不重要呢？只能说，油料，随着工农业生产的发展，随着人民生活的改善，它的地位越来越高了！
    为了让人们吃到更多的食油，也为了满足工业用油，就一定要千方百计地争取油料生产更大的跃进！
