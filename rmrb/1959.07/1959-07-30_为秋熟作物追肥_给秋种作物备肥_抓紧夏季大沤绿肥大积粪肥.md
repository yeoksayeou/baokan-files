Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: Across the country, people are seizing the favorable opportunities of abundant summer grass, plentiful straw, high temperatures, and rapid decomposition to actively carry out fertilizer accumulation and production campaigns.

Currently, autumn crops urgently need topdressing, and autumn sowing requires the preparation of base fertilizer. Party committees in Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang provinces and regions have successively requested that all localities seize the great opportunity of summer fertilizer accumulation and production, immediately take action, and launch a summer fertilizer accumulation and production campaign with the mobilization of every household and the participation of everyone. The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee held a broadcast conference, requiring all localities to do everything possible to ensure the success of summer fertilizer accumulation and production. Many regions have also strengthened leadership over fertilizer accumulation and production and rationally arranged labor. Most counties in the Shandong Province's Liaocheng, Changwei, Jining, and Linyi regions have established leadership organizations for fertilizer accumulation and production. In Anhui Province's Taihu County, from the county party committee to the people's commune party committees, a party secretary or deputy secretary is assigned to lead fertilizer accumulation and production work. Provinces and regions such as Jiangxi, Anhui, Guangxi, Henan, and Jiangsu have all transferred a certain amount of labor to focus on fertilizer accumulation and production.

During the summer fertilizer accumulation and production campaign, the main focus is on vigorously decomposing green manure and actively promoting high-temperature composting. Many places are combining autumn field cultivation and weeding with the decomposition of green manure. Chengwu County in Shandong Province has combined cultivation and weeding with the decomposition of a large amount of green manure. Yingju People's Commune's Yingju Brigade in Fengqiu County, Henan Province, launched a "Thousands of Mu, Hundreds of Ponds" liquid fertilizer production campaign, digging pits on the spot, pulling weeds on the spot, using water from the canals, and decomposing on the spot, which saves labor, speeds up decomposition, and increases fertilizer effectiveness.

Many people's communes are also combining the summer sanitation campaign to mobilize commune members to collect large amounts of household manure and stable manure. Many people's communes in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, and Zhejiang provinces have newly built and repaired a large number of toilets, manure pits, and livestock pens to accumulate more fertilizer. Dancheng County in Henan Province mobilized commune members to accumulate and produce a large amount of fertilizer in just over a month, which, in addition to providing topdressing for the county's autumn crops, also prepared sufficient fertilizer for the county's planned planting of more than 1.2 million mu of wheat this year. In Zhejiang Province, Jiaxing City and Wenzhou City have accumulated a large amount of human manure, pig, cattle, sheep, chicken, and duck manure, and have also accumulated and cleaned up a lot of garbage, ditch mud, and other fertilizers to send to the suburbs to support agricultural production in the past two to three months.

During this fertilizer accumulation and production campaign, many people's communes in Hunan, Yunnan, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces and regions have implemented the principle of pay according to work and more pay for more work. For collectively accumulated fertilizer, work points are assessed according to quality and quantity, and rewards are given for exceeding the quota; for fertilizer accumulated by individual commune members, prices are determined based on quality, and cash is paid or work points are recorded. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members for accumulating and producing fertilizer has been encouraged.

During the summer concentrated fertilizer accumulation and production effort, many people's communes have calculated the needs for autumn field topdressing and autumn planting base fertilizer, established a fertilizer accumulation and production responsibility system, implemented a system of cadres responsible for areas and commune members responsible for plots, and accumulated and produced the required fertilizer for each plot of land according to quality, quantity, and time. Many people's communes in various places have also combined the widespread mobilization of the masses for concentrated efforts with the establishment of professional teams to regularly carry out fertilizer accumulation and production, and combined collective and individual fertilizer accumulation and production. These measures have effectively promoted fertilizer accumulation and production work. (Attached picture)

    为秋熟作物追肥　给秋种作物备肥
    抓紧夏季大沤绿肥大积粪肥
    据新华社29日讯　全国各地正在抓紧夏季草多、秸秆多、温度高、腐热快等积肥造肥的有利时机，积极开展积肥造肥运动。
    当前，秋季农作物正迫切需要追肥，秋种需要准备底肥。河南、河北、陕西和新疆等省区的党委，先后要求各地抓紧夏季积肥造肥的大好时机，立即行动起来，掀起一个户户动员、人人动手的夏季积肥造肥运动。中共浙江省委召开了广播大会，要求各地千方百计抓好夏季积肥造肥工作。许多地区还加强了对积肥造肥工作的领导，合理地安排了劳动力。山东省聊城、昌潍、济宁、临沂等专区的大部分县，建立了积肥造肥的领导机构。安徽省太湖县从县委到人民公社党委，都确定一名党委书记或副书记分工领导积肥造肥工作。江西、安徽、广西、河南、江苏等省区，都抽调一定数量的劳动力突击积肥造肥。
    各地在夏季积肥造肥运动中，主要是大力沤制绿肥和积极推行高温堆肥。许多地方结合秋田中耕除草沤制绿肥。山东省成武县结合中耕除草沤制了大量绿肥。河南省封丘县应举人民公社应举大队，开展了“千亩百池”造汤肥运动，就地挖坑，就地拔草，就渠用水，就地沤制，既省劳力，又沤的快，肥效也大。
  许多地方的人民公社还结合夏季卫生运动，发动社员大量收集家肥厩肥。河南、河北、山东、湖北、浙江等省的许多人民公社，新建和修建了大量厕所、粪坑、牲畜圈栏，多积肥料。河南省郸城县发动公社社员，在一个多月内，积蓄和制造了大量肥料，除供全县秋熟作物追肥外，还为今年全县计划种植的一百二十多万亩小麦准备了充足的肥料。浙江省的嘉兴市、温州市在最近的两三个月内，积攒了大量的人粪尿、猪、牛、羊、鸡、鸭肥，还积攒和清理了很多垃圾、阴沟泥等肥料送到郊区支援农业生产。
    在这次积肥造肥运动中，湖南、云南、四川、内蒙古、黑龙江、河南、山东等省区的许多人民公社，都贯彻了按劳计酬、多劳多得的原则。对于集体积的肥料，按质按量评定工分，超过定额的给予奖励；对于社员个人所积的肥料，则按质论价，现款收购或评记工分。因此，鼓励了广大社员积肥造肥的积极性。
    在夏季突击积肥造肥中，许多地方的人民公社都算了秋田追肥和秋种底肥的帐，建立了积肥造肥责任制度，实行干部包片，社员包丘，按质、按量、按时积造每丘田所需要的肥料。各地还有许多的人民公社，把普遍发动群众突击与成立专业队伍经常进行积肥造肥相结合，把集体与个人的积肥造肥相结合。这些措施都有力地推动了积肥造肥工作。（附图片）
