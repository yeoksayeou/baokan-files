    Summer has come to the Beijing Zoo, and many of the birds and beasts in the zoo are showing a lively appearance. Some have changed into bright feathers, and some have put on simple and elegant clothing. Summer is also the breeding season for most animals. The cubs are close to their mothers. The arctic fox, which lives in extremely cold regions, also gave birth to six little foxes this year. These little white foxes don't know that their hometown is the icy and snowy Arctic! In the small zoo, the Australian kangaroos are also secretly poking their heads out of their mother's pouch to look around. The newly born lynx in the beast house looks so much like a domestic cat, but its tail is very short and it has two tufts of hair on its ears.
    The waterfowl lake, with its green waves and shady green willows, is the best place for people to cool off and enjoy the summer. Various waterfowl and pairs of mandarin ducks swim in the lotus bushes. The small islands with weeds in the lake are good places for wild ducks, geese, mandarin ducks and other birds to lay eggs and breed. People can often hear clear bird sounds and the "hehe" of cranes on the lake shore.
    Hippos, rhinos, and zebras from tropical Africa have long left their beast houses and spend almost the whole day entertaining visitors on the exercise field. Although the giraffe is a tropical animal, it doesn't seem to like being in the hot sun, but stays in the arboreal forest all day long. Only the giant hippopotamus is always happily rolling in the sun-drenched pool with its mouth wide open. Last year, they didn't have the chance to come outdoors for a water bath, but this year is different.
    The rise in temperature has greatly increased the large python's appetite in recent days. The Yangtze crocodile, which had been sleeping like death for a while, has also begun to open its mouth and slowly wriggle.
    These days, the zoo is renovating the outdoor shaded exercise field for a pair of lively and interesting chimpanzees. But the polar bear from the Arctic has broken the old rules this year and no longer needs any shading equipment. This is because over the years, the climate in Beijing has basically changed their fear of heat. Even in the hot noon, they are still actively soaking in the water and throwing wooden balls with their forepaws.
    The twenty or so beasts in the lion, tiger, and leopard mountain appear on the exercise field all day long, but the large Siberian tiger looks lazy and lies motionless in the bushes. Even the tropical African lion is unwilling to be exposed to the scorching sun.
    The delicate panda can only go to the exercise field to play for a while in the early morning, and cannot leave its air-conditioned panda pavilion for a moment at other times. Even though it is not too hot now, it still seems to have difficulty swallowing its food at lunch, and pants with its mouth wide open. (Attached picture)

    北京动物园的夏天
    蒋绍仲
    夏天来到了北京动物园，园里的许多鸟兽都显出一副生气活泼的样子。有的换上了鲜艳的羽毛，有的穿上了朴素大方的服装。夏天，又是大部分动物繁殖的季节。仔兽紧紧依偎在妈妈身旁。长在严寒地区的白狐，今年也生了六只小狐。这些小白狐们哪里知道自己的家乡却是那冰天雪地的北极！小动物园里的澳洲袋鼠也从母亲的育儿袋里偷偷地探出头来张望。在猛兽室内刚出生不久的小猞猁长得多么像家猫，只是尾巴很短，耳朵上多了两撮毛。
    在绿波荡漾、绿柳成荫的水禽湖畔，是人们消暑乘凉的最好地方。各种水禽和对对鸳鸯在荷丛中游来游去，湖内杂草丛生的小岛是野鸭、鸿雁、鸳鸯等生卵繁殖的好地方。人们在湖畔不时清晰地听到清脆的鸟声和“呵呵”的鹤鸣。
    来自热带非洲的河马、犀牛、斑马早已离开了兽室，差不多整天都在运动场上招待游客。长颈鹿虽是热带动物，但它似乎不太喜欢在烈日之下，而是整天躲在乔木林里。只有那巨型的河马，总是张着大嘴高兴的翻滚在被烈日曝晒的水池里。去年它们还没有机会到室外来水浴，今年却不同了。
  气温的升高使大蟒近日的食量大增。前一阵像死一般沉睡的扬子鳄，也开始张开大嘴慢慢地蠕动了。
    近些天动物园正为一对活泼有趣的黑猩猩改建室外避荫的运动场。但来自北极的白熊，今年却打破了陈规，再不需要什么避荫设备。这是因为几年来，北京气候已使它们基本上改变了怕热的习性，在炎热的中午它们也同样活泼地泡在水里用前掌投掷着木球。
    狮虎豹山里的二十余只猛兽，虽然整天都出现在运动场上，但大型的东北虎却显出懒洋洋的样子，卧在灌木丛中一动不动，就连热带的非洲狮也同样不愿曝晒在烈日之下。
    娇气十足的熊猫，只有在清晨到运动场上玩一会，其余时间一刻也不能离开它那有冷气设备的熊猫馆。即使现在还不算太热，但它吃午饭时还似乎菜饭难咽，张着大嘴直喘。（附图片）
