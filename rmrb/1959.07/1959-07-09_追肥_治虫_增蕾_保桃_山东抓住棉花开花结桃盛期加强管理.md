This Newspaper Jinan, July 8th: Shandong's broad masses of cotton farmers, on the basis of achieving full and robust cotton seedling growth, are actively carrying out a cotton field management campaign centered on topdressing and pest control.

Currently, most of Shandong Province's eleven million mu of cotton has grown to a height of about one chi, with four to six fruit branches, flowering and setting bolls seven or eight days earlier than in previous years; the 500,000 mu of cotton that was transplanted earlier is even more lush with flowers and bolls, each plant having grown two or three old peaches.

This year, all parts of Shandong attach great importance to cotton field management. The main cotton-producing areas of Liaocheng and Zibo regions have respectively convened on-site meetings attended by county party secretaries, county heads, agricultural and forestry bureau chiefs, and key cotton-producing commune secretaries in charge of cotton production. The Liaocheng region organized five inspection teams to inspect the cotton management of fifteen counties and cities, forty-two communes, and more than one hundred production brigades, and formulated various management measures centered on "grasping the pre-summer peaches firmly, grasping the summer peaches skillfully, and grasping the autumn peaches greatly," and carried out a region-wide mobile red flag competition among counties, communes, and production teams. By the end of June, the region's 5.08 million mu of cotton had generally been hoed two to three times, and more than half had been topdressed with 1,500 to 21,000 jin of fertilizer per mu.

In cotton field management, people's communes in various places attach great importance to disaster prevention, resistance to disasters, boll protection, and peach protection. After the detection of cotton aphid infestations in Linqing City in early June, more than 317,000 laborers were immediately organized to adopt the method of assigning responsibility by area to launch a siege and spray to eliminate the pests, and within only five days, the pest infestation was eliminated in more than 370,000 mu of cotton fields. Cotton farmers in various places have also combined deep plowing and soil cultivation to increase drought prevention irrigation and flood drainage facilities.

During the cotton field management period, support for cotton farmers has also been launched. The province has supplied 240,000 jin of chemical fertilizers for cotton fields by the state, and most of them have been transported to the people's communes in cotton-producing areas. The five An-2 model aircraft supported by the National Civil Aviation Administration for eliminating insect pests will soon fly to Linqing, Gaotang, Xiajin, Linyi, and Gaomi and other cotton field concentration areas. The iron and wood industry factories of the people's communes in various places have also rushed to manufacture a large number of new-style tools for cotton field cultivation, weeding, fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer production, and pest control.

### 追肥　治虫　增蕾　保桃  山东抓住棉花开花结桃盛期加强管理

    山东抓住棉花开花结桃盛期加强管理
    本报济南8日电　山东广大棉农在取得棉苗生长齐全健壮的基础上，正积极开展以追肥、灭虫等为中心的棉花田间管理运动。
    目前，山东省的一千一百万亩棉花，大部分已株高一尺左右，长出果枝四个至六个，比往年提前七、八天开花结铃；提前育苗移栽的五十万亩棉花，更是花铃茂密，每株都长成了两、三个老桃。
    今年山东各地对棉花田间管理都很重视。主要产棉地聊城和淄博专区都分别召开了主管棉花生产的县委书记、县长和农林局长、重点产棉公社书记参加的现场会议。聊城专区组织了五个检查团，分别检查了十五个县市、四十二个公社和一百多个生产大队的棉花管理情况，制订了以“狠抓伏前桃，巧抓伏桃，大抓秋桃”为中心内容的各项管理措施，开展了全区范围的县与县、社与社和生产队之间的流动红旗竞赛运动。这个专区的五百零八万亩棉花，到6月底已普遍锄过两遍至三遍，并有半数以上每亩追施了一千五百至二万一千斤肥料。
    在棉田管理中，各地人民公社都很重视防灾、抗灾、保蕾、保桃工作。临清市在6月上旬发现棉蚜虫情后，立即组织了三十一万七千多名劳力，采取划片包干的办法，向虫害展开围攻喷杀，仅五天内就消灭了三十七万多亩棉田里的虫害。各地棉农还结合中耕培土，增设防旱灌溉和防涝排水的设施。
    在棉花田间管理期间，还展开了对棉农的支援。全省由国家供应棉田的化肥二十四万斤，大部分已运到产棉地区的人民公社。国家民用航空局支援消灭虫孪的五架安二型飞机，最近将飞抵棉田集中区的临清、高唐、夏津、临邑和高密等地。各地人民公社的铁木业工厂，还为棉田中耕锄草、积肥、造肥、防治虫害等赶制了大量的新式工具。
