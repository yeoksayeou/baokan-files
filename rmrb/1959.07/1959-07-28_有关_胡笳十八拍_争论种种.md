Various Debates Concerning "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute"
Li Rong

If "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute" is attributed to Cai Wenji, or even to someone from the Tang Dynasty, it would be more accurate to describe it as oral literature circulating among the people. If it were Cai Wenji's work, why is there no mention of it in her biographies? Why is there no written record of it before the Tang Dynasty? The time and place of Cai Wenji's exile to the Xiongnu people differ from historical facts, and the literary language of the work clearly bears traces of later generations. If it were written by someone from the Tang Dynasty, how could such a moving and heartfelt work be created without genuine thoughts and feelings? Furthermore, compared to Tang Dynasty poetry and prose, it does not resemble the style of the Tang Dynasty.

Saying it is oral literature circulating among the people is because it encapsulates the spiritual outlook of the people who suffered from war during the historical period from the Three Kingdoms to the Song Dynasty. After the late Eastern Han Dynasty, the people were trapped in the long-term suffering of war. The chaos of the Sixteen Kingdoms of the Five Barbarians, the inter-ethnic conflicts, and the disasters suffered by the people were even more indescribable. Families and society were subjected to devastating destruction, and prosperous areas were transformed into desolate battlefields. Class rule and ethnic oppression were naturally extremely cruel, and women suffered even more deeply. Men died in battlefields, and widows and orphans were separated from their homeland and exiled to foreign lands. Wives and children were scattered, separated by vast distances, creating a tragic scene. However, the people's desire for survival was so strong, and their longing for their motherland was even more inextinguishable. It is only natural that people expressed their aspirations in the form of oral literature. "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute" merely reflects the wishes of millions of women.

Oral literature, because it is the collective creation of the masses, often expresses a strong sense of the people in terms of art and content. Its ideology is strong, its language is popular and mass-oriented, and its style is free and full of romantic spirit. "The Peacock Flies Southeast" and "Ballad of Mulan," which have been passed down since the Northern and Southern Dynasties, fully reflect the people's wishes and hopes. They have been circulating orally among the people for a long time, gradually being revised and accumulated into long poems.

Some of China's great works, whose authors are primarily the broad masses, gradually enrich their content through long-term oral circulation and evolution, and are finally refined and processed by literati to become great works. For example, "Water Margin," "Journey to the West," and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" are like this, as are "The Peacock Flies Southeast" and "Ballad of Mulan" mentioned earlier. Since the people suffered from the pain of displacement and death in the late Eastern Han Dynasty, it is certainly possible and natural to compile poems reflecting their own wishes by using Cai Wenji's experience. We see that many folk tales and oral literature use a certain story as a metaphor to express the characteristics of the people's own wishes. Therefore, we believe that "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute" may also have followed such a path. "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute" has a long creative process. The initial creation was among the people, and after a long period of circulation, it was finally revised into a written work.

When studying literary works, the first thing we should look at is its tendency, artistry, ideological content, and its impact on the masses. All excellent works are our valuable literary heritage, and we should not be biased towards or demean them, regardless of who their authors are. On this point, I agree with Comrade Guo Moruo's view on "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute." Now, there is a kind of bias in the research on "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute." Instead of studying it from the literary and artistic aspect of the work itself, the debate is endless on whether the author is Cai Wenji or not. The former uses wishful thinking to raise the value of "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute," while the latter nitpicks words and phrases, citing classics in an attempt to deny it on the grounds that it was not written by Cai Wenji. I don't think this is necessarily the correct attitude towards heritage (of course, we do not object to doing some textual research on certain works). Does whether or not "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute" was written by Cai Wenji affect its artistic value? If so, many literary works will have to be removed from the ranks of excellent works.

    有关“胡笳十八拍”争论种种
    李荣
    胡笳十八拍如果说是蔡文姬所作，或者是唐人所作的话，还不如说是流传于民间的口头文学更为确切一些。如果说是蔡文姬的作品，为什么在蔡文姬的有关传记中没有提及，在唐以前没有见于文字记载，蔡文姬流落到匈奴去的时间、地点与历史事实有出入，而且作品的文学语言也鲜明地有着后代的痕迹。如果说是唐人所作，没有真实的思想感情如何能写出这样动人肺腑的作品来，并且与唐代的诗赋比较，也不像唐人的体裁。
    说是流传于民间的口头文学，是由于它概括了从三国到宋这一段历史时期饱受战争摧残的人民的精神面貌。东汉末年以后，人民陷于长期战争之苦，五胡十六国之乱，种族间的混战，人民所受的灾难更是难言。家庭、社会遭到摧残性的破坏，繁华的地区造成荒凉的疆场，阶级统治、种族压迫自然是非常残酷，而妇女的痛苦更深一层。男子战死在疆场，寡妇孤儿远离故国流落在异域，妻离子散，天各一方，一幅悲惨的景象。但是人民对生存的欲望如此强烈，对祖国的怀念更是不可扑灭，人民以口头文学的形式表达了他们的愿望，这是很自然的事情。胡笳十八拍只是反映了千百万妇女的这种愿望。
    口头文学因为是群众的集体创作，它往往表现在艺术和内容方面，有着强烈的人民性，思想性也强，语言通俗群众化，体裁自由而又富有浪漫精神。从南北朝时期流传下来的孔雀东南飞、木兰辞，都充分反映了人民的意愿和希望，长期在民间口头流传着，由民间歌谣逐渐修补积成大篇。
    我国有些伟大作品，它的作者首先是广大群众，经过长期的口头流传演变逐渐充实内容，最后经过文人的润饰加工而成为伟大的作品。例如水浒传、西游记、三国演义是这样，前面所举的孔雀东南飞、木兰辞也是这样。东汉末年以后，人民既然受着颠沛死亡的痛苦，借蔡文姬的遭遇编成诗篇反映着自己的愿望当然是可以的，也是很自然的事情。我们看许多民间传说、口头文学都是借喻某一个故事而表达了人民自己的愿望的特色。因此我们认为胡笳十八拍可能也是走着这样的道路。胡笳十八拍是有着它的长期创作过程的，最初创作是在民间，经过长期的流传，最后才修饰成文字的作品。
    研究文学作品，我们首先要看的是它的倾向性，艺术性和它的思想内容，以及它对人民群众的影响。历来的优秀作品都是我们宝贵的文学遗产，不论它的作者是谁而从不对它有所偏爱或者加以贬抑。在这一点上我同意郭沫若同志谈胡笳十八拍的看法。现在对胡笳十八拍的研究就有着一种偏向，不是从作品的文学艺术本身来研究它，而是对作者是否系蔡文姬的问题争论不休。前者是用想当然的理由来提高胡笳十八拍的身价，后者却咬文嚼字、挑剔字眼，引经据典企图用不是蔡文姬所作的理由来否定它。我认为这都不一定是对待遗产的正确态度（当然我们也不反对对某些作品做些考证研究工作）。难道胡笳十八拍是否系蔡文姬所作就能影响它本身的艺术价值吗？如果是这样的话，许多文学作品都要从优秀作品的队列中排除出去。
