    Self-Study and Mutual Assistance
    Shi Zhuang
    Learning is a form of intellectual labor. Only by using our brains, repeatedly pondering, progressing step by step, and accumulating knowledge over the long term, can we truly transform learned knowledge into our own. Therefore, in teaching, "self-study should be primary," supplemented by appropriate mutual assistance. Countless examples tell us that those who have achieved profound accomplishments in academics have all gone through a process of diligent research.
    However, "When three men walk together, there must be one who can be my teacher." After all, one's ability is limited. Therefore, in the learning process, there should also be appropriate mutual assistance, mutual questioning, mutual consultation, and mutual inspiration. Departments, sections, and classes in schools can organize students with good grades to help students with poor grades. They can organize everyone to exchange learning experiences and organize various research groups according to students' wishes. However, they must not do everything collectively or discuss everything all the time, which would lead to formalism.
    Some people regard collective mutual assistance as the only way to learn. They even stipulate that students can only study one subject together at a certain time, and then study another subject. This is inappropriate. For example, some students are very good at one subject but very poor at another. According to this method, they cannot focus on arranging their own learning, but will only use their time equally. As for some practices of leveling, they will not cultivate a strong affection for knowledge. If everyone strives to study on their own and learns well, they will be able to think more independently and study diligently, which will also enrich the content of mutual assistance. Therefore, mutual assistance based on self-study is a good learning method. The Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics correctly guides students to study diligently, think independently, and progress step by step according to their learning characteristics. In this way, students' enthusiasm for learning has been consolidated, and a style of self-study as the primary method has been cultivated. Students with poor foundations have made progress; some students received excellent grades for the first time in the final exam. It can be seen that if students can truly study diligently and think independently, they can expect to reap a rich harvest in learning.

    自学与互助
    施庄
    学习是一种思想劳动。只有开动脑筋，反复琢磨，循序渐进，长期积累，才能把学习的知识真正变成自己的东西。因此，在教学中，应该是“自学为主”，辅之以适当的互助。万千个事例告诉我们，在学术上有高深造就的人，都经过了刻苦钻研的历程。
    但是，“三人行，必有我师”，一个人的能力毕竟有限。所以，在学习过程中，也要有适当的互相帮助，互相质疑，互相请教，互相启发。学校各系、科、班可以组织成绩好的学生帮助成绩差的学生，可以组织大家交流学习心得，可以按照学生自愿组织各种研究小组，但决不能事事集体，时时讨论，以致变成形式主义。
    有人把集体互助当作唯一的学习方式。甚至规定在一定的时间里，学生只能共同学习某一门功课，然后再学另一门功课。这样就不妥当了。譬如有的学生这一门功课很好，那一门功课很差，按照这样的办法，他就不可能有重点地安排自己的学习，反而只会平均使用时间。至于某些拉平的作法，那就更培养不出对知识的浓厚的感情了。如果大家努力自学，学习得好些，也就能够更好地独立思考，刻苦钻研，从而也会使互助有了丰富的内容。所以，在自学的基础上进行互助，是良好的学习方法。北京航空学院正确引导学生按照学习特点，刻苦读书，独立思考，循序渐进。这样，学生的学习热情得到了巩固，养成了自学为主的风气。基础较差的学生有了进步；有的学生在期终考试中第一次得到了优良的成绩。可见，学生如果真能刻苦自学，独立思考，自可预期获得学习上的丰收。
