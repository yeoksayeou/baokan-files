    “American Children in the Land of Miracles”
    ——The Soviet Achievements Exhibition in New York Deeply Attracts Countless Young Visitors

    "American Children in the Land of Miracles" is the title of a dispatch from New York by American reporter Rulli, recently published in the Soviet "Labor News." With vivid strokes, the American reporter described how the happy, fresh world introduced by the Soviet Science, Technology, and Culture Achievements Exhibition held in New York deeply imprinted itself on the pure and innocent minds of these young viewers.

    Rulli wrote that the Soviet exhibition was a land of miracles for American children. From the first day it opened, it deeply attracted them. Early in the morning, children flocked to the "Colosseum" building in groups of twos and threes. They scrambled to be "first" in the long queue of visitors and proudly told others, "Humph, we've been here since eight o'clock!" Although the exhibition didn't open until eleven o'clock, they were all proud of arriving early.

    Why were they so eager to come here? To solve this problem, the reporter casually interviewed several young viewers standing in the long line. As soon as the reporter asked them a question, two children shouted almost in unison, "We want to see Russia!" Another child replied with a more composed expression, "I want to see why the Russians are always ahead of us in so many ways..." The reporter asked him, "In what ways?" The child blurted out without thinking, "Well, in controlling the universe, in education, in..."

    As soon as the children ran into the exhibition, whether they were older or younger, they first went straight to the Soviet satellites. They seemed to admire the three satellite replica models, turning around and around them, constantly shouting, "Hey! Look, the dog Laika is sitting in here..." The little mouths couldn't contain the series of questions they wanted to ask for even a second. Some children impatiently dragged their parents' hands, vying to see the "miracles" here and there.

    In the education hall, the children asked the exhibition's guides countless questions: At what age do children in the Soviet Union start school? How many subjects do they have? What do they like best? Is there a lot of homework? Are the teachers very kind? Before the guides could finish answering, they were surrounded by another group of children.

    The theatrical scenes exhibited in the culture hall completely captivated the children. In front of some of the pictures, the reporter heard a very interesting discussion: Several sixteen or seventeen-year-old students stood in front of an oil painting by a Soviet painter, one of whom exclaimed in surprise, "Wow! How good this painting is!" A companion next to him nodded in complete agreement with his opinion, but a third interjected, "Do you remember what our art teacher said, that if a painting looks too much like a painting, then no matter what, it won't work!?" The child's companions laughed mockingly, "That's nonsense!" - one of them boldly retorted - "The teacher only appreciates that abstract garbage, but I just like paintings that look like paintings."

    The reporter wrote that as for what impression the exhibition left on American children, it would be best to find the answer in the messages they wrote in the guestbook in their crooked handwriting!

    "Everything here is lovely, everything is beautiful," little girl Glajis wrote in a little girl's handwriting, "I feel like I have come to Russia." A female student from Claudia Middle School, who looked like she had just started learning Russian, wrote in not-so-proficient Russian letters: "How happy I would be if I could see you."

    The reporter also mentioned a touching message from a "young viewer." This student, whose signature was "a middle school student," wrote immediately after a passage filled with hostility towards the Soviet Union written by a "viewer": "Don't believe his nonsense, we need to know more about your country, our teachers know nothing about your country, or, they know it clearly, but they don't dare to tell us, they are afraid. However, I am truly moved by your achievements, we need to live like you."

    At the entrance of the Soviet exhibition, there was a large slogan: "All people will see that the Soviet plan is a plan for peaceful construction." Few of the children who came to visit could patiently stop to read this slogan when they entered, but after they saw the exhibition, what the slogan said deeply echoed in their pure and young hearts.

### “美国儿童在奇迹之国”——纽约的苏联成就展览会深深吸引了无数小观众

    “美国儿童在奇迹之国”
    ——纽约的苏联成就展览会深深吸引了无数小观众
    “美国儿童在奇迹之国”是苏联“劳动报”最近发表的美国记者鲁利寄自纽约的一篇通讯的标题。这位美国记者以生动的笔触描述了在纽约举行的苏联科学、技术和文化成就展览会所介绍的幸福、新鲜的世界，怎样深深地映入了这些小观众纯洁无邪的心灵中。
    鲁利写道，苏联展览会对美国的儿童来说是一个奇迹之国，从它开幕的第一天，就深深地吸引住了他们，清早，孩子们就三五成群地涌向“科洛西姆”大楼，他们在那长长的观众队伍中，争先恐后地抢占“第一个”，而且骄傲地对别人说：“哼，我们从八点钟就来了！”尽管展览会要十一点钟才开放，可是他们都以早到为荣。
    他们为什么这样热烈地渴望着到这里来呢？为了解决这个问题，记者随便采访了站在长队中的几个小观众。当记者刚向他们提出了问题，两个孩子几乎是异口同声地喊道：“我们要来看一看俄国”。另一个孩子带着比较沉着的神情回答道：“我是为了来看看俄国人究竟为什么总是在很多方面走在我们的前边……”，记者反问他：“在哪些方面呢？”这孩子毫不费思索地冲口而出：“呶，在控制宇宙、在教育、在……”
    孩子们一跑进展览会，无论是年龄稍大些的还是稍小些的，都首先直奔苏联的卫星而去，他们俨然以敬仰的心情围绕着三个卫星的复制模型转来转去，不停地喊着：“喂！快看，小狗莱伊卡就坐在这里面。”……小小的嘴唇一秒钟也不能包住他们那一连串的想要发出的问题，有的孩子极不耐烦地拖着自己父母的手，争着向这里向那里去看“奇迹”。
    在教育馆里，孩子们向展览会的讲解员提出了简直数不清的问题：在苏联几岁就上学？他们有几门功课？他们最喜欢什么？家庭作业多不多？老师们是很可亲的吗？讲解员还没有来得及回答完，又被另一群孩子包围了。
    文化馆中展出的戏剧场面简直把孩子们迷住了。在展出的一些图画面前，记者听到了一番极为有趣的议论：有几个十六、七岁的学生站在一幅苏联画家所作的油画面前，其中有一个惊奇地叫道：“哎咿！这种画该有多好！”他身旁的一个同伴点头表示完全赞同他的看法，可是，第三个又插口说：“你们记得吗，咱们美术老师说过，绘画假若看起来真像画的话，那末无论怎样也是吃不开的！？”这孩子的几个伙伴带有一种嘲笑的神情大笑起来，“那是胡扯！”——他们其中有一个大胆地反驳说——“教员他只欣赏那种抽象派的破烂货，可我就是喜欢这种像画的画”。
    记者写道，至于这个展览会给美国孩子们留下了什么印象，那最好还是从他们自己在留言簿上，用歪歪扭扭的字体所写下的留言中寻找答案吧！
    “在这里一切都可爱，一切都美丽——小女孩格莱吉斯用小姑娘的字体写道——我感到我好像来到了俄国”。克洛迪亚中学的一个女学生看样子刚刚开始学习俄文，她用不太熟练的俄文字母写着：“我能看到你们，该多末高兴”。
    记者还提到了一段动人的“小观众”的留言。这位署名是“一个中学生”的学生在一个“观众”写下的一段对苏联充满敌意的话后面紧接着写道：“你们不要去相信他的鬼话，我们需要更多地了解你们的国家，我们的教员对你们的国家简直什么也不知道，或是，他们明明知道，也不敢告诉我们，他们害怕。可是，我真为你们的成就而感动，我们需要像你们一样地生活。”
    在苏联展览会的入口处有一条大的标语：“所有的人们都会看到，苏联的计划是和平建设的计划”，所有前来参观的孩子们，进门时很少有人能耐心地停留下来读一下这条标语，但是，当他们看完了展览会之后，这条标语所说的话却深深地回响在他们那纯洁、幼小的心灵中了。
