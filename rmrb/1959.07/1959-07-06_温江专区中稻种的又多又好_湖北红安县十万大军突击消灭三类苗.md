The 5 million mu of middle rice in Wenjiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, has turned green and begun to tiller, generally developing vigorously and growing robustly.

This year, Wenjiang Prefecture reduced the area of early rice and double-cropping late rice based on local natural conditions and labor availability, and expanded the planting area of middle rice. Currently, middle rice accounts for more than 92% of the total rice area in the prefecture. Technical measures to strive for a bumper harvest of middle rice have also been grasped more deeply and comprehensively than in previous years. The entire prefecture has vigorously promoted high-yield local varieties with strong adaptability (fertilizer resistance, lodging resistance, disease and insect resistance), such as Sanbai Bang, Heiguzi, and Tiegan Nian; it has also promoted several foreign high-yield varieties, such as Nante No. 1 and Zhechang No. 3. All rice fields generally adopted methods such as set-plow deep plowing and plowing before digging, with a plowing depth of about one chi [approximately 1/3 meter]. Combined with deep plowing, methods such as smoked soil and pit soil were also widely implemented to increase soil fertility.

Before transplanting, a debate centered on dense planting was carried out from top to bottom. Generally, 300,000 to 400,000 seedlings were actually transplanted per mu, an increase of more than 70% compared to last year. Transplanting methods include "Double Dragons Going Out to Sea" (complex strip planting) and "Ants Coming Out of Their Hole" (single strip planting). These forms effectively solve the difficulties of inter-cultivation and weeding after dense planting, and can avoid the shortcomings of excessive autumn rain, humidity, and insufficient sunshine affecting growth. For middle rice basal fertilizer, more than 20,000 jin [1 jin = 0.5 kg] of coarse fertilizer and 4,000 to 5,000 jin of refined fertilizer were generally applied per mu. In the future, it was also decided to adopt the "apply evenly, apply adequately, and apply fully" method of topdressing, grasping the principles of "seedling fertilizer evenly, panicle fertilizer fully, and grain fertilizer adequately," and applying topdressing in a timely manner according to local conditions, seedling conditions, field conditions, and weather conditions, so as to prevent seedlings from growing excessively during the seedling stage, from closing rows too early, and from becoming deficient in fertilizer in the later stage.

In order to make the field management work of middle rice in the future meticulous, in-depth, and timely, the production teams of each commune in the prefecture have established professional teams, implementing contracted responsibility by area, and assigning specific plots to people.

The entire prefecture will divide field management into three stages according to the growth and development laws of middle rice: ① After transplanting and before heading, adopt the "three early" methods of early inter-cultivation, early topdressing, and early elimination of third-class seedlings to promote early tillering and more tillering of seedlings. ② From the rounding stem stage to the heading stage, apply sufficient heading fertilizer and grain fertilizer, and launch a campaign to prevent and control diseases and insect pests and prevent lodging. ③ After heading and flowering, seize the time to apply sufficient grain fertilizer and carry out "one sufficiency and four preventions" work of preventing wind, preventing lodging, preventing floods, and preventing scattering.

Xinhua News Agency: Hong'an County, Hubei, has about 26% of its middle rice and late japonica in the third-class seedling category. Currently, efforts are being strengthened in the field management of these third-class seedlings in an effort to upgrade them as soon as possible.

In Hong'an County, eliminating third-class seedlings has formed a mass movement. Cadres at all levels go deep into backward teams and backward plots to personally manage third-class seedlings. Forty-four team leaders and above cadres in the Minli Management Area of the Ercheng Commune are responsible for managing 35 mu of third-class seedlings, regularly contracting to eliminate them. Yang Xinyu, deputy secretary of the general branch stationed in the Mingxing Production Team, and technical cadre Zhang Peiyu managed four mu of third-class seedlings, applying eight dan [1 dan = 50 kg] of plant ash, twelve dan of human manure, and six jin of ammonium sulfate per mu, and continuously weeding twice and pulling out barnyard grass once. The seedlings improved within seven days. With cadres taking the lead and everyone lending a hand, the entire management area applied more than 21,000 dan of green fertilizer and collected more than 20,000 jin of pig and cattle manure in four days. All third-class seedlings have been top-dressed once or twice.

Currently, a 100,000-strong shock force is continuing to fight against third-class seedlings. 80% of the county's third-class rice seedlings have been weeded once or twice, and 70% have been fertilized. (Attached picture)

### 温江专区中稻种的又多又好  湖北红安县十万大军突击消灭三类苗

    温江专区中稻种的又多又好
    湖北红安县十万大军突击消灭三类苗
    本报讯　四川省温江专区五百万亩中稻，已经转青、开始分蘖，一般发育旺盛，生长粗壮。
    今年温江专区根据当地自然条件和劳力情况，缩小了早稻和双季晚稻面积，扩大了中稻种植面积。目前，全专区中稻占全部水稻面积的92％以上。在争取中稻大丰收的技术措施方面，也比往年抓得深入、全面。全专区大力推广了适应性强
  （耐肥、抗倒伏、抗病抗虫）的高产地方良种，如三百棒、黑谷子、铁秆粘等；也推广了几个外来高产良种，如南特号、浙场三号。所有稻田，一般都采用了套犁深耕和先犁后挖等办法，耕深一尺左右。结合深耕，还普遍推行了熏土、坑土等办法，增进了土壤肥力。
    插秧以前，自上而下地开展了以密植为中心的辩论，一般每亩实插三十万苗到四十万苗，比去年增加70％以上。插秧方式有“双龙出海”（复式条插）和“蚂蚁出洞”（单式条插）等。这些形式都有效地解决了密植后的中耕、除草困难，可以避免秋季阴雨多湿、日照不足，影响生长的缺点。中稻基肥，每亩普遍施粗肥两万斤以上；精肥四至五千斤。今后还决定采取“施匀、施足、施饱”的追肥方法，掌握“苗肥匀、穗肥饱、粒肥足”的原则，因地制宜地适时、看苗、看田、看天追肥，做到苗期不徒长，封行不过早，后期不脱肥。
    为了使今后中稻田间管理工作做得细致、深入、及时，全专区各公社的生产队，都成立了专业队伍，实行分片包干，划片定块，人田对号的专业管理。
    全专区将按中稻生长发育规律，把田间管理分为三个阶段：①插秧后、孕穗前，采取早中耕、早追肥、早消灭三类苗的“三早”办法，促使秧苗早分蘖、多分蘖。②圆秆到孕穗期间，饱施攻穗肥、攻粒肥，并开展突击防治病虫灾害和防倒伏运动。③抽穗、扬花以后，抓紧进行饱施粒肥和防风、防倒、防洪、防抛撒等“一饱四防”工作。

    本报讯　湖北红安县中稻和晚粳的三类苗约占总面积的26％，目前正在加强这些三类苗的田间管理，争取三类苗尽快升级。
    红安县消灭三类苗已经形成群众性运动。各级干部深入落后队、落后冲亲自管理三类苗。二程公社民利管理区四十四个小队长以上干部，负责管理三十五亩三类苗，定期包干消灭。驻明星生产队的总支副书记杨新玉和技术干部张培玉，管理的四亩三类苗，每亩追了八担草木灰、十二担人粪尿和六斤硫酸铵，连续薅了两次草、扯了一次稗，在七天内秧苗就有了好转。在干部带头、人人动手的情况下，全管理区四天就打青肥二万一千多担，捡猪牛屎二万多斤。所有三类苗都追了一至两次肥。
    目前，十万突击大军正继续奋战三类苗，全县水稻三类苗有80％的锄了一至两次草，70％的追了肥。（附图片）
