    A New Trend in Fame and Fortune
    The British "Daily Herald" reported on June 25th: A trend of buying paintings at high prices is prevalent in Britain, and many Americans are buying paintings at high prices. A British rich man also imitated this, spending 275,000 pounds to buy a famous painting "The Adoration of the Magi" by the 17th-century Dutch master Rubens.
    Why do Americans love paintings so much? The "Daily Herald" reporter tells us:
    "American businessmen are also vying to buy paintings to avoid paying taxes, because Americans can reduce their taxes by donating the paintings they buy to the country."
    "American millionaires buy paintings to donate to the country after their death, hoping that art museums will be named after them, thereby passing on their fame to future generations."
    It turns out that this trend is still a trend of vying for fame and fortune, but it has shifted to famous paintings. This can really be called "the more things change, the more they stay the same." (Liu Qi)

    名利新风
    英国“每日先驱报”6月25日报道说：目前英国以高价买画的风气盛行，不少美国人用高价买画。一个英国富人也来东施效颦，用二十七万五千英镑的高价购买了十七世纪荷兰大画家鲁宾斯的一幅名画“三贤拜耶稣”。
    美国人为什么这样爱画呢？“每日先驱报”的记者告诉我们：
    “美国商人为避免交税，也争相买画，因为美国人买到画捐献给国家就可以减税了”。
    “美国富翁买画是为了在死后捐献给国家，希望艺术博物馆以他的名字命名，从而传名后世。”
    原来，这风气仍还是争名夺利的风气，只不过是转移到名画上来了。这真可叫万变不离其宗。（刘起）
