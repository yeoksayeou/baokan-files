Husband and Wife, Double “Top Scholars”

On the evening of July 11th, the Wubaili Production Team of the Hongtang Brigade of the Hongtang Commune in Yichun County, Jiangxi, held a meeting of all its members. Team leader Zeng Xirong conveyed the conditions set by the brigade for "competing to be 'Double-Harvesting Top Scholars.'" The next morning, Zeng Caifang and Liu Xiuying, a married couple, went to the team leader’s house and requested that they be allowed to work together for a few days. The team leader had already anticipated that they would want to compete to be "top scholars," so he readily agreed.

That day, the couple was assigned to transplant rice seedlings. According to the brigade's regulations, a man had to transplant 1.5 mu (with seedlings spaced 5x8 inches) of rice paddies during the day to be considered a "top scholar," and a woman had to transplant 0.8 mu. Completing this task was by no means easy.

Zeng Caifang was responsible for transplanting, and Liu Xiuying for pulling seedlings. The two of them didn't even want to stretch their backs and worked harder. At the end of the noon work period, Xiuying asked Caifang how many rice seedlings he had transplanted. Caifang said, "I've transplanted 1.1 mu. If we both want to be top scholars, we're still short 1.2 mu."

Hearing that he hadn't completed even half the task, Xiuying smiled at Caifang. Caifang said somewhat unconvinced, "What about you?" "Me? I've already pulled 600 bundles of seedlings, enough to transplant 2.3 mu."

"Ah, people say your skills are good, and I only believe it today! Last year, you weren't very good at pulling seedlings, but this year you've improved so quickly..." In the afternoon, Xiuying loaded the seedlings and delivered them to the rice paddies, then started transplanting rice seedlings herself. The two of them transplanted side by side, row by row, neither willing to admit defeat. In the evening, team leader Zeng Xirong came to the fields to inspect, and they had already transplanted 2.5 mu of rice paddies, with seedlings spaced 5x8 inches, each clump having more than twelve roots, planted deeply, firmly, and straight, fully meeting the standards. They were awarded the title of "Husband and Wife Double-Harvesting Top Scholars."

The next day, their enthusiasm was even greater, and they registered with the team leader to compete to be reaping and threshing top scholars. According to the brigade's regulations, a man had to reap and thresh four dan (each dan weighing 140 jin) of grain per day, and a woman had to complete 2.5 dan to be a top scholar. As a result, the couple completed 12 dan in one day, including both reaping and threshing.

The brigade Party branch secretary personally went to the Wubaili team and presented them with the "Husband and Wife Double-Harvesting Top Scholar" certificate at a mass meeting. Under their influence, a high-efficiency movement of everyone competing to be a top scholar was launched throughout the village.

    夫妻双“状元”
    7月11日晚上，江西宜春县洪塘公社洪塘大队五百里生产小队召开了全体队员会，小队长曾喜荣传达了大队规定的“考‘双抢状元’”的条件。第二天清晨，曾才方与刘秀英夫妇就跑到小队长家里要求让他们夫妇两人合在一起干几天。小队长早已预料到他俩要考“状元”，就满口答应了。
    这天他们夫妇两人分的是栽禾工。按大队的规定，男人白天要栽一亩五分田（5×8寸的禾）才算中了状元；女人要栽八分田。要完成这个任务，决不是一件容易的事情。
    曾才方管栽插，刘秀英扯秧。俩人连腰也不愿伸一伸，加劲地干。中午收工的时候，秀英问才方栽了多少禾。才方说：“栽完了一亩一分田。俩人要中状元，还少一亩二分田。”
    秀英听说还未完成一半任务，望着才方笑了笑。才方有点不服气地说：“你呢？”“我？已扯了六百把秧，够栽二亩三分田了。”
      “唉，别人说你的技术好，我今天才相信！去年你都不大会扯秧，今年就变得这样快。……”下午秀英把秧装好，送到栽禾田里以后，接着也栽起禾来。两人你一行，我一行地并排栽过去，谁都不服输。傍晚，小队长曾喜荣来田边验收，他俩已栽完了二亩五分田，株行距5×8寸，每蔸均在十二根以上，栽的深、稳、正，完全合乎标准。他俩考中了“夫妇双抢状元”。
    第三天，他们的干劲更足了，又向队长报了考刈禾打禾状元。按大队规定男人一天包刈包打四担谷（每担一百四十斤计算），女人完成二担半就能中状元。结果他们夫妇俩人连刈带打一天完成了十二担。
    大队党支部书记亲自到五百里小队，在群众大会上发给他俩“夫妇双抢状元”的奖状。在他俩的影响下，全村掀起了一个人人考状元的高工效运动。
