Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 17th. A spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry recently issued a statement refuting the views put forward by the British Foreign Office in two letters to the Soviet Foreign Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of the People's Republic of China in June regarding the situation in Laos.

The statement said that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd said that the Lao government had not violated the Geneva Accords on Laos and the agreements signed between the Lao Kingdom government and the former Pathet Lao fighting forces. He also believed that the resumption of the activities of the International Commission for Laos should not be agreed to against the wishes of the Lao government. The statement said: "This view is inconsistent with the facts that have occurred in Laos, and it is also inconsistent with the urgent desire to implement the Geneva Accords on Laos."

The statement cited a large number of facts to strongly demonstrate that the Lao Kingdom government has seriously violated the Geneva Accords on the Laos issue and the agreements signed between the Lao Kingdom government and the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, thereby threatening peace in Laos and Indochina.

The statement said: "After the restoration of peace in Indochina, US imperialism immediately exhausted all means to undermine the Geneva Accords on Laos, interfered in Laos, and attempted to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc, turning Laos into a US military base to prepare for provoking a new war."

The statement said that since the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos suspended its activities, and since the Phoui Sananikone government came to power, US imperialism's interference in Laos, especially military interference, has been further strengthened.

The statement said: "In order to realize US imperialism's conspiracy in Indochina, the Lao Kingdom government colluded with the South Vietnamese regime and the Chiang Kai-shek remnants, condoning the South Vietnamese authorities' dispatch of spies into Lao territory to harass and sabotage the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and condoning the Chiang Kai-shek remnants' use of Lao territory to harass the People's Republic of China. The Tai puppet troops of Diao Wenlong, who formerly belonged to part of the French expeditionary force, are now operating in Lao territory near the Vietnam-Laos border. These puppet troops have repeatedly harassed and invaded the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam." The planes and troops of the Phoui Sananikone government have also repeatedly violated the airspace and territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, creating the Xiang Li incident and creating tension on the Vietnam-Laos border.

The statement said that the Phoui Sananikone government has completely abandoned its policy of peace and neutrality and has turned Laos into a tool for US imperialism's policy of war preparation. They are carrying out cruel suppression and persecution of patriotic and peace-loving progressive forces in Laos. The statement said, concerning the recent situation in Laos: "On May 11, 1959, the Phoui Sananikone government further conspired to provoke civil war in Laos and undermine peace and security in Indochina." They attempted to disarm and eliminate two battalions of the former Pathet Lao fighting forces by force, and then launch a comprehensive offensive against the patriotic and progressive forces in Laos, in order to establish a dictatorial system in Laos, preparing to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc. At the same time, in Vientiane, the leaders of the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, including Prince Souphanouvong, were closely controlled by the Kingdom government's army and police, and cadres of the former Pathet Lao fighting forces in various places were subjected to blatant suppression.

The statement said: "The Sananikone government is also colluding more and more closely with the South Vietnamese authorities and the Thai authorities, preparing to realize a trilateral military alliance, in order to realize the plan to drag South Vietnam and Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc."

The statement said: "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the resumption of the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos is very necessary. Doing so will not only not infringe upon Laos' sovereignty, but on the contrary, it can guarantee the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords on Laos."

The statement said: "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the governments of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, as the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina, must take urgent measures to resume the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, in order to investigate activities that violate the Geneva Accords on Laos, and ensure that the Geneva Accords on Laos and all agreements signed between the Lao Kingdom government and the former Pathet Lao fighting forces are fully implemented, thereby guaranteeing the unity and national harmony of the Lao people, and guaranteeing peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia."

    越南外交部斥英国歪曲老挝局势真象
    老挝政府威胁印度支那和平
    新华社河内17日电　越南外交部发言人最近发表声明，驳斥了英国外交部在6月间给苏联外交部和中华人民共和国外交部的两封信中对老挝局势所提出的看法。
    声明说，英国外交大臣劳埃德说，老挝政府没有违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议，他同时认为不能违背老挝政府的愿望来同意恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。声明说：“这种看法是同在老挝发生的事实不相符合的，同时也是同迫切要求履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议的愿望不相符合的。”
    声明举述了大量事实有力地说明了老挝王国政府已经严重违反了关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议，从而威胁到老挝和印度支那的和平。
    声明说：“在印度支那恢复和平之后，美帝国主义立刻用尽一切手段来破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议，对老挝进行干涉，企图把老挝拉进东南亚军事侵略集团，把老挝变成美国的军事基地，以准备挑起新的战争。”
    声明说，自从老挝国际监察和监督委员会暂停活动，和自从培·萨纳尼空政府执政之后，美帝国主义对老挝的干涉、尤其是军事方面的干涉又有进一步的加强。
    声明说：“为了实现美帝国主义在印度支那的阴谋，老挝王国政府同南越政权和蒋介石残匪互相勾结，纵容南越当局派遣间谍到老挝境内对越南民主共和国进行骚扰和破坏活动，纵容蒋介石残匪利用老挝领土来对中华人民共和国进行骚扰活动。过去属于法国远征军一部分的刁文龙的傣族伪军，现在正在靠近越南—老挝边界的老挝境内进行活动，这些伪军曾经多次骚扰和侵犯越南民主共和国的领土。”培·萨纳尼空政府的飞机和军队还曾经多次侵犯越南民主共和国的领空和领土，制造向立事件，制造越南—老挝边界的紧张气氛。
    声明说，培·萨纳尼空政府已经完全废弃了和平中立政策，把老挝变成美帝国主义准备战争政策的工具。他们对老挝爱国和爱和平的进步力量进行残酷的镇压和迫害。声明谈到老挝最近的局势时说：“1959年5月11日，培·萨纳尼空政府进一步阴谋挑起老挝的内战，破坏印度支那的和平和安全。”他们企图用武力解除前寮国战斗部队两个营的武装和消灭他们，然后向老挝爱国和进步力量展开全面的进攻，以期在老挝建立独裁制度，准备把老挝拉入东南亚军事侵略集团。与此同时，在万象，前寮国战斗部队的领袖，其中有苏发努冯亲王，被王国政府的军队和警察严密管制，在各地的前寮国战斗部队的干部受到明目张胆的镇压。
    声明说：“萨纳尼空政府还越来越紧密地同南越当局和泰国当局勾结，准备实现三边军事联盟，以实现把南越和老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团的计划。”
    声明说：“越南民主共和国政府认为，老挝国际监察和监督委员会的恢复活动是非常必要的，这样做不但不会侵犯老挝的主权，相反地可以保证老挝日内瓦协议获得严正的履行。”
    声明说：“越南民主共和国政府认为作为1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两主席国的苏联和英国政府，必须采取紧急措施，恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动，以便调查违反老挝日内瓦协议的活动，保证老挝日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的一切协议得到充分的履行，从而保证老挝人民的统一和民族和睦，保证印度支那和东南亚的和平。”
