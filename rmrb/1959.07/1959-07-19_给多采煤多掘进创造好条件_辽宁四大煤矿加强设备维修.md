Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 18th: Liaoning's four major coal mines, Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao, are carrying out a mass equipment overhaul movement to ensure a double harvest in coal mining and tunneling. Since the beginning of July, the mines have already overhauled more than 640 pieces of electrical, transportation, coal mining, tunneling, and stripping equipment.

During the overhaul, the mines first focused on key equipment that directly affects coal mining, tunneling, and stripping, such as mine carts, small equipment for mines, electric locomotives, electric picks, and dump trucks for open-pit mines. Fushun Victory Mine's machine repair workers collaborated with electrical repair workers to repair ten discarded 3.5-horsepower electric motors for coal chutes. Longfeng Mine's maintenance personnel replaced cotters, sleepers, and wheels on coal carts every day, with an average of more than 40 coal carts receiving maintenance and upkeep daily.

The maintenance workers at the mines also came up with various methods to overcome the shortage of materials in the maintenance work. Employees of the East Machine Repair Plant of Fuxin Haizhou Mine developed an automatic wire drawing machine, drawing thick copper wires into thin copper wires, which were used to repair more than 40 electric motors. The ironworking team workers at this plant used scrap steel rails as materials to process a batch of twist drills, supporting the urgent needs of coal mining and tunneling.

While vigorously carrying out the major equipment overhaul, many mines also boldly mobilized the masses to rectify and improve various equipment maintenance systems to ensure that all equipment can operate normally.

    给多采煤多掘进创造好条件
    辽宁四大煤矿加强设备维修
    新华社沈阳18日电　辽宁抚顺、阜新、本溪、北票四大煤矿开展群众性的设备大检修运动，保证采煤掘进双丰收。进入7月以来，各矿已经检修好机电、运输、采煤、掘进和剥离等设备六百四十多台。
    各矿在检修中首先抓住了直接影响采煤、掘进和剥离的关键设备，如矿井用的煤车、小型设备，露天矿用的电机车、电镐和自翻车等。抚顺胜利矿机修工人同电修工人协作，把十台已经废弃的三点五马力煤溜子电机修理好了。龙凤矿检修人员每天给生产的煤车换稍子、台木、车轮等，平均每天有四十多台煤车得到保养维护。
    各矿检修工人还想出各种办法，克服维修工作中材料不足的困难。阜新海州矿东机修厂职工研究出自动拔丝机，把粗铜线拔成细铜线，用来检修好四十多台电动机。这个厂的铁工组工人利用废钢轨作材料，加工了一批麻花钎子，支援了采煤和掘进的急需。
    在大力进行设备大检修的同时，许多矿还放手发动群众，整顿和健全了各项设备的保养维护制度，以确保所有设备都能正常运转。
