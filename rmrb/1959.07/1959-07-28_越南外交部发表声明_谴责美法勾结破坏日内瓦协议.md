Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 27th: Newspapers here today published a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on July 26 regarding the joint communique recently signed by Laos and France concerning the use of US-funded weapons in Laos and the deployment of US military experts to strengthen the military forces of the Kingdom of Laos.

The statement said that, in addition to the aforementioned joint communique between France and Laos, reliable sources reveal that the United States and France also signed an agreement in June regarding the training of Lao troops. The statement pointed out, "The above-mentioned actions by US imperialism, the Sananikone government, and the French government are new steps in realizing the overall plan of US imperialism to further interfere in Laos, transform Laos into a US military base, draw Laos into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, expand the civil war in Laos, and prepare to provoke a new war in Indochina and Southeast Asia." The statement said, "Such actions blatantly violate the Geneva Accords on Laos."

The statement said, "In order to legitimize the action of expanding the military strength of the Kingdom of Laos and to further seize command of the army of the Kingdom of Laos, US imperialism forced France to sign the US-French agreement, and also forced France to reach the current agreement with the Sananikone government, in order to illegally transport new US weapons and military personnel into Laos."

The statement pointed out that the joint communique signed by Laos and France stipulates that the plan to strengthen the Lao army should be realized within six months to a year, and that this work should be regarded as an urgent task. This situation further shows that US imperialism is stepping up the implementation of its challenging plan in Laos.

The statement then condemned the actions of US imperialism and the Lao authorities in undermining the Geneva Accords. The statement said that since the International Commission for Laos temporarily ceased its activities, especially since Prime Minister Sananikone took office, US imperialism has intensified its interference in Laos, particularly in military affairs.

The statement also condemned the Sananikone government's increasingly close collusion with the South Vietnamese authorities.

The statement said that the so-called "cooperation" agreements recently signed by the Kingdom of Laos government with the South Vietnamese authorities and the Thai government include many military clauses.

The statement said that the Sananikone government has also openly announced the tearing up of the Geneva Accords on Laos, further suppressing personnel of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and the patriotic and peace-loving Lao people, encircling and attempting to eliminate the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and launching a civil war in Laos.

The statement pointed out, "The above-mentioned actions of US imperialism and its lackeys – the Lao reactionaries – grossly violate the military and political clauses of the Geneva Accords on Laos."

The statement said that under the direction of US imperialism, the Phoui Sananikone government has recently expanded anti-communist propaganda in an attempt to realize its conspiracy to eliminate the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and further suppress the patriotic and peace-loving Lao people.

The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam solemnly condemns the above-mentioned conspiracy of US imperialism and its lackey, the Sananikone government, and condemns the French government's actions in following US imperialism and colluding with the United States.

The statement said that the war preparations of US imperialism and the Lao authorities have made the situation in Laos increasingly tense, and peace in the Indochina region is facing a serious threat. US imperialism and the Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for the consequences of their actions.

The statement said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam demands that the Kingdom of Laos government thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords on Laos, urge the United States to withdraw US advisors and US military personnel from Laos, and not accept US weapons.

The statement said that the governments of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, as the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, the governments of all member states of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, and the governments of all countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina must take urgent measures to restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos in order to prevent a new war from breaking out again in the Indochina region.

    越南外交部发表声明
    谴责美法勾结破坏日内瓦协议
    据新华社河内27日电　此间报纸今天刊载了越南民主共和国外交部7月26日就老挝同法国最近签署的关于使用美国援助老挝的武器和美国军事专家来加强老挝王国的军事力量的联合公报发表的声明。
    声明说，除了法国同老挝的上述联合公报以外，据可靠消息透露，美国和法国在6月间还签定了关于训练老挝军队的协定。声明指出，
  “美帝国主义、萨纳尼空政府和法国政府的上述行动是实现美帝国主义企图进一步干涉老挝、把老挝变成美国的军事基地和把老挝拉入东南亚条约组织，扩大老挝内战、准备在印度支那和东南亚地区挑起新战争的全盘计划的新的步骤。”声明说，“这种行动明目张胆地违反了关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。”
    声明说，“美帝国主义为了使扩充老挝王国军事力量的行动合法化和进一步掌握对老挝王国军队的指挥权，迫使法国签订了美法协定，并且迫使法国同萨纳尼空政府达成目前的这项协议，以便把美国的新式武器和军事人员非法运进老挝。”
    声明指出，老挝和法国签署的联合公报规定在半年到一年的时间内实现加强老挝军队的计划，并且把这个工作当作一项紧急任务。这种情况进一步表明，美帝国主义正在老挝加紧实现它的挑战计划。
    声明接着谴责了美帝国主义和老挝当局破坏日内瓦协议的行动。声明说，自从老挝国际委员会暂时停止活动以来，特别是萨纳尼空首相执政以来，美帝国主义加强了对老挝的干涉，特别是军事方面的干涉。
    声明还谴责萨纳尼空政府日益紧密地同南越当局进行勾结。
    声明说，老挝王国政府最近同南越当局和泰国政府签订的所谓“合作”协定包括了许多军事条款。
    声明说，萨纳尼空政府还公然宣布撕毁关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，进一步镇压前寮国战斗部队人员以及爱国和爱好和平的老挝人民，包围和企图消灭前寮国战斗部队，发动了老挝的内战。
    声明指出，“美帝国主义和它的走狗——老挝反动派的上述行动粗暴地违反了关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的军事和政治条款。”
    声明说，在美帝国主义的指使下，培·萨纳尼空政府最近扩大反共宣传，企图实现消灭前寮国战斗部队和进一步镇压爱国和爱好和平的老挝人民的阴谋。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府严正谴责美帝国主义和它的走狗萨纳尼空政府的上述阴谋，并且谴责法国政府追随美帝国主义和同美国勾结的行动。
    声明说，美帝国主义和老挝当局的备战活动使老挝局势日益紧张，印度支那地区的和平正在受到严重的威胁。美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府必须对它们的行动所造成的后果负完全责任。
    声明说，越南民主共和国要求老挝王国政府彻底履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，促使美国撤退在老挝的美国顾问和美国军事人员，并且不得接受美国的武器。
    声明说，作为日内瓦会议的两位主席的苏联政府和英国政府、老挝国际监察和监督委员会各成员国政府和参加1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的各国政府必须采取紧急措施，使老挝国际监察和监督委员会恢复活动，以阻止新的战争在印度支那地区重新爆发。
