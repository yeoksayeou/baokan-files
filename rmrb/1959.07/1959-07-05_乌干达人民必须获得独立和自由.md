The people of Uganda must obtain independence and freedom
By a commentator of this newspaper

    Not long ago, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council announced July 5, 1959 as "Support Uganda People's Day." The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee enthusiastically responded to this call and issued a statement expressing the Chinese people's deep sympathy and support for the Ugandan people who are fighting for the independence and freedom of their motherland.

    Uganda in East Africa once established a strong independent state in history. It has hardworking and intelligent people, rich mineral deposits, fertile land, and boundless virgin forests. However, for more than half a century, the iron heels of British colonialists have barbarously ravaged Uganda's beautiful and rich land, bringing endless disasters to the more than five million Ugandan people. The people of Uganda have never ceased resisting British colonial rule. They yearn for freedom and demand to control their own destiny. People clearly remember that more than two years ago, when the current British Governor Crawford was sworn into office, more than ten thousand Ugandan Africans held marches and demonstrations, shouting "We have had enough of British rule" and demanding independence and freedom. And now, with the continuous upsurge of the national independence movement in the entire African colony, the Ugandan people's call for independence has become even louder.

    Since the beginning of this year, influenced by the anti-colonialist struggles of the people in Congo, Nyasaland and other African colonies, the Ugandan people have launched a new struggle against British colonial rule. They held rallies and demonstrations, and carried out trade boycotts to protest the colonial authorities' repressive measures. Recently, there have also been women's demonstrations demanding the release of six national movement leaders arrested by the British colonial authorities. All this proves that not only in British Central Africa, but also in British East Africa, the foundation of colonial rule has been shaken.

    The British colonialists have adopted brutal means of suppression against the Ugandan people's struggle for national independence. The colonial authorities illegally banned the two patriotic parties, the "Uganda National Movement" and the "Uganda Freedom Movement," arrested and exiled leaders of the national movement, and prohibited Africans from holding gatherings. Recently, the colonial authorities even declared a "state of emergency" in Uganda and designated Buganda Province as a so-called "riot area." On June 5, a bloody incident occurred in Katwe where the colonial authorities' police fired at demonstrating crowds. The British colonialists vainly attempt to use barbaric suppression to scare off the Ugandan people and contain the national independence movements in Central and East Africa. But facts have proved that this is of no use. It can be asserted that the British colonialists' brutal acts can only further arouse greater resistance from the Ugandan people and a new upsurge in the anti-colonialist struggles of the people of Central Africa and East Africa. Today, no force in the world can stop the Ugandan people and the people of African colonies from moving towards independence and freedom.

    乌干达人民必须获得独立和自由
    本报评论员
    不久以前，亚非人民团结理事会宣布了1959年7月5日为“支援乌干达人民日”，中国亚非团结委员会热烈地响应这个号召，并发表声明表达了中国人民对于正在为自己祖国的独立和自由而斗争的乌干达人民的深切同情和支持。
    东非洲的乌干达曾经在历史上建立过强盛的独立国家，那里有勤劳智慧的人民、丰富的矿藏、肥沃的土地和一望无际的原始森林。但是，半个多世纪以来，英国殖民者的铁蹄野蛮地蹂躏了乌干达这美丽富饶的国土，为五百多万乌干达人民带来了无穷无尽的灾难。乌干达人民从未停止过对英国殖民统治的反抗，他们向往自由，要求掌握自己的命运。人们清楚地记得，两年多以前，当现任的英国总督克劳福德宣誓就职的时候，一万多个乌干达非洲人举行游行示威，高呼“我们受够了英国的统治”，要求独立和自由。而现在，随着整个非洲殖民地民族独立运动的不断高涨，乌干达人民要求独立的呼声也更加响亮起来了。
    今年以来，在刚果、尼亚萨兰和其他非洲殖民地人民反殖民主义斗争的浪潮影响之下，乌干达人民展开了反对英国殖民统治的新的斗争。他们举行集会游行、进行贸易抵制，抗议殖民当局的镇压措施。最近还发生了妇女示威运动，要求释放被英国殖民当局逮捕的六名民族运动的领袖。这一切都证明了不仅是在英属中非，而且在英属东非，殖民主义的统治基础也已发生了动摇。
    英国殖民者对于乌干达人民争取民族独立的斗争采取了残暴的镇压手段。殖民当局非法地取缔了“乌干达民族运动”和“乌干达自由运动”这两个爱国政党，逮捕和流放民族运动的领袖，禁止非洲人举行集会。最近，殖民当局竟在乌干达宣布“紧急状态”，并把布干达省划为所谓“骚乱区”。6月5日在卡特威地方还发生了殖民当局的警察开枪射击示威群众的血腥事件。英国殖民者妄想用野蛮的镇压来吓退乌干达人民和遏止中非和东非的民族独立运动。但事实表明，这是没有什么用处的。可以断言，英国殖民者的残暴行为只能进一步激起乌干达人民更大的反抗和中非、东非各国人民反殖民主义斗争的新的高涨。今天，世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡乌干达人民和非洲殖民地人民走向独立和自由的道路。
