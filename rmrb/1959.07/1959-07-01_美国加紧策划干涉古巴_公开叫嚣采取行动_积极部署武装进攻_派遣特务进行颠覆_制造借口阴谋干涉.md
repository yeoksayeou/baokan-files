Xinhua News Agency, 30th Dispatch: Recently, the U.S. imperialists' clamor for intervention in Cuba has become increasingly rampant. They have declared that if the Cuban government does not abandon land reform, they will resort to armed intervention. Many facts prove that this clamor by interventionists is a dangerous signal, and the despicable scheme to interfere in Cuba and deny the Cuban people the independent right to handle their own affairs is being stepped up in Washington.

According to a report in the "Canadian Forum" on June 29th, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Mr. Belton delivered a speech to the Pan-American Business Owners Council in Chicago on June 12th, saying: Action must be taken against Cuba, otherwise a "communist country" will appear at "our (U.S.) doorstep." He emphasized that the only way is to use force. He also expressed the hope for an armed rebellion in Cuba to drive out Castro with another "revolution."

Mr. Belton's remarks followed an official U.S. action. On June 11th, the day before Mr. Belton made these remarks, the U.S. government submitted a note to the Cuban government, expressing "serious concern" about the Cuban government's implementation of land reform and expressing "regret" that the Cuban government had not listened to the "opinions of American investors" on the issue of land reform.

The "New York Times" once directly proposed in an editorial that Cuba's land reform law needed to be revised.

The U.S. imperialists have become so rampant in interfering in Cuba's internal affairs because Cuba's land reform has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. monopoly capital that has been sucking the blood of the Cuban people since the last century.

All indications show that the U.S. imperialists are accelerating the movement to interfere in Cuba in the following three aspects:

First, they are gathering the exiled Batista elements and trying to rely on the crumbling Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic, using the Dominican Republic as a springboard to launch armed attacks on Cuba from the outside. Not long ago, there were reports that the main force of counter-revolutionary forces had been deployed near the Cuban coast, and Trujillo had mobilized his planes and warships and was standing by to depart. Batista elements are, under the protection of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, shipping large quantities of arms from Miami in the United States to meet the needs of counter-revolutionary military operations.

To prepare for counter-revolutionary provocations, the United States has increased its troop presence at the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba by 30,000. In addition, U.S. warships frequently appear in Cuban waters. The commander-in-chief of the U.S. Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba also led a fleet to the Dominican Republic for a "visit" on the 25th.

Second, the United States has sent a large number of special agents to sneak into Cuba, recruit counter-revolutionaries, and organize subversion activities within Cuba. According to the Cuban "Hoy" newspaper: U.S. special agent chief Allen Dulles once discussed with Eisenhower a plan to carry out subversion activities in Cuba. The news said that Colonel Knight, a U.S. agent known for his assassination activities in Latin America, has sent more than 300 special agents to Cuba to engage in conspiracy activities, and Knight himself is the chief person in charge of the special agents sent to Cuba by the United States.

There are constant reports revealing that U.S. planes have repeatedly intruded into Cuban airspace to airdrop weapons and distribute counter-revolutionary leaflets to counter-revolutionaries.

Third, the United States is attempting to use the "Organization of American States" as a counter-revolutionary gendarmerie to interfere in Cuba. As early as April, U.S. ambassadors to various Caribbean countries discussed this approach at a meeting held in El Salvador. In order to find an excuse for interfering in Cuba, some U.S. politicians and reactionary newspapers have been promoting the "communist threat" of Cuba and repeatedly fabricating rumors that Cuba is "invading" neighboring countries. Under the direction of the United States, pro-American regimes in countries such as the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua have successively fabricated so-called "invasion" threats from Cuba, demanding that the United States and the "Organization of American States" "take measures." The Cuban People's Socialist Party once revealed that the United States had single-handedly created a conspiracy in which special agents were dispatched from Cuba to gather a group of armed personnel to enter Nicaragua.

Following the failure of the "invasion" of Nicaragua conspiracy, the United States fabricated the conspiracy of the so-called "Cuban expeditionary force invading" Panama. U.S. Senator Smathers even proposed a suggestion in the Senate to establish an "Organization of American States" "police force" when the U.S. propaganda machine was massively "previewing" the "invasion" of Panama by Cuban personnel. Subsequently, the U.S. Senate decided to allocate nearly 30 million U.S. dollars to establish this "police force" proposed by Smathers. Needless to say, the establishment of such an aggressive gendarmerie is primarily aimed at suppressing the Cuban people.

The Cuban people have been mobilized and are determined to crush U.S. aggression and subversion activities. Many Cuban government leaders have repeatedly stated that Cuba will safeguard its independent sovereignty. Premier Castro has stated more than once that Cuba will implement the land reform law. He warned: "The Cuban people's determination to realize the revolution is as strong as steel, and the enemy will be smashed."

    美国加紧策划干涉古巴
    公开叫嚣采取行动  积极部署武装进攻
    派遣特务进行颠覆　制造借口阴谋干涉
    据新华社30日讯　最近，美帝国主义者干涉古巴的叫嚣越来越嚣张。他们扬言，如果古巴政府不放弃土地改革，就要诉诸武力干涉。有许多事实证明，干涉主义者的这种叫嚣是一个危险的信号，干涉古巴、不让古巴人民有处理自己事务的独立权利的卑鄙勾当正在华盛顿加紧推行中。
    据“加拿大论坛报”6月29日报道，美国前任助理国务卿布莱敦6月12日在芝加哥对泛美企业主理事会发表演讲说：必须对古巴采取行动，否则将会有一个“共产党国家”出现在“我们（美国）的门口”。他强调说，唯一的办法是行使武力。他还表示希望在古巴来一次武装叛乱，用另一次“革命”把卡斯特罗赶走。
    布莱敦的这一番话是紧接着美国的一个官方行动之后说的。在布莱敦说这番话前一天，6月11日，美国政府向古巴政府提出了一个照会，对于古巴政府实行土地改革表示“严重的关注”，并且对古巴政府没有在土地改革问题上听取“美国投资者的意见”表示“遗憾”。
      “纽约时报”曾经在一篇社论里直截了当地提出，需要修改古巴的土地改革法。
    美帝国主义者在干涉古巴内政上变得如此猖狂，是因为古巴的土地改革给了自从上一个世纪以来吸吮着古巴人民血脂的美国垄断资本以沉重的打击。
    种种迹象表明，美帝国主义者正在从以下三个方面加速推进干涉古巴的运动：
    第一，纠集流亡的巴蒂斯塔分子，并图倚靠摇摇欲坠的多米尼加特鲁希略独裁政权，以多米尼加为跳板，从外面来武装进攻古巴。不久前有消息说，反革命势力的主力已经布置在古巴海岸附近，特鲁希略已调集他的飞机和兵舰，并且待命出发。巴蒂斯塔分子正在美国联邦调查局保护下，从美国的迈阿密运出大批军火，以供反革命军事行动的需要。
    为了准备反革命挑衅，美国已经把它驻在古巴关塔那摩海军基地的军队增加了三万人。此外，美国军舰经常在古巴海面出没。美国在古巴的关塔那摩海军基地总司令在25日还率领舰队到多米尼加进行“访问”。
    第二，美国派遣了大批特务潜入古巴，收罗反革命分子，在古巴内部组织颠覆活动。据古巴“今日报”报道：美国特务头子艾伦·杜勒斯曾经和艾森豪威尔商谈了一项在古巴进行颠覆活动的计划。消息说，以特务暗杀活动在拉丁美洲出名的美国奈特上校已派了三百多名特务到古巴从事阴谋活动，奈特本人就是美国派遣到古巴的特务人员的总负责人。
    不断有消息揭露，美国飞机一再侵入古巴上空给反革命分子空投武器，并且散发反革命传单。
    第三，美国企图把“美洲国家组织”当作反革命的宪兵，来对古巴进行干涉。早在4月间，美国驻加勒比海地区各国大使在萨尔瓦多举行的一次会议上就讨论过这种做法。为了替干涉古巴找借口，美国的一些政界人士和反动报纸一直在宣传古巴的“共产主义威胁”，并一再捏造古巴“侵略”邻国的谣言。在美国指使下，多米尼加和尼加拉瓜等国的亲美政权都相继无中生有地叫嚣所谓来自古巴的“入侵”威胁，要求美国和“美洲国家组织”“采取措施”。古巴人民社会党曾经揭露，美国曾一手制造了派遣特务从古巴纠合一批武装人员进入尼加拉瓜的阴谋事件。
    继“入侵”尼加拉瓜阴谋失败之后，美国又制造了所谓“古巴远征队入侵”巴拿马事件的阴谋。美国参议员斯马瑟斯还在美国宣传机器大量“预告”将有古巴人员“入侵”巴拿马的时候，就在参议院提出建立一支“美洲国家组织”“警察部队”的建议。接着，美国参议院就决定拨出近三千万美元的款子，来建立斯马瑟斯所提出的这支“警察部队”。不用说，建立这样一支侵略宪兵队，首先是为了镇压古巴人民。
    古巴人民已经动员起来，决心粉碎美国的侵略和颠覆活动。古巴政府不少领导人一再声言，古巴将维护它的独立主权。卡斯特罗总理不止一次地表示古巴将贯彻执行土地改革法。他警告说：“古巴人民实现革命的决心像钢铁一般坚强，敌人是要碰得头破血流的。”
