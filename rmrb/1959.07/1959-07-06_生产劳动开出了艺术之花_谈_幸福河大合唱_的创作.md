    Productive Labor Blossoms into Art
    —On the Creation of the "Happiness River Chorus"
    Meng Bo

    The "Happiness River Chorus," created by four students from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Xiao Bai, Wang Jiufang, Wang Qiang, and Zhang Yingming, was initially welcomed by the masses at the Hehua Chemical Works construction site, communes, and factories. After its performance in Shanghai, it also received acclaim from the music community and audiences. Recently, it won the first prize for large choral works at the music competition of the 7th World Youth and Student Festival. The chairman of the judging committee, Max, a prominent contemporary Austrian composer, stated when announcing the decision to award the first prize to the "Happiness River Chorus" that this work, in terms of originality and popularity, was one of the most important pieces in the competition. The judging committee decided to award it the first prize without debate.

    The success of this work is mainly due to the authors' use of vivid musical imagery to portray the great determination of the people of northern Jiangsu, under the leadership of the Party, to overcome natural disasters by creating a river network to achieve a happy life for generations to come, as well as their soaring spirit in labor. Such a moving theme is essentially a microcosm of the great spiritual outlook of the six hundred million Chinese people, full of vigor and high morale during the Great Leap Forward.

    The "Overture" of the music fully expresses the magnificent spirit of declaring war on nature. The second section, "Support the Front," depicts the enthusiastic scene of the people's commune mobilizing endless manpower and material resources to support the river network project. The third section, "Pushing Wheelbarrows," uses humorous but confident musical language to express the unparalleled wisdom of the working people in technological innovation. The fourth section, "Work Song," is a close-up of the construction site, with the melody of labor and the powerful rhythm reflecting the people's soaring drive. The fifth section, "Colorful Clouds," is a lyrical movement, where the authors use romantic techniques to wholeheartedly praise the beautiful future that people yearn for and sing the heartfelt wish of the Chinese people to "Forever follow the Communist Party and transform the world into paradise." The final section, "Celebrating the Harvest by the Happiness River," not only highlights the people's celebration of the harvest of their labor with unparalleled joy but also ultimately concludes the central theme with "The Happiness River's waters ripple like silver waves, laboring hands conquer the heavens, the Communist Party leads in the happiness water, and victory and harvest last for ten thousand years." The entire piece ends with a song of praise for labor and the Party, making it even more powerful and resonant.

    The authors of the "Happiness River Chorus" are four young students. Why are they able to create this relatively successful work today? The authors' common answer is: the Party's education policy of combining education with productive labor has given them a new artistic life.

    These same students underwent profound socialist education during the rectification movement, and the Party's education policy allowed them to break free from their empty personal worlds and immerse themselves in the heated struggle of the masses. They went to northern Jiangsu to engage in labor, performances, folk music collecting, and guidance activities. At the Hehua Chemical Works construction site, they dug earth and sweated alongside the farmers, pushing the same wheelbarrow and shouting the same work songs with the farmers in front of and behind the barrow. "Achieving the river network project as soon as possible" gradually became their common aspiration and common language with the farmers; the blueprint of socialist construction in their minds replaced personal empty fantasies. The soaring drive and heroic images of thousands of ordinary laborers deeply educated them. Because they developed feelings for and loved the working people, they had the creative impulse and sense of responsibility to praise all of this. Therefore, they regarded creating musical works reflecting the river network project as an honor and joy.

    The passion of life generated a creative impulse, but when truly trying to reflect the face of this great era through their work, they still deeply felt the inadequacy of their life experience. They constantly encountered difficulties in the creative process, and the way to overcome these difficulties was still to delve deeper into life and learn from the masses. When they were writing the last movement, they felt that they no longer had the strength to further grasp reality and artistically generalize and elevate it, so they only started from the concept of "ode," and the lyrics contained empty phrases such as "A colorful rainbow hangs in the sky, and the happy sun rises." The music was also dull and uninteresting. Even the people participating in the performance were not satisfied. Later, they changed it to depict the joyous scene of opening the floodgates to release water, but after four revisions, they still couldn't grasp the central idea of this movement. In the end, the enthusiastic masses at the construction site broke the deadlock. They suggested, "Our labor is not only to beautify our mountains and rivers, nor is it just to see the opening of the floodgates to release water. In the final analysis, it is to achieve grain yields of over a thousand catties per mu like the Linji Commune in Huai'an." This simple emotion is precisely the sincere desire of the broad masses of farmers to strive for a harvest to get rid of poverty and backwardness. The opinions of the masses helped the authors grasp the final movement, "Celebrating the Harvest by the Happiness River," which is both a hope and a reality. The authors said with emotion, "Life is like the sea; the deeper you go, the more you gain."

    Because the authors developed feelings for the masses in their common labor life, they not only considered how to reflect the struggle life of the masses in their creation but also thought about how to make it easy for the masses to accept from the beginning. Therefore, the work adopted the language that the masses love to see and hear in the lyrics, especially in the music, using folk songs as the basis for the melodies. They eagerly learned from the masses, recording the heartfelt singing of folk singers and the continuous work songs from the construction site. They observed the performances of the commune's cultural troupes and even traveled hundreds of miles to visit old artists. They selectively adopted folk song materials such as "Guadi Feng" and "Transplanting Rice Seedlings Work Song," but not mechanically or completely copying them. Instead, they developed and enriched them according to the requirements of the content, giving these folk songs new life. The "Happiness River Chorus" has had some successful experiences in this regard. However, as the authors themselves said, due to their superficial understanding of folk music, the work could not use more vivid and lively musical language to write more profound and typical musical images. In the creative process, the authors felt that they could not reflect everything in front of them with a single song or two, so they chose the form of a large chorus.

    The use of harmony, counterpoint, orchestration, and other modern techniques enriched the expressiveness of the work. On the other hand, the traditional formats of large choruses and the excessive pursuit of emotional changes and other musical concepts also limited the expression of inner thoughts and feelings in the creation. As a result, some of the pieces written were not welcomed by the masses. They also excessively pursued the unity of form from beginning to end, and put a musical theme expressing suffering from the first movement into the final "ode," which, of course, made the form and content incompatible. Later, in repeated revisions, the spirit of the new era, the new people, and the rich folk music gradually enabled them to break through some traditional forms and develop and create some new expressive techniques. They further realized that the experiences of foreigners, ancient people, and predecessors must be valued and learned, but only "as a reference for us to create works from the literary and artistic raw materials of the people's lives here and now" (note), and must never be mechanically applied. At the same time, it also enabled them to recognize the correct relationship between theory and practice from productive labor and the creation practice of the "Happiness River Chorus."

    The success of the "Happiness River Chorus" is a preliminary victory in implementing the Party's education policy. It powerfully proves the unparalleled correctness of the Party's education policy and literary and artistic policy.

    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" not to be empty-headed writers or empty-headed artists. He pointed out that "Prominent writers and artists must go among the masses; they must for a long period of time unreservedly and wholeheartedly go among the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers; they must go into the heat of the struggle, go to the only broadest and richest source, in order to observe, experience, study and analyze all the different kinds of people, all the classes, all the masses, all the vivid scenes of life and struggle; observe, experience, study and analyze all these materials, and then only can there be creation." This is a very insightful instruction that uses Marxism-Leninism to explain the relationship between literature and art and life. Therefore, when training young literary and artistic workers, in addition to providing them with the necessary political and professional knowledge, we must also let them regularly go deep into the heated struggles of the masses to participate in productive labor, so that mental labor and physical labor are combined. This can not only improve ideological awareness, enable them to have common thoughts, feelings, and language with the masses, and promote the connection between theory and practice, but also fully discover, cultivate, and develop the artistic talents of the younger generation. The Party's education policy points out the only correct path for cultivating musical talents who are both red and expert and meet the needs of socialist construction.

    生产劳动开出了艺术之花
    ——谈“幸福河大合唱”的创作
    孟波
    上海音乐学院萧白、王九芳、王强、张英明等四位同学创作的“幸福河大合唱”，一开始就受到了河网化工地、公社、工厂的广大群众的欢迎；在上海演出后，也得到音乐界和听众的好评；最近又获得了第七届世界青年与学生联欢节音乐作品比赛的大合唱一等奖。评奖委员会主席、奥地利当代杰出的作曲家马克思，在宣布决定将一等奖授给“幸福河大合唱”时，指出这部作品在独创性和通俗性方面，都是比赛中最重要的作品之一，评奖委员会没有经过争论便决定将第一奖授给它的作者。
    这部作品之所以获得成功，主要是作者用生动的音乐形象，刻划了苏北人民在党的领导下，为了创造千年万代的幸福生活，实现河网化来战胜自然灾害的伟大决心，以及他们在劳动中的冲天干劲。这样动人的题材，实质上也是六亿中国人民在大跃进中意气风发，斗志昂扬的伟大精神面貌的缩影。
    乐曲的“序歌”充分地表现了向大自然宣战的宏伟气魄；第二段“支前”描绘了人民公社动员无穷无尽的人力物力来支援河网化的热烈场面；第三段“推小车”用诙谐但是充满自信的音乐语言，来表现劳动人民在技术革新中的无比智慧；第四段“号子”是工地上的特写镜头，劳动的音调与有力的节奏反映了人们的冲天干劲；第五段“彩云”，是一个抒情的乐章，作者用浪漫主义的手法尽情地歌颂着令人向往的美好未来，并唱出了中国人民的“永远跟着共产党，要把人间变天堂”的衷心愿望；最后一段“幸福河边庆丰收”，不仅突出人们以无比欢乐的情绪来庆祝自己的劳动果实的丰收，而且把主题的中心最后归结到“幸福河水银浪翻，劳动双手战胜天，共产党引来幸福水，胜利丰收万万年”，用对劳动的歌颂，对党的歌颂来结束全曲，因此，更加显得浑厚有力。
      “幸福河大合唱”的作者是四位青年学生，为什么今天他们却能创造出这部比较成功的作品呢？作者共同的回答是：党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，给了他们新的艺术生命。
    也就是这几位同学，整风运动使他们受到了深刻的社会主义教育，党的教育方针使他们跳出了空虚的个人小天地，投入火热的群众斗争生活。他们到苏北进行劳动，演出，采风，辅导等活动，在河网化工地上和农民一起挖土、一起流汗，合推一辆车子，在车前车后和农民喊着同一个劳动号子。“早日实现河网化”逐渐成为他们与农民的共同愿望和共同语言；脑子里的社会主义建设的蓝图代替了个人的空虚幻想。千万个平凡的劳动者的冲天干劲和英雄形象，使他们受到了深刻的教育。由于他们对劳动人民发生了感情；并且热爱他们，也就有了要歌颂这一切的创作冲动和对时代的责任感。所以他们把创作反映河网化的音乐作品，看成是一种荣誉和快乐。
    生活的激情产生了创作冲动，但是真正要想用作品来反映这一伟大时代的面貌的时候，仍然深深地感到生活之不足。在创作中不断遇到困难，而克服困难的办法还是深入生活，向群众学习。当他们写到最后一个乐段的时候，已感到没有力量再来进一步掌握现实，并且在艺术上加以概括和提高，于是只从“颂歌”的概念出发，歌词里出现了“七彩长虹天边挂，幸福的太阳升起来”等空洞无物的句子，音乐也写得枯燥乏味。连参加演唱的人都很不满意，以后又改由描写开闸放水的欢乐景象，但改了四次还是不能把握这一乐段的中心思想。最后还是工地上热情的群众打开了僵局，他们提意见说：“我们的劳动不只是美化我们的山河，也不是光为看到开闸放水，归根结蒂是为了要像淮安的林集公社一样，每亩能收千斤以上的粮食。”这种朴实的感情，正是广大农民要求争取丰收来摆脱一穷二白的真诚愿望。群众的意见帮助作者抓住了这个既是希望又是现实的终曲“幸福河边庆丰收”。作者感慨地说：“生活像大海一样，你走得越深，获得的也越多”。
    由于作者在共同的劳动生活中与群众有了感情，所以在创作中不仅考虑到如何反映群众的斗争生活，而且一开始就想到了如何使群众易于接受。因此，作品在歌词，特别是在音乐上，采取了群众喜闻乐见的语言，以民歌作为音调的基础。他们如饥如渴地向群众学习，把民歌手真情流露的歌唱，工地上此起彼落、从不停歇的劳动号子记录下来；观摩公社文工团的演出；甚至跑上百里路程去寻访老艺人。他们有选择地采用了“刮地风”、“插秧号子”等民歌素材，但并不是机械的原封不动的搬用，而是根据内容的要求来发展它丰富它，给这些民歌以新的生命。“幸福河大合唱”在这方面是有了一些成功的经验。可是，正像作者自己所说的：由于对民间音乐的了解还很肤浅，使得这个作品还不能用更鲜明更生动的音乐语言，写出更深刻更典型的音乐形象。在创作过程中，作者感到用单独的一首或两首歌曲无法反映面前的一切，因此选择了大合唱的形式。
    和声，对位，配器等现代手法的运用，一方面使得作品的表现力更为丰富；另一方面那些传统的大合唱的格式及过分追求调情变换等音乐构思，也曾使得创作中内在思想感情的表达受到一定的限制，结果写出来的有些曲子不受群众欢迎。他们也曾过多地从音乐形式上追求前后的统一，而把第一乐段的一个表现苦难的音乐主题放到最后的“颂歌”中去，这当然会使得形式与内容格格不入。以后在反复的修改中，新的时代，新的人民的精神面貌，以及丰富的民间音乐，使他们逐渐突破了某些传统的形式，发展与创造了一些新的表现手法。他们进一步体会到外国的、古代的、前人的经验，必须重视和学习，但只能“作为我们从此时此地的人民生活中的文学艺术原料创造作品时候的借鉴”（注），决不能生搬硬套。同时，也使他们从生产劳动及“幸福河大合唱”的创作实践中，认识到理论与实践的正确关系。
    “幸福河大合唱”获得成功是贯彻党的教育方针的初步胜利。它有力地证明了党的教育方针和文艺方针的无比正确。
    毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中曾教导我们不要做空头的文学家，或空头的艺术家。他指出“有出息的文学家，艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察，体验，研究，分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学艺术的原始材料，然后才有可能进入创作过程。”这是运用马克思列宁主义来阐明文艺与生活的关系非常精辟的指示。因此，我们在对青年文艺工作者进行培养的时候，除了要给以必要的政治、业务知识外，也必须让他们定期地深入到群众的火热斗争中去参加生产劳动，使脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合，这不仅可以提高思想觉悟，使他们与群众有共同的思想感情和语言，促进理论与实际的联系，而且也可以充分发现、培养、发展青年一代的艺术才能。党的教育方针，为培养符合于社会主义建设需要的又红又专的音乐人才，指出了一条唯一正确的道路。
