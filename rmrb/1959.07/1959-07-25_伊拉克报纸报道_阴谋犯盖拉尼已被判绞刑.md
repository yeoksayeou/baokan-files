Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 23rd: The "News" here reported today that the Iraqi Special Higher Military Court has sentenced the conspirator Rashid Ali al-Gailani to hang for attempting to launch a coup on December 9, 1958, to overthrow the current Iraqi regime. The conspiracy was uncovered beforehand.

The verdict and the military prosecutor Amin's speech during the trial were published in a booklet recently issued by the military court.

The newspaper said that the verdict was made at a secret trial session on December 17, 1958.

The court's verdict, published by the "News," pointed out that the defendant had established a pseudo-organization called the "Arab Brotherhood," and they were preparing to carry out a conspiracy to overthrow the current regime. Rashid Ali al-Gailani was to serve as the head of the new government.

The verdict stated that the defendant confessed that he had instigated his nephew, Mubdir al-Gailani, and his son-in-law, Abdul Rahim al-Rawi, to carry out the conspiracy. Mubdir al-Gailani contacted officials of the United Arab Republic (UAR) to obtain money and weapons from there, and at the same time, he recruited some tribesmen and soldiers to participate in the conspiracy, sparing no means to drive out Qasim or even assassinate him.

The verdict stated that the defendant hoped to restore the feudal system in Iraq. They also wanted the UAR to invade the Republic of Iraq.

Gailani is the leader of the Independence Party and has served as Prime Minister of the former Iraqi government twice.
