This newspaper's Ulan Bator dispatch on the 28th reports: The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party recently made a decision on improving the Marxist-Leninist theoretical level and political economics knowledge of party and government leaders.

The decision stated that it is necessary to educate every party member and leader of state organs to be good at proceeding from Marxist-Leninist theory and at implementing the Party's principles when dealing with problems. Only by enabling party members and cadres to grasp Marxist-Leninist theory and creatively apply it to the practice of socialist construction can the phenomena of sticking to conventions and irresponsibility in work be overcome. The decision pointed out that in the current stage of comprehensively carrying out socialist construction, it is impossible for cadres to lead and organize the masses and achieve results in their work without knowledge.

The decision stipulates that the economics school and the Marxist-Leninist night university, which originally included the vast majority of party and government leading personnel in their studies, should be merged. The teaching syllabus of various courses at the Marxist-Leninist night university should be revised to further improve the quality of teaching. Starting from the 1959 to 1960 academic year, each province should organize provincial-level leaders to study agricultural and animal husbandry economics.

The decision tasked the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party with periodically inspecting the Marxist-Leninist theoretical study situation of party and government leaders and all party members, and requested the central newspapers to widely publish learning materials on political economics.

    蒙古人民革命党中央作出决定
    加强领导干部理论学习
    本报乌兰巴托28日电　此间报纸报道：蒙古人民革命党中央委员会最近就提高党政领导人员的马克思列宁主义理论水平和政治经济学知识作出了一项决定。
    决定说，必须教育每个党员和国家机关的领导人员在处理问题时要善于从马克思列宁主义的理论出发和善于贯彻党的原则。只有使党员、干部掌握马克思列宁主义理论并且创造性地运用到社会主义建设实践中去，才能克服工作中的墨守陈规和不负责任的现象。决定指出，在全面进行社会主义建设的当前阶段，干部没有知识是不可能领导和组织群众，并在工作中获得成绩的。
    决定规定，把原来包括绝大部分党政领导人员参加学习的经济学校和马克思列宁主义夜大学合并，修改马克思列宁主义夜大学各种课程的教学大纲，进一步提高教学质量。从1959年到1960年学年开始，各省应组织省级领导人员学习农牧业经济。
    决定责成蒙古人民革命党中央宣传部定期检查党政负责人和全体党员马克思列宁主义理论的学习情况，要求中央报纸广泛刊登有关政治经济学的学习材料。
