Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 27th – The Indonesian Core Cabinet held a meeting today presided over by President Sukarno. The Ministry of Information announced the decisions made at the meeting this evening.

President Sukarno issued a decree prohibiting members of political parties from serving as central and local government officials who receive salaries at the highest standard stipulated by the 1955 Government Employee Salary Regulations, as well as directors and members of the board of directors and management of companies, enterprises, and agencies that are directly or indirectly, wholly or partially, state-owned. This decree is equally valid for personnel of the armed forces and the national police.

It was announced that Indonesian President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Sukarno appointed Supreme Court President Wirjono Prodjodikoro as the President's ministerial-level legal advisor.

According to a decision made by the President, Attorney General and Military Auditor Gatot Tarunamihardja is authorized to prosecute those who obstruct the provision of essential necessities – food and clothing – to the people, in accordance with the criminal law, and to demand sentences of imprisonment for one to twenty years, or life imprisonment, or even the death penalty.

A presidential decree on the establishment of an agency to supervise the activities of state organs was also announced tonight.

The final decision made by the President stipulates that those members of parliament who have not sworn an oath in accordance with the 1945 Constitution will be given the opportunity to take the oath before the final deadline of August 17th this year. Those members who do not take the oath before this deadline will be disqualified from their positions as members of parliament.

Deputy Minister of Information Maradi explained to the press on July 27th that the decision to prohibit members of political parties from holding senior positions in the state civil service could be considered as the starting point for separating all civil servants in this country from political parties.

Maradi said that governors are also included among the state civil servants who receive the highest salaries. Governors are important officials who hold leadership positions and are also decision-makers. The purpose of prohibiting them from participating in political parties is to eliminate and get rid of the political influence of political parties in state organs.

It is believed that this decision by the government is one of the measures it is taking to reduce the influence of political parties. A political party law to reduce the number and scope of activities of political parties is currently being drafted.

    印度尼西亚总统苏加诺颁布法令
    禁止政党党员任高级官员
    新华社雅加达27日电　印度尼西亚核心内阁今天在苏加诺总统主持下举行了会议。情报部今天晚上宣布了这次会议所作出的决定。
    苏加诺总统颁布的一项法令规定，禁止各政党的党员担任按照1955年政府官员工资条例规定的最高薪给标准领取薪金的中央和地方政府官员，以及直接或间接、全部或局部是国家财产的一些公司、企业和机关的董事会和管理处的董事和成员。这条法令对于武装部队和国家警察的人员同样有效。
    据宣布，印度尼西亚总统兼武装部队最高统帅苏加诺任命最高法院院长维尔约诺·普罗佐迪科罗为总统的部长级法律顾问。
    根据总统作出的决定，检察总长兼军事审计官加托特·塔鲁纳米哈加受权对阻挠实现为人民提供重要的必需品——粮食和衣服——的人，根据刑法提起诉讼，并且要求处以一年到二十年的有期徒刑或无期徒刑，甚至死刑。
    今天晚上还宣布了关于成立监督国家机关活动的机构的总统法令。
    总统作出的最后一个决定规定，那些没有根据1945年宪法宣誓的议员将获得机会在今年8月17日这个最后期限之前宣誓。那些在这个期限之前不宣誓的议员将被取消议员的资格。
    情报部副部长马拉迪27日对报界解释禁止各政党党员担任国家高级公务人员的决定说，这个决定，可以被认为是要这个国家所有的公务人员脱离政党的起点。
    马拉迪说，省长也包括在国家的领取最高薪金的公务人员之中。省长是重要的官员，他们居于领导地位，同时是决策者。禁止他们参加政党的目的是消除和摆脱政党在国家机关中的政治影响。
    据认为，政府的这一决定是它为缩小政党的影响而采取的措施之一。目前正在拟定一个缩减政党的数目和活动范围的政党法。
