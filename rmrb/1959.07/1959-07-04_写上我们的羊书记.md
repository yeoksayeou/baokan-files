Write About Our Secretary Yang
Set an Example

I stayed in Wuzhai County, Shanxi Province, for seven days. The local cadres always suggested to me: "Write about our Secretary Yang! His stories couldn't be hauled away even by a train." And they also enthusiastically told me many stories about "Secretary Yang":

The mountains have many slopes and are large, so not many crops can be grown, but animal husbandry can be greatly developed. However, county party secretary Zhang Chuyuan found several times during his deep dives into the mountains that some people in the mountains had doubts about developing animal husbandry. They said that Kelan Mountain is a place of "many mountains, little land, and thick stones, where one ends up selling their bones after death." The idea of going down the mountain was spreading among the masses like a highly contagious disease.

One day, he arrived at Huacha. Huacha is a thirteen-li-long gully with only thirty-one households and one hundred and three people in seven villages. When he went there, some families were dismantling their houses, preparing to move down the mountain. With a very heavy heart, he looked at the whole gully up and down, inside and out, and felt that there was great potential for developing animal husbandry here. He found some elderly people to discuss the matter and persuaded them to settle down and turn the poor Huacha into a rich Huacha. The elderly people laughed bitterly when they heard this, saying, "Old Zhang! Dreams are good to dream!" At this time, Zhang Chuyuan felt even more deeply that unless an example was set in the mountainous area and a model was established, the masses would not believe that poor mountain gullies could become rich mountain gullies, and it would be even less possible to stabilize the emotions of the masses. So he decided to personally turn this poorest Huacha into a banner for getting rich in the mountains.

He got to work immediately. Zhang Chuyuan visited from inside the Party to outside the Party, door to door, specifically accounting, for three or four days in a row. He told the masses: "Huacha has 250,000 mu of grassland slopes. If we work hard for three years, we can develop 1,500 sheep. With sheep, we will have fertilizer, and we won't have to worry about growing more grain!" The masses felt good when they heard this. But there were also concerns: For three or four years, the whole gully still had more than three hundred sheep, and there had been no development. Would it be possible to develop them in the future? At this time, Zhang Chuyuan, as an old shepherd (he had herded sheep for landlords for eleven years before), specifically discussed sheep management and feeding methods with the shepherds, helping them improve their techniques. He also proposed methods to increase reproduction and improve grazing. This made people feel enlightened.

Afterwards, Zhang Chuyuan would always go to Huacha to run around when he went to the countryside. Every time he went, he would check the grazing situation of the sheep, sometimes even running with the shepherds for half a day to help them solve problems. By 1956, Huacha had greatly improved. There were more sheep, and the crops were growing well. People's hearts were also settled.

By last year, Huacha had become a red banner in the Kelan mountainous area. The number of sheep reached more than 1,200, with an average of thirty-seven per household. There were more than sixty large animals and more than one hundred pigs. There was also more fertilizer, and the yield per mu of grain jumped from fifty to seventy jin to more than two hundred and twenty jin. At this time, the economic development of Huacha had a profound impact on the people in the mountainous areas, and the reputation of "Secretary Yang" spread with the emergence of a large number of Huacha-style villages.

        Two Litters of Lambs

In 1958, the Party put forward the call for a great leap forward in production. At that time, after discussing with many animal husbandry workers, shepherds, and grassroots party organizations in the county, Zhang Chuyuan proposed a plan for a great development of sheep flocks: to increase by 45% on the basis of the original 89,000 sheep!

Unexpectedly, this plan greatly surprised some animal husbandry cadres who came down from the province. One cadre said to Zhang Chuyuan: "Your plan is too big, I'm afraid it can't be completed!" Zhang Chuyuan was stunned when he heard this, and asked: "Why?" The cadre said: "If you don't rely on buying, just breed them yourself, you can't increase the original number by 45%. No sheep anywhere in the world has such a high breeding rate!"

"The question is reasonable!" Zhang Chuyuan thought after talking with the provincial cadres: "What method can be used to improve the breeding rate of sheep?" He thought of the scene when he was herding sheep, and after thinking about it, he suddenly thought of the idea of ​​giving birth to two litters of lambs a year. He hurriedly ran to Piandao Gully to discuss with his old friend, the shepherd Liu Wanhai. Liu Wanhai said without even thinking when he heard that he wanted the sheep to have two litters of lambs a year: "No, the weather is too cold!" Zhang Chuyuan wanted to ask him to try a few, but he didn't agree. So he ran to Huacha, and the shepherds in Huacha also disagreed. He ran to Yan Family Village and found the branch secretary Yang Zisheng. Yang Zisheng said: "We tried it last year, and it failed!" At this time, someone persuaded him: "Old Zhang, forget it, sheep have always had one litter a year, how can they have two litters?" But Zhang Chuyuan didn't believe it and ran to Wei'er Gully. This time he was happy. It turned out that Wei'er Gully had tried it in 1957 and gave birth to twenty-four winter lambs. He immediately summarized the experience of Wei'er Gully and ran to Huacha to promote it. He held a party branch meeting in Huacha and made a decision to try two-litter breeding. This is how the work started; Piandao Gully also wanted to test sixty-three, and Yan Family Village also decided to mate five hundred. Seeing that the time was ripe, he seized the opportunity to hold an on-site meeting. The county's "two litters of lambs a year" work was promoted in this way.

The method of promoting "two litters of lambs a year" worked very well. Songjia Gully mated three hundred and forty-six and gave birth to six hundred and ninety lambs. At the end of the year, the county counted a total of more than 70,000 sheep, nearly 80% of the original number!

    Originally, He Was Also a "Sheep Doctor"

More than ten days before I arrived in Wuzhai, Heshangquan had such an incident:

In order to greatly develop animal husbandry, Songjia Gully Commune bought seven hundred and twenty sheep from Taiyuan in one go and gave them to Heshangquan to graze. Unexpectedly, not many days after this group of sheep arrived in the village, they contracted scabies. It started small, but later it became big. All seven hundred and twenty sheep were covered in scabies, and one hundred died in a few days. The ones that didn't die didn't eat or drink. The shepherds and breeders were spinning around the branch secretary Ma Youcai. Ma Youcai, who had been herding sheep for twenty-four years, had never seen sheep with such severe scabies, and he was so anxious that he couldn't sit or stand. Some commune members said: "This time, the Great Leap Forward is finished!"

At this critical moment, Zhang Chuyuan arrived at Heshangquan. After learning about the situation, he took off his clothes and plunged into the smelly sheepfold, checking the sheep one by one. After the inspection, he gathered the cadres of the animal husbandry station, the party secretary of the commune, and the shepherds to study. He asked everyone if they had any solutions. Ma Youcai said: "It may work to rub them with boiled tung oil." He supported this opinion and, based on his eleven years of herding experience, also proposed two methods of rubbing the scabies with DDT mixed with kerosene and 666 aqueous solution.

The next morning, he took the deputy secretary of the commune, Yang Zizai, and two cadres from the animal husbandry station and personally started to treat the sheep's scabies. From morning to one o'clock in the afternoon, all six hundred and twenty living sheep were smeared with medicine. He also disinfected the sheepfold with 666 raw powder and quicklime.

After the sheep were smeared with medicine, an abnormal situation suddenly appeared: they didn't eat or drink, and they didn't even walk. Ma Youcai quietly said to Zhang Chuyuan: "Old Zhang, will they be burned to death?" Zhang Chuyuan was also unsure. He said: "Let's see, I did this when I was herding sheep, and it worked."

One day, two days, three days... Six days passed, the sheep's scabies scabbed over, and they began to eat grass, jumping and kicking. Zhang Chuyuan breathed a sigh of relief. However, he was still not at ease. Before leaving, he instructed Ma Youcai: Be sure to bathe the sheep with lukewarm water at twenty-five degrees Celsius.

Ten days later, just as Ma Youcai of Heshangquan was reporting to the Wuzhai County Committee of the Communist Party of China on the phone that "the scabies of the six hundred and twenty sick sheep have been cured," the villagers also composed a song for Zhang Chuyuan: "There is a big shepherd in Wuzhai, Secretary Yang is a sheep doctor, he cured all six hundred sick sheep, he is the confidant of our masses."

        What is he thinking?

Because Zhang Chuyuan was attending an enlarged meeting of the county party committee, I didn't see him for three days. After the meeting ended on the fourth day, he was busy going down again. So I only visited him briefly before he left.

Perhaps because of long-term hard work, this forty-seven-year-old secretary already has a face full of wrinkles. He is bald, wearing a worn gray cloth cadre uniform. From the open neckline, you can see that he is wearing a red city cloth waistband, which is unique to people in northwestern Shanxi. He wears a pair of home-made cloth shoes.

The room is unusually simple. The kang is covered with a cloth quilt, covered with a half-old sheet. There is only a table and a cabinet in the room. A thick stack of books is piled on top of the cabinet. In addition to political books such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," many are books about the breeding and management experience of livestock and poultry such as cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, pigs, sheep, and chickens. Some of them are quite broken, indicating that the owner has read them many times!

After explaining my intention and telling him many stories I had heard about him these past few days, I asked him directly: "What are you thinking about now?"

"What a big question!" He smiled embarrassedly and said: "There are many ideas..." Then he told me: He wanted to study for a few more years, and he also wanted to live in an animal husbandry school... But the most important are two, one is what method can be used to turn this area known for "poverty" into wealth, and what method can be used to breed livestock faster. Another idea is: in three to five years, at the latest in the third five-year plan, can we cultivate a "Wuzhai breed of sheep"? This kind of sheep is big, has good wool, and one sheep can shear more than ten kilograms of wool a year! If possible, he said: "Then Wuzhai's animal husbandry will not only improve its own living standards and provide the country with more wool, meat, and leather, but also be able to support the whole country with more and better breeds of sheep!"

### 写上我们的羊书记

    写上我们的羊书记
    树标兵
    到山西五寨县住了七天，那里的干部总是建议我：“写写我们的羊书记吧！他的故事用火车也拉不完。”并且也热情地给我讲了许多关于
  “羊书记”的故事：
    山多坡大，不能多种庄稼，可以大量发展畜牧业。可是县委书记张初元几次深入山里工作，都发现山里有些群众对发展畜牧业思想上有怀疑。他们说岢岚山是“山多地少石头厚，死了落个卖骨透”。下山思想像烈性传染病一样在群众中传播着。
    一天，他到了化岔。化岔一条沟十三里长，满沟七个村才有三十一户人家，一百零三口人。他去的时候，有的人家正拆房子，准备搬下山。他怀着十分沉重的心情，把一条沟的上上下下、里里外外看了个够，觉得这里发展畜牧业大有可为。他就找了一些老年人商量，劝他们安下心来，把穷化岔变成富化岔。老年人一听，苦笑着说：“老张呵！梦好做呵！”这时，张初元就更深刻地感到：不在山区做出个榜样来，树立个标兵，群众就不会相信穷山沟可以变成富山沟，更没有可能把群众的情绪安定下来。于是他决心亲手把这个最贫困的化岔变成山区致富的旗帜。
    说干就干。张初元从党内到党外，登门访问，具体算账，一连闹了三、四天。他告诉群众说：“化岔有二十五万亩草坡，大干三年，发展一千五百只羊。有了羊就有了肥料，就不愁多打粮！”群众一听觉得满好。但是也有顾虑：三、四年了，全沟三百多只羊仍然是三百多只，没见有发展，以后就能发展？这时，张初元就以一个老羊工（他以前曾给地主放过十一年羊）的身份，和牧工们具体讨论羊的管理、饲养办法，帮助他们改进技术。还提出了增加繁殖、改进放牧的办法。这一下人们心里亮堂了。
    以后，张初元下乡总要转到化岔去跑跑，每次去都要检查羊的放牧情况，有时甚至跟上羊工一跑半天，帮他们解决问题。到1956年化岔就大有起色了。羊多了，庄稼也长得不错。人心也安定了。
    到去年，化岔就成了岢岚山区的一面红旗。羊达到一千二百多只，每户平均三十七只。有了六十多头大牲畜，一百多口猪。肥料也多起来了，粮食亩产由五十至七十斤，一跃为二百二十多斤。这时，化岔的经济的发展已经对山区的人们发生了深远影响，“羊书记”的名声也就随着大批化岔式的村庄的出现而传开了。
        两茬羔
    1958年，党提出了生产大跃进的号召。当时张初元和全县许多畜牧工作者、牧工、基层党组织讨论后，提出了一个羊群大发展的计划：要在原有羊八万九千只的基础上，增加45％！
    不想这个计划使省里下来的一些畜牧工作干部大吃了一惊。一个干部和张初元说：“你们的计划太大，恐怕完不成！”张初元一听楞住了，就问：“为什么呀？”这个干部说：
  “如果不依靠买进，光自己繁殖，想增加原数的45％，那办不到，世界上任何地方的羊都没有这么高的繁殖率！”
    “问题提的有道理！”张初元和省里干部谈完话后就想开了：“用个什么办法提高羊的繁殖率呢？”他想到了放羊时候的情景，想来想去，忽然想起了个一年生两茬羔的主意。就匆匆地跑到偏道沟找他的老朋友牧工刘完孩商量。刘完孩一听说要羊一年下两茬羔，连想也没想就说：“不行，天气冷啊！”张初元想请他试几只，他没有答应。于是又跑到化岔，化岔的牧工也不同意。他又跑到阎家庄，找到支部书记杨自生，杨自生说：“去年试验过，失败了！”这时有人劝他：“老张，算了吧，自古以来羊一年生一茬，怎能生两茬呢？”可是张初元不信，又跑到卫儿沟，这一下他可乐了。原来卫儿沟1957年试过，生下二十四只冬羔。他立即总结了卫儿沟的经验，又跑到化岔去推广，在化岔开了个党支部会，作出了试行两茬配种的决定。这一下工作就展开了；偏道沟也要试验六十三只，阎家庄也决定配五百只。他见时机已经成熟了，就抓住机会开了个现场会议。全县的“一年两茬羔”工作就这样推开了。
    推行“一年生两茬羔”的办法效果很好，宋家沟配了三百四十六只，生了六百九十只羔。年底全县一统计，共繁殖羊七万多只，将近原有数的80％！
    原来还是个“羊医生”
    我到五寨的前十多天，和尚泉发生了这样一件事：
    为了大发展畜牧业宋家沟公社从太原一次就买了七百二十只羊，给和尚泉牧放。没想到，这群羊到村里不几天，就害起疥疮来。起初小，后来闹大了，七百二十只羊，只只满身疥疮，几天死了一百只。没死的也不吃不喝了，牧工和饲养员围着支部书记马有才打转转，放了二十四年羊的马有才也没见过羊害这么利害的疥疮，急得坐也不是站也不是。有的社员说：“这一下可把大跃进闹完蛋了！”
    正在这个紧要关头，张初元赶到了和尚泉。他了解了一下情况，把衣服一脱就钻进了臭哄哄的羊圈里，一只只地把羊检查了个遍。检查完就把畜牧站的干部、公社的党委书记和牧工们找在一起研究。他问大家有什么办法没有？马有才说：“用熬滚的桐油搓也许能行。”他支持了这种意见，并且根据自己十一年放羊经验，又提出了用滴滴涕配煤油、六六六水剂搓疥的两种办法。
    第二天一早，他就带着公社副支书杨自在和畜牧站的两个干部，亲自下手给羊治疥疮，从早晨一直到中午一点钟，把活着的六百二十只羊都搽上了药。还用六六六原粉和生石灰在羊圈中消了毒。
    羊搽上药以后，突然出现了个异常情况：不吃不喝，连走也不走了。马有才悄悄地和张初元说：“老张，烧不坏吧？”张初元心里也不落实。就说：“看看吧，我放羊时这么办可也见效。”
    一天、两天、三天……六天过去了，羊的疥疮结了痂，开始欢蹦乱跳地吃起草来，张初元才松了口气。但是，他还不放心，临走时，又嘱咐马有才：一定要用摄氏二十五度的温水给羊洗洗澡。
    十天以后，正当和尚泉的马有才从电话上给中共五寨县委报告“六百二十只病羊的疥疮已经痊愈”的时候，村里的群众也为张初元编了一首歌：“五寨有个大羊工，羊书记是羊医生，六百病羊全治好，是咱群众知心人。”
        他想些什么？
    因为张初元正开县委扩大会议，我三天没见他。第四天会议结束后，他又忙着下去。所以我只是在他临行前抽空拜访了一下。
    也许是因为长期的辛劳，这个年仅四十七岁的书记已经满脸皱纹了。光头，穿着一身旧了的灰布干部服，从敞开的领口处，可以看到他里边穿着一件晋西北人特有的红市布腰子。脚上穿着一双家做布鞋。
    屋里异常俭朴。炕上铺着一床布被子，用一条半旧的床单盖起来。屋里只有一张桌子和一只柜子，柜顶上堆着厚厚一叠书，除“毛泽东选集”等一类政治书籍外，不少是关于牛、马、驴、骡、猪、羊、鸡等家畜家禽的饲养、管理经验介绍的书籍。有的已经相当破了，说明主人不知已看过了多少遍！
    我说明来意和告诉他这几天听到的许多关于他的故事后，直截了当地问他：“你现在想些什么呢？”
      “好大的问题！”他为难地笑了笑说：
  “想法很多……”接着他告诉我：他想再读几年书，也想住住畜牧学校，……但是最重要的有两个，一个是用什么办法能把这片以
  “贫困”著称的地区变富，用什么办法能使牲畜更快地繁殖。另一个想法是：三年到五年，最晚到第三个五年计划，能不能培养出一种“五寨种羊”来？这种羊个头大，毛好，一年一只羊能剪十几斤毛！如果能够，他说：“那五寨的畜牧业就不仅仅是提高自己的生活，多供应给国家些羊毛、肉和皮张了，而且是可以用更多更好的羊种支援全国！”（附图片）
