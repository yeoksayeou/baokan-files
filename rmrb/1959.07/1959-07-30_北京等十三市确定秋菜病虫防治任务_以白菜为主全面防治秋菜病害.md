Xinhua News Agency report: The joint prevention committee for eliminating vegetable pests and diseases in thirteen cities in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, including Taiyuan, Tianjin, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and Beijing, held its second meeting in Jinan in mid-July to study and determine the tasks and measures for preventing and controlling fall vegetable pests and diseases.

The meeting pointed out that the thirteen cities in the joint prevention area share the common characteristics of large planting areas for fall vegetables, long supply seasons, and reliance on the fall harvest for winter and spring vegetable consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the policy of "vegetables as the key link" in suburban areas, effectively carry out the production and pest and disease prevention of fall vegetables, and ensure a bumper harvest of fall vegetables.

The meeting determined that the specific requirements for fall vegetable pest and disease prevention this year are: to focus on inhibiting the three major diseases of Chinese cabbage, namely soft rot, downy mildew, and virus disease (i.e., *guding* or solitary seedling of Chinese cabbage), and carry out comprehensive prevention and control of fall vegetable pests and diseases; and to study and accumulate effective methods and experience for prevention and control, laying the foundation for completely eliminating the three major diseases in the future.

In order to effectively complete the task of preventing and controlling fall vegetable pests and diseases, the meeting required all localities to establish and improve pest and disease prediction and forecasting organizations, to understand the local patterns of fall vegetable pest and disease occurrence, to grasp favorable opportunities, to organize campaigns, to strike swiftly and fiercely, and to carry out prevention and control movements that emphasize early treatment, small-scale treatment, complete treatment, continuous treatment, comprehensive treatment, and thorough treatment, so that pests and diseases are eliminated in their initial stages. The meeting pointed out that as the types of vegetables in the joint prevention area continue to increase, the patterns of pest and disease occurrence will also gradually change. Therefore, it is necessary to promptly grasp the changing trends of pests and diseases through experimental observation.

Regarding pesticides and equipment for pest and disease control, the meeting pointed out that planning and preparation should be based on the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods and walking on two legs. In order to better exchange experiences, the meeting proposed strengthening the connections between cities within the joint prevention area to facilitate collaborative prevention and control and to promptly eradicate pests.

    北京等十三市确定秋菜病虫防治任务
    以白菜为主全面防治秋菜病害
    据新华社讯　晋、冀、鲁、豫、陕的太原、天津、济南、郑州、西安和北京等十三个市的消灭蔬菜病虫害联防委员会，7月中旬在济南召开第二次会议，研究和确定了秋季蔬菜病虫防治任务和措施。
    会议指出，联防区内十三市的秋菜都有播种面积大、供应季节长、“冬春吃菜靠一秋”的共同特点，因此必须贯彻执行近郊区以菜为纲的方针，切实作好秋菜的生产和防治病虫害工作，保证秋菜大丰收。
    会议确定，今年秋菜病虫防治的具体要求是：以抑制大白菜的软腐病、霜霉病、毒素病（即大白菜孤丁）等三大病害为主要内容，开展秋菜病虫的全面防治工作；并研究积累防治的有效方法和经验，为今后彻底消灭三大病害打下基础。
    为了切实完成秋菜病虫害防治任务，会议要求各地建立和健全病虫预测预报组织，摸清当地秋菜病虫发生规律，掌握有利时机，组织战役，巧打猛攻，开展治早、治小、治了和连续治、全面治、彻底治的防治运动，使病虫消灭在初生阶段。会议指出：由于联防区蔬菜种类不断增加，病虫发生规律也会逐渐变化，因此必须通过试验观察，及时掌握病虫变迁趋势。
    对于防治病虫的药械，会议指出要根据土洋结合、两条腿走路的方针筹划和准备。为了更好地交流经验，会议提出要加强联防区内各市之间的联系，以利协作防治，及时扑灭虫害。
