Be Good at Decisive Action

　　Much deliberation leads to sound judgment. Consulting with the masses on everything, listening to opinions from all sides, and analyzing and studying them, this is much deliberation. Based on the development of the objective situation, further judging the results of the analysis and research, and acting immediately, this is sound judgment. Being good at decisive action allows one to take the initiative step by step, do a good job, and promote production.

　　The most important method of the Shuangxi Brigade Party Branch of the Shinan Commune in Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, in correctly implementing the mass line is that they are able to clearly recognize that "if the members of the commune are mobilized to think of ways together, things will be easy to handle," and that there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome, and they consult the masses when encountering difficulties. They are also able to make correct judgments based on the specific circumstances in the debates of different opinions, and take decisive action. This spring, they changed the old practice of plowing green manure late and plowed it half a month earlier, completing the transplanting ahead of schedule; and because the early rice received fertilizer early and grew vigorously. This shows that they are able to take decisive action.

　　The practice of the Shuangxi Brigade Party Branch truly embodies much deliberation and sound judgment. Therefore, they can take the initiative in everything in their work and promote the advancement of agricultural production. The important harvest of this Party branch in implementing the mass line proves that consulting with the masses more, studying and grasping the specific situation and development trend, and taking decisive action are extremely important working methods. The Party branches of the production teams of each commune can apply these methods flexibly in accordance with the spirit of these practices.

    要善于当机立断
    多谋才能善断。事事同群众商量，倾听各方面的意见，加以分析研究，这是多谋。根据客观形势的发展，进一步把分析研究的结果作出判断，立即行动，这是善断。善于当机立断，就能步步主动，作好工作，推进生产。
    安徽桐城县石南公社双溪大队党支部，正确贯彻群众路线的最主要的办法是：他们既能够明确认识到“如果发动社员大家共同想办法，事情就容易办”，就没有克服不了的困难，遇有困难问题就向群众请教；还能够在不同的意见争辩中，根据具体情况，做出正确的判断，当机立断。他们在今年春季，改变了迟犁绿肥的老规矩，提早了半个月犁翻，提前完成了插秧；并且因为早稻得肥力早，生长旺盛。这就表现了他们能够善于当机立断。
    双溪大队党支部的作法，真正体现了多谋善断。所以，他们在工作中就能事事主动，促进了农业生产的前进。这个党支部贯彻群众路线的重要收获，证明了多同群众商量，研究和掌握具体情况和发展趋势，当机立断，是极其重要的工作方法。各公社生产队的党支部，可以根据这些作法的精神，灵活运用。
