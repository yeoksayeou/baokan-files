Living Among the Masses

Comrade Li Shixiang, the Party Secretary of Anwen Commune in Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, is not only a good friend of cadres but also a confidant of the masses. He is familiar with the natural conditions and political and economic situations of every production team. In the Shenze Brigade, which he focuses on helping, he can even name all cadres above the level of small team leader and active members of the commune, and he has also figured out their temperaments, understood their personalities, and knows their interests and demands, becoming their most trusted friend.

Take the two main cadres of the Shenze Production Team, for example. Branch Secretary Comrade Chen Chengzhi is experienced and humble in his work, but his thinking is a bit conservative and not enthusiastic enough about advanced things. Production Team Leader Comrade Chen Chengda had a lot of enthusiasm at the beginning of his work, but he tended to waver when he encountered difficulties, often starting strong but finishing weakly. When Comrade Li Shixiang came to work in this team, he always praised Comrade Chen Chengzhi's experience and humility, pointing out his shortcomings. For Chen Chengda, he always encouraged his enthusiasm, reminded him not to be intimidated by difficulties, and helped him overcome his "starting strong but finishing weakly" problem. As a result of this frequent interaction, these two have promoted their strengths and gradually overcome their weaknesses. Now, both of them regard Comrade Li Shixiang as a good teacher and helpful friend.

He gets along well with the cadres, and the commune members also regard him as a confidant. Wherever he goes, many commune members take the initiative to talk to him. Some state their hopes to him, some tell him about their difficulties, and some report problems in production and the style of the cadres. Relying on these commune members to actively report situations helps him avoid subjectivism in his work. During the winter planting last year, Chen Guangfu, a commune member of the Shenze Production Team, took the initiative to talk to him, saying that some commune members were not happy with the requirement that the amount of wheat sown per mu should be 30 jin, fearing that they would not have a good harvest. He felt that this situation was very important, so he immediately convened a forum with the commune members who had opinions to further listen to their views. From the forum, he learned that the amount of wheat sown in 1957 was 8 jin per mu, and now it was required to be increased to 30 jin, so it was no wonder that the masses had concerns. Therefore, after discussing with the cadres, he changed the original regulation. Except for some experimental fields that still insisted on sowing 30 jin per mu, the rest could determine the amount of sowing according to different conditions such as soil quality and variety, without forcing uniformity, but it must be appropriately densely planted, and the practice of sowing 8 jin of seeds per mu could not be restored. From the practical results this year, if they had not listened to the masses and had not considered the specific circumstances, but had uniformly required sowing 30 jin, they would have suffered undue losses.

Some people may find it strange, how can Comrade Li Shixiang get along so well with the cadres and the masses? In fact, there is nothing strange about it. Because except for going to the county for meetings, he is a person who takes off his shoes and goes into the fields all year round, often working with cadres and commune members. Whether it is building water conservancy projects, transplanting rice seedlings, or accumulating fertilizer, he always takes the lead and works even harder than the average commune member. For example, when building the Senwo Reservoir, the commune members could only carry 40 loads of soil a day, but he carried 65 loads; the commune members had to rest after ramming 60 times, but he could ram 200 times in a row.

Never Letting Go of Shortcomings

Comrade Li Shixiang gets along well with the cadres and the masses, and everyone agrees on this. However, everyone also has a common reflection: Comrade Li Shixiang is so strict!

What's going on? It turns out that he is always laughing and talking with everyone in ordinary times, and he is very amiable; however, if he finds that a certain cadre has relatively major shortcomings, especially when this shortcoming will become a tendency, he is quite strict and never compromises.

In February of this year, when he was inspecting the work, he found that some brigade cadres had simplified their work style and did not consult with the masses on matters; some individual cadres also had an ungrounded work style. He knew that although this situation was individual, if it was not stopped in time, it might gradually spread and affect the current production. After exchanging opinions with the comrades of the commune Party committee, he decided to use the method of rectification to guide everyone in the right direction.

Cadres from the commune and brigades participated in this rectification meeting. At the meeting, he first made a self-criticism and presented the facts of Anwen and Baiyun brigades, allowing everyone to carry out a great airing of views, a great debate, and write big-character posters. The natural conditions of Anwen and Baiyun brigades are not much different, but the production situation is very different: the wheat field management of Anwen brigade is meticulously carved, and the wheat seedlings are strong and lush; the wheat field management of Baiyun brigade is extensive, and there are many third-class seedlings. After a heated airing of views and debate, everyone said that the main reason why the spring flowers of Anwen brigade grew well was that their cadres had a thorough work style, could consult with the masses on matters, and had sufficient enthusiasm; the main reason why the spring flowers of Baiyun brigade grew poorly was that the cadres had an unthorough work style, did not consult with the masses on matters, and did not have sufficient enthusiasm. After this comparative debate, the education for all cadres was very profound, and they all made self-examinations in light of their own work styles.

Decisive Action, Doing What Is Said

Comrade Li Shixiang rarely sits in the office. One day in mid-May, he was processing documents in the office. However, he had just sat down when the phone rang. Commune Director Comrade Chen Guang called from Shenze Brigade to tell him that the direct-seeded rice could be transplanted (meaning removing seedlings to fill gaps), but the cadres and the masses did not understand, so the work could not be carried out. A quarter of an hour later, Chen Yuanfang, the general branch secretary of Shenze Brigade, also called to tell him that the direct-seeded rice was still very small, and it was too early to transplant. How strange! The same thing, but the opinions reflected by the two people were different. Whose words should he listen to?

When problems arose in his work, he could not sit still in the office, so he rushed to Shenze Brigade by bicycle. When he arrived at Shenze, he went to the fields to check the growth of the direct-seeded rice and widely solicited the opinions of the commune members, and quickly made a judgment: the direct-seeded rice was indeed still small, and the transplanting work should be postponed. The opinion reflected by the general branch secretary was correct.

On another occasion, he was attending a cadre conference in the county. During the conference, the county Party committee discovered that some communes had cut the grass seeds too early, which affected the yield of grass seeds, so it instructed all communes in a telephone conference to pay attention to this issue and not to cut them too early. After listening to the instructions of the county Party committee, he quickly contacted the commune by phone and asked the comrades who remained in the commune to resolutely implement the instructions of the county Party committee. However, the comrades who remained in the commune told him that because the grass seeds here were planted early and cultivated quickly, and the seeds were good, they could generally be harvested, and 40% of the grass seeds had already been cut. When he learned of this news, he felt very uneasy, fearing that he had violated the instructions of the county Party committee, but because he had been away from the commune for a long time, he did not understand the growth of the grass seeds, and it was difficult to make a correct judgment. Therefore, he immediately sent Comrade Wu Bei, a cadre from Anwen Brigade, back to understand the actual situation and solicit the opinions of the commune members. When Comrade Wu Bei returned and told him that the grass seeds could indeed be harvested, he immediately made a decision and told the comrades who remained in the commune to quickly mobilize women and others to rush to harvest the grass seeds in order to appropriately advance the rice transplanting time.

Carefully Dissecting the "Sparrow"

Whenever a new task begins, or when he is unsure about a certain issue, Comrade Li Shixiang, in addition to holding forums with old farmers as usual, always habitually goes deep into a production team to carefully understand the situation of a small team, find experience from it, and guide the work of the entire commune.

Just as rice transplanting was not yet over, the tasks of weeding and fertilizing and rushing to harvest spring flowers were squeezed together. At this time, many cadres and commune members said that there was a shortage of labor, saying that if they wanted to complete the three major tasks of harvesting, planting, and managing, they would not have enough time even if they worked day and night. Was this really the case? Li Shixiang was very doubtful, but he could not figure out exactly what was going on. In order to solve this urgent problem, he went to the third production team of Hetang Production Team to hold a forum with commune members, specializing in studying the labor issue.

At first, the commune members of this small team also said that there was not enough labor. Later, Comrade Li Shixiang asked everyone to discuss three questions, and the true situation was quickly exposed. The three questions were: Have all the people who can work gone to work? Have the people who have gone to work done their best to start early and return late? Is there a labor quota, and is the labor efficiency of the commune members high? After discussion, it was found that the situation was not entirely like this.

After figuring out the details of a small team, he had a clear understanding in his mind, knowing that the current agricultural work was indeed tight, but the potential of the labor force was still very large. The key issue was to rationally arrange labor, formulate labor quotas, resolutely implement the principle of distribution according to work, mobilize the enthusiasm of commune members, and improve labor efficiency. Therefore, he and the brigade cadres helped the small team establish a responsibility system of contracting work in small sections and setting quotas to individuals, and formulated quota standards for various agricultural tasks. And they carried out division of labor and specialization according to labor strength and technical expertise, so that all the commune members who could work went to work, and everyone was useful. After the experience of this small team was promoted in the entire commune according to local conditions, the labor enthusiasm of the commune members quickly increased, and the labor shortage greatly improved. The three major tasks of harvesting, planting, and managing were completed quickly and well.

Under his influence, most cadres above the brigade level in the entire commune have learned this working method of "dissecting the sparrow," so they have a clear understanding of every task, and their work style is relatively thorough. (Attached pictures)

Comrade Li Shixiang, the Party Secretary of Anwen Commune in Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, is a cadre who goes to the fields all year round, and is praised by the masses.

He is very strict with his work and himself. When he finds shortcomings in his work, he immediately holds a meeting to solve them. At the meeting, he first makes a self-criticism, and also guides everyone to conduct discussions to find solutions.

Whenever he receives a report of a problem occurring in the team, he immediately goes to the scene to check.

Whenever a new task begins, he always habitually goes deep into a small team, finds experience, and promotes it comprehensively.

    干部的良友  群众的知己
    ——记东阳县安文公社党委书记李世祥
    吴有德文　肖林画
    生活在群众之间
    浙江省东阳县安文公社的党委书记李世祥同志，是干部的良友，也是群众的知己。他不仅熟悉每个生产队的自然条件和政治、经济状况，在他进行重点帮助的深泽大队，他甚至能够叫出所有小队长以上干部和社员积极分子的名字，并且已经摸透了他们的脾气，了解了他们的个性，知道了他们的爱好与要求，成了他们最知心的朋友。
    就拿深泽生产队的两个主要干部来说吧。分支书记陈承职同志工作老练、虚心，就是思想有点保守，对于先进的事物不够热情；生产队长陈承达同志工作开始时劲头蛮大，可是碰到困难时往往会动摇，常常是虎头蛇尾。李世祥同志到这个队工作时，总是表扬陈承职同志老练和虚心的一面，指出他的缺点；对于陈承达总是鼓励他的干劲，提醒他不要被困难吓倒，帮助他治好“虎头蛇尾”的毛病。由于经常这样作的结果，这两个人的优点发扬了，缺点也逐渐克服了。现在他两人都把李世祥同志看作是良师益友。
    他和干部相处得融洽无间，社员们也把他当成知心朋友。他不论走到那里，总有许多社员主动找他谈心。有的是向他陈述自己的希望，有的是向他诉说自己的困难，还有的是向他反映生产中的问题和干部作风。依靠这些社员主动反映情况，帮助他避免了工作中的主观主义。去年冬种的时候，深泽生产队社员陈光富主动找他谈心，说有些社员对于小麦播种量每亩一律要三十斤，思想有些不通，怕种了收不好。他觉得这个情况很重要，马上召集有意见的社员开座谈会，进一步听取他们的意见。从座谈中，他知道了1957年的小麦播种量是每亩八斤，现在一律要提高到三十斤，难怪群众有顾虑。于是他在和干部商量之后，就改变了原来的规定，除了部分试验田仍旧坚持每亩播种三十斤以外，其余的可以根据土质、品种等不同情况确定播种量，不强求一律，但是必须做到适当密植，不能恢复每亩八斤种子的做法。从今年的实践结果来看，如果不听群众的话，不分具体情况，一律要求播种三十斤，就会受到不应有的损失。
    有人也许觉得奇怪，李世祥同志怎么会和干部群众处得这样好呢？其实，这也没有什么好奇怪的。因为除了上县开会以外，他是个一年四季脱鞋下田的人，经常和干部社员在一起劳动。无论是兴修水利、插秧或积肥，他总是带头干，而且干得比一般社员的劲头还大。比如在兴修森渥水库的时候，社员一天只能挑土四十担，他却挑了六十五担，社员打夯打了六十下就得休息，他却可以连打二百下。
      对缺点从不放过
    李世祥同志和干部群众上下通气，亲密无间，这是大家都承认的。可是，大家也有一个共同的反映：李世祥同志好严格呀！
    这是怎么一回事呢？原来他在平常和大家总是有说有笑，和和气气的；但是，如果当他发现某个干部有比较重大的缺点，尤其是这种缺点将成为一种倾向的时候，他是相当严格的，从来也不迁就。
    今年2月，他在检查工作的时候，发现有些大队的干部工作作风简单化，有事不和群众商量；也有个别干部作风不踏实。他知道，这种情况虽然是个别的，但是如果不及时加以制止，就可能逐渐蔓延开来，影响当前生产。他和公社党委的同志交换意见之后，就决定用整风的方法，引导大家朝着正确的方向走。
    公社和大队的干部都参加了这次整风会议。在会议中，他自己首先作了检讨，并且摆出了安文和白云两个大队的事实，让大家开展大鸣大放大辩论，写大字报。安文和白云两个大队自然条件差不了多少，可是生产情况相差很大：安文大队麦田管理精雕细刻，大小麦丘丘茁壮，一片墨绿；白云大队麦田管理粗放，三类苗很多。经过热烈的鸣放辩论，大家都说安文大队的春花所以长得好，主要原因是他们的干部工作作风深入，有事能够和群众商量，干劲足；白云大队的春花所以长得差，主要原因是干部工作作风不深入，有事不和群众商量，干劲不足。这样对比辩论之后，给全体干部的教育很深刻，纷纷对照自己的工作作风作了检查。
    当机立断　说干就干
    李世祥同志是极少蹲办公室的。5月中旬的一天，他在办公室处理文件。可是，他刚刚坐下，电话铃响了。社主任陈光同志从深泽大队打电话来，告诉他直播稻已经可以整株（删苗补苗的意思）了，可是干部群众的思想都不通，因此工作搞不开。过了一刻钟，深泽大队的总支书记陈元芳同志也打电话来了，告诉他直播稻还小得很，整株早着呢。多奇怪！同样一件事情，两个人反映的意见不一样，究竟听谁的话好呢？
    工作中出了问题，他在办公室里当然坐不牢了，就急忙骑着车子赶到深泽大队去。到了深泽，他到田间去检查了直播稻的生长情况，又广泛地征求了社员的意见，很快就作出了判断：直播稻确实还小，整株工作应该推迟，总支书记反映的意见是正确的。
    还有一次，他在县里开干部大会，在大会期间，县委因为发现有的公社草子割得过早，影响了草子的产量，就在电话会议上指示各公社注意这个问题，不要割得过早。他听了县委的指示以后，连忙打电话和社里联系，要留社的同志坚决执行县委的指示。可是留社的同志告诉他，因为这里的草子种得早，培育得快，种子又好，已经普遍可以收割，并且有40％的草子已经割掉了。他知道了这个消息，心里非常不安，怕违反了县委的指示，但是因为离开公社久了，对于草子的生长情况不了解，又很难作出正确的判断。于是，他马上派了安文大队的干部吴琲同志回去了解实际情况，征求社员意见。等到吴琲同志回来告诉他草子确实已经可以收割的时候，他立刻下了决心，告诉留社的同志迅速发动妇女等突击抢收草子，以便适当提早插秧时间。
      认真解剖“麻雀”
    每当一件新的工作开始的时候，或者对于某一个问题心中无数的时候，李世祥同志除了照例要开老农座谈会以外，总是习惯地深入到一个生产小队里去，认真摸清一个小队的情况，从中找出经验，指导全公社的工作。
    正当插秧还未结束，耘田施肥和抢收春花的任务又挤在一块了。这时不少干部和社员都叫缺少劳动力，说什么要想收、种、管三大任务一齐完成，白天晚上都干也来不及。事实果真是这样吗？李世祥很怀疑，可是他也弄不清究竟。为了解决这个迫切的问题，他就到荷塘生产队第三生产小队去开社员座谈会，专门研究劳动力问题。
    起初，这个小队的社员也说劳动力不够用。后来，李世祥同志出了三个题目让大家讨论，真实情况就很快暴露出来了。这三个题目是：能够出勤的人是不是全部出勤了？已经出勤的人有没有做到早出晚归？有没有劳动定额、社员的劳动效率高不高？经过讨论后，才知道情况并不完全是这样。
    摸清了一个小队的底细以后，他心中有数了，知道当前的农事确实很紧，但是劳动力的潜力还是很大的，关键问题在于合理安排劳力，制订劳动定额，坚决执行按劳分配的原则，调动社员积极性，提高劳动效率。于是他就和大队干部一起帮助小队建立了小段包工、定额到人的责任制度，制订了各项农活的定额标准。并且根据劳力强弱和技术特长进行分工分业，使能够出勤的社员统统出勤，个个管用。这个小队的经验在全公社因队制宜推广以后，社员的劳动积极性很快提高了，劳动力的紧张状况大为好转。收、种、管三大任务都完成得又快又好。
    在他的影响下，全社大多数大队以上干部都学会了这种“剥麻雀”的工作方法，因而对于每一项工作都作到心中有数，工作作风也比较深入了。（附图片）
    浙江省东阳县安文公社党委书记李世祥同志，是一年四季都下田的干部，受到群众称赞。
    他对待工作和自己，都很严格。当他发现工作中的缺点时，就立即开会解决。会上，他自己先作检讨，也引导大家进行讨论，找出解决的办法。
    每当接到队里发生问题的汇报，他就马上到现场检查。
    一项新的工作开始时，他总是习惯于深入到一个小队，找出经验，全面推广。
