Cultivating Communist New People
I. Spiridonov, First Secretary of the Leningrad Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

The Soviet state has entered a new stage of development—the period of comprehensively building a communist society. One of the most important tasks of this period is to establish the material and technical foundation of communism. However, while establishing the material and technical foundation for the transition to communism, it is essential to ensure that all citizens of society have a high level of consciousness.

N.S. Khrushchev said in his report to the 21st Congress of the CPSU: "In order to reach communism, to reach the most rational and perfect society (at that time, all the best moral qualities of every free person will be fully expressed), we must now cultivate the people of the future."

The ideological foundation of communist education is Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, the Leningrad Party organization always pays attention to educating the working people with the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism, and to educating them to closely combine theoretical research with production practice of various kinds.

In the practice of propaganda work, on the one hand, we study the great legacy of the classic Marxist-Leninist writers and the heroic history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. At the same time, we always adhere to in-depth study of the resolutions of the successive congresses and plenary sessions of the CPSU and the speeches of the party and government leaders, because these resolutions and speeches embody the collective wisdom of the Party and its Leninist Central Committee, and embody the creative development of the important principles of Marxism-Leninism.

Communists and non-Party members are studying the resolutions and documents of the 21st Congress of the CPSU with great interest. Because, at present, anyone who wants to understand what communism is and clarify the road to building communism, in addition to studying the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, should also deeply study the various documents of the 21st Congress.

This academic year, the education network of the Party organizations in Leningrad Oblast and Leningrad City has more than 500,000 students, while last year there were only 310,000. For example, all employees of the Leningrad Machine Tool Factory are studying the historic documents of the Congress. The number of theoretical study seminars organized by the Dzerzhinsky District of Leningrad for intellectuals has increased by half. A network of study groups has been widely established in the areas where the working people live.

Many Party and Youth League organizations hold meetings to discuss the theoretical issues raised by the Congress. Not long ago, the "Proletarian Victory" First Factory held a public meeting of the Youth League entitled "Friends, Let's Look at the Future." At this meeting, there was a lively discussion on how the entire factory could complete the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan, cultivate the people of the future, how to live and work in a communist way, and the obligations of every Soviet person.

The lecture is a particularly widely used form of propaganda. In February and March 1959 alone, as many as 30,000 lectures and reports were held on important current issues related to Marxist-Leninist theory. The speakers included representatives of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, leaders of Party, Soviet and economic organizations, scientists, and literary and art activists.

In addition, the method of organizing lectures and reports directly at production units—in factory workshops, work teams, and collective farms—at a unified time was also adopted. The Ruzh District Party Committee held ninety-three lectures on different topics on the same day. In February and March this year, the Leningrad rapporteur collective went to various enterprises throughout the city to give more than 400 reports. More than 3,500 people participated in the lectures, including well-known scientists, lecturers, scientific research institute staff, and Party workers.

Theoretical conferences on studying Marxist-Leninist theory and practical problems are very popular among the working people. These conferences enable participants to deeply understand the important principles of Marxism-Leninism and creatively apply them in their own practice. The theoretical conference held in the Kuibyshev District of Leningrad attracted many people, and the topic of discussion was "The Seven-Year Plan is the Most Important Stage in Solving the Basic Economic Tasks of the Soviet Union." The conference held in the Zhdanov District of Leningrad with the theme "The Tasks of Industrial Enterprise Employees in Implementing the Resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU" and the conference held in the Leningrad Metal Factory entitled "The Seven-Year Plan is a Magnificent Program for Comprehensively Building Communism" were both fascinating. Researchers at Leningrad University discussed "The Role of Science in Building a Communist Society" at a theoretical conference.

Party organizations widely use the effective forms of mass political work from the past and the new forms that have emerged in the life and creative work of Party organizations. One of these new forms is the "Lenin Lecture," which is held in cultural centers, clubs, memorial halls, or directly in enterprises. For example, the Leningrad Branch of the Lenin Central Memorial Hall held a routine lecture on March 22. Associate Professor Mishalin gave a report at this lecture entitled "Lenin's Theory of Socialist Revolution and its Further Development at the 20th and 21st Congresses of the CPSU." After the report, an old Communist Party member, Foggieva, who had worked with Lenin, introduced the activities of the great leader in his later years.

Another new form of propaganda is the "Sunday Lecture." This lecture is held every Sunday in cultural centers, workers' clubs, collective farm clubs, and youth dormitories. The speakers include leading cadres of the Party, Soviet and economic organizations, skilled speakers, old Bolsheviks, veteran workers, and literary and art workers. This makes it possible for propaganda work to penetrate the broad masses, penetrate all strata of the working people and their families, and in many large settlements and some collective farms and state farms throughout the state, there are approximately more than eighty social speaking organizations. The Leningrad Oblast Committee of the CPSU often sends propaganda teams to work in rural areas, which greatly helps the local Party organizations to explain the policies of the Communist Party and strengthen mass political work. In addition to Party workers and reporters, old Bolsheviks, veteran workers, writers, artists, cultural and educational workers, agricultural experts, and amateur art workers also participate in the propaganda teams.

The Party organization educates Soviet people with communist morality, and often holds reports on moral issues for the working people, and organizes debates and theoretical discussions. Materials on modeling art, film, music and drama are often published in newspapers. Many enterprises produce satirical wall newspapers and organize exhibitions entitled "This is Not Allowed." The content of the exhibition mainly opposes the behavior of individual people that does not conform to communist morality and communist spirit. Recently, the cultural universities held in cultural centers, clubs, memorial halls, enterprises and dormitories have been very popular among the working people. Cultural universities hold classes in the evening, and the courses mainly include Marxist-Leninist aesthetics, literature and art (music, fine arts, etc.).

The cultural university is an amateur social organization, and its leaders, such as the president, department head, and teaching and research office director, are elected. Giving lectures and reports at the cultural university is also a social work. Therefore, studying at this university does not cost a penny.

By mid-April, there were nineteen cultural universities in Leningrad, each with a capacity of five hundred to eight hundred people. This form of cultural education is a good form. The number of people willing to enroll, especially young people, is gradually increasing. Therefore, the number of cultural universities is also constantly increasing. Cultural universities not only help young people enrich their knowledge, but also educate young men and women to become comprehensively developed communist builders with excellent moral qualities and aesthetic cultivation.

The cultural centers and cultural palaces in Leningrad also have "Friends Clubs," "Travelers Clubs," "Stamp Collecting Clubs," "Music Lovers Clubs," "Nature Lovers Clubs," "Girls Clubs," and other organizations. These cultural and educational organizations play a significant role in educating young people due to their diverse forms and themes of work. The Petergler District Club in Leningrad has done a lot of meaningful work. The club's international department maintains contact with sixty-seven countries, often organizes symposiums to discuss the lives of working people in foreign countries, and also organizes young people to meet with students from people's democratic countries studying in various universities in Leningrad.

Folk amateur theater troupes have appeared in many districts. These theater troupes, as well as folk choirs, song and dance troupes, etc., can promote the participation of working people in artistic activities, thereby improving their cultural level.

In the struggle against the remnants of the old society in the minds of some Soviet people, social organizations and groups are playing an increasingly important role. The methods of workers' congresses, comrades' trial meetings, and people's pickets maintaining social order are now widely used to carry out this struggle. The method of "stand in the middle," that is, all the workers gather in the center of the workshop to analyze the phenomenon of being late for work, being irresponsible in work, and being rude to comrades, has a great educational effect on backward workers.

The struggle against bourgeois ideology and modern revisionism, educating the working people to raise their political vigilance and hate the enemies of communism, these currently occupy an important position in the Party organization's ideological work.

Labor education is the center of the Party's ideological work. Socialist competition plays a great role in this regard. In the first few five-year plans and the post-war period, millions of Soviet people received good labor training in the test of socialist competition. Now, when the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU have aroused a new upsurge of labor people striving to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, due to the creative power of the people, a new patriotic movement has been launched throughout the country to strive for the title of "Communist Labor Collective" and "Shock Worker."

In Leningrad, more than 3,000 units are participating in this movement. Among them, twenty-seven units have won the glorious and proud title of "Communist Labor Team" in the first quarter of this year. The slogan of the "Communist Labor Team" and "Shock Worker" is "Work, study and live in a communist way."

Scientists and students in institutions of higher learning have given active assistance to the units striving to obtain the title of "Communist Labor Collective." They often go to the workshops of enterprises and the livestock farms and fields of collective farms to help workers and collective farmers improve labor productivity, help them put forward rationalization proposals and carry out creative inventions, and help them obtain secondary and higher education without leaving production. Young students go to collective farms and reclamation areas to help harvest crops, assist in soil improvement and construction work.

The Party organization often educates young people with the glorious revolutionary traditions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the working class. There are many factories in Leningrad with more than 100 years of history. In celebrating the anniversary of these factories and congratulating the old workers, the young people are also educated to respect the honor of their enterprises and collectives. The work of compiling factory history has been widely carried out. In recent years, the history of the Kirov Factory (formerly the Putilov Factory), the Izher Power Factory, the "Faster" Factory and other enterprises has been prepared for publication.

In order to carry forward the glorious tradition of labor, conferences commemorating significant days in the history of socialist competition are often held. For example, the workers of Leningrad have widely launched activities to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Soviet socialist competition. In many factories, enthusiastic workers, with the active help of the older generation of workers, established factory history rooms and labor glory memorial halls. Clubs and cultural centers often hold evenings with the participation of revolutionary predecessors, with many names, such as: "Maintain the Honor of Our Factory," "Unforgettable Glorious Days," and "Our Trademark," and so on.

Many enterprises have established old workers' committees to educate young people with the glorious traditions of the proletariat. For example, the old workers of the Izher Power Factory, who have dedicated their decades of life to labor production and have now retired, often go to the workshops and departments of the factory, to the youth dormitories, and have cordial conversations with young people about labor and life issues.

The Party organizations at all levels in Leningrad City and Leningrad Oblast educate the working people with the purpose of collectivism, love of labor, cultivating the spirit of socialist internationalism and patriotism, and the highest standards of communist social morality, in order to smoothly complete the tasks of further improving industrial and agricultural production proposed to Leningrad City and Leningrad Oblast in the Seven-Year Plan.

    培养共产主义新人
    苏联共产党列宁格勒州委第一书记　伊·斯皮里东诺夫
    苏维埃国家已经进入了新的发展时期——全面开展共产主义社会建设的时期。这个时期最主要的任务之一，就是建立共产主义的物质技术基础。但是在建立向共产主义过渡的物质技术基础的同时，必需使社会全体公民具有高度的觉悟水平。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在苏共第二十一次代表大会的报告中说：“为了到达共产主义，到达最合理和最完善的社会（那时候，每个自由的人的一切最优秀的道德品质都将完全表现出来），我们现在就必需培养将来的人。”
    共产主义教育的思想基础就是马克思列宁主义。因此，列宁格勒的党组织经常注意用马克思列宁主义不朽的思想教育劳动人民。教育他们要把理论研究和各个不同性质的生产实践紧密地结合起来。
    在宣传工作的实践中，一方面是研究马克思列宁主义经典作家的伟大遗产和苏联共产党的英雄历史，同时也始终坚持深入研究苏共历届代表大会和中央全会的决议以及党政领导同志们的言论，因为这些决议和言论中体现了党及其列宁式的中央委员会的集体智慧，体现了对马克思列宁主义重要原理的创造性发展。
    共产党人和非党人士正以极大的兴趣研究苏共二十一次代表大会的决议和文件。因为，目前凡是要了解什么是共产主义和明确建成共产主义的道路的人，除了学习马克思列宁主义经典著作外，还应该深入研究二十一次代表大会的各项文件。
    本学年，列宁格勒州和列宁格勒市党组织的教育网拥有五十多万名学员，而去年只有三十一万名。例如，列宁格勒机床厂的全体职工都在学习代表大会的历史性文件。列宁格勒捷尔任斯基区为知识分子组织的理论性学习讨论会的次数增加了一倍半。在劳动人民居住的地区广泛建立起学习小组网。
    许多党、团组织都召开会议，讨论代表大会提出的理论问题。不久以前，“无产阶级胜利”第一工厂举行了一次以“朋友们，让我们看看未来”为题的共青团公开会议。在这次会议上畅谈了关于工厂全体人员如何完成七年计划的任务、培养未来的人以及怎样按照共产主义方式生活和劳动，以及每个苏维埃人的义务等问题。
    演讲会这种宣传方式采用得特别广泛。仅1959年2—3月间，关于马克思列宁主义理论有关当前重要问题的演讲会和报告会就举行了三万次之多。作报告的人有苏共二十一次代表大会的代表，党、苏维埃和经济组织的领导工作者、科学家和文学艺术活动家。
    此外，还采用了在统一的时间直接在生产单位——在工厂的车间、工作队和在集体农庄里组织讲座和报告会的办法。鲁日区党委在同一天内就举办了不同题目的九十三次演讲会。在今年2月和3月两个月内，列宁格勒的报告员集体出动到全市各企业作报告达四百余次。参加演讲的有著名的科学家、讲师、科学研究所的工作人员和党的工作者等三千五百人之多。
    研究马克思列宁主义理论和现实问题的理论会议在劳动人民中非常流行。这种会议可使参加者深入地理解马克思列宁主义的重要原理，并在自己实践中创造性地加以运用。列宁格勒古比雪夫区举办的理论会议吸引了很多人，讨论的题目是“七年计划是解决苏联基本经济任务的最重要的阶段”。列宁格勒日丹诺夫区举办的以“工业企业职工在执行苏共第二十一次代表大会决议中的任务”为题的会议和列宁格勒金属工厂举行的题为“七年计划是全面开展共产主义建设的宏伟纲领”的会议都是引人入胜的。列宁格勒大学的科学研究员在理论会议上讨论了“科学在建设共产主义社会中所起的作用”。
    党组织广泛地运用了过去行之有效的以及在党组织的生活和创造性工作中产生的新的群众政治工作的形式。这些新的形式之一就是“列宁演讲会”，这种演讲会在文化馆、俱乐部、纪念馆或直接在企业里举行。例如，列宁中央纪念馆列宁格勒分馆在3月22日举办了一次例行的演讲会。副教授米沙林在这次演讲会上作了题为“列宁的社会主义革命理论及其在苏共二十次和二十一次代表大会上的进一步发展”的报告。报告后，一位曾经和列宁在一起工作过的老共产党员福吉耶娃在会上介绍了伟大领袖后期的活动。
    另外一种新的宣传形式是“星期日演讲会”。这种演讲会是每当星期天在文化馆、工人俱乐部、集体农庄俱乐部和青年宿舍里举行的。演讲人有党、苏维埃和经济组织的领导干部、熟练的演讲家、老布尔什维克、老工人和文学艺术工作者。这样可以使宣传工作深入广大群众，深入各阶层劳动人民及其家属中间去，在全州很多大的居民点和一些集体农庄、国营农场里，社会讲演组织大约有八十多个。苏共列宁格勒州委经常派宣传小组到农村工作，这对当地党组织解释共产党的政策以及加强群众政治工作有很大的帮助。参加宣传小组的除了党的工作者、报告员之外，还有老布尔什维克、老工人、作家、艺术家、文教工作者、农业专家和业余艺术工作者。
    党组织以共产主义道德教育苏维埃人，经常为劳动人民举行道德问题的报告，组织辩论和理论性的讨论会。在报纸上，经常刊登有关造型艺术、电影、音乐和戏剧问题的材料。很多企业里都出讽刺性的墙报，组织名为“不容许这样做”的展览。展览的内容主要是反对个别人的不符合共产主义道德和共产主义精神的行为。最近一个时期在文化馆、俱乐部、纪念馆、企业和宿舍里所举办的文化大学很受劳动人民的欢迎。文化大学都在晚间上课，课程主要是马克思列宁主义的美学、文学和艺术（音乐、美术等等）。
    文化大学是一种业余社会组织，它的领导人员，如校长、系主任、教研室主任等都是由选举产生的。在文化大学里讲课和做报告也是一种社会工作。因此，在这种大学里学习，不需花费一个钱。
    到4月中旬为止，列宁格勒已有十九所文化大学，每所学校能容纳五百人到八百人。这种文化教育的形式是一种很好的形式。愿意入学的人，特别是青年在逐渐增多。因此，文化大学的数目也在不断增加。文化大学不仅帮助青年们丰富知识，而且还教育男女青年成为一个具有优秀道德品质和美学修养的全面发展的共产主义建设者。
    列宁格勒各文化馆和文化宫还设有“朋友俱乐部”、“旅行家俱乐部”、“集邮俱乐部”、“音乐爱好者俱乐部”、“自然爱好者俱乐部”、“姑娘俱乐部”以及其他组织。这些文化教育的组织由于工作的形式和题材多种多样，所以在教育青年中占着显著的地位。列宁格勒彼得格勒区俱乐部进行了很多有意义的工作。俱乐部的国际部和六十七个国家保持联系，经常组织座谈会讨论有关外国劳动人民的生活等问题，还组织青年同在列宁格勒各高等学校学习的人民民主国家留学生会面。
    在很多区里出现了民间业余剧团。这些剧团以及民间合唱团、歌舞团等都能促进劳动人民参加艺术活动，从而提高他们的文化水平。
    在和一部分苏维埃人意识中的旧社会残余进行的斗争中，社会组织和团体日益起着重要的作用。现在广泛采用工人大会、同志审判会和维护社会秩序的人民纠察队等方式进行这个斗争。像“站到中间来”的方式，即在车间里，全体工人聚集在车间的中央，分析上工迟到、工作不负责任以及对同志态度粗暴等现象，这种方式对落后的工人有很大的教育作用。
    同资产阶级思想和现代修正主义作斗争，教育劳动人民提高政治警惕性、仇视共产主义的敌人，这些目前在党组织的思想工作中占着重要的地位。
    劳动教育是党的思想工作的中心。社会主义竞赛在这方面起着很大的作用。在最初几个五年计划和战后时期，千百万苏维埃人在社会主义竞赛的考验中受到了良好的劳动锻炼。现在，当苏共二十一次代表大会的决议激起了劳动人民争取提前完成七年计划的新的竞赛高潮的时候，由于人民的创造力量在全国掀起了一个争取“共产主义劳动集体”和“突击手”称号的新的爱国主义运动。
    在列宁格勒，参加这个运动的有三千多个单位。其中二十七个单位在今年第一季度已获得了“共产主义劳动队”这个光荣而值得自豪的称号。“共产主义劳动队”和“突击手”的口号是“按照共产主义的方式工作、学习和生活”。
    高等学校的科学家和学生对为获得“共产主义劳动集体”称号而奋斗的单位给予了积极的帮助。他们经常到企业的车间和集体农庄的畜牧场和田间去，帮助工人和集体农民提高劳动生产率，帮助他们提出合理化建议和进行创造发明，帮助他们在不脱产的情况下获得中等和高等教育。青年学生们到集体农庄和垦荒地上去帮助收割庄稼，协助进行土壤改良和修建工作。
    党组织经常用苏联共产党和工人阶级的光荣革命传统教育青年。在列宁格勒有不少具有一百年以上历史的工厂。在庆祝这些工厂的周年纪念和祝贺老工人的当中，也就教育了青年人尊重自己的企业和集体的荣誉。编写工厂史的工作已经广泛地开展起来。最近几年内，准备出版基洛夫工厂（原为普提洛夫工厂）、伊热尔电力工厂、“快速者”工厂和其他一些企业的历史。
    为了发扬劳动的光荣传统，经常举行纪念社会主义竞赛历史中有意义的日子的大会。譬如，列宁格勒的工人们广泛地展开了苏联社会主义竞赛三十周年的纪念活动。很多工厂里，热情的工人们在老一代工人的积极帮助下成立了厂史室、劳动光荣纪念馆。俱乐部和文化馆经常举行有革命前辈参加的晚会，它的名目很多，如：“保持我们工厂的荣誉”、“不可磨灭的光荣日子”以及“我们的商标”等等。
    许多企业成立了老工人委员会，以无产阶级光荣传统教育青年。例如，把自己几十年的生命都献给了劳动生产、现在已经退休的伊热尔电力工厂的老工人，还经常到工厂的车间和科室，到青年宿舍去，和青年们亲切地进行有关劳动和生活问题的交谈。
    列宁格勒市和列宁格勒州各级党组织以集体主义、热爱劳动、培养社会主义国际主义和爱国主义精神，以及共产主义社会道德的最高准则等教育劳动人民的目的，是为了顺利地完成七年计划中向列宁格勒市和列宁格勒州所提出的进一步提高工农业生产的任务。
