Many industrial and mining enterprises, construction enterprises, transportation enterprises, and commercial enterprises are striving for high output and high quality while strengthening economic accounting, practicing strict economy, and reducing costs, in order to complete national plans in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

Economy is one of the basic principles of managing a socialist economy and an important source of socialist accumulation. Every socialist enterprise has two main tasks. One main task is to increase the quantity of products, improve the quality of products, and expand the variety and design of products (for construction enterprises, it is to accelerate project progress and improve project quality; for transportation enterprises, it is to increase transportation volume and improve transportation quality; for commercial enterprises, it is to increase the purchase and sales volume of goods and improve service quality), in order to maximize the needs of national construction, social production, and people's lives under the arrangement of the unified national plan. The other main task is to rationally and economically use all resources, strive to reduce costs, ensure production profits, and increase accumulation for the country. These two different tasks, although they are interconnected and mutually influential, cannot replace each other. Our requirement is that products must be numerous, quality must be good, costs must be low, and there must be accumulation. The idea that "saving is a trivial matter, why bother so much, just produce more, and everything will be there" is incorrect. Increasing production is of course very important, but if costs are not calculated and strict economy is not practiced, increased production may not fulfill the cost plan. It is not unheard of for a company to complete the product quantity plan well and increase output value a lot, but still lose money. Some people often see losses as merely losing some "money" and profits as merely earning some "money," without understanding that money is a symbol of things. The so-called production cost includes the consumption of living labor and materialized labor (material means). Living labor also needs to eat and wear clothes, and also consumes material means. What does losing money mean? Losing money means that the material means produced are not enough to offset the material means consumed in production. If such production increases, the material wealth (material means) controlled by the country will not only not increase, but will decrease. What does profit mean? Profit means that the material means produced are more than the material means consumed in production, so that the material wealth controlled by the country continues to increase, that is, accumulation continues to increase. This is a necessary condition for expanded reproduction. And continuously expanding social reproduction is the prerequisite for transforming our country from "poor and blank" into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Therefore, strengthening economic accounting and practicing strict economy is not only a major economic issue, but also a major political issue.

Of course, when a factory has just been put into production, or a new product is being trial-produced, it is unavoidable that more money is spent and costs are higher due to lack of experience, and there is no profit, or even some money is lost. No matter what undertaking is started, the price paid is always higher in the initial stage, from scratch, which is a common rule. However, after we have paid the price and learned from experience, we can no longer lose money. Even in the initial stage of starting and exploring experience, we must be careful and try to spend less money, and we must never be extravagant like a rich young master. Therefore, no matter when, we must practice strict economy, and we cannot regard economy and cost reduction as dispensable. We must remember Chairman Mao's words: "Any socialist economic undertaking must pay attention to making the fullest possible use of manpower and equipment, improving labor organization, improving business management, and increasing labor productivity, saving all possible manpower and material resources, carrying out labor competitions and economic accounting, in order to reduce costs year by year, increase personal income, and increase accumulation." ("Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" page 768)

In the past ten years, the operation and management of industrial enterprises, construction enterprises, transportation enterprises, and commercial enterprises in our country have been continuously improving. Our product output has increased greatly every year, product quality and labor productivity have improved every year, and costs have decreased every year. However, there are also some enterprises that have not paid enough attention to operation and management work in the recent period, so the consumption quotas for raw materials and management expenses have not yet reached the prescribed targets, and the costs of some products have not met the prescribed requirements. Therefore, there is still great potential for reducing product costs in these enterprises. Another situation is that we developed many small and medium-sized enterprises last year. Due to poor technical foundations and insufficient management experience, many enterprises have some unreasonable aspects in the use of raw materials and the organization of labor. Since the beginning of this year, the production costs of these enterprises have generally been decreasing month by month, and many of them are profitable, but there are also some enterprises whose material wealth produced cannot offset the consumption of raw materials, materials, and fuels. Since some units with relatively simple equipment and shorter production time have low costs and are profitable, while other units have high costs and are not profitable, this shows that there is great potential for saving. Even those original large and medium-sized enterprises whose production technology and operation and management work have improved compared with the past, still have potential to tap in terms of saving raw materials, saving management expenses, and improving labor productivity. Therefore, every department and every enterprise should rely on the masses of workers and further improve operation and management, practice strict economy, and not only achieve high output and high quality, but also continuously reduce costs in the increase production and practice economy movement.

Practicing strict economy and reducing costs is part of the entire production activity. Savings can be made in every link of the entire production process. For example, if product design and engineering design are reasonable, there will be savings; if the design is unreasonable, there will be waste. If equipment is well maintained, there will be savings; if it is not well maintained, there will be waste. If raw materials, materials, and fuels are used reasonably, there will be savings; if they are used unreasonably, there will be waste. If labor organization is reasonable, there will be savings; if it is unreasonable, there will be waste. Whether the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is carried out well and whether labor efficiency is high also have a great impact on the level of costs. Here, the decisive factor is people, whether all the workers participating in production activities have established the idea of "saving." Therefore, to practice strict economy and reduce costs, we must educate all workers in building the country diligently and thriftily and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, so that everyone understands the political significance of practicing strict economy, everyone cares about production costs, and everyone consciously opposes waste and practices strict economy.

However, having the desire and determination to practice strict economy and reduce costs is not enough, and there must be effective methods. What are the effective methods to achieve the goal of practicing strict economy and reducing costs? It is economic accounting. Economic accounting is to use currency to measure the consumption and results of an enterprise's economic activities. To put it simply, economic accounting is accounting, calculating the consumption of raw materials, materials, fuels, and tools, machine depreciation, equipment maintenance, wages, and all other production expenses, calculating the sales revenue of products, comparing expenses and income, and seeing whether it is making money or losing money. Through the analysis of making money or losing money, we can find out where production is still unreasonable in the production process and where there is still potential for saving. This points out the direction for further improving production and improving operation and management, so that everyone is clear in their minds. Implementing economic accounting in enterprises, workshops, and teams can urge leaders at all levels of the enterprise and all workers to constantly tap the internal potential of the enterprise, find ways to reduce the consumption of raw materials, materials, fuels, tools, and working hours, carry out technical innovation, exert equipment efficiency, improve product quality, and accelerate the turnover of working capital, in order to produce more and better products with less manpower, material resources, and funds. Therefore, economic accounting is not a passive accounting, but a weapon to ensure the rational and economical use of manpower, material resources, and financial resources by enterprises, a weapon to promote the development of technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and to ensure that enterprises continuously improve labor efficiency and complete national plans in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. We must master and use this weapon well.

In order to do a good job in economic accounting, we must strengthen quota management and improve necessary rules and regulations. Quotas are the criteria for measuring the work performance of workers and the basis for economic accounting. Every enterprise should have unified working hour consumption quotas, and unified consumption quotas for raw materials, materials, fuels, and tools. Unified quotas are formulated based on equipment conditions, worker technical levels, and specific product requirements. Quotas must be advanced and achievable and surpassable by the masses of workers through hard work, in order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses of workers. The so-called strengthening of quota management is to rely on the masses of workers to formulate new reasonable quotas, revise old unreasonable quotas, and then arrange production according to unified quotas. This is the first step in doing a good job in economic accounting.

The role of rules and regulations is to guide people to act in accordance with certain norms, which is necessary for orderly organization of production and also necessary for implementing economic accounting. In accordance with the requirements of economic accounting, in addition to establishing necessary production management and technical management rules and regulations, there should also be cost accounting systems, capital management systems, financial expenditure systems, raw material, material, and tool management systems, material requisition and return systems, original record systems, etc. To implement economic accounting, these systems are necessary, so that they can promote the development of production and also be conducive to saving.

Practicing strict economy and opposing waste is for the purpose of better implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction and accelerating the pace of construction. Therefore, any enterprise must act in accordance with policies when implementing economic accounting. While vigorously saving raw materials, materials, fuels, tools, and working hours, it must ensure product quality, and must not engage in shoddy work and reduce product quality under the guise of saving. While improving equipment utilization rates, it must pay attention to the normal maintenance of equipment. While improving production efficiency, it must pay attention to safety in production, and must not only care about today and not tomorrow. While considering the interests of their own enterprises, they must also consider the overall interests of other enterprises and the national economy. The small must obey the big, and the parts must obey the whole. Only in this way can economic accounting achieve the true goal of more, faster, better, and more economical.

For our many enterprises, many enterprise leaders, and many workers, the experience of economic accounting may not be complete or rich enough, but it is not unfamiliar. Every department and every region has many enterprises, workshops, and teams that have been adhering to economic accounting and have made great achievements. As long as their experience is well summarized and promoted, and other enterprises, workshops, and teams are organized to learn well, we will definitely be able to do a good job in economic accounting and greatly improve the production level and management level of all enterprises.

### 加强经济核算，不断降低成本

    加强经济核算，不断降低成本
    许多工矿企业、建筑企业、交通运输企业和商业企业，正在力争高产优质的同时，加强经济核算，厉行节约，降低成本，以便又多又快又好又省地完成国家计划。
    节约是管理社会主义经济的基本原则之一，也是社会主义积累的重要源泉。每一个社会主义企业都有两个主要任务。一个主要任务是在国家统一计划的安排下，努力增加产品数量，提高产品质量，扩大产品品种和花色（在建筑企业，便是加快工程进度和提高工程质量；在交通运输企业，便是增加运输数量和提高运输质量；在商业企业，便是增加货物收购和销售数量，提高服务质量），以便最大限度地满足国家建设、社会生产和人民生活的需要。另一个主要任务是合理地节约地使用一切资源，努力降低成本，保证生产赢利，给国家增加积累。这两种不同的任务，虽然它们是互相连系、互相影响着的，但不能互相代替。我们的要求是产品要多，质量要好，成本要低，要有积累。“节约是鸡毛蒜皮的事，何必费那样大劲，多生产一些，什么都有了。”这种想法是不正确的。增产当然很重要，但是如果不计算成本，不厉行节约，增产了不一定完成成本计划。产品数量计划完成得好，产值增加得很多，但是企业还要赔钱的事，不是没有的。有些人往往把亏本看成仅仅是赔一些“钱”，把盈利看成仅仅是赚一些“钱”，而不懂得钱是物的符号。所谓生产成本，包括活劳动和物化劳动（物质资料）的消耗。活劳动也要吃饭穿衣，也要消耗物质资料。亏本是什么意思呢？亏本就是生产出来的物质资料还不够抵偿生产中消耗的物质资料。这样的生产多了，国家掌握的物质财富（物质资料）不但增加不了，反而会减少。盈利是什么意思呢？盈利就是生产出来的物质资料，多于生产中消耗的物质资料，使国家所掌握的物质财富不断增加，也就是积累不断增加。这是扩大再生产的必要条件。而不断地扩大社会再生产，是把我国由“一穷二白”变成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国的前提。因此加强经济核算，厉行节约，不仅仅是一个重大的经济问题，也是一个重大的政治问题。
    当然，在一个工厂刚刚投入生产，或者试制一件新产品的时候，由于没有经验，钱花得多一些，成本高一些，不赚钱，甚至还要赔点钱，是难免的。不论创办什么事业，在从无到有，即在开始的阶段，付出的代价总要高一些，这是通常的规律。但是，当我们付了代价，学得了经验以后，就不能再赔钱。就是在开始创办、摸索经验的阶段，我们也要精打细算，力求少花些钱，决不能像阔少爷那样大手大脚的。因此，不论在什么时候，我们都必须厉行节约，都不能把节约和降低成本看作是可有可无的事。我们要好好地记住毛主席的话：“任何社会主义的经济事业，必须注意尽可能充分地利用人力和设备，尽可能改善劳动组织、改善经营管理和提高劳动生产率，节约一切可能节约的人力和物力，实行劳动竞赛和经济核算，借以逐年降低成本，增加个人收入和增加积累。”（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”七六八页）
    近十年来，我国工业企业、建筑企业、交通运输企业和商业企业的经营管理工作在不断地改善着。我们的产品产量每年都有很大增长，产品质量、劳动生产效率每年都有所提高，成本每年都有所降低。但是，也有一些企业在最近一个时期，对于经营管理工作注意得不够，所以原料、材料的消耗定额和管理费用还没有达到规定的指标，有些产品的成本没有达到规定的要求。因此降低产品成本在这些企业还大有可为。还有一个情况，就是我们去年发展了许多中小型企业，由于技术基础较差，管理经验不足，不少企业在原料、材料使用和劳动力组织方面都有一些不大合理的地方。今年以来，这些企业的生产成本，总的趋势是逐月降低的，其中不少企业都有盈利，但也有一些企业生产出来的物质财富，还抵偿不了原料、材料和燃料的消耗。同样是设备比较简单、投入生产的时间比较短的企业，既然有些单位的成本低和有盈利，有的单位却成本高，没有盈利，这就说明节约的潜力很大。就是那些生产技术和经营管理工作都比过去有所提高的原有大中型企业，在节约原料、材料，节约管理费用，提高劳动生产效率等方面，也还有潜力可挖。所以，不论哪一个部门、哪一个企业，在增产节约运动中，都应当依靠职工群众，进一步改善经营管理，厉行节约，既做到高产优质，又能不断地降低成本。
    厉行节约，降低成本，是整个生产活动的一部分。在全部生产过程的各个环节，都可以节约。例如产品设计和工程设计得合理，就节约，设计得不合理，就浪费；设备检修维护得好，就节约，检修维护得不好，就浪费；原料、材料、燃料使用得合理，就节约，使用得不合理，就浪费；劳动组织合理，就节约，不合理，就浪费。技术革新和技术革命运动开展得好不好，劳动效率高不高，对于成本的高低也有很大的影响。在这里，决定的因素是人，是参加生产活动的全体职工是不是树立了“省”的思想。因此，要厉行节约，降低成本，就得对全体职工进行勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的教育，使人人都懂得厉行节约的政治意义，人人都关心生产成本，都自觉地反对浪费，厉行节约。
    但是，光有厉行节约、降低成本的愿望和决心还不行，还必须要有有效的方法。什么是达到厉行节约、降低成本的目的的有效方法呢？是经济核算。经济核算，就是用货币来衡量企业经济活动的消耗和成果。说通俗一点，经济核算，就是算账，算原料、材料、燃料和工具的消耗、机器折旧、设备维修、工资等等一切生产开支的账，算产品销售收入的账，比较开支和收入，看看到底是赚钱还是赔钱。通过对赚钱或者赔钱的分析，就可以发现在生产过程中，什么地方生产还不合理？什么地方还有节约潜力？这就给进一步改进生产，改进经营管理指出方向，使大家心里清清楚楚的。在企业、在车间、在班组实行经济核算，就可以督促企业各级领导人员和全体职工经常挖掘企业内部潜力，设法减少原料、材料、燃料、工具、劳动时间的消耗，开展技术革新，发挥设备效率，提高产品质量，加速流动资金的周转，以便用较少的人力、物力和资金，生产更多更好的产品。所以经济核算，不是消极的算账，而是保证企业合理地节约地使用人力物力和财力的武器，是推动技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，保证企业不断地提高劳动效率，多快好省地完成国家计划的武器。我们必须好好地掌握和运用这个武器。
    为了做好经济核算工作，必须加强定额管理和健全必要的规章制度。定额是衡量职工群众工作成绩的标准，是经济核算的依据。每一个企业，都应当有统一的工时消耗定额，有统一的原料、材料、燃料和工具消耗定额。统一的定额是根据设备状况、工人的技术水平和产品的具体要求制订出来的。定额必须既是先进的，又是职工群众经过努力可以达到和可以超过的，才能充分调动职工群众的积极性。所谓加强定额管理，就是依靠职工群众制订新的合理定额，修改旧的不合理的定额，然后根据统一的定额安排生产。这是做好经济核算的第一步工作。
    规章制度的作用是引导人们按照一定的规范去行动，这是有秩序地组织生产所必需的，也是实行经济核算所必需的。按照经济核算的要求，除了建立必要的生产管理和技术管理的规章制度以外，还要有成本核算制度、资金管理制度、财务开支制度、原料、材料、工具管理制度、领料和退料制度、原始纪录制度等等。要实行经济核算，必须要有这些制度，这样才能促进生产的发展，也才有利于节约。
    厉行节约、反对浪费，为的是更好地贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，加快建设速度。因此，任何企业在实行经济核算的时候，必须按照政策办事。既要大力节约原料、材料、燃料、工具和劳动时间，又要保证产品质量，决不能假借节约之名进行偷工减料，降低产品质量。既要提高设备利用率，又要注意设备的正常保养和维修，既要提高生产效率，又要注意安全生产，决不能只顾今天而不顾明天。既要考虑自己企业的利益，又要考虑其它企业和国民经济的整体利益，小局必须服从大局，部分必须服从整体。只有这样，经济核算才能达到真正的多快好省的目的。
    对于我们的许多企业、许多企业领导人员、许多职工来说，经济核算的经验，可能不够完整，不够丰富，但是并不是生疏的。每一个部门、每一个地区都有很多一直坚持经济核算的企业、车间和班组，并且都做出了很大的成绩。只要把它们的经验好好地总结和推广，组织别的企业、车间、班组好好地学习，我们一定能作好经济核算工作，把所有企业的生产水平和经营管理水平大大提高一步。
