    在开罗庆祝埃及革命七周年大会上
    纳赛尔谈阿联国内外政策
    新华社开罗23日电　阿拉伯联合共和国今天为庆祝埃及革命七周年在开罗举行了阅兵典礼。纳赛尔总统检阅了阿联的武装部队。庆祝活动将举行四天。
    纳赛尔总统22日在埃及革命七周年前夕，在开罗共和国广场举行的庆祝大会上发表了长篇政策演说。谈到对外政策，纳赛尔说：“我们今天一贯的政策仍然是：我们不应当敌视美国、英国、苏联或任何其它国家。”他表示希望同美国和英国建立友好关系，也谈到了同苏联的友谊。
    关于阿拉伯国家之间的关系，纳赛尔再次强调他所主张的“阿拉伯民族主义”。他竭力表白阿联是一贯同伊拉克求团结的，自己并不想“强使人接受他的领导”。他集中攻击伊拉克共产党。他重复所谓阿联、伊拉克和其它阿拉伯国家的共产党人是硬代理人”和“破坏阿拉伯团结”。他说摩苏尔叛乱和最近发生的基尔库克事件都是共产党人引起的。他竭力表示要和伊拉克“互相支援”，并要伊拉克人民反对共产党。
    关于国内情况，纳赛尔谈到阿联唯一的政治组织民族联盟。他说：“肃清试图恢复政党的机会主义者是你们的责任。任何试图恢复政党的人将被认为是卖国贼。”
