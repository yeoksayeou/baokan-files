Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 24th. Henan Province's raw coal production in the ten days of mid-July saw an average daily output increase of 11.3% compared to the first ten days of the month, exceeding the state plan.

Entering mid-July, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly put forward effective measures to increase coal production. Leading cadres of various mining bureaus also went deep into the field, taking charge of specific areas, and personally directing operations, thus greatly inspiring the enthusiasm of workers. Large-scale socialist labor competitions for high yields were launched at all coal mining work faces, and advanced experiences such as blasting coal loading, rapid chute shifting, and four-shift parallel operations were widely promoted, which played a significant role in increasing raw coal production.

While focusing on production, all coal mines also grasped the leadership of production preparation work and universally supplemented and strengthened tunneling forces. In mid-July, the province's average daily tunneling progress reached more than 1,000 meters, an increase of 20.6% compared to the first ten days of July. During this period, all mines also particularly strengthened the inspection and maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment and roadways.

Another dispatch: Since entering the third quarter, the daily output of raw coal has been continuously rising in various mines under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau. The average daily output of the entire bureau in mid-July increased by 18.7% compared to the first ten days of the month.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin. Workers of the Hegang Mining Bureau, who have won large-scale coal production increases for two consecutive months, responded to the competition proposal put forward by workers of the Jingxi, Fushun, and other five mining bureaus, and further launched a large-scale coal production upsurge in July. The daily output of raw coal in the entire bureau was more than 23,800 tons on the 7th, and reached 32,520 tons on the 14th, an increase of 11.7% over the plan.

At the beginning of July, the Hegang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Mining Bureau successively convened meetings of leading cadres of various mines to specifically study the issue of increasing coal production. After the meeting, all mines widely mobilized the masses, revised production targets, and organized socialist labor competitions.

In the competition, all mine workers tightly grasped the important link of promoting advanced experience. The Twenty-First Tunneling Team of Dongshan Mine promoted the advanced experience of two-stage slotting and the use of pressure-assisted dust collectors for drilling, reducing rock dust and greatly accelerating the tunneling speed. In July, they consistently maintained a level of over 100 meters per day. The Fifth Coal Mining Area of Xing'an Mine, which had previously performed poorly in completing its plans, has achieved daily success since July by firmly grasping the management of the front line of production, and over-fulfilled the raw coal production plan by more than 1,800 tons in the first half of the month.

    竞赛热潮高涨　煤日产量上升
    河南中旬比上旬增加11％，鹤岗一周猛增八千多吨
    新华社郑州24日电　河南省原煤生产在7月中旬的十天中，平均日产量比上旬增加11.3％，超额完成了国家计划。
    进入7月中旬，中共河南省委及时提出了增产煤炭的有效措施。各矿务局的领导干部也都深入现场，分片包干，亲自指挥，因此大大鼓舞了职工的干劲。各采煤工作面都开展了大面积丰产社会主义劳动竞赛，普遍推广了爆破装煤、快速移槽、四班平行作业等先进经验，对提高原煤的产量起了很大作用。
    各煤矿在抓生产的同时，也都抓紧了生产准备工作的领导，普遍补充和加强了掘进力量。7月中旬全省掘进平均日进度达到一千多米，比7月上旬增加了20.6％。各矿在这个期间还特别加强了机电设备和巷道的检修、维护工作。
    又讯　焦作矿务局所属各矿进入第三季度以来，原煤日产量不断上升，全局7月中旬的平均日产量比上旬增长18.7％。
    新华社哈尔滨讯　连续两个月获得煤炭大面积丰产的鹤岗矿务局职工，响应京西、抚顺等五个矿务局职工提出的竞赛倡议，7月份进一步掀起了煤炭大面积丰产热潮。全局原煤日产量7日为二万三千八百多吨，到14日就达到三万二千五百二十吨，比计划提高11.7％。
    7月初，中共鹤岗市委、矿务局先后召开了各矿领导干部会议，具体研究了增产煤炭的问题。会后，各矿井广泛发动群众，修订生产指标，组织社会主义劳动竞赛。
    各矿职工在竞赛中，都紧紧抓住了推广先进经验这一重要环节。东山矿二十一号掘进队推广了两段掏槽和付压吸尘器打眼先进经验，减少了岩尘，大大加快了掘进速度，7月份始终保持在日进百米水平以上。过去完成计划较差的兴安矿第五采煤区，由于狠狠抓紧了生产第一线的管理工作，7月份以来达到了日日红，上半月超额一千八百多吨完成了原煤生产计划。
