    Exhausting the Land's Potential
    ——A Preliminary Investigation of Large-Area High-Yield Wheat Production in Huangzang Commune, Xiaoxian County, Anhui Province
    By Our Reporters　Yu Ming　Wang Linxiang

    The Huangzang People's Commune in Xiaoxian County, Anhui Province, achieved a high-yield record this year of over 800 jin per mu for ten thousand mu of wheat. (See page 1 of this newspaper, June 20th)

    Wheat yields in Huangzang have historically been very low. Why did it suddenly leap forward this year and become a high-yield area?

    According to our extremely preliminary investigation, there are three factors: adapting to local conditions with rational close planting; intercropping wheat and peas; and timely and meticulous cultivation and field management.

    Adapting to Local Conditions with Rational Close Planting

    In previous years, Huangzang used 15 to 18 jin of seeds per mu, resulting in about 150,000 ears per mu, with an average of 20 grains per ear.

    The situation this year is very different.

    According to a sample survey: An eight-mu wheat field in the 18th Production Team of the Baitou Brigade (representative of the growing conditions of about 300 mu of surrounding wheat) has 746 ears per square meter, equivalent to more than 497,000 ears per mu, with an average of 27.6 grains per ear.

    A wheat field west of Daicun Village in the Gaozhuang Brigade can represent about 120 mu of surrounding wheat. There are more than 507,000 ears per mu, with an average of 27.5 grains per ear.

    A wheat field in the Feicun Production Team of the Gaozhuang Brigade has more than 499,000 ears per mu. Although each ear has only 19.3 grains on average, the yield is still high due to the presence of 30% peas.

    It can be seen from the above that the number of ears per mu has increased several times compared to previous years, and the number of grains has also greatly increased.

    The actual yields of the above wheat fields are very high.

    Last year, the amount of seeds used by the Huangzang Commune varied from team to team, mostly between 35 and 50 jin. According to the investigation, high-yield wheat fields that produced over 800 jin generally used about 40 jin of seeds. Two wheat fields in the Xiacun Production Team and the Weizi Production Team, totaling more than seven mu, averaged over 2,000 jin per mu, and both used 48 jin of seeds. A few in this commune used 60 jin, 80 jin, or even over 100 jin of seeds per mu, but these wheat fields showed poor growth during Qingming. After Qingming, thinning was carried out to ensure ventilation and light penetration. Because the thinning was done early and the later management was good, these thinned wheat fields still reached a reasonable density, so the yield was still not low. In addition, the wheat fields with 35 to 50 jin of seeds per mu were not thinned and rarely lodged.

    After the wheat harvest this year, the commune members became interested in close planting. Generally, people believe that 40 jin of seeds per mu is appropriate for next year. It seems that about 40 jin of seeds is suitable for local conditions.

  Intercropping Beans and Wheat for Common Production Increase

    Intercropping beans and wheat can fully utilize the potential of the land and achieve increased production.

    The Baitou Brigade has two comparative examples (the comparative wheat fields have similar soil quality and other conditions):

    (1) The 310 mu planted with pure wheat produced 802 jin per mu; the 642 mu intercropped with beans and wheat reached 852 jin per mu.

    (2) One field planted with pure wheat produced 1,020 jin per mu, while another intercropped with peas and wheat produced 1,120 jin.

    For example, the Miaojie Brigade is a famous wheat granary in Huangzang. The total wheat yield has always been one-third higher than that of the Zhaolou Brigade. This year, the area has not changed much, but because 20% of the wheat land in Miaojie was intercropped with beans and wheat, while 90% of the wheat land in Zhaolou was intercropped with beans and wheat, the total output of Zhaolou caught up with Miaojie.

    Local people believe that intercropping beans and wheat can not only produce more grain, but also more grass. Pea wheat is more filling than wheat. Cows also like to eat pea stalks mixed with wheat stalks.

    Intercropping peas and wheat can fully exploit the potential of the land. Because wheat can use the root nodule bacteria of legume crops to absorb nitrogen from the air. In addition, when there is drought in the spring, the bean leaves can cover the sun and reduce the exposure of the ground, which has the effect of maintaining moisture, so it is more drought-resistant than pure wheat, and wheat can help peas prevent damage from dry fog. According to the experience of the masses, the soil in the land planted with pea wheat is relatively loose, while the pure wheat land is easily compacted.

    The ratio of bean-wheat intercropping in Huangzang Commune is two-eight, three-seven, four-six, and two-five, seven-five. The masses believe that three-seven and two-five, seven-five intercropping are the most appropriate.

  One More Labor Point, One More Harvest

    The amount of wheat seeds sown per mu in Huangzang Commune is generally about 40 jin, the growth is uniform, and lodging is rare. In addition to the good local soil quality, this is also because the cultivation and field management work is done meticulously. For example, a double-layered plow suitable for local conditions was created to ensure deep plowing of the wheat fields; the created close-planting seeder (4-inch sowing width, 1.5-inch row spacing) increased the land utilization rate to more than 70%. At the same time, it ensures ventilation and light penetration between the ridges.

    Field management is implemented by dedicated personnel. Usually, there are more than 3,000 people in the commune managing wheat. During the concentrated management period, it increases to 7,000 people. With a dedicated person in charge and the leadership's work being grasped in a timely manner, the work of topdressing and irrigation during the seedling viewing period has been done in a timely manner. Especially, enough base fertilizer was applied during cultivation, and a large amount of human urine and various quick-acting fertilizers were prepared during the greening and jointing stage, so that the wheat was truly well-fed and watered. During the jointing period of wheat, timely thinning was carried out on some excessively dense wheat to ensure reasonable density. Due to meticulous field management, most of the wheat successfully overcame the lodging and rust disease barriers. (Attached picture)

    地尽其力
    ——安徽萧县皇藏公社小麦大面积丰产初步调查
    本报记者　于明　王林祥
    安徽萧县皇藏人民公社，今年获得万亩小麦亩产八百斤以上的丰产纪录。（见本报6月20日一版）
    皇藏小麦历来产量很低。今年为什么突飞猛进，一跃为高产地区呢？
    据我们极为粗浅的调查，有以下三个因素：因地制宜合理密植；小麦和豌豆混种；耕作和田间管理适时细致。
    因地制宜合理密植
    往年皇藏每亩下种量为十五斤到十八斤，每亩十五万穗左右，每穗平均二十粒。
    今年的情况却大不相同。
    据抽查：白土大队第十八生产队的一块八亩小麦田，（可代表周围三百亩小麦的生长情况）每平方公尺有七百四十六穗，每亩合四十九万七千多穗，每穗平均二十七点六粒。
    高庄大队代村庄西有一块小麦田可代表周围一百二十亩小麦。每亩有五十万七千多穗，每穗平均二十七点五粒。
    高庄大队费村生产队有一块小麦田，每亩四十九万九千多穗，每穗平均虽只有十九点三粒，但因另有三成豌豆，所以产量仍然高。
    从上面的情况可以看出，每亩的穗数都比往年增加了几倍，粒数也大大增加。
    上面几块麦田实收的产量都很高。
    皇藏公社去年下种量，各队情况不一，大多在三十五斤到五十斤之间。据调查，获得八百斤以上的丰产麦，一般下种量都在四十斤左右。夏村生产队和圩子生产队的两块小麦共七亩多，每亩产量平均二千多斤，下种量都是四十八斤。这个公社也有少数是每亩下种六十斤，八十斤，以至一百斤以上的，但是这些麦田在清明时就出现生长不良的现象，清明后采取间苗的办法，使之通风透光。因为间苗早，后期管理好，这些间了苗的麦田还是达到了合理的密度，所以产量仍旧不低。另外，每亩下种三十五到五十斤的麦田却都没有间苗，也很少倒伏。
    今年小麦收割以后，社员们对密植感到了兴趣，一般人认为明年以每亩下种四十斤左右为宜。看来下种四十斤左右，是适合当地条件的。
  豆麦混种共同增产
    豆麦混作能充分利用土地潜力，达到增产的目的。
    白土大队有两个对比实例（对比麦地，土质等条件相似）：
    （一）种纯麦的三百一十亩，亩产八百零二斤；豆麦混种的六百四十二亩，亩产达到八百五十二斤；
      （二）一块田净麦亩产一千零二十斤，另一块豌豆麦混种的则为一千一百二十斤。
    又如庙街大队是皇藏有名的麦囤子，历年来小麦的总产量比赵楼大队要高三分之一。今年面积没有什么变化，只是因为庙街有20％的麦地实行豆麦混种，而赵楼有90％的麦地实行了豆麦混种，结果赵楼总产量赶上了庙街。
    当地群众认为，豆麦混种不但能够多打粮，而且能够多收草。豌豆麦比小麦多出面，又顶饱。豌豆秸和麦秸混在一起，牛也喜欢吃。
    豌豆、小麦混种能充分发挥土地潜力。因为小麦可利用豆类作物的根瘤菌从空气中吸收氮。另外，豌豆麦在春天天旱时，豆叶可以遮住阳光，少晒地面，有保持水分作用，因此比净麦耐旱，而麦子则又能帮助豌豆防止干雾为害。根据群众经验，种豌豆麦的地，土质比较松疏，而净麦地则容易板结。
    皇藏公社豆麦混种比例，有二、八混种，三、七混种，四、六混种和二五、七五混种。群众认为以三、七和二五、七五混种为最适当。多一分工多一成粮
    皇藏公社麦田下种量每亩一般都在四十斤左右，生长整齐，很少倒伏。这除了因为当地土质较好外，还因为耕作和田间管理工作做得细致。例如创造了适合本地的双层犁保证了麦地深耕；创造的密植耩子（播幅四寸，行距一寸五），把土地利用率提高到70％以上。同时保证了畦与畦之间的通风透光。
    田间管理实行了专人负责，平时全公社有三千多人管理小麦，突击管理时，增加到七千人。有了专人负责制，领导工作又抓得及时，所以分期看苗追肥和灌溉工作都作得比较适时。特别在耕种时的底肥上的充足，在返青拔节时人尿水、各种速效肥料准备得多，使小麦真正吃饱喝足。在小麦拔节时期，及时对部分过密的小麦进行了间苗，保证了合理密度。又由于细致的田间管理，使大部分小麦顺利地渡过了倒伏关和锈病关。（附图片）
