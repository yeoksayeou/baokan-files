　　The entire workforce of the No. 1 workshop of Tianjin First People's Paper Mill, during the Great Leap Forward last year, worked with soaring enthusiasm, increasing production by 46% compared to 1957. Due to the increase in production, the required electricity also increased accordingly, causing the power supply transformer to be severely overloaded, which not only affected the safe operation of equipment but also affected the completion of the Leap Forward plan. In response to this situation, the factory Party committee mobilized the workers to find solutions and brainstorm ideas, and convened a workshop technical professional meeting, adopting many in-plant measures to adjust power load and save electricity. For example, the pulping section adopted the method of staggered blade dropping, overcoming the shortcomings of the past where beating machines did not have a fixed stopping time, often causing several beating machines to drop their blades at the same time, resulting in excessive current. They also controlled the use time of the grass cutter, enabling the four pulping machines and the grass cutter to engage in cross-production, and made a dual-power load regulator, further stabilizing the power load. In addition, they improved the transmission equipment, reducing the load, and increased the density of the pulping machine teeth, reducing the beating time from the original twenty-five minutes to fifteen minutes.

　　Through the above measures, not only was the contradiction between the transformer's insufficient capacity and the restriction of production leap forward resolved, but also 9,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved each month, and the monthly plan was overfulfilled by ten to twenty tons.

    节电超产双丰收
    天津第一人民造纸厂一车间全体职工在去年大跃进中，干劲冲天，产量一下子比1957年增加了46％。由于产量增加，需要的电量也相应增加了，造成供电变压器严重超负荷，不但影响设备安全运转，也影响跃进计划的完成。针对这一情况，厂党委发动职工找窍门想办法，召开了车间技术专业会议，采取了许多厂内调整电力负荷节约用电措施。如克料工段采取了交错落刀的办法，克服了过去打浆机没有一定停放时间，往往造成几个打浆机下刀时间赶在一起，造成电流过大的缺点。他们又控制切草机使用时间，使四台克料机和切草机进行交叉生产，并做出一台双电源负荷调整器，使电力负荷进一步稳定。另外，他们又改进了传动设备，使负荷下降，并加密了拉浆机齿，使打浆时间由原来二十五分钟降低到十五分钟。
    通过以上各项措施，不但解决了由于变压器容量不足限制生产跃进的矛盾，反而每月节约电九千度，并使月计划超产了十吨到二十吨。
