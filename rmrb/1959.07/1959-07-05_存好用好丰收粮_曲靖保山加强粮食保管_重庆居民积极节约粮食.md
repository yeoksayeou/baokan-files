Store, Use, and Benefit from the Bumper Harvest
Qujing and Baoshan Strengthen Grain Storage; Chongqing Residents Actively Conserve Grain

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 4th: Qujing and Baoshan counties in Yunnan Province are mobilizing the masses to sun-dry grain and strengthen grain storage to ensure the safety of grain reserves.

The Qujing County Party Committee demanded that neither state nor commune grain should suffer from mold or other losses, and launched a campaign to mobilize the masses to sun-dry grain. Under the leadership and support of the Party Committee, the Yuezhou Grain Management Office organized 114 commune members, government cadres, and family members to sun-dry grain, drying 174,000 jin in one day. In addition to assigning people to sun-dry grain before it is stored, Yanfang Commune stipulates that for every 10,000 jin of grain stored, one commune member is assigned to help the state granary sun-dry grain. After a concentrated sun-drying effort, the moisture content of most of the grain in Malong Commune has been reduced to a safe level. By the end of June, Baoshan County had sun-dried all of its stored grain once, and had also implemented a management responsibility system with designated warehouses and personnel, and formulated a future storage plan, striving to prevent grain from molding or rotting.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 4th: In the comprehensive and in-depth movement to increase production and practice economy, Chongqing has made significant achievements in conserving grain.

In recent months, employees, cadres, and residents of Chongqing have been carefully calculating, strengthening management, and continuously improving cooking techniques, greatly promoting the atmosphere of grain conservation. For example, employees of the Chongqing Department Store care about and value grain conservation, and save grain every month, recently saving more than 1,500 jin of grain and handing it over to the state. The Chongqing Public Transportation Company's First Station often has people working at night, and could originally apply for more than 1,000 jin of night shift food subsidy grain per month, but the unit adopted methods such as unified arrangements, adjustments, and improving the rice yield rate to solve the night shift grain problem themselves, without applying for subsidies from the state.

Leading cadres of many units often go to the cafeteria to inspect and help the catering staff establish and improve management systems. The Party Secretary and Director of the Chongqing Water Pump Factory take time almost every day to go to the cafeteria to understand the grain usage situation, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner. To date, the factory has saved nearly 20,000 jin of grain. The Party Committee of the Chongqing "601" Paper Mill found that the cafeteria management system was not sound enough and that individual personnel did not pay attention to grain conservation, so they educated employees on grain conservation and sent people to rectify the cafeteria work, establishing a grain usage management system and strictly implementing it, resulting in grain savings in April and May.

    存好用好丰收粮
    曲靖保山加强粮食保管　重庆居民积极节约粮食
    据新华社昆明4日电　云南省曲靖、保山两县，发动群众翻晒粮食，加强粮食保管，保证储粮安全。
    中共曲靖县委要求不论是国家或公社的粮食，都不使受到霉烂等损失，发动群众掀起一个突击翻晒粮食的运动。越州粮食管理所在党委领导和支持下，组织公社社员、机关干部和家属共一百一十四人晒粮，一天就晒了十七万四千斤。炎方公社除在粮食入库以前抽人晒粮以外，还规定每入库一万斤粮食，就抽出社员一人帮助国家粮库晒粮。马龙公社经过突击翻晒后，粮食水分大部分已下降到安全标准。保山县到6月底已把全部库存粮翻晒一遍，还实行了定仓、定员的管理责任制度，制定了今后的保管计划，力争粮食不霉不烂。
    据新华社重庆4日电　在全面深入开展的增产节约运动中，重庆市节约用粮作出显著成绩。
    近几个月来，重庆市职工、干部和居民都精打细算，加强管理，不断改进煮饭技术，节约粮食的风气大大发扬。例如重庆市百货站职工人人关心和重视节约粮食，月月都能节余粮食，最近几个月就节余了一千五百多斤粮食上缴给国家。重庆市公共交通公司一总站经常有人夜间工作，本来每月可以申请一千多斤夜班伙食补助粮，但是这个单位采取统一安排、调剂使用、提高出饭率等办法，自己解决了夜班粮食问题，不向国家申请补助。
    许多单位的领导干部常常到食堂检查，帮助伙食人员建立和健全管理制度。重庆水泵厂的党委书记和厂长，几乎每天都要抽时间到食堂去了解用粮情况，发现问题，及时解决。这个厂到目前为止，已经节约了近两万斤粮食。重庆“六○一”造纸厂党委发现食堂管理制度不够健全，个别人员不重视节约粮食，便向职工进行节约粮食的教育，同时派人整顿食堂工作，建立起用粮管理制度，严格执行，4、5两个月粮食都有了节余。
