Penetrating Key Classes to Genuinely Improve Teaching
    The CPC Committee of Shenyang Mechanical Manufacturing School Grasps Typical Experiences and Promotes Them Comprehensively

    (This report) To improve teaching work, one should penetrate key classes, find the root causes, prescribe the right medicine, gain experience, and then guide the entire school. Shenyang Mechanical Manufacturing Industrial School provided such an experience.

    In April of this year, during a comprehensive inspection of teaching, the school's Party committee discovered that in class 2413, out of 373 instances of scores (including questions, tests, and exams), scores of five (excellent) only accounted for 21% of the total, and scores of four (good) only accounted for 22%. The Party committee believed that if they could find the reasons for the abnormal academic performance of this class and take measures to change this phenomenon, they would definitely be able to explore general rules and experiences sufficient to guide the teaching work of the entire school. Therefore, the school designated this class as a key class, to “dissect a sparrow.” The Party committee secretary took the lead, and the Party committee and the specialized branch Party branch investigated the situation and searched for reasons among the students, teachers, class teachers, and League cadres of this class. After multiple individual conversations, symposiums, checking homework, and checking self-study, they discovered some problems in the organization and leadership, teaching, and learning of this class.

    In the past, people had a general impression of this class: many cadres transferred from the military, low cultural level, poor foundation, older age, and it was difficult to learn well. The students in this class also lacked confidence as a result. However, after investigation and research, the facts were exactly the opposite of the general estimates. The reasons affecting learning were multifaceted. In terms of learning: first, some students believed that as long as they were active and hardworking in production labor, they could do anything, and whether they studied or not didn’t matter; second, although many students did study very hard, their learning methods were improper, rote memorization, and superficial understanding, so the effect was not good; third, there were too many unnecessary meetings and activities in the class, and cadres spent even more time on this. Looking at the teaching aspect: due to insufficient understanding of the guiding role of teachers in teaching, some did not dare to boldly and strictly demand students, relaxed questioning, assigning homework, grading homework, examinations, etc., and the tutoring was not patient and thorough enough; some wanted to finish a year's course in half a year, and so on. From the perspective of political and ideological work, some political work cadres (including Party and League cadres, class teachers) confused hard study and conscientious reading with "being only expert but not red," and one-sidedly believed that measuring a student's level of awareness depended on whether he actively participated in political movements and social activities. They did not put their main energy into grasping the students' learning, but focused on leading political movements and social activities.

    After the school's Party committee discovered the above problems, it cooperated with all parties to study solutions. In the class, first of all, through Party and League organizational activities, class meetings, informal talks, etc., they repeatedly discussed to clarify that the central task of students is to study, and to inspire their consciousness and enthusiasm for studying for the motherland and for socialism. The specialized Party branch also made a specific analysis of the students with poor academic performance in the class, and determined whether their poor learning was due to problems with learning goals, learning methods, or due to poor foundation or poor health. According to different situations, different methods were adopted to provide key assistance. At the same time, it was required to streamline meetings and improve meeting quality. The Party committee stipulated: general meetings of the League branch, League group meetings, class meetings, and study group meetings can generally only be held once a month, and meetings without preparation and meetings that do not solve problems should not be held. It also advocated conducting discussions and research in learning, and helping each other; and called on Party members, League members, and cadres to take the lead in studying well. Among the teachers, the Party committee first held a meeting of subject directors. The Party committee secretary reported on the learning situation of class 2413, and asked each subject to help the teachers of class 2413 to teach the course well. Subsequently, the Party committee and the branch Party branch successively held meetings of teachers, and had individual conversations with them, clarifying that teachers must play a leading role in teaching, must strictly demand students, manage and teach, teach books and teach people, and be fully responsible for students. And the following requirements were put forward to the teachers: 1. Immediately provide remedial classes in mechanics and mathematics for students, so that those students who are not learning well can master the basic content of the courses through remedial classes. 2. In lecturing, the speed must be slowed down, and new courses must be explained in combination with systematically reviewing old courses, so that students can understand and thoroughly understand the courses they have learned. 3. All courses that should have been experimented but have not been experimented must be made up. 4. Explain patiently and provide in-depth guidance. In addition, the Party committee also held a class teacher work meeting, requiring meticulous ideological work, and in-depth leadership of students to achieve good study, good labor, and good ideology. In the teaching plan, according to the characteristics of this class, learning and labor time were arranged this semester.

    Class 2413 of Shenyang Mechanical Manufacturing Industrial School now presents a new atmosphere. First of all, the teachers of this class are generally more serious in preparing lessons, patient in explaining, careful in grading homework, in-depth in tutoring, and strict in demanding students than before. The results of the most recent metalworking test showed a very significant change compared to the test at the beginning of the semester - scores of five increased from 33% of the total to 40%. In recent course questions, there has been no occurrence of scores of two (poor). The students all said: "The Party committee cares about us so much, and the teachers teach so enthusiastically, what reason is there not to study well?"

    The Party committee of Shenyang Mechanical Manufacturing Industrial School is summarizing the experience of grasping this typical class, and using it to promote it to all classes in the school.

### 深入重点班级　切实改进教学  沈阳机械制造学校党委抓住典型经验全面推广

    深入重点班级　切实改进教学
    沈阳机械制造学校党委抓住典型经验全面推广
    本报讯　改进教学工作，应当深入重点班级，找出根源，对症下药，取得经验，再来指导全校。沈阳机械制造工业学校提供了这样一个经验。
    今年4月，学校党委在全面检查教学中，发现了2413班在三百七十三人次的分数（包括提问、测验、考试）中，五分仅占总数的21％，四分也只占总数的22％。党委认为，如果能找到这个班的学习成绩不正常的原因，并采取措施改变这种现象，一定能够从中摸索到足以指导全校教学工作的普遍规律和经验。因而，学校就确定这个班为重点班级，“解剖一个麻雀”，党委书记挂帅，党委和专科党支部就分别在这个班级的学生、任课教师、班主任、团干部中摸情况，找原因。经过多次的个别交谈、座谈、检查作业和检查自习等各种形式的调查研究，发现了这个班在组织领导、教与学当中存在一些问题。
    过去，人们对这个班级都有这么一个笼统的印象：调干生多，文化水平低，基础差，年龄大，很难学好功课。这个班级的学生也因此信心不足。可是，经过调查研究，事实恰恰与笼统的估计相反，影响学习的原因是多方面的。在学的方面：第一，部分学生认为只要生产劳动积极肯干，就什么都能干了，学习不学习没有什么；第二，虽然不少学生确实学习很努力，但是，由于他们学习方法不得当，死记硬背，囫囵吞枣，效果也不好；第三，班里不必要的会议多，活动多，而干部在这方面花的时间就更多。再看看教的方面：由于教师对在教学中发挥主导作用认识不足，有的不敢大胆严格地要求学生，放松了提问、布置作业，批改作业、考试等，辅导也不够耐心和深入；有的想将一年的课程在半年讲完，等等。从政治思想工作方面来看，部分政治工作干部（包括党团干部、班主任）把刻苦学习、认真读书与“只专不红”混为一谈，片面地认为衡量一个学生觉悟的高低，就看他参加政治运动和社会活动是否积极。他们没有把主要精力放到抓好学生的学习上来，而是着重于领导政治运动和社会活动。
    学校党委发现了上述问题后，便协同各方面一块研究解决。在班级里，首先通过党团组织生活、班会、漫谈会等反复地讨论，使大家明确学生的中心任务是学习，启发了他们为祖国、为社会主义而学习的自觉性和积极性。专科党支部又将班里学习较差的学生作了具体分析，确定他们学习不好究竟是属于学习目的、学习方法的问题，还是属于基础太差、身体不好的原因？根据不同的情况，采取不同的方法，重点帮助。同时，要求精简会议，提高会议质量。党委规定：团支部大会、团小组会、班会、学习小组会，一般每月只能召开一次，不开无准备的会议，不开不解决问题的会议。并提倡学习中开展讨论研究，互相帮助；号召党团员、干部带头学好功课。在教师中，党委首先召开了学科主任会议，党委书记将2413班学习的情况作了报告，要求各学科帮助2413班的任课教师把课教好。接着，党委和支部都先后召开了任课教师会议，并和他们个别交谈，使他们明确教师在教学中必须起主导作用，必须严格要求学生，管教又管导，教书也教人，对学生全面负责。并对教师提出：一、立即给学生在力学和数学方面补课，使那些学习不好的学生，能通过补课掌握所学课程的基本内容。二、在讲课中必须放慢速度，结合系统地复习旧课来讲解新课，使学生对所学过的课程都能学懂、学透。三、凡是应该实验而没有实验的课程，必须全部补上实验。四、耐心讲解，深入辅导。此外，党委还召开了班主任工作会议，要求细致地做好思想工作，深入领导学生做到学习好、劳动好、思想好。在教学计划中，本学期根据这个班级的特点，安排了学习和劳动时间。
    沈阳机械制造工业学校2413班，现在已呈现了一片崭新的气象。首先，这个班的任课教师普遍地较以前更加认真备课、耐心讲解、细心批改作业、深入辅导、严格地要求学生。最近一次金工测验成绩，就比开学时的测验有很显著的变化——五分从占总数的33％增加到40％。最近各课程的提问，就没有出现过两分。学生都这样说：“党委对我们这样关心，老师这样热心的教学，还有什么理由不能学好呢？”
    沈阳机械制造工业学校党委正在总结抓这个典型班级的经验，以此推广到全校各个班级中去。
