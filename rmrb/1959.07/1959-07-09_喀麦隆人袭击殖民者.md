    Cameroonians Attack Colonialists
    In recent days, the people of Cameroon have intensified their attacks on the French colonialists. Thirty armed Cameroonians attacked the colonial military police in the port of Douala on the night of June 27, killing five French policemen and an air force officer. On the night of July 3, Cameroonian nationalists attacked a French colonial police station in Mbang, near Yaoundé, wounding the French director of the police station. At the same time, nationalists set fire to three small aircraft belonging to a French colonial company at Panya Airport.
    On the night of July 5, a group of armed Cameroonians attacked a European-owned beer hall in the capital, Yaoundé. They killed two Europeans and wounded two others.
    On the morning of the 6th, the colonial authorities dispatched a large number of military police in Yaoundé to suppress Africans and disperse African markets, making it difficult for residents to obtain food.
    The French High Commissioner to Cameroon has declared a "state of emergency" in Yaoundé and Douala. The French colonial authorities have also announced the dissolution of the Cameroon National Committee of the African People's Congress, which it believes is influenced by the Cameroonian People's Union, which has been declared "illegal." The colonial authorities have also ordered a curfew from 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. Anyone without a pass is prohibited from traveling on the roads in Yaoundé and the surrounding area.
    The French High Commissioner, Torre, spoke on the radio, threatening to take district-by-district measures to "ensure maximum security." Europeans in the city are also clamoring to organize "self-defense forces" in an attempt to carry out armed persecution of local Africans.

    喀麦隆人袭击殖民者
    连日来，喀麦隆人民加紧了对法国殖民者的袭击。三十名武装的喀麦隆人曾经在6月27日晚上袭击了杜阿拉港的殖民军警，打死了五名法国警察和一名空军军官。喀麦隆民族主义者7月3日夜晚又袭击雅温得附近姆班加的一个法国殖民警察局，打伤了这个警察局的法籍局长。同时，民族主义者还在潘约机场放火烧毁了法国殖民者公司的三架小型飞机。
    一批武装的喀麦隆人7月5日晚上在首府雅温得袭击了一家欧洲人开的啤酒店。他们打死了两名欧洲人，还打伤了两人。
    6日早上，殖民当局在雅温得出动大批军警，镇压非洲人，并且驱散非洲人的市集，使得居民的粮食供应发生了困难。
    法国驻喀麦隆高级专员已经宣布雅温得和杜阿拉处于“紧急状态”。法国殖民当局还宣布解散非洲人大会喀麦隆全国委员会，它认为这个组织受已被宣布为
  “非法”的喀麦隆人民联盟的影响。殖民当局还下令从二十一时到早上五时实行宵禁。没有通行证的人都禁止在雅温得和这个地区的公路上通行。
    法国高级专员托雷在广播电台讲了话，威胁要按区采取措施，来“保证最大限度的安全”。这座城里的欧洲人还叫嚷要组织“自卫队”，企图对当地非洲人进行武装迫害。
