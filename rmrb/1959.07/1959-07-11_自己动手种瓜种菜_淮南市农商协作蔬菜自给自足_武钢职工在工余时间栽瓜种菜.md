Xinhua News Agency, Hefei - Huaianan City, Anhui Province, is developing vegetable production through cooperation between agricultural and commercial departments, striving to achieve vegetable self-sufficiency with surplus.

Huaianan City plans to sow more than 31,000 mu of vegetables this year, an increase of more than threefold compared to last year. The variety of vegetables has increased from 120 last year to 200. To date, more than 11,000 mu have been sown, and the vegetables are growing well. Since June, the city can eat an average of 1.2 jin of vegetables per person per day.

Huaianan City is a newly emerging industrial and mining city. In recent years, the population has increased rapidly, and the original non-staple food production base was weak. Therefore, in previous years, it relied on supplies of vegetables from other places. Due to long-distance transportation of vegetables, inconvenience in loading and unloading, and ease of spoilage, losses were great, the state lost money, and the masses could not eat enough fresh vegetables. Since last year, Huaianan City's agricultural and commercial departments have cooperated closely to vigorously develop vegetable production, increasing the vegetable field area from 2,160 mu in 1957 to 6,500 mu. Since the second half of last year, it has changed the passive situation of mainly relying on vegetable supplies from other places. In addition to meeting the needs of the city's people, it also supported other places with 12.3 million jin.

In vigorously developing vegetable production, Huaianan City's agricultural, commercial and other relevant departments organized a vegetable production and sales office to arrange production in a timely manner according to market needs. The commercial departments adopted a contract approach, proposing "produce what we buy, buy how much we produce," eliminating farmers' concerns about not being able to sell after increased production, and encouraging farmers to plant according to plan. They provided strong assistance in terms of seeds and tools. At the same time, measures such as "purchasing at the field head, transferring on the spot" and "booking during the day, purchasing at night" were adopted to avoid delaying agricultural work. During the peak season of vegetable production, the processing power of people's communes, organs, factories, mines, schools, and commercial systems was organized to vigorously process and store vegetables, ensuring the supply of vegetables during this year's off-season in the spring.

This newspaper Wuhan, July 10th - Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) workers are making great efforts to produce non-staple foods in their spare time.

According to statistics, within the WISCO plant area in the Qingshan district alone, more than 600 mu of land have been planted with vegetables, more than 4,000 chickens and more than 1,000 ducks have been raised, and more than 186,000 fish have been raised. A small number of units also raise rabbits, sheep, grow lotus roots, and raise bees. The units that planted vegetables early have already harvested. Recently, six units, including the Second Engineering Company and the Earthwork Company, have harvested more than 27,000 jin of vegetables. In the family dormitory area spanning more than ten miles, family members also use the open space beside the roads and houses to grow vegetables.

WISCO solved the problem of labor for developing sideline production mainly by combining mass voluntary labor with specialized management. For example, the reclamation, weeding, sowing, watering, and fertilizing of large tracts of land are contracted out by each unit, and the workers use their spare time before and after work for voluntary labor. Each unit also transferred a small number of old and weak workers as professional personnel to be regularly responsible for field management. (Yuan Zheping, Chen Yubin)

    自己动手种瓜种菜
    淮南市农商协作蔬菜自给自足
    武钢职工在工余时间栽瓜种菜
    新华社合肥讯　安徽省淮南市农业部门与商业部门协作发展蔬菜生产，争取做到蔬菜自给有余。
    淮南市今年计划播种蔬菜三万一千多亩，比去年增加三倍多。蔬菜的种类由去年的一百二十种增加到二百种。到目前已播种一万一千多亩，蔬菜生长良好。从6月份以来，全市每人每天平均可以吃到一斤二两蔬菜。
    淮南市是一个新兴的工矿城市，几年来人口迅速增加，原来的副食品生产基础薄弱，因此前几年一向是依靠外地供应蔬菜。由于蔬菜远途运输、不便装卸和容易腐烂，损耗很大，国家赔了钱，群众还吃不到足够数量的新鲜蔬菜。从去年以来，淮南市农业部门和商业部门密切配合，大搞蔬菜生产，菜田面积由1957年的二千一百六十亩增加到六千五百亩。从去年下半年开始，就改变了主要依赖外地供应蔬菜的被动局面，除满足全市人民需要外，还支援了外地一千二百三十万斤。
    在大力发展蔬菜生产中，淮南市农业、商业等有关部门组织蔬菜产销办公室，根据市场需要及时安排生产。商业部门采取包下来的办法，提出“生产什么，收购什么，生产多少，收购多少”，解除农民怕增产后销售不出去的顾虑，鼓励农民按计划种植。在种子、工具等方面给以大力帮助。同时，采取“地头收购，就地调运”、“白天预约，晚上收购”等办法，做到不误农时。在蔬菜生产旺季，组织人民公社、机关、厂矿、学校和商业系统的加工力量，大力加工储存蔬菜，保证了今年春季蔬菜生产淡季的供应。
    本报武汉10日电　武钢职工利用工余时间，大搞副食品生产。
    据统计，武钢仅青山地区的厂区内，目前已种上了六百多亩地的蔬菜，养了四千多只鸡、一千多只鸭，十八万六千多尾鱼，少数单位还养兔、养羊、种藕、养蜜蜂。种菜种得早的单位，现在已经收割了。仅第二工程公司、土方公司等六个单位，最近已收获两万七千多斤蔬菜。在绵延十多里的家属宿舍区，家属们也利用路边宅旁的空地种上了蔬菜。
    武钢解决发展副业生产的劳动力问题，主要是采取群众性义务劳动和专人管理相结合的办法。如大片土地的开垦、锄草、播种、浇水、施肥等，由各单位分片包干，职工们利用上班前、下班后的业余时间进行义务劳动。各单位也调集了少数老弱工人作为专业人员，经常负责田间管理。（袁者萍、陈育彬）
