Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd - Chongqing is marching towards self-sufficiency in the production of several major non-staple foods such as pigs, chickens, and ducks.

At present, many large-scale pig farms, "Ten Thousand Chicken Mountains," and small and medium-sized poultry farms have been established in the suburbs of Chongqing. People's communes in the suburbs all have pig herds in every team, and every household raises chickens and ducks. By mid-June, the number of pigs raised by the people's communes had grown to more than 1.24 million, and the number of chickens and ducks had exceeded 4 million. The 480,000 peasant households raised an average of 2.5 pigs and 8 chickens and ducks per household. Collective canteens of institutions, factories, mines, schools, and military units in the suburbs, as well as urban commercial, catering, and service departments, also raised more than 47,000 pigs without affecting urban sanitation.

Before last year, 82% to 90% of the pigs and small poultry needed by Chongqing had to be supplied by nearby counties. Since the Great Leap Forward began last year, the city has actively implemented the policy of suburban agricultural production serving the city and vigorously developing non-staple food production. By the end of last year, the number of pigs in stock had reached 1 million. Since the spring of this year, the city has launched a mass movement to develop livestock and poultry production. From the city to the commune production team, party organizations at all levels have a secretary in charge of livestock and poultry production. Each commune has established specialized teams for pig raising and chicken and duck raising to ensure sufficient labor for livestock and poultry production. At the same time, special attention is paid to solving problems such as pig breeds, epidemic prevention, equipment, and technical guidance. At present, the city has 250,000 sows, and 82% of the sows of breeding age have been fully inseminated, providing a reliable guarantee for the development of piglets. The 92 small poultry hatcheries established in the suburbs can hatch 1.4 million chicks and ducklings at a time, with a survival rate generally above 80%. After the large-scale development of pig and poultry production, the people's communes in the suburbs are vigorously mobilizing the masses to adopt various methods to plant and collect feed.

Chengdu, July 2nd (by this newspaper) - In learning from Chongqing's experience in non-staple food self-sufficiency, the commercial and agricultural departments of Chengdu are striving to achieve stable self-sufficiency in vegetables, variety diversification, and quality improvement, while vigorously developing poultry, livestock, fish, and other non-staple food production.

Chengdu needs more than 540 million catties of vegetables per year, calculated at 1.5 catties of vegetables per person per day. Therefore, the city's vegetable base will be expanded from the current 50,000 mu to more than 80,000 mu. In addition, with the purchase of some vegetables from neighboring counties, the daily market supply of vegetables is 1 million to 1.2 million catties, which basically meets market demand. Communes in the suburbs are trying to increase the variety and proportion of fine vegetables.

In order to stabilize production and eliminate the uneven production in peak and off seasons, each commune has made specific arrangements for off-season production, selected suitable varieties for sowing, and improved production technology to increase off-season vegetable production.

The city's poultry and livestock will also be greatly developed. At present, 20,000 mu of feed base has been allocated in the suburbs. By the end of the year, the number of pigs will reach 120,000, an increase of 50,000 over the same period last year; the number of chickens and ducks will reach an average of seven to ten per household; the area for fish farming will be expanded to 5,000 mu, and in addition, fish will be raised in 7,000 mu of rice fields.

Under the leadership of the Chengdu Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the city's commercial, agricultural, and other departments have jointly established a "Non-Staple Food Production Office" to specifically lead the work of non-staple food production. In order to solve the problem of labor shortage caused by the expansion of vegetable fields, the city has decided to withdraw some manpower from district and commune-run industries to return to the suburbs to participate in production, and some areas will use machinery for irrigation and drainage.

At present, the average person in Chengdu can eat about 1.4 catties of vegetables per day, an increase of one-fold compared with the second half of last year, and vegetable prices have also fallen by 23%.

    重庆向主要副食品自给进军
    成都学重庆，争取蔬菜自给，大力发展家禽家畜
    据新华社重庆2日电　重庆市正向生猪、鸡、鸭等几种主要副食品生产自给的方向进军。
    现在重庆市郊区已建立了许多大型养猪场、万鸡山和中小型养禽场。郊区各人民公社队队有猪群，家家养鸡鸭。到6月中旬，各人民公社饲养的生猪发展到一百二十四万多头，鸡鸭繁殖到四百万只以上；四十八万个农户，平均每户养猪两头半，养鸡鸭八只。住在郊区的机关、厂矿、学校、部队的集体伙食单位，和城市商业、饮食、服务等部门，也在不影响城市卫生的原则下，饲养了四万七千多头猪。
    在去年以前，重庆市所需猪和小家禽，82％到90％要靠附近各县供应。从去年大跃进开始，全市积极贯彻了郊区农业生产为城市服务的方针，大力发展副食品生产，到去年年底，生猪存栏数达到了一百万头。从今年春季开始，全市又展开了一个发展家畜家禽生产的群众运动。从市到公社生产队，各级党组织都有一个书记专管家畜家禽的生产。各公社都成立了养猪、养鸡鸭的专业队，保证有足够的劳动力从事家禽家畜生产；同时，特别注意解决猪种、防疫、设备和技术指导等问题。现在全市已有母猪二十五万头，适龄母猪中有82％做到了全配满怀，使发展仔猪有了可靠的保证。郊区建立的九十二个小家禽孵化房，一次可孵化一百四十万只小鸡、小鸭，成活率一般在80％以上。在生猪和家禽生产大发展以后，郊区各人民公社正大力发动群众采取多种办法种植和采集饲料。
    本报成都2日电　成都市商业部门和农业部门，在学习重庆市副食品自给的经验中，争取作到蔬菜稳定自给、品种多样、质量提高，同时大力发展家禽家畜和养鱼等副食品生产。
    成都市按照城市人口每人每天食用蔬菜一斤半计算，全年需要五亿四千多万斤，因此，全市蔬菜基地将由目前五万多亩扩大到八万多亩再加上从邻近各县购进部分蔬菜，每天蔬菜上市量有一百万到一百二十万斤，基本上满足市场需要。郊区各公社正设法增加花色品种和细菜比重。
    为了稳定产量，消除旺、淡季生产不均现象，各公社已为淡季生产作了具体安排，选出适宜品种进行播种，并改进生产技术，提高淡季蔬菜产量。
    全市家禽家畜也将大量发展，目前郊区已划出饲料基地二万亩，到年底猪只将发展十二万头，比去年同期增加五万头；鸡鸭将达到平均每户七到十只；养鱼水面扩大到五千亩，另外准备在七千亩稻田中养鱼。
    在中共成都市委领导下，全市商业、农业等部门联合成立了“副食品生产办公室”，专门负责副食品生产领导工作。为了解决菜地扩大后出现的劳力不足问题，全市决定从区、社办工业中抽出部分人力返回郊区参加生产，部分地区将改用机械进行排灌。
    现在成都市平均每人每天能吃到蔬菜一斤四两左右，较去年下半年增加一倍，蔬菜价格也下降23％。
