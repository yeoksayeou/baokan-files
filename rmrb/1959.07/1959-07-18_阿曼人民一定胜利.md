The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council recently called on the people of all countries to hold a Day of Support for the Omani People's Struggle on July 18. The Chinese people warmly responded to this call. The Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity issued a statement strongly condemning the imperialist aggression in Oman and the southern region of Yemen, and expressing the heartfelt support of the Chinese people for the struggle of the Omani people and the people of the southern region of Yemen against imperialism.

Oman is an ancient country. From the end of the eighteenth century, Britain forced the Sultan of Muscat to sign various enslaving treaties, extending its colonial influence to Oman. In recent years, in order to seize the oil fields in the Buraimi Oasis in northeastern Oman and to intensify its control over the Persian Gulf coast as a base for its further aggression in the Middle East, British imperialism has repeatedly directed the troops of its puppet Sultan of Muscat to attack Oman. At the same time, Britain has continued to massacre the local Arab people in the southern region of Yemen. However, the people of Oman and the southern region of Yemen are heroic and unyielding. In order to win independence and freedom, and to resist imperialist aggression, they have waged a resolute struggle. In particular, in July 1957, under the leadership of the Imam of Oman, the Omani people launched a large-scale armed uprising. They once recovered Nizwa, the capital of the Imamate of Oman, and defeated the puppet army commanded by British officers. Although this uprising had to move from the cities to the mountains under the direct suppression of the British colonial army, the seeds of resistance sown among the people continued to spread and burn.

In order to achieve its colonialist goals, the British aggressors committed extremely barbaric atrocities in Oman. It concentrated 100,000 soldiers and 1,000 aircraft in Oman and the southern region of Yemen, carrying out massacres of innocent people, indiscriminately bombing peaceful villages, and even poisoning reservoirs. These inhumane acts cannot but arouse greater resistance from the Arab people and arouse condemnation from peace-loving people all over the world.

The British suppression of the Omani people's actions has received the support of the United States. When the Omani people declared an uprising in 1957, the United States not only openly slandered the just struggle of the Omani people as a "rebellion," but also supplied the British colonialists with weapons to massacre the Omani people. At the same time, the United States and Britain, disregarding the opposition of the Omani people, reached a so-called "agreement" on the Omani issue in London, stipulating that the right to administer Oman belongs to Britain and the right to exploit oil belongs to the United States. Subsequently, the tentacles of American monopoly capital extended into Oman. The intention of the United States is clearly to squeeze out British colonial influence in southern Arabia in order to replace it. This makes it clear that American imperialism is also an enemy of the Arab people, and even a more insidious enemy.

The struggle of the Omani and South Yemen people against colonialism and aggression is not isolated. It is an integral part of the national liberation movement of the Arab countries, and it has the support of the Asian-African people and peace-loving people all over the world. No matter how arduous the tasks of struggle facing the Omani and South Yemen people, no matter how serious the difficulties they encounter, we are fully convinced that their struggle against colonialism and aggression will surely triumph, and the light of peace and freedom they desire will eventually shine throughout the oases and hills there.

    阿曼人民一定胜利
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处最近号召各国人民在7月18日举行支持阿曼人民斗争日。中国人民热烈响应这个号召。中国亚非团结委员会为此发表声明，对帝国主义在阿曼以及也门南部地区的侵略行动进行了严正的谴责，并表达了中国人民对阿曼人民和也门南部地区人民反对帝国主义斗争的衷心支持。
    阿曼是一个古国。从十八世纪末叶起，英国强迫马斯喀特苏丹签订了各种奴役性条约，把它的殖民势力扩张到阿曼。近些年来，英帝国主义为了攫取位于阿曼东北部的布赖米绿洲的油田，并加紧控制波斯湾沿岸作为它进一步侵略中东的阵地，更屡次指使它的傀儡马斯喀特苏丹军队，向阿曼进攻。同时，英国也不断在也门南部地区屠杀当地的阿拉伯人民。但是，阿曼和也门南部地区人民是英勇不屈的。为了争取独立和自由，为了反抗帝国主义的侵略，他们进行了坚决的斗争。特别是1957年7月，在阿曼教长领导下，阿曼人民发动了大规模的武装起义，他们曾一度收复了阿曼教长国首府尼兹瓦，并且击溃了在英国军官指挥下的傀儡军队。这次起义，虽然在英国殖民军队的直接镇压下，不得不从城市转入山区，但是在人民中间撒下的反抗火种仍然在蔓延燃烧。
    英国侵略者为了达到它的殖民主义的目的，在阿曼制造了极端野蛮的暴行。它在阿曼和也门南部地区集中了十万名士兵和一千架飞机，对无辜人民大肆屠杀，对和平村落滥施轰炸，甚至在贮水池中下毒。这种惨无人道的行径，不能不激起阿拉伯人民更大的反抗，并且引起全世界爱好和平人民的谴责。
    英国镇压阿曼人民的行动，得到美国的支持。当1957年阿曼人民宣布起义以后，美国不仅公然诬蔑阿曼人民的正义斗争为“叛乱”，而且供给英国殖民者屠杀阿曼人民的武器。同时，美国和英国居然不顾阿曼人民的反对，在伦敦就阿曼问题达成所谓“协议”，规定阿曼管理权归英国，石油开采权归美国。接着，美国垄断资本的触角就伸入了阿曼。美国的打算显然是要排挤英国在阿拉伯南部的殖民势力，以便取而代之。这就使人们可以清楚地看到，美帝国主义同样是阿拉伯人民的敌人，甚至是更加阴险的敌人。
    阿曼以及也门南部地区人民反对殖民主义和反对侵略的斗争不是孤立的。它是阿拉伯各国人民的民族解放运动的组成部分，它得到亚非人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持。不论摆在阿曼以及也门南部地区人民面前的斗争任务如何艰巨，不论他们所遇到的困难如何严重，但是，我们完全相信，他们反对殖民主义和反对侵略的斗争，是一定要胜利的，他们所渴望的和平和自由的光芒，终将照遍那里的绿洲和山岗。
