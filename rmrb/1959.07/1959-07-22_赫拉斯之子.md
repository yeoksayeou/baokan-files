Son of Hellas (Note) (Excerpt from a long poem)
Greek poet Petros Antaios, there in that place far from me, in the quiet of the night by the small window, your mother is waiting for you, Manolis. Her hair is gray, and she is indeed a little hunched, she wears black clothes, like our sorrowful Hellas, but she is waiting for you, Manolis! She waits for you as she did on that May night in Athens, when the Fascist bandits were shooting at the heavens and the earth of Athens like evil spirits. She seems to feel that every bullet is aimed at her son. The son has not yet returned… If Death is gazing at her son, how can the mother’s heart be at peace? She shivers, she cannot warm her body and mind, time is like a petrified stone, the days dragging on like years… She wants to be with you before dawn at the window, to see with her own eyes: Hellas is still alive; the marble of the Parthenon has not lost its radiance; the ancient Acropolis of Athens shines under the azure sky of Greece; and tonight our ancient Acropolis of Athens is revived for us. Hold your head high, Greeks, praise the hand that has rekindled your courage! There in that place far from me, in the quiet of the night by the small window, your mother is waiting for you, Manolis. Her hair is gray, and she is indeed a little hunched, she wears black clothes, like our sorrowful Hellas. But she is waiting for you, Manolis! Return to your mother's side, as you did on that May night in Athens!

    赫拉斯之子（注）（摘自长诗）
    希腊诗人　彼得罗斯·安提奥斯在那离我遥远的地方，夜阑人静小窗前，你的妈妈在等待你，曼诺里斯。她头发斑白，也确实有些驼背了，她穿着黑衣裳，就像哀伤的我们赫拉斯，但是，她在等待你，曼诺里斯！她像当年五月之夜在雅典那样等待你，那时法西斯匪徒煞神般地射击着雅典的天地。她仿佛觉得，颗颗子弹都射向她的儿子。儿子还没有回来……如果死神凝视着她的儿子，母亲的心怎能平静？她不寒而栗，她无法温暖身心，时间像僵化的顽石，度日如年……她要在黎明前的窗前，和你一道亲眼看看：赫拉斯还活着；巴德嫩神殿大理石的光芒未熄；雅典古城堡在希腊的碧空下闪烁着光辉；这一夜我们的雅典古城堡又为我们复活了。高高昂起头来，希腊人，赞美这只手吧，是它使你们的勇气重生！在那离我遥远的地方，夜阑人静小窗前，你的妈妈在等待你，曼诺里斯。她头发斑白，也确实有些驼背了，她穿着黑衣裳，就像哀伤的我们赫拉斯。但是，她在等待你，曼诺里斯！你回到妈妈身边吧，就像当年五月深夜在雅典那样！
