Moscow Dispatch from our newspaper on July 24th: The Supreme Court of the Soviet Union recently held a routine plenary session, which mainly discussed the adoption of preventive and educational reform methods, while using the power of society to deal with criminal behavior.

The plenary session adopted a resolution based on a report by Deputy Dean Smirnov. The 21st Congress of the CPSU adopted instructions requiring that the functions of some state organs, including ensuring social order and compliance with socialist living regulations, be gradually handed over to social organizations. The resolution passed by the plenary session of the Supreme Court is based on this spirit. The resolution pointed out: Future primary attention should be focused on the use of preventive and educational methods to prevent and gradually eliminate individual acts of social harm.

The resolution pointed out that, based on the resolution made by the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the basic regulations on criminal legislation passed by the Supreme Soviet in December 1958, the courts have a responsibility to pay more attention to and thoughtfully address the issues of handling criminal offences and sentencing. The court should be concerned as to whether the selected sentencing method is suitable for the severity of the criminal act, should consider the personal characteristics of the defendant, and should be concerned as to whether the sentencing method can maximize the reformation of the criminal. While giving severe punishments to particularly serious criminals or particularly dangerous habitual offenders, the courts should not adopt methods of deprivation of freedom for those offenders who are not particularly dangerous to society and who can embark on the path of correction without social isolation. The resolution pointed out that courts at all levels should consider it necessary, at the request of social organizations and collectives of the working masses, to hand these people over to social organizations and labor mass organizations for probation and educational reform. For those who have committed very minor offences, the courts should suspend criminal trials and hand them over to social organizations for handling.

The meeting especially studied the issue of juvenile delinquency. When hearing such cases, the courts should give special consideration to the issue of not using criminal punishment, but adopting compulsory methods with educational characteristics so that offenders can reform.

The resolution pointed out that strengthening the struggle against crime and other illegal acts cannot be limited to simply mechanically adopting severe punishment measures. More importantly, it is necessary to widely use the power of society to ensure social order. Secondly, it is necessary to prevent crime and eliminate the causes of illegal acts. Regarding this point, the meeting required courts at all levels to establish close ties with social organizations and the working masses. The courts should explain the legislation to combat criminal behavior to social organizations and the working masses. The courts should attract social prosecutors and defenders to participate when hearing some socially significant cases.

    苏联最高法院就刑事惩处问题作出决议
    用预防和教育方法防止犯罪
    同时运用社会团体的力量改造犯人
    本报莫斯科24日电　苏联最高法院最近曾举行例行全体会议，会议主要讨论了采用预防和教育改造的方法，同时运用社会的力量来处理犯罪行为的问题。
    根据副院长斯米尔诺夫的报告全体会议通过了决议。苏共第二十一次代表大会曾经通过了指示，要求将一些国家机关的职能，包括保证社会秩序和保证遵守社会主义生活规律的职能，逐渐交由社会团体管理。最高法院全体会议所通过的决议就是根据这一指示精神。决议指出：今后的主要注意力应放在采用预防和教育的方法上，这样来防止并逐渐全部消灭个别人犯这种或那种危害社会的行为。
    决议指出：根据苏共第二十一次代表大会作出的决议和1958年12月最高苏维埃所通过的刑事立法基本条例，法院有责任更加注意和深思熟虑地对待处理刑事犯罪和处刑的问题。法院应该关切所选择的处刑方法是否适合犯罪行为的严重程度，应该考虑被审判者的个人特点，应该关切到处刑方式是否能够最大限度地促使犯罪人改过。法院在给特别严重的犯人或特别危险的惯犯以严厉的处刑的同时，还应该对那些对社会来说不是特别大的危险、并且可以不和社会隔离而能走上改正道路的犯罪人，不采取剥夺自由的处罚方法。决议指出：各级法院应考虑有必要在有社会团体和劳动群众集体要求之下将这些人交给社会团体和劳动群众组织进行缓刑和教育改造。对于那些犯法非常小的人，法院应停止刑事审判，交给社会团体处理。
    会议特别研究了未成年人犯罪的问题。在审理这类案件时，法院应特别考虑不用刑事处分，而采用带教育性质的强制方式就能使犯罪者改过的问题。
    决议指出：加强和犯罪及其他犯法行为作斗争不能限于只机械地采用严厉处分的手段，更重要的是广泛运用社会的力量来保障社会秩序。其次是预防犯罪和消除产生犯法行为的原因，关于这一点，会议要求各级法院必须和社会团体和劳动群众建立亲密联系，法院应该向社会团体和劳动群众解释和犯罪行为作斗争的立法，法院在审理一些有社会意义的案件时，应该吸引社会公诉人和辩护人参加。
