    The new moon, like a delicate little comb, rests on the peak of Goddess Peak.
    Like a bolt of white silk fluttering in the wind, the river swirls and flows through the high gorges.
    The ship, adorned with lights, is as exquisite as a paper cut-out, sailing into the gorge entrance. The passengers are already asleep, only the gentle sound of flowing water brushing against the ship's sides can be heard.
    Sometime later, a girl in white is walking back and forth along the corridor, sweeping the deck. She is leaning over the railing, throwing her dust cloth into the water, shaking the long rope, and lifting it again. The water droplets are scattered by the river wind, and when illuminated by the light, they look like bright, glistening pearls scattered from her hands.
    The deck is scrubbed until it shines, like a dressing mirror, reflecting her thoughtful and bright face. What is she thinking about? The miserable years of being a maid in the past, or the honor of wearing a red flower on her chest at last year's advanced producer representative conference?
    She smiled. Then, she opened every door, drew every curtain, washed every spittoon clean, and gently picked up the blankets that had slipped to the floor, as gentle as her heart, and covered the passengers...
    She walks to and fro gently, with only the May wind of the Yangtze River Gorges singing a melodious song for her.

    女服务员
    新月像一把精巧的小梳，贴在神女峰头。
    像一匹迎风抖动的白绸，江水旋回地从高峡间流过。
    船，披着满身灯火，玲珑得像一张镂空的剪纸，开进了峡口。旅客们早已入睡了，只听见船舷两边轻滑的流水声。
    不知打从什么时候，一个穿白衣的姑娘在走廊上来回打扫甲板。她正伏着栏杆，把帚帕投在水中，抖了抖长绳，又提起来，水滴被江风吹得四处飞溅，灯光一照，像是从她手上撒出来的亮晶晶的珍珠。
    甲板洗刷得发亮了，像一面妆镜，照见了她沉思而明朗的面庞。她在想什么呢？想起从前做丫头的悲惨岁月，还是想起去年先进生产者代表大会上，胸前戴着红花的荣誉？
    她笑了。然后，她打开了每扇门，拉上了每张窗帘，洗干净了每只痰盂，把滑落在地上的像她的心一样温柔的毛毯，轻轻拾起，盖在旅客的身上……
    她轻轻地走来走去，只有5月的峡江的夜风，为她唱起朗朗的歌。
