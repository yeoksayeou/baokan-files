Heroes Skillfully Build Blast Furnace
By our reporters Cao Baoming and Yuan Zeping

    The east wind is rippling, red flags are flying
    Installation heroes display their prowess
    Fierce battle, skillful battle for seventeen days
    Four furnaces stand tall, soaring into the clouds

These four lines of poetry describe the glorious achievements of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) installation workers on Blast Furnace No. 2. Five days after holding a mobilization rally, they erected three hot blast stoves, each with a diameter of nine meters and a height of more than forty meters, from the ground up. Immediately following that, they installed the twelve-meter diameter blast furnace body in twelve days and twenty-five minutes. According to design specifications, the centerlines of these four giant furnace bodies could each deviate by thirty millimeters, but their actual results were: the maximum deviation of the hot blast stoves was nine millimeters, and the deviation of the blast furnace was three millimeters, resulting in excellent installation quality. They also saved more than 36,000 yuan in tower crane costs.

Among these four furnace bodies, the hot blast stoves were relatively simpler, each consisting of twenty-six rings of steel plates. Each ring, including hoisting, alignment, and welding, took twelve to sixteen hours. The three hot blast stoves had a total of seventy-eight rings of steel plates, so how long would it take to install them all? The workers proposed from the start:
  “Build the hot blast stoves in seven days, setting the standard for fast, good, and economical results.” There were many difficulties in high-altitude installation, so they adopted the method of "combined installation," pre-assembling the seventy-eight rings into twenty-three large rings on the ground, and then hoisting them up, which greatly reduced high-altitude work, both speeding up the process and ensuring quality. The hoisting workers also skillfully changed the three actions of the tower crane—lifting in stages, swinging the jib, and moving the trolley—to be carried out simultaneously. When the crane reached the predetermined location, the jib was also in the correct position, and the furnace ring could be immediately placed. They originally planned to install three large rings on the first day, but they actually installed five.

        Li Huanbo First Breaks Through the Welding Barrier

However, the next day, a weak link was exposed. Each time a ring was hoisted, the second ring could not be hoisted until all the welding was completed. The circumference of a ring was twenty-eight meters, and even the most skilled welding team took four hours to complete the weld; this could not keep up with the hoisting work. In particular, Gong Youming's team, which had the most new recruits, was full of enthusiasm, but their operations were not skilled, causing them to become more flustered and slower the more anxious they became. The hoisting workers could only stare blankly from the side, unable to continue hoisting. Engineering captain Dong Zuoli quickly sent people from Li Huanbo's welding team, which had always been praised as "having a communist style," to provide support. When Li Huanbo arrived at the hot blast stove, he met Li Dengxiang, the leader of the hoisting team. Li Dengxiang stopped him and asked, "We guaranteed to build it in seven days, when can we start hoisting?" This made him very anxious.

He knew that the blast furnace hearth bears a great weight and a very high temperature, and the quality of the welds is particularly strict. Could new technologies such as "double-handed welding," "multi-pass welding," and "four-sided spot welding" be used to speed up the installation? During the construction of Blast Furnace No. 1, he and Wang Zhihai had tried "double-handed welding" on the upper part of the blast furnace, which doubled the speed, and the weld passed radiographic inspection with excellent quality. They had tried "four-sided spot welding" on the inner core tube of the dust collector, which increased the installation speed by several times, and the welding quality was also very good. He carefully looked at the hot blast stove ring. A large ring of steel plate was six or seven meters high, and a four-millimeter wide weld could seemingly guarantee quality if "four-sided spot welding" was used. So, he turned around and went to find Captain Dong. The captain, who was a worker and had studied in the Soviet Union, considered it for a moment and said, "Go ahead and try it."

Li Huanbo immediately selected four excellent welders to stand on four sides. As soon as the furnace shell was hoisted into place, they each welded one or two meters of seams to fix the position of the furnace ring, and immediately ordered the hoisting of the second ring. The result of the experiment was that the weld quality was very good, and the time to install a ring was shortened to more than an hour, even several tens of minutes. He also transferred all the welders in the team to the hot blast stove and taught the new workers in Gong Youming's team the technology hand-by-hand.

      Li Dengxiang Skillfully Determines the Centerline

With the welding problem solved, how could the hoisting workers ensure that the furnace rings were installed quickly and well? Li Dengxiang's team encountered a problem that day: when the nine-meter diameter furnace ring was hoisted, the steel plate bulged and dented, so it aligned with the centerline, but did not align with the misaligned edges. They used a sledgehammer to hammer in the bulging parts, but other places bulged out again, and the centerline also moved, often taking an hour or two to align. At the team meeting after work, the workers in charge of hoisting said that the actions of finding the center and aligning the edges above were too slow, affecting the progress. But the people above said, "If the centerline is not aligned, it can't be fast."

How to solve it? Li Dengxiang had installed seven large blast furnaces in Anshan, Benxi, and Wuhan, and all the difficulties he encountered had been solved. Why couldn't he use a hammer to knock it into place this time? He left Chen Quanzhi and Zhang Jingze, two technicians, and said to them: "We don't have enough experience, so let's all use our brains and study it." The three discussed for a long time, but there was always only one sentence: "It would be good if we could determine the centerline." Could the centerline be determined? Li Dengxiang drew on the table, and suddenly said: "Can we use three angle irons to fix the centerline?" When he said this, Chen Quanzhi and Zhang Jingze understood: "Yes, we can fix it, let's come early tomorrow to experiment."

Early the next morning, Li Dengxiang asked the welders to weld two angle irons on the lower ring and one angle iron on the upper ring, according to the centerline. Once the upper ring was in place, the angle iron above was like a bolt, inserted into the two angle iron slots in the lower ring, fixed and immovable. In this way, no matter how you hammer the steel plate, these three angle irons would always not move, and the centerlines of the upper and lower rings would always be aligned. This method was very simple, but it ensured the quality of the furnace ring installation and also ensured the installation speed.

His method, combined with Li Huanbo's suggested "four-sided spot welding method" and foreman Zhang Xinglie's suggested use of jacks to align the oval shape of the upper part of the furnace ring, formed a new installation experience of "hoisting, aligning, and welding simultaneously," making the quality of the furnace ring installation excellent, and the fastest reached twenty-five minutes to install a ring. On the fourth and fifth days, the large hot blast stoves were seen rapidly lengthening upwards, and they completed the installation of the three furnace bodies in four days and nineteen hours.

        Wang Yunfei Cleverly Changes Three Processes

With the rapid and high-quality installation of the hot blast stoves, the blast furnace also had to be installed. The steel plate of the blast furnace was thirty-six millimeters thick and had a circumference of thirty-six meters, and the quality requirements were particularly strict, making it difficult to install. The Industrial Installation Company transferred their most outstanding hoisting teams, Jiang Xinhe and Zhu Shouju, and their most outstanding welding teams, Li Huanbo and Shi Jiexin, to this project. Deputy Manager Zhang Yude also participated in the labor of Jiang Xinhe's team. The welders in the welding team displayed all their skills, increasing their welding speed from the original three meters per person per shift for vertical welding to more than five meters, and from four meters for horizontal welding to seven meters, welding quickly and well.

What about the hoisting workers? Two days before the official hoisting, Zhang Yude asked Wang Yunfei, the main riveter in Jiang Xinhe's team: "Are you ready?" Wang Yunfei said: "No problem, just waiting for your order." "So fast? You are an advanced team, so you have to show your energy and complete this task excellently." Wang Yunfei smiled casually and said: "We riveters, just holding the hammer and hitting, just hit the important points." Zhang Yude said: "No, comrade, you have to work cleverly!"

"How to work cleverly?" Zhang Yude pointed to his head and said: "You have to start this machine!" Wang Yunfei said on his lips: "How can it be clever?" But he was thinking in his heart: "Yes, I have to think of a clever way to do it quickly and well."

But he couldn't think of a way for two days. He went to discuss with Tang Qidong, a riveter in the same team, but he couldn't think of any ideas. Jiang Xinhe, the leader of the neighboring team (who specialized in hoisting), said to him: "Recall the advantages and disadvantages of Blast Furnace No. 1?" He opened up a line of thought for him.

He recalled that in the past, they had carried out the three processes of aligning the edges, pulling the centerline, and finding the ellipse in stages. Each time a ring was hoisted, five workers first aligned the misaligned edges at the bottom of the furnace ring, and then went to the top of the furnace ring to pull the centerline and find the ellipse, which took at least six hours for each ring, and these three processes affected each other. Why can't they be carried out simultaneously and in parallel?

When installing the second ring, he had discussed a new method with Tang Qidong in advance. As soon as the furnace ring was in place, Tang Qidong led four people to align the misaligned edges below, and he himself climbed to the top of the steel plate to pull the centerline and find the ellipse. In forty minutes, he came down and helped Tang Qidong align the misaligned edges. In one hour and twelve minutes, they stabilized a ring and greeted Jiang Xinhe, the team leader who was waving red and green signal flags on the ground: "Hoist another ring!"

In this way, they increased two apprentices at a time, but the work efficiency increased by four or five times. They originally planned to install only ten rings in thirteen days, but they installed all twenty-two rings.

On the day of installing the last ring of the blast furnace shell, three hot blast stoves were also installing the furnace caps. At three o'clock in the afternoon, as the last furnace cap was slowly raised to the top of the furnace, a burst of firecrackers and cheers rang out on the construction site. (Attached image)

    英雄巧建高炉
    本报记者　曹葆铭　袁者萍
    东风荡漾红旗飘
    安装健儿逞英豪
    猛战巧战十七天
    四炉并立冲云霄
    这四句诗，写的是武钢安装工人在二号高炉上创造的光辉成绩。举行过誓师大会的第五天，就从平地竖起了三座各有九米直径、四十多米高的热风炉；紧跟着，他们又在十二天零二十五分钟内，将十二米直径的高炉炉体也安装起来了。按照设计规定，这四座巨型炉体的中心线可以各偏差三十公厘，但他们的实际成绩是：热风炉最大偏差九公厘，高炉偏差三公厘，安装质量优等。他们还节约塔式吊机的费用三万六千多元。
    在这四座炉体中，热风炉还比较简单些，每座由二十六圈钢板组成。每安装一圈，连吊装、找正、焊接在内，得十二至十六小时。三座热风炉共有七十八圈钢板，需要多长时间才能安好呢？工人们一开始就提出：
  “七天建成热风炉，多快好省数第一。”高空安装困难多，他们就采取“组合安装”的办法，事先在地面上将七十八圈组合成二十三大圈，再往上吊装，大大减少了高空作业，既加快了速度，又保证了质量。装吊工人也将塔式机分阶段起吊、摆杆、走车三个动作，巧妙地改为同时进行，当吊车走到预定地点时，扒杆也摆正了，炉圈马上就能落位。他们头天原计划安装三大圈，实际安了五大圈。
        厉焕波首破电焊关
    但是，第二天就暴露出薄弱环节来了。每吊装好一圈，等全部焊接好，才能吊装第二圈，而一圈的圆周二十八米，最熟练的电焊小组也得四小时才能焊完；跟不上吊装工作。特别是新手最多的龚友明小组，他们虽然个个干劲冲天，但操作不熟练，闹得越急越乱，越乱越慢。装吊工们就在旁边干瞪眼，不能继续往上吊装。工程队长董作礼连忙让一向被誉为“具有共产主义风格”的厉焕波电焊小组派人去支援。厉焕波立即送了三个最好的电焊手上热风炉去。他到热风炉时，正遇上装吊工组长李登香，李登香当时叫住他：“咱们保证七天建成啊，什么时候才能往上吊装？”问的他心里挺着急。
    他知道：高炉炉缸承受很大的重量和很高的温度，焊缝质量要求特别严格，“双手焊接”、“多条焊接”、
  “四边点焊”等许多能加快安装速度的新技术，能不能拿来使用呢？在一号高炉建设中，他曾经和王志海在高炉上部试用过“双手焊接”、速度提高一倍，焊缝经过透视检验，质量优等。他们在除尘器的内心管上试用过
  “四边点焊”，安装速度提高几倍，焊接质量也很好。他仔细看了看热风炉圈，一大圈钢板有六、七米高，四公厘宽的一圈焊缝，采用“四边点焊法”，似乎也能保证质量。于是，他转过身就去找董队长。这个去苏联实习过的工人出身的队长，考虑了一下说：“你去，试验一下。”
    厉焕波立即挑选四个优秀电焊工站在四边上，等炉壳一吊装好，便各焊一二米缝子，将炉圈位置固定，马上叫吊装第二圈。试验的结果，焊缝质量很好，而安装一圈的时间缩短到一个多小时、甚至几十分钟。他还将全组焊工调上热风炉，手把手地把技术教给龚友明小组的新工人。
      李登香巧定中心线
    电焊问题解决了，装吊工怎么保证炉圈安得又快又好呢？李登香小组当天就碰到了个问题：九米直径的炉圈一吊起来，钢板就凸出凹进有些变形，对上了中心线，可对不上错口。他们用大锤将凸出的部分锤进去，别的地方又凸了出来，把中心线也移动了，常常闹个把钟头也对不好。在班后会议上，下面负责吊装的工人就说上面找中心、对错口的动作太慢，影响进度。上面的人却说：“中心线对不准，要快也快不了。”
    怎么解决呢？李登香曾在鞍山、本溪、武汉安装过七座大高炉，遇到的困难都解决了。这次，为什么不能用锤子敲打好。他将陈全智、张晶泽两个技工留了下来，对他们说：“咱们经验不足，就大伙都来动脑筋，研究研究。”三个人商议了好久，始终只有一句话：“要能把中心线定下来，就好了。”能不能把中心线定下来呢？李登香在桌上画来画去，猛然说道：“能不能用三个角铁固定中心线？”他这一讲，陈全智、张晶泽就全懂了：“行呀，能固定，咱们明天一早来试验。”
    第三天一大早，李登香就叫电焊工对着中心线，在下圈焊两个角铁、上圈焊一个角铁，上圈一落位，上面的一个角铁就像栓子一样，插进下圈的两个角铁槽里，固定不动，这样，任你用锤子敲打钢板，这三个角铁始终不移动，上下两圈的中心线也就始终对准不动，这个办法挺简单，却保证了炉圈安装质量，也保证了安装速度。
    他这个办法，和厉焕波建议的“四边点焊法”、工长张行烈建议的用千斤顶找正炉圈上部椭圆的办法合在一起，组成了“边吊装、边找正、边焊接”的“三管齐下”的新的安装经验，使炉圈安装质量优等，而最快达到二十五分钟安装一圈。在第四、五两天里，大型热风炉就眼看着急速向上伸长，他们四天十九小时就将三座炉体安装完毕。
        王云飞智改三工序
    热风炉快速优质安装成功，高炉也就跟着要开始安装。高炉的钢板有三十六公厘厚、三十六米圆周，质量要求特别严格，很难安装。工业安装公司把他们最优秀的江新河、朱寿菊两个装吊小组和最优秀的厉焕波、是介欣两个电焊小组，都调到这个工程上来了。副经理张裕德也到江新河小组参加劳动。电焊小组的工人，都施展出浑身解数，将他们的焊接速度由原来的每人每班立焊三米提高到五米多，横焊四米提高到七米，焊得又快又好。
    装吊工怎么办呢？正式吊装的前两天，张裕德就问江新河组里的主要铆工王云飞：“准备好了吧？”王云飞说：“没问题，就等你下命令。”“这么快？你们是先进小组，可得拿出干劲来，出色地完成这次任务。”王云飞不经意地笑了笑说：“我们铆工嘛，反正拿着鎯头敲，敲重点就行了。”张裕德说：“不行呀，同志，得巧干！”
  “怎么巧干？”张裕德指着自己的脑袋说：“得开动这个机器！”王云飞嘴上说：“怎么巧的了？”心里却在想：“是呀，得想个巧办法，干得又快又好。”
    可是，他想了两天也没想出个门道。他又去找同组的铆工唐其东商量，也想不出什么点子。旁边的组长江新河（他是专搞吊装的）却向他说：“你回忆下一号高炉有什么优缺点？”给他打开了一条思路。
    他回忆起：他们过去都是将对错口、拉中心、找椭圆三道工序分阶段进行。每装吊一圈，先由五个工人在炉圈下部对好错口，然后再到炉圈上部去拉中心线，找椭圆，每圈最少得六小时，这三道工序互相影响。为什么不可以同时并进呢？
    在安装第二圈的时候，他事先就跟唐其东商量好了个新办法。炉圈刚一落位，便由唐其东领着四个人在下面对错口，他自己攀到钢板上部去拉中心，找椭圆。四十多分钟，他就下来，帮助唐其东对错口。一点十二分钟，他们就安定了一圈，向在地面上打着红绿信号旗的组长江新河招呼：“再吊一圈！”
    这样，他们一次增加了两个徒工，但工效却提高了四、五倍。他们原计划十三天只安装十带炉圈，结果把二十二圈全部安装完了。
    在安装高炉最后一圈炉壳的那天，三座热风炉也在安装炉帽。下午三点钟，当最后一顶炉帽缓缓升到炉顶时，工地上就响起一阵鞭炮和一片欢呼。（附图片）
