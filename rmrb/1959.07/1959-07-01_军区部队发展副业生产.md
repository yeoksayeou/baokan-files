Military Region Troops Develop Sideline Production

(Our Dispatch) The Xinjiang Military Region troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are actively developing sideline production. The various vegetables and other non-staple foods produced not only meet their own needs, but also support local needs.

According to recent incomplete statistics, this year a total of more than 14,000 mu of vegetables have been planted, an increase of 67% compared to 1958. The entire military region raises more than 5,200 pigs, more than 1,000 cattle, and more than 9,400 sheep. In addition, more than 11,000 tons of minerals such as mica and gypsum have been mined.

The Xinjiang Military Region troops have adopted a "four combinations" method to develop sideline production, that is, combining service labor with professional production team production; combining centralized leadership with decentralized management; combining large-scale management with extensive use of open spaces inside and outside the barracks; and combining agricultural and animal husbandry-based sideline production with workshop industrial production. In this way, all units have seen a situation where everyone is involved in production and everyone is busy with sideline occupations.

    军区部队发展副业生产
    本报讯　中国人民解放军新疆军区部队，积极发展副业生产。生产的各种蔬菜和其他副食品，除满足自己需要以外，还能支援地方需要。
    据最近的不完全统计，今年共种菜一万四千多亩，比1958年增加67％。全军区养猪五千二百多头，牛一千多头，羊九千四百多只。此外，还开采出云母、石膏等矿石一万一千多吨。
    新疆军区部队发展副业生产，广泛采取了“四结合”办法，即勤务劳动与专业生产队生产相结合；集中领导与分散经营相结合；大面积经营与广泛利用营内外空地相结合；以农牧为主的副业生产与作坊工业生产相结合。这样就使各单位出现了人人生产，个个忙副业的局面。
