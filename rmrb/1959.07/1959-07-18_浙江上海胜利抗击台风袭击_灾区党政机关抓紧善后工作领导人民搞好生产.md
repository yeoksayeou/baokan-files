Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 17th: The center of the typhoon entered the sea north of the Yangtze River estuary this morning. The typhoon warning in Zhejiang Province has been lifted.

    The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee today issued a notice on doing a good job in the aftermath of the typhoon disaster. The notice pointed out that the struggle against this typhoon has achieved a major victory, but areas where the typhoon landed have also suffered varying degrees of damage. Party and government leaders at all levels should immediately do a good job in the aftermath. All places passed by the typhoon should immediately inspect the disaster situation and organize condolences. Great concern should be given to the difficulties encountered by commune members in production and life after the disaster, and relief work should be done in a timely manner to effectively help the masses arrange their lives and do a good job in production. The notice requires all localities to quickly do a good job in summer harvesting and planting and field management; an immediate inspection of river embankments, reservoirs, culverts and other water conservancy projects should be organized, and repairs and reinforcements should be carried out quickly. The notice also requires all localities to summarize the experience of this struggle against the typhoon in a timely manner and commend the model figures in the struggle.

    Party and government leading organs in coastal areas such as Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Zhoushan have taken various measures to strengthen the aftermath of the typhoon disaster, mobilize the masses to continue to rush to harvest early rice, rush to wash seedlings and support seedlings, inspect and repair water conservancy projects, and at the same time inspect the disaster situation after the typhoon, organize condolences, and provide relief to the disaster-stricken masses. More than one million people in coastal areas are continuing to rush to harvest early rice day and night. In Pingyang, Qingtian, Xianju and other counties where the typhoon center landed and passed through, the vast number of commune members are rushing to drain water from flooded rice fields, washing and supporting seedlings, caring for the lodged early rice, late rice and miscellaneous grain crops, striving for the normal growth of submerged crops, and at the same time seizing the opportunity to process and dry wet grain.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 17th: At about 4 am today, the center of the typhoon has left the country northeast of Chongming County in Shanghai.

    Before the typhoon hit, the masses in urban and suburban Shanghai, under the direct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, were on full alert. Factories, enterprises, and warehouses installed flood barriers and raised materials. Emergency repairs were carried out on the dangerous sections of the sea embankment and river dike, and patrols were carried out day and night. Leaders of various units in urban and suburban areas personally took turns on duty day and night.

    When the typhoon passed through Shanghai, the wind force was between seven and eight, with the maximum wind force in some areas reaching nine, and the rain continued. Due to adequate preparations in advance and the relatively weak wind force, the urban area basically suffered no losses. In the suburbs, a small number of early rice and corn were blown down, and some vegetable sheds and oxcart sheds were tilted. As soon as the typhoon passed, suburban farmers organized forces to erect sheds and repair oxcart sheds.

    浙江上海胜利抗击台风袭击
    灾区党政机关抓紧善后工作领导人民搞好生产
    新华社杭州17日电　台风中心今天上午从长江口以北入海。浙江省的台风警报已经解除。
    中共浙江省委、浙江省人民委员会今天发出了关于做好台灾善后工作的通知。通知指出，这次抗击台风的斗争已经取得了重大胜利，但是在台风登陆地区也遭受到不同程度的灾害，各级党政领导应该立即做好善后工作。凡是台风经过的地方，对于受灾情况应立即进行检查，并且组织慰问。对于社员受灾后生产上、生活上遇到的困难，应给予极大的关怀，及时做好救济工作，切实帮助群众安排好生活，搞好生产。通知要求各地迅速做好夏收夏种和田间管理工作；对江塘、水库、涵洞等水利工程立即组织一次检查，迅速修复加固。通知还要求各地及时总结这次抗击台风斗争的经验并表扬斗争中的模范人物。
    温州、宁波、舟山等沿海地区党政领导机关都已采取各种措施，加强台灾善后工作，发动群众继续抢收早稻，突击洗苗、扶苗，检查和抢修水利工程，同时检查台风经过的受灾情况，组织慰问，救济受灾群众。沿海地区有一百多万人正在继续日夜抢收早稻。台风中心登陆和经过的平阳、青田、仙居等县，广大社员正在受淹的稻田中突击排涝，洗苗扶苗，护理倒伏的早稻、晚稻和杂粮作物，争取受淹作物正常生长，同时抓紧处理和翻晒湿谷。
    新华社上海17日电　今晨四时左右，台风中心已在上海市郊崇明县东北出海。
    台风袭来前，上海市区和郊区群众在中共上海市委直接领导下都严阵以待。工厂、企业、仓库装上了挡水板，把物资垫高。对海塘、江堤的险要地段进行了抢修，并且日夜有人巡逻防守。市区和郊区各单位领导人都亲自轮流日夜值班。
    台风经过上海市时，风力在七级到八级之间，局部地区最大风力到九级，阵雨持续。由于事先作了充分准备，风力也较弱，市区基本上无损失。郊区少数早稻、玉米被风吹倒，部分蔬菜棚架、牛车棚倾斜。台风一过，郊区农民就组织力量扶起棚架和修理牛车棚。
