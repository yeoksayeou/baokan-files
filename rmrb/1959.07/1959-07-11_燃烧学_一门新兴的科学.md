    Combustion Science – An Emerging Science
    Wu Chengkang, Deputy Researcher, Power Research Office, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    In the caves of "Peking Man," archaeologists have discovered traces of fire use. This indicates that humans mastered the extremely important technology of using fire hundreds of thousands of years ago. Today, more than 90 percent of the energy used by all of humanity is derived from the combustion of fuel. Therefore, combustion is an important process for energy utilization. In daily life, in industrial enterprises, and in national defense and scientific exploration, from fire for heating to space rockets, there are combustion problems, large or small. In many situations, such as boilers, metallurgical furnaces, internal combustion engines, gas turbines, ramjet engines, and rockets, whether combustion is appropriate or not is often a key issue. However, although humans have mastered many combustion techniques, they know very little about the detailed process of combustion. Combustion equipment is mainly designed based on data and experience obtained from a large number of experiments, lacking a systematic theoretical foundation. This is because the chemical and physical processes of combustion are extremely complex. Combustion phenomena often include simultaneous gas flow, molecular diffusion, heat transfer, and high-temperature chemical reactions. When individual disciplines were not yet mature, their combined result—combustion—was even more difficult to analyze systematically in theory. Moreover, in the past, combustion equipment did not have such strict technical requirements and had relatively low heat release rates. Therefore, there was no strong incentive to fundamentally study the combustion process. However, in the past decade or so, the high-speed development of jet propulsion technology in the world has often required the creation of combustion chambers with high volumetric heat intensity (kilocalories of heat released per second per cubic meter of volume) and a wide operating range. In the design and trial production of combustion chambers, a large number of experiments must be conducted, consuming considerable manpower, material resources, and time. At this point, it was discovered that a lack of understanding of the basic combustion process hindered the smooth progress of new design and trial production work. Therefore, the combustion process had to be studied in depth from the root, to understand it, in order to have correct theoretical guidance in design, trial production, and experiments. With the large-scale development of basic combustion research, combustion science has formed as a new, rapidly developing basic discipline. The development of combustion science has in turn promoted the improvement of various combustion technologies. However, current basic combustion theory lags far behind production practice. That is to say, we now know how to solve many technical problems of combustion, but we are not very clear about why we should do this and what we should do next.

    The research content of combustion science is the methods and theories of combustion. This includes in-depth analysis and improvement of old combustion methods, analysis and exploration of the processes of new combustion methods, and experimental and theoretical research on basic combustion phenomena. These studies are closely related to the vast industrial needs. For example, in order to reduce the size of boilers in large power plants, save materials and space, enhanced combustion methods must be adopted. The modern liquid slag cyclone furnace is one such method. Pulverized coal burns in a strong hot air vortex, and the ash slag is discharged in a liquid state from the slag outlet, achieving a very high volumetric heat release rate. Research on the combustion process in cyclone furnaces can directly promote the development of cyclone furnaces. To thoroughly study this combustion process, one must master the basic law within it—the combustion law of solid particle groups in high-speed, high-temperature airflow. This also shows the relationship between basic theory and production practice. Furthermore, the oil consumption rate and rough running of diesel engines are mainly affected by the combustion process. A recently emerged "controlled vaporization spherical combustion chamber" can achieve very high combustion efficiency and runs very smoothly when using low-quality fuels. It is said that the principle is to spray the oil onto the wall of the spherical combustion chamber on the top of the piston, and then evaporate and burn it at a certain rate. How this combustion process actually proceeds is a question worth studying. In this type of research, it is necessary to have a grasp of the atomization and evaporation of liquid fuels, and the basic theories of the combustion process. The combustion of coke and oxygen in blast furnaces takes place in an extremely complex environment. Here, the solid fuel bed undergoes a variety of gas-solid two-phase fluid thermodynamic and chemical changes under the pressure of forced air. Understanding these processes will greatly improve smelting technology.

    China is a vast country with abundant fuel resources. In order to fully utilize the role of fuels in various regions and burn them in the most reasonable way, it is necessary to study the combustion physical properties of various domestic fuels as soon as possible. For example, the combustion characteristics and related physical properties of coal produced in various regions in power generation, metallurgy, transportation and other uses; the combustion, anti-knock, ignition, and corrosion properties of petroleum products; and the combustion physical properties of combustible mineral comprehensive utilization product fuels are all important research topics. Knowing the performance of fuels allows the adoption of the most suitable combustion methods.

    In cutting-edge new technologies, combustion science is even more important. The combustion chambers of jet engines flying at high altitudes face many new problems. When the volume and weight of the combustion chamber are strictly limited, it is necessary to prevent the flame from being blown out in the high-speed airflow, to burn a large amount of fuel into high-temperature gas in a few thousandths of a second, and to discharge it from the tail. To enable the engine to start at high altitudes and maintain good, oscillation-free combustion under various speeds and accelerations, it is necessary to study the basic principles and methods of flame stabilization in high-speed airflow, the theory of oscillating combustion, the propagation of turbulent flames, the atomization and ignition of liquid fuels in high-speed airflow, and the radiation and heat dissipation in the combustion chamber. In rocket combustion chambers, high-speed combustion, ignition, and oscillating combustion under high temperature and pressure, and chemical reactions in the tail nozzle are all key issues. Research on the combustion of new high-energy fuels is also a necessary research project for new technologies such as high-speed aircraft and space rockets.

    The research method of combustion science is currently mainly to use modern experimental measurement technology to conduct experimental observations on various combustion processes and phenomena. Since the combustion process often involves high-temperature and high-speed reactions, there are some higher requirements in terms of measurement technology. On the other hand, it is also necessary to use the laws of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, physical mechanics, physical chemistry, and heat transfer to establish a systematic combustion theory that conforms to reality. The overall research goal is to find new and effective combustion methods faster and better, and create new combustion equipment, so that humans can better utilize fuel energy.

    Worldwide, the development of combustion science is relatively new and is developing at a high speed. The achievements of the Soviet Union in this regard can be simply demonstrated by the launch of a space rocket. In addition to the high level of other science and technology represented by this rocket, it would be impossible to launch without the world's highest level in combustion science. Soviet scientist and Nobel Prize winner Semyonov is a pioneering authority in combustion science. In addition, there are many combustion science experts with world status. Their research results have enabled the establishment of the combustion science system and have played a significant role in production.

    Since liberation, China's industry has developed rapidly. In the design, trial production, and operation of various thermal energy utilization equipment, many combustion problems have been discovered, raising the need for in-depth research on combustion. Factories, schools, and research institutions have studied and solved many production problems. Especially in 1958, under the situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the staff gave full play to the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, greatly promoting the development of combustion research work.

    China has achieved many results in the research and improvement of combustion technology. A large number of combustion performance measurements have been carried out on various domestic fuels. In terms of boiler equipment and operating technology, many improvements have been made in conjunction with China's coal types, so that the boiler combustion efficiency has reached a fairly high level. This includes a lot of the summary of the rich experience of the masses and the achievements created by the masses in labor. New boiler combustion technology and cyclone furnaces have also achieved preliminary research results and are undergoing field testing. In terms of internal combustion engines, high-efficiency diesel engine combustion chambers have also been developed. Although in-depth research on combustion processes and basic combustion theory has just begun, under the situation of rapid industrial progress across the country and the correct leadership of the Party, this new discipline will surely develop rapidly.

    The scope of combustion science is very broad, and the significance of combustion research is very significant. This emerging science has had a good start in our country. In the near future, China's combustion science will have a fairly large research team and will play its due role in China's economic construction.

    燃烧学——一门新兴的科学
    中国科学院动力研究室副研究员　吴承康
    在“北京人”穴居的地方，考古工作者发现了用火的遗迹。这就表示远在几十万年以前，人已掌握了用火这一项极重要的技术。现在，整个人类所利用的能量，百分之九十几是从燃料经过燃烧而得来的。因此燃烧就成为能源利用的一个重要过程。在日常生活里，在工业企业中，在国防与科学的探索中，从生火取暖到宇宙火箭，其中莫不有或大或小的燃烧问题。在很多的场合，如锅炉、冶金炉、内燃机、燃气轮机、冲压式喷气机和火箭等重要的热能利用技术中，燃烧的适宜与否往往是一个关键性的问题。但是，人类虽已掌握了很多燃烧的技术，而对燃烧的详细过程，却知道得很少。燃烧设备也主要是根据大量试验所得的数据和经验来设计，而缺乏系统理论的基础。这是因为燃烧的化学物理过程是极复杂的。燃烧现象往往包括了同时进行的气体流动、分子扩散、传热和高温化学反应等过程。在各个单独学科还不太成熟的时候，他们的综合结果——燃烧，就更不易系统地加以理论的分析。又加以过去的燃烧设备，技术要求没有现在这样严格，发热强度还比较低。因此也没有大力从根本上来研究燃烧过程。但是近十几年来，世界上喷气推进技术高速度的发展，经常要求造出容积热强度（每立方公尺体积中每秒钟发出的千卡热量）高，运行范围广的燃烧室。而在燃烧室的设计试制工作中，必须经过大量的试验，所消耗的人力、物力和时间十分可观。这时就发现对燃烧基本过程的缺乏理解，阻碍了新的设计试制工作的顺利进行。因此对于燃烧过程，就不得不深入地从根本上去研究它，了解它，以求在设计、试制和试验中，有正确的理论指导。在燃烧基本研究大量开展的同时，燃烧学就形成为一门崭新的、高速发展的基础学科。燃烧学的发展，又促进了各种燃烧技术的改进。不过目前的燃烧基本理论，还大大落后于生产实践。这就是说，现在我们已经知道怎样去解决许多燃烧的技术问题，但是对于为什么要这样做和更进一步应该怎样做，还不是十分清楚的。
    燃烧学的研究内容是燃烧的方法和燃烧的理论。这里面包括了对旧的燃烧方法的深入分析和改进，对新的燃烧方法的过程的分析和探索，燃烧基本现象的实验和理论研究等方面。这些研究和广大的工业需要有着密切的联系。例如要使大发电厂的锅炉尺寸缩小，节省材料和地位，必须采取强化燃烧的方法。现代的液态排渣旋风炉，是其中的一种。煤粉在强烈的热风旋涡中燃烧，灰分的熔渣，则在液体状态下由出渣口排出，容积发热强度可以很高。对于旋风炉内燃烧过程的研究，就能直接促进旋风炉的发展。而要深入研究这个燃烧过程，就必须对其中的基本规律——固体颗粒群在高速高温气流中的燃烧规律，有所掌握。由此也可看出基本理论和生产实践中的关系。又如柴油机的油耗率和运行粗暴性主要是受到燃烧过程的影响。最近出现的一种“控制气化球形燃烧室”能得到很高的燃烧效率，而且在使用低质燃料时，运行也很柔和。据说它的道理是使喷出的油涂在活塞顶部的球形燃烧室壁上，随即以一定的速度蒸发燃烧。这种燃烧过程究竟如何进行，是很值得研究的问题。在这类研究中，就要求对液体燃料的雾化、蒸发，对燃烧过程的基本理论有所掌握。高炉中焦炭和氧气的燃烧，是在极复杂的环境中进行的。这里，固体燃料床在鼓风压力下，进行着多种多样的气固两态的流体热力化学变化。这些过程的了解将对冶炼技术的改进起很大的作用。
    我国地大物博，燃料资源十分丰富。为了要充分发挥各地燃料的作用，使它们能最合理地燃烧，必须尽快地对各种国产燃料的燃烧物理性质进行研究。例如各地出产的煤，在发电、冶金、运输等用途中的燃烧特性及其有关的物理性质；石油产品的燃烧、抗爆震、点火、腐蚀等性能；可燃矿物综合利用产品燃料的燃烧物理性质，都是重要的研究课题。知道了燃料的性能，就可以采用最适宜的燃烧方法。
    在尖端性的新技术中，燃烧学更显得重要。高空飞行的喷气发动机的燃烧室，面临着很多新的问题。在烧燃室体积和重量受到严格限制时，要使火焰在高速气流中不致被吹熄，使大量的燃料在千分之几秒时间内，烧成高温的气体，从尾部排出，要使发动机能在高空起动，并在各种速度和加速度情况下维持良好的、无振荡的燃烧，就有必要研究高速气流中火焰稳定的基本原理和方法，振荡燃烧的理论，紊流火焰的传播，高速气流中液体燃料的雾化和点火，燃烧室中的辐射和散热等问题。在火箭燃烧室中，高温高压下的高速燃烧，点火和振荡燃烧，尾喷管中的化学反应等，都是关键问题。新的高能燃料燃烧研究，也是高速飞机、宇宙火箭等新技术中的必要研究项目。
    燃烧学的研究方法，在目前主要是运用现代化的试验测量技术，对各种燃烧过程和现象进行实验观察。由于燃烧过程中往往牵涉到高温和高速的反应，在测量技术方面是有一些较高的要求的。另一方面，也要运用热力学、流体力学、物理力学、物理化学和传热学的定律，来建立符合实际的，有系统的燃烧理论。总的研究目的还是为了更快更好地找出新的有效燃烧方法，造出新的燃烧设备，使人类能更好地利用燃料能源。
    在世界范围内，燃烧学的发展是较新的，而且正在以高速度发展着。苏联在这方面的成就，可以简单地用发射宇宙火箭这一件事来表明。除了这台火箭所表示的其他的科学技术的高度水平以外，在燃烧学方面如果没有世界最高的水平，也是无法发射的。苏联科学家、诺贝尔奖金获得者谢苗诺夫，是燃烧学方面创始性的权威学者。此外还有许多位有世界地位的燃烧学专家。他们的研究成果，已使燃烧学的体系建立起来，并在生产上起了很大的作用。
    我国自解放以来，工业迅速地发展，在各种热能利用设备的设计、试制和运行中，发现了不少燃烧问题，对燃烧的深入研究提出了要求。工厂、学校和研究机构已研究和解决了许多生产上的问题。尤其是1958年，在全国大跃进的形势之下，工作人员发挥了敢想敢干的精神，大大推进了燃烧研究工作的开展。
    我国在燃烧技术的研究改进方面，已取得了不少成果。对各种国产燃料，进行了大量的燃烧性能测定工作。在锅炉设备和运行技术方面，结合我国煤种，作了不少改进，因而使锅炉燃烧效率，达到相当高的水平。这里面有很多群众丰富经验的总结和群众在劳动中创造的成果。新的锅炉燃烧技术和旋风炉，亦已得到初步研究成果，正进行实地试验。在内燃机方面，也做出了高效率的柴油机燃烧室。深入的燃烧过程和燃烧基本理论的研究虽然还是刚刚开始，但是在全国工业迅速跃进的形势和党的正确领导之下，这门新的学科一定会很快地发展起来。
    燃烧学的涉及面是非常广阔的，燃烧研究的意义是非常重大的。这一门新兴的科学，在我国已经有了良好的开端。不久的将来，我国的燃烧学将有一支相当大的研究队伍，并将在我国的经济建设中起到应有的作用。
