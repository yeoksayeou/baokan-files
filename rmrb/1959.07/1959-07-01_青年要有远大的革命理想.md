Youth Should Have Lofty Revolutionary Ideals
Xu Jiatun, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CPC

"Ambition" is a Reflection of the Demands of the Times

I would like to talk to young comrades about the issue of setting great ambitions. "Ambition," in the final analysis, is a reflection of the demands of the times. When historical development presents new tasks, society needs forces capable of completing these tasks. This need, through various means, is reflected in people's minds, pointing out the direction of their efforts and arousing their desire to move forward, thus becoming people's "ambition," or aspiration and determination. Simply put, aspiration and determination are reflections of social existence. What kind of ambition should young people have in what era and what historical period, and what kind of ambition should a certain class require young people to have? Whether people are conscious or unconscious, their aspirations and determination cannot be separated from the needs of a certain era and the interests of a certain class. It is very necessary to explain this point. This can enable us to have a correct direction when setting ambitions, more consciously adapt to the requirements of our era, and more consciously serve the interests of the proletariat. This is one aspect of the issue. On the other hand, the realization of "ambition" cannot be separated from certain social conditions. To give a recent example, before liberation, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, some young people also set progressive and revolutionary ambitions, wanting to do great things for the country and the nation and to make contributions to social progress. However, the corrupt economic and political systems suffocated, suppressed, and destroyed the ambitions of young people. The reactionary ruling class vainly attempted to turn the masses of the people into docile slaves, and they adopted various methods to erode and undermine people's revolutionary will. The so-called "talk less about doctrines" of Hu Shih and his ilk was a kind of "anesthetic" to extinguish the revolutionary will of young people. The reactionaries even used imprisonment and slaughter to eliminate the revolutionary will of young people. At that time, the revolutionary youth's setting of ambitions and the reactionary ruling class's anti-setting of ambitions was a sharp struggle. It is also very necessary to explain this point. The meaning is nothing more than hoping that young comrades understand that the social conditions we are in today are very superior. We should cherish these social conditions, rely on them, give full play to our initiative, and strive to realize our revolutionary aspirations.

Young People Should Dare to Set Ambitions

To be worthy of this era, young comrades should have the spirit of "everyone can become a sage," soaring ambitions, standing tall, seeing far, daring to think, dare to act, and dare to do, making extraordinary contributions to the Party and the country in ordinary labor, daring to climb the peaks of science, and daring to create unprecedented miracles. Today, our country needs many outstanding talents. Our scientists, theorists, writers, and artists are not too many, but too few. We must cultivate a large number of talents, not only general scientists, theorists, writers, and artists, but also world-class scientists, theorists, writers, and artists; we must have today's Lu Xun and Li Shizhen, and we must have China's Pavlov, Michurin, Popov, Edison, Tolstoy, Hugo, and Vinci. Recently, the sports world produced the world's number one table tennis player, Rong Guotuan. He is a young man, and more outstanding figures in various fields should emerge from among the youth. Young comrades should dare to propose: I want to be a person with outstanding achievements.

Young people should have such lofty ideals. Chairman Mao proposed a policy in literature and art, namely, the combination of revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism. The so-called revolutionary romanticism is to have an optimistic spirit about the future of the revolution, to have magnificent and splendid visions for the future new society, and to have great ideals for creating a new world. I think that not only should there be revolutionary romanticism in literature and art, but there should also be revolutionary romanticism in each of our lives, that is to say, to have ideals, to have lofty ideals. Although the ideal is still an ideal at the time, the matter has not yet become a reality, but after a period of time, under certain conditions, and through subjective efforts, the ideal will become a reality. Humans are different from animals. Humans have brains and can think. Through social labor and production practice, people's understanding of the objective world gradually deepens, and people gradually become clear about the laws of the development of things. People can put forward lofty aspirations in the long process of understanding the laws of the development of things, based on their understanding of the laws. This aspiration is the ideal. It seems that it contains many imaginative components, but this imagination is not without objective basis. It can become a reality, it can guide people forward, and it is an indispensable thing in people's lives.

Do Not Regard Setting Ambitions as Individualism

Some people worry that setting great ambitions will be criticized by others as "individualism." In fact, this is still because they have not clarified the following two questions, namely: on what kind of worldview and outlook on life to base the ambition, and whether the ambition set is an ideal or a fantasy. If the ambition you set is not an individualistic ambition, nor a fantasy, then how can people criticize it; even if a few people criticize it, what is there to be afraid of? Setting ambitions, setting great revolutionary ambitions, is open and aboveboard, and there is no need to have any worries at all. We resolutely oppose individualism, because it is the most prominent thing in bourgeois ideology and the core of the bourgeois outlook on life. Everything is for the individual, for oneself, even at the expense of harming others to benefit oneself. This kind of thinking is diametrically opposed to socialist and communist thinking, and it runs counter to the new worldview and morality. It will only corrupt people's ambition, and will never help people to set great ambitions, so we must actively prevent this harmful thinking from eroding young people. We hope that every young person has a correct worldview and outlook on life, and on this basis, sets great ambitions, makes outstanding contributions to the people, and does not plan for personal fame and gain, or engage in some vulgar and petty personal interests. "A good man should aspire to all corners of the land," and should aspire to the interests of the masses of the people and to the cause of socialism and communism. Only planning for oneself, for example, struggling for the "four major items" (gold pen, watch, radio, bicycle), cannot be said to have any great ambition, but can only be said to have no ambition, and can even be said to be unpromising. However, people must not say that a young person's ambition to make greater contributions to the people is "individualism." Associating "setting great ambitions" with "individualism," and understanding "setting great ambitions" and "individualism" as synonymous without analysis is in any case unscientific and does not conform to reality. Of course, the influence of the ideology of the exploiting classes still exists today. It is unrealistic to say that all people who set great ambitions have no individualism at all; at the same time, young people have little social experience and lack practical experience, and it is also unrealistic to say that all people who set great ambitions have no elements of fantasy. The problem is not to give up eating for fear of choking, and not to discourage young people from setting ambitions because some young people have some individualism and unrealistic ideas. In fact, individualism and impracticality are not caused by setting ambitions. On the contrary, it is because of individualism and impracticality that ambitions cannot be set well. Whether a person's ambition is individualistic and unrealistic or not must be specifically analyzed and has objective standards. If it is not individualistic and unrealistic, don't be afraid of people's criticism; if it is, you should welcome people's criticism. Only through criticism and self-criticism, constantly struggling with individualism, overcoming individualism, and establishing communist ideology, will it be conducive to setting ambitions. Conversely, people with serious individualism, who are preoccupied with personal gains and losses and cannot extricate themselves, who are emotionally hot and cold, and who are mediocre, cannot set any great ambitions. Furthermore, if individualism is not completely eradicated, it will ultimately fail the test in the process of setting ambitions. For example, when encountering some difficulties or setbacks, individualism will retreat, making people negative and decadent, and abandoning their original ambitions; for example, when there is a slight achievement, individualism will come out to offer a toast, making you feel elated and complacent, forgetting yourself, not only will it make you stagnate, but it will also make you look down on everything, fall into the mire of nihilism, or degenerate into a right-wing element who opposes the Party and opposes the people.

Setting Ambitions Cannot Be Separated from the Needs of the Country

Some people also ask, what if there is a conflict between setting ambitions and the needs of the country? Raising such a question reflects that some young comrades do not fully understand the relationship between setting ambitions and the demands of the times and social needs. The more the country needs, the more it helps young people to set ambitions. Fundamentally speaking, there is no contradiction. At the same time, the needs of the country are multifaceted, and it will never only need talents in a certain field. People can choose in the broad field of national needs. "The sea is wide for fish to leap, and the sky is high for birds to fly." As long as you recognize the inevitability of social development, your ambition is free. To go a step further, the country sometimes puts forward urgent key needs, such as the need for doctors, teachers, geologists, etc. This will only help young people better link their ambitions with social needs, and will not limit or damage the ambitions of young people. Of course, there is a question of personal interests and hobbies here, but personal interests and hobbies are also products of history, not innate, nor unchangeable. For a revolutionary youth, when there are some contradictions between the needs of the country and personal initially formed hobbies, the needs of the country should be obeyed first. "I will do whatever the country needs me to do." Every young person should have this attitude. This is a manifestation of having great ideals and high awareness. Without this, the 600 million people of the country cannot be united, and you cannot be said to be serving socialism wholeheartedly. This is a major prerequisite. Under this major prerequisite, when the country makes unified considerations of needs, it can of course take care of everyone's own hobbies as much as possible, that is, assign learning and work according to everyone's hobbies and interests; but there are also cases where assignments are made not according to each person's hobbies but according to the needs of the country. In this way, people can cultivate new hobbies under new needs, and they can also study what they originally liked in their spare time. Many leading comrades of our Party and country have come this way. They were not politicians and military strategists from the beginning. In their youth, some were engaged in culture and art, some were studying engineering, and some wrote good articles, but for the needs of the revolutionary struggle, they resolutely put aside their hobbies temporarily and engaged in the struggles that the country and the nation urgently needed. This is the manifestation of having great ideals and high awareness as mentioned earlier. In the years of long revolutionary struggle, for various reasons, many people gradually gave up their original hobbies and established new hobbies. Today, many of them have become outstanding politicians, educators, military strategists, diplomats, and "entrepreneurs" in our country; at the same time, there are also many people who have persisted in their original hobbies. For example, there are many leading comrades in our Party who are not only great politicians and thinkers, but also have a deep understanding of literature and art. Therefore, setting great ambitions, studying one's own hobbies, and obeying the needs of the country are the unity of opposites. As long as you handle it properly, the contradictions can be unified. Whoever exaggerates personal hobbies to an inappropriate degree and makes his ambitions deviate from the needs of society will consciously or unconsciously fall into the viewpoint of idealism. In fact, according to historical materialism, the so-called personal interests are ultimately determined by social existence and the needs of social development. Sun Wukong cannot escape the palm of the Tathagata Buddha, and people's ambitions, interests, hobbies, etc. cannot escape the palm of social material living conditions and their development trends.

Not daring to express one's ambitions, not daring to express great ambitions, and not daring to be the vanguard of the era is not the spirit of our era, let alone the spirit of the revolutionary youth of our era.

Only Diligent Effort Can Realize Great Ambitions

However, having great ambitions is only the beginning of the matter. To turn great ambitions into reality, we must also muster great efforts, study diligently, practice hard, work hard, and carry out solid, arduous, and meticulous daily work. There is an old Chinese saying, "Envy fish by the river, better to go home and weave a net." A person who sees good fish in the river and is determined to catch them, but he only sets his ambition every day, and says "Good fish, good fish" by the river every day, but does not weave a net or take action, his great ambition will never be realized. Therefore, after determining the great ambition, the most important thing is to plan your actions according to the requirements of the great ambition, muster your strength, take steps, and realize the established great ambition step by step.

The realization of great ambitions will inevitably have a difficult struggle process. Great ambition reflects a wish, which is generally higher than the existing ability of young people. That is to say, the existing ability is generally not enough to realize this great ambition, so it is necessary to exercise, to study, and to work hard. Bourgeois philosophers advocate "the balance of wish and ability," and they mean "to have wishes according to ability." They are attempting to paralyze the will of young people to make revolution and create. We say that wish and ability always develop through imbalance, balance, and imbalance. Wish reflects an objective need and task. We cannot give up a correct wish and a task that must be strived to be realized because we are temporarily unable to do so. Instead, we must actively strive to create conditions to improve our ability to the extent that it is sufficient to realize our wish and complete the task, and then exercise new abilities and create new conditions according to new tasks and new wishes. Such a process requires us to make unremitting efforts and put in real effort to exercise and improve ourselves. This practical work of exercise and improvement is of course not as full of ideal rainbows and as exciting as when setting ambitions. However, without decades of hard training, could Mei Lanfang and Gai Jiaotian perform so skillfully? Without decades of climbing mountains and crossing ridges, could Li Shizhen write "Compendium of Materia Medica"? Without years of physical training and basic ballet movements, could Ulanova dance on the stage like clouds rolling across the sky? Without years of unremitting physical exercise, could Chen Jingkai create a world record in lightweight weightlifting? Obviously, achievements in ambition and success in work are all obtained through hard training and persistent study. If you don't muster great efforts, you can't withstand such a difficult exercise process.

In the process of exercise, the "roadblock" that is often encountered is difficulty. If the ambition is not firm, after several difficulties, you will be discouraged and give up your original ambition, so in the process of realizing great ambitions, we must have sufficient estimates of difficulties, and have sufficient mental preparation for overcoming difficulties. Escaping difficulties and attempting to grow in a greenhouse cannot be counted as ambitious, and cannot truly realize any great ambition. We must learn the spirit of Yugong moving mountains, learn the perseverance of many great scientists who have failed repeatedly, and learn the heroic spirit of countless revolutionary martyrs who have the will of steel and are unyielding to complete our great aspirations. In short, we must have a great effort, be down-to-earth, not be discouraged by failure, not be proud of victory, not fear hardship, not be afraid of hard work, not take shortcuts, not advance along the path of least resistance, but hold a scientific attitude, take practical steps, forge ahead bravely, and persevere.

Pay Attention to Learning from the Experience of Predecessors and Others

In such a process of setting great ambitions and mustering great efforts, we must advance along the correct path and have the correct method. Judging from the current situation of young comrades setting ambitions and mustering efforts, the first thing to pay attention to is to adhere to the combination of theory and practice. We must participate in production labor and political movements, and we must oppose the separation of theory from practice, but we cannot deny the necessity of learning theory and learning book knowledge because of this. Regarding the relationship between theory and practice, some people say theory-practice-theory, which is idealism, and must be opposed. The formula we advocate is practice-theory-practice. All true knowledge comes from practical experience, but people cannot go through practice in everything. For an individual, there is direct experience and indirect experience, and most of a person's knowledge comes from indirect experience. The old education method separated indirect experience from direct experience, and we advocate the combination of the two. This is the case in factories, schools, and institutions. 78.1% of the air is nitrogen and 21% is oxygen. This is direct experience for those who have experimented, but indirect experience for more people. This experience is correct and reliable. Another example is chemical elements. There are now one hundred and two kinds. These one hundred and two kinds have been determined by many scientists through experiments. This is direct experience for those scientists who have conducted experiments, but indirect experience for most people. This experience is also correct and reliable. Of course, not all indirect experience is reliable, so we must be discerning when learning and rely on practice to test it. For our young people, what is important today is to learn both direct and indirect experience. Some people say that only direct experience is needed, which is a misunderstanding. We must not only learn direct experience, but also learn indirect experience, and learn the research results of many people at home and abroad, ancient and modern. It is necessary to recognize and test whether the experience of predecessors is correct through practice, develop the experience and theory of predecessors, and create new experience and theory. Some people say, aren't we advocating emphasizing the present and belittling the past? Why should we learn from the experience of our predecessors? Yes, we must emphasize the present and belittle the past, but this does not mean that we do not need the past. The past is the source of human development. Without the past, there would be no present. Emphasizing the present and belittling the past is a question of emphasis, not a question of whether it is needed. We advocate emphasizing the present and belittling the past, and the purpose is nothing more than to make the past serve the present. Lenin said: "Only by arming one's mind with all the knowledge of mankind can one become a true communist." So we say that we must practice, labor, work, and participate in political struggles; and we must also read books and accept the experience of predecessors and others. Neither of these can be neglected.

Learning from the Elderly, Surpassing the Elderly

Secondly, there is also the relationship between young people and adults. The Jiangsu Yang Opera Troupe recently performed "A Hundred-Year-Old Takes Command." In the play, there is a martial arts match between Mu Guiying and her son Yang Wenguang. When the son knocked his mother off the horse, the whole family was overjoyed and repeatedly said "Each generation is better than the previous one." Each generation is better than the previous one, which is the law of human development. The ancients said: "Blue comes from indigo but is bluer than indigo," and "Ice is made of water but is colder than water." This statement is correct. Of course, this does not mean that young people can be better than previous generations as soon as they are born without effort. Later generations must surpass older generations, and young people must surpass older people. They must go through arduous exercise and study, and first of all, they must learn from older people and adults. Now some young people do not handle the relationship with adults and older people appropriately. It should be seen that most of young people's knowledge comes from adults and older people. Older people have more knowledge, but they are older; there are also many older people who have not been exercised, their thinking has not been transformed well, and there are still some problems in their positions and viewpoints, their experience is also one-sided, and there are more old views, but it must be admitted that their knowledge is rich, and young people should learn from them humbly and critically. It seems that learning is the main thing. Learn the skills, and on the basis of what you have learned, develop and improve through your own practice, and you can surpass them. We must respect older people. For their shortcomings and mistakes, if they are problems of understanding, we should view them from a historical perspective and take a respectful and well-intentioned attitude to help them. Only in this way can we learn things, and older people can teach us their skills without reservation.

Red is Not Easy, Specialization Also Requires Great Effort

Whether setting ambitions or mustering efforts, we must advance along the road of being both red and expert. Being both red and expert, being red through and expert deeply, is not only the road we must follow, but also our lofty ambition. At present, some young comrades believe that: "Being red is more difficult," and "Being expert is easier," saying that "First engage in being red, and after being red for a few years, you will definitely be able to be expert." In the past few years, after a series of political movements such as rectification and anti-rightist movements and heart-to-heart talks, many people have received great training and transformation in politics and ideology, and they realize that "being red" requires a lot of hard self-effort, which is correct. However, is "being expert" so easy? "Being red" is not easy, and "being expert" is also difficult, both of which require great effort. Red and expert are the unity of opposites, which is the unity of politics and economics, the unity of politics and technology, and the unity of politics and business. We must oppose practical people who are only expert but not red and lose their direction, and we must also oppose empty-headed politicians who are only "red" but not "expert." We must pay attention to both politics and science and technology. Some people think that we only need red and do not need expert, which is a misunderstanding. Today, without mastering scientific and technological knowledge, it is becoming increasingly impossible to adapt to the requirements of the situation. We should make such a determination: China with 600 million people, a major country with a long history and culture, must set an ambition to strive to make our science, technology, and culture reach the most advanced level in the world in a short period of time. This requires the efforts of current scientists and the efforts of young comrades.

For the cause of socialism and communism, we must have a large number of scientists, theorists, educators, writers, and artists who serve proletarian politics, not only general "ists," but also "cutting-edge" experts. This is what our era requires of young people. Chairman Mao said to our students studying in the Soviet Union at Moscow University: "The world is yours, and it is ours, but in the final analysis, it is yours." I hope comrades will set great ambitions and muster great efforts.

    青年要有远大的革命理想
    中共江苏省委书记　许家屯
    “志”是时代要求的反映
    我想和青年同志们谈谈有关立大志的问题，“志”这个东西，归根到底，是时代要求的反映。历史发展提出了新的任务，社会就需要能够完成这些任务的力量。这种需要，通过各种方式，反映在人们的头脑里，指出了人们的努力方向，激起了人们前进的愿望，就成为人们的“志”，或说志向、志气。简单地说，志向、志气，是社会存在的反映。什么时代、什么历史时期，要求青年立什么志，什么阶级要求青年立什么志，不论人们有意识或是无意识，他们的志向、志气，都离不开一定的时代的需要，离不开一定的阶级的利益。说明这一点，很有必要。这可以使我们在立志的时候，有一个正确的方向，更加自觉地适合我们这个时代的要求，更加自觉地为无产阶级的利益服务。这是问题的一个方面。另一方面，“志”的实现，也离不开一定的社会条件。远的不说，例如解放以前，在国民党反动统治下，有些青年也立下了进步的、革命的志向，想为国家民族干一番大事业，想为社会进步作出贡献，但是腐朽的经济制度和政治制度，窒息、压抑和毁坏青年的志向。反动统治阶级妄想把人民群众都变成驯服的奴隶，他们采取各种办法腐蚀和消磨人们的革命意志。胡适之流的所谓“少谈些主义”，就是扑灭青年革命意志的一种“迷魂香”。反动派甚至用监禁和屠杀来消灭青年的革命意志。那时候，革命青年的立志和反动统治阶级的反立志，是一场尖锐的斗争。说明这一点，也很有必要。意思无非是希望青年同志们懂得，今天我们所处的社会条件，非常优越，我们应当珍爱这种社会条件，依靠它，充分发挥自己的积极性，为实现革命的壮志而努力。
      青年人应该勇于立志
    青年同志们要无愧于这个时代，应当有“人皆可以为圣贤”的气魄，壮志凌云，站得高，看得远，敢想、敢作、敢为，在平凡的劳动中为党为国家作出不平凡的贡献，敢于攀登科学的顶峰，敢于创造前所未有的奇迹。今天我们的国家需要许多杰出的人材，我们的科学家、理论家、文学家、艺术家不是太多，而是太少；我们要培养大量的人材，不仅要有一般的科学家、理论家、文学家、艺术家，而且要有世界第一流的科学家、理论家、文学家、艺术家；要有今天的鲁迅、李时珍，要有中国的巴甫洛夫、米丘林、波波夫、爱迪生、托尔斯泰、雨果、芬奇。最近在体育界出了世界第一的乒乓球手容国团，他是一个青年，青年当中应该涌现出更多的各个方面的杰出人物。青年同志们要敢于这样提出：我要立志成为一个有杰出成就的人。
    青年人完全应该有这样远大的理想。毛主席在文学艺术上提了个方针，即革命的浪漫主义与革命的现实主义相结合的方针。所谓革命的浪漫主义，就是对革命的前途要有乐观的精神，对未来的新社会要有宏伟瑰丽的憧憬，对创造新世界，要有伟大的理想。我想，不仅文学艺术上应当有革命的浪漫主义，在我们每个人的生活中，也应当有革命的浪漫主义，也就是说，要有理想，要有远大的理想。理想，虽然在尚属理想的当时，事情还没有成为现实，但是经过一个时间，在一定的条件下，经过主观的努力，理想就会成为现实。人与动物不同，人有大脑，会思想，人们通过社会劳动、生产实践，对客观世界的认识逐步深入，对事物发展的规律逐步清楚，人们可以在认识事物发展规律的漫长过程中，凭借对规律性的认识，提出远大的抱负。这种抱负，就是理想，看来它虽然带有不少想像的成分，但是这种想像并不是没有客观基础的，它可以变成现实，它能够引导人们前进，它是人们生活中不可缺少的东西。不能把立志认为就是个人主义
    有些人顾虑，立大志会被别人批评为“个人主义”。其实，这还是没有弄清下面两个问题，即：根据什么样的宇宙观和人生观来立志，所立的志究竟是理想还是空想。假如你立的志不是个人主义的志，又不是空想，人家又何从批评；即使有少数人批评了，又何怕之有。立志，立革命的大志，坦坦荡荡，光明磊落，根本不必有什么顾虑。我们坚决反对个人主义，因为它是资产阶级思想中最突出的东西，是资产阶级人生观的核心。一切为了个人，为了自己，甚至不惜损人利己，这种思想是和社会主义、共产主义思想截然对立的，是和新的世界观、道德观背道而驰的，它只会败坏人们的志气，而绝不会有助于人们去立大志，所以我们要积极防止这种有害的思想对青年人的侵蚀。我们希望每个青年有正确的宇宙观和人生观，在这个基础上立大的志向，为人民作杰出的贡献，而不是为个人的名利作打算，经营一点庸俗渺小的个人利禄。“好男儿志在四方”，应当是志在人民群众的利益，志在社会主义和共产主义事业。光为个人打算，例如为什么“四大件”（金笔、手表、收音机、自行车）而奋斗，那就不能说有什么大志向，而只能说是没有什么志向，甚至还可以说没有出息。但是，人们决不能把一个青年人立志为人民作出更大的贡献，说成是“个人主义”。一谈到“立大志”就联想到“个人主义”，不加分析地把“立大志”与“个人主义”理解为同义语，这无论如何是不科学的，是不合乎实际情况的。当然，今天还有剥削阶级的思想影响存在，如果说所有立大志的人都丝毫没有个人主义，那是不现实的；同时，青年人的社会阅历不多，缺乏实际经验，如果说所有立大志的人都没有空想的成分，那也是不现实的。问题是不要因噎废食，不要因为有些年青人有点个人主义和不切实际的想法，而不鼓励他们立志。事实上，个人主义和不切实际，并不是由立志产生的，相反地，倒是因为有了个人主义和不切实际，立志才立不好。一个人立志，究竟是不是个人主义和不切实际，这都要具体分析，也都是有客观标准的。倘若不是个人主义和不切实际，就不要怕人家批评；倘若是，就要欢迎人家批评。只有经过批评和自我批评，不断与个人主义作斗争，克服个人主义，建立共产主义思想，才有利于立志。反之，个人主义严重，斤斤计较个人得失而不能自拔的人，情绪忽冷忽热，庸庸碌碌，是不能立什么大志的。再说，个人主义如果不彻底铲除，在立志的途程中，也终归会经不起考验。比如，碰到一些困难或挫折，个人主义就会打退堂鼓，使人消极颓丧，放弃原来的志向；比如，稍微有了一点成绩，个人主义又会出来敬酒，使你喝了以后，全身飘飘然起来，踌躇满志，忘其所以，不但会使你停滞不前，还会使你目空一切，掉进虚无主义的泥坑，或者堕落成为反党反人民的右派分子。
    立志不能离开国家的需要
    还有人问，立志和国家需要有矛盾怎么办？提出这样的问题，就反映了还有一些青年同志不十分了解立志和时代要求、社会需要的关系。国家越需要，越有助于青年的立志，从根本上说，并没有什么矛盾。同时，国家的需要是多方面的，绝不会只需要某一门的人材，人们尽可以在国家需要的广阔领域里作选择，“海阔凭鱼跃，天空任鸟飞”，只要你认识了社会发展的必然，你的立志就是自由的。再进一步讲，国家有时会提出迫切的重点的需要，比如需要医生，需要教师，需要地质工作者等等，这只会帮助青年更好地把自己的志向和社会需要联系起来，而不会对青年的志向有什么限制和损害。当然，这里有个个人兴趣和爱好的问题，但是个人的兴趣和爱好也是历史的产物，并不是天生的，也不是不可改变的。对一个革命青年来说，当国家的需要和个人已经初步形成的爱好发生一些矛盾的时候，首先应该服从国家的需要。“国家需要我做什么就做什么”，每个青年人都应该抱这样的态度，这是具有伟大理想和高度觉悟的表现。不这样，全国六亿人口不可能团结一致，你也就谈不上是全心全意地为社会主义服务。这是一个大前提。在这个大前提下，国家统一考虑需要的时候，当然可以尽可能照顾各人自己的爱好，即根据各人的爱好、志趣分配学习和工作；但是也有不按各人爱好而是根据国家需要分配的，这样，人们可以在新的需要下，培养新的爱好，也可以在业余时间钻研自己原来所喜爱的东西。我们党和国家的许多领导同志，就是这样走过来的。他们并非一开始就是政治家、军事家，青年时代，他们有人是搞文化艺术的，有人是学工的，有人写得一手好文章，但是为了革命斗争的需要，他们果敢地暂时放下自己的爱好，从事国家民族迫切需要的斗争，这就是前面所说的具有伟大理想和高度觉悟的表现。在长期革命斗争的年代里，由于种种原因，很多人逐渐放弃了自己原来的爱好，确立了新的爱好，今天，他们很多人已经成为我们国家杰出的政治家、教育家、军事家、外交家、“实业家”；同时，也有很多人对自己原来的爱好一直坚持下来了，例如我们党内有很多领导同志，不仅仅是一个伟大的政治家、思想家，而且在文学艺术上也有很深的造诣。因此，立大志，钻研自己的爱好和服从国家需要，是对立的统一，只要自己处理得当，矛盾是可以统一的。谁如果把个人的爱好夸大到不适当的程度，使自己的志向离开了社会的需要，谁就自觉或不自觉地陷入了唯心主义的观点。其实，按照历史唯物主义的看法，所谓个人志趣，归根结蒂还是受社会存在、社会发展需要决定的。孙悟空逃不出如来佛的手掌心，人们的志向、兴趣、爱好等等，也逃不出社会物质生活条件及其发展趋向的手掌心。
    不敢言志，不敢言大志，不敢作时代的前驱，这不是我们的时代精神，更不是我们这个时代革命青年的精神。
  只有刻苦努力才能实现大志
    但是，有了大志，还仅仅是事情的开始，要把大志变为现实，还要鼓起大劲，勤学苦练，刻苦努力，进行踏实、艰苦和细致的日常工作。中国有句古话，叫做“临河羡鱼，不如退而结网”。一个人，看到满河好鱼，立志要去打起它来，但是他只是天天立志，天天登在河边说“好鱼好鱼”，却不去结网，不去行动，他的大志是永远不会实现的。所以，确定了大志以后，顶要紧的是按照大志的要求，规划自己的行动，鼓起劲来，采取步骤，一步一步地实现既定的大志。
    实现大志，必然要有一个艰苦的奋斗过程。大志，反映一种愿望，它对青年现有的能力来说，一般总是比较高的，也就是说，现有的能力，一般总是还不够实现这个大志，因此要锻炼，要学习，要艰苦奋斗。资产阶级哲学家宣扬“愿望和能力的平衡”，他们的意思是说“要根据能力起愿望”，他们是企图麻痹青年革命和创造的意志。我们说，愿望和能力总是经历着不平衡、平衡、不平衡而发展的。愿望反映一种客观需要和任务，我们不能因为暂时力不能及，就放弃一个正确的愿望和必须努力实现的任务，而是要积极努力，创造条件，使能力提高到足以实现愿望、完成任务的程度，然后再根据新的任务和新的愿望，锻炼新的能力，创造新的条件。这样一个过程，要求我们作不懈的努力，下真功夫去锻炼和提高自己。这种切实的锻炼提高的工作，当然不如立志的时候那样赋有理想的虹彩，那样使人兴奋。但是，不经过数十年如一日的刻苦训练，梅兰芳、盖叫天他们可以演唱得出神入化吗？不经过数十春秋的登山涉岭，李时珍可以写出“本草纲目”吗？不经过经年累月的肌体训练和芭蕾舞基本动作的训练，乌兰诺娃能在舞台上像青云漫卷一般地舞蹈吗？不经过长年不懈的各种体力锻炼，陈镜开可以在最轻量级举重方面创造世界纪录吗？很明显，志有所成，功有所就，都是经过刻苦锻炼和持久的学习得来的。如果不鼓大劲，就经受不了这样一个刻苦的锻炼的过程。
    在锻炼的过程中，经常会碰到的“拦路虎”，就是困难。志向不坚定的，几经困难，就会灰心，就会放弃自己原定的志向，所以我们在实现大志的过程中，对于困难，要有足够的估计，对于战胜困难，要有足够的精神准备。逃避困难，企图温室生长，是算不得有志气的，也是不能真正实现什么大志向的。我们要学习愚公移山的精神，学习许多伟大科学家屡败屡试的毅力，学习无数革命先烈意志如钢、坚强不屈的英雄气概，来完成我们的伟大志愿。总之，要有一股大劲，踏踏实实，败而不馁，胜而不骄，不畏艰辛，不辞劳苦，不抄近路，不沿抵抗力最小的道路前进，而是抱有科学的态度，采取切实的步骤，奋勇前进，持之以恒。
  注意学习前人和别人的经验
    在这样一个立大志和鼓大劲的过程中，我们要循着正确的途径前进，要有正确的方法。从当前青年同志们立志和鼓劲的情况来看，首先值得注意的，是要坚持理论和实践的结合。我们一定要参加生产劳动和政治运动，我们一定要反对理论脱离实际，但是不能因此就否认学习理论和学习书本知识的必要性。关于理论与实践的关系，有人讲理论——实践——理论，这是唯心论，要反对。我们主张的公式是实践——理论——实践。一切真正知识都是从实践经验得来的，但是人不能事事都经过实践，对一个人来讲，有直接经验也有间接经验，而且一个人的知识，多数还是来自间接经验。旧的教育方法是间接经验和直接经验相脱离，我们是提倡两者相结合。在工厂是这样，在学校是这样，在机关也是这样。空气里有78.1％是氮气，有21％是氧气，这对曾经试验过的人来说，是直接经验，但对更多的人来说，是间接经验。这个经验是正确可靠的。又如化学原素，现在有一百零二种，这一百零二种，是经过许多科学家试验确定的，这对那些进行过试验的科学家们来讲，是直接经验，但是对绝大部分人来讲，是间接经验。这个经验也是正确可靠的。当然，并不是一切间接经验都是可靠的，所以我们在学习的时候，要有分辨，要依靠实践来检验。对我们青年来讲，今天重要的是直接的、间接的经验都要学。有人说，只要直接经验就行了，这是个误解。我们不仅要学习直接经验，而且要学习间接经验，学习中外古今许多人的研究成果。要通过实践来认识和检验前人经验是否正确，发展前人的经验和理论，创造新的经验和理论。有人说，不是提倡厚今薄古吗？为什么又要学习前人的经验呢？是的，我们一定要厚今薄古，但是这决不是说不要古。古是人类发展的来源，没有古就没有今。厚今薄古是厚薄的问题，而不是要不要的问题。我们提倡厚今薄古，目的无非是要使古为今用。列宁说过：“只有用人类全部知识武装了自己的头脑，才能成为真正的共产主义者”。所以我们说，既要实践、劳动、工作，参加政治斗争；又要读书，接受前人及别人的经验，这两者不能偏废。
    学习老年人，超过老年人
    其次，还有一个青年人同成年人的关系问题。江苏省扬剧团最近演出的“百岁挂帅”，剧中有穆桂英和儿子杨文广比武一段，当儿子把母亲打下马来以后，全家欢欣鼓舞，反复地讲“一代胜似一代”。一代胜似一代，是人类发展的规律。古人说：“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”，“冰水为之而寒于水”，这个说法是正确的。当然，这也不是说青年人一生下来、不经过努力就可以胜似前代，后生要胜过老生，青年要胜过老年，必须经过艰苦的锻炼和学习，首先是向老年人成年人学习。现在有些青年人对成年人和老年人的关系处理得不够恰当。应当看到，青年人的知识大部分是从成年人和老年人那里学来的，老年人的知识比较丰富，但是年纪大了；还有许多老年人是没有经过锻炼的，思想还没有改造好，立场、观点上还有些问题，他们的经验也有片面的地方，旧的观点也比较多，但是一定要承认，他们的知识是丰富的，青年人要虚心地同时有批判地向他们学习。看来，学是主要的，把本领学过来，在学过来的基础上通过自己的实践来发展提高，就可以超过他们。我们要尊重老年人，对他们的缺点错误，如属于认识上的问题，应当用历史观点来看待，采取尊敬的善意的态度来帮助。只有这样，我们才能学到东西，老年人才能毫无保留地教给我们本领。
  红固不易，专也要作很大努力
    不论立志也好，鼓劲也好，都要沿着又红又专的道路前进。又红又专、红透专深，这既是我们必须循之前进的道路，又是我们远大的志向。目前，有些青年同志认为：“红比较困难”，“专比较容易”，说是“先搞红，红了再搞几年，一定能专”。几年来，经过整风反右和交心运动等一系列的政治运动，很多人在政治、思想上得到很大的锻炼和改造，他们认识到“红”要经过一番艰苦的自我努力，这是对的。但是，“专”是不是就很容易呢？“红”固不易，“专”亦艰难，都要作很大的努力。红与专是对立的统一，它是政治和经济的统一，政治和技术的统一，政治和业务的统一。我们要反对只专不红、迷失方向的实际家，也要反对只“红”不“专”的空头政治家。我们既要注意政治，又要注意科学技术。有些人以为我们只要红、不要专，这是误解。在今天，不掌握科学技术知识，是愈来愈不能适应形势的要求了。我们应该下这样的决心：六亿人口的中国，有悠久文化的大国，一定要立个志气，争取在短期内使我们的科学技术文化达到世界上最先进的水平。这就要依靠现在科学家的努力，要依靠青年同志们的努力。
    为了社会主义和共产主义事业，我们必须有一大批为无产阶级政治服务的科学家、理论家、教育家、文学家、艺术家，不仅要有一般的“家”，而且要求有“尖端”的专家。这就是我们这个时代对青年的要求。毛主席在莫斯科大学对我国留学生的讲话中说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。”希望同志们好好地立大志和鼓大劲。
