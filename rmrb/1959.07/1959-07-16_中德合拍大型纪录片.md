A Sino-German Co-Production Documentary

    A large-scale color documentary (both wide and narrow screen formats), titled after the German poet Heine's verse - "We shall establish paradise on earth" - is currently being co-produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio and the DEFA Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio of the German Democratic Republic.

    This documentary will reflect the common cause and firm unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; it will reflect the glorious task of the people of China and Germany, standing at the eastern and western outposts of the socialist camp, in defending the cause of peace; the film will also depict the close friendship between the people of China and Germany, in their mutual support and cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields, as well as the rapid and sweeping changes in both countries during the ten years since their founding.

    Heine's "Germany: A Winter's Tale" is a poem written under the influence of the revolutionary teacher Marx's thought. The famous line in the poem, "We are already building that paradise on earth," clearly expresses the socialist ideal. This film uses this as its title. The film begins with the friendship activities of the students of the "Wilhelm Pieck" class of Beijing No. 65 Middle School and the children of the German Democratic Republic in Beijing, and ends with Schiller's "Ode to Joy" from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony as a magnificent musical backdrop.

    中德合拍大型纪录片
    本报讯　以德国诗人海涅的诗句——“我们要在地上建立天堂”为题的大型彩色纪录片（宽、窄两种银幕），正由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂同德意志民主共和国德发新闻纪录电影制片厂合作摄制中。
    这部纪录片将反映出以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的共同事业及其坚强的团结；反映出在社会主义阵营东西方前哨的中、德两国人民在保卫和平事业的光荣任务；影片还描绘出中、德两国人民在政治、经济和文化等方面相互支援、合作的亲密友谊，以及两个国家建国十年中的突飞猛进的变化。
    海涅的“德国——一个冬天的神话”是受到革命导师马克思的思想影响写成的诗篇，诗中“我们已经要在地上建筑起那个天堂”的名句，明确地表达了社会主义理想。这部影片就以此作为题名。影片是从北京市第六十五中学“威廉·皮克”班学生同在北京的德意志民主共和国小朋友的友谊活动作为开始，结尾时采用贝多芬第九交响乐中席勒的“欢乐颂”部分成为壮丽的音乐背景。
