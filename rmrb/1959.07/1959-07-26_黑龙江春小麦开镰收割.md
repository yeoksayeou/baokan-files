    黑龙江春小麦开镰收割
    新华社哈尔滨25日电　全国春麦播种面积最大的黑龙江省，一千多万亩春小麦开始黄熟，部分地区已开镰收割。
    今年黑龙江省的春小麦秆高穗实。各地国营农场和人民公社，已经检修好六百三十多台联合收割机和大量的各种马拉收割机、脱谷机以及镰刀木杈等麦收工具。全省今年用机器收割的麦田，将占播种总面积的50％。
    7月中旬，黑龙江省的麦收准备工作就普遍开始。7月12日，中共黑龙江省委、省人民委员会曾发出指示。要求各地争时间、争主动，适时收割，防止损失。全省还成立了麦收指挥部，各国营农场及小麦主要产区的嫩江专区也成立了麦收前线指挥部，加强麦收工作的领导。
    各地还抓紧了整修场院、仓库、桥梁道路和运输工具的工作。各地人民公社的麦收劳动组织，也已安排妥当，并且建立了责任制度。
