　　Song of Xiang Xiuli
　　Chen Fang
　　Xiang Xiuli, a female worker and Communist Party member from Guangzhou, sacrificed herself to save the factory. I am deeply moved by her actions and write this song to praise her.

　　In June 1959, Xiang Xiuli, loving the collective, bravely sacrificed herself to prevent an explosion. She saved the entire factory, destroying herself in the blaze. Xiang Xiuli, you love the collective. When the news of your burns came, hundreds of people lined up at the hospital, volunteering to donate blood and skin to save you. Thousands of letters were sent from all over the country to express sympathy to you. Xiang Xiuli, you deserve such deep affection, the people always love their representatives, which shows the new type of relationship between people in New China. This corresponds to the ancient saying, "If she could be redeemed, people would give their lives a hundred times over." Xiang Xiuli, everyone respects you. More than thirty days of treatment ultimately could not save you. You left the world with the love of your family and the care of your comrades. Your death is so tragic. Your condemnation of selfishness is so educational for our time. Xiang Xiuli, you understand the correct relationship between the individual and the collective, you can handle this relationship correctly, you put the collective interest first, so you can bravely sacrifice yourself for the collective! Xiang Xiuli, you worked as a maid for a landlord in your childhood. After three years of heavy labor, you were finally driven out the door. What an important lesson! The enemy's cruelty tempered you extremely successfully. Xiang Xiuli, after liberation, you threw yourself into the fiery struggle. You learned to make choices at critical moments, valuing the people's cause more than yourself. At the moment when the alcohol in the workshop caught fire, you did not run away but instinctively took on the responsibility of putting out the fire! Xiang Xiuli, you are truly a brave person. You can withstand the test, you can withstand the storm. The fire cannot destroy you, you are eternally alive from the fire. Those who care about personal gains and losses are so despicable in front of you!

    向秀丽歌
    陈放
    广州女工，共产党员向秀丽，毁身救厂，余深感其事，作歌以赞之。 
    一九五九年六月向秀丽，爱集体，英勇舍身，防止爆炸。救了全厂，在烈火中毁灭自己。向秀丽，爱集体。你烧伤的消息传来，有几百人到医院排队，自愿输血献皮来救你。有千数百封信从全国各地送来慰问你。向秀丽，你当得起这样的深情厚意，人民总是喜爱自己的代表人物，这说明新中国人与人的新型关系。这应了“如可赎兮，人百其身”一句古
    语。向秀丽，大家尊敬你。三十余天的医治终于不能挽救。你带着家庭的恩爱，同志们的关怀，一起离开人世。你的死，多么悲壮。你这样鞭挞自私自利，多么对当代有教育意义。向秀丽，你懂得个人与集体的正确关系，你能把这种关系正确处理，你把集体利益放在首位，因而你能英勇地为集体牺牲自己！向秀丽，你幼年作过地主的婢女，三年重劳动之后，最后把你撵出门。多么重要的一课呀！敌人的残酷无情，极其成功地锻炼了你。向秀丽，解放后你投身在火热的斗争里。你学会了在紧要关头进行选择，爱护人民事业重于爱护自己。当车间酒精延烧的一刹那你不是逃跑而是本能地把灭火的责任扛起！向秀丽，你真是勇敢的人。你经得起考验，你经得起暴风雨。烈火毁灭不了你，你从烈火中永生。那计较个人得失的人在你面前是那么卑鄙！
