Wood decay is mainly caused by the attack of wood-rotting fungi and insects. Wood-rotting fungi can be roughly divided into two major categories: bacteria and fungi, each with many species. When wood-rotting fungi invade wood, they absorb cellulose and lignin from the cell walls as nutrients, causing holes to appear in the cell walls, and the wood decays. Some wood-rotting fungi only destroy cellulose, causing the decayed wood to turn brown, which is called brown rot. When rubbed with a finger, the wood easily turns into powder. Some wood-rotting fungi only destroy lignin, and the decayed wood appears white, which is called white rot. This type of decay is relatively mild. Among insects, termites and drywood termites cause the greatest damage to wood.

Wood-rotting fungi and insects have the strongest reproductive ability and cause the greatest damage to wood in environments with high rainfall, high humidity, and high temperatures.

There are many methods to prevent wood decay (usually also including preventing insect damage). For example, completely immersing the wood in water, or not removing the bark and stacking the wood on the ground, covering it with coverings, and regularly spraying water on it, so that the sapwood part of the wood contains a high amount of water and there is very little air in the cells, making it difficult for wood-rotting fungi to parasitize. However, this method is only suitable for water-resistant tree species such as Masson pine and larch. Other tree species cannot be stored for too long. Another method is to peel off the rough bark of the wood and pile it in a dry and ventilated place, so that the moisture content of the sapwood part of the wood is reduced to below 20% in the shortest possible time, making it difficult for wood-rotting fungi to parasitize. There are also many methods of chemical preservation:

    Slurry Coating Method: Apply the prepared preservative agent to the surface of the moist wood. The preservative penetrates the interior of the wood by means of moisture diffusion inside the wood.

    Bandage Method: The parts of utility poles, pilings, posts, fence posts, etc., that are in contact with the ground are often prone to decay. A bandage made of a chemical agent can be used to wrap these parts to prevent decay.

    Hot and Cold Bath Method: Place the wood in a preservative solution at a temperature of 90° to 95° Celsius and immerse it to a partially saturated level, then quickly transfer the wood to a preservative solution at a temperature of 20° to 40° Celsius. Because the inside of the wood releases some air when heated and shrinks in volume when cooled, creating a vacuum, the preservative enters the interior of the wood.

    木材腐朽和防腐
    木材的腐朽，主要是由木腐菌和昆虫的侵害引起的。木腐菌大约可分为细菌与真菌两大类，每类又有许多种。木腐菌侵入木材里，吸收细胞壁的纤维素和木素作养料，使细胞壁出现孔洞，木材就腐朽了。有的木腐菌只破坏纤维素，使腐朽的木材变成褐色，称为褐腐。用手指一捻，木材很容易就变成粉末。有的木腐菌只破坏木素，腐朽的木材呈现白色，称为白腐，这种腐朽较轻。昆虫中以白蚁、象白蚁对木材的损害最大。
    木腐菌和昆虫在雨量大、湿度大、温度高的环境下，繁殖能力最强，对木材损害的程度也最大。
    防止木材腐朽（通常也包括防止虫害）的方法很多。如将木材全部浸在水里，或者不剥去木材皮，把木材堆积在地上，上面加上复盖物，经常往上面喷水，使木材的边材部分含有高度水量，细胞中空气很少，木腐菌就不容易寄生。但是，这种方法只适用于马尾松、落叶松等耐水湿性强的树种，其它树种保存时间不能过长。再如将木材粗皮剥去，堆在干燥通风的地方，使木材边材部分的含水量在最短时间内降低到20％以下，木腐菌也不容易寄生。药剂防腐的方法也很多：
    浆膏涂抹法：将配制后的防腐药剂粘糊在湿润的木材表面上，防腐剂借着木材内部水分扩散作用，渗入木材内部。
    绷带法：电杆、桩木、立柱、围墙柱等与地面接触的部分往往容易腐朽，用药剂制成绷带，把这一部分包扎起来，就可以防止腐朽。
    热冷浴槽法：把木材放在热度摄氏90°到95°的防腐剂溶液内，浸渍到局部饱和程度，然后再把木材尽快地移到摄氏20°到40°的防腐溶液中去。木材内部由于受热时排出一部分空气，受冷时又缩小体积，造成真空，防腐剂就进入木材内部。
