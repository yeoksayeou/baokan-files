    We Need Film Reviews Like This
    Jia Meng
    I had the fortunate opportunity to see a good film that has not yet been released, "The New Story of an Old Soldier," and I was also very pleased to read an excellent film review, "A Dear and Lovable Vanguard." (Popular Cinema, this year's 13th issue, by Huang Mei) The vanguard mentioned in this film review is the "old soldier" in "The New Story of an Old Soldier."

    It's a pleasure to see a good film and then read a good film review. Frankly, for me, there haven't been many opportunities to enjoy this kind of pleasure in recent years. The reason is clear: there aren't many good films, and there are even fewer good film reviews.

    I don't want to talk about this film; I believe more people will discuss it when it's released. What I want to talk about is the problem of too few good film reviews in recent years.

    Film reviews, it should be said, are a very important means of promoting the development of the film industry. The growth and development of progressive Chinese cinema owes much to progressive, lively, and combative film reviews. Good film reviews benefit not only filmmakers but also film audiences. After watching a film, whether good or bad, we always have some feelings, opinions, or ideas. However, as ordinary viewers, we are often unable to express our opinions and ideas analytically and systematically. We feel it's good, but we don't know why it's good; we feel it's bad, but we can't explain why it's bad. In this situation, a good film review that analyzes the film, explains what's good, what's bad, why a certain scene is moving, why a certain segment is dull, etc., will improve the audience's appreciation and artistic cultivation.

    But what kind of film reviews do we often see? There are two categories. One is the perfunctory film review that first introduces the plot summary, then makes a few general remarks of praise, such as the theme is good, and then adds a few innocuous criticisms, such as the protagonist's image is not prominent, the character has no development, etc. The other is the pedantic "thesis" that quotes both classic Marxist sayings and a set of technical terms that the audience doesn't understand. These articles are often more than ten thousand words long, making ordinary film audiences "shrink back in fear" at the sight of their length. The former type of film review is like a "worldly elder," speaking hesitantly, afraid of offending the screenwriter, director, or actors, avoiding the specific strengths and weaknesses of the film as much as possible. Even when it's necessary to mention them, various restrictive adjectives must be added, such as "relatively good achievements," "certain shortcomings," "achieved varying degrees of success," etc. With this type of article, you only need to read the title, not the content, because even if you read it, it won't give you any clear impression. The latter type of article is a bit like a "pedantic scholar" who likes to parrot dogma, speaking tediously, quoting scriptures, profound and erudite, but alas, the reader doesn't understand! Even if this type of article isn't necessarily "bland and repulsive," it is at least devoid of any sense of intimacy for the audience. In addition to these, there is also the "sharp-tongued girl" style, whose purpose is only to punish others and show off oneself with immature and crude criticism.

    Having seen too many of these two types of film reviews, I had a great feeling of appreciation for Comrade Huang Mei's essay-like film review. This article neither narrates the story nor uses terms like "montage." He treats the screenwriter, director, and actors as comrades and friends, and he has feelings for them, so he speaks frankly, with both heartfelt joy and pertinent criticism. And for the audience, this short article—in my experience—reveals a very important truth: the reason why this film is good and moving is that the filmmakers don't get caught up in the plot but focus on creating a few distinct and unforgettable images. I think this is a very important lesson for Chinese cinema. In the past ten years, New China's films have indeed created some lovable and unforgettable typical characters. However, it should also be said that the films that allow us to derive artistic enjoyment from the characters are not the majority but only a minority. Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Water Margin, and Dream of the Red Chamber are all good novels, but among the tens of millions of readers, not many can clearly remember the plots of these novels. However, mentioning Zhang Fei, Lin Chong, or Lin Daiyu immediately leaves a deep impression on people, and their characters are always vivid and lively. Mentioning Chapayev, a clear, vigorous image immediately appears in our memory, but if you ask me to retell the story of the film "Chapayev," perhaps I'm particularly forgetful, but I really can't tell it anymore. In "Dong Cunrui," there is a supporting character named "Zhi Zhenbiao." I watched the film three years ago, and mentioning him is like mentioning an old friend. His voice, smile, and even his physical characteristics are very clear in my memory, but as for the story of the film, I remember the general outline, but the specific details have long been forgotten. If Chinese cinema wants to improve its quality, I think this is a problem that must be solved early in creative thinking, and now, in "A Dear and Lovable Vanguard," the author doesn't talk about "theory" but concisely presents this problem.

    We need film reviews like this. This kind of film review is not only easy to read but also beneficial to us. Although the author says, "It is not very appropriate for people like us who watch movies for a living... to write film reviews," I say otherwise, it's very appropriate, very appropriate indeed.

### 要有这样的影评

    要有这样的影评
    贾萌
    我有一个偶然的机会看了一部尚未公映的好影片，——“老兵新传”，我又很高兴地读到了一篇很出色的影评——“一员亲切可爱的闯将”。（大众电影今年第十三期，荒煤作）这篇影评中所说的那员闯将，就是“老兵新传”中的“老兵”。
    看了好影片之后再看到好影评，这是一种愉快。老实说，对我来说，近年来，能够享受到这种愉快的机会实在不太多。理由甚明，好影片不多，好影评更少。
    我不想谈这部影片，我想这部影片公映的时候一定会有更多的人来谈它。我想讲的，就只是近年来好影评太少的问题。
    影评，应该说，是推动电影事业发展的一种很重要的手段。中国进步电影的成长与发展，进步的、生动而又具有战斗性的影评起了很大的作用。好的影评不仅对电影工作者有益处，对电影观众也有益处。我们看了一部电影，不论是好是坏，总觉得有点感受、有点看法、有点意见。可是，作为一个普通的观众，常常是不能有分析、有系统地把自己的意见和看法讲出来的。觉得好，不知好在何处，觉得不好，也说不出不好的所以然。在这种情况下，有一篇好的影评，将这部影片分析一下，把好在什么地方、不好在什么地方、为什么那一场戏会感动人、为什么那一段戏会使人感到沉闷……等等道理讲一讲，这就会提高观众的欣赏水平、文艺修养。
    话讲回来，我们经常看到的是怎样的影评呢？归纳起来有两类。一类是例行公事式的影评，先介绍一下故事梗概，接着笼统地讲几句好话，如主题思想是好的之类，再笼统地加上几句不痛不痒的批评，如主人公的形象不突出、性格没有发展等等。另一类是学究式的“论文”，既引用马克思主义的经典名言，又加上一套观众看不懂的技术术语，这一类文章常常长达万余言，使普通电影观众一看到篇幅就“望而生畏”。前一类影评很像“世故老人”，讲话吞吞吐吐，生怕得罪了编剧、导演、演员，对影片的具体优缺点尽可能避而不谈，即使非讲不可的时候，也一定要加上各种各样的限制性的形容词，如“有较好的成就”、“有一定的缺点”、“取得了不同程度的成绩”等等。这一类文章，只要看题目，不必看内容，因为即使看了，也不会给你任何明确的印象。后一类文章呢，那倒很有点像欢喜搬弄教条的“迂夫子”，讲话絮絮滔滔，引经据典，深则深矣，博则博矣，奈读者看不懂何！这类文章即使不一定“语言无味，面目可憎”，最少也是对观众毫无亲切之感的。除此之外，当然也还有一种“尖嘴姑娘”式的，目的只在于惩人炫己的幼稚粗暴的批评。
    由于看到这两类的影评太多了，所以对荒煤同志的这篇散文式的影评发生了很大的好感。这篇文章既没有叙述故事，又没有“蒙太奇”之类的术语，他把编剧、导演、演员当做同志，当做朋友，对他们有感情，所以话讲得坦率，既有由衷的欢喜，又有中肯的批评，而对观众来说，这篇短文章——据我的体会——却说出了一条很重要的道理，这就是这部影片之所以好，所以动人，就是电影作者不在情节故事里兜圈子，而只是着力地塑造了几个鲜明的、使人看了难以忘记的形象。我觉得，对中国电影来说，这是一条很重要的教训。十年来，新中国的电影中的确也曾塑造出了一些可爱的、使人看了之后久久不会忘却的典型性格的人物，但是，也应该说，能够使我们从人物性格中得到艺术享受的影片决不是多数而只是少数。三国演义、水浒、红楼梦都是好小说，可是在成万上亿的读者中，能够清清楚楚记得这些小说的故事情节的人并不多，而一提起张飞、林冲、林黛玉，那么，给人们的印象是深刻的，他们的性格永远是鲜明生动的。提起夏伯阳，我们记忆里立刻浮映出一个鲜明的、生龙活虎般的形象来，可是要我再讲一遍“夏伯阳”这部影片的故事，也许我特别健忘，我的确已经讲不出来了。“董存瑞”里有个配角名叫“郅振标”片子看了三年了，一提起他就像是个老朋友，他的声音笑貌、甚至他的生理特征，在我的记忆里是很鲜明的，这部片子的故事呢，大轮廓记得，具体细节早已记不起了。中国电影要提高质量，我看这是在创作思想上必须及早解决的一个问题，而现在，在“一员亲切可爱的闯将”中，作者没有讲“理论”，却把这个问题很扼要地讲出来了。
    我们要有这样的影评。这样的影评不仅容易读，而且对我们有益处。尽管作者说：“像我们这样以看电影为职业的人……来写影评，是不大恰当的”，我说不然，很恰当，恰当得很。
