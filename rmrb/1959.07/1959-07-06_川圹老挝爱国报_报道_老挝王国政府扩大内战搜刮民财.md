Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd dispatch: A report from Khuang, Laos: According to the "Khuang Lao Patriotic News" on June 28th, in the days before June 28th, the government of Phoui Sananikone, under the pretext that the people were supporting and hiding former Pathet Lao combat troops, dispatched many armed forces to conduct "sweeps" in many areas of Luang Prabang Province.

The Phoui Sananikone government continues to expand and prolong the civil war, intensifying "sweep" operations in many areas of Khuang Province. The Sananikone government's troops have wantonly plundered the people's property, forcing them to hand over large quantities of grain and cattle to serve their new military plans. The residents of Tantha alone were forced to hand over nineteen head of cattle and many pigs, chickens, ducks, etc.

On June 22nd, a unit of the former Pathet Lao combat troops was ambushed by the Lao Kingdom army on its way to Bon Mo. The former Pathet Lao combat troops were forced to counterattack, killing one soldier of the Kingdom army and wounding several others. They also captured a carbine and some ammunition.

On June 24th, a unit of the Kingdom army went to a village in the Ba Bian area to conduct a "sweep," and shot and killed people. The people resisted with force, and as a result, this unit fled, leaving behind a corpse.

On June 25th, a unit of the Kingdom army attacked a unit of the Second Battalion of the former Pathet Lao combat troops in the Tan Lang area. After more than half an hour of battle, the former Pathet Lao combat troops repelled this attack by the Kingdom army.

On June 22nd, 23rd, and 24th, battles also took place in Mang Long, Tan Lang, Bon Mon, and Tan Nong.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 3rd dispatch: A recent issue of the Indian weekly "Blitz" carried a report from Vientiane by the newspaper's correspondent, pointing out that the Lao Sananikone government's armed persecution of the former Pathet Lao combat troops and the actions of re-igniting the civil war are "part of the US imperialists' plan, the purpose of which is to crush the Lao movement for democracy and independence, suppress the Lao people's tendency toward peace and neutrality, and drag this country into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." The report points out that the United States is helping the Lao Kingdom government's army and undermining the negotiations between the Lao Kingdom government and the former Pathet Lao combat troops.

    新华社河内2日电　老挝川圹消息：据“川圹老挝爱国报”6月28日报道：在6月28日以前的几天中，培·萨纳尼空政府以人民支持和隐藏前寮国战斗部队人员为借口，出动了许多武装部队，在琅勃拉邦省的许多地区进行了“扫荡”。
    培·萨纳尼空政府继续扩大和延长内战，在川圹省的许多地区加强了“扫荡”活动。萨纳尼空政府的军队大肆搜刮人民的财产，强迫人民交出大量粮食和牛，为它们的新的军事计划服务。只是探达一个乡的居民就被迫交出十九头牛和许多猪、鸡、鸭等。
    6月22日，前寮国战斗部队的一支部队在开往本莫的路上，遭到老挝王国军队阻击。前寮国战斗部队被迫进行了反击，击毙王国军队士兵一名，击伤数名。并且缴获了一支卡宾枪和一些弹药。

    6月22、23、24日三天内，在茫龙、探琅、本门和探农等地，也发生了战斗。
    新华社新德里3日电　最近一期的印度“闪电”周报刊载的这家周报记者从万象发出的消息指出，老挝萨纳尼空政府武装迫害前寮国战斗部队和重新挑起内战的行动，是“美帝国主义的计划的一部分，目的是粉碎老挝争取民主和独立的运动，镇压老挝人民走向和平和中立的倾向，并且把这个国家拉入东南亚条约组织”。消息指出，美国帮助老挝王国政府的陆军，并破坏老挝王国政府和前寮国战斗部队之间的谈判。
