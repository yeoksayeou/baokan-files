Fifteen Years of People's Poland
Ai·O'Habu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party

    Communists Stand at the Forefront of Rebuilding Poland

    Fifteen years ago, the Soviet army and the ranks of Polish fighters struggling against Hitlerism stepped onto Polish soil and liberated Poland from Hitler's occupation and enslavement. Fifteen years ago, People's Poland was born. This event had pivotal significance for the Polish people. The most outstanding figures in our history had dreamed of a Poland where the people held power, and countless freedom fighters and progressives had dedicated their strength and lives to realizing this ideal. This ideal became the guiding principle of the Polish revolutionary movement's struggle. Revolutionaries and patriots had long understood that Poland's fate, its independence and security, as well as the destiny of the people and the continuous development of its creative power, depended on the completion of fundamental changes in the social system, on taking the path of democracy and socialism, and on cooperation and alliance with international revolutionary forces and anti-imperialist forces. The Polish Communist Party during the interwar period, and the Polish Workers' Party during the war years, declared this truth and waged the most resolute struggle for its realization. This truth penetrated more and more widely into all strata of society and gained more and more supporters. The party of the working class, our party, united all progressive forces and stood at the forefront of the struggle to realize the revolutionary program fifteen years ago. The July Manifesto of the Polish Committee of National Liberation was the expression of this program. What was the content of this program? The manifesto proclaimed the people's power exercised by the working class in alliance with the working peasantry, announced land reform, nationalization of industry, and planned development of the national economy. The manifesto proclaimed the liberation and management by Poland of the regained western territories along the Oder River and the Baltic Sea, justly resolved the issues of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, and openly based the alliance and friendship with the Soviet Union as the foundation of our policy. This was the only program. It drew conclusions from historical (and sometimes painful) experiences and pointed out to the people the path to sovereignty, social justice, and rapid economic and cultural development. Only the advanced forces of the people—the working class—could put forward such a program for the real revival of Poland, and only it could unite all truly patriotic and progressive forces to realize this program.

    Could the bourgeoisie and its lackeys do anything good for the people? They could only use empty words and outdated concepts of "God and Fatherland" to bewitch the people, concepts that had been tested in the twenty years of capitalist and landlord rule in Poland. Their government's budget at the end of 1939 was that of a bankrupt. The representatives of the bourgeois government issued many empty checks to evade their responsibility for the miserable state of the national economy; they could not even bring the national economy up to the level of 1913. They also wanted to evade responsibility for poverty and unemployment, for exploitation and oppression of the people, for persecution and oppression of the working class and ethnic minorities, and for a foreign policy that left the country isolated when faced with the aggression of powerful enemies. The September defeat (referring to Hitler's Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939) was a great tragedy for the people, but also a great shock. The Communists and their allies had long predicted the destruction of the fascist government and stood at the forefront of the struggle against the fascist aggressors in the most difficult moments. The course of historical events proved that the Communists and their allies were right.

    Overcoming Post-War Difficulties and Carrying Out Reconstruction Work

    After the war, we began the work of rebuilding the country. As a result of the war and the terror of the occupying forces, Poland lost six million citizens, and more than half a million became disabled. These figures factually illustrate that Poland lost more citizens in World War II than the United States, Britain, France, and other Western allies in the great anti-Hitler alliance. Only the losses and sacrifices of the Soviet Union and China were greater than ours. The material losses were also extremely terrible. About 19,500 factories and enterprises became ruins (calculated based on Poland's current area). Losses to agricultural property reached 35%, and the transportation industry lost half of its property. Compared with the total pre-war property value, the loss of cultural and artistic wealth reached 43%, the loss of educational and scientific research institutions was 60%, and the loss of healthcare was 55%. Compared with other countries, Poland suffered particularly great war damage. The war damage reduced Poland's national property by 38% compared to 1939, while France only decreased by 1.5% and Britain by 0.8%.

    If we take note of the exceptionally backward characteristics of Poland before September 1939, and if we take note of the circumstances in which we began construction fifteen years ago due to the destruction of the war, then our achievements become even more obvious. The Polish people have every right to be proud of their achievements. The tasks that were put forward at that time seemed to exceed the strength and possibilities of our generation. It needs to be emphasized here that before September 1939, Poland was a backward country with very underdeveloped industry, a semi-feudal agricultural country. Based on average population calculation, Poland's national income before the war was at the lowest level in Europe. At the end of World War II, our economic situation was incomparably worse than in 1938 before the war. The initial years after the war were years of rebuilding the motherland. As early as 1948, we reached the pre-war level of total output. When talking about the huge growth of our productivity compared to before the war, in fact, we are only talking about the achievements of the creative labor of our people in ten years rather than fifteen years. Today, when summarizing the achievements of the past years, we can say: These were years of difficulty and arduous labor, but this labor has brought outstanding results, it has multiplied our strength several times, and it has made it possible for us today to point out great development prospects that were unimaginable in Poland's past.

    The Contrast Between Poland Today and Yesterday Shows Remarkable Development

    If we compare our current possibilities and tasks with the situation of People's Poland fifteen years ago, it is hard to believe that only fifteen years separate us. At that time, the urgent task of land reform was put on the agenda. As a result of the implementation of land reform, landless and land-poor farmers obtained more than six million hectares of land. And today we have formulated a huge plan for developing the countryside, socialist transformation of agriculture, and increasing the yield per unit area of agricultural land. At that time, the factory buildings were empty, incomplete, lacked skilled workers, and were fragmented by the war and occupation. And today, we are in a period of vigorous development of socialist industrialization, today we have many large, modern factories and enterprises, millions of workers, a large number of skilled workers and technical engineers, and many industrial sectors that did not exist in pre-war Poland. At that time, the fundamental problem in developing the country was to unify the western territories into the embrace of the motherland and develop these territories. And today, our political, economic, and cultural hopes for the western regions have been fully realized. We have not only rebuilt this region from destruction, but we have also established many new industrial centers and scientific and cultural bases here. At that time, the heart of the entire Polish people—our capital Warsaw—was almost completely reduced to ruins, and today we have not only rebuilt Warsaw, but also expanded this large industrial, educational, cultural, and scientific center. Now, Warsaw is facing a period of further vigorous development. At that time, it was necessary to guarantee Poland's position in new international treaties, but today Poland's position in the world has undergone fundamental changes. We have become a country with full sovereignty, a country with many friends on all its borders. People's Poland's participation in the peaceful and socialist camp and its friendship with the Soviet Union have primarily given us the conditions for systematic and continuous development.

    Profound Changes Have Taken Place in Polish Society Since the War

    If we do not pay attention to the great and profound changes that have taken place in our social structure, social relations, and in the consciousness of our people, then the understanding of Poland's achievements over the past fifteen years will not be very comprehensive. Due to the completion of many revolutionary changes, the working people led by the working class have become the masters of our country.

    Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the working class has shouldered the heavy responsibility of building a new socialist system. While completing this historical task and changing reality, the working class has also changed itself. In the process of transforming the material and technical foundation, the working class has not only grown tremendously in number, the ranks of the working class have increased by about three million people during the period of 1950-1958. Its cultural level has also improved, and its sense of responsibility for the national economy and for the future of the country has been enhanced. During the past few years, the worker-peasant alliance, which has been of decisive significance for strengthening the people's power and building socialism, has been consolidated. A new contingent of people's intellectuals has also grown up. We have created increasingly broad conditions for the broadest masses to participate more and more widely in the management of the country, to truly jointly decide on matters at the central and local levels, and on national and universal undertakings. The forms of mass participation in management are diverse and are constantly enriched and deepened. In the people's committees, in the autonomous organizations of workers and peasants, and in various social and economic organizations, the enthusiasm of the masses is developing, and their role as masters of the country is constantly emerging.

    National income is the best indicator of national development. Before September 1939, Poland's national income, even in its most developed years, did not exceed the level before World War I. But People's Poland's national income was already about 25% higher than in 1938 as early as 1949, while during the period of 1949-1958, Poland's national income more than doubled. The growth rate of People's Poland's national income in the past entire fifteen years has been higher than that of all capitalist countries. People's Poland's national income is increasing year by year now and in the future. This shows that the distance between Poland and highly developed capitalist countries is rapidly shortening. The development of industrial production has played a major role in the growth of national income. People's Poland's industrial output, calculated per capita, has increased fivefold compared to 1938.

    Moving Forward with Marxism-Leninism as a Guide

    The road we have traveled has not been smooth sailing. System reforms and improvements in material conditions have encountered and still encounter many difficulties. We have struggled with the serious resistance of class enemies and with serious subjective and objective resistance. Due to lack of experience, our work inevitably produces errors. However, the strength of our party, the power of Marxist analysis, lies in the fact that we can eliminate errors, we can learn from these errors, and we can continue to move forward towards a classless society. Despite the fact that revisionism completely negates the principles of socialist construction of Marxism-Leninism, and despite the fact that dogmatism ignores the needs of life, ignores national characteristics, and ignores the specific historical conditions when implementing policies, the Party still realizes its boundless loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and creatively applies it to the specific national and historical conditions. We will continue to develop our socialist construction in this spirit.

    Today, the main task of our people is, on the basis of the great achievements of the past fifteen years, to make Poland's development reach such a level through more productive labor that it can be ranked among the most developed countries in the world. The Third Party Congress determined the task, and this task has become the prerequisite for a new decisive stage in Poland's socialist construction. The resolution of the Congress also pointed out the task for the entire nation. Therefore, the task falls not only on every party member, but also on every citizen of People's Poland. In the next seven years, our economic task is to increase the total industrial output value by 80% and the total agricultural output value by 30%. We clearly know that these arduous tasks require mobilizing all potential and utilizing all available forces in our economy. Only through the path of increasing labor productivity can industrial output increase by four-fifths in seven years. This means innovating technology, improving labor organization, improving the quality of production, adjusting quotas and wage systems, and so on. The Second Plenary Session pointed out that the only possibility to complete the extremely difficult task in agriculture is to combine the policy of strengthening the socialist economy in agriculture with the support of farmers for the development of their own economy, and to combine it with the universal development of all collective and autonomous forms of agricultural economy, so that these forms have more and more socialist content. Therefore, our agricultural team movement is of great significance. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to make agricultural teams a mass and universal organization of the peasant masses. The program for developing agriculture jointly formulated by our Party and the United Peasant Party points out that the basic obstacles currently on the road to developing agricultural production are rooted in the backwardness of agricultural technology in our country, especially the backwardness in mechanization and farm building construction, and are also rooted in the scattered small-scale farming economy and the low level of agricultural production in many regions of our country. To achieve the goals in agriculture, on the one hand, requires extra huge funds, and on the other hand, also requires machinery and equipment and soil improvement, and so on. The indicators for developing agricultural production can only be established when they are accepted by the basic laboring masses. As a mass and universal peasant organization, agricultural teams will inevitably become a school for farmers to engage in business activities collectively and autonomously. Machines, as an inseparable property of agricultural teams, and the materials provided by the state land foundation to agricultural teams for collective use, in addition to state-owned farms and production cooperatives, will become the third link in the socialist economy in agriculture.

    To Make People Live Well

    The Third Congress of our Party pointed out the prospects for further improving the standard of social life in the next seven years, and the actual growth of wages and income of the rural population should reach 33%-35%. If we add the progress in housing, transportation, and social welfare construction that everyone can enjoy, we can answer the question: What results will our labor now and in the future obtain? It will certainly not only satisfy the needs of the people, making them say that they live well and are very rich. From many realistic points of view, the possibility of reaching this goal is extremely high. We know that the road ahead will not be smooth, the road will be full of difficulties, and it will require much effort and high enthusiasm. Although the road is dangerous, it is the only correct road, a road that has been tested by the fifteen years of People's Poland's experience, and a road that is being enriched day by day with the wisdom of millions of working people—the masters of their own motherland. This is the basis for our optimism.

    The Socialist Camp is Getting Stronger Year by Year

    As a party that is part of the international communist and workers' movement, and as a country that is a member of the great socialist family, we must make a contribution worthy of the traditions of our people and our working class to the cause of the competition between socialism and capitalism, which constitutes the basic content of our era. The driving force of the development of our country and all socialist countries, and first and foremost the achievements of the Soviet Union in the economic, technical, and scientific fields that have amazed the world, the Great Leap Forward in China's economy and culture, all of these make the balance of power in the world more and more favorable to socialism year by year. We must remember that the economic foundation is the decisive factor in the struggle between socialism and capitalism. The achievements of socialist countries irrefutably prove that the socialist system is superior to capitalism. The example of People's China has aroused the surprise and admiration of working people all over the world. Today, the leaders of Western capitalist countries cannot but pay attention to and recognize the fact that a strong country exists, which in just ten years, thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, has embarked on a path of progress unprecedented in human history from poverty and the oppression of slavery.

    Socialist countries with common goals and ideologies are increasingly developing fraternal cooperation. Extensive economic exchanges and economic and technical mutual assistance are factors in the rapid development of weaker and economically backward countries. More importantly, the unity of socialist countries plays a decisive role in the struggle for peace. The desire for peace, the approval of the coexistence of all nations and countries, regardless of their social and political systems, this is the aim of the foreign policy of People's Poland and the entire socialist camp. The demand for peace and the security of the motherland is the most common desire of the Polish people. All activities of the Party and the government, all activities of the Polish people revolve around this desire. Although some provocateurs in the imperialist bloc create the threat of war, and although there are many worrying phenomena in the international situation, today, in People's Poland, we still have a sense of tranquility and stability. How is this situation explained? First of all, it can be explained by the fact that we do not exist in isolation as a country and a nation. We are strong not only because of our work and huge material strength, we are strong because we exist as an integral part of the powerful socialist camp. Our socialist allies, from the Red River to the Elbe, are nearly a billion people. Common socialist ideas, common concern for forever blocking any path of aggression by imperialism and eliminating the threat of war, this will unite us forever.

    Struggling for World and European Peace

    In the big family of socialist countries, we are an inseparable and equal member. The unity of the socialist camp is the primary principle of our domestic and foreign policy. This is the symbol of our patriotism and internationalism. There are forces in the world that are trying to maintain the atmosphere of the Cold War. This force is trying to maintain the atmosphere of international tension and nuclear armament. This force threatens the security of many countries and nations, and also threatens our motherland and is formulating plans to invade our Oder River, Neisse River, and Baltic Sea territories. Drawing correct lessons from the past, People's Poland should do everything in its foreign policy to shatter the militarist and imperialist plans of West German revanchists. Therefore, our people fully support the Soviet Union's proposal for signing a peace treaty with Germany and peacefully resolving the situation in West Berlin. In the urgent hope of easing international tensions, we have proposed establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the two Germanys. From this same point of view, we support the establishment of the same nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Balkan Peninsula and the Adriatic Sea region. We also support turning the Baltic Sea into a sea of peace.

    The Polish people are eager to build a happy and prosperous Poland with peaceful and creative efforts. Peace is its biggest concern, therefore, it will spare no effort to promote lasting mutual understanding between East and West, and to ensure that the shadow of nuclear war will not threaten humanity. The fifteen years of People's Poland is the best proof that the people led by the working class and its Marxist-Leninist party have made consistent efforts under the conditions of peaceful construction. When we look at the achievements of our efforts, we can boldly say that these are historical achievements.

    Our fifteen years of prosperity are unprecedented in Poland's thousand-year history, and even any of the most favorable periods in our history have not seen such prosperity. Our people are proud of this. Our people have suffered many humiliations in the past, and today they have finally truly gained freedom and independence, and are building a better life, and also know that they will fully enjoy the fruits of their labor. Generations of Polish people have fought for peace, freedom, independence, and socialism.

    Socialism Has Brought Prosperity and Strength

    The fifteen years of People's Poland are a glorious monument to all those who have dedicated their lives to this sacred struggle. The fifteen years of People's Poland declared the great historical truth: Socialism has brought prosperity and strength to Poland. The great patriot and outstanding writer Stefan Żeromski once dreamed in vain that Poland, which gained independence almost a century and a half later, could get rid of backwardness and embark on the road of major innovation under the rule of the bourgeoisie and landlords. In his work "Early Spring", he accused the Polish government at that time, and through the mouth of the protagonist Balyka, painfully and angrily said: "You are afraid of great actions, great changes, you are afraid of changing narrow ideas, afraid of Lenin's courage, that is, breaking the old and establishing the new, creating unfamiliar undertakings. Poland urgently needs great ideals. This is to carry out land reform, establish new industries, and any kind of great action, so that people can breathe freely. But now it is sultry here."

    Poland before September could not, and did not want to take this road. Poland before September stifled the creativity of the people.

    The power of the working people in urban and rural areas has led Poland to a new journey, and this power is most concerned about the welfare of the people. On the road that began fifteen years ago, we have made tremendous and transformational achievements in all areas. The source of all these achievements is primarily the creative labor of millions of workers and farmers who have been liberated from the shackles of capitalism, working for themselves and for the motherland. The source of these achievements is the people's democratic system that has liberated the creativity of the people, and the correct line of the Polish United Workers' Party, which bears the fate of the people and is based on the principles of Marx, Engels, and Lenin's teachings. We have also never forgotten that the mutual fraternal help of the people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia, especially the help of the most powerful first socialist country, the Soviet Union, is the source of our achievements.

    We will continuously strengthen the work of the socialist system that has been established in the city or countryside, continuously strengthen the work of expanding the contribution of our people to the great international socialist theory, follow the universal principles of Marxism-Leninism, strengthen the friendship and cooperation with the fraternal Communist Parties on the Volga and the Danube, the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, the Elbe and the Red River, and strengthen the cooperation and friendship with all countries in our powerful socialist camp, as well as with the progressive and socialist forces in the world.

    人民波兰的十五年
    波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员  爱·奥哈布
    共产党人站在复兴波兰的最前列
    十五年前，与希特勒主义作斗争的苏联军队和波兰战士的队伍，踏上了波兰的土地，并从希特勒的占领和奴役下解放了波兰。十五年前，人民波兰诞生了。这一事实对波兰人民有着转折的意义。我们历史上最优秀的人物曾经憧憬一个人民掌握政权的波兰，无数的自由和进步的战士为实现这个理想献出了自己的力量和生命。这个理想成了波兰革命运动斗争的指南。革命者和爱国者早就明白：波兰的命运，它的独立和安全，以及人民的命运和它的创造力的不断的发展，取决于社会制度根本改变的完成，取决于走民主和社会主义的道路，取决于与国际革命力量和反对帝国主义力量的合作和同盟。波兰共产党在两次大战之间的时期里，波兰工人党在战争的岁月里，宣布了这一真理，并为它的实现而进行了最坚决的斗争。这个真理愈来愈广泛地深入到社会的各个阶层，并取得愈来愈多的拥护者。工人阶级的党、我们的党团结了一切进步的力量，并在十五年前站在实现革命纲领的斗争的最前列。波兰民族解放委员会的七月宣言便是这个纲领的表现。这个纲领的内容是什么呢？宣言宣布了工人阶级和与劳动农民联盟行使的人民政权，宣布了土地改革、工业国有化以及国民经济有计划地发展。宣言宣布了波兰解放和经营奥得河和波罗的海边的西部收复土地，宣言公正地解决了西乌克兰和西白俄罗斯的问题，公开地把与苏联的同盟和友谊作为我们政策的原则的基础。这是唯一的纲领。它从历史的（有时也是痛苦的）经验中得出结论，并给人民指出通向主权、社会正义、经济和文化飞快发展的道路。只有人民的先进力量——工人阶级才能提出这种使波兰真正复兴的纲领，也只有它才能团结一切真正的爱国和进步力量来实现这个纲领。
    难道资产阶级及其走狗们能给人民做些什么好事吗？它们只能用“上帝祖国”的空话和陈旧的概念来蛊惑人民，而这些概念已在资本家和地主统治波兰的二十年的生活中受到检验。他们的政府在1939年结束的预算是个破产者的预算。资产阶级政府的代表们开出许多空头支票来逃避他们对国民经济的悲惨情况的责任，他们甚至于不能使国民经济达到1913年的水平。他们也想逃避对穷困和失业的责任，逃避对人民进行剥削和压榨的责任，逃避对工人阶级和少数民族进行迫害和压迫的责任，逃避对使国家在敌人强大力量侵略时陷入孤立的外交政策的责任。9月的失败（指希特勒德国于1939年9月入侵波兰），对人民来说是个极大的悲剧，同时也是个巨大的震撼。共产党人及其同盟者早就预告过法西斯政府的毁灭，并在最困难的时刻里站在同法西斯侵略者进行斗争的最前列。历史事件的过程证明共产党人及其同盟者是对的。
    克服战后困难进行重建工作
    战后我们开始了重建国家的工作。由于战争和占领者恐怖统治的结果，波兰失掉了六百万名公民，五十万人以上变成了残废。这些数字用事实说明了，波兰在第二次世界大战中比美国、英国、法国以及伟大的反希特勒同盟中其他的西方同盟国失掉了更多的公民。只有苏联和中国的损失和牺牲才比我们大。物质损失也是非常可怕的。约一万九千五百所工厂企业变成了废圩（以波兰目前的区域计算）。农业财产的损失达35％，运输业失掉了自己半数的财产。与战前的财产总值比较，文化和艺术的财富的损失达43％，教育和科学研究所的损失为60％，保健事业的损失为55％。与其他国家比较，波兰所遭受的战争破坏特别大。战争的破坏使波兰的国家财产比1939年减少了38％，而法国只减少了1.5％，英国减少了0.8％。
    如果注意到1939年9月以前波兰异常落后的特点，如果注意到十五年以前由于战争的破坏我们在什么样的情况下开始建设，那么，我们的成就便愈加明显。波兰人民完全有权利以自己的成就而感到自豪。当时所提出的任务似乎超过了我们这一代的力量和可能。这里需要强调，在1939年9月以前，波兰是个工业非常不发达的落后的国家，是个半封建的农业国家。按平均人口计算，战前波兰的国民收入在欧洲处在最低的水平上。第二次大战结束的时候，我国的经济情况比战前1938年坏得不可比较。战后最初的年代是重建祖国的年代。早在1948年我们就达到了战前总产量的水平。当谈到我国生产力比战前有巨大的增长的时候，事实上我们谈的只是我们人民在十年里而不是十五年里创造性劳动的成就。今天在总结过去年代的成绩时，我们可以说：这是困难和艰苦劳动的年代，但是这种劳动已带来了卓越的成果，它使我们的力量得到数倍的增长，并使我们有可能在今天指出伟大的发展前途，而这种发展的前途是在波兰过去时代所不能想像的。
    波兰今昔对比发展十分显著
    假如把我们今天的可能和任务同人民波兰在十五年前的情况相比，简直很难相信今昔只相距十五年。当时，土地改革的急迫事业提上了日程。实行土地改革的结果，无地和少地的农民得到了六百万公顷以上的土地。而今天我们已经制定发展农村、农业社会主义改造、提高农业单位面积产量的巨大的计划。当时，工厂厂房空空洞洞，残缺不全，缺乏技术工人，并且被战争和遭到占领弄得支离破碎。而今天，我们却处在社会主义工业化蓬勃发展的时期，今天我们具有许多大型的现代化的工厂企业，数百万工人，一大批技术工人和技术工程人员以及战前波兰未曾有过的许多工业部门。当时，发展国家的根本问题是把西部土地统一到祖国的怀抱和开发这些土地。而今天，我们对西部地区的政治、经济和文化的希望已完全如愿以偿了。我们不仅从破坏中重建了这个地区，而且也在这里建立了许多新的工业中心和科学文化基地。当时，波兰全体人民的心脏——我们的首都华沙几乎完全沦为废墟，而今天我们不仅重建了华沙，而且扩建了这个大工业、教育、文化和科学的中心。现在，华沙正面临进一步蓬勃发展的时期。当时，需要在新的国际条约中保证波兰的位置，而今天波兰在世界的地位却起了根本的变化。我们成为具有完全主权的国家，成为在自己所有的边境上有许多朋友的国家。人民波兰参加和平和社会主义阵营以及与苏联的友谊，首先给了我们有步骤地不断发展的条件。
    战后波兰社会发生深刻变化
      假如我们不注意到在我们的社会结构、社会关系和在我们人民的觉悟方面所发生的伟大和深刻的变化，那么，对波兰十五年的成就的了解就将不是很全面的。由于完成了许多革命的变革，以工人阶级为首的劳动人民成了我国的主人。
    工人阶级在波兰统一工人
  党的领导下，担负起建设新的社会主义制度的重担。工人阶级在完成这个历史任务和改变现实的同时，也改变了自己。在改造物质和技术的基础的过程中，工人阶级不仅在数量上有了巨大的增长，工人阶级的队伍在1950—1958年期间增加了三百万人左右。它的文化水平也提高了，它对国民经济、对国家未来的责任感增强了。在过去几年期间，对加强人民政权和建成社会主义有着决定意义的工农联盟巩固了。新的人民的知识分子的队伍也成长起来了。我们给最广大的群众创造了愈来愈广泛地参加管理国家、真正地共同决定中央和地方的事情以及全国和全民事业的条件。群众参加管理工作的形式是多种多样的，并且不断地丰富和加深。在人民委员会里，在工人和农民的自治机构里，在各种的社会和经济的组织里，群众的积极性正在发展，他们的国家主人的作用不断地出现。
    国民收入是国家发展最好的标志。1939年9月以前的波兰的国民收入，甚至在它最发展的年代都没有超过第一次世界大战以前的水平。但是人民波兰的国民收入早在1949年已经高于1938年25％左右，而在1949—1958年期间，波兰的国民收入却增长了一倍以上。人民波兰的国民收入在过去整个十五年的增长速度，都高于所有的资本主义国家。人民波兰的国民收入现在和将来也一年比一年增加。这说明了，波兰与高度发达的资本主义国家的距离正在很快地缩短。工业生产的发展在国民收入的增长中起了主要的作用。人民波兰的工业产量，按人口平均计算，比1938年提高了五倍。
    以马列主义为指针向前迈进
    我们所走过的道路并不是一帆风顺的。制度的改革和物质状况的改善，遇到过并且现在还遇到许多困难。我们和阶级敌人的严重阻力作过斗争，和主客观的严重阻力作过斗争。由于缺乏经验，我们的工作不免要产生错误。然而，我们的党的力量，马克思主义分析的力量就在于：我们能够消除错误，我们能够从这些错误中吸取教训，我们能够继续向前迈进，朝着没有阶级的社会迈进。尽管修正主义全盘地否定马克思列宁主义的社会主义建设的原则，尽管教条主义无视生活的需要，无视民族的特点和贯彻政策时的具体的历史状况，党仍然实现着无限忠于马克思列宁主义的原则，创造性地把它运用到具体的民族的历史条件中去。我们将继续用这种精神来发展我国的社会主义建设。
    今天，我国人民的主要任务是，在十五年来的伟大成就的基础上，用更富有成效的劳动，使波兰的发展达到这样的水平，即它可以列在世界最发达的国家的队伍中。第三次党代表大会确定了任务，这种任务成为在波兰进行社会主义建设的新的决定性阶段的前提。代表大会的决议也指出全民的任务。因此，任务不仅落在每个党员身上，而且也落在人民波兰的每个公民身上。最近七年我们的经济任务是，工业总产值要增长80％，农业总产值要增长30％。我们清楚地知道，这些艰巨的任务要求调动所有的潜力，利用我国经济中一切可以利用的力量。只有通过提高劳动生产率的道路，才能在七年内使工业产量增长五分之四。这就意味着要革新技术，改善劳动组织，提高生产的质量和调整定额和工资制度，等等。二中全会指出，完成农业方面极其困难的任务，唯一的可能是：加强农业中社会主义经济的政策要和农民对发展自己经济的支持结合起来，要和普遍地发展农业经济的所有集体的自治的形式结合起来，使这些形式具有越来越多的社会主义内容。因此，我们的农业小组的运动就具有重大的意义。因此，使农业小组成为农民群众性的普遍的组织，是具有头等重要意义的事。我们党和统一农民党所共同拟订的发展农业的纲领指出，目前在发展农业生产的道路上的基本障碍，根源在于我国农业技术的落后，尤其是机械化和农舍建设方面的落后，根源也在于分散的小农经济和我国许多地区农业生产水平的低下。实现农业方面的目标，一方面要求额外巨大的资金，另一方面也要求机器设备和土壤的改良，等等。发展农业生产的指标只有被基本的劳动群众接受时才能成立。作为群众性的普遍的农民组织，农业小组必将成为农民的在自治地集体地进行经营活动的学校。机器，作为农业小组的不可分割的财产，由国家土地基金会交给农业小组集体使用的资料，除了国营农场和生产合作社外，它将成为农业中社会主义经济的第三个环节。
      要使人民生活得很好
    我们党的第三次代表大会指出了在最近七年内进一步提高社会生活水平的远景，农村人口的工资和收入的实际增长要达到33％—35％。如果再加上每个人都可以享受得到的住宅、交通和社会福利等建设的进展，我们就可以回答这么一个问题：我们的劳动现在和将来要获得怎样的成果。一定不仅会满足人民的需要，使他们可以说生活得很好，很富裕。从许多现实的观点看来，到达这种目的的可能性是极多的。我们知道，未来的道路不会是一帆风顺的，道路上会布满困难，需要许多努力和高度的热情的。道路虽然险阻，然而它是一条唯一正确的道路，是被人民波兰十五年来的经验所检验过的道路，是被千百万劳动人民——自己祖国的主人——用智慧逐日丰富着的道路。这就是我们之所以能够乐观的根据。
  社会主义阵营一年比一年强大
    作为国际共产主义和工人运动的一部分的党，作为伟大的社会主义大家庭中的一员的国家，对构成我们时代基本内容的社会主义与资本主义的竞赛的事业，要作出与我国人民和我国工人阶级传统相称的贡献。我国和所有社会主义国家发展的动力，而首先是使全世界感到惊奇的苏联在经济、技术和科学方面所获得的成就，中国经济和文化的大跃进，所有这些，使全世界的力量对比一年比一年更有利于社会主义。我们必须记住，经济基础是社会主义和资本主义进行斗争中具有决定胜负的因素。社会主义国家的成就，无可辩驳地证明了社会主义制度比资本主义优越。人民中国的例子引起了全世界劳动人民的惊奇和钦佩。今天，西方资本主义国家的领袖已经不能不注意和承认一个强国存在的事实，这个强国在仅仅十年期间，由于有共产党的领导，已从贫穷和奴役压迫中走上了人类历史上未曾有过的进步的道路。
    有着共同目标和思想意识的社会主义国家日益发展兄弟般的合作。广泛的经济交流和经济、技术上的互相帮助，是较弱的和经济上较为落后的国家获得迅速发展的因素。而更重要的是，社会主义国家的团结一致在为和平而斗争方面起着决定性的作用。和平的愿望、赞同一切民族和国家的共存，不管它们的社会政治制度怎样，这是人民波兰和整个社会主义阵营外交政策的目的。要求和平和祖国的安全，是波兰人民最普遍的愿望。党和政府的所有活动，波兰人民的所有活动都围绕着这一愿望。虽然帝国主义集团某些挑衅者制造战争的威胁，虽然国际形势中存在许多令人担忧的现象，今天，在人民波兰，我们仍具有安宁和稳定的感觉。这一情况怎样解释呢？首先可以解释为：我们不是孤立地作为一个国家和一个民族存在。我们之所以强大，不仅是由于我们的工作和巨大的物质力量的缘故，我们的强大，是因为我们作为强大的社会主义阵营的一个组成部分而存在。我们的社会主义国家的同盟者，从红河直到易北河，将近十亿人民。共同的社会主义思想、共同关心永远地堵塞住帝国主义的任何侵略道路和消除战争威胁，这将把我们永远地团结在一起。
    为世界和欧洲的和平而斗争
    在社会主义国家的大家庭中，我们是不可分割的、平等的一员。社会主义阵营的团结，是我们国内和外交政策的首要原则。这是我们爱国主义和国际主义的标志。世界上存在着极力想保持冷战气氛的势力。这一势力力图保持国际形势紧张的气氛和原子武装。这一势力威胁着许多国家和民族的安全，也威胁着我们的祖国而且正在制订侵犯我们奥得河、尼沙河和波罗的海领土的计划。从过去得出正确的教训，人民波兰在自己的外交政策中应尽一切力量粉碎西德复仇主义者的军国主义和帝国主义的计划。因此，我们人民完全支持苏联关于签订对德和平条约和和平解决西柏林局势的建议。由于迫切地希望缓和国际紧张局势，我们曾提出了在波兰、捷克和两个德国建立无原子武器区。从这一同样的观点出发，我们支持在巴尔干半岛和亚得里亚海地区建立相同的无原子武器区。我们也支持把波罗的海变为和平的海。
    波兰人民，渴望用和平和创造性的努力来建设幸福的、富强的波兰。和平是它最关心的问题，因此，它将不遗余力地促使东西方之间出现持久的相互谅解，促使原子战争的阴影将不威胁人类。人民波兰的十五年就是一个最好的证明，工人阶级和它的马克思列宁主义政党所领导的人民，在和平建设的条件下作出了一致的努力。当我们来看看自己努力的成就时，我们可以大胆地说，这是历史性的成就。
    我们的十五年的繁荣，在波兰一千年的历史中是未曾有过的，甚至我们历史上任何最顺利的时期也没出现过这样的繁荣。我国人民以此感到骄傲。我国人民在过去曾遭受了许多屈辱，而今天终于真正地获得了自由和独立，并建设着更美好的生活，并且也知道自己将完全享受自己劳动的成果。波兰人民世世代代曾为和平、自由独立和社会主义而斗争。
  社会主义带来了繁荣和富强
    人民波兰的十五年，是所有把自己的生命捐献给这一神圣斗争的所有人的光荣纪念碑。人民波兰十五年宣告了伟大的历史真理：社会主义为波兰带来了繁荣和富强。伟大的爱国者和卓越的作家斯太凡·热隆姆斯基曾经徒劳无益地梦想过：在几乎一个半世纪之后才获得独立的波兰，在资产阶级和地主的统治下能够摆脱落后，走上重大革新的道路。他在自己的作品“早春”中指责波兰当时的政府，他借助小说的主角巴利卡的口痛苦地愤怒地说出：“你们害怕伟大的行动，伟大的变革，你们害怕改变狭隘的观念，害怕列宁的勇敢，即破旧立新，开创陌生的事业。波兰迫切需要伟大的理想。这就是进行土地改革，建立新的工业和任何一种伟大的行动，使人们能够自由地呼吸。而现在这儿却是闷热的。”
      9月以前的波兰不能，也不想走这一条道路。9月以前的波兰窒息了人民的创造力。
    城乡劳动人民的政权，把波兰引上了一条新的路程，这一政权最关心的是人民的福利。在十五年以前已开始了的道路上，在一切范围内我们取得了巨大的、转折性的成就。这一切成就的源泉，首先是由于几百万从资本主义枷锁下解放出来的，为了自己，也为了人民祖国而进行劳动的工人和农民的创造性的劳动。这些成就的源泉，是解放了人民创造力的人民民主制度，以及肩负着人民命运的，建立在马克思、恩格斯和列宁学说原则基础上的波兰统一工人党的正确的路线。我们也从未忘记过，欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家的相互兄弟般的帮助，特别是最强大的第一个社会主义国家苏联的帮助，是我们取得成就的源泉。
    我们将不断地加强在城市或农村中已建立起来的社会主义制度的工作，将不断加强扩大我们人民对伟大的国际社会主义学说的贡献的工作，遵循着放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义的原则，加强同伏尔加河和多瑙河，长江和黄河，易北河和红河上的兄弟共产党人的友谊和合作，以及加强同我们强大的社会主义阵营的所有国家，以及同全世界进步和社会主义的力量的合作和友谊。　（插题是本报编者加的）
