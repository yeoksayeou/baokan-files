    Planned Breeding of Improved Varieties
    The Zhengda Commune in Lianping County, Guangdong Province, is vigorously engaged in breeding late rice of improved varieties. All twenty-seven brigades in the commune have established twenty-seven collective improved seed breeding farms with a total of more than 800 mu of land. Each team has also planned 1,000 mu of land as improved seed breeding plots.
    Although the Zhengda Commune has made some achievements in promoting and selecting improved rice varieties in recent years, it has not carried out planned breeding of improved varieties. As a result, some of the selected seeds are of impure quality, and planting them does not achieve the effect of increasing production. Recently, in addition to mobilizing the masses to carefully evaluate and identify early and late rice varieties, the commune also organized three on-site meetings for the evaluation and identification of improved varieties, attended by veteran farmers, technicians, and cadres, to strengthen the confidence of cadres and commune members and ensure that they do a good job in breeding improved varieties.

    有计划培育良种
    广东省连平县惠化公社正大抓晚稻良种培育工作。全社二十七个大队已经建立起二十七个共有八百多亩土地的良种繁育场，各小队也分别规划了一千亩土地，作为良种培育片。
    惠化公社几年来推行和选留水稻良种虽然有不少成绩，但没有做到有计划地培育良种。所以选留的种子当中有些品质不纯，种植以后不能够达到增产效果。最近，这个公社除了发动群众认真评选和鉴定早晚两造水稻品种以外，还组织了三次由老农、技术员和干部参加的良种评选、鉴定现场会议，使广大干部和社员加强信心，认真做好培育良种工作。
