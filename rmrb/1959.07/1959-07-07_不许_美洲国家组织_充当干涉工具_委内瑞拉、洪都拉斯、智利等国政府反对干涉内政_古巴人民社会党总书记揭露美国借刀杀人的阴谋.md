Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 5th: The governments of Venezuela, Honduras, and Chile all oppose the US plot to interfere in Cuba and the Caribbean region through the "Organization of American States."

According to news from Caracas, Venezuelan President Rómulo Betancourt stated during a speech at the Venezuelan Independence Day celebration on July 5th that he would not allow an "Organization of American States" delegation to enter the country. He said that his government would not allow an "Organization of American States" delegation to investigate the so-called Venezuelan invasion of the Dominican Republic. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Ignacio Luis Arcaya condemned Eisenhower's blatant statements of interfering in Latin American countries on the 4th, and firmly opposed the "Organization of American States" passing any resolutions that would safeguard the interests of the Dominican Republic's dictatorial regime.

Cuba's "Latin American News Agency" reported on the 5th that Honduran President Ramón Villeda Morales announced on the 4th that he opposed the Dominican dictator's request for "the Organization of American States to interfere with the threat of invasion."

Chilean Foreign Minister Germán Vergara Donoso pointed out on the 4th: "Only when American peace is threatened can the 'Organization of American States' intervene. Otherwise, it is interfering in the internal affairs of American countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 5th: Blas Roca, General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, wrote an article exposing the US conspiracy to carry out armed intervention in Cuba through the "Organization of American States." He pointed out that in the imperialist plan to interfere in Cuba, the "Organization of American States" plays the role of justifying and covering up for the interventionists.

Roca's article was published in "Hoy" (Today). When discussing Eisenhower's remarks at a press conference on the 1st regarding the need to carry out intervention activities through the "Organization of American States," and the Dominican Republic's dictatorial regime's "accusation" against Cuba at the "Organization of American States" Council meeting on the 2nd, he pointed out that Eisenhower's statement was like a public notice to Trujillo, and Trujillo immediately requested the "Organization of American States" to intervene in Cuba after receiving the notice.

Roca pointed out that Eisenhower's interventionist statement, Trujillo's provocations in the "Organization of American States," and the defection of the former commander of the Cuban Air Force are clearly interconnected events and are all part of an imperialist intervention plan. The aim is to undermine Cuba's independence and sovereignty, deprive the Cuban people of their right to decide their own destiny, and restrict and eliminate the forces of the Cuban revolution in order to rebuild a pro-imperialist, large landowner and executioner regime in Cuba.

Roca pointed out that the role played by the "Organization of American States" in all these actions is particularly ugly. This organization once shielded the criminal intervention in Guatemala, and supported Castillo Armas and his puppet regime of "anti-communists" to come to power. This organization has never asked about the tyranny and atrocities of some governments in Latin American countries. But now it is interfering in Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua (referring to the "Organization of American States" recently sending investigation teams to the aforementioned countries to conduct "investigations" to create excuses for interfering in the internal affairs of countries in the Caribbean region – editor's note) in order to help the Somoza family (of Nicaragua) massacre Nicaraguan patriots who are fighting for the freedom, independence, and progress of their motherland.

Roca emphasized that the "Organization of American States" has hitherto been a tool for the United States to control Latin American countries, and is an American holy alliance of masters and servant governments against the revolutionary aspirations of the Latin American people. Some say that the meetings of this organization are like twenty mice and a cat meeting to decide on the cat's suggestions and the mice's requests. This metaphor is as vivid and appropriate as it can be.

    不许“美洲国家组织”　充当干涉工具
    委内瑞拉、洪都拉斯、智利等国政府反对干涉内政
    古巴人民社会党总书记揭露美国借刀杀人的阴谋
    新华社哈瓦那5日电　委内瑞拉、洪都拉斯和智利政府都反对美国企图通过“美洲国家组织”来干涉古巴和加勒比海地区的阴谋。
    据来自加拉加斯的消息说，委内瑞拉总统贝坦科尔特在7月5日委内瑞拉独立纪念日庆祝会上演说时表示，他是不会让“美洲国家组织”代表团入境的。他说，他的政府不会让“美洲国家组织”代表团来调查所谓委内瑞拉对多米尼加的入侵。委内瑞拉外交部长伊格纳西奥·路易斯·阿尔卡亚4日谴责艾森豪威尔公然发表干涉拉丁美洲国家的言论，并坚决反对“美洲国家组织”通过任何维护多米尼加独裁政权利益的决议。
    古巴“拉丁美洲通讯社”5日报道，洪都拉斯总统拉蒙·比列达·莫拉莱斯4日宣布，他反对多米尼加独裁者所提“要美洲国家组织干涉入侵威胁”的要求。
    智利外交部长贝尔加拉·多诺索4日指出：“只有当美洲和平遭到威胁的时候，‘美洲国家组织’才能出面处理，否则就是干涉美洲国家的内政”。
    新华社哈瓦那5日电　古巴人民社会党总书记布拉斯·罗加著文揭露美国通过“美洲国家组织”进行武装干涉古巴的阴谋活动。他指出，在帝国主义干涉古巴的计划中，“美洲国家组织”起着替干涉者辩解和打掩护的作用。
    罗加的文章发表在“今日报”上，他在谈到艾森豪威尔1日在记者招待会上关于要通过“美洲国家组织”进行干涉活动的谈话、以及2日多米尼加独裁政权在“美洲国家组织”理事会会议上对古巴的“控告”时指出，艾森豪威尔的声明就像是给特鲁希略的公开通知，而特鲁希略在接到通知后立刻就要求
  “美洲国家组织”对古巴进行干涉。
    罗加指出，艾森豪威尔的干涉主义的声明、特鲁希略分子在“美洲国家组织”中的挑衅、以及古巴前空军司令的叛变，显然是互相关联的事件，都是帝国主义制定的干涉计划的一部分，其目的是破坏古巴的独立和主权，剥夺古巴人民自己决定自己命运的权利，限制和消灭古巴革命的力量，以便在古巴重建亲帝国主义的、大庄园主和刽子手的政权。
    罗加指出，“美洲国家组织”在这一切行动中所扮演的角色特别丑恶。这个组织曾经掩护了对危地马拉的罪恶干涉，扶持卡斯蒂略·阿马斯及其“反共分子”的傀儡政权上台。这个组织对拉丁美洲国家一些政府的暴政和暴行从来不闻不问。而现在却对哥斯达黎加、洪都拉斯、萨尔瓦多和尼加拉瓜进行干涉（指“美洲国家组织”最近派调查团到上述国家进行“调查”，为干涉加勒比海地区国家的内政制造借口——编者按），以便帮助（尼加拉瓜的）索摩查家族屠杀为祖国自由、独立和进步而战斗的尼加拉瓜爱国者。
    罗加强调指出，“美洲国家组织”到现在为止一直是美国控制拉丁美洲国家的工具，是主子和仆从政府反对拉丁美洲人民革命愿望的美洲神圣同盟。有人说，这个组织的会议好像二十只老鼠和一只猫在开会，决定猫的建议和老鼠的请求。这个比喻是再生动、再贴切不过了。
