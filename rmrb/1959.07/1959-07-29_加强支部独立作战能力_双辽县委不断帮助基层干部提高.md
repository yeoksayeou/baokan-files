    Strengthening the Branch's Independent Combat Capability
    Shuangliao County Party Committee Continuously Helps Grassroots Cadres Improve
    (Our dispatch) Since the rectification movement last year, the Shuangliao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jilin Province has continuously strengthened its leadership over the rural Party grassroots organizations. This has greatly strengthened the combat effectiveness of rural Party branches and promoted the continued leap forward of various tasks.
    Last year’s rectification movement enabled the Shuangliao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the vast number of cadres to further recognize the great significance of strengthening the work of rural Party grassroots organizations. On this basis, the County Party Committee, after discussion, promptly made a decision to strengthen the work of rural Party grassroots organizations. Combining this with the rectification movement, it universally rectified the rural grassroots organizations, further improved and strengthened the leading core of the Party branches. At the same time, in order to overcome the bad tendency of some cadres to isolate themselves in grasping production and neglecting political and ideological work, the County Party Committee called on cadres from various departments going to the countryside to help the rural Party branches improve their work. The County Party Committee also frequently discussed the work of the Party grassroots organizations and promptly resolved the common problems in the work of the branches. For example, after the people's communes were established last year, some cadres believed that "the masses are highly organized, and the role of the Party is not significant," thus relaxing the Party's work. In response to these erroneous arguments, the County Party Committee immediately convened a grassroots organization work conference to fully discuss the new situation and the Party's tasks, making everyone realize that: the people's commune is a new organization, and no one has experience; therefore, the Party's task is not reduced, but greatly increased. After continuous education and inspection by the County Party Committee, the vast majority of commune cadres can actively rely on the Party branch to carry out their work.
    In addition to strengthening organizational construction, the County Party Committee paid special attention to strengthening the independent combat capability of the grassroots branches. To this end, the County Party Committee adopted various methods to improve the policy and theoretical level and ideological awareness of grassroots cadres and Party members. In the past year, the County Party School adapted to the characteristics of grassroots cadres and successively trained more than 900 grassroots cadres in rotation. The teaching closely integrates with the central work and the ideological situation of the cadres, striving for theory to be linked with practice, which not only improved the level of theoretical knowledge, but also promoted the current work. The Party committees of various communes also adhered to the system of regular spare-time Party education. Each commune has a full-time cadre who travels around to give Party lessons to rural Party members. Now, all rural Party members in the county can attend Party lessons once a month, gradually improving their understanding of the Party and its policies.
    The County Party Committee also seized the central link of cadres participating in labor to improve the working methods and work style of grassroots cadres. The County Party Committee adopted a combination of leading cadres taking the lead in labor and providing specific assistance to encourage the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres in participating in labor. Since the County Party Committee decided last winter that cadres above the deputy minister level would take turns to go to the countryside to work as commune members for two months, 16 responsible cadres have gone to the countryside to work as commune members. In the early stage of spring plowing this year, the County Party Committee selected ten cadres to form an inspection team to conduct inspections in five communes to help solve the problems encountered by grassroots cadres in their labor. After participating in labor, the grassroots cadres' work became more thorough and down-to-earth, and they were warmly welcomed by the masses. This made cadres' participation in labor more conscious. Now, the good atmosphere of everyone participating in labor and planting experimental fields from top to bottom is becoming increasingly strong.
    In order to further promote the development of branch work, the Shuangliao County Committee successively held two grassroots organization work conferences, focusing on summarizing and exchanging experiences in branch work. The County Party Committee also focused on Wangben Commune to systematically summarize and inspect the experience of branch work, establish a banner, and guide the whole county, which has achieved good results.
    Through the efforts of the County Party Committee and the grassroots cadres, the combat effectiveness of the rural Party branches in the county has been significantly strengthened, and the leadership level of the grassroots cadres has been further improved. Party members can consciously participate in organizational life and closely connect with the masses. New people and new things are constantly emerging within the Party. There are 50 advanced branches, 651 red banner cadres, and 607 outstanding Party members in the county. (Li Shugong)

    加强支部独立作战能力
    双辽县委不断帮助基层干部提高
    本报讯　中共吉林省双辽县委会从去年整风运动以来，不断加强对农村党的基层组织的领导，使农村党支部的战斗力大大加强，推动各项工作继续跃进。
    去年的整风运动，使中共双辽县委和广大干部，进一步认识到加强农村党的基层组织工作的重大意义。在这个基础上，县委经过讨论，及时作出加强农村党的基层组织工作的决定。并结合整风运动普遍整顿了农村基层组织，进一步健全和充实了党支部的领导核心。同时，为了克服部分干部孤立抓生产，忽视政治思想工作的不良倾向，县委号召各部门下乡的干部都要帮助农村党支部改进工作。县委也经常讨论党基层组织的工作，及时解决支部工作中带普遍性的问题。例如，去年人民公社化以后，有些干部认为：“群众高度地组织起来了，党的作用不大了”，因而放松了党的工作。针对这些错误的论调，县委立即召开了基层组织工作会议，对新形势和党的任务进行了充分讨论，使大家认识到：人民公社是个新的组织，谁也没有经验；因此，党的任务不是减轻了，而是大大加重了。经过县委不断的教育检查，绝大多数公社干部，都能主动依靠党支部开展工作。
    对基层支部除加强组织建设以外，县委特别注意加强支部的独立作战能力。为此，县委采用多种方法，来提高基层干部和党员的政策理论水平和思想觉悟。一年来，县委党校适应基层干部的特点，先后轮训了基层干部九百多人。教学中紧密结合中心工作和干部思想情况，力求理论联系实际，既提高了理论知识水平，也推动了当前的工作。各公社党委还坚持了常年业余党课教育制度，每个公社都有一名专职干部，巡回给农村党员上党课。现在全县农村党员每月都可以上一次党课，逐步提高了对党和党的方针政策的认识。
    县委还抓住干部参加劳动这个中心环节，来改进基层干部的工作方法和工作作风。县委采取领导干部带头劳动和具体帮助相结合的办法，鼓舞了基层干部参加劳动的热情。从去冬县委决定副部长以上干部轮流下乡劳动两个月以来，已有十六名负责干部下乡劳动当社员。今年春耕初期，县委抽出十名干部组成检查组，分别到五个公社进行检查，帮助解决基层干部在劳动中遇到的问题。基层干部参加劳动后，工作更深入踏实了，受到群众的热情欢迎。这就使干部参加劳动具有更高的自觉性。现在，从上到下人人参加劳动和种试验田的良好风气，越来越浓厚了。
    双辽县委为了进一步推动支部工作的开展，先后召开了两次基层组织工作会议，集中地总结和交流了支部工作经验。县委还以王奔公社为重点，系统地总结检查支部工作的经验，树立旗帜，指导全县，已经收到良好效果。
    经过县委和基层干部的努力，全县农村党支部的战斗力显著加强，基层干部的领导水平进一步提高。党员都能自觉地过组织生活，密切联系群众。党内的新人新事不断涌现。全县出现了五十个先进支部，六百五十一名红旗干部，六百零七名优秀党员。　（李树功）
