    Daily Necessities Should Also be Coordinated
    Yi Tong
    When coordination is mentioned, people quickly think of the complete production of mechanical equipment, the overall arrangement of main engines, auxiliary engines, and various accessories and parts, etc. In fact, there is also a coordination problem to be solved in the production of daily necessities, the only difference being the scope and complexity of the content.
    For example, the production of a spool of thread, in addition to solving the cotton and yarn equipment, also needs to solve the supply of spools in order to be completely manufactured and put on the market. Another example is the common thermos bottle, in addition to producing the glass liner, it also needs the outer shell, stopper, and bottom cushion to be assembled into a thermos bottle for people to use. Without the production of accessories and parts, even if a large number of glass liners are produced, they are nothing more than unusable semi-finished products.
    Compared with large-scale machinery and equipment, the production of small commodities is of course much easier. However, the collaborative and coordinated production of small daily necessities should not be ignored. At present, generally speaking, the collaborative production of means of production and large means of livelihood has received widespread attention from all parties; however, the collaboration in the production of small daily necessities is often easily overlooked, and even arbitrarily cut off and squeezed out. Therefore, clarifying the importance of the coordination of small commodities production ideologically is an important prerequisite for the development of small commodities production.
    Of course, to fundamentally solve the production and coordination of small daily necessities, it is also necessary to organize collaboration in a guided and planned manner. Because there are many varieties of daily necessities and numerous collaborative relationships, to sort out these relationships and coordinate the actions of all parties, it is necessary to conduct investigations and research to understand the ins and outs of the production process of these products. Only when we have a thorough understanding of the historical, social, and collaborative production situation of related products, and organize various collaborative relationships in a planned way, can we achieve coordinated production and meet the growing needs of the broad masses of the people for daily necessities.
    The relevant departments in Fuzhou City have taken concrete measures to strengthen coordinated production in organizing the production of small commodities, which is the correct approach. We hope that other places will also pay attention to this issue.

### 日用品也要配套

    日用品也要配套
    一桐
    提起配套，人们很快就会想起机械设备的成套生产，主机、辅机以及各种配件零件的统筹安排等等。其实，日用品的生产也有配套问题需要解决，不同的仅是范围广窄和内容繁简而已。
    例如，一个线团的生产，除了解决棉花和纱线设备以外，还需解决线轴的供应，才能完善地出厂上市。又如常见的热水瓶，除了生产瓶胆外，还要有瓶壳、瓶塞、瓶垫等件，才能配成一个热水瓶供人应用。没有配件零件的生产，即使瓶胆生产得很多很多，也不过是不能使用的半成品罢了。
    跟大型机械大型设备比起来，小商品的生产当然容易得多。然而解决日用小商品协作配套生产也不应忽视。目前，一般说来，对于生产资料和大的生活资料等协作生产迅速配套，已经受到各方面的普遍重视；可是，对于小的日用品生产的协作则经常容易被人们所忽视，甚至被人们随便砍断和挤掉，因此，从思想上明确小商品配套的重要性，是发展小商品生产的一个重要前提。
    当然，要从根本上解决日用小商品的生产和配套问题，还需要有领导有计划地组织协作。由于日用品品种繁多，协作关系千头万绪，清理这些关系，使各方面协调行动，要调查研究，摸清这些产品生产过程中的来龙去脉，只有在我们对有关产品的历史的、社会的和协作配套等生产情况了如指掌，有计划把各种协作关系组织起来，我们才能够做到配套生产，满足广大人民日益增长着的对日用品的需要。
    福州市有关部门，在组织小商品生产中，采取具体措施加强配套生产这个做法是正确的。我们希望其他地方也能注意这个问题。
