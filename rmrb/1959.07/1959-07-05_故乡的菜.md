　　Hometown Vegetables
　　Yang Yi
　　In a People's Daily article, I suddenly discovered the name of my hometown. The article had a vivid title: "Evergreen Huai'an City."
　　To be honest, I had long forgotten my birthplace. If something happens to remind me of it, it's just like a wisp of smoke. I left my hometown when I was a child of about ten, and I knew almost nothing except for the small world of my family. For more than twenty years, my hometown in my memory has been like Rongbaozhai stationery, weathered and faded, leaving only a faint trace.
　　But today, this article so strongly stirs my heartstrings. On this midsummer night, I can't help but feel a rare surge of homesickness.
　　The article is about the vegetable production of Huai'an City. The so-called "evergreen" refers to the continuous supply of fresh vegetables throughout the four seasons of the year. Reading it, I, who am far away from my hometown, seem to smell the fragrance of rapeseed flowers. It's as if I'm back more than twenty years ago, admiring the charming vegetable scenery in those vegetable gardens.
　　I remember one summer morning, my cousin and I hurried back to the city from my aunt's house in Xiahe Town in the northern suburbs. From Xiahe Town to the city, it was about twenty *li*, and these twenty *li* were almost entirely continuous vegetable fields. Although my cousin was only two years older than me, he was a very knowledgeable person in my eyes. Not to mention anything else, he could name all the many vegetables; his family lived near Shaohu Lake in the city, and they also had vegetable fields and raised a lot of chickens and ducks. At that time, city residents grew vegetables to slightly reduce the burden of life as a subsidy, and managing that little vegetable plot also required a lot of effort.
　　My cousin pointed out along the way: "This is beetroot." "Look, this is *pu'er* vegetable."
　　"And what is this?"
　　"Hey, you don't even know *mei dou*!"
　　*Mei dou* is what is called "green beans" elsewhere, and what northerners call "flat beans."
　　He said many other vegetables, but I can't remember them today, and even at the time, I heard them and forgot them.
　　This can be regarded as a relatively clear childhood memory that I still have. In this picture, what occupies an important position is the endless and unrecognizable vegetable fields.
　　More than twenty years have passed, experiencing earth-shattering changes, and the vegetable fields of my hometown have a new life, which is even more attractive. How much has its variety increased? The article does not have any figures in this regard. I remember that more than twenty years ago, my hometown did not have tomatoes and potatoes, let alone grow them; but now, according to that article, tomatoes can also appear on the streets in winter. The people of my hometown, with their hardworking hands and meticulous minds, have added so much color to the vegetable gardens all over the city!
　　Today, as our Party Central Committee calls on cities to be self-reliant and strive for external assistance to strengthen the supply of non-staple foods, I think of the vegetables in my hometown for a reason. Hometown, let me salute you from afar, salute the hardworking and wise people of my hometown, and salute your spirit of collaboration in sending vegetables from thousands of *li*. The Grand Canal will soon be repaired. It won't be long before the vegetables of my hometown can be shipped from the Ximen wharf, winding north, so that the people of the capital can also taste the freshness, and let your children far away from you taste the taste of hometown vegetables that they have been separated from for more than twenty years. "Is it beautiful or not, the water in the hometown," let alone the evergreen vegetables?

    故乡的菜
    杨依
    在人民日报上的一篇通讯里，突然发现故乡的名字。那篇通讯有个生动的题目：四季常青的淮安城。
    说实话，我对自己的生长地，早就忘怀了。偶然被一件什么事情联想起，也只是像一缕轻烟。我离开故乡的时候，是一个十岁左右的孩子，除了家庭里的小天地以外，几乎什么也不知道。二十多年来，故乡在记忆里，就像荣宝斋的信笺，经历了风吹日晒，早就褪了色，只剩了一层淡淡的痕迹了。
    然而今天，这篇通讯却如此强烈地撩拨着我的心弦。在这仲夏夜，我不禁浮起一阵很少有过的乡思。
    那篇通讯，是写淮安城的蔬菜生产的。所谓“四季常青”，是指一年春夏秋冬四季，新鲜的蔬菜供应不断。读着读着，我这个远离故乡的人也仿佛闻到一阵阵扑鼻而来的菜花香。仿佛又回到二十多年前，在那一片片菜园里，领略起迷人的菜景了。
    我想起一个夏天的清晨，我同一个表哥从北郊河下镇姨母家赶早路回城。从河下镇到城里，大约二十里路，这二十里路，几乎全是连绵不断的菜田。我的表哥虽只比我大两岁，在我眼里却成了一个十分博学的人。不说别的，那许多菜的名字，他都叫得出；他家就住在城里勺湖附近，也有菜田，还养了不少鸡鸭。那时候，城里的居民种菜，也无非是略为减轻生活重担的一种补贴，经营那一点点菜地，也是赔上许多心血的。
    我的表哥一路指点着：“这就是披头菜。”“你看，这是蒲儿菜。”
    “这又是什么呢？”
      “嗐，梅豆你也不晓得！”
    梅豆，就是外地叫作四季豆，北方人称之为扁豆的。
    他还说了许多别的菜，不说今天想不起，就是当时，听过也忘了。
    这算是现在还能记得比较清晰的童年的记忆。在这一幅画面里，占重要地位的，是那看不完、认不尽的菜田。
    事隔二十多年，经历翻天复地的变化，故乡的菜田有了新的生命，它更加吸引人了。它的品种又增加了多少？通讯里没有这方面的数字。我记得二十多年前，故乡还吃不到西红柿和土豆，更不用说种了；而现在，据那篇通讯里讲，在冬天的街头，也能出现西红柿。故乡人，用他们勤劳的双手和精细的心思，为满城的菜园增添了多少色彩！
    今天，正当我们的党中央号召城市自力更生、力争外援加强副食品供应问题的时候，我想起故乡的蔬菜是不为无因的。故乡啊，让我在远方向您致意，向勤劳、智慧的故乡人致意，向你们的千里送青菜的协作精神致意。大运河快修好了，不用等很久，故乡的菜就可以从西门码头上船，逶逦北来，让首都的人也能尝尝新鲜，让你的远离身边的孩子再尝尝阔别了二十多年的故乡菜的滋味。“美不美，乡中水”，何况是四季常青的菜呢？
