Gansu Daily News: Across the thousand *li*, rolling waves of wheat, the harvest stirs the heart. The summer harvest army of nineteen counties and cities in Gansu Province is wielding its weapons in a great battle with the wheat sea, joyfully welcoming the first harvest after communization.

Currently, the tide of wheat harvesting is rapidly spreading across Longnan and Longdong. All counties and cities in the Tianshui and Pingliang Special Zones, as well as parts of Min County, Lintao, Longdie, and Linxia City, have mobilized over 400,000 troops to join the battle in the wheat sea. As of June 25th, over 1.38 million *mu* of summer fields have been reaped, including over 1.273 million *mu* of wheat, 81,000 *mu* of winter rapeseed, and 25,000 *mu* of summer coarse grains. Wen County, which began harvesting earliest, has already reaped 25,470 *mu* of wheat, and about 50% of the summer coarse grains, with broad beans already completely harvested. Huicheng County has harvested over 239,000 *mu* of wheat and threshed over 100,000 *mu*.

Due to the diligent implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture by the broad masses of farmers across the province, the establishment of a wheat archive management system, and especially under the direct promotion of the rectification movement, summer field management has been strengthened, and a tenacious struggle has been waged against natural disasters. The summer-ripening crops in both mountainous and plain areas are growing excellently. As the sickle rises, wheat stacks become mountains. According to the good news reported from various locations based on actual harvesting and threshing, summer field yields have greatly increased compared to last year. The good news of the bumper harvest encourages the broad masses of farmers, and the summer harvest work truly achieves simultaneous reaping, transportation, threshing, and storage.

According to Ningxia Daily News: From south to north in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the fragrance of wheat is everywhere, and a bumper harvest is in sight. The region's 2.12 million *mu* of spring wheat are about to ripen. The first summer harvest after communization will soon begin. All counties, cities, communes, and production teams are intensifying preparations, waiting for the opportune moment to wield their sickles and seize the harvest.

While comprehensively studying and deploying summer harvest preparations, the Party organizations of many communes and brigades across the region are focusing their efforts on ideological education. The Honghua Commune Party Committee in Yinchuan City decided to organize a debate on "Should we strive for every grain to return home? How can we ensure that every grain returns home?" in response to the thinking of some commune members that "harvesting quickly prevents harvesting well." Members of the Xinmin Brigade of the Qianjin Commune in Pingluo County have established a summer harvest pact, guaranteeing to be careful in every step and to ensure that every grain is stored. The Mataigou Commune Party Committee in Taole County also held a commune-wide broadcast mobilization meeting, educating commune members to intensify preparations, to ensure simultaneous drying and stacking, to rush threshing during sunny days, to thresh cleanly, shake cleanly, winnow cleanly, and sweep cleanly, so that the wheat stalks do not carry grains and the wheat ears do not carry kernels.

While conducting ideological education to ensure that every grain returns home, the summer harvest headquarters of each county and commune are closely focused on the manufacturing, reforming, supplementing, and repairing of summer harvest tools, preparing and inspecting earlier and better than in previous years.

Communes and production teams are comprehensively planning labor allocation, ensuring that more than 80% of the labor force can be concentrated during the summer harvest, and making every effort to rush the harvest. (Attached picture)

    甘肃十九县市农民大战麦海
    宁夏加紧准备迎接公社化后的第一个麦收
    甘肃日报消息　千里滚滚麦浪，丰收激动人心，甘肃全省十九个县、市的夏收大军，正在挥戈大战麦海，喜迎公社化后的第一个丰收。
    现在，收麦浪潮很快漫卷陇南、陇东。天水、平凉两个专区的所有县、市，以及岷县、临洮、龙迭、临夏市的部分地区，已有四十多万大军投入麦海大战。截至6月25日，已抢收夏田一百三十八万多亩，其中小麦一百二十七万三千多亩，冬油菜八万一千多亩，夏杂粮二万五千多亩。收割最早的文县，已收小麦二万五千四百七十多亩，夏杂粮已收了50％左右，蚕豆已经收完。徽成县收割了小麦二十三万九千多亩，并且打碾了十万多亩。
    由于全省广大农民认真贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，建立小麦档案管理制度，特别是在整社工作的直接推动下，加强了夏田管理，和自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，山地平川的夏熟作物，生长都很出色，镰刀起处，麦垛成山。根据各地实收实打传报的喜讯，夏田产量都较去年大有提高。丰收的喜讯激励着广大农民，夏收工作真正做到了边收、边运、边打碾、边入仓。
    据宁夏日报消息　宁夏回族自治区由南到北，到处麦香，丰收在望。全区二百十二万亩春小麦，即将黄熟。公社化后的第一个夏收，很快就要开始了。各县市、公社、生产队，正在加紧准备，单等时机一到，就挥镰上阵，夺取丰收。
    全区很多公社和大队的党组织在全面研究和布置夏收准备的同时，集中力量大抓思想教育。银川市红花公社党委决定针对一些社员“要收快就不能收好”的思想，组织一次“应不应该颗粒还家？怎样才能做到颗粒还家”的辩论。平罗县前进公社新民大队社员订立了夏收公约，保证做到步步留心，粒粒归仓。陶乐县马太沟公社党委还举行了全社广播动员大会，教育社员加紧准备，做到边晒边堆，抢晴碾打，碾净、抖净、扬净、扫净，麦秆不带颗，麦穗不带粒。
    在进行颗粒还家的思想教育同时，各县和各公社的夏收指挥部紧抓夏收工具的制造、改革、添置和修理，边准备，边检查，比往年做得早，做得好。
    各公社和生产队正全面规划劳力，保证夏收时能集中80％以上的劳力，全力突击抢收。（附图片）
