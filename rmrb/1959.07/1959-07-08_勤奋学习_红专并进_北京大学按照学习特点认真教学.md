Diligent Study, Redness and Expertise
Peking University Teaches Conscientiously According to Learning Characteristics

(From China Youth Daily) Under the leadership and education of the Party committee, more than 9,000 students at Peking University have clarified their learning direction and enhanced their learning enthusiasm. Student cadres have also improved their working methods and taken the lead in studying their lessons well. Currently, the atmosphere of diligent study is very strong throughout the university. Students work hard and study step by step according to the laws of learning. The number of reference books read is increasing; in the study of political theory courses, the proportion of reading classic works has increased. The liberal arts departments, in conjunction with course teaching, conduct classroom discussions and academic thematic discussions, where everyone can freely debate and learn from each other on the basis of individual research.

After Peking University held a teaching work conference in March, the Party committee made it clear to all students that the school is currently in a new stage of shifting from the past vigorous political movements to focusing on teaching and deeply developing the education revolution. The Party committee called on students to study hard and strive for a triple harvest of learning, labor, and ideology. Since then, many students have begun to study diligently and work hard. However, some students are not clear about their understanding, and they cannot distinguish the boundary between "studying hard" and "individualism." Some say, "It is difficult to be both red and expert," and "I am only afraid of not being red, not afraid of not being expert." Especially some student cadres are afraid that emphasizing learning will lead to neglecting politics. They spend too much time on social work and various activities. They also do not make good use of their study time; many people have too many extracurricular activities, which results in the quality of learning not being improved.

In response to this situation, the Peking University Party Committee once again conducted ideological education for student cadres and the majority of students in May. More than 1,000 student cadres, after listening to the report of Lu Ping, the first secretary of the Party committee, and after studying and discussing, clarified the current situation of the school and the important significance of improving the quality of teaching, and reversed the idea of not daring to emphasize learning; they realized that the way of working must change with the development of the situation and the different content, and it is necessary to improve work efficiency and work quality. In particular, they clarified that the Party's requirement for them is to be both red and expert, and that they must not only do a good job in the social work assigned by the organization, but also strive to study their lessons well.

After the student cadres improved their ideological understanding, their enthusiasm for learning greatly increased, and they all wanted to do well in their studies. Under the leadership and specific help of the Party branch general in each department, they studied and improved their working methods: First, they strengthened the work of the Communist Youth League branch, and under the leadership of the Party branch, concentrated on grasping political and ideological work, conducted more investigations and research, and specifically solved major ideological problems; at the same time, they clarified that the class leader and the class representative should do a good job in organizing learning; the class meetings should mainly manage entertainment, sports, and life. Many classes originally had many organizational structures set up under the Communist Youth League branch and class meetings, which were complex in form and overlapping in levels, resulting in excessive activities. This has now been changed. Second, attention is paid to quality and effectiveness when carrying out various activities and holding meetings, emphasizing clear goals and sufficient preparation. Recently, the Communist Youth League organizations of many classes, in response to the students' insufficient understanding of the importance of their majors and their lack of perseverance in overcoming difficulties, have carried out some activities, inviting comrades and teachers from practical work departments to specifically introduce why to study and how to study well, and the effect is very good. According to the regulations of the Party committee, various meetings and activities do not occupy Saturday evenings, Sunday daytime, and weekday sleep time. Party and League organizational life is generally twice a month, with criticism and self-criticism as the main content. Third, adjustments have been made to class wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, special publications, and broadcasts, and each department will concentrate on running one wall newspaper well. Other activities such as entertainment, sports, and hygiene emphasize actively guiding students to participate consciously.

After these improvements, extracurricular activities closely cooperate with teaching, ideological work is more practical and solves problems, the quality is greatly improved, and the number of times is reduced accordingly. The social work time of student cadres has decreased to ten hours per week, and the social activities and class meetings and organizational life time of the majority of students have also decreased to four or five hours, which greatly guarantees study time. Extracurricular free activities can also be freely arranged according to individual needs, and both lunch breaks and nighttime sleep are sufficient, so that study and leisure life can be carried out rhythmically.

    勤奋学习　红专并进
    北京大学按照学习特点认真教学
    据中国青年报消息　北京大学九千多同学在党委的领导和教育下，明确了学习方向，提高了学习积极性；学生干部也改进了工作方法，带头学好功课。目前全校勤奋学习的风气十分浓厚，同学们按照学习的规律刻苦努力，循序渐进地进行学习。阅读参考书籍的数量愈来愈大；政治理论课的学习，增多了阅读经典著作的比重。文科各系结合课程教学，开展一些课堂讨论和学术性的专题讨论，大家都能在个人钻研的基础上，自由争辩，取长补短。
    北京大学在3月召开了教学工作会议后，党委向全校同学明确指出：当前学校是处在由过去轰轰烈烈的政治运动，转为以教学为主，深入发展教育革命的新阶段。党委号召同学们努力读书，争取学习、劳动、思想三丰收。此后，许多同学开始刻苦钻研，勤奋学习。但是有些同学认识不清楚，他们划不清“好好读书”和“个人主义”的界线，有的说“红难专易”，“只怕不红，不怕不专”。尤其是部分学生干部，怕强调了学习，会产生忽视政治的倾向。他们把过多的时间放在社会工作和各项活动上。学习时间也抓得不紧；不少人课外活动过多，结果不能使学习质量提高。
    针对这一情况，北大党委5月间再一次向学生干部和广大同学进行了思想教育。一千多名学生干部在听了党委第一书记陆平同志的报告后，经过学习讨论，明确了学校的当前形势和提高教学质量的重要意义，扭转了不敢强调学习的思想；认识到工作方式方法要随着形势的发展和内容的不同而变化，需要提高工作效率和工作质量。特别是明确了党对自己的要求是又红又专，既要做好组织交给的社会工作，更要努力学好功课。
    学生干部提高了思想认识后，学习积极性大为高涨，都想把学习搞好。在各系党总支的领导和具体帮助下，他们研究改进了工作方法：第一，加强了团支部工作，在党支部领导下，集中精力抓政治思想工作，多作调查研究，具体解决主要思想问题；同时明确班长和课代表做好学习方面的组织工作；班会多管文娱体育和生活等方面的工作。原来许多班级在团支部和班会之下，还设立了不少组织机构，形式庞杂，层次重叠，造成了活动过多的现象，现在也得到了改变。第二，在开展各项活动和举行会议时都注意讲究质量和效果，强调目的明确，准备充分。最近许多班级的团组织，针对同学们对自己所学专业的重要性认识不足，克服困难的毅力不够等情况，分别开展了一些活动，请实际工作部门的同志和老师具体介绍为什么要学和如何学好，效果很好。按照党委的规定，各种会议和活动都不占用星期六晚上、星期日白天和平日的睡眠时间。党团组织生活一般是每月两次，以开展批评和自我批评为主要内容。第三，对班级墙报、黑板报、专刊、广播等均作了调整，由各系集中办好一个墙报。其他如文娱体育卫生等活动，都强调积极引导同学们自觉参加。
    经过这些改进，课外各项活动紧密配合教学，思想工作更加切合实际而解决问题，质量大大提高，次数相应减少。学生干部的社会工作时间每周下降到十小时，广大同学的社会活动和班会、组织生活时间也减少到四五小时，大大保证了学习时间。课外自由活动，也多能根据个人需要自由支配，午睡和夜晚的睡眠都很充足，使学习和课余生活都能有节奏地进行。（附图片）
