Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Tokyo Radio reported that the Japanese Supreme Court announced today that it will deliver the verdict on the "Matsukawa Incident" on August 10th.

The Japanese people are vigilantly watching the reactionaries' final conspiracy to frame those Japanese patriotic workers who have been unjustly imprisoned for ten years. The "Matsukawa Incident Countermeasures Council" and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held a joint meeting today and decided to launch a massive movement to strive for the acquittal of all defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." First, they plan to initiate a large-scale march in support of the "Matsukawa Incident defendants" starting from Numazu, Kofu, Mito, Choshi, and other places on August 5th and 6th, heading towards Tokyo. The marching队伍 will arrive in Tokyo on August 10th.

On the day of the final trial, the Japanese people are prepared to hold simultaneous support rallies across the country. In Tokyo, a central rally with 20,000 participants will be held to fight for the acquittal of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Tokyo News: Fukushima City, Japan, held a "Rally to Defend the Defendants of the Matsukawa Incident" on the evening of the 25th. More than a thousand citizens who participated in the rally unanimously demanded that the Supreme Court declare all defendants innocent.

Fukushima City is the location where the "Matsukawa Incident," in which Japanese and American reactionaries fabricated persecution against Japanese patriotic workers ten years ago, took place.

The rally passed a resolution demanding that the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office severely punish those involved in the "Matsukawa Incident."

The rally also passed a resolution expressing its determination to resolutely prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and to support the Tokyo District Court's ruling on the "Sunagawa Incident."

At the meeting, nineteen innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" and the famous writer Hirotsu Kazuo, who has been working for ten years to strive for the acquittal of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," spoke.

Okabayashi Tatsuo, the chief lawyer of the "Matsukawa Incident" defense team, and Hirotsu Kazuo, the chairman of the "Matsukawa Incident Countermeasures Association," issued statements on the 27th. They unanimously pointed out that if the Supreme Court could conduct a fair trial, they believe that all defendants would be acquitted. Hirotsu also demanded that the Supreme Court make a fair judgment based on the law and evidence. (Picture attached)
