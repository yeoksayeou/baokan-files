This newspaper Jinan, 14th dispatch: Shandong Province's Wulian County, this year, while obtaining the first great agricultural harvest since communization, also frequently reports successes in diversified economic production centered on pigs, poultry, fruits, etc., with a sharp increase in income. Currently, this mountainous area, once known for its barrenness, has a new look, with beautiful mountain scenery, presenting a prosperous and happy scene of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery everywhere.

This year's summer harvest in Wulian County is better than any previous year. Last year, the county's average wheat yield was 135 jin per mu, and this year it is 180 jin per mu. The county, which used to lack grain, improved its situation last year, not only becoming self-sufficient but also selling 44.6 million jin of surplus grain. This year's harvest is even better than last year. So far, 91% of the 10 million jin summer grain procurement task has been completed.

The development of diversified economies is even more significant this year. According to statistics from January to June: the county's pig stock reached 180,000 heads, an increase of more than 56% from the 115,000 heads at the end of last year; 1,940 head of draft cattle were bred; the poultry industry, including chickens and ducks, has grown from 163,400 last year to 573,900, an increase of two and a half times, with an average of more than seven per household for the county's 80,000 households; the emerging fish farming industry has also increased from 700,000 last year to 1.7 million. In the past six months, tussah silk production has doubled compared to the same period last year, and beekeeping has increased by 76%. The entire livestock breeding industry has developed to more than twenty types of livestock. The county has afforested mountains and cultivated various fruit trees, oak trees, mulberry trees, and other economic trees of no less than dozens of varieties; fruit trees have increased by 71% compared to last year, and now there are 445,000 trees, full of flowers and fruits. It is expected to produce more than 11.2 million jin of fresh and dried fruits such as apples, chestnuts, sweet pears, hawthorns, apricots, and peaches. From the early summer cherries to the early winter honey peaches, a large number of fresh fruits can be eaten in three seasons of the year. There are hundreds of kinds of medicinal materials that are often collected; the weaving industry has been restored and developed to more than ten varieties.

The development of diversified economic production has, first of all, powerfully supported the county's industrial and agricultural production. In the past six months, the county has purchased a large number of means of production with diversified economic income. This year, more than 1,500 rubber-wheeled carts, each worth 70 yuan, have been added; small mountain villages that have never had modern tools can now hear the rumbling of portable boilers and water pumps. In particular, due to the development of livestock, the amount of high-quality fertilizer has greatly increased. In the spring, in addition to topdressing wheat, the average application of basal manure to spring-sown crops was 5,900 jin per mu, an increase of 1.3 times compared to last year. At the same time, the development of diversified economies has also greatly enlivened the commercial economy and strongly supported national construction. In 1957, the county's total purchase amount was only 2.78 million yuan, but in 1958 it suddenly increased to 5.58 million yuan, and the purchase amount in the first half of this year is equivalent to the total purchase amount in 1957. The market supply of pigs, sheep, chickens, fish, vegetable non-staple foods has also increased compared to the past. For pigs alone, a total of 48,000 fat pigs (10,000 this year) have been sold to the state since last year. During the same period, more than 110,000 piglets, 80 head of draft cattle, more than 200,000 fruit tree seedlings, and a large number of eggs and fresh fruits were also supplied to fraternal counties.

Due to the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, the people's living standards have improved significantly. In the first half of this year, the average per capita net income in the county was more than 20 yuan in cash. By the end of June this year, the total amount of farmers' savings reached 610,000 yuan, an increase of 74% compared to the same period last year. The Jietou Commune, which was particularly poor in the past, saved a total of 110,000 yuan. The 5,100 households of the Songbai Commune saved an average of more than 10 yuan per household after the wheat harvest. Mentioning these things, the commune members all joyfully praised: "Today's Wulian County, cattle and sheep are in groups and pigs are full of pens, chickens, ducks and rabbits are lively in the manor, silkworm cocoons are like egg flowers and fruits are fragrant, reservoirs raise fish and trees cover the sky."

Wulian County's outstanding achievements are due to the great power displayed by the people's commune under the leadership of the Party. In the past, during the period of advanced cooperatives, the mountain economy had made great progress, but it had not yet developed comprehensively, systematically, and on a large scale. Since communization last year, manpower and material resources have been used rationally, and the integration of government and commune has made it possible for people to be assigned from the county party committee to the commune and production team levels, from leaders to the masses. It is possible to vigorously grasp agricultural production and develop diversified economies, so that various economies can develop in a comprehensive and balanced way. In specific actions, the county implemented the working method of layer-by-layer planning, comprehensive arrangements, and joint action by communes, teams, and households, combining leadership and the masses, and combining collectives and individuals. At the same time, it also grasped the principle of combining regular production with seasonal production, combining key points with general points, combining current production with long-term production, and combining production, supply, and sales. This has formed a mass movement in which everyone participates and every household takes action. When the county grasped agricultural production, it vigorously implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and at the same time, it also vigorously grasped the key to increasing production on various diversified economic fronts. Therefore, not only has agriculture increased significantly, but diversified economies have also greatly developed.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 14th: Currently, farmers in Heilongjiang Province are intensively carrying out the third round of hoeing and weeding, and will soon "hang up their hoes" (the end of hoeing and weeding). The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions, requiring that from the "hanging up of hoes" to the autumn harvest, this valuable period of time should be used to vigorously grasp the late-stage field management of autumn crops, while vigorously grasping diversified rural operations and preparing for next year's production, in order to promote a double harvest of agriculture and sideline occupations throughout the province, and to lay a solid foundation for next year's production.

In Heilongjiang Province, the "hanging up of hoes" period is the harvest season for various sideline products: mountain grapes, daylilies, fungus, radishes, and medicinal materials are all ripe, and various fish in the rivers have also reached the harvest season. Farmers have always had the habit and requirement of engaging in large-scale sideline production during this period. Therefore, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires all localities to take leading the people's communes in engaging in diversified operations as the primary task during the hoe-hanging period. During this period, in addition to continuing to focus on pig and poultry production and the mating and breeding of large livestock, in grassland areas, it is necessary to organize the masses to collect a large amount of "yang grass" (a highly nutritious pasture grass), collect and store livestock feed; in saline-alkali areas, it is necessary to organize farmers to engage in large-scale alkali soil extraction, and boil salt, alkali, brine, potassium, and nitrate; in mountainous areas and areas near rivers and lakes, it is necessary to widely collect mountain products such as mushrooms, fungus, medicinal materials, and raw materials for wild oil and wine, carry out fishing, hunting, and raise bees, silkworms, field chickens, and wild animals. At the same time, it is also necessary to restore and develop weaving production and rural inherent handicraft production. The Provincial Party Committee instructed all localities to combine the seasonal rush sideline production with the construction of barns, pigsties, poultry houses, fish ponds, and fungus fields when carrying out the above-mentioned production; at the same time, attention should also be paid to cultivating bases for local, sideline, and special products.

During the "hanging up of hoes" period in rural areas, it is also the period when various crops grow and develop and the grains are filling. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee called on all localities to break the theory of fixedness and implement the late-stage field management of autumn crops throughout. Various methods should be used to eliminate weeds and loosen the soil for various crops, so as to facilitate ventilation and light transmission, promote early maturity of crops, and avoid early frost. At the same time, it is also necessary to plant, harvest, and store various autumn vegetables, especially in urban suburbs, to grow vegetables well in order to meet the needs of urban and rural people's lives this winter and next spring.

The Provincial Party Committee called on all localities to seize the time to prepare for the autumn harvest and next year's production while carrying out the above two tasks.

When arranging the "hanging up of hoes" work, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized the need to properly arrange the commune members' household life, such as digging kangs (heated brick beds), plastering walls, repairing houses, and gathering firewood. For female commune members, they should be given time to dismantle and wash bedding and sew winter clothes. (Attached picture)

    农业生产为主  开展多种经营  支援国家建设  增加社员收入
    五莲县农林牧副渔全面发展
    中共黑龙江省委安排大秋作物田间管理和各种副业生产
    本报济南14日电　山东省五莲县，今年获得公社化后第一个农业大丰收的同时，以生猪、家禽、果品等为中心内容的多种经济生产，也频传捷报，收益猛增。目前这个曾经以贫瘠闻名的山区，旧地新貌，山色绮丽，到处呈现着农林牧副渔全面大发展的繁荣康乐景象。
    今年五莲县的夏收比过去任何一年都好。这个县去年小麦平均亩产一百三十五斤，今年平均亩产一百八十斤。这个县过去一向缺粮的情况，在去年已经得到了改善，不但全部自给，并卖出余粮四千四百六十万斤。今年比去年收成更好，到目前为止，一千万斤夏粮的征购任务已经完成了91％。
    多种经济的发展，今年更为显著。据1至6月份统计：全县生猪存养量达十八万头，比去年年底存养量十一万五千头跃增56％多；繁殖耕牛一千九百四十头；包括鸡鸭在内的家禽业已由去年的十六万三千四百只发展到五十七万三千九百只，增加了两倍半，全县八万户平均每户七只多；新兴的养鱼业，也已由去年的七十万尾放养到一百七十万尾。半年来，柞蚕比去年同期增长一倍，养蜂增长76％。整个畜牧饲养业已发展到二十多养。全县封山造林培育的各种果树、柞树、桑树等经济林木不下几十种；果树比去年增长71％，现在已有四十四万五千株，花满果丰，预计可产苹果、板栗、甜梨、山楂、杏、桃等鲜、干果品一千一百二十多万斤，从初夏的樱桃到初冬的蜜桃，一年三季都可吃上大量的鲜果。经常采集的药材有几百种；编织业已恢复发展到十多种。
    多种经济生产的发展，首先，有力地支援了这个县的工农业生产。半年来，全县以多种经济收入购买了大批的生产资料，仅价值七十元的胶轮小车今年就添置了一千五百多辆；历来没有现代工具的小山村，如今都已听到锅驼机、抽水机的隆隆声。特别是由于牲畜的发展，优质肥料大量增加，春季除小麦追肥外，春播作物平均亩施基圈肥五千九百斤，比去年增加一点三倍。同时，多种经济的发展，也大大活跃了商业经济，大力支援了国家建设。1957年全县收购额仅二百七十八万元，1958年就突增到五百五十八万元，而今年上半年的收购额则相等于1957年收购额的总和。猪、羊、鸡、鱼、蔬菜副食品的上市量，也比过去有所增加。仅生猪一项，自去年到现在共卖给国家肥猪四万八千头（今年一万头），同期还支援兄弟县仔猪十一万多头，耕牛八十头，果树苗子二十多万株，以及大批鸡蛋、鲜果等。
    由于农林牧副渔全面大发展，人民的生活水平显著提高。今年半年来，全县平均每人纯收入现金二十多元。到今年6月底，农民储蓄总额达六十一万元，比去年同期增加74％。过去特别贫穷的街头公社，总计储蓄十一万元。五千一百户的松柏公社在麦收后平均每户存款十元多。提到这些事，社员们无不欣快地颂扬：“今日的五莲县，牛羊成群猪满圈，鸡鸭兔闹庄园，蚕茧赛蛋花果香，库库养鱼树遮天。”
    五莲县取得这样的优异成绩，是由于人民公社在党的领导下显示了巨大的威力。过去在高级社时期，山区经济虽然有了很大的发展，但还没有全面地、系统地、大量地发展。从去年公社化以后，人力物力合理使用，政社合一，从县委直至公社、生产队，从领导到群众，都有可能分出人马，既能大力抓农业生产，又能开发多种经济，使各项经济综合平衡发展。在具体行动中，这个县贯彻了层层计划、全面安排、社队户一齐行动的工作方法，使领导和群众相结合，集体和个人相结合。同时又掌握经常性生产与季节性生产相结合，重点与一般相结合，当前生产与长远生产相结合，产、供、销相结合等两条腿走路的方针。这样就形成了一个人人动手、户户行动的群众运动。这个县在抓农业生产时，是大力贯彻农业
  “八字宪法”，同时在多种经济战线上，也大抓增产关键。因而不但农业显著增产，多种经济也大为发展。
    本报哈尔滨14日电　目前黑龙江省农民，正在紧张进行第三遍的中耕除草，很快就要“挂锄”（中耕除草结束），中共黑龙江省委发出指示，要求从“挂锄”到秋收这一段宝贵时间，在大抓大秋作物的后期田间管理的同时，大抓农村多种经营和为明年的生产作好准备工作，以促使全省农副业双丰收，和为明年生产打下坚实的基础。
    黑龙江省在“挂锄”期间，正是各种副业产品的收获季节：满山遍野的山葡萄、黄花菜、木耳、萝卜和药材等均已成熟，江河的各种鱼类也到了捕获的季节。农民历来在这期间就有大搞副业生产的习惯和要求。因此，中共黑龙江省委要求各地把领导人民公社大搞多种经营，作为挂锄期间的首要任务。在这期间除继续抓紧猪、禽生产和大牲畜的配种和繁殖工作外，在草原地区，要组织群众大量打洋草（一种营养价值很高的牧草），搜集和储备牲畜饲料；盐碱地区要组织农民大搞土碱，熬制盐、碱、卤、钾、硝等；山区和靠近江湖地区，要广泛采集山货，如蘑菇、木耳、药材和野生油酒原料，开展捕鱼，狩猎，以及饲养蜂、蚕、田鸡和野生动物，与此同时还要恢复和发展编织品生产和农村固有的手工业生产。省委指示各地在进行上述生产的时候，应把季节性突击的副业生产，和修好马棚、猪圈、禽舍、鱼塘、木耳场等常年建设结合起来；同时还要注意培植土、副、特产品的基地。
    在农村“挂锄”期间，也正是各种作物成长发育和灌浆结籽的时期，因此，省委号召各地打破定局论，把大秋作物的后期田间管理贯彻始终。各种作物都要用各种方法消灭杂草，疏松土壤，以利通风、透光，促进作物成长早熟，避免早霜。同时，还要多种多收多储各类秋菜，特别是城镇郊区要种好蔬菜，以满足今冬明春城乡人民生活的需要。
    省委号召各地在进行上述两项工作的时候，还要抓紧时间作好秋收和明年生产准备工作。
    中共黑龙江省委在安排“挂锄”工作的时候，强调指出要妥善安排社员的家务生活，比如挖炕、抹墙、修盖房屋、打柴等等，对于女社员，要给她们拆洗被褥，缝制冬衣的时间。（附图片）
