Xinhua News Agency, July 29th. The sections of the Beijing-Shenyang (Beijing to Shenyang) Railway that were damaged by floods have been repaired. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of railway departments and local Party, government, military, and civilians, the single track was restored on the 26th, the double track was restored on the 28th, and passenger and freight trains resumed operations on the 29th. A reporter learned from the Ministry of Railways that in the initial days after the reopening of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, the priority will be to transport the passengers who have been stranded at various stations along the route for the past week. Following that, accumulated cargo in transit will be transported. Subsequently, passenger and freight transport services will officially resume.

Because the roadbed of the newly repaired line is relatively soft and the bridges need to be reinforced, the train speed will be slower, and the number of trains running will be somewhat limited. It is expected that the number of passenger trains between Beijing and Shenyang will be reduced by about half compared to normal in the coming days. The railway department is organizing forces to reinforce the lines and bridges, increase the train speed, and restore normal transportation order between Beijing and Shenyang as soon as possible. At the same time, it hopes that passengers along the line will consider the overall interests and postpone travel if possible to avoid crowding.

During the interruption of traffic on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, the Ministry of Communications immediately increased the number of ships on the Tianjin-Dalian route, changing the liner service from once every four days to once every other day. The Civil Aviation Administration also temporarily added passenger flights between Beijing and Shenyang. The railway department made arrangements for the food and lodging of passengers stranded in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Jinzhou, and other places.

    京沈铁路恢复通车
    据新华社29日讯　京沈（北京至沈阳）铁路部分被洪水冲坏的地段，经过铁路部门和当地党、政、军、民协同抢修，已经在26日修复了单线，28日修复了双线，29日起通行客货列车。记者从铁道部获悉，京沈铁路恢复通车后的最初几天，将首先抢运一周来被阻在途中各站的旅客，继而抢运积压在中途的货物，接着就正式办理客货运输。
    新修复的线路，因为路基较松软，桥梁也须加固，行车速度较慢，行驶列车的对数将受到一定的限制。预计未来几天内，北京、沈阳间的旅客列车，要比正常情况下减少一半左右。铁道部门一方面正组织力量加固线路桥梁，提高行车速度，尽快地恢复北京、沈阳间的正常运输秩序，同时希望沿线旅客从全局利益考虑，凡可以推迟旅行的尽量推迟，避免拥挤。
    在京沈铁路交通中断期间，交通部立即在天津到大连的航线间增加了船只，把原来四天一次的班轮，改为隔日开一次；民用航空局也在北京、沈阳间临时增加了载客班机。铁道部门设法安排了被阻在北京、天津、沈阳、锦州等地的旅客的食宿等问题。
