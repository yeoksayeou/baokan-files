Strive for Actual Output to Exceed Contracted Output
    Zhang Ke
    In his article "Pay Attention to Economic Work," Chairman Mao said, "We must carry out all economic mobilization work according to the specific environment, the specific emotions displayed by the masses..." The practice of Xinle County, Hebei Province, in launching a competition for exceeding the production quota by 10% or 20% throughout the county, based on the implementation of contracted production targets, was proposed in accordance with the current rural situation and the emotions and demands of the masses. This timely mobilization slogan and clear goal will certainly play a significant role in the struggle to strive for over-production and win a bumper autumn harvest.
    Carrying out the over-production movement is based on the demands of the masses. After the people's communes were rectified and consolidated, the Party's various policies regarding the people's communes have taken root in the hearts of the people. Therefore, increasing grain production at a faster rate has become the urgent demand of the broad masses. The Xinle County Party Committee seized this demand and timely proposed the call to exceed the contracted output in actual production, closely combining the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, which will better mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and strive to complete the over-production task.
    The slogan for the over-production movement is loud and clear, and the goals are clear, so that the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses can be brought into full play. In a battle, the soldiers must understand the enemy's situation and the tasks and objectives of this campaign and battle; the same is true for agricultural production, the broad masses of commune members should also understand the situation and have clear goals. The Xinle County Party Committee proposed a call to increase production by 10% or 20% on the basis of the implementation of contracted production targets. The task is very specific and the goal is very clear. With this clear goal, the masses can easily take measures, increase their efforts, and strive for over-production.
    Actual production exceeding contracted output is not only a very good mobilization slogan, but also an achievable goal. The contracted output is a general requirement proposed under normal conditions, and there is room for flexibility. With more measures and more effort, the contracted production target can be exceeded; if the measures are not followed up and the effort is relaxed, it may not be completed. The possibility of actual production exceeding contracted output exists, and whether it can be achieved depends on the degree of human effort. Facts have also proved this point. In the field management of autumn harvest crops, many areas have focused on improving the third-class seedlings, and in places where it is done well, the third-class seedlings have generally been upgraded. The key to the quality of seedlings is the growing conditions. As long as people work hard to change the growing conditions, third-class seedlings can be upgraded to second-class seedlings, second-class seedlings can be upgraded to first-class seedlings, and the standards of first-class seedlings can also be continuously improved to make the seedlings grow better. If we calculate that each grade increase in seedlings can increase production by 15%, then the upgrading of seedlings alone can enable us to increase production by several tens of percent.
    Of course, the conditions and methods for striving for over-production are far more than these, and new experiences and methods will continue to emerge with the development of work. As long as we can fully mobilize the masses and fully utilize these favorable factors like the Xinle County Party Committee, the actual output will definitely be able to exceed the contracted production target.

    争取实产超包产
    张克
    毛主席在“必须注意经济工作”一文中，谈到动员群众方式的时候说：“我们要按照具体的环境、具体地表现出来的群众情绪……去做一切经济动员的工作。”河北新乐县在包产指标落实的基础上，在全县范围内开展超产一成、二成的竞赛运动的做法，就是按照当前农村形势，根据群众情绪和群众要求提出来的。这个适时的动员口号和明确的奋斗目标，在争取超额增产，夺取秋季大丰收的斗争中，一定能发生很大的作用。
    开展超产运动，是根据群众的要求提出来的。人民公社经过整顿和巩固以后，党的关于人民公社的各项政策已经深入人心。因此，用更快的速度增产粮食，已经成为广大群众的迫切要求。新乐县委抓住了这个要求，及时提出实产超包产的号召，把国家、集体和个人的利益密切结合起来，这就能更好地调动群众积极性，努力完成超产任务。
    开展超产运动的口号响亮，目标明确，这样才能高度地发挥群众的积极性、创造性。打仗，要使战士了解敌情，了解这次战役、战斗的任务和目的；搞农业生产也是这样，也应该使广大社员了解情况，目标明确。新乐县委提出的在包产指标落实的基础上，再增产一、二成号召，任务很具体，目标很明确。群众有了这个明确的目标，就便于采取措施，增加干劲，力争超产。
    实产超包产不仅是一个很好的动员口号，也是一个能够实现的目标。包产是根据正常条件提出的一般要求，本身就存在着伸缩的余地。多加一些措施，多鼓一把劲，包产指标就可以超过；措施跟不上，松一下劲，也可能完不成。实产超包产的可能性是存在的，能不能实现就要看人的努力程度了。事实也证明了这一点，在秋收作物的田间管理中，很多地区抓紧提高三类苗这个环节，而且做得好的地方，三类苗普遍提升了级。禾苗好坏的关键是生长条件，只要人们努力改变生长条件，三类苗可以升二类苗，二类苗可以升一类苗，而一类苗的标准也可以不断提高，使禾苗生长的更好。如果以禾苗每升一级便可增产15％计算，单是禾苗升级一项就能使我们增产几成。
    当然，争取超产的条件和办法，远不止此，而且随着工作的发展，新的经验和办法还会不断地涌现，只要我们能够像新乐县委那样充分发动群众，充分运用这些有利因素，实际产量超过包产指标是一定能够达到的。
