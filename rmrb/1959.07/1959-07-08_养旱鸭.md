    Raising Land Ducks
    Yà Yún
    Ducks love water. They spend all day swimming in ponds or lakes, relying on catching fish, shrimp, and searching for snails and clams for food. They also eat grain, but it's not their main source of sustenance. So, those who raise ducks usually just let them roam freely.
    In reality, ducks can also be raised on land. Those raised in rivers are called water ducks, and those raised on land are called land ducks. Some places in Jiangsu have a custom of raising land ducks.
    Once land ducks are accustomed to living on land, they won't go into the water even when they are near a river. If you throw them into the water, they will struggle to get back to shore and won't stay in the water for even a minute.
    Raising land ducks mainly involves controlling them from the chick stage, not letting them go into the water. After raising them for ten days or so, make a few small cuts on their webs with scissors to reduce their swimming ability, making them panic when they enter the water. If you don't cut their webs, in addition to restricting them from going into the water when they are young, you can tie a thin string with a small piece of wood to their feet when they grow up. When they enter the water, because there's something tied to their legs, they will paddle frantically, and the wood will go up and down. The duck will be so frightened that it will quickly climb ashore. After being scared several times, it will no longer dare to go into the water.
    Compared to raising water ducks, raising land ducks can reduce a lot of trouble. Land ducks become good friends with chickens and live with them all day, leaving in the morning and returning in the evening, never separating. Land ducks lay eggs for a longer period than water ducks, generally laying one hundred to one hundred and twenty eggs a year, while water ducks only lay sixty to eighty eggs. Moreover, land duck eggs are darker in color and taste better than water duck eggs, but land duck eggs are not as large as water duck eggs.

    养旱鸭
    亚云
    鸭喜欢水，终日在池塘或湖里游来游去，专靠捕捉鱼、虾和寻找螺蚌生活，它们也吃粮食，但不是主要的，所以养群鸭的，纯粹靠放。
    其实，旱地同样能养鸭，在河里养的叫水鸭，在岸上养的叫旱鸭。江苏一些地方就有养旱鸭的习惯。
    当旱鸭习惯了在陆地上生活之后，就是临到河边，也不肯到水里去，万一将它抛进水中，它也挣着上岸，不愿意在水里呆上一分钟。
    养旱鸭，主要是从雏出期进行控制，不把它放到水里去，养上十多天再在蹼上用剪刀剪几个小口，减少它的泅水能力，使它一下水就慌张起来。如果不剪蹼的话，除限制它在幼时不下水外，长大时在它的脚上系根细绳子，拴上一个小木块，当它一下水，因腿上有个东西系着，于是就拼命的划，木块也跟着一上一下，鸭子便吓得连忙爬上岸，连吓几次，也就不敢再下水了。
    养旱鸭和养水鸭比较起来，可以减少很多麻烦。旱鸭和鸡交了很好的朋友，终日跟鸡生活在一起，朝出晚归，绝不分离。旱鸭的生蛋期比水鸭长，一般一年要生到一百至一百二十个，水鸭只生六十至八十个，而且旱鸭蛋比水鸭的颜色老，味又佳，但是旱鸭蛋没有水鸭的蛋大。
