Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 28th: A certain unit of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, at the Wumeng Mountain tunnel complex construction site of the Nei (jiang) Kun (ming) Railway, successfully adopted the Soviet Union's advanced experience of "full-face" tunnel excavation for the first time, increasing engineering efficiency by about one-fold.

The Wumeng Mountain tunnel complex, with seventy-one tunnels on an eighty-kilometer line and a total length of thirty-seven kilometers, is the most arduous and complex section of the entire Fujian-Yunnan Railway construction project. The Party Committee of a certain unit of the Railway Corps, based on the characteristics of this section of the project with its numerous and long tunnels, and the existing mechanical equipment conditions of the troops, actively mobilized the broad masses of officers, soldiers, and technical personnel to carry out technical innovations and learn advanced experience. After nearly half a year of practice, it has been proven that the Soviet Union's "full-face" tunnel excavation method is the most effective method for rapid construction of tunnels with rock hardness of (5) or above. Its advantages are: fewer work procedures, a wider work surface, allowing for fuller use of large machinery for comprehensive mechanical excavation; at the same time, it also facilitates smoke exhaust and the installation of electromechanical pipelines, allowing air to circulate inside the tunnel. The unconfined surface of the blasting point is large, which also saves blasting materials.

The construction troops undertaking this section of the project, after multiple experiments, have now adopted the "full-face" excavation method at sixteen tunnel portals. The daily progress has generally reached about two meters, and all support timber has been saved. The consumption of blasting materials has also been reduced by 26% to 68% compared to the state quota.

    乌蒙山上开隧道苏联经验奏奇功
    新华社昆明28日电　中国人民解放军铁道兵某部，在内（江）昆（明）铁路乌蒙山隧道群工地，首次采用苏联“全断面”开挖隧道的先进经验获得成功，使工程效率增加一倍左右。
    在八十多公里线路上有七十一座隧道的乌蒙山隧道群，工程总长三十七公里，是闽滇铁路全线修建工程中最艰巨最复杂的一段。铁道兵某部党委根据这段工程隧道多、隧道长的特点，以及部队现有机械设备条件，积极发动广大官兵和技术人员开展技术革新，学习先进经验。经过近半年来的实践证明，苏联创造的“全断面”开挖隧道的先进经验，是开挖石质硬度在（五）以上的隧道快速施工最有效的方法，它的好处是：工序少、作业面宽，可以更充分地使用大型机械，作到全面机械开挖；同时，也便于排烟和装设机电管路，洞内空气流通，爆破点的临空面大，也节约爆破器材。
    担任这段工程任务的施工部队，经过多次试验以后，目前已先后在十六个隧道洞口采用了“全断面”开挖方法，日进度普遍达到两米左右，并节约了全部支撑木材；爆破器材的消耗量也比国家定额减少26％到68％。
