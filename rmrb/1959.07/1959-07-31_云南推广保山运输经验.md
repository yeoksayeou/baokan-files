Yunnan Promotes Baoshan Transportation Experience
The county's Commercial Bureau overfulfilled the second quarter's main agricultural and sideline product transportation plan after signing a transportation contract with the commune.
Kunming Dispatch, July 30th: Under the leadership of the Baoshan County Party Committee, the Baoshan County Commercial Bureau closely cooperated with all parties to vigorously organize short-distance transportation, accelerating the circulation of goods between urban and rural areas. In the second quarter, the transportation plans for major agricultural and sideline products, such as cotton and cured meat, were overfulfilled; more than one hundred and ninety-six tons of materials, such as brown sugar and medicinal materials, which had been stockpiled for more than two years, were all transported. At the same time, large quantities of agricultural tools, pesticides, salt, cloth, and general merchandise were shipped in from other places.
At the end of the first quarter of this year, the Baoshan County Party Committee focused on short-distance transportation work, instructing the Party committees of each commune to organize forces to participate in short-distance transportation. The Commercial Bureau quickly established a material dispatch office, and in cooperation with relevant units such as the finance department, transferred fifty-eight people to assist in mobilizing the masses in various communes and to help solve specific problems. In just over ten days, the communes and muleteers dispatched three thousand nine hundred and seventy mules, horses, and cattle, more than tripling the original transportation capacity, forming a massive short-distance transportation team. The County Commercial Bureau also signed sixty-six transportation contracts with communes and muleteers, implementing planned transportation. Practice has proven that the implementation of contract transportation has three major benefits: First, it facilitates national dispatch and the planned arrangement of transportation tasks. Second, after the communes know the transportation tasks, time, and income, it is easier to rationally arrange labor. Third, the muleteers clarified the tasks, time, and requirements, enabling them to make long-term plans and work well. In this way, it is possible to give play to the enthusiasm of the communes and the broad masses and ensure the completion of the national transportation plan.
In order to ensure strong manpower and livestock and safe transportation, the Baoshan County Commercial Bureau made careful arrangements for the food and lodging of people and livestock. Therefore, the transportation personnel were all in a happy mood and full of energy.
The Yunnan Provincial Department of Commerce recently held an on-site meeting in Baoshan to organize short-distance transportation, deciding to promote the experience of the Baoshan Commercial Bureau in the commercial departments throughout the province. (Shen Qingquan)

    云南推广保山运输经验
    这个县的商业局同公社订运输合同以后，第二季度主要农副产品运输计划超额完成
    本报昆明30日电　云南省保山县商业局在县委领导下，与各方面紧密协作，大力组织短途运输，加速城乡商品流转。第二季度，主要农副产品，如棉花、腌肉等，都超额完成了调运计划；积压了两年多的红糖、药材等一百九十六吨物资全部调运完毕。同时，从外地运进大批农具、农药、食盐、布匹、百货等物品。
    今年一季度末，中共保山县委抓紧了短途运输工作，指示各公社党委组织力量参加短途运输。商业局迅速成立了物资调运办公室，并配合财政部门等有关单位，抽调五十八人，分别到各公社去协助发动群众，帮助解决具体问题。十多天时间，公社和马帮就抽调出骡、马、牛三千九百七十匹，比原来运力增加了三倍多，组成了一支声势浩大的短途运输队伍。县商业局又和公社、马帮签订了六十六份运输合同，实行计划调运。实践证明，实行合同运输有三大好处：一、便于国家调度，有计划地安排运输任务。二、公社知道运输任务、时间、收入以后，便于合理安排劳动力。三、马帮明确了任务、时间和要求，能作长期打算，很好地工作。这样，便能发挥公社和广大群众的积极性，保证完成国家的调运计划。
    为了做到人强马壮，安全运输，保山县商业局对人、马的食宿作了认真的安排。因此，运输人员一个个心情愉快，干劲十足。
    云南省商业厅最近在保山召开了组织短途运输的现场会议，决定在全省商业部门中推广保山商业局的经验。　（沈清泉）
