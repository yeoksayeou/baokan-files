Anhui, July 5th (from our newspaper) – Anhui Province recently adopted several important measures in organizational management to ensure the quality of pig iron. These measures were decided at the Provincial Iron Smelting Work Conference. The basic points of the measures are: First, all iron smelting plants in the province will produce according to designated product plans in the second half of the year; second, mines, coking plants, and refractory material plants will, in principle, be placed under the leadership of steel plants, or a fixed-point supply method will be adopted; third, the policy of premium quality and premium prices will be implemented for ore, coke, refractory materials, and pig iron.

From the experience exchanged at the conference, to achieve high-quality, high-yield, low-consumption, and low-cost operation of blast furnaces, it is necessary to vigorously improve operating techniques, reduce raw material particle size, classify materials before charging into the furnace, roast ore, sinter ore powder, use quicklime in the furnace, appropriately control slag alkalinity, use multi-nozzle combustion, strengthen the maintenance and management of hot blast stoves, and use double hot blast stoves and double fans in parallel.

To ensure that pig iron quality meets national standards, the conference decided that all iron smelting plants in the province will produce according to designated product plans in the second half of the year. This plan is: the 71 to 255 cubic meter blast furnaces of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant will mainly produce pig iron needed for alkaline converter steelmaking; small blast furnaces of 8 to 28 cubic meters in various parts of the province will supply some for steelmaking and some for producing foundry iron. The conference estimated that adopting this measure would make the pig iron produced in the province more in line with the needs of users for various specifications and varieties, changing the passive situation of using whatever iron was produced in the past. When the iron and steel industry was first established at the beginning of last year, iron smelting plants in Anhui Province could not control the quality of pig iron due to immature technology and other conditions. In the first half of this year, due to the continuous improvement of technology and management levels, and the addition of testing equipment, some units have been able to smelt pig iron that fully meets the requirements of steelmaking; these facts prove that small blast furnaces can produce according to designated specifications and quality.

To ensure high quality and high yield of small blast furnaces, the conference also carefully studied strengthening raw material production and transportation work. The conference determined that mines, coking plants, and refractory material plants should, in principle, be placed under the leadership of steel plants. A small number of those that are not convenient to be placed under the leadership of steel plants should also establish fixed-point supply relationships with steel plants.

To encourage the improvement of pig iron quality, the conference decided to implement the method of premium quality and premium prices for ore, coke, refractory materials, and pig iron. Currently, it is mainly based on the sulfur content to determine four grades, with the price of the second grade as the standard price. The first grade iron is 20 yuan more per ton than the second grade iron, the third grade iron is 20 yuan less per ton than the second grade iron, and the fourth grade iron is 50 yuan less per ton than the second grade iron. The cost of iron is reduced, and the difference in price between the various grades of iron remains unchanged. The price of iron ore with an iron content of 45% is the standard price, and for every 1% increase or decrease in ore grade, the price increases or decreases by 0.5 yuan per ton. There are specific regulations for other coal and refractory materials. The premium quality and premium price method is a positive approach to improving quality. It was decided that factories with the necessary conditions should implement this method on July 1, and other factories should prepare and implement it fully in August.

The conference believes that to improve pig iron quality, it is also necessary to strengthen the enterprise's production and technical management system. The conference required all factories and mines to quickly establish and improve technical supervision, testing and analysis organizations and systems, and implement systems for grading, stacking, and transporting materials according to variety.

The conference studied the adjustment of the layout of blast furnaces based on the principles of being close to raw materials, transportation, water and electricity, and convenient management. On the premise that the original layout of blast furnaces is basically reasonable, it was decided to strengthen large factories and merge small factories to prepare for the further development of the iron smelting industry.

The conference emphasized that as long as effective measures are taken organizationally, technically, and managerially, it is entirely possible to ensure the rapid improvement of pig iron quality. The delegates attending the meeting were full of confidence in improving the quality of steel and iron and overfulfilling the state production plan in the second half of the year. They expressed that they must strive to push the quality and output of iron in the province to a new level in the shortest possible time.

### 加强组织管理贯彻优质优价  安徽从三个方面进一步提高生铁质量

    加强组织管理贯彻优质优价
    安徽从三个方面进一步提高生铁质量
    一、全省各炼铁厂一律按指定产品计划进行生产
    二、矿山炼焦耐火材料厂原则上划归钢铁厂领导
    三、矿石焦炭耐火材料生铁贯彻优质优价的政策
    本报安徽5日电　安徽省最近从组织管理上采取几项重要措施，确保生铁质量。这些措施是全省炼铁工作会议决定的。措施的基本要点是：一、全省各个炼铁厂下半年一律按指定产品计划生产；二、矿山、炼焦厂、耐火材料厂原则上划归钢铁厂领导，或是采用定点供应的办法；三、实行矿石、焦炭、耐火材料、生铁的优质优价办法。
    从会上交流的经验来看，要使高炉优质高产、消耗低成本低，必须大力改进操作技术、缩小原料粒度，分级入炉，焙烧矿石，烧结矿粉，用生石灰入炉，适当控制炉渣碱度，采用多嘴燃烧，加强热风炉的维修和管理，双热风炉双风机并联使用等等。
    为了使生铁质量达到国家规定的标准，会议决定各个炼铁厂下半年一律按指定产品计划生产。这个计划是：马鞍山钢铁厂七十一至二百五十五立方米的高炉主要生产碱性转炉炼钢所需的生铁；全省各地八至二十八立方米的小高炉一部分供应炼钢需要，一部分生产铸造铁。会议估计，采取这一措施以后，将使全省所产的生铁更加符合使用单位对各种规格品种的需要，改变过去生产什么铁用什么铁的被动情况。去年初办钢铁工业的时候，安徽省各炼铁厂由于技术等条件不成熟，对生铁的质量还不能控制。今年上半年，由于技术和管理水平的不断提高，又增加了化验设备，有些单位已能冶炼完全符合炼钢要求的生铁；这些事实证明：小高炉可以按指定的规格质量进行生产。
    为了确保小高炉优质高产，会议还细致地研究了加强原材料生产和调运工作。会议确定矿山、焦厂、耐火材料厂原则上都划归钢铁厂领导，少数不便划给钢铁厂领导的，也要和钢铁厂建立定点供应关系。
    为了鼓励提高生铁质量，会议决定实行矿石、焦炭、耐火材料、生铁的优质优价办法。目前主要以含硫成分多少定成四个等级，以二级的价格为标准价，一级铁每吨比二级铁多二十元，三级铁每吨比二级铁少二十元，四级铁每吨比二级铁少五十元，铁的成本降低，各级铁铁差数不变。铁矿石以含铁量45％的价格为标准价，矿石品位每增减1％，价格每吨增减零点五元。其他煤炭、耐火材料都有具体规定。优质优价办法是提高质量的积极作法。这个办法确定有条件的厂在7月1日实行，其他厂作好准备工作，8月全部实行。
    会议认为，要提高生铁质量，还必须加强企业的生产、技术管理制度。会议要求各厂矿迅速建立和健全技术监督、化验分析的组织和制度，按品种分级堆放和输送制度等。
    会议根据就原料、就交通、就水电和便于管理等原则研究了调整高炉的布局问题。在原高炉布局基本合理的情况下，决定加强大厂、合并小厂，为进一步发展炼铁工业做好准备。
    会议强调指出，只要从组织上、技术上、管理上采取有效措施，保证生铁质量迅速提高，是完全有可能的。到会代表对下半年提高钢铁质量，超额完成国家生产计划充满了信心，他们表示一定要争取在最短的时间内把全省铁的质量和产量推向一个新的水平。
