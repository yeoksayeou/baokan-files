    Guizhou, Ningxia Cadres Study Political Economics

    (Our Newspaper News) In Guizhou Province, cadres directly under the provincial government and cadres of the Guiyang city-level organs have universally begun to study political economics. Units that started earlier have already studied Chapters 24 to 26. The broad masses of cadres have a high enthusiasm for learning, and some units have initially achieved good results.

    After the arrangement for the study of political economics was made, the party organizations of all units attached great importance to it and carried out relatively detailed ideological and organizational work. Through these efforts, some cadres' fear of difficulties, such as thinking that theory is difficult to learn, were dispelled. In the study, various counseling activities were carried out through study committees, central groups, etc., to help cadres understand the essence of each chapter, so as to prepare for small group discussions and large group discussions, so that the broad masses of cadres actively participated in the study. In addition to studying diligently during the stipulated time, many cadres also took time out of their spare time to read reference documents. Cadres of the Personnel Department of the Municipal People's Committee have been ensuring study time and reading carefully since the beginning of the study, and those who go out for business also squeeze time to persist in the study.

    On the basis of seriously studying books, the cadres who participated in the study paid great attention to discussing and studying in connection with the situation of socialist construction in our country and the party's policies. When studying Chapters 25 and 26, the cadres of the Editorial and Review Department of the Provincial Publishing Bureau, combined the specific application of socialist economic laws in our country, especially in connection with our country's complete set of "walking on two legs" policy and the new problems that have emerged in the current economic life, conducted in-depth study and discussion, so that many comrades more clearly recognized the superiority of socialism and the objective nature of economic laws.

    At present, the Party Committee of the Guizhou Provincial Direct Organs and the Propaganda and Education Department of the Guiyang Municipal Committee are seizing the units with better integration of theory and practice and flexible learning methods to help them summarize experience and prepare for promotion. At the same time, they have also begun to pay attention to and correct the deviations of rigidly adhering to the provisions or getting entangled in some nouns and terms in the study, and improve the learning methods that ignore understanding the basic principles and spirit of the entire text.
                      (Wu Chengzhi)

    (Our Newspaper News) Cadres at all levels in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region who participated in theoretical study have successively switched to systematically studying the "Textbook of Political Economics" (Socialist Part) since May.

    In this study, leading cadres at all levels took the lead in learning and adhering to the study system, taking good leadership of the study as part of the leadership work, which greatly promoted the theoretical study of middle and primary level cadres. Now, every "study day," the cadres participating in theoretical study are reading carefully and closely linking with their own thoughts and work reality to conduct special discussions, striving to deeply understand the principles and solve problems in their work.

    Rural grass-roots cadres also study some basic theoretical knowledge while studying the current policies of the Party in rural areas.

    In order to carry out the theoretical study of cadres in a planned and led manner, the autonomous region and the party committees of various counties and cities have made specific arrangements, established a theoretical study system, equipped full-time theoretical teachers, regularly lectured to middle and primary level study groups, and also planned to invite responsible comrades from relevant departments to cooperate with theoretical study and make special reports. Some units, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient teacher strength, selected comrades with a certain theoretical foundation to attend classes at the local party school while providing guidance. Some county and city party committees have also established a core group for theoretical study to strengthen guidance on the theoretical study of cadres. The theoretical journal "Spark" of the Autonomous Region Party Committee has specially opened a learning counseling column to publish learning points, glossary, question and answer, and some articles guiding theoretical study in a timely manner.

    本报讯　贵州省直属机关和贵阳市级机关在职干部，普遍开始学习政治经济学。开始较早的单位，已经学习了第二十四到二十六等三章。广大干部学习情绪很高，有的单位已初步取得良好效果。
    布置政治经济学的学习以后，各单位党组织都很重视，进行了较细致的思想工作和组织工作。通过这些工作，解除了一些干部认为理论难学等畏难情绪。在学习中，又通过学委会、中心组等开展了各种辅导活动，帮助干部领会每章的精神实质，作到有准备的进行小组酝酿、大组讨论，使广大干部积极地参加了学习。很多干部除在规定时间认真读书外，还抽出业余时间阅读参考文件。市人民委员会人事处的干部，开始学习以来，一直保证学习时间认真读书，有事外出的也挤出时间坚持学习。
    参加学习的干部，在认真读书的基础上，很注意联系我国社会主义建设的情况和党的方针政策进行讨论和研究。省出版局编审处的干部，学第二十五和二十六章时，联系社会主义经济规律在我国的具体应用，特别是结合我国一整套“两条腿走路”的方针与当前经济生活中出现的新问题，进行了钻研、讨论，使很多同志更清楚地认识了社会主义的优越性和经济规律的客观性质。
    目前，中共贵州省直属机关党委和贵阳市委宣教部门，正抓紧理论联系实际较好、学习方法灵活多样的单位，帮助他们总结经验，准备推广。同时也开始注意和纠正学习中死扣条文或纠缠在一些名词术语上的偏向，改进忽略领会整个课文的基本原理和精神的学习方法。

    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区参加理论学习的各级干部，从5月份开始，已先后转入系统地学习“政治经济学教科书”（社会主义部分）。
    在这一学习中，各级领导干部都以身作则，带头学习，坚持学习制度，把领导好学习作为领导工作的一部分，大大推动了中、初级组干部的理论学习。现在每逢“学习日”，参加理论学习的干部，都是认真读书，并密切联系思想和工作实际，进行专题讨论，力求深刻地理解原理，并解决工作中的问题。
    农村基层干部，在学习当前党在农村的各项方针政策的同时，也学习一些基本理论常识。
    为了使干部的理论学习有计划有领导地进行，自治区和各县、市党委，都作了具体安排，建立了理论学习制度，配备了专职理论教员，定期给中、初级学习组讲课，还计划请有关部门的负责同志配合理论学习，作一些专题报告。有些单位为了解决教师力量不足的困难，选派了有一定理论基础的同志，到当地党校边听课、边进行辅导。有些县、市委还成立了理论学习核心组，加强对干部理论学习的指导。自治区党委理论刊物“星火”杂志专门辟了学习辅导栏，及时刊载学习要点、名词解释、问题解答和一些指导理论学习的文章。
