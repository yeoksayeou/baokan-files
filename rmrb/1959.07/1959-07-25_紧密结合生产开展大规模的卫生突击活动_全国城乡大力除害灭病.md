Xinhua News Agency, July 24th: From cities to villages across the country, a large-scale summer and autumn campaign to eliminate pests and diseases and promote hygiene is underway. Cities focus on eliminating mosquitoes and flies, preventing summer and autumn infectious diseases, vigorously accumulating fertilizer to support rural areas, and improving environmental sanitation. Rural areas combine production with fertilizer accumulation, manage manure properly, improve hygiene in public canteens, and prevent and control parasitic diseases. In schistosomiasis-prone areas, the focus is on eliminating schistosomiasis, driving the prevention and control of other parasitic diseases.

Recently, Beijing, Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hunan and other provinces and cities have successively held business meetings on pest and disease control, strengthened and improved the pest and disease control teams. Some provinces and cities have decided to launch several more waves of sanitation work in conjunction with production from now until the autumn harvest. Shanghai's urban areas, under the leadership of Party secretaries at all levels, have launched multiple large-scale blitzes since the beginning of July, gradually and deeply eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds, eradicating mosquitoes and flies, and accumulating and sending large quantities of fertilizer to the suburbs. Chengdu, Sichuan Province, comprehensively investigated mosquito and fly breeding grounds and deployed mosquito and fly extermination work.

Rural areas and suburbs of these provinces and cities are also paying close attention to summer sanitation work. In Guiyang County, Hunan Province, more than 350 medical personnel, together with more than 2,800 grassroots health workers in the county, formed 176 field medical stations and 365 mobile medical teams to carry out summer sanitation and epidemic prevention campaigns in rural areas, and assisted 4,124 public canteens in organizing tea delivery teams to ensure the timely supply of boiled water in the fields. In Leiyang County, Chenzhou Prefecture, there are cool sheds, sun hats, boiled water buckets, and heatstroke prevention medicines in the fields, and agricultural labor protection work is well done. Many canteens in Lianyuan County have implemented methods such as covering food with gauze, disinfecting tableware, and using cellars to refrigerate food, which has greatly reduced summer infectious diseases.

Areas with schistosomiasis are continuing to eliminate snails, strengthen manure management, and actively prevent and control the disease. Anhui Province is preparing to conduct one or two stool examinations on the entire population that should be checked in July and August, and to strengthen patient treatment. Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, recently comprehensively rectified the manure management system to ensure that fresh manure does not go to the fields, and all schistosomiasis patients in the county will be basically cured soon.

In the first half of this year, the national pest and disease control work achieved new results on the basis of the great leap forward last year. The biggest feature of the patriotic health campaign for pest and disease control in various provinces and cities is its close integration with production. Many areas combined spring plowing, water conservancy construction, and pest and disease control work, ensuring that both production and sanitation are not neglected. Jiangxi Province, in conjunction with field management and the repair of drainage and irrigation canals, carried out a small-area blitz to eliminate snails in rice paddies and ditches where snail elimination was not thorough. When transplanting rice seedlings, every three to five days, tea seed cake fertilizer was spread in the fields once or twice, which both fertilized and eliminated snails. Shanghai's urban areas, on the basis of the patriotic health campaign to promote hygiene and eliminate seven pests, launched multiple blitzes of "vigorously accumulating fertilizer, supporting rural areas, and improving environmental sanitation." According to statistics, more than 2.43 million tons of fertilizer were accumulated during the campaigns. Shanghai's suburbs are closely combining production and fertilizer accumulation to carry out pest and disease control and snail elimination activities.

Because pest and disease control work has been relatively thorough and meticulous this year, the acute infection and incidence rates of some epidemic diseases are lower than in previous years. This year, the water level of lakes in various places has risen rapidly, and the time for salvaging lake grass has also been earlier, and the number of people participating has also been large; however, due to the strengthening of personal protection and the early construction of bridges and roads, the people salvaging lake grass have reduced the opportunity to contact with epidemic water, achieving safe production. This year, 130,000 people in 71 communes in 12 counties in Hunan Province salvaged lake grass, and basically no collective infection accidents occurred. The anti-relapse work of malaria in various places has also been closely grasped, and at the same time, drugs have been used cautiously for prevention and treatment, which has greatly reduced the malaria relapse rate. According to statistics from Hunan and Guizhou provinces, the number of malaria cases has been decreasing year by year in the past year and several years, and the number of cases in the first five months of this year has decreased by more than 80% compared with the same period last year; the malaria situation in Pan County, Guizhou Province, was quite serious in previous years, and only seven people fell ill from January to March this year. Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, has 300 rivers and ditches, and 100 were treated last year, and all the remaining 200 were dredged and cleared in the first half of this year; at the same time, all open ditches in the city have been converted into covered ditches, eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds, and greatly reducing the incidence of malaria and gastrointestinal infectious diseases.

Now, all provinces and cities are working harder, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and preparing to launch a high tide of pest and disease control blitzes in close combination with production before the autumn harvest.

    紧密结合生产开展大规模的卫生突击活动
    全国城乡大力除害灭病
    城市：消灭蚊蝇、预防夏秋季传染病、积肥支援农村、改善环境卫生
    农村：开展积肥运动、管好粪便、改善公共食堂卫生、防治寄生虫病
    新华社24日讯　从全国城市到农村，目前正在掀起一个大规模的夏秋季除害灭病、讲卫生运动。城市以消灭蚊蝇、预防夏秋季传染病，大力积肥支援农村，改善环境卫生为中心；农村结合生产开展积肥运动，做好粪便管理工作，改善公共食堂卫生；在血吸虫病流行地区，以消灭血吸虫病为主，带动防治其他寄生虫病。
    最近，北京、上海、安徽、江苏、湖南等省、市先后召开了除害灭病的业务会议，加强和健全了除害灭病队伍，有些省、市决定从现在到秋收前，结合生产再掀起几次卫生工作高潮。上海市市区从7月初起，在各级党委书记的领导下，前后展开了多次大规模的突击活动，逐步深入地消灭蚊蝇孳生地，扑灭蚊蝇，并且为郊区积送了大批肥料。四川省成都市全面调查了蚊蝇孳生地，部署了灭蝇灭蚊工作。
    这些省、市的农村和郊区对夏季卫生工作也抓得很紧。湖南省桂阳县的三百五十多名医务人员，同全县二千八百多名基层保健员一起组成一百七十六个田间医疗站、三百六十五个巡回医疗组，到农村开展夏季卫生防疫运动，并协助四千一百二十四个公共食堂组织送茶水组，保证给田间及时供应开水。郴县专区耒阳县田间有凉棚、?笠、开水桶和防暑药，农业劳动保护工作作得很好。涟源县许多食堂实行了食物有纱罩，食具消毒，和用地窖冷藏食物等办法，夏季传染病大大减少。
    有血吸虫的地区，正在继续消灭钉螺、加强粪便管理，积极防治。安徽省准备在7、8月间对全省应受检查的人口，作一次到两次粪便检查，并加强病人治疗工作。江西省玉山县最近全面整顿了粪便管理制度，做到新粪不下田，全县所有的血吸虫病人，最近即可基本治完。
    今年上半年，全国除害灭病工作，在去年大跃进的基础上，取得了新的成绩。各省市的除害灭病爱国卫生运动最大的特点是紧密结合生产。不少地区结合春耕、兴修水利，开展除害灭病工作，做到生产卫生两不误。江西省结合田间管理以及修整排水灌溉渠道，对灭螺不彻底的水田沟渠普遍作了一次小面积的突击灭螺运动；在插秧、莳田、耘禾时，每隔三天到五天就在田内撒茶子饼肥一、二次，既施了肥，又消灭了钉螺。上海市区今年在讲卫生除七害的爱国卫生运动的基础上，开展了多次“大搞积肥，支援农村，改善环境卫生”的突击运动，据统计在运动中积了二百四十三万多吨肥料；上海郊区正在密切结合生产和积肥，开展除害灭病和消灭钉螺的活动。
    由于各地区今年除害灭病工作比较深入细致，一些流行病的急性感染、发病率都较往年为少。今年各地湖水上涨得快，打涝湖草的时间也早，参加的人数又多；但由于加强个人防护，并及早修桥、筑路，使打湖草的人减少了与疫水接触的机会，做到安全生产。湖南省十二个县七十一个公社今年有十三万人打湖草，基本上未发生集体感染事故。各地疟疾的抗复发工作，也抓得很紧，同时，慎重地利用了药物防治，使疟疾复发率大大降低。根据湖南、贵州两个省的统计，去年和前几年疟疾发病人数已逐年减少，今年前五个月又比去年同期的发病人数减少了80％以上；贵州盘县往年疟疾发病情况相当严重，今年元月到3月仅有七人发病。浙江省杭州全市有三百条河沟，去年处理了一百条，今年上半年又把其余二百条全部打捞、疏通；同时，全市所有明沟都已改为暗沟，消灭了蚊蝇孳生地，疟疾、肠胃传染病率大大降低。
    现在各省、市正以更大的干劲，学先进赶先进，准备在秋收前紧密结合生产掀起一个除害灭病突击运动高潮。
