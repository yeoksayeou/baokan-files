    The Epic of the Polish Workers' Movement
    ——Reading the Polish Novel "A Man's Road"
    Sun Wei
    After its publication in 1952, the Polish writer Igor Newerly's novel "A Man's Road" (originally titled "Memoirs of a Fiber Factory") aroused great interest and affection among Polish readers. Some people constantly inquired about who the prototype of the protagonist Szczęsny in the book was, and some even thought they had found him. Some were eager to know the whereabouts of an old printing press of the Polish Communist Party called "Julian" described in the book. Others were eager to read the sequel to this novel as soon as possible. Therefore, the author had to answer the above questions separately in the postscript to the fifth edition of this book.
    This book not only narrates the tortuous life of a worker, but also depicts the changes in a worker's life and understanding over twenty years, as well as the era and the revolutionary forces that played a role in that era. This book tells us so much! The protagonist of the book, Szczęsny, followed his parents from Polish under the rule of the Tsar to Russia, and then from post-revolutionary Russia back to Polish ruled by the bourgeoisie. When they were in a foreign land, the "idyllic life" of the Polish countryside made them think about it day and night, but the real Polish countryside had no place for them to stand, and they were finally driven into the industrial centers of the city. It was not easy for Szczęsny to become a worker, he had to bribe the accountant, become a tool to lower other people's wages, and be used by the Christian trade union. Once he gained a firm foothold in the ranks of the workers, he was still followed by miserable days: working to live, and studying to climb up. He saw that the "red elements" were really fighting, but he was unwilling to give up everything and embark on this road, and the tendency of individual struggle dominated him. Vulgar love made him feel the coldness of society even more. Although his experience during military service improved his understanding somewhat, it was the Polish Communist Party that really pointed out the way for him. When he was most depressed, he happened to meet a strange girl - an underground worker of the Party - in a park near the station. After listening to his autobiography, she analyzed the reasons for him and pointed out the way out. The girl told him that he felt despair because he had left his own people, and that he would pay a very high price for doing so, or he would still try his best to run around and live an ordinary life, or he would go to the enemy's side and get rich by oppressing others; therefore, he should return to his own class and fight with them. After he found the Party organization and joined the Party's work, he was criticized by his comrades for his recklessness and individualism, but he could not accept it. At this time, the Party sent an experienced old comrade, Oleniczak, to talk to him. By the bonfire on the bank of the Vistula River, Oleniczak saw and analyzed the errors in his thinking. Oleniczak pointed out that his tendency to appreciate himself must be eliminated, because the development of this tendency would make people look down on everything and feel that the working class and the people are nothing great. He pointed out that he was consumed by the fire of hatred and did not care enough about his closest relatives. Oleniczak also told him in a stern tone: "We are fighting for communism. What attitude should you take? You should be like a little soldier! As long as you are in the team for one day, you must complete one task, and then complete another task... Always, for a lifetime, be a communist, without any remuneration, and always be loyal - only then can you fulfill the responsibilities of a communist!" Szczęsny did not disappoint the Party's advice and hopes, he continued to work actively and gradually matured. He finally grasped the truth after a long struggle.
    Through Szczęsny's experience, the author also wrote about several important aspects of Polish life in the 1920s and 1930s: the differentiation of the countryside and the improvement of peasant awareness, the development of the revolutionary struggle of the working class, the activities of the bourgeoisie and the church who were enemies of the workers, as well as the army life and the fate of intellectuals in capitalist Polish. The history of the struggle of the Polish Communist Party occupies a major place in the book, and many of its episodes and leading figures are written vividly and lively. Therefore, it can be said to be an epic of the nature of the literature of the Polish workers' revolutionary movement.
    The writer Igor Newerly is fifty-six years old this year. Before becoming a writer, he worked as a carpenter, stenographer, proofreader, bookbinder, and editor. During the Second World War, he was detained in Hitler's concentration camp, and later joined the Polish Workers' Party. "A Man's Road" is his third work and won the first prize of the Polish National Award in 1952. In order to conceive this book, he consulted many archives, read many materials, talked to many people related to the events written in the book, carefully selected the most necessary things from all of this, and completed this book after arduous creation.
      "A Man's Road" is full of boundless optimism about the revolutionary struggle of the workers. This is not only because the book truthfully reflects the development of Polish history, but also because the author has a high degree of loyalty and enthusiasm for the cause of the working class, and he regards writing for the working class as his noble "duty and glory". Many scenes in the book are written excellently and powerfully, and the images of many characters are carved like reliefs, which arouse strong love and confidence in the readers' hearts.

    波兰工人运动的史诗
    ——读波兰小说“一个人的道路”
    孙玮
    波兰作家伊戈尔·聂维尔利的长篇小说“一个人的道路”（原名“纤维工厂回忆录”）1952年出版后，在波兰读者中引起了极大的兴趣和好感。有些人不断询问书中的主角施泽斯尼的原型是谁，甚至也有人自以为已经找到了他。有些人很想知道书中描写的波兰共产党的一架名叫“朱丽安”的旧印刷机的下落。也有些人很渴望早些读到这部小说的续篇。因此，作者不得不在这本书的第五版后记中对上述问题分别作了解答。
    这本书不但叙述了一个工人的曲折的生平，而且描写了一个工人在二十年间的生活与认识的变化，同时也描写了那个时代，以及在那个时代中起革命作用的力量。这本书告诉了我们多少事情啊！书的主人公施泽斯尼从沙皇统治下的波兰跟随父母到了俄国，又从革命后的俄国回到资产阶级统治的波兰。他们身处异乡时，波兰农村的“田园生活”曾使他们昼思夜想，然而真实的波兰农村却没有他们的立足之地，他们终于被赶入城市的工业中心。施泽斯尼想做个工人也非易事，他得向帐房行贿，做压低别人工资的工具，受基督教工会的利用。当他一旦在工人的队伍中站稳了脚，跟着来的仍然是苦恼的日子：工作是为了活着，学习是为了向上爬。他看出“红色分子”才真正在战斗，但他还不愿放弃一切走上这条道路，个人奋斗的倾向支配了他。庸俗的爱情使他更感到社会的冷酷。服兵役期间的遭遇虽然提高了一些他的认识，但真正给他指出道路的却是波兰共产党。他最苦闷的时候，在车站附近的公园里偶然遇见了一个陌生的少女——党的地下工作者，她听了他的自叙后，给他分析了原因，指点了出路。这个少女告诉他，他感到绝望是因为离开了自己的人，这样做他会付出极高的代价，或者他将仍然尽力钻营而庸庸碌碌地过完一生，或者他将走到敌人那边去，靠压迫别人发财致富；所以，他应当回到自己的阶级里去，跟他们共同斗争。当他找到党的组织，参加了党的工作以后，为了那种轻举妄动和个人英雄主义，他受了同志们的批评，但是他接受不了。党在这时派了一位久经锻炼的老同志奥列尼查克去和他交谈。在维斯杜拉河岸上的篝火堆旁，奥列尼查克看出了也分析了他的思想上的错误。奥列尼查克指出他的孤芳自赏的倾向必须消除，因为这种倾向发展下去会使人目空一切，会觉得工人阶级和人民都没有什么了不起。指出他被仇恨的烈火吞噬了，对最亲近的人也不够关心。奥列尼查克还用严峻的语气告诉他：“我们是为共产主义作战。你采取的应该是什么态度呢？应当像一名小兵似的！只要你在队伍里一天，就要执行完一个任务，再执行一个任务……永远、一辈子作个共产党员，没有任何报酬，永远要赤胆忠心——这才算尽到一个共产党员的职责！”施泽斯尼没有辜负党的忠告和希望，他继续积极工作，逐渐成熟。他在长期斗争之后终于掌握了真理。
    通过施泽斯尼的经历，作者还写出了本世纪二十和三十年代波兰生活中的几个重要方面：农村的分化与农民觉悟的提高，工人阶级革命斗争的发展，与工人为敌的资产阶级和教会的活动，以及资本主义波兰的军队生活、知识分子的命运等等。波兰共产党的斗争史在书中占了主要的地位，它的不少插曲和领导人物都写得鲜明而生动。因此，可以说它是波兰工人革命运动文献性质的史诗。
    作家伊戈尔·聂维尔利今年五十六岁，在成为作家之前，他做过木匠、速记员、校对、订书匠、编辑。第二次世界大战期间他曾被拘留在希特勒的集中营里，后来参加了波兰工人党。“一个人的道路”是他的第三部作品，曾获得1952年波兰国家奖金一等奖。他为了构思这本书，曾查考过许多档案，阅读过许多材料，同许多与书中所写的事件有关的人谈过话，仔细从这一切中选择了最必需的东西，经过艰苦的创作完成了这部书。
      “一个人的道路”充满了对工人革命斗争的无限乐观精神。这除了因为全书真实地反映了波兰历史的发展外，同时也因为作者对于工人阶级的事业有着高度的忠诚与热情，他把为工人阶级写作看成是他的崇高“义务与光荣”。书中的许多场面写得出色有力，许多人物的形象刻画得像浮雕似的，它在读者心中引起的是强烈的爱与信心。
