    Strive to Develop Medicinal Material Production
    People's Daily Commentator
    Traditional Chinese medicine is the material foundation for TCM doctors to treat diseases. Developing medicinal material production not only plays a huge role in enhancing people's health and accelerating the country's socialist construction, but also has a very close relationship with developing the diversified economy of people's communes and increasing commune income.
    Since the State Council issued instructions on developing medicinal material production last year, medicinal material production has attracted attention in various regions. In addition to expanding the production base of authentic medicinal materials, many regions have also actively carried out introduction and trial planting work according to the principle of "local production, local supply, and transforming wild medicinal materials into domestic cultivation." Yunnan Province has planted 125 kinds of medicinal materials, covering more than 110,000 mu, an increase of more than three times compared with last year. The main varieties include Chinese goldthread, gastrodia elata, and costus root. Sichuan Province has trialed the planting of 60 kinds of wild medicinal materials, among which gastrodia elata, fritillaria, pinellia, rhizoma cimicifugae, and typhonium flagelliforme have obtained relatively mature cultivation experience. Hangzhou Medicinal Plant Farm in Zhejiang has sown and collected more than 700 kinds of medicinal materials this year, including introduced varieties and wild varieties transformed into domestic cultivation, striving to reach 1,200 kinds. Due to the implementation of the principle of grasping both production area and unit yield, the planting area of medicinal material production in many provinces and regions has been significantly expanded, and the unit yield has also been greatly improved. According to surveys by relevant departments, by the end of June, 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions had planted approximately 2.81 million mu of various medicinal materials, an increase of more than 800,000 mu compared with the actual sown area of 1.94 million mu nationwide in 1958. Some regions have already seen some examples of high yields, such as Zhejiang's fritillaria, which increased production by 20%. At present, most of the domestically cultivated Chinese medicinal materials are in the growing period. The current task is to improve cultivation techniques, ensure the vigorous growth of medicinal materials, and strive to increase the yield per unit area in order to further meet the needs of the national health care cause for medicinal materials and increase commune income.
    Medicinal materials are technical crops, and good production and collection techniques are required for the smooth development of medicinal material production. Therefore, it is very necessary to give full play to the role of veteran medicinal farmers, humbly learn from them, take veteran medicinal farmers as teachers, invite them to provide technical guidance, and carefully summarize their experiences. Many places have already created a lot of experience in this regard. Wuxi County, Sichuan Province, trained more than 130 technical cadres through short-term training courses. Now, there are more than 1,000 commune members in the county who are familiar with medicinal material production, achieving that every commune has a technical team and every production team has a technician.
    Currently, it is the busy farming season in summer. The sowing season for some summer-sown medicinal materials has arrived. All medicinal material producing areas should incorporate medicinal material production into the local agricultural production plan and strive to fully complete and overfulfill the medicinal material sowing task. Health, commercial, agricultural, and forestry departments should closely cooperate and work together to actively do a good job in supplying seeds and materials for summer-sown medicinal materials. Last year, medicinal material management units in various regions adopted the method of signing medicinal material production and purchase contracts with communes and production brigades, which played a significant role in promoting the planned development of cultivated medicinal materials, and should continue to be adopted and promoted this year.
    Conscientiously implementing the Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture, strengthening field management, and carrying out a large-scale high-yield movement to greatly improve the yield and quality of medicinal materials are another important key to ensuring a bumper harvest of medicinal materials this year. All regions should ensure timely sowing of summer-sown medicinal materials and allocate a certain amount of labor to carry out field management, so that the management work of cultivation, weeding, disease prevention, insect control, topdressing, and watering of medicinal fields can keep up.
    80% of China's medicinal materials are wild plants. Important varieties such as licorice and rhubarb are all wild. Managing and collecting wild medicinal materials well is of great significance to the entire medicinal material production. The cultivation management and collection of wild medicinal materials should implement methods such as zoned management, zoned collection, digging large ones and leaving small ones, digging and planting simultaneously, and cyclical hunting, combining digging medicinal materials with nurturing, long-term interests with current interests, so as to ensure that the production of various wild medicinal materials increases year by year and meets the medical needs of the people. The collection and purchase of wild medicinal materials should be carried out by adopting the methods of "small-scale efforts during busy farming seasons, large-scale efforts during slack farming seasons," and "local production, local purchase, and local processing." There are many varieties of wild medicinal materials, production is scattered, and seasonality is strong, so it is necessary to organize collection in a timely manner according to the harvesting season of different medicinal materials. This year, Guangdong and Shandong have been paying close attention to wild medicinal materials, and the honeysuckle purchase situation is good. However, in some areas, the purchase of wild medicinal materials is not progressing rapidly, and measures must be taken to catch up quickly, otherwise, great losses will be caused if the opportunity is missed.

    努力发展药材生产
    本报评论员
    中药是中医治病的物质基础。发展药材生产不仅对增强人民体质、加速国家社会主义建设有巨大作用；而且对发展人民公社多种经济，增加公社收入，也有十分密切的关系。
    自去年国务院发布关于发展药材生产的指示以后，药材生产已引起各地重视。不少地区除了扩大地道药材生产基地外，还根据“就地生产，就地供应和变野生药材为家种家养”的方针，积极进行了引种、试种工作。云南省已种药材一百二十五种，十一万余亩，比去年增加三倍以上，其中主要品种有黄连、天麻、木香等。四川全省试种野生药材共六十种，其中天麻、贝母、半夏、升麻、南星等已获得比较成熟的种植经验；浙江杭州药物种植场今年已下种和收集引种、野生变家种的药材有七百多种，争取达到一千二百种；不少省区的药材生产由于贯彻了既抓生产面积又抓单位产量的方针，种植面积有了显著的扩大，单位产量也有了很大的提高。据有关部门调查，到6月底止，二十七个省、市、自治区已种植各种药材二百八十一万亩左右，比1958年全国实际播种面积一百九十四万亩增加了八十多万亩。部分地区已经出现了一些丰产典型，如浙江的贝母增产20％。目前大部分家种中药材正在生长期间，当前的任务是改进栽培技术，保证药材生长茁壮，努力提高单位面积的产量，以进一步满足国家卫生保健事业对药材的需要和增加公社收入。
    药材是技术作物，需要有较好的生产技术和采集技术，才能使药材生产顺利发展。因此，充分发挥老药农的作用，虚心向他们学习，拜老药农为师，请他们作技术指导，认真总结他们的经验，是十分必要的。这方面很多地方已经创造了不少的经验。四川巫溪县通过举办短期训练班，培训了技术干部一百三十多人，现在全县熟悉药材生产的社员共有一千多人，达到了社社有技术组、队队有技术员。
    当前正是夏季农忙季节。有些夏播药材的下种季节已到。各药材产区应该把药材生产安排到当地农业生产规划之内，力争全面完成和超额完成药材播种任务。卫生、商业、农林部门要密切配合、紧密协作，积极作好种子供应和夏播药材的物资供应。各地药材经营单位去年采取与公社、生产大队签订药材生产、收购合同的办法，对促进栽培药材有计划的发展发挥了很大的作用，今年还应继续采用和推广。
    认真贯彻八字宪法，加强田间管理，开展大面积丰产运动，大力提高药材产量和品质，是保证今年药材丰收的又一个重要关键。各地对夏播药材应该切实作到适时播种，并抽出一定力量进行田间管理，使药田的中耕、除草、防病、除虫、追肥、浇水等管理工作跟上去。
    我国药材80％是野生植物。甘草、大黄等重要品种，都是野生的。管好采好野生药材，对整个药材生产有重大的意义。对野生药材的培育管理和采集工作，应该实行分区管理、分区采集、挖大留小、边挖边种、轮回猎取等办法，把挖药和抚育、长远利益和当前利益结合起来，这样才能保证各种野生药材年年增产，满足人民医疗需要。对于野生药材的采集、收购工作，应当采取“农忙小搞，农闲大搞”，以及“就地生产，就地收购，就地加工”的办法进行。野生药材品种很多，生产分散，季节性强，因此必须按照不同药材的采挖季节及时组织采集。今年广东、山东对野生药材抓的紧，金银花收购情况良好。但是，有些地区野生药材收购进展不快，必须采取措施迅速赶上，错过时机，就会造成很大损失。
