Strive for a Bumper Oil-Tea Harvest
By Our Correspondent

With the overall Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the general improvement of people's living standards, the demand for both industrial and edible oils has greatly increased. To actively solve this problem, in the current oil production, in addition to expanding the planting area of herbaceous oil crops such as peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, and flax, and increasing the yield per unit area of these crops, we should also vigorously promote woody oil crops, especially oil-tea production.

Oil-tea has many advantages: it has a long lifespan, generally bearing fruit for decades to a century, and is the most promising oil tree species in more than a dozen southern provinces. It does not compete with grain and cotton for land. With careful management, it can yield abundantly and profitably every year. Oil-tea forests have a strong ability to resist natural disasters such as floods and droughts, and the yield is stable. Therefore, developing oil-tea production can not only rationally utilize land and increase oil production, but also is an important production undertaking to prosper the mountain economy and increase the income of commune members.

In the past ten years, national oil-tea production has greatly developed, and the output has increased year by year. Last year, there were also large-scale high-yield examples such as the Yichun Raoshi Commune in Jiangxi Province, with more than 16,000 mu of oil-tea forest, averaging 50 jin of oil per mu; and the Bailu Brigade of the Gongping Commune in Leiyang County, Hunan Province, with more than 2,500 mu of oil-tea forest, averaging 81 jin of oil per mu. The area of newly planted young forests has more than doubled that of the original mature forests. Due to the rapid-growth and high-yield measures taken for these young forests, some oil-tea trees have already flowered and borne fruit within two or three years. These examples all eloquently illustrate that oil-tea is not a low-yield oil crop, nor is it a "distant water". As long as attention is paid to deep cultivation and diligent maintenance, and appropriate fertilization is applied, high yields can be achieved, and benefits can be obtained in a relatively short period of two or three years.

In order to further develop mountain production, carry out diversified operations, and produce more oil as soon as possible, the people's communes in the oil-tea producing areas of the southern provinces should seriously value oil-tea production. The Party committees at all levels in the producing areas should put oil-tea production on the agenda. In the spirit of overall planning and comprehensive consideration, they should uniformly arrange labor and effectively lead oil-tea production, overcoming the ideas of neglecting oil-tea production that still exist in some people's communes and among the masses. In the current oil-tea production, we should mainly grasp the two important keys to increasing production: reclamation and cultivation. The production experience of the broad masses has proved that a barren tea mountain, once reclaimed, can "benefit in the same year, increase production in the second year, and have a bumper harvest in the third year." At present, there are still nearly 9 million mu of oil-tea that have not been reclaimed nationwide, with extremely low yields or no harvest. Reclaiming these tea mountains can add a strong new force to oil-tea production. For the reclaimed tea mountains and newly planted young oil-tea forests, cultivation should be carried out every year to make them bear fruit early and bear more fruit. In addition, the harvesting of tea fruits should be well organized, and good harvesting can greatly increase the yield.

Giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses in managing oil-tea production is a very important key to promoting oil-tea abundance. The people's communes in various producing areas should correctly handle the issue of income distribution and labor remuneration. We must adhere to the principle of distribution according to work, more work more pay, and implement the policy of unified recording of work points for agriculture and forestry and unified distribution at the end of the year. The practice of some places that list the reclamation of oil-tea as compulsory labor without recording work points is inappropriate. In order to improve labor efficiency, we should also implement a production responsibility system such as contracting for work, contracting for output, setting tasks, setting regions, setting quality, setting time, setting work points, and rewarding increased production, with more rewards for more increases.

There is work to do in managing oil-tea forests throughout the year. In order to ensure the smooth progress of production, people's communes and production brigades with large areas of oil-tea forest, concentrated in continuous tracts, and a large proportion of oil-tea income, should fix a certain number of laborers to form specialized teams or oil-tea farms, so that seasonal concentrated production and the perennial management of specialized teams can be combined. This is beneficial to both agricultural production and oil-tea production. Hunan and Zhejiang provinces have more than 5,000 such professional organizations. All localities can also promote this practice according to their local conditions.

Developing oil-tea production has significant economic significance. Counties and communes in the producing areas must actively lead this oil-tea production, which is closely related to the lives of commune members and has great potential for increasing production, and strive for a greater oil-tea harvest.

    力争油茶大丰收
    本报评论员
    随着工农业生产的全面大跃进和人民生活的普遍提高，不论生产用油和食用油，需要量都大大增加了。为了积极地解决这一问题，在当前的油料生产上，除了扩大花生、芝麻、油菜、胡麻等草本油料作物的播种面积，提高这些作物的单位面积产量外，还应该大抓木本油料作物，特别是油茶生产。
    油茶有很多优点：它寿命长，一般能结实几十年到百年，是南方十几个省区最有发展前途的油料树种。它不和粮、棉争地。只要注意经营，就可年年丰产、年年有收益。油茶林抗御水旱等自然灾害的能力很强，产量稳定。因此，发展油茶生产，不仅可以合理利用土地，增产油料，而且是繁荣山区经济，增加社员收入的一项重要的生产事业。
    十年来，全国油茶生产有很大发展，产量逐年提高，去年还出现了江西宜春绕市公社一万六千多亩油茶林，平均亩产油五十斤；湖南耒阳县公平公社白露大队二千五百多亩油茶林，平均每亩产油八十一斤等大面积高产典型。新造的幼林面积，已经超过原有成林二倍以上。这些幼林由于采取了速生丰产措施，有些油茶在两三年内就已开花结果。这些事例都雄辩地说明，油茶不是低产油料作物，也不是“远水”，只要注意深垦勤修，适当施肥，就能达到高产，就能在两三年的较短时间内得到收益。
    为了进一步发展山区生产，开展多种经营，尽快地生产更多的油料，南方各省油茶产区的人民公社应该认真重视油茶生产，产区的各级党委应该把油茶生产列入议事日程，本着统筹兼顾精神，统一安排劳力，切实把油茶生产领导好，克服仍存在于部分人民公社和群众中的轻视油茶生产的思想。在当前的油茶生产中，主要应抓住垦复和抚育这两个重要的增产关键。广大群众的生产经验证明，荒芜的茶山一经垦复就可以“当年得利，二年增产，三年大丰收”。目前全国还有近九百万亩油茶没有垦复，产量极低或没有收成。把这些茶山垦复过来，就可以为油茶生产增加一支强大的生力军。对已经垦复的茶山和新造油茶幼林，应年年进行抚育，使它们早结实，多结实。此外，还应很好组织茶果的采收工作，采好收好，可以增加很大的产量。
    充分发挥群众经营油茶生产的积极性，是促使油茶丰产的一个十分重要的关键。各产区人民公社应该正确处理收益分配问题和劳动报酬问题。要坚持按劳分配、多劳多得的原则，并实行农林统一记工年终统一分配的方针。有些地方把垦复油茶列为义务工不记工分的作法是不妥当的。为了提高劳动效率，还应当实行包工、包产、定任务、定地区、定质量、定时间、定工数以及增产奖励，多增多奖等生产责任制。
    经营油茶林一年四季都有活干，为了保证生产工作顺利进行，凡是油茶林面积大，集中成片，油茶收入比重很大的人民公社、生产大队，应当固定一定数量的劳动力成立专业队或油茶林场，使季节性的突击生产和专业队的常年经营相结合。这样，既对农业生产有利，也对油茶生产有利。湖南和浙江两省有五千多个这样的专业组织。各地也可根据本地情况推广这一作法。
    发展油茶生产具有重大的经济意义。产区县、公社一定要把这个与社员生活息息相关，增产潜力很大的油茶生产积极领导起来，力争油茶更大的丰收。
