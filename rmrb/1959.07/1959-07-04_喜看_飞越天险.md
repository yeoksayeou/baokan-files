    Joyfully Watching "Flying Over Natural Barriers"
    Xie Fengsong
    I watched "Flying Over Natural Barriers" twice, and both times I felt joyful and excited.

    Our country's southwest, the Kangzang Plateau, is over 5,000 meters above sea level, with constant wind and snow all year round, and glaciers that do not melt even in summer. Before liberation, the American and Chiang Kai-shek air forces dreamed of opening a route here; however, glaciers and blizzards repeatedly buried them on the plateau. They had to designate this place as an "air forbidden zone." In 1950, our young People's Air Force, with revolutionary heroic spirit, driving captured clumsy, dilapidated transport aircraft, stubbornly overcame various difficulties, flew over the natural barriers, and unprecedentedly opened the Beijing-Lhasa route in this "air forbidden zone." The film depicts these heroic deeds. The film divides the development of the dramatic plot into "land and air advances." On the ground, it writes about the comrades of the weather team on the Kangzang Plateau, in the glaciers and snow-capped mountains, where they encountered the collapse of the snow mountain, and fought against hunger, cold, and illness to ensure the task of opening the route; although the radio was broken and they could not contact the troops, they still bravely moved forward, not afraid of hardship, in the desperate situation. It also writes about their close relationship with the Tibetan villagers. In the air, it writes about the spirit of utter selflessness and class love among the pilots; it writes about the No. 803 aircraft taking off twice, returning twice, and flying over the natural barriers for the third time, turning danger into safety, and winning the revolutionary heroism. The underground and above-ground lines are closely connected and closely related: the underground weather team is the "ears and eyes of the pilots" preparing to fly over the natural barriers and open the route, and they are their pioneers; the pilots in the sky later "combined the tasks of rescue and opening the route," and became the rear supporters of the underground weather team. They are closely linked in their careers and destinies, dependent on each other for survival. The pilot Zhao Zhongkai in the sky and the weather team member Xu Rui underground are also a young couple, and there is also a line of love between them. In this way, the two lines are intertwined, twisted into one, rigorous and compact, and exciting. In addition, the comrades in charge of art (including special effects art), scenery, lighting, and photography (including special effects photography) are serious, meticulous, and careful, and the underground and above-ground environments are treated realistically, laying a credible foundation for the development of the plot.

    In the shaping of characters, Zhao Zhongkai and Zhang Qiliang can be called twin璧. Their first impression is: two very friendly young men, playful, enthusiastic, simple, and full of vigor, they have the same aspirations and different personalities.

    Let's look at this scene: they are speeding on the road on motorcycles. In order to allow Zhao Zhongkai to make it in time to see Xu Rui off, Zhang Qiliang grabbed the car and drove it himself; the car drove too fast, fell into the ditch, Zhang Qiliang asked Zhao Zhongkai to run forward, and carried the car alone. Several actions, a few words, profoundly wrote their deep friendship, mutual care, and consideration; at the same time, it also began to expose the impatient and reckless side of Zhang Qiliang's personality, setting off Zhao Zhongkai's calm, steady, and slightly shy personality. When flying over Guitou Pass for the second time, Zhang Qiliang was determined to complete the task, ignoring the complex changes in the climate, and resolutely advocated rushing through; the captain Zhao Zhongkai ordered a return, and he even quarreled with him. Back at the base, Zhang Qiliang was like a fully inflated ball, butting heads everywhere. For Zhao Zhongkai, saving the comrades of the weather team, and his lover, he was not in a hurry? But he can use reason to restrain his emotions, he thought of "not only to drill in, but also to think about how to drill out." Here, his calmness, composure, and maturity are shown, as well as Zhang Qiliang's enthusiasm and recklessness. At the end, when the plane lacked oxygen, Zhang Qiliang first took off his mask, preferring to sacrifice himself and leave the oxygen to the co-pilot Zhao Zhongkai to complete the task of opening the route.

    These concise descriptions have created two distinct images. When the film expresses the inner world of the characters, it does not resort to lengthy dialogues, but through the extremely concentrated and concise actions of the characters. Like the third take-off through the cave, hovering over the sea of clouds to find the weather team, repeatedly contacting them, but not getting a reply, and consuming too much oxygen, Zhao Zhongkai decided to return. At the moment of moving the steering wheel, his face suddenly sank, which fully expressed Zhao Zhongkai's extremely painful mood of realizing that the comrades of the weather team and his lover Xu Rui might have sacrificed. Later, after the contact was made and the plane dropped the supplies, Zhang Qiliang winked at Zhao Zhongkai knowingly. This wink also overflowed with very deep friendship.

    Fully utilizing the characteristics of the film, using the extremely concise actions of the characters to show the characters' inner hearts and to portray the characters' personalities is another success of the film.

    The film's description of the No. 803 aircraft flying into the blue sky three times can be regarded as a wonderful stroke. The same people, the same plane, flying into the same sky, but each time it gives people a different feeling, a different impression, and does not feel any repetition. The author made careful designs.

    The first time: the take-off shots are connected very clearly, neatly, quickly, and compactly. The characteristic of the voyage is climbing, and the left engine malfunctions.

    The second time: at take-off, the commander pointed to the map, told the flight crew to remember the code name of the mountain pass, and immediately prepared to take off; then, the plane appeared in the clouds. During the voyage, the main thing was to discover climate change, Zhang Qiliang advocated crossing the mountain pass, and Zhao Zhongkai ordered a return.

    The third time: before take-off, Zhao Zhongkai and Zhang Qiliang each talked to the chief, and at the end of the talk, the camera switched to the inside of the aircraft cabin, where Zhang Qiliang and Zhao Zhongkai each winked, indicating reconciliation. The characteristic of the voyage was to pass through the cave, hover over the sea of clouds for a long time to rescue the comrades of the weather team, and then the oxygen was insufficient, and the plane almost had an accident. At the airport landing, the people who came to welcome, the people who came to rescue, cheered.

    Three times, each time has its own characteristics, each time has its own attractive place, one time is like a wave, one time is a climax, waves push waves, climaxes follow climaxes, forming the rapid rhythm and majestic style of the film.

    The ancient saying goes that a well-written article is "completed in one breath," and "Flying Over Natural Barriers" can also be said to have a feeling of being completed in one breath. However, in some places, because the foreshadowing before the play and the connection between the atmosphere before and after are not given enough attention, although there are no flaws in the picture, it gives people a slightly unreal and unnatural feeling. Like the collapse of the snow mountain, because of the lack of due rendering of this event in advance (only Xiao Tao's "If a piece of soil collapses, will we still be alive?" sentence), it makes people feel a little sudden, and does not give the audience a greater shock. The weather team's singing while marching, and reciting Chairman Mao's "Qing Ping Yue" (Liupanshan) when trapped, the prior atmosphere preparation is not enough, and it also makes people feel unnatural. The author did not put much effort into the secondary line of the weather team, and the lack of organic and coherent descriptions makes the infection and impression given to people relatively superficial.

    喜看“飞越天险”
    谢逢松
    两次看“飞越天险”，两度欢悦和激动。
    我们祖国西南的康藏高原，拔海五千公尺以上，风雪长年不断，冰山盛夏不化，气候十分恶劣。解放前，美蒋空军梦想在这里开辟一条航线；可是，冰山和风雪一次次让他们葬身在高原之上。他们不得不把这里划为“空中禁区”。1950年，我们年轻的人民空军，却以革命的英雄气概，驾驶着缴获来的笨重、破旧的运输机，顽强地克服各种困难，飞越天险，史无前例地在这个“空中禁区”，开辟了北京—拉萨航线。影片拍摄的就是这些英雄事迹。影片将戏剧情节的发展，分“陆、空两路进军”。在地上，写气象三组同志在康藏高原的冰山雪岭中，他们遇到了雪山的崩溃，为了保证开辟航线的任务，与饥饿、寒冷、伤病作斗争；虽然电台摔坏了无法与部队联络，在濒于绝望的困境中，仍勇往直前，不畏艰苦。也写了他们与藏族老乡的亲密关系。在空中，写飞行员之间的大公无私、舍己为人的阶级友爱精神；写八零三号飞机二次起航、二次返航和第三次飞越天险，化险为夷，获得胜利的革命英雄主义。地下和天上两条线联系密切，息息相关：地下的气象组，是天上准备飞越天险、开辟航线的“飞行员的耳朵和眼睛”，是他们的先行者；天上的飞行员，后来把“营救和开辟航线的任务结合起来搞”，又成了地下气象组的后援者。他们在事业上，在命运上，紧密相连，互依为存。天上的飞行员赵忠凯和地下的气象队员徐瑞，又是一对年轻的恋人，彼此之间还拴着一条爱情的线。这样，两条线相互交错，拧成一气，严谨紧凑，扣人心弦。再加上负责美术（包括特技美术）、布景、照明、摄影（包括特技摄影）等工作的同志，认真、严肃、细致，把地下和天上的环境气氛处理得逼真，给故事情节的发展打下了可信的基础。
    在人物的塑造上，赵忠凯和张启良，堪称双璧。他们给人的第一个印象是：两个非常友爱的小伙子，俏皮、热情、纯朴、富有朝气，他们有相同的志向和不同的性格。
    且看这一场戏：他们骑着摩托车在马路上疾驰着。张启良为了让赵忠凯能赶上时间去给徐瑞送行，自己抢过车来驾驶；车开得太猛，掉进沟里，张启良又叫赵忠凯跑步前进，自己单独背着车子走。几个动作，几句话，深刻地写了他们的深厚友谊，互相照顾和体贴；同时，也开始暴露了张启良性格中性急、冒失的一面，衬托出了赵忠凯性格中的沉着、稳健和略带腼腆。当第二次飞临鬼头山口时，张启良一心要完成任务，不顾气候的复杂变化，坚决主张冲过去；机长赵忠凯下令返航，他竟和他吵起来。回到基地后，张启良像一个打足气的皮球，到处顶撞。对赵忠凯来说，救气象队的同志，还有他爱人，他何尝不急呢？但他能以理智去克制感情，他想到“不光是钻进去，还要想到怎样钻出来”。这里显出他的冷静、沉着和成熟和张启良的热情和莽撞。到最后飞机缺乏氧气时，张启良却首先取下了自己的面罩，宁愿牺牲自己，把氧气留给正驾驶赵忠凯，来完成开辟航线的任务。
    这些简炼的描绘，塑造出了两个性格鲜明的形象。影片在表露人物内心世界的时候，不是借助冗长的对话，而是通过人物极集中、极简炼的动作。像第三次起飞穿过山洞，在云海上盘旋寻找气象三组，再三联络，得不到回答，氧气消耗过多，赵忠凯决定返航。就在搬动方向盘的一刹那，他的脸一阵铁沉，便充分表达了赵忠凯意识到气象组同志、爱人徐瑞可能牺牲的万分痛苦的心情。后来，联络上了，飞机投下了物资，赵忠凯正与徐瑞通话，张启良冲着赵忠凯会意地眨了一下眼睛。这眼睛一眨，便又溢出了十分深厚的友情。
    充分利用电影的特性，借助人物十分简炼的动作，来展现人物的内心，来刻划人物的性格，这是影片的又一成功之处。
    影片对803号飞机三上青空的描写，可以算得一种妙笔。同样的人，同样的飞机，上同样的天空，但每次都给人不同的感觉，不同的印象，不觉得有任何的重复。作者作了费心思的设计。
    第一次：起飞的一组镜头，连接得非常清楚、利落，速度快，很紧凑。航行时的特点是爬高，左发动机发生故障。
    第二次：起飞时，是团长指着地图，叫飞行人员记住山口代号，马上准备起飞；接着，飞机就在云头出现了。航行时，主要是发现气候变化，张启良主张过山口，赵忠凯命令返航。
    第三次：起飞前是赵忠凯和张启良各找首长谈话，谈话将结束时，接着是空中飞机机舱内，张启良和赵忠凯各一眨眼，表示和好。航行时的特色，是穿过山洞，为营救气象组同志，在云海上长久盘旋，后氧气不足，飞机险些出事的情景。在机场着陆，欢迎的人，准备来抢救的人，一片欢呼。
    三次，每次有它的特色，每次有它引人的地方，一次像一个浪头，一次是一个高潮，浪头推浪头，高潮接高潮，形成了影片急促的节奏，浩阔磅礴的风格。
    古语说文章写得好，“一气呵成”，“飞越天险”，也可以说有一种一气呵成的感觉。不过，在个别地方由于戏前的伏笔准备，前后气氛的贯串注意得不够，画面虽无破绽，却给人略有不真实、不自然的感觉。像雪山的崩溃，因为事先缺乏对这一事件的应有的渲染（只有小陶“你说要是塌下一方土来我们还有命不”一句话），便使人觉得有些突然，并没有给观众更大的震惊。气象组行进时的唱歌，受困时朗诵毛主席的“清平乐”（六盘山），事前的气氛准备都不够，也使人觉得不够自然。气象组这条副线，作者倾力不多，缺乏有机、连贯的描写，给人的感染和印象也就比较粗浅了。
