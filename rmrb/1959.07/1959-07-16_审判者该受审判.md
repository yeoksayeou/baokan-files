Notes
    The judge should be judged
    While the Athens Military Tribunal is conducting trials of Glezos and other patriots, a scandal has been exposed: the mastermind behind this trial, the Greek Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Minister of Public Order and Security, Karantzis, is the very person who ordered the release of Nazi war criminal Tschörner. A police officer named Vasilatos, who works at the passport control office in the port of Piraeus, Greece, has sworn to confirm this matter. This news has aroused great anger among the Greek public.
    Such a thing is not surprising. Those who hate patriots are bound to be traitors, and those who persecute national heroes are bound to be national scum. What clean history do the Greek reactionaries have? However, the exposure of Karantzis's scandal will make the Greek people understand that they should not only stop the Greek reactionaries' trial of Glezos, but also need to judge the scum who have betrayed and are betraying national interests!

    审判者该受审判
    在雅典军事法庭正在对格列索斯和其他爱国者进行审讯的时候，一件丑事被揭发：这次审讯的主谋人希腊外交副大臣兼公共秩序和治安副大臣卡兰齐斯就是曾经下令释放希特勒战犯称尔维斯的那个人。在希腊佩雷港口护照检查处工作的警察瓦西拉至斯发誓证实这件事情。这一消息引起希腊公众的极大愤怒。
    这种事情本来毫不奇怪的。痛恨爱国者的必然是卖国贼，迫害民族英雄的必然是民族败类。希腊的反动分子那有什么历史干净的家伙？不过卡兰齐斯的丑事的被揭发，却会使希腊人民明白，他们现在不仅应当要制止希腊反动派对格列索斯的审讯，而且需要审讯曾经出卖和正在出卖民族利益的败类！
