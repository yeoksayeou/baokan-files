Planned Breeding, Planned Pig Sales
Duanjiazuo Production Team Adds Piglets and Sells Fat Pigs Every Month

(Reported by our newspaper) The Duanjiazuo Production Team of Tangfeng People's Commune in Shen County, Hebei Province, has adopted a method that combines planned breeding with planned pig sales, separate trough feeding with dedicated management, and collective raising with household raising, to develop pig production. According to current statistics, the production team now raises 1,178 pigs, averaging six per household, an increase of more than four times compared to the same period last year. Among them, 1,100 commercial pigs have been cultivated, and the entire team guarantees to sell one fat pig to the state per person this year.

In the past, the Duanjiazuo Production Team lacked planning in breeding piglets, which caused the breeders to be busy and unable to take care of all the pigs properly, failing to ensure the survival of all the piglets. At the same time, it was also easy to form a situation where there were too many pigs that were not well fed, gained weight slowly, and could not be sold to the state in a timely manner according to national needs. To change this situation, Guo Ying, the Party branch committee member in charge of pig raising, and the breeders jointly studied and made breeding plans for more than 100 sows: 23 pigs bred in July, 20 in August, 25 in September, 24 in November, and 28 in December. Because of the implementation of planned breeding, the breeders took good care of the newborn piglets, and each piglet was plump and strong. When breeding piglets, the production team also adopted a system of hanging signs in the pigsties and registering boars and sows, recording the age, breed, number of pigs, etc., to select better piglets and eliminate inferior breeds, gradually realizing the improvement of pig breeds.

While planning the breeding of piglets, the team closely integrated the pig sales plan to fill vacant spots and maintain the number of pigs. In addition to selling 341 commercial pigs to the state in the first half of the year, the production team plans to sell 75 pigs to the state in July, 80 in August, 70 in September, 85 in October, 90 in November, and 100 in December. Because the plan is specific, the breeders are enthusiastic about feeding the pigs, and the plan is implemented and fulfilled month by month, the commercial pigs sold are large and fat, generally weighing more than 120 catties each.

The Duanjiazuo Production Team has adopted the method of separate trough feeding and dedicated management to promote pig growth. The breeders unanimously believe that there are many shortcomings in feeding large and small pigs together: the large pigs cannot eat enough, the small pigs cannot eat well, and the strong pigs chase the weak pigs. To avoid this phenomenon, the pigs are divided into categories: adult pigs, "Kerlang" (young pigs), piglets, and sows, and separate trough feeding is implemented. Dedicated personnel are also assigned to management, and a four-fixed responsibility system is implemented (fixed number of heads, fixed number of workdays, fixed feed, and fixed manure accumulation). Although the production team pays great attention to the feeding of pigs, it also pays special attention to the principle of thrift in running the pig farm. Without brick-built pens, flat-ground pig pens are built; ditches are dug around the pens, and bathing pools and pig troughs are set up in the middle, so that the pigs can bathe, cool off, and eat. Because the past method of small-pen feeding has been changed, the large and small pigs rarely get sick, and even less often get mange, develop faster, and can accumulate a large amount of fertilizer.

While developing collective pig raising, the Duanjiazuo Production Team actively helps commune members raise pigs. For households with financial difficulties, the pig farm lends piglets, which are gradually returned to the pig farm at a price discounted for fertilizer. When arranging production, the production team sets aside a certain amount of time for commune members to collect and plant feed for the pigs. The manure accumulated by commune members from raising pigs is priced according to its quality and purchased by the cooperative. Because of these measures, the commune members are competing to buy pigs and repair pigsties. On June 5th alone, 86 pigsties were repaired, and 150 pigs were bought in five days, achieving pig raising in every household and manure accumulation in every pigsty.

In the past few years, the Duanjiazuo Production Team has changed the past barren appearance of the land through pig raising and manure accumulation, turning weak land into fertile garden fields. Originally, the yield of the sandy land here was very low. In 1957, after raising more than 200 pigs in the whole village, five carts of manure were applied to each mu of land, and the average yield per mu was 200 catties. In 1958, each household developed to three pigs, 20 carts of fertilizer were applied to each mu of land, and the average yield per mu increased to 606 catties. With the development of pigs, the increase in fertilizer, and the increase in yield, the commune members have generally tasted the sweetness of raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer. This year, they have conscientiously implemented the principle of walking on two legs in pig raising, and quickly reached an average of six pigs per household, and each mu can be applied with more than 30 carts of standard manure. The commune members said: As long as we do a good job in raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, sandy land can also be turned into a high-yield area. Through pig raising, the commune members have also increased their income. As of the beginning of July this year, the income from pig raising alone was more than 16,000 yuan, of which the pig capital was only 8,000 yuan. Now 70% of households have savings.

    计划繁殖　计划售猪
    段家佐生产队月月添小猪月月卖肥猪
    本报讯　河北深县唐奉人民公社段家佐生产队，采取计划繁殖和计划售猪相结合、分槽喂养和专人管理相结合、集体养和户养相结合的办法，发展养猪生产。据目前统计，这个生产队已养猪一千一百七十八头，平均每户达到六头，比去年同期增加四倍多；其中还培养商品猪一千一百口，全队保证今年每人卖给国家一口肥猪。
    段家佐生产队过去在繁殖仔猪当中，由于缺乏计划，造成饲养员看管忙乱，照顾不周，不能保证仔猪全部成活；同时也容易形成猪多吃不好，上膘慢，不能按照国家需要，适时地将猪卖给国家。为了改变这个情况，负责养猪工作的党支部委员国英同志和饲养员共同研究，对一百多头母猪作了配种计划：7月份配种的生猪二十三头，8月份二十头，9月份二十五头，11月份二十四头，12月份二十八头。由于实行计划繁殖，饲养员对初生的小猪照管周到，小猪个个膘肥体壮。这个生产队在繁殖仔猪的时候，还采取了猪窝挂牌和公母猪登记的制度，记录公母猪的年龄、品种、生猪多少等，以便挑选较好的猪秧，淘汰劣等猪种，逐步实现猪只优种化。
    在计划繁殖仔猪的同时，紧密结合售猪计划，弥补空位，保持猪只的数量。这个生产队，除前半年售给国家商品猪三百四十一口外，今年下半年分批培养的肥猪，计划在7月份售给国家七十五只，8月份八十只，9月份七十只，10月份八十五只，11月份九十只，12月份一百只。由于计划具体，饲养员喂猪热心，计划月月落实兑现，出售的商品猪又大又肥，一般均在一百二十斤以上。
    段家佐生产队采取分槽喂养和专人管理的办法，促进猪只生长。饲养员一致认为：大小猪在一起喂养缺点很多：大猪吃不饱，小猪吃不好，壮猪赶着弱猪跑。为了避免这种现象的发生，把猪划分为：成猪、克郎、小猪、母猪等，实行分槽喂养。还确定了专人管理，推行了四定责任制（定头数、定工数、定饲料、定积肥）。这个生产队虽然很注意猪只的饲养工作，同时也特别注意勤俭办猪场的原则。没有砖垒圈，就建立平地猪圈；圈的周围挖有围沟，当中设有沐浴池、猪槽，猪只可以洗澡、乘凉、吃食。由于改变了过去的小圈喂养方法，大小猪很少生病，更不生螫子，发育较快，并能积大批肥料。
    段家佐生产队，在发展集体养猪的同时，主动帮助社员养猪。对生活有困难的户，猪场借给猪秧，以肥折价的办法逐渐归还猪厂原本。生产队在安排生产时，给社员留出一定的时间，以便给猪采集和种植饲料。社员养猪积肥以质论价，由社收购。由于采取这些措施，社员们争先恐后买猪修圈。6月5日一天，就修好八十六个猪圈，五天买猪一百五十口，达到户户养猪，圈圈积肥。
    几年来，段家佐生产队通过养猪积肥，改变了过去土地瘠薄的面貌，使弱地变成肥沃的园田。原来这里的沙地产量很低。1957年全村养猪二百多头后，每亩地施上五车圈肥，平均亩产量二百斤。1958年每户发展到三口猪，每亩地施肥二十车，平均亩产提高到六百零六斤。随着猪只的发展，肥料的增加，产量的提高，社员普遍尝到养猪积肥的甜头，今年认真执行了两条腿走路的养猪方针，很快达到平均每户六头猪，每亩能施上标准圈肥三十多车。社员们说：只要搞好养猪积肥，沙地也能变成高产区。通过养猪，还使社员增加了收入。今年截至7月初，养猪一项收入一万六千多元，其中猪本不过八千元。现在70％的户都有存款。（附图片）
