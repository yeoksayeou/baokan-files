　　In the Second All-Army Art Performance, many excellent performance songs appeared, such as the General Headquarters and Departments' amateur performance team's "Six Great Personnel," the Wuhan amateur performance team's "Two Photos," the Beijing Military Region Song and Dance Troupe's "Singing of the Glorious Eight Great Personnel," and the Wuhan Military Region Song and Dance Troupe's "Finding a Groom." These programs not only selected suitable themes for performance songs from different aspects of life, but also endowed them with vivid and moving images in music and performance. There was no affectation or pretension, and no simple pursuit of stage effects divorced from life. Instead, they brought audiences educational and meaningful enjoyment with simple performances and plain, accessible musical language. What is particularly exciting is that, due to the rapid progress of our real life, when the existing forms of small choruses and performance songs could no longer meet people's demands, larger-scale singing performances (including chorus, unison singing, poetry recitation, rap, and even a certain amount of dance) were created on this basis, such as the Beijing amateur performance team's "Field Camping Drill Suite," the Chengdu Military Region Song and Dance Troupe's "Red Flag of the Daba Mountains," and the Wuhan Military Region Song and Dance Troupe's "Seeing Off Model Workers to Beijing." Although these programs all have shortcomings of varying degrees or in different aspects, such as "Red Flag of the Daba Mountains" being a relatively good large chorus, it has not yet been able to better combine the existing distinct Sichuan folk song style and moving melody with the chorus, to more fully develop the role of the chorus, resulting in insufficient emotional depth. In addition, whether such complex sets and such a large performance are necessary is also worth studying, because its dramatic and specific environmental requirements are not as needed and urgent as opera, and doing so weakens its due appeal to the audience. "Field Camping Drill Suite" is a healthy, lively, and very characteristic work, but in terms of lighting and sets, it also has the same shortcomings as "Red Flag of the Daba Mountains." "Seeing Off Model Workers to Beijing," although it has moving scenes, lacks some moving melodies. But in general, these works are quite successful and relatively excellent. Especially in terms of performance form, I think it is a very meaningful creation. In addition, the "Sichuan Opera Singing" and "Henan Opera Singing" in the small chorus also brought new brilliance to the entire evening with their creativity, bringing new inspiration for inheriting and developing tradition.
　　In addition, precisely because the above programs still have shortcomings—either inappropriate selection of materials or excessive performance, or too heavy sets—comrades have generated another view: watching the performance is not as good as a play, and listening to the music is not rich enough. But I think that since it is a singing performance, it should not be required according to the requirements of "drama," nor should singing and performance be separated. Because it is a unified whole that requires both listening and watching; otherwise, even opera would become a problem: Should we watch or listen? Is it to make up for the song with the performance or to make up for the performance with the song? In fact, no one raises such a question, because if it is opera, it requires both watching and listening; it emphasizes both singing and performance. Large chorus performances should naturally be different from opera. If it is called a large chorus or suite or small chorus, it should focus on singing and music, with performance as an auxiliary, and should not be the tail wagging the dog. The main problem of today's performance songs is probably here. But this is obviously not the fault of the performance song itself, because in fact there are many excellent performance songs, and there are also many unsatisfactory unperformed songs. Moreover, even operas that emphasize both performance and singing still have good and bad ones. Therefore, I think the creation of the "large chorus performance song" form, like the creation of new opera, is inherited from tradition and comes from the masses. We should value it, cherish it, develop it, and improve it, so that it can become our tradition like opera and small chorus, and become a new flower in our art garden.
　　But this does not mean that the direction or ultimate goal of chorus is performance song, and only in this way is it called inheriting tradition, promoting tradition, and being creative. Our tradition is multifaceted. Classical music, opera music, folk music, revolutionary songs, etc., should all be regarded as our tradition. And no matter what form the author uses to create, as long as the ideology and artistry are strong and the quality is high, it will inevitably have its high creativity. If we are merely creating for the sake of creation, or regard performance as the best and only form, it will bring such a bad result—not "letting a hundred flowers bloom," but "one flower blooms alone while a hundred flowers wither."

    珍贵的收获
    时乐蒙
    在全军第二届文艺会演中，出现了许多优秀的表演唱，如总直业余演出队的“六大员”，武汉业余演出队的“两张照片”，北京部队文工团的“歌唱光荣的八大员”，武汉部队文工团的“找新郎”等，这些节目不但从不同的生活面选择了适合表演唱的题材，而且在音乐上，表演上又都赋予了鲜明、动人的形象，没有矫揉做作，没有离开生活而单纯去追求舞台效果，而是以朴素的表演，平易、通俗的音乐语言给观众带来了富有教育意义的观赏。尤其令人兴奋的是，由于我们的生活现实是在这样飞跃前进，当已有的小合唱表演唱的形式已不能满足人们的要求时，便在这个基础上创造了较大型的歌唱表演（包括合唱、齐唱、诗朗诵、说唱，甚至一定份量的舞蹈），如北京业余演出队的“野营合练组歌”，成都部队文工团的“大巴山的红旗”，武汉部队文工团的“欢送劳模上北京”等。这些节目尽管还都有着不同程度或不同方面的缺点，如“大巴山的红旗”是一个较好的大合唱，但还未能将已有的较鲜明的四川民歌风格、动人的旋律与合唱更好地结合起来，更丰富的发挥合唱的作用，致使感情不够深厚；另外是否需要这样复杂的布景和这样大的表演，也还值得研究，因为它的戏剧性和特定环境的要求不像歌剧那样需要和迫切，这样做反而削弱了它对听众应有的感染力。“野营合练组歌”是一个健康、活泼很有特性的作品，但在灯光、布景方面，也有和“大巴山的红旗”同样的缺点。“欢送劳模上北京”虽有动人的场面，但还缺少些动人的旋律。但总的说来，这些作品是相当成功的，较优秀的作品。尤其在表演形式上我认为是个极有意义的创造。另外，小合唱中的“川剧演唱”、“河南梆子演唱”，也同样以其创造性给整个晚会带来了新的光彩。给继承发展传统带来了新的启示。
    另外，正因为以上节目还存在着缺点——或选材不当，或表演过多，布景过重等，致使同志们产生了另外一种看法——看表演不如戏，听音乐又不丰富，但我想既是歌表演，就不应按“剧”的要求来要求它，也不应该把唱与表演分开来看。因为它是既要听也要看的统一的整体，否则连歌剧也成问题了，到底是要看呢还是要听？是以表演弥补歌呢还是以歌来弥补表演呢？实际上并没有人提这样问题，因为它是歌剧就既要看也要听，它是唱、演并重。大合唱表演自然应与歌剧有所区别，既叫大合唱或组曲或小合唱，就应以唱、以音乐为主，表演为辅，不能喧宾夺主。今天表演唱的主要问题恐怕就在这里。但这显然不是表演唱本身的过错，因为事实上的确有不少优秀的表演唱，也有许多不能令人满意的不表演的唱。何况演、唱并重的歌剧也还有好坏之分。因之我认为“大合唱表演唱”形式的创造也正像新歌剧的创造一样，是继之传统，来自群众，我们应当重视它、爱护它、发展它、提高它，使它同歌剧、小合唱一样成为我们的传统，成为我们艺术园地里的一朵新花。
    但这并不是说合唱的方向或最后目的就是表演唱，只有这样才叫继承传统，发扬传统，才叫有创造性。我们的传统是多方面的，古典音乐、戏曲音乐、民间音乐、革命歌曲等都应视作我们的传统。而且不管作者采用那种形式进行创造，只要思想性、艺术性强，质量高，也都必然有其高度创造性。如果说我们仅仅是为了创造而创造，或把表演视作最好的、唯一的形式的话，那将会带来这样的恶果——不是“百花齐放”，而是“一花独放百花衰”。
