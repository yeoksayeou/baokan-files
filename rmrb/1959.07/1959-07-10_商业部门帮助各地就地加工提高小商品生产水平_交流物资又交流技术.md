Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: Recently, commercial departments in many regions, while organizing material exchanges, have launched mass technical exchange activities, effectively promoting the development of small commodity production.

China's bamboo, wood, rattan, willow, grass, and other raw materials and waste resources for producing small commodities are very abundant. However, due to inconsistent technical conditions, some regions can use these resources to produce small commodities, while others cannot; some regions have high production efficiency and good product quality, while others are the opposite. Seeing this situation, commercial departments in many regions have adopted the method of organizing technical exchanges to help the people in raw material producing areas learn and improve their skills, utilize local raw materials to produce small commodities, reduce the frequent transfer of raw materials and small commodities, and at the same time resolve the contradictions between supply and demand.

The activities of commercial departments in various regions to organize technical exchanges and promote the development of small commodity production have been widely carried out since the National Exchange Conference on Daily Sundries and Local and Special Products held in May. At this meeting, initially, representatives from various regions requested the supply of 70 million straw sacks, but the supply was only 450,000. The meeting organized representatives from Shanghai to demonstrate the technique of weaving straw sacks with wooden machines to representatives from various provinces and cities. After watching the demonstration, representatives from various provinces and cities learned the technique of weaving straw sacks. All regions with rice straw or other substitute raw materials changed their minds about purchasing from outside and decided to produce straw sacks themselves. On this basis, regions with and without technology signed technical cooperation agreements, and the straw sack supply problem was satisfactorily resolved. This vivid example made commercial departments in various regions realize the importance of organizing technical exchanges for developing small commodity production.

The methods of technical exchange in various regions can be summarized as follows:

First, the sales areas provide technical support to the raw material producing areas, and the raw material producing areas support the sales areas with products. For example, the Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Purchasing and Supply Station needs alkali, and Sichuan Province has a large amount of alkali-making raw materials but lacks production technology and equipment. Recently, both parties agreed that the Shanghai Chemical Station would assist the Sichuan Provincial Commercial Department's Native Products Trading Bureau in establishing an alkali plant using cotton peach shells as raw materials. Half of the products produced by this plant will be supplied to the Shanghai Chemical Station. Xinjiang has a large amount of cattle and sheep blood, which was wasted in the past. Recently, relevant departments in Xinjiang and the Tianjin Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company and other departments signed a technical cooperation agreement. The Tianjin Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company will send technicians to Xinjiang to help make blood meal from cattle and sheep blood. Xinjiang will then supply blood meal to Tianjin and other places as raw materials for industrial and fishery production.

The second form is to learn from each other's technologies, learn from each other's strengths, and improve together. The advantage of this form is that it can concentrate the advantages of various productions, so that the production departments in various regions can master the complete set of advanced technologies and generally improve production. For example, Yunnan Province has a long history of producing wax insects, and Sichuan Province has relatively high wax coating technology. Historically, Yunnan has supplied wax insects to Sichuan, and Sichuan Province has produced white wax. Recently, both parties signed an agreement. Yunnan will send people to Sichuan to learn wax coating technology, and Sichuan will send people to Yunnan to learn insect breeding technology. In this way, both provinces will be able to raise wax insects and coat wax, and they will be able to produce more white wax.

The third form is that technologically advanced regions send technicians with machines and tools to regions with raw materials to teach technology and help the producing areas develop production. For example, the Songjiang County Commercial Bureau in Shanghai sent three technicians to Ningxia to teach rope making and straw sack weaving techniques. Hebei Province also sent reed mat weaving technicians with weaving tools to Yunnan to teach mat weaving techniques.

The fourth form is that raw material producing areas send people to technologically advanced areas to learn. For example, the Ningxia Commercial Department sent people to Guangdong Province to learn the technology of weaving cattail bags, and then returned to their region to promote it.

In addition to the above forms, various regions have also widely exchanged technical experience through holding on-site meetings, exchanging drawings, samples, and books and materials, which has also played a certain role in promoting small commodity production.

    商业部门帮助各地就地加工提高小商品生产水平
    交流物资又交流技术
    新华社9日讯　最近，许多地区的商业部门在组织物资交流的同时，展开了群众性的技术交流活动，有力地促进了小商品生产的发展。
    我国各地的竹、木、藤、柳、草等生产小商品的原料和废品资源十分丰富。但是，由于技术条件不一致，有些地区能利用这些资源生产小商品；有些地区则不能利用；有的地区生产效率高、产品质量好，有的则相反。不少地区的商业部门看到这种情况，就采用组织技术交流的办法，帮助原料产地的人民学会和提高技术，利用当地原料生产小商品，减少原料和小商品的频繁调运，同时解决供求之间的矛盾。
    各地商业部门组织技术交流，促进小商品生产发展的活动是在5月份召开的全国日用杂品和小土特产品交流大会以后广泛开展起来的。在这个会上，起初各地代表要求供应七千万条草袋子，而货源只有四十五万条；会议就组织上海市代表向各省、市代表表演了用木机织草袋的技术，各省、市代表看过上海代表的表演以后，学会了织草袋的技术，凡是有稻草或有其他代用原料的地区，都改变了向外采购的主意，决定自己生产草袋子。在这一基础上，有技术和无技术的地区签订了技术协作协议，草袋子供应问题得到圆满解决。这一生动的事例，使各地商业部门认识到组织技术交流对发展小商品生产的重要意义。
    各地技术交流的方法归纳起来大概有以下几种：
    第一是销地在技术上支援原料产地，原料产地以产品支援销地。如上海市化工原料采购供应站需要碱，四川省有大量的造碱原料，但是缺乏生产技术和设备，最近双方协议，由上海化工站协助四川省商业厅土产贸易局建立一个以棉桃壳为原料的制碱厂，这个厂生产出来的产品以一半供应上海化工站。新疆有大量的牛羊血，过去都白白浪费掉了，最近新疆有关部门和天津市水产供销公司等部门签订了技术协作协议，由天津市水产供销公司派技术人员去新疆帮助用牛羊血制成血粉，新疆再以血粉供应天津等地，作为工业、渔业的生产原料。
    第二种形式是互相学习技术，取长补短，共同提高。这种形式的好处是，可以集中各个生产的优点，使各地的生产部门都能掌握全套的先进技术，普遍提高生产。如云南省生产蜡虫有悠久的历史，四川省挂蜡技术比较高，历来是云南供应四川蜡虫，四川省生产白蜡。最近双方签订了协议，云南派人到四川学习挂蜡技术，四川派人到云南学习养虫技术，这样，两省都会养蜡虫和挂蜡，就可以增产更多的白蜡。
    第三种形式是，有技术的地区派出技术人员携带机器工具到有原料的地区传授技术，帮助产地发展生产。如上海市松江县商业局派出技术人员三人到宁夏传授打绳、织草袋技术。河北省也派编织苇席的技术工人，携带编织工具到云南传授编席技术。
    第四种形式是，原料产地派人到有技术的地区去学习。如宁夏商业厅派人到广东省学习编织蒲包的技术，学会后再回本区推广。
    除去以上几种形式以外，各地还通过召开现场会议、交换图纸、样品和图书资料等方式，广泛交流技术经验，对促进小商品生产，也起了一定的作用。
