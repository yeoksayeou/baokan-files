Xinhua News Agency dispatches: The illegal sentencing of Glezos and other Greek patriots by the Greek authorities has aroused indignation among the public and media in various countries. They have condemned the illegal actions of the Greek authorities and demanded the restoration of freedom for Glezos and other patriots.

The Soviet "Izvestia" published an observer's article on the 23rd, pointing out that the Greek military court's trial of Glezos and other Greek democrats was the most frantic attempt by reactionaries to persecute opponents of their own ideas. Its purpose is to destroy the Greek people's resistance to the policy of turning Greece into an American atomic rocket base, which violates national interests.

The people of Czechoslovakia held rallies to protest the sentencing of Glezos and other Greek patriots. More than 10,000 working people in Prague held a rally in Julius Fučík Park on the 23rd. Prominent Czech writer Gusta Fučíková and others spoke at the meeting, condemning the unjust verdict of the Greek authorities and demanding the restoration of freedom for Greek patriots.

People from all walks of life across Hungary also held rallies and sent telegrams to the Greek authorities, protesting the illegal trial by the Greek military court and demanding the immediate release of Glezos and other patriots. All major Hungarian newspapers published articles on the 23rd, resolutely protesting the verdict of the Greek authorities.

The Polish "People's Tribune" published an article stating that the Greek authorities' verdict was unjust, and its purpose was to prevent Glezos from continuing to fight for peace and progress, while at the same time diverting Greek society's attention from the authorities' domestic and foreign policies.

The German Committee for the Release of Glezos emphasized in a statement that the shameful verdict of the Athens court makes it the duty of all honest people to continue the struggle to release all those convicted more actively.

On the 23rd, all major Bulgarian newspapers published articles and interviews with some prominent Bulgarian lawyers, unanimously condemning the trial farce directed by the Greek government in order to suppress the domestic progressive movement.

Professor Iomascu, Chairman of the Romanian National Committee for the Defense of Glezos, Academician Horia Hulubei, Vice-Chairman of the Romanian Standing Committee for the Defense of Peace, and Academician Beniuc, First Secretary of the Writers' Association, all published articles in newspapers, demanding the release of Glezos and other Greek patriots.

The Albanian "People's Voice" published a commentary on the 23rd, pointing out that the struggle of the Greek people and all peace-loving people has saved the lives of Glezos and others, which is a great victory. But the struggle is not over, and Glezos and other patriots must be released.

The Administrative Committee of the Greek United Democratic Left Party published a statement in "Avghi" on the 23rd, pointing out that despite the lack of any evidence, the reactionary authorities still sentenced Glezos and others to heavy sentences. The verdict shows that the court's purpose is to slander the democratic movement, to attack the Greek United Democratic Left Party through the persecution of Glezos, to attack the patriotic movement, and to incite hostility and divisive movements. The statement called for the abolition of emergency laws (including Law No. 375), and also demanded that the Greek Communist Party be legalized. The statement pointed out that the illegal trial of Glezos and other democrats has prompted all progressive and conservative forces in Greece to unite to defend democracy. Those who oppose the normalization of the domestic situation, represented by the government, are completely isolated. The statement emphasized that they should understand that violence cannot destroy the struggle for democracy.

The statement called on the people of all countries to step up the struggle for Glezos's freedom.

"Avghi" also published statements from Greek legal workers who defended Glezos and other democrats. They protested the court's verdict in their statements.

In Britain, Mald, the secretary of the progressive legal workers' organization "Haldane Society," said that legal workers around the world will continue to work to release Glezos and his comrades.

The French democratic public also angrily protested the Greek authorities' unjust verdict against Glezos and other patriots. Paris's "L'Humanité" wrote that the court did not dare to sentence Greek patriots to death because the world public that stood up to support them clearly knew that they were innocent.

The newspaper went on to say that two of them were sentenced to life imprisonment. And Glezos, the hero of the Acropolis who had twice been sentenced to death and whose health had been damaged in prison, is now back in jail.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：希腊当局非法判处格列索斯及其他希腊爱国者徒刑和重刑的行为，激起了各国公众和舆论的愤慨。他们纷纷谴责希腊当局的非法行为，并且要求恢复格列索斯等爱国者的自由。
    苏联“消息报”23日发表的观察家的文章指出，希腊军事法庭对格列索斯和希腊其他民主人士的审讯是反动派迫害自己思想的反对者的一次最丧心病狂的尝试。其目的在于摧毁希腊人民对变希腊为美国原子火箭基地的违反民族利益的政策的反抗。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民纷纷举行集会，抗议对格列索斯等希腊爱国者的判决。一万多名布拉格劳动人民23日在尤利乌斯·伏契克公园举行了集会。捷克斯洛伐克著名作家古丝妲·伏契科娃等人在会上讲话，谴责希腊当局的不公正的判决，要求恢复希腊爱国者的自由。
    匈牙利全国各地各界人士也纷纷集会和致电希腊当局，抗议希腊军事法庭的非法审判，并且要求立即释放格列索斯和其他爱国者。匈牙利中央各报23日都发表文章，坚决抗议希腊当局的判决。
    波兰“人民论坛报”发表文章说，希腊当局的判决是不公正的，其目的在于使格列索斯不能再继续为和平、进步事业进行斗争，同时以此来转移希腊社会对当局内外政策的注意。
    德国要求释放格列索斯委员会在声明中强调指出，雅典法庭的可耻判决使全体正直的人士有义务更积极地继续进行争取释放所有被定罪的人的斗争。
    23日，保加利亚中央各报刊登了保加利亚一些著名的律师的文章和谈话，一致谴责希腊政府为了镇压国内进步运动而导演的审判丑剧。
    罗马尼亚保卫格列索斯全国委员会主席约马斯库教授、罗马尼亚保卫和平常设委员会副主席霍里亚·胡卢贝院士和作家协会第一书记贝纽克院士都在报纸发表文章，要求释放格列索斯和希腊其他爱国者。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”23日发表评论指出，希腊人民和一切爱好和平的人们的斗争拯救了格列索斯等人的性命，这是一个巨大胜利。但是斗争并未结束，必须释放格列索斯等爱国者。
    希腊统一民主左翼党行政委员会23日在“黎明日报”上发表一篇声明指出，尽管缺乏任何证据，反动当局仍然判处格列索斯等人重刑。宣判结果表明，法庭的目的是要诽谤民主运动，通过对格列索斯的迫害来打击希腊统一民主左翼党，打击爱国运动以及煽起敌对和分裂运动。声明要求废除非常时期法律（其中包括第三百七十五号法律），还要求使希腊共产党合法。声明指出，法庭对格列索斯和其他民主人士的非法审讯促使希腊一切进步力量和保守力量团结起来保卫民主。以政府为代表的反对国内局势正常化的人完全陷入了孤立。声明强调指出，他们应该理解到，暴力不能摧毁争取民主的斗争。
    声明号召世界各国人民加紧争取格列索斯自由的斗争。
      “黎明日报”还刊载了替格列索斯和其他民主人士辩护的希腊法律工作者的声明。他们在声明中纷纷抗议法庭的判决。
    在英国，进步法律工作者的组织“哈尔丹协会”的秘书马尔德说，全世界的法律工作者将继续努力，争取释放格列索斯和他的同志们。
    法国民主公众也愤怒抗议希腊当局对格列索斯和其他爱国者的不公正判决。巴黎“人道报”写道，法庭不敢判处希腊爱国者死刑，因为，起来声援他们的全世界公众都清楚地知道，他们是无辜的。
    报纸接着说，但是他们中间的两位爱国者被判处了无期徒刑。而曾经两度被判处死刑、并且在监狱里损害了健康的希腊卫城英雄格列索斯，如今又被关入了牢房。
