    Peddler Sails Across the Ocean
    A cargo ship, fully loaded with non-staple foods and daily necessities, set sail from Yantai City, braving the wind and waves, heading straight for the East China Sea operating area.
    This cargo ship was jointly organized by the employees of the Gongli Market and the Department Store in Yantai City. When they heard that more than 800 crew members of the Aquatic Products Company were staying in the open air for a long time on more than 30 fishing boats in the open ocean to maintain production, they quickly realized that the crew members must be in great need of daily necessities. So they brought vegetables, biscuits, vermicelli, sweets, cooking oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, canned goods, daily necessities, etc., and sailed to various fishing boats in this operating area to supply them.
    When this cargo ship sailed into the fishing ground, it was welcomed by the crew members. The crew members said gratefully: You are so thoughtful, we will definitely catch more fish to support you in doing a good job in supply.

    货郎乘船泛远洋
    一只满载副食品和日用百货的货船，从烟台市出发，乘风破浪，直奔东海作业区。
    这只货船是烟台市公利市场和百货商店的职工们共同组织的。当他们听说水产公司的八百多名船员乘着三十多只渔轮，长期露宿远洋坚持生产的消息后，很快就想到船员们一定很需要一些生活日用品。他们于是携带了蔬菜、饼干、粉丝、糖果、油盐酱醋、罐头、日用百货等，乘船到这个作业区的各渔轮供货。
    当这只货船驶进渔场的时候，受到船员的欢迎。船员们感激地说：你们做的太周到了，我们一定多捕鱼，支援你们做好供应工作。
