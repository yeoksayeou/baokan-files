Moscow dispatch, July 10th: According to Soviet newspapers, the vast majority of large industrial enterprises, construction sites, collective farms, and state-owned farms throughout the Soviet Union have established People's Volunteer Patrols. They have already had a very positive impact on organizing the broad masses to maintain social order.

The People's Volunteer Patrols in various parts of the Soviet Union were established in accordance with the resolution "On the Participation of Working People in Defending National Social Order" adopted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union in early March this year. The Soviet Minister of Internal Affairs, Dudorov, recently gave an interview to a "Izvestia" reporter on the situation of the establishment of People's Volunteer Patrols in various parts of the Soviet Union based on the above-mentioned resolution in the past four months.

Dudorov said that the Soviet Party and government are firmly implementing the decision of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on transferring some functions of state organs, including the organs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, to social organizations. The establishment of People's Volunteer Patrols has laid the foundation for transferring some functions of the organs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to social organizations, a major event of great political significance.

Dudorov pointed out that the resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union "On the Participation of Working People in Defending National Social Order" is an important milestone on the road of further developing Soviet democracy. Party organizations, Soviets, and Communist Youth League organizations in various parts of the Soviet Union have done a lot of work in organizing People's Volunteer Patrols in accordance with this resolution. In the past four months, the organizational form of the People's Volunteer Patrols has basically taken shape. The People's Patrols of industrial enterprises, collective farms, and state-owned farms in various regions are generally composed of employees and members of the unit alone, but some People's Volunteer Patrols are jointly composed of employees and members of several small enterprises or farms. Throughout the country, tens of thousands of advanced workers, farm members, and intellectuals who enjoy prestige among the masses and are respected by the masses participate in People's Volunteer Patrols. In addition, headquarters of People's Volunteer Patrols have also been established in cities and districts, led by experienced leaders of local Party organizations, Soviets, or Communist Youth League organizations.

The People's Volunteer Patrols are independent social organizations of the working people. They are not responsible to the police agencies, but work under the supervision of the local Party committees and Soviets. The main direction of their activities is to focus their main efforts on preventing possible illegal acts among those poorly educated and low-conscious citizens, especially young people.

People's Volunteer Patrols in various places often cooperate with the Communist Youth League organizations to organize seminars in workshops, fields, or dormitories to discuss the moral outlook of Soviet people and the code of conduct in life, production, and society. People's Volunteer Patrols are resolutely eliminating the roots of behaviors that are licentious, undisciplined, and harmful to social order.

Now, the People's Volunteer Patrols in various parts of the Soviet Union have become a powerful social force. After the establishment of the People's Volunteer Patrols in the Upper Isetsk Steel Rolling Mill in Sverdlovsk Oblast, the social order here has been significantly improved compared to before. The number of people summoned to the police agencies for violating social order has been greatly reduced, and absenteeism and lateness in the factory have also been greatly reduced. The People's Volunteer Patrols in the Stalinino, Dnepropetrovsk, and Logansk Oblasts of the Ukrainian Republic, under the leadership of the Oblast Party organizations, have carried out extensive educational work among young miners to prevent undisciplined behavior and actions that harm social order. Many criminals have been handed over to comrades' courts for education. The vast majority of these criminals have begun to embark on the right path after social education.

Because the People's Volunteer Patrols have absorbed the broad masses to actively participate in the struggle to protect social order, the Soviet police agencies are now able to concentrate their main forces on performing their main responsibilities—reforming those who seriously violate the norms of socialist society and cannot be educated.

Minister of Internal Affairs Dudorov pointed out that, of course, transferring certain functions of the state to social organizations does not mean weakening the role of the socialist state and state organs in the construction of communism. The implementation of certain functions of the state by social organizations will only further expand and strengthen the political foundation of Soviet society and will only ensure the further development of socialist democracy.

    维护国家社会秩序　保障共产主义建设
    苏联普遍建立人民志愿纠察队
    本报莫斯科10日电　据苏联报纸报道：目前，苏联各地绝大多数大工业企业、建筑工地、集体农庄和国营农场中都建立了人民志愿纠察队，它们在组织广大群众维护社会秩序方面已经起了很好的影响。
    苏联各地的人民志愿纠察队是根据今年3月初苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议通过的“关于劳动人民参加保卫国家社会秩序”的决议建立的。苏联内务部部长杜多罗夫最近就四个月来苏联各地根据上述决议建立人民志愿纠察队的情况对“消息报”记者发表了谈话。
    杜多罗夫说，苏联党和政府坚定不移地执行苏共第二十一次代表大会关于把国家机关、其中包括内务部机关的某些职能移交给社会团体的决定。人民志愿纠察队的建立，为把内务部机关的某些职能移交给社会团体这一具有重要政治意义的大事奠定了基础。
    杜多罗夫指出，苏共中央和苏联部长会议“关于劳动人民参加保卫国家社会秩序”的决议是在进一步发展苏维埃民主的道路上的重要里程碑，苏联各地党组织、苏维埃和共青团组织在根据这项决议组织人民志愿纠察队方面已经做了很多工作。在过去四个月中，人民志愿纠察队的组织形式已经基本上形成了。各地工业企业、集体农庄和国营农场的人民纠察队一般是由本单位的职工和庄员单独组成的，但也有些人民志愿纠察队是由几个不大的企业或农庄的职工和庄员联合组成的。全国各地参加人民志愿纠察队的有成千上万在群众中享有威信、受群众尊敬的先进的工人、农庄庄员和知识分子。此外，在城市和各个区中还建立了人民志愿纠察队司令部，司令部由当地党组织、苏维埃或者共青团组织的有经验的领导人领导。
    人民志愿纠察队是劳动人民独立的社会组织，它们不对民警机构负责，而是在当地党委会和苏维埃的监督下进行工作。它们活动的主要方针是：把主要力量放在预防那些教养不良的、觉悟低的公民、特别是青年人中可能发生的违法行为。
  各地人民志愿纠察队常常同共青团组织在车间、田间或宿舍里组织座谈会，讨论苏维埃人的道德面貌和在生活中、生产上、社会上的行为准则问题，人民志愿纠察队正在坚决地消除产生放荡、不守纪律等有害于社会秩序的行为的根源。
    现在，苏联各地人民志愿纠察队已经成为一支强大的社会力量，斯维德洛夫斯克州的上伊塞茨克钢板轧制厂在成立人民志愿纠察队以后，这里的社会秩序比以前显著改善了，因违反社会秩序而被传讯到民警机关的人大大减少了，工厂中旷工和迟到现象也大为减少。乌克兰共和国的斯大林诺、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克和洛干斯克等州的人民志愿纠察队，在州党组织领导下，在矿工青年中广泛进行了教育工作，制止不守纪律和违害社会秩序的行为发生。许多负有刑事责任的坏分子则被交给了同志审判会加以教育。这些坏分子中的绝大多数经过社会的教育已经开始走上了正路。
    由于人民志愿纠察队吸收了广大群众积极参加保护社会秩序的斗争，苏联民警机构现在便有可能集中自己的主要力量来执行自己的主要职责——改造那些严重地不遵守社会主义社会的准则而又不能接受教育的人。
    内务部长杜多罗夫曾指出，自然，把国家的某些职能交给社会团体决不意味着削弱社会主义国家和国家机构在共产主义建设中的作用。社会团体执行目前国家的某些职能只会更加扩大和加强苏维埃社会的政治基础，只会保证社会主义民主的进一步发展。
