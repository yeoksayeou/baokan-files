Xinhua News Agency, Hefei dispatch: More than 8.8 million mu of double-cropping early rice in Anhui Province is about to ripen. Early-maturing varieties such as "Youmangjing" and "503" have already begun to be harvested. As of July 18, the province has harvested 25,000 mu of early rice and rushed to plant 17,000 mu of late rice.

Commercial and handicraft industry units throughout the province are vigorously supporting people's communes in rushing to harvest early rice and rush planting late rice. In the Wuhu area alone, commercial departments in seven counties, including Wuwei, Dangtu, and Shexian, purchased more than 305,500 pieces of agricultural implements such as rice threshers, quick harvesters, rice baskets, raincoats, straw hats, and brooms to supply the countryside. The Anqing area also launched a campaign of "worker, farmer, and merchant coordinated operations, rushing to manufacture, repair, and supply various agricultural implements to welcome the rush harvesting of early rice and rush planting of late rice."

Thanks to the people's communes' proper arrangement of labor and the strong support of the industrial and commercial systems, the province's "double rush" work is progressing rapidly. For example, Jiuhua Commune in Qingyang County harvested more than 700 mu of early rice on July 15, and planted all of it with late rice on the same day, with approximately 200 dan of base fertilizer applied per mu. The Anqing area, after harvesting 22,000 mu of early rice, immediately rushed to plant more than 16,000 mu of late rice.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang dispatch: Jiangxi's rush harvesting of early rice and rush planting of late rice has entered a busy stage. Since the provincewide start of harvesting a week ago, 3.5 million mu of early rice has been harvested and 3.4 million mu of late rice has been rushed planted, with good quality in both.

To ensure that the province's 22 million mu of early rice is brought home and 13 million mu of late rice is transplanted in a timely manner, 5 million laborers in Jiangxi have participated in the rush harvest and rush planting. Communes throughout the province also universally mobilized the masses to discuss and formulate various measures to ensure good harvesting and planting, with most areas stipulating labor quotas and reward systems, and launching "double rush" red flag competitions between teams, groups, and individuals.

Fighting alongside the 5 million laborers are also agricultural implement repair teams, supply teams, and medical teams. Employees in the province's ironware, bamboo ware, and other industries began rushing to manufacture various summer harvest and summer planting tools as early as two months ago. Commercial departments have also strengthened the supply of living materials, with various localities transferring large quantities of water tobacco, wine, sugar, dried bamboo shoots, fermented soybeans, dried salted vegetables, daylily, and other non-staple foods to the countryside, organizing a large number of peddlers to go deep into villages and fields. Nankang County alone has more than 1,400 peddlers going to the countryside. Medical departments have universally organized mobile medical teams (groups) to diligently serve the health of the labor force.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou dispatch: Zhejiang Province is comprehensively starting to harvest early rice from south to north. Wenzhou area, where the season is earlier, has already entered a busy period of rice harvesting. The coastal areas of Wenzhou and Ningbo rushed to harvest more than 1 million mu of early rice in this struggle to defend against typhoons. The Hangjiahu Plain area, where the season is the latest, has also started harvesting due to early transplanting and the selection of some early-maturing varieties. Early rice planted using steam seedling raising methods in counties such as Haining, Tongxiang, and Jiaxing has been harvested on a large scale.

This year, Zhejiang Province's more than 14 million mu of early rice has generally grown very well, with the exception of some coastal areas that have suffered typhoon damage. The per-unit-area yield of early rice that has already been harvested is generally higher than last year. Commune members report that the characteristics of this year's early rice are dense rice heads, thick rice ears, and even growth.

From the beginning of early rice harvesting this year, Zhejiang localities have attached great importance to careful harvesting and threshing. From the provincial party committee to the commune party committee, party secretaries at all levels have gone deep to inspect and participate in careful harvesting and threshing work, and promptly promote good experiences when they are discovered. People's communes in more than a dozen counties in the Wenzhou area have universally formulated operational procedures for careful harvesting and threshing of early rice based on the experience of careful harvesting and threshing of spring-flowering crops, and strictly implement them.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning dispatch: The early rice in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has entered the stage of large-scale harvest. Yulin area, where the season is earlier, has already harvested 60%, and Nanning and Wuzhou areas have harvested 25% to 35%. Guilin and Baise areas, where the season is the latest, have also started harvesting.

This year, Guangxi planted a total of more than 12 million mu of early rice. In May and June, continuous heavy rains in Yulin, Wuzhou, Nanning, Guilin, and other areas caused mountain floods, and more than 1.22 million mu of early rice was hit by floods. After the disaster occurred, party committees at all levels led the people's communes to drain and rescue the crops in a timely manner. Therefore, with the exception of approximately 300,000 mu of early rice that was severely affected and had reduced yields, the general losses were light, and the early rice yield was still higher than last year. For example, Cenxi and Yulin counties were hit by floods three times in succession. Thanks to timely rescue and careful harvesting and threshing, the output per mu of most of the early rice that has been harvested has increased by 10% and more than 20% respectively compared to the same period last year. In non-disaster areas, the harvest is even better, and the good news of large-scale high yields is constantly being reported.

In the rush harvest, all localities have paid great attention to careful harvesting and threshing. Many people's communes have arranged labor and divided them into work groups according to harvesting, threshing, transporting, and drying, and arranged the rice stalks in rows, so that they are harvested as they ripen, gently harvested and placed, and carefully harvested and re-threshed.

Guangzhou dispatch from this newspaper: Farmers in the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong Province are harvesting early rice quickly and carefully during the tense season of flood fighting, drainage, rush harvesting, and rush planting. In previous years, the harvest time for early rice in the delta plains was generally more than 40 days; this year, although the task of rush harvesting was particularly heavy, it took only about 30 days to basically complete the rush harvest of more than 4 million mu of early rice.

The people's communes in the counties of the Pearl River Delta brought into play the power of large numbers of people and unified mobilization. Before the flood came, they mobilized tens of thousands of people to go to the dikes day and night to fight the flood; after the victory in the flood fight, they quickly concentrated 600,000 fresh troops to drain and rush harvest. Many communes organized labor and tool cooperation and support between teams through equivalent exchange methods such as exchanging work and paying work points, to jointly accelerate the progress of drainage and rush harvest. Beixi Commune in Zhongshan County concentrated 77% of the commune's labor force, a total of more than 6,600 people, to rush harvest, and under the unified mobilization of the commune, implemented mutually beneficial cooperation, and quickly rushed to harvest more than 25,000 mu of early-maturing rice. The people's communes in the counties of the Pearl River Delta generally implemented a responsibility management system with quotas assigned to individuals, remuneration calculated according to work, and bonuses for exceeding the quota in labor management, and organized operation groups for harvesting, threshing, transporting, drying, managing, and draining according to the commune members' labor expertise, set up pace-setters, and carried out competitions, and the efficiency of rush harvesting has generally improved. The communes in the five rice field areas of Fanshun County, in order to achieve both fast and careful harvesting, organized more than 50,000 professional teams for quick harvesting, quick threshing, re-threshing, picking up grains, and acceptance, and conducted daily evaluations and acceptances. When rushing to harvest 6,200 mu of waterlogged early rice, they generally ensured that the fields were clean, the docks were clean, the rice stalks were clean, and the drying yards were clean, and it is estimated that they harvested more than 20 jin of grain per mu.

    早稻金黄　收割大忙
    珠江三角洲战胜洪水提前收完早稻
    据新华社合肥讯　安徽省八百八十多万亩双季早稻即将黄熟。成熟期早的“有芒粳”“五零三”等早稻已经开镰收割。到7月18日止，全省已收割早稻二万五千亩，抢插晚稻一万七千亩。
    全省各地商业、手工业等单位都大力支援各地人民公社抢收早稻和抢种晚稻。芜湖专区仅无为、当涂、歙县等七个县的商业部门，就采购了打稻机、快速收割器、稻箩、蓑衣、?笠、扫帚等农具三十万五千五百多件供应农村。安庆专区还开展了一个“工、农、商协同作战，突击赶制、整修、供应各种农具，迎接早稻抢收晚稻抢种”的运动。
    由于各人民公社妥善安排劳力，以及工业商业系统的大力支援，全省的“双抢”工作进展很快。如青阳县九华公社在7月15日收割早稻七百多亩，当天就全部栽上了晚稻，并且每亩上基肥二百担左右。安庆专区在收割了二万二千亩早稻后，随即抢插晚稻一万六千多亩。
    据新华社南昌讯　江西抢收早稻抢插晚稻进入大忙阶段，全省普遍开镰一周以来，已收割早稻三百五十万亩，抢插晚稻三百四十万亩，抢收抢插的质量良好。
    为了保证全省二千二百万亩早稻颗粒还家和一千三百万亩晚稻适时插秧，江西全省已有五百万劳动大军参加抢收抢插。各地公社还普遍发动群众讨论和制订了保证收好种好的各项措施，绝大部分地区规定了劳动定额和奖励制度，开展了队与队、组与组、个人与个人之间的“双抢”红旗竞赛。
    与五百万劳动大军并肩作战的，还有农具修理队伍、供应队伍和医疗队伍。全省铁器、竹器等行业的职工，早在两个月前便开始赶制各种夏收夏种工具。商业部门也加强了生活资料的供应，各地调运大批水烟、酒、食糖、笋干、豆豉、干盐菜、黄花菜等副食品下乡，组织大批货郎担深入村头、田间，仅南康县下乡的货郎担就有一千四百多个。医疗部门普遍组织了巡回医疗队（组），为劳动大军的身体健康辛勤服务。
    据新华社杭州讯　浙江省正由南到北全面开始收割早稻。季节较早的温州地区已经进入割稻大忙。温州、宁波沿海地区在这次防御台风斗争中抢割了一百多万亩早稻。季节最迟的杭嘉湖平原地区，今年由于提早插秧和选用部分早熟品种，目前也已开镰收割。海宁、桐乡、嘉兴等县用蒸汽育秧法栽种的早稻已经大面积收割。
    今年浙江省一千四百多万亩早稻除了沿海部分地区遭受台风灾害以外，普遍生长很好，已经收割的早稻单位面积产量一般都高于去年。社员们反映，今年早稻的特点是稻头密、稻穗粗、生长整齐均匀。
    浙江各地今年一开始收割早稻，就十分重视细收细打。从省委到公社党委，各级党委书记都深入检查和参加细收细打工作，发现好的经验就及时推广。温州地区十多个县的人民公社，根据春花作物细收细打的经验，普遍制订出早稻细收细打的操作规程，严格执行。
    据新华社南宁讯　广西僮族自治区的早稻已经进入大收阶段。季节较早的玉林专区已经割了60％，南宁、梧州专区割了25％到35％。季节最迟的桂林、百色专区也已开镰收割。
    今年广西共计种植早稻一千二百多万亩。5、6月份由于玉林、梧州、南宁、桂林等地区连降几次大雨，山洪暴发，有一百二十二万多亩早稻受到了洪水袭击。灾情发生后，各级党委都领导人民公社及时进行了排水抢救。因此，除三十万亩左右受灾较重的早稻减产外，一般损失较轻，早稻产量仍高于去年。如岑溪、玉林两县，先后遭受三次洪水袭击，由于抢救及时和精收细打，已收完的大部分早稻，每亩产量仍比去年同期分别增产一成和二成以上。在非灾区，年成更好，普遍获得丰收，大面积丰产的喜讯不断传来。
    在抢收中，各地都很注意精收细打。很多人民公社安排了劳动力，按照收、打、运、晒划分了作业小组，进行了稻禾排队，做到熟一块，割一块，轻割轻放，细收复打。
    本报广州电　广东省珠江三角洲的农民在紧张的抗洪、排涝、抢收抢种季节中，早稻收得快收得细。往年，三角洲平原早稻的收获时间，一般要四十多天；今年虽然抢收任务特别繁重，却只用三十天左右时间便把四百多万亩早稻基本抢收完毕。
    珠江三角洲各县的人民公社，发挥了人多势众、统一调动的威力，当洪水来袭前，即抽调数十万人上堤日夜抗洪；抗洪胜利后，又迅速集中了六十万生力军，一边排涝，一边抢收。许多公社在排涝抢收中，以换工、付工分的等价交换办法，组织队与队之间的劳动力和工具协作支援，共同加快排涝抢收进度。中山县北溪公社各大队抢收时集中了占全社劳力77％共六千六百多人，在公社统一调动下，实行互利协作，很快便将二万五千多亩早熟的水稻抢割完。三角洲各县的人民公社在劳动管理上，普遍实行定额到人，按工计酬，超额奖励的责任管理制度，并根据社员的劳动特长，组织收、打、运、晒、管、排涝等作业组，树立标兵，开展竞赛，抢割效率普遍提高。番顺县五个稻田地区的公社，为了做到既快收又细收，组织了快收、快打、翻打、拣谷、验收的专业队五万多人，天天评比验收，在抢收渍水的六千二百亩早稻时，一般做到田净、码头净、禾秆净、晒场净，估计每亩多收了谷子二十多斤。（附图片）
