To grasp teaching quality well, we must grasp both teaching and learning. The General Party Branch of the Biology Department of Nanjing Normal College has done a good job in grasping teachers' conscientious teaching and students' attentive learning.

If we only focus on teachers' conscientiousness and relax students' attentiveness, even if the teaching is excellent, students will still not learn well. The result is the same if we only focus on students' attentiveness. If teachers do not grasp the teaching aspects well, it will not work either. Similarly, if students do not master some of the key steps in studying hard, they will also achieve half the result with twice the effort.

To truly grasp teaching well, the most important thing is to conduct in-depth and detailed investigation and research, and to do a good job in ideological work. In understanding the situation, the General Party Branch of the Biology Department of Nanjing Normal College discovered that teachers and students were not clear about the purpose of teaching and learning, so they seized this issue for discussion. When teachers and students reached a consensus in their thinking, and the purpose of teaching and learning became clear, they further grasped teaching and learning. In this way, a new atmosphere of teaching was formed.

    要抓好
    要抓教学质量，就要抓好教和学两个方面。南京师范学院生物系党总支抓住教师认真教和学生用心学就很好。
    只抓紧教师的认真，放松了学生的用心，即使教得再好，学生还是不能学好。只抓学生用心，结果也是一样。如果教师对教学环节，抓不好也不成。同样，学生不掌握住用功读书的一些环节，也会事倍功半。
    要真正抓好教学，最重要的是进行深入细致的调查研究；并作好思想工作。南京师范学院生物系党总支在了解情况中，发现师生对教和学的目的不明确，就抓住这个问题进行讨论。师生思想认识一致了，教和学的目的明确了，就进一步抓住教和学。这样，就形成了教学的新风气。
