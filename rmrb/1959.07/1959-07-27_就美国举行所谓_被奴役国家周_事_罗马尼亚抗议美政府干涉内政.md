Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 25th: According to reports in local newspapers today: On July 24th, the Romanian government lodged a protest with the US government in a note regarding the US holding the so-called "Captive Nations Week." The note pointed out that this activity is an interference in the internal affairs of Romania and other socialist countries.

Romanian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lazareanu, has already handed over the note to the US Minister to Romania, Wharton.

The note pointed out that the Romanian government believes that this hostile action taken by the United States against Romania, with which it maintains normal diplomatic relations, violates the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, and is an act of "Cold War" and poisoning the international atmosphere.

The note said that at a time when the people of the world are expecting solutions to major outstanding international issues, this action is contrary to the interests of all countries, including the American people. At the same time, this unfriendly attitude is extremely contradictory to the statements repeatedly made by representatives of the US government expressing their willingness to develop friendly relations between Romania and the United States. In the note, the Romanian government expressed its firm protest against the US attempt to interfere in Romania's internal affairs, and demanded that the US government immediately cease such actions.

    就美国举行所谓“被奴役国家周”事
    罗马尼亚抗议美政府干涉内政
    新华社布加勒斯特25日电　据此间报纸今天报道：罗马尼亚政府24日在一份照会中就美国举行所谓“被奴役国家周”向美国政府提出了抗议。照会中指出，这个活动是对罗马尼亚以及其他社会主义国家内政的干涉。
    罗马尼亚外交部副部长拉查雷亚努已经把这份照会交给美国驻罗马尼亚公使华顿。
    照会中指出，罗马尼亚政府认为，美国对同它保持正常外交关系的罗马尼亚采取这一敌对行动，是违反联合国宪章的基本原则的，它是“冷战”和毒化国际气氛的行动。
    照会说，正当世界各国人民期待解决悬而未决的重大国际问题时，这种行动是违反包括美国人民在内的各国人民的利益的。同时，这种不友好的态度是和美国政府代表曾多次发表的愿意发展罗美间友好关系的声明是极其矛盾的。罗马尼亚政府在照会中表示坚决抗议美国干涉罗马尼亚内政的企图，并要求美国政府立即停止这种行动。
