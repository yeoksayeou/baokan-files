    I Want to Protest
    Lao She
    These past few days, I have been watching with indignation the illegal trial by the Athens military court of the Greek national hero Glezos and other patriots.
    When I was young and studying history and geography, I learned about ancient Greece. Greece is the hometown of Socrates and Aristotle, and the birthplace of the Olympic peace games. In human memory, Greece was once a symbol of flourishing civilization. But what is the world coming to? Greece is so benighted, with national scum occupying the temples of Greece and judging the outstanding sons of the Greek people. They treat the law like child's play and democracy like a toy, with hounds chasing after patriots openly appearing in court as the "witnesses" for the prosecution. This is simply a shameful mockery of the glorious name of Greece!
    Glezos and other imprisoned Greek patriots are great warriors for peace and democracy, and outstanding representatives of the Greek people. The Greek authorities' attempt to persecute them is an attempt to stifle the Greek people's beautiful aspirations for independence, peace, and democracy. However, the Greek authorities must be reminded once again that Glezos's name is not only deeply imprinted in the hearts of the Greek people, but also deeply engraved in the hearts of peace-loving and just people all over the world. If the Greek authorities think that they can erase Glezos's name from the hearts of hundreds of millions of people around the world with knives and prisons, then they are sorely mistaken. Now, the Greek people and all upright and kind people around the world are launching a powerful movement to defend Glezos and demand the release of Glezos and other patriots.
    As a Chinese writer, my heart cannot be calm. I want to protest, and loudly lodge a stern protest to the Greek authorities: No persecution of Glezos and other Greek patriots! (Attached picture)
    Who insists on breaking up the family happiness between Glezos and his son?

    我要抗议
    老舍
    这几天，我怀着激愤的心情，注视着雅典军事法庭对希腊民族英雄格列索斯及其他爱国者的非法审讯。
    少年时学史地，即知古希腊。希腊是苏格拉底和亚里斯多德的故乡，是奥林匹克和平竞赛会的发祥地。在人类的记忆里，希腊曾经是文明昌盛的象征。但是，今为何世？希腊竟昏暗若斯，民族败类窃据希腊的神殿，审判希腊人民的优秀的儿子。他们把法律视同儿戏，民主视同玩物，追逐爱国者的猎犬公然出庭充当原告的“证人”。这简直是对希腊这个光荣名字的可耻的嘲弄！
    格列索斯和其他被囚的希腊爱国者，是和平与民主的伟大的战士，是希腊人民杰出的代表。希腊当局企图迫害他们，就是企图扼杀希腊人民的独立、和平与民主的美好的愿望。但是，必须再一次提醒希腊当局，格列索斯的名字不仅深深地印在希腊人民的心底，而且还深深地铭刻在全世界爱好和平与正义的人民的心里。希腊当局如果以为用屠刀和牢房能够从全世界亿万人民的心中抹去格列索斯的名字，那就大错特错了。现在，希腊人民和全世界一切正直善良的人们正在开展强大的运动，保卫格列索斯和要求释放格列索斯及其他爱国者。
    作为中国的一个作家，我的心不能平静。我要抗议，要大声地向希腊当局提出严正的抗议：不许迫害格列索斯和希腊的其他爱国者！（附图片）
    是谁硬要拆散格列索斯父子之间的天伦之乐呢？
