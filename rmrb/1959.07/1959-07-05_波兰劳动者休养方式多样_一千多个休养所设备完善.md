    Diverse Recreation for Polish Workers
    Over a Thousand Well-Equipped Sanatoriums
    (Reported by this newspaper) Every summer, hundreds of thousands of Polish workers enjoy vacations in scenic areas. This year alone, 540,000 people are vacationing at state-run sanatoriums (20,000 more than last year and 50,000 more than the year before). Additionally, nearly 100,000 people are vacationing at trade union-run sanatoriums. Vacationers at sanatoriums only need to pay 120 to 220 zlotys for a two-week vacation, while the government subsidizes the other 90% of the costs. Currently, there are 1,500 sanatoriums in Poland, all equipped with comprehensive facilities such as entertainment, sports equipment, radios, and televisions.
    There are many ways for workers to take vacations, including family vacations or mother-child vacations. This year, nearly 30,000 people are taking vacations in this manner. The number of children on family vacations is free of charge, regardless of the number. There are also travel vacations, where people can take special trains or ships to visit scenic spots across the country in seven days. For people with poorer health, the state provides 21- or 28-day vacations, allowing them to recuperate in sanatoriums. Poland has eighty sanatoriums, forty of which have disease-healing fountains. This year, more than 80,000 people will go to sanatoriums for recuperation. There are also beautiful houses in Warsaw, specifically for people from rural areas to stay during their vacations.

    波兰劳动者休养方式多样
    一千多个休养所设备完善
    本报讯：每到夏季，波兰就有数十万劳动人民在风景优美的地区休假。今年单是在国家办的休养所度假日的就有五十四万人，（这个数字比去年多二万，比前年多五万），同时还有将近十万人在工会办的休养所度假。在休养所的人只需付一百二十到二百二十个兹罗提就可休假两星期，而其它达90％的费用由政府补助。目前全波兰有一千五百个休养所，它们的设备齐全，如文娱、体育用品、收音机、电视机等应有尽有。
    劳动人民休假的方式很多，有全家或母子度假的，今年将近有三万人这样度假。全家度假的小孩人数不管多少都是免费的。也有旅行度假的，他们可以乘上专门火车或船只用七天的时间到全国各个名胜地方游览。身体不大好的人，国家给予二十一天或二十八天的假期，让他们到疗养所去休养。波兰有八十个疗养所，其中四十个有能医疗疾病的喷泉，今年将有八万多人到疗养所去休养。在华沙也有漂亮的房屋，专门供来自农村的人休假住的。（附图片）
