Why is Nanzhang's Wood Ear Production Increasing Year by Year?
    Yang Bai
    Nanzhang County, a key wood ear producing area in Hubei Province, has seen its output increase year by year in recent years, with an average annual increase of about 7% since 1949. As wood ear production rises, the income of the masses also increases. In Changping Commune, in 1957 alone, income from wood ear production averaged more than 52 yuan per household. As a result, the living standards of the masses in the producing areas have improved significantly. In the past, they lacked clothing and food, but now they have ample clothing and food. The masses praise this production as: "Looking at the big mountain slopes from afar, and silver nests up close, wood ears fill the mountains, no worries about food and clothing."
    Why can Nanzhang's wood ear production develop steadily? The fundamental reason lies in the Party committee's emphasis on this production and its strengthened leadership. The reason why the Party committee attaches importance to it is due to the full understanding of the important significance of developing wood ear production for supplying the needs of the urban and mining areas, expanding exports and increasing the income of commune members. What major measures has this county taken to develop wood ear production?
    First, the county party committee and the party committees at all levels above the county have assigned dedicated personnel to lead wood ear production at each level, and have listed wood ear production as an important production project, allocating labor and fixing dedicated personnel to manage specific production. In order to develop wood ear production, the communes here also implement the method of contracting work and production, and rewarding overproduction in wood ear production.
    Second, relying on the masses to develop "ear mountains" in a planned way. Trees that produce wood ears take about ten years to grow. In order to ensure that wood ear production can develop year by year, they not only "rely on the mountains to eat from the mountains" but also actively "eat from the mountains to nourish the mountains," and expand the area of "ear mountains" year by year, to materially ensure the development of wood ear production. There are two methods for cultivating "ear mountains" locally: one is to cut dense mountains, cutting trees in a planned way, not shaving them bald, so as to ensure that there are trees to cut every year; the other is to turn barren mountains into oak mountains (oak trees are also called Quercus variabilis), planting acorns every year. The county has planted more than 150,000 mu in recent years.
    Third, exchange advanced technologies and strengthen "ear stalk" management. The county attaches great importance to improving production technology. In order to promote advanced technology, it has convened on-site meetings several times, summarized and promoted high-yield experiences, and continuously increased the unit area yield of wood ears.
    Some areas believe that there is a contradiction between producing wood ears and raising tussah silkworms. Here, due to the comprehensive planning of wood ear production and tussah silkworm raising according to local conditions, the two productions are advancing simultaneously. Their method is: raise tussah silkworms in near-mountain and low-mountain areas, and grow wood ears in far-mountain and high-mountain areas. Each production is the responsibility of dedicated personnel.
    Due to the measures taken at all levels, their planned output this year will increase by about two times compared to last year.
    Local commercial departments and production units have fully signed wood ear pre-purchase contracts and promptly issued pre-purchase deposits, solving the problem of capital shortage in the development of production in the communes, which has played a certain role in promoting the development of wood ear production here.

    南漳木耳生产为什么能逐年上升
    杨柏?
    湖北省木耳重点产区南漳县，几年来产量逐年上升，从1949年以后产量平均逐年增加7％左右。木耳产量上升，群众收入也随之增多，这里的长坪公社，1957年仅木耳生产一项，平均每户就收入五十二元多。因而产区群众生活水平提高很多，过去缺衣少食，现在丰衣足食。群众歌颂这项生产是：“远看大山坡，近看银子窝，木耳结满山，不愁吃和穿”。
    为什么南漳的木耳生产能稳步发展呢？根本原因在于党委重视这项生产，并加强了对它的领导。而党委之所以重视，是由于充分认识了发展木耳生产对供应城市、工矿区人民的需要，扩大出口和增加社员收入的重要意义。这个县发展木耳生产采取了哪些主要措施呢？
    第一、县委和县以上的各级党委，层层有专人负责领导木耳生产，并将木耳生产列为重要的生产项目，安排了劳力，固定专人管理具体生产。为了发展木耳生产，这里各公社在木耳生产上也实行包工包产、超产奖励的办法。
    第二、依靠群众有计划的发展“耳山”。生产木耳的树，培植十年左右才能长成，为了使木耳生产能逐年发展，他们不仅“靠山吃山”而且还积极地“吃山养山”，逐年扩大“耳山”面积，从物质上保证木耳生产的发展。当地培植“耳山”的方法有二种：一是砍稠山，有计划的砍树，不是剃光头，这样就保证了年年有树可砍；二是变荒山为柞山（柞树即青杠树，也叫橡子树，属壳斗科），年年点橡子，全县几年来共种植了十五万多亩。
    第三、交流先进技术，加强“耳杆”管理。这个县非常重视提高生产技术，为了推广先进技术，先后几次召开了现场会议，总结和推广了高产经验，使木耳的单位面积产量不断提高。
    有的地区，认为生产木耳和放养柞蚕有矛盾，他们这里由于把生产木耳和放养柞蚕因地制宜地作了全面规划，因此使两项生产同时并进。他们的作法是：近山、低山养柞蚕，远山、高山种木耳。不论哪项生产都各有专人负责。
    由于层层采取了措施，今年他们的计划产量将比去年增加二倍左右。
    当地商业部门和生产单位全面签订木耳预购合同，及时发放预购定金，解决公社发展生产中缺资金的问题，对发展这里的木耳生产起了一定的促进作用。
