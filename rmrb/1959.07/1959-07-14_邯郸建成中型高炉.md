Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    A medium-sized blast furnace with a volume of 255 cubic meters has been completed at the Handan Iron and Steel Plant in Hebei and began producing iron on June 30.

    Calculated by volume, this blast furnace can produce 300 tons of iron per day, which is equivalent to about one-quarter of the current daily iron production in the Handan area.

    Handan is one of the iron and steel production bases in Hebei Province. It not only has the Fengfeng Coal Mine, known for producing high-grade coking coal in China, but also has rich iron ore resources, and transportation is also very convenient.

    邯郸建成中型高炉
    据新华社讯　一座二百五十五立方公尺的中型高炉在河北邯郸钢铁厂建成，并在6月30日开始出铁。
    这座高炉按容积计算，每天可产铁三百吨，相当于目前邯郸地区生铁日产量的四分之一左右。
    邯郸是河北省钢铁产地之一。这里不仅有我国以出产高级炼焦煤著称的峰峰煤矿，而且有富铁矿资源，交通运输也很便利。
