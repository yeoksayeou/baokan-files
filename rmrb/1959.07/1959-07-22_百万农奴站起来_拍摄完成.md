Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio has completed filming a documentary, "Million Serfs Stand Up," which exposes the reactionary, dark, cruel, and barbaric serf system of Tibet and reflects the urgent demand of millions of Tibetan serfs for democratic reform.

The film is printed in both Chinese and Tibetan versions. Using a large number of facts and evidence, the film reflects the savage and brutal exploitation and oppression suffered by the working people of Tibet under the serf system. The film exposes a large number of crimes committed by the Langzixia (former Lhasa Municipal Government) in its cruel oppression of the people: in front of the former Lhasa Municipal Government were placed whips, large steelyards, abacuses, and an underground prison in the interrogation room. Working people who could not pay the strange and exorbitant taxes were subjected to beatings and locked in this prison. The film reveals to the audience the "scorpion pit" under the Potala Palace, which was used to harm the working people.

The film introduces how the Tibet Military Region and the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet helped the Tibetan people build highways, power stations, and schools, and the close and inseparable friendship between the PLA officers and soldiers and the Tibetan people. Finally, it records the actual situation of the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which was recently held.
