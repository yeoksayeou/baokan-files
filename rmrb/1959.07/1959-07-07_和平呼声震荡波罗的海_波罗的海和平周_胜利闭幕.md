    Peace Calls Resonate Across the Baltic Sea
    "Baltic Sea Peace Week" Concludes Successfully
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 5th: The 1959 "Baltic Sea Peace Week," which opened on June 27th in Rostock, a seaport city in northern East Germany, concluded this afternoon.
    Karl Mewes, candidate member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and First Secretary of the Rostock District Committee, said at the closing ceremony that this year's "Baltic Sea Peace Week" has become a major international event, fully demonstrating the unity of the people of the Baltic Sea coastal and Nordic countries and their will to turn the Baltic Sea into a sea of peace.
    The number of guests from Nordic countries participating in this year's "Baltic Sea Peace Week" greatly exceeded that of last year. The German Democratic Republic's Tenth Anniversary Exhibition and various cultural and sports activities held in Rostock vividly reflected the peaceful construction and peaceful life of the people of the German Democratic Republic, which aroused great interest among the audience. At the symposiums for workers, women, and university students held during the Peace Week, guests from Nordic countries, like the people of the socialist countries along the Baltic Sea, opposed turning the Baltic Sea into a military springboard for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and supported the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Baltic Sea.
    Representatives of Baltic Sea coastal countries stated at an international peace rally held in Greifswald on the 4th that they resolutely forbid the establishment of atomic and rocket bases in the Baltic Sea region and condemned the behavior of West German revanchists. Participants, in a letter to the people of the Baltic Sea coastal countries that was unanimously adopted, condemned certain groups for implementing policies that were hostile to the cause of peace and for conducting propaganda that was hostile to the cause of peace, attempting to obstruct the convening of a high-level conference. The letter called on all peace-loving forces in the Baltic Sea coastal countries to extensively carry out people's movements to make the Baltic Sea a sea of peace and friendship among all peoples.
    The rally also passed a proposal to convene a conference of representatives of Scandinavian countries advocating peace in the near future to discuss urgent issues related to maintaining peace in the Baltic Sea region. It was decided that the Baltic Sea countries would celebrate September 1st of this year as a day of common effort to strive to turn the Baltic Sea into a peaceful region.
    "Baltic Sea Peace Week" was held in Rostock, a seaport city in northern East Germany, from June 27th to July 5th. More than 50,000 peace-loving people from Baltic Sea coastal countries and other European countries participated in the Peace Week.

    和平呼声震荡波罗的海
    “波罗的海和平周”胜利闭幕
    新华社柏林5日电　6月27日在德意志民主共和国北部海港罗斯托克城开幕的1959年“波罗的海和平周”今天下午闭幕。
    德国统一社会党中央政治局候补委员、罗斯托克专区党委第一书记卡尔·梅维斯在闭幕式上说，今年的“波罗的海和平周”已经成为重大的国际事件，它充分显示了波罗的海沿岸和北欧国家人民的团结和把波罗的海变成和平的海的意志。
    今年参加
  “波罗的海和平周”的来自北欧各国的客人大大超过去年。在罗斯托克举行的德意志民主共和国十周年展览会和各项文艺、体育活动，生动地反映出了德意志民主共和国人民的和平建设与和平生活，这些都引起了观众的极大兴趣。在和平周期间举行的工人、妇女和大学生的座谈会上，北欧各国的客人和波罗的海沿岸的社会主义国家的人民一样，反对把波罗的海变成北大西洋公约组织的军事跳板，赞成在波罗的海实现无原子武器区的主张。
    波罗的海沿岸国家的代表4日在格里夫斯华尔德市举行的国际和平集会上表示坚决不许在波罗的海地区建立原子基地和火箭基地，并且谴责西德复仇主义者的行为。与会者在一致通过的告波罗的海沿岸国家人民书中，谴责某些集团执行仇视和平事业的政策和进行仇视和平事业的宣传，企图阻挠召开高级会议。告人民书呼吁波罗的海沿岸国家的一切爱好和平的力量广泛地开展人民运动，以使波罗的海成为和平与各国人民友好的海。
    集会还通过了关于在最近召开主张和平的斯堪的纳维亚国家的代表会议来讨论有关维护波罗的海地区和平的迫切问题的建议。决定波罗的海各国把今年9月1日这一天作为共同努力争取把波罗的海变为和平地区的日子来庆祝。
    “波罗的海和平周”六月二十七日到七月五日在德意志民主共和国北部海港罗斯托克城举行。参加和平周的有五万多名来自波罗的海沿岸各国和欧洲其他国家的爱好和平的人们。图为参加和平周开幕式的一部分国际和平友人。
