Editor's Note:

    The breeding season for improved sheep is approaching. This work has received increasing attention. First, because it is an effective measure to promote the further development of China's wool textile industry. At present, China does not produce much fine wool and semi-fine wool, and a portion of the wool needed by the wool textile industry still needs to be imported from foreign countries. If we speed up the work based on the experience of improving sheep last year, and strive to improve most of China's coarse wool sheep into fine wool sheep or semi-fine wool sheep in a short period, it may be possible for the wool textile industry to achieve self-sufficiency in raw materials earlier. Secondly, the weight and height of improved sheep are generally higher than those of coarse wool sheep, and the wool production is generally one or two times higher than that of coarse wool sheep. The wool quality is white, fine and soft, and the price is also higher than that of coarse wool. Therefore, seizing the season, actively breeding, and massively propagating improved sheep is an important way for people in pastoral areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas to increase their income.

### 多养改良绵羊

    多养改良绵羊
    改良绵羊配种季节就要到来了。这个工作已经受到人们越来越大的注意。首先因为这是促使我国毛纺织业进一步发展的有效措施。目前我国生产的细羊毛和半细羊毛还不多，毛纺织工业需要的羊毛有一部分还要由外国进口。如果我们在去年改良绵羊的经验基础上加快速度，争取在不长期间把我国大部分粗毛羊改良成为细毛羊或者半细毛羊，就有可能使毛纺织工业提早实现原料自给。其次，经过改良的绵羊体重体高一般都超过了粗毛羊，产毛量一般比粗毛羊高一两倍，毛质洁白细软，价格也比粗羊毛高。所以，抓住季节，积极配种，大量繁殖改良绵羊，又是牧区和半农半牧区群众增加收入的一个重要办法。（附图片）
