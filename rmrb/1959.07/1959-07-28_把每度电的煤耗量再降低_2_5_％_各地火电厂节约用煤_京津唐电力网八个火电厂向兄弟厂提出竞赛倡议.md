Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: A movement to vigorously conserve coal while ensuring safe power generation is gradually unfolding in thermal power plants across the country.

The specific goal of this movement is: to actively respond to the call of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and strive to reduce average coal consumption per kilowatt-hour by another 2.5% in the second half of the year, based on the actual coal consumption rate in the first half of the year.

The Beijing Electric Power Administration proposed an initiative on July 26th to launch a friendly competition with brother power plants across the country. They guarantee that in the second half of the year, the eight thermal power plants in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid will burn 550,000 tons of low-value coal and further reduce power generation coal consumption by 3% compared to the original plan. To accomplish this goal, they have proposed the following measures: conscientiously implement the instructions of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, absorb the advanced experiences of brother plants in saving coal, and implement the requirements of saving coal to every work team and worker; strengthen technical management, improve maintenance quality, eliminate equipment defects, improve operation techniques, strengthen the analysis of various indicators, and improve the thermal efficiency of the unit while ensuring safety; and improve coal yard management and strive to save non-production coal.

The Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant and the Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant, which have already achieved great results in saving coal in the first half of the year, have also put forward targets and measures to further ensure safe power generation and reduce coal consumption. The average coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of the Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant in the first half of the year has already decreased by 29 grams compared to the same period last year, saving more than 7,400 tons of coal compared to the national plan in half a year. Now, they have decided to further launch a mass movement, vigorously promote technological innovation, strengthen technical management and business management, save another 6,000 tons of coal in the second half of the year, and increase the proportion of mixed burning of low-value coal from the original 79% to more than 85%, saving the country 250,000 tons of good coal through the burning of low-value coal. Based on the specific situation of their plant, the Yangshupu Power Plant has also proposed measures to strengthen the analysis of coal so that stokers can promptly grasp the performance of the coal, striving to use 3,500 tons less standard coal than the national plan in the third quarter.

    把每度电的煤耗量再降低2.5％
    各地火电厂节约用煤
    京津唐电力网八个火电厂向兄弟厂提出竞赛倡议
    新华社27日讯　一个在保证安全发电的前提下大力节约用煤的运动，正在全国火力发电厂逐步展开。
    这个运动的具体目标是：积极响应水利电力部的号召，争取下半年在上半年实际煤耗率的基础上，平均每发一度电再降低用煤2.5％。
    北京电业管理局7月26日提出向全国兄弟电厂开展友谊竞赛的倡议。他们保证：下半年京津唐电力网的八个火力发电厂将烧低值煤五十五万吨，并且比原计划再降低3％的发电煤耗。为了完成这个指标，他们提出的措施是：认真贯彻水利电力部的指示，吸取兄弟厂节约煤炭的先进经验，把节约用煤的要求贯彻到每一个班组和工人中去；加强技术管理，提高检修质量，消除设备缺陷，改进运行操作技术，加强对各项指标的分析，在保证安全的前提下，提高机炉热效率；以及改善煤场管理，努力节省非生产用煤等。
    今年上半年在节约用煤方面已经取得很大成绩的天津第一发电厂和上海杨树浦发电厂，也都提出了要进一步保证在安全发电的前提下，降低煤耗的指标和措施。天津第一发电厂上半年平均每发一度电的煤耗已经比去年同期降低了二十九克，半年内比国家计划节约了七千四百多吨煤炭。现在，他们决定进一步大搞群众运动，大搞技术革新，加强技术管理和经营管理，下半年再节约用煤六千吨，把掺烧低值煤的比重从原来的79％提高到85％以上，通过燃烧低值煤，为国家节省好煤二十五万吨。杨树浦发电厂根据本厂具体情况，也已提出要加强对煤炭的分析，使司炉及时掌握燃煤性能等措施，争取在第三季度内比国家计划少用标准煤三千五百吨。
