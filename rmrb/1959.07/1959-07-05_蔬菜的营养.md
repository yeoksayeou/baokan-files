    The Nutrition of Vegetables
    Fu Lianzhang
    Now is the season when summer vegetables are on the market and autumn vegetables are being sown. I think we should advocate growing more vegetables and eating more vegetables, because vegetables are very beneficial to us.
    Vegetables can provide us with a large amount of vitamins. Vitamins are essential substances in the process of human metabolism. A lack of them will cause illness. For example, a lack of Vitamin A will cause a skin disease and night blindness, and a lack of Vitamin C will cause scurvy. There are also other vitamins that are indispensable. Vegetables can provide us with a variety of vitamins. For example, carrots, spinach, and pumpkins contain more Vitamin A precursors, which can be converted into Vitamin A after entering the human body; Vitamin C is more widely distributed in vegetables, fruits, and melons, and peppers, bitter gourds, rape, and cauliflower are all rich in it. Compared with pork, except for pig liver, the content of these two vitamins in pork is almost zero.
    Vegetables are also a major source of essential minerals for our lives. A lack of minerals will also make people sick. For example, calcium is the main component of human bones, and a lack of it will cause poor development of teeth and bones; iron is an indispensable raw material for the production of heme, and a lack of it will cause anemia. Iron and calcium are abundant in vegetables. For example, the calcium and iron content of amaranth exceeds that of pork by more than ten times.
    Root vegetables are rich in starch, and legumes also contain a lot of vegetable protein and vegetable fat, which are all very good nutrients for us.
    Vegetables can help digestion because most of them contain a kind of crude fiber, which can enhance intestinal peristalsis, which is conducive to digestion and bowel movements. In addition, vegetables can also help the digestion and absorption of protein. Experiments have shown that without eating vegetables, the protein in the intestine can only be absorbed by 70%, but eating vegetables can increase it to 80%. I am a person suffering from chronic gastrointestinal diseases. Due to eating spinach and other vegetables all year round, I have gained great benefits.
    Vegetables have various flavors: some are fragrant, some are spicy, some are sour, some are sweet, some are floury, and some are crisp. They are best served as side dishes when matched together. In fact, the taste of meat is relatively simple, so eating meat also requires the help of green onions, garlic, melons and vegetables to season it. Of course, if you only eat one kind of vegetable for a long time or use monotonous cooking methods, it may also be boring, so you should also pay attention to planting a variety of vegetables, eating a variety of vegetables, and diversifying cooking methods. This can not only make the vegetables complement each other in terms of nutrient content, but also make the taste fresh and increase people's appetite. In the past, many people praised the taste of vegetables. For example, Yang Wanli of the Song Dynasty wrote in his poem: "The newly cooked vegetable soup is emerald green and delicate, and there is no such taste in the world's grilled meat." Su Dongpo also advocated a cooking method similar to vegetable soup and rice, called "Dongpo Soup." He also said that vegetables have a "natural sweetness" and "even Liang meat cannot match it."
    Eating more vegetables can also save food. This kind of saving is of particularly positive significance, because in addition to the benefit of saving food, it also enables us to obtain rich nutrition and improve health.
    The above-mentioned points give us sufficient reasons to advocate planting more vegetables and eating more vegetables. Planting vegetables and eating vegetables are unified. Only by planting more can we eat more. If we plant less and eat more, then after a moment of pleasure, even if we want to eat less, there will be nothing left. The People's Daily published an editorial on June 29 entitled "Hurry Up and Arrange Autumn Vegetable Production." We should actively respond to this call.

    蔬菜的营养
    傅连暲
    现在正是夏菜上市，秋菜下种的季节。我想应该提倡多种蔬菜多吃蔬菜，因为菜对我们有很多的好处。
    蔬菜可以供给我们大量的维生素，维生素是人体新陈代谢过程中必不可少的物质，缺少了就要生病。如像缺乏甲种维生素，将患一种皮肤病和夜盲症，缺乏丙种维生素将患一种坏血病。还有其它好些种维生素也都是不能缺少的。而蔬菜就能供给我们多种多样的维生素。例如胡萝卜、菠菜、南瓜等含有较多的甲种维生素原，它进入人体后就能转变成为甲种维生素；而丙种维生素分布在菜蔬瓜果中更为广泛，辣椒、苦瓜、油菜、菜花等含量都很丰富。若与猪肉比较起来，除猪肝而外，猪肉中这两种维生素的含量几乎等于零。
    蔬菜又是我们获得生命必需的矿物质的主要来源。缺少矿物质人也要生病。如像钙是人的骨胳的主要组成成分，缺少它就会使人的牙齿和骨胳发育不良；铁是生成血红素不可少的原料，缺少它就会发生贫血。铁和钙在菜蔬中是丰富的，例如苋菜的钙和铁的含量就超过猪肉十倍以上。
    薯类菜蔬富有淀粉，豆荚类还有不少的植物蛋白和植物脂肪，这都是我们很好的养分。
    蔬菜可以帮助消化，因为它大多含有一种粗纤维，能增强肠子的蠕动，有利于消化又能通大便。此外蔬菜还能帮助蛋白质的消化和吸收，有人实验证明，不吃蔬菜时，蛋白质在肠内只能摄取70％，吃了蔬菜就可以增加到80％。我是一个患有慢性肠胃病的人，由于终年吃菠菜和其它的菜蔬，获得了很大的好处。
    蔬菜有各种各样的味道：有的香、有的辣、有的酸、有的甜、有的粉、有的脆，调配起来，最好佐餐。其实肉食的味道倒比较单一，所以吃肉也得借助于葱蒜瓜菜来调味。当然如果长期的只吃一种菜或采用单调的烹调方法，也可能令人乏味，所以还要注意种多样的菜，吃多样的菜，和烹调方法多样化。这既可以使蔬菜互相补充营养素含量的不足，又使味道新鲜，增加人的食欲。从前也有不少人称赞菜蔬的味道，如宋代杨万里的诗句有：“菜羹新煮翠茸纤，人间脍灸无此味。”苏东坡还提倡一种类似菜汤饭的烹调方法，名之为“东坡羹”，他也说过菜有“自然之甘”“虽梁肉不能及也。”
    多吃蔬菜还能节约粮食，这种节约特别有积极的意义，因为它除了有节省粮食的好处而外，还使我们获得丰富的营养，增进健康。
    上述种种，就使我们有充分的理由来提倡多种蔬菜和多吃蔬菜，种菜与吃菜是统一的，只有多种才能多吃。如果少种而多吃，那么痛快一时之后，即使想少吃也就没有了。人民日报6月29日发表了一篇
  “赶快安排秋菜生产”的社论，我们应该积极地响应这一号召。
