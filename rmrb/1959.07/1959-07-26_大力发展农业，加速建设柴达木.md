Vigorously Develop Agriculture and Accelerate the Construction of Qaidam
Director of the Qaidam Planning Economic Construction Committee, Yang Hao

The rich and lovely Qaidam, under the correct leadership of the Party, has transformed from a sparsely populated Gobi desert into a familiar, beloved, and longed-for place after several years of exploration and construction. This vast area possesses unique and abundant resources, a large amount of arable land and natural pastures, truly deserving the name "Treasure Basin" and "Granary." To date, 116 geological structures with potential oil reserves have been identified. Drilling on 40 of these structures has led to the discovery of ten oil fields and three gas fields with industrial exploitation value. The "Lenghu No. 5" structure has been confirmed as a high-quality, large-volume, and ideal oil field.

Geological surveys and oil exploration proceeded in tandem, resulting in the discovery and identification of over 50 types of minerals and more than 220 mineral deposits. These deposits generally have exploitation value. Qaidam possesses almost all the mineral types in mineral deposit classification and all the elements listed in the periodic table. Qaidam will be a vast industrial base with broad development prospects for the motherland. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, production of oil, lead-zinc ore, potash fertilizer, and other materials urgently needed by the state has been carried out following the principle of "using indigenous methods and making use of existing conditions." More than 750 factories and mines of various types have been established one after another. This not only enables Qaidam's treasures to serve the socialist construction of the motherland in advance but also reverses the past phenomenon of "only importing and not exporting," creating a situation of "both importing and exporting, with more exports than imports."

Of particular importance is the 6.66 million mu of arable land, 48 rivers of varying sizes, 16 lakes with a total flow of 7 billion cubic meters for irrigation, and abundant natural peat fertilizer, making it suitable for large-scale agricultural development. After several years of reclamation, 21 state-owned farms have been established, with a sown area of 430,000 mu. In addition, Qaidam has more than 95 million mu of pastureland, capable of grazing more than 5 million head of livestock. Currently, various types of livestock have reached more than 1.6 million head. Therefore, Qaidam has broad development prospects not only in industrial development but also in agricultural and animal husbandry development, and it will become a complete economic system in itself.

Although Qaidam's mineral resources are so abundant, large-scale development and construction in the past required a massive influx of population from other areas because there was no social foundation. The prerequisite for increasing the population was to solve the food problem. It is not feasible to rely solely on supplies from other areas if the local area does not produce grain. Under the correct leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers in Qaidam resolutely implemented the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. In particular, since the all-round Great Leap Forward in 1958, the contradiction of agricultural production not keeping up with the needs of industrial development has become more prominent. Therefore, developing agricultural production and striving to increase grain production have become important tasks for the entire region.

To develop agricultural production in the Qaidam area, it is necessary to walk on two legs, strengthening intensive cultivation to greatly increase the yield per unit area while actively reclaiming wasteland and expanding the cultivated area. Because increasing the yield per unit area can only be gradual and requires many conditions to be guaranteed. Before mechanization is achieved, a large amount of manpower is needed to carry out large-scale water conservancy, fertilizer application, intensive cultivation, and large-scale land processing. At the same time, increasing the yield per unit area requires land in the first place. And Qaidam is mostly uninhabited areas and virgin land that has never been cultivated, so it is necessary to simultaneously increase the yield per unit area and actively reclaim wasteland. Due to adherence to this policy, the sown area has increased year by year, and the yield per unit area has also increased year by year. This year, 430,000 mu have been sown, an increase of nearly five times compared to 1954. In 1958, the grain yield per unit area was 482 jin, more than double that of 1954. In 1959, due to the greater emphasis on agricultural production by Party committees at all levels and the greatly increased enthusiasm of the masses, more than 9 billion jin of fertilizer were accumulated, with an average of 20,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu. More than 70,000 mu of land were deep-plowed, and canals were renovated and expanded. The sowing period was generally 15 days earlier than last year, and 20% of the cultivated land has basically achieved garden-like management. The current field management is very meticulous, and a mass movement to strive for large-scale high yields has been launched, so crops are growing well and a bumper harvest is in sight.

Developing agriculture in Qaidam is not without difficulties. In addition to the lack of labor, it is a high-altitude cold region with a short frost-free period and the soil has a high salt-alkali content. Therefore, it is necessary to wage a tenacious struggle against nature. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers have understood the far-reaching significance of developing agricultural production in the basin and the interrelationship between industrial and agricultural development. This has increased their belief in overcoming difficulties and that man can conquer nature. Through the arduous efforts and continuous experiments of the workers, the basic laws of developing agricultural production in the basin have been preliminarily explored. For light and heavy saline-alkali land, a series of measures such as irrigation and soaking, autumn deep plowing, winter irrigation, spring application of organic fertilizer, scraping salt and digging alkali, and using crop physiological characteristics to improve saline-alkali land have been adopted respectively. This has greatly reduced the harm of salt-alkali to crops, improved the soil, and significantly increased the yield per unit area, while laying the foundation for further development of agricultural production.

In order to solve the needs of the basin's employees and promote greater development of agricultural production, it is also necessary to pay attention to diversified operations. Qaidam's farms have planted vegetables, established pig farms, livestock farms, and small factories and mines for processing non-staple foods.

In order to fully utilize Qaidam's agricultural resources, rapidly develop agricultural production, and promote the development of various construction undertakings, mainly the petroleum industry, it is planned to reclaim 2.73 million mu of wasteland and achieve a sown area of 2 million mu within a few years, including 1.6 million mu of grain crops. With the great development of agricultural production, livestock production will also increase several times compared to the present. The realization of this plan will greatly change the face of Qaidam. The development prospects of Qaidam's industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production will forever encourage people to work hard and move from victory to new victories.

    大力发展农业，加速建设柴达木
    柴达木计划经济建设委员会主任  杨浩
    富饶可爱的柴达木，在党的正确领导下，经过几年来的勘察和建设，已经由人烟稀少的戈壁滩，一变而为人们熟悉、热爱和向往的地方。在这辽阔的地区内，有着得天独厚的丰富资源，大量的可耕地和天然牧场，不愧被叫做“聚宝盆”和“粮米仓”。截至目前，已经找到可能储油的构造一百一十六个。经过在四十个构造上钻探，找到了十个具有工业开采价值的油田和三个气田，其中“冷湖五号”构造已经肯定是一个质高、量大、合乎理想的油田。
    地质普查与石油勘探并进，先后发现和找到了五十多种矿藏，二百二十多个矿点。这些矿点一般都有开采价值。柴达木几乎拥有矿床分类学上所有的矿种和元素周期表上所列举的各种元素。柴达木将是祖国有着广阔发展前途的工业基地。几年来，特别是1958年对国家急需的石油、铅锌矿、钾肥等，本着“土法上马，因陋就简”的原则进行生产，先后建立了各种厂矿七百五十多个，不仅使柴达木的宝藏提前为祖国社会主义建设服务，并且扭转了过去“有进无出”的现象，出现了“有进有出，出多入少”的局面。
    值得重视的是还有可耕地六百六十六万亩，有大小河流四十八条，可资灌溉的湖泊十六个，总流量七十亿公方，并且有充足的天然泥炭肥料，适宜大量发展农业。经过几年来的开垦，先后建立了二十一个国营农场，播种面积已经达到四十三万亩。另外，柴达木还有可供放牧的草原九千五百多万亩，可以牧放五百多万头牲畜。目前各种牲畜已经达到一百六十多万头。所以，柴达木不仅在工业发展上，而且在农牧业的发展上都有着广阔的发展前途，它将自成一个完整的经济体系。
    柴达木的矿产资源虽然这样丰富，但是过去因为没有社会基础，要进行大规模的开发建设，就必须从外地大量移入人口，而增加人口的先决条件是解决粮食问题。如果本地不产粮食，只依靠外地供应是不行的。柴达木的广大职工群众，在党的正确领导下，坚决贯彻了工农业并举的方针，特别是1958年全面大跃进以来，农业生产赶不上工业发展需要的矛盾更显得突出，因此把发展农业生产，努力增产粮食，作为全区的重要任务。
    在柴达木地区发展农业生产，必须用两条腿走路，既要加强深耕细作，大力提高单位面积产量，又要积极开荒造田，扩大耕地面积。因为提高单位面积产量只能是逐步的，并且需要许多条件作保证。在没有实现机械化以前，要大搞水利、增施肥料、精耕细作以及进行大规模的土地加工等工作，需要大量的人力。同时提高单位面积产量，首先要有土地。而柴达木又绝大部分是荒无人烟的地区和未曾开垦的处女地，所以必须提高单位面积产量与积极开垦荒地并举。由于坚持了这个方针，播种面积逐年增加，单位产量也逐年提高。今年播种四十三万亩，比1954年增加将近五倍，1958年粮食单位面积产量四百八十二斤，比1954年提高一倍多。1959年由于各级党委更加重视了农业生产，群众干劲大为高涨，共积肥九十多亿斤，平均每亩施底肥两万斤，深翻土地七万多亩，并整修和扩修了水渠，播种期一般比去年提早了十五天，有20％耕地基本实现了园田化。目前的田间管理做得很细致，已经掀起了一个力争大面积丰产的群众运动，因而庄稼生长良好，丰收在望。
    在柴达木发展农业不是没有困难的，除了劳力缺乏以外，这里是高寒地区、无霜期短、土质含盐碱较大，因此必须同大自然作顽强的斗争。几年来广大职工群众在党的领导下，都懂得了在盆地发展农业生产的深远意义和工业农业发展的相互关系，因而提高了他们战胜困难、人定胜天的信念。经过职工们的艰苦奋斗和不断试验，初步摸索到了在盆地发展农业生产的基本规律。对于轻、重不同的盐碱地，都分别采用了灌溉泡洗、秋季深翻、冬季灌水、春季多施有机肥料、刮盐挖碱以及利用作物生理特性改良盐碱地等一系列措施，大大减少了盐碱对农作物的为害，改良土壤，显著地提高了单位面积产量，同时为进一步发展农业生产奠定了基础。
    为了解决盆地职工生活需要，促进农业生产的更大发展，还必须注意多种经营。柴达木各农场都种植了蔬菜，建立了养猪场、畜牧场以及副食品加工等小型厂矿。
    为了充分地利用柴达木的农业资源，迅速地发展农业生产，促进以石油工业为主的各项建设事业的发展，计划在几年之内开荒造田二百七十三万亩，播种面积达到二百万亩，其中粮食作物一百六十万亩。随着农业生产的大发展，畜牧业生产也将比目前增加几倍。这个计划的实现，将大大地改变柴达木的面貌。柴达木工农牧业生产的发展远景，将永远鼓舞着人们艰苦奋斗，从胜利走向新的胜利。
