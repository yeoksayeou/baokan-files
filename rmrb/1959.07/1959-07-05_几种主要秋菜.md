Several Major Autumn Vegetables
　Lü Yang

　　Generally speaking, "autumn vegetables" in northern regions refer to some vegetables that are sown in July and August and harvested in October and November. Although the growing period of autumn vegetables is only three months, most of them are used to supply the market needs during the off-season of winter and spring vegetable production. Therefore, the success or failure of autumn vegetable production in the north is related to whether people have vegetables to eat for half a year. There are many types of autumn vegetables, mainly including Chinese cabbage, white radish, mustard greens, turnips, and carrots. Now I will introduce several autumn vegetables with large planting area and high yield:

　　Chinese cabbage is mainly distributed in northern regions (cultivation has also expanded to the south in recent years). In the long-term production, the working people of our country have not only accumulated rich experience in Chinese cabbage cultivation, but also selected and bred many excellent varieties: such as "Da Qingkou" and "Qing Bai Kou" in Beijing, "Qing Ma Ye" and "Da Hetao Wen" in Tianjin, "Hetou Cai" in Tangshan, "Hetao Wen" in Xushui, and "Da Ye Cai" in Jiaoxian, etc.

　　Chinese cabbage is resistant to storage and transportation, and the unit yield is also relatively high. The planting area of Chinese cabbage in the north accounts for about 60% of the autumn vegetable area. Chinese cabbage is generally sown around "Autumn Begins" and matures between October and November. Chinese cabbage can be stored in cellars after harvest until March and April of the following year without spoiling.

　　Cultivating Chinese cabbage requires careful management. Sufficient water and fertilizer, and timely prevention and control of pests and diseases are necessary to ensure firm heads and good quality. The general yield of Chinese cabbage is about 10,000 jin per mu. In recent years, due to the adoption of reasonable close planting and strengthening field management, the unit yield has been continuously improved.

　　White radish is the most widely distributed in China and has many varieties. It is also one of the important vegetables supplied in the north during the winter and spring seasons. Some varieties of white radish are suitable for raw consumption and can replace fruits in winter and spring. Some are excellent varieties for making pickled pickles.

　　Generally, white radish does not have strict requirements for natural conditions and cultivation techniques, and there are fewer pests and diseases than Chinese cabbage. As long as the soil is loose and sufficient water and necessary fertilizer are supplied in time during the growing period, a bumper harvest can be obtained.

　　Carrot is a high-yield and nutritious vegetable. According to analysis, every jin of carrots contains 11-18 milligrams of vitamin A (carotene), which is 2.6 to 5 times more than that of apples. Carrots can be eaten raw, cooked, pickled, or mixed into porridge and rice. Carrots and their leaves are also good feed. Some people call it "feed ginseng".

　　Carrots are highly adaptable and can be planted in the south and north. They prefer loose sandy loam soil. Carrots do not require a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer. If there is too much nitrogen fertilizer, it will cause the tubers to become loose and not resistant to storage. Applying more plant ash is beneficial to improving the yield and quality of carrots.

　　Mustard Greens and Turnips: The roots and leaves of mustard greens have a strong spicy taste, and are suitable for making special pickles, such as Zidatou Cai in Yunnan and Xiangdatou Cai in Zhejiang. Turnips have no spicy taste. In addition to pickling or cooking, they can also be mixed with rice to replace part of the grain. Turnip leaves can be dried or used as feed.

　　Both mustard greens and turnips can be cultivated in relatively barren soil. Land where Chinese cabbage cannot grow well can be used to sow these two vegetables. In some areas, people are accustomed to planting them on the edges of fields, which is a practice that is worth promoting because it can not only make full use of land fertility but also expand the source of vegetables.

    几种主要秋菜
    吕扬
    一般所说的“秋菜”，在北方地区指的是7、8月间播种，10、11月间收获的部分蔬菜。秋菜生长时期虽然只有三个多月，但是绝大部分是供应冬春蔬菜生产淡季时的市场需要，所以北方秋菜生产的好坏，关系到人们半年有没有菜吃。秋菜的种类很多，主要有大白菜、大萝卜、芥菜、蔓菁、胡萝卜等。现介绍几种栽种面积大、产量高的秋菜：
    大白菜主要分布在北方各地（近年来南方也扩大了栽培）。我国劳动人民在长期生产中，不仅积累了丰富的白菜栽培经验，同时选育了很多优良品种：如北京的“大青口”、“青白口”，天津的“青麻叶”“大核桃纹”，唐山的“河头菜”，徐水的“核桃纹”，胶县的
  “大叶菜”等。
    大白菜耐贮运，单位产量也较高，在北方栽培面积占秋菜面积的60％左右。大白菜一般“立秋”前后播种，到10、11月间成熟。大白菜收获后入窖贮藏，可到第二年3、4月而不坏。
    栽培大白菜需要细致管理。水、肥充足，及时防治病虫害，才能结球坚实、品质良好。大白菜一般亩产万斤左右，近年来由于采用了合理密植，加强了田间管理，单位产量不断提高。
    大萝卜在我国分布最广，品种很多，也是北方冬春两季供应的重要蔬菜之一。大萝卜的一些品种适宜生食，冬、春可代替水果。有些是很好的腌制酱菜的品种。
    大萝卜一般对自然条件、栽培技术的要求不太严格，病虫害比大白菜也少，只要土质疏松，在生长期及时供给足够的水分和必要的肥料，就可以获得丰收。
    胡萝卜是一种产量高、营养丰富的蔬菜。据分析，每斤胡萝卜中有维生素甲（胡萝卜素）十一——十八毫克，比苹果的含量还多二点六倍——五倍。胡萝卜可以生食、熟食、腌制，也可以掺入粥、饭中食用。胡萝卜和它的叶子又都是很好的饲料，有人称它为“饲料人参”。
    胡萝卜适应性强，在南方、北方都能种植，性喜疏松的砂壤土。胡萝卜不需要大量的氮肥，如果氮肥过多，会引起块根质地疏松，不耐贮藏。多施些草木灰，对提高胡萝卜的产量、质量都有好处。
    芥菜、蔓菁：芥菜的根、叶有浓厚的辣味，适宜制做特产的小菜如云南的紫大头菜、浙江的香大头菜等。蔓菁无辣味，除腌渍或熟食外，还可以掺和饭内代替一部分粮食。蔓菁的叶子可以晒干菜，也可以做饲料。
    芥菜和蔓菁都可以在比较瘠薄的土壤里栽培，大白菜不能很好生长的土地，就可以播种这两种菜。有些地区的群众习惯利用地头田边种植它们，这种既能充分发挥地力又可扩大菜源的作法，值得提倡。
