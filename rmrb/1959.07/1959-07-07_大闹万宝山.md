　　Southern Jiangxi, 75% of the area is mountainous. High mountains and deep valleys, peaks and ridges undulate, with lush forests, tall bamboo, exotic flowers and herbs everywhere you look.

　　In 1957, the central government instructed all localities to vigorously develop mountainous areas and accelerate the development of diverse economies in mountainous areas. Based on this instruction, the Gan Nan region put forward the slogan of "grasping both thousand-catty mu and Wanbao Mountain." Subsequently, various localities prepared to march towards Wanbao Mountain. However, what treasures were on Wanbao Mountain and what use those treasures had was still a mystery at that time. In order to unravel this mystery, the commercial departments immediately organized more than a thousand cadres to climb the mountains in search of treasure; they collected specimens while investigating resources. Within a month, they traveled to more than 1,500 mountain peaks and discovered and identified more than 2,000 species of wild plant resources in the region alone. These wild plants can be used for oil extraction, winemaking, sugar production, the manufacture of rayon, and various high-grade fragrances; if fully developed and utilized, the annual output value can reach more than 100 million yuan. Among them, mountain pepper, *xiang ling*, *ji po*, wild lacquer, *wu yao*, *liangshan zi*, tung seeds, etc., which can be used as oil materials, can be collected 500,000 dan annually in the region, extracting 10 million jin of oil, with a total output value of 3.5 million yuan.

　　When the secret of Wanbao Mountain was revealed, the people in the mountainous areas were extremely surprised, spreading the news and expressing their desire to climb the mountain to obtain treasure. Since then, the Wanbao Mountain, which had been sleeping for thousands of years, began to be awakened.

　　Since the end of 1957, the people in the mountainous areas of southern Jiangxi have successively climbed more than a thousand mountain peaks, setting up camps. Some collected wild plants, some produced mountain goods and local products, some established processing plants and workshops, each showing their talents, making a big scene at Wanbao Mountain. People describe the scene of their development of mountainous areas as: Climbing mountains to get Wanbao, traveling through thousands of mountains, sleeping in the jungle, getting tens of thousands of dan of treasure.

　　In the battle to make a big scene at Wanbao Mountain, the commercial departments actively extracted funds and some equipment to help the people in the mountainous areas, and the battle to obtain treasure quickly swept across the mountain villages of southern Jiangxi. Dingnan County, which is full of towering mountains, is full of mountain pepper seeds, but it lacks oil extraction equipment. The commercial bureau of this county quickly helped the people in the mountainous areas build more than a dozen small mountain pepper seed oil extraction factories. At the beginning, each 100 jin of mountain pepper seeds could only extract three and a half jin of oil, and the staff of the commercial department, together with the people in the mountainous areas, made a big scene of technological innovation, resulting in an increase to 10 jin of oil per 100 jin. Mountain pepper seed oil is fragrant and is the main raw material for manufacturing violet alcohol and beverages. In Chongyi County, there are lush forests and tall bamboo everywhere. These thick and straight *mao* bamboo forests are good materials for industrial construction; however, in the past, because the mountains were high and the roads were far away, cliffs and steep slopes, and the roads were rugged, they could not be transported down. People sighed and said: "Even if there are ten thousand bamboos in the mountains, they can only let them grow green mountains." In May of last year, the Chongyi County Commercial Bureau united with the people in the mountainous areas to form a team of more than 5,000 people to go up the mountain to cut and transport *mao* bamboo. At first, each person could only cut and transport 16 bamboos per day on average. Later, everyone came up with ideas together, using the terrain of high mountains and steep slopes, and using bamboo to build ditches, and a large number of *mao* bamboo slid down the mountain along the ditches, and the efficiency increased by more than 200 times. Since then, bamboo-framed ditches have become popular here. Now people sing: It is not difficult to transport bamboo on high mountains, bamboo-framed ditches transport it down the mountain, from then on, shoulder carrying is liberated, and the people in the mountainous areas smile.

　　Since 1958, the commercial departments of southern Jiangxi have allocated 3 million yuan to help the people in the mountainous areas establish more than 20,000 processing plants and workshops; and sent hundreds of technicians and cadres deep into the mountainous areas, circulating to teach various production and processing technologies such as picking, peeling, and processing, thereby helping the people in the mountainous areas to overcome the difficulties of insufficient funds and lack of technical knowledge. The commercial departments of many counties have adopted methods such as running training classes, holding on-site meetings, and technical lectures, and have trained more than 10,000 technicians in a few months. With the development of production, the commercial departments carried out large-scale sales and purchases. For large quantities of products, they collect in batches, collectively, and rush to collect; for scattered products, they go door-to-door to collect, extend purchasing and sales points everywhere, and collect at night markets. In this way, it greatly facilitates the people in the mountainous areas to sell their products. They sing: The commercial department is really concerned, the store is opened in the high mountain village, the mountainous area has a purchasing and sales store, buying and selling is convenient without turning over the mountains.

　　The result of making a big scene at Wanbao Mountain is that it has prospered the mountain economy and found the "God of Wealth" for the people in the mountainous areas. Many wild plants, mountain goods and local products used to grow, wither, and rot on the mountains, self-generating and self-destructing; now they have become the precious wealth of the people in the mountainous areas. Chongyi County is very rich in wild plant fiber resources, which have never been used in the past. At the end of last year, the commercial department helped to establish a factory for producing rayon here. Since then, plant fibers all over the mountains and fields have been used. This county alone produced more than 32,000 jin of snow-white rayon in the first half of this year.

　　"No grain needed, fragrance of fine wine everywhere," is a portrayal of the people in Longnan County, a remote mountainous area, using wild plants to make wine. In the past, people here called "Wanbao Mountain" "Poor Light Mountain," and the rich treasures were not developed and utilized. Last year, people proposed: To ask Wanbao Mountain for grain and wine, and only then did they begin to use the resources of the mountainous area. So far, this county has used various wild plants to brew more than 30 kinds of fine wines, with an output of more than 60,000 jin. In addition, it has also used wild starch to process 253 kinds of 150,000 jin of pastries, saving the country more than 90,000 jin of grain.

　　This is such a tempting number: From last year to now, the mountain goods and local products produced by the people in the mountainous areas of southern Jiangxi and the wild plants used total 521 kinds, an increase of 300 kinds compared with 1957, with an output of 104.26 million jin, an increase of 6.5 times compared with 1957; the total income reached 8.87 million yuan, and the average income per person in the mountainous area was nearly 100 yuan, more than twice that of 1957.

　　In the mountainous areas of southern Jiangxi, people now often say: "In the old society, good fields became grass, and in the new society, there are treasures all over the mountains."

    大闹万宝山
    本报记者　梅宝国　刘光辉
    赣南，有75％的地带是山区。高山深谷，峰峦起伏，山中茂林修竹，奇花异草，触目皆是。
    1957年，中央指示各地大力开发山区，加速山区的多种经济的发展。赣南地区根据这个指示提出了既抓千斤亩，又抓万宝山的口号。接着，各地纷纷准备向万宝山进军。然而万宝山上到底有什么宝，什么宝有什么用，当时却还是一个谜。为了揭开这个谜，商业部门立即组织了一千多名干部登山探宝；他们一边采集标本，一边调查资源。他们在一个月之内跑遍了一千五百多个山头，发现和查明了全区仅野生植物资源就有二千多种。这些野生植物可以用来榨油、酿酒、制糖、制造人造棉和各种高级香料；如果全面加以开发利用，年产值可达一亿元以上。其中可做油料的山苍、响铃、鸡婆、野漆、乌药、凉山籽、梧桐子等，全区每年可采集五十万担，榨油一千万斤，总产值达三百五十万元。
    当万宝山的秘密被揭开之后，山区人民惊喜异常，奔走相告，表示要登山取宝。从此，沉睡千年的万宝山开始被唤醒了。
    1957年底以来，赣南山区人民先后登上一千多个山头，安营扎寨。有的采集野生植物，有的生产山货土产，有的建立加工厂和作坊，各显神通，大闹万宝山，人们形容自己开发山区的情景是：登山取万宝，走遍万重山，露宿丛林里，取宝万万担。
    在大闹万宝山的战斗中，商业部门积极抽出资金和部分设备帮助山区人民，取宝的战斗迅速席卷赣南各山村。到处是崇山峻岭的定南县，山苍籽遍山皆是，可就缺少榨油设备。这个县的商业局迅速地帮助山区人民建起了十多座小型山苍籽榨油厂。开始每百斤山苍籽只能榨出三斤半油，商业部门职工又同山区人民一齐大闹技术革新，结果提高到每百斤出油十斤。山苍籽油芳香扑鼻，是制造紫罗兰醇和饮料的主要原料。在崇义县，到处是茂林修竹，这些粗壮笔直的茅竹林，是工业建设的好材料；可是，过去因为山高路远、悬崖陡壁、道路崎岖，运不下来。人们感叹地说：“山间纵有万根竹，只能让它长青山。”去年5月间，崇义县商业局联合山区人民组成了一支五千多人的队伍，上山砍运茅竹。起初平均每人每日只能砍运十六根，后来大家共同出主意想办法，利用山高坡陡的地势，用毛竹架成沟道，大批茅竹沿着沟道滑下山来，效率提高了二百多倍。从此，竹架沟道就在这里风行开了。如今人们唱道：高山运竹不为难，竹架沟道运下山，从此肩挑得解放，山区人民笑开颜。
    自1958年以来，赣南商业部门拨出了三百万元资金，帮助山区人民建立了二万多个加工厂和作坊；并派出了数百名技术人员和干部深入山区，巡回传授采摘、剥制、加工等各种生产加工技术，从而帮助山区人民克服了资金不足、不懂技术的困难。许多县的商业部门采取办训练班、开现场会、技术讲座等方法，几个月内就培养了一万多名技术人员。随着生产的发展，商业部门开展了大销大购活动。对大宗的产品，成批收，集体收，突击收，对零星产品，上门串户收，下伸购销点遍地开花，夜市收。这样，大大方便了山区人民出售产品。他们歌唱道：商业部门真关心，商店开在高山村，山区有了购销店，买卖方便不翻岭。
    大闹万宝山的结果，繁荣了山区经济，给山区人民找到了“财神爷”。许多野生植物、山货土产，过去在山上生长、枯萎、腐烂，自生自灭；现在已变成了山区人民的宝贵财富。崇义县野生植物纤维资源十分丰富，过去从没有被利用过，去年年底商业部门帮助这里建立了一个生产人造棉的工厂，从此，满山遍野的植物纤维就被利用起来了。这个县仅今年上半年就生产了三万二千多斤雪白的人造棉。
    “不用一粒粮、处处美酒香”，是对边远山区龙南县人民利用野生植物酿酒的写照。这里的人们过去把“万宝山”叫做“穷光山”，富饶的宝藏没有被开发利用。去年人们提出：向万宝山要粮要酒，才开始把山区的资源利用起来。至今这个县已经利用各种野生植物酿造了三十多种美酒，产量达六万多斤。另外，还利用野生淀粉加工成了二百五十三种、十五万斤糕点，为国家节约了九万多斤粮食。
    这是一个多么诱人的数字：从去年到现在，赣南山区人民生产的山货土产和利用的野生植物共有五百二十一种，比1957年增加了三百种，产量达一亿零四百二十六万斤，比1957年增加了六点五倍；总收入达八百八十七万元，山区平均每人收入近一百元，比1957年多了两倍多。
    在赣南山区里，人们现在经常这样说：“旧社会良田变成草，新社会满山遍野都是宝。”
