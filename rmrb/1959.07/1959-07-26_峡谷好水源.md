    Good Water Source in the Canyon
    Shigong
    China has many high mountains and deep valleys, and the unparalleled Three Gorges are in our country.
    High mountains and deep valleys are contradictory yet unified, and they always exist together. Because the terrain in high mountain areas is steep and the water flow is rapid, the water erosion of the riverbed is also severe, which can gradually destroy deep canyons in the high mountains. Our ancestors realized this change very early. In the Book of Songs, we can find the sentence "High banks become valleys," which conforms to scientific principles.
    However, the formation of canyons is not only the result of river water action; canyons are the product of river erosion combined with crustal uplift. When the river is eroding, if the crust there rises, the riverbed, which should have become lower due to erosion, can be compensated and maintain a considerable height, so it continues to be severely eroded by the river water. As this continues to develop, particularly deep and narrow canyons are created.郦道元's description of the Three Gorges prominently expresses this deep and narrow characteristic of the canyons. He wrote: "Within the seven hundred miles of the Three Gorges, the mountains on both sides are connected, with hardly any gaps. Layer upon layer of cliffs and peaks obscure the sky and block out the sun. Unless it is noon or midnight, the sun and moon cannot be seen." (Shui Jing Zhu: Jiang Shui). In the canyon, the sun cannot be seen until noon, and the moon cannot be seen until midnight. How deep, narrow, and steep this must be!
    If the crust had not risen, then the riverbed would have become lower due to continuous erosion, and the water level of the river would have also decreased. The height of the river water level directly affects the magnitude of its downward erosion force. When the river water level is higher than sea level, the water flows faster and the erosion force is greater. If the water level decreases, the downward erosion force will also weaken, and very deep canyons cannot be formed. At the same time, the river water continues to erode both banks, gradually widening the river valley, and even creating plains on the riverbanks, making it even more impossible for canyons to appear.
    Therefore, canyons mostly appear in areas that have risen or are rising in the Earth's recent historical period. In particular, there are many such rising areas in western China, which have created many famous canyons such as the Three Gorges and the Sanmenxia Gorge. The characteristics of the section of the Yellow River near Sanmenxia clearly illustrate the influence of crustal uplift. Between Shanxian County and Yuanqu County, the Yellow River channel suddenly narrows, because this section is connected to the Zhongtiao Mountains and the Taihang Mountains, which is a rising area.
    The increase in elevation and the narrowing of the river channel can both accelerate water flow. Therefore, canyons are good places to build hydroelectric power stations. China has many high mountains, many canyons, and abundant rainfall in many areas, so water resources are extremely rich. China's water resources reach about 544 million kilowatts, exceeding the total water resources of the United Kingdom and the United States, and accounting for one-seventh of the world's water resources. About 80% of these 500 million kilowatts of power are stored in the western region with its many high mountains and canyons. Now, canyons are no longer just places to marvel at their险绝. We are "erecting stone walls on the West River and cutting off the clouds and rain of Wushan," so that canyons can also serve our industrial and agricultural production.

    峡谷好水源
    石工
    我国多高山，也多深谷，举世无双的三峡就在我国。
    高山与深谷是对立而又统一的，它们总是伴生在一起。因为高山区地势陡、水流急，水对河底的冲刷也就厉害，能够逐渐在高山中破坏出深深的峡谷。我们的祖先很早就看出了这种变化，在诗经中可以找到“高岸为谷”这样合乎科学原理的句子。
    但是峡谷的形成不仅是河水工作的结果，峡谷是河流的破坏与地壳上升相结合的产物。当河流正在冲刷的时候，如果那里的地壳上升，本来应该因冲刷而变低的河底便能得到补偿，仍然维持相当的高度，于是继续被河水狠狠冲刷，这样不断发展下去，就造成了特别深和特别窄的峡谷。郦道元对三峡的描写突出地表现了峡谷这种既深且窄的特点，他写道：“自三峡七百里中，两岸连山，略无阙处，重岩叠嶂，隐天蔽日，自非停午夜分，不见曦月。”（水经注：江水）在峡谷中不到中午看不见太阳，不到半夜看不见月亮，这该有多深、多窄和多陡！
    假使地壳没有上升，那么河底就要因被不断冲刷而变低，河流的水面也要随着下降。河流水面的高低直接影响着它向下冲刷力量的大小，当河流水面愈是比海面高时，水流愈快，冲刷力也愈大，如果水面降低了，向下冲刷的力量也就减弱，不能造成很深的峡谷。同时河水仍继续对两岸进行破坏，逐渐加宽河谷，甚至在河滨造成平原，因而更不可能出现峡谷了。
    因此，峡谷多出现在地球最近历史时期曾经上升或正在上升的地带，特别是我国西部有许多这样的上升地带，在这些地带造成了三峡、三门峡等许多著名的峡谷。三门峡附近那一段黄河的特点，清楚地说明了地壳上升的影响，在陕县和垣曲之间，黄河河槽突然变窄，因为这一地段和中条山、太行山连在一起，是一个正在上升的地段。
    地势的升高和河槽变窄，都能使得水流加速，因而峡谷是建设水电站的好地方。我国高山多、峡谷多，加上许多地区雨水充足，所以水力资源极为丰富。我国水力资源达到五亿四千四百万瓩左右，超过英美水力资源的总和，占全世界水力资源的七分之一。这五亿多瓩的动力，约有80％蕴藏在多高山多峡谷的西部。如今，峡谷已不只是让人惊叹其险绝而已，我们正在“更立西江石壁，截断巫山云雨”，使峡谷也为我们的工农业生产服务。
