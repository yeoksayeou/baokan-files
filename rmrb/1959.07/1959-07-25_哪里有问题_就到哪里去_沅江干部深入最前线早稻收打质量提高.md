Go Wherever There Are Problems
    Yuanjiang Cadres Go Deep into the Forefront, Early Rice Harvesting Quality Improves
    Changsha Dispatch: (From Our Newspaper) In the intense battle to rush-harvest early rice and rush-transplant late rice, in order to improve threshing quality and reduce grain loss, more than 4,800 cadres from people's communes in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, have gone deep to the threshing drum, participating in production and leading production. Not only is early rice harvested quickly, but it is also harvested carefully. The county average for each threshing team (four people) is now threshing 1,800 to 2,000 jin of grain per day, an increase of 300 to 500 jin compared to last year, generally exceeding quotas.
    Cadres going deep to the threshing drum to participate in and lead production is an important measure taken by the Nandashan Commune to harvest early rice well. This commune began harvesting early rice on the 12th. In the first few days, the average person could only thresh 250 jin of grain a day, not keeping up with the speed of cutting the rice, and much of the harvested rice could not be threshed in time. Moreover, careful harvesting and threshing were not done well. A lot of grain was lost during the processes of threshing, unloading, and transporting, averaging about 30 to 50 jin lost per mu. The reasons for this phenomenon were: some commune members did not pay enough attention to careful harvesting and threshing; some had a poor labor organization, with strong labor for cutting but weak labor for threshing; and many women and students were not skilled, which also affected harvesting quality. At that time, cadres generally gave more general calls for action regarding the rush harvest work, but less in-depth problem-solving, especially failing to go to weak links. After discovering this problem, the commune Party committee studied it and believed that cadres must go deep into the most crucial places to participate in and lead production. Based on the harvesting situation at that time and the existing problems, it was decided that from commune cadres to work team leaders, all those leading the rush harvest should go deep to the threshing drum, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner.
    After the cadres went deep to the threshing drum, they were both commanders and combatants. They repeatedly publicized the "three guarantees and one reward" and distribution according to labor policies to the masses, and rationally allocated labor, so that each threshing team had both experienced and new workers. The experienced workers taught skills and improved operating methods. At the same time, model workers were identified in a timely manner, red flags were planted, experiences were summarized, and competitions were launched. After improving leadership methods, threshing efficiency and quality were greatly improved. On the 15th, the average efficiency of the commune's 2,855 threshing teams reached 2,200 jin, with an average of 520 jin per person, while also achieving careful harvesting and threshing, with very little grain loss.
    After discovering the leadership experience of this commune, Qi Baotong, Secretary of the Yuanjiang County Party Committee, immediately summarized it and proposed throughout the county that cadres should go deep to the forefront, and go wherever there are problems. After the commune cadres and work team leaders went deep to the forefront, they inspired the enthusiasm of the masses, closely contacted the masses, and solved specific problems in a timely manner. Wang Shangwen, Secretary of the General Party Branch of the Nanli Brigade of the Chishan Commune, discovered that one threshing team had two teenagers in it, out of four people total. The labor allocation was unreasonable, the efficiency was very low, and the quality was not high. On average, each person threshed only 350 jin of grain per day. Wang Shangwen suggested that they transfer the teenagers to do other things and replace them with two adults to thresh. The average efficiency per person per day then increased to 650 jin. Wang Shangwen also discovered that the threshing team of Zhang Yongfa and others had achieved "three completes" (complete people, complete heart, complete tools), paid attention to ideology, and cooperated well. On average, each person threshed 680 jin of grain per day. He immediately promoted their good experience throughout the brigade and further launched "four checks" (check tools, check rice straw, check efficiency and quality, check operating techniques). The masses wrote a quick-rhythm ballad praising him: "The all-round Secretary Wang, is the best at hard work and going deep, leading production during the day, giving ingenious plans at night, both efficiency and quality are improved, everyone learns from Secretary Wang."
    In order to harvest early rice well, the county has recently held more than 170 on-site meetings and held 189 physical exhibitions, and the quality of harvesting has been significantly improved. (Li Jinting, Wang Dazhi)

    哪里有问题　就到哪里去
    沅江干部深入最前线早稻收打质量提高
    本报长沙25日电　在紧张抢收早稻、抢插晚稻的战斗中，为了提高打谷质量，减少掉谷现象，湖南省沅江县各地人民公社四千八百多名干部深入到扮禾桶边，参加生产，领导生产，早稻不仅收得快，而且收得精细。全县平均每张扮桶
  （四个人）每天扮谷一千八百至二千斤，比去年增加三百至五百斤，一般都超过了定额。
    干部深入到扮禾桶边参加生产、领导生产，是南大膳公社收好早稻的一项重要措施。这个公社12日开始收割早稻。头几天，平均一人一天只能扮二百五十斤谷，赶不上割禾的速度，许多稻谷割了下来不能及时收打。而且细收细打做得很不好，扮禾、出桶、运谷几道工序中都掉了不少谷，平均一亩田掉三十斤到五十斤左右。产生这种现象的原因是：有的社员对细收细打重视不够；有的则是劳力组织得不够好，割禾的劳力强，扮禾的劳力弱；而且妇女、学生很多技术不熟练，他们也影响收打质量。而当时干部对抢收工作一般号召多，深入解决问题少，特别是没有到薄弱环节的地方去。公社党委发现这个问题以后，进行了研究，认为干部必须深入到最关键的地方去参加生产，领导生产。根据当时收打情况和存在的问题，决定从公社干部到作业组长，凡是领导抢收的都要深入到扮禾桶边去，发现问题，及时解决问题。
    干部深入到扮禾桶边以后，既是指挥员，又是战斗员，他们向群众反复宣传了“三包一奖”、按劳分配等政策，对劳动力进行了合理搭配，使每张扮桶有老手又有新手，老手传授技术，改进操作方法。同时还及时发现标兵，插红旗，总结经验，开展竞赛。改进领导方法以后，扮禾工效、质量就大大提高了。15日，全公社二千八百五十五张扮禾桶，平均工效达到二千二百斤，平均每人达到五百二十斤，同时还做到了细收细打，很少掉谷。
    中共沅江县委书记齐保通发现这个公社的领导经验以后，随即作了总结，在全县提出干部深入最前线，哪里有问题就到哪里去。公社干部和作业组长深入到最前线以后，鼓舞了群众的干劲，密切地联系了群众，及时解决了具体问题。赤山公社南里大队党总支书记王尚文发现有个扮禾桶四个人中就有二个十多岁的少年，劳力搭配得不合理，工效很低，质量也不高，平均每人每天只扮三百五十斤谷。王尚文便建议他们调少年去做别的事，换了两个成年人扮禾，平均每人每天工效便提高到六百五十斤。王尚文又发现张永发等人的扮禾桶因为作到了“三齐”（人齐、心齐、工具齐），思想上重视，协作又搞得好，平均每人每天扮禾六百八十斤谷，当即在全大队推广了他们的好经验，并且进一步开展了“四查”（查工具、查稻草、查工效质量、查操作技术）。群众写了一首快板表扬他：“文武双全王书记，艰苦深入数第一，白天生产带头干，晚上领导出妙计，工效质量都提高，大家都学王书记。”
    为了收好早稻，最近全县开过一百七十多次现场会，举办实物展览一百八十九次，收打质量显著提高。　（李进挺、王达智）
