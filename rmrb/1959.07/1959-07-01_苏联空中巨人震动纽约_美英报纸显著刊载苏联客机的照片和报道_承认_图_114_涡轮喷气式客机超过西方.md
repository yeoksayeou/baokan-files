Xinhua News Agency, 30th - According to TASS: The Soviet Union's largest "Tu-114" giant turboprop airliner, carrying First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Kozlov, and his party, arrived in New York on the 28th after a non-stop flight. This record-breaking flight caused a great sensation in the West. All New York newspapers and many London newspapers prominently published photos or reports about it, unanimously recognizing that it surpasses the West's most modern airliners.

    "The New York Times," under the headline "Soviet Official Delegation Arrives Here on the World's Largest Airplane," published photos of the "Tu-114" plane taxiing on the runway upon landing, and of its designer, Tupolev, along with special reports and feature articles. The article specifically pointed out that the Soviet guests arrived in New York from Moscow in a record-breaking non-stop flight. The silver Soviet aircraft, with the hammer and sickle flag painted on its wings, landed at New York International Airport eleven hours and six minutes after takeoff. The average speed of the flight was 460 miles per hour (740 kilometers), and the distance from the Soviet capital was 5,092 miles (8,191 kilometers). The newspaper's reporter wrote in a feature article that the "Tu-114" airplane, in terms of its size and carrying capacity, surpasses the largest American "Boeing 707" airplane, and also greatly exceeds Western turboprop aircraft such as the British "Bristol Britannia" and the American "Lockheed Electra."

    Britain's "News Chronicle" wrote: "Russian Air Giant Shakes New York." The "Daily Express" wrote that the Russians have leaped to the Americas, and for the first time in aviation history, the Soviet Union has manufactured an airplane capable of flying such a long distance between Moscow and New York. The newspaper also pointed out that the West does not currently have such an airliner.

    美英报纸显著刊载苏联客机的照片和报道
    承认“图—114”涡轮喷气式客机超过西方
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联的世界上最大的“图—114”巨型涡轮喷气式客机，28日载着苏联部长会议第一副主席科兹洛夫等一行以不着陆飞行到达纽约。这一纪录飞行在西方引起了很大轰动。纽约的所有报纸和伦敦的许多报纸都以显著地位刊载了有关它的照片或报道文章，一致认为它超过西方的最新式客机。
      “纽约时报”以“苏联官方代表乘着世界上最大的飞机到达这里”为标题，刊登了“图—114”飞机着陆时在跑道上滑行和它的设计者图波列夫的照片，并发表了专门的报道和特写文章。文章中特别指出，苏联客人以不着陆的纪录飞行从莫斯科到达纽约。机翼上绘有镰刀和锤子旗帜的银色苏联飞机是在起飞后十一小时六分在纽约国际机场着陆的。飞行的平均速度每小时四百六十英里（七百四十公里），这里距苏联首都有五千零九十二英里（八千一百九十一公里）。这家报纸的记者在特写中写道，“图—114”飞机就其规模和载重量说，超过美国最大的“波因—707”飞机，并且也大大超过西方的涡轮喷气机—英国的“布利斯托尔—不列颠”和美国的“洛克哈特—伊莱克特拉”。
    英国的“新闻纪事报”写道：“俄国空中巨人震动了纽约”。“每日快报”写道，俄国人一跃而跳到了美洲，在航空史上苏联第一次制造了能飞行于莫斯科与纽约之间的那样遥远的距离的飞机。这家报纸还指出，这种客机目前西方还没有。
