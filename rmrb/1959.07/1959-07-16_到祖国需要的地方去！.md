Go Where the Motherland Needs You!
By Our Staff Commentator

This summer, more than 60,000 college graduates in our country will successively take up their posts to serve the construction of the great socialist motherland. Over the past few years, under the cultivation of the Party and the state and the guidance of teachers, and through their own hard work, they have been able to master a certain amount of scientific and cultural knowledge, and at the same time have a certain political consciousness. Especially after the education of the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, and encouraged by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in the motherland, many graduating students have issued loud declarations: "Resolutely obey the motherland's allocation, not afraid of any difficulties, go to the place where the motherland needs us most, go to the most difficult areas and border areas!" This revolutionary spirit and noble quality of young people is commendable.

Now, the State Planning Commission has, in conjunction with relevant departments, formulated a distribution plan for this year's college graduates based on the needs of all parties. This plan is formulated based on the principles of focusing on key deployments, strengthening weak links, and taking care of general needs. Graduating students should warmly support the distribution principles of the Party and the government, obey the state's allocation, and go where the motherland needs them!

Of course, in the situation of rapid development of various socialist construction undertakings in the motherland, it is possible that some incompatible phenomena may occur in the distribution according to needs. For example, learning and application may not be completely consistent, and individual wishes or interests may not be fully realized, and so on. This requires a correct understanding of these issues and a correct attitude towards the assigned work.

When our country began to allocate college graduates in the early days of its founding, it proposed the rational allocation and use of college graduates, and implemented the principle of "consistent learning and application" on the basis of national needs. Judging from the work of allocating college graduates in the past few years, the work of the vast majority of graduates is in line with the principle of consistent learning and application, but there are also individual places where a small number of graduates are used improperly. This shortcoming is constantly being overcome and improved. However, it must be pointed out that the implementation of "consistent learning and application" is a relatively complex issue, and things should not be taken simply, regardless of the actual situation and needs of the country, and the requirement of "consistent learning and application" should be isolated. Generally speaking, the state's plan for training specialized talents is consistent with the state's construction plan, but it is impossible to be very accurate and not even a bit off. This is because our country is large, the construction tasks are heavy, and the national construction plan is also revised in its implementation. Therefore, it is very difficult to make the plan for training specialized talents very accurate. Colleges and universities train specialized talents, and it will take several years to assign work. Therefore, in terms of the number of graduates and their majors, they often cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the country's construction undertakings. These contradictions have occurred in the past and will still be difficult to avoid in the future. Therefore, when the state allocates college graduates, it may only be basically "consistent learning and application", or only similar to the nature of the major studied; this situation is understandable.

Our country cares for and loves young people in every possible way. Because young people are the successors to the cause of building socialism and communism, first of all, young people must be educated politically and ideologically to clearly recognize that the construction undertaking is glorious, arduous and difficult, and must be able to withstand the test of difficulties. At the same time, appropriate consideration is also given to some of the actual difficulties of some graduates. Over the years, the state has given appropriate consideration to the actual personal difficulties of a small number of graduates, such as family difficulties and physical weakness. This fully proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist motherland's education system. In countries with capitalist systems, there is only the result of "graduation is unemployment", how can there be any consideration for difficulties?

At present, there is a certain distance between the socialist construction of the motherland and the actual distribution of graduates. Generally, there are more graduates in large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, while there are fewer graduates in remote areas, and some places even have no college graduates. Therefore, it is necessary to transfer some graduates from areas with more graduates to areas with fewer graduates. However, these areas are exactly where the country needs talents. This requires graduates to first obey the needs of the country, overcome various difficulties, and happily accept the state's allocation, go to the place where the motherland needs them most, and go to the remote areas! In order to build a beautiful motherland, young people should become heroic and active loyal soldiers in the cause of building socialism. Young people must use their wisdom and hands, work hard, turn deserts into fertile fields, and build the motherland's beautiful mountains and rivers even more beautiful and happier!

It is also possible that individual graduates one-sidedly emphasize their personal ideals and interests, and demand to go to scientific research departments, large hospitals, large factories, large construction sites, or to be teaching assistants or graduate students in colleges and universities, and so on. Of course, these places and these positions also need specialized talents to work. However, judging from the current needs of various industries in the country, basic construction units, general hospitals, general factories and mines, and middle school teachers need a large number of specialized talents even more. Therefore, graduates with certain conditions must truly "do whatever the country needs me to do." If graduates can work hard, diligently study, and work honestly, they can play an active role in any job position, and "every profession produces an expert"! Extraordinary comes from ordinary. Ordinary positions often create extraordinary deeds, and often train outstanding talents. As long as we serve the people wholeheartedly and make arduous efforts, we will definitely be able to make brilliant contributions to the socialist motherland. It should be recognized that interests and hobbies can be cultivated in the work we do. The most important thing is: "The needs of the motherland are our aspirations"!

Graduates of this year! I wish you to establish a strong revolutionary spirit of not fearing any difficulties, happily obey the allocation of the motherland, and resolutely go to the place where the motherland needs you!

    到祖国需要的地方去！
    本报评论员
    今年暑期我国将有六万多名高等学校毕业生陆续走上工作岗位，为建设伟大的社会主义祖国服务。几年来，他们在党和国家的培养及教师们的教导下，经过自己的努力学习，已经能够掌握一定的科学文化知识，同时具有了一定的政治觉悟。尤其是经过整风运动、反右派斗争的教育，和祖国工、农业生产大跃进的鼓舞，许多应届毕业生纷纷发出响亮的豪语：“坚决服从祖国分配，不怕任何艰难困苦，到祖国最需要的地方去，到最艰苦的地区和边疆地区去！”青年人的这种革命事业心和高贵的品质，是值得赞扬的。
    现在，国家计划委员会已经会同有关部门，根据各方面的需要，对今年高等学校毕业生制定了分配计划。这个计划是采取重点配备、加强薄弱环节和照顾一般的原则拟制的。应届毕业生应当热烈拥护党和政府的分配原则，服从国家的分配，到祖国需要的地方去！
    当然，在祖国社会主义建设各项事业迅速发展的形势下，有可能在根据需要进行分配中，发生某些不相适应的现象。如学与用不可能完全一致，个人的志愿或兴趣不可能完全实现，等等。这就需要对这些问题抱有正确的认识，对被分配的工作抱有正确的态度。
    我们国家在建国初期开始分配高等学校毕业生工作时，就提出了合理的分配和使用高等学校毕业生，并在国家需要的基础上贯彻“学用一致”的原则。从过去几年来分配高等学校毕业生的工作情况来看，绝大多数的毕业生的工作是符合学用一致原则的，但也有个别地方对少数毕业生使用不当，这一缺点正在不断地克服和改进。但是，必须指出，贯彻“学用一致”是个比较复杂的问题，不能把事情看得简单，不顾国家实际情况和需要，而孤立地要求“学用一致”。一般说来，国家培养专门人材的计划是和国家建设计划相一致的，但也不可能十分准确，一分不差。这是因为我们国家大，建设任务繁重，国家建设计划在实施中也有修改。所以，要在培养专门人材方面的计划订得十分准确是非常不容易的。高等学校培养专门人材，要几年以后才分配工作，因而在毕业生的人数和所学专业方面往往赶不上国家建设事业发展的需要。这些矛盾过去曾经发生过，将来也还是很难避免的。因此，国家在分配高等学校毕业生的时候，也有可能只是基本上“学用一致”，或者只是与所学专业性质相近；这一情况是可以理解的。
    我们的国家，对青年人是关怀和爱护备至的。因为青年人是建设社会主义和共产主义事业的接班人，所以首先从政治思想上教育青年人明确认识建设事业是光荣、繁重而又艰巨的，必须经得起困难的考验。同时，也对某些毕业生的一些实际困难给以适当的照顾。历年来，国家对少数毕业生的家庭困难、身体病弱等个人实际困难，都作了适当的照顾。这就充分证明了社会主义祖国的教育制度的无比优越性。在资本主义制度的国家里，只有“毕业即失业”的结果，哪有什么照顾困难呢？
    目前，祖国社会主义建设与毕业生的实际分布有一定的距离，一般是北京、上海、武汉、广州等大城市毕业生较多，而边远地区毕业生较少，甚至有些地方没有高等学校毕业生，因而不得不从毕业生较多的地区调剂一部分毕业生到毕业生较少的地区去。而这些地区却正是国家建设需要人材的地方。这就要求毕业生首先服从国家需要，克服种种困难，愉快地接受国家分配，到祖国最需要的地方去，到边远的地方去！为了建设美丽的祖国，青年人应该成为建设社会主义事业中英勇积极的忠实战士。青年们要用自己的智慧和双手，辛勤地劳动，变沙漠为良田，把祖国的锦绣山河建设得更加美丽、更加幸福！
    也可能有个别的毕业生片面地强调个人的理想和兴趣，要求到科学研究部门、大医院、大工厂、大工地，或是当高等学校助教、研究生，等等。当然，这些地方、这些岗位上也都需要专门人材去工作。但是，从现在国家各行各业发展的需要情况来看，基本建设施工单位、一般医院、一般工厂矿山，以及中学教师，更需要大量的专门人材。所以，具备一定条件的毕业生，就要真正作到“国家需要我做什么就做什么”。如果毕业生都能够努力刻苦钻研，老老实实地工作，那就能够在任何工作岗位发挥积极作用，“行行出状元”！非凡出自平凡。平凡的岗位，往往会创造出非凡的事迹，也往往会锻炼出优秀的人材。只要全心全意为人民服务，通过自己的艰苦努力，就一定能够为社会主义祖国作出光辉的贡献。应当认识到，兴趣与爱好是能够在从事的工作中培养出来的。首要的是：“祖国的需要，就是我们的志愿”！
    本届毕业生们！预祝你们树立起坚强的不怕任何艰难困苦的革命事业心，愉快地服从祖国分配，坚决到祖国需要的地方去！
