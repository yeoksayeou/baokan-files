    Actively Develop the Aquatic Industry
    Lüda Strengthens Artificial Cultivation
    Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, July 18th: Lüda City is actively developing the aquatic cultivation industry to strive for a greater increase in aquatic products.
    Lüda is the largest marine product production base in Northeast China, producing no less than a hundred kinds of fish, shrimp, shellfish, and algae. In the past, aquatic production here was purely based on fishing. In the past two years, in order to meet the growing needs of people for aquatic products, the municipal aquatic products department has mobilized the masses to strengthen artificial cultivation work. For example, kelp, which has always relied solely on natural propagation, began to be artificially cultivated along the coast last winter. In the first half of this year, more than 70,000 tons of fresh kelp were harvested, exceeding the total output of last year by more than 150%. Artificial cultivation of laver has also been successfully tested this year. The Lüda City Aquatic Product Cultivation Farm harvested more than 4,800 catties of laver cultivated on one mu of water surface. Now, the aquatic product cultivation farm is carefully cultivating laver seedlings, and this winter will cultivate laver on 70 mu of sea surface. Aquatic product research departments are also conducting artificial cultivation experiments on mussels (i.e., sea red), sea cucumbers, clams, oysters, etc., striving to quickly realize artificial cultivation of shellfish.
    Lüda City's undertaking of stocking fish fry in natural harbors, salt pan water circles, harbor circles, and ditches is also developing day by day. Now the city has stocked a large number of grey mullet, green shrimp, bighead carp, and perch fry in 75,000 mu of harbors. Many organs, troops, schools, and people's communes are expanding and repairing harbor circles in order to fully utilize all harbors that can develop aquatic production.

    积极发展水产事业
    旅大加强人工养殖
    新华社旅大18日电　旅大市积极发展水产养殖事业，争取水产品有更大的增加。
    旅大是东北地区最大的海产品生产基地，出产的鱼虾、贝类和藻类不下百余种，过去，这里的水产生产只是单纯的捕捞，近两年来，为了满足人们对水产品日益增长的需要，市水产部门发动群众，加强人工养殖工作。像历来只靠天然繁殖的海带，去冬已经在沿海开始人工养殖，今年上半年收获鲜海带七万多吨，超过了去年总产量一倍半多。人工养殖紫菜今年也已试验成功，旅大市水产养殖场在一亩大的水面上养殖的紫菜，收获了四千八百多斤。现在，水产养殖场正在细心地育紫菜苗，今冬将在七十亩海面上养殖紫菜。水产研究部门还在作淡菜（即海红）、海参，蚬子、蛎子等人工养殖试验，争取贝类能很快实现人工养殖。
    旅大市利用天然港湾、盐滩水圈、港圈和沟渠放养鱼苗的事业也日益发展，现在全市已经在七万五千亩港湾里放养了大量鮻鱼、青虾、胖头鱼、魲鱼等鱼苗。许多机关、部队、学校和人民公社都在扩建和修复港圈，以便把可以发展水产生产的港湾，都充分利用起来。
