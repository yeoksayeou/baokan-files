    A Letter of Thanks
    I cannot express my gratitude enough. I think that although this may be a small matter in the new society, I still want to write to tell you about it.
    The matter is this: almost a year ago, the switch on my bicycle light was broken, and I couldn't find a replacement in Jingzhou and Shashi. At that time, I remembered that the People's Daily had once published an article about Comrade Zang Huaijian of the bicycle parts group at the Tianqiao Department Store in Beijing, who enthusiastically repaired bicycles for customers late at night. Therefore, I thought I might as well give it a try. Recently, I wrote a letter to Comrade Zang, enclosing four jiao in postage stamps, asking him to find a knob for me. To my surprise, I recently received a small package from Beijing, with postage alone costing five jiao five fen. Inside were not only two knob switches, but also a simple and touching letter. …
    What moves me is not only that his help made my beloved bicycle shine again; more importantly, it is his excellent quality of "helping others" that has educated me. I must learn from him.

    一封感谢信
    我无法表达我的谢意，我想，这在新社会里虽然也许是桩小事，但还是写信告诉你们。
    事情是这样的：将近一年前，我的自行车灯上的开关被拧坏，我在荆沙无法配到。这时，我想起去年人民日报曾登载过北京天桥商场自行车零件组臧怀俭同志深夜热心代客修理车子的事迹，因此，我想不妨试试，最近，我写信给臧同志，内附四角邮票，请他给我设法配一个旋钮。最近出我意料，收到北京寄来的一件小邮包，仅邮资就五角五分。里面不仅有两个旋钮开关，还有一封朴实动人的信。……
    使我感动的，不仅是由于他的帮助，使我心爱的自行车重见光明；更重要的，是他这种“帮助人”的优良品质，使我受了教育，我一定要向他学习。         湖北读者　陶利林
