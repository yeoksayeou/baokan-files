According to a report in the Jiangxi Daily: The Gaokeng and Wangjiayuan coal mines, subordinate to the Pingxiang Mining Bureau, have contrasting conditions, one being favorable and the other unfavorable. However, due to differing attitudes toward difficulties, varying degrees of mass mobilization, and dissimilar leadership styles and working methods, the Wangjiayuan mine, with its poorer conditions, has achieved high output and high work efficiency, while the Gaokeng mine, with its better conditions, lags far behind.

The production comparison of these two mines up to May shows: Daily output per coal miner: Wangjiayuan Coal Mine 3.877 work tons; Gaokeng Mine 3.57 work tons. Average monthly output per working face: Wangjiayuan Mine 9,857 tons; Gaokeng Mine 6,941 tons. In June, Gaokeng Mine not only had lower production efficiency than Wangjiayuan Mine in all aspects, but also had a total absolute coal output 3,595 tons less than Wangjiayuan Mine.

Gaokeng Mine has more than a thousand more workers than Wangjiayuan Mine. The main tools and equipment, such as coal carts and chutes, are also more numerous in Gaokeng Mine. The degree of mechanization of horizontal roadway transport is 97.68% in Gaokeng Mine and 94.6% in Wangjiayuan Mine. The geological conditions of the two mines are the same coalfield, mining the same coal seam. Coal mining uses both electric drills for blasting and loading coal, and pneumatic picks for coal extraction. Moreover, the production conditions of the working faces in Gaokeng Mine are superior to those in Wangjiayuan Mine.

So, what are the reasons for Wangjiayuan's better production and Gaokeng's lagging production? The main reason is that in the organization of the production upsurge, the leadership of Wangjiayuan Mine established the leadership ideology of believing in and relying on the masses, earnestly implemented the working method of the mass line, and cadres and masses worked together with one heart and with full vigor in all tasks. At the beginning of this year, Wangjiayuan Mine failed to complete its tasks for two consecutive months due to intermittent supply of pit props and Phoebe nanmu, with a total underproduction of more than 8,600 tons by the beginning of March. Faced with such difficulties, the mine's Party General Branch actively examined the reasons subjectively and mobilized the masses to find solutions. According to the instructions of the Mining Bureau Party Committee, they used various propaganda tools to explain the situation, tasks, favorable conditions, advanced experiences, specific measures, new people, and new events to the masses, and mobilized the masses to actively find ways to overcome difficulties. Through mass discussions and research, everyone identified the reasons for the failure to complete the tasks in the previous stage and proposed eight measures, including strengthening pit prop recycling, reuse, and substitution, dual pneumatic pick operation, cross-operation of upper and lower sections, accelerating cycle progress, blasting coal loading, and organizing electromechanical repair teams. This fully exploited the potential of the equipment and overcame the difficulties of short working faces and insufficient equipment, enabling the production level to rise day by day. In mid-March, it increased by 5%, and in the last ten days of the month, it increased by 32.6% compared to mid-March, making up for the shortfall of the previous two months and ensuring the completion of the first quarter's production plan and various economic indicators. Since the beginning of this year, Gaokeng Mine has not completed its production tasks in any month. The leadership often emphasized objective difficulties, believing that production could not be improved without changing the conditions. Although they also held many cadre meetings and took some measures, these measures were not thoroughly discussed after mobilizing the masses, and as a result, they were either divorced from reality or could not be implemented.

In order to ensure the implementation of various production measures in each period, under the unified leadership of the Party General Branch Committee, Wangjiayuan Mine divided the overall work into six fronts: production safety, electromechanical transportation, material supply, living welfare, and propaganda and mobilization. Each of the three major mining areas was assigned one or two leading cadres to specifically assist in carrying out the work. They established a leadership cadre duty system, with leading cadres following shifts underground, discovering and solving problems in a timely manner. There were also dedicated personnel responsible for workers' living welfare. Sometimes, when the cooks were too busy, leading cadres personally delivered steamed buns and tea to the workers. All of this stimulated the workers' production enthusiasm and powerfully promoted the high-yield, high-quality, large-area bumper harvest red flag emulation campaign. Although Gaokeng Mine also did a lot of work in this area, it was insufficient compared to Wangjiayuan Mine. Regarding problems such as poor task completion, confused mass thinking, lax labor discipline, and low labor efficiency, the mine leadership also put in some effort, but most of the time was spent in general meetings, with little in-depth involvement in the work areas and production, and little specific assistance to grassroots cadres in carrying out their work, or education for the workers. At the same time, some necessary and reasonable demands of the workers in terms of living conditions were not properly arranged and resolved in a timely manner.

Currently, with the help of the Mining Bureau Party Committee, Gaokeng Mine has begun to recognize these problems through inspection and is taking resolute measures to improve, striving to overfulfill the annual task.

    萍乡矿务局两个煤矿的生产对比情况证明
    增产煤炭必须深透发动群众
    王家源煤矿条件差生产先进　高坑煤矿条件好生产落后
    据江西日报消息　萍乡矿务局所属高坑和王家源两煤矿，条件一好一差，但是由于对待困难的态度不同，在发动群众上的深浅程度不同，领导工作作风和工作方法的不同，结果条件差的王家源矿，达到了高产高工效，而条件好的高坑矿却远远落在王家源矿后面。
    这两个矿，至5月份的生产对比情况是：每个采煤工人的日产量：王家源煤矿是3.877工吨；高坑矿是3.57工吨。每个工作面的平均月产量：王家源矿9，857吨；高坑矿是6，941吨。6月份，高坑矿不仅各项生产效率低于王家源矿，而且总绝对煤产量比王家源矿少3，595吨。
    高坑矿现有的劳动力比王家源矿多一千多人。主要的工具和设备，如煤车、溜子也都比王家源矿多。平巷运输机械化程度，高坑矿是97.68％，王家源矿是94.6％。两矿的地质条件，都是同一块煤田，采一样的煤层。采煤都是电钻打眼放炮装煤和风镐落煤两种方法，而且高坑矿的工作面的生产条件比王家源矿优越。
    那末，王家源生产搞的比较好，高坑矿生产落后的原因在哪里呢？主要是王家源矿在组织生产高潮中，领导上树立了相信群众，依靠群众的领导思想，认真贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，在各项工作中，干部群众同心协力，干劲十足。今年一开始，王家源矿由于坑木、楠木供应时断时续，接连两个月没有完成任务，截至3月上旬止，全矿共欠产八千六百多吨。在这样的困难面前，矿党总支积极地从主观上检查原因，发动群众想办法。他们根据矿务局党委的指示，利用各种宣传工具，向群众讲形势，讲任务，讲有利条件，讲先进经验，讲具体措施，讲新人新事，发动群众主动想办法克服困难。通过群众性的讨论研究，大家找出了关于前一阶段完不成任务的原因，并且提出了加强坑木回收、复用、代用，双风镐操纵，上下段交叉作业，加快循环进度，爆破装煤，组织机电抢修队等八项措施，充分发挥了设备的潜力，战胜了工作面短和设备不足的困难，使生产水平逐日上升。3月中旬提高5％，下旬又比中旬提高了32.6％，弥补了前两个月的亏欠，保证了第一季度的生产计划和各项经济指标的完成。高坑矿今年以来，没有一个月完成过生产任务，领导上却往往强调客观困难，认为条件不改变，生产就没法搞好。虽然他们也召开了不少的干部会议，采取了一些措施，但由于这些措施没有经过深入发动群众讨论，结果不是脱离实际，就是贯彻不下去。
    为了保证每个时期各项生产措施的贯彻实现，王家源矿在党总支委员会的统一领导下，把全盘工作划分为生产安全、机电运输、材料供应、生活福利、宣传鼓动等六个战线，三个大采掘区各配一个至两个领导干部具体帮助开展工作。他们建立了领导干部值班制，领导干部在井下跟班，发现问题及时解决处理。在工人生活福利方面，也有专人负责。有时因炊事人员忙不过来，领导干部还亲自给工人送馒头、茶水。这都激发了工人的生产热情，有力地促进了高产高质大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动。高坑矿在这方面虽然也作了很多工作，但比起王家源矿来显得不够。对于任务完成不好，群众思想混乱，劳动纪律松弛，劳动效率不高等问题，矿领导上虽也下过一些功夫，但是，大部分时间是花在一般的会议上，很少深入工区和生产中去，具体帮助基层干部进行工作，对职工进行教育。同时，对职工生活上一些必要的、合理的要求，也没有妥善安排及时解决。
    目前，高坑矿在矿务局党委的帮助下，通过检查，已开始认识到这些问题，并正在采取坚决措施，努力改进，力争全年任务超额完成。
