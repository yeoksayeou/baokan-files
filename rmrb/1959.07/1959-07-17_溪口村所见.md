What We Saw in Xikou Village
Wang Yingxian Qin Jiyao

Stepping out of the North Gate of Jianning County and climbing Qingyun Ridge along the Yanjian Highway, you can see Xikou Village at a glance. The newly planted trees on both sides of the highway that runs through the village stretch into the distance like a jade-green ribbon. At the foot of the nearby mountains, peach and plum trees with green branches bear abundant fruits. At the entrance of the village, in the lotus ponds beside the road, sparkling water droplets roll on the gracefully standing lotus leaves, and the bright and dazzling lotus flowers emit a intoxicating fragrance. Although the village consists of only a few hundred old wooden and tiled houses built haphazardly in several mountain gullies, the walls and doors of each house are washed very clean, and various styles of covered spittoons are placed at the entrance. The cobblestone-paved streets and alleys are swept so clean that they are almost reflective, and weeds within five feet of the village are completely cleared.

It was time to go to the fields, and the village was quiet, without a soul in sight. Only the village party branch secretary rushed back from the fields to act as our guide. We strolled into Qingyun Street, and an old woman, about fifty years old with a rosy face, greeted us with a smile, insisting on inviting us to her home for a rest. Unable to refuse the old woman's kindness, we took off our shoes and entered this one-and-a-half-story house. The interior was simply furnished, with bright windows and clean tables. On the front wall was a portrait of Chairman Mao, next to which was pasted a patriotic health pledge. Looking at the floor, it was as clean as the tabletop. One of my companions curiously wiped the back of the door and the window frames, and indeed, they were spotless. Comfortably lying on a bamboo chair, drinking the owner's rich and flavorful pre-Qingming green tea, I felt refreshed and relaxed.

"Is the 'evil aura' of this house still too heavy?" the village party branch secretary asked with a playful expression.

"Who still believes in that nonsense now? For good health, it's better to pay attention to hygiene!" the old woman avoided a direct answer, then turned her head and smiled embarrassedly at us.

This conversation piqued our interest, so we asked about it. The old woman then told us the whole story.

The old woman's name is Ding Dongnv. Her family used to have five members—herself, two sons, an elder daughter-in-law, and a grandson. In the past, the area around the house was overgrown with weeds and muddy everywhere. Three pigs and a large water buffalo were kept on the ground floor, which bred a large number of mosquitoes and flies in hot weather. The family lived upstairs, and the house was full of dirt and garbage, with a foul odor all year round. Because they didn't pay attention to hygiene, the whole family developed scabies. The elder son contracted filariasis, and his legs swelled as thick as gourds. The old woman didn't seek medical treatment but instead went to pray to gods and worship Buddha for him, wasting a lot of money. Because treatment was delayed, the elder son died of his illness. The elder daughter-in-law soon remarried with her child. The younger son had suffered from malaria for several years and could not participate in labor regularly, and the family became increasingly difficult. But in the past, they did not find the real reason for the many diseases, but only complained about bad luck. The old woman was once so heartbroken that she wanted to jump into the river, and also blamed the bad "feng shui," saying that the house faced a mountain depression and the "evil aura" was too heavy. She had always planned to move elsewhere. What about now? They still live in this house. The pigs and cattle have long been moved to the modern collective sheds in the fields, and the house, inside and out, up and down, left and right, is scrubbed clean in all directions. The younger son has also married a wife and given birth to a fat baby girl. Both husband and wife are labor models in the production team, and the granddaughter attends the nursery. The old woman also works in the nursery. Today happened to be the day the old woman was resting, allowing us to hear this story by chance.

This mountain village used to be known for its filth and epidemic diseases. It is close to the mountains and fields, with vast open spaces, rats and sparrows living in groups, and uneven terrain. Garbage and feces filled the streets and alleys, and more than a dozen stagnant, foul-smelling ponds and hundreds of pig and cattle pens and toilets surrounding the village were major breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies. Local diseases such as malaria, filariasis, pneumonia, influenza, and goiter were constantly prevalent, and "gourd legs," thick necks, and people with enlarged spleens could be seen everywhere in the village. Farmers within a radius of dozens of miles made an unflattering comment on this village, saying that the people of Xikou had three fews: few long-lived, few healthy, and few beautiful.

Since the launch of the mass patriotic health campaign, the people of the whole village have created and used more than sixty methods to eliminate the four pests in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, eliminating countless rats, sparrows, cockroaches, bedbugs, fleas, and lice. Measures such as covering and sealing toilets, diverting water into ponds to raise fish, and converting stagnant ditches into flowing ditches were also adopted to completely eliminate the breeding grounds of the four pests. Now malaria and filariasis have disappeared, and measles, pneumonia, and dysentery have been basically controlled. After communization, the village now has three medical clinics, and each production team has a health room and a new-style midwife.

Walking and talking, we have arrived at the edge of the village. Looking into the distance, the early rice in the fields has generally flowered and headed, and some is beginning to turn golden, becoming richer day by day. The days of a bumper summer harvest are approaching step by step from the southern Fujian region! From the joyful laboring farmers in the fields in the distance, came bursts of melodious singing.

It was noon, and the sound of conch shells, "Doo! Doo! Doo!" echoed from all directions, and the commune members returned in groups. Young men crowded around us and entered the farmers' collective canteen on Qingyun Street. The degree of hygiene in this canteen can be compared to the first-class restaurants in the city. There is tap water at the entrance for everyone to wash their hands before meals. Waiters wearing masks and white aprons come and go, and there is not a speck of dirt or grease on the tables, nor a fly to be seen. Meals are served separately, and although it is just some vegetables and tofu, the portions are large and the taste is very delicious.

After the meal, the whole village came alive. The Xinhua Bookstore, library, and club were all crowded with people. Several young people ran towards the court with basketballs in their arms; groups of three or five women gathered in the department store to choose newly arrived colorful fabrics; and some commune members took their pillows to find a cool and quiet place for a nap. It was at this time that we visited the nursery on Heping Street.

The nursery is about half a mile from the canteen. The nannies here are all women with only semi-labor power. When we entered, they were busy washing the children's faces. A caregiver put the children's used bowls, chopsticks, and spoons into a pot for disinfection. Every child has their own washcloth, bowl, chopsticks, and teacup, with their names written on them. One of the young caregivers told us: The nursery is thoroughly cleaned every three days, straw mats are washed every day, and bowls and chopsticks are disinfected every meal. Children's temperatures are checked every morning when they enter the nursery, and they are bathed and changed every day in hot weather. With the change of seasons, attention is paid to preventing various infectious diseases. In winter, children are fed Lithospermum erythrorhizon soup to prevent measles, in spring, they are vaccinated against smallpox, and in summer, they are injected with preventive vaccines against gastrointestinal infectious diseases. Therefore, in the past year or so, only a few children in the nursery have suffered from minor illnesses, and the vast majority have been safe and sound.

When we finished our visit to Xikou Village, everyone had a common feeling: Our people are undergoing a tremendous change. Our country will not only be built into a country with modern industry and modern agriculture in the near future, but also be able to become a highly civilized country that has eliminated the four pests and pays attention to hygiene.

[Editor's Note] The authors of this article, Wang Yingxian and Qin Jiyao, are both secretaries of the Jianning County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Fujian Province. For a long time, we have wanted to publish more articles by county party secretaries, factory and commune party secretaries, and other grassroots party secretaries, talking about your experiences and life.

    溪口村所见
    王英贤　秦继耀
    迈出建宁县北门，沿着延建公路登上青云岭，溪口村就尽览入目，贯穿全村的公路两旁新植的树木，宛如一条翡翠色的宝带伸向远方，近处的山脚下，伸着绿色枝干的桃树李树，悬挂着累累果实；村子头上，道旁莲塘中亭亭玉立的荷叶上滚动着银光闪闪的水珠，鲜艳夺目的荷花散发出阵阵醉人的清香。村子里虽只是一些参差不齐地建筑在几条山沟中的几百栋古旧的木房瓦屋，但是每家墙壁门户都洗刷得十分洁净，门口摆设着各种式样加盖的痰盂。用鹅卵石铺成的横街小巷，打扫得光可鉴人，村子周围五丈以内的杂草都铲得干干净净。
    这时正是下地的时候，村子里静悄悄的，不见一个人影，只有村支部书记从田中赶回为我们充当响导。我们信步走进青云街，一个年约五十多岁满面红光的老妈妈笑脸迎来，一定要请我们到她家里休息一会。却不过老人家的盛意，我们脱下鞋子走进了这所一楼一底的房屋。屋内陈设简单，窗明几净，正面墙上是毛主席像，旁边贴着爱国卫生公约。打量一下地板，擦洗得和桌面一样洁净。同伴中有人好奇地用手在门后和窗格上拭摸了一番，果然是一尘不染。舒适地躺在竹椅上，喝着主人斟给我们味醇色浓的雨前绿茶，真有一种心旷神怡的感觉。
    “这栋房子‘煞气’还太重吗？”村支部书记带着调皮的神情问道。
    “现在谁还相信这一套呢？要身体健康，还是讲究卫生的好！”老妈妈避开正面回答，说完偏过头来，怪难为情地对我们笑了一笑。
    这对话引起了我们的兴趣，便打听起究竟来，于是老妈妈就原原本本地叙述起往事来。
    老妈妈名叫做丁冬女，家里原有五口人——她、两个儿子、大儿媳和一个小孙子。过去住屋周围杂草丛生，遍地泥泞；楼底关了三头猪和一条大水牛，每到热天，就孳生出大量的蚊蝇；一家人住在楼上，房屋里积满污泥、垃圾，长年弥散着一股难闻的恶臭。由于不讲究卫生，全家人都长了疥疮。大儿子患上了血丝虫病，两条腿肿得像东瓜一样粗大，老妈妈不去找医师治疗，反去为他求神拜佛，冤枉钱不知花了多少，因为耽误了治疗，结果大儿子病重身死。大儿媳不久也带着小孩改嫁去了。小儿子几年来疟疾一直未离身，不能经常参加劳动，家境日益艰难。但是过去他们没有找出病害多的真正原因，只是埋怨命运不好，老妈妈曾经伤心得要去跳河，又怪“风水”不好，说房子面对山窝，“煞气”太重，一直打主意要搬到别处去住。现在呢？他们仍旧住在这栋房子里。猪和牛早已迁到田间现代化的集体栏舍里去了，房屋前后内外，上下左右，洗刷得八面光洁。小儿子也娶了媳妇，生下一个肥肥胖胖的小女孩。夫妻俩都是生产队里的劳动能手，小孙女上了托儿所。老妈妈也在托儿所工作。今天正是轮着老妈妈休息的日子，让我们碰巧听到了这一段故事。
    这个山村，过去是以肮脏和疾病流行出名的。它靠近山野，旷野阔，老鼠麻雀群居，地势高低不平，垃圾、粪便充塞大街小巷，十余口长年不干的臭水塘和数百间环绕全村的猪牛栏、厕所，更是孳生蚊蝇的大本营。疟疾、血丝虫病、肺炎、流行性感冒、甲状腺肿大等地方病不断流行，村子里到处可以碰到“东瓜腿”、粗脖子和脾脏肿胀的人。方圆数十里的农民对这个村子下了一个不光彩的评语，说溪口人有三少：命长的少，健壮的少，漂亮的少。
  自从展开群众性的爱国卫生运动后，全村人民创造与运用了六十多种多快好省除四害的办法，消灭了老鼠、麻雀、蟑螂、臭虫、跳蚤、虱子不计其数。并采取了厕所加盖密封，池塘引水养鱼，死水沟改活水沟等措施，彻底消灭四害孳生场所。现在疟疾和血丝虫病已经绝迹，麻疹、肺炎、痢疾已基本得到控制。公社化后，全村现在有三个医疗诊所，每个生产队都有保健室和新法接生员。
    边走边谈，我们已来到了村子边上。远远望去，田野里的早稻已普遍扬花吐穗，有的正开始涂金泛黄，一天浓似一天，夏季大丰收的日子，已从闽南地区步步迫近了！从远处地里欢乐劳动的农民群中，传来了阵阵悠扬的歌声。
    时已正午了，四面响起了“嘟！嘟！嘟！”的海螺声，社员们成群结队归来了。青年小伙子们簇拥着我们走进了青云街的农民集体食堂。这儿食堂讲究卫生的程度，可以和城市第一流的餐厅媲美。进门的地方有土自来水，供大家饭前洗手，服务员戴着口罩穿着白围裙来来往往，桌子上看不到一点污垢、油渍，也没有发现一只苍蝇。吃饭实行分食制，虽然只是一些青菜豆腐，但是分量很多，吃起来滋味也很鲜美。
    饭后，整个村子都活跃起来了。新华书店、图书馆、俱乐部里都挤满了人；有几个青年人抱着篮球向球场上跑去；三、五成群的妇女则围在百货商店选购新到的各色花布；也有的社员挟着枕头找阴凉安静的地方午睡去了。我们就在这个时候，去访问了和平街的托儿所。
    从食堂过去约有半里路程就到了托儿所。这里的阿姨都是些只有半劳动力的妇女。我们进去的时候，他们正在忙着给孩子们洗脸。一个保育员将孩子吃过的碗筷、调羹放进锅里消毒。每一个小孩都有自己的脸巾、碗筷、茶杯，上面写着他们的名字。保育员中一个年轻的姑娘告诉我们：托儿所三天大扫除一次，草席天天换洗，碗筷餐餐消毒，孩子每天早晨入所时要检查体温，热天每天要给孩子洗澡换衣。随着季节的转移，注意预防各种传染病。冬天给孩子吃紫草根汤防麻疹，春天种牛痘防天花，夏天注射防疫针预防肠胃传染病，因此，一年多来，入所的孩子只有少数害过小病，绝大多数平安无恙。
    当我们结束在溪口村的这次访问时，大家有一个共同的感觉：我国人民正在经历着一次巨大的变化。我国不仅能够在不久的将来建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业的国家，同样，也能够成为一个除尽四害、讲究卫生的高度文明的国家。
    〔编者附记〕本文作者王英贤、秦继耀两同志，都是中共福建省建宁县委书记。很久以来，我们就想发表更多的县委书记、工厂、公社等基层党委书记的文章，谈谈你们的见闻和生活。这也是读者们的要求，我们希望能得到同志们的支持。
