When You Visit West Lake
By our reporters Li Xinmin and Ren Zhaoying

Summer in Hangzhou is a sea of green. Rows of plane trees, poplars, willows, and Chinese scholar trees line the roads, their foliage lush and verdant. On West Lake, the green Solitary Hill, the green Bai Causeway and Su Causeway, the green lotus leaves, the green lake water – everywhere you look, there’s a feeling of freshness, coolness, and comfort.

Every day, trains, buses, ships, and airplanes bring over ten thousand people from all parts of the country and corners of the world to Hangzhou for sightseeing, summer retreats, and other business. Service workers in Hangzhou's service industries diligently serve travelers day and night, catering to their needs for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation.

　　　　The游船 on Land

Hangzhou streets are filled with tricycles of various colors. On clear days, the tricycles are adorned with canopies of various printed fabrics, the fabric trim around the canopies fluttering in the breeze. Travelers sit in the spacious, cool vehicles, calling them "land boats."

Tricycle workers are often the first Hangzhou residents travelers encounter. As soon as you get on a tricycle, they will hand you the day's newspaper they've prepared for you. If you want to know about the locations of hotels and restaurants in Hangzhou, the performances at theaters, or the characteristics of various scenic spots, they will give you detailed information. If you want to find someone, they will help you find clues, inquire everywhere on your behalf, until you locate them.

Travelers write words of praise and thanks in the tricycles' suggestion books. The guests who write these comments come from all over the country, as well as from fraternal countries like the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia.

Young tricycle worker Yu Senmu has had his service attitude praised by 240 guests this year. In his work, there are many touching stories. Once, PLA soldier Zhang Yueyun came to Hangzhou from the Fujian front line and wanted to see West Lake, but he didn't know the way. When Yu Senmu found out, he drew him a detailed map of the West Lake route and drove him to the lakeside on his tricycle. The next day, he used his day off to accompany him on a tour. The two became close friends, exchanging letters and local specialties after they parted. Zhang Yueyun even gave some of his beloved prizes to Yu Senmu.

　　　　A Home for Travelers

One day, among the crowd on the platform of the Hangzhou Railway Station, two middle-aged women were bidding farewell to a young man with a Northern accent who was about to board a train. Those who saw this warm scene thought they were close relatives or friends. In fact, they had never met before.

It turned out that this young man was a cadre from the Shenyang Voltage Switch Factory who came to Hangzhou on official business at the end of last year and stayed at the Lakeside Hotel. The room he stayed in was managed by the Zhu Yue'e group, active participants in socialist construction in Zhejiang Province. This group consisted of female employees who were very patient in serving travelers, making this newcomer like staying there very much, and they gradually became familiar with each other. Soon, the traveler's hemorrhoids flared up, and he was bedridden for more than a week. The Zhu Yue'e group helped him register for treatment at the hospital, brought him soup and water. When he couldn't eat, they brought porridge from home to feed him. Under their careful care, his hemorrhoids healed. The young man was truly grateful for the sisters' meticulous care.

When the traveler finished his business, he was about to return to Shenyang. The Zhu Yue'e group sent Song Dongying and Yu Zhihua as representatives to see the young man off to the train.

To facilitate travelers, the staff of the Lakeside Hotel also put forward the slogan of letting customers "not leave the door for five things": eating, bathing, getting a haircut, buying train tickets, and buying movie tickets. Recently, this hotel has added a restaurant, a barbershop, a bathroom, and a small shop, and also buys train tickets and movie tickets for travelers. If travelers need to go out on rainy days and don't have rain gear, there are also umbrellas and rain boots for rent. Travelers say that the old saying "It's good to be at home for a thousand days, but it's hard to be away for even a moment" is no longer applicable in today's society.

The Lakeside Hotel is just one of the many hotels lining West Lake. The staff of the entire hotel industry in Hangzhou are brainstorming ideas to improve work efficiency and equipment utilization, while also increasing the number of beds and adding service items. The newly completed Overseas Chinese Hotel, although not yet officially open, has already received hundreds of domestic travelers and overseas Chinese who have returned to visit. The barbershops, bathrooms, etc. near these hotels have also taken many measures to facilitate travelers.

　　　　Eat Conveniently and Enjoy the Trip to the Fullest

Some new restaurants have been added in Hangzhou's scenic spots and transportation hubs, and the existing restaurants have also expanded their business. The service staff have devoted their wisdom and labor to making it easier for travelers to eat.

Many travelers to Hangzhou love to visit Wu Hill in the city. Here, you can overlook the Qiantang River and West Lake. The Dongshenglou teahouse newly built on the mountain is very popular with tourists. Along both sides of the road at the top of the mountain, rattan chairs and bamboo chairs are neatly arranged. The fragrant Longjing tea wafts through the air. Tourists can rest, enjoy tea, admire the summer scenery, play chess, or play cards here. In the Dongshenglou teahouse, travelers can eat the famous Wu Hill Su You Bing (酥油饼), have lunch, with wine and meat, pastries, and various breads. Only a few days after opening, guests have already left letters of praise for the service staff.

After resting, you can tour around to your heart's content. When you get tired, you can find clean and bright tea shops everywhere to rest. The beautiful West Lake is so picturesque during the day, and the night scenery is also very attractive. Travelers to Hangzhou always love to spend this midsummer night with the people of Hangzhou, by the lake, at various scenic spots, and in the city's cultural and entertainment venues.

    当你到西湖作客的时候
    本报记者  李新民  任兆英
    夏天的杭州，是一片绿色的海洋。马路两旁整齐地排列着梧桐树、杨树、柳树和槐树，枝叶葱茏，青翠欲滴。在西湖上，绿色的孤山，绿色的白堤和苏堤，绿色的荷叶，绿色的湖水，到处给人清新、凉爽、舒适的感觉。
    每天，火车、汽车、轮船和飞机把一万多人从祖国各地和世界各个角落送来杭州，来游览、避暑和作其他事情。杭州市服务性行业的服务员们，日日夜夜为旅客的衣食住行而殷勤地服务着。
          陆地上的游船
    杭州街上行驶着各种颜色的三轮车。在晴朗的天气里，三轮车装上了各种各样印花的布篷，篷四周的布檐迎风飘动。旅客坐在车上，宽敞凉爽，把它称为“陆地上的游船”。
    三轮车工人是许多旅客来到杭州碰到的第一个杭州人。当你一登上车，他们就会把为你准备好的当天的报纸送到你手上；假如你想了解杭州的旅馆和饮食店的分布情况，戏院演出的节目，各个风景区的特点，他们就会向你作详细的介绍。你想找人，他们便会帮助你寻找线索，到处代你探问，直到有了着落为止。
    旅客们把表扬和感谢的语言写在三轮车的意见簿上。写这些意见的客人，有的来自祖国各地，也有的来自苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等兄弟国家。
    年轻的三轮车工人俞森木，今年以来已经有二百四十个客人提笔表扬他的服务态度。在他的工作中，有许多动人的故事。有一次，解放军战士张岳云从福建前线来杭州，想去看看西湖，可是路途不熟。俞森木知道了，就详细地给他画了一张西湖路线图，并且驾着三轮车把他拉到湖滨，第二天又利用自己休假的机会，陪他出游。两人成了亲密的朋友，分手以后还互相写信和寄送土特产，张岳云把自己心爱的一些奖品也送给了俞森木。
      旅客之家
    一天，在杭州火车站月台上的人群中，有两个中年妇女同要登车的一个北方口音的青年人依依话别。旁人看了这种热情场面，总以为他们是至亲好友。其实呢，以前他们并不相识。
    原来，这个青年人是沈阳电压开关厂的干部，去年年底因公来杭，住进湖滨旅馆。他住的房间，由浙江省社会主义建设积极分子祝月娥小组负责。这个小组都是女职工，对招待旅客非常耐心，使这个新来的旅客由不习惯到很喜欢住在这里，而且他们之间慢慢熟悉起来。不久，这个旅客痔疮复发，有一个多星期躺在床上不能动弹。祝月娥小组人员就帮他到医院挂号就诊，端汤送水。他不能吃饭，她们就从家里烧稀饭带来给他吃。在她们细心的照顾下，他的痔疮好了。这个青年人对姐妹们的无微不至的关怀真是感激不尽。
    这个旅客办完公事，要回沈阳去了。祝月娥小组就派宋冬英、俞芷华两人为代表，一直把这个青年人送上火车。
    为了方便旅客，湖滨旅馆的职工还提出让顾客“五不出门”的口号，就是吃、洗澡、理发、买车票和影戏票不出门。最近，这家旅馆增设了餐厅、理发室、浴室、小卖部，并且代旅客买火车票、影戏票。如果旅客雨天有事要出门，没有雨具，这里还备有出租雨伞和雨鞋。旅客说，过去那句老话“在家千日好，出外一时难”，在今天的社会里已经不适用了。
    湖滨旅馆，只是西子湖畔林立的旅馆群中的一个。杭州市整个旅馆业的职工都在动脑筋想办法，提高工作效率和设备利用率，同时增加床位，增添服务项目。新近完工的华侨旅馆，现在虽然还没有正式开放，可是已经接待了国内旅客和回国观光的华侨几百人。靠近这一带旅馆的理发店、浴室等也都采取了许多方便旅客的措施。
              吃得方便游得痛快
    在杭州的风景区和交通要道，新增加了一些饮食店，原有的饮食店也扩大了业务，服务人员为着旅客的饮食方便而付出了自己的智慧和劳动。
    许多到杭州来的旅客爱到城里的吴山游览。在这里，可以俯视钱塘江和西子湖。山上新设的东升楼茶室受到游客的极大欢迎。沿着山顶的道路两旁，藤椅和竹椅整齐地排列着，龙井茶芬芳扑鼻，游客们可以在这里一面休息品茶，一面欣赏夏景或下棋、打扑克。在东升楼茶室里，旅客们可以吃到著名的吴山酥油饼，可以进午餐，有酒有肉，有糕点，也有各种面包。开店才几天，就已经有客人留下了对服务员的表扬信。
    休息过后，你可以到处尽兴游览。游得疲倦了，又可以随处找到窗明几净的茶店休息。美丽的西湖白天是那样绮丽如画，夜景也非常诱人。来杭州的旅客总爱和杭州人民一起，在湖滨，在各个风景点，在市内的文化娱乐场所，欢度这仲夏之夜。（附图片）
