Bacteria, Flies, and Foci of Infection
	Wei Yu

	More and more facts and materials, like lab reports from a pathology lab, all prove that American imperialism is a fly that spreads bacteria everywhere. Wherever it flies, crawls, or bites, it spreads the bacteria of war and harm to peaceful people, causing inflammation, pus formation, and ulceration there.

	Last December, in South Vietnam, the American-Ngo clique created the bloody incident at the Phu Loi concentration camp, collectively and cruelly murdering more than a thousand people with poison. This was a malignant outbreak of American bacteria.

	In South Vietnam, the "Denounce Communists, Eliminate Communists" movement launched by the American-Ngo clique, their arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and massacres of peaceful people are happening everywhere, every moment. Which of these is not American bacteria at work?

	This year, the reactionary Lao authorities flagrantly violated the Geneva Accords and launched an attack on the Second Battalion of the Pathet Lao Fighting Forces, causing a civil war. The "laboratory report" shows that American war bacteria are at work there again.

	To observe the spread of American bacteria, one does not necessarily need a microscope. Look at the ships full of war materials, the thousands of American military personnel, the atomic weapons or rockets being prepared to be transported into South Vietnam, the airfields for American military aircraft being built in South Vietnam…etc., are these not the spread of bacteria? Thus, a new focus of infection has been created in South Vietnam: the Americans are "turning South Vietnam into one of the most important military bases of the United States in Southeast Asia." This focus of infection is being connected to some other foci of infection (such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) in order to launch and expand war in the Far East and subject the people of the entire Southeast Asia to death.

	The evil American bacteria have already devoured so many vital cells in various parts of the world! Can the price paid by humanity for it be completely accounted for with numbers?

	To restore the unified, independent, and happy life of all the Vietnamese people, and to ensure the consolidated peaceful life of the people of Southeast Asia and the people of the world, the only way is to eliminate the focus of infection formed in South Vietnam, eliminate the pus, and eradicate the bacteria.

	The body of the world giant is strong, its vitality is infinite, and each of us is a fresh cell on this giant, a fresh blood cell in the blood. We must take action, use blood to surround and extinguish the evil bacteria, and use our giant-like hands to swat the fly that spreads the bacteria!

    细菌·苍蝇·病灶
    魏郁
    越来越多的事实、资料，就好像病理化验室里的化验单，件件都证明：美国帝国主义是一只到处传播细菌的苍蝇。它飞到哪里，爬到哪里，叮到哪里，就把战争和惨害和平人民的细菌撒布在哪里，使那里发炎、汇脓、溃烂。
    去年12月，在越南南部，美吴集团制造了富利集中营血腥事件，用毒药集体惨杀一千多人，这是美国细菌的一次恶性的发作。
    在越南南部，美吴集团发动的“诉共、灭共”运动，他们对和平人民的逮捕、拷打、监禁、屠杀，时时处处都在发作，哪一件又不是美国细菌在那里起作用？
    今年，老挝反动当局，悍然违反日内瓦协议，向前寮国战斗部队第二营发动进攻，造成内战，“化验”的结果，又是美国战争细菌在那里活动。
    观察美国细菌的传播，并不一定要用显微镜才能发现。请看，那一船船的战争物资，那数以千计的美国军事人员，那准备运入越南南部的原子武器或火箭，在南越修筑的美国军用飞机的机场……等等，岂不都是细菌的蔓延。于是，在越南南部就造成了这样一个新的病灶：美国人正在“把南越变成美国在东南亚的头等重要的军事基地之一”。这个病灶，正在同一些其他的病灶（如东南亚条约集团）联结，以便发动和扩大远东的战争，制整个东南亚人民于死命。
    万恶的美国细菌，在世界各地已经吞噬了多少富有生命力的细胞啊！人类为它付出的代价，难道是能用数字完全统计出来的吗？
    要恢复全体越南人民统一、独立、幸福的生活，要保障东南亚人民、全世界人民的巩固的和平生活，只有消灭越南南部形成的那个病灶，把脓液排除，把细菌扑灭。
    世界巨人的躯体是强大的，生命力是无穷的，我们每一个人，都是这个巨人身上的一个新鲜细胞，血液里一个新鲜血球。我们要行动起来，用血液包围和扑灭那万恶的细菌，用我们巨人般的手，去扑打那只散播细菌的苍蝇！
