    Grasp Planning, Catch Up with the Advanced, Mining and Excavation Side by Side
    Hegang Xin Yi Mine Continues "Ten-Thousand-Ton Mine" Record for Four and a Half Months
    (Our dispatch) Hegang Xin Yi Mine reached the "Ten-Thousand-Ton Mine" standard of the national coal large-scale bumper harvest red flag competition for four consecutive months from March to June. Since entering July, the daily production level of this mine has continued to consolidate above the level of a ten-thousand-ton mine.
    The main experience of this mine in winning the title of "Ten-Thousand-Ton Mine" for four consecutive months is to strengthen the leadership of the Party, focus on ideological work, have cadres go deep into the front line, and mobilize and rely on the masses to discuss the monthly, ten-day, and daily production plans well. In order to ensure the overfulfillment of the plan, the mine-level leaders grasp the ten-day plan, check daily, and balance the entire mine every two days; the mining area grasps the daily plan, checks by shift, and balances the entire area every day; the shift grasps the original shift plan, checks by group, and the original shift balances. Therefore, from the mine to the group, a system is formed to grasp the plan at all levels, calculate every day, calculate every shift, and explain to the workers so that the workers have a clear understanding, clear goals, and full enthusiasm.
    During the red flag competition, the entire mine focused on improving operating techniques and strengthening production management, establishing and improving regulations and systems suitable for production needs, especially promoting various effective advanced experiences. This is also an important aspect of achieving a large-scale bumper harvest. At present, more than 20 mining and excavation sites in the entire mine have promoted more than ten advanced experiences such as blasting coal loading, one cut one shot, shallow cutting, quick running, and multiple cycles. In the spirit of attaching equal importance to mining and excavation, the mine has vigorously strengthened the leadership of production preparation work such as excavation and machinery maintenance while completing the raw coal production plan. The mine is led by an engineer, and the section is led by a deputy district chief, specializing in production preparation work. This lays a good foundation for continued leap forward in the future.
    At present, the employees of this mine have expressed their determination to comprehensively overfulfill the tasks of the third quarter, create higher achievements, consolidate the "Ten-Thousand-Ton Mine", and present gifts to the National Day.

    抓计划赶先进采掘并举
    鹤岗新一矿连续四个半月保持“万吨矿”纪录
    本报讯　鹤岗新一矿在3到6月份连续四个月达到全国煤炭大面积丰产红旗竞赛“万吨矿”标准。进入7月以来，这个矿日产水平仍然继续巩固在万吨矿水平以上。
    这个矿连续四个月获得“万吨矿”的主要经验是加强了党的领导，抓紧思想工作，干部深入第一线，发动和依靠群众讨论好月、旬、日的生产计划。为了保证计划的超额完成，矿级领导抓住旬计划，按日检查，每两天全矿平衡；采区抓日计划，按班检查，全区每天平衡；班抓原班计划，按小组检查，原班平衡。因此，从矿到组形成层层抓计划，天天算，班班算，向工人交底，使工人心中有数，目标明确，干劲十足。
    全矿在红旗竞赛中，抓紧了改进操作技术和加强生产管理，建立与健全适应生产需要的规程制度，特别是推广各种行之有效的先进经验。这也是获得大面积丰产的一个重要方面。目前全矿二十多个采掘场子推广了爆破装煤，一刀一炮，浅截快跑多循环等十多种先进经验。这个矿本着采掘并举的精神，在完成原煤生产计划的同时，大力加强了掘进，整修机械等生产准备工作的领导，矿由一名工程师，段由一个副区长专门领导生产准备工作。为今后继续跃进打下良好基础。
    目前，这个矿职工纷纷表示要全面超额完成三季度任务，创更高成绩，巩固“万吨矿”，向国庆节献礼。
