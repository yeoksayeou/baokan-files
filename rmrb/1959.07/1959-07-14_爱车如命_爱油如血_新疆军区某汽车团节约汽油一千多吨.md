Cherishing Vehicles Like Life, Loving Oil Like Blood
A Motor Vehicle Regiment of the Xinjiang Military Region Saves Over a Thousand Tons of Gasoline

    (Reported by this newspaper) In over 23 million kilometers of driving over the past four years, a motor vehicle regiment of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has extended the interval mileage between repairs by over 10.02 million vehicle kilometers and saved over 1,100 tons of gasoline.
    In recent years, this regiment has persistently carried out revolutionary emulation activities centered on safety and economy. Officers and soldiers "cherish vehicles like life and love oil like blood," constantly improving and enhancing operating techniques, strengthening vehicle maintenance, adhering to various oil-saving systems such as measuring oil consumption during journeys for comparison, and devising many ways to save non-production oil consumption. For example, using less oil when cleaning parts, washing engines with soapy water, and using cotton to soak up oil from empty barrels when refueling. As a result, the regiment's oil-saving performance has steadily improved. According to the oil consumption standards stipulated by higher authorities, they saved 9.9% in 1955, 25.46% in the first to third quarters of last year, and even though the load capacity increased and the quality of oil slightly declined in the first quarter of this year, they still saved 16%. Over the past four years, the value of the fuel they saved amounted to as much as 870,000 yuan.
    Simultaneously with the fuel-saving campaign, the motor vehicle drivers strengthened the maintenance and upkeep of vehicles, making every effort to extend the repair interval mileage of vehicles. After comprehensively learning from the advanced Soviet experience in improving cylinder liner quotas, all vehicles in the regiment exceeded the intermediate and major repair interval mileage targets stipulated by higher authorities. Over the past four years, they saved the state 1.04 million yuan in repair costs.
    This year, the regiment has further improved vehicle dispatch work, implemented task contracts, and delegated the authority to utilize return vehicles to the company level, stimulating the enthusiasm of company-level cadres and drivers. As a result, new leaps forward have been made in safe driving, utilization of return vehicles, and fuel saving. From January to June 20 this year, the regiment has safely driven nearly three million kilometers, the volume of transportation has increased by two times compared with the same period last year, and they have turned over 1 million yuan in freight charges from the utilization of return vehicles.

    爱车如命　爱油如血
    新疆军区某汽车团节约汽油一千多吨
    本报讯　中国人民解放军新疆军区某汽车团，在最近四年的两千三百多万公里行车中，延长修理间隔里程一千零两万多车公里，节约汽油一千一百多吨。
    几年来，这个团坚持不懈地开展了以安全、节约为中心的革命竞赛活动。官兵们“爱车如命，爱油如血”，不断改进和提高操作技术，加强车辆保养，坚持途中量油对比等各种节约用油的制度，并想出许多节省非生产用油的办法。如：清洗机件少用油，洗引擎用肥皂水，加油时用棉花沾干油桶等。因此节约油的成绩不断上升，按上级规定的耗油标准，1955年节约了9.9％，去年一至三季度节约了25.46％，今年第一季度虽然载重量增加，油的质量也稍有下降，仍节约了16％。四年来，他们节约的油料折价达八十七万元之多。
    与节约油料的竞赛的同时，汽车驾驶员们加强车辆的维护和保养，千方百计延长车辆的修理间隔里程。他们全面学习了苏联改进搪缸限额的先进经验以后，全团所有车辆都超过了上级规定的中修和大修间隔里程的指标。四年来，为国家节下的修理费用等一百零四万元。
    今年，这个团进一步改进了车辆调度工作，实行了任务包干，并把利用回空车辆的权限下放到连队，激发了连队干部和驾驶员的积极性，因此在安全行车、利用回空车辆和节省油料等方面又有了新的跃进。今年1月到6月20日，全团已安全行车近三百万公里，运输量比去年同期增加了两倍，并上缴了利用回空车辆运费一百万元。
