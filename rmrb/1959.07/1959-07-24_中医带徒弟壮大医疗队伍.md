Traditional Chinese Medicine Mentors Bring in Apprentices to Strengthen the Medical Ranks

    In Hunan Province, the number of Traditional Chinese Medicine apprentices has reached over 11,000, with more than 1,000 having completed their studies and taken up positions.
    Ba County arranges study time according to the agricultural slack and busy seasons.
    Fuyang Prefecture, while organizing experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners to mentor apprentices, also adopts methods such as running semi-detached advanced training classes and correspondence courses to improve the level of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

    This newspaper reports that while strengthening medical and health schools at all levels, Hunan Province attaches great importance to using the traditional method of experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners mentoring apprentices, to cultivate a large number of new Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners. Currently, the total number of apprentices in the province is over 11,000, with more than 1,000 having completed their training and taken up positions.
    The health administrative departments of various counties and cities in Hunan have strengthened their leadership in this work. They have organized local health worker associations or Traditional Chinese Medicine associations to set up teaching and research committees or groups for Traditional Chinese Medicine mentorship. These committees or groups are responsible for mastering the overall teaching work and discussing and exchanging experiences in teaching. In most areas, a combination of centralized classes and individual mentorship is used, leveraging the combined medical institutions. First, centralized classes are held to enable students to systematically learn politics, the basic theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and culture in a step-by-step manner, laying a good foundation. Then, they individually apprentice with experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners. This makes it easier to promote the advantages of traditional teaching methods such as oral instruction and close integration with clinical practice. The learning methods of the apprentices are also diverse, including full-time study, part-time work-study, and flexible learning based on agricultural busy and slack seasons, as well as spare-time study.
    During clinical practice with their mentors, the students generally gain a more systematic and practical understanding of the basic theoretical knowledge of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In teaching, all regions pay attention to implementing the educational policy of combining education with productive labor. In addition to participating in general social labor and productive labor, students particularly emphasize engaging in labor related to medicine and pharmaceuticals in conjunction with teaching. For example, in Yueyang, Hengshan, Qianyang, Liling and other counties, the units that organize centralized learning also organize students to collect and plant medicinal herbs. In the process of cultivation and harvesting, they not only gradually understand the shape and growing season of the herbs, but also become familiar with their properties and applications.

    This newspaper reports that Ba County in Chongqing City is taking effective measures to actively cultivate new forces in Traditional Chinese Medicine.
    Ba County mainly adopts the method of focusing on full-time training, combined with both full-time and part-time approaches to train apprentices. Because relying on two approaches adapts to the current situation of rapid production development, more people participate in the study. In terms of learning methods, the county adopts a combination of collective teaching and decentralized mentorship. Each commune and management district, based on this principle, arranges the study of Traditional Chinese Medicine apprentices according to local conditions, time, and available resources. Where transportation conditions are poor and there is a lack of Traditional Chinese Medicine teachers, the commune focuses on theoretical lessons; where transportation conditions are good and the teaching force is relatively strong, theoretical lessons are arranged in the management district. Each commune flexibly arranges study time according to the agricultural busy and slack seasons. For example, during the busy season, apprentices and teachers participate in mobile medical work together, using the evening time for theoretical study.
    In order to further improve the quality of teaching, solve the problems of teacher shortages and unified teaching materials in general communes, Ba County, while continuing to implement the principle of collective teaching and decentralized mentorship, has further improved the learning form of full-time apprentices; the past practice of centralized classes in communes and management districts has been changed to classes in county-run apprentice training classes. Here, a teaching force with higher medical standards and richer experience is concentrated. After a period of centralized study each year, they return to the commune to practice with the teachers designated by the commune hospital.
    Part-time apprentices are mainly organized to study through a combination of centralized classes and decentralized self-study. The study time for this group of apprentices is arranged by the teachers in conjunction with the busy and slack seasons of agricultural affairs. Generally, they gather for six times a month, half a day each time, and usually study books designated by the teachers in a decentralized manner, with dedicated personnel responsible for tutoring. Since Ba County adopted these methods to organize Traditional Chinese Medicine mentorship, it has achieved good results, and the apprentices have already understood a lot of basic knowledge of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, is organizing experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners to mentor apprentices, actively cultivating new Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners.
    Fuyang Prefecture has more than 400 experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners, all with more than 30 years of medical experience, accumulating a lot of clinical experience. In order to receive their valuable experience and theoretical knowledge, the prefecture and various counties have successively organized more than 2,700 in-service Western medicine doctors and young students who are interested in the Traditional Chinese Medicine career to learn from them.
    In the teaching process, the experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners impart their knowledge and experience to their apprentices without reservation, and the apprentices also study diligently and humbly, so the relationship between teachers and apprentices is close and the teaching effect is very good. The famous doctor Guan Ruiting of Bo County, in order to enable his apprentice Dai Suying to master Traditional Chinese Medicine technology quickly, took his apprentice with him every time he went out for diagnosis, and repeatedly explained the condition to him after the diagnosis, and also explained the properties, effects, and dosage of the medicine in detail when prescribing. Among the more than 2,700 apprentices brought by experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners in the entire prefecture, 2,057 have been able to independently undertake medical work and become a vital force in the rural medical team.
    While organizing experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners to mentor apprentices, Fuyang Prefecture also adopts various forms such as semi-detached advanced training classes and correspondence courses to improve the medical theoretical level of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The county and district health associations also organize experienced and knowledgeable Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners to conduct roving guidance in various places to help other Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners improve their medical standards, so that they can play a greater role in medical work.

    中医带徒弟壮大医疗队伍
    湖南全省中医学徒已达一万一千多名，其中一千多名已学习期满，走上工作岗位。
    巴县根据农闲农忙情况来推动安排学习时间。
    阜阳专区在组织老中医带徒弟的同时，还采取办半脱产进修班、函授班等办法，提高中医水平。
    本报讯　湖南省在加强各级医学卫生学校的同时，十分重视运用中医带徒弟的传统方式，大量培养新中医。现在全省学徒总数在一万一千名以上，其中有一千多名期满，已走上工作岗位。
    湖南各县市的卫生行政部门加强了对这项工作的领导，组织了当地卫生工作者协会或中医学会专设中医带徒弟的教学研究委员会或小组，负责掌握总的教学工作，讨论和交流教学工作经验。绝大部分地区，都是运用联合医疗机构采取集中上课与个别从师相结合的教学方法，先集中上课，使学员有步骤地系统学习政治、中医基本理论和文化，打好基础；然后再个别拜老中医为师。这样，更便于发扬口传心授、密切结合临床的传统教学方法的优点。学徒的学习方式也多种多样，有脱产全日学的，有半工半读的，还有农忙少学、农闲多学，业余学习等。
    学员们在随师临症实习中，一般对中医基本理论知识都进一步有了比较系统的实际理解。在教学中，各地都注意贯彻了教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针。学员除参加一般的社会劳动和生产劳动以外，特别重视结合教学从事有关医药工作的劳动。如岳阳、衡山、黔阳、醴陵等县集中学习的单位，组织学员采药种药，在栽培采挖中，他们不仅逐渐懂得药物的形态、生长季节，还熟悉了它们的性能和应用范围。
    本报讯　重庆市巴县采取有效措施，积极培养中医新生力量。
    巴县培养学徒的办法主要是采取以脱产为主，脱产和不脱产相结合的两条腿走路的方法。因为依靠两条腿走路，适应当前生产飞跃发展的形势，所以参加学习的人较多。在学习方法上这个县是采取集体授课和分散从师相结合的办法。各公社、管理区根据这个原则，因地、因时、因条件制宜地安排中医学徒的学习。交通条件不好，又缺乏中医教师，就集中公社上理论课；交通条件好的，师资力量比较雄厚，就在管理区安排理论课。各公社根据农忙农闲的情况来机动安排学习时间。如农忙时，学徒就和老师一道参加巡回医疗工作，改用晚上的时间进行理论学习。
    为了进一步提高教学质量，为一般公社解决师资缺乏和统一教材的问题，巴县在继续贯彻集体授课和分散从师的原则下，目前又进一步改进了脱产学徒的学习形式；把过去集中在公社、管理区上课，改为在县办的学徒训练班上课。这里集中了医学水平较高，经验较丰富的师资力量。每年集中学习一段时间以后，再回公社跟从公社医院指定的老师实习。
    不脱产的学徒主要是用集中授课、分散自修的办法组织学习。这部分学徒的学习时间是由老师结合农事季节忙闲情况进行安排。一般是每月集中学六次，每次半天，平时分散自修老师指定阅读的书籍，并有专人负责辅导。巴县采取上面这些办法组织中医带徒弟以后，已取得了较好效果，学徒们已经懂得了许多中医的基础知识。
    据新华社讯　安徽省阜阳专区组织老中医带徒弟，积极培养新中医。
    阜阳专区有四百多名老中医，都具有三十年以上的医龄，积累了较多的临床经验。为了把他们的宝贵经验和理论知识接受下来，专区和各县先后组织在职西医和有志于中医事业的青年学生二千七百多人，向他们学习。
    在教学过程中，老中医无保留地把自己的知识、经验精心地教给徒弟，徒弟们也都刻苦钻研、虚心地学习，所以师徒关系亲密无间，教学效果很好。亳县名医冠瑞廷，为了让徒弟戴素英能够较快地掌握中医技术，每次出诊时都带着徒弟，诊断后还反复向他讲解病情，处方时也详细地讲解药性、药效和应用的药量。全专区老中医所带二千七百多名徒弟中，已有二千零五十七人能独立担任医疗工作，成为农村医疗队伍的生力军。
    阜阳专区在组织老中医带徒弟的同时，还采取半脱产进修班、函授班等多种形式，提高中医的医学理论水平。县、区卫生协会并组织有经验、有学理的老中医到各地巡回辅导，帮助其他中医提高医疗水平，使他们在医疗工作中发挥更大的作用。（附图片）
