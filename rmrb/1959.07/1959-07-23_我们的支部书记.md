    “Our Branch Secretary”
    Wang Lin
    A Party branch secretary in a village (production team) is a socialist model for the entire village. His every move affects the spiritual state and material life of the whole village. Xing Zhengang, the Party branch secretary of Zhongsong Village in Wu Renqiao People's Commune, Anguo County, left me with a very strong impression in this regard.
    Zhongsong Village used to be a well-known poor village with 117 households and 809 mu of land. Before the land reform, 70% of the land was controlled by a few landlords and rich peasants. For many years, more than 70 households relied on going out to work short-term jobs, being hired laborers, begging, and renting land from landlords to make a living. After the land reform and advanced agricultural cooperatives, the lives of the masses improved somewhat, but because the Party branch at that time was controlled by rich peasant elements, they had no confidence in running the commune diligently and thriftily to transform the poor village into a rich one. They only reached out to the state for loans and relief grain. Therefore, until 1957, the state had to supply an average of 70,000 jin of food grain every year. Although Xing Zhengang served as the village farmers' association director as soon as work began in 1939, and persisted in the most brutal war of resistance against Japan, he was always squeezed out by Party members from rich peasant backgrounds. In the summer of 1957, he took over as the Party branch secretary and thoroughly eliminated the corruption of rich peasant elements among Party members, Communist Youth League members, and the masses of the entire village. Then, in 1958, he responded to the wise call of the Party Central Committee for the Great Leap Forward, implementing measures such as drilling machine wells, mechanical irrigation, leveling land, and transforming it into garden plots. This enabled the village to quickly transform from poor to rich. In the first year of bumper harvest (1958), they turned over 127,000 jin of public grain and sold surplus grain to the state. After this year's wheat harvest, they will sell another 150,000 jin of wheat to the state. What an amazing change! Therefore, the people in this village, whether they are seventy or eighty-year-old men and women, or ten-year-old elementary school students, all affectionately call Xing Zhengang: "Our Branch Secretary."
    The first time I went to Zhongsong Village, before I even entered the village, I saw Comrade Xing Zhengang holding a sprayer and teaching two little girls how to spray pesticide to control aphids on cotton seedlings. When he saw me walking towards him, he handed the sprayer to the little girls and walked towards me. He was in his fifties, not very tall, but very strong. He had a broad forehead, shrewd eyes, sunken cheeks that made his stubble stand out, and was full of energy, his face filled with confidence and determination.
    After I gave him my letter of introduction, he asked me to come into the village and sit down. I preferred to follow him around in the fields. So we wandered around the garden-like wheat fields. When we encountered problems, he dealt with them on the spot. When he had a moment, he would tell me about the situation. The whole village has more than eight qing of land, and more than seven qing of wheat was planted last autumn. Everywhere was a golden sea of wheat fields. In the middle of the wheat fields was a garden plot planted with multi-spiked sorghum, with each rectangular seedling bed like a green plaid cloth. He said that before the Great Leap Forward, this was an uneven, grave-filled hill. There was another piece of land where the wheat was growing tall and even, with the wheat ears as big as garlic braids. He said that this used to be a leaky piece of land, and the "three fix" (three guarantees) set the yield at 60 jin per mu, but the landowner was unwilling to accept it. Last year, the land was deeply plowed, and the layer of quicksand underneath was turned up, so it no longer leaked water. Sufficient manure was also applied, and this year it can yield at least 500 jin. He knew the detailed history of every piece of land.
    The rational close planting of wheat in this village was discussed by the old farmer advisory committee. The roots and stalks are strong, and there is no lodging. The ears are large, and the grains are full. We found a few relatively large ears by the ditch and counted them. Some had more than eighty grains, and some had more than sixty grains. Xing Zhengang has a democratic work style. Important matters, in addition to going through Party members and Communist Youth League members, are constantly discussed in mass meetings based on the former poor and lower-middle peasants. He also always likes to consult with old farmers about production matters. He believes in the advanced scientific summaries from other places. He also believes in the years of practical experience of the local old farmers. He encourages the experienced old farmers to adopt a learning attitude towards scientific experience from other places. The old farmers immediately raised problems they discovered for him to consider.
    Before entering the village, I felt that the pig-raising sideline industry in this village must be developed. Because the manure accumulated at the head of the wheat fields looked like rows of hills. Entering the village, I saw that every household had a pen and pigs. Some of the big pigs were plump and round, weighing more than two hundred jin. Some of the sows were lying on the pigpen sunning platforms, letting the piglets nurse. This village averages one and a half pigs per household, and the yam leaves for feeding the pigs can last until the end of the year. Comrade Xing Zhengang also led me to visit the manure picked up and the pigs raised by five eighty-year-old men. The production team did not assign them production tasks; they did it voluntarily. Because they were all from poor and hired peasant backgrounds, they were living a happy life in their old age and felt that contributing a little to the new socialist China was a supreme joy. Xing Laoxia, whose three sons are all officers in the People's Liberation Army, always brings a basket of manure at dawn and spends the whole day pulling wild vegetables to feed the pigs. Old Han Ping Laoci, eighty-four years old, because he is old and hunched over, can't pick up manure and feed pigs, so he spends the whole day holding a pole and coaxing chickens on the edge of the village. He feels sorry for a single grain of the commune's food being wasted by the chickens.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, some comrades have liked to use the number of bicycles and radios purchased to illustrate the improvement in the living standards of peasants after the Great Leap Forward in rural areas. But Zhongsong Village does not have a single radio. And I found that when the branch committee members went to Anguo County, thirty-five li away, to attend tax collection meetings, they also walked. I asked him why he didn't ride a bicycle. The branch secretary replied, "We always walk when we go to meetings anywhere." I was surprised and said, "It's okay to walk to the commune for meetings. How can you always walk back and forth to the county town for meetings?" A branch committee member standing on the side smiled and said, "What's the big deal? In the spring, the branch secretary took his eldest son to Baoding to see a doctor, and they walked there and back!" I couldn't help but be even more surprised. Baoding is 150 li away from Zhongsong Village, and there is a bus station nearby, and the fare is only a little over two yuan; besides, since the child is sick, it is even more necessary to take a bus! So I couldn't help but say:
   "Since the child is sick, why be stingy with that one or two yuan for the bus fare?" Comrade Xing Zhengang smiled and replied, "Fatigue doesn't cause illness. Before dawn, the two of us had walked forty li, and we arrived before dark. What does a hundred or eighty li matter? When I was a kid, I followed my dad as a porter for others, and we had to carry several hundred jin forty li before dawn. Not to mention now that we're empty-handed! When we were fighting the Japanese in guerilla warfare, didn't we walk a hundred or eighty li in one night; Li Ku, from our village, joined the army at that time when he was only fourteen years old, a year younger than my child!" Judging from Comrade Xing Zhengang's current living conditions and the work he is doing, I do not completely agree with his thrifty practices. But I feel that the spiritual value of his style cannot be measured by material savings. Therefore, under his influence, all the members of Zhongsong Village have developed a spirit of hard work and solid work. They, this "poor village," dug five machine wells and purchased three boiler-camel machines last year alone. If they weren't hard-working, how could they have had such a big production construction! But their total office expenses for the whole year of 1958 were only thirteen yuan. Cadres have never spent a penny when going to the county or commune for meetings. In the autumn of 1958, many villages "had high yields but no harvests." After Zhongsong Village sent its young and middle-aged labor force to the steel and water conservancy fronts, it used the labor force of the elderly and women not only to harvest and thresh all the grain and grass in the village, but also to organize the old men and women to pick up more than 38,000 jin of broken yam slices and 350,000 jin of rough firewood, and 34,000 jin of fodder in the fields of neighboring villages. What is a heroic spirit? I think this is it!
    The cadres of Zhongsong Village are so frugal with themselves, but they are particularly concerned about the family members of soldiers and martyrs. The second time I went to this village, I met someone from Northwest Ma Village who came to collect grain for a martyr's family member. The martyr was a political instructor in the Qingfengdian Campaign, and his old mother lived alone with her daughter in Northwest Ma Village. The person who came to collect the grain for the martyr's family member was the martyr's brother-in-law. During lunch, he voluntarily said to me, "The cadres in this village are really good. Every month I come to collect grain, I see that they eat very frugally in their own canteen, but the grain given to the martyr's family member is all good grain." So I asked in detail. He said, "They guarantee to give five jin of white flour, five jin of mixed flour, ten jin of corn flour, and ten jin of millet every month. There has never been a lower standard than this. They sent five jin of pork for the Spring Festival, and there is also pocket money every month." That day, I saw with my own eyes this person carrying away ten jin of white flour and twenty jin of corn flour. This is not just a material care issue; it contains deep class feelings. I believe it is precisely this feeling that has enabled "Our Branch Secretary" to victoriously lead the Great Leap Forward in Zhongsong Village.

### “我们的支部书记”

    “我们的支部书记”王林
    一个村（生产队）的党支部书记，就是一个村的社会主义标兵。他的一举一动都会影响全村的精神状态和物质生活。安国县伍仁桥人民公社中送村的党支书邢振纲在这一方面给我的印象，再鲜明不过了。
    中送村过去是个有名的穷村子，一百一十七户，有土地八百零九亩。土地改革以前，70％的土地操纵在几家地主富农的手里。长年有七十多户依靠外出打短工、当长工、讨饭和租种地主家的土地维持生活。土地改革和高级合作化以后，群众生活有所提高，但是由于当时的党支部被富农分子操纵着，对于勤俭办社、由穷村变富村毫无信心，只是向国家伸手要贷款，要救济粮，因此一直到1957年，平均每年都要由国家供给食粮七万斤。邢振纲虽然从1939年一开辟工作就当村农会主任，也坚持过最残酷的抗日斗争，却一直被富农出身的党员所排挤。1957年夏，他担任了党支书，彻底肃清了富农分子对党团员、对全村群众的腐蚀，接着，在1958年响应了党中央大跃进的英明号召，实行打机井、机械灌溉、平整土地、园田化等等措施，才使得这个村很快就由穷变富。丰收的第一年（1958年）就向国家缴公粮、卖余粮十二万七千斤。今年麦收后又要卖给国家十五万斤小麦。这个变化何等惊人！因此这里村的人，不论是七、八十岁的老头老婆，或是十来岁的小学生，一提邢振纲都亲切地称呼他：“我们的支部书记”。
    我第一次往中送村去，没进村就看见邢振纲同志正拿着喷雾器在教两个小姑娘给棉花幼苗打药治蚜虫。他见我朝他一直走去，把喷雾器交给小姑娘，也朝我走来。他有五十多岁，个头虽然不高，可是非常健壮。宽大的脑门，精明的两只眼睛，腮帮子塌着，显得胡子楂很突出，精力充沛，满脸凝聚着自信和坚定的神情。
    我把介绍信交给他看了以后，他要我进村坐一坐。我愿意跟着他在地里转。于是我们就在园田化了的麦田中间转游起来。遇见了问题，他就随地处理。有了空隙，他就向我介绍情况。全村有八顷多地，去年秋天种了七顷多麦子，到处都是金光闪闪的麦田。麦田中间有一块种着多穗高粱的园田地，一个个长方形苗畦像碧绿的花格布，他却说大跃进以前这是片高低不平的坟岗地。又有一块地的小麦长的又高又平，麦穗大的像蒜辫子，他说原来这是一块漏地，“三定”的时候每亩定产六十斤，本主都不肯接受；去年深翻地，把下边的一层流沙翻了上来，不再漏水了，又施足了粪，今年至少可以收打五百斤。每一块土地，他都知道它的详细历史。
    这村的小麦合理密植是经过老农顾问会讨论过的。根株壮，没有倒伏。穗子大，籽粒灌的饱满。我们在垅沟边上找了几个比较大的穗子数了数，有的八十多粒，有的六十多粒。邢振纲富有民主作风，重要的事情，除了通过党团员而外，还不断以过去的贫雇农为基础召开群众会议。生产上的事也总爱找老农们研究。他相信别处的先进科学总结。他也相信本地老农民的多年切身体会。他带动得有丰富经验的老农们对外地的科学经验抱着学习态度。老农们发现了问题也立刻提出来请他考虑。
    没有进村，我就感到这个村子的养猪副业一定发达。因为在麦田地头上，堆积的圈肥像一道一道的丘陵。进了村，果然看到家家有圈有猪、有的大猪肥的滚圆，已经有二百多斤了。有的母猪倒在猪圈晒台上正让猪崽们吃奶。这个村平均每户一头半猪，喂猪的山药叶子可以吃到年底。邢振纲同志又领着我参观了五位八旬老头拾的粪和喂养的猪。生产队并没有分配他们生产任务，那是他们自动干的活。因为他们都是贫雇农出身，年老了过着幸福的生活，觉得为社会主义新中国贡献一点力量是无上的快乐。有三个儿子都在解放军里当军官的邢老霞，总是天明一筐粪，还成天拔野菜喂猪。八十四岁的老汉平老慈因为又年老又驼背，拾粪喂猪干不了啦，就成天拿着根竿子在村边地头上哄鸡。叫鸡糟塌一粒公社的粮食，他都心疼。
    大跃进以来，有的同志很喜欢用购买自行车和收音机的数目字，来说明农村大跃进后农民生活水平的提高。可是中送村却没有一台收音机。而且我发现他们村的支部委员往三十五里地以外的安国县城去开征收会议时，也是走着去的。我问他为什么不骑自行车。支部书记回答说：“我们到哪里去开会也是走着去，走着回来。”我吃惊地说：“往公社去开会，走着还可以。到县城里去开会，来回老走着怎么行？”站在一边的一个支部委员笑一笑说：“那有什么，支书春天带着大儿子上保定去治病，还是走着去、走着回来的呢！”我不能不更吃惊了，保定离中送村有一百五十里地，附近又有公共汽车站，票价才二元多；再说既是孩子有病，那更需要坐车去！于是我禁不住说：
  “孩子既然有病，还心痛那一两块钱的车钱干甚么？”邢振纲同志笑笑回答我说：“累不病。天不明，我们爷儿俩就走出了四十里，不等天黑就赶到了。这百八十里算了什么。我小的时候，跟我爹给人家赶脚，好几百斤还天明四十里呢，更不用说这会儿空着手啦！抗日的时候打游击，一晚上还不是走百八十里地；俺村的立库那时参军才十四岁，比俺孩子还小一岁呢！”从邢振纲同志现今的生活条件和担任的工作来看，我并不完全同意他那般刻苦的做法。可是我觉得他那种作风的精神价值，却是不能用物质上的节约来衡量的。因此在他的影响下，中送村全体社员养成一种苦干实干的风气。他们这个“穷村”，去年一年就凿了五眼机井、置备三台锅驼机，要是不刻苦，怎么能有这么大的生产建设！可是他们1958年全年的办公开支才十三元。干部们到县城、到公社开会没有开支过一分一文。1958年秋有不少的村子“丰产不丰收”。中送村把青壮年劳力送上钢铁和水利战线以后，利用老年和妇女劳力不仅把本村的粮草收净打净，而且组织老头老婆到邻村地里拾了三万八千多斤的碎山药片、毛柴三十五万斤，饲料三万四千斤。什么是豪迈的英雄气概呢？我认为这就是！
    中送村的干部对自己这般刻苦，对军烈属却特别关心。我第二次去这个村时，遇见西北马村一个人来领烈属粮。烈士是清风店战役中的指导员，老母一人住在西北马村的女儿家。来领烈属粮的人是烈士的姐夫。吃午饭的时候，他自动地向我说：“这个村的干部真好，我每月来领粮，都见他们自己的食堂吃的很节约，可是给的烈属粮，都是好粮食。”于是我就详细问了起来。他说：“每月保证给五斤白面、五斤杂面、十斤玉米面、十斤小米。没有比这个标准更次过。春节给送去了五斤猪肉，每月还有零花钱。”这一天，我亲眼看见了这个人背走了十斤白面，二十斤玉米面。这不仅仅是个物质照顾问题，这里面包含着深厚的阶级感情。我相信也正是这种感情，使“我们的支部书记”胜利地领导了中送村的大跃进。
