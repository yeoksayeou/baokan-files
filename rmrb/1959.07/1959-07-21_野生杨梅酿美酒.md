    Wild Yangmei Brews Fine Wine
    The experience of the Da Maoshan Reclamation Farm in Jiangxi Province in using wild yangmei to brew wine has recently been praised by the representatives attending the province's fruit wine production symposium.
    Da Maoshan is located in northeastern Jiangxi. At the end of 1957, cadres from provincial-level institutions in Jiangxi, who had been sent to work at lower levels, built a yangmei winery using local methods. So far, this factory has produced 360,000 jin of yangmei wine. The factory also extracts 4% brandy from wild yangmei residue and squeezes 10% oil from yangmei kernels.

    野生杨梅酿美酒
    江西省大茅山垦殖场利用野杨梅酿酒的经验，最近得到了参加这个省果酒生产座谈会的代表们的赞扬。
    大茅山位于江西东北部。1957年年底，江西省级机关的下放干部用土法建成了一座杨梅酿酒厂。到现在这个厂已生产了三十六万斤杨梅酒。这个厂还从野生杨梅渣中提炼出4％的白兰地酒，从杨梅核中榨出10％的油。
