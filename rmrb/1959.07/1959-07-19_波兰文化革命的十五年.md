    Fifteen Years of the Polish Cultural Revolution
    Tadeusz Galinski, Minister of Culture and Art of the Polish People's Republic

    On July 22 this year, the Polish people will celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Polish People's Republic. These fifteen years have marked tremendous changes in the economic and social relations of the Polish people, and significant achievements in the establishment of the socialist system. In the process of socialist transformation, the development of culture and education occupies an important position.

    Looking back at the early years of People's Poland, we see a deplorable cultural and educational legacy ravaged by war, left behind by the bourgeoisie, backward and a tragic scene caused by nearly five years of Nazi occupation.

    After the end of the cruel war, the Polish people yearned for the development of literature, music, and drama. In addition, the unprecedented scale of migration and the subsequent settlement of the Polish people in the west, the reunion of families torn apart by the war, and the concentration of millions of people from rural areas to cities due to the reconstruction and expansion of industry, made millions of people urgently in need of spiritual food. These people had little access to cultural education not only under Nazi occupation but even under bourgeois rule.

    The tremendous efforts made by the People's Government in developing cultural undertakings and the huge appropriations devoted to them soon brought remarkable results. We only cite the following facts: the number of people studying in various schools has doubled compared with the pre-war period, and more than four times as many young people are currently studying in secondary or vocational schools. In the fourteen years of the people's regime, a total of 215,000 people have graduated from universities or specialized schools, while in the twenty years of past bourgeois rule, only 85,000 people received diplomas.

    What about other aspects of cultural undertakings? Let's take radio as an example. The number of people owning radios has increased to nearly five times that of 1938. In 1958, there was one radio for every seven residents in Poland. Before the war, there were no fixed cinemas in the Polish countryside, and farmers almost never saw a movie. Now, 30% of rural areas can see movies in fixed or mobile cinemas.

    Tremendous development has also been achieved in publishing. The number of books and pamphlets printed has almost tripled compared with the pre-war period, and almost quadrupled per capita. In People's Poland, everyone can have access to books, and the number of urban and rural library networks has greatly increased. Before the war, the total number of books in all libraries was 6.5 million. In 1957, the number of books in our public schools, trade unions, and scientific libraries had reached 91 million.

    In the fifteen years of the people's regime, we have done a lot of work in arousing people's love of culture and aesthetics and in familiarizing them with the great and progressive historical traditions of Polish and world culture. We have published millions of copies of works by great Polish and foreign writers. A total of 8,816,600 copies of Henryk Sienkiewicz's works have been printed in Poland, 8,544,400 copies of Bolesław Prus's works, 7,149,000 copies of Kraszewski's novels, 2,020,000 copies of Gorky's works, 1,464,400 copies of Tolstoy's works, 1,359,000 copies of Hugo's works, and 1,007,000 copies of Sholokhov's works.

    An important aspect of cultural activities in People's Poland is the exchange of cultural information with foreign countries and the widespread promotion of the cultural achievements of other countries. It should be mentioned here that until 1939, in fact until 1945, our people and Soviet culture were mutually isolated. Only since the establishment of the People's Government have our people begun to become familiar with Soviet films, dramas, and folk creations. In the past fifteen years, Soviet culture has long been well-known and highly valued in Poland.

    Because we deeply understand the important significance of cultural exchange in mutual understanding between countries, promoting friendship, and strengthening the cause of world peace, People's Poland maintains various cultural ties with different countries. It should be mentioned first of all that Poland has signed cultural cooperation agreements with all countries in the socialist camp, and also has cultural ties with twenty-seven other countries. Through the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Poland is cooperating with forty international cultural organizations.

    In measuring our cultural achievements over the past fourteen or fifteen years, it must be emphasized that the Polish United Workers' Party—the leading force of People's Poland—has from the beginning encouraged artists and writers to develop socialist literature and art and strengthen their ties with the working people. All our cultural achievements are closely linked to the socialist revolution and socialist construction that are taking place in Poland.

    During the period we are reviewing, People's Poland has produced many valuable mass literary and artistic works. For example, Kruczkowski's "The Germans," Nałkowska's "Medallions," Rudnicki's "Old and New Affairs," Niewerly's "A Textile Worker's Memoirs," Brandys's "Citizens," etc. Some well-known films also deal with important moral and ideological issues, such as "The Last Stage," "Border Street," and "Five Boys from Barska Street." The following artists have achieved great achievements: Kowalski, Pronaszko, Dunikowski, and Kulisiwicz, as well as some composers such as Malawski and Lutosławski, etc.

    In the great process of social culture moving towards the socialist road, in addition to the above-mentioned obviously recognized outstanding achievements, unfortunately some deviations have also occurred.

    During the large-scale elimination of illiteracy, the inevitable over-concentration of cultural and educational management work to a certain extent, as well as the general lack of attention in cultural and educational aspects, formed the source of later bureaucratic tendencies in popularizing culture and certain empty talk in artistic issues.

    The revolutionary resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the 8th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party corrected dogmatic and sectarian errors, which is of great significance to the entire social life, including culture and its further development. All this laid the ideological foundation for the Party's new policy on culture. This policy guarantees artists all possibilities for development, economic support from the state, and freedom of artistic practice. Leading the masses in socialist construction and embodying the wishes and needs of the masses, the Party uses ideological weapons to strive for socialist art, for literature that can be accepted and understood by the working people, and for visual arts, music, and drama that are close to them.

    The Party's leading role in culture lies in its encouragement of the spiritual and social content of literary and artistic works, while ensuring the widespread dissemination of cultural wealth that helps to raise the socialist consciousness of the masses, broaden their cultural horizons, and eliminate superstition, ignorance, and remnants of clerical ideology.

    The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party once again clearly reiterated that the Party supports and approves the widest dissemination of literary and artistic works with socialist ideological content and caring for the fate of the world and mankind. The Party also supports all progressive creations that can broaden people's spiritual world, conform to their moral outlook and aesthetic sense, and be used to meet people's other needs, such as rest, entertainment, and recreation.

    The shift in the Party's cultural policy at the Eighth Plenary Session did not immediately bring about positive results, nor was it immediately understood correctly and without error by people. Whenever people encountered the activities of hidden enemies who had tried to paralyze the situation in the past in order to openly oppose socialism, they often showed a feeling of powerlessness.

    The Party resolutely fought against those harmful tendencies without retreating on the general principles of the rich new cultural policy.

    Other aspects of the Party's cultural policy include supporting large-scale social and cultural activities while decentralizing power in the process of leading cultural popularization. At present, the People's Committees have become the real leaders of people's cultural activities in various regions, including the leadership of vocational centers and the entire cultural facility network. As a result, some activities have been authorized to those proactive initiatives from society that can be widely adopted. Let us give some examples of social initiatives. Many clubs and other cultural facilities were established out of voluntary donations. The work of cultural palaces and clubs managed by local committees and social organizations has improved significantly. Many regions are establishing local museums, developing national art and literature, and starting to publish local cultural journals. Cultural centers that are urgently needed in many parts of Poland, especially in the western regions, have been established. All these activities have contributed to the main task put forward by the Party at the Cultural and Educational Conference held in December 1958: "Poland is a country where all the people are engaged in learning." The practical completion of this task first of all means the close connection between cultural and educational work. This is a new stage in the development of our cultural revolution.

    The development of our cultural undertakings and the continuous advancement of industrialization have spontaneously made people thirst for knowledge. Therefore, we immediately began to develop such forms of popularizing knowledge, such as mass universities and the restoration of broadcast universities that had been organized a few years ago, etc. A reflection of these new requirements is a concrete movement initiated by the working people—"Building a Thousand Schools to Commemorate the Millennium of Polish Statehood."

    The development of cultural and educational undertakings will certainly not only rely on social efforts, although this activity is originally related to the fundamental issues of cultural activities. The state has paid huge appropriations for cultural undertakings. The development plan of the Polish People's Republic stipulates that cultural facilities will be further greatly built in 1959-1965. By 1965, the number of clubs and cultural palaces will increase to 200. New theaters and museums will be put into use. 80% of households in Poland will have radios, and the number of television sets will increase from 200,000 in 1959 to 1.5 million in 1965. 57% of the regions and 75% of the residents will be included in the television broadcasting network. Public libraries will have more than 19 million books, and more than 95 million copies of various books will be published in 1965.

    We look forward to the future with confidence, believing that the Polish cultural undertakings encouraged and led by the Polish United Workers' Party will contribute to the interests of the people, to the interests of socialism, and to peace and friendship among all nations.

    波兰文化革命的十五年
    波兰人民共和国文化艺术部长　塔杜什·加林斯基
    今年7月22日，波兰人民将庆祝波兰人民共和国的国庆十五周年。这十五年，标志着波兰人民在经济和社会关系上的巨大变化，标志着在建立社会主义制度方面所取得的重大成就。在社会主义转变的过程中，文化和教育事业的发展占有着重要的地位。
    在回顾人民波兰诞生的最初几年时，我们就会看到一幅由于战争破坏、资产阶级留下来的破烂、落后的可悲的文教遗产，以及将近五年由于纳粹占领的结果所造成的悲惨景象。
    残酷的战争时期结束后，波兰人民渴望文学、音乐和戏剧的发展。此外，空前规模的移民以及随后波兰人民在西部的定居，被战争拆散了的家庭的重新团聚，由于工业的重建、扩建而造成的几百万人口从农村向城市的集中，使得数百万人迫切需要精神食粮。这些人不但在纳粹占领下，即使在资产阶级统治下也是很难有接触文化教育的机会的。
    人民政府在发展文化事业方面所作出的巨大努力和为此而付出的巨额拨款，不久便带来了显著的成果。我们只举出下列的一些事实：现在在各种学校里学习的人数比战前增长了一倍，目前有四倍多的青年在中等学校或职业学校里学习，在人民政权的十四年里，共有二十一万五千人从大学或专科学校毕业，而在过去资产阶级统治的二十年里，才只有八万五千人得到了毕业证书。
    在文化事业的其他方面怎样呢？让我们以收音机为例。现在拥有收音机的人数与1938年比较增加到将近五倍。1958年，波兰每七个居民中就有一架收音机。战前，波兰的农村里没有固定的电影院，农民们几乎从来没有看过一场电影，现在30％的农村能在固定的或流动的电影院里看到电影。
    在出版事业方面也取得了巨大的发展。书本和小册子的印刷数量几乎增长到战前的三倍，如按人口平均计算几乎增长到四倍。在人民波兰，每个人手里都可分到书籍，城乡图书馆网的数目有了很大的增长。战前，所有图书馆中的藏书数目共为六百五十万册，1957年我们在公立学校、工会和科学图书馆中的藏书数目已达到九千一百万册。
    在人民政权的十五年里，我们在唤起人们喜爱文化和审美以及在使人们熟悉伟大、进步的波兰和世界文化历史传统方面，作了许多工作。我们出版了成百万册伟大的波兰和外国作家的作品。亨利·显克微支的作品在波兰共印行了八百八十一万六千册，贝鲁斯劳·普鲁斯的作品印行了八百五十四万四千册，克拉切夫斯基的小说印行了七百一十四万九千册，高尔基的作品印行了二百零二万册，托尔斯泰的作品印行了一百四十六万四千册，雨果的作品印行了一百三十五万九千册，萧洛霍夫的作品印行了一百万零七千册。
    人民波兰文化活动中的一个重要方面是，同外国交换文化情报以及广泛宣传其他国家人民的文化成就。这里应当提到的是，直到1939年，事实上是直到1945年，我国人民和苏维埃文化还是相互隔绝的。只在人民政府成立以来，我国人民才开始熟悉了苏联的电影、戏剧和民间创作。在过去的十五年里，苏维埃文化在波兰早已变得家喻户晓、并受到很高的评价。
    由于我们深刻地体会到文化交流在国家相互间的了解，促进友谊和加强世界和平事业中的重要意义，人民波兰和不同国家间保持着多种的文化联系。首先应当提到的是，波兰同社会主义阵营所有国家签订了文化合作协定，此外还同二十七个国家有着文化上的联系。通过联合国教育、科学及文化组织，波兰同四十个国际文化组织进行着合作。
    在衡量我国过去十四或十五年的文化成就时，必须着重指出，波兰统一工人党——人民波兰的领导力量——从一开始就鼓舞着艺术家和作家发展社会主义的文学艺术，加强他们同劳动人民之间的联系。我们所取得的一切文化成就，是同正在波兰进行着的社会主义革命和社会主义建设紧密联系在一起的。
    在我们所回顾的期间里，人民波兰出现了许多有价值的大众文艺作品。例如：克鲁奇科夫斯基的“德国人”，纳尔科夫斯卡娅的“记功牌”，鲁德尼茨基的“旧事物和新事物”，聂维尔科的“一个纤维工厂工人的回忆录”，勃朗狄斯的“公民们”等等。在一些著名的影片里还涉及到了道德和意识上的重要问题，例如：“最后的阶段”、“边境街市”和“从巴尔斯卡街来的五个孩子”。以下的一些艺术家都获得了重大的成就。例如：柯瓦尔斯基、普隆纳斯科、杜尼科夫斯基和库里西维茨以及一些作曲家如马拉夫斯基和留托斯拉夫斯基等人。
    在社会文化向社会主义道路迈进的伟大过程中，除去以上所说显然是公认的卓越成就外，不幸也出现了一些偏差。
    在大规模扫除文盲期间，在某种程度上不可避免的在文教管理工作上的过分集中现象，以及在文教方面的一般照顾不周，便形成了后来在普及文化上的官僚主义和在有关艺术问题上某些空谈主义不良倾向的源泉。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的革命性决议和波兰统一工人党第八次中央全会纠正了教条主义和宗派主义错误，这对整个社会生活，包括文化和它的进一步发展来说，有着十分重要的意义。这一切为党在文化方面的新政策打下了思想基础。这一政策向艺术家们保证了一切发展的可能、来自国家的经济支援和艺术实践的自由。领导着群众进行社会主义建设，体现着群众的愿望和需要的党，利用思想武器，为社会主义的艺术，为能为劳动人民接受和了解的文学，为接近他们的造型艺术、音乐和戏剧而奋斗。
    党在文化方面的领导作用，在于它鼓舞文学和艺术作品的精神和社会内容，同时保证广泛普及那些有助于提高群众的社会主义觉悟、开阔他们的文化眼界，破除迷信、无知和教权思想残余的文化财富。
    波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会再一次明白地重申：党支持并赞许最广泛地普及那些具有社会主义思想内容，并关怀世界和人类命运的文学艺术作品。党也支持那些能开阔人们的精神世界，符合他们的道德观和美感，以用来满足人们的另外一些需要：如休息、文娱、休养等的一切进步性创作。
    八中全会党在文化政策上的转变，并没有立即带来积极的结果，也没有立即都被人们正确无误地所了解。人们每当遇到那些往日为了公然反对社会主义曾企图使局势瘫痪的暗藏敌人活动时，常常会表现出一种无能为力的心情。
    党对那些有害倾向进行了坚决的斗争，而并没有在内容丰富的新文化政策的总原则上后退。
    党的文化政策的其他一些方面，包含在领导文化普及过程中权力下放的同时，给予大规模社会文化活动的支持。目前，人民委员会已成为各个地区人民文化活动方面的真正领导者，其中包括对职业中心和整个文化设施网的领导。这一结果是，已经给予了那些可被广泛采用的来自社会上的主动倡议以某些活动的权限。我们就社会倡议举些例子。许多俱乐部和其他文化设施是出于自愿捐献而成立起来的。地方委员会和社会组织所管理的文化宫和俱乐部的工作有了显著改进。许多地区正在建立地方博物馆，发展民族文艺，并且开始发行了地方上的文化期刊。波兰许多地方迫切需要的文化中心，特别是在西部地区，已经建立起来。这一切活动都为在1958年12月举行的文化教育会议上党所提出的主要任务作出贡献：“波兰是全体人民在进行着学习的国家。”这一任务的实际完成，首先便意味着文化和教育工作的紧密联系。这是我国文化革命发展中的一个新的阶段。
    我国文化事业的发展和工业化的不断前进，使人们自发地渴求知识。因此我们立即开始发展了那样一些普及知识的形式，例如群众大学以及恢复了几年前所组织过的广播大学等等。这些新要求的一个反映，就是劳动人民发起的一个具体运动——“兴建千所学校，纪念波兰建国千年”。
    文教事业的发展，当然不会只依靠在社会努力的基础上前进，虽然这一活动原是和文化活动的根本问题有关的。国家为文化事业付出了巨额拨款。波兰人民共和国的发展计划中规定，1959—1965年将进一步大力兴建文化设施。到1965年俱乐部和文化宫的数目将增长到二百个。新的戏院和博物馆将交付使用。波兰80％的住户将备有收音机，电视机的数目，将由1959年的二十万台增加到1965年的一百五十万台，57％的地区和75％的居民将包括在电视播送网里。公共图书馆将有图书一千九百多万册，1965年将出版九千五百多万册各种书籍。
    我们满怀信心地展望着未来，相信为波兰统一工人党所鼓舞和领导的波兰文化事业将为人民的利益，为社会主义的利益，为各国人民间的和平和友谊作出贡献。（附图片）
