Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 27th, TASS Moscow, July 26th: N.S. Khrushchev's message on July 25th to the participants of the 7th World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship:

    I warmly congratulate the participants of the 7th World Youth and Students Festival gathering in Vienna. It is a very good thing that young people from different countries with different political beliefs come together to express their ardent desire for peaceful coexistence, friendship, and respect for the traditions of all countries and peoples.

    The youth have already chosen the lofty slogan "For Peace and Friendship!" as the motto for their festival. Differences in social and political systems should not hinder peaceful coexistence between countries, nor should they be an obstacle to friendship and cooperation among young people, sports competitions, and the exchange of cultural achievements between countries. The desire of young people to meet and exchange opinions as much as possible, so as to have a better understanding of each other, should be welcomed and supported as much as possible.

    The scientific and technological achievements of our time, the greatest inventions, should serve constructive purposes rather than destructive ones; they must be used to improve people's lives, not to eliminate people. They can and should bring not only more material benefits but also more spiritual wealth to mankind, especially to you young people.

    Through you, I congratulate the youth of the world, and I wish you success in peaceful and creative study and labor, so as to increase material and spiritual wealth. Decorate the earth with the fruits of your labor and your genius! The future belongs to the younger generation. Good people all hope that the principles of peaceful coexistence will prevail, that mankind will be freed from the threat of war, and that young people will be able to devote all their energy and talents to peaceful endeavors, for the benefit of mankind and for the advancement of mankind.

    I sincerely wish the 7th World Festival, all the participants and representatives of the festival, complete success in achieving the lofty goals you have set for yourselves.

    赫鲁晓夫写信给世界青年联欢节的参加者
    用你们的劳动和天才来装饰大地
    新华社27日讯　塔斯社莫斯科26日讯：尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫7月25日致第七届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节参加者的祝词：
    我热烈祝贺聚首维也纳的第七届世界青年与学生联欢节的参加者。不同政治信念的各国青年聚在一起来表示他们殷切要求和平友好共处、尊重各个国家和人民的传统的愿望，这是一件非常好的事。
    青年们已经选择了“争取和平和友谊！”这个崇高的号召作为他们举行的联欢节的口号。社会和政治制度的不同不应阻碍各国和平共处，也不应成为青年们友谊合作、进行体育比赛、交流各国文化成就的障碍。青年们要求尽可能多地会晤和交换意见，从而使彼此有更好的认识和了解的愿望，应当受到欢迎和尽一切可能的支持。
    我们时代的科学技术成就，最伟大的发明应该为建设性的目的而不是为破坏性的目的服务，它们必须用于改善人们的生活，而不是为了消灭人们。它们能够而且应该为人类，首先是为你们青年人不仅带来更多的物质福利，而且还带来更多的精神财富。
    通过你们，我祝贺世界青年，我祝你们在和平创造性的学习和劳动中获得成就，以便使物质财富和精神财富增长。用你们劳动和你们的天才的果实来装饰大地吧！未来属于青年一代。善良的人们都希望和平共处的原则获得胜利，希望人类摆脱战争的威胁，希望青年能够把自己的全部精力和才能用于和平事业，造福人类和有利于人类的进步。
    我衷心地预祝第七届世界联欢节、联欢节的全体参加者和代表们在达到你们为自己提出的崇高目标方面获得彻底胜利。
