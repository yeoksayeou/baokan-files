Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 11th: The people of Jilin Province, who overcame a major drought last year and reaped a bumper harvest, have once again displayed the same heroic spirit to repel the continuous severe drought and achieved victory in spring plowing and sowing. Since entering July, there has been widespread rainfall throughout the province. Except for Fuyu, Qian'an, and Qian Gorlos Mongolian Autonomous County, which still have drought conditions, the drought in other areas has been relieved. Currently, under the slogan of "Work hard, work diligently, and work skillfully for thirty days; do not put down the hoe until the crops are well tended" put forward by the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, farmers throughout the province are intensifying weeding, topdressing, and rushing to plant late-season crops, striving for a bumper autumn harvest. At the same time, flood prevention preparations have also been launched in various places.

Since June of last year, Jilin Province has been under the threat of drought. In particular, most areas of the central plain, the main grain-producing area, have experienced extremely scarce rain and snow last winter and this spring. Until the end of June this year, there had not been a single soaking rain. The rainfall in this area in May this year was twenty to forty millimeters less than the date when drought conditions began to appear last year; the rainfall in June was also 30% to 40% less than normal years. In addition, due to the increased temperatures last winter and this spring, the amount of soil moisture evaporation in the province was large, and the flow of many rivers decreased by 40% to 50% compared to the same period in previous years. More than half of the rivers basically stopped flowing, and many reservoirs dried up, causing great difficulties for agricultural production throughout the province. However, the people of Jilin Province, who were tempered in the drought resistance struggle last year, were not intimidated by the continuous drought. Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, they began a new anti-drought battle from the start of spring plowing preparations. More than 49.5 million mu of land that had been deep-plowed throughout the province were leveled, harrowed, and compacted early in the winter and spring to conserve water and preserve moisture. Many counties and communes also adopted the method of "fighting a quick battle" to dig wells and springs for spring irrigation. According to statistics at the end of June, since the beginning of this year, the province has newly dug more than 2,000 water wells, more than 1,200 machine wells, more than 11,000 artesian springs, and newly built and renovated more than 1,700 ponds, dams, and reservoirs, with spring irrigation reaching more than 1.65 million mu. After the start of spring sowing, the communes rationally arranged labor and rushed to sow with soil moisture. Many communes put forward the battle cry of "As long as we work harder, we are not afraid of drought; if the seedlings don't emerge the first time, we will replant a second time," and actively rushed to plant. Many communes replanted three or four times in a row, striving for full seedlings. After such arduous struggles, the spring-sown crops in the province were basically sown in a timely manner, and the sowing quality in most areas was relatively good.

At present, the more than 60 million mu of major autumn crops throughout the province, after being processed and fertilized, especially after the rain, are mostly growing well. Sorghum and corn have grown to about two chi (approx. 2/3 meter), wheat has already entered the grouting and grain-filling stage, and soybeans are about to bloom. The more than 2.4 million agricultural workers in the province are taking advantage of the good opportunity after the rain and, under the slogan of "What was lost in the drought, find it back through labor," are vigorously attacking field management and rushing to plant late-season crops. The second weeding is nearing completion throughout the province, and the third weeding has begun. In Dongfeng, Yushu and other counties, where progress is faster, the third weeding has been completed on more than 50% to 70% of the fields, and nearly 50% of the crops have been top-dressed once.

    旱里丢了的　一定找回来
    吉林战胜空前大旱抢种晚秋
    六千多万亩大秋作物大部生长良好
    新华社长春11日电　去年战胜大旱赢得丰收的吉林省人民，今年又以同样的英雄气概，击退了连续发生的严重干旱，取得了春耕播种的胜利。进入7月以来，全省各地已经普降喜雨，除扶余、乾安、前郭尔罗斯蒙古族自治县仍有旱象外，其他地区的旱象已经解除。现在，全省农民在中共吉林省委提出的“大干、苦干、巧干三十天，不侍弄好庄稼不挂锄”的口号下，正在加紧铲趟、追肥和抢种晚田作物，力争秋季丰收。同时，各地的防汛准备工作也已展开。
    从去年6月开始，吉林省一直处在干旱威胁之下，特别是主要产粮区中部平原的大部分地区，去冬今春雨雪奇缺，直到今年6月底都没有下过一次透雨。这个地区今年5月份的降雨量，比去年已经开始出现旱象的日期还少二十到四十毫米；6月份的降雨量也比常年少30％到40％。加上去冬今春气温增高，全省土壤水分蒸发量大，不少河水流量比往年同期减少40％至50％，半数以上的河流基本断流，许多水库干涸，使全省的农业生产遇到了巨大的困难。但是在去年的抗旱斗争中受到锻炼的吉林省人民，没有让连续发生的干旱吓倒，他们在各级党委的领导下，从备耕开始就投入了新的抗旱战斗。全省四千九百五十多万亩经过深翻的土地，都在冬春及早地整平、耙碎、压实，做到了蓄水保墒。许多县和公社还采取“打快拳”的办法，打井、挖泉，进行春灌。据6月底统计，今年以来全省共新打水井二千多眼、机井一千二百多眼，挖自流泉一万一千多眼，新建与整修塘坝、水库一千七百多处，春灌面积达到一百六十五万多亩。春播开始后，各公社又合理安排了劳力，抢墒播种。许多公社提出了“只要加劲干，不怕天气旱，一遍不出，再补二遍”的战斗口号，积极抢种。有不少公社连续补种了三、四次，力争全苗。经过这样的艰苦斗争，全省春播作物基本上做到了适时早种，大部分地区的播种质量也比较好。
    目前，全省六千多万亩大秋作物，经过加工加肥，特别是得雨以后，大部生长良好。高粱、苞米已高达二尺左右，小麦已经灌浆鼓粒，大豆将要扬花。全省二百四十多万农业大军正乘雨后良机，在“旱里丢，工上找”的口号下，猛攻田间管理和抢种晚田作物。全省二遍铲趟将近结束，三遍铲趟已经开始，进度较快的东丰、榆树等县，三遍铲趟已完成50％—70％以上，并有近50％的作物追了一遍肥。
