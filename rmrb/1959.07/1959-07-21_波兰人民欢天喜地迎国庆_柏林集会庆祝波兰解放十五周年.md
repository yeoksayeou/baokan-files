Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 18th (By our reporter Li Ke): On the eve of the upcoming 15th anniversary of Polish National Day on July 22nd, residents of Warsaw, the Polish capital, and other regions are busy cleaning streets, painting walls, and making new clothes to celebrate the holiday in style. Residents of major cities have also adorned their cities with festive decorations. Red and white national flags and colorful flowers flutter in the breeze on the streets.

Various provinces and cities are holding activities to celebrate the 15th anniversary of National Day. In these activities, the Polish people excitedly review the tremendous achievements made in socialist construction over the past fifteen years. In addition, various mass celebration activities have been held across the country. Opol recently held a bonfire party with more than 2,000 children and teenagers participating. In Warsaw, young people will hold a "Youth Festival" from the 19th to the 25th, with performances, sports competitions, and other activities. In Chelm, Lublin Province, where the Polish People's government was proclaimed fifteen years ago, the celebrations are even more lively.

Good news frequently comes from all over the country about the successful completion of gift plans to greet National Day by employees in coal mines, chemical, and light industries. After completing the gift plans, workers in many places have undertaken new gift tasks. Textile workers in Lodz have guaranteed to produce 10,000 more meters of woolen fabrics and 8,000 more meters of tweed fabrics in the five days before National Day. Workers in Zielona Góra Province have guaranteed to build nine playgrounds for children before July 22nd. Workers in Rzeszow actively participated in cleaning streets, parks, and public places before the festival.

The whole country has shown great enthusiasm in welcoming National Day, so many new factories, enterprises, and construction projects will be completed ahead of schedule, adding even more joy to National Day. The Legnica copper smelter and the Witasiowo fiberboard factory in Poznan Province will both be put into operation before National Day, and the Gdansk Shipyard will launch Poland's fifteenth 10,000-ton vessel on the eve of National Day. In Warsaw, the double-layered bridge spanning the Vistula River from east to west will also be completed before the 21st. Before National Day, a number of new homes will be completed in various places.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 19th The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Council of Ministers, and the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany jointly held a celebration meeting here today to commemorate the 15th anniversary of Poland's liberation.

Prime Minister Grotewohl said at the meeting that the German Democratic Republic, together with other countries in the socialist camp, will repel any encroachment on its territory and the peaceful border of the Oder-Neisse line.

Grotewohl said that the relationship between Germany and Poland has undergone fundamental changes since the Second World War. What connects the two countries now is fraternal friendship. In the agreement signed by the governments of the two countries in June 1950, the Oder-Neisse line border was stipulated as an eternal peaceful border. Grotewohl emphasized that the German Democratic Republic will defend this border together with other countries in the socialist camp.

Grotewohl condemned the revanchist activities of West German militarism. He said that the Adenauer group has repeatedly stated that it wants to "liberate the eastern occupied territories" and "re-examine the Oder-Neisse line border"; it attempts to invade the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, and even attempts to "erase the Soviet Union from the map."

Grotewohl emphasized that neither the people of the socialist camp nor all peace-loving forces in the world will be intimidated or deceived by the shameless provocative acts of West German militarism, and Adenauer's policy is doomed to failure.

In his speech, Grotewohl once again, on behalf of the people of the German Democratic Republic and all patriotic forces in West Germany, expressed full support for the proposal of Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

Today's celebration was attended by leaders of the German Democratic Republic party and government, representatives from all walks of life, and diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in the German Democratic Republic. Polish Ambassador Piotrowski also spoke at the meeting.

    波兰人民欢天喜地迎国庆
    柏林集会庆祝波兰解放十五周年
    新华社华沙18日电　本社记者李克报道：在即将于7月22日到来的波兰国庆十五周年的前夕，波兰首都华沙和各地居民正忙着打扫街道，粉刷墙壁，赶制新装，准备漂漂亮亮地过节。各大城市居民也都给自己的城市披上了节日的盛装，街头上，迎风招展的红白色国旗和各色鲜花交相辉映。
    各省市都在举行庆祝十五周年国庆的活动，在这些活动里，波兰人民兴奋地回顾十五年来在社会主义建设中获得的巨大成就。此外，各地还举行了多种多样的群众性庆祝活动，奥波尔最近举行了有两千多少年儿童参加的营火晚会。在华沙市，青年们将从19日到25日举行“青春节”，进行文艺演出、体育比赛等活动。在十五年前波兰人民政权宣布成立的卢布林省的赫尔姆，庆祝活动更为热闹。
    从全国各地频频传来煤矿、化学和轻工业等部门职工胜利完成迎接国庆节献礼计划的捷报。在完成献礼计划后，许多地方的职工又承担了新的献礼任务。罗兹的纺织工人保证要在国庆前五天多生产一万公尺的毛织品和八千公尺的呢绒织品。绿山省的工人保证在7月22日前为孩子们修建九座儿童游艺场。热舒夫的工人在节日前积极参加了街道、公园、公共场所的清洁工作。
    全国各地为了迎接国庆发挥了很大干劲，因而不少新的工厂企业和建筑项目将要提前建成，这更为国庆节喜上添喜。累格尼察的炼铜厂和波兹南省维塔希奥纤维板工厂都将在国庆前投入生产，革但斯克造船厂要在国庆前夕使波兰第十五条万吨轮船下水。在华沙，维斯杜拉河上横贯东西的双层大桥，也要在21日前完工。国庆节前，各地还有一批新住宅建成。
    新华社柏林19日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会，部长会议和民主德国全国阵线全国委员会今天在这里联合举行庆祝大会，纪念波兰解放十五周年。
    格罗提渥总理在会上说，德意志民主共和国将同社会主义阵营其他国家一道，击退对它的领土和奥得—尼斯河和平边界的任何进犯。
    格罗提渥说，在第二次世界大战后，德波两国的关系发生了根本的变化。现在把两国连结起来的是兄弟般的友好关系。在1950年6月两国政府签订的协议中，把奥得—尼斯河边界规定为永恒的和平边界。格罗提渥强调说，德意志民主共和国将和社会主义阵营其他国家一道保卫这个边界。
    格罗提渥谴责西德军国主义的复仇活动。他说，阿登纳集团多次表示要“解放东方占领区”、“重新审查奥得—尼斯河边界”；企图侵略德意志民主共和国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克，甚至妄图“把苏联从地图上消灭”。
    格罗提渥强调说，无论社会主义阵营各国人民，还是世界上一切爱好和平的力量，都不会被西德军国主义的无耻挑衅行为所吓倒或迷惑，阿登纳的政策注定是要失败的。
    格罗提渥在讲话中再一次代表德意志民主共和国人民和西德一切爱国力量表示充分支持波兰外交部长腊帕茨基关于建立中欧无原子武器区的建议。
    今天参加庆祝会的有德意志民主共和国党和政府的领导人、各界人士代表以及各国驻德意志民主共和国的外交使节。波兰大使皮奥特罗夫斯基也在会上讲了话。
