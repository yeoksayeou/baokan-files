Greek Reactionary Authorities, Stop!
	Guo Xiaochuan

The eyes of people all over the world are focused on that ancient country beside the Aegean Sea—Greece and its capital—Athens. For generations, this country and its capital have been known to the world for their long and delightful culture. Unfortunately, the current Greek reactionary authorities have aroused universal indignation with their shocking acts of violence that violate reason and justice.

As everyone knows, this shocking act of violence is the trial of Greek national hero Glezos and other patriots. The charges leveled against Glezos by the Greek reactionary authorities are absurd. The Greek military court's trial of Glezos is unreasonable. Look at how ridiculous this is! Sitting in the dock is the outstanding peace fighter, the representative of Greek progressive culture, and national hero Glezos, who personally tore down the fascist swastika flag and raised the flag of the Greek nation, while the public enemy, American imperialists, stand behind the judges like supreme emperors.

Of course, only a small handful of reactionary rulers in Greece have tarnished the historical glory of Greece. The fact is that the working people and patriots of all classes in Greece stand on Glezos' side. Because everyone knows that the persecution of Glezos and other patriots is a warning sign of a vicious attack on the democratic rights of the Greek people and the progressive forces of Greece. The national interests of the entire Greece and its loyal defender, Glezos, are facing serious threats together. The Greek people will never bow to barbarism. They raise their voices of resistance with high spirits. The flag of freedom that Glezos once raised is flying high in the squares of Greece, in the wilderness, and in all places where there are people. ...

The heroic actions of the Greek people have won the respect of people all over the world. All people who love peace and uphold justice cannot help but take action and express their solemn protests to the Greek reactionary authorities. There is an old Chinese saying: "He who has the Tao receives much help; he who loses the Tao receives little help." This is a perfect portrayal of the current globally watched event.

However, until today, the Greek reactionary authorities have not stopped.

As of July 13, the situation has reached this point: the Greek reactionary authorities' conspiracy of framing has been exposed, the mask of the military court has been torn off, and the "evidence" of the fake "witnesses" has not even a shadow of truth. However, the Greek reactionary authorities seem to have tied their necks to the American war chariot and are determined to walk into the abyss of sin.

Is this permissible? No, it is not. We must resolutely stop this atrocity. In order to safeguard peace and human dignity, we must protest to the Greek reactionary authorities again and again! The trial of Glezos and other patriots must be stopped immediately! Glezos must be released immediately and given freedom!

Greek reactionary authorities, stop!

    希腊反动当局，止步！
    郭小川
    全世界人民的目光，都在注视着爱琴海旁边的那个古老的国家——希腊和她的首都——雅典。这个国家和她的首都在多少世代以来一直以悠久的、令人欣喜的文化闻名于世。不幸的是，现在的希腊反动当局，却以骇人听闻的、违反理智和正义的暴行，引起了举世的公愤。
    众所周知，这个骇人听闻的暴行，就是对希腊民族英雄格列索斯及其他爱国者的审判。希腊反动当局横加在格列索斯头上的罪名是荒谬绝伦的。希腊军事法庭对格列索斯的审判是毫无道理的。请看这是何等荒唐的事情呵！坐在被告席上的，竟是亲手扯下法西斯卐字旗、升起希腊民族的旗帜的、杰出的和平战士、希腊进步文化的代表、民族英雄格列索斯，而人民公敌美帝国主义者却俨然像太上皇一样站在审判者的背后。
    当然，沾辱了希腊的历史光荣的，只是希腊一小撮反动统治者。事实正是这样，希腊的劳动人民和各阶层的爱国者都站在格列索斯一边。因为人人都知道，对格列索斯及其它爱国者的迫害，就是对希腊人民的民主权利、和希腊的进步力量发动凶恶进攻的警号。整个希腊的民族利益和它的忠实捍卫者格列索斯一起遭受严重的威胁。希腊人民永远也不会向野蛮低头。他们昂扬地喊出自己的反抗的声音。格列索斯所曾升起的自由的旗帜，在希腊的广场上，在旷野中，在一切有人烟的地方高高地飘扬着。……
    希腊人民的英勇行为，赢得了全世界人民的尊敬。所有爱好和平、主持正义的人们，都情不自禁地行动起来，向希腊反动当局表示了庄严的抗议。中国有句古话：“得道者多助，失道者寡助。”正好是目前这个举世注目的事件的写照。
    但是，直到今天，希腊反动当局还不止步。
    到了7月13日止，事情已经到了这样的地步：希腊反动当局的诬陷的阴谋露了马脚，军事法庭的面具被拆穿了，伪“证人”的“证据”连一点真实的影子都没有了。然而，希腊反动当局似乎已经把自己的脖子系在美国的战车上，还要执意向罪恶的深渊中走去。
    这是能够允许的吗？不，不能。我们必须坚决地制止这种暴行。为了维护和平和人类的尊严，我们要一次又一次地向希腊反动当局抗议！必须立即停止对格列索斯及其他爱国者的审判！必须立即释放格列索斯，给格列索斯以自由！
    希腊反动当局，止步！
