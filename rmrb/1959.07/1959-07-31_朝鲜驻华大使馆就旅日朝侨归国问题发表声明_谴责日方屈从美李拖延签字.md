Xinhua News Agency, 30th – At a press conference held today, Tae Ho, Second Secretary of the Korean Embassy in China, on behalf of Ambassador Lee Young-ho, issued a statement strongly condemning the Japanese side for yielding to the pressure of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang and delaying the signing of the agreement reached between North Korea and Japan on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan. The statement emphasized that this Japanese action is an attempt to use the issue of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan as an insidious political transaction.

The statement pointed out: As early as a month ago, the delegations of the Red Cross Societies of North Korea and Japan reached a complete agreement on the issue of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan. However, the Japanese side adopted an improper stance, saying that the agreement must first obtain the consent of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and therefore refused to sign the agreement immediately. The statement said: "The issue of signing the agreement between North Korea and Japan and the issue between the Japanese side and the International Committee of the Red Cross are two completely different issues, and it is not permissible to artificially entangle them together. The Japanese side has been unreasonably insisting on this improper claim, attempting to use the issue of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan as an insidious political transaction."

The statement further said: "The Japanese side is yielding to the pressure of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang, and at the same time, taking advantage of the current delay in signing, is attempting to re-hold North Korea-Japan talks with the Syngman Rhee gang."

The statement strongly condemned US imperialism for encouraging and instigating the Syngman Rhee gang to clamor wildly against the realization of the repatriation wishes of Korean residents in Japan, while also rudely exerting pressure on the Japanese authorities, conspiring to sabotage and prevent the repatriation work of Korean residents in Japan from proceeding.

The statement concluded: The people of North Korea and Japan and all well-intentioned people in the world are closely watching the attitude of the Nobusuke Kishi government. If the Japanese side is truly willing to have Korean residents in Japan return to their country, it should abandon its improper claims and sign the agreement that has already been reached, so that Korean residents in Japan can "return to their glorious motherland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as soon as possible."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th – According to Pyongyang newspapers today: Lee Il-kyung, head of the North Korean Red Cross delegation, again sent a telegram to Kasai Kazuji, head of the Japanese Red Cross delegation, on the 29th, urging the Japanese side to show sincerity on the issue of sending Korean residents in Japan back to their country, and requesting the Japanese side to agree that the two sides should immediately sign the agreement already reached by the delegations of both sides in Geneva.

    朝鲜驻华大使馆就旅日朝侨归国问题发表声明
    谴责日方屈从美李拖延签字
    新华社30日讯　朝鲜驻华大使馆二等秘书太虎代表李永镐大使在今天举行的中外记者招待会上发表声明，严厉谴责日本方面屈服于美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的压力，拖延在朝日双方就旅日朝侨归国问题达成的协议上签字。声明强调指示，日方这种作法是企图把旅日朝鲜侨民的归国问题当做阴险的政治交易。
    声明指出：早在一个月以前，朝鲜和日本两国红十字会代表团就关于旅日朝鲜侨民归国问题达成了完全的协议，可是日本方面采取不正当的立场，说什么协议必须先取得红十字国际委员会的同意，因此拒绝立即在协议上签字。声明说：“朝日双方在协议上签署的问题，日方同红十字国际委员会之间的问题，是两个完全不同的问题，不容人为地纠缠在一起。日方一直毫无道理地坚持这种不正当的主张，企图把旅日朝侨的归国问题当做阴险的政治交易。”
    声明进一步说：“日方屈服于美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的压力，同时利用目前拖延签署的时机，企图与李承晚匪帮重新举行朝日会谈。”
    声明强烈谴责美帝国主义鼓励和指使李承晚匪帮疯狂叫嚣，反对旅日朝侨实现归国愿望，同时向日本当局粗暴地施加压力，阴谋进行破坏，使旅日朝侨归国的工作无法进行。
    声明最后说：朝日两国人民和全世界善良的人民都在密切注视着岸信介政府的态度，如果日方真正愿意旅日朝侨回国，就应该取消自己的不正当主张，在已经达成的协议上签字，使旅日朝侨“早日回到自己的光荣祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    据新华社平壤30日电　据平壤报纸今天报道：朝鲜红十字会代表团团长李一卿在29日再次打电报给日本红十字会代表团团长葛西嘉资，要求日本方面在遣送旅日朝侨归国问题上表示诚意，并且要求日本方面同意由双方立即在双方代表团在日内瓦已经达成的协议上签字。
