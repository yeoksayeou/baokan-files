    In the Places the Red Army Passed Through
    By Our Correspondent Zhou Zuyou
    In the famous snowy mountains and grasslands of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army once wrote an immortal page of heroic deeds with their blood and sweat. It was also in this place that they established a firm connection between the Party and the Tibetan people for the first time. The Tibetan people began to understand that only by closely following the Communist Party could they move towards prosperity and happiness.
    Zhuokeji is located near the intersection of snowy mountains and grasslands, and it is where the Red Army passed through during the Long March. From the experience of this ordinary Tibetan village, we deeply feel the flesh-and-blood connection between the Party and the Tibetan people. In the past, Zhuokeji was a poor and backward Tibetan village. Today, it has established a people's commune. The Tibetan people live freely and happily in the spring sunshine.
    Anyone who comes to this village on the Suomo River for the first time will find it hard to believe that a few years ago, it was a desolate place. Now, it has the commune's department store outlet, sewing group, clinic, school, public canteen..., and even a fine arts photography department.
    I ate lunch in the public canteen. There were wheat noodle vegetable steamed buns and fresh cabbage soup. To be honest, I really didn't expect the food to be so delicious. I jokingly asked the township cadre Luo Erre Mucu, what was the food like before liberation? This young woman, who had been a slave to feudal lords for more than twenty years, pursed her lips and replied: "Every meal was bitter buckwheat cake. Even during the New Year, we couldn't eat such good things!"
    Everything here shines with the light of happiness. Who can still find a trace of poverty and suffering?
    However, Zhuokeji did have a past full of blood and tears. More than 170 Tibetan households in nearby villages lived under the cruel rule of feudal lords for generations. They had endless rents to pay and countless corvée labor to perform. How many people suffered from hunger and cold, and how many families were ruined? In June 1935, Chairman Mao led the Red Army here, and the Tibetan people discovered a light in their lives for the first time. With the help of the Red Army, they established township soviets, revolutionary committees, and revolutionary organizations such as self-defense forces and Young Pioneers. Many people also actively served as translators and guides for the Red Army, helping the Red Army raise grain. They enjoyed the right to equality between people for the first time. More than five months later, the Red Army continued north, and the last Red Army team left this place. However, the seeds of revolution were deeply sown. In those dark years, the Tibetan people cherished the copper pots, knives, hats, and copper coins left by the Red Army. They looked forward to the Red Army returning, and looked forward to the final liberation.
    This day finally came. The People's Liberation Army liberated this deeply suffering place. In the official residence where Chairman Mao once lived, district and township people's governments were established. After the democratic reforms in 1956, the Tibetan people were completely liberated. They organized mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives. Last year, they established people's communes. More than 170 Tibetan households have since embarked on the road to happiness and prosperity forever. Last year, the yield of grain here reached 330 jin per mu. This is several times more than before liberation. In the villages where two-thirds of the households lacked food before liberation, no one is worried about eating anymore.
    Duo Xisitou, 56 years old, his father and mother were both slaves of feudal lords. In 1935, he understood the root of his poverty from the Red Army and decided to follow the Red Army forever. He publicized it everywhere to the villagers, and actively worked with the Red Army to help them prepare food. However, because his parents fell ill and died, and he contracted a serious illness himself, he stayed in his hometown when the Red Army went north and became a slave of the feudal lord again. How many nights he remembered the days of living with the Red Army, and looked forward to the Red Army returning soon. When Zhuokeji was liberated, this old man even ran to ask, hoping to join the Liberation Army again. Now, Duo Xisitou is living a happy life in the commune. Recently, he and his wife received more than 40 yuan in wages at one time. Duo Xisitou pointed to the felt hat, corduroy clothes, and cowhide Tibetan boots he was wearing, and said with emotion: "How could I have worn such clothes before liberation!" As if summarizing his entire experience, he said to me: "I have lived for more than fifty years, and only under the leadership of the Party have I lived a truly human life."
    In this place, the revolutionary seeds sown by the Red Army twenty-four years ago have sprouted, grown, and blossomed. I saw the children of the Soviet cadres and Red Army soldiers who sacrificed in those years, now taking over the cause of their fathers and brothers, working diligently and hard to serve the Tibetan people. There is a 27-year-old youth named Sidate, whose father joined the Red Army in 1935 and sacrificed during the Long March. His mother suffered all kinds of torture and died in the feudal lord's cowshed. At that time, the young Sidate was lonely with his younger sister, serving as a slave to the feudal lord. They were enslaved in such a way that they didn't look like human beings. The feudal lord even called them "ghost people." After liberation, Sidate finally got rid of the feudal lord's enslavement and joined the work. The Party also sent him to the Ethnic Cadre School to study. During the democratic reforms, he worked tirelessly to mobilize poor peasants. After the reform ended, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China, actively led the farmers to develop mutual aid and cooperation, and took the lead in carrying out reforms in farming technology. Now, Sidate has been elected as the township head, and has been rated as an advanced worker in the county twice. Sidate recalled his past and said to me: "The happiness of our Tibetan people today is all thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao, and all thanks to the millions of martyrs like my father who shed blood and sacrificed. We must take on the tasks they did not complete. No matter what hardships and difficulties there are, we must realize the most beautiful communist ideals in our hands!" (Attached pictures)

    在红军长征经过的地方
    本报记者　周祖佑
    在阿坝藏族自治州著名的雪山草地，中国工农红军曾经用血汗写成了一页永不磨灭的英雄业迹。也是在这个地方，他们使党和藏族人民第一次建立起牢固的联系。藏族人民开始懂得，要走向繁荣和幸福，只有紧紧跟随着共产党。
    卓克基的位置接近雪山、草地的交会处，是当年红军长征经过的地方。从这个普通藏族村寨的经历，我们深切地感受到党和藏族人民血肉相关的联系。过去的卓克基，是一个贫穷落后的藏民小寨子。今天，这里却已经建立了人民公社。藏族人民自由欢乐地生活在春天的阳光里。
    谁要是第一次来到这个梭磨河畔的村镇，一定很难相信，几年前，这里竟是一片荒凉。现在，这里有了公社的百货商店门市部、缝纫组、诊疗所、学校、公共食堂……，甚至还有一个美术摄影部。
    我在公共食堂里吃了一餐午饭。有麦面菜馍和新鲜白菜汤。老实说，我真没想到饭菜会这样鲜美。我开玩笑地问乡干部罗尔热木初，解放前的伙食如何？这个给封建主当了二十多年奴隶的女青年噘噘嘴，回答说：“顿顿苦荞粑，连过年过节，也吃不到这样的好东西！”
    这里的一切，都闪射着幸福的光彩。谁还能发现一点贫穷苦难的痕迹？
    但是，卓克基的确有过充满血泪的往昔。附近沟寨的一百七十多户藏民，祖祖辈辈生活在封建主的残酷统治下。交不尽的租款，当不完的差役，有多少人饥寒交迫、有多少人家破人亡？1935年6月，毛主席领导着红军来到这里，藏民才第一次在生活中发现了光亮。在红军的帮助下，他们成立了乡苏维埃、革命委员会，建立了自卫队、少先队等革命组织。很多人还积极地为红军担任通司（翻译）和响导，帮助红军筹集粮食。他们第一次享受到人与人间平等的权利。五个多月后，红军继续北上，最后一支红军，离开了这个地方。但是，革命种籽却深深播下了。在那黑暗的年月里，藏民们万分珍惜地保存着红军遗下的铜锅、小刀、帽子和铜币。他们盼望红军回来，盼望着最后的解放。
    这一天终于来到了。人民解放军解放了这个苦难深重的地方。在毛主席曾经居住过的官寨里，建立起了区、乡人民政府。经过1956年的民主改革，藏民们得到了彻底的解放。他们组织起互助组、农业社，去年，又建立了人民公社。一百七十多户藏民，从此永远走上了幸福繁荣的大道。去年，这里粮食亩产达到三百三十斤。比解放前增加好几倍，解放前三分之二人家缺粮的村寨，如今再没有人为吃饭发愁了。
    五十六岁的朵西斯头，父、母都是封建主的奴隶。1935年，他从红军那里懂得了自己贫困的根源，决心永远跟着红军走。他到处向乡亲们宣传，还积极地同红军一起劳动，帮助红军筹备粮食。但是，因为父母生病死亡，自己又染上重病，红军北上时，他留在了家乡，重新当了封建主的奴隶。有多少夜晚，他忆念着与红军共同生活的日子，盼望着红军早日归来。当卓克基解放后，这位老人甚至还跑去要求，希望再参加解放军。现在，朵西斯头已经在公社里过着幸福的生活。最近，他和老伴一次就领得四十多元工资。朵西斯头指指身上的毡帽、灯芯绒衣服和牛皮藏靴，感慨地说：“解放前，我哪能穿上这样的衣服啊！”他像是总结自己的全部经历似地对我说：“我活了五十多年，只有在党的领导下，才过着真正像人一样的生活。”
    在这个地方，二十四年前红军播下的革命种籽，已经发芽、成长、开花。我看到当年牺牲的苏维埃干部和红军的子弟，现在接替了父兄的事业，勤奋辛劳地为藏族人民服务。有一个二十七岁名叫斯达特的青年，父亲1935年参加红军后，牺牲在长征的途中。母亲受尽折磨，死在封建主的牛栏里。那时，年幼的斯达特就孤苦伶仃地带着小妹妹，给封建主当奴隶。他们被奴役得不像人样，封建主竟叫他们“鬼人”。解放后，斯达特终于摆脱了封建主的奴役，参加了工作。党又送他到民族干部学校学习。在民主改革中，他毫不疲倦地工作，发动贫苦农民。改革结束，光荣地参加了中国共产党，积极地领导农民发展互助合作，带头进行耕作技术的改革。现在，斯达特已经被选为乡长，还两次被评选为全县的先进工作者。斯达特回忆了自己的过去，对我说道：“我们藏族人民能有今天的幸福，全靠党和毛主席，全靠千百万像我父亲一样流血牺牲的烈士。我们要担负起他们没有完成的任务。不管有什么艰苦困难，我们一定要叫最美好的共产主义理想，在我们手里实现！”（附图片）
