    New Films from the "August First" Film Studio

    The films produced by the "August First" Film Studio this year are characterized by their focus on military themes. Most of the feature films and documentaries emphasize and reflect the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Party and closely relying on the broad masses of the people, in the revolutionary wars over the years. This year, a documentary about demobilized and transferred soldiers engaged in agricultural construction on the borderlands of the motherland was also produced. Science education films are also in production.

    "The Hui Muslim Detachment" is a film based on a true story from the War of Resistance Against Japan. The film depicts how, in 1938, a volunteer anti-Japanese force spontaneously formed by Hui Muslim brothers in Central Hebei, North China, was established under the leadership of Ma Benzhai. Although this force had achieved some minor victories in the fight against Japanese imperialism, it almost faced the danger of being routed in a battle with a well-equipped and numerically superior enemy due to the lack of a solid mass base. At that time, the Eighth Route Army joined the battle and relieved them. From then on, this spontaneous "Hui Muslim Anti-Japanese Volunteer Force" became a people's army – the Eighth Route Army "Hui Muslim Detachment" – under the leadership of the Party.

    The nearly completed feature film "Land So Rich in Beauty" depicts the story of the people in a mountainous area, under the leadership of the Party and led by the heroic actions of the Communist Youth League member Yue Xian, struggling to harness barren mountains during the Great Leap Forward.

    The documentary "Heroes Conquer the Great Northern Wilderness" records the scenes of demobilized and transferred soldiers of the People's Liberation Army engaged in land reclamation work in the vast land of Heilongjiang Province. This film relatively successfully reflects the heroic spirit of our people's army in overcoming natural difficulties and its tenacity. Some of the scenes in the film are very inspiring, and the beautiful scenery and rich resources of the Great Northern Wilderness are also introduced in the film. "The Green Prairie" records the scenes of demobilized soldiers of thirteen fraternal ethnic groups of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps building farms on the border. The film also introduces the richness and beautiful scenery of Xinjiang.

    The crew of the color widescreen film "Long Live the Red Army," which is currently being filmed, has returned to Beijing from the Sichuan area, where the Red Army once marched through the grasslands, after more than three months of location shooting. This film, co-produced by the "August First" Film Studio and the Beijing Film Studio, is expected to be completed in early September. This film is adapted from the famous stage play "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains," acts four and five. It narrates the heroic and arduous experiences of some ordinary soldiers and commanders of the Red Army during the world-shaking 25,000-li Long March. The film is moving. Its magnificent panorama, the noble proletarian feelings, and the heroic, tenacious, and arduous fighting spirit successfully embody the great theme of the Red Army's Long March.

    "Battle of Shanghai," a color feature film, recently completed location shooting in Shanghai. This film depicts the extremely complex and arduous struggle of the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the battle to liberate Shanghai in May 1949. "Sea Eagle," a color feature film, depicts the story of a heroic torpedo boat detachment of our People's Navy sinking a Chiang bandit warship in a naval battle, after which one of the speedboats was damaged and sank, and the entire crew swam "back to base."

    The color feature film "Hero Island" depicts the story of the heroic people on an island on the front line of coastal defense, persisting in the struggle against the enemy for ten years. During the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait last year, the whole people were soldiers, and the army and civilians jointly defended, heroically striking the enemy, and still standing firm as a hero land under various enemy attacks.

    The heroic deeds of Hu Dean, a brave fighter who was burned in a front-line artillery battle, have also been made into a film by the "August First" Film Studio. The film shows the great qualities of the heroic fighter and the great affection of the people for the fighter. This film is called "Tempered in Fire" and began filming in early July.

    These films will be available to audiences this year or early next year. (Jiang Shui)

    “八一”厂的新影片
    今年八一电影制片厂所摄制的影片，其特点是以军事题材为主。其中大部分艺术片、纪录片着重描写和反映我中国人民解放军在党的领导下，紧密地依靠广大人民，在历年来的革命战争中所进行的英勇斗争的故事。在今年还摄制了转业复员军人在祖国边疆上进行农业建设的纪录片。科学教育片也在摄制当中。
    “回民支队”，是根据抗日战争时期一个真实的故事而摄制的影片。影片描写1938年，在华北冀中有一支回族兄弟自发组成的抗日义勇队在马本斋的率领下建成了。这支部队虽然在抗击日本帝国主义的战斗中曾获得一些微小的胜利，但由于没有巩固的群众基础，在与装备优良，兵力强大的敌人一次战斗中，几乎陷于击溃的危险境地。当时八路军参加了战斗，给他们解了围，从此这支自发的“回民抗日义勇队”在党的领导下成为人民的军队——八路军“回民支队”。
    接近完成的故事片“江山多娇”是描写某山区人民在大跃进中，在党的领导下和共青团员岳仙英雄行为带领下根治荒山的斗争故事。
    纪录片“英雄战胜北大荒”是纪录我人民解放军转业复员军人在黑龙江省的广大土地上从事农垦劳动的情景。这影片比较成功地反映了我人民军队战胜自然困难和坚韧不拔的英雄气概。影片中的一些镜头是很能激动人心的，北大荒的美好景色和丰富的资源，也在影片中作了介绍。“绿色的原野”是纪录新疆生产建设兵团的十三个兄弟民族的复员军人在边疆建设农场的情景，影片也介绍了新疆的富饶和秀丽的风光。
    正在拍摄中的彩色宽银幕影片“红军万岁”这个摄制组，经过三个多月的外景拍摄工作，已由当年红军走过的草地四川地区返回北京，这部由八一电影制片厂和北京电影制片厂合拍的影片，预计在9月初即可全部完成。这部影片是根据著名的舞台剧“万水千山”四、五两幕改编而成，片中叙述了当年红军的一些普通战士和指挥员在震惊世界的二万五千里长征中的英勇而艰苦的经历。影片是感动人的，它那气壮山河的雄伟图景，高尚的无产阶级的感情，英勇顽强，艰苦奋斗的战斗精神，较成功的体现了当年红军长征中的伟大主题思想。
    最近在上海拍完外景的“战上海”是一部彩色故事片。这部影片是描写我中国人民解放军第三野战军在1949年5月解放上海的战役中进行了极为复杂的艰苦斗争。“海鹰”这部彩色故事片，是描写我人民海军某英雄鱼雷艇队在一次海战中，击沉了蒋贼军舰以后，其中一只快艇负伤沉艇，全体艇员泅水“返航”中所发生的事迹。
    彩色故事片“英雄岛”是描写海防前线某一个岛屿上的英雄人民，十年来坚持对敌斗争，在去年台湾海峡风云紧急时期，全民皆兵、军民联防，英勇打击敌人，在敌人多般的打击下，仍至英雄地屹立不动的斗争故事。
    前线炮战中被烧伤的英勇战士胡德安的英雄事迹，也由八一电影制片厂摄制成影片，影片中表现了英雄战士的伟大品质，和人民对战士的伟大情谊。这部影片叫“烈火真金”，在7月初已开拍。
    这些影片，在今年或明年年初，就能同观众见面了。　（江水）
