    Striving to Win Time to the Maximum Extent
    Ya. Kotkovsky, Researcher at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Soviet Academy of Sciences

    The fundamental issue of the Seven-Year Plan proposed by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the accelerated development of the national economy along the path to communism, and the effort by socialism to win time to the maximum extent in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism.

    Time is working effectively for socialism, as demonstrated by the experience of economic development in every socialist country. In 1928-1929, when the Soviet Union embarked on the path of accelerated industrialization, all bourgeois newspapers predicted the failure of the Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan. At that time, the Soviet Union's industrial output was only one-seventeenth of that of the United States. The output of Soviet industrial products was only equivalent to the production level of the United States in 1867, meaning that the Soviet Union's industrial output lagged behind the United States by sixty-two years.

    Reality shattered the conjectures of all ill-intentioned people. With rapid development, the Soviet Union (as can be seen from the charts listed below) had already reached the 1940 level of the United States in industrial production by 1957. The distance by which Soviet industrial production lagged behind the United States was reduced almost threefold, from sixty-two years to seventeen years. The average annual progress the Soviet Union achieved in its industrial development during the period 1929-1957 (even with significant losses during the war years) was equivalent to the progress the United States achieved in two and a half years during the period 1867-1940.

    From Chart One below, one can see how rapid the changes have been in the comparison of industrial production scale, and how this comparison will continue to change in the process of completing the Seven-Year Plan.

    During the war years, which were disastrous for the Soviet people but most profitable for American capitalists, the output of American industrial production was seven times greater than that of Soviet industrial production (1943), but this gap later narrowed to three times by 1953, and further to two times by 1957. In other words, the total amount of Soviet industrial production had reached half of that of the United States.

    The Soviet Union can catch up with the seventeen-year gap in total industrial production at twice the speed or in a shorter time. According to the Seven-Year Plan, industrial production will increase by 80%, and the Soviet Union will reach (as we see from the chart) the current output of the United States.

    The Soviet Union's ability to catch up with the United States rapidly depends not only on the speed of industrial development, but also on the significant material content of each percentage increase. An analysis of the American economy shows that the future annual growth rate of American industrial production will be about 2%. Since the annual growth rate of Soviet industrial production is at least 8.6%, it means that the Soviet Union's industrial progress is at least three times faster than that of the United States.

    The Soviet Union is advancing three times faster than the United States, and the average annual increase in output is more than twice as much as that of the most powerful capitalist country. After the completion of the Seven-Year Plan, it will catch up with the United States in total output after another two years (considering that both the Soviet Union and the United States are moving forward), and after another two or three years, it will catch up with the United States in average output per capita (the Soviet Union's population is about 15%-20% larger than that of the United States). It can be seen that after the completion of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will only need another five years to achieve a decisive economic victory over this richest country. Because our national economic plan has all the potential, it will undoubtedly be completed ahead of schedule, and it seems that victory will come sooner. After the Soviet Union completes the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, it will be able to advance faster along the road of communist construction.

    The unprecedented speed of economic development is a characteristic of all socialist countries. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, other socialist countries have put into production and are building 550 enterprises, and 169 various workshops and work sections; and in the next seven years, due to the huge development of industry, the Soviet Union will be able to help other socialist countries on a larger scale while fulfilling its proletarian internationalist obligations. The Soviet people also rely on the valuable assistance given by the fraternal people of socialist countries to the Soviet Union in the cause of completing the long-term plan.

    Before World War II, the products of capitalist countries were nine times more than those of the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic. After the war, many people's democratic countries broke away from the capitalist system and embarked on the socialist road. With the establishment and development of international socialist economic relations, the speed of industrial development in the socialist camp has greatly exceeded that of the capitalist world. From 1937 to 1958, socialist industry, which increased production by eight and a half times, has actually exceeded the pre-war level of the capitalist world. (See Chart Two)

    The above period conclusively proves that the vitality and strength of social and state systems depend not only on the level of production already achieved, but also on the speed of development. In this regard, socialism has incomparable advantages over capitalism. The average annual growth of industrial production in the entire socialist camp, for example, has been 11% in the past five years, while the entire capitalist world has seen less than 3%.

    Competition with capitalism is a common task of all socialist countries. The Seven-Year Economic Plan for the development of the national economy formulated by the Soviet Union and the long-term plans formulated by other socialist countries show that the comparison of the scale of industrial production between socialism and capitalism will undergo the most fundamental changes by 1965. Fully winning time in the competition with capitalism will ensure the acceleration of economic and social development in every socialist country.

    As the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its work report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress: "The issue of construction speed is the most important issue facing us after the victory of the socialist revolution. Our revolution is for the most rapid development of social productive forces." 1959 is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and in this year, there will be a new great leap forward in the socialist industrial development of China.

    The leaping speed of development in various sectors of the national economy is a characteristic of the people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia. The working people of China, Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania are all making significant contributions to the cause of ensuring the victory of socialism in their peaceful economic competition with capitalism.

    The great leap forward in the economic development of the Soviet Union, China, and every socialist country in recent years will enable the national economic plans to be completed ahead of schedule. Therefore, it can be predicted with full confidence that in seven years, the socialist camp will surpass the imperialist camp in the entire scale of industrial production. The faster growth rate and increasing scale of industrial output will ensure that the socialist world achieves absolute industrial superiority over the capitalist world. This economic victory not only demonstrates the triumphant song of the great ideal of communism, but also is the ultimate guarantee of the complete victory of the forces of peace over the forces of war.

    为最大限度地赢得时间而奋斗
    苏联科学院世界经济和国际关系研究所研究员　雅·科特科夫斯基
    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会提出的七年计划的根本问题，就是沿着通向共产主义的道路加速发展国民经济的问题，就是社会主义在同资本主义和平经济竞赛中最大限度地赢得时间的问题。
    时间正在卓有成效地为社会主义服务，每个社会主义国家经济发展的全部经验都说明了这一点。在1928—1929年，当苏联业已走上加速工业化道路的时候，所有资产阶级报刊都预言苏联第一个五年计划将会遭到失败。当时苏联工业产量只有美国的十七分之一。苏联工业品的产量，只相当于美国在1867年的生产水平，也就是说苏联工业产量落后于美国六十二年。
    现实生活粉碎了一切居心险恶的人们的臆测。在快速发展下，苏联（从下面列举的图表上可以看到这一点）早在1957年工业生产就已达到美国在1940年的水平。苏联工业生产落后于美国的距离，几乎缩短了三倍，即从六十二年缩短到十七年。苏联在1929—1957年时期（甚至在战争年代遭到重大损失的情况下），每年平均在其工业发展方面所取得的进展要等于美国在1867—1940年时期用两年半的时间所取得的进展一样多。
    从后面的图表一可以看出，在工业生产规模的对比方面已发生了怎样迅速的变化以及在完成七年计划的进程中这种对比将怎样不断地发生变化。
    在对苏联人民说来是灾难而对美国资本家说来却是最为有利可图的战争年代里，美国工业生产的产量比苏联工业生产的产量多七倍（1943年），但是这一距离后来到1953年已缩小为三倍，1957年更缩为两倍。换句话说，苏联工业生产总量已达到美国工业生产的一半。
    苏联可以在加倍快或更短一些的时间内在工业生产总产量方面赶上它落后于美国的十七年的距离。按照七年计划，工业生产将增加80％，苏联将达到（如我们从图表上所看到的）美国目前的产量。
    苏联迅速赶上美国的能力不仅取决于工业发展速度，而且取决于每一增长的百分比的重大物质内容。对美国经济的分析表明，未来美国工业生产每年增长的速度约为2％，既然苏联工业生产每年增长的速度至少为8.6％，那末这就意味着苏联工业进展的速度至少要比美国工业快三倍。
    苏联以比美国快三倍的速度向前迈进，平均每年增加的产量要比这个最强大的资本主义国家多两倍。在完成七年计划以后再经过两年它就会在总产量方面赶上美国（要考虑到，苏联和美国都在向前进展），以后再过两三年就将在按人口（苏联人口约比美国多15％—20％）平均产量方面赶上美国。由此可见，苏联在完成七年计划以后，只要再用五年时间就能对这个最富的国家取得决定性的经济胜利。由于在我国国民经济计划中具有一切潜力，无疑地它将会提前完成，看来胜利会更快地来临。苏联在提前完成七年计划以后，就能够更快地沿着共产主义建设的道路前进。
    经济发展的空前速度是所有社会主义国家的特征，现在在苏联援助下，其他社会主义国家已投入生产和正在建设着的企业有五百五十个，各种车间和工段有一百六十九个；而在未来七年中，由于工业的巨大发展，苏联有可能在履行自己无产阶级国际主义义务的同时，更大规模地帮助其他社会主义国家。苏联人民同样也依靠着社会主义国家兄弟的人民对苏联在完成远景计划的事业中给予的宝贵的援助。
    在第二次世界大战前，资本主义国家的产品要比苏联和蒙古人民共和国的产品多九倍。战后许多人民民主国家脱离资本主义体系，走上社会主义道路。随着国际社会主义经济关系的建立和发展，社会主义阵营工业发展的速度大大超过了资本主义世界的速度。从1937年到1958年生产增加了八倍半的社会主义工业，实际上已超过了资本主义世界战前的水平。（见图表二）
    上述这段时期确凿地证明了，社会制度和国家制度的生命力和力量不仅取决于业已达到的生产水平，而且也取决于发展的速度。在这方面，社会主义较资本主义有着无可比拟的优越性。整个社会主义阵营工业生产每年平均的增长，例如在最近五年为11％，而整个资本主义世界却不到3％。
    同资本主义竞赛是所有社会主义国家的共同任务。苏联所制定的发展国民经济的七年经济计划和其他社会主义国家制定的远景计划表明，社会主义和资本主义之间工业生产规模的对比，到1965年将发生最根本的变化。在同资本主义的竞赛中充分赢得时间，将保证加快每个社会主义国家的经济发展和社会发展。
    诚如中国共产党中央委员会向第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的工作报告中所指出的：“建设速度的问题，是社会主义革命胜利后摆在我们面前的最重要的问题。我们的革命就是为了最迅速地发展社会生产力。”1959年是人民中国建国的十周年，在这一年中，中国的社会主义工业发展中将有新的大跃进。
    国民经济各个部门发展的飞跃速度是欧洲和亚洲人民民主国家的特征。中国、朝鲜、越南、蒙古、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚的劳动人民，都在其同资本主义和平的经济竞赛中对保证社会主义胜利的事业作出重大的贡献。
    苏联、中国和每个社会主义国家在最近几年中经济发展的大跃进，将能够提前完成国民经济计划。因此，完全可以满有把握地预言，七年后，在整个工业生产规模方面，社会主义阵营将超过帝国主义阵营。工业产量增长的更快的速度和日益发展的规模，将保证社会主义世界对资本主义世界取得绝对的工业优势。这一经济的胜利不仅表明了共产主义伟大理想的高奏凯歌，而且也是和平力量对战争力量取得彻底胜利的最终保证。（附图表）
