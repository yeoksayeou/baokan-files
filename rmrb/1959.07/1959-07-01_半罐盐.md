    Half a Can of Salt
    Zheng Dongming
    One day in October 1936, our detachment was ordered to transfer from Anfu to Yichun County. When the troops arrived at Mupaishan Village, it was already late at night, and the villagers were all sound asleep. Not wanting to disturb them, we quietly knocked on the door of a peasant family in the moonlight, explained that we were the Red Army who had been there before, and asked them not to be afraid. As soon as this family heard that we were the Red Army who had been there before, they welcomed us into their home like welcoming relatives.
    Although we didn't want to disturb everyone, the news that "the Red Army is here" quickly spread throughout the village, and the quiet mountain village suddenly became lively. Many people ran over to shake hands and say hello to us, some asked if we had eaten, and some asked us to stay at their homes. In the midst of the excitement, an old man walked out of the crowd. Judging by his long beard hanging on his chest, he was at least sixty years old. He pushed through the crowd, angrily grabbed one of our soldiers and asked, "Where is your company commander?" The soldier saw the old man's angry expression and didn't dare answer immediately, wondering, "What's wrong? What does he want the company commander for?" The soldier hesitated, but the old man asked even more urgently: "Which one of you is the company commander?"
    At this moment, our company commander squeezed over from the crowd. He was also unsure what had happened, and said kindly to the old man, "Old man, I am the company commander, is there anything I can do for you?" Before the company commander could finish speaking, the old man interrupted him: "Good! Good! Company commander, which one of you cooked in my house last time? I want to find the one who cooked!"
    "Find the cook?" The company commander thought to himself, "Could it be the cook, Old Fan? But Old Fan is very honest, could it be that he..." While thinking, the company commander turned around and ordered a soldier:
    "Quick, go get Old Fan!"
    After a while, the cook, Old Fan, ran over excitedly in the moonlight, asking from afar, "Did you call me, company commander?" When he saw that there wasn't a trace of a smile on the company commander's face, and the old man standing next to the company commander also had an angry look, he was a little confused.
    "What kind of tricks did you pull when you cooked at this old man's house last time?" the company commander said sternly.
    "Nothing!"
    "Still saying nothing?" The angry old man suddenly took out a dark, shiny porcelain jar from his pocket, placed it in front of everyone, pointed directly at the porcelain jar, and repeated, "You still say nothing?"
    At this time, the comrades around us were very surprised and also very angry. Who would have thought that such a loyal and honest comrade would violate the rules of mass discipline? It was obvious that Old Fan had used up the salt in the old man's porcelain jar, which had made the old man so angry.
    "Yes, I used up half a can of salt, but old man..." Old Fan still looked surprised and was about to continue when the old man interrupted him: "Old man, old man, you say it so nicely, like we're family, but what about you?" He reached into the porcelain jar, took out the contents, and spread them on his palm: "This... this... does this still seem like family?" As he spoke, he was about to stuff the things in his hand into Old Fan's hand.
    We could all see clearly that they were two shining silver dollars and a note.
    Only then did Old Fan realize the old man's intention. He hid his hands behind his back, took a few steps back, and said repeatedly, "Didn't I tell you, the Red Army can't take the people's things for nothing!"
      "Hey, no, the Red Army only gives benefits to the people, doesn't it allow the people to give the Red Army half a can of salt? No matter what, I can't take this money!" Seeing Old Fan retract his hand, the old man got a little angry again, and then stuffed the money into the company commander's hand, forcing the company commander to retreat repeatedly as if dodging a hot coal.
    All the soldiers watching also followed the company commander's movements and retreated, forming a circle around the old man. Everyone said in unison, "Old man, please take the money back!"

    半罐盐
    郑东明
    1936年10月的一天，我们大队奉命由安福转移到宜春县去。当部队到达木排山村时，已是深夜，村子里的乡亲们都熟睡了。我们不敢惊动乡亲，便在月亮光下，悄悄地叫开一家老百姓的门，向他说明了我们是上次来过的红军，请他们不要害怕。这家老百姓一听说我们是上次来过的红军，马上像迎接亲人一样把我们迎接到他的家里。
    尽管我们不想惊动大家，但“红军来了”的消息很快传遍了全村，沉寂的山村突然活跃起来。很多人都跑来向我们握手问好，有的问我们吃了饭没有，有的叫我们到他们家里去住。正在热闹的时候，人群里走出一个老头来，看他长长的胡子挂在胸前，至少已有六十多岁。他拨开人群，气呼呼的拉住我们的一个战士问：“你们的连长在哪里？”这战士看见老头生气的神色不敢马上答腔，心想：出了什么事啦？他找连长做什么呢？战士犹豫着，这老头却问得更急了：“你们连长究竟是哪个？”
    这时，我们的连长从人群那边挤过来，他也弄不清是出了什么事，和蔼地对老头说：“老大爷，我就是连长，你有什么事吗？”连长的话还未说完，老头就打断他的话说：“好！好！连长，你们上次来是哪一个在我家做的饭？我就要找哪个做饭的？”
    “找做饭的？”连长心里想：是炊事员老范吧？可老范这人很老实，难道他……连长一边想着，一边转过身来命令一个战士：
    “快去把老范叫来！”
    隔一会，炊事员老范兴冲冲的踏着满地月光跑来了，老远就问：“是您叫我吗？连长！”当他看到连长脸上没有一丝笑容，连长身边站着的老大爷也一样是副生气的脸孔，弄得有点莫名其妙。
    “上次你在这家老大爷家做饭时又搞了些什么名堂？”连长严肃地说。
    “没有呀！”
    “还说没有？”生气的老大爷呼的一下，从口袋里掏出一个黑黝黝的瓷罐，放在大家面前，用手直指着瓷罐，又重复了一句说：“你还说没有？”
    这时，我们周围的同志都很奇怪也很生气，谁能料想到这样一个忠厚老实的同志，却违犯了群众纪律。很显然，是老范用掉了老大爷瓷罐里的食盐，才惹得老人家这样生气。
    “不错，这半罐盐巴是我用掉的，可是老大爷……”老范还是露出惊讶的神色正想说下去，老大爷接上口说：“老大爷，老大爷，嘴里倒叫得很好听，像是一家人，可你呢？”他将手伸进瓷罐，掏出里面的东西来，摊在手心上：“这……这……还像一家人吗？”说着，他就要把手里的东西往老范手上塞过去。
    我们都看得清清楚楚，是两块闪光的银元和一张字条。
    老范这时才理会到老大爷的来意，他将自己的双手藏过背后，身子往后退了几步，连连说：“老大爷，我不是同你们说过啦，红军不能白要人民的东西！”
      “咳，不行，光兴红军给老百姓好处，就不兴老百姓送红军半罐盐巴吗？说啥也不能要这钱呵！”老大爷看见老范缩回了手，又有点生气，接着又将钱塞到连长手里去，逼得连长也像躲避一块火炭似的连连向后退。
    所有看着的战士一时也都跟着连长的动作直往后退，刚好形成一个圈子，把老大爷围在中间。大家不约而同地齐声说：“老大爷，你把钱收下吧！”
