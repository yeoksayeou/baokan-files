    Preventing Heatstroke in Livestock

    Now is the season of hot and rainy weather. Affected by these natural conditions, livestock are prone to heatstroke. This disease occurs quickly and death follows quickly. If livestock with heatstroke are not rescued in time, there is a risk of death within two or three hours. Therefore, all localities must pay attention to livestock heatstroke prevention.

    Livestock with heatstroke show symptoms of mental lethargy, unsteady movements, high body temperature, rapid and weak pulse, increased and labored breathing, and the conjunctiva of the eyes first turns moist red, then bluish-purple. In severe cases, they exhibit restlessness or manic agitation; before death, they experience whole-body convulsions. Some also die suddenly due to cerebral hemorrhage.

    The main cause of this disease is that during hot weather, the livestock's head is exposed to sunlight, causing cerebral congestion; or when the weather is muggy and the outside humidity is too high, the livestock's body temperature cannot be dissipated. Livestock used for transportation and pigs being transported are particularly susceptible to heatstroke in hot weather. Confining livestock in narrow, stuffy barns also makes them prone to heatstroke.

    This disease can be prevented, and the methods are very simple. When using livestock in hot weather, it is best to use leafy branches or green grass to shade the livestock's head. When the temperature is high at noon, let the livestock rest more. In the afternoon, you can stop working later. Livestock barns should be well-ventilated, and it is even better to set up shady sheds to allow livestock to be fed and rest in cool places. Pigsties should also be well-ventilated, with shady sheds, and it is best to let the pigs bathe every day. When transporting pigs, travel in the cool morning, evening, or night.

    Livestock with heatstroke should be rescued in time. Immediately place the heatstroke livestock in a shady place, let it rest quietly, and promptly pour cold water on its head and body. You can also repeatedly use cold water enemas. In addition, intravenous bloodletting is also effective. Large livestock can generally have 1,000 to 2,000 milliliters of blood drawn; pigs can have 300 to 500 milliliters drawn. Livestock and pigs that are small, thin, weak, and malnourished can have less blood drawn. As for drug treatment, 20% camphor oil can be injected subcutaneously. Large livestock dosage is 10 to 20 milliliters, pigs 3 to 5 milliliters. Lu Rongchun

### 预防牲畜中暑

    预防牲畜中暑
    现在正是气候炎热、多雨的季节，受这种自然条件的影响，牲畜容易中暑。这种病发生很快，死亡也很快。中暑的牲畜如不及时抢救，在二、三个小时内就有死亡的危险。因此，各地要重视牲畜防暑工作。
    中暑的牲畜，表现精神萎靡，行动摇摆不定，体温高，脉快又弱，呼吸次数增加和感到困难，眼结膜先变潮红色，后变蓝紫色；严重时表现精神不安，或发狂噪；在死以前全身痉挛。也有的是由于脑出血，随即突然死亡。
    得这种病的原因，主要是在天气炎热的时候，牲畜头部受日光晒引起脑充血；或在天气闷热，外界湿度过高的时候，牲畜体温不能发散出来而引起的。特别是作运输用的牲畜和赶运的生猪，在炎热的天气最容易中暑。把牲畜关在狭窄、闷热的畜舍里，也容易中暑。
    这种病是可以防止发生的，办法也很简单。在炎热的时候，使用牲畜，最好用带叶子的树枝或青草等，把牲畜头部遮荫起来；中午气温高，让牲畜多休息一会；下午可以晚点停止工作。畜舍应该通风良好，能设荫凉棚，让牲畜在凉爽地方喂养、休息就更好。猪舍也应通风良好，搭上荫凉棚，最好每天让猪洗洗澡。赶运生猪，应在早晚或夜间凉爽时走路。
    中暑的牲畜应及时抢救。将中暑牲畜立即放在荫凉地方，让它安静，及时往头部和全身浇上冷水，也可以反复的用冷水灌肠。另外，静脉放血也有效。大牲畜一般可放血一千至二千毫升；猪可放三百至五百毫升；又小又瘦弱、营养不良的牲畜和猪，可以少放些血。至于药物治疗，可用20％樟脑油，在牲畜皮下注射。大牲畜用量十至二十毫升，猪三至五毫升。　鲁荣春
