    Toothpick Bird
    A crocodile came ashore, wanting to find a comfortable place to sleep. Before it could lie down, a flock of small birds flew head-on toward it. The crocodile looked and opened its big mouth, and the little birds swarmed in like a gust of wind. Did the crocodile eat the birds? No. Because after the birds flew into the crocodile's mouth, the crocodile's mouth remained open. It turned out that the birds flew into the crocodile's mouth to peck at the leftover food in the crocodile's teeth. For the crocodile, this is probably like having food scraps picked out of one's teeth with a toothpick, which would create a feeling of comfort. So they really want the birds to peck around. Sometimes the birds are late and the crocodile has already fallen asleep. They gently flap their wings a few times near the crocodile's mouth. Although this disturbs the crocodile's sweet dreams, the crocodile always happily opens its mouth to greet them and never shows impatience. This kind of bird acts as the crocodile's toothpick, so people often call them "toothpick birds." Because they are the crocodile's confidantes, they are also called "crocodile birds."
    The "toothpick bird" has a very sensitive sense of perception. As long as there is a slight disturbance outside, they will scatter from the crocodile's mouth in a rush. When the crocodile hears the sound of their wings, it will immediately wake up and calmly prepare to meet the enemy. Therefore, the "toothpick bird" is also, in effect, the crocodile's guard.

    牙签鸟 
    鳄鱼上岸来了，正想找一个舒适的地方睡睡，还没有来得及卧下，就有一群小鸟迎面飞撞过来。鳄鱼看看，便张开大嘴，而小鸟则一阵风似的涌了进去。是不是鳄鱼吃掉了小鸟呢？不。因为在小鸟飞进了鳄鱼的嘴以后，鳄鱼的嘴一直就是张开着的。原来小鸟飞到鳄鱼口中去，是为了啄食鳄鱼牙缝中的残碎食物。这对于鳄鱼来说，大概也和人们牙缝中的食物碎屑被牙签剔掉一样，会产生一种舒适之感，所以它们实在也巴不得小鸟们去啄弄一番。有时小鸟来迟了，鳄鱼已经入睡，它们便轻轻地用翅膀在鳄鱼的嘴边拍打几下，这虽然会打扰鳄鱼的清梦，但鳄鱼也总是欣然开口相迎，从来也没有表示过不耐心。这种小鸟由于充当了鳄鱼的牙签，所以人们常叫它们为“牙签鸟”。又因为是鳄鱼的知己，因此又有“鳄鸟”的名称。
    “牙签鸟”的感觉非常灵敏，只要外面稍有点动静，它们便会从鳄鱼的口中一哄而散。鳄鱼一听到它们的振翅声，也会立刻惊醒，从容地作好迎敌的准备。所以“牙签鸟”又无异是鳄鱼的警卫者。
