On the Eve of the Resumption of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference
    Eisenhower Still Insists on Occupying West Berlin
    Lloyd Emphasizes the Need to Reach Some Kind of Agreement
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference is about to resume in three days. People are closely watching the attitude adopted by Western countries. Whether the second stage of the conference can reach an agreement on the West Berlin issue and the German peace treaty issue depends on whether Western countries, especially the United States, are willing to consider the general wishes of public opinion.
    Washington news, U.S. President Eisenhower stated at a press conference on the 8th that the United States is prepared to negotiate and "hopes to find some way to reach a solution that will not make the whole world uneasy"; however, he also said that the U.S. attitude has not changed and still insists on maintaining its rights over Berlin, which is an "unshakable cornerstone." As everyone knows, the reason why the first stage of the conference failed to reach an agreement on the West Berlin issue was precisely because the West was trying its best to maintain its outdated occupation system of West Berlin.
    On the same day, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd also talked about Britain's attitude in the House of Commons. According to a Reuters report from London on the 8th, Lloyd said that in the current state of East-West relations, it is extremely important "to reach some kind of agreement, no matter how limited this agreement is." Lloyd believes that "the atmosphere has steadily improved since February." He believes that it is possible to reach an agreement on the issue of German unification, the issue of West Berlin, or the issue of easing the situation in Europe. When talking about the issue of a summit conference, he said, "We must proceed step by step."
    British Prime Minister Macmillan once again proposed the idea of convening a heads of government conference in his speech. He believes that only at a summit conference can an attempt be made to resolve the many disputes between the Soviet Union and the West. He expressed his belief that a decision on the Berlin issue could be made at this conference, and then discussions could begin on "the broader issues on which the entire future of the world depends." He also believes that the summit conference may also reach an agreement between the East and the West on the cessation of nuclear testing. However, Macmillan also stated that when holding talks with the Soviet Union, the West's policy would still be based on the proposals put forward by the West at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.
    The British Foreign Office announced on the 7th that Western foreign ministers will hold talks on the eve of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. United Press International revealed that the purpose of the Western foreign ministers holding a meeting is to "unify their strategies."

    日内瓦外长会议复会前夕
    艾森豪威尔仍坚持占领西柏林
    劳埃德则强调要达成某种协议
    本报讯　再过三天，日内瓦外长会议就要复会了。人们正在密切注视着西方国家采取的态度。会议的第二阶段能否就西柏林问题和对德和约问题取得协议，要看西方国家特别是美国是否愿意考虑公众舆论的普遍愿望。
    华盛顿消息，美国总统艾森豪威尔8日在记者招待会上表示，美国准备谈判，“希望找到某种办法来达成一种不会使整个世界感到不安的解决”；但是，又说美国的态度并没有改变，依然坚持要保持对柏林的权利，这是“不可动摇的基石”。大家知道，会议的第一阶段所以未能就西柏林问题取得协议，正是由于西方竭力企图保持它们对西柏林的过了时的占领制度。
    同一天，英国外交大臣劳埃德在下院也谈到了英国的态度。据路透社伦敦8日电，劳埃德说，在东西方关系的目前状况下，极为重要的是“达成某种协议，不管这种协议是多么有限。”劳埃德认为，
  “自2月以来，气氛已稳步改善”。他相信有可能就德国统一问题、西柏林问题或缓和欧洲局势问题上达成协议。在谈到最高级会议的问题时，他说，“我们必须一步一步地前进”。
    英国首相麦克米伦在发言时再一次提出召开政府首脑会议的主张。他认为，只有在首脑会议上才能试图解决苏联和西方之间的许多争端。他表示相信，在这个会议上可能就柏林问题作出决定，然后就可以开始讨论“世界的整个将来所系的更广泛的问题”。他还认为，首脑会议或许还能达成东西方关于停止核试验的协议。但是，麦克米伦又表示，在同苏联进行会谈的时候，西方的政策仍然是以西方在日内瓦外长会议上提出的建议为依归。
    英国外交部7日宣布，西方外长将在日内瓦外长会议的前夕举行会谈。合众国际社透露，西方外长举行会议的目的，是为了“统一一下他们的策略”。
