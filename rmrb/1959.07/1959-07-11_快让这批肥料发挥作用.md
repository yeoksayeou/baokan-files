    Quickly Make This Batch of Fertilizer Effective
    Recently, while traveling on official business, I was waiting for a train at the Shuangshipu Railway Station on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway line. I saw that the warehouses, platforms, and freight yards of this station were piled with bacterial fertilizer. After investigation, I learned that this 218 tons of bacterial fertilizer had been stored for half a year.
    What exactly is going on? It turns out that this fertilizer was ordered by the Zhuxi County Commercial Bureau of Hubei Province from Qiqihar and was shipped from Qiqihar to Shuangshipu Station in five batches starting last September. After receiving the goods, this station continuously called the Zhuxi County Commercial Bureau to transport them away, but this bureau ignored them completely.

    爱护物资人人有责
    快让这批肥料发挥作用
    最近我因公外出，在宝成铁路线上的双石铺火车站等车的时候，看到这个车站的库房里、站台上、货场上，到处堆满细菌肥料。经了解，这二百一十八吨细菌肥料已存放半年。
    究竟是怎么回事呢？原来这些肥料是湖北省竹溪县商业局从齐齐哈尔订购来的，去年9月陆续由齐齐哈尔分五批发送到双石铺车站。这个站收到货物后，就连续打电话催竹溪县商业局来运，可是这个局连睬都不睬。
