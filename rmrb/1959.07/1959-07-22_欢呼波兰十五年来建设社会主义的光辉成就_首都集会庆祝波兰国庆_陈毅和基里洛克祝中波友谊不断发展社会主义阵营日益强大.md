Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: Today is the eve of the fifteenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Poland. Tonight, more than 1,500 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally with Polish friends in Beijing to celebrate the glorious achievements of the Polish people in building socialism and the evergreen Sino-Polish fraternal friendship, and to celebrate the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

At the celebration event filled with festive joy, Vice Premier Chen Yi warmly praised the friendship between the Chinese and Polish people in his speech, saying: The brotherly friendship between our two peoples will be as long as the earth and as radiant as the sun. Polish Ambassador to China Kirilo also said enthusiastically in his speech: Our friendship and the constantly strengthening political, economic and cultural cooperation are important factors in our achievements. We believe that this friendship and cooperation will continue to be strengthened and developed.

The celebration was held in the auditorium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The national flags of China and Poland were hung high on the rostrum, and the front of the stage was covered with flowers and palm trees. Huge golden banners reading "Long Live the Unity of the Socialist Camp Headed by the Soviet Union!" and "Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship Between the Chinese and Polish People!" shone brightly under the intense lights. At 7:40 PM, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen and Guo Moruo, and others accompanied Ambassador Kirilo to the rostrum. At this moment, the audience burst into thunderous applause, warmly celebrating the glorious festival of the Polish people.

After Chu Tunan, acting director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, announced the opening of the meeting, the band played the national anthems of Poland and China.

Vice Premier Chen Yi first delivered a speech at the meeting (full text on page 4). On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, he extended the warmest congratulations to the Polish government and the Polish people. In his speech, he praised the long-term and heroic struggle of the Polish people for national and social liberation, and praised the historical achievements of the Polish people in the great cause of socialist construction and safeguarding world peace.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the heroic Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish Workers' Party and later the Polish United Workers' Party, and with the help of the Soviet Union, overcame numerous difficulties on the road forward with the world-renowned "Warsaw speed" and rebuilt their motherland on the ruins of war. Over the past fifteen years, People's Poland has not only healed the wounds of war, but has also leaped from a backward agricultural country to a country of industry and agriculture with advanced socialist industry.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that in recent years, the Polish people have encountered some difficulties on the road forward. However, the Polish United Workers' Party, headed by Comrade Gomulka, corrected the shortcomings of dogmatism that were detached from the masses and from reality, united the party ranks and the people of the whole country, resolutely repelled the attacks of the reactionaries who attempted to use the difficulties to undermine the people's democratic system, cracked down on revisionism that threatened the socialist system, and overcame the difficulties on the road forward, thereby continuing to advance the great cause of socialist construction. He pointed out that the realization of Poland's recently formulated seven-year plan will not only enable Poland to continue to leap forward in socialist construction, but also means that the Polish people will make outstanding contributions in the peaceful competition of the socialist system against the capitalist system.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that People's Poland is an important member of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. It steadfastly implements the policy of alliance with the Soviet Union and unity and cooperation with other socialist countries. It regards the unity of the socialist camp as a guarantee for its own independence, security, and the victory of socialist construction. It struggles against modern revisionism and all other phenomena that undermine and weaken this unity, and constantly makes positive contributions to strengthening this unity.

Vice Premier Chen Yi concluded by saying that we are delighted and encouraged by the achievements of the Polish people, because the achievements of the Polish people are also our achievements, just as our achievements are also the achievements of the Polish people. This close-knit fraternal friendship between our two peoples has deep roots, and these roots lie in our common ideology—Marxism-Leninism—and our common goal—peace and socialism. After the establishment of the people's regimes in the two countries, the inherent fraternal friendship between the two peoples has been continuously deepened through the cooperation and mutual assistance between the parties and the two countries. Whether in safeguarding international peace, in defending the security and territorial integrity of our motherlands, or in socialist construction, we support and help each other. We firmly believe that this fraternal friendship between our two peoples will be as long as the earth and as radiant as the sun.

The audience welcomed Ambassador Kirilo's speech at the meeting with stormy applause (full text on page 4). In his speech, Ambassador Kirilo first pointed out excitedly that in the past fifteen years, under the leadership of the revolutionary party, the Polish people have not only healed the wounds of war, not only greatly exceeded the level of economic and cultural development during the rule of the exploiting classes, but also been able to stand among the most developed countries in Europe.

After introducing the brilliant achievements of the Polish people in socialist construction, Ambassador Kirilo emphasized that all our achievements should first be attributed to the correct leadership of our party and the labor of all the people who recognize its leading force. These achievements are also inseparable from the help and cooperation of the great socialist camp, especially the most powerful country—the Soviet Union. The unity of the socialist camp and the solidarity of its forces are the basic principles of our party and our government's policy. Friendship and cooperation based on the ideological unity of the great principles of Marxism-Leninism connect us with the countries of the entire camp.

Ambassador Kirilo finally warmly praised the achievements of the Chinese people in the great leap forward of socialist construction, and warmly congratulated the continuous strengthening and development of the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Polish people.

Tonight's celebration was jointly sponsored by the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries of the People's Republic of China, the Sino-Polish Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Also present at the meeting were Zeng Yongquan, Xia Yan, Deng Tuo, Xu Zhizhen, Yang Jingren, Yang Hansheng, Shi Liang, Lin Haiyun, Wu Han, heads of various government departments and people's organizations, Polish experts in Beijing, and diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China.

The capital's literary and art circles performed wonderful song and dance music programs at the meeting to celebrate the glorious festival of the Polish people. (Attached photo)

    欢呼波兰十五年来建设社会主义的光辉成就
    首都集会庆祝波兰国庆
    陈毅和基里洛克祝中波友谊不断发展社会主义阵营日益强大
    据新华社21日讯　今天是波兰人民共和国国庆十五周年前夕。首都各界人民一千五百多人在晚间举行盛大集会，同在北京的波兰朋友们一起，共同欢庆波兰人民建设社会主义的辉煌成就和万古长青的中波兄弟友谊，欢庆以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大团结。
    在洋溢着节日欢乐气氛的庆祝盛会上，陈毅副总理在讲话中热烈地歌颂中波两国人民的友谊说：我们两国人民之间的兄弟友谊将和地球一样的长久，和太阳一样的光辉。波兰驻中国大使基里洛克在讲话中也热情地说：我们的友谊和正在不断加强的政治、经济和文化的合作，是我们取得成就的重要因素之一。我们相信这种友谊和合作将不断地加强和发展。
    庆祝大会在政协礼堂举行。中波两国国旗高悬在主席台上，台前布满鲜花和棕榈。“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！”和“中波两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！”的巨幅金字标语，在强烈的灯光照耀下光芒四射。七时四十分，陈毅副总理，李济深、郭沫若副委员长等陪同基里洛克大使登上主席台。这时，全场掌声雷动，热烈庆祝波兰人民的光辉节日。
    对外文化联络委员会代理主任楚图南宣布大会开始以后，乐队奏了波中两国国歌。
    陈毅副总理首先在大会上讲话（全文见第四版）。他代表中国政府和中国人民，向波兰政府和波兰人民致以最热烈的祝贺。他在讲话中歌颂了波兰人民为争取民族解放和社会解放所作的长期英勇斗争，赞扬了波兰人民在社会主义建设和维护世界和平的伟大事业中所获得的历史性成就。
    陈毅副总理说，英勇的波兰人民，在波兰工人党和以后的波兰统一工人党的领导下，在苏联的帮助下，以举世闻名的“华沙速度”，克服了前进道路上的重重困难，在战争废墟上重建自己的祖国。十五年来，人民波兰不仅治好了战争的创伤，而且由落后的农业国一跃而成为具有先进的社会主义工业的工农业国家。
    陈毅副总理说，最近几年来，波兰人民在前进的道路上曾经遇到一些困难。但是，以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党纠正了脱离群众脱离实际的教条主义的缺点，团结了党的队伍和全国人民，坚决击退了妄图利用困难破坏人民民主制度的反动派的进攻，打击了威胁社会主义制度的修正主义，克服了前进道路上的困难，从而把社会主义建设的伟大事业继续推向前进。他指出，波兰最近制定的七年计划的实现，不仅将使波兰在社会主义建设上继续跃进一大步，同时也意味着波兰人民在社会主义体系对资本主义体系的和平竞赛中将要作出卓越的贡献。
    陈毅副总理说，人民波兰是以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营的重要一员。它坚定不移地执行着同苏联同盟、同其他社会主义国家团结合作的政策，它把社会主义阵营的团结看作是自己独立、安全和社会主义建设胜利的保证，它同破坏和削弱这种团结的现代修正主义及其他一切现象进行斗争，不断地为增强这种团结而作出积极的贡献。
    陈毅副总理最后说，我们为波兰人民获得的各项成就而欢欣鼓舞，因为波兰人民的成就也就是我们的成就，正如我们的成就也就是波兰人民的成就一样。我们两国人民间的这种休戚相关的兄弟友谊是有着深刻的根源的，这种根源在于我们有着共同的思想——马克思列宁主义，共同的奋斗目标——和平和社会主义。在两国人民政权建立以后，两国人民固有的兄弟友谊便通过两国党和两个国家之间的合作互助而不断地加深。无论在维护国际和平方面，在保卫自己祖国的安全和领土完整方面，或者在社会主义建设方面，我们都是互相支持和互相帮助的。我们深信我们两国人民间的这种兄弟友谊将和地球一样的长久，和太阳一样的光辉。
    全场以暴风雨般的掌声欢迎基里洛克大使在大会上讲话（全文见第四版）。基里洛克大使在讲话中首先兴奋地指出，十五年来，波兰人民在革命政党的领导下不仅已经医治好战争的创伤，不仅已经大大地超过剥削阶级统治时代的经济和文化发展的水平，而且也能够屹立于欧洲最发达的国家之间。
    基里洛克大使介绍了波兰人民在社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就后强调指出，我们所有的这些成就，首先应归功于我们党的正确领导和承认它的领导力量的全体人民的劳动。这些成就也是与伟大的社会主义阵营，特别是最强大的国家——苏联的帮助和合作分不开的。社会主义阵营的统一及其力量的团结是我们党和我们政府政策的基本原则。奠基在马克思列宁主义伟大原则的思想统一之上的友谊和合作把我们同整个阵营的国家联系在一起。
    基里洛克大使最后热情地赞扬了中国人民在社会主义建设大跃进中取得的成就，热烈祝贺波中人民的友谊和合作不断地加强和发展。
    今晚的庆祝大会是由中华人民共和国对外文化联络委员会、中国波兰友好协会、中华全国总工会、中华全国青年联合会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会和中国文学艺术界联合会联合举办的。出席大会的，还有政府各部门和人民团体的负责人曾涌泉、夏衍、邓拓、许之桢、杨静仁、阳翰笙、史良、林海云、吴晗，波兰在北京的专家，以及各国驻华使节和外交官员。
