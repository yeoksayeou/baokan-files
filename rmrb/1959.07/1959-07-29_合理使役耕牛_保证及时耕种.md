Reasonably Use Draught Cattle to Ensure Timely Planting

During the "Double Rush" battle, the people's communes in Liling County, Hunan Province, fully mobilized the masses, strengthened the protection and care of draught cattle, and paid attention to reasonable use, ensuring that the draught cattle were strong and healthy, and smoothly carried out the work of rushing to harvest and rush to plant.

This year, the area of double-cropping rice in Liling County is very large, accounting for 74% of the total paddy field area. Each draught cattle used in the county bears an average burden of twenty-one mu, the task is very heavy, and the protection and care must be strengthened to ensure fatness and health, in order to do a good job of plowing and harrowing.

At the beginning of the "Double Rush" work, all communes paid attention to fully mobilizing the masses, holding symposiums for feeders and handlers, establishing cattle protection covenants, protecting and caring for the draught cattle, and ensuring that no cattle were overworked, died, or miscarried. They organized competitions and comparisons between teams and people.

In use, all communes achieved reasonable use of cattle. According to the weight of farm work, the strength of the draught cattle, and pregnancy, work was arranged, fields and cattle were fixed, and people were assigned to use them; they grasped both ends and rested in the middle, without rushing or chasing. They adhered to the principle of "four no's": no use in hot weather after 10:00 am and before 3:00 pm, and appropriately added night work, using them for about two hours; no use of sick cattle, and immediately stop if breathing is rapid or white foam is coming out of the mouth; no use in the late stages of pregnancy (one or two months), and reduce labor during mid-pregnancy; no use within two weeks after giving birth.

    合理使役耕牛　保证及时耕种
    湖南醴陵县各个公社在“双抢”战斗中，充分发动群众，加强耕牛护养，注意合理使用，保证了耕牛身强体壮，顺利开展了抢收抢插工作。
    醴陵县今年的双季稻面积很大，占水田总面积的74％。全县役使的耕牛平均每头负担二十一亩，任务非常繁重，必须加强护养，保证膘肥体壮，才能搞好犁耙工夫。
    “双抢”工作一开始，各个公社都注意充分发动群众，召开饲养员、使役员座谈会，订立护牛公约，护养好耕牛，不累坏、死亡和流产一头牛。组织队与队、人与人之间的评比、竞赛。
    使役中，各个公社都做到了合理用牛。根据农活轻重，耕牛体力强弱及怀孕等情况排好工，定田、定牛，专人使用；抓两头、歇中间，不急追猛赶。坚持“四不用”的原则：上午十时以后，下午三时以前，天气酷热不用，夜晚适当加夜工，使用二小时左右；病牛不用，发现呼吸迫促，口吐白沫时，立即停歇；怀孕末期（一、二个月）不用，怀孕中期减轻劳役；产子后两星期以内不用。
