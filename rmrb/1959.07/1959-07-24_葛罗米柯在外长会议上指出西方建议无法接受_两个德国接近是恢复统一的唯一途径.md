Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 23rd: The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Meeting held a plenary session on the 22nd, chaired by Herter.

    The discussion on this day showed that the position of the Western countries, which put forward the proposal of July 20, was completely untenable. Even some bourgeois newspapers in Switzerland have had to regard this proposal as a trick played by the Western delegations, the purpose of which is to try to dilute the negative impression created by their staunch unwillingness to allow the Germans themselves to participate in the negotiations on fundamental national issues such as the peace treaty, the development of contact between the two Germanys, and German reunification.

    The head of the Soviet delegation, Gromyko, spoke first at the meeting on the 22nd, saying that only the rapprochement between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany is the path to restoring German unity. We have said this in the past, we are saying it now, and we will continue to say it in the future. Any other statement means ignoring reality and deliberately blinding others.

    Gromyko refuted the argument of some Western countries, saying that we have heard here the statement that if the Germans negotiate with each other in the All-German Committee or in another way that they can accept, then it seems that it will "deepen the division of Germany." It is surprising that those who oppose the rapprochement between the two parts of Germany are using any unfounded argument to conceal their position. If what is being discussed is the formulation of a common program by the Germans on the issues of the peace treaty and German reunification, how can this "deepen the division"? Since when does the elimination of differences between Germans begin to mean the "deepening of the division" of Germany? This logic is completely wrong. Even if we make an extremely pessimistic and worst-case estimate of the situation, that is, the representatives of the two parts of Germany cannot find a common language through this kind of negotiation, the situation will still be the same as it is now. However, it will benefit from the negotiations, because both sides will better understand each other's positions and see more clearly the difficulties they face, but why should we predict that the situation will definitely be the worst? In short, the excuse that negotiations between Germans will deepen the division of Germany is always artificial, and it can only show that those who oppose the rapprochement between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have reached the point where they have run out of arguments.

    Gromyko condemned the proposal made by the Western countries on July 20 and pointed out that this proposal cannot be accepted as the basis for negotiations.

    Commenting on this Western proposal, he said: "The proposal put forward here a few days ago by the Western delegations does not seek to arrange direct negotiations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, but to turn the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Meeting into some kind of permanent institution, within the scope of which endless and time-unlimited negotiations are held. At the same time, the major powers only study purely German affairs related to German reunification, while the representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany perform the secondary function of "consultants." To be honest, we have already seen in this proposal the blatant expression of the basic position taken by Western countries on the German question. They hope that the four countries will be high above, forcing others to accept their will in formulating various German laws, holding elections and plebiscites in Germany, etc., hoping that the Germans will only obediently carry out this order. And the people who drafted these proposals even talk about German freedom! If this is freedom, then it is only giving foreigners the freedom to force Germans to accept their decisions."

    Gromyko expressed regret at the negative attitude of the Western countries towards the Soviet government's proposal to establish an All-German Committee. He said that the Soviet delegation is ready to continue its efforts to seek a mutually agreed solution to the issues negotiated at the current meeting, and hopes that the Western countries will adopt a more constructive attitude on the realistic path to bringing the two parts of Germany closer together.

    Gromyko said that we are not opposed to exchanging views on the issue of a temporary agreement on West Berlin. He also said that the Soviet Union will not take unilateral action during the period when the temporary agreement on West Berlin is in effect and during the negotiations held by the participating countries of the Geneva Conference to re-examine the West Berlin issue. Of course, our basis is that the other participants in the meeting must not take any actions that undermine the agreement.

    After Gromyko spoke, US Secretary of State Herter then spoke. His speech showed that the representatives of the Western countries could not come up with any reason to oppose the clear and explicit arguments of the Soviet delegation when explaining their position. Herter repeated the old tune of Western propaganda, insisting that the Soviet Union caused the Berlin crisis.

    French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville also made the same speech. He insisted that the issue of the All-German Committee had nothing to do with the issue of West Berlin. Despite the fact that the Soviet delegation, in a series of speeches, including the speech on the 22nd, gave a clear answer to the question of whether there was a danger of the Soviet Union taking unilateral action after the expiration of the temporary agreement on West Berlin, Couve de Murville, like Herter, continued to insist that there was still some ambiguity in this regard.

    Lloyd spoke last, expressing his regret at the Soviet Union's rejection of the Western countries' proposal. He said at the end of his brief speech that he hoped to study Gromyko's speech on the 22nd before expressing his own views.

    The meeting on the 22nd ended here, and the next meeting was decided to be held on the 23rd.

### 葛罗米柯在外长会议上指出西方建议无法接受  两个德国接近是恢复统一的唯一途径

    葛罗米柯在外长会议上指出西方建议无法接受
    两个德国接近是恢复统一的唯一途径
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：日内瓦外长会议22日举行全体会议，由赫脱主持。
    这一天的讨论表明，提出7月20日的建议的西方国家的立场是完全站不住脚的。就连瑞士的某些资产阶级报纸也不得不把这个建议看作是西方国家代表团玩弄的一种手腕，其目的在于：设法冲淡一下由于它们死不愿意让德国人自己有可能参加有关和约、发展两个德国之间的接触和德国统一这样一些全民族性的根本问题的谈判因而造成的不良印象。
    苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯在22日会议上首先发言说，现在只有德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间的接近，才是恢复德国统一的途径。这一点我们过去说过，现在在说，将来也还要说。除此以外的任何说法，都意味着无视现实，蓄意蒙蔽别人的眼睛。
    葛罗米柯驳斥某些西方国家的论点说，我们在这里听到这样一种说法：如果德国人在全德委员会中或是通过另外他们可以接受的方式彼此进行谈判，那么看来会“加深德国的分裂”。令人惊奇的是，反对德国两部分接近的人为了掩饰自己的立场，连任何没有根据的论点都用上了。如果所谈的是德国人就和约和德国统一问题制定共同纲领，又怎样会有这种“加深分裂”呢？从什么时候起，消除德国人之间的分歧开始意味着德国“加深分裂”呢？这种逻辑是完全错误的。即使对情况作极端悲观主义和最坏的估计，即德国两部分的代表通过这种谈判不能找到共同的语言，情况也不过仍然像现在这样。但是，这会从谈判中得到益处，因为双方会更好地了解彼此的立场，更清楚地看到它们面临的困难，可是为什么偏要预测情况一定会是最坏的呢？总之，所谓德国人之间的谈判会使德国的分裂有所加深，这种口实始终是人为的，它只能说明，反对德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国接近的人已达到了理屈词穷的地步。
    葛罗米柯谴责西方国家7月20日提出的建议，并且指出不能接受这个建议作为谈判的基础。
    他在评论西方这个建议时说：“前几天，西方国家代表团在这里提出的建议，不是设法安排德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的直接谈判，而是把日内瓦外长会议变成某种永久性的机构，在这个机构的范围内举行无终止的和无时间限制的谈判，同时，各大国只研究同德国统一有关的纯粹是德国人的事情，而德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的代表却执行“顾问”的次要职能。说实在话，我们在这项建议中已经看到西方国家在德国问题上采取的基本立场的露骨表现。它们希望，四国高高在上，在制定德国各种法律、在德国举行选举和全民投票等等问题上强迫别人接受自己的意志，希望德国人只是顺从地执行这种命令。而起草这些建议的人竟然大谈德国的自由！如果这是自由的话，那么只是让外国有自由强迫德国人接受它们的决定罢了。
    葛罗米柯对于西方国家消极对待苏联政府关于成立全德委员会的建议表示遗憾。他说，苏联代表团准备继续努力寻求就目前会议所谈判的问题取得一致同意解决办法，并希望西方国家在使德国两部分之间接近的现实途径方面会采取比较具有建设性的态度。
    葛罗米柯说，我们不反对就西柏林临时协定问题一并交换意见。他还说，在西柏林临时协定有效期间以及在日内瓦会议参加国为重新研究西柏林问题而举行的谈判过程中，苏联都不会采取单方面的行动。当然，我们的依据是，会议的其他参加者也不得有任何破坏协定的行动。
    葛罗米柯发言后，美国国务卿赫脱接着发言。他的发言表明，西方国家的代表在说明自己立场的时候拿不出任何理由来反对苏联代表团的清楚和明确的论据。赫脱重弹了西方宣传的老调，硬说苏联引起了柏林危机。
    法国外长德姆维尔也作了同样的发言。他硬说全德委员会问题和西柏林问题没有任何联系。尽管苏联代表团在一系列的发言中，包括在22日的发言中，对于西柏林协定有效期限满期以后是否存在苏联采取单方面行动的危险的问题作了明确的答复，德姆维尔还是像赫脱一样，继续硬说在这方面还有某种不明确的地方。
    劳埃德最后发言，他对苏联拒绝西方国家的建议表示遗憾。他在结束他的简短的发言时说，他希望先研究葛罗米柯22日的发言，然后才能发表自己的看法。
    22日会议到此结束，下次会议决定在23日举行。
