Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 4th -- Workers of Baotou Iron and Steel Company are determined to fight a great battle in the third quarter and strive for the early tapping of the No. 1 blast furnace.
The Baotou Iron and Steel Company Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to all employees in late June to strive for early tapping. The broad masses of employees responded to the call of the Party Committee, extensively launched an increase production and practice economy movement centered on quality and rapid construction, and accelerated the construction progress of the No. 1 blast furnace. The bricklaying and furnace building work of the three hot blast stoves is nearing completion, and the bricklaying work of the blast furnace body will begin in another ten days. Yang Changhe, an old crane worker who had previously participated in construction in Beijing, is leading more than seventy people, working day and night to install the equipment for the material truck pit and the material warehouse trestle. They plan to install all thousands of tons of equipment for these two projects before July 20. In July, in addition to rushing to build the blast furnace, hot blast stoves, and feeding system, workers will also need to ensure that the blast furnace working area has access to water, electricity, ventilation, gas, and railways, to prepare conditions for early tapping.
The first water supply system of the Yellow River water supply project has been fully completed, and the first unit of the first thermal power plant is undergoing trial operation and will soon be supplying water, electricity, and heat to the main plant area.
In the past few days, Yang Wei, general manager of Baotou Steel, as well as the Party secretaries and managers of various construction units, have continuously come to the blast furnace construction site to inspect and supervise the work, and to help the construction teams and groups with construction arrangements. During their inspections, they particularly emphasized ensuring the quality of the project. Now, the inspection teams and groups have generally established and improved mass inspection systems. The design institute of the head office and various functional departments and processing departments also regularly send people to the blast furnace construction site to understand the needs of the project and provide timely support.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th -- The workers of the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, who have comprehensively overfulfilled their production plans for six consecutive months, are determined to work hard for three months, continue to strive for "monthly red," and welcome the 10th anniversary of National Day with outstanding production achievements of high quality, high output, and high efficiency.
In the past, every summer, the factory's electron tube yield would decline somewhat due to the effects of temperature and humidity. This year, in order to ensure the stability and continued improvement of the electron tube yield, the factory has formulated a series of measures and is starting to implement them. For example, strengthening the inspection of electron tube parts, especially the inspection of metal parts; strengthening the technical supervision of each process, etc. Most of the various rules and regulations that have been revised and supplemented since the beginning of this year have now begun to be implemented on a trial basis, and after discussion and determination by the workers' congress, they will be further implemented in depth.

    大战三季度　迎接国庆节
    包钢要一号高炉提前出铁
    北京电子管厂健全规章制度大力提高成品率
    新华社包头4日电　包头钢铁公司职工决心大战第三季度，力争一号高炉提前出铁。
    中共包头钢铁公司委员会在6月下旬向全体职工发出了力争提前出铁的战斗号召，广大职工响应党委的号召，广泛开展以优质和快速施工为中心的增产节约运动，加快了一号高炉各项工程的施工进度。三座热风炉的砌砖筑炉工程接近结束，高炉本体的砌筑工程再过十天就要开始。不久以前还在北京参加建设的老起重工杨长河，带领七十多人，正在夜以继日地安装料车坑和料仓栈桥的设备，他们计划在7月20日以前，把这两项工程的几千吨设备全部安装好。高炉斜桥工程即将完工，接着就要开始安装卷扬机。7月份，工人们除了突击建设高炉、热风炉和上料系统以外，还要使高炉工区通水、通电、通风、通煤气、通铁路，给提前出铁准备条件。
    黄河给水工程第一个给水系统已经全部竣工，第一热电站第一机组正在试运转，马上就要向主厂区送水送电送热。
    这几天，包钢总经理杨维以及各施工单位的党委书记、经理不断来高炉工地检查督促，并且帮助各施工队、组进行施工安排。他们在检查中，特别强调要保证工程质量。现在，各工队、工组已经普遍建立和健全了群众性的检查制度。总公司设计院和各职能部门、加工部门，也经常派人来高炉工地了解工程需要，及时给予支援。
    新华社4日讯　连续六个月全面超额完成生产计划的北京电子管厂职工，决心大干三个月，继续争取“月月红”，用高质、高产、高效率的出色生产成绩迎接国庆十周年。
    过去每到暑天，这个厂电子管的成品率都因温度、湿度影响有些下降。今年，为了保证电子管成品率的稳定和继续提高，工厂制订了一系列措施，并着手贯彻。例如，加强了电子管零件的检验，特别是金属零件的检验；加强了每一道工序的技术监督等等。今年以来经过修改充实的各项规章制度，目前大多数都已开始试行，经过职工代表大会讨论确定后，将进一步深入贯彻。（附图片）
