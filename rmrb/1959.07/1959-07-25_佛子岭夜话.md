Night Talk at Fozi Ridge
    Zhang Pei

    Our car passed through Huoshan County in the twilight, and soon a dazzling array of lights appeared in the valley, seemingly telling us: here is a hydropower station, Fozi Ridge has arrived.

    When we set off, we underestimated the mileage from Hefei—Lu'an—Fozi Ridge by fifty kilometers, so we arrived at Fozi Ridge almost an hour later than expected. We originally thought we would have time to admire the reservoir at dusk in May, but now we can only see a tall, towering black shadow—the arch dam—far away in the night sky, and the mountains surrounding the reservoir greet us with silence, vaguely revealing the beautiful peaks of the Dabie Mountains.

    The car stopped in front of a new two-story building, the management office of the Fozi Ridge Hydropower Station. We were downstairs asking for Director Li of the management office when a thin, middle-aged comrade, about fifty years old, wearing a navy blue uniform and of short stature, came down from upstairs.

      “Are you from Hefei?” he asked, sizing us up, and shook hands with us one by one. We handed him the letter of introduction. He glanced at it and put it in his pocket, without introducing his own identity or exchanging any pleasantries, and led us to the guest house on the other side of the river. We thought he must be Director Li of the management office.

    It was a late May evening, and in this mountain-ringed reservoir, the evening breeze was still a bit chilly. We walked along the reservoir road lined with French parasol trees, and within a few minutes, we were at the foot of the dam. There was a row of bright streetlights on the passage in front of the dam, and a rumbling sound came from inside the dam. This was the power station's plant, hidden inside the dam. This is a relatively new method of building hydropower stations.

    Director Li didn't say much to us along the way, but when he passed over a movable bridge over the dam, he told us that because the spillway had been repaired, the water in this mountain ditch was too large to cross, so this bridge suspended by cables was built. He walked slowly in front of us with his hands behind his back, looking not very sturdy. From his few words, I could tell that he was probably from Hubei. Sure enough, when I asked him about his hometown, he said, "Huang'an." Then he added, "Now it's called Hong'an."

    Huang'an, this place was famous during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. Experience told me that Director Li, who was with us, was very likely an old soldier who had emerged from the fierce revolutionary war. The work of a reporter has cultivated my interest in interviewing people. How did he, an old Red Army soldier, come to this reservoir in the Dabie Mountains? I waited for an opportunity to find the answer.
                ＊　＊
    After dinner, we were resting in the clean and bright room of the reservoir guest house when Director Li pushed the door open and came in. We chatted for a while about the scenery of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir. He seemed to have a lot of affection for this remote mountain valley reservoir. He took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and offered them to everyone. He lit one himself.

    "I've been all over this Dabie Mountain." From here, we began a meaningful night talk at the reservoir.

    "In 1931, I joined the Red Army in Huang'an. The following year, our troops marched to Fantong Bridge in Lu'an. We fought a battle east of Fantong Bridge and captured a lot of prisoners. Our company alone captured more than 500 prisoners and seized three mortars and eighteen light and heavy machine guns." I have talked with many old Red Army soldiers, and I am familiar with one of their characteristics: they can talk about the battles they experienced twenty or thirty years ago as clearly as if they happened yesterday. The Battle of Fantong Bridge was the first battle this old soldier entered the Dabie Mountains twenty-eight years ago. And Fantong Bridge was exactly where our car passed three hours ago.

      "I was twenty years old at the time, a deputy squad leader, but I didn't know a single character. Our company commander was from Lu'an, a tall guy named Little Maozi, I still remember him now." Director Li was excited, and the impression that he was somewhat dignified and reserved when we first met had disappeared.

  "After that, we fought Zhengyangguan, Huangchuan, and Guangshan City. We annihilated the Kuomintang's newly formed 20th Division in Guangshan, and then returned to Huang'an. Then we turned around to attack Songbu, besiege Macheng, and fought Xia Douyin's troops." The history of struggle he described was clearly the glorious struggle of a powerful revolutionary base area outside the Central Soviet Area—the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Soviet Area.

      "We traveled all over the Dabie Mountains, but not by car, but on foot. On the Mid-Autumn Festival, the fifteenth day of the eighth month, we left Hubei-Henan-Anhui."

    Then he talked about how he was wounded for the first time (he was wounded a total of eight times), and because of the lack of medical treatment, maggots grew in the wound. He slept on a stretcher for half a month, but he couldn't sleep anymore because he had to give it to the newly wounded. This is an arduous chapter in the history of the Chinese revolution. Snow mountains, grasslands, hunger, and cold were all conquered by the heroic Red Army soldiers. The cruel struggle tested people's loyalty. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1933. In 1934, when crossing the Luding Bridge, he was already a company commander. "It was hard, but we persevered. As a cadre, you have to persevere. How can you do it if the cadre doesn't have the strength?" This is a personal experience of an old Red Army soldier in difficult days.

    Finally, after the heroic Long March, the Red First Front Army, which arrived earlier, and the Red Fourth Front Army from Hubei-Henan-Anhui, met victoriously in Longdong, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The situation of the Chinese struggle entered a new period of transition. In 1937, he became a member of the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army, and from then on, he fought in the Taihang Mountains.

    The struggle was arduous and long, but victory ultimately belonged to the revolutionary army and the revolutionary people.

    "Fifteen years after leaving Hubei-Henan-Anhui, in 1947, I followed Liu and Deng's army to advance into the Dabie Mountains again. The main force continued south to attack the enemy. We were reorganized into a division of the Western Anhui Military Region and stayed in the Dabie Mountains again, fighting Li Pinxian's 'Guangxi Monkeys.' We fought in the Lu'an and Shucheng areas for two years, until the end of the Huaihai Campaign and the national victory."

    At this time, he was a regimental commander. After Director Li finished talking about his flesh-and-blood connection with the Dabie Mountains, I realized exactly what he meant when he said at the beginning, "I've been all over this Dabie Mountain." It contained a history that was so arduous, so long, and so heroic.

    The country was victorious. The revolutionary army, which had experienced long-term battles, should have rested, but "not long after, we were reorganized into a water conservancy construction unit. My regiment took the lead and arrived at the Fozi Ridge construction site in May 1952. When we came, there was nothing here, only mountains. We leveled the ground, built roads, sifted sand, carried large amounts of earth, just like fighting a war." "Just like fighting a war," this simple sentence pointed out the fighting tradition of our army.

    "Later, we stopped carrying earth. Modern large-scale water conservancy construction cannot rely solely on carrying earth. We learned electric welding, drilling, power generation and line repair, pumping and grouting, carpentry, rebar work, cement work, testing..., hundreds of kinds, we learned everything. Now Danjiangkou, Sanmenxia, Liujiaxia, Hainan Island... all have people we sent there. I often receive letters from them." He said here, took a puff of cigarette, showing a kind of gratification. The soldiers can not only fight but also be technicians, participating in the great socialist construction, how can this not make people feel gratified?

    The first large-scale reservoir in the Huai River Basin—the Fozi Ridge Reservoir—was completed. The tall arch dam stood in the middle of the canyon, and a huge artificial lake appeared. Soon, the motor of the generator also started to sound. The people who built the reservoir gradually ran to new construction posts, and a boiling construction site became deserted. "Everyone left, I stayed. The organization wanted someone to guard the reservoir, and I volunteered to be the guard. Here is home, this is also revolution, what's not the same!" Thus, he fought in the Dabie Mountains twice, and then he was the builder and leader of the first large reservoir in the Dabie Mountains (he was the deputy commander of the construction site), and became the manager of the reservoir.

    "Now we are preparing to build the second generating unit of the power station, which has a much larger power generation capacity than the first unit. Our power station is also training hundreds of technicians and skilled workers for four provinces. The entire power station works in three shifts, eight people per shift, but now there are eighty people per shift, one master with nine apprentices, they come from Xinjiang, Guizhou, Guangxi..., and soon they will go back to operate their own hydropower stations. We not only generate electricity, but also raise fish in the reservoir. Now the big fish already weigh twenty or thirty pounds."

    Finally, he told us that his name was Li Biyun, from a middle peasant family, fifty years old this year, and is the director and party secretary of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir and Power Station Management Office.
                    ＊　＊
    It was late at night, we sent off Comrade Li Biyun, and admired the night view of Fozi Ridge in the corridor of the guest house. The lights at the foot of the mountain were twinkling, and the water flowing out of the gaps in the gate was like a small stream, only the gurgling sound could be heard. But I knew that on the other side of the dam, there was an artificial lake stretching for tens of kilometers, and if all the gates were opened, the water would emit an unstoppable impact force. But now, people firmly control it.

    The mountain ditch in front of the guest house, although in the night, can also be seen that it has been planned and renovated, trees, flowers, statues, trails, like a delicate small park. Some flowers and plants that could not be seen clearly emitted a fragrant scent in the May night. I walked back and forth, thinking about Comrade Li Biyun who had just left. An ordinary farmer, in his life, has walked a long, arduous but glorious road. He began to fight in the Dabie Mountains and left it again. After fifteen years of struggle, he returned to the embrace of the Dabie Mountains and fought for its final liberation from suffering. In the war, he shed blood for the Dabie Mountains, and after liberation, he sweated for the prosperity of the Dabie Mountains. When people left, he stayed and became an ordinary reservoir manager. He didn't feel that this position was incompatible with his struggle experience. "This is also revolution," this is the outlook on life he established under the education of the Party. He has no outstanding heroic deeds, but he has contributed his strength to the heroic cause of the proletariat.

    How many thousands of such people are there in our ranks? They are the pillars of our great cause, although people do not know their names. I returned to the bedroom and lay down with excitement and the pleasant feeling of having taken a useful lesson. Tomorrow, we will go to the reservoir to meet the morning sun.

    佛子岭夜话
    张沛
    我们的车子在暮色苍茫中过了霍山县，没有多久，山谷中出现了一片耀眼的灯光，似乎告诉我们：这里有水电站，佛子岭到了。
    我们出发时，把合肥——六安，——佛子岭的里程少算了五十公里，因此达到佛子岭的时间，差不多比预想迟了一个小时。原来以为有时间可以欣赏一下5月的水库黄昏，现在只能在夜空下远远看到一座高大耸立的黑影——连拱坝，而水库周围的群山用沉默来迎接我们，隐隐约约地能窥见大别山秀丽的峰峦。
    车子在一座两层楼的新建筑门口停下来，这是佛子岭水电站的管理处。我们正在楼下打问管理处的李主任，一个瘦瘦的，身穿藏青制服、个儿不高、五十左右的同志从楼上走下来。
      “你们是合肥来的吗？”他打量着我们问了一句，和我们一一握了手，我们把介绍信交给了他。他看了一眼就揣在口袋里，没有介绍他自己的身份，也没有什么寒喧，就领我们到河那边的招待所去。我们想，他一定就是这儿管理处的李主任了。
    这是5月末的夜晚，在这群山环抱的水库里，晚风吹在身上还有些凉意。我们沿着两边栽有法国梧桐的水库马路走去，没有几分钟就到大坝跟前。坝前通道上有一排灼亮的路灯，坝里面发出隆隆的响声，这就是水电站的厂房，它藏在坝里面。这是一种比较新式的水电站的建筑方法。
    一路上，李主任没有和我们说什么话，只是过了大坝走上一座活动桥时，他告诉我们，由于修好了溢洪道，这山沟水大了过不去，才修了这座用缆索吊起的桥。他背着手，慢慢地走在我们的前面，看起来身板儿不大结实。从他不多的话音中，我听得出他大概是湖北人。果然，当我问他的家乡时，他说了一声：“黄安。”接着又补充了一句：“现在叫红安。”
    黄安，这个地方，在第二次国内战争中是一个出名的地方。经验告诉我，和我们在一起的这位李主任，很可能是一个从酷烈的革命战争中走出来的老战士。记者的工作养成了我对人的访问的兴趣。他，一个老红军，是怎样来到这大别山中的水库的呢？我等待着机会寻找答复。
                ＊　＊
    吃过晚饭，我们正在洁净明亮的水库招待所的房间中休息，李主任推门进来了。我们闲话了一阵佛子岭水库的风光，看样子，他对这个偏僻的山谷中的水库很有感情。他从口袋里掏出一包烟来，给我们大家抽，他自己也点上了一枝。
    “这大别山，我算是跑遍了。”从这里，我们开始了一场有意义的水库夜话。
    “1931年，我在黄安参加了红军。第二年，我们的队伍开到六安樊通桥。在樊通桥的东边打了一仗，俘虏了很多，光我们一个连就抓到五百多俘虏兵，还缴了三门迫击炮，十八挺轻重机枪。”我和很多老红军谈过话，我熟悉他们的一个特点是，对于自己在二、三十年前经历过的战斗，能像昨天发生的事一样讲得清清楚楚。樊通桥战斗是这个老战士在二十八年以前进入大别山的第一次战斗。而樊通桥，在三个小时以前，我们的汽车正好经过那个地方。
      “我那时二十岁，当副班长，可一个大字也不认识。我们的连长是六安人，大个儿，名叫小毛子，我现在还记得他。”李主任谈得兴奋了，刚刚见面时觉得他讲话多少有些威严和拘谨的印象已经没有了。
  “以后我们打正阳关，打潢川、打光山城，在光山消灭了国民党的新编二十师，以后又回到黄安，转过头来打宋埠围麻城，打的是夏斗寅部队。”他叙述的这段斗争历史，很显然是中央苏区以外一个强大的革命根据地——鄂豫皖苏区的光辉斗争。
      “我们走遍了大别山，但不是坐汽车，而是用两条腿呀。这一年的八月十五中秋节，我们离开了鄂豫皖。”
    接着他谈到自己怎样第一次挂了彩（他一共挂过八次彩），由于缺乏药物治疗，伤口里生了蛆。睡了半个月担架，又不能睡了，因为要让给新的彩号。这是中国革命史上的一段艰苦的历程，雪山、草地、饥饿、寒冷，都被英勇的红军战士征服了。残酷的斗争考验了人的忠诚，他在1933年加入了中国共产党。1934年过泸定桥时，他已经是一个连长了。“苦是苦呀，可我们挺过来了，当干部就是要挺，干部没有劲还行吗？”这是一个老红军在艰难的日子里的切身体验。
    最后，经过英勇的长征，先期到达的红一方面军和来自鄂豫皖的红四方面军，在陕甘宁边区的陇东胜利会合了。中国的斗争形势，进入了一个新的转变时期。1937年，他成为八路军一二九师的一员，从那以后，他战斗在太行山上。
    斗争是艰苦的、漫长的，但胜利终于是属于革命的军队和革命的人民。
    “离开鄂豫皖十五年后，1947年我又随刘邓大军跃进到大别山。主力部队继续南下打击敌人，我们编为皖西军区的一个师，又留在大别山了，和李品仙的‘广西猴子’作战，在六安、舒城一带打了两年，一直到淮海战役结束，全国胜利。”
    这时，他是一个团长。等李主任讲完了他和大别山的血肉联系，我才确切了解到他在开头讲的一句话：“这大别山我算是跑遍了。”包含着一个多么艰巨、多么漫长而又多么英雄的历史过程。
    全国胜利了，经历过长期战斗的革命军队，照理应当休息休息了，可是“没有多久，我们改编为水利建设部队，我那个团打先锋，在1952年5月开到佛子岭工地。我们来时这里什么都没有，只有大山。我们平地基、修道路、筛沙子、挑大土，和打仗一样。”“和打仗一样”，这句朴质的话，点明了我们军队的战斗传统。
    “以后我们不挑土了，现代化的大型水利建设不能光靠挑土呀，我们学电焊、学钻探、学发电和修理线路，学抽水和灌浆，学木工、钢筋工、洋灰工，学化验……，好几百种，什么都学。现在丹江口、三门峡、刘家峡、海南岛……都有我们派去的人，我常常收到他们的来信。”他讲到这里，使劲抽了一口烟，现出一种快慰的神情。战士既会打仗又是技工，参加到伟大的社会主义建设中来，这怎能不使人快慰呢？
    淮河流域第一个大型水库——佛子岭水库竣工了，高大的连拱坝矗立在峡谷中间，一个巨大的人工湖出现了。不久，发电机的马达也响动起来了，建设水库的人陆陆续续奔向新的建设岗位，一个沸腾的工地冷清下来了。“大家走了，我留下了。组织上要人看水库，我自报奋勇当看守人。这里就是家，这也是革命，哪里不是一样！”于是两次战斗在大别山，以后又是大别山第一个大型水库的建设者和领导者
  （他是建设工地的副指挥），就这样成了水库的管理人。
    “现在我们正准备建设发电站的第二个机组，它比第一个机组发电能力大得多。我们的电站还在为四个省培训几百个技术人员和技术工人。整个电站工作分三班，每班八个人，可是现在一班八十个人，一个师傅带九个徒弟，他们来自新疆、贵州、广西……，不久以后他们就要回去为自己的水电站操作了。我们不光发电，水库还养鱼，现在大鱼已经二、三十斤重了。”
    最后，他才告诉我们他的名字叫李毕云，佃中农出身，今年五十岁，是佛子岭水库和电站管理处的主任和党委书记。
                    ＊　＊
    夜已深，我们送走了李毕云同志，在招待所的走廊里，欣赏佛子岭的夜景。山脚下灯火点点，从闸门的空隙里流出的水，像小河淌水一样，只听到淙淙的声音。可是我知道在大坝那边，是一个长达几十公里的人工湖，如果把所有的闸门都打开，水将会发出无法阻挡的冲击力量。而现在，人牢牢地控制着它。
    招待所前面的山沟，虽然在夜晚，也看得出是有计划地整修过的，树木、花草、塑像、小道，像一个精巧的小公园。一些看不清是什么样的花草，在5月的夜晚散发出一股清香的气息。我来回走动着，脑子还在想着刚刚离开的那个李毕云同志。一个普通的农民，在他的一生中走过了一段悠长、艰难但是光荣的路。他在大别山开始战斗，又离开了它。经过了十五个斗争的春秋，又回到大别山的怀抱，为它最终脱离苦难而战。在战争中，他为大别山流过血，在解放后又为大别山的繁荣流汗。当人们走了以后，他留了下来，成为一个普通的水库管理人员。他并不觉得这个位置和他的斗争资历有什么不吻合的地方。“这也是革命”，这就是他在党的教育下树立起来的人生观。他没有什么特出的英雄事迹，然而他为无产阶级的英雄事业贡献了自己的力量。
    这样的人，在我们的队伍里何止万千？他们是我们伟大事业的支柱，虽然人们并不知道他们的名字。我带着兴奋的和上了一堂有益的课的愉快心情，回到寝室躺下了。明天，我们将迎着朝阳到水库上去。
