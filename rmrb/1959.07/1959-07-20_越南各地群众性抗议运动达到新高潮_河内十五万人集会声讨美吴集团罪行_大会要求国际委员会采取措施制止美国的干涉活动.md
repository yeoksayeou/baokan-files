Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 19th: A mass rally of 150,000 people from all walks of life in Hanoi was held today at the Grand Theater Square to protest the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's intensified expansion of armaments and war preparations in South Vietnam, the massacre of patriotic people, and the bloody crimes of undermining the Geneva Accords.

　　The mass protest actions that have been rising continuously in various parts of North Vietnam for the past five days reached a new climax today. 150,000 people raised their arms and shouted slogans, expressing the voice of more than 20 million people in Vietnam: "U.S. Imperialism Get Out of South Vietnam!" "Stop the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem Clique's Frenzied War Preparations and Crimes of Massacring the People!" "The Geneva Accords Must be Respected and Thoroughly Implemented!"

　　Among those attending the meeting were the heads of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, various political parties, and mass organizations: Ton Duc Thang, Pham Hung, Ton Quang Phiet, Le Dinh Tham, Nguyen Xuan Thuy, Nguyen Cong Hoan, Nguyen Tran, Duong Duc Hien, Hoang Quoc Viet, Nguyen Thi Thap, and others.

　　Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Vietnam also attended today's meeting.

　　Nguyen Xuan Thuy, Vice-Chairman of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, in his long speech at the meeting, first reviewed the implementation of the Geneva Accords signed in 1954 in Indochina over the past five years. He pointed out: "In Vietnam, for the past five years, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been advancing along the path of peace, independence, and democracy; while the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities have been following the path of war, national betrayal, and fascism."

　　Nguyen Xuan Thuy severely condemned a series of crimes committed by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in seriously violating the Geneva Accords. He said: "The South Vietnamese authorities have imported tens of thousands of tons of weapons and war materials from the United States, and thousands of U.S. military advisors and personnel have entered South Vietnam. The U.S. military advisory group is training and commanding the South Vietnamese army in South Vietnam. The United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities are expanding and building many strategic highways, military airports, military docks, and many military bases, and recently have even conspired to import destructive atomic weapons into South Vietnam."

　　Nguyen Xuan Thuy said: "Ngo Dinh Diem, the U.S.'s capable pawn, has rejected all proposals made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to restore normal relations between the two sides and to hold consultative general elections to unify the country, refused to participate in the Joint Commission, and frequently violated the demilitarized zone regulations, causing numerous difficulties for the International Commission's activities in South Vietnam." He said: "In order to suppress the Vietnamese people's desire for peaceful reunification, the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique has implemented a fascist dictatorship policy. A large number of patriotic people have been brutally murdered."

　　Nguyen Xuan Thuy also condemned the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities for colluding with reactionary elements in Cambodia and the Lao Phoui Sananikone clique, as well as the Southeast Asia military bloc. He pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities have participated in the Southeast Asia bloc's military exercises seven times. Recently, some agreements signed between the South Vietnamese authorities and the governments of the United States, the Philippines, Thailand, and Laos are actually in preparation for war. At the same time, he pointed out that the "war reparations agreement" recently signed between the South Vietnamese authorities and the Japanese government is also an illegal deal.

　　Nguyen Xuan Thuy pointed out: "The facts of the past five years have proven that U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are the main obstacles to the cause of Vietnam's reunification. Their crimes threaten the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia."

　　Nguyen Xuan Thuy also condemned the Phoui Sananikone clique for undermining the Geneva Accords and the agreement signed between the Lao Kingdom government and the former Lao Pathet Lao Fighting Units. He said: "The sound of civil war launched by the Lao reactionary authorities is ringing on the Vietnamese border, which cannot but cause special concern to the Vietnamese people."

　　Nguyen Xuan Thuy finally pointed out that the Vietnamese people's just struggle for the reunification of their motherland has received strong support from peace-loving people all over the world. He said: "The Vietnamese people firmly believe that their just cause will surely win, all the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's conspiracies will surely fail, and Vietnam will surely achieve reunification!"

　　Nguyen Xuan Thuy's speech was constantly interrupted by thunderous applause.

　　Hoang Quoc Viet, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, read out the "Letter to the Entire People" from the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front at the meeting.

　　The message called on "the people of the entire country of Vietnam to strengthen unity, resolutely struggle, realize the unification of the country on the basis of independence and democracy, complete the task of the people's democratic and national revolution throughout the country, and strive to consolidate the North as a solid foundation for the struggle to unify the country."

　　The meeting unanimously adopted a letter of recommendation to the International Commission in Vietnam, requesting the Vietnam International Supervisory and Control Commission to take necessary measures to stop U.S. imperialism's interference and war preparation policies in South Vietnam, immediately investigate the Phu Loi massacre, and investigate the South Vietnamese authorities' persecution of the South Vietnamese people and illegal transportation of weapons into South Vietnam. The meeting also passed a telegram to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, expressing gratitude for the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council's decision to designate July 20 as "Vietnam Day."

　　After the meeting, more than 150,000 people who participated in the meeting held a demonstration.

    越南各地群众性抗议运动达到新高潮
    河内十五万人集会声讨美吴集团罪行
    大会要求国际委员会采取措施制止美国的干涉活动
    新华社河内19日电　河内各界人民十五万多人今天在大戏院广场举行大会，抗议美国—吴庭艳集团在南越加紧扩军备战、屠杀爱国人民、破坏日内瓦协议的血腥罪行。
    五天来，北越各地不断高涨的群众性抗议行动，今天达到了新的高潮。十五万人民振臂高呼口号，表达了全越南二千多万人民的心声：“美帝国主义滚出南越！”“制止美吴集团疯狂备战和屠杀人民的罪行！”“日内瓦协议必须得到尊重和彻底履行！”
    出席大会的有越南祖国战线、各政党、各群众团体的负责人：孙德胜、范雄、孙光阀、黎庭探、阮春水、阮公欢、阮阐、杨德贤、黄国越、阮氏十等。
    各国驻越南的外交使节也参加了今天的大会。
    越南亚非人民团结委员会副主席阮春水在大会上发表的长篇讲话中首先回顾了1954年签订的日内瓦协议五年来在印度支那履行的情况。他指出：“在越南，五年来越南民主共和国政府遵循着和平、独立、民主的道路前进；而吴庭艳当局却走着战争、卖国和法西斯的道路。”
    阮春水严厉谴责了美吴集团严重违反日内瓦协议的一系列罪行。他说：“南越当局从美国输入成万吨武器和战争物资，成千名美国军事顾问和人员进入南越。美国的军事顾问团正在南越训练和指挥着南越军队。美国和吴庭艳当局扩建和新建许多战略公路、军用机场、军用码头和许多军事基地，最近还阴谋把毁灭性的原子武器输入南越。”
    阮春水说：“美国的得力走狗吴庭艳拒绝了越南民主共和国提出的恢复双方正常关系、举行协商普选来统一国家的一切建议，拒绝参加联合委员会，经常违反非军事区规章，使国际委员会在南越的活动遇到重重困难。”他说：“为了压制越南人民和平统一的愿望，美吴集团实行法西斯独裁政策。大批爱国人民惨遭杀害。
    阮春水还谴责了吴庭艳当局同柬埔寨的反动分子和老挝培·萨纳尼空集团以及东南亚军事集团勾结的罪行。他指出，南越当局曾经七次参加东南亚集团的军事演习。最近，南越当局同美国、菲律宾、泰国、老挝等国政府签订的一些协定实际上是为了准备战争。他同时指出，南越当局最近同日本政府签订的“战争赔偿协定”也是一种不合法的勾当。
    阮春水指出：“五年来的事实证明，美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团是越南统一事业的主要障碍。它们的罪行威胁到印度支那和东南亚的和平。”
    阮春水还谴责培·萨纳尼空集团破坏日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队之间签订的协议。他说：“老挝反动当局发动的内战的枪声正在越南边境响着，这不能不使越南人民特别关心。”
    阮春水最后指出，越南人民为统一祖国的正义斗争得到世界爱好和平人民的大力支持。他说：“越南人民坚信他们的正义事业必将胜利，美吴集团的一切阴谋必将失败，越南一定会实现统一！”
    阮春水的讲话不断被雷鸣般的掌声打断。
    越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员黄国越在大会上宣读了越南祖国战线中央委员会“告全民书”。
    文告号召“越南全国人民加强团结，坚决斗争，在独立和民主的基础上实现国家的统一，完成全国的人民民主、民族革命的任务，努力巩固北方，作为统一国家的斗争的稳固基础。”
    大会一致通过了给越南国际委员会的建议书，要求越南国际监察和监督委员会采取必要措施来制止美帝国主义在南越的干涉和备战政策，立即调查富利惨案，调查南越当局迫害南越人民和非法把武器运进南越的事件。大会还通过了给亚非人民团结理事会的电报，表示感谢亚非人民团结理事会作出的以7月20日作为“越南日”的决定。
    大会结束后，参加大会的群众十五万多人举行了示威游行。
