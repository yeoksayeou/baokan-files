Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 10th: A communique from the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party was published here on the 10th. The communique stated that the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party held a plenary session in Sofia on the 9th. Todor Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, delivered a report on the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee's current work plan.

In his report, Zhivkov discussed the implementation of Bulgaria's national economic plan for this year. He pointed out that Bulgaria's industrial production plan is being successfully completed this year. In the first quarter, the production plan in this area was completed by 101%, and according to preliminary statistics, the entire first half of the year was completed by 101.4%. The plan to increase labor productivity was overfulfilled by 2.9%. Due to the overfulfillment of the plan to reduce product costs, national industrial enterprises saved a large amount of funds beyond the plan.

When discussing agricultural issues, Zhivkov pointed out that although some areas of Bulgaria suffered natural disasters this year, the agricultural production plan is still being successfully completed. By the end of June, the national irrigated area had increased by 170,000 hectares, and an additional 110,000 hectares of wasteland had been reclaimed.

In his report, Zhivkov also discussed specific issues in industry, construction, domestic trade, public catering, and animal husbandry.

The plenary session adopted a resolution on Zhivkov's report. The resolution stipulates that central plenary sessions will be held successively in October, November, December of this year, and January and February of 1960 to discuss issues related to construction, industry, improvement of the wage system, commerce and public catering, and animal husbandry, respectively.

The meeting believed that before the central plenary sessions are held at the end of this year and the beginning of next year, it is necessary to conduct extensive discussions on the above issues to be discussed at the plenary sessions among Party organizations and the national working people. To this end, the meeting passed a letter to Party organizations at all levels. The letter pointed out that the Central Committee has decided to prepare the above-mentioned central plenary sessions with the widest participation of the entire Party and all working people. Before the convening of these plenary sessions, the production organization and economic leadership organs of the relevant departments of the national economy should, under the leadership of the state committees and Party organizations, discuss the achievements of their units and discuss the issues that currently determine the early and successful completion of the Five-Year Plan to the greatest extent. The letter said that extensive discussions and suggestions from the working people on the above issues will help the Central Committee make comprehensive and well-founded conclusions, and will help it take the most effective measures to successfully solve the issues to be discussed.

    保共中央确定当前工作计划
    十月起连续举行中央全会讨论经济问题
    新华社索非亚10日电　此间10日发表了保加利亚共产党中央委员会的一项公报。公报说，保加利亚共产党中央委员会于9日在索非亚举行了全体会议。保共中央第一书记日夫科夫在会上作了关于保共中央当前的工作计划的报告。
    日夫科夫在报告中谈到了今年保加利亚国民经济计划的执行情况。他指出，今年保加利亚的工业生产计划正在顺利地完成。第一季度，这方面的生产计划完成了101％，而据初步统计整个头半年则完成了101.4％。提高劳动生产率的计划超额2.9％完成了。由于超额完成了降低产品成本的计划，全国工业企业超计划节约了大量的资金。
    在谈到农业问题时，日夫科夫指出，今年保加利亚的一些地区虽然遭到了自然灾害，但是，农业生产计划仍然在顺利地完成。到6月底，全国的灌溉面积已经增加了十七万公顷，此外还开垦了十一万公顷的荒地。
    日夫科夫在报告中还谈到了工业、建筑业、国内贸易、公共饮食业和畜牧业中的具体问题。
    全体会议就日夫科夫的报告通过了一项决议。决议规定在今年10月、11月、12月和1960年1月及2月先后举行中央全体会议，分别讨论建筑业问题、工业问题、有关改善工资制度的问题、关于商业和公共饮食业的问题和畜牧业问题。
    会议认为，在今年年底和明年年初各届中央全会举行之前，有必要在党组织和全国劳动人民中间就全会所要讨论的以上问题广泛展开讨论。为此，会议通过了一封给地方各级党组织的信。信中指出，中央委员会决定在全党和全体劳动人民最广泛的参加之下来准备以上几届中央全会。在这些全会召开以前，国民经济各有关部门的生产组织和经济领导机关应该在各州委员会和党组织的领导下，讨论本单位的工作成绩，并讨论目前在最大程度上决定提前顺利完成五年计划的一些问题。信中说，劳动人民对以上问题广泛展开讨论并提出建议，将帮助中央委员会作出全面的、有根据的结论，并且会有助于它采取最有效的措施来顺利解决将要讨论的问题。
