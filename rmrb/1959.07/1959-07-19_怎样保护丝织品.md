Silk is a high-grade fabric, and the way it is used will affect its lifespan. When washing, it is best to use soap and soap flakes with low alkalinity. First dissolve the soap in boiling water, stir and let it cool, soak the fabric to be washed in warm water first, put it in the soapy warm water and soak for half an hour, gently rub and wash by hand, wash off the soap with clean water, and dry. Special care should be taken when washing rayon fabrics. Do not rub or pull them horizontally, because this type of fiber is easily damaged when wet. After washing, gently squeeze out the water and dry it in a cool and ventilated place to prevent yellowing and embrittlement.

    怎样保护丝织品
    丝绸是高级织品，使用方法好不好，就会影响丝织品的寿命。洗的时候，最好用碱性小的肥皂和皂片。先把肥皂用开水溶化，搅拌待凉，把要洗的织物先用温水浸透，放在肥皂温水中，浸半小时，用手轻轻揉洗，用清水把肥皂洗净，晾干。洗人造丝织物要特别注意，不要硬搓和横拉，因为这种纤维湿时容易拉坏。洗后轻轻把水分压挤出去，晾到阴凉通风的地方，可以防止泛黄和脆化。
