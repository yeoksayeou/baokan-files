    Running Resident Service Stations Well

    While actively restoring and developing service industries, Tianjin, Harbin, and Chengdu are paying attention to organizing resident service stations to provide multifaceted services for the people's lives. There are similar organizations in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. This is a good way to combine service industries with the broad masses of residents.

    In order to meet the diverse needs of the people in their daily lives, service industries should continuously strive to expand and improve their business, and set up more service points and stations as much as possible. However, it is impossible for service industries to take care of all the small needs in people's lives in a short period of time. Therefore, it is very necessary to rely on the masses, mobilize and organize the masses, and help the streets establish resident service organizations. Tianjin and other places have done this, and the ranks of service work have quickly grown, which has brought great convenience to people's lives.

    Resident service stations not only greatly supplement the shortcomings of service industries, but also, because the members of resident service stations are residents themselves, they are very familiar with the lives and needs of the broad masses, and can give play to the convenient and flexible characteristics of resident service stations to better expand and develop new service projects. Tianjin's resident service stations provide services such as asking doctors for residents, taking care of patients, and moving houses for residents, which is a very good example. As long as we adhere to the spirit of caring for the masses and doing everything for the convenience of the people's lives, we will surely achieve better results in expanding service projects.

    Of course, compared with formal service industries, the service technology and business of resident service stations may be a little worse at the beginning. It doesn't matter, the masses will understand this, and besides, the level of service technology can be continuously improved. The key here is to regularly provide guidance and assistance to resident service stations in terms of technology and business. This work needs to be well undertaken by the service departments.

    The establishment of resident service organizations also needs to be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. For example, in places where there are few service points and weak service forces, resident service stations should be established as quickly as possible to meet the needs of the people's lives in this area; in places where service forces can already meet the needs of the masses, it is not necessary to establish resident service stations. In terms of service business, the conditions of residents should also be considered, and it should be organized according to the principle of starting with the simple and then moving to the complex. The method adopted by Tianjin, where service industries and resident service stations both divide labor and cooperate, is an appropriate and feasible method.

    In short, the establishment of resident service stations is of great benefit in the current situation, but this work must be carried out under overall planning and unified leadership. Only after careful investigation and research, and consideration of possible conditions, can resident service stations effectively meet the needs of the people's lives, and can they be consolidated and continuously developed.

    办好居民服务站
    天津、哈尔滨、成都在积极恢复和发展服务性行业的同时，重视组织居民服务站，多方面为人民生活服务。在北京、上海和其它地方也有类似的组织，这是服务行业和广大居民群众相结合的一个好办法。
    为满足人民群众日常生活中多种多样的需要，服务性行业应当不断努力扩大和改进业务，尽可能地增设服务点、站。但服务性行业不可能在一个短时间内，把人民生活中一切细小的需要都包下来，因此依靠群众、发动和组织群众，帮助街道建立居民服务组织，就显得很必要了。天津等地这样做了，服务性工作的队伍很快就发展壮大起来，从而给人民生活带来了很大方便。
    居民服务站不仅大大补充了服务行业的不足，而且由于居民服务站的成员本身就是居民，他们对广大群众的生活和需要十分熟悉，就有可能发挥居民服务站方便、灵活的特点，更好地扩大和发展新的服务项目。天津市居民服务站开展代居民请医生、服侍病人，代居民搬家等业务就是一个很好的例子。只要本着关心群众，一切为了群众生活方便的精神，在扩大服务项目方面一定还会做出更好的成绩来。
    当然，居民服务站比起正规的服务行业来，服务的技术和业务开始时可能要差一些。这不要紧，群众会谅解这一点，何况服务技术水平是可以不断提高的呢。这里，关键在于从技术和业务上经常地给居民服务站以指导和帮助。而这个工作需要服务部门很好地担当起来。
    建立居民服务组织，也需要有领导有步骤地进行。例如，在服务点少、服务力量薄弱的地方，就应当尽可能地迅速成立居民服务站，以满足这一地区群众生活的需要；服务力量已经可以满足群众需要的地方，则不一定成立居民服务站。在服务业务方面，也要考虑居民的条件，本着先简后繁的原则举办。天津市采取的服务行业和居民服务站既分工又协作的办法，是一个适当可行的办法。
    总之，建立居民服务站，在当前的情况下是有很大好处的，但是这一工作又必须在通盘筹划和统一领导之下进行。只有经过周密地调查研究，考虑了可能的条件，居民服务站才能切实地满足人民生活需要，也才能巩固和不断发展。
