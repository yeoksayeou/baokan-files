Urban-Rural Collaboration, Regional Contracting
Liaoning Adopts Various Methods to Strengthen Medical Forces in Mountainous and Rural Areas
Major Shanghai Hospitals Help Grassroots Medical Units Improve Medical Standards

This newspaper reports that Liaoning Province is organizing large-scale urban-rural medical institution collaboration to strengthen medical forces in mountainous and rural areas and improve medical technology levels.

Since May of last year, city hospitals and medical colleges in Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan Iron and Steel, Fushun, Benxi, and Jinzhou have been paying attention to helping establish and improve medical institutions in mountainous areas. They first transferred forces to assist Jianping, Jianchang, Lingyuan, Kuandian, Huanren, Xiuyan, and Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County to establish eight county hospitals and one outpatient department. The personnel and medical equipment of these newly established medical institutions were mostly equipped by urban medical institutions; some of the funding and furniture were also supported by the cities. After receiving support from urban hospitals, the county hospitals in mountainous areas then extracted manpower and materials from the original county hospitals to supplement and establish commune and regional hospitals. For example, Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County used the strength of the original county hospital to establish a regional hospital in Nanggongyingzi. Chaoyang County Hospital, based on the strength of the original county hospital, established a regional hospital in Taipingfangzi, and then used the strength of the original regional hospital to establish a commune hospital. At the same time, urban hospitals also universally established hospitals for various communes in the suburbs using the "hen laying eggs" method. Medical colleges also established hospitals in the suburbs, where they treated community members and used them as places for students to practice and medical staff to work. Thirty-two urban hospitals in the Liaoning Province health administrative system and factory and mining enterprise system were also linked to forty-two county hospitals across the province, each contracting one to two county hospitals to help them improve their medical technology levels. These hospitals adopted a "counterpart exchange" method, where county hospitals sent medical staff to urban hospitals for further study, and urban hospitals also sent medical staff to county hospitals for technical guidance. For example, Shenyang Heping Hospital sent three doctors from the internal medicine, surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology departments to Liaozhong County Hospital for technical guidance; Liaozhong County then sent ten medical staff to Heping Hospital for study. Shenyang Beiguan District Hospital, in addition to rotating medical staff with Shenyang County Xinchengzi Regional Hospital, also established a regular business guidance relationship to treat difficult and complicated patients at the regional hospital. Some urban hospital presidents even personally led medical staff to county hospitals to assist in their work.

Urban hospitals also organized medical teams and prevention and control teams to go deep into mountainous and rural areas to conduct mobile disease prevention and treatment while providing technical guidance to commune hospitals. Over the past year, hospitals in various cities and factories and mines have dispatched a total of 212 medical personnel to form four disease prevention and control teams, which have conducted general surveys and treatments in areas where kala-azar and malaria are prevalent. The Shenyang Branch of the National Association for Science and Technology also dispatched senior medical personnel from major hospitals in Shenyang (including department directors and attending physicians from internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and ophthalmology, totaling 13 people) to form a medical team to assist Qingyuan County Hospital in treating patients, training cadres, and improving the medical system. In Qingyuan, they proposed 77 suggestions for improvement. At the same time, they also opened training classes at the county hospital to give lectures to medical staff from communes and county hospitals.

Thanks to the support of urban medical institutions, the face of medical undertakings in mountainous and rural areas has greatly changed. In the past, the original county hospital in Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County could only solve general medical problems due to its weak strength and rudimentary equipment. When encountering difficult and complicated patients, they would be transferred to the central hospital in Jinzhou. Now, this hospital can not only solve lower abdominal surgeries well, but also solve many upper abdominal and orthopedic surgeries well. Qingyuan County Hospital used to transfer patients to other hospitals when encountering difficult and complicated patients, and the masses called it a "transfer station," but now it can also treat many difficult and complicated diseases.

The establishment and improvement of medical institutions at all levels in mountainous and rural areas, and the rapid improvement of medical technology levels, have enabled many patients to quickly recover their health and return to production. At the same time, it has also encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses. A 40-year-old primiparous woman with osteomalacia and a small pelvis in Qingyuan County underwent a cesarean section at the county hospital, saving the lives of both mother and child. Her whole family was very grateful, and her production enthusiasm was even higher. After hearing the news of the establishment of the county hospital, the migrant workers at the Houfen Township Reservoir construction site in Kazuo Mongolian Autonomous County regarded it as a great event and immediately launched a labor competition, shortening the project duration by 30 days.

This newspaper reports that Shanghai's districts and counties have initially formed a medical prevention network. There are currently more than 3,000 medical and health institutions at all levels in the city, more than nine times the 350 or so before liberation; hospitals have more than 28,000 beds, more than one and a half times the more than 10,000 beds established in Shanghai in the nearly 100 years before liberation. Many large hospitals, central hospitals, and grassroots medical units have established regular contact and used various methods to help grassroots medical units improve their medical standards.

In recent years, Shanghai has rectified, transformed, and expanded the original municipal hospitals, and also newly established many hospitals or health centers in industrial areas and new worker residential areas such as Kongjiang, Changbai, and Caoyang. Health stations have been universally established in factories, streets, institutions, and schools. There are also 746 hospitals (including 539 maternity hospitals) in the suburbs, and every people's commune has hospitals and maternity hospitals, and general production brigades have health rooms. In addition, assistance has been given to establish many joint medical institutions for practicing medical personnel; and many prevention and treatment centers have been established for disease prevention and treatment. Since the implementation of the "district medical treatment" system, municipal and district central hospitals, large hospitals, and grassroots medical units have had clear divisions of labor. Grassroots medical units are responsible for the treatment of general common diseases, and when encountering difficult diseases, they are transferred to district-level or municipal-level hospitals for treatment. In this way, it is urgently necessary to improve the medical level of grassroots medical units in order to truly achieve "nearby medical treatment" and relieve patients of their suffering in a timely manner. To this end, the method of linking large hospitals with grassroots medical units has been adopted to regularly help grassroots medical staff improve their professional level, with good results.

Major hospitals have combined with actual medical problems to hold various lectures and academic report meetings, absorbing grassroots medical staff to participate. Renji Hospital has held two academic report meetings on "Diagnosis and Treatment of Headache" in the Department of Neurology and "Cardiac Auscultation" in the Department of Internal Medicine. Some hospitals hold training classes or advanced training classes, absorbing grassroots doctors to systematically study in the hospital during their spare time or short-term off-the-job training. The Fourth People's Hospital also runs a part-time school, absorbing some head nurses and above from clinics and health stations to study for three nights a week, starting with the basic theory of anatomy, physiology, etc., and then studying specialized knowledge by subject. Guangci Hospital is preparing to open three training classes in ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and dermatology, absorbing grassroots doctors and nurses for ten days of full-time or two weeks of part-time training, combined with outpatient internships, to systematically study their professions. The Ninth People's Hospital plans to train and improve the health workers of the street health stations it is linked to to the level of medical assistants. Now, it gives them professional lectures once a week, and conducts centralized training in conjunction with pest control and disease prevention work, so that they can not only master preventive injections and simple treatments, but also master a series of inspection techniques such as collecting specimens, smears, and looking at microscopes.

With the active help of major hospitals, the medical level of grassroots medical institutions has been improved. With the help of the Ninth People's Hospital, the medical office of the Jiuxin Enamel Factory has generally been able to independently handle common stomach diseases and stubborn diseases such as high blood pressure in the factory. In the past, an average of 20 to 30 patients had to be transferred to the hospital every day because the medical office could not treat them, but now there are only four to five people. With the help of the Ninth People's Hospital, the Hengda Yarn Factory Health Station has established a workshop health station and a system of medical staff following shifts for treatment and workshop rounds for treatment, so that minor illnesses can be treated in the workshop.

    上海各大医院帮助基层医疗单位提高医疗水平
    本报讯　辽宁省组织城乡医疗机构大协作，增强山区和农村的医疗力量，提高医疗技术水平。
    从去年5月以来，沈阳、旅大、鞍钢、抚顺、本溪、锦州等城市医院和医学院校，都注意帮助建立和健全山区的医疗机构。他们首先抽调力量协助建平、建昌、凌源、宽甸、桓仁、岫岩、喀左蒙古族自治县等九个山区县，建立了八所县医院和一个门诊部。这些新建医疗机构的人员和医疗设备，大部分都由城市医疗机构予以配备；一部分经费和家具，也由城市支援。各山区县医院在获得城市医院的支援以后，又抽出原有县医院的人力、物力，去充实和建立公社和地区医院。如喀左蒙古族自治县，就以原有县医院的力量，在南弓营子建立了地区医院。朝阳县医院以原有县医院的力量，除在太平房子建立了地区医院以外，又以原有地区医院的力量建立起公社医院。同时，各城市医院还以“母鸡下蛋”的方法，普遍为市郊各公社建立了医院。医学院校也在郊区建立起医院，他们一方面为社员治病，一方面当作学生实习和医务人员下放锻炼的场所。辽宁省卫生行政系统和厂矿企业系统的三十二个城市医院，也和全省四十二个县医院挂钩，分别包干一个到二个县医院，帮助他们提高医疗技术水平。这些医院采取“对口交换”的办法，县医院派医务人员到城市医院进修，城市医院也派医务人员到县医院进行技术指导。如沈阳市和平医院，就派了内、外、妇产科三名医师，到辽中县医院进行技术指导；而辽中县又派了十名医务人员，到和平医院学习。沈阳市北关区医院，除与沈阳县新城子地区医院轮换医务人员外，并建立起经常性的业务指导关系，为地区医院受治疑难病人。有些城市医院的院长，还亲自带领医务人员去县医院协助工作。
    各城市医院还组织医疗队、防治队，深入到山区和农村，一面巡回防治疾病，一面对公社医院进行技术指导。一年多来，各市各厂矿医院共抽调医务人员二百一十二人，合组成四个疾病防治队，在黑热病和疟疾的流行区，进行普查和治疗。全国科联沈阳分会还抽调沈阳市各大医院高级医务人员（包括内、外、妇产、眼科的科主任、主治医师等十三人）组成医疗队，协助清原县医院治疗病人，培养干部，和改进医疗制度。在清原，他们曾提出了七十七项改进意见。同时，他们还在县医院开办了训练班，为公社和县医院医务人员上课。
    由于城市医疗机构的支援，大大改变了山区和农村医疗事业的面貌。过去，喀左蒙古族自治县原有的县医院，由于力量薄弱和设备简陋，只能解决一般的医疗问题。遇到疑难病人，就往锦州市中心医院转送。现在，这个医院不仅能很好解决下腹部手术，而且，有许多上腹部手术和骨科手术也能很好解决。清原县医院过去遇到疑难病人就转院，群众叫它是“转运站”，现在，也能医疗许多疑难病症。
    由于山区和农村各级医疗机构的建立与健全，医疗技术水平的迅速提高，使得许多患者能很快地恢复健康，投入生产。同时，也鼓舞了群众的生产热情。清原县有一位四十多岁患骨软化性小骨盆的初产妇，在县医院做了破腹产手术，保全了母子性命，她全家都很感激，生产情绪更加高涨。喀左蒙古族自治县后坟乡水库工地的民工，听到办好了县医院的消息后，把它当做一大喜事，立即发动劳动竞赛，缩短了工程日三十天。
    本报讯　上海市各区各县已经初步形成医疗预防网。全市目前共有各级医疗保健机构三千多个，比解放前的三百五十多个增加了九倍多；医院共拥有二万八千多张病床，比解放前上海市近百年所建立的一万多张病床增加了一倍半以上。许多大医院、中心医院，和基层医疗单位建立了经常联系，同时用各种办法帮助基层医疗单位提高医疗水平。
    这几年来，上海市整顿改造扩充了原有的市立医院，同时在工业区和控江、长白、曹杨等工人新住宅区新建立了不少医院或卫生所。在工厂、街道、机关、学校普遍地设立了保健站。郊区也有七百四十六所医院（其中包括五百三十九所产院），已经做到了每个人民公社都有医院、产院，一般生产大队都有保健室。此外，还帮助开业医务人员建立不少联合医疗机构；在疾病防治方面设立了许多防治所。自从实行“划区医疗”制以后，市、区中心医院、大医院和基层医疗单位有了明确分工。基层医疗单位负担一般常见疾病的治疗任务，遇有疑难病时，再转区级或市级医院治疗。这样，迫切需要提高基层医疗单位的医疗水平，以便确实做到“就近就医”，及时为病人解除痛苦。为此，采用了大医院和基层医疗单位挂钩的办法，经常帮助基层医务人员提高业务水平，效果很好。
    各大医院结合实际医疗中的问题，举办了各种讲座和学术报告会，吸收基层医务人员参加。仁济医院已举办了神经科“头痛的诊断与治疗”和内科“心脏听诊”两次学术报告会。有的医院举办训练班或进修班，吸收基层医生业余或短期脱产到医院系统地进行学习。第四人民医院还举办了业余学校，吸收一些门诊所、保健站的护士长以上的人，每周学习三个晚上，从学解剖学、生理学等基础理论开始，以后将分科学习专门知识。广慈医院准备开办眼、耳、鼻、喉和皮肤等三科训练班，吸收基层医生和护士，脱产十天或半脱产二星期，结合门诊实习，系统地学习业务。第九人民医院计划把自己所挂钩的街道保健站保健员，培养提高到医士水平，现在，每周为他们讲业务课一次，并结合除害灭病和预防工作集中训练，使他们不仅会预防注射，进行简易的治疗，而且能够掌握收标本、涂片、看显微镜等一系列的检验技术。
    经过大医院的积极帮助，基层医疗机构医疗水平已有提高。久新搪瓷厂医务室，经过第九人民医院的各种帮助，对工厂中常见的胃病和高血压等顽固疾病，一般已能独立处理，过去平均每天要有二十到三十个病人因医务室无法治疗而转到医院去，现在只有四到五人。恒大纱厂保健站在第九人民医院的帮助下，建立了车间保健站和医务人员跟班治疗、车间巡回治疗等制度后，已做到小毛病不出车间就可得到医治了。（附图片）
