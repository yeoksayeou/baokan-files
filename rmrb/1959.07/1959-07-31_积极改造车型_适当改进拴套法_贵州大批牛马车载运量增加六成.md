Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 30th - Guizhou Province has increased the carrying capacity of more than 28,000 ox and horse carts by an average of 60% after renovations.

Currently, over 35,000 ox and horse carts in Guizhou Province participate in transportation, with an average daily transport volume of 25,000 tons, accounting for approximately 75% of the province's average daily highway transport volume. However, in the past, these vehicles had small load capacities and slow speeds due to their rough and heavy construction. The average carrying capacity per vehicle was only about 250 kilograms, and the daily journey was about 40 kilometers, which could not meet the needs of rapid industrial and agricultural development. In order to further tap the transportation potential of ox and horse carts, transportation departments throughout the province have been carrying out renovation work on ox and horse carts since January of this year, based on requirements such as light weight, large load capacity, and fast speed. Anshun, Tongren, Pingba and other counties changed the single-set small double-wheeled wooden axle wooden-wheeled horse cart to a three-set large rubber-tired horse cart, and the transport volume increased from 250 kilograms to 1,500 kilograms each time. Luodian, Huangping and other counties changed the single-set wooden wheel ox carts to single-set rubber-tired three-wheeled ox carts, and the transport volume also increased by more than 60%, and the daily journey increased by more than ten kilometers.

In the process of transforming vehicle types, various localities have also improved the hitching method based on the principle of fully utilizing traction, changing the rigid yoke that was consistently attached to the shaft to an axle yoke (i.e., a soft yoke), so that the animal power traction is directly used on the wheels, increasing the traction capacity. According to surveys in Huishui, Tongren, Luodian and other counties, work efficiency is generally increased by 16%. Transportation departments in Qiannan, Zunyi and other places have also installed brakes on ox and horse carts to ensure the safety of vehicles.

Transportation departments in various localities have tried their best to use substitutes in the renovation of ox and horse carts to overcome the difficulties of a lack of raw materials and materials. Zhijin County used cast iron tile rings to quickly convert 200 wooden wheel carts into rubber-tired carts. Sinan, Huangping and other counties have widely used wrought iron to forge wheels to overcome the shortage of steel.

### 积极改造车型　适当改进拴套法  贵州大批牛马车载运量增加六成

    积极改造车型　适当改进拴套法
    贵州大批牛马车载运量增加六成
    据新华社贵阳30日电　贵州省有二万八千多辆牛、马车经过改造之后，载运量平均增加了60％。
    贵州省目前有三万五千多辆牛、马车参加运输，平均日运量达二万五千吨，约占全省公路平均日运量的75％。但是，过去这些车辆由于构造粗糙和笨重，载重量小，行速很慢，平均每车每次运量只有二百五十公斤左右，每日行程约四十公里，不能满足工农业迅速发展的要求。为了进一步挖掘牛、马车运输潜力，从今年1月起，全省各地运输部门，都根据体轻、载量大、行速快等要求，对牛马车展开了改造工作。安顺、铜仁、平坝等县，把单套小型双轮木轴木轮马车改为三套大汽轮马车以后，每次运量由二百五十公斤上升到一千五百公斤。罗甸、黄平等县，把单套木轮牛车改为单套汽轮三轮牛车，运输量也提高了60％以上，日行程增加了十多公里。
    在改造车型的过程中，各地还根据充分利用牵引能力的原理，改进了拴套法，把一贯拴在辕杆上的辕杆套（即硬套）改为车轴套（即软套），使畜力牵引力直接用于轮上，增大牵引能力。据惠水、铜仁、罗甸等县的调查，一般提高工效16％。黔南、遵义等地的运输部门，为了保证车辆行驶安全，还给牛、马车安上了刹车。
    各地运输部门改造牛、马车，都尽量采用代用品，克服原料和材料缺乏的困难。织金县用生铁铸瓦圈，把二百部木轮车迅速改成了胶轮车。思南、黄平等县，广泛利用毛铁锻造车轮，克服钢材不足的困难。
