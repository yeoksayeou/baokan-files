Establishing Production Bases and Arranging Time Reasonably
Jiangyin Agricultural Middle School Excels in Labor and Teaching

    (Our report) Jiangyin County Agricultural Middle Schools have been further consolidated and improved through self-sufficiency in production. Of the 48 agricultural middle schools in the county, 13 have achieved self-sufficiency in teachers' salaries, student book fees, and food expenses; 23 have achieved partial self-sufficiency (the remaining 12 are day schools).
    To achieve self-sufficiency in production, agricultural middle schools must pay attention to production layout and the establishment of production labor bases. Eleven agricultural middle schools in Jiangyin County have implemented a combination of agriculture and sideline occupations. These eleven schools have more than 2,900 students, cultivating more than 1,400 mu of land, averaging 0.56 mu per person. The land they cultivate is obtained in three ways: the people's communes and production teams allocate land they cannot cultivate themselves to the agricultural middle schools; some agricultural middle schools have reclaimed some wasteland; and some agricultural middle schools that temporarily do not have land have adopted the method of linking up with nearby production brigades, signing contracts for contracting labor, contracting capital, and contracting production. The production teams pay the agricultural middle school students labor remuneration according to the team's labor remuneration standards, and the excess production is awarded to the agricultural middle school. For production tools used by the agricultural middle schools, students are mobilized to bring their own small farm implements, and large farm implements are arranged uniformly by the production teams. If the production brigades or production teams have surplus farm implements, the agricultural middle schools go through leasing procedures with them. Agricultural middle schools that do not have surplus farm implements and have no conditions for self-manufacturing exchange labor with production teams using manpower and materials.
    Although there are certain difficulties in establishing production bases, they can be overcome with the strengthened leadership of the commune party committees and the support of the masses of commune members. Ligang and Shengang Agricultural Middle Schools have adopted the principle of "easy first, difficult later, looking downward, self-reliance, starting from nothing, and growing from small to large," and gradually established production bases. The funds needed for sideline production are resolved according to the principle of "easy first, difficult later, and acting according to one's capabilities." Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School started with small workshops that cost little or no money, and then gradually expanded and developed. When they conducted technical assessments among the students, they found that these children from peasant families were mostly skilled in some household sideline skills, and many students could weave cattail bags and make straw sandals. Since there were no problems with raw materials and sales in these areas, they first established cattail bag and straw sandal workshops. Now, the sideline occupations of Ligang, Shengang, and Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle Schools include weaving cattail bags, reeds, and straw bags, making straw sandals, making farm implements, and doing sewing processing for the commune. In addition, there are also breeding and silkworm raising industries. In the case of difficult conditions, it is also necessary for the commune party committee to provide support. 24% of the production funds of Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School are supported by the commune. Many agricultural middle schools are studying production layouts in accordance with local conditions. In the beginning, they focus on sideline occupations and high-yield cash crops in order to lay an economic foundation for self-sufficiency. In agricultural production, they adapt to the characteristics of agricultural middle school students' young age, focusing on less planting with high yields, and striving to become a banner of high-yield and abundant production in rural areas.
    The purpose of self-sufficiency in production in agricultural middle schools is to consolidate agricultural middle schools and improve the quality of teaching. The leaders of many commune party committees and agricultural middle schools have gradually clarified this point. While planning for self-sufficiency in production, agricultural middle schools have made proper arrangements for the time for production labor and teaching. Generally, classes are held in the morning, one hour in the morning and two hours in the evening for self-study, and five hours in the afternoon are for labor. Labor for half a day on Sundays and rest for half a day. During the busy farming season, labor is performed all day when necessary; on rainy days, in addition to indoor sideline production as usual, the rest of the people teach all day.
    In order to ensure the improvement of teaching quality, agricultural middle schools have arranged sufficient time for teachers to study independently, prepare lessons, and correct homework. Ligang and other agricultural middle schools stipulate that teachers, in addition to teaching in the morning and participating in labor for two afternoons a week, arrange their own time to prepare lessons, correct homework, and study independently. The teachers of Ligang Agricultural Middle School often go to Ligang Ordinary Middle School to listen to classes and learn from ordinary middle school teachers. They also jointly established teaching and research groups with ordinary middle school teachers to frequently exchange teaching experiences and discuss issues of improving teaching quality. The exam results of each subject this semester have made significant progress compared with the previous semester. In the first grade of Mazhen Agricultural Middle School, the average score in Chinese for 49 people was 72.8 points, an increase of 9.8 points compared to the average of 63 points in Chinese in the previous semester.
    The party committees at all levels in Jiangsu Province are very concerned about the self-sufficiency in production of agricultural middle schools. Comrade Chen Guang, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, and the Director of the Education Department have, since March of this year, visited agricultural middle schools twice in less than three months, held discussions with teachers, students, parents, and commune cadres to understand the self-sufficiency in production of agricultural middle schools, help them study problems, and promote the upsurge of production and teaching in agricultural middle schools. The commune party committees have recognized the significance of running agricultural middle schools well, and have selected some commune and team cadres to serve as principals or vice-principals of agricultural middle schools to help agricultural middle schools strengthen production management. Some communes have also selected some old farmers and technicians to guide production technology in agricultural middle schools. Many communes have introduced sideline businesses with no problems in production, supply, and sales, and with low intensity of physical labor to agricultural middle schools to help agricultural middle schools create conditions for self-sufficiency in production.
    The experience of Jiangyin County proves that the self-sufficiency in production of agricultural middle schools has played an important role in consolidating agricultural middle schools. It has reduced the burden on production teams and students' parents, making cadres and parents support it, and making teachers and students feel at ease in teaching and learning. It has also unified labor and teaching in teaching arrangements, making teaching and labor more closely integrated, and greatly enriching teaching content. Students have also found it easier to consolidate their book knowledge after labor practice. At present, many agricultural middle schools are not only a banner of the rural cultural revolution, but also pioneers in high-yield rice and wheat experiments. Here, a large number of junior technical talents will be trained for rural mechanization and electrification. (Attached picture)

    建立生产基地　合理安排时间
    江阴农业中学劳动好教学好
    本报讯　记者徐文报道：江阴县农业中学通过生产自给，得到了进一步的巩固和提高。全县四十八所农业中学，已经有十三所实现了教师工资、学生书籍费和菜金的自给；二十三所实行了部分自给（其余十二所是学生走读）。
    农业中学实行生产自给，一定要注意生产布局和建立生产劳动的基地。江阴县有十一所农业中学实行了农、副业并举。十一所学校有学生二千九百多人，种田一千四百多亩，平均每人零点五六亩。他们耕种的土地，从三个方面解决：由人民公社生产队把种不过来的土地划给农业中学耕种；有的农业中学开垦了一些荒地；有的暂时没有土地的农业中学，采取和附近生产大队挂钩的办法，签订包工、包本、包产的合同，生产队按本队的劳动报酬按劳付酬给农业中学的学生，超产部分奖给农业中学。农业中学使用的生产工具，小型农具动员学生自带，大型农具由生产队统一安排。如果生产大队或生产队有多余的农具，农业中学就和他们办理租用手续。生产队没有多余的农具，又无条件自制的农业中学，就用人工、物资和生产队换工。
    建立生产基地，虽然有一定的困难，但在公社党委加强领导和社员群众支持下是可以克服的。利港、申港农业中学采取了“先易后难，眼睛向下，自力更生，从无到有，从小到大”的原则，逐步地建立了生产基地。副业生产所需要的资金，是采用“先易后难，量力而行”的原则解决的。西石桥农业中学就是从先办不花钱或少花钱的小工场着手，然后再逐步扩大、发展的。他们在学生中进行技术排队时，发觉这些农家子弟大都会一些家庭副业技能，许多学生会编蒲包、打草鞋，这方面的原料和销路都没有问题，他们就首先建立蒲包、草鞋工场。现在，利港、申港和西石桥农业中学的副业已有编织蒲包、芦菲、草包，打草鞋，做农具，替公社搞缝纫加工等多种。此外，还有饲养业和养蚕业。在条件困难的情况下，公社党委给以支持也是必要的。西石桥农业中学的生产资金中有24％是公社支援的。不少农业中学都在因地制宜地研究生产布局。开始时，以副业和高产经济作物为主，以便打下自给的经济基础；在农业生产方面，适应农业中学学生年龄小的特点，以少种高产为主，争取成为农村高额丰产的旗帜。
    农业中学的生产自给，是为了巩固农业中学和提高教学质量。许多公社党委和农业中学的领导对这一点都已逐步明确起来。在计划生产自给的同时，各农业中学对生产劳动和教学的时间都作了妥善安排。一般是上午上课，早上一小时和晚上两小时自修，下午五小时是劳动。星期日半天劳动，半天休息。在农忙季节，必要时全天劳动；在阴雨天，除室内副业照常生产外，其余的人全天教学。
    为了保证教学质量的提高，农业中学给教师们安排了充分的自学、备课、批改作业的时间。利港等农业中学规定教师在一周内，除了上午教课和两个下午参加劳动外，其余时间由教师自己安排备课、批改作业和自学。利港农业中学的教师们经常到利港普通中学去听课，向普通中学教师学习。他们还和普通中学教师共同成立教研组，经常交流教学经验，商讨提高教学质量的问题。这学期各科的考试成绩比上学期有显著进步。马镇农业中学一年级，四十九人的语文平均七十二点八分，比上学期语文总平均六十三分增加九点八分。
    江苏省各级党委对农业中学的生产自给很关心。中共江苏省委书记处书记陈光同志和教育厅长等人今年3月以来，在不到三个月的时间内，曾经两次深入农业中学，和教师、学生、家长以及公社干部座谈，了解农业中学生产自给的情况，帮助他们研究问题，促进农业中学的生产和教学的高涨。各公社党委认清了办好农业中学的意义，选派了一些社、队干部到农业中学当校长或副校长，帮助农业中学加强生产管理。有的公社还选派了一部分老农和技工到农业中学指导生产技术。不少公社把产、供、销没有问题、体力劳动强度不大的副业门路，介绍给农业中学，帮助农业中学创造生产自给的条件。
    江阴县的经验证明，农业中学的生产自给，对巩固农业中学起了重要作用。既减轻了生产队和学生家长的负担，使干部、家长拥护，教师、学生教学安心；又在教学上把劳动和教学统一安排，使教学和劳动更加紧密结合，大大丰富了教学内容；学生经过劳动实践，书本知识也比较容易巩固。目前许多农业中学既是农村文化革命的一面旗帜，也是稻麦高产试验的先行。这里将为农村机械化和电气化培养出大批初级技术人材。（附图片）
