Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 12th: According to TASS, the Athens Military Tribunal continues to try the Greek national hero Glezos and other Greek patriots.

During the evening of July 10th and the proceedings of July 11th, the defendants' lawyers interrogated the plaintiff's witness, police officer Papaspyropoulos.

In answering questions from the defendants' lawyers, the plaintiff's witness, Papaspyropoulos's explanations of his testimony exposed the falsity of the accusation that Glezos and other defendants were engaged in "espionage." When the defendants' lawyers raised various questions and requested to cite even one specific fact, Papaspyropoulos either gave a negative answer or simply did not answer at all, only repeating the absurd claim that "international communism" was hostile to Greece.

One of the defendants' lawyers said to the plaintiff's witness that, based on his answers, one could conclude that the political police bureau had no concrete proof of the defendants engaging in espionage, such as collecting and sending intelligence. The plaintiff's witness replied: "Yes, there is no such proof" (commotion and laughter in the courtroom). The presiding judge then ordered the plaintiff's witness not to answer the question, saying, "The members of our military tribunal believe you," and then he asked the audience not to express their opinions on the plaintiff's witness's testimony.

Police officer Papaspyropoulos, acting as the plaintiff's witness, insisted that the Greek Communist Party trained spies in the Soviet Union in order to send them to Greece. He presented a photograph of a young man that had been published some time ago in the "Daily News" as "material evidence," saying that this young man appeared to be wearing a military school uniform and was a member of the Greek Communist Party. The defendant's lawyer Iliou told the court that this was the uniform of a technical school for training experts in the metallurgical industry.

The defendants' lawyers powerfully exposed the accusation that Glezos was an "accomplice in espionage." Everyone knows that this false accusation is based on the assertion that in mid-August 1958, Glezos met with Koliogiannis, a representative of the Greek Communist Party who allegedly illegally entered Greece to engage in "espionage," at his sister's house. The indictment and the plaintiff's witness's testimony also cited detailed records of this meeting in order to give the impression that the police authorities really knew about this meeting.

However, Papaspyropoulos's answers to the questions raised by Glezos's lawyers on July 11th showed that these "facts" were actually things "concocted by the police authorities." Even Papaspyropoulos admitted that during those days when it was believed that Glezos was going to meet with Koliogiannis, he constantly monitored the back of Glezos's sister's house, but did not see Glezos enter the house. The defendants' lawyers asked what was the basis for the political police bureau's insistence that Glezos had met with Koliogiannis? The plaintiff's witness, at a loss for words, replied that Koliogiannis "should" have met with Glezos because Glezos was the secretary of the United Democratic Left party.

Glezos protested the slanderous attacks against him by the presiding judge of the court and the plaintiff's witness. He told everyone that "witness" Papaspyropoulos had interrogated him. Glezos said, "I asked Papaspyropoulos at the time what he was writing down, and he replied that he was preparing the case according to Law No. 375."

This shows that the military tribunal's decision to allow Papaspyropoulos to act as the plaintiff's witness was in violation of the Greek Penal Code, which stipulates that anyone who has participated in the investigation of any case cannot act as the plaintiff's witness in the same case.

The trial continues.

At the same time, the wave of demands from all over Greece for the military tribunal to stop the shameful trial of Glezos and other democrats is rising daily. Industrialists and workers, farmers and merchants, handicraftsmen, and scientific and cultural workers from Athens, Piraeus, Thessaloniki, Crete, Corfu, and other places have written letters or sent telegrams to the King of Greece, the Prime Minister, and newspapers, demanding the restoration of Glezos's freedom.

### 格列索斯抗议法庭恶意诽谤  “原告证人”在质询下窘态毕露狼狈不堪

    格列索斯抗议法庭恶意诽谤
    “原告证人”在质询下窘态毕露狼狈不堪
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社雅典讯：雅典军事法庭继续审讯希腊民族英雄格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者。
    在10日晚上和11日的审讯中，被告辩护人对原告证人、警官帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯进行质问。
    原告证人帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯在回答被告辩护律师们的问题时对自己的证词的说明，暴露了控告格列索斯和其他被告从事“间谍活动”的虚伪性。当被告的辩护人提出各个问题和请求援用那怕是一件具体事实时，帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯不是作否定的回答，就是根本不回答，他只是一味重复关于“国际共产主义”敌视希腊的无稽之谈。
    一位被告辩护人向原告证人说，根据他的回答可以得出一个结论：政治警察局没有关于被告进行间谍活动，例如收集和发送情报等等的具体证明。原告证人回答说：对，没有这些证明（场内骚动、哄笑）。庭长这时命令原告证人不要回答问题，并且说：“我们军事法庭的成员相信您”，然后他要求听众不要对原告证人的证词表示自己的看法。
    充当原告证人的警官帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯硬说，希腊共产党在苏联训练间谍，以便把他们投入希腊。他向法庭提出了一些时候以前曾在“每日新闻”上登载过的一个青年人的照片作为“物证”，说这个青年人似乎穿着军校学生服，而且是希腊共产党党员。被告辩护律师伊利乌向法庭说，这是为冶金工业培养专家的技术学校的制服。
    被告的辩护律师们有力地揭露了诬蔑格列索斯为“间谍活动同谋犯”的控告。大家都知道，这个诬告是以这样一种论断为根据的，这个论断说什么在1958年8月中旬，格列索斯在他姐姐家里会见了所谓非法进入希腊进行“间谍活动”的希腊共产党代表科里雅尼斯。在上诉书和原告证人的供词中还援引了这次会见的详细纪录，以便给人一种印象，似乎警察当局真的知道了这次会见。
    但是，帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯11日对格列索斯的辩护人提出的问题的回答表明，这些“事实”原来是“警察当局臆想”出来的东西。连帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯也承认，在以为格列索斯要同科里雅尼斯会见的那些天里，他不断在格列索斯姐姐的房子后面监视，但是，没有看见格列索斯进入这所房子。被告的辩护律师们问，政治警察局硬说格列索斯会见了科里雅尼斯的根据是什么？原告证人理屈词穷地回答说，科里雅尼斯“应当”会见格列索斯，因为格列索斯是统一民主左翼党的书记。
    格列索斯抗议法庭庭长和原告证人对他进行的诽谤攻击。他对大家说，“证人”帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯审讯过他。格列索斯说，“我当时问帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯在记些什么，他回答说，在根据第三百七十五号法律准备案件。”
    由此可见，军事法庭让帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯作原告证人的决定是违反希腊刑法法典的，这个法典规定，参加过任何一件案件侦察工作的人，都不能作同一案件的原告证人。
    审讯继续进行。
    与此同时，希腊各地要求军事法庭停止对格列索斯和其他民主人士进行可耻的审讯的浪潮日益高涨。雅典、比里犹斯、萨罗尼加、克里特、科孚等地的工业家和工人、农民和商人、手工业者、科学和文化工作者纷纷写信或者打电报给希腊国王、首相和报刊，要求恢复格列索斯的自由。（附图片）
