Defending Glezos is Upholding Justice!
Vice-Chairman of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers
Vice-President of the China Political Science and Law Association Shen Junru

Currently, kind-hearted people worldwide are focusing their attention on the Greek authorities' persecution of the Greek national hero Glezos and other patriots, and closely monitoring the development of the event. This is a struggle between justice and injustice, truth and evil, and also a struggle to win democracy for Greece and safeguard peace in the Balkans.

Kind-hearted people have gained rich experience in political life: it can be said that every international conspiracy case in recent years is closely related to US imperialism. Just as US imperialism is about to build US military rocket bases on Greek territory, to use Greece as a stronghold for attacking the socialist camp and suppressing the national liberation movements of countries in the Middle East and Near East, to further enslave the Greek people and tie Greece to the chariot of US imperialism, at this time, Glezos, the outstanding son of the Greek people, was pushed onto the defendant's seat in the Athens military court by the Greek authorities on trumped-up charges. The political purpose of persecuting Glezos is so obvious.

It is no accident that the Greek authorities fabricated charges against Glezos and framed him. The Greek authorities are doing their best to implement US imperialism's war policy. Glezos, who resisted fascist aggression and defended national independence during the Nazi occupation of Greece, would never allow US imperialism to replace the Nazi aggressors today, to arrange Greece's national economy according to the aggressive interests of US imperialism, to command Greece's armed forces, and to guide Greece's foreign policy. The activities of Glezos and other patriots embody the will of the Greek people. This makes the Greek authorities, who have let the wolf into the house, inevitably feel fear. Although the Greek authorities, who are oppressing the people, are attempting to persecute Glezos, suppress democratic forces, and clear the way for further implementation of US imperialism's war policy, the will of Greek patriots is inviolable, as Glezos said in his letter to Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis:

"This will not work." This is also an unchangeable conclusion. The fact of the persecution of Glezos only proves how much the Greek authorities fear the will of patriots!

The Greek authorities' reliance on Law No. 375 to persecute Glezos is a reactionary law formulated during the fascist rule. The Greek people generally recognize that "it violates the Greek constitution," and a proposal to abolish this law has been submitted in the Greek parliament. The Greek authorities allow the fascist law that violates the Greek constitution to exist and continue to poison Greek patriots, which is intolerable.

According to the provisions of the Greek Criminal Code, anyone who has participated in the investigation of any case cannot be a plaintiff witness in the same case. The Greek authorities abandoned this provision and openly allowed police officers from the political police bureau to serve as plaintiff witnesses. If such a plaintiff witness can still play the role of a "witness," it can only further prove the political purpose of persecuting Glezos. This is one aspect. Secondly, the qualification of a witness should first be based on the facts in hand to testify, but the plaintiff witnesses who accused Glezos could not cite a single fact accusing Glezos, and even had to admit in court that "there is no proof of these" and that it was based on "the police authorities' conjecture," etc. From these testimonies of the plaintiff witnesses, it can only be further proven that Glezos is innocent.

Glezos is innocent. Even former Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris said: "Not a word in the accusation against Glezos is true." Former Greek Minister of Social Security Mercouris also said: The accusation against Glezos on charges of "espionage" "cannot withstand any criticism." The Greek authorities' persecution of Glezos has no real legal basis other than naked political purposes. The Greek authorities' arbitrary conviction is a gross insult to human justice and a despicable mockery of the dignity of the law, proving that the Greek judicial organs not only cannot guarantee the democratic rights of Greek patriots, but have degenerated into a tool serving the war policy of US imperialism. It must be pointed out: the Greek authorities are guilty of doing this. The persecution of patriots itself constitutes a crime. In particular, the prosecutor of the Greek court once listed Glezos's heroic act of tearing down the Nazi flag eighteen years ago as a "crime" in a trial, and slandered it as a "despicable and shameful crime," which clearly shows that the Greek authorities are replacing the Nazi aggressors in trying the Greek national hero. History will forever record the shameful conspiracy of the Greek authorities to persecute Glezos!

As a heroic patriot and staunch peace fighter, Glezos's entire activities are to contribute to the cause of peace, democracy, and progress for mankind. Glezos's glorious name belongs to the Greek people and also to the people of the world. We Chinese people regard Glezos's heroic deeds as the glory of mankind and a model to learn from. When Glezos was imprisoned and tried by the Greek authorities, we Chinese people, together with the people of the world, deeply cared about Glezos's fate and strongly protested the Greek authorities' persecution of Glezos. The fact is obvious, if the Greek authorities dare to frame the Greek national hero, then who else in Greece cannot be persecuted by the Greek authorities? If the Greek authorities dare to slander the heroic deeds of resisting the Nazi aggressors as a "despicable and shameful crime," then what dignity of mankind cannot be desecrated by the Greek authorities? This makes the people of the world understand even more the justice of defending Glezos and the importance of defending the cause of peace, democracy, and progress. The Greek authorities should correctly recognize the just condemnation of the people of the world and consider the strength it represents: "public anger is hard to resist"! We demand that the Greek authorities withdraw their poisonous hands from persecuting Glezos and other patriots, and immediately return the freedom of Glezos and other patriots!

    保卫格列索斯就是伸张正义！
    国际民主法律工作者协会副主席
    中国政治法律学会副会长  沈钧儒
    现在，全世界善良的人们都在集中注意希腊当局迫害希腊民族英雄格列索斯和其他爱国者的事件，而且密切注意事件的发展。这是一场正义与非正义、真理与邪恶的斗争，也是争取希腊的民主和维护巴尔干地区的和平的斗争。
    善良的人们在政治生活中已经得到丰富的经验：凡是近年来的国际阴谋案件，可以说每一件都与美帝国主义有密切的关系。正当美帝国主义要在希腊的领土上建立美军的火箭基地，要把希腊作为进攻社会主义阵营、镇压中近东各国民族解放运动的据点，要进一步奴役希腊人民、把希腊缚在美帝国主义的战车上，这时候，希腊人民的优秀儿子格列索斯，竟被希腊当局以莫须有的罪名，推上了雅典军事法庭的被告席。迫害格列索斯的政治目的，就是这样的明显。
    希腊当局对于格列索斯罗织罪名，进行构陷，绝不是偶然的。希腊当局是以执行美帝国主义的战争政策为能事的。曾经在纳粹侵略者侵占希腊的时期，反抗法西斯侵略、维护民族独立的格列索斯，断不容许今天美帝国主义代替纳粹侵略者，按照美帝国主义的侵略利益来安排希腊的国民经济，指挥希腊的武装力量，指导希腊的外交政策的。格列索斯等爱国者的活动体现了希腊人民的意志。这样，也就使引狼入室的希腊当局，不能不有所恐惧。尽管残民以逞的希腊当局妄图迫害格列索斯，镇压民主势力，为进一步执行美帝国主义的战争政策扫清道路，但是，希腊爱国者的意志是最不可侮的，正如格列索斯在给希腊首相卡拉曼利斯的信中所说：
  “这是不会行得通的”。这也就是不可改变的结论。迫害格列索斯的事实只不过证明，希腊当局对于爱国者的意志是何等恐惧！
    希腊当局迫害格列索斯所援引的三七五号法律是法西斯统治时期制订的反动法律，希腊人民公认
  “它是违反希腊宪法的”，在希腊议会里已经提出废除这项法律的提案。希腊当局竟使违反希腊宪法的法西斯法律存在，而且使它继续荼毒希腊爱国者，这是不能令人容忍的。
    按希腊刑法法典的规定，参加过任何一件案件侦察工作的人，都不能作同一案件的原告证人。希腊当局抛弃了这样的规定，公然由政治警察局的警官充当原告证人。这样的原告证人如果说还能起“证人”的作用，只能进一步证明迫害格列索斯的政治目的。这是一个方面。其次，作为证人的资格，首先应根据掌握的事实作证，但是，控告格列索斯的原告证人，竟举不出一件控告格列索斯的事实，甚至对簿法庭时，也只好供认“没有这些证明”、出于“警察当局的臆想”等等。从原告证人的这些证词里又只能进一步证明格列索斯的无罪。
    格列索斯是清白无罪的。连希腊前首相曹达利斯都说：“在对格列索斯的控告中，没有一个字是真话。”希腊前社会保安部长麦尔库里斯也说：以“间谍活动”罪名对格列索斯的诬告，是“经不起任何批驳的”。希腊当局对于格列索斯的迫害，除了赤裸裸的政治目的以外，是没有真正法律根据的。希腊当局妄入人罪，是对人类正义的粗暴侮辱，也是对法律尊严的卑劣嘲弄，证明希腊的司法机关不但不能保障希腊爱国者民主权利，反而堕落成为美帝国主义的战争政策服务的工具了。必须指出：希腊当局这样做是有罪的。迫害爱国者的事件本身，已经构成了犯罪。特别是希腊法庭的检察官曾经在一次审讯中，把格列索斯在十八年前扯下纳粹旗帜的英雄事迹也列为“罪状”，并诬蔑为“卑鄙可耻的罪行”，已经清楚地说明希腊当局在代替纳粹侵略者来审讯希腊的民族英雄了。历史将永远记下希腊当局迫害格列索斯的可耻阴谋！
    作为英勇的爱国者和坚强的和平战士，格列索斯的全部活动是为了对人类的和平、民主和进步事业作出贡献。格列索斯的光辉的名字是属于希腊人民的，也是属于全世界人民的。我们中国人民把格列索斯的英雄事迹引为人类的光荣，当作学习的榜样。当格列索斯受到希腊当局的监禁和审讯时，我们中国人民同全世界人民一起，深切关怀格列索斯的命运，严重抗议希腊当局对格列索斯的迫害。事实很明显，希腊当局敢于构陷希腊的民族英雄，那么，在希腊还有什么人不可以被希腊当局横加迫害？希腊当局敢于把反抗纳粹侵略者的英雄事迹诬为“卑鄙可耻的罪行”，那么，人类还有什么尊严不可以被希腊当局横加渎亵？这样，也就使全世界人民更加懂得保卫格列索斯的正义性，更加懂得保卫和平、民主和进步事业的重要性。希腊当局应当正确认识全世界人民的正义谴责，而且考虑到它所代表的力量“众怒难犯”！我们要求希腊当局收回迫害格列索斯和其他爱国者的毒手，立即还格列索斯和其他爱国者的自由！
