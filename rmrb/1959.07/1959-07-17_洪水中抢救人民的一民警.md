A Policeman Rescues People in the Flood
By our reporters Chen Yi and Yang Wencuan

The dyke collapsed… The turbid flood, like a caged beast, rushed towards the south bank of the East River and the streets of Huiyang County, Guangdong Province. People shouted and ran, rushing home to move their belongings. Chen Yi, a policeman who was rescuing the dyke, saw that the dyke could not be saved. He immediately left the breach and rushed to the low-lying residential areas around Xiushui Lake and Shangxi Lake. The women and children in the Xiushui Lake area, who were eating breakfast, had not had time to pack their belongings when the water had already submerged their thighs. In a low house at the turning of Zhu Zi Lane, a middle-aged woman, Liu Yongchang, was carrying an infant less than three months old on her back, standing in the water trying to salvage things. Her husband had not returned, and she had to carry the baby on her back and carry things. How could she swim out? She was so anxious that her eyes were blank and tears were streaming down her face. At this moment, Chen Yi, a policeman who was driving a small boat with everyone else to carry people and transport goods, jumped in front of her. He quickly helped Liu Yongchang tie up her clothes and quilts, and carried her from the flood, which was almost up to her neck, to the boat.

What Chen Yi was most worried about at that time was the 78-year-old woman, Zeng Weijing, at No. 20 Liujiao Lane. Because he had urged her several times to move by boat, she was always unwilling to leave the house where she had lived for more than 20 years. The more Chen Yi thought about it, the more anxious he became, so he turned the boat around and rushed to Liujiao Lane. He saw that the water had risen to the attic floor, and the boat could no longer enter through the gate. Chen Yi quickly rowed the boat to the back of the house, stepped on the window opening, and took her onto the boat, holding her hands.

In this way, Chen Yi went back and forth in the water, working until more than 3:00 in the afternoon, at which time his face gradually turned pale and his lips turned blue. But when Li Ying, a woman trapped in the water, handed her three-year-old child to him, he still gritted his teeth and took the mother and child to a safe place. When the cadre Zhang Zhong saw him like this, he persuaded Chen Yi, "You can't hold on any longer, go back and rest!" "It's okay, I can still hold on!" Chen Yi insisted. "Then put on my raincoat!" Zhang Zhong took off his raincoat and was about to hand it to Chen Yi. "It's not convenient to move in the water wearing a raincoat!" He said and rushed to the deepest residential area. He completely forgot that he had not eaten or drunk for 20 hours, and he also forgot that he had stomach and lung diseases.

"Chen Yi, go back quickly, how can your illness..." Xu Zhenqiang, the director of the Qiaoxi Police Station, had already sent someone to look for Chen Yi to go back, but he couldn't find him several times. At this moment, when he saw him rowing a boat to send people to the front of the Xihu Department Store, he stopped him. "No, I can't go back!" Chen Yi stood in waist-deep water like the director and replied quickly. The director was anxious and urged Chen Yi to go back again. Chen Yi turned around and jumped onto the boat again, rowing desperately.

It was getting dark, the wind was howling, and the rain was still falling. Chen Yi continued to patrol everywhere in a small boat, looking for residents who had not yet escaped. It was dawn again, the rain had not stopped, and the water was still rising. Chen Yi persisted in the flood until dusk, when the director of the residents' committee told him that there were several households in the house at No. 18 Xiangling Port. They originally thought that the terrain was high and the water would never reach it, and the four-layer partition wall was very strong, so they had not left. But now it was not possible. Chen Yi hurriedly rowed the boat to the front of the house. When he looked at it, the water was only half a meter away from the top of the gate, and several households lived in the innermost part of the courtyard. He had to cross three doors to get in. In his anxiety, he immediately lay down at the bottom of the boat, supported the top of the door with his right hand, and pushed hard to pass through the gate. After rescuing an old woman in the first room, he tried his best to row into the third door to rescue the twenty or so people. But the boat could not turn around. He turned around without hesitation, and took advantage of the fact that the water had not sealed the door, and quickly sent the rescued old woman out. Then, he turned over and plunged into the water again, swimming to the last few rooms in the courtyard, finding the old people and children huddled together on a small floor, crying and shouting. He swam back and forth, looking around, and discussed a solution with the old man trapped in the house by the water. Finally, he found a way out: demolish the back wall, climb onto the roof of the neighboring house, and then cross over to a place where the boat could reach. He swam out to the street, and organized several people who knew how to swim to rescue people according to this plan. At this time, he was exhausted and lay limply, unable to move.

For two days and two nights, Chen Yi, a policeman from a poor peasant family and a probationary member of the Communist Party of China, rescued more than 100 residents from danger. In this lowest residential area in the city, no one was drowned due to the efforts of him, the street cadres, and the People's Liberation Army.

Now, Huiyang County has fully resumed production, and the residents are living a new life of struggle. However, people cannot forget one thing: that is, how the policeman Chen Yi rescued himself from the turbulent flood. (Attached picture)

    洪水中抢救人民的一民警
    本报记者　陈逸　杨文全
    堤崩了……。浑浊的洪水，好比脱笼的野兽，朝向东江南岸，广东省惠阳县城的大街上猛扑过来。人们喊着、跑着，赶回家去搬东西。正在抢救堤防的人民警察陈仪，这时看到堤岸已无法挽救，立即离开堤坝缺口，急忙向秀水湖、上西湖一带低洼的居民区奔去。正在吃早饭的秀水湖一带的妇女、孩子们，还没来得及收拾家当，水已淹过大腿了。朱紫巷拐弯处的一座矮房子里，中年妇女刘咏嫦正背着一个出生不到三个月的婴儿，站在水中抢收东西。她的丈夫没回来，自己背上婴儿又要扛东西，怎么能泅的出去？只急得她两眼发呆，眼泪直淌。这时，和大伙儿一起，四处驾着小艇正在载人运物的人民警察陈仪，一闪身跳到她的面前来。他七手八脚几下子就帮助刘咏嫦把衣服、棉被捆好，从快要深到脖子的洪水里将她送到小艇。陈仪当时最耽心的是六角巷二十号那个七十八岁的曾维敬老太太。因为他一连催她几次叫她乘船转移，她老是不愿离开自己住了二十多年的屋子。陈仪越惦念越焦急，便拨转船头，又飞驰到六角巷。只见水涨到阁板了，船已不能从大门进去，陈仪就赶紧把小艇划到屋后，他一脚踏上窗洞，拉着她的双手，将她接到艇上来。就这样，陈仪水里来，水里去，一直干到下午三点多钟，这时，他已渐渐变得脸色苍白，嘴唇青紫了。但当被困在水里的妇女黎英把三岁的孩子交到他手上的时候，他仍咬紧牙关，一直把母亲孩子送到安全地带去。干部张忠见他这样，便劝陈仪说：“你支持不下去了，回去休息吧！”“行，还能抗得住！”陈仪坚持说。“那你披上我这件雨衣吧！”张忠从自己身上脱下雨衣要递给陈仪。“披着雨衣在水里活动不方便！”他说罢又冲往水最深的居民点去了。他完全忘记了自己已经二十个钟头没吃饭、没喝水了，也忘记了自己还患有胃病和肺病。“陈仪，赶快回去，你的病怎么能……”桥西派出所所长徐振强早就派人找陈仪回去，几次都找不到，此刻一看见他正划船送人往西湖百货大厦门前时，便叫住他。“不，我不能回去！”陈仪和所长一样站在齐腰深的水里急促地回答。所长急了，又催陈仪回去。陈仪又一扭身跳上小艇，拼命划着船走了。
    天黑了，狂风呼呼地刮着，雨仍然下个不停。陈仪继续划着一条小艇，到处巡逻，去找寻那些尚未脱险的居民。天又亮了，雨还未停，水仍继续上涨着。陈仪在洪流里坚持到挨近黄昏时，居民委员会主任告诉他象岭港十八号那幢房子里有几户人家，原以为地势高，水从来淹不到，而且四层夹墙挺坚固，所以一直不走，可是如今不行了。陈仪急忙划着艇赶到那屋前，一看水离大门顶上只差半米，几户人家都住在院子的最里面，要越过三道门才能进得去。他情急智生，立刻卧倒在艇底，右手托着门顶，用力一撑，穿过了大门。在第一间房子里，把一个老太太救出来以后，他还竭力想划进第三道门，去救那二十几个人。可是小艇拐不过弯。他毫不迟疑地掉转头来，趁水未封门，把已救出的那个老太太赶紧送出去。然后，他翻过身又扑入水中，潜游到院子里最后的几个房间，找着挤在一块小楼板上又哭又叫的老人和小孩。他游来游去的张望着，又跟被水困在房子里的老爷爷商量办法，终于找到了一条出路：拆掉后墙，攀上邻房的屋顶，再越到能靠船的地方去。他潜水出到大街上，又组织了几个识水性的人按这计划把人救出，这时候，他已经筋疲力竭，四肢软绵绵地躺着不能动弹了。一连两天两夜，这位贫农出身的人民警察、中共预备党员陈仪抢救了一百多个居民脱离险境。这个全城最低的居民区，在他和街道干部、人民解放军的努力下，没淹死一个人。
    现在，惠阳县城已经全面恢复生产，居民们又过着新的战斗的生活了。可是，人们不能忘记一件事：那就是人民警察陈仪如何在湍急的洪水中抢救自己出险的往事。（附图片）
