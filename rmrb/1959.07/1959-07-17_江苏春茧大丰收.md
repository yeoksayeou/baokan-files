Jiangsu Province has achieved an all-round bumper harvest of spring cocoons this year, laying a solid foundation for a greater leap forward in total cocoon production for the year.

This year, Jiangsu Province distributed 290,000 sheets of spring silkworm eggs, an increase of 23.17% over the same period last year. They were raised in five batches. After more than a month of hard work by the vast number of cadres and commune members in the silkworm areas, the first, second, and third batches of 273,000 sheets of silkworm eggs have achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest, yielding more than 63,000 dan of cocoons, an increase of 21.8% over the total output of spring cocoons last year. The average yield of cocoons per sheet of silkworm eggs was 60 jin, an increase of 5.86% over the average yield per sheet of spring cocoons last year, exceeding the highest average yield per sheet since the founding of the country. Among them, 1,455 sheets of silkworm eggs broke the "100-jin cocoon" mark, an increase of 40 times compared with the number of "100-jin cocoons" in spring silkworms last year. Currently, the fourth and fifth batches of spring silkworms are either in the process of dormancy or have already started spinning cocoons, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

The quality of this year's spring cocoons is also much better than in previous years. The characteristics are: large cocoons, thick cocoon layers, long silk threads, and high reeling rate. This has been proven by the inspection and measurement of the national purchasing departments and the actual performance of silk mills.

The bumper harvest of spring cocoons has brought smiles to the faces of the silkworm farmers who have worked hard all winter and spring. They say that this is the "fourth bumper harvest" already in hand, following the three major bumper harvests of wheat, rapeseed, and green manure this year. Yuan Fuxiang, an old silkworm farmer in Xinan Brigade of Taihu Commune in Wuxi County who has been raising silkworms for more than 40 years, raised two sheets of spring silkworms this year, with an average yield of 115 jin per sheet. He happily told everyone he met: "I have never seen such good cocoons in my entire life."

The commune members of the people's communes in the vast silkworm areas are happily selling new cocoons to the state. So far, more than 141,000 dan of the first, second, and third batches of spring cocoons have been purchased, exceeding the total purchase volume of spring cocoons last year by 13.5%. Purchases are still continuing in various places. (Attached picture)

    江苏春茧大丰收
    江苏省今年春茧获得全面大丰收，为全年蚕茧生产的更大跃进奠定了坚实的基础。
    江苏省今年春蚕共发种二十九万张，比去年同期增加23.17％。前后共分五批饲养。经过蚕区广大干部和社员一个多月的辛勤劳动，第一、二、三批二十七万三千张蚕种已经全面丰收，共采茧六万三千多担，比去年全部春茧的总产量增长21.8％；平均每张蚕种的产茧量为六十斤，比去年春茧平均张产增长5.86％，超过了建国以来平均张产的最高水平。其中有一千四百五十五张蚕种突破了“百斤茧”大关，比去年春蚕“百斤茧”的张数增加了四十倍。目前，四、五两批春蚕，有的正在大眠，有的已上簇结茧，丰收在望。
    今年春茧的质量也比往年好得多。特点是：茧子大，茧层厚，丝缕长，上车率高。这从国家收购部门的检验测定和丝厂缫丝的实绩中得到证明。
    春茧大丰收，使苦战一冬春的蚕农们，个个笑逐颜开。他们说，这是在今年三麦、油菜、绿肥三大丰收之后，已经到手的
  “第四个大丰收”。无锡县太湖公社溪南大队养了四十多年蚕的老蚕农袁福祥，今年饲养的两张春茧，平均张产一百一十五斤。他高兴得逢人便说：“我这一辈子，从来没有看到过这样好的蚕茧”。
    广大蚕区的人民公社的社员们，欢天喜地的向国家出售新茧。到目前为止，一、二、三批春茧已收购了十四万一千多担，超过了去年整个春茧收购量的13.5％。现在各地仍在继续收购中。（附图片）
