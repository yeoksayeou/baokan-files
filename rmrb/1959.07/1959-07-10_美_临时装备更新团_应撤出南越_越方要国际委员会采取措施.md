Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 8th: Hanoi newspapers reported today that Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, sent a telegram to the International Commission on the 4th, requesting the International Commission to take measures to force the U.S. "Temporary Equipment Replacement Group" to implement the International Commission's resolution requiring them to leave South Vietnam before June.

The telegram pointed out that last December, the International Commission made a resolution stating that the U.S. "Temporary Equipment Replacement Group" must leave South Vietnam before June this year, but so far no preparations or arrangements have been seen by the South Vietnamese authorities to withdraw the U.S. "Temporary Equipment Replacement Group."

The telegram said that obviously, the U.S. and the South Vietnamese authorities are trying to delay the matter, allowing the U.S. "Temporary Equipment Replacement Group" to stay in South Vietnam and refuse to withdraw. The telegram said that this behavior of the South Vietnamese authorities seriously violates Articles 16 and 19 of the Geneva Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam.

    美“临时装备更新团”应撤出南越
    越方要国际委员会采取措施
    新华社河内8日电　据河内报纸今天报道，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校4日打电报给国际委员会，要求国际委员会采取措施，迫使美国“临时装备更新团”执行国际委员会要求它们在6月以前撤离南越的决议。
    电报指出，去年12月，国际委员会作出决议说，美国“临时装备更新团”必须在今年6月以前离开南越，可是直到现在还没有看见南越当局为撤走美国“临时装备更新团”作任何准备和安排。
    电报说，显然，美国和南越当局企图在这个问题上拖延时间，让美国“临时装备更新团”赖在南越，不肯撤走。电报说，南越当局的这种行为严重地违反了日内瓦协议关于在越南停止敌对行动协定第十六和第十九条的规定。
