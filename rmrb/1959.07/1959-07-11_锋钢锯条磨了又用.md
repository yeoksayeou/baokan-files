    High-Speed Steel Saw Blades Sharpened and Reused
    Lao Yunhe, the material warehouse administrator of the Second Workshop of the Shanghai No. 5 Textile Machinery Factory, has recently created a high-speed steel saw blade sharpening machine. In the past, ordinary high-speed steel saw blades would become blunt after being used on a saw for five days, making them unusable and only fit to be piled up as waste. Now, with the sharpening machine, they can be used twice more after sharpening. In this way, one high-speed steel saw blade can be worth three. I think this practice is worth promoting.

    锋钢锯条磨了又用
    上海第五纺织机械厂第二车间，材料库管理员劳云鹤，最近创造了一部锋钢锯条磨齿机。过去，一般锋钢锯条，在锯床上用了五天以后就要变钝，不能再使用，只能当废品堆起来；现在有了磨齿机，经过磨齿可以多用两次。这样，一根锋钢锯条就可抵上三根用。我看，这种做法值得推广。
