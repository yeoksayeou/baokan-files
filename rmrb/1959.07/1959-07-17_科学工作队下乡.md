　　Science Work Teams Go to the Countryside
　　By Our Correspondent Wei Lingbing

　　One Sunday, we arrived at the small village of Brintino, dozens of miles from Bucharest. As soon as we entered the village, we heard lively and bright Gypsy music. Following the music, we found out that a Gypsy wedding was taking place. The wedding had already been going on for a day and a night. Hundreds of people crowded in the small courtyard, dancing folk dances and social dances.

　　At this moment of jubilation, the chairman of the village people's council announced, "The science work team is here!" Many people, upon hearing this news, stopped dancing and went to a large classroom in the elementary school. They wanted to set aside the revelry of the wedding dance and calmly discuss scientific issues with the science work team.

　　As soon as the science work team arrived in the village, they received a handful of notes with various questions that the farmers had prepared in advance. These questions ranged from childbirth to the launching of artificial satellites. In addition to answering these questions, the science work team also had to answer some questions that the farmers raised on the spot.

　　This science work team from Bucharest included a director of a cultural center, an agronomist, and a doctor. According to their division of labor, the director answered questions about political and social sciences, the agronomist answered agricultural questions and questions related to natural sciences, and the doctor, in addition to answering questions about medical and health issues, also had the duty to examine the farmers.

　　The science work team's activities began. First, Bazeșdei, the director of the cultural center, sat on the podium to answer questions. White-haired elderly people, women holding children, young men and women, and Young Pioneers all listened carefully to the explanation of the important international issue of the two Germanys. Some people even took notes seriously. Afterwards, the audience also asked many questions about revisionism and the political situation in the United States.

　　People raised some interesting questions to the science work team's agronomist, Wilzenia. For example, the Party branch secretary of a collective farm asked, "Our farm has a cow that gave birth to two calves in one litter. Is there any way to make all cows give birth to two calves in one litter?"

　　More and more questions were raised. One farmer asked eight questions in one breath. The science work team did not have time to answer all the questions and could only choose some questions of general interest to answer.

　　Finally, a female farm member said that she had seen in a book that there is a tree in China that can grow cotton, and she asked the science work team what kind of tree this was. The director of the cultural center glanced at us and replied easily, "Please ask the Chinese experts here to answer this question!" So the question was immediately shifted to us. Even after the meeting, some farmers still surrounded us in the courtyard and asked, "What methods do Chinese farmers use to obtain high yields?" "Does China grow more rice or corn?" "Does the Yellow River still flood?" Their thirst for knowledge and their concern for China moved us very much.

　　The above is just one of many science work teams.

　　Romania's science work teams are organized by the science popularization associations in various places with the support of the Party and the People's Council. The members include academicians of the Academy of Sciences, university professors, agricultural experts, journalists, doctors, Party and government workers, etc. Members are appointed by the science popularization association or the People's Council. Most of them are people with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. The work of the science work team is voluntary, and the members do not receive any remuneration.

　　A science work team consists of five to eight people. In many places, the personnel composition and work area of ​​the work team are fixed. For example, the seventy-eight work teams in Constanta Oblast maintain regular contact with certain villages respectively. In some areas, the work teams are composed of appropriate personnel according to the questions raised by the masses. Bucharest Oblast does it this way.

　　The work of the science work team is closely related to the current political and economic tasks. In addition to imparting scientific knowledge and agricultural technology according to the specific needs of the masses, they also actively publicize the policies and resolutions of the Party and the government to the masses, and explain major international issues. Therefore, the science work team plays a significant role in promoting the masses to implement the Party's policies, complete production tasks, and improve the political and scientific level of farmers.

　　The activities of the science work team are diversified. Sometimes they answer questions at meetings, and sometimes they talk with the masses. For some major issues, they sometimes give special reports and sometimes discuss with the masses. The masses are very interested in these methods and do not feel restrained at all. In many places, after the activities of the science work team end, there are also cultural and recreational activities, which further increases the attractiveness of the science work team.

　　Romania's first science work team appeared five years ago. Now this organization has spread throughout the country. Not only do the oblasts have them, but many counties and even villages have also organized their own science work teams. Recently, some places have also organized science work teams to work in industrial and mining enterprises. The science work teams in various places are becoming more and more active. For example, in Bacău Oblast, sixteen teams go to the countryside every Sunday to work. In Iași Oblast, more than one hundred academicians of the Academy of Sciences, agronomists, and doctors, etc., participated in this work within two months.

　　Facts have proved that the science work team is very popular with the masses. In popularizing scientific knowledge and carrying out political propaganda, this is a very lively and effective way of working that can adapt to the needs of the masses. (Attached picture)

### 科学工作队下乡

    科学工作队下乡
    本报记者　魏凌冰
    一个星期天，我们到了离布加勒斯特数十里路的小村勃林蒂诺。我们一走进村子就听到奔放明快的吉卜赛音乐声。顺着乐声走去，才知道是一家茨冈人在举行婚礼。这婚礼已经继续一天一夜了。上百的人挤在不大的庭院里跳着民族舞和交际舞。
    正在这一片欢腾的时刻，乡人民会议主席通知大家说：“科学工作队来了！”许多人一听到这消息，舞也不跳了，都走到小学校的一个大教室里。他们要在这里按下婚礼舞会上的狂欢心情，平心静气地同科学工作队进行一次关于科学问题的探讨。
    科学工作队一到达村里，就收到了一大把字条，上面写着农民事先提出的各种问题。在这些问题中，从生孩子到人造卫星上天样样都有。科学工作队除去要解答这些问题外，还要回答农民临时提出的一些问题。
    这个来自布加勒斯特市的科学工作队包括一个文化馆馆长、一个农学家和一个医生。按照他们的分工，这位馆长解答关于政治和社会科学方面的问题，农学家解答农业问题和有关自然科学的问题，医生除去解答关于医疗卫生的问题外，还有义务给农民看看病。
    科学工作队的活动开始了。首先坐在讲台上解答问题的是文化馆馆长巴泽什戴。一个茨冈农民要求讲一讲关于两个德国的问题。在座的白发老人，抱着孩子的妇女、男女青年和少先队员都仔细听着关于这个重大国际问题的讲解。有些人还认真地做笔记。随后，听众还提了许多关于修正主义和美国的政治情况的问题。
    人们向科学工作队的农学家威尔泽尼亚提了一些有趣的问题。例如，集体农庄的党支部书记问道：“我们农庄有一头母牛一胎生了两头小牛，有没有办法使所有的母牛都一胎生两头小牛？”
    问题越提越多，有个农民一口气就提了八个问题。科学工作队没有时间解答所有的问题，只能选择一些有普遍兴趣的问题来解答。
    最后，一个女庄员说，她在一本书上看到中国有一种树能结棉花，她问科学工作队这是一种什么树。文化馆馆长向我们瞧了一眼，轻松地回答说：“这个问题请在坐的中国专家回答吧！”于是问题一下就转移到我们身上了。直到散会后，还有些农民在院子里围着我们问：“中国农民用什么办法获得了高产？”“中国种水稻多还是种玉米多？”“黄河现在还闹不闹水灾？”他们渴求知识的精神和对中国的关怀使我们非常感动。
              ×　×　×
    上面介绍的只是许多科学工作队中的一个。
    罗马尼亚的科学工作队是由各地的科学普及协会在党和人民会议的支持下组织的。队员中包括科学院院士、大学教授、农业专家、新闻工作者、医生、党和政府工作人员等。队员是由科学普及协会或人民会议指派的。他们大多数都是既有理论知识又有实际经验的人。科学工作队的工作是一项义务劳动，队员不收任何报酬。
    科学工作队由五个人到八个人组成。在许多地方，工作队的人员组成和工作地区是固定的。例如康斯坦萨州的七十八个工作队分别同一定的乡保持经常联系。有些地区的工作队是根据群众所提出的问题选派适当的人员组成的，布加勒斯特州就是这样做的。
    科学工作队的工作是同当前的政治任务和经济任务密切联系的。他们除去根据群众的具体需要传授科学知识和农业技术外，还主动向群众宣传党和政府的政策和决议，讲解重大的国际问题。因此，科学工作队在推动群众执行党的政策，完成生产任务和提高农民的政治、科学水平方面起着很大作用。
    科学工作队的活动方式是多样化的，有时在会上解答问题，有时同群众交谈。对一些重大问题，有时作专题报告，有时同群众一起讨论。群众对这些方式都很有兴趣，一点也不感到拘束。许多地方在科学工作队的活动结束后，还进行文娱活动，这就更增加了科学工作队的吸引力。
    罗马尼亚的第一个科学工作队是在五年前出现的。现在这种组织已遍布全国，不但各州都有，在许多县、甚至乡也组织了自己的科学工作队。在最近有些地方还组织了到工矿企业活动的科学工作队。各地的科学工作队愈来愈活跃。例如巴克乌州每星期天都有十六个队到农村进行工作。雅西州在两个月内就有一百多名科学院院士、农学家和医生等参加了这项工作。
    事实证明，科学工作队是很受群众欢迎的。在普及科学知识、进行政治宣传方面，这是一种很能适应群众需要和最生动活泼的工作方式。（附图片）
