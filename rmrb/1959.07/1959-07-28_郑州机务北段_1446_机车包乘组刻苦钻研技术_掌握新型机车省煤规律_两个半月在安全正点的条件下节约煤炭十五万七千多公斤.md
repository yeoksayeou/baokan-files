This newspaper Zhengzhou, July 27th: The "Friendship" type 1446 locomotive youth crew of Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot North Section, after a period of diligent study, has worked out a set of experiences in saving coal on the "Friendship" type locomotive. This locomotive saved more than 157,400 kilograms of coal from the beginning of May to July 15 under safe and punctual conditions.
    This youth crew began using the "Friendship" type locomotive on April 1. This type of locomotive is a new locomotive added by the railway department. Its characteristics are: high boiler evaporation efficiency, good structural performance, large coal and water capacity, traction force 23% greater than the MN1 type locomotive, and equipped with advanced technological equipment such as coal feeders and water preheaters. When this crew started using this locomotive, they consumed a lot of coal because they could not master the new technology. In the first ten days of April alone, they wasted more than 30,000 kilograms of coal. However, when they used the MN1 type locomotive before, they were well-known coal savers in the entire section. In order to save coal for the country on the "Friendship" type locomotive, under the help of the locomotive depot's Party organization, they diligently studied the new technology, actively checked the causes of coal consumption, and looked for countermeasures. After many studies and experiments, they worked out a set of "Friendship" type locomotive operation and fire-burning technical operation methods. They did not waste coal when operating according to this method in mid-April. On this basis, they proposed further improvement measures, and by the end of April, they were able to save coal.
    Under the guidance of the idea that "a piece of coal is a piece of gold, a drop of water is a drop of oil," this crew, based on the characteristics of the "Friendship" type locomotive and the weak links in operation, found the following ways to save coal: (1) Cover the gaps in the rocking furnace rod on both sides of the fire door with iron covers, or block them with cotton, silk, or broken sacks to prevent coal from leaking from the gaps; (2) Wet the coal with water to prevent dry coal powder from being sent to the fire chamber and blown away by the wind; (3) Frequently shake the furnace fire slightly during the journey, instead of shaking it heavily and cleaning it thoroughly only at the station, so that half-burned coal is discharged into the ash box;
    (4) Adjust the coal supply of the coal feeder according to the longitudinal profile of the line. When running downhill with the steam cut off, manually add coal to avoid excessive coal supply from the coal feeder, which causes waste; (5) When adding coal manually, do not throw a full shovel of coal to avoid scattering; (6) Add coal according to the burning condition of the fire bed to prevent black smoke; (7) Do not let the safety valve emit steam, because emitting steam once wastes dozens of kilograms of coal; (8) Avoid opening the steam too violently, which wastes steam; (9) Keep the steam pressure and water at the specified standards to increase the locomotive's traction force; (10) Do not let coal smoke enter the cylinder or steam chamber to avoid damaging the oil film, forming smoke scale, and preventing scoring of the cylinder and steam chamber, which wastes coal and water; (11) The driver and stoker are responsible for frequently cleaning and oiling the friction parts of the locomotive to ensure flexible operation;
    (12) When going on and off duty, go to the laboratory to understand the water quality and correctly measure the water and medicine to achieve frequent and less frequent water discharge, so that the scale removal effect is good and the steam quality is high.
    In order to ensure that these coal-saving measures are thoroughly implemented, all members of the crew also achieved
    "Four Goods," "Three Cooperations," and "Two Preparations." The Four Goods are: good political and professional study, good acceptance of other people's experiences and lessons, good compliance with rules and regulations, and good rest. The Three Cooperations are: cooperation between shifts, cooperation between drivers and stokers, and cooperation between lookouts and stokers. The Two Preparations are: first, do a good job of preparation in the depot, prepare the furnace, moisten the coal, and test the coal feeder; second, prepare for steam shut-off, check the fire bed, maintain the fire, and achieve no steam drop when the steam is shut off.
    At the "Friendship" type locomotive experience exchange meeting recently held by the Ministry of Railways in Lanzhou, the driver of this locomotive introduced their experience to various places.
    Also reported: Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot North Section actively carries out coal-saving activities and promotes the operating experience of the "Friendship" type 1446 locomotive youth crew. From January to July 15, the entire section has saved more than 757,000 kilograms of coal for the country.
    Among the fifteen "Friendship" type locomotives dispatched by this section in April, only one could save coal; among the thirty "Friendship" type locomotives dispatched in June, twenty-three have saved coal. (Attached picture)

### 郑州机务北段1446机车包乘组刻苦钻研技术  掌握新型机车省煤规律  两个半月在安全正点的条件下节约煤炭十五万七千多公斤

    郑州机务北段1446机车包乘组刻苦钻研技术
    掌握新型机车省煤规律
    两个半月在安全正点的条件下节约煤炭十五万七千多公斤
    本报郑州27日电　郑州铁路局郑州机务北段“友好”型1446号机车青年包乘组，经过一段刻苦的钻研，摸索出一套在“友好”型机车上节约用煤的经验。这台机车在安全、正点的条件下，从5月初到7月15日节约煤炭十五万七千四百多公斤。
    这个青年包乘组从4月1日开始使用“友好”型机车。这种机车是铁路部门增加的新机车，它的特点是：锅炉蒸发效率高，构造性能好，煤、水容积大，牵引力比ㄇㄋ一型机车大23％，并且装有加煤机、给水预热器等先进技术设备。这个包乘组开始使用这种机车时，由于对新的技术掌握不住，耗煤很多，仅4月上旬就多费煤三万多公斤；他们以前使用ㄇㄋ一型机车时却是全段有名的省煤能手。为了在“友好”型机车上也能为国家节约煤炭，他们在机务段党组织的帮助下，刻苦地钻研新的技术，积极检查费煤的原因，寻找对策。经过多次研究和试验，他们摸索出了一套“友好”型机车操作和焚火技术作业方法。4月中旬按照这个方法操作，便不浪费煤了。在这个基础上，他们提出进一步的改进措施，到4月下旬便做到节省煤炭。
    这个包乘组在“一块煤一块金，一滴水一滴油”的思想支配下，根据“友好”型机车的特点和操作中的薄弱环节，找出的节约煤炭的办法是：（1）火门两边的摇炉杆的空隙，以铁罩盖住，或用棉丝、破麻包片堵塞，不让煤从缝里漏掉；（2）用水把煤润湿，以免干煤粉送到火室，被风吹跑；（3）在途中经常对炉火进行小的摇晃，而不是到站才大摇大清，使夹生煤泻入灰箱；
  （4）根据线路纵断面的情况，调整加煤机的给煤数量，在下坡绝气运转的时候，用人工补煤，免得加煤机给煤过多，造成浪费；（5）在人工加煤的时候，不满锨投煤，做到不抛撒；（6）根据火层燃烧情况加煤，防止冒黑烟；（7）不让安全阀冒汽，因冒一次汽就费几十公斤煤；（8）避免开汽过猛，损失蒸汽；（9）使汽压和水达到规定的标准，增加机车牵引力；（10）不使煤烟进入汽缸、汽室，以免破坏油膜，结成烟垢，并防止拉伤汽缸、汽室而费煤费水；（11）机车磨擦部分由司机、司炉分工负责经常清洗，加油，保证运行灵活；
  （12）出勤和退勤时，到化验室了解水质情况，正确量水下药，做到勤放水和少放水，这样排垢效果好，蒸汽质量高。
    全包乘组的人为了保证这些节约用煤的办法彻底实现，还做到了
  “四好”、“三协作”、“两准备”。四好是：政治业务学习好，接受别人的经验教训好，遵守规章制度好，休息好。三协作是：下班与上班协作，司机和焚火人员协作，了望人员和焚火人员协作。两准备是：首先做好库内准备，将炉整好，煤润好，加煤机试好；其次是做好关汽准备，检查火层，保持火势，达到关汽不掉汽。
    铁道部最近在兰州召开的“友好”型机车经验交流会上，这个机车的司机向各地介绍了他们的经验。
    又讯　郑州铁路局郑州机务北段积极开展节约用煤活动，推广“友好”型1446机车青年包乘组的操作经验，从1月到7月15日，全段已为国家节约煤炭七十五万七千多公斤。
    这个段4月份开出的十五台“友好”型机车中，只有一台能节约煤炭；6月份开出的三十台“友好”型机车中，节省了煤的已有二十三台。（附图片）
