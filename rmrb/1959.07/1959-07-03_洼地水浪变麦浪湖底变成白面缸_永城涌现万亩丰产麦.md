Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 2nd: Shuangqiao People's Commune in Yongcheng County, Henan Province, has diligently transformed its low-lying areas, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest of 16,017 mu of wheat in the low-lying and flood-prone Liuye Lake. After harvesting, threshing, and weighing, the average yield per mu reached 407 jin, an increase of 2.13 times compared to the average yield of 130 jin per mu in 1958.

Liuye Lake in Shuangqiao Commune includes the Twenty Li Pu, Eighteen Li, and Weizhuang brigades. It stretches twenty li east to west and two li north to south on the south bank of the Shan River. The terrain is low-lying and shaped like a long willow leaf. The soil in the lake is mostly red soil, which is neither drought-resistant nor flood-resistant. Every year, even one season of wheat could not be guaranteed. Before the establishment of advanced agricultural cooperatives, four to five thousand mu of land in the lake were barren and yielded nothing. Although all the land here was reclaimed after the establishment of advanced agricultural cooperatives in 1956, the disasters of floods and droughts were not eradicated. People held the belief that "planting depends on humans, harvesting depends on heaven," and cultivation was very extensive, resulting in low wheat yields. In the autumn of 1958, the People's Commune was established. The Commune Party Committee put forward the resounding slogan "Puddles and swamps transform into wheat fields, lakebeds become flour bins," and organized more than 1,700 young and strong laborers to dig two large drainage ditches in the lake, allowing rainwater to quickly flow into the Shan River after rain, and also allowing water from the Shan River to be diverted for irrigation during droughts. The elimination of the threat of drought and flood greatly increased people's confidence in increasing production.

Before wheat sowing last year, the commune uniformly organized labor, livestock, and two tractors to deeply plow more than 16,000 mu of land, applying 40 dan of base fertilizer per mu. The seeds were generally replaced with improved wheat varieties such as "Bi Ma No. 1" and "Nan Da 2419," and were soaked and mixed with pesticides. The seeding rate was increased from 11 or 12 jin per mu in the past to more than 25 jin, achieving dense planting and full seedlings. During the wheat growing process, these three brigades all fixed labor to form specialized wheat field management teams, led by the deputy secretary of the brigade Party general branch and the deputy captains of the production teams, who were specifically in charge of wheat production. Last winter and this spring, these three brigades accumulated a large amount of fertilizer, applying topdressing fertilizer three times to all wheat fields. During the wheat jointing and booting stages, when drought and lack of moisture were encountered, water from the Shan River was diverted to irrigate all the wheat fields twice.

The unprecedented bumper wheat harvest in Liuye Lake has changed the impoverished face of the local people. In the past, there was a shortage of grain every year. This year, in just the summer season alone, the three brigades turned in public grain and sold surplus grain totaling 2.38 million jin, exceeding the assigned annual procurement task. After retaining seeds, rations, and feed, each person had an average of 15 jin of reserve grain. Now these three brigades are actively purchasing agricultural implements, buying chemical fertilizers, etc., to expand reproduction and strive for an even greater harvest in the autumn.

### “洼地水浪变麦浪湖底变成白面缸”  永城涌现万亩丰产麦

    “洼地水浪变麦浪湖底变成白面缸”
    永城涌现万亩丰产麦
    新华社郑州2日电　河南永城县双桥人民公社认真改变洼地面貌，使低洼易涝的柳叶湖内一万六千零十七亩小麦空前丰收。经过收打过秤，平均亩产四百零七斤，比1958年平均亩产一百三十斤增产二点一三倍。
    双桥公社的柳叶湖包括二十里铺、十八里和魏庄三个大队，在山河南岸东西长二十里，南北宽二里，地势低洼，形状像一个漫长的柳叶。湖中土地大部是红土，既不耐旱，又不耐涝，每年连一季小麦也不能保收。在高级农业合作化前，湖内有四、五千亩土地是颗粒不收的荒地。1956年建立高级农业社，这里的土地虽然全部开垦出来了，但是水、旱灾害并未根除，人们有着“种在人、收在天”的思想，耕作十分粗放，因而小麦产量很低。1958年秋季成立人民公社。公社党委提出了“洼地水浪变麦浪，湖底变成白面缸”的响亮口号，组织青壮年劳力一千七百多人，在湖里挖了两条大排水渠，使雨后积水可以迅速流入山河，天旱还能引山河水灌溉。旱涝威胁的解除，大大提高了人们的增产信心。
    去年小麦播种前，公社统一组织劳动力、畜力和两部拖拉机，深翻了这一万六千多亩土地，每亩施底肥四十担。种子普遍换用“碧蚂一号”和“南大二四一九”等小麦良种，并进行浸种、拌种。播种量由过去每亩下种十一、二斤增加到二十五斤以上，做到密植全苗。在小麦生长过程中，这三个大队都固定劳动力，组成麦田管理专业队，由大队党总支副书记和生产队副队长专门领导小麦生产。去冬今春这三个大队积制了大批肥料，使全部麦田普施追肥三次。在小麦拔节、孕穗期间，遇到干旱缺墒，又引山河水把全部麦田普浇了两遍。
    柳叶湖小麦空前丰收，改变了当地人民的穷困面貌。过去这里年年缺粮，今年单是夏季一季，三个大队就缴公粮、卖余粮二百三十八万斤，超过了分配的全年征购任务。其余的在留了种子、口粮和饲料以外，每人平均有储备粮十五斤。现在这三个大队纷纷添购农具，买化学肥料等，扩大再生产，争取秋季更大丰收。
