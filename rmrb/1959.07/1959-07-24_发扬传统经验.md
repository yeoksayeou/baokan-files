    Promote Traditional Experience
    Taking on apprentices is a traditional experience of traditional Chinese medicine for passing on medical technology that has existed for thousands of years. Since 1956, especially since last year, after implementing the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, many places have successively adopted this method to cultivate new forces in traditional Chinese medicine. In some counties where the work started earlier and is better, nearly half of the TCM practitioners have taken on apprentices. According to statistics from Hunan Province, the total number of TCM practitioners taking on apprentices has reached more than 11,000, of which more than 1,000 have graduated after assessment and have taken up their posts. It is conceivable that the number of TCM apprentices is increasing day by day, and the number of people who graduate and become doctors will continue to increase. They will continuously strengthen the health workforce and promote the accelerated development of the people's medical and health care undertakings. At the same time, in the current situation where the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine has not yet been systematically整理, the apprentices of traditional Chinese medicine in various places inherit the experience of hundreds of thousands of TCM practitioners, especially veteran TCM practitioners, through the oral teachings of their teachers, which is of great significance for the development of traditional Chinese medicine.
    In accordance with the spirit of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine and proceeding from the historical characteristics of our country, it is completely correct and necessary for various places to successively use the traditional experience of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners taking on apprentices to cultivate new forces in traditional Chinese medicine. However, inheriting this traditional experience is not the same as sticking to conventions. Today, all aspects of the situation are different from the past, and the tasks of apprentices are also different from the past. In the past, they learned traditional Chinese medicine to seek a way of life for themselves, and it was a great success to graduate and start a business; now they are learning traditional Chinese medicine, and they must also learn Western medicine, so that the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine can create a new Chinese medicine. This is the glorious task of the new generation of TCM practitioners today. In order to achieve this goal, when adopting the experience of masters taking on apprentices, various places have supplemented and developed the content and form of learning, and have begun to accumulate a lot of experience. From the perspective of learning content, many places focus on learning the theory of traditional Chinese medicine and the clinical experience of masters, and have also added some necessary basic medical science knowledge courses such as physiology, hygiene, infectious disease学, and epidemiology. This is very helpful for using modern medical science knowledge to study traditional Chinese medicine.
    From the perspective of learning forms, various places have adopted various forms according to the learning content, adapting to local conditions and circumstances, but most of them are based on internships with teachers, supplemented by collective classes. In this way, not only can they learn traditional Chinese medicine theory, basic medical science knowledge, and culture in collective classes, but also effectively improve the apprentices' ability to accept and learn the teacher's oral teachings, which has the effect of shortening the time and enhancing the effect for cultivating new forces in traditional Chinese medicine.
    Furthermore, the way TCM teachers teach apprentices is also constantly changing. For example, TCM teachers in Hongkou District, Shanghai, have changed their past habit of not interfering with each other in order to enable apprentices to learn quickly and well. They collectively study and prepare lessons, each showing their strengths, and the effect is remarkable. Nine teachers have taken on seventeen apprentices, and they can all complete the planned learning plan half a year to a year in advance. Their spirit and practice of continuously improving teaching and cultivating new forces in traditional Chinese medicine faster and better for the motherland have been praised by the Ministry of Health.
    While giving full play to the traditional experience of TCM practitioners taking on apprentices in various places, relevant departments and local party committees also need to strengthen leadership and help teachers and apprentices solve ideological, teaching, and life problems in a timely manner, so as to better develop the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine.

    发扬传统经验
    带徒弟，是几千年来中医传授医疗技术的传统经验。从1956年特别是去年以来，贯彻执行了党的中医政策后，许多地方相继采用了这种办法，培养中医新生力量。有些工作开展较早较好的县，中医已有近半数人带徒弟。如湖南省统计，到目前，中医带徒弟的总数达一万一千名以上，其中有一千多名经鉴定结业，已走上工作岗位。可以想见，中医学徒日益增多，学成出师的人也将不断增加。他们将不断壮大卫生工作队伍，促进人民医疗保健事业的加速发展。同时，在当前祖国医学遗产还没有进行系统整理的情况下，各地中医学徒通过老师口传心授，把全国几十万中医特别是老中医的经验，很好继承下来，这对于发展祖国医学有着重大的意义。
    根据党的中医政策的精神，并从我国历史特点出发，各地先后运用中医带徒弟的传统经验培养中医新生力量，是完全正确而必要的。但是，承继这种传统经验并不等于墨守成规。今天各方面情况均非昔比，学徒的任务也与过去不同。过去，他们学中医是为了求得个人生活门路，学成出师开业就算大功告成；现在他们学习中医，还要学习西医，使中西医合流创造祖国的新医学。这是今天新一代中医的光荣任务。为了实现这一目标，各地在采用师傅带徒弟这一经验时，从学习的内容到形式已经有所补充和发展；并已开始积累了不少经验。从学习内容看，许多地方以学习中医理论和师傅临床经验为主，又增加了学习生理卫生、传染病学、流行病学等一些必要的基本医学科学知识课程。这对运用现代医学科学知识研究祖国医药学是很有帮助的。
    从学习形式看，各地根据学习内容，因时因地制宜，采取了多种多样的形式，但大多是从师见习为主，辅以集体上课。这样，既能够在集体上课时学习到中医理论、基本医学科学知识和文化等，更能够有效地提高学徒的接受能力，学好老师的口授心传，这对培养中医新生力量有着缩短时间、增强效果的作用。
    再从中医老师教徒弟的方式来说，也在不断变化。如上海市虹口区中医老师们，为了让学徒学得快、学得好，改变了过去互不过问的习惯。他们集体研究备课，各展所长，效果显著。九个老师带了十七个徒弟，都可以提前半年到一年完成预定的学习计划。他们这样不断改进教学，为祖国更快更好地培养中医新生力量的精神和作法，已经得到了中央卫生部的表扬。
    各地在充分发挥中医带徒弟的传统经验时，还需有关部门和当地党委加强领导，及时帮助师徒解决思想、教学和生活等问题，以便更好地发展祖国医药学遗产。
