Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: The Ministry of Railways recently analyzed the situation of railway transportation in China for the second half of the year and decided to strengthen the organization of freight sources in the third quarter and vigorously carry out "advance transportation," that is, to transport as much as possible of the materials that can be transported in advance from the fourth quarter, in order to meet the needs of continued economic construction development in the second half of the year.

China's railway freight volume has increased significantly in the first half of this year. The average number of freight cars loaded daily nationwide in June increased by about 6,000 compared to the beginning of the year. However, according to a survey by the Ministry of Railways, the transportation volume required for coal and steel production will be very large in the second half of this year, especially in the fourth quarter, and the transportation of grain, cotton, and various daily necessities will also increase significantly. With the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, it is estimated that the average number of freight cars loaded daily nationwide in the fourth quarter will increase significantly compared to the first half of the year, making the task very heavy. Therefore, if more materials can be transported in advance in the third quarter, more vehicles can be freed up in the very busy fourth quarter to transport more key materials; the transportation in the third and fourth quarters can also be more balanced as a result.

The Ministry of Railways has already deployed the "advance transportation" work to various railway bureaus. The national railway freight plan for July, after collaborative planning by the Ministry of Railways and various industrial and agricultural production departments, already includes "advance transportation" materials such as timber, ore, paper raw materials, and salt, totaling more than 800 cars per day. These materials are large in quantity, easy to store, and beneficial to both the production departments and necessary for the user departments after advance transportation. Shanxi Province recently held a special railway "advance transportation" meeting, deciding to vigorously organize the advance transportation of mineral building materials and non-metallic ores. These materials are necessary for current construction units and can be transported in advance during the rainy third quarter. Some enterprises in Shanxi Province that produce sand, stone, and non-metallic ores have already increased their production plans for the third quarter, preparing to adjust labor, find ways to increase flatcars, high platforms, and other handling tools and loading equipment, and strive to produce and transport more.

In order to ensure that there are sufficient vehicles for "advance transportation," the Ministry of Railways is tapping transportation potential from three aspects to increase vehicles: First, further promote various effective advanced experiences from the first half of the year, especially seriously implement comprehensive transportation operation plans and organize Red Flag trains to improve transportation efficiency and accelerate vehicle turnover; Second, strive to complete the construction of a batch of new freight cars planned for the third quarter ahead of schedule; Third, strengthen the maintenance of locomotives and vehicles and reduce the number of vehicles under repair.

With the increase in "advance transportation," packaging and loading equipment must be increased accordingly. The Ministry of Railways requires all production departments to strengthen loading and unloading operations in addition to taking care to protect packaging materials and recycle them as much as possible. Recently, the State Economic Commission has allocated hundreds of tons of iron wire to the forestry department for loading timber during transportation.

The third quarter is the rainy season in many areas of China, which increases the difficulties for railway transportation. The Ministry of Railways has instructed all railway bureaus to take precautions against rain, strengthen the organization of freight sources in rainy weather, and prevent under-loading of cars in rainy weather.

    把第四季度可以提前运输的物资尽量早运多运
    铁道部决定开展“提前运输”
    新华社14日讯　铁道部最近分析了下半年我国铁路运输的形势，决定在第三季度加强组织货源，大力开展
  “提前运输”，即把第四季度可以提前运输的物资尽力早早地运，多多地运，适应下半年经济建设继续发展的需要。
    我国铁路货运量今年上半年有很大增长。6月份全国每天平均货运装车数比年初增加约六千车。但是据铁道部调查，今年下半年，特别是第四季度，煤炭、钢铁生产所需要的运输量很大，粮食、棉花和各种日用必需品的运输也要增加很多。随着工农业生产的继续跃进，预计第四季度全国铁路每天平均装车数将比上半年有较大的增加，任务十分繁重。因此，如果能够提前在第三季度多运一些物资，就能在运输十分繁忙的第四季度腾出更多的车辆，运输更多的重点物资；三、四季度的运输也可以因此较为均衡了。
    铁道部已经向各铁路局部署了“提前运输”的工作。7月份的全国铁路货运计划，经过铁道部和工农业生产各部门的协作筹划，已经列入的“提前运输”的物资，如木材、矿石、造纸原料、食盐等，每天有八百多车。这些物资数量大，易于保管，提前运输后，既有利于生产部门，又为使用部门所必需。山西省最近专门召开了铁路“提前运输”的会议，决定大力组织矿物建筑材料和非金属矿石的提前运输，这些物资为当前建筑施工单位所必需，也有条件在多雨的第三季度提前多运。山西省一些生产砂、石和非金属矿石的企业，已经提高了第三季度的生产计划，准备调整劳动力，设法增加小平车、高站台等搬运工具和装车设备，力争多产、多运。
    为了保证有足够的车辆进行“提前运输”，铁道部正在从三个方面挖掘运输潜力，增加车辆：一、进一步推广上半年各种行之有效的先进经验，特别是认真推行运输综合作业方案和组织红旗列车，提高运输效率，加速车辆周转；二、计划在第三季度新造的一批货车，力争提前造好；三、加强机车、车辆的维修保养工作，压缩检修的车辆。
    随着“提前运输”的增加，包装、装运器材必须相应地增加。铁道部要求各生产部门除了大力加强装卸作业以外，要加意爱护包装器材，尽量回收再用。最近，国家经济委员会已经拨给林业部门数百吨铁丝，作为运输木材时装车用。
    第三季度正是我国许多地区的雨季，这给铁路运输增加了困难。铁道部已经指示各铁路局作好防雨措施，加强雨天的货源组织工作，防止雨天装车亏欠。
