    Transforming wild medicinal animals and plants into domesticated animals and cultivated plants is a fundamental measure for developing the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials. Many regions have adopted this method, raising medicinal animals that had never been raised before and planting medicinal plants that had never been cultivated before, thereby expanding the source of medicinal materials and facilitating the realization of "local production and local supply."
    Through continuous efforts over the past few years, various regions have made considerable achievements in the breeding and cultivation of medicinal animals and plants. At present, the medicinal animals being experimentally raised in various regions, in addition to the relatively common deer, include more than a dozen species such as musk deer, bears, monkeys, hedgehogs, bats, snakes, scorpions, stiff silkworms, centipedes, ground beetles, geckos, and seahorses. There are even more wild plant medicinal materials that have been successfully cultivated and medicinal materials that can be introduced for planting in other regions.
    Due to the widespread cultivation of wild medicinal materials and the introduction of medicinal materials from other regions, many authentic medicinal materials have been successfully established in new locations. Ginseng, which was previously cultivated only in Jilin and Liaoning provinces, has now been successfully trial-planted in Heilongjiang, Shanxi, and other provinces. Some medicinal material production farms in Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Shandong are also conducting experiments on ginseng cultivation. Rehmannia glutinosa, a famous northern medicinal material, was previously mainly produced in Henan, but now it has been successfully planted in more than a dozen provinces. Rehmannia glutinosa introduced by Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province generally yields more than 3,000 jin per mu, with some yields exceeding 10,000 jin per mu. Henan Rehmannia glutinosa in Liuyang, Hunan, yields more than 4,000 jin of fresh goods per mu. Safflower and Achyranthes bidentata, which were also previously produced in only a few regions, are now cultivated on a large scale in many provinces.
    The successful cultivation of many medicinal materials in different locations has gradually broken the notion that medicinal materials cannot grow or grow well when transplanted, creating favorable conditions for further expanding the production of medicinal materials in the future.

    变野生野长为家种家养
    变野生药用动物、植物为饲养动物和栽培植物，是发展中药材生产的一项带有根本性质的措施。不少地区由于采用了这种方法，饲养了从来没有养过的药用动物，种植了从来没有栽培过的药用植物，从而扩大了药源，有利于实现“就地生产，就地供应”。
    各地经过近几年的不断努力，在饲养、培植药用动物、植物方面，已取得不少成绩。目前各地试养的药用动物，除了比较普遍的鹿以外，还有獐子、熊、猴、刺猬、蝙蝠、蛇、蝎子、殭蚕、蜈蚣、地鳖、蛤蚧和海马等十几种。目前栽培成功的野生植物药材和可以引向外地种植的药材就更多了。
    由于各地广泛栽培野生药材和引种外地药材，不少地道药材在别处安家落户了。过去只有吉林、辽宁两省栽培的人参，现在黑龙江、山西等省已试种成功。广东、浙江、山东一些药材生产场，也在进行栽培人参的试验。著名的北方药材生地，过去主要产在河南，现在有十几个省种植成功。湖北襄阳专区引种的生地，一般亩产三千多斤，高的亩产一万多斤。湖南浏阳的河南生地亩产鲜货四千多斤。红花、牛膝，过去也是少数地区生产，现在许多省都有大面积栽培。
    许多药材异地种植成功，逐渐打破了药材易地栽培不能生长或生长不好的说法，给今后进一步扩大药材生产创造了良好的条件。
