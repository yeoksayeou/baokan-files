An Unforgettable Tune: "Butterflies in Pairs"
—On the Cantonese Opera "Guan Hanqing"
Han Beiping, text; Ye Qianyu, sketch

Beijing's stage is a garden where a hundred flowers bloom. The Cantonese Opera "Guan Hanqing," amidst the vying colors and fragrances, exudes the floral scent of the South, the fragrance of pineapples and mangoes. As the moon wanes and a cool breeze whispers, people leaving the theater still hear the echo of the tune "Butterflies in Pairs" in their ears. The images of Guan Hanqing and Zhu Lianxiu will linger in people's memories for a long time.

Guan Hanqing, a great playwright, the voice of the people; Zhu Lianxiu, a woman oppressed at the bottom of society, her "passionate heart cooled," yet standing tall, displaying a noble soul. To describe the union of these two characters as "intimate friends in the demimonde" seems inappropriate to me, or at least incomplete. They formed a friendship in the struggle against the feudal rulers, and the comradeship surpassed mere romantic love. Therefore, their joint struggle inspires people. When they are persecuted, it does not cause mere lamentation, but rather generates hatred and anger toward the feudal rulers, and strengthens people's fighting spirit. "The cage will be broken one day, unyielding to a hundred torments" is both an encouragement at the time of parting and a vow to continue the struggle.

Comrade Tian Han's drama "Guan Hanqing" is the foundation for the success of the Cantonese Opera "Guan Hanqing." However, adaptation still requires creativity. The Cantonese Opera "Guan Hanqing" is able to remain fundamentally faithful to the original while not being bound by it, and gives it new life according to the characteristics of opera. It should be said that the adaptation work has been done relatively well. It is said that Comrade Tian Han made suggestions on the adaptation and polished the lyrics, which of course allowed the spirit of the original to be better preserved and developed.

The biggest difference between the drama and the Cantonese opera lies in the ending of the play. This is a question worth studying. Is it better to end with a comedy or a tragedy? There is some debate. I am in favor of a tragic ending. In that era of high-pressure feudal rule, Guan and Zhu, who dared to resist head-on, would inevitably be hit. Could this not be called historical truth? Guan Hanqing's expulsion from Dadu was, of course, an unexpected stroke of luck; Zhu Lianxiu's inability to be removed from the register seems inevitable. "Prostitutes are not allowed to marry men of letters and scholars." A tragic ending provokes more profound thought than a comedic one. In terms of artistic treatment, the abrupt shift to a happy ending after the tune "Butterflies in Pairs," "the beams broken and pillars collapsed, the people withered, the pipes broken and strings snapped, unable to make a sound," is too sudden. Hong Xiannv, who plays Zhu Lianxiu, once said: "To go from meeting in prison to a tearful, happy reunion is like asking a torrential river to suddenly flow backward and stop. This is very difficult to achieve." I think she has a point.

Some of the changes in the adaptation in certain details are also commendable. For example, in the second scene, in the drama version, Guan Hanqing and Zhu Lianxiu are already present when the curtain opens, which is not inherently bad; but in terms of the requirements of the drama, the quiet appearance of the heroine is somewhat lacking. Now it has been changed to Zhu Lianxiu entering the stage alone, with a dance and four lines of a introductory poem, which is much more appropriate. In addition, there is the interlude of the maid, Mei Xiang, seeing Guan Hanqing ascending the stairs and preparing two cups of tea in advance, illustrating the relationship between Zhu and Guan. Guan Hanqing's holding of Zhu Xiaolan's case file shows that he has already investigated this unjust case and laid a strong foreshadowing for writing "Dou E's Injustice." Although the plot is subtle, it makes the characters' personalities, relationships, and structure more vivid and compact.

Having a good script does not necessarily guarantee a good performance. It also requires the creativity of the actors and the enhancement of the music.

I once asked Ma Shizeng and Hong Xiannv how they understood the spirit of the script and created the characters. They answered in detail, but they shared a common opinion: their fate in the old society was the same as that of Guan Hanqing and Zhu Lianxiu. The oppression of artists and the bullying of actresses, all kinds of appalling things, they had all suffered. In the "Guan Hanqing" script, they relived their past lives. Ma Shizeng even said: "I think this script also has Comrade Tian Han's own shadow." The denunciation of the old society and the love for the new society are combined, and a moving image appears on the stage. In the second scene, Guan Hanqing intends to write "Dou E's Injustice," and he and Zhu Lianxiu have a brief dialogue: "Do you dare to perform it?" "Do you dare to write it?" "I dare to write it!" "I dare to perform it!" The audience claps enthusiastically, supporting their struggle. In the seventh scene, meeting in prison, "Butterflies in Pairs," "writing out the heroic spirit, inspiring the daughter's love," the actors perform well and sing well, but what moves the audience even more is that through the lyrics and the performance, we see the completion of two shining characters, and thus generate joy and respect.

The Cantonese Opera "Guan Hanqing" did not reach today's level all at once. It has gone through deliberation, practice, and, more importantly, the help of collective efforts to gradually reach this stage of relatively excellent performance. The actors also encountered confusion in their artistic creation.

Generally speaking, the actors have the hatred of the old society and the love of the new society as support, and they have a basis for shaping the characters, and it is possible to delve deeper. However, there are difficulties in specific performances. For example, in the scene of meeting in prison, Zhu Lianxiu almost uses her whole life to sing "Butterflies in Pairs," but what about Guan Hanqing, who is standing aside? I saw that Ma Shizeng's initial performances were too strong, with too many and too large movements, and the emotions were not deep enough. The actor himself was not satisfied either. After a period of exploration, Ma Shizeng had a new understanding: Guan Hanqing did not prepare to show "Butterflies in Pairs" to Zhu Lianxiu when he wrote it, but only as his own lyrical swan song. When Zhu recites it, Guan Hanqing initially has the feeling of listening to his own work, gradually delving into the realm of poetry, and his emotions are sublimated, immersed in the ideals and wishes of people with the same fate. This is an actor's understanding. He acted according to this understanding, and naturally, it was more coordinated than before. Perhaps it is not ideal enough, and perhaps it will need to be revised in the future, but this kind of research is valuable, especially for an old actor like Ma Shizeng, who is so diligent, which is admirable.

Hong Xiannv plays Zhu Lianxiu, "falling into the demimonde for twenty years, how many strings have been broken on the pipa," a noble soul, but relegated to an environment that is despised. It is not easy to fully express these two aspects of life. She herself once wrote an article, in which she talked about her own experiences and the joys and hardships of creation, which is very pertinent. I just want to give one example to illustrate her efforts in artistic creation. In the sixth scene, Ah Heima ordered the suspension of the performance of "Dou E's Injustice," called Zhu onto the stage, scolded her, and then asked her to re-perform it in person. Zhu Lianxiu appears on stage twice, once as Zhu herself, and again as Dou E, and then again as Zhu Lianxiu. The identities are different, the emotions change suddenly, and the performance area is small. This is an examination for the actor. Hong Xiannv grasped this red line: "Dou E teaches me, Zhu Lianxiu, never bow my head to the enemy." Taking Dou E as an example, facing strongmen like Ah Heima, the thoughts and feelings of Zhu Lianxiu and Dou E are united. After Zhu was imprisoned, seeing the prison uniform worn by Dou E also gave her courage. When she read Guan Hanqing's newly written lyrics for "Dou E's Injustice," it was also the crystallization of Dou's grief and Zhu's emotional outburst. Because of this understanding, coupled with what Hong Xiannv herself said: "This script is like a memoir of an artist," she shaped a brilliant image.

Comrade Tian Han's several new lyrics are beautiful and profound. Now, matched with the newly created musical score, they complement each other, and everyone is moved by the tune "Butterflies in Pairs."

In the theater, people often clap their hands involuntarily, and I also involuntarily wrote this article. (Attached pictures)

    一曲难忘“蝶双飞”
    ——谈粤剧“关汉卿”
    韩北屏文　叶浅予速写
    北京的舞台，是百花盛开的园地。粤剧“关汉卿”在争妍斗艳的花丛中，散发着南国的花香，菠萝和芒果的芬芳。月西斜，凉风习习，人们走出剧场之后，耳畔还回响着一曲“蝶双飞”。关汉卿和朱廉秀的形象，将使人久久不能忘怀。
    关汉卿，一个伟大的戏剧家，人民的代言人；朱廉秀，一个被压迫在底层的妇女，“冷却了热心肠”，却又昂然挺立，展示了高尚的灵魂。这两个人物的结合，用“风尘知己”来形容，我看是不太恰当的，至少是不完全的，他们在向封建统治者的斗争中结成友谊，战友的感情超过了儿女私情，因而他们携手斗争时，给人以激励，当他们受到折磨时，不是使人扼腕，而是使人产生对封建统治者的仇恨和愤怒，还是增强了人们的斗志。“破笼终有日，百折不能磨”，是生离时的鼓舞，也是继续斗争的信誓。
    田汉同志的话剧“关汉卿”，是粤剧“关汉卿”成功的基础。但是，改编仍然需要创造。粤剧“关汉卿”能作到基本忠实于原作而不拘泥于原作，并且按照戏曲的特点赋予新的生命，应该说，改编工作是做得较好的。听说田汉同志对改编本提过意见，并润饰过唱词，当然使原作精神能更好地保留和发扬了。
    话剧本和粤剧本最大的不同，在于戏剧的结尾。这是一个值得研究的问题。到底是喜剧收场好，还是悲场收场好？争论是有的。我是赞成悲剧收场的。在那个封建统治高压的年代里，敢于正面抗争的关朱，一定会受到打击，这是不是可以叫做历史的真实呢？关汉卿之被逐出大都，固然是意外的幸运；朱廉秀之不能脱籍，似乎也是势所必然。“行院妓女不准嫁文人学士”，悲剧收场比喜剧收场更引起深思。就艺术处理来说，一曲“蝶双飞”，
  “栋折梁摧人竟萎，管残弦断不成声”之后，急转而大团圆，实在太骤然了。饰朱廉秀的红线女曾经说过：“由狱中相会，一转到破涕为笑的大团圆，如同倾泻而下的万里江河，突然要它倒流停滞一样，这是很难做到的。”我想，她这番话是有道理的。
    在改编本的若干细节的改变上，也有可取之处。比如第二场，话剧本幕开时，关汉卿和朱廉秀都已在场，这本来没有什么不好；但就戏剧的要求来说，女主角悄悄出现，总有点儿欠缺。现在改成朱廉秀单独上场，一段舞蹈，四句定场诗，就妥贴得多。另外，还穿插梅香遥见关汉卿登楼，预斟双盏茶，说明朱与关的关系；关汉卿手持朱小兰案卷上来，说明他对这一冤狱已作了调查研究，设下了后来写“窦娥冤”的有力伏笔。情节虽然细微，但是使人物性格，相互关系更鲜明，结构更缜密了。
    有了一个好的剧本，不一定有一次好的演出。这里面还需要演员的创造和音乐的烘托。
    我曾经问过马师曾和红线女，他们是怎样来体会剧本的精神、创造人物的。他们回答很详尽，可是有一个共同的意见，那就是他们在旧社会的命运，和关汉卿、朱廉秀的命运相同。压迫艺人欺侮女戏子，种种令人发指的事情，他们全遭受过。他们在“关汉卿”剧本中，重温了过去的生活。马师曾甚至这样说：“我想这个剧本中也有田汉同志自己的影子。”对旧社会的控诉，对新社会的热爱，两种感情溶合在一起，舞台上才出现了动人的形象。第二场戏中，关汉卿打算写“窦娥冤”了，他和朱廉秀有一段简洁的对白；“你敢演？”“你敢写？”“我敢写！”“我敢演！”观众热烈地拍起手来，这是在支持他们的斗争。第七场狱中相会、“蝶双飞”“写尽英雄气，激发女儿情”，演员演得好，唱得好，但更使观众倾心的，是通过曲词，通过表演，我们看到了两个光辉性格的完成，因而产生喜悦，产生敬重。
    粤剧“关汉卿”不是一下子达到今天的水平的。它经过揣摩、实践，更经过集体力量的帮助，才逐渐走到演出较优秀的这一步。演员在艺术创造上也遇到过困惑。
    从总的方面来说，演员有对旧社会的憎恨和对新社会的热爱作支持，塑造人物有凭借，有可能钻得深些。然而，在具体的表演上，不是没有困难。比如狱中相会那一场中，朱廉秀几乎用全生命去唱“蝶双飞”，可是站在一旁的关汉卿怎么办？我看到马师曾最初几场的表演，反映太强烈，动作过多过大，感情不够深沉。演员自己也不满意。马师曾经过一段探索，他自己有了新的理解：关汉卿写出“蝶双飞”，并没有准备给朱廉秀看，只不过是自己的抒情绝笔，当朱念它时，关汉卿开始还有听自己作品的感觉，逐渐深入诗境，感情升华，沉浸到同运命人的理想和愿望中去了。这是一个演员的理解，他按照这个理解去作了，自然就比以前更协调。也许还不够理想，也许今后还需要修改，但这种钻研是可贵的，特别像马师曾这样的老演员，如此勤奋，令人欣佩。
    红线女饰演朱廉秀，“身落风尘二十年，琵琶弹断几多弦”，一个高尚的灵魂，却沦落在被人贱视的环境之中。要把这两种思想生活完满地表现出来，很不容易。她自己曾经写过一篇文章，那里面有她自己的体会和创作的甘苦，说得很中肯。我只想举一个例子，来说明她的艺术创造的努力。第六场，阿合马勒令停演“窦娥冤”，叫朱上场，骂了一顿，又叫她当面重演一遍。朱廉秀两次上场，一次是朱本人，再一次是窦娥，而后又是朱廉秀，身份不同，感情突变，表演区域又小，这对演员是一场考试。红线女把握着这样一根红线：“窦娥教我朱廉秀，决不低头让敌人。”以窦娥为榜样，面对阿合马这一类强人，朱廉秀和窦娥的思想感情合而为一了。朱入狱之后，看到身穿演窦娥的囚衣，也给了她勇气。就是在她读关汉卿新写“窦娥冤”曲词时，激昂高亢，也是窦的悲愤和朱的感情爆发的结晶。由于这种理解，再加上红线女自己说的：“这个剧本好像是艺人的回忆录”，所以她塑造了一个光辉的形象。
    田汉同志的几首新词，隽美而深刻，现在配上新制的乐谱，相得益彰，谁也给一曲“蝶双飞”打动心了。
    在剧场里，常常有人情不自禁地拍手，我也是情不自禁地写了这篇文章。（附图片）
