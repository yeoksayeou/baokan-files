Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 28th—Blas Roca, General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, said in an article discussing the situation in Latin America that current events in Latin America indicate that U.S. imperialist rule is facing a crisis.

Roca's article, published in the "Hoy" newspaper on the 28th, stated that the victories achieved by the people of Venezuela and Cuba have greatly spurred all forces—whether the most conservative or the most radical—to strive for liberation from the rule of U.S. imperialism. After mentioning the ongoing armed struggle against dictatorships by the people of the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua, Roca listed some of the most convincing facts to illustrate how the great people's struggle is developing like a prairie fire in Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico, Brazil, and other Latin American countries. He pointed out that everywhere, the struggle between two factions is extremely fierce: one faction hopes that Latin American countries will continue to be exploited by U.S. trusts and monopolies and be subject to Washington's political control; the other faction hopes to destroy this exploitation and control, hopes to achieve complete national independence in all Latin American countries, hopes to promote their economic development according to the needs of their countries, and hopes to strive for democracy and improve the people's living standards. Roca pointed out that the struggle between these main forces is the fundamental reason for the turbulent situation in all Latin American countries today. He pointed out that the factor that best reflects the essence of this situation is that governments that are subservient to Washington and U.S. monopoly organizations can no longer continue to maintain their rule in the original way, and the people are not prepared to continue to endure their rule.

Roca strongly condemned the actions of the "Organization of American States." He said that it is becoming increasingly clear that the "Organization of American States" is merely an absolutely docile tool in the hands of U.S. imperialism, which imposes its resolutions on the people of Latin America under the guise of unity among the American peoples.

Roca spoke about the visits of parliamentary delegations from some Latin American countries to the Soviet Union and China. He said that these visits have opened up new prospects for the relationship between Latin America as a whole and the socialist camp. He pointed out that the establishment of relations between Latin American countries and socialist countries will greatly help Latin America free itself from imperialist oppression. This relationship opens the door for them to conduct mutually beneficial trade, obtain economic and technical assistance without any political conditions, and develop their national economies.

Roca finally emphasized that the revolutions in Latin American countries have common problems and are interconnected, because their common major enemy is the cruel and hypocritical U.S. imperialism. Roca called on the people of Latin America to strengthen their unity, because unity is the most important thing for the development of the revolution in each country and for the realization of their liberation goals.

    古巴人民社会党总书记罗加指出
    拉丁美洲革命火焰迅速蔓延
    美帝国主义的统治发生严重危机
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　古巴人民社会党总书记布拉斯·罗加在一篇论述拉丁美洲形势的文章中说，拉丁美洲目前的种种事件表明美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的统治发生了危机。
    罗加这篇刊载在28日的“今日报”上的文章说，委内瑞拉和古巴人民取得的胜利，大大地推动了一切力量——不论是最保守的还是最激进的，去争取从美国帝国主义的统治下解放出来。罗加在谈到多米尼加和尼加拉瓜人民目前进行的反独裁武装斗争以后，列举若干最有说服力的事实来说明，巨大的人民斗争如何像燎原的烈火一样在巴拉圭、阿根廷、玻利维亚、墨西哥、巴西和其它拉丁美洲国家发展。他指出，在所有的地方，两派力量之间的斗争都十分激烈，一派力量希望拉丁美洲国家继续受美国托辣斯和垄断组织的剥削，受到华盛顿的政治控制，另一派力量希望摧毁这种剥削和控制，希望在拉丁美洲所有国家都获得彻底的民族独立，希望按照他们国家的需要来推动他们的经济发展，希望争取民主，和提高人民的生活水平。罗加指出，这些主要力量之间的斗争是今天一切拉丁美洲国家局势动荡的根本原因。他指出，最能反映这种局势实质的因素是，屈从于华盛顿和美国垄断组织的政府再也不能继续用原有的方式来维持它们的统治了，而人民也不准备继续忍受它们的统治。
  罗加有力地谴责了“美洲国家组织”的行动。他说，事情越来越清楚，“美洲国家组织”只不过是美帝国主义手中一个绝对驯顺的工具，它假借美洲人民团结一致的名义，把它的决议强加给拉丁美洲人民。
    罗加谈到拉丁美洲一些国家的议会代表团到苏联和中国的访问。他说，这些访问为整个拉丁美洲和社会主义阵营的关系打开了新的前景。他指出，拉丁美洲国家和社会主义国家建立关系，将大大有助于拉丁美洲挣脱帝国主义的压迫。这种关系为他们打开了进行互利贸易、获得不附任何政治条件的经济和技术援助以及发展民族经济的大门。
    罗加最后强调指出，拉丁美洲各国的革命有着共同的问题，并且是相互关连着的，因为他们共同的主要敌人是残酷而又伪善的美帝国主义。罗加号召拉丁美洲人民加强他们之间的团结，因为对每个国家革命的发展以及实现他们解放的目的，团结是最重要的。
