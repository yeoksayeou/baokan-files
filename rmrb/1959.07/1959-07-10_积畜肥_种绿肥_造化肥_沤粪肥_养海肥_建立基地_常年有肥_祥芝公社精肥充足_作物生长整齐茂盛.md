    Establish Bases, Have Fertilizer Year-Round
    Xiangzhi Commune Has Sufficient Refined Fertilizer, Crops Grow Neatly and Vigorously

    Fuzhou, July 9th (Our Dispatch) The Xiangzhi People's Commune in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, has established fertilizer bases in five aspects according to local conditions, producing high-quality fertilizer year-round, which has strongly promoted agricultural production increases. The amount of fertilizer applied to early rice, peanuts, soybeans, early sweet potatoes, etc., planted throughout the commune this year has increased by 20% to 50% compared to last year. Coupled with other production-increasing measures, various crops are growing neatly and vigorously, and a bumper harvest is in sight. The spring soybeans, which have already been harvested in large quantities, generally have a yield increase of more than 20% to 30% compared to last year.

    The Xiangzhi Commune is backed by mountains and faces the sea, and the soil is barren, requiring a large amount of good fertilizer. However, in the past shock campaigns to accumulate fertilizer, the quantity of fertilizer was often emphasized, and insufficient attention was paid to the quality of fertilizer. Therefore, the accumulated miscellaneous soil fertilizer was not highly effective and could not meet the needs of increased production. Since the spring of this year, the major brigades of the commune have started with raising, planting, accumulating, and producing, mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out fertilizer base construction, and rapidly established five major fertilizer bases, constantly supplying a large amount of refined fertilizer to crops.

    Their five major fertilizer bases are:

    1. Raise livestock and poultry to accumulate livestock manure in large quantities. The number of pigs raised in the commune has increased from more than 4,100 at the end of last year to more than 5,900, and there are more than 5,000 sheep; the number of poultry has increased from more than 52,000 to more than 122,000. All poultry and livestock have pens and fences. The entire commune has stipulated fertilizer quotas based on the number of livestock, and implemented a system of dedicated personnel in charge, regular fertilizer delivery, and rewards for exceeding quotas. As a result, the amount of livestock manure accumulated by the entire commune each month has increased from the original 60,000 dan to more than 93,000 dan.

    2. Use open spaces and peanut, soybean, and sweet potato fields to expand the planting or intercropping of green manure crops. The entire commune has now planted more than 4,800 mu of green manure, and will also plant green manure on a large scale in winter using the winter fallow land.

    3. Thirteen local chemical fertilizer plants obtain materials locally and produce local chemical fertilizers year-round. At present, the entire commune has produced 42 kinds of local chemical fertilizers such as potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, and calcium carbonate, with a monthly output of more than 150,000 jin. Local chemical fertilizer production has dedicated personnel for ingredient mixing and testing, so the cost is low and the fertilizer efficiency is high.

    4. Build a large number of composting pits, toilets, and manure collection sites to accumulate and produce compost and manure fertilizer. The entire commune has built more than 9,000 composting pits and toilets in front of and behind houses and in the fields. Each month, more than 300,000 dan of mixed fertilizer can be composted using miscellaneous soil fertilizer, sewage, green grass, and cow dung, and 150,000 dan of human manure and urine are accumulated.

    5. Breed seaweed fertilizer in large quantities. The beaches, small islands, and reefs are divided among the production teams, who are responsible for breeding seaweed and other seaweed fertilizers. At present, the entire commune can accumulate an average of more than 52,000 dan of seaweed fertilizer each month.

    The Xiangzhi Commune has been able to rapidly establish five major year-round fertilizer accumulation bases because they have adopted the following effective measures:

    1. The commune party committee has conducted ideological education for commune members on "fertilizer is the treasure of farmers" and year-round fertilizer accumulation, improving the commune members' understanding of combining year-round fertilizer accumulation with shock campaigns, and actively participating in regular fertilizer accumulation and production. Each production team, through calculating fertilizer sources and fertilizer application accounts, found that coastal areas lack organic fertilizer and mountainous areas lack seaweed fertilizer, and the amount of fertilizer shortage is still quite large. After research, everyone realized that relying solely on shock campaigns to accumulate fertilizer can only accumulate fertilizer three or four times a year, and the accumulated quality is not good and the quantity cannot meet the needs; if attention is paid to year-round fertilizer accumulation, the quality of fertilizer can be guaranteed, and the practice of only collecting and not planting, only fishing and not raising can be quickly changed. Therefore, each team used gaps in time to intercrop and expand the planting of more than 4,800 mu of green manure, and cultivated more than 1,400 mu of seaweed fertilizer.

    2. Establish a year-round fertilizer accumulation and production quota and reward system for exceeding the quota, and integrate fertilizer accumulation and production with agricultural production or daily life. For example, intercropping and expanding the planting of green manure in sweet potato and peanut fields is carried out in conjunction with the weeding and hoeing of these crops, saving labor and effort.

    3. Adopting the method of simultaneously managing raising, planting, accumulating, and producing has greatly expanded the fertilizer source and improved the fertilizer efficiency. For example, in the past, the method of simply collecting wild green manure was relied upon. Now, while collecting green manure, the planting and intercropping of green manure are planned and expanded. In the past, seaweed fertilizer was only collected and accumulated during shock campaigns. Now, it is raised and collected year-round according to the season, and the output has also increased several times compared to the past.

    4. Obtain materials locally and adjust mutually. In the work of establishing fertilizer bases and carrying out year-round fertilizer accumulation and production, the production teams of Xiangzhi Commune, under the unified leadership of the commune, implemented methods such as obtaining materials locally, cooperating with each other, and adjusting mutually. The production teams in coastal and mountainous areas, according to their respective natural conditions, separately raised, planted, accumulated, and produced more seaweed fertilizer and green manure, exchanged them at equal value, and adjusted them mutually, thereby giving full play to the enthusiasm of each production team and commune member in accumulating and producing fertilizer.

### 积畜肥　种绿肥　造化肥　沤粪肥　养海肥  建立基地　常年有肥  祥芝公社精肥充足　作物生长整齐茂盛

    积畜肥　种绿肥　造化肥　沤粪肥　养海肥
    建立基地　常年有肥
    祥芝公社精肥充足　作物生长整齐茂盛
    本报福州9日电　福建省晋江县祥芝人民公社因地制宜从五方面建立肥料基地，常年积造优质肥料，有力地促进了农田增产。全社今年种的早稻、花生、大豆、早甘薯等，施肥量都比去年增加二成到五成，加上其他增产措施，各种作物都长得整齐茂盛，丰收在望。已经大量登场的春大豆，产量一般都比去年增产二、三成以上。
    祥芝公社背山面海，土质瘠薄，需要大量好肥。但是在过去突击积肥运动中，往往强调肥料的数量，没有充分重视肥料的质量，因此积的土杂肥肥效不高，不能适应增产需要。今年春季以来，公社各大队从养、种、积、造等方面入手，发动群众大搞肥料基地建设，迅速建立了五大肥料基地，为农作物经常输送大量精肥。
    他们的五大肥料基地是：
    一、饲养家畜、家禽，大积畜肥。现在全社养猪已由去年底四千一百多头增加到五千九百多头，羊五千多头；家禽由五万二千多只增加到十二万二千多只。所有家禽家畜都有圈有栏。全公社按牲畜头数规定积肥定额，实行专人负责、定期交肥和超额奖励制度。这样全社每月所积畜肥已由原来的六万多担增加到九万三千多担。
    二、利用空地和花生、大豆、甘薯田，扩种或套种绿肥作物。现在全社已种植绿肥四千八百多亩，冬季也将利用冬闲地大种绿肥。
    三、十三个土化肥厂就地取材，常年生产土化肥。目前，全社已经生产氯化钾、氯化镁、炭酸钙等土化肥四十二种，每月产量达十五万多斤。土化肥生产专人配料、化验，因此成本低，肥效高。
    四、大量修建沤肥坑、厕所、粪地，积制沤肥和粪肥。全社已在屋前屋后和田头修建九千多个沤肥坑、厕所，每月用土杂肥、污水、青草、牛粪等可沤制混合肥三十多万担，积蓄人粪、尿十五万担。
    五、大量养殖海肥。把海滩、小岛、礁石划给各生产队，负责繁殖海藻等海肥。现在全社平均每月可积海肥五万二千多担。
    祥芝公社能迅速建立起五大常年积造肥料基地，是因为他们采取了以下一些有效措施：
    一、公社党委对社员作了“肥是农家宝”和常年积肥的思想教育，提高了社员对常年积肥和突击积肥相结合的认识，积极参加经常性的积肥造肥。各生产队通过算肥源和施肥账，发现沿海缺有机质肥，山区缺海肥，缺肥数量还相当大。经过研究，大家认识到单纯依靠突击积肥，一年仅能积肥三、四次，积的质量不好，数量也不能满足需要；如果注意常年积肥，就能保证肥料质量，并且能迅速改变光采不种、光捞不养的作法。因此，各队在短期中就利用空隙时间套种和扩种了绿肥四千八百多亩，养殖海肥一千四百多亩。
    二、建立常年积肥造肥定额和超额奖励制度，并使积肥造肥和农业生产或日常生活结合起来。例如在甘薯、花生等地里间种套种和扩种绿肥，是结合这些作物的中耕除草进行的，省力省工。
    三、采用养、种、积、造四管齐下的办法，大大扩大了肥源，提高了肥效。例如过去是单纯依靠采积野生绿肥的办法，现在一面采积绿肥，一面有计划地扩种、套种绿肥。过去对海肥仅是突击采积，现在是按季节常年养殖和采积，产量也比过去扩大了好几倍。
    四、就地取材，互相调剂。祥芝公社各生产队在建立肥料基地、开展常年积造肥料工作中，在公社统一领导下，贯彻执行了就地取材、互相协作、互相调剂等办法，由沿海和靠山地区的生产队根据各自的自然条件，分别多养多种多积多造海肥和绿肥，等价交换、相互调剂，从而充分发挥了各生产队和社员积造肥料的积极性。
