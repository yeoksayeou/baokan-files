The United States is stepping up its efforts to use the Organization of American States and Cuba's internal counter-revolutionary forces to simultaneously interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and stifle the Cuban revolution from both inside and outside, making the situation in the Caribbean region increasingly tense.

According to Washington sources, under the manipulation and instigation of the United States, the Council of the Organization of American States decided at its meeting on the 18th to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of the twenty-one American countries in Santiago, the capital of Chile, in mid-August to discuss the so-called situation in the Caribbean. According to a broadcast by the "Voice of America," the meeting will also discuss measures to be taken to improve the organization in order to "maintain peace."

There are many indications that convening a meeting of American foreign ministers is an important step by the United States to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and strangle the Cuban revolution. Although the United States failed to persuade the Council of the Organization of American States to adopt its proposal to have the meeting discuss the so-called Cuban and Venezuelan "invasion" of the Dominican Republic, and the Dominican Republic has had to withdraw the accusation; however, American news agencies have revealed that the foreign ministers' meeting will still "likely pay special attention to the infiltration of communism" in the Caribbean region. At the same time, according to the functions of the institutions under the Organization of American States, the meeting of American foreign ministers can be responsible for so-called "defense" issues. Therefore, the United States may once again instigate the Dominican Republic to re-lodge the "invasion" accusation against Cuba at the meeting of American foreign ministers, and then, in the name of so-called "defense" and "peace," use the form of "American police force" to organize open military intervention.

While the United States is actively using the Organization of American States to interfere in Cuba and other countries' internal affairs in the Caribbean region, Cuba's counter-revolutionary forces have also stepped up their coordinated activities.

Following the exposure by the Cuban people of the conspiracy activities of the traitor and former Air Force Commander Diaz Lanz, on the 17th, the Cuban people exposed the conspiracy of former President Urrutia to carry out "anti-government" activities. Cuban Prime Minister Castro said in a statement on the evening of the 17th that Urrutia's "attitude is on the verge of treason."

At the same time, the Cuban government cracked a large-scale subversion case. In this case, the number of criminals involved in smuggling weapons alone reached 150.

According to the Latin American News Agency, the United States and its running dogs - Batista exiles - are plotting to take action against Cuba before July 26. Batista exiles in New York have secretly organized. Now, almost all Batista elements in New York have gone to Miami. This city is considered a springboard for armed intervention in Cuba. A plan for an armed attack on Cuba was announced on the 12th by a "spokesman" for a secret organization of Batista exiles in the United States. The "spokesman" said that other ports on the Florida Peninsula, as well as ports in Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama, would also be used as springboards for the attack on Cuba. The base of the "expeditionary force" will be the Dominican Republic. The plan for an armed attack on Cuba also includes landing at both ends and the middle of the island of Cuba in order to "open up several battle lines simultaneously." The "spokesman" finally said that the direct purpose of these plans is to use the July 26 rally of 500,000 Cuban farmers in Havana to create "confusion" in Fidel Castro's defense system.

### 美国加紧策划摧毁古巴革命

    美国加紧策划摧毁古巴革命
    本报讯　美国正在加紧利用“美洲国家组织”和古巴国内的反革命力量，从内外两个方面同时下手来干涉古巴内政和扼杀古巴革命，使加勒比海地区的局势日趋紧张。
    据华盛顿消息，在美国操纵和策动下，“美洲国家组织”理事会在18日的会议上，决定在8月中旬在智利首都圣地亚哥召开美洲二十一国外长会议来讨论所谓加勒比海的局势。据“美国之音”广播说，这次会议还要讨论为改善这个组织以“维护和平”所应采取的措施。
    有许多迹象表明，召开美洲国家外长会议是美国干涉古巴内政扼杀古巴革命的一个重要步骤。虽然，美国未能使“美洲国家组织”理事会通过它的建议，使这次会议讨论所谓古巴和委内瑞拉“入侵”多米尼加的诬告，多米尼加已不得不撤回了这个指控；但是美国通讯社已经透露，外长会议仍然“可能特别注意共产党渗入”加勒比地区的问题。同时，根据“美洲国家组织”所属机构的职能，美洲国家外长会议能负责所谓“防务”问题。因此，美国可能再度唆使多米尼加在美洲国家外长会议上重新对古巴提出“入侵”的诬告，然后在所谓“防务”和“和平”的名义下，利用“美洲警察部队”形式，组织公开的军事干涉。
    在美国积极利用“美洲国家组织”干涉古巴和加勒比地区其他国家内政的同时，古巴的反革命势力也加紧了他们的配合活动。
    继古巴人民揭露了叛徒前空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯的阴谋活动之后，17日古巴人民又揭露了前总统乌鲁蒂亚进行“反对政府”活动的阴谋。古巴总理卡斯特罗在17日晚的一项声明中说，乌鲁蒂亚的“态度是在卖国的边缘上”。
    与此同时，古巴政府破获了一个大规模的颠覆活动案件。在这一案件中，仅参与偷运武器的罪犯即达一百五十人。
    据拉丁美洲通讯社报道：美国和它的走狗——巴蒂斯塔流亡分子正在策划在7月26日以前对古巴采取行动。在纽约的巴蒂斯塔流亡分子已经秘密地组织起来了。现在，几乎所有在纽约的巴蒂斯塔分子都到迈阿密去了。这个城市被认为是对古巴进行武装干涉的跳板。武装进攻古巴的一套计划是巴蒂斯塔流亡分子在美国的秘密组织的一个“发言人”在12日宣布的。这个“发言人”说，佛罗里达半岛上的其它一些港口，以及墨西哥、尼加拉瓜和巴拿马等国的港口也将用来作为进攻古巴的跳板。“远征军”的策源地将是多米尼加共和国。武装进攻古巴的计划还包括在古巴岛的两端和中部登陆以便“同时开辟几条战线”。这个“发言人”最后说，这些计划的直接目的是：利用7月26日那天古巴五十万农民在哈瓦那的集会来制造菲德尔·卡斯特罗的防御系统的“混乱”。
