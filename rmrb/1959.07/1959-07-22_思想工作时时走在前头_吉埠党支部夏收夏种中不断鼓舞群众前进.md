Ideological Work Always Comes First
Jibu Party Branch Continuously Encourages the Masses to Advance in the Summer Harvest and Planting

    (Our Dispatch) This reporter Liu Guanghui reports: In the current intense summer harvest and planting season, the Jibu Production Team Party Branch of Shashi People's Commune in Ganxian County, Jiangxi Province, has closely focused on ideological, production, and livelihood work, fully mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the commune members, enabling the team to complete the summer harvest and planting work quickly and well.

    During the summer harvest and planting, the Jibu Production Team Party Branch first focused on meticulous political and ideological work, enabling the commune members to maintain vigorous revolutionary drive. Before the summer harvest and planting began, some commune members, seeing that the season was earlier this year, relaxed their preparations for the harvest and planting. At this time, the Party Branch organized the commune members to conduct a large-scale debate on the topic of how to harvest and plant well, making all commune members clear about the importance of quick harvesting and threshing, harvesting well and storing well, and planting well. Afterwards, the commune members acted quickly, and the entire team promptly prepared harvesting and planting tools, cattle power, etc., ensuring that there was no shortage of weapons and no disarray in the ranks during the intense battle. After the summer harvest and planting movement began, the Party Branch immediately strengthened its leadership over the movement. The fifteen Party members of the branch formed three Party groups, going deep into the fields and working alongside the commune members, discovering and solving problems while setting an example in labor, driving the commune members to work hard and skillfully. Female Communist Party member Yin Yujin led eight women in creating a record of harvesting nineteen dan of rice on the first day of the harvest, surpassing the men's group. The Party Branch commended Yin Yujin's group the next day and organized the male and female groups to compete with Yin Yujin's group. In this way, the entire team immediately launched a competition craze to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced. On the third day, the work efficiency of the entire team increased by nearly doubled, with an average of twenty-nine dan of rice harvested per group per day. After the end of the summer harvest, some commune members developed a "breather" mentality, advocating for a few days of rest before starting to plant late rice. After discovering this ideological situation, the Party Branch immediately publicized the importance of seizing the time for planting, emphasizing that "spring is fought by the day, and summer is fought by the hour," enabling the entire team to quickly switch to planting and transplanting the late rice seedlings into the fields early.

    In order to maximize the role of each commune member and speed up the harvest and planting progress, the Party Branch also assisted the production team in rationally and comprehensively arranging production, mobilizing all commune members to join the battle, ensuring that there were no idlers in every household and that everything was done by someone. First, the Party Branch held a forum for commune members to solicit their opinions and suggestions on arranging labor; then, based on the opinions of the commune members, and according to the physical strength and technical expertise of each commune member, the Party Branch suggested that the production team divide the entire team of more than one thousand laborers into harvesting, drying, plowing, water management, logistics and other groups. Auxiliary laborers and children were formed into gleaning and harvesting grass groups. Production tasks were contracted to each group, dividing labor and responsibilities. After such a scientific division of labor, each commune member could fully exert their strength, and it ensured that everything was done by someone and the production order was orderly. Secondly, on the basis of a comprehensive arrangement of labor, reasonable labor quotas were determined according to the principle of "distribution according to labor." The Party Branch assisted the production team in fully mobilizing commune members to discuss this issue, in order to make the quota calculation more reasonable. After the discussion, the production team determined the labor quota according to the opinions of the commune members, and then everyone jointly implemented it after the commune members passed it at a meeting. The labor quotas formulated in this way satisfied every commune member, and they were even more motivated to produce. In order to reach the quota, some commune members worked day and night, working until ten o'clock in the evening and going to the fields again at four o'clock the next morning. They said: "The quota calculation is reasonable, so we must work harder." In addition, the Party Branch also organized an inspection team with the participation of experienced farmers to check the progress and quality of harvesting and planting plot by plot, and immediately suggested that the production team discuss and resolve any problems found, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of the summer harvest and planting.

    "The Communist Party cares for us meticulously everywhere, and we become more and more energetic as we work." This is a heartfelt remark made by the commune members of the Jibu Production Team after their lives were cared for by the Party Branch. The more intense the work, the more the Party Branch paid attention to the commune members' eating, drinking, rest, and sleep. Before the summer planting, the Party Branch assisted the production team leaders in rectifying the canteen and nursery, and prepared the firewood, rice, vegetables, oil, and salt needed during the harvest and planting; during the production gap, it promptly gave the entire team three days off, allowing the commune members to arrange household affairs, so as to better participate in the harvest and planting. During the harvest and planting, the canteen cooks delivered meals, vegetables, water, and cigarettes to the fields. Party Branch Secretary Wang Shichun and five Party Branch members often asked about and helped commune members solve problems in their lives while working with the commune members, and often went deep into the commune members' families in the evening to ask about their well-being and check on their sleep and rest. Because the commune members ate well, drank well, slept well, and rested well, everyone was full of energy and wholeheartedly participated in the rush harvest and planting, and the entire team was fully staffed every day.

    思想工作时时走在前头
    吉埠党支部夏收夏种中不断鼓舞群众前进
    本报讯　记者刘光辉报道：在当前紧张的夏收夏种中，江西赣县沙石公社吉埠生产队党支部紧紧抓住思想、生产、生活三项工作，充分调动了社员们的生产积极性，使全队夏收夏种工作完成得既快又好。
    在夏收夏种中，吉埠生产队党支部首先抓住了细致的政治思想工作，使社员们经常保持着旺盛的革命干劲。在开展夏收夏种之前，部分社员看到今年季节提早，就放松了收种准备工作。这时，党支部便组织社员开展了以怎样收好种好为专题的大辩论，使全体社员明确了快收快打、收好藏好和种好的重要意义。之后，社员迅速行动起来，全队及时地把收种工具、牛力等准备妥当，保证在紧张的战斗中武器不缺、队伍不乱。夏收夏种运动开始后，党支部立即加强了对运动的领导，支部的十五个党员组成三个党小组，分头深入田间和社员同劳动，一面发现和解决问题，一面在劳动中起带头示范作用，带动社员苦干巧干。女共产党员尹玉金带领八个妇女在抢收的第一天创造了一个小组收割十九担稻谷的纪录，赛过了男子组。党支部第二天便表扬了尹玉金小组，并组织各男、女小组同尹玉金小组竞赛。这样，全队立即掀起了学先进、赶先进、超先进的竞赛热潮。第三天，全队工作效率就提高了近一倍，平均每个小组每天收割二十九担稻谷。在结束夏收之后，部分社员产生了“松口气”的思想，主张休息几天再动手种晚稻。党支部发现这种思想情况后，马上向社员宣传了“春争日、夏争时”的抢种的重要性，使全队人马迅速转入了抢种，把晚稻秧苗提早插到了田里。
    为了发挥每一个社员的最大作用，加快收种进度，党支部还协助生产队合理地全面安排生产，调动全队社员上阵，做到了家家无闲人，事事有人做。首先，党支部召开社员座谈会，广泛征求了社员对安排劳动力的意见和建议；然后根据社员们的意见，按照各个社员的身体强弱、技术特长，建议生产队将全队一千多个劳力分别组成收割、晒谷、犁耙、管水、后勤等小组。对附带劳动力、小孩便组成捡穗、收禾草小组。分组分工包干生产任务。这样科学分工后，每个社员都能充分发挥自己的力量，并且保证了项项生产有人做，生产秩序有条不紊。其次，在全面安排劳力的基础上，按照“按劳分配”的原则确定合理的劳动定额。党支部协助生产队充分发动社员对这一问题进行讨论，以求定额计酬更加合理。讨论后，生产队依照社员意见确定劳动定额，再经过社员们开会通过后大家共同执行。这样制定的劳动定额，社员们个个满意，生产干劲更大。有的社员为了达到定额，日干夜干，晚上劳动到十点钟收工，第二天清晨四点钟又下田生产。他们说：“定额计酬合理，更要加油干。”此外，党支部还组织了有老农参加的检查组，逐丘逐块检查收种进度、质量，发现问题立即建议生产队讨论解决，从而保证了夏收夏种的顺利进行。
      “共产党处处细心关怀我们，我们越干越有劲。”是吉埠生产队社员们生活得到党支部的关怀后说出的一句心里话。工作愈紧张，党支部愈注意关心社员的吃、喝、休息和睡眠。夏种前，党支部协助生产队领导整顿了食堂、托儿所，准备了收种期间需要的柴、米、菜、油、盐；利用生产空隙，及时给全队放了三天假，让社员们安排了家务事情，以便更好地参加收种。收种期间，食堂炊事员把饭、菜、水、烟都送到田间。党支部书记王诗椿和五个党支部委员在和社员一同劳动中，都经常询问并帮助社员解决生活上的问题，晚上还常常深入到社员家庭中问寒问暖，检查社员睡眠休息情况。由于社员吃好、喝好、睡好、休息好，个个体力充沛，一心一意参加抢收抢种，全队天天出满勤。
