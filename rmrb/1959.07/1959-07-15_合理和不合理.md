    Reasonable and Unreasonable
    Wang Guo

    After reading the two articles in the People's Daily, "Proportion and Timing" and "Whether It’s Dense or Not, Look at the Facts" (see pages 8 of the June 18th and 21st issues, respectively), I was quite enlightened. Both articles started with the discussion of rational close planting. This made me think about the issue of "reasonable" versus "unreasonable."

    Generally, when people offer ideas and handle affairs, there are two situations: one is reasonable, and the other is unreasonable. "Those who follow reason succeed, and those who go against reason fail." For example, in agricultural production, we advocate rational close planting, rational fertilization, rational irrigation...; in distribution issues, we advocate rationally determining the proportion of accumulation and consumption; in labor management, we advocate rational organization and use of labor; in people's lives, we advocate rational work and rest. Emphasizing rationality can be said to be the characteristic of Marxist handling affairs, and it is also the reason why our cause is ever-victorious.

    When I say that we pay the most attention to rationality when offering ideas and handling affairs, it does not mean that 100% of us have mastered the ability to handle affairs rationally, nor does it mean that all the ideas we offer and all the things we do are always 100% rational. Among us, there are indeed a few people who are often not rational enough when offering ideas and handling affairs. For example, some people shake their heads at the mention of close planting, as if the old rules of sparse planting passed down from their ancestors are inviolable; others go to the other extreme, regardless of the circumstances, advocating "the denser the better." So, when you say they are unreasonable, they turn around and say you are unreasonable. This is somewhat like "everyone affirms what they affirm and denies what they deny, so who is right?"

    In fact, the standard of rationality is the Marxist standard of truth. "The criterion for judging whether a piece of knowledge or theory is truth is not determined by subjective feelings, but by the results of objective social practice. The only criterion for truth is social practice." ("On Practice") This makes people "suddenly see the light": it turns out that the "reason" in reasonable and unreasonable refers to the regularity of the objective world. If what you subjectively think and do conforms to this regularity, works well, and produces good results, then it is reasonable; otherwise, it is unreasonable.

    Of course, due to differences in time, place, and conditions, some things that seem reasonable in one place may become unreasonable in another; what seemed reasonable yesterday may not be reasonable today. To absolutely define the rationality and irrationality of everything is also bound to lead to setbacks.

### 合理和不合理

    合理和不合理
    王果
    看了人民日报上“分寸和火候”和“密不密，看事实”两篇文章（分别见6月18日和21日8版），对我颇有启发。那两篇文章都是从合理密植说起的。我就想到了“合理”与“不合理”的问题。
    大凡人们出主意、办事情，总有两种情形：一种是合理，另一种是不合理。“顺乎理者成，逆乎理者败。”比如，在农业生产方面，我们主张合理密植、合理施肥、合理灌溉……；在分配问题上，我们主张合理规定积累和消费的比例；在劳动管理上，我们主张合理组织和使用劳力；在群众生活上，我们主张合理劳动和休息。讲究合理，可以说是马克思主义者办事情的特色，也是我们的事业战无不胜的原因所在。
    我说我们出主意、办事情最讲究合理，并不等于说我们百分之百的人都掌握了合理办事的本领，不等于说我们出的一切主意，办的一切事情从来都是百分之百的合理，我们当中，的确也有少数人，出主意，办事情往往是不够合理的。例如：有一种人一提到密植，就摇头，似乎祖传下来的稀植的老规程是天经地义的，丝毫动不得；另一种人却走到另一个极端，不管三七二十一，来个“越密越好”。就这样，你说他们不合理，他们还反过来说你不合理。这很有些“人各其是所是而其非所非，将谁是正之”的样子。
    其实，合理的标准，也就是马克思主义关于真理的标准。“判定认识或理论之是否真理，不是依主观上觉得如何而定，而是依客观上社会实践的结果如何而定。真理的标准只能是社会的实践。”（“实践论”）这就叫人“顿开茅塞”了：原来，合理与不合理的“理”字，就是客观世界的规律性，你主观上想的、干的符合这个规律性，行得通、结果好，就是合理，反之，就是不合理。
    当然，由于时间、地点、条件不同，有些事情在这个地方看来是合理的，但在那个地方就可能成为不合理；在昨天看来是合理的，在今天就未必合理，把一切事情的合理和不合理都绝对化起来，也是要碰钉子的。
