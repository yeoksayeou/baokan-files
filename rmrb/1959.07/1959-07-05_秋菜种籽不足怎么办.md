What to do about insufficient autumn vegetable seeds
By a commentator of this newspaper

The sowing of autumn vegetables is about to begin. Solving the problem of autumn vegetable seeds is the prerequisite for realizing the autumn vegetable sowing plan, and it is a major matter related to the vegetable consumption of the broad masses of people this winter and next spring. Therefore, agricultural and commercial departments in various regions need to start making arrangements immediately to ensure the complete realization of the autumn vegetable production plan.

In order to meet the ever-growing needs of the broad masses of people for vegetables, the acreage for autumn vegetables sown this year will be greatly increased in various regions. According to statistics from forty-five cities including Beijing, Tianjin, and Xi'an, the planned acreage for autumn vegetables sown this year is 73% higher than last year. Therefore, the demand for vegetable seeds will also increase accordingly. However, seed work was not generally arranged in various regions last year. In addition, many regions suffered from autumn vegetable disasters, and there were not enough selected and retained mother plants. Vegetable seed production has not kept up in a timely manner, coupled with the spring drought and other natural disasters this year, which have affected the production of autumn vegetable seeds to a certain extent. Many provinces and cities feel that seeds are insufficient. The vegetable seeds produced in some provinces and cities can only meet about 40% of the autumn vegetable sowing needs, and at most they can only meet about 80%; the situation of insufficient vegetable seeds is even more prominent in some new industrial and mining cities and areas where new vegetable fields have been expanded more. The contradiction between the development of autumn vegetable production and the shortage of vegetable seeds is seriously affecting the completion of the autumn sowing plan. Close attention must be paid to this issue, and it must be resolved quickly.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient autumn vegetable seeds this year, the first thing to do is to mobilize the masses to collect all kinds of autumn vegetable seeds, thresh them thoroughly, and strive for every seed to return home. Now, collecting one more seed will result in one more vegetable in the fall; if everyone can collect carefully and thresh finely, and count every seed, accumulating a little can expand a lot of vegetable fields. Secondly, the vegetable seeds scattered among the masses should be purchased. According to investigations in many regions, the potential in this area is still very large. In addition to actively mobilizing the masses to sell their accumulated vegetable seeds to the state, people's communes and supply and marketing departments in various regions should also seriously check their warehouses. The four production brigades of the Shijingshan People's Commune in Beijing checked out 7,500 jin of various vegetable seeds from the warehouse, and in addition to their own use, they also supported other communes with more than 1,000 jin. Many other regions have similar situations. As long as everyone does this work conscientiously, many ways can be found.

Saving seeds is also an important way to solve the problem of seed shortage. Saving vegetable seeds should be approached from two aspects. One aspect is to improve sowing methods, that is, to minimize the area of direct sowing as much as possible, and change direct sowing to seedling cultivation and transplanting, and change row sowing to spot sowing. According to the experience of vegetable farmers, using this method, one jin of Chinese cabbage seeds can be planted on nine mu, while using the direct sowing method, one jin can only be planted on three mu. The other aspect is adjustment, that is, provinces and cities that produce relatively abundant vegetable seeds, or places that can save seeds through careful calculation and have surplus seeds, should give play to the spirit of cooperation and squeeze out some vegetable seeds to support seed-deficient areas. With the efforts and arrangements of all parties, the problem of insufficient autumn vegetable seeds may be solved.

With the development of vegetable production, in the case of insufficient seeds, agricultural and commercial departments must further improve cooperation. Agricultural departments should strengthen technical guidance and think of more ways to save seeds. Commercial departments should strengthen the purchase and adjustment of seeds. In order to do a good job in purchasing, it is necessary to start immediately, seize the harvest season of autumn vegetable seeds, change the method of purchasing by waiting for people to come to the door, send people to the production teams to collect, and accept everyone who comes, no matter how much or how little. After the vegetable seeds are purchased, they should be immediately transferred directly to areas lacking vegetable seeds according to prior arrangements. As for the purchase price of vegetable seeds, commercial departments must conduct a quick inspection, and areas with prices that are too low must be adjusted. A price level that enables producers to have reasonable income must be stipulated.

In order to do a good job in adjustment, agricultural and commercial departments should thoroughly arrange the issue of saving the use of autumn vegetable seeds. Provinces and cities that originally had tasks of transferring out should strive to transfer out more to support other places. Organizing mutual adjustment and exchanging what one has for what one lacks is also one of the ways to solve the problem of seed shortage. However, according to the situation of insufficient seeds this year, it is necessary to implement the policy of self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use as the main focus, supplemented by adjustment, and not rely solely on allocation and adjustment. In order to ensure the development of autumn vegetable production next year, when arranging autumn vegetable production this year, all localities should consider the issue of seed retention, specifically allocate a certain amount of land, cultivate a sufficient number of mother plants, and prepare for next year's vegetable seed production.

Chinese farmers have a saying: Radishes in the first dog days, vegetables in the second dog days, and Chinese cabbage around the Beginning of Autumn. Now that the summer solstice has passed, the hot days and the Beginning of Autumn season are coming soon, and the sowing of autumn vegetables will also begin. All localities should make practical and early arrangements based on the autumn vegetable sowing plan and seed situation, do a good job in preparation, save seeds, and use all means to ensure the completion of the autumn vegetable sowing plan.

    秋菜种籽不足怎么办
    本报评论员
    秋菜播种转眼就要开始了。解决秋菜种籽问题，是实现秋菜播种计划的前提，是关系今冬明春广大人民吃菜问题的一件大事情。因此，各地农业部门和商业部门需要立即着手安排，以保证秋菜生产计划的完满实现。
    为了满足广大人民对蔬菜日益增长的需要，今年各地秋菜播种面积将有很大的增加。据北京、天津、西安等四十五个城市的统计，今年秋菜播种面积计划比去年增加73％。因此，菜籽的需要量也要相应地增加。但是，去年各地普遍没有安排种籽工作，再加许多地区秋菜遭灾，选留母株不足，菜籽生产没有及时跟上，加上今年春旱以及其它自然灾害，致使秋菜籽的生产受了一定的影响。许多省市感到种籽不足。有些省、市生产的菜籽只能满足秋菜播种需要的40％左右，最多的也只能满足80％左右；一些新的工矿城市及新菜田扩大较多的地区，菜籽不足的情况更加突出。发展秋菜生产和菜籽不足的矛盾，严重地影响着秋播计划的完成。对这个问题必须密切注意，迅速解决。
    为了解决今年秋菜籽不足问题，首先要发动群众把各种秋菜籽全部收好打净，力争颗粒还家。现在多收一颗籽，秋后就能多收一颗菜；如果大家都能够精收细打，粒粒计较，集少成多，就能扩大不少菜田。其次，要把分散在群众手中的菜籽收购起来。据许多地区的调查，这方面的潜力还是很大的。各地人民公社和供销部门除了应积极动员群众把积存的菜籽卖给国家以外，还应该认真清查一下仓库。北京市石景山人民公社四个生产大队就从仓库里清查出各种菜籽七千五百斤，除自用以外还支援了其它公社一千多斤。其它不少地区也有类似情况。只要大家认真做好这项工作，就可以找出不少门路。
    节约用种也是解决菜籽不足问题的一个重要办法。节约菜籽要从两方面着手。一方面是改进播种方法，就是尽量缩小直播面积，改直播为先育苗后移栽，改条播为点种。根据菜农的经验，采用这个办法，一斤白菜籽可以种九亩，而用直播办法，一斤只能种三亩。另一方面是调剂，就是生产菜籽比较丰足的省、市，或经过精打细算能够节约用种使种籽有余的地方，发挥协作精神，挤出一部分菜籽支援缺种地区。这样经过各方面的努力和安排，秋菜籽不足的问题就有可能解决。
    随着蔬菜生产的发展，在种籽不足的情况下，农商部门必须进一步搞好协作。农业部门要加强技术指导，多想些节约用种的办法。商业部门要加强种籽的收购和调剂工作。为了作好收购工作，应该立即动手，抓住秋菜籽收获季节，改变坐等上门的收购方法，派人深入到生产队去收，来者不拒，多少都收。菜籽收购起来以后，要立即根据事先的安排，直接调运到缺菜籽的地区。至于菜籽的收购价格，商业部门要迅速进行一次检查，偏低的地区必须加以调整。要规定一个能够使生产者有合理收入的价格水平。
    为了作好调剂工作，农业和商业部门要彻底安排一下秋菜籽的节约使用问题。原来有调出任务的省、市，应该争取多调出一些支援外地。组织互相调剂，互通有无，也是解决种籽不足问题的办法之一。但是，根据今年种籽不足的情况，必须贯彻执行以自繁、自选、自留、自用为主，辅之以调剂的方针，而不能单纯依靠调拨调剂。为了保证明年秋菜生产的发展，各地在安排今年秋菜生产的时候，要把留种问题考虑进去，专门划出一定数量的土地，培育足够数量的母株，给明年的菜籽生产作好准备。
    我国农民有句谚语：头伏萝卜二伏菜，立秋前后种白菜。现在夏至已过，暑天和立秋季节很快就要到来，秋菜的播种也将开始。各地应该根据秋菜的播种计划和菜籽情况切实及早地加以安排，做好准备工作，节约菜籽，用尽一切办法保证完成秋菜播种计划。
