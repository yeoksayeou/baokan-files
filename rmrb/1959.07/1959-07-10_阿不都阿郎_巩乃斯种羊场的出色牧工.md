Abudu Alang is a herdsman at the Gongnais Stud Farm on the Ili grassland. For more than six years, he has meticulously raised and cultivated stud sheep, continuously improving the lambing survival rate and consistently setting high production records, establishing a red flag for livestock production on the fertile Ili grassland. According to statistics from 1953 to 1958, he averaged over 350 sheep grazed per year and 2,336 lambs raised (excluding this year's early spring lambs). The Xinjiang fine-wool sheep he cultivated have exceeded the set targets for weight and wool yield every year. The lambing survival rate has also been rising: 120% in 1954, increasing to 151% in 1958. In the continuing Great Leap Forward of 1959, the early spring lambs achieved another bumper harvest, with 316 lambs born from a flock of 200 ewes, including 113 sets of twins and two sets of triplets, a lambing rate of 156.5%, setting the farm's highest record in history.

Abudu Alang was born into a poor herdsman's family. He is 40 years old, of Kazakh ethnicity, and joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1956. He has been named an advanced producer of the farm four times, an advanced producer of the autonomous region in 1957, and was awarded the title of National Model Worker in 1958, and received an award from the Ministry of Agriculture.

Abudu Alang, filled with passion for the socialist cause, pays close attention to learning from others and often actively exchanges experiences with other herdsmen. He also works hard to study his profession. To achieve his high-yield bumper harvest plan, he selected a small group of ewes and grazed them in pastures with different grass qualities to understand the effect of feeding on the estrus of the sheep. The results showed that sheep grazing in dry reed areas gained weight slowly, with only one or two exhibiting estrus. Sheep grazing on the lush green grassland near the riverbank gained weight quickly, with fifty exhibiting estrus. He summarized this experience and further improved his grazing methods. The weight of the sheep generally increased, all exhibited estrus, and the conception rate reached 100%, resulting in a bumper harvest the following year. Other herdsmen who learned from his experience have also achieved good results.

The phenomenon of "suspended animation" in newborn lambs has a significant impact on the harvest. To solve this problem, he consulted veterinarians and other herdsmen, absorbing scientific knowledge, while also studying and analyzing in actual production, summarizing lessons, and accumulating experience. As a result, he mastered the technique of saving lambs from death. In recent years, he has saved many lambs using artificial respiration and other methods.

Now, Abudu Alang has put forward an accelerated plan to increase sheep production by 300% within the year, aiming to develop 200 ewes into a "high-yield flock" of 600 sheep. More than 200 herdsmen on the farm have also put forward the slogan of learning from and surpassing Abudu Alang, aiming to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day with outstanding achievements in creating high yields and bumper harvests and cultivating more and better Xinjiang fine-wool sheep for the motherland.

    阿不都阿郎
    巩乃斯种羊场的出色牧工
    阿不都阿郎是伊犁草原上巩乃斯种羊场的牧工。六年多来，他精心饲养和培育种羊，不断提高羊只繁殖成活率，连续创造高产纪录，在富饶的伊犁草原上树起了一面牧业生产的红旗。根据1953年至1958年统计，他平均每年牧放羊三百五十余只，育羔二千三百三十六只（不包括今年的早春羔）；由他培育成长的新疆细毛羊，体重和产毛量每年都超过规定指标；繁殖成活率也一直上升：1954年为120％，1958年提高到151％。在继续大跃进的1959年，早春羔又获得大丰收，全群二百只母羊产羔三百一十六只，其中双羔一百一十三只，三胎两只，繁殖率达156.5％，创造了该场历史上的最高纪录。
    阿不都阿郎出生于贫苦的牧工家庭，现年四十岁，哈萨克族，1956年加入中国共产党，曾四次被评为场的先进生产者，1957年被评为自治区先进生产者，1958年荣获全国劳动模范称号，并受到中央农业部的奖励。
    对社会主义事业充满激情的阿不都阿郎，平时很注意学习别人的长处，经常主动和其他牧工交流经验，也能下苦工钻研业务。为了实现高产丰收计划，他选出一小群母羊，牧放在草质不同的草场上，了解饲养对羊只发情的作用。观察结果，牧放在干枯芦草地带的羊上膘慢，发情的只有一、两只；放在靠河岸附近嫩绿草地的羊上膘快，发情的有五十只。他总结了这个经验，进一步改进了牧放方法，羊的体重普遍增加，全部发情，受胎率达100％，第二年获得丰产。其他牧工学习了他的经验，都收到了良好的效果。
    羊羔出生后的“假死”现象，对丰收很有影响。为了解决这个问题，他一面向兽医和其他牧工请教，吸取科学知识；一面在实际生产中研究分析，总结教训，积累经验，因而掌握了从死亡中挽救羊羔的技术。几年来，他用人工呼吸等办法救活了不少羊羔。
    现在，阿不都阿郎又提出了年内增产羊只300％的跃进计划，要使二百只母羊发展成为一个拥有六百只羊的“高产群”。全场二百余名牧工，也提出了学习和赶过阿不都阿郎的口号，要以创造高产丰收，为祖国培育更多更好的新疆细毛羊的出色成绩，迎接国庆十周年。
