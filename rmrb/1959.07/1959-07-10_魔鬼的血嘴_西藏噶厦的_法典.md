In the gloomy "Chen Kang" (court) of the former Tibetan local government, the iron windows on the brown stone walls were unusually narrow, unable to even let the wind in. Rows of whips, wooden sticks, and iron shackles hung from the blood-red pillars, and a large pile of fetters, handcuffs, and iron chains lay in the dark corners of the room... In each "Chen Kang," there was a silk-covered, hand-copied book, its cover greasy and blackened from being touched and rubbed. This was the "treasure" of the Tibetan serf owners, called "Chen Yi" - the legal code of the former Tibetan local government (Kashag). The full text consisted of sixteen articles, totaling about ten thousand words. For more than a thousand years, only individual clauses of this "code" had been changed. Its basic aspects, that is, the various provisions for brutally and barbarously persecuting Tibetan serfs, had not been altered in the slightest. The former Tibetan local government used this "code" to harm countless innocent Tibetan people! The Tibetan people angrily called it "the devil's bloody mouth."

The basic principle of the "code" was to protect the interests of the serf owners and the strict hierarchical system of Tibetan society. Article 7 of the "code" strictly divided Tibetans into three classes and nine grades: "People are divided into upper, middle, and lower classes, and each class is further divided into upper, middle, and lower grades. These upper, middle, and lower classes are determined by their noble or humble lineage, high or low position, and the importance of their work." The upper class referred to the extremely small number of great nobles, great Living Buddhas, and high-ranking officials in Tibet. The middle class referred to general monastic and secular officials, lower-ranking Tibetan military officers, and the henchmen raised by the Tibetan government, monasteries, and nobles. The lower class referred to the serfs, who accounted for 95% of the total Tibetan population, who were oppressed and exploited. The level of the lower class was determined by the amount of property each person possessed. The "code" proceeded from this unreasonable and unequal hierarchy to implement a tyrannical rule over the vast Tibetan people.

The "code" did not provide any guarantee for the safety of life or property of the lower classes. They could be arrested and killed at any time on a trumped-up charge. Even shouting "injustice" was illegal for persecuted serfs. Article 3 of the "code," "Law of Arrest," stipulated: "Shouting grievances to the palace is improper and should be arrested and beaten; those who do not obey the master should be arrested; those who spy on the master's important matters should be arrested; those who collide with officials should be arrested; those who are junior officials fighting with senior officials should be arrested; other arrests should be made at discretion..." A woman named Yangjin Lamu, whom the reporter interviewed in Lhasa, had been beaten all over her body for resisting the insult of a headman. Yangjin Lamu then complained to the Tibetan government, but instead of "redressing her grievances," the Tibetan government arrested her and locked her up in prison for eight days, torturing her to the point of death.

The "upper class," which accounted for no more than 5% of the total Tibetan population, was sacred and inviolable in the "code." If serfs "violated" the interests of the serf owners, the "Chen Kang" (court) of the former Tibetan local government could, according to the provisions of Article 4 of the "code," "depending on the circumstances, gouge out their eyes, cut off their leg meat, cut out their tongues, chop off their hands, push them off cliffs, throw them into the water, or kill them, to warn others against following their example." Serfs in various places complained that some serf owners would gouge out the eyes of serfs who happened to witness the serf owners raping serfs' wives and daughters, accusing them of "spying on the master's important matters"; serfs who accidentally revealed the serf owners' dirty scandals would have their tongues cut out. Not long ago, when the reporter interviewed the Tibet Branch of the Supreme People's Court, he saw in the office some of the evidence of the serf owners' crimes against the people, which had just been seized from the interrogation rooms of "Xue Lie Kong" (the former Tibetan local government agency managing some of the zong near Lhasa, equivalent to a prefecture) and "Langzi Xia" (the former Lhasa municipal government). In a large wooden box, there were several pieces of rotten human flesh, pieces of human skin, and many human arms, some chopped off at the elbow, some cut off at the shoulder, and some with only a hand left, already dried and blackened, but still stained with blood, which was shocking.

Tibetan serf owners could arbitrarily injure or even execute serfs, but if serfs resisted in self-defense, it was an "unforgivable" "serious crime." Article 8 of the "code" stated: "Although the law stipulates that for those who cause an upper-class person to bleed, a fine of one qian (referring to silver) shall be imposed for each drop of blood, and for those who cause a lower-class person to bleed, a fine of one fen (referring to silver) shall be imposed for each drop of blood. However, in the case of unequal status, if a subordinate rebels against a superior and causes injury, if the injury is minor, the assailant should be punished with corporal punishment. If a superior accidentally injures a subordinate, the offender shall only be responsible for providing medical treatment out of conscience. In the case of master and servant, there is no precedent for compensation." In practice, serf owners did not have to "compensate" for injuring serfs, let alone for killing them. Serfs in the Gyantse area recently revealed that the large serf owner Pala Wangqiu, who had already joined the rebellion, often tortured serfs to death.

This "code" made detailed provisions for the protection of the serf owners' property and rights, including a special "law to prevent theft." In fact, the Tibetan serf owners' plunder of serfs was more ruthless than that of bandits. The amount of exploitation generally accounted for more than 70% of the serfs' total income, leaving the vast majority of serfs starving and cold, unable to guarantee even the most basic food and clothing. The "code" stipulated that "stealing the property of the Wangye (referring to the supreme ruler of Tibet) shall be fined ten thousand times, and stealing the property of monks, monasteries, Buddhas, etc., shall be fined eighty times. Stealing the property of ordinary people shall be fined seven times." The "code" also stipulated that "those who steal the property of the Wangye shall be sentenced to death and their property confiscated." According to Qiangzuo Awang, the "Zhongze" (secretary) of the former Tibetan local government's Heihe General Management Office, in the three years he served as "Zhongze," he personally witnessed some herdsmen who took a few pieces of milk residue or a few meat bones from their masters due to hunger being killed as "thieves" every year. According to statistics, the Heihe Zong (county) government alone had more than twenty kinds of criminal laws specifically designed to deal with "theft." The lightest punishment was to brand the forehead of the criminal with a red-hot iron, and then carve the word "dog" on it, subjecting him to lifelong insult and discrimination. When the reporter interviewed in the Heihe area in recent years, he saw several times the hands and heads of so-called "thieves" hanging at the gate of the former Zong government for "public display," dripping with blood, which was appalling.

The Tibetan serf owners' obscene and shameless bestial acts were protected by the "code." Article 12 of the "code" stipulated that for women from lower-class families, "if a man attempts to rape a woman and fails because the woman refuses, the woman shall be fined one qian (referring to gold dust)," and the man shall only be fined five gifts; "if the rape is successful," in addition to the man being fined, "the woman shall still be fined three qian (referring to gold dust)."

In order to make the innocent serfs who were accused "willing" to "confess" and "submit to the law," Article 9 of the "code" also contained an extremely absurd and cruel provision: "Judging deception by oath." "For those who swear an oath, the judge shall, according to the law, boil oil in an iron pot and place a black and white stone in the oil. Both parties shall prepare invocations, and the official shall recite them three times to communicate with the spirits... Then, one party of the oath-takers shall put his hand into the oil pot to retrieve the stone... If he retrieves the white stone without being injured, he shall be deemed truthful and innocent." Many innocent serfs, under the coercion of the serf owners, had to swear oaths to prove their innocence, and as a result, their hands were scorched by boiling oil, and some even lost their lives. Even so, they could not escape the "charge" because a person who was "burned" was not considered "truthful and innocent."

In fact, this "code" far from fully demonstrates the brutality of the Tibetan serf owners. It was merely a programmatic regulation. Tibetan monasteries could formulate detailed "monastery rules" based on the "code," and nobles could formulate detailed "family laws" in their own estates. These "monastery rules" and "family laws" were generally stricter and more cruel than the provisions of the "code." Now, with the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, the Tibetan people have been liberated from the evil rule of this "code." The Tibetan people are now demanding that this "code" be explicitly abolished, completely shaking off the shackles of the serf system, and moving towards the road of democracy and freedom.

    魔鬼的血嘴——西藏噶厦的“法典”
    新华社记者　郭超人
    在阴森森的原西藏地方政府的“称康”（法庭）里，褐色的石墙上铁窗异常狭小，连风都无法吹进，血红色的柱梁上挂着一排皮鞭、木棍和铁枷，黑沉沉的屋角里摆着一大堆脚镣、手铐和铁链……。在各个“称康”里，都有一部绸面手抄的书册，它的封面已被摸揉得油腻而发黑，这就是西藏农奴主的“镇山之宝”，名字叫“称依”——原西藏地方政府（噶厦）的法典。全文共十六条，约一万字。这部“法典”一千多年以来，只是个别条文上有过更动，它的基本方面，即残暴、野蛮地迫害西藏农奴的各项规定，却没有丝毫改变。原西藏地方政府运用这部“法典”，不知残害了多少无辜的西藏人民！西藏人民激愤地把它叫作“魔鬼的血嘴”。
    “法典”的基本根据就是保护农奴主的利益和西藏社会森严的等级制度。“法典”第七条把西藏人严格地划为三等九级：“人分上中下三等，每一等人又分上中下三级。此上中下三等系就其血统贵贱职位高低办事大小而定。”上等人是指西藏为数极少的大贵族、大活佛和高级官员等，中等人指一般僧俗官员、藏军下级军官，以及藏政府、寺院和贵族所豢养的爪牙，下等人指的是占西藏总人口95％的被压迫被剥削的农奴，下等人中间等级的高低，又凭各人财产的多少来决定。“法典”就是从这种不合理、不平等的等级出发，对广大西藏人民实行横暴的统治。
      “法典”对下等人生命、财产的安全，没有任何保障，他们随时都可能在一个“莫须有”的罪名下，遭到逮捕和杀戮，遭到迫害的农奴甚至连喊一声“冤枉”，都是非法的。“法典”第三条“拘捕之法律”规定：“向王宫喊冤，不合体统，应逮捕械击之；不受主人约束拘捕之；侦探主人要事者拘捕之；百姓碰撞官长者拘捕之；小官与大官争执者拘捕之；其余酌情拘捕。……”记者在拉萨市区访问过一个名叫央金拉姆的妇女，她曾经因为反抗一个头人的侮辱而被打得遍体鳞伤，央金拉姆当时就向藏政府控告，藏政府不但不为她“伸冤”，反而把她抓进监狱关了八天，用酷刑把她折磨得死去活来。
    占西藏总人口最多不过5％的“上等人”，在“法典”中是神圣不可侵犯的。农奴如果“触犯”了农奴主的利益，原西藏地方政府的“称康”（法庭）就可以根据“法典”第四条的规定：“按其情节不同或挖其眼睛，削其腿肉，割舌，戮手，推坠悬岩，抛入水中，或杀戮之，惩戒将来，以免效尤。”各地的农奴控诉说，有些农奴主在强奸农奴的妻女时被农奴撞见，农奴主便以“侦探主人要事”的罪名，把农奴的眼珠挖掉；农奴偶然泄露了农奴主的肮脏丑事，就要被农奴主割掉舌头。不久以前，记者到最高人民法院西藏分院采访，在办公室里就看到刚从“雪列空”（原西藏地方政府管理拉萨附近一些宗的机构，相当于专署）和“郎子辖”（原拉萨市政府）的审讯室里缴获的一部分农奴主残害人民的罪证。在一个大木箱里，装着几块已经腐烂的人肉，一张张的人皮，还有许多只人的臂膀，有的是齐肘砍掉，有的是齐肩割的，有的光剩一个手掌，已经风干变黑，但还可以看到斑斑的血污，令人触目惊心。
    西藏农奴主们可以任意将农奴打伤以至处死，但是，如果农奴为了自卫而进行反抗，则是“无可赦免”的“重罪”。“法典”的第八条说：“律文中虽规定对于使上等人出血者，每滴血罚金一钱，对于使下等人出血者，每滴血罚金一分。但是在身份不相等的情况，以下叛上而致伤者，若创伤较小，应对行凶人处以肉刑，由上对下若因失手而致对方受伤，则只由失手者凭良心请送治疗将养外，在主仆情况下无有赔偿之例规。”在实际生活中，农奴主别说把农奴打伤不用“赔偿”，就是打死了也不负任何责任。江孜地区的农奴不久前揭露说，已参加叛乱的大农奴主帕拉·汪秋就经常将农奴拷打致死。
    这个“法典”对保护农奴主的财产和权益作了详尽的规定，其中还专门定有“防止偷盗的法律”。其实，西藏农奴主对农奴的掠夺比强盗还要凶狠，剥削量一般要占到农奴总收入的70％以上，使广大农奴饥寒交迫，连最起码的衣食都无法保证。“法典”规定“偷盗王爷（指西藏最高统治者）财物罚一万倍，偷盗僧侣、寺庙、佛像等财物罚八十倍。偷平常人的财物罚七倍。”“法典”还规定“偷盗王爷财物者处以死刑，没收其财产。”据原西藏地方政府黑河总管府的“仲泽”（秘书）强佐阿旺告诉记者说，在他担任“仲泽”的三年来，每年都亲眼看到一些牧民在饥饿逼迫下拿了主人几块奶渣、几根肉骨头，就被当作“偷盗犯”而杀害。据统计，原黑河宗（县）政府专门对付“偷盗”的刑法就在二十种以上，最轻的刑法是用烧红的铁印在犯人额前打一个烙痕，再刻上一个“狗”字，使之终身蒙受侮辱和歧视。记者最近几年在黑河地区采访时，曾几次看到原宗政府门口悬挂着“示众”的所谓“偷盗犯”的双手和头颅，鲜血淋淋，惨不忍睹。
    西藏农奴主荒淫无耻的兽行，都受到“法典”的保护。“法典”第十二条规定：对于下等人家的妇女，“男子欲强奸而遭妇女拒绝未遂者，罚女方一钱（指沙金）”，男方只罚五项礼物；“强奸已遂者”，除男子需罚款外，仍然罚“妇女三钱（指沙金）”。
    为了使被告的无辜农奴“甘愿”“认罪”和“伏法”，“法典”第九条还有一种极其荒诞而残暴的规定：“以发誓判断欺诳”。“凡发誓者，法官如法以铁锅熬油置黑白石各一枚于油中，两方各备祝文，凭官朗诵三遍以通神灵，……然后由发誓者之一方以手入油锅内，探取石子……如取得白石而不受伤者即认为真实无过。”许多无辜农奴在农奴主威逼下，只好发誓来表示自己的清白，结果双手被滚油烧焦，有些甚至丧失了生命。尽管如此，他们仍然不能解脱“罪名”，因为“炙伤”了的人就不是“真实无过”的。
    实际上，这个“法典”远远不能说明西藏农奴主的残暴。它只不过是一个纲领性的规定，西藏的寺院可以根据“法典”制定详细的“寺规”，贵族可以在自己的庄园里制定详细的“家法”。这些“寺规”和“家法”，一般都比“法典”的规定更加严密和残酷。现在，随着西藏叛乱的平息，西藏人民才从这个“法典”的罪恶统治下解放出来。西藏人民目前纷纷要求明令废除这个“法典”，彻底摆脱农奴制度的束缚，走向民主自由的道路。
