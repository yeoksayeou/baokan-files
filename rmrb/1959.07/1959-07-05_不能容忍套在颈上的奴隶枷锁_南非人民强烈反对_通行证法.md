Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, July 4th: The South African white government's "Pass Laws" are a slave's yoke around the necks of the South African people. The South African people are intensifying their struggle to make 1959 the greatest year in South African history for the fight against the "Pass Laws".

　　The "Pass Laws" are an important law of racial discrimination enacted by the fascist Malan government about ten years ago. This law is by no means to facilitate the "passage" of Africans, but to make it difficult for them to move an inch. The law stipulates that every African person over the age of sixteen must carry a large set of documents, including an "identity card", "migration certificate", "job search certificate", tax receipts... If the documents are not complete, the police will arrest them. Hundreds of Africans are arrested every day for violating the "Pass Laws". From 1956 to 1957 alone, more than 643,000 people were arrested for violating the "Pass Laws" and other minor crimes.

　　The South African magazine "Drum" once exposed the white government's despicable purpose of arresting Africans en masse under false pretenses. It pointed out that South Africa's "farmers hope to obtain labor without spending a penny, and providing such labor has indeed become the main purpose of the pass system. The implementation of this system has turned the police and government officials into cheap farm labor conscription teams."

　　"Drum" magazine said that there is factual evidence that South African government officials signed "contracts" with farmers on behalf of the arrested people, and then claimed that they had read the contents of the "contracts" to the relevant parties. In fact, the arrested person not only did not agree to the "contract", but the farmer was not even present.

　　"Drum" magazine went on to say that this "contract labor" system brings a large number of cheap, untrained, and unorganized laborers into the farming areas. In this case, the farmers simply do not want to make the situation tolerable. The term of the "contract" is often extended for several weeks due to the worker's illness and inability to work. They are held in camps surrounded by barbed wire and high walls. During the busy farming season, they often work under the whips of armed police.

　　The South African authorities also issue "passes" to women. "Drum" magazine pointed out that the fact that farms are now frequently using female labor seems to indicate that the "passes" issued to women may one day be used for the same purpose.

　　From the day the "Pass Laws" were enacted, the South African people expressed strong opposition. This year, the fighting spirit of the South African people has become even higher. On May 30, the African National Congress of South Africa held a national conference against the "Pass Laws" in Johannesburg. The meeting decided to refuse to buy potatoes produced by white farms using African slave labor from May 31 to June 21. This is the first time the South African people have used the weapon of economic boycott in their long struggle against the "Pass Laws". On June 26, the African National Congress launched a further boycott by the South African people of the products of enterprises controlled by the ruling National Party.

　　Although the struggle of the South African people has been brutally suppressed, they are making continuous progress. The South African Federal Government was forced to announce on June 16 that it would temporarily suspend the dark farm "contract labor" system. Luthuli, the exiled President of the African National Congress of South Africa, recently said when meeting with a reporter from the Cape Town "New Century Weekly": "We hope that the movement in 1959 will awaken the South African people so that they will declare: We don't want any more passes."

### 不能容忍套在颈上的奴隶枷锁  南非人民强烈反对“通行证法”

    不能容忍套在颈上的奴隶枷锁
    南非人民强烈反对“通行证法”
    新华社4日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非白人政府的“通行证法”是套在南非人民颈上的一根奴隶的枷锁。南非人民正在加紧斗争，要使1959年成为南非历史上反对“通行证法”斗争的最伟大的一年。
      “通行证法”是法西斯的马兰政府在十年前左右制定的实行种族歧视的重要法律。这个法律绝对不是为了便利非洲人“通行”，而是要使他们寸步难行。法律规定每一个年满十六岁的非洲人必须随身携带一大套证件，其中有“身份证”、“迁移证”、“寻职证”、纳税收据……。如果证件不齐，警察就要加以逮捕。每天有成百的非洲人因为违反“通行证法”被逮捕。仅在1956年到1957年，就有六十四万三千多人由于违反“通行证法”和其他细小的罪名被捕。
    南非“鼓声”月刊曾经揭露了白人政府借故大批逮捕非洲人的卑鄙目的。它指出，南非的“农场主希望不花一文地获得劳工，提供这样的劳动力确乎已经成为通行证制度的主要目的。这种制度的实施已经把警察和政府官员变成廉价的农场劳工的强募队”。
      “鼓声”月刊说，有事实证明，南非政府官员代表被捕的人和农场主签订了“合同”然后宣称他已经向有关方面宣读了“合同”的内容。实际上被捕的人不仅没有同意这个“合同”，而且农场主甚至都不在场。
    “鼓声”月刊接着说，这种“合同劳工”制度给农场地区输进大批廉价的、没有受过训练和没有组织的劳工。在这种情况下，农场主根本就不想使情况成为能够忍受的。“合同”期限常常由于工人生病不能工作而延长数星期之久。他们被关在铁丝网和高墙的营房里。在农忙时期常常是在武装宪兵的皮鞭下劳动。
    南非当局对妇女也颁发“通行证”，“鼓声”月刊指出，目前农场经常使用妇女劳工，这一事实似乎表明颁发给妇女的“通行证”有一天也可能用于同样的目的。
    从“通行证法”制定的那一天起，南非人民就表示了强烈的反对情绪。今年以来，南非人民的斗争情绪更加高涨。5月30日，南非非洲人国民大会在约翰内斯堡召开了全国反对“通行证法”会议。会议决定从5月31日到6月21日拒绝购买白人农场利用非洲人奴隶劳动生产的马铃薯。这是南非人民在反对
  “通行证法”的长期斗争中第一次使用了经济抵制的武器。6月26日，非洲人国民大会发动南非人民进一步抵制白人执政党国民党控制的企业的产品。
    南非人民的斗争虽然遭到了残暴的镇压，但是，他们是在不断取得进展。南非联邦政府已经在6月16日被迫宣布暂时停止实行黑暗的农场“合同劳工”制度。在流放中的南非非洲人国民大会主席卢图利最近在接见开普顿“新世纪周报”的记者时说：“我们盼望1959年的运动能够唤起南非人民使他们将宣称：我们再不要什么通行证了。”（附图片）
