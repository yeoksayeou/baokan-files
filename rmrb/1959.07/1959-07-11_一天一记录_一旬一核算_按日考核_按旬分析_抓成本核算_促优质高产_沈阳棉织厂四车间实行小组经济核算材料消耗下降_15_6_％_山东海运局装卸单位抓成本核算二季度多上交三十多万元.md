    Shenyang Cotton Weaving Factory's Fourth Workshop Implements Group Economic Accounting, Material Consumption Decreases by 15.6%

    (Our Newspaper) Shenyang News – In the Shenyang Cotton Weaving Factory's Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, they improved the economic accounting system. After the Fourth Workshop implemented the group economic accounting system in June, the output in the first half of the month increased by 3% compared to the average daily output in May, the product quality (first-class product rate off the machine) increased by 0.9% compared to May, material consumption decreased by 15.6% compared to May, and the cost decreased by 1.91% compared to May.

    The factory first conducted a pilot project of group economic accounting in the second group of Class C in the Fourth Workshop. In implementing group economic accounting, they determined five indicators as the content of group accounting: output, quality, waste cotton, machinery and materials, and wage attendance. The quality inspectors, statistical accountants, wage attendance clerks, and material clerks in the group were responsible for assessing economic indicators, improving daily management in conjunction with their respective duties, and providing information to the group leader and workshop managers through economic activity analysis, and actively helping workers achieve their targets from ideological and technical aspects. The accounting method was: daily assessment, decadal analysis. The calculation method was: based on the comparison between the planned targets and actual completion of the month, decade, and day, the figures for increase and decrease were calculated, and then the amount of increased production and savings or profit and loss were calculated and announced to the masses using accounting boards.

    After the implementation of group economic accounting, the economic accounting and increase production and practice economy thinking of cadres and workers have been significantly improved. Every day, the employees analyze economic activities through accounting boards and accounting sheets, solve problems immediately when they are discovered, and provide information to the group leader and workshop full-time managers in a timely manner, achieving one record per day and one accounting per decade. In the past, groups did not pay enough attention to saving when receiving materials. Now they cherish every drop of oil and every part, fearing that they will exceed the quota and affect the collective honor of the group. The second group of Class C saved more than 160 yuan worth of materials on the fifth day after implementing economic accounting in May.

    In the past, weaving workers did not pay much attention to minor machine faults; now, as soon as there is a minor fault, the weaving workers will repair it themselves or take the initiative to find a repair worker to fix it.

    The implementation of group economic accounting has further promoted the labor emulation campaign. One day in mid-May, when weaving worker Wang Wensheng was adding his completed daily output to the accounting board, he found that group leader Li Zixiang's daily output was 45.5 meters, half a meter more than his own, so he made up his mind to catch up. The next day, his output did catch up with Li Zixiang. The second group of Class C, which first implemented group economic accounting, has been leading the workshop in output and quality in May.

    (According to Qingdao Daily) In the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation Maritime Bureau's Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, they mobilized the masses to conscientiously implement economic accounting. In the second quarter, the cost of loading and unloading units decreased by 24.34% compared to the first quarter, and they turned over more than 353,000 yuan in profits to the state.

    At the beginning of this year, the bureau did not pay enough attention to saving and cost management, resulting in the cost of loading and unloading units in January increasing by 0.55% compared to December of last year. In response to these circumstances, the bureau's Party committee first organized leading cadres to conscientiously study the Party's instruction that economic work must be done more and more meticulously. On the basis of improving the ideological understanding of leading cadres, they comprehensively analyzed the factors that led to low loading and unloading efficiency and high costs in the entire bureau.

    Then, they further mobilized the masses to set a leap forward target of reducing the cost of loading and unloading units by 16.95% in the second quarter. In order to ensure a substantial reduction in costs, employees revised and established various economic accounting methods and planned management systems. For example, the mechanical team established a mechanical operation ticket system and promoted single-vehicle planning, so that every driver could understand his planned tasks and daily struggle goals, and strengthened the concept of planning. At the same time, they established a quota for fuel consumption and a system for the requisition of other materials, eliminating waste. Due to the improvement of various systems and strict control over the deployment of workers from other units, the Dagang loading and unloading area averaged only 21 workers deployed from other units per day in May, a decrease of 103 workers compared to the average of 124 workers per day in April. The expenditure on loading and unloading fees paid to outside units in May was more than 23,500 yuan less than in April, while the completed production tasks increased by 6% compared to April.

    The implementation of economic accounting has also promoted the in-depth development of the technical innovation movement. In less than five months, the bureau successfully trial-produced and improved more than 80 types of indigenous and foreign mechanical tools, which played a significant role in saving manpower and improving labor productivity.

    In order to comprehensively and deeply implement economic accounting, the bureau implemented cost accounting for single vehicles, single ships, and loading and unloading work teams in July, so that workers could grasp both production and cost conditions, and economic accounting and cost management were established on a solid mass basis.

    一天一记录　一旬一核算　按日考核　按旬分析
    抓成本核算　促优质高产
    沈阳棉织厂四车间实行小组经济核算材料消耗下降15.6％
    山东海运局装卸单位抓成本核算二季度多上交三十多万元
    本报讯　沈阳市棉织厂在增产节约运动中，健全了经济核算制。第四车间6月份实行小组经济核算制以后，上半月产品产量就比5月份平均日产量提高3％，产品质量（下机一等品率）比5月份提高0.9％，材料消耗比5月份降低15.6％，成本比5月份降低1.91％。
    这个厂首先在第四车间丙班第二组进行了小组经济核算的试点。他们在实行小组经济核算中，确定产量、质量、回丝、机物料和工资考勤等五个指标，作为小组核算内容。由小组里的质量检查员、统计核算员、工资考勤员、物料员分别负责考核经济指标，结合本职业务搞好日常管理，通过经济活动分析，及时给组长和车间管理人员提供资料，并积极主动地从思想、技术方面帮助工人实现指标。核算方法是：按日考核，按旬分析。计算方法是：依据月、旬、日的计划指标和实际完成情况的对比，计算出提高和降低的数字，然后再算出增产节约或盈亏金额，用核算板向群众公布。
    实行小组经济核算以后，干部和工人的经济核算和增产节约的思想显著提高了。职工们每天通过核算板、核算表进行经济活动分析，发现问题就立即解决，并且及时向组长和车间专职管理人员提供资料，做到一天一记录，一旬一核算。过去小组领取材料，注意节约不够。现在他们对一滴机油、一个零件都十分珍惜，唯恐超过定额指标，影响小组集体荣誉。丙班第二组5月份实行经济核算后的第五天，就节约了价值一百六十多元的材料。
    过去机器有点小毛病，织布工人不太重视；现在一有点毛病，织布工人就动手修理或主动地找修理工人把它修好。
    实行小组经济核算，进一步推动了劳动竞赛。5月中的一天，织布工人王文盛在核算板添写自己已完成的日产量时，发现组长李子祥日产量是四十五点五米比自己多产半米，便下定决心追赶。第二天他的产量，果然赶上了李子祥。首先实行小组经济核算的丙班第二组，5月份产量、质量一直在车间领先。
    据青岛日报消息　山东省交通厅海运局在增产节约运动中发动群众认真推行经济核算，第二季度装卸单位成本比第一季度降低24.34％，向国家多上缴了三十五万三千多元的利润。
    今年年初，这个局对节约、成本管理重视不够，以致1月份装卸单位成本比去年12月份提高0.55％。局党委针对这些情况，首先组织领导干部认真学习了党关于经济工作一定要愈作愈细致的指示。在提高领导干部思想认识的基础上，全面分析了全局装卸效率低、成本高的因素。
    接着，进一步发动群众订出第二季度装卸单位成本降低16.95％的跃进指标。职工们为保证大幅度地降低成本，修订和建立了各种经济核算办法及计划管理等制度。如机械队建立了机械作业票制度，推行单车计划，使每一司机都能了解自己的计划任务和每日的奋斗目标，加强了计划观念。同时，建立了燃料消耗定额及其他材料的领用制度，杜绝了浪费现象。大港装卸区由于健全了各种制度，严格控制调用外单位工人，5月份外调工人作业平均每天仅二十一人，较4月份平均每天一百二十四人减少了一百零三人，5月份较4月份少开支外付装卸费二万三千五百多元，而完成的生产任务却比4月份提高6％。
    实行经济核算，也推动了技术革新运动的深入开展。全局在不到五个月的时间内试制和改进成功了各种土洋机械工具八十余种，这对节省人力、提高劳动生产率起了重大作用。
    为了全面深入地贯彻经济核算，这个局7月份实行了单车单船和装卸工班成本核算，使工人既能掌握生产情况，又能掌握成本情况，使经济核算和成本管理建立在牢固的群众基础上。
