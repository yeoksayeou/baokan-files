More Pay for More Work, Increased Work Efficiency
Xingzi County's Reasonable Work Evaluation Boosts Mass Production Enthusiasm

According to the Jiangxi Daily, Xingzi County in Jiangxi Province, on the basis of dividing into specialized groups, implements quota-based contracting and conscientiously implements the principle of distribution according to work, greatly improving the "Double抢" (rush harvesting and planting) high-efficiency, high-quality competition.

Since the county launched the high-efficiency, high-quality "Double 抢" campaign, a large number of "Five-Good" cadres (good work, good style, good study, good at uniting with the masses, good at labor) and "Five-Good" commune members (good ideology, good production labor, good at obeying leadership and observing discipline, good at uniting and helping each other, good at cherishing public property) have emerged through regular evaluations. The labor enthusiasm of the broad masses is high. However, a few production teams still implemented work point recording based on a fixed amount, hindering the enthusiasm of some commune members to improve labor. After discovering this problem, the county party committee believed that in order to deeply develop the high-efficiency, high-quality competition movement, it should combine political command with material incentives. At present, it is necessary to prominently grasp the implementation of the principle of distribution according to work.

In order to correctly implement the principle of distribution according to work, boost the enthusiasm of commune members, and complete the "Double 抢" task quickly, well, and economically, the county party committee universally promoted the experience of the 40th team of the Qianhu Brigade of the Wenquan Commune throughout the county. The practice of the fourth team of the Qianhu Brigade is: (1) The labor force responsible for various procedures such as cutting rice, threshing, plowing, pulling seedlings, and transplanting rice, are organized into specialized groups according to production needs, technical expertise, and voluntary combination; within the specialized groups, implement group contracting and quota-based work point recording. The biggest advantage of this is that work points are recorded according to the quota completed by each person on the same day, which is convenient for breaking the method of simply recording work points based on "women at 70% and men at 100%," conscientiously implementing the principle of more pay for more work, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses; at the same time, it saves the procedures for scoring and recording work points during the busy farming season. (2) Starting from the characteristics of "Double 抢" that it has a short time frame, strong seasonality, and creates greater value, reasonably increase work points and appropriately increase rewards.

After the establishment of specialized groups and the implementation of quota-based contracting in various places, the county's "Double 抢" high-efficiency, high-quality competition was vigorously launched, showing a new atmosphere of "three highs" and "one early." "Three highs" means: (1) High work efficiency. Combining fixed specialized groups with the implementation of quota-based contracting makes it possible to pay more for more work, which is conducive to cultivating and developing the specialties of commune members and improving work efficiency. According to surveys in Xintang Brigade of Hengtang Commune, Qianhu Brigade of Wenquan Commune, and Xingxing Brigade of Aikou Commune: strong male laborers do an average of 1.6 labor days per person per day, and strong female laborers (with a base score of nine points) do an average of 1.2 labor days per person per day. The work efficiency of general male laborers and weak laborers has also been improved. (2) High attendance rate. Since more work can lead to more pay, and the organization is based on voluntary combination according to each person's specialty, this better encourages commune members to do more labor days and more work. For example, in Wenquan Commune, the labor attendance rate during the "Double 抢" reached 100%, an increase of 5% over the same period last year. (3) High quality. Various specialized groups such as cutting rice, threshing, transporting grain, drying grain, spreading fertilizer, plowing, pulling seedlings, and transplanting rice are connected to each other in the process, which facilitates mutual supervision and inspection. Guanyinqiao Commune has established a continuous acceptance quality system. The rice cutting group ensures that no ears of rice are lost; the threshing group ensures that the threshing is clean and there is no throwing or scattering; the tilling group ensures that the plowing is deep and the harrowing is thorough; the transplanting group ensures dense planting meets the specifications, and no blind seedlings are planted. "One early" is that harvesting starts early. This year's "Double 抢" started a week earlier than last year.

Beijing, July 23rd. The Pingnan County of Guangxi Province transferred a group of rural cadres to help production teams with slower summer harvests to improve labor arrangements.

Since the summer harvest began in early July, some production teams in Pingnan County with weaker leadership have not properly arranged and deployed labor, and each person harvested an average of one to one and a half fields of rice per day, resulting in very low work efficiency. Therefore, the Pingnan County Party Committee required all localities to mobilize the masses to speed up the harvesting progress. Many commune cadres and brigade party branch secretaries personally went to production teams with weak leadership to conduct pilot projects and reverse the slow situation. The efficiency of early rice harvesting throughout the county has increased by 50%.

    多劳多得  工效提高
    星子县合理评工群众生产劲头更高
    据江西日报消息　江西星子县在划分专业小组的基础上实行定额包工，认真贯彻按劳分配原则，把“双抢”高工效高质量竞赛大大提高了一步。
    这个县展开高工效高质量的“双抢”大竞赛以来，经过定期评比，涌现出大批“五好”干部（工作好、作风好、学习好、团结群众好、劳动好）和“五好”社员（思想好、生产劳动好、服从领导遵守纪律好、团结互助好、爱护公共财产好），广大群众劳动热情高涨。但是也有少数生产队仍是实行按底分记工，妨碍了部分社员提高劳动积极性。县委发现这一问题后，认为深入开展高工效高质量竞赛运动，应以政治挂帅与物质鼓励相结合。当前，必须突出地抓住贯彻按劳分配原则。
    为了正确执行按劳分配原则，鼓足社员干劲，多快好省地完成“双抢”任务，县委在全县普遍推广温泉公社钱湖大队第四十队的经验。钱湖大队四小队的做法是：（一）担任割禾、打谷、犁耙田、扯秧、插秧等各个工序的劳力，根据生产需要、技术特长、自愿结合，分别编成专业组；在专业组内部，实行小组包工、定额记工。这样做，最大的好处是，按各人当日完成的定额记工，便于破除单纯按“妇女老七分、男人老十分”记工的办法，认真贯彻了多劳多得的原则，调动了群众的积极性；同时，又节省了农忙时评分记工的手续。（二）从“双抢”时间短、季节性强、创造价值较大的特点出发，合理提高工分，适当增加奖励。
    各地在建立专业小组的基础上实行定额包工以后，全县“双抢”高工效高质量大竞赛蓬勃展开，出现“三高”、“一早”的新气象。“三高”即：（一）工效高。把固定专业组与实行定额包工结合起来，做到多劳多得，利于培养和发挥社员专长，提高工效。据横塘公社新塘大队、温泉公社钱湖大队、隘口公社星星大队等地调查：男强劳力每人每日平均做一点六个劳动日，女强劳力（底分九分）每人每日平均做一点二个劳动日。一般男劳力与弱劳力的工效也提高了。（二）出勤高。由于多劳可以多得，加以按照各人特长，自愿结合编组，这就更好地鼓励社员多作劳动日、多出活。如温泉公社“双抢”中劳力出勤率达百分之百，比去年同期提高5％。（三）质量高。割禾、打谷、运谷、晒谷、撒粪、犁耙田、扯秧、插秧等各个专业小组，在工序上互相衔接，便于彼此互相督促检查。观音桥公社建立了连环验收质量制度，割禾组做到不丢穗、不落粒；打谷组做到打得净、不抛撒；整田组做到耕得深、耙得糊；插秧组做到了密植合乎规格，不栽瞎眼秧。“一早”是收割动手早。今年“双抢”比去年提前一周。
    本报南宁23日电　广西平南县抽调一批农村干部，帮助夏收较慢的生产队搞好劳动力安排。
    7月初夏收开始以来，平南县有些领导力量较弱的生产队，没有妥善安排和调配劳动力，每人每日平均割禾一分到一分半田，工作效率很低。因此中共平南县委要求各地发动群众，加快抢收进度。很多公社干部和大队党支部书记，都亲自到领导力量薄弱的生产队搞试点，扭转缓慢局面。全县早稻收割效率提高50％。
