Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 5th: Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem delivered a speech on the evening of July 5th at a celebration held by the People's Resistance Forces to welcome the first anniversary of the July 14th Revolution. He reiterated his proposal to suspend political party activities and stated that he would encourage a national united front only after the transition period. Kassem said, "I have asked my brothers in all political parties to suspend their activities during the transition period so that I can achieve my goals." He professed, "I am not opposed to political parties. All political parties are my brothers."

Regarding the recently established new national united front, he said, "As for the national united front, I encourage this front, but only after the transition period."

Kassem also spoke about the recently announced amendment to the land reform law. He explained, "I amended this law for the benefit of the peasants."

According to the "People's Solidarity Newspaper," based on the decision recently issued by the Iraqi Supreme Committee for Land Reform to amend the land reform law regarding the adjustment of the proportion of crop distribution, peasants who originally could get 60% of the harvest on land irrigated by pumping machines according to the land reform law will now only receive 55%, while landlords will get 45% instead of 40%. This decision will apply nationwide.

Kassem also said: "In two days, we will announce new achievements that will enhance the prestige of the Republic."

Kassem also made a statement at a press conference this afternoon. He believes that militarily, "we are in complete control of the situation and are able to deal with it wisely and accurately. We can quickly crush any movement." He said, "There is no foreign interference in our affairs now." He believes that "Iraq has now completely and forever driven out imperialism." He also said, "Some say that feudalism and reactionaries are attacking the peasants. I say that there is no trace of feudalism now."

Kassem also addressed the issue of suspending political party activities at the reception. He said: "I have frozen the activities of the Iraqi Kurdistan Unified Democratic Party and the National Democratic Party."

    卡塞姆重申要停止政党活动
    表示要到过渡时期后才鼓励民族统一阵线
    新华社巴格达5日电　伊拉克总理卡塞姆5日晚上在人民抵抗部队为迎接7月14日革命一周年而举行的庆祝会上发表了演说。他重申停止政党活动的主张并表示要在过渡时期以后才鼓励民族统一阵线。卡塞姆说：“我已经要求各政党的兄弟们在过渡时期停止活动，以便使我能够实现我的目标”。他表白说，“我并不反对政党。所有的政党都是我的兄弟”。
    对于最近成立的新的民族统一阵线，他说，“至于民族统一阵线，我鼓励这个阵线，但是要在过渡时期以后。”
    卡塞姆还谈到最近宣布的修正土地改革法。他解释说，“我是为了农民的利益而修正这项法律的”。
    据“人民团结报”指出，根据伊拉克土地改革最高委员会最近发布的修改土地改革法中关于修改农作物分配比例的决定，原来按照土地改革法，农民在用抽水机灌溉的土地上本来可得收获量的60％，现在只能拿到55％，而地主将得到45％而不是40％。这一决定将在全国适用。
    卡强姆还说：“两天以后，我们将宣布会提高共和国威信的新成就。”
    卡塞姆今天下午在记者招待会上也发表了谈话。他认为，在军事上“我们完全控制着局势并且能够明智而准确地应付局势。我们能够迅速粉碎任何运动”。他说，“现在没有任何外国在干涉我国的事务”。他认为，“伊拉克现在已经彻底和永远赶走了帝国主义”。他还说，“有人说，封建主义和反动派正向农民进攻，我说，现在已经没有封建主义的踪迹了”。
    卡塞姆在招待会上也谈到了停止政党活动的问题。他说：“我已经冻结了伊拉克库尔德斯坦统一民主党和国家民主党的活动。”
