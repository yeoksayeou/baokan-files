    Thirteen Years in the Kitchen

    Communist Party member Wu Kun has been working as a cook for most of the time since he joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army in May 1946. For thirteen years, whether in the past war years or in today's peaceful times, he has always tried his best to make the food fragrant and delicious, so that everyone is willing to eat it. He has a saying: "As long as everyone smiles when they see the food and can eat their fill and have the energy to fight and work, Old Wu will be satisfied."

    Wu Kun was born in Northeast China, his family was very poor, and he lost his parents when he was young, living a lonely life. He joined the People's Liberation Army at the age of twenty-five, working as a transport worker, cook, and breeding squad leader in a hospital, and later as a cook squad leader. When he was the breeding squad leader, it was during the war, and he often marched and transferred. In order to let everyone rest well, he found grass to make beds for everyone as soon as he arrived at the camp, and got up in the middle of the night to feed the livestock. Soon, he was promoted to acting platoon leader, and he still took the lead in everything, often returning to the kitchen to help with work. Someone laughed at him: "Why don't you be a platoon leader and go to wash pots!" He said: "People are iron, food is steel, and getting food right is a big deal!" Later, he returned to the cooking squad. He got up early and worked late, often starting the fire and boiling water before waking everyone up. Under his leadership, the whole class became motivated and the food was improved.

    Later, he worked in a sanatorium for a long time. He cared about the patients' diet as much as the doctors cared about the patients' condition, often soliciting opinions in the wards and understanding the patients' tastes. He often took time to deliver food to the patients, watching their expressions when they ate. If a patient ate less, he would be worried, either persuading them to eat more or asking if the food was too salty or bland. Once, a few patients wanted to eat sweet potatoes, but the kitchen didn't have any, so he took advantage of his lunch break to buy more than ten kilograms from residents' homes, cooked them according to the patients' tastes, and sent them over. Another time, a patient in the tuberculosis department had a poor appetite and wanted to eat fish, but he couldn't buy it for a while. When he found out, he didn't even eat lunch and ran to the river to catch fish. When the patient woke up from his nap, he brought him a stewed fresh fish, and the patient happily ate a big meal. Another time, a patient was seriously ill and didn't want to eat. He went over twice and offered more than a dozen kinds of food, but the patient just shook his head. He suddenly remembered the patient's usual taste and said, "How about stewed radish?" The patient was interested in eating after hearing him say that. So he went around looking for radish, stewed it, and sent it to the patient.

    Originally, it was easy to waste food when making meals for patients, but he tried his best to save it. In addition to adhering to the vegetable ordering and reservation system, when figuring out the patients' tastes, he always asked what they wanted to eat and how much they wanted to eat, and then made it accurately. Usually, even a handful of chicken feathers or a bone, he paid attention to collecting them for centralized sales. He often said to the comrades in the class: "If we don't take care of the comrades who are injured and sick for the revolution, who will!"

    炊事房里十三年
    共产党员吴坤，从1946年5月参加中国人民解放军到现在，绝大部分时间做炊事工作。十三年来，他不论在过去的战争年代还是今天的和平时期，总是想尽办法把饭菜做得清香可口，人人愿吃。他有句口头语：“只要大家见到饭菜笑呵呵，能够吃饱喝足，有劲打仗和工作，我老吴就心满意足了。”
    吴坤出生在东北，家贫如洗，年青时失去双亲，过着孤苦伶仃的生活。他二十五岁那年参加解放军，在一个医院里当过运输员、炊事员、饲养班长，以后一直当炊事班长。他在当饲养班长时，正是战争环境，经常行军转移，为了让大家休息好，一到宿营地他就给大家找铺草搭床铺，三更半夜起来喂牲口。不久，他升任了代理排长，依然凡事带头，时常回到炊事房帮助干活。有人笑他：“放着排长不干，去刷锅，何必！”他说：“人是铁，饭是钢，搞伙食可是大事！”后来他又回到了炊事班。他起早贪晚，常常早晨生好火，烧好水才叫醒大家。全班在他带动下，干劲起来了，伙食也搞好了。
    以后，他长期在休养所工作。他关心病人的饮食像医生关心病人的病情一样，经常到病房征求意见，了解病人的口味。他经常抽空把饭送到病人身边，看病人吃饭时的神态，那个病人吃少了，他就放不下心，不是劝说就是问咸问淡。有一次几个病人想吃地瓜，伙房没有，他利用中午休息时间到居民家里买来十多斤，按病人口味做好送去了。还有一次，结核科有个病人食欲不佳，想吃鱼，一时又买不到，他知道以后连午饭也没吃，跑到河里去捉。当病人午睡醒来时，他端着炖好的鲜鱼来了，病人高兴地大吃一顿。还有一次，有个病人病重，不想吃饭，他过去两次，说了十多样饭菜，病人只是摇头，他忽然想起病人平日对他讲的口味说：“炖萝卜好吗？”病人被他一说有了吃饭的兴趣。于是他又去东找西找，找来萝卜，炖好送给病人。
    本来做病号饭容易浪费，可是他想尽办法来节约。他除了坚持点菜预约制度以外，在摸病人口味时，总是问一问吃什么，吃多少，问准再做。平时那怕是一撮鸡毛，一根骨头，他都很注意收集，以便集中出售。他常对班里的同志说：“干革命嘛，咱们不爱护为革命负伤、生病的同志谁爱护！”
