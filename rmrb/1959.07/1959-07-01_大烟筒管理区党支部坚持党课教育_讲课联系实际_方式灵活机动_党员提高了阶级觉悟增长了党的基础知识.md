The Dayantong Management District Party Branch Persists in Party Class Education
Lectures are Linked to Reality, and Methods are Flexible and Mobile
Party Members Have Improved Class Consciousness and Increased Basic Knowledge of the Party

(Reported by this newspaper) The Dayantong Management District Branch of the Lishu Town People's Commune in Lishu County, Jilin Province, pays close attention to linking with reality in adhering to Party class education; in educational methods, it pays attention to being flexible and mobile. Therefore, it effectively improved the awareness of Party members and enhanced the Party's combat effectiveness.

This branch has a total of twenty Party members. After the Party rectification last winter and this spring, the Party members' awareness has been improved, and they can generally complete the tasks assigned by the Party on time. However, some Party members are not clear enough about the basic knowledge of the Party and how to be a Communist Party member, and they know very little about the Party's policies in rural areas. Individual Party members do not play a significant role among the masses. Therefore, the combat effectiveness of the branch cannot be further brought into play. In view of the above situation, the branch committee made a special study and unanimously believed that only by strengthening the political and ideological education of Party members can the awareness of Party members be effectively improved, so that the branch can play a core fortress role. Adhering to Party class education is one of the effective methods to strengthen political and ideological education. Therefore, the branch committee finally decided to adhere to Party class education and specifically discussed the methods, plans, and systems of Party class education. After this period of exploration, this branch has initially gained some more effective experiences.

When lecturing, they pay close attention to linking with reality. For example, when talking about "The Great Tasks of the Communist Party of China," they link it with the mentality of Party members in the branch who are satisfied with the status quo and lack the courage to overcome difficulties. When talking about "The Basic Tasks of the Party's Rural Branches in the Communes," they link it with the management district's 1959 plan and how to realize this plan, and how Party members can lead the masses to realize the 1959 plan. When talking about how to be a good Party member, pay attention to using the deeds of good Party members to educate all Party members. The branch summarized the advanced deeds of Party member Wang Yonggui, who was selfless, loved the community like his home, sacrificed himself for the collective, and took the lead in labor, and explained that Wang Yonggui had a high level of communist consciousness and was a model for all Party members. All Party members used Wang Yonggui's deeds to compare and examine themselves. This kind of lecture, which is linked to reality, not only makes it easier for Party members to accept but also solves problems in Party members' thinking and work, which is very effective. Party member Sun Jiaocai, who originally had a complacent mentality, said: "The production of our team is better than other teams, and I always thought it was almost good enough in the past. Now I know that our task is far from complete, and I will definitely work harder in the future." Party member Wang Junsheng, who was not proactive enough in his work, now gets up early and comes back late every day, taking the initiative to find work to do.

In lecturing, in addition to paying attention to linking with reality, attention is also paid to being easy to understand. Most Party members have a low level of political theory and culture. To make Party members understand the truth of the lesson, it is best to explain it in the language of the peasants. Some nouns are generally not explained, or even if they are, they are explained in a simple way. For example, "productive forces," "relations of production," and "means of production" are all explained in a simple way. Listening to it this way, it does not feel pretentious. In order to be easy to understand, it is also possible to use simple analogies, and the analogies are vivid, convincing, and therefore help Party members understand the subject matter.

Of course, the so-called linking with reality and being easy to understand does not mean leaving the textbook and specifically talking about a lot of practical problems, but rather going to link with reality on the basis of understanding the essence of the text. In addition, special education is also carried out in connection with the central tasks of the Party in various periods so that the Party's policies in various periods can be implemented into the masses in a timely manner and turned into practical actions of the masses. For example, talk about spring plowing requirements during spring plowing and summer hoeing requirements during summer hoeing. The spirit of the instructions from higher levels is conveyed to the Party members and the masses in a timely manner.

In the past, one of the main reasons why the Party class system of this branch could not be adhered to regularly was that the lecture form was rigid. If a day was set for the lecture and it was delayed, it would not be given. To give a lecture, it was necessary to gather in one hall. This is not in line with the characteristics of rural areas, which are busy all year round. This time, the method of "concentrated lectures during slack farming seasons, scattered lectures during busy farming seasons, uninterrupted lectures during both slack and busy seasons, and regularizing the system" was adopted.

This method is flexible and mobile. During slack farming seasons, we gather together to attend Party classes. During busy farming seasons, we give scattered lectures. The fields and production teams are all classrooms. As long as there is some time, we can give lectures. Each team has six or seven Party members and activists who listen to lectures while resting in the fields. The time can be long or short. The teachers who give scattered lectures are often the branch committee members who are in charge of leading production. They are responsible for leading production and also for giving lectures. Because they have a relatively clear understanding of the production situation, they speak more realistically, and the Party members understand more deeply.

This branch has adopted the above methods to adhere to Party class education, which has greatly improved the awareness of Party members and created a situation in which everyone takes the lead and strives to be the first within the Party. Party members are energetic and highly motivated in production labor, making the branch a true battle fortress in the management district.

    大烟筒管理区党支部坚持党课教育
    讲课联系实际　方式灵活机动
    党员提高了阶级觉悟增长了党的基础知识
    本报讯　中共吉林省梨树县梨树镇人民公社大烟筒管理区支部，在坚持党课教育中，密切注意联系实际；在教育方式上，注意机动灵活。因而有效地提高了党员觉悟，增强了党的战斗力。
    这个支部共有党员二十名，经过去冬今春整党以后，党员觉悟有了提高，一般都能按时完成党交给的任务。但有些党员对于党的基本知识、怎样做一个共产党员还不够清楚，对党在农村的方针、政策了解很少，个别党员在群众中起的作用不大。因此，支部的战斗力不能更进一步地发挥。针对以上情况，支委会专门作了研究，一致认为只有加强对党员的政治思想教育，才能有效地提高党员觉悟，使支部起到核心堡垒作用。而坚持党课教育正是加强政治思想教育的有效方法之一。因此支委会最后决定：要坚持党课教育，并具体地讨论了党课教育的方法、计划、制度。经过这一时期的摸索，这个支部初步获得了一些较有成效的经验。
    在讲课时，他们很注意密切联系实际。如讲“中国共产党伟大的任务”时，就联系本支部党员满足现状、缺乏克服困难的勇气等思想进行讲授。在讲“党的农村支部在公社中的基本任务”时，就联系到管理区1959年规划，和怎样实现这个规划，党员如何领导群众实现1959年规划。在讲怎样做一个好党员时，注意运用好党员的事迹教育全体党员。支部总结了党员王永贵大公无私，爱社如家，克己为群，带头劳动的先进事迹，并说明了王永贵有较高的共产主义觉悟，是全体党员的榜样。全体党员都用王永贵的事迹对照检查自己。这样联系实际讲课，既使党员易于接受，又能解决党员思想和工作上的问题，收效很大。原来有自满思想的党员孙教才说：我们队的生产比别队搞得好点，过去我总认为差不多了。现在才知道我们的任务还远远没有完成，今后我一定加劲干。原来工作不够主动的党员王俊生，现在天天起早带晚，主动找活做。
    在讲课中，除注意联系实际外，还注意通俗易懂。大多数党员政治理论和文化水平不高，要使党员明白课文道理，最好用农民的语言来进行讲解。对一些名词一般的不讲，即或讲也作通俗的解释，如“生产力”“生产关系”“生产资料”等，都作通俗的解释。这样听起来，也不感到文里文气。为了做到通俗易懂，还可以打通俗比方，而且比方打的有声有色，有说服力，因此更帮助了党员领会课题。
    当然，所谓联系实际，通俗易懂，并不是离开课本专门去讲一大堆实际问题，而是在弄通课文精神实质的基础上再去联系实际。另外，对各时期党的中心任务也结合进行专题教育，使党的各时期的方针政策能及时贯彻到群众中去，把它变成群众的实际行动。如春耕时讲春耕要求，夏锄时讲夏锄要求。把上级的指示精神，都及时传达到党员群众中去。
    过去这个支部党课制度不能经常坚持的主要原因之一是讲课形式死板，定那一天讲，耽误了就不讲了，要讲课必须集中一堂。这和农村一年四季多忙的特点不相适应。这次采取了“农闲集中讲，农忙分散讲，闲忙不间断，制度经常化”的办法。
    这个办法机动灵活，农闲时就集中起来上党课，农忙时就分散讲，田间、生产队都是课堂，只要有点时间就可以讲，每队的党员和积极分子六、七人，在田头休息时，边休息边听课。时间可长可短。分散讲课的教员，往往都是分工领导生产的支部委员，他们既包领导生产，也包讲课。由于他们对生产情况了解得比较清楚，所以讲得更加切合实际，党员领会得也深。
    这个支部采取以上办法，坚持党课教育，大大提高了党员觉悟，在党内形成一个人人带头、个个争先的局面。党员在生产劳动中生龙活虎，干劲极大，使支部真正成了管理区的战斗堡垒。
