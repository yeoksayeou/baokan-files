    Joyful Zha Xi Xiu Long
    Beautiful and vast grassland!
    Flowers exude fragrance.
    The thrush flies down,
    Singing for the happy herdsmen.
        —Tibetan Folk Song
    Along the Ma Ya mountain range on the side of the Wuqiaoling peak, there is a wide strip of grassland, which the Tibetan people call "Zha Xi Xiu Long". Surrounded by mountains, with emerald green grass like a blanket, the clear and mirror-like Jinqiang River flows gently beside it. For generations, the Tibetan people have grazed here. Now they have long bid farewell to the dark and bitter days, and are happily living on the broad road of socialism.
    This place belongs to Yongfeng People's Commune of Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County. The Honggeta Pastoral Production Team, which was commended by the State Council during the Great Leap Forward last year, is located on this grassland. When I arrived here, the first thing that caught my eye was a row of snow-white brick houses standing on the banks of the Jinqiang River. These were the newly built power plant, milk powder factory, and noodle factory on the grassland... During the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the first power plant using Jinqiang River water was built, bringing light to the grassland.
    In the newly built residential area, there are now also a hospital, Tibetan school, kindergarten, nursing home, canteen, shop, feed processing plant, and wind and rain shelters for livestock. The residential area of the Honggeta Pastoral Team consists of two long rows of neatly arranged black tents on the thick, velvety grass on the banks of the Jinqiang River. Comrades from the pastoral team told me that this is only temporary. The commune has allocated tens of thousands of yuan this year and will start construction this summer on three hundred permanent brick houses, including residences, a club, a theater, a library, a department store... By autumn, the herdsmen will all move from the tents to live in this new grassland city.
    In the evening, we sat in the bright tent, and Captain Li Caihua Jia and other comrades from the team introduced the changes on the grassland. He said: Originally, this place was called "Heigeta". The entire grassland and a large number of cattle and sheep were occupied by the big herd owner Mo Kezuwa. Various diseases were prevalent on the grassland, and the poor herdsmen were mired in extreme hunger and hardship. They lived in dilapidated tents, not sheltering from wind and snow in winter, nor avoiding the heat in summer. They used broken wooden bowls and could only fill their hunger with wild vegetables and fried noodles, and they also had to pay tribute and alms to the herd owners and temples. In this way, the grassland was destroyed day by day, production shrank, and a large number of livestock died. In 1949, just after liberation, there were only one thousand two hundred and twenty-one head of livestock. After liberation, the Party led the herdsmen to carry out democratic reforms, thoroughly overthrowing the feudal exploitation system that had bound the productive forces of the pastoral areas and weighed on the herdsmen's heads for thousands of years; led the herdsmen to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, develop production, and gradually overcome poverty. By October of last year, the people's commune was realized on the grassland. In this year, the herdsmen's enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, and they set off a surge in grassland construction with soaring vigor. They built canals and eliminated poisonous weeds on the grassland, making 200,000 mu of grassland achieve nine "nos": no stones, no mounds, no miscellaneous bones, no poisonous weeds, no shrubs, no blind gophers, no parasites, no manure piles, no hala; and according to the law of summer grazing in the mountains and winter grazing in the valleys, the grassland was divided into large sections and designated into small areas, the livestock herds were reorganized, and zoned rotational grazing was implemented to ensure that livestock could eat good grass all year round, and that the grazed pasture could recover and regenerate. After such efforts, great achievements were made in livestock breeding and maintenance: in 1957, the pastoral team had a total of 8,730 head of livestock, which increased sharply to 10,864 head in 1958, with a net increase rate of 24.2%. The average number of livestock per person increased from 30 head in 1957 to 39 head, an increase of eight times compared to 1949 just after liberation.
    Due to the great development of production, the lives of the herdsmen have greatly improved. In 1958, the total income of the pastoral team was 67,733.53 yuan, with an average income of 1,041.42 yuan per household and 550.66 yuan per labor force. Now, you can see new quilts and leather clothes in any home you enter. In the old society, many poor herdsmen who were inadequately clothed not only wore new and warm leather clothes, but also inlaid their favorite colors of woolen cloth on the edges of the leather clothes according to Tibetan customs. Almost every herdsman has purchased a top hat, woolen socks, and felt boots. In terms of eating, all the poor herdsmen can now eat white flour and rice, and can drink brick tea; more than 60 children aged one to six in the team also have four to six ounces of milk every day, and 25 elderly people over 60 years old have milk tea, buttered tsampa, stewed vegetables, and white steamed buns every day.
    In order to build the grassland even more beautifully, the Tibetan people are currently engaged in an even greater production leap forward. Niu Zha Xi, a 51-year-old herdsman, grazes 108 wethers, each of which is like a small tiger. He excitedly told me: Even in the current spring fatigue period, his wethers, the largest of which already exceed 200 jin. He is cultivating flocks of sheep each weighing 300 jin. In the past, during the spring fatigue period, the sheep could not eat good grass and generally would not exceed 50 jin. Niu Zha Xi started herding sheep at the age of eight. Now he can tell from the expression and calls of each sheep whether the sheep's mood is happy, uncomfortable, or in need of something. Today, he is using his decades of herding experience to engage in feeding competitions with other herdsmen on the grassland. We also saw the third-generation improved breed of merino sheep raised by He Hua Gong Cailang. Its wool is dense and soft. The second generation of this type of sheep can produce about 12 jin of wool, the third generation produces about 18 jin, and the fourth generation produces about 25 jin, while ordinary local sheep generally produce 2 to 4 jin of wool. This is a great revolution for Zha Xi Xiu Long grassland. He Hua Gong Cailang said: Before long, the grassland will be fully realized with improved varieties of merino sheep. It is currently the season for spring lamb production, and the herdsmen are carrying felt bags in preparation for lambing at any time. Herdsman Jin Jiuyi said with confidence that none of the 238 ewes he was grazing were not pregnant, and he is striving to achieve a 100% lamb survival rate. This year, the Honggeta Pastoral Production Team has put forward very ambitious production targets for itself: to produce 3,959 young animals throughout the year, with a survival rate of over 98%, to increase the net increase rate of livestock from 24.2% last year to 35%, and to reach 14,406 head of various types of livestock by the end of the year, with an average of 51.7 head of livestock per person, an increase of 12 head compared to 1958. At present, all the herdsmen are working hard to achieve this goal.

    欢乐的抓喜秀龙
    美丽宽广的草原啊！
    花儿散发着芳香。
    画眉鸟飞了下来，
    为幸福的牧人歌唱。
        ——藏族民歌
    在乌鞘岭顶侧沿着马牙山麓，有一条宽广的带形草原，藏族人民称呼它“抓喜秀龙”。这里群山环抱，碧草如茵，澄澈如镜的金强河水，从它底身旁潺潺流过。许多世代以来，藏族人民就在这里放牧。如今他们早已辞别了黑暗辛酸的日子，在社会主义的康庄大道上欢乐地生活着。
    这个地方，属于天祝藏族自治县永丰人民公社，去年大跃进中得到国务院嘉奖的红圪塔牧业生产队就在这个草原上。当我来到这里，首先映入眼帘的是矗立在金强河畔的一排排粉刷得雪白的砖房，这是草原上新建的发电厂、奶粉厂、油面厂……。在大跃进的1958年里，利用金强河水发电的第一个电厂，给草原送来了光明。
    在新建的居民点里，现在还有医院、藏文学校、幼儿园、敬老院、食堂、商店、饲料加工厂，并且给牲口修建了避风遮雨的圈棚等。红圪塔牧业队的居民点在金强河畔厚绒绒的草地上，由两长列架设得很整齐的黑色帐篷组成，牧业队的同志对我说：这不过是临时性的。公社今年已拨出好几万元，将要在夏天开工兴建三百间永久性的砖房，其中包括住宅、俱乐部、剧院、图书馆、百货商店……。到秋后，牧民们就将全部从帐篷迁入这个新的草原城市居住。
    晚间，我们坐在明亮的帐篷里，由队长李才华嘉和队上其他同志，介绍草原的变迁。他说：原来，这个地方叫“黑圪塔”。整个草原和大批牛羊，都霸占在大牧主莫科族哇的手里。草原上流行着各种疾病，贫苦牧民们沉陷在极端饥寒困苦中。他们住着破烂的帐篷，冬不蔽风雪，夏不避炎热。他们用的是烂木碗，只能以野菜和炒面来充饥，还要给牧主和寺院纳供、斋布。就这样，过去的草原一天天被破坏，生产萎缩，牲口大批死亡。1949年刚解放时，才只有一千二百二十一头牲口。解放后，党领导牧民进行了民主改革，彻底推翻了几千年来束缚牧区生产力和压在牧民头上的封建剥削制度；领导牧民走互助合作化的道路，发展生产，逐步战胜了贫困。到去年10月，草原上又实现了人民公社化。这一年，牧民们生产积极性空前高涨，他们以冲天干劲掀起了建设草原的热潮，在草原上兴修水渠、铲除毒草，使二十万亩草原达到九无：无石头、无土堆、无杂骨、无毒草、无灌木、无瞎老、无寄生虫、无粪堆、无哈拉；并且依据夏放高山、冬放河谷的规律，把草原划大段、定小区，整编畜群，实行分区轮牧，保证牲畜终年吃到好草，和吃过的牧草能恢复再生。经过这样努力，在牲畜的繁殖和保养上获得了巨大的成绩：牧业队在1957年共有牲畜八千七百三十头，1958年激增至一万零八百六十四头，净增殖率24.2％，每人平均占有牲畜由1957年的三十头，净增加到三十九头，比刚解放的1949年，牲畜数目增加了八倍。
    由于生产上的大发展，牧民们的生活有了很大改善。1958年牧业队总收入六万七千七百三十三元五角三分，平均每户收入一千零四十一元四角二分，每一劳动力收入五百五十元六角六分。现在，你随便走进哪一家，都可以看到新的被子、皮衣，在旧社会里许多衣不蔽体的贫苦牧民，现在不仅穿上了又新又暖的皮衣，而且按照藏族习惯在皮衣边角上镶上了他们心爱的各种颜色的呢子，差不多每个牧民都购置了大礼帽、毛袜、毡靴。再以吃的来说，所有的贫苦牧民，现在都可以吃到白面、大米，都可以喝上砖茶；全队六十多个一至六岁的幼儿，每天还有四至六两牛奶，二十五名六十岁以上的老人，每天都有奶茶、酥油糌粑、烩菜、白馒吃。
    为了把草原建设得更加美丽，目前藏族人民投入了一个更大的生产跃进浪潮。五十一岁的老牧人牛抓喜，牧放着一百零八只羯羊，个个如小老虎一样。他兴奋地对我说：即使在目前春乏关头，他的羯羊，最大的已超过二百斤了。他正在培养每个三百斤的羊群。在过去春乏关头，羊吃不到好草，一般是不会超过五十斤的。牛抓喜八岁开始牧羊，现在他能从每一只羊的表情和叫声里，知道羊的情绪是欢乐、是不舒服、还是需要什么。如今，他正以几十年的牧羊经验，在草原上和其他牧羊人展开饲养竞赛。我们又看了贺华功才郎的第三代改良种绵羊，它的毛稠密细软，这种羊第二代的能产毛十二斤左右，三代的产十八斤左右，四代的产二十五斤左右，而普通的土种羊一般产毛二至四斤，这对于抓喜秀龙草原来说，正是一场大革命呢。贺华功才郎说：不要很久，草原上就将全部实现绵羊良种化了。目前正是春羔生产的季节，牧人们都带着准备随时接羔的毡包。牧人金九义满怀信心地说，他放的二百三十八只母羊，一个也没有空怀，他正在为争取羔羊成活率达到100％而奋斗。今年，红圪塔牧业生产队给自己提出了十分豪迈的生产指标：全年产仔畜三千九百五十九头，成活98％以上，要把牲畜净增殖率由去年的24.2％提高到35％，赶年底各类牲畜要达到一万四千四百零六头，平均每人有牲畜五十一点七头，比1958年增加十二头。现在，全体牧民正为实现这一指标而努力着。
