Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Since the Jingxi, Huainan, Fushun, Fuxin, and Kailuan five mining bureaus launched an initiative to the nation's coal mines to resolutely overfulfill the third-quarter production tasks, as of the 15th of this month, twenty-eight mining bureaus nationwide have responded with their conditions for accepting the challenge. These twenty-eight mining bureaus are: Jiaozuo, Hebi, Liaoyuan, Xuzhou, Jingxing, Shuangyashan, Benxi, Fengfeng, Datong, Yangquan, Fenxi, Xishan, Xuangang, Lu'an, Pingdingshan, Jiaohe, Beipiao, Jixi, Tongchuan, Pingxiang, Zibo, Zaozhuang, Hegang, Xinglong, Shizuishan, Guanyintang, Xinmi, and Xiahuayuan. In their challenge letters, these mining bureaus all expressed their determination to resolutely and comprehensively fulfill the third-quarter production tasks, put forward various advanced indicators for completing the tasks, and proposed specific measures to guarantee the realization of these indicators.
    Currently, the morale of the workers in each mining bureau is unprecedentedly high. Competition between mines, teams, and shifts has gradually unfolded. Coal production is steadily rising, tunneling footage is gradually increasing, and labor productivity has also greatly increased. The Fengfeng Mining Bureau has continuously achieved high production since the 14th, with daily output soaring by more than 3,000 tons compared to the 13th, and tunneling also increased by more than 150 meters compared to the 13th. From the 1st to the 15th, the average daily output level of each mine in the Jingxi Mining Bureau increased by 6% to 15% compared to the beginning of the month. The Pingxiang Mining Bureau's daily output from the 1st to the 15th also increased by more than 1,000 tons compared to the beginning of the month. The Huainan Mining Bureau's output level on the 14th increased by more than 2,500 tons compared to the average daily output level in the first ten days of the month. The Kailuan General Management Office's output on the 15th exceeded the average daily plan for July by more than 2,000 tons, and the average daily tunneling footage from the 12th to the 15th increased by 30.6% compared to the first ten days of the month. The Datong Mining Bureau's daily output has increased by more than 7% since the 10th compared to the beginning of the month, and tunneling has increased by 6%.
    As of the 15th, the coal production of 140 bureaus and mines nationwide and 42 key bureaus and mines is steadily rising. According to incomplete statistics, the average daily output of 140 bureaus and mines increased by 9.7% compared to the beginning of the month, the average daily output of 42 key bureaus and mines increased by 8.9% compared to the beginning of the month, and the total tunneling footage increased by 6.3% compared to the beginning of the month.
    Currently, all bureaus and mines across the country are comprehensively carrying out competition, deeply resolving specific problems, summarizing and exchanging experiences, and pushing the large-scale bumper harvest red flag competition movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy to a new climax.
