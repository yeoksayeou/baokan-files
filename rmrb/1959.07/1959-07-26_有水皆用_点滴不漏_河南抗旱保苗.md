Henan is fighting drought to protect seedlings.

(Our newspaper's dispatch from Zhengzhou on the 25th) People in various parts of Henan Province have taken up arms and are fully engaged in the movement to fight drought and protect seedlings, ensuring a bumper autumn harvest.

Since entering July, rainfall in Henan Province has been very low. It is now the hottest period of summer, with high temperatures and high evaporation, increasing the water demand of crops, but the soil moisture content has dropped sharply. The soil moisture content of most autumn fields is only about 12% to 15%, so a drought is widespread throughout the province, and several thousand acres of autumn crops are already threatened by drought.

In order to overcome the drought, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee jointly issued an "Emergency Instruction on Launching a Drought Resistance and Seedling Protection Campaign to Ensure a Bumper Autumn Harvest" on the 18th. On the evening of the 19th, the Provincial Party Committee also held an emergency telephone conference for the first secretaries of the regional and municipal party committees. Yang Weiping, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, requested at the meeting that all localities overcome any paralysis and wait-for-rain mentality, and that the entire party and all the people should immediately mobilize, with the first secretary personally taking command, concentrating their efforts to overcome the drought.

Currently, a massive drought resistance and seedling protection campaign is in full swing throughout the province. All five large-scale Yellow River irrigation canals in Xinxiang Prefecture have been opened to release water, and inland river canals, well springs, reservoirs, and various water lifting tools have also been put into the struggle to resist drought and protect seedlings. In the last four days alone, 1.2 million mu of autumn fields with severe drought symptoms have been watered. Yiyang County in Luoyang Prefecture put forward the slogan "Bring the ditch water up, lift the well water up, dig out the groundwater, draw out the pond and cellar water, every drop of water is a grain of grain, use all water available, not wasting a drop." More than 50,000 drought-fighting troops fought day and night in the fields, working hard for two days, irrigating and spot-watering 31,200 mu of autumn fields, and building eight canals and digging 170 wells. Guangchuan County in Xinyang Prefecture, while fighting the drought, also built 86 river dams, dug wells and canals, which can expand the irrigated area by more than 9,300 mu. The Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently transferred more than 650 cadres from the directly subordinate agencies, led by three secretaries, four members of the Prefectural Committee, and more than 30 cadres above the level of directors and bureau chiefs, to form 15 working groups to go to the front line of drought resistance.

    有水皆用  点滴不漏
    河南抗旱保苗
    本报郑州25日电　河南省各地人民挥戈上阵，全力投入抗旱保苗运动，确保秋季农业大丰收。
    进入7月以来，河南全省降雨量很少。时届伏期，气温高，蒸发大，作物需水量增加，土壤含水量却急剧下降。大部分秋田土壤含水量只在12％到15％左右，因而全省普遍呈现旱象，有几千亩秋作物已经受到干旱威胁。
    为了战胜干旱，中共河南省委和省人民委员会于18日联合发出了“关于开展抗旱保苗运动，保证秋季大丰收的紧急指示”。19日晚，省委又召开了地、市委第一书记紧急电话会议。省委书记处书记杨蔚屏在会上要求各地克服任何麻痹等雨思想，全党全民立即动员起来，第一书记亲自挂帅，集中力量战胜干旱。
    目前，一个千军万马的抗旱保苗运动，正在全省范围内如火如荼地展开。新乡专区五个大型引黄灌溉渠道全部开闸放水，内河渠道井泉水库和各种提水工具也开始投入抗旱保苗斗争。仅最近四天时间就浇了一百二十万亩旱象较重的秋田。洛阳专区的宜阳县提出“把沟水引上来，井水提上来，地下水挖出来，塘窖水打出来，一滴水一粒粮，有水皆用，点滴不漏”的口号。五万多名抗旱大军日夜奋战田间，苦战了两天，灌浇、点浇秋田三万一千二百亩，并兴修渠道八条，挖水井一百七十眼。信阳专区的潢川县在抗旱的同时，还修筑拦河坝、挖井开渠等八十六处，可扩大浇地面积九千三百多亩。中共许昌地委最近从地直机关抽调六百五十多名干部，由三个书记、四个地委委员和处、局长以上干部三十多人带领，组成十五个工作组，分赴抗旱前线。
