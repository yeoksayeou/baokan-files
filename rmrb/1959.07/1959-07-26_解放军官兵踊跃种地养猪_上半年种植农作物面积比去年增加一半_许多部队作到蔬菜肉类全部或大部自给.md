Xinhua News Agency, July 25th – The Chinese People's Liberation Army units conscientiously implement the General Political Department's instructions on the army's involvement in industrial and agricultural production. This year, agricultural and sideline production and diversified operations have developed greatly compared to last year. Many troops have achieved complete or substantial self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat, and have gradually established some agricultural and sideline production bases.

According to preliminary statistics for the first half of the year, the area planted with vegetables and crops by the entire army increased by more than 50% compared to last year, with over 102 million jin of vegetables already harvested. Pig raising increased by 47% compared to last year, and some were even used to support local areas. Cattle and sheep raising increased by more than one and a half times compared to last year. Chicken and duck raising increased by more than eight times compared to last year. Over 46 million fish were raised, and over 2.73 million fish were caught. Over 500,000 jin of kelp have been harvested. More than 2,700 workshops have been established, including flour mills, oil mills, tofu workshops, and sugarcane and grain processing plants. The troops stationed in Tibet have planted large quantities of vegetables, highland barley, and wheat this year, and are actively expanding pastures and accelerating livestock breeding. Many troops stationed along the coast have organized fishing teams to go to sea to catch fish and shrimp. Some troops stationed in mountainous areas have organized hunting teams to go into the mountains to hunt wild game. Many troops have also planted fruit trees around barracks, along roads, by rivers, and on hillsides.

This year's agricultural and sideline production in various units has been a concerted effort from top to bottom, with everyone participating. Leaders at all levels not only actively lead production but also take the lead in labor. From sailors and pilots to soldiers on the plateau, whether on duty or in training, most troops engage in agricultural and sideline production. Many family members of officers also actively participate in agricultural and sideline production labor.

In production, various units make full use of scattered land, planting wherever possible, "leaving no land uncultivated, no field empty." The leading organs of the Wuhan troops launched an activity of "everyone finding land to grow vegetables," planting vegetables on all available land in front of and behind houses, and along roads. A certain company stationed in the urban area of Wuhan used its spare time to reclaim wasteland on piles of rubble and broken bricks around its housing. After months of hard work, it has now harvested nearly 10,000 jin of vegetables. The Beijing troops actively reclaim scattered land, utilizing shooting ranges, drill grounds, and open spaces in the barracks to expand the cultivated area, striving for more planting and more harvesting. Many units have planted oil crops such as sunflowers and hemp along roadsides, ditch edges, and in front of and behind houses. The Zhejiang Military Region troops have changed the original "single-cropping" land to "multi-cropping" based on actual possibilities, improving land utilization. They also mobilized officers and soldiers to reclaim wasteland and plant vegetables and economic forests.

Various units have adopted a method of combining unified leadership, decentralized management, specialized production, and universal participation in voluntary labor, making overall arrangements for labor and production time, so that agricultural and sideline production does not affect the troops' training and other tasks and can be continuously developed.

    解放军官兵踊跃种地养猪
    上半年种植农作物面积比去年增加一半
    许多部队作到蔬菜肉类全部或大部自给
    据新华社25日讯　中国人民解放军各部队认真执行总政治部关于军队进行工农业生产的指示，今年农副业生产多种经营比去年有了很大发展。很多部队作到蔬菜、肉类全部或大部自给，并且逐步建立了一些农副业生产基地。
    据上半年初步统计，全军种植蔬菜与农作物的面积比去年增加了50％以上，已收蔬菜一亿零二百多万斤。养猪比去年增加了47％，一部分还支援了地方。喂牛羊比去年增加了一倍半多。养鸡鸭比去年增加了八倍多。养鱼四千六百多万尾，捕鱼二百七十三万多尾。种的海带已收获五十多万斤。开办作坊二千七百多座，其中包括粉坊、油坊、豆腐坊和甘蔗、粮食加工场等。驻西藏部队今年种植了大量蔬菜、青稞和小麦，并且积极扩大牧场，加速牲畜繁殖。许多驻在沿海的部队组织打鱼队，下海捕捞鱼虾。有些驻在山区的部队组织打猎队，上山猎取野味。许多部队还在营房周围、道路两旁、河边、山坡上种植了果树。
    各部队今年的农副业生产，都作到了上下前后，人人动手。各级首长不仅积极领导生产，而且带头劳动。各部队从水兵、飞行员到高原上的战士，或执勤部队，或训练部队，大都进行农副业生产。不少军官家属也积极参加了农副业生产的劳动。
    在生产中，各部队尽量利用零星土地，能种一块种一块，能种一棵种一棵，“不留一地，不空一场”。武汉部队领导机关开展了“人人找地种菜”的活动，把房前屋后，道路两旁，一切可以利用的土地都种上了菜。驻在武汉市区的某连队，利用业余时间在住房周围碎石乱砖堆上开荒，经过几个月的艰苦劳动，现已收到蔬菜近万斤。北京部队积极开垦零星土地，利用靶场、操场、营区空地，扩大耕种面积，力争多种多收。不少单位在道旁、沟沿、房前屋后种上了向日葵、大麻子等油料作物。浙江军区部队原来采用“一熟”制的土地，根据实际可能改为“多熟”制，提高了土地的利用率。他们还发动官兵开垦荒地，种植蔬菜和经济林。
    各部队采取统一领导、分散经营，专业生产和普遍参加义务劳动相结合的办法，对劳动力和生产时间作了统筹安排，使农副业生产既不影响部队的训练等任务，又能得到不断发展。
