    Xinhua News Agency Report: The People's Liberation Army has already sent over 100,000 cadres down to companies to serve as soldiers this year. This has played a significant role in improving leadership style, strengthening officer-soldier relations, and building the companies.

    Party committees at all levels have attached great importance to cadres serving as soldiers, and have made comprehensive arrangements. At the same time, they have also paid attention to organically integrating it with the overall tasks of the troops, assigning some cadres to pilot units and companies with weak performance. In organizing cadres to serve as soldiers, leading cadres have taken the lead. According to incomplete statistics, 75 generals have gone down to companies to serve as soldiers. Most of them have chosen the most arduous places to serve, tempering their thinking and work style. Air Force Political Commissar Lieutenant General Wu Faxian and Political Department Director Lieutenant General Wang Huiqiu have successively gone down to airfields to serve as soldiers, working alongside soldiers to wipe down airplanes and study technology. Soldiers in a certain unit in Beijing composed a jingle to praise their commander, Major General Cheng Shaofu: "The sun rises in the east, a sea of red, an old hero has come to our class. Officers and soldiers share joys and sorrows, Communism has a good work style!"

    Before going down to the companies this year, cadres generally made more thorough preparations to improve their work style and enhance their thinking. They were all determined to gain more experience in the one-month soldier life. After arriving at the companies, they ate, lived, and worked with the soldiers, treating each other as equals and respecting the leadership of the squad and platoon leaders, thus gaining a lot. Platoon Leader Nong Xiuhua of a certain unit used to think that he often worked with the soldiers and didn't have any bureaucratic tendencies. During his time as a soldier, because he was able to put aside his airs and take the lead in everything, a soldier who had been criticized by him before told him his innermost thoughts: "I used to be afraid to approach you boldly, but now I feel that you are very kind and are my close comrade-in-arms." This greatly inspired Nong Xiuhua. He said that only by serving as a soldier can he truly form close friendships with the soldiers. After serving as a soldier, Lieutenant General Guo Peng of a certain unit wrote an article summarizing his experience, saying: "The grassroots level of the army is the company. 'Thousands of small rivers flow into the sea, and all tasks come down to the company.' If you lack an in-depth and detailed understanding of the grassroots work of the company, it will be difficult to make your leadership practical."

    Cadre service as soldiers has greatly promoted the construction of the companies. When Major General Li Shuiqing of a certain unit served as a soldier in the fourth squad of the fourth company, under his leadership and influence, the squad's construction operation rate continued to increase. After the general left, they created a record of digging three meters in eight hours. They took this achievement, along with the vegetables and sheep that the general had personally planted and raised in the squad, to visit the general and report the good news to him. After Sun Fangpu, political commissar of a certain division, served as a soldier in the tank unit, he put forward active improvement measures for tank command, making the tank unit an excellent unit. Many originally weak companies have become advanced units under the influence and help of the cadres serving as soldiers.

    In the nearly one year since the army implemented the system of cadres serving as soldiers, the connection between leading organs and leaders at all levels and the soldiers and masses has been greatly strengthened. The broad masses of cadres have made friends among the soldiers, and often correspond with each other and visit each other. After Xiang Guang, a colonel from a certain unit, served as a soldier, he maintained contact with the soldiers. During festivals and holidays, the soldiers came to his home in groups of three or five to play, chat together, and discuss the situation of the company, like old friends. He said: "This is the result of being a soldier. In the past, when inspecting work and planting experimental fields, I also had contact with the soldiers, but it was not as profound as the friendship I forged this time as a soldier. This is a new type of officer-soldier relationship." A certain company of the Shenyang troops sent representatives to visit Lieutenant General Cheng Shicai, who had served as a soldier in the company. The first thing the general asked was: "Are all the comrades in the company doing well? Is our squad leader doing well?" The ninth squad of a certain company of the troops stationed on an island on the Fujian front line won the red flag in the red flag competition and immediately wrote a letter to General Xiong Zhaoren, who had served as a soldier in the squad, to report the good news. After the troops stationed in the border areas of our country implemented the system of cadres serving as soldiers, it also promoted friendship and unity between officers and soldiers. A certain cavalry unit in Xinjiang is composed of nine ethnic groups including Uyghur, Tajik, Han, Hui, Mongolian, and Tatar. After Battalion Commander Tohuti became a cook, he rushed to cook meals and picked up large bundles of firewood, which greatly moved the soldiers of all ethnic groups. During the Qurban Festival, Tursun Halmu, the squad leader of a certain unit, specially reserved mutton for the Han officers serving as soldiers. The cadres serving as soldiers get along with the soldiers of all ethnic groups like brothers. (Attached picture)

### 锻炼了思想　改进了作风　加强了团结  解放军十万干部下连当兵

    锻炼了思想　改进了作风　加强了团结
    解放军十万干部下连当兵
    本报讯　人民解放军今年已有十万余干部下连当兵，这对领导作风的改进、密切官兵关系和连队建设，起了重大作用。
    各级党委都很重视干部当兵，并且作了全面安排，同时还注意了同部队的整个任务有机结合，把一些干部分配到试点单位和工作薄弱的连队。在组织干部当兵中，都是领导干部带头当兵，据不完全统计，已有七十五名将军下连当兵。他们多是选择了最艰苦的地方当兵，锻炼自己的思想和作风。空军政治委员吴法宪中将、政治部主任王辉球中将，先后下到机场当兵，跟士兵一起擦飞机，研究技术。北京某部队一个班的战士，编了一首快板赞扬他们的军长成少甫少将：“日出东方一片红，俺班来了个老英雄，官兵一致同甘苦，共产主义好作风！”
    今年干部在下连队前，一般都做了较充分的改进作风、提高思想的准备，都决心在一个月的士兵生活中得到更多的锻炼。到连队后，他们同战士同吃、同住、同劳动，平等相处，尊重班排领导，因而收获很大。某部排长农修华过去认为自己经常同战士一起，没什么官僚作风，在当兵期间，由于他能放下架子，事事带头，一个从前被他批评过的战士对他谈出心里话说：“我从前对你不敢大胆接近，现在才觉得你很亲切，是我的亲密战友。”这话对农修华启发很大，他说只有当兵才能真正同战士结成知交。某部郭鹏中将当兵后，写了一篇文章总结他当兵的体会说：“军队的基层是连队，‘千条小河归大海，万件工作下连来’。如果对连队基层工作缺乏深入细致的了解，就很难使自己的领导切合实际。”
    干部当兵大大推动了连队的建设，某部李水清少将在四连四班当兵时，在他的带动和影响下，这个班的施工作业率不断提高。在将军离开后，又创造了八小时掘进三米的纪录。他们把这一成绩和将军在班里亲手种的菜、养的羊一起带着去看望将军，向将军报喜。某师政委孙芳圃在坦克部队当兵后，就对坦克指挥等提出了积极改进措施，使坦克部队成了优良单位。很多原来工作薄弱的连队，都在当兵干部的影响和帮助下，变为先进单位。
    部队执行干部当兵制度近一年来，各级领导机关和各级首长同士兵群众的联系大大增强了。广大干部在士兵中间交了朋友，相互之间经常通信，经常来往探望。某部上校向光当兵后，还同战士保持了联系，在节日和假日，战士们都三五成群到他家里去玩，一齐谈天，讨论连队情况，像老朋友一样。他说：
  “这是当兵的成果，过去检查工作、种试验田，也同战士们有过联系，但远不如这次当兵结下的友谊深厚，这是新型的官兵关系。”沈阳部队某连派代表去看望曾在连里当兵的程世才中将，将军头句话就问：“全连同志好吗？我们的班长也好吗？”福建前线驻海岛部队某连九班，在红旗竞赛中得到红旗，马上给在班里当过兵的熊兆仁将军写了报喜信。在我国边疆地区的驻军实行干部当兵后，也促进了官兵友谊和团结。新疆某骑兵部队是由维吾尔、塔吉克、汉、回、蒙、塔塔尔等九个民族组成的。后勤主任托乎提大尉当了炊事兵后，做饭抢着干，背柴火拣大捆，各族战士十分感动。过库尔班节时，某部班长吐尔逊·哈尔木还特地给当兵的汉族军官留了羊肉。当兵干部同各族战士相处如同兄弟一般。（附图片）
