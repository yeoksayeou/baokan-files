    Rationally Arrange Time
    Bai Sheng
    Education is a work of cultivating people for a hundred years, a difficult and complex task. With the rapid development of socialist construction, the task of schools to train construction talents for the country is increasing day by day. This task mainly falls on the shoulders of teachers. Therefore, how the Party organizations and administrative leaders of schools can help teachers arrange their working time according to the characteristics of teachers' work, so that teachers have sufficient time to work hard on teaching work such as preparing lessons, lecturing, and correcting homework, and improve teaching quality, is of great significance.
    In the past year or so, various types of schools have implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, which has brought tremendous changes and development to school work. Productive labor has been incorporated into the teaching plan, and school work is more burdensome than in the past. Under such circumstances, in order to further ensure the normal progress of teaching work, all the work arranged in the school must revolve around the central link of teaching work. School leaders should especially strengthen the leadership of teachers' work, go deep into teaching practice frequently, investigate and research, understand teachers' teaching situation and the difficulties and problems existing in teaching, and help solve them in a timely manner. In helping teachers solve difficulties, an important issue is to rationally arrange time. Only with good time arrangement can teachers have ample time to prepare lessons and correct homework. The middle and primary schools in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, have done a lot of work and achieved remarkable results in helping teachers comprehensively arrange teaching work and improve teaching quality. In particular, the arrangement of time and the control of meetings allow teachers to spend most of their time on teaching work, thus creating a new atmosphere of meticulousness, teaching in depth and thoroughly in teaching. Now, many schools pay attention to the arrangement of teachers' work while arranging teaching and productive labor time, which is very necessary.
    However, there are also some schools that have not yet paid attention to and properly arranged the work of teachers; some have made arrangements, but the time for teachers' teaching activities and self-study and further education is not sufficient. It must be recognized that if teachers do not have enough time to engage in teaching work, and if they do not have the necessary sufficient time for further education and lesson preparation, it is impossible to teach students well. Therefore, Party and government leaders in schools must not only arrange teachers' teaching work well, allowing teachers to have sufficient time for teaching work, but also care for and help teachers who are not good at managing their own time, so that they can truly rationally allocate their rest time to teaching and further education. If teachers can work during working hours and rest during rest hours, and rationally arrange teaching work, then the teaching quality of teachers and the learning performance of students will continuously improve.

    合理安排时间
    柏生
    教育工作是百年树人的工作，是一项艰巨复杂的任务。随着社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，学校为国家培养建设人才的任务日益加大。这个任务，主要落在教师的肩上。因此，学校的党组织和行政领导，如何根据教师工作的特点，帮助教师安排工作时间，使教师们有充分的时间，努力作好备课、讲课、批改作业等教学工作，提高教学质量，就有着非常重要的意义。
    一年多来，各类学校贯彻执行了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，使学校工作有了巨大的变化和发展，生产劳动纳入了教学计划，学校工作比过去繁重了。在这种情况下，为了进一步保证教学工作的正常进行，学校里安排的各项工作，都要围绕着教学工作这一个中心环节。学校领导要特别加强对教师工作的领导，经常深入教学实际，调查研究，了解教师教学情况和教学中存在的困难和问题，并及时帮助解决。在帮助教师解决困难方面，重要的一个问题是合理安排时间。时间安排得好，才能使教师有充裕的时间备课和批改作业。黑龙江肇东县中、小学在帮助教师全面安排教学工作、提高教学质量方面，作了不少工作，也取得了显著成效。特别是时间的安排和会议的控制，使教师可以把大部时间用到教学工作上去，因而在教学上出现了精雕细刻、教深教透的新风气。现在，许多学校在安排教学和生产劳动时间的同时，也注意了对教师工作的安排，这样做是很必要的。
    但是，也有一些学校，至今还没有注意和妥善地安排教师的工作；有些虽然做了安排，但对教师的教学活动以及自学进修时间安排的还不够充分。必须认识到，教师如果没有充分的时间从事教学工作，如果没有必要的足够的时间进修和备课，要想把学生教好是不可能的。因此，学校中的党政领导既要安排好教师的教学工作，让教师有充分时间作教学工作，同时，还要关怀和帮助不善于支配自己时间的教师，让他们真的能够合理支配休息时间，用到教学和进修上去。如果教师们能够在工作时间工作，休息时间休息，合理安排好教学工作，那就会不断提高教师的教学质量和学生的学习成绩。
