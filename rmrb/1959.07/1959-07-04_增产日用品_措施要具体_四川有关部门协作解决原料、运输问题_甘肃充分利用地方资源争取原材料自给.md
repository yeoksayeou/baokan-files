Increase Production of Daily Necessities with Concrete Measures
	Sichuan Relevant Departments Cooperate to Solve Raw Material and Transportation Problems
	Gansu Fully Utilizes Local Resources to Strive for Self-Sufficiency in Raw Materials

    This newspaper reports: Under the principle of unified arrangement, the relevant units in Sichuan Province fully promote the spirit of cooperation and actively assist the light industry departments in solving raw material, fuel, and transportation problems to support the increased production of daily necessities.

    According to the recent instructions of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, all localities in Sichuan have regarded assisting the light industry departments in solving raw material and fuel problems as one of the main tasks at present, while arranging support for heavy industry. Since June, light industrial raw materials transferred from various places to industrial cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Zigong, and Yibin have been increasing substantially. Among them, the main raw materials such as raw cotton, wood, and caustic soda have increased by 50% to more than double the monthly average from January to May. The papermaking raw materials, which were once very tight, have recently seen the commercial departments dispatching a large number of people to strengthen the collection of papermaking fibers and waste paper. In June alone, more than 2 million catties of waste paper were collected; local chemical plants also supply 40 tons of caustic soda daily to the two major paper mills, Yibin and Chongqing 601, to support the papermaking industry in increasing the production of newsprint and textbook paper.

    More than 70% of Sichuan's light industrial raw materials come from rural areas. In order to ensure the supply of light industrial raw materials in the future, the province is now implementing the method of designated areas for fixed-point, contracted supply. The special districts near Chongqing, Chengdu, and Yibin are directly signing supply contracts for three types of materials with the light industrial factories in these cities. The light industrial departments and commercial departments jointly organize the purchase to restore the original urban-rural cooperation relationship. The raw materials needed by light industry in the third quarter are being urgently allocated, of which more than 20,000 tons of papermaking raw materials and about 600 tons of wood oil are planned to be allocated in July.

    After the supply of materials produced by light industry increases, the transportation departments, in addition to allocating special transportation tools, also guarantee the timely transportation of raw materials and fuels for light industry by organizing rational transportation and utilizing empty return vehicles and ships. When arranging the transportation tasks of steel, grain, etc., railways, highways, and inland rivers also include the main materials related to light industrial production in the plan at the same time, especially important materials such as raw cotton, papermaking fiber, and coal are transported to the factories in a timely manner. The key to transportation at present lies in short-distance concentration and transportation. In this regard, each special district is responsible for arranging transportation tools and labor to ensure that important materials are first concentrated to the traffic lines, so that the trunk line transportation is unimpeded. After the people's communes in Neijiang Special District reasonably organized labor and transportation tools, they will be able to transport more than 10 million catties of papermaking raw materials to the railway line in the first half of July.

    Regarding the supply of fuel and electricity to the light industry departments, the Sichuan Provincial Coal Department and the Electricity Department have tried their best to meet the production requirements of major factories after adjustments. The Coal Department has implemented regional counterpart and unified allocation of indicators for the power coal used by major light industrial industries in Chongqing, Zigong, and Yibin to ensure supply. The production of some textile mills and paper mills in Chongqing and Yibin was originally affected due to tight power supply. After recent adjustments, the production of the textile and papermaking industries has gradually returned to normal.

    This newspaper, Lanzhou, July 3rd - Gansu Province is adopting a self-reliant method, fully utilizing local resources, to achieve self-sufficiency in some light industrial raw materials that have always relied on supply from other places.

    Most of the more than 900 light industrial factories above the county level in Gansu Province were newly established in recent years. Due to the weak foundation, a considerable part of the required raw materials relies on supply from other provinces, of which about 95% of chemical products have to be transported from other provinces. Since the beginning of this year, Gansu Province has paid attention to organizing the production and supply of raw materials; recently, in order to produce more daily-use industrial products, it has further taken measures to plan the production and supply of more than 20 kinds of urgently needed raw materials. Among them, it is required that paper pulp, alum, mirabilite, thermos bottle bamboo shells, and chemical raw materials for enamel be completely self-sufficient. Roasted glue, red alum, rosin, wool oil, soda ash, caustic soda, borax, etc. should solve 40%-80% by themselves. This makes the raw material supply in the second half of the year obtain a practical guarantee and catches up with the needs of production. According to the province's resources and production capacity, more than a dozen raw material production bases for paper pulp, roasted glue, alum, and rosin have been established. These bases have now completed resource investigation and design and are successively starting construction, and some have already partially started production. Among them, the newly built paper pulp mill in Longxi County alone can meet one-half of the province's paper pulp needs in the second half of the year with existing raw materials and equipment. Light industrial factories have also actively sent people to the mountains to find resources. The oil extraction factories located in Tianshui, Zhangye, and Pingliang Special Districts, which are rich in wild oil crops, have sent workers and technicians to the mountains to investigate resources and organize production in conjunction with the communes. The director of the Lanzhou Leather Factory personally led people to the remote Gannan grassland to purchase 100,000 catties of raw materials such as oak shells and ephedra for making roasted glue.

    In order to expand the production of raw materials, some factories only need to increase a small amount of equipment to meet the processing of raw materials, so they are trying to expand; the province has allocated a batch of steel, pig iron, cement, wood, and electric motors to supply the equipment needed by the raw material industry.

    Gansu Province has also determined to establish the concept of industrial and commercial cooperation and a unified chessboard under the principle of making the best use of everything and to conduct a major adjustment of the inventory of raw materials and to arrange for unified use. At the recently held provincial materials exchange conference alone, more than 5,000 tons of various agricultural and sideline products and chemical raw materials were cleared and transferred to support light industrial factories in Lanzhou. Materials exchange meetings at all levels below the special district will also be held successively. Commercial departments at all levels also carry out waste product recycling to support light industrial production. Lanzhou City collected 2,500 tons of various waste products in one month. The transportation department also established a special agency and transferred a batch of cars and horse-drawn carts to provide transportation for light industrial raw materials. At present, a batch of materials existing in various places is being transported to Lanzhou. (Lan Ping)

    增产日用品  措施要具体
    四川有关部门协作解决原料、运输问题
    甘肃充分利用地方资源争取原材料自给
    本报讯　四川省各有关单位在统一安排的原则下，充分发扬协作精神，积极协助轻工业部门解决原料、燃料和运输问题，支援轻工业增产日用品。
    根据中共四川省委最近多次的指示，四川各地化工、煤炭、电力、运输、商业等部门和各专区在安排支援重工业的同时，把协助轻工业部门解决原料和燃料问题也作为当前的主要任务之一。6月份以来，从各地调往重庆、成都、自贡、宜宾等工业城市的轻工业原料正在大量增加。其中原棉、木材、烧碱等主要原料分别比1至5月份平均每月增加了50％到一倍以上。曾经一度十分紧张的造纸原料，商业部门最近出动了大批人员加强造纸纤维和废纸的收购工作，仅6月份收购的废纸就有二百多万斤；各地化工厂每天也以四十吨烧碱供应宜宾和重庆601两大纸厂，支援造纸工业增产新闻纸和课本纸。
    四川省轻工业原料70％以上来自农村，为了使今后轻工业原料供应得到保证，目前全省已实行划片定点、包干供应的办法。重庆、成都、宜宾附近各专区正与这些城市的轻工业工厂直接签订三类物资供应合同，由轻工业部门与商业部门共同组织收购，恢复原来的城乡协作关系。第三季度轻工业需要的原料，各地正在抓紧调拨，其中7月份计划调拨的造纸原料就有二万多吨，木油六百吨左右。
    轻工业生产的物资供应量增加后，运输部门除了调拨专用运输工具外，还通过组织合理运输，利用回空车船保证轻工业原料和燃料的及时调运。铁路、公路、内河在安排钢铁、粮食等运输任务时，对有关轻工业生产的主要物资也同时列入计划，特别是对原棉、造纸纤维、煤炭等重要物资都及时运到了工厂。当前运输上的关键在于短途集运，这方面已由各专区负责安排运输工具和劳动力，首先保证将重要物资集运到交通沿线，使干线运输畅通无阻。内江专区各人民公社合理组织劳动力和运输工具后，7月上半月就可将一千多万斤造纸原料全部运到铁路线上。
    对轻工业部门燃料和电力的供应，四川省煤炭厅和电力厅经过调整后，都争取尽量做到满足主要工厂生产的要求。煤炭厅对重庆、自贡、宜宾主要轻工业行业的动力用煤，已实行分地区对口，全省统一下达指标，保证供应。重庆、宜宾两地原来因为电力供应紧张，影响了一部分纺织厂和造纸厂生产，最近调整后，纺织和造纸工业生产已逐步恢复正常。
    本报兰州3日电　甘肃省采取自力更生的方法，充分利用地方资源，使一部分一向需要外地供应的轻工业原料材料达到自给。
    甘肃全省现有的县以上的九百多个轻工业工厂，大都是近几年新建立起来的。由于基础薄弱，所需原料材料，相当大的部分要依靠外省供应，其中像化工产品要从外省运进95％左右。从今年年初起，甘肃省就注意了组织原料材料的生产和供应；最近为了生产更多的日用工业品，又进一步采取措施，对当前迫切需要的二十多种原料材料作了生产与供应的规划，其中要求纸浆、明矾、芒硝、保温瓶竹壳和搪瓷用化工原料等全部自给自足，烤胶、红矾、松香和毛油、纯碱、烧碱、硼砂等分别自行解决40％—80％。这就使下半年的原料材料供应获得切实的保证，并赶上了生产的需要。根据全省各地资源和生产能力等条件，分别建立纸浆、烤胶、明矾、松香等十多处原料生产基地。这些基地现在都完成了资源调查和设计，并且陆续动工建厂，有的已经局部开始生产。其中仅陇西县新建的纸浆厂，用现有的原料和设备生产，就可以满足全省下半年所需纸浆的二分之一。各轻工业工厂也都积极派人深入山区寻找资源。设在盛产野生油料的天水、张掖和平凉专区的榨油厂，都派出工人和技术人员进山调查资源，和公社挂钩组织生产。兰州皮革厂厂长亲自带人到偏僻的甘南草原一带收购了十万斤橡壳、麻黄草等制烤胶的原料。
    为了扩大原材料的生产，有些工厂只需增加少许设备即可满足原材料加工的，就设法扩充；对原料材料工业所需的设备，全省已拨出一批钢材、生铁、水泥、木材和电动机，供应使用。
    甘肃省还确定在物尽其用的原则下，树立工商协作和一盘棋思想，对库存的原料材料进行一次大调整，统一安排使用。仅在最近召开的省物资交流大会上，就清理调出各种农副产品和化工原料五千余吨，支援了兰州各轻工业工厂。专区以下各级物资交流会也将陆续召开。各级商业部门还开展废品回收，支援轻工业生产。兰州市在一月内就收得各种废品二千五百吨。交通部门也成立了专门机构，抽调一批汽车和马车，专供轻工业原材料的运输，目前正将现存各地的一批物资源源运向兰州。　（蓝坪）
