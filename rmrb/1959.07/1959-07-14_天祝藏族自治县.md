Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County is located in the southeastern part of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu. It borders the original Yongdeng County to the east and south, Huzhu and Menyuan in Qinghai to the west, Minhe and Ledu in Qinghai to the southwest, and Yongchang and Wuwei to the northeast. In 1958, the entire Gulang County was placed under its jurisdiction. The county covers an area of more than 6,000 square kilometers. It has a population of 230,000, including Tibetan, Han, Tu, Mongolian, Hui, Dong, Manchu, Dongxiang, and Salar ethnic groups. Regional autonomy was implemented on May 6, 1950, and the People's Government of Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region was established. On July 19, 1955, it was changed to Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County.

Before liberation, all the land here was owned by temples and landlords, and land rent ranged from 20% to 50%. Usury was very serious; generally, borrowing one dou of grain required adding 0.5 to 1 dou of interest. If it was not repaid in the current year, interest would be compounded the following year, making people's lives extremely miserable. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups gradually realized socialist transformation and various economic constructions. In addition to great development in agriculture and animal husbandry after liberation, the county has now established 3,782 factories and mines in industry, such as metallurgy, machinery, and agricultural tool manufacturing. The newly built Tianzhu Oil Refinery has refined eleven types of gasoline, light and heavy diesel, etc., that meet the standards. The total industrial output value in 1958 increased 32 times compared with 1952. There has also been great development in culture and education throughout the county. By 1958, there were 374 primary and secondary schools in the county, with more than 42,400 students enrolled. In addition, 14 hospitals were established, ensuring the health of the people of all ethnic groups.

    天祝藏族自治县
    天祝藏族自治县位于甘肃河西走廊的东南部。东面和南面界原?兰县，西界青海互助、亹源，西南界青海民和、乐都，东北界永昌、武威，一九五八年古浪县全部划入该县管辖。全县面积六千多平方公里。人口二十三万，包括藏、汉、土、蒙、回、侗、满、东乡、撒拉等族。一九五○年五月六日实行区域自治，成立了天祝藏族自治区人民政府。一九五五年七月十九日改为天祝藏族自治县。
    解放前，这里的土地全部为寺院和地主所有，地租从二八到对半不等。高利贷剥削很严重，普遍借粮一斗，加息五升到一斗，本年未还，第二年利上加利，人民生活痛苦不堪。解放后，各族人民在党的领导下，逐步实现了社会主义改造和各项经济建设。该县解放后除农牧业有很大发展外，在工业方面，到现在已建立起冶金、机械、农具制造等厂矿三千七百八十二个。新建的天祝炼油厂，已炼出合乎规格的汽油、轻重柴油等十一种。一九五八年工业总产值比一九五二年增加了三十二倍。全县在文化教育方面，也有很大发展，到一九五八年全县有中小学三百七十四所，入学人数达四万二千四百多人。此外建立了医院十四处，保证了各族人民身体健康。
