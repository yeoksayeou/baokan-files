Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 3rd. Reporter Liu Yangshen reports: More than 20,000 Miao people in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture celebrated their first Dragon Boat Festival since communization, wishing for a bumper harvest this year.

On June 30th, on the river surface near Shidong Town, in the middle reaches of the Clear Water River, drums pounded, iron cannons roared, and twenty-five red-decorated dragon boats, paddled by Miao athletes, cut through the tranquil blue waves, speeding and competing, with cheers from the audience on both banks shaking the fields. While racing dragon boats, Miao men and women commune members danced the Lusheng dance and the drum dance by the river, and held ball games, tug-of-war, horse racing and other activities.

The Dragon Boat Festival is a traditional grand festival for the Miao people in the Qiandongnan area, held every year on the 25th day of the fifth lunar month in the scenic Shidong Town, Jianhe County. After liberation, the Miao people's Dragon Boat Festival has become more lively year by year. Especially after the people's communes were established, commune members' enthusiasm was particularly high. This year, wheat production has greatly increased, and every household has received cash income from the summer harvest distribution. Rice transplanting was also completed more than half a month earlier than last year, which made this year's Dragon Boat Festival even more colorful.

On this day, the banks of the Clear Water River in Shidong Town were crowded with people, and gorgeously dressed male and female commune members came to participate in the grand event, bringing the old and the young with them. At 3 p.m., the dragon boats of each production team arrived one after another. Liu Jincheng, Secretary of the Shidong People's Commune Party Committee, according to traditional customs, hung a red silk cloth on the first dragon boat to express congratulations. Then, the dragon boat race began. On the river surface, dragon boats more than seven feet long, made up of three dugouts, were like dragons in legends, chasing and playing in the water, agile and flying. Most of the forty paddlers on each boat are production models of the commune. The Fangzhai Production Team was rated as an advanced production team at the commune model meeting that closed in the morning, and won the first place in the dragon boat race in the afternoon. The person who beats the drum at the bow of the boat has always been a respected person in the village. The Miao people often elect the Communist Party members or leaders of the Party organization they trust most as drummers. The masses said: Party members will lead everyone to work and produce together, and also lead everyone to entertain and rest together, sharing weal and woe with us.

On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, the commercial departments of Qiandongnan also held a material exchange meeting, supplying various daily necessities in a timely manner and purchasing rural products. (Attached picture)

    清水江上蛟龙如飞追逐戏水
    贵州苗族欢度龙船节
    新华社贵阳3日电　记者刘扬深报道：黔东南苗族侗族自治州两万多苗族人民欢度公社化以后的第一个龙船节，预祝今年大丰收。
    6月30日，清水江中游施洞镇边的江面上，锣鼓咚咚，铁铳轰鸣，由苗族健儿把桨的二十五艘披红挂彩的龙船，划破宁静的碧波，疾驶争游，两岸观众欢声震野。在划龙船的同时，苗族男女社员在江边跳起了芦笙舞和踩鼓舞，举行了球赛、拔河、赛马等活动。
    龙船节是黔东南地区苗族人民的一个传统盛大节日，每年阴历五月二十五日在风景秀丽的剑河县施洞镇举行。解放后，苗族人民的龙船节一年比一年热闹。特别是人民公社化以后，社员干劲分外昂扬，今年小麦产量大大增加，家家户户从夏收分配中得到了现金收入，水稻栽秧也比去年提早半个多月完成，这就使今年的龙船节更加丰富多彩。
    在这一天，施洞镇清水江两岸人山人海，盛装的男女社员们扶老携幼赶来参加盛会。午后三时，各个生产队的龙船陆续到齐，施洞人民公社党委书记刘金城根据传统习惯，为第一艘龙船挂红绸，表示祝贺，接着，就开始龙舟比赛。江面上，七丈多长、由三只独木舟拼成的龙船，就像传说中的蛟龙一样，追逐戏水，矫健如飞。每只舟上的四十多个划船手，大部分是公社的生产模范。方寨生产队在上午闭幕的公社模范大会上被评为先进生产队，下午在龙船比赛中又夺得了第一名。坐在船头打鼓的人向来是村寨里德高望重的人，苗族人民往往推选他们最信赖的共产党员或党组织的领导人当鼓手。群众说：党员们会带领大伙一起劳动生产也会带领大伙一起娱乐休息，和我们同甘共苦。
    在龙船节这天，黔东南商业部门还举行了物资交流会，及时供应各种日用百货，收购农村产品。（附图片）
