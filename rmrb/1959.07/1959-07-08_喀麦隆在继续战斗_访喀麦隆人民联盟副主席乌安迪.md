    Cameroon Continues to Fight
    —An Interview with Ouandi, Vice-Chairman of the Cameroonian People's Union
    Imperialists say in the United Nations that the Cameroonian people have left the Cameroonian People's Union. Is the situation in Cameroon really as peaceful as the imperialists portray it? Our reporter recently interviewed Mr. Ouandi, Vice-Chairman of the Cameroonian People's Union, in Beijing, who told us that the facts are exactly the opposite of the imperialists’ lies, and that the Cameroonian people are continuing to fight under the leadership of the Cameroonian People's Union.
    Mr. Ouandi told us that on July 1st, the second day after he arrived in Beijing, he received a telegram from Dr. Moumié, Chairman of the Cameroonian People's Union, from Cairo. Upon opening the telegram, it turned out to be a report of victory for the Cameroonian patriots who attacked the French colonialists.
    On the evening of June 27th, thirty Cameroonian patriots launched three successive surprise attacks in the French colonialist-occupied port city of Douala. Using submachine guns and other weapons, they killed six French colonialists and their lackeys, including one French officer and one French gendarme; twenty-five were seriously injured, including ten French colonialists.
    After the incident, the French colonial authorities immediately dispatched troops to assist the police in "maintaining order." A curfew was imposed throughout Douala. The situation remained tense the next day, with large numbers of colonial troops still patrolling the streets and European residential areas with guns.
    Speaking of this telegram, Mr. Ouandi was filled with the joy of victory. He said: "For independence and freedom, the Cameroonian people are continuing to fight in this way."
    Mr. Ouandi participated in the patriotic struggle of the Cameroonian people as early as when he was a primary school teacher. When the Cameroonian People's Union, the largest political organization in Cameroon, was established in 1948, he joined the Union and was elected its Vice-Chairman in 1952. For more than a decade, he has been a staunch fighter for the Cameroonian national independence struggle.
    At the beginning of our interview, Mr. Ouandi spoke indignantly about the United Nations General Assembly resolution on the Cameroonian issue. He said that everyone knows that this resolution, passed by the United Nations General Assembly in March this year under the manipulation of the United States, Britain, and France, only formally declared that French Cameroon would be "independent" on January 1, 1960, without mentioning the future of the part of Cameroon occupied by Britain. Furthermore, the resolution did not stipulate that a general election be held in Cameroon before independence, so that Cameroon could achieve genuine independence.
      "This has made the Cameroonian people realize once again that independence cannot rely on the United Nations' gift, but must be won through struggle. Therefore, the Cameroonian people have decided to continue fighting until they achieve genuine independence!" Mr. Ouandi said firmly.
    Although the colonialists, like foxes, made promises and agreed that Cameroon would be "independent" on January 1, 1960, how would the colonialists fulfill their promises? Mr. Ouandi told us that in order to maintain their colonial rule there forever after Cameroon's "independence" and continue to devour the blood and sweat of the Cameroonian people, they are still employing various fascist and bloody methods to more cruelly suppress the Cameroonian people. Thus, on the sacred land of Cameroon, more shocking things have happened. The tortures inflicted by the colonialists and their lackeys on the good people have reached the point of inhumanity and outrage.
    In the Sanaga area, the French colonialists once arrested many Cameroonian patriots. They wanted to cruelly execute these patriots. They dug many pits in the wild, each as deep as a person. Then they made these patriots stand in the pits and drove others to fill the pits with earth, burying them up to their necks, leaving only the heads of the victims exposed. They were suffocated alive. In another place, such a thing happened: the colonialists dug a large pit in the ground, drove a group of patriots into the pit, then covered the pit tightly with iron sheets, and then lit a fire on the iron sheets. The iron sheets burned red hot, and the patriots died miserably in the pit. The colonialists took pleasure in killing people. They arrested patriots, stripped them naked, cut a circle of flesh from their necks with knives, and then cut off the flesh from their chests. Blood immediately stained their necks and chests red. At this time, the colonialists cruelly pointed to the patriots who were suffering and said, "This is wearing the red scarf of communism." As for the colonialists' gang rapes of women, cutting open the bellies of pregnant women, and stuffing patriots into sacks and throwing them into the river, such things are common occurrences.
    When denouncing the colonialists' atrocities, Mr. Ouandi was filled with boundless hatred for the colonialists. He said indignantly: "I simply cannot bear to repeat those bloody atrocities here."
    "Violence must be countered with violence. The more brutal the colonialists are, the more the people's struggle against them develops." Mr. Ouandi then introduced us to the situation of the Cameroonian people's heroic struggle. He said that the Cameroonian people have not been frightened by this. The lessons of blood have made the Cameroonian people deeply understand that independence and freedom can never rely on the colonialists' gift, but require resolute struggle. The entire population of Cameroon is continuing to fight. More and more passionate young people are stepping forward to the forest areas to join the guerrillas. The elderly are using their strength in their later years to lead the way and transport supplies for the guerrillas. The women have also extraordinarily undertaken many reconnaissance tasks. With the support of the people, the guerrillas often rush out of the densely forested areas and use various methods to attack the enemy and achieve victory.
    Mr. Ouandi told us two battle stories:
    Bamiléké is an area where many patriots are active, which has made the colonial army and reactionaries very annoyed. One day, ten fully armed French soldiers came here in a truck, rushing around and arresting people indiscriminately. As a result, fifty patriots were arrested and put on the truck. The colonial beasts thought they could return in triumph. They never expected that the women here were also conscious patriots. A group of women decided to rescue the arrested people. They came up with a plan, colluded with each other, and rushed out of the village ahead of the enemy's car, arriving near a river ditch. A makeshift bridge was built over this river with branches and tree trunks, which was a necessary passage for cars. They worked together to destroy the makeshift bridge. After a while, the truck carrying the patriots arrived. Seeing that they could not pass, the enemy soldiers got out of the car to repair it. The women took this opportunity to fight with the enemy soldiers. The riverside was in chaos for a while. Finally, several women were arrested, but the fifty patriots on the car jumped out of the car at this time and successfully sneaked into the mountains and forests. A greater fighting force has been preserved, and new battles continue to be fought in the Bamiléké area.
    There is also such a story of a guerrilla team in the Sanaga coastal area who surprisingly won a victory: The Sanaga guerrillas had long planned to give the colonial army a big lesson, but they had no guns and no good opportunity to strike. One day, the guerrillas learned that a group of colonial troops had come out on patrol. They saw that this was precisely the "food" delivered to their mouths, so they devised a "clever plan to capture the enemy" and decided to take care of it and arm themselves. On the road where the enemy soldiers were walking, a group of female guerrillas dressed as ordinary peasant women and walked towards the enemy soldiers. Seeing that they were women, the enemy soldiers did not pay attention to them. When they got closer, the women rushed up together and sprinkled the chili powder they had prepared on the faces of the enemy soldiers. The chili powder got into the eyes and noses of the enemy soldiers, stinging their eyes and causing them to shed tears. It was impossible for the enemy soldiers to open their eyes to see, and they were even more flustered. At this time, the guerrillas who had been ambushing in the grass on the side of the road jumped out like tigers pouncing on their prey. When the enemy soldiers woke up, they realized that their guns had been confiscated by the guerrillas and they themselves had become prisoners.
    The colonialists' economic plunder has made the economic situation in Cameroon worse and worse, with unemployment and poverty everywhere. According to statistics, among the 150,000 people in Douala, the economic capital of Cameroon, more than 17,000 are unemployed, accounting for 36.4% of the labor force. The people are unwilling to submit to adversity, and the struggle for independence and freedom is spread throughout the fields and factories, villages and cities. Concerted strike struggles occur frequently. In the agricultural center of Cameroon, the banana plantation workers in Mongo held a large-scale strike for several weeks in June. Bank clerks in Douala, hydroelectric workers in Yaoundé, and agricultural workers in Foumban all held large-scale strikes. Even the French colonialists had to admit that these strikes went beyond the economic scope and had political overtones. The patriotic guerrilla warfare that is spread throughout the country and the strikes that occur from time to time constitute an irresistible tide of the Cameroonian people's struggle for independence.
    Mr. Ouandi said: "The Cameroonian people are fighting for national independence and for world peace. We absolutely do not allow the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to establish air force bases on our sacred territory. The two air force bases that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization plans to establish in Cameroon not only violate the will of the Cameroonian people, but also violate the will of the African people. We absolutely do not allow the colonialists to send planes from our territory to suppress the national independence movements in various African countries!" Mr. Ouandi's words expressed the true will of the Cameroonian people. Mr. Ouandi became more and more excited. During our interview, he repeatedly thanked the Chinese people for their support of the Cameroonian people's just struggle. He especially mentioned the "Cameroon Day" held by the Chinese people in February this year. He said: "The great Chinese people have always extended a helping hand to the oppressed African people. The imperialists' attempt to create a gap between the African people and the Chinese people is futile. In the arduous struggle, the African people have clearly recognized who their friends are and who their enemies are." Mr. Ouandi also told us that this was his third visit to China. The first time was in 1954, when he came to Beijing to attend the Beijing meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council, when he stayed in China for three weeks. The second time was in 1958, when he was invited by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to visit China for a month. He said: "Every time I come to China, it's like being at home. I really hate to leave it!"
    Before leaving, Mr. Ouandi excitedly waved his fist and said in a firm and excited tone: "The cause we are engaged in is a just cause. The Chinese people support us, and peace-loving people all over the world support us. We will surely win the final victory!"

    喀麦隆在继续战斗
    ——访喀麦隆人民联盟副主席乌安迪
    帝国主义者在联合国说，喀麦隆人民已经离开了喀麦隆人民联盟。喀麦隆的局势真的像帝国主义者所描绘的那样平静吗？记者最近在北京访问了喀麦隆人民联盟副主席乌安迪先生，他告诉我们，事实恰恰与帝国主义者的谎言相反，喀麦隆人民正在喀麦隆人民联盟的领导下继续进行着战斗。
    乌安迪先生告诉我们，在他来到北京的第二天——7月1日，曾收到了喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃博士从开罗打给他的一份电报。拆开电报一看，原来是喀麦隆爱国者袭击法国殖民主义者的捷报。
    6月27日晚间，三十名喀麦隆爱国者在法国殖民者占领的杜阿拉海港城市连续发动了三次突然袭击，他们用手提机关枪和其他武器，打死了法国殖民者及其走狗六名，其中有一名法国军官和一名法国宪兵；重伤二十五名，其中有十名是法国殖民主义者。
    事情发生以后，法国殖民当局立即派出军队协助警察“维持秩序”，杜阿拉全市实行宵禁，直到第二天，局势还相当紧张，在街头和欧洲人住宅区，依然有大批殖民军队持枪巡逻。
    谈起这份电报，乌安迪先生是那样地充满了胜利的喜悦。他说：“为了独立和自由，喀麦隆人民就是这样地在继续战斗着。”
    乌安迪先生远在他作小学教员的年代里，就参加了喀麦隆人民的爱国斗争。1948年喀麦隆全国最大的政治组织——喀麦隆人民联盟成立的时候，他加入了这个联盟，并且在1952年当选为这个联盟的副主席。十多年来，他一直是争取喀麦隆民族独立斗争的一位坚强战士。
    在我们访问的一开始，乌安迪先生就愤愤地谈起了联合国大会关于喀麦隆问题的决议。他说，大家知道，联合国大会今年3月在美英法操纵下通过的这个决议，它只是在形式上宣布法属喀麦隆在1960年1月1日“独立”，而没有提到被英国占领下的那一部分喀麦隆的前途，并且在决议中根本没有规定独立前在喀麦隆举行普选，使喀麦隆获得真正的独立。
      “这使喀麦隆人民再一次认识到：独立不能依靠联合国的赐予，独立要用斗争去争取。因此，喀麦隆人民决定继续战斗下去，直到获得真正的独立为止！”乌安迪先生坚定地说。
    虽然殖民主义者像狐狸般的许下愿，同意喀麦隆在1960年1月1日“独立”。但是，殖民主义者怎样来实现他们的诺言呢？乌安迪先生告诉我们，殖民主义者为了在喀麦隆“独立”以后永远维持他们在那里的殖民统治，继续吞噬喀麦隆人民的血汗，他们仍然施展种种法西斯的血腥手段，更加残酷地镇压喀麦隆人民。于是，在喀麦隆的神圣土地上，更多的触目惊心的事情发生了。殖民主义者和他的走狗们对善良人民施行的酷刑达到了灭绝人性、令人发指的地步。
    在萨纳加地方，法国殖民主义者有一次逮捕了许多喀麦隆爱国者，他们要狠心处死这些爱国者，他们就在野地里挖了许多一人深的土坑，以后让这些爱国者站在坑里，又驱使别人填土掩埋，直到土埋至脖颈为止，只让受害者的头露在外边。活活窒息死。在另外一个地方还发生了这样的事情，殖民主义者在地上挖了大坑，把一批爱国者赶到坑里，然后用铁皮把坑盖严，再在铁皮上生起火来。铁皮烧得通红，爱国者们就这样惨死在坑里。殖民主义者以杀人为乐，他们逮捕了爱国者，剥光爱国者的衣服，用刀把脖子里的肉割掉一圈，接着把胸前的肉割掉，鲜血随之染红了脖颈和前胸。这时候，殖民主义者残忍地指着活受熬煎的爱国者说，“这是戴共产主义的红领带。”至于殖民主义者轮奸妇女、剖开孕妇的肚子，把爱国者装进麻袋投入河里的事情，更是屡见不鲜。
    在控诉殖民主义者暴行的时候，乌安迪先生满怀着对殖民主义者的无比仇恨。他激愤地说：“那些血淋淋的暴行我简直不忍在这里重提它。”
    “暴力必须用暴力去对付，殖民主义者越残暴，人民反抗他们的斗争越发展。”乌安迪先生接着向我们介绍了喀麦隆人民进行英勇斗争的情况。他说，喀麦隆人民并没有因此而吓倒，血的教训使喀麦隆人民深深懂得，独立和自由绝不能依靠殖民主义者赐予，而是需要坚决的斗争，喀麦隆的全民都在继续战斗着。更多的热血滔滔的青年挺身奔向森林区，加入游击队，老年人用他晚年的气力，为游击队带路和运送给养，妇女们也出奇地担负了许多侦察工作。游击队在人民的支持下，常常冲出遮天蔽日的森林地带，用种种方法打击敌人，获得胜利。
    乌安迪先生给我们讲了两个战斗故事：
    巴米利克是一个有许多爱国者活动的地区，这使殖民军队和反动派十分恼火。一天，十名全副武装的法国士兵坐着卡车来到这里，横冲直闯乱抓人，结果有五十名爱国者被抓着押上卡车，殖民野兽们满以为可以凯旋回去了。他们万没有料到这里的妇女们也是有觉悟的爱国者。一群妇女们决心要营救被抓去的人，她们心生一计，相互一串通，不等敌人的汽车开出，她们结伙抢先奔出村，来到一条河沟附近，这条河上用树枝树干搭有便桥，是汽车必经之地，她们一齐动手把便桥破坏了。一会儿，载着爱国者的卡车开来了，敌兵见不能通行，就下车来整修，妇女们趁这个机会和敌兵打闹，河边上一时乱作一团，最后几个妇女被捕了，但是车上的五十名爱国者就在这个时候跳下车，顺利潜入山林草丛。更大的斗争力量保存下来了，新的战斗继续在巴米利克地区进行着。
    在萨纳加海滨区还有这样一个游击队出奇制胜的故事：萨纳加的游击队老早计划要给殖民军队吃一个大教训，但是他们没有枪，没有好机会下手。有一天游击队员探知一群殖民军队出来巡逻，他们看到这正是送到口边的“食物”，于是定了一个“巧计擒敌”计，决心收拾掉它，武装自己。在敌兵行走的路上，一群女游击队员装成普通农妇模样，迎面向敌兵走去。敌兵见是妇女，没有把她们看在眼里，等走近时，妇女们一齐扑上去，把事先准备好的辣椒面，披头盖脑地朝敌兵的脸撒去，辣椒面钻到敌兵的眼里、鼻子里，刺得他们眼泪横流，敌兵想睁眼看看也不可能，更是慌作一团。这时埋伏在路边草丛里的游击队员，猛虎扑食般地跳了出来，等敌兵清醒过来时，他们才知道枪被游击队员缴去了，他们自己也做了俘虏。
    殖民主义者的经济掠夺，使喀麦隆的经济情况愈来愈坏，到处是失业和贫困。据统计，在喀麦隆的经济首都杜阿拉的十五万人口中，就有一万七千多人失业，占有劳力居民的36.4％。人民不愿意逆来顺受，争取独立自由的斗争遍布田野和工厂、乡村和城市。行动一致的罢工斗争时常发生。在喀麦隆农业中心蒙戈的香蕉种植工人在6月间连续举行了几星期的大罢工，杜阿拉的银行职员、雅温得的水电工人和丰班的农业工人都举行了大罢工。就连法国殖民主义者也不得不承认，这些罢工事件超出了经济的范围而带有政治色彩了。布满全国的爱国游击战争和时起的罢工事件，组成了喀麦隆人民争取独立斗争的一股不可抗拒的怒潮。
    乌安迪先生说：“喀麦隆人民为民族独立而战斗，也为世界和平而战斗，我们绝对不允许北大西洋公约组织在我们神圣的国土上建立空军基地。北大西洋公约组织计划在喀麦隆建立的两个空军基地不仅违反喀麦隆人民的意志，而且也违反非洲人民的意志。我们绝对不允许殖民主义者从我们国土上派出飞机去镇压非洲各国的民族独立运动！”乌安迪先生的这些话表达了喀麦隆人民的真正意志。乌安迪先生越说越兴奋。在我们访问的过程中，他一再感谢中国人民对喀麦隆人民正义斗争的支持，他特别提到今年2月间中国人民举行“喀麦隆日”的事情。他说：“伟大的中国人民对被压迫的非洲人民一向伸出援助的手。帝国主义者想在非洲人民和中国人民间制造隔阂是无济于事的，非洲人民在艰苦的斗争中清楚地认识了谁是他们的朋友，谁是他们的敌人。”乌安迪先生又告诉我们，他这是第三次来中国，第一次是在1954年，他前来北京出席世界民主青年联盟理事会北京会议，那时他在中国逗留了三个星期；第二次是1958年应外交学会的邀请到中国作了一个月客。他说：“每一次来中国，都像到了自己家里一样，真舍不得离开它！”
    临别时，乌安迪先生激动得挥动拳头，用坚定而兴奋的语调说：“我们从事的事业是正义的事业，中国人民支持我们，全世界爱好和平的人民支持我们，我们一定会得到最后胜利！”
