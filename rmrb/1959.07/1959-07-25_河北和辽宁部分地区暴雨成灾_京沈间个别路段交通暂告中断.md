Xinhua News Agency, July 24th: Heavy rains fell continuously in northern Hebei and the Jinzhou area of Liaoning on the 21st and 22nd. Two sections of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, one inside and one outside Shanhaiguan, were damaged by floods. Railway traffic from Beijiadian in Hebei to Suizhong County in Liaoning has been temporarily interrupted since the morning of the 22nd. The heavy rain caused a sharp rise in the water level of some rivers in the above-mentioned two areas, and some villages and towns were flooded. At present, railway workers, with the assistance of local people, are working day and night to repair the damaged bridges and roadbeds, and the people in the flooded villages and towns have been rescued from danger.

Since the morning of the 21st, heavy rainstorms have occurred in areas such as the Jiyun River and the lower reaches of the Luan River in northern Hebei Province. The daily rainfall at Xinji Station on the Jiyun River reached 543.3 millimeters, and the daily rainfall at Panjiakou Station on the Luan River reached 405.4 millimeters. Due to the rapid rain and high water, mountain torrents broke out, and the bridge abutments, piers, or bridgehead roadbeds of five bridges on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway between Beijiadian and Shanhaiguan were damaged by mountain torrents, and about one kilometer of roadbed between Longjiaying and Shanhaiguan was intermittently damaged.

Heavy rains also fell continuously in Liaoning Province on the 21st and 22nd. The center of the heavy rain in the Jinzhou area was in the Liugu River basin. Due to heavy rainstorms upstream and downstream, and the breach of four small reservoirs upstream, the flow of the Liugu River surged from 19 cubic meters per second to more than 9,000 cubic meters per second. On the morning of the 22nd, the dike at Xiaozhai in Suizhong County breached. On the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, the bridge abutments, piers, or bridgehead roadbeds of four bridges between Suizhong and Shanhaiguan were damaged, and about one kilometer of roadbed between Qianwei and Gaoling was intermittently damaged.

After the railway was interrupted, the railway department and local leading organs immediately organized forces to rush repairs. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Jinzhou also sent a force to assist.

At 3:00 on the 23rd, the flood peak of the Liugu River had entered the sea, and the floodwaters in the flooded areas had all returned to the channel and began to recede towards the estuary. The water levels at the stations of the Jiyun River and the Luan River are continuing to fall.

    河北和辽宁部分地区暴雨成灾
    京沈间个别路段交通暂告中断
    据新华社24日讯　河北北部、辽宁锦州地区二十一、二两日连降暴雨，京沈间铁路山海关内外各有一段被洪水冲坏，从22日晨起由河北卑家店到辽宁绥中县的铁路交通暂时中断。这次暴雨使上述两地区部分河流水势猛涨，有些村屯被淹成灾。现在，铁道职工在当地群众的协助下正在日夜抢修被冲坏的桥梁和路基，被淹村屯的群众已经抢救出险。
    从21日晨起，河北省北部蓟运河、滦河下游等地区都下了大暴雨。蓟运河辛集站日雨量大到五四三点三毫米，滦河潘家口站日雨量大到四○五点四毫米。由于雨急水大，山洪爆发，京沈间铁路从卑家店到山海关间有五座桥的桥台、桥墩或桥头路基被山洪冲损，龙家营到山海关间有一公里左右的路基被断续冲坏。
    辽宁全省21、22日也连降大雨，锦州地区暴雨中心在六股河流域。由于上下游都降大暴雨，加以上游有四座小水库决口，六股河流量由十九秒立方米骤涨到九千多秒立方米，22日晨在绥中县的小寨漫堤决口。京沈间铁路从绥中到山海关间有四座桥的桥台、桥墩或桥头路基被冲损，前卫到高岭有一公里左右的路基被断续冲坏。
    铁路中断后，铁道部门和地方领导机关，立即组织力量抢修。人民解放军驻锦州部队也派出一支力量协助。
    23日三时，六股河的洪峰已经入海，受淹地区的洪水已经全部归槽，开始向海口退去。蓟运河、滦河各站水位正继续回落。
