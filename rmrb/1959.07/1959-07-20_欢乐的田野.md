    Joyful Fields
    Lu San
    Departing by bus from Beiliu County, Guangxi, and traveling south along the Beibao Road for eight li, then ascending the 200-meter-high Huangni Ridge, a captivating picture unfolds before one's eyes: the 860-plus mu of early rice belonging to the Wanbei Brigade of the Songhua Commune, shining like pure gold. A gentle breeze stirs, creating rolling waves of rice. Young women are harvesting in the fields, their silver sickles flashing, laughter echoing. What a vibrant field!
    
    "Year of Striving"
    The Wanbei Brigade was originally a place with poor soil and little water, historically a grain-deficient team. Last year, the entire brigade harvested only 80,000 jin of early rice, and by the time the late rice seedlings were planted, they had to reach out in all directions to buy grain. Members of other teams would say, "Wanbei has surplus grain, a happy life lasting ten thousand years; Wanbei doesn't lack grain, the moon can be used as the sun."

    Now, the people here feel increasingly happy as they cut the rice. The words from the bottom of their hearts pour out like water from a breached dam. Brigade leader Luo Zhaoqi, pointing his fingers, says to everyone he meets: "Work hard, work hard, we truly have results! Just over 230 mu harvested, and already more than 81,000 jin of grain collected, surpassing last year's yield for the entire season. This crop, if we don't harvest over 300,000 jin, it'll be because we didn't strive hard enough."

    Luo Zhangwen, a 69-year-old experienced farmer, also says: "Emperors have come and gone, I've farmed for a lifetime, and I've never seen such good rice. Such a year is all thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" Middle-aged commune members say, "Although the overall situation for a bumper harvest is set, we must intensify our efforts in careful harvesting and threshing." The young women and men are saying: "Buddha vies for a stick of incense, people strive for a breath of air. This year, we must have a 'Year of Striving'."

    From Shaking Heads to Nodding
    The First Production Team is harvesting several mu of dwarf rice on Miaomen Ridge. When the commune members saw the short rice seedlings topped with such long, large, and full ears, they all laughed and said:
    "Pick a few ears and show them to Uncle Cai Renting!"

    What's the story behind this? It turns out that Cai Renting is an experienced farmer who has lived through more than sixty years and accumulated the wisdom that "nothing is true unless you do it yourself." This spring, the brigade cadres called for the promotion of the dwarf rice variety. He didn't even look at it, shaking his head and saying: "No good, Wanbei has never grown it before." Ten days after the seedlings were planted, he saw that they weren't growing tall and weren't turning green quickly, so he stomped his feet by the field, shaking his head and saying: "Bad news! Bad news!" Later, the rice seedlings suffered from rice blast disease, with yellow spots on the leaves. He said even louder: "If you don't believe the old folks, you'll suffer before your eyes." But the team members applied thirty jin of lime and seventy jin of plant ash to each mu of rice paddy. After a few days, the rice changed, and most of the leaves turned green. Then they continuously applied fertilizer five times, and it grew into what it is now. Cai Sanbo no longer shook his head; he held a handful of rice ears, nodding repeatedly and saying:
    "Unbelievable, unbelievable, the rice is short but the grain is abundant. We must plant more dwarf rice next year."

    "One-Stop Service"
    The heavy rain and strong wind made the rice fields like paste. This presented a difficult problem for the young women harvesting the rice. Once the cut rice ears touched the ground, both the ears and grains would stick in the mud. Someone calculated that more than thirty jin of grain per mu would be lost to the mud.
    "This won't do, we can't let this continue, a bumper yield must be a bumper harvest." People said in unison. But how to solve this problem? The young women were thinking, the young men were thinking, and the cadres went to consult with the old farmers. With more people, more ideas, and broader thinking, a solution was found. Party Branch Secretary Luo Guanfu gathered everyone's opinions: place a straw mat inside a rectangular wooden frame to create a "rice bed," move it to where the rice is being cut, and place all the cut rice on the "rice bed." If any ripe grains fall, they will all fall on the straw mat, and not a single grain will be lost. Once full, push the "rice bed" to the edge of the field, then put the rice into baskets bundle by bundle and carry it back to the threshing ground. In this way, from cutting to carrying, no land is occupied, avoiding waste.

    Now, this advanced harvesting method is being widely promoted throughout the brigade, and people have given it a name, calling it "One-Stop Service."

          Threshing Again and Again
    The news that the young women were harvesting carefully and meticulously quickly spread to all five threshing grounds in the brigade. The young men at the Fourth Threshing Ground took the lead, proposing to challenge the young women with "three threshings" – threshing quickly, threshing hard, and threshing cleanly.

    "Even the most skilled person makes mistakes, and even the best horse stumbles." One dark and windy night, the Fourth Threshing Ground, due to insufficient lighting, missed a large pile of rice that hadn't been re-threshed. This oversight was discovered by ploughman Luo Shikun. He quietly re-threshed a small pile, yielding two jin of grain. He ran as fast as he could, shouting loudly: "Come and see! The threshing ground competing with the young women has missed grains!" When the young men ran out to see, their faces turned as red as Guan Yu's, and they angrily rushed onto the threshing ground, re-threshing fiercely. Therefore, they set a method of "threshing again and again," first three times, then three times, then three times again, to prevent any possible oversights.

      To Have a Steady Flow of Resources
    Party Branch Secretary Luo Guanfu had been suffering from headaches for several days, but he insisted on participating in the rush harvest, and at night he often hunched over under the kerosene lamp, calculating late into the night. He was calculating the brigade's financial accounts: the team has already harvested over 230 mu of early rice, collecting more than 81,000 jin of grain; the entire brigade has over 860 mu of early rice, which can yield more than 330,000 jin of grain. First, pay 55,000 jin of public grain, leave 25,000 jin for seeds, leave 10,000 jin for feed, leave 138,000 jin for rations, sell 60,000 jin of surplus grain, and still have more than 40,000 jin of grain left for storage, to prevent any unforeseen circumstances. "We must not forget the tight days of the past! With a bumper harvest, we must be even more careful about saving." He said to himself.

    Chen Bayun, an experienced farmer from the First Production Team, also had his own work to do. He was old, experienced, and knowledgeable. At the start of the harvest, he announced to his wife and children: "We! Must understand the importance of a steady flow of resources. This crop, our family should get over 1,200 jin of grain. Now, during the busy season, we eat a little better. After a while, when the farming is less busy, we should plan to save some grain. Feed the more than twenty chickens and ducks at home well, buy two more pigs to raise in August, and raise six more geese in September. With pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese, we will have a long-term plan."

    欢乐的田野
    卢三
    从广西北流县乘车出发，沿北宝路往南走八里，再登上二百公尺高的黄泥岭，一幅诱人的图画呈现在人们眼前：松花公社弯背大队方圆八百六十多亩早稻，黄得像纯金闪闪发亮，微风拂过，稻浪滚滚，姑娘们正在田野里抢收，银镰挥舞，笑声萦绕，这是一个多么有生气的田野呀！
      “争气年”
    弯背大队，原是个地瘠水少的地方，历来都是缺粮队。去年，早稻全队只收八万斤，吃到插下晚稻秧，就得向四面八方伸手买粮了。别队的社员都说：“弯背有余粮，幸福生活万年长；弯背不缺粮，月亮也能当太阳。”
    如今，这里的人们越割禾心堂越开。人们的心底话，像决口的水倾泻出来。大队长罗昭琦见人就点着手指头说：“干呀，干呀，硬是有了结果！刚割二百三十多亩，就收八万一千多斤谷子，顶上去年一季的产量。这一造呀，不收它三十多万斤，就算我们不争气。”
    六十九岁的老耕家罗章文也说：“皇帝经过几个，耕田耕了一世，就没见过这么好的禾。这样的年景呀，都是托共产党、毛主席的福！”中年社员们说：“丰产大局虽定，细收细打还要加劲。”姑娘、小伙子们说的是：“佛争一柱香，人争一口气。今年呀，一定要来个
  ‘争气年’。”
    从摇头到点头
    第一生产队正在收刈庙门垌的几亩矮籽占。社员们看到矮矮的禾苗顶上竟突出那又长、又大、又饱满的穗子，都七嘴八舌地笑着说：
  “摘下几穗，叫蔡任圢三伯看看！”
    这话从何说起？事情原来是这样！蔡任圢是经历六十多个寒暑的老耕家，积下一条“不亲手做过不为真”的经验。今年春，大队干部号召推广矮籽占良种。他连看也不看，就摇着头说：“不行，弯背这一带从没种过。”秧苗插下十多天了，他看到长的不高，转青又不快，在田边就顿足摇头地说：“坏事！坏事！”后来禾苗患了稻热病，禾叶黄斑点点。他更大声说：“不信老人言，吃亏在眼前。”可是队员们在每亩稻田里下了三十斤石灰、七十斤草木灰，几天后禾变了，叶子大部分绿油油的；接着又连续追肥五次，就长成现在这个样子。蔡三伯不再摇头了，他拿着一把谷穗连连点头说：
  “看不出，看不出，禾矮竟然谷多，明年要多种矮籽占了。”
      “一条龙”
    雨大、风大，稻田像浆糊一样。这就给割禾的姑娘们出了一道难题。割下的禾穗一沾着地，就连穗带谷粘在泥浆里。有人计算了一下，每亩被泥浆粘走的谷要有三十斤以上。
      “这还了得，不能这样下去，丰产一定要丰收。”人们异口同声的说。但怎样解答这道难题呢？姑娘们在想，小伙子们在想，干部们分头找老农商量。人多话多，思路也广，办法也就找出来了。党支书罗官福集中大家的意见：在一个长方形木架子中，放上一张草席做个“禾床”，割到那里搬到那里，割下的禾全部放在“禾床”上；万一熟透的谷子掉下来，全掉在草席上，一粒也丢不了。放满了，就把“禾床”推到田边，再把禾一捆一捆的放到谷箩里，挑回打谷场。这样，从割到挑全不占地，避免了浪费。
    现在，这个先进的收割方法在全大队普遍推行，人们给它起了个名字，叫“一条龙”。
          再三打
    姑娘们快收细收的消息，迅速地传遍了全大队五个打谷场。第四打谷场的小伙子们一马当先，提出用打得快，打得重，打得净的“三打”来向姑娘们应战。
    “人有失手，马有落蹄”。在一个天黑风高的夜晚，第四打谷场因灯光不足，漏掉一大堆禾没复打。这个漏洞，恰巧给犁耙手罗世昆发现。他悄悄地复打一小堆，得谷两斤。他就三步并作两步，边跑边高声喊：“来看呀！要和姑娘们竞赛的打谷场漏打谷粒啦！”小伙子们跑出来一看，一个个脸红得都像“关云长”一样，气鼓鼓地冲上了打谷场，狠狠地重复再打。于是，他们又定下先三遍、再三遍、后三遍的“再三打”的办法，来提防万一。
      要细水长流
    党支书罗官福几天来闹着头痛，也坚持参加抢割，晚上还经常伏在煤油灯下盘算到深夜。他算的是这个大队的家底账：队里早稻已割二百三十多亩，收谷八万一千多斤；全队八百六十多亩早稻，可割谷三十三万多斤。先交公粮五万五，留下种子二万五，留下饲料一万，留下口粮十三万八千，卖六万斤余粮，还能剩下四万多斤谷子留作贮备，以防万一。“过去的紧日子不能忘记！丰收了更加注意节约。”他自言自语地说。
    第一生产队的老耕家陈拔云也有他的忙处。他人老阅历深，见识广，一开始收割，对老伴和孩子们就宣布：“我们呀！要懂得细水长流。这一造，我们一家人得预分一千二百多斤谷。现在农忙，吃得好一点。过些时，农闲了，就应当有计划地节省下一些粮食。把家中的二十多只鸡鸭喂好，8月再买两口猪来喂，9月份增养六只鹅。有猪、鸡、鸭、鹅，才是个长远打算啦。”
