Cherish Coke as You Cherish Grain, Save Coke to Produce More Iron
    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company Replaces Coke-Breaking Hammers, Significantly Reducing Coke Damage Rate

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 3rd. The Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company has replaced the large hammers with small hammers in the coke crushing yards and blast furnace raw material yards of all its coking plants, increasing the amount of qualified coke and greatly reducing coke powder. Workers said, "The coke damage rate has decreased by nearly half after changing the hammers."

Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company has taken many measures to save coke. In addition to blast furnace workers trying to reduce the coke ratio and coking plants trying to improve coke quality, they also closely focused on the stage from when coke leaves the kiln to when it enters the blast furnace. Throughout the company's crushing, transportation, and other departments, they launched a "Cherish Coke as You Cherish Grain" coke saving campaign. The specific methods are: 1. Improve coke crushing tools. All 1.5-kilogram rectangular hammers were replaced with 0.5-kilogram or smaller claw hammers and small pointed hammers. Coke is crushed along the grain, and processing coke on coke piles is prohibited. 2. Reduce the number of handling and stacking operations, and strengthen transportation management—vehicles do not crush coke, no coke is lost during transportation, and everyone is responsible for picking up coke. 3. Use coke rationally. Small coke of 15 to 30 mm cannot be used in blast furnaces larger than 72 cubic meters, and is screened and used in small blast furnaces.

The Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company currently uses indigenous coke for iron smelting. Due to its low strength, indigenous coke cannot withstand heavy hammering, heavy throwing, and abrasion. For every ton of coke produced from the kiln, only 650 to 700 kilograms reach the furnace after being loaded and unloaded from vehicles, stacked, crushed, put into storage bins, and passed through vibrating screens, with a loss rate of about 30% (including reasonable and unreasonable losses). Crushing losses account for about 20% to 25%, transportation losses account for about 5%, and screening losses account for about 5%. Taking only the three coking plants of this company, which produce 90,000 tons of coke per month, and calculating the loss of 30% before entering the blast furnace, more than 27,000 tons of raw coke are lost.

The loss of coke from the time it leaves the kiln to the time it enters the blast furnace cannot be completely avoided, but if the loss rate is reduced from 30% to 20%, the entire company can save 12,000 tons of coke per month. Company leaders educated the employees by calculating detailed accounts and called on everyone to truly cherish finished coke.

After Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company proposed specific methods for saving coke, all rectangular hammers for crushing coke in the company were replaced with small pointed hammers and claw hammers within four or five days, significantly reducing the coke damage rate. From June 1st to 9th, the damage rate of Coking Plant No. 1 decreased from the original 19% to 12%, saving more than 400 tons of coke in nine days. In the past, large hammers were used to crush coke in the blast furnace raw material yard. One hammer strike turned a lot of coke into "tofu dregs"; after switching to small hammers, coke powder was reduced by one-third. (Yu Feng) (Attached Picture)

### 爱焦如爱粮　省焦多炼铁  马钢更换碎焦铁锤，焦炭破损率显著降低

    爱焦如爱粮　省焦多炼铁
    马钢更换碎焦铁锤，焦炭破损率显著降低
    本报合肥3日电　马鞍山钢铁公司各个焦化厂的破碎场和高炉原料场的碎焦工具由大锤换成小锤，合格焦增多，焦粉大大减少。工人们说：“铁锤一换，焦炭破损率降低近一半。”
    马鞍山钢铁公司在节约焦炭方面采取了许多措施，除高炉工人想法降低焦比，焦化厂想法提高焦炭质量以外，他们还紧紧抓住焦炭出窑后到入高炉前这一段，在全公司破碎、运输等方面的职工中，掀起了一个“爱焦如爱粮”的节约焦炭运动。具体办法是：一、改进碎焦工具。把一公斤半的长方锤一律改为半公斤以下的羊角锤和小尖锤，碎焦时按焦炭上的锢纹破碎，并且禁止在焦堆上加工焦炭。二、减少搬运转堆次数，加强运输管理——车辆不压焦炭，运输途中不遗失焦炭，人人有责拾拣焦炭。三、合理使用焦炭。十五到三十公厘的小焦，七十二立方公尺以上的高炉不能用，筛选后供小高炉用。
    马鞍山钢铁公司现在炼铁使用的是土焦。土焦由于强度低，经不起重捶、重甩和摩损。出窑一吨焦，上下车、转堆、破碎、下储矿槽、经震动筛，到入炉时只有六百五十到七百公斤，损耗率达30％左右
  （其中包括合理与不合理的损耗）。其中破碎损耗约占20％到25％，途中运输损耗约5％，筛选损耗约5％。只拿这个公司三个焦化厂每月生产九万吨焦，入高炉前的损耗为30％计算，就损失二万七千多吨原焦。
    焦炭从出窑到入高炉这一段的损耗是不能完全避免的，但是如果把损耗率从30％降低到20％，全公司一个月就可以节约焦炭一万二千吨。公司领导人员用算细账的办法向职工进行了教育，号召大家切实爱护成品焦。
    马鞍山钢铁公司提出节约焦炭的具体办法以后，四五天内全公司碎焦的长方锤一律改为小尖锤和羊角锤，焦炭破损率显著降低。6月1日到9日，焦化一厂破损率从原来的19％下降到12％，九天内节约焦炭四百多吨。高炉原料场过去用大锤碎焦，一锤下去，许多焦变成了豆腐渣；改用小锤以后，焦炭粉减少了三分之一。　（于风）（附图片）
