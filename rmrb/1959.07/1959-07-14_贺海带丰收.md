Congratulating the Seaweed Harvest
By Our Correspondent

Midsummer is the best season for harvesting seaweed. Good news keeps pouring in: our coastal regions are having a bumper seaweed harvest this year. The national seaweed production is estimated to be around 45,000 tons (in the past, seaweed was calculated as fresh product; this year, it is calculated as dry product, with one ton of dry product equivalent to about six tons of fresh product), an increase of more than seven times compared to 1958. The seaweed farming area has expanded to over 80,000 mu, an increase of more than eight times compared to 1958. This is a huge leap forward and a great piece of good news in our aquatic production this year.

Seaweed is a popular non-staple food among the broad masses of the people in our country. Seaweed contains a relatively large amount of iodine, which can prevent goiter (commonly known as "big neck disease"), and is therefore especially popular among people in remote mountainous areas where this disease is more prevalent. Seaweed has high economic value. It can not only be eaten but also has wide applications in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. One ton of seaweed is worth about seven and a half tons of yellow croaker. Therefore, a bumper seaweed harvest will greatly increase the wealth of the people's communes and increase the income of their members. At the same time, it will save the country foreign exchange by reducing imports.

Seaweed farming is still an emerging production enterprise in our country. Before liberation, it was only produced in Lushun and Dalian. Later, it was transplanted to Yantai, but the output was very low. After liberation, successful trials were conducted in Qingdao, but the national output was still very small, only a few hundred tons. By 1957, the national output had increased to more than 12,000 tons (fresh product), but it still fell far short of meeting the needs of the broad masses of the people, and most of the seaweed still relied on imports from abroad. This year's bumper seaweed harvest will change this situation.

The seaweed harvest fully demonstrates the superiority of our socialist system and the correctness of the aquatic production policy of relying on the masses and combining farming and fishing. Seaweed farming is a relatively complex production process that requires suitable water temperature, fertile water quality, and sufficient light. It also requires materials such as bamboo and coir ropes, so the cost is relatively high. For several years, farming production has been limited to a few state-owned farms. In the past two years, encouraged by the aquatic production policy of relying on the masses and combining farming and fishing, the broad masses of fishermen, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, visited and learned, and boldly experimented with farming, finally succeeding. Since then, seaweed has stepped out of the gates of the farms. The broad masses have farmed seaweed on a large scale, quickly mastered production techniques, and widely used substitutes, replacing coir ropes with oil grass ropes and sweet potato stalks, and replacing moso bamboo with gourd heads, and building their own fertilizer tanks, and so on. In this way, the cost has also decreased.

The wisdom of the fishermen has been further brought into play under the leadership of the Party. Now, they are not only able to farm seaweed, but also to domesticate and transplant it. Seaweed has always been considered a plant that can only grow in the low-temperature areas of the north. In the past, some people even asserted that seaweed could not cross the Yangtze River to the south. Our fishermen were not intimidated by this precept. In order to rapidly increase production and develop seaweed production in a wider range, in the winter of 1956, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the fishermen, based on the characteristics of seaweed's rapid growth under suitable temperature and water fertility conditions, estimated that seaweed could reach commercial standards before the arrival of high water temperatures. Therefore, trial cultivation of seaweed southward was carried out in Lianyungang in Jiangsu, Shengsi Island and Gouqi Island in Zhejiang, and Lianjiang County and Xiaocheng Island in Fujian. After overcoming a series of difficulties and technical problems, except for Lianyungang, where the results were poor due to improper site selection, other places were successful. Seaweed grew well, reaching a length of more than three meters, meeting commercial standards. In 1958, 128 seaweed trial cultivation points were established across the country. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong all organized cadres to study in Qingdao and Dalian, and held training classes to train technical cadres. In many areas, the Party committee secretaries took the lead in leading seaweed production. In many areas of Fujian, the enthusiasm of the masses was even higher, truly "every family farms seaweed, every household talks about seaweed." Seaweed farming production has expanded from state-owned farms to the masses, from points to areas, from the cold northern regions to the subtropical south, and farming production has been universally carried out. The seaweed farming industry has thus developed on a large scale.

Under the care and leadership of the Party and the government for seaweed production, aquatic scientific research workers combined with the masses to create an artificial low-temperature seedling cultivation method for seaweed, providing a source of large quantities of seedlings needed for seaweed production. Many areas in the south have been able to cultivate seedlings on their own, overcoming the difficulty of long-distance transportation of seedlings from the north. In terms of farming methods, a parallel farming method has been created, changing the past vertical farming method and increasing the yield per unit area.

In the process of seaweed production, a large number of technical forces have been trained. There are currently more than 40,000 people farming seaweed along the coast, which is a valuable technical team. At the same time, much experience has been accumulated in production, providing conditions for developing seaweed farming production on a larger scale in the future.

We warmly celebrate this year's seaweed harvest. It not only writes a new page in the history of seaweed farming production in our country, but also fully proves that our marine aquaculture industry has great potential. Of course, it should also be pointed out that because seaweed farming is still an emerging production enterprise, the masses have not been producing for a long time, and the development of production has been unusually rapid, so there are still many problems and difficulties in terms of production technology, business management, and material use. But these are problems and difficulties in the process of advancement. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and by resolutely relying on the masses, these problems can be solved and the difficulties can be overcome. It is hoped that the aquatic departments and the people's communes that farm seaweed will further summarize experience, improve technology, and improve operating methods on the existing basis, and prepare to produce more and better seaweed in the future to further meet the needs of the country and the people.

    贺海带丰收
    本报评论员
    盛夏，正是海带收割的大好季节。捷报纷纷传来，我国沿海地区今年海带大丰收。全国海带产量约在四万五千吨左右（过去海带按鲜品计算，今年一律改干品计算，一吨干品约等于六吨鲜品），较1958年将增产七倍多。海带养殖面积扩大到八万多亩，较1958年增加八倍多。这是一个特大的跃进，是今年我国水产生产中的一个大喜讯。
    海带是我国广大人民喜爱的副食品。海带内含有较多的碘质，可以防治甲状腺肿（俗称大脖子病），因此最受患此病较多的边远山区人民的欢迎。海带的经济价值很高，它不仅可供食用，而且在医药业、化学工业上都有广泛的用途。一吨海带的价值约等于七吨半黄花鱼。因此，海带的丰收将为人民公社增加大量财富，增加社员收入。同时，由于减少国外进口量，也为国家节省外汇。
    海带养殖生产在我国还是一项新兴的生产事业。解放前最初只有旅大一地生产，后来又移植在烟台，产量都很低。解放后在青岛试养成功，但全国产量仍很少，仅几百吨。到1957年，全国产量增到一万二千多吨（鲜品），仍远远不能满足广大人民的需要，海带大部分仍依靠国外进口。今年海带大丰收，将会改变这种情况。
    海带的丰收，充分地显示了我国社会主义制度的优越性和依靠群众、养捕并举的水产生产方针的正确性。海带养殖是一种比较复杂的生产，需要适宜的水温、肥沃的水质和足够的光照；还需竹子、棕绳等物资，因此成本也较高。几年来养殖生产一直停留在几个国营养殖场。近两年来，在依靠群众、养捕并举的水产生产方针鼓舞下，广大渔民群众在党委统一领导下，参观学习，大胆试养，终于成功。从此，海带走出了养殖场的大门。广大群众大规模地养殖海带，很快地掌握了生产技术，并且广泛使用代用品，以油草绳、地瓜茎代替棕绳，以葫芦头代替毛竹，自烧施肥罐等等。这样，成本也下降了。
    渔民群众的智慧，在党的领导下进一步发挥出来。现在，他们不仅能够养殖海带，而且还能把海带加以驯化和移植。海带原来一直被认为是一种只能在北方低水温区域成长的植物；过去有些人还曾断言：海带不能过长江以南。我国渔民并没有被这个戒律所吓倒，为了迅速地增加产量，并使海带生产在更广大的范围内发展起来，1956年冬，在党和政府领导下，渔民群众根据海带在适宜的温度和水肥条件下成长快的特点，估计在高水温来临之前，海带可以达到商品标准；因此，在江苏连云港，浙江嵊泗岛和枸杞岛，福建连江县和小埕岛进行了海带南移试养。在克服一系列困难和技术问题之后，除连云港因选择地点不当而成绩不良以外，其他地方都成功了。海带成长良好，长度达三米以上，符合商品标准。1958年全国建立了一百二十八处海带试养点，江苏、浙江、福建、广东都组织干部去青岛、旅大学习，开办训练班，培养技术干部。许多地区都由党委书记挂帅领导海带生产。在福建许多地区，群众热情更高，真是“家家养海带，户户谈海带”。海带养殖生产由国营养殖场到群众，由点到面，由寒冷的北方地区到亚热带的南方，普遍地开展了养殖生产。海带养殖事业就这样大规模地发展起来了。
    在党和政府对海带生产的关怀和领导下，水产科学研究工作者和群众相结合，创造了海带人工低温育苗的方法，为海带生产需要的大量苗种提供来源。南方许多地区已经能够自行育苗，克服了从北方长途运输幼苗的困难。在养殖方法上，创造了平行养殖法，改变了过去的垂直养殖法，提高了单位水面产量。
    在海带的生产过程中，培养了大批技术力量。沿海现有四万多人养殖海带，这是一支可贵的技术队伍。同时，在生产中还积累了许多经验，为今后更大规模地发展海带养殖生产提供了条件。
    我们热烈地庆祝今年海带的丰收。它不仅为我国海带养殖生产史写下新的一页，而且充分证明我国的海水养殖事业是大有可为的。当然，还应该指出，由于海带养殖还是一项新兴的生产事业，群众生产的时间不长，而且生产的发展又异常迅速，因此在生产技术、经营管理、物资使用等等方面，还有许多问题和困难。但这是前进中的问题和困难。我们相信，在党的领导下，坚决依靠群众，这些问题都是可以解决的，困难都是可以克服的。希望水产部门和养殖海带的人民公社在现有基础上进一步总结经验，提高技术，改进作业方法，准备今后生产出更多更好的海带，进一步满足国家和人民的需要。
