Do a Good Job of Political and Ideological Work Anytime, Anywhere
The Fifty Li Pu Party Branch Achieves Good Results with Flexible and Diverse Methods

(Our Dispatch) The Fifty Li Pu Branch of the Chinese Communist Party's Jie Kou Commune in Tianshui City, Gansu Province, consistently pays attention to conducting systematic political and ideological education work for party members and commune members, thereby ensuring that all tasks are carried out very well.

First, this branch has consistently incorporated socialist and communist education into every movement. During the cooperativization period, they educated commune members on the path of collective prosperity through organization, overcoming the mindset of complacency that some masses developed after their living standards rose following the land reform, and instilling in them a desire to organize. After cooperativization, some commune members developed capitalist ideas, believing that participating in the cooperative was not free. The Party branch frequently conducted education for party members and the masses through Party classes and spare-time schools, explaining the superiority of cooperativization and the correct relationship between collective and individual interests, thus strengthening the commune members' determination to take the socialist road. After communization, the Party branch again educated commune members on the advantages of communization and the communist vision, further clarifying for party members and commune members the principles and policies for building socialism in the countryside and the specific path towards communism.

In addition to regularly conducting systematic socialist education for party members and commune members, the Party branch pays special attention to understanding and studying the ideological trends of the masses during each task, and conducting ideological education work. No matter how urgent the task, the branch always insists on using facts and experiences from their own locality or other places to explain to party members and commune members why they should do it and how they should do it, so that the demands of the leadership are transformed into the conscious actions of the masses. They regard explaining the significance of completing tasks and the methods for completing tasks as part of ideological work, and never act rashly or simplistically. This working method of theirs, on the surface, seems to make the work slower, but once the theory is grasped by the masses, it becomes a huge material force. When the masses truly understand the reasoning behind it, they will unleash infinite potential on a voluntary and conscious basis. Therefore, in reality, the tasks are not completed slowly, but faster and better. Before the spring plowing this year, the commune Party committee proposed implementing cart transportation for fertilizer delivery, which was a large task with a tight deadline. After accepting this task, the branch did not immediately tell the commune members to make carts, but instead mobilized them to calculate a detailed comparison between human and animal transport versus cart transport, so that the commune members realized the superiority of cart transportation. As a result, all the commune members actively took action and built eighty-four various vehicles within five days. Not only did they complete the urgent task of delivering manure on time, but they also saved a lot of labor for wheat field management.

Their methods of doing ideological education work are flexible and diverse. They use methods such as factual comparisons, vivid examples, combining individual help with collective help, and combining praise with criticism, targeting different objects and different situations. Although these methods are different, they all achieve very good results.

Some ideological problems of commune members are usually educated through comparisons of the changes in life before and after liberation in the village and certain things in real life. For example, during the grain requisition last year, the branch used the suffering caused by the severe famine in 1929, compared with the fact that they suffered the same famine in 1957, but thanks to the strong support of the Party, they successfully overcame the famine. This unified the thinking of the commune members and completed the requisition task. This comparative education method, based on the personal experience of the masses, is easily accepted by them. The characteristic of the masses is "seeing is believing." Some problems are not easily understood by the masses just by explaining the principles, so the branch uses typical figures and typical examples, calling on the commune members to see for themselves, so that the commune members are easily convinced. A deputy captain of a production team had experience in production but was ideologically conservative. The branch frequently called on him to participate in experience exchange meetings and visit advanced technology exhibitions. Under the education of these vivid facts, this deputy captain broadened his horizons, improved his understanding, overcame his conservative ideas, and became an active promoter of advanced experience. In the sanitation movement, they organized visits to sanitation model units, and everyone actively took action to quickly catch up with the model units. The branch pays attention to individual help in the education of party members and commune members. However, in order to better help the individuals concerned and educate the masses, collective help is sometimes used. They generally use the form of meetings when a person's ideological problem is somewhat representative, or when the erroneous understanding is not enough and more help is needed. Criticism is carried out, and everyone helps to improve understanding. After this kind of help, the person who made the mistake corrected the mistake, and at the same time educated the masses.

### 随时随地作好政治思想工作  五十里铺党支部采用灵活多样的方法效果很好

    随时随地作好政治思想工作
    五十里铺党支部采用灵活多样的方法效果很好
    本报讯　中共甘肃省天水市耤口公社五十里铺支部，经常注意对党员和社员进行系统的政治思想教育工作，因而各项工作都搞得很好。
    首先，这个支部在历次运动中，都贯穿着社会主义和共产主义教育。合作化时期，他们对社员进行了组织起来走集体富裕道路的教育，克服了当时群众在土改后生活水平上升而产生的满足现状的思想，使群众有了组织起来的要求。合作化后，个别社员滋长了资本主义思想，认为参加合作社不自由，党支部经常通过党课、业余学校对党员和群众进行教育，讲明合作化的优越性，集体与个人利益的正确关系，坚定了社员走社会主义道路的决心。公社化后，党支部又对社员进行了公社化的优越性、共产主义远景的教育，使党员和社员进一步明确了在农村建设社会主义的方针、政策，和走向共产主义的具体道路。
    党支部除经常对党员和社员进行系统的社会主义教育外，在进行每项工作的时候，都特别注意了解和研究群众的思想动态，进行思想教育工作。不论任务怎样紧迫，支部总是坚持用自己或外地的事实和经验，向党员和社员说明为什么要这样做，应该怎样做，使领导上的要求变为群众的自觉行动。他们把交代完成任务的意义和完成任务的方法，看作是思想工作的一部分，从不草率从事和简单化。他们的这种工作方法，从表面看来，工作做得好像慢一些，但是理论一旦掌握了群众，就会成为巨大的物质力量。当群众真正懂得了道理之后，在自觉自愿的基础上，就会发挥出无穷的潜力。因而在实际上，完成的任务不是很慢，而是更快更好。今年春耕前，公社党委提出运送肥料实行车子化，任务很大，时间紧迫。支部接受这一任务后，并不是马上叫社员做车子，而是发动社员算了一笔用人畜搬运和车子搬运相对比的细账，使社员认识到运输车子化的优越性，因而全体社员都积极地行动起来，在五天以内大造各种车辆八十四部。不仅按时完成了送粪的紧急任务，还节省了许多劳力用于麦田管理。
    他们做思想教育工作的方法，是灵活的，多种多样的。他们针对不同对象、不同情况，采用事实对比、活人活事、个别帮助与集体帮助相结合、表扬与批评相结合的方法进行教育。这些方法虽然不同，但都能收到很好的效果。
    对社员的一些思想问题，通常是用本村解放前后的生活变化和现实生活中某些事情的对比方法进行教育。例如，去年征购粮食时，支部用1929年的严重灾荒所遭受的苦难，与1957年遭受同样灾荒，但由于有了党的大力支援，顺利地渡过灾荒的事实，统一了社员的思想，完成了征购任务。这种对比的教育方法，出自群众的亲身体验，容易为群众所接受。群众的特点是“眼见是实”，有些问题只说明道理，还不易为群众理解，支部就采用典型人物和典型事例，叫社员亲眼看看，这样社员就容易心服口服。有一个生产小队副队长，生产有经验，但思想保守。支部就经常叫他参加经验交流会，参观先进技术展览。在这些活生生的事实教育下，这个小队长开阔了眼界，提高了认识，克服了保守思想，成为推广先进经验的积极分子。在卫生运动中，组织参观卫生模范单位，大家也就积极行动起来，很快赶上了模范单位。支部对党员和社员的教育，大多注意个别帮助。但为了更好地帮助本人和教育群众，有时也采用集体帮助的办法。他们一般是当某个人的思想问题，具有一定的代表性，或对错误认识不够，需要更多的帮助时，就采用会议形式，开展批评，由大家帮助，提高觉悟。经过这样帮助，使有错误的人改正了错误，同时也教育了群众。
