Xinhua News Agency, July 28th dispatch from Moscow: The Soviet "Pravda" published a commentary on July 28th regarding the so-called "Captive Nations Week" organized by US "Cold War" proponents, stating that this provocative conspiracy suffered a shameful defeat. No honest person in the East or West participated in this adventurous movement.

The commentary stated that the free people of socialist countries responded with strong protests to those self-proclaimed "liberators"—the imperialists. Public opinion in these countries unanimously stated that this attack by "Cold War" advocates reflects the fear of American monopoly capitalists in the face of the magnificent achievements of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, the growing influence these achievements have on the minds of working people living under capitalist oppression, and the inevitable victory of socialism in the peaceful competition between the two systems.

"Izvestia," in a commentary, wrote: American leaders deliberately arranged "Captive Nations Week" to coincide with the opening of the American Exhibition in Moscow and Vice President Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union. It seems they were attempting to support the promotion of the "American way of life" that Nixon spoke about at the opening ceremony of the exhibition. The newspaper said that Soviet people are particularly good at distinguishing between propaganda and reality. Ordinary Soviet people will cordially entertain guests and make it very clear to them that the Soviet Union is not a place for promoting capitalist enslavement. The shameful failure of the so-called "Captive Nations Week" is completely reasonable.

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Newspapers in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Albania, and other countries have recently published articles and commentaries strongly condemning the provocative actions of the US ruling circles in holding "Captive Nations Week."

An article in the Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" pointed out that holding the anti-Soviet, anti-socialist "Captive Nations Week" movement once again demonstrates the hypocrisy and shamelessness of American reactionaries. It proves that the words of American leaders about peace, mutual understanding, and peaceful coexistence are insincere, and that the United States has not abandoned its "Cold War" policy.

The Czechoslovak newspaper "Rude Pravo," in a commentary, said that extreme fear of the achievements of the Soviet Union and the growing prestige of socialism in the world is the reason for holding "Captive Nations Week" in this Ku Klux Klan country.

The Albanian newspaper "Zeri i Popullit" published a commentary stating that the provocative actions of the Eisenhower clique demonstrate the fear of US imperialism towards the great achievements of the Soviet Union and socialist countries, and the growing influence of these achievements on the people of all countries in the capitalist world.

### 社会主义国家舆论怒斥美国挑衅  指出上演“被奴役国家周”的丑剧是因为自己心虚

    社会主义国家舆论怒斥美国挑衅
    指出上演“被奴役国家周”的丑剧是因为自己心虚
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”28日就美国“冷战”鼓吹者组织所谓“被奴役国家周”发表评论说，这一挑衅阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。东西方任何一个正直的人也没有参与这个冒险的运动。
    评论说，社会主义各国的自由人民以强有力的抗议声回答了那些自封的“解放者”——帝国主义者们。这些国家的社会舆论一致表示，“冷战”鼓吹者的这种攻击反映了美国垅断资本家在苏联和整个社会主义阵营所取得的宏伟的成就面前、在这些成就对生活在资本压迫下的劳动人民的头脑中所产生的日益增长的影响面前、在两个体系的和平竞赛中社会主义的必然胜利的面前的恐惧心理。
      “消息报”在一篇评论中写道：美国领导人故意把“被奴役国家周”同美国展览会在莫斯科的开幕和美国副总统尼克松到苏联访问安排在一起。看来，他们企图支持尼克松在展览会开幕式上谈过的那种“美国生活方式”的宣传。报纸说，苏联人特别善于区别宣传和实际。普通的苏联人都会殷勤地招待客人，并且很好地使他们明白，苏联不是进行资本主义奴役宣传的地方。所谓“被奴役国家周”的可耻的失败是完全合情合理的。
    据新华社28日讯　保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、阿尔巴尼亚等国家报纸最近发表文章和评论，严厉谴责美国统治集团举行“被奴役国家周”的挑衅行动。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”的文章指出，举行“被奴役国家周”这一反苏、反社会主义的运动，再次表明了美国反动分子的伪善和无耻。它证明美国领导人关于和平、相互谅解、和平共处的言论是不真诚的，证明美国还没有放弃它的“冷战”政策。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”在评论中说，对苏联的成就和社会主义在世界上日益增长的威望的极度害怕，是在这个三K党国家中举行“被奴役国家周”的原因。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”发表评论说，艾森豪威尔之流的挑衅行为表明了美帝国主义害怕苏联、社会主义国家的巨大成就和这些成就对资本主义世界各国人民日益增长的影响。
