    Better Serve the People's Livelihood

    Our cause is a revolutionary cause. Serving the people is the glorious duty of every revolutionary. Precisely because we think of the people's interests in everything we do, and work for the people's interests in every place, we are able to unite the broad masses of the people and continuously achieve victory in the revolutionary cause.

    In recent years, on the basis of rapid development in production, the needs of the broad masses of the people in their economic lives have also become more extensive. Making every effort to improve the work of the service industries and better serve the people's lives is also an important task at present.

    In recent years, especially after the Great Leap Forward last year, the political consciousness of the broad masses of workers in the service industries has generally increased under the leadership of the Party. They have tried every possible means to serve customers and continuously expand their service business, and have made considerable achievements. For example, in the past year alone, while the national service industry transferred more than 25% of its personnel to support industrial and agricultural production, its annual turnover still increased by more than 40% compared with 1957. However, some people still have some incorrect views about the service industries. For example, some practitioners believe that the service industry is "serving people," which seems to be inferior; they feel "not glorious" and "without prospects," and so on. Whether the work of the service industry is glorious and promising is an issue that should be clarified first.

    We know that the social economy is very complex. To make the whole society operate normally like a machine, there must be a social division of labor: some people produce steel and coal; some people manufacture machinery and industrial products; some people produce grain and other cash crops; and some people directly serve people's clothing, food, housing, transportation, and use, and so on. Although the nature and roles of these departments and industries are different, primary and secondary, large and small, they are all important. The work of any industry is to serve social needs, to serve the people. Some serve the social need for steel and machinery, some serve the social need for grain and oil, some serve social production, and some serve social consumption. None of these departments or industries can be lacking. Just like performing a play, there must be leading actors and supporting actors, as well as backstage and front-stage service personnel. Although the service industry does not directly create wealth for society, it cannot be lacking in social and economic life. Look at food and beverage, hairdressing, bathhouses, hotels, laundry, clothing, photography, and repair, which of these industries is not closely related to the lives of the broad masses of the people? Of course, in the old society under reactionary rule, it is not surprising that the exploiting classes looked down on the service industry. But the situation today is fundamentally different. In our country, any work only has different social divisions of labor, and there is no distinction between high and low. Any labor that benefits the country and benefits the people is respected. If we must describe the work of the service industry as "serving people," then we are serving the millions of people who are working hard for socialist construction. Doing this kind of "serving people" work, trying our best to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people in their lives, bringing convenience and pleasure to their lives, so that they can devote themselves to production and work with more energy, is this not the most glorious and promising work? Is this not the true color of a revolutionary who serves the people?

    In fact, serving others and serving others is only one aspect of the problem. No one's life is isolated; it is closely related to the entire society and has thousands of connections. When a barber cuts hair for others, he is "serving people," and when he goes to the store to buy things, he is "served" by the salesperson; when he goes to eat, he is "served" by the cook; taking a car, watching a movie, visiting a park, and making clothes are all receiving "service" from others. Isn't this a fact that everyone often experiences personally? In our socialist family, everyone "serves" everyone. The better the work of "serving people" is done, the faster our socialist construction can move forward, and the more convenient and pleasant people's lives will be.

    The service industry is not only a detachment in the socialist labor army, but also a "social university" for cultivating and developing new types of relationships between people. The broad masses of the working people can certainly receive socialist education from political life and from schools, but they are more likely to feel in their daily lives that the relationship between people in socialist society is indeed different from the old society. A waiter or a salesperson comes into contact with the broad masses of people hundreds of times a day and serves them. Caring for customers everywhere, thinking of customers, and treating customers with a kind, warm, and polite attitude will give people a good and profound influence, and play a role in changing customs. Their labor has won the respect and gratitude of the broad masses of working people. Customers affectionately call the waiters comrades, enthusiastically write letters to praise them, and even make friends with them; doesn't this vividly illustrate that through service work, new socialist relationships between people are growing and developing? From this, we can draw the conclusion that, contrary to those who think that the work of "serving people" is "not glorious," the work of "serving people" is very glorious and worthy of pride.

    Our country's service industry has a long and excellent tradition. The service coverage is very wide. Wherever people's lives need it, there is a service industry to serve this need. Take the catering industry as an example. For thousands of years, the cooking dishes created by the working people of our country are no less than five thousand kinds, which are truly diverse and too numerous to count, and each has its own unique flavor in the east, west, north and south, becoming a valuable cultural heritage of our country. In recent years, our country's hairdressing, clothing and other industries have also enjoyed a great reputation for their superb skills. All these excellent traditions should be inherited by us, carried forward, passed on from generation to generation, in order to enrich the material and cultural life of the broad masses of the people, and add color to the people's lives. This is a glorious and important task for the broad masses of workers in the service industry.

    It is precisely because the service industry is very closely related to the people's lives that the Party and the government have always attached importance to the service industry. Since 1956, the Party has carried out socialist transformation of private service industries, sent a large number of cadres to the service industries, and established technical schools to train many technicians for the service industries; and established a series of leading organizations from top to bottom, expanding and building many new service points and stations, fundamentally changing the face of the service industry before liberation with its simple equipment and backward technology. The Party and the government's emphasis has created favorable conditions for the development of the service industry. Although there are still some problems in the service industry at present, such as some service industries appear unable to meet the needs due to the increase in urban population; during the Great Leap Forward last year, some people were transferred to support industrial and agricultural production, and the number of personnel and service points in some service industries decreased, bringing some inconvenience to the people. But as long as we make efforts, these problems can be solved quickly. Recently, the Party committees of many cities are personally grasping the work of the service industry, and taking active measures to restore the original service industry and strengthen the leadership of the service industry. The situation that some service industries cannot meet the needs is being rapidly improved. In order to further improve the work of the service industry, we should also pay attention to doing the following work:

    First, fully tap the potential of the service industry and carry out cooperation between industries. This is an effective way to expand service business at present. For example, restaurants also run breakfast, department stores and other industries also appropriately run some repair business, mobilize and organize urban residents to run some service businesses that can be done to supplement the shortage of the service industry. These methods are worth promoting.

    Second, at present, some tools and raw materials needed by the service industry are in short supply, and should be appropriately resolved. Many of these things are not used in large quantities, but they are indispensable. Experience has proved that as long as the relevant departments pay attention to making arrangements, this problem can be solved quickly. Of course, solving the problem of insufficient tools and raw materials also requires thinking of ways from many aspects. Now some catering industries in some areas have mobilized employees to raise pigs, poultry, and grow vegetables themselves, and the raw materials needed by the catering industry have been partially self-sufficient. These methods can be adopted in areas where conditions permit.

    Third, care for the lives of employees. The labor of service industry employees is very hard, and their lives should be cared for at all times. Now, the Party and the government are actively taking measures to solve the problem of insufficient personnel and equipment in some service industries, and are trying to improve the working conditions and welfare conditions of service industry employees to the extent possible. The broad masses of workers in the service industry should further improve their political awareness, continue to go all out, carry out the "six good" red flag movement in commerce, and create better achievements on the service front.

    The service industry is a personal socialist cause of ours. To do a good job in the service industry requires the care and support of all parties, and especially requires the full cooperation of the broad masses of customers. We should understand the difficulties of the service industry employees in their work. It is not right to have a contemptuous attitude towards them and to make excessive demands on them. Therefore, it is the duty of every customer and a new custom of our new society to cherish and care for service personnel and to give them support and encouragement on a regular basis.

    更好地为人民生活服务
    我们的事业是革命的事业，为人民服务，是每一个革命者的光荣职责。正由于我们一切为人民的利益着想、处处为人民的利益工作，因而我们能够团结广大人民群众不断地取得革命事业的胜利。
    几年来，在生产迅速发展的基础上，广大人民在经济生活上的需要也越来越广泛了。尽一切努力搞好服务性行业的工作，更好地为人民的生活服务，这也是当前的一项重要工作。
    几年来，特别是经过去年的大跃进，服务行业的广大职工在党的领导下，政治觉悟普遍提高了。他们千方百计地为顾客服务，不断地扩大服务业务，做出了不少的成绩。例如，去年一年，全国服务性行业在抽出25％以上的人员支援工农业生产的情况下，全年营业额仍然较1957年增长了40％以上。但有一些人对服务性行业还或多或少地存在着一些不正确的看法。例如，有些从业人员认为服务性行业是“伺候人”的工作，似乎低人一等；感到“不光荣”，“没有出息”，等等。服务行业的工作光荣不光荣，有没有出息，这是一个应当首先弄清楚的问题。
    我们知道，社会的经济生活是十分复杂的。要使整个社会像一部机器那样正常地运转，就必须要有社会分工：有的人生产钢铁、煤炭；有的人制造机器和日用工业品；有的人要生产粮食和其它经济作物；也有的人要直接为人们的衣、食、住、行、用服务，等等。尽管这些部门和行业的性质不同、作用不同，有主有次，有大有小，但是它们都是重要的，任何一个行业的工作都是为了社会需要服务，都是为人民服务，有的为社会需要钢铁、需要机器服务，有的为社会需要粮食、需要油料服务，有的为社会生产服务，有的为社会消费服务，缺少了那一个部门那一个行业都不行。正像演戏一样，有了主角还要有配角，还要有后台和前台服务人员。服务行业虽然不直接为社会生产财富，但是在社会经济生活中缺少了它是不行的。请看，饮食、理发、浴池、旅店、洗染、服装、照像、修理等，这些行业那一项不是跟广大人民生活有着十分密切的关系呢？当然，在反动统治的旧社会里，剥削阶级把服务行业看得很低贱，这是不足为怪的。但是今天的情况已经根本不同了。在我们国家里任何工作都只有社会分工的不同，根本不存在着高低贵贱之分。任何有益于国家有益于人民的劳动都受到尊重。如果一定把服务行业的工作说成是“伺候人”的工作，那么，我们伺候的是千千万万为社会主义建设而辛勤劳动的人民。做这种“伺候人”的工作，尽力满足广大人民生活上的需要，给他们的生活带来方便和愉快，使他们更加精力充沛地投入生产和工作，这难道不是最光荣、最有出息的工作吗？这难道不正是一个为人民服务的革命者的本色吗？
    其实，为别人服务，伺候别人，这还只是说了问题的一个方面。任何人的生活都不是孤立的，都和整个社会息息相关，有着千丝万缕的联系。一个理发员给别人理发的时候是在“伺候人”，当他去商店买东西的时候，就得到售货员的殷勤“伺候”；去吃饭，就得到炊事员的“伺候”；乘汽车、看电影、逛公园、做衣服，也无一不是在受着别人的“伺候”。这不是每个人所经常亲身体验到的事实吗？在我们社会主义大家庭里，就是这样大家“伺候”大家。“伺候人”的工作越是做得好，我们的社会主义建设事业就越能以快速的步伐前进，人们就生活得越方便和越愉快。
    服务性行业不仅是社会主义劳动大军中的一个支队，同时又是培养和发展人和人之间新型关系的“社会大学”。广大劳动人民固然可以从政治生活中、从学校里受到社会主义教育，但是他们更容易在日常生活中感受到社会主义社会中人与人之间的关系，确实和旧社会不可同日而语。一个服务员、一个营业员，每天要成百次地和广大群众接触，为他们服务。处处关心顾客，为顾客着想，以亲切、热情和礼貌的态度对待顾客，都会给人们以良好的、深刻的影响，起着移风易俗的作用。他们的劳动博得了广大劳动人民的尊重和感激。顾客亲热地称呼服务员为同志，热情地写信表扬他们，甚至和他们交了朋友；这不是很生动地说明了通过服务工作，人和人之间社会主义的新型的关系正在成长、发展着吗？由此可以得出的结论，和那些认为“伺候人”的工作“不光荣”的看法恰恰相反，“伺候人”的工作是十分光荣而又值得自豪的。
    我国的服务行业有着悠久的优良传统。服务面非常广，凡是人民生活需要，都有服务行业为这种需要服务。就拿饮食业来说，几千年来，我国劳动人民创造的烹饪菜品就不下五千种，真是种类繁多，举不胜举，而且东南西北各有其独特风味，成为我国一份宝贵的文化遗产。近年来，我国的理发、服装等行业，也以技术高超享有很大的声誉。所有这些优良的传统，我们都应当继承下来，发扬光大、传种接代，以丰富广大人民的物质文化生活，给人民生活增添色彩，这是服务行业广大职工一项光荣而重要的任务。
    正是因为服务行业和人民生活关系十分密切，党和政府对服务行业一向是重视的。1956年以来，党对私营的服务性行业实行了社会主义改造，向服务行业派出了大批干部，开办了技术学校，为服务行业培养和训练了不少技术人员；并且从上到下建立了一系列的领导机构，扩建和新建了不少服务点、站，从根本上改变了解放前服务行业设备简陋、技术落后的面貌。党和政府的重视，为服务行业的发展创造了有利的条件。尽管目前服务行业还存在着一些问题，如由于城市人口增加，某些服务行业显得不能适应需要；去年大跃进中，抽调了一部分人支援工农业生产，一部分服务行业的人员和服务点减少了，给人民带来某些不便。但只要经过努力，这些问题是完全可以迅速解决的。最近许多城市的党委都在亲自抓服务行业的工作，并采取积极措施，恢复了原有的服务行业，加强了对服务行业的领导，某些服务行业不能适应需要的情况正在迅速改进。为了进一步改善服务行业的工作，我们还应当注意做好这样一些工作：
    第一，充分挖掘服务行业潜力，开展行业之间的协作，这是当前扩大服务业务的一个有效的办法。例如餐馆兼营早点，百货和其它行业的商店适当兼营一部分修理业务，发动和组织城市居民办一些可能办到的服务业务，以补服务行业的不足。这些办法都值得提倡。
    第二，目前服务行业需用的某些工具和原料不足，要适当解决。其中许多东西用量不多，但缺少了它们又不行。经验证明，只要有关部门注意给以安排，这个问题是很快可以解决的。当然，解决某些工具和原材料不足的问题还要从多方面想办法。现在有些地区的饮食业发动职工自己养猪、养家禽、种菜，饮食业需要的原料已能部分自给。这些办法在有条件的地区都是可以采取的。
    第三，关心职工生活。服务行业职工的劳动是十分辛苦的，应当时刻关心他们的生活。现在，党和政府正在积极采取措施解决某些服务行业人员和设备不足的问题，正在可能范围内设法改善服务行业职工的工作条件和生活福利条件。服务行业广大职工则应进一步提高政治觉悟，继续鼓足干劲，开展商业上的“六好”红旗运动，在服务战线上创造出更好的成绩来。
    服务性行业是我们一项切身的社会主义事业。要搞好服务性行业的工作就需要各方面的关心和支持，特别需要广大顾客给以充分的协作。应当体谅服务行业职工工作上的困难。对他们抱着轻视的态度，向他们提出过分的要求，都是不应该的。因此，爱护、关心服务人员，经常地给他们以支持和鼓励，是每一个顾客应尽的义务，也是我们新社会的一种新风尚。
