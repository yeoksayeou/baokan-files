North-South Chang Street – Hygiene Red Flag
Seven Years of Consistent Hygiene Work
By Our Reporter Liu Peiheng

    For seven years, North-South Chang Street in Beijing has maintained its honor as a city-wide hygiene red flag.

    The residents of this street have developed good habits of loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene. Before the bell rings to urge street sweeping every morning, groups of men, women, old and young residents are already consciously sweeping the areas they are responsible for. Hygiene supervisors wearing armbands also appear on the street, earnestly performing their supervisory duties. In a short while, the streets and alleys are cleaned everywhere. No matter the size or condition of the courtyards, they are all tidied up in an orderly manner. Every household has bright windows and clean furniture and bedding, all neatly placed.

    No. 30, Jia, North Chang Street is a large communal courtyard, home to more than fifty households, including tricycle workers, carpenters, and bricklayers. Every household's cooking utensils are scrubbed until they shine. Everyone puts their chopsticks in cloth bags after use. Bowls and plates are washed and scalded after use. Each family's tableware is used separately to prevent the spread of disease. The children in this courtyard have generally developed the habit of washing their hands before meals and after using the toilet, and they also understand hygienic knowledge such as not eating rotten fruits. One day, a vendor selling rotten apricots shouted in front of the courtyard gate, "Six large apricots for a fen!" Four children, including three-year-old Bai Xiuying and six-year-old Wang Xizheng, who were playing in front of the gate, said to the vendor with their hands behind their backs, "Eating rotten fruits makes you sick, we won't buy them." There are many children in this courtyard. There are twenty-six children between the ages of three and school age. So far this summer, not a single child has suffered from dysentery.

    For several years, North-South Chang Street, with more than 2,000 households, has been able to make patriotic hygiene work a regular practice, primarily by adopting the method of "comprehensive arrangement and multi-faceted integration," correcting the phenomenon of "a gust of wind during the hygiene campaign, and desolation after the campaign" that occurred in past hygiene movements. Adhering to the principle that hygiene work should serve production and central tasks, they use all gatherings and other work to coordinate propaganda and arrangement of hygiene work. For example, in April, there were nine tasks on the street, including re-electing the residents' committee, repairing houses, and promoting conservation. They seized various opportunities to link various practical tasks to promote hygiene, taking advantage of the re-election of the residents' committee to propose doing a good job in hygiene work to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day. While promoting conservation, they also explained that paying attention to hygiene and preventing diseases can save medical expenses, so that residents realized the significance of carrying out hygiene work and automatically paid attention to it in their daily lives. This ensured that hygiene work was not squeezed out by other central tasks, and that hygiene work was consistently maintained.

    The medical personnel of the street's joint clinic also use mass gatherings to introduce hygiene knowledge. Sometimes, when medical personnel see children making noise during parents' meetings, they organize the children together to talk about washing hands before meals and after using the toilet, and not eating rotten fruits, or lead the children to swat flies. The medical personnel of the clinic tried to form children over three years old into children's groups, and gradually organized all 849 children on the street into 29 groups. They regularly educate them on hygiene, good manners, etc., and also compile hygiene nursery rhymes such as paying attention to hygiene, cutting fingernails, washing hands before meals and after using the toilet. They taught the children to remember them well and gradually developed various hygiene habits.

    The patriotic hygiene work on this street sets different specific requirements according to different seasons throughout the year. In the spring, when pupae began to revive, they launched a hygiene campaign with "eliminating the first generation of flies" as the central content, putting forward the slogan "Dig out and smash everything to let the flies die without offspring." Each residents' committee formed assault teams to conduct a comprehensive encirclement and suppression of pupae in damp places, sewage pools, or around nearby toilets. When summer came, they determined a hygiene campaign centered on preventing dysentery, strengthening fly swatting and food hygiene, and launching large-scale hygiene propaganda. When medical personnel went deep into the streets to talk about hygiene knowledge, they asked residents to watch the water in dirty ditches and pictures of dysentery bacilli under a microscope. Through visual education, the masses understood the causes of dysentery. The staff of the street canteen also promoted washing hands before meals to customers and prepared hand washing utensils. Some non-staple food store salespersons also constantly talked about washing and scalding raw fruits and vegetables when selling them. The shop assistants also made a system of inspection to not sell rotten food.

    The residents of this street also collectively formulated some hygiene systems, which is also an important part of maintaining hygiene regularly. Sweeping the streets twice a day in the morning and evening, sprinkling water on the streets when it is hot, swatting mosquitoes and flies, and sanitary activities such as holiday raids have almost become a habit for residents. The four residents' committees take turns to be responsible for the cleaning and maintenance of environmental sanitation. Someone is also responsible for supervision in each courtyard. There is also a Patriotic Hygiene Day every week. The residents' committees often form inspection teams on this day to conduct hygiene inspections, and regularly conduct more in-depth cleaning inspections to urge every household to maintain cleanliness and hygiene regularly. In the course of carrying out regular hygiene campaigns, this street also adopted the method of establishing model courtyards to set an example, as an advanced unit in this street and this alley, organizing the masses to visit and drive the overall hygiene work. Sometimes, it also seizes weak links, focusing on large courtyards with poor hygiene, organizing forces to help clean up and improve hygiene; it also organizes visits to encourage confidence in persisting in doing a good job in hygiene. Now, most areas of this street have seen hygiene model courtyards.

    南北长街——卫生红旗
    七年坚持卫生工作如一日
    本报记者　刘佩珩
    北京市南北长街，七年来一直保持着全市卫生红旗的荣誉。
    这条街道的居民已养成爱清洁、讲卫生的良好习惯。每天清晨催人扫街的铃声还没响起，街头和院内早就有成群的男女老幼居民，自觉地在各自负责的地片清扫起来。带着袖章的卫生监督员也出现在街头，认真地执行着监督的职责。一会儿功夫，街头巷尾到处都打扫得干干净净。不管大小庭院或条件好坏也都收拾得有条有理。家家户户窗明几净，被褥、家具，都放的整整齐齐。
    北长街甲三十号是个大杂院，这里住着三轮车工人、木匠、瓦工等五十多户人家。家家的大小炊具擦得发亮。每个人的筷子用过后分别放在布袋里。碗、碟用完都要洗烫。一家人的食具也都分开使用，以防传染疾病。这个院里的孩子们一般都养成了饭前便后洗手的习惯，也懂得不吃腐烂的瓜果等卫生知识。一天，有个卖烂杏的商贩在这个杂院门前大喊：“一分六个大杏！”正在门前玩耍的三岁白秀英和六岁的王希政等四个孩子背着手朝着商贩说：“吃腐烂瓜果生病，我们不买。”这个院里孩子很多，光三岁到学龄前的儿童就有二十六个，今年夏天到目前还没有一个孩子患痢疾的。
    有二千多户的南北长街，几年来能把爱国卫生工作作到经常化，首先是采取了“全面安排，多边结合”的办法，纠正了过去卫生运动出现的“运动来了一阵风，运动过了冷清清”的现象。他们本着卫生工作服从、服务于生产、中心工作的原则，利用一切集会活动和其他工作，配合宣传和布置卫生工作。例如，4月间，街道上有改选居民委员会、房屋修缮和宣传节约等九项工作。他们抓住各种机会联系各项实际工作宣传讲卫生，趁着改选居民委员会的时机，提出搞好卫生工作迎接“五一”劳动节。在宣传节约的同时，也讲解注意卫生防疾病，可以节省医药费的道理，这样就使居民们认识到开展卫生工作的意义，在日常生活中自动地重视起来。这样就保证了卫生工作没被其他中心工作挤掉，使卫生工作经常坚持了下来。
    街道上联合诊所医务人员也利用群众集会时介绍卫生知识。有时医务人员看到家长开会时小孩吵闹，就把孩子们组织在一起，讲饭前便后洗手和不吃腐烂瓜果等卫生知识，或领孩子们扑打苍蝇。诊疗所的医务人员，想法把三岁以上的学龄前儿童组成儿童小组，逐渐地把全街道的八百四十九个孩子都分别组织在二十九个小组里。每周定期对他们进行讲卫生、懂礼貌等教育，还编好讲卫生、剪指甲、饭前便后洗手等卫生歌谣。教孩子们记熟，并逐渐养成了各项卫生习惯。
    这条街的爱国卫生工作，一年四季都按不同的季节提出不同的具体要求。春天蛹开始复生时，他们就以“消灭苍蝇第一代”为中心内容展开卫生运动，提出“挖尽砸绝让苍蝇断子绝孙”的口号。各居民委员会都组成突击组到潮湿的地方、污水池或附近的厕所周围向蛹进行全面围剿。当夏季来临，他们又确定了以防痢为中心的卫生运动，加强扑蝇和饮食卫生，展开大规模的卫生宣传。医务人员深入街道讲卫生知识时，请居民在显微镜下观看脏水沟的水和痢疾杆菌的图片，通过直观教育，让群众了解痢疾发病的原因。街道食堂的工作人员也向顾客宣传饭前要洗手，并准备好洗手用具。有的副食品商店售货员在卖菜时，也不断地讲生吃瓜果要洗烫。店员们也订出检查制度，不卖腐烂食物。
    这个街道的居民还集体制订一些卫生制度，也是保持卫生经常化的一个重要环节。每天早晚两次扫街，天热时泼街，扑打蚊蝇，节日突击等卫生活动，差不多已经成为居民的习惯。四个居民委员会都分片轮流负责环境卫生的清扫保洁工作。每个院子也有人负责监督。每周还有一个爱国卫生日，居民委员们也常在这天组成检查小组进行卫生检查，还定期进行比较深入的扫除检查，督促家家户户经常保持清洁卫生。这个街道在展开经常性卫生运动中，还采取树立标兵院的办法，树立榜样，作为本街本巷的先进单位，组织群众参观，带动起全面卫生工作。有时，也抓薄弱环节，把卫生工作较差的大院作重点，组织力量帮助清扫，搞好卫生；还组织参观，鼓舞坚持搞好卫生工作的信心。现在，这个街道上绝大部分地区都出现了卫生标兵院。
