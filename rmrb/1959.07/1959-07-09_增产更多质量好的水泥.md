To produce more and better quality cement

    In the first half of this year, the national cement industry workers have launched a warm high-quality, high-yield campaign, which has achieved remarkable results. Cement quality has been generally improved, according to statistics, the average grade of cement from twenty-nine large and medium-sized cement plants in the second quarter has reached more than 400, that is to say, the average compressive strength of cement per square centimeter is more than 15 kilograms higher than that of cement produced in the first quarter; cement production is also 320,000 tons more than that of the first quarter. The achievement of this result provides favorable conditions for ensuring the completion of the cement production increase plan this year and promoting the smooth realization of the national construction plan.
    Cement is an important material, along with steel and wood is a major building material for capital construction. Whether industry, water conservancy, transportation and ordinary civil construction, all need a lot of cement. With the development of the national economy, the use of cement is also expanding, it can partially replace wood, which is relatively scarce in our country, and can also replace part of the steel. For example, utility poles on city streets in our country, iron towers for overhead high-voltage power lines, railroad ties, mine props, and even electrical insulation boards, oil pipelines, etc., are gradually being replaced by cement products or asbestos cement products. At present, although China's cement production has increased by about fifteen times compared with the early days of liberation, the supply of cement still cannot meet the actual needs of various aspects due to the rapid development of the national economy. Therefore, while accelerating the construction of new cement plants, fully tapping the potential of existing cement enterprises and increasing cement production in large quantities is of great significance not only for ensuring the realization of the national construction plan this year, but also for saving wood and steel.
    There are two ways to increase cement production: one is to only focus on output and relax quality; the other is to focus on both high output and high quality, with equal emphasis on output and quality. Experience proves that the former method is obviously incorrect, because quality and quantity are two aspects of a contradictory unity, and only by maintaining a certain quality, the increased quantity has practical significance. Otherwise, it will not only cause losses to the cement enterprise itself, but more seriously, if poor quality cement is used in the state's key construction projects, it will reduce the quality of the project, shorten the life of the project, and even cause greater losses. Therefore, constantly educating all employees to pay attention to the quality of cement is an important political task for leaders of the cement industry. After the high-quality, high-yield campaign in the first half of the year, the quality of cement has been improved a lot, but strictly speaking, it is not stable enough. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen quality education for employees, so that everyone can pay attention to the quality of cement, and carry out high-yield campaigns on this basis.
    To further improve the quality and output of cement, we must strengthen enterprise management, give full play to the role of testing agencies, and establish and improve rules and regulations related to ensuring quality. Last year, the national cement enterprises carried out mass movements, implemented the management method of "two participations and three combinations," streamlined institutions, and abolished unreasonable rules and regulations, which played a significant role in promoting the great leap forward of the cement industry, which must be affirmed. However, there is also another situation, that is, some enterprises, while carrying out mass movements, did not further strengthen enterprise management and establish necessary responsibility systems; the implementation of some reasonable rules and regulations was not resolute and serious enough, or new rules and systems were not established and improved according to the new situation, thus, some abnormal phenomena appeared in the production of some enterprises, affecting the further improvement of cement production and quality. Modern cement industry is a kind of heavy chemical industry with complex production process, a set of scientific management system and organization is necessary to ensure normal production. Among the enterprise management systems stipulated in the past, some were unreasonable and should be abolished, but many were the summary of predecessors' experience and correctly reflected the laws of production, which should be strictly implemented and developed according to the new situation. Facts have proved that in the process of reforming enterprise management by carrying out mass movements last year, those who did so not only made a leap in management level, but also achieved remarkable results in production. For example, the Liulihe and Huaxin Cement Plants have always adhered to the principle of combining centralized leadership and mass movements. While abolishing unreasonable rules and regulations, they retained the reasonable parts and relied on the masses to revise and supplement them. In this way, strengthening enterprise management has become a conscious action of the masses. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the cement production of these two plants has been rising linearly, without a ton of unqualified cement, and most of the cement produced is half a grade higher than the national standard (such as the standard of 400, this plant supplies 450).
    More, faster, better and more economical is a comprehensive construction policy. While carrying out the high-yield campaign on the basis of high quality, we must also pay attention to improving cost management and continuously reducing the cost of cement production. At present, what needs to be particularly emphasized in cost management is that we must conscientiously implement the three-level (factory, workshop, team) economic accounting system, do a good job in quota management and economic activity analysis, and compile cost reduction plans and measures on a quarterly and monthly basis. In addition to ensuring it in the system, we must also improve labor organization and launch a mass technological innovation movement to continuously improve labor productivity and reduce the consumption of raw materials, which are the main measures to reduce production costs.
    Safe production is an important condition to ensure the normal operation of production. If we do not pay attention to safe production, it will affect the output and quality of cement. Therefore, vigorously improving equipment management and ensuring frequent and safe operation is also an important task for current cement enterprises. All cement plants must conscientiously do a good job in equipment maintenance, strengthen the education of new workers in observing operating procedures, do a good job in regular equipment maintenance and inspection, and actively cultivate machine repair forces, and strive to manufacture some equipment and accessories themselves.
    The central link of doing a good job in the above aspects lies in strengthening the party's leadership in the enterprise, improving the factory director responsibility system under the collective leadership of the party committee, and at the same time closely combining it with the current in-depth development of high-quality, high-yield mass movement. Only in this way can we give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of employees, achieve unity from top to bottom, and be full of fighting spirit, so that cement production can continue to develop.
    The third quarter is a decisive quarter for completing the annual cement production increase plan. We hope that on the basis of the achievements already made in the first half of the year, the national cement plants will continue to exert their efforts, take advantage of the victory to advance, according to the spirit of the national cement enterprise five-level cadre meeting, strengthen enterprise management, do a good job in technological innovation, seize the third quarter, work hard for three months, further promote the mass movement of high quality and high yield, and welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day with new and greater production achievements.

    增产更多质量好的水泥
    今年上半年，全国水泥工业职工热烈开展的优质高产运动，已经获得了显著成绩。水泥质量普遍提高了，据统计，第二季度二十九个大中型水泥厂出厂水泥的平均标号已达四百号以上，也就是说，平均每平方公分水泥的抗压能力比第一季度出厂水泥增加了十五公斤多；水泥的产量也比第一季度多生产了三十二万吨。这一成绩的取得，对保证今年完成水泥增产计划，和促进国家建设计划的顺利实现，都提供了有利的条件。
    水泥是一项重要物资，它与钢铁、木材同为基本建设的主要建筑材料。不论工业、水利、交通运输和普通的民用建筑，都需要大量水泥。随着国民经济的发展，水泥的用途也正在日益扩大，它可以部分地代替我国资源比较缺乏的木材，还可以代替一部分钢材。例如我国城市街道上的电线杆、架高压电线用的铁塔、铁路上的枕木、矿井中的坑木、甚至电气绝缘板、输油管等等，都正在逐步用水泥制品或石棉水泥制品来代替。目前，我国的水泥产量虽已比解放初期增长了约十五倍，但是由于国民经济的迅速发展，水泥的供应还不能满足各方面的实际需要。因此，在加速新水泥厂建设的同时，充分挖掘现有水泥企业的潜力，大量增产水泥，不但对保证实现今年的国家建设计划，而且对节约木材和钢材，都有着非常重要的意义。
    增产水泥，有两种办法：一种是只抓产量放松质量；另一种是既抓高产又抓优质，产量和质量并重。经验证明：前一办法显然是不正确的，因为质和量是矛盾统一的两个方面，只有保持在一定质的基础上，增产的数量才有实际的意义。否则，不仅会造成水泥企业本身的损失，更严重的是如果把质量不好的水泥用之于国家的重点建设工程，将会降低工程质量，缩短工程寿命，甚至造成更大的损失。所以，经常不断地教育全体职工重视水泥的质量，是水泥工业领导者的一项重要的政治任务。经过上半年的优质高产运动，水泥质量已经提高不少，但是，严格地说来还是不够稳定的。因此必须继续加强对职工的质量教育，做到人人都能重视水泥质量，并在这个基础上开展高产运动。
    要进一步提高水泥的质量和产量，必须加强企业管理，充分发挥化验机构的作用，建立和健全有关保证质量的规章制度。去年全国水泥企业大搞群众运动，实行了“两参三结合”的管理办法，精简了机构，废除了不合理的规章制度，对推动水泥工业大跃进起了重大作用，这是必须肯定的。但是也还有另一种情况，就是有些企业在大搞群众运动的同时，没有进一步加强企业管理，建立必要的责任制；对有些合理的规章制度执行得不够坚决认真，或者没有根据新的情况建立和健全新的规章和制度，这样，就使某些企业在生产上出现了不正常的现象，影响了水泥的产量和质量的进一步提高。现代化水泥工业是重化学工业的一种，生产过程复杂，必须有一套科学的管理制度和组织机构才能保证生产正常进行。在过去规定的一些企业管理制度中，有一部分是不合理的，应当废除，但也有不少是前人经验的总结，是正确反映了生产规律的，应当严格执行，并根据新的情况加以发展。事实证明，在去年大搞群众运动改革企业管理过程中，凡是这样做了的，不但使管理水平跃进了一步，生产也收到显著效果。例如琉璃河、华新两水泥厂由于一直坚持集中领导和群众运动相结合的方针，在取消不合理的规章制度的同时，保存了合理的部分，还依靠群众进行了修改和补充。这样，使加强企业管理成了群众自觉的行动。从去年大跃进以来，这两个厂的水泥产量一直直线上升，没有出过一吨不合格的水泥，而且大部分出厂水泥比国家规定的标准还高了半个标号（如规定四百号，这个厂供应的是四百五十号）
    多快好省是全面的建设方针，在优质的基础上开展高产运动的同时，还必须注意改善成本管理，不断降低水泥生产的成本。当前在成本管理方面特别需要强调的是必须认真贯彻执行三级（厂、车间、小组）经济核算制，做好定额管理和经济活动分析，并按季按月地编制降低成本的计划和措施。除了在制度上保证以外，还必须改进劳动组织，发动群众开展技术革新运动，以不断提高劳动生产率和降低原材料的消耗，这是降低生产成本的主要措施。
    安全生产是保证生产正常进行的重要条件，如果我们不注意安全生产，就会影响到水泥的产量和质量。所以大力改进设备管理，做到经常安全运转，也是当前水泥企业的一项重要工作。各个水泥厂必须认真做好设备的检修工作，加强对新工人遵守操作规程的教育，作好经常性的设备维护和检查工作，并且要积极培养机修力量，争取自己制造一些设备和配件。
    做好上述各方面的工作的中心一环，还在于加强企业的党的领导，健全党委集体领导下的厂长负责制，同时要与目前正在深入发展的优质、高产的群众运动紧密结合起来。这样才能充分发挥职工的积极性和创造性，做到上下齐心，斗志旺盛，使水泥生产不断向前发展。
    第三季度是完成全年水泥增产计划的决定性的季度。我们希望全国水泥厂在上半年已经取得的成就的基础上，继续鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，根据全国水泥企业五级干部会议的精神，加强企业管理，搞好技术革新，抓紧第三季度，大干三月，把优质高产的群众运动更向前推进一步，用新的更大的生产成就来迎接国庆十周年。
