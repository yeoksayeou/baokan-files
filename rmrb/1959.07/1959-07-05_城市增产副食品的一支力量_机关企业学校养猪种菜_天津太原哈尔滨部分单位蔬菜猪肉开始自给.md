Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th—Two hundred and seventy government offices, enterprises, schools, and other units in Tianjin have raised over 40,000 pigs of all sizes, as well as a considerable number of chickens and fish, and planted many vegetables.

These units combine the development of non-staple food production with the participation of cadres and students in labor training. The pig farms, poultry farms, and vegetable gardens of each unit are mainly managed by full-time personnel, but personnel from the unit also participate in labor in rotation. Some family members of employees also participate in non-staple food production.

The units adopt a self-reliant approach to solve the feed and fertilizer problems needed to develop non-staple food production. The feed for pigs mainly comes from swill and vegetable leaves collected from the cafeteria, as well as wild grass picked from vegetable gardens and fields. The fertilizer for the vegetable gardens is obtained by employees using their spare time to dig manure pits and drain sewage.

Although these units have only been developing non-staple food production for a short time, they have already achieved some results. A hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Tianjin raised more than 300 pigs and planted more than 20 mu of vegetables in the land in front of and behind the houses. Now the hospital's vegetables are more than self-sufficient. The staff canteen of the Xinhe Oil Depot of Tianjin Petroleum Purchasing and Supply Station now sells vegetables grown by the staff themselves, and the price is half as cheap as before.

Our newspaper Taiyuan, 4th—Many government offices, enterprises, and schools in Taiyuan raise pigs and grow vegetables, vigorously engaging in non-staple food production.

Units under the Shanxi Provincial Military Region, such as troops and hospitals, have basically become self-sufficient in meat and vegetables. In the first half of the year, they also supplied the state with 45 fat pigs weighing more than 150 jin. They are conducting scientific fattening of pigs, improving feeding methods, and increasing the rate of meat growth in pigs. Xing'an Chemical Materials Factory has been using vacant land in the newly built factory area since last year to run its own small farms and vigorously engage in non-staple food production. In the employee cafeteria, it is often possible to eat fresh vegetables grown by themselves. Hospitals, health canteens, and kindergartens can often buy fresh eggs from their own farms. In order to continuously expand production, they have raised more than 40 sows to breed piglets and purchased a set of incubators to hatch various poultry. In addition to growing their own feed crops, they have also set up a flour mill to process vermicelli for the vegetable company, leaving the flour residue to feed the pigs. Shanxi Machine Tool Factory expanded pig production last year under the slogan "Strive for general non-staple foods not to be supplied by the market," increasing the total number of pigs from 40 to more than 200, while also feeding more than 1,100 chickens. The pork used by all employees during major festivals can basically be solved by themselves. Some of the eggs needed by some patients in the factory are partly produced and supplied by the factory itself.

In the development of non-staple food production such as growing vegetables, raising pigs, and raising chickens, the units adopt the method of cadres taking turns to participate in labor, and this part of the labor time is counted as the time for each cadre to participate in one month of physical labor per year. In terms of pig feed, in addition to purchasing some distiller's grains and tofu dregs from outside, they mainly use the leftover soup and food from the collective canteen.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 4th—Factories, enterprises, government offices, schools and other units in Harbin have set up more than 500 farms and ranches in the suburbs, developing poultry, livestock and vegetable production.

The earliest of these farms and ranches began to be prepared in 1952, and most of them were established in 1957 and 1958. They have played a certain role in improving the lives of employees and reducing the burden on national supply. For example, the farm and ranch run by the state-owned Weijian Machine Factory supplied 5.5 million jin of fresh vegetables and a large amount of meat, milk, and fresh eggs to the employee canteen from 1956 to 1958. If these non-staple foods were transported by the state, the freight alone would cost more than 12,000 yuan. The farm of the state-owned First Machinery Manufacturing Plant, which only opened at the beginning of this year, not only produced enough vegetables for the employee canteen to eat in May and June, but also sold some to the family members of employees. The farm of the Municipal People's Committee can now supply more than 2,000 jin of fresh eggs to the kindergarten and employee canteen of the agency every month, and also hatched 150,000 chicks this spring to supply to fraternal agency farms and people's communes in the suburbs; the pork produced, in addition to being supplied to the canteen according to the city's rationing standards, also turned over a batch to the state in May.

These farms and ranches are established in accordance with local conditions and in a simple manner. Most of the building materials and production tools for the farms and ranches are solved by excavating waste materials. For example, most of the various simple houses in the Weijian Machine Factory Farm are built by employees using waste materials and broken bricks and tiles. (Attached picture)

    城市增产副食品的一支力量
    机关企业学校养猪种菜
    天津太原哈尔滨部分单位蔬菜猪肉开始自给
    新华社天津4日电　天津市有二百七十个机关、企业、学校等单位，已经饲养了大小生猪共四万多头，还养了不少鸡、鱼，种了许多蔬菜。
    这些单位把发展副食品生产和干部、学生参加劳动锻炼结合起来。各单位的养猪场、养禽场和菜园场，除了有专职人员经营以外，主要由本单位的人员轮流参加劳动。有些单位的职工家属，也参加了副食品生产。
    各单位采取自力更生的办法，解决发展副食品生产所需要的饲料和肥料问题。猪的饲料，主要是从食堂搜集来的泔水和菜叶，还有从菜园野地里采摘的野草。菜园的肥料，都是由职工利用业余时间挖粪池掏污水得来的。
    这些单位发展副食品生产虽然为时不久，但是已经收到了一些效果。中国人民解放军在天津的一个医院养了三百多头猪，利用房前屋后的土地种了二十多亩蔬菜，现在医院的蔬菜已自给有余。天津石油采购供应站新河储油所的职工食堂，现在每天出售的菜，都是职工自己种植的，售价比过去便宜一半。
    本报太原4日电　太原市许多机关、企业、学校养猪、种菜，大搞副食品生产。
    山西省军区所属部队和医院等单位，肉食、蔬菜已基本上自给。上半年还供给国家一百五十斤以上的肥猪四十五头。他们正在进行生猪科学育肥，改善饲养方法，提高生猪长肉率。兴安化学材料厂从去年就利用新建厂区空闲土地，自办小型农场，大搞副食品生产。在职工食堂，经常能够吃到自己种的新鲜蔬菜。医院、保健食堂、幼儿园能够经常从他们自己的农场买到鲜蛋。为了不断扩大生产，他们饲养了四十多头母猪，繁殖小猪；购买了一套孵化器，孵化各种家禽。他们除了自己种植饲料作物外，还设立了一个粉场，为蔬菜公司加工粉条，自己留下粉渣喂猪。山西机床厂去年在“争取一般副食品不要市场供应”的口号下扩大了养猪生产，使养猪总数由四十头增加到二百头以上，同时喂了一千一百多只鸡。全厂职工在重大节日所用的猪肉，基本上已能自己解决。厂里一些病员所需的鸡蛋，部分已由厂里自己生产供应。
    各单位在发展种菜、养猪、养鸡的副食品生产中，采取干部轮流参加劳动的办法，这部分劳动时间算作机关干部每人每年参加一个月体力劳动的时间。在猪饲料方面，他们除从外面购买一部分酒糟、豆腐渣外，主要利用集体食堂的残汤剩菜。
    据新华社哈尔滨4日电　哈尔滨市的工厂、企业、机关、学校等单位，因陋就简地在郊区办起了五百多个农牧场，发展家禽家畜和蔬菜生产。
    这些农牧场，最早的在1952年就开始筹办，大多数是在1957和1958两年内建立起来的，它们对改善职工生活，减轻国家供应上的负担，已经起了一定的作用。如国营伟建机器厂兴办的农牧场，从1956至1958年供应了职工食堂五百五十万斤鲜菜和大量肉类、牛奶、鲜蛋，这些副食品如果由国家调运，仅运费就需要一万二千多元。今年初才开办的国营第一机械制造厂农场，5、6月份生产的蔬菜不仅够职工食堂食用，而且卖了一部分给职工家属。市人民委员会机关农场现在每月可以供给机关幼儿园和职工食堂二千多斤鲜蛋，今年春天还孵化了十五万只小鸡，供给各兄弟机关农场和郊区人民公社；生产的猪肉，除了按市民定量标准供给食堂以外，5月份还上缴一批给国家。
    这些农牧场都是因地制宜、因陋就简地建立起来的。农牧场的建筑材料和生产工具，绝大部分是通过挖掘废旧物资解决的。如伟建机器厂农场的各种简易房舍，大部分由职工利用废料和碎砖瓦搭盖。（附图片）
