    Magnetic Storm
    This refers to a strong disturbance of the Earth's magnetic field, which can last from several hours to several days. During a magnetic storm, the direction and strength of the Earth's magnetic field undergo irregular changes. It is caused by a large number of charged particle streams ejected from solar flares. Occurring simultaneously with magnetic storms are: disruption of shortwave radio communications, even complete cessation; and the appearance of auroras in the high altitudes of the northern and southern polar regions.
    From left to right:
    ?The flare of July 10th started at 10:00 am and lasted for more than two hours.
    ?At 11:40 am on July 14th, flares reappeared in the same group of sunspots, lasting for more than two hours.

    磁暴
    即地球磁场的强烈扰动，可持续几小时到几天。磁暴发生时，地磁场的方向和磁力的大小都产生不规则的变化。它是由太阳的耀斑抛射出来的大量带电粒子流所引起的。与磁暴同时产生的有：短波无线电通信受到阻碍，甚至完全停止；南北两极地区高空中出现极光。
    自左至右　?7月10日的耀斑从上午十时开始，延续两个多小时。
    ?7月14日十一时四十分，在同一群黑子上再次出现耀斑，延续有两小时多。
