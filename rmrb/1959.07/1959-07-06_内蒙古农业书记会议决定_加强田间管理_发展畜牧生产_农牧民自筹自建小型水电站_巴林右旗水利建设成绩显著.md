Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 5th. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee recently held a meeting of agriculture secretaries to discuss the current field management of crops and the development of animal husbandry production in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas.

The meeting believed that the autonomous region has made great achievements in agricultural production. The region has overfulfilled its planting plan; the quality of planting is also very good. The current task is to focus on field management. The meeting demanded that all localities invest more than 80% of their labor and animal power into summer hoeing and seedling protection work. At the same time, they must seize the opportunity to apply additional fertilizer, and make every effort to prevent and control pests and diseases such as wheat stem flies, cutworms, and wheat rust, to ensure a bumper harvest of wheat.

The meeting pointed out that Party organizations at all levels in the autonomous region must place leadership of agricultural production in an important position. The first secretaries of league, banner (county), and commune party committees must personally grasp agricultural production and concentrate their main forces to quickly launch a mass production movement centered on field management. Extensive comparisons and competitions should be launched between communes, teams, and individuals to compare their efforts, measures, quality, and results.

The meeting emphasized that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region should be built into one of the largest animal husbandry bases in the country. In vigorously developing animal husbandry production, in addition to purely pastoral areas, it is also necessary to make full use of the natural resources, animal husbandry foundation, and the experience of the people in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas. Agricultural and animal husbandry production must implement the principle of combining the two. In particular, in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, the interdependence, mutual development, and mutual restriction between agriculture and animal husbandry are greater, and they need to be closely integrated and developed proportionally. Generally speaking, the conditions for developing animal husbandry in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas are very good, so animal husbandry production should be developed in the same way as grain and cotton production. In the work of developing livestock, all localities should adopt the policy of combining public and private raising, and advocate that commune members raise their own livestock.

Developing livestock also requires finding ways to solve the feed problem, expanding the planting area, and rationally utilizing existing natural pastures.

Xinhua News Agency reports: People's communes in the agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are using the water resources of local small rivers and streams to establish small hydropower enterprises. At present, 33 hydropower (hydraulic) stations have been built in the region, with a total installed capacity of more than 650 kilowatts. Some of these hydropower stations have received national investment assistance, but most of them were self-funded and built by farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups, without spending a penny of state money.

This batch of small hydropower stations has brought many benefits to farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups. The hydropower station of the Qifendi People's Commune in Ongniud Banner, Zhaowuda League, can provide electricity to pump water to irrigate 1,000 mu of land, drive two rice milling machines and one flour mill, processing 20,000 jin of grain per day, and also provide electricity to 240 commune members' households. After the completion of the hydropower station in Aoerga Prairie, Bairin Right Banner, Mongolian herdsmen used electricity to milk cows, shear sheep, and process fried rice, greatly reducing physical labor and promoting the development of animal husbandry production.

Xinhua News Agency reports: After more than a year of hard work, the people of all ethnic groups in Bairin Right Banner, Inner Mongolia, have greatly improved the water conservancy conditions of farmland and feed bases, and established a well network on a large area of arid grassland.

Bairin Right Banner is located in the northern part of Zhaowuda League, with a dry climate, much wind and sand, and little rainfall. Although there are 19 rivers of various sizes in the territory, they have not been fully utilized. Starting last year, the Bairin Right Banner Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized the people of the whole banner to launch a water conservancy construction movement. In the past year or so, 149 new farmland irrigation canals, 37 small reservoirs and ponds have been built, 337 field irrigation wells have been built, expanding the irrigated area of farmland in the banner to 100,000 mu. Thirty-eight irrigation canals for feed bases have been built on the historically water-deficient grassland, nearly 2,000 pastoral wells have been developed, and 684 wells have been drilled on particularly arid waterless grassland. Two pastoral people's communes have also established small hydropower stations and mechanical water supply stations.

    内蒙古农业书记会议决定
    加强田间管理  发展畜牧生产
    农牧民自筹自建小型水电站  巴林右旗水利建设成绩显著
    本报呼和浩特5日电　最近，中共内蒙古自治区党委举行农业书记会议，讨论了当前农作物的田间管理和农业区、半农半牧区发展畜牧业生产的问题。
    会议认为，自治区目前农业生产取得很大成绩。全区播种计划已经超额完成；播种质量也很好。当前的工作就是要抓紧田间管理。会议要求各地把80％以上的劳动力、畜力投入夏锄保苗工作，同时，要抓紧追肥工作，要千方百计防治麦秆蝇、地老虎和小麦锈病等病虫灾害，保证小麦丰产丰收，颗粒还家。
    会议指出，全区各级党组织，必须把领导农业生产放在重要地位。盟、旗（县）、公社党委第一书记要亲自抓农业生产，集中主要力量迅速开展一个以田间管理为中心的群众性的生产运动。广泛开展社与社、队与队以及个人之间的比干劲、比措施、比质量、比效果的评比竞赛运动。
    会议强调指出，内蒙古自治区应当建设成为全国最大的畜牧业基地之一。在大力发展畜牧业生产方面，除纯牧区以外，还要充分利用农业区、半农半牧区的自然资源、畜牧业基础和人民群众经营牧业的经验。农牧业生产，必须实行相结合的方针。特别是农区、半农半牧区，农牧之间的相互依存、相互发展、相互制约性更大，需要紧密结合，按比例发展。一般说，农区、半农半牧区发展畜牧的条件是很好的，因此要像抓粮棉那样来发展畜牧生产。在发展牲畜工作上，各地应该采取公养与私养并举方针，提倡社员自养牲畜。
    发展牲畜还需要多方设法解决饲料问题，扩大种植面积，合理利用现有的天然牧场。
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区农业区和半农半牧区人民公社，利用当地小河沟溪的水力资源，兴办小型水电事业。目前全区已建成水电（水力）站三十三座，设备总容量六百五十多瓩。这批水电站一部分曾得到国家投资扶助，大部分由各族农牧民自筹自建，没有花国家一文钱。
    这批小型水电站，已给各民族农牧民带来了许多好处。昭乌达盟翁牛特旗七分地人民公社的水电站，能提供电力抽水浇地一千亩，能带动两台碾米机，一台磨粉机，每天加工粮食两万斤，还使当地二百四十户社员点上了电灯。巴林右旗敖尔盖草原建成水电站后，蒙古族牧民利用电力挤牛奶、剪羊毛、加工炒米，大大减轻了体力劳动，促进了畜牧业生产的发展。
    据新华社讯　内蒙古巴林右旗各族人民经过一年多的苦战，大大改善了农田和饲料基地的水利条件，并且在大片干旱草原上建立了水井网。
    巴林右旗在昭乌达盟北部，气候干燥，风沙多，雨量少。境内虽有十九条大小河流，但没有充分利用。从去年开始，中共巴林右旗委员会发动全旗人民，展开了水利建设运动。一年多来已新建农田灌渠一百四十九道，小型水库、塘坝三十七座，修筑田间灌溉井三百三十七眼，使全旗农田灌溉面积扩大到十万亩。在素来缺水的草原上修建了三十八条饲料基地灌溉渠道，开发牧场水井近二千眼，并在特别干旱的无水草原上打井六百八十四眼。有两个牧区人民公社还建立了小型水力发电站和机械供水站。
