"Ghost Sorrow Village"
Bai Nationality, Na Jialun

As it gradually got dark, I could vaguely see "Ghost Sorrow Village." I couldn't help but quicken my pace, my heart filled with excitement: "I'm going to see Grandma Yan again!"

Spring of 1950. One evening, I followed the troops to pursue and annihilate the remaining bandits here. As soon as we entered the village, our hearts immediately tightened: what a terrible disaster this place had suffered! We couldn't see a single person anywhere; large tracts of fertile land lay barren; everywhere there were broken walls and overgrown weeds; in the wasteland at the east end of the village, there were still a few unburied corpses, with crows and eagles noisily pecking at them…

Suddenly, from a dilapidated thatched hut, came a burst of mournful crying. We rushed over and, looking through the window, saw an emaciated, ragged old woman sitting by the bed, weeping bitterly. A boy lay stiffly on the bed. The bean-sized oil lamp illuminated the boy's sallow face.

We pushed the door open, and the old woman suddenly stood up, trembling with fright, pointing at the person on the bed and saying, "He only has one breath left. Please, have mercy!" We explained for a long time before she understood that we were not the "old yellow dogs" but the People's Liberation Army. Then, she asked us to save her son's life. The military doctor gave her son an injection, and he woke up shortly after. While we were treating her son, we asked about the situation in her village. She began to cry without saying a word.

Forty years ago, this was a prosperous village with five or six hundred people. Due to the exploitation by the chieftain and the ravages of schistosomiasis, people died by the dozens every year. The cruel chieftain said there were ghosts in this village, named it "Ghost Sorrow Village," and demarcated a boundary, forbidding anyone in the village from taking half a step out, and no one else was allowed to come to the village. No doctor dared to come to treat the sick, and even more people died! The old woman watched her husband and daughter die with her own eyes. Now, only a few dozen people remain in the entire village!

Hearing that we were going to pursue the remaining bandits, she entrusted her son to her neighbors and insisted on guiding us. It turned out that the leader of that group of bandits was the chieftain whom the whole village hated. That night, we fought a great battle – all the bandits were annihilated, and Grandma Yan personally shot the chieftain with a hunting rifle!

From then on, we became acquainted with Grandma Yan. Every time I passed by, I would come to visit her. I came in 1952 and 1954, and I didn't expect to have the opportunity to come again now!

I entered the village, and it was already completely dark, coupled with the dense fog, I couldn't see anything. Relying on my memory, I groped my way to Grandma Yan's door and was about to knock when "creak--" the door opened, and someone walked out and bumped into me. I focused my eyes in the lamplight and exclaimed in surprise, "Grandma Yan!" I saw that she seemed younger and plumper. She looked at me for a while before recognizing me: "Ah, Bo Bo, it's you! This morning, as soon as I opened the door, I saw the flowers in front of the house blooming, knowing that a distinguished guest would come! Which peacock led you here?" Before I could answer, she busily started to prepare: pouring boiling water, cooking, making the bed, and asking about my situation in the past few years like a string of firecrackers. After seeing me finish my meal, she said, "You sleep, Grandma still has to go to the cultural class." I asked about her son. "Oh, he went to the county for a meeting. He's a cadre, so busy that he doesn't even have time to find a wife!" She went out, leaving behind a burst of laughter.

I was very tired, washed the dishes, and went to bed. Lying in bed, looking at the roof, I realized that these three tile-roofed houses were newly built, the walls were whitewashed with lime, and the new table still smelled of pine… This home was simply brand new.

As soon as I opened my eyes, it was already dawn.

Grandma Yan and I went outside, and if Grandma Yan wasn't by my side, I wouldn't have dared to believe my eyes: almost all the houses were newly built, and there was also a building (Grandma said it was a school). Chickens and ducks were everywhere on the village paths, and men and women preparing to go to the fields and children going to school greeted Grandma with smiling faces.

"How are there so many people?" I asked. Grandma smiled and said, "This is a golden age. People are being born and nobody is dying! Some have even moved in from other villages! In less than two years, we will be even more lively than we were forty years ago!" I deliberately asked, "Aren't you worried about having too many people?" "Look at these good crops, three harvests a year. We'd never say there are too many people!" Following her hand, I saw that the mature rice in the terraced fields was golden, gently undulating in the morning breeze.

At this moment, I suddenly thought of the ugly village name and couldn't help but mutter, "Ghost Sorrow Village, this village name…" Grandma's eyes flashed with pride and said, "Hey, it was changed long ago, look!" She pointed to a wooden sign hanging on the tree opposite us, with three big characters written on it: "Le Ren Cun" (Happy People Village). The red characters were shining brightly in the sunlight!

### “鬼愁寨”

    “鬼愁寨”
    白族　那家伦
    天渐渐黑下来时，隐隐约约可以看到“鬼愁寨”了，我不由得加快步子，心里也兴奋起来：“这下又要见到岩大妈了！”
    1950年春天。一个傍晚，我随着部队追歼残匪到过这里。一跨进寨子，我们的心就立即紧缩起来：这是一个遭受过多么严重灾难的地方啊！四处看不到一个人影；大片良田荒芜着：到处是断垣残壁、蔓草丛生；寨东头荒地里，还有几具未掩埋好的尸体，乌鸦和老鹰正噪杂地在啄食……
    突然，一间破茅屋里，传来了一阵悲恸的哭声。我们急忙赶过去，隔着窗子一望：一个瘦骨棱棱、衣裳褴褛的老大妈，正坐在床边哭泣，床上直挺挺地睡着一个少年。豆样的油灯，照着少年那腊黄的脸。
    我们推门进去，老人蓦地一下站起来，吓得浑身抖擞，指着床上的人说：“他只剩下最后一口气了，你们行行好！”我们解释了半天，她才明白我们不是“老黄狗”，而是解放军。于是，她请我们救儿子的命。军医给她儿子打了一针，不一会他就醒过来了。我们一边为她的儿子治疗，一边问起她寨子里的情形。她没说话就先掉了泪。
    四十年前，这里是个人畜兴旺的寨子，有五六百口人。由于土司的剥削及血吸虫病的坑害，每年都成十成十的死去。狠心的土司就说这个寨里有鬼，把它取名为
  “鬼愁寨”，并且划了界，不准寨里的人走出半步，其他人也不能到寨里来。没有医生敢来看病，病人死的更多了！老大妈的男人、女儿都是她眼睁睁看着死去的。现在，全寨总共剩下几十个人了！
    听说我们要去追击残匪，她就把儿子托给邻人照看，一定要给我们带路。原来那股残匪的头子，就是全寨人痛恨的土司。那天夜里，我们打了一个大胜仗——土匪全部歼灭了，土司是岩大妈亲手用猎枪打死的！
    从此，我们跟岩大妈认识了。每次路过，我都要来看望一下她老人家。1952年、1954年都来过，没想到现在又有机会来了！
    我走进寨里，天已经黑定了，再加上浓雾迷漫，什么都看不清。我凭着记忆，摸索到岩大妈门前，正想敲门，“吱——”一声，门开了，一个人走出来和我撞了个满怀。我借着灯光定睛一看，便惊喜地喊道：“岩大妈！”我看见她仿佛变得年轻了，胖了。她端详了我一会，才认出来：“啊啵啵是你呀！今天早晨一开门，我看到屋前的花开了，晓得要有贵人来！是哪只孔雀把你引来的？”没等我回答，她就忙忙碌碌地张罗起来：倒开水、做饭、铺床，并像连珠炮似地问了我这几年的情形。看我吃完了饭，她才说：“你睡吧，大妈还要去上文化课。”我问起她儿子。“他呀，到县里开会去了。当了干部，忙得连媳妇都顾不上找！”她出去了，留下一串笑声。
    我很疲惫，洗了碗就上床睡觉了。躺在床上看看屋顶，才发觉这三间瓦房是新盖的，墙壁用石灰刷得雪白，新桌子还散发着松香气味……这个家简直是焕然一新了。
    一睁眼，天已经亮了。
    我和岩大妈走到门外一看，若不是大妈在身旁，我真不敢相信自己的眼睛了：房子差不多全是新盖的，还有一座楼房（大妈说那是学校），寨道上鸡鸭成群，准备下地的男女和上学的儿童满脸是笑地向大妈打招呼。
      “怎么有这样多人？”我问。大妈笑着说：“这阵是黄金世道，光生不死呀！还从外村搬来了些！出不了两年，我们就要比四十多年前更热闹了！”我故意问：“那样您不嫌人多吗？”“你瞧，这么好的庄稼，一年收三季。人再多也嫌少呀！”顺着她的手，我看到梯田里成熟的稻谷金黄一片，在晨风中微微起伏。
    这时，我突然想到那个难听的寨名，不禁念叨起来：“鬼愁寨，这寨名字……”大妈眼里闪着自豪的光辉，说：“嗳，早改了，你瞧！”她指给我看对面大树上挂着的木牌，上面写着三个大字：“乐人村”。红色的字在阳光照耀下正闪闪发光哩！
