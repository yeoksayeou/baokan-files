Title: The Way Out

Each large factory has a great deal of offcut waste that needs to be processed every day, and each small factory needs to consume a large number of raw materials and supplies every day. One needs to process, and the other needs raw materials. Where is the way out?

Following the trail of offcut waste from large factories, some goes to waste product recycling units for reprocessing; some is used as raw materials for small factories, and some is not recycled or utilized, piling up in the factory area, becoming a burden. It seems that the way out has not been completely arranged.

The purchasing personnel of small factories often travel back and forth, racking their brains to find raw materials. When they need thin materials, they only find thick materials; when they need short materials, they only find long and large materials. These materials are time-consuming and inconvenient to process after they are obtained. It seems that their way out has not been completely resolved.

In fact, there is a marriage between large and small factories in the use of raw materials: the offcuts of large factories are the raw materials of small factories; in the past, many small factories in Shanghai relied on large factories to survive. However, this relationship is spontaneous and only individually combined. Because of this, both the offcuts of large factories and the raw materials of small factories suffer from the difficulty of finding a way out.

Guangzhou investigates the offcut waste of large factories and establishes a fixed supply relationship between large and small factories in an organized and planned manner. This approach not only finds a source of raw materials for small factories but also arranges a way out for the offcut waste of large factories.

When vigorously developing light industry and increasing the production of small commodities in various places, the source of raw materials is broad, and the key lies in strengthening leadership.

    出路
    每个大厂每天有许许多多边材废料需要处理，每个小厂每天需要耗用大批的原料和材料。一个要处理，一个要原料，出路又何在？
    沿着大厂边材废料的踪迹，一部分是到废品收购单位回炉去了；一部分用作小厂的原料，还有一部分无人回收，也无人利用，堆积厂区，成了负担。看来，出路并没有完全安排好。
    小厂的采购人员，为了寻找原料，常常往来奔波，煞费苦心。当他们需要薄料的时候，偏偏只有厚料，需要短料的时候，偏偏只有长料和大料。这些材料，到手以后，加工费时，很不方便。看来，它们的出路也没有完全解决。
    其实，在原料材料的使用上，大厂和小厂之间是有一段姻缘的：大厂的边料，就是小厂的原料；过去上海有许多小厂是靠大厂过日子的。不过，这种关系是自流的，而且是个别结合的。正因为如此，大厂的边料和小厂的原料都存在着出路之苦。
    广州调查大厂边材废料，有组织有计划地在大厂和小厂之间建立固定的供应关系，这个做法，既为小厂找到了原料来路，也为大厂安排了边材废料的出路。
    在各地大力发展轻工业、增产小百货的时候，原料的来路是宽广的，关键在于加强领导。
