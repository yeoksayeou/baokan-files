Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 6th: According to a TASS report from Athens on July 5th: The Athens newspapers published a letter from Manolis Glezos to Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis.

The Greek national hero and leader of the United Democratic Left Party of Greece, who is about to be tried by a military court, wrote in the letter: "In the days before the trial on July 9, I think it is necessary to say a few words to you, of course, not as a defendant, but as one of the leaders of the largest opposition party.

"On the defendant's seat in the military court, the country's democratic laws are also threatened with execution, because the purpose of this conspiracy is to oppose the country's democratic laws, and I am personally just a victim of this conspiracy."

Glezos then pointed out that no one in Greece believes the absurd rumors of so-called "espionage." Those who are falsely accused of this crime are all recognized patriots. If they have any fault, it is only their irreconcilable opposition to the policies followed by the government, which exposes Greece to the most serious dangers.

The letter said: "If your government wants to try its political opponents, then you should do so straightforwardly. But your regime accuses us of being 'spies,' which will only discredit your regime—not us. … Your government has made a serious mistake, thinking that it can use violence and extraordinary measures to suppress opposing ideas and the fervent demand for a better future."

Glezos wrote: "The people and history will be our judges. As for me, I feel proud and happy that I have dedicated myself to the most sublime ideals of mankind, which gave mankind courage in the heavy years of fighting fascism, and now inspire them to engage in the struggle for peace, democracy and independence."

The letter then pointed out that the spearhead of the upcoming trial is undoubtedly aimed at the unity of Greece. Foreign imperialists and the Greek oligarchs connected with them are doing everything possible to divide the people, create divisions among the people, and subject the solution of the Greek nation's problems to their manipulation and link it to their policies. However, the domestic political development in Greece, the successive elections, and the daily struggles of the people show that the demand for national unity has matured in the mass consciousness, and this demand has aroused a response even among many who stubbornly oppose the left. The court's verdict on anyone cannot obliterate this demand or limit the enthusiastic response to this demand.

The letter said: "If the government attempts to obstruct the growing patriotic cooperation by pinning the crime of 'espionage' on the leaders of the United Democratic Left Party and the leaders of the illegal Greek Communist Party, and believes that this practice will work, then I should honestly tell you that it will not work."

The letter also pointed out that "the upcoming trial is linked to our country's political events. Its purpose is to divert the people's attention from acute issues—bases, food, unemployment, and persecution—as well as to intensify the atmosphere of terror, obstruct the opposition's struggle, and create an excuse for propaganda campaigns against socialist countries, regardless of how enthusiastic the friendly suggestions made by socialist countries to Greece have aroused among the public in our country. These attempts are too obvious everywhere, and they are certainly not feasible."

The letter said: "I should emphasize that the government has the responsibility—even at the last moment—to take measures to restore normalcy, abolish all emergency laws, restore the legal status of the Greek Communist Party, and implement amnesty."

Glezos concluded: "The people who will be sitting on the defendant's seat in the military court on July 9, representing the future of the nation, are now reaching out to all people, believing that now is the time for Greeks to put the interests of the nation above the orders of foreigners and narrow political interests, and unite all forces to benefit our people and strive for universal peace. As for us, no matter how much sacrifice we need to make, we will never stop fulfilling our responsibility to our motherland and people."

### 格列索斯写信给希腊首相  暴力镇压不了对理想的追求  人民和历史将是审判的法官

    格列索斯写信给希腊首相
    暴力镇压不了对理想的追求
    人民和历史将是审判的法官
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社雅典5日讯：雅典报纸登载了曼诺里斯·格列索斯给希腊首相卡拉曼利斯的一封信。
    这位即将受军事法庭审讯的希腊民族英雄、希腊统一民主左翼党领导人在信中写道：“在7月9日审讯的前几天，我认为有必要同你说几句话，当然，不是作为一个被告，而是作为最大的反对党的领导人之一同你说话。
      “在军事法庭的被告席上，国家的民主法律也受到处死的威胁，因为这次阴谋的目的是反对国家的民主法律的，我个人只是这个阴谋的一个受害者。”
    格列索斯接着指出，在希腊任何人都不相信所谓“间谍活动”的无稽之谈。被诬告犯有这种罪行的人们都是公认的爱国者。如果他们有任何过错的话，那只是他们对于政府所遵循的政策的不可调和的反对，而这种政策使希腊暴露在最严重的危险之前。
    信中说：“如果你的政府想审判它的政治上的反对派，那么，你们就应当直截了当地这样做。但是，你的政权控告我们是‘间谍’，这只会使你的政权——而不是我们——名誉扫地。……你的政府犯了一次严重的错误，以为可以用暴力和非常措施来镇压对立的思想和对美好未来的热烈要求。”
    格列索斯写道：“人民和历史将是我们的法官。至于我，我感到骄傲和幸福的是，我把自己献给了人类最崇高的理想，这些理想在同法西斯作战的沉重岁月里给了人类以勇气，而现在又鼓舞他们从事争取和平、民主和独立的斗争。”
    信中接着指出，即将进行的审判的锋芒无疑地是针对着希腊全国的团结的。外国帝国主义和同它们联系的希腊寡头们正在尽一切力量企图分裂人民，在人民中制造分歧，使希腊民族的问题的解决受他们的操纵而同他们的政策联系在一起。但是，希腊国内的政治发展，接连举行的选举和人民每日的斗争表明，争取全国团结的要求在群众意识里已经成熟，这种要求甚至在许多顽固地反对左派的人中间也引起了反应。法庭对任何人进行判决不能把这种要求化为乌有或者限制对这种要求的热烈响应。
    信中说：“如果政府企图用把‘间谍’的罪名扣在统一民主左翼党的领导人和处于非法状态的希腊共产党领导人头上的办法，来达到阻挠日益增长的爱国主义合作的目的，并且相信这种作法是行得通的，那么，我应该老实告诉你，这是不会行得通的。”
    信中还指出，“即将进行的审判是同我国的政治事件相联系的。其目的在于转移人民对尖锐的问题——基地、粮食、失业和迫害问题的注意力，以及加剧恐怖的气氛，阻挠反对派的斗争和为反对社会主义国家的宣传运动制造借口，而不顾社会主义国家对希腊提出的友好的建议在我国的公众中引起了多么热烈的反应。这种企图在任何地方都是太明显了，它们当然是不能实现的。”
    信中说：“我应该强调指出，政府有责任——即使是在最后一刻——采取措施，恢复正常状态，取消一切紧急法，使希腊共产党恢复它的合法地位和实行大赦。”
    格列索斯最后写道：“将在7月9日坐在军事法庭被告席上的、代表民族未来的人们现在向一切人们伸出手来，他们相信，现在是希腊人把民族的利益放在外国人的命令和狭隘的政治利益之上，团结一切力量以造福我国人民和争取普遍和平的时候了。至于我们，无论需要我们付出多大的牺牲，我们也决不停止执行我们对祖国和人民的责任。”
