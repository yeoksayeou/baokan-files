    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 24th. The Yellow River flood peak passed Huayuankou today. When the flood peak reached the Huayuankou station at 00:00 this morning, the flow rate was only 6,000 cubic meters per second. If the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project had not intercepted part of the flood, the flow rate at Huayuankou station would have reached 10,500 cubic meters per second.
    In previous years, when flood peaks appeared in the Yellow River, the water level rose sharply and fell quickly. This time, due to the flood water detained in the Sanmenxia Reservoir being slowly discharged, the water level at Huayuankou station dropped very slowly. By 8:00 this morning, the flow rate at Huayuankou station had only dropped to 5,400 cubic meters per second. The Yellow River's character of violently surging and receding has begun to change.

    三门峡工程使黄水不再暴涨暴落
    黄河洪峰平稳通过花园口
    新华社郑州24日电　黄河洪峰今天过了花园口。当洪峰在今晨零时到达花园口站时，流量只有六千秒立方米。如果没有三门峡水利枢纽工程拦蓄了部分洪水，花园口站的流量要达一万零五百秒立方米。
    往年黄河出现洪峰时，水位上涨得凶猛，下降得也很快。这次由于被拦滞在三门峡水库内的洪水缓缓下泄，花园口站的水位就下落得很慢，到今日上午八时花园口站的流量，只下降到五千四百秒立方米。黄河暴涨暴落的性格已经开始发生变化。
