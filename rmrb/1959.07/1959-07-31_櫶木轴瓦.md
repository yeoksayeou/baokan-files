    Garjan Wood Bushings
    Workers in the section steel workshop of the Guangzhou Tai Chang Steel Rolling Mill have experimented with using garjan wood, a waste material from oil extraction presses, to process into garjan wood bushings to replace the easily worn copper bushings. After ten days of trial rolling, the results are good: after a week of continuous production, the wear rate is still less than one-tenth, and the power consumption is also reduced. At the same time, because the rolling rolls operate better, two to three steel ingots can be rolled simultaneously, the rolling roll hole pattern is not easily deformed, and the output quality is more guaranteed than before.

    櫶木轴瓦
    广州市太昌轧钢厂型钢车间的职工，试用榨油槽废料——櫶木，加工成櫶木轴瓦来代替容易磨损的铜轴瓦。经过十天来试轧，效果良好：连续生产一星期，磨损率仍不到十分之一，电力消耗也少。同时由于轧辊运转较好，二条至三条钢锭同时轧制，轧辊孔型不易变形，产量质量比前更有保证。
