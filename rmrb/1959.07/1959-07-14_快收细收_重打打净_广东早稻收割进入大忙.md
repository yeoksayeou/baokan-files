Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou. Guangdong Province, having overcome the threat of floods, has entered the busy season for early rice harvesting. The province has mobilized three to four million laborers for the summer harvest, and by the 9th, over ten million mu of early rice had been harvested. Hainan Island, with the earliest season, has already harvested over 70%, while the Shantou and Foshan regions in the Pearl River Delta have harvested over half. Zhanjiang and Jiangmen regions have also harvested over 30%, and the Shaoguan region in northern Guangdong, with the latest season, has also begun a comprehensive bumper harvest.

The total early rice planting area in Guangdong Province is approximately 28 million mu. Water conservancy and fertilizer conditions are better than last year, deep plowing and dense planting are mostly reasonable, and transplanting meets seasonal requirements. Therefore, before the floods, early rice grew better than last year in various regions. The floods caused varying degrees of inundation to 6.2 million mu of rice paddies across the province (including 4.8 million mu flooded and the remainder waterlogged), with over 2 million mu suffering losses of 80% or more, even complete loss. Some rice crops were also lodged and sprouted or shed grains due to continuous rainstorms. However, based on the early rice already harvested, the yield per mu of rice that was not flooded is generally slightly higher than last year. Regions with faster harvesting progress have continuously reported numerous large-scale bumper harvests.

Since mid-June, Guangdong experienced continuous heavy rains. After the flood peak, various regions immediately concentrated labor to carry out a large-scale crash harvest. Counties in the Chaoshan Plain, with an earlier harvest season, concentrated 80% of their labor force on crash harvesting, basically completing the harvest in about half a month. In the Foshan region, after the flood-fighting army left the dikes, the labor force投入(tóurù) into drainage and crash harvesting rapidly increased from 350,000 to over 1.4 million, and the harvesting progress surged from over 50,000 mu per day to over 150,000 mu. In Zhongshan, Panyu, Shunde, and Nanhai counties in the Pearl River Delta, where waterlogging was relatively severe, many commune members drained water while rushing to harvest. In some rice paddies with excessive waterlogging, commune members used boats to scoop up and cut the rice from the water. Now, over 60% of the early rice in these three counties has been harvested.

Because a considerable portion of the early rice has been lodged by wind and rain, resulting in grain loss and easy sprouting, various regions have emphasized both quick and careful harvesting. In the rush harvest, communes throughout the province generally ensure gentle cutting and placement, thorough threshing, and the addition of enclosures to grain buckets. They also organize children's grain-picking teams to collect stray grains.

### 快收细收　重打打净  广东早稻收割进入大忙

    快收细收　重打打净
    广东早稻收割进入大忙
    据新华社广州讯　战胜了洪水威胁的广东省，已经进入早稻收割大忙阶段。全省投入夏收的劳动力已达三、四百万人，到9日已收早稻一千万亩以上。季节最早的海南岛已经收了七成多，汕头专区和珠江三角洲的佛山专区已收割过半，湛江、江门两专区也收了30％以上，季节最迟的粤北韶关专区也开始全面丰收。
    广东省全年早稻栽种面积约二千八百万亩，水利、肥料条件比去年好，深翻、密植大部分合理，插秧适合季节要求，因此，在洪水侵袭以前，各地早稻都长得比去年好。洪水的侵袭，全省共有六百二十万亩稻田受到不同程度的淹浸（其中受洪水淹的四百八十万亩，余为内涝渍水浸的），其中失收八成以上以至全部失收的有二百多万亩，还有部分稻禾因连续遭到暴雨袭击而倒伏出芽或掉粒。但是，根据已经收打的部分早稻看，没有受淹的早稻，亩产量一般仍然比去年略高。收打较快的地区已经陆续传出不少大面积丰产捷报。
    广东6月中旬持续大雨，洪峰过后，各地立即集中劳动力，大规模突击抢收。收获季节较早的潮汕平原各县集中了80％的劳动力投入抢收，半个月左右便基本上收刈完毕。佛山专区抗洪大军下堤后，投入排涝抢收的劳力由三十五万迅速增加到一百四十多万，收割进度由每日五万多亩激增到十五万多亩。渍水比较严重的珠江三角洲中山、番顺、南海等县，许多公社社员一面排除渍水，一面突击抢割。部分稻田渍水过深，社员们驾驶着大批小艇，将稻子一把从水里涝割起来。现在，这三个县的早稻也已经收刈了60％以上。
    因为有相当部分早稻受风雨而倒伏、丢粒和容易出芽，因此各地十分强调既要快收又要细收。全省各公社在抢收中一般都做到了轻割轻放、重打打净、谷桶加围，并且组织儿童拾谷队拾谷。
