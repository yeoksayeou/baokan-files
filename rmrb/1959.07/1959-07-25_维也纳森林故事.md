    “Tales from the Vienna Woods”
    Painting by Soviet artist Gan Fu, Poetry by Fei Hua
    News report: The West has dispatched a group of fascist lackeys, ruffians, and prostitutes to Vienna, attempting to "ruin" the festival.
  They are most distressed by others' merriment,
  Trying every possible way to obstruct,
  Refusing visas, throwing people in jail,
  Everything they try—all to no avail.
  Like a cornered dog, their last-ditch effort:
  Sending special agents, prostitutes, and thieves.
  They may lack real talent,
  But garbage and dregs they have in plenty.
  The wolf dressed as grandma, the thief crying "stop thief,"
  "My dear, beware of the flood of savage beasts,
  Communism will devour you!"
  The gentleman opens his bloodthirsty maw. (Attached picture)
    “Don't go to the festival, it's a Communist plot, they want to eat you…”

    “维也纳森林故事”
    苏联甘夫画　飞花　配诗
    报载：西方向维也纳派遣了一批法西斯喽罗、无赖和妓女，企图“搞垮”联欢节。
  人家联欢他最苦恼，
  想尽办法企图阻挠，
  不发签证，抓去坐牢，
  一应俱全——统归无效。
  狗急跳墙最后一着：
  派遣特务妓女小偷。
  要论人才实在缺乏，
  垃圾、渣滓倒样样有。
  狼扮外婆，贼喊捉贼，
  “亲爱的，小心洪水猛兽，
  共产主义要吃掉你！”
  绅士张开血盆大口。（附图片）
    “别去联欢，这是共产党阴谋，他们要吃掉你……”
