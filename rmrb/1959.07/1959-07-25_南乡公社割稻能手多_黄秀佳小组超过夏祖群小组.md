　　Nanxiang Commune has many rice-cutting experts.
　　Huang Xiujia's group surpasses Xia Zuqun's group.
　　(Our dispatch) In the over-contract production movement, the Huang Xiujia group of three people from the Shangdukoushengchan (Upper Ferry Production) Team of Nanxiang Brigade, Nanxiang Commune, Heng County, Guangxi, created a new record of cutting 2.14 mu per person per day, surpassing the Xia Zuqun group (see this newspaper's July 24th edition).
　　On July 13th, 261 people (78% of the total agricultural labor force) from the entire brigade signed up to participate in the pacesetter and expert competition. That morning, as soon as it dawned, commune members rushed to the fields and worked at twice their usual speed. At noon, cadres went around urging them to rest, and only then did the commune members leave the fields to rest. The Shang Xiuzhen transplanting group, which separated from the Xia Zuqun group, saw that the Li Shaoying transplanting group was transplanting faster than them, and refused to rest, finally surpassing the Li Shaoying group after 2:00 p.m. The results of the competition that day showed that the three members of the Huang Xiujia group created the highest record, averaging 2.14 mu of rice cut per person.
　　The next day's statistics showed that all 1,445 mu of early rice fields in the entire brigade that were ripe had been harvested, totaling more than 1,200 mu; 897 mu were plowed and harrowed, and 128.25 mu of late rice seedlings were transplanted. It is estimated that the entire brigade's summer harvest and summer planting can be completed by July 25th (fifteen days before the Beginning of Autumn). During the competition, the quality of all tasks could be guaranteed. On the 13th, an inspection of one fen of rice fields cut by the Huang Xiujia pacesetter group revealed only five ears of grain had been missed.
　　Currently, the competition upsurge in the Nanxiang Brigade is still continuing. After each competition, there is a short period of rest, during which preparations are made for the next competition. Therefore, the commune members are always in high spirits and good health.

    南乡公社割稻能手多
    黄秀佳小组超过夏祖群小组
    本报讯　广西横县南乡公社南乡大队在超包产运动中，上渡口生产队黄秀佳小组三人，创造每人日割二亩一分四厘的新纪录，超过了夏祖群小组（见24日本版）。
    7月13日，全大队二百六十一人（占参加农业总劳动力的78％）报名参加标兵能手竞赛。这天早晨天一亮，社员就赶到田里，用比平日加倍的速度干活；中午，干部四出劝告，社员们才离田休息。从夏祖群小组分出来的商秀珍插秧组，见李少英插秧组插得比自己快，说什么也不肯休息，终于在下午两点多钟，超过了李少英组。这天的竞赛结果，黄秀佳小组三人创造最高纪录，平均每人割禾二亩一分四厘。
    第二天统计，全大队一千四百四十五亩早稻田，黄熟的已全部割完，共计割了一千二百余亩；犁耙八百九十七亩，插晚稻秧一百二十八亩四分一厘。预计全大队夏收夏种可在7月25日（即立秋前十五天）完成。在竞赛中，各项工作都能保证质量。13日检查黄秀佳标兵组割的一分禾田，只发现漏掉五穗谷。
    目前，南乡大队的竞赛高潮还在继续中。每一次竞赛之后，都有一个短时间的休息，在休息期间作好下一次竞赛的准备。因此，社员们始终情绪饱满，身体健康。
