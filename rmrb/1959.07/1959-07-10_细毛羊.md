Small Information

    Fine Wool Sheep
    Improving ordinary sheep with fine wool sheep (Xinjiang fine wool sheep, Merino sheep, Caucasian sheep, etc.) can transform China's sheep with low wool yield and coarse wool quality into fine wool sheep with high wool yield and fine wool quality.
    Ordinary Chinese sheep produce about two "shi jin" of wool per year. The wool yield of the first generation of improved sheep can generally reach four "shi jin"; the wool yield of the second generation of sheep can reach five or six "shi jin". The wool yield of improved sheep is one to two times higher than that of ordinary sheep.
    Unimproved sheep have coarse wool that cannot be used in the wool textile industry. The wool of improved sheep is fine. The fineness of the wool of second-generation and higher improved sheep can generally reach 60 count yarn, which basically meets the requirements of the wool textile industry.

    细毛羊
    用细毛羊（新疆细毛羊、美利奴羊、高加索羊等）改良普通绵羊，可以把我国产毛量低、毛质粗劣的绵羊，变成产毛量高、毛质纤细的细毛羊。
    我国普通绵羊每只每年产毛二市斤左右。经过改良的一代绵羊的产毛量，一般可以达到四市斤；二代绵羊的产毛量可以达到五、六市斤。改良绵羊的产毛量比普通绵羊多一倍到两倍。
    没有改良的绵羊，毛质粗，不能用于毛纺织工业。改良绵羊的羊毛纤细，二代以上改良羊的羊毛的细度，一般可以达到六十支纱，基本上符合毛纺织工业的要求。
