Xinhua News Agency, July 8th, Moscow dispatch: The successful launch of a single-stage geophysical ballistic rocket by the Soviet Union has become the focus of attention for newspapers around the world. Foreign news agencies, radio stations, and television stations have treated TASS's news about the rocket launch as top priority news. Newspapers widely commented that this is a new and outstanding achievement of Soviet science.

The German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland" emphasized that the successful launch of the ballistic rocket is a remarkable achievement of Soviet scientists.

Poland's "People's Tribune" wrote that sending animals into high altitude and their successful return to Earth is not only an achievement of Soviet science, but also brings the day closer when mankind will master outer space.

France's "France-Soir" wrote in a commentary, "This is a sensational event." This rocket must have a very powerful and sophisticated engine. The newspaper pointed out that the Americans cannot yet build such a rocket. "France-Soir" emphasized that a single-stage intermediate-range rocket is noteworthy because it is less complex and dangerous than multi-stage rockets when carrying humans into outer space. Its characteristic is very reliable.

Italy's "l'Unità" pointed out that the new significant achievement lies not only in the fact that the Soviet rocket has a large effective payload, but also in the ability to bring this huge weight back to Earth.

Xinhua News Agency, July 8th, TASS dispatch: The unprecedented weight and the complexity of the investigation tasks are some of the characteristics of the single-stage high-altitude rocket launched by the Soviet Union on July 2nd. Soviet scientists expressed their opinions to TASS reporters on this issue.

Mikhailov, Director of the Pulkovo Observatory of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Astronomical Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that the unprecedented total weight of scientific instruments and experimental animals, exceeding two tons, is a feature of this new experiment. The safe landing of animals and scientific instruments is of great significance to science, proving that in the near future it will be possible to obtain containers with scientific instruments and data from satellites. At the same time, this is very important for creating conditions for humans to fly into the universe in the future.

Dubrotin, Deputy Director of the Physics Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, believes that the rocket launched this time is remarkable in many ways. First of all, the complexity of the scientific tasks it undertakes is very striking. It closely combines some of the most pressing issues in modern physics, astronomy, biology, and medicine.

    各国舆论评苏联高空火箭杰出成就
    载重空前　考察广泛　安全可靠
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最近发射的一级地球物理弹道火箭成功的消息已成为世界各国报纸注意的中心。外国通讯社、电台和电视台都把塔斯社关于发射火箭的消息视为头等重要的新闻。报纸广泛评论，认为这是苏联科学新的杰出的成就。
    德意志民主共和国的“新德意志报”着重指出，弹道火箭发射成功是苏联科学家的卓越功勋。
    波兰“人民论坛报”写道，动物升入高空以及它们顺利地回到地球上来，这不仅是苏联科学的成就，而且使人类掌握宇宙空间的日子更加临近了。
    法国“法兰西晚报”在评论中写道，“这是轰动一时的事件”。这个火箭一定有非常强大和完善的发动机。报纸指出，美国人还不能制造这种火箭。“法兰西晚报”强调指出，一级中程火箭之所以值得注意，还因为，这种火箭在把人带上宇宙空间时，没有多级火箭那么复杂和危险。它的特点是非常可靠。
    意大利“团结报”指出，新的重大成就不仅在于苏联的火箭具有很大的有效荷重，而且还在于，能够使这种巨大的重量回到地球上来。
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社报道：重量的空前巨大、考察任务的复杂等是苏联7月2日所发射一级高空火箭的一些特点。苏联科学家就这问题向塔斯社记者发表了自己的意见。
    苏联普尔科沃天文台台长、苏联科学院天文学委员会主席米哈伊洛夫说，科学仪器和试验动物的总重量空前地达到两吨以上，这是这次新试验的特点。动物和科学仪器能够安全着陆，这对科学有重大的意义，它证明在最近的将来可能从卫星上得到带有科学仪器和资料的容器了。同时，这对于为人将来飞向宇宙创造条件来说，也是十分重要的。
    苏联科学院物理研究所副所长杜勃洛京认为，这次发射的火箭在很多方面都是卓越的。首先，它所担负的科学任务的复杂性是十分引人注意的。它把现代物理学、天文学、生物学和医学中最迫切的一些问题都紧密地结合在一起了。
