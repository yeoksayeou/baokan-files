A Dazzling Array of New Products

Double-Lid Thermos

When two people go out for a picnic, they have to bring a thermos and two cups. The Shanghai Yong Sheng Thermos Factory recently produced a double-lid travel thermos that solves this problem.

This thermos has two plastic lids, one large and one small. When the large one is screwed on tight, the small one cannot fall out; when turned over, both lids can be used to pour water and drink. This thermos has two sets of handles. The upper part of the bottle shell has a transparent plastic strap that can be carried on the body. If used at home, the strap can be removed; the thermos also has two iron rings, like butterflies attached to the bottle body, which can be turned over to act as a handle like an ordinary thermos.

Yong Sheng Factory successfully trial-produced several new types of thermos flasks in the first half of this year. There is also a small thermos shaped like a penguin, which can be used to hold milk and other beverages. With a simple press of the hand, the penguin's beak will open. Shanghai Yong Sheng Thermos Factory workers are manufacturing double-lid thermos flasks.Seamless Leather Shoes

Making leather shoes requires nails and stitching, which is well known. The Shanghai Leather Shoe Factory is now adopting a new method: like rubber shoes, the shoes are glued together. Leather shoes made in this way have no stitching, making them beautiful and elegant. Some stitched leather shoes have exposed threads that wear out over time, causing the soles to come apart. Glued leather shoes do not have this drawback. These shoes also feel light and fit snugly. Using this method to make leather shoes eliminates many original tasks such as cutting seams, pulling seams, and sewing on the sole, increasing production efficiency by one to two times and reducing costs.

135 Film

After the Shanghai Photosensitive Photographic Materials Factory produced 120 film last year, many people wrote to ask: When will 135 film, used in Leica cameras, be produced domestically? Now, people's wishes have been realized.

135 film has higher requirements than 120 film. After the Shanghai Photosensitive Photographic Materials Factory produced 135 film, it was given to many Shanghai photojournalists for trial use, and its performance was proven to be very good. The grain is very fine, and it remains clear even when enlarged significantly.

The factory is now also working to manufacture motion picture film.

Elastic Soccer Socks

Athletes sweat a lot when running on the field. Socks sticking to the feet can be uncomfortable. The Shanghai Jiangnan Socks Factory recently designed a new type of soccer sock specifically for athletes in preparation for the National Games.

These socks are woven from five strands of 21-count single yarn, making them very thick. They are very elastic, and even if you sweat a lot while wearing them, the socks will absorb the sweat, preventing them from sticking to your shoes. The colors of the socks are also bright, with each side of the athletes wearing a different color, making them easily distinguishable from the stands.

Sunscreen Cream

The Shanghai Family Industry Cooperative, which specializes in producing various daily-use cosmetics, conducted an interesting experiment a few days ago. A person applied a type of cream to their hand and then exposed it to ultraviolet light. After a while, the area where the cream was not applied became red and dark, and did not fade for a long time. The area where the cream was applied was only slightly red and faded quickly. This cream is a new product they have developed—sunscreen cream. This cream can block some of the excessive ultraviolet light, preventing it from damaging the skin. This cream also has a fragrant scent.

Sunscreen cream, like toothpaste, is packaged in a tin tube and can be carried around. It can be applied during long trips and swimming.

    琳琅满目的新产品
    双盖热水瓶
    两个人出门游山玩水，带上一个热水瓶，还得带上两个茶杯。上海永生热水瓶厂最近生产的一种双盖旅行热水瓶，把这个问题解决了。
    这种热水瓶上有大小两个塑料盖，大的旋紧，里面的小的就掉不出来；翻过来，两个盖都可以倒水喝。这种热水瓶上有两套提手。瓶壳上部有一根透明的塑料带，可以背在身上。如果在家里使用，带子可以拿掉；热水瓶上还有两个铁环，像蝴蝶一样贴在瓶身上，扳过来就像普通热水瓶的柄。
    永生厂今年上半年试制成功了好几种新式热水瓶。还有一种外形像企鹅的小型热水瓶，可以用来盛放牛奶等饮料。只要用手一揿，鹅嘴就会张开。上海永生热水瓶厂工人在制造双盖热水瓶没用线缝的皮鞋
    做皮鞋要钉钉缝线，这是人所熟知的事情。上海皮鞋厂现在采取一种新办法：像橡胶鞋一样，用胶水把鞋子胶牢。这样做成的皮鞋没有线缝，美观大方。有些缝制的皮鞋因为线露在外面，穿久了，线磨断了，鞋底会脱开，用胶水粘的皮鞋就没有这种缺点。这种鞋子穿起来还使人感到灵巧，贴脚。用这种办法做皮鞋，原来在底掌上剪缝、拉缝、缝线等许多工作都省掉了，生产效率比过去提高一倍到两倍，成本也降低了。
    135胶卷
    上海感光照像材料厂去年制成120胶卷以后，许多人写信去问：莱卡照相机上用的135胶卷，国内什么时候才可以生产？现在，人们这个愿望实现了。
    135胶卷比120胶卷要求较高。上海感光照像材料厂制成135胶卷以后，曾经让上海许多摄影记者拿去试用，证明性能很好。颗粒很细，放得很大也不模糊。
    现在，这个厂还在设法制造电影胶片。
    弹力球袜
    运动员在球场上奔跑，要出许多汗。袜子粘在脚上，会感到不舒服。上海江南袜厂最近为迎接全国运动会，专门给运动员们设计了一种新球袜。
    这种球袜是用五根二十一支单纯纱并在一起织成的，摸起来非常厚实。它弹力很足，穿在脚上，尽管汗出得很多，也会吸掉，不至于粘住鞋。袜子颜色也鲜艳，双方运动员各穿一种花色，坐在很远的看台上也能辨别。
    防晒膏
    专门生产各种日用化妆品的上海家庭工业社里，前些日子做了一次有趣的试验。一个人把一种油膏搽在手上，然后去照紫外线，过了一会，没有搽油膏的地方，又红又黑，久久不退，搽过油膏的地方，只有一点红，而且很快就退掉。这油膏就是他们新制成的一种新产品——防晒膏。这种油膏可以把一部分过多的紫外线挡住，不让它损伤人的皮肤。这种油膏还有一股芬芳的香味。
    防晒膏和牙膏一样，装在锡管里，可以随身携带。长途旅行、游泳都可以搽用。
