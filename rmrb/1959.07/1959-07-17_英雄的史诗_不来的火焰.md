	Heroic Epic - The Flame That Won't Die Out
	Zu Cun
	The Greek reactionary government's trial and persecution of Glezos and other Greek patriots is yet another attack on the entire democratic and progressive forces of Greece.

	Glezos' name, and his unwavering struggle for more than a decade, are linked to the heroic epic written in blood by millions of good sons and daughters of the Greek people.

	I

	In 1941, Hitler's Germany, rampant in Europe, occupied Greece. The entire European continent was shrouded in fascist terror. Under Hitler's iron heel, under the heinous swastika, many European dignitaries, princes and nobles fled in panic, or knelt and surrendered. King George II of Greece and his reactionary government also abandoned the people and fled to London. But like the unyielding people of Europe, the Greek people raised the banner of independence and freedom and rose up to resist. Glezos' heroic act of climbing the Acropolis in Athens and tearing down the swastika fully demonstrated the fearless spirit of the Greek people. Under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, the flames of the Greek guerrilla war burned everywhere, and then merged into a unified People's Liberation Army. The brutal fascist occupation forces suffered repeated setbacks in the face of the unyielding people of this small country. By the summer of 1943, about one-third of Greece's territory had been liberated. When the Soviet army swept through Hitler's bandit troops in Southeastern Europe, the Greek People's Liberation Army coordinated the counter-offensive and finally liberated the entire country in October 1944, regaining the honor and freedom of the motherland.

	Who is not moved by the heroic deeds of the Greek people, who does not sing praises of the glorious achievements of the Greek people?

	II

	But the liberation of the motherland, which the Greek people had bought with a great deal of blood, was immediately attacked by wolfish British imperialism. General Scobie replaced the Nazi general, the Union Jack replaced the swastika, and with the support of their bayonets, the reactionary Greek royalists staged a comeback and seized power. The brutality of the "civilized" British occupation army was almost no less than that of the Nazis. The massacre they carried out in Athens in December 1944 shocked the world, and the blood of 76,000 Greeks stained the streets of Athens red.

	However, facing the powerful people's armed forces, it was not easy for them to swallow the fruits of the people's victory. They miscalculated for a time, underestimated the power of the people, and openly ordered the disbandment of the People's Liberation Army. The Greek people answered them with resolute resistance. So, they resorted to political conspiracies. In February 1945, the royalist fascist government, under the auspices of British imperialism, put on a false face of peace and democracy and signed the so-called Varkiza Agreement with the National Liberation Front to end the civil war, promising to carry out democratic reforms. But before the ink was dry, the Anglo-Greek reactionaries reneged on the agreement. The British occupation army dispatched a large number of instructors, allocated a large number of new-style weapons, trained and equipped the royalist army, and in 1946, they staged a fraudulent election farce, allowing George II to retake the "throne." Immediately, secret agents were everywhere, concentration camps stood tall, and the most frenzied suppression of the democratic and progressive forces began.

	The Anglo-Greek reactionaries thought that once the people laid down their arms, they would become a group of desperate lambs to be slaughtered. Such an assessment is so unrealistic for the heroic Greek people! The Greek people took up arms again. In October 1946, the Democratic Army was born, and a part of Greece was again liberated from the hands of foreign occupiers and traitors. The Greek people wrote another new and indelible page in history for the independence and freedom of their motherland.

	With the support and endorsement of the people, the Greek Democratic Army repelled multiple joint offensives by the Anglo-Greek reactionaries. The heroic struggle of the Greek people exhausted the British Empire, which was scarred by war and relied on more than $3.7 billion in "aid" to catch its breath. The British economic capacity could hardly bear the heavy burden of the intervention war. From January 1946 to March 1947 alone, Britain gave the Greek reactionary government "aid" amounting to around 40 million pounds. But Britain was unwilling to give up Greece as a strategic stronghold, so it begged Washington for help. Britain maintained 5,000 occupation troops in Greece, while handing over the intervention war to the United States to carry on. A despicable and bloody transaction was quickly completed between London and Washington.

	III

	The U.S. imperialists, eager to expand globally, immediately intervened, waving the infamous banner of the "Truman Doctrine." On the one hand, they provided the Greek reactionaries with $300 million in loans and munitions; on the other hand, they dispatched a large "military advisory group" to Greece and established a "U.S.-Greek Joint Staff Headquarters for the Army, Navy, and Air Force," headed by an American general as chief of staff, replacing the British army in directly commanding the intervention war. Thus, one campaign after another, even more cruel and larger in scale, was launched to attack the Greek Democratic Army. After the "Spring Offensive" of 1947 was crushed, at the beginning of 1948, a major offensive, carefully planned to "completely eliminate" the Democratic Army, was launched. In June of the same year, the Greek royalist fascist government, under the personal command of American General Van Fleet, mobilized more than one-third of its entire army, equipped with American aircraft, artillery, tanks, and flamethrowers—100,000 troops—to launch an even more fierce offensive against the Grammos Mountains in northwestern Greece (an important base area of the Democratic Army).

	The Greek Democratic Army was in an absolutely inferior position in terms of troop strength and equipment. Coupled with the enemy's tight blockade, they had to deal with the continuous offensives of the powerful enemy under extremely difficult conditions. 80% of the Democratic Army soldiers had no boots, and more than 70% had no coats to keep out the cold (in the winter mountains, the temperature sometimes dropped to minus 30 degrees Celsius). Their food was mainly cornbread, and sometimes they could not eat a bit of oil or salt for the entire month. Their weapons were pieced together, Italian, German, British, and American-style, mainly rifles, with very few machine guns and a few small cannons. Many foreign journalists admitted that if the Democratic Army had only a quarter of the equipment of the royalist army, they could have won a complete victory long ago.

	Even so, the Greek Democratic Army persisted in fierce fighting for more than three years. In December 1947, they established a provisional democratic government—the first people's democratic government in Greek history—as a resounding response to the U.S. imperialists' vicious intervention. Under the leadership of the provisional democratic government, the Greek Democratic Army was divided into eight war zones to fight the enemy. In one of the most severe battles in June 1948, although the Democratic Army had to concentrate its main force, it still persisted in seventy days of hard fighting, eliminating more than 20,000 enemy troops. In June 1949, the Greek Democratic Army re-liberated the entire Grammos Mountains area.

	The heroic sons and daughters of the Greek people, in the People's Liberation War, were filled with a fearless spirit of loyalty to the motherland and loyalty to the people, and revolutionary optimism.

	Soviet journalist Smirnov, in an article called "The Great Terror in Greece" about the Greek reactionaries' massacre of patriots in the autumn of 1949, transcribed some of the touching last letters of the soldiers.

	A soldier, Youth League member Demetrios Komninos, wrote to his comrades: "I fell fighting for the people, and I feel honored. May my death turn into a bright beacon in the Greek people's struggle for victory, illuminating the road for you. Dedicate all your careers and thoughts to our struggle, and move forward forever!"

	Another soldier, Youth League member Spyridon Rezzokotas, wrote to his mother: "Dear mother, I send you my last letter and my last wish: do not cry or be sad. I want you to be proud of your son, hold your head high. In a few hours, I will die. I treat death as the last battle under the banner of freedom for which millions of people have sacrificed. I am not discouraged, even though we only have a few hours to live. We are now singing our songs for the last time."

	What noble qualities, what a powerful appeal! They are immortal.

	IV

	Yes, the Greek people were not overwhelmed by the U.S. and British imperialist interventionists and domestic reactionaries. Although they were forced to stop armed struggle, they are still holding high the banner of freedom—the banner that Glezos raised on the Acropolis in Athens—and continuing to move forward. The significant victory of the left-wing democratic forces in the May 1958 election is proof of this. This victory alarmed the Greek reactionaries, because this victory was a powerful protest against the Greek reactionary policies.

	In recent years, the Greek reactionary government has pursued a policy of following the United States in its foreign affairs. It has joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, signed the "U.S.-Greek Military Agreement," and allowed the United States to turn many of Greece's ports, especially Rhodes and Crete, into U.S. military bases. Not long ago, under U.S. pressure, it even signed a humiliating agreement with Britain and Turkey selling out Cyprus, and brazenly agreed to the United States establishing missile bases on Greek territory. At the same time, the Greek reactionary government continues to cruelly persecute the democratic and progressive forces, arresting and imprisoning or executing large numbers of patriots every year. Greece still practices a barbaric exile system, arbitrarily depriving patriots of their freedom based on information from the "Security Committee," or even based on the "Security Committee's" suspicion of citizens' socio-political activities and beliefs, and exiling them to desolate islands.

	The exiles on the island of Youra, in their book "Youra," exposed the shocking exile system. On this island of Youra in the Aegean Sea, with an area of only twenty-eight square kilometers, the island is attacked by gales all year round, there is no fresh water, no soil, no grass or trees, only bare cliffs and salt water. Every day from dawn to dusk, five or six hundred "prisoners" work in the dust, trying to level a "dirt mountain." Everywhere is a cacophony of whistles, shouts, and screams. Leather whips lash against scarred backs, and even break apart. Bodies are so hot they are about to melt, and the rocks feel like they're on fire. The wells are all dry. The only bit of water left is used exclusively by the gendarmes. They use the water to wet the ground to prevent dust from flying, but at the same time, ten thousand "prisoners" are parched by the seawater, unable to get even a cup of fresh water to moisten their lips. "Prisoners" fell one by one.

	The farcical persecution of patriots such as Glezos that is happening now is already commonplace. The 1951-1952 persecution of the Beloyannis case is one of thousands of examples of cruel persecution. Under the direction of U.S. Ambassador to Greece, Peeleffer, the Athens military court tried Beloyannis and 93 other patriots, and sentenced them to death on fabricated charges of "engaging in subversive activities." At that time, due to protests from peace-loving people around the world, the Greek government was forced to announce that the sentence would "not be carried out." But under U.S. pressure, in February 1952, the Greek government again falsely accused Beloyannis, who had been imprisoned since 1950, of engaging in so-called espionage activities in 1951, illegally concealing a transmitter, and, citing Article 375 of the law regarding "espionage" and "treason," sentenced them to death.

	Greece has become a large prison built abroad by U.S. and British imperialism, but it has also erected a noose that strangles their own necks. Every crime committed by the Greek reactionary government in persecuting the democratic and progressive forces does not indicate their strength; on the contrary, it can only show that they are on the crater of a volcano that is about to erupt again. The magnificent movement at home and abroad in Greece to support Glezos is enough to make the enemies of independence and freedom lose heart.

	The flames of the Greek people's struggle for independence and freedom will burn more and more fiercely, and their world-renowned heroic epic will never be erased. (Attached pictures)

	From the face of this coal miner, you can see the Greek people's unwavering will.

	In the Averoff prison in Athens, more than 600 heroic sons and daughters of the Greek people—peace and democratic fighters—have been imprisoned for many years. Day after day, their relatives crowd at the prison gate, hoping to have a chance to see them.

    英雄的史诗  不来的火焰
    祖存
    希腊反动政府对格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者的审讯和迫害，是对希腊整个民主进步力量的又一次进攻。
    格列索斯的名字，和他的十余年如一日的不屈斗争，是同希腊人民的千百万好儿女用自己鲜血写下的英雄史诗联系在一起的。
    一
    1941年，横行欧洲的希特勒德国占领了希腊。整个欧洲大陆笼罩在法西斯恐怖之中。在希特勒的铁蹄下，在万恶的卐字旗下，欧洲多少达官显贵、王公侯爵望风而逃，或屈膝投降。希腊的国王乔治二世和他的反动政府也抛弃了人民，流亡伦敦。但正像欧洲不屈的人民一样，希腊人民高举起独立自由的旗帜，奋起抗战。格列索斯登上雅典城堡撕下卐字旗的英雄气概，充分表现了希腊人民的大无畏精神。在民族解放阵线的领导下，希腊游击战争的火焰到处燃烧，然后联成一片，组成了统一的人民解放军。强暴的法西斯占领军，在这个小国的不屈的人民面前，连遭挫折。到了1943年的夏天，希腊约三分之一的领土获得了解放。当苏军在东南欧扫荡希特勒匪军的时候，希腊人民解放军策应反攻，终于在1944年10月解放了全国，夺回了祖国的荣誉和自由。
    谁不为希腊人民的英雄行为所感动，谁不歌颂希腊人民的辉煌功绩。
    二
    但希腊人民用大量鲜血换来的祖国的解放，立刻受到了豺狼般的英帝国主义的进攻。斯科比将军代替了纳粹将军，＊字旗代替了卐字旗，在他们的刺刀的支持下，反动的希腊保皇派卷土重来，窃取了政权。“文明”的英国占领军的残暴，几乎不逊于纳粹。1944年12月，他们在雅典的大屠杀，轰动世界，七万六千希腊人的鲜血染红了雅典街头。
    可是，他们面对着强大的人民武装，要想咽下人民的胜利果实，谈何容易。他们一度打错了算盘，低估了人民的力量，公然下令解散人民解放军。希腊人民回答他们的是：坚决的反击。于是，他们玩弄政治阴谋。1945年2月保皇法西斯政府，在英帝国主义的牵线下，装扮和平民主的假面孔，同民族解放阵线签订所谓停止内战的瓦尔基兹协定，答应进行民主改革。但墨迹未干，英希反动派就背弃了协定。英国占领军派遣大批的教官，拨出大量的新式武器，训练和配备保皇军，并在1946年导演了伪选丑剧，使乔治二世重登“宝座”，顿时特务密布，集中营林立，开始了对民主进步力量的最疯狂的镇压。
    英希反动派以为：人民一旦放下了武器，就会成为一群绝望的待宰羔羊。这种估计，对于英雄的希腊人民，是何等的不现实！希腊人民重新拿起了武器。1946年10月，民主军诞生了，希腊一部分国土又从外国占领者和卖国贼手中解放出来了。希腊人民为祖国的独立自由写下了又一新的永不磨灭的史页。
    希腊民主军在人民的支持和拥护下，击退了多次的英希反动派的联合进攻。希腊人民的英勇斗争，使满身战争创伤、依靠三十七亿多美元“援助”喘息的大英帝国，疲于奔命。英国的经济能力难于负担干涉战争的重荷。仅1946年1月到1947年3月，英国给予希腊反动政府的“援助”就巨达四千万英镑左右。但英国决不愿放弃希腊这个战略据点，它向华盛顿乞援。英国保持五千名在希腊的占领军，而把干涉战争交给美国进行下去。一个卑鄙的、血腥的交易，在伦敦和华盛顿之间迅速完成了。
    三
    急于向全球扩张的美帝国主义，立即插手进来，打着臭名远扬的“杜鲁门主义”的旗号，一面提供三亿美元的贷款和军火给希腊反动派，一面派遣庞大的“军事顾问团”到希腊，设立了由美国将军担任参谋长的“美希陆海空军联合参谋部”，取代英军直接指挥干涉战争。于是，更残酷更大规模地进攻希腊民主军的战役，一个接一个地进行着。1947年的“春季攻势”被粉碎后，在1948年初展开了经过周密部署的企图“彻底消灭”民主军的大攻势。同年6月，希腊保皇法西斯政府又倾其全部军队的三分之一以上、配备美国飞机、大炮、坦克和火焰放射器的十万军队，在美国将军范佛里特的亲自指挥下，向希腊西北部的格拉姆斯山区（民主军的重要根据地）发动更猛烈的进攻。
    希腊民主军在兵力和装备方面都处于绝对的劣势，加上敌人严密的封锁，他们不能不在极端困难的条件下对付强大敌人的不断进攻。民主军的战士80％没有靴子，70％以上没有外套御寒（在冬季山区温度有时降至零下三十度）。他们的食物，主要是包谷饼，有时整个月吃不到一点油盐。武器是七拼八凑的，有意大利式、德国式、英国式和美国式的，主要是步枪，很少一点机关枪和几门小炮。很多外国记者承认：只要民主军拥有保皇军的四分之一的装备，他们早就可以获得完全的胜利。
    虽然如此，希腊民主军坚持了三年多的剧烈战斗。他们在1947年12月成立了临时民主政府——希腊历史上第一个人民的民主的政府，作为对美帝国主义凶恶干涉的一个响亮的回答。在临时民主政府的领导下，希腊民主军分成了八个战区，迎击敌人。在1948年6月的一次最严重的战斗中，民主军虽然不得不把主力转移集中，但仍坚持了七十天苦战，歼敌两万多人。1949年6月希腊民主军又重新解放了全部这个格拉姆斯山区。
    希腊人民的英雄儿女，在人民解放战争中，充满了忠于祖国、忠于人民的大无畏精神和革命的乐观主义。
    苏联记者斯米诺夫在一篇叫做“希腊大恐怖”的、关于1949年秋希腊反动派屠杀爱国人士的通讯中，抄录了一些战士们可歌可泣的遗书。
    一个战士、青年团员德米特雷奥·科姆尼诺斯给战友们这样写道：“我为人民战斗倒下了，我感到光荣。但愿我的死亡，能在希腊人民为争取胜利而进行的斗争中化为明亮的烽火，为你们照亮道路。把你们全部事业和思想贡献给我们的斗争，并永远前进！”
    又一个战士、青年团员斯庇雷东·雷佐科塔斯写给母亲的信说：“亲爱的母亲，我寄给你最后的信和最后的愿望：不要哀哭或悲伤。我希望你以你的儿子为荣，高昂起你的头，几个钟头以后，我就要死了。我把死当作千百万人民为它而牺牲的自由旗帜之下的最后战斗。我并不沮丧，虽然我们只有几个钟点可活了。我们现在正在最后一次唱我们的歌。”
    这是多么崇高的品质，多么强大的感召力！他们永垂不朽。
    四
    是的，希腊人民并没有被美英帝国主义干涉者和国内反动派所压倒。他们虽然被迫停止武装斗争，但他们仍然在高举着自由的旗帜——格列索斯当年在雅典城堡升起的旗帜，继续前进。1958年5月大选中，左翼民主力量所得的重大胜利，就是一个证明。这个胜利使希腊反动派惊惶失措，因为这个胜利是对希腊反动政策的有力抗议。
    近几年来，希腊反动政府对外执行追随美国的政策。它加入了北大西洋公约集团，签订了“希美军事协定”，让美国把希腊的许多港口，特别是罗特岛和克里特岛成为美国的军事基地。不久前它竟在美国压力下，同英、土签订了出卖塞浦路斯的屈辱性协定，并悍然同意美国在希腊领土上建立导弹基地。同时，希腊反动政府继续残酷地迫害民主进步力量，每年都要逮捕大批的爱国者，把他们下狱和处死。希腊至今仍实行着野蛮的流放制度，随意根据“安全委员会”的情报，或者甚至依据“安全委员会”对公民的社会政治活动和信仰的怀疑，就剥夺爱国者的自由，把他们流放到荒漠的岛屿上去。
    犹拉岛上的流放者在他们所写的“犹拉”一书中，揭露了骇人听闻的流放制度。在这个爱琴海中、面积只有二十八平方公里的犹拉岛上，一年四季都遭到狂风袭击，没有淡水，没有泥土，没有草木，只有光秃秃的悬岩和咸水。每天从天刚亮到天黑，五六百个“犯人”在尘土飞扬中工作，要把一座“土山”挖平。到处是一片哨声、喊声、尖叫声。皮棍打在伤痕斑斑的背脊上，皮棍都折断了。身体热得要溶化了，岩石如火烧一般。井里都干涸了。仅剩下的一点点水也被宪兵们独自用了。他们拿水来泼地，以免尘土飞扬，可是就在这时候，一万个“犯人”被海水弄得唇焦舌燥，想有一杯淡水润润嘴唇也得不到。“犯人”一个一个地倒了下去。
    像现在这样迫害格列索斯等爱国者的丑剧，也早已司空见惯。1951—1952年迫害贝劳扬尼斯案件，就是千百件残酷的迫害例证之一。雅典军事法庭在美国驻希腊大使普里弗指使下，审讯贝劳扬尼斯等九十三位爱国者，并以“从事颠复活动”的捏造罪名把他们判处死刑。当时由于世界爱好和平人士的抗议，希腊政府被迫宣布这个判决“不予执行”。但在美国压力下，1952年2月希腊政府又诬告1950年入狱的贝劳扬尼斯等在1951年从事所谓间谍活动，非法暗藏发报机，援引第三百七十五条法律关于“间谍罪”和“叛国罪”的规定，将他们判处死刑。
    希腊已成为美英帝国主义在国外建立的大牢狱，但也架起了绞住他们自己的脖子的绞架。希腊反动政府迫害民主进步力量的每一罪行，并不说明它们的强大，相反地，这只能说明他们是处在将要再一次喷射溶岩的火山口上。希腊国内外声援格列索斯的运动波澜壮阔，就足使独立自由的敌人为之丧胆。
    希腊人民争取独立自由的斗争火焰会越烧越炽烈，他们传颂世界的英雄史诗永不磨灭。（附图片）
    从这个煤矿工人的脸上可以看到希腊人民永不屈服的意志。
    在雅典的阿维罗夫监狱里，长年关禁着六百多名希腊人民的英雄儿女——和平民主的战士，他们的亲人日复一日地挤在监狱门口，希望能得着见一面的机缘。
