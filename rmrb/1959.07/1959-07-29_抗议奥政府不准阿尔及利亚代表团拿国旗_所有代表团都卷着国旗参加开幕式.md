Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, July 27th: The International Committee of the 7th World Youth Festival held a press conference on the 27th. The Chairman of the International Committee and President of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Bernini, delivered a speech at the meeting. He said that the opening ceremony of the festival held on the 26th achieved amazing success. It embodied the powerful strength and vigorous spirit of young people around the world, and also fully demonstrated the sincerity and enthusiasm of the Austrian people and youth for the festival. Contrary to the expectations and actions of some people, the Austrian people were unwilling to remain "silent" about the festival.

Bernini then explained why the delegations of various countries did not unfurl their national flags at the opening ceremony of the festival. He said that on the eve of the opening ceremony, the Austrian authorities demanded that the Algerian delegation not carry their national flag, otherwise they would take certain measures. However, the International Committee of the Festival believes that the festival is open and equal to all countries. It respects the independence and freedom of all countries. The Algerian delegation has the same rights as other delegations. Therefore, the International Committee requested that all delegations roll up their national flags. This appeal was endorsed by all delegations.

    抗议奥政府不准阿尔及利亚代表团拿国旗
    所有代表团都卷着国旗参加开幕式
    据新华社维也纳27日电  第七届世界青年联欢节国际委员会27日举行了联欢节记者招待会。国际委员会主席、世界民主青年联合会主席柏尼尼在会上发表了讲话。他说，26日举行的联欢节开幕式取得了惊人的成就。它体现了全世界青年的强大力量和蓬勃朝气，也充分表现了奥地利人民和青年对联欢节的真诚与热情。奥地利人民同某些人的预期和做法相反，不愿对联欢节保持“沉默”。
    柏尼尼接着对在联欢节开幕式上各国代表团没有展开国旗一事，作了说明。他说，奥地利当局在开幕式前夕，要求阿尔及利亚代表团不拿国旗，否则他们将采取一定措施。但是，联欢节国际委员会认为，联欢节对一切国家都是开放和平等的。它尊重一切国家的独立与
  自由。阿尔及利亚代表团同其他代表团一样，有着同样的权利。因此，国际委员会要求各国代表团都把国旗收卷起来。这一呼吁得到了所有代表团的赞同。
