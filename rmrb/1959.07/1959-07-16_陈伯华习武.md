    Chen Bohua Practices Martial Arts
    (Our dispatch) The famous Han Opera actress Chen Bohua is stepping up rehearsals for the new play "Mu Guiying Cracks the Tianmen Formation" and striving to participate in the Hubei Provincial Art Performance in mid-July.
    Chen Bohua is a well-known Dan role in the Han Opera world, famous for performing civil plays. Her starring roles in plays such as "Yuzhou Feng" and "Er Du Mei" have been unanimously applauded by audiences in Wuhan, Beijing, and Shanghai. However, Chen Bohua, who has outstanding talent in performing civil plays, is quite unfamiliar with martial plays. In order to portray the image of Mu Guiying, who is highly skilled in martial arts, Chen Bohua is now determined to learn martial arts. It is indeed a difficult task for her to start learning martial arts from scratch in the hot summer and to demand effective results in a short period of time. However, she is not intimidated by this. She is still full of confidence and studies diligently from morning to night every day, and humbly asks experienced actors for advice.
    Now, Chen Bohua has made significant progress in martial arts. In the two rehearsals, although she wore a "Seven Star Dipper" helmet weighing more than three pounds and had her chest tightly bound with a "Da Ying Kao," she was not only agile and active during the dance, with a loud voice, and did not feel cumbersome, but also cleverly combined martial arts with the dance movements of the Wen Dan, making the movements and posture particularly exquisite and beautiful.

### 陈伯华习武

    陈伯华习武
    本报讯　著名汉剧演员陈伯华，正在加紧排练新戏“穆桂英智破天门阵”，争取在7月中参加湖北省文艺会演。
    陈伯华是汉剧界著名的演文戏的旦角，她主演的“宇宙锋”、“二度梅”等剧，无论是在武汉或北京、上海，都受到观众的一致喝彩。但是，演文戏有卓越才能的陈伯华，对于武戏却是颇为陌生的。陈伯华为了刻划武艺超群的穆桂英的形象，现在决心习武。在炎热的夏天从头开始学习武功，并要求在很短时间内收到成效，对她来说确是一件比较困难的事情。但她毫不因此而畏惧，仍然满怀信心地天天起早摸黑地勤学苦练，并虚心向内行演员请教。
    现在，陈伯华在武功方面已有显著进步。在两次彩排中，她虽头戴三斤多重的“七星斗”盔，胸部紧扎“大硬靠”，不仅舞蹈时敏捷活跃，嗓音宏亮，毫不感到累赘，而且还把武工与文旦的舞蹈动作巧妙地结合一起，动作、身段格外精采优美。（附图片）
