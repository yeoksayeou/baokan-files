The pest and disease elimination work in the first half of this year has also achieved significant results with the great development of industrial and agricultural production.

At the beginning of the year, cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Bengbu, combined with the manure accumulation campaign, first proposed the slogan of "Vigorously Accumulating Manure to Support the Countryside and Improve Environmental Hygiene." Subsequently, medium and small towns and rural areas throughout the country universally launched repeated and large-scale sanitation campaigns around the Spring Festival, Qingming Festival, and "May Day," closely combining manure accumulation, eliminating the four pests, and promoting hygiene; this not only greatly improved environmental hygiene but also vigorously promoted the agricultural manure accumulation and production increase campaign. According to statistics from thirteen provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, a total of 7 billion tons of fertilizer were accumulated from January to May. Since the beginning of spring, many regions have simultaneously grasped the grass cutting and protection work for preventing schistosomiasis and snail eradication, or have grasped the work of anti-relapse treatment for malaria. Through the above work, the health of millions of laborers in grass cutting and manure accumulation was effectively guaranteed from new schistosomiasis infections; by the end of May, the snail eradication area reached more than 360 million square meters, and more than 5 million people received anti-relapse treatment for malaria. During the spring plowing and rice planting and summer harvesting and planting seasons, provinces such as Hunan, Sichuan, and Jiangxi successively put forward the slogan of "Everything is for Supporting Spring Plowing Production," and transferred a large number of health personnel from cities to rural areas. The Hengyang Special District in Hunan Province extracted more than 9,500 health personnel, formed more than 1,200 mobile medical teams, and basically ensured that each production work group had one or two health cadres. These dispatched health personnel lived, ate, and labored with the masses in rural areas, treating diseases when there were diseases and preventing diseases when there were no diseases, helping communes and production teams train a large number of health workers and cooks, and strengthening the hygiene management of canteens. Therefore, it basically achieved "minor illnesses treated in the fields, major illnesses not leaving the village," which not only guaranteed the health of the labor force and improved labor attendance but also boosted the labor enthusiasm of the masses. While carrying out the above work, various localities also carried out disease investigation and treatment for schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, filariasis, and other major parasitic diseases. According to statistics from thirteen southern provinces and cities, more than 230,000 people have been treated for schistosomiasis, more than 9 million for hookworm disease, and more than 1.57 million for filariasis.

This year, various production tasks in rural areas are relatively tight, and the prevention and control of diseases has been able to achieve such significant results, which should be said to be a major victory on the health front. However, we must not be satisfied with these achievements and become paralyzed and slack. We must realize that to consolidate these achievements we have already made is a very arduous task, and to achieve the great goal of completely eliminating diseases is still very far, very far away. Since the beginning of summer, the weather has become increasingly hot, and various pests such as mosquitoes and flies have bred in large numbers, so the incidence of intestinal infectious diseases in many places has also increased accordingly. For this reason, we must arouse high vigilance, seize this important period in the current pest and disease elimination, immediately deploy and grasp the summer and autumn prevention and control work according to the different conditions of cities and rural areas, and continue to deeply give various diseases a serious blow.

The current pest and disease elimination work in cities should immediately launch a campaign centered on eliminating mosquitoes and flies, preventing summer and autumn infectious diseases, vigorously accumulating manure to support the countryside, and improving environmental hygiene. Cities have concentrated populations and convenient transportation, and mosquitoes and flies are easy to breed. If diseases occur, they spread quickly. Therefore, pest and disease elimination work in cities must be grasped tightly from beginning to end throughout the year. Large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have recently proposed organizing three or four large-scale campaigns from July to the end of September; and after each campaign, do more in-depth and meticulous routine cleaning and hygiene work to give a devastating blow to various residual pests. Not only that, but they are also preparing to launch several larger-scale pest and disease elimination campaigns in winter to prevent diseases from having a chance to breathe and recover. Various localities should also organize several campaigns from now until National Day according to their own conditions. After National Day, they should continue to implement different key points according to the progress of the work and the characteristics of the diseases.

In rural areas, it is necessary to closely integrate with the production movement, seize the gap in busy farming, vigorously eliminate mosquito and fly breeding grounds, manage human and animal manure well; conscientiously do a good job in the hygiene work of collective living units such as public canteens, and guard this important pass to prevent the spread of diseases; actively carry out disease investigation and treatment for various parasitic diseases. Pest and disease elimination work in rural areas should be carried out with emphasis according to the disease situation. In schistosomiasis-endemic areas, a high tide of pest and disease elimination focusing on the prevention and control of schistosomiasis should be launched immediately. All areas that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis should strive towards the direction of eradication; all places where it is possible to eliminate schistosomiasis should strive to reach the standard of basic elimination before the end of the year. Areas where schistosomiasis is not prevalent should focus on the most serious and harmful disease prevalent locally, in order to drive the development of the entire pest and disease elimination movement. All areas where various water, drought, and other disasters have occurred, pest and disease elimination work should be quickly followed up to ensure the health of disaster victims and prevent the spread of the epidemic.

Pest and disease elimination work, whether in cities or rural areas, must implement the principle of repeated struggle. Eliminating diseases is a very arduous task, and it is definitely not possible to eliminate them cleanly through one or two campaigns a year. It must go through several years of planned, one-after-another organized campaigns combined with routine work in repeated struggles, giving pests no chance to survive and breed. In order to make each campaign achieve greater results, it is necessary to appropriately select the time for the campaign according to the characteristics of the growth and development of different pests, in accordance with the principle of "hitting early and hitting small." After each campaign, it is necessary to immediately grasp the routine pest and disease elimination work. It must be pointed out that having only campaigns without in-depth and meticulous routine work not only fails to consolidate the results of the campaigns, but also pests will breed and multiply again with a slight neglect. For this reason, it is necessary to educate cadres and the masses to establish necessary hygiene systems, improve grassroots health organizations, and train a group of basic pest and disease elimination teams, such as street cleaners, manure managers, disinfectors, and health workers; carry out routine pest and disease elimination work according to the methods of fixed personnel, fixed points, and fixed tasks to consolidate the results of the campaigns. At the same time, it is also necessary to seriously summarize experience after each campaign, and improve the level of the masses in fighting diseases from the perspective of ideological understanding and health knowledge. It is also necessary to rely on the basic pest and disease elimination team to conduct in-depth investigations, find out the local disease situation, study and propose countermeasures, so that each campaign has new requirements and new tasks, in order to encourage the masses to be always full of energy and high fighting spirit in each movement. All areas that carry out repeated struggles in this way will inevitably be both vigorous and down-to-earth, the work will become more and more meticulous, and the results will become more and more significant.

Pest and disease elimination work must implement the policy of serving production and work. To implement this policy, it is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between pest and disease elimination and production. The purpose of preventing and controlling diseases is to protect the health of the people and promote the continuous development of production. Therefore, the purpose of pest and disease elimination and production is the same. Production and pest and disease elimination are both aspects of people's struggle against nature. From this point of view, the nature of the struggle between the two is also the same. That is to say, the relationship between production and pest and disease elimination originally has its commonality in objectivity, which is the basic and dominant aspect. Precisely because of this, the possibility of the two being closely combined is objectively present. For example, snail eradication, eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds, and managing manure can be combined with manure accumulation. Both fertilizer is accumulated and pests are eliminated and diseases are prevented; water conservancy construction can be combined with snail eradication and protecting drinking water sources, etc., which can achieve the best of both worlds in production and pest and disease elimination. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the unified leadership of the party committees at all levels, organize close cooperation, and make this objective possibility a reality. In this way, production and pest and disease elimination can be closely combined, mutually promoted, and jointly improved. However, production and pest and disease elimination, as a specific struggle, have their differences. This point is very clear and cannot be ignored. Since there are differences, there are contradictions. This contradiction is specifically manifested in the needs and allocation of labor, in specific organizational work and time arrangements, and so on. Since the fundamental purpose of production and pest and disease elimination is the same, and it is what people must do, the contradiction is temporary and can be unified. The key to the problem is to grasp this contradiction, conduct specific analysis, and specifically solve this contradiction through appropriate arrangements. On the basis of ensuring production, deploy the manpower and material resources that can be extracted to complete certain pest and disease elimination tasks. Completing the task of pest and disease elimination protects the health and labor force of the people, which makes it possible to further promote production. In short, to carry out pest and disease elimination work, the fundamental guarantee lies in the party committees at all levels strengthening leadership and making unified arrangements.

Pest and disease elimination is an arduous and complex task, and there are many difficulties in completing this task. However, we must not be intimidated by difficulties; on the contrary, the more difficult it is, the more we must be energetic and resolutely launch a persistent and unremitting struggle against diseases. We are revolutionaries, and since we can overthrow the fate of the reactionaries who oppress the people, we will surely be able to overthrow the fate of all kinds of diseases that harm the people. Victory will surely belong to us. On the basis of past great achievements, we must advance victoriously, continue to exert our efforts, strive for the top, and resolutely send these "plague gods" that harm the people to the west.

    夏秋季除害灭病工作必须抓紧抓好
    今年上半年的除害灭病工作，随着工农业生产的大发展，也取得了重大的成绩。
    年初，北京、上海、蚌埠等城市结合积肥运动，首先提出了“大搞积肥，支援农村，改善环境卫生”的口号。接着，各地中、小城镇和农村，普遍地围绕着春节、清明、“五一”等节日，反复多次地掀起了声势浩大的卫生突击运动，把积肥料、除四害和讲卫生密切结合起来；既大大改善了环境卫生，又有力地促进了农业积肥增产运动。据江苏等十三个省、市统计，1至5月共积肥七十亿吨。入春以来，好些地区同时抓紧了预防血吸虫病的打草防护工作和灭螺工作，或者抓紧开展了疟疾抗复发治疗的工作。通过上述工作，有力地保证了百万劳动大军在打草积肥中免受血吸虫病的新感染；到5月底止，灭螺面积达三亿六千多平方米，接受疟疾抗复发治疗的有五百多万人。在春耕栽秧和夏收夏种时期，湖南、四川、江西等省相继提出了“一切为了支援春耕生产”的口号，从城市抽调了大批卫生人员下放到农村。湖南衡阳专区抽出卫生人员九千五百多名，组成一千二百多个巡回医疗队，基本上做到每个生产作业组有一两名卫生干部。这些下放的卫生人员在农村中与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，有病治病，无病防病，帮助公社、生产队训练了大批保健员、炊事员，加强了食堂的卫生管理。因此，基本上做到了“小病田头治，大病不出村”，不仅保证了劳动大军的健康，提高了劳动出勤率，而且鼓舞了群众的劳动热情。在进行以上工作的同时，各地还开展了对血吸虫病、钩虫病、丝虫病和其他各种重大的寄生虫病的查病治病工作。据南方十三省、市统计，已治血吸虫病二十三万多人，钩虫病九百万多人，丝虫病一百五十七万多人。
    今年农村各地生产等任务比较紧张，而防治病害工作能够取得这样重大的成绩，应该说这是卫生战线的一个重大胜利。可是，我们决不能满足于这些成绩而麻痹松劲。必须认识到，我们要巩固已经取得的这些成绩，就是十分艰巨的任务，而要达到完全消除病害的伟大目标，更相差得很远很远。入夏以来，天气日渐炎热，蚊蝇等各种害虫大量孳生，因而不少地方的肠道传染病的发病率也相继增多。为此，我们必须引起高度的警惕，应该抓住当前除害灭病中的这一段重要时期，根据城市与农村不同的情况，立即部署与抓好夏秋的防治工作，继续深入地给各种病害以严重打击。
    当前城市的除害灭病工作，应该立即开展一个以消灭蚊蝇、预防夏秋季传染病、大搞积肥支援农村、改善环境卫生为中心的突击运动。城市人口集中，交通方便，蚊蝇容易孳生，如有病害发生，传播也快。所以，对于城市的除害灭病工作，必须一年到头自始至终地抓紧。北京、上海等大城市最近提出要从7月份起到9月底，组织三、四次大规模的突击运动；并且要在每次突击后，更深入更细致地做好经常的清洁卫生工作，给各种残存虫害以歼灭性的打击。不仅如此，他们还准备在冬季再掀起几次更大规模的除害灭病运动，使病害没有喘息回生的机会。各地也应该根据自己的情况，从现在到国庆节前，组织几次突击。国庆节以后，还要根据工作进展的情况和病害的特点，抓住不同的重点继续贯彻。
    在农村中，应该紧密结合生产运动，抓紧农忙间歇，大力消灭蚊蝇孳生地，管理好人畜粪便；认真做好公共食堂等集体生活单位的卫生工作，把守好这一道防止疾病传播的重要关口；积极开展各种寄生虫病的查病治病工作。农村的除害灭病工作应该根据病害情况，有重点地进行。在血吸虫病流行区，应该立即掀起一个以防治血吸虫病为重点的除害灭病高潮。凡是已经基本消灭血吸虫病的地区，要向根除的方向努力；凡是有可能消灭的地方都要力争年前达到基本消灭的标准。没有血吸虫病流行的地区，应该抓住当地流行最严重、危害最大的一种疾病为重点，借以带动整个除害灭病运动的开展。凡是发生各种水、旱等灾情的地区，除害灭病工作更应该迅速跟上去，以保证灾民健康，防止疫情扩大。
    除害灭病工作，不论在城市或农村，都必须贯彻反复斗争的原则。消灭病害是一项十分艰巨的任务，决不是通过一年一两次突击运动就能够消灭干净的。必须经过若干年有计划地一个接一个地组织突击运动和经常工作相结合的反复斗争，不给害虫有苟延喘息而孳生繁殖的机会。为了使每次突击运动取得更大的效果，必须根据不同害虫生长发育的特点，按照“打早打小”的原则，适当地选择突击运动的时间。在每次突击后要立即抓好经常性的除害灭病工作。必须指出：单有突击运动而没有深入细致的经常工作，不仅突击运动的成果不能巩固，而且稍有疏忽，害虫又会孳生繁殖起来。为此，必须教育干部和群众建立必要的卫生制度，健全基层卫生组织，培养和训练一批除害灭病的基本队伍，如地段清洁员、管粪员、消毒员、保健员等；按照定人、定点、定任务的办法，开展经常性的除害灭病工作，巩固突击运动的成果。同时，还要在每次突击运动以后，认真总结经验，从思想认识上和卫生知识上提高群众与病害作斗争的水平。还要依靠除害灭病的基本队伍，进行深入的调查，弄清当地病害的情况，研究提出对策，使每次突击都有新的要求，新的任务，以便鼓舞群众在每次运动中能够始终精神饱满，斗志昂扬。凡是这样开展反复斗争的地区，必然会做到既是轰轰烈烈，又能踏踏实实，工作越做越细致，成绩也就越来越显著。
    除害灭病工作，必须贯彻为生产、为工作服务的方针。要贯彻这个方针，就要正确处理除害灭病和生产这二者之间的关系。防治病害的目的是为了保护人民的健康、促进生产的不断发展。所以，除害灭病和生产的目的是一致的。而生产与除害灭病又都是人们向自然界进行斗争的一个方面。从这个意义上来讲，二者的斗争性质也是相同的。这就是说，生产与除害灭病二者的关系，在客观上本来就有它的共同性，这是基本的、主导的一面。正因为如此，二者紧密结合起来进行的可能性是客观存在的。例如，灭螺、消灭蚊蝇孳生地、管理粪便可以与积肥结合起来。既积了肥又除了害防了病；兴修水利可以与灭螺、保护饮用水源等结合起来，可以做到生产与除害灭病一举两得等等。所以，必须依靠各级党委的统一领导，组织密切的协作，使这一客观的可能性成为现实。这样，就能够把生产与除害灭病紧密结合起来，互相促进，共同提高。但是，生产与除害灭病作为一个具体斗争来讲，二者之间又有它的差别性。这一点是十分明白的，也是不可忽视的。既有差别性，就有矛盾。这种矛盾具体表现在劳动力的需要和调配方面，表现在具体的组织工作和时间安排方面，等等。由于生产与除害灭病的根本目的是一致的，而且又是人们所必须的，所以矛盾是暂时的，是可以统一起来的。问题的关键是，要把握住这个矛盾，进行具体的分析，通过适当的安排，具体地解决这个矛盾。要在保证生产的基础上，调配可以抽出的人力物力，去完成一定的除害灭病任务。完成了除害灭病的任务，就保护了人民的健康和劳动力，就有可能进一步推动生产。总之，要开展除害灭病工作，根本的保证是在于各级党委加强领导，进行统一安排。
    除害灭病是一个艰巨复杂的任务，要完成这个任务是有不少困难的。但是，我们决不能为困难所吓倒；相反，越是困难，越是要精神奋发，更加坚决地向病害展开持久不懈的斗争。我们是革命者，我们既然能够革掉压迫人民的反动派的命，我们也必然能够革掉危害人民的各种病害的命。胜利必然是属于我们的。我们要在过去的巨大成就的基础上，乘胜前进，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，坚决地把这些危害人民的“瘟神”送上西天。
