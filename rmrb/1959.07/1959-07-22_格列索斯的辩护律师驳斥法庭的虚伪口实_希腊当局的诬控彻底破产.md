Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 20th (TASS): In the Athens Military Court's trial on the 20th, Glezos's defense continued its arguments.

    Glezos's defense lawyer, Vassilatos, demanded that Glezos not be subjected to judicial framing after already being completely exonerated. He said that the prosecutor's demand to imprison Glezos was politically motivated, with the aim of causing Glezos to be "politically dead." The lawyer said that apart from those political considerations that have no place in the court, the charges against Glezos are baseless.

    The lawyer pointed out that members of the military court were attempting to cast doubt on the authenticity of Glezos's confession. He said that Glezos is a person of high moral character, and there is no doubt that he speaks the truth. Vassilatos refuted the claim that the world public's movement to defend Glezos was an attempt to exert pressure on the court. He pointed out that this movement is justified because there is no question of the defendant being involved in any espionage activities. Another defense lawyer, Stephanakis, emphasized that during the trial, a series of clauses in the Greek Constitution and the Criminal Code were violated. He said that, in particular, the court allowed the police who had investigated the defendant's case to act as witnesses for the prosecution; but according to the law, their testimony is invalid. He emphasized that the accusations against Glezos and other defendants for engaging in espionage activities were based on these testimonies, and only on these testimonies. This practice undermines the basic principles of legal proceedings.

    The defense emphasized that he opposed the accusations against Glezos which were based on assumptions and inferences. He pointed out that the military court itself had been forced to repeatedly change the nature of the accusations against Glezos; this fact alone is enough to prove the bankruptcy of the accusations against Glezos.

    Stephanakis was also the defense lawyer for another defendant, Trikalinos. He emphasized that there were attempts to convict the defendant based on political views. There is nothing to indicate that Trikalinos had engaged in espionage activities.

    Trikalinos' other defense lawyer, Damaskinos, demanded that the defendant be declared innocent. He protested against the persecution of Trikalinos for political reasons. He pointed out that Trikalinos had fought bravely against the German aggressors. He had fought against the establishment of missile bases in Greece.

    格列索斯的辩护律师驳斥法庭的虚伪口实
    希腊当局的诬控彻底破产
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社雅典20日讯：在雅典军事法庭20日的审讯中，格列索斯的辩护人继续发言。
    格列索斯的辩护律师瓦西拉托斯要求不许对已经被完全确定无罪的格列索斯进行司法陷害。他说，检察官要求监禁格列索斯是出于政治动机，目的是使格列索斯在“政治上死亡”。律师说，除了在法庭上不容有的那些政治考虑外，对格列索斯的控告是毫无根据的。
    律师指出，军事法庭成员企图使人怀疑格列索斯供词的真实性。他说，格列索斯是一个道德高尚的人，他说的都是真实话，这点不容怀疑。瓦西拉托斯驳斥了认为世界公众保卫格列索斯的运动是企图对法庭施加压力的说法。他指出，这个运动是正当的，因为被告谈不上有什么间谍活动。另一位辩护律师斯特凡纳基斯着重指出，在审讯过程中，希腊宪法和刑法法典中的一系列条款都遭到了破坏。他说，尤其是，法庭允许对被告案件进行过侦查的警察作原告证人；但根据法律，他们的证词是无效的。他强调说，控告格列索斯和其他被告进行间谍活动就是根据这些证词，而且是仅仅根据这些证词提出的。这种做法破坏了诉讼手续的基本准则。
    辩护人着重指出，他反对以假设和推论为根据而对格列索斯提出的控告。他指出，军事法庭本身就已经被迫一再改变对格列索斯控告的性质；这一事实就足以证明对格列索斯的控告的破产。
    斯特凡纳基斯也是另一位被告特里卡利诺斯的辩护人。他着重指出，有人企图根据政治观点来给被告定罪。没有任何东西能说明特里卡利诺斯进行过间谍活动。
    特里卡利诺斯的另外一位辩护人达马斯基诺斯要求宣布被告无罪。他抗议因政治原因而对特里卡利诺斯进行迫害。他指出，特里卡利诺斯曾经同德国侵略者英勇作战。他曾进行斗争反对在希腊建立火箭基地。
