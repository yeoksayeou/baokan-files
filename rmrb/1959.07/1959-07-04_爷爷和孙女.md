Grandpa and Granddaughter
Xu Qi

In the evening glow, Grandpa and Granddaughter stroll along the Kundulun River...

Grandpa is wearing a purplish-red Mongolian robe; his brand-new riding boots still carry the fragrance of the vast grassland. He strokes his brownish-yellow beard, his eyes curved like crescent moons, full of smiles, never leaving the girl's face.

Ah, this is my little Urna! This is Urna who has been riding a枣 red horse since she was seven, galloping on the grassland, this is Urna who, on starry nights, would tug at the corner of my robe, asking me to tell the story of Gada Meilin. Look, now she has grown up. A hat covers her long two braids, and her blue overalls are stained with spots of oil. She has become a skilled worker!

Early in the morning, Grandpa bid farewell to his old wife. He brought the purest white cream, the most delicious yellow sheep meat, and the most precious furs, to visit his little granddaughter. All the way he was thinking: How has Urna changed? Has she grown more beautiful? Has she grown taller? What important work is she doing? Although these were all written clearly in her letter, Grandpa always wanted to see it with his own eyes.

When the car carrying Grandpa arrived in Kundulun District of Baotou, he saw two rows of red brick buildings neatly standing beside the road. People told Grandpa that this was the workers' dormitory. The windows of the houses seemed to be opened in the clouds. Ah! My little granddaughter lives in the sky.

When the car carrying Grandpa arrived in the Baogang (Baotou Steel) factory area, Grandpa saw chimneys taller than each other. Others told him that next to the hot blast stove, the scrubbing tower, and the steel frame supporting the blue sky, was the No. 1 blast furnace body that would soon flow out a lot of molten iron. Suddenly, hiss hiss hiss... a flash of light in front of him, a silver flower bloomed like lightning, and then, it appeared everywhere. The top of the towering mountain has snow lotus, is this the snow lotus on the ground? Ah, no, that's the skill of the welder!

The Party branch secretary led Grandpa to the place where Urna works. The Baogang Machinery General Factory workshop occupies a very, very large piece of sandy land. Grandpa seemed to have entered a maze. If the branch secretary hadn't led him, he really wouldn't know where to enter from or where to exit from. Sunlight poured into the workshop from the skylight. In the bright factory building, the machines were spinning. How big the machine is! The rumbling sound travels ten thousand miles; the overhead crane is running on the high roof. It moves, moves, and shifts with the whistle. Then hang down the long iron hook and pull up the large machine parts. The Party branch secretary said, "Old man, look! Who is that?" Who is it? Who is that? The person driving the overhead crane? That petite figure in blue overalls. Could it be that my eyes are dazzled, that face is actually like Urna's. "Yes." The Party branch secretary seemed to have guessed Grandpa's surprise, "She is Urna, your little granddaughter!"

Ah! Urna, a happy girl of the Mao Zedong era. The Party has cultivated you into such a useful person! If it were in the old society, you would bury your youth in the desolate grassland, as a slave of princes and herdbosses. Now the tall overhead crane is like your grown limbs, the hanging heavy iron hook is like your arm, at your command, swinging as you wish; no matter how heavy the steel pipe components, you can gently and steadily lift them high. Who gave you such great strength, infinite wisdom, to contribute to the great cause of building Baogang and building socialism? It is the Party! Grandpa couldn't help but shed tears of gratitude.

In the evening glow, Grandpa and Granddaughter stroll along the Kundulun River...

The old man strokes his brownish-yellow beard, the girl shakes off her shiny long braids, on the sandy ground, the setting sun lengthens their shadows.

One said, Grandma misses you very much. Your dad is the production team leader in the commune. The lambing went smoothly this spring. The sheep are strong, and the horses are fat. A bumper harvest is just around the corner. The head of the cooperative wants to invite your grandfather to the home for the elderly. I said, I'm still hale and hearty, I won't go! …Ah, your favorite little calf has become the mother of three children. Thus, the people and things of hometown are shown in the girl's eyes, more cordial and more beautiful. One said, I love my hometown, but I love Baogang even more, I am willing to work here for a lifetime. The Party cares for me so deeply, and the comrades are more kind to me than my sisters. When I make a tiny achievement, the Party gives me great honor. I attended the city's meeting of young activists. Ah, a poet even described me in the newspaper...

They interrupted each other, and then interrupted each other's words again, and were often interrupted by the laughter that came out together. The wind blew their laughter away, on the banks of the Kundulun River, and merged with the low singing of the flowing water...

    爷爷和孙女
    许淇
    晚霞里，爷爷和孙女，漫步在昆都仑河边……
    爷爷穿着紫红的蒙古袍；崭亮的马靴还沾着大草原的香气。他捋着棕黄的胡须，一双弯成月牙的眼睛，满含笑意，始终没离开少女的脸
    啊啊，这就是我的小乌日娜！这就是从七岁起就骑着枣红马，在草地驰骋的乌日娜，这就是在繁星点点的夜晚，拉住我的袍角，要我讲嘎达梅林故事的小乌日娜。看，现在她已长成了。一顶帽子罩住了她长长的两条发辫，蓝布工作服上染着斑斑油渍，她已经成了一个有技术的工人了！
    清早起，爷爷告别了老妻。带上最洁白的奶油，最鲜美的黄羊肉，最珍贵的皮子，来探望他的小孙女。一路上他都在想：乌日娜变得怎样了？长得更美了？长得高大了？她在干什么重要的活呢？这些虽然在她的信里，都写得明明白白的，但爷爷总想亲眼看一看。
    当汽车载着爷爷来到包头昆独仑区，就看见两排红砖大楼整整齐齐，立在大路旁边。人家告诉爷爷，这就是工人宿舍。房屋的窗户好像开在云端里。啊！我的小孙女，住在天上哩。
    当汽车载着爷爷来到包钢厂区。爷爷看见一座比一座更高的烟囱。别人告诉他那挨着什么热风炉呀，洗涤塔呀，钢架子正顶住蓝天的，就是快要流出很多铁水的一号高炉炉体。忽然间，哧哧哧……眼前一亮，闪电般地开出一朵银花，紧接着，遍地都现了。摩天的山顶有雪莲，这难道就是地上的雪莲？啊，不是，那是电焊工的手艺！
    党支部书记领爷爷到乌日娜工作的地点。包钢机械总厂厂房占了很大很大一片砂地。爷爷好像走进了迷宫，要不是支书领着他，他真不知从哪儿进来，哪儿出去。阳光从天窗上洒进车间。敞亮的厂房机器在飞旋。多大的机器！轰隆隆的响声传万里；在高高的屋顶上，天车在运行。它移动着、移动着，随着哨声推移。然后挂下长长的铁钩，把大机件拉起。党支书说：“老大爷，瞧！那是谁？”是谁？是谁？那驾驶天车的人？那穿着蓝色工作服的娇小的身躯。难道是我眼花了，那脸蛋竟像乌日娜。“是的。”党支书好像猜到了爷爷的惊疑，“她就是乌日娜，你的小孙女！”
    啊！乌日娜，毛泽东时代幸福的女孩子。党把你培养成一个多么有用的人！如果在旧社会，你会在凄苦的草原埋葬青春，当王爷和牧主的奴隶。现在高大的天车像是你长出的肢体，吊重的铁钩，像是你的手臂，听你使唤，摆动如意；再重的钢管构件，你也能轻轻地把它们稳放高举。是谁给了你这样巨大的力量，无穷的智慧，为建设包钢、建设社会主义的伟大事业作出贡献？是党！爷爷不禁流下感激的泪。
    晚霞里，爷爷和孙女，漫步在昆都仑河边……
    老人捋着棕黄的胡须，少女甩开油亮的长辫，在砂地里，落日拖长了他们的身影。
    一个说，奶奶很想你。你爹在公社当了生产队长。今年春天接羔挺顺利。羊儿壮、马儿膘肥。丰收就在眼前。社长要请你爷爷上敬老院。我说，我还硬朗，才不去呢！……啊啊，你最喜爱的小牛犊子，已当了三个孩子的妈哩。于是，故乡的人和事，在少女的眼前展现出来，更加亲切也更加美丽。一个说，我爱故乡，但我更爱包钢，我愿一辈子在这里劳动。党这样深切地关怀我，同志们对我比姊妹还亲。当我做出微小的一点成绩，党就给我大荣誉。我出席了全市的青年积极分子会议。啊啊，一位诗人还在报纸上把我描写了一番……
    他俩你打断我的话，我又把你的话打断，又时时被一同发出的笑声打断。风把他们的笑语吹去，在昆都仑河边，和流水的低唱合在一起……（附图片）
