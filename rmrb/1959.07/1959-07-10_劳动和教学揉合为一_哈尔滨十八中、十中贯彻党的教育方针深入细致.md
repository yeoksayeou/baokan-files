(Reported by this newspaper) Harbin No. 18 and No. 10 Middle Schools thoroughly and meticulously implement the Party's education policy. They fully explore the elements of productive labor contained in the curriculum content in classroom teaching, making organic connections. In productive labor, they try to connect and apply the content taught in the classroom as much as possible, so that students can consolidate their understanding and master knowledge, thereby improving the quality of teaching.

Not long after the start of this semester, Harbin No. 18 Middle School and No. 10 Middle School, based on the principle that school productive labor should be combined with teaching as much as possible and be suitable for the age, physical strength, interests and hobbies of ordinary junior high school students, reorganized several small factories that had been set up last year. Some of these factories are linked to factories outside the school and have become small workshops set up in the school by the factories. Some process orders for factories or shops outside the school. Some use the side materials and waste materials of large factories as raw materials. Therefore, they can generally maintain regular production, providing the school with a base for combining teaching and productive labor.

In order to organically link teaching content and productive labor, at the beginning of this semester, each teaching and research group organized teachers to comprehensively study teaching materials; the school's various factories also specifically formulated plans for productive labor to connect with teaching. This has changed the situation in the past where teaching could not be connected frequently. Teachers would connect when they had an idea, but would not connect when they didn't think of it; they wouldn't connect when they should, and would force a connection when they shouldn't. Now they can connect with production practice in a planned and purposeful way during normal lesson preparation and teaching. For example, mathematics teachers at Harbin No. 18 Middle School extensively cited the principles and numerical relationships used in carpentry, metalworking, tailoring and other labor to compile many arithmetic, algebra, and geometry exercises. Physics teachers used examples such as blacksmiths forging iron and building dikes to help students quickly and thoroughly understand the transformation of kinetic energy and potential energy, and the relationship between mass, velocity, and height in energy. Geometry teachers at No. 10 Middle School used the relationship between belt pulleys and belts on lathes to explain the theorem of internal and external common tangents of circles. Physics classes connect with the example of construction site workers near the school creating a "sloping bridge winch brick conveyor" to save labor, explaining the principles of inclined planes, pulleys, and other mechanics. Using production examples for teaching in this way not only enriches the teaching content, but also inspires students to understand the principles of new knowledge from practice, reduces the burden of rote memorization, and strengthens ideological activity.

On the other hand, teachers pay attention to combining the theoretical knowledge of various classroom teachings in diversified productive labor so that theory can be verified in practice, such as combining chemical knowledge in barium chloride and refined salt factory labor; conducting various biological experiments in greenhouses and farms; and connecting the lever principle of physics when students use axes to pull nails or other tools. In the production labor of small transformer factories, students learn how the "electromagnetic induction" principle taught in physics class is used in the manufacture of transformers. In this way, students' ability to apply theoretical knowledge is exercised in production practice, making the knowledge they master more solid, thereby improving the quality of teaching. For example, students at No. 18 Middle School discovered in their labor in the wood factory that the finished window frames could not be installed with windows, and they knew to use the theorem of "equal diagonals of rectangles" in geometry to check that the window frames did not meet the rectangular specifications. When making patterns for desks, equilateral triangles need to be made, but the wood factory does not have a protractor, so the students used the method of "making a square and sawing the diagonal" to solve the problem of insufficient tools. Some students also used their knowledge of physics and electricity to install all the circuits in the school's metal and wood factories and the lighting in the coking plant. For example, in this year's graduation exams for junior high school students in these two schools, teachers were satisfied to report that in the past, exam questions only required written answers to some basic concepts and calculations; this year, in addition to written exams, oral exams and practical operations were combined to comprehensively examine students' understanding, mastery and application of knowledge. The requirements of the examination have been raised, and the number of students obtaining excellent grades has also increased. (Attached picture)

### 劳动和教学揉合为一   哈尔滨十八中、十中贯彻党的教育方针深入细致

    劳动和教学揉合为一
    哈尔滨十八中、十中贯彻党的教育方针深入细致
    本报讯　哈尔滨市第十八、第十中学深入细致地贯彻党的教育方针，在课堂教学中充分挖掘课程内容所包含的生产劳动因素，作有机的联系；在生产劳动中又尽可能联系运用课堂讲授内容，使学生更巩固地理解和掌握知识，因而提高了教学质量。
    这学期开学不久，哈尔滨十八中学和第十中学即根据学校的生产劳动应尽量结合教学，适合普通初中学生年龄、体力、兴趣爱好等特点，整顿了去年办起来的几个小工厂。这些工厂，有的与校外工厂挂钩成为工厂设在学校的小车间，有的为校外工厂或商店加工订货，有的利用大工厂的边材废料作原料；因而一般能保持经常生产，给学校提供了教学与生产劳动相结合的基地。
    为了使教学内容和生产劳动有机地联系起来，这学期开学时，各教研组就组织教师全面研究教材；学校的各个工厂也具体制订了生产劳动联系教学的计划。这就改变了过去教学中不能经常联系的情况，教师灵机一动就联系，想不起来就不联系，该联系的不联系，不该联系的硬联系，而能在平时备课和教课中有计划、有目的地联系生产实际。像哈尔滨十八中学数学教师广泛引用木工、金工、裁缝等劳动中应用的原理和数字关系，编写了很多算术、代数、几何习题；物理教师用锻工打铁、筑堤打夯等实例，使学生很快就透彻地理解了动能和势能的转换及能量中质量、速度和高度的关系。第十中学几何教师用车床上皮带轮和皮带的关系，讲解圆的内、外公切线定理；物理课联系学校附近基建工地工人创造“斜桥式绞车送砖机”节省劳力的实例，讲解力学中斜面、滑轮等原理。这样引用生产实例进行教学，不但丰富了教学内容，而且启发学生从实践中去理解新知识的原理，减少死记硬背的负担，加强了思想活动能力。
    另方面，教师在多样化的生产劳动中注意结合各科课堂教学的理论知识，使理论在实际中得到验证，如在氯化钡、精盐工厂劳动中结合化学知识；在温室和农场进行各种生物实验；在学生使用斧子拔钉子或其他工具时，联系物理的杠杆原理；在小变压器厂生产劳动中，使学生了解物理课讲过的“电磁感应”原理，怎样运用在变压器的制造中。这样就在生产实践中锻炼了学生运用理论知识的能力，使掌握的知识更加巩固，因而提高了教学质量。如十八中学学生在木工厂劳动中，发现做好的窗框安不上窗户，就知道运用几何学中“矩形对角线相等”的定理，检查出窗框不合矩形规格；做写字台的花纹图案中需作等腰三角形，而木工厂没有测角器，学生就用“作正方形，锯对角线”的办法解决工具不足问题。有些学生还运用物理的电学知识安装了学校金、木工厂的全部电路和炼焦厂的照明灯。又如在今年这两个学校初中三年级学生的毕业考试中，教师都满意地反映：过去考试题只要求笔答一些基本概念及进行一些计算；今年除笔试外，还结合口试和实际操作，全面考查学生对知识的理解、掌握和运用能力。考试的要求高了，而学生获得优良成绩的也增多了。（附图片）
