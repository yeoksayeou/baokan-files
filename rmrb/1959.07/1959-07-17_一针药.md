    A Shot of Medicine
    The sky was just beginning to lighten. The clear moon still hung in the western sky, and the earth was silent. A woman in her thirties, holding a girl of about three years old, with tears streaming down her face, rushed to the dormitory of a medical orderly stationed on the Zhejiang front line. The medical orderly, Comrade You Yulong, was fast asleep when he was awakened by the sudden, hurried footsteps. He quickly sat up, and before he could ask what was wrong, the woman, crying, pointed to the child in her arms and said: "Doctor Da, is there any hope?" Hearing this, the medical orderly didn't even put on his shoes before taking the child from the woman's arms and placing her on his bed.

    The child's eyes were tightly closed, her teeth clenched, and her lower body was already stiff. You Yulong quickly grabbed his stethoscope and listened all over the child's body. Fortunately, the child was still breathing faintly. He immediately comforted the child's mother, saying: "Don't cry, sister-in-law, don't worry. As long as the child has a breath left, I will do everything I can to save her." The diagnosis revealed that it was infantile convulsion, and the condition was extremely critical. So, he hurried to give the child an injection, but after more than a dozen injections, there was no effect at all. At this critical moment, he suddenly remembered that adrenaline could be used to treat this disease in an emergency, couldn't it? But then he thought, this is the comrades' emergency medicine, and there is only one dose left. The last time Comrade Qi Yingtang had a high fever of forty degrees, they were reluctant to use it; besides, without the leader's consent, this medicine could not be used. But how could he watch the child die without trying to save her? At this moment, he went straight to the instructor's room to ask for instructions. Before he could finish speaking, the instructor interrupted him:
  "Saving people is the priority, don't worry about yourself!" Soon after the adrenaline injection, the child began to cry. With the sound of crying, smiles appeared on the faces of the child's mother and You Yulong. The child was saved.

    一针药
    天刚蒙蒙亮。清澄的月亮还挂在西边的天空，大地一片沉默。一个三十来岁的妇女，手里抱着一个三岁左右的小女孩，眼泪双挂，直奔驻浙江前线某地一个卫生员的寝室。卫生员游玉龙同志正在睡梦中，被突如其来的急促脚步声惊醒了。他连忙坐了起来，没等发问，只见那个妇女一面哭，一面指着怀里的孩子说道：大军医生，有救吗？卫生员听这么一说，鞋也没穿，就从大嫂手里接过小孩，放在自己床上。
    孩子的眼睛紧闭着，牙齿咬得死死的，下身已经僵硬。游玉龙连忙拿起听筒，在孩子的身上听来听去。还好，孩子还在微弱地呼吸。他马上安慰孩子的母亲说：大嫂别哭，你放心，孩子只要有口气，我就想尽一切办法把她救活。诊断结果，原来是小儿惊风病，病势十分危急。于是，他赶忙给孩子打针，可是，一连打了十多针，没有一点效果。在这紧要关头，他突然想起肾上腺素不是能急救这病吗？但转而一想，这是同志们的急救药品，仅仅只有一支了。上一次战士齐应堂同志发高烧达四十度，也没舍得用它；再说：没经领导同意，这药是动不得的。可是，哪能看着孩子病死不救呢？这时，他直奔指导员的房间去请示。没等他说完，指导员便打断了他的话：
  “救人要紧，自己嘛，先不要去考虑！”贤上腺素注射不久，孩子便哭出了声音。随着哭声，孩子的母亲和游玉龙的脸上都露出了微笑。孩子被救活了。
