After the People's Liberation Army implemented the system of cadres serving as soldiers, the relationship between officers and soldiers became even closer. Zeng Mulin, the third platoon leader of a certain company, improved his leadership style through this experience, leading to a new atmosphere in the entire platoon where everyone felt happy, worked with great enthusiasm, and there was greater unity between superiors and subordinates.

In the past, Zeng Mulin, the third platoon leader of this unit, was loyal to the Party and worked diligently, but he was somewhat subjective in handling matters; he resolutely executed tasks without being sloppy, but his methods were somewhat rigid, and his style was not democratic enough. When soldiers made mistakes, he often couldn't patiently persuade them but would only criticize them. Once, when the ninth squad leader was leading soldiers in gymnastics, some people were not serious enough. Zeng Mulin severely criticized everyone present, making everyone very unhappy. The soldiers said, "The platoon leader is such a chatterbox; he makes such a big fuss over such a small thing without even investigating the situation, and he punishes everyone indiscriminately!" He also rarely consulted with squad leaders and soldiers about the work in the platoon. When launching the "Five Goods" campaign, he drafted the plan by himself and then gathered everyone to say, "I'll read it, and you listen." The soldiers felt that there was nothing to discuss and could only raise their hands to pass it. Zeng Mulin also knew that his comrades had opinions about him, but he always thought, "As long as I'm doing it for the work, what does it matter if my way of speaking is a bit rigid!" Therefore, he didn't take the opinions of the masses to heart. The soldiers were not in a good mood, and their enthusiasm for work was not high enough.

In order to thoroughly understand the situation of the third platoon, the company commander served as a soldier in the eighth squad for a month, and the political instructor also went deep into the platoon to understand and study the situation. After analysis, the company leadership firmly believed that the leadership style of the third platoon leader, Zeng Mulin, must be improved. At this time, it was also Zeng Mulin's turn to serve as a soldier for a month, and in order to make Zeng Mulin aware of his shortcomings, the leadership decided that he would serve as a soldier in the ninth squad of his own platoon. The life of a soldier gave Zeng Mulin a great education. Before a squad meeting, new recruit Chen Qi and several other comrades were casually discussing something. One soldier asked, "If we become a 'Five Goods' unit, does that count as a meritorious service?" Chen Qi replied, "Of course, a 'Five Goods' unit is at least a third-class merit." Ninth squad leader Ning Xianxiang immediately criticized Chen Qi sternly, "What right do you have to talk nonsense like that?" Chen Qi's face turned red, and the other soldiers also drooped their heads. Zeng Mulin felt at the time that the ninth squad leader's rude attitude was very bad and wanted to offer his opinion, but he thought that during his time as a soldier, he was a soldier and should respect his leader, so he didn't speak. After the meeting, he talked to Chen Qi. Chen Qi said, "Platoon leader, you saw it; that's how the ninth squad leader treats a soldier. I won't say anything anymore." Zeng Mulin explained to Chen Qi while feeling ashamed: "Wasn't I treating soldiers like this before? The ninth squad leader's rude style may have been influenced by me!" He deeply realized how easily a rude attitude could hurt a soldier's self-esteem. After finishing his time as a soldier, he wrote a reflection titled "Real Equality." In the article, he made a thorough examination of his previous leadership style. He also said in the article: A leadership style that isn't democratic shows a lack of a strong mass perspective; a rude attitude towards comrades is a manifestation of a lack of class feelings.

From then on, Zeng Mulin paid attention to improving his leadership style in everything he did. When drafting the "Five Goods" plan, he first called a platoon meeting to mobilize everyone, study the "Five Goods" conditions, and then hold a meeting to discuss. During the discussion, Zeng Mulin himself took notes, and finally summarized and organized everyone's opinions, passed them at the general meeting, and made them the entire platoon's "Five Goods" plan. Then, the unit accepted the task of carrying out engineering work in a certain area, and the first thing to do was to open up a section of land. At that time, the vast majority of comrades in the platoon said that this task could be completed in four days, but only the eighth squad leader did not have confidence. Zeng Mulin gathered the squad leaders together, analyzed the situation, calculated the costs, and opened up the eighth squad leader's thinking. During the calculations, Zeng Mulin also asked everyone to point out the difficulties. Everyone believed that the main difficulty was that several new comrades lacked experience and skills. In order to overcome this difficulty, Zeng Mulin proposed carrying out "package teaching and learning" activities. He himself had poor skills, so he humbly learned skills from veteran soldier Tian Jingshan, and the new comrades also found teachers. Everyone learned while working, and their morale was very high. As a result, not only did they complete the first step of the task in four days, but they also built the work sheds. The vast majority of comrades in the entire work team learned the techniques of hammering, drill holding, and using fire tools through "package teaching and learning." After completing this task, Zeng Mulin and everyone studied together and drew up a monthly leap forward plan. Because the plan was drawn up by everyone, the soldiers' sense of responsibility and enthusiasm were greatly improved. Whenever a problem occurred in the work, the soldiers automatically proposed: "Let's have a meeting and discuss it."

With the change in the platoon leader's leadership style, the democratic atmosphere in the platoon was strengthened. The construction tunneling speed also increased from 0.93 meters in eight hours to more than one meter, reaching a maximum of 1.6 meters, and no accidents occurred. At the same time, the entire platoon was united, so they won the "Advanced Work Team" red flag for three consecutive times.

    一个排长的作风转变后
    和谷岩
    人民解放军实行干部当兵制度后，使官兵关系更加亲密了，某部一连三排长曾木林就因为经过这种当兵的锻炼，改进了领导作风，从而使全排出现了人人心情舒畅，个个干劲十足，上下之间更加亲密团结的新气象。
    过去，这个部队的三排长曾木林对党忠实，工作肯干，但处理问题有些主观；执行任务坚决不苟，但处理问题的方式有些生硬，作风不够民主。战士有点不对，他往往不能耐心说服，而是一味批评。有一次，九班长带领战士作体操，有人不太严肃，曾木林正言厉色地把所有在场的人批评了一通，闹得大家很不痛快。战士们说：“排长真是碎嘴子，这点小事还发那么大火，也不调查调查，一棒子打一群！”对排里的工作，他也较少同班长、战士们商量。开展五好运动，他一个人把计划订好，然后召集大家说：“我念念，你们听听。”战士们觉得这还有啥好研究的，只有举手通过。曾木林也知道同志们对他有意见，但他总认为：“只要我是为了工作，说话方式生硬点算啥！”因此，不把群众的意见放在心上。战士们心情不太舒畅，工作起来劲头就不够大。
    为了彻底摸清三排的情况，连长到八班当了一个月的兵，指导员也深入到排里了解研究情况。经过分析，连领导上确定地认为三排长的领导作风必须改进。这时，也正好轮到了三排长曾木林该当兵一个月，为了让曾木林认识自己的毛病，领导上决定他在本排九班当兵。士兵生活给了曾木林很大的教育。一次开班务会之前，新战士陈奇和另外几个同志一起随便议论，一个战士问：“成了五好单位，算不算立了功？”陈奇回答说：“那当然啦，五好单位起码是三等功。”九班长宁宪祥马上声色俱厉地批评陈奇：“你有什么权利这样瞎说？”把陈奇弄得满面通红，别的战士也搭拉了脑袋。曾木林当时就感到九班长这种粗暴态度很不好，想提意见，又想到当兵期间，自己是个战士，要尊重领导，就没有说话。会后，他找陈奇谈话，陈奇说：“排长，你看到啦，九班长就这样对待一个战士，以后我再也不说话了。”曾木林一面给陈奇解释，一面感到惭愧：“我从前不也是这样对待战士吗？九班长这种粗暴作风也许是受了我的影响！”他深深体会到，粗暴态度是如何地容易伤害战士的自尊心。当兵结束后，他写了一篇感想，题目叫“真正平等”。在文章中，他对自己从前的领导作风作了彻底的检查。他还在文章中说：领导作风不民主，正是群众观念不强；对同志态度粗暴，是缺乏阶级感情的表现。
    从此以后，曾木林就处处注意改进自己的领导作风。订五好计划，他先召集排务会进行动员，学习五好条件，然后再开会讨论。讨论时，曾木林自己作记录，最后把大家的意见加以归纳、整理，在大会上通过，成为全排的五好计划。接着，部队接受了到某地进行工程作业的任务，首先便要开辟一个地段，当时排里绝大多数同志都说这个任务四天就可完成，只有八班长没有信心。曾木林把班长召集起来，分析情况，算细账，打通了八班长的思想。算账中，曾木林还让大家摆困难，大家认为主要困难是几个新同志没经验，没技术。为了克服这个困难，曾木林提议开展包教保学活动。他自己技术差，就虚心向老战士田景山学习技术，新同志也都找好了老师，大家一面干一面学，情绪很高。结果，四天中不但完成了第一步任务，还把工棚修了起来。全作业班绝大多数同志都在包教保学中，学会了打锤、掌钎和使用火具的技术。完成这个任务以后，曾木林又和大家一起研究，订出了月份跃进计划。因为计划是大家订出来的，战士们的责任心和积极性就大大提高了。工作中一发生了问题，战士们就自动提出：“开个会，讨论讨论。”
    随着排长领导作风的转变，排里的民主空气加强了。施工掘进速度也由八小时零点九三米提高到一米以上，最高曾达到一点六米，没有发生过任何事故，同时全排团结好，所以，连续三次获得“先进作业班”的红旗。
