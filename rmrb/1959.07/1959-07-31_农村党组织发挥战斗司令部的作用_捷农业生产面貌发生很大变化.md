Prague, July 30th (by our correspondent) Since the beginning of this year, the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party has vigorously strengthened the Party's leadership over agricultural production, requiring rural Party organizations to become battle headquarters for consolidating and developing large-scale socialist agricultural production.

    Since the CCP Central Committee issued the call in March to strive for a decisive turning point in agricultural production, the Party committees of various states and counties have successively held meetings to specifically study agricultural issues, greatly strengthening and improving leadership over agricultural production, and sending a large number of outstanding cadres to rural areas to help grassroots Party organizations implement the Central Committee's resolutions, and help cooperatives formulate production plans and improve management. Not long ago, the Ostrava State had four hundred Party cadres and workers who went to agricultural cooperatives to work. On the one hand, they publicized the Party's agricultural policy to the peasants, and at the same time, they helped grassroots Party organizations improve their leadership methods and raise their work level. The Markianske Lazne County Party Committee not only sent a large number of cadres to the rural areas, but also promptly summarized and promoted their experiences.

    Due to the strengthening of the Party's leadership in agricultural production, the appearance of agricultural production has changed significantly. This year's spring plowing and sowing was carried out quickly and in a timely manner, and the peasants also vigorously responded to the CCP's call to expand the planting of plant crops, and began to implement intensive cultivation methods in production. At present, Party organizations at all levels are leading the peasants in harvesting summer crops in a tense manner. Many Party cadres are going deep into the fields to specifically grasp the progress of the summer harvest and help cooperatives arrange and organize manpower.

    In order to make the Party organization the core of leading agricultural production, the CCP Central Committee requires that Party organizations be established in all agricultural cooperatives that meet the conditions. At present, 250 agricultural cooperatives across the country have established Party organizations. Party organizations in various states and counties also regard absorbing outstanding members of cooperatives into the Party as one of the ways to strengthen the Party's leadership over agricultural production. Since the beginning of this year, a large number of outstanding members of cooperatives in various states and counties have joined the Party. For example, among the newly admitted Party members in Olomouc State, 600 were members of cooperatives, accounting for 30% of all new Party members.

    农村党组织发挥战斗司令部的作用
    捷农业生产面貌发生很大变化
    本报布拉格30日电　今年以来，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央大力加强党对农业生产的领导，要求农村党组织成为巩固和发展社会主义农业大生产的战斗司令部。
    自从3月捷共中央提出了争取农业生产达到决定性转折的号召后，各州、县党委都陆续召开了专门研究农业问题的会议，大大加强改进对农业生产的领导，并派遣了大批优秀干部到农村去，帮助基层党组织贯彻中央决议，帮助合作社制定生产计划，改善经营。不久前俄斯特拉发州就有四百名党的干部和工人，到农业合作社去进行工作。他们一方面向农民宣传党的农业政策，同时帮助基层党组织改善领导方法，提高工作水平。马基安斯凯拉日?县党委不但派出了大批干部到农村去并及时总结和推广他们的经验。
    由于党对农业生产领导的加强，农业生产的面貌有了显著的改变。今年的春耕春播进行的迅速及时，农民们也都大力响应了捷共所提出的扩大植物作物种植的号召，并且在生产中开始实行精耕细作的方法。目前各级党组织正紧张地领导着农民进行夏收，许多党的干部都深入田间，具体掌握夏收进行的情况，帮助合作社安排和组织人力。
    为了使党组织成为领导农业生产的核心，捷共中央要求凡是有条件的农业合作社都要建立党的组织。目前全国已有二百五十个农业社建立了党组织，各州、县党组织也把吸收优秀社员入党作为加强党对农业生产领导的途径之一。今年以来，各州、县都有大批优秀的合作社社员入党，如阿罗木次州新吸收的党员中，有六百名是合作社社员，占全部新党员的30％。
