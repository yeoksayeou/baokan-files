    Today's Qamdo

    Qamdo city, on the banks of the Lancang River, is the political and economic center of eastern Tibet. As early as a thousand years ago, it was the passage from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces into Tibet. Goods produced in the interior, such as tea, silk, and porcelain, were transported to various parts of Tibet through here. In October 1950, the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet liberated this city. Since then, the central government has vigorously helped the Tibetan people here develop agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce, build roads, open hospitals, build schools, and set up factories..., which has rapidly changed the old backwardness of this ancient city.

          In the New City Area

    On a vast open space on the west bank of the Lancang River, a brand-new city has already begun to take shape. Wide streets are lined with neat, towering buildings. Here, there are trading companies, banks, bookstores, schools, etc., that directly serve the Tibetan people. Since 1953, when the Kangzang Highway, known as the "Golden Bridge" by the Tibetan people, was opened to traffic here, large-scale construction began. Up to now, the newly built housing area has reached more than 50,000 square meters, which is more than twice the total area of the old city. The neat and beautiful new city area faces the old city across the river.

    Inside the trading company building in the new city area, it is often crowded with customers who can freely choose from various goods transported from the interior, such as tea, clothing, tools, and food. Recently, the trading company's turnover has been increasing month by month, and there are more and more Tibetan customers. A Tibetan woman named Quji took her two children to the trading company to buy three sets of clothing, four bricks of tea, and two pounds of candy. Her husband started working on a construction site two months ago and earns more than 60 yuan a month. The family's life has improved, and they no longer have to worry about food and clothing. Quji and her husband were originally serfs. Speaking of their past life, she said that they could only eat two bowls of clear water zanba every day. They couldn't afford tea, so they boiled tree leaves in water and added salt to drink as tea. Now it is different, and she is a frequent customer of the trading company. The development of production and the gradual improvement of the people's living standards have brought new prosperity to the Qamdo market. Recently, the trading company is preparing to transfer a large number of goods from the interior, mainly daily necessities, non-staple food, cloth, tea, fruits and other commodities loved by the Tibetan people, to meet their growing needs.

    In the new city area, there is a well-equipped primary school with more than 200 Tibetan primary school students, most of whom are children from poor families. Among these children who listen attentively in class and jump and play happily on the sports field, many are shepherds who have just laid down their whips. Now they are living a happy childhood in school. The school provides enough living allowances for students from poor families. Jiangba Genqing, a second-grade student, is a child from a poor family. Not long ago, his father was killed by the rebels. The child was frowning all day long and was very sad. The teachers in the school often stayed with him, giving him meticulous care and attention from learning to life, and the government gave his family a living allowance every month. Now, Jiangba Genqing has become active again and has become the most outstanding child in the class. Recently, he also joined the Young Pioneers and became a squadron leader. Before the Tibetan rebellion, some reactionaries secretly obstructed and threatened the masses from sending their children to school, which caused some difficulties in school enrollment. After the rebellion was quelled, the situation completely changed. Now, two months before the start of the next semester, more than 200 households have brought their children to the school to ask the teachers to accept them. In order to meet the needs of the masses, the school plans to double its size in the next semester this year.

    Every afternoon, in the new city area, you can see many Tibetan workers singing brisk Tibetan songs in twos and threes after get off work and going home; children who have finished school, carrying their schoolbags, jumping and playing; farmers and herdsmen from the countryside, driving livestock loaded with supplies, galloping across the street on horseback. In the past, these people had never held their heads high. They were always careful when they went out on the street. When they encountered serf owners or reactionary officials passing by, they had to stand by the roadside, bow their heads and stick out their tongues, or avoid them from a distance.

        New Sprouts

    The ancient Qamdo has now emerged with a number of modern small factories, which directly serve local production, construction, and people's lives. There are power plants, cement plants, brick and tile factories, and wood processing plants. The term "factory" was still a strange word to the local people not long ago. In the past, there were only dozens of shops and a few simple handicraft producers here. Even a nail had to be supplied from other places. A long time ago, people expressed their fantasies in folk songs: "When the colorful sun rises in the sky, the earth will become a treasure house with everything, wool like white clouds, tall buildings like stars." Now the fantasy is gradually becoming a reality, bright electric lights have replaced the dim butter lamps, and the roar of machines can be heard here. With the establishment of factories, a local Tibetan workers' team is growing and expanding. Now there are more than 500 Tibetan workers, most of whom were serfs or vagrants in the past. Now more than half of them have become skilled workers and have mastered advanced production technology. In the brick and tile factory and wood processing plant, except for individual Han workers who provide technical guidance and assistance, Tibetan workers account for more than 90%. Bricklayer Sangdo's skills have improved particularly quickly. Recently, he created a high record of producing 950 brick blanks per day, becoming a model for workers in the entire factory to learn from. More than ten years ago, because he couldn't afford the corvee labor, his family fled in all directions. He carried a wooden bowl for begging and a dog-beating stick. During the busy farming season, he worked odd jobs for others in exchange for a full meal, and usually relied on begging to make a living. Three years ago, Sangdo came to the brick and tile factory as a worker. Since then, he has had a fixed job and started a new life. Now he is married, and his wife is also a worker. He often says to people: "Thinking about the past and looking at the present, how can people not work hard." He always goes to work earlier than others every day, and when it's time to get off work, he still secretly does more work for a while before going home.

      A New Life Begins

    Qamdo city is full of joyful and free songs everywhere. In the cheers of celebrating the victory of quelling the rebellion in Tibet, neighborhood committees have been established in all streets. Qunjue, who had been a family slave for nobles for more than 20 years, is now the director of a neighborhood committee. He is very busy now, visiting households from morning to night, organizing residents to hold meetings and study. Qunjue came from a serf family. When he was eight years old, both of his parents died under the whip of the serf owner, and he became an orphan, shouldering heavy labor. He once fled from Lhasa to Qamdo, but still did not escape the clutches of the serf system. For decades, he had been living a humble life, daring not to speak loudly, daring not to straighten his back. From his curved body, wrinkled face, and numerous scars, you can see the traces left by the past suffering life. The current Qunjue has completely changed. He talks and laughs, is full of energy, and works tirelessly. Residents of the entire street like to talk to him when they have problems. Qunjue said: "Now I have seen the clear sky and seen the sun."

    今日昌都
    澜沧江边的昌都城，是康藏高原东部的政治、经济中心。早在千多年前，这里就是川滇两省入藏孔道，内地出产的茶叶、丝绸、瓷器等商品，都是经过这里运往西藏各地。1950年10月，人民解放军进藏部队解放了这个城市。自那时起中央就大力帮助这里的藏族人民发展农牧工商业，修公路、开医院、建学校、办工厂……，使这座古城迅速改变了旧日的落后面貌。
          在新市区
    澜沧江西岸一片开阔的空地上，一座崭新的城市已经初具规模，宽阔的大街两旁，整齐地排列着高耸的楼房，这里有直接为藏族人民服务的贸易公司、银行、书店、学校等等。自从1953年，被藏族人民称为“金桥”的康藏公路通车到这里以后，就开始了较大规模的建设，到现在，新建房屋面积已达五万多平方米，比旧城总面积大一倍多，整齐、漂亮的新市区恰巧与旧城隔江相望。
    在新市区贸易公司的大楼里，经常挤满了顾客，他们可以在这里随意选购到从内地运来的茶叶、衣料、工具、食物等各种商品。最近，贸易公司的营业额逐月上升，藏族顾客越来越多。一位名叫曲吉的藏族妇女，牵着两个孩子到贸易公司里选购了三套衣料，还买了四块砖茶、两斤糖果，她的丈夫两个月前在一处建筑工地上当了工人，每月有六十多元的工资，全家的生活改善了，从此不愁吃穿。曲吉夫妇原来是一户农奴。提起过去的生活，她说每天只能吃到两碗清水糌粑，买不起茶叶，就用树叶熬水加盐当茶喝。现在可不同了，她已是贸易公司里常见的顾客。生产的发展和群众生活水平的逐步提高，给昌都市场带来了新的繁荣，最近，贸易公司正准备从内地调运大批物资，主要是日用百货、副食品、布匹、茶果等藏族人民喜爱的商品，来满足他们日益增长的需要。
    新市区里有一所设备完善的小学，二百多个藏族小学生大部分是贫苦家庭的子女。这些在课堂上专心听讲、在运动场上欢蹦乱跳的孩子当中，不少是刚放下羊鞭的牧童。现在他们在学校里过着幸福的童年生活，对家庭贫困的学生，学校都发给足够吃穿的助学金。二年级的降巴根青是个贫苦人家的孩子，不久前他的父亲被叛乱分子杀害了，这个孩子整天愁眉苦脸，十分悲伤，学校的老师们便经常跟他在一起，从学习到生活对他无微不至的关怀和照顾，政府每月给他家里发生活补助费。现在，降巴根青又重新活跃起来，而且成为全班学习成绩最优秀的儿童，最近他还加入了少先队，当了中队长。西藏叛乱发生以前，一些反动分子暗中阻挠和威胁，不准群众送子女上学，给学校招生造成一些困难。叛乱平定以后，情况就完全变了，现在离下半年开学时间还有两个月，可是带着子女到学校里来请求老师接收入学的已有二百多户，为了满足群众的要求，学校在今年下学期准备扩大一倍。
    每天下午，在新市区里可以看到许多下班的藏族工人三三两两地唱着轻快的藏歌，走回家去；放学的儿童，挎着书包，蹦蹦跳跳地玩耍；来自乡村的农、牧民，赶着驮满物资的牲口，跨马驰过大街。过去，这些人从来没有扬眉吐气过，出门上街总是小心翼翼，碰到农奴主或反动官员走过，就得侍立道旁低头吐舌或是远相回避。
        新的萌芽
    古老的昌都，现在已经出现了一批近代化的小型工厂，这些工厂都是直接为当地的生产建设和人民生活服务，有发电厂、水泥厂、砖瓦厂、木料加工厂等。“工厂”这个名词，在不久以前对当地人民还是一个陌生的字眼。过去这里只有几十家店铺和几家简陋的手工业生产者，连一根铁钉也要靠外地供应。很早以前，人们就在民歌中表达过自己的幻想：“天空升起五彩太阳的时候，地上就会变成应有尽有的宝库，羊毛像白云，高楼像星星。”如今幻想正在逐步变为现实，明亮的电灯代替了半明半暗的酥油灯，这里也听到了机器的轰鸣。随着工厂的建立，一支当地的藏族工人队伍正在成长和壮大。现在已有藏族工人五百多人，他们大多是过去的农奴或流浪者，现在半数以上的人已经成为技术工人，掌握了先进的生产技术。在砖瓦厂和木料加工厂里，除了在技术上进行指导和帮助的个别汉族工人外，藏族工人占90％以上。制砖工人桑多技术提高得特别快，最近他创造了日产砖坯九百五十块的高额纪录，成为全厂工人学习的榜样。他十多年前，由于支不起乌拉，举家四散逃亡，他带着一个讨饭的木碗和一根打狗棒，农忙时候，给别人打零工，以求一饱，平时只靠乞讨度日。三年前，桑多来砖瓦厂当上了工人，从此有了固定的工作，开始了新的生活，现在他已经结了婚，妻子也是工人。他时常对人说：“想起过去，看看现在，怎不叫人拚命工作。”他每天总是比别人提前上班，下班时间到了，他还要偷偷地多干一会才回家。
      新生活开始了
    昌都城里，到处是欢乐和自由的歌声。在欢庆西藏平叛胜利欢呼声中，各条街道都建立了居民委员会，曾经给贵族当了二十多年家奴的群觉，现在是一个居民委员会的主任，他现在工作非常忙，从早到晚地挨家挨户访问，组织居民开会、学习。群觉出身农奴家庭，八岁时，父母都在农奴主的皮鞭下死于非命，成了孤儿，开始负担起沉重的劳役。他曾经从拉萨到昌都辗转逃亡，但还是没有逃出农奴制度的魔掌。几十年来，他一直过着低声下气的日子，不敢大声讲话，不敢挺直腰走路，从他弯曲的身躯、满脸的绉纹、累累的伤疤，可以看出过去苦难生活留下的痕迹。现在的群觉完全变了样，有说有笑，精神焕发，工作起来不知疲倦，全街的居民一有问题都喜欢找他谈。群觉说：“现在我才见了青天，看到太阳了。”
