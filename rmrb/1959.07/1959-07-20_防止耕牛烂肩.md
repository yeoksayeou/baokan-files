    Preventing Sores on Oxen Shoulders
    After the spring plowing season, the busy season of summer harvesting and planting follows, and oxen bear a considerable workload. At this time, it is especially important to strengthen the feeding and management of oxen.
    It is understood that a small number of production teams and commune members here only focus on using the oxen, but do not pay enough attention to feeding and management. As a result, many oxen develop sores on their shoulders. In the Xiong Huobu Brigade of our Canggang Commune in Hanshou County, seventeen out of the one hundred and twenty oxen capable of working can no longer be used due to shoulder sores. In the Xinxing Brigade, nineteen out of the one hundred and fifty oxen also have shoulder sores. This has greatly affected current production. Therefore, it is suggested that all localities quickly take effective measures to prevent and treat shoulder sores on oxen.
    How can we prevent shoulder sores on oxen? I offer the following suggestions for reference: First, it is best to assign a specific person to use the ox. Do not change users arbitrarily, so as to avoid unfamiliarity with the ox's habits and unreasonable usage. Second, the size and width of the plow yoke, and the length of the neck strap should be appropriate to avoid damaging the skin and muscles of the ox's shoulder. Third, it is best to make a ball of hair and wrap it inside the plow yoke near the ox's shoulder; or burn seashells into ash and grind them into a fine powder. First, sprinkle it on the ox's shoulder, and then put on the plow yoke. This can reduce friction and prevent shoulder sores. Of course, there may be some better methods in various places, as long as we pay attention to it and strengthen our sense of responsibility, we can prevent shoulder sores on oxen. For oxen that already have shoulder sores, they should be treated in a timely manner so that the oxen can be put into production as soon as possible.

### 防止耕牛烂肩

    防止耕牛烂肩
    春耕生产过后，紧接着是大忙的夏收夏种季节，耕牛负担的劳役相当繁重。这时候要特别加强耕牛的饲养管理工作。
    据了解，我们这里有少数生产队和社员，对耕牛只顾使用，而饲养管理工作却重视不够。结果，不少耕牛发生烂肩现象。我们汉寿县沧港公社的熊火卜大队，在能服劳役的一百二十头耕牛当中，已有十七头因烂肩而不能使用。在新兴大队的一百五十头耕牛当中，也有十九头耕牛发生烂肩。这样就大大影响了当前的生产。因此，建议各地赶紧采取有效措施，防止和医治耕牛的烂肩现象。
    怎样防止耕牛烂肩呢？我提出以下几点意见，供参考：一、最好固定专人使用，不要随意换人用牛，以免对耕牛习性不熟悉，发生不合理的使役。二、犁桠的大小、宽窄，颈项下的绊索的长短，均要合宜，以免损伤耕牛肩部的皮肤和肌肉。三、最好用头发丝做成团子，缠在犁桠里面接近牛肩的地方；或用贝壳烧灰，研成细末。先撒在耕牛肩上，然后再套犁桠。这样，可以减少磨擦，防止烂肩。当然，各地还会有一些更好的办法，只要我们重视起来，加强责任心，就可以防止耕牛烂肩。对于已经烂肩的耕牛，要及时医治，好使耕牛早日投入生产。
