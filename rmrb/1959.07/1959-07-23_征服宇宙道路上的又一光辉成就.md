Another Glorious Achievement on the Road to Conquering the Universe
He Qingzhi, Associate Professor of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics

Following the launch of three artificial satellites and a cosmic rocket, the Soviet Union successively launched two huge geophysical ballistic rockets carrying animals on July 2nd and 10th this year, with all scientific instruments and experimental animals landing safely. This great achievement marks another major step forward for mankind in exploring the mysteries of nature and in the path towards space navigation.

The rockets launched by the Soviet Union this time have three characteristics: first, the effective payload (scientific instruments and experimental animals) weighed more than two tons, practically a complex airborne comprehensive laboratory; second, a rescue system was used to safely bring all scientific instruments and animals back to the ground; third, what was launched this time was not an ordinary high-altitude exploration rocket, but a geophysical ballistic rocket.

As everyone knows, to launch a rocket to a certain height (or to reach a certain range), the larger the effective payload it carries, the more technically difficult it is. It requires more sophisticated mechanisms and more powerful rocket engines; and the creation of powerful rocket engines, in turn, means solving a series of complex technical problems. According to simple calculations, the energy required to send such a heavy load into space (not including the energy required to accelerate the rocket shell itself) is about fifty to sixty thousand times the kinetic energy of a speeding car. When the level of rocket technology is relatively low, high-altitude rockets can only carry a small amount of scientific instruments to conduct single scientific studies and obtain a small amount of data and information. Only when rocket technology develops to a very high level is it possible to launch such a huge geophysical rocket like the Soviet Union, conduct so many research experiments, and obtain so much scientific data at once.

Since artificial satellites and cosmic rockets have been launched into space one after another, space navigation is no longer just people's fantasy, but is about to become a reality. However, to send people to navigate in outer space, a series of problems must be solved. One of the important issues is how to safely return to Earth. Although cosmic rockets have technically solved the problem of "sending" people up, until the problem of "sending them back" is solved, human space navigation will ultimately remain just an enticing ideal.

We know that when a rocket is launched, it gradually accelerates from a stationary state, and this acceleration is not very large. Therefore, its speed in the dense atmosphere is relatively low, and the rocket body will not generate high temperatures due to air friction. When the rocket returns to the ground, it "plunges" into the dense atmosphere at a very high speed. Air molecules near the rocket's outer shell can reach very high temperatures due to friction with the shell's surface. Theoretical calculations show that when an intercontinental ballistic rocket plunges into the atmosphere at a speed of six to seven kilometers per second, the temperature of the air on the surface of the rocket shell can be as high as tens of thousands of degrees Celsius if no special measures are taken.

Another aspect of the problem is that when a rocket "plunges" into the atmosphere at high speed, it encounters great air resistance due to the presence of dense air (air resistance is roughly proportional to air density and proportional to the square of flight speed), thus generating great deceleration (just like a car braking sharply). All parts of the rocket are subjected to great inertial forces, which is what is commonly called "overweight" or "overload," meaning that each part has to withstand a force several or even dozens of times greater than its own weight. Biological beings have a certain limit to how much "overload" they can withstand. For example, experiments have shown that experienced pilots who have undergone training can generally withstand "overloads" of no more than ten for a short period of time, meaning they cannot withstand a force more than ten times their own weight, otherwise they will lose consciousness. Even if the "overload" exceeds four, the pilot's vision will be impaired, and the limit for enduring "overload" for a long time is even lower. To ensure that people can return safely after space navigation, the above problems must be solved.

In recent years, due to scientific and military requirements, the problem of rockets re-entering the atmosphere and landing on the ground has become one of the most interesting problems for scientists and engineers in various countries.

There may be various ways to solve this problem. In the past, parachutes were generally used to bring experimental animals back to the ground from high altitudes. Using parachutes has its limits. When the effective payload is large, the flight altitude is high, and the speed is high, using parachutes becomes very difficult. If the effective payload reaches two tons, the parachute needed to land it at a safe speed would be unimaginably huge.

Retro-rocket propulsion can also be used to send sealed capsules containing animals (or humans) back to the ground. When a spacecraft or an artificial satellite orbiting needs to "go home," the control system causes it to return to Earth. At a certain distance from Earth, the retro-rocket engine can be activated to decelerate it. The speed when passing through the atmosphere has become very low, so it will not overheat or encounter a large overload, and finally it will safely return to the ground. Of course, solving this problem in practice is much more complicated. The trajectory control of the "return" rocket, the design and manufacture of long-working rocket engines, and the mastery of high-energy fuels (including nuclear fuels) are all problems that must be solved first.

Even if these problems are solved, the problem of rockets re-entering the atmosphere will only be truly solved after having the correct rocket head shape design, adopting new structural forms, and having high-temperature and high-strength materials.

The fact that the Soviet Union's geophysical rocket launched this time can safely bring back an effective payload weighing more than two tons (including higher organisms) indicates that brilliant achievements have been made in this area of research.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the Soviet Union launched a geophysical ballistic rocket this time. Unlike ordinary high-altitude rockets, it can not only measure geophysical data within a limited range, but also conduct measurements within a considerable space. This requires more accurate trajectory calculations and control. At present, ballistic rockets in various countries around the world are military-use. Applying ballistic rockets to peaceful purposes is still an innovation.

    征服宇宙道路上的又一光辉成就
    北京航空学院副教授　何庆芝　赵震炎
    继三个人造卫星、一支宇宙火箭上天之后，苏联在今年7月2日和10日又连续发射了两个巨大的、带有动物的地球物理弹道火箭，全部科学仪器和试验动物安全着陆。这一伟大成就，标志着人类在探索自然奥秘，在通向宇宙航行的道路上又迈进了一大步。
    苏联这次所发射的火箭有三个特点：第一，有效载荷（科学仪器和试验动物）重达两吨以上，简直是一座复杂的空中综合试验室；第二，用救护系统把全部科学仪器和动物安全地降回地面；第三，这次发射的不是一般的高空探测火箭，而是地球物理弹道火箭。
    大家都知道，发射一支火箭到一定的高度（或达到一定的射程），所带的有效载荷愈大，在技术上愈困难，它要求更完善的机构，更强大的火箭发动机；而强大的火箭发动机的制成，则又意味需要解决一系列复杂的技术问题。根据简单推算，把这样重的载荷送上天，所需要的能量（尚不包括加速火箭壳体本身所需要的能量）约为一辆飞奔着的小汽车动能的五、六万倍。当火箭技术水平比较低时，高空火箭只能带少量的科学仪器，作单项的科学研究，获得少量的数据和资料。只有火箭技术发展到很高水平时，才可能发射像苏联这样庞大的地球物理火箭，进行那样多的研究试验，一次获得那样多的科学资料。
    自从人造卫星、宇宙火箭相继上天之后，宇宙航行已经不仅是人们的幻想，而即将成为现实。但是，要人们到宇宙空间去航行，还要解决一系列的问题。其中的一个重要问题是如何安全地降回地球上来。宇宙火箭虽已从技术上解决了把人们“送上去”的问题，但在“送回来”的问题没有解决之前，人类的宇宙航行终归还只是一个诱人的理想。
    我们知道，火箭发射上去时，它是从静止状态逐渐加速的，而且这种加速度并不很大。因此，它在稠密大气中飞行的速度比较低，不会因空气的摩擦而使火箭体产生高温，当火箭回到地面来时，它是以很大的速度“冲入”稠密大气层。火箭外壳附近的空气分子由于和壳体表面的摩擦，这部分空气可以达到很高的温度。理论计算表明，当洲际弹道火箭以每秒六至七公里的速度冲入大气层，如果不采用特殊措施时，火箭壳体表面空气的温度可高到上万度。
    还有问题的另一方面，当火箭以高速“冲入”大气层时，由于稠密空气的存在，它会遇到很大的空气阻力（空气阻力大体上和空气密度成正比，和飞行速度的平方成正比），因而产生很大的减速（就像汽车急刹车一样），火箭上所有部分都要受很大的惯性力，这就是平常所谓的“超重”，或“过载”，也就是说各部分都要承受比本身重量大几倍甚至几十倍的力量。生物承受“过载”是有一定限度的，例如，实验证明，经过训练的有经验的飞机驾驶员短时间所能忍受的“过载”一般不能超过十，也就是不能忍受超过本身重量十倍的力量，否则会失去知觉，即使“过载”超过四，驾驶员的视觉也会失常，长时间忍受“过载”的限度那就更低了。要使人们宇宙航行后能安全归来，必须解决上述问题。
    近些年来，由于科学上和军事上的要求，火箭重回大气层并降落地面的问题已成为各国科学家和工程师们最感兴趣的问题之一。
    解决这个问题的方法可能是各种各样的。以前一般是用降落伞把试验动物从高空降回地面。用降落伞有一定的限度，当有效载荷很大，飞行的高度很高，速度很大，用伞就发生了很大的困难，如果有效载荷达到两吨，要使它以安全的速度着陆，所需要的伞将要庞大到难以想象。
    也可以用反推力火箭把载有动物（或人）的密封舱送回地面。当宇宙飞船或在轨道上运行的人造卫星需要“回家”的时候，控制系统使它向地球返航。在离地球某一距离时，就可以开动反推力发动机使它减速，在通过大气层时的速度已经变得很低，因此就不会过热和遇到很大的过载，最后安全降回地面。要在实践上解决这个问题，当然要复杂得多，像“返航”火箭的弹道控制，长时间工作的火箭发动机的设计制造，高能燃料（包括核子燃料）的掌握等，都是首先要解决的问题。
    即使解决了这些问题，还要有正确的火箭头部外形的设计，采用新型的结构形式并有耐高温高强度的材料以后，火箭重新回到大气层的问题才算真正解决了。
    这次苏联发射的地球物理火箭，能把重达两吨多的有效载荷（其中包括高等生物）安全降回地面，表明在这方面的研究已取得辉煌的成果。
    最后，值得提出的是苏联这次发射的是地球物理弹道火箭，它不像一般高空火箭那样只能测得有限范围内的地球物理资料，而且能够在相当大的空间内进行测量。这就要求更精确的进行弹道计算和控制。目前，世界各国的弹道火箭都是军用的，把弹道火箭应用到和平用途，这还是一个创举。
