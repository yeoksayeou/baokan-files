Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 17th. The National Committee of the Communist Party of India, after holding a four-day meeting in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala, passed a resolution on the 16th expressing its disagreement with the Congress Party's proposal to hold a new general election in Kerala.

The resolution pointed out that the Congress Party's proposal "attempts to force the Kerala government to surrender to the violent, unconstitutional agitation directed by vested interest groups and the pressure of interference from the central government." The purpose of the proposal is "to deprive the Kerala government of the time to implement its progressive economic and social reforms, thereby depriving it of the opportunity to fulfill its promises to the voters." The resolution pointed out that this proposal "is merely another form of interference by the central government and an attempt to put a democratic cloak on it."

The resolution pointed out that the Congress Party leaders hold a biased and discriminatory attitude and are not prepared to tolerate the only non-Congress progressive government among the fourteen states of India, which is why they put forward this proposal.

The resolution further pointed out that the real issue is that the Congress Party "is forcing the only non-Congress progressive government to re-obtain the mandate of the voters by unconvincing and unconstitutional means, while at the same time allowing its own governments in other states to continue to govern, even though they clearly do not have the support of the majority of voters in the states."

The resolution criticized the Congress Party and other opposition parties for openly inciting the people to take violent and bloody actions. It said: "Burning schools and destroying school property in the name of picketing, attacking students and teachers, throwing stones at buses, and seriously injuring peaceful citizens – these are the methods and tactics adopted by the opposition parties." The resolution said that the opposition parties, out of blind anti-communism, have formed an alliance with religious and caste-based anti-communist forces. The resolution also pointed out that this is being disguised in the name of a "people's uprising."

The resolution reiterated its proposal to sit down and negotiate with all opposition parties in order to resolve the current crisis.

The resolution expressed satisfaction with the unity of the people of India in defending the Kerala government and hoped that all democratic public opinion would continue the movement to defend the Kerala government and put pressure on the Congress Party leaders to stop the agitation and prevent the central government from interfering.

The National Committee of the Communist Party of India has decided to hold demonstrations in the capitals of all states on August 3 to mobilize the masses and public opinion to oppose the central government's interference in Kerala.

According to the Press Trust of India, Trivandrum, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, Ajoy Ghosh, explained at a mass meeting on the evening of the 16th, regarding the resolution passed by the National Committee on the same day, that there is no other way to resolve the current situation in Kerala except through negotiations to seek a solution.

Ghosh said: "If anyone thinks that their intimidation tactics can force the Kerala government to resign, then they will not get their wish, because we have the support of the working class, farmers, and the ordinary people of this state, and the support of democratic public opinion throughout the country."

### 印共全国委员会通过决议  不同意在喀拉拉邦重新选举

    印共全国委员会通过决议
    不同意在喀拉拉邦重新选举
    新华社新德里17日电　印度共产党全国委员会在喀拉拉邦首府特里凡得琅举行了四天的会议以后，在16日通过决议，表示不同意国大党提出的关于在喀拉拉邦重新举行大选的建议。
    决议指出，国大党的这项建议“企图使喀拉拉邦政府在既得利益集团指挥下的、强暴的、违反宪法的煽动运动和中央政府进行干涉的压力面前投降”。建议的目的是“使喀拉拉邦政府没有时间去实现它的进步的经济和社会改革，从而使它没有机会去履行它对选民所作的保证”。决议指出，这项建议“只不过是中央政府进行干涉的另一种形式以及把民主的外衣披在它外面的一种企图”。
    决议指出，国大党领袖们抱有偏私和歧视的态度，他们对印度十四个邦之中仅有的一个非国大党的进步政府也不准备加以容忍，因此才提出了这项建议。
    决议进一步指出，真正的问题是，国大党“以不能令人信服的、违宪的手段强迫唯一的非国大党进步政府来重新取得选民的委托，而同时它却让在其它各邦中它自己的政府继续执政，尽管他们显然在各邦内没有获得大多数选民的支持。”
    决议批评国大党和其它反对党公开煽动人民采取暴力和流血行为。它说：“以进行纠察活动为名烧毁学校和破坏学校的财物，袭击学生和教员，用石块投掷公共汽车，使和平公民受重伤——这些是反对党采用的方法和策略。”决议说，反对党出于盲目的反共，同教族反共力量结成了联盟。决议还指出，这是在以“人民起义”的名义来加以掩饰的。
    决议再次建议同所有的反对党坐下来谈判，以便解决目前的危机。
    决议对印度全国人民联合起来保卫喀拉拉邦政府表示满意，并且希望一切民主舆论继续进行保卫喀拉拉邦政府的运动，对国大党领袖施加压力来制止煽动运动和使中央不要进行干涉。
    印度共产党全国委员会已经决定在8月3日在全国各邦首府举行示威，动员群众和舆论来反对中央政府干涉喀拉拉邦。
    据印度报业托辣斯特里凡得琅消息，印度共产党总书记高士16日晚间在一次群众大会上解释全国委员会在当天通过的决议说，除了进行谈判以求得解决以外，没有其他办法能够解决目前喀拉拉邦的局势。
    高士说：“如果有人认为，他们的恫吓策略能够迫使喀拉拉邦政府辞职，那么他们将不会如愿以偿，因为我们获得了工人阶级、农民和这个邦的普通人民的支持，并且获得了全国各地民主舆论的支持。”
