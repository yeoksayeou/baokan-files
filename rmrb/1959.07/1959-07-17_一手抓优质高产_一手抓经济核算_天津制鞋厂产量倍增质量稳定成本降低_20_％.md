    Tianjin Shoe Factory Doubles Output, Stabilizes Quality, and Reduces Costs by 20%
    (Our newspaper Tianjin, 16th dispatch) The Tianjin Shoe Factory rigorously implements the economic accounting system, promptly analyzes the effectiveness of economic activities, and has improved its enterprise management level, thereby promoting production. In the first half of this year, the factory's output doubled compared to the same period last year, and comparable costs decreased by 20.76%; quality has also remained at its past highest level.
    This factory, employing nearly two thousand people, produces men's and women's leather shoes. It began implementing a team-based economic accounting system in 1955. However, prior to the Great Leap Forward last year, the accounting was conducted by workshop cost accountants, which was not very effective. Workers said that at that time, "cadres calculated, and workers watched," resulting in a cold and indifferent team-based accounting. After the Great Leap Forward last year, the Party committee discovered this situation and, after research, decided to mobilize the masses to participate in accounting. However, some cadres feared that the masses would not be able to calculate, so they only assigned the workers to account for raw material consumption, work-hour quotas, and output quality, while the monetary costs were still accounted for by the workshop accountants. As a result, output and quality improved, but costs rose. To completely change this situation, from January this year, the Party Committee of the factory decided to hand over all indicators to the masses for participation in accounting, thereby closely integrating mass-based team accounting with professional accounting, and launching a mass movement of "everyone caring about costs, and everyone calculating carefully."
    In order to enable all workers to participate in economic accounting, the factory determined the focus of accounting based on the characteristics of each work section. For example, the material cutting group in the cutting section is the control point for material consumption for the entire factory, accounting for 70% to 80% of the factory's costs. How to skillfully cut and efficiently plan the leather surface while ensuring quality plays a decisive role in increasing production, saving raw materials, and reducing costs. Therefore, the Party and government leaders of the factory clearly defined the main content of the accounting for all workers in this work section as saving raw materials and reducing planned costs. The sewing and lasting work sections, among others, were tasked with making every effort to improve product quality, save work hours, and reduce the consumption of auxiliary materials. At the same time, a system of pre-shift estimation and post-shift settlement analysis was established to ensure that the group workers completed their plans evenly on a daily and monthly basis. The pre-shift estimation and calculation system requires the group material clerks to calculate the total cost and possible savings for the day before the workers start work, based on the amount of raw materials required for the day's production tasks and the planned unit cost of various products. Then, they rationally allocate materials and announce them to the group workers, so that everyone knows the numbers. After work, a settlement analysis is carried out, and the amount of savings and the completion of various indicators by each person are calculated based on the actual material usage. This is then announced to everyone at the post-shift meeting, pointing out the existing problems and solutions. In this way, workers know not only the annual and monthly targets for increasing production and practicing economy, but also the specific daily figures for increasing production and practicing economy, so that they have a clear understanding.
    The adoption of these measures not only made economic accounting a matter of concern for everyone, but also promoted the further development of technical innovation and technical revolution, and labor emulation throughout the factory, achieving the goals of reducing costs, increasing labor productivity, improving labor organization, and ensuring the comprehensive completion of various economic accounting indicators. For example, when the factory analyzed the cost increases of last year this year, it found that the proportion of personnel in some work sections was not appropriate, resulting in a waste of labor. In response to this situation, each workshop adjusted its labor organization and transferred some labor to support other production departments, increasing labor productivity by 32.5% in the first half of this year. In order to reduce the consumption of raw materials, employees created an advanced operating method of comprehensively cutting leather, "small first, then large; broken first, then whole." The value of raw materials saved in the first half of the year by the entire factory reached more than 390,000 yuan, equivalent to the total savings for the entire year last year. In team accounting, employees also carried out a movement of mutual "learning, comparing, and catching up," making the factory's labor emulation and rationalization proposal movement more active and in-depth. Among the large number of rationalization proposals in the first half of the year, many were suggestions for saving raw materials, improving quality, and reducing costs. As a result, the rework rate of semi-finished products in each workshop was reduced from 12.5% to 30% to 2% to 4%. The quality of fifteen products in the factory, with the exception of one with slightly poorer appearance, maintained the highest level of 1958.
    While strengthening mass-based team accounting and cost management, the factory also closely integrated factory and workshop comprehensive accounting, so that there was both mass-based team accounting and comprehensive economic analysis for the entire factory and workshops. The workshops of the factory established ledgers of main and auxiliary material consumption according to product names. Based on the actual output completed as listed on the daily cost accounting sheets of each group, and the actual amount of various raw materials consumed, the workshop cost accountants carried out comprehensive aggregation on a daily basis. At the end of the month, these ledgers were used to calculate the planned price costs of the main and auxiliary materials of various products. The total price cost of the main and auxiliary materials of various products were adjusted according to the comprehensive price difference rate, and then added to the workers' wages and workshop expenses to obtain the actual workshop cost, plus the enterprise management fee to obtain the actual factory cost. The factory then adjusted according to the planned price cost difference rate of each workshop to become the actual factory cost. Through layer-by-layer accounting and hierarchical management, the basic-level accounting and comprehensive accounting were organically combined. At the same time, a product pre-production trial system, a quality analysis system, a defective product reporting system, a finished product inspection system, and a raw material requisition and return system were established. This promoted improvements in planning management and technical management, formed a comprehensive economic accounting system, and enriched and consolidated the system of worker participation in management, greatly improving the enterprise's management.

    一手抓优质高产
    一手抓经济核算
    天津制鞋厂产量倍增质量稳定成本降低20％
    本报天津16日电　天津制鞋厂严格执行经济核算制，及时分析经济活动效果，提高了企业管理水平，促进了生产。今年上半年这个厂子的产量比去年同期增加了一倍，可比成本降低20.76％；质量也保持在过去的最高水平上。
    这个厂是生产男、女皮鞋的近二千人的厂子，从1955年就开始实行班组经济核算，但在去年大跃进以前，是由车间成本核算员进行核算的，作用不大，工人说那时是干部算工人看，冷冷清清的班组核算。去年大跃进以后，党委发现这一情况，经过研究，决定发动群众参加核算，但有些干部怕群众不会算，只将原材料消耗、工时定额、产量质量等交给工人进行核算，而金额成本仍由车间核算员核算。结果，产量、质量提高，成本却上升。为了彻底改变这种情况，从今年1月起，这个厂的党委会决定把所有指标都交给群众参加核算，从而把群众性的班组核算和专业核算密切结合起来，掀起了“人人关心成本、个个精打细算”的群众运动。
    为了使工人都能参加经济核算，这个厂根据每个工段的特点，确定了核算的重点。如裁断工段的划料小组，是全厂材料消耗的关口，占工厂成本70％至80％，在保证质量的情况下，如何巧裁、巧划皮面，对提高生产、节约原材料、降低成本起着决定性的作用，因此，工厂党、政领导方面给这个工段的全体工人明确核算的主要内容是节约原材料，降低计划成本；而缝帮、?柠等几个工段，是尽一切办法提高产品质量、节约工时，降低辅料消耗等。同时，还建立班前预计测算和班后结算分析制度，保证了小组工人按日、按月均衡完成计划。班前预计测算是工人上班前，小组材料员就按照当日生产任务所需原材料金额数字，和各种产品计划单位成本，测算出当日的总成本和可能节约额，然后合理配料，向小组工人公布，使人人心中有数；下班后进行结算分析，按实际用料情况，算出节约数量和每人完成各项指标的情况，并在班后会上向大家公布，指出存在的问题和解决的办法。这样，工人们既知道全年、全月的增产节约指标，又知道每天的具体增产节约数字，作到心中有数。
    采取这些措施，不仅使经济核算成为大家都关心的事情，而且也推动全厂的技术革新和技术革命、劳动竞赛更进一步的开展，达到降低成本，提高劳动生产率，改善劳动组织，保证全面完成各项经济核算指标的目的。如这个厂今年分析去年成本上升时，发现有些工段人员的比例不相适应，有浪费劳动力的现象，各车间针对这一情况，调整了劳动组织，抽调部分劳动力支援了其他生产部门，使今年上半年的劳动生产率提高了32.5％。职工们为了降低原材料的消耗指标，创造了“先小后大，先碎后整”的综合裁皮子的先进操作法，全厂上半年节约原材料的价值共达三十九万多元，相当于去年全年的节约总值。在班组核算中，职工们还开展了互相“学、比、赶”的运动，使得全厂的劳动竞赛和合理化建议运动更加活跃、深入。在上半年大量的合理化建议中，不少是节约原材料、提高质量、降低成本的建议，因而各个车间的半成品回修率由12.5％到30％降低到2％到4％。全厂十五种产品质量，除一种外观稍差外，其余十四种都保持1958年的最高水平。
    这个厂在加强群众性的班组核算和成本管理的同时，还把工厂车间综合核算紧密结合，作到既有群众性的班组核算，又有全厂、全车间的综合性经济分析。工厂的各车间分别按照产品名称建立主辅材料消耗台账，由车间成本核算员根据各个小组每日成本核算单所列实际完成产量，和实际消耗的各种原材料数量，金额成本，逐日进行综合汇总，月终时以此台账分别计算各种产品主辅材料计划价格成本，根据综合价格差异率调整各种产品的主辅材料价格总成本，然后加上工人工资和车间经费为车间实际成本，再加上企业管理费为工厂实际成本，工厂再按各车间的计划价格成本差异率进行调整成为工厂实际成本。通过层层核算和分级管理，就把基层核算和综合核算有机的结合起来。同时还建立了产品投入生产前试制制度、质量分析制度、残次品的报告制度、成品的检验制度和原材料的领退制度，这就促进了计划管理和技术管理等方面的改善，形成了全面的经济核算制度，并且丰富和巩固工人参加管理的制度，企业管理面貌大为改善。
