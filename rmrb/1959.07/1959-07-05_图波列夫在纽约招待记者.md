Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 2nd (TASS dispatch): Soviet aircraft designer Tupolev held a press conference in New York on the 1st, to talk about his impressions after flying from the Soviet Union to the United States aboard the "Tu-114" turboprop airliner with Soviet First Deputy Premier Kozlov. This aircraft was designed by a large group of Soviet aircraft designers under his leadership.

Tupolev said: "This flight was the first non-stop flight from Moscow to New York. It shows that we live very close to each other, and we need to cooperate closely with each other. One might say that space does not separate us, but brings us closer together."

The "Tu-114" jet airliner took only ten hours and forty-five minutes to fly from the Soviet Union to the United States, while in 1937, Soviet pilots Chkalov and Gromov spent seventy-six hours flying a Tupolev-designed aircraft from the Soviet Union across the North Pole to the United States.

Tupolev said that the Soviet people hope for friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Soviet people advocate worldwide cooperation and the maintenance of peace. Let this flight be a symbol of our friendship, a living line of contact between the two countries.

    图波列夫在纽约招待记者
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约2日讯：苏联著名飞机设计师图波列夫1日在纽约举行了记者招待会，谈了他这次随苏联部长会议第一副主席科兹洛夫乘“图—114”涡轮喷气式客机从苏联飞到美国后的一些感想，这种飞机就是他所领导的一大批苏联飞机设计师设计的。
    图波列夫说：“这次飞行是从莫斯科到纽约的第一次不着陆飞行。它说明了我们住得很邻近，而且，需要互相密切合作。可以这样说，空间不是把我们隔离开而是使我们接近了。”
    “图—114”喷气式客机从苏联飞到美国只花了十小时四十五分钟的时间，而苏联驾驶员契卡洛夫和格罗莫夫在1937年驾驶图波列夫设计的飞机从苏联越过北极飞到美国却花了七十六小时。
    图波列夫说，苏联人民希望苏联和美国之间有友好的关系。苏联人民主张全世界互相合作，维护和平。让这次飞行成为我们友谊的象征，成为两国之间一条活生生的联系线。
