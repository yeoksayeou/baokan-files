    Learning from Good People and Good Deeds
    Yi Huai
    Among the broad masses of grassroots cadres, there are many good comrades like Yang Hongdian of the Shaluo Brigade in the Dayao Commune of Liuyang, Hunan. They serve the masses wholeheartedly, go deep into their work, listen to the opinions of the masses with an open mind, and are hardworking, simple, and devoted. The grassroots comrades in the vast countryside should learn from the comrades in Hunan and take such good people and good deeds as examples and teaching materials for their own learning. Learn their good qualities, good style, and good methods. Party leadership organs should also, like the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, select the best from the good, and strive for excellence, choosing the best from the many good people and good deeds as a model and pacesetter for everyone to learn from. In this way, everyone can learn from the best in terms of ideological style and work methods, and strive to move forward.
    In a reviewing parade, with pacesetters, thousands upon thousands of people have a goal to emulate as they advance. Among grassroots cadres, with good people and good deeds serving as examples for everyone, there are role models to strive for progress. Once learned, the vast number of rural grassroots cadres can understand how to do things well and how things can be done badly. Among the vast number of grassroots workers, many people work hard and want to do more good things for the masses, but sometimes things go against their wishes. They put in effort but spoil things, the masses complain, and they themselves are distressed. This is mostly because these comrades lack experience and methods, coupled with subjective and one-sided thinking and simple work methods. Therefore, when tasks are urgent and heavy, and the situation is relatively complex, they often cannot distinguish between right and wrong, draw clear lines, or understand the relationships and connections between things, and thus do wrong things. For these comrades, if they are only blamed for doing this poorly or that incorrectly, then they will be restrained, afraid to take bold responsibility, and their work may suffer losses. For these comrades, asking them to learn from good people and good deeds is one of the best ways to improve their understanding and improve their work.
    If the Party's mass line exists in the minds of grassroots cadres only as a few principles and articles, and its understanding is not deep and they do not know how to apply it specifically, then it is impossible to truly follow the mass line. Learning from those good people and good deeds who are good at following the mass line can turn the mass line into something with flesh and blood, lively and vivid. Zhang Ruilin, the First Secretary of the Fanjiayuan Commune Party Committee in Xiangyin, Hunan, said that they often pitted strengthening leadership against the mass line in their work. After learning about Yang Hongdian's deeds, they realized that to strengthen leadership, they must follow the mass line well. A mass line without centralized leadership is just tailism, not a true mass line.
    Among the vast number of grassroots cadres, only a very small number, of course, do wrong things. If they learn from good people and good deeds, then they may be able to identify their own shortcomings and the reasons for making mistakes from the good people and good deeds, thereby making it easier to overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes. At the same time, the vast number of grassroots cadres, by learning from good people and good deeds, may be able to inspire their own thinking, thereby clarifying experiences and lessons, further promoting their work, and improving production. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On Practice": "We cannot immediately understand the things we feel; only the things we understand can we feel more deeply." The vast number of grassroots cadres, after learning from good people and good deeds, may be able to elevate and systematize their fragmented things, thereby mastering the laws, applying experience, and doing their work better. After learning from Yang Hongdian's experience, many communes, management districts, and production team cadres in Hunan affirmed some of their own good experiences in listening to the opinions of the masses and going deep into the work groups. If this can be done regularly, these good people and good deeds will be like a magnet, constantly extracting large amounts of iron filings from the sand, making the experience of comrades engaged in grassroots work more substantial and richer.

    学习好人好事
    易槐
    在广大基层干部中，有着许多像湖南浏阳大瑶公社沙螺大队的杨宏典那样的好同志。他们全心全意为群众服务，工作深入，虚心倾听群众意见，艰苦朴素，任劳任怨。广大农村的基层工作同志，要像湖南的同志学习杨宏典一样，把这样的好人好事，做为自己学习的榜样和教材。学习他们的好品质、好作风和好方法。党的领导机关也要像湖南省委那样，好中挑好，精中求精，从许许多多好人好事中，选出最好的作为大家学习的典范和标兵。这样，就能够使大家在思想作风和工作方法上，取法乎上，力争上游。
    在检阅的队伍里，有了标兵，千千万万人在前进中就有了看齐的目标。在基层干部中间，有了好人好事给大家作典范，也就有了争取上进的榜样。一经学习，就可以让广大农村基层干部懂得，怎样才能把事情办好，怎样就可能把事情办坏。在广大基层工作同志中，有许多人辛辛苦苦，一心想给群众多办好事，可是有时候却事与愿违，费了力气，办坏了事情，群众埋怨，自己苦恼。这大多是因为这些同志没有经验，缺少办法，加上思想上的主观片面，工作方法的简单。所以，在任务紧急繁重、情况比较复杂的时候，常常分不清是非，划不清界限，弄不清事物间彼此的关系和联系，因而办错了事。对于这些同志，如果只是责备他们这样做不好，那样做不对，那末，他们就会束手束脚，不敢大胆负责，工作也就有可能受到损失。对于这些同志，要他们学习好人好事，就是提高认识、改进工作的最好办法之一。
    党的群众路线，在基层干部脑子里，如果只是几条原则条文，对它的理解不深和不会具体运用，那就不可能真正走群众路线。学习那些善于走群众路线的好人好事，就有可能把群众路线变成有血有肉、生动活泼的东西。湖南湘阴范家园公社党委第一书记张瑞林谈到，他们在工作中常常把加强领导和群众路线对立起来。学习了杨宏典的事迹以后，才弄清楚了要加强领导必须走好群众路线，没有集中领导的群众路线只是尾巴主义，而不是真正的群众路线。
    在广大基层干部中，做错事情的，当然只是极少数的。如果他们学习了好人好事，那末，他们就有可能从好人好事中照出自己的缺点和犯错误的原因，从而容易克服缺点，改正错误。同时，广大基层干部，学习了好人好事，他们就有可能从好人好事中启发自己的思考，从而明确经验教训，进一步推进工作，搞好生产。毛泽东同志在“实践论”中指明：“感觉到了的东西，我们不能立刻理解它，只有理解了的东西才更深刻地感觉它。”广大基层干部，经过学习好人好事，就有可能把自己的那些零碎片断的东西提高和系统化，从而掌握规律，运用经验，把工作做得更好。湖南好多公社、管理区和生产队的干部学习了杨宏典的经验以后，就肯定了自己倾听群众意见、深入作业组等方面的一些好经验。如果能够经常这样做，这些好人好事就会像磁石一样，不断地从沙土中吸出大量的铁砂，使从事基层工作的同志的经验，更加充实，更加丰富。
