Nanchang City Cadres
    Study Political Economy

    (From Our Own Correspondent) In order to better implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to launch a study of the "Textbook of Political Economy (Third Edition)" among all in-service cadres in the city starting in mid-June. While requiring Party organizations at all levels to establish central study groups in their respective units, with members of the Party committee as the core, the Municipal Committee, in order to strengthen the leadership of theoretical study for leading cadres of municipal-level organs and to promote and encourage the theoretical study of the broad masses of cadres throughout the city, decided to expand the original Municipal Committee Central Study Group, which had been centered on the Standing Committee members of the Municipal Committee, from nineteen to sixty-two people. Deputy ministers of the Municipal Committee departments, chairmen and secretaries of the trade unions, the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation, directors and bureau chiefs of the Municipal People's Committee departments all participate in the Municipal Committee Central Study Group.

    The Municipal Committee also decided that Comrade Guo Guangzhou, Alternate Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and First Secretary of the Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, would personally take charge of the Municipal Committee Central Study Group, serving as the first group leader, and the secretaries and deputy secretaries of the Municipal Committee Secretariat would serve as group leaders and deputy group leaders. In order to enable the comrades participating in the Municipal Committee Central Study Group to sit down and seriously read some books, it was also decided that the "Study Day" time every Wednesday afternoon would be used for concentrated study in four groups.

    Regarding the content and method of study, given that the members participating in the Municipal Committee Central Study Group had previously studied the capitalist part of political economy, the requirements for studying the upper volume of the "Textbook of Political Economy (Third Edition)" are mainly to review the main points of the key chapters of the upper volume, in order to lay the foundation for studying the socialist part of political economy. It also emphasized reading carefully, studying documents independently, reading textbooks and related classic works, supplemented by necessary discussions and guidance.

    The four groups of the Municipal Committee Central Study Group conducted special discussions on how to carry out this study effectively and established the necessary systems. In addition, each group was also equipped with a study secretary. (Chen Wenfa)

    南昌市在职干部
    学习政治经济学
    本报讯　中共南昌市委为了更好地贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，决定自6月中旬起在全市在职干部中开展“政治经济学教科书（第三版）”的学习。在要求各级党组织以党委成员为核心成立各单位的中心学习组的同时，市委为了加强对市级机关主要领导干部理论学习的领导，并对全市广大干部的理论学习起推动鼓舞作用，决定将原来以市委常委为核心的市委中心学习组由十九人扩大到六十二人；市委各部的副部长，工会、青年团和妇联主席、书记，主任和市人委各局的局长都参加市委中心组的学习。
    市委并决定市委中心学习组由中共江西省委候补书记、中共南昌市委第一书记郭光洲同志亲自挂帅，担任中心组第一组长，市委书记处的书记和副书记担任组长和副组长。为了使参加市委中心学习组的同志们能坐下来认真地读些书，同时确定每周星期三下午的“学习日”时间分四个小组集中学习。
    在学习内容和学习方法方面，鉴于参加市委中心学习组的成员过去已经学过政治经济学资本主义部分，因此学习
  “政治经济学教科书（第三版）”上册的要求，主要是复习上册重点章节的主要论点，为学习政治经济学社会主义部分打下基础。并强调认真读书，自学文件，阅读教科书和有关经典著作，辅以必要的讨论和辅导。
    市委中心组的四个小组，对如何搞好这次学习都进行了专门座谈，订立了必要的制度。此外，各小组还配备了学习秘书。（陈文发）
