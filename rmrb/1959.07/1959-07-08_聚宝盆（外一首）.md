    Treasure Bowl (and another poem)
    Ji Peng

    Trees shade the military camp, flowers reflect on the gate,
    Two banyan trees grow green into shade,
    Yellow bamboo is inserted in a circle under the trees,
    With red characters written "Treasure Bowl".
    Treasure bowl, how pleasing,
    Although the treasure bowl is small, it gathers gold and silver:
    Rusty copper and rotten iron become machines,
    Rags and rotten cotton are woven into brocade,
    Broken glass, blooms new flowers,
    Waste paper becomes a learning notebook...
    Thrown in the fields it becomes fertilizer,
    Collected in the basin, pearls roll in.
    The bowl is full of gold, the bowl is full of silver,
    Soldiers are not alchemists,
    Waste products are sent to the recycling station,
    To be reproduced and benefit the people.

    Rushing to Harvest
    News came at dawn,
    A storm is coming,
    The wheat in the field is ripe,
    Help the people rush to harvest.
    The wheat field is like a battlefield,
    Reaping wheat is like killing enemies,
    Waving sickles dances like silver snakes,
    Threshing wheat rains down like golden rain.
    In less than half a day,
    The wheat has been rushed to harvest,
    The fruit of hard work and sweat,
    Happily stored in the granary.
    As noon approaches,
    Dark clouds fill the sky,
    Lightning splits the sky,
    Thunder, rain and storm arise.
    Rain pours like the Yangtze River,
    Wind breaks the branches of large trees,
    Soldiers and civilians lean by the window,
    Casually talking about the harvest.

    聚宝盆（外一首）
    纪鹏树掩军营花映门，两棵榕树绿成荫，树下黄竹插成圈，上写红字“聚宝盆”。聚宝盆，喜煞人，宝盆虽小聚金银：锈铜烂铁变机器，破布、烂棉织成锦，碎玻璃，开新花，废纸变成学习本……丢在四野化粪土，集在盆内珠滚滚。金满盆，银满盆，战士不是点金人，废品送往收购站，再生造福为人民。
    抢收凌晨传消息，将来暴风雨，田间麦已熟，助民抢收去。麦田摆战场，割麦如杀敌，挥镰舞银蛇，打麦落金雨。不消半日间，麦已抢收毕，血汗辛勤果，喜收粮仓里。天将近中午，乌云漫天际，闪电裂长空，雷雨暴风起。雨如长江倒，风折大树枝，军民倚窗前，闲话丰收事。
