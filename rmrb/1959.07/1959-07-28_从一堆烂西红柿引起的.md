    Caused by a Pile of Rotten Tomatoes
    Xing Wen
    In Beijing, a woman bought a pile of rotten tomatoes for three cents. She used some for cooking, and the children ate the rest raw. The next day, all five children contracted dysentery, vomiting and diarrhea. Two of them were in serious condition and were immediately hospitalized, while the others were treated at home.
    Afterward, the woman said in the Beijing Daily: "This incident taught me a great lesson." The lesson she learned was: Because she did not pay serious attention to summer hygiene, first, the children suffered; second, the state spent money: "Our family's economic situation is not very good. The government took care of us and waived the children's hospitalization, medicine, and food expenses. The cost for just the fourth child alone was 168 yuan!" Third, others were burdened. Six or seven doctors treated them, and Manager Li of the retail store even went to her home to apologize. She said, "I really caused a lot of trouble for everyone." (Beijing Daily, July 13).
    This is indeed a great lesson. Who would dare to underestimate these "Four Musts and Three Must Nots"? However, the lessons are not limited to these. More importantly, it tells us that whatever we do, we must always think about the connection between the individual and everyone else. This connection is inherently universal, but in daily life, especially in trivial matters, it is often overlooked. It is only after "suffering" or "causing a lot of trouble for everyone" that people begin to regret it.
    The woman bought rotten tomatoes originally just to "save money." How could she have imagined that the children would suffer because of this, that the individual would have to spend money, that the country would suffer losses, and that others would be burdened?
    The retail store sold rotten tomatoes, presumably just to reduce a little loss and increase a little income for the country. How could they have imagined that the state would instead have to pay more money? Compared to three cents and 168 yuan, how should this be calculated?
    From the perspective of thrift and frugality, neither intention can be said to be bad. However, because they ignored the connection between rotten tomatoes and dysentery, and through dysentery, the connection to human health, national wealth, doctors' labor, and so on, the results can only be said to be very bad.
    Through a pile of rotten tomatoes, we especially see that in our country, the connection between people is unprecedentedly close. The person who bought the rotten tomatoes, even though they did not realize it beforehand, that eating rotten tomatoes has anything to do with others, they will realize afterward that their connection with others is so great: How much of society's manpower, material resources, and financial resources were consumed because of this? In our country, anyone who suffers a disaster will receive assistance from the state and the collective. Precisely because of this, everyone also bears a corresponding obligation to everyone else. This is: Whatever we do, even if it is eating a bite of rotten tomatoes, spitting, or letting go of a fly or mosquito, we must always think about what impact it will have on the collective.
    If people can more deeply understand this connection between each other and think about it at all times, the principle of collectivism can be better integrated into our lives. If so, the saying "I suffer the consequences myself, what does it have to do with you?" will probably gradually disappear from our consciousness and our mouths.

    从一堆烂西红柿引起的
    星文
    北京有一位妇女用三分钱买了一堆烂西红柿，烧菜用了一些，留下几个，孩子们把它生吃了。第二天，五个孩子都害了痢疾，又吐，又泻。两个严重的，立即住了医院，其余的留在家里治疗。
    事后，这位妇女在北京日报上说道：“这件事给我很大教训”。她所得的教训就是：由于他一个人没有认真注意夏季卫生，第一，使孩子们吃了苦；第二，使国家花了钱：“我们家经济情况不大好，政府照顾我们，把孩子住院费、药费、饭费都免了，光老四一人，就花了政府一百六十八块钱呢！”第三，让别人跟着受累，六七个大夫给看病，零售店的李经理还到他家去道歉。她说，“真是给大伙找了不少麻烦”。（北京日报7月13日）。
    这的确是很大的教训，有谁还敢轻视这“四要三不要”吗？但是，教训却又不只这些，更重要的是，它告诉我们，不论作什么，都要常常想到个人同大家之间的联系。这种联系本来是普遍存在着的，但是在日常，特别是在生活小事上，往往被人所忽略。只是当“吃了苦头”或者是“给大伙找了不少麻烦”之后，这才来追悔。
    这位妇女买烂西红柿，原来只是“图贱”；她那里曾经想到孩子们会因此吃苦，个人会因此破费，国家要因此受损，别人要因此受累呢？
    零售店出售烂西红柿，原先怕只是为了减少一点损耗、为国家增加一点收入，他们那里又曾想到，国家反而因此要支付更多的资财。三分钱同一百六十八元相比，这笔账该怎样算法呢？
    从勤俭过日子的角度看，两者的打算都不能说坏，但是，由于忽略了烂西红柿同痢疾、又通过痢疾同人体健康、国家资财、医生劳苦等等一系列事物的联系，结果都不能不说很糟。
    透过一堆烂西红柿，特别使我们看到，在我们国家里，人同人之间的联系，是空前地紧密了。买烂西红柿的人，尽管事前没有认识到，我吃烂西红柿，同别人有什么相干，但事后他总会认识到，他同别人的牵连却是那样的大：社会的人力、物力、财力为此消耗了多少？在我们国家里，任何人有了灾难，都会得到国家和集体的救援，正因为这样，每个人又对大家负有一种相应的义务，这就是：无论作什么，那怕是吃一口烂西红柿，吐一口痰，放走一个苍蝇、蚊子，时刻都要想到它对集体将带来什么影响。
    如果人们能够更深切地理解彼此间的这种联系，时时想到它，便能使集体主义原则，更好地渗透到我们的生活中去。如果这样，“我自作自受，碍着你什么事”的话大概就会从我们的意识里和嘴里逐渐消失了。
