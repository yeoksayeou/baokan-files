Rescue Glyzos!
Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

The Greek authorities, disregarding the great indignation of all of Greece and the entire world, have actually handed over the world-renowned Greek national hero and peace fighter Glyzos to a military court for trial, preparing to persecute him with trumped-up charges. The news is infuriating. We must lodge a strong protest with the Greek authorities: No persecution of Glyzos! We must appeal to the whole world: Let all righteous people take immediate action to rescue Glyzos!

Glyzos, this is a name respected by the Greek people, and it is also a name respected by peace-loving people all over the world. Glyzos is not guilty; he has loyalty to the Greek people, love for the motherland, a fearless spirit of resistance to imperialist aggressors, and indelible contributions to the cause of peace! Glyzos has always stood with the Greek people, and the Greek people have always loved Glyzos. Eighteen years ago, when Glyzos climbed the Acropolis in Athens and tore down the fascist flag, creating a heroic miracle, Hitler himself personally announced a death sentence in absentia, but the Greek people hid him and prevented him from being killed by the fascists. After the war, Glyzos continued to struggle for the independence and freedom of his motherland. When he was imprisoned by the Greek reactionary authorities in 1951 and 1952, the Greek people still elected him as a member of parliament twice. In Greece, Glyzos has become a symbol of freedom, justice, and patriotism. No matter how hard the Greek authorities try, they cannot find any reason to persecute this national hero. They disregard everything and hand Glyzos over to a military court for trial, actually only placing themselves in a position condemned by everyone.

People cannot help but think of such a question: In Greece, which has long been freed from fascist occupation, why do the Greek authorities persecute national heroes like Glyzos time and again? Obviously, the Greek authorities want to further follow the war policy of the United States and sell out national interests, so they are trying every means to suppress the patriotic and democratic forces in Greece. The illegal trial of Glyzos happened to coincide with the Greek authorities' preparation to agree to the United States establishing missile bases in Greece, which is absolutely not accidental. Therefore, we should see that the persecution of Glyzos and other patriots is an attack on the Greek people and the cause of peace.

Now, Glyzos's fate is at a dangerous juncture. All the people of Greece and the world are concerned about him and support him. In order to rescue Glyzos and other patriots, in order to safeguard human justice and dignity, all righteous and peace-loving people should take further action, try every means to stop the Greek authorities from persecuting Greek patriots, and demand that the Greek authorities immediately cancel the trial of Glyzos and immediately restore Glyzos's freedom!

    援救格列索斯！
    中国科学院副院长　李四光
    希腊当局甘冒全希腊和全世界之大不韪，竟把举世闻名的希腊民族英雄和和平战士格列索斯交给军事法庭审讯，准备用莫须有的罪名来迫害他。消息传来，令人义愤填膺。我们要向希腊当局提出强烈的抗议：不准迫害格列索斯！我们要向全世界发出呼吁：让一切正直的人们立即行动起来，援救格列索斯！
    格列索斯，这是希腊人民所尊敬的名字，这也是全世界爱好和平人民所尊敬的名字。格列索斯没有罪；他有的是对于希腊人民的忠诚，是对于祖国的热爱，是对于帝国主义侵略者的大无畏的反抗精神，是对于和平事业的不可磨灭的功绩！格列索斯始终和希腊人民站在一起，希腊人民也始终爱护格列索斯。十八年前，当格列索斯爬上雅典的城堡，撕下法西斯旗帜，创造了英雄的奇迹以后，希特勒曾亲自宣布缺席判决他的死刑，可是希腊人民把他隐藏起来，没有让他受到法西斯的杀害。战后，格列索斯为了祖国的独立自由继续进行斗争。当1951年和1952年他被希腊反动当局关在监狱里的时候，希腊人民仍然两次把他选为国会议员。在希腊，格列索斯已经成为自由、正义和爱国主义的象征。希腊当局不论怎样挖空心思，也不可能找到任何理由来迫害这位民族英雄。他们不顾一切地把格列索斯交军事法庭审讯，实际上只是把他们自己置于千夫所指的地位而已。
    人们不能不想到这样一个问题：在希腊早已摆脱了法西斯占领的今天，希腊当局究竟为什么要一次再次地迫害像格列索斯这样的民族英雄呢？显然，希腊当局是为了进一步追随美国的战争政策，出卖民族利益，才想尽办法来镇压希腊的爱国民主力量。对格列索斯的非法审讯，恰恰发生在希腊当局准备同意美国在希腊建立火箭基地的同时，这绝对不是偶然的。因此，我们应该看到，对格列索斯和其他爱国者的迫害，也就是对希腊人民和和平事业的进攻。
    现在，格列索斯的命运已经处于危险的关头。全希腊和全世界人民都在关怀着他，支持着他。为了援救格列索斯和其他爱国者，为了维护人类的正义和尊严，一切正直的和爱好和平的人们应该进一步行动起来，想尽一切办法，制止希腊当局对希腊爱国者的迫害，并要求希腊当局立即取消对格列索斯的审讯，立即恢复格列索斯的自由！
