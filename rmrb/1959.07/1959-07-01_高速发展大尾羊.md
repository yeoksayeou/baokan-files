Xinhua News Agency Report: The Hongqi (Red Flag) People's Commune in the Tajik Autonomous County of Taxkorgan, Xinjiang, is rapidly developing the famous Pamir Plateau Dangbash big-tailed sheep.

Last autumn, the commune used 414 Dangbash big-tailed sheep to crossbreed and improve local ewes. This spring, all of them have given birth to lambs. These lambs, at just over ten days old, already weigh five to eight *jin* more than other local lambs of the same breed that were born ten days earlier. To breed another litter before the autumn mating season for sheep this year, the entire commune has already crossbred 986 ewes with Dangbash big-tailed sheep in the spring, and they have conceived.

The Dangbash big-tailed sheep is a famous mutton sheep on the Pamir Plateau, also known as "Gehong" sheep by the local Tajik herders. This type of sheep is particularly fat and large, with fragrant meat and fat. The largest sheep weigh over 120 kilograms, which is twice as much as the meat and wool production of other local sheep breeds. This type of sheep also has the advantages of being cold-resistant and easy to raise; it can be raised extensively in the cold and rugged mountains at temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius under less than ideal conditions.

Spring on the Pamir Plateau is a snowy season. This year, it continued to snow heavily until mid-May, and the pastures were knee-deep in snow, which created difficulties for the spring sheep mating work. However, the enthusiasm of the members of the Hongqi People's Commune for improving sheep breeds is very high. In the spring, the weather is cold and there is little grass, and sheep go into heat slowly, so the Tajik herders have adopted various methods to induce heat, searching for mountain slopes with thin snow and thick grass for grazing, and universally adding feed and fodder. For the five Dangbash big-tailed rams, they also specially added eggs and malt two months before mating. Therefore, the conception rate is very high, breaking the superstition that sheep cannot be mated in the spring on the Pamir Plateau.

    高速发展大尾羊
    据新华社讯　新疆塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县红旗人民公社正在高速度地发展帕米尔高原上有名的当巴什大尾羊。
    这个公社去年秋天曾用当巴什大尾羊杂交改良土种母羊四百一十四只，今年春天已经全部产羔。这种羊羔出生十多天，体重竟比早生十天的其他土种羊羔还重五市斤到八市斤。为了在今年秋季绵羊配种前再多配一胎，全社春季又已经有九百八十六只绵羊与当巴什大尾羊杂交受胎。
    当巴什大尾羊是帕米尔高原上有名的肉用绵羊，当地塔吉克牧民也把它叫做“格薨”羊。这种绵羊体膘特别肥大，肉脂芳香。最大的羊体重达一百二十多公斤，比当地其他土种绵羊的产肉量和产毛量高出一倍。这种羊还具备有耐寒冷，耐粗放的优点，它可以在零下三十多度的气温下条件不很好的崇山峻岭中粗放饲养。
    帕米尔高原的春天是多雪的季节，今年直到5月中旬依然大雪纷飞，牧场积雪盈膝，给春季绵羊配种工作带来了困难。但是红旗人民公社社员改良绵羊品种的积极性很高。春天天寒草少，绵羊发情缓慢，塔吉克牧人就采取多种办法催情，寻找雪薄草厚的山坡牧放，普遍加喂饲料饲草，对于五只当巴什大尾种公羊，还特别在配种前两月就加喂鸡蛋和麦芽。因此配种怀胎率很高，打破了帕米尔高原春季绵羊不能配种的迷信。
