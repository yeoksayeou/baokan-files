    Distant Greetings to the People Who Conquered the Flood
    Xiao Xiangrong
    Heaven has no eyes, yet sheds so many tears,
    Torrents raging, waves rising high;
    Three hundred feet of monstrous waves unleashed,
    Demons howl, tigers roar, a chaotic dance.

    A million strong, fighting on the fields,
    Braving rain for ten days, day and night;
    The demon rises one foot, but the Dao rises ten,
    No fish or dragon allowed to invade the fields.

    Looking south to the distant horizon, the road stretches far,
    Every day, I carefully read the news;
    When I see the flood peak return to the sea,
    My heart feels relieved and broad.

    Good news frequently arrives in my ears,
    Army and people, united, conquer nature;
    I raise my brow, looking four thousand miles south,
    Sending my humble poem from afar, expressing my concern.

    遥寄战胜洪水的人们
    萧向荣
    天公无眼泪偏多，涕泗纵横作浪波；
    掀起恶涛三百丈，狼嗥虎啸舞群魔。
    百万雄师战陌阡，冒淋十日夜连天；
    魔高一尺道高丈，不许鱼龙向亩田。
    云天南望路漫漫，每日新闻细细看；
    一见洪峰归大海，心头如释觉怀宽。
    捷讯频传到耳边，军民群力胜苍天；
    举眉南望四千里，遥寄俚诗赋我悬。
