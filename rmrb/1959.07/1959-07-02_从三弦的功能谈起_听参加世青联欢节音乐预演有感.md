    Starting from the Function of the Sanxian
    ——Thoughts After Listening to the Musical Preview for the World Youth Festival
  　Li Ling
    In recent years, Chinese folk music performers have creatively improved and developed the playing methods of several national musical instruments, giving new life to some ancient instruments. Following Zhao Yuzhai's expansion of the playing methods of the guzheng, I recently heard students from the Northeast Conservatory of Music opening up a new realm in the expression of the yangqin. The bold exploration and research of many young performers showcase a promising future for the development of national musical instruments.
    The other day, I listened to Li Yi's solo performance on the large sanxian, which will be part of the Seventh World Youth Festival, and it sparked some new thoughts in me.
    The large sanxian has always been considered to have a monotonous tone, and the fingerboard is very long, making accurate fingering difficult. Some people who are not accustomed to playing long strings (besides the difficulty of fingering, it is also tiring for the hand) bind a bridge in the middle of the fingerboard to play the lower section. The small sanxian is still commonly used in Cantonese, Southern Jiangsu, and Chaozhou folk orchestras, while the large sanxian is mostly used as accompaniment in storytelling performances, and is rarely seen as a solo instrument.
    When I saw that the program included a large sanxian solo, and that it would be used to perform pieces like "Spring River Flower Moon Night" and "Eighteen Beats," which have deep artistic conceptions and complex variations, I initially found it hard to imagine.
    Li Yi's technique is very good; except for a very few instances where the rapid retreat from a high position to a low note was not quite accurate, it can be said to be quite accomplished. His performance of "Spring River Flower Moon Night" has a certain depth in the depiction of the scenes in the music; he creatively applies various plucking methods to express different sections of the music, with delicate handling of the inflections and pauses. In "Eighteen Beats," in addition to expressing the spirit and interest of the piece in a rather broad and uninhibited manner, there are also many creative uses of playing techniques. Some two-note or three-note simultaneous plucking methods draw partly from the experience of the pipa, so that listening to his solo performance is like listening to a band performance; the volume is not small, and there are many variations. Here, we can also see that the performer has put a lot of effort into this instrument.
    In Chinese folk music, many instruments inherently possess rich functions, such as the erhu, pipa, flute, and xiao, and they have been used earlier to express emotions, depict scenery, and perform various types of music on their own. However, due to the neglect of past rulers, performers mostly followed conventions and were simple in their approach, and these instruments did not achieve rapid development. It was not until the appearance of Liu Tianhua, Lü Wencheng, and others that they boldly broke through the original methods of using the erhu, absorbed some beneficial experiences from China and abroad, and added their own exploration, which greatly improved the performance techniques of the erhu (including other bowed stringed instruments), and created many new erhu pieces, which further enriched this new art.
    After many years, there was almost some stagnation again. It was not until after liberation that the bold attempts of the Northeast Conservatory of Music to infuse new blood into the playing methods of the guzheng, yangqin, etc., aroused widespread attention, which is very natural.
    Li Yi's use of the large sanxian, although not as outstanding as the above in terms of the creativity of playing methods, has also put a lot of effort into its expression.
    The reform of national musical instruments is certainly very important; in recent years, under the advocacy of the Chinese Musicians Association and the Institute of National Music, no less than a hundred instruments have been reformed, making their intonation more accurate, and their scales and ranges more scientific and broader, and some are also more convenient to play. But there must always be some people who explore and research with unremitting perseverance.
    The large sanxian, for example, has not undergone reform. Because of the continuous polishing of young people like Li Yi, they will bring the expressive power of many things that ordinary people consider simple to a considerable height. It is common to see some music workers, such as some suona players in operas, who always make do with simple instruments and follow conventions, often not paying attention to some notes that sound particularly inaccurate. I think that this kind of playing style will be of no avail even if the instrument is reformed well.
    On the contrary, like this large sanxian solo, the instrument remains the same, but much effort has been put into the playing techniques, and many pursuits have been made in the performance of emotions, which will give a new power to an originally relatively simple instrument.

    从三弦的功能谈起
    ——听参加世青联欢节音乐预演有感
  　李凌
    近几年来，我国民乐演奏家创造性地提高和发展了好几种民族乐器的演奏方法，使一些古老的乐器，获得了新的生命。继赵玉斋对古筝的弹奏方法的扩展，前些时又听到东北音乐专科学校的同学，在洋琴的表现上打开了一个新的局面。众多的青年演奏家的大胆探索，钻研，对民族乐器的发展前途，展示了一个远大的前景。
    前天，听了参加第七届世界青年联欢节的李乙的大三弦独奏，触起我一些新的感想。
    大三弦这个乐器，一向被人认为音色单调，而且把位很长，要走指准确，实不容易。有些人不习惯弹长弦（除走指困难以外，手也很累），就在指板中间绑上一个音码，取其下段来弹奏。小三弦在广东、苏南、潮州民族乐队中还常应用，大三弦只在曲艺表演中作为伴奏使用较多，而作为独奏乐器则较少见。
    当我看到节目单中有大三弦独奏，而且是用它来演奏像“春江花月夜”，“十八板”这些意境较深，变化复杂的乐曲，最初有些难以想像。
    李乙的技巧是很好的，除了极少数从较高音位迅速地退回到低音有点不够准确之外，可说是相当到家。他表演的“春江花月夜”，对曲中情景的刻划，有一定的深度；他创造性地应用各种弹法，来表现乐曲中不同的段落，抑扬顿挫，处理得非常细致。在“十八板”中，除了相当宽广、犷野地表现出这首乐曲的气色与情趣之外，弹奏手法的创用也不少，有些二音或三同奏的弹法，部分吸取琵琶的经验，因而听他一个人独奏，就好像听一组乐队表演一样；音量不小，变化也多，这里也可以看到，演奏者对这个乐器所花费的心血是不少的。
    我国民乐中，有许多乐器，本来就具有丰富的功能，像二胡、琵琶、笛箫等，也较早就应用它们单独来抒情写景，表演各种音乐。但是，由于过去统治者的漠视，演奏者也多是因循就简，没有获得迅速的发展。直到刘天华、吕文成等人出现，才大胆地冲破了二胡原来的使用方法，吸取一些中外的有益经验，加上自己的摸索，使二胡的
  （包括其他弓弦乐器）表现技巧，大大地提高一步，并且创作了不少新的二胡曲，这些新的艺术才更丰富起来。
    中间经过许多年，差不多又有些停顿了。直到解放以后，东北音专方面的大胆尝试，对古筝、洋琴等的演奏方法赋予新的血液，引起了各方面的重视，这是很自然的。
    李乙对大三弦的使用，在弹奏方法的创造性上虽然没有上述的那么突出，但在表现上也下了不少工夫。
    民族乐器的改革，固然十分重要；这几年来经过音协、民族音乐研究所的提倡，改革了不下百多件，音准更加精确，音阶音域更科学、更宽广，有些演奏起来也更便利了。但总要有一些百折不回的探索、钻研的人才行。
    像大三弦，是没有经过改革的，因为有了像李乙这些年青人在夜以继日的琢磨，就会把许多常人认为简陋的东西的表现力，提到相当高度。常见有些音乐工作者，如某些戏曲中的唢呐演奏者，总是因陋就简，因循应付，经常有些音显得特别不准确，也不以为意。像这种演奏作风，我想，即使乐器改革好了，也是无济于事的。
    相反，像这次的大三弦独奏，乐器依旧，而在演奏技巧上花了许多心血，在表演情感上作了许多追求，就会把一个原来比较简单的乐器，赋以新的力量。
