    Adjusting Surpluses and Deficits to Stimulate the Market and Support Construction
    The Warehouse Cleaning of Pingluo Commune is Well Done
    A batch of stockpiled electrical equipment, automobile tires, and drilling machines were quickly transferred out to supply other areas in need.
    (Our newspaper's Zhengzhou dispatch on July 25th) The supply and marketing department of the Pingluo People's Commune in Mengjin County, Henan Province, starting from the end of May, conducted a comprehensive inventory of the warehouses of its affiliated village and town consignment points and commodity sales outlets. This quickly found outlets for a large number of stockpiled commodities that were also needed in the local market, ensuring supply. Commodities unsuitable for local sales were also immediately transferred out to supply the needs of other markets.
    According to the results of this inventory, the total value of commodity stocks in the entire commune reached more than 1.23 million yuan. Among them, reasonable stocks of marketable commodities accounted for about 80%, commodities with excessive stocks accounted for 5.82%, commodities unsuitable for rural sales accounted for more than 10% of the stock, and the remaining seasonal and mildewed/damaged commodities accounted for more than 4%. After the inventory, internal adjustments and exchanges of goods reached as many as 150 kinds, with a total value of more than 63,400 yuan. Active external transfers to support cities and industrial and mining areas involved 15 kinds of commodities, with a total value of more than 120,000 yuan. Due to the rapid clearing of the warehouse, the bottom line of commodity inventory was clarified, ensuring that commodities were suitable, which not only guaranteed market supply but also greatly compressed inventory, accelerated capital turnover, and increased turnover. The commodity inventory of each outlet in the commune in June was compressed by more than 10% compared with May, the capital turnover was shortened from 90 days to 75 days, and the retail sales of each outlet also increased by 10% to 20% compared with May.
    The Pingluo People's Commune Supply and Marketing Department has 40 business departments, including 28 relatively large outlets. During the large-scale purchases and sales last year, some commercial personnel grabbed goods when they saw them, blindly purchasing, thinking that having goods would ensure sales. Some people had the idea of "reluctance to sell" and "localism" for fast-selling goods and were unwilling to let go of the supply. As a result, some commodities were stockpiled, but the market was out of stock. For example, umbrellas, rubber shoes, batteries, and alarm clocks, which the masses urgently needed in the past, had a large inventory in the warehouse, but could not be bought in the outlet. The 140,000 catties of local alkali stored in the warehouse were not distributed to the outlets. Due to blind purchases, commodities unsuitable for rural sales were worth more than 120,000 yuan, such as expensive tungsten wire for making light bulbs, a large amount of electrical equipment, tires for heavy-duty vehicles and motorcycles, welding flux for electric welding, drilling machines, etc., were all stockpiled in the warehouse.
    At the beginning of the inventory, some commercial personnel were unwilling to clear the warehouse, fearing that the cleared commodities would be transferred to other places, and the business plan would not be completed, fearing that the inventory of stockpiled materials would be criticized. In response to these ideas, the commune's Party committee and the supply and marketing department decided to carry out an education on the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" among all commercial personnel, and conducted a discussion on the issues of "Is it good or bad to have warehouse stockpiles and outlet shortages?" "How to ensure market supply and meet the needs of the masses?" "Should we cooperate and support?" etc. In order to strengthen the leadership of the inventory work, each production brigade was led by the party branch secretary to set up an inventory office. During the busy season of summer harvesting and planting, two teams of people were formed, one for supply and one for inventory, taking inventory of the warehouse during the day and the outlet at night, first taking inventory of the consignment point, then the outlet, so that the inventory work could be carried out quickly.
    Each consignment point and outlet implemented the spirit of clearing, standing in line, and handling at the same time during the inventory, so that the materials cleared out were quickly put into the market, ensuring supply and promoting market activity. For example, in the past, some people in the commune could not buy batteries. This time, 3,297 batteries were inventoried and immediately transferred to the outlet for supply, which the masses reacted very well to. The Songzhuang outlet had 18 kinds of electrical materials in its warehouse, and it was unwilling to transfer them out for a long time. Pingluo Town was installing electric lights and needed these materials. This time, all of them were transferred to them, which was very popular. Luoyang Nonferrous Metal Processing Factory needed tungsten wire. This time, all the tungsten wire worth 74,200 yuan was sold to them, which not only reduced unnecessary inventory but also strongly supported industrial production. In the process of handling these stockpiled materials, commercial personnel also actively handled cold and unpopular goods that they thought could not be sold in the past. For example, 30,000 catties of ferrous ammonium sulfate, a raw material for making local chemical fertilizer, were stored in the warehouse and could not be sold for a long time. The masses were not used to using it. After this inventory, the salesmen went to the brigades to publicize and explain the method of use. Yaquan Brigade alone sold more than 13,000 catties at one time. (Attached picture)
    Henan Pingluo Commune's commercial departments quickly supplied the materials cleared from the warehouse to meet market needs, and organized internal material exchange meetings. This is a picture of purchasing and marketing units selecting goods at the exchange meeting, preparing to supply the market in a timely manner.

### 平乐公社仓库清理得好

    调剂有无活跃市场支援建设
    平乐公社仓库清理得好
    一批积压的电工器材、汽车轮胎和钻探机等物资迅速外调供应别地需要
    本报郑州25日电　河南省孟津县平乐人民公社供销部，从5月底开始，对所属村镇代销点和商品购销门市部的仓库，进行了一次全面的清仓盘点，使大批积压而当地市场上又正需要的商品，很快找到了销路，保证了供应；一些不适合当地销售的商品，也立即外调，供应别地市场的需要。
    根据这次清仓结果，全公社商品库存总值达一百二十三万多元，其中合理库存的适销商品占80％左右，库存量过大的商品占5.82％，不适合农村销售的商品占库存量的10％以上，其余过季和霉烂损失的商品占4％以上。经过清仓盘点以后，进行内部调剂，互相交流的商品达一百五十种之多，总值六万三千四百多元；积极外调，支援城市、工矿区的商品有十五种，总值十二万多元。由于迅速清理了仓库，摸清了商品库存的底细，做到商品对路，一方面保证了市场供应，一方面也大大压缩了库存，加速资金周转，营业额也有上升。全社各个门市部6月份商品库存比5月份要压缩10％以上，资金周转从九十天缩短到七十五天，各个门市部零售额也都比5月份上升10％到20％。
    平乐人民公社供销部共有四十个营业部门，其中有二十八个比较大的门市部。当去年大购大销时，部份商业人员见货就抓，盲目进货，认为有货不怕卖不掉，有些人对畅销货则存在“惜售”和“本位主义”思想，不愿放手供应，因而有些商品库存积压，但市场脱销，比如过去群众急需要的雨伞、胶鞋、电池、闹钟，仓库存量很多，门市部却买不到。仓库里存放的十四万斤土石碱，也没有下放到各个门市部。由于盲目进货，不适合农村销售的商品价值达十二万多元，如价值昂贵、制电灯泡用的钨丝，大量的电工器材，载重汽车、摩托车用的轮胎和电焊用的钻焊粒、钻探机等等，仓库都有积压。
    在开始清仓时，部分商业人员还不愿意清仓，怕清出的商品调到外地，营业计划完不成，怕清点出积压物资要受批评。针对这些思想，公社党委和供销部决定在全体商业人员中开展了一次“全国一盘棋”方针的教育，并且以“仓库积压、门市脱销好不好？”“如何保证市场供应，满足群众需要？”“应不应该协作支援？”等等问题进行了鸣放辩论。为了加强清仓工作的领导，各个生产大队都以党的支部书记挂帅，成立清仓办公室。在夏收夏种繁忙季节，组成两套人马，一套搞供应，一套清仓盘点，白天盘仓库，晚上盘门市，先盘代销点，后盘门市部，使清仓盘点工作很快的进行。
    每个代销点和门市部在盘点时都贯彻边清、边站队、边处理的精神，使清点出来的物资，很快投入市场，保证了供应，促进了市场的活跃。比如过去社里有些人买不到电池，这次盘点出三千二百九十七节电池，马上调到门市供应，群众反映非常好。宋庄门市部仓库存有十八种电料器材，长久不愿外调，本地又销售不了；平乐镇正安装电灯，需要这些器材，这次全部调给他们，很受欢迎。洛阳有色金属加工厂需要钨丝，这次把价值七万四千二百元的钨丝全部出售给他们，不仅压缩了不必要的库存，而且有力的支援了工业生产。在处理这些积压的物资中，商业人员还积极主动处理过去认为销售不了的冷背货。如仓库存有三万斤制土化肥的原料硫酸錏铁，长期销售不掉，群众不习惯用，这次盘点出来以后，营业员就分头到各大队进行宣传，讲解使用的方法，仅耀泉一个大队一次就销售一万三千多斤。（附图片）
