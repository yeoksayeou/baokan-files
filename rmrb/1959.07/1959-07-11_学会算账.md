To do things, it's easier to have a clear idea. Those engaged in industrial production and construction, in particular, must have a clear idea. Having a clear idea here doesn't just mean knowing the capacity of the machines you use, how high your skills are, or how much you can produce in a day; it also means knowing how much it costs to produce what you produce, and how much it's worth. Which of these two numbers is bigger? This is what people usually call economic effect.

To know the economic effect of your production, you have to calculate. What kind of calculations? Calculate the consumption of raw materials and materials, the depreciation (consumption) of equipment and tools, wages, and all other expenses for production. Calculate the value of production (calculated according to the prices stipulated by the state). Only when these accounts are clear can you know whether the production is profitable or loss-making financially.

Is the accounting finished here? No. Our purpose in understanding objective things is to transform them. Our purpose in understanding the economic effect of production is to improve production. Where should we start to improve? This requires comparing our own production's various consumption and expenses, the quantity and quality of our products, with quotas, with other workers, with other teams, with other workshops, and with other factories. As the saying goes, "You don't have to be an expert to know good goods, but you have to compare goods." From comparison, we know where the strengths and weaknesses of our production are; from comparison, we know why the economic effect of production is high or low, and we also know where to start improving production. If we calculate, analyze, and compare every day, we can promote our strengths, overcome our weaknesses, and make progress every day. For example, after the Fourth Workshop of the Shenyang Cotton Textile Factory implemented group economic accounting in June, compared with May, the average daily output increased by 3%, the first-class product rate increased by 0.9%, material consumption decreased by 15.6%, and costs decreased by 1.91% in the first half of the month. After the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation's Maritime Transport Bureau implemented economic accounting in the second quarter, the unit cost of loading and unloading decreased by 24.34% compared with the first quarter.

Therefore, accounting can not only give us a clear idea but also promote our efforts to practice thrift, improve labor efficiency, and increase the quantity and quality of our products. Accounting is a weapon to promote the in-depth development of the campaign to increase production and practice thrift. We must learn to calculate. Not only should every factory calculate, but every workshop, every team, and even every worker should calculate. Learning to calculate is not difficult because producers are the most familiar with the production situation. Of course, there is a process for doing everything. In the beginning, the calculations may not be very accurate or very detailed. However, "where there's a will, there's a way." As long as we persevere, we can calculate more and more accurately and more and more meticulously. In the end, we will definitely become experts in economic accounting.

    学会算账
    孔桑
    做事情，心中有数就好办。从事工业生产和建设的人，尤其要心中有数。这里讲的心中有数，不只是要知道自己使用的机器能力多大、自己的技艺多高、一天能够生产多少东西，还要知道自己生产的东西花多少本钱、值多少钱，这两个数字哪一个大，这就是人们通常讲的经济效果。
    要知道自己生产的经济效果，就得算账。算什么账呢？算原料、材料的消耗、设备和工具的折旧（消耗）和工资等一切为了生产而支出的账，算生产价值（按照国家规定的价格算）的账。这些账都算清楚了，才能知道生产在财务上是盈是亏。
      账算到这里是否就完了呢？没有。我们认识客观事物，目的是要改造它。我们了解生产的经济效果，目的是要改进生产。从哪里着手改进呢？这就需要将自己生产的各种消耗和开支、自己的产品数量和质量跟定额比，跟别的工人比，跟别的班组比，跟别的车间比，跟别的工厂比。俗话说，“不怕不识货，只怕货比货。”从比较中，便知道自己的生产中长处在哪里，短处在哪里；从比较中，便知道生产的经济效果为什么高，为什么低，也知道该从哪里着手改进生产。我们天天核算，天天分析比较，便能天天发扬优点，克服缺点，天天进步。例如，沈阳市棉织厂第四车间，六月份实行小组经济核算以后，上半月同五月份比，平均日产量提高百分之三，一等品率提高百分之零点九，材料消耗降低百分之十五点六，成本降低百分之一点九一。山东交通厅海运局第二季度实行经济核算以后，装卸的单位成本比第一季度降低了百分之二十四点三四。
    所以，算账不仅可以使我们心中有数，还可以推动我们厉行节约，推动我们提高劳动效率，推动我们提高产品的数量和质量。算账是推动增产节约运动深入开展的一种武器。我们一定要学会算账。不仅每一个工厂要算账，每一个车间、每一个班组，甚至每一个工人也要算账。学会算账并不困难，因为生产者是最熟悉生产情况的。当然，做什么事情都有一个过程，在开始的时候，可能算得不很准确，不很细致。但是，“有志者事竟成”，只要我们坚持下来，便可以越算越准确，越算越细致，最后，我们一定会成为经济核算的内行。
