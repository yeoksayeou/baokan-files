Anshan and Fushun Improve Stoves, Greatly Saving Domestic Coal

(Liaoning Daily Report) Anshan, Fushun, and other regions are vigorously conserving domestic coal.

The Anshan area has saved over 100,000 tons of domestic coal in the past six months, accounting for more than 83% of the total coal saved last year. Fushun City statistics from mid-April to June 15 show that 100,243 stoves were modified in the city, saving an average of 6,532 tons of coal per month.

The Anshan area's coal conservation is due to the importance attached to this work by Party and government leaders. The city's Party Congress also included coal conservation as an important agenda item. The city and counties frequently conduct in-depth publicity on coal conservation and continuously hold on-site meetings to promote advanced experiences. The measures they have taken are: first, mobilize the masses to modify stoves and reduce coal consumption rates. The Anshan Tiexi Gongtong Commune canteen reduced coal consumption by 50% and increased cooking efficiency by about 100% after changing the original coal- and wood-burning stoves to "natural draft" stoves. This year, residents have vigorously promoted advanced coal-saving stoves such as the "shrunken neck stove," "double-linked stove," "trumpet-shaped," and "three-layer brick ground stove." In heating alone, more than 60,000 tons of coal have been saved. Secondly, in order to process as much pulverized coal and substandard coal as possible to meet the needs of the people's lives and save good coal, the city leaders mobilized the staff of the processing departments to engage in vigorous airing of views and tap potential. The staff created foot-operated briquette machines, mixers, and rolling cutters, increasing work efficiency by two to three times. In the past six months, they have processed more than 8,000 tons of pulverized coal. According to incomplete statistics, residents have also produced more than 10,000 tons of coal briquettes.

The work of improving stoves by Fushun residents was carried out under the organization and leadership of the Coal and Building Materials Management Office of the Fushun Municipal Bureau of Commerce. The coal management departments of each district organized a total of 66 professional coal-saving cadres to go deep into the streets. Under the leadership of the street Party branches and with the assistance of street cadres, they conducted publicity among the residents and helped with stove modification. In the Fourth Residents' Committee of Heping Street, Wanghua District, after cadres demonstrated stove modification and organized visits, all the stoves in the residents' committee were modified in less than five days. During the process of modifying the stoves, the coal management departments of each district, on the basis of doing a good job in ideological work, provided guidance on modification according to the different characteristics of the original stoves of the households, the number of household members, and the size of cooking utensils, and were responsible to the end. At the end of the stove modification, a review was organized to conduct a strict quality inspection again. Therefore, it was generally welcomed by the residents. (Picture attached)

    鞍山抚顺改进炉灶
    大大节省生活用煤
    据辽宁日报消息　鞍山、抚顺等地，大力节约生活用煤。
    鞍山地区半年来节约生活用煤十万余吨，已占去年全年节约用煤量83％以上。抚顺市从4月中旬至6月15日统计，全市居民改灶十万零二千四百三十二个，每月平均节约煤炭六千五百三十二吨。
    鞍山地区节约用煤是由于党、政领导上重视这一工作。市区党代会并曾把节约煤炭作为一项重要议题。市、县经常对节约煤炭进行深入的宣传工作，不断召开现场会议推广先进经验。他们所采取的办法是，首先动员群众改炉改灶，节约煤炭消耗率。鞍山铁西共同公社食堂将原来费煤和木材的炉灶改为“自然风”炉灶后，降低耗煤量50％，提高做饭效率一倍左右。居民今年大力推广了“缩脖灶”、“二连灶”、“喇叭式”、“三层砖地炉”等先进节煤炉灶。仅在取暖方面，就节约煤炭六万多吨。其次为了尽量加工粉煤、次煤满足人民生活需要，并节约好煤，市区领导上发动加工部门职工进行大鸣大放，挖掘潜力。职工创造出脚踏煤球机、搅拌器、滚刀切块器，提高工作效率两倍到三倍，半年来已加工粉煤八千多吨。居民打出的煤坯，据不完全统计也已在万吨以上。
    抚顺居民改进炉灶的工作，是在抚顺市商业局煤建经营处组织领导下进行的。各区采煤经理部共组织了六十六名节煤专业干部深入街道，在街道党支部的领导和街道干部的协助下，在居民中进行宣传并帮助改灶。望花区和平街第四居民委员会三百九十六户居民，经干部动手改灶示范，组织参观后，不到五天时间，全居民委员会的灶都改修完毕。在修改炉灶的过程中，各区煤炭经理部在做好思想工作的基础上，根据住户原有炉灶不同特点和住户人口多少、炊具大小因地制宜指导改修，负责到底。在改灶告一段落时还组织复查工作，再度进行严格的质量检查。因而受到居民的普遍欢迎。（附图片）
