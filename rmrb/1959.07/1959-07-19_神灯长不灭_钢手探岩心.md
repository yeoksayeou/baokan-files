    Everlasting Magic Lamp, Steel Hand Probes the Heart of the Rock
    "Magic Lamp"
    People's legends tell of "magic lamps," said to never go out. Now, there is a kind of lamp that can emit light without using ordinary fuel or electricity, and its lifespan is virtually unlimited. Therefore, calling this lamp a "magic lamp" is perfectly acceptable.
    This "magic lamp" works by using tritium gas to irradiate β-particles, which then cause the luminescent material on the inner wall of the vacuum to glow. It was designed by Hungarian physicist Szegheti. Hungary will produce this lamp on a large scale in the near future.
    Steel "Hand"
    The steel "hand" is a machine used for heavy work, such as digging mine shafts. Because its shape resembles a hand, it is called the steel "hand." It can "grab" half a ton of rock every forty seconds. The steel "hand" is remotely operated and does not require human involvement. It has a rotating pneumatic loading and unloading device, which can also be used for other work when not digging wells.
    White Blood
    Soviet scientists participating in the Antarctic expedition caught a fish whose blood contained no red blood cells but was white. This shattered the notion that blood is always red, revealing that white blood exists! (Yu Wen)

    神灯长不灭　钢手探岩心
    “神灯”
    人们的传说中有过“神灯”的故事，据说这种灯永不熄灭。现在，有一种灯，它可以不用一般燃料及电流来发光，而且使用的期限实际上不受限制。因此，称这种灯为“神灯”也无所不可。
    这种“神灯”是通过本身装置的一种气体氚照射β—质点，引起真空内壁上的发光物质来发亮的。它是匈牙利物理学家舍格提设计的。匈牙利最近的将来就要大批生产这种灯。
    钢“手”
    钢“手”是一种用来作繁重的工作——掘矿井用的机械。因为它形状像手，故称之为钢“手”。它每四十秒钟就可以“抓出”半吨岩石。钢“手”是远距离操纵的，不要人参予工作。它有一种旋转的气力装卸装置，在不用来掘井时，还可用它来作别的工作。
    白色的血
    在南极考察的苏联科学家捕到了一条鱼，这条鱼的血中没有一点红血球而是白色的，这就使人们打破了血都是红色的观念，原来也有白色的血哩！　（宇文）
