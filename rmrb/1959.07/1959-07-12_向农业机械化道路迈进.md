    Sowing the Seeds of Agricultural Mechanization
    The Tongbei State Farm in Heilongjiang Province, established in 1947, was the earliest mechanized farm established after liberation. At that time, when the Liberation War was at its most intense, the Party established it in the Tongbei area of ​​Bei'an County to guide farmers to gradually embark on the road of collectivization and mechanization. In the twelve years since, Tongbei Farm has sown not only soybean and wheat seeds, but also the seeds of agricultural mechanization. At present, there are 85 mechanical farms in the province, and some people's communes have also begun to use agricultural machinery.
      The First Tractor Station
    Heilongjiang Province's first agricultural machinery tractor station—the Huachuan Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station—was established in 1951. Its task was to cultivate land for the surrounding rural areas, especially the Xinghuo Collective Farm. From that year on, farmers who had used curved hoes to cultivate land for generations took the first step towards agricultural mechanization.
  The First Collective Farm to Use Tractors
    The famous Xinghuo Collective Farm—now a management area of the Xinghuo Commune. It is not only the first advanced cooperative in Heilongjiang Province, but also the first farm to use agricultural machinery for cultivation. It was born at the same time as the Huachuan Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station. This farm, which mainly grows rice, uses machinery for plowing, sowing, threshing, milling, and irrigation, in addition to harvesting rice. It once pointed out the direction of collectivization and mechanization for farmers in Heilongjiang Province.
        Female Tractor Driver
    Liang Jun, the first female tractor driver in Heilongjiang Province, now works at the Heilongjiang Provincial Institute of Agricultural Mechanization. She learned to drive a tractor at the Mengya Township Normal School in Dedu County in 1949. Later, the Liang Jun Female Tractor Team was established, which was the beginning of women's participation in agricultural mechanization operations. After this news spread, many young women learned from Liang Jun's example and devoted themselves to land reclamation. Now, every mechanical farm and most people's communes with tractors have female tractor drivers.
    Agricultural Machinery Blossoms in Luobei County
    The Beijing Youth Reclamation Team opened the prelude to the land reclamation cause in Luobei County from the day it opened the first furrow in Luobei County on September 6, 1955. Then, youth land reclamation teams from Tianjin, Hebei and Harbin also came here. Before this, Luobei County, which had been established for more than 60 years, had a population of only 7,000 and more than 8,000 hectares of cultivated land. In 1958, military reclamation farms were established here. Now the population has reached 43,000, the cultivated land has reached 40,000 hectares, and it also has a considerable number of modern agricultural machinery equipment—tractors and trucks. This once sparsely populated county has now become the county with the most agricultural machinery.

    向农业机械化道路迈进
    播下农业机械化的种子
    黑龙江省解放后建立最早的机械化农场，是1947年建立的国营通北农场。当时正是解放战争进行得最紧张的时刻，党为了指引农民逐步走上集体化、机械化的道路，在北安县的通北地区建立的。十二年的时间，通北农场在播下豆麦种子的同时，也播下了农业机械化的种子。目前全省已有机械农场八十五处，部分人民公社也开始使用农业机器了。
      第一个拖拉机站
    黑龙江省的第一个农业机器拖拉机站——桦川农业机器拖拉机站，建立于1951年。它的任务是给周围的农村，特别是星火集体农庄代耕。从那年起，世世代代用弯钩犁种地的农民，迈出了农业机械化的第一步。
  首先使用拖拉机的集体农庄
    著名的星火集体农庄——现在是星火公社的一个管理区。它不仅是黑龙江省的第一个高级合作社，也是首先使用农业机器耕作的农庄。它是和桦川农业机器拖拉机站同时诞生的。这个以种植水稻为主的农庄，除了收稻之外，翻地、播种、脱谷、碾米、灌溉，都是用机械来操作的，它曾给黑龙江省农民指出了集体化、机械化的方向。
        女拖拉机手
    黑龙江省第一个女拖拉机手梁军，她现在在黑龙江省农业机械化研究所里工作。她是在1949年德都县萌芽乡师范学校学习开拖拉机的，后来成立了梁军女拖拉机队，这是妇女参加农业机械化作业的开始。这一消息传出后，很多女青年学习了梁军的榜样，投身在垦荒事业里来。现在，每个机械农场和大部分有拖拉机的人民公社，都有女拖拉机手了。
    农业机械在萝北县开花
    北京青年垦荒队，从1955年9月6日在萝北县开起了第一条犁沟那天起，揭开了萝北县垦荒事业的序幕。接着，天津、河北和哈尔滨的青年垦荒队也来到这里。在这以前，设治六十多年的萝北县，仅有人口七千人，耕地八千多公顷。在1958年这里又建立了军垦农场。现在人口已达四万三千人，耕地也有四万公顷，还拥有数量可观的现代化农业机器装备——拖拉机、载重汽车。这个过去人烟稀少的县份，现在已变成农业机器最多的县份了。
