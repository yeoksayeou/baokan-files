    No Need to Carry Water
    In Yangxu People's Commune, Baise County, Guangxi, fifty-one canteens have now installed "native" running water, so there is no need for people to carry water anymore. The whole commune has saved a total of one hundred and three laborers, who have been投入 invested in the summer harvest and summer planting.
    Yangxu People's Commune is a mountainous area with abundant water sources. However, in the past, each canteen had one to three people specifically assigned to climb mountains and slopes to fetch water. This spring, during the busy season of production and with a shortage of labor, Zhao Dongsheng, the secretary of the commune's Party committee, discovered a large mountain stream flowing through the hillside behind Yangxu Village in Yangxu Brigade. He realized that as long as a trough was built, the water could be diverted. Therefore, he mobilized the masses to find materials and contribute ideas. Cadres and commune members worked together and, after three days of hard work, built the trough and used bamboo pipes to bring the water to the canteens. In this village, the five canteens used to require a total of sixteen people to carry water and cook. After using running water, only nine people are needed for cooking.
    Now, every production team canteen in the entire commune has installed this kind of running water, saving a large number of laborers for summer production. (Li Chaowu)

    吃水不用挑
    广西百色县阳圩公社，现在已有五十一个食堂安装了“土”自来水，吃水再也不用人去挑了。全社共节省出一百零三个劳动力，投入夏收夏种。
    阳圩公社是个山区，水源丰富。但过去各个食堂都专门用一到三个人爬山落坡去挑水吃。今年春天，生产大忙，劳动力紧张，公社党委书记赵东生同志，发现阳圩大队阳圩屯后背的半山腰里，有一股山水流过，水量很大，只要架个槽，就可以把水引过来。于是，他就发动群众找材献料，干部和社员一起动手，苦战三天架好了槽，用竹管把水引到各个食堂里。这个屯的五个食堂，过去共用十六个人挑水做饭，用上自来水以后，只用九个人做饭就行了。
    现在全公社各个生产队的食堂都安上了这种自来水，节省出大批劳力投入夏季生产。　（黎超武）
