In the copper wire workshop of the Shanghai Yuanchang Copper Factory, the floor used to be covered with lubricating oil left over from wire drawing, making it slippery and dangerous, and accidents could easily occur. In May, workers Wu Yuanlu and Xiao Qingquan experimented with using soap powder instead of lubricating oil for wire drawing, and the results were very good, which not only did not affect product quality, but also reduced the cost of copper wire. Recently, Gu Zhenggan further experimented with using soapstock instead of soap powder, and the results were even better. Soapstock does not need to be dissolved and is easy to use, the operation is clean and hygienic, and it can save about 6,800 yuan a year.

    皂脚代油拉铜丝
    上海元昌铜厂的铜丝车间里，过去满地都是拉丝时用剩下来的润滑油，弄得路滑难走，一不小心就会出工伤事故。5月份，工人吴元禄、萧庆全试用肥皂粉代替拉丝的润滑油，效果很好，既不影响产品质量，又可降低铜丝成本。最近，顾正干进一步试用皂脚代替肥皂粉，效果更好，皂脚不需溶化，使用方便，操作时清洁卫生，而且一年能节约费用六千八百元左右。
