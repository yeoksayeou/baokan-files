    Glezos Must Be Released Immediately!
    He Wushuang, Vice President of the International Relations Institute and Director of the Chinese Political Science and Law Society
    "Stop persecuting Glezos! Glezos must be released immediately!" This is the powerful cry of resolute protest from all righteous people around the world against the illegal persecution of Glezos, the Greek national hero and outstanding peace fighter, by the Greek reactionary authorities.
    Manolis Glezos is not only a loyal son of the Greek people and a famous national hero, but also a staunch fighter dedicated to the cause of world peace and human progress. He played an outstanding role in the struggle to defend world peace, resist fascist aggression, and safeguard Greek independence and freedom. However, the Greek reactionary authorities, in violation of the fundamental interests of the Greek people, democratic principles, and the will of peace-loving and freedom-loving people all over the world, tried Glezos and other patriots in a military court in Athens on July 9. This cannot but arouse strong resistance and immense indignation from people all over the world who love peace and justice.
    It should be pointed out that the incident of the Greek reactionary authorities persecuting Glezos is inseparable from the American attempt to further control Greece, establish missile bases in Greece, split the Greek patriotic and democratic forces, and turn Greece into a bridgehead against peace. The Greek people's struggle for democracy, freedom, and happiness, as well as their calls for peace, neutrality, and friendship with socialist countries, are growing day by day. Under these circumstances, in order to clear the obstacles to its implementation of traitorous policies, the Greek reactionary authorities fabricated facts and intensified the persecution of Glezos and other patriots, with the obvious aim of attempting to divert the people's attention from their dissatisfaction with the reactionary government's domestic and foreign policies, and to suppress the Greek patriotic and democratic forces with a policy of terror.
    The Greek people are launching an active struggle to defend Glezos and to defend their democratic rights. At the same time, people from all walks of life around the world are carrying out widespread actions demanding the immediate release of Glezos and other patriots.
    The Chinese people love peace and justice. In the struggle against war and in defense of peace, the Chinese people and the Greek people share the same destiny and breathe the same air. All the Chinese people stand with the heroic Glezos. We express our strong protest against the arbitrary actions of the Greek authorities, who must immediately release Glezos and restore the freedom of Glezos and other patriots!

    必须立即释放格列索斯！
    国际关系学院副院长中国政治法律学会理事  何戊双
    “不准迫害格列索斯！必须立即释放格列索斯！”这是全世界正义人类坚决抗议希腊反动当局非法迫害希腊民族英雄和杰出的和平战士格列索斯的强大呼声。
    曼诺里斯·格列索斯不仅是希腊人民的忠诚儿子和著名的民族英雄，而且是一位致力于世界和平和人类进步事业的坚强战士。他在保卫世界和平、反抗法西斯侵略和维护希腊独立和自由的斗争中起了卓越的作用。但是，希腊反动当局却违背希腊人民的根本利益和民主原则以及全世界爱好和平和自由的人民的意志，7月9日在雅典的军事法庭审讯格列索斯及其他爱国者。这不能不引起全世界爱好和平和正义事业的人民的强烈反抗和无比愤慨。
    应当指出，希腊反动当局迫害格列索斯这一事件，是同美国企图进一步控制希腊，在希腊建立火箭基地，分裂希腊爱国民主力量，变希腊为反对和平的桥头堡这一阴谋分不开的。希腊人民要求民主、自由和幸福的斗争，以及要求和平中立和社会主义国家友好的呼声正日益增长。在这种情况下，希腊反动当局为了扫清它执行卖国政策的障碍，就捏造事实加紧迫害格列索斯及其他爱国者，其目的显然是企图转移人民对反动政府所执行的内外政策不满的注意力，而用恐怖政策镇压希腊爱国民主力量。
    希腊人民为了保卫格列索斯，为了保卫他们的民主权利，正在展开积极的斗争。同时，在世界各地的各阶层的人民正在开展广泛的行动，要求立即释放格列索斯及其他爱国者。
    中国人民热爱和平和正义。在反对战争，保卫和平的斗争中，中国人民和希腊人民是同命运、共呼吸的。全中国的人民都与英勇的格列索斯站在一起。我们对希腊当局的专横行为表示强烈抗议，希腊当局必须立即释放格列索斯，恢复格列索斯及其他爱国者的自由！
