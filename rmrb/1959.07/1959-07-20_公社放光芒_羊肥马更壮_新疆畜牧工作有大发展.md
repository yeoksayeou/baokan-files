The People's Commune Shines, Sheep are Fat and Horses are Stronger
Great Development in Xinjiang's Animal Husbandry

Urumqi, July 19th (by our reporter) - Since the beginning of spring, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has added more than 7 million lambs. The breeding and mating of large livestock are about to conclude, with over 800,000 young animals expected to survive.

After communization, the past single-operation, small-scale livestock production situation has been fundamentally changed. Now, people's communes, primarily focused on agriculture, have established specialized livestock teams and groups based on production brigades or teams. Communes with a larger proportion of animal husbandry have also established ranches. Communes have also established livestock management committees to rapidly and systematically develop animal husbandry. In pastoral areas, people's communes, to ensure the stable development of animal husbandry, have transferred about 50% of the labor force this year to form agricultural production teams, building water conservancy projects, reclaiming wasteland, and expanding planting areas to ensure self-sufficiency in grain and fodder. The Altay region, which has already achieved grain self-sufficiency, has expanded its planting area by more than 400,000 mu this year. Of the more than 1.16 million mu planted in the entire region, about 400,000 mu are for fodder and forage production, an increase of two times compared to last year. In the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture and the Baluntai and Bayinbuluke pastoral areas of Hejing County, in addition to building grassland water conservancy projects and improving natural pastures this year, 14,000 mu of feed crops have been cultivated and planted, achieving a surplus in forage.

The commune has also implemented a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, rationally utilizing grasslands, and gradually implementing settled grazing and zoned rotational grazing, greatly increasing the carrying capacity of natural pastures. The carrying capacity of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture's grasslands alone can be increased from the current 6.9 million head to more than 30 million head. Before communization, due to the inability to rationally utilize grasslands, a cooperative's livestock herd often had to be driven for days or ten days to half a month, traveling hundreds of kilometers, when transferring pastures, especially when transferring from winter pastures to spring pastures. Livestock, having just passed through the long winter and at the time when ewes were giving birth to a large number of lambs, often suffered massive deaths or abortions. After communization, many regions have uniformly planned grasslands and made reasonable arrangements at the county level. Now, the commune's livestock herds basically utilize nearby pastures for grazing, reducing livestock deaths and abortions.

The people's commune has implemented specialized management for livestock production and begun to adopt scientific management methods, such as reorganizing livestock herds and establishing breeding herds. This makes it possible to further improve livestock quality and conduct breed improvement work well. This year, all people's communes have universally strengthened feeding management and implemented the management methods of assigning livestock, personnel, pastures, and labor days. Members with grazing experience were assigned to graze livestock herds, and the survival rate of young livestock has been universally improved. The lamb survival rate in areas such as the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture and the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture is above 90%. After implementing specialized management, the Red Cross People's Commune in Nilka County, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, increased the weight of one-year-old breeding sheep from an average of more than 40 kilograms per head last year to 60 to 80 kilograms. The breeding rate of the 39 groups of breeding ewes that lambed this year increased by about 10% compared to last year.

Now, the production enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains is unprecedentedly high. They are seizing the key to livestock production, such as breeding large livestock, re-mating sheep, and producing feed, striving for a double leap forward in animal husbandry and agriculture this year.

### 公社放光芒　羊肥马更壮  新疆畜牧工作有大发展

    公社放光芒　羊肥马更壮
    新疆畜牧工作有大发展
    本报乌鲁木齐19日电　新疆维吾尔自治区入春以来，已增加羔羊七百多万只；目前大牲畜繁殖配种工作即将结束，成活幼畜将达八十多万头。
    公社化后，过去那种单一经营的、分散的小规模的畜牧业生产状况，从根本上得到改变。现在，以农业为主的人民公社，都以生产大队或生产队为基础，建立了畜牧业专业队和组；畜牧业比重较大的公社还办了牧场；公社并且成立了牧业管理委员会，迅速地有计划地发展畜牧业。在牧区，人民公社为了保证畜牧业稳定的发展，今年都抽调了50％左右的劳动力，组成农业生产队，兴修水利，开荒造田，扩大播种面积，保证粮食饲料自给。已经实现了粮食自给的阿勒泰专区今年就扩大了播种面积四十多万亩，全专区播种的一百一十六万多亩土地，其中作为饲料、饲草生产的约有四十万亩左右，比去年增加了两倍。巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州和靖县巴伦台、巴音布鲁克牧区，今年除兴修了草原水利，改良天然草场外，开垦播种的饲料作物有一万四千亩，达到草料自给有余。
    公社还实行了农牧业结合，合理地利用草原，逐步实行定居划区轮牧，大大提高了天然牧场的载畜量。仅伊犁哈萨克族自治州草原的载畜量，就可以从现在的六百九十多万头提高到三千多万头。公社化以前，由于草原不能合理利用，一个合作社的畜群在转移牧场时，往往要吆赶数日或十天半月，行走数百公里；特别是由冬牧场转移到春牧场时，牲畜刚刚渡过漫长的冬季，又正值母羊将大量产羔的时候，常常造成牲畜的大量死亡或流产。公社化以后，许多地区都以县为单位统一规划了草场，进行了合理安排，现在公社的畜群基本上都利用就近草场牧放，减少了牲畜的死亡和流产。
    人民公社对畜牧业生产实行了专业管理，开始采用科学的管理方法，进行整编畜群，建立育种群等措施，这样就有可能进一步提高牲畜质量，很好地进行品种改良工作。今年各人民公社普遍加强了饲养管理，实行定牲畜、定人员、定牧场、定劳动日的管理方法，抽调了有牧放经验的社员放牲畜群，幼畜的繁殖成活率普遍提高。克牧勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州、巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州等地的羊羔成活率都在90％以上。伊犁哈萨克族自治州尼勒克县的红十字人民公社，在实行了专业管理以后，一岁种羊的体重由去年每只平均四十多公斤，提高到六十至八十公斤。今年产羔的三十九群适龄母羊，繁殖率比去年提高了10％左右。
    现在，天山南北各族农牧民的生产积极性空前高涨，正在抓紧大牲畜配种、羊只复配、饲料生产等畜牧业生产关键，力争今年畜牧业和农业双双跃进。（王立忱）
