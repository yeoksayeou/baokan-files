    In Memory of Painter Yu Feian
  　Lao She

    The death of painter Yu Feian is a loss to the entire Chinese painting community!

    The painter was multi-talented: he could paint, write, carve seals, was skilled in cultivating flowers, raising pigeons, raising fish, and was good at appreciating ancient artifacts. The knowledge he gained from raising flowers and pigeons, etc., was all applied to his painting, so he was particularly skilled in painting, especially in flower and bird paintings.

    In terms of applying color and ink, the painter mostly followed the secret methods of the Song and Yuan dynasties, but his composition and depiction of objects were based on reality, so the flowers and trees under his brush were both quaint and creative. He attached great importance to sketching from life. Even in his later years, although he was already famous, he still paid close attention to observing various flowers, insects, and birds in order to be precise. Whenever peonies were in full bloom in the park, or when he heard of chrysanthemum exhibitions somewhere, he would definitely go to appreciate and sketch many drafts. Every time the chrysanthemums bloomed in my house, the painter would definitely come, wandering among the flowers, seeing the fine petals like needles, or the subtle and elegant colors, and often said, "How can this be painted? How can this be painted?" In fact, he was not afraid of difficulties; he tried every means to figure out how to paint what was most difficult to imitate. This is creation, because no one had painted it like this before.

    He was good at raising pigeons and wrote a special book on it. For the sake of promoting world peace, he painted various types of pigeons. He had years of observation on the posture of pigeons. However, once, friends asked him to create a large-scale painting of soaring pigeons, he found it difficult. Usually when releasing pigeons, he could only look up. He had never looked down on how pigeons fly from above. Therefore, he went to the city tower to look down at the rising and falling of the pigeons, and then began to paint. This serious attitude impressed many young painters.

    He insisted on daily practice, painting every day. He painted meticulous paintings, which took a lot of time. But after liberation, how many works did he create! This proves how diligent he was, never slacking off even in his old age. He only lived in three small rooms, but he did not slack off due to the cramped environment. Painting was his life. As soon as he picked up the brush, he gained endless joy, tirelessly giving spring flowers and autumn plants to the masses. Yes, his works were appreciated by both the refined and the popular, and received universal praise. In his later years, the flowers under his brush were particularly bright. He said: The colorful and diverse, competing for beauty, are enough to match the new atmosphere of the new society.

    Yes, he loved the new society. He sincerely appreciated the Party's concern and care for him personally and for traditional painting. To express his personal gratitude to the Party, he carved a seal with the inscription "Reborn." When he was sick in the hospital, what he was still thinking about was that painters should be close to the Party and develop the cause of Chinese painting under the leadership of the Party.

    After entering the hospital, he was extremely optimistic. He believed that he would regain his health and create more and better works. However, the pain took his life, and the extremely exquisite "Peony and Pigeon" that is currently on display at the Huafang Studio has become his last work!

    Mr. Yu Feian, rest in peace! Your uniquely styled works will be passed down. Your disciples will not only inherit your painting methods and become a school, but also carry forward your spirit of diligent study and hard work, striving for the achievement of surpassing the master throughout their lives. Your friends in the painting community are now united very well, and will be even better. The development of Chinese painting can indeed achieve a hundred flowers blooming and bring forth new ideas! Rest in peace, Mr. Feian! Our country is undergoing a great rejuvenation and is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong. Our art cause is also flourishing and full of vitality!

    悼于非闇画师
  　老舍
    于非闇画师的病故是全国画界的损失！
    画师多才多艺：能画，能写，能刻印，善莳花，豢鸽，养鱼，并善于鉴赏古器。从养花养鸽等等得来的知识，都运用在绘画上，所以他特精绘事，尤精于花卉翎毛。
    画师在施彩运墨方面，多遵宋元秘法，可是构图状物，一本真实，所以他笔下的一花一木既饶古趣，又有所创造。他极重写生。即在晚年，虽已成名，可是还时刻留神观察百卉虫鸟，以求精确。每逢公园牡丹盛开，或某处闻有菊花展览，他必去详为赏览，勾画底稿多幅。每值我家菊开，画师必来，徘徊花间，见细瓣如针，或色微韵秀，频谓“这怎么画呢？怎么画呢？”事实上，他并不畏难；他千方百计地想办法，把最不易摹拟的画了出来。这便是创造，因为前人没有这么画过。
    他善养鸽，著有专书。为了保卫世界和平的宣传，他画过各种各式的鸽子。对鸽子的姿态，他有多年的观察。可是，有一次朋友们求他作大幅的翔鸽图，他为了难。平日放鸽，他只能仰观。他没从上俯视过鸽子如何飞翔。于是，他就到城楼上去俯视鸽群的起落，而后动笔描画。这种严肃的态度，使许多青年画家受到感动。
    他坚执日课，每日必画。他画工笔画，费时间较多。可是在解放后，他有多少作品啊。这证明他是如何精勤，至老不懈。他只住着三间小屋，但是他不因环境局促，而稍弛怠。绘画就是他的生命，一拿起笔来，他就得到无穷的乐趣，日夕不息地把春花秋卉赠给广大群众。是的，他的作品是雅俗共赏，受到普遍称赞的。到了晚年，他笔下的群芳特别明艳。他说：万紫千红，争奇斗艳，才足以配合新社会的新气象。
    是的，他热爱新社会。他衷心感激党对他个人与对传统绘画的关切与爱护。为表示他个人对党的感激，他刻了一块图章，文曰“再生”。当他卧病医院的时候，他还念念不忘的就是画家要靠近党，在党的领导下发展国画事业。
    入医院之后，他极为乐观。他相信自己会恢复健康，会创作出更多更好的作品来。可是，病痛夺去了他的生命，现在正在画舫斋展出的他的那幅极精彩的“牡丹鸽子”遂成绝笔！
    非闇先生，安息吧！您的独具风格的作品会流传下去，您的徒弟们不但会继承您的画法，成为流派，而且也会发扬您的勤学苦练的精神，毕生不懈地争取青出于蓝而胜于蓝的成就。您的画界朋友们现在团结得很好，而且会更好，国画的发展的确可以作到百花齐放，推陈出新！安息吧，非暗先生！我们的国家正在百废俱兴，日趋富强，我们的美术事业也随之而欣欣向荣，生机活跃！
