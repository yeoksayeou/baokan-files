    Grasping the Key Link in Running Good Spare-Time Education
    Harbin Tries Every Possible Means to Improve the Teaching Level of Spare-Time Teachers
    (Our report) Based on the rapid development of worker education in the first half of this year, Harbin has firmly grasped the central link of improving the teaching level of teachers, so that the city's worker spare-time education has been consolidated and improved.
    Since the beginning of this year, the number of young and middle-aged workers attending spare-time schools in Harbin has reached 70% of the total number of young and middle-aged workers, an increase of 23% compared with last year. The number of full-time and part-time teachers has also increased from the original 4,700 to more than 8,000.
    More than half of these teachers are new. Some of them are not clear enough about the purpose and task of teaching different courses to different classes and different teaching objects, either one-sidedly teaching Chinese lessons as political lessons, or simply focusing on trivial imparting of grammar knowledge; some do not know how to prepare lesson plans, do not know how to prepare lessons, and are relatively unfamiliar with teaching methods, so they often spend several times the time preparing lessons, but feel that there is nothing to talk about after teaching for half a class; some are limited by their political and cultural level, and cannot thoroughly understand and exert the content of the text, or because of lack of production knowledge, they only talk about abstract mathematical theorems, and do not explain in combination with production practice. Therefore, the students reflected that they could not understand the "geometric language" taught by the teacher in geometry class; the Chinese class was a "four-times teaching method" of reading "high, low, fast, slow" once each, which the students were not interested in.
    In view of the above situation, the Harbin Municipal Workers' Education Committee conducted a special study and discussion, and took the following measures to improve the teaching level of teachers: organizing more than 1,500 full-time teachers and some part-time teachers in the city to systematically study the Party's policy of serving production through worker education in the form of education work conferences, and regularly discussing and studying the problems existing in teaching work; the municipal and district leaders also organized forces to conduct in-depth teaching quality inspections in Harbin Linen Factory, Meat Processing Factory, Hongguang Candy Factory, etc. in a detailed manner by listening to lectures, participating in teaching research activities, etc., and the basic units also conducted self-examinations, and the municipal teaching research core group conducted research based on the main problems raised in the teaching quality, summarized typical experiences, and promoted them in a timely manner. In addition, the Municipal Education Bureau regularly held "Worker Teaching Business Lectures", organizing teachers with rich experience to give lectures on "The Task of Worker Education and the Role of Teachers", "Teaching Principles and Teaching Methods", etc., to systematically improve teachers' teaching business level.
    In terms of carrying out teaching research activities, Harbin has rectified and strengthened the teaching research organizations in various districts and at the grassroots level. The workers' schools in large factories have specially organized teaching research groups, and small units have organized joint groups by district or industry. Each small unit has established a worker joint school, and then the full-time teachers of each joint school in the district have been divided into joint teaching and research groups according to subjects to regularly study teaching plans, teaching principles and methods, and then the full-time teachers have returned to school as the backbone to lead the part-time teachers to carry out teaching research activities. In addition, Daowai, Daoli, Nangang and other districts in Harbin have also held short-term teacher training classes on "Junior High School Chinese, Mathematics" and "Senior Elementary School Chinese" teaching methods, organizing some full-time and part-time teachers in the district to conduct half-day study.
    While improving the teaching business of teachers, Harbin has also focused on improving the political and cultural level of teachers. Now the city has formed a teacher training network from the city to the grassroots level, and nearly a thousand full-time and part-time teachers are conducting spare-time or full-time further studies in the Municipal Teacher Training College and the teacher training classes attached to the cadre training classes in the district.

    抓住了办好业余教育的环节
    哈尔滨市千方百计提高业余教师教学水平
    本报讯　哈尔滨市在今年上半年职工教育迅速发展的基础上，紧紧抓住提高教师教学水平的中心环节，使全市的职工业余教育得到巩固和提高。
    今年以来，哈尔滨市青壮年职工上业余学校的人数已达到青壮年职工总数的70％，比去年增加23％。专职和兼职教师也由原来四千七百人增加到八千余人。
    这些教师中有一半以上是新手。他们有的对不同班级、不同教学对象在各门课程教学上的目的任务不够明确，不是偏于一面把语文课教成政治课，就是单纯偏重琐碎地传授语法知识；有的不会编教案、不会备课，对教学方法比较生疏，因此常常花了几倍时间备课，却教不了半堂就感到没啥讲了；有的受政治和文化水平限制，不能透彻理解和发挥课文内容，或因缺乏生产知识，只讲抽象数学定理，不会结合生产实际进行讲解。因此，学员反映老师上几何课，讲的“几何话”听不懂；上语文课是“高、低、快、慢”各念一遍的“四遍教学法”，学员不感兴趣。
    哈尔滨市职工教育委员会根据以上情况，进行了专题研究和讨论，并采取以下措施来提高教师的教学水平：通过教育工作会议的形式组织全市一千五百余名专职教师和部分兼职教师系统学习了党的职工教育为生产服务的方针，经常讨论和研究教学工作中存在的问题；市和区领导上还分别组织力量通过听课、参加教学研究活动等形式，重点深入哈尔滨亚麻厂、肉类加工厂、红光糖果厂等细致地进行教学质量的检查，各基层单位也进行了自查，并由市的教学研究核心组根据教学质量中提出的主要问题进行研究，总结典型经验，及时推广。另外市教育局定期举办“职工教学业务讲座”，组织有丰富经验的教师主讲“职工教育的任务和教师的作用”、“教学原则和教学法”等，系统提高教师的教学业务水平。
    在开展教学研究活动方面，哈尔滨市整顿和加强了各区和基层教学研究组织，大厂职工学校专门组织教学研究组，小单位按地区或行业分片联合组织。各小单位办成职工联校，再把全区各联校专职教师分学科组成联合教研组，定期研究教学计划、教学原则和方法，然后以专职教师为骨干分别回校带动兼职教师进行教学研究活动。此外，哈尔滨道外、道里、南岗等区还分别举办了“初中语文、数学”、“高小语文”教学法等短期师资训练班，组织本区部分专职和兼职教师进行半脱产的学习。
    在提高教师教学业务的同时，哈尔滨市还着重从政治和文化上提高师资水平。现在全市已形成从市区到基层的教师培训网，有近千名专职和部分兼职教师正在市教师进修学院、区的干部进修班附设的师资训练班进行业余或脱产进修。　（纪静如）（附图片）
