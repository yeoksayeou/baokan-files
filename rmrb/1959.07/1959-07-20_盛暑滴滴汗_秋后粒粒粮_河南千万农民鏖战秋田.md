Heavy Sweat in the Scorching Heat, Plentiful Grain After Autumn
Millions of Farmers in Henan Battle in the Autumn Fields

Zhengzhou, July 19th (People's Daily) - Over ten million farmers in Henan Province are braving the summer heat to battle in the autumn fields, striving to achieve "six withouts" (no weeds, no missing seedlings, no broken ridges, no pests, no soil compaction, no barren or thin land) on every plot, and striving for a bumper autumn harvest.

This year, Henan Province's over 107 million mu of autumn crops are generally growing well. Currently, early-sown corn and sorghum have begun to tassel, sesame and peanuts are vying to bloom, and large cotton fields are filled with bolls on the branches. Late-sown corn and millet are also growing vigorously. Entering July, rainfall has been frequent, leading to rampant weed growth in some autumn fields, and some have also experienced pest infestations. To ensure a bumper autumn harvest, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Henan Provincial People's Committee recently convened consecutive telephone conferences and broadcast meetings for the first secretaries of various regions and cities, calling on all localities to focus on the two key months of July and August, launching a campaign of inter-tillage, weeding, pest control, and fertilizer accumulation, striving to achieve "six withouts" on every plot of autumn fields.

"Hoeing the land is like applying fertilizer, the more you hoe, the tenderer the seedlings become." To completely eliminate weeds, various localities have adopted continuous concentrated assault methods to fight against weeds. In the recent weeding assault week in the Kaifeng area, 50,000 cadres and over 2.3 million laborers were mobilized daily, working hard for five days to eliminate weeds on 2.88 million mu of autumn fields, accounting for 88% of the weedy area. After summarizing their experience from last year's thirteen mu of corn, where the same conditions but plowing twice yielded ten more kilograms of corn per mu than plowing once, the Changzhuang Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Nanyang County immediately plowed all early and late autumn crops once, and planned to plow all autumn fields three to five times in the recent month. In the weeding campaign, various localities also vigorously reformed autumn field management tools. The Shilipu Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Dengfeng County has a large area of land but a small population, and there has been wasteland every year in the past. This year, due to the widespread promotion of a livestock-powered weeding cultivator, two people and one animal can cultivate ten to twelve mu per day, thus quickly eliminating weed infestation. According to incomplete statistics, the province has created and imitated more than one million pieces of inter-tillage, pest control, and fertilization tools, greatly improving work efficiency.

Various localities have combined weeding with vigorous fertilizer accumulation and composting. After Guangshan County implemented the policy of pricing fertilizer based on quality and reasonably remunerating, the enthusiasm of commune members for accumulating fertilizer has been greatly increased. Yingju Brigade of Yingju Commune in Fengqiu County combined weeding with vigorous composting of liquid fertilizer.

To reduce the harm of insect pests, various localities have also conscientiously strengthened pest monitoring work, seizing favorable opportunities for pest control and cleverly fighting against pests on various crops. In the struggle to prevent and control cotton bollworms in the Xinxiang area, production teams in cotton-producing areas have trained special pest control technicians in each team, mastering the growth patterns of the insects. After initial prevention and control, most cotton fields have achieved pest control efficiency of 80% to 90%. According to provincial statistics, a total of 7.98 million mu have been affected by cotton bollworms, aphids, corn and millet borers, and rice leaf rollers, with a control area of 97%.

Various localities have also organized a large number of cadres to go deep into the grassroots, conscientiously strengthening leadership over autumn field management. The Kaifeng area has designated July as the Autumn Field Management Movement Month, with more than 60% of the cadres going deep into the fields, eating, working, studying, and recording work points together with the masses, and jointly discussing and solving problems, powerfully promoting the autumn field management movement. Party secretaries at all levels in Shangqiu County went deep into the fields to conduct inspections and evaluations, greatly improving the labor enthusiasm of the masses, and the labor force participating in autumn field management in the county increased from more than 60,000 to 160,000. Six county party secretaries, 140 commune party secretaries, and 1,500 brigade and team cadres in Changyuan County personally engaged in high-yield plots, driving the county's autumn field topdressing area to quickly reach 48%. Now, the county's 240,000 mu of early autumn crops have been generally hoed three times, with more than 190,000 mu hoed four times, and 540,000 mu of late autumn crops have also been hoed twice.

### 盛暑滴滴汗　秋后粒粒粮  河南千万农民鏖战秋田

    盛暑滴滴汗　秋后粒粒粮
    河南千万农民鏖战秋田
    本报郑州19日电　河南省一千多万农民冒暑鏖战秋田，力争块块实现“六无”（无杂草，无缺苗，无断垅，无虫害，无板结，无瘦田薄地），争取秋季农业大丰收。
    今年河南省的一亿零七百多万亩秋季作物，普遍生长良好。现在，早播玉米、高粱已经开始抽穗，芝麻、花生争相开花，大片棉田伏桃盈枝；晚播的玉米、谷子生长也很茁壮。进入7月，雨水频繁，部分秋田杂草丛生，有的并且发生虫害。为保证秋季农业大丰收，中共河南省委和河南省人民委员会最近连续召开了各地、市委第一书记电话会议和广播大会，号召各地抓好7月、8月两个关键月，展开中耕、除草、治虫、积肥运动，力争秋田块块实现“六无”。
    “锄地如上粪，越锄苗越嫩”。为彻底消灭杂草，各地采取了连续集中突击的方法，
  与杂草搏斗。开封专区在最近的锄草突击周中，每日出动五万名干部、二百三十多万劳力，奋战五天，消灭有杂草的秋田二百八十八万亩，占草荒面积88％。南阳县城关公社常庄大队在总结了他们去年种的十三亩玉米，同样条件、中耕两遍的比中耕一遍的每亩多收玉米十斤的经验后，全队立即把所有的早晚秋作物锄了一遍，并且计划在最近的一个多月里，要把全部秋田普遍中耕三遍至五遍。在除草运动中，各地还大力改革秋田管理工具。登封县城关公社十里铺大队，地多人少，过去年年都有荒地。今年因为普遍推广了一种畜力锄草耧，二人一畜一天能锄十亩到十二亩，因而很快消灭了草荒。全省据不完全统计，共已创制和仿制中耕、治虫、施肥工具一百多万件，大大提高了工效。
    各地结合锄草，大抓积肥、沤肥。光山县全县贯彻因肥计价，合理计酬的积肥政策以后，大大提高社员们的积肥积极性。封丘县应举公社应举大队结合除草，大沤汤肥。
    为减轻虫灾危害，各地还认真加强了虫情测报工作，抓紧除虫有利时机，巧战各种作物的虫害。新乡专区在防治棉铃虫的斗争中，各产棉地区的生产队，队队都培训了专门的除虫技术员，掌握了虫子的生长规律。绝大部分棉田经过初步防治以后，除虫效率达到80％到90％。据全省统计，共发生棉铃虫、蚜虫、玉米、谷子钻心虫和稻苞虫等共七百九十八万亩，防治面积达97％。
    各地还组织大批干部深入基层，认真加强对秋田管理的领导。开封专区已确定7月份为秋田管理运动月，全区60％以上的干部都深入田间，和群众同吃、同劳动、同学习、同记工分，共同商量解决问题，有力地推动了秋田管理运动。商丘县各级党委书记深入田间，进行检查评比，大大提高了群众的劳动积极性，全县参加秋田管理的劳力由原来的六万多人增到十六万人。长垣县六个县委书记、一百四十名公社党委书记和一千五百名社、队干部，亲自动手大搞丰产方，带动全县秋田追肥面积很快达到了48％。现在这县的二十四万亩早秋作物已普锄三遍，锄过四遍的已达十九万多亩，五十四万亩晚秋作物也已经锄了两遍。（戴德义、阚枫）
