    Hurry and Do Well

    Today, this newspaper published a report about the Lian Tang Ao Commune in You County, Hunan Province, carefully harvesting and threshing early rice. This raises an issue worthy of attention. The brigade used its own experience to show us: early rice can be harvested faster and threshed cleaner.

    With the fragrance of rice pervading thousands of miles and gold spread all over the land, the south is about to enter a season of intense activity for harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice. To ensure the timely harvest of the fruits of our labor and to sow the seeds of late autumn crops in due season, we must race against time to harvest and plant. Since it's a race to harvest and plant, we must naturally emphasize speed to win time. However, speed and quality must be closely linked, otherwise, we will achieve the opposite of what we intend. Taking the rush harvest as an example, we must seize the season and harvest in a timely manner, while also ensuring careful threshing and harvesting, returning every grain to the granary. This is the only way to guarantee a bumper harvest.

    Careful harvesting and threshing, with every grain returned to the granary, to achieve a bumper harvest, is originally the demand of the broad masses. People are not afraid of sun and rain, working hard, all to strive for a greater harvest. Now that gold is spread all over the land, how can people not want every grain to return to the granary? Some people oppose speed and quality, saying that speed makes it difficult to achieve quality, and quality makes it difficult to achieve speed. This view is contrary to the demands of the broad masses and inconsistent with reality. The experience of many places in the past has proven, and today's experience of Hou City Brigade proves once again, that as long as labor is reasonably arranged, certain operating procedures are formulated, and a sound responsibility system is established, both speed and quality can be achieved. For example: identifying rice seedlings plot by plot, mastering the timing of maturity well, and implementing the method of harvesting the ripe first and the unripe later; another example: rationally arranging labor, combining the strong and the weak, combining the skilled and the unskilled, and arranging labor properly in all aspects of harvesting, threshing, transporting, and drying, and ensuring that each link is closely linked and strictly follows certain operating procedures. These practices and experiences are effective ways to improve both work efficiency and ensure quality.

    Of course, it is impossible to achieve a complete victory in any work without the Party's political and ideological work. The Hou City Brigade's early rice harvest this year was successful. In addition to a series of organizational measures, the main thing was to carry out ideological education work on bumper harvests for the masses. The broad masses are eager to bring back all the fruits of the harvest. However, some people are prone to the thought that "losing a few grains is a trivial matter, it doesn't matter" in the face of a bumper harvest. Party organizations at all levels, especially the commune Party committees, should conduct a thorough and meticulous ideological education campaign for all commune members before the harvest begins. Explain to each commune member clearly: the principle that small things add up to big things, and that trickles of water flow into rivers; use concrete facts to illustrate: one granary after another of golden grains is gathered from one grain at a time. In the various stages of cutting, threshing, transporting, and drying, just a slight loss will result in an astonishing amount of waste. Wasting a few grains in one field may be a small matter, but for a commune, a county, a province, or even the whole country, it is not a small matter, but a big matter that concerns whether a bumper yield can become a bumper harvest, and a big matter that concerns the further improvement of people's lives. We believe that as long as we do a good job in the political and ideological work of the commune members and in the organizational work of the rush harvest and planting, we will certainly be able to achieve a victory of bumper yield and bumper harvest, and we will certainly be able to do a fast and good job in the rush harvest and planting work.

### 快和好

专栏：短评

    快和好
    今天本报发表的湖南省攸县莲塘坳公社细收细打早稻的消息，提出了一个值得重视的问题，这个大队用自己的事实向我们表明：早稻可以收的更快，能够打的更净。
    稻香千里，黄金遍地，南方各地就要进入紧张的抢收早稻、抢插晚稻的季节了。为了把丰收的劳动果实及时地收到手，为了把晚秋作物的种子适时地播下去，就要抢收抢种。既然是抢收抢种，自然就要讲究快，才能赢得时间。但快和好必须紧密联系起来，否则就会造成“欲速则不达”。以抢收为例，既要抢住季节，适时收割，又要细打细收，颗粒还家，这样才能保证丰产丰收。
    细收细打，颗粒归仓，达到丰产丰收，本来就是广大群众的要求。人们不怕日晒雨淋，辛勤劳动，都无非是为了夺取更大的丰收。如今遍地黄金，人们怎么不想它颗粒归仓呢？有人把快和好对立起来，说快了就难好，要好就难快。这种看法既违背广大群众的要求，也不符合实际情况。过去有许多地方的经验已经证明，今天侯市大队的经验又一次证明，只要合理安排劳力，制订一定的操作规程，建立和健全责任制度，就能做到既快又好。比如：逐丘逐块鉴定禾苗，很好地掌握火候，实行先熟先收，后熟后收的办法；又如：合理安排好劳力，强弱搭配，技术高低搭配，收、打、运、晒各个环节劳力安排得当，并且环环紧扣，严格按照一定的操作规程行事。这些作法和经验，都是既能提高工效，又能保证质量的有效办法。
    当然，任何工作要想取得全胜，离开党的政治思想工作是不可能的，侯市大队今年早稻的收获工作做的好，除了采取了一系列的组织措施以外，主要的是对群众进行了丰产丰收的思想教育工作。广大群众都迫切要求把丰收的果实全部拿回来，可是，有些人在大丰收面前也容易产生一种“丢几粒是小事，算不了什么”的思想。各级党组织特别是公社党委，要在开镰收割以前向全体社员深入细致地作一次思想教育工作。向每一个社员讲清楚：有小然后才能有大，涓涓之水流成江河的道理；要用具体的事实说明：一仓又一仓的金黄色的谷子，是由一粒一粒聚集起来的，在割、打、运、晒各个环节中，只要稍微丢失一些，浪费的数字就会大得惊人。浪费几粒谷在一丘田来说，也许是小事，但就一个公社、一个县、一个省、甚至全国来说，那就不是什么小事，而是关系丰产能不能丰收的大事情，关系着人民生活进一步改善的大事情。我们相信，只要作好社员的政治思想工作和作好抢收抢种的组织工作，我们就一定能够取得丰产又丰收的胜利，就一定能够把抢收抢种工作做得又快又好。
