    Prepare for Next Year's Summer Harvest

    At this time last year, we also wrote an editorial emphasizing that winter planting preparations should be brought forward from winter to summer. In that editorial, it was explained that this approach was in line with the requirements of the leadership method advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong, which is "Look at the first year for three years, and look at the previous winter for the first year." Practice has proven that this approach is successful. This year, the summer harvest crops in many regions have increased significantly compared to last year, precisely because last summer, attention was paid to arranging the work for an even greater harvest in the coming year. Therefore, regions such as Hubei, Xinjiang, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, and Sichuan have already begun to arrange winter planting preparations early, which is a very gratifying phenomenon.

    Bringing winter planting preparations forward by a few months allows for full utilization of time to set more realistic targets, formulate more specific measures, arrange labor more rationally, select better seeds, accumulate more fertilizer, and so on, so as to lay a good foundation for next year's summer harvest early on. However, bringing winter planting preparations forward by a few months is not simply a matter of method, but also a matter of thought; one must have the thought of continuous revolution, be good at considering the next task in a timely manner before one task is completed, and be good at considering the summer harvest next year when harvesting this summer, or even further, considering the harvest of the entire agricultural production next year in advance. Only with this kind of thinking is it possible to bring forward winter planting preparations. As a leader, one must also have this kind of thinking. The so-called foresight of leadership is also manifested here.

    Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the comprehensive and balanced development within agriculture has become even more important. This issue was already noted during the First Five-Year Plan; however, due to lack of experience, agriculture has not been able to fully achieve comprehensive and balanced development. For example, the development of animal husbandry has lagged behind the development of agriculture, and thus, it cannot meet the requirements of agriculture for draught power and fertilizer; nor can it meet the needs of society for meat and other foods. Within agriculture, oil crops have also consistently lagged behind grain crops, and edible oil is in short supply. To require comprehensive and balanced development of agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and of grain crops and cash crops, it is necessary to carry out various preparations in advance. In the preparation work, it is also necessary to look ahead and behind, and arrange land, labor, and funds in a comprehensive and rational manner. For example, in the winter planting preparation work, it is possible to make unified and reasonable arrangements for winter wheat, rapeseed, and miscellaneous grains to be sown after the autumn harvest, as well as for forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and sideline occupations that need to be carried out in the coming winter and spring, to ensure that they can all be developed.

    When starting winter planting preparations, the first thing to do is to be full of confidence and go all out to strive for a continued bumper summer harvest next year. The increase in summer harvest crops this year is uneven. The area with a yield of over 300 jin per mu is quite large, but the area with a yield of less than 100 jin per mu is also not small. This shows that those with a yield of over 300 jin per mu can still rise to 400 jin, 500 jin, 600 jin, and even over 1,000 jin, and many places have already seen large areas of high-yielding fields with yields of 1,000 jin this year; those with a yield of less than 100 jin per mu should quickly catch up and strive for 100 jin, 150 jin, 200 jin. Similarly, there have been high-yielding fields this year that were originally low-yielding but are now high-yielding. This huge difference shows that there is a very large potential for striving for a bumper summer harvest next year. As long as we have drive and measures, we can definitely continue to achieve a bumper harvest on the basis of this year.

    On the other hand, we can also expand the planting area to increase the total output. A very important experience this year is that although the yield per unit area of summer harvest crops has greatly increased, the total output in many places has not increased much or has not increased at all because the planting area has been reduced a lot. In this year's winter planting, we must resolutely implement the policy of "planting more and harvesting more," and ensure that the planting area of wheat is not less than or basically restored to the planting area of the previous year. Rapeseed and miscellaneous grains should also be increased. In this way, the total output of summer harvest crops next year can be greatly increased. Therefore, when preparing for winter planting this time, we must pay attention to both increasing the yield per unit area and increasing the total output. Neglecting any aspect will not achieve the goal of a continued bumper harvest.

    From the experience of many places, to unify the understanding of striving for a bumper summer harvest next year, we must start by summarizing the experience of this year's summer harvest crop success. When summarizing the summer harvest experience, we can rank them according to the yield per mu of a large area, and analyze why some are over 1,000 jin, some are 300 jin or 500 jin, and some are less than 100 jin, what are the conditions, and what are the experiences. After this kind of summary, we can unify the understanding of next year's summer harvest. On this ideological basis, mobilize the masses to discuss and confirm the plans for winter wheat, miscellaneous grains, and rapeseed to be sown after the autumn harvest, and implement the planting area and yield targets to the contract units. The planting area plan should be implemented according to the conditions of the cultivated land, the need for planting green manure, and the arrangement of previous and subsequent crops, and the yield per mu plan should be implemented on the basis of increasing 10%, 20%, or 30% of the actual yield of this year's summer harvest. After the planting plan is implemented, it should be reviewed and summarized level by level from bottom to top, and finally finalized. In this way, the planting plan can be confirmed in July and the first half of August, and the enthusiasm of the masses can be mobilized one or two months before the winter sowing, to strive for the realization of next year's bumper harvest.

    On the other hand, it is the preparation of material aspects. If the ideological aspect has already put forward specific indicators for next year's bumper harvest, the material aspect must be prepared according to this specific indicator. Separately speaking, the first step is to ensure that three types of seedlings do not appear before and during sowing; the second step is to ensure that there are many plants, many ears, large ears, and large grains after sowing. Is it possible to do these things? Yes, it is possible. Xiangyang Special District in Hubei has already determined specific goals in this regard: first, eliminate white seeds from entering the fields and apply sufficient base fertilizer; second, deep plow and meticulously prepare the fields; third, sow appropriately to achieve rational close planting (see page 1 of this newspaper on the 20th). Other regions also have this experience: as long as the four measures of water, fertilizer, soil, and seeds are well implemented, three types of seedlings will not appear. Even if three types of seedlings do appear, they can quickly be raised to two types of seedlings or one type of seedlings. Therefore, winter sowing preparation work must also start from the four aspects of water, fertilizer, soil, and seeds.

    Through the struggle of last year and this year, great achievements have been made in water conservancy. However, it must also be admitted that we are still far from the goal of national agricultural water conservancy, and we need to continue to build large-scale water conservancy projects. In particular, many water conservancy projects that have already been built have not been able to fully play their role because they have not built channels or have not leveled the land. To ensure that next year's summer harvest crops are not threatened by drought or flooding, the unfinished water conservancy projects must be completed quickly, the channels that have not been built must be built quickly, and the land that has not been leveled must be leveled quickly, or leave space and prepare to rebuild. When leaving channels, don't think too far and leave too much land. In a word, first concentrate efforts to improve the existing water conservancy irrigation projects and let them truly play their role. In places where there are no water conservancy projects or few water conservancy projects, actively build them. Therefore, after the autumn harvest, it is also necessary to carry out mass water conservancy movements. Now, we must make various preparations for this movement.

    In recent years, the growth rate of fertilizer has not been slow. Therefore, it has successively met the fertilizer requirements of last year's agricultural Great Leap Forward and this year's summer harvest, but the growth rate of fertilizer is still not keeping up with the speed of agricultural development. Fertilizer was relatively tight in this year's summer sowing. Either the base fertilizer requirements for summer sowing could not be met, or the topdressing fertilizer requirements for autumn harvest crops could not be met. The main reason for this fertilizer shortage is that the quality of the fertilizer accumulated is not high. Therefore, from now on, we must carry out mass fertilizer accumulation movements and mobilize the masses to accumulate and produce a large amount of fertilizer before the autumn. In the accumulation and production of fertilizer, we must pay attention to fertilizer efficiency and improve the fertilizer knowledge of farmers and cadres, so that they understand not to use those fertilizer accumulation and production methods that consume a lot of labor, do not increase fertilizer content, and even reduce or lose fertilizer content. In the accumulation and production of fertilizer, we must also pay attention to basic fertilizer construction. Raising pigs, raising sheep, and raising cattle and horses are the most important basic construction for developing fertilizer. Anle Brigade of Xieqiao Commune in Haining County, Zhejiang Province, calculated the following account: if they resolutely complete the plan of raising three pigs and sheep per mu, this team can prepare 244,000 dan of high-quality organic fertilizer for agricultural production in one year. Calculated at 80 dan per mu, it will solve 70% to 80% of the fertilizer for the entire team. With the addition of other fertilizers, the fertilizer of this team will be completely solved. Therefore, we must immediately implement the policy of walking on two legs, giving equal importance to public and private raising, and mobilize communes, production teams, and members to raise more pigs and sheep and accumulate more high-quality fertilizer.

    Deep plowing and improving the soil is one of the measures to increase production. The reason why the yield of wheat this year can be increased by another 10% to 30% on the basis of last year is that deep plowing has played a certain role. In this year's winter planting, the original plowing layer needs to be deepened if it is too shallow; the original soil layer is too thin and not suitable for deep plowing, it needs to be processed and thickened. It is inappropriate to mechanically stipulate that "planting is not allowed if the deep plowing is not one and a half feet deep"; but it is more reasonable to require that universal deep plowing and deep turning be done as much as possible before sowing, with deep plowing of seven, eight inches and about one foot. To achieve universal deep plowing and deep turning, it is necessary to start arranging labor and animal power in advance and improve deep plowing tools.

    Seeds must be selected well, kept well, stored well, and a certain number of backup seeds must be kept. The experience of many places this year proves that the benefits of rational close planting must be affirmed. Increasing the amount of sowing can directly increase the number of plants and ears per unit area, and narrowing the row spacing can make the wheat evenly distributed, maintain a certain nutritional area for a single plant, and ensure large and many ears. Therefore, sufficient seeds must be kept. In order to avoid variety homogenization, several varieties should be kept. As everyone knows, Bima No. 1 is an excellent variety, but in the past one or two years, it has seriously lost its ability to resist rust in Guanzhong area of Shaanxi and south-central Henan. Keeping more varieties, even if one variety degenerates, will not affect the entire yield; in addition, with more varieties, the harvest period can not be crowded within one time.

    Finally, we should actively help grassroots cadres, help them improve their working methods, strengthen specific leadership over winter planting work, prevent both coercion and commandism and prevent letting things drift, and be good at closely combining strengthening leadership and the mass line; we must learn this working method, only in this way can we have another bumper harvest next summer.

### 为明年夏季大丰收做好准备

专栏：社论

    为明年夏季大丰收做好准备
    去年此时，我们也曾写过一篇社论，强调应该把冬种准备工作从冬天提早到夏天。在那篇社论中，说明了这种作法是符合毛泽东同志所提倡的“三年看头年，头年看前冬”的领导方法的要求的。实践证明，这种作法是成功的。今年很多地区的夏收作物都比去年增产很多，就是因为去年夏天就注意安排了下一年的更大丰收的工作。因此，今年湖北、新疆、贵州、陕西、河南、江苏和四川等地区已经早早开始安排冬种的准备工作，这是很可喜的现象。
    把冬种准备工作提早几个月，才能充分利用时间，把指标定得更加切合实际，把措施定得更加具体，把劳力安排得更加合理，把种子选得更好一点，把肥料积得更多一点等等，以便早早就动手为明年夏季大丰收打好基础。但是要把冬种准备工作提前几个月，不简单是个方法问题，也是个思想问题；要有不断革命的思想，要善于在一个工作结束之前，就及时考虑到下一个工作，善于在今年夏收的时候，就考虑到明年夏季丰收的问题，或者更远一点，提早考虑明年整个农业生产的丰收的问题。只有具备了这种思想，才有可能提早冬种准备工作。作为一个领导人员，也必须有这种思想。所谓领导的预见性，也表现在这里。
    从去年大跃进以来，农业内部的综合平衡发展显得更加重要了。对于这个问题，在第一个五年计划期间就已经注意到了；但是由于经验不足，农业内部还没有能够完全做到综合平衡发展。例如畜牧业的发展就落后于农业的发展，这样，也就不能满足农业对畜力和肥料的要求；不能满足社会对肉食等的要求。在农业内部，油料作物也一直落在粮食作物的后边，食油也就供不应求。要求农业和林业、牧业、副业与渔业，粮食作物和经济作物能够综合平衡地发展，就要提早进行各项准备工作。在准备工作中，又要瞻前顾后，全面合理地安排土地、劳力和资金。例如在冬种准备工作中，就可以对秋后播种的冬麦、油菜、杂粮，以及农业以外需要在今冬明春进行的林业、牧业、渔业和副业的工作，进行统一合理的安排，保证它们都能够得到发展。
    在着手冬种准备工作的时候，首先应该满怀信心地鼓足干劲，千方百计地争取明年夏季继续大丰收。今年夏收作物的增产幅度是不平衡的，亩产三百斤以上的面积相当大，但是亩产一百斤以下的也不小，这就说明了，亩产三百斤以上的，还可以上升到四百斤、五百斤、六百斤，以至一千斤以上，今年已有不少地方出现了大面积千斤丰产田；亩产一百斤以下的，应该迅速赶上来，争取一百斤、一百五十斤、二百斤，今年同样出现了原来低产现在高产的丰产田。这种巨大的差别，就说明争取明年夏季丰收是有着十分巨大的潜力的。只要我们有干劲有措施，一定可以在今年的基础上继续获得大丰收。
    另一方面还可以扩大播种面积，增加总产量。今年有一个很重要的经验，就是夏收作物的单位面积产量虽然有着很大的提高，但是许多地方因为播种面积减少了很多，这些地区的总产量就增加得不多，或者没有增加。今年冬种中，就要坚决贯彻执行多种多收的方针，保证小麦的播种面积不能少于或基本上恢复前年的播种面积。油菜、杂粮也要有所增加。这样，明年夏收作物的总产量就可以大大增加。所以，在这次准备冬种的时候，既要注意提高单位面积产量，又要注意提高总产量，忽略任何一面，都不能达到继续大丰收的目的。
    从许多地方的经验看来，要统一对争取明年夏季丰收的认识，必须从总结今年夏收作物丰收经验着手。在总结夏收经验的时候，可以按大面积的亩产量排队，分析它们中为什么有的是一千斤以上，有的是三百斤五百斤，有的是一百斤以下，各有什么条件，各有什么经验。经过这种总结以后，就可以统一对明年夏季丰收的认识。在这个思想基础上，发动群众讨论，把今年秋后播种的冬麦、杂粮、油菜的计划肯定下来，播种面积和产量指标落实到包产单位。播种面积的计划应该按照耕地的条件、种植绿肥的需要和前后茬口的安排来落实，亩产量计划要在今年夏收实收产量的基础上，增加一成、二成到三成来落实。播种计划落实之后，由下而上的逐级审查、汇总，最后定案。这样，在7月份和8月上半月就可以把播种计划肯定下来，可以在冬播前一两个月就把群众的积极性调动起来，为实现明年大丰收而奋斗。
    另一方面，是物质方面的准备工作。思想方面如果已经提出了明年的丰产的具体指标，物质方面就要按照这个具体指标来准备。分开来说，第一步，要在播种前和播种时就保证不会出现三类苗；第二步，保证播种以后株多、穗多，穗大、粒大。可不可以做到这些呢？可以做到。湖北襄阳专区在这方面已经确定了具体的奋斗目标：第一，消灭白籽下田，施足底肥；第二，深耕，精细整田；第三，播种量适当，作到合理密植。（见20日本报一版）其他地区也有这样的经验：只要水、肥、土、种四项措施执行得好，就可以不出现三类苗，即使出现了三类苗，也能够很快使它上升为二类苗或一类苗。因此，冬播准备工作，也必须从水、肥、土、种几项工作着手。
    经过去年和今年的奋斗，在水利方面获得了伟大成就。但是也必须承认，我们离全国耕地水利化的目标还相差很远，还需要继续大兴水利。特别是已经修起的水利工程，还有不少因为没有修起渠道，或者没有平整土地，而没有能够全部发挥作用。要保证明年夏收作物不受干旱或水涝的威胁，就要把这部分尚未完工的水利工程迅速完工，没有渠道的赶快修筑渠道，没有平整土地的赶快平整土地，或者留出地方，准备重修。留渠道的时候，不要想得太远，留地过多。一句话，首先集中力量把已有的水利灌溉工程搞好，让它真正发挥作用。没有水利工程或者水利工程不多的地方，就要积极兴修。因此，秋收以后，还要开展群众性的水利运动。现在，就要为这个运动做好各种准备工作。
    最近几年来，肥料增长的速度是不慢的，因此，接连满足了去年农业大跃进和今年夏季大丰收对肥料的要求，但是，肥料增长的速度仍是跟不上农业发展的速度，今年夏种中肥料就比较紧张，不是满足不了夏种基肥的要求，就是满足不了秋收作物的追肥要求。出现这种肥料紧张状态，主要是所积的肥料的质量不高。因此，从现在起，就要开展群众性的积肥运动，发动群众在秋前积制大量肥料。在积肥造肥中要讲求肥效，要注意提高农民和干部的集肥知识，使他们懂得，不要去使用那种耗费了很多劳动力，没有增加肥分，甚至减少或损失了肥分的积肥和造肥方法。在积肥造肥中还要注意肥料基本建设。养猪养羊养牛马，是发展肥料最重要的基本建设。浙江海宁县斜桥公社安乐大队算过这样一笔账：如果坚决完成每亩养猪羊三头的计划，这个队一年就可以为农业生产准备优质有机肥料二十四万四千担，以每亩施八十担计算，就为全队解决了70％到80％的肥料。加上其他肥料，这个队的肥料也就完全解决了。因此，现在立即要贯彻公养和私养并重的两条腿走路的方针，发动公社、生产队和社员，多多养猪养羊，多多积攒优质肥料。
    深耕、改良土壤是增产措施之一。今年小麦的产量所以能够在去年基础上，再提高10％到30％，深耕起了一定的作用。今年冬种中，原来耕层太浅的需要加深；原来土层太薄，不宜深耕的，要加工培厚。机械地规定“深耕不到一尺五不种”是不适当的；但是要求下种前尽可能作到普遍深耕深翻，深耕七寸、八寸和一尺左右是比较合理的。要做到普遍深耕深翻，就要提前着手安排劳力、畜力，改良深耕工具。
    种子一定要选好、留好、保管好，并且要留一定数量的后备种子。今年许多地方的经验证明：合理密植的好处是必须肯定的，增加播种量可以直接增加单位面积上的株数、穗数，缩小行距可以使小麦均匀分布，保持单株一定的营养面积，保证穗大穗多。因此，要留足种籽。为了避免品种单一化，要多留几个品种。大家知道，碧蚂一号是一种优良品种，但是近一二年来，在陕西关中地区，河南中南部已经严重丧失了它的抵抗锈病能力。多留几个品种，即使有一种品种发生退化现象，还不致影响整个产量；另外，品种多一点，收获期也可以不致挤在一个时间内。
    最后，应该积极帮助基层干部，帮助他们改进工作方法，加强对冬种工作的具体领导，既要防止强迫命令，也要防止放任自流，要善于把加强领导和群众路线密切地结合起来；我们必须学会这种工作方法，只有这样，我们在明年夏季才能再来一个大丰收。
