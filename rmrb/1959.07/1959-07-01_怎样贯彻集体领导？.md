How to Implement Collective Leadership?
The Writing Group of the CCP Wuchang Vehicle Factory Committee

Sound collective leadership is the prerequisite and foundation for strong unified leadership. Our factory's Party Committee has made some attempts and efforts to further enhance the role of collective leadership.

First, we insisted on holding good Party Committee plenary meetings or Standing Committee meetings and abolished the joint meetings of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League. Because the joint meetings of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League were actually "all-inclusive" meetings, and everything, no matter how trivial, had to be brought up for discussion, it weakened the collective leadership of the Party Committee, whether it was presided over by the factory director or the Party Secretary. In addition, such joint meetings often dealt with problems hastily and could not reach the appropriate ideological level.

Second, we strictly separated cadre meetings from Party Committee meetings, held fewer expanded Party Committee meetings, and held more Party Committee plenary meetings. Cadre meetings can be convened, but the problem is that they should not be used to replace Party Committee meetings in making resolutions. In order to pool ideas, it is perfectly appropriate to convene a few expanded Party Committee meetings; however, if meetings are frequently expanded with too many attendees, Party Committee members will not have sufficient opportunities to speak, which will weaken the sense of responsibility of collective leadership and will therefore be detrimental.

For documents drafted by the Party Committee, we insisted on adopting the method of discussing them at Party Committee meetings, instead of circulating them individually for comments and signatures. Because comments signed without discussion and comparison cannot be "refined through debate and clarified through explanation." Moreover, sometimes the signed comments differ, making it impossible to draw a conclusion. If the decision is made by the drafting department or the Party Secretary, it will undermine the collective leadership of the Party Committee.

In order to better concentrate collective wisdom and collective experience, our Party Committee insisted on the method of raising questions under leadership for discussion. In the past, when discussing issues at Party Committee meetings, the relevant comrades would often make a central speech, followed by everyone's discussion, and then the Party Secretary would make a concluding speech, which would be regarded as the decision of the meeting. In this way, even if the central speech was relatively well-prepared, the discussion would still be aimless, and the final conclusion would be difficult to represent and concentrate everyone's opinions, inevitably turning into a heavy rain and ending abruptly. Recently, we have made further attempts to raise several key questions after the central speech, focusing on in-depth discussion, and finally making a generalized conclusion based on everyone's opinions. Obviously, this conclusion is not the idea of the Party Secretary alone, but the collective creation of all members of the Party Committee.

What should be grasped?
What should be discussed?

The Party Committee should lead everything in the factory, but that does not mean that it should grasp everything and discuss everything.

In the past, almost every monthly production plan of our factory had to be submitted to the Party Committee meeting for discussion. Because production issues were extremely complicated, the Party Committee's four monthly meetings were almost entirely spent discussing daily production. Recent practice has shown that this type of issue can be handled by the relevant parties, so that the Party Committee can free up its hands to study and grasp more important issues.

What should the factory Party Committee mainly grasp and discuss? Our experience is that focusing on grasping the situation, grasping ideology, and grasping the direction will achieve greater results. For example, in January of this year, our Party Committee conducted a serious analysis of the factory's production situation, pointing out that the factory was currently at a turning point of breaking through difficulties and continuing to achieve great victories, but some cadres lacked confidence. In this situation, the Party Committee, based on the factory's production direction and the instructions of the provincial and municipal Party Committees, proposed taking all possible measures, overcoming difficulties, increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, and arming ourselves. Through such grasping of the situation, grasping of ideology, and grasping of the direction, the Party Committee's power to lead all factory workers to advance bravely was greatly enhanced, and the leadership level of the factory Party Committee stood higher and saw further.

The broad masses of cadres warmly welcomed this approach, believing that it was more effective than discussing monthly production plans. Of course, this does not mean that there is no need to discuss specific production issues at all; the Party Committee should still seriously study the arrangement of annual and quarterly production plans, the handling of major production cooperation tasks, and the determination of major new product trials, etc.

How to Form Resolutions?

Our factory Party Committee also strictly follows the principle that resolutions should not be formed hastily if the issues are not mature. In the past, we had lessons in this regard. When opinions were not consistent and the Party Committee intended to force a resolution, the following situations would occur: either some comrades would declare at the meeting that they reserved their opinions, or they would "criticize behind the back" after the meeting. Obviously, this is not conducive to the implementation of the Party's resolutions, to the exertion of the Party Committee's collective leadership role, or to the unity of the Party Committee's leadership core.

In order to be able to form resolutions smoothly, the Party Committee has now carried out some more serious activities.

First, on the basis of adhering to regular political theory study, we also systematically study the relevant instructions of higher authorities according to the issues discussed by the Party Committee. For example, when we studied how to improve the factory Party Committee's newspaper, "Struggle News," we seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions on newspaper work; when we studied the factory's technological revolution issue, we repeatedly studied the instructions of the provincial and municipal Party Committees and studied the technological revolution policies of the First Ministry of Machine Building. Because we studied the documents of higher authorities, our thinking was greatly inspired, our understanding was improved, and our views were unified in general, laying an ideological foundation for the correct formation of resolutions.

Second, we conducted in-depth investigation and research on some important issues. In the past two months, we have repeatedly analyzed and compared our factory's "Struggle News" with the newspapers of fraternal factories and mines; we have conducted in-depth inspections and visits to the apprentices' dormitories and canteens; and we have conducted systematic investigations and surveys of the ideological trends of cadres and the masses during the New Year's period. These investigations and research were not entrusted to one or two secretaries, but were completed by all the comrades of the Party Committee "going all out together." In this way, everyone's views and materials were roughly consistent, and resolutions were easily formed smoothly.

Third, the Party Committee also advocated that Party Committee members communicate and deliberate with each other. When we encounter problems, the Party Secretary and Deputy Secretary and the Factory Director generally communicate first, then separately communicate with other Party Committee members, and finally gather together to deliberate. After doing this, news is exchanged, views are exchanged, so that Party Committee members are ideologically prepared and the formation of resolutions does not come suddenly.

For some particularly important issues, it is not enough to only deliberate among Party Committee members; it is also necessary to convene preparatory meetings and invite relevant cadres from workshops and departments to consult widely. In individual cases, it is also necessary to hold airing views meetings to prepare for Party Committee meetings. For example, a big-character poster by old carpenter Hang Bingshan, airing views and criticisms at the Party member congress, and the active suggestions of middle-level cadre meetings enabled our factory Party Committee to see more accurately the factory's production situation in the first quarter, and we were able to propose concrete policies for changing thinking and overcoming difficulties, thereby immediately mobilizing the broad masses of factory workers.

Some people may think that our approach is too slow? Indeed, the Party Committee's meetings and activities must be more concise, this is one aspect; but more importantly, we are superficially slower, but in reality, when a correct and mature resolution is formed, the progress of the work will be very fast.

How to Ensure that Party Committee Decisions are Implemented by All?

The factory Party Committee making a relatively correct or completely correct resolution is only the beginning of the whole thing. Whether the resolution can quickly become the action of the masses and be fully realized depends on whether all parties seriously implement it.

To ensure that all aspects implement conscientiously, according to our experience, first of all, the Party Committee's resolution itself must have a relatively mature ideological foundation, relying on the Party Committee's members high sense of responsibility and awareness of the Party Committee resolution. The principle of our factory Party Committee, which is to prepare fully, deliberate maturely, and then form resolutions, plays a very important role in improving the sense of responsibility and awareness of the Party Committee members. Because we pay attention to doing this, the Party Committee members feel more deeply that the Party Committee's resolution is neither a formality of routine, nor the product of someone’s heavy rain, but a concentration of everyone's opinions and becomes something that everyone must be responsible for together. Therefore, after the meeting, they immediately go to their respective posts and actively start action. In March of this year, our factory had two tasks among the "six guarantees," that is, it had to produce both vehicles and rolling mills. At that time, some comrades emphasized that vehicle production was the factory's official task and placed rolling mill production in a subordinate position, violating the requirement of "priority for urgent and important tasks" in the "whole country as one chessboard." The factory Party Committee adopted a cautious and serious attitude towards this issue. After full communication, it made a clear resolution that the rolling mill should take the lead and drive the high production of vehicles. After the meeting, the responsible cadres from all aspects, as members of the Party Committee, quickly went to implement it separately, organized a new high tide of production, and achieved a major victory.

Secondly, the main members of the Party Committee, taking the lead in implementing the Party Committee's resolutions in an exemplary manner, is also a force that better promotes "implementation by all parties." After the Party Committee of our factory formally forms a resolution, the main members of the Party Committee can generally take the lead in implementing the Party Committee's resolution, which greatly influences and drives other members of the Party Committee, as well as cadres at all levels, to actively organize the realization of the Party Committee's resolution. For example, in April and May of this year, the factory Party Committee strengthened its leadership over grain work and canteens, and conducted extensive education on saving grain among the workers. In order to share weal and woe with the masses, and in order to discover and solve problems in a timely manner, the Party Committee made a resolution that all members of the Party Committee should go to the canteen and eat with the masses. The main members of the Party Committee went down, and other members naturally went down as well. And under the impetus of this action, the vast majority of Party member middle-level cadres and members of various Party branches also went to the canteen and ate with the workers. This approach is truly an amazing force. Many workers said, the Party Secretary and the Factory Director eat the same food as us, what else can we say?

Implementation by all parties does not mean that the matter is over, because some are done better and some are done worse. This also requires the Party Committee to organize timely inspections, especially using on-site meetings to exchange and promote good experiences and promote all aspects to better implement the Party Committee's resolutions. After the factory Party Committee made and communicated the resolution to carry out education on saving grain in April of this year, it immediately divided the area of responsibility, went deep into the workshops, and helped and checked the work. When we found that the Party branch of the refrigerator workshop was quick and powerful in implementing the Party Committee's resolution and acted overnight, we promptly convened an on-site meeting the next morning to exchange their experiences, which strengthened the atmosphere of the movement and promoted backward units and departments to catch up.

    怎样贯彻集体领导？
    中共武昌车辆厂委员会写作小组
    健全的集体领导，是坚强的统一领导的前提和基础。我们工厂党委对于进一步发挥集体领导的作用，作过一些尝试和努力。
    首先，我们坚持开好党委全体会议或者常委会议，废除了党、政、工、团碰头会。因为党、政、工、团碰头会，实际上是“一揽子”会，而且事无巨细，都要拿到会上讨论，因此，不论是由厂长主持的也好，或者由党委书记主持的也好，既然要决定许多问题，那就削弱了党委的集体领导。加以这种碰头会常常是兵来将挡，水来土掩，草草解决问题，也就不可能达到应有的思想水平。
    其次，我们把干部会和党委会议严格分开，并且少开党委扩大会议，多开党委全体会议。干部会议是可以召开的，问题在于不应该用它来代替党委会议作出决议。为了集思广益，召开少数的党委扩大会议，也是完全应该的；但是如果经常扩大开会，出席人员过多，党委成员得不到充分发言的机会，就会削弱集体领导的责任感，因而也是不利的。
    对于党委起草的文件，我们坚持采用党委开会讨论的办法，而不采用个别传阅、签署意见的方式。因为签署的意见不经过讨论比较，就不可能“灯火越拨越明，道理越讲越清”。何况有时签署的意见不同，无法做结论。如果由起草部门或者党委书记做出决定，那就破坏了党委的集体领导。
    为了更好地集中集体智慧和集体经验，我们党委坚持了有领导地提出问题进行讨论的办法。过去在党委会议上讨论问题时，往往是有关的同志做了中心发言，就大家讨论一番，然后由党委书记做总结发言，当作会议的决定。这样做，即便中心发言比较有准备，但是讨论起来，仍然漫无边际，最后的结论也就很难代表和集中大家的意见，势必变成倾盆大雨，生硬收场。近来，我们做了进一步的尝试，在中心发言之后，提出几个关键性的问题，集中展开讨论，最后根据大家的意见，作出概括的结论。很显然，这种结论，就不是党委书记一个人的设想，而是党委全体成员的集体创造了。
    应该抓些什么？
    讨论什么？
    党委应该领导工厂的一切，但是并不等于什么都要抓，什么都要讨论。
    过去我们工厂每个月的生产作业计划，差不多都要提交党委会议进行讨论。因为生产问题繁琐无比，于是党委每月的四次会议，就几乎全部花在日常生产的讨论中。近来的实践表明，像这一类的问题，完全可以由有关方面去讨论处理，以便让党委腾出手来，去研究和掌握更为重要的问题。
    工厂党委主要应该抓什么，讨论什么呢？我们的体会是：着重抓形势、抓思想、抓方针，就会收到更大的效果。比如今年1月份，我们党委就曾经对工厂的生产形势，进行了认真分析，指出工厂当前正处在突破困难继续大胜利的转变关头，而个别干部有些信心不足。在这种情况下，党委根据工厂生产方针和省、市委指示精神，提出采取千方百计、战胜困难、开源节流、武装自己的做法。经过这样的抓形势、抓思想、抓方针，就大大地增强了党委率领全厂职工奋勇前进的力量，使工厂党委的领导水平站得更高，看得更远。
    广大干部热烈欢迎这种做法，认为比讨论月度作业计划更有作用。当然，这并不意味着完全不需要讨论具体的生产问题；对于安排年度和季度的生产计划，对于处理重大的生产协作任务，对于确定重大的新产品试制等等，党委还是要认真研究的。
          怎样形成决议？
    我们工厂党委还严格遵循这样一条原则，就是问题不成熟，不急于形成决议。过去，我们在这方面曾经有过教训。当意见还不一致，党委打算勉强形成决议的时候，就会出现这样一些情况：或者有的同志在会上声明保留意见，或者会后“媳妇一面锣，私下说婆婆”。显然，这既不利于党的决议的贯彻执行，不利于党委集体领导作用的发挥，也不利于党委领导核心的团结。
    为了能够顺利地形成决议，现在党委进行了一些比较认真的活动。
    首先，我们在坚持经常的政治理论学习的基础上，还根据党委讨论的问题，有计划地学习上级的有关指示。例如，当我们研究改进工厂党委的机关报——“战斗报”的时候，我们就认真地学习了毛主席对报纸工作的指示；当我们研究工厂技术革命问题的时候，我们就反复学习了省、市委的指示，研究了第一机械工业部的技术革命方针。由于我们学习了上级的文件，所以大大地启发了思想，提高了认识，并且从总的方面统一了看法，为正确地形成决议打下了思想基础。
    其次，我们对一些重要问题，进行了深入的调查研究。最近两个月来，我们就曾经对本厂的“战斗报”和兄弟厂矿的报纸，进行过反复的分析和比较；对徒工的宿舍和食堂，进行过深入的考察和访问；对新旧年关的干部、群众思想动态，进行过系统的调查和摸底。这些调查研究不是委托一两个秘书去进行的，而是党委全体同志“杨家将，一齐上”，共同动手来完成的。这样一来，大家的观点和材料就大体趋于一致，决议也就容易顺利形成。
    再次，党委还提倡党委成员之间交谈酝酿。我们遇有问题，一般都是由正副书记和厂长首先交谈，接着分头和其他党委成员交谈，最后又集中起来进行酝酿。这样做以后，就互通了消息，交流了观点，使党委成员在思想上有所准备，在决议的形成上不致来得突然。
    对于一些特别重大的问题，仅仅在党委成员中进行酝酿还是不够的，还必须召开预备会议，邀请车间科室的有关干部，广泛地进行商量。在个别情况下，也还要举行鸣放大会，来为党委会议作好准备。例如，老木工杭炳山的一张大字报，党员大会上的鸣放、批评，中层干部会议的积极建议，就使我们工厂党委比较准确地看清楚了工厂第一季度的生产形势，就能够提出转变思想、战胜困难的具体方针，从而立即把全厂职工广泛地调动了起来。
    我们这样做，也许有人会以为进度太慢了吧？的确，党委的会议和活动还必须精悍一点，这是一方面；但是更主要的一方面，我们表面上慢了一些，实际上当形成正确的成熟的决议以后，工作的进展就会很快。
  怎样做到党委决定，
        各方去办？
    工厂党委做出一个比较正确或者完全正确的决议，仅仅是整个事情的开始，决议能不能迅速成为群众的行动，把它完全实现起来，关键还在于是不是做到各方认真去办了。
    要想做到各方面认真去办，根据我们的体会，首先要求党委的决议本身必须具有比较成熟的思想基础，依靠党委全体成员对于党委决议的高度的责任感和自觉性。我们工厂党委所掌握的一条准备充分、酝酿成熟、然后形成决议的原则，对提高党委成员的责任感和自觉性方面，是很起作用的。由于我们注意了这样做，所以党委委员们就比较深刻地感觉到，党委的决议既不是例行公事的形式，又不是哪一个人的倾盆大雨的产物，而是集中了大家的意见，成为大家共同要负责的东西。因此，会后立即各就各位，积极开始行动。今年3月份，我们工厂有着“六保户”中的两项任务，即是既要生产车辆，又要生产轧钢机。当时有些同志强调车辆生产是工厂的正式任务，而把轧钢机生产摆在从属位置，违反了“全国一盘棋”当中的“重重急急”的要求。工厂党委对于这个问题采取了慎重严肃的态度，经过充分交谈，作出轧钢机挂帅、带动出车高产的明确决议。会后，作为党委委员的各方面负责干部，就都很快地去分头贯彻执行，组织了生产新高潮，取得了重大的胜利。
    其次，党委的主要成员，模范地带头执行党委的决议，也是更好地推动“各方去办”的一股力量。我们工厂党委在正式形成决议后，党委的主要成员，一般都能够带头执行党委的决议，这就大大地影响和带动党委其他成员，以及各方面各级干部积极地去组织实现党委的决议。比如在今年4、5月份时，工厂党委加强了对粮食工作和食堂的领导，并在职工中进行广泛的节约粮食的教育。为了和群众同甘共苦，为了便于及时发现和解决问题，党委作出了党委全体成员下食堂和群众同吃的决议。党委主要成员下去了，其他成员自然更下去了。并且在这个行动的推动下，绝大部分的党员中层干部和各个党支部的委员们，也都下食堂和职工同吃了。这种做法真是一股了不起的大力量。许多工人说，党委书记、厂长都和我们同吃一样的饭菜，我们还有啥话可说呢。
    各方去办了，也还不等于事情已经结束，因为有些办得好些，有些办得差些，这就还要依靠党委组织及时的检查，特别是运用现场会议来交流推广好的经验，推动各方面去更好地贯彻执行党委的决议。我们工厂党委在今年4月做出并传达进行节约粮食教育的决议后，立刻就分片包干，深入车间，帮助和检查工作，当我们发现冰箱车间党支部在贯彻执行党委决议时迅速有力，连夜行动的情况，第二天早上就及时召开现场会议，交流了他们的经验，这就加强了运动的气氛，推动了落后的单位和部门迎头赶上。
