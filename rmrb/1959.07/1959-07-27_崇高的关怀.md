	One night, both of my children fell ill at the same time, vomiting and suffering diarrhea. Based on the symptoms, I suspected cholera. My wife and I took them to the emergency room of the Gansu Provincial People's Hospital. After registering, the doctor didn't arrive, and my wife became anxious. We waited for a while, and the doctor rushed in. He was a young man in his twenties. My wife said, "The children are so sick, and you were so slow to come. You are not responsible!" Thinking about it now, regardless of whether her opinion was correct or not, her attitude at the time was difficult to accept. But surprisingly, the doctor wasn't angry at all. Instead, he kindly explained, "Your opinion is very good. We will definitely improve in the future." He then proceeded to examine the children, diagnosing them with toxic indigestion. That night, there were many children in the emergency room. Immediately after, he examined the third one. Suddenly, a young man in white coat ran in and said, "Dr. Liu, the director said your dysentery hasn't healed yet. You can't work anymore. Please go back and rest. Dr. Song will come to replace you immediately." Only then did I suddenly realize that he was working while sick. His image suddenly became extraordinarily tall in my eyes. At the same time, I immediately felt that we had only seen that our children were sick, and had not thought that the doctor was forgetting about his own health to care for the children's health. At this moment, I heard him reply firmly, "No, so many children are sick, how can I leave here? Dr. Song already worked during the day, and now he's working at night. An older person can't take it." As a result, he continued to examine the children, one after another. On the way back from the hospital, my wife was very different from when the children had been sick in the past. She didn't mention the children's illness at all. But she mentioned Dr. Liu several times, saying, "I want to write a letter to apologize to him, but unfortunately I don't know his name." I said, "It doesn't matter if we don't know his name. We should learn from Dr. Liu in the future."
	My wife only joined the commercial work last year, working as a saleswoman. Since the launch of the increase production and practice economy campaign this year, everyone has been busy with production and work, and has no time to buy things. The store cares about consumers. In order to better serve customers, it was decided to strengthen mobile sales, delivering goods to factories, fields, neighborhoods, and offices. One day, she and a comrade went to the military region to sell goods. As soon as they finished selling and came out of the military region, they were met by a strong wind, with dust flying, dark clouds covering the sun, and thunder rumbling, getting closer and closer. It looked like it was about to rain heavily. The two of them were worried about what to do with the goods. Suddenly, a car sped up and stopped in front of them. It turned out that the responsible comrade of the military region had sent the car to take them back because of the bad weather. This caught them off guard. The two of them suggested, "Just send the goods back. We can walk back slowly." But the driver comrade disagreed, so they had to ride back in the car. The saleswoman's work received such great care from the responsible comrade of the military region, which moved her deeply and she often talked to me about it. It seemed that she gained strength in her work.
	These two things often linger in my mind. Although small, I can't forget them, because from here, I can imagine the relationship between people in our future society – lofty and selfless concern.

    崇高的关怀
    李天峰
    有天夜里，我的两个孩子一齐病了，吐泻不止，据症候，我疑心是霍乱。便和妻领到甘肃省人民医院门诊部去急诊。挂号之后，大夫不来，妻便有些着急。我们等了一会儿，大夫急急忙忙的进来了，是一个二十多岁的青年人。妻说：“孩子病成这样，你们左等不来，右等不来，工作真不负责！”现在想来，不管意见正确与否，她当时的态度是很难令人接受的。但奇怪的是大夫一点也不生气，反而好意解释说：“你的意见很好，我们以后一定改正。”说着就给孩子诊病，是中毒性消化不良。这天夜里，急诊的孩子很多，紧接着，就看第三个。忽然一个穿白衣的青年小伙子跑进来说“刘大夫，院长说你痢疾还没有好，再不能工作了，请你回去休息，宋大夫马上就来换你。”我才恍然明白他是带病工作的。他的形象在我的眼前，忽然变得格外高大起来，同时也立刻感到了我们只看到自己的孩子有病，而没有想到大夫为了关怀孩子们的健康而忘却了自己的健康。这时，只听他斩钉截铁地回答说：“不行，这么多的孩子病着，我能离开这里吗？宋大夫白天才上了班，夜间又工作，年纪大的人受不了。”结果，他一个孩子接着一个孩子的又诊下去。在由医院回来的路上，妻和以往孩子有病的时候大不相同了。对孩子们的病，一字不提。却好几次的提起刘大夫，说：“我想写封信去给他道歉，但可惜不知道他叫什么名字。”我说：“不知道也没关系，以后我们好好向刘大夫学习就行。”
    妻是去年才参加商业工作，任售货员的。今年以来，由于增产节约运动的开展，大家都忙于生产和工作，没时间买东西。商店里关怀消费者，为了更好的为顾客服务，决定加强流动推销工作，送货到工厂，到田间，到里弄，到办公室。有一天，她和一个同志到军区去推销。刚推销毕由军区出来，迎面便是一阵大风，刮得尘土飞扬，乌云蔽日，雷声隆隆，由远而近，眼看就要下大雨了。两个人正着急商品怎么办？忽然一辆小汽车飞驰而来，停在他们的跟前。原来是军区负责同志，因为天气不好，派来送她们回去的车子。这倒使她们没了主意，两个人提议“把商品送回去就行，人可以慢慢走回去。”但司机同志不同意，只好坐着小汽车回来。售货员的工作，受到军区负责同志这么大的关怀，使她感动不已，经常向我谈起。好像工作中就增加了力量。
    这两件事，经常缠绕在我的心头，虽然小，但却始终忘不掉，因为我从这里，推想到了我们未来社会的人和人之间的关系——崇高无私的关怀。
