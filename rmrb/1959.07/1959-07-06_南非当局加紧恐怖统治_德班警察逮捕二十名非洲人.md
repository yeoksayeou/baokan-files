Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Durban: In Durban, South Africa, approximately one hundred and fifty police officers conducted a surprise search and arrest operation on July 3rd in the African residential area of Cato Manor. A total of twenty Africans were arrested, and 20,000 gallons of alcohol were destroyed. Cato Manor was the site of the last major demonstration against racial discrimination.

This police action, taken based on the decision of the Durban Municipal Council and the Durban Police Authority, is aimed at intensifying the prohibition of African women in the area from brewing their own beer, thereby cutting off their livelihood and driving them to African "reserves." The South African authorities' ban on Africans brewing their own beer is also intended to force Africans to drink in municipal beer halls, in order to further exploit them, as the prices of beer in municipal halls are particularly expensive.

    南非当局加紧恐怖统治
    德班警察逮捕二十名非洲人
    新华社4日讯　德班消息：在南非德班港，大约有一百五十名警察3日对非洲人居住的卡托马诺尔区进行突击搜捕。共逮捕了二十名非洲人，并且捣毁了二万加仑酒类。卡托马诺尔是上次爆发反抗种族歧视大示威的地方。
    这个根据德班市政委员会和德班警察当局的决定所采取的警察行动，是为了加紧禁止那个地区的非洲妇女自制啤酒，这样可以断绝她们的生计，把她们赶到非洲人“居留地”去。南非当局不让非洲人自制啤酒，也是为了迫使非洲人到市营啤酒店去喝，以便进一步剥削非洲人，因为市营的啤酒价格特别昂贵。
