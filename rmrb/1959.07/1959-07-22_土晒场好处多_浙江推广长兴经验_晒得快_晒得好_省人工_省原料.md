Earth Drying Grounds Offer Many Benefits
Zhejiang Promotes Changxing Experience
Quick and Good Drying, Saving Labor and Materials

    (Reported by this newspaper) In Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, flat earth drying grounds can be seen everywhere. There is an average of one mu of drying ground for every hundred mu of paddy field. Each drying ground can generally dry 10,000 to 20,000 jin of grain.
    Earth drying grounds have many benefits, enabling quick and good drying and reducing grain waste. Generally, each person can dry 5,000 jin of grain per day, and it also saves raw materials and production costs. Local people have calculated that a bamboo mat requires 200 jin of moso bamboo and costs 15 yuan; while making one mu of earth drying ground requires only 16 workdays, and the amount of grain dried can be equivalent to 50 bamboo mats, greatly reducing costs. The method is also very simple, and it can be used comprehensively for both drying grain and threshing, and vegetables and other crops can be planted when not in use. Therefore, local people are happy to use this kind of drying ground.
    The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Implement Reform Office held an on-site meeting in Changxing and decided to promote it throughout the province.

    土晒场好处多
    浙江推广长兴经验
    晒得快　晒得好  省人工　省原料
    本报讯　在浙江长兴县，人们到处都可见到平整的土晒场。平均一百亩水田就有一亩晒场。每个晒场一般可晒谷一、二万斤。
    土晒场的好处很多，能够晒得快、晒得好，减少稻谷浪费。一般每人每天能晒谷五千斤，还能节省原料和生产成本。当地群众算了一笔账：一张竹簟需用二百斤毛竹，花费十五元；而做一亩地面积的土晒场只需十六个工，晒谷数量可抵上五十张竹簟，费用大大降低。做法也很简单，而且可以综合利用，既能晒谷，又可利用场地脱粒，不用时可以种植蔬菜和其他作物。因而，当地群众都乐意采用这种晒场。
    浙江省农具改革办公室在长兴召开现场会议，决定全省推广。
