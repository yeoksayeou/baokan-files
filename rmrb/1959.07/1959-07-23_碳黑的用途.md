Uses of Carbon Black

　　Carbon black is extracted from natural gas. It has a wide range of uses: In the rubber industry, carbon black is used to manufacture automobile tires, power transmission belts, high-pressure rubber hoses, rubber shoes, sneakers, etc. If calculated by weight, carbon black accounts for about 40% of each automobile tire. Hard rubber tools used in mechanical drilling and various instruments rely on carbon black as a raw material to increase their strength. In the paint and printing industries, high-grade paints, printing inks for books and newspapers, and carbon paper all use carbon black as a raw material. In electrical engineering, carbon black is used to manufacture arcs, battery casings, carbon brush vacuum tube headphones, etc. In the paper industry, carbon black is used to manufacture thick cardboard, wrapping paper, etc. In the chemical industry, carbon black can be used as various pigments for dyeing fabrics and plastics. Even the chocolate we eat every day contains carbon black.

    碳黑的用途
    碳黑是从天然气中提炼出来的。它的用途广泛：在橡胶工业中，制造汽车轮胎、动力传动胶带、高压橡皮管线和胶鞋、球鞋等产品都要用碳黑，如果以重量计算每个汽车轮胎约有40％是碳黑作原料。机械钻探使用的硬度橡胶工具和各种仪表增加强度都离不开碳黑作原料；在油漆印刷工业中，高级油漆、印刷书报的油墨和复写纸等都用碳黑作原料；在电工方面，制造电弧、蓄电池壳、电刷真空管耳机等要用碳黑；在造纸工业上，制造厚纸板、包装纸等都要用碳黑。在 化学工业上，碳黑可作塑料染布的各种颜料。人们日常吃的巧克力糖，里面也含有碳黑成份。
