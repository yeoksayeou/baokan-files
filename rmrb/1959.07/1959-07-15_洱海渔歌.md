    Erhai Fishing Song
    Bai Nationality, Na Jialun
    Crisp singing, drifting gently on the night breeze...
    A fishing girl, singing as she carefully mends a fishing net.
    Suddenly, the singing stopped, as if cut off with scissors. That unpleasant thought appeared in her mind again. She stared at the fishing lights in front of her, lost in thought for a moment, then bit her lip and said resolutely, "Hmph, we'll see who gives in first!"
    Her sweetheart, Hai栓, is a well-known middle school student in the commune who can write and draw. The commune wants to cultivate him and has decided to send him to the provincial agricultural college. But the commune leader gave him a task: before he leaves, he must complete the "Long-Term Plan Diagram" that he has been researching, so that it can be hung in the meeting place on the day of the commune members' meeting, so that everyone can see a future as bright as Erhai Lake.
    Who knew that Hai栓, upon hearing he was going to school, was so happy that he didn't even sleep, focusing solely on reviewing his lessons day and night—the young man was afraid of falling behind in school and embarrassing the commune! He actually forgot about the important matter of drawing the diagram!
    On the day of the meeting, the fishing girl angrily searched for Hai栓 with her eyes. He was huddled in a corner of the meeting place, head buried, not daring to look her in the eye.
    In a fit of anger, the fishing girl went home before the meeting ended and wrote a big-character poster, saying that Hai栓 "only cares about himself, not the commune!" She posted the big-character poster at the entrance of the meeting place. After the meeting adjourned, the area was packed with people. After reading it, everyone laughed and said, "This is a little couple rectifying each other!"
    It's been a week since then, and neither of them has paid attention to the other. If they happen to meet, Hai栓 blushes and lowers his head, while the fishing girl pouts, twists her neck, and storms past, each going their own way. But she just heard that Hai栓 is leaving tomorrow...
    "If he really leaves like this and never talks to me again..." she didn't dare to think further.
    "Go find him, talk it over clearly..."
    She stood up, hesitated for a moment, then sat down again: "No, it's not my fault!"
    Crisp singing, drifting gently on the night breeze...
    The singing stopped again. She heard the familiar footsteps, gradually, gradually approaching her. Although the sound was so light, she could hear every step clearly.
    She felt that he was already standing behind her! Her heart started beating faster, her hands started trembling, her face burned like fire!
      With a "whoosh" sound, a beautiful picture fell from his hand and unfolded before her: Ah, the high Cang Mountain, with white clouds like silk ribbons wrapped around it! Erhai Lake, how vast! What is this? That's right, bright houses, wide roads! Oh, hospitals, clubs, department stores... Hey, why are there no camellias? Like the kind he gave her that time!
    She unconsciously blurted out: "You should draw a few camellias."
    "What?" he didn't hear clearly.
    Her face flushed red with embarrassment, and she quickly explained: "I said, quickly hand it over to the commune leader."
    "The commune leader said, let me give it to you..."
    "Why?"
    "He said, let you hand it over to him..."
    "Why!"
    "The commune leader said, he, he's willing to be a peacemaker, to, to connect this, this broken thread!" His voice was even lower.
    She felt that he had already sat down, sitting close beside her. She covered her hot, flushed face with her hands, leaned back, and fell onto his broad, warm chest.
    Crisp singing, drifting gently on the night breeze...

    洱海渔歌
    白族　那家伦
    清脆的歌声，随着夜风轻轻地飘……
    渔妹一边唱着歌，一边在细心地织补一张鱼网。
    突然，歌声断了，像用剪刀剪断了一样。那个不愉快的念头，又出现在她心上。她望着面前的渔火，出了一会神，咬了咬嘴唇，坚决地说：“哼，看哪个先理哪个！”
    她的心上人海栓，是社里出名的能写会画的初中生。社里想培养他，决定送他进省里的农业专科学校。但社长给了他一个任务，让他在走以前，把早已研究好的“远景规划图”画出来，好在开社员大会那天，挂在会场上，让大家看看像洱海一样亮堂的未来。
    那晓得，海栓听说进学校，高兴的连觉也不睡，只顾整日整夜地复习功课——小伙子怕到学校里跟不上，给社里丢人呀！画图这件大事，他竟然忘了！
    开会那天，渔妹愤愤地用眼睛找寻海栓，他缩在会场的角落里，埋着头，不敢正眼望她一下。
    渔妹一气之下，没散会就奔回家去，写了一张大字报，说海栓“只关心自己，不关心公社！”她把大字报贴在会场门口。散会后，那里挤得水泄不通，大家看罢，还笑着说：“这是俩小口子整风！”
    从那时起，已经一个星期了，他们谁都没理过谁。要是碰在一起，海栓就红着脸，低着头，渔妹噘起小嘴，一扭脖子，闯过去，各走各的。可是，她刚才听说，海栓明天要走了……。
    “要是他真就这样走了，一辈子也不理我……”她不敢想下去。
  “去找找他吧，谈谈清楚……”
    她站起来了，犹豫了一会，又坐下去：“不，又不是我的错！”
    清脆的歌声，随着夜风轻轻地飘……
    歌声，又断了。她听见那熟悉的脚步声，渐渐地、渐渐地向她走来。虽然这声音是那样轻，可是每一步她都听得清楚。
    她感觉，他已经站在背后了！她的心跳得快起来，她的手变得抖起来，她的脸像火一样烧起来！
      “唰”一声响，一幅美丽的图画，从他手里落下来，展现在她眼前：啊，高高的苍山，还有白云像绸带似的绕着它呢！洱海，多么宽大呀！这是什么，对，亮堂的房屋，宽宽的公路！哟，医院，俱乐部，百货店……哎，怎么没有山茶花？就像那次他送她的那种！
    她不自觉的脱口说出：“应该画上几枝山茶花。”
    “什么？”他没听清。
    她惊红了脸，急忙申辩：“我说，快去交给社长。”
    “社长说，让我交给你……”
    “为哪样？”
    “他说，由你去交给他……”
    “为哪样嘛！”
    “社长说，他，他愿当个和事佬，把，把这根，断了的线，接起来！”声音越更低了。
    她感觉，他已经坐下来了，紧挨着她坐下来了，她用手捂着羞得火热的脸，朝后一靠，倒在他那宽大而温暖的胸膛上。
    清脆的歌声，随着夜风轻轻地飘……
