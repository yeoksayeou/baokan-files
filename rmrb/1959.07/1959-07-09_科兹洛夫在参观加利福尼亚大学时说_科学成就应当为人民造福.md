Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: According to TASS, Kozlov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and his entourage visited the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California in Berkeley on the 6th.

University of California President Kerr warmly welcomed Kozlov. Dr. McMillan, Director of the Radiation Laboratory, invited Kozlov to visit the largest synchrocyclotron in the United States. During the visit, Kozlov said, "This device reminds me of our device in Dubna. I think our synchrocyclotron is a bit larger."

Dr. McMillan agreed. He said, "The capacity of our device in Berkeley is 6.2 billion electron volts, while your device in Dubna is 10 billion electron volts." Dr. McMillan continued that American scientists have begun to build a new 30 billion electron volt synchrocyclotron in Brookhaven. Kozlov recalled that the Soviet government had decided to build a device with a capacity of 50 billion electron volts.

Kozlov said, "Such competition in the peaceful use of atomic energy should only be welcomed; it is a very beneficial thing."

University President Kerr hosted a banquet for Kozlov, thanking Kozlov for visiting the university and saying that this kind of contact is conducive to world peace.

In his reply, Kozlov emphasized that scientists from the Soviet Union and the United States must expand contact. He said, we believe that the discoveries of human genius, including achievements in atomic energy, should be used to benefit the people of all countries and serve the interests of peace. We advocate that atomic energy provide electricity for urban and rural areas and power merchant ships. By the way, these ships will be able to transport goods quickly between Vladivostok and San Francisco. We call for friendship and peace between our two peoples. If our two peoples establish friendship, war will be impossible.

Regarding his impressions of the United States, Kozlov said, I see that the American people treat the Soviet people very well, and the American people do not want war. The task is to satisfy this desire of the people of all countries. We should strive to resolve disputes through peaceful means, bring our positions closer, and fight to defend peace. I believe that our visit conducted with this view is beneficial.

On the evening of the 6th, Kozlov and his entourage arrived in Detroit by plane.

    科兹洛夫在参观加利福尼亚大学时说
    科学成就应当为人民造福
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席科兹洛夫和随行人员6日在柏克莱参观了加利福尼亚大学的放射性实验室。
    加利福尼亚大学校长克尔热烈欢迎科兹洛夫。放射性实验室主任麦克米伦博士邀请科兹洛夫参观美国最大的同步稳相加速器。科兹洛夫在参观时说：“这个装置使我想起我们在杜布诺的装置。我认为，我们的同步稳相加速器更大一些。”
    麦克米伦博士同意这一点。他说，“我们在柏克莱的装置的能力是六十二亿电子伏特，而你们在杜布诺的装置是一百亿电子伏特。”麦克米伦博士接着说，目前美国科学家已在布鲁海温开始建造一个三百亿电子伏特的新的同步稳相加速器。科兹洛夫追述说，苏联政府决定建造一个能力为五百亿电子伏特的装置。
    科兹洛夫说，“在和平使用原子能方面的这种竞赛只应受到欢迎，这是一件大有益处的事。”
    大学校长克尔设宴招待科兹洛夫，他感谢科兹洛夫前来参观这所大学，并且说，这种接触有利于世界和平。
    科兹洛夫在致答词中着重指出，苏美两国科学界人士必须扩大接触。他说，我们认为，人类天才的发现，其中包括原子能方面的成就应当用来为各国人民造福，为和平的利益服务。我们主张，原子能为城乡供电，开动商船。顺便提一下，这些船只将能载运货物迅速地往返于海参崴和旧金山之间。我们呼吁争取我们两国人民之间的友好和和平。如果我们两国人民建立起友谊，战争就不可能发生。
    科兹洛夫谈到他对美国的观感说，我看到美国人民对待苏联人民很好，美国人民不希望战争。任务在于，满足各国人民的这种意愿。我们应当争取通过和平手段来解决争端，使我们的立场接近和为保卫和平而奋斗。我认为，我们以这种观点进行的访问是有益的。
    6日晚上，科兹洛夫和随行人员乘飞机抵达底特律。
