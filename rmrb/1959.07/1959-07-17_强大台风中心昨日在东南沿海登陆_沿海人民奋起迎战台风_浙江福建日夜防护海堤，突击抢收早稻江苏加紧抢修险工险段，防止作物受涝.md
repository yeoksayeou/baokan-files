Xinhua News Agency, July 16th: The Central Meteorological Science Research Institute issued a typhoon message at 12:00 noon today:

The typhoon over the East China Sea was approaching the coast between Wenzhou, Zhejiang, and Fuding, Fujian, at 8:00 am today. It is expected that within the next 24 hours, the typhoon will make landfall in this area and then turn in a northerly direction, rapidly weakening. On the morning of July 17th, the typhoon will re-enter the sea from central Jiangsu and transform into a temperate cyclone, moving northeastward via central Korea towards the Sea of Japan within 48 hours. In the next 36 hours, winds in the northern East China Sea and nearby coastal areas will weaken from Force 8-11 to Force 6-8. Winds in northeastern Zhejiang, southern and central Jiangsu, the central and southern Yellow Sea, and southeastern coastal areas of Shandong will increase to Force 7-9. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, northeastern Fujian, southeastern Anhui, and the Shandong Peninsula will experience heavy rain.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 16th: The center of a powerful typhoon made landfall at 11:00 am today in Pingyang County on the southeastern coast of Zhejiang. At that time, the maximum wind force at the typhoon center was above Force 12. After the typhoon made landfall, the wind force gradually weakened, and by the afternoon, it had decreased to below Force 10. At 4:00 pm, the typhoon center passed through the suburbs of Wenzhou City and reached Qingtian County, moving northward. From 8:00 am to 4:00 pm today, the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang experienced heavy rain, with rainfall ranging from 30 to 50 millimeters. Pingyang County, where the typhoon center made landfall, received 115.5 millimeters of rainfall within six hours.

The people of Zhejiang Province, with their rich experience in fighting typhoons, had fully prepared for typhoon prevention and resistance work before this powerful typhoon made landfall. Coastal areas such as Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Zhoushan mobilized the entire party and all the people from midnight on the 14th to bravely fight against the typhoon. On the 15th and 16th, these areas mobilized over three million people to harvest early rice day and night. According to incomplete statistics, over 500,000 mu of early rice have been harvested and brought home.

Fishermen who were fishing on the coastal waters returned to port to take shelter from the wind after receiving the typhoon warning.

Before the typhoon struck, assault teams and rescue teams were widely deployed along the 1,000-mile-long sea wall in coastal eastern Zhejiang, patrolling and guarding day and night, inspecting and repairing in the rain.

In the battle against the typhoon, party and government leaders at all levels in Zhejiang Province personally went to the front lines, inspected dangerous works, directed operations, and led and participated in the harvesting of early rice. Now, the people of Zhejiang Province are continuing to fight against the typhoon, urgently washing and supporting seedlings, and repairing water conservancy projects.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 16th: Coastal areas of Fujian Province have been affected by the strong typhoon, experiencing winds from Force 4 to Force 11. In the coastal areas north of Huangqi Peninsula in Lianjiang County, near where the typhoon center made landfall, the wind force generally reached Force 9 to Force 10, with a maximum of Force 11; between Huangqi Peninsula and Pingtan Island, the wind force reached Force 7 to Force 8; between Pingtan Island and Chongwu Peninsula in Huian County, the wind force was Force 5 to Force 6, with a maximum of Force 7; and in Jinjiang, Longxi, and other areas south of Chongwu Peninsula, the wind force was generally Force 4 to Force 5. Most areas also experienced showers and heavy rain.

To overcome the attacks of the typhoon and heavy rain, party, government, military, and civilians in coastal areas made preparations in advance. Starting on the morning of the 15th, various localities mobilized all forces to crash harvest, notified outbound ships to return to port, moved small boats ashore, and directed large ships to safe areas to take shelter from the wind; at the same time, they strengthened the protection and patrol work of reservoirs, ponds, and seawall water conservancy projects. Fuding and Xiapu counties, which were close to the typhoon center, mobilized more than 100,000 people to crash harvest and rescue efforts before the typhoon arrived, timely harvesting more than 10,000 mu of ripe early rice.

Currently, party, government, military, and civilians in relevant areas of Fujian are closely guarding against possible heavy rain brought by the typhoon.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 16th: Various coastal areas in Jiangsu are urgently deploying typhoon and flood prevention work. The broad masses of cadres and the people are actively preparing for the attack of typhoons and heavy rain.

The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee issued an emergency notice on typhoon defense on the afternoon of the 15th, and inspected and deployed typhoon and flood prevention work in various localities. The Nantong Special District along the coast made urgent arrangements for the protection of tall-stem crops and the repair of dangerous sections of the seawall, and notified fishing boats and transport ships at sea to immediately return to port. After hearing the typhoon warning, the fishing brigades in Qidong County designated special personnel to listen to typhoon news and transmit typhoon warnings. The fishing brigades in all six ports of the county comprehensively inspected the fishing boats and reinforced the anchors and cables. The fishing boats in the Lvsi fishing ground had mostly returned to port by the afternoon of the 15th.

The Suzhou Special District, where early rice has generally headed, decided that in addition to strengthening typhoon and flood prevention preparations along Taihu Lake, it would also immediately take measures to prevent early rice lodging. On the afternoon of the 15th, counties such as Wujiang, Kunshan, Wuxian, and Taicang experienced more rainfall. To ensure that rice paddies and cotton fields in low-lying areas are not flooded, cadres and the masses in waterlogged areas are braving the rain to drain accumulated water and preparing for the battle against the typhoon.

Cities such as Nanjing and Wuxi also deployed typhoon and flood prevention preparations overnight on the 15th.

    新华社16日讯　今日中午十二时，中央气象科学研究所发布台风消息：
    东海上的台风今天上午八时已在浙江温州到福建福鼎之间靠近海岸。预计未来二十四小时内，台风在这一带地区登陆之后将转向偏北方向移动，并将迅速减弱。17日上午，台风将从江苏中部重新出海，并转变为温带气旋，四十八小时内将向东北方经朝鲜中部移向日本海。未来三十六小时内，东海北部海面及附近沿海风力将由八级到十一级减弱为六级到八级，浙江东北部、江苏南部和中部、黄海中部、南部及山东东南部沿海风力将加大到七级到九级，江苏、浙江、福建东北部、安徽东南部、山东半岛将有暴雨。
    新华社杭州16日电　强大台风中心今天上午十一时在浙江东南沿海平阳县登陆。当时台风中心最大风力在十二级以上，台风登陆后风力逐渐减弱，下午风力已减到十级以下。下午四时，台风中心经过温州市郊到达青田县，正向北移动。今天上午八时到下午四时，浙江东海沿海下了暴雨，降雨量三十到五十毫米，台风中心登陆的平阳县，六小时内降雨量达到了一百一十五·五毫米。
    有着同台风斗争丰富经验的浙江省人民，在这次强大台风登陆之前，就充分作好防台抗台准备工作。沿海的温州、宁波、舟山等地区，14日半夜起，就全党全民动员，奋起迎战台风。15、16两天，这些地区共有三百多万人日夜抢收早稻，据不完全统计，已有五十多万亩早稻抢收到家。
    正在沿海海面捕鱼的渔民，在接到台风警报后，即纷纷回港避风。
    在台风来袭前，浙东沿海长达一千多里海堤上，普遍散布着突击队，抢险队，日夜巡逻守护，冒雨检查抢修。
    在和台风决战中，浙江省各级党政领导干部亲临前线，检查险工，指挥作战，领导和参加抢收早稻。现在浙江省人民正在继续同台风作斗争，突击洗苗、扶苗，抢修水利工程。
    新华社福州16日电　福建省沿海地区因为遭受强台风的影响，先后受到四级以上到十一级大风的袭击。其中在台风中心登陆附近地区的连江县黄岐半岛以北沿海，风力一般达九级到十级，最大达十一级；黄岐半岛以南到平潭岛之间，风力达七级到八级；平潭岛到惠安县崇武半岛之间，风力五级到六级，最大七级；崇武半岛以南的晋江、龙溪等地区，风力一般四级到五级。大部地区还出现了阵雨和暴雨。
    为了战胜台风和暴雨的袭击，沿海地区的党政军民都在事先作了准备。从15日上午开始，各地就动员各方面力量突击抢收，通知出海船舶回港，把小船搬上岸，大船驶进安全地带避风；同时加强了对山塘、水库和海堤水利工程的防护和巡逻工作。接近台风中心的福鼎、霞浦两县，在台风来临前，出动了十万多人突击抢收抢险，及时收割了一万多亩黄熟的早稻。
    现在福建有关地区党政军民严密戒备可能因台风而来的暴雨袭击。
    新华社南京16日电　江苏沿海各地紧急部署防台防涝工作。广大干部和群众积极防备台风和暴雨的袭击。
    中共江苏省委在15日下午下达了关于防御台风的紧急通知，并且检查和部署了各地的防台防涝工作。沿海南通专区对高秆作物的防护、海堤险工险段的抢修工作，都作了紧急部署，并且通知出海的渔船和运输船立即回港靠岸。启东县的各个渔业大队听到台风警报后，都指定专人收听台风消息，传递台风警报。全县六个港口的渔业大队都全面检查了渔船，加固了锚缆。吕泗渔场的渔船，在15日下午已大部分回港。
    早稻已经普遍抽穗的苏州专区，决定除了加强太湖沿岸防台防涝准备工作以外，还立即采取措施，防止早稻倒伏。吴江、昆山、吴县、太仓等县15日下午降雨量较多，为了保证低洼地区的稻田棉田不受涝，积水地区的干部群众都在冒雨抢排积水，作好迎战台风的准备工作。
    南京、无锡等城市在15日也连夜部署了防台防涝准备工作。
