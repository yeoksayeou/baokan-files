    Oils and Fats are Important Raw Materials for Light Industry
    China's woody oil crops can be divided into two major categories: edible oil crops and industrial oil crops.
    In terms of edible oil crops, the South has oil tea, prickly ash, cashews, avocados, mountain loquat, etc., among which oil tea has the largest cultivated area and economic value. Camellia oil is an important edible oil for the broad masses in southern China, and can also be used as lamp oil, hair oil, petroleum jelly, printing paste oil, machine lubricating oil, and oil for making soap and candles. Oil tea fruit shells and oil tea cakes can be used to make tannin extract, activated carbon, pesticides, and fertilizers. In northern China, edible woody oil crops include walnuts, hazelnuts, etc.
    In terms of woody oil crops for industrial use, the most important are tung oil and Chinese tallow trees. Tung oil extracted from tung seeds is a very good drying vegetable oil with the characteristics of water resistance, heat resistance, acid resistance, alkali resistance, non-conductivity, and bright color. It is an important raw material for the paint industry. Tung oil is also used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, bakelite, artificial leather, artificial gasoline, waterproofing agents, and preservatives. According to statistics, there are currently 850 industries abroad that require tung oil, and nearly 200 in China. Tallow oil extracted from the fruit of the Chinese tallow tree is an important raw material for the soap industry. In addition, cassia oil and anise oil, produced by cinnamon trees and star anise trees that are abundant in Guangxi, southern Yunnan, are important raw materials for the fragrance and food industries. Turpentine oil and camphor oil are raw materials for the fuel industry and pharmaceuticals.

    油脂是重要的轻工业原料
    我国的木本油料，归纳起来可以分为食用油料和工业用油料两大类。
    在食用油料方面，南方有油茶、花椒、腰果、油梨、山枇杷等，其中栽培面积和经济价值最大的是油茶。茶油是我国南方广大群众的重要食用油，也可作灯油、润发油、凡士林、印泥油、机器润滑油和制肥皂、蜡烛用油等。油茶果壳和油茶饼可以制栲胶、活性炭、农药和肥料。北方地区食用木本油料有核桃、榛子等。
    在工业用的木本油料方面，较主要的是油桐和乌桕。油桐籽榨出的桐油是一种很好干性植物油，具有耐水、耐热、耐酸、耐碱，不传电，色泽光亮等特点，是油漆工业的重要原料。桐油在制人造橡胶、电木、人造皮革、人造汽油、防水剂、防腐剂也都有不少用处。据统计，目前需要桐油的工业在国外有八百五十种，在国内有近二百种。乌桕果实榨出的桕油是肥皂工业的重要原料。此外，盛产于我国两广、云南南部一带的肉桂树、八角树生产出的桂油和茴油，是芳香工业和食品工业的重要原料。松节油和樟脑油是燃料工业原料和医药用品。
