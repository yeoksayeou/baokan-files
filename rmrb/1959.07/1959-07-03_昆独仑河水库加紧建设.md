Currently, the 450-meter-long dam has been built 15 meters above the river surface; the water intake and body sections of the flood discharge tunnel have been completed and diversion has begun.

    昆独仑河水库加紧建设
    据新华社讯　在横跨包头钢铁工业基地的黄河支流——昆独仑河下游，一座水库正在紧张地建设。这座水库全部建成后，包头钢铁工业基地的生产和建设将免除洪水的威胁。
    这座水库是在去年12月27日正式动工兴建的。现在，全长四百五十公尺的拦河大坝已筑出河面十五公尺；泄洪洞的引水和洞身部分已经完工，开始导流。溢洪道的开挖工程也即将完成。
