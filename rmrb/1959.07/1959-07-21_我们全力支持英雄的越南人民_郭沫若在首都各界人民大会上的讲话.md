Xinhua News Agency, 20th - China Peace Committee Chairman Guo Moruo's speech at the people from all walks of life in the capital to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Geneva Agreement and support the peaceful reunification of Vietnam Congress. Dear Comrades, Friends:
    Today is the fifth anniversary of the restoration of peace in Indochina. In order to truly realize and consolidate the overall peace in the Indochina region, and to strive for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council has designated today as "Vietnam Day." We, the people from all walks of life in the capital, are holding a grand gathering here today to warmly respond to this call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council. We would like to express our warm and heartfelt congratulations and respect to the heroic Vietnamese people for the glorious achievements they have made in the cause of striving for national liberation and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.
    The Vietnamese people have waged a century of unyielding struggle against colonialism for national independence and freedom. After long and arduous years, the heroic Vietnamese people finally won the victory of the August Revolution, and on September 2, 1945, the independent and unified Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed. The French colonialists, like all colonialists, were unwilling to lose their colonies. They vainly attempted to restore their colonial rule over Vietnam and, with the support of American and British imperialism, launched a war of aggression to suppress the people of Indochina. The Vietnamese people and the people of the other two Indochinese countries heroically persisted in the nine-year national revolutionary war and strengthened their own forces in the struggle. The French colonialists, despite the strong support of US imperialism, ultimately suffered the disastrous defeat of the annihilation of their entire army in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu.
    The victory of the Vietnamese people forced French imperialism to reach an agreement at the Geneva Conference in 1954, restoring peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the Indochinese people, recognizing the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the Indochinese countries, and refraining from any interference in their internal affairs. These principles were also recognized by other participating countries. The Geneva Accords are a brilliant achievement of the long-term and resolute struggle of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos against colonialism. This victory was a powerful blow to the colonialists and a great encouragement to the broad masses of Asian and African people who were striving for national liberation. The victory of the Indochinese people is a common victory for the people of the world, and peace-loving people in all countries have sincerely cheered for the restoration of peace in Indochina.
    We all remember very clearly that before the Geneva Conference, the US imperialists, disregarding the peaceful aspirations of the people of Indochina and the people of the world, had been trying to delay and expand the Indochina war. In June 1950, US President Truman openly declared that he would accelerate military aid to the French aggressor troops in Indochina and send military missions to directly intervene in and direct the war of aggression. After the French aggressor troops suffered repeated and heavy defeats, just as the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference had already suggested convening the Geneva Conference to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina, the US government, in order to expand the Indochina war, openly sent US Air Force personnel to directly participate in the war to slaughter the people of the three Indochinese countries. The conclusion of the Geneva Accords shattered the criminal activities of US imperialism. However, US imperialism was not reconciled to its defeat. Just as the Geneva Conference ended, the representatives of the US government colluded with South Vietnam to openly refuse to sign the final declaration of the conference, unwilling to participate with other participating countries in the joint work of ensuring the restoration of peace in Indochina, so as to find an opportunity to undermine the Geneva Accords in the future. Sure enough, shortly after the signing of the Geneva Accords, the United States gathered Britain, France, and other vassal states to form the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), and adopted the method of unilaterally declaring military obligations to the three Indochinese countries, forcibly placing South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia under the "protection" of this group, in order to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Accords. After that, US imperialism carried out a series of blatant sabotage against the Geneva Accords. US imperialism had long harbored the ambition to squeeze out French imperialism and seize the entire Indochina. In order to realize this ambition, US imperialism first controlled South Vietnam. Later, it instigated the pro-American forces in Laos to unilaterally abandon the Geneva Accords; and for the Kingdom of Cambodia, it planned a series of military provocations and subversive activities. For five years, US imperialism has been actively cultivating the rule of its puppet in South Vietnam—Ngo Dinh Diem and the Ngo family, sending a large number of military personnel to unscrupulously transport large quantities of murderous weapons, and helping the Ngo Dinh Diem group to carry out large-scale massacres of the people of southern Vietnam. Now, South Vietnam has become a slaughterhouse for the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem group. In December last year, more than 1,000 Vietnamese patriots were brutally murdered in the "Phu Loi concentration camp" alone. In addition, the US aggressors also frequently create tension in the Indochina region, spread the atmosphere of war, carry out subversive activities, disrupt the peaceful lives of the people of the Indochinese countries, and threaten peace in Asia and the world. The crimes of US imperialism in undermining the Geneva Accords cannot be denied. These crimes are causing it to be increasingly strongly opposed by the people of Indochina and the world. The awakened people of Indochina will never allow the conspiracy of the United States to enslave the people of Indochina to succeed.
    For five years, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently and faithfully implemented the Geneva Accords, and has made unremitting efforts to maintain peace in Indochina and realize the reunification of the motherland. After the cessation of hostilities and the completion of the concentration and transfer of troops, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, has repeatedly made proposals requesting consultations between the North and South on the issue of general elections for reunification. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem group, under the instigation and support of the United States, blatantly rejected the reasonable proposals of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Because US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem group completely disregarded the ardent desire of the Vietnamese people to reunify their motherland and brutally undermined the Geneva Accords, Vietnam is still in a state of division today.
    The Vietnamese people are a unified nation with a long history and culture. The territory of Vietnam does not allow any artificial division. The reunification of Vietnam should be completed by the Vietnamese people themselves as soon as possible in accordance with the Geneva Accords. However, on the fifth anniversary of the Geneva Accords, the Vietnamese people are still enduring the pain of the division of their motherland and the separation of their families due to the interference of US imperialism. The strong desire of the Vietnamese people to reunify their motherland should be fully and rapidly satisfied. The Vietnamese people have long experience in fighting against colonialism. History proves that the people who have gained independence and liberation will never allow any colonialists to sit on their heads again. The firm will of the Vietnamese people to reunify their motherland cannot be stopped by any force. The US imperialists' barbarous obstruction of Vietnam's reunification and their attempt to occupy southern Vietnam for a long time will surely be thoroughly crushed by the Vietnamese people.
    Opposing colonialism, striving for national independence, demanding peaceful coexistence, and opposing the policy of war are the common voices of hundreds of millions of people around the world. The movements of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries to strive for national independence and liberation are constantly developing with the momentum of a prairie fire. The actions of the Vietnamese people to safeguard the Geneva Accords and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland are by no means isolated. They have received and will always receive the firm support of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all peace-loving countries and people in the world.
    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is our brotherly neighbor. The people of China and Vietnam have been drinking from the waters of the Red River and the Mekong River for centuries. The friendship between the people of China and Vietnam, like the Mekong River and the Red River, will flow forever. As a participating country in the Geneva Conference, our government and our people have consistently and solemnly safeguarded the Geneva Accords for the past five years, and have resolutely opposed the conspiracy of US imperialism to invade and enslave Indochina and undermine peace in the Far East. In the future, our government and people will continue to fully support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords and strive for the reunification of their motherland. We believe that with the firm support of the people of Asian and African countries and peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the reunification of their motherland will surely achieve a complete victory. The reunification of Vietnam will surely be fully realized.
    Long live the reunification of Vietnam!
    Long live the solidarity of the Asian and African people!
    Long live world peace!

    我们全力支持英雄的越南人民
    郭沫若在首都各界人民大会上的讲话
    新华社20日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在首都各界人民纪念日内瓦协议五周年、支持越南和平统一大会上的讲话。亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    今天是印度支那和平恢复的五周年纪念日。为了真正实现和巩固印度支那地区的全面和平，为了争取越南的和平统一，亚非人民团结理事会书记处把今天定为
  “越南日”。我们首都各界人民今天在这里举行盛大的集会，热烈地响应亚非人民团结理事会的这一号召，对于英雄的越南人民在争取民族解放和维护亚洲与世界和平的事业中，所获得的辉煌成就，我们首先要表示热烈的衷心的祝贺和敬意。
    越南人民为争取民族的独立和自由，同殖民主义者进行了将近一个世纪的不屈不挠的斗争。经过艰苦的长期岁月，英雄的越南人民终于获得了八月革命的胜利，在1945年9月2日，独立的和统一的越南民主共和国宣告成立了。法国殖民者正像所有的殖民主义者一样，对于殖民地的丧失是不甘心的，它妄想重新恢复对越南的殖民统治，在美、英帝国主义的支援下，发动了镇压印度支那人民的侵略战争。越南人民和其他印度支那二国人民英勇地坚持了九年的民族革命战争，并在战斗中壮大了自己的力量。法国殖民者，尽管有着美帝国主义的大力支持，最后，仍不免遭受到奠边府之战的全军复没的惨败。
    越南人民的胜利迫使法帝国主义不得不在1954年的日内瓦会议上达成协议，在承认印度支那人民的民族权利的基础上恢复印度支那的和平，承认印度支那各国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整，并对它们的内政不予任何干涉。这些原则也得到了其它与会国家的承认。日内瓦协议是越南、柬埔寨和老挝人民长期以来坚决反对殖民主义斗争的辉煌成果。这个胜利对于殖民主义者是有力的打击，对于争取民族解放的广大亚非人民是莫大的鼓舞。印度支那人民的胜利是世界人民共同的胜利，世界各国爱好和平的人民都曾经衷心地为印度支那的和平恢复而欢呼。
    我们都记得很清楚，在日内瓦会议之前，美帝国主义者不顾印度支那各国人民和全世界人民的和平愿望，一直竭力拖延和扩大印度支那战争。1950年6月美国总统杜鲁门就公开声明要加速以军事援助供给在印度支那的法国侵略军队和派遣军事使团直接插手指挥侵略战争。在法国侵略军不断遭到惨重失败以后，正当柏林四外长会议业已建议召开日内瓦会议讨论恢复印度支那和平的时候，美国政府为了扩大印度支那战争，公然派遣美国空军人员直接参加屠杀印度支那三国人民的战争。日内瓦协议的达成粉碎了美帝国主义的罪恶活动。但是，美帝国主义并不甘心于它的失败。就在日内瓦会议结束的时候，美国政府的代表便勾结南越公然拒绝在会议的最后宣言上签名，不愿同与会各国一起参加保证恢复印度支那和平的共同工作，以便日后伺机破坏日内瓦协议。果然，日内瓦协议签订后不久，美国便纠合英、法和其他仆从国家拼凑成东南亚侵略集团，并采取片面宣布对印度支那三国承担军事义务的手法，硬把南越、老挝、柬埔寨放在这个集团的“保护”之下，来阻挠日内瓦协议的实施。在这之后，美帝国主义者对日内瓦协议便进行了一系列明目张胆的破坏。美帝国主义早就有挤掉法帝国主义、霸占整个印度支那的野心。为了实现这一野心，美帝国主义首先控制了南越。以后它又唆使老挝的亲美势力片面毁弃日内瓦协议；对于柬埔寨王国则策划了一系列的军事挑衅和颠覆活动。五年以来，美帝国主义积极培植它在南越的傀儡——吴庭艳和吴氏家族的统治，派遣了大批的军事人员肆无忌惮地运进了大量的杀人武器，帮助吴庭艳集团对越南南部人民进行大规模的屠杀。现在，南越已经变成了美国和吴庭艳集团的屠场。去年12月在“富利集中营”一次就有一千多越南爱国人民惨遭毒手。除此之外，美国侵略者还经常在印度支那地区制造紧张局势，散布战争气氛，进行颠覆活动，破坏印度支那各国人民的和平生活，并威胁亚洲和世界的和平。美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议的罪行是无法抵赖的，它的这些罪行，正使它遭到印度支那和世界各国人民的日益强大的反对。觉醒了的印度支那人民是决不会让美国奴役印度支那人民的阴谋得逞的。
    五年以来，越南民主共和国政府一贯忠实地履行日内瓦协议，为维护印度支那和平和实现祖国的统一作了不懈的努力。在停止敌对行动和军队的集结、转移工作完成后，越南民主共和国政府按照日内瓦协议的规定曾经多次提出建议，要求北南双方就普选统一问题举行协商。但是，吴庭艳集团在美国的唆使和支持下悍然拒绝了越南民主共和国政府的合理建议。由于美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团完全不顾越南人民统一祖国的殷切愿望，粗暴地破坏了日内瓦协议，致使越南至今还处于分裂的局面。
    越南人民是一个统一的民族，有着悠久的历史和文化。越南的领土不容许任何人为的分割。越南的统一应该按照日内瓦协议，由越南人民自己来早日完成。然而在日内瓦协议五周年的今天，越南人民，由于美帝国主义的干涉，仍然在忍受着祖国分裂、家人离散的痛苦。越南人民统一祖国的强烈愿望，应该得到完全的迅速的满足。越南人民有着长期反抗殖民者的斗争经验。历史证明，获得了独立和解放的人民，决不会允许任何殖民者再来坐在自己的头上。越南人民统一祖国的坚强意志，是任何力量所阻挡不了的。美帝国主义者横蛮地阻挠越南的统一，企图长期霸占越南南部的阴谋，一定要遭受到越南人民的彻底粉碎。
    反对殖民主义、争取民族独立、要求和平共处、反对战争政策，是全世界亿万人民的共同呼声。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立和解放的运动，正以大火燎原之势在不断地发展着。越南人民维护日内瓦协议、争取祖国和平统一的行动决不是孤立的。他们已经得到而且还将永远得到亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的坚决支持。
    越南民主共和国是我们的兄弟邻邦。中越两国人民多少世纪以来就同饮着红河和湄公河的水。中越两国人民的友情，也如湄公河和红河一样，长流不息。作为日内瓦会议的参加国，我国政府和我国人民五年来一贯严正地维护日内瓦协议，坚决反对美帝国主义侵占和奴役印度支那、破坏远东和平的阴谋。今后，我国政府和人民仍将全力支持越南人民为彻底实现日内瓦协议和争取祖国统一的正义斗争。我们相信，在亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民坚决支持下，越南人民为争取祖国统一的正义斗争一定会得到彻底的胜利。越南的统一一定会得到完满的实现。
    越南统一万岁！
    亚非人民团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
