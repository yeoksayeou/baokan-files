Xinhua News Agency, July 28th. The Ministry of Agriculture recently convened a meeting in Suqian, Jiangsu Province, to exchange field management experiences for sweet potatoes from six provinces: Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangsu. The meeting called on all sweet potato producing areas to immediately launch a sweet potato field management campaign centered on topdressing and cultivating and weeding, striving for a bumper sweet potato harvest.

This year, these provinces generally planted sweet potatoes about half a month earlier than in previous years, and the planting quality was also better. Sweet potato fields generally underwent deep plowing, with each mu fertilized with 3,000 to 5,000 jin, and planted with about 3,000 seedlings. The area using high ridge double-row planting increased compared to previous years. Spring sweet potatoes have been topdressed and cultivated and weeded once or twice; early-planted summer sweet potatoes have also begun topdressing and cultivating and weeding.

According to reports from various regions, sweet potatoes generally grow well this year. Spring sweet potatoes have already closed the ridges, and summer sweet potatoes are rounding out and spreading vines. Some areas experienced drought during the planting of summer sweet potatoes, resulting in insufficient base fertilizer and causing missing seedlings and broken ridges. In some areas, grass weeds proliferated due to high temperatures and abundant rainfall. To this end, the meeting called on all regions to further strengthen the field management of sweet potatoes, focusing on checking and replenishing seedlings, topdressing, cultivating and weeding, and preventing and controlling pests and diseases. The meeting asked all regions to try their best to ensure that each transplanted seedling survives, striving to achieve full stands. It also called for seizing the current critical period of sweet potato growth to increase topdressing, especially quick-acting fertilizer. The meeting also requested all regions to quickly organize forces to eliminate weeds in the fields and carry out soil cultivation and hilling; implement the principle of "early prevention, treatment when small, and thorough eradication," and promptly eliminate various pests. In particular, the beet armyworm, which poses a serious threat to sweet potatoes, must be quickly eliminated. Finally, the meeting suggested that all regions strengthen drought and flood prevention work to keep the soil in sweet potato fields consistently moist, creating favorable growing conditions for sweet potatoes.

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th. Multi-eared sorghum, which is being piloted in Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, and other places this year, is currently growing well. Most of it is now in the booting stage. Farmers in the pilot areas are strengthening management, striving for a bumper harvest.

This year, Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, and fifteen other provinces and cities introduced more than 9 million jin of multi-eared sorghum seeds from Hebei and Liaoning for widespread pilot planting. This is of great significance for increasing grain production. The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a notice requesting the above provinces and cities to attach importance to the pilot planting of multi-eared sorghum, strengthen leadership, and promptly apply sufficient topdressing and control pests. They should also make early preparations for autumn harvesting, seed retention, and summarizing experiences to lay a good foundation for further expansion of pilot planting next year.

Multi-eared sorghum is a type of sorghum with strong tillering ability, resistant to fertilizer and lodging, and highly resistant to various smuts. Under good cultivation conditions with sufficient fertility and strengthened management, the grain produced per mu can increase by more than 20% compared to ordinary sorghum. Multi-eared sorghum stalks contain a lot of sugar and can be used to extract sugar and make wine. The remaining residue can also be used to feed pigs and livestock. It has a wide range of uses and high economic value. The results of pilot planting in Hebei, Liaoning, Henan, Jiangsu, and Gansu provinces in 1958 were all very good and were well received by the masses. (Attached picture)

    农业部召开六省甘薯生产会议交流经验
    抓紧追肥除草力争甘薯丰收
    山东江苏福建等十五省市试种的多穗高粱生长良好
    新华社28日讯　农业部最近在江苏宿迁召开河北、河南、山东、安徽、湖南和江苏六省的甘薯田间管理经验交流会议，要求各地甘薯产区从现在起，立即开展一个以追肥、中耕除草为中心的甘薯田间管理运动，力争甘薯丰收。
    今年，这几个省栽插甘薯的时间一般都比往年提早半个月左右，栽插的质量也比较好。甘薯田一般做到深耕，每亩施肥三千到五千斤、栽秧三千株左右，采用高垅双行栽插的面积比往年都有增加。春薯的追肥和中耕除草工作都进行了一次到两次；早插的夏薯也开始追肥和中耕除草。
    根据各地汇报，今年各地甘薯一般生长较好，春甘薯都已经封垅，夏甘薯正在圆棵、拖秧。部分地区夏甘薯栽种时受到干旱影响，底肥施得不足，产生了缺苗断垅现象；有的地区因气温高、雨水多，发生草荒。为此，会议要求各地进一步加强甘薯的田间管理，着重做好查苗补苗、追肥、中耕除草和防治病虫害等工作。会议要求各地补苗时尽量做到补一棵活一棵，力争达到全苗；抓紧目前甘薯生长的关键时期，增施追肥，特别是多追速效肥。会议还要求各地迅速组织力量，突击消灭田间杂草和作好中耕培土工作；贯彻“治早、治小、治了”的方针，及时扑灭各种害虫，对危害甘薯比较严重的斜纹夜盗蛾，更要迅速消灭。会议最后建议各地加强抗旱防涝工作，使薯田泥土经常保持一定的湿度，为甘薯创造良好的生长条件。
    新华社28日讯　山东、江苏、福建等地今年试种的多穗高粱，目前生长良好，现在大部分已经孕穗，试种地区的农民，正在加强管理，力争丰收。
    今年山东、江苏、福建等十五个省、市从河北、辽宁引进多穗高粱种子九百多万斤，广泛试种。这对于增产粮食有很大意义。农业部最近发出通知，要求上述省、市重视试种多穗高粱的工作，加强领导，及时施足追肥和防治虫害。并尽早做好秋收留种和总结经验的工作，为明年进一步扩大试种，打下良好基础。
    多穗高粱是一种分蘖力很强的高粱，具有耐肥和抗倒伏的特性，对各种黑穗病的抵抗力也很强，在肥力充足、加强管理的良好栽培条件下，每亩生产的籽粒能比一般高粱增产二成以上。多穗高粱的茎秆含糖分很多，能用来榨糖和制酒，剩下的渣子还可以喂猪、喂牲口。用途广、经济价值高。1958年河北、辽宁、河南、江苏和甘肃等省试种结果都很好，颇受群众欢迎。（附图片）
