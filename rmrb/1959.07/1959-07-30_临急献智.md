    Emergency Wisdom
    The broad masses of Henan Province have been mobilized to combat drought, and scientific and technological workers have also added their strength. This is very important for the fight against drought.
    Drought resistance is an urgent matter. It must be fast and sure to win in resisting natural disasters. In addition to the emergency mobilization of directly related departments, scientific and technological guarantees are also needed, so scientific research departments also have a responsibility. And it must be as fast as "thunder and lightning that leaves no time to cover your ears." Otherwise, if the matter has passed, even the most brilliant science and technology will be useless.
    The Henan Provincial Science and Technology Commission convened a forum of relevant departments to provide science and technology to support the province's drought resistance campaign. This is a way to let scientific workers contribute their wisdom in an emergency, which will surely be welcomed by the people of Henan Province. In order to adapt to the needs of overcoming natural disasters, the leading departments of scientific research, scientific research departments, and scientific workers in Henan Province and other regions need to create more and better ways to contribute their wisdom in an emergency.

    临急献智
    河南省广大群众都动员起来抗旱，科学技术工作者也把自己的力量加进来了，这对抗旱斗争，是非常重要的。
    抗旱是紧迫的事，要快，要稳操胜算地抵抗自然灾害，除了直接有关的部门紧急动员起来，还需要科学技术的保证，所以科学研究部门也负有责任。而且要像“迅雷不及掩耳”般的迅速。否则，事过境迁，再高妙的科学技术也没有用了。
    河南省科学技术委员会召集有关部门座谈，提供科学技术，支援全省抗旱运动。这是让科学工作者们临急献智的一种方法，一定会受到河南全省人民的欢迎。河南省和其他地区的科学研究领导部门，科学研究部门，科学工作者们，为适应战胜自然灾害的需要，有必要创造更多更好的临急献智的方法。
