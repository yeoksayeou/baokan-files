Mountain Climbing Diary

The Third Altitude

July 5th.

The morning was still gloomy; but everyone believed that the weather would improve. After breakfast—some ate tea and hardtack, while others simply boiled the original cooked and dried rice into thin porridge, eating it with pickled vegetables—everyone busied themselves with preparations before departure.

The temperature was minus fifteen degrees Celsius. In such cold weather, binding crampons to climbing boots was a headache. Moving bare hands on the iron claws for five or six minutes, one really didn't know how many fingers would freeze! According to the guidance of "old experience," everyone warmed their hands on their abdomen, binding one foot as quickly as possible, then warming their hands again to bind the other foot.

At half past nine, the team set off. The dark clouds gradually dispersed, and looking down at the Subash meadow, sunlight shone through the cloud seams. All the team members were happy.

From an altitude of 6,200 meters to 6,800 meters, although only rising 600 meters, the slope was small, and the road was particularly long, coupled with the strong wind. In this way, the team members had to undergo another rigorous physical and cold resistance exercise. Female team member and internist Wang Yiqin’s lips were swollen and cracked, and blood was flowing non-stop; but she still insisted on moving forward. She was the weakest in the climbing team, weighing less than fifty kilograms. Everyone was worried about her, fearing that her physical strength would not hold up, and advised her to rest well to stop the bleeding, but she said calmly: "It doesn't matter, let's go!" She knew in her heart that in such low air pressure and with her blood pressure already high, it would be difficult to stop the bleeding. Only after reaching the new camp and resting overnight would it have an effect. The team advanced in the strong wind, the wind rolled up snow and hit the team members' faces, drilling into the eyelashes covered with sunglasses, forming frost particles on the eyelashes, which were both painful and cold. Wind and snow filled the sky, and people could not be seen a few dozen steps away. Along the way, only the shouts from the front could be heard: "Crevasse!" "Be careful!"

We were almost at the third high mountain camp. A crevasse blocked the way. This crevasse was not wide, and all the male and female team members of the first detachment had crossed it. But with each person passing, a piece of snow was wiped off, gradually widening the crevasse. When it came to the second detachment, most of the teams first jumped a strong member across, then pulled from the front and jumped from the back, one by one jumping over. When it came to the third detachment, only Yan Dongliang and Hu Deming jumped over, and the third person did not jump over, but found a snow bridge at the upper end of the crevasse, and crawled across it. The fourth person was Liu Qiming, who wanted to walk across the snow bridge, but as soon as he stepped on it, he fell into the crevasse with the snow. "Protect!" the group leader shouted, and before people could understand what was happening, they inserted their ice axes into the snow, and Liu Qiming, connected to the main rope, was hanging in the crevasse. The three people above hung him for more than ten minutes, but could not pull him up. Just when there was no way, another team arrived. Only Liu Qiming was heard shouting in the crevasse: "Another rope!" So Zhang Junyan from this team asked Qu Yinhua, nicknamed "Three and a Half Tons," to protect him, and lowered a rope himself. Once, twice... sweat dripped from his forehead, but he still couldn't pull him up. "Another ice ax!" Liu Qiming shouted, and "Three and a Half Tons" immediately lowered an ice ax. Two main ropes and an ice ax, with simultaneous efforts from three sides, finally rescued Liu Qiming.

Part of the snow bridge had collapsed. To avoid danger, everyone came up with a way to put four tent poles on the snow bridge. The remaining twelve people, including three female team members such as Wang Yiqin and Zhou Yuying, crawled across the poles.

When the last team of the third detachment arrived at the third high mountain camp, it was already half past seven in the afternoon. Today's snow march lasted ten hours. (To be continued)

    登山日记
    第三高度
    7月5日。
    早晨依然是阴沉沉的；但大家都相信天气会好转过来。吃罢早饭——有人吃茶水和面包干，有人只用原先煮熟晒干的大米熬成稀粥，就着榨菜吃——大家就忙着出发前的准备工作。
    气温在零下十五度。这样冷的天气，给登山靴绑冰爪是一件令人头痛的事。赤手在铁爪上动作五、六分钟，真不知要冻坏多少手指头呢！根据“老经验”的指点，大家都把手在腹部暖热，用最快速度绑好一只脚，然后再暖暖手，去绑另一只脚。
    九时半大队出发。阴云逐渐散开，低头俯视苏巴什草场，阳光已透过云缝照在上面。所有的队员都高兴起来。
    从拔海六千二百米到六千八百米，虽只升高六百米，但因坡度小，道路特别漫长，加之风又很大。这样，队员就要再一次经受严格的体力和耐寒的锻炼。女队员、内科医生王义勤嘴唇冻肿破裂了，血流不止；但是她依然坚持前进。她是登山队体力最差的，体重不到五十公斤。大家都为她担心，怕她体力支持不下来，劝她好好休息止住血，她却坦然地说：“没有关系，走吧！”她心里明白，在气压这样低而血压已变得很高的情况下，要止血是很困难的，只有到达新的营地休息一夜之后才有效果。队伍在大风中前进，大风卷起雪沫打在队员的脸上，钻进队员罩着太阳镜的眼睫毛上，在睫毛上结成霜粒，又疼又冷。风雪弥漫天空，几十步以外就看不见人。一路上只听见前面传来的喊声：“裂缝！“小心！”
    快到第三号高山营地了。一条裂缝挡住了去路。这条裂缝本来不宽，前面第一分队男、女队员全部跨过去了。但每过一个人，便擦掉一块雪，使裂缝逐渐加宽了。临到第二分队，大多数结组都是先跳过一个身体健壮的队员，然后前面拉，后面跳，一个个跳过去。临到第三分队，前面只跳过了阎栋梁、胡德铭两个人，第三个人没有跳过去，却在裂缝的上端找到了雪桥，匍匐着爬了过去。第四个人是刘启明，他本想从雪桥上走过去，谁知刚踏上雪桥，便连人带雪一下掉进裂缝中去了。“保护！”组长一喊，人们在几乎还不明白发生什么事的时候，便把冰镐插入雪中，连结主绳的刘启明，正好吊在裂缝中。上面三个人直吊了十多分钟，也没有把他吊上来。正没有办法，后面一个结组赶到了。只听见刘启明在裂缝中喊：“再来一根绳子！”于是这个结组的张俊岩便叫绰号叫“三吨半”的屈银华保护住，自己向下放了一条绳子。一下，两下，……头上的汗珠直淌，也还是拉不上来。“再来一根冰镐！”刘启明一喊，“三吨半”立刻放下一根冰镐。两条主绳、一根冰镐，三方面同时出力，才把刘启明救了出来。
    雪桥一部分塌下去了。为了避免发生危险，大家想了一个办法，把四根帐篷杆子架在雪桥上。剩下的十二个人，包括王义勤，周玉瑛等三个女队员，都是从杆子上匍匐着爬过去的。
    等到第三分队最后到达第三号高山营地时，已是下午七点半。今天的雪上行军延续了十个小时。（七续）
