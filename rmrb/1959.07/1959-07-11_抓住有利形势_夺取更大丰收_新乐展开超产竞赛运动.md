Seize the Favorable Situation and Strive for a Greater Harvest
Xinle Launches Overproduction Competition Campaign
(According to Hebei Daily) The Xinle County Committee of Hebei Province analyzed the current favorable situation in the countryside and decided to organize the people of the county to launch an overproduction competition campaign to strive for a great autumn harvest.

Favorable Conditions and Current Problems
The current situation in Xinle County's countryside is very good. All people's communes in the county have improved their management through rectification and consolidation. In addition, the 400,000 mu of summer crops have yielded a bumper harvest, and cadres and the masses have explored concrete experiences in implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. At present, more than 70,000 mu of spring millet and 86,000 mu of spring corn are generally growing well, and cash crops are also growing well. The vast number of cadres and masses have further increased their enthusiasm.

The Dongming Village Production Team of Changshou Commune recently issued a proposal to the county's 456 production teams to launch an overproduction competition. Many communes and teams actively responded, and the number of people participating in the overproduction competition quickly increased from more than 160,000 to more than 210,000.

The county committee believes that the favorable conditions for striving for a great autumn harvest are as described above. The current problems are that some communes and teams have suffered from drought and insect pests; there is a shortage of fertilizer, and many lands have not been fertilized with base fertilizer; some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the current favorable situation and do not have enough courage to overcome difficulties; some have developed complacency and complacency after the wheat harvest and have failed to actively stand at the forefront of the movement to lead. After repeated consultations with the cadres of the communes and teams, the county committee proposed to launch a competition to overproduce by 10% to 20% throughout the county on the basis of the implementation of the contracted output targets, to produce more grain, improve the lives of the masses, run the people's communes well, and better support national construction.

Ideological Mobilization
In order to make the overproduction competition movement lively and colorful throughout the county, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses. First of all, it is necessary to do a good job of ideological mobilization among the cadres. In terms of methods, adopt three summaries, three comparisons, six calculations, two catch-ups, and one thought. The three summaries are to summarize the leaping forward experience of 1958, summarize the summer harvest experience, and summarize the superiority of the communes; the three comparisons are to compare the conditions of last year, compare high-yield models, and compare advanced communes and teams; the six calculations are to calculate the accounts of labor, fertilizer, funds, water sources, technology, gains and losses; the two catch-ups are to catch up with advanced teams and catch up with pacesetters; and the one thought is to mobilize all the people to think of ways. Second, it is necessary to explain the policies clearly. Explain to the masses that the purpose of overproduction is to increase production, produce more grain, which is beneficial to themselves and the country, and it is necessary to publicize to the masses the policies of equivalent exchange, distribution according to work, more work more gain, and overproduction rewards. Third, explain how to achieve the overproduction targets. Overproduction is the goal of struggle for the 450,000 people of the county. To achieve this goal, it should be done from reality and seek truth from facts. Some teams can overproduce more, and some teams can overproduce less. Don't be all the same. At the same time, it is necessary to educate the masses to formulate overproduction measures and put forward specific requirements, and try every means to think of ways to increase production.

Critical Measures
At present, the key measures for production are:

First, eliminate the three types of seedlings. Among the county's 490,000 mu of spring-sown crops, 150,000 mu are not growing well enough. It is necessary to organize labor to carry out a blitz of topdressing, weeding, pest control, and intertillage for the three types of seedlings.

Second, vigorously engage in fertilizer accumulation movement. Starting from July 1st, a magnificent upsurge of fertilizer accumulation will be launched. In terms of fertilizer accumulation methods, it is necessary to highlight the pressing of green manure and raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer. It is required that one pig per mu of wheat field is raised before wheat planting, and three to five pigs are raised per household by the end of the year. At the same time, it is necessary to develop a large number of livestock and poultry such as sheep, chickens, ducks, and rabbits. Mountainous areas must engage in fumigation fertilizer in every team. Combined with the summer sanitation movement, a large amount of miscellaneous fertilizer should be collected, and garbage, melon peels, vegetable leaves, dirty soil, grass clippings, sludge, etc. should be utilized.

Third, build water conservancy projects and strive for guaranteed harvests despite drought and flood. From top to bottom, the county establishes and improves water conservancy front lines, strengthens the protection and utilization of existing water conservancy projects, and achieves reasonable irrigation. At present, it is necessary to focus on strengthening the flood and waterlogging prevention work of various reservoirs, rivers, and depressions to ensure that dams do not collapse and embankments do not break during the flood season.

Fourth, defeat insect pests. According to the principle of prevention being more important than treatment, establish insect condition inspection teams and professional pest control teams, and stipulate an inspection reporting system.

Fifth, timely intertillage to eliminate weeds and ensure strong seedlings. Early autumn crops should be deep intertilled and intertilled more often. Cotton should be intertilled with the method of shallow first, then deep, then shallow again. For wheat field crops, weeds and stubble should be removed as early as possible, intertilled immediately, and early weeding and deep weeding should be carried out vigorously to increase soil fertility, loosen the soil and ventilate, conserve water and retain moisture, achieve clean ridges and backs, timely soil cultivation, and promote strong seedling growth.

High-Efficiency Movement
Faced with the contradiction of many agricultural tasks and insufficient labor, in addition to appropriately rectifying county and commune industries and putting some of the labor force on the water conservancy front into agricultural production, a high-efficiency movement will be carried out throughout the county. Organize commune members to carry out a movement of comparing attendance, comparing efficiency, comparing enthusiasm, comparing creativity, looking at quantity, and looking at quality; implement a production responsibility system of five contracts and six fixings to the field. The five contracts are: the team leader contracts for proper labor allocation without idling; the group leader contracts for reasonable employment and giving play to expertise; field operations are implemented by group contracting of plots, household contracting of blocks, and person contracting of ridges. The six fixings to the field are to assign special personnel to manage the crops to the field: first, fix the plot, second, fix the quality, third, fix the measures, fourth, fix the remuneration, fifth, fix the targets, and sixth, fix the rewards. In order to improve work efficiency, a field acceptance system is implemented. Commune members who exceed the quota and meet the quality requirements will be given appropriate rewards in addition to more pay for more work. Commune members who consistently fail to meet the quota and whose quality is poor will be criticized and educated. For agricultural work that does not meet the quality requirements, rework will not be counted as work in order to improve work efficiency and improve quality. In carrying out the high-efficiency movement, it is necessary to strengthen tool reform work and implement hard work, practical work, and skillful work. In the overproduction movement, close attention must be paid to the lives of the masses, and a combination of work and rest must be achieved.

Support from All Sides
County and commune agricultural tool manufacturing and repair industries should manufacture agricultural tools with new styles, high efficiency, and low costs. Every commune should have a repair station, and iron and woodworking workers should be organized to go to the countryside to build and repair agricultural tools for the masses. The Industrial Bureau is responsible for organizing skilled repair personnel to go to the countryside to repair portable steam engines, diesel engines, and gas generators. The transportation department must transport production materials and living materials to the countryside in a timely manner. The commercial department should face the countryside, face production, and deliver goods to the door in a timely manner to ensure the normal supply of production and living materials. Weather stations and technical research departments should all serve to strive for overproduction.

Strengthen Leadership
The county committee emphasized that it is necessary to go deep into leadership, try to leave time for grassroots cadres to participate in production and lead production. In terms of working methods, adopt the method of five stations and five divisions. First, the tasks are stationed in the teams, the priorities are divided, and the center is clarified. Second, the communes and teams are stationed in the teams, the advanced and the backward are divided, the advanced are cultivated, and the backward are helped. Grasp both ends to drive the middle and leap forward together. Third, the labor force and animal power are stationed in the teams, and the rational division of labor and industries is implemented. Fourth, the time is stationed in the teams, and the climax is carried out in stages. For each production link and each production front, clear combat tasks are put forward in a timely manner to keep the vast number of masses in high spirits. Fifth, the cadres are stationed in the teams and the leadership is divided and contracted. The county committee pointed out that in leading the overproduction movement, it is necessary to fully rely on and mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out mass movements, leading cadres take the lead in participating in labor, closely connect the relations between cadres and masses, discover problems and guide production in a timely manner through participating in production, and widely adopt forms such as holding on-site meetings and exhibitions to learn from and promote advanced experience, creating a momentum for everyone to compare with the advanced and strive for the upstream.

    抓住有利形势　夺取更大丰收
    新乐展开超产竞赛运动
    据河北日报消息　河北省新乐县委分析了当前农村有利形势，决定组织全县人民开展超产竞赛运动，夺取秋季大丰收。
    有利条件和当前问题
    新乐县当前农村的形势很好，全县所有人民公社经过整顿巩固工作，改善了经营管理，加上四十万亩夏收作物获得丰收，干部群众摸索到了具体执行“八字宪法”的经验。目前七万多亩春谷、八万六千亩春玉米一般生长良好，经济作物长得也好，广大干部、群众进一步增加了干劲。
    长寿公社东名村生产队，最近向全县四百五十六个生产队发出了开展超产竞赛的倡议，不少社、队积极响应，全县参加超产竞赛运动的人数很快由十六万多人增加到二十一万多人。
    县委认为，争取秋季大丰收的有利条件如上所述，当前的问题是，有的社、队发生了旱灾、虫灾；肥料不足，有不少土地没有施上底肥；一部分干部对当前的有利形势认识不足，克服困难的勇气不大；有的在小麦丰收后产生了自满麻痹情绪，未能积极站在运动前面进行领导。县委在与公社、队的干部反复商量后，提出在包产指标落实的基础上，在全县范围内开展超产一成、二成的竞赛运动；多增产一些粮食，改善群众生活，办好人民公社，更好地支持国家建设。
    思想发动
    为使超产竞赛运动在全县开展的有声有色，要充分发动群众。首先要在干部中作好思想发动工作。在方法上，采取三总、三比、六算、两赶、一想。三总是总结1958年的跃进经验，总结夏季丰收的经验，总结公社的优越性；三比是比去年条件，比高产典型，比先进社队；六算是算劳动力、肥料、资金、水源、技术、得失的账；两赶是赶先进队、赶标兵；一想是发动全民想办法。第二，要讲清政策。向群众讲清超产的目的是为了增加生产，多打粮食，对自己对国家都有好处，并且要向群众宣传等价交换、按劳分配、多劳多得、超产奖励的政策。第三，讲清如何实现超产指标。超产是全县四十五万人民的奋斗目标，要实现这个奋斗目标，就应当做到从实际出发，实事求是，有的队可以多超，有的队可以少超，不要千篇一律。同时要教育群众订出超产措施，提出具体要求，千方百计想增产办法。
    关键性措施
    目前，生产上的关键性措施是：
    第一，消灭三类苗。全县的四十九万亩春播作物中，有十五万亩生长不够好，要组织劳动力，突击三类苗的追肥、锄草、除虫、中耕。
    第二，大搞积肥运动。从7月1日起，掀起规模壮阔的积肥高潮。在积肥方法上，要突出地抓住压绿肥、养猪积肥，要求种麦前做到麦田一亩一猪，年底达到户户养猪三、五口；同时要大量发展羊、鸡、鸭、兔家畜、家禽；山区要队队搞熏肥；结合夏季卫生运动，大量收集杂肥，把垃圾、瓜皮、菜叶、脏土、草末、污泥等都利用起来。
    第三、兴修水利，力争旱涝保丰收。全县自上而下的建立健全水利战线，对已有的水利工程加强护养利用，达到合理浇水。当前要突出加强各水库、河道、洼地的防洪、防涝工作，力争在汛期不倒坝、不决口。
    第四，战胜虫害。根据防重于治的方针，建立虫情检查组和除虫专业队，规定检查报告制度。
    第五，及时中耕灭草，保证苗壮苗旺。早秋作物要作到深中耕、多中耕；棉花作到先浅后深再浅的中耕方法；小麦田间作物，要即早锄草灭茬，即时中耕，大抓早锄、深锄，增加土壤肥力，松土透风，保水保墒，达到垅清背净，培土及时，促使幼苗茁壮生长。
    高工效运动
    面对着农活多、劳动力不足的矛盾，除适当地整顿县、社工业和将水利战线上的一部分劳动力投入农业生产外，在全县范围内开展一个高工效运动。组织社员开展比出勤、比效率、比干劲、比创造、看数量、看质量的运动；实行五包、六定到田的生产责任制。五包是：队长包劳动力支配得当，不窝工；组长包用人合理，发挥专长；田间作业实行组包片，户包块，人包垅。六定到田是把作物固定专人到田管理：一定地块，二定质量，三定措施，四定报酬，五定指标，六定奖励。为提高工效，实行田间验收制度，对超过定额、符合质量要求的社员，除多劳多得报酬外，还给以适当的奖励；对于经常达不到定额且质量低劣的社员，要进行批评教育；对不符合质量要求的农活，返工不计工，以提高工效，提高质量。在开展高工效运动中，要加强工具改革工作，实行苦干、实干、巧干。在超产运动中，要十分注意群众生活，做到劳逸结合。
    各方面的支援
    县、社农具制造修配工业，要制造样式新、效率高、成本低的农具，社社有修配站，并组织铁木工人下乡给群众打造和修理农具。工业局负责组织技术较高的修配人员下乡，修理锅驼机、柴油机、煤气机。交通部门要及时地把生产资料、生活资料运到农村。商业部门要面向农村，面向生产，及时送货上门，保证生产、生活资料的正常供应。气象站，技术研究部门都应当为力争超产服务。
    加强领导
    县委强调提出要深入领导，尽量给基层干部留出时间，参加生产领导生产。在工作方法上，采取五站、五分的方法，一是任务站队，分出轻重缓急，明确中心；二是社、队站队，分出先进和后进，培养先进，帮助后进，抓住两头带动中间，一齐跃进；三是劳动力、畜力站队，实行合理分工分业；四是时间站队，分段搞高潮，每一个生产环节，每一条生产战线，及时提出明确的战斗任务，使广大群众经常斗志昂扬；五是干部站队，分工包干领导。县委指出，在领导超产运动中，要充分依靠发动群众，大搞群众运动，领导干部带头参加劳动，密切干群关系，及时地通过参加生产发现问题，指导生产；广泛地采用开现场会、展览会等形式，学习和推广先进经验，造成人人比先进、争上游的声势。
