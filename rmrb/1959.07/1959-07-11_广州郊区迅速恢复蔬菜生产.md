Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: Guangzhou suburban farmers, having victoriously completed flood resistance and drainage, are vigorously salvaging submerged vegetables and rapidly resuming vegetable production. Currently, of the more than 110,000 mu of submerged vegetables, more than 50,000 mu have been salvaged; in addition, more than 39,000 mu have been replanted.

Since mid-June, some vegetable plots and rice paddies in the suburbs of Guangzhou have been damaged by mountain floods and waterlogging. Among them, more than 113,000 mu of vegetables were submerged, and more than 45,000 mu were completely lost. After the flood receded, suburban farmers, while repairing embankments and draining waterlogged areas, immediately harvested those vegetables that were basically ripe. Those that were more than 80% drowned were immediately plowed and replanted. Those that were injured by the submergence but could still be saved were immediately washed, had rotten leaves removed, and were top-dressed with fertilizer for rescue.

    广州郊区迅速恢复蔬菜生产
    据新华社广州讯　广州市郊区农民在胜利完成抗洪、排涝的基础上，大力抢救受浸蔬菜，迅速恢复蔬菜生产。目前，受淹的十一万多亩蔬菜中，有五万多亩已经抢救出来；另外还补种了三万九千多亩。
    6月中旬以来，广州市郊区有部分菜地和稻田遭到山洪和渍水的损害，其中受淹的蔬菜达十一万三千多亩，有四万五千多亩全部失收。洪水消退后，郊区农民一面抢修围堤、排除渍水；一面对那些已经基本成熟的蔬菜立即抢收，已经淹死八成以上的，立即翻犁补种，虽被浸伤但还可挽救的，立即洗苗、除烂叶、追肥，进行抢救。
