Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The new technical management regulations (draft) for China's railways will be implemented nationwide on July 1st. This new set of regulations is based on the original technical management regulations, absorbing the experience of China's railway technical management in recent years, especially the experience of the Great Leap Forward in railway work since 1958. It is the crystallization of the production practice of Chinese railway workers.

The Ministry of Railways pointed out that the implementation of the new regulations nationwide will further strengthen China's railway technical management work, establish railway transportation and production work more firmly on a scientific basis, and promote the continued leap forward in railway work this year.

China's original railway technical management regulations consisted of three volumes, with more than 210,000 words. It has been implemented for more than three years since 1956. This regulation has played a significant role in ensuring and promoting railway transportation and production. However, in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward last year, the productive forces of railway transportation have developed vigorously, breaking through some of the provisions in the original regulations; production conditions have also undergone some new changes, so the original regulations are not entirely suitable. Moreover, some of the clauses in the original regulations were too rigid and cumbersome. Based on these circumstances, the Ministry of Railways mobilized the broad masses of workers and staff to begin the revision of the technical regulations in October 1958. The new regulations abolished some of the inapplicable parts of the original, revised and merged the repetitive and cumbersome parts, and added new content, consolidating the original three volumes into one.

The most distinct feature of the new regulations is that it comprehensively implements the "more, faster, better, and more economical" policy, ensuring both improved transportation efficiency and transportation safety. For example, when a train is forced to stop on a railway line for various reasons, the type of protection to be given to the train that is forced to stop is very important to railway transport safety and efficiency. The new regulations, based on experience in practice, have revised the distance and method of train protection work on lines equipped with automatic block equipment. This not only ensures better traffic safety but also reduces the train's forced stop time by more than twenty minutes. The revision of the wear depth of passenger car wheels and steel rails in the new regulations is also based on the requirements of both traffic safety and the extension of wheel service life.

The new regulations reflect the valuable revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of railway workers and staff and also stipulate the necessary scientific conditions and foundation. This is another feature of the new regulations. Shunting is an important task that the railway department is carrying out at all times. The original regulations stipulated that the shunting speed through the side of the turnout must not exceed 25 kilometers per hour. The on-site workers and drivers believe that this provision is too conservative, and that on some larger types of turnouts, the driving speed can be faster. The new regulations absorb the opinions of the workers and staff, and abolished the original mechanical stipulation on the driving speed on the turnouts, and instead changed it to allow each station and railway engineering department to determine different driving speeds after identification and calculation based on various different turnouts on site. This not only ensures the safety of shunting but also ensures that the driving speed is appropriately increased under possible conditions, giving full play to the production enthusiasm of the masses of workers and staff. The experience of "high platform, low cargo position" which is being promoted nationwide is a major creation of railway transport workers and staff to improve loading and unloading efficiency since last year. The new regulations affirm this experience and point out that loading and unloading platforms and cargo positions suitable for different varieties of goods should be built.

The third feature of the new regulations is that, considering the distribution of railway transport enterprises across the country and the long routes, it emphasizes the necessity of centralized unity, and also appropriately takes into account the flexibility of adapting to local conditions.

The process of the birth of China's new technical management regulations for railways also reversed the past practice of a few people "building cars behind closed doors" and adopted the mass line method. Beginning at the end of November 1958, under the leadership of the Communist Party organization, eight railway bureaus in Jinzhou, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Shenyang, Beijing, Zhengzhou, Mudanjiang, and Jinan mobilized the masses of workers and staff to conduct extensive airing of views on the revision of technical regulations, posting tens of thousands of big-character posters. These railway bureaus also established special organizations jointly participated in by leading cadres, engineering technicians, and workers to lead this work. Engineering technicians went out of the office and went deep into the lines and production sites to observe and calculate, and held workers' forums to collect opinions on the revision of the regulations. The Ministry of Railways also sent three working groups to Jinzhou, Taiyuan, Xi'an, and other railway bureaus to participate in this work. Finally, the Ministry of Railways, based on the draft technical management regulations compiled by various bureaus, compiled the new national railway technical management regulations after comprehensive sorting, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses. The new regulations also specifically stipulate that the technical management rules of each station should be jointly compiled by the station master of each station with the relevant personnel. These rules are the basis for traffic at each station, and in the past they were formulated by the station master alone.

Before the new regulations were implemented, railway workers and staff across the country had conducted extensive learning and various preparations. The Ministry of Railways requires all localities to further listen to the opinions of the masses of workers and staff in the process of learning and trial implementation, analyze and study them, and make more complete revisions in the future.

    进一步加强铁路技术管理
    铁道部总结经验制定技术规程推动工作大跃进
    新规程7月1日起在全国试行。它的特点是：既要求充分发挥运输效率，又保证运输的安全；既反映了群众的干劲，也规定了必需的科学条件和基础；既强调集中统一的必要性，又注意因事因地制宜的灵活性。
    新华社6日讯　我国铁路新的技术管理规程（草案）7月1日起在全国试行。这一套新规程，是在原有技术管理规程的基础上，吸收了几年来我国铁路技术管理的经验，特别是1958年以来铁路工作大跃进的经验而订立的。它是我国铁路职工生产实践的结晶。
    铁道部指出，新规程在全国的贯彻执行，将进一步加强我国铁路的技术管理工作，把铁路运输、生产工作更稳固地建立在科学的基础上，推动今年的铁路工作继续跃进。
    我国原来的铁路技术管理规程，有三大本，二十一万多字。从1956年开始实行，已经三年多了。这个规程对铁路运输和生产工作，起了很大的保证和促进作用。但是，几年来特别是去年大跃进以来，铁路运输的生产力有了蓬勃的发展，突破了原来规程中的一些规定；生产条件也发生了一些新的变化，因此原来的规程就显得不完全合适了。而且原来的规程中，有的条文订得太死、太繁琐。根据这些情况，铁道部动员了广大职工，从1958年10月开始了技术规程的修编工作。新规程废除了原来一些不适用的部分，修改、归并了重复、繁琐的部分，增添了新的内容。把原来的三大本合而为一。
    新规程最鲜明的特点是，它全面贯彻了“多、快、好、省”的方针，既要保证提高运输效率，也要保证运输安全。例如，列车在铁路线上行驶，有时因为种种原故被迫停车。对于这种被迫停驶的列车进行怎样的防护，这对铁路运输的安全和效率关系很大。新规程根据实践中的经验，对于设有自动闭塞装置的线路上，列车防护工作的距离、方法都作了修改，这样既可以更好地保证行车安全，还可以减少列车的被迫停车时间二十多分钟。新规程中对于客车车轮和钢轨磨耗深度的修改，也是基于既要行车安全，又要延长车轮使用时间这两个要求加以修订的。
    这次的新规程里反映了广大铁路职工可贵的革命干劲，同时也规定了必需的科学条件和基础。这是新规程的另一个特点。调动车辆是铁路部门一件无时无刻不在进行着的重要工作，过去规程里规定，经过道岔侧向运行的调车速度，每小时一律不得超过二十五公里。现场的职工和司机们认为这样的规定太保守了，在一些较大类型的道岔上，行车速度是可以更快一些的。新规程吸收了职工们的意见，对道岔上的行车速度，废除了原来那种机械的规定，而改为由各车站和铁路工务部门，根据现场各种不同的道岔，经过鉴定计算，规定不同的行车速度。这样既可以保证调车的安全，又保证了在可能条件下适当地提高行车速度，发挥了职工群众的生产积极性。目前正在全国各地推行的“高站台、低货位”的经验，是去年以来铁路运输职工为了提高装卸和搬运效率的一项重大创造。新规程里肯定了这项经验，并且指出应该根据货物的不同品种，修建适用的装卸货物的站台和货位。
    新规程的第三个特点是，考虑到铁路运输企业分布全国而且路线漫长这一情况，强调了集中统一的必要性，同时也适当照顾了因事因地制宜的灵活性。
    我国铁路技术管理新规程诞生的过程，也一反过去少数人“闭门造车”的作法，而采取了群众路线的方法。从1958年11月底开始，锦州、太原、西安、沈阳、北京、郑州、牡丹江、济南等八个铁路局，在中共组织的领导下，发动职工群众，就修改技术规程进行了大鸣大放，张贴了数以万张计的大字报。这几个铁路局还专门成立了由领导干部、工程技术人员和工人共同参加的机构，领导这一工作。工程技术人员纷纷走出办公室，深入线路和生产现场观察、计算，并召开工人座谈会，搜集修改规程的意见。铁道部也派出了三个工作组，到锦州、太原、西安等铁路局参加这一工作。最后，铁道部根据各局编制的技术管理规程草案，经过综合整理，取长补短，编成了新的全国铁路技术管理规程。新规程里还特别规定，各车站的技术管理细则，要由各站站长吸收有关方面人员共同编制。这种细则是各车站行车的依据，过去都是由站长一人制定的。
    在新规程试行之前，全国各地的铁路职工已经进行了广泛的学习和各种准备工作。铁道部要求各地在学习和试行中，进一步听取职工群众的意见，加以分析研究，将来再作更完整的修正。（附图片）
