    Imposing Momentum
    Xu Dongliang
    For half a month, the people of the whole country have been paying attention to the news about the Dongjiang flood in the newspaper. A comrade from Guangdong pointed to the newspaper and said: It's truly "a letter from home is worth ten thousand gold!" He was worried about the fate of his compatriots and relatives, and this feeling is understandable to everyone.
    Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, replied loudly to us: "We must take back what the flood has taken away!" This voice, with its imposing momentum, is enough to overwhelm the high water level of the Pearl River. This conversation is a magnificent poem, expressing that the people of socialist countries will never be defeated by any difficulties.
    This flood cannot be said to be anything other than serious. However, as long as the lives of the people are preserved, homes can be rebuilt and production can be restored. As Comrade Tao Zhu said, "What nature takes away from us, we must take back from nature." Moreover, the whole country is supporting us. A single dark cloud cannot cover the sky. When one region suffers, the people of the whole country support it together. This fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of our socialist country. Reading the newspaper, we can already foresee the scene of large-scale construction and reconstruction of homes after the autumn harvest.
    The flood itself is certainly not a good thing, but such a large flood cannot be reversed by today's manpower. Precisely because of this, "learn a lesson from one event to increase your wisdom," turning negativity into positivity, and making more tenacious efforts for future safety. The flood can only be fierce for a while, but the will of the people is forever invincible. After reading this conversation, what appears before our eyes is no longer a desolate swamp, but an endless expanse of newly planted seedlings and magnificent water conservancy projects.
    A fierce flood has been driven back, and what will follow is another huge wave, a huge wave created by the labor of the people, and this wave will surpass the flood peak by tens of thousands of feet. From now on, the people of Dongjiang will live and work in peace and contentment, and will no longer see cradles turned into small boats.

    气势磅礴
    许栋梁
    半个月来，全国人民注视着报上关于东江水灾的消息，有位广东的同志指着报纸说：真是“家书抵万金”啊！他担忧自己的同胞、亲人的命运，这种心情是谁都能理解的。
    中共广东省委第一书记陶铸同志宏亮地回答了我们：“洪水夺走的我们定要拿回来！”这个声音，其气势的磅礴，足以压倒珠江高水位。这篇谈话是壮丽的诗，它表达了社会主义国家的人民永远不会被任何困难所战胜。
    这场水灾不能不说是严重的。但是，只要保全了人民的生命，就能重建家园，恢复生产。正如陶铸同志所说的“自然界拿走我们的东西，我们要向自然界拿回来。”何况，全国都在支援。一块乌云遮不住天，一个地区受灾，全国人民一齐支援，这充分说明了我们社会主义国家无比的优越。我们读着报，已经预见到秋收后大兴土木重整家园的图景了。
    水灾本身当然不是一件好事，但这样大的洪水，却不是今天的人力所能挽回。正因为这样，“经一事，长一智”，化消极为积极，为今后的安全作更顽强的斗争。洪水只能逞凶于一时，人民的意志才是永远不可战胜的。读完了这篇谈话，在我们眼前呈现的不再是一片荒芜的水沼，而是一望无际抢种了的新苗和宏伟的水利工程。
    一场凶暴的洪水被打退了，紧接着将要掀起的是另一个巨浪，人民劳动创造的巨浪，这个巨浪将会超过洪峰千万丈。从今以后，东江人民将要安居乐业，再也不会看到摇篮变成小船了。
