Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 19th: Sichuan's early rice harvesting work is in full swing. Currently, along both banks of the Yangtze River, millions of farmers are active in the fields, the scene being a sea of people during the day and brightly lit at night. In the terraced fields of the east and north, waves of rice shimmer gold, and the sound of threshing echoes in the air.

This year, Sichuan's early rice has grown densely and produced many ears due to the widespread implementation of reasonable close planting. Therefore, the amount of labor required for harvesting has greatly increased compared to previous years. To simultaneously ensure that late rice planting is not delayed, various people's communes initially invested their main strength in the "double抢 (qiang)" battle of seizing the harvest and seizing the planting, and extensively launched a high work efficiency movement. In the high work efficiency competition, the harvesting speed of the Shidong Commune in Luxian County was one-third faster than last year. Luzhou Prefecture universally implemented several methods, such as covering the mixing buckets, heavily threshing and lightly shaking, diligently turning and diligently threshing, and picking while threshing. At the same time, special teams of elderly people and children were organized to pick up grains, and the amount of grain scattered was greatly reduced compared to previous years.

The tense "double抢 (qiang)" work has received strong support from cities and towns. In Changning County, in addition to sending more than 1,000 people to the countryside from various government agencies, schools, and factories, commercial departments also organized many delivery teams to send more than 60,000 pieces of agricultural tools needed for "double抢 (qiang)" to the rural areas. Medical departments also organized more than 250 medical personnel to patrol the fields and provide medical care for commune members. (Attached photo)

    四川福建普收早稻
    据新华社成都19日电　四川早稻收割工作全面展开。目前，沿长江两岸，成百万农民活跃在田野上，白天人山人海，入夜灯火通明。东部和北部的层层梯田里稻浪泛金，打谷声回荡空中。
    今年四川早稻由于普遍实行合理密植，因此，长得密，结穗多，收割的劳动量比往年大大增加。为了同时保证晚稻不误季节及时栽插，各地人民公社一开始就把最主要的力量投入抢收抢插的“双抢”战线，广泛地展开了高工效运动。泸县石洞公社在高工效竞赛中，收割速度比去年快三分之一。泸州专区普遍实行了拌桶加盖，重打轻抖，勤翻勤打，边打边拣等几项办法，同时专门组织老年和儿童拣粮队，抛撒比往年大大减少。
    紧张的“双抢”工作，得到了各地城镇的大力支援。长宁县各机关、学校、厂矿除派出了一千多人下乡外，商业部门还组织许多送货小组，把六万多件“双抢”需要的农具送到农村，医务部门也组织了二百五十多个医务人员巡回田间，为社员们看病。（附图片）
