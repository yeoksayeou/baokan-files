    Sanmenxia Builders Race Against the Flood
    Part of the Dam Body Reaches 310 Meters Elevation
    Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power Inspects and Finds the Dam's Concrete Engineering Quality to be Good

    (Reported by this newspaper) The builders of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project are racing against the flood. By July 5th, part of the main structure of the flood control dam had reached an elevation of 310 meters, which can play a partial role in flood control. The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power's Engineering Quality Inspection Team recently conducted a six-day on-site inspection of the project quality and concluded that the concrete engineering quality of the dam is good.

    The members of this inspection team included Chinese and Soviet experts, as well as leading cadres from various large-scale concrete engineering construction and design units. They believe that the external dimensions and structure of the Sanmenxia Dam basically meet the requirements of the construction drawings. Except for a very few defects on the surface that need to be addressed, the concrete appears dense and solid upon visual inspection. They conducted tens of thousands of tests on the concrete engineering, and the test results showed that the compressive strength, impermeability, and frost resistance of the concrete engineering can all meet the design requirements. The inspection team believes that within the dam area, according to the sampling tests of the foundation rock, the compressive strength exceeds the design requirement of not less than 1,000 kilograms of pressure per square meter. The rock of Shenmen Island was originally very good, but the height difference between it and the deep pit of the riverbed was significant. To ensure the quality of the project, although the amount of excavation was large and the construction period was somewhat extended, the construction unit still excavated it into several steps according to the advice of Soviet experts.

    The inspection team believes that the significant achievements made by the Sanmenxia project are mainly due to the fact that the leadership of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau has consistently adhered to a relatively strict set of rules and regulations regarding the quality of concrete engineering from beginning to end, and has a relatively sound quality inspection organization. While observing the rules and regulations, they also insisted on implementing a mass-based three-inspection system for quality control: the first two inspections are carried out by the worker groups of the construction unit and the on-site construction technicians, and the third inspection is carried out by the inspectors of the inspection station. During the concrete pouring process, from one process to the next, inspection must be carried out, and handover can only be done after a certificate of conformity is issued. In order to prevent the tendency of neglecting quality that may occur after focusing on speed, the Party Committee of the Engineering Bureau also organized a high-yield, high-quality, safe, and economical competition movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution starting in April to ensure the quality of the dam.

    三门峡建设者正在和洪水赛跑
    部分坝体达到310米高程
    经水利电力部检查大坝混凝土工程质量良好
    本报讯　三门峡水利枢纽工程的建设者正在和洪水赛跑。到7月5日止，拦洪大坝的部分主体工程已达到三百一十米的高程，可以起到部分的拦洪作用。水利电力部工程质量检查组最近对工程质量进行了为时六天的现场检查，认为大坝的混凝土工程质量良好。
    参加这个检查组的人员，有中国和苏联的专家，以及各大型混凝土工程施工和设计单位的领导干部。他们认为三门峡大坝的外形尺寸和结构，基本上符合施工图纸的要求，表面除了极个别有缺陷需要处理以外，从直观检查，混凝土密实坚硬。他们对混凝土工程作了成万次的试验，试验结果，混凝土工程的抗压强度、抗渗性、抗冻性，都能达到设计要求。检查组认为，在坝区范围内，根据所作的基础岩石的取样试验，抗压强度都超过了设计上提出的不小于每平方米面积承受一千公斤压力的要求。神门岛的岩石本来是很好的，但是它同河床深坑的高差悬殊；为了保证工程质量，虽然开挖量较大，工期有所延长，施工单位仍然根据苏联专家的意见开挖成若干台阶。
    检查组认为，三门峡工程所取得的巨大成绩，主要是由于三门峡工程局领导上对于混凝土工程的质量自始至终坚持了一套比较严格的规章制度，并且有一套比较健全的质量检查机构。在遵守规章制度的同时，还坚持贯彻了群众性的检查质量的三检制度：头两次检查由施工单位的工人小组和现场施工技术人员进行，第三次检查由检查站检查员执行。在混凝土的浇筑过程中，由一个工序到下一个工序，一定要经过检查，签发合格证以后才可以交接。工程局党委为了防止重视速度以后可能发生的忽视质量的偏向，又从4月份开始组织以技术革新和技术革命为中心的高产、优质、安全、节约竞赛运动，保证大坝的质量。（附图片）
