First Phase Basically Completed, Three Units Put into Production
Beijing Thermal Power Plant Rushes to Build Second Phase

(Our Dispatch) The first phase of construction of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant, which brings huge power and heat to the people of the capital, is basically completed. The equipment of the three units has been put into production one after another. After a period of operation, the power generation has reached the design target. Now, the plant sends out a large amount of electricity every day for use in Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan; its heat has also begun to supply production for more than a dozen units such as the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant.

The completed construction area of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant totals more than 57,000 square meters, with a maximum height of 34.8 meters, and a total of three large turbine generators and high-temperature and high-pressure boilers have been installed. In addition to generating electricity, it can also supply other factories and residents with huge amounts of steam and hot water for production and heating. This is a high-temperature, high-pressure automated factory equipped with advanced technology, and its technical design and main equipment are supplied by the Soviet Union. The operation of the main equipment is adjusted and controlled by electronic automatic regulators. The amount of coal powder burned in the boiler can be adjusted automatically according to the pressure and temperature inside the furnace. If an accident occurs with some equipment, the machine will stop running automatically and automatically start the standby equipment to keep the machine running. These can reduce the labor intensity of workers and reduce equipment accidents.

It took only one year and nine months from the start of construction of this thermal power plant to the full production of the first phase of the project. The quality of civil engineering and installation projects basically met the design requirements.

Also, the second phase of construction of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant is in full swing. After the completion of the project, the power generation capacity of the plant will be doubled compared to now.

The second-phase construction project of this plant includes the main plant building, a larger-capacity turbine generator, three huge boilers, power supply and heating equipment, and a series of other ancillary facilities. At present, the construction of the main plant building has been basically completed, the turbine generator has begun to be installed, and the first boiler is also being connected to various pipelines.

Like the first phase of the project, the main equipment for the second phase of the project is also advanced technology equipment supplied by the Soviet Union. Among them, the turbine generator is the largest power generation equipment in our country at present. (Attached picture)

### 首期工程基本结束　三个机组投入生产  北京热电厂赶建二期工程

    首期工程基本结束　三个机组投入生产
    北京热电厂赶建二期工程
    本报讯　给首都人民带来巨大电力和热力的北京热电厂第一期建厂工程基本结束，三个机组的各项设备已经先后投入生产。经过一段运行以后，发电出力已经达到设计指标。现在，这个厂每天发出大量的电力供应京津唐各地使用；它的热力也开始供应北京第一机床厂等十几个单位生产上使用。
    北京热电厂已完工的建筑面积共五万七千多平方米，最高处达三十四点八米，共安装好大型汽轮发电机、高温高压锅炉各三台。它除了发电，还能供应其他工厂和居民巨大热量的蒸气和热水作为生产和取暖用。这是个用先进技术装备起来的高温高压自动化工厂，它的技术设计和主要设备都是苏联供给的。主要设备的运行是由电子自动调整器调节和控制。锅炉内燃烧的煤粉量可以根据炉内的压力和温度自行调整。有的设备如果出了事故，机器会自己停止运行，并且自动把备用的设备开动起来，使机器继续运转。这些都可以减轻工人的劳动强度和减少设备事故。
    这个热电厂从开工建设到第一期工程全部投入生产只用了一年零九个月的时间。土建和安装工程质量都基本上达到了设计要求。
    又讯　北京热电厂第二期建厂工程正在紧张进行。工程完成之后，这个厂的发电能力将比现在提高一倍。
    这个厂二期建厂工程包括主厂房、一台容量更大的汽轮发电机、三台巨大锅炉、对外供电、供热的设备和其他一系列的附属设施。目前，主厂房的工程已经基本完工，汽轮发电机已经开始安装，第一台锅炉也正在联接各种管道。
    同第一期工程一样，二期建厂工程的主要设备也是苏联供应的先进技术装备。其中汽轮发电机是我国目前最大的发电设备。（附图片）
