    Night Tour of Hongze Lake
    Ying Jiesheng
    It was a hazy night. Layers of dark clouds completely obscured the moon. The southeast wind howled, stirring up wave after wave of giant waves on Hongze Lake, like countless wild beasts roaring and crashing against the stone-built embankment. The road built on the long dike, like a pale yellow ribbon, tightly bound the lakeside, winding into the distance. We—myself and County Secretary Wang—left Gaojian Town and strolled along the flat road towards the Erhe Sluice. From afar, the Erhe Sluice looked like a giant dragon coiled on Hongze Lake. We stood on the sluice, leaning against the stone railing, and looked out over Hongze Lake. All around was a vast expanse of white water, and we felt as if we were in the middle of the sea. Standing on the side of the sluice, we looked down at the sluice gate, where dozens of torrents converged into a huge waterfall, rushing fiercely through the gate and down the Huai-Shu New River! The water flowed rapidly, like ten thousand horses galloping, and the sound of surging waves was endless. Just as I was lost in thought, I suddenly heard several shouts of "Heave-ho, heave-ho" beside me. Following the sound, I noticed that there were dozens of dark figures moving towards the center of the lake in front of the right side of the sluice. "Fishing boats!" I exclaimed as if I had discovered something amazing. "Let's go! Let's watch the fishing, it has a special charm at night." Secretary Wang pulled me away without explanation. We bypassed the sluice, crossed several shoals, and walked on the soft sandy soil for about ten minutes before reaching the place where the fishing boats had set sail. It turned out that this was a small village. At the entrance of the village, a Leap Forward gate was built with bricks, with the words "Hongming Commune First New Village" written in dark characters on it. Several rows of neat thatched houses were obviously newly built. In front of the village, the embankment was crescent-shaped, like a natural harbor, and several small boats were moored there. We walked straight to the small boats. Before we got close, Secretary Wang raised his voice:
  "Is Team Leader Zhou there?" Before he finished speaking, a voice replied: "Is that Secretary Wang? Please come over." A figure flashed out of the middle boat, jumped onto the shore in a few strides, and walked towards us at a jogging pace. When I saw him, I couldn't believe that Team Leader Zhou was an old man with white hair in his sixties. His agile movements and a pair of shining eyes showed that he was an old fisherman who had experienced risks and was familiar with fishing operations. Sure enough, after the introduction, I learned that he had been fishing in the lake since he was a child and was already sixty-seven years old this year. He led us to a small boat, and a young man skillfully rowed the oars, and the boat left the port and headed towards the center of the lake. At this time, Team Leader Zhou began to report the production situation in recent days to Secretary Wang in detail. In the past ten days, they had caught more than 60,000 catties of fish and shrimp.
    As the boat was moving, suddenly a screen-like object appeared in front of us, stretching far in a winding manner. Along this object, the boat turned a corner and then another, making it impossible for me to tell which direction we were going. I was about to ask what this was. "Stop! Stop!" Team Leader Zhou waved his hand at the young man rowing the oars. The boat stopped abruptly. He tilted his body slightly, listening attentively, as if something had happened in the water. Then, he picked up an iron fork and thrust it forcefully into the water, lifted it up, and a large black carp weighing more than ten catties was struggling desperately on the fork. He put the fish into the cabin and said with a smile, "It didn't stay in its comfortable nest and entered the maze, and now it wants to escape!"
    I was intrigued by him and couldn't help but ask, "The boat was moving smoothly just now, how did you know there were fish nearby?"
      "It's nothing, fish also have their temper. Like this guy," he pointed to the struggling black carp, "is the most cunning. At the slightest sign of trouble, it will dive from the surface of the water to the bottom. But it's also very stupid. When it dives down, it always has to release a bubble of air. As long as you pay attention to where there are bubbles rising, it's sure to be there."
      "Then what is a maze?"
    "Look, this is it." He pointed to the screen-like object, afraid that I wouldn't understand, and added, "This thing is called a 'dike', and it's made of bamboo. Because it's long and far, winding and twisting, fish will get lost when they come in, so it's called a maze." As he spoke, he used the iron fork to scoop out a bamboo basket from the water. This thing, which is thick in the middle and thin at both ends, has a lid on one end and is covered with barbs on the other. He opened the lid and poured out a lot of fish with a gurgling sound. He told me that this thing can catch dozens of catties of fish day and night.
      The boat continued to move forward along the dike, and soon sailed towards the center of the lake. On the lake, groups of three or five fishing boats appeared faintly in all directions, and shouts and laughter could be heard indistinctly. The further we went, the stronger the wind and the higher the waves, and the more violently the boat swayed. I clung to the cabin, my heart pounding anxiously. Secretary Wang and Team Leader Zhou were talking and laughing, not caring at all. It was late at night, and the clock pointed to twelve. Team Leader Zhou originally wanted to take us to the center of the lake to see the hook and net fishing, but because I had to leave early tomorrow morning, he had to turn the boat around and head back the way we came. Who knew that just as we were turning the boat around, a gust of wind suddenly blew up, and a huge wave lifted our boat four or five feet high. With the rise and fall of the waves, the boat plummeted downwards as if suspended in mid-air, and there was a danger of being capsized by the waves. In the nick of time, just at this critical moment, Team Leader Zhou jumped up, rushed to the young man rowing the oars, grabbed the oars, and following the downward momentum of the waves, swung his arms and rowed, and the boat shot forward like an arrow. This thrilling scene frightened me into a cold sweat, and I couldn't help but ask, "Team Leader Zhou, aren't you afraid of danger with such a big wind and waves?"
      "These little winds and waves are too common, you haven't been on a boat before, so you think it's very dangerous."
      "Then what if you encounter a typhoon?" I asked a little unconvinced:
    "Typhoon? The radio station would have told us long ago."
    "The radio station only reports the weather conditions of the special zone, but it doesn't make weather forecasts specifically for you!"
    "You're talking about the provincial radio station, he's talking about our county's radio station." Secretary Wang interjected. It turned out that the government attached great importance to safe production, stipulated that fishing boats were not allowed to set sail in strong winds and waves, and also specially built a wireless radio station in the county, which made weather forecasts to fishermen every few hours.
    The night grew deeper; the wind had become lighter at some point. A full moon hung high in the sky, shining with a bright light. On the way back, with infinite reluctance, I looked back from time to time: the Erhe Sluice, illuminated by the moonlight, seemed to be covered with a layer of silver gauze, revealing a bit of charm in its majesty; Hongze Lake had turned into a silver sea, sparkling; countless black shadows of fishing boats were lightly and lively shuttling back and forth on the lake.

    夜游洪泽湖
    应节升
    这是一个阴霾的夜晚。重重叠叠的乌云，把月亮遮得严严的。东南风呼呼直吹，把洪泽湖水卷起一层又一层的巨浪，像数不清的猛兽，咆哮着扑向石块砌起来的堤岸。筑在长堤上的公路，像一根淡黄色的丝带，紧紧束在湖畔上，蜿蜒伸向远方。我们——我和县委王书记——出了高涧镇，倚着平坦的公路，信步向二河闸走去。远远望去，二河闸就像一条巨龙盘踞在洪泽湖上。我们站在闸上，倚着石栏杆，眺望洪泽湖。四围是白茫茫一片汪洋，我们恍若置身在大海之中。站在闸的侧面，俯首凝视闸门，只见几十股激流，汇集成一股巨大的瀑布，凶猛地穿过闸门，向淮沭新河下游冲去！水流湍急，有如万马奔腾，汹涌澎湃之声，不绝于耳。我正在出神之际，耳边忽然传来了几声“嗨唷嗨唷”的号子声，循着这声音，我发现就在水闸的右前方，隐隐约约地有好几十个黑影在向湖心蠕动。“渔船！”我像发现了奇事似的惊呼了一下。“走！看看捕鱼去，夜间看捕鱼别有风味哩。”王书记不由分说地拉着我就走。我们绕过水闸，越过几处暗滩，踏着软绵绵的沙土地，约莫走了十来分钟，就到了刚才渔船出帆的地方。原来这里是一个小村子。村头，用砖头砌了一个跃进门，上面写了几个乌黑的大字：洪明公社第一新村。几排整齐的茅屋，一望而知全是新建的。村前，堤岸呈月牙形，宛若一个天然的港口，还有几只小船停泊在那里。我们径向小船走去，还没到跟前，王书记就拉开了嗓门：
  “周队长在吗？”话音未落，那边就搭上了腔：“王书记吗，请过来。”中间的一只小船上，闪出一条人影，只几纵，就跨上了岸，用小跑步的速度，向我们走来，一照面，使我不敢相信，周队长竟是一个白发苍苍、年逾花甲的老头子。他那矫捷的身手和一双闪闪发光的眼睛，显示出他是一个久经风险、熟悉渔业操作的老渔民。果然，经过介绍之后，知道他自幼儿就在湖里捕鱼，今年已经六十七岁了。他把我们领到一只小船上，一个年轻小伙子，熟练地荡开双桨，船便离开港口，向湖心驶去。这时，周队长便开始向王书记一五一十地汇报起近几天的生产情况来。十天里面，他们已经捕了六万多斤鱼虾了。
    船正行驶着，忽然前面出现了一个屏风似的东西，弯弯曲曲地伸展得很远。沿着这东西，小船一会儿拐弯，一会儿抹角，弄得我连方向都辨不出来。我正想问这是什么。“停停！”周队长却向那摇桨的青年一摆手叫了起来。小船戛然停住了。他微侧着身子，谛听着，仿佛水里发生了什么事，跟着，他顺手拿起一根铁叉，用力向水中一插，往上一提，一条足有十来斤重的大青鱼，正在叉子上拼命地挣扎着。他把鱼放进了舱里，笑嘻嘻地说：“放着安乐窝它不去，进了迷魂阵还想溜走！”
    我被他迷惑住了，不禁问：“刚才船行得好好的，您怎么知道附近有鱼？”
      “这没什么，鱼也有它的脾气，像这家伙”，他用手指着还在挣扎的大青鱼“最狡猾，一遇风吹草动，它就从水面上一直钻到水底；不过它也很笨，往下钻的时候，总要吐一口气。只要注意那里有水泡向上翻，它就准在那里。”
      “那么什么叫迷魂阵呢？”
    “喏，这就是。”他指着那屏风似的东西，怕我不懂，又作了补充：“这东西叫簖，是用竹子编起来的，因为它既长又远，弯弯曲曲，鱼儿进来就会迷失方向，所以就叫它迷魂阵。”他一边说一边又用铁叉在水里捞出一个竹篓子来。这个中间
  粗两头细的东西，一头有盖子，一头布满了倒刺。他揭开盖子，咕噜一声，倒出许多鱼来。他告诉我，这东西一昼夜可以捕几十斤鱼。
      小船继续沿着簖向前行，不一会，又驶向了湖心。湖面上，四面八方影影绰绰的出现了三五成群的鱼
  船，欢呼声、嘻笑声隐约可闻。越往前进，风越大，浪越高，小船摇晃得也越厉害。我紧贴着船舱，一颗心忐忑地跳动着，王书记和周队长他们却有说有笑，一点也不在乎。夜深了，时针指向了十二点。周队长本来想把我们送到湖心看看挂钩、张网捕鱼的情形，因为我明天一早还得赶路，只好掉转船头，向来路驶去。谁知，就在拨转船头的时候，蓦地刮起一股疾风，卷起一层巨浪，把我们的小船托起四、五尺高。随着浪头的起伏，小船像悬在半空似的往下直坠，眼看将有被浪头击沉的危险。说时迟那时快，就在这千钧一发之际，只见周队长一纵身，窜到划桨的小伙子跟前，夺过双桨，顺着浪头下沉之势，振臂一划，小船就像箭一样向前穿去。这个惊险的场面，吓得我一身冷汗，我再忍不住问：“周队长，这么大的风浪，你们不怕危险？”
      “这么点点风浪太平常了，您没坐过船，所以觉得很危险。”
      “那万一遇上台风呢？”我有点不服气的问：
    “台风？那广播电台早就告诉我们啦。”
    “电台只报告专区的气候情况，可没单独为你们作天气预报呀！”
    “您说的是省里的电台，他说的是咱们县里的电台。”王书记接过去说了。原来政府很重视安全生产，规定了在大风浪中不许出帆捕鱼，并且还特地在县里建了一个无线广播电台，每隔几个钟点，就向渔民作一次气候预报。
    夜，更深了；风，不知什么时候变得轻了起来。一轮满月，高悬天空，射出皎洁的光芒。归途中，怀着无限依恋的心情，我不时地向后望望：二河闸被月色一照，像披上一层银色的轻纱，雄峻中透露出几分妩媚；洪泽湖变成了银海，闪闪发光；数不清的渔船黑影，正轻捷活泼地在湖面上穿来穿去。
