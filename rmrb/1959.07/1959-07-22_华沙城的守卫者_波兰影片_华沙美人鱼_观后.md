    Guardians of Warsaw
    ——After Watching the Polish Film "The Mermaid of Warsaw"
    Tan Ye
    A long, long time ago, in the village of Rubaki on the banks of the Vistula River, lived a young couple deeply in love. The man was named Was, a brave and clever blacksmith, and the woman was named Sawa, so gentle, beautiful, and kind. However, their pure love was met with jealousy and hatred from Sawa's stepmother, the witch Kubelicha, and the water monster living in the Vistula River. Because "the prophecy says that on the banks of the Vistula, the day a village blacksmith marries a witch's stepdaughter, the mermaid will drive away the water monster, and a great city will be built there. The one who officiates the wedding will be the guardian of that city." Therefore, they tried everything to sabotage the union of Was and Sawa.
    The river god of the Mesozoic plain - the mermaid, living in a small spring in the forest not far from Rubaki village - sang her beautiful and melodious song every time Kubelicha used magic to destroy the love of this couple, awakening the kind hearts that had been tempted by the witch. Time and again, she exposed the witch's conspiracies.
    Of course, the wonderful singing also provoked a more ferocious counterattack from the witch and the water monster. The water monster first directed Kubelicha to bewitch Was, and when this trick failed, he used greedy merchants to kidnap and sell the mermaid, and pushed Sawa into the river to enslave her. The situation was already very critical. At this time, Was asked the mermaid for help, but the mermaid was only the embodiment of truth, goodness, and beauty. As she herself said, "Beauty and goodness, if lacking strength, are also weak and incompetent." Only when Was armed the mermaid with the wisdom of mankind and the crystallization of labor—sword and shield—can truth, goodness, and beauty overcome evil.
    Through the struggle of Was and the mermaid, the water monster was finally driven away, and Sawa was rescued. The mermaid officiated the wedding of Was and Sawa, the prophecy was fulfilled, and the residents on both sides of the Vistula River were no longer harassed and harmed by the water monster, living a peaceful and prosperous life. And the mermaid became the guardian of Warsaw, the city built on the banks of the Vistula River.
    Although the story of "The Mermaid of Warsaw" is very simple, it is full of rich poetic and artistic flavor and expresses profound life philosophy. It is an ode. It sings the praises of faithful love, praises of sincere friendship, praises of the inevitable victory of light over darkness, praises of the ultimate victory of good over evil, and praises of the power to win and the determination to fight.
    The film also gives kind lashes to the various weaknesses in people. We see the hermit who wholeheartedly wants to become a "university scholar" being vividly ridiculed; and didn't that fast-talking horse Maciek also get his due lesson; Was, who was temporarily blinded by fame and reputation, was also criticized. Even the Slavs, who were cowardly to the extreme, could not help but be lashed with tears, revealing a sense of pity. The film is full of confidence in people, people are the masters of the world. Although people still have various weaknesses, people finally overcome the demons and ghosts. Isn't it true that all demons and monsters can only use the weaknesses of people themselves to manipulate people! Let us wash our bodies clean with water and not let any enemies take advantage of our weaknesses. This is precisely the realistic significance of filming and showing this film.
    This film has its unique style. Freshness, elegance, and liveliness are its style. We know that Poland is a cheerful and humorous nation. In the film, we will be amused by some legendary plots at any time, and we will be educated and understand the truth in this relaxed and joyful laughter.
    For many years, the "Mermaid of Warsaw" with a shield in one hand and a sword in the other has been the symbol of the Polish capital, Warsaw. This embodiment of kindness and strength protects the people of Warsaw day and night, living a happy life, and singing a truly beautiful song from the hearts of every Warsaw resident!

    华沙城的守卫者
    ——波兰影片“华沙美人鱼”观后
    谭冶
    很久很久以前，在维斯杜拉河的岸边鲁巴基村庄里，住着一对正相爱着的青年男女。男的叫做华士，是一个勇敢而聪明的铁匠，女的名叫沙娃，她是那么的温柔，美丽而善良，然而，他们纯洁的爱情却遭到沙娃的继母巫婆库贝利查和住在维斯杜拉河的水怪的妒嫉和仇恨。因为“预言说，在维斯杜拉河岸上，当乡村铁匠跟一个巫婆的继女儿结婚的那天，美人鱼就会把水怪赶走，在那儿将建立一座大城市。那一位证婚人就是那座城市的守护神。”所以他们想尽了一切办法来破坏华士和沙娃的结合。
    住在离鲁巴基村不远森林中小水泉里的美索纹平原的河神——美人鱼在库贝利查每次施用魔术破坏这一对青年的爱情的时候，就唱起她那优美动听的歌儿，唤醒那些被巫婆诱惑的善良的心。一次再次的揭露了巫婆的阴谋诡计。
    当然美妙的歌声同时也激起巫婆和水怪更凶恶的反扑。水怪先是指使库贝利查迷惑华士，这个诡计不成，又利用贪婪的商人把美人鱼捆走卖掉，并把沙娃推下河去，占做奴隶。情况已经十分危急了，这时，华士向美人鱼求援，但是，美人鱼只是真善美的化身，正像她自己所说的那样：“美丽和善良，如果缺少力量，也是软弱无能的。”只有当华士用人类的智慧和劳动的结晶——剑和盾武装起美人鱼的时候，真善美才能战胜邪恶。
    经过华士和美人鱼的斗争，最后赶走了水怪，救出了沙娃。美人鱼作了华士和沙娃的证婚人，预言实现了，维斯杜拉河两畔的居民再也不受水怪的骚扰和残害。过着安居乐业的生活。而美人鱼也成了维斯杜拉河畔兴建起来的城市——华沙的守护神。
      “华沙美人鱼”的故事虽然很简单，但却充满了浓厚的诗情画意，而且表现了深刻的人生哲理。它是一首颂诗。歌颂了忠贞的爱情，歌颂了诚实的友谊，歌颂了光明必定战胜黑暗，歌颂了善良终于战胜邪恶，歌颂了取得胜利的力量和坚强的斗志。
    对于人身上的各式各样的弱点，影片也给予善意的鞭斥。我们看到了那位一心一意想当“大学士”的隐士受到了生动的讥讽；而那个快嘴快舌的马茜克不也得到了应有的教训了；一时被名誉、名望所迷惑的华士也挨了批评。就是对那懦弱到极点的斯拉夫，也不免带着眼泪去鞭挞他们，而流露出怜惜之情。影片对人充满了信心，人是世界的主人。尽管人还有各式各样的弱点，人终于战胜了妖魔鬼怪。不是一切魑魅魍魉，也只能利用人本身的弱点来玩弄人吗！让我们用水把我们身体洗得干干净净吧，不让任何的敌人钻我们的空子。正是拍摄和放映这个片子的现实意义。
    这部片子有它独特的风格。清新，俊逸和活泼就正是它的风格。我们知道波兰是一个快活而富于幽默的民族。在影片中我们随时都会被一些传奇式的情节逗得发笑，而且就在这种轻松、愉快的笑声中受到了教育，懂得了真理。
    多少年来，一手举盾一手执剑的“华沙美人鱼”一直做着波兰首都华沙的标志。这个善良和力量的化身日日夜夜保护着华沙人民过着幸福的生活，从每个华沙人心灵中唱出来真正的优美的歌声！
