Tens of Thousands of Construction Workers Open Up a Base Deep in the Old Forest

(Our dispatch) Several tens of thousands of development and construction workers are opening up new logging bases deep in the primeval forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains to increase timber production.

For the past two or three months, in those newly developed forest areas, the mountains have been filled with the sound of logging and the crashing of towering trees; at the foot of the mountains, there is the roar of bulldozers, the sound of shovels and picks, and the valley-shaking sound of blasting. The vigorous music played by the development and construction army has awakened the ancient primeval forest to serve the country's socialist construction. Five newly developed forestry bureaus, which combine construction and operation, have now obtained 140,000 cubic meters of timber. More than a dozen other old forestry bureaus are also continuing to open up new or expand old logging sites; railway and highway projects for transporting timber to these new forestry bureaus and logging sites are under construction at an accelerated pace. The subgrade work for the three major railways built by the Ministry of Railways has been completed for more than 150 kilometers; the four narrow-gauge forest railways built by the forestry system have completed 60 kilometers of subgrade work, and eight forest highways have completed more than 100 kilometers. More than 34,000 square meters of office buildings and dormitories have been built in these new forestry bureaus and forest farms. At present, the amount of investment in basic construction completed by the forestry system alone has doubled compared with the same period last year.

All construction units have extensively launched the movement to increase production and practice economy. Party committees have been closely monitoring the ideological education of workers, especially temporary workers; and they have organized leading cadres to inspect and guide key projects. The "two participations, three combinations" system has been widely implemented among cadres and workers, and socialist labor competitions have been extensively launched. More than 16,000 employees of the Hulunbuir League Road Construction Engineering Bureau, which contracted the forestry system's projects, have continuously created excellent results, completing two days' worth of work in one day. Some employees have proposed rationalization suggestions to modify some designs, saving a lot of earth and stone work. Zhou Tuhao, a Communist Youth League member and technician at the Hailar Railway Engineering Bureau, saved more than 60,000 yuan after his suggestions for modifying the curvature of the line were adopted.

The socialist labor competitions launched by various construction units are all centered on technological innovation, with the aim of increasing labor productivity. Now, bulldozers, road rollers, pile drivers, or soil trucks, wooden rail flatcars, aerial flying boxes, short-distance swing soil baskets, and other new tools are used on various construction sites to replace manual labor such as carrying on shoulders and a considerable part of manual ramming. Since carpenters could not make new tools fast enough, the Hulunbuir League Road Construction Engineering Bureau mobilized workers to manufacture more than 9,000 pieces of equipment such as bulldozer trucks. After the engineering bureau launched a technological innovation campaign, production efficiency in early June increased by 35.5% compared with May.

In the construction process, the workers also overcame difficult and dangerous areas and accelerated the progress. When the railway was built to Shangyouling, which is surrounded by mountains on three sides, nearly 2,000 road builders launched a battle to move mountains and fill valleys. The 250,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work, originally scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, will now be completed two months ahead of schedule. (Bai Hao) (Attached picture)

### 建设大军数万名  老林深处辟基地

    建设大军数万名
    老林深处辟基地
    本报讯　数万名开发建设大军，正在大兴安岭原始森林深处为增产木材开辟新的采伐基地。
    两三个月以来，在那些新开发的林区里，山上是一片伐木声和参天巨木的倾倒声；山下是推土机的马达声、锹镐声和震撼山谷的爆破声。开发建设大军奏起的这支铿锵的乐章唤醒了古老的原始森林，来为祖国的社会主义建设服务。五个新的采伐兼营林的林业局边建设边生产，现在已拿到十四万立方米木材。其他十多个老的林业局也在继续开辟新的或扩大旧有的采伐林场；通往这些新林业局和采伐地段的运材铁路和公路工程正在加紧施工。铁道部修建的三条大铁路的路基工程已经完成了一百五十多公里；林业系统修建的四条窄轨森林铁路已完成六十公里的路基工程，八条森林公路已经完成一百多公里。在这些新的林业局和林场上修建的办公室和宿舍等建筑已有三万四千多平方米。现在，仅林业系统完成的基本建设投资额就比去年同期增长一倍。
    各工程单位都广泛开展了增产节约运动。党委都抓紧了对职工特别是临时工人的思想教育工作；并且组织领导干部到重点工程检查、指导。在干部和工人中普遍推行了两参三结合的制度，并且广泛开展了社会主义劳动竞赛。承包林业系统工程的呼伦贝尔盟筑路工程局一万六千多名职工，不断创造了一天完成两天的计划的优异成绩。有些职工提出修改部分设计的合理化建议，节省了很多土石方。海拉尔铁路工程局共青团员技术员周图浩提出的修改线路弯度等建议被采纳以后，共节约造价六万多元。
    各工程单位开展的社会主义劳动竞赛都以技术革新为中心，以提高劳动生产率为目的。现在各工地使用了推土机、压路机、打桩机或土车、木轨平车、空中飞箱、短距秋千运土篮等新工具，代替了肩挑和相当一部分人力打夯等劳动。新工具靠木工一时造不过来，呼伦贝尔盟筑路工程局就发动工人造了推土车等九千多件。这个工程局开展技术革新运动以后，6月上旬比5月份生产效率提高35.5％。
    在施工中，职工们还战胜艰险地带，加速进程。铁路修到上游岭，三面环山，近二千名筑路工展开了移山填谷的战斗，二十五万多土石方工程，原订年底完成，现在要提前两个月完成。　（白皓）（附图片）
