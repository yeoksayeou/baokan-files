Strengthening Ties with Local Areas, Learning from the People
Li Fuyao, Director of the Political Department of the Zhanjiang Garrison

The Party and Chairman Mao have consistently taught us that the army must maintain close ties with the people, constantly learn from them, and draw "nutrition" from them to educate and improve ourselves. However, speaking from the specific situation of our unit, since moving into the barracks, for a period of time, our connection with the people has clearly weakened compared to the past war years, and the concept of learning from the people has also become less strong.

The Party Committee and political organs of our unit promptly noticed this problem and considered that this was not a small issue, but a fundamental issue of army building. They considered that close contact with the people was of particular importance for defending the motherland's coastal defense and educating and improving the ideological consciousness of the troops. We were determined to change this situation. To this end, the Party Committee and political organs did a lot of ideological and organizational work. On the one hand, we repeatedly educated the officers and soldiers of the unit on the fine traditions of the People's Army, especially on relying on the people, connecting with the people, and learning from the people; at the same time, we criticized ideological viewpoints that neglected the essence of the People's Army. At this time, we also actively sought new measures and methods for contacting and learning from the masses in the new environment and conditions. In the winter of 1956, Chairman Mao issued a call to the whole Party and the people of the whole country to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1957. The Party Committee of the unit realized that this was a favorable opportunity, and based on the situation of cadres and work at that time, it extracted more than 800 cadres as soon as possible to form work teams and sent them to the rural areas of eleven counties near the garrison to participate in production and work for a relatively long period of time. The purpose of doing this was, on the one hand, to educate the cadres, and on the other hand, to find methods and experiences for contacting the people in the future. Practice has proved that the effect is very good. Therefore, the leadership's confidence and determination were further enhanced. Since then, we have regularly sent large numbers of cadres to the countryside to engage in production work and study in different ways. At the same time, our leading comrades also consciously and actively participated in the work of the local Party committees to learn from their work experience. Since the emergence of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes in 1958, a strong political atmosphere of close contact with the people and learning from the people has been formed in the troops, and the methods of learning have become more and more numerous.

Strengthening ties with the people and earnestly learning from them has achieved good results. The most important gain is that through these activities, leaders at all levels and the broad masses of officers and soldiers have been able to understand the current rural situation and development trends in a timely and profound manner, thereby further deepening their understanding of the Party's policies and greatly improving the political and ideological awareness and understanding of the officers and soldiers, and inspiring their political enthusiasm and revolutionary initiative. In addition, the relationship between the military and the government and between the military and the people has become even closer.

Facts have given us the most profound enlightenment. From the practice of the past few years, we have increasingly deeply realized that: close contact with the people, constant learning from the people, and drawing strength from the struggle of the people is always a fundamental task of our army's political and ideological work. Not only was it necessary to do so in the past war years, but it is also necessary and fully possible to do so in today's environment and conditions; even in the future, as long as our People's Army exists for one day, this principle will never change. As for methods, time, and energy, etc., they are relatively easy to solve. As long as we truly attach importance to it ideologically, we will have methods, time, and energy. Perhaps there will be such a question: will it affect troop training and the execution of tasks? Our view is that as long as the leadership makes unified plans and appropriate arrangements, the problem can be solved. To take a step back, even if it affects some other work, the resulting improvement in ideological awareness and the enhancement of political enthusiasm will be invaluable to the People's Army.

    加强同地方的联系　向人民群众学习
    湛江驻军政治部主任　李福尧
    党和毛主席一贯地教导我们：军队必须和人民群众保持密切的联系，不断地向人民群众学习，从人民群众中吸取“营养”来教育和提高自己。但是，从我部具体情况来说，自从进驻营房以后，有一个时期，和人民群众的联系，显然比过去战争年代减弱了，向人民群众学习的观念也不那么强烈了。
    我部党委和政治机关及时地注意到了这个问题，并且考虑到这不是一个小问题，而是军队建设的一个根本问题，考虑到和人民群众紧密联系，对于保卫祖国海防、教育和提高部队的思想觉悟有特殊重要的意义。我们决心着手改变这种情况。为此，党委和政治机关作了许多思想工作和组织工作。一方面向部队官兵反复地进行了人民军队优良传统的教育，特别是依靠人民群众、联系人民群众、向人民群众学习的教育；同时，对忽视人民军队本质的思想观点，作了批判。在这个时候，我们又积极寻求在新的环境和条件下，联系群众、向群众学习的新的措施和方法。1956年冬，毛主席向全党和全国人民发出了争取1957年农业大丰收的号召。部队党委意识到这是一个有利时机，便根据当时干部和工作的情况，尽可能地及时抽出了八百多名干部组成工作队，派到驻地附近十一个县的农村去，较长期地参加生产和工作。这样做的目的，一方面是为了教育干部，同时也为了寻找今后联系人民群众的方法和经验。实践证明效果很好。于是领导上的信心和决心更增强了。从此以后，我们就经常不断地派出大批的干部，采取不同方式到农村去生产工作和学习。同时，我们领导同志也有意识地主动参加地方党委的工作，从中学习工作经验。1958年大跃进的局面和人民公社出现以来，在部队中，和人民群众紧密联系、向人民群众学习，更形成了一种浓厚的政治空气，学习的方法也越来越多了。
    加强同人民群众的联系，认真地向人民群众学习，已经获得了良好的效果。最主要的收获是通过这些活动，使各级领导和广大官兵，及时地、深刻地了解当前农村的形势和发展趋向，从而进一步地加深了对党的方针政策的理解，大大提高了部队官兵政治思想觉悟和认识水平，鼓舞了政治热情和革命积极性。此外，军政之间、军民之间的关系也更加亲密了。
    事实给了我们最深刻的教益。从几年来的实践中，我们愈来愈深切地体会到这样一点：和人民群众紧密联系，不断地向人民群众学习，从人民群众的斗争中吸取力量，永远是我军政治思想工作的一项根本任务，不仅过去战争年代要这样做，在今天的环境和条件下同样也需要这样做，而且完全能这样做；即使到将来，只要我们人民军队还存在一天，这个原则也决不会改变。至于方法、时间和精力等等，都比较容易解决。只要思想上真正重视了，方法也就有了，时间也就有了，精力也能发挥出来了。也许会有这样的疑问：会不会影响部队训练和执行任务呢？我们的看法是：只要领导上统一筹划，适当安排，问题就能得到解决。退一步说，即使影响一些其他的工作，但由此而得到的思想觉悟的提高和政治积极性的增强，将是人民军队的无价之宝。
