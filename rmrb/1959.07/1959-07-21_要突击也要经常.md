Short Commentary:

	To achieve the arduous task of eliminating pests and diseases, we must, according to the seasonal characteristics, put forward different requirements for different seasons and launch necessary hygiene crash programs. Moreover, on the basis of mass movements, we must do a good job of regular hygiene work.

	Experiences in various places show that launching hygiene crash programs can, in a short period of time, mobilize the masses, concentrate forces, and eliminate large numbers of the "four pests" in large areas, as well as eliminate the breeding conditions of the "four pests." Therefore, it is necessary to propose key hygiene tasks and crash program goals according to seasonal characteristics, such as eliminating breeding conditions and "striking early and small" in winter and spring; focusing on mosquito and fly eradication and eliminating vectors of infectious diseases in summer and autumn, and paying attention to food hygiene, etc. Now, as the weather is hot and mosquitoes and flies breed, it is necessary to carry out a patriotic hygiene movement centered on fly eradication and disease prevention to ensure the health of the people. Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Anhui, Jilin and other provinces and cities are vigorously engaged in such programs. This is a timely action to eliminate pests and diseases.

	However, eliminating pests and diseases is a long-term struggle. Therefore, on the other hand, regular hygiene work must also be grasped well. Some places have paid attention to crash programs but relaxed regular work. This has become a weak link that must be overcome in the patriotic hygiene movement.

	The key to doing a good job of regular hygiene work lies in proposing practical and feasible methods with emphasis; and making comprehensive and reasonable arrangements for it together with other tasks. Practice has proved that places that attach importance to regular hygiene work and arrange it well can not only persevere but also achieve significant results. The residents of Nanbei Chang Street in Beijing have been able to maintain the title of "Hygiene Red Flag" for seven years, which is a good example. Similar experiences exist in many urban and rural areas and are worth summarizing and promoting.

### 要突击也要经常

    要突击也要经常
    要实现除害灭病的艰巨任务，就要根据季节性的特点，针对不同的季节，提出不同的要求，展开必要的卫生突击运动。并且，要在群众运动的基础上，作好经常性的卫生工作。
    各地的经验说明，展开卫生突击运动，能够在较短的时间内，发动群众，集中力量，在大片地区大量地扑灭四害，并消灭四害的孳生条件。所以，必须根据季节性的特点，提出卫生工作重点和突击目标，如冬春季节，主要是消灭孳生的条件，“打小打早”；夏秋季节，主要是扑蝇灭蚊，消灭传染疾病的媒介，并注意饮食卫生等等。现在，正当天气炎热，蚊蝇丛生，必须开展一个灭蝇防病为中心的爱国卫生运动，确保人民群众的身体健康。北京、天津、上海、安徽、吉林等省、市正在大力突击。这是除害灭病的适时行动。
    但是，除害灭病是一个长期的斗争。因此，另一方面，经常性的卫生工作，也要很好抓紧。有些地方注意了突击运动，却放松了经常工作，这就成了爱国卫生运动中必须克服的薄弱环节。
    做好经常性卫生工作的关键，在于有重点地提出切实可行的办法；并把它同其他各项工作作出全面的合理的安排。实践证明，凡是重视经常性的卫生工作，并把它安排得好的地方，既能够坚持下去，又能够收到显著的成效。北京市南北长街居民所以能够保持了七年卫生红旗，就是一个很好的例子。类似这样的经验，许多城乡都有，值得总结和推广。
