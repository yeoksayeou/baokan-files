    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 3rd. The Central Executive Committee of the Indian Communist Party passed a resolution on the 1st, criticizing the resolution passed by the Congress Party Parliamentary Committee on June 29th, which called for a new election in Kerala.

    The resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Indian Communist Party stated that the demand for re-election does not apply to the other thirteen states in India or the central government, which shows that the Congress Party Parliamentary Committee is "applying one standard to Kerala, which is governed by a non-Congress party, and another standard to the states and the central government governed by the Congress Party."

    The resolution stated that it is evident that even at this stage, the national leadership of the Congress Party still hopes that local Congress Party leaders will take the approach of "direct action" in order to create an excuse for the central government to intervene.

    The five-day meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the Indian Communist Party was held in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala, and ended on the 1st.

    Indian Communist Party General Secretary Ghosh, in a signed editorial in the latest issue of the "New Century" weekly, refuted the arguments of the Congress Party Parliamentary Committee resolution. He pointed out that the Congress Party's demand for a new election in Kerala is aimed at overthrowing the Kerala government. Ghosh wrote that the resolution of the Congress Party Parliamentary Committee will deeply shock those who are hoping that it will uphold the Indian Constitution.

    Regarding the Congress Party's request for an investigation into the Kerala police shooting incident, Ghosh said,
  "When police killings occurred in Bombay, Ahmedabad, and Punjab, where did the Parliamentary Committee go? Why didn't it instruct its government to immediately conduct a judicial investigation?"

    Ghosh said that the Congress Party's "resolution does not contain a single word against violent activities aimed at undermining the state government and creating complete chaos," and "actually approves of the alliance and tactics of the Kerala Congress Party (with other opposition parties), which has aroused condemnation from many people across India who have nothing to do with the Communist Party."

    According to a report in the "Statesman" on the 2nd, the chairman of the Kerala State Committee of the Congress Party, Shankar, and others, after attending the Congress Party Parliamentary Committee meeting in Delhi, returned to Trivandrum and issued a statement on the 1st, calling on the people in Kerala to fight "for an immediate election in the state." At the same time, the opposition in Kerala incited some people to continue their activities against the state government.

### 印度共产党中央执委会通过决议  批评国大党要喀拉拉邦重新大选的主张

    印度共产党中央执委会通过决议
    批评国大党要喀拉拉邦重新大选的主张
    新华社新德里3日电　印度共产党中央执行委员会在1日通过了决议，批评国大党议会委员会在6月29日通过的关于要求在喀拉拉邦重新举行大选的决议。
    印度共产党中央执行委员会的决议说，重新举行大选的要求并不准备适用于印度的其它十三个邦或者中央政府，这就表明，国大党议会委员会对“非国大党执政的喀拉拉邦采用的是一种标准，而对国大党执政的各邦和中央又是另一种标准”。
    决议说，显而易见，甚至在这个阶段，国大党的全国领导机构还希望地方上的国大党领导人采取那种“直接行动”的方式，以便为中央政府进行干涉制造借口。
    印度共产党中央执行委员会为期五天的会议是在喀拉拉邦首府特里凡得琅举行的，会议已经在1日结束。
    印度共产党总书记高士在最近一期的“新世纪”周报上发表一篇署名的社论中反驳了国大党议会委员会决议的论点。他指出，国大党提出的在喀拉拉邦内重新举行大选的要求，目的是想推翻喀拉拉邦政府。高士写道，国大党议会委员会的决议将使那些正在希望它会维护印度宪法的人深为震惊。
    关于国大党提出的调查喀拉拉邦警察开枪事件的要求，高士说，
  “当孟买、阿麦达巴、旁遮普发生警察杀人事件的时候，议会委员会到那里去了？它为什么不指示它的政府立即进行司法调查？”
    高士说，国大党的“决议没有一个字是反对目的在于搞垮邦政府和制造完全混乱的暴力活动”，并且“实际上赞成喀拉拉邦国大党（同其他反对派）的联盟和策略，这种联盟和策略已经引起了印度全国各地许多同共产党决没有什么关系的人们的谴责”。
    据“政治家报”2日报道，国大党喀拉拉邦委员会主席山卡尔等人在德里参加了国大党议会委员会会议以后，回到特里凡得琅，他们在1日发表声明，要求喀拉拉邦内的人们“为了在邦内立即举行大选”而斗争。同时，喀拉拉邦内反对派煽动一些人继续在进行反对邦政府的活动。
