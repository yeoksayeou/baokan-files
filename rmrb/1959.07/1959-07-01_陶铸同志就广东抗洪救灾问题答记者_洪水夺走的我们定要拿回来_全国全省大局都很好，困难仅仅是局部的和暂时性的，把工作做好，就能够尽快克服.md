Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th - Guangdong Province's flood control struggle has lasted for more than half a month; some counties in the Dongjiang River basin have been affected by the disaster. What is the situation of this struggle? How to quickly change the face of the disaster area? What impact will this flood have on the people's economic life? Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed Comrade Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, about this. Comrade Tao Zhu answered the following questions.

Question: What is the situation of the flood control struggle in the province? Why couldn't the extraordinary flood in the Dongjiang River be controlled, leading to flooding?

Answer: Today, the province's flood control struggle has come to a victorious conclusion. This was a very fierce battle. Party and government leaders, the vast number of cadres, and the people in various regions carried out a heroic and tenacious fight, going through all kinds of hardships and risking their lives. I would like to express my sincere condolences on behalf of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee. In particular, the People's Liberation Army stationed in this province made outstanding contributions to the struggle. The people in the disaster area are spreading their praises everywhere, and we are deeply grateful. The floods that occurred in the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers this time were the largest in several years. Compared with the two major floods in 1949 and 1915, when the flood peaks converged at Sixianjiao, the flow rate was not as large as those two years, but the water level below Sixianjiao was not only higher than in 1949, but also higher than in 1915. This is because in those two years, the embankments along the river below Sixianjiao collapsed one after another, so the downstream water force was weakened. However, in those two years, almost all the embankments in the Pearl River Delta collapsed. This time, we resisted it. We have basically grasped the laws of this kind of flood. In the nine years since liberation, we have systematically built water conservancy projects, which have played their due role this time, so we are confident to overcome it; through the efforts of the vast number of cadres and the masses, we have indeed overcome it. However, the situation in the Dongjiang River basin is different. The flood that occurred in the Dongjiang River basin is the largest flood since hydrological records began. Under our existing conditions, it is still impossible to resist it; therefore, after great efforts, this disaster was still unavoidable.

Regarding the flood that occurred in the Dongjiang River basin this time, it can be said that we had envisioned it, but we did not envision its severity. It can also be said that we did not expect a flood as large as this time at all. The Dongjiang River is prone to disasters, with major floods almost every other year. It is necessary to vigorously change this bad situation. This point was envisioned long ago. Therefore, since liberation, we have built and renovated a large number of mountain ponds, reservoirs, canals, and embankments year by year; and since last year, we have been building the Xinfengjiang Reservoir (power station) on the largest tributary of the Dongjiang River - the Xinfengjiang River. The Xinfengjiang Reservoir is not only for power generation, but also for flood control. The Xinfengjiang River basin accounts for 6,000 square kilometers of the Dongjiang River basin, and it has always been the center of rainstorms. The Xinfengjiang Reservoir can control 40% of the floodwaters in the Dongjiang River basin above Huiyang City. This reservoir has not yet been completed and cannot play a role in this flood. Otherwise, the situation would be much better.

Why do we say that we did not expect it? Because this flood exceeded the records since hydrological records began. This shows that it is extremely difficult to grasp the laws of nature, especially the laws of astronomy and meteorology. In the past, our water conservancy construction along rivers and rivers was to ensure that the highest flood level in history would not overflow and breach the banks. However, from June 11th to 15th, within five days, 300 to 500 millimeters of rain fell in the Dongjiang River basin and its surrounding twelve counties, of which more than 600 millimeters of rain fell in the eight counties in the rainstorm zone. The Dongjiang River basin has numerous tributaries and a large ground catchment area. As a result, an extraordinary flood exceeding the hydrological records occurred. The water level of the Dongjiang River near Huiyang City was as high as 17.57 meters, which was 1.48 meters higher than the highest water level of 16.09 meters in 1947 since hydrological records began. Under the attack of such a large and fierce flood, it is impossible for today's manpower to recover the breaches and overflows of the embankments along the river. This is what we did not expect.

Question: Can such a large flood as the one that erupted in the Dongjiang River this time be overcome in the future?

Answer: This is certain. One experience, one lesson. After this major flood, our knowledge of the laws of nature has increased, so we may be able to overcome it. We have this power, and we will definitely do it this way. After the completion of the Xinfengjiang Reservoir next year, in addition to power generation and irrigation, it can play a great role in controlling the Dongjiang River flood. In order to fundamentally change the situation of the Dongjiang River being prone to disasters, we are planning to build the Tonghu flood diversion project in Huiyang County in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River, and we also plan to build the Huangtian Reservoir in Heyuan County in the upper reaches of the Dongjiang River. With these huge projects, supplemented by a large number of other water conservancy projects that have been built, the Dongjiang River flood can be resisted even if it is a little bigger.

This time, Guangzhou City and the Pearl River Delta were preserved. The Hanjiang River basin in the Shantou area was also preserved. This is because in these places, we have more knowledge of the laws of floods and have done a good job in water conservancy. We have been adding repairs to the Beijiang River embankment, which protects Guangzhou and the eastern part of the Pearl River Delta, every year, investing a total of 13 million yuan to build this 120-mile flood control embankment into a city wall. Last year, we added a one-meter-high wave-proof stone wall to the 100-mile flood control embankment. Although Guangzhou does not have feudal city walls, it has such a flood control city wall. With this city wall, even if it is a flood that occurs once in a century, the safety of Guangzhou City will not be a problem. We also plan to build the Lianjiangkou Reservoir and the Huajiang flood diversion project in the upper reaches of the Beijiang River. In the Xijiang River, we are also planning to build the Sanrongxia Reservoir in Gaoao County. After these plans are completed, and supplemented by other water conservancy projects, the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers can be tamed.

In short, as long as we master the laws of nature and continue to build water conservancy projects, we can control the destructive effects of natural forces and make them benefit mankind. We have the confidence and the power to do it, and we will definitely be able to do it, and we must do it.

Question: How do you estimate the disaster situation this time?

Answer: This flood is the largest one in Guangdong Province since liberation. The losses are great. According to the preliminary figures reported from various places, more than 4.7 million mu of early rice have been flooded, about 1.08 million mu of peanuts, sugarcane, jute, and other economic crops have been flooded, 160,000 mu of late rice seedlings have been flooded and submerged, about 100,000 mu of fish ponds have been flooded, and more than 200,000 houses have collapsed. More than 28,000 large and small water conservancy projects have been washed away or damaged, and the affected population has reached 2 million. 187 cadres and people were washed away and died due to the collapse of houses or failure to rescue them in time. 29 people are missing and 204 people were injured. Such serious losses, if it were in the Kuomintang reactionary rule before liberation, it would not be known how many years it would take to recover. It is not known how many people would be displaced, sell their children and daughters, and beg for food. However, we not only have the confidence to let the people rebuild their homes, but also to basically eliminate the traces of the flood after the autumn harvest. Isn't this a miracle? Yes! We are going to create miracles, and we will definitely be able to do it! Because we have a party that serves the people, a state of proletarian dictatorship, people's communes with unlimited vitality, and we are in an era of great leap forward, so the brave and hardworking people have no insurmountable difficulties. This is not only something that the reactionary rule in the past could not do, but also something that cannot be done in capitalist countries, but we will definitely be able to do it.

Question: So, what measures should be taken to change the face of the disaster area?

Answer: We say that we have the power to quickly change the face of the disaster area. First of all, we have the cordial care and strong support of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. During the flood control struggle and disaster area rescue, the State Council has already allocated 10 million yuan and 50 million jin of rice. The central government will also allocate a larger amount of funds and materials to support the disaster area in production for self-rescue, rebuild their homes, and repair water conservancy. The province will also do its best to come up with strength to lead the disaster area to resume production and comprehensively arrange life, including food, housing, seeds, farming cattle, farm tools, pots, bowls, basins, spoons, and so on. The biggest difficulty is housing. With 200,000 houses collapsed, it is impossible to restore them all at once. Even if there are so many materials, there are not so many labors. The current emergency measures are to build sheds, and at the same time repair some of the houses that can be repaired, to ensure that no household is sleeping in the open, and to improve the situation where people are living too crowded and only sheltering from the wind and rain because of temporary placement, so that the people in the disaster area can stabilize their lives and muster their enthusiasm to engage in production. After the summer harvest and summer planting, we can prepare to build houses, first build a part; after the autumn harvest, we will build a large scale, and strive to basically complete the construction before the Spring Festival next year, and it must be built more solidly than before the flood. All material costs are covered by the state.

The assistance from the central government and the province is a strong guarantee for the recovery of the disaster area, but the most important thing is still the self-reliance and hard work of the people in the disaster area. Production for self-rescue has always been the only correct policy. The general requirement is to strive for an exceptionally large harvest of late rice. What nature has taken away from us, we must take back from nature. At present, except for a very few villages, the floods have receded, and the lives of the victims have been settled. If we make another effort to improve the housing situation, and the masses have food and housing, then we will have the prerequisites for restoring production. Now, the replanting and rush planting work in the disaster area is progressing rapidly, which is an extremely gratifying phenomenon. Many people's communes have put forward heroic slogans such as "one crop yields two crops" and "one crop equals one year", striving to plant more on the one hand and striving for high yields on the other. Due to the favorable production conditions for late rice, as long as we make double efforts, with the strong support of the country, this goal can be achieved. All disaster areas must first focus on production, engage in production while arranging life; when the late rice production is almost done and there is a bumper harvest, we will definitely be able to come up with great strength to quickly rebuild our homes.

Question: What impact will this flood have on the economic life of the people in urban and rural areas of this province?

Answer: Since it is a major disaster with great losses, it will naturally have a certain impact on the people's economic life and bring certain difficulties. However, since the overall situation of the country and the province is very good, these difficulties are only local and temporary, and if we do our work well, we can overcome them as soon as possible.

Now, what the people in urban and rural areas are concerned about is: What will be the situation of food supply after the disaster? What will be the situation of vegetable and other non-staple food supplies? Regarding the food supply issue in the second half of the year, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have already announced the policy and made regulations, and things will be done as they are. After this flood, the loss of early rice production is indeed very large. More than 2 million mu of land were completely lost, 2 million mu of land had reduced yields, and a lot of land suffered lodging and threshing losses. The expected bumper harvest of early rice in the province is impossible to achieve. However, most areas in the province are still harvesting, especially because of the central government's concern for the people of our province. In addition to allocating 50 million jin of rice, it has also reduced the task of transferring food out of the province after the summer harvest. In Guangdong, late rice is the main crop, and production has always been relatively stable and promising. It can be affirmed that food supply will absolutely not be a problem in this province after the disaster. Therefore, for general areas, the basic policy of grain purchase will be implemented without change, ensuring that enough food is left and ensuring that increased production does not increase purchases. For severely affected areas, according to the standard of necessary food rations, in addition to the part that they can solve themselves, the rest will be covered by the state. For cities and towns, from August 1st, the food supply standards can also be increased separately according to different situations. Regarding the supply of vegetables and other non-staple foods, the losses from the flood were not light, many vegetable gardens were submerged, some of the fish in some fish ponds were washed away, and many domestic animals and poultry died. This is the difficult aspect. However, favorable situations are also developing. It is estimated that vegetable supply will return to normal in a very short time. The production of livestock and poultry, because the policy of giving equal importance to public and private raising has been vigorously implemented in all people's communes, and it is guaranteed to allocate necessary feed land to the members, it is certain that it will develop rapidly; after a period of time, the supply problem can also be solved.

In short, food should be saved, and the supply will not be a problem; for the supply of vegetables and non-staple foods, a series of effective measures have been taken. After the disaster, there are more difficulties, but the problem can be gradually solved completely. "There are difficulties, there are solutions, there is hope," this is the conclusion.

    陶铸同志就广东抗洪救灾问题答记者
    洪水夺走的我们定要拿回来
    全国全省大局都很好，困难仅仅是局部的和暂时性的，把工作做好，就能够尽快克服
    新华社广州30日电　广东省抗洪斗争持续了半个多月；东江流域部分县受灾。究竟这场斗争的情况怎样？如何迅速改变灾区面貌？这次水灾对人民经济生活将发生什么影响？新华社记者为此访问了中共广东省委第一书记陶铸同志。陶铸同志答复了如下问题。
    问：全省抗洪斗争情况怎样？为什么制服不了东江特大洪水，以致泛滥成灾。
    答：到了今天全省抗洪斗争已胜利结束了。这是一场十分激烈的斗争。各地区的党政领导、广大干部和人民群众进行了英勇顽强的战斗，历尽艰险，奋不顾身，我谨代表广东省委致以亲切的慰问。尤其是驻在本省的人民解放军在斗争中作出了卓越的贡献，灾区人民到处传颂，我们深表感激。西江、北江此次出现的洪水，是几年来最大的一次。同1949年和1915年两次大水比较，洪峰在思贤?会合时，流量没有那两年的大，但在思贤?以下的水位，则不仅比1949年高，比1915年也高。因为那两年，思贤?以下沿江堤围纷纷崩溃，所以下游的水势减弱。但在那两年，珠江三角洲的堤围几乎全部崩溃了。我们这次却把它抵御住了。这种洪水，我们已经基本掌握了它的规律。在解放后的九年来，我们有计划地兴修水利工程，这次起到了应有的作用，所以我们有把握战胜它；经过广大干部和群众的努力，我们果然战胜了。但东江流域的情况却不同。东江流域所发生的洪水，是自有水文记载以来最大的洪水，在我们现有的条件下，还是抗御不了的；所以经过极大的努力以后，仍然避免不了这场灾害。
    对于东江流域此次出现的洪水，可以说，我们是设想到了，但它的严重程度却没有设想到。也可以说，像这次那么大的洪水是我们根本没有意料到的。东江多灾多害，差不多每隔一年就发大水，必须大力改变这种恶劣的情况，这点早就设想到了。所以，解放以来，我们逐年新建和培修了大批山塘、水库、渠道、堤围；更从去年起，在东江最大的支流——新丰江上建设新丰江水库（电站）。新丰江水库，不仅为了发电，而且也是为了防洪。东江流域中新丰江流域就占了六千平方公里，又历来是暴雨的中心。新丰江水库可控制惠阳城以上东江流域洪水的40％。这个水库现在还未建成，不能够在这次洪水中发挥作用。否则，情况就会好得多。
    为什么又说我们没有想到呢？因为这次洪水超过了有水文记载以来的纪录。这说明，掌握自然界的规律，特别是像天文气象等的规律极不容易。向来，我们对沿江沿河的水利建设，是要保证在历史上最高洪水位也不漫顶决口。但是，从6月11日到15日，五日之内，东江流域及其附近的十二个县，便下了三百到五百公厘的雨，其中暴雨地带的八个县，下了六百公厘以上的雨。东江流域支流纵横，地面集雨面积又很大。这样一来，出现了超过有水文记载以来的特大洪水。惠阳城附近的东江水位高达一七点五七公尺，比有水文记载以来的1947年的最高水位一六点零九公尺，还高一点四八公尺。在这样大这样凶的洪水袭击下，沿江堤围，决堤漫顶，就非今天的人力所能挽回。这是我们没有预料到的。
    问：像东江此次暴发的这么大的洪水，以后能否战胜？
    答：这是肯定的。经一事，长一智。经过这场大洪水，增加了我们掌握自然规律的知识，那我们就有可能把它战胜。我们有此力量，也一定这样办。明年建成新丰江水库后，除发电、灌溉以外，就可以对东江洪水起极大的控制作用。为根本改变东江的多灾多害情况，我们正在东江下游的惠阳县筹建铜湖分洪工程，还计划在东江上游河源县修黄田水库。有了这些巨大的工程，辅以已建的大批其他水利工程，东江洪水再大一点，也可以抗拒得住。
    这一回，广州市和珠江三角洲保住了。汕头专区的韩江流域也保住了。这是因为在这些地方，我们掌握洪水规律的知识较多，又搞好了水利。保卫广州和珠江三角洲东部地区的北江大堤，我们年年加修，投资共一千三百万，把这条一百二十里的防洪堤修成一堵城墙。去年，又在一百里的防洪堤上加修了一道一公尺高的防浪石墙。广州虽然没有封建的城墙，但是却有这样一道防洪的城墙。有了这堵城墙，即使百年一遇的洪水，广州市的安全也不至于出什么问题。我们还计划在北江上游建连江口水库和潖江分洪工程。在西江，也正在计划修建高要县三榕峡水库。这些计划完成后，再辅助以其他水利工程，西、北江就可以驯服了。
    总之，只要掌握了自然规律，继续大修水利，就可以控制自然力的破坏作用，并使它为人类造福。我们有信心有力量办到，也一定能办到，必须办到。
    问：对于这次的灾情，你怎样估计？
    答：这场水灾是广东省解放以来最大的一次。损失很大。根据各地初步报来的数字统计，受淹早稻四百七十多万亩，受淹花生、甘蔗、黄麻和其他经济作物一百零八万亩左右，受淹受浸的晚稻秧苗十六万亩，受淹鱼塘十万亩左右，倒塌房屋二十万间以上。被冲垮冲坏的大小水利工程二万八千多处，受灾人口达二百万。因房屋倒塌或因抢救不及而被洪水冲走致死的干部、群众一百八十七人。失踪二十九人，受伤的二百零四人。这样严重的损失，要是在解放前的国民党反动派统治时期，不知多少年才能恢复元气。也不知是有多少人要流离失所，卖儿卖女，讨饭逃荒。然而，我们不仅有信心让人民重建家园，而且要在秋收以后基本上消灭水灾的痕迹。这岂不是奇迹。不错！我们要创造奇迹，而且一定能够办到！因为，我们有为人民服务的党，有无产阶级专政的国家，有无限生命力的人民公社，又处在大跃进的年代，所以，勇敢而勤劳的人民没有不可克服的困难。这不仅是过去反动统治时代所办不到的事，而且是在资本主义国家也办不到的事，我们却一定能办得到。
    问：那么，采取什么措施改变灾区面貌呢？
    答：我们说有力量迅速改变灾区面貌，这首先是有党中央和国务院的亲切关怀和大力支援。在防洪斗争和灾区抢救期间，国务院已经拨来了一千万元和五千万斤大米。中央还要拨给更大量的款项和物资来支援灾区生产自救，重建家园，修复水利。省里也要尽最大可能拿出力量来，领导灾区恢复生产，全面安排生活，包括口粮、住房、种籽、耕牛、农具、锅碗盆勺等等。困难比较大的是房子。二十万间房子倒塌，要一下子恢复还办不到，即使有那么多的材料，也没有那么多的劳动力。现在采取的紧急措施是盖搭工棚，同时修好一部分可以修复的房子，保证没有一户人家露宿，并把因为临时安插而住得过挤，仅蔽风雨的状况加以改善，以便受灾人民能把生活安定下来，鼓起劲头去搞生产。夏收夏种后就可以准备盖房子，先盖一部分；等秋收后大兴土木，争取明年春节前基本盖好，而且要盖得比水灾前牢固。所有材料费全部由国家包起来。
    中央和省的援助，是灾区恢复的有力保证，但最主要的仍然是灾区人民自力更生，奋发图强。生产自救历来是唯一正确的方针，总的要求是争取晚造特大丰收。自然界拿走了我们的东西，我们要向自然界拿回来。目前灾区，除极少数村庄以外，洪水已经消退，灾民生活已经有了安顿，再突击一下把住房情况改善，群众有吃有住，这就有了恢复生产的前提条件。现在，灾区的补播抢插工作进展迅速，这是极为可喜的现象。许多人民公社都提出了“一造收二造”、“一造等于一年”等豪迈口号，一面力争多种，一面力争高产。由于晚造生产条件有利，只要加倍努力，在国家大力支援之下，这个目标是可以达到的。所有灾区目前都要首先抓生产，一边搞生产，一边安排生活；等到晚造生产搞得差不多了，有个大丰收了，就一定可以拿出大的力量迅速地把家园重建起来。
    问：这场水灾，对于本省城乡人民的经济生活将要发生什么影响呢？
    答：既然是大灾，损失很大，那么，它对于人民的经济生活自然要发生一定的影响，带来一定的困难。但是，由于全国、全省大局都很好，所以这种困难又仅仅是局部的和暂时性的，把工作做好了，就能够尽快地克服。
    现在，城乡人民关心的是：受灾以后，粮食供应的情况将怎么样？蔬菜和其他副食品供应的情况将怎么样？关于下半年粮食供应问题，省委和省人委早已公布了政策和作出了规定，事情就照那样办。经过这场水灾，早造粮食生产损失的确很大，有二百多万亩田完全失收，二百几十万亩田减收，还有不少田发生倒伏、脱粒等损失。预期的全省早稻大丰收是不可能实现了。但是，省内仍然有大部分地区是丰收的，特别是由于中央对我省人民的关怀，除了拨来五千万斤大米以外，又减免了我省夏收后外调粮食任务。在广东，晚造是主要的一造，生产一向比较稳定，大有可为。可以肯定，本省在受灾以后，粮食供应绝对不会发生问题。所以，对一般地区，粮食征购的基本政策，言出必行，决不变更，保证留足口粮，保证增产不增购。对重灾区，按必需口粮的标准，除了自己能够解决的部分以外，其余由国家包起来。对城镇，从8月1日起，粮食供应标准还可以按不同情况分别提高一些。关于蔬菜和其他副食品供应问题，由于水灾的损失不轻，菜园受浸不少，一部分的鱼塘的鱼被冲走了，家畜、家禽也死了不少，这是困难的方面。但是，有利的情况也正在发展。估计蔬菜供应在很短的时间内即可恢复正常。家畜家禽的生产，由于已经在各人民公社大力贯彻公养和私养并重的方针，又保证拨给社员以必要的饲料地，是肯定会发展得很快的；经过一个时期以后，供应问题也是可以解决的。
    总之，粮食要节约，供应不成问题；蔬菜和副食品的供应，已经采取了一系列有成效的措施，受灾以后，困难多了一些，但问题完全可以逐步解决。“有困难，有办法，有希望”，这就是结论。
