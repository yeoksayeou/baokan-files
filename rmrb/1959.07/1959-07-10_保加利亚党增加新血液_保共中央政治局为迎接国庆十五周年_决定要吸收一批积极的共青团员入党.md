    Bulgarian Party Increases New Blood
    Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee Politburo to Welcome 15th Anniversary of National Day
    Decides to Absorb a Batch of Active Communist Youth League Members into the Party
    Sofia dispatch, July 9th – The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party issued a resolution on July 6th regarding the absorption of a group of Communist Youth League members into the Party. The resolution stated: “The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, noting the great role and significant contributions of our country's youth in socialist construction, as well as their selfless struggle to achieve the accelerated development of the national economy, believes that absorbing a group of Communist Youth League members into the Party in preparation for the 15th anniversary of National Day on September 9th is appropriate and beneficial for educating youth in the revolutionary spirit.
    The work of absorbing Party members will be carried out among those Communist Youth League members who demonstrate the most activity in labor and political activities, while strictly adhering to the principles of individual Party membership and considering the needs of the Party core in all sectors of life.”
  "Rabotnichesko Delo" published an editorial on July 8th entitled "New Blood for the Party" regarding this resolution of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee.
    The editorial first discussed the significant achievements made by Bulgarian youth in all aspects of life under the leadership of the Party, and pointed out that the resolution to absorb Communist Youth League members into the Party is not only of great significance for the communist education of the younger generation, but also of great significance for strengthening the Party organization and even strengthening the entire Party.
    The editorial stated that absorbing Communist Youth League members into the Party to celebrate the 15th anniversary of National Day is not a general celebration activity, but a very important task, and therefore requires Party organizations and Communist Youth League organizations to make serious preparations. In this work of absorbing Communist Youth League members into the Party, Party organizations should help improve the social composition and quality of the Party organization and strengthen the communist core of participants in socialist construction. The editorial emphasized that attention should be paid to developing Party members from League members who are closely linked to production.
    The editorial concluded that replenishing the Party ranks with new forces, caring for the selection and education of the younger generation of successors, is caring for the future of the Party, caring for the continuous improvement of the Party organization's combat effectiveness, and caring for strengthening ties with the masses.

    保加利亚党增加新血液
    保共中央政治局为迎接国庆十五周年
    决定要吸收一批积极的共青团员入党
    本报索非亚9日电　保加利亚共产党中央委员会政治局于7月6日发表了关于吸收一批共青团员入党的决议。决议说：“保加利亚共产党中央委员会政治局注意到我国青年在社会主义建设中的巨大作用和重大贡献以及他们为争取实现加速发展国民经济所作的忘我的斗争，认为，为迎接9月9日国庆十五周年吸收一批共青团员入党，对于以革命的精神教育青年，是适宜的和有益的。
    吸收党员的工作将在那些在劳动中和政治活动中表现最积极的共青团员中进行，同时要严格遵守个别入党和考虑生活各个部门党核心的需要的原则。”
  “工人事业报”8日就保共中央这一决议发表了题为“党的新血液”的社论。
    社论首先谈到了保加利亚青年在党的领导下在生活的各个方面所取得的重大成绩，并指出，吸收共青团员入党的决议不仅对青年一代的共产主义教育有巨大的意义，而且对加强党的组织、甚至加强全党有巨大的意义。
    社论说，为庆祝国庆十五周年而吸收共青团员入党，这不是一般的庆祝活动，而是一件非常重大的任务，因此要求党组织和青年团组织认真地作好准备工作。党组织在这次吸收共青团员入党的工作上应该做到有助于改善党组织的社会成份和质量并且加强社会主义建设参加者的共产主义核心。社论强调指出，要注意从同生产有紧密联系的团员中发展党员。
    社论最后说，用新生力量补充党的队伍，关心挑选和教育青年一代接班人，这就是关心党的未来、关心不断提高党组织的战斗力和关心加强与群众的联系。
