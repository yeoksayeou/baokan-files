(Our Wuhan dispatch, July 26th) Since the second quarter, the Jiang'an Vehicle Depot of the Wuhan Railway Bureau has strengthened its enterprise management by focusing on daily operation plans, gradually improving the overall vehicle delivery qualification rate, reaching 100% in June. The output value, production volume, cost, and labor productivity plans for the second quarter have all been overfulfilled. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes this experience is very good and requires the party committees of all industries in Wuhan to seriously discuss and learn from it.

This year, the Jiang'an Vehicle Depot's repair task has more than doubled compared to last year. At the beginning of the year, many cadres did not pay enough attention to planning and management, and the monthly production tasks were almost all concentrated in a ten-day or half-month sprint; sometimes fourteen or fifteen vehicles were delivered in one day, while at other times it was less than half that number. Due to the chaotic production, the quality was also affected, resulting in some rework.

After summarizing the experience and lessons of the first quarter, the Jiang'an Vehicle Depot Party Committee realized that to change the chaotic production situation, it was necessary to combine the vigorous mass movement with scientific management, and establish the idea of rhythmic and balanced production. In the spirit of "striving for initiative without neglecting subsequent tasks," they made arrangements for the monthly vehicle repair plan on a ten-day and daily basis, setting a daily repair target of nine vehicles and assigning it to the workshops. The workshops also based on the conditions of labor, materials, equipment, and poor night production conditions, according to the requirements of "guarantee two and strive for three" (guaranteeing the delivery of two vehicles in the morning and striving to complete three) and "five during the day and four at night" (delivering five vehicles during the day shift and four during the night shift) to specifically arrange the daily vehicle repair plan.

In order to implement the daily operation plan, they actively rectified and improved the breakdown completion inspection system, as well as the vehicle repair progress inspection and completion analysis systems, so that a vehicle, from the time it was decided to enter the factory, could be carried out according to plan in terms of material supply, parts supply, repair quality, and progress. They also used small blackboards to announce the daily operation plan, which clearly stated the requirements for each work type and group each day, the specific start time and completion time, etc., so that workers, after going to work and looking at the small blackboard, would have a clear idea of the day's tasks and be able to work proactively according to their tasks and closely cooperate with other work types. After each group completed its work, it also filled in the execution of the plan on the blackboard, allowing leaders to grasp the production progress at any time based on the records on the blackboard, and to discover and solve problems in a timely manner.

In the socialist labor competition, many groups demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation, actively innovated technology, and proactively helped other groups overcome difficulties. Seeing that the three people in the sand-turning group were still unable to meet the demand for coal powder, the forging group took the initiative to make a coal powder pulverizer and gave it to the sand-turning group, and one person's production for one day could supply the sand-turning group for seven days. The woodworking tasks were heavy, and there were many new apprentices, making it very difficult to complete the daily plan. Workshop director Wang Dexian and master Wang Jufang painstakingly researched and developed a vertical wood planer, which could perform various planing tasks, greatly improving work efficiency. For example, it took half an hour to make a passenger car window strip by hand, but it only took seven seconds with a wood planer.

After the implementation of the daily operation plan, if the quality of one process was unqualified and needed to be reworked, it would affect the completion of the entire plan. Therefore, the workers were very concerned about the quality of vehicle repair. In addition to the section strengthening acceptance work, the workers launched a mass inspection, timely plugging various loopholes, and improving the storage and maintenance system of tools and equipment.

In the second quarter, this section only failed to complete the daily plan for thirteen days, of which twelve days completed more than 90% of the plan, and one day completed 86%. Their overall vehicle delivery qualification rate reached 98% in April and May, and 100% in June.

In July, the Jiang'an Vehicle Depot Party Committee further strengthened political and ideological work and enterprise management among workers and cadres. It is expected to complete the monthly vehicle repair plan four days ahead of schedule according to variety, and the overall vehicle delivery qualification rate will reach 100%.

### 赶前不拉后处处争主动  江岸车辆段树立均衡生产观念各项指标满堂红

    赶前不拉后处处争主动
    江岸车辆段树立均衡生产观念各项指标满堂红
    本报武汉26日电　武汉铁路管理局江岸车辆段在第二季度以来通过抓日作业计划，加强了企业管理，总交车合格率逐步提高，六月份达到百分之百。二季度的产值、产量、成本、劳动生产率计划，也都超额完成。中共武汉市委认为这个经验很好，要求武汉各产业党委认真讨论和学习。
    江岸车辆段今年的修车任务比去年增加了一倍多。年初，许多干部对计划管理重视不够，每月的生产任务差不多都集中在十天或半个月内突击完成；有时一天出车十四、五辆，有时则不到此数的一半。由于生产忙乱，质量也受到影响，出了一些返工活。
    江岸车辆段党委会总结第一季度的经验教训以后，认识到要改变生产忙乱的局面，必须将大搞群众运动和科学管理结合起来，树立起有节奏的均衡生产的思想。他们本着“赶前不拉后，打主动仗”的精神，把每个月的修车计划按旬、按日作好安排，确定了每日修车九辆的指标下达到车间。车间也根据劳力、材料、设备和夜间生产条件较差的情况，按照“保二争三”（上午保证交车二辆，争取落成三辆）
  “昼五夜四”（白班交五辆、夜班交四辆）的要求来具体安排每日修车计划。
    为了贯彻执行日作业计划，他们积极整顿和健全了分解完毕检查制度以及修车进度检查、完工分析等制度，使一辆车从决定进厂起，就在材料供应、配件供应、修理质量和进度方面，能够按计划进行。他们还用小黑板公布日作业计划，上面写明每天对各工种、小组的要求、具体开工时间和完成时间等，使工人上班以后一看小黑板，就对全天任务心中有底，能根据自己的任务主动工作，并且与其他工种密切配合。各组完工以后，也在小黑板上填写执行计划的情况，领导人员能够随时根据小黑板的记载，掌握生产进度，及时发现问题和解决问题。
    在社会主义劳动竞赛中，许多小组发挥共产主义协作精神，积极革新技术，并主动帮助别的组克服困难。锻工组看到翻砂组三个人捣炭末粉仍然供不应求，便主动做了一部炭末粉碎机送给翻砂组，一人生产一天就能供翻砂组七天使用。木工活任务重，新学徒又多，完成日计划的困难很大，工长王德先和老师傅王菊芳就苦心钻研出一种立式刨木机，可以作各种刨活，使工效大大提高。例如，手工做客车车窗条，半小时做一个，用刨木机只要七秒钟就行了。
    执行日作业计划以后，如果有一个工序质量不合格需要返工，便会影响整个计划的完成，因此，职工们都非常关心修车质量。除段上加强验收工作外，工人们展开了群众性的检查，及时堵塞了各种漏洞，并且健全了工具、设备的保管、维修制度。
    这个段在第二季度只有十三天没有完成日计划，其中有十二天完成计划90％以上，有一天完成86％。他们的总交车合格率，在4、5两月份达到98％，6月份达到百分之百。
    7月份，江岸车辆段党委又进一步在工人和干部中加强政治思想工作和企业管理。预计提前四天按品种完成全月修车计划，总交车合格率达到百分之百。
