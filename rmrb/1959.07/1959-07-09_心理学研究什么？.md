What Does Psychology Study?
Cao Richang

Psychology, as the name suggests, is the science that studies the laws of consciousness. The meaning of consciousness is very broad. Just as not all questions about matter are the objects of physics research, not all questions about consciousness are studied by psychology. Psychology mainly studies the following three aspects of consciousness:

1.  The origin, occurrence, and development of consciousness. At what stage of the development of matter did consciousness arise? How does consciousness develop from a low-level state to a high-level form?
2.  The process by which humans reflect objective reality. Through what process and mechanism do humans reflect the objective world and generate consciousness?
3.  The characteristics of human conscious activity. What are the characteristics of human conscious activity? How are these characteristics produced?

The Origin, Occurrence, and Development of Consciousness

Research on the origin, occurrence, and development of consciousness is mainly the task of animal psychology (child psychology and the history of human psychological development are also related). Many research results in animal psychology are of great significance. For example, its research shows that if the formation of conditioned reflexes is taken as an indicator of psychological activity, it can be seen that psychological phenomena are related to the nervous system, because animals with nervous systems can generally form conditioned reflexes under appropriate conditions. It can be said that psychology is the manifestation of the activity of the nervous system and the function of the nervous system. The primitive form of the animal nervous system is the reticular nerve of coelenterates. The reticular nerve is developed from the nerve-muscle cells of lower coelenterates, which are differentiated from the ordinary cells of lower multicellular animals.

All biological tissues (cells) have sensitivity. When nutrients or harmful stimuli directly act on the organism, the organism will react. For example, the leaves of plants grow towards the light and the roots grow towards the water, and amoebas and even hydras seize food and avoid harmful stimuli. After the nervous system appeared, animals could perceive distant stimuli or "signal" stimuli that were indirectly related to life. A conditioned reflex is a response to a signal stimulus. There are two basic forms of activity in the nervous system, namely excitation and inhibition, both of which are related to the basic functions of life - metabolism. Excitation is a special form of the decomposition function of nerve cells, while inhibition is a manifestation of the synthesis function. Therefore, the function of the nervous system is one of the basic functions of life, which enables animals to expand their living environment, reflect environmental conditions, adapt to the environment, and ensure life.

As animals evolve and ascend the ladder, the nervous system becomes more complex, and psychological activities also become more flexible and richer. (1) Lower animals can only react to a narrow range of environmental changes, and they only react to things that are directly related to life. The higher the position of an animal on the evolutionary ladder, the wider the range of environmental changes it can react to. For example, apes search for and play with things that are not related to life, thereby enriching their lives. (2) The higher the position of an animal on the evolutionary ladder, the more flexible its reactions. Lower animals do not easily stop even if their actions have no results. For example, spiders spin webs to catch insects, and even if no small insects fall into the web, the spider always tends to the source of the web's vibration; tigers and leopards also make preparations for hunting when the wind blows the grass, but if there is no object to be captured, the tiger and leopard will immediately stop their actions. Lower animals find it difficult to change their instinctive activities, such as moths flying into flames, unchanging until death. Tigers and leopards are originally afraid of fire and can eat people, but the tigers and leopards in the circus can jump through fire hoops and only obey the trainers. Therefore, the more advanced the animal, the more it can adapt to the environment through individual experience. (3) The tendency of psychological activities to become flexible and rich is due to the development of analysis and synthesis abilities. Lower animals can only react to changes in the single nature of environmental things. For example, as long as a spider web vibrates, the spider tends to the source of the web's vibration, regardless of whether there are small insects or not. Higher animals can synthesize multiple changes in related things and give appropriate responses. Spiders cannot distinguish between small insects falling into the web and other reasons causing the web to vibrate, while tigers and leopards can easily distinguish whether there is a prey nearby. All of this shows that consciousness is an attribute of matter, a product of matter developing to a certain stage, i.e., when the nervous system appears. Consciousness also develops from a nascent state and a low-level stage regularly towards a high-level form. The evolution and development of animal psychology prepares the preconditions for the emergence of human consciousness. Human psychology has a certain continuity with animal psychology, so understanding the development of animal consciousness is helpful for studying human conscious activity. For example, Darwin, through his research on animals, understood the origin of many human emotional expressions (such as gnashing teeth in anger). Research on the development of consciousness is even more theoretically significant. Therefore, Lenin listed "the history of the development of animal intelligence" as one of the knowledge fields constituting epistemology and dialectics. Any underestimation of the study of animal psychology is unwarranted.

The Process by Which Humans Reflect Objective Reality

Psychological activity or the function of the nervous system is to reflect environmental conditions, and consciousness is a reflection of the objective world. How animals, especially humans, reflect objective reality and generate consciousness is the core issue of psychology.

When a person comes into contact with objective things, the objective things act on the sensory organs. A series of nerve activity processes occur from the sensory organs to the brain and response organs. When nerve activity occurs in the brain, the person feels the things acting on the sensory organs. This is sensation. The traces of sensation form images, and similar images are generalized to form concepts. Thinking is carried out using concepts. Through thinking, people can have a deeper reflection of objective reality. People's understanding of objective things generates attitudes towards objective things, such as satisfaction, dissatisfaction (emotion), avoidance, struggle, and transformation (will). This is a reflection of the relationship between people themselves and objective things. Psychology has conducted research on this series of reflection processes and has achieved certain results, finding some laws. For example, the laws of mutual inhibition and promotion of sensation, the laws of difference sensation (Weber's law), the law that distributed memorization is superior to concentrated memorization, the law of forgetting speed (forgetting curve), and so on. These laws have theoretical significance. Their acquisition allows people to have some understanding of how people recognize the objective world, that is, people's cognitive activities.

Mastering the laws of psychological activity is of great significance for guiding production and other social practices. For example, in industry, those who inspect the quality of products based on vision and hearing must pay attention to the laws of difference sensation. In education, arranging learning and review cannot ignore the laws of learning and memorization. Various professional psychologies study the process by which people reflect related objective things in their special fields. The results obtained often have important significance for improving the work efficiency of related businesses. For example, educational psychologists study how children master the order, relationship, and practical significance of numbers to form number concepts. Based on the research results, elementary school arithmetic teaching can be improved. Labor psychologists study how workers can have a faster, more comprehensive, and accurate reflection on labor tools and labor objects, thereby improving labor productivity, preventing accidents, and reducing labor intensity. Medical psychologists study how patients' reflection on the causes of disease and symptoms affects the disease-causing and medical process, thereby formulating principles and methods of psychological treatment to promote curative effects.

Reflection is a function of the brain, and psychological phenomena are the manifestation of brain activity. Therefore, psychological phenomena are restricted by the laws of brain activity and also show the regularity of brain activity. For example, red and green colors complement each other and are particularly bright; the same small piece of gray paper appears grayish-yellow when pasted on blue paper, and appears bluish-gray when pasted on yellow paper. This is called color contrast. Another example is that if two similar things are learned one after the other, the first learned interferes with the latter learned, and the latter learned hinders the memory of the first learned. The former is called inhibition, and the latter is called retroactive inhibition. Furthermore, consider the concentration and distraction of attention. When concentrating on one thing, one often does not see or hear other things. When concentrating for a long time, one cannot avoid mental distraction. These phenomena seem to have nothing to do with each other, but after we understand the laws of brain activity, we know that these are all caused by the mutual induction of the excitation and inhibition processes of the brain.

At present, very little is known about the laws of human brain activity; for the majority of psychological phenomena, we only know what it is, but not why it is, and we cannot explain it from the laws of brain activity. For example, for the feeling of difference, why does the brightness difference of light have to reach 1%, the weight difference has to reach one-thirtieth, and the sound intensity has to reach one-tenth to be felt? Why are the proportions different in different sensory fields? There is no comprehensive explanation yet. Another example is that people who are a little older have experienced that sometimes they suddenly forget very familiar things (such as not being able to name a very familiar comrade when meeting), and then suddenly remember it after a while. For this phenomenon, now we can only say that it is due to a temporary state of inhibition in the brain, but it is not clear why this is.

"The brain is the organ of thinking" (Lenin). The more we understand the laws of brain activity, the more we can have a more in-depth and comprehensive understanding of conscious activity. Mastering the laws of human brain activity also makes it possible to use these laws to improve the efficiency of the brain. For example, if we master the laws of brain activity related to memory in the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of memory, so that needed experiences can be recalled at any time.

Psychology must study the laws of brain activity. Lenin once instructed psychologists to "directly study the material body of psychological phenomena (nerve processes)." Of course, psychology should have an appropriate division of labor with physiology in the study of the brain. Roughly, physiology studies the internal material movement of the brain, and psychology studies how brain activity reflects external things. Physiological research is very important for psychology. As Pavlov said, physiological research "lays a good foundation for psychological knowledge." The laws of psychological phenomena often have a guiding effect on physiological research. For example, the laws of association undoubtedly have enlightening significance for the physiological research of temporary connections and connection functions. Elucidating brain function is the common task of psychology, physiology, and other related sciences. It is not correct to think that psychology does not need to engage in the research of brain function.

Characteristics of Human Conscious Activity

The development from animal to human is a qualitative leap. Due to the existence of social life, language, and labor, human consciousness has a new face and is essentially different from animal psychology.

The most prominent features of human conscious activity are consciousness and initiative. Humans not only have conscious activity, but also know that they have conscious activity. The commonly called "conscious" activity is also "self-conscious" activity. The consciousness of consciousness is inseparable from language. Humans have language, can describe current objective things, and can also describe their own activities. Research in child psychology shows that when children initially master language, they can only praise objective things or their own demands, and cannot describe their own activities. When they can describe their own activities, planned activities—which are manifestations of conscious conscious activity—also appear. A very likely situation is that after there are conscious activities that reflect objective reality and descriptions of these activities, these descriptions gradually develop into conscious conscious activities from people to themselves, from using complete spoken language to using concise and silent language.

The fact that children have conscious conscious activity is a manifestation of the gradual maturation of the brain's second signal system and the coordinated activity of the two signal systems. Objective things cause the coordinated activity of the two signal systems, producing conscious consciousness. If it only causes the activity of the first signal system, such as covering or removing the quilt due to feeling cold or hot during sleep, that is an unconscious activity. Psychology still knows very little about the consciousness of human consciousness. If it does not further study it from the aspect of the brain's activity mechanism, it will be difficult to obtain more results.

In the process of humans coming into contact with external things, external things act on the sensory organs, causing brain activity to produce sensations. Humans regulate the activity of coming into contact with external things based on sensations, which further affects external things. This is a simplified description of the process by which humans reflect objective reality. Human reflection on objective reality is obtained in practical activities acting on the objective world, and reflection on reality further guides practical activities, which is the manifestation of the active role of reflection. Human consciousness reflects objective laws. After people recognize objective laws, they use them to transform the objective world, which is the initiative of consciousness. The initiative of consciousness is produced by the essence that consciousness is a reflection of objective reality. This can also be corroborated in the development of child psychology. The first time a child shows initiative and declares "I do it myself" is after he has initially mastered the operating methods of using toys or tools. This shows that mastering objective laws shows initiative. People who have mastered objective laws can foresee the future of things. As Marx said, "The result obtained at the end of the labor process already exists in the worker's conception at the beginning of the labor process, already existing conceptually." The conception (image) of future things forms a dominant excitation center in the brain, which affects and regulates related nerve activities due to reciprocal nerve processes. This may be the initiative of consciousness and a part of the physiological mechanism of foresight and consciousness. In psychology, studying the initiative of consciousness must conduct in-depth research on the essence that consciousness is a reflection of objective reality.

Another prominent feature of human conscious activity is that each person's conscious activity has its own personal characteristics, which is personality. In class society, people of the same class also have their common characteristics, which distinguish them from other classes. This is class nature. Psychology should also study personality and class nature.

A person's personality is related to his innate physique, but it is mainly formed in life experiences. Personality is mainly a reflection of a person's social relations and living conditions, and class nature is a reflection of social class status. The main manifestation of personality and class nature is the tendency of consciousness, that is, the attitude towards objective things, such as tending to accept or handle things in a certain way, and tending to reject or handle other things in a certain way. The tendency of consciousness is formed through multiple sensory cognitions (reflections) after generalization. For example, a middle school student lacks a sense of cherishing public property and collectivism. The school asks him to participate in factory labor. The first time he saw, and later worked with workers, to create valuable products from leftover materials, his attitude towards public property changed. He participated in assembly line work, and he saw how his work affected the work of his previous and subsequent processes, so his sense of responsibility for collaboration and collectivism was also strengthened. From here, it can be seen that changing the tendency of consciousness requires going through a specific cognitive process (that is, a reflection of objective things). Psychology studies personality and class nature to see how people form personality and class nature through the reflection of their social living conditions. Mastering the laws of the formation of personality and class nature can also be used to carry out cultivation, transformation, and education work based on it.

Both personality and class nature are reflections of living conditions, and reflection is a function of the brain. Therefore, studying personality and class nature cannot ignore the laws of the brain's reflection function. For example, both personality and class nature may have situations where they cannot adapt to current social living conditions, that is, consciousness lags behind reality. If we do not understand one of the laws of brain activity—the formation and transformation of dynamic stereotypes—it is impossible to explain the phenomenon of "lagging behind."

Personality and class nature affect conscious activity, making it show personal or class characteristics. Conscious activity with personality or class nature still follows the universal laws of conscious activity. For example, a group of people study a document. Afterwards, some people remember more, some people remember less, some people remember these, and some people remember those. This is personal characteristics, but the universal laws of memory can be summarized from this, such as meaningful memorization being better than mechanical memorization, and the amount of forgetting varies depending on the time distance after learning (forgetting curve), etc. Another example is that workers' work efficiency improves after their political consciousness is raised, creating miracles. This is a manifestation of class nature, but it is also a manifestation of the universal law that active and concentrated consciousness is prone to cause creative activities. Studying the influence of personality and class nature on conscious activity can deepen the understanding of the universal laws of conscious activity; mastering the universal laws is more helpful to understanding and even educating and transforming personality and class nature. Educational work should "teach students in accordance with their aptitude," which takes care of personality characteristics; the purpose is "all-round development," which overcomes some personality characteristics. In class society, class status is a major aspect of social life, but social life also has other aspects. Psychological consciousness that reflects objective reality related to social class has class nature, while psychological consciousness that reflects things unrelated to class has no class nature. For example, the learning interests of elementary school students and the work enthusiasm of workers are very different in socialist countries and capitalist countries; however, the process of children's formation of number concepts or the process of traffic workers identifying various signals on the road is not much different in socialist societies and capitalist societies. Personality, class nature, and the universal laws of psychological activity are the dialectical relationship between the particular and the general. Psychology still needs to conduct in-depth research on the relationship between personality and class nature and psychological activity. Emphasizing only one aspect, such as only recognizing common laws and not recognizing personality and class nature, is extremely wrong. The view that personality is the subject of psychology, that it determines all psychological activities, and that class nature is the core of psychological consciousness, which regulates and dominates all psychological activities, is also worth discussing.

The Method of Research Depends on the Nature of the Research Object

Human conscious activity is a very complex phenomenon, and the method used to study it is also a question. The method of research depends on the nature of the research object. If the object of research is affected by class, of course the method of class analysis must be used. For example, in the causes of neurasthenia, the attitude towards social life and work is often a factor. Some people are exceptionally responsible for their work, working day and night, and become ill due to overwork; others think about their own fame and treatment day and night, and are dissatisfied with everything, and become ill due to depression and worry. These two types of people obviously have different class consciousness, and this difference must be taken into account in diagnosis and treatment. But after such a class analysis has been carried out, it is still necessary to study how fatigue causes disease and how worry causes disease. Here, class analysis can no longer be used, but natural science methods must be used.

Not all of human conscious activity is affected by class. The main object of psychological research, that is, the process by which people reflect objective reality, does not change with changes in social living conditions. Although personality is a reflection of social living conditions and has a close relationship with class status, the structure of personality (aspects of personality expression such as ability, temperament, interest, etc.) and the laws of personality formation do not differ due to class. The reflection activity process of people engaged in various social practice business activities studied by psychology does not differ due to different classes or different social living conditions. For example, the process of children mastering language around the age of two and the process of steelworkers identifying flames and sparks do not differ in socialist societies and capitalist societies. Psychology must adopt different methods for studying these problems depending on the problem, and should not apply class analysis to all problems. In fact, class analysis cannot be applied to most problems. Some people advocate that class analysis must be carried out in the study of human psychology in class society, which itself may be a statement lacking analysis.

At present, psychology is still in its early stages of development. There are not many research results, and the research methods are not mature enough. The main method of psychological research now is still to observe and record human conscious activity in various practical activity fields, and analyze and summarize the laws of human psychological activity from the materials obtained in this way. This can not only obtain scientific results, but also help solve problems in practical activities. This is the direction of a large amount of research work in psychology at present.

However, scientific research needs to be in-depth analysis, and just observing and recording is not enough. To obtain accurate results, it is also necessary to analyze the basic process under controlled conditions, which is the experimental method. In the past, many research results in psychology were obtained from experimental research, and the effectiveness of experimental methods should not be belittled. With the development of experimental method technology, what could not be studied in the laboratory in the past may now or in the future be studied in the laboratory. We cannot simplify psychological phenomena, thinking that all problems can be studied using experimental methods immediately; nor can we mystify psychological phenomena, thinking that they are extremely complex (which is true) and impossible to study using modern scientific methods and technologies (which is arbitrary). In fact, psychological consciousness is also produced by material movement (brain activity), and all material movements have their common laws. For example, the sensation activity process is very similar to the pulse communication system, which is clear evidence. Psychology wants to study the brain's reflection function. At present, it is impossible to directly observe the internal situation of brain activity. This is one of the main difficulties encountered in psychological research. The development of modern science and technology provides new possibilities for studying brain activity. For example, it is possible to simulate some real situations and simulate some brain activity processes using the theories of information theory and cybernetics, automatic and remote control technology, and electronic and simulation calculation technology. Moreover, psychologists and related scientific workers are already conducting preliminary research in these areas in collaboration. In the past, comparing the eye to a camera helped to understand the function of the eye; now, using modern science and technology to conduct brain simulation will inevitably lead to further understanding of the laws of brain activity. Understanding the laws of brain activity can provide new principles for the design and manufacture of machines (manufacturing machines by simulating human functions is a common thing in the history of technology). We believe that this research comparing the human brain and machines may be a growth point for psychology and should become an important field of modern science.

The conditioned reflex experimental method has made many contributions to the study of the laws of brain activity. Modern brain electrophysiology allows us to observe brain activity through brain electrical phenomena and also opens up new avenues for studying the brain's reflection function. Psychology should use all possible new achievements in science, use all possible methods, and adopt a strategy of multiple approaches and encirclement from all sides to conquer the strong fortress of conscious activity.

× × × ×

Psychology studies the origin, occurrence, and development of consciousness and the process by which humans reflect the objective world. It provides arguments for dialectical materialism, further specifically demonstrating the primacy of matter, the secondariness of consciousness, that consciousness is a product of highly organized matter, and that consciousness is a reflection of objective reality. These philosophical propositions enable dialectical materialism to more thoroughly shatter dualism and idealism. Therefore, psychology is the main scientific basis of dialectical materialism philosophy, especially its epistemology and reflection theory.

Consciousness phenomena have always been regarded as a mystery of the universe, and mankind has wanted to understand it since the beginning of history. Hegel's absolute idea, which he assumed to be the origin of the universe, reached "self-knowledge" at the final stage of its development. This represents mankind's desire to understand its own knowledge and also shows that knowing one's own knowledge is the highest achievement of knowledge. Hegel could not complete this mission (no individual could complete this mission), and the absolute idea is a idealistic fabrication. Dialectical materialism laid the foundation for understanding human knowledge, and materialistic dialectics is the law of movement and development of nature, society, and thinking (consciousness, knowledge). Psychology studies the laws of consciousness and cognitive activities. Knowing these laws is equivalent to understanding cognition, and reaching the peak of knowledge.

    心理学研究什么？
    曹日昌
    心理学，顾名思义，是研究意识的规律的科学。意识的涵义很广，
  正如不是所有关于物质的问题都是物理学研究的对象，也不是所有关于意识的问题心理学都进行研究。心理学所研究的，大致是关于意识的下列三方面的问题：
      1、意识的起源、发生和发展。物质发展到什么阶段产生了意识？
   意识又如何由低级状态发展到高级形态？
      2、人对客观现实的反映过程。人经由什么过程和机制反映客观世界产生意识？
      3、人的意识活动的特征。人的意识活动有什么特征？这些特征是怎样产生的？
    意识的起源、发生和发展
    研究意识的起源、发生和发展，主要是动物心理学的任务（儿童心理学和人类心理发展史也有关系）。动物心理学的许多研究成果，都是有重要意义的。例如，它的研究表明：如以条件反射的形成作为具有心理活动的指标，那就可以看到心理现象是同神经系统相联系的，因为具有神经系统的动物，在适当条件下大都能形成条件反射。可以说，心理是神经系统活动的表现，是神经系统的机能。动物神经系统的原始形态是腔肠动物的网状神经。网状神经是由低等腔肠动物的神经——肌肉细胞发展来的，后者又是由低等多细胞动物的普通细胞分化出来的。
    一切生物机体组织（细胞）都有感应性。当营养物或伤害性刺激直接作用于机体组织时，机体就会发生反应。例如，植物的叶向光和根向水生长，变形虫以至水螅攫取食物和避免伤害性刺激，都是如此。有了神经系统之后，动物就可以感受同生命有间接关系的、远距离的刺激，或“信号”刺激。条件反射就是对信号刺激的反应。神经系统的活动有两种基本的形态，即兴奋和抑制，它们都同生命的基本机能——代谢作用联系着。兴奋是神经细胞的分解作用的特殊形式，抑制则是合成作用的表现。所以神经系统的机能是生命的基本机能之一，它使动物扩大生活环境，反映环境情况，以适应环境，保障生命生活。
    随着动物演化阶梯上升，神经系统趋于复杂，心理活动也趋于灵活、丰富。（1）低等动物所能反应的环境变化的范围很狭，它们只能对于那些同生活直接有关的事物才发生反应。动物在演化阶梯上位置越高，所能反应的环境变化的范围越广，如猿猴搜索和玩弄同生活不相干的东西，从而也丰富了它的生活内容。（2）动物在演化阶梯上位置越高，反应活动越灵活。低等动物即使动作无结果也不易停止。例如，蜘蛛结网捕虫，虽无小虫落网，蜘蛛每次都趋向网振动的来源方位；虎豹虽也因风吹草动作捕猎的准备动作，但如无捕获对象，虎豹就立刻停止行动。低等动物很难改变它的本能活动，如灯蛾扑火，至死不变。虎豹本来怕火，能吃人，但马戏团中的虎豹能钻火圈，唯训练者的命是从。所以越到高等的动物，越能由个体的经验适应环境。（3）心理活动的趋于灵活和丰富，是由于分析和综合能力的发展。低等动物只能反应环境事物的单一性质上的变化。如只要蜘蛛网一振动，蜘蛛就趋向网振动的来源方位，不管有无小虫。高等动物能综合有关事物的多种变化，给予适宜的反应。蜘蛛不能区别小虫落网同其他原因使网振动，虎豹则极易辨别附近有无捕获对象。这一切说明意识是物质的属性，是物质发展到一定阶段，即神经系统出现时的产物。意识也是由萌芽状态、低级阶段有规律地逐步向高级形态发展的。动物心理的演化发展为人的意识的出现准备了前提条件，人的心理同动物的心理有一定的连续性，所以了解动物意识的发展对于研究人的意识活动是有帮助的。例如，达尔文由于对动物的研究，了解了人类许多种情绪表现（如愤怒时的咬牙切齿）的由来。意识发展的研究更有理论意义。所以列宁把“动物智力发展史”列为构成认识论、辩证法的知识领域之一。对动物心理学研究的任何轻视都是不应该的。
        人对客观现实的反映过程
    心理活动或神经系统的机能是反映环境情况，意识是客观世界的反映。动物、特别是人如何反映客观现实而产生意识，这是心理学的核心问题。
    人在接触客观事物时，客观事物作用于感觉器官，由感觉器官到大脑和反应器官，发生一系列的神经活动历程，在大脑发生神经活动时人便感觉到作用于感觉器官的事物，这就是感觉。由感觉的痕迹形成表象，同类的表象经过概括形成概念，运用概念进行思惟。通过思惟，人对客观现实可以有更深入的反映。人由对客观事物的认识产生对客观事物的态度，满意、不满意（情感）、躲避、斗争、改造（意志）等，这是对人自己和客观事物的关系的反映。对这一系列的反映过程，心理学都进行了研究，也有了一定的成果，找到了一些规律。例如，感觉相互阻抑和助长的规律，差异感觉的规律（威伯律），分配识记优于集中识记的规律，遗忘速度的规律（遗忘曲线），等等。这些规律具有理论意义。它们的获得使人对于人如何认识客观世界，也就是对人的认识活动有了一些了解。
    掌握心理活动的规律对于指导生产和其他社会实践活动具有重要意义。例如，工业上凭视力和听力检验产品质量的，不能不注意差异感觉的规律。教育上安排学习和复习，不能不注意学习和识记的规律。各种专业心理学在其特殊领域内研究人对有关的客观事物的反映过程，研究所得成果对于提高有关业务的工作效率常有重要意义。例如，教育心理学者研究儿童如何掌握数的顺序、关系和实际意义等以形成数的概念，根据研究所得，可以改进小学的算术教学。劳动心理学者研究劳动者对劳动工具和劳动对象如何能有更迅速、全面和准确的反映，从而提高劳动生产率，防止事故，减低劳动强度。医疗心理学工作者研究病人对致病原因和病症的反映如何影响致病和医疗过程，从而制定心理治疗的原则和方法，以促进疗效。
    反映是脑的机能，心理现象是脑的活动的表现，因而心理现象为脑的活动规律所制约，也表现出脑的活动的规律性。例如红绿两色互相衬托，倍觉鲜艳；同样的小块灰色纸，贴在蓝纸上显出灰黄色，贴在黄纸上呈现蓝灰色，这叫做颜色对比。又如先后紧接学习两种接近的事物，先学习的干扰后学习的，后学习的妨碍对先学习的记忆，前者叫做抑制，后者叫做倒摄抑制。再如注意的集中和涣散，集中注意一件事物时对其他事物常视而不见、听而不闻，集中注意较久时又不免精神涣散。这几种现象看来好像没有什么联系，但我们认识大脑活动规律之后，就知道这都是由于大脑的兴奋和抑制过程的相互诱导所致。
    对于人脑活动的规律，现在知道得还很少；对于多数心理现象，我们还知其然不知其所以然，不能从脑的活动规律来说明。例如对于差异的感觉，何以光的亮度差异达1％，重量差异达三十分之一，声音强度达十分之一，才能感觉出来，不同感觉领域何以比例不同，现在都还没有全面的解释。又如年岁稍大的人都经验过，有时对很熟识的事物，忽然忘记了（如很熟识的同志见面时叫不出名字来），过一会又忽然想起来。对这种现象现在只能说是由于大脑内一时的抑制状态，但何以如此，还不明白。
    “脑是思惟的器官”（列宁）。对于脑的活动规律认识越多，对于意识活动才越能有比较深入的全面的了解。掌握了人脑活动的规律，也就有可能运用这些规律，提高脑的工作效能。例如，将来掌握了有关记忆的脑的活动规律，就有可能提高记忆的效能，使需要的经验能随时回忆出来。
    心理学必须研究脑的活动规律，列宁曾指示心理学家要“径直研究心理现象的物质本体（神经过程）”。当然，对于脑的研究，心理学要同生理学有适当的分工。大致生理学研究脑的内部的物质运动，心理学研究脑的活动如何反映外界事物。生理学的研究对于心理学是非常重要的，如巴甫洛夫所说，生理学的研究“替心理学知识打好根基”。心理现象的规律对于生理学的研究也常有指引作用。例如，联想的规律对于暂时联系和接通机能的生理学研究，无疑是有启发意义的。阐明大脑机能是心理学、生理学和其他有关科学的共同任务，以为心理学不必从事脑的机能的研究，不是正确的看法。
            人的意识活动的特征
    由动物发展到人是一个质的飞跃。由于有了社会生活、语言和劳动，人的意识有了新的面貌，同动物的心理已有本质的不同。
    人的意识活动的最显著的特征是自觉性和能动性。人不仅有意识活动，还知道自己有意识活动。普通所谓“有意识的”活动，也就是“自觉的”活动。意识的自觉性是同语言分不开的。人有了语言，能叙述当前的客观事物，也能叙述自己的活动。儿童心理学的研究表明：儿童初步掌握语言时，只能称道客观事物或自己的要求，不能描述自己的活动。到能描述自己的活动时，有计划的活动——这是自觉的意识活动的表现，也就出现了。一种极为可能的情况是：有了反映客观现实的意识活动和对这种活动的叙述，这种叙述由对人到对己，由用有声的完备的语言到用无声的简略的语言，逐步发展成为自觉的意识活动。
    儿童有自觉的意识活动是脑的第二信号系统逐渐成熟、两种信号系统协同活动的表现。客观事物引起两种信号系统的协同活动，产生自觉的意识。如果只引起第一信号系统的活动，如在睡眠中因感冷热而盖上或拿开被盖，那就是不自觉的活动。心理学对于人的意识的自觉性了解还很少，如果不从脑的活动机制方面进一步研究，那是难以获得更多结果的。
    人在接触外界事物的活动中，外界事物作用于感觉器官，引起大脑活动产生感觉，人根据感觉调节接触外界事物的活动，又进一步影响外界事物。这是人对客观现实的反映过程的简约叙述。人对客观现实的反映是在作用于客观世界的实践活动中获得的，对现实的反映又进一步指导实践活动，就是反映的能动作用的表现。人的意识反映客观规律，人认识客观规律之后，用它改造客观世界，就是意识的能动性。意识的能动性是由意识是对客观现实的反映这一本质产生的。这在儿童心理的发展中也可以得到旁证。儿童最初表现主动性，声明“我自己做”，是在他初步掌握了运用玩具或工具的操作方法之后。这表明：掌握了客观规律，就表现出能动性。人掌握了客观规律就能预见到事物的将来，如马克思所说“劳动过程终末时取得的结果，已经在劳动过程开始时，存在于劳动者的观念中，已经观念地存在着了”。关于将来事物的观念（表象）在脑中形成一个优势兴奋中心，由于往复的神经过程，它影响调节有关的神经活动，这可能是意识能动性，也是预见性和自觉性的生理机制的一部分。心理学上研究意识的能动性，必须对意识是客观现实的反映这一本质进行深入的研究。
    人的意识活动的另一种显著的特征，是每个人的意识活动都有其个人特点，这是个性。在阶级社会中，同一阶级的人也有其共同的特点，以别于其他阶级，这是阶级性。对于个性和阶级性，心理学也应该研究。
    一个人的个性同他与生俱来的体质有关，但主要是在生活经历中形成的。个性主要是一个人的社会关系、生活条件的反映，阶级性是社会阶级地位的反映。个性和阶级性的主要表现是意识倾向性，即对客观事物的态度，如对一些事物倾向于接受或这样处理，对另一些事物倾向于拒绝或那样处理。意识倾向性是通过多次的感性认识（反映）经过概括形成的。例如，有一个中学生缺乏爱护公共财物和集体主义精神，学校要他去参加工厂劳动。他第一次看到、后来又同工人一起用边料废料做出了很有价值的产品，于是他对公共财物的态度改变了。他参加了流水生产线工作，他看到他的工作如何影响他的前后的工序的工作，于是他对协作的责任心和集体主义精神也加强了。从这里看出来，改变意识倾向性需要经过具体的认识过程（也就是对客观事物的反映）。心理学研究个性和阶级性，要看人如何通过对他的社会生活条件的反映，形成个性和阶级性。掌握了个性和阶级性形成的规律，也就可以根据它进行培养、改造和教育的工作。
    个性和阶级性都是生活条件的反映，而反映是大脑的机能，因此，研究个性和阶级性也不能忽略脑的反映机能的规律。例如，个性和阶级性都可能有不能适应当前社会生活条件的情况，也就是意识落后于现实。如果不理解脑的活动规律之一——动型的形成和改造，那是不能说明“落后”的现象的。
    个性和阶级性影响意识活动使它表现出个人或阶级的特色，具有个性或阶级性特色的意识活动也还是遵循意识活动的普遍规律的。例如，一组人学习一个文件，事后有人记得多，有人记得少，有人记住这些，有人记住那些，这是个人特色，但从这里总结出记忆的普遍规律，如有意义的识记胜于机械的识记，遗忘的数量因学习后的时间距离而不同，
  （遗忘曲线）等。又例如，工人在政治觉悟提高之后工作效率提高，创出奇迹，这是阶级性的表现，但也是意识活跃集中容易引起创造性活动这一普遍规律的表现。研究个性和阶级性对意识活动的影响，可以深入了解意识活动的普遍规律；掌握了普遍规律，更有助于了解以至教育改造个性和阶级性。教育工作要“因材施教”，是照顾个性特点；目的在
  “全面发展”，又是克服一些个性特点。在阶级社会中，阶级地位是社会生活的一个主要方面，但社会生活还有其他方面。反映同社会阶级有关的客观现实的心理意识具有阶级性，反映同阶级无关的事物的心理意识没有阶级性。例如，小学生的学习兴趣和工人的工作热情，在社会主义国家和资本主义国家大不相同；但儿童的关于数的概念的形成过程或交通工人对路上各种信号的鉴别过程，在社会主义社会和资本主义社会并没有什么差别。个性、阶级性和心理活动的普遍规律，是特殊和一般的辩证关系。对于个性和阶级性同心理活动的关系，心理学还须进行深入的研究。只强调一方面，如只承认共同规律不承认个性和阶级性，那是极端错误的。认为个性是心理的主体，它决定一切心理活动，阶级性是心理意识的核心，它调节和支配一切心理活动，这种说法也是值得商榷的。
      研究的方法决定于研究对象的性质
    人的意识活动是一种非常复杂的现象，用什么方法进行研究，也是一个问题。研究的方法决定于研究对象的性质。如果研究的对象是受阶级影响的，当然要用阶级分析的方法。例如，在神经衰弱的致病原因中，对社会生活和工作的态度常是一个因素。有人对工作异常负责，夜以继日地工作，因过度疲劳而致病；有人昼夜考虑自己的名位待遇，对一切事都不如意，因抑郁忧虑而致病。这两种人显然具有不同的阶级意识，在诊断和治疗中必须考虑到这种差异。但在进行了这样阶级分析之后，还必须研究疲劳何以致病，忧虑何以致病，这里不能再用阶级分析而要用自然科学的方法了。
    人的意识活动并不全部都是受阶级影响的。心理学研究的主要对象，即人对客观现实的反映过程，是不随社会生活条件的变化而变化的。个性虽是社会生活条件的反映，同阶级地位有密切的关系，但个性的结构（个性表现的方面如能力、气质、兴趣等）和个性形成的规律，并不因阶级而异。心理学所研究的人在各种社会实践业务活动中的反映活动过程，也不因阶级不同或社会生活条件不同而不同。例如，儿童在两岁前后掌握语言的过程，炼钢工人对火焰火花的鉴别过程，在社会主义社会和资本主义社会并没有什么差别。心理学研究这些问题，必须因问题不同而采用不同的方法，而不应该对所有问题都应用阶级分析。事实上，对大部分的问题是不能应用阶级分析的。有人主张在研究阶级社会中人的心理时必须贯彻阶级分析，这本身可能是一种缺乏分析的说法。
    目前心理学还在幼年发育阶段，研究成果不多，研究方法也不够成熟。现在心理学研究的主要方法，还是在各种实践活动领域，观察和记录人的意识活动，从这样得来的材料中分析总结人的心理活动的规律。这样既可以获得科学成果，也可能协助解决实践活动中的问题。这是目前心理学中大量研究工作的方向。
    但是，科学研究需要进行深入分析，只观察记录是不够的。要获得确切的成果，还要在控制的条件下对基本过程进行分析，这就是实验法。过去心理学中不少研究成果，是从实验研究中获得的，不应该贬低实验方法的效用。随着实验方法技术的发展，过去无法在实验室中研究的，现在或将来也可能在实验室中进行研究。我们不能把心理现象简单化，以为一切问题立刻都能应用实验方法进行研究；也不能把心理现象神秘化，以为它是万分复杂的（这是事实），不可能用现代科学方法技术进行研究（这是武断的）。其实，心理意识也是物质运动（脑的活动）所产生的，所有的物质运动都有其共同的规律。例如，感觉活动过程同脉冲通讯系统非常类似，就是明证。心理学要研究脑的反映机能，对于脑活动时的内部情况，现在还无法直接观察，这是心理学研究工作遇到的主要困难之一。现代科学技术的发展，为研究脑的活动提供了新的可能。例如，利用讯息论和控制论理论、自动和遥控技术、电子和模拟计算技术等，模拟一些现实情境，模拟脑的某些活动过程，都是可能的了。并且，心理学者和有关科学工作者协作，也已经在这些方面进行着初步的研究。过去用照相机比拟眼睛，对眼的机能的了解曾有所帮助；现在利用现代科学技术进行脑的模拟，必将对于脑的活动规律有进一步的认识。对于脑的活动规律的了解，又可对机器的设计制造提供新的原则
  （模拟人体的机能而制造机器是技术史上常见的事）。我们相信，这种人脑同机器比拟的研究，可能是心理学的一个生长点，应当成为现代科学的一个重要领域。
    条件反射实验法对于脑的活动规律的研究有过不少贡献。现代脑电生理学可使我们借脑电现象观察脑的活动，也为研究脑的反映机能开辟了新的途径。心理学应当利用一切可能利用的科学上新成就，使用一切可能使用的方法，采取多路进军、四面围攻的战略，攻克意识活动这个坚强堡垒。
                    × × × ×
    心理学研究意识的起源、发生、发展和人对客观世界的反映过程。它为辩证唯物主义提供论据，进一步具体地论证物质第一性、意识第二性、意识是高度组织的物质的产物、意识是客观现实的反映。这些哲学命题，使辩证唯物主义更彻底地粉碎二元主义和唯心主义。所以心理学是辩证唯物主义哲学，特别是其认识论、反映论的主要科学基础。
    意识现象一向被认为是宇宙一谜，人类有史以来就想对它有所了解。黑格尔假定为宇宙本原的绝对理念，在其发展的最后阶段达到“自我认识”。这代表人类要求认识自己的认识的愿望，也表示认识自己的认识是认识的最高成就。黑格尔不能完成这个使命（任何个人也不能完成这个使命），绝对理念是唯心主义的虚构。辩证唯物主义为认识人的认识，奠定了基础，唯物主义辩证法就是自然、社会和思惟（意识、认识）的运动、发展的规律。心理学研究意识、认识活动的规律，认识了这些规律，也就认识了认识，而达到认识的最高峰。
