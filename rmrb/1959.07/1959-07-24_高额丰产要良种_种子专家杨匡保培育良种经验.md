High Yields Require Good Seeds
——Seed Expert Yang Kuangbao's Experience in Cultivating Superior Varieties
By Our Reporters You Qi and Zhu Xueru

	On a plain near Luqiao Town in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, the rice waves roll endlessly for dozens of miles.  Just after "Minor Heat," members of the Luqiao People's Commune began harvesting.  The first day's actual yield of dry grain averaged over 600 jin per mu, the second day increased to over 700 jin, and the third day continued to increase.  According to experienced farmers, the average and total yield will increase by at least 20% compared to last year.  While harvesting this bountiful fruit, the commune members can't help but think of Yang Kuangbao, the seed expert who cultivated them.
	The Luqiao People's Commune in Huangyan County planted over 70,000 mu of early rice, all using self-selected and self-bred superior varieties, with the most using the superior varieties cultivated by the farmer seed expert Yang Kuangbao.  Yang Kuangbao was originally the head of the First Team of Luqiao. After communization, he served as the Deputy Director of the Luqiao People's Commune and Director of the Seed Breeding Farm. Over the past seven or eight years, he has cultivated and propagated millions of jin of superior rice seeds, with two million jin sold to the state and transferred to other communes.  This year, the Luqiao People's Commune largely adopted the superior varieties selected and cultivated by Yang Kuangbao. The early rice across dozens of miles looks like a neat green carpet woven by skilled hands, with rice plants of uniform height, ears of the same size, and density also generally uniform, truly pleasing to the eye.  In particular, the 1,000 mu of early rice seed fields and over 1,000 mu of high-yield fields personally led by Yang Kuangbao are even more beautiful and magnificent.  No diseases, no pests, no barnyard grass, no empty ears, and little lodging.
	Yang Kuangbao not only cultivates a large number of superior varieties, but when he uses them as seeds, he selects the best among the good, the best among the best; not only does he go through ear selection, grain selection, and plot selection in the fields, but before sowing, he also goes through sun-drying, wind sieving, grain selection, yellow mud water selection, seed dressing with pesticides, soaking, and germination acceleration. The purity of the early rice seeds is generally above 97%, with the purity of the Luchai variety reaching about 99.5%, meeting the national first and second-grade superior seed standards. Therefore, their early rice sprouts vigorously, grows well, heads uniformly, matures consistently, has plump grains, and fewer barnyard grass and empty grains, which played an important role in this year's large-scale high-yield early rice production.  Yang Kuangbao is so serious and strict about breeding and selecting seeds because he has learned from years of practice that superior seeds are extremely important for high yields.  His argument is: "Like begets like, a dragon begets a dragon, a phoenix begets a phoenix, high yields require good seeds," "A good son needs a good mother, good seeds produce good grain."
	Yang Kuangbao not only pays attention to the cultivation and selection of superior varieties, but also emphasizes field management in large fields. His second argument is: With superior seeds, there must also be good cultivation management techniques to provide the superior seeds with good growing conditions. If the management is not good, the superior varieties will be transformed into inferior varieties, and high yields will be transformed into low yields. According to the same principle, since not all characteristics of inferior varieties are inferior, they can also be transformed into high-yield superior varieties through hybridization and changes in growing conditions. This is the law of transformation between the good and bad of varieties. The more than 70,000 mu of early rice in the Luqiao Commune, especially the early rice in the seed breeding farm and high-yield fields personally led by Yang Kuangbao, all achieved the technical requirements of early weeding and early fertilization, more weeding and more fertilization, test irrigation and frequent irrigation, and timely water draining, ensuring that all superior varieties fully exert their characteristics and enable the early rice to achieve large-scale high yields.
	Yang Kuangbao also has his own created new varieties, the most important of which is called "Large Grain Black Tip Glutinous Rice," which is a late rice variety that has been planted on a large scale in the Luqiao area for several years, yielding high yields every year. This superior variety was developed by Yang Kuangbao from several of the most prominent ears selected from the local superior variety "Black Tip Glutinous Rice" through years of single-plant breeding. It is now completely different from the original "Black Tip Glutinous Rice" and has become a new variety with large ears, many grains, strong stems, strong adaptability and resistance, and a yield that is about 20% higher than the original.
	In addition to the 1,000 mu of seed trial fields planted with superior varieties, Yang Kuangbao also has 7.5 mu of diversified variety trial fields where a hundred flowers bloom together. In this field, he planted 116 varieties of early rice seeds, some with tall stalks and large leaves, some with thin stalks and slender bodies, some with grain ears as black as sorghum, some with stalks as hard as reeds, some with large ears and many grains, and some with grains as sparse as morning stars, in short, tall and short, good and bad, everything is available. Yang Kuangbao observes the growth of various varieties and their characteristics here. According to their different characteristics, some are allowed to hybridize naturally, some are artificially pollinated, some are prepared for ear selection, and some are allowed to be eliminated. New superior varieties will be continuously discovered and cultivated here.

    高额丰产要良种
    ——种子专家杨匡保培育良种经验
    本报记者　尤淇　朱学儒
    在浙江省黄岩县路桥镇附近的一块平原上，几十里路之内，稻浪滚滚，一望无边。“小暑”刚过，路桥人民公社的社员就开镰收割了。第一天实收干谷平均每亩六百多斤，第二天增加到七百多斤，第三天继续有增加。据有经验的农民估计，平均产量和总产量至少将比去年增产二成以上。社员们一面收割这丰硕的果实，一面不由得不念道着培育它们的种子专家杨匡保。
    黄岩县路桥人民公社共种早稻七万多亩，全部采用自选自育的良种，其中又以采用农民种子专家杨匡保培育的良种为最多。杨匡保原是路桥一社的社长，公社化后担任路桥人民公社副主任兼良种繁育场场长。七、八年来，他已培育繁殖了优良稻种数百万斤，仅卖给国家和调剂给别社的良种就有二百万斤。今年路桥人民公社大部分采用了杨匡保选取和培育的良种，几十里地的早稻像妙手织成的一片整齐的绿色地毯，丘丘稻禾一般高低，穗头都一般大小，密度也一般均匀，真是谁看谁爱。特别是杨匡保亲自领导的良种繁育场所种的一千亩早稻种子田和一千多亩丰产田，长得更加秀丽壮观。没有病害，没有虫害，没有稗草，没有秕穗，很少倒伏。
    杨匡保不仅大量培育优良品种，当他把它们用作种子时，还要良中选良，好中选好；不仅在田里要经过穗选、粒选、片选，在播种前还要经过晒种、风筛、粒选、黄泥水选、药剂拌种、浸种和催芽。早稻种子的纯度一般都在97％以上，其中陆财号的纯度达到99.5％左右，符合国家制定的一、二级良种标准。因此他们的早稻出芽壮、生长好、抽穗齐、成熟一致、籽粒饱满、稗草秕谷少，对今年早稻大面积高额丰产起了重要的作用。杨匡保所以对育种、选种这样认真严格，是因为他多年的实践，了解到良种对高额丰产有极重大的关系。他的论点是：“龙生龙、凤生凤，高额丰产要良种”，“好儿要好娘，好种出好粮”。
    杨匡保不仅注意良种的培育和选取，而且十分讲究大田的田间管理。他的第二条论点是：有了良种，还要有良好的栽培管理技术，给良种以良好的生长条件。假如管理不好，良种会转化为劣种，高产会转化为低产。根据同样的道理，由于劣种并非所有的特性都是低劣的，经过杂交和生长条件的改变，也可以转化为高产的良种。这就是品种的良变和劣变的转化规律。路桥公社的七万多亩早稻，特别是杨匡保亲自领导的良种繁育场的早稻和丰产田的早稻，都做到了早耘早施肥，多耘多施肥，和试灌勤灌、及时搁田等技术要求，保证全部良种充分发挥它们的特性，使早稻获得大面积丰产。
    杨匡保也有他自己创造的新品种，其中最主要的一种叫“大粒乌咀糯”，是晚稻种，在路桥地区已大面积栽植了好几年，年年高产。这个良种就是杨匡保从本地良种“乌咀糯”里挑选出几株最突出的穗頳，经过多年单株培育养成的。它现在已完全不同于原来的“乌咀糯”，而成为一种穗大粒多、茎秆粗壮、适应性和抗逆性很强、产量要比原来的高20％左右的新品种了。
    杨匡保除了种植着一千亩田的良种的试育田外，另外还有七亩五分百花齐放的多品种试验田。在这块田里，他种了一百十六种各种品种的早稻种子，有的高秆大叶，有的细秆苗条，有的谷穗乌黑如高粱，有的秆硬如芦苇，有的穗大粒多，也有谷粒稀若晨星的，总之是高高矮矮、好好坏坏、应有尽有。杨匡保就从这里观察各种品种的生长情况和它们的特点，根据它们的不同特性，有的让它们自然杂交，有的进行人工授粉，有的准备穗选，有的就让它们被淘汰。新的优良品种，就将在这里被不断地发现和培育出来。
