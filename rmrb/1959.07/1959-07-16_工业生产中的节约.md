Economy in Industrial Production
Xu Xin Xue

Economy primarily refers to the saving of manpower and materials, that is, the saving of living labor and materialized labor. If we do a good job in economizing, China's economic development may be faster; if we do not do a good job in economizing, China's economic development will be slower. The less manpower and materials consumed per unit of product, the more products people can obtain by spending the same amount of manpower and materials. Therefore, economy itself is an extremely important condition for production development.

Economy should be paid attention to by all departments, especially industrial production departments. The production of any industrial product requires the consumption of certain raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, the consumption of certain labor, and the consumption of certain management expenses. The specific conditions of each industrial production department are different, and the proportion of this consumption in different products is also different. Under the current circumstances in China, generally speaking, in the production cost of industrial products, the consumption of raw materials, materials, and auxiliary materials accounts for about 80%, the consumption of fuel and power accounts for about 3%, the depreciation of fixed assets accounts for about 2%, wages and additional wages account for about 10%, and management expenses account for about 5%. Among them, raw materials, materials, fuel, electricity, and fixed asset depreciation belong to the consumption of material, that is, materialized labor; wages, additional wages, and a part of management expenses belong to the consumption of manpower, that is, living labor (another part of management expenses also belongs to the consumption of material, such as the consumption of office supplies, etc.). Economy in industrial production is to save the various consumptions mentioned above.

Because the consumption of material, that is, materialized labor, accounts for the highest proportion in the production cost of industrial products, we will first talk about saving material consumption.

Is the potential for saving material consumption in industrial production large? We believe it is very large. Taking the production of small blast furnaces as an example, some advanced units, such as the small blast furnace of Jinan Shengjian Steel Plant in Shandong Province, only need 970 kilograms of coke to smelt one ton of pig iron; the 13-cubic-meter small blast furnace in Yunnan Province consumes as little as 880 kilograms of coke to smelt one ton of pig iron. However, some other small blast furnaces consume nearly 2,000 kilograms of coke to smelt one ton of pig iron. If the coke consumption of small blast furnaces can be reduced to the level of advanced units, or close to the level of advanced units, a large amount of coke can be saved. In fact, the average consumption of coke and limestone in small blast furnaces nationwide in April this year decreased by 16% compared with February. Among them, the small blast furnace of Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant used lime instead of limestone as a flux, and the amount of iron produced per cubic meter of blast furnace volume increased from one ton to one and a half tons per day and night; the coke consumed per ton of pig iron was also reduced from 1,900 kilograms to 1,200 kilograms, and the production cost was reduced by 22%. This fact proves that as long as we earnestly summarize the production experience of these advanced small blast furnaces and are good at analyzing the different specific conditions in various places to promote these advanced experiences, the material consumption in the production of small blast furnaces can be completely reduced. It is groundless to think that the material consumption in the production of small blast furnaces cannot be reduced. If the material consumption in the production of small blast furnaces can be greatly reduced, is it impossible to reduce the material consumption in the production of large and medium-sized blast furnaces? Of course, it is also possible. For example, some large blast furnaces consume 1,000 kilograms of coke to smelt one ton of pig iron, while advanced blast furnaces such as Benxi only consume more than 600 kilograms. If all the large and medium-sized blast furnaces in the country can be reduced to the coke consumption level of advanced blast furnaces, we can also save a lot of coke. These examples prove that there is a great possibility of saving material consumption in our enterprises. This is the case in the iron and steel industry, and it is also the case in other industries, small enterprises, and large enterprises. All industrial departments and all types of enterprises should pay full attention to the saving of material; because the production of large enterprises occupies a major position in our entire production, the issue of saving material consumption in large enterprises should be paid special attention.

In order to save material consumption in industrial production, we should improve our work in the following aspects.

The quality of product design has a great relationship with saving material consumption in the product manufacturing process. Poor product design results in large material consumption and low efficiency, or the use of superior materials to manufacture inferior products; good product design results in less material consumption and high efficiency, or the use of materials that are generally considered to be inferior to manufacture superior products. For example, under the condition that the volume and weight of the machine remain unchanged, increase its efficiency; or, under the condition of ensuring the efficiency of the machine, reduce its volume and weight. According to possible conditions, continuously adopt new technologies and new process methods, and continuously improve product design, which is an important measure to save material consumption. China's original industrial base was very weak. After liberation, with the help of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, we built a large number of modernized enterprises; however, the technical level of most of the original enterprises was still very low, and many of the product designs of these enterprises were outdated and unreasonable. In the past few years, especially since last year, the broad masses of workers and technical personnel have worked together, brought into play the creative spirit of daring to think and daring to do, and modified these unreasonable product designs, which has greatly reduced the material consumption and greatly improved the efficiency of many products, achieving good results. However, there are still many product designs that should be improved that have not yet been improved, and those that have been improved can continue to be improved. Therefore, how to make backward product designs catch up with advanced product designs, and how to continuously improve product designs that have already been improved, so as to reduce the material consumption per unit of product as much as possible while improving product efficiency, is still a task that we should seriously solve in the future. Backward things become advanced things, and advanced things become more advanced things. This is the objective law of the development of things. It is certainly wrong to think that the improvement work of all original backward product designs has been completely done; it is also wrong to think that advanced product designs can no longer be continuously improved. We should continuously improve various product designs based on production practice and the development of science and technology, save material consumption, and improve use efficiency. Of course, whether it is for backward product designs or advanced product designs, a realistic and responsible attitude should be adopted when improving them. After repeated tests and trials, and indeed proven successful, and after being identified by a certain national management agency, they can be gradually promoted. In particular, the improvement of those advanced product designs should be more cautious. Some enterprises modify advanced product designs arbitrarily and carelessly without serious testing and without reporting to the relevant superior management agencies for approval. As a result, they not only reduce the use efficiency of the products, but also actually cause waste of materials. This lesson must be remembered.

Improving product quality and minimizing waste parts and defective products is another important measure to save material consumption. When carrying out industrial production, we must take into account the quantity and quality of products. This has recently attracted the attention of various production units, and there have been improvements of varying degrees in the work. If we only pay attention to increasing quantity and not to improving quality, it will cause a great waste. Because using the same materials to manufacture the same products, if the quality is not good, it will inevitably reduce the use efficiency and shorten the service life, causing waste of materials; conversely, if the quality of the products is improved, the use efficiency can be improved and the service life can be extended, which is actually a great saving. In terms of improving product quality, we must make serious efforts in the future to ensure that every product produced by each enterprise is of excellent quality, and to minimize waste parts and defective products as much as possible. It is very bad that the quality of the products produced by some factories has improved, but the waste parts and defective products produced inside the factories have not decreased or even increased. We must never use the method of increasing waste parts and defective products to achieve the goal of improving product quality. On the contrary, we should produce no or as few waste parts and defective products as possible in every link of the production process to achieve the requirement of improving product quality; we should maximize the pass rate of products and minimize the rejection rate and the rate of substandard products. Only by establishing such a comprehensive viewpoint and taking active measures can we maximize the saving of material consumption in the product manufacturing process.

In order to save material consumption in the production process, we should also use raw materials and materials reasonably. In this regard, we should pay attention to two deviations: one is using large materials for small purposes, using good materials for inferior purposes, and not recycling and utilizing waste materials and waste materials, which will of course cause waste of materials. This waste phenomenon still exists in large quantities in many enterprises, and has not yet attracted the attention it deserves from the leaders of these enterprises. Allowing this phenomenon to continue to exist is obviously not in line with the Party's general policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Another deviation is to replace large materials with small materials, and to replace good materials with inferior materials, and even to use some waste materials and waste materials as good materials. This situation seems to be saving on the surface, but in reality it will inevitably reduce the quality and use efficiency of the products, which will cause waste instead. To overcome these two deviations, we need to do a lot of detailed work in ideological education, and at the same time, we need to take a series of specific organizational measures. That is: in the use of raw materials and materials, we must fully consider the reasonable requirements of product design, the resource conditions at that time and locally, and the equipment and technical conditions of the enterprise; at the same time, we must strengthen scientific research and experimental work, actively create relevant and necessary new conditions, discover new raw materials and substitute materials, and expand the new uses of original raw materials and materials, and promote comprehensive utilization, so as to achieve the maximum economic rationality in the use of materials. In the supply and scheduling of raw materials and materials, we must fully understand the specific requirements of different enterprises, and meet their needs according to quality, quantity, and time, and try to avoid the unreasonable phenomenon of supplying those materials that are needed. In the management of raw materials and materials, we must avoid deterioration, loss, and other phenomena as much as possible, strengthen the responsibility system for warehouse management, and establish and improve the material requisition and return system.

In order to save material consumption, we should also reasonably improve the utilization rate of equipment, and do a good job in equipment maintenance and repair. Since the Great Leap Forward, the utilization rate of equipment has greatly improved, which is a good thing. Of course, the efficiency improvement of any equipment is not unlimited. Within the limit, improving the utilization rate as much as possible is a saving that we must strive for, and as far as the situation of many enterprises is concerned, their equipment utilization rate is still low, and there is still a great possibility of continuing to improve it. We should also continue to explore the potential in this area and improve the utilization rate of equipment. This is one aspect. However, on the other hand, it should also be pointed out that if the limit of equipment capacity is exceeded and the utilization rate is arbitrarily increased, it will not only not save, but may cause waste and greatly shorten the service life of the equipment. Similarly, any equipment needs maintenance and repair, and needs certain spare parts and accessories to be regularly replenished. Not maintaining when it should be maintained; not repairing when it should be repaired; not replenishing when it should be replenished, operating with "illness" may turn "minor illnesses" into "major illnesses," and may cause great waste in reality because of the pursuit of small savings. Therefore, we must take the following measures to strengthen equipment maintenance and repair work. That is to strengthen technical management, implement operating procedures, and strictly implement the regular maintenance system, and the maintenance period cannot be postponed because of rushing tasks.

Next, let's talk about the problem of saving manpower, that is, saving the consumption of living labor. The potential in this area is also very large. Some people believe that many new workers have been added last year, their skills are not proficient, and it is difficult to improve labor productivity, and the potential for saving labor consumption is not large. This view is one-sided. It is a temporary phenomenon that new workers are not as skilled as old workers when they work. Many new workers are very enthusiastic about learning technology. As long as the leadership often pays attention to strengthening their political and technical education, and the old workers help them enthusiastically and patiently, the progress of new workers is often very fast. Some new workers have been working like regular workers and doing well in less than half a year after entering the factory. This shows that with more new workers, the potential for improving labor productivity and saving manpower is not smaller, but greater. Taking ironmaking as an example, last year, for every ton of pig iron produced by a small blast furnace, from mining and transportation to smelting iron, some factories needed to equip 70 or 80 or even more laborers; since this year, due to the implementation of the "five fixed" work of fixed point, fixed type, fixed group, fixed number, and fixed responsibility system, and the improvement of workers' smelting technology, the same production process now only needs to equip 40 or 50 laborers, and advanced small blast furnaces use even fewer people. Not only is ironmaking like this, but also coal mining, machine manufacturing, etc. For example, Huainan Coal Mine recently adjusted the labor organization and adopted advanced coal mining methods, and tapped the labor potential within the enterprise, and the production efficiency increased by 30%. In February this year, the average daily output of coal per person in the entire mine was 1.4 tons, and in April it increased to more than 1.8 tons. As a result, more than 9,800 people were adjusted out to support agricultural production and strengthen other departments that need labor, while the total coal production increased by 76% compared with the same period last year. The coal industry is a department with rapid production growth and a large need for labor. After adjusting the labor organization and improving technology, the enterprises in this department can still tap so much labor potential. Then, the labor potential contained in other industrial departments can be imagined.

In order to save manpower consumption in industrial production, according to existing experience, work should be improved mainly from the following two aspects.

The first is to improve labor organization. Each enterprise should carry out reasonable staffing work based on this year's production tasks and taking into account the needs of labor reserves for next year, adjust the current surplus employees so as to strengthen other departments that really need labor, first of all the agricultural production department. Each enterprise must organize labor reasonably according to the requirements of balanced production in each workshop and each month, and try to avoid the phenomenon of idling at one time and rushing at another time, idling in one workshop and rushing in another workshop. Each enterprise should appropriately arrange skilled labor and unskilled labor, main labor and auxiliary labor according to the situation of its own equipment and the needs of production, and try to reduce those unskilled, especially auxiliary, labor that is really not needed in production. At the same time, it is necessary to determine the responsibility of each worker in each period and each production post, strengthen the cooperation between workers and workers, groups and groups, workshops and workshops, and overcome the phenomena of no one being responsible and uncoordinated in production.

The second is to improve the technical level of workers and actively carry out mass movements of technical innovation and technical revolution. Because the proportion of new workers is very large at present, and many new and technically complex enterprises are constantly being put into production, strengthening the technical training of new workers and further improving the technical level of old workers is an important source of practicing economy in industrial production. As long as the technical level of workers is improved, we can use the same number of workers and the same number of equipment to produce more and better products. For this reason, it is necessary to actively carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, organize socialist labor competitions, promote the experience of advanced producers, and gradually adopt mechanized and semi-mechanized equipment according to the needs of production and possible conditions, and reduce heavy manual labor and semi-manual labor as much as possible. In addition, while doing a good job in the political and ideological education of the workers, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the wage policy of distribution according to work and more pay for more work. In this way, labor productivity can be greatly improved, and the labor consumption per unit of product can be greatly reduced.

Strengthening the planning of industrial production is extremely important for saving manpower and materials. Reasonable planning brings the greatest savings in manpower and materials. Each department and each enterprise must formulate planned targets that are in line with the actual situation according to the possibilities and needs, and do a good job in the comprehensive balance within and outside the enterprise, so that the various workshops within the enterprise and the relevant production units outside the enterprise can better cooperate in production, supply, sales, and transportation, and avoid the phenomenon of products not being complete, semi-finished products being backlogged, and other mutual disconnections due to the failure of targets to be implemented and frequent changes.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Any socialist economic undertaking must pay attention to making the fullest possible use of manpower and equipment, improving labor organization, improving management and administration, and raising labor productivity, economizing on all possible manpower and materials, and implementing labor emulation and economic accounting, in order to reduce costs year by year, increase personal income, and increase accumulation. ...Much work must be done in this respect." ("Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside") We must conscientiously implement Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions so that the economy work on the entire industrial production front can achieve greater results, so as to carry out socialist construction in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    工业生产中的节约
    许辛学
    节约，主要是人力和物力的节约，也就是活劳动和物化劳动的节约。我们的节约工作做得好，我国经济的发展就有可能快一些；节约工作做得不好，我国经济的发展就会慢一些。每个单位产品的人力和物力消耗越少，那末，人们花费同样多的人力和物力，就可以得到更多的产品。所以节约本身，就是生产发展的一个极其重要的条件。
    节约是一切部门都应当注意的，工业生产部门尤其应当注意。生产任何一件工业产品，都需要消耗一定的原料、材料、燃料、电力，消耗一定的劳动，消耗一定的管理费用。各个工业生产部门的具体情况不同，这种消耗在不同的产品中所占的比例也不一样。在我国目前情况下，一般说来，在工业产品的生产费用里面，原料、材料和辅助材料的消耗约占80％左右，燃料和动力的消耗约占3％左右，固定资产折旧约占2％左右，工资和附加工资约占10％左右，管理费用约占5％左右。其中原料、材料、燃料、电力和固定资产折旧等，是属于物力即物化劳动的消耗；工资、附加工资以及管理费用中的一部分，是属于人力即活劳动的消耗（管理费用的另一部分也是属于物力的消耗，如办公用具的消耗等等）。工业生产中的节约，就是要节约上面所说的各种消耗。
    因为物力即物化劳动的消耗在工业产品的生产费用里面所占的比例最高，所以我们首先从节约物力说起。
    在工业生产中节约物力消耗的潜在力大不大呢？我们认为是很大的。拿小高炉的生产来说，有些先进的单位，例如山东省的济南生建钢铁厂的小高炉，冶炼一吨生铁只需焦炭九百七十公斤；云南省的十三立方米的小高炉，冶炼一吨生铁消耗的焦炭，最低的只有八百八十公斤。另外有些小高炉冶炼一吨生铁所消耗的焦炭，却将近两千公斤。如果小高炉的焦炭消耗数量都能降低到先进单位的水平，或者接近先进单位的水平，那末，就可以节约出大量的焦炭来。事实上，今年4月份全国小高炉的焦炭、石灰石的平均消耗就比2月份下降了16％。其中唐山炼铁厂的小高炉利用石灰代替石灰石做熔剂，每一立方米的高炉容积，每一昼夜出铁的数量就由一吨提高到一吨半；冶炼每吨生铁所消耗的焦炭也由一千九百公斤降低到一千二百公斤，生产成本降低了22％。这个事实证明：只要我们认真地总结这些先进小高炉的生产经验，并且善于分析各地不同的具体情况推广这些先进经验，小高炉生产中的物力消耗是完全可以降低的，认为小高炉生产的物力消耗不能降低的说法是没有根据的。小高炉生产的物力消耗可以大大降低，那么，大高炉、中高炉生产的物力消耗是不是就不可能降低了呢？当然也是可能的。例如，有的大高炉冶炼一吨生铁要消耗焦炭一千公斤，而像本溪等先进的高炉，只消耗六百多公斤。如果全国所有的大、中型高炉都能够降低到先进高炉的焦炭消耗水平，我们同样可以节约很多焦炭。这些例子证明了在我们的企业中有着节约物力消耗的很大的可能性。钢铁工业方面是这样，其他工业方面也是这样，小的企业是这样，大的企业也是这样。各个工业部门，各种类型的企业，都应当充分地注意物力的节约；由于大型企业的生产在我们整个生产中占着主要的地位，所以大型企业节约物力消耗的问题，更应当特别注意。
    为了节约工业生产中的物力消耗，我们应当从下列几个方面来改进工作。
    产品设计的好坏，对于产品制造过程中节约物力消耗的关系很大。不好的产品设计，用料大而效率低，或者是用优等的材料，而制造出劣等的产品；好的产品设计，用料少而效率高，或者是用一般看来是次等的材料而制造出优等的产品。例如，在机器的体积和重量不变的条件下，提高它的效能；或者是在保证机器的效能的条件下，缩小它的体积，减轻它的重量。根据可能的条件，不断地采用新的技术和新的工艺方法，不断地改进产品设计，是节约物力消耗的一个重要措施。我国原来的工业基础很薄弱，解放以后，在苏联和其他兄弟国家的帮助下，我们建设了大批的近代化企业；但是，原有的多数企业，技术水平还是很低的，这些企业的产品设计有许多是陈旧的、不合理的。几年以来，特别是去年以来，广大工人群众和技术人员一起，发挥了敢想敢做的创造精神，对于这些不合理的产品设计，进行了修改，使很多产品的材料消耗大大降低，使用效能大大提高，取得了很好的成绩。但是，有不少应当改进的产品设计还没有改进，已经改进的还可以继续改进。因此，如何使落后的产品设计向先进的产品设计看齐，如何使已经有了改进的产品设计继续提高，以便在提高产品使用效能的同时，尽可能地减少单位产品的物力消耗，这仍然是我们今后应当认真解决的任务。落后的东西变成先进的东西，先进的东西变成更先进的东西，这是事物发展的客观规律。认为一切原有的落后的产品设计的改进工作已经完全做好了，这固然是不对的；以为先进的产品设计再不能继续改进了，这也是不对的。我们应当根据生产实践和科学技术的发展，不断地改进各种产品设计，节约物力消耗，提高使用效能。当然，不论对于落后的产品设计或者是先进的产品设计，在改进它们的时候，都应当采取实事求是、谨慎负责的态度，经过反复试验和试制，确实证明成功，并且由国家一定的管理机关鉴定以后，才能逐步推广。特别是对于那些先进的产品设计的改进，更要慎重。某些企业不经过认真的试验，不报请有关的上级管理机关批准，就随意地、不慎重地修改先进的产品设计，结果不但降低了产品的使用效能，而且在实际上造成了物力的浪费，这个教训是必须记取的。
    提高产品质量，尽量减少废件和废品，这是节约物力消耗的另一项重要措施。在进行工业生产的时候，必须兼顾产品的数量和质量的问题，最近已经引起了各个生产单位的注意，并且在工作上已经有了不同程度的改进。如果只注意增加数量，不注意提高质量，就会造成很大的浪费。因为用同样的材料，制造同样的产品，如果质量不好，就势必降低使用效能，缩短使用年限，造成物力的浪费；反之如果产品的质量提高了，就可以提高使用效能，延长使用年限，这实际上就是一种很大的节约。在提高产品的质量方面，我们今后还要做认真的努力，保证每个企业出厂的每个产品都是质量优良的，并且尽可能地减少废件和废品。有些工厂出厂的产品的质量提高了，但是工厂内部生产的废件和废品却没有减少甚至增加了，这是很不好的。我们决不能够用增加废件、废品的办法，来达到提高产品质量的目的，相反，应当在生产过程的每个环节中，不出或者尽可能不出废件、废品，来实现提高产品质量的要求；应当最大限度地提高产品的合格率，最大限度地降低废品率和次品率。只有树立这样全面的观点，采取积极的措施，才能在产品制造过程中最大限度地节约物力的消耗。
    为着在生产过程中节约物力的消耗，我们还应当合理地使用原料、材料。在这方面，要注意两种偏向：一种是大材小用，优材劣用，废材、废料不回收利用，这当然会造成物力的浪费。这种浪费现象，在不少企业中还大量存在，还没有引起这些企业的领导同志们的应有注意。容许这种现象继续存在，显然是不符合党的多快好省这个总方针的要求的。另一种偏向是，该用大材的用小材代替，该用优材的用劣材代替，甚至把一些废材、废料也当好材、好料使用。这种情况，表面上好像是节约了，实际上必然降低产品的质量和使用效率，反而造成浪费。克服这两种偏向，我们需要在思想教育方面做很多细致的工作，同时更需要采取一系列的具体的组织措施。这就是：在原料、材料的使用上，要充分考虑到产品设计的合理要求，当时、当地的资源条件，本企业的设备和技术条件；同时，要加强科学研究和试验工作，积极地创造有关的和必要的新条件，发现新的原料和代用材料，并且扩大原有原料、材料的新用途，推行综合利用，从而做到材料利用上的最大限度的经济合理。在原料、材料的供应和调度上，要充分了解不同企业的具体要求，按质、按量、按时地满足他们的需要，尽量避免需要这种材料而供应那种材料的不合理的现象。在原料、材料的管理上，要尽可能地避免变质、损耗等现象，加强仓库保管工作的责任制度，建立和健全领料、退料制度。
    为了节约物力的消耗，还应当合理地提高设备的利用率，并且做好设备的保养和维修工作。大跃进以来，设备的利用率有了很大的提高，这是一件好事。当然任何设备的效率的提高，都不是没有限度的。在限度以内，尽可能地提高利用率，这种节约是我们必须争取的，而且就不少企业的情况来说，它们的设备利用率还是低的，继续提高的可能性还是很大的。我们还应当不断地发掘这方面的潜力，提高设备的利用率。这是一方面。但是，另一方面，也要指出，如果超过了设备能力的限度，任意地提高利用率，这就不但不会节约，而且可能造成浪费，使设备的使用年限大大缩短。同样，任何设备都是需要保养和维修的，都是需要一定的备品、配件来经常补充的。该保养，不保养；该维修，不维修；该补充，不补充，带“病”运转，这就可能使“小病”变成“大病”，可能因为追求小的节约，而实际上造成很大的浪费。因此，我们必须采取下列办法，来加强设备的保养和维修工作。这就是要加强技术管理，贯彻操作规程，严格执行定期的检修制度，不能因为赶任务而推迟检修的期限。
    下面，我们来说一说节约人力即节约活劳动消耗的问题。这方面的潜力，同样也是很大的。有人认为，去年增加了很多新工人，他们的技术不熟练，提高劳动生产率有困难，节约劳动消耗的潜力不大。这种看法是片面的。新工人技术不熟练，干起活来比不上老工人，这是暂时的现象。许多新工人学习技术的热情很高，只要领导上经常注意加强对他们的政治和技术教育，老工人热情而耐心地帮助他们，新工人的进步，往往是很快的。有的新工人，进厂不到半年，就和正式工人一样地干活，并且干得挺好。这就说明，新工人多了，提高劳动生产率、节约人力的潜力，不是更小，而是更大。拿炼铁来说，去年小高炉每生产一吨生铁，从挖矿、运输到炼出铁来，有的工厂要配备七、八十个甚至更多的劳动力；今年以来，由于进行了定点、定型、定组、定员、定责任制等“五定”工作，并且提高了工人的冶炼技术，现在同样的生产过程，只需要配备四、五十个劳动力就够了，先进的小高炉用的人更少。不但炼铁如此，采煤、制造机器等等，也莫不如此。例如，淮南煤矿最近由于调整了劳动组织，采用了先进的采煤方法，挖掘了企业内部的劳动潜力，生产效率就提高了30％。今年2月份全矿每人每日平均生产煤炭一点四吨，4月份就提高到一点八吨以上。结果调整出来了九千八百多人，支援农业生产和加强其他需要劳动力的部门，而煤炭的生产总量却比去年同期增长了76％。煤炭工业部门是一个生产增长很快、需要劳动力很多的部门，这个部门的企业经过调整劳动组织、提高技术之后，还能够挖掘出来这么多的劳动潜力，那么，其他工业部门所蕴藏的劳动潜力，也就可想而知了。
    为了节约工业生产中的人力消耗，根据已有的经验，主要地应当从下列两个方面来改进工作。
    首先是改善劳动组织。各个企业应当根据今年的生产任务，并且考虑到明年劳动后备的需要，实行合理的定员工作，把目前多余的职工调整出来，以便加强其他真正需要劳动力的部门，首先是农业生产部门。每个企业都要按照各个车间、各个月份均衡生产的要求，合理地组织劳动力，尽量避免一时窝工，一时赶工，这个车间窝工，那个车间赶工的现象。每个企业要按照自己设备的情况和生产的需要，适当地安排熟练劳动和非熟练劳动、主要劳动和辅助劳动，尽量地减少那些生产上确实不需要的非熟练的特别是辅助的劳动力。同时，要确定每个工人在每个时期、每个生产岗位上的责任，加强工人和工人、小组和小组、车间和车间的协作，克服生产中无人负责和不协调的现象。
    其次是提高工人的技术水平，积极开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。由于目前新工人的比重很大，许多新的、技术复杂的企业又在不断地投入生产，因此，加强对新工人的技术训练，进一步提高老工人的技术水平是工业生产中厉行节约的一个重要源泉。只要工人的技术水平提高了，我们就可以用同样多的工人，运用同样多的设备，而生产出更多、更好的产品。为此，就要积极开展技术革新和技术革命，组织社会主义劳动竞赛，推广先进生产者的经验，根据生产的需要和可能的条件，逐步地采用机械化和半机械化的设备，尽可能地减少笨重的手工劳动和半手工劳动。此外，还要在做好对工人群众政治思想教育的同时，认真地贯彻执行按劳分配、多劳多得的工资政策。这样，劳动生产率就可以大大提高，单位产品的劳动消耗也就可以大大降低。
    加强工业生产的计划性，对于节约人力、物力极为重要。合理的计划带来的人力物力的节约是最大的节约。每个部门、每个企业都要按照可能和需要，制定符合于实际情况的计划指标，并且做好企业内部和外部的综合平衡工作，使企业内部的各个车间和企业外部有关生产单位之间，在生产、供应、销售和运输等方面更好地协作配合，避免因为指标不落实而常常变动，以致发生产品不能成套、半成品积压和其他相互脱节的现象。
    毛泽东同志说：“任何社会主义的经济事业，必须注意尽可能充分地利用人力和设备，尽可能改善劳动组织、改善经营管理和提高劳动生产率，节约一切可能节约的人力和物力，实行劳动竞赛和经济核算，借以逐年降低成本，增加个人收入和增加积累。……在这方面，必须进行许多工作。”（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”）我们必须认真地执行毛泽东同志的指示，使整个工业生产战线上的节约工作获得更大的成绩，从而多快好省地进行社会主义的建设。　（原载“红旗”杂志第十四期）
